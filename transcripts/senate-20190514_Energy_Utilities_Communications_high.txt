AND AT JUST TO GIVE YOU A BRIEF BACKGROUND ON ESSAY AT THE END OF TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THE LEGISLATURE UNANIMOUSLY ADOPTED SB SIXTY TWO FROM SENATOR HILL CREATING P. UC CODE. THREE OH NINE DOT EIGHT ESTABLISHING OSA. ESTABLISH THESE GOALS FOR OSA ADVOCATE AS A PARTY OF CPUC PROCEEDINGS AND ON BEHALF OF THE INTERESTS OF PUBLIC UTILITIES CUSTOMERS FOR EFFECTIVE PUBLIC UTILITIES SAFETY MANAGEMENT. AND INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS RECOMMEND IMPROVEMENTS TO THE CPU SEES OWN SAFETY MANAGEMENT POLICY AND PROCEDURES AND ITS SAFETY CULTURE. AND INFORM THE OFFICIAL RECORD ON SAFETY RELATED RISK IN APPLICABLES CPUC PROCEEDINGS AND ASSIST THE CPUC IN ITS EFFORTS TO HOLD PUBLIC UTILITIES ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR SAFE OPERATION. IN -- TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN I SAY RECOMMENDED ADVOCATED IMPOSE PROMOTED SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS OVER A BROAD SPECTRUM OF UTILITY PROGRAMS INCLUDING ELECTRIC WILDFIRE GAS PIPELINE IN GAS TORTUROUS. WELL I SAY IS MISSION STATEMENT IS TO ADVOCATE FOR THE CONTINUOUS COST EFFECTIVE IMPROVEMENT OF SAFETY MANAGEMENT SEE PERFORMANCE THE PUBLIC UTILITIES PREVENT ACCIDENTS INJURIES AND TO SAVE LIVES. AS OF LAST MONTH AS AN UPDATE -- ESSAY ISNOW COMPRISED OF FOUR SENIOR ENGINEERS AND THREE SENIOR ANALYST WITH APPROXIMATELY ONE THIRD STAFF LOCATED HE EACH OF THE P. YOU SEE SACRAMENTO LA AND SAN FRANCISCO OFFICES. IN THE LAST YEAR WE HAVE BEEN ACTIVE IN OVER A DOZEN PROCEEDINGS AT THE COMMISSION AND PURPOSE DO YOU SEE THREE OH NINE DIED EIGHT WELL I SAY SUBMITS ITS ANNUAL REPORT DIRECTLY TO THE LEGISLATURE IN JANUARY OF EACH YEAR. DESCRIBING ITS WORK. YOU SEE THREE OH NIGHT AT EIGHT INCLUDES A SON CLICK SEC CLIENTS. ON THE BUDGET PREPONDERANCE. NEW SO THAT IS PART OF THIS -- SB. NINE ONE NINETY NINE THE BILL THAT'S BEEN -- SUBMITTED -- WE PROVIDED -- COPIES OF OUR JANUARY US A MIDDLE REPORT THAT WE US. AND JUST TO HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE OF ELEMENTS OUT OF THAT REPORT. I'M ON PAGE SIX OF THE REPORT WE DISCUSSED WHAT WE DID WITH WILD FIRE RISK. I'M EVEN AS THAT DEVELOPED AS THE AS A RULE MAKING FROM SB NINE A ONE WAS WAS BEING DEVELOPED -- I SAY MEANT WITH COMMISSIONERS. TO ADVOCATE THAT THE SCOPE OF THAT INCLUDE TRANSMISSION ELECT EXPLICITLY INCLUDE ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION AND WE'RE PLEASED THAT THE COMMISSION DID INCLUDE THAT IN THE SCOPE AS ALSO MAYBE TRANSMISSION INDEPENDENT TRANSMISSION OWNERS. AS RESPONDENTS AS PART OF THAT PROCEEDING -- I ALSO WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT ON PAGE. EIGHT WE WE CONDUCTED A SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM ON BALK FACILITATED. FOR COMMISSIONERS. THAT WAS. BASICALLY TO GET THE WORD OUT AND TO SHARE BEST PRACTICES AND EXPERIENCES AND UNDERSTANDINGS FROM A NUMBER OF ENTITIES EXPERTS FROM ACADEMIA -- AND ALSO FROM THE UTILITIES. AND AND FROM THE REGULATOR ON AND I I I'LL COME BACK TO THAT IN JUST A MOMENT BUT I ALSO WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT ON PAGE. ELEVEN IN FOR EXAMPLE IN A RAPE CASE WAS A GAS PIPELINE RISK. ON THERE'S A PICTURE IN THAT OF A CRATER FROM A OF FAILED GAS TRANSMISSION PIPELINE FORTUNATELY THAT WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DESERT. HOWEVER IT IT HIGHLIGHTS THE THE ON GOING RISK OF OF OF OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS AGING INSIDE OF CALIFORNIA WE ADVOCATED THAT PROCEEDING A COUPLE OF THINGS OF NOTE. WE WE RECOMMENDED IN THAT PROCEEDING THAT. THAT THERE THE COMMISSION REQUIRE A STATE TO CULTURE INVESTIGATION OF THAT UTILITY AND WE ALSO OPPOSED A UTILITY PROPOSED PLAN IN WHICH THEY WERE GOING. TO PROPOSE THAT THEY DO A PROJECTS SUBSTITUTION IN TERMS OF ITS -- INVESTMENT IN IN SAFETY THEY THEY PROPOSE THAT. THAT MAY NOT EXCEED WHAT WAS AUTHORIZED IN IN THAT CASE THEY WOULD SUBSTITUTE PROGRAMS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY DIDN'T -- EXCEED WHAT WAS AUTHORIZED OSA ADVOCATED THAT THAT NOT BE A CONSTRAINT THAT THAT THE UTILITY MUST GO AND AND INVEST IN WHATEVER IS NEEDED IN THE SAFETY PROGRAMS BUT NOT UC AUTHORIZATION HAS A LIMIT TO IN TERMS OF THEIR SAFETY. INVESTMENTS ON AND THEN -- FINALLY ON THE VERY LAST PAGE ON PAGE THIRTY WE WE WE KIND OF HIGHLIGHTING CATEGORIZE OUR ROAD MAP IN TERMS OF THE ELEMENTS THAT SB -- SIXTY TWO MANDATES. FOR US IN WHICH THE ROADMAP INCLUDES FOR EXAMPLE ON PAGE THIRTY AT THE VERY END YOU KNOW THE OUR OUR WORK IN TERMS OF THE PROCEEDINGS ARE WORK. I UTILITY SAFETY MANAGEMENT CULTURE AND INFRASTRUCTURE AND THEN OUR WORK IN TERMS OF CPU SEE SAFETY MANAGEMENT. AND JUST TO HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE OF THINGS FROM THAT. SAFETY ON BOND THAT WE HAD ON SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM SO WHEN WE READ THAT IN THE IN THE CODE IN IN THE STATUTE. WITH A FOCUS ON SAFETY MANAGEMENT AND SAFETY CULTURE WE LOOK AT THAT AS WHAT BETTER PLACE TO GO THEN TO LOOK AT SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM STANDARD. AND THEN LOOK AND SEE HOW THOSE COULD BE BROUGHT TO THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY UTILITIES ALREADY SEVERAL INDUSTRIES REGULATIONS ARE ADOPTING SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS AND STANDARDS TO IMPROVE SAFETY F. A. A. JUST MADE THEM A REQUIREMENT I BELIEVE THE LAST YEAR. AB I HAS THE STANDARDS. NATIONAL ENERGY BOARD ACTUALLY HAS STANDARD FOR SAFETY MANAGEMENT WHICH THE REGULATOR ARTISTS TO THEM FTA HAS COME OUT WITH THEM. THERE'S A CALIFORNIA IN ACCIDENTAL RELEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM MARITIME. AND THERE'S THE INTERNATIONAL MARITIME ORGANIZATION I'M AND ALSO AS PART OF THAT SAFETY ON BOND. WE WE ALSO DESCRIBE SOME OF THE MAJOR ELEMENTS OF A SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM INCLUDING LEADERSHIP SAFETY CULTURE STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT RISK MANAGEMENT OPERATIONAL CONTROL SAFETY ASSURANCE QUALITY ASSURANCE. INVESTIGATED CAUSE I'M GOING TO ALL OF THEM. I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT -- A COUPLE OF THE SPEAKERS THERE. WE HAD SOMEONE FROM CONTRA COSTA COUNTY WHO GAVE A PRESENTATION THAT TALKED ABOUT THEIR IMPROVEMENT IN REDUCTION IN INCIDENT RATES AFTER THEY IMPLEMENTED SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM IN SAFETY CULTURE. REQUIREMENTS IN CONTRA COSTA COUNTY IT'S PRETTY COMPELLING. IT WAS VERY PLEASED TO HAVE THAT PRESENTATION BROUGHT FORWARD ALSO WE HAD A A REGULATOR FROM NATIONAL ENERGY BOARD WHO ALSO IS A SAFETY CULTURE EXPERT. WHO -- WHO DID A DISSERTATION ON THE IMPACT OF SAFETY CULTURE ON THE OUT PERFORMANCE OF THOSE? THE REGULATORS SAFETY CULTURE I'M THE OUT ON THE OUTCOME OF PERFORMANCE OF THE OF THE UTILITIES AT THE REGULATOR REGULATES SO THESE ARE VERY. CORE ISSUES WE BELIEVE IN INTO FILLING OUR MANDATE. AND SO I WANTED TO JUST HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE OF THOSE THINGS FROM OUR PRESENTATION. FROM FROM OUR OUR REPORT. SO -- ALSO JUST TO MAKE YOU AWARE WE WE HAVE SO WE HAVE DRAFTED A SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM STANDARD. WHICH WE ARE WE WHICH WE ARE SOCIALIZING IN TERMS OF BRINGING IT TOWARDS FOR THE COMMISSION TO BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT IT AS A REQUIREMENT. FOR UTILITIES I'M ALSO -- AS PART OF THAT WE HAVE PHASES IN THAT IN IN THAT PROPOSED PROPOSAL FOR THE COMMISSION ONE ALSO INCLUDES A SAFETY REPORTING SYSTEM. I'M AND ALSO LOOKING AT WHAT CAN BE DONE IN TERMS OF SAFETY CULTURE WHAT WE CAN LEARN FROM FOR EXAMPLE WHAT'S BEEN DONE IN CONTRA COSTA WHERE THEY ACTUALLY HAVE THE SAFETY CULTURE REQUIREMENTS. I'M IN SO WE HOPE TO HAVE THAT. BEFORE AN AGENDA ON THE COMMISSION IN THE NEAR TERM. AND ACTUALLY IN JUNE OF NEXT MONTH WE HAVE BROUGHT IN A A TRAINER. WHO IS GOING TO DO SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM TRAIN? THAT WE ARE THAT WE ARE GOING TO VIDEO CONFERENCE WITH ALL OF OUR SITES AND INVITE. FOLKS FROM ALL OVER THE COMMISSION TO OBTAIN IT'S NOT ABOUT SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM OR THE REGULATOR BUT IT IS ABOUT SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. HOW THOSE ARE IMPLEMENTED FOR UTILITIES AND WE BELIEVE THAT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR ALL STAFF TO KIND OF GET EXPOSURE TO THIS? AND ALSO FOR OWN BENEFIT TO LEARN FROM THIS -- TRAINING OURSELVES. FROM FROM EXPERTISE THAT'S OUT THERE. AND TO SOCIALIZE IT SO THAT MORE FOLKS CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT A SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AND A SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM STANDARD IS AND HOW THEY'RE USED AND WHAT ARE THE ELEMENTS OF THAT. SO I WANTED -- TO HIGHLIGHT THAT AND THEN ALSO -- WE ALSO MAKE USE OF THE SAFETY FLAG SYSTEM THAT THE COMMISSION HAS. SOMETIMES A PROCEEDINGS HAVE HAVE VERY RIGID TIME LINES AND SO WHEN WE GOT STARTED THERE WAS A UTILITY PROCEEDING GOING ON IN WHICH WE THE TRAIN HAD LEFT THE STATION. BUT WE HAD SOME CONCERNS IN THAT SAFETY. IN THAT IN THAT UTILITIES. RISK SOME OF ITS REST IN THAT AND SO WHAT WE DID IS. WHAT WE DID IS WE SUBMITTED A SAFETY FLAG IT WAS JUST NOT FEASIBLE FOR US TO GET INVOLVED IN THE PRECEDING THAT THAT TIME AND? OF THE PRECEDING IN TERMS OF HOW IT WAS UNFOLDING SO WE SUBMITTED A SAFETY FLAG SO THAT IT COULD BE FOLLOWED UP AND THEN. IT ACTUALLY HAD TO DO WITH CONCERNS WE HAD ABOUT. A HIGH RISK WHICH WOULD BE LIKE A LARGE OIL FIELD TRANSFORMER THAT IS IN HIGH RISE BUILDINGS I'M NOT SO ANYWAY JUST WANTED. TO GIVE YOU THAT JUST KINDA LIKE HIGHLIGHTS. AND THEN -- AND THEN ASKED -- INTENT ASK A RESPOND TO YOUR QUESTIONS OR IF ANYTHING AYE AYE SAID PROMPTED ANYTHING I YEAH YOU KNOW ACTUALLY IT IT DID A COUPLE OF THINGS AND AND NO BARS. TAKING NOTES HERE AS WELL THE OF WE TALK ABOUT THE AND I DO HAVE SOME. REGULAR QUESTIONS THAT I CAN PUT TOGETHER BUT THE A SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AS HOW HOW IS THE HOW IS HAVE HAS BEEN RECEIVED. IN TERMS OF YOUR APPROACH TO TRY AND GET THE UTILITIES LOOK AT THAT AND THEN WE ALSO LOOK AT HOW THE REGULATOR WOULD BE. INVOLVED IN THAT PROCESS AT SOME POINT. SO WE HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN IN SEVERAL PROCEEDINGS AS WELL WE'RE WE TOUCH UPON SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. IMPLEMENTATION AT A UTILITY I'M ONE THING THAT WE LEARNED AT THE SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM ON BOND FROM -- ONE OF THE SPEAKERS IS THAT A SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. IT'S NOT JUST HAVING A SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM IT'S HOW YOU IMPLEMENTED SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. THAT WAS ONE OF THE KEY POINTS AND ACTUALLY SAFETY CULTURE WITH AN OPERATOR CAN HAVE A BIG IMPACT ON THAT IN FACT JUST RECENTLY TALKING WITH THIS. WE STAY IN TOUCH WITH MOST OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE PART OF THAT SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM ON BOB. WE BELIEVE IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO STAY ENGAGED WITH THEM AND AND IN JUST A ANA DOLE STORY WAS. THAT THEIR EXPERIENCE GOING OUT TO AN OPERATOR WHERE THEY BELIEVE THE SAFETY CULTURE WAS FOUR COMPARED TO ONE WHERE THEY BELIEVE THE SAFETY CULTURE ACTION SAFE OR JUST NOT AS GOOD. AS ANOTHER ONE AND AND SO. THEY SHOULD THEY THEY GAVE AN EXAMPLE OF WHERE -- LIKE FOR EXAMPLE WHEN YOU HAVE ON RELIEF. HIGH PRESSURE RELIEF VALVES ARE BEING LOOKED AT HOW ONE WHEN UTILITY MAY OPERATE DIFFERENT THAN ANOTHER. I'M SO IT'S IT WAS THE MESSAGE THE MESSAGE I TOOK AWAY FROM THAT IS THE SAFETY CULTURE. OF AN OPERATOR IS VERY IMPORTANT AND HOW WELL A SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM ACTUALLY GETS TO ACTIVELY IMPLEMENTED. SO -- SO IN IN SOCIALIZING THIS SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM CONCEPT I THINK THAT ONE OF THE KEY THINGS WILL BE THE SAFETY CULTURE WILL BE CORD TO HOW IT HOW IT GETS. SO IN SOME CASES A UTILITY MAY COME BACK AND SAY OH WE HAVE A SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. BUT IT'S NOT JUST HAVING A SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM IT'S HOW IT'S IMPLEMENTED -- I DON'T KNOW IF I GOT THERE YOU KNOW I DID THAT THAT'S VERY TRUE AND THANK YOU FOR THAT THE THE YOU KNOW IF YOU. THE THE REPORT THAT WE PUT TOGETHER FOR THE HEARING TODAY IF THE IT RAISES SOME CRITIQUES THAT THE I THINK. CRITICISMS OF OF THE SYSTEM TODAY BUT I AT YOU DON'T WANNA CLARIFY THOSE ARE MORE PROCESS PRETTY TO ME THAT SHE'S BEEN THE CHALLENGES THAT I THINK YOU'RE FACING. IN THE LARGER ECHO THE CONCERNS THAT WE RAISED DURING THE SUBCOMMITTEE HEARING WE HAD IN. OF ON SAFETY INTERVENOR IS IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WHERE WE DISCUSS SOME OF THESE ISSUES WILL BE QUESTIONED. QUESTION REALLY WHETHER THE CQC WAS SETTING UP THE NEW OFFICE FAILURE OF THAT IT WAS. THERE WERE OPPORTUNITIES THERE BUT YOU KNOW IS IT GOING TO WORK AT THE END OF THE DAY IN AND IT WORKED. I AND I DON'T THINK YOU FAILED AT ALL SO I DON'T WANT TO GIVE THAT IMPRESSION I THINK YOU'VE OPERATED. FOR TWO YEARS WITH A SMALL STAFF OF ENCOURAGING TO SEE TE NUMBERS THAT YOU HAVE. NOW THAT I THINK MADE ME WORK A LITTLE BETTER BUT OF IT'S HARD TO SUCCEED SOMETIMES IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES. I AND I AND I REALLY WANT WANT TO SEE. SEE THE EIGHT YOU KNOW THE ESSAYS TO SUCCEED IN YOUR ANNUAL REPORT YOU KNOW THE NUMBER OF THE PROCEEDINGS THAT OSA IS ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN AND HOW DOES YOUR OFFICE PRIORITIZE WHICH PROCEEDINGS TO BECOME ENGAGED WITH A TO BE. A PARTY [inaudible] TO SO -- WE LOOK AT WHAT WE LOOK AT IS WE GET ON WE DO ENGAGE WITH COMMISSIONERS. AND WE WE DO LISTEN TO THEM IN TERMS OF OF OF THEIR PRIORITIES. WE ALSO LOOK AT THE STANDARD THAT WE HAVE. AND SO WE HAVE A SO WE I DESCRIBE THOSE THREE LARGE CATEGORIES THEY'RE PRETTY BROAD. AND AND ALSO BELIEVE THEY'RE VERY VERY I THINK WE ALL BELIEVE THEY'RE VERY VERY IMPORTANT. AND SO -- OF WHAT WE DO IS WE TRIED. TO RESPOND TO EACH ONE IN IN THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY WEEK. WHAT WE WITH THE RESOURCES WE HAVE? WITH AS WE GROW AND IF WE'RE ABLE -- TO BUILD OUR RESOURCES OVER TIME I THINK WE WOULD BROADEN AND DEEPEN THE DEPTH THAT WE WOULD GO INTO EACH OF THESE THREE AREAS. SO I BELIEVE THAT -- IN TERMS OF FOR EXAMPLE THAT COULD COMMISSIONS ON SAFETY CULTURE SAFETY MANAGEMENT. WE DO CONTRIBUTE FOR EXAMPLE TO LOOKING AT ARMS THIS STRATEGIC DIRECTIVE -- TO I'M AND THE COMMISSION HAS COME OUT WITH A NEW ONE A NEW REVISION IN FEBRUARY. AND I SAY WILL JOIN WITH THE S. C. D. ON THURSDAY COMMISSIONER COMMITTEE THAT WILL BE JUST -- SCHEDULED TO DISCUSS STRATEGIC DIRECTIVE ODE. TO I'M ON AT THE END OF THIS MONTH. AND SO WE WILL [inaudible] PARTICIPATE. THIS COMMISSION SAFETY CULTURE SAFETY MANAGEMENT. WE DO WISH TO DEVOTE MORE RESOURCES AND TIME TOWARDS LOADING. IF WE ASK UTILITIES TO DO A SAFETY CULTURE ASSESSMENT. WHAT CAN WE DO AS A COMMISSION O DO OUR OWN SAFETY CULTURE ASSESSMENT AND TO LOOK AT OUR OWN SELVES IN TERMS OF OUR OWN SAFETY MANAGEMENT? I BELIEVE THAT WE YOU KNOW THE COMMISSION IS CONTINUING TO DEVELOP ITS STRATEGIC DIRECTOR -- IN IN SAFETY AND WE WISH TO BE PART OF THAT AND AS WE GROWING GET MORE RESOURCES I BELIEVE. WE WE WILL BE ABLE TO CONTRIBUTE MORE IN THAT AREA I BELIEVE WE DO WANT TO CONTRIBUTE MORE IN THAT AREA. I ALSO BELIEVE IN PROCEEDINGS. WE WE CANNOT TAKE ON THE THE LARGE DAMAGE OF PROGRAMS ARE IN A PROCEEDING FOR EXAMPLE A RATE CASE SO AS I DESCRIBED THAT ONE CASE WHERE THERE WAS A I FIND FAILURE. WE LOOK AT THIS ONE SPECIFIC ELEMENT WHICH TALKED ABOUT HOW THEY DO THIS MECHANISM FOR PROJECTS SUBSTITUTION. AND WE KEYED IN ON THAT AND MADE A RECOMMENDATION SO THAT'S HOW WE GOT INVOLVED IN THAT PROCEEDINGS WHO ARE YOUR IS YOUR PRIVATIZATION BASED ON THE THE THE IN YOUR ENGAGEMENT PROPORTIONAL TO THE STAFF THAT YOU HAVE BEEN TO THE LIMITATIONS THAT YOU HAVE WITHIN -- ESSAY. YES YES IT IS IT IS YOU DO MORE IF YOU HAD THAT OPPORTUNITY. ABSOLUTELY YOU SEE A GREATER NEED FOR MORE YES WE SEE A GREAT I I SEE A GREATER NEED FOR MORE ABSOLUTELY US -- THE THE OTHER OTHER FACTORS BESIDES STAFF THAT WOULD PRECLUDE YOU FROM DOING MORE OR THE ABILITY AND THE OTHER RESOURCES THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE OTHER OTHER THINGS THAT COULD IMPEDE YOU FROM. I'M DOING MORE WITH WOULD. HAVE TO HAPPEN. TO ENCOURAGE MORE ACTIVITY OR IS THERE ANYTHING THAT. IT WOULD OTHER THAN RESOURCE I'M. I BELIEVE THAT -- I BELIEVE THAT THE I I BELIEVE THAT. YOU KNOW WE'RE WHERE ONE DIVISION AS PART OF A LARGE COMMISSION. AND I BELIEVE THAT THE COMMISSION. AS IT AS A WHOLE COULD BENEFIT FROM GREATER RESOURCES BECAUSE EVEN AS WE ARRANGE FOR EXAMPLE THIS TRAINING COMING UP IN JUNE. I MEAN THERE ARE THERE ARE RESOURCES THAT COULD BENEFIT LIKE YOU KNOW THAT TAKES GETTING% A CONTRACT. THERE'S A LOT OF ELEMENTS THAT THE COMMISSION HAS WHICH IS I THINK COULD BENEFIT FROM GREATER RESOURCES. AND I'LL JUST. REFERENCE THERE WAS A THERE WAS A RADIO PROGRAM ON IN IN SAN FRANCISCO IN JANUARY WHERE THEY BROUGHT TOGETHER DOCTOR BORN STEEN. FORMER COMMISSIONER WITH SAND OF ALL IN A IN A IN A LOCAL SUPERVISOR FROM SAN FRANCISCO AND THE MESSAGE THAT IT WOULD AYE AYE PERSON CLOSER ABOUT LIKE THIS COMMISSION. IS MASSIVELY UNDER RESOURCE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. I I DO BELIEVE THAT NOT ONLY COULD -- ESSAY BUT I BELIEVE THE WHOLE COMMISSION COULD REALLY BENEFIT FROM HAVING A LOT MORE RESOURCES GIVEN THE I WOULD AGREE I THINK YOU'RE YOU'RE. YOU'RE OUT GUNS IS OPPORTUNITY THIS STUFF THERE. YOU KNOW FOR THIS THOSE PROCEEDINGS THAT YOU DON'T. DID YOU HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO BECAUSE A RESOURCES ADVOCATE FOR BE PARTICIPATING IN. HOW DO THE COMMISSIONERS OR THE L. JAY'S RECEIVE ANY SAFETY INFORMATION RELATED TO THE ISSUES THAT THEY'RE DEALING WITH IS THAT? NOW GO ON MENTIONED AROUND DISCUSSED. SO I I THINK. I THINK THEY'RE VERY. VERY -- CONCERNED ABOUT SAFETY -- I THINK THAT I'M. IT'S IT'S TIME. I I THINK A AND WE'RE PLEASE FOR EXAMPLE LIKE. YOU KNOW IN SOME OF THE PRECEDING SOME OF THE THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE'VE MADE HAVE BEEN ADOPTED AND IMPLEMENTED INTO DECISIONS WHERE. WE'RE VERY PLEASED ABOUT THAT I'M AND AND SOME OF THE PROCEEDINGS THEY THEY REMAIN TO BE SEEN BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF PROCEEDINGS AT SUCH A TIME WHAT'S LONG TIME LINE. WE'RE ONE VOICE WE WE DEFINITELY HAVE OUR POSITION AND A AND WHAT WE BELIEVE IS. IS BEST BUT I KNOW THAT ANY DECISION MAKERS GOING TO HAVE TO WAY. YOU KNOW INPUT FROM FROM ALL PARTIES BUT I AM I I DO BELIEVE THAT THERE IS -- THERE IS INTEREST YOU KNOW THERE'S THERE'S A GREAT DEAL OF INTEREST ON SAFETY I THINK A LOT OF P. A LOT OF DIFFERENT. NO MATTER WHAT VENUE WHERE WE'RE TALKING AND I THINK THAT EVERYONE HAS HAS. HAS PRIORITIES IN TERMS OF WHERE CAN WE BE MOST EFFECTIVE AND SO WE FEEL LIKE WE GET THE BEST. I FEEL LIKE WE DO OUR BEST WHEN WE TAKE THE INPUT FROM THE MOST. FROM THE MOST PEOPLE SO THAT WE GET WHERE WE'RE NOT JUST. OPERATING IN A VACUUM WE WE ANNEX WE ENGAGE WITH THE WITH THE OTHER SAFETY STAFF AT THE COMMISSION WE GO OUT AND REACH OUT TO COMMISSIONERS. TO MEET WITH THEM AND AND THEN WE MEET WITH. SOME EXIT THESE OUTSIDE EXPERTS AND AND ASK THEM FOR THEIR INPUT SO THAT WE CAN. PRODUCE THE BEST GIVEN THE BEST INFORMATION THAT WE CAN OF PAINT. IN THAT IS HELPFUL IN. IF YOU KNOW THE JUST THE SUBCOMMITTEE HAS BEEN VERY MUCH INTERESTED IN SAFETY MANAGEMENT AND AND AS YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT IN MENTIONED EARLIER AT THE CPUC. AS IN ALL THE UTILITIES HOW HOW HAS IN HAVE. YOU MENTIONED SOME OF THE THE FOUR PILLARS OF THE SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS AND HOW HAS THE OF DOES IT BEEN INCORPORATED AT ALL IN THE CPUC SAFETY POLICIES THAT THEY HAVE. THERE BEEN ANY. ANY WORK IN IN THAT AND AND I ENJOYED READING THROUGH THOSE IN THE THE PACKETS OF INFORMATION WAS PROVIDED AT THE END OF THE THOSE. THE SPORT COLORS OF A SAFETY MANAGEMENT SMS AS HAS IT BEEN. AND YOU MENTIONED THAT IT'S BEEN WORKING WITH UTILITIES. MAYBE NOT AS MUCH WITH THE UC ITSELF. HAS THERE BEEN SOME EFFORTS IN THAT REGARD. YEAH SO I'M IN THE MOST RECENT STRATEGIC DIRECTIVE THAT THAT THE COMMISSIONERS ADOPTED IN THEIR COMMISSIONER COMMITTEE MEANS. THEY'VE THEY'VE [inaudible] THEY'VE. STEVE HIGHLIGHTED I'M. THE FOR KIND OF REORGANIZE ST STRATEGIC DIRECTIVE OF TWO I'M AND AND SO NOW IT IT. IS BROKEN DOWN INTO. OBJECTIVES FOR THE UTILITIES AND OBJECTIVES FOR THE COMMISSION IS VERY IS VERY BRIEF IT'S VERY SHORT ANSWER LIKE THE OVERARCHING VISION IS HOW I WOULD INTERPRET IT. I'M AND I THINK THAT ON I THINK THAT THERE'S OPPORTUNITIES. TO FOR AN AND THEY I THINK THE STRATEGIC DIRECTORS ARE ARE THE STRATEGIC DIRECTORS FOR STAFF SO WHEN WE GO BEFORE THE COMMISSIONERS AT THE END OF THE MONTH. THEY'RE GOING TO BE ASKING US WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO IMPLEMENT OUR STRATEGIC DIRECTORS AND THEY'RE GONNA ASK US METRICS ON HOW WE'RE SHOWING THAT WE ARE. ACCOMPLISHING WHAT THEY'RE WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR SO I BELIEVE THAT'S THE COMMISSIONERS LOOKING TO STAFF INCLUDING -- ESSAY WILL BE PART OF THE ESPY -- TO I'M AND AND THEY'LL THEY'LL THEY'LL BE I IMAGINE THEY'LL BE TOUGH HONEST TO OUR OWN ROLE I THINK THAT IS THAT. WE HAVEN'T MEASURED UP TO WHERE I THINK WE NEED TO BE YOU KNOW FROM FROM OUR OWN LITTLE. AND I THINK THAT. THEY WOULD PROBABLY WILL PROBABLY ASK US TO DO MORE. AND SO. AND I THINK THAT THE BROAD VISION IS IS IN THE STRATEGIC DIRECTIVE I THINK THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO DRILL DOWN INTO THAT AND TO BRING IT DOWN IT'S A MORE. PHYSICAL CONCRETE SORT OF LIKE MECHANISMS AND PROGRAMS THAT THE COMMISSION AND THEN. FURTHER CONTINUOUSLY IMPROVE SO I THINK THAT IN FACT IN RESPONSE TO THIS BILL -- SB ONE NINETY NINE FIRST TIME I REALLY EVER SAT DOWN WITH THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR. WE HAD A GREAT CONVERSATION. BECAUSE I THINK THAT THAT YOU KNOW THAT'S WHERE WE CAN THEN DO FOLLOW UP SO IF THEY'RE THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES -- TO IDENTIFIED FOR IMPROVEMENT IN THE COMMISSION'S OWN SAFETY MANAGEMENT SAFETY CULTURE. I THINK THAT IN WORKING WITH THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR. THAT LEVERAGES ANOTHER RESOURCE -- TO KIND OF CLOSE THE LOOP ON THINGS SO AND THINGS COME UP AND THEY CAN THEN BE. ADDRESSED -- IN A METHODICAL WAY. YOU MENTIONED SAFETY MANAGEMENT STANDARD CHILDREN IN THE TRUCK ARE YOU REFERRING TO WHAT DO YOU ACTUALLY MEAN BY THAT IS THAT THE SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS OF THE FOR COLORS THE WE TALKED ABOUT OTHER EXAMPLES OF THAT. AND HOW WOULD APPLY TO THE CPU TODAY SURE SO FOR EXAMPLE FAA USES FOR LIKE THAT FOUR PILLAR APPROACH IN IN THEIR BROAD ON REQUIREMENTS. AND THEN IN IN THE GAS PIPELINE ONE FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S SOMETHING LIKE TEN ELEMENTS I THINK AND THEY BREAK IT DOWN INTO A LEADERSHIP STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT. MANAGEMENT OF CHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT OPERATIONAL CONTROLS THAT SORT OF THING. AS AS A BACKGROUND FROM AN ENGINEER. I I I GET MORE BENEFIT OUT OF HAVING THINGS MORE CONCRETE MORE SORT OF LIKE BROKEN DOWN SO I THINK THAT. FOR UTILITIES IN PARTICULAR WITH THAT A GAS PIPELINE STANDARD THERE'S A LOT OF VALUE IN HAVING IT BROKEN DOWN TO THE ELEMENTS AND THEN SOME I CAN GO IN AND ASSESS EACH ELEMENT. I DON'TTHINK WE NECESSARILY BROKE IN OUR OWN SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM DOWN TO THAT ELEMENT. I THINK THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WE CAN DO AND THAT WE CAN ALWAYS SAY CAN. OR THE AND THE COMMISSION. CAN CAN GET FURTHER BENEFIT BY DRILLING DOWN AND BRINGING THAT DOWN INTO A DEEPER LEVEL OF ELEMENTS THAT WAY YOU CAN LOOK AT THE ELEMENT. AND ASSESS THAT ELEMENT THE PILLAR IS A LITTLE HARDER A LITTLE MORE DIFFICULT WELL ARE WE DO WE REALLY HAVE THAT KILLER IN PLACE BUT IF WE TALK ABOUT LIKE. WHAT'S OUR STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT WATER OUR PROGRAMS AND PROCESSES TO DO THAT HOW IT WENT HOW DO WE FOSTER SPEAK UP. CULTURE HOW ARE WE ASSESS SCENE IF WE HAVE THAT -- AND THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT. WE WE IT WILL CTUALLY BE PART OF THE SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM TRAINING MAKE IT DOWN INTO HOW YOU IMPLEMENT THESE THANKS NOW THAT'S FOR UTILITY. BUT I I THINK THEY'RE VERY. THE THE I THINK IT CROSSES OVER TO REGULATED THERE'S GONNA BE A CORRESPONDING SORT OF ELEMENT THAT WOULD BE PART OF A SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. OKAY A I UNDERSTAND THE OF YOU ALSO MENTIONED THE SAFETY FLAG PROGRAM THAT THAT YOU HAVE IN THE SYSTEM HI I THOUGHT WHAT'S WHAT'S THE ORDER OF OPERATIONS HOW DOES THAT. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU? USE THAT PARTICULAR PROCESS AND PROCEDURE OF A SAFETY FLAG. SO I'M JUST HIS FINGERS REALLY QUICK THE SAFETY FLAG IS IS IS INTENDED. FOR BRING FORWARD ISSUES THAT ARE CONCERNED ABOUT UTILITY SOME SOME PEOPLE CONFUSE THEM WITH A WHISTLE BLOWER WHICH MIGHT BE IN A UTILITY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT OR FOLKS MIGHT. CONFUSE IT WITH SOME OTHER SAFETY REPORTING THAT COMES INTO THE COMMISSION'S WEBSITE BUT THE SAFETY FLAG AS PRIMARILY AND IT'S ALSO NOT SOMETHING LIKE IF THERE'S AN ISSUE THAT. EMPLOYER BUILDING WHICH I NORMALLY GOES TO A SEPARATE GROUP AT THE COMMISSION THAT HAS TO DO WITH ISSUES WITH THE BUILDING OR SOME KIND A HAZARD WITH THE ROOM OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. BUT THE SAFETY FLAG IS INTENDED TO BE FOR UTILITIES AND IT CAN COME FROM ANYWHERE CAN COME FROM BUT IN PARTICULAR A STAFF FIND SOMETHING THAT'S OF A CONCERN. THEY CAN RAISE IT TO BE ADDRESSED ON WE'VE MADE USE OF IT LIKE I MENTIONED FOR THE ON TRANSFORMERS THAT WE SAW BEING ADDRESSED AS A HIGH RISK ASK EXPEDITED ISSUE WITH ONE UTILITY. BUT WE DIDN'T SEE IT IN ANOTHER UTILITIES -- GENERATE CASE APPLICATION HOW DO YOU FOLLOW UP WITH THOSE FLAG SO. RIGHT NOW WE DON'T HAVE I WOULD SAY WHEAT THAT'S SOMETHING WHERE. IT IS NOW BEING RE IS NOW BEING REVISED AND SO  THINK THAT THAT'S AN OPPORTUNITY WHERE WE CAN DO A GREATER FOLLOW UP BECAUSE I THINK THAT OUR OUR TIME LAG ON RESPONDING TO THOSE IS IS NOT WHERE IT SHOULD BE. AND HOW WOULD INFLUENCE OF PROCEEDING. THE WHOLE THE ENTIRE FLAG SYSTEM. SO A FIFTY FLAG DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE EMPLOYMENT TO PROCEEDING ALTHOUGH I COULD BUT IF A SAFETY FLAG. RAISED AN ISSUE FOR EXAMPLE LIKE IN OUR CASE WITH THE YOU KNOW CONCERNED ABOUT A HIGH RISK WITH THE LARGE AWFUL TRANCE FROM HIGH RISE BUILDING. IT COULD BE A PIECE OF INFORMATION THAT WE WOULD CERTAINLY USE IF WE THEN WE'RE IN A PROCEEDING WHERE WE COULD. ASK OKAY WHAT IT WHAT IS THIS UTILITY DOING ABOUT IN THE SAFETY FLAG WE INITIATED IT HAD TO DO WITH THE SPECIFIC. UTILITY WHERE WE WE COULDN'T GET INTO THE RATE CASE AT THAT TIME -- IT COULD ALSO BE USED IF THERE'S AN ISSUE IT COULD BE LOOKED AT IS THIS A BROAD PROBLEM ACROSS MULTIPLE UTILITIES SHOULD WE ADDRESS THIS IN A RULE MAKING. SHOULD WE SHOULD WE REACH OUT AND SEE WHETHER WE NEED TO ADDRESS IS -- IN BEYOND FOR EXAMPLE HOW IS FIRST -- BROUGHT TO THE ATTENTION OF THE COMMISSION SO I THINK IT CAN BE USED IN A PROCEEDING AND IT'S ALSO S. ACTUALLY IT'S ONE OF THE METRICS NOW. THAT THE COMMISSION HAS DONE IN ITS NEW STRATEGIC DIRECTIVE -- TO WHERE THEY WANT TO GET. INFORMATION ON BOTH THE INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL USE OF THE SAFETY FLAG SO THEY WANT THE COMMISSION IS LOOKING NOW TO GET MORE INFORMATION ON THAT BROUGHT FOR TO THE COMMISSIONERS. SO YOU FIND IT SUCCESSFUL THE AT THIS POINT THAT I I I BELIEVE THAT WE'VE BROUGHT SOME SOME ISSUES FORWARD I BELIEVE THAT. IT CAN BE CONTINUOUSLY IMPROVE BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S LOTS OF OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE IT. IN THE PAST WE'VE HEARD FROM THE SAME VIEWS THE STAFF THAT. THAT NO ONE SHOULD KNOW AS MUCH ABOUT THE ABOUT UTILITY EQUIPMENT OPERATION AS THE UTILITY OPERATORS THEMSELVES AND NO. ONE COULD KNOW AS MUCH -- IS THEY KNOW. YOU SHARE THAT VIEW POINT I'M [inaudible] SO -- A COUPLE FIGHTS ARE I I BELIEVE UTILITIES OFTEN ARE ARE THE EXPERTS IN CERTAIN AREAS AND AND AND AND AND AND IN MANY AREAS AND AND AND SO. I BELIEVE A SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR UTILITIES KINDA LEVERAGES THAT BECAUSE IT'S IT'S A SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM REQUIRE FOR THE UTILITIES THE NOW THE UTILITY IN ORDER TO IMPLEMENT A SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. THEY HAVE TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE THE EXPERTISE THEY HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE ADDRESSING ALL THESE ISSUES. SO RATHER THAN HAVING US GO OUT AND FIFTY MANAGE FOR THE UTILITY THE SAFETY YOU TO THE UTILITY WILL DEVELOP A SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE COMMISSION IN SOME FORM TO ASSESS. THAT SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM SO WE CAN ASSESS IT. EVEN IF WE WERE LIKE NATIONAL ENERGY BOARD OF CANADA WE CAN CONDUCT AUDITS ON IT WE CAN LOOK FOR GAPS WE CAN'T BE RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING SURE THAT. THEY'RE THERE IS EVERY PROCEDURE AND PROCESS FOLLOWED BUT WE CAN LOOK TO SEE HOW IS THIS BEING FOLLOWED BROADLY IS IS UTILITY DOING IT SO I BELIEVE THAT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE UTILITY DID TO DO IT. ALSO I BELIEVE THE COMMISSION PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE BECAUSE WE CAN FIND GAPS I MEAN WE GET TO SEE LOTS OF UTILITIES WE SEE A UTILITY HAS SOME PROGRAM. ANOTHER UTILITY DOESN'T IS THAT BECAUSE I'M PORTANT SAFETY PROGRAM IS THAT BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THAT PROBLEM WHERE THEY DON'T HAVE THAT RISK. CAN WE IDENTIFY IT AND THEN SHARE THAT INFORMATION WITH UTILITY AND THEN HAVE THEM NOT HAVE TO GO THROUGH A LEARNING A LESSON ABOUT THIS DO YOU THINK THAT THAT -- YOU KNOW THE THE IDEA OF THE UTILITY. IN THE NO ONE KNOWS THAT BETTER THAN THEY KNOW IT AND WHICH IS FINE TO DOES THAT EVER LEAVE WITH PEOPLE OR THE THE UC EMPLOYEES FEELING ON QUALIFIED TO DO THE JOB OR THAT YOU HAVE TO RELY ON THEIR ACTIONS -- YOU MENTION THE TO AND YOU COME BACK AND GET A REASSESS WHAT THEY'RE DOING TO EVALUATE WHAT THEY'RE DOING. YOU FEEL QUALIFIED TO DO THAT -- BASED ON THE THE CONCEPT OF THINKING THAT THEY ARE NO ONE KNOWS IT BETTER THAN THEY DO ARE KNOWN AS MUCH INFORMATION ABOUT IT DIDN'T AND THEN THE OPERATORS. I'D LIKE TO COME TO THAT. ONE WAS THAT YES. SO ON I THINK FOR THE CONFUSION MIGHT BE IS THAT YOU KNOW OF IN SOME REGARDS YES. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TELL AHEAD OPERATOR HOT OPERATIONS SYSTEM. EVERY SYSTEM OUT THERE IS CUSTOMIZED BUT WE DEFINITELY HAVE THE EXPERTISE TO SAY OKAY TELL ME ABOUT YOUR STATUS SYSTEM YOU KNOW THIS CASE SYSTEM IS. SO TELL ME HOW IT'S DESIGNED TELL ME HOW IT OPERATES TELL ME IF YOU HAVE CIRCUITS OVER HERE THAT YOU CAN SHUT DOWN REMOTELY. SO YES DEFINITELY WE ARE OVERSEEING WHAT THEY'RE DOING HOW THEY'RE OPERATING IS THERE SYSTEM VERY OLD I MEAN IS THE ARE THEY USING. THREE PHASE CIRCUITS THAT ARE GROUNDED THAT ARE VERY UNSTABLE I MEAN THAT'S A BIG CONCERN WE KNOW ABOUT THAT NO WE CAN QUESTION THEM ABOUT THAT. IN THE POWER INDUSTRY IS VERY OLD I MEAN THE TECHNOLOGY IS VERY VERY OLD SO THERE DEFINITELY NEEDS TO BE UPGRADES SO THEY NEED SOMEBODY LIKE US TO PUSH HIM. TO MAKE THE SYSTEM SAFER THE IDEA RELIABLE THAT YOU YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND THEIR SYSTEM AS WELL AS THEY DO BUT YOU CAN COME IN WITH A CRITICAL EYE AND AND AND MAKE. IT CAN UNDERSTAND HOW IT WORKS HOW IT'S SUPPOSED TO WORK. WELL LET ME CLARIFY THAT SO FOR INSTANCE IF THERE THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF D. ENERGIES ASIAN THIS NEXT YEAR THERE'SGOING TO BE A LOT OF BLACKOUT PERIODS DURING THE WINDY SEASON IN THE FALL -- TO COME IN AND TELL THEM HOW TO HOW TO ACTUALLY MANUALLY SHUT DOWN THOSE CIRCUITS I DON'T THINK WE GET DOWN INTO THE NUTS AND BOLTS OF THAT THEY KNOW THEIR SYSTEM. HOW TO BRING THE ENERGY BACK UP I DON'T KNOW IF THE COMMISSION IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO TELL THEM EXACTLY WHAT SWITCHES TO THROW AND ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF? BUT ON THE THIRTY THOUSAND FOOT VIEW LEVEL. HOW YOU YOU KNOW HOW OLD IS YOUR SYSTEM AND HOW ARE YOU MANAGING IT ABSOLUTELY WE HAVE THAT EXPERTISE SO WE NEED TO PUSH IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION? TO MAKE IT SAFER. LET'S IS VERY GOOD FOR THE IT MAKES GOOD SENSE I MEAN I THINK THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOUR ROLE AND THAT'S WHAT YOU SHOULD BE DOING TO THAT LOOK AT IT IN THAT -- IN ADVANCE OF THE HAVE YOU. IS THE OFFICE COULD KIND OF GONE OUT OF ITS WAY. TO EDUCATE THE COMMISSION ITSELF OF COMMISSIONERS ON ON A SOME OF THE VIEWS THAT YOU HAVE ON SAFETY ISSUES AND I'M TRYING. TO TRYING TO TO TO BRING. THE FEW SEE TO A LEVEL OF OF SAFETY COMPETENCE THAT THEY MAY NOT HAVE HAD BEFORE. ON SO -- SO. WE HAVE ON OUR HI FOR EXAMPLE WE HAD THETHE SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM ON BONK. ON AND AND IN THAT WAY WE BROUGHT IN EXPERTS TO KINDA EDUCATE THEM ON THAT NGUYEN WHERE PROCEEDINGS. CERTAINLY WE WE HAVE TO MAKE A CASE FOR WHY WE THINK THE COMMISSION SHOULD -- SHOULD -- EXCEPT -- ESSAYS RECOMMENDATION AND THEN WHEN WE ARE OUTSIDE OF PROCEEDINGS -- WHEN WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO MEET WITH THE COMMISSIONERS -- THEN WE CAN FOR EXAMPLE YOU KNOW WITH THE SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM -- PROPOSAL THAT WE WISH TO BRING FOR THEM WE CAN EDUCATE THEM ABOUT OF WHY THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S WORTH DOING -- WE DO HAVE -- YOU KNOW WHAT WE WERE IN WITH MORE SELF WE GET THE MARS COMMISSIONERS ARE REALLY BUSY ONE THING I GOT TO MENTION IS THAT WHEN WE HAVE THE SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM ON BOND. A COUPLE OF THE SPEAKERS WHO SPOKE BEFORE THE COMMISSIONERS. I TOLD ME AFTERWARDS HOW IMPRESSED THEY WERE ACTUALLY ABOUT THE THE LEVEL OF QUESTIONS THAT THEY RECEIVE FROM THE COMMISSIONERS THEY ACTUALLY THOUGHT THAT. IT COMPARED TO I GUESS OR EXPERIENCE MAY BE ANOTHER REGULATORY ONES THAT THEY THOUGHT THAT THEY HAD SOME REALLY. IN NOW TARGET IN AND AND AND KNOWLEDGEABLE QUESTIONS THAT THEY WERE ASKED FROM THE COMMISSIONERS. SO -- THEY ARE IN SOME WAYS THEY SEE. MAYBE MORE WITH AND WE SEE BECAUSE WE JUST DON'T HAVE THE TIME TO GO TO ALL OF THE COMMISSION OR COMMITTEE MEETINGS AND ALL THE COMMISSIONER -- MEETINGS THAT THEY GO -- TO AND AND I THINK AS WE GROW AND AS WE KIND OF ESTABLISH OURSELVES -- TO TO TO BE ABLE TO BRING FORWARD MORE SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS I THINK THE VALUE IT I'VE AT LEAST HEARD. A COUPLE OF TIMES FOR I THINK THEY WOULD LIKE MORE OF ARE IN PLACE AND WE I THINK WE WOULD. WE WOULD. THAT'S KIND OF ON US TO BE ABLE TO BE ABLE TO CARVE THAT OUT TO PROVIDE MORE OF THAT INPUT. GOOD TO ADD ON TO THAT THE TRAIN THAT CHRIS MENTIONED THAT'S GONNA TAKE PLACE IN JUNE. THAT'S FOR NOT JUST -- SAY BUT OTHER GROUPS WITHIN THE COMMISSION. SO WE'RE GONNA WERE INVITING WE'RE GOING TO DO IT AND THREE DIFFERENT LOCATIONS WERE INVITING A LOT OF PEOPLE AND WE'RE GOING TO WE'RE GOING TO TAPE IT. THE THE CHALLENGES IS TRUE TO EDUCATE THE ENTIRE STAFF NOT JUST SO SAY WHAT IS AN ASSET. WHAT HOW DOES IT FUNCTION WHAT IS IT WHAT IS ITS BENEFITS SO THAT TRAINING IN JUNE IS GOING TO BE A BIG STEP FORWARD AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE PEOPLE EVERY SINGLE OFFICE? WHO CAN HELP YOU KNOW IT'S PLAIN AND YOU KNOW ANSWER QUESTIONS AND SAY COME TO ME WHEN YOU HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT? OKAY I UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT ABOUT AN SMS IS NOW BUT I HAVE THESE QUESTIONS SO WE'RE BECOMING THE EXPERTS AND WE'RE WE'RE BRINGING IN. EXPERT TRAINER. AND WE WANT TO DO MORE CONTRACTS WITH MORE EXPERTS THE WELL THAT'S WONDERFUL I MEAN IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'VE. YOU REALLY TAKING THIS IN THE LAST TWO YEARS AND IN A MOVE THAT WITH THE DIRECTION WITH THE FOCUS AND TRYING TO EXPAND THAT WITH THE RESOURCES YOU HAVE AN TO DO AS MUCH AS YOU CAN WITH THOSE RESOURCES WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION. AND THEN IS IT'S INVOLVED WITH THE OTHER UTILITIES WITH THE UTILITIES OR DEALING WITH THANK YOU. FOR BEING HERE TODAY FINAL THOUGHT TO FEUD LIKE TO MAKE -- ONE YEP. SORRY YOU DON'T NEED. ONE YOU DON'T HAVE LOW PRECIADO THANK YOU VERY MUCH THIS WAS HELPFUL AND AND IT. IT REALLY IS IS TRYING TO IS I SEE IT. GOING TO FOCUS OUR ATTENTION ON HOW SAFETY IS THIS WORKING. IS THIS DOING MAYBE TO SOON TO TELL. OF BUT IS WE GET INTO THE NEXT TO THIS CONVERSATION THE NEXT PANEL WILL LOOK AT KIND OF THE WAY THAT FOCUS AND ATTENTION SHOULD BE AND IS IS THIS THE RIGHT PLACE FOR IT AND BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE DOING. EVERYTHING YOU CAN ADD A COUPLE OF COURSE -- WHEN THE EARLIER IN THE DISCUSSION WE WERE TALKING ABOUT RESOURCES AND STAFF AND? WE REALLY HAVE BEEN OPERATING WITH ALMOST NO ADMIN STUFF WHICH TAKES YOU KNOW WE'VE GT SENIOR ENGINEERS WERE DOING CONTRACT WORK WE'RE DOING ADMIN WORK AND THAT'S REALLY TAKING AWAY FROM. THE BATTLES WOULD BE FIGHTING. SO THAT'S THAT'S BEEN A BIG THING THIS PAST YEAR HOLDING US BACK SO WE DO HAVE ONE OTHER PERSON THAT WE'RE GONNA HIGHER BUT TO EXPAND. AND HAVE THE SAME KIND OF SUPPORT THAT OTHER GROUPS IN THE COMMISSION YOU KNOW THAT THEY HAVE UNDER THEM THAT WOULD BE TREMENDOUS. AND THEN ALSO JUST PICK INNER BATTLES BECAUSE WE HAVE SUCH LIMITED RESOURCES WE DO LOOK AT EVERY PROCEEDING IN EVERY INVESTIGATION AND EVERY RULE MAKING GOING OKAY. WHAT CAN WE WIN IN THIS ONE OKAY WE OUT OF FOCUS AND THE ON THAT ONCE WE DO REALLY? GOOD HERE HAS VERY GOOD HERE ARE DEFINED AS SOMETHING HOLDING YOU BACK OR KEEPING YOU FROM KIND OF DOING WHAT YOU WANTED OTHER THAN THE RESOURCE ISSUE IN THE THE MANPOWER ISSUE THE CHANGES THERE ARE CHALLENGES WITH THAT. WELL WE WE WE HOUSE THE BENEFIT OF USING THE COMMISSION'S ATTORNEYS. WHICH WE HAVE TO HAVE ATTORNEYS BUT WE DON'T HAVE THE SUPPORT FROM THE ATTORNEYS THAT WE REALLY WERE SUPPOSED TO GET. SO THAT THAT'S HOLDING US BACK BECAUSE WE WE DEFINITELY NEED THAT IT SUPPORT WITH ATTORNEYS TO TO HELP OUR POSITION AND DEVICES. ALLEN PROCEEDINGS SO THAT'S BEEN A STRUGGLE. TO THEN I WOULD JUST I WOULD JUST SAY THAT -- QUICKLY ON TO THE WANT ONE SENSE IS -- I THINK THE UTILITIES TO FOCUS THEY DO RESPOND I THINK TO THE COMMISSION'S FOCUS. SO IF THERE'S SOMETHING THAT THE COMMISSION IS NOT FOCUSING ON IT GETS LESS ATTENTION AND I THINK THAT THAT CREATES. I HAVE SOME EXAMPLES LIKE IN THE ELECTRIC SIDE THE GAS SIDE WHERE I THINK THAT. YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE ANY PARTICULAR RULE OR SOME REQUIREMENTS FOR THAT -- AND SO THEN IT JUST DOESN'T GET THE ATTENTION IT DOESN'T GET THE THE IT DOESN'T COME UP AS A PROGRAM FOR THE UTILITY. SO I THINK THAT WE DO PLAY AND AND MAJOR PART IN TERMS OF IDENTIFYING AND LOOKING OVER WHAT DO YOU TELL THAT HE HAS AND WHAT IT DOESN'T HAVE I THINK IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT NEED THAT THE REGULATOR HAS TO PLAY. ON AND ON ON THE I'M. SO -- I AND I LOST THE OTHER SIDE INSIDE BUT ANYWAY I DO THINK THAT IT'S AT IT IS A VERY ALL IN IN IN TERMS OF ASSESSING CITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS. I THINK THAT THERE'S A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR HOW THAT CAN GO ABOUT HAPPEN IT CAN HAPPEN FROM COMMISSION STAFF IT CAN HAPPEN FROM THIRD PARTIES. IT CAN HAPPEN FROM THIRD -- FOR INDUSTRY CREDIT PARTIES I I DON'T SEE THAT ANY OF THEM HAS TO BE EXCLUSIVE OF THE OTHER IN THE JAMES REASON MODEL OF THE SWISS CHEESE YOU KNOW. KIND OF SYSTEM WHERE IT MAY ISS SOMETHING. AND SO I THINK THAT THE MORE LAYERS THAT YOU HAVE. THE MORE LIKELY YOU'RE GOING TO PREVENT AN INCIDENT SO -- I DO THINK THAT -- TO THE TO THE EXTENT WE CAN BE MORE BROAD ABOUT -- ABOUT YOU KNOW LOOKING FOR WHAT WE CAN IMPLEMENT OUR OR OUR BRING FORWARD I THINK THE FASTER WE'RE GOING. TO TO BRING DOWN -- OR OR TO BE ABLE TO REDUCE INCIDENTS THAT ARE THAT WE NAY REDUCE ANYWAY. THAT'S WONDERFUL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FOR AND TESTIFIED THAT IS VERY HELPFUL AND WE'RE LEARNING NOW IN MORE ABOUT. HOW SUCCESSFUL YOU HAVE BEEN AND WHAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING TO THANK YOU THANK YOU KNOW WELCOME CENTER IN NOW I'D LIKE TO INVITE UP OUR? SECOND PANEL OF HIS REALLY HOW TO PROMOTE UTILITY SAFETY AND THE ELISABETTA MOTION CALL. NICE TO SEE YOU DEPUTY DIRECTOR EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR SAFETY IN ENFORCEMENT DIVISION PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION AND INDUCTOR PAUL SCHULMAN CENTER FOR CATASTROPHIC RISK MANAGEMENT UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY AND THE DOCTOR CARLENE ROBERTS FROM THE CENTER FOR CATASTROPHIC RISK MANAGEMENT UC BERKELEY. WELCOME IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN [inaudible] MAKE YOURSELVES [inaudible] COMFORTABLE [inaudible] JOSH WATER. CLEARLY THERE ARE GOOD LIAM. YOU KNOW APPROVED WE'VE LOOKED AT THE AT THE ESSAYS WORK OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS AND AND WHILE I THINK THEY'VE. BEEN VERY THOUGHTFUL AND AND CARE DEEPLY ABOUT SAFETY AND AS WE ARE TODAY I A WORRY. I STILL WORRY THAT THEY'VE BEEN STYMIED BY THE PROCESS IS THE CPUC IN THE CHALLENGES THERE IS ONE OF THE NEWEST OFFICES. AT THE CPUC THEY PROVIDE A GOOD TEST FOR MEASURING THIS THIS FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION I THINK THE QUESTION IS DOES THE RATE CASE MENTALITY AND YOU'VE HEARD THIS BEFORE. AS THE RATE CASE MENTALITY THE CPUC DOES IT BLEED OVER TO ALL ASPECTS OF ITS GOVERNANCE IN SUCH A WAY THAT SAFETY IS IS MARGINALIZED IS GONNA PUT TO THE SIDE. OF THOSE RATE CASES THE GOVERNOR'S CLOAK CLEARLY STATED. IS CLOSE CLEARLY STATED REFORM OF THE CPUC NEEDS TO OCCUR AND BUT WHAT REFORM IS NECESSARY. ESPECIALLY BEYOND THE REFORM THAT HAS ALREADY OCCURRED WE'VE DONE THINGS OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS -- AND MADE SOME CHANGES BUT KNOW WHAT OTHER REFORMS ARE NECESSARY WITHIN THE CPC MANY YEARS AGO I CONSIDERED. WE THOUGHT ABOUT REMOVING THE SAFETY FROM THE CPUC AND THAT HAS BEEN A CONVERSATION AND WE SET SET ASIDE THAT IDEA BECAUSE I DON'T THINK WE WERE CONVINCED THAT A NEW ENTITY WOULD BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY. OR LEAD TO BETTER SAFETY OUTCOMES -- I I'M NOW KIND OF QUESTIONING THAT CONCLUSION. BECAUSE OF WHAT WE'VE SEEN OVER THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS AND I OF OF SO I'M APPRECIATE YOUR COMING TODAY TO MAYBE WE COULD HAVE THAT CONVERSATION A LITTLE BIT TO SEE IF WE BEEN SUCCESSFUL. OR IF THE MODEL OF HAVING SAFETY WITHIN THOSE RATE CASES WITHIN THE P. YOU SEE. A IS SOMETHING THAT -- THAT HAS WORKED SO WE IT TO PROFESSOR SHOWMAN AND AND ROBERT YOU'VE BEEN RESEARCHING AND WRITING ABOUT SAFETY FOR MANY YEARS AND HAVE RECENTLY. BEEN INVOLVED WITH THE C. P. U. C. L. LYSINE ITS SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AND IMPLEMENTATION. AND DIRECTOR MALASHENKO EIGHT YOU ARE AND AND HAVE BEEN -- THE HEAD OF THE SAFETY DIVISION CPUC AND NOW YOU'RE OVERSEEING BOTH -- ESSAY AS WELL AS THE AUDITOR'S AND COMPLIANCE OFFICERS AT THE COMMISSION JOURNALING YOU DON'T DO IT THE COMMISSION. SEEMS LIKE YOUR YOU'VE BEEN -- HAS WITH WATCHED -- OVER THE LAST NINE YEARS YOU'RE YOU KEEP EXPANDING. YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES AND AND THAT'S THAT'S A GOOD THING I THINK THE IT IT DID WITH THE SUCCESSES THAT YOU'VE HAD SO THAT'S NICE -- AND ASK A MEMBER OF THE UTILITY TO BE HERE TODAY TO BE PART OF THIS CONVERSATION BECAUSE I VIEW THEM. NO THERE REALLY AN IMPORTANT PLAYER IN THIS DIALOGUE THAT WE HAVE OF HOW SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS WORK AND HOW THEY COME TOGETHER. AND HOW THE REGULATED BUT ONE OF THE THEMES FROM THE SAFETY LITERATURE IS NEEDING TO HAVE CLEAR LINES OF COMMUNICATION. AND TRUST BETWEEN THE REGULATED ENTITIES AND THE REGULATORS WE WERE HOPING THAT US THE GENIE. COULD HIGHLIGHT INSTANCES OF WHERE THE CPUC HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN DEVELOPING THESE CHANNELS OF COMMUNICATION OR IF THEY MAY NOT HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL. WITHIN WITH INVITED THE OTHER UTILITIES AS WELL BUT OF THE UTILITIES WE SPOKE WITH -- WERE TROUBLES AT HAVING A PUBLIC DIALOGUE IN THE FILTER THAT WOULD NOT BE WELL RECEIVED BY THE REGULATOR IF THEY WERE SITTING HERE TALKING ABOUT THAT THAT'S UNFORTUNATE. BECAUSE THAT'S THE EXACT ISSUE WE RAISE IN THE BACKGROUND REPORT THAT THERE. LACKS OPEN COMMUNICATION AND CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HOW WE CAN IMPROVE THOSE -- SAFETY MANAGEMENT AT THE CPUC WHETHER IT'S WITHIN THE CPUC OR AS THEY REGULATE THE UTILITIES AND THAT'S THAT ADVERSARIAL RELATIONSHIPS OR ARE SO INDEBTED THAT EVEN CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM. CANNOT BE COMMUNICATED AND THAT'S WHAT WE SEE TODAY AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THE EMPTY CHAIR SIT IN THERE TODAY SO I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT BUT HOPEFULLY WE CAN HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND BRING SOMETHING FOR THAT WILL COME FROM IT SO. IF YOU'D LIKE TO THE OFFICIAL ONE IF YOU'D LIKE TO MAKE SOME COMMENTS OR OVERWORKED AND MAY MAYBE WILL WILL GO TO FILL DIRECTOR MOTION CO FIRST. AND IT WILL COME BACK IF. LOOK IN THE ORDER IN WHICH MY AGENDA IS I WAS GOING LEFT TO RIGHT SO. WELCOME AGAIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH GOOD AFTERNOON. ELM [inaudible] EIGHT THINK. OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS THE THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF CHANGE THE COMMISSION'S SIXTY FUNCTION OWN IT REALLY HAS THE CHANGE QUITE DRAMATICALLY IN MANY WAYS. L. BUT AT THE SAME TIME HOME. EIGHT THINK WHEN WE LOOK AT THE RESULTS IN THE IN THE INDUSTRY. AND THE CHALLENGES THE WE'RE CONTINUING TO HEALTH IN THE STATE'S [inaudible] L. O.. EVERYONE RECOGNIZES THAT IT'S NOT. ENOUGH [inaudible] AND EITHER WHEN WE IN -- STARTS ONE PACK THIS. AS TO WHY [inaudible] HELLO. YOU DO ONE THING THAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT. TO REMEMBER ABOUT THESE SYSTEMS. IS THE LENGTH OF TIME IT TAKES FOR ANY CHANGE TO REALLY HOW IMPACT IN THE FIELD AND THAT'S ONE THING THAT I THINK IS VERY DIFFERENCE. FROM. EITHER BETWEEN UTILITY OPERATIONS AND LET'S SAY EVEN LIKE AIRLINE INDUSTRY RIGHT IS JUST AMOUNT OF INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE HEALTH. IN THE FIELD AND HOME THE FACT THAT A LOT OF RESULTS THAT WE SEE THE RESULTS OF THE STORMS THAT ARE IN PLACE. ELEMENT AND THEY TAKE A LONG TIME. TO SHIFT. THROUGH THROUGH THE YOU KNOW YOU KIND OF OPERATING ON THESE TEN YEAR CYCLES. OF IN SOME CASES EVEN MORE WHEN YOU ACTUALLY CAN SEE THE SYSTEMIC RESULTS I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE REALLY BIG CHALLENGES. THAT WE HELD AS WE TRY. TO HELP IMPROVE THE SAFETY EL PARADIGM IN CALIFORNIA. IS. THAT WE TEND TO JUDGE PERFORMANCE ON THE VERY SPEED YOU THOUGH IMMEDIATE SORT OF SENSE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING. BUT THAT'S OT NECESSARILY A REFLECTION ALL OF ACTIONS. THE END OF THERE ARE ALSO TAKING PRE PLACE FOR FROM REGULATORY FOR POINT OF VIEW BECAUSE THERE IS SUCH A BIG OUT TIME LAG. AND YOU KNOW THAT IS ONE TOPIC THAT A CD CAME OVER GET MIX THEM ALL LAW IT ALL OF YOU KNOW WHEN WE TALKING FOR EXAMPLE ABOUT SEEK TO CULTURE. IS THAT. THERE IS ONLY SO MUCH THAT YOU CAN DO IN TERMS OF SAFETY CULTURE -- THAT HAS A VERY IMMEDIATE RESULTS IN THE FIELD. YEAR BECAUSE IN THE YOU KNOW A GALLON CAN OF GOING BACK TO THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY IS LIKE AN EXAMPLE. YOU KNOW WE YOU HEALTH OPERATORS ARE FLYING YOU KNOW PILOT IS FLYING A PLANE RIGHT AND THEY'RE MAKING CERTAIN DECISIONS AND EAT IF YOU SHIFT THE CULTURE YOU CAN SORT OF ON THE SHORTER TIME SCALE YOU KNOW SEE THE RESULTS THAT YOU HAVE WITH THE FOR OPERATION. THANK YOU FOR TRYING TO IMPROVE WORKER SAFETY ALL THAT THIS KIND OF QUESTIONS OF CULTURE. LANCE WITH A LITTLE BIT MORE RATE BECAUSE THEN YOU CAN CHANGE BEHAVIOR AND YOU CAN KIND OF MEASURE HOW MANY IN THE INJURIES OR INCIDENTS YOU HEALTH. BUT WHEN WAS STARTING TO TALK ABOUT ALL INFRASTRUCTURE AND INFRASTRUCTURE REPLACEMENTS AND HOW UTILITIES RUN THEIR SYSTEMS AND OF MEANS SEEING THEIR ASSETS. ELEMENT EVEN IF YOU HAVE A WORK FORCE EVE THAT. HOUSE COMPLETE FOCUS ON SAFETY CULTURE AND YOU HALL OF YOU KNOW ALL ISSUES RELATED TO THAT RESOLVED YOU WOULD STILL IT WOULD STILL TAKE YEARS FOR ACTUAL. CHANGES IN THE FIELD TO TAKE PLACE SO I THINK THAT ABOUT SOMETHING. ELM THAT. EIGHT L. WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO UNPACK OF WHERE. OR THE ISSUES IN THE IMMEDIATE PLANS. AND HOW DO WE CAN OVER MANAGE THAT TENSION BETWEEN WANTING TO SEE IMMEDIATE RESULTS IN MAKING LONG TERM CHANGES THAT MAY NOT ACTUALLY. HALL OF RESULTS THAT ARE YOU KNOW VERY MEDIA TO MEASURABLE. IN THAT'LL BE READY TO MY QUESTIONS WHEN WE GET THERE SO THANK YOU [inaudible] ADDITIONAL. ONE THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR HAVING US HERE AND WE KNOW THAT YOU'RE FACING AS A SUBCOMMITTEE A LOT OF REALLY IMPORTANT QUESTIONS AND POSSIBLY SOME. NEW RESPONSIBILITIES NOT ONLY FOR UTILITIES AND REGULATOR BUT FOR YOURSELVES AS AN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE. SO WHAT WE THOUGHT WE WOULD DO TO PERHAPS HELP YOUR DELIBERATIONS IS WE WOULD LOOK BACK OVER. OUR EXPERIENCE IN LOOKING AT ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAD TO MANAGE HAVE HAD TO MANAGE THE HAZARDOUS TECHNICAL SYSTEMS AND HAVE DONE SO SUCCESSFULLY IN. THOSE THAT HAVEN'T. AND TRY TO DISTILL WHAT WE THINK ARE SOME OF FOUNDATIONAL FUNCTIONS. THAT WE BELIEVE WOULD BE NECESSARY FOR EFFECTIVE SAFETY REGULATIONS. I JUST WANT TO TALK ABOUT A FEW OF THEM. AND USE THESE AS IN A SENSE STARTING POINTS FOR A CONVERSATION ABOUT OPTIONS. THE FIRST ONE THAT WE FIND IS REALLY IMPORTANT IS BELIEVE IT OR NOT ASKING QUESTIONS. AFTER THE DEEPWATER HORIZON -- ACCIDENT IN THE GULF OF MEXICO -- INVESTIGATION COMMITTEE WAS SET UP HE TOOK HOLD OF THE SAFETY HANDBOOK FOR THE DEEPWATER HORIZON RIG WHICH WAS A MASSIVE THING READ THROUGH WOOD COVER TO COVER. AND AT THE END OF IT HE SAID. HOW DO YOU KNOW WHEN IT'S BAD ENOUGH TO HAVE TO ACT FAST? THERE WAS NO ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IN THE HANDBOOK AND IN FACT IT TURNED OUT THAT ACCIDENT TURNED AROUND PEOPLE NOT REALIZING WHEN IT WAS BAD ENOUGH TO HAVE TO ACCESS. SO SOMETIMES ASKING KEY QUESTIONS EVEN IF EMBARRASSING I REALLY IMPORTANT WHEN WE LOOKED AT THESE -- ORGANIZATIONS THAT MANAGE THEIR SYSTEM PRETTY WELL DOWN TO THE CONTROL ROOM FOR EXAMPLE PEOPLE PLAY THE WHAT IF GAME. AND THEY WOULD STAND RUNS AROUND AND SEE WHAT WE LOST POWER RIGHT NOW WHEN THERE WAS AN EARTHQUAKE BUT WE DO. AND THAT WHAT IF GAME WAS PLAYED CONTINUALLY. AND THEY ARE CONSTANTLY ASKING THEMSELVES AND WORK PLANNING SESSIONS. HAVE WE MISSED ANYTHING IN THIS PLAN WHAT IF THIS ASSUMPTION TURNS OUT TO BE WRONG. AND THERE'S A CONSTANT QUESTIONING IN THESE ORGANIZATIONS -- AND THE QUESTION OF THE QUESTIONS IS REALLY IMPORTANT DOESN'T MEAN THEY HAVE TO HAVE AN ANSWER RIGHT AWAY THE PERSON WHO ASKS. BUT ASKING IT IS REALLY SIGNIFICANT PARTLY BECAUSE THEY ARE REALLY AFRAID OF MAKING ERRORS. ERRORS IN THE CALCULATION IN THE ANTICIPATION IN THE UNDERSTANDING OF THINGS. AND ASKING QUESTIONS AS A WAY IN WHICH THEY CAN SEE WHERE THE UNCERTAINTIES LIE IN THEIR OPERATIONS. SO THAT IS A REALLY IMPORTANT FUNCTION IN A SAFETY REGULATORY REGIME. IT CAN BE DISTRIBUTED IN MANY PLACES I'M THINKING THAT THIS IS ALSO A FUNCTION THAT YOU'RE SUBCOMMITTEE. CAN VERY PRODUCTIVELY ASK OF PEOPLE WHO TESTIFY FROM THE COMMITTEES FROM THE COMMISSION AND FROM THE UTILITIES. WHAT WE'VE SEEN SO FAR IN THE OFFICE OF THE SAFETY ADVOCATE? IS IT THIS IS KIND OF A DIFFICULT THING FOR THEM TO DO SIMPLY ASK QUESTIONSAND PART OF IT IS BECAUSE THEY FEEL IT SEEMS TO US. THEY HAVE TO ADVOCATE FOR SOMETHING. THEY HAVE TO HAVE AN ACTUAL PROPOSITION. AND IN A SENSE IF THEY ARE ASKING A QUESTION THEY SHOULD BE PROVIDING AN ANSWER. AND THIS IS OUR UNDERSTANDABLE IN A SENSE BECAUSE THE NEW ORGANIZATION AND THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT THE A STANDING THEY HAVE IN THE REST OF THE UP YOU SEE AND I JUST WANTED. USE THIS FOR THE MOMENT TO SAY THAT FROM OUR STANDPOINT. IT HAS BEEN A VERY ROCKY INTRODUCTION FOR THE OS EIGHT INTO THE CPUC -- THEY ARE. THEY HAVE BEEN STUCK INTO AN ORGANIZATION THAT HAS MANY OTHER COMPETING MISSIONS THE SAFETY. THAT HAS MANY OTHER ORGANIZATIONS THAT CONSIDER SAFETY PART OF WHAT THEY DO. AND THEY HAVE BEEN UNDERSTAFFED CERTAINLY IN STAFF BUT ALSO IN ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED. AND THE CPUC ITSELF HAS NEVER BEEN PROPERLY [inaudible] INTRODUCED. TO THE FUNCTIONS THE FULL RANGE OF FUNCTIONS THAT NEED TO BE DONE BY AN OFFICE OF THE SAFETY ADVOCATE QUESTION ASKING IS ONE OF THEM. THEY DON'T HAVE TO HAVE THE ANSWERS. THEY CAN ASK QUESTIONS AND PROCEEDING AND FORCE OTHER PEOPLE TO THINK ABOUT ANSWERS AND THAT IS APPROPRIATE SAFETY ADVOCACY AS WELL. WHAT THE CPC SHOULD HAVE DONE IT SEEMS TO ME IS? TO HAVE HAD A FORMAL INTRODUCTION OF THAT ROLE FOR THAT THE ROLES FOR THAT OFFICE SOCIALIZE THE REST OF THE COMMISSION. TO ACCEPTING THEM THEY ARE NOT GOING TO BE JUST ANOTHER DIVISION SAFETY SHOULD BE A PREEMINENT ISSUE FOR THE CPUC. THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE TO COMPETE. FOR AGENDA SPACE WITH OTHER -- DIVISIONS AND OTHER UNITS. AND SO ON OUR VIEW IS THAT IT'S NOT TOO LATE BY THE WAY FOR THE SI PC TO DO A BETTER INTRODUCTION. IT MIGHT BE WORTHWHILE TO ACTUALLY TALK ABOUT SAFETY ADVOCACY FUNCTIONS AND WHAT'S REQUIRED FOR EFFECTIVE SAFETY REGULATION. WITHIN THE WHOLE COMMISSION -- SO THAT'S ONE ONE ISSUE A SECOND FOUNDATION FUNCTION IS RESEARCH AND ANALYSIS. THE BEST SAFETY. REGULATORY REGIMES THOSE ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE FAA IN THE NRC. THEY DO THEIR OWN RESEARCH A LOT OF IT THEY GIVE GRANTS FOR RESEARCH THEY HAVE PEOPLE AROUND WHO ARE EXPERTS. IN THAT PROCESS OF RESEARCH IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR NOT JUST. KNOWING. WHAT ISSUES ARE GOING TO CONFRONT THEM THE RESEARCH GIVES THEM A FORWARD LOOKING LOOK AT THE? STATE OF REACTIVE LOOK. ON BUT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT FOR THEM TO ACTUALLY DO. AND MAKE REGULATORY DECISIONS RIGHT NOW THE CPUC IS CONSIDERING IN ONE OF ITS MAJOR PROCEEDINGS. OPTIONS FOR RESTRUCTURING P. JEANNIE WITH RESPECT TO PROMOTING ITS SAFETY CULTURE. THAT IS A VERY DIFFICULT QUESTION WE DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW HOW TO GROW SAFETY CULTURE IN AN ORGANIZATION [inaudible] CONCLUSIVELY SYSTEMATICALLY THEY'RE ASKING THAT QUESTION SO -- BASICALLY WHATEVER THEY DECIDE IN TERMS OF RESTRUCTURING. IS GOING TO BE ON ON CERTAIN PROPOSITION. THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FOLLOW VERY CAREFULLY. THE DEVELOPMENT OF WHATEVER THEY DECIDE IN P. JEANNIE THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE. GOOD INSPECTIONS BUT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE MET THEY NEED THEY NEED METRICS. RIGHT NOW THE P. YOU SEE HAS NO. SAFETY METRICS. THEY DON'T REGULATE FOR SAFETY MANAGEMENT THEY HAVE NO ORGANIZATIONAL METRICS FOR SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM OR FOR SAFETY CULTURE. PART OF THAT IS BECAUSE THEY DON'T DO A LOT OF RESEARCH. AND BY NOT DOING THAT RESEARCH IT SEEMS TO US. THEY PUT THEMSELVES IN A VERY DIFFICULT POSITION RELATIVE TO DECISION MAKING AND FOLLOWING THROUGH ON WHAT THEY DECIDE TO DO. SO OUR VIEW IS THAT RESEARCH IS REALLY IMPORTANT -- THE ESSAY IN OUR REGIONAL UNDERSTAND WHAT IT COULD BE WOULD HAVE BEEN -- SAFETY ANALYSIS THE OFFICER SAFETY ANALYSIS AND WOULD HAVE HAD. SAFETY EXPERTS WITH ON ON STAFF. TO ACTUALLY DO FOR LOOKING RESEARCH. THIS IS WERE POSSIBLY INDEPENDENT SAFETY REGULAR AN INDEPENDENT UTILI SAFETY BOARD COULD BE HELPFUL WITH EXPERTS WHO WOULD ACTUALLY DO RESEARCH USEFUL FOR THE PC -- SO. IN THAT SENSE THAT'S A FUNCTION THAT NEEDS TO BE TENDED TO AND UNLIKE MANY OTHER SAFETY REGULATORY ORGANIZATIONS. IN OUR VIEW THE CPUC IS VERY. UNDER OF ORGANIZED FROM THE STANDPOINT OF DOING SAFETY RESEARCH. A THIRD ISSUE IS ACCIDENT AND INCIDENT INVESTIGATION IS REALLY IMPORTANT FUNCTION FOR ALL SAFETY REGULATORY. ORGANIZATIONS -- SOME USE EXTERNAL USES THE EXTERNAL ORGANIZATION THE FAA USES THE NTSB. AND ACTUALLY -- THE CPUC AFTER THE SAN BRUNO EXPLOSION HAD CREATED AN INDEPENDENT DISTILLERY INVESTIGATORY PANEL THAT REALLY DID A REALLY NICE. REVIEW -- BUT A LOT OF THE INCIDENT AN ACCIDENT INVESTIGATIONS ARE DONE BY IN HOUSE. CPUC PEOPLE THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT THEY ARE -- DIRECTED MOST OF THEM BY ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGES. FROM OUR UNDERSTANDING THOSE ALE JAY'S HAVE NO TRAINING IN ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS. NO TRAINING SAFETY MANAGEMENT NO TRAINING SAFETY CULTURE. SO PART OF THIS IS AGAIN WHAT DO THEY KNOW THE RIGHT TO WRITE THE TO ENHANCE THE RIGHT QUESTIONS FROM THAT WE THINK THAT THAT PROCESS COULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY UPGRADED -- ANOTHER FUNCTION INSPECTIONS AND ENFORCEMENT -- THIS IS WHERE I THINK. A LOT OF ADVANCE AND UPGRADING REALLY NEEDS TO BE DONE. THE NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION HAS TWO FULL TIME RESIDENT INSPECTORS ON EVERY PLANE AT EVERY PLANT IT OPERATE IT IT OVERSEAS AND ALL OF THE FUEL PROCESSING PLANTS THEY ARE THERE FULL TIME. THEY CAN GO TO ANY MEETING THEY WISH. TO THE P. YOU SEE HAS. SOME CERTAINLY HAS SOME -- INSPECTORS BUT THEY PERIODICALLY VISIT IT'S TOUGH TO KEEP TRACK OF THE LARGE UTILITY BUT THEY ONLY MAKE PERIODIC VISITS. AND THEY HAVE ARE. REALLY NO TRAINING IN THE WHAT TO LOOK FOR FROM THE STANDPOINT OF SAFETY MANAGEMENT OR SAFETY CULTURE WHEN THEY GO TO DO THAN INSPECTIONS. AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT A HIGHLY TRAINED AND PROFESSIONAL LIES. INSPECTION STAFF COULD ENERGIZE THE SAFETY MANAGEMENT AND REGULATORY APPROACH OF THE ENTIRE AGENCY AND THAT'S SOMETHING TO TO REALLY CONSIDER. ONE OF THE THINGS IN OUR VIEW THAT CAUSES SOME PROBLEMS IS A WE SAW THIS IN OUR VISIT IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN A A AN UNUSUAL -- DIVISION THAT IS NOT EVEN EQUALLY UNDERSTOOD BY EVERYBODYBETWEEN ADVICE AND ADVOCACY AND BETWEEN POLICY AND ENFORCEMENT. SUBTOTAL OF THESE DIVISIONS. MAKE MOST INSPECTORS THAT WE TALKED TO BELIEVE IT'S NOT THEIR ROLE. TO GIVE ADVICE ON POLICY. AND IT WOULDN'T BE BECAUSE IT'S NOT APPROPRIATE FOR ENFORCERS. TO MAKE THE LAWS THAT THEY IN FORCE. WELL THIS IS NOT SOMETHING WE BELIEVE IS REALLY USEFUL AND IN FACT BY DOING THAT. THEY DENY POLICY THE PEOPLE AT THE POLICY LEVEL A LOT OF INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT THEIR SEED. IN THESE UTILITIES. AND WHAT REGULATIONS ARE WORKING WELL FROM THEIR STANDPOINT ENTERS A COMPLIANCE INEFFECTIVENESS AND WHICH ONES. ARE NOT AND WHAT GAPS THERE CURRENTLY ARE THAT IS REALLY USEFUL INFORMATION. I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THE INSPECTOR FORCE BECOME IT'S OWN PROFESSIONAL GROUP. AND BUILD ITS OWN. ESPRIT AND BE A REALLY POSITIVE FORCE FOR THE UPGRADING OF THAT INSPECTION ROLE WITHIN THE UTILITY. MONITORING SAFETY DRAFT. THE FACT IS SAFETY IS NOT A BUILDING YOU BUILDING IT'S ONCE AND FOR ALL IT'S A CONSTANT PROCESS THAT DEGRADES AND HAS TO BE RESTORED. WHEN WE'VE LOOKED AT WHAT WE CALL HIGH RELIABILITY ORGANIZATIONS WHAT WE SEE IS NOT VARIANCE? WHAT WE SEE IS THE FLUCTUATION IN REALLY IMPORTANT THINGS LIKE ATTENTION THAT PEOPLE PAY COMMUNICATION PROCESSES THAT OCCUR AND DON'T OCCUR -- TRUST BETWEEN THE UNITS. THAT THE CASE AND THEY CONSTANTLY HAVE TO MANAGE THESE THEY LOOK FOR SIGNALS OF DECAY. AND THEY BASICALLY DO WHAT THEY CAN TO RENEW THE FERVOR AS ONE PERSON PUT IT TO ME IN A NUCLEAR POWER PLANT. SO THEY MANAGED FLUCTUATIONS OF THE AMPLITUDE IS NOT TOO GREAT. THAT SEEMS TO ME TO BE -- OF THAT MONITORING OF SAFETY DRIFT CAN ALSO BE DONE IN A UTILITY. I MEAN IN A REGULATOR. YOU SEE HAS SO MANY POLICIES IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE DEALING WITH SIMULTANEOUSLY RENEWABLE FUELS ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION. OUR GLOBAL WARMING IS NOW A BIG ISSUE APPARENTLY. RATE AFFORDABILITY AS WELL AS NOW WORRYING ABOUT THE FINANCIAL COLLAPSE. OF A MONOPOLY UTILITY AND THE LOSS OF SERVICE THAT COULD COME FROM THAT. THAT'S A LOT TO PUT ON PEOPLE'S PLATES AND SO IT'S NOT SURPRISING THAT THE ATTENTION FOCUSED ON SAFETY COULD DRAFT MAINTAINING. READING WHAT WE CALL WEAK SIGNALS OF THAT PROCESS BEGINNING IS REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE SEE. AS A REALLY CRITICAL ROLE FOR THE OSL BUT THE I SAY IF IT COULD BECOME INSTITUTIONALIZED. SO THAT IT WOULD HAVE THE SUPPORT. UP THE COURAGE. AND THE RESOURCES TO DO THAT. ALSO THAT'S THAT'S ANOTHER THING THAT WE THINK WOULD BE REALLY IMPORTANT. YOU COULD IMAGINE EXTERNAL ORGANIZATION REVIEWING THIS BUT THEY HAVE TO INTERFERE ALL THE TIME AND IT WOULD NOT BE AS EFFECTIVE IT SEEMS TO US AS AN IN HOUSE -- ONE BUT IT IS ALSO AN AREA BY THE WAY WHERE THE SUBCOMMITTEE COULD LOOK FOR SIGNS AS WELL IN THEIR OVERSIGHT ROLE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE FOCUS ON SAFETY HAS NOT DEGRADED. OVER TIME AND OVER ALL OF THE STRESS AND THE OTHER FUNCTIONS EXPERTS TO PERFORM [inaudible] LASTLY. CONTINUOUS PRESSURE FOR IMPROVEMENT CHRIS TALKED ABOUT THAT IS A REALLY IMPORTANT THING. A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS THERE EFFECTIVE ARE WORRIED THAT IF THEY DON'T CONSTANTLY IMPROVE THEY'RE GONNA GET WORSE. BECAUSE IT'S NOT A STEADY STATE. COMPLACENCY WILL COME IN IF YOU'RE NOT CONSTANTLY TRYING TO GET BETTER. AND THAT PRESSURE FOR GETTING BETTER CAN BE DISTRIBUTED ALL OVER THE PLACE. IT CAN BE DISTRIBUTED DOWN AT THE SHOP LEVEL IF PEOPLE SEE BETTER PROCEDURES THAT COULD OR PROCEDURES AND AREN'T WORKING AND WAYS TO IMPROVE THEM. AND USE THAT INFORMATION PUSH. FOR IMPROVEMENT ONE OF THE BEST NUCLEAR RUN NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS WE SAW. WAS REALLY INTERESTING THE SHOP LEVEL PEOPLE OWN THE PROCEDURES THEY WERE THE ONES WHO PROPOSED NEW PROCEDURES REVISIONS AND PROCEDURES AND CARRIED IT ALL THE WAY THROUGH. FORMAL PROCESS TO CHANGE THOSE PROCEDURES THAT'S A KIND OF PUSH AT THAT LEVEL BUT IT CAN OCCUR EVERYWHERE THE OSA SHOULD BE CONSTANTLY LOBBYING AND FEEL POWERFUL ENOUGH TO DO IT. FOR THE DEFECATION OF SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS NOT JUST WAITING FOR UP [inaudible] A PROCEED. WHERE EVERYBODY'S IN A REACTIVE MODE IN THEIR IN STATE ADVERSARIAL RELATIONSHIP BUT ACTUALLY PRO SUSPECTED PRO? IDENTIFYING THINGS AND PUSHING HARD I KNOW CHRIS WOULD LOVE TO DO THAT IF YOU HAD MORE STAFF AND IF THEY WERE. IF HIS PROPOSALS WERE INSTITUTIONALIZED WITH RESPECT TO THE SUPPORT THE OSA HAS TO MAKE THEM. IN IN THE CPUC IN -- SO IN ANY CASE THESE ARE THE KINDS OF FUNCTIONS THAT WE THINK ARE NECESSARY. YOU'LL HAVE TO THINK THROUGH CAREFULLY WHERE THEY SHOULD BE PLACED OR HOW TO PROMOTE THEM -- BUT I THINK IT'S AT A CRITICAL TIME FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE. FOR ACTUALLY YOUR COMMITTEE TO DECIDE OKAY WE'RE NOT I DON'T THINK EITHER CARLINA RIGHTS ARE CONFIDENT. THAT THE TRAJECTORY AHEAD IS ON SOME SORT OF AUTOMATIC PILOT TO SAFETY WE DON'T SEE THAT AT ALL. SO I THINK SOM MAJOR RETHINKING IS REALLY IMPORTANT AT ALL LEVELS AND IN ALL PLACES THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOCTOR DOCTOR ROBERTS WOULD GIVE SOME. CALLING. AFTER FROM THE OF SIR THANK YOU. I THINK DOCTOR ASSAULT SAID ABOUT THE BEST IT COULD BE SAID I MEAN WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THESE ISSUES. FOR QUITE AWHILE NOW -- I HAVE WORKED OF WITH -- ORGANIZATIONS TO DO QUITE WELL IN FACT IT WOULD LET ME UNLESS THEY DID QUITE WELL BECAUSE I TALK TOO MUCH -- AND SO THAT THAT WERE DOING WELL I'D ALSO SAY THAT BUT IN IN THAT IN THAT INSTANCE YOU DO SEE -- HI TRUSTS GOOD COMMUNICATION AND AND NOT AN OVERLOAD IN FACT IF YOU HAVE LOOKED AT THE NEWSPAPERS RECENTLY ABOUT SEVERAL US NAVY SHIPS THAT GOT INTO A LOT OF TROUBLE. IT WAS BECAUSE IT WAS SAID I I DIDN'T LOOK AT SPECIFICALLY. IT WAS SAID THAT PART OF WHAT WAS LACK OF TRAINING. AND PART OF WHAT WAS OVERLOAD THEY HAD TAKEN PEOPLE CREW OFF THOSE SHIPS. AND SO THEY HAD TOO MANY PEOPLE DOING -- DOING THE JOBS THAT MORE PEOPLE SHOULD OF DONE ON ON THOSE SHIPS AND SO I THINK THAT THE THE THINGS THAT WE'RE SEEING WITH -- CEBU SEE ARE ARE IN GREAT PARK OVERLOAD. AND I'D LIKE TO SEE SOME OF THAT DISTRIBUTED BUT YOU CAN'T DISTRIBUTED WITH ALSO JUST WITHOUT ALSO DISTRIBUTING. TRUST AND COMMUNICATION CAN'T BE DONE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WELL WHAT I WANTED IT'S IT'S THANKS FOR THAT PRESENTATION IT'S KIND OF KIND OF SET THE TONE I THINK IN AND REYES A COUPLE OF OTHER ISSUES AND AND ONE IN PARTICULAR THE CAN I GUESS TO THE WHAT. THE THREAT THRESHOLD QUESTION I THINK THAT -- WE'RE INVOLVED WITH INTER DURING THE JANUARY TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE HEARING WE HAD IN SANTA ROSA -- IT PRESIDENT PICKER NOTED AND I'LL QUOTE WE THIS IF YOU SEE WERE NOT DESIGNED TO BE SPEEDY WE WERE DESIGNED TO SLOW THINGS DOWN. AND WE LITIGATE EVERYTHING JUST AS IF WE WERE A COURT OF LAW WHICH CAUSE. TO PROMOTION BECAUSE COMMENTS ABOUT HOW THINGS JUST GONNA TAKE TEN YEARS -- OR SOMETIMES THINGS MOVE KIND OF SLOWLY BECAUSE THE PROCESSES ARE SLOW PROCESS EASY EQUALLY QUESTIONS SAFETY REGULATION RATE MAKING REGULATION OF THE UTILITIES. BEING HOUSED IN THE SAME AGENCY SO SELECT ASK USED ALL OF YOUR THOUGHTS ON THIS -- DO YOU BELIEVE ONE ORGANIZATION SHOULD BE BOTH THE RATE REGULATOR AND A SAFETY REGULATOR OR OR DO THESE. KIND OF GOT A RESULT IN UNTENABLE CONFLICTS BECAUSE OF THEIR INHERENT NATURE AND IF IT'S DONE IN ONE ORGANIZATION. IT'S AN UPHILL CLIMB TO PROTECT SAFETY. IN RELATIONSHIP TO A HUGE CONCENTRATION ON RATES. BRINGING SAFETY INTO THE RATE CASE. IS INHERENTLY PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE SAFETY CAN'T BE MEASURED IN THE SAME WAY THAT CAPACITY AND COSTS ARE. AND BECAUSE SAFETY. IN A SENSE IF YOU HAVE SAFETY THEN YOU. IT'S HARD TO VALUE THINGS THAT DON'T HAPPEN. AND SO IT'S HARD TO BUILD UP A HEAD OF STEAM TO RAISE RATES TO IMPROVE SAFETY. IF PEOPLE DON'T FEEL THAT IT'S A CRISIS SITUATION AND THE OTHER THING IS I'M AFRAID AND I HAVE SEEN SOME EVIDENCE I WON'T SAY WHERE. OF UTILITY SIMPLY MANAGING THEIR SAFETY TO THE RATE CASE. IF THEY DON'T THINK THEY'RE GOING TO GET. A COMPENSATION IN RATES THAT IS NOT A SAFE INVESTMENT THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE. AND PART OF THE ISSUE IS TO FIND A WAY TO STIMULATE. THE UTILITIES THEMSELVES TO UNDERTAKE SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS. AND IF THE RATE CASE ISTHE WAY THEY MANAGE SAFETY INVESTMENTS THENSAFETY IT SEEMS TO ME IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE [inaudible] A UNDER APPRECIATED AND UNDER DEFENDED. PROPERTY SO I THINK IT'S NOT IMPOSSIBLE BUT IT'S A VERY UPHILL BATTLE IN WE CERTAINLY SAW THAT WITH P. JEANNIE AFTER THE SAN BRUNO EXPLOSION I MEAN THEY CERTAINLY DID MAKE MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS IN THEIR GAS SYSTEM I MEAN THEY WERE FORCED TO DO THAT BY THE P. UC'S CERTAINLY. AND BY THE LEGISLATURE. TO TO IMPROVE THAT BUT THEY TOTALLY NEGLECTED THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HOUSE AND IN THAT'S WERE WERE SHAPE YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT SAFETY IF THEY HAD THE CULTURE AND IT HADN'T BEEN INVOLVED IN RATE. SINCE SOME FORM THEY WOULD HAVE MADE THAT INVESTMENT OR FELT THAT THEY COULD DO THAT AND SHOULD HAVE DONE THAT SO. I I THINK YOU YOU'RE YOU'RE RIGHT IN THAT IT BUT I DON'T KNOW BUT PRETTY MUCH AND WE HAVE A WE HAVE IT AT TWO EXAMPLES OF WHERE IT OF IF YOU REALLY WANT. TO HAVE EXAMPLES OF WHERE THE RATE SAFETY. COMBINATION DOESN'T WORK AND ONE IS IN THE MARITIME INDUSTRY WHERE YOU HAD MINERAL MANAGEMENT SERVICES. DOING BOTH -- LOOKING AT SAFETY AND RATES AND EVERYTHING ELSE AND THEN WE HAD THE P.. AND THOUGH IT KILLED A LOT OF FISH AND SOME PEOPLE AND DID A LOT OF DAMAGE. AND SO THE MIDDLE MANAGEMENT SERVICE WAS CLOSED DOWN AND THAT THE FUNCTIONS WERE DIVIDED INTO TWO AGENCIES ONE OF WHOSE NAME I'VE FORGOTTEN BUT THE OTHERS BSE EATING. THE OTHER EXAMPLES FUKUSHIMA. WHERE YOU HAD -- OF INSTEAD OF INCEST ESSENTIALLY BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE PEOPLE WERE WHO HAD WRITTEN CHARGE OF RATES AS SAFETY ON THE REGULATORY SIDE WE'RE CHANGING JOBS WITH PEOPLE IN THE IN THE UTILITY. AND THAT CAN GET TO BE A REALLY DANGEROUS SORT OF THING WEEK WE'VE. HAD SOME EXAMPLES THAT HERE IN THE UNITED STATES THAT THAT TURNED INTO A REALLY BIG AXIS SO IF YOU NEED EXAMPLES OF WHERE THEY SHOULD BE. INDEPENDENT OF ONE OF THE THAT THAT'S AT LEAST [inaudible] TWO SOME. ULTIMATELY THINK THE ODDS THEY CAN BOOK WORK BOTH WAYS. THERE ARE KNOWN. IS. A WOMAN'S. OVER WHAT IT SEEKS TO HALL OF THE ECHO. OF FUNCTIONAL SAFETY PARADIGM AND THAT THE CURRENT TO GAPS IN THAT THAN THOSE GAPS NEEDS TO BE RESOLVED. AND THEY NEED TO BE RESOLVED WITHIN THEIR WITHIN THE P. YOU SEE OR THAT THEIR EXTERNAL TO THE PC AND THE SOME PROS AND CONS TO DOING IT DIFFERENT WAYS BUT ELEMENT EACH YEAR TO THIS QUESTION ALL OF THE P. YOU SEE HOW BEING THESE COMPETING PRIORITIES IN THIS. KIND OF INHERENT CONFLICT BETWEEN RATE MAKING AND SAFETY ELM YEAR THE UPSIDE OF HAVING A SINGLE AGENCY TO DEAL WITH THIS IS REFLECTS THE REALITIES OF WHAT THE OPERATORS ARE DEALING WITH. BECAUSE SAFETY IS NOT THE ONLY GOAL OF THE UTILITY THEIR YOUTH THERE ARE YOU KNOW IT'S HERE TO SERVE A PURPOSE. AND WE PUT A LOT OF REQUIREMENTS WE MEETING COLLECTIVELY RATES AS AS A L. AS SOCIETY IT RATE OF WHAT WE ONCE. THE UTILITIES -- TOOL FOR FILL RATES WE WE NEED THEM TO SERVE AND PROVIDE POWER OF WILL ELECTRIC WERE NATURAL GAS WE ARE OR WARNING THEM TO MEET THE IN HOUSE GAS REDUCTION GOALS AND PROMOTES. L. COULD CLAIM ITS IT CHANGE CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION ALL GOALS AND RENEWABLES WE L. BUT YOU KNOW WE'RE LOOKING AT THE LECTURE FLYING THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR ALL OF THESE GOALS ARE BEING SETS BY A POLICY MAKERS. HOME AND THE U. S. AND WE HOW WILL BE ASLI THE COST ASPECTS OF THE EARTH. THAT'S IS A REALITY ALL OF THE ENERGY SECTOR AND YOU CAN LAW IT LOOK AT SEE. IN ISOLATION FROM EVERYTHING ELSE BECAUSE THE OPERATORS HEALTH TO MAKE EL ECONOMIC HELP TO MAKE THE ENTIRE THING WORK AND WE NEED TO HEALTH POLICY -- THAT ALSO IS COHESIVE AND MAKES. SENSE AS IN ITS TOTALITY FROM CLOTH TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS ALL THE WAY THROUGH SAFETY AND IF WE AS REGULATORS CAN LIGHT RECONCILE OF THOSE PRIORITIES. HELP HOW DO WE EXPECT THE OPERATORS TO RECONCILE THEM. ALL MAKE IT THE YIELD AND THE WAY YOU THINK THAT. ELEMENT THIS WHOLE NOTION THAT WE CAN JUST MOVE SAFETY OVER INTO SOMEWHERE ELSE AND THUS. GET RID OF THOSE PROBLEM THAT EXIST IN THE INDUSTRY IS A YOU KNOW LOOKING FOR A SUITABLE SHORT CUT UNFORTUNATELY I DON'T BELIEVE EXISTS WE HOW OLD THE YOU KNOW A BIG CHALLENGE. L. IN IN THE IN THE IN THIS INDUSTRY ELM. AND WHERE THE HELL ALL YOU ACTUALLY YOU WILL MAKE ALL OF THE WORK SO I THINK IN THAT SENSE ACTUALLY THERE IS A BENEFIT TO HAVING. TO CONTINUING HELPING THIS FUNCTION WITHIN THE WITHIN THE COMMISSION THE SECOND POINT THAT I WOULD ADD IS THAT YOU DO THIS VERY THIS DIFFERENT ELEMENTS. TO SAFETY FUNCTIONS FROM E. L. FROM THE STATE'S AND REGULATORY POINTS OF VIEW SO THERE IS THE OUT THE POLICY MAKING FUNCTION. RATE WHEN YOU SET REGULATIONS AND TELL THE UTILITIES WHAT TO DEAL -- THERE IS THE THE SAFETY ASSURANCE. FUNCTION THERE'S DIDN'T FORCE ONE FUNCTION THERE'S THE SAFETY PROMOTION FUNCTION AND THEY'RE NOT ALL NECESSARILY THE SAME SO -- HOME [inaudible] EITHER. IT -- WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT IS THE ROLE OF THE PC AND WHAT SHOULD BE DOING? YOU KNOW I THINK THERE ARE YOU'LL SOME SO YOU KNOW WE GET WE CAN BREAK THAT THAT QUESTION UP A LITTLE BIT. OHM'S SO SO. FOUR YEAR WIN IT SO DOES ONE ASPECT TO DO WITH POLICY. L. UNIT ONE OF THE OTHER GAPS THAT YOU KNOW THAT USES AN EXAMPLE IS IN THE HOME IS IT IN THE BOOTS ON THE GROUND KIND OF INSPECTION THAT WAS NEVER THE FUNCTION OF THE PC IN THE ELECTRIC SPACE WERE NEVER STAFF DESIGNED TO ACTUALLY BE GOING. OUT THERE AND INSPECTING INFRASTRUCTURE AT SCALE. HOME ALL WERE FIFTY FUNCTION AT THE COMMISSION IS BASED ON THE INVESTIGATION OF INCIDENTS AND OUGHT IT'S VERY DIFFERENT FUNCTION FOR BOOTS ON THE GROUND KIND OF INSPECTION. THE RIGHT NOW IT'S A GAP WE PERFORM THIS SO. THE BOOK MORE OF THAT ACTUAL PHYSICAL INSPECTION. ELEMENT THE WORK ON THE REAL SIDE WHERE WE HOME INSPECTOR SEXUALLY WALK TRACK. ULTIMATE I DID SOME CALCULATIONS SORT OF BACK OF THE ENVELOPE OF WHAT KIND OF STAFFING WE WOULD NEED ON THE ELECTRIC SIDE TO DO. THE SAME KIND OF HAVE THE SAME RATIO OF INSPECTORS. ELEMENTS WHO INFRASTRUCTURE IS WE DO ON RAIL SO. WHAT WE DO ON RAILS ABOUT FORTY PEOPLE JUST YOU KNOW JUST THINKING MILES IT WOULD SEEK WERE ABOUT? FIFTEEN HUNDRED OF PEOPLE. TO DO THE SAME LEVEL OF INSPECTIONS ON THE ELECTRIC SIDE RATE SO WE'RE ABOUT A THOUSAND PEOPLE AGENCY THAT IS SET UP TO DO POLICY. IF WE WERE TO INTRODUCE ANOTHER THOUSAND THEN THE HEALTH PEOPLE TO DO -- FIELD INSPECTION THAT CHANGES FUNDAMENTALLY THE TYPE OF AN AGENCY THAT WE ARE SO I THINK WHEN WE'RE LOOKING IF THE STATE WANTS. TO CLOSE THIS GAP DOESN'T DIFFERENT OPTIONS RATE WE CAN HIRE YOU KNOW IN ADDITIONAL THOUSAND OR SO PEOPLE OF THE P. YOU SEE AND TRAIN THEM ON HOW THAT AND HOUSE INSPECTION SOUTH WE COULD. DO THIS WITH THIRD PARTIES AND CONTRACT. RATE THAN INDEPENDENT EVALUATORS OR WEAKENED HOUSE OF ONE ANOTHER AGENCY LIKE HELL FIRE RATE THAT -- YOU KNOW MAYBE IS BETTER AND UP-TO HAVING A LARGE WORK FORCE. WELL YOU KNOW THE OTHER THING THAT ALL -- AND LEAVE IT YOU KNOW OPEN FOR QUESTIONS BUT I JUST WANT TO SAY ONE MORE THING ABOUT YOU KNOW THIS WHOLE QUESTION OF CREATING ANOTHER AGENCY [inaudible] HOME. EIGHT A SINGLE TIMIDLY CAN WORK BOTH WAYS LIKE I SAID LIKE IF YOU WANTED TO PULL THE SAFETY FUNCTION YOU EITHER IN THIS ENTIRE DAY OR A PIECE OF IT OUT OF THE P. YOU SEE AND CREATE ANOTHER AGENCY I THINK IT CAN WORK. BUT IT IS YOU KNOW IT'S SIX TIME IT'S SIX RESOURCES AND YOU KNOW TO DO IT PROPERLY YOU KNOW WE WOULD REALLY NEED TO BE FUNDED THAT SCALE AND WHAT I'VE SORT OF SEEING THE DRAFT ON THESE CONVERSATIONS HAPPEN AS YOU START OFF WITH TALKING WITH CREATING ANOTHER AGENCY. AND THEN YOU END UP JUST SAYING WELL WE'LL JUST STICK IT WITHIN LIKE OFFICE OF FIRE MARSHALL FOR YOU KNOW ALL OR SOMEWHERE ELSE YOU THE WITHIN THE STATE STRUCTURE BECAUSE ONCE YOU START DOING THE CALCULATIONS WITH AT ACTUALLY IT SEEKS. TO SET UP AN ENTIRELY INDEPENDENT AGENCY AND THE NUMBER OF YEARS THAT WOULD SEEK TO ESTABLISH IT IS IT'S IT'S A MASSIVE LEFT RIGHT AND I THINK IT'S HARD YOU KNOW FOR ME RIGHT NOW LIKE. YOU KNOW MY NUMBER ONE PRIORITY IS ADDRESSING THE WHILE FOR A CHALLENGE TO HELP IN THE STATE AND YOU KNOW IF YOU HAVE A LIMITED NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO CAN WORK ON THESE KIND OF CHALLENGES TO WORK CIVIL TEDIOUSLY ON EXCEL RATING. OUR RESPONSE TO WILD FIRES WHILE AT THE SAME TIME TRAINS THE ABOLITION MASSIVE NEW AGENCY WE'RE JUST GONNA NOT HOW ENOUGH PEOPLE. IN THE STATES WHO ARE WELL VERSED ENOUGH IN THESE ISSUES WHO CAN DO BOTH SO I THINK THAT SORT OF THE STRUGGLE THAT HALL WAS IN THE HALL DO YOU ACTUALLY DO IT AND IS IT SOMETHING THAT WE REALLY WANT TO PRIORITIZE RATHER THAN. ENHANCING YOU KNOW THE STRUCTURE THAT WE ALREADY HEALTH SO ANYWAY A LOW ENOUGH NO SHAKE YOU FOR THAT I WANT TO GO BACK TO THE COMMENT ABOUT HAVING THE INSPECTORS OR THE NUMBER OF INSPECTORS NECESSARY TO DO A THOROUGH -- RESPONSIBLE JOB OF OF INSPECTING THE CITY ELECTRICAL SIDE -- BUT OBVIOUSLY WHEN YOU LOOK AT AND USING P. GENIE IS AN EXAMPLE OF FROM WHAT WE'VE LEARNED OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS [inaudible] DAISY. THE QUALITY OF THEIR SEE WHAT WOULD EVERYONE LOOK AT THIS THEIR SAFETY EVALUATIONS THAT JUST THE QUALITY OF THEIR SYSTEM COMPARED TO ASSESS THE GENIE. SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN THERE WAS A MAJOR MAJOR DIFFERENCE THERE. WOULD THAT BE UNKNOWN TO THE P. UC WOULD THEY NOT HAVE HAD SOME. ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS A DISTINCTION HERE OR THERE COULD BE A PROBLEM WITH THE SYSTEM THAT OF COURSE GOING BACK TO THE GAS SYSTEM WE YOU KNOW THERE WERE NO. WE'LL ALARM SET WITH P. JEANNIE IN THAT SYSTEM EITHER SO I GUESS HOW DO WE WE HAVE A REGULATOR HOW DO THEY ENFORCE THE REGULATIONS ITSELF ENFORCEMENT SELF REGULATED THAN IN A WAY. ITSELF MONITORED. SO OF THE AUDITS OF THOSE THOUGH IS THAT THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU DETERMINE WHETHER THERE IS A PROBLEM AND THEY'RE NOT DOING THEIR JOB. OR DO WE HAVE TO DO WE WAIT TILL THAT. DISASTER WELL AB THEY THINK THAT THIS YOU KNOW MULTIPLE COMPONENTS TO THIS AND THERE'S A EITHER THERE IS THE THE WORK ALL KNOWING THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM MORE PROBLEMATIC OPERATOR AND THEN. THERE ARE THE LOVERS YES TO THE YOU KNOW OF WHAT YOU CAN DO IN THE REGULATORY SPACE TO GET THEM TO CHANGE THE BEHAVIOR RATE IN THOSE IT YET YOU CAN BE AWARE THAT YOU HAVE AN OPERATOR WITH ME BECAUSE ON THE PERFORMING. THAT DOESN'T ACTUALLY BE IN THAT. EVEN IF YOU HAVE THE INTENTION TO ANY USE YOUR TOOLS CORRECTLY THAT THE OPERATOR ACTUALLY RESPONDS IN THE WILL IT IN THE WAY THAT PRODUCES THE RESULT THAT YOU WANT I MEAN YOU. YOU KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE ON ON THE BUT SINCE [inaudible] HOURS EITHER OVER THOSE OPERATORS RATE THEY WERE OUR OWN ECONOMIC AND OTHER INCIDENTS OF MECHANISMS THAT YOU CAN USE BUT SOMETIMES THE FAIL RATE. AND SO YOU KNOW YOU HOW OF CERTAIN OF THEM. IT CAN OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL INCENTIVES THAT YOU CAN SEND RATE SOMETIMES THEY'RE NOT ENOUGH RATE SO YOU KIND OF HAVE TO KEEP DEVELOPING YOU TOOL BOX. IT IS THE THE IT IS A REGULATOR AS TOWARDS PRESSURES YOU CAN PORTS WELL THE REGULATED AND CITY. IN ORDER TO GET IT TO PERFORM IN SUCH A WAY THAT PRODUCES THE SOCIETAL RESULTS THAT WE WANT RATE SO I THINK THERE'S A TWO ZERO PARTS. OF THIS -- YOU KNOW TO THIS QUESTION THERE IS THE KNOWLEDGE RATE IN THE MONITORING TO KNOW HOW IS THE OPERATOR PERFORMING IN IDENTIFYING ISSUES BEFORE THE RESULT IN INCIDENTS. AND THEN THERE'S ALSO WHAT YOU CAN DO ALL AND AS YOU GET INTO SITUATIONS WHERE. YOU THIS SONG METHODS. OF ARNOLD WORKING YOU NEED TO KEEP INCREASING YOUR CAPABILITY PROBABLY IN BOTH OF THOSE DOMAINS. WAY IN IN GRAVITY TO THE NUMBER OF INSPECTORS THE THAT THE FAA FOR EXAMPLE I MEAN I DON'T THINK. THEY DON'T HAVE INSPECTORS. INSPECTING EVERY AIRPLANE THEY DON'T HAVE INSPECTORS THAT ARE OUT THERE CONSTANTLY. MONITORING WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE AIRLINES I MEAN THERE IS SELF REGULATION AND THEY HAVE INTERNAL INSPECTORS I BELIEVE THAT OUR PEOPLE FROM THE COMPANY THAT ACTUALLY TAKE THAT RESPONSIBILITY AND AND AND DO THE JOB THAT EXPECTED OF THEM AND REQUIRED OF THEM BY. THE FAA OR THE REGULATOR NAM MAYBE JUMPING OUT OF OUT OF MY REALM HERE BUT I WOULD THINK THAT'S HOW IT WOULD OPERATE. ESPECIALLY FOR THE FAA THE NRC. HAS ITS OWN PEOPLE BUT THAT THE FAA DOES USE IN EXPECTS TO HAVE SOME INSPECTION DONE BY THE COMPANIES THEMSELVES. ONE FLIGHT A CLARIFICATION MAYBE TO BE MADE HERE IS THAT. WHEN I WAS TALKING ABOUT A LOT OF INSPECTIONS? I WAS NOT NECESSARILY TALKING ABOUT PHYSICAL INSPECTIONS WERE SOMEBODY GOES OUT AND LOOKS SO ALL THE MILES OF RAIL OR THE LINE. BUT SAFETY MANAGEMENT MAN ORGANIZATIONAL MANAGEMENT INSPECTIONS WERE PEOPLE LOOK AT MAYBE THEY'LL GO IN AND SAMPLE SOME WORK PLANNING SESSIONS FOR EXAMPLE OR SIT IN ON A MEETING. AND SEE WHAT'S BEING DONE AT THE SUPERVISORY LEVEL OR SPEND THE DAY IN A CONTROL ROOM AND SEE WHAT PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY DOING AND WHAT PRESSURES THERE UNDER. AND I THINK. THERE IS THERE ARE SOME ISSUES IN SAFETY MANAGEMENT. THAT IRRESPECTIVE OF THE ASSET AND THE THE A TECHNOLOGY TYPE. ARE IMPORTANT ACROSS THOSE SYSTEMS AND PEOPLE THAT THEY KNOW WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN A SAFETY CULTURE IN TERMS OF COMMUNICATION PATTERNS. ETCETERA AND SAFETY MANAGEMENT. COULD. COULD DO THAT WITHOUT HAVING TO GO OUT AND LOOK ALL OVER THE ENTIRE GEOGRAPHY FOR EXAMPLE OF A UTILITY. DIRECTOR YOU COMFORTABLE WITH -- ESSAYS. TWO YEAR TENURE THE WORK THEY'VE DONE. AND WHERE DO YOU THINK THEY COULD EXPAND THAT OR DO A BETTER JOB OF AND BEEN FORESEEN IN BRINGING IN A SAFETY SYSTEM. MANAGEMENT TO THE UTILITIES AND WITHIN THE P. UC [inaudible] OWN. A SINGLE WAS THE HOUSE ADDED VALUE HOME. A THINK THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE THE DIALOGUE ABOUT THE SAFETY FUNCTIONS THAT WE WANT THE PC TO PLAY -- AND HOW TO STRUCTURE LONG HOME AND THIS AGAIN THERE'S DIFFERENCE WAYS THAT YOU CAN ACCOMPLISH IT YOU KNOW THEY THINK THAT THERE ARE. A COUPLE OF CHALLENGES WITH HOW -- THE CITY WAS DESIGNED THAT HAS SO SORT OF PLEA DEALT THROUGH THIS PILOT PHASE. THAT ANYTHING COULD BE HOPEFUL WHO -- RESOLVE OR OR CLARIFY. HOME ONE OF THIS THOUGH IS THE WHOLE QUESTION OF SAFETY ADVOCACY WHAT THAT MEANS. ELEMENT IN THE UC CONTEXT ADVOCACY MEANS SOMETHING VERY SPECIFIC. ELEMENT. AND THERE IS THE THE REAL GOOD REASONS FOR FOR THAT OF RATE THEY THERE IS THE HUGE. ELM EVERYTHING THE YOU KNOW THE ANY -- ORGANIZATION ANY ANY TYPE ANYTIME YOU HALL THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK IT NEEDS TO HELP THE PROCESS HOUSE WAYS TO COLLECT INFORMATION THINK THROUGH ISSUES AND RESOLVE THEM RIGHT THE P. YOU SEE HIGHS CERTAIN PROCESS AS ITS STRENGTH AND WEAKNESSES RATE. BUT ADVOCACY MEANS A VERY SPECIFIC THING AND IT HAS AN IMPORTANT ROLE. OF AND THEN EIGHT THINK WHAT HAPPENING WITH GO WITH SAY IS THAT THE SORT OF THE CAPITAL LETTER FORMAL ADVOCACY GETS COMPLETED WITH AN INFORMAL WAY YOU USE ADVOCACY IN TERMS OF A PROMOTER. IT IS THE YOU KNOW WITH SOMEBODY WHO'S A SAFETY EXPERT AND PROMOTE SAFETY IS A MOTION. AND IN THE P. YOU SEE CONTACTS IN AND IT DOES TWO THINGS AREN'T NECESSARILY THE SAME THING OR SHOULD BE THE SAME THING AND CONFLATING NUMBERS CREATING. CERTAIN ISSUES SO THAT YEAR I THINK IT KIND OF IF I CAN SEEK ONCE THE BACK -- SOMETHING THAT THE THE BACKGROUND PAPERS TALKING ABOUT AND SENATE HELLO I THINK YOU PHONE. HOW ABOUT IN YOUR OPENING COMMENTS IS THIS? QUESTION ABOUT REAP MAKING AS THE ELM IS A MECHANISM AND WHERE IT HOUSE YOU KNOW THAT THAT SORT OF THE PC FOR PRIMARY WAY OF DEALING WITH THINGS AND WAREHOUSE STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES IN THE MAY BE COMPARING IT TO THE BECAUSE I LEGISLATIVE. WAY WELL EACH YEAR. TO ME EITHER THE QC DOESN'T GENERALLY FUNCTIONS THE COURTHOUSE -- YEAR THAT IS HOW IT HAS DIFFERENT TYPES OF PROCEEDINGS AND DIFFERENT MECHANISMS A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT RULES BUT ULTIMATELY IT WAS SET UP TO ALLOW. FOUR ELM. CONSIDERATION BUT FOR ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS THAT INVOLVED IN THE ISSUES TO COME IN ARGUE THEIR POINTS AND THEN FOR A FAIR PROCESS TO EVALUATE FACTS AND THEN COME TO BALANCE DECISION THAT IS. THE CORE OF HOPE YOU SEE FUNCTIONS RATE. AND IN CERTAIN AREAS IT DOES WORK WE WILL WORK FAIRLY WELL UL LI CREEK MAKING AS AN EXAMPLE WHERE YOU HAVE A UTILITY ASKING FOR MONEY AND THEN THE REPAIR INTRAVENOUS COME AND THEN ARGUE THEIR POINTS AND THEN YOU KIND OF THAT LAND IN THE MDDLE SOMEWHERE. IT'S WORKED VERY WELL IN -- WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT RENEWABLES? BECAUSE YOU HOW OF ORGANIZED LOBBIES L. FOR SOLAR DEVELOPERS FOR EXAMPLE FOR VERY ELOQUENCE. TO ARGUE THEIR POINTS AGAIN YOU YOU HAVE A RECORD THAT'S BALANCED OR BASED ON WHICH YOU COMMISSION CAN WEIGH THE FACTS AND AND COME UP WITH SOME. DECISIONS IN THE CASE OF SAFETY THAT NATURALLY DOESN'T ARISE SO THAT IS THE NEW. THE P. YOU SEE PROCESS IN THIS IN THE CASE OF SAFETY WHETHER IT'S READ SETTING BECAUSE THEY LEGISLATOR OF WERE ANYTHING ELSE. DOZENS. IT BREAKS DOWN BECAUSE YOU DON'T HEALTH PARTIES. OUT THERE WHO ADVOCATES FOR SAFETY AND WELL IN IT THERE IS NO WAY FOR THEM TO ARISE. BECAUSE THERE'S NO ECONOMIC CONSENSUS EVERYBODY NEEDS TO SORT OF MAKE A LIVING RATE. ELEMENTS SO [inaudible] THE SAFETY ADVOCATES. YOU KNOW FOR ME AGAIN THE FORMAL POINTS OF VIEW THERE IS THIS GAP WHERE YOU DON'T HAVE ANYBODY WHO SERVE PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION INTO THE RECORD. RATE IN THE RISEN IMPORTANT FUNCTION. TO HAVE SOMEBODY DO THAT. RATE SO THAT THE RATE IS A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A DIALOGUE AND DEBATE AND THAT WAS FROM A FORMAL POINT OF VIEW OF WHAT IS A SAFETY. OFFICE OF CT ADVOCATE CAN PERFORM THIS FORMAL ADVOCACY AND I DON'T WANT TO DISCOUNT THAT AND I DO THINK THAT THAT IS A FUNCTION. THAT SQUARE -- SAY HAS DONE WELL IN AND GIVEN ADDITIONAL RESOURCES CAN DO AN EVEN BETTER JOB AT BUT IT DOESN'T SOLVE. ALL OF THESE FOR ALL OF PROBLEMS WELL WILL SHORTCOMINGS THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE IN THEIR SAFETY PARADIGM YOU KNOW IT JUST THE YOU KNOW SEE IF THE ADVOCACY ON THE RECORD IT IS A GAP. IT NEEDS TO GET FILLED IN THE WITH SAY CAN FILL IT AND IF WE CAN GIVE IT GET MORE RESOURCES I THINKING CAN DO IN A REALLY GOOD JOB. BUT THERE ARE MANY OTHER AREAS WHERE WE CURRENTLY. EL HALL OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVEMENTS. AND IT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE CASE THAT WE NEED TO LUMP EVERYTHING ON TO ALWAYS SAY TO TO SORT OF FULL BLOWN RATE. SO ELM SOME OF THE EXAMPLES. FOR THE RESEARCH AND ANALYSIS I COULDN'T AGREE MORE WITH DOCTOR SHULMAN ON THE US YOU KNOW AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED ONE OF THE BIGGEST GAPS THAT WE HAVE IN SAFETY. IS ACTUALLY IN THE IN. THE IN THE FACT THAT WE DON'T. HOW OF ANYBODY WHO IS DEDICATED TO SAFETY POLICY? ARM AND THEY KIND OF LINE THAT UP WITH RESEARCH AND ANALYSIS THAT YOU WE DON'T HAVE. STAFF OR RESOURCES OR ANYONE WHO ACTUALLY STUDIES SAFETY AND COMES UP WITH PROPOSALS AND SO AND AGAIN IT'S A DIFFERENT FUNCTION FROM ADVOCACY. RATE IT YOU KNOW WEEK IT IS AND THE YEAR WE NEED IT AND I'M TRYING TO DO THIS RIGHT NOW IN THE WILD FIRE SPACE. WHERE WE HAVE THIS IS SORT OF SB NINE A ONE RATE THAT SETS UP THE WELFARE MITIGATION PLAN THIS IS A FANTASTIC EXAMPLE OF WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT RIGHT? TO THE ITEM TO GET SET UP AS UTILITIES FILES THE PLAN IN THE AND THEN THE PC NEEDS TO EVALUATE THEM MAKE A DECISION SO UTILITY FILE THEIR PLAN. RIGHT WE'LL STOP THE WEEK COMMISSION IS DESIGNED AREN'T SET UP TO COME UP WITH A COUNTER PROPOSAL TO THIS RIGHT YOU RESPONDING TO WOULD BE UTILITIES FILED. AND THEN WAS SUPPOSED TO LOOK AT THE RECORD THAT THAT GETS THE BALL GOOD OVER THIRTY PARTIES THE JOIN THOSE PROCEEDINGS. WHEN WE WERE PLANNING FOR WORKSHOPS I SEND OUT? A REQUEST TO THE PARTIES TO SAY OKAY WE'RE GONNA HOP SOME SOME WORKSHOPS AND WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON THE DECISION MANAGEMENT. AND ALL WHO WHO AND CODED CONDUCTORS. AND I WANNA HALL OF EXPERTS. THE OWNER IN THE WORKSHOP WERE ACTUALLY HAVE EXPERTISE IN THESE TOPICS. ALL MY WHO. WE YOU KNOW WE DO SOME QUESTIONING IN DISCUSSION WITH UTILITIES DO ANY OF THE PARTIES HAVE EXPERTS. THEY DIDN'T RATE BECAUSE DORAL SPECIAL INTERESTS GROUPS LIKE FULLER OR MICHAEL GOOD DEVELOPERS OR WHATEVER WHO DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTISE IN THE US. AND THE STAFF AGAIN WE WERE NEVER SET UP. TO HAVE THAT EXPERTISE EITHER THE ROLE OF ADVISORY STAFF OF THE COMMISSION IS TO LOOK AT THE RECORD AND ALL OF THE DIFFERENT INFORMATION THE PARTIES A SUBMITTED AND HOPE THE JUDGE MAKES SENSE OF THE RECORD. IT'S NOT TO DEVELOP OUR OWN RECORD THE RIGHT NOW IT'S A COMPLETE GAP BREAK SO I MEAN WE KIND OF DID THE THE BEST WE COULD WITH THIS FIRST ROUND BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I'M ASKING FOR IT JUST CAME OUT OF ANOTHER HEARING FOR BUDGET FOR ME REALIZE IS. FOR CONSULTING MONEY SO WE CAN ACTUALLY P. SOMEONE'S WHO'LL COME IN AND BRING THIS EXPERTISE. TO DEVELOP SOME OF THE CRITERIA FOR WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLANS AT THE WE CAN USE KIND OF AS A STAFF PROPOSAL. THAT IS SOMETHING OTHER THAN THE JUST THE UTILITY POINTS OF VIEW THEN THEN YOU CAN SORT OF USE AS A BASIS. FOR EACH YEAR OLD FROM. FOR FOR HELPING THE EAGLE. THE DIRECTION IN WHICH WE WANT THE UTILITIES TO GO IN IN THE VALUATION CRITERIA BUT THIS EXAMPLE THAT WAS STRUGGLING WITH THEM WILD FIRES AT THE PLACE ACROSS THE BOARD RATE. SO IT UNLESS YOU KNOW WE NEED TO IN ORDER FOR US TO MAKE -- IMPROVEMENTS IN SAFETY OVER LONG TERM WE HAVE TO START ADDRESSING THIS MUCH EARLIER THAN WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW YOU KNOW GO ON THE AS YOU KNOW THE QUITE A FEW THESE INCIDENTS AND EVERY SINGLE TIME THAT SOMETHING BAD HAPPENS I DON'T KNOW IT'S LIKE. IN SAFETY EVERYBODY ALWAYS GOES TO ENFORCEMENT AND COMPLIANCE AS THE SOLUTION RATE. AND THAT HAS AN IMPORTANT ROLE DON'T GET ME WRONG BUT WE DON'T DO THAT IN OTHER AREAS YOU KNOW WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO PROMOTE YOU KNOW RENEWABLES OR SOMETHING ELSE SOMEBODY JUMPS TO ENFORCEMENT AND COMPLIANCE IS THE SOLUTION YOU START POLICY RATE. AND HOW BEING YOU KNOW AN ARTICULATION OF WHAT YOU ACTUALLY TRYING TO ACHIEVE AND THEN SAFETY WERE ALWAYS STARTING AT THE BACK THE FILMING. THE DOES REGULATIONS ALREADY TAKE YOU KNOW EXIST AND SO AGAIN I THINK TO JUST TROOPS ARE AT NO AT THEY WON THE LONG. ANSWER HERE BUT I DON'T KNOW FOR WITH STATE NEEDS TO KIND OF SOLD ALL OF THOSE PROBLEMS I THINK THEY'VE DONE WELL ON THE FORMAL ADVOCACY PIECE IN THE SHOULD CONTINUE TO DO THAT AND WE SHOULD EVALUATE HOW TO CLOSE. SOME OF THOSE OTHER GAPS AROUND RESEARCH ANALYSIS AND JUST POLICY DEVELOPMENTS AND ALWAYS SEE MAY OR MAY NOT BE LIKE THE THE PRIMARY WAY OF ACHIEVING NOT. DO THAT BUT HOW DO YOU SEE THEM IT IN ANOTHER ROLE I MEAN. TAKING MORE. A MORE ACTIVE ROLE IN LOOKING AT THE UTILITIES AND LOOKING AT IN NOT JUST DURING RATE CASES BUT IN [inaudible] NO. LOOKING IT'S BEING THAT SAFETY ADVOCATE IN ADVOCATE IN WHATEVER HOWEVER WE WANTED TO FIND IT BUT NOT JUST AS AN ADVOCATE IN A RAPE CASE BUT AN ADVOCATE IN TRYING TRYING TO PROMOTE THAT. AND ALSO SAFETY WITHIN THE CPUC TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT CULTURE IS IS THERE AND AS WE KNOW THAT. THAT HASN'T BEEN THE CASE IN THE PAST. YEAR I THINK THAT ELEMENT THERE IS CONFLICT OVER HAVING THE FORMAL SAFETY ADVOCATES WHO ALSO HAS A FUNCTION WITHIN THE COMMISSION. OF ME. BECAUSE WHEN. YOU KNOW WHEN THEY ARE IN THEIR FORMAL ADVOCACY ROLE OF THE ORG ALMOST LIKE AN EXTERNAL PARTY AND HARMING THE SAME PEOPLE SORT OF TELL THE COMMISSION WHAT TO DO AND HOW TO DO ITS ROLE AND THEN BE A PARTY TO THE CASE THAT THE COMMISSION DECIDES IT'S AN IT'S AN INHERENT CONFLICT. YOU KNOW WE DON'T DO THAT THEN RATE LIKE WHAT RATE OR IT DOESN'T TELL ENERGY DIVISION HALL TO DO ALL YOUR BILL RATE MAKING ON ONE HAND WHAT'S ALL THE COMMISSIONERS OF HALL TOOL YOU KNOW. SORT OF THE VALUE IT RATES AND THEN ALSO ACT AS A PARTY IN COMMISSIONS PROCEEDING SO A THINK I DON'T SEE A CONFLICT IN. A WITH SAY. BEING A LARGER ADVOCATES IN THE UTILITIES SPACE AND ENGAGING WITH UTILITIES BOTH YOU KNOW IN THE CONTEXT ALL OF YOU THE LITIGATION WITHIN. L. EITHER AS AN ADVOCATE AND THEN ALSO CAN OF GENERALLY PROMOTING ELM YOU'LL SAFETY YOU THOUGH CULTURE AND AND THINGS LIKE THAT. A BOY A DO YOU THINK THAT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO BE AN INDEPENDENT SAFETY ADVOCATES WERE YOUR ROLE IS TO BE THE LEADING GAUGE BY JUST. BY THE THE NATIONAL FORMAL ADVOCACY. WITHIN THE COMMISSION PROCEEDING AND ALSO HOW OF THIS KIND OLD. TELLING THE COMMISSION HELL TO DO ITS JOB FUNCTION EIGHT THING THAT SHOULD GET DE CONFLICTED IN MY OPINION PUT IT INTO THE THIS USUALLY HAVE THE SAFETY ACTION PLAN WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO THAT IS THAT. ELEMENT GOT REPLACED BY THE SAFETY STRATEGIC DIRECTIVES -- THE EITHER YOU JUST DO THIS TOO MANY COMPETING KIND OF WELL L. PARADIGM SO WE HAVE THE SAFETY ACTION PLANS BEFORE THE COMMISSION ONCE WITH THE STRATEGIC DIRECT OF EXERCISE. AND NOW HOW OLD. WE HOW ALL OF THIS THIS STRATEGIC DIRECTORS THAT HAVE BEEN ADOPTED BY THE QUé WE HAVE THE SAFETY VISION THE SAFETY OF THE STRATEGIC DIRECTOR OF AND THEN THE MECHANISM THROUGH WHICH THE COMMISSION EVALUATES. THE PERFORMANCE OF PC STAFF IN FULFILLING THAT STRATEGIC DIRECTIVES THERE ISN'T A SEPARATE SAFETY ACTION PLAN. TO WHOSE ACTUALLY WORKING ON DEVELOPING SOME LONG TERM. YOU KNOW SAFETY VISION WITHIN THE P. UC IS THAT IN THAT DIRECTIVE. FOR IS ANYONE DOING THAT TODAY. YES A A THINK THAT YOU KNOW THE IT HAPPENS A DIFFERENT LEVELS FLOW THERE ARE. THIS LEAF TEA THE STRATEGIC DIRECTIVE PROCESS IS REALLY. WHERE THE COMMISSIONERS GET TO COMMUNICATE WITH STUFF RATE BECAUSE THE GOOD THE DIRECTOR OF THE SET BY THE COMMISSIONERS AS THE BODY AND THE SAFETY DIRECTIVES PROCESS IS THE THE THE FEEDBACK MECHANISM ELSE TO HOW THE THOUGHT OFFICE FULL. OUT THOSE OBLIGATIONS AND WHERE THE COMMISSIONER C. L. OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVEMENTS AND AND SO ON YOU KNOW AND THEN THAT HAPPENS AT DIFFERENT LEVELS. SO L. -- IT OPENS FIRMS ALL OF IT HOW IT'S IMPLEMENTED BY STAFF IN WHAT THE SAFETY VISION IS FOR THE AGENCY -- IN MY VIEW THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR ALSO MONTHLY OWNS THAT'S AS THE HAD ALL OF THE OF THE COMMISSION. ELEMENT AND THE DEPUTY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR FOR SAFETY IN THE FORCE ONE POLICY IS. THE PERSON WHO IS SORT OF THE PRIMARY. ADVISER TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR ON MATHS AND IS THE PERSON WHO WAS SORT OF RESPONSIBLE FOR FOR DEVELOPING THAT UNIFIED ELM. VISION AND THEN THE INSURING THAT OLD EIGHT DIFFERENT GROUPS THAT ARE INVOLVED IN CARRYING IT OUT THERE ACTUALLY YOU KNOW PERFORMING THAT FUNCTION. THERE BEEN SOME CHANGES IN YOU JUST GET OF REFERRING TO THE THE STRUCTURE OF THE P. UC AND HOW THINGS FIT IN THERE BEEN SOME RECENT CHANGES -- AND IS A IS NOW UNDER. VIA A CD IS THAT CORRECT NO NO THERE'S STILL SEPARATES. DIVISION ELEMENTS SO THE END WE ARE WORKING THROUGH THE DETAILS OF HOW. CAN OF TO FUNCTIONALLY SPLIT ITS BUT THE ELM. THE VISION IS FOR THE FOR THE L.. FIFTY ANON FORSMAN FUNCTIONS THE FULL ON THE ONE DEPUTY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND THEN YOU HOLDEN DEPENDING TO UNITS UNDERNEATH THAT SO SAFETY LOW FORSMAN DIVISION. WITH DIESEL DIVISION WITH THE DIRECTOR OFFICE OF SAFETY ADVOCATES IS A SEPARATE DIVISION WITH THE WRONG DIRECTOR. AND THE THE ROLE OF THE DEPUTY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR SAFETY IN THE FIRST MONTH IS TO MAKE SURE THAT ACROSS ALL THE FUNCTIONS FROM POLICY MAKING. YOU KNOW THE ADVOCACY ADVISORY ENFORCEMENTS THAT EACH OF THOSE ELEMENTS FUNCTIONS ULTIMATELY IN THE EVERYTHING MAKE SCHOOL HE SO -- COHESIVE SENSE BUT IS THE IDEAS THAT THE EACH UNIT WOULD STILL HAVE COMPLETED THE PENDANT SO THERE IS NO YES ALWAYS SAY WOULD NOT BE ABSORBED BY SIXTEEN THE HORSEMEN DIVISION BECAUSE OF THE FROM FUNCTIONS AND ROLES FOR FALL. HE AND HE IS. HOW IS -- IS A DIFFERENT FROM -- THE RISK ASSESSMENTS SAFETY ADVISER. WELL AGAIN THE MAIN THE MAIN THEIR FRIENDS IS IN. THE FUNCTIONAL ROLE WITHOUT THE CASEY -- IS THE I THINK THE CORE ALL OF THE OF WHAT THE ALWAYS SAY WILL SET UP TO ADDRESS WAS THE GAP THAT THERE WAS NO FORMAL INTERVENOR. IN BRIEFCASES SPECIFICALLY BUT THEN OTHER PROCEEDINGS WALL THE ADVOCATE. FOR SIXTY RISK ASSESSMENTS WAS NEVER YOU THAT WAS ALWAYS WORKING IN THE ADVISORY FUNCTION AND BOTH. ARE NECESSARY BECAUSE YOU NEED STAFF TO SUPPORT COMMISSIONERS AND THE L. O. IN ADMINS SHOULD LAW JUDGE. IN THE IN THE ANALYSIS OF THE RECORD DRAFTING OF DECISIONS CREATING STUFF PROPOSALS THINGS LIKE THAT AND YOU NEED SOMEBODY ON THE RECORD WHO ACTUALLY. HAS A POSITION AND DOES A TO TWO DIFFERENT NEEDS AND BOTH OF THEM HAVE TO BE -- NO MATTER PACEY THE THE END OF IT THE COUPLE MORE THINGS HERE IN IN -- WE CAN WRAP UP BUT WANTED TO CONTINUE KIND OF A DISCUSSION ON ON THE CULTURE -- NOT WITHIN AN ORGANIZATION AS IMPORTANT AS THAT IS BUT THE CULTURE BETWEEN THE REGULATED UTILITIES AS WE SEE IT AND THEIR REGULATOR -- IN WHAT WHAT CULTURE KINDA DRIVES SAFETY WHAT WHAT. HOW CAN WE? TO THAT POINT TO WHERE THERE IS A A SAFETY. CULTURE OF THAT IN SAFETY IS PART OF THAT CULTURE HOW HOW DOES THAT -- HOWEVER THAT THAT WORK. YEAH. AS USUAL -- SO THAT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION. AND LIKE MANY QUESTIONS THAT SO EASY ANSWER BUT I THINK THE THE ISSUE IS THAT. SAFETY IS A ONGOING PROCESS THAT IS -- PENETRATES THROUGH MANY LAYERS. AND YOU KNOW I THINK -- LIZA BETTER REYES REALLY INTERESTING POINT WHEN SHE TALKED ABOUT WELL THE SAFETY THROUGH MANY DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH SAFETY THAT'S CERTAINLY TRUE -- BUT I THINK THAT -- SAFETY IS SPECIAL I MEAN SHE'S RIGHT THERE YOU DON'T HAVE A SEPARATE. ADVOCATE FOR SAFETY ORGANIZATIONALLY AND THERE'S A REASON FOR THAT AND PART OF IT IS BECAUSE A LOT OF THE SAFETY CULTURE IS INTERNALIZED IN INDIVIDUALS IT'S NOT A FORMAL STRUCTURE. IT PEOPLE INTERNALIZE IT AND IT BECOMES SORT OF A COLLECTIVE GOOD. AND RARELY DO YOU FIND INDIVIDUAL GROUPS ARGUING FOR A COLLECTIVE GOOD IT'S MOST OFTEN A SPECIALIZED. I I THINK YOU HAVE TO TREAT SAFETY IS SPECIAL AND I THINK YOU WOULD ASO HAVE TO SAY. SAFETY ADVOCACY CAN'T BE JUST LIKE [inaudible] RATE ADVOCACY. RENEWABLE ADVOCACY IT'S A SPECIAL PROPERTY. AND SO -- WHEN WE'VE SEEN IT IN OPERATION? IT GOES ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE INDIVIDUAL IDENTITY OF PEOPLE WORKING IN SPECIFIC TASKS. WHO BASICALLY THINK ABOUT THE RAMIFICATIONS OF WHAT THEY'RE DOING FOR OTHERS SYSTEM RISKS IN AN ORGANIZATION? WHO AYE I WOULD USE THE USE THIS EXAMPLE I WAS INTERVIEWING SOMEBODY A CHEMIST IN -- POWER PLANT NUCLEAR POWER PLANT. AND HE'S SITTING IN HIS OFFICE IN IS A NOISE IS WHAT IS THAT NOISE I NEVER HEARD THAT BEFORE HE RUSHES OUT OF THE ROOM AND LEAVES ME. I'M JUST SITTING THERE ANY COMES I HAD TO KNOW WHAT IT WAS. HE COULD NOT BE THE PERSON HE WAS WITHOUT RUNNING OUT TO FIND OUT WHAT THAT WHAT THAT WAS. AND SO THE IT'S IT'S A STATE OF MIND THAT INDIVIDUALS HAVE FOR THAT THAT'S THE CULTURE THE DRIVE SAFETY EYES AND I BELIEVE IT GOES THROUGH ALL OF THE LIGHT LAYERS WE CALL PEOPLE. RELIABILITY PROFESSIONS WE SAW THEM IN A LITTLE HUGE NUMBER OF INFRASTRUCTURES THAT WE LOOKED AT WHO SAW. THEIR RESPONSIBILITY FOR RELIABILITY AND SAFETY AS BIGGER THAN THEIR JOB. THEY WOULD GO BEYOND THEIR JOB. THEY WOULD SEE A SYSTEM LEVEL RISK WHERE THEIR JOB DIDN'T CALL FOR THEM TO EVEN. WORRY ABOUT THOSE KINDS OF RISKS SO IT'S IT'S A PROCESS OF PEOPLE -- HAVING THIS IDENTIFICATION -- HAVING A RESTLESS. DRIVE TO MAKE THINGS BETTER FROM A SAFETY. THAT THEY HAVEN'T THOUGHT OF EVERYTHING NEVER ALWAYS WORRIED ABOUT BEING COMPLACENT. AND THAT THAT KIND OF UP PROCESS. IS A CRITICAL ELEMENT IN THE SAFETY CULTURE AND IT'S NOT EASY TO JUST CREATE THAT -- BUT THAT'S WHAT WHAT WE SEE IT SAFETY ISN'T JUST NEW TECHNOLOGY AND NEW SYSTEMS IT'S THAT THAT PROCESS AND THAT'S BEEN SO DISTINCTIVE. IN THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT THAT WE'VE LOOKED AT SO. AND THAT THAT THESE RELIABILITY PROFESSIONALS AS WE'D TURN COPS SAW BEYOND THEIR OWN ORGANIZATIONS WE WENT TO THE CONTRA COSTA WATER DISTRICT WHICH WAS FROM OUR STANDPOINT A REALLY WELL MANAGED HIGH RELIABILITY UNIT. AND WHEN THEY STARTED TO TALK ABOUT THEIR WATER PROCESSING THEY SAW THROUGH THE LENS OF THEIR CLIENTS. IT WASN'T JUST WE GOT TO GET THE STUFF OUT THERE THEY THOUGHT THIS IF WE SCREW UP HERE I KNOW WHAT IT'S GOING TO DO WITH THE CITY OF X.. AND SO THE I DON'T KNOW QUITE. HOW YOU CREATE THAT BUT I JUST THINK IT'S DIFFERENT THAT'S WHY WHEN I THINK OF SAFETY ADVOCACY I DON'T THINK OF IT IN THOSE FORMAL TERMS I DON'T THINK IT'S PRODUCTIVE? TO ASSUME THAT THE OS A WILL SIMPLY COUNTER. OTHER OTHER ADVOCATES FOR OTHER THINGS IN PROCEEDINGS IF THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAS TO BE UNDERSTOOD TO BE SPECIAL. AND IN THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE REALLY GOOD IT IS SPECIAL PARTLY BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE SO WORRIED ABOUT. THE HAZARDS THERE'S A PUBLIC DREAD THAT THE MAKES THEM. YOU KNOW TAKE THIS ON BECAUSE OF THAT THAT KIND OF DREAD BUT UP IN THE HOW DO YOU BALANCE THE FACT THAT IF YOU HAVE A UTILITY AND AND IF FOR UTILITIES NEGLIGENT AND AND THE REGULATOR FINDS OUT FINDS THEM PUNISHES THEM IN SOME WAY. FOR THE REST OF YOUR AND AND AND CORRECTS THAT -- HE DID. WOULD THAT IT HAS THAT LED TO A CAñADA LEAD. TO KNOW KIND OF A DISTRUST IN AND A COMMUNICATION AND AND TRUST ISSUE WILL THE THE REGULATOR ON NEVER FIND OUT IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT NEVER GONNA TELL THEM WITH THE SAFETY IT FIND AND HOW I THINK I KNOW THAT IN THEIR EYES ARE OVAL THING OF THE FUTURE. HE WAS. WAS CRITICIZED FOR THE FACT THAT THEY DID NOT FIND AND DID NOT TAKE IT SERIUSLYA NUMBER OF YEARS AGO WITH THAT THAN THEY WERE TRUST IN THE UTILITIES. TO TO DO THE JOB FIND THE PROBLEM AND FIX THE PROBLEM REPORT THE PROBLEM AND THEN YOU'RE OKAY AND THE FINE DIDN'T SEEM TO WORK THE FINE IS A PROCESS OF RETRIBUTIVE. JUSTICE. IT IS NOT A PROCESS OF RESTORED INITIAL SOLVE THE PROBLEM TOGETHER. AND MOST -- THE REGULATORS WERE TALKING ABOUT. DON'T SEEM TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM WITH THEIR REGULATE PEOPLE I WANT TO GO BACK IF YOU. DON'T MIND THE SOMETHING YOU SAID ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES AGO WHERE I THINK YOU SOLVE THE PROBLEMS THAT WORK WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. AND LET'S SEE IF I CAN GET A RIDE IF I DON'T GET A RIGHT TO YOU CORRECT ME BACK HE SAID. YEAH YOU NEED MORE RESOURCES THAT'S ONE THING. TO DO. WHERE YOU ARE WHEN THE CPUC IS IT YOU HAVE TO SIGN BUT THE TELL SORRY? IN THEM. THE TWO WHERE THE BREAK COME OUT AND HAVE DIFFERENT PEOPLE DO THE MORE HAVE PEOPLE DO THEM WHO HAVE. A KNOWLEDGE THAT RELATES TO THE OTHER GROUP GROUP BAY HAS NOT ONLY TO RELEASE TO BE OR WHATEVER BUT YOU NEED TO DEVELOP -- AT IT WELL INVOICE AVOIDING CONFLICT AND ENCOURAGING INTERDEPENDENCE I THINK THAT'S WHAT I HEARD YOU SAY. IN NOT THAT QUITE LANGUAGE BUT IS NOT YOUR LAST DISCUSSION BUT THE ONE BEFORE THAT. IN EVERY ORGANIZATION THAT'S GOING TO BE -- SAFE. THAT'S SO THEY NEED TO DO. IT AM I AYE. IF YOU DON'T MIND I USE THAT MY NEXT PAPER. BECAUSE I HAVEN'T HEARD REALLY SAID LIKE THAT BUT THAT'S ESSENTIALLY WHAT THE REGULATOR AND THE REGULATE TV. YOU DON'T NEED NEED TO DO IN THIS ALL KINDS OF REGULATIONS THERE'S REGULAR I'VE WATCHED A LOT OF REGULATION THE MILITARY THAT NO ONE WOULD CALL REGULATION. BUT THAT THEY DO CALL PROBLEM SOLVING. AND SO I IT'S I FOR THAT DAY I GET ARE FOR RIGHT THERE AND THAT'S KIND OF WHAT YOU NEED TO DO FROM THERE WHAT EVERYBODY NEEDS. TO FIND THAT THE TASK. FIND THE ONES THAT THE MIX A LITTLE BIT -- IF YOU GOT THE RIGHT PLAYERS THAT'S ALWAYS A PROBLEM ARM IN THEM -- WORRY ABOUT WHAT WHETHER YOU GOT THREE ORGANIZATIONS OR ONE ORGANIZATION OR HALF AN ORGAN IT DOESN'T MATTER. BUT WORRY ABOUT PUTTING THOSE TASKS INTO A MIX WHERE YOU HAVE -- ABILITY TO AGREE IT IN A SET OF TAX EL AND THE DESIRE TO INTEGRATE AMONG ALL OF THEM. AND THAT'S I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE CRUX OF THE PROBLEM. IS BUT IF YOU DESIGN A CULTURE WITH THE PUNITIVE ASPECT LIKE THAT YOU JUST MENTIONED. I I'VE SEEN IT DONE AND SO IS PAUL I'M SURE YOU HAVE. TO IT JUST GOES AWRY. I AM VERY RAPIDLY YOU HAVE A OWN. SURE AND THE I AGREE WITH THE WHAT YOU SAID SO -- YEAH. YEAH I I'M NOT I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE IF THAT WAS A SO YOU DON'T WOULD THOUGH BUT I SAID PREVIOUSLY BUT I THINK AT THE LINES SO WITH THE WITH THIS BEING THE WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF WILL WE'RE ALL TALKING ABOUT. DO NOT HAVE FEWER OF YOU DID TERMS OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE THE REGULATED AND CITY AND THE THE REGULATOR OF THE UTILITIES AND IF YOU SEE IN THIS CASE -- A COOP KEEP GOING BACK TO FUNCTIONS AND ROLES I DON'T THINK IT'S A SINGLE ANSWER FOR THE FOR THE AEGIS YOUR SINGLE RELATIONSHIP. OF A AYE AND ITO. EIGHT BIG DOCTOR SHULMAN. IN I A L.. I AGREE AND AND AND KIND OF DISAGREE AT THE SAME TIME SO THEY YOU KNOW THEY THEY THINK THAT IN TERMS OF CULTURE AND AND ADVOCATING FOR SAFETY. AND ALL OF THOSE ELEMENTS. EITHER WERE WE ARE IN AGREEMENT BUT THEN THERE ARE ALSO DETAILS OF HOW ORGANIZATIONS WORK AND THERE'S PROCESS SEES AND THERE'S METHODS RATE AND FORMAL ADVOCACY IS ONE OF THEM RATE. SOMEBODY'S GOT TO DO IT SO WHATEVER YOU CALL IT WE CAN CALL IT BEING AN INTERVENOR INSTEAD OF ADVOCACY RAID BUT THERE ARE. YOU THIS WAY IS THAT WE YOU KNOW FORMAL RELATIONSHIPS THAT WE HOW THE TO REGULATED AND CITIES AND THE REGULATOR AND IS DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS WITHIN THE SORT OF SAFETY PARADIGM. AND YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE TO WE SHOULDN'T HOW OF ALL PEOPLE DOING ALL OF THOSE THINGS AND FOR FILLING EVERY SINGLE FUNCTION. SO IF YOU HOW OF INSPECTOR WORK FORCE RATE WHO'S GOING OUT THERE AND DOING KIND OF BOOTS ON THE GROUND INSPECTION OF AN INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S A CERTAIN SKILL SET THEN THEY SHOULD HAVE A CERTAIN RELATIONSHIP. WITH THE REGULAR WITH THE AND CITY WHICH INFRASTRUCTURE THERE INSPECTING RATED. L. OF THE SHOULD OF YOU WILL BE ABLE TO COORDINATE WITH THE HOME RAISE ISSUES THAT THEY SEE IN THE FEEL BE ABLE TO ASK QUESTIONS. IT YOU KNOW AND THEN. IF THE YOU KNOW FIND VIOLATIONS TO DOCUMENT THEM APPROPRIATELY RATE. THEN YOU HALL OF THE INVESTIGATIVE FUNCTIONS INSIDE OF AUDITING FUNCTIONS AND EITHER YOU THE RAILS UNTIL WE YOU KNOW HALL OF ABSOLUTE PERFECTION IN THE SYSTEM. YOU'RE GOING TO SEE ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS THE PLACE AND THEY THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT YOU KNOW EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOT THE TOOL THAT YOU ALWAYS WANT TO GO TO AS YOUR ONLY METHOD. OF ASSURING SAFETY IT IS A TOOL THAT NEEDS TO BE IN THE REGULATORS TOOLBOX AND WHEN YOU HEALTH STAFF. WHO ARE IN THAT ENFORCEMENT CAPACITY AND ARE DOING THE INVESTIGATING AND A SAFETY SHARON'S FUNCTION YOU KNOW THERE MAKES SENSE TO HOBBES SOME MORE ADVERSARIAL RELATIONSHIP AND MAYBE A LITTLE BIT OF DISTANCE YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE IN THE% MIDDLE OF AN INVESTIGATION AND THE PENALTY PHASE THAT PROBABLY ISN'T? THE PLACE WHERE YOU WANT TO HARLEM VERY CLOSE RELATIONSHIP AND BE DOING. YO COLLABORATIVE BRAINSTORMING WITH THE AND CITY THAT YOU ARE YOU KNOW ASSURING COMPLIANCE OFTEN HOLDING ACCOUNTABLE FOR SOMETHING THAT WENT WRONG RATE. BUT IT'S WOULD WITH TALKING ABOUT THINGS LIKE POLICY DEVELOPMENTS. AND YOU KNOW DEVELOPING L. SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESSING THE WILDFIRE CHALLENGE YES A THINK BY IN THAT ONTEXT IS VERY APPROPRIATE SO HALL OF OPEN COMMUNICATION. AND IS YOUR BILL STUB WAS CLOSE RELATIONSHIPS OF WORK COLLABORATIVELY AND BRING IN DIFFERENT EXPERTS OF BOUNCE IDEAS RATE AND SO TO ME WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SAFETY FUNCTION AT YOU GET IN AND THE ROLE OF THE REGULATOR IT ISN'T JUST ONE THING. I THINK WE HAVE TO BREAK IT DOWN IN SCHOOL THESE DIFFERENT AREAS AND TALK ABOUT WHAT IS APPROPRIATE. IN WHICH CASE YOU DEL AND SEEING FOR YOU KNOW SAFETY CULTURE WITHIN THE P. YOU SEE YOU KNOW THERE ARE ALSO WITH GLEE. YOU KNOW YOU THE EXPECTATIONS FOR NEW STAFF WHO PERFORM. AUDITS OF THE UTILITY SYSTEM FOR SAFETY AND SOMEBODY WHO WORKS IN THE WATER DIVISION THAT JUST DOESN'T RATE MAKING FOR WATER RATES LIKE THEY'RE GONNA HAVDE YOU THOSE YES SAFETY SHOULD BE ON TOP OF EVERYBODY'S MIND. BUT WHAT WE WANT THOSE PEOPLE TO DO IS VERY DIFFERENT RATE AND I AND SO I ALSO MONTHLY. DO YOU THINK THAT AT LEAST WHERE I A CANDLE SET A DATE I FIND IT USEFUL TO BREAK THIS QUESTION DOWN A LITTLE BIT MORE AND NOT TALK ABOUT IT JUST AS A SORT OF AGENCY ON COMPANY LEVEL. WITH THE VERY. VERY GOOD -- YOU KEEP GETTING BACK TO THE THE ISSUE OF THE YOU KNOW SEPARATING SAFETY OUT OF THE FEW SEE INTO A SEPARATE. ENTITY OF SOME TYPE OR AGENCY HOW -- IF THERE WERE. RECOMMENDATIONS MADE BY THAT AGENCY TO THE P. UC OR TWO I AM STRUGGLING WITH HOW THAT WOULD WORK. AND WHETHER THEY WOULD BE MARGINALIZED IN SOME WAY OR OR IGNORED OR JUST WOULDN'T BE. WOULDN'T FIT INTO THE THE KIND OF THE THE CONVERSATION I GUESS WITHIN THE PC AND AND MAYBE THAT'S THE BENEFIT WITH HAVING OSAGE PART OF THE ORGANIZATION TODAY. VERSUS HAVING A SEPARATE AGENCY AND AND I THINK READY MADE VERY GOOD POINTS ABOUT. WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO CREATE A DIFFERENT EDGE AS A SEPARATE AGENCY WITH THIS OR A DIFFERENT DEPARTMENT HOWEVER WOULD BE DONE IT WOULD BE A MASSIVE UNDERTAKING? AND THEN WHERE DO YOU DRAW THE LINES WITHIN THAT SO IT DID SOMETHING TO HAVE ANY THOUGHTS AND LEFT IN MAYBE DIRECTOR IF YOU WANNA GO FIRST AND THEN GONNA GO BACK TO FUNCTIONS AGAIN RATE ALONG WHICH FUNCTIONS WE TALKING ABOUT ALL SAFETY FUNCTIONS OF YOU THOUGH OR A SUBSET OF THE YOU KNOW I THINK IF YOU WANTED TO JUST SPIN OFF ADVOCACY FORMAL ADVOCACY. HOME KIND OF HOW WE HOW OF WITH THE ELVES. GO WITH THE PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE LAURIE ALL EITHER THAT'S ONE MODEL BUT THAT'S A VERY SO THAT'S ONE VERY SPECIFIC FUNCTION FORMAL ADVOCACY RATE. IF YOU WERE IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TAKING YOU KNOW LET'S SAY ALMOST EVERYTHING OUT OF THE P. YOU SEE FROM POLICY MAKING ROLE WE THROW TO ENFORCEMENT BOOTS ON THE GROUND ADVOCACY YOU KNOW AND CREATING A NEW AGENCY THAT DOES ALL OF THE SAFETY FUNCTIONS. L. YOU KNOW THERE IS YOU KNOW YOU CAN HAVE A CONVERSATION AROUND THAT BUT THERE'S YOU KNOW EVERY TIME I SORT OF PLAY AROUND WITH THIS YOU STILL END UP WITH. THE COMMISSION MEETING TO PERFORM A CERTAIN SAFETY FUNCTION AND MEETING TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S FUNCTION IS STAFFED SO. IT YOU KNOW EVEN IF YOU SEE ALL OF THE ENFORCEMENT OUT OVER THE P. YOU SEE RATE LEGISLATORS THAT THERE'S AN EXAMPLE IN U. HAUL THE SEPARATE WORK FOR SOMEWHERE ELSE AND THE FOR AN AGENCY IN CALIFORNIA DOESN'T REALLY MATTER TO DOES INSPECTIONS ON ITS. IN THE SIXTIES FRIENDS FUNCTION ONCE WE FIND AN ISSUE THE NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT IF YOU SAY TO THREATEN FINE JUDICATA SOMEHOW RATE. IT ALSO WITH THE COMES BACK TO THE P. U. C. L. I END. YOU -- TO IN ORDER TO ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING WITH US YOU KNOW THE P. YOU SEE STILL NEEDS TO HALL OF ABILITY. TO ACT ON IT SO L. U. YOU STILL SORT OF NEEDS IS FULL OF LIGHT -- THAT ASPECT OF IT AND THEN YOU CAME OVER END UP WITH THE SAME PROBLEM OVER AND OVER AGAIN THAT BITE SEEKING SAFETY OUT OF THE P. YOU SEE YOU SENDING THE MESSAGE TO THE AGENCY THAT THIS IS NO LONGER YOUR PRIMARY FUNCTION THAT WE HELPING SOMEBODY ELSE WAS GOING. TO BE DOING THIS JOB. BUT THEN YET WHEN THE ISSUE COM DID DID THE CHICKEN COMES T RULES THAT THE P. YOU SEE YOU WANT THE PC TO PRAY OR IT'S A SAFETY BUT YOU JUST DE FUNDED. THE FUNCTION OF THE PC SO YOU KNOW EIGHT THINK YOU KIND OF RUN ON THE RUN INTO THOSE TYPES OF ISSUES JUST PRACTICALLY SPEAKING. BUT AGAIN IT I THINK IF YOU'RE JUST FOCUSING ON THE PUBLIC ADVISORS OFFICE I WOULD SAY A SLUR ON THE THE ON THE THE OFFICE OF SAFETY ADVOCATES. HELLO IN THE IDEAL -- OF YOU KNOW SHOULD IT REPORTS BASICALLY THROUGH THE P. UC'S EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OR SHOULD IT GET SORT OF SPUN OUT. ALL I WOULD SAY THAT IN TERMS OF THE FORMAL ADVOCACY IN ADVOCATING A PROCEEDINGS. THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER WHERE THEY LIVE WELL AS LONG AS THEY'RE YOU KNOW ALLOWED TO INTERVENE. IN PROCEEDINGS AND BE YEAR OLD SORT OF FREE TO EXPRESS THEIR OPINIONS WHICHEVER WAY THEY WANT WHICH I HAVE NOT HEARD OF THAT EVER OF THAT BEING AN ISSUE. YOU KNOW I'VE NOT HEARD THAT REYES THAT YOU POINT THAT THE ISSUE RIGHT NOW WITH -- WITH STAYS IN THE FIELD AT THE CON ADVOCATE FOR SAFETY BECAUSE OF THE VIEW ISN'T WELCOME BECAUSE THE REPORTS TO THE PC STRUCTURE. ALL UNITS NOT WITH THE ISSUE A TRYING TO SAW WOULD SAY THAT INDEPENDENCE IS THE SOLUTION BUT THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE THE PRIMARY PROBLEM. I THINK THE ISSUE WITH YOU KNOW THE HOME ADVOCATING FOR SAFETY WITHIN THE PC AND SORT OF PROMOTING THE SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM WHILE BEING AN OUTSIDE AND CITY THAT DOESN'T REPORT TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR. YOU KNOW YOU CREATE THIS WAY FOR CREATION OF RESPONSIBILITY THAT YOU KNOW IF THEY RECOMMEND CERTAIN MEASURES FOR THE PC TO TAKE. IN THE PC THAN THE HOUSE TWO OPTIONS RIGHT THE EITHER JUST DOES EXACTLY WHAT THE ALWAYS SAY SAYS. AND THEN THINGS STILL GO BAD THE PC WILL GOAL WHAT. WAS THEY TOLD US DO IT WILL WIN DOING WHATEVER WE BEING TOLD SO. YOU KNOW IT'S THEIR FAULT. OR THEY DECIDE TO SORT OF ACT DIFFERENTLY FROM WHAT WAS SAY IS SUGGESTING. RATE BUT THEN YOUR AGAIN YOUR SEVERAL WHO WHEN YOU WHEN YOU HAVE ISSUES WHEN YOU WANT TO KNOW LIKE WHAT IS THE AGENCY DOING AND WHO DO YOU POINTS WAS BEING REALLY RESPONSIBLE YOU THE KIND OF DON'T KNOW OLD KIND OF WHERE TO GO. SO YOU THINK. ZERO ALSO THE YOU CAN MAKE IT WORK BOTH WAYS BUT I WOULD KIND OF KEEP GOING BACK TO WHICH FUNCTIONS WITH TALKING ABOUT BEING OUTSIDE OF THE COMMISSION AND WHAT PROBLEM DO WE REALLY THINK THAT THAT. SORT OF SOULS. OKAY VERY GOOD THANK YOU I CAN THINK OF A ONE ONE AWARD YEAH OKAY. QUICKLY FIND WHAT ONE ONE MODEL THAT MIGHT WORK. AN INDEPENDENT SAFETY A UTILITY SAFETY BOARD. OR ADVISORY BOARD WHATEVER YOU WANNA CALL IT THAT HAS RECOGNIZED EXPERTS SINCE IN SAFETY AND A STAFF. THAT TAKES OVER THE RESEARCH AND ANALYSIS FUNCTIONS LOOKS AT THE LITERATURE TRANSLATES INTO REGULATORY FRAMES OF REFERENCE THAT ARE USEFUL. AND ADDS ACCIDENT INVESTIGATIONS THAT THE UC MIGHT THINK ARTS OR THE PUBLIC THINKS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT THEY WOULD DO. HIRE PEOPLE IF NECESSARY IF THEY DON'T HAVE THEIR OWN STAFF TO DO IT THE ACTION INVESTIGATIONS AND THAT. THEY WOULD REPORT THESE THINGS -- AND THEY WOULD MAKE AT TIMES. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY TO THE PC. I SEE TO BENEFITS OF THIS ONE IS THEY DON'T HAVE TO BURDEN THE PC WITH ADDING YET ANOTHER FUNCTION WHICH IT'S NOT DOING VERY WELL NOW AND RESEARCH AND THEY COULD DO IT SEPARATELY AND HAVE A LOT OF PRESTIGE ABOUT DOING THAT. FUNCTION AT THEIR LEVEL OF SKILL. AND THE THE POLICY ADVICE THEY GIVE TO THE PC FOR REGULATIONS OR WHATEVER OTHER POLICIES. WOULD HAVE SOME WEIGHT. AND WHAT I SEE IS THIS WOULD GIVE A LOT OF POLITICAL COVER. TO THE PC WHICH IS CURRENTLY DOESN'T HAVE NOW BECAUSE WILL DON'T THINK IT HAS ANY COMPETENCE NECESSARILY WITH RESPECT TO SOME OF THE ISSUES ITS INVOLVEMENT. IT WOULD GIVE POLITICAL AND PUBLIC PRESTIGE. IF THE P. YOU SEE DECIDE OKAY ON THE BASIS OF THE RECOMMENDATION OF THIS ADVISORY BOARD WE HAVE DECIDED TO ADOPT THIS. PARTICULAR. RULE OR REGULATION OR WHATEVER -- AND I THINK THAT THAT THAT'S POSSIBLE I COULD SEE THAT HAPPENING WITHOUT DEGRADING THE OTHER FUNCTIONS OF THE UC. AND ACTUALLY ADDING SOMETHING TO A PRECARIOUS. POLITICAL SITUATION THEY CURRENTLY FIND THEMSELVES. THANK YOU FOR THAT IN AND THIS ISN'T BEEN -- VERY INFORMATIVE. FIVE REALLY GRATEFUL. FOR FOR THE CONVERSATION I'VE LEARNED A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT TODAY AND I THINK EVERYONE HAS THOSE WATCHING ON THE CAMERAS AND ELSEWHERE HAVE IS IS WELL -- WE BEST KIND OF DIFFICULT QUESTIONS TODAY AND I THINK THAT'S KIND OF OUR JOB TO DO THAT AND IF TRYING TO GET TO IT I READ THE STRIKE FORCES REPORT IN THE CPUC PROCESS. QUESTIONS IT RAISES AS A CALL TO ACTION FOR THIS LEGISLATURE OF THE SENATE IS ALREADY TAKING ACTIVE STEPS THROUGH THE FORMATION OF A SELECT COMMITTEE TO EXAMINE THE MANY PIECES OF THE LARGER ISSUE OF SAFETY ACROSS. THE STATE'S UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE OUR PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION AND IN MANY WAYS. HAS BEEN AHEAD OF OTHER UTILITY COMMISSIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. IN THE WAY THAT IT'S TRYING TO ADDRESS SAFETY OVERSIGHT IN THE AND I APPLAUD YOU FOR THAT. READING MANY YOUR QUESTION IF THOSE EFFORTS ARE ENOUGH. IF THE PROCESS IS IN PLACE AT THE CPUC MAKE FORWARD PROGRESS ON SAFETY DIFFICULT. IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE AND SO IS HIGHLIGHTED BY THE GOVERNOR'S MESSAGE THE CQC IS AT THE CENTER OF ALL THIS AND THAT'S WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT WE DON'T LOSE SIGHT. OF THEM AND IN THE UPCOMING DISCUSSIONS AS WE GO FORWARD NO AGENCY -- A NOT EVEN THE PC IS AN ISLAND AS WE ALL KNOW AND WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT -- THAT WE'VE A TO OUR ROUTE JOB IS THE RESPONSIBLE OVERSEERS OF OF THEIR ACTIONS AND THAT -- WE REPRESENT AS WE ALL DO. THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA AND DO IT AS WELL SO THANK YOU FOR FOR BEING HERE AND WHILE YOU'RE THERE ARE JUST ONE OPEN THIS OPPORTUNITY FOR ANY PUBLIC -- COMMENTS IF ANYONE IS HERE TO WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SOME COMMENTS. SEEN NO. ONE THANK YOU VERY MUCH AGAIN REALLY APPRECIATED VERY INFORMATIVE BERINGER
