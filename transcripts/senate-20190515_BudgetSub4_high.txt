THE STATE TREASURER'S OFFICE. GOOD MORNING THIS STATE TREASURER. WELCOME OKAY. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR AND OF CENTER OF NUMBER HIS WEALTH -- FOR HERE YESTERDAY I AM REQUESTING A FUNDING REALIGNMENT FROM MY OFFICE. SPECIFICALLY REQUESTING AN INCREASE TO OUR GENERAL FUND ALLOCATION BY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS. ALONG WITH CORRESPONDING DECREASE TO OUR REIMBURSEMENT ALLOCATION. THE SHIP WILL ASSIST THE STATE TREASURER'S OFFICE WITH ITS EFFORT TO APPROPRIATELY REALIGNED FUNDING. BASED ON WORKLOAD GOVERNMENT CODE AND BEST PRACTICES. FURTHERMORE THIS REALIGNMENT WILL ALLOW THE STATE TREASURER'S OFFICE TO REDUCE ITS DEPENDENCE ON REIMBURSEMENTS. THUS REDUCING THIS THE TREASURES OFFICES RISK ASSOCIATED WITH ITS CURRENT UNSUSTAINABLE FUNDING STRUCTURE. AND MY OFFICE IS AVAILABLE AT YOUR STAFF RECOMMENDATION WHICH APPROVES THE REQUEST AS BUDGETED. AND ADOPTS BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE TO REQUIRE MY OFFICE TO REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE I MARCH FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY ON AN ASSESSMENT OF THE OFFICES OVERALL RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS. SUCH AS NO LONGER PROCESSING THE WOMEN INFANTS AND CHILDREN -- WITH BELCHER'S EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE EFFICIENCIES THANK [inaudible] OKAY [inaudible] HELLO. HI CHRISTINE AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE GOOD AFTERNOON. I SAID WE WOULD NOTE THAT WE THINK THIS PROPOSAL IS ABBY TECHNICALLY COMPLEX A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE FUNDING STRUCTURE OF THE STATE TREASURER'S OFFICE -- IT'S BASED IN PART ON A CONSULTANT STUDY THAT WAS -- PRETTY THOROUGH IN PRETTY LENGTHY AND SO -- BUT DOES APPEAR TO BE A PRETTY THOROUGH DOCUMENT IT'S GONNA TAKE SOME TIME TO FULLY REVIEW IN THIS THAT TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT -- PLEASE SUPPORT THIS THAT PROPOSAL I THINK IT'S JUST A DIFFICULT TYPE OF A PROPOSAL TO FULLY EVALUATE IN THE MAY REVISION. WHICH IS NOT QUITE ABBREVIATED AS YOU WELL KNOW. I'M FURTHER WE NOTE THAT IT'S UNCLEAR AT THIS TIME WHETHER THEY'LL BE ANY WORK THAT REDUCTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH. THAT IT REDUCTION WORKLOAD ESTO ES IS THE WITH THE WAY PROGRAM SO -- WHETHER THEY'LL BE STAFFING REDUCTIONS AFFECTED BY THAT -- AND SO WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE TIME WELL YES THAT THAT. SO -- WE SUGGEST LEGISLATURE CONSIDER PROVIDING THE TREASURER'S OFFICE WITH. I SUMMER ALL OF THESE RESOURCES ON A ONE YEAR BASIS JUST -- TO NINETEEN TWENTY WE THINK THAT'LL GIVE SOME ADDITIONAL TIME FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER THEIR LIVES. I'M AND FOR THE TREASURER'S OFFICE TO U. S. SASS -- WHAT STAFFING REDUCTIONS MIGHT BE APPROPRIATE GIVEN THEIR RESPECTIVE? DOMINIC DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- WE'VE BUILT PERMANENT FUNDING IS APPROPRIATE. FACING -- THE SPENDING REALIGNMENT WILL RIGHT SIDE FUNDING STRUCTURE TO BETTER REFLECT ITS CURRENT. OKAY DO YOU LIKE TO ADD ANYTHING YES TO BE YES -- I DID HAND OUT A PACKET I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE THAT BUT IT WILL SHOW US SPECIFICALLY I THINK THE SECOND -- CHART. THAT THE GENERAL FUND SUPPORT SINCE TWENTY TWO THOUSAND ONE IT WAS ABOUT YOU KNOW 46% GENERAL FUND 46% REIMBURSEMENT -- HAS SIGNIFICANTLY DECLINED OVER SINCE TODAY YET THE REIMBURSEMENTS HAVE GONE UP. AND THIS IS OUT WHY WE'RE BACK HERE THIS SENSE OF URGENCY -- WITH THE WITH CONTRACT EXPIRING -- IS GOING TO PUT A LOT OF PRESSURE ON US TRYING TO BALANCE OUR BUDGET. JUST ON REIMBURSEMENTS WHICH WOULD -- TELL. US HAVING TO INCREASE -- THE AMOUNTS THAT WE CHARGE ALL OF THE DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS THAT WE SERVE HERE. IN -- IN OUR OFFICE AND I THINK IT'S A THIRD PAGE FROM LAST. ALL OF THE REIMBURSEMENT THAT WE RECEIVED FROM THE OTHER STATE AGENCIES. AND IT WOULD PUT A LOT MORE PRESSURE. ON ON THE BUDGETS FOR THESE AGENCIES AS WELL WE HAVE TO INCREASE. THE COST FOR THEM SO THAT WE AND DO OUR JOB -- YOU KNOW I THINK THAT WOULD ALSO I SHOULD BE A CONSIDERATION. AND ON THE LAST PAGE QUICK FACTS ABOUT THE TREASURER'S OFFICE. ALSO THE TREASURE HANDLES ABOUT TWO TRILLION DOLLARS OF PAYMENTS AND DEBITS. EACH YEAR THROUGH OUR OFFICE. WE MANAGED OVER A HUNDRED BILLIONDOLLARS IN SHORT TERM INVESTMENTS FOR THE STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. WE ALSO OVERSEE NINETY BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF BONDS AT THIS MOMENT. AND IN ADDITION AS YOU CAN SEE ALL OF THE DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS WHETHER IT'S YOU KNOW HOLDING OUT. THOUSAND INDIVIDUAL ACCOUNTS ACROSS FORTY ONE BANKS WE'VE PROCESS MORE THAN SIXTY MILLION WARRANTS CHECKS AND VOUCHERS. IN A TYPICAL YEAR WE HAVE THE MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND INDIVIDUAL BANK DEPOSITS. WE HAVE TO OF PROCESS NINETY THOUSAND DISHONORED CHECKS THAT MUST BE REVERSED AND TRANSMITTED. WE PROCESS MORE THAN FIFTEEN THOUSAND WIRE TRANSFERS EACH YEAR TYPICALLY. IN WE CLEAR UNSETTLED MORE THAN FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND SECURITY CHANCE BIRTH TRANSACTION EACH YEAR. IN THE COLLATERAL MANAGEMENT SECTION SO EVEN THOUGH THE WICK -- CONTRACT IS GOING TO BE EXPIRING A WE STILL HAVE TO DO ALL OF THESE FUNCTIONS -- AND ALL OF THEM WORK TOGETHER IN A HOLISTIC. MANNER -- SO THERE IS NO PER SE. FULL TIME EQUIVALENT ATTACHED TO JUST THE WITH CONTRACT -- SO I HEAR -- THE LA ROSA -- A STATEMENT THAT THEY WANT TO GIVE US TIME TO RE EVALUATE HOW MANY. POSITIONS ARE GONNA GO AWAY POTENTIALLY THROUGH THE WITH CONTRACT THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN. AND I WOULD LIKE TO NOTE THAT IN TWO THOUSAND ONE WE HAD ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE FULL TIME EQUIVALENT POSITIONS. BACK THEN WE STILL HAVE ABOUT THE SAME TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE FULL TIME EQUIVALENT SO. GIVEN THAT THE STRUCTURE OF FUNDING HAS CHANGED WE STILL MAINTAIN THE SAME NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES SO WE ARE NOT A BLOATED AGENCY. ARE WE DID NOT ADD MORE PEOPLE BECAUSE OF THE WEIGHT CONTRACT. JUSTIN ABLE TO ASK TO BE ABLE -- TO IN ORDER TO TAKE LESS MONEY FROM THE GENERAL FUND. BUT GIVEN THAT THE CONTRACT IS GOING AWAY NOW IT'S CREATING THE SENSE OF URGENCY WITH. OUR FUNDING STRUCTURE IN OUR BUDGET. THIS WAS IN THE MATH MAN TREASURE A NOTE FROM THE ANALYSIS THAT OF AN OUTSIDE CONTRACTOR WAS HIRED TO DO AN ANALYSIS OF THE FUNDING STRUCTURE. THAT DURING YOUR YOUR TIME AS TREASURER OF THAT PRIOR TO YOUR TIME YEAH IT WAS PRIOR TO MY TIME SO I JUST JANUARY SEVENTH OF THIS YEAR BUT IF YOU WOULD LIKE -- THANK YOU CAN TALK ABOUT THE CRIME STUDY. SO AND MAYBE IN A DIFFERENT TIME I AM INTERESTED BECAUSE THIS IS -- TO HOW WORTHWHILE THAT WAS -- AND PERHAPS IT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD USE WITH OTHER DEPARTMENTS OTHER AGENCIES ANYWAY IT SOME POINT OF AB I'D BE INTERESTED IN YOUR FEEDBACK IS TO THAT EXPERIENCE AND AND WHETHER IT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD BROUGHT. IT UP. SO [inaudible] OKAY [inaudible] THAT'S A THE ONLY -- HAVE DID IT DAILY -- HAVE AN OPINION WITH RESPECT TO CONTRACTING OUTSIDE AGENCY FOR PURPOSES OF ANALYZING FUNDING STRUCTURE [inaudible] YOU REMEMBER. SEEMS REASONABLE HAVE A CONSULTANT PERFORM THIS TYPE OF WORK IT -- IT'S PROBABLY MORE THAN WE CAN EXPECT STATE STAFF DO YOU GIVE AND JUST SORT OF THAT THE IN DEPTH NATURE OF THIS WORKLOAD. AND SO I THINK IT'S IT'S PERFECTLY APPROPRIATE THAT THEY DID SO I THINK THAT I'M OUR CONCERN WAS JUST THAT. THE REPORT WAS SO COMPREHENSIVE AND LOOK AT SO MANY THINGS IT'S RATHER LENGTHY UNTIL IT DIFFICULT FOR US TO FULLY EVALUATE AND AND REALLY REVIEW THAT AND THE TIME. AND AND I I I DON'T WANNA SUGGESTED WASN'T PERFECTLY APPROPRIATE OR CAST THIS VERSION I'M JUST. CURIOUS IS THAT IF THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT DOING OTHER PLACES SO WE WE CAN LOOK FOR ANOTHER. THANK YOU [inaudible] OKAY. WELL I THINK THE YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF BEING ABLE TO REPORT BACK. TO THE LEGISLATURE ON THE OVERALL OF RESOURCES AND INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF LOSING. WEIGHT -- I THINK THAT'S A IMPORTANT PART YOU'VE ACCEPTED YEAH -- SO I WOULD MOVE -- PROPOSAL. FUN AND FUND ONGOING. WITH THESE ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATION [inaudible] I MEAN [inaudible] A MODE.

AUTHORIZED IN SB TWELVE NINETY FOUR STRENGTH AND ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTIES FOR UNLICENSED INTEREST ACTIVITY AND EXTEND THE EXISTING SEE EXEMPTION. THIS INCLUDES MY COMMENT AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A BROAD PACKAGE SO DO MY BEST AND IF THERE ARE CERTAIN AREAS THAT ARE OUTSIDE MY EXPERTISE. WILL BE OUR WE'LL GET BACK. TO OKAY. LA -- THANK YOU WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE'VE PREPARED A VERY SHORT HAND OUT FOR YOU AND THE TOTAL YOU HAVE A COPY. OF A SURGEON I HAVE A FEW EXTRAS IF NECESSARY I'M TO SKIP OVER THE FIRST TWO PAGES BECAUSE THEY REALLY JUST SUMMARIZE -- WHAT IS PACKAGES WHICH -- FINANCE PROVIDED A VERY IN DEPTH SUMMARIES I WANT WITH KEEP BACK. AND IF YOU TURN TO PAGE THREE THERE'S JUST A VISUAL REPRESENTATION OF THAT ALLOCATION THERE'S A TABLE THAT JUST SHOWS -- BASICALLY VISUALLY WHAT -- WHAT FINANCE DESCRIBED -- COUPLE THINGS TO HIGHLIGHTED HE MENTIONED THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THERE'S SPENDING THIS EQUITY PROGRAM COMING OUT OF ALLOCATION. ONE AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME -- THERE WILL BE -- FUNDING PROVIDED ALLOCATION THREE ACTIVITIES YOU CAN SEE THAT -- IN THE TABLE HERE. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE FOUR I WOULD BEGIN OUR COMMENTS FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION WE HAVE A FEW THINGS WE JUST WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT FOR THE COMMITTEE. I THE FIRST IS REALLY THAT THIS PLAN REFLECTS THE GOVERNOR'S PRIORITIES SO IN MANY CASES THE LANGUAGE OF PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR IS RATHER BROAD. AND IT ALLOWS A VARIETY OF POSSIBLE ACTIVITIES AND SO REALLY THIS PACKAGE REPRESENTS. THE GOVERNOR'S PRIORITIES FOR THOSE THOSE BENDING CHOICES. AND SECOND WE WOULD NOTE THAT IN GENERAL IT SEEMS THAT THIS PACKAGE IS CONSISTENT WITH PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR ARE THERE A COUPLE OF PLACES WHERE THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF UNCERTAINTY PERHAPS -- IN IN TERMS OF THE CONSISTENCY JUST WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT THOSE ONE IS THE USE OF THE ALLOCATION ONE FOR EQUITY PROGRAMS -- THAT'S REALLY TO GO FOR REGULATORY PURPOSES AND SO -- AND AND AND SO THAT'S A LITTLE BIT -- UNUSUAL THERE AND THEN THE SECOND PIECES OUT USING ALLOCATION PREDEFINED CHILD CARE SPOT SAID JUST WANTED. TO AS IF THE LEGISLATURE'S INTERESTED COULD CERTAINLY ASK ADMINISTRATION ABOUT ITS RATIONALE FOR USING THE FUNDS FOR THIS PURPOSE THAT'S THE NEXT THING WE WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT IS THAT THERE'S SOME UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THE LEGISLATIVE ROLE IN DIRECTING THESE FUNDS. AS WELL AS FINANCE MENTION THESE FUNDS ARE CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED SO THE LEGISLATURE DOESN'T HAVE TO TAKE ACTION TO APPROPRIATE THE FUNDS. I'M AND THERE'S SOME LACK OF CLARITY ABOUT IN THE LANGUAGE ABOUT EXACTLY HOW MUCH THE LEGISLATURE CAN DIRECT THE FUNDS. I'M HOWEVER WE DO KNOW THAT WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE PLAYS A VERY IMPORTANT OVERSIGHT ROLE REGARDLESS OF OF HOW MUCH YOU CAN DIRECT THE FUNDS SPECIFICALLY. I'M WE RAISE SOME SPECIFIC QUESTIONS THAT WE THINK ARE THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER. STE ONE HERE ON THE BOTTOM OF EACH FOR IS WHETHER THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROVIDED SUFFICIENT INFORMATION ON IT IMPLEMENTATION PLAN. WE NOTETHAT THIS PLAN INCLUDES FOR THE FIRST TIME I FUNDING FOR SOME NEW PROGRAMS AS WELL AS A SIGNIFICANT EXPANSION OF SOME EXISTING PROGRAMS. AND SO THE LEGISLATURE'S GONNA WANNA MAKE SURE IT IT'S UNDERSTANDS AND IS COMFORTABLE WITH THOSE DECISIONS AND UNDERSTANDS FOR EXAMPLE WHAT POPULATIONS ARE GONNA BE SERVED. AND YOU KNOW HOW THESE HOW THESE FUNDS WILL GO OUT THOSE KINDS OF THINGS AND SOME CASES -- THERE THESE PROGRAMS ARE STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT TO DO SO. THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT ARE ARE STILL IN SOME CASES BEING WORKED OUT. ADDITIONALLY WE WOULD NOTE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING A ROUGHLY A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY NEW POSITIONS TO IMPLEMENT THIS -- THIS PACKAGE OF THE LEGISLATURE GONNA ENSURE THAT IT HAS SUFFICIENT INFORMATION TO ASSESS THOSE POSITIONS THERE WEREN'T -- TRADITIONAL BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSALS ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE AND SO ON THIS OF THE KINDS OF OF THING VILLAGES YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO MAKE SURE IT UNDERSTANDS -- IN THE CASES WHERE THE LEGISLATURE DOESN'T FEEL LIKE IT HAS SUFFICIENT INFORMATION TO UNDERSTAND HOW THESE PROPOSED ACTIVITIES WOULD OCCUR OR THESE PLANS OUT CERTAINLY WE THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE. TO HAVE THE DEPARTMENT'S REPORT BACK AT AT HEARING SUCH AS THIS ONE ON THOSE PLANS. THE NEXT MAJOR SET OF QUESTIONS WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO ASK ABOUT WHAT OUTCOMES THE DEPARTMENTS ARE EXPECTING TO ACHIEVE WITH THESE FUNDS. SO THIS YEAR IN NINETEEN TWENTY THE IT'S EXPECTED THAT ABOUT TWO HUNDRED MILLION WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR THESE ALLOCATION THREE ACTIVITIES THAT COULD CERTAINLY GROW OVER TIME IS THIS MARKET MATURES. SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT'S AVAILABLE AND THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S COMFORTABLE ON THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS APPROPRIATELY -- IDENTIFIED OUTCOMES THIS WILL HELP THE LEGISLATURE MAKE SURE THAT CAN HOLD THE ADMINISTRATION ACCOUNTABLE -- FOR WHAT IT'S ACHIEVING. IN CASES WHERE THE ADMINISTRATION HS AND IDENTIFY THOSE OUTCOMES EITHER THE LEGISLATURE COULD DIRECT THE ADMINISTRATION TO DO THAT OR IT COULD BE EXPRESSED LEGISLATIVE INTENT -- REGARDING ITS OWN GOALS FOR THE PROGRAM. AND THEN FINALLY -- THE QUOTE THE LAST QUESTION THAT WE HIGHLIGHT IS HOW ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OUTCOMES WILL BE MONITORED AND EVALUATED. I'M SO WE CERTAINLY THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO ASK THE ADMINISTRATION TO TRACK I'M NOT ONLY SAID OUTCOME MEASURES BUT ALSO TRACK HOW IT'S ACHIEVING THOSE -- FOR EXAMPLE THE THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT THAT REQUIRE THE ADMINISTRATION TO PROVIDE OUTCOME ONGOING REPORTING ON WHAT IT'S DOING WITH THESE FUNDS WHAT OUTCOMES HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED -- WE ALSO KNOW JUST ON A TRAILER BILL -- IT IT CAME ALONG WITH THE MAYOR VISION PACKAGE -- IT PRESENTS A NUMBER POLICY CHOICES FOR THE LEGISLATURE -- IT PROBABLY TRADE OFFS ASSOCIATE WITH A VARIETY OF THOSE -- AND CERTAINLY IF THE LEGISLATURE WANTS ADDITIONAL TIME WITH THAT AND IT'S PROBABLY NOT NECESSARY FOR IT TO BE PART OF THE BUDGET PACKAGE YOU COULD BE -- SEPARATED OUT IF IF THAT WAS PREFERRED. THANK YOU -- WITH. COULD YOU GO THROUGH EACH OF THOSE ISSUES PLEASE AND RESPOND -- I ACTUALLY DON'T HAVE THE HAND OUT IN FRONT OF ME HERE THANK YOU -- I THINK. AS IT RELATES TO SOME OF THE GENERALLY COULD SCENES CONSISTENT -- I THINK WE DO THINK THAT THEY ARE IN FACT CONSISTENT WITH THE INTENTIONS AND ALLOWABLE USES UNDER PROP SIXTY FOUR FOR BOTH THE EQUITY PROGRAM AND THE CHILD CARE SPOTS -- EQUITY PROGRAMS FUNDED THROUGH THE BEER OF CANS CONTROL IF YOU READ THE STATUTORY. USES THEY CAN GO TO ADMINISTER IMPLEMENT ENFORCE -- ACTIVITIES THAT ARE AUTHORIZED UNDER THE BEING PICO TWENTY SIX THOUSAND THE EQUITY PROGRAM IS WITHIN THAT CODE -- AND WE THINK THAT THAT MAKES SENSE -- THE CHILD CARE SLIDES -- ARE FUNDED OUT OF THE USE PROGRAM AND IT BASICALLY SPECIFIES THAT THAT THE PROGRAM SHALL EMPHASIZE ACCURATE EDUCATION EFFECTIVE PREVENTION EARLY INTERVENTION SCHOOL RETENTION AND TIMELY TREATMENT SERVICES FOR YOUTH THEIR FAMILIES THEIR CAREGIVERS. ALSO AGAIN WE THINK THAT -- SUBSIDIZING CHILD CARE FOR INCOME ELIGIBLE FAMILIES TO KEEP THESE CHILDREN IN OCCUPIED ENGAGED IN SAFE ENVIRONMENTS AND US -- DISCOURAGING SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER DOES MAKE SENSE AND IT'S CONSISTENT WITH PROPOSITION -- SIXTY FOUR I THINK THAT'S WHAT I'VE HEARD THE MOST. CONCERN. IT IS THE IS THE ISSUE OF KIND THE CHILDCARE SLOTS WITH THIS. UNDERSTANDABLE BUT I DEFINITELY THINK THAT IT'S FITS WITHIN THE ALLOWABLE USES BUT A YOU KNOW ADMITTEDLY IT'S THAT. PROBABLY ISN'T ON THE FOREFRONT OF PEOPLE'S MINDS WHEN THEY READ READ THE LANGUAGE -- SO. THE LEGISLATURE PLAYING -- AN OVERSIGHT ROLE -- I THINK THE ADMINISTRATION IS. DOING -- OUR BEST HERE TO BE -- PARTNERS WITH THE LEGISLATURE WHERE SHARING -- THROUGH THE EIGHT PAGES WE HAVE LIKE A TEN PAGE DOCUMENT WE'VE BEEN MEETING WITH STAFF HOT AND DOING SOME BACK AND FORTH TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE SO WE UNDERSTAND WITHIN THE EXPENDITURE PLAN. BUT ALSO REALIZING THAT THIS IS. A LITTLE AND TRADITIONAL IN THAT IT'S CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED -- FINDING -- IN THAT. PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR BASICALLY. TOLD US THAT THIS MONEY WOULD BECOME AVAILABLE WE SHOULD GENTLY SPEND ON THESE ACTIVITIES AND THEN ACTUALLY DETERMINED WITHIN THESE COMPONENTS WHO SHOULD SELECT WHAT THOSE ACTIVITIES SHOULD BE SO -- I THINK WE'RE HAPPY TO CONTINUE THESE CONVERSATIONS AND TRY -- TO KEEP DOING THAT THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS AND YOU KNOW I THINK WE SHARE IN THE CONCERN OF MAKING SURE THAT THESE INVESTMENTS GO -- TO MEANINGFUL OUTCOMES ABOUT WE HAVEN'T% ACTUALLY DONE ANYTHING FORMALLY I WOULD SAY YOU TO SORT OF SOLIDIFY THAT. SO HAVE YOU THOUGHT OF MORE SPECIFIC WAYS IN WHICH ON A ON GOING BASIS THE LEGISLATURE. WOULD BE INVOLVED OR I AGAIN I THINK WE'RE DOING THAT RIGHT NOW -- WITH THE RELEASE OF THE MAY REVISION SHARING THIS INFORMATION SHARING OUR PLANS THROUGH -- NARRATIVE DOCUMENTS MEETING WITH FOLKS -- AND SO I THINK WE ARE TRAINED TO KEEP THE LEGISLATURE AND INVOLVED AND ENGAGED BY ALSO RECOGNIZED THAT IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT BUT IT'S NOT A BUDGET ACT PREPARATION. AND NOT AND GOING TO THAT TRADITIONAL PROCESS BUT WE'RE HAPPY TO ENGAGE IN WHAT AND WHATEVER WAYS THROUGH HEARINGS AND HAVING THESE CONVERSATIONS LIKE WE ARE TODAY. AND TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE FULL UNDERSTANDING WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO. OKAY BOOM I THINK THERE'S A FEW MORE OF WITH REGARDS TO ONE HUNDRED EIGHT THIS THE STAFFING THE IMPLEMENTATION IN THE STAFFING. YES SO -- THERE ARE A HUNDRED EIGHTY POSITIONS I THINK -- A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THOSE WE HAVE PROVIDED SORT OF AT LEAST -- I'VE OF PARAGRAPH OR SO PER PHYSICIAN OR GENTLY WHAT THOSE POSITIONS WILL BE DOING FOR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE GOES AND SOME OF THOSE ARE REALLY -- I WOULD SAY THAT THE POSITIONS KIND OF FALL INTO SIN GENERAL CATEGORIES OF GRANT ADMINISTRATION AND ADDITIONAL SORT OF ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES THAT ARE TAKING PLACE TODAY OR THAT WILL HELP FURTHER SORT OF ACTIVITIES THAT WERE SPECIFIED IN PROPOSITION. SIXTY FOUR SO I DO THINK THAT WE HAVE PROVIDED GENERALLY -- INFORMATION ABOUT THOSE POSITIONS WHAT THEY'LL BE DOING -- AND I THINK THEY ARE SORT OF CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WAS INTENDED UNDER PROPOSITION. SIXTY FOUR AND WITH REGARD TO THE OUTCOMES THE YOU COULD CHECK OUT HOW WILL YOU GET TO THOSE IN. DEVELOP THOSE OUTCOMES -- AS I KIND OF MENTIONED THAT SOME OF THESE ALREADY I THINK HAVE IT REALLY JUST DEPENDS ON THE INDIVIDUAL PROGRAM AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE I THINK EACH ONE OF THEM. HAS IS WAS SELECTED -- BECAUSE ONE WE'VE ALREADY SAID THAT IT'S A WORKING PROGRAM AND WE WANT TO INVEST MORE IN THAT AREA BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE THERE'S A NEED -- OR THAT WE SHARED SHARING YOUR INTEREST OF MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE IMPROVED OUTCOMES BUT SOME OF THESE ARE SO NEW THAT WE HAVEN'T RELEASED IT UP. A COUPLE OF LIKE THREE OF THESE GRANT PROGRAMS I THINK THIS IS PROBABLY A LITTLE PREMATURE TO DETERMINE WHAT OUTCOMES WILL ULTIMATELY BE CHEATED BUT WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO MONITOR AND TRY TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS IN THOSE AREAS. YES SIR TO SEEMS LIKE IF YOU'RE NOT SURE WHAT THE OUTCOMES ARE THAT YOU WANTED CHIEF HOW DO YOU COME UP WITH A NUMBER OF A HUNDRED EIGHTY POSITIONS. YEAH THOSE HUNDRED EIGHTY ARE SPREAD ACROSS ACROSS A LOT OF AREAS I THINK GENERALLY THE MOST OF THEM FALL INTO THE ENFORCEMENT -- OF ILLEGAL CULTIVATION AND REMEDIATION AND CLEAN UP ACTIVITIES AND THE RESOURCES BUCKET. OUR COMPONENT OCASIONES SORRY -- AND SO I THINK THAT AGAIN AND SOME OF THOSE FISH AND WILDLIFE IN PARTICULAR ALREADY HAS SOME OF THOSE POSITIONS AND IS DOING SOME OF THAT WORK TODAY SO IT'S REALLY JUST AN EXPANSION OF EXISTING ACTIVITY -- AND I THINK. I THINK THOSE DEPARTMENTS WOULD TELL YOU THAT THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF ILLEGAL CULTIVATION -- THAT IS OUT THERE THAT NEEDS TO ONE BE ENFORCED AGAINST AND THEN AFTER BE REMEDIATED AND CLEANED UP AND SO I THINK THIS IT WILL HLP US. YOU KNOW START TO MOVE TOWARD THAT BUT I DON'T THINK IN ANYWAY IT'S YOU KNOW IN A STE POLICE ALL OF THE PROBLEM. I FIGURE WITH. WOULD BE HELPFUL TO GET -- WHAT YOU EXPECTS SPRINGS HAS BEEN UP UNTIL NOW? WHAT YOU HAVE ACHIEVED WHAT YOU'RE? YOU KNOW I THINK IT GIVES US A BASE FROM WHICH IS THE OKAY. THIS MAKES SENSE HUNDRED EIGHTY OR NINETY WHATEVER IN THE IN THE DIFFERENT WAYS THAT YOU'RE HERE ALLOCATED STUFF. BUT IT'S WHEN YOU WILL ONLY SEE IS A HUNDRED EIGHTY NEW POSITIONS BUT NOT KNOWING WHAT IS LINKED TO AND I THINK MAKES IT [inaudible] MORE DIFFICULT. A DIFFICULT FOR US IS THE LEGISLATURE. IN A WE HAVE SHARED SOME ADDITIONAL DETAILS WITH THE LA -- AND STAFF ON SOME OF THESE PIECES. AND SPEAKING TO THE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY I I DON'T KNOW OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD THE NUMBER THAT WE'VE SHARED SOME OF THOSE DETAILS BUT I WOULD SAY IT'S OVER 50% OF THOSE. WE'VE SHARED -- KIND OF IT WHAT WHAT ACTIVITIES WILL BE TAKING PLACE AND THEN LIKE IT'S IN SOME OF THESE OTHER ONES ARE SMALLER AND IT'S MORE A GRANT ADMINISTRATION. TYPE OF ACTIVITY MORE ADMINISTRATIVE WORK [inaudible] SENATOR YES. I'D LIKE TO EXPAND A LITTLE BIT ON THE CONCERNED JUST RAISED. BUT THE CHAIR AND AND ON OTHERS AS WELL. THIS IS A VERY MAJOR. POLICY CHANGE IN THE HISTORY OF CALIFORNIA. AND HOW CALIFORNIA IS GOING TO CONDUCT ITS BUSINESS AND RAISE OUR CHILDREN. THE SOCIETAL IMPACTS ARE VERY SIGNIFICANT. SO THE IMPLEMENTATION CANNOT BE TAKEN CASUALLY. IN MY OPINION. IS IT ANTICIPATED THAT. ACTIONS WILL BE TAKEN TO THE REGULATORY PROCESS AS YOU PROMULGATE. AS YOU MOVE AHEAD THE POLICIES. TO TO HANDLE CANNABIS IN CALIFORNIA WILL THEY BE DONE REGULATORY EARLY. IS THAT A PART OF IT -- WELL THAT THREE MAIN LICENSING ENTITIES -- DID -- COMPLETE THEIR FINAL REGULATIONS IN JANUARY I THINK TWO THOUSAND OLD REGULATIONS ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE A PART. YEAH YEAH I MEAN I DO THINK THAT THAT'S TYPICAL FOR THERE'S ALL KIND OF THINGS ARE GOING TO COME UP AS THIS MOVES ALONG AND IT NEEDS TO BE DONE REGULATORY NOT BY FIA. MEANING YOU TO STILL PUT OUT A MEMO AND SAYING THIS IS A NEW DEAL YOU'VE GOT A REGULATION. AND A STATUTE TO SUPPORT. THE REGULATIONS SO. JUST A REMINDER [inaudible] AND I REALLY DON'T KNOW IN THIS WHOLE REALM. WHAT THE LEGISLATIVE? OVERSIGHT IS. THE WHOLE THING SOUNDS A LOT LIKE [inaudible] UC'S CONSTITUTIONAL AUTONOMY END OF THAT IS INDEED OF SOME CONCERN. AND DO UNDERSTAND CONTINUES APPROPRIATION DOESN'T MEAN AUTOMATIC PROBATION FOREVER THAT CAN BE. CHANGED. I DON'T HAVE A LEGAL OPINION HOW THAT BOUNCES UP AGAINST INITIATIVE BUT IT IS OF SOME CONCERN. AND THE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT IS CRITICAL AND THAT'S WHY. THE MONITORING. IN THE STABLISHMENT OF GOALS THIS CRITICAL. AND WHAT I'M HEARING TODAY AS WELL AS JUST GOING TO INVOLVED IN WILL GET AROUND TO IT. NOT ENOUGH SERIOUSNESS ABOUT IT AND I HEAR THAT. IN THE COMMENTS OF THE CHAIR YOU HEAR THAT IN MY COMMENTS. TO TO PRESENT THIS WHOLE NEW EXPERIMENT. IN THIS STATE. AND HAVE IT WORK. THINGS NEED TO BE VERY CLEAR AND MONITOR. AND I WOULD ARGUE PARTICULARLY IN THIS SENSITIVE AREA. ONE OF OUR GREATEST PROBLEMS IN GOVERNMENT IS WE PASS MILLIONS OF BILLS [inaudible] YEAH MILLIONS [inaudible] OVER DECADES. BUT WITH A LITTLE HEAT. TO MONITORING THE SUCCESSES. A NEW PROGRAM. THEN THE WE WATCH THE PROGRAM AND DO WE HAVE ACCOUNTABILITY THE PROGRAM OR THEIR BENCHMARKS OTHER MILESTONES [inaudible] FAILURES. WHAT'S GOING ON IN HIGH TECH IN CALIFORNIA IS A CLASSIC EXAMPLE. I WOULD NOT WANT TO SEE THAT HAPPEN HERE. AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE. YOU TO GET A LOT MORE SERIOUS. ABOUT THE EXPECTATIONS. AND ABOUT THE GOALS SO THEN WE HAVE A BENCHMARK. WITH THE INFORMATION WE GET. TO REFERENCE AND JUDGE. THANK YOU GIPSON. UNDER ANY INCREASES. I'M SO I I THINK ONE THING THAT WOULD BE REALLY HELPFUL IS. A LOT MORE EXPLICITLY THAN WHAT'S HERE [inaudible] IS WHAT. YOU KNOW WHAT THE BREAKDOWN OF AUTHORITY IS. THE GOVERNOR AND WHERE THE LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY IS. WHERE IT'S JUST A MATTER OF -- WILL. IT WILL BE CORDIAL AND LET THE LEGISLATIVE YOU KNOW LET THE LEGISLATION NO. OR HOW MUCH OF A REQUIREMENT IS THAT. TO CONSULT SO I THINK THAT KIND OF CLARITY BETWEEN WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S. ROLL AND WHAT THE LEGISLATORS ROLE LEGISLATIONS ROLE IS WOULD BE REALLY IMPORTANT AND I I A I KNOW THIS WAS PASSED WITH SOME VERY. EXPLICIT OF THINGS THAT NORMALLY THE LEGISLATION WOULD HAVE A LOT MORE TO DO WITH IT. THAN THIS SO -- I JUST IT JUST SEEMS VERY VAGUE AND I THINK I WANT TO BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN TO MY COLLEAGUES. RIGHT THIS IS WHAT WE SAY LIKE WE THERE ARE GOING TO BE INCLUDED. VERY EXPLICITLY VERY CLEARLY FOUR AND HOW WE'RE GOING TO BE INCLUDED -- AND AND I DO AGREE WITH SENATOR NELSON THAT THIS IS A VERY BIG. CULTURAL. TO IT'S A VERY BIG ECONOMIC CHANGE AND EVERYTHING THAT WILL FLOW FROM IT. IS DOLLARS AND CENTS THAT WE COULD NEVER HAVE IMAGINED JUST A FEW YEARS AGO. SO I KNOW THE GOVERNOR TAKES THIS WITH A LOT OF OF RESPONSIBILITY AND SERIOUSNESS. BUT WE JUST NEED TO SEE MORE OF IT AND THIS SEEMS TO BE VERY BARE BONES AT THIS POINT BUT THOSE ARE JUST MY COMING -- WE HAVE -- PUBLIC COMMENT PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON GOING BACK IS FOR DRUG POLICY ALLIANCE. DRUG POLICY ALLIANCE'S SEE FOR PARTNER DRUG POLICY ACTION WAS THE SECOND LARGEST DONOR. TO PROP SIXTY FOUR AND CONTRIBUTED TO THE DRAFTING WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S ACROSS HER COVER. TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO IMPLEMENT THE EQUITY SECTIONS WE THINK THAT IS EARLY INVESTMENT IN EQUITY WHICH IS INTENDED TO DIVERSIFY OWNERSHIP IN THE MARKETPLACE. WHO ARE FROM COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN MOST IMPACTED BY? MASS INCARCERATION IN THE DRUG WAR WHAT A CHANCE FOR ACTUAL OWNERSHIP IN THIS LEGAL MARKET. AND WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THAT IN GENERAL WE ARE EXCITED BY THE DIRECTION OF THE NEW ADMINISTRATION IS TAKING THANK YOU. OKAY ANYBODY ELSE [inaudible] OKAY. SO THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION IS TO ADOPT -- PLEASE HOLD TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE -- I COULD HEAR A MOTION TO THAT EFFECT. MOVE THE RECOMMENDATION OKAY. LOVER. ROLL CALL. THIRD RAZA HI THERE NIELSEN.

OUR OFFICE ALSO ASSIST WITH SMALL BUSINESS DISASTER PREPAREDNESS AND ECONOMIC RECOVERY POST DISASTER. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION [inaudible] HELLO. CAROLINE SHE WITH LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS WITH THIS PROPOSAL WE SIMPLY WOULD NOTE -- THAT THIS WOULD ONLY ALLOW GO BEST LIKELY JUST SERVICE A SMALL SHARE OF OVERALL SMALL BUSINESSES IN THE STATE -- AND SO THE LEGISLATURE MAY BE INTERESTED TO TO HEAR FROM KOBE IS -- HOW THEY MIGHT PLAN TO A TO A CAST A BROADER NET WITH THESE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES? YOUR ANSWER PLEASE SURE YES OF COURSE AB WE'VE BEEN ORKING IN THE PAST THE PARTNERSHIPS AND I WOULD HOPE TO EXPAND THAT -- I'VE BEEN FOUR WEEKS IN THE POSITION BUT LOOKING -- TO YOU KNOW CONTINUE TO LOOK AT WHERE THERE ARE GAPS -- AND WITH THIS EXPANDED -- STAFFING BE ABLE TO TRY TO START TO FULFILL THOSE AND AND WORK WITHIN THE COMMUNITIES REGIONALLY. ADD TO IDENTIFY CHALLENGES AND AND HELP THEM -- NETWORK WITH US BETTER IN ORDER TO RAISE THE RATES THE CONCERNS OF SMALL BUSINESSES -- WHAT ONE QUESTION I DO HAVE ALONG THOSE LINES? IS -- MAYBE AS YOU IDENTIFY WHERE OR WHICH PARTNERSHIPS IS -- TO MAYBE GEOGRAPHICALLY. LET US KNOW FOR THOSE NEEDS ARE AS WELL. DEFINITELY. I THINK IT COULD HELP SOME OF US IF THERE IS. SOMETHING THAT WE COULD DO. TO BE HELPFUL TO OUR REACH TO OUR COMMUNITIES -- MAYBE WE COULD. JUST ADD MORE. YOU KNOW RATE BECAUSE CURRENTLY WE HAVE A NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN AND WE WERE ASKING IN THIS PROPOSAL FOR THE ADDITION OF A CENTRAL VALLEY -- POSITION BUT I MEAN OF COURSE A THREE POINT NINE MILLION BUSINESSES EMPLOY A HALF OF THE PRIVATE WORK FORCE AND SO -- YOU KNOW WE CAN NEVER COMPLETELY SCALE UP TO BE ABLE TO MEET THE NEEDS BUT GEOGRAPHICALLY OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE OTHER -- AREAS THAT WE COULD YOU HAVE INDIVIDUALS PLACE MMHM MMHM. MAYBE SOME SORT OF MANY CAMPAIGN HERE YOU KNOW WERE YOU. YOU KNOW TAKE IT THROUGH THE STATE NOT ONLY DO THESE TOURS SO. SMALL BUSINESS ADVOCATE DAY AND I'M SURE YOU'VE DONE THINGS LIKE THAT I'M NOT TRYING TO SUGGEST THIS IS A NEW IDEA -- BUT SINCE I KNEW A MAYBE THAT'S WHY IT'S COMING -- COMING TO MY MIND IS HOW CAN WE GET THIS INFORMATION OUT IN THEM MORE. OF A PROACTIVE WAY I'LL DEFINITELY LOOK INTO THAT OKAY. THANK YOU [inaudible] FINANCE. NOTHING OF MEMBERS. ANY YES CENTER NIELSEN. USUALLY WHEN WE GET REQUEST STAFFING WHY IS THERE SOME BASIS FOR WHICH THAT IS REQUESTED. WE DON'T HAVE ANY HERE IT'S JUST GONNA WELL MAYBE WE CAN SERVE MORE IF [inaudible] DO. I THINK WE REQUIRE OF THOSE SHOULD REQUIRE A LITTLE BIT MORE OF THAT. HOW MANY DO YOU HAVE ANY INVENTORY OF HOW MANY BUSINESSES CAL BIZ IS REALLY HELPED NOW AN INVENTORY OF? NUMBERS OR DO YOU KEEP A RUNNING TRACK OF WHO THEN HELPED IN COMMUNITY NUMBERS OF BUSINESSES THAT HAVE BEEN HELPED BY CAL THIS I'M I WOULD BE I WOULD DEFER TO CALPERS ON THAT BUT FOR MY OFFICE THE OFFICE OF SMALL BUSINESS ADVOCATE -- WE KNOW WE COLLABORATE WITH THEM. IN ORDER TO FULFILL THE NEEDS OF SMALL BUSINESSES THAT APPROACHES AND WE ALSO NETWORK IN THE COMMUNITY EVENTS -- TO SUPPORT THEIR NEEDS AS WELL BUT I DENIED -- CALVUS WOULD BE ABLE TO RESPOND BETTER. WE DO WE DON'T HAVE A REPRESENTATIVE HERE FROM TOPIC AT THE MOMENT BUT WE CAN. GET THAT. IF YOU WOULD THE BILL BEFORE I'D VOTE ON THIS I'M GOING TO WANT TO HAVE. SOMETHING LOUDEST ABSTAINED TODAY [inaudible] OKAY. BUT BUT THERE IT BUT THIS IS SPECIFIC. TO CENTRAL VALLEY. THE OUT WHILE THE THREE POSITIONS WOULD BE FOR THE OFFICE OF THE SMALL BUSINESS ADVOCATE NOW ONE OF THOSE POSITIONS WOULD BE FOR CENTRAL VALLEY AND YOU CURRENTLY DON'T HAVE OR YOU'RE ADDING. TO CURRENTLY DON'T HAVE. OKAY. SO THAT'S A CHANGE BETTER CHANGE THAT'S A CHANGE PROPOSING IN ADDITION EXPAND YOUR SERVICES AND IN ADDITION OUR OFFICES I STARTED ADMINISTERING A GRANTS PROGRAM LAST YEAR WHICH WAS NEW AND IS CREATING NEW DEMANDS ON THE OFFICE AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE ABLE TO FILL. THE FORMATION OF THE OFFICE WITH THIS EXPANDED STAFF REQUEST. THAT AND IT'S SO WHY DID YOU DECIDE TO DO IT IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. WHAT HAS COME I THINK? THE CENTER NIELSEN'S QUESTION IS -- YOU'RE ASKING FOR MORE POSITIONS -- YOU MENTION CENTRAL VALLEY WHAT TRIGGERED THAT. I THINK OFTENTIMES AND WE SEE REFLECTED THAT -- ZIP CODES ARE OFTEN NEGLECTED IN TERMS OF THEIR THEIR CAPACITY TO GROW AND SCALE INNOVATIVE SMALL BUSINESS ESPECIALLY -- AND SO THERE ARE MULTIPLE NEEDS THROUGHOUT THE STATE WE FELT THAT CENTRAL VALLEY WAS IN IN DIRE NEED IN POSITION TO TRY TO EXPAND IN TERMS OF SMALL BUSINESS SUPPORT. AND THAT'S USUALLY THE AREA THAT WERE LEAST ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE AT LEAST WITH -- OUR LOS ANGELES OFFICE WERE ABLE TO MEET MOST OF THE SOUTHERN. OUT REQUESTS AND THING FOR THE NORTH. WITHOUT COLLECTED COVER ADDITIONAL GROUND [inaudible] OKAY. YEAH I SITE I THINK THAT'S THE SORT OF THING THAT. THE SENATOR WAS LOOKING FOR IS WHY? WHY AND EXPANSION LET'S NOT EXPANSION OF WORKLOAD USUALLY LOT OF THE REQUEST ARE WE'RE GETTING? WORKLOAD IS GETTING TOO HIGH WE NEED TO FILL THE BILL TO JUST CARRY ON ARGUE THESE -- SO I THINK THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL OKAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR. WE'RE SUPPOSED TO WORK QUESTIONS OKAY I'LL ENTERTAIN A MOTION. OF CONCERT PUBLIC COMMENT YES SIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH AFRAID NO WERE REPRESENTED CAL AGING CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND THE SILICON VALLEY LEADERSHIP GROUP. BOTH IN VERY MUCH STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS A PROPOSAL THAT WE THINK WILL STIMULATE TRADE IN A IN A VERY CRITICAL TIME. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT RIGHT IT DADDY I THINK HE WAS REFERRING TO MY ITEM WHICH I HAVE -- ITEM NEXT ITEM TRADE. THANKS. I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS TRADE YEAH. WE'RE WORKING CLOSELY TOGETHER. SHOULD I GO WITH MINE -- OUR DO YOU WANT TO HAVE MORE PUBLIC COMMENT. LE LET ME JUST LOOK AT THIS JUST FINISH THIS. ONE YES BUT WE NEED A MOTION ON THIS ONE ISSUE. EIGHTEEN A MOVE. OKAY THERE'S A MOTION TO APPROVE THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION. IN RAZA. INTERNALS AND AT THE CENTER ON BURKE [inaudible] OKAY. THE NEXT. ONE OKAY THIS IS THE INTERNATIONAL TRADE OFFICIALS OKAY -- GOOD AFTERNOON CHARTER ALSO AND SENATORS MY NAME IS BY CALLING ON THE SENIOR ADVISOR FOR INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS AND TRADING COPE AS THE B. C. P. FOR THREE INTERNATIONAL TRADE INVESTMENT SPECIALISES FOCUSED ON INCREASING THE CAPACITY. OF THE INTERNATIONAL FAIRS UNIT ECHO BILLS. CALIFORNIA IS THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. ONE IN FIVE JOBS IN THE STATE DEPENDS ON INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND INVESTMENT THAT'S UP FROM ONE IN TEN JOBS TWENTY YEARS AGO. SINCE TWO THOUSAND THREE CALIFORNIA'S INVESTMENT INTERNATIONAL TRADE HAS BEEN MINIMAL THERE'S THREE PEOPLE IN MY GROUP. PUTTING MYSELF. A AND THE RESULTS ARE EVIDENT. DECLINING SHARE OF EXPORTS FROM TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND DECLINING SHARE FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT FROM 25% IN. WO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AT THE SAME TIME OTHER STATES HAVE HEAVILY INVESTED IN ARE GAINING SHARE. FORTY OF FIFTY STATES HAVE INTERNATIONAL TRADE SPECIALIST. WHEN CALIFORNIA ELIMINATED MOST OF ITS INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND INVESTMENT SPENDING IN? TWO THOUSAND THREE THE WORLD WAS NOT CONNECTED LIKE IT IS TODAY. THE INTERNET WAS IN ITS INFANCY. CHINA WAS NOT THE ECONOMIC POWER IT IS TODAY. OTHER STATES HAD NOT RAMPED UP THEIR INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND INVESTMENT EFFORTS. TIMES HAVE CHANGED AND CALIFORNIA MUST CHANGE WITH THEM IF IT WANTS TO MAINTAIN ITS SHARE OF WORLD TRADE AND INVESTMENT. I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE. THANK YOU HELLO. ALSO THE THE HISTORY AS WAS JUST NOTED I IS ALSO WELL SPELLED OUT OF A CALIFORNIA'S EFFORTS TO BOOST INTERNATIONAL TRADE IN THE PAST. PRIOR TO TERMINATING THESE ACTIVITIES IN TWO THOUSAND THREE OUR OFFICE OF LONG QUESTION THE ABILITY OF THE STATE TO REALLY INFLUENCE INDIVIDUAL BUSINESSES BEHAVIOR AND CHOICES. WE CONTINUE TO AFFECT ODD THAT DECISION INDIVIDUAL DECISIONS BY BUSINESSES ON AND WE'VE SIMPLY WOULD ENCOURAGE THE LEGISLATURE TO CONTINUE TO ASK QUESTIONS OF THE ADMINISTRATION AND BE. SKEPTICAL OF THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE STATE CAN EFFECTIVELY -- CHANGE THE TIDE OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN THESE AREAS AND AFFECT INDIVIDUAL BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS. OF WOULD YOU LIKE TO RESPOND -- IN TWO THOUSAND THREE WE HAD EIGHTY FIVE EMPLOYEES TWELVE TRADE OFFICES AND IN TODAY'S DOLLARS WE'RE SPENDING ABOUT THIRTEEN MILLION DOLLARS. MOST OF THAT MONEY WAS GOING INTO TRADE OFFICES. THIS PROPOSAL IS NOT FOR TRADE OFFICES IT IS FOR THREE ADDITIONAL INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND INVESTMENT SPECIALISTS ONE FOR THE AMERICA'S ONE FOR EUROPE AND ONE FOR ASIA. WHICH WILL BE FOCUSED ON SPECIFIC AND MEASURABLE ACTIVITIES IN THOSE -- THREE A GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS. OF THOSE ARE FOCUSED ON OUR BIGGEST TRADING PARTNERS IN AMERICA'S CANADA AND MEXICO. IN EUROPE IT'S GERMANY THE NETHERLANDS AND THE UK. A IN THE E. U. IN GENERAL AND IN ASIA IT'S CHINA JAPAN. KOREA INDIA HONG KONG AND VIETNAM. SO I THINK THAT -- THIS IS A VERY MINIMAL INVESTMENT. IF YOU LOOK AT OTHER STATES FOR EXAMPLE JUST TO GIVE YOU SOME. PERSPECTIVE ABOUT WASHINGTON HAS. SIX PEOPLE IN THIS AREA. IT IS. FIVE POINT CALIFORNIA'S FIVE POINT THREE TIMES AS LARGE AN ECONOMY. MINNESOTA HAS TWELVE PEOPLE IN THEIR INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS GROUP. WE ARE EIGHT TIMES LARGER AS AN ECONOMY. IN COLORADO HAS TEN PEOPLE WE ARE A POINT ONE TIMES AS LARGE SO. THERE HAS TO BE A MINIMAL INVESTMENT WE HAVE. HUNDREDS OF DELEGATIONS COMING TO SEE US WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONVERT THOSE INTO INVESTMENT IN CALIFORNIA AND CALIFORNIA JOBS. BUT WE WE CANNOT CONTINUE THIS LEVEL OF INVESTMENT IF WE WANT TO BE SUCCESSFUL. AND IF WE WANT TO REVERSE THE DECLINE IN OUR MARKET SHARE FOR EXPORTS IN OUR MARKET SHARE FOR FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT. THEY ARE GOING TO OTHER STATES. CAN YOU GIVE A SPECIFIC EXAMPLE ABOUT HOW. HAVING THE STAFF WOULD. BLOOM PRODUCE GREATER RESULTS AND WHAT WE'RE GETTING ESPECIALLY IN A MORE COMPETITIVE. SURE WORLD -- FOR EXAMPLE ONE OF THE THINGS WE WANT TO DO THERE ARE OFFICES -- OF FROM THE US COMMERCIAL SERVICES FOR EXAMPLE. THEY HAVE TWELVE OFFICES IN CALIFORNIA AND THEY ALSO HAVE AN OFFICE IN EVERY EMBASSY AROUND THE WORLD THIS IS U. S. OFFICES. ON I WANT TO DEVELOP VERY% FOCUSED BUSINESS PLANS OFFER A FIFTEEN TOP EXPORT AND FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT MARKETS THE COUNTRIES THAT I JUST NAMED. WHERE WE WOULD WORK HAND IN GLOVE WITH US COMMERCIAL SERVICES TO INCREASE THE LEADS? INCREASE THE MARKET ENTRY STUDIES -- INCREASE THE TRADE MISSIONS -- AND BE ABLE TO CONVERT THOSE INTO TANGIBLE BENEFITS FOR THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. SO SOME OF IT IS ALSO WORKING DIRECTLY WITH OUR REGIONAL PARTNERS. THE GOOD NEWS ABOUT OUR OFFICE IS CLOSING IN TWO THOUSAND THREE WITH OUR REGIONAL PARTNERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE HAVE GOTTEN A LOT STRONGER. IF YOU LOOK AT THE ALLEY CHAMBER WHO'S HERE TODAY THEY'RE HAVING THEIR SACRAMENTO DAY -- WHERE THE SAN DIEGO REGIONAL EDC OR THE FRESNO BUSINESS COUNSELOR EDC? BECAUSE THERE HAS BEEN ALMOST ZERO STATE SUPPORT. THEY HAVE HAD TO GET A LOT STRONGER AND NOW IT HAS BEEN GREAT. BUT WHAT WE COULD DO IF WE ALL WORK TOGETHER. IS REALLY SHARE BETTER HAVE A BETTER DIRECTION. NOT DUPLICATE EFFORTS AND BE IN A POSITION TO REALLY LEVERAGE THAT NEW FOUND POWER THAT WE HAVE IN THE CALIFORNIA REGIONS AND EXTENDED OUT TO THE WORLD. SO THOSE ARE JUST A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT I WOULD SEE US DOING MORE OF CENTER [inaudible] QUESTION. IN THE UNITED STATES HAS TRADE OFFICES ALL OVER THE WORLD. OF THEIR MISSION IS TO INCREASE TRADE WITH -- HIM WITH THE RISE IS IN BETWEEN ON VARIOUS COUNTRIES IN THE UNITED STATES. YOU KNOW GIVEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND AND THIS IS MY OPINION -- ANTIPATHY IN TERMS OF CALIFORNIA WE SEE ANYTHING. CHANGE THE LAST COUPLE YEARS -- WITH RESPECT TO OF FOR EXAMPLE ANY SORT OF PREFERENCE OR THE LACK THEREOF WITH RESPECT CALIFORNIA BUSINESS BY OUR US ORGANIZATIONS. I'LL GIVE YOU A TWO PART ANSWER THE FIRST PART IS THAT. GENERALLY WHAT WE FIND -- IN THE U. S. COMMERCIAL SERVICES WHICH IS A PART OF THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE. THE THE PERSONNEL THAT IS DIVIDED GEOGRAPHICALLY AND IS FOCUSED ON CALIFORNIA NO I HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING THEY WANT TO HELP US THEY'RE ACTIVELY ENGAGE WITH US IN FACT I HAVE A MEETING WITH THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. HEAD THAT COVERS THE ARIZONA AND NEVADA AND HAWAII AND SO THE CALIFORNIA TOMORROW DOWN IN ORANGE COUNTY SO. AND AND THE ONES UP HERE THE THE REGIONAL HAD FOR NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND SOME OF THE WESTERN STATES IS IN UTAH BUT HE'S VERY COOPERATIVE AND AND GOOD. THE TWELVE OFFICES AGAIN. A COOPERATIVE IN FACT SOME OF THEM ARE HEADING OF CALIFORNIA DISTRICT EXPERT COUNCILS SO THAT I THINK -- HAS BEEN GREAT -- WAS MY SECOND POINT. MY POINT WAS GIVEN WHAT I BELIEVE TO BE THE TIP OF THE OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WITH RESPECT TO THE ACTIONS OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS THE ADMINISTRATION TOWARDS. CALIFORNIA WEATHER'S BEEN A CHANGE YES -- MY I REMEMBER START -- THE SECOND POINT IS WE HAVE SOMETHING A FEDERAL PROGRAM CALLED STEP IT'S THE STATE TRADE EXPORT PROMOTION PROGRAM. PART IT THIS IS AN ANTIPATHY BUT IT'S BAKED INTO THE LAW -- IT WAS. DEVELOPED BY SOME SENATORS FROM SMALLER STATES SAYS ABOUT SEVENTEEN OR EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLARS AVAILABLE AND THESE ARE THREE TO UP TO THREE THOUSAND pBUSINESSES. WORKING WITH ISABEL'S GROUP OUGHT TO DO MARKET ENTRY -- BUT STUDIES OR TO GO INTO ON A TRADE MISSION OUT TO ANOTHER COUNTRY -- WE ARE CAPPED AT NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT'S THE MOST THAT ANY STATE CAN GET. THAT'S ABOUT 5% OF THE MONEY BUT WERE ABOUT 12% OF THE POPULATION. WERE THE NUMBER ONE TRADE STATE WE'RE NUMBER ONE IN AGRICULTURAL EXPORTS NUMBER WHEN A MACHINERY EXPORTS NUMBER ONE ELECTRONICS EXPORTS. THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING WELL AND WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO DO WELL -- BUT IT'S HARD WHEN WE CAPPED AT 5% SO I WOULDN'T CALL THAT ANTIPATHY BUT I WOULD SAY IT IS BAKED INTO THE LAW AND I BET. THAT'S THE CHANGE THE LAST TWO YEARS NOW NOW THAT HASN'T CHANGED WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP SO BUT BUT MY SECOND POINT IS IS THAT THAT THERE'S A I GREW UP IN THE MIDWEST THERE'S A REASON WHY STATES IN THE MIDWEST SUCH AS MINNESOTA NEED TO DEVOTE. FAR MORE RESOURCE TO TRACK BUSINESS THERE THAN CALIFORNIA DOM. WELL BUT THAT'S JUST JUST A COMMENT YOU DON'T NEED THE ONLY RESPOND TO THAT WELL IT. IT'S TRUE -- WE HAVE SOME -- GEOGRAPHIC ADVANTAGES THAT ARE AMAZING AND BUT WE ARE LOSING SHARE SO THOSE ARE THE FACTS -- I CAN APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THERE I SERVED ON THE LA CONVENTION VISITORS -- BOARD -- FOR MANY MANY YEARS. AND LOS ANGELES BEING WELL KNOWN THROUGHOUT THE WORLD BEGAN TO SORT OF KICK BACK. AND JUST LET OUR REPUTATION. YES AND WE BEGAN TO SUFFER BECAUSE WE WEREN'T PAYING ATTENTION TO THE GROWING COMPETITION. FOR TOURISM IN CITIES AND STATES THROUGHOUT THE THE COUNTRY SO WE HAD TO REALLY CHANGE GEARS. AND BE MUCH MUCH PROACTIVE IN FAX -- SET UP -- OFFICES IN SEVERAL OTHER COUNTRIES JUST FOR LOS ANGELES -- AND SO IT AND IT REALLY STARTED TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE AT LEAST WE WEREN'T. PERCENTAGE WISE WE WEREN'T BEGINNING WE'RE WE'RE NO LONGER LOSING WHAT WE HAD BEEN BEFORE SO. I CAN APPRECIATE THAT SOMETIMES YOU TAKE. OR HIGHER POSITION FOR GRANTED AS A FOR ALWAYS GOING TO BE THERE AS IF THERE'S NO MORE COMPETITION IN THE WORLD SO HE HAS -- CHARTER ALSO IF I COULD JUST MAKE ONE COMMENT ON THAT. VISIT CALIFORNIA WHICH IS OUR SORT OF BECAUSE I STATE ORGANIZATION THAT RAISES ITS MONEY FROM THE INDUSTRY AND IS BASICALLY GOVERNED BY THE INDUSTRY. THEY WERE SPENDING ABOUT FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR UP UNTIL FIVE YEARS AGO AND CAROL INVITADA WENT TO ALL OF IT THE INDUSTRY MEMBERS AND SAID. WE'RE STARTING TO LOSE SHARE IN OUR CHARISM. AND SHE ASKED THE MEMBERS TO DOUBLE. THEIR ASSESSMENT AND THEY DID AND NOW -- VISIT CALIFORNIA HAS ABOUT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION DOLLAR BUDGET GREW HUNDRED AND THEN THE ECONOMY IS CONTINUE TO MAKE A CO OP. BUT THAT'S THE KIND OF A PROACTIVE EFFORT THAT WE NEED WHEN WE SEE OUR SHARE LOSSES TO SAY WE CAN'T LET ALLOW THIS THING IT. COULD TO CONTINUE IF WE WANT TO HAVE THE RIGHT JOBS IN CALIFORNIA [inaudible] OKAY. SENATOR ENDING. ANYMORE QUESTIONS COMMENTS. WELL YOU KNOW I CAN HAVE A LONG HISTORY GOING BACK TO THE EIGHTIES ACTUALLY CARING LEGISLATION SETTING UP. ADDITIONAL AND THEN I THINK WE ONLY HAD. THREE TRADE OFFICES MADE GREAT SENSE. I THINK THEY HAD VALUE. AS TIMES HAVE INVOLVED THOUGH. THE EDGE EXIT IN CIRCUMSTANCES THAT -- AFFECT OUR TRADE POSITION. IN THE WORLD OUR MEANING CALIFORNIA. ARE A HECK OF A LOT MORE RELATED. TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND ITS POLICIES GENERALLY. DOES NOT FRIENDLY [inaudible] THIS. AND OVER REGULATION. THE FOURTH BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT BEING TOO OPPRESSIVE. AND THOSE SIGNALS THAT ARE NOT LOST ON FOREIGN COUNTRIES AS WELL. I ONLY INTERJECT THAT NOT SPECIFICALLY TO THIS ATTEMPT. BUT IF WE CALIFORNIA ARE GOING TO GET AHEAD WE'VE GOT TO ADDRESS THIS MORE MACRO. AND MORE INGRAINED [inaudible] ISSUE. OF HOW WEAK CALIFORNIA CHOOSE [inaudible] TO REGULATE. AND MANAGE BUSINESS. OKAY -- POOL THANK YOU VERY MUCH LET CAN I HEAR A MOTION -- PUBLIC I'M SORRY I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT EARLIER WHEN I I HAD AN OLDER -- ANYHOW ASSISTANCE WILL CORPORATE BY ROUGHLY. EIGHTY BUT AGAIN WE HAVE SO CALLED VALLEY LEADERSHIP GROUP IN THE KELLY XIN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE FOR MUCH IN SUPPORT. AND ON BEHALF OF THE ALLOCATION CHAMBER JUST WANNA. MENTION THAT EXPORTING ABROAD IS HARD ENOUGH ALREADY FOR EVERYDAY BUSINESS IS A FULL TIME DEDICATED STAFF TO DIRECTLY FACILITATE TRADE TO OUR STATE'S LARGEST. GLOBAL GLOBAL MARKETS IS CRITICAL NOT ONLY FOR THE BUSINESSES WE REPRESENT BUT ESPECIALLY BURNER ECONOMY IS LARGE AND GLOBALLY DIVERSE AS OURS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WE DO HAVE A LOT TO EXPORT OUT THE WAY YES WE DO. AND THAT'S FOR OUR BUSINESSES HERE YES -- ALREADY HERE. OKAY OF IF NO MORE QUESTIONS -- THEN I'LL HEAR A MOTION TO APPROVE AS BUDGET IS SO MOVED [inaudible] ROLL CALL. THIRD RAZA HI THERE NIELSEN. SENATOR UMBERG [inaudible] OKAY. THANK YOU THANK YOU.
