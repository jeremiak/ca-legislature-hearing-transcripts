IMPORTANCE OF CHILD CARE EARLY

00:16:48.474 --> 00:16:50.843
LEARNING FOR CHILDREN. I'VE HAD

00:16:50.909 --> 00:16:52.111
A LONG ISSUE WITH BEING ON THE

00:16:52.177 --> 00:16:53.812
WAIT LIST I WAS A WORKING

00:16:53.879 --> 00:16:55.581
PROFESSIONAL HIGHER EDUCATION.

00:16:55.647 --> 00:16:58.117
UNTIL SIX YEARS AGO WHEN I

00:16:58.183 --> 00:16:59.752
STARTED PLANNING FOR A FAMILY.

00:16:59.818 --> 00:17:00.786
I WAS BLESSED TO BECOME A

00:17:00.853 --> 00:17:02.454
MOTHER TO A BOY YEARS AGO SIX

00:17:02.521 --> 00:17:04.323
YEARS AGO AND I WAS ABLE TO

00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:04.923
WORK PART TIME EVEN AFTER MY

00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:06.925
MATERNITY LEAVE. AND I ARRANGED

00:17:06.992 --> 00:17:08.627
FOR AFFORDABLE CHILD CARE FOR

00:17:08.694 --> 00:17:11.497
HIM ON A PART TIME BASIS.

00:17:11.563 --> 00:17:12.531
EVERYTHING WAS FINE UNTIL I

00:17:12.598 --> 00:17:14.099
BECAME PREGNANT WITH MY SECOND

00:17:14.166 --> 00:17:16.301
CHILD WHICH WASN'T PLANNED. BUT

00:17:16.368 --> 00:17:17.736
YEAH MY JOB VALUED ME SO MUCH

00:17:17.803 --> 00:17:19.304
THAT I HAD A FLEXIBILITY WITH

00:17:19.371 --> 00:17:20.539
MY WORK SCHEDULE WHEN I HAD

00:17:20.606 --> 00:17:21.540
WENT AHEAD AND WENT ON MY

00:17:21.607 --> 00:17:23.642
MATERNITY LEAVE. I STRUGGLED TO

00:17:23.709 --> 00:17:26.345
FIND AFFORDABLE ACCESSIBLE AND

00:17:26.412 --> 00:17:27.513
QUALITY CHILDCARE FOR TRUE BABY.

00:17:27.579 --> 00:17:29.415
SO I MADE A HARD LIFE DECISION

00:17:29.481 --> 00:17:31.550
TO GIVE UP MY CAREER. I GAVE UP

00:17:31.617 --> 00:17:34.486
NO I GAVE MY NOTICE. I SOLD MY

00:17:34.553 --> 00:17:35.053
HOME AND I MOVED TO ANOTHER

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:38.590
CITY. INTO WITH MY FROM MY

00:17:38.657 --> 00:17:39.158
HUSBAND'S FAMILY DUE TO MAKE

00:17:39.224 --> 00:17:41.527
ENDS MEET. THE LACK OF

00:17:41.593 --> 00:17:43.262
AFFORDABILITY ACCESSIBILITY AND

00:17:43.328 --> 00:17:44.463
AVAILABILITY OF CHILD CARE

00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:45.864
WHAT'S THE REASON FOR ME TO

00:17:45.931 --> 00:17:47.599
BECOME A STAY HOME MOM. I WAS

00:17:47.666 --> 00:17:49.401
LIVING WITH ONE WORKING ADULT

00:17:49.468 --> 00:17:51.069
THE TWO DISABLED ELDERLY WOMEN

00:17:51.136 --> 00:17:53.772
AND TWO BABIES. AND I LIVING IN

00:17:53.839 --> 00:17:55.707
A TWO BEDROOM APARTMENT SIX OF

00:17:55.774 --> 00:17:58.644
US THAT INCREASED OUR STRESS

00:17:58.710 --> 00:17:59.244
LEVELS AND AFFECTED MY MENTAL

00:17:59.311 --> 00:18:02.247
HEALTH. THREE YEARS AGO IWAS

00:18:02.314 --> 00:18:02.848
OFFERED A JOB AS AN ESSENTIAL

00:18:02.915 --> 00:18:05.350
WORKER. AND THAT'S WHEN I

00:18:05.417 --> 00:18:07.252
DECIDED TO MAKE A CHILD TRAPPED

00:18:07.319 --> 00:18:09.087
THE CASE FOR MY CHILDREN. I

00:18:09.154 --> 00:18:11.423
WANTED TO FOCUS ON MY WORK

00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:11.990
HOWEVER I WAS PLACED ON THE

00:18:12.057 --> 00:18:14.393
WAITLIST. AND AS A PANDEMIC

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:16.428
BEGAN THE PERSON THAT TOOK CARE

00:18:16.495 --> 00:18:17.963
OF NEEDED MORE OF MY ATTENTION.

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:21.333
AND UNFORTUNATELY MY SON WAS

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:22.901
DIAGNOSED WITH SPECIAL NEEDS SO

00:18:22.968 --> 00:18:25.037
HE NEEDED ME TO. SO I HAD TO

00:18:25.103 --> 00:18:26.839
QUIT MY JOB AGAIN DUE TO THE

00:18:26.905 --> 00:18:28.440
LACK OF HEALTH CARE I COULDN'T

00:18:28.507 --> 00:18:30.576
GET MY FIVE YEAR OLD CHILD CARE

00:18:30.642 --> 00:18:31.743
OR INTO AN EARLY LEARNING

00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:33.645
PROGRAM HE HAS NOW STARTED

00:18:33.712 --> 00:18:35.647
KINDERGARTEN. LAST YEAR AND

00:18:35.714 --> 00:18:37.683
HE'S BEEN HE WAS DOING IT.

00:18:37.749 --> 00:18:40.285
ONLINE AND- HE JUST STARTED IN

00:18:40.352 --> 00:18:42.087
PERSON LEARNING TWO THREE WEEKS

00:18:42.154 --> 00:18:43.889
AGO AND HE'S BEHIND

00:18:43.956 --> 00:18:44.456
ACADEMICALLY EMOTIONALLY AND

00:18:44.523 --> 00:18:49.394
SOCIALLY. HE LAST WEEK GOT A

00:18:49.461 --> 00:18:51.196
COLD AND SO I SUBMITTED HIM

00:18:51.263 --> 00:18:52.965
INTO A CORPORATE TEST TO GO

00:18:53.031 --> 00:18:54.633
BACK TO SCHOOL BECAUSE THAT'S

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:56.468
WHEN OTHER PROTOCOL. OR YOU

00:18:56.535 --> 00:18:58.937
HAVE TO QUARANTINE SO I HAD TO

00:18:59.004 --> 00:19:00.672
TAKE THE TEST HE WAS NEGATIVE

00:19:00.739 --> 00:19:02.307
SO MY CONCERN WAS MAKING SURE

00:19:02.374 --> 00:19:05.577
THAT THE SCHOOL HAD. THE

00:19:05.644 --> 00:19:07.479
PROTOCOL THE PROPER FOR HIM TO

00:19:07.546 --> 00:19:09.348
GO BACK TO SCHOOL SAFELY. THE

00:19:09.414 --> 00:19:12.150
FASHION PPO SUPPLIES. SO THAT

00:19:12.217 --> 00:19:14.453
I'M NOT CONCERNED OF. I'M CLING

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:17.055
FINANCE. AND ENVIRONMENT SCHOOL

00:19:17.122 --> 00:19:20.726
ENVIRONMENT. BUT HE CAN'T DRIVE

00:19:20.792 --> 00:19:21.960
JOIN ONLINE LEARNING STYLE IN

00:19:22.027 --> 00:19:23.395
PERSON LEARNING IS THE ONLY WAY

00:19:23.462 --> 00:19:24.830
THAT HE WILL BE ABLE TO LEARN

00:19:24.897 --> 00:19:26.665
AND GROW AND THAT'S- THE ONLY

00:19:26.732 --> 00:19:27.266
OPTION THAT I HAVE FOR HIM. TO

00:19:27.332 --> 00:19:31.537
LEARN. SO THAT'S THE RISK BUT

00:19:31.603 --> 00:19:33.939
I'M TAKING WITH HIM. AND RIGHT

00:19:34.006 --> 00:19:35.207
NOW I'M CURRENTLY ON THE WAIT

00:19:35.274 --> 00:19:36.341
LIST FOR MY FOUR YEAR OLD TO

00:19:36.408 --> 00:19:37.543
GET CHILD CARE WHICH I HOPE

00:19:37.609 --> 00:19:39.311
THAT SHE GETS PLACEMENTS. I

00:19:39.378 --> 00:19:40.078
APPLIED WITH THE SCHOOL

00:19:40.145 --> 00:19:41.713
DISTRICT TO GET MY DAUGHTER

00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:43.916
INTO A TEACHING PROGRAM. AND

00:19:43.982 --> 00:19:44.850
THE SAN FRANCISCO UNIFIED

00:19:44.917 --> 00:19:45.984
SCHOOL DISTRICT HAS LIMITED

00:19:46.051 --> 00:19:47.986
TICKETS GOALS. SO IT'S NOT EVEN

00:19:48.053 --> 00:19:50.789
A- REQUIREMENT. OF WHAT I WAS

00:19:50.856 --> 00:19:52.658
TOLD THAT A FOUR YEAR OLD. TO

00:19:52.724 --> 00:19:54.126
GET INTO AN EARLY LEARNING

00:19:54.192 --> 00:19:55.928
PROGRAM. SO I HAVE A HUGE FEAR

00:19:55.994 --> 00:19:58.797
OF NOT. IN MY CHILD CARE FOR MY

00:19:58.864 --> 00:20:01.433
DAUGHTER. EITHER ENTITY K.

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:03.902
PROGRAM OR INTO EARLY LEARNING

00:20:03.969 --> 00:20:05.304
AND HAVE HER STRUGGLING LIKE MY

00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:08.640
SON IS NOW. SO THE LACK OF

00:20:08.707 --> 00:20:10.142
AFFORDABILITY AND THE ACCESS IS

00:20:10.208 --> 00:20:13.645
REAL. MAKING SURE FAMILIES ARE

00:20:13.712 --> 00:20:14.580
NOT ON THE WAITING LIST FOR

00:20:14.646 --> 00:20:16.348
VERY LONG AND ONCE THEY GET

00:20:16.415 --> 00:20:19.351
PLACED. THEY HAVE THEIR FEES

00:20:19.418 --> 00:20:22.521
WAIT. FOR STRUGGLING FAMILIES

00:20:22.588 --> 00:20:25.691
LIKE MINE. BECAUSE IT'S HARD

00:20:25.757 --> 00:20:26.291
ENOUGH BUT DEMOCRATS ONLY MADE

00:20:26.358 --> 00:20:28.327
IT WORSE. HAVING TO CHOOSE

00:20:28.393 --> 00:20:29.861
BETWEEN BEING A PARENT AND

00:20:29.928 --> 00:20:30.929
WORKING IS NOT SOMETHING THAT

00:20:30.996 --> 00:20:32.698
ANYBODY SHOULD GO THROUGH ALSO

00:20:32.764 --> 00:20:34.232
STRUGGLING FINANCIALLY TO

00:20:34.299 --> 00:20:35.601
PROVIDE ALONG WITH PAYING FOR

00:20:35.667 --> 00:20:37.536
CHILD CARE AND FAMILY FEEDS CAN

00:20:37.603 --> 00:20:39.504
POSE A HUGE BURDEN. THANKS FOR

00:20:39.571 --> 00:20:40.973
STAYING HOME BECAUSE OF THE

00:20:41.039 --> 00:20:43.008
LACK OF AFFORDABLE QUALITY.

00:20:43.075 --> 00:20:44.743
ACCESSIBLE CHILD CARE AND THE

00:20:44.810 --> 00:20:47.346
MENTAL STRESS IS WHAT THAT IS

00:20:47.412 --> 00:20:47.946
SOMETHING THAT A PARENT SHOULD

00:20:48.013 --> 00:20:49.181
GO THROUGH EITHER. PARENTS

00:20:49.247 --> 00:20:50.382
SHOULD HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE

00:20:50.449 --> 00:20:52.017
NECESSITIES THE BASIC

00:20:52.084 --> 00:20:53.585
NECESSITIES LONG CHILD CARE

00:20:53.652 --> 00:20:56.254
WAITLISTS FAMILY FEEDS. FOR THE

00:20:56.321 --> 00:20:57.990
CONCERN THAT QUALITY CHILD CARE

00:20:58.056 --> 00:21:00.292
AND A LACK OF PORTABILITY CARE.

00:28:20.365 --> 00:28:21.766
ENROLLMENT DURING THE AFTERMATH

00:28:21.833 --> 00:28:23.902
OF THE OUTBREAK WE ARE IN SUCH

00:28:23.968 --> 00:28:26.571
AN EINER STABLE SITUATION RIGHT

00:28:26.638 --> 00:28:28.506
NOW. AND WE REALLY NEED TO

00:28:28.573 --> 00:28:29.874
ENSURE THAT THESE PROGRAMS ARE

00:28:29.941 --> 00:28:32.577

PERMANENTLY THAT WOULD BE

00:28:40.318 --> 00:28:41.786
FRIENDLY TO FAMILIES AND

00:28:41.853 --> 00:28:43.822
PROVIDE STABILITY TO PROVIDERS.

STILL HAVING OPENING ENCLOSURE

00:29:08.746 --> 00:29:11.149

TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. I'M ALSO

00:29:12.984 --> 00:29:14.085

REFERENCED BY DONNA SALINGER.

00:29:17.822 --> 00:29:18.990

COST DIFFERENCE SAYS. I NEED

00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:41.045
ANOTHER PERMANENT CHANGE- THAT

00:29:41.112 --> 00:29:42.247

THIRD OF ITS CHILD CARE CENTERS

00:34:48.386 --> 00:34:50.455

IN SOME COUNTIES THOSE NUMBERS

00:34:52.056 --> 00:34:54.125

DIFFICULTIES. AND WE ALSO KNOW

00:49:20.424 --> 00:49:21.091
THAT- A LOT OF OUR CHILD CARE

00:49:21.158 --> 00:49:23.193
WORKERS. AND SUBSTRATE SHALL

00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:24.261
CARE ARE SOME OF THE VERY

00:49:24.328 --> 00:49:25.929
PEOPLE WHO WERE IMPACTED THE

00:49:25.996 --> 00:49:26.897
WORST MICHAEL WOULD TEND TO BE

00:49:26.963 --> 00:49:28.699
PEOPLE WITH. AS KNOW WE

00:49:28.765 --> 00:49:29.900
DON'T PAY VERY WELL LOWER

00:49:29.966 --> 00:49:32.035
SOCIAL ECONOMIC- AS WELL AS

00:49:32.102 --> 00:49:33.303
OFTENTIMES PEOPLE OF COLOR WHO

00:49:33.370 --> 00:49:34.938
ARE OVERWHELMINGLY THOSE ALSO

00:49:35.005 --> 00:49:37.441
IMPACTED BY. BY COVERT AND

00:49:37.507 --> 00:49:39.676
HEALTH RELATED ISSUES SO- I

00:49:39.743 --> 00:49:41.545
THINK IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE

00:49:41.611 --> 00:49:42.846
THAT WE BUILD OUR CHILD CARE

00:49:42.913 --> 00:49:44.848
SYSTEM BACKED. UP SOME OF THIS

00:49:44.915 --> 00:49:45.816
ONE TIME FUNDING GOING FOR

00:49:45.882 --> 00:49:46.817
FACILITIES AT A POTENTIALLY

00:49:46.883 --> 00:49:48.852
CLOSER OR HAVE NEEDED TO REHAB

00:49:48.919 --> 00:49:50.787
IS IMPERATIVE. AND I GUESS THE

00:49:50.854 --> 00:49:51.988
ONLY QUESTION I WOULD HAVE FOR

00:49:52.055 --> 00:49:54.224
SOME OF THE PANELIST IS- AND I

00:49:54.291 --> 00:49:55.292
THINK WE'RE ALL SUPPORTIVE OF

00:49:55.359 --> 00:49:57.694
T. K. BUT NOT AT THE EXPENSE OF

00:49:57.761 --> 00:49:58.762
OUR CHILD CARE SLOTS BECAUSE WE

00:49:58.829 --> 00:50:00.330
KNOW. AS MUCH AS PEOPLE HAVE

00:50:00.397 --> 00:50:01.398
POINTED OUT THAT THEY'RE NOT

00:50:01.465 --> 00:50:02.599
JUST EIGHT TO FIVE DURING THE

00:50:02.666 --> 00:50:04.267
DAY WHEN. SOMEONE'S GOING TO AN

00:50:04.334 --> 00:50:06.036
OFFICE TO WORK BUT THEY ARE.

00:50:06.103 --> 00:50:08.839
AROUND THE CLOCK AND ARE LOWER.

00:50:08.905 --> 00:50:10.040
OR LOWER WAGE WORKERS ARE

00:50:10.107 --> 00:50:11.341
SERVICE INDUSTRY HAVE TO BE

00:50:11.408 --> 00:50:13.410
ABLE TO HAVE A CHILD HERE

00:50:13.477 --> 00:50:14.211
SOMEWHERE. SO I GUESS I WOULD

00:50:14.277 --> 00:50:16.046
JUST ASK HOW I KNEW THE

00:50:16.113 --> 00:50:16.646
PANELISTS IF THEY CAN TALK

00:50:16.713 --> 00:50:19.316
ABOUT. THEIR THINKING ABOUT

00:50:19.383 --> 00:50:23.854
MORE CHILD CARE SLOTS VERSUS. A

00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:26.857
UNIVERSAL T. K. WHO WOULD LIKE

00:50:26.923 --> 00:50:29.259
TO TAKE THAT FIRST OKAY. ALSO

00:50:29.326 --> 00:50:31.328
ALL STAR AND THEN I'M SURE NINA

00:50:31.395 --> 00:50:34.064
WILL. JUMP IN AND I APPRECIATE

00:50:34.131 --> 00:50:36.366
THE QUESTION AND- I THINK WE

00:50:36.433 --> 00:50:39.503
ARE ALL. CONCERNED THAT THIS IS

00:50:39.569 --> 00:50:41.571
A REALLY CRITICAL TIMES FOR OUR

00:50:41.638 --> 00:50:44.007
CHILD CARE SYSTEM. WHICH SERVES

00:50:44.074 --> 00:50:46.143
ALL CHILDREN. ZERO THROUGH

00:50:46.209 --> 00:50:48.311
TWELVE NOT JUST ONE AGE GROUP.

00:50:48.378 --> 00:50:50.313
AND THAT WE KNOW THAT OUR

00:50:50.380 --> 00:50:52.916
FAMILIES NEED CHOICE. AND

00:50:52.983 --> 00:50:55.719
CALIFORNIA IS- LARGE DIVERSE

00:50:55.786 --> 00:50:58.088
STATE. IT IS NOT A ONE SIZE

00:50:58.155 --> 00:51:00.757
FITS ALL STATE. AND I THINK

00:51:00.824 --> 00:51:02.659
THAT CONCERNS MANY OF US HAVE

00:51:02.726 --> 00:51:03.427
WITH THE TRANSITIONAL

00:51:03.493 --> 00:51:05.595
KINDERGARTEN PROPOSAL. IS IT

00:51:05.662 --> 00:51:08.165
TAKES THE PARENT CHOICE OUT.

00:51:08.231 --> 00:51:10.200
AND GIVES THEM A ONE SIZE FITS

00:51:10.267 --> 00:51:12.602
ALL APPROACH AT THE LOCAL

00:51:12.669 --> 00:51:15.705
LEVEL. SO I THINK THAT WE ALL

00:51:15.772 --> 00:51:17.808
APPRECIATE THAT THE T. K.

00:51:17.874 --> 00:51:19.743
SERVICES CAN BE PART OF A

00:51:19.810 --> 00:51:21.611
BROADER PRESCHOOL SYSTEM

00:51:21.678 --> 00:51:23.113
UNIVERSAL PRE SCHOOL SYSTEM IN

00:51:23.180 --> 00:51:25.115
THE STATE. BUT IT'S CRITICALLY

00:51:25.182 --> 00:51:26.249
IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE A MIXED

00:51:26.316 --> 00:51:28.118
A LIVERY MODEL AND WHEN YOU

00:51:28.185 --> 00:51:30.620
LOOK AT OTHER STATES. THAT HAVE

00:51:30.687 --> 00:51:32.556
IMPLEMENTED SIMILAR PROGRAMS

00:51:32.622 --> 00:51:35.325
THEY HAVE DONE IT. IN CONCERT

00:51:35.392 --> 00:51:38.595
WITH. THEIR CHILD CARE SYSTEM

00:51:38.662 --> 00:51:40.230
AND LIFTED UP THEIR CHILD CARE

00:51:40.297 --> 00:51:42.666
SYSTEM RATHER THAN HELD IT DOWN

00:51:42.732 --> 00:51:46.970
AND DIMINISHED IT. AND THAT

00:51:47.037 --> 00:51:47.737
INCLUDED. CHILD CARE CENTER

00:51:47.804 --> 00:51:51.408
FAMILY CHILD CARE AND ALSO OUR-

00:51:51.475 --> 00:51:52.375
OUR FAMILY FRIENDS AND

00:51:52.442 --> 00:51:53.443
NEIGHBORS WHO'S BEEN FILLING A

00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:55.779
GOOD DEAL OF THE GAP. DURING

00:51:55.846 --> 00:51:58.582
THIS CRISIS SO I THINK IT'S

00:51:58.648 --> 00:52:00.183
IMPORTANT THAT WE GET THE CHILD

00:52:00.250 --> 00:52:02.652

00:52:02.719 --> 00:52:04.921

00:52:11.561 --> 00:52:12.896
IMPORTANT THING AND HAVING A

00:52:14.698 --> 00:52:16.666
IMPORTANT THING. SO THAT WE CAN

00:52:18.435 --> 00:52:19.870

TO BRING THE REIMBURSEMENT RATE

01:00:30.093 --> 01:00:32.128
FOR PROVIDERS UP TO THE MOST

01:00:32.195 --> 01:00:34.163
RECENT SURVEY. WHICH I BELIEVE

01:00:34.230 --> 01:00:36.065
WAS IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN

01:00:36.132 --> 01:00:37.367
AND I BELIEVE DO WE EVER

BURN UPDATED SURVEY. THE THIRD

01:00:53.116 --> 01:00:54.650

DUE TO THE PANDEMIC SO IT WAS.

01:01:00.189 --> 01:01:02.291

01:01:12.869 --> 01:01:14.871
REGIONAL MARKET RATE- AND

01:01:14.937 --> 01:01:19.275

01:01:21.511 --> 01:01:22.845
MY FILES IN THIS MOMENT WHICH

01:01:22.912 --> 01:01:24.313
IS PROBABLY NOT A GREAT. GREAT

01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:29.352
IDEA- BUT I GUESS IT. WOULD

01:01:29.419 --> 01:01:30.053
DEPEND ON WHAT KIND OF. WHAT

01:01:35.191 --> 01:01:36.025
MOVE TO THE MOST RECENT

01:01:36.092 --> 01:01:37.527
SURVEYING KEEP AT THE SEVENTY

01:01:37.593 --> 01:01:39.829
FIFTH PERCENTILE- BUT THERE'S

01:01:39.896 --> 01:01:41.230
ALSO I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT SOME

01:01:41.297 --> 01:01:42.765
LEGISLATIVE INTENT LANGUAGE TO

MOVE G. EIGHTY FIFTH PERCENTILE

01:01:44.267 --> 01:01:45.501
SO THAT WOULD BE AN ADDITIONAL

01:01:45.568 --> 01:01:47.870
COST TO JUST MOVING TO THE MOST

01:01:47.937 --> 01:01:49.972

OF TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS.

01:02:01.517 --> 01:02:03.286
OBVIOUSLY MOVING UP TO THE

01:02:03.352 --> 01:02:04.187
EIGHTY FIFTH WOULD BE SLIGHTLY

01:02:04.253 --> 01:02:06.389
HIGHER. AND THEN- THE

01:02:06.456 --> 01:02:08.157
IMPLEMENTATION OF RATE REFORM

01:02:08.224 --> 01:02:10.026
OVER TIME WOULD MOVE ALL

01:02:10.093 --> 01:02:13.463
PROVIDERS- THAT INTO A HIGHER

01:02:13.529 --> 01:02:17.300

OF THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN SURVEY

01:02:28.744 --> 01:02:29.979
WOULD COST TWO HUNDRED AND

01:02:30.046 --> 01:02:31.114
TWENTY SEVEN MILLION- AND

01:02:31.180 --> 01:02:32.081
MOVING TO THE EIGHTY FIFTH

01:02:32.148 --> 01:02:33.916
PERCENTILE THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN

01:02:33.983 --> 01:02:35.351
SURVEY IT'S FIVE HUNDRED SIXTY

01:02:35.418 --> 01:02:35.852
MILLION AND THAT'S NOT

PERCENTILE THAT WOULD BE

01:03:00.810 --> 01:03:02.945
ADDITIONAL FINES THAT WE WOULD

01:03:03.012 --> 01:03:06.582

ISSUES JUST REMAIN THE SAME

01:07:17.333 --> 01:07:18.567
WHETHER PAYING WORKERS

THESE THINGS UP TO MAKE A BIG

01:08:03.045 --> 01:08:05.047

HELPFUL RESOURCE. HOWEVER I'LL

01:45:40.600 --> 01:45:41.735

01:50:59.152 --> 01:51:02.155

OF STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA.

01:51:48.368 --> 01:51:50.103
URGENCY OF NEED IS EXACTLY WHY

01:51:50.170 --> 01:51:51.571
OUR COALITION IN SUPPORTING THE

SCHOOLS AND COUNTIES WHO

01:52:01.581 --> 01:52:03.016

CONTRACTS WITH THE SCHOOLS

01:52:18.465 --> 01:52:20.700
QUICKLY. AN INVESTMENT OF

01:52:20.767 --> 01:52:21.968
EIGHTY POINT FIVE MILLION WILL

01:52:22.035 --> 01:52:24.104

ANOTHER THING THAT WE COULD DO

01:52:35.482 --> 01:52:37.250
VERY QUICKLY IS TO INVEST IN

02:03:52.858 --> 02:03:53.926
THEN ROLL THEM UP INTO A

02:03:53.993 --> 02:03:55.094
STATEWIDE YOU KNOW I. T.

02:03:55.161 --> 02:03:57.429
PLATFORMS WITH BUILT. SEVENTY

02:03:57.496 --> 02:03:58.330
THAT DOES REQUIRE PROCUREMENT

02:03:58.397 --> 02:04:00.132
AND SO FORTH. BUT THINKING

02:04:00.199 --> 02:04:01.300
ABOUT HOW WE BUILD SOME OF THIS

02:04:01.367 --> 02:04:02.701
STUFF A LITTLE BIT PARALLEL

02:04:02.768 --> 02:04:04.436
RAKES SO WE HAVE MENTAL HEALTH

02:04:04.503 --> 02:04:05.437
PROFESSIONALS WHO MIGHT BE ABLE

02:04:05.504 --> 02:04:08.274
TO- YOU KNOW. USING SOME.

02:04:08.340 --> 02:04:09.875
CERTAIN PLACES SOME REASON.

02:04:09.942 --> 02:04:11.377
SOME EXISTING PLATFORMS

02:04:11.443 --> 02:04:12.278
ETCETERA SAID WE'VE BEEN

02:04:12.344 --> 02:04:13.546
BUILDING OUT SOME TELEHEALTH

02:04:13.612 --> 02:04:15.815
STUFF SO FAR MAYBE THERE'S- SO

02:04:15.881 --> 02:04:18.017
IT JUST WANTED TO. THINK A

02:04:18.083 --> 02:04:19.351
LITTLE MORE CREATIVELY IN TERMS

02:04:19.418 --> 02:04:21.654
OF. HOW DO WE TRY TO. GET

02:04:21.720 --> 02:04:23.422
SERVICES TO PEOPLE MORE QUICKLY

02:04:23.489 --> 02:04:24.990
AND ACTUALLY EVEN AND IN THE

02:04:25.057 --> 02:04:25.791
PROCESS OF DOING SOME OF THESE

02:04:25.858 --> 02:04:27.493
OTHER THINGS. WE'RE GOING TO

02:04:27.560 --> 02:04:28.694
SERVE THESE ARE ALMOST LIKE

02:04:28.761 --> 02:04:30.095
PILOTY TYPE THINGS BECAUSE

02:04:30.162 --> 02:04:31.497
MAYBE LEARN SOMETHING THAT MAY

02:04:31.564 --> 02:04:32.698
BE USEFUL AS WE BUILD OUT THE

02:04:32.765 --> 02:04:34.233
LARGER STATEWIDE SYSTEM.

02:04:34.300 --> 02:04:35.501
BECAUSE WE'VE ACTUALLY HAD AN

02:04:35.568 --> 02:04:36.435
OPPORTUNITY TO TEST SOME OF

02:04:36.502 --> 02:04:38.470
THESE THINGS OUT AND- ON A

02:04:38.537 --> 02:04:41.140
SMALLER SCALE PERHAPS BUT-

02:04:41.207 --> 02:04:43.442
USING EXISTING PLATFORMS. YES

02:04:43.509 --> 02:04:45.311
SO I THINK- IT'S GOING TO BE-

02:04:45.377 --> 02:04:46.612
SO THERE ARE SOME OF THE PIECES

02:04:46.679 --> 02:04:47.746
BUT THEN THE PROPOSAL DO YOU

02:04:47.813 --> 02:04:50.950
START- EARLIER RIGHT. A LOT OF

02:04:51.016 --> 02:04:52.051
THE WORK FORCE INFRASTRUCTURE

02:04:52.117 --> 02:04:53.786
STARTS BEFORE THAT. VIRTUAL

02:04:53.853 --> 02:04:55.154
PLATFORM HAT WE WERE TALKING

02:04:55.221 --> 02:04:56.689
ABOUT WOULD LAUNCH TO MAKE SURE

02:04:56.755 --> 02:04:58.357
THAT THE WORK FORCE. MARKET YOU

02:04:58.424 --> 02:04:59.758
KNOW. MOVING FORWARD AS SOON AS

02:04:59.825 --> 02:05:01.627
POSSIBLE. ON THE-

02:05:01.694 --> 02:05:03.329
INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE SCHOOLING

02:05:03.395 --> 02:05:05.264
TO GRANTS WOULD GO UP EARLIER-

02:05:05.331 --> 02:05:06.365
BECAUSE YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE

02:05:06.432 --> 02:05:07.132
YOUR BUILDING THAT

02:05:07.199 --> 02:05:07.967
INFRASTRUCTURE WITH THE

02:05:08.033 --> 02:05:09.268
COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS

02:05:09.335 --> 02:05:10.769
AND- CONNECTING THE PLANS TO

02:05:10.836 --> 02:05:12.504
THE SCHOOLS. WOULD BE YOU KNOW

02:05:12.571 --> 02:05:14.373
IN ADVANCE TO LAUNCHING KIND OF

02:05:14.440 --> 02:05:15.875
THE STATE WIDE NETWORKS OF

02:05:15.941 --> 02:05:17.476
THOSE PIECES WOULD BE HAPPENING

02:05:17.543 --> 02:05:19.912
PRIOR TO YOU. AS WELL AS-

02:05:19.979 --> 02:05:21.280
EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICE GRANTS

02:05:21.347 --> 02:05:23.515
SO IDENTIFYING WHICH EVIDENCE

02:05:23.582 --> 02:05:25.618

TO THAT KIND OF STATE OR

02:05:32.091 --> 02:05:34.260
STATEWIDE PLATFORM. AND THEN.

02:05:34.326 --> 02:05:35.895
IN ADDITION TO THAT I THINK

02:05:35.961 --> 02:05:36.695
THAT THEY HAVE A WHOLE

02:05:36.762 --> 02:05:38.297
CONTINUUM. WHERE WE'RE NEEDING

02:05:38.364 --> 02:05:42.902
THE ACTUAL. BRICK AND MORTAR

02:05:42.968 --> 02:05:43.502
PIECES THOSE WOULD BE STARTING

02:05:43.569 --> 02:05:44.103
IN ADVANCE OF A LOT OF BLIND.

02:05:44.169 --> 02:05:45.070

START. THAT FOUNDATION THAT

02:05:46.605 --> 02:05:48.207
BASE. GETTING THE INVESTMENT

02:05:48.274 --> 02:05:50.075
OUT STATEWIDE. TO EVENTUALLY

02:05:50.142 --> 02:05:51.977
THEN TAP INTO THAT INTO THE

02:05:52.044 --> 02:05:53.812
VIRTUAL PLATFORMS OF WHERE

02:05:53.879 --> 02:05:55.180
THOSE DIRECT SERVICES CAN BE

02:05:55.247 --> 02:05:56.815
PROVIDED THE LINKS AND THE-

02:05:56.882 --> 02:05:59.218
CONNECTIONS TO. THOSE REFERRALS

02:05:59.285 --> 02:06:00.219
BUT WE'LL DEFINITELY TAKE THAT

02:06:00.286 --> 02:06:01.687
FEEDBACK BACK IN REGARDS TO

02:06:01.754 --> 02:06:04.490
YOU. EVEN SOME OF THE- YOU KNOW

02:06:04.556 --> 02:06:05.824
YOU CONSUL IN OTHER PIECES HOW

02:06:11.931 --> 02:06:13.332
OKAY I APPRECIATE THAT AND THEN

02:06:13.399 --> 02:06:14.366
ALSO YOU TALK ABOUT THE PUBLIC

02:06:14.433 --> 02:06:15.834
EDUCATION CAMPAIGN I ASSUME

02:06:15.901 --> 02:06:17.436
THAT SOMETHING YOU CAN EARLIER

02:06:17.503 --> 02:06:20.005
THAN LATER- BECAUSE- IN TERMS

02:06:20.072 --> 02:06:21.273
OF TRYING TO ADDRESS THE STIGMA

02:06:21.340 --> 02:06:22.942

02:06:23.008 --> 02:06:25.144
IS CORRECT OKAY. AND THEN AND

02:06:25.210 --> 02:06:26.211

ABOUT WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT BUT

02:06:33.452 --> 02:06:36.722
ALSO BE SURE WE- TAYLOR

02:06:36.789 --> 02:06:38.891
EXPECTATIONS IN A WAY THAT WE

02:06:38.958 --> 02:06:42.194
DON'T SEE- SET EXPECTATIONS

02:06:42.261 --> 02:06:43.662
WHERE PEOPLE BECOME

02:06:43.729 --> 02:06:45.331
DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE IT'S GONNA

02:06:45.397 --> 02:06:46.665
BE REALLY HARD TO GET PEOPLE TO

02:06:46.732 --> 02:06:48.701
COME BACK IF THEY FEEL

02:06:48.767 --> 02:06:49.168
DISAPPOINTED UP IN THE

02:06:49.234 --> 02:06:51.003
BEGINNING SO I'M NOT. WE WANT

02:06:51.070 --> 02:06:51.804
TO LET PEOPLE KNOW WHAT WE'RE

02:06:51.870 --> 02:06:53.439
DOING WE WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW

02:06:53.505 --> 02:06:55.074
THAT THERE'S HELP WE NEED TO BE

02:06:55.140 --> 02:06:57.810
SURE WE CAN MEET THAT NEED AND-

02:06:57.876 --> 02:06:59.611
WHEN WAS WE AS AS WE'RE DOING

02:06:59.678 --> 02:07:01.213
THIS BUT WE NEED TO DO IT IN A

02:07:01.280 --> 02:07:03.716
WAY SOTHAT- WE DON'T HAVE

02:07:03.782 --> 02:07:06.518
PEOPLE. ARE GETTING FRUSTRATED

02:07:06.585 --> 02:07:07.987
AND THEN WALKING AWAY AND THEN

02:07:08.053 --> 02:07:09.121
WE WONDER WHY DON'T SHOW UP

02:07:09.188 --> 02:07:10.823
LATER WHEN WE ARE READY- SO WE

02:07:10.889 --> 02:07:12.024
HAVE THAT THAT'S GONNA BE

02:07:12.091 --> 02:07:14.460
CAREFUL PART OF THAT THE- THE

02:07:14.526 --> 02:07:15.728
MANAGEMENT EXPECTATIONS AS

02:07:15.794 --> 02:07:17.329
WELL. TO BE SURE THAT WE

02:07:17.396 --> 02:07:18.764
CONTINUE TO ENGAGE COMMUNITIES

02:07:18.831 --> 02:07:19.999
AND INDIVIDUALS WHO NEED HELP

02:07:20.065 --> 02:07:21.166
AND KNOW THAT THEY CAN GET

02:07:21.233 --> 02:07:24.036
HELP. BUT AT THE LEVEL WHICH

02:07:24.103 --> 02:07:25.270

PUTTING PEOPLE ON HOLD AS WELL

02:07:42.688 --> 02:07:43.455
