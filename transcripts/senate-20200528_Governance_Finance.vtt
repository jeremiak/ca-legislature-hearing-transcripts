00:15:53.319 --> 00:15:54.086
GOING TO DO PRODUCTION THIS

00:15:54.153 --> 00:15:56.055
YEAR. AND HONESTLY WHEN THE

00:15:56.121 --> 00:15:58.590
PANDEMIC HIT- A LOT OF PEOPLE

00:15:58.657 --> 00:15:59.625
SAID TO ME IT'S NEVER GOING TO

00:15:59.692 --> 00:16:01.393
HAPPEN NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN-

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:03.028
YOU KNOW WE NEED THE- PEOPLE

00:16:03.095 --> 00:16:04.863
ORGAN ONLY FOCUS. ON THE

00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:06.732
PANDEMIC. I TOLD THEM I DON'T

00:16:06.799 --> 00:16:08.167
THINK THAT WAS THE CASE-

00:16:08.233 --> 00:16:10.235
BECAUSE WE CAN WALK AND CHEW

00:16:10.302 --> 00:16:11.470
GUM AT THE SAME TIME AND WHAT

00:16:11.537 --> 00:16:12.271
WE'RE DOING WITH THIS TERRIBLE

00:16:12.338 --> 00:16:13.539
HEALTH EMERGENCY AND ECONOMIC

00:16:13.605 --> 00:16:16.342
EMERGENCY. WE DO HAVE TO FOCUS

00:16:16.408 --> 00:16:17.976
ON SOME OF THE COREISSUES THAT

00:16:18.043 --> 00:16:19.078
ARE THREATENING THE FUTURE OF

00:16:19.144 --> 00:16:22.081
OUR STATE BECAUSE- THE PANDEMIC

00:16:22.147 --> 00:16:23.182
IS GOING TO AND THE QUESTION IS

00:16:23.248 --> 00:16:24.717
ARE WE GOING TO THEN BE EVEN

00:16:24.783 --> 00:16:27.753
FURTHER BEHIND. ON HOUSING- AND

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:29.955
SO. THIS IS A- AND THIS IN

00:16:30.022 --> 00:16:31.990
PARTICULAR THIS BILL. IS A

00:16:32.057 --> 00:16:33.625
REALLY SMART APPROACH BECAUSE

00:16:33.692 --> 00:16:35.527
WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE GOING TO

00:16:35.594 --> 00:16:37.129
BE ECONOMIC IMPACTS ON THE

00:16:37.196 --> 00:16:39.531
CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY- AND YOU

00:16:39.598 --> 00:16:41.467
KNOW HIGH I HOPE THEIR MINIMIZE%

00:16:41.533 --> 00:16:42.835
BUT- FROM THE LARGE SCALE

00:16:42.901 --> 00:16:44.069
CONSTRUCTION. IN PARTICULAR AND

00:16:44.136 --> 00:16:45.537
FINANCING THERE COULD BE SOME

00:16:45.604 --> 00:16:48.207
DELAYS- BUT I MEAN WHEN YOU'RE

00:16:48.273 --> 00:16:50.309
TALKING ABOUT THIS LATER TOUCHY

00:16:50.376 --> 00:16:53.178
SMALLER PROJECTS. THE DUPLEX IN

00:16:53.245 --> 00:16:55.314
HERE BECAUSE OF A LOT SPLIT ITS

00:16:55.381 --> 00:16:57.216
TWO DUPLEXES POTENTIALLY ON A-

00:16:57.282 --> 00:16:59.084
LOT THAT IS LARGE ENOUGH. THESE

00:16:59.151 --> 00:17:01.220
ARE MUCH LOWER COST WAYS OF

00:17:01.286 --> 00:17:02.921
ADDING HOUSING. THIS IS HOUSING

00:17:02.988 --> 00:17:04.757
THAT CAN BE ADDED EVEN DURING

00:17:04.823 --> 00:17:06.925
AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. IT IS

00:17:06.992 --> 00:17:08.660
LATER TOUCH. IN TERMS OF

00:17:08.727 --> 00:17:10.696
CHANGES PHYSICALLY. IN A

00:17:10.763 --> 00:17:12.131
COMMUNITY I THINK IT STRIKES A

00:17:12.197 --> 00:17:15.300
REALLY STRONG BALANCE- THE-

00:17:15.367 --> 00:17:17.836
SOME OF THE PROVISIONS- IN IN

00:17:17.903 --> 00:17:20.339
THE BILL AROUND DEMOLITION

00:17:20.406 --> 00:17:22.307
OTHERWISE I THINK ALSO STRIKE.

00:17:22.374 --> 00:17:23.709
A REALLY STRONG BALANCE OF THIS

00:17:23.776 --> 00:17:26.578
IS A REALLY. SOLID SOLID BILL

00:17:26.645 --> 00:17:29.681
THAT OVER TIME. WILL RESULT IN

00:17:29.748 --> 00:17:31.250
A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF NEW

00:17:31.316 --> 00:17:33.552
HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA. A VERY

00:17:33.619 --> 00:17:36.088
HUMAN SCALE- THE DOESN'T YOU

00:17:37.556 --> 00:17:39.024

00:17:39.091 --> 00:17:40.826
SOME OF US TO- THING TYPE CAN

00:17:40.893 --> 00:17:42.661
BE A GOOD THING- YOU KNOW WE

00:17:42.728 --> 00:17:44.396
WANT TO. STRIKE A BALANCE AND

00:17:44.463 --> 00:17:45.798
EVEN IN SB FIFTY WE OFTEN

00:17:45.864 --> 00:17:47.433
DEFERRED. TO LOCAL HEIGHT

00:17:47.499 --> 00:17:48.700
LIMITS IN THIS BILL DOES THAT

00:17:48.767 --> 00:17:50.702

00:36:34.725 --> 00:36:36.294
CORPORATE INCOME TAX ONLY

00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:40.364
REFLECTS. 9% OF OUR TOTAL

00:36:40.431 --> 00:36:42.466
GENERAL FUND REVENUES IN THE

00:36:42.533 --> 00:36:47.471
PAST IT WAS UP 217% AND SO THIS

00:36:47.538 --> 00:36:49.640
IS AT A TIME WHEN CLARA

00:36:49.707 --> 00:36:52.076
CALIFORNIA IS CRITICIZED FOR

00:36:52.143 --> 00:36:53.945
HER FOR HAVING VERY VOLATILE%

00:36:54.011 --> 00:36:56.514
CELL STATE REVENUES AND BEING

00:36:56.581 --> 00:36:58.616
RELIANCE PRIMARILY ON

00:36:58.683 --> 00:37:01.118
INDIVIDUAL INCOME TAX AND YET

00:37:01.185 --> 00:37:03.955
OUR REVENUE IN TOTAL FROM

00:37:04.021 --> 00:37:06.023
CORPORATE TAXES IS A VERY LOW

00:37:06.090 --> 00:37:08.159
PERCENT OF OUR GENERAL FUND.

00:37:08.225 --> 00:37:10.094
AND WE CAN'T EVEN ANALYZE

00:37:10.161 --> 00:37:12.163
WHETHER THOSE CORPORATIONS

00:37:12.229 --> 00:37:14.732
WHICH TODAY ARE. FIVE MAYBE NOT

00:37:14.799 --> 00:37:16.801
EXACTLY TODAY BUT IN GENERAL

00:37:16.867 --> 00:37:19.270
RECORDING RECORD PROFITS WHAT

00:37:19.337 --> 00:37:22.440
THEY ARE PROVIDING TO US AND SO

00:37:22.506 --> 00:37:24.642
WHEN WE DEBATE TAX POLCY. WE

00:37:24.709 --> 00:37:26.811
HAVE VERY LITTLE INFORMATION TO

00:37:26.877 --> 00:37:28.713
REALLY INFORM ANY TYPES OF

00:37:28.779 --> 00:37:32.183
DECISIONS NOW OPTIMALLY I THINK

00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:35.186
SUCH A DATABASE THAT SB NINE

00:37:35.252 --> 00:37:36.621
SEVEN TWO IS ESTABLISHING

00:37:36.687 --> 00:37:39.690
SHOULD INCLUDE. THE DATA ON THE

00:37:39.757 --> 00:37:41.525
INDIVIDUAL TAX BREAKS IN OTHER

00:37:41.592 --> 00:37:43.928
WORDS DOESCORPORATE TAX TAKE

00:37:43.995 --> 00:37:45.863
WATERS IT DOES IT TAKE YOU KNOW

00:37:45.930 --> 00:37:47.465
WHAT THE WHOLE VARIETY OF THEM

00:37:47.531 --> 00:37:49.133
AND WE HAVE MANY MANY MANY MANY

00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:51.602
MANY. BUT NO THIS IS A VERY

00:37:51.669 --> 00:37:55.940
SIMPLE DATABASE IT IS PURELY

00:37:56.007 --> 00:37:57.408
THOSE CORPORATIONS WITH GROCERY

00:37:57.475 --> 00:38:00.511
BEATS FIVE BILLION OR MORE. WHO

00:38:00.578 --> 00:38:03.414
WOULD INFORM US OF THE TOTAL

00:38:03.481 --> 00:38:05.316
AMOUNT OF STATE TAXES PAID AND

00:38:05.383 --> 00:38:07.918
THE TOTAL AMOUNT THE VALUE OF

00:38:07.985 --> 00:38:10.655
STATE TAX CREDITS. EVENTUALLY

00:38:10.721 --> 00:38:13.190
WE SHOULD HAVE MORE DATA BUT

00:38:13.257 --> 00:38:17.028
GIVEN. THE TYPE OF. GIVEN TAT

00:38:17.094 --> 00:38:20.498
WE ARE OUR REVENUES ARE DOWN WE

00:38:20.564 --> 00:38:22.199
DO NOT WANT TO ADD A LOT OF

00:38:22.266 --> 00:38:24.602
COST TO OUR DEPARTMENTS IN

00:38:24.669 --> 00:38:26.671
TRYING TO GATHER SUCH DATA OR

00:38:26.737 --> 00:38:29.807
SYMBOL SUCH A DATABASE. SO I

00:38:29.874 --> 00:38:31.809
WENT WITH THE SIMPLEST.

00:38:31.876 --> 00:38:35.346
INITIALLY NOW JUST AS CONTRAST

00:38:35.413 --> 00:38:36.414

WOULD CAUTION THE COMMITTEE

00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:50.827
THAT THIS VERY WELL COULD

00:48:50.894 --> 00:48:53.397
VIOLATE HIS PROVISION OF

00:49:25.962 --> 00:49:27.831
AGGREGATE BASIS THAT- THE

00:49:27.898 --> 00:49:29.666
COMMITTEE DEFINITELY COULD WORK

00:49:29.733 --> 00:49:31.435

DECISIONS I'M THE ONLY OTHER

00:49:47.217 --> 00:49:48.952
REASON THAT WE CAN THINK THAT

00:49:49.019 --> 00:49:51.455
THE AGGREGATE INFORMATION ISN'T

00:49:51.521 --> 00:49:53.323
SUFFICIENT FOR POLICY MAKERS

00:49:53.390 --> 00:49:55.692
AND WE BY NO MEANS BELIEVE THAT

00:49:55.759 --> 00:49:57.694
THERE IS- ANY TRUTH TO THAT. IS

00:49:57.761 --> 00:49:59.196
THAT THERE'S SOMETHING THE

00:49:59.262 --> 00:50:00.897
COMMITTEE ISN'T TALKING ABOUT

00:50:00.964 --> 00:50:02.532

MEANS SAYING THAT THAT IS THE

00:50:08.572 --> 00:50:10.173
CASE- BUT THAT WOULD BE THE

00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:12.075
ONLY REASON THAT YOU WOULD NEED

00:50:12.142 --> 00:50:17.414
TO ATTACK TAX. INFORMATION AS

00:50:17.481 --> 00:50:18.782

WITNESS HAD. MADE A POINT OF

WHY ARE WE CONSIDERING THIS NOW

00:54:19.990 --> 00:54:21.891
DURING THE PANDEMIC AND THIS

00:54:21.958 --> 00:54:23.360
DOESN'T SEEM TO RISE TO THE

00:54:23.426 --> 00:54:25.061
LEVEL I ACTUALLY THINK. IT DOES

00:54:25.128 --> 00:54:26.429
AND I THINK IT ACTUALLY IS

00:54:26.496 --> 00:54:29.633
TIED. TO OR EXPERIENCE NOW WHAT

00:54:29.699 --> 00:54:31.835
COVE IN NINETEEN. HAS DONE IN

00:54:31.901 --> 00:54:34.371
MANY WAYS IT'S CAST A SPOTLIGHT

00:54:34.437 --> 00:54:37.240
VERY BRIGHT SPOTLIGHT ON SOME

00:54:37.307 --> 00:54:40.076
OF THE REAL- INEQUITIES AND

00:54:40.143 --> 00:54:42.112
PROBLEMS AND DEFICIENCIES. IN

00:54:42.178 --> 00:54:45.782
OUR SOCIETY AND OUR APPROACH TO

00:54:45.849 --> 00:54:48.051
GOVERNANCE. NOT EVERYONE HAD

00:54:48.118 --> 00:54:50.587
REALLY FOCUSED ON BEFORE A

00:54:50.654 --> 00:54:53.423
NUMBER OF US DID. NOT EVERYONE-

00:54:53.490 --> 00:54:56.626
AND ONE OF THOSE DEFICIENCIES.

00:54:56.693 --> 00:54:59.095
IS THE COME THE COMPLETE

00:54:59.162 --> 00:55:00.930
INADEQUACY OF OUR SOCIAL SAFETY

00:55:00.997 --> 00:55:04.134
NET. IN CALIFORNIA AND

00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:05.268
NATIONALLY IN A LOT OF PEOPLE

00:55:05.335 --> 00:55:08.004
ARE EXPERIENCING THAT LACK OF A

00:55:08.071 --> 00:55:08.838
SAFETY NET NOW FOR THE FIRST

00:55:08.905 --> 00:55:10.607
TIME. BECAUSE A MORE SECURE

00:55:10.674 --> 00:55:12.308
BEFORE THEY'RE NOT NOW AND THEN

00:55:12.375 --> 00:55:15.311
REALIZING ALL MY GOD- THERE'S-

00:55:15.378 --> 00:55:16.579
A LIKE WHAT DOES NOTHING TO

00:55:16.646 --> 00:55:18.314
PREVENT. OR NOT ENOUGH TO

00:55:18.381 --> 00:55:19.949
PREVENT PEOPLE FROM FREE

00:55:20.016 --> 00:55:22.986
FALLING. AT ONE OF THE REASONS.

00:55:23.053 --> 00:55:23.987
UP FOR THE LACK OF AN ADEQUATE

00:55:24.054 --> 00:55:26.756
SAFETY NET IS BECAUSE WE HAVE

00:55:26.823 --> 00:55:28.625
AN INADEQUATE TAX SYSTEM THAT

00:55:28.692 --> 00:55:32.228
DOESN'T ARTICLE ADEQUATELY TAX.

00:55:32.295 --> 00:55:34.164
RICH CORPORATIONS BUT DOESN'T

00:55:34.230 --> 00:55:37.500
ADEQUATELY TAX WEALTH. AND WHEN

00:55:37.567 --> 00:55:39.202
WE LOOK AT CORPORATE TAXATION

00:55:39.269 --> 00:55:41.705
WE KNOW. BECAUSE SOMETIMES

00:55:41.771 --> 00:55:43.807
INFORMATION GETS OUT THAT SOME

00:55:43.873 --> 00:55:45.608
OF THE LARGEST CORPORATIONS IN

00:55:45.675 --> 00:55:49.846
THE WORLD. PAY LITTLE OR NO.

00:55:49.913 --> 00:55:52.482
FIVE CORPORATE INCOME TAX. HI

00:55:52.549 --> 00:55:53.349
BUT WE DON'T HAVE THE

00:55:53.416 --> 00:55:55.218
SYSTEMATIC DATA WHICH I THINK

00:55:55.285 --> 00:55:56.953
IT WILL SHOW SOME VERY VERY

00:55:57.020 --> 00:55:59.422
INTERESTING RESULTS AND MAY

00:55:59.489 --> 00:56:02.225
ACTUALLY BE INSTRUCTIVE AND

00:56:02.292 --> 00:56:04.227
HELPFUL IN TRYING TO HAVE A

00:56:04.294 --> 00:56:06.362
MORE EQUITABLE SYSTEM OF

00:56:06.429 --> 00:56:09.566
TAXATION OF FOR CORPORATIONS

00:56:09.632 --> 00:56:11.301
FOR THE THOUGHT ACCEPTABLE.

00:56:11.367 --> 00:56:13.136
WHEN YOU KNOW CORPORATION LIKE

00:56:13.203 --> 00:56:14.404
IT'S AN AMAZON OR SOMETHING

00:56:14.471 --> 00:56:17.974
ELSE IS PAYING SUCH A LITTLE.

00:56:18.041 --> 00:56:22.245
IN INCOME TAX. SO WE LOOK AT IT

00:56:22.312 --> 00:56:23.980
RESPONDING TO COVER NINETEEN.

00:56:24.047 --> 00:56:25.448
WE NEED TO LOOK AT OUR TAX

00:56:25.515 --> 00:56:26.649
SYSTEM WE NEED TO LOOK AT

00:56:26.716 --> 00:56:30.120
TAXATION. AND THIS VERY BASIC

00:56:30.186 --> 00:56:32.021
DATA IS NOT A VIOLATION OF

00:56:32.088 --> 00:56:34.991
PRIVACY THIS IS ABOUT. HOW MUCH

00:56:35.058 --> 00:56:36.493
TAX YOU PAYING AND HOW MAY TAX

00:56:36.559 --> 00:56:38.294

BEING MADE. I THINK A WRONG.

00:57:06.189 --> 00:57:08.758
THE REALITY IS THAT THERE ARE

00:57:08.825 --> 00:57:11.261

00:57:11.327 --> 00:57:13.630

00:58:31.407 --> 00:58:33.076
IS NOT THE REASON. AND YOU

00:58:33.142 --> 00:58:35.445
DON'T GET TO IT. WE COMBINE I

00:58:35.511 --> 00:58:36.546
GET THE ISSUE OF THE SHAMING

00:58:36.613 --> 00:58:37.714
PART I THINK IT'S AN

00:58:37.780 --> 00:58:39.716
INTERESTING OBSERVATION. BUT

00:58:39.782 --> 00:58:42.018
THE REALITY IS WE ARE TRYING TO

00:58:42.085 --> 00:58:44.053
RUN A GOVERNMENT THAT. CREATES

00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:45.755
THE RIGHT INCENTIVES TO CHOOSE

00:58:45.822 --> 00:58:47.757
THE RIGHT OUTCOMES. AND IF

00:58:47.824 --> 00:58:49.692
THEY'RE NOT TO CORRECT IT. AND

00:58:49.759 --> 00:58:52.929
SO WHY SUPPORT THIS BILL IS

00:58:52.996 --> 00:58:53.796
BECAUSE I THINK IT'S GOOD

00:58:53.863 --> 00:58:56.132
MANAGEMENT. I THINK THAT THE

00:58:56.199 --> 00:58:57.166
ARGUMENTS THAT ARE BEING MADE

00:58:57.233 --> 00:58:59.168
AGAINST IT. ARE THE SAME KIND

00:58:59.235 --> 00:59:00.169
OF ARGUMENTS ARE BEING MADE

00:59:00.236 --> 00:59:01.371
AGAINST SOME OF THE OTHER BILLS

00:59:01.437 --> 00:59:02.739
THAT IT'S BASICALLY ABOUT WILL

00:59:02.805 --> 00:59:04.073
WE DON'T WANT TO DO THIS AND WE

00:59:04.140 --> 00:59:06.009
WANT TO GET WE WANT TO GET. AND

00:59:06.075 --> 00:59:07.010
WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY IN

00:59:07.076 --> 00:59:07.844
GOVERNMENT TO ASK THE TOUGH

00:59:07.911 --> 00:59:10.213
QUESTIONS. AND IT SEEMS TO ME

00:59:10.280 --> 00:59:11.114
THAT ANY COMPANY THAT WOULD

00:59:11.180 --> 00:59:13.683
HAVE. A BUNCH OF TAX CREDITS

00:59:13.750 --> 00:59:15.051
SECOND ISSUE STATEMENTS VACANCY

00:59:15.118 --> 00:59:16.085
YOU CAN JUSTIFY WHAT THEY'RE

00:59:16.152 --> 00:59:17.587
DOING THEY'LL COME BEFORE

00:59:17.654 --> 00:59:19.589
HERE'S WITH AN EXAM UP ISSUES.

00:59:19.656 --> 00:59:21.190
TERM WHETHER WILL WRITE WHAT

00:59:21.257 --> 00:59:23.092
THE WILL WRONG. BUT WHAT WE'RE

00:59:23.159 --> 00:59:26.796
ENGAGE IN THIS BIG DEBTS. AND

00:59:26.863 --> 00:59:27.897
YOU KNOW THAT'S NO SURPRISE SEE

00:59:27.964 --> 00:59:29.732
OF WHICH- SPENT A GREAT DEAL OF

00:59:29.799 --> 00:59:32.068
TIME. EITHER IN THE BENEFIT OF

00:59:32.135 --> 00:59:34.003
FISH. THIS POLICY WERE

00:59:34.070 --> 00:59:35.738
GOVERNMENT SAYS WE'RE GONNA

00:59:35.805 --> 00:59:38.541
GIVE YOU THIS THIS BENEFIT AND

00:59:38.608 --> 00:59:39.642
YOU SHOULD HAVE AN OBLIGATION

00:59:39.709 --> 00:59:41.878
TO JUSTIFY TAKING THAT BENEFIT.

00:59:41.945 --> 00:59:47.650
SO I AM LISTENED CLOSELY TO THE

00:59:47.717 --> 00:59:48.384
ARGUMENTS IN OPPOSITION. AND I

00:59:48.451 --> 00:59:49.252
JUST THINK THE- I THINK THEY

00:59:49.319 --> 00:59:52.088
COMPORT TO BASIC. PRINCIPLES I

00:59:52.155 --> 00:59:53.289
DON'T THINK THAT THEY SHOULD BE

00:59:53.356 --> 00:59:54.324
VIEWED IN THE ISSUE OF LABOR

00:59:54.390 --> 00:59:56.492
VERSUS MANAGEMENT. THIS IS OUR

00:59:56.559 --> 00:59:59.095
JOB AS PUBLIC OFFICIALS. THAT

00:59:59.162 --> 01:00:01.698
PROPERLY- A STEWARDS OF

01:00:01.764 --> 01:00:03.299
TAXPAYER DOLLARS. AND TO

01:00:03.366 --> 01:00:04.767
BASICALLY MAKE SURE WE HAVE

01:00:04.834 --> 01:00:06.736
PERFORMANCE MEASURES TO ENSURE

01:00:06.803 --> 01:00:08.738
THE POLICIES THAT WE ENGAGE IN.

01:00:08.805 --> 01:00:10.473
ARE CHEATING THE OUTCOMES THAT

01:00:10.540 --> 01:00:12.342
THEY'RE ACHIEVING AND THIS WILL

01:00:12.408 --> 01:00:13.276
ALLOW US TO ENGAGE A SPECIFIC

01:00:13.343 --> 01:00:15.278
CONVERSATIONS. TO GET TO THAT

01:00:15.345 --> 01:00:17.113
GOAL SO I THINK IT'S VERY

01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:18.548
THOUGHTFUL. A AND I DON'T THINK

01:00:18.614 --> 01:00:20.049
THE CHARACTERS A AS TO HOW IT'S

01:00:20.116 --> 01:00:22.185
BEEN LAID OUT IS ACCURATE. AND

01:00:22.251 --> 01:00:23.319
I THINK IT'S GOOD MANAGEMENT

01:00:23.386 --> 01:00:24.654
THE RIGHT THING TO DO AND

01:00:24.721 --> 01:00:25.655
THAT'S ONE WITH A VOTE FOR THIS

01:00:25.722 --> 01:00:27.223
BILL TODAY. THANK YOU SO MUCH

PICK UP OR SENATOR HERTZBERG

01:00:35.298 --> 01:00:38.468
LEFT OFF I. I THINK HE MAKES

01:00:38.534 --> 01:00:39.969
SOME VERY STRONG. POINTS BUT I

01:00:40.036 --> 01:00:41.704
DON'T THINK THE ISSUE IS THAT

01:00:41.771 --> 01:00:47.310
WE DON'T TAX ENOUGH. WHAT'S

01:00:47.377 --> 01:00:49.479
WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THIS BODY

01:00:49.545 --> 01:00:51.581
KEEPS APPROVING TAX CREDITS.

01:00:51.647 --> 01:00:53.816
AND IT DOESN'T ANALYZE. WHAT

01:00:53.883 --> 01:00:58.154
THEY DO. BUT IT'S AN INDICTMENT

01:00:58.221 --> 01:00:59.255
IT'S AN INDICTMENT OF THE

01:00:59.322 --> 01:01:01.057
FRANCHISE TAX BOARD IT'S AN

01:01:01.124 --> 01:01:02.291
INDICTMENT OF THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:01:02.358 --> 01:01:04.394
FINANCE THAT WE DON'T EVEN KNOW

01:01:04.460 --> 01:01:04.994
WHAT OUR REVENUES ARE AND WHAT

01:01:05.061 --> 01:01:09.399
ARE. TAX EXPENDITURES ARE. AND

01:01:09.465 --> 01:01:12.035
SO NOW WE'RE SAMPLING. WITH A

01:01:12.101 --> 01:01:14.570
GROUP OF CORPORATE CITIZENS

01:01:14.637 --> 01:01:16.639
THAT EARN A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF

01:01:16.706 --> 01:01:20.176
TOTAL REVENUES AND I THINK IT'S

01:01:20.243 --> 01:01:21.944
BAD MANAGEMENT I AGREE WITH THE

01:01:22.011 --> 01:01:25.114

GET IT AN ACTOR AGGREGATE

01:04:01.938 --> 01:04:05.174
HOWEVER THAT DOES NOT ASSIST US

01:04:05.241 --> 01:04:09.212
IN THE DAY. DO NOT IT IS VERY

01:04:09.278 --> 01:04:11.581

BECAUSE ANY TAX CREDIT IS A TAX

01:04:21.824 --> 01:04:23.359
EXPENDITURE RIGHT WE KNOW

LIST BUT EACH INDIVIDUAL TAX

01:04:36.272 --> 01:04:38.007
CREDIT WE HAVE MUCH LESS VERY

01:04:38.074 --> 01:04:39.909
SPECIFIC BECAUSE WE DON'T ALLOW

01:04:39.976 --> 01:04:42.945
IT PUBLICLY. NOW THIS BILL DOES

01:04:43.012 --> 01:04:45.748

TO FIVE HUNDRED COMPANIES AND

01:05:03.633 --> 01:05:05.234
THESE COMPANIES DO NOT HAVE TO

01:05:05.301 --> 01:05:06.936
BE CALIFORNIA HEADQUARTERS.

01:05:07.003 --> 01:05:10.106
THERE ACROSS THE US SO I FOUND

01:05:10.172 --> 01:05:11.540
IT VERY INTERESTING TO HEAR THE

01:05:11.607 --> 01:05:12.675
OPPOSITION TALK ABOUT

01:05:12.742 --> 01:05:14.477

PURPOSE IS NOT TO SHAME BUT

01:05:32.828 --> 01:05:34.130
THAT YOU DIDN'T ASK THAT SO

01:05:34.196 --> 01:05:36.866

I CAN'T. THAT AGGREGATE DATA

01:05:39.669 --> 01:05:41.304
WHICH IS WHY WE KNOW FOR

01:05:41.370 --> 01:05:43.806
EXAMPLE. THAT CORPORATE INCOME

01:05:43.873 --> 01:05:46.509
TAX REVENUE TO THE STATE IS

DON'T HAVE ANY INDIVIDUAL DATA.

01:05:57.353 --> 01:05:59.055
BECAUSE WE BECAUSE OUR LAW

01:05:59.121 --> 01:06:01.290
PREVENTS IT HOWEVER ALL THE

01:06:01.357 --> 01:06:03.426
OTHER STATES THAT I MENTIONED

01:06:03.492 --> 01:06:06.128

RIGHTS WITH THIS. BILL NULLIFY

01:06:14.837 --> 01:06:17.340
THAT BILL IS NOT NOTIFY THE

01:06:17.406 --> 01:06:19.608
ENTIRE LOT BY ANY MEANS IT

01:06:19.675 --> 01:06:23.412
PURELY ENABLES THE F. T. B. TO

01:06:23.479 --> 01:06:27.049
PROVIDE US WITH THE TWO DATA

01:06:27.116 --> 01:06:30.653
POINTS THAT WAS REITERATED BY.

01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:34.690
ONE OF THE- ARE- SEIU

01:06:34.757 --> 01:06:37.326
REPRESENTATIVE A PURELY GIVES

01:06:37.393 --> 01:06:39.261
US INFORMATION ON TWO DATA

01:06:39.328 --> 01:06:42.398
POINTS FOR THOSE FOUR HUNDRED

01:06:42.465 --> 01:06:44.200
FIVE HUNDRED COMPANIES WITH

01:06:44.266 --> 01:06:44.800
GROSS RECEIPTS OF FIVE BILLION

01:06:44.867 --> 01:06:47.269
OR MORE. AND IT WAS STATED THAT

01:06:47.336 --> 01:06:49.438
IT VIOLATES INTERVIEW CODE

01:06:49.505 --> 01:06:53.242
SECTION SIXTY FIVE. TO SIXTY

01:06:53.309 --> 01:06:53.776
SIXTY ONE OH THREE IS THAT

01:06:53.843 --> 01:06:56.512
ACCURATE. THAT IS NOT MY

01:06:56.579 --> 01:06:58.047
UNDERSTANDING IT IS CERTAINLY

01:06:58.114 --> 01:07:00.850
WAS NOT SOMETHING THE ANALYSIS-

01:07:00.916 --> 01:07:04.286
IF IT WAS- THERE WAS A VERY

01:07:04.353 --> 01:07:07.690
THOROUGH ANALYSIS AND- THAT IS

01:07:07.757 --> 01:07:08.190
NOT AN ELEMENT THAT WAS

01:07:08.257 --> 01:07:11.727
INCLUDED. SERVICE CAN BY THE

01:07:11.794 --> 01:07:13.929
OPPOSITION I'M I'M JUST. I'M

01:07:13.996 --> 01:07:14.730
JUST HAVING DIFFICULTY WITH

01:07:14.797 --> 01:07:16.365
THIS AND THIS APPROACH AND IT

01:07:16.432 --> 01:07:17.700
JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT WE SHOULD

01:07:17.767 --> 01:07:19.935
HAVE THIS DATA ALTHOUGH YOU I

01:07:20.002 --> 01:07:21.070
BELIEVE IN PRIVACY SO I'M I'M

01:07:21.137 --> 01:07:22.471
HAVING A TOUGH TIME EVEN THOUGH

01:07:22.538 --> 01:07:23.672
YOU'RE ASKING FOR VERY SPARSE

01:07:23.739 --> 01:07:26.442
INFORMATION AYE- BUT IT SEEMS

01:07:26.509 --> 01:07:27.710
TO ME THAT THE FRANCHISE TAX

01:07:27.777 --> 01:07:29.445
FOR SHOULD BE HELPING US OUT.

01:07:29.512 --> 01:07:30.513
AND THERE SHOULD BE LIKE A

01:07:30.579 --> 01:07:32.681
REGULAR DRILL OF WHAT IS THIS

01:07:32.748 --> 01:07:34.183
CREDIT DOING WITH IT IS IT

01:07:34.250 --> 01:07:36.318
DOING WHAT IT WAS DESIGNED AND

01:07:36.385 --> 01:07:37.219
IT'S A LITTLE EMBARRASSING TO

01:07:37.286 --> 01:07:40.322
ME THAT WE HAVE TO DO A BILL TO

01:07:40.389 --> 01:07:41.857
TELL THEM TO YOU THAT'S WHY I

01:07:41.924 --> 01:07:43.426
APPLAUD YOU FOR DOING THAT I

01:07:43.492 --> 01:07:45.561
AGREE WITH. WE GOT A WE GOT A

01:07:45.628 --> 01:07:47.363
PROD SOMEONE TO START MANAGING

01:07:47.430 --> 01:07:50.900
WHAT WE'RE DOING- BECAUSE I

01:07:50.966 --> 01:07:51.967
THINK THE TAX SYSTEM. COULD

01:07:52.034 --> 01:07:55.237
HAVE A LOT OF CHANGES BUT- BUT

01:07:55.304 --> 01:07:56.205
TED TED TO NIBBLE AROUND THE

01:07:56.272 --> 01:08:00.109
EDGES- IN THIS WAY. I'M HAVING

01:08:00.176 --> 01:08:01.710
DIFFICULTY WITH IT SO I WILL BE

01:08:01.777 --> 01:08:04.013
OPPOSED. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR

ANSWER THAT AND WE'RE GOING TO

01:08:06.248 --> 01:08:09.051
SONORA THROUGH THE CHAIR. THE

01:08:09.118 --> 01:08:11.120
PROBLEM IS IT'S NOT SO MUCH ME

01:08:11.187 --> 01:08:14.824
WEEK. WHETHER F. T. B. HAS

01:08:14.890 --> 01:08:16.392
THOSE CAPABILITIES OR NOT OF

01:08:16.459 --> 01:08:17.960
COURSE WE'D HAVE TO TEST THE

01:08:18.027 --> 01:08:21.764
ISSUE IS. OUR OWN STATUTES FOR

01:08:21.831 --> 01:08:22.998
BID THEM FROM GIVING US THAT

01:08:23.065 --> 01:08:25.434
DATA SO IF YOU RECALL WHEN WE

01:08:25.501 --> 01:08:27.036
EXTENDED THE FILM TAX CREDIT

01:08:27.102 --> 01:08:29.271
NOW I BELIEVE THAT WAS IN A

01:08:29.338 --> 01:08:31.207
SEVENTEEN. YET WHEN WE EXTEND

01:08:31.273 --> 01:08:33.108
THE FILM TAX CREDIT. WE

01:08:33.175 --> 01:08:35.110
REQUIRED. THE EVERYONE WHO TOOK

01:08:35.177 --> 01:08:36.479
ADVANTAGE OF IT TO DISCLOSE

01:08:36.545 --> 01:08:38.180
CERTAIN AMOUNT OF INFORMATION

01:08:38.247 --> 01:08:41.283
HOW MANY JOBS TO CREATE A WHOLE

01:08:41.350 --> 01:08:43.819
VARIETY OF THINGS. BECAUSE IN

01:08:43.886 --> 01:08:45.688
THE BECAUSE OUR TAX LAW WOULD

01:08:45.754 --> 01:08:48.924
NOT. PROHIBIT US FROM GETTING

01:08:48.991 --> 01:08:52.261
THAT INFORMATION SO IN A WAY WE

01:08:52.328 --> 01:08:56.532
HAVE CREATED THE BARRIER. OKAY

01:08:56.599 --> 01:08:57.399
BECAUSE WE WANT TO GET THE

01:08:57.466 --> 01:08:58.968
CENTER TUNNEL PLEASE RAISE YOUR

01:08:59.034 --> 01:09:00.202
STRUCTURE AND- THIS YEAR'S

01:09:00.269 --> 01:09:04.306
REALLY DIFFICULT- BUT MAYBE WE

01:09:04.373 --> 01:09:06.175
OUGHT TO HAVE A HEARING. ON

01:09:06.242 --> 01:09:07.910

01:09:07.977 --> 01:09:09.845
ABOUT OUR TAX SYSTEM CORPORATE

01:09:09.912 --> 01:09:11.680
INDIVIDUAL AT A CERTAIN.

01:09:11.747 --> 01:09:13.649
REVIEWING WHAT WHAT IT IS WHAT

01:09:13.716 --> 01:09:16.919
IT HOW IT COMPARES TO OTHERS IN

01:09:16.986 --> 01:09:20.589
WHERE WE CAN IMPROVE IT. AT AND

01:09:20.656 --> 01:09:21.323
THAT'S JUST MY RECOMMENDATION

01:09:21.390 --> 01:09:22.825
STRUCTURE FOR SHE TEMAS VICE

01:09:22.892 --> 01:09:23.459
CHAIR I THINK IT IS ALSO

01:09:23.526 --> 01:09:24.560
IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT THERE IS

01:09:24.627 --> 01:09:26.061
A BILL BY SENATOR JACKSON THAT

01:09:26.128 --> 01:09:28.264
WAS ADVANCED. LAST WEEK THAT

<u>&lt;c.green&gt;REDITS SO I THINK THAT WAS&lt;/c&gt;</u>

01:09:43.479 --> 01:09:45.281
SAID THAT IT WAS RETURNED LAST

01:09:45.347 --> 01:09:46.882
YEAR- BUT AND THIS COMMITTEE

01:09:46.949 --> 01:09:48.617
DID PASS IT WITH MAJORITY VOTE.

01:09:48.684 --> 01:09:50.185
ON THAT ISSUE TO BE TO DO THE

01:09:50.252 --> 01:09:51.954

PREPARED TO SUPPORT THE BILL

01:10:02.665 --> 01:10:04.166
TODAY I HAVE REAL CONCERNS

01:10:04.233 --> 01:10:06.201
REGARDING- PUBLICLY DISCLOSING

01:10:06.268 --> 01:10:08.237
THAT INFORMATION BUT- I THINK

01:10:08.304 --> 01:10:09.672
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IS. IS

01:10:09.738 --> 01:10:11.140
THE RIGHT THING AND I THINK IT.

01:10:11.206 --> 01:10:12.942
WOULD NEED TO BE WORKING ON

01:10:13.008 --> 01:10:15.110
THAT AND- I GUESS MY QUESTION

01:10:15.177 --> 01:10:18.447
IS- WHY NOT GIVE F. T. BEAT THE

01:10:18.514 --> 01:10:20.549
ABILITY TO. TO FURTHER INSPECT

01:10:20.616 --> 01:10:22.318
THAT THE ADDITIONAL CRITERIA

01:10:22.384 --> 01:10:24.820
THAT YOU'RE SEEKING TO. GET OLD

01:10:24.887 --> 01:10:26.322
TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION SO THAT

01:10:26.388 --> 01:10:27.156
THEY COULD MAKE THAT

01:10:27.222 --> 01:10:29.258
DETERMINATION OF WHETHER OR NOT

01:10:29.325 --> 01:10:30.726
THE FACT THAT THAT THAT. THAT

01:10:30.793 --> 01:10:32.494
TAX CREDIT ELIGIBILITY AND I

01:10:32.561 --> 01:10:34.396
THINK THAT. MIGHT MAKE IT MORE

01:10:34.463 --> 01:10:35.831
IMMEDIATE DIFFERENCE IN TERMS

01:10:35.898 --> 01:10:38.233

SEVEN TWO DOES NOT RAISE TAXES

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:02.104
IT DOES NOT ELIMINATE ANY TAXES

01:14:02.171 --> 01:14:03.739
AND IT COVERS. CORPORATIONS

01:14:03.806 --> 01:14:07.376
THAT. DO BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA

01:14:07.442 --> 01:14:08.544
BUT THEY'RE NOT HEADQUARTERED

01:14:08.610 --> 01:14:09.645
THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE

01:14:09.711 --> 01:14:11.113
HEADQUARTERED HERE SO IT'S NOT

01:14:11.180 --> 01:14:12.915
JUST GOING AFTER CALIFORNIA

01:14:12.981 --> 01:14:15.918
CORPORATIONS IT IS PURELY

01:14:15.984 --> 01:14:18.053
GIVING US AS POLICY MAKERS AND

01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:20.155
THE PUBLIC SOME INFORMATION

01:14:20.222 --> 01:14:23.325
THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO

01:14:23.392 --> 01:14:27.296
APPROPRIATELY EVALUATE OUR

01:14:27.362 --> 01:14:29.631
EXPENDITURES. AND HAVE AN

01:14:29.698 --> 01:14:32.901
INFORMED DEBATE AROUND WHEN WE

01:14:32.968 --> 01:14:34.870
ARE MAKING EXPENDITURE CUTS NOW

01:14:34.937 --> 01:14:36.738
THIS IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT

01:14:36.805 --> 01:14:39.174
DURING A DOWNTURN AS WE ARE NOW

01:14:39.241 --> 01:14:41.210
DISCO BUT NINETEEN INDUCED

01:14:41.276 --> 01:14:44.546
ECONOMIC DOWNTURN WHERE IN THE

01:14:44.613 --> 01:14:46.348
BUDGET THE GOVERNOR'S PRESENTED

01:14:46.415 --> 01:14:47.583
TO US THAT'S A FIFTY FOUR

01:14:47.649 --> 01:14:51.320
BILLION DOLLARS OF CUTS. AND

01:14:51.386 --> 01:14:54.523
WHILE I AM NOT POSING RIGHT NOW

01:14:54.590 --> 01:14:56.625
AT ALL ANY REDUCTION OR

01:14:56.692 --> 01:14:59.361
ELIMINATION OF TAX CREDITS IT

01:14:59.428 --> 01:15:03.065
IS VERY DIFFICULT TO EVALUATE.

01:15:03.131 --> 01:15:05.200
OTHER EXPENDITURE CUTS THAT ARE

01:15:05.267 --> 01:15:07.169
IN THAT BUDGET WITHOUT HAVING

01:15:07.236 --> 01:15:09.004
FULL ACCESS TO DATA ON ALL OF

01:15:09.071 --> 01:15:10.606
OUR DIFFERENT EXPENDITURES AND

01:15:10.672 --> 01:15:12.774
OF COURSE TAX CREDITS ARE A BIG

01:15:12.841 --> 01:15:16.044
EXPENDITURE NOW THE TOTAL VALUE

01:15:16.111 --> 01:15:17.746
OF TAX CREDITS WITHIN THE STATE

01:15:17.813 --> 01:15:19.481
OF CALIFORNIA FOR EVERY HE IS

01:15:19.548 --> 01:15:20.616
LIKE IN THE SEVENTY BILLION%

01:15:20.682 --> 01:15:23.285
ORDER. SO IN A WAY WE SHOULD BE

01:15:23.352 --> 01:15:25.420
DOING A DATABASE THAT COVERS

01:15:25.487 --> 01:15:26.588
ALL OF THEM BUT THAT WOULD BE

01:15:26.655 --> 01:15:29.291
QUITE EXPENSIVE IN QUITE SO I'M

01:15:29.358 --> 01:15:31.760
TRYING TO START MODESTLY. AND I

01:15:31.827 --> 01:15:32.728
FOUND THE DEBATE WITH

01:15:32.794 --> 01:15:34.730
OPPOSITION IN A AND THE

01:15:34.796 --> 01:15:36.798
SUPPORTERS VERY FASCINATING WE

01:15:36.865 --> 01:15:38.367
SOUND LIKE YOUR CLASSIC KINDA

01:15:38.433 --> 01:15:41.770
LEFT RIGHT IN AND- IT SHOULD

01:15:41.837 --> 01:15:43.572
NOT BE REDUCED TO THAT THIS

01:15:43.639 --> 01:15:45.340
SHOULD BE REALLY A DEBATE

01:15:45.407 --> 01:15:47.342
AROUND THE INFORMATION THE

01:15:47.409 --> 01:15:50.279
PUBLIC. AND POLICY MAKERS NEED

01:15:50.345 --> 01:15:52.981
TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS

01:15:53.048 --> 01:15:55.050
WHICH WE DON'T HAVE. AND WHILE

01:15:55.117 --> 01:15:56.952
THERE IS A REFERENCE TO SHAME

01:15:57.019 --> 01:15:59.521
I'M NOT SURE- WHO WHO BROUGHT

01:15:59.588 --> 01:16:01.123
IT UP FOR WHAT COMMON MAYBE IT

01:16:01.189 --> 01:16:02.591
WAS A LETTER OF OPPOSITION.

01:16:02.658 --> 01:16:04.927
THAT IS NOT MY PURPOSE. WE

01:16:04.993 --> 01:16:06.929
ALREADY KNOW FROM THE SEC

01:16:06.995 --> 01:16:08.830
FILINGS WHAT LARGE COMPANIES

01:16:08.897 --> 01:16:11.233
DON'T PAY ANY FEDERAL TAXES SO

01:16:11.300 --> 01:16:12.834
BUT THE PURPOSE FOR ME IS NOT

01:16:12.901 --> 01:16:15.537
SHAME IT'S PURELY. FOR US TO BE

01:16:15.604 --> 01:16:19.007

DURING PART OF THE DOWNTURN.

01:16:23.078 --> 01:16:27.349
AND NOT HAVING GOOD ACCESS TO.

01:16:27.416 --> 01:16:29.551
THIS TYPE OF INFORMATION MAKES

01:16:29.618 --> 01:16:31.119
THE ABILITY TO DEBATE

01:16:31.186 --> 01:16:33.388
EXPENDITURES AND CUTS VERY

01:16:33.455 --> 01:16:35.590
DIFFICULT. MILEAGE PACKAGE

QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR. USUALLY

02:05:45.537 --> 02:05:47.273
I HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME WHEN

02:05:47.339 --> 02:05:49.008
SACRAMENTO GIVES A SALES TAX

02:05:49.074 --> 02:05:53.112
BREAK. ON PRODUCTS WHICH MEANS

02:05:53.178 --> 02:05:55.281
THAT THE LOCAL MUNICIPALITY

02:05:55.347 --> 02:05:57.116
CITY YOUR COUNTY WILL REALLY

02:05:57.182 --> 02:05:59.718
LOSE OUT ON. THE SALES TAX

02:05:59.785 --> 02:06:02.821
REVENUES I DON'T SEEM TO SEE IT

02:06:02.888 --> 02:06:04.823
OPPOSITION FROM THE CITIES. OR

02:06:04.890 --> 02:06:10.229
COUNTIES TO YOUR BILL- SO I

02:06:10.296 --> 02:06:13.299
GUESS I COULD. MODIFY MY

02:06:13.365 --> 02:06:14.700
APPROACH BUT I'M WONDERING

02:06:14.767 --> 02:06:17.903
INSTEAD OF. GIVING A SALES TAX

02:06:17.970 --> 02:06:19.939
BREAK WHICH MEANS THE LOCAL

02:06:20.005 --> 02:06:21.407
MUNICIPALITY WOULD LOSE A

02:06:21.473 --> 02:06:23.943
PORTION OF THE REVENUES WHY NOT

02:06:24.009 --> 02:06:26.011
HAVE THE STATE JUST GIVE- A

02:06:26.078 --> 02:06:28.847
REBATE FOR THE SALES TAX

02:06:28.914 --> 02:06:32.217
PORTION IT RECEIVES. SIR

02:06:46.665 --> 02:06:49.768

DIRECTLY HELP THEM. AND INDEED

02:07:00.379 --> 02:07:01.914
I'M GLAD THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

02:07:01.981 --> 02:07:03.382
