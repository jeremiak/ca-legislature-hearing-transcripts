AS WELL AS- AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS SO WITH THAT SECRETARY CROWFOOT GOOD MORNING. THANKS SO MUCH YOU'RE WHITE COUNTY AND SENATORS IT'S GREAT TO BE WITH YOU AGAIN AND MOST OF ALL RELEVANT TO THIS HEARING THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON TACKLING THAT GROWING CRISIS OF WILDFIRE IN CALIFORNIA. THEY WERE GONNA WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT OUR REQUEST TO YOU OR ONE ON ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS OF NEW INVESTMENT IN FRONT PROACTIVE ACTIONS TO REDUCE CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRE RISK I'M GONNA STEP BACK CONTACT FOR DISCUSSION HERE TODAY AND THEN TRYING TO JESSICA MORRIS I DID DETAILS ARE ARE PROPOSAL. SO WE OBVIOUSLY ALL KNOW THAT THE LAST WILDFIRE SEASON WAS REALLY CHALLENGING FOR- THE WORST WILDFIRES IN THE STATE ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY YEAR HISTORY. OCCURRED LAST YEAR ACROSS THE STATE BURNING TWO AND A HALF MILLION ACRES. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN IN THE STATE'S HISTORY TO WILDFIRES PREDICT THE AND CAL DOOR ACTUALLY TRAVELED OVER THE CREST OF THE SIERRA NEVADA SUMMIT INTO THE EASTERN SIERRA. THOSE FIRES WERE CHARACTERIZED BY FLAMES JUMPING OVER FIVE HUNDRED FOOT CLIFFS. I AM STARTING THREE MILE THE HEAD OF THE FIRE LINE AND AREAS OF- THAT THAT FOR IS BURNING AGAIN TWICE IN THE SAME FIRE. COMMUNITIES LIKE GRIZZLY FACT PLOTS IN GREENVILLE- TRAGICALLY DESTROYED DESTRUCTION OF OUR UPPER WATERSHED IN THE SIERRA THAT THE THOR'S OF 60% OF OUR STATE'S DRINKING WATER. LOST ABOUT 15220% OF OUR- THE WORLD'S LARGEST GIANT SEQUOIAS OFF OVER THE LAST TWO PIRACY THEM. REMARKABLY THOUGH FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A DECADE NO IT'S THE BILLION LIVES WERE LOST DUE TO THE HEROISM OF OUR CALIFORNIA FIREFIGHTERS AND OF COURSE OUR MUTUAL AID FIREFIGHTERS. REMARKABLE WE KNOW THAT BUILDING A RESPONSE CAPACITY IN THE STATE IN A CALIFORNIA FIRE CONTINUES TO BE CRITICAL MORE FIREFIGHTERS MORE EQUIPMENT MORE TECHNOLOGY. INCLUDING IMPORTANTLY STOPPING TO PROVIDE CRITICAL RELIEF TO OUR WILDFIRE FIREFIGHTERS DURING THE FIRE SEASON. BUT WE CLEARLY ARE NOT GOING TO SIMPLY RESPOND OUR WAY OUT OF THIS WILDFIRE CRISIS YOU ALL HAVE LED THE WAY POINTING OUT THAT WE NEED TO DO MORE PROACTIVE UPFRONT ACTIONS TO REDUCE. THE RISK. DYSTROPHIC WILDFIRE AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY. THE WAY I WOULD TALK ABOUT IT IS WHILE OUR WILDFIRE CHALLENGES GETTING WORSE OUR INTERVENTIONS ARE GETTING BETTER. WE SAW EFFORTS LIKE STRATEGIC FUEL BREAK HOME HARDENING AND PRESCRIBED FIRE WORKING LAST YEAR. HE WILL BREAK FOR EXAMPLE AROUND THE COMMUNITIES O SOUTH LAKE TAHOE AND POLLOCK PINES ALLOWED FIREFIGHTERS TO TAKE A STAND TO PROTECT NEIGHBORHOODS AND PROTECT THOSE COMMUNITIES- GRANDFATHERED IN THAT WHAT WE'RE DOING WHAT YOU'RE INVESTING IN IS WORKING- WE HAVE A STRATEGY THAT WE ARE FOCUSED LIKE A LASER ON IMPLEMENTING. WE KNOW HOW COLLECTIVELY TO BUILD WILDFIRE RESILIENCE. WITHIN COMMUNITIES HOME HARDENING INDEFENSIBLE SPACE AROUND COMMUNITIES- WITH THE STRATEGIC FUEL BREAK ALLOW FOR FIREFIGHTERS TO TAKE A STAND PROTECTING COMMUNITIES AND GIVING RESIDENTS TIME TO EVACUATE. AND ACROSS OUR BROADER LANDSCAPES TO LOWER THE INTENSITY OF WILDFIRE. AND A RESTORE FOREST HEALTH. NOW STRATEGIES ARE NOT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL TOP DOWN FROM SACRAMENTO ARE PROJECTS OUR WORK HAS TO BE DRIVEN BY REGIONAL PRIORITIES- BIG DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SOUTHERN AND NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND PARTS OF OUR STATE. AND THEY ALSO NEED TO BE GROUNDED IN FINANCE AND WE NEED TO ADAPTIVELY MANAGE BASED ON SCIENCE. YOUR POINT THAT WE ALWAYS MAKE IT WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO THIS ALONE- AND STATE GOVERNMENT OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OWNS 50% OF OUR FOREST LANDS THE STATE ONLY. OWNS ONLY THREE WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN SUBSIDIZING WORK ON FEDERAL LAND. IN AUGUST- TWENTY TWENTY GOVERNOR NEW SOME SIGNED A LANDMARK AGREEMENT WITH THE U. S. FOREST SERVICE. MAPPING OUT A TWENTY YEAR SHARED STRATEGY TO IMPROVE WILDFIRE RESILIENCE. IMPORTANTLY FOR THE FIRST TIME THE FOREST SERVICE COMMITTING TO BUY. TO FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES OF THE PROJECT A WILDFIRE RESILIENCE PROJECT BY THE YEAR TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AND OF COURSE THE STATE- PEOPLE LEADING COMMITTING TO THAT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES A PROJECT. TO MEET THESE GOALS ARE NOT SHARED. STEWARDSHIP AGREEMENT WE RESHAPE AND REVITALIZED THE STATE HOUSE FORCE WHICH WE CALL THE WILDFIRE AND FOREST RESILIENCE HALF FORCED. AND DEVELOPING AN ACTION PLAN WITH VERY SPECIFIC MEASURABLE ACTION THAT WE NEED TO TAKE. OUT TO REDUCE WILDFIRE RISK. HALF FORCED AND OUR ACCOUNTABILITY TO TAKE THOSE ACTIONS WAS CODIFIED BY SENATE BILL FOUR FIFTY SIX LAST YEAR. I AND WE HAVE PROVIDED A WRITTEN. IN SENSE TO ENSURE THAT THAT ACT WILDFIRES. ACTUALLY PLACE. WE WERE VERY GRATIFIED TO HEAR ABOUT PRESIDENT BY PRESIDENT HERE AT THE END U. S. FOR SERVICE ANNOUNCED EIGHT. MORE YEAR TEN YEARS. SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASING FEDERAL INVESTMENT AND FOCUS IN REDUCING WILDFIRE RISK- ALONG ACROSS NATIONAL BORDERS THE NOT GOING TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT. WE KNOW THAT SCALING UP INVESTMENT IS ESSENTIAL IF WE ARE ABLE TO RECEIVE THE ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS THAT WE'RE REQUESTING FOR THE LEGISLATURE THIS YEAR WE WILL TOTAL TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS OVER THREE YEARS AND WILDFIRE RESILIENCE. BY FAR THE LARGEST INVESTMENT WE'VE EVER MADE ON THAT FRONT. LAST YEAR'S INVESTMENT THANK YOU ALL CHAMPION THE AND GOT THROUGH THE PROCESS IS WORKING. IF YOU RECALL AT ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS WAS SPLIT INTO TWO PARTS BETTER PART OF IT WAS- VERY REMARKABLY APPROVED IN APRIL OF LAST YEAR OLD AND BURLY ACTION- BUDGET FOR WILDFIRE RESILIENCE THAT WAS ALL ABOUT FOCUSED ON GETTING THE FUNDING OUT OF THE DOOR. TO RIGHT SHOVEL READY TO REDUCE WILDFIRE RISK. I'M I'M EXCITED TO READ THE REPORT THAT THAT FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS IT ON THE GROUND IT LAUNCHED THREE HUNDRED FIFTEEN NEW WILDFIRE RESILIENCE PROJECT. IN LESS THAN A YEAR BOB SOME OF WHICH IMPACTED THE LAST FIRE SEASON SOME OF WHICH ARE POOREST ACTING- THE **** AND FIRE SEASON. A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES REALLY- MEETING PAUL IS THAT A GREAT THING FOR. THE APPLE FUNDED BY STATE COAST OPENED. STOP DELETE SOULFIRE I'M ONE OF ITS AYE EDGES IN SANTA BARBARA COUNTY. SAN DEGO CONSERVANCY PUT TO WORK FUNDING FOR DEFENSIBLE SPACE AROUND TWO HUNDRED LOW INCOME SAN DIEGO HOMES OUR BUYER STEPHEN. AND THE SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS CONSERVANCY FUNDED PERSON WATCH PROGRAM THAT FOUND ILLEGAL FIREWORKS THAT WERE DESTINED TO BE SENT OFF. IN THE SANTA MONICA. MOUNTAINS LAST INDEPENDENCE DAY. IN ADDITION TO THAT. AT THE WORKING DONE- ***- LEGISLATIVE CHANGES THE SHIP BUSINESS PRACTICE PRACTICE IT ENABLE THE PROJECT TO HAPPEN MORE QUICKLY. LEGISLATIVE CONTRACTING REALLY ENABLED AT HAND THEY TURN AROUND RATHER THAN A ONE YEAR TURNAROUND FOR STATE PROCUREMENT SEVERAL RATHER THAN THE LONGER SIX TO NINE MONTH PROCESS AND INVOLVED FOCUSED ON SHARPENING SHOVEL READY PROJECT. BUT EARLY ACTION PLANNING WAS IMPORTANT AT THE SAME TIME THE REST REST OF THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION NINE HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS APPROVED IN SEPTEMBER. IS WAS DESIGNED TO INTENTIONALLY CREATE A LONGER LINE OF FUNDING FOR PROJECTS. ARE PRIORITIZED BY REGION. GOOD NEWS THAT OVER TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OF THOSE FUNDS HAVE ALREADY BEEN COMMITTED OR A HUNDRED ONE PROJECT AND GRANT. IT PRETTY REMOTE BEFORE LAST AT THE STATE'S ENTIRE WILDFIRE RESILIENCE BUDGET WAS ABOUT TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. AND LESS THAN A YEAR COLLECTIVELY WORKING ACROSS AGENCIES AND WITH THE LEGISLATURE WE PUT. NEW SCALED UP FUNDING TO WORK THREE TIMES THAT AMOUNT INTO PROGRAMS. AND WE'RE REALLY EXCITED WE'VE GOT THIS REGIONAL FOREST AND FIRE CAPACITY PROGRAM WHICH IS BUILDING CAPACITY IN THE REGION SO WHERE YOU REPRESENT- TO BE COUNTY THAT CITY THE RESOURCE CONSERVATION DISTRICT BUT CONSERVANCY ARE COMING TOGETHER TO IDENTIFY WHAT ARE THE PRIORITY PROJECT- HARDENING IT IS MAKING GREAT STRIDES THANKS TO THE LEADERSHIP OF OCT FIVE BAG GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES AND OTHERS. WATCHING THREE PILOT PROGRAMS INSTANTIATE GO LAKE AND SHOP THE COUNTY. WE'VE GOT FINANCED BY BEING PUT TO- AND I DON'T WEBER FEDERAL FUNDING TO GET TO ARE CRITICAL WATERSHED COVER BY LAW REMOTE SENSING. AND WE'RE BACK PRIVATE CATHOLIC IT'S FINE TO APPROVE BY THE BEING JUST WEEKS AGO- ALLOWED OPR TWO ONE A SERIES OF HIGH PROJECTS FOR. TWENTY BE IN STOCK OR HOW TO READ HOW TO UTILIZE THIS. COMING OUT OF POOREST. AND THEN LASTLY THE COW DEDICATION REATMENT PROGRAM OR CAL BTP I WHICH IS ALL ABOUT STREAMLINING FOR PROJECT. IS NOW IN PLACE AND BEGINNING TO WORK ASCENTIAL A LIKE A THREE IN ONE. LOCATION TO GET- SPEAK FOR APPROVAL A WATER BOARD APPROVAL INTERACTION WILDLIFE APPROVAL AND WE'RE SEEING A TOP TAKE. AND WEALTHY WHAT WE ANTICIPATE TO BE SIGNIFICANT UPTAKE OF CAL BGT. OVERTIME WHERE WE WE'VE COME FROM AND WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW AND IT POINT IS GOING TO. ONE DEPARTMENTS ACROSS FORTY. PRETTY REFER REMARKABLE- AND SO I WANTED TURN NOW TO GET THE GOVERNOR AS HARD. SECRETARY ON THE PRIORITY TO TALK ABOUT SPECIFICALLY SENATORS WE'RE REQUESTING. IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET. IT SECRETARY- AND THANK YOU MEMBERS OF THE SENATE AND REALLY GRATEFUL FOR ALL OF YOUR SUPPORT YOUR LEADERSHIP AND YOUR PARTNERSHIP AND HELPING US ESTABLISH- AND SCALE WILDFIRE RESILIENCE IN CALIFORNIA IN SUCH A SUBSTANTIVE WAY I'M- WHAT ARE. LAST YEAR WE HAD THOSE EARLY ACTION DOLLARS WHICH WERE REALLY STRANGE. UP TO A MUCH HIGHER. ACTIVITY AND MOVING A HIGHER PACE. THIS YEAR FROM ONE TWO BILLION DOLLARS OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS IN WILDFIRE RESILIENCE IS DESIGNED TO BUILD ON THOSE INVESTMENTS AND TAKE US FROM A SPRINT. TO A MARATHON PEACE AT THAT MUCH HIGHER VOLUME AND LEVEL OF ACTIVITY SO WE HAVE GONE FROM SPRING CHANGE TO NOW SCALING AND SUSTAINING AND MAINTAINING THIS MUCH LARGER SCALE OF ACTIVITY THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT WERE WORKING ON. THIS INVESTMENT- NEARER THE INVESTMENTS WE MADE LAST YEAR IT BUILDS ON THIS FORTY PROJECTS THAT THE PROGRAMS THAT SECRETARY CLOSELY- WAYS DETAILING SO WE ARE CONTINUING OUR INVESTMENTS- ACROSS THOSE DEBRIS FRIENDS OF FIRE RESILIENCE SO ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE TO LOWER FUEL INTENSITY SPECIFIC PROJECTS ACROSS THEIR FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS. WE'RE PLAYING FOR PROJECTS ACROSS THAT LANDSCAPE LEVEL SO THESE INCLUDE PROGRAMS LIKE THE POOREST HEALTH GRANT PROGRAMS- CONTINUE DIRECT INVESTMENT GRANT PROGRAM FOR TRIBES I'M SPECIFIC SUPPORT FOR SMALL COURSE OF LANDOWNERS WHO MAKE UP ABOUT 26% OF THE FOREST LANDS IN CALIFORNIA- THE END FUNDING FOR ENSURING THAT OUR STATE LAND HOLDINGS HE'S REALLY PRECIOUS HABITATS AND RESOURCES. THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS LOVE THAT DOES CONTINUE TO BE MAINTAINED AND PROTECTED. FOR WILDFIRE RESILIENCE. SO WE ARE WE'RE ACROSS THE RESULTS LANDSCAPE AND LAYER RESEARCH ME FOR ON OUR- THE INVEST ARE COME. THINGS LIKE STE YOU'LL BRING- ESCAPE ROUTES OVER ROW. I'M AND WORK AND THAT A SO WE ARE CAN. AND INVESTMENT OF THREE HUNDRED AND TWO MILLION PREVENTION GRANT PROGRAMS LIKE THE CAL FIRE- UNIT. YOU'LL BREAK PROGRAMS AND LIKE OUR I INVESTMENTS IN. THE FORESTRY CORPS IN OTHERS THE CDC. WILL HELP US ENSURE THAT WE HAVE EDUCATION MANAGEMENT GOING ON STRATEGICALLY AND COHESIVELY AROUND COMMUNITIES. LAST ON A IN IN HOME HARDENING DEFENSE SPACE MILLION INTO PRO THAT ARE FOCUSED ON OUR COMMUNITY HARDENING ACROSS THESE AREAS INCLUDING BUILDING ON THOSE PILOT PROJECTS THAT ADD THE JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY BETWEEN HOW FIRE AND HELLO YES WHICH JUST LAUNCHED LAST YEAR. ON THE ARE GOING TO BE DEMONSTRATING DIRECT SUPPORT FOR LOWER INCOME CALIFORNIANS AS WELL AS EDUCATION AND OUTREACH. OR AND I THAT YEAH TO MAKE THESE BUT BASIC RETROFITS AND DO THAT DEFENSIBLE WORK WE'RE ALSO INVESTING IN THE STRUCTURE THAT WILL ALLOW US TO. MAINTAIN THE SCALE SMARTLY SAFELY AND IN A WAY THAT CONTINUES TO INVEST IN A WORLD JOBS AND COMMUNITIES SO WE ARE GOING TO BE CONTINUING TO INVEST- IN SCIENCE BASED MANAGEMENT THIRTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS. OUR PROGRAMS TO CONTINUE ON DURING OUR BROWN DEALING GATHERING SUCH AS THE FOREST INVENTORY PLOTS WHICH IS WHY WE RETURN TO THE SAME- THE OVER YEAR AFTER YEAR ON THROUGHOUT THE STATE. IS TO BE ABLE TO ACT ON- THE IMPACTS OF CHANGE OUR ON. ON SPECIFIC FORCE AREA ALSO INVESTING IN RESEARCH AND GRANT FUNDING AND THEN IN CREASING OUR INVESTMENTS- FOR SPATIAL DATA ACQUISITION AND BUILDING ON THAT INTERVIEW THREE YEARS AS WELL. WE'RE ALSO CONTINUING OUR INVESTMENTS IN THE FORCED ECONOMIC STIMULUS FORTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS UNLESS YOU CONTINUE INVESTMENTS IN OUR PLAYERS WORKFORCE AND BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT GRANTS. TO EXPAND INVESTMENT IN THESE PILOT PROJECTS AT THE OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH TO BE ABLE TO YOU KNOW- ESTABLISHED STREAMLINING- WHAT HE BIOMASS SECTORS. AND THEN THERE'S SOME NEW INVESTMENTS- PROGRAMS IN THAT. SECTOR AS WELL. YOU DAHLE IN OUR I'M ACTIVITIES WITH VEGETATION MANAGEMENT AND ALSO POST FIRE RECOVERY WE'RE SEEING GROWING INCREASES OF SLASH PILES THROUGHOUT THE FOREST WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE DIRECT FUNDING. TO BE ABLE TO YOU KNOW- SUBSIDIZED REMOVING THOSE FLASH FILES TO A BETTER DESTINATION THAN JUST OPEN ILE BURNING IN THE FOREST LAST YEAR WE SAW CAL FIRE HAD TO DEDICATE ENTIRE OF FIRE ENGINES CHIU ARMIES LARGE SLASH PILES AND JUST AS A POINT OF PERSPECTIVE THEY CAN SOMETIMES. BE THE SIZE OF A STRIP MALL- AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE IN BED QUICKLY AND EFFICIENTLY WE'RE MOVING NOW SLASH PILES INTO YOU. BUSINESS I BUSINESSES THAT CAN BETTER UTILIZE THEM SO THAT THEY DON'T JUST GET OPEN PILE BURNED OR ARE TAKEN UP IN A FIRE. THERE'S ALSO A NEW INVESTMENT FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS INTO REFORESTATION THIS IS A PILOT PROGRAM THAT WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO FOCUS ON THOSE CRITICAL WATERSHEDS- AND REALLY TARGETED RECOVERY OF CRITICAL WATERS. BECAUSE WE'RE SEEN OUR NATURAL INFRASTRUCTURE DEVASTATED BY THESE FIRES SO THE DIXIE FIRE BURNED NEARLY ONE MILLION ACRES. I'M IN D. I. IN THE FEATHER RIVER WATERSHED WHICH IS THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE STATE WATER PROJECT AND I SECRETARY CROWFOOT MANSION ALSO THE CALIBER CHOIR IN THE TAMARACK FIRE WERE CREDIBLY UNUSUAL. IN THAT HIGH INTENSITY BURNT IN UPPER WATERSHED AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE HAVING TARGETED INVESTMENTS TO HELP RECOVER AND G. AND INVEST NOT ONLY DIRECTLY IN REINFORCED ASIAN BUT ALSO THE REFORESTATION INFRASTRUCTURE INCLUDING NURSERIES. FEEDBACK COLLECTION- AND THE WORK FORCE TO BE ABLE TO ENSURE THAT OUR NATURAL INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS PROVIDING CRITICAL WATERSHED AND HELPING TO MITIGATE DROUGHT IN CALIFORNIA. IT'S QUICK AND DIRECTOR COVERAGE AFTER THESE CATASTROPHIC FIRES THE LAST NEW PROGRAM THAT I WANT TO HIGH. IN THE BUDGET. THIRTY MILLION DOLLAR MORE DEFENSIBLE SPACE FOR STATE- AS AS YOU KNOW LAST YEAR THE LARGEST- INCREASED SPACE NAY YOUR IT NOT BY FOOT NINE PLAN WILL LAUNCH SO WE TO MAKE WE HAD TO ONE OVER THE YEAR TO ENSURE THAT OUR STATE PARK SPECIAL WILDLIFE- AT THIS SCALP WHERE YOU KNOW ANY OF THOSE FACILITY THAT ARE IN THE WILL WE THAT THEY HAVE- THAT TOOLS A QUICK- YEAH SURE THE THEY ARE. PROTECTED AND HAVE THAT DEFENSIBLE SPACE BORDER I'D STATE VISITOR CENTERS AND THE LIKE SO WE ARE SO GRATEFUL FOR YOUR INVESTMENTS IT IS BUILDING ON AGAIN WE SEARCH FOR THOSE EARLY ACTION DOLLARS YOU GAVE US TOOLS TO WORK QUICKLY ARE OUR OUR DEPARTMENTS DELIVERED WE ARE NOW WORKING ON CHANGING THAT HIGH SCALE- AND THIS INVESTMENT WILL ALLOW US TO CONTINUE THAT OUR AT A MUCH LARGER PASTE- AFFORD THE COMING YEARS TO DELIVER CRITICAL WILDFIRE RESILIENCE ACTIVITIES THAT WE HAVE THAT OUT. TO WORK CALIFORNIA THANK. YOU FOR YOUR PARTNERSHIP AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP. THANK I'M I'M SURE THE OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE- MEMORIES DON'T NEED TO BE REACHED. LAST MAY WHEN THIS SUBCOMMITTEE INCREASED YEARLY FIRE I FUNDING BY A QUARTER MILLION DOLLARS IN AN INCREASE THE REGULAR FUNDING. BY A QUARTER MILLION DOLLARS FOR AN INCREASE OF FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND SO WE'RE WE'RE GLAD FOR THAT UPDATE I KNOW MY MEMBERS HAVE. QUESTIONS LET'S GO TO THE FINANCE DEPARTMENT DO YOU HAVE. THAT WE'RE ALL FAMILIAR WITH EVERYBODY'S ROLE HERE IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU CAN ADD. ON THE DETAILS OF THIS OF THE DECISIONS THAT YOU'VE MADE FOR FOUR HUNDRED MILLION THE GENERAL FUNDS FOR RESILIENCY IN THIS YEAR'S PACKAGE. YES SIR DRIVE ARE WITH PART OF FINANCIAL SECTOR MEMBERS SO THIRTY KROPA AND EVERY THIRD CARRY MORE THAN A GREAT JOB OF HIGHLIGHTING THAT THE GREAT EAGLE COMPONENTS JUST REALLY WANNA HIGHLIGHT ARE WE LOOKING AT THIS YEAR'S EVENT THAT COMBINED WITH LAST YEAR'S- IT. TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT OVER FOUR YEARS FOR SOME CRITICAL WILDFIRE GOING PROGRAMS AND LAST YEAR'S BUDGET- WE ALSO. MADE B. TWO HUNDRED MILLION TO EUROPE A TRULY CONTINUE. APPROPRIATION WHERE THEY ARE NOW THAT BUILT INTO THE BASELINE FOR A CALIFORNIA'S BUDGET ACROSS SEVERAL U. PROGRAM SO IT BUDGET CONTINUES. THAT DOESN'T PROVIDE A BASELINE LEVEL UP- FUNDING- OR WHAT PART OF THE PROGRAM AND ITS KINDA LAUGHING ALTHOUGH- I KNOW WE HAVE PROVIDED SOME- KIND OF INITIAL FIGURES- BUT YOUR STAFF AND AN ALLEY- ON. SOME OF THE- ABOUT OF THE MONEY FOR MY YEAR- BY IN N. B. IN LAST YEAR'S THAT RECORDING THAT RIGHT LITTLE BIT DETAILED. OUR GOAL IS THAT TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SOME MORE D. NUMBER ON- LAST YEAR IN THAT AND BUILD OUT COME THAT APRIL ONE OR FORTY DEADLINE. WELL SIR THE TO SEVEN- BILLION HAS BEEN HIGH ON RECENTLY IN. IS AN IMPROVEMENT- OVER WHAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING JUST AGAIN FOR THE PUBLIC'S REFRESHING THIS SUBCOMMITTEE WAS THE SUBCOMMITTEE THAT INSISTED ON HAVING TWO HUNDRED MILLION IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN. FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT WE GET THAT THRESHOLD SO WE'RE NOT THIS IS NOT NEW NEWS FOR US ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF DOING PREVENTION WORK. BEFORE JUST PUTTING MONEY ON SUPPRESSION WE HAVE A RICH HISTORY WE'LL GET TO THAT IN THE NEXT SEGMENT BUT- THE BALL STARTED IN SUBCOMMITTEE TWO ON TWO HUNDRED MILLION BACK IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN. LAST MAY WE REPORTED OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE A PROGRAM FOR A BILLION DOLLARS ON PREVENTION OVER FIVE YEARS THAT IS. NOW THAT HAS EVER BEEN PUT UP A DEADLY BEEN RESPONDED WITH SIX HUNDRED MILLION BY THE ADMINISTRATION THAT WAS A BILLION THAT WE HAD WE HAD ASKED TO BE PUT IN SO. LMAO CAN WE HAVE YOUR COMMENTS ON THE RESILIENCY PACKAGE PERFECT PROPOSED. BY THE ADMINISTRATION CENTERS MY NAME IS TELLING CRISTINA THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOU INVITING US TO SPEAK TODAY. AND SO WE HAVE SOME RECENTLYRELEASED A RECORD THAT HAS SOME HIGH LEVEL ACCESS MANAGEMENT CONDITIONS ON A PACKAGE THAT'S REFLECTED REALLY WELL IN YOUR AGENDA- AND ALSO OUR REPORT IS AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE AND I'LL BRIEFLY SUMMARIZE IT AND TODAY I KNOW THAT WE HAVE A LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME. I SO OVERALL WE FIND THAT THE CONTINUED AND THE SAYS ON MY VERY MITIGATION AND PREVENTION REALLY HAS A LOT OF MERIT AND AS YOU MENTIONED CHAIR THIS IS AN AREA HUGE INTEREST FOR THIS COMMITTEE- AND IT'S REALLY BEEN AN IMPORTANT AREA FOR THE STATE TO FOCUS ON GETTING. THE RECENT VERY LARGE AND VERY SEVERE AND DAMAGING WILDFIRES THE STATE'S EXPERIENCE- SO WE DEFINITELY THINK IT'S REASONABLE TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT- THIS AREA AND A RANGE OF TAKES ACTIVITIES IN THIS AREA BOTH. HELP MAKE OUR NATURAL LANDSCAPES MORE RESILIENT AND ALSO PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES- PEOPLE'S HOMES AND THEIR. BUSINESSES THOSE TYPES OF THINGS. HOWEVER WE DO HAVE TO NAMES. REALLY ON THAT WE CAN LEGISLATURE SHE CAN SAY. AND EVALUATE THIS BUT- PACKAGE I SUPPORT WE RECKON THE LOGISTICS CONSIDER THE TOLL FUNDING LEVEL WELL AS THE OF PROGRAMS IN THE- OF ITS PRIORITY. THAT ARE COMING ON BACK. COMPANY OF PROGRAMS AND FUNDING LEVELS AND IT'S REALLY SOMETHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE GONNA WANT TO WEIGH IN ON AND BASED ON ITS PRIORITIES. I DID THAT SO WE IDENTIFY SOME FACTORS WE THINK ARE VALUABLE TO CONSIDER- INCLUDING THE EXTENT TO WHICH FRIENDS PROTECT STATE ASSETS WHICH WE THINK IS A WORTHY GOAL. AS WELL AS VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. I'M SO SECOND WE RECOMMEND. YOU TO FOR ACTION ON THAT PACKAGE UNTIL THIS SPRING WHEN ADDITIONAL INFORMATION SHOULD BE AVAILABLE AND TO HELP INFORM DECISION MAKING AND THERE ARE. A FEW SPECIFIC PIECES OF INFORMATION WE THINK WOULD BE. ESPECIALLY HELPFUL FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO HAVE THOSE. FACILITATE ITS DECISION ON. SOME PARTICULAR ME THINKING THAT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO HAVE SOME MORE DETAILS ON THE PROGRAM PROPOSED FOR FUNDING IS FOR THE PACKAGE- SO WE KNOW THAT IN A NUMBER OF CASES THERE'S STILL LIMITED INFORMATION AT THIS TIME ON THE SPECIFICS OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. ON FOR EXAMPLE AS WAS NOTED AND BY THE ADMINISTRATION THERE ARE A FEW NEW PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN FUNDED AND HALF PACKAGES- THAT ARE PROPOSED TO BE MADE AS PART OF THIS PACKAGE- FOR EXAMPLE THE SEXY FOR THE TRANSPORTATION OF WOODY BIOMASS. CAN YOU PRINT THAT REFORESTATION AND DEMONSTRATION FORCE FOR EXAMPLE- OF THESE NEW PROGRAMS WE THINK GENERALLY ADDRESS IMPORTANT AND WORTHY ISSUES THERE JUST ISN'T A LOT OF INFORMATION ON HOW THEY ARE EXPECTED TO BE IMPLEMENTED. ON THE RATIONALE FOR THE PROPOSED SPECIFIC PROPOSED FUNDING AMOUNT AND HOW THEY'LL INTERACT WITH EXISTING STATE PROGRAMS WHICH MAY IN SOME. CASES YOU SOME OF THE SAME THING IMPORTANT TO HAVE- FOR THE FOR LEGISLATURE TO MAKE. DECISIONS ABOUT HOW HE WANTS TO. FREE OF THESE PRO. AND WE DON'T NOTE THAT THERE IS. PRINT OF THE THAT PROGRAMS WERE FINDING AND YOU HER ABOUT THAT YET OF COURSE THE COMEDIAN. VERY INTIMATE. AWARE OF THAT OU PACKAGES THAT WERE APPROVED LAST. YEAR AND THIS. FOR BY. IN MANY CASES A SIMILAR PROGRAM. OR THE AND HE THE SAME PROGRAM EXPENSE AT THE SAME PROGRAM- AND- HE SAYS THERE'S LESS. AND ON THE OUTCOMES OF THAT IS THAT FINDING BECAUSE REALLY YEAH I WAS. PRETTY RECENTLY THAT A LOT OF THAT FINDING- WENT OUT THE DOOR. I'M SO AS WAS MENTIONED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ARE THERE IS THAT A REPORT THAT'S ANTICIPATED TO BE AVAILABLE IN APRIL. AND THEN WE HOPE THAT WILL HELP ON RIGHT EVEN SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON OUTCOMES AND THE STATUS OF THE EXPENDITURE OF THOSE FUNDS WHICH CAN HELP. DECISION MAKING. I WANT TO DEDICATE MORE MONEY IN YOU KNOW PROGRAMS THAT HAVE- ATTRACT OF GETTING MANY THE DOOR MORE FOR AND SO IF WE SEE AFTER THEM FOR ON I'M KIND OF HOW THOSE ARE ARE GETTING MONEY OUT ON THE CAN HELP INFORM THE LEGISLATURE. I'M THIRD. WE RECOMMEND THE LEGACY CONSIDER ALTERNATIVE TO IT YOU FUNDING PLAN- AND I AS WITH MANY- VERY CONTINUOUS. OF THAT G. AT AND- TRAITS. BUT THE GENERAL FUND. A REAL PROPOSED JUST FOR A TWO YEAR. WE THINK THERE'S A TRADE OFF AND CHALLENGES THAT APPROACH ON THIS. SOME ACTIVITIES REALLY REQUIRES SUSTAINED ONGOING BINDING THEY'RE JUST NOT ONE AND DONE TYPE OF THING. OTHERS ARE BEING FUNDED BY THE TEACHER ASKED BY THEIR CAP AND TRADE. BUT THE MINIMUMS ARE PROPOSED TO BE FUNDED- FROM GENERAL FUND- AND IF YOU THINK YOU THINGS LIKE DEFENSIBLE SPACE. THAT THINGS THAT- YOU WERE VEGETATION GROWS BACK. AND YOU REALLY MAY NEED SOME SOME ONGOING. ACTIVITIES SO THOSE ARE THE TYPES OF PROGRAMS THAT COULD BE GOOD CANDIDATES POTENTIALLY FOR SOME LEVEL OF ON GOING FUNDING. AND WE ALSO KNOW THERE ARE SOME PROGRAMS- WHERE THERE ISN'T A LOT OF DETAIL- I% FOR A LOT OF INFORMATION YET THEY'RE JUST GETTING GOING. FOR EXAMPLE. I'M DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE. FUNDING WOULD BE FOR THAT SECOND YEAR THE TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR YEAR. I'M GOING TO TAKE A PROGRAM THAT COULD. MERIT WHAT YOU'RE FINDING POTENTIAL IN THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER- HOW MUCH MUCH DIFFERENT NEXT YEAR SO. I'M WE THINK YOU COULD CONSIDER OTHER APPROACHES TO THIS YEAR ANY PLAN. I'M FOURTH WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDE SUCH AS WHERE YOU GUIDANCE TO FOR PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION. AS RELEVENT AND WE IDENTIFY A COUPLE PROGRAMS INCLUDING THE REGIONAL FORCING PARK PASSED THE PROGRAMS. AND THE DEFENSE OF DEFENSE CREATE SPACE PROGRAM EXCUSE ME. I'M THAT WE THINK COULD BENEFIT FROM SUCH GUIDANCE BASED ON SOME RECENT PROGRAM EVALUATIONS AT OUR OFFICE CONDUCTED. I'M AND THEN FINALLY WE'D RECOMMEND LEGISLATURE CONTINUE ITS OVERSIGHT ACTIVITIES AND AS AS I KNOW BEEN A BIG. AREA OF INTEREST IN OVERSIGHT LEGISLATURE READING THAT'S REALLY VALUABLE. GIVEN HOW IMPORTANT THIS ISSUE IS GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT HAS BEEN SPENT IN REALLY GIVEN THAT THIS IS AN ISSUE THE LEGISLATURE GONNA. PUBLIC ENEMY CONTINUING TO TACKLE I WANTED TO DEDICATE FUNDS TO IN THE FUTURE. JUST PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT TO GET LESSONS LEARNED. HOW ARE THINGS GOING. WAY WAY THAT WE CAN CONTINUE I THINK- AS AS A WHOLE AND TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT. THESE ARE- OPERATING DEFECTIVE. AND EFFICIENT MANNER SO HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS ALSO IF. I KNOW I THINK THERE'S A SECOND. MISS ROY CAN WE ESTABLISH A QUORUM WE PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. WHAT KASKY HERE NINE YEARS MCGUIRE STERN HERE. WE HAVE CORPS MISSES THE ABOLITION FROM. LET'S GO TO THE MUCH PUBLICIZED AGREEMENT WITH THE U. S. FOREST SERVICE AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE WANT TO REMOVE A HUNDRED. OR MILLION OR THREE MILLION ACRES OF FOREST LAND- IN WHICH SET A DATE OF TWENTY TWENTY FIVE WHERE ARE WE TODAY HOW MUCH OF OUR RESOURCES ACHIEVING THAT GOAL AND WHAT IS THE ADDITIONAL AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT YOU WOULD NEED TO GET TO. THE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES AS PART OF OUR SHARE. YEAH I THINK. THEY'RE ALL TAKEN I THINK IT'S CRACK AT PROVIDING CONTACT AND I JUST LOOK AT BY. ANY OTHER DETAIL THAT YOU CAN PROVIDE. SO I'M OUR PERSPECTIVE THIS MILLION ACRES I SHARED TARGET IS A REALLY IMPORTANT NORTHSTAR AND INDICATE DOES THE SCALE OF. OF WORK THAT WE WANT TO DO ACROSS THE STATE. IT'S REQUIRING STEPS TO A- ONE OF WHICH ARE CREATING A- CONSISTENT CENTRALIZED ACCOUNTING SYSTEM AND DEFINITION OF PROJECT. SO YOU CAN IMAGINE ALPIREZ OUR STATE FORESTRY DEPARTMENT HAS FOR SOME TIME BEEN WORKING ON PROJECTS FOR OTHER REASON DECADE. PART OF HOW WE'RE GOING TO ACCOMPLISH THIS TARGET IS CHEN SIGNIFICANTLY BROUGHT IN THE AMOUNT OF GROUPS I. ADVOCATE WITHIN STATE GOVERNMENT ARE WORKING ON THAT SO. THANK YOUR STATE CONSERVANCY STATE PARKS- THE DEPARTMENT ADDITION WILDLIFE. AND EACH OF THOSE ENTITIES THAT DOESN'T HAVE NECESSARILY THE SAME SYSTEM FOR TRACKING PROJECT AND SO. I SHARE I WOULD SAY THAT SWITCHES I'M NOT ABLE TO GIVE YOU A NUMERIC NUMBER. TODAY BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT. WE VERY MUCH RECOGNIZED BEST TWENTY FIVE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE COMMITMENT OF THE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND YEAH PROJECT ACRES UP FOR THE STATE AND THE DEATH. OR DEVELOPING THAT- THAT ACCOUNTING SYSTEM REALLY BUILDING UP HELP I RESPOND ASIAN AND THEN ENSURING THAT THE OTHER ENTITIES WERE WITH IN THE STATE I- CAN ACTUALLY PLUG INTO THOSE PROJECT ACRES AND THEN. AND THEN AND THEN WORK THROUGH OUR TASK FORCE REALLY WORKING THROUGH. HOW WE ACCOUNT FOR EXAMPLE WILDFIRE MITIGATION PROJECTS COMPLETED BY UTILITIES OR YOU KNOW COMMERCIAL FORESTRY. I'M SO THIS IS A QUESTION THAT THAT WE EXPECT TO BE CONTINUE TO BE ASKED AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE- YOU KNOW A MORE PRECISE ANSWER FOR HERE IN COMING MONTHS. AT THANK. IN STANDARD UP THE A COW FOR THE PROJECT THAT ARE UNDER. TO THEY CAN GUESS THE OTHER GROUP HERE IS OUR- PARTNERS IN THE THERE'S P. THAT ARE IN INTERESTED IN BIO MASTERS. THAT ORANGE IN BY CHAR THERE'S PEOPLE ORDER INTERESTED IN IN CHIPPING THEIR PEOPLE INTERESTED IN IN WONDERING YEAH THEY WANT THEY THEY WANT TO ASSIST CALIFORNIA IN THE THINNING OF THEIR FOURS AND EVERYBODY HAS. EVERYBODY'S ON THE FOOD CHAIN A LITTLE- DIFFERENTLY SO THERE IS A MOSAIC. AT LEAST IN MY MIND THERE'S A MOSAIC THAT SAYS HOW DOES IT HOW DO WE ACHIEVE THAT YOU KNOW FIRST. YOU NEED TO THIN THE WINDER SAID THIS IS A TICKET SOME OF THESE AREAS THAT NEED TO ACTUALLY GET IN SO THAT YOU CAN GO NGUYEN AND DETERMINE WHICH TREES NEED TO BE REMOVED. AND BEFORE YOU EVEN GET THE PRESCRIBER ANSWERS PRESCRIBED BURNS ARE AFTER YOU'VE HAD A TREATMENT AND I KNOW. EVERYBODY ON THIS CALL UNDERSTAND STAT- BUT- BUT THE FOOD CHAIN I GUESS IS WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS SAID YOU KNOW THIS COMMITTEE. HAD LAST YEAR SUGGESTED HAD IN THE BUDGET TEN MILLION FOR THROUGH REMOVING BIO MASS FROM THE CHAMBERS THAT WAS TAKEN OUT BY THIS ADMINISTRATION AND THE- BUT JUST SO EVERYBODY KNOWS WE'RE GLAD TO SEE IT BACK. BUT I THINK MY COMMENT WAS PROBABLY A MORE APPROPRIATE FIGURE WAS FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT WE SHOULD BE DOING BECAUSE THAT'S THE FIRST STEP IN GETTING. THE CREATING THOSE TIMBER DEPOTS WERE TALKING ABOUT THE OLD K. MARKS WHEREVER THESE SHOPPING CENTERS WERE ALL THIS PRODUCT IS GOING THROUGH SO CAN YOU. TELL US A LITTLE BIT THERE. ABOUT WHAT GLOBIS IS DOING. WHAT YOU WERE- HI MATE CATTLE. FUND HAD THE FUNDS HAVE A GONE IN BUT WE'RE THE PER. INTO FORESTRY OR ECOSYSTEM HOW'RE WE GETTING OR PARTNERS GIVING THEM GRANTS TO RAMP UP SO THAT THEY BECOME THEY GET THEY GET IN THE WITH THE WORK FLOW. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE QUESTION AND- AND IT'S REALLY VITAL. THAT WE ENSURE THAT WHILE WE'RE DELIVERING RESILIENCE FOR CALIFORNIA IT'S ALSO WE CAN'T DO IT WITHOUT INCREASING THE ENTIRE SORT OF WOOD PRODUCTS- A INDUSTRY AND SECTOR AND THAT'S EVERYTHING FROM SORT OF TRADITIONAL LUMBER- CHU INNOVATIVE WOOD PRODUCTS. AND THERE'S A NUMBER OF INVESTMENTS WE MADE LAST YEAR AND WE WANT WE WANT TO BUILD ON THIS YEAR THAT ARE REALLY STARTING TO BE VERY DELIBERATE ABOUT ENSURE ENSURING THAT THAT SPEED STOCK SUPPLIES WHAT WE CALL IT SORT OF WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THE WAR AND HOW DO YOU GET WHAT OUT OF. THE FOREST THAT'S OVERSTOCK HOW DO YOU GET WHAT OUT OF SLASH PILES HOW DO YOU GET THAT BURKE POST FIRE- LLOYD EACH INTO EIGHT AS A WHOLE AND FEEDSTOCK SUPPLY CHAIN SO THAT THEN DRIVES- AN ECONOMY. WHICH BEGAN OF NEEDS ARE ENVIRONMENTAL ECOLOGICAL GOALS BECAUSE IT IS ALWAYS BETTER- IT'S YOU HAVE A DESTINATION FOR THIS RATHER THAN HAVE IT. IN A FIRE OR OTHER ELDRIDGE SO HERE'S A COUPLE ACTIVITIES THAT ARE UNDER WAY RIGHT NOW THE CLIMATE CATALYST ONE OF FORTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS I'M EASE AVAILABLE NOW- JUST APPROVED BY THE I. BANK THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP IN GETTING THAT THROUGH LAST YEAR. AND IT IS AVAILABLE TO GIVE LOANS AND GRANTS OR LOANS AND LOAN GUARANTEES ME TO KNOW OUR BUSINESS. THAT ARE WORKING ON WHAT INNOVATION AND TRADITIONAL TRADITIONAL OUT WHAT PRODUCTS AS WELL SO ANYTHING THAT IS SUPPORTING A BUSINESS THAT CAN SUPPORT THAT SUPPLY CHAIN OR SOMEBODY NEEDS BUSINESS CAPITAL EQUIPMENT- THEY CAN GET A LOWER LOAN GUARANTEES. FROM THE BANK- SO THAT THEY'RE NOT BEING TURNED AWAY THEY'VE BEEN TURNED AWAY BEFORE BY COMMERCIAL BANKS SO THAT'S EVERYTHING FROM TRADITIONAL SAWMILLS CHINO- GEOTAGGING YOUR MASTER NUMBER FACILITIES- AND INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS THAT CAN CONVERT THAT WOODY MATERIAL INTO. NATURAL GAS OR WHAT. REPLACEMENT SO. I CAN'T FIND IT. FOR TO HELP. GROW ANY. THIS IN THE SACK. WE GOT TYLER I PILOTS THAT ARE WORKING ON. STOCK OF WIDE CONTRA. SO ARE TRYING TO ACCURATE. EACH I'LL COME OUT OF SO WE- SLASH PILES I'M- COMING OF THE SMALLER CRIMES- IN REGION AND BE ABLE TO SAY HOW WE- GIVE OUT TENURE SO. OF GREEN. SHOULD BE SPACE AS SO THAT THEY CAN ALONG TERM. TO AND KNOW THAT THEY CAN BUILD UP THEIR- ONE PRODUCTS CAMPUS- BECAUSE THEY CAN GET BEING. TEN YEARS THE STOCK SUPPLY. AND THAT I. THAT'S IN COMP. WERE ALSO INVESTING IN A GREAT FROM FOR A FORCE TO. AND THE TO. I WAS TWENTY FOUR DOLLARS LAST YEAR WE WERE MORE THIS YEAR- WITH CAL FIRE THAT'S IN PROGRAM SO. THE I'D THAT IS JUST GETTING ONE THOSE ARE GETTING THE DOOR. AND SO THAT'S- TO BE ABLE TO GROW WORK FORCE TRAIN THE RIGHT PEOPLE I'M A- FROM. FRUIT LIKE A PROGRAM INVESTED SHASTA COLLEGE THAT TRAINS- THAT TRAINS I HEAVY MACHINE OPERATORS- UNLESS YOU ARE PROGRAM LIKE THE CHIPS PROGRAMS I'M IN THIS YEAR AND THAT IS TRAINING- TRIED EIGHT DIFFERENT TRIBES. I'M IN WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT SO THAT THEY BECOME THE FUELS CREWS- THE IN IN THOSE COMMUNITIES AND THAT IS NOW EXPANDING. THE ABOUT. ALSO CREATE A BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT I GRANT AS WELL. SO THAT IT THE BUSINESS ISN'T QUITE RIGHT. FOR MORE ON THE BANKS. THEN THEY CAN. GO TO. TRIAL YOU TO GO TO HELP GETS. TO THEIR BUSINESS. STARTING A SMALL BUSINESS I'M THAT WERE WANTING TO MAKE SURE COVER AB ASPECT OF ENTIRE SO. INSURANCE DECENT BASS THAT YOU'RE ON THE- YOU TO LIVE FIRESTONE. ARE ALSO. BETTER STREAMLINE. TO REDUCE THE CARBON FOOTPRINT. ON THE CHOIR RECENTLY WHILE CREATING IT SUPPORTING MORAL ACCOUNT- BUT WHILE WE'RE DOING RESILIENCE. ECONOMICS BURGER KING BOB WE'VE GOT I BE ON THE ON THE CALL MISTER CALLUM OR- ADLER- TELL US I MEAN ONE OF THE THINGS THAT SEEMS TO BE ME FROM MINISTRY. IT MAY IT'S THERE WE JUST HAVEN'T HEARD ABOUT IT IS THESE TARGETS YOU KNOW ARE WE YOU KNOW WE HAVE SO MUCH LUMBER PRODUCTION RIGHT NOW OR WE COULD DOUBLE THAT. WE TRIPLING DEBT QUADRUPLING THAT BUT WHAT WE DOING WITH THE BIOMASS NUMBERS OF TARGETS BUT TELL SOMETHING ABOUT. THE GRANT PROGRAM WE KNOW THAT THE- PEOPLE CAN APPLY FOR A LOAN THAT'S THAT'S GREAT BUT SOME OF THESE FOLKS OTHER THAN THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND I KNOW THAT HASN'T REALLY LAUNCH BUT THESE BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT GRANTS. WHAT'S THIS IS ONLY THROUGH CAL FIRE OCCURS AT ALSO THROUGH THE AYE BANK. FOR KIDS GRANT PROGRAM IS THROUGH CAL FIRE AND- AND WE DO HAVE CAL FIRE ON THE CALL TODAY OR I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT IT- THE OUR COLLEAGUES THAT KOBE IS AND I CAN TELL YOU MORE ABOUT THE CLINIC CATALYST. AND ALSO THESE- FEEDSTOCK SUPPLY PROGRAMS I THINK ONE OF OUR GOALS IN THE ADMINISTRATION AT YOU KNOW ONE OF THE BOTTLENECKS THAT YOU JUST ARTICULATED IS THAT CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO IMPORT LUMBER WELL WE HAVE A GLUT IN THE ONE OF THE BIG BOTTLENECKS HAS BEEN MIL CAPACITY. AND SO- AND YET IF WE CAN INCREASE. THAT MILL CAPACITY FOR. WE HAVE A GRANTED THIS YEAR VATICAN. THAT STAB A SMALL MILL IN. CRESCENT MILLS FIVE MY FROM WALL FROM. WHAT FROM. ONLY DRIVING AT FIVE MILES TO CRESCENT MILLS AND THEN RETURNING IT TO GREEN BELT TO HELP YOU CAN FIND AND TO SUPPORT. THE RECONSTRUCTION OF THAT COMMUNITY AND AGAIN THAT MIL IS HELPING US IMPROVE OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT. SO THE I THINK IS REALLY HELPFUL IN EXPANDING THE CAPACITY HAPPY TO TURN. TO THEM- TO TALK ABOUT SORT OF HOW WE CAN EXPAND CAPITAL EQUIPMENT AND- IN CALIFORNIA CAN ANSWER OR I CAN ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. ABOUT THE- THE GRANT PROGRAM SPECIFICALLY. I THANK LISTA WHAT'S BECAUSE I'M SURE. I GOT A COUPLE OF MEMBERS ON THIS COMMITTEE THAT HAVE PLENTY OF- MILLS HAVE BEEN. NOT RUNNING A TO PASS. JUST CLOSE DOWN THERE THEY'VE BEEN SHUT DOWN FOR ME THE LEGACY. WE HAVE SO PLEASE ENLIGHTEN US. YES HI. GTECH EXACTLY DIRECTOR- SO WE'VE BEEN THE LAST MONTHS- UP THE COMIC. FIND THE FUNDS STATUTORY FOR THE PROBLEM WORSE BY THE ON SEPTEMBER THIRD. WAVES MEDIALLY SET UP A WEB PAGE TO RECEIVE POTENTIAL ENQUIRIES FINANCING OPPORTUNITIES- WE JUST AS A- SMART POINTED OUT WE JUST HAD OUR- KIND OF CATALYST FINANCING PLAN AS REQUIRED BY STATUTE. IN ADDITION TO THAT PROGRAMS FINANCING CRITERIA AT THE END OF JANUARY- WE STARTED DOING A MARKETING AN OUTREACH CAMPAIGN- AT THE END OF JANUARY. AND WE'RE JUST STARTING TO GO THROUGH INITIAL ENQUIRIES UP WHICH WE RECEIVED ABOUT FOR YOURSELF- AND- IN THAT I WOULDN'T SAY THAT THERE'S ANYTHING. IMMEDIATELY DISTINGUISHABLE ON. PROJECT SITES- THE- FOREST BIOMASS- IN THOSE BACK. THEIR SON AND- A DANCE MALES SPACE AND THERE'S A DIFFERENT CAT. IN WE'RE JUST. HAD A MEETING ON MONDAY TO WORK THREE. A AND START THOSE KIND. SO I THINK WE'RE AT THE STAGE OF DEALING WITH PROJECTS. IS AND- LENDERS IN THIS SPACE BECAUSE THAT DO YOU KNOW THAT THE ONE THING WE LIKE TO SEE FOR THE PROGRAM IS THAT WE- THAT WE CAN'T PROJECTS AND BUSINESSES THAT CAN SUCCESSFULLY REPAYING THEIR LOANS. SO THAT THE PROGRAM OF ALL IN ADDITION IT'S A GROUP POINTS TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS THAT THESE ARE BUSINESSES THAT ARE. VIABLE ECONOMICALLY FOR THEM TO PROVIDE CAPITAL TO AS. WELL GIVE US A BREAK DOWN OF THE THE FOR RESULT. YOU KNOW VIDAK WHAT IS IT IN YOU KNOW HYDROGEN CATALYST OR SOME OTHER THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS UNDER YOUR- IN IN THE AYE BANK THAT YOU GUYS ARE. POTENTIALLY COLLECTING GRANDSON WHICH IS HOW MUCH OF THAT IS JUST WHAT FOREST. FORESEE RELATED LOANS AND GRANTS. I'M I WAS SO I'D LIKE TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THE SPECIFIC SO OF THOSE FORTY ENQUIRIES THERE'S ABOUT TEN HIGHER PRIORITY ONES THAT WORK FOCUSING ON THEN THERE'S A BREAKDOWN WITHIN THEIR THAT SORT OF A SUBSET OF THOSE SO LET ME GET BACK TO YOU ON THE SPECIFICS. OKAY- LET'S GO TO. CENTER DOLLY HAS COUPLE QUESTIONS THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS AYE I'M GONNA TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF TIME THIS MORNING BECAUSE I WANT TO JUST. SHARE- TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF WORKING ON WE HAD THE DIXIE FIRE IN THE CALDOR FIRE WHICH WERE BOTH IN MY SENATE DISTRICT AND I WANT TO JUST GIVE YOU PERSPECTIVE TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO. I WAS ON WHAT THEY CALL THE QUINCY LIBRARY GROUP WHICH WAS A- IT WAS LOCAL ENVIRONMENTALIST IT WAS TO SENATOR DIANNE FEINSTEIN AND CONGRESSMAN WALLY HERGER DID A NET- FEDERAL. PIECE OF LEGISLATION TO DO- A PILOT PROJECT IN ON THAT LASSEN NATIONAL FOREST THE PLUMAS NATIONAL FOREST AND PART OF THIS YEAR BILL DISTRICT OF THE- FORCED. WE PASSED LEGISLATION FEDERALLY TO DO MOSAIC FIREBREAKS THROUGHOUT THE FOR SO THAT WE WOULD HAVE NO FIRES BIGGER THAN EIGHT THOUSAND ACRES AND WE GOT HELD UP IN COURT MOSTLY BY NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS STOPPING ARE PROJECTS THAT WE NEVER REALLY COMPLETED THAT. TWENTY FIVE YEARS LATER. THE WATERSHED HAS BURNED. THE DIXIE FIRE BURNED TREES THAT WERE FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY YEARS OLD ON THE COLLINS PINES PROPERTY. I ALSO SPENT SEVEN YEARS ON THIS YEAR IN ABOUT A CONSERVANCY BEFORE I CAME TO THE LEGISLATURE WORKING ON. MAKING MY- COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THIS YEAR AS FIRE RESILIENT SO. I JUST WANT TO LAY THAT OUT FOR YOU I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU- WHAT THE PROBLEM IS WE HAVE A WE HAVE A HUNDRED YEAR. POLICY ALMOST A HUNDRED YEAR OF. STOPPING FIRE IN THIS YEAR'S THAT'S NOT NATURAL THAT'S MILLION COST. ON TOP OF CLIMATE CHANGE SO WE HAVE A FORCED IT IS. COMPLETELY OVERGROWN I'M GONNA GIVE YOU I'M GONNA TRY TO. DRAW A PICTURE FOR YOU. DIDN'T THE LASSEN NATIONAL FOREST BURDEN GROWS TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION BOARD FEET EVERY YEAR. THEY HAVE THINNED OR CUT. LESS THAN TWENTY MILLION EIGHT TWENTY MILLION BOARD FEET. SO WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT FORCES CONTINUALLY GROWING ALL THE TIME AND IT'S STRESSING THE TREES WE HAVE BARK BEETLE ISSUES WE HAVE ALL THOSE ISSUES SO I WANT TO OUT THE PICTURE OF THE- SIZE OF THE- PROBLEM WE HAVE IN THIS YEAR'S. AND WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO HAVE FIRES LIKE THE DIXIE AND THE CALDOR. INTEL WE DO. MANAGEMENT NOW WHY CAN'T WE DO MANAGEMENT THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE TODAY IS MAINLY- PACIFIC INDUSTRIES AS A FEW. OTHER PRIVATE. THAT FACILITIES THAT DO MANUFACTURING OF LUMBER. WE'VE TRIED SO WE'VE LOST SEVERAL MAYBE FIFTY OR SIXTY BIOMASS STAND ALONE BIOMASS PLANTS THROUGHOUT THE SEARS AND THE REASON WE DON'T HAVE THOSE BIOMASS PLANTS TODAY IS BECAUSE- THEIR POWER PURCHASE AGREEMENTS. WERE NOT EXTENDED BY THE UTILITIES BECAUSE THEY CAN GET SOLAR AND WIND AT A CHEAPER RATE FOR RENEWABLESSO I HAVE POWER PLANTS SITTING IN CHESTER I HAVEN'T I USED TO HAVE AN ALL OUT THROUGHOUT THE DISTRICT THAT ARE NOT RUNNING SOME OF THOSE ARE TRYING TO BE RE PERMITTED. TO COME BACK ONLINE. SO THERE'S PLENTY OF MATERIAL OUT THERE BUT NO PLACE TO TAKE IT. AND SO WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH ALL THE MONEY THAT YOU THIS LAID OUT WITH HIGH BANK THE REASON WE HAVE TO HAVE AYE BECAUSE BECAUSE A PRIVATE LENDER WILL NOT LAND. AND YOU WANT TO THE REASON WHY IS BECAUSE WE HAVE TO HAVE A CONTINUOUS SUPPLY OF MATERIAL. TO DO THE BUSINESS MODEL. NOW TO MY QUESTIONS. I WANT TO ASK THE SECRETARY AND I WANT TO PREFACE THIS WAS SAYING THIS IS TOUGH THIS IS NOT EASY TO DO BECAUSE WE HAVE TO AGENCIES. MANAGING THE LANDSCAPE NUMBER ONE THE LARGEST AGENCY IS THE FEDERAL FOR SERVICE. NUMBER TWO IS YOUR DEPARTMENT AND THE SECRETARY RESOURCES FOR THE REST OF IT. SO MY QUESTION IS. HOW ARE WE GOING TO GET THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO WORK WITH US DID MANAGE THESE TO GET THE INFRASTRUCTURE WE NEED NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO SO THAT WE CAN TAKE CARE. OF A- THE- PRODUCT IS COMING OUT- SO I THIS IS A POLICY QUESTION BECAUSE WE CAN THROW MONEY AT IT ALL DAY. AND IT'S NOT GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM UNTIL WE GET THE POLICIES. OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THE STATE ON THE SAME PAGE SO THAT'S MY FIRST pSENATOR AND I REALLY RESPECT HIM SETTING THE CONTACT THEM I THINK I'D SAY I LARGELY AGREE WITH WITH THE WAY THAT YOU FRAME IT WHICH IS WE HAVE TO GET MORE MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES ACTIVELY MANAGING OUR LANDSCAPES AND TALK THROUGH YOU KNOW A RANGE OF DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES INCLUDING YOU KNOW RESTORING. A PRESCRIBED BY A- AND YOU KNOW UNTIL WE SCALE UP. CATASTROPHIC FIRE REST YOU KNOW REMAINS REALLY HIGH- YOU HEARD JACK MISS MORRIS TALK TECHNIQUE SECRETARY MORRIS TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW SOME OF THE WORK WE'RE DOING TRYING TO REVITALIZE THE FOREST DR- AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BUT YOU ALSO POINT OUT THAT WE NEED THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AS AN ACTIVE PARTNER. AND AS AS I POINTED OUT NEW POINTED OUT 57% OF OUR FOREST LANDS OWNED AND MANAGED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND IF THEY'RE NOT PRESENT AND WORKING WITHOUT THAT AND WERE REALLY. HOLDEN MAKING A- I THINK GOOD NEWS IS THAT THE USDA THAT DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE THE FEDERAL AGENCY OVERSEEING THE U. S. FOREST SERVICE YOU KNOW UNVEILED ABOUT A MONTH AGO I'M A PRETTY PRETTY AGGRESSIVE PLAN TO ACTIVELY ACTIVELY MANAGED BELIEVE TWENTY MILLION ACRES OF NATIONAL FORESTS ACROSS THE WEST IMPROVE FUNDING- OR THAT. AIMS TO BE SEEN HOW MUCH FUNDING COMES TO CALIFORNIA WE'RE CERTAINLY WORKING WITH THE REGIONAL FORESTER AND REGION FIVE- AND ALL OF THE REASON FOR ON THAT ON THAT QUESTION AND THEN SPECIFICALLY HOW DOES THE WORK GETS DONE. YEAH YOU KNOW SOME OF IT HAS TO BE DONE AND THE TYPE OF GRANT THAT WE'RE GETTING OUT OF WORK BUT WE NEED TO REVITALIZE THE ECONOMIC ACTIVITY. DATEABLE YOU CAN ACT. THAT BRING YOU KNOW THAT- DEATH MEDITATION OUT OF THE POOREST BUDGET TO PUT INTO EFFECTIVE YOU KNOW AND FRANKLY. ON THE ON GOING FOREST MANAGEMENT THAT HAVE BEEN PLAYING. SO I'M NOT GOING TO SIT HERE AND TELL YOU THAT YOU KNOW. ANOTHER MESSAGE OR CALL IT OR YOU KNOW THAT THAT THAT YOU KNOW THE SOLUTION AND YOU KNOW- RIGHT BEFORE US BUT WE ARE MAKING PROGRESS AND- WE GOT THIS MILLION ACRE ALL OF MY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE ALTERNATELY I THINK WHAT FROM YOUR BILL I'M NOT IN FUTURE YEARS. OUR OUR FOCUS IS REALLY SCALING UP TO HIT THAT GOAL. IN THE NEXT FEW. YEARS AND THEN MOVE ON FROM THERE. WELL I WANT TO JUST FOLLOW UP WAS SAYING. I KNOW THAT SENATOR FEINSTEIN I WORK WITH ARE PERSONALLY UNDERSTAND THIS ISSUE AND IT TO ME THIS IS ABOUT THE ADMINISTRATION'S. CALIFORNIA ADMINISTRATION THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND THE BITE ADMINISTRATION GETTING TOGETHER AND FIGURING OUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS BECAUSE IT AT THE END THE DAY. HI I WAS ON THE DIXIE AND I WAS ON THE CALDOR FIRES WHILE THEY WERE BURNING AND THE COORDINATION BETWEEN THE FOREST SERVICE AND CAL FIRE. IS NONEXISTENT. AND I'M I HATE TO BRING THIS UP IS TO FAX THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS THE TWO AGENCIES. BY FIRE TOTALLY DIFFERENT. AND WHAT'S THE WHAT'S LOSING IS THE PUBLIC AND ARE WERE EMITTING CARBON WE'RE ROOTING OUR WATERSHEDS AND WE I'M ASKING FOR LEADERSHIP. AS YOU'RE IN THE POSITION TO BE ABLE TO GO TO ADMINISTRATION. AT THE STATE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND GET SOME POLICIES PUT IN PLACE AND IT'S GONNA HAPPEN SO I'M I'M BEGGING YOU FOR THAT BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY LET ME GIVE EXAMPLE THE LAB OF FIRE WHICH WAS IN SISKIYOU COUNTY WAS A SINGLE. LIGHTNING STRIKE THREE. THAT THE POOR SERVICE PUT A LINE AROUND DIDN'T COMPLETELY EXTINGUISH IT LEFT. AND THE WIND BLEW THE TREE OVER AND IT AND THEN CALIFORNICUM RESPOND BECAUSE WE HAD. WE LOST WE LOST HOMES. BECAUSE THAT POLICY. I WANT TO COST RIGHT NOW IS SO BAD. IT'S THAT'S GOTTA STOP AND AYE AYE LOOK. I'M NOT HERE THROWING ROCKS I'M LOOKING FOR SOLUTIONS BUT I'M SURE I'M POINTING OUT THE PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE. THAT CANNOT CONTINUE IN THE WILL THE FIRE WAS THE SAME WAY IT BURKE FOR FOUR DAYS BEFORE THE FOR SERVICE RESPONDED TO IT. WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO SEE MILLION ACRE FIRES. UNTIL WE START EXTINCTION AND I KNOW IT'S TOO COLD YOU HAVE TO. GET TO FIGHT FIRE. AT THE SAME TIME YOU HAVE TO PREVENT. DO DO MADE AS WE ARE HUNDRED YEARS BEHIND. SO I JUST WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU. THAT THE FOR SERVICE COUNTS TREATED ACRES AS ACRES BURNED. THAT MEANS IF A WILDFIRE CAME AND DESTROYED IT THEY COUNT THAT IS TREATED. THAT'S THE WRONG POLICY DISTRICT ARE NOT TREATED THAT'S DESTROYED. TREATED ACRE SHOULD BE. ACRES THAT WE'VE ACTUALLY THE END. AND- AND FIRE CAN THEN GO BACK INTO THOSE ACRES. SO THE LAST. BUT THOSE ARE JUST STATEMENTS AND I'M HERE TO WORK ALONGSIDE YOU I'VE BEEN IN THIS GAME FOR A LONG TIME AND I CAN'T. STAND TO WATCH OR FORCED CONTINUE TO BURN BECAUSE WE CAN'T GET ALONG WITH THE FOR SERVICE AND THEY NEED TO BE AT THE TABLE. SO THE LAST QUESTION I HAVE AND YOU CAN I KNOW THIS. INFORMATION YOU PROBABLY WON'T HAVE AS I'D LIKE TO KNOW. FROM LAST YEAR. HOW MANY ACRES WE TREATED. ACTUALLY TREATED. HOW MUCH COST WAS A PER ACRE. AND I WANT TO SAY IN CLOSING. YOUR DOOR'S BEEN OPENED I'M NOT A THIS IS NOT. IS NOT PERSONAL THIS IS JUST FRUSTRATION COMING OUT BECAUSE WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT. CAN NOT. CONTINUE TO HAVE MILLION ACRE FIRES AND THERE'S NO REASON FOR THE ONLY REASON FIRED IN GOING TO THE TAHOE BASIN AND COMPLETELY WIPE OUT TODD WAS BECAUSE WE HAD A FUEL BREAK THERE. AND YOU KNOW BECAUSE YOU ON THE GROUND THERE. LOOKING AT IT WE NEED MORE OF THOSE AND WE NEED TO DO IT. SOONER THAN LATER THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE YOUR ENGAGEMENT AND REALLY WANT TO THANK YOU FOR. STAYING ENGAGED OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS ON THESE. ON THESE TOUGH QUESTIONS. NO DOUBT ABOUT IT THAT THE- CONDITIONS ARE GETTING WORSE AND I. AND I OPENED UP. CALDERON THE DIXIE THAT YOU MENTION YOU'RE OFF ON. YOUR DID SOMETHING THAT NO OTHER FIRES DOWN A HUNDRED SEVENTY YEARS ACROSS STUDENTS HEARING ABOUT A SUMMIT. WHICH IS YOU KNOW LARGELY GRANTED. BECAUSE OF THE INTENSITY OF THOSE FIRES. I DO THINK ARE ARE OUR INTERVENTIONS ARE GETTING BETTER MEANING YOU KNOW THAT THE FUNDING THAT YOU ARE CHAMPIONING. I GOVERNOR'S CHAMPING ARE BEING PUT TO WORK- REDUCED HOURS SHOPPING WHILE PIRATES BUT WE CLEARLY NEED TO DO A LOT MORE. WE ARE TRACKING AND THE FISCAL YEAR BASIS- THE NUMBER OF ACRES TREATED- BY OUR STATE DEPARTMENT. BOB BUTTERS CAL FIRE AND THE SO CAL FIRE YOU KNOW PART WAY THROUGH THE FISCAL YEAR NOW BUT BY THE END OF FISCAL YEAR THEY'LL HAVE THE FIGURES FOR CAL FIRE. I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THOUGH. I WANT CAL BUYERS ARE LOOKING. OF OUR AFTER FORESTRY. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THE SCALE WE NEED TO KNOW WE BROUGHT IT'S SORT OF A WHOLE OF GOVERNMENT APPROACH SO WE NEED TO ACTUALLY INCLUDE. FOR EXAMPLE YOU MENTIONED THIS YEAR AND ABOUT A CONSERVANCY TO TAHOE CONSERVANCY TO COASTAL ARE DFW. ABOUT YOU KNOW ALL OF OUR PARTNERS INCLUDING A RESOURCE CONSERVATION DISTRICT SO. YOU KNOW WHAT WE NEED TO DO HERE IN THE NEXT YEAR AS I MENTIONED AGAINST BRING. ALL OF THE PROJECT THAT ARE BENEFITING WILDFIRE RESILIENCE AND PUT THEM IN ONE YOU KNOW ACCOUNTABLE. THAT PLATFORM TO MEASURE. THAT WE CAN REALLY ACHIEVE THAT SCALE THAT WE'RE FOCUSED ON- BUT- BUT LOOK POINTPOINT TAKEN IN TERMS OF THE URGENCY IN THE FOCUS THAT WE NEED BECAUSE WHILE I. I CAN HONESTLY SAY THAT I'M I'M PROUD. OF THE WORK WE'VE DONE AND THE IMPROVEMENT. AND ARE GETTING WORSE IN WE HAVE A LOT. OF AHEAD OF- YES. LAST SAY THAT- YOU KNOW LAST YEAR I THE PROC FOR THAT- DID NOT GET FUNDED THAT WE'RE SEQUEL READY PROJECTS AT THROUGHOUT MY DISK IS ROCK CALIFORNIA WITH THE RCTS IN A FIRE SAFE COUNCILS- I. DO REALLY BELIEVE IN THE CITY LEASES HERE BACK IN SERVICE HE BECAUSE I SAT ON IT FOR SEVEN YEARS THEY DO A GREAT JOB AND THEY THEY CAN GET THAT MONEY OUT WE NEED TO JUST. FRONT LOAD THEM AND LET HIM GO TO THE PROJECTS ARE ALREADY SEQUEL READY PROOF PROJECTS. AND YOU KNOW TOM PORTER LAST YEAR SAID THEY COULDN'T GET THE MONEY OUT THE DOOR FAST ENOUGH OR NOT. MY WHOLE LIFE I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR MONEY. TO DO PROJECTS AND NOW WE GOT MONEY WE CAN'T GET IT DONE SO THERE'S OTHER AVENUES I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THAT MONEY GO. TO THOSE AGENCIES THAT CAN THAT DEL ALONG WITH CAL FIRE BUT THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT ARE READY. TO DO AND HOW THE CONTRACTORS IN PLACE TO DO IT. THANK YOU. WE WILL CERTAINLY MISS CHIEF PORTER. WHO WAS A FORCE FOR FIRST. AND HE DID HIS JOB AS FIREFIGHTER CENTER MCGUIRE. IF SOME QUESTIONS. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND I THINK IT'S JUST- IT'S GONNA DO A COMMENT HERE IN IN THAT'S ON THE ISSUE OF BIOMASS LOOK- YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE NORTH COAST. IN WHAT WE CAN DO WITH BIOMASS AND IN PARTICULAR. WHERE A DEPUTY SECRETARY AND I'M O GRATEFUL FOR THE DEPUTY SECRETARY'S LEADERSHIP. ON THIS ISSUE SHE COMES FROM VERY SIMILAR REGION- EAST OF US AS WE LOOK AT IN REGARDS TO. THAT HERE ON THE NORTH COAST BUT- THERE'S TWO ISSUES ON WHY BROWN AT BINANCE IS NOT WORKING IN THE STATE. NUMBER ONE. BUT WE DO NOT GIVE ASSURANCES. TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO A BIOMASS PLANT THAT THAT ELECTRICITY IS GOING TO BE PURCHASED. AND IF WE ARE SERIOUS ABOUT. MAKING OUR FORESTS MORE FIRE SAFE WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A RECIPROCAL. TO THAT STOCK THAT IS IN THE FOREST. SECOND ISSUE ON WHY VIOLENCE IS NOT AS SUCCESSFUL AS IT COULD BE IN THE STATE IS TRUCKING COSTS WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THESE BIOMASS POWER PLANTS LOCATED NEAR WHERE THIS WORK IS HAPPENING AND IT'S NOT HAPPENING AT THE OMENT SO I'M ALL FOR TAKING A LOOK AT INNOVATIVE WAYS THAT WE CAN- USE DOLLARS ON. FOR TIMBER BUT I'D ACTUALLY LIKE TO GET BACK TO THE BRASS TACKS OF IT NUMBER ONE WE HAVE BIOMASS PLANTS ARE ON THE NORTH COAST IN CENTER DOLLARS DISTRICT BY THAT COULD EXPAND WE HAVE INDIVIDUALS WHO WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN EXPAND BIOMASS IN NON IMPACTED AIR BASINS I MIGHT ADD AS WELL. YET WE ARE NOT A GUARANTEE COSTS FOR A MEGAWATT HOUR IN NUMBER TWO TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET IS NOT GOING TO CUT IT WHEN IT COMES TO TRUCKING COSTS SO I THINK THAT'S THE OTHER PIECE AND I KNOW THAT BY THE CHAIR IS VERY FOCUSING ON THAT I JUST WANTED TO MAKE THAT COMMENT. CAN WE HAVE A RESPONSE FROM THE ADMINISTRATION AND CAN YOU EXPAND ON THE BIOMASS FACILITIES THAT ARE DISTINCT ME TO PRODUCE ELECTRICITY AND WHAT IT WOULD TAKE IT'S AN INVESTMENT TO ALLOW THEM TO MAKE. UP FUEL IF THAT WORKS IF THAT WERE MORE DESIRABLE OR SOME COMBINATION THERE OF WITH THE. WITH THAT- PRODUCT THAT COMES IN. YEAH I WOULD THINK BROUGH SPEAKING. WE KNOW WE NEED MORE SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC ACTIVITY ZERO ONE ONE DEATH PRESENTATION OUT OF THE FOURTH. YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT REMARKABLE FUNDING WILL NEVER HAD BEFORE THANKS IN LARGE PART TO YOU ALL WHO ARE YOU KNOW MEETING THIS HEARING TODAY BUT WE KNOW THERE NEEDS TO BE PRIVATE INVESTMENT IN BEEN REMOVING THE VEGETATION AND ECOLOGICALLY SUSTAINABLE WAY. AND WHILE WE ARE REALLY BULLISH ON NOON WHEN PRODUCTS LIKE THIS MASK JIM BURKE CROP LAMINATED TIMBER- WE RECOGNIZE YOU KNOW THE POINTS YOU MAKE WHICH AND BIOMASS. YOU KNOW- THE FACILITY EXIST TODAY ACTUALLY UTILIZE THAT- UTILIZED THAT. EDUCATION I THINK CENTER DOLLY YOU KNOW HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD THERE'S ATTENTION WHICH IS. YOU KNOW SORT OF THE SOBRE LINING RENEWABLE ARE BECOMING SO INEXPENSIVE LIKE SOLAR AND WIND IT IS- BIOMASS IT MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE- TO GENERATE ENERGY THAN THOSE CLEAN FORMS OF ENERGY. AND THAT THEY'RE YOU KNOW PPA IS FROM WE HEAR FROM THE UTILITIES THAT- ARE EXPENSIVE AND LEAD TO INCREASE IN IN CONSUMER ELECTRIC ELECTRICAL REYES. SO I THINK I RECOGNIZE THAT FILE MATH PLANTS YOU KNOW WHAT CLAIRE MORTON ROLLED YOU KNOW I THINK THAT SPEAKS DOT COM AT THE SAME TIME THE CHALLENGES- EXACERBATING RATE INCREASES AND IN SOME PLACES YOU KNOW USING LEGACY TECHNOLOGIES GRADING CARE POLLUTION. SO I THINK YOU KNOW WHAT I'LL SAY SENATORS IN THIS IS A POINT WELL TAKEN WHICH WHAT I HEAR FROM YOU AT ALL IS YOU KNOW. TO REALLY UNDERSTAND THE ADMINISTRATION POSITION I MEAN YOU KNOW I THINK THE BEST THING BIOMASS PLANTS AND FINDING A WAY TO ENABLE THEM TO OPERATE- YEAH YOU KNOW CREATING MANIFESTO. THIS OUT OF THE FOUR WE DO THE- WILDFIRE. TO ALLOW I'LL TAKE THAT THAT THAT. AS. YOU KNOW IMPORT. POINT FROM YOU ALL- BACK TO MY COLLEAGUES PROSTATE TO THE HAVE YOU NOTICED JUST A FOR OUR THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC EACH CAN AND OTHERS. ALSO ADAM THAT AND THAT IF YOU AT OUR STRATEGY OR HOW DO SHOULD MOVED MACHINE. OUT OF THE COURT IN A CON- IT'S ALMOST REFRESHING ARE TECH AGNOSTIC IN CURRENTLY WHAT YOU WITH TREAT AS TECHNOLOGY. RIGHT PART OF THAT TREAT COULD POTENTIALLY GO TO LUMBER ARE THE TOP OF THE TREE COULD GO TO BIOMASS PART OF THREE CAN GO TO PARTICLE BOARD. AND SO BECAUSE THERE'S MULTIPLE USES FOR THE WORD EVEN IN A SINGLE TREE THAT YOU'RE REMOVING WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT WE ARE. THAT WE ARE CREATING A FOUNDATION FOR THAT ENTIRE ECONOMY AND THE BEST USED TO BE ABLE TO MOVE AND SO WHETHER THAT'S A CRIME A% CATALYST. OUR BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT LOANS THIS OUTRAGE PETITIONS SUBSIDIES TO GET THAT MOVING OR THE FEEDSTOCK SUPPLY GUARANTEES WE'RE TRYING TO CREATE STABILITY CONFIDENCE AND ACCESS TO CAPITAL IN THE MARKET. SO THAT THE ECONOMY CAN HELP DRIVE THAT AND YOU'RE YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY- THAT AND SO I HOPE THAT WHAT YOU'RE HEARING FROM US IS THAT WE'RE SUPPORTIVE OF ALL OF THE TECHNOLOGIES THAT I AM TRYING TO FACILITATE AND EXPAND ALL OF THE TECHNOLOGIES. THAT CAN USE THAT MATERIAL AS OPPOSED TO TRYING TO CREATE ONE SILVER BULLET OR DRAG THE FORCED AN ECONOMY IN ONE QUESTION- AND YOU KNOW WHEN YOU LOOK AT AND YOUR POINT YOU KNOW WIRE SOME OF THESE. AND THE BIOMASS FACILITIES ARE EXISTING FACILITIES. THAT CAN. ALLERGY THAT. OUR ARMED. YOU KNOW AND WHEN WE'RE TO GET A LOOK SORT OF CASE STUDIES THE ONE TO DISTILLATE AND SENATOR DOLLARS. WHICH A WOULD BE. IS OF. THAT- A YEAR AND- YOU KNOW AND IT'S VALLEY OR TO. COMMUNITY THAT WOULD PULLING- AND SPELL. YOUR EXPLORE IT AND I'M- WHERE. HERE'S OUR- IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT US ACROSS THE TIME. IN THIS. SAN MCGUIRE THANK YOU I'LL BE INDEED HERE'S MY BOTTOM LINE DOLLARS TRANSFER SAID IN THIS BY IT'S GOING TO GO VERY FAR TO PILOT IS BY PROJECT IS BEYOND ABOUT IT. IF WE'RE LOOKING AT. WHETHER A IS ON THE NEW CO OR IN NORTHEAST. WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE PUTTING THE GOOD IN FRONT OF THE PURE. AND WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS THIS- TO BE ABLE TO MOVE INTO FEDERAL FORCE QUICKLY. IN PARTICULAR WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE. AN AREA IN WHICH WE CAN GET RID OF ALL OF THAT ALL THAT SLASH IT'S COMING FROM THE FORCE. TO BE TO DO THAT THE PATH OF LEAST RESISTANCE IN NON IMPACTED THEIR BUSINESS I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE CENTER VALLEY IT'S BOUNOUS- SO WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THIS IS THAT. THE BILL TO GET THIS ACROSS THE STATE WE NEED TO GUARANTEED COST OF ELECTRICITY AND WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO HELP SUBSIDIZE THE COST OF TRANSPORTATION THE LAST THING I'LL SAY WE'VE HEARD THIRTY BILLION IN INSURED LOSSES BETWEEN THE 200-017-2000 EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY TWENTY FIVE SEASON THIRTY BILLION INSURED LOSSES. WERE LOSING MILLIONS UPON MILLIONS OF ACRES OF PRIME FOR. IN WATERSHEDS EVERY YEAR ACROSS THE WEST PALM WE HAVE TO TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT AND EVEN IF IT IS FOR THE NEXT DECADE WHEN WE WORKING WITH OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS A AN AREA. IN WHICH A FACILITY IN WHICH WE CAN TAKE ALL OF THE STOCK OUT OF THE FORCE TO AND BE ABLE TO HAVE A CLEANER GREENER ENERGY I WOULD SAY WE NEED TO SERIOUSLY LOOK. AT EXPANSION OF BIOMASS IN NON IMPACTED AIR BASE IN SAID I WOULD OPE THAT COULD BE ON THE TABLE HERE- THIS YEAR QUICK QUESTION I WANT TO JUST ADD ON TO. THE SENATE REQUIRES COMMENTS. COUPLE THINGS NUMBER ONE. WE NEED TO OUR CHIP CONTRACTS ARE LONG TERM CONTRACT FROM THE FOR SERVICE SO THAT THESE PLANTS HAVE A- STREAMLINED WE WON'T WE DON'T NEED TO SUBSIDIZE THEM. IF YOU TO BUILD A MORE RE RE ENTER AT. TAKE THE NEW ONE OF THE OLD ONES BACK ONLINE. IF THERE'S A CONFLICT THAT PPA CONTRACT. YOU HAVE TO TOTAL FIVE PERMITS ARE PROBLEM ON THE LOOK I'VE I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THE WEST WOULD PLAN AND THE LOYALTY PLAN LOYALTON. PLANT HAS IS GOING TO SERVE THE TAHOE BASIN WHICH DESPERATELY NEEDS SERVED BUT I CAN'T GET A PPA. POWER PURCHASE AGREEMENT SO THAT'S WHERE THE ADMINISTRATION CAN COME IN AND HELP. LOOK YOU TALK ABOUT WIND AND SOLAR IS CHEAPER GREEN ENERGY BUT THE PUBLIC BENEFIT TO DO BIOMASS IS THE- STOPS THESE CATASTROPHIC FIRES IT HELPS WILDLIFE HELPS OUR WATERSHED. THE PUBLIC BENEFIT IS WAVING A BIGGER BENEFIT THE COST MAY BE MORE ON ELECTRICITY SIDE BUT THE PUBLIC BENEFIT THIS IS. ENORMOUSLY BETTER THAN WIND AND SOLAR AND THAT NEEDS TO BE TAKEN INTO THE CALCULATION. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT- PERMITTING THESE PLANTS IT'S THE PERMITTING PROCESS AND THE PPAS THAT NEED TO BE AND WHAT SUPPLY. THOSE ARE ALL THINGS LOOK. SERVICES BECAUSE IT HAS CAN'T TAKE ANYMORE LAWMAKERS ARE CUTTING THEIR CUTTING ALL THE DEAD TREES THAT THEY HAVE ON THEIR OWN LAND THAT'S THE THAT'S THE ISSUE TODAY. WE CAN MAKE WOULD OUT OF WE CAN MAKE BOARDS AND WE CAN MAKE BY MASS AT THE SAME TIME WE HAVE TO HAVE A STEADY SUPPLY. TO THESE PLANS WHEN THEY'RE PLACED. CAN CAN RUN FOR FORTY YEARS SO THEY CAN GET BACK THEIR INVESTMENT. THAT'S THE ISSUES. AND THAT'S IT'S GOOD COMMONSENSE APPROACH WE'VE GOT TO GET THAT REGULATORY PEOPLE OUT OF THE WAY. GET CONTRACTS AND THEN GO FOR PUTTING TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN THERE FOR HAULING IS GONNA DO. KEEP IN THE A FEW THAT ARE OUT THERE RUNNING BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO. TAKE CARE OF THE LONG TERM- PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE WHICH IS A HUNDRED YEARS OF FIRE SUPPRESSION AND CLIMATE CHANGE. VERY GOOD POINT. CENTER STERN HAVE QUESTION. YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- AND I APPRECIATE DISCUSSION. SO FOR- WHEN. WHEN PARADISE WAS BURNING DOWN- YOU KNOW WE WERE HURT AND WITH THOSE COMMUNITIES IS MY HOME TOWN BURNED DOWN TO MIGHT BE LOST EVERYTHING AND WE'LL SEE- SO I DON'T NEED TO REHASH ALL THAT- HOWEVER MAKES AMERICA CUSTER CRY- BUT- OMITTED JUST DIG IN THE- DETAILS HERE IN AND START OUT BY THANKING THE ADMINISTRATION BECAUSE- WERE. WE WANT TO GO BIGGER WE WANT MORE CUTIE WITH OUR STRATEGIES IN DIFFERENT REGIONS AND BUT I KNOW YOU YOU ARE PUTTING YOUR SHOULDER TO THE WHEEL AND YOU HAVE BEEN THERE FOR US AND I JUST I APPRECIATE THAT WORK- I'M GONNA GO BACK TO MY- SAME BEATING OF THE DRUM AS THE LOAN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ON. THIS COMMITTEE- I DIDN'T BURN DOWN OUR HOMES IN WOLSEY OR TOM IS YOUR SADDLE READ YOUR- RIDE- EMBERS DID- WE HAVE A- WIND DRIVEN FIRE DYNAMIC WERE IN OAK WOODLANDS AND CHAPARRAL- IT'S ABOUT WIND SPEED AND GRASSLANDS AND- LITTLE BIT TO MECHON VENTS AND GUTTERS AND- AND THEN PEOPLE NOT INSULATING THEIR GARAGES YOU KNOW. IT'S ALL THE SMALL THINGS IS NOT IT'S NOT ABOUT ACREAGE ABOUT PEOPLE IN OUR AREA AND I'M I KNOW WE DID TO HAVE TO NEGOTIATIONS DOWN THE HOME STRETCH AT THE END OF THE YEAR LAST YEAR- THEN WE END. THE GOVERNOR SIGNED MY BILL SB SIXTY THREE AS WELL- AND IN THE TRAILER THAT WE AUTHORIZED- FOR THIS CURRENT APPROPRIATION AROUND FIRE PREVENTION FUNDING- I THINK THE LANGUAGE SAYS- THAT TO THE FUNDING SHALL BE AWARDED IN A WAY THAT PRIORITIZES PROJECTS TO PROTECT A LARGER POPULATION BASE. OR NUMBER OF STRUCTURES RELATIVE TO THE SIZE OF THE GRANT- AT THAT CALIFORNIA BI&lt;c.cyan&gt; OP CONDUCTING OUTREACH- IN&lt;/c&gt; AREAS OF THE STATE THAT HAVE HAD HISTORIC HAVE HAVE HIS. WE HAD A LOW APPLICATION OR PARTICIPATION RATE. IN THE FIRE PREVENTION GRANTS PROGRAM- AND THAT BY FEBRUARY FIRST WE WERE GOING TO HAV. A REPORT FROM CAL FIRE- THE LEGISLATURE BY COUNTY ON THE NUMBER ONE DOLLAR OF APPLICATIONS RECEIVING GRANTS AWARDED SO- YOU KNOW THAT THAT DISPARITY OVER TIME AND THE DIFFICULTY OF PREVENTING FIRE. IN THESE NOT JUST SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AREAS BUT THESE SORT OF MORE DENSELY POPULATED REGIONS THAT DON'T HAVE THE SAME FORESTRY CHALLENGES BUT- HAVE MUCH MORE SORT OF COMPLEX IN THE WEEDS CHALLENGES ARE IN THE GRASS CHALLENGES IF YOU WILL COULD BE IN THE BERKELEY HILLS ARE IN ALAMEDA- COULD BE RIVERSIDE COUNTY YOUR SAMBAR TO DINO WE'RE DOWN IN ORANGE COUNTY- BUT I ONLY. YOU KNOW I SEE- A DROP OFF IN THE- PROPOSAL FOR. FIRE PREVENTION ROGIC FUNDING AND FROM THE ANALYSIS I GOT FROM MY STAFF EVEN FOR THE FORTY MILLION WE DID LAST YEAR- THERE'S STILL A PRETTY DRAMATIC DISPARITY- WHERE WORST YOU'RE SCRAPPING OVER FORTY MILLION DOLLARS NOW MAYBE TALK ABOUT TWENTY. CAN CAN YOU AWAY IN JUST ON. HOW THE EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN SINCE LAST YEAR AND- WHAT THAT OUT REACHES LOOK LIGHT AND IF THAT REPORT IS BEEN. GIVEN THE LEGISLATURE RIGHT RIGHT YET I APOLOGIZE IF I HAVEN'T READ IT. BUT IN IN WE WOULD LIKE TO COMMENT SINCE WE ULLED ISSUE TO ON THE TASK FORCE REPORT IT WOULD BE INAPPROPRIATE TO DISCUSS THAT THE FIRST TIME. DIFFERENT PORTS SORRY RIGHT NOT NOT TASK FORCE REPORT I'M LOOKING FOR WE'LL GET INTO THAT ONE THIS IS THE RIVER THAT ON FIRE BRIDGES THAT WE'LL DISCUSS THE DIFFERENT TIME YET STILL DON'T QUITE BUT JUST GENERALLY ON. THE REPORT YEAH NOT TASK FORCE SORRY JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR NOT NOT ON TASK FORCE REPORT ON THE THIS IS TRAILER LANGUAGE ON THE FIRE PREVENTION. GRANTS PROGRAM AND THE HISTORIC DISPARITY AND LACK OF PRIORITY FOR FIRE THREATEN COMMUNITIES. FOR YOUR QUESTION SENATOR STERN- AND- I. I WILL CHECK IN ON THAT REPORT WITH CAL FIRE- I KNOW IT'S BEEN DRAFTED AND WE'LL SEE. WHERE IT IS IN TERMS OF BEING TRANSMITTED- AND- I AND I CAN'T GIVE YOU JUST A BREAKDOWN IN TERMS OF THE FIRE PREVENTION GRANT FUNDING. FROM LAST YEAR AND AGAIN REMEMBER THAT THE- AND OF GRANTS FROM THE SEPTEMBER APPROPRIATION JUST CLOSED FOR THE FIRE AYE PREVENTION GRANTS TO THOSE ARE- IN PROCESS SO. I LOOKING AT THE EARLY ACTION DOLLARS FOR FIRE PREVENTION- GRANT- SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA- WAS GIVEN SIXTY FOUR GRANT AWARDS TOTALING SIXTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS. AND THE NORTHERN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WHAT IS AWARDED FORTY AWARDS TOTALING SEVENTY POINT FOUR DOLLARS. AND THEN ALSO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS REALLY INTERESTING ABOUT LAST YEAR THAT WE'RE CALLING IN THE BUDGET GOING FORWARD. IS THAT- ARE CONSERVANCY'S WHICH ARE ENCOURAGED FOR THE REGIONAL FORCED EMPIRE CAPACITY PROGRAMS THEY DELIVER ALSO GRANT DOLLARS- ACROSS ADD THOSE RESILIENCE SPECTRUM'S. CHU NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SO NORTHERN CALIFORNIA CONCERT YOU DOLLARS HUNDRED FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THE BUDGET LAST YEAR SENATE CAL. UNDER EIGHTEEN DOLLARS UP. LAST YEAR FOR PROGRAM THAT DELAY FIRE SOME OF THE CONCERNS- DOLLARS I AM. I SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SO FOR EXAMPLE I JUST DIEGO. I THEY'RE DOLLARS WHAT YOU'RE INTO THE FIGHT PREVENTION PRO. I'M A STAFF THROUGH THE RE FORCE BUYER PROGRAMS AIMED BY THE DIEGO CONSERVATION DISTRICT THAT WENT INTO. THE HOME DEFENSIBLE SPACE TRIPPING PROGRAMS THAT SECRETARY CROWFOOT MENTIONED IT I HAVE PURCHASED A FIRE ENGINE FOR EXAMPLE OR A LOCAL TRIBE- THE AND INVESTED IN STRATEGIC FUEL BREAKS AROUND THAT COMMUNITY SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE CONSERVANCY DOLLARS. ARE BEING DRIVEN BASED ON THE REGIONAL NEEDS WHICH SOMETIMES ARE GOING TO BE ON THE LANDSCAPE SOMETIMES ARE GOING TO BE IN THE COMMUNITIES. AND. ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS I WANT TO ROLL OUT. TOWARD YOUR BROADER. ABOUT WHAT ARE WE DOING ABOUT REALLY SCALING HOME HARDENING INDEFENSIBLE SPACE- I HAVE MY COLLEAGUES FROM CAL FIRE HELLO YES ON THE LINE TO TALK ABOUT SORT OF THE PILOT PROGRAM IS THE FIRST TIME WE'VE REALLY ROLLED OUT. A DIRECT INTERVENTION TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT- LOWER INCOME CALIFORNIANS I TRIED TO GET SORT OF A SATURATION LEVEL IN COMMUNITIES. A NEW INITIATIVE LIKE HEALTHCARE- I'M AND THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE HELLO YES JUST ROLLED OUT LAST WEEK IS A PROGRAM THAT CREATES SPECIFIC STANDARDS FOR INSURANCE COMPANIES TO BE ABLE TO WORLD WAR HOMEOWNERS. ARE PUTTING IN THE DEFENSIBLE SPACE AND HOME HARDENING STANDARDS SUCH AS- FIREPROOFING THEIR MEN'S- AND REMOVING FLAMMABLE MATERIAL FROM AROUND THEIR HOMES AND SO THAT WILL BE A HUGE TRYING HER FOR THOSE HOMEOWNERS THAT CAN'T AFFORD IT. TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A DIRECT INCENTIVES FROM THEIR INSURANCE COMPANY TO BE ABLE. SHE ABOUT HARD. AND THAT PROGRAM IS ALSO- NOT ONLY GOING TO BE FOCUSED ON THE INDIVIDUAL HOME BUT ALSO HAVING INSURANCE COMPANIES CHANGE. THEIR INCENTIVE STRUCTURE AROUND HOW A COMMUNITY- HAS ACHIEVED DEFENSIBLE SPACE AND HARDENING BECAUSE WE REALLY RECOGNIZED THAT WHILE AN INDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNER CAN MAKE AN IMPACT ON THEIR OWN WHICH THE FIRE MEDIATORS TRULY MODIFIED. WHEN YOU HAVE THE FULL COLLECTIVE ACTION. TO HOLD SO THAT YOU HE SAYS GET A SATURATION LEVEL ALMOST IT'S SORT OF A AN ALABASTER HERD IMMUNITY- IN A COMMUNITY BECAUSE SO THAT IT PREVENTS ALL OF THE STRUCTURES. I'M FROM BURNING BECAUSE ONCE YOU HEARD HAD A HEAT SIGNATURE OF A STRUCTURE BURNING. EVEN IF YOU'VE DONE DEFENSIBLE SPACE NEXT DOOR- THAT DAY HE SIGNATURE JUST GETS TOO HIGH. FOR YOUR INTERVENTION SO- SO WE BOTH THE PROGRAMS THAT WE'RE WORKING ON THAT ARE DOING EDUCATION AND OUTREACH ON THAT WE'VE INVESTED IN THE UC FIREFIGHTER PROGRAMS DEFENSIBLE SPACE INSPECTORS INCREASING. I'M GLAD HE'S PLANNING ON THANK THAT ALL CAME TO THE BUDGET LAST YEAR. I'M GLAD YOU CALLED AN ARE YOU SEE- AS WELL THE- INTERVENTION- ARE MAKING AN IMPACT ANY DO. RANT DOLLAR THANK YOU HAVE REGION LOCAL SAFETY THREE CUTS THIS. SCHOOLS TO BE ABLE EMPLOY- THOSE I THE DEFENSE WILL SPACE HARD ST FUEL. THAT REALLY HELPED. THOSE CAN. THOSE ARE IN AND I WE ARE SO SOME ACT. IN TERMS OF AND NORTHERN. OF THOSE DOLLARS. AND I'M STOP YOU'RE THERE JUST FOR A QUICK SECOND OR STERN ARDEN CERTAIN JOB IN- BUT IT THANK YOU FOR THE THOROUGHNESS AYE I. I JUST. YOU KNOW YOU TALK NORTHERN SOUTHERN I JUST WANT TO GET CLEAR WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE BECAUSE- I THINK THAT THAT DELINEATIONS- NOT WITH THE TRAILER LANGUAGE- IDENTIFIED IT TALKED ABOUT. POPULATION CENTERS. JUST TO BE CLEAR WHEN YOU SAY SOUTHERN YOU MEAN- YOUR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA DEFINITION FOR CALIFORNIA RIGHT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE- THE DEFINITION THAT INCLUDES EVERYTHING FROM. ALL THE WAY UP TO TWELVE ME RIGHT UP THROUGH MERCED UP IN THE CALAVERAS COUNTY THAT'S. THAT'S YOUR DEFINITION OF SOUTHERN RIGHT. YEAH LET ME TRY IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE DANIEL LANCE- AT CAL WHO CAN TALK IN A LITTLE MORE IN DETAIL ABOUT THE FIRE PREVENTION GRANT PROGRAM. AND AND HOW AN OUT REACHED THE CIVIC LEE THAT HAS BEEN- I GOING ON WITH I SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COUNTIES AND COMMUNITIES PREVIEW THEM BEFORE YOU GO TO DANIEL HAS BEEN WONDERFUL OVER THERE I DO I DO WANT TO APPRECIATE YOU FOR. THE MENTION THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE IN. AND HAVE AN AND I AND ALL THAT BT WHAT PROGRAM WERE YOU REFERRING TO THERE WHERE YOU WERE. TALKING ABOUT THE PILOT ON THE- INSURANCE- DISCOUNTS FOR. FOLKS WERE DOING HARDENING. YES THIS JUST ROLLED OUT ON MONDAY- AND- I THINK IT'S CALLED THE IT'S I THINK IT'S JUST CALLED THE FIRE. PREVENTION ANYWAY LOOK AT ALTERNATE TO DANIEL TO GIVE MORE. TO GO IT OKAY THE PROGRAM YEAH THANK YOU TELLS YOU OUT- DANIEL LANDIS'S AND DEPUTY DIRECTOR OVER ARE NEWLY MINTED COMMUNITY WILDFIRE PREPAREDNESS- IN MITIGATION DIVISION- ALL ANSWER THE FIRST PART OF YOUR QUESTION RELATED TO- THE OUTRAGE- THAT- WAS NOT ONLY DIRECTED BUT ALSO- THAT THAT WE DISCUSSED ON LAST YEAR- AT THESE HEARINGS- FOLLOWING THE EARLY ACTION DOLLARS- WE DID EXTENSIVE OUTREACH SPECIFICALLY IN. THE LA BASIN AREA AND THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA REGION NOW DANCER QUESTION YES WE REALLY CUT THE STATE IN HALF AND CONSIDER THE TOP HALF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND THE BOTTOM HALF WHICH DOES INCLUDE THE CENTRAL VALLEY AS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WHAT WE SPECIFICALLY WORK HARD AND ACTUALLY I WANT TO THANK YOU SENATOR STERN AND YOUR STAFF. WHO ACTUALLY MADE A NUMBER OF CONNECTIONS WITH US WITH THE PERFECT UP POTENTIAL GRANTEES ARE WITHIN YOUR DISTRICT THAT WE WERE ABLE TO DISCUSS- THE PROCESS AND REALLY WALK THEM THROUGH THE GRANT APPLICATION TO HELP THEM BE SUCCESSFUL IN THAT PROCESS OUR TEAM WORKED VERY HARD TO DO OUR BEST TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE AWARDING- THE BEST QUALITY BRANDS. BUT THAT WE'RE SPLITTING THAT OUT AS EVENLY ACROSS THE STATE AS POSSIBLE AND I WANT TO DRESS YOUR TO CONCERNS THE FOREST IN THE VEGETATION TYPE IS NOT A DIRECT- COMPONENT OF SOMETHING WE RANK THAT WE'RE LOOKING IN THIS PROGRAM SPECIFICALLY AT POPULATION BASIS SO HOW MANY HOMES HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE IMPACTED. OR BENEFIT FROM THIS PROJECT AND SO THE VEGETATION TYPE- IS REALLY LESS OF A CONSIDERATION ON THE SECOND PIECES WERE REALLY LOOKING AT FIRE REST IN THAT THAT THAT IS NOT NECESSARILY- IMMEDIATELY CONNECTED TO THE FOREST VERSUS OAK WOODLANDS VERSUS CHAPARRAL VERSUS GRASSLANDS ALL OF THOSE ARE GOING TO BE A- IMPACTED AND SO I JUST WANT TO YOU KNOW AT LEAST ANSWER THE QUESTION THAT THAT THIS PROGRAM IS NOT FOCUSING ONLY ON- FOREST. THAT WE ARE DEFINITELY INCLUDING- THE LA BASIN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA- VEGETATION TYPES AS- HIGH RANKING NOT AT. YEAH IN THE OVERALL. HOPEFULLY THAT I- THE FIRST PART OF YOUR BUT ALL I POSIT AND MAKE IT MORE THAN THEM GIVE ME ONE QUICK. UP B. IS YOU KNOW AND IT'S NOT JUST BROKE YOU INTERESTS HERE IN A. OR VENTURA BE LOOKING OUT FOR MY COLLEAGUES IN MARIN COUNTY AND SAN DIEGO IN SAN BERNADINO AND RIVERSIDE SO- WITH THAT DEFINITION IN. THE COUNTIES I JUST NAMED- HAVE HAD LIKE HOW MANY DOLLARS WENT OUT THE DOOR LIKE HOW MANY DOLLARS WENT OUT THE DOOR AND ORANGE COUNTY. AS A AGAIN SECRETARY I JUST FROM MORRIS MENTIONED WE WILL GET INTO YOU- VERY VERY QUICKLY HERE- THE FULL BREAKDOWN OF ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES TO SEE. HOW MEANT TO SHOW YOU AND THE PUBLIC HOW MANY APPLICATIONS ARE RECEIVED. AND ON HOW MANY- WERE ACTUALLY AWARDED SO YOU'LL FOLLOW UP. WITH WITH THAT- QUESTION AND DID YOU WERE THERE WORKSHOPS DONE IN IN ALL THOSE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COUNTIES I MENTIONED DID YOU DID YOU HAVE. PUBLIC FORUMS AND STAY SAN DIEGO ORANGE COUNTY SAN BERNARD DINO RIVERSIDE LA VENTURA. YEAH OUR LATEST- AROUND THAT WE JUST DID- OCCURRED DURING THE MONTH OF DECEMBER AND JANUARY- AND OF COURSE DURING THIS SAME TIME PERIOD WAS SPIKES IN COAL BIT AND SO- YOU KNOW TO BE RESPECTFUL OF THE HEALTH CONCERNS AND THE- GIVEN THE RESTRICTIONS- WE WENT TO A VIRTUAL PLATFORM NOW WHAT WE REALLY HAVE FOUND IN THESE. PLATFORMS IS THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE- I WOULD SAY QUADRUPLED IF NOT TEN TIMES- EXPANDED- THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE AND DO PARTICIPATE IN THESE MEETINGS SO. THE ANSWER QUESTION NO WE WERE NOT UNFORTUNATELY ABLE TO HOLD MEETINGS IN EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE COUNTY BOTTOMING PHYSICALLY I JUST MEAN WITH THOSE COUNTIES. I DON'T MEAN THAT YOU PLACE YOURSELF PHYSICALLY THERE DID YOU DID YOU. WORK WITH THOSE NAMES COUNTY'S INDIVIDUALLY TO HAVE THOSE KIND OF DIGITAL WORKSHOPS. THAT WE INVITED- FIRE SAFE COUNCILS- PAST- ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE EXPRESSED INTEREST- AND WE HAVE HUNDREDS OF ORGANIZATIONS THAT FOLLOW ARE- YEAH- IT LIST SERVE- TO BE INVOLVED IN SO. WE DID OUTREACH TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY WERE INCLUDED IN NOT JUST. JOIN US IN THE WORKSHOP ANSWER QUESTIONS BUT ALSO THAT WORKSHOP WAS POSTED ONLINE ALONG WITH BROKEN ASK QUESTIONS ANY EMAIL ADDRESSES. WHICH ARE STAFF HAVE- OVER THE APPLICATION CARE AND BEEN ABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. AND SO AGAIN I DON'T HAVE ANY SPECIFICS FOR IT TODAY ON ON THOSE COUNTIES YOU LISTED BUT I KNOW THAT WE DID. OUTREACH WITH ORGANIZATIONS WITHIN THEM. OKAY CENTER I COULD ADD ONE PIECE ANOTHER REALLY IMPORTANT- PART OF OUR STRATEGY TO REALLY INCREASE- THE NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS IN. ALL SAY LA BASIN BUT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AS WELL. IS THERE IS A DIFFERENCE IN THE NUMBER OF FIRE SAFE COUNCILS AND FIREWISE COMMUNITIES IN WHAT WE CONSIDER NORTHERN CALIFORNIA VERSUS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND SO WE REALLY BEEN WORKING ON THE CAPACITY BUILDING TO HELP BUILD UP FUTURE FIRE SAFE COUNCILS AND REALLY ENSURE- THAT DOES THOSE TRADITIONALLY SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AREAS THAT HAVE BEEN JUST AS AFFECTED BY WILDFIRES BUT I DON'T HAVE THE- THE SAME NUMBER GRASSROOTS EFFORTS ORGANIZATIONS. THAT WE FUND THOSE AND IN FACT THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE CALIFORNIA FIRE SAFE COUNCIL- AND THEY WILL CONTINUE TO BE ROLLING OUT SOME ANNOUNCEMENTS A VERY SOON HERE. WITH FUNDING THAT HELPS BUILD COUNTY COORDINATORS THAT THEY CAN TURN AROUND AND HELP NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATIONS OR- COMMUNITIES DEVELOP. FIRE SAFE COUNCILS AND THAT WILL START TO BUILD UP OUR OVERALL CAPACITY TO GET MORE ORGANIZATIONS THAT WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR GRANTS AND WE BELIEVE THAT THAT WILL BE- THE ANSWER TO REALLY BEEFING UP THE NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS. AND PROJECTS THATWE FIND IN THE LA BASIN AS WELL AS THE SOUTHERN REGION. YEAH OKAY ARNAUD ALL ALL TRYING TO WRAP UP HERE MITER CHAIR THANK YOU FOR THE INTELLIGENCE- IT SOUNDS. LIKE THE ANSWER MY CALL. IS IT IS WE'LL GET BACK TO YOU. BUT IT'S OUT LIKE. KNOW THAT IN THE- COUNTY OUTREACH WAS NOT DONE. IN THOSE. FIVE OR SIX MAKE A COUNTIES DOWN SOUTH BUT THEY'RE BOTH SORT OF MORE CENTRALIZED- NGOS BASED OUTREACH WAS DONE WITH SOME YEAH WITH SOME BLAST I JUST KNOW THAT. FOR THE COMMUNITIES WHO ARE NOT LISTSERVS- PEOPLE HAVE NO IDEA THAT THESE PROGRAMS EVEN EXIST- AND YOU KNOW THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE LOOKING FOR- THEY'RE THEY'RE LOOKING FOR HELP I MEAN. WE DO HERE. IS NOT A RICH NEIGHBORHOOD IN. THE SOUTHERN PART OF LA AND YOU KNOW HERE ARE PARTS OF RIVERSIDE THEY BURN IT YOU KNOW THESE ARE NOT IT'S NOT ALL WE'RE NOT TALKING JUST ABOUT MALIBU AND CALABASAS HERE. SO I HOPE THAT. YOU KNOW WE CAN GET THAT OVERDUE REPORT IT'S TWO WEEKS IN NOW AND- AND THE LAST QUESTION IS THIS ARE YOU I DON'T SEE A B. SB SIXTY THREE IMPLEMENTATION. IS THAT- AM I MISSING THAT IS THAT ON ON YOUR RADAR. YEAH THERE IS A BUDGET PROPOSAL IN IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET- TITLED THE COMMUNITY WILDFIRE AND PREPAREDNESS- LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE AND DOES INCLUDE SENATE BILL SIXTY THREE YOURS- AS WELL AS EIGHTY NINE AND- EIGHTY SIX FORTY TWO SO THERE THERE IS NOT TOTAL FOR STAFFING TO IMPLEMENT- YOUR LEGISLATION. ROGER AND SO THAT THAT'S NOT IN THIS OTHER BCP WE'VE BEEN REVIEWING HERE THAT'S IN A SEPARATE. THAT'S IN A SEPARATE ITEM IS THAT FAIR ENOUGH I'M LOOKING COMMUNITY PREPAREDNESS AND PREVENT FIRE PREVENTION SO. OKAY SO THAT'S SORT OF ALL WRAPPED UP THE HOME HARDENING PIECE THE SIXTY THREE PIECE- ARE YOU GUYS PUTTING FUNDING TOWARDS THIS THIS DEAL WHY PROGRAM THAT TO. MS MOORE'S JUST MENTION THE SAFER FROM WILDFIRES PROGRAM. YEP FIRST LET ME AT THE HOME HARNEY FUNDING WITH OUR JOINT PROGRAM WITH CALLAWAY YES IS PART OF THE PACKAGE THAT WE'RE DISCUSSING TODAY SENATE BILL SIXTY THREE IS IN ITS OWN- ITS OWN. BCP WITH THOSE LEADS BILLS I MENTIONS I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY WHY IS. SEPARATE WE'RE TALKING THE FENCE SPACE AND GARDENING TODAY THAT'S WHAT THE BILL IS. WHAT WHY IS THAT SEPARATE- THE RESOURCES AND THE PERSON. THAT TO OUR NEED TO IMPLEMENT THE SPECIFIC. SECTIONS IN SENATE BILL SIXTY THREE ARE IN THE STANDALONE BCP THE MONEY THAT'S IN THIS LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE THAT WORKED OR THIS- WILDFIRE FORCED RESILIENCE PACKAGE THAT WE'RE- TALKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW. AUGMENTS OUR OUR OUR BASELINE SERVICES- IN BOTH EVENTS WILL SPACE INSPECTIONS AS WELL AS- HOME HARDENING- AND FUEL REDUCTION WORK. AND SO YES THEY WILL GO HAND IN HAND. BUT THE SPECIFIC. TOOLS AND RESOURCES NEEDED EMPLOYMENT THE LEGISLATION- FROM SB SIXTY THREE. YEARS OUTSIDE OF THIS- ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLAR PACKAGE SO YOU'RE SAYING. THE LEGISLATION WE PASSED IS NOT PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S WILDFIRE INFORMERS FORCE RESILIENCE PACKAGE. CORRECT IT'S IN IT'S IN A SEPARATE B. C. I'LL PULL UP THE AGENDA AND SHOW YOU THAT YOU GOT A LOT OF ISSUE NUMBER OF WHERE THAT. YEARS BACK. SERGIO ARE AND FROM. CAN ANSWER I MEAN I THINK- SENATOR DOESN'T KNOW THAT IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR US TO THE INFO. OF THOSE ONE BILL YEAH WE PACKAGE UP TO BE I THINK POSSIBLY TO VISIBILITY WE WORK THOSE WHAT THE STATE FELT. IT DOES CREATE CONFUSION I DON'T WANT YOU TO DROP THIS THAT WERE SO DEEP. IMPLEMENTATION OF THOSE BELTS DON'T. HAPPEN OVERNIGHT AGUILAR BURKE YOU KNOW I THAT SEPARATION AND HE'S. THANKS YEAH LEVINE ADDED SO DIFFICULT WHEN WE HAVE PROPOSAL REALLY TO EVERYTHING WE CAN LEGISLATION WE DO ALL ABOUT THAT INDIVIDUAL WE DON'T KIND OF MAKE SURE ARE PEOPLE AT TO DIG THROUGH ALL BE LIKE THAT SHOWS THAT IT REQUIREMENT ALTHOUGH PLEDGE. NOW THEY'RE MY BE OTHER COMP RECALL BY THAT- WE DO COMPLEMENT BUT TYPICALLY YOU KNOW WE COME BY- THE RELIGIOUS STATION BE COULD BE EXACTLY ARE CALLED OUT AND SO THEY'RE STILL IN THE GULF BUDGET THEY'RE JUST NOT IN IN THIS PROJECT AYE I'D THEY WOULD BE A SEPARATE IDA BUT THEY'RE ALL IMPORTANT PRIOR THAT WE ARE QUITE WHICH IS WHY WE ARE MOVING FORWARD NUMBER CAN I THE I DON'T MEAN TO GET SOME ABOUT WE IT IS I WHAT I WAS TRYING TO GET OUT IS THAT PIECE OF IT CRITICAL PART OF THE- STRATEGY AT THE THAT'S ALL WAS GETTING NOT SO MUCH A- YOU KNOW WHAT I. IN THE IN THE BUT MORE SO THAT THAT. COMMUNITY HOME HARDENING- LIKE IS THE GO. GOAL WE KNOW AN ACREAGE GOAL. WHAT IS THE POP. FOR GO. WHAT IS IT A NUMBER OF. GO IS A NUMBER OF PEOPLE GOAL LIKE. I GUESS THAT'S WHAT I'M SORT GETTING AS LIKE WHAT WHAT'S PROTECT THIS NOT JUST HOW MANY ACRES DO YOU SEEK TO TREAT. THIS IS AND IF I COULD ANSWER- AS PART OF ASSEMBLY BILL NINE WILL BE BRINGING BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE A REPORT ON THE RESOURCES AND TOOLS NEEDED- IN IN FIRE PREVENTION. BUT TO ANSWERQUESTIONS IT IS A VITAL COMPONENT OF THE OVERALL STRATEGY AGAIN IT DON'T WANT TO GET MIXED UP AND YOU KNOW WHY THERE ARE SEPARATE- BUT- BUT HOLISTICALLY TOGETHER ENSURING THAT THAT WE HAVE. ADEQUATE DEFENSIBLE SPACE THAT WORK HARDENING HOMES OR BUILDING FUEL- BREAKS AROUND THEN IT IS ABSOLUTELY A COMPONENT OF THE OVERALL STRATEGY I APPRECIATE THAT I'M JUST ASKING IS THERE A NUMBER. DID YOU GUYS HAVE A GREAT SET OF GOALS FOR YOURSELF IN TERMS OF NUMBER OF COMMUNITIES YOU WANT TO PROTECT OR NUMBER OF HOMES YOU WANT TO PROTECT IS THAT IS IT IS THE MINISTRATION AND ITS PLAN HAVE A- HAVE A DRIVING. METRICS NOT SO MUCH A- QUALITATIVE GO. WHAT WE A NUMBER OF- ITEMS THAT ARE. IN WILDFIRE FOR ITS FIRST. ACTION PLAN I KNOW WAS NOTED THAT THAT YOU'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THAT TODAY BUT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF. OF ITEMS IN THERE THAT WILL- BUILD UPON. TO I THINK ANSWER THE QUESTIONS AND SOME OF THE MORE SPECIFIC NUMBERS THAT YOUR- WORK RIGHT NOW OUR GOAL BUT WE DO HAVE A FUEL REDUCTION ACRES BOWL. AND A DEFENSIBLE SPACE SCHOOL- THOSE ARE TWO BILLS THAT ARE SET TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND INSPECTIONS IS WHAT WE ARE. I CONTINUE TO WORK TOWARDS. YOUR SPECIFIC LEGISLATION IS GOING TO HELP US BE ABLE TO DO- INITIAL TRAINING AND CURRICULUM. TO AUGMENT- THE EDUCATION IN THE ASSESSMENT SECOND DONNA DEFENSIBLE SPACE AND THAT'S GOING TO. CRITICALLY I HELP OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR GOAL OF NOT JUST INSPECTING TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND HOMES. BUT ENSURING THAT THE ERROR WITHIN COMPLIANCE AND THAT THEY HAVE THE TOOLS AND RESOURCES TO BE IN COMPLIANCE RIGHT. EIGHT I'LL WRAP UP HEREBUT- THE ANSWER THOUGH IS THAT. THERE IS NOT CURRENTLY A METRIC FOR NUMBER OF COMMUNITIES THAT ARE. SOUGHT TO BE HARDENED OR NUMBER OF PEOPLE LIKE. THAT THAT METRIC IS NOT IN THERE I GET THAT YOU HAVE A DEFENSIBLE SPACE NUMBER OF DOING A FIFTY THOUSAND. BUT IT IS. IN THAT BIGGER PLAN. DRIVING THIS WHOLE PACKAGE HERE. IS THERE A- NUMBER COMMUNITY NUMBER. ARE PROPERTIES SCHOOL. BETTER LET US FOLLOW UP AND GET OKAY OKAY I THANK YOU AND JUST TO RECAP ON THE NORTHERN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THERE'S SEVENTY MILLION THAT'S GOING EARLY WILDFIRE PREVENTION GRANTS TO NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND SIXTY THREE TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BUT THE CONSERVANCY FUNDS. A HUNDRED AND FIVE MILLION WHAT TO NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA GOT A HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IN CONSERVANCY FUND SO. IN THE OLD DAYS WHEN YOU HAD THIS KODAK MOMENT IT'S PLUS THREE MILLION SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TO BE CONTINUED I NEED TO MOVE ON BUT I CAN'T HELP MYSELF COULD NOT ASKING THE KIDS SEER CONSERVANCY TO CHECK IN AND GIVE US SOME ACCOUNTABILITY. WE HAVE CONGRATULATIONS ON GETTING ALL YOUR EARLY FIRE- MONEY OUT THE DOOR WE DON'T HAVE A NUMBER ON THE PROJECTS THAT ARE IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET ON WHERE THAT MONEY HAS BEEN ACCOUNTABLE AND CONGRATULATIONS ON. GETTING TWO MILLION MORE ACRES OF RESPONSIBILITY TO GO FROM TWENTY FIVE MILLION TO TWENTY SEVEN MILLION AND THE BIG EXTRA POINTS EXTRA CREDIT POINTS IS THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES TEN MILLION THIS YEAR AND TEN MILLION NEXT YEAR FOR TWENTY SEVEN MILLION ACRES OF FOREST LANDS. AND I'D LIKE TO HAVE YOUR COMMENT. THERE'S BEEN SOME ACTION OR SOME INCLINATION WITH THIS SUB COMMITTEE TO GIVE MORE MONEY TO WRECK LEAD TO THE CONSERVANCY'S TO DO THE FIRE PREVENTION WORK THE TWO THERE SO IF YOU COULD GIVE US. A NUMBER OF. PROJECTS THAT YOU BELIEVE YOU COULD FIND IN THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS. MS AVERY YOU'RE ON. THANK YOU THE CHAIRMAN AWAKE HOUSEKI AND SUBCOMMITTEE MEMBERS OF MY NAME'S ANGELA ABRAHAM EXECUTIVE OFFICERS YOU'RE ABOUT TO CONSERVANCY HAPPY TO BE WITH YOU HERE TODAY THANKS FOR THE CONGRATULATIONS ON THE BOUNDARY EXPANSION- CREDIT FOR THAT GOES TO SENATOR DOLLY AND WAS LEGISLATION THAT- ADDED THOSE IMPORTANT REGIONS THAT IMPORTANT REGIONS YOU ARE BOUNDARY. ALSO YOU MENTIONED THE EARLY ACTION FUNDING WE GOT TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS OF THAT OF FUNDING AND WERE ABLE TO GET THAT FUNDING OUT ON THE GROUND VERY QUICKLY A TOTAL OF FIFTEEN GRANTS AND APPROXIMATELY WE'RE GONNA BY THE ACRES TOTAL NUMBER OF ACRES I'LL GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT- FORGET THAT MONEY ON THE GROUND REALLY QUICKLY WE'VE RELEASED A TWENTY FIVE OF THE FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT WE GOT IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET IN GRANT GUIDELINES IN JANUARY. WE ACTUALLY HELD THAT FUNDING A LITTLE BIT TO BE SURE OF THAT THE NEW REGION THAT WAS ADDED TO OUR BOUNDARY- THE BOUNDARY EXPANSION WAS ELIGIBLE TO APPLY FOR THAT FUNDING AS A RESULT OF THE GRANT APPLICATIONS BY THE END IN THIRTY DAYS WE RECEIVED FORTY NINE CONCEPT PROPOSALS TOTALING FORTY TWO. POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS AND REQUESTS WE ACTUALLY OF THAT TOTAL AMOUNT RECEIVED A THIRTY FOUR PROPOSALS WHICH WERE IN THE PROCESS OF EVALUATING NOW OUR PLAN IS TO RELEASE THE SECOND TWENTY FIVE MILLION. OF THE TOTAL FIFTY MILLION THAT WE RECEIVED IN THIS BUDGET YEAR INGRATE GUIDELINES- IN IN JUNE OF THIS YEAR- WE WERE TRYING TO SORT OF SPREAD BECAUSE WE KNEW THAT THERE WERE SO MANY PROJECTS THAT WERE INTERESTED AND NEARLY READY TO GET OUT FUNDING WE HELD A LITTLE BIT OF THAT- TO MAKE SURE THAT PROJECTS. TO BE FULLY DEVELOPED. WITH THINKING ABOUT A NEW READ- IT WILL. TO WHETHER OR NOT WE CAN SPEND THAT GOVERNOR'S. IS TWENTY MILLION THE S. C. O. TO YOU. THERE MILLION IN NEXT YEAR AND- TWELVE MILLION AND YOUR POST- WE OF EVERY CONFIDENCE THAT WE CAN GET THAT MONEY ON THE GROUND QUICKLY AND EFFICIENTLY ARE PART OF THE REASON WE ARE REVISING OUR GRANT GUIDELINES. IN JUNE IS TO BE SURE THAT ANY ADDITIONAL FUNDING COME THAT COMES TO THIS YEAR ABOUT A CONSERVANCY CAN SIMPLY BE ADDED. TO THOSE GUIDELINES WITHOUT HAVING TO REDO THEM- AND SO AT EVERY CONFIDENCE THAT WE CAN COME IN THE NEED AND OUR REGION IS. IS HUGE AS HERE ARE WHERE SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF CALIFORNIA'S VIRUS IS IN THE SIERRA NEVADA REGION- AND WE'VE SEEN SOME OF THE LARGEST FIRES WE'VE EVER SEEN AS YOU ARE ALL ARE. ARE VERY MUCH AWARE. AND WHAT'S YOUR- WHICH ACCOUNT I KNOW I UNDERSTAND YOU GOT FOR THREE EIGHT MILLION AND- WHAT'S THE NEED YOU HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE- THE WOODED AREA OVERHEAD AN- EXCELLENT DISCUSSION ON BIO. FUELS AND THINNING AND THIS IS OUR RESILIENCY PACKAGE OF THE TWENTY SEVEN MILLION ACRES THAT YOU CONTROL. WE'VE BEEN TOLD THAT WE NEED TO BE SPENDING TWO BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR OVER THE NEXT DECADE TO TRY TO GET. THE THAT THE FORCE IN SHAPE SO TWENTY FIVE MILLION FOR TWO YEARS IT DOESN'T SEEM TO REALLY MEET THE CHALLENGE. ARE WE MISGUIDED BY TRYING TO BE BELIEVING THAT WE NEED TO HAVE. THAT MUCH MONEY TO DO TO GET OUR FORCING SHE BECAUSE OF THE PAST- NEGLECT OR HUGE I CAN'T CHARACTERIZE THE ACTUAL DOLLAR AMOUNT TO IN OUR REGION AT THIS POINT WE ARE WORKING ON REGIONAL PLANNING WHICH WOULD CAPTURE SHOVEL READY PROJECTS ON ABOUT THREE MILLION ACRE SCALES ACROSS OUR STATE AND IN SEVEN REGIONS ACROSS THE SIERRA NEVADA- AS AS SERVICE AREA THAT WE SERVE- BUT THERE AGAIN ON THE ESSENCE HE IS ONE OF MANY- ADMINISTRATION FUNDERS- AND SO I THINK THAT YOU KNOW IT I DON'T HAVE AN ACTUAL DOLLAR AMOUNT FOR YOU AS IT RELATES TO THE FULL SCALE OF NEED I CAN SAY THAT IT'S ENORMOUS- I CAN SAY THAT THERE ARE MANY ASPECTS OF THE FUNDING THAT NEED TO BE CONSIDERED FROM. ENVIRONMENTAL PERMITTING- YOU KNOW CAPACITY BUILDING TO MAKE SURE THAT THE FUNDING CAN GET ON THE GROUND AND I BELIEVETHAT MINISTRATIONS BUDGET CVERS A LOT OF THOSE DIFFERENT NEEDS ACROSS A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT. HI MONTHS- I CAN I SAY THAT DOESN'T SEE A WAR. AND TWENTY DOLLAR JUST. PER IN A YOU KNOW A COUPLE OF MONTHS WITH THE EARLY ACTION- WE'VE GOT WE'RE GENERALLY SPEAKING- THE DOLLAR AMOUNT THAT IS REQUESTED OF US FOR FUNDING IS. MOSTLY DOUBLE OR NEARLY DOUBLE EACH TIME WE RELEASE. A BUCKET OF FUNDING- BUT I CAN'T SAY WE NEED SIX BILLION DOLLARS ACROSS TWENTY SEVEN MILLION ACRES AT THIS POINT THAT WE ARE WORKING TO TRY AND- BETTER UNDERSTAND THAT WE WILL BE THERE. THEY WOULD ONE BE THERE BY JUNE MAYBE BY THE END OF THE YEAR IF WERE. INCORRECTLY RECORD THAT WILL CONCLUDE OUR- ISSUE NUMBER NINETEEN STAFF RECOMMENDATION IS TO HOLD IT WE WILL BE ASKING. OTHER QUESTIONS LET'S TAKE OFF OUR- FORSTER HATS AND PUT ON OUR FIREFIGHTERS HAD TO MOVE TO PROPOSAL- GOD. ISSUE NUMBER. RELATED TO FIRE. SUPPRESS AND- ASSESSED ALMOST NINE MILLION TO. THIS YEAR AN ONGOING FOR SUPPRESSION- WHAT'S OUR DISCUSSION. SECTOR. THANK THANKS SO MUCH SHOT YOUR WHITE HOUSE OKAY AND I'LL TURN IT OVER TO KEEP TYLER WITHIN CAL FIRE IN JUST A MOMENT BUT I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT WHILE WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT- PREVENTION OR WHAT I CALL WILDFIRE RESILIENCE FOR THE LAST HOUR AND A HALF. CRITICALLY IMPORTANT IT'S CONTINUING TO BUILD OUR CAPACITY TO RESPOND TO WILDFIRES AND AGAIN SO PROUD OF THE PARTNERSHIP WITH CAL FIRE AND WE ASK THE MUTUAL AID RESPONDERS TO A REAL HORRIFIC WILDFIRE SEASON LAST. I WANT A PARTICULAR. ON THAT WILL PROVIDE RELIEF STOPPING. OUR FIRE BY ARE DOING KERR. TO THEMSELVES AND FAMILIES CONNECTING. AND SO I HAS YOUR TILE TALKING. PART OF THIS IS REALLY FOCUS ON.

WELL TRY TO REDUCE THE DEATH AND DESTRUCTION OF- PROPERTY LIVES IN IT NATURI SOURCES IN CALIFORNIA AND SO AS WE GO FORWARD WE TALK ABOUT- BOTH PERSONNEL AND EQUIPMENT THAT COULD BE USED FOR THE PURPOSES OF IT TRYING TO REDUCE THE WILDFIRE. OCCURRENCES IN CALIFORNIA TO BE ABLE TO- TO ALSO PROVIDE RELIEF TO OUR EMPLOYEES ACROSS CALIFORNIA- AS WELL THE FIRST SUBJECT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT TODAY ASK DO WITH- THE FIRST PROPOSAL IS- OUR OUR COMPUTER AIDED DISPATCH AN AUTOMATIC VEHICLE LOCATION PROGRAM HARDWARE AND SERVICE REFRESH- THIS PROGRAM REALLY IS A COUPLE COMPONENTS THE COMPUTER AIDED DISPATCH SYSTEM IS THE COR SYSTEM THAT. IS WITHIN OUR TWENTY ONE COMMAND CENTERS ACROSS CALIFORNIA THE DISPATCHER RESOURCES- TO ALL TYPES OF ALL HAZARD EMERGENCIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA INCLUDING- INCLUDING WILDFIRES. BEEN AN EXTENSION OF THE PROGRAM IS THE AUTUMN OF VEHICLE OKAY PROGRAM THIS WAS UP TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN I BELIEVE- WHERE WE ADDED TWELVE HUNDRED- AUTOMATIC VEHICLE LOCATION SYSTEMS INTO- OUR FRONTLINE VEHICLES OF FIRE ENGINES. EMERGENCY CREW TRANSPORT THE TIME SHE VEHICLES ACROSS CALIFORNIA- AND IT BECAME A PRIME RESOURCE THAT EXTENDS CRITICAL INFORMATION TO THOSE FRONT LINE FIRE ENGINES- MOVING FORWARD IT'S IPORTANT TO NOTE THAT- THAT- WE COME FORWARD WITH A CAT A REFRESHER WHAT WE CALL THIS CAT REFRESH EVERY FIVE YEARS. AND THE PURPOSE FOR THAT REALLY IS THAT- THE CAT A HARDWARE ITSELF WILL GO OUT OF WARRANTY AND UNDER CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY. RECOMMENDED GUIDELINES- WE WILL TYPICALLY REPLACE. OUR HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE FOR COMPUTER AIDED DISPATCH SYSTEM EVERY FIVE TO SEVEN YEARS- THAT IS CAN CURRENT IN A SIMILAR TO OUR SISTER AGENCY IT C. H. P.

IN THAT A RESPONSE OPERATION- OVERALL THE PILOT PROVED TO BE VERY SUCCESSFUL AND PROVIDED MUCH NEEDED. REAL TIME INTEL A SITUATIONAL AWARENESS IT ALSO IDENTIFIED TO US THAT IT WAS LIMITED IN ITS- CURRENT CAPACITY. IT DEMONSTRATED TO US THAT.

OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS IT'S BEEN PROVEN TO BE A VERY CRITICAL INTEL AND DATA GATHERING SYSTEM IT HAS BEEN VITAL DURING A RECENT WILDFIRE SEASON AND WE SHOULD MAKE IT CLEAR THAT BED BATH BEYOND WILDFIRES THIS CAPABILITY HAS BEEN USED. FOR ALL HAZARDS- AND CAN'T BE USED FOR ALL HAZARDS INCLUDING- INCLEMENT WEATHER OIL SPILLS WHICH WE COULD USE IT ENOUGH HUNTINGTON BEACH OIL SPILL OFTEN LARGE COUNTY EARTHQUAKES MUDFLOW AND DEBRIS FLOWS AND OTHER EVENTS LIKE SEARCH AND RESCUE OPERATIONS. ALTHOUGH IT'S- ABOUT THE PRO WHICH WAS HERE. AND ALSO MAY IT. IT A PERMANENT STATE PROGRAM- AND GET A BETTER COMPONENT INTO THE BEACH LAYS STORAGE. WIRE PROP- TO- AND- FAN THAT MAKES IT A STATEWIDE PRO. ONE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA ONE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH CAL FIRE WILL BRING THEIR WILDFIRE FIREFIGHTING EXPERTISE AS MEMBERS OF THE TEAM TO MEET THEIR SPECIFIC NEEDS AS WELL AS PARTICIPANTS. IN THE MUTUAL AID SYSTEM. SO THAT'S IN ESSENCE THE SUMMARY OF THIS PARTICULAR- BOB- AND THIS THIS THIS CAPABILITY I'M OF COURSE I HAVE YEAR TO DATE. G. PART MARSHALL ARE WHICH STATE FARM RESCUE. CHIEF AND- AND OF COURSE. ACTOR JOE TYLER WHO YOU JUST HEARD FROM- THE PROTECTION FIRE IT WORKING ON THIS JOINT. AND CAN ANSWER ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS NOT THAT I'M GONNA JUMP LINE WERE THE L. A- BUT THE FOR THE CASE THAT YOU KNOW THE- WE NEEDED THIS. ON THE EXIT WHILE RE. AND CAPACITY THAT IS STILL. HAS BEEN DELIVERED WAS TO IN TWO TWENTY BUT MORE. ON ENHANCE YOUR FIVE. AND ME AIDES IT'S UNCLEAR TO WHAT EXTENT THE FUNDING WILL BE USED BY- YES TO REPLACE EXISTING FIRE ENGINES MORE FREQUENTLY OR PROVIDE MORE WROTE ROBUST MAINTENANCE OF.OF THAT WITHOUT THIS BASIC INFORMATION. WORDS YOU KNOW THAT THE COMMITTEE HAS A DIFFICULT TIME COULD YOU SHED SOME LIGHT ON THAT. WELL I'M WELL.MAYBE A CLERK BY THE FOR- SATURDAY THE THAT THE FUNDING IS REQUESTING- FUNDING FOR- THESE TWO- NONE OF THIS BY THE GO TO SUPPORT FIRE ENGINES THAT'S THAT'S DIFFERENT FUNDING. THIS IS I'M TALKING ABOUT THE ENHANCE FIRE AND RESCUE MUTUAL AID FIRE FLEET THE PROPOSAL SUPPORTS- YESS MUTUAL AID FIRE ENGINE PROGRAM. SORRY BUT THIS SPECIFICALLY IT'S UNCLEAR WHAT EXTENT THE FUNDING WOULD BE USED BY- YES TO REPLACE EXISTING FIRE ENGINES MORE FREQUENTLY OR YOU PROVIDING MORE MAINTENANCE UNDERSTAND ON THOSE EXISTING. TO COMBAT FLEET THAT YOU HAVE I GOT YOU NOW OKAY ALL OF ME I'M HAVE CHIEF MARSHAL. THANK YOU DIRECTOR GHILARDUCCI. THE REQUEST IS- TO PROVIDE MAINTENANCE AND REPLACEMENT OF OUR EXISTING FLEET. NO ADDITIONAL FIRE APPARATUS ARE BEING ADDED. AS A RESULT OF THE GOVERNOR'S BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION- THERE WAS A FIRE REPORT BASED ON THE TWO THOUSAND AND THREE FIRES- THAT DESTROYED- COUNTLESS HOMES AND ACRES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. THERE WAS A RECOMMENDATION THAT- YES AB ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIRE ENGINES- TO THE MUTUAL AID SLEEP. WE HAVE NOW RECEIVED AND IN THE PROCESS OF DISTRIBUTING THESE FIRE ENGINES- FIRE ENGINES DO NOT- HAVE- FOREVER LIFESPAN AND THEY NEED TO BE REPLACED. PLUS THE USE OF THESE FIRE ENGINES- THIRTY THIS YEAR ROUND FIRE SEASON WHERE THAT THE FIREFIGHTERS AND FIRE ENGINES ARE OFTEN ON THE FRONT LINES FOR TWENTY FOUR TO THIRTY SIX HOURS. AND EXTREMELY- TOUGH CONDITIONS THERE'S MORE MAINTENANCE SO THIS PROPOSAL IS TO. INCREASE OUR MAINTENANCE AND REPLACEMENT OF OUR EXISTING FLEET. ON A IDENTIFIED SCHEDULE- THERE'S ADDITIONAL MECHANICS. TO- ASSISTA THE THESE FIRE- ENGINES WE OFTEN DISPATCH R. O. S. MECHANICS OUT TO THE- THE FIRE LINES TO KEEP THESE FIRE TRUCKS IN SERVICE SO THEY'RE AVAILABLE AND TO FIGHT THESE CATASTROPHIC FIRES. PRETTY GOOD ALL RIGHT LET'S MOVE TO THE CONSERVATION CORPS A DIRECTOR SETO YOU'VE GOT SOME. FIRE CREWS- AN AUGMENTATION CAN YOU UPDATE US ON WHAT YOU'VE DONE WITH THE BUDGET MONIES THAT WE HAVE AND WHAT RICK WHAT'S HAPPENING BEFORE US. THANK YOU CAN FOR CASPIAN'S COMMITTEE MEMBERS STOP. RELATED THE WILDFIRES SUPPRESSION PACKAGE- THE CULTURE CORPS PROPOSING. EIGHTY SEVEN THOUSAND TO- BIRDS ARE TEN OF OUR RESOURCE PRODUCED FIRE HANK TWENTY. AND ARE OUR GENERAL FOR PROPOSED TO. IS ONE MILLION SEVEN ARMS NINE DOLLARS- TO AND I'M GOING TO FUND. TO RIDE SIZE OUR FAR THAT WOULD NEED ADDING- THIRTEEN. AT OUR CAMERA CENTER HAS FOR ONE CREWS A PARTNERSHIP WE CAL.

AND OF COURSE YOU ARE AS KNOW WE ARE A VERY BUSY SEASON- KIND. EVEN THIS NOT FAR APART RAW. OR ONLINE DATA UNDER THE OUR YEAR SO I. THIS IS- REQUEST LAST YEAR WORK A OUR OUR OUR- DEPARTMENT WITH ALL PARTS WE LOOK FORWARD TO- HEARING ANY QUESTIONS OR- ADDRESSING CONCERN THAT YOU WERE THERE CAN BE WHITE HOUSE. GENERAL RESPONSE TO THE PROPOSAL. MISTER CHAIR STEVEN BENSON WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IF I IF I COULD FOR- STRIGULATED- SO ON THE FOUR HUNDRED MILLION WE'RE CONTINUING TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS- HERE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE HAVE A GOOD DELIVER CONVERSATIONS WITH THE FIREFIGHTER ASSOCIATIONS IN THE BEST WAYS TO GO ABOUT HELPING. ADDRESS THE FIREFIGHTER HEALTH AND SAFETY AND THAT'S REALLY THE FOCUS THAT FORTY MILLION- THERE IS A LITTLE OVERLAP WITH SOME OF THE SURGE FIRE- PROTECTION PROPOSALS FOR EXAMPLE WELL THE ONE IN THERE IS THERE'S A PROPOSAL TO PURCHASE FOR NEW SIKORSKY FIREHAWK- HELICOPTERS IN THE STAFFING OR SAID THAT WOULD BE COVERED WITHIN THAT FORTY MILLION BUT- OTHERWISE THE FOCUS OF THAT IS REALLY ON. HOW RIGHT SIZING. AND- ADDRESSING A FIREFIGHTERS AND SO WE'RE WORKING ON TRYING TO DEVELOP THOSE DETAILS AND HOPING TO BRING IN FORCE YOU CAN BUT- UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVEN'T GOT THAT. AVAILABLE TO SHARE AT THIS TIME. MMHM YOU KNOW THERE'S THIS GREAT DEBATE THAT'S GOING ON BETWEEN PREVENTION AND SUPPRESSION AND IT'S IN. AND WE'RE MINDFUL THAT THE BUDGET FOR SUPPRESSION GOING FORWARD IS TWICE AS MUCH AS IT IS FOR. PREVENTION IS. THIS FINANCED THINK THAT WE CAN FIGHT OUR WAY OUT OF THE FLOOD CONTROL CALAMITY THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW. IS YOU KNOW I MEAN. IT GIVE ME AN IDEA OF WHAT YOU'RE THINKING GOING FORWARD GIVEN THIS THIS THE CURRENT BUDGET REQUESTS COMPARED TO THE TO YOUR REQUEST THAT YOU HAVE ON PREVENTION THE MAYBE I'M NOT UNDERSTANDING. YOU KNOW HOW WE'RE GOING TO HELP YOU GET A RESPONSE- THE TO THE THAT HAPPY PLACE WHERE WE DON'T WE HAVE ALL OUR FIRES AND THE CONTROL. WHAT WE WOULD LOVE TO GET TO THAT HAPPY PLACE I'M NO MISTER CHAIR WE CERTAINLY DON'T THINK THAT THAT THE STATE CAN CAN FIND ITS WAY OUT OF. THE CURRENT SITUATION WE ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH ALL THAT'S EEN MESSAGE FROM C. R. A. N. AND OTHERS TODAY IN TERMS OF THE IMPORTANCE. OF BALANCING FIRE SUPPRESSION WITH FIRE PREVENTION AND- FIRE PROTECTION- I THINK WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO TALK MORE ABOUT- THAT PROTECTION. IT IS SUPPOSED TO SUPPRESSION SO MUCH IN IN THE SENSE THAT THE A FIRE IN SOME CASES IS A GOOD THING AND THAT'S PART OF THE PREVENTION AND FORCED HEALTH- SIDE OF THINGS AND SO. THERE THERE IS NEED TO BE BALANCED BUT THE FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR PROTECTION SIDE OF THINGS IS REALLY ABOUT TRYING TO MAINTAIN EXISTING CAPACITY. I THINK IT'S BEEN KIND OF WELL DOCUMENTED NOT PARTY TO LEARN ALL THE DETAIL. THE CONDITIONS THAT OUR FIREFIGHTERS ARE DEALING WITH YEAR IN AND YEAR OUT. ARE JUST NOT SUSTAINABLE AND WE NEED TO DO SOME THINGS TO SUPPORT. THE FIREFIGHTERS SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN. EVEN JUST THE LEVEL OF. CAPACITY WE HAVE NOW. FOR FIRE PROTECTION- FROM FIRE PREVENTION STANDPOINT WE COMPLETELY AGREE THAT THIS IS A IT'S A LONG TERM. ISSUE IT'S SOMETHING WE'RE GOING TO THE STATE'S GOING TO HAVE BEEN WORKING ON FOR YEARS TO COME. OF THE WAY WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT IS THERE IS THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS YOU'RE WELL AWARE OF THE G. G. R. AFTER HE'S BEEN CAN CHOOSE THE APPROPRIATE NOW AS A PART OF LAST YEAR'S TRAILER BILL. EFFORTS SO THERE'S A DEGREE OF ONGOING FUNDING THERE AND THEN A LOT OF THESE PROGRAMS ARE THINGS THAT YOU KNOW. WE'RE WE'RE STILL TRYING TO GET A GOOD HANDLE I THINK. ON THE LEVEL OF FUNDING THAT'S NECESSARY TO SUSTAIN IT. THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR SCENERY DID A GOOD JOB TALKING ABOUT THE SPRINT VERSUS MARATHON. AND I MISS MORRIS REALLY WORK. TALK ABOUT THAT ANALOGY I THINK WERE LOOKING DOING. FIGURE OUT. WITH A COUPLE OF YEARS OF INVESTMENT AND THE OUTCOMES THAT COME FROM THAT AS WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR THAT. MEASURE THAT. THAT WE'LL GET A BETTER IDEA OF THE LEVEL SUSTAIN FUNDING THAT'S NECESSARY AN ON GOING BASIS. TO MEET OUR GOAL OF FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES ANNUALLY BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AND I'M GOING TO. HAPPEN IS I THINK IT CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS IN TRYING TO GET THEIR- INVESTMENTS IN THEIR WORK ON. ON THEIR SIDE WITH YOU KNOW THE NATIONAL FIVE THOUSAND ACRE FROM THEIR SIDE- I'VE AND SEEING. WHERE OUR CURRENT LEVEL OF FUNDING PLANS US AND BEING ABLE TO ASSESS WHAT REALLY IS THE TRUE BASELINE AMOUNT FUNDING THAT'S NEEDED NON GOING BASIS FOR FIRE PREVENTION. HIS CURRENT. BALANCE WE'RE TRYING TO STRIKE. ALL RIGHT BUT THERE'S JUST NO WE HAVE FOUR HUNDRED MILLION IN GENERAL FUND FOR ONE YEAR OR TWO YEARS EACH YEAR VERSUS. NINE HUNDRED MILLION FOREVER AND EVER SO THERE'S THAT THIS KRISTIN. WITH A RALLY- CAN YOU ENLIGHTEN US. FROM THE PROPOSAL BEFORE US. I YOU AGAIN- FOR LIKE IT'S PROVIDES INCOME- SO WE ALL DID OUR- ON WITH OUR- REPORT WE DIDN'T. ON AND THE VARIOUS MAJOR WHILE RESPONSE PROPOSAL THAT ARE IN THE BUDGET AGAIN THAT'S PRETTY AND IT'S VERY WELL SUMMARIZED IN YOUR AGENDA AND IT'S AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE. I'LL JUST SOME REASON OF OUR ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS AND WE PROVIDED BASICALLY AN OVERALL ISN'T OVERLY SHE'S REALLY JUST A CONSIDERATION AS WELL AS SOME SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS. ON THE INDIVIDUAL B. C. P. THAT YOU'RE HEARING AS PART OF THIS ITEM. THE OVERALL AND WE DEFINITELY THINK THAT ADDITIONAL RESPONSE CAPACITY YEAH MAKES SENSE WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF- VERY LARGE AND SEVERE WILDFIRES IN RECENT YEARS WELL WE CAN'T FIRE FIGHTER WAY OUT OF THEM. THAT SEEM LIKE THIS IS AN AREA THAT THAT COULD USE SOME ADDITIONAL FOCUS. AND WE'VE CERTAINLY SEEN AS AS WAS MENTIONED- BY THE PREVIOUS SPEAKERS THE STRAIN THAT THESE FIRES HAVE CUT ON RESPONSE CAPACITY AND OUR FIREFIGHTERS. HOWEVER WE DO FIND OVERALL THAT THE PROPOSAL'S ON. DO YOU RESULT IN A VERY LARGE INCREASE IN THE BUDGET FOR THE BASE BUDGET FOR FIRE PROTECTION ROUGHLY 33% ROUGHLY A THIRD- FOR CALIFORNIA. I INVESTED THAT'S ON GOING ON AND THIS IS ON TOP OF REALLY SUBSTANTIAL INCREASES THE DEPARTMENT HAS SEEN IN RECENT YEARS ALREADY- INITIALLY CENTER CLEAR TO US THE EXTENT TO WHICH SOME OF THESE PROPOSALS WOULD ENHANCE RESPONSE CAPACITY AND OVER WHAT TIME FRAME AND WE THINK THOSE ARE REALLY IMPOTANT QUESTIONS OF THE LEGISLATURE CAN MAKE SURE IT'S GETTING. KIND OF MOST FOR ITS DOLLARS. AND FINALLY WE THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT. FOR THE STATE TO HAVE THE STRATEGIC WILDFIRE PLAN TO GUIDE ITS FUNDING ALLOCATIONS- AND ASTHMA'S MENTIONED- YOU KNOW IN THIS CONVERSATION. ON THE LEGISLATURE DID TAKE SOME ACTIONS TO TRY TO GET THAT INFORMATION THIS- BY REQUIRING REPORT IS PART SOMEONE RECORDING LANGUAGE. AND NOW WE'RE SUPPOSED TO IDENTIFY RESPONSE CAPACITY GAPS COST EFFECTIVE APPROACHES AND GOALS FOR THE STATE I THINK THAT'S REALLY- WOULD BE REALLY VALUABLE STILL. ASSEMBLY REALLY ANY OTHER OF THAT PLANET IT'S ALL THAT CHALLENGING THE LEGISLATURE WE STAY THINK YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY. SO NEEDS TO MAKE DECISIONS- WE DO PROVIDE SOME SPACE. WHEN WE CAN GROUP PROPOSAL. I KNOW THERE ARE A LOT OF THEM IT'S HARD TO IT'S- HARD TO. OF KEEP TRACK OF THEM- ALMOST AND I. KNOW THEIR- I IT'S A LOT IN WE TRIED TO GO. THEM HEALTH CLINIC A LITTLE BIT YOU. THERE'S THAT WE SUGGESTED RECKON ONES WE THOUGHT WERE RE. SO THAT WE ARE WE ARE COMMITTING WITHHOLDING. ON IT DOESN'T. THAT RELY ON FINDING AS WAS MENTIONED SPENDING WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF DETAILS ON THAT FOUR HUNDRED MILLION. AND I'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT AND THEN- THERE'S SOME INFORMATION WE RECOMMEND JOHNSON PROPOSAL VERY RECOMMEND HAVING DEPARTMENTS REPORTS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. CENTERS OF APPROVING- ONE THAT WE ARE COMMITTED PRETTY WITH A CONTRACT COUNTY PROPOSAL I DON'T THINK THERE AND THAT ONE MAY NOT OF BEEN SUMMARIZED FOR THAT. FOR THE COMMITTEE YEAH- BUT THAT ONE IS RELATED TO YOU FUNDING. YOU CAN CRUISE- IN THE CONTRACT COUNTIES AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT- YOU KNOW THAT THAT. THE. STATE HAS HISTORICALLY DONE. EXPAND THE STATE'S. ROLE IN FINDING. CRAZY THINK THAT. UNREASONABLE OF THE SCREENS FOR. TO MAKE SOME LAMP- FUNCTIONS FOR THE STATE ASSEMBLY. FIFTY WE THINK IT'S- READ. THAT FOR THE STATE OF OUR- SOME FUNDING THIS WITHHOLD ACTION BECAUSE THEY- TWO GROUPS OF PROPOSALS BECAUSE THEY- INTERACT WITH CORNER MILLION WE TALK ABOUT THEM JUST DON'T HAVE A LOT OF DETAIL. ON IT'S REALLY HARD TO. SORT OF GET OUR HEADS AROUND HIM. IT'S HARD TO SORT OF PROCESS- BECAUSE WE DON'T REALLY HAVE MUCH IN THE WAY DETAILS WERE EXPECTING THAT. HOPEFULLY IN THAT SPRING- BUT THOSE PROPOSALS INCLUDE THE EMERGENCY SEARCH CAPACITY PROPOSAL AS- FINANCE MENTIONS. THE ONE. RELATED TO YOU- YOU KNOW ITS ENGINES HELICOPTERS. AND OTHERS. AND THAT WAY AND THE STAFFING FOR THE HELICOPTERS IS INCLUDED IN THAT OTHER FOUR HUNDRED MILLION. I THINK ABOUT THOSE TOGETHER YEAH CAN I TAKE ACTION ON THE ON THE HELICOPTERS BEFORE YOU FIGURE OUT. HOW WE'RE NOT AND YOU KNOW THE FUNDING I'M KIND FOR STOPPING THEM. AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT IT'S A PARTICULARLY TOUGH ONE AND WE IN OUR MINDS TO IT REALLY. FAST WITHOUT THIS KIND OF STRATEGIC WELFARE PLAN. SO WE SIT WE RECOMMEND THAT YOU KNOW IT'S GOING TO TAKE YOU THINK ABOUT IT OPTIONS THE ULTIMATELY WANTS TO- FINDS THAT PROPOSAL COULD DO IT IN WHOLE OR IN PART. AND THEN THERE. ARE SOME ALTERNATIVES FOR EXAMPLE ONE POTENTIAL THING LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER IS. APPROVING SOME OF THE- SOME OF THEM RESOURCES NOW HOLDINGS I'M OFF ON SOME OF THEM CONTINGENT ON THAT REPORT- WEEKS. WE AND- I KNOW THAT FOR EXAMPLE THE HELICOPTERS WILL TAKE ABOUT A YEAR EACH TEAM. FOR THE STATE TO RECEIVE THEIR FOR. THAT ARE- THAT ARE BEING. PROPOSED AND SO YOU KNOW THAT WOULD NECESSARILY SLOW DOWN THE ACQUISITION OF THOSE BECAUSE IT'S GONNA TAKE US. TWO YEARS TO GET TO THE BOTTOM AND THEN FOUR YEARS TO GET FORM EITHER WAY- SO THE SECOND PROPONENTS ANSWER PROPOSAL. THANK YOU TO PROPOSALS- ARE THAT STATIC. THE CONSERVATION CORPS PROPOSALS. THOSE ONES ALSO ARE IN YOUR STANDING BASED ON PREVIOUS CONVERSATIONS IS THAT SOME OF THAT. THE STAFF TO SUPERVISE THOSE- CCC CREWS- ARE ALSO FUNDED AS PART OF A FOUR YEAR MILLION SAID IT WAS OUR UNDERSTANDING. UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THOSE ARE ALSO LINKED AND SO AGAIN THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW WHAT WE THINK IT'S PRETTY REASONABLE- FOR CCC TO HAVE. AND SOME ADDITIONAL PARKER CAPACITY THAT CAN PROVIDE SOME REALLY IMPORTANT BENEFITS. AGAIN WE CAN FOR YOU YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO THINK ABOUT THAT. IN THE CONTEXT OF THAT. FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR PROPOSAL. I AND REGARD TO THE PROPOSAL WE CAN GET THE- REPORT. IS MERITED. I'M ONE OF THEM IS THAT. AND I DON'T WE TO ABOUT THIS ONE AS WELL THAT PRIOR TO. SO PROPOSAL THAT PROVIDE. WHERE PROVIDE AND NEW. NEW A- AND SOME OTHER EQUIPMENT- AT TO A CAL. TRAINING CENTER- WE'RE RECOMMENDING REPORT- REQUIRING HEALTH CARE TO REPORT WHY DOES NEW TRAINING AND ARE NEEDED THAT IT APPEARS TO US THAT THE DEPARTMENT CAN USE RESERVE ENGINES ARE ENGINES THAT MIGHT BE SURPLUS OTHERWISE. I'M TO MEET THAT PURPOSE- WE THINK THAT DEPARTMENT SHOULD BE ABLE TO ARTICULATE THE SPECIFIC- CONSEQUENCES OF NOT HAVING NEW ENGINES FOR THAT NEED- ABSENT COMPLYING RATIONAL- REJECTING THOSE. ON THAT FIRE IS PROPOSAL AT THE WHEN AND YOU HEARD ABOUT FRIENDS- WE ASKED WE ARE RECOMMENDING THE LEGISLATURE DIRECT- YES AND TELL HER TO REPORT. FIND ALL DONE AN ALTERNATIVE PROPOSAL THAT WOULD FIND- THE PROGRAM ACT. BACK THROUGH THE LISTING LEVEL OF SERVICE AND UNDERSTANDING OF THE EXISTING LEVEL SERVICE ACTUALLY COVERS BOTH HERE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND ACTUALLY INCLUDES- TWO PLANES ALTHOUGH ONE OF THEM MS. OR ANYTHING OF THE TWELVE ARE COMMISSION WEDNESDAY TWENTY FOUR HOUR COVERAGE BUT I THINK THAT THE WAY THEY ARE ABLE TO SCHEDULE THEM IN SEQUENCE THAT THANK YOU ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE STATEWIDE COVERAGE- THAT'S BEEN REALLY BENEFICIAL TO THE STATE. I SO. THEY ARE MINE THERE IT'S- THAT DEPARTMENT HAVEN'T PROVIDE SUFFICIENT. AS TO WHY. THIS LIVE OF SERVICE. I'M WOULD BE NICE- PARTICULARLY GIVEN THAT THIS ALSO- ALREADY HAS ACT TO OTHER. TO OF TECHNO. FOR EXAMPLE MILITARY. WE CAN PROVIDE BOTH MANNED AND- AND I MANAGE- DROWNED COVERAGE. ON THAT SOMEWHAT SOME. AND THEN- ALSO WE NOTE THAT THE LEVEL COVERAGE WE EXPECT BE SICK. CHEAPER THE PROPOSAL FOR EXAMPLE IN THERE THAT WEREN'T COUNTY THEY THERE'S AN ESTIMATE ORANGE COUNTY COULD CONTINUE TO PROVIDE. EXISTING LEVEL OF SERVICE ROUGHLY SEVENTEEN MILLION DOLLARS WHICH IS A SUBSTANTIALLY LESS THAN THE THREE MILLION DOLLARS THAT'S PROPOSED. FINALLY ON THAT CADDY PROPOSAL AND HE TYLER- AND- MISTER TAYLOR MENTIONED. AS WELL THAT'S THE ONE AND- REGARDING YOUR PUTTING AND- CATENAE YELL ON THE REMAINING SLEEP RIGHT NOW IT'S JUST ON THE FRONTLINE- BATTERY THAT ABL IS ON THE FRONTLINE EQUIPMENT. ON THAT WOULD BE EXPANDED TO ALL THE FLEETS AND EXTRACT I'M TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED. RIGHT NOW TWENTY X. TWELVE HUNDRED TO GO TO ANOTHER TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY SIX HUNDRED. I NEED TO BE REPLACED EVERY FIVE YEARS AND ALSO REFRESHING- KEPT THEIR CAD SYSTEM AS WELL- ON THAT ONE RECOMMENDING THE DEPARTMENT REPORT ON THE BENEFIT. OF EXPANDING IT TO EVERY VEHICLE RIGHT SO NOT JUST THE FRONT LINE VEHICLES. BUT YOU KNOW EVERY CAR THEN ACTINIUM NOTE THE ADL'S ADDED WHEN YOU CARDS ARE PURCHASED SO I'M YOU KNOW THERE'S ACTUALLY GONNA BE EVERY FRESH AS PART OF THAT- REFRESH AND JUST WHEN YOU KNOW CARS ARE CHANGED OUT BECAUSE THEY GOT OLDER SO. IT'S NOT GOING TO ASK WHY- THAT REFRESH RATE WOULD BE NECESSARY AND- NO REALLY IT'S PRETTY EXPENSIVE ARE UNDERSTANDING IS THAT. IT'S MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER VEHICLE AND AGAIN IF YOU'RE EXPANDING IT- TO ANOTHER TWENTY FOUR SORRY ANOTHER TWELVE HUNDRED VEHICLES- AND THEN REFRESHING EVERY FIVE YEARS IT STARTS ADDING UP QUITE A BIT. SO WE THINK IT'S WORTH HAVING THE LEGISLATURE SEEING IT OPTIONS ON THAT AND REALLY UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE ADDITIONAL BENEFITS ARE- FOR BOTH EXPANDING IT- ALL OF THOSE VEHICLES AS WELL AS DOING THAT REFRESH RATE. SO THOSE ARE AT ARMS OVERALL AND I KNOW THAT WAS A LIE- COMPREHENSIVE- I KNOW THAT MY- HAVE QUESTIONS. I WAS REMISS AFTER NUMBER. I NEED TO- AND- THE PHONE AN AXE CODE SINCE. ARE NOT HAVING A TELEVISED OR VISUAL SCREEN SO THAT CALL IN NUMBER IS EIGHT FOUR FOUR TWO NINE ONE. SIX THREE SIX FOUR AN AX SIX CODE IS THIRTY FIVE. THIRTY ONE TWO EIGHT THREE CENTER DOLLY YOU HAVE A QUESTION. HE'S I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS ACTUALLY SO I WANT TO JUST BACK UP TO THE- THE FIGURES SO YOU THINK YOU CALL IT IS THE- RADIO SYSTEM. OUR TRACKING SYSTEM- AND I KNOW THAT- DIRECTOR GHILARDUCCI A COUPLE YEARS AGO WE DID THE NINE ONE ONE FEE WHICH WAS SUPPOSED TO IN REAL TIME BE ABLE TO DURING THE FIRES- COMMUNICATE WITH- PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY THROUGH THEIR PHONES- SO AND THAT'S A PART OF MONEY THAT IS. ANNUALLY COMING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS HOW- DO THESE TWO PROGRAMS WORK TOGETHER OR IS. THIS A LOT OF MONEY AND IT'S ALSO APPROPRIATED. OVER TIME IT'S NOT IT'S NOT GOING AWAY THE I'M CONCERNED ABOUT. HOW MANY HOW MANY VEHICLES ACTUALLY HAVE TO HAVE IT IN THERE AND IF IT COORDINATES WITH THE NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM THAT WE'RE UPGRADING AS WELL. AND THEN THE SECOND QUESTION WOULD BE- THE INMATE CREWS THAT WE HAVE- ARE DECLINING BECAUSE A PROP 47-57- AND WHAT'S THE AVAILABILITY OF GETTING THESE CREWS THAT- I KNOW THE SENATOR MCGUIRE AND I ARE WORKING ON TRYING TO GET SOME LEGISLATION TO- THEY BELIEVE PEOPLE ACTUALLY AND AT. TRAINED UP AND READY TO GO- FOR THIS FIRE SEASON. WOULD YOU LIKE TO TAKE THAT- CHIEF. CORYTON DIRECTOR YEAH HI GUYS MARC HERE SO THANKS FOR THE QUESTION I- I AM GOING TO- PICTURED OVERHEAD TO JOE BECAUSE THIS IS AN ISSUE WHERE THEY EIGHTY L. IT IS TIED INTO THEIR- CAD SYSTEM WHICH IS PART OF THE NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM- BUT IT'S A DIFFERENT THAT THAT IS A HARDWARE AND CAPABILITY- THAT IS NOT FUNDED THROUGH THE- THROUGH THE NIGHT AT ONE ONE- SET NOW FEET ENHANCEMENTS THAT THEN I WENT SENATE THE ENHANCEMENTS WHAT YOU'RE SPEAKING ABOUT- IS ENHANCING- THAN I WOULD WANT ITS IT'S- TEXTED NINE ONE ONE IT'S REFRESHING ALL THE- EQUIPMENT IT'S THE ABILITY TO HAVE- A BETTER. COMMUNICATIONS LINKAGE TO THE CADS EVENT OUT TO THE FIELD AND SO- THIS THE PROPOSAL THAT'S BEING REQUESTED HERE IS- AND UPGRADE OF THAT TECHNOLOGY IN THE CAD SYSTEM WHICH OUT ALTERED. OVER TO JOE. YEAH THANK YOU YOUR RECORD SHE- CENTERED ON MY- I THOUGHT THE FIRST QUESTIONS ARE T THE OTHER BY FROM BUT SPECIFIC ACADEMY L. IT IS REALLY AN ACCOUNT. TO AND- DYNAMIC DISPATCHING A TOOL THAT ALLOWS OUR EMERGENCY COMMAND CENTERS AND OUR INCIDENT COMMANDERS ON THE GROUND TO BE ABLE TO SEE WHERE OUR RESOURCES ARE CROSS CALIFORNIA. IT PROVIDES CRITICAL INFORMATION ON THE MOBILE DATA TERMINAL THAT IS INSIDE THE VEHICLE- THEY CAN- SEND INFORMATION PUSH TO WAY BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE COMMAND CENTERS AND- THE VEHICLES ON THE GROUND. AS I SAID EARLIER- IT WAS INCLUDED ONLY IN THE FRONTLINE VEHICLES BUT CAL FIRE SEES ITSELF AS A AS A TOTAL FORCE ORGANIZATION BETWEEN. THE OFFICE STATE FIRE MARSHAL- ARE RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM- ARE SUPPORT STAFF. AND AND FIRE PROTECTION AND SO OF THOSE PERSONNEL- WILL COME OUT OF THEIR OFFICES AND THEY WILL BE ONLINE AS WELL IN THOSE LATE MEDIAN UTILITY VEHICLES. THAT DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE CATTERY BL IN THEM- TO- TO BE ABLE TO- TRACK AS WELL- I HOPE THAT AND- YOUR QUESTION AS PART TO OF YOUR- WE DO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN- IN. THE INMATE FIREFIGHTING FORCE ACROSS. ACROSS CALIFORNIA WE'RE CURRENTLY WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION- UTILIZING THEIR SPRING POP REPORT TO EVALUATE. OPTIONS TO BOLSTER- ARE HAND CREWS AVAILABLE ACROSS CALIFORNIA WE DO THAT IN COORDINATION WITH CDC ARE WE WORK CLOSELY WITH- DIRECTOR SIDE- IN THE CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS- WE'RE WORKING WITH THE CALIFORNIA MILITARY DEPARTMENT- AS WELL AS OUR OWN FIREFIGHTER HAND CREWS TO TRY TO MAXIMIZE THE AVAILABILITY OF. RESOURCES ACROSS. THE STATE AVAILABLE TO THAT NOW SPECIFIC TO YOUR QUESTION ABOUT- A PROPOSAL- FOR MORE HAND CREWS- AT THIS POINT SO WE WOULD HOPE AND CONSIDER THAT- AS WE GO THROUGH THE SPRING- THE THAT- HAND CREWS WILL BE DISCUSSED. AS PART OF THAT FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. THANK YOU SENATE MCGUIRE. THANK YOU SO MUCH AS MISTER CHAIR IN NO QUESTIONS TO SOME COMMENTS REALLY QUICKLY AND OBVIOUSLY LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING IF THERE'S A COMING BACK FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINACE OR- ANY THE AGENCIES FIRST AND FOREMOST IS QUITE COMMON IN THE FIRES PROGRAM I THINK IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE MOVE FORWARD ON THAT AND OBVIOUSLY IT'S GOING TO HELP STATE AND LOCAL PARTNERS BUT I KNOW THAT'S GOING TO BE A AN ISSUE THAT WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE DISCUSSED APPRECIATE THAT. DIRECTOR BRING THAT FORWARD IN I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH THE CHAIR THAT WE CAN'T FIGHT OUR WAY OUT OF THIS CRISIS THAT RAIN IT'S GOING TO TAKE MULTIPLE STRATEGIES TO BE A TO COMBAT THIS CRISIS OF MEGA FIRES IN THE STATE BUT I ALSO AS- THE L. A. O. SAID WE NEED TO ENHANCE RESPONSE TIMES ACROSS THE STATE WHEN IT COMES TO CAL FIRE AND I'M NOT A BIG FAN OF TELLING STORIES BUT I TELL ONE THAT IS SIXTY SECONDS. AND IT HAPPENS ALMOST EVERY YEAR HERE DURING WILDFIRE SEASON WHETHER IT'S DIRECTOR PIMLOTT OR DIRECTOR PORTER. AND SENATE AGAIN STATION IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. AND THERE IS A COMMUNITY THAT IS THREATENED BY WILDFIRE. CALLING DIRECTOR PROMOTE INDIAN DIRECTOR PORTER. DURING THE WALBRIDGE FIRE THERE ARE NO FIREFIGHTERS AVAILABLE. COLIN DURING THE GLASS FIRE THERE ARE NO FIREFIGHTERS AVAILABLE CONDOM DURING THE TUBBS FIRE THERE WERE NO FIRES AVAILABLE. IN THIS STORY. THERE'S BEEN SO MANY TIMES IN THE STATE'S RECENT HISTORY OVER THE LAST DECADE WHERE CALLS HAVE BEEN MADE WHETHER IT'S HERE IN STATE. TO OUR NEIGHBORING WESTERN STATES AND FIREFIGHTERS SIMPLY AREN'T AVAILABLE BECAUSE THE SYSTEM IS TAPPED IN CALIFORNIA HAS THE GOLD STANDARD GOLD STANDARD OF FIREFIGHTING FORCES CALIFORNIA INTERVIEW JULIE SYSTEM BUT HERE'S MY FRUSTRATION. WE ALL KNOW IN WE'VE KNOWN. FOR YEARS NOW THAT CAL FIRE IS AND STEPPED UP TO MEET THE DANGEROUS REALITY THAT THE STATE FACES WITH WILDFIRES. YET WE CONTINUE TO PUT BANDAIDS ON A PROBLEM ON A PROBLEM THAT IS A GAPING WOND. SO LET'S TALK ABOUT STAFFING UNITED STATES FOR SERVICE RIGHT NOW EVERY YEAR HAS AT LEAST THREE PEOPLE ON THE RANGE AT LEAST THREE. MOST MUNICIPAL DEPARTMENTS MOST FIRE DISTRICTS HAVE AT LEAST THREE PEOPLE PER ENGINE. THE VAST MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIANS FLEE THEY HAVE MAYBE TWO AND A HALF TWO POINT SEVEN. DO WE PASSED A FEW YEARS AGO A COUPLE YEARS AGO. THIRTEEN ENGINES THIRTEEN ENGINES OUT OF CAL FIRE HAS THREE POINT ONE ONE STAFF. THIRTEEN NOW WE WANNA DIG INTO THE DETAILS THERE'S ABOUT THREE EARNED FORTY TO THREE HUNDRED FIFTY ENGINES THAT DON'T TO TWO POINT SEVEN. NOW THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE BROUGHT FOR THE PROPOSAL TO BE ABLE TO HIRE ADDITIONAL OFFICER POSITIONS BUT WE FUNDED ONE YEAR OF THAT ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY TWO. WE STILL NEED BETWEEN FOUR HUNDRED AND FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY TO BE ABLE TO GET TO RELEASE STAFFING. NEEDS ARE JUST OFFICER POSITIONS. YET WE CONTINUE TO CELEBRATE LIKE WE DID LAST YEAR THE HIRING OF TWELVE HUNDRED SEASONAL POSITIONS FOR HAND CREWS. THAT'S GREAT. BUT IT'S A HEADLINE AND IT'S NOT TELLING THE TRUTH STORY ABOUT THE CAL FIRE FIREFIGHTER SHORTAGE. THE REAL STORY IS THIS. WERE SHORT OVER FOUR HUNDRED. OFFICER POSITIONS TO BE ABLE TO GET TO OVER THREE- STAFFING ON ENGINES. NUMBER TWO OVER THE LAST DECADE THE REAL STORIES THIS WEEK LOS FOUR THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED INMATE. INMATES IN FIRE CREWS. AND WE HAVEN'T MADE HIM UP YET. YEAH WE SHOULD CELEBRATE TWELVE HUNDRED SEASONAL FIREFIGHTERS BUT- IT'S NOT GOING TO DO THE JOB WITH THE REALITY THAT WE ALL LIVE IN. WE NEED IMMEDIATE INVESTMENT WE NEED AN IMMEDIATE SIXTEEN HAND CREWS LIKE WE DID LAST YEAR WE NEED TO DOUBLE WHAT THIS YEAR. EACH OF THOSE HAVE FORTY EIGHT FIREFIGHTERS. WE NEED ENGINES UP TO FULL STAFFING JUST LIKE OUR FEDERAL SISTERS AND BROTHERS ALONG WITH OUR MUNICIPAL AGENCIES. AND- AND I'LL JUST SAY THIS. IT'S ABOUT RESPONSE TIME BUT IT'S ALSO ABOUT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF FIREFIGHTERS. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT NO ONE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT. BUT WE NEED TO BE OPEN AND HONEST AND BLUNT ABOUT HAVE YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR IT'S PUTTING THE HEALTH AND SAFETY FIREFIGHTERS AT RISK. THEY'RE WORKING FORTY DAYS IN A ROW FIFTY DAYS IN A ROW THAT A SINGLE DAY OFF. THEIR DEPLOYED AN INCREDIBLY DRAMATIC POSITION AT CONDITIONS YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR AND BY THE WAY I'VE SAT ON THIS COMMITTEE. GOD I DON'T KNOW FOUR YEARS FIVE YEARS AND WE STILL KEEP TALKING ABOUT WHAT WE NEED FOR FIREFIGHTERS AND NOTHING'S ENOUGH. WE CAN'T DO ONE WITHOUT THE OTHER WE GOTTA FONG WE HAVE TO FIND A AS THE DETERMINE HAS SO ELOQUENTLY STATED IN HIS LEAD THIS LEGISLATURE WE HAVE TO FIND. PREVENTIVE MEASURES AND WE HAVE TO FIND ENHANCE STAFFING FOR CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA FIREFIGHTERS. THIS IS AN AWFUL CALIFORNIA FIREFIGHTERS ARE THE LAST FOUR YEARS TO MEET FIFTY FOUR THOUSAND MENTAL HEALTH CALLS. FIFTY FOUR THOUSAND MENTAL HEALTH COSTS. LAST YEAR WAS THE FIRST YEAR IN THIS NATION'S HISTORY. WHERE SUICIDE THE COUNTIES. YET YEAR AFTER YEAR WE TALK ABOUT THE NEED FOR MORE FIREFIGHTERS. TURN OFF IS ENOUGH. WE GOT TO START TALKING ABOUT THE REAL STORY WE GOT TO BE OPEN AND HONEST ABOUT IT NOW AND I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS FOUR HUNDRED MILLION IT'S- TO BE DETERMINED IN THE BUDGET. LOOK THIS FOUR HUNDRED MILLION I'M WORRIED THIS FOUR HUNDRED MILLION THERE IS YET TO BE ALLOCATED SET ASIDE IT'S GOING TO GO I THINK TO BE GOING DOWN FROM SEVENTY TWO HOURS A FIFTY SIX HOURS PER CALIFORNIA FIREFIGHTERS THAT'S GREAT. BUT THAT'S NOT GOING TO LEAVE ANY ROOM FOR ANY ADDITIONAL POSITIONS IT'S SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH NINE INTER RIGHT HERE IN MISTER CHAIR YOU HAVE BEEN SO WONDERFUL TO LET ME TALK AND I'M SORRY BOTTOM LINE. NUMBER ONE RATHER THAN JUST PUT HER FNGER IN THE AIR EVERY FREAKING YEAR AND START FIGURING OUT WHAT WE NEED TO DO WHEN IT COMES TO STAFFING. WE NEED A STAFFING PLAN THIS LEGISLATURE NEEDS A STAFFING PLAN WHEN IT COMES TO CATCH FIRE WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO TO BE ABLE TO MEET THE REALITY THAT WE'RE FACING RIGHT NOW. FOURTEEN THE LARGEST TWENTY WILDFIRES HAVE HIT THE STATE IN THE LAST DECADE THIRTY BILLION IN INSURED LOSSES HAVE HIT THE STATE IN TWENTY. FIRE SEASONS COMBINED. IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT RESPONSE IT ALSO HAVE TO BE HAS TO BE ABOUT PREVENTION WE CAN'T DO ONE WITHOUT THE OTHER. IN WILDFIRES ARE CHANGING THE WAY THAT THIS STATE LIVES NEVER BEFORE IN MY LIFETIME HAVE KIDS HAD TO BE OUT OF SCHOOL FOR WEEKS ON END DUE TO SMOKE DAIS. THIS REALITIES GOING TO GET WORSE. AND IT SHAME ON US IF WE DON'T MOVE PROACTIVELY TO BE ABLE TO CHANGE YOUR RESPONSE TIMES TO BE ABLE TO ADD ADDITIONAL FIREFIGHTERS AND CONTINUE TO INVEST IN PREVENTION. AND I WOULD HOPE THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET THERE IN THIS BUDGET- AND I WOULD ASK. THAT BOTH THE ADMINISTRATION AND OBVIOUSLY THE LEGISLATURE WORK TOGETHER NOT JUST ON EASONAL FIREFIGHTERS BUT ACTUALLY GOING TO WHAT THE FEDS IN OUR LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES HAVE BEEN. FOCUSED ON IN THAT'S GOING TO THREE PEOPLE PER FIRE ENGINE IN THANK YOU SO MUCH. RESEARCHER THUNDERSTORMS EVER QUESTION. I DO JUST BRIEFLY GO AS EXTENSIVE AS LAST. I GOT CANNELLA. JOHN YEAH I HAVE NO LIFE OKAY I'M ON THANK YOU- I WOULD I CAN'T STATE ANY MORE ELOQUENTLY THAN. THAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM NORTH JUST DID SO. OUT OF HIS BOTTOM LINE IS HEARD- HURTING BECAUSE WE'RE OPERATING IN A MINDSET OF SCARCITY- IN A TIME OF ABUNDANCE AND WE DON'T NEED TO. SHORTCHANGE MARC COMMUNITIES OR OR THE BRAVE WOMEN AND MEN WHO FIGHT THESE FIRES- I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S ACTUALLY A NUMBER I SAW ON OUR ANALYSIS THEY WERE. I THINK IT'S SEVENTY NINE HUNDRED CALLS THAT WERE NOT ANSWERED IN TWENTY TWENTY. C. MINISTRATION OF A NUMBER OF. THAT THAT NUMBER FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE HOW MANY CALLS WERE NOT ANSWERED. ACTING CHIEF FIVE TYLER DO YOU HAVE A NUMBER ON THAT ACCOUNT FOR. CALLS THAT WERE ANSWERED IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THE SENATOR STERN- THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- RELATED TO SEVENTY NINE HUNDRED CALLS UNANSWERED BE REFERRING TO EMERGENCY RESPONSES ARE UNABLE TO FILL REQUESTS. HERE IT SAYS IN OUR ANALYSIS HERE- AND YOUR DATA ROUGHLY SEVEN HUNDRED QUEST FOR FIRE ENGINES NINE HUNDRED QUEST FOR DOZERS SIX AND REQUEST FOR HELICOPTERS COULD NOT BE ILLED SO I JUST WONDERED IF. WE HAD AN UPDATE- HOW LAST YEAR WAS LOOKING ON THAT FRONT. I WILL CERTAINLY I KNOW THAT STAFF HAVE BEEN WORKING OUT I WILL CERTAINLY GET THAT GRAPH FOR YOU AND- HAVE A SENT OVER. OKAY THANK YOU- I CAN I FOLLOW UP ALSO I DON'T KNOW IF THIS. GOES BACK TO CAL FIRE- YES. BUT- I WANTED TO GIVE A CHANCE FOR YOU ALL TO DEFEND- THE PROPOSALS ON- THE MUTUAL AID FIRE FLEET- AS WELL AS SOME OF THIS EMERGENCY SURGE CAPACITY- YOU KNOW WE DISCUSS SOME OF THE OTHER ISSUES BUT- IF ANYONE WANTS TO COMMENT ON THOSE ITEMS- AND EXACTLY HOW THEY FUNCTION LIKE IF WE DIDN'T HAVE- THIS MUTUAL AID FLEET- HOW WOULD THAT IMPACT THE STATE- IN ITS ABSENCES THE SAME WITH THE SURGE CAPACITY. ERECTOR GHILARDUCCI IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THE MUTUAL AID FOR WEEKS AND THEN I WILL TAKE THE SURGE CAPACITY. SOUNDS GOOD JOE THANKS SO THANKS FOR THE QUESTION- SO THAT THE- YES FIRE FLEET- WHICH IS A- A SYSTEM THAT WAS PUT IN PLACE IN NINETEEN FIFTIES- REALLY WAS A POST. COLD WAR- SORT OF. INITIATIVE TO ENSURE BACK BEYOND ANY EMERGENCY OR DISASTER. THAT WOULD BEFALL THE STATE. WHERE WE WOULD HAVE IMPACTS TO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND THEY WERE RESPONDING ACCORDINGLY THAT- FOR ALL HAZARD SITUATIONS WHETHER IT BE EARTHQUAKE OR FIRE OR FLOOD- OR ACT OF TERRORISM- THAT WE WOULD HAVE. AN ADDITIONAL CAPACITY TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND AND SUPPORT OF THE OPERATION NOW THE UNIQUE THIS PARTICULAR PROGRAM I DON'T HAVE- AFTER SO BUT I USE IT ALL THE TIME JUST YOU KNOW. BIRDS YEAH. I THINK SHOULD BE OUT OF MY CAR YEAH I THINK WAS ON ZOOM THEIR DIRECTOR BUT IT OVERSEE THE UNIQUENESS OF THIS PROGRAM IS THAT- WHAT WE DO IS WE TAKE THESE ENGINES ARE ALL RISK ALL HAZARD ENGINES CAPABLE OF RESPONDING TO ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF EVENTS AND THROUGH A PARTNERSHIP WE ASSIGN THEM TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT FIRE DEPARTMENTS SO BASICALLY THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT STATION WE HAVE AN AGREEMENT LOCAL GOVERNMENT LOCAL GOVERNMENT CAN USE THE ENGINE AS A SECONDARY ENGINE IF THEY NEED TO PART LOCAL RESPONSE BUT IN ESSENCE WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT WHEN I'M DISASTER OR EMERGENCY OCCURS THE STATE OF SIGNIFICANCE. WHAT WE NEED TO ACTIVATE THE MUTUAL AID SYSTEM THE ON ACTIVATING LOCAL GOVERNMENT FIRE UNITS WE ARE ALSO ACTIVATING THOSE- YES ENGINES AIRFORCE FORCE MULTIPLIER AND THE AGREEMENT IS THAT THERE THEN STAFFED WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT FIREFIGHTERS SO THEY BECOME NOW. QUOTE UNQUOTE THE STATE'S FIRE. SURE AND WE MOVED. AROUND THE STATE TO ADVANCE WHATEVER THEY ARE AND WE TYPICALLY REIMBURSE THOSE FIRE DEPARTMENTS FOR THEIR PERSONNEL ONLY WHEN WE USE THAT- AND WE REIMBURSE THEM THROUGH WHETHER IT'S THROUGH CDA OR THROUGH FEDERAL DISASTER FUNDS OR THROUGH. IF IN THE EVENT THAT THE RESPONDING TO A STATE RESPONSIBILITY OR YOUR FIRE I COULD BE IN THE KALIFORNIA A PROGRAM OR U. S. FOREST SERVICE. SO THERE'S A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS TO REIMBURSE THE FIREFIGHTERS WHEN THEY'RE DEPLOYED. BUT THE- BUT THE OVERALL PROGRAM WHICH IS- DOESN'T EXIST ANY OTHER PLACE IN THE WORLD- PROVIDERS WITH RESTORE NUMBER OF ENGINES. WE ARE. WE'RE. CURRENTLY HAVE ONE HUNDRED FOURTEEN TYPE ONE ENGINES SIXTY SEVEN TYPE THREE ENGINES SEVENTY NINE TYPE SIX ENGINES TWELVE WATER TENDERS CAN IN A HOST OF OTHER SUPPORT VEHICLES RIGHT AND THOSE ARE THOSE ARE DESIGNED ALL TO ADDRESS THAT THAT THE KINDS OF THREATS THAT WE HAVE WITH THE STATE AND THEN JUST FINALIZED A SAY. WE ROUTINELY DEPLOY EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE RESOURCES- AND IT'S GOTTEN TO THE POINT THAT WE ARE STILL SHORT. BEYOND NOT JUST THE- YES FLEET. BUT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT FIRE MUTUAL AID THAT IN MULTIPLE CASES SINCE AROUND. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THOUSAND FIFTEEN ACTUALLY MOVING FORWARD WE'VE HAD TO ROUTINELY GO OUT OF STATE FOR MORE RESOURCES. AND I THROUGH EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT ASSISTANCE COMPACT AND IN SOME CASES WE GOTTA GO INTERNATIONALLY- FOR ASSETS SO- I AM ALL ABOUT MEDICATION BECAUSE MEDICATION IS THAT IS THE WAY THAT WE BY DOWN THE REST. BUT TO GET THERE RIGHT NOW WE'RE KIND OF GOING TO A GUN FIGHT WITH A POCKET KNIFE AND WE NEED TO REALLY ENHANCE THAT CAPABILITY AND IN OUR CASE REALLY IT'S JUST MAINTAINING. A CAPABILITY THOUGH THEY WERE NOT ASKING FOR A NEW ENGINES WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR IS TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN THE FLEET THAT WE HAVE AND THEN AS THEY THEY NEED TO BE REPLACED- HAVE A REGULAR REPLACEMENT CYCLE WHICH IS BASED UPON. STANDARDS SET FORTH BY THE NATIONAL. FIRE PROTECTION ASSOCIATION AT FTA. SO WITH THAT I'LL TURN TO JOE. THANK YOU DIRECTOR AND SENATOR STERN THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY- UNDERSTANDING THE FLOW OF ISSUE TWENTY THERE WERE- BUT CHANGE PROPOSALS WE INVEST SO I APPRECIATE THIS OPPORTUNITY I SPECIFIC TO YOUR QUESTION OVERSEE SURGE CAPACITY IN RESPONSE ENHANCEMENTS. IN THIS PROPOSAL- CALIFORNIA IS REQUESTING FOR ADDITIONAL S. SEVENTY I. HELICOPTERS AS YOU RECALL THE LEGISLATURE IN THE ADMINISTRATION ARE GRACIOUS ENOUGH TO FIND A TWELVE HELICOPTERS SEVEN OF THOSE HELICOPTERS ARE CURRENTLY IN OPERATION- EIGHT THREE TWELVE ARE CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF BEING ACCEPTED AND DELIVERY ORDER BEING DELIVERED TO THE VENDOR- AND IS PART OF THAT PROPOSAL. WHILE ALL TWELVE OF THOSE HELICOPTERS WERE CAPABLE OF FLYING AT NIGHT FIVE OF THEM WERE STAFFED TO FLY AT NIGHT- SO THIS PROPOSAL AS THE ATLEO MENTION DOES TIE INTO- FOR THIS PARTICULAR PIECE AND A FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND THE REQUEST IS FOR ADDITIONAL S. SEVENTY I. HELICOPTERS AS SURGE CAPACITY DIFFERENT CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER CONDITIONS THAT WE CAN STAFF WITH ADDITIONAL PEOPLE. AS WELL AS HAVING THESE FOUR HELICOPTERS AVAILABLE AT AT AT MCCLELLAN PARK HERE IN SACRAMENTO TO BE ABLE TO SHARE THAT WE HAVE TWENTY FOUR SEVEN THREE SIXTY FIVE COVERAGE OF OUR BLACK HAWK HELICOPTERS AS WE BEGIN TO FLY AT NIGHT- AND IF WE WERE ABLE TO FLY AT NIGHT WITH ALL TEN HELICOPTERS HEALTHCARE IS. AVIATION OFFICERS BELIEVE THAT WE WOULD NEED THESE FOR ADDITIONAL HELICOPTERS TO ENSURE THAT TWENTY FOUR SEVEN COVERAGE WHEN THOSE AIRCRAFT COME IN FOR MAINTENANCE NOT ONLY IN THE WINTER BUT- DURING THE SUMMER WHEN THEY HIT CRITICAL- INSPECTION PERIODS. THE SECOND PIECE IS- AS WE CONTINUE TO AWAIT THE ARRIVAL WORKING BETWEEN THE VENDOR ON A FEDERAL CONTRACT WITH THE UNITED STATES AIRFORCE- WE LOOK FORWARD TO BEING ABLE TO AT A POINT IN TWENTY THREE- SEE THIS C. ONE THIRTY AIRCRAFT GOING TO SERVICE BUT IN THE INTERIM- CALIFORNIA IS PROPOSING TEN ADDITIONAL. EXCLUSIVE. USE PRIVATE CONTRACTED ERR AFTER A HUNDRED TWO FIFTY DAY CON. THAT WE ACROSS THE CALIPHATE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT- WILL. BE DISPATCHED ON INITIAL ATTACK WITH ANYWHERE FROM ONE THOUSAND TO TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED GALLONS OF WATER CAPABILITY WHEN DROPPING TO TRY TO REDUCE AND MITIGATE TO THOSE INITIAL ATTACK FIRES- LASTLY- AS IT RELATES TO A QUICK MEANT- WE'RE REQUESTING FIFTY FOUR. A SURGE FIRE ENGINES THE COULD BE STAFFED WITH ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL IT'S TO PER UNIT IN TWO IN EACH OF OUR SIX CONTRACT COUNTIES FOR A TOTAL OF FIFTY FOUR- THAT- THAT WE AGAIN COULD USE THOSE ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL TO STAFF UP AND HAVE ADDITIONAL ENGINES DURING CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER CONDITIONS- LASTLY- WAS AT TEN ADDITIONAL BULLDOZERS BULLDOZER TRANSPORTS AND BULLDOZER SERVICE UNITS- THAT CAN BE PLACED ACROSS THE STATE WE WOULD UTILIZE HEAVY FIRE EQUIPMENT OPERATORS. TO STAFF AND BE ABLE TO UTILIZE THOSE BULLDOZERS SPECIFICALLY- FOR THE PURPOSES OF- CUTTING LINE DIRECTOR INDIRECT ON FIRE LINES AS WELL AS- PROVIDING ADDITIONAL BULLDOZER SUPPORT AVAILABLE- ESPECIALLY IN THIS TIME OF REDUCED HAND CREWS ON HAND GRAVELLE ABILITY- THAT IS THE PROPOSAL FOR EMERGENCY SURGE. CAPACITY- EITHER SENATORS- CHAIR HOUSE- IF BUT YOU WOULD BE KIND- IF I COULD. TALK JUST BRIEFLY ABOUT THE TRAINING CENTERS IN THE CONTRACT COUNTIES HOLLYWOOD HERE DISCRETION IF YOU WANT NOW IS GOING TO BE MY FINAL QUESTION ACTIONS ON THE CONTRACT COUNTIES PIECE AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR- GOING FORWARD AND EXPANDING ON THAT WITHOUT EVEN- US PUSHING- BUT IF THE CHAIR WOULD INDULGES. IN MY COMMENTS FIND SORT WE HAVE WE DO HAVE TO MOVE ON TO GET AN OBVIOUSLY WERE INTERESTED IN THE ALLEY- POINTING OUT THAT NEW ENGINES. AT THE TRAINING CENTER WHETHER THAT'S- DESIRE. MAYBE IT'S DESIRABLE OUT I'LL GIVE YOU THAT IT TO THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF COOPERATIVE FIRE GABRIELLE I'VE BEEN OUT TO TALK ABOUT THE CONTRACT COUNTY. GOOD MORNING CARACAL THREE AS- MANY MEMBERS I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND TO- THE L. A. L. COMMENTS ABOUT THE NEED TO PURCHASE. A NEW ENGINES FOR OUR TRAINING CENTERS. OUR STUDENTS HAVE A WE BELIEVE THAT PURCHASE OF NEW EQUIPMENT IF NECESSARY OUR STUDENTS NEED TO BE TRAINED ON THE EXPORT IMPORT BANK WILL BE UTILIZING IN THE FIELD WHEN THEY GRADUATE FROM. THE ACADEMY OUR EMPLOYEES UTILIZE THESE ENGINES IN A LIVE FIRE TRAINING SCENARIOS WHILE THEY ARE AT THE TRAINING CENTER. AND IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT THEY HAVE A STATE SAVE OPERATING ENVIRONMENT TO LEARN THE REQUIRED SKILLS. THE REPURPOSED WE ARE TIRED INGENS- YEAH THAT COULD BE UTILIZED HAVE EXCEEDED CALPERS REPLACEMENT CYCLE THESE ENGINES ARE TYPICALLY TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE YEARS OLD AND MAY HAVE SEVERAL HUNDRED THOUSAND MILES ON THEM. THE ENGINES HAVE OLDER TECHNOLOGY AND DIFFERENT OPERATING SYSTEMS AND WHAT OUR EMPLOYEES WILL BE OPERATING WHEN THEY GRADUATE. FROM THE TRAINING CENTERS. I'VE DEALT WITH HIGHER ENGINES ALSO REQUIRE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE TO KEEP THEM IN SERVICE THANK JACKSON DO NOT STAND UP AGAINST THE RIGOROUS DEMANDS OF THE TRAINING ENVIRONMENT. WHERE WE HAVE AN EXPERIENCED OPERATORS LOGGING MORE HOURS ON THE EQUIPMENT DRIVING AND PUMPING BUT ARE TYPICAL. OF AN ENGINE IN THE FIELD. WE ALSO BELIEVE. THAT THESE ENGINES ARE NOT TO BECAUSE WE ARE MEETING DEMAND FOR TRAINING RIGHT NOW- WE NEED TO GET ENGINE THAT ARE CENTER. SO THAT WE CAN RUN CONCURRENT CLASSES AND REALLY MAKE UP FOR A-BACKLOG OF TRAINING THAT WE HAVE TODAY- THIS ONE TIME INVESTMENT WILL ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA HAS THE- APPOINTMENT NECESSARY. TO SAFELY AND EFFECTIVELY PROVIDE THE REQUIRED TRAINING AT TWO OF OUR STATE TRAINING CENTERS. I'M ABOUT OPENING FALLS ON. PRETTY GOOD THANKS FRED UP TONIGHT. I WOULDN'T SAY IT WAS AN ENJOYABLE READ ABOUT THE- CENTER TRAINING CENTER BUT IT WAS INFORMATIVE FIVE. FOR ME PART THAT WILL CLOSE OUT ISSUE NUMBER TWENTY STAFFORD CONDITIONS WE HOLD IT MATTERS OPEN THE SCHOOL THE ISSUE NUMBER TWENTY ONE WHICH IS THE LEGISLATURE IN S. B. TWO S. B. SIXTEEN AB TWENTY SIX AB FORTY EIGHT AND A PATH. FOR EIGHTY ONE HAS BEEN BUSY WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT PEACE OFFICER AND LAW ENFORCEMENT LEGISLATIVE REQUIREMENTS THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR CHIEF OF LAW ENFORCEMENT WITH THE- DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. DAVID YES THE- THE MIKE IS YOURS. MORNING THANK YOU SO MUCH. BEAR COMMITTEE MEMBERS CHIEF LAW ENFORCEMENT FOR THE DEPARTMENT. BUT TO GIVE YOU A BRIEF SUMMARY RELATIVE TO THIS BUDGET REQUEST FOR PEACE OFFICER LAW ENFORCEMENT LEGISLATIVE REQUIREMENTS THAT TOOK EFFECT JANUARY ONE. JUST A QUICK OVERVIEW AS YOU JUST READ SHARE WE'VE GOT SB TWO THAT WILL- DEPARTMENTS NEED TO COMPLY WITH WHICH EXPANDS THE AUTHORITY OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMISSION ON PEACE OFFICER STANDARDS AND TRAINING POST AS WE ALL KNOW WHAT TO INCLUDE ELIMINATING CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF QUALIFIED IMMUNITY FOR PEACE OFFICERS MORE EXTENSIVE INVESTIGATION PROCESSES AND A DECERTIFICATION PROCESS OF PEACE OFFICERS UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS- PARENTS MUST CONFIRM THAT ALL THE OFFICERS ARE. POST CERTIFIED REVIEW PEACE OFFICER INVESTIGATIONS AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CERTIFICATE SUSPENSION OR REVOCATION. RELATIVE TO SB SIXTEEN IT CONCERNS RELEASE OF RECORDS EXPANSE THE PIPE OF PEACE OFFICER RECORDS ACCESSIBLE THROUGH A PUBLIC RECORDS ACT REQUEST AND REVISES THE RECORD RETENTION PERIOD. AND PROCEDURES REPLACE THE FIVE YEAR MINIMUM WHICH CURRENTLY EXIST FOR THE FIFTEEN YEAR MINIMUM FOR SUSTAINED FINDINGS OF MISCONDUCT. ACCESS TO RECORDS TIME LINES AND- THE VOLUME OF THAT WORKLOAD- WILL HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT ON ON DEPARTMENTS. AB TWENTY SIX WHICH IS RELATIVELY USE OF FORCE AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION SEVEN TWO EIGHT SIX IT REQUIRES THAT OFFICERS IMMEDIATELY INTERSTATE REPORT WHEN I'M SERVING PERCEIVED EXCESSIVE FORCE- FROM OTHER OFFICERS- IT'LL EXPAND THE REQUIREMENTS FOR WITNESS OFFICER TO GO BEYOND REPORTING EXCESSIVE FORCE FROM WHAT AT ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS YOU CONSEQUENCES FOR AND OBSERVING OFFICER- IF THEY DON'T TAKE THE APPROPRIATE ACTION. AB FORTY EIGHT- HI SPECIFICALLY TO USE OF FORCE- REQUIRES- REPORTING COMPONENT THAT IS MONTHLY INSTEAD OF ANNUAL REPORTING. AND ADDRESSES SPECIFIED USED TO FORCE INSTANCES TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. AND THEN FINALLY AB FOUR EIGHT ONE. IT IS A REQUIREMENT THAT- LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WHO ACQUIRE EQUIPMENT THROUGH WHAT'S COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE TEN THIRTY THREE PROGRAM- JUST. CALLED MILITARY EQUIPMENT- HAVE TO REPORT THERE'S A FUNDING ACQUISITION AND USE REQUIREMENTS AND REQUIRES USE OF ALL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO OBTAIN APPROVAL FORUM THERE A PLUGGABLE GOVERNING BODY BEFORE THEY CAN REQUEST TO REQUIRE THAT THE TO ACQUIRED MILITARY EQUIPMENT AND THIS ALSO REQUIRES SIMILAR APPROVAL FROM DEPARTMENTS FOR THE CONTINUED USE OF MILITARY EQUIPMENT THAT THEY MAY HAVE ACQUIRED PRIOR TO JANUARY ONE. SUCH A BRIEF SYNOPSIS OF THE LEGISLATIVE- BILLS- INCLUDED IN THIS- ASK IS. PARDON OF FORESTRY AND FIRE PROTECTION CAL FIRE DEPARTMENT OF PARKS RECREATION STATE PARKS DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES WE'RE REQUESTING- THIRTEEN MILLION EIGHT HUNDRED AND FORTY NINE THOUSAND GENERAL FUND FOR THE FISCAL YEAR OF TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE AND EIGHT MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE THOUSAND ON GOING. THAT INCLUDES TWENTY EIGHT POSITIONS FOURTEEN VEHICLES TO COMPLY WITH THE PEACE OFFICER LAW ENFORCEMENT REQUIREMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE AFOREMENTIONED BILLS. ALL LEGISLATIVE MANDATES THAT ARE IMPORTANT. NEEDED TO PROVIDE TRANSPARENCY ON BEHALF OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. TO THE PUBLIC ON THEIR SH RESPECTIVE MISSIONS AND PUBLIC SAFETY. WITHOUT WE HAVEN'T TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. A DEPUTY DIRECTOR SWANSON AT CAL- YES DID YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO ADD. YEAH THANK YOU SENATOR- I JUST A MISTER BEST A GREAT JOB IN SUMMARIZING ALL THE- BCPS IN FRONT OF YOU WE HAVE ONE SPECIAL COMPONENT WITH AB FORTY ONE HERE AT- CALLAWAY S. I GUESS THIS IS THE BILL TO OBTAIN APPROVAL BUT LOCAL LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES NEED TO OBTAIN APPROVAL. FOR A COURT HEARING- SURPLUS MILITARY EQUIPMENT FROM THEIR GOVERNOR AND- BODY SUCH AS A- COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. BOB THIS BILL ESPECIALLY APPLIES TO US BECAUSE WE HAVE A ROLE IN OVERSEEING THE LAW ENFORCEMENT SUPPORT OFFICE PROGRAM OR THE TEN THIRTY THREE PROGRAM IS MR BEST SAID. BOB AND WHAT WE DO IS WE TAKE- APPLICATIONS FROM TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FOUR WALKING A BOMB FORCED AGENCIES. TO ACQUIRE SURPLUS PROPERTY- FROM- THE U. S. MILITARY AND A LOT OF THAT PROPERTY IS NOT WHAT YOU THINK OF THIS TRADITIONAL MILITARY PROPERTY IT'S OFFICE EQUIPMENT AND THAT KIND OF THING AS WELL. SO OFTEN COMPLIANCE WITH THIS BILL WHICH ASSETS ARE NOT ONLY THAT THEY GET- OBTAIN APPROVAL FROM THE GOVERNING BODY THAT ALSO WAS THAT THEY HOLD A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TRAINING THEY DO OTHER SORTS OF THINGS WE WERE GOING TO. MAKE SURE THAT THE- ENFORCEMENT OF. I TAKES PLACE WE HAD TO. BUT FOR THE APPLE TO THE AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS AS WELL HAVE A COMMENT. WE DO THANK YOU SO MUCH- THREE DO YOU THINK IT'S REASONABLE CERTAINLY FOR DEPARTMENTS TO REQUEST RESOURCES TO IMPLEMENT- THOSE PIECES OF LEGISLATION YOU HEARD ABOUT THERE ARE SEVERAL AS PART OF A STAFF PROPOSAL I'M BUT WE HAVE IDENTIFIED SOME INITIAL CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSAL OF ARE STILL. IN THE PROCESS OF REVIEWING IT- SO SPECIFICALLY TO THE- YEAH COMPONENT- WE'VE IDENTIFIED THAT THE RELEVANT BILL WHICH I'M AS WAS MENTIONED IS AB FOUR EIGHTY ONE AND IT REQUIRES LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT MANY AGENCIES TO OBTAIN APPROVAL FROM THE LOCAL GOVERNING BODY BEFORE ACCEPTING THE EQUIPMENT FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND IT DOESN'T AS AS WE READ IT SPECIFICALLY REQUIRE- YES TO VERIFY THAT THOSE AGENCIES RECEIVE SUCH AN APPROVAL SO- AS SUCH IT'S NOT CLEAR TO US THAT THE PROPOSED RESOURCES FOR- YES ARE NECESSARY TO IMPLEMENT THE LEGISLATION. AS ENVISIONED BY THE LEGISLATURE I'M ANYBODY HURT THE OTHER COMPONENTS WERE STILL REVIEWING THEM AND YOU KNOW AS AS WAS MENTIONED THERE SEVERAL DEPARTMENTS- COMPARISON THERE ARE. RECEIVE RESOURCE WORST REVIEWING THE TO SEE IF REALLY THAT THE APPROACH THAT APPEARS THE PURCHASE MAYBE. DIFFERENT ACROSS DEPARTMENTS WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT- THAT WE ARE ABLE TO FULLY ASSESS WHETHER THEY'RE TAKING SURVEYS CONSISTENT APPROACHES. AND THAT RESOURCES ARE APPROPRIATELY LIMITED AM ACTING LET IT TERMINATE CASES WHEN THEY'RE SHORT TERM WORKLOAD FOR EXAMPLE- AND SO WELL WILL PROVIDE ANY FURTHER ANALYSIS WE HAVE- AT THAT'S AVAILABLE. IF YOU HAVE ANY IDEA AND THE FOURTEEN VEHICLES I MEAN I GET THE ADDITIONAL TRAINING AND DISCLOSURE OF THE PEOPLE BUT ON THE FOURTEEN VEHICLES- HE HAVE ANY. INFORMATION TO HELP US OUT ON. YEAH AND I THINK THIS IS EVEN A BROADER I KNOW AT LEAST ON THE CAL FIRE SIDE THIS IS A BROADER ISSUE THAT- WE'VE THOUGHT ABOUT IN THE PAST AS WELL BECAUSE OFTEN THERE ARE. YOU KNOW BE A LOT NUMBER VEHICLES REQUESTED AND THEN AND ALSO YEAH DGS SHORT TERM AND- WE SAY THAN EVEN ADVANCE OF THOSE VEHICLES THAT'S ANOTHER AREA THAT I THINK WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO YOU- LOOK AT A LITTLE BIT MORE TO MAKE SURE THAT- THAT REALLY THEY'RE ALL AND MERITED BUT IT'S I THINK IT'S AN ISSUE CERTAINLY WITH REGARD TO THIS ARE THE ESSENTIAL CHAMPIONING THESE PIECES OF LEGISLATION AS WELL AS- I THINK THERE IS- YOU KNOW THE- EXTENSION. THAT WE'RE AWARE OF JUST TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT- WE'RE REALLY CAREFUL AND ALLOCATING AND PROVIDING RESOURCES FOR VEHICLES WILL CERTAINLY WITH T. THE PRESENTATION- IN THE STAFF REPORT IN THE SEEING ALL THE BILL'S LINED UP TO THE GATHER AND MONTHLY REPORTING AND THIS ONE AND FULL DISCLOSURE AT LEAST AN INTERPRETATION. THAT THERE MIGHT THROUGH SORT OF A CALL FOR NECESSARY BUDGET TRAILER LANGUAGE BUT I'LL LEAVE THAT FOR DIFFERENT DISCUSSION ON WHAT WE'RE GOING TO- QUESTIONS ON ISSUE NUMBER TWENTY ONE ON THE PEACE OFFICERS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT- THE LEGISLATIVE REQUIREMENTS. THIS IS OUR WORK. OKAY SEEING THEIR QUEST. WE'RE GONNA HOLD OVER WE HAVE SCHOOL WILL COMMUNICATING WITH US THAT ON THAT. FIELD NOW I WILL. BUT THOSE ARE ALL THE ISSUES BEFORE SO LET ME REPEAT FEE. THE ACCESS THE CALL IN NUMBER IS. IS. THIRTY FIVE. THIRTY ONE TWO THREE THREE AND NOW WILL GO TO- OUR PUBLIC HEARING WE HAVE MEMBERS HERE IN ROOM FORTY TWO OH THREE AT THE STATE CAPITOL. OUR FEWER RECOGNIZED MISMATCH MAKAYLA. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I ASSUME ONE MINUTE LIMITATION ON PUBLIC COMMENT PICK WHAT YOU NEED TO HAVE A FIRE IF YOU GO ON IF YOU ABUSE IT I'LL CALL YOU OFF AS A WILL THE OTHER GENTLEMAN HERE WILL KEEP IT SHORT WE ARE FREE US OUR CHRISTMAS CEILIDH ON BEHALF OF HUMBOLDT MENDOCINO REDWOOD COMPANIES WE APPRECIATE. YOUR LEADERSHIP- AND THE SUB COMMITTEE TO- LAST YEAR IN PARTICULAR BUT ON WILD FIRES FOREST FIRE FUNDING WE APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS FROM THE SECRETARY CROWFOOT AND DEPUTY SECRETARY MORRIS- WERE PLEASED TO SEE THE FUNDING GOING OUT TO THOSE PROGRAMS I THINK IT LEADS TO THE LOGICAL CONCLUSION THAT WE ACTUALLY NEED MORE FUNDING AND MORE PROJECTS TO BE DONE ESPECIALLY IF WE GO AFTER THAT. FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES ON THE STATEWIDE BASIS A MILLION- TOGETHER WE WOULD NOTE SIMILAR STATISTICS TO THAT WHICH A CERTAIN MCGUIRE SAID ABOUT THE SUBSTANTIAL MULTI BILLION DOLLAR ANNUAL LOSSES INSURABLE LOSSES THE AMOUNT OF ACREAGE THAT HAS BEEN- BURNED REPEATEDLY IT GOES TO TWO MAIN POINTS I WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH THE FIRST IS THAT. OUR CLIENTS STRONGLY BELIEVES THAT THERE SHOULD BE ONE PERSON IN CHARGE TO REALLY FOCUS ATTENTION ON ACHIEVING THAT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND STATE ACRES BE DONE ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND HAVE SUBSTANTIAL STATUTORY AUTHORITY IN SUCH A POSITION THE OTHER IS I WANT TO ECHO SOME OF THE POINTS THAT- CENTER DALLY MADE RELATED TO BIOMASS. OUR ESTIMATES IN CALIFORNIA TO ACHIEVE THAT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND- TREATED ACRES ANNUALLY WILL ACTUALLY NEED SOMETHING IN THE RANGE OF ABOUT TWO HUNDRED MILLION ANNUALLY FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE TO ADDRESS. THAT THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN. ZACKS TOURNAMENT THERE'S A NUMBER MISTER CHAIRMAN TERRY MCHALE WITH ERIN REED ASSOCIATES REPRESENTING CAL FIRE LOCAL TWO EIGHT EIGHT ONE FIRST I WANTED TO MENTION A CERTAIN ACQUIRES IMPASSIONED SPEECH ABOUT THE NECESSITY TO ENHANCE STAFFING FOR FIREFIGHTERS. THAT SPEECH WHICH WAS SO FIERY WAS ALSO PROMISED ON THE TRUTH. HE WAS THERE WHEN CAPTAIN FROM CAL FIRE MENTIONED THAT SHE AND HER HUSBAND WHO BOTH WORK FOR CAL FIRE HAD TO WORK SIXTY STRAIGHT DAYS LAST SUMMER. AND AS A RESULT HAD TO BRING THEIR MOTHER IN TO HELP RAISE THEIR CHILDREN. THE DEMANDS ON CALIFORNIA THE LAST FOUR YEARS IT'S BEEN EXTRAORDINARILY ONEROUS AND I'M PLEASED TO SEE THAT THEY NEED TO HELP THEM IS RESONATING ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE. PLEASE ALSO AT THE GOVERNOR SET ASIDE THAT THAT- FOUR HUNDRED MILLION. AND WOULD NOTE THAT SECRETARY CROWFOOT- DID GO TO SPEAK WITH THE FIREFIGHTERS AND ALSO PLEDGED HIS SUPPORT IN THAT ISSUE. THE ONE THING I WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE WITH HOWEVER IS TO NOTE. HOW FIREWORKS. TWO HOURS A WEEK AS OPPOSED TO FIFTY SIX HOURS PER OTHER FIREFIGHTERS. THE SEVENTY TWO HOURS WORK WEEK IS ALSO A MISNOMER. BECAUSE THEY MAKE IT ON THE ENGINE THE BEGINNING OF THE SEVENTY TWO HOURS. BUT THEY DON'T GET OFF FOR WEEKS AT A TIME. SO THE IDEA OF MOVING TO A FIFTY SIX HOUR WORK WEEK IS BEING RELIEF. WILL ONLY WORK IF WE HAVE MORE FIREFIGHTERS THE FIFTY SIX HOUR CHANGE OBVIOUSLY CANNOT WORK IF PERSONNEL IS NOT ENHANCED. AGAIN THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU. X. SIX. GOOD MORNING TERMINATE CUSTOMERS OF COMMITTEE PAUL MASON WITH PACIFIC FOREST TRUST I THANK YOU FOR A ROBUST DISCUSSION EARLIER ON THE WILDFIRE EXPENDITURE PROPOSAL AND FOR YOUR PAST AND FUTURE LEADERSHIP ON THIS TOPIC- I THINK YOU WERE CORRECT IN THE PAST WE'VE SUGGESTED A MULTI YEAR YOU KNOW FIVE BILLION DOLLARS OVER FIVE YEARS THAT SORT OF LEVEL OF ONGOING COMMITMENT IS WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO BRING RESILIENCE BACK TO THE LANDSCAPE- WHEN. THERE'S GONNA BE SOME OF THOSE PROGRAMS THAT WE KNOW NOW WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO BE STABLE AND ONGOING LIKE A FOREST HELTH GRANT PROGRAM IF THAT'S NOT SOMETHING WE CAN PREDICT YEAR OVER YEAR MAKES IT HARD TO BUILD MOMENTUM IN THAT INDUSTRY SO SOME PLACES WE'RE GONNA WANNA MAKE THOSE LONGER TERM COMMITMENTS AND OTHERS WHERE I THINK WE NEED TO LEARN MORE ABOUT SOME OF THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE STILL EARLY IN BEING SET UP. ONE AREA THAT WE REALLY NEED TO LEAN INTO IS GETTING MORE GOOD FIRE ON THE LANDSCAPE PRESCRIBED FIRE CULTURAL FIRE. AND REALLY RECOGNIZING THAT FIRES ALWAYS BEEN PART OF THE LANDSCAPE. THE PERVERSE OUTCOME OF LEANING TOO HARD ON SUPPRESSION. IS WERE SELECTING FOR THE MOST DAMAGING FIRES. THE FIRES THAT ARE BURNING UNDER LOWER INTENSITY UNDER. LESS EXTREME CONDITIONS QUALIFIERS RIGHT ON. ENORMOUS AN OUT OF CONTROL. WE CAN CONTROL THE TIMING. OF PRESCRIBED FIRE AND WE REALLY NEED TO USE THAT TO GET. MORE THE LANDSCAPING THAT RELY CONDITION LAST OBSERVATION WOULD BE THAT AS WE'RE LOOKING AT A MILLION ACRES A YEAR OF HABITAT MODIFICATION AND VEGETATION MANAGEMENT WE NEED TO INTEGRATE THAT WELL WITH OUR CLIMATE AND WATER AND BIODIVERSITY PLANNING AS WELL TO MAKE SURE GETTING GOOD OUTCOMES ACROSS THOSE- COMPLEMENTARY GOALS THE SHOULD BE THE ALL THE SAME SORTS OF OUTCOMES. AND PART OF THAT NEEDS TO BE LARGE CONTIGUOUS BURN A WHOLE LANDSCAPES WHERE WE'RE THERE ON FRAGMENTED BY ADDITIONAL DEVELOPMENT CONVERSION AND A CONDITION WORK FIRE WOULD NOT BE CATASTROPHE THE BURNING UNDER REASONABLE CONDITIONS SO THANK YOU LITTLE FOLLOWED WITH MORE DETAILS IN WRITING. THANK YOU THERE ARE NO OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC IN FORTY TWO OH THREE WISHING TO TESTIFY SO MODERATOR.

FIRST WE NEED TO INCREASE PROPOSED INVESTMENT IN A WELFARE PACKAGE ALONG THE LINE THAT. THAT THE CHAIR YOU THINK JEFF DID A BILLION OVER- EACH OVER FIVE YEARS IN PARTICULAR WE NEED TO INCREASE INVESTMENTS AND-PRESCRIBED FIRE CONSERVATION EFFORTS SUCH AS THOSE FUNDED BY THE FOURTH LEGACY PROGRAM AND W. C. B. CAPACITY BUILDING FOR TRIBES RCTS LANDRAT AND OTHER PARTNERS AND CLIENTS PARTICULARLY FINISHING THE FIND SKILLED EDUCATION MAPPING FOR THE STATE. SECOND I'D LIKE TO- HIGHLIGHT THAT WE'D LIKE TO SEE THE LEGISLATURE FOCUS ON IMPROVING MONITORING AND EVALUATION OF THE MARION OF BOARD AND FIRE PREVENTION PROGRAM PROJECTS NOT ONLY TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE COST EFFECTIVE WHICH IS SOMETHING THE ONLY- POINTED OUT BUT ALSO TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE NOT HAVING UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. SUCH AS RESULTING IN HIGH CONVERSION HABITAT DESTRUCTION AND DEGRADATION OF WATER QUALITY THAT'S BACK IN MONITORING AND EVALUATION IS NOT HAPPENING BEYOND THE ASSESSMENT OF CARBON REDUCTION AND IT'S KIND OF CRAZY TO BE INVESTING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND NOT CONDUCTING MONITORING AND EVALUATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL OUTCOMES PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU CONSIDER THAT CALIFORNIA HAS OTHER GOALS TO JUST THIRTY BY THIRTY AND BIODIVERSITY. PROTECTION THANK YOU. Q. NECK. WE WILL SEVEN ONE YOUR OPEN.
