ASSEMBLY MEMBER ALMOST WE WOULD INVITE YOU FOR. WITH. WE HAVE TO ESTABLISH A QUORUM FIRST BUT THEY I APPRECIATE YOUR EAGERNESS ASSEMBLY MEMBER. SAYS A PERSONAL INVITATION FOR ASSEMBLYMEMBER IRWIN TO COME JOIN US IN PRIVACY AND- THANK YOU FOR THE- MOTION AND A SECOND WHEN THE TIMES APPROPRIATE. I WANNA- THANK YOU- AND WOULD LIKE TO START OFF BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE AND STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US IN ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS LISTED AND THEN ALICE'S. FAT NON OPIOID OVERDOSES AND POISONINGS HAVE BEEN A SCOURGE IN OUR DISTRICTS. MANY OF THE VICTIMS ESPECIALLY WITH FAT NOW HAVE NO IDEA. OF THE POTENCY OF THE DRUGS WHICH IS MANY TIMES MORE POWERFUL THAN REGULAR OPIOIDS. NATIONALLY OVERDOSES ROSE FROM TWO THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND SIXTY SIX IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN TO A STARTLING AMOUNT OF 310-003-0030 FIVE IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. THE FEDERAL DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES REPORTED OVER EIGHTEEN THOUSAND OVERDOSES CAUSED BY FAT AND ALL IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN WITH THE RATE CONTINUING TO DOUBLE EACH YEAR. IN MEETING FIRSTHAND WITH PARENTS OF LOVED ONES WHO SUCCUMB TO FATTEN ALL. A COMMON TRAIT AROSE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS. THESE PLATFORMS ARE USED TO ADVERTISE IT MADE IT EASIER TO PURCHASE FATTEN ALL OVER THE INTERNET. WELL SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES HAVE INTRODUCED NEW POLICIES TO ADDRESS DRUG DISTRIBUTION THROUGH THEIR PLATFORMS THIS PRACTICE IS NOT WIDELY USE. GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY THAT ARISES ON SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS THERE SHOULD BE SOME REQUIREMENT FOR SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES TO POST THEIR POLICIES IN AN AREA WHERE PEOPLE CAN VIEW IT. AB SIXTEEN TWENTY EIGHT WOULD REQUIRE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS TO POST POLICIES REGARDING THEIR POLICY ON THE USE OF THE PLATFORM TO ILLEGALLY DISTRIBUTE IT DISTRIBUTE A CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE. THIS BILL SIXTEEN TWENTY EIGHT WOULD ALSO REQUIRE A LINK TO THE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS REPORTING MECHANISM FOR ILLEGAL OR HARMFUL CONTENT OR BEHAVIOR TO REPORT. WITH ME TODAY IS SERGEANT JULIUS MISMA CHRISTIAN ON BEHALF OF THE SAMBAR DINO SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MY NAME IS JULIE IS A CHRISTIAN AND I'M A SERGEANT REPRESENT A SALMON COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. FOR THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS THE UNITED STATES AND CALIFORNIA HAS EXPERIENCE OPEN FIELDS. RELATED EPIDEMIC THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN CUT COMPOUNDED BY THE INTRODUCTION OF FENTANYL AND ITS CURRENT COUNTERPOINTS COUNTERPARTS INTO THE DRUG MARKET. IT NOW HAS BEEN INTRODUCED IN HEROIN COCAINE METHAMPHETAMINE AND MARIJUANA. THAT KNOWLEDGE IS EXTREMELY POTENT AND THE FAST ACTING AND FAST ACTING IF INHALED OR INGESTED. A DAILY DOSE OF FIT NOW CAN BE USED AS LITTLE AS TWO MILLIGRAMS IS FIFTY TIMES MORE POWERFUL THAN HEROIN AND ONE HUNDRED TIMES STRONGER THAN MORPHINE. THERE HAVE BEEN MANY NOTABLE CASES OF INDIVIDUALS PURCHASING SUBSTANCES BELIEVING THEM TO BE COCAINE METHAMPHETAMINE OR PRESCRIPTION PILL ONLY FOR THAT SUBSTANCE TO BE LACED WITH DANGEROUS A DANGEROUS QUALITY. OF FIT ENOUGH THAT THE USER UNKNOWINGLY INGEST AVENUE THAT CONNECTS USERS AND DEALERS THROUGH FRIEND SUGGESTIONS. ASSEMBLY BILL SIXTEEN TWENTY EIGHT WOULD BE A MAJOR ACID IN RESTRICTING THIS ACTIVITY BY HAVING ALL ON ONLINE PLATFORMS CREATE A POLICY PROHIBITING THE USE OF THE PLATFORM. TO ILLEGALLY DISTRIBUTE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES CONFRONT THIS PROBLEM BY REQUIREMENTS SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS TO HAVE POLICIES PROHIBITING ILLEGAL ACTIVITY AND REPORTING PROCESSES PREVENTING pMEDIA. THIS WILL CREATE AN OVERSIGHT RELATIONSHIP WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFIE AND THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO ENSURE THAT POLICIES TO PREVENT SUCH ILLIQUID ILLEGAL ACTIVITY WERE IN PLACE AND WORKING AS A AS INTENDED. I WANNA SAY THANK YOU TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER RAMOS FOR YOUR SUPPORT IN THIS FIGHT AGAINST THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC AND HELPING US WE SEE THE TOOLS WE NEED TO SAVE LIVES. FOR THOSE REASONS I AM PLEASED TO SUPPORT AB. SIXTEEN TWENTY EIGHT AND AN URGENT IVEL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M JUST GOING TO.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS LET ME START BY ACCEPTING THE CHAIR SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS AND THANKS TO THE CONSULTANT FOR HIS WORK ON THIS BILL. UNDER EXISTING LAW PROPERTY MANAGERS MAY CHARGE UP TO FIFTY THREE DOLLARS AND THIRTY THREE CENTS PER SCREENING REPORT FOR PROSPECTIVE RENTER. DO THE CURRENT HOUSING CRISIS RENTERS OFTEN HAVE TO APPLY TO MULTIPLE PROPERTIES BEFORE THE APPLICATION IS ACCEPTED. IF A RENTER IS APPLYING TO SEVERAL PROPERTIES THE VARIOUS APPLICATION FEES CAN QUICKLY ADD UP TO SEVERAL HUNDRED DOLLARS. SO DO ADDRESSES FINANCIAL BERRIER HOUSING WE'RE LOOKING TO THE STATE OF WASHINGTON AND MARYLAND WHO PASSED LEGISLATION TO ALLOW LANDLORDS TO ACCEPT. REUSABLE SCREENING REPORTS THESE REPORTS ARE GENERATED BY A THIRD PARTY SCREENING REPORT PROVIDERS THAT WILL SECURELY GET GENERATE AND SHARE A CERTIFIED SCREENING REPORT WITH ANY PROSPECTIVE LANDLORD. AN APPLICANT AB TWO FIVE FIVE NINE CENTS A STATE STANDARD FOR REUSABLE SCREENING REPORTS TO BE USED DURING THE RENTAL APPLICATION PROCESS IF THE LANDLORD ELECTS. TO IT IF THE LANDLORD ELECTS TO ACCEPT SUCH A REPORT. BY USING A REUSABLE SCREENING SUPPORT RENTERS ONLY HAVE TO PAY A ONE TIME. FOR THE REPORT THAT CAN BE USED MANY TIMES OVER THIRTY DAY PERIOD THEREBY SAVING THE RENTER HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS A MORE ALLOW LANDLORDS. TO EXPEDITIOUSLY REVIEW VERIFIED APPLICANT INFORMATION I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR EITHER. WE HAVE A MOTION BY. SOME OF OUR QUE HANNAH SECOND BY- SWIMMER WILSON OUR DYNAMIC DUO IN THE CORNER OVER THERE- DO YOU HAVE ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT TODAY. NOT TODAY WONDERFUL I AND I AM I DO WANT TO ANNOUNCE THAT- WE HAD RECEIVED A LATE NOTICE OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION HAVE REALTORS HAS REMOVED THEIR OPPOSITION IS NOW NEUTRAL ON THE BILL. PLEASE WORK WITH THEM. THANK YOU FOR THAT OR IS THERE ANYONE IN THE HEARING IN THE COMMITTEE ROOM THAT WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS SUPPORT. ANYONE IN THE COULD HEARING ROOM I GUESS WE WILL TURN TO OPPOSITION DO WE HAVE ANY WITNESSES- IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. FROM SHORTER THAN THE LAST PERSON. I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE AND PRIVACY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK MY NAME IS KELLY WALTERS I AM A STAFF ATTORNEY WITH LEGAL SERVICES FOR PRISONERS WITH CHILDREN I'M HERE TODAY TO DISCUSS OUR OPPOSITION TO AB TWO FIVE FIVE NINE AS IT IS CURRENTLY WRITTEN. AS AN INITIAL MATTER WE GENERALLY FIND PORTABLE SCREENING REPORTS BENEFICIAL FOR TENANTS AND CONSUMERS ALIKE ADDITIONALLY WE STRONGLY SUPPORT LEGISLATION THAT REDUCES THE FINANCIAL BURDEN PLACED ON THOSE SIMPLY SEEKING A PLACE TO LIVE IN THEORY THIS BILL COULD BENEFIT THOSE SEEKING HOUSING BY ALLOWING THEM TO REUSE THEIR SCREENING REPORT MULTIPLE TIMES WITHIN THIRTY DAYS RATHER THAN PAYING ANOTHER FEE EACH TIME THEY APPLY FOR RENTAL. HOWEVER THE PROPOSED BILL DEFINES A REUSABLE TENANT SCREENING REPORT TO INCLUDE THE RESULTS FOR AN EXORBITANT AMOUNT OF TIME SPECIFICALLY IT PROVIDES A CRIMINAL AND EVICTION HISTORY FOR THE PRECEDING SEVEN YEARS SEVEN YEARS IS THE MAXIMUM LOOK BACK PERIOD ALLOWED UNDER STATE AND FEDERAL LAW. AS SUCH THE AUTHORS OF AB TWO FIVE FIVE NINE HAVE THE FREEDOM TO SIGNIFICANTLY LESS IN THIS LOOK BACK PERIOD. THE DANGER OF CODIFYING THIS UNNECESSARILY LONG LOOK BACK PERIOD COULD BE DEVASTATING TO ANYONE RECENTLY RELEASED FROM PRISON OR JAIL OR ANYONE WITH A CRIMINAL HISTORY WHICH WE ALL KNOW TO BE DISPROPORTIONATELY PEOPLE OF COLOR FURTHERMORE THIS BILL TO CENTER VISES LANDLORDS USE THE POTENTIALLY BENEFICIAL REUSABLE TENANT SCREENING REPORT. AB TWO FIVE FIVE NINE AS WRITTEN PUTS OBLIGATIONS ONLY ON THE LANDLORDS WHO USE THESE REPORTS TO PROVIDE THAT NOTICE. THIS BILL HAS THE POTENTIAL TO ELIMINATE UNNECESSARY COSTS FOR TENANTS BUT AS WRITTEN IT IS LIKELY TO DISCOURAGE LANDLORDS FROM USING THE PORTABLE SCREENING REPORTS. AND WILL HAVE A CHILLING EFFECT ON ANYONE WHO HAS BEEN EVICTED OR HAS A CRIMINAL HISTORY THAT EXTENDS BACK TO SEVEN YEARS. FURTHER IT WILL GIVE RISE TO VIOLATIONS OF THE EQUAL PROTECTION OF VARIOUS BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE ALL ACROSS THE STATE. DUE TO THESE POTENTIAL BENEFITS WE ARE BUT WE ARE VERY OPEN TO WORKING WITH THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER. TO WORKING WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER WARD'S OFFICE TO MAKE AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL THAT WOULD ELIMINATE THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON THESE TENANTS. BECAUSE OF ALL THESE REASONS WE REQUEST THAT YOU VOTE AGAINST THIS BILL AS WRITTEN. THANK YOU. THANK YOU TO OUR IN HOUSE IN THE COMMITTEE ROOM IN OPPOSITION. ALL RIGHT SEEN NONE LET'S GO AHEAD AND BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE WE HAVE A MOTION A SECOND OR THE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. TO OUR MARKET. I THINK THERE IS ONE OPPOSITION LETTER ON FILE. THEIR THEIR LIST OF THE- HI THEIR LIST AS PART OF A COALITION SUBMITTING THE LETTER. THERE ABOUT HOURS THANK YOU I'M JUST SOME CLARIFICATION SO IF I WERE A LANDLORD AND I HAVE BEEN A ONE HOUSE THAT I'M RENTING. AND I DON'T HAVE A WEBSITE WHAT I AND I CHOOSE TO USE THIS PROCESS. ONE WHAT I HAVE TO ABIDE BY THE REST OF THE CONTENTS AND IN MEANING IF I DON'T HAVE A WEBSITE HOW CAN I POST ON THE WEBSITE THAT THIS IS WHAT I'M ACCEPTING- VERSES THAT WOULD I JUST HAVE TO PUT ON LIKE A CRAIGSLIST POST AND WERE HOT. HOW WOULD WOULD I BE ABLE TO COMPLY IF I DON'T HAVE ALL OF THAT AND IF I DO IF IT DOESN'T MATCH THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL. THANK YOU- ASSEMBLY MEMBER THIS ISSUE HAS COME UP AND WE ARE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE EXPLICITLY CLEAR THAT THIS IS ELECTIVE- THAT- WE WANT TO MAKE IT EASY WE WANT TO INTRODUCE YOU KNOW THIS NEW IDEA. INTO A AN ALTERNATIVE WAY TO BE ABLE TO USE SOMETHING THAT WILL REDUCE COSTS FOR PROSPECTIVE RENTERS ALSO WOULD BE MORE READILY AVAILABLE TO OUR PERSPECTIVE LANDLORD AS WELL- AND WOULD WORK TO MAKE SURE THAT THE COMMUNICATION IS CLEAR BETWEEN. PROSPECTIVE LANDLORDS AND PROSPECTIVE TENANT ON YOUR EARLIER INTEREST IN ACCEPTING HIS AS WELL- WILL CONTINUE TO WORK- WITH OUR REALTORS IN THE APARTMENT SAYS HE SHOULD MAKE SURE THAT- THIS IS- PURELY ELECTIVE. I'M JUST A LITTLE CONCERNED ON HOW IT IMPACTS LIKE THE LITTLE GUY ESPECIALLY IF- I'M A LANDLORD AND I AM WILLING TO ACCEPT THIS- TYPE OF APP APPLICATION. AND FIND OUT AFTER A MONTH OR TWO OF USINGIT BUT IT'S JUST NOT WORKING FOR ME AND I HOW WOULD I PROVIDE CLARITY SO I'M NOT I DON'T FIND MYSELF IN LEGAL TROUBLE THE FOLLOWING ONE MOMENT WHEN I DECIDE THAT I DON'T WANT TO USE THIS. AND THE STATUTE OF A WRITING UNDER THIS BILL WOULD AGAIN CONTINUE ALLOW YOU THE FLEXIBILITY FOR HAVING ELECTED TO BE GRATEFUL IF YOU WOULD AS A LANDLORD CONSIDER THAT- OF COURSE WE WANT TO TRY TO PUT MORE OPTIONS OUT THERE FOR PERSPECTIVE RENTERS- BUT WE ALSO WANT TO INTRODUCE. A WAY THAT DOES NOT HAVE AN INTENDED CONSEQUENCES. WERE PENALIZED. ANY PARTICIPANTS. IT ALL JUST I THINK YOU MUCH FOR THE- FOR THE QUESTIONS. MEMBER I THINK AGO TO WHAT COMMENTS YOU JUST MADE ALL. AYE THOSE THAT WE FROM THE OFFICE. WITNESS WE HAD SOME ABOUT CONVERSE. ABOUT THIS IN THE HOUSING COMMITTEE WHICH ASSEMBLY MEMBER WARD AND NINE ASSEMBLY MEMBER WICKS SAID ON AND THERE'S A- DELICATE BALANCE YOUR VARIOUS FACTORS SO WE'RE TRYING TO DISCUSS TODAY- AND BE MINDFUL OF THE COMMITTEE THE LIMITS OF OUR COMMITTEE'S JURISDICTION SO WE'RE REALLY FOCUSED ON THE PRIVACY ASPECTS OF THIS BILL. IT'S ASSEMBLY MEMBER WARD HAS WORKED WITH THE COMMITTEE TO TAKE- SOME AMENDMENTS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE ROBUST PRIVACY PROTECTIONS. THERE'S OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF OTHER ISSUES HERE- THAT WERE RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION I THINK ISSUES THEY WERE RAISING BUT WE'RE TRYING TO BE MINDFUL OF. THE JURISDICTION OF THE HOUSING COMMITTEE- AND KEEP OUR AND KEEP OUR CONVERSATION TODAY FOCUSED ON THE PRIVACY PROTECTIONS AND I THINK. FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE- THIS BILL YOU KNOW GETS A STRONG RECOMMENDATION ON THE WAY THAT IT PROTECTS THE PRIVACY OF THOSE WHO WOULD BE FILLING OUT THESE APPLICATIONS. JUST A- JUST A PARENTHETICAL ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS CONCERNS. I GUESS I WOULD SAY A SIMILAR WORD YOU KNOW WE'VE HAD GOOD CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS- IN IN HOUSING AS I MENTIONED- COMPLICATED ISSUE I THINK THIS IS A- YOU KNOW THE IDEA OF TENANT SCREENING REPORTS- ARE ONE WAY OF MITIGATING THE BURDEN- THAT WE FIND ON THOSE WHO ARE SEARCHING FOR HOUSING I THINK IT'S A REALLY THOUGHT PROVOKING AN INTERESTING IDEA I APPRECIATE YOUR LEADERSHIP ON IT- AND I APPRECIATE THE WAY THAT YOU CONTINUE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS. AS YOU AND I KNOW A LOT OF STAKEHOLDERS IN THE HOUSING SPACE- TRYING TO CRAFT SOMETHING THAT WORKS FOR FOLKS I ALSO- HAVE CONFIDENCE PUTTING THIS BILL THROUGH THE COMMITTEE TODAY BECAUSE I KNOW YOU TO BE A GREAT CHAMPION OF OUR PHONE OF OUR COMMUNITY SOMEONE WHO IS FOCUSED ON EQUITY AND ALL PROTECTING TENANTS YOU HAVE A RECORD THAT SPEAKS FOR ITSELF ON THAT FRONT SO I'M CONFIDENT THAT YOU'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO HAVE. CONVERSATIONS WITH THE OPPOSITION- YOU KNOW THINK ABOUT SOME OF THEIR CONCERNS THAT FALL OUTSIDE OF THE SCOPE OF THIS- THE JURISDICTION OF THIS COMMITTEE- BUT AGAIN WHEN IT COMES TO THE ISSUES THAT WE'RE FOCUSED ON TODAY IN TERMS OF PROTECTING PRIVACY- I THINK YOU'VE DONE A GOOD JOB I APPRECIATE YOU ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS AND I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I APPRECIATE AGAIN THE STAFF TIME TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH MY STAFF ON THE DETAILS OF COURSE WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OPPOSITION ON MANY OF THE POINTS THEY REYES AND I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST- I VOTE THIS WILL BE HELPFUL. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. AB TWO FIVE FIVE NINE MOTION IS DUE PASSED. AS AMENDED. GABRIEL HI. GABRIEL I KILEY. KILEY AYE. BARRICADE IN. AMERICA AND I'VE BEEN IT. BENNETT I BERMAN. CUNNINGHAM FONG. FONG I IRWIN. BALLADARES NOT PUTTING. A THERE'S NOT VOTING. WICKS WILSON. WILSON I. HI SIX WHAT YOUR BILL IS OUT WE WILL BE THE AT ROLL OAKS AND PERHAPS A MEMBERS. ALL RIGHT AND WITH THAT WE ARE WAITING FOR ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN. I'M TOLD HE'S ON HIS WAY. YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE. WE'RE DOING THE COMMISSION APPLE THIS MORNING MISTER CHAIR- MISTER BERMAN WE ARE GRACED BY YOUR PRESENCE THANK YOU FOR JOINING US AN HONOR TO BE HERE. OF COURSE I WOULD LIKE TO THINK IT TO BEGIN BY THANKING COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL. AS A COMMITTEE ANALYSIS NOTES I'LL BE ACCEPTING AN AMENDMENT TO RESOLVE ANY POTENTIAL AMBIGUITY AND CLARIFY THAT EXPRESS WARRANTY WILL COMMENCE. ON THE DATE OF DELIVERY. CURRENTLY WHEN AN EXPRESS WARRANTY COMMENCES AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE THE CONSUMER DOES NOT RECEIVE THE FULL BENEFIT OR DURATION OF THE WARRANTY IF THE PRODUCT DOES NOT RECEIVE THE SAME DAY. THIS WAS A PROBLEM PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC BUT IT'S ONLY GROWN MORE APPARENT WITH PRODUCTS BEING DELAYED WEEKS IF NOT MONTHS. FOR EXAMPLE IF AN EXPRESS WARRANTY IS GUARANTEED FOR ONE YEAR BUT THE CONSUMER DOES NOT RECEIVE THE PRODUCT FOR SIX MONTHS THEN THE CONSUMER HAS ESSENTIALLY LOST HALF OF THE WARRANTY. AB TWENTY NINE TWELVE WOULD REQUIRE EXPRESS WARRANTIES TO START NO EARLIER THAN THE DATE OF DELIVERY RATHER THAN THE DATE OF PURCHASE. IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THAT THERE IS PRECEDENT FOR HAVING WARRANTIES BEGIN ON THE DELIVERY DATE. CARPET INSTALLERS FOR EXAMPLE TYPICALLY OPERATE THIS WAY. AND THE EUROPEAN WARRANTY BEGINS WHEN A PRODUCT IS RECEIVED NOT PURCHASED. ADDITIONALLY ACCORDING TO STATE LAW THE DURATION OF WARRANTIES FOR WHEELCHAIRS AND HEARING AIDS ALREADY START FROM THE DATE OF DELIVERY. AB TWENTY NINE TWELVE IS SUPPORTED BY NUMEROUS CONSUMER ORGANIZATIONS AND IS RECEIVE NO OPPOSITION. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR ALL OF YOUR AYE VOTES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THE MOTION BY SOME OF OUR HANNAH THE SECOND BY SOME REMEMBER. I AND- I JUST WANTED ADD A THINK WE HAVE LAY- LAW FROM THE CONSUMER PROTECTION POLICY COALITION AND THE CALIFORNIA LOW INCOME CONSUMER COALITION. A MYSTERY OF ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT TODAY WE DO NOT IN PERSON NO SIR OKAY ANYONE IN THE HEARING ROOM THE WISHES TO EXPRESS SUPPORT FOR THE BILL. GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING DANNY CANDOR BECAUSE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LOW INCOME CONSUMER COALITION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. ALL RIGHT SEE NONE WE WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE WE ALREADY HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND ANY COMMENTS QUESTIONS HARD QUESTIONS FOR MR BERMAN ANYONE ELSE. ALL RIGHT CITIES SEEING NINE MISTER BERMAN I WANT- THANK YOU FOR BRINGING FOR THE SPELL- AND- I APPRECIATE THE WAY THAT YOU HAVE- REALLY STEPPED UP TO BE. A CHAMPION ON CONSUMER PROTECTION ISSUES IS REALLY CARVED OUT A NICHE FOR YOURSELF IN THAT AREA- AND I THINK THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT GALLON PARTICULAR WITH THE DELAYS THAT WE'VE EEN. DURING THE PANDEMIC- YOU KNOW IT'S BECOMING APPARENT THAT OUR WARRANTY LAWS NEEDED TO BE UPDATED TO. TO ENSURE THAT WERE PROVIDING CONSUMERS WITH THE FULL TEXT OF THOSE WARRANTIES AND I THINK THE APPROACH THAT YOU HAVE- SUGGESTED MAKES SENSE IT'S AN ELEGANT WAY TO DO IT- AND I'M VERY PLEASED TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY. SO WITH THAT YOU MAY CLOSE THING I YEAH I WILL TAKE THAT AS WELL AS MY CLOTHES THANK YOU JOE GABRIEL. YOU GOT IT THANK YOU- MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.
