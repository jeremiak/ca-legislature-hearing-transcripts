THIS COMMITTEE NOW FOR A WHILE ENSURING CUT MY EIGHT YEAR IT IS- PROBABLY THE MOST SIGNIFICANT- SINGLE MOST SIGNIFICANT THING THAT I DO HERE IN THE CAPITAL WE AS YOU ALL KNOW COVER- ISSUES OF EXTRAORDINARY IMPORTANCE. TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- I APOLOGIZE FOR- THE- HAVING TO A POSTPONED RESCHEDULE LAST WEEK'S MEETING MAKING THIS THE FIRST WEEK- THAT- THAT WE HAVE TO DO OUR WORK THERE WERE SOME MISTER. AND IT JUST BECAME NECESSARY TO- A TO RESCHEDULE AT THE LAST MINUTE SO I% APOLOGIZE FOR THAT. BUT WE'RE GOING TO DO- I BEGIN THIS MORNING WITH- WE'RE GONNA PASS OVER THE VOTE ONLY CALENDAR- UNTIL LATR WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN WITH A REPORT FROM THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY WE HAVE MISTER CRAWFORD HERE. TO GIVE US AN OVERVIEW OF- OF THE BUDGET. THANK THE RESOURCES BUDGET YEAH YOU DON'T HAVE TO EVERYBODY ALL THING WAS IT YEAH IF YOU WANT TO. WELL THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO OVERVIEW OUR BUDGET AND I CAN SAY THAT I'M REALLY EXCITED TO BE HERE TODAY. TO SHARE SOME CONTEXT AS YOU BEGIN YOUR WORK. FOR IN COMING WEEKS- FIRST OF ALL LET ME SAY THANK YOU- CHAIR BLOOM IT YOU KNOW YOU YOU MENTIONED ARE YOU NOTED THAT YOU'VE BEEN. LEADING THE SUBCOMMITTEE FOR THE LAST EIGHT YEARS AND THIS IS MY FIRST FULL YEAR OF BUILDING- THE BUDGET WITH OUR TEAM AT THE AGENCY AND I HAVE TO SAY. WE ARE BUILDING UP A REALLY STRONG FOUNDATION AND THAT IS THANKS TO THIS SUBCOMMITTEE- SECRETARY LAYERED OF COURSE A LOT OF FOLKS. WHO HAVE WHO HAVE YOU KNOW YEAR IN YEAR OUT IMPROVED OUR BUDGET. ARM LET ME ALSO SAY THANK YOU TO STAFF. ABOUT YOUR STAFF AND OUR STAFF BRIAN CASSIAN AMANDA MARTIN AND THEIR COUNTERPARTS AT THE DEPARTMENT'S. WILL LIKE ME THERE ARE HERE IN SOUTH AYE AYES ALL THE HARD WORK THAT GETS DONE FOR MONTH. THE GIVE AWAY ALL OF SECRETS PLEASE. AT I'LL SAY IT BECAUSE THIS IS THE FOR TIME THAT WERE WERE TOGETHER THROUGH THE SUB. PROCESS I REALLY DO VIEW THIS A PARTNER. BOB YOU ALL HAVE IMPORTANT TO. MAINTAIN ACCOUNTABILITY. OF OUR EXECUTIVE BRANCH WITH THE BUDGET THAT WE PROPOSE AND THAT WE WANT TO HELP YOU IN THAT ROLE SO. I WANT TO BE PERSONALLY INVOLVED HOWEVER IS HELPFUL IN COMING WEEKS RECOGNIZING THEIR A WHOLE LOT. OF PEOPLE THAT ARE MUCH MORE EXPERT THAN ME AND THE DETAILS THAT YOU'LL BE ASKING ABOUT. SO OUR AGENCY AS YOU KNOW AND OTHERS IN THE ROOM NO AS A BIG BROAD AGENCY ARE TWENTY SIX DIFFERENT ENTITIES. A PROPOSED- BUDGET OF ALMOST SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS OF SPENDING. YOU'LL SPEND WEEKS OBVIOUSLY COMING THROUGH THESE PROPOSALS- AND ASKING A LOT OF QUESTIONS SO WHAT I'LL DO OVER THE NEXT FEW MINUTES IS SIMPLY. IDENTIFY AS WITH A HIGH LEVEL PRIORITIES IN KEY THEMES THAT RUN THROUGH OUR BUDGET AND- GIVE YOU A SENSE FROM FROM MY ROLE AS SECRETARY- WHAT I AM EXCITED ABOUT. SO FIRST AND FOREMOST- AS IT RELATES TO PRIORITIES IS OF COURSE CLIMATE RESILIENCE- WHAT I CALL PROTECTING PEOPLE AND NATURE FROM THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. WERE IN CALIFORNIA WORLD LEADERS ON REDUCING CARBON POLLUTION- THAT IS TACKLING PLANETARY CLIMATE CHANGE BUT WE KNOW THAT WE CAN AVOID THE IMPACTS THAT CLIMATE DRIVES THAT ARE ALREADY HERE. CONSIDER THESE FACTS 3% OF THE STATE'S LAND MASS BURNED UP IN THE LAST FEW YEARS. THE STATE'S WORST DROUGHT ON RECORD IN THE LAST DECADE AND- ONE AND A FLOODING EMERGENCY OF A VERY LARGE PROPORTIONS THAT OR A VILLAIN IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE KNOW THESE IMPACTS ARE HERE. ARE RESOURCES AGENCY PLAYS A CENTRAL ROLE- ON PROTECTING COMMUNITIES AND NATURAL PLACES FROM THOSE IMPACTS. WE ARE ECITED THAT THE GOVERNOR IN PROPOSING HIS BOND IN JANUARY I CALLED FOR A CLIMATE RESILIENCE BOND- TO BE DISCUSSED BY THE LEGISLATURE AND IF THERE'S AGREEMENT NOT TO BE CONSIDERED BY THE VOTERS IN NOVEMBER. THAT'S REALLY BUILDS ON OUR LEADERSHIP IN WITHIN THE LEGISLATURE AND PROPOSALS- OVER THE LAST YEAR I KNOW THAT ONE THAT WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE CLIMATE RESILIENCE BOND TODAY BUT I LOOK FORWARD TO- TALKING ABOUT THAT WITH YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES IN COMING WEEKS. ONE IMPORTANT ELEMENT I PRIMARY. IS OBVIOUSLY A CONTINUE INVESTMENTS IN- OUT WILD FIRE PROTECTION. YOU KNOW THAT IN THAT LAST- IT LAST YEAR'S BUDGET THE GOVERNOR AND LEGISLATURE APPROPRIATED OVER A BILLION DOLLARS. OF FUNDING BOTH TO EMERGENCY RESPONSE THROUGH OUR- CAL FIRE- ENTITY BUT THEN ALSO A SIGNIFICANT PREVENTATIVE WORK. THIS YEAR WE CONTINUE TO BUILD ON THOSE INVESTMENTS INCLUDING A SIGNIFICANT PROPOSED INVESTMENT IN. INCREASING THE PERSON POWER- WITHIN WITHIN CAL FIRE. NOT ONE HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS ARE GENERAL FUND SPENDING ALMOST SEVEN HUNDRED POSITIONS TO BE PHASED IN OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. TO REALLY BUILD THAT- CORE BASE OF FIRE FIGHTING CAPACITY AND BUILD OUR OPERATIONAL FLEXIBILITY. WE HAVE NEW FUNDING FOR A PROPOSED WILDFIRE FORECAST CENTER WHICH WILL INCREASE THE INTELLIGENCE AND THE FORECASTING ABILITIES THAT WE BRING TO- THE FIRE FIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE ARE CALLING FOR SIGNIFICANT FUNDING. FOR A MAJOR HARM HOME HARDENING- PROGRAM RECOGNIZING THAT- REDUCING THE THREAT OF CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES IS NOT JUST ABOUT YOUR FUEL BREAKS IN YOUR FOREST MANAGEMENT WE HAVE TO DO MORE WITHIN COMMUNITIES- TO PROTECT OUR OUR OUR PEOPLE FROM. A WILDFIRE. ANOTHER KEY ELEMENT OF CLIMATE RESILIENCE IS OBVIOUSLY PROTECTING AGAINST DROUGHT AND FLOOD. ARE GOVERNOR. DIRECTED OUR AGENCY IN OTHERS BACK IN APRIL TO DEVELOP WATER RESILIENCE PORTFOLIO. WHICH IS A REALLY PUMP. PUBLICLY TRANSPARENT- ROAD MAP FOR OUR OWN INVESTMENTS WITHIN THE NEW CIVIC MINISTRATION ON WATER IN COMING YEARS. I SO YOU'LL SEE IN THIS BUDGET WHEN YOU TALK TO THE DEPARTMENT. RESORT IS AN ENTITY. HOW THOSE PRIORITIES MANTA. HOW ALL. A PORTION OF OUR PROPOSED BILLIONS IS FOCUSED ON BUILDING AND RESULT IMPORT TO MEMBERS OF THIS CAN WE ARE SUGGEST SIGNIFICANT FUNDING ONE TIME GENERAL FUND TO HELP LOCAL COMMUNITIES IMPACT- SHOULD SORRY IMPLEMENT THE SUSTAINABLE GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT ACT OR STIGMA- WE KNOW THAT SIGMA IS NECESSARY TO PROTECT GROUNDWATER SUPPLIES- ACROSS THE STATE FOR DECADES TO COME BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT IT WILL HAVE REAL IMPACTS IN COMMUNITIES AND SO BELIEVE THAT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE STATE TO CONTINUE TO INVEST TO REALLY POOR THAT LOCAL LEADERSHIP MANAGING THEIR OWN GROUND WATER BASE. SO CLIMATE RESILIENCE MAJOR PRIORITY ANOTHER. MAJOR PRIORITY IS PROTECTING WHAT WE CALL OUR BIO DIVERSITY IN THE STATE. CALIFORNIA IS BLESSED TO BE- AN AREA OF TREMENDOUS NATURAL RICHNESS KNOWN AS ONE OF THE BIO DIVERSE HOT SPOTS IN THE WORLD WE HAVE A GREATER VARIETY OF PLANTS AND ANIMALS THAN ALMOST ANYWHERE ON THE PLANET. WE OBVIOUSLY IT DO A GOOD JOB PROTECTING ANIMALS ON THE BRINK OF EXTINCTION THROUGH ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT OUR PROTECTIONS BUT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE AND I THINK OUR PERSPECTIVE WE WANT TO DO MORE TO KEEP THOSE PLANTS AND ANIMALS- FROM ACTUALLY FACING EXTINCTION. I LIKEN IT TO HEALTHCARE POLICY I WORK WE ALWAYS NEED TO KEEP THE PATIENT ALIVE IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT BUT IF THAT'S THE ENTIRETY OF YOUR HEALTH CARE POLICY I YOU HAVE A SEVERELY LIMITED APPROACH AND SO LIKE WISE WE ARE EXCITED ABOUT MAKING SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS TO APP PROTECT AND RESTORE NATURE- PRIOR TO IT AND SO THREAT. AND I INCLUDES SIGNET. FUNDING POLLS ALL OF FOR THE TECH. THAT ACTUALLY BE A CRITICAL TOOL TO MANAGE THIS PILOT. AND THEN SIGNIFICANT ONE TIME FUNDING- THAT WILL HELP THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE BE MORE EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT I DOING THINGS LIKE- PROTECTING MIGRATION CORRIDORS AND THE LIKE AND FISH HATCHERIES ETCETERA RELATE. TO THIS WORK ON BIODIVERSITY WE ARE CONTINUINGOUR INVESTMENT IN STRENGTHENING THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. RECOGNIZING IS YOU KNOW CHAIR BLOOM THAT DURING THE GREAT RECESSION AND- HISTORICALLY IT HAS LOST- GENERAL FUND. AND ITS CAPACITY HAS BEEN REDUCED- WHILE ITS STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS CONTINUE TO INCREASE. SO ONE OF THE THINGS YOU'LL SEE FROM ME OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS IS A REAL PRIORITY TO CONTINUE TO REINVEST IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE TO BUILD ITS CAPACITY. AB SO WE CALL FOR THE PERMIT EXTENSION OF THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS OF GENERAL FUND THAT WAS TIME LIMITED- OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS. AS WELL AS- SIGNIFICANT NEW CAPACITY WITHIN THE AGENCY. TO IMPLEMENT THE CALIFORNIA ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT- AND HELP OUR ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION ROJECTS HAPPEN MORE QUICKLY WE CALL THIS CUTTING GREEN TAPE. REMARKABLY SOME OF THESE PROJECTS THAT WE FIND THROUGH OUR BONDS IN OUR INVESTMENTS FULLY A THIRD OF THE PROJECT BUDGET IS PLANNING AND PERMITTING. AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE THREATS THAT WE EXPERIENCE FROM CLIMATE CHANGE BIODIVERSITY THREATS WE NEED TO DO THIS ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION MORE COST EFFECTIVELY AND MORE EFFICIENTLY. SO PART OF OUR INVESTMENTS ARE ACTUALLY TO BUILD- SORT OF A MULTI FUNCTIONAL TEAM WITHIN FISH AND WILDLIFE TO GET THESE PROJECTS PERMITTED AND PROVE MORE QUICKLY. THE CLIMATE RESULT DIVERSE. A THIRD PER PRY. IS X. ACCESS. OF ALL CALIFORNIANS TO OUR PARKS ARE OUTDOORS AND OUR NATURAL PLACES. THIS REALLY DRIVES WITH THE GOVERNOR'S COMMITMENT OF A CALIFORNIA FOR ALL. YOU'LL NOTICE THAT REALLY THE ANCHOR OF THIS PRIORITY IS IT IS A PROPOSED- SET OF FUND OF- A FUNDING ACTIONS WITHIN OUR DEPARTMENT STATE PARKS. ARE SPECIFICALLY SIXTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THAT WE PACKAGE INTO WHAT WE'RE CALLING A PARKS FOR ALL INITIATIVE- WITCHING WHICH INCLUDES OUR PROPOSED FUNDING FOR ACQUISITION. OF A NEW STATE PARK. AS WELL AS THE ACQUISITION OF CERTAIN IN HOLDINGS THAT SIMPLY MAKES SENSE TO EXPAND PARK OFFERINGS. IMPORTANTLY WE ARE PROPOSING FUNDING FOR AN OUTDOOR EQUITY GRANTS PROGRAM. WHICH WAS A PROGRAM ESTABLISHED- THROUGH ASSEMBLY BILL TWO OH NINE AUTHORED ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEE MON. THE NOTION IS WE HAVE WHAT CLASS PARKS WORLD CLASS STATE PARKS BUT IN A LOT OF CASES SOME OF OUR COMMUNITIES CAN'T ACCESS THOSE PARKS. SO HOW CAN WE ACTUALLY HELP THAT THIS COMMUNITIES IN THOSE COMMUNITY MEMBERS ACTUALLY ACTS PARKS SO YOU HEAR FROM STATE PARK. ABOUT THIS AFTER WE REALLY THINK THAT THIS PART FOR ALL OF US IN THE- IN. THE IS GOING TO BE THE BEGINNING. OF A MULTI IN THIS TO IN OUR- TO A PARKS AND HOPE. SO I JUST THOSE THE THREE PER PRIOR CLIMATE RESILIENCE BY. AN AXE. LET ME MENTION A FEW OTHER IMPORTANT I IN OUR BUDGET NOT ONE IS OIL AND GAS OVER. SO AS YOU KNOW. OUR GOVERNOR HOW BEEN PH<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;N. TO AND OVERSIGHT OF&lt;/c&gt;</u> OILING PRODUCTION PRODUCTION IN THE STATE- THAT HAS INCLUDED OVERHAULING THE DIVISION THAT REGULATES THAT ACTIVITY. A WHAT WE USED TO KNOW AS THE DIVISION OF OIL GAS AND GEOTHERMAL RESOURCES OUR DOG- HAS BEEN TRANSFORMED. WITH AN UPDATED MICHIGAN AND A NEW NAME WHICH WERE FOR REFERRING TO CAL JAMMER THE CALIFORNIA GEOLOGIC ENERGY MANAGEMENT DIVISION- FOR THE NEW ACKERMAN. IN THE NEW ACRONYM WOULD BE MEAN BUT ACTUALLY DIDN'T I WASN'T PART OF A BROADER MISSION AND- IN REALLY REINVIGORATED INVESTMENT IN FOCUS AND THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE EXCITED TO. TO TALK ABOUT HERE IN COMING WEEKS- WITHIN THIS BUDGET WE'RE PROPOSING. TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR FUNDING INCREASE- THROUGH THE US DOES THE OIL AND GAS SPECIAL FUND FOR A HUNDRED AND TWENTY EIGHT NEW POSITIONS TO BE PHASED IN OVER THREE YEARS SPECIFICALLY FOCUSED ON THREE AREAS ONE IS TO EXPAND- THE FIELD PRESENCE OF CAL JAM INSPECTORS- WORKING IN A FULL AND FAIR WAY WITH OUR OIL AND GAS OPERATORS. TO ENSURE ENFORCEMENT OF EXISTING LAWS AND REGULATIONS THE SECOND IMPORTANTLY IS TO VALIDATE EXISTING- BONDING REQUIREMENTS FOR PRIVATE OPERATORS TO REDUCE OUT YOUR FINANCIAL LIABILITY FROM THE STATE. AND THE THIRD IS THE BASICALLY TO PROVIDE MORE PUBLIC TRANSPARENCY OF CAL GEMS ACTIVITIES BOTH FOR INDUSTRY OPERATORS AND FOR OTHER INTERESTED STAKEHOLDERS. ANOTHER IMPORTANT AREA OF INVESTMENT RELATES TO OUR GROWING PARTNERSHIPS WITH- CALIFORNIA TRIBES AND WE INCLUDE IN THIS PROPOSAL- FUNDING FOR A TRUTH AND HEALING COUNCIL- WHICH WAS CALLED FOR IN- GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER LAST YEAR. I'M ALSO VERY EXCITED TO PROPOSE FUNDING FOR A NEW POSITION WITHIN OUR AGENCY EXECUTIVE TEAM ARE CALLED ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR TRIBAL AFFAIRS. WHAT I'VE WHAT I'VE LEARNED IN MY FIRST YEAR PLUS ON THIS JOB IS WE HAVE A LOT TO LEARN FROM OUR TRIBAL COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA ABOUT STEWARDING OUR ENVIRONMENT- THESE PEOPLE'S OF STEWART AT OUR ENVIRONMENT FOR MILLENNIA. AND SO WE WANT TO DEEPEN OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH TRIBES- MOVING FORWARD ON THE CALL MANAGEMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES AND THIS POSITION WILL BE KEY. LIKEWISE I'M ALSO EXCITED TO PROPOSE AN ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE- THAT WILL REALLY- SPEAR HAD A AGENCY WIDE PROGRAM TO ENSURE. EQUITY ACROSS ALL OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN PROGRAMS OUR SISTER AGENCY CALLIE PA IS REALLY A MODEL. OF THE INSTITUTIONALIZATION OF A REALLY STRONG ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE POLICY THAT RUNS THROUGHOUT- THE WORK OF THAT AGENCY. AND SO WE- SEEK TO EMULATE THAT TYPE OF PROGRAM AND IT BEGINS WITH ACTUALLY HAVING A LEADER AT THE EXECUTIVE LEVEL TO DRIVE THIS. SO THAT'S A GLIMPSE- OR A SNAPSHOT OF OUR HIGH LEVEL PRIORITIES. AGAIN THANK YOU FOR THE WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE IN THE WORK THAT YOU WILL DO TO HELP US- INSURE THAT WE HAVE AS EFFECTIVE A BUDGET AS POSSIBLE. AND CHAIR AND VICE CHAIR I'D BE GLAD TO ENTERTAIN ANY QUESTIONS OR THOUGHT THAT YOU HAVE. THANK A LOT OF- VERY IMPORTANT UPRIGHT PRIORITIES UP PERSONAL PRIORITY- THAT YOU DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE TO TALK CONDUCT A CAME UP DURING THE- THE INTERIM WHEN I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO- TAKE A SYRUP BUST MEN'S HOLIDAY AND A TRAVEL ALONG THE COAST FROM- THE CENTRAL COAST ALL THE WAY UP TO THE- NORTH COAST BUT- AND IN ADDITION. AND IN THE- SB THE- THAT IS SO. COASTAL RESOURCE. I HAD THE UP TO A TO A NUMBER OF PARKS. AND YOU. ONE OF THEIR TOP CA WAS THE DETERIORATION OF THE KELP FOREST- ALONG THE COAST AND THIS STRIKES ME AS BEING A- MAYBE NOT EVEN A SLOW MOVING A RAPIDLY MOVING TO- DISASTER IN THE MAKING AND I'M WONDERING IF- YOU HAVE PLANS TO ADDRESS THAT IF THE DEPARTMENT HAS PLANTS YEAH WELL LET ME FIRST AGREE WITH YOU THIS IS NOT AN AIR IF CONCERNED THAT A FULL BLOWN ECOLOGICAL CRISIS. SO ARE FOR ARE POTENTIALLY LIKE THE OCEAN THERE BIG- I CON PLANTS THAT FORM THE FOR OF THIS OFF SHORE ECOSYSTEM IN RE YEARS WE'VE LAW 97% OF OUR KELP FOREST IN THE UPPER HALF OFF THE UPPER HALF OF OUR STATE. AND IT HAS TO DO WITH A VARIETY OF CHANGING CONDITIONS IN OUR OCEAN INCLUDING OCEAN WARMING- THAT KILLED OFF AT C. STARTS SPECIES THAT WAS A PRIMARY PREDATOR. OF A PURPLE URCHIN. NOW THIS GETS PRETTY INTERESTING BECAUSE OUR RED URCHIN OFF OUR COAST ARE COMMERCIALLY CAN BE COMMERCIALIZED AND ARE HARVESTED. OFFER SALE FOR SEAFOOD PURPLE URCHIN CANNOT BE COMMERCIALIZED AND WHEN THOSE OCEAN CONDITIONS CHANGED AND WE LOST THE PRIMARY PREDATOR THE PURPLE URCHINS. THE PURPLE ORIGINS MOVED IN AND I'VE CREATED BROAD BEHRENS THAT RUN FOR HUNDREDS OF MILES AND IT KILLED OFF OUR KELP FOREST. HUGE CRISIS GOOD NEWS IS OUR THANKS TO RESOURCES ALREADY PROVIDED BY THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE WE ACTUALLY ARE DOING SOMETHING ABOUT THIS CRISIS. THROUGH OUR OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL ACTUALLY THIS MONTH WE APPROVED ARE UP FOR OF TWO THIRDS OF A MILLION DOLLARS OR A POT PROGRAM. TO ADD. BE IN. ARE UNEMPLOYED OUR DIVERS ON THE DOOR COAST. TO OUR- THESE PURPLE URCHIN IN. BUT AREA. AND PARTNER WITH THE NONPROFIT TO SCIENTIFIC THE MONITOR HOW THE REMOVAL OF EARTH AND- I COOLEY PERFORM IN THE- BRINGING BACK OUR SEEK HELP. CHALLENGE CHAIR WE DON'T KNOW WHAT ANSWER IS WE HAVE SOME VERY CANCER AROUND HOW TO BRING BACK THE THAT THE KELP FORESTS BUT- WE ARE FOCUSED RIGHT NOW I'M GETTING IN THE WATER. REMOVING THESE IN CERTAIN AREAS AND THEN LEARNING FROM THAT I THINK IF THERE WAS AN AREA WHERE THE LEGISLATURE COULD BE HELPFUL IT WOULD BE TO IDENTIFY POTENTIALLY RESOURCES TO EXPAND THAT WORK. HI INDOOR TO BRING TOGETHER A OR AN ACADEMIC COUNSELOR AN ACADEMIC- ADVISORY BODY OF THE BEST SCIENTISTS FROM ACROSS THE WORLD TO REALLY INFORM US HOW WE REVERSE THIS CRISIS. WE ARE OFTEN I THINK. ABOUT AN ADDRESS THE HEALTH OF OUR LAND BASE FOR US- BUT WE DON'T THINK MUCH ABOUT THE- THE FORCE THAT LIES BENEATH THE SURFACE OF THE- OF THE OCEAN- CAN YOU REMIND US. OF WHY THE CAL FORCES IMPORTANT. YEAH I MEAN IT'S FUNDAMENTAL IF ANYONE'S BEEN OF THE MONTEREY BAY AQUARIUM YOU KNOW YOU KNOW THESE ARE THESE THESE BIG TALL PLANTS THAT REALLY GO UP TO THE SURFACE IT WOULD BE LIKE LOSING. THE REDWOOD FOREST ON OUR COAST AND A NEW TING THAT AND INSTEAD OF LOOKING UP AND SEEING THESE THESE BIG ICONIC TREES YOU SEE NOTHING- THAT'S REALLY WHAT IT IS RIGHT NOW OFF OUR COAST IT IS BEARING. AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS ALL OF THOSE ANIMALS THAT EXIST IN THAT FOR IT ARE GONE IMAGINE. THE ENEMY YEAH WE'RE ANIMALS LIVE IF YOU COMPLETELY LOST A FOR AND IT DENUDED. SO THE CHILD IT'S IN A- CRISIS THAT'S YOU SAY SO NOT A LOT OF CALIFORNIA X. THAT. BUT THOSE WHO DO KNOW THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS CRISIS. OF THANK YOU FOR HELPING ME DRAW A LITTLE BIT OF ATTENTION TO THAT IMPORTANT ISSUE TO DID YOU SEE. THAT THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING. FOR THE YOUR CHIN PROJECT WAS. A MILLION DOLLARS YES. OKAY SO YOU KNOW VERY OPEN TO AUG THAT IN POINT THOUGH YOU KNOW WE DON'T IF WHAT WORKS AND SO. THEY IS AN APPROACH INSTANCE AND WE OUR PILOTS ARE PERFORMED FAIRLY SMALL SCALE PILOTS WHERE WITHIN A PLOT WERE READING YOU KNOW PAYING PAYING DIVERSE TO REMOVE THE URGENT BUT THEN UNDERSTANDING WHETHER THEY COME BACK. HE QUICKLY OR WHETHER IT IS ACTUALLY EFFECTIVE TOWARDS REBUILDING THE KELP FORESTS AND WHAT I WOULD SAY IS BEFORE WE INVEST- YOU KNOW. SIZEABLE A SCALED UP RESOURCES IN THAT WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WORKS. INDEED OF THE OTHER- ISSUE I WANTED TO ASK YOU ABOUT- A IS ONE THAT'S BEEN IN THE NEWS LATELY AND THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE- A CONTINUING STRING. THEM OUTLINED POPULATION- A IN MY DISTRICT AND IN OTHER PLACES AROUND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA CAN YOU- ADDRESS THAT YEAH LOS ANGELES AND BOM BOM MUMBAI INDIA HAVE THE DISTINCTION OF BEING THE LARGEST METROPOLITAN AREAS IN THE WORLD IN WHICH PEOPLE ARE CO EXISTING WITH AN APEX PREDATOR. IN MUMBAI IT'S AT BENGAL TIGER IN GREATER LOS ANGELES IT'S ONLINE AND IT'S REMARKABLE YOU ALWAYS HAVE INTERESTING. DATA POINTS- TO IT TO ME IF YOU KNOW OUR ABILITY TO THESE MOUNTAIN LIONS IN THIS ANIMAL MY AND IN THE IN THE MOUNTAINS AROUND LOS ANGELES IS ISRAEL TEST I CAN WE CONTINUE TO GROW AS A AT THE FORTY MILLION PEOPLE AND PROTECT OUR BY. THESE MOUNTAIN LIONS AS YOU KNOW CHAIR IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ARE THREATENED I'M BY L. GENETIC WALL AND OTHER LOW AND THIS THE AND THE LOSS OF. SO WE HAVE THESE POP THAT ARE- THAT HAVE SOME GENETIC DISTINCTION AND IF THEY CAN'T ACTUALLY HAVE A LARGE ENOUGH HABITAT AND MAINTAIN IT DIVERT BE THROUGH MEETING THE FROM OUTLAW THAN ULTIMATELY I. THREAT GLAD TO REPORT THAT OUR DEPARTMENT OF FISH WILDLIFE IS CONSIDERED A PETITION TO LAST- THIS OP POPULATION MOUNTAIN LIONS IN SOUTHERN. UNDER CALIFORNIA ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT AS A GENETICALLY DISTINCT SUBSPECIES OF MOUNTAIN LION THAT WILL BE A SCIENCE BASED DECISION MAKING PROCESS BUT WE CAMPUS PRINCE PRESUME WHAT WILL HAPPEN THERE BUT IT IS BEING CONSIDERED BY THE DEPARTMENT OR THE CAT FOOD FISHING GAME COMMISSION. THIS SPRING. BUT ALSO IN TO FOCUS ON THREE AREAS OUT OF NOT LIONS AND CALIFORNIA THAT FIRST DEAF. PERMITS AND BEEN WORKING CLOSELY THE RECTOR BONHAM TO REALLY UNDERSTAND HOW DEPREDATION PERMITS WHICH IS THE PERMISSION TO KILL A PREDATOR THAT'S- KILLING LIVESTOCK ETCETERA. HOW THOSE ARE TRULY THE LAST RESORT AND HOW WE AS A STATE CAN DO MORE. TO AVOID THAT THE NEED TO ISSUE THOSE DEPREDATION PERMITS NUMBER ONE THE SECOND IS RODENTICIDE WHICH IS AN ISSUE YOU'VE LET ON I WHICH IS A LOT OF OUR HOUSEHOLD- POISONS TO KILL OFF ROUTE THAT CETERA. ARE FINDING THEIR WAY INTO THE FOOD SOURCES OF THESE OP OF THESE MOUNTAIN LIONS AND SO OBVIOUSLY WE COULD TALK MORE ABOUT WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN BUT IT'S PARTNERING- ARE- AGENCIES WITH YOUR LEADERSHIP TO ACTUALLY. REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF IDENTIFIED THAT GET IN THE WILD POPULATION AND THEN THE THIRD. IS TRAFFIC A MAJOR- MORTALITY THREAT FOR THESE MOUNTAIN LIONS IS HIGHWAY ONE A NE WE'RE REALLY EXCITED WITH THIS OVER PASS THAT'S BEING CONSTRUCTED OVER HIGHWAY ONE A ONE WHICH WILL PROVIDE RECREATIONAL ACCESS BUT ALSO LINK THAT TO HABITATS OF THESE MOUNTAIN LION POPULATIONS. BUT CHAIR WEEK WE CAN DO MORE TO ACTUALLY PROTECT- THE LAND ARE JOINING OR THAT'S CONNECTED BY THAT OVER PASS I'M SO THERE MAY BE OPPORTUNITIES TO EXT AND- OUR OUR OUR- NATURE PRESERVES- IN. THAT SORT OF NORTH. AREA OF THIS ABOUT A IN ORDER TO. REALLY IN THAT. CROSSING TO BRING TO HELP BRING BACK THE POPULATION. THANK YOU- I APPRECIATE YOUR OPTIMISM ON THE WILDLIFE OVER PASSED TO- SAID THAT IT'S BEING CONSTRUCTED WELL IT'S NOT QUITE UNDER CONSTRUCTION SORRY BUT IF THE PLANET THAT OPTIMISM WILL HELP US GET THERE YEAH. WELL I SAY THIS WHERE WE KNOW WE IN THE GOV ROUTE YOU KNOW HIM REAL WANNA. THAT THAT OVER ACROSS HAPPEN AND HE ACTUALLY. THE SITE LAST YEAR AND THIS HAS BEEN A PARTNERSHIP OF THE STATE WITH PHILANTHROPIC LEADERS AND I KNOW THE ONE AREA OF FOCUS IS REALLY ENSURING THAT WE CAN GET THAT PHILANTHROPIC MATCH- BUT WE STAND READY TO DO ALL THAT WE CAN TO ACTUALLY- HELP THAT. MATERIALIZE WELL LET'S- DO SOME GOOD WORK TOGETHER ON ALL OF THE OF THE BULLET POINTS THAT YOU'VE IDENTIFIED FOR US AND LET ME CALL NOW ON MISTER FUNK A AND IF THE REST OF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS IT. WILL TAKE THOSE TWO I THINK IT WAS A OF BEING EVERY DON'T WANT WHILE TO ALL THE MEMBERS IF IN SINCE BE AN- MORE. JGB HERE NEW HAVE A HEADACHE SENSE OF CALM. ABOUT I GUESS. CAL GAGA JIM NOW. YOU KNOW YOUR VIEW OF THIS NEW. AT THE HUNDRED TWENTY NEW POSITIONS THAT YOU. THAT YOU'RE REQUESTING A THAT DID. RICK A YOU. WE HAD X. COVER. ABOUT THE PERMIT BACK THAT IS A- THAT. I BELIEVE IS STIFLING. THE OF ENERGY BUT- AND OUR STATE. DO ANY OF A- THE HARD WAY NEW POSITION. DO OF IT ADDRESS THE BACK. THE GOOD. LET ME ANSWER DIRECTLY LET ME JUST GIVE A LITTLE CON. WE IS THAT YOU WE'VE BEEN. WE'VE BEEN CLEAR THAT. AS WE IMPROVE REGULATORY OVERSIGHT WE NEED TO PROVIDE SORT OF FULL AND FAIR OVERSIGHT WHICH MEANS HAVING A CLEAR LINES OF COMMUNICATION WITH INDUSTRY OPERATORS- WHICH WE DO- AND WE LEARN FROM INDUSTRY OPERATORS THAT THEY REALLY. DESIRE TWO THINGS- ONE IS CLARITY ON THE RULES THAT GOVERN THEIR OPERATIONS AND THE SECOND IS CERTAINTY- AS BUSINESSES THEY NEED TO PLAN AND REALLY NEED TO UNDERSTAND- WHAT IT YOU KNOW WHAT TIME LINES ARE REQUIRED IN PERMITTING AN OVERSIGHT. SO WE'VE BEEN WORKING TO ONE BE VERY CLEAR- AROUND THE OVERSIGHT WE NEED TO PROVIDE AND THEN TO BUILD CERTAINTY SO THAT AT LEAST THERE'S AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENED. THERE ARE A COUPLE OF AREAS ARE COUPLE TYPES OF PERMITS- THAT HAVE SLOWED DOWN RECENTLY. ONE IS HYDRAULIC FRACTURING PERMITS- AND THE OTHER IS PERMITS RELATED TO A PRACTICE CALLED I HIGH PRESSURE STEAM INJECTIONS. EACH HAS A DIFFERENT REASON FOR BEING- FOR SLOWING DOWN- THE FIRST HYDRAULIC FRACTURING. ARE UNDERGOING PERMIT BY PERMIT REVIEWS BY AN INDEPENDENT- OUTSIDE ENTITY LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABS WHILE- THE THAT PERMITTING PROCESS- RECEIVES AN AUDIT FROM THE OFFICE OF STATE AUDITS AND EVALUATIONS. THIS WAS IN RESPONSE TO CONCERNS LAST SUMMER ABOUT- CAL GEMS PERMITTING PROCESS FROM WHERE WE SET WE NEED TO BUILD PUBLIC CONFIDENCE OF THAT THE PERMITTING PROCESS THAT CAL JAM HAS IN PLACE. IS FULLY ADEQUATE- TOWARD PROTECTING- YOU DON'T ALL THAT WE NEED TO PROTECT WHEN GIVING A PERMIT. THE SECOND IS- THAT OTHER PRACTICEHIGH PRESSURE STEAM INJECTIONS. AND THAT. WE WILL CONTINUE WAS RAISED ABOUT THE SO CALLED SURFACE EXPRESSION FOR THESE OIL LEAKS AT THE SURFACE OVER THE SUMMER AND THE CORRELATION BETWEEN THAT PRACTICE AND THOSE OIL LEAKS. SO WHAT WE WHAT WE ARE CALTRAIN ANNOUNCED IN NOVEMBER WAS- PLACING A MORATORIUM SPECIFICALLY ON THAT PRACTICE UNTIL A STUDY IS COMPLETED TO REALLY UNDERSTAND THE CORRELATION OF THAT PRACTICE TO BE SURFACE EXPRESSIONS. SO IN CASES THAT'S BEEN A POINT STRAIGHT XIN FOR THE INDUSTRY BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT SEEING PERMITS COME THROUGH. AND WE'VE BEEN VERY CLEAR WITH THEM THAT THIS INDEPENDENT REVIEW IS TAKING PLACE AND WE DO ANTICIPATE IT ACTUALLY MOVING FORWARD AND ENABLING PERMITS TO BE ISSUED- AS IT RELATES TO THE HYDRAULIC FRACTURING AND THEN AS IT RELATES TO THE MORATORIUM THE HIGH PRESSURE STEAM PRACTICE- WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT LAWRENCE LIVERMORE. AND CAL JIM CAN ACTUALLY PARTNER ON THAT STUDY WHICH WE ANTICIPATE pIN THAT THAT STUDY IS POISED TO BEGIN WITH AND APART THE FEDERAL DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY APPROVED A CONTRACT FOR LAWRENCE LIVERMORE. I'M IN SO WE ANTICIPATE THAT CONTRACT TO BE. PROVED ANY DATE NOW. SO IN DIRECT ANSWER TO QUESTION THESE ARE ONE AND TWENTY EIGHT POSITIONS DON'T FOCUS ON YEAH I INCREASING SPEED OF PERMITTING THEY- FOCUS ON ONE HAVING OUT MORE INSPECTORS IN THE FIELD TO WIN. YES ACTIVITY WITH THE OF INDUSTRY OPERATORS RIGHT NOW ARE WITNESSING RATES ARE LOWER THAN THEY NEED TO BE- I THINK YOU'LL IT WHEN YOU ASKED INDUSTRY OPERATORS THEY'LL TELL YOU THAT IT'S ACTUALLY. CAN BE CONSTRUCTIVE AND HELPFUL TO HAVE. A CAL JIM EMPLOYEE WITH THEM- TOO AGAIN SOME EYES CLARITY IN COMMUNICATION SO THAT THAT'S NUMBER ONE. NUMBER TWO IS ACTUALLY INCREASED NUMBER PEOPLE SPECIFIC FOCUSED ON THAT I'VE FOUGHT WHAT ARE THE BONDING. THAT THESE OPERATORS NEED IN OTHER WORDS WHAT MONEY DO THEY NEED TO PUT UP TO ENSURE THE STATE DOESN'T GET LEFT WITH THE BILL. IF THEY ULTIMATELY I GO OUT OF BUSINESS OR- OR SHUT DOWN. THAT SECOND AND THEN THE THIRD IS. OF MODEST INVEST AND MORE P. TO ACTUALLY COME. ARE THE ACTIONS THAT CAL GEMMA'S TAKING BOTH TO THE OPERATORS THE INDUSTRY AS WELL AS STAKEHOLDERS WE HAVE A REALLY POWERFUL INFORMATION SYSTEM WITHIN CAL JAM CALLED THE WELL STARK PERMIT TRACKING SYSTEM AND IT DOES PROVIDE INFORMATION ON PERMITS TO OPERATORS AND- ON THE PUBLIC BUT WE NEED- WE NEED TO- SLIGHTLY LARGER INVESTMENTS TO ACTUALLY TRANSLATE THAT. VERY POWERFUL INFORMATION SYSTEM IN TWO. INFORMATION THAT WERE REGULAR PEOPLE CAN UNDERSTAND. SO I'VE I SO I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE THERE IS A BALANCE AND I'D I'D BEEN IN THE WITNESS- WITNESSING OF THE OPERATIONS I GUESS MY CONCERN IS THAT BUT THAT WHILE ALL THESE THINGS ARE HAPPENING WE'VE CREATED A DE FACTO MORATORIUM OF PRODUCTION IN IN THE CITY CALIFORNIA AT A TIME WHEN OUR ENERGY NEEDS ARE GROWING AND WE PROBABLY DO NEED TO PRODUCE- MORE- MORE ENERGY SO YOU ARE THE DEMANDS OF CALIFORNIANS DON'T GO AWAY. AND SO AS SO THE ONLY THING LEFT FOR CALIFORNIA IS TO IMPORT OIL FROM OVERSEAS AND SO IF WE DON'T PRODUCE OIL IN CALIFORNIA BY CALIFORNIANS AND WE HAVE NO CHOICE AS AS AS POLICY MAKERS TO FIGURE OUT A WAY HOW DO WE MAKE UP THAT DIFFERENCE AND RIGHT NOW THE ONLY WAY WE'RE GONNA SATISFIED THE ENERGY DEMANDS OF CALIFORNIA. IF WE DON'T PRODUCE IN CALIFORNIA IS SAID TO IT TO IMPORTED SO. IS THERE A RECOGNITION THAT THAT THE PERMIT BACKLOG. IS A TREMENDOUS CHALLENGE AND IN SOME WAYS IS THERE ANY DIRECTION THAT YOU'RE GIVING TO ADDRESS. TORY I'M ON PRODUCTION IN CALIFORNIA AND THERE'S NO DOUBT AND I DON'T SAY THAT I WANT TO SAY THAT THAT. THE AFFECT IS A DE FACTO ME NO MORE TRADE WE CANNOT GET IF WE CAN'T GET PERMITS WELL I THINK IT. YOU KNOW I THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO SIT DOWN AND SORT OF WORK THROUGH THE NUMBERS- WITH YOUR OFFICE AND OTHER THAT ARE INTERESTED BECAUSE- WE'VE WE'VE IDENTIFIED A WE'VE TALKED ABOUT TO VERY SPECIFIC PERMITS FOR HYDRAULIC FRACTURING IN FOR A- FOR A VERY SPECIFIED IN SECTION PRACTICE. WHAT YOU'LL NOTICE THERE YOU GO IF YOU IF YOU. AT DACHAU GEMS WEBSITE WHICH PROVIDES MONTHLY DATA ON PERMITTING IS PERMITTED FOR EXAMPLE ON. THE WELLS NEW WELL WITHIN EXISTING FIELD ON A REVIEW. OR ABANDONED INS ARE CONTINUING- SO I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT THE INDUSTRY IS FRUSTRATED ABOUT THESE ASPECTS OR THESE THESE TYPES OF PERMITS BUT I WANT TO JUST BE CLEAR BECAUSE- THERE HAVE BEEN SOME. IN THE MEDIA THAT. WHILE WE'RE FOCUSED ON IN. OVERSIGHT IN THOSE. AREAS THAT THAT PERMITTED IN THE PERMITTING PROCESS- CONTINUES I IN THOSE. AREAS BUT LET ME JUST BE CLEAR THAT AGAIN IN A WORLD WE WANT TO THE OF. ALL AND THERE ARE. REGULATORY OVERSIGHT BY. AND IN FACT. ARE INS ARM PROVIDE AS MUCH CERTAIN THE AT CAN AROUND THE TIME FRAME. FOR YOU HAVE MIGHT HAVE MEANT THAT WE KNOW. IN OUR- THE- IS THAT WE'RE THING OUT ONE GUY. I'M I DO WANT WANT TO HELP OPERATE I'M THE TO UNDERSTAND AND HAVE. OTHER RELATES TO OUR PROCESS AND AVOID THAT SITUATION AND WHERE THEY GREAT ON SIR WHY AT AS WAS ACT YOU BEING THERE TO- TO ANSWER MY QUESTIONS AND TO WORK THROUGH THESE ISSUES AND I WANT TO PARTNER WITH YOU ON THAT AND I CERTAINLY AGREE WITH YOU THAT CERTAINTY IN THE IS WE NEED TO. ADDRESS IS IT TOO AND SO WE CAN CREATE A FRAMEWORK THAT ALLOWS- YOU KNOW RESPONSIBLE FOR PERMITS TO MOVE FORWARD I THAT I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR AND I THINK THAT WOULD BE THE BEST THING FOR CALIFORNIA SO I APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE AND ANSWERING THE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU LOOK FOR TO WORKING TOGETHER. ASSEMBLYMEMBER RIVAS THANK YOU SECRETARY CROW FOR YOUR PRESENTATION- I JUST HAVE A FEW COMMENTS I'M MOST EXCITED BY- YOUR AXIS INEQUITY INITIATIVES- YOU KNOW YOUR- YOU KNOW MAKING SURE THAT STATE PARKS ARE ACCESSIBLE TO ALL THAT SOMETHING THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO ME YOU KNOW I'M FROM LOS ANGELES- WE NEED ACCESS TO PARKS ESPECIALLY OUR STATE PARKS AND A LOT OF TIMES IT'S TRANSPORTATION- SO I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING MORE ABOUT THE OUTDOOR EQUITY PROGRAM AND OTHER THINGS THAT YOU'RE WORKING ON. IN THAT AREA- AND ALSO- THE ELEVATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE IN YOUR AGENCY WITH THIS NEW EXECUTIVE LEVEL POSITION I ALSO LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING WHAT THIS PERSON WILL DO AND I HOPE EVERYTHING YOU IN YOUR AGENCY YOU'RE LOOKING AT AND ACCESS ADEQUATE PLAN. FOR EVERY PROGRAM THERE IS IN YOUR E. SO THANK THANK YOU TO QUIT COMMA ONE IS AYE AYE I SHOULD RECOGNIZE PARTNER JENNIFER SIEBEL NEWSOM AS A REAL DRIVER OF THIS ACCESS THAT INTO I AND SHE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY IN LAS CLASS TO REALLY ALRP THIS PRIORITY TO THE ADMINISTRATION'S YOU YOU'LL HEAR MORE IN SHE'S GOT QUITE A STRONG PARTNER US AT THE AGENCY AND IN SACKS OF THE JACK. AND THAT'S IT REALLY THE ENVIRONMENT JUSTICE PROGRAM IMPORTANT A POINT THAT WHAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO IS HIRE SOME THE AND CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT OF THIS PROGRAM INTO. WITHOUT BLOCK GAUGE I WITHIN POLDERS OUR GOAL IS TO BUILD A REALLY STRONG BROAD E. J. PROGRAM ACROSS OUR IN THE NEXT YEAR THE ONE PERSON CA ON BOARD WITH A WHOLE LOT OF PUT FROM COMMUNITY GROUPS OKAY THANK YOU. THIS GARCIA. BUT THANK YOU HEALTH ON A MY COLLEAGUES COME ON THE EACH EIGHT PIECE- IT AND THE NEED FOR OPEN SPACE AND PARKS IN MY DISTRICT AND EXCITED ABOUT THE WORK WE'VE BEEN DOING IN THE EXAM AND ABOUT THE WALKWAYS ACROSS PLACE FOR OUR WILD LIFE- AND IN PLACES LIKE OUR MOUNTAINS- I HAVE AREAS THAT WHERE CONSTITUENTS HAVE A HARD TIME CROSSING OVER TO PLACES LIKE THAT EVER BAD YEAH HI ANN ARBOR BECAUSE WE HAVE TO CROSS MULTIPLE FREEWAY ENTRANCES SINCE I HOPE WE- RIGHT SIZE THOSE WALKWAY SYSTEMS AS WE'RE DOING. SELECT WE SHOULD NOT SEEN ONE OR THE OTHER BUT EQUALLY IMPORTANT. YEAH AND I THINK I MET SAID AS THE YOU COME IN BUT WE'RE REALLY. EXCITED TO PARTNER WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON DEVELOPING A CLIMATE RESILIENCE BOND POTENTIALLY FOR CONSIDERATION IN NOVEMBER AND YOU'VE BEEN A REALLY ACT CLEAR STRONG ADVOCATE OF ENSURING THAT. WHILE OUR INVESTMENTS DO YOU HAVE TO PROTECT NATURE AND THAT'S IMPORTANT THEY NEED TO ALSO GET INTO COMMUNITIES THAT REALLY LACKED THAT ACCESS- TO HELP SORT OF BRING NATURE TO COMMUNITIES TO. CERTAINLY MISTER PATTERSON. ARE YOU ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH THE- UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY- ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF THE WATER POLICY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND ITS EFFECT ON CENTRAL CALIFORNIA I SURE AM AND THAT KIND OF MIST- WAS ABLE TO BRIEF MYSELF AND GOVERNOR NEW SOME AND THAT AND A HIGH LEVEL CABINET GROUP- UP. ON THE STUDY ABOUT A MONTH AGO. HOW WOULD YOU CHARACTERIZE THE RESULT OF THAT STUDY. I'M LOOKING FOR AN ADJECTIVE HERE YEAH. WELL I WOULD SAY. I'M I'M TRYING TO HONOR YOUR REQUEST FOR ONE ADDITIVE. HOW BOUT CATASTROPHIC. THAT COULD BE ONE I WOULD SAY TROUBLING- AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY SO. WE UNDERSTAND THAT- WATER RELIABILITY IS ALL IT IS THE LIFE BLOOD THE AGRICULTURE AND AGRICULTURE IS THE LIFEBLOOD OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY SO THEREFORE- WATER SUPPLY WATER RELIABILITY IS CRITICAL THE ECONOMIC VITALITY IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. AND MY INTERPRETATION OF THAT STUDY IS IT IDENTIFIED- SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS- TO THAT WATER SUPPLY- BOTH PRESENT AND- AND SORT OF POTENTIAL IN THE FUTURE- WHICH ONE WOULD YOU AGREE THAT THOSE ARE POLICY. CONSEQUENCES IN OTHER WORDS PEOPLE ARE MAKING THE DECISIONS THAT ARE CREATING. THE PROBLEM. ARM WELL I WOULD SAY THAT THOSE DECISIONS STARTED YOU KNOW IN YOU KNOW. WHAT LOOK I DON'T I'M NOT GOOD. I WOULD SAY THAT WELL PART OF. WHAT IS DRIVING THOUGH IT THAT IMPACT HAS BEEN THE DECADE- DEPLETION OF OUR GROUNDWATER AQUIFERS AND THE BROAD NEED THAT WE ALL RECOGNIZE TO BRING THOSE AQUIFERS BACK INTO BALANCE. I THINK- EVERYONE FROM CONGRESSMAN COST ON DOWN HAS HAS INDICATED THAT. IMPLEMENTING SIGMA IS ULTIMATELY IMPORTANT TO SECURING THOSE WATER SUPPLIES FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS OF FARMERS AND WE NEED TO DO THAT. BUT WE RECOGNIZE THAT THAT HAS REAL ECONOMIC IMPACT INCLUDING- FOLLOWING- IN IN LITTLE PORTIONS OF THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. AND IT'S WHY- THE STATE HAS INVESTED AT THIS POINT HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS INTO SUPPORTING LOCAL COMMUNITIES BUILDING THEIR OWN PLANS TO MANAGE THOSE GROUNDWATER BASINS. OB AND THEN SUPPORTING IMPLEMENTATION OF THOSE PLANS IT'S WHY WE RECOMMEND SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS A ONE TIME GENERAL FUND INTO THIS BUDGET THAT CAN GET BACK INTO THOSE COMMUNITIES VERY QUICKLY TO IMPLEMENT CIGNA. ALSO I RECOMMEND THAT FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN A NOVEMBER OBLIGATION BOND DEDICATED TO SEGMENT IMPLEMENTATION GET INTO COMMUNITY. SO NUMBER ONE IS ABSOLUTELY THAT THE- BRINGING GROUND WATER BASE THEN THE BALANCE WILL HAVE YOU CAN MAKE. IT IMPACTS. AND YET THAT WAS A POLICY DECISION ALL I THINK APOLLO DECISION THAT EVERYONE RECOGNIZES. WHICH IS TOP WATER FOR SENT COMMUNITY FOR DECADES TO COME. SEC AREA OF. COPPER THAT IS IN IS THAT LEAST AS WITH WHAT WHY. AND HOW DO WE BALANCE. THE NEED TO OF THE EXTINCTION OF OUR SAN AND WHY MAX. WATER SUPPLY REAL RELIABILITY FOR THE CENTRAL VALLEY. AND THAT'S WHY ARE OUR ADMINISTRATION HAS INVESTED A LOT OF TIME AND ENERGY IN THE LAST YEAR ON DEVELOPING THE SO CALLED VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS. THAT MEET STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS TO IMPROVE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS TO ALLOW THOSE FISH TO SURVIVE BUT IN WAYS THAT ACTUALLY WORK WITH WATER AGENCIES- IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE. TO REDUCE UNCERTAINTY OF WATER SUPPLY. SO I CAN TELL YOU THAT pANXIETY AND THE CONCERN ABOUT THE WATER SUPPLY RELY ABILITIES- ISSUE COULD YOU KNOW IT IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. AND I'M FOCUSED MYSELF PERSONALLY THROUGH THE JOB ON TRYING TO REDUCE THAT THAT WATER BY RELIABILITY. WE HAVE TO BALANCE AND GOVERNOR NEWS HIMSELF HAS BEEN VERY CLEAR ABOUT THE NEED BALLOT. OUR WATER SUPPLY I POLICY NOT LEAVE CENTRAL VALLEY BEHIND. I'M. YOU MUST OF READ A DIFFERENT REPORT THAN I DID. THE BASIC FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS HERE IS BASED ON WHAT CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS A SCHIZOPHRENIC POLICY ON THE ONE HAND THE STATE IS SAYING IF YOU PUMP THE WATER OUT YOU'VE GOT TO PUT IT BACK. AND OUT OF THE OTHER. SIDE OF THEIR MOUTH THEY'RE SAYING WE'RE GOING TO REDUCE SUBSTANTIALLY AND SIGNIFICANTLY THE SURFACE WATER THAT IS NECESSARY. TO PUT THE WATER BACK IN THE UNDERGROUND AT THAT'S NUMBER ONE THAT'S THE FUNDAMENTAL CORE POLICY THAT AS ANALYSIS AT AT THE HEART OF THIS THAT. THE IDEA THAT YOU'VE GOT TO PUT THE WATER BACK BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO GIVE YOU ENOUGH WATER TO PUT IT BACK. ARE ARE YOU NOT CONCERNED THAT THE CONCLUSIONS OF THIS FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY. THAT A MILLION ACRE FEET WILL FALLOW. THAT SOMETHING LIKE SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND JOBS WILL DISAPPEAR SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF CROP VALUE. HALF HALF A BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF LOST TAX REVENUE THAT THERE'S A REAL POTENTIAL FOR THE- AND UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IN CERTAIN AREAS OF THE OF OUR- CENTRAL CALIFORNIA. TO DOUBLE AND WITH RESPECT TO THE. IN OTHER COMMUNITIES THE AND THE INDIVIDUALS HURT BY THIS THE MOST I'M SURE YOU SAW THAT THIS IS A HIGHLY REGRESSIVE. CONSEQUENCE IN OTHER WORDS THE POOR ARE HURT MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE. AND THAT THE COMMUNITIES THE PLACES THAT THESE ARE HURT THE MOST ARE THOSE WHO NEED THE CLEAN WATER WHO NEED THE FLOWS TO GET. INTO THE UNDERGROUND RIGHT. LOOK WE ALL UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME FOLLOWING. WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS PLEASE WILL YOU LISTEN TO US A MILLION ACRE FEET IS UTTERLY CATASTROPHIC. WE'VE GOT TO HAVE THE GOVERNOR ENGAGED. AND HE'S BASICALLY GONNA HAVE TO SAY. I SERIOUSLY CARE ABOUT CENTER CALIFORNIA AND I'M GOING TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT HE HAS TO ENGAGE IN MANAGING YOUR VERY BUREAUCRACY BECAUSE IF YOU CONTINUE DOWN THIS PATH UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY SAID YOU'RE GONNA BE RESPONSIBLE. FOR A MILLION ACRES BALLOT NOW YOU THINK WE COULD GET TO A COUPLE HUNDRED THOUSAND FALLOW. IT IS ANYBODY HAVING A SERIOUS CONVERSATION WITH US ABOUT WHAT IT IS NOT THAT NOT WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO SAY ABOUT IT. BUT WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO DO. TO TURN THAT ARC AROUND FROM A MILLION ACRE FEET DRIVE IT DOWN TO SOMETHING. THAT WE CAN LIVE WITH AND I REMIND EVERYBODY HERE THIS HURTS THOSE MOST VULNERABLE THE MOST AND THAT'S THE STUDY. AND I HAD HOUR LIMIT KEEP YOUR ANSWER YEAH RELATIVELY CONSTRAINT YEAH WE DON'T HAVE TIME THIS MORNING ONLY FULL HEARING ON THIS ON THIS ISSUE AND IT DOES COME UP LATER IN THE BUDGET. YEAH LET ME JUST SAY I REGISTER YOU KNOW YOUR INTENSITY. I ON THIS FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH. YOU KNOW I BELIEVE THAT I AND WE SHARE THE INTENSITY AND WERE REALLY FOCUSED ON CONSTRUCTIVE SOLUTIONS SO FOR EXAMPLE AS IT RELATES TO THE AMOUNT OF LAND THAT FOLLOWED. I HAVE READ EVERY WORD OF THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE OF CALIFORNIA STUDY ON THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY THAT WOULD BE ISSUED OVER A YEAR AND A HALF AGO. IDENTIFIES A SIGNIFICANT DELTA. MOUNT A LAND THAT NEEDS TO BE. BASED ON- IF THE STATE CAN SUPPORT LOCAL AGENCIES DOING A FEW THINGS SO THOSE FEW THINGS ARE WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING TO FIND. IN THIS ONE TIME I- INVESTMENT OF GENERAL FUND THIS YEAR. SO I WOULD I WOULD LOVE TO SIT DOWN WITH YOUR STAFF AND GET INTO THE WEEDS A LITTLE BIT MORE. AND I CAN TELL YOU WE ARE VERY FOCUSED ON ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE. WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET INTO A IS THE P. PICK ACCURATE AND IS THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA ACCURATE. YOU TO GO BACK AND TAKE A LOOK AT THE TWENTY FOURTEEN DATA WHAT HE PUT DOWN HIS CREDENTIALS. AND HE'S PAYING A MILLION ACRE FIAT. TO GET INTO AN ARGUMENT WELL IT'S NOT REALLY A MILLION ACRES SIR WELL JUST LET US LET US. SAY AND WHEN I AM TOLD FIND IT WORK WITH YOU CONSTRUCTIVELY DETERMINES THE ONLY TIME I CAN GET IN FRONT OF PEOPLE LIKE THIS THEY DON'T GO TO MY OFFICE TO GO TO YOUR- OFFICE. THEY DON'T RESPOND THE WAY THEY RESPOND TO YOU. WILL AND SO THERE I THE ONLY TIME I HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS. I HAVE A JUNIOR SAY LOOK WHAT DO IN CENTRAL CALIFORNIA YOU'VE GOT TO BE WILLING TO SAY WE'RE GOING TO STEP BACK ON THE SIGMA AND GOING TO INCREASE THE FLOW. OR BALLOTS. THIS PATERSON ME TO SAVE. ON THE NIGHT THIS TOOK. AND I HAT. I WILL SAY PUBLICLY THE MIKE A- YOU YOU'RE OFF. ONCE TO MEET WITH ME AND MY TEAM ON THIS OR ANY OTHER MATTER. I STAND READY AND IF I FEEL IN THAT COMMITMENT YOU CAN CALL ME OUT IN THE NEXT PUBLIC SESSION AND YOU CAN CALL ME TOO IF- ANY OF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE NOT GETTING. PROPER ATTENTION FROM ANY OF OUR DEPARTMENTS. THAT'S SOMETHING I'D LIKE TO HEAR ABOUT. IT'S NOT THE. SO IF THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS SIR. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION THIS MORNING THANK YOU THERE'S LESS TO HAVE BEEN AN OVERVIEW BUT WE KIND OF DEVOLVED INTO A NUMBER OF- VERY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS VERY IMPORTANT ISSUES THAT WE COVERED- AT THE ONLY THING I WANTED TO MENTION TO YOU. OF A MISTER CRAWFORD IS SOME I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF FOR ACCESS AND THE- PARKS FOR ALL PROGRAM I THINK IS GOING TO BE. A GREAT SUCCESS AND- ALLOW- MANY MORE PEOPLE FROM AROUND THE STATE TO ACCESS- A- ARE INCREDIBLE STATE PARK SYSTEM- IN THE BUDGET IS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR A NEW. STATE PARK AND WE HAVE. BASICALLY NO INFORMATION OF ABOUT THAT. I CAN'T IN GOOD CONSCIENCE MOVE A BUDGET ITEM FOR WOULD WITHOUT HAVING DETAIL ABOUT IT SO PLEASE KEEP THAT IN MIND. WE UNDERSTAND THAT AND JUST BECAUSE SOME- MEMBERS DIDN'T COME IN- WHEN I WAS WOOD. SHARE THIS WHICH AS YOU CAN HEAR A LOT OF DETAILS IN COMING WEEKS FROM OUR DEPARTMENTS- AND- THE- THE PROGRAM LEADERS IN THOSE DEPARTMENTS. IF IT'S HELPFUL FOR ME TO GET ENGAGED ANY OF THE DISCUSSIONS JUST PLEASE REACH OUT I WANT TO BE AS INVOLVED AS YOU WANT ME TO BE PLEASE BEAR IN MIND THAT WE NEED TO HEAR THAT DETAIL. IN TIME TO PROVIDE APPROPRIATE FOR SITE- AND ANALYSIS AND IF IT COMES TO US- YOU KNOW IT MAY REVISE OR OR OR LATE IN THE GAME. IT'S A GOOD SITUATION. UNDERSTOOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WELL WE HAVEN'T EVEN- ESTABLISHED A QUORUM SO PLENTIFULLY BUT WE DO THAT. BLOOM HERE FONG GARCIA MULLIN PATTERSON RAY YES RIVAS HERE. ALL RIGHT- ARE WE READY TO MOVE THE BUT ONLY CALENDAR. I'LL ENTERTAIN A MOTION TO APPROVE THE VOTER ONLY CALENDAR. YOU GUYS WILL HAVE TO COLLECT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT OKAY LET SET TABLE THAT FOR A FEW MOMENTS WE'LL GET ORGANIZED NO PROBLEM. YEAH THE MUSIC IS TOO MANY TABLES. YEAH THERE THESE FOLKS ARE READY TO PROCEED MORE RUN A LITTLE BIT BEHIND SCHEDULE SO- LET'S THE PROCEED HERE FROM THE AND- NATURAL SOURCES AGENCY ON A LOT MORE DETAIL ON A COUPLE OF ITEMS OKAY THANK YOU AND WELCOME. THEM BRING CASH FROM THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY- HERE TO PRESENT ON OUR LIGHT OUR PROPOSAL IS MARK GOLD WHO IS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL AND NATHAN ROCKS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION. WELCOME THANK YOU CHAIRMAN BLOOM HONOR COMMITTEE MEMBERS IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE ON THE TH ANNUAL ROTH THE GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION OFFICER FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION I'M HERE TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT LEAD DETECTION AND RANGING OR LIGHTER WHICH IS THE PREFERRED METHOD FOR DETAILED MAPPING OF A LANDSCAPE IN THREE DIMENSIONS IT HAS WIDE APPLICABILITY TO MAPPING VEGETATION PARTICULARLY FORESTRY GEOLOGY HYDROLOGY AND HUMAN STRUCTURES FOR PLANNING MONITORING AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE. PRODUCTS WITH IMMEDIATE UTILITY INCLUDE THE TOPOGRAPHY ENTRY IN BUILDING HEIGHTS OTHER DERIVED PRODUCTS. THAT WILL BE PREPARED MAY INCLUDE BUILDING SIZE AND A VARIETY OF VEGETATION METRICS. WHILE USING RAW LIDAR DATA WILL REQUIRE TRAINING FOR STAFF. MOST ANALYSTS WILL USE DERIVED PRODUCTS THAT CAN BE USED DIRECTLY IN EXISTING MAPPING AND ANALYTICAL TOOLS WITH MINIMAL TRAINING. THE EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS REQUESTED WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO COMPLETE COVERAGE OF CALIFORNIA ONE. IF THE IF FUNDS FROM FEDERAL AGENCIES OR OTHER PARTNERS ALLOW COMPLETING THE COLLECTION AT A LOWER COST TO THE STATE THE EXCESS FUNDS ARE INTENDED TO BE USED TO IMPROVE THE DELIVER PRODUCTS. SELECT SUPPORTING DATA PROVIDE TRAINING AND EXPAND OUR ANALYTICAL AND DATA DISTRIBUTION INFRASTRUCTURE. THE US GEOLOGICAL SURVEY GENERALLY TARGETED EIGHT YEAR REPEAT CYCLE FOR COLLECTIONS. IN REALITY THAT UPDATE FREQUENCY SHOULD BE DRIVEN. BY THE UNDERLYING LANDSCAPE AND ITS NEEDS. TOTAL COST REPEAT COVERAGE OF THE FULL STATE WILL LIKELY BE STE WOULD LIKELY BE SIMILAR TO AN INITIAL COLLECTION. THE PROBABLY PHASED OUT OVER TIME. THE COLLECTION WILL BE GOVERNED BY AN EXECUTIVE BOARD WITH MEMBERSHIP FROM LIGHT ARE USING DEPARTMENTS ACROSS THE STATE. AND THE TECHNICAL WORKING GROUP. THAT WILL COMPLETE DETAILED PLANNING AND EXECUTION UPON APPROVAL BY THE BOARD. THANK YOU AND ALLOW LIKE TO PASS THE UP TO THE PODIUM TO MARK GOLD. DEPUTY SECRETARY FOR OCEANS AND COASTAL POLICY. GOOD MORNING ON THANK YOU CHAIRMAN BLOOM AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I AM THRILLED TO BE HERE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT ANOTHER CRITICAL APPROACH TO MODERNIZING CALIFORNIA'S NOW TO RESOURCE MANAGEMENT. LIGHT ARE. LIGHTER IS ESSENTIAL FOR BETTER PROTECTING LIFE AND PROPERTY THE INFORMATION ABLE TO US TO BETTER ASSESS FUEL AND FIRE RISK POTENTIAL AND FORCE AND pUNDERSTAND HOW WATERSHEDS CHANGE OVER TIME EROSION AND SUBSIDENCE. AN ESSENTIAL NEED FOR BETTER PROTECTING STRUCTURES FROM FLOODING. IN FOR BETTER MANAGING OUR WATER SUPPLIES. LIGHT ARE HELPS US MAP LANDSLIDES AND DETERMINE WHICH COASTLINES AND BEACHES ARE MOST AT RISK FROM COASTAL ROADS AND SEA LEVEL RISE. LIGHT ARE PROVIDE THIS ESSENTIAL INFORMATION FOR IDENTIFYING VEGETATION TYPES AND HOW TO BEST RESTORE WETLANDS AND STREAMS. AND IN CITIES LIDAR DATA CAN DETERMINE TREE CANOPY SOLAR POTENTIAL EFFICACY OF TURF FOR PLACEMENT PROGRAMS AND THE LOCATION OF HEAT ISLANDS. AND WITH THE POTENTIAL GENEROUS MATCH FROM U. S. G. S. WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET LAW A LOT MORE BANG FOR OUR BUCK. WITH THE EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET IF USGS MATCHES CALIFORNIA'S CONTRIBUTION AT FORTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR EXAMPLE. THAT MEANS THERE COULD BE UP TO FORTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT COULD BE USED FOR ADDITIONAL REMOTE SENSING FROM SATELLITES AND AIRCRAFT. SATELLITE DATA THAT PROVIDES US WITH MULTI SPECTRAL ARE HYPERSPECTRAL ANALYSIS CAN BE OF GREAT BENEFIT COUPLED WITH LIDAR DATA. FOR EXAMPLE. LIGHTER WILL TELL US ABOUT THE THREE DIMENSIONAL VEGETATION COVERAGE IN OUR FORESTS CHAPARRAL WOODLANDS OR GRASSLANDS. BUT AND DVI THE NORMALIZED DIFFERENCE VEGETATION INDEX WHICH IS VISIBLE LIGHT AND INFRARED SPECTRUM LIGHT WAY BLANKS. ON MEASUREMENTS FROM SATELLITES ENABLE US TO COMBINE THE DATA TO DETERMINE DROUGHT IMPACTS. ON POTENTIAL FIRE RISK AREAS TO PRIORITIZE BY THOSE FIRE RISK AREAS. AND EVEN ON MAKE FIRE BEHAVIOR PREDICTIONS. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS THE USE OF LIDAR IN INDIA V. I. IN CITIES TO HELP US DETERMINE HOW DROUGHT IS IMPACTING TREE CANOPY. AND LANDSCAPE VEGETATION. LIGHTER WITH SATELLITE TEMPERATURE MEASUREMENTS CAN ENABLE US TO KEEP CLOSER TRACK OF POTENTIAL HEAT ISLAND HOT SPOTS THAT POSE HEALTH RISKS TO THE PUBLIC AND HOW INTERVENTIONS LIKE INCREASE TREE CANOPY COOL ROOFS AND COAL PAYMENTS CAN REDUCE THE IMPACTS OF THESE HEAT ISLANDS. REMOTE SENSING FROM SATELLITES DOESN'T PROVIDE THE RESOLUTION OR NECESSARILY MEASURE THE SAME THINGS AS LIGHT ARE. BUT PROVIDES US WITH MORE FREQUENT MEASUREMENTS UP TO MULTIPLE TIMES PER DAY FREQUENTLY WEEKLY. OF A LARGE VARIETY OF PARAMETERS INCLUDING KELP CANOPY WHICH- THE SECRETARY TALKED ABOUT EARLIER HORIZONTAL BEACH PROFILE CHANGES GREENNESS MEAN IT OUT WHICH IS IMPORTANT FOR DROUGHT ASSESSMENT. LOCATIONS OF HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS THE TRANSPORT OF POLLUTED RUNOFF AND SENTIMENT PLANS IN THE OCEAN. LAND SURFACE TEMPERATURES AT A THIRTY METER SCALE. SERVICE MINERAL TYPES AND MINE WASTE IMPACTS AND MORE. ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING- WITH OUR FELLOW STAFF WITH JPL NASA U. S. YES THE UC SYSTEM NATIONAL LABS AND OTHERS TO MAKE SURE THAT CALIFORNIA'S GETTING THE BEST AVAILABLE DATA TO HELP US MANAGE CALIFORNIA'S NATURAL RESOURCES AND BETTER PROTECT LIFE AND PROPERTY. THESE DATA SOURCES AND WORKING RELATIONSHIPS WILL ENABLE CALIFORNIA TO DO A MUCH BETTER JOB OF PROTECTING OUR NATURAL RESOURCES WHILE COAST AND COASTAL WATERS YOU CAN LIVE AND PRETTY AND HAVE ANSWER QUESTION YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU. THANK I DID WANT TO ASK. IF BUT- THERE'RE IS PRECEDENCE ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD FOR INSTALLATION OF LIGHT ARE ON THE SCALE THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THERE IS- THE MAJORITY OF THE EAST COAST OF THE U. S. HAS COVERED LARGE PORTIONS OF THAT WERE HEAVILY FUNDED- POST DISASTER. LOST SEVERAL OTHER STATES ARE WELL IN PROGRESS TOWARDS COMPLETING STATEWIDE LIGHTER COVERAGE. INDIANA IN PARTICULAR HAS COMPLETED IT. LAW AND IS STARTING TO CONSIDER- REPEAT COVERAGE FLORIDA IS ABOUT TO COMPLETE- COVERAGE AND THERE IS AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OTHER STATES- QUITE LITERALLY I WAS TALKING WITH THAT. IT'S ACTUALLY MY PEERS ACROSS OTHER STATES- MONDAY AND TUESDAY THAT ARE IN A VERY PARALLEL PLANNING PROCESS FOR THE COLLECTION OF THIS DATA FOR STATES ACROSS THE US. AND THE A DO WE HAVE AN AGREEMENT IN PLACE WITH USGS OR- IS IT PRESUME THAT THEY'LL PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING. WE HAVE- A HISTORY OF WORKING OUT AGREEMENTS WITH THEM THROUGH THEIR THREE D. ELEVATION PROGRAM TO FIND- ASSORTMENTS OF SMALLER. DATA COLLECTIONS WE HAVE A COUPLE PROJECTS IN PROGRESS RIGHT NOW THAT WOULD NOT BE NEED AND WHAT NOT NEED TO BE RE COLLECTED- AT. ALL OF THESE WORKING THROUGH THEIR ESTABLISHED PRIDE AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT PROCESS FOR COLLECTING AND DRESSED. FROM STATES OR OTHER PARTNERS- TO COLLECT FEDERAL. BUNDLED INTERESTED IN IN COMPLETING THIS PART PROJECTS. THANK YOU- LA- I KNOW YOU WANT 2% ON THIS. JUST THE COMPUTERS WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND IT'S SO IN REVIEWING THE PROPOSAL AND WE DO FIND THAT THAT CONCEPT OF- COLLECTING LIDAR DATA ON THE STATE ON APPEARS POMISING- AS AND THAT THE AGENCY REPRESENTATIVES HAVE TESTIFIED. AND THERE'S A LOT OF POTENTIAL AND IT REALLY INTERESTING AND INNOVATIVE USES- OF FOR THIS DATA AND HOWEVER AND WE RAISED SOME CONCERNS THAT THE PROPOSAL MIGHT BE PREMATURE AND IS SO AS WAS TESTIFIED TO PREVIOUSLY THERE IS A WORKING GROUP THAT THAT AGENCY IS DEVELOPING. ON TO LOOK AT EXACTLY HOW THE DATA WOULD BE HUGHES WE FEEL THAT INFORMATION IS ACTUALLY REALLY NECESSARY BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE MOVES FORWARD IT WITH ACTUALLY APPROVING A SPENDING EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR A ONE TIME DATA COLLECTION AND IS SORT OF A HIGH COST. AND IT'S SORT OF UNCLEAR AT THIS POINT EXACTLY HOW THE VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS IN THE STATE OR LOCAL PARTNERS OR JUST MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC COULD HAVE ACCESS TO THIS DATA WOULD REALLY UTILIZE. ON THIS COULD REQUIRES CERTAIN PROGRAMMATIC SHIFT CHANGES WITHIN VARIOUS STATE DEPARTMENTS. IN TERMS OF HOW THEY'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO AND TAKE THE DATE AND CHANGE THE WAY THEY MAKE DECISIONS ON. FOR EXAMPLE WHICH EXPENSE WE FIND FOR FOREST HEALTH PROJECTS- OR HOW THEY'RE MAKING CERTAIN PLANNING DECISIONS ON FOR FUTURE PROJECTS AND SO WITHOUT HAVING A GOOD IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY WE FEEL THAT THEPROPOSAL'S PRETEND POTENTIALLY PREMATURE. GIVEN THE HIGH COST I THINK AND IT WAS TESTIFIED TO THAT U. S. G. S. TYPICALLY LIKES TO SEE AN EIGHT YEAR CYCLE OF RE COLLECTING THE DATA IN OUR DISCUSSION WITH THE AGENCY IT SOUND LIKE. THIS INITIAL PASSIVE DATA WILL TAKE THE FIVE. SO BY THE TIME YOU GET TO THE END OF THE AND COLLECTION OF DATA YOU'RE GOING TO BE COMING UP ON THIS CYCLE OF NEEDING TO REFRESH THAT DATA. AND SO IT'S GOING TO BE. WEAK THANKS FOR THE AGENCY. TO PRESENT INFORMATION TO THE LEGISLATURE ON WHAT ARE THE SPECIFIC USES SOME OF THOSE USES AND THAT HE COULDN'T REQUIRE KNEADING THE DATA TO BE REFRESHED VERY FREQUENTLY- OTHERS MAYBE THEY DATA DOESN'T NEED TO BE REFRESHED AS OFTEN. BUT BEFORE YOU COMMIT TO DOING THIS YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO HAVE A SENSE OF WHAT EXACTLY ON IS THIS GOING TO BE USED FOR HOW IS THIS GOING TO FILTER DOWN INTO PROGRAMMATIC CHANGES. AND BETTER DECISION MAKING ON THE PART OF STATE ENTITIES AND FOR THOSE PROGRAMS THAT REALLY HAVE A PROCESS IN PLACE TO UTILIZE THIS BETTER DATA. HOW OFTEN IS THAT GOING TO HAVE TO BE REFRESHED IS THIS GOING TO BE SOMETHING WHERE THE LEGISLATURE IS REALLY GOING TO NEED TO APPROVE ANOTHER EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS IN THE NEXT FIVE TO TEN YEARS TO CONTINUE THE DATA- OR THEIR OPPORTUNITIES TO MAYBE. FOCUS IT ON HIGH JUST SORT OF HIGH PRIORITY AREAS WHERE THAT THE STATE IS ALREADY MORE GEARED UP TO BE ABLE TO USE THE DATA. SO BECAUSE OF ALL THAT WE RECOMMEND WITHHOLDING ACTION ON THIS I BELIEVE IT COME AND PULL THIS THEM OPEN TO A- I'M AND- I COMMEND. YOU SEE REPORT BACK WITHOUT MORE ROBUST IMPLEMENTATION PLAN THEY'RE IN THE PROCESS OF MOVING TO THE X. THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE ROBUST IMPLEMENT. A PLAN TO YOU. IS BY CYCLE THEN WITH COLLECTION REJECTING PULLS UP AND ASKING THEM TO COME BACK IN A WHEN THEY HAVE A MORE FULLY DEVELOPED PROPOSAL. SO THINK THE DOCTOR PREPARE TO RE. TO MAKE. UNDERSTAND THE ORIGINAL FROM THE PRESENTATION THAT YOU MADE DR GOLD TO THAT YOU WERE. RATHER SPECIFIC ABOUT THE A VARIETY OF USES THAT- THAT THE LIGHT ARE- CAN CAN BE HELPFUL WITH. I HINK WHAT I'M HEARING FROM LA- WHAT WE'RE HEARING FROM LA- IS THAT IT WOULD ALSO BE HELPFUL TO HAVE A BREAK DOWN ON WHEN THE REFRESH DATES FOR EACH OF THOSE USES- WOULD BE AT THAT WOULD BE IN ORDER. AND JUST PROGRAMMATIC LEE HOW THIS PROGRAM IT IS A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT'S BEING ASKED FOR. IT IS A NEW PROGRAM SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE IT GETS OFF THE OFF THE GROUND TO A SUCCESSFULLY. OF HOW WOULD YOU SUGGEST WE GO ABOUT DOING THAT AND- YOU. WILL HAVE PLENTY OF TIME BETWEEN NOW AND A REVISED- TO- COME BACK WITH MORE DETAILED INFORMATION BUT- GIVE US AN OVERVIEW ON THAT NOW THAT WOULD BE GREAT. SO OUR ALL STAR DONE EMPLOYED PASSING OVER BET ON BREAK IT UP INTO A WALL JACK LIFE. ON SO- THANK YOU I HE MIGHT MY REMARKS ARE ACTUALLY MADE ON. KNOWING WHAT THE LA KNOWS- COMMENTS WERE IN IN SO I REALLY WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT THOSE USES AND THAT THESE ARE YOU SAYS. THAT ON. THE BEING USED TODAY THIS IT'S NOT PREMATURE IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM THIS IS EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS USING THE BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE TO GET US THERE. I'M IT JUST SO HAPPENS THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER USES FOR LIGHT ARE OTHER THAN EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS BUT WE COULD SPEND. OUR WHOLE TIME TALKING ABOUT WALL SUBSIDENCE WHAT IS THAT GOING TO DO TO OUR WATER INFRASTRUCTURE WHAT IT YOU KNOW WHAT- WE HAVE CLIP CORROSION PROBLEMS THE IF YOU LOOK AT THE SAN DIEGO AREA. ON YOU HAVE INVESTMENT IN THAT REGION THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE ACTUALLY DOING WHAT OUR FARM OR FREQUENTLY BECAUSE THEY'RE SEEN AND IS. ARE CURRENTLY AND- STRUCK OF THE COST GEOLOGY. ON SUCH A FREAK BASIS AND AN WE'VE ALL BEEN FOLLOWING ON THE- DOWN THERE. ON IT WE DON'T NEED TO TALK ABOUT WITHOUT FIRE IN THIS GROUP FROM THE STATE YOU KNOW FROM THE STANDPOINT OF WHAT RISKS ARE. AND HOW THIS HELPS. IT'S NOT. THE REASON WHY I TALKED ABOUT LINKING WITH OTHER SETS OF INFORMATION YOU CAN'T JUST LOOK AT LINE ARE ALONE. IN A BOX RIGHT IT HAS TO BE USED IN CONJUNCTION. WITH OTHER SORTS OF TOOLS TO REALLY GET THE MOST OUT OF IT AND THAT'S WHY I GAVE SOME VERY COMMON SENSE. EVERY DAY SORTS. OF USES AT THE AT ON THE ARE WOULD BE WITH WITH ON SET. AND OTHER% FIXED WING. ON ERR AIRBORNE. WERE ABOUT A REMOTE SENSING TECHNIQUES. ON THE COULD BE TREMENDOUS VALUE WHETHER YOU LIVE IN A CITY OR WHERE DO YOU LIVE ON THE COAST BUT WHAT DO YOU LIVE IN A FORESTED AREA OR AN AREA PRONE TO FIRE THERE THERE'S- THE USES. ON OUR OUR ABSOLUTELY. ON ESSENTIAL FOR THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PROTECTION. OF PUBLIC HEALTH FROM THE STANDPOINT OF NEXT STEPS I'M GONNA PASS ON TO MY- IT CAN YOU ALSO- ADDRESSED THE NOTION OF- WHETHER- THIS IS TIMELY OR PERHAPS A LITTLE BIT PREMATURE I THINK THAT WAS WHAT. ANOTHER POINT THE ALEJO YEAH I THINK THAT WAS MY POINT WAS IT'S NEVER PREMATURE TO BE MOREPREPARED FOR AN EMERGENCY. ON IN AND I THINK THAT'S THAT'S REALLY WHAT THIS IS ABOUT AND THIS IS GOING TO HELP US. IN EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS AND ABOUTA HUNDRED DIFFERENT WAYS ON AND THAT'S THAT'S A REALLY ONE EMPHASIZE THAT PART. ON IN IT HELPS US ON CLIMATE ADAPTATION WHICH IS YOU HEARD FROM THE SECRETARY. IS YOU KNOW ONE OF THE BIGGEST PRIORITIES OF THIS ADMINISTRATION IS TO MOVE FORWARD ON. SO ONE OF THE KEY PIECES I'D LIKE TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT WE GET OUT ON THE TABLE. IS LIGHT ARE- IS A NEW BUZZWORD. BUT IT'S NOT NECESSARILY NEW TECHNOLOGY. IT IS EXISTED AND BEEN IN ACTIVE USE FOR A LONG TIME. WHAT'S CAUGHT UP. IS THE REST OF OUR COMPUTING POWER. THE UNIVERSITY'S TRAINING STAFF ON HOW TO MAKE FULL USE OF IT- THE ABILITY FOR. US TO STORE TRANSMIT. A PROCESS PARTICULAR WITH SOME OF THE MACHINE LEARNING AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TYPE TECHNIQUES. TO REALLY DERIVE THE DEEPEST SETS OF. INFORMATION PRODUCTS THAT WE CAN FROM THE DATA IT'S OUR GEOLOGISTS IS- IN THE DEPARTMENT CONSERVATION EVERYWHERE THAT THEY CAN LAY THEIR HANDS ON IT RIGHT NOW THEY ARE PULLING THIS DATA AND FOUR LANDSLIDE MAPPING FOR THE REVIEW OF TIMBER HARVEST PLANS FOR THE IDENTIFICATION OF FAULT NOT FAULT AREAS THAT MAY MAY POSE A RISK. HI IT IS IN VERY ACTIVE USE RIGHT NOW WHEREVER THEY CAN LAY THEIR HANDS ON IT HI AND THERE ARE MANY PORTIONS OF THE STATE FOR WHICH IT IS NOT AVAILABLE- THAT- NOW'S THE TIME I BELIEVE FOR US TO GET AHEAD OF THAT BALL SO THAT WE CAN START BUILDING THOSE INFORMATION PRODUCTS TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS MORE EFFECTIVELY. BUT BEEN RESPONDING ON THE NEXT STEPS TO SELF SAY WHATEVER REACTIONS WILL BE DEBT SO NEXT NEXT STEPS UP. TRY TO GET TRY TO BRING THE DATA IN HOUSE SO THAT WE CAN BUILD THIS PRODUCTS GET THEM INTO THE DECISION MAKING PROCESSES TRACK HOW THOSE DECISION MAKING PROCESSES. ARE CHANGING SO THAT WE CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT OUR RETURN ON INVESTMENT IS FORCE THIS COLLECTION. AND FORECAST MORE EFFECTIVELY WHAT THOSE WILL BE FOR ANY FUTURE COLLECTIONS INCLUDING THE PHASING THAT MAY BE NECESSARY. IN ORDER TO- TO ACCOMMODATE- THE HIGHEST VALUE FOR REPEAT COVERAGE CYCLES- ACROSS THE STATE IS HEALTHCARE BUT I THINK IN A NUTSHELL WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS WE'RE WILLING TO WORK WITH STAFF AND WITH THE LA TO GET THE COMMITTEE THE INFORMATION THAT THEY NEED. THANK YOU VERY CONCISE. THIS IS A TOPIC REMINDS ME A LITTLE BIT OF- OF- THE DEVELOPMENT OF LASER TECHNOLOGY MANY DECADES AGO WHICH I THINK WAS- A FIRST INVENTED BACK ENOUGH IN THE FIFTIES BUT IT DIDN'T REALLY- START TO BECOME BROADLY USED TO UNTIL THE SEVENTIES AND THEN THERE WAS AN EXPLOSION OF USES IN TODAY'S TECHNOLOGICAL WORLD- LIGHT ARE- ISN'T NEW BUT IT'S ALSO NOT THAT OLD YET AND- WE'RE EXPERIENCING NOW I THINK AN EXPLOSION IS AT AND IT'S IMPORTANT VEHICLES. EXACTLY YEAH. OF AND THE- SO IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO GET RIGHT AND TO- WE ONLY HAVE A LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME IN THE BUDGET PROCESS TO DO THAT I KNOW YOU'VE GIVEN A LOT OF THOUGHT SO I'M GLAD THAT CONVERSATION WILL TAKE PLACE BETWEEN NOW AND THE- OUT WHEN THIS COMES BACK WE WILL BE- HOLDING THIS ITEM OPEN SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE PRESENTATION ON IT- I WILL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT AT- AFTER- ISSUE NUMBER TWO I DON'T THINK THAT WAS GOING TO TAKE TOO LONG- YOU'RE GONNA GIVE ME AN UPDATE ON US AN UPDATE ON THE- RELOCATION OF THE- HEADQUARTERS. AND I WALKED BY IT TO ALMOST EVERY DAY AS I COME A BACK AND FORTH FROM- MY HOME- TO THE CAPITAL SO I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE IS PROGRESS BEING THE CLADDING ON THE BUILDING GO UP. BRING CASH AGAIN FROM THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY WE'RE REQUESTING NINE POINT SIX MILLIONDOLLARS- FOR ALL THE REQUIRED ELEMENTS. FOR THE RELOCATION AND TO THE NEW NATURAL RESOURCES HEADQUARTERS BUILDING AND ALSO RELOCATING OUR CHEER THREE DATA CENTER. TO A NEW LOCATION- THE PROPOSAL AS THREE ELEMENTS OF THE FIRST ELEMENT IS- TWO POINT SIX MILLION FOR THE- TECHNICAL NETWORKING INVOICE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE BUILDING- THE CLERK TOTAL COSTS FOR THIS IS FIVE POINT THREE MILLION BUT THE AGENCIES. ARE ALREADY CONTRIBUTING 50% OF THAT COST- THE SECOND IS RE CLOSE RELOCATING ARTS HERE THREE DATACENTER AND THE COST FOR THAT IS ONE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS- THE COSTS WERE- ESTIMATED BY AN INDEPENDENT PARTY IN. AND APPROVED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY. AND THEN FIVE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR DECOMMISSIONING. THE CURRENT BUILDING ALL THE- EQUIPMENT AND INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IN THERE AND THEN MOVING WHAT WE NEED INTO THE NEW BUILDING- WE WORKED HARD WITH INVESTMENT GIVEN BY THE- LEGISLATURE LAST YEAR TO DID TIES. LEAVE ARE RIGHT. IN THE MID MIDDLE OF DOING THAT. THE COST FOR THE MOVE OUR LOT LESS THAN WHAT THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN IF WE ACTUALLY HAD- ALL THAT PAPER TO MOVE WITH US SO WE'RE REALLY WORKING TO. CHANGE OUR BUSINESS PROCESSES SO THAT WERE MOVING TO A MORE DIGITAL MORE MODERN WORK SPACE- THROUGH THIS MOVE TO THE NEW BUILDING. GREAT THANK YOU LA OUR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. ANY QUESTIONS WILL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT NOW ON- ISSUES WANTED TO. IF THERE IS ANY. OKAY CENTER. CONCISE PUBLIC COMMENT IS GREATLY APPRECIATED WELCOME- THANK YOU CHAIRMAN BLOOM AND- COMMITTEE I WANT TO SPEAK TO THEM THE LIGHT UP BY YOURSELF AND- YOU'RE REPRESENTING MY NAME IS GREG SUMA I'M THE CONSERVATION BIOLOGIST FOR A GROUP CALLED HERE FORCE LEGACY WHERE GROUP THAT LOOKS IT- HOLD FORCED CONDITIONS IN THE SIERRA NEVADA. AND I WANT TO SPEAK TO LIGHT ARE OF THE ALLIED OUR ITEM BASICALLY TO SUPPORT- A LOT OF WHAT IS WAS SAID FIRST OF ALL- IT'S A NEW TOOL IT'S A NEW SET OF EYE GLASSES FOR- NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT NET THAT MAY SOUND DIMINUTIVE BUT IT IS IT BRINGS US INTO THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY IN TERMS OF. IDENTIFYING THE STRUCTURE OF VEGETATION ON THE GROUND WHICH IS IMPORTANT WHEN WEAR IDENTIFYING IN IMPORTANT COMPONENTS FOR WILDLIFE WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT HOW TO- DESIGN A STRICT NETWORK OF STRATEGIC FUEL BREAKS ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE BECAUSE BOTH NATIONAL FOREST IN AND PRIVATE LANDS IN STATE OWNED LANDS- AND PRESCRIPTIONS FOR HOW TO THIN FORCED ECOLOGICALLY THAT ALSO PROVIDED FIRE HAZARD- REDUCTION SO HOW DO WE DO THAT. AND HOW DOES LIGHT ARE IMPROVE OUR ABILITY TO DO THAT IT GIVES US. A THREE DIMENSIONAL VIEW AT A VERY FINE SCALE THAT ALLOWS US TO GET DOWN TO ACRE AND SO BAKER- DESIGNS OF OUR TREATMENTS. THAT PREVIOUSLY WOULD HAVE BEEN AN ITERATIVE PROCESS USING WHAT SOMEONE CALL I'D ARE WE CAN WE JUMP TO LIGHT ARE UP LET ME GIVE YOU ONE SPECIFIC EXAMPLE IN MY CASE. WORKING WITH THE ELDORADO NATIONAL FOREST IN THE LAST THREE YEARS. WORK THAT HAS STARTED IN- THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA THE ACADEMICS LOOKING AT- WILDLIFE BEHAVIOR THIS CASE CALIFORNIA SPOTTED OWL AND THEN COMPARING THAT TO NEW LIGHT OUR INFORMATION THAT'S AVAILABLE. WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO OUR S. RESEARCHERS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO IDENTIFY. AT A SO BAKER SCALE. THE HIGH CANOPY TOLD THREE ELEMENTS OF A FOREST THAT THE SPOTTED OWLS ARE ABSOLUTELY USING FOR THEIR NESTING. SO NOW WITH LIGHT ARE WHERE LIGHTERS AVAILABLE WE CAN PICK THOSE COMPONENTS OUT. SO THAT WAS THE RESURGENT TWENTY SEVENTEEN THAT IS NOW DOWN SCALED DOWN TO ACTUALLY TRYING TO GET IT DOWN THE FIELD. GETTING PRACTITIONERS TO USE LIGHT ARE WHERE IT'S AVAILABLE TO FIRST PICK OUT THOSE ELEMENTS WHERE TIMBER HARVESTING AND COMMERCIAL THINNING AND FUEL REDUCTION IS PLANNED. AND FIND THOSE ELEMENTS AND CREATE NEW TREATMENTS AROUND WHERE THOSE ARE IN A MORE EFFECTIVE AND EXPEDITIOUS WAY WHICH LASTLY ALL SAY. THAT IS COMMENSURATE WITH THE URGENCY THAT WE NEED WITH WHICH WE NEED TO DO THESE FUEL HAZARD TREATMENTS. THANK YOU SO IS GREATLY SUPPORT THIS AND NOT PREMATURE WE SHOULD GET IT INTO THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. GOOD MORNING MR MERGE THE COMMITTEE UNFETTERED OF ON THE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA NATIVE PLANT SOCIETY I THINK GREG JUST BLEW ME OUT OF THE WATER AS FAR AS LIKE LONG TESTIMONY. SO KUDOS TO HIM BUT ALSO DID- EVERYTHING THAT YOU CAN SET YOUR COMMENTS SHORT TO KEEP IT SHORT EXACTLY- AS A NON SCIENTIST YOU KNOW I JUST REALLY WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE BENEFITS OF HAVING THIS LIGHT OUR DATA FOR THE STATE IN AN ACCESSIBLE FORMAT. BUT NGOS IN NON PROFITS IN UNIVERSITIES CAN ACCESS IS GOING TO BE CRITICAL FOR MANY THINGS FROM CARBON ACCOUNTING TO WATER MANAGEMENT. TO HABITAT CONSERVATION CONNECTIVITY- BETTER UNDERSTANDING URBAN TREE CANOPY AND URBAN AND RURAL AREAS LIKE THE BENEFITS ARE A MANY FOLD- AND REALLY WANTED TO STRESS THAT. WE HAD REALLY GOOD CONVERSATIONS WITH THE RESOURCES AGENCY WITH MISTER CASH MISTER GOLDIN OTHERS- THAT BEEN REALLY HEAVILY INVOLVED IN DIGGING INTO THE WEEDS OF IT ALL. AND EVERYTHING THAT WE'VE HEARD IT HAS HAS REALLY HELPED US UNDERSTAND BETTER WHAT IS BEING PROPOSED AND THE USEFULNESS OF THESE TYPE INVESTMENTS WOULD LOVE TO SEE THESE GO FORWARD. WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE CHALLENGES THE COMPLICATION IS REALLY BROWN FUNDING AND OF COURSE. WE WOULD LOVE TO BE AT THE TABLE TO OFFER ACCOMMODATIONS ON THE FUNDING QUESTIONS AS WELL THANK YOU. ONE GERMAN BLOOM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. TO THE PACIFIC FOREST TRUST ALSO VERY SUPPORTIVE- LETTERS TO TREMENDOUS ADVANCE IN TERMS OF OUR ABILITY TO DO THE PLANNING AS MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ALREADY SAID. WHICH IMMENSELY USEFUL AND- WATERSHED RESTORATION WORK THAT YOU'RE CARRYING MISTER- MISTER BLOOM- SO IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS WE WISH WE ALREADY HAD TODAY. SO I WOULD REALLY URGE US TO MOVE FORWARD WITH AND THIS BUDGET CYCLE IT'S ABSOLUTELY REASONABLE TO. HOLD THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE FIRE FOR BETTER PLANNING BUT WE REALLY DO. WISH WE HAD THIS MOUSE LET'S NOT LOSE ANY MORE TIME TOWARDS GETTING. THIS TOOL TO INFORM OUR OUR WORK ON THE STATE THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING ROBERT GORE FROM MIKE WALKER GROUP ON BEHALF OF THE KINGS RIVER CONSERVATION DISTRICT WITH ONE POINT TWO MILLION ACRES UNDER MANAGEMENT. KINGS RIVER INTO EIGHBORING YOU'RE ADDITION DISTRICTS HAVE BEEN WORKING FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS WITH NASA. ON LIDAR- AS THE RESULT HAS BEEN TO CREATE A MINIMUM OF TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND ACRE FEET OF NEW WATER. THIS HELPS CONTRIBUTE AND WILL TO A DRINKING WATER FOR DAX. SO LIGHT OURS IN USE- WE WOULD LIKE TO HELP WITH THIS SO PROPOSAL BECAUSE- NOW SAYS DETERMINE THE EXPERIMENT TO BE INTERNET AND IT HAS WALKED AWAY. OF THE OF THE SORT OF FIND IT IS DESPERATELY NEEDED TO PRESERVE EXISTING DATA. IN PROGRAM THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING KIM DELFINO REPRESENTING DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE- WERE PART OF THE CONSERVATION ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE MET WITH AND TALKED WITH DEPARTMENT CONSERVATION RESOURCES AND WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL. I THINK IT'S BEEN NOTED- WHAT THE BENEFITS ARE IT IS LONG OVERDUE- OUR EXPERIENCE PARTICULARLY WITH LIGHT ARE A GOES ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE USE OF IT. TO MAP OUT VERNAL POOLS AND CENTRAL VALLEY WAS AN INCREDIBLE- RESEARCH PROJECT THAT HELPED US FULLY UNDERSTAND WHERE POOL WHERE THESE- HABITAT TYPES ARE AND HOW TO BETTER MANAGE THEM. AND SO WE SEE INCREDIBLE VALUE HERE I WOULD NOTE THAT THIS WAS- THE LOT OF DISCUSSIONS GOING ON YOUR PUBLIC SAFETY AND WE DEFINITELY SEE WHERE THIS INFORMATION COULD BENEFIT THAT. BUT IT WAS IDENTIFIED AS PART OF THE BIODIVERSITY INITIATIVE. AND SO I WOULD LIKE TO SEE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION COMING BACK FROM AS THE RESOURCES AGENCY ANSWERS QUESTIONS FOR THE LA- TO BETTER FLUSH OUT HOW. THIS WILL FURTHER BIODIVERSITY. OF PROTECTION MEASURES AND ALSO HOW THIS INFORMATION WILL BE. PUBLICLY AVAILABLE BECAUSE I DEFENDERS HAS. SERVED CENTER CA. INNOVATION AND THESE ARE BASICALLY DATA DE TORX THAT WANT THIS INFORMATION AND THEY SEE FEW POSSIBILITIES. WITH HAVING THIS INFORMATION MADE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE AND HOW IT CAN BE. ACTED LIKE. ARCHERS NOT. THAT ARE NOT RESOURCES DECISIONS SO THANK YOU. MORNING MR CHAIR MEMBERS THE CASF EXAMPLE THE NATURE. JUST WANT TO ECHO SOME THE COME TO MY PREVIOUS COLLEAGUES. REGARDING OF CERTAINLY FOR THE BUT THE BENEFITS OF COURSE BUT WE ALSO- I. WOULD BE REMISS IF WE DIDN'T MENTION THE POTENTIAL LEVERAGING OF FEDERAL FUNDS. TO MAKE THIS A BETTER PROPOSAL OVERALL THAT PARTNERSHIP POTENTIAL PARTNERSHIP EXCUSE ME WITH THE USGS WOULD BE A REALLY IMPORTANT THING IN PLEDGING US FEDERAL FUNDS. I THINK IT'S ALSO WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE QUESTIONS THAT BOTH STAFF AND LA- HAVE RAISED THE ISSUES THEY RAISE BUT WE'VE ALSO BEEN REALLY APPRECIATE OF MEETING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND WOULD BE CONSERVATION GROUPS HAVE BEEN MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY- IT TO ACTUALLY DIG INTO SOME THESE ISSUES AND QUESTIONS AND THEY ARE REALLY BEEN VERY RESPONSIVE TO THE THINGS HAVE BEEN RAISING SO JUDAS. SUPPORT THIS. THE APPROPRIATE THINKS MUCH. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME'S CULTURE MARIST'S I'M WITH THE U. S. HERE FOR SERVICE SPECIFIC SOUTHWEST REGION ON THE PROGRAM MANAGER FOR THE FOR SERVICE FOR REMOTE SENSING LAB WHERE THE NERDS THAT ACTUALLY PROCESS THE LETTER DATA- JUST REAL QUICK- THERE SOME EFFICIENCIES GAINED. AS FAR AS PLANNING FUELS MANAGEMENT FORCE HEALTH TREATMENTS ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE- WE HAVE BEEN USING LIDAR DATA WITH THE FOR SERVICE FOR ALMOST A DECADE NOW. AND EVERY YEAR IT'S BECOMING MORE MORE INTEGRAL FOR PROJECT PLANNING. IT DOES PROVIDE DATASKILL THAT'S VERY RELEVANT TO- FORESTERS AND SO CULTURE IS WILDLIFE BIOLOGISTS AND FUEL SPECIALIST AT A SCALE THAT THEY COMPLAIN PROJECTS AROUND. A FOR THE MORE THEIR EFFICIENCIES GAINED WITH FIELDER VIEWS OF THE- LAND MANAGER CAN ASSESS WITH THE LIGHT HOURS TELLING THEM AND DETERMINE WHERE TO FOCUS FIELD EFFORTS FOR. PROJECT PLANNING. FOR THE MORE THE DIGITAL ELEVATION MODEL CONSISTS WITH THE SAID ASSESSING SOIL EROSION HABIT HAS OUR GREETINGS IDENTIFIES GET ROADS. OKAY LANDINGS IN DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF WHERE TO PUT LOGGING SYSTEMS FOR FORCE HEALTH TREATMENTS- LASTLY- IT'S BEEN CRITICAL FOR IDENTIFYING FOR STRUCTURES THAT ARE ESSENTIAL FOR WILDLIFE HABITAT. AND THROUGH THE EXAMINATION A TREE SPATIAL PATTERNS CAN DETERMINE WHAT HER AREAS ARE DEVIATED FROM THE CASH FOR A VARIATION AND WHERE FOR. RESTORATION TREATMENTS CAN BE IMPLEMENTED. THANKS FOR TIME. WE THE SHORTEST ONE OF THEM ON A WITHOUT A MONEY CAL. SUPPORT OF THIS.

SO LET'S THAT WE'RE GONNA HOLD BOTH OF THOSE ITEMS OPEN LET'S MOVE BACK IN TIME TO THE VOTE ONLY CALENDAR- AND- I'VE GOT A MATRIX HERE NOW THAT I THINK WE CAN WORK WITH IT THIS IS.

COOL IT WILL I PUT THOSE ITEMS ON CALL FOR THE- ABSENT MEMBERS AND THAT TAKES US TO ALL THE WAY TO ISSUE NUMBER THREE- DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE WELCOME MR BONHAM YOU'VE BEEN VERY PATIENT THIS MORNING. SO. BUDGET VERY POORLY. READY WHEN YOU ARE MISTER BOTTOM. THANK YOU CHAIR. IT'S TRUE MY NAME IS CHUCK BOTTOM. AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE YOU'RE OWNING UP TO IT ARE YOU THIS YEAR. IT'S TAKEN A LONG TIME. I THINK ISSUE I KNOW ISSUE THREE IS AN INFORMATIONAL ITEM. AND I'M APPRECIATIVE THAT YOU WOULD CAR ABOUT. A FEW MINUTES FOR ME TO GIVE YOU A STATUS UPDATE. OF A SPECIAL PROJECT YOU ASKED US TO COMPLETE. SO HERE'S MY ONE GOAL. I WANT TO MAKE THE NEXT TENNIS MINUTES EXCITING CAPTIVATING ENERGIZING EVEN THOUGH IT'S ENTIRELY ABOUT BUSINESS ANALYTICS AS THAT'S MICHAEL YOU CAN DO THIS YES. SO YOU MIGHT ASK YOURSELF WHICH SOUNDS LIKE THE START OF A SONG WHAT IS SERVICE BASED BUDGETING. IT TURNS OUT SERVICE BASED BUDGETING IS A BUSINESS DISCIPLINE. IT IS AN ANALYTICAL APPROACH TO LOOK AT AN ENTERPRISE AND UNDERSTAND THE TASKS THE ENTERPRISE DOES THE LABOR FOCUS FOR THOSE TASKS. IT FORCES AN ORGANIZATION AROUND SERVICE AREAS IT'S ITERATIVE. AND IT ACCOMPLISHES CERTAIN BUSINESS MANAGEMENT VALUES IT PROMOTES EFFICIENCIES TRANSPARENCIES INCLUSIVITY AND IF DONE WELL IT BUILDS TRUST. SO YOU HAVE A HAND OUT WITH YOU. WHICH KIND OF TRACKS THE POINTS ARE MAKING THIS UPDATE WE WILL POST IT. ON OUR DEDICATED WEB PAGE THIS AFTERNOON FOR THE PUBLIC. SO THERE IS A MANAGEMENT CONSULTANCY ARENA AROUND SERVICE BASED BUDGETING. WE HAVE FOUR GOALS IN THIS PROJECT YOU'VE GIVEN TO US WE WANTED TO FIND THE DEPARTMENT SERVICE STANDARDS WE WANT TO PROVIDE DETAILED COST ESTIMATES AND STAFFING REQUIREMENTS ABOUT THE STANDARDS WE WANT TO COMPARE OUR CURRENT LEVEL OF SERVICE TO OUR MISSION LEVEL OF SERVICE. AND THEN WE WANT TO ANALYZE OUR REVENUES STRUCTURE AND ARE FUNDING SYSTEMS. HOW DID WE GET HERE. IT'S ACTUALLY A SEVENTY YEAR JOURNEY. I HAVE REPORT IN MY FILES FROM THE CONSULTING FIRM BOOZ ALLEN HAMILTON NINETEEN FIFTY EIGHT. THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE COMMISSIONED A REPORT TO LOOK AT OUR FINANCING AND THE REPORT CONCLUDES THE DEPARTMENT NEEDS TO SECURE SUSTAINABLE FUND. FAST FORWARD THE LEGISLATURE'S ACTUALLY AMENDED THE FISH AND GAME CODE. SECTION SEVEN TEN POINT FIVE IS A GOOD EXAMPLE YOU DECLARED IN THAT CODE SECTION THE DEPARTMENT IS UNDER FUNDED AND MUST SECURE SUSTAINABLE FUND. FAST FORWARD TO THE TWO THOUSANDS ASSEMBLY BILL REQUIRED US TO CREATE A BLUE RIBBON PANEL TO TAKE A LOOK AT OUR APARTMENT AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO BRING IT INTO THE MODERN ERA. THAT BLUE RIBBON PANEL PROCESS PRODUCED A REPORT WITH TWENTY EIGHT RECOMMENDATIONS. BUT THE HISTORY CONTINUES IN THE BUDGET ACT OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN YOU TOLD US TO GET OUR BAND BACK TOGETHER. GO BACK TO THE BLUE RIBBON PANEL GROUP. BRING IT FORWARD RECREATED YOU TOLD US TO GIVE YOU A STATUS REPORT ON THE EARLIER BLUE RIBBON RECOMMENDATIONS WE DID THAT IN OCTOBER TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. THEN YOU TOLD US TO COMPLETE MISSION BASED BUDGETING WE STARTED WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THAT ENDEAVOR. THEN WE GET TO THE BUDGET ACT OF TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN. IN THAT BUDGET ACT OUR DEPARTMENT ACTUALLY GOT A THIRTY MILLION DOLLAR THIRTY POSITION. THREE YEAR AUGMENTATION. ON ONE CONTINGENCY YOU TOLD US TO COMPLETE SERVICE BASED BUDGETING. THIS BRINGS US UP TO CURRENT TIME. IN THAT BUDGET ACT YOU GAVE US A SERIES OF MILESTONES WE'VE HIT ALL THE TARGET DATES IN STATUTE. WE HARD TO AVOID IT'S THE NATIONAL EXPERT IN THIS MANAGEMENT SPACE. ADVISORY COMMITTEE OF EIGHTY PLUS PEOPLE INVOLVING LA- STAFF SUBJECT MATTER AND BUDGET COMMITTEE STAFF FROM THE LEGISLATURE. AND A BROAD SWATH OF OUR COMMUNITY ENGAGED. WE'VE RE DIRECTED ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY OF OUR SENIOR STAFF OVER THE LAST YEAR ON THIS ANALYTICAL WORK. AND THAT BRINGS US TO SLIDE THREE IN YOUR HAND OUT. ONE OF THE THINGS WE DID FIRST. WAS RE ORIENT OURSELVES AROUND PLAIN LANGUAGE YOU'LL SEE A SLIDE THAT SAYS SERVICE AREAS. RIGHT AFTER WE ARE NOT DOING THIS ENDEAVOR BASED ON OUR BUREAUCRATIC DESCRIPTION OF OURSELVES WE WORKED WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS TO IDENTIFY EIGHT SERVICE AREAS. USING PLAYING LANGUAGE SO THAT THE DEPARTMENT CAN UNDERSTAND BETTER WHAT WE DO. FROM THE DEFINITION OF THOSE SERVICE AREAS IF YOU'LL ROLL OVER TO THE NEXT SLIDE THAT HAS A WARDEN WITH BINOCULARS. THAT DEFINITION OF EIGHT SERVICE AREAS ALLOWED US TO CREATE A ROSTER OF EVERY TASK WE DO. WE NOW HAVE A DIGITAL TEMPLATE THE TRACKS. TWO THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED PLUS TASKS. BETTER ACCOMPLISHING THOSE EIGHT SERVICE AREAS FOR EACH TASK WE ASKED OUR LEADERSHIP WHY ARE WE DOING IT BENCHMARK TO A MANDATE OR RULE OR REGULATION WE IDENTIFIED HOW MUCH TIME IS SPENT ON EACH OF THOSE TASKS AND THEN IT HAS LED US TO THE NEXT ENDEAVOR WHICH IF YOU ROLL FORWARD IN YOUR SLIDES. IS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE GAP BETWEEN OUR CURRENT ABILITIES IN SERVICE LEVEL. AND THE NEED TO ACHIEVE OUR MISSION YOU'LL SEE THAT IN THE SLIDE TO THE LEFT WHERE YOU GET A SENSE OF. THIS ANALYTICAL PROCESS ILLUSTRATING THE GAP. IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THERE ARE MANY WAYS TO RESOLVE THE GAP PROBLEM. YOU DON'T HAVE TO JUST ADD POSITIONS. FOR NECESSARILY PROGRAM FUNDING YOU CAN TAKE A LOOK AT YOUR MISSIONS YOUR POLICIES YOUR MANDATE YOU CAN TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHETHER SUMMER OUTDATED AND NEED TO BE REMOVED. YOU CAN LOOK AT YOUR OWN PROCESS SEES AND CREATE BUSINESS EFFICIENCIES. YOU CAN INCREASE YOUR PARTNERSHIPS WITH YOUR EXTERNAL. COMMUNITIES TO REDUCE COST AND BRIDGE THE GAP YOU CAN ACTUALLY INVEST IN TECHNOLOGY AND GET A RETURN ON INVESTMENT THAT MAY BE GREATER THAN THAT JUST ADDING LABOR. AND OF COURSE YOU CAN SOLVE YOUR GAP ISSUE FOCUSING ON LABOR AS WELL. SO IF YOU GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE. YOU'LL SEE THAT WHAT WE HAVE DONE IN A YEAR LAST YEAR'S WORTH OF ANALYTICAL WORK WITH THOSE EXTERNAL ADVISORS. AND THE LAWYER. IS TAKE THAT TASK REGISTRY OF THREE THOUSAND. AND TRY TO QUANTIFY IT FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER IN OUR DEPARTMENTS HISTORY. OUR GAPS ACROSS THE SERVICE AREAS THIS SLIDE REPRESENTS FROM GREATEST GAP TO LEAST A DEPICTION OF THAT RAW DATA SAID. YOU'LL SEE THE GREATEST GAPS THE CURRENT SPECIES AND HABITAT CONSERVATION. AND PERMITTING ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION. SO WHAT HAPPENS FROM THERE. WELL THE NEXT SLIDE SKETCHES OUT A FEW OF THE ONGOING EFFORTS. WE ARE SITTING ON THE BIGGEST BEST MOST VALIDATED DATA SAID WE'VE EVER HAD IN OUR DEPARTMENTS HISTORY ABOUT OUR STAFFING AND LABOR RELATED TO OUR MISSION. BUT ADDITIONAL THINGS WE WILL BE DOING IN THE UPCOMING YEAR INCLUDE. Q. A IN QC ON THAT DATA TO PERPETUALLY REFRESHES. INCLUDE BUILDING THE DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE THAT THIS IS A TOOL AVAILABLE EVERY YEAR GOING FORWARD TRAINING ALL OF OUR EMPLOYEES THAT THIS IS OUR NEW BUSINESS AS USUAL BUDGETING TOOL TO INTERFACE WITH THE LA US INTERFACE WITH FINANCED INTERFACE WITH YOU AT THE COMMITTEE LEVEL. TO DEAL WITH IN CORY'S FROM OUR STAKEHOLDERS. AND ALSO TO START UNPACKING OUR REVENUE SOURCES AND EXPENDITURES IN A PRETTY COMPLICATED BUDGET MOST WOULD SAY ONE OF THE MORE COMPLICATED BUDGET. AND STATE GOVERNMENT. BUT I WANT TO END WITH THE STORY. THAT'S MORE THAN JUST THIS BUSINESS ANALYTICS IF YOU COULD GO BACK TO THE SLIDE THAT'S THE PICTURE OF. TWO BIRDS WITH A FISH STUCK IN BETWEEN. EACH YEAR WE RUN A CONTEST WE PICK A PHOTO THE IS THE BEST PHOTO OF WILDLIFE ACTION. THIS IS THE PHOTO I PICKED FIRST EARS DIRECTOR. BECAUSE WHEN I LOOKED AT IT I THOUGHT. YOU'VE GOT TO BIRDS WENT FLYING IN AN OPPOSITE DIRECTION EACH WITH ITS TALONS IN A BIRD. STUCK IN THE MIDDLE AND I THOUGHT THAT'S LIKE LIFE IN OUR DEPARTMENT. STUCK IN THE MIDDLE. BUT THEN I THOUGHT MORE ABOUT IT LAST NIGHT WHAT WHY DO WE FIND ARE STILL STUCK IN THE MIDDLE ON MANY THINGS MY SENSE IS IT'S BECAUSE OUR MISSION IS ABOUT NATURE. AND IT'S A NATURE THAT EXIST IN A POPULATION OF FORTY MILLION PEOPLE THAT'S GOING TO FIFTY MILLION. AND THIS NATURE IS EVERYTHING IT'S B. EASE IT'S BUTTERFLIES IT'S WHALES IT'S MOUNT LINES IT'S KELP FOREST. AND WE VIEW OUR MISSIONS AS PRESERVING THIS LAND THIS WATER IN THIS WILDLIFE AS PART OF A THRIVING ECONOMY. THEY'RE INTERDEPENDENT THEY'RE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE WITH IT'S A IT'S A FUTURE IT'S A NATURE OF SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY BIRD SPECIES TWO HUNDRED TWENTY MAMMAL SPECIES. SEVENTY FRESHWATER FISH SPECIES A HUNDRED MARINE FISH AND MARINE MAMMAL SPECIES WE HAVE SIX THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED TAX- OF PLANTS IN THIS STATE TWO THOUSAND OF WHICH ARE FOUND NO WHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD. IT'S A HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE THOUSAND SQUARE MILES ALMOST FIVE THOUSAND LAKES HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MAJOR RIVERS AND STREAMS AND ELEVEN HUNDRED MILE COASTLINE AND THE GREAT OCEAN OFF OUR SHORE. THAT IS WHY PEOPLE HAVE COME HERE. THAT IS WHY PEOPLE CONTINUE TO COME HERE. IT'S OUR DESERT'S ARE FAR STAR MEADOWS ARE KELP FAR STAR WORKING AGRICULTURAL LANDS ARE RANGE LANDS. IT'S WHAT FUELS CALIFORNIA BEING THE FIFTH GREATEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD IT'S HEADING TO NUMBER ONE. THAT'S HOW WE SEE OUR MISSION AT THE DEPARTMENT. IT'S A NATURE THAT'S INCLUSIVE FOR ALL OF THAT IN ALL PEOPLE. IN THE SERVICE BASED BUDGETING EXERCISE IS A THING THAT IS HELPING US WITH THE YOU. TAKE OUR DEPARTMENT INTO A BETTER FUTURE. A MORE EFFICIENT GOVERNMENT FUTURE AND A PRESERVATION OF THAT NATURAL WEALTH. AND THAT'S KIND OF IN A NUT SHELL AT THE BROADEST LEVEL WHY THINK SERVICE BASED BUDGETING IS IMPORTANT AND AT THE NARAL LEVEL AN UPDATE ON WHAT WE'VE ACCOMPLISHED TODAY. THANK YOU- WE ARE THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY BUT WE'RE NOT HEADING FOR NUMBER ONE THAT MIGHT BE PROBLEMATIC. GOOD AS PERHAPS THE GOOD TO GOAL. I AM WONDERING IF- YOU- SINCE YOU'RE KIND OF OUR ROLE HERE- COULD TO MOVE INTO THE NEXT MOVE INTO ISSUE NUMBER FOUR AND TO. HELP US UNDERSTAND TO. AT THINK A FRANKLY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS GOING TO HAVE TO WEIGH IN HER BECAUSE I'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH OF IT AS- DO YOU KNOW WHERE. WHERE THIS ALL IS COMING FROM BUT- TO JUST T. THIS UP A LITTLE BIT. I WAS GONNA SAY WE THOUGHT WE HAD A DEAL LAST YEAR THERE ACTUALLY WAS A DEAL THAT WAS CUT ON- THE BCP FOR THE- HABITAT CONSERVATION FUND SHIFT- AND- IN THIS. YEAR'S BUDGET SOMETHING NEW HAS BEEN PROPOSED AND- SO THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION IS WHAT HAPPENED THAT DEAL. CHAIR IF I COULD START YEAH. LET ME SET THE STAGE ON THE CURRENT BUDGET PROPOSAL BUT MAKE SURE I CONNECTED TO THE LAST AGENDA ISSUE. AND THEN I'M A TURN ABOUT BECAUSE THE FINANCE FOR THE MORE DIFFICULT PARTY A QUESTION. WHAT YOU HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU. IS IT I THINK AN EXCITING SUBSTANTIVE PROPOSAL. IT TAKES THE WORK I JUST DESCRIBED. WHILE REALIZING WE HAVE A BIGGER BOLDER STILL TO COMPLETE SERVICE BASED BUDGETING DYNAMIC WE KNOW ENOUGH RIGHT NOW BASED ON OUR EXTERNAL ADVISORS AND THE DATA. TO PROPOSE SOME REALLY SMART SURGICAL INVESTMENTS THAT HAVE HIGH RETURN ON INVESTMENT FOR CALIFORNIA IT'S SO IN MY MIND THE SUBSTANCE IS SOLID. AND IT'S A PROPOSAL OF AN AUGMENTATION OF THIRTY EIGHT POINT NINE MILLION. AN ADDITIONAL FIFTY EIGHT POSITIONS AND THE CONTINUANCE OF THAT PRIOR LIMITED AUGMENTATION. WHAT I THINK YOU'RE ASKING ABOUT IS THE HOWL ONE WOULD DO THAT FINANCING INVESTMENT WHICH TRIGGERS AS YOU KNOW A COMPONENT OF LIFE FUNDS SWAP FOR A PORTION OF THIS GENERAL FUND FROM THE HABITAT CONSERVATION FUND WHICH DIRECTS MONIES TO THE WILDLIFE CONSERVATION BOARD. AND INSTEAD THAT AMOUNT OF MONEY TO OUR DEPARTMENT. MAKING THE CALCULATION WHICH I THINK IT'S CREDIBLE. YOU COULD POTENTIALLY GET GREATER RETURN ON INVESTMENT THROUGH PROGRAM INVESTMENT AT OUR DEPARTMENT. GIVEN THE WILDLIFE CONSERVATION BOARD HAS A BALANCED BUDGET. AND USES THAT EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR SMALL ISOLATED GRANTS AROUND THE STATE THAT'S THE LOGIC THAT'S THE QUESTION YOU'RE GETTING AT LET ME TURN TO MY COLLEAGUE AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO TAKE IT MORE DIRECTLY. A THIRD- I'VE NEVER DEPARTMENT FINANCE AND SO. AS THE DIRECTOR BONTA KIND OF IDENTIFY THE THROUGH STATE BUDGET DATA WITH- PRELIMINARY GAPS THAT WE FOUND WE LOOKED AT WHAT CAN WE DO TO START ADDRESSING SOME OF THOSE PRELIMINARY GAPS ACKNOWLEDGING THERE'S STILL SOMEWORK TO BE DONE ON SERVICE STATE BUDGETING HAS SO THIS PROPOSAL PROVIDES ADDITIONAL AND YOU ONE TIME GENERAL FUND INVESTMENT. WE'RE CLOSING CONTINUATION OF THE PREVIOUSLY LIMITED TERM GENERAL FUND INVESTMENT BUT WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT INTERNALLY WHERE CAN WE LOOK AT OUR EXISTING RESOURCES- AND PRIORITIZE THOSE AS WELL AS LOOKING AT THE HABITAT CONSERVATION FUND AND HAVING DISCUSSIONS WITH ALL THE CONSERVATION BOARD WE'VE IDENTIFIED FOR THOSE PURPOSES THAT THE HABITAT CONSERVATION FUND CAN BE USED. THERE'S APPROXIMATELY THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR STILL AVAILABLE FROM PREVIOUS BOND FUNDS- DIFFERENT FUND SOURCES- AND PREVIOUSLY AUTHORIZED- HABITAT CONSERVATION FUND- MONEY THAT HAVEN'T BEEN AWARDED YET THEY'RE STILL A GOOD AMOUNT OF FUNDING AVAILABLE TO THE WILDLIFE CONSERVATION FOR THESE RELATED GRANTS AND AS PART OF PROP ONE SEVEN. RECALL THAT. THE DAY BETWEEN PROP NINETY NINE REVENUE AND THIRTY MILLION BE- PROVIDED BY THE GENERAL FUND AS A PART OF AYE I DON'T I DON'T THINK YOU'RE GETTING THE- A TO THE HEART OF MY QUESTION LAST YEAR DURING THE BUDGET PROCESS THERE WAS A VERY CAREFULLY- NEGOTIATED COMPROMISE THAT EXTENDED THE SUNSET DATE FOR THE WILDLIFE CONSERVATION FUND RIGHT. I EXCUSE ME THAT HABITAT CONSERVATION FUND. HI AND THAT IS BEING UNDONE IN THE CURRENT BUDGET PROPOSAL. SO WHAT I ATE MY FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION IS. IF THERE'S A DEAL THAT'S CUT. DOES DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE FEEL LIKE A IT CAN JUST ARBITRARILY BE- UNDONE BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAY IT FEELS TO ME AND I THINK TO- BUDGET STAFF- WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO. NEGOTIATE IN GOOD FAITH WITH ONE ANOTHER THERE MAY BE VERY VALID REASONS FOR ON DOING THIS BUT IT'S A DEAL AND IF IT'S GONNA BE UNDONE IT OUGHT TO BE ON DONE BY BOTH SIDES OF THE DEAL SO IF YOU COULD RESPOND TO THAT SPECIFIC ISSUE I'D APPRECIATE IT. YES I THINK THE ONE THING ON THE IN TERMS THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE AT BEING PROPOSED HERE AS THOUGH WE ARE ARE NOT BUILDING TO SUNSET THE HABITAT CONSERVATION FUND THE HABITAT CONSERVATION FUND GETS REVENUES FROM BOTH PROP NINETY NINE AND THE GENERAL FUND. THE HABITAT CONSERVATION OF WILL CONTINUE RECEIVING REVENUE FROM PROP NINETY NINE SO THAT'S GOING TO CONTINUE TO GO INTO THAT POND- IS JUST THE PORTION THAT'S BEING SON CITED IF THE GENERAL FUND PORTION AND AGAIN- YOU KNOW THIS IS OUR PROPOSAL BUT- ONLY A PARTIAL ABROGATION OF THE DEAL. CHAIR IS THAT ACCURATE. WHAT I WOULD SAVE WE'RE PROPOSING IS STILL WE WILL CONSIDER WITHIN THE SPIRITS OF- WHAT THE USES ARE IN TERMS OF SUPPORTING THE PARTITION WALL LIFE FOR THEIR- EFFORTS- WITH EFFICIENCY IN PERMITTING FOR RESTORATION PROJECT. ACKNOWLEDGING THERE IS STILL SIGNIFICANT OF FUNDING AVAILABLE FOR THOSE PURPOSES AVAILABLE FOR THE CAUGHT HABITAT ONSERVATION FUND WITHIN THE WALL AYE CONSERVATION BOARD. WHICH CHAPLAIN MATH MANNER JECT OF COURSE. I VERY MUCH NOTE YOUR QUESTION AND UNDERSTAND IT. I FULLY EXPECT PUBLIC SPEAKERS WILL ALSO EXPECT. SUPPRESSED FRUSTRATION I KNOW THIS I. ALSO REALIZE THE RECOMMENDATION IS TO HOLD THE ITEM OPEN. WE HAVE DAYS AND WEEKS AHEAD OF US AND I LOOK FORWARD TO ENGAGING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION AND YOU AND THE RELEVANT BUDGET COMMITTEES ON THIS GOING FORWARD. A YEAR A CHARMER MISTER BONNER. I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE CONTINUING CONVERSATIONS ON- ON THIS ITEM I THINK IT'S- I DID THAT THE ISSUE THAT I'M IDENTIFYING I THINK IS AN IMPORTANT ONE BECAUSE IT AFFECTS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE BRANCHES- LET'S HEAR FROM THE LA- ON THIS. AND THE- IF THERE'S NO QUESTIONS FROM THE DIS WILL THEN MOVE TO PUBLIC COMMENT THANK YOU. THANK YOU RACHEL EHLERS WITH THAT ALEJO OUT SO THAT THE PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU HAS THREE COMPONENTS THE ONE WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IS THE ONGOING NEW ONGOING FUNDING ON NINETEEN MILLION THAT WOULD BE SHIFTED IN GENERAL FUND- I THINK OUR ADVICE TO HEAR IS THAT IT REALLY IS A WEIGHING OF TRADE OFFS OF WHAT ARE YOUR GENERAL FUND PRIORITIES AND WHAT ARE YOUR CONSERVATION PRIORITIES OBVIOUSLY ADOPTING THE- AND GOT THERE THERE'S CLEARLY IN NEED. AT THE AD DEPARTMENT FISH AND WILDLIFE WE THINK THOSE THE INITIAL RESULTS OF THE SERVICE BASE BUDGET HAVE REVIEW HAVE HIGHLIGHTED THAT SO DO YOU VIEW THERE BEING A GREATER NEED AT FISH WILDLIFE VERSES WILDLIFE CONSERVATION BOARD DO YOU BELIEVE THERE NEEDS AT BOTH AND THEREFORE WHEN APPROPRIATE ADDITIONAL GENERAL FUND. DO YOU WANT TO WAIT ANOTHER YEAR UNTIL WE HAVE MORE RESULTS YOU KNOW IT'S REALLY WE DON'T HAVE AN EASY ANSWER FOR YOU ON THIS ONE IT'S REALLY WAITING THAT TADE OFFS FOR THE OTHER TWO COMPONENTS- FOR THE ONE TIME TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND BASIC BASICALLY FOR EQUIPMENT PURPOSES THAT PURCHASES. WE THINK THAT IS JUSTIFIED BY THE DEPARTMENT AND- WOULD RECOMMEND APPROVING THAT PIECE AND THEN THE FINAL PIECE THERE. ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING APPROVING NOW TWENTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS FOR BUDGET YOUR PLUS ONE FOR THE FUNDING SHORTFALL THAT WILL EMERGE THERE AFTER THE THREE YEARS A FUNDING EXPIRES WE THINK IT'S PREMATURE TO APPROVE THAT NOW WE WOULD RECOMMEND TO FOR THAT DECISION. UNTIL NEXT YEAR WHEN YOU HAVE THE FULL RESULTS OF THE SERVICE BASE BUDGET REVIEW AND CAN UNDERSTAND ALL OF THE DIFFERENT REVENUE THE DEPARTMENT HAS AVAILABLE. BERMAN FINANCE CITY. CONTENT YOU TEAR BLOOM AMBER MORNING SUBCOMMITTEE MEMBERS ARE MILLION WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- I'D LIKE TO SAY THE ADMINISTRATION REMAINS COMMITTED TO ADVANCING THE DEPARTMENT'S ABILITY TO MEET ITS MISSION. THE THREE YEAR APPROPRIATION THAT STARTED IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN SUPPORTS A- THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS HAVING THE LARGEST- SERVICE GAPS. IN THE PRELIMINARY DATA FOR THE SERVICE BASED BUDGETING. AND SO IT IS TRUE THAT THE FUNDING IT DOES NOT EXPIRE UNTIL NEXT YEAR. BUT AUTHORIZING PERMANENT FUNDING IN THIS PRESENTS BUDGET- WILL ALLOW FOR A CONTINUOUSLY COMPREHENSIVE MULTI YEAR ACCOUNTS. OF PROJECTED GENERAL FUND SPENDING. AND FURTHERMORE THE ADMINISTRATION BELIEVES- IT IS APPROPRIATE TO PROVIDE THE DEPARTMENT WITH CERTAINTY. WITH PLANNING AND THE RETENTION OF STAFF FOR IT THAT IT WHOM- IT HAS HIRED- TO PERFORM THE ADD ACTIVITIES. FUNDED BY THIS APPROPRIATION. THANK YOU. ALL VERY LAUDABLE GOALS MR BONTA I'D LIKE A CHANCE TO JUST SELL IT A LITTLE BIT MORE. WITH SOME SPECIFIC EXAMPLES. THE THIRTY EIGHT MILLION I THINK AND I HAVE TO MAKE IT QUICK THAT'S AS WE ARE UNDERSTOOD THE THIRTY EIGHT MILLION U. SPLIT INTO YOU CAN SPLIT INTO. TWO ASPECTS THERE'S TWENTY MILLION ONE TIME. WE WANT TO MODERNIZE OUR HATCHERIES BY EIGHTEEN EXHORTING FACILITY MACHINES FORTY THREE NEW TRUCKS THAT'LL MAKE SURE WE CAN GET FISH MORE SAFELY WITH LOWER LABOR COST OUT FOR ANGLERS. WE WANT TO MODERNIZE OUR WATER CONVEYANCE SYSTEM AND SWITCH ALL DIESEL PUMPS TO SOLAR ARRAYS. AND THAT WILL REDUCE OUR OWN EMISSIONS AND AUTOMATE OUR WATER DELIVERY TO KEEP WETLANDS WEDDED FOR WILDLIFE AND FOR DUCK HUNTERS. WE WANT TO BUY ONE NEW PLANE WE HAVE SEVEN PLANES SIX OF THEM DATE THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES. HAVING A PLANE AVAILABLE WITH MODERN CONFIGURATION WILL ALLOW US TO MONITOR THE OCEAN KEEP OUR EYES ON WHALES AS THEY'RE MIGRATING AND HELP AVOID COMMERCIAL FISHING GEAR. THAT'S TWENTY MILLION ONE TIME THE LA- RECOMMENDS I THINK THAT IT'S A WISE INVESTMENT. THEN YOU GET TODAY EIGHTEEN POINT SIX THAT HAS THE CONTROVERSY AROUND THE FUNDS WORSE. THAT WOULD GO INTO THREE PROGRAM AREAS. YOU HEARD SECRETARY CROWFOOT ABOUT HIS BIO DIVERSITY INTEREST WE WOULD PUT SEVEN PEOPLE AND ONE POINT TWO NINE NINE MILLION ENDED UP BY A DIVERSITY WE OWN A MILLION ACRES. WE ARE NOT DOING WELL ENOUGH MAKING THOSE LANDS AVAILABLE TO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND INTRODUCING OURSELVES TO ALL OF CALIFORNIA WE WANT TO DO THAT WE WANTED TO CLIMATE ASSESSMENTS ACROSS ALL OUR LANDS. WE OWN LANDS ALONG THE COASTAL STRIP THAT IF WE RESTORE THEM IN PARTNERSHIP WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT WE CAN CREATE AT SEA LEVEL RISE BUFFER USING OUR LANDS. THE NEXT CATEGORY CUT GREEN TAPE. WE NEED TO DO MORE RESTORATION PROJECTS FASTER SOONER AT GREATER SCALE AND OFTEN WE INHIBIT THE DOING OF THEM WITH OUR OWN PERMITTING REQUIREMENTS WE'RE GOING TO CREATE A TEAM OF FIFTEEN PEOPLE. LAWYER GRANT MAKER ACCOUNTING CONTRACTING PLANNER WE'RE GONNA PUT HIM IN THE NORTHERN PART OF CALIFORNIA FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO THE OREGON BORDER WITH TIMBER WITH CINEMA COUNTY WATER AGENCY AND WITH TRIBES AND CONSERVATION GROUPS WE ARE GOING TO ACCELERATE THE PACE OF RESTORATION TO BRING SAM BACK. LAST ISSUE. I SEE THE PROGRAM. WE PUT THIRTY ONE PEOPLE UNHEARD OF. IMPROVEMENT FIRE DEPARTMENT AND TEN MILLION DOLLARS INTO OUR SEATS PROGRAM THE CALIFORNIA ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT. WE HAVE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY ANIMALS AND PLANTS THAT ARE PROTECTED UNDER STATE LAW THAT GENERATES ABOUT TWO HUNDRED PERMITS A YEAR WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH JUST IN THE LAST EIGHTEEN MONTHS WE'VE GOT ANOTHER DOZEN PETITIONS TO LIST SPECIES. AND WE HAVEN'T EVEN STARTED TO DO. HOW DO YOU GET HIM OFF THE LIST AND HOW DO YOU DO RECOVERY. THESE FIFTEEN PEOPLE WON'T LET US DO THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY CAREER AT THE DEPARTMENT. SO WITH THAT I APPRECIATE THE EXTRA MINUTES. THANK YOU FOR THAT ADDITIONAL AMOUNT OF DETAIL QUESTION. RIGHT LET'S SOME WITH PUBLIC COMMENT. IT WAS MORNING OR AFTERNOON AT THIS POINT- CAN DELFINO REPRESENTING DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE I'M I'M JUST GONNA START WITH WHAT WE'RE SUPPORTING RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THAT'S QUICK- WE ARE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE ONE TIME FUNDING THAT. THAT IT'S BEEN PROPOSED HERE WE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THE EXTENSION OF THE THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT IS A CONTINUATION OF SORT OF THE DEAL THAT CAME TOGETHER THAT LAUNCHED INTO THE SERVICE BASED BUDGETING EFFORT. HOWEVER AS IT'S ALREADY BEEN DISCUSSED OUR BIG CONCERN RIGHT NOW IS- THE DELETION OF THE- SUNSET DATE I AND ESSENTIALLY THE ELIMINATION OF THE HABITAT CONSERVATION COUNTRY TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE AND ALSO THE FUN SHIFT OF HABITAT CONSERVATION FUND MONEY. TO OF EIGHTEEN POINT NINE MILLION TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE TO FIND WHAT ARE EXTREMELY LAUDABLE PROGRAM SO LET ME JUST START FIRST OF ALL WE DO NOT HAVE A PROBLEM WITH WHAT THEY'RE PROPOSING TO FIND WITH THE EIGHTEEN POINT NINE MILLION AS SOMEONE WHO WORKED ON ENDANGERED SPECIES ISSUES. FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS THE DEPARTMENT IS LONG OVERDUE IN GETTING THE STAFFING- FOR THE ENDANGERED SPECIES PROGRAM THEY HAVE A FULL TIME AT THE DEPARTMENT RIGHT NOW JUST THE FULL TIME PEOPLE ONLY DOING DANGER SPECIES MY UNDERSTANDING FIVE PEOPLE FOR THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THAT'S RIDICULOUS SO WE THINK THAT THERE'S DEFINITELY AND OF A STRONG CASE TO BE MADE FOR WHAT THEY'RE PROPOSING TO FIND THE PROBLEM IS FUND SOURCE BECAUSE AS YOU WELL NOTED LAST YEAR A DEAL CAME TOGETHER TO EXTEND THE HABITAT CONSERVATION FUND FOR TEN MORE YEARS. TO WRITE THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF GUARANTEED FUNDING FOR CONSERVATION IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT IS MONEY THAT GOES TO STATE PARKS THAT'S MONEY THAT GOES TO OCEAN THE COASTAL CONSERVANCY TAHOE CONSERVANCY LOCAL PARK DISTRICT GRANTS AND A CHUNK OF MONEY THE EIGHTEEN POINT NINE TO THE WILDLIFE CONSERVATION BOARD. WHO USES THAT MONEY AND SOMEONE'S WELL SMALL GRANTS AROUND THE STATE WELL THOSE ARE MONIES THAT ARE SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIED FOR MOUNTAIN LION HABITAT CONSERVE. FOR INLAND WETLANDS- ACQUISITION CONSISTENT WITH STATES OBLIGATION. PART AS PART. FOR A LOT FAT WHAT'S YOUR VISION AND- VALLEY PRO IMPROVEMENT ACT FOR RIGHT CARRYING HABITAT. WE DIDN'T GO DOWN THIS PATH OF WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE TO GET INCREASED FUNDING. IF IT'S GOING TO TURN OUT THAT THEY WOULD ESSENTIALLY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WOULD ESSENTIALLY RAID ANOTHER FUN SOURCE. AND SHIFT THAT MONEY OVER THAT'S YOU KNOW ROBBING PETER TO PAY PAUL. SO WE WILL- WE BELIEVE THAT THE DEAL WAS A DEAL LAST YEAR THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE SHOULD BE REJECTED. BECAUSE IT WOULD ESSENTIALLY GOT OUT THE FULL THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR THAT WE BELIEVED WAS GOING TO BE GOING TO THE W. C. B. AND THEN IT SAYS. THE DIP IN THE BEEN IT DOES NOT PROVIDE GUARANTEED FUNDING BECAUSE ONCE THE HABITAT CONSERVATION FUND IS ELIMINATED. AND GOES AWAY. THAT BECOMES NOW GENERAL FUND MONEY SO WHATEVER ADDITIONAL AUGMENTATION TO GO TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. THAT'S GENERAL FUND MONEY AND AS WE ALL KNOW THAT MONEY DISAPPEARS. ANY TIME THERE'S AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN THAT IS NOT CERTAIN FUNDING AT ALL FOR THE DEPARTMENT. SO WE BELIEVE THAT THE PROPOSAL REALLY VIOLATES THE SPIRIT OF THIS SERVICE BASED BUDGETING EXERCISE THAT WE'VE GONE A LONG. AND IS REALLY DISAPPOINTING TO US THAT THIS IS HOW THE ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO PROPOSE. ACTUALLY PROTECTING% ITS BIODIVERSITY FOR THAT REASON WE WOULD URGE THAT YOU HOLD OPEN. THE W. STUDY- BC P. FOR THE DEPARTMENT AT THIS POINT UNTIL WE CAN WORK THROUGH THE FUND SOURCE. OF FOR THAT EIGHTEEN POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS OF REALLY IMPORTANT PROGRAM THANK YOU. MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS JENNIFER FEARING HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE MOUNTAIN LION FOUNDATION- I WANT TO START BY JUST PUBLICLY THANKING DIRECTOR BERMAN AND HIS TEAM FOR THEIR SWIFT AND PROTECTIVE RESPONSES OVER THE PAST FEW WEEKS- TO HELP. US PUT THE STATE ON A PATH TO DECREASING MOUNTAIN LION MORTALITY AND TO ADVANCING NEW LEGAL PROTECTIONS FOR MOUNTAIN LIONS- AT NOT LAND ON NATION WAS THE ORIGINAL PROPONENTS. OF PROP ONE SEVENTEEN PASSED BY VOTERS IN NINETEEN NINETY THAT CREATED THE HABITAT CONSERVATION FUND AND THE THIRTY YEARS OF THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS OF YOUR FUNDING THAT. WAS SET ACCORDING TO THE PROPOSITION TO EXPIRE THIS YEAR THAT LAST YEAR AS WE'VE ALL DISCUSSED WAS AGREED TO BY THE LEGISLATURE IN ADMINISTRATION TO BE EXTENDED FOR ANOTHER TEN YEARS. WE AGREE THAT THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE SHOULD BE- REJECTED FOR THE REASONS THAT CAN MADE BUT ALSO FROM A LEGAL PERSPECTIVE THAT LANGUAGE OF THE PROPOSITION REQUIRES THAT AMENDMENTS. FURTHER THE PURPOSE AND INTENT. OF THE INITIATIVE WHICH TAKING THIS MONEY AWAY- A IT DOES NOT DO. SECONDLY IT ONLY AUTHORIZES AN EXTENSION WHICH HAPPENED LAST YEAR OR REPEAL. OF THE SUNSET NOW THAT THE LANGUAGE IS WHAT IS TODAY THANKS TO THE CHANGES LAST YEAR IT'S SIMPLY NOT AUTHORIZED- IT TO MAKE A CHANGE THAT ELIMINATE. THAT FAMILY PERSPECTIVE. AND FINALLY IT SEEMS CLEAR THAT IN A BEST CASE SCENARIO WITH THE- PREVIOUS THINGS I SAID WORK PROBLEMATIC YOU THIS WOULD TRIGGER A FOUR FIFTHS VOTE- THRESHOLD WHICH IS REQUIRED BY. THE INITIATIVE SO WE- HAVE A SERIOUS SERIOUS LEGAL CONCERNS ABOUT WHAT'S BEEN PROPOSED TRAILER BILL- WITH REGARD TO THE B. C. P. AS A LONG TIME- ADVOCATE I WAS INVOLVED WITH THE AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTY SIX- STAKEHOLDER- PROCESS INVESTED HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF. HOURS PART OF THAT PROCESS THE DECADE AND IT. HIT FOR TO. WITHIN THE SERVICE BUDGET EFFORT WE CERTAINLY HEART. BY THE DEPARTMENTS EMBRACE OF THAT PROCEDURE AND SO FAR THE RESULTS HAVE YIELDED- EVIDENCE THAT'S SEE VERY CONSISTENT WITH OUR OWN EXPERIENCE THAT HAS BEEN RE IMPOSSIBLE TO SUBSTANTIAL A CREDIBLE EIGHT. MAKE OF A CASE HERE IN THE LETTER. FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING SO. WE CONSIDER IT AN OVER ARCHING PRIORITY THAT HE SERVICE BASE BUDGET LEAD TO NOTHING SHORT OF A TRANSFORMATION. IN THE WAY THAT WE COMMIT TO SUSTAINABLE FUNDING FOR FISH AND WILDLIFE PRIORITIES. AND WHILE THE BCP INCLUDE SEVERAL IMPORTANT PROPOSE INVESTMENTS NOTABLY FOR THE CEASE A REVIEW IN RECOVERY PROGRAMS WHICH IS A TRACK MOUNTAIN LIONS ARE VERY MUCH ON AT THIS MOMENT. WE KNOW THIS IS JUST THE START- WE NEED AN INCREASE IN INVESTMENT IN TRANSPORTATION PLANNING TO RECONNECT HABITATS AND DECREASE VEHICLE COLLISIONS WE NEED TO EXPAND WILDLIFE LAW ENFORCEMENT CAPACITY. AN INCREASE CO EXISTENCE STRATEGIES AND PROGRAM SO WE'RE DEEPLY HOPEFUL THAT WE ARE ON THE PRECIPICE OF REAL TRANSFORMATION AT A CRITICAL MOMENT IN THE DEPARTMENT'S HISTORY. AND SO THAT THE IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT THE LEGISLATURE THE ADMINISTRATION AND STAKEHOLDERS ARE ALL ALLIES IN DEVELOPING THAT VISION THANK YOU. MORNING IN HIS CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M FURTHER ALONG ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA NATIVE PLANT SOCIETY AS WELL AS CALIFORNIA TROUT. AND TRAVEL LIMITED. I WOULD LIKE TO JUST THE LINE COMMENTS MADE BY- MISTER FINO BEHALF DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE I AM VERY MUCH. CONCERNED ABOUT THE- THE REVERSION ON THE EXTENSION OF THE H. C. F. LOOK FROM LAST YEAR- IN PARTICULAR WANT TO POINT OUT THAT- YOU KNOW AS AS MENTIONED STATE BECAUSE THE CONSERVANCY GETS- FOUR MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY FROM THAT FUND AS WELL AS STATE PARKS GETS FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY FROM THAT FUND. WHICH UNDOING OF THE EXTENSION WOULD ABSOLUTELY MAKE IT EASY FOR THAT MONEY TO GO. INTO OTHER PURPOSES IN THE GENERAL FUND- THE REAL THE GREAT CONCERN THERE IS THAT THE H. C. F. DOLLARS DON'T HAVE THE SAME LIMITATIONS THAT BOND DOLLARS DO. I GUESS ABSOLUTELY W. CITY DOES HAVE A LOT OF BOND. MONIES AVAILABLE TO THEM BUT AS WE ALL KNOW IN THIS COMMITTEE IN DISCUSSIONS WE HAD LAST YEAR. THAT'S VERY LIMITED YOU CAN'T DO A LOT OF THE PROGRAM BEING AN ADDITIONAL ACTIVITIES THAT WE WANT TO SEE AND CONTINUE TO SEE. AN A PARTICULAR AS IT RELATES TO THE STATE PARKS FUNDING- ABSOLUTELY WE ARE THERE WE WANT TO BE AS SUPPORTIVE AS WE CAN BE. FOR ALL THE THINGS THAT ARE PROPOSED TO BE FOR AND IN THE- BUDGET PROPOSAL. ON INCLUDING THE TWENTY MILLION ONE TIME. THE ONGOING GENERAL FUND AND IN THIS CASE THE TRAVERSE BIT YOU KNOW WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO SUPPORT GENERAL FUND GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND- I THINK WE CAN GET CREATIVE ON ON TRYING TO IDENTIFY ADDITIONAL FUNDING- THAT BECAUSE WE ALSO. AGREE THAT EVERYTHING THAT WAS LISTED IN THERE IS ARE THINGS THAT THE DEPARTMENT SHOULD BE DOING AND CONTINUE TO DO AND AUGMENT AUGMENTING THEIR STAFF IS GONNA BE CRITICAL TO FOR THEM TO ACHIEVE THOSE OBJECTIVES- SO FOR ALL THOSE REASONS- WE OPPOSE. THE X. THE EXTINGUISHMENT OF THE OF THE EXPANSION OF HDF- BUT ABSOLUTELY SUPPORT ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR ALL THE TINGS THAT ARE OUTLINED IN THE BUDGET PROPOSAL THANK YOU. WELL LET ME DOWN A WITHOUT A CAL. WILL BUT WE WILL LIKE TO ALIGN OURSELVES- WITH THE COMMENTS OF THE PREVIOUS THREE SPEAKERS- WE WANT TO SEE A RESILIENT DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE YOU WANNA SEE RESILIENCY. AND WILDLIFE THAT WE HAVE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. BUT WE CANNOT BE DOING THAT AT THE EXPENSE OF. ACTUALLY PUTTING PROJECTS ON THE GROUND THAT CREATE HABITAT. THAT CREATE OPEN SPACE- IN PARKS IN AND AREAS THAT WE THINK. WE NEED AROUND THE STATE. THE DIRECTOR SAID SO HIMSELF HE WANTS TO SEE A DEPARTMENT THAT. IS FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. UNFORTUNATELY WHAT WE SEEN OUR LEADS FROM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS THAT. IT'S EASIER TO SUPPLY A LOT OF THE MONEY THAT. WOULD JOB BE FUNDING- NATURAL RESOURCES IN EXCHANGE FOR MONTHS RIGHT AND WE LIKE ONES WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE BONDS BUT THAT'S DREADED TRADITIONALLY HOW WE'VE BEEN PAYING FOR NATURAL RESOURCES I THINK THAT WE NEED TO TAKE A HARD LOOK AT US TO WE NEED TO CHANGE THAT MINDSET ESPECIALLY WITHIN DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. IS HOW THEY- WHEN THEY CHOOSE TO. THINK OF NATURAL RESOURCES THEY THEY WANT TO PLAY. NATURAL RESOURCES WITH A CREDIT CARD IN A VERY EXPENSIVE MONEY AND WE THINK THAT WE SHOULD BE DOING AND THINKING IT ABOUT THIS SO MUCH DIFFERENTLY THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING AGAIN JAMIE GO ON BEHALF OF LATINO OUTDOORS WE WANNA ECHO MANY OF THE COMMENTS THAT WE WERE JUST PREVIOUSLY MADE AND WE SHARE MANY OF THE SAME FRUSTRATIONS WITH THE FUN SHIP FROM H. C. F. BUT THAT BEING SAID WE DO WANT TO EXPRESS THAT- THE YEAR. FUNDING FOR EDUCATION AND OUTREACH THAT IS PROPOSED IS SOMETHING THAT WE THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY AS IT RELATES TO REACHING OUT TO DIVERSE THAT'S A COMMUNITY.

THE MORNING PAUL MASONS THAT FOREST TRUST ALL DISASSOCIATE MYSELF ALL THE PRIOR COMMENTS WHICH REALLY OF SAID MUCH WITH THE NEEDS TO BE SAID. AND SIMPLY ADD THAT THE IDEA THAT WE WOULD FIND. THE ABILITY OF THE DEPARTMENT TO MEET SOME OF THEIR CORE STATUTORY AND PUBLIC TRUST RESPONSIBILITIES. BY CUTTING ONE OF THE FEW STABLE SOURCES OF CONSERVATION FUNDING IS JUST. UNACCEPTABLE THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS THAT RAN WITH THEIR AND READING ASSOCIATES REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF PROFESSIONAL SCIENTIST WE SUPPORT THE PROPOSAL IN AS MUCH AS A PROVIDES FIFTY EIGHT NEW POSITIONS FORTY ONE OF WHICH OUR STATE SCIENTIFIC POSITIONS POSITIONS ARE SORELY NEED FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO WHAT TO DO THEIR JOB AND WE CERTAINLY HOPE THAT WHEN YOU REACH AN UNDERSTANDING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION IN THE LEAD THAT YOU INCLUDE THOSE FIFTY EIGHT POSITIONS- IN WHATEVER AGREEMENT YOU REACH.

I WANT TO START- BY PRESENTING IT USED FIVE AND SIX TOGETHER IF I COULD THEY DO HAVE SOME SIMILARITIES IN THAT THEY ARE BOTH CROSS BORDER WATER TREATMENT. OF PROJECTS AND OTHER QUESTIONS ON BOTH OF THEM ABOUT ON GOING OPERATIONAL COSTS. THE NEW RIVER IMPROVEMENT PROJECT REQUESTS TWENTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS- TEN MILLION FROM THE GENERAL FUND- AND- TWENTY EIGHT MILLION FROM PROP SIXTY EIGHT TO DIVERT TREAT AND RE WATER A NATURAL RIVER COURSE. THE CITY OF CALEXICO HAS COMMITTED TO PROVIDING ONGOING OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE FUNDING FOR THE FACILITIES UP KEEP. THE TIJUANA RIVER PROJECT IS SIMILARLY A PROJECT TO CAPTURE POLLUTION. THROUGH A SERIES OF SEDIMENTATION AND DETENTION BASINS TO REDUCE THE VOLUME OF CONTAMINATED WATER TRASH AND SETTLEMENT INTO THE TIJUANA RIVER VALLEY ESTUARY. THE BUDGET REQUEST THIRTY FIVE MILLION IN GENERAL FUND FOR THIS SERIES OF PROJECTS. THE LA- HAS RAISED THE CONCERN OVER ONGOING OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE COSTS OF THESE FACILITIES AND I HAVE WITH ME TODAY ERIC JARVIS FROM THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY WHO IS HERE TO SPEAK TO THOSE ISSUES- IN PARTICULAR SO ERIC I'LL- TURN IT OVER TO YOU. THANK YOU DIRECTOR NAME IT'S GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR SO MY MEMBER RIVAS FOR THE RECORD JARVIS KELLY PA- HAVE.

ARE POLLUTED WATER BODY SO THIS BEGAN AS A WATER QUALITY ISSUE- WHICH IS YOU KNOW IS IN THE PURVIEW OF THE STATE MUTUAL% WATER BOARDS AND SO I JUST. WANTED TO RECOGNIZE IS A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT BETWEEN THE NATURAL RESOURCES WATER RESOURCES AGENCY AND CAL EPA- BUT BECAUSE THE SOLUTIONS PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR INVOLVED WATER INFRASTRUCTURE% CONSTRUCTION. HE W. R. AS THE IS IT THE EXPERT IN THAT AREA AND SO WE'LL BE WATCHING CLOSELY- HAS THESE PROJECTS MOVE FORWARD. UP ALL ALL SHE TO DIRECTOR HIM TOUCHED ON SEVERAL HOURS BUT WHAT I WILL SAY IS WHEN THE GOVERNOR AND BUILDING JANUARY TEN BUDGET- HE HIGHLIGHTED MANY AREAS THAT NEED OUR ATTENTION SPECIFICALLY RECOGNIZING THE SCALE AND% IMMEDIACY. OF OUR CLIMATE PROBLEM AND THE NEED TO DRAMATICALLY INCREASE AND LEVERAGE INVESTMENTS- THE NEW. ANTI WANT TO REVERSE THE NOTABLY BUT WE NEED TO BE- WE NEED TO BE COMMITTED TO THIS EFFORT AND SO- THE GOVERNOR'S COMMITTED TO TACKLING LONG STANDING CHALLENGES WON OR SHARED BORDER WITH MEXICO. HE'S ALSO COMMITTED TO FOSTERING NEW OPPORTUNITIES TO BUILD BI NATIONAL PARTNERSHIPS WITH OUR COLLEAGUES ACROSS MEXICO IN BAJA CALIFORNIA AND BAJA SIR- YOU MAY RECALL LAST DECEMBER THE GOVERNOR SIGNED THE COMMISSION OF CALIFORNIA'S MO MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING. THIS SYMBOL YOU FURTHER ENABLES US TO PARTNER WITH OUR COLLEAGUES AT THE FEDERAL STATE AND MUNICIPAL LEVELS IN MEXICO JUST STREAM ON OUR ABILITY TO ADDRESS SURE CHALLENGES INTO A BRACE OPPORTUNITIES FOR COLLABORATION. POLLUTION CHALLENGES OF THE NEW IN TIJUANA RIVERS IN ADDITION TO AIR QUALITY MOBILITY TRANSPORTATION OVERALL FORSMAN CHALLENGES ARE HIGH PRAIRIE HI. ALREADY AREAS THIS COLLABORATION AND ARE AT THE VERY HEART OF THE PRINCIPLES. WITHIN THEM YOU. I'M AS AS THE I WILL THAT WON'T AND CONTINUE ON DESCRIBE THE- TO PROVOKE UNLESS YOU HOUSES INSTRUCTOR NAY ATTACHED IT. BUT QUICKLY I JUST ONE TO HIGHLIGHT. IMPLEMENTING THE NEW RIVER AND TWO ONE RIVER- PROJECTS- OR- CRITICAL IN OUR KEY STEP TO SUPPORTING A GREENER AND CLEANER RIVER THROUGHOUT IMPERIAL COUNTY PARTICULARLY ON-THE RIVER AS IT FLOWS TOWARDS THE SALTON SEA.

WE GOT ABOUT THE TEARS UP OVER THEM- AND WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY SPECIFIC QUESTION. HELLO THANK YOU ARE WE DON'T QUESTION THE MERITS OF THESE PROJECTS THERE'S VERY SEVERE POLLUTION ISSUES AND- SOMEBODY NEEDS TO DEAL WITH THEM AND SO WE THINK AYE THE STATE THAT NEEDS TO PLAY A ROLE IN THE PARTNERSHIPS TO ADDRESS THEM I THINK THE ONE CONCERN WE DO RACES AROUND THE TIJUANA RIVER PROJECT- CONSTRUCTING THESE PROJECTS WOULD. HAVE INVOLVE ONGOING OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE WHENEVER WE CONTRACT PROJECTS AND PRETTY SIGNIFICANT LEVEL SIX POINT FIVE MILLION ANNUALLY SO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL INCLUDES FUNDING TO COVER THOSE COSTS FOR THE FIRST TWO YEARS BUT DOESN'T ADDRESS HOW THEY WOULD BE COVERED IN THE OUT YEARS SO WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR YOU ALL AS YOU'RE CONSIDERING MAKING THIS INVESTMENT AND- BUILDING THESE PROJECTS HOW WILL THEY BE MAINTAINED IN THE FUTURE WILL IT BE UP TO THE STATE.

THE NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION THAT COSPONSORED ASSEMBLY BILL TEN SEVENTY NINE. SOME BUILT IN SEVENTY NINE IS- PRETTY MUCH THE REASON WE'RE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION TODAY- AS A RESULT THE TECHNICAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE WAS COMPRISED IN WHICH WE BROUGHT THE COMMUNITY. AND THE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES FROM THE THREE LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT TO THE TABLE- AS YOU KNOW AND IF YOU'VE READ IN YOUR MATERIAL- THIS PLAN SPEARHEADED RESOURCES TO BE DESIGNATED FOR THE PROJECTS NOT ONLY ONE PROJECT. BUT ALL THE PROJECTS IDENTIFIED IN THE FIVE FACES OF THE PLAN A PLAN THAT WAS ADOPTED BY THE CALIFORNIA MEXICO BORDER RELATIONS COUNSELING TWENTY TWELVE- AS A RESULT OF THIS.

COMPARED TO THE TO WANNA RIVER- ISSUE. WE ARE IN THE SOUTHEASTERN CORNER AND IMPERIAL COUNTY BOARDING WITH MEXICO- SINCE NINETEEN FORTY FIVE THIS HAS BEEN CONSIDERED A PUBLIC HEALTH THREAT- THAN YOU RIVER RUNS IN FROM MEXICO CALLIE BACK CALIFORNIA. INTO CALEXICO WORKING ITS WAY TO THE SONG SEE THE PROBLEM HERE THAT WE HAVE IS THAT- GROUND ZERO IS CALEXICO AS THE MAJORITY OF THE CONTAMINANTS COMING IN THROUGH THE WTER WAY FOR THROUGH OUR CITY.

TO BODIES OF WATER THAT THAT WE KNOW ARE EXTREMELY POLLUTED. AND EXTREMELY- AND ACCESSIBLE OR SHOULD BE AN ACCESSIBLE FROM PUBLIC HEALTH STANDPOINT. BUT WE DO KNOW THAT COMMUNITIES STILL UTILIZE THEM. AND I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT I WILL ALSO ASSOCIATE MY COMMENTS WITH THAT WILL BE MADE BY AND- FOLKS FROM EDF AN AUDUBON. AND SAYING THAT THE NATURAL HABITAT BENEFITS TO THESE PRODUCTS ARE ALSO- LAUDABLE- BUT PRIMARILY WANT TO FOCUS ON THE FACT THAT THESE COMMUNITIES ARE BEING IMPACTED NOW. WANTING TO SEE THE FUNDING MOVE NOW IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT- UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS THE UNEASE- FROM FROM FOLKS ABOUT.

AS YOUR ANALYSIS- POINTS OUT THE BUDGET PROPOSAL REQUESTS NINE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND. FOR STAFFING AND THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE GENERAL FUND FOR GRANTS TO THE NINETEEN GROUND WATER BASINS THAT ARE CRITICALLY OVER DRAFTED. AND ARE BEGINNING IMPLEMENTATION OF THEIR LOCAL GROUND WATER SUSTAINABILITY PLANS. OF THE DEPARTMENT WAS HAS BEEN IN RECEIPT OF. OF THE GROUND WATER PLANS FOR THOSE CRITICALLY OVER DRAFTED BASINS OF THE DEADLINE WAS JANUARY THIRTY FIRST- EVERYONE SUBMITTED WHICH IS GREAT WE'VE OPENED A PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD- ONE THAT- CLOSES ON APRIL FIFTEENTH. AND ANOTHER THAT CLOSES ON MAY FOURTH AND ARE. STARTING TO RECEIVE PUBLIC COMMENTS FROM VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS- AS TO THE EFFICACY OF THOSE PLANS. I WILL BE CLEAR THAT ONCE THOSE PLANS ARE SUBMITTED TO THE DEPARTMENT THE DEPARTMENT HAS A TWO YEAR PERIOD TO RENDER AT A JUDGMENT ON THEIR ADEQUACY. BUT OF THOSE GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT AGENCIES BEGIN IMPLEMENTING THOSE PLANS RIGHT AWAY. OF THE THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT WE HAVE IN OUR BUDGET REQUEST I WOULD BE MADE AVAILABLE TO EACH OF THE CRITICALLY OVER DRAFTED BASINS. TO SUPPORT PLANNING AND PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION NEEDED TO ADDRESS BROADER ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF SIGMA IMPLEMENTATION. THE PROPOSAL INCLUDES A ONE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO BE PROVIDED TO THE LOCAL A LOCAL AGENCY LEADING THE BASINS OVERALL EFFORT FOR THE PURPOSE OF IDENTIFYING THESE POTENTIAL ECONOMIC DISRUPTIONS- IN EXPLORING WAYS TO ADDRESS THEM. LOCAL GROUND WATER AGENCIES WOULD BE REQUIRED TO COORDINATE WITH THE OVERLAYING COUNTY TO ENSURE THAT THESE EFFORTS ARE CONSISTENT WITH COUNTY PLANNING AND OTHER PERMITTING REQUIREMENTS. WE ARE AWARE OF THE LA USE RECOMMENDATION- TO LEGISLATIVELY PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL DIRECTION REGARDING THE FUNDING FOR PROPOSED LOCAL ASSISTANCE AND WE ARE GLAD TO WORK WITH YOU ALL IN. THE COMING WEEKS TO MAKE SURE DOLLARS ARE ARE FOCUSED ON THE RIGHT KINDS OF ACTIVITIES THE STAFF COMMENTS ALSO REFERENCE A CONCERN FROM THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITY. ABOUT THE ADEQUACY OF LOCAL GROUND WATER PLANTS IN ADDRESSING IMPACTS TO DRINKING WATER WELLS. D. W. R. SHARES THOSE CONCERNS ABOUT IMPACTS TO DRINKING WATER WELLS AND WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE LOWERING OF GROUND WATER LEVELS AFFECTS ALL ELEMENTS OF SIGMA'S PRIORITIES DEGRADED WATER QUALITY SUBSIDENCE SEA WATER INTRUSION AND DEPLETION OF INTERCONNECTED SURFACE WATERS. DO YOU HAVE YOU ARE IS REQUIRED TO REVIEW THESE GROUND WATER SUSTAINABILITY PLANS FOR THEIR ABILITY TO ADEQUATELY ADDRESS THESE IMPACTS THE PLANTS NEED TO IDENTIFY THE IMPACTS OF CONTINUED GROUNDWATER DEPLETION AND HOW THOSE IMPACTS AFFECT ALL BENEFICIAL USES AND HOW THOSE- IMPACTS ARE ADDRESSED THROUGH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THOSE PLANS. OUTSIDE OF THE SPECIFIC REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS OF SIGMA THE STATE OF SEVERAL PROGRAMS THAT INTERFACE WITH GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT INCLUDING SAFE DRINKING WATER EFFORTS WATER STORAGE PROJECTS AND CONSOLIDATION OF SMALL WATER SYSTEMS. AND WITH THAT ALL. TURN IT OVER TO ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU BEFORE WE GO TO LA- IF YOU COULD- JUST BE A LITTLE BIT MORE SPECIFIC ABOUT THE- HOW- THE DEPARTMENT WILL. INTEGRATE INTO ITS- PLANNING ON ON- ON THIS THE CONCERNS OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE- ORGANIZATIONS THAT YOU JUST REFERENCED AT IF YOU COULD JUST ADD SOME SPECIFICITY TO THAT I THINK THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL SURE YOU BET MAYBE ALSO A FEW WORDS AND THEN TURN IT OVER TO MS ROBBINS ANY- WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE COMMUNITY WATER CENTER AND LEADERSHIP COUNCIL AND OTHER ENTITIES THAT HAVE BEEN RAISING THESE QUESTIONS THEY HAVE- VERY HELPFULLY PROVIDED A- I WOULD CALL AND I'D B<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; T&lt;/c&gt;</u> MITIGATING IMPACTS ON TO. QUELL DOMESTIC WELL IMPACTS AS A RESULT OF SIGMA IMPLEMENTATION AND THEY POINT OUT A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT ISSUES THAT ARE- MAY BE PROBLEMATIC IN THE PLANS THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS RECEIVED SOME OF IT RELATES TO QUALITY OF DATA- SOME OF IT RELATES TO- REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR- MONITORING OF SIGMA IMPLEMENTATION INTO THE FUTURE- ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE UNDER CONSIDERATION BY THE DEPARTMENT AS WE EMBARK ON THIS TWO YEAR REVIEW PERIOD- AND WE ANTICIPATE. MULTIPLE COMMENTS ON OTHER TOPICS THAT GET AT THIS ISSUE OF WHAT REPRESENTS ADEQUATE NEGATION OF IMPACTS TO BENEFIT USES THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED BY THE AND STEM CELL IS RISING YOU HAVE FEW EXAMPLE OF MAY ELUCIDATE THE REVIEW THIS TOP THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL CERTAINLY A GOOD MORNING- REMEMBER. I TURNER NEED TO BE DIRECT THE WAY MANAGEMENT FOR THE DEPARTMENT WATER. AND I HOW RECKONING THAT HAD JUST EXPLAINS- REALLY WHAT IS A VERY KIND OF TECHNICAL ASPECT OF REVIEWING THESE PLANS AND HOW WE'RE TRYING TO WEAVE INTO- INTO THAT TECHNICAL REVIEW. THE REAL- REAL TIME ISSUES THAT ARE OF CONCERN FOR MANY OF THE STAKEHOLDERS AND A LOCAL WATER MANAGERS OUT WHAT WE WILL BE NEEDING TO DO- IS NOT ONLY LOOK AT THOSE PLANS OURSELVES BUT WE WILL BE TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE PUBLIC COMMENTS THAT ARE PROVIDED TO US AND IT IS ISSUES LIKE THOSE THAT ARE RAISED HERE. TODAY BY- CERTAIN ADVOCACY GROUP THAT WE REALLY I GENUINELY APPRECIATE BECAUSE IT ALLOWS US TO HAVE- KIND OF AT THE SAME TIME THAT WE'RE REVIEWING THE PLANS WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO ADDRESS BROADER POLICY LEVEL DISCUSSIONS. AT THAT NEED TO HAPPEN IN SUPPORT OF MOVING FORWARD WITH THIS ABLE GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT. OF THE DEPARTMENT WHEN WE ARE REVIEWING THE PLANS SHOULD WE GET TO A POINT. THAT WE RECOGNIZE THIS UP PLAN HAS ALL OF THE COMPONENTS THE FUNDAMENTAL COMPONENTS TO BE AN ADEQUATE PLAN FOR REACHING SUSTAINABILITY IN A TWENTY YEAR PERIOD PER THE REGULATIONS IN THE LAW. WE WILL ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT ALL THESE PLANS ARE NOT GOING TO BE PERFECT AND SO THEY WILL NEED CORRECTIVE ACTIONS AND RECOMMENDED ACTIONS ON THE PART OF DEPARTMENT AND IT IS THROUGH THAT- ASKED. OF THE REVIEW AND HOW WE'RE INTERACTING WITH GROUND STING A BILL AGENCIES THAT WE CAN BETTER TARGET. THE WORK NEEDS TO BE. TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT EACH MINUTE LOCAL BILL IS BEING IS A PROPERLY IT SING THE BENEFICIAL YOU. IT WILL VERY BY BASIN- AGAIN THE BASIN- ISSUES ARE VERY UNIQUE. AND THEREFORE- THAT'S WHY THE LOCAL- MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE THAT CIGNA PROVIDED- IT REMAINS A CENTRAL TENANT SO OUR JOB IS TO REALLY HELP. THEM ADDRESS THE ISSUES THAT THEY HAVE. THANK YOU- DID YOU WANT TO ADD I WOULD ADD- EVER SO BRIEFLY THAT- WE ARE COORDINATING WITH THE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD- ON ISSUES OF WATER QUALITY PARTICULARLY AROUND. THE SB TWO HUNDRED AND FUNDING THAT THEY HAVE AVAILABLE TO SOLVE CLEAN DRINKING WATER PROBLEMS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY- SO THAT WE CAN ENSURE THAT- THE OBLIGATIONS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL ARE. ARE BORN AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND AREN'T WORSENING CONDITIONS- THAT SB TWO HUNDRED FUNDING WAS DESIGNED TO ADDRESS SO IT'S GOING TO BE AN ONGOING CONVERSATION THAT WILL NEED TO- PRESENT HERE AT THE LEGISLATURE OVER TIME AS WE START TO SORT OUT- WHAT SEGMENT SIGMA IMPLEMENTATION LOOKS LIKE ON THE GROUND. THANK YOU- I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU- THAT WHERE AN INFLECTION POINT WHEN IT COMES TO. A CLEAN AND SAFE DRINKING WATER AND A CLEANING UP SOME OF THE- STANDING. WATER QUALITY ISSUES THAT WE HAVE AROUND THE STATE. WE OWE IT TO THE PUBLIC WHO HAVE BEEN- WAITING FOR DECADES FOR THIS MOMENT TO ARRIVE TO GET THIS RIGHT AND- SO I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS BUT OF. WANT TO ADD THAT CONTEXT TO THEM BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS JUST SO IMPORTANT LA- YOU'VE BEEN PATIENT WILL HAVE TO GO HEAD- THANK YOU THAT SO OBVIOUSLY SIGMA IS A HUGE PRIORITY FOR THE STATE AND IS AT A REALLY CRITICAL PERIOD OF ITS IMPLEMENTATION RIGHT NOW WITH THESE- INITIAL- BASINS COMING IN AND SUBMITTING THEIR PLAN SO WE THINK THAT THE DEPARTMENT'S REQUEST FOR NINE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS TO. HELP SUPPORT AND DO THOSE IS JUSTIFIED WOULD RECOMMEND ADOPTING THAT AS DIRECTOR NEMETH MENTION FOR THE THIRTY MILLION AND LOCAL ASSISTANCE WE WOULD RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE ADOPT SOME LINKAGE BUT SOME PARAMETERS AROUND THOSE FUNDS AND SPECIFICALLY TO ENSURE THAT THERE USED FOR PUBLIC BENEFIT AND NOT PRIVATE BENEFIT. AND THAT THEY ARE USED TO FURTHER THAT ACTIVE IMPLEMENTATION OF GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY PLANS AND NOT- OTHER TYPES OF PROJECTS THAT MAY BE OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OFREALLY STATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR IMPLEMENTING SEGMENT. THANK YOU- DEPARTMENT FINANCE- ALL RIGHT WE'RE GONNA HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN WILL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT AT THE ND- OF- A DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES- IS RIVAS DID YOU HAVE A QUESTION OR COMMENT YEAH I JUST HAVE A FEW COMMENTS I'VE YOU KNOW KNOWING THAT WE JUST RECENTLY APPROVED- POSITIONS THAT DID OF YOU ARE TO IMPLEMENT SB THREE OH SEVEN. UP LAST YEAR- WHICH I WAS A CO AUTHOR I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT THE NEED TO DO ADDITIONAL OVERSIGHT OVER PROPOSALS THE SEEK TO EXTRACT WATER FROM DESERT FIRES- YOU KNOW THEY'RE OUT I KNOW THERE WAS A COMMENT IN HERE ABOUT- FUTURE GROUNDWATER TRANSFER PROJECTS. IN LINDA HAZARDS AND I WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE. IN MINISTRATION AND THE DEPARTMENT TO LOOK AT ADDITIONAL NEED TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT. OF PROPOSALS THAT ONE EXTRACT WATER FROM MARK DESERT- SO THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO ME- BUT I HAVEN'T ANOTHER QUESTION YOU KNOW. HOW DO YOU THINK WE CAN- I IMPLEMENT SIGMA IN A MANNER THAT MAKES FRONT LINE COMMUNITIES MORE DROUGHT AND CLIMATE CHANGE RESILIENT. IT'S A GOOD QUESTION AND SIGNAL REALLY IS ABOUT- HELPING CALIFORNIA MANAGE BETTER- THROUGH DRY PERIODS SO AS- SECTOR CROWFOOT MENTIONED- MAYBE AN HOUR OR SO AGO- THAT- THE SITUATION AROUND WATER BASINS IS THE RESULT OF DECADES OF ESSENTIALLY PUMPING DURING DRY TIMES BUT NOT REFILLING WHEN IT'S WET AND THAT IS FUNDAMENTALLY THE OBJECTIVE OF SIGMA TO BRING THOSE GROUND WATER BASINS INTO BALANCE ND SO WE DO IN CALIFORNIA- DURING DRY TIMES. OF MOST OF CAL DEPENDS ON GROUND WATER TO- MAKE THEIR COMMUNITIES- MEET THEIR COMMUNITIES WATER NEEDS AND THEIR LOCAL ECONOMIC NEEDS AND THAT'S GOING TO CONTINUE INTO THE FUTURE AND THAT'S NOT A BAD THING WE JUST NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE. THE ACTIONS READY ESPECIALLY- DURING DRY TIMES TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE PUTTING THAT WATER- WERE RECHARGING THOSE GROUND WATER BASINS AND REFILLING THAT ACCOUNT IF YOU WILL SOME OF THOSE KINDS OF PROJECTS THAT WE'RE LOOKING MOST INTENSIVELY AT OUR MANAGING FLOOD WATERS IN A DIFFERENT WAY. AND THE AND IS INVOLVED IN EXTENSIVE STUDIES- PILOT STUDIES IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE STATE WHERE WE ARE ASSESSING SOIL CONDITIONS WE'RE ASSESSING- FLOOD CONDITIONS WITH VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT KIND OF LOCALIZED CONVEYANCE PROJECTS MIGHT BE HELPFUL. I'M IN THIS. THE RECHARGE OF RAP WATER BASINS WHEN WE HAVE A REALLY WET HYDROLOGY COMING THROUGH THE STATE. GREAT CAST I THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I THINK WHAT I'LL ASK YOU TO DO NOW ON ISSUES EIGHT THROUGH ELEVEN THIS. GIVE US A- A THUMBNAIL SKETCH ON ON- EACH OF THOSE- STAFF HASN'T- IDENTIFIED ANY PARTICULAR ISSUES WITH THIS WILL BE ABLE TO. TAKE VOTES TO A UP THE PROOF- AND THEN WILL- MOVED TO PUBLIC COMMENT. CERTAINLY ISSUE EIGHT HYDRO METEOROLOGY AND SURFACE WATER OBSERVATIONS THIS PROPOSAL REQUEST SIX MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE GENERAL FUND AND ELEVEN POSITIONS TO SUPPORT THE HYDRO METEOROLOGY AND SURFACE WATER OBSERVATIONS PROGRAMS WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES. THE DEPARTMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY REMOTE WEATHER STATIONS THAT PROVIDE CRITICAL INFORMATION FOR FLOOD EMERGENCY RESPONSE AND WATER SUPPLY FORECASTING. THE SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUNDS PROVIDE STAFFING RESOURCES AND EQUIPMENT TO ENHANCE SURFACE WATER MONITORING BY RE ACTIVATING OR UPGRADING EXISTING MONITORING STATIONS WERE INSTALLING NEW STATIONS TO ADDRESS KNOWN INFORMATION GAPS. THE OBSERVATIONS BY THESE MONITORING SITES ARE INCREASINGLY CRUCIAL TO SMART WATER MANAGEMENT CALIFORNIA GIVEN CLIMATE IMPACTS ON OUR HYDROLOGY AND OUR NEW IMPERATIVE TO BRING GROUND WATER BASINS INTO BALANCE I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY SUFFICIENT CELEBRATE FORCE. A AND ON THE ISSUE NINE. ISSUE NINE- FLOOD MANAGEMENT SUPPORT. SUBCOMMITTEE STAFF HAS REQUESTED THAT WE DISCUSS ACTUALLY ISSUES NINE TEN AND ELEVEN TOGETHER AS THEY ALL ARE COMPLEMENTARY GREAT- LET ME NOTE- THE IMPORTANT COOPERATIVE COMPONENT OF THESE PROPOSALS. FLOOD MANAGEMENT IN CALIFORNIA IS A SHARED RESPONSIBILITY AMONG STATE FEDERAL AND LOCAL AGENCIES D. W. R. HAS GENERAL FLOOD MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND A MORE SPECIFIC ROLE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. WHILE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE IN RECENT YEARS OUR STATE'S EXPOSURE TO FLOOD RISK REMAINS A SUBSTANTIAL THREAT TO PUBLIC SAFETY INFRASTRUCTURE AND OUR ECONOMY. THESE PROPOSALS SUPPORT THE DELIVERY OF LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL FLOOD AND MULTI BENEFIT PROJECTS THAT ARE NECESSARY TO MEET THE STATE'S OBLIGATIONS TO MAINTAIN AND OPERATE FLOOD CONTROL INFRASTRUCTURE. ISSUES NINE AND ELEVEN ARE RELATED AS ISSUE NINE WOULD PROVIDE A EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS TO SUPPORT THREE POSITIONS THAT ARE VITAL TO THE PROJECT WORK. THAT WOULD BE FUNDED BY THE FORTY THREE MILLION DOLLAR IN GENERAL FUND PROPOSAL A PROPOSED UNDER ISSUE ELEVEN. THESE POSITIONS WOULD PLAN PRIORITIZE AND MANAGE PROJECTS AS WELL AS PREPARE OUR SECRET DOCUMENTS. THE FORTY SIX MILLION DOLLAR IN GENERAL FUND- IN ISSUE ELEVEN WOULD SUPPORT THE AMERICAN RIVER WORK UNDERTAKEN IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS. AND THE SACRAMENTO AREA FLOOD CONTROL AGENCY. THE FUNDING WILL SUPPORT THE CONSTRUCTION OF LEVY IMPROVEMENT MEASURES FOR THE EAST LEVY OF THE SACRAMENTO RIVER DOWNSTREAM OF THE AMERICAN RIVER. SEVERAL OTHER LEVY AND A ROAD IN CONTROL PROJECTS IN THE AMERICAN RIVER SYSTEM. AND THE WIDENING OF THE SACRAMENTO WE'RE AND BYPASS TO DELIVER MORE FLOOD FLOWS INTO THE YOLO BYPASS. AS THE SUBCOMMITTEE AGENDA NOTES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS ALREADY COMMITTED MORE THAN ONE AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS TO THESE PROJECTS. THE REQUESTED FUNDING HERE IS- THE STATE CONTRIBUTION TO THAT EFFORT GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH LA- ANY COMMENTS. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ANYTHING FURTHER. IS THERE- ARE THERE ANY COMMENTS ON THIS SAYS THERE ARE A. IS A WE HAVE TO LEAVE BEFORE CUT PUBLIC COMMENT. YOUR OWN OKAY ALL RIGHT LET'S TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT TO ON ISSUES FIVE THROUGH ELEVEN. THAT'S RIGHT WE TOOK FIVE AND SIX OF SEVEN THROUGH ELEVEN. GOOD AFTERNOON ROBERT CORPS FROM THE QUALCOMM GROUP ON BEHALF OF SACRAMENTO MENTAL AREA FLOOD CONTROL AGENCY WEREN'T STRONG SUPPORT WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE HAVE YOU ARE FOR DECADES ON THIS AS WELL AS CONGRESSMAN MATT SO WE- ARE WE THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO LEVERAGE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION. I THANK YOU. THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS JONATHAN NELSON WITH THAT COMMUNITY ONE OR SUTTER ON ITEM SEVEN WANT TO START- BY EXPRESSING APPRECIATION TO DIRECTOR NY MATH. ON W. DIRECTOR RATHER ZENI AND REALLY OUR ENTIRE TEAM- BECAUSE WE'VE HAD SEVERAL CONVERSATIONS NOW AND YOU'VE REALLY OPEN YOUR DOORS TO US AND WE APPRECIATE THAT- AND WOULD ALSO LIKE TO- FOLLOW UP- AT A DIFFERENT TIME ON THE LA- PUBLIC. OUTREACH MATTER- WHICH WE- I WOULD LIKE TO BE HELPFUL ON- BUT WE'RE HERE TODAY- TO SOUND THE ALARM THAT BASED ON. THE GS PIECE OR GROUND WATER SUSTAINABILITY PLANS THAT WE REVIEWED- AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND THE CENTRAL COAST- THAT. THESE JUST PEACEFUL SEVERELY NEGATIVELY IMPACT ACCESS TO SAFE WATER FOR MORE NOBLE COMMUNITIES UNLESS COURSE CORRECTED BY. OTHER DEPARTMENT A AND THE STATE WATER BOARD AS PART OF YOUR CHEST PEER REVIEW PROCESS. I'M MORE FUN. WE ARE REAL CONCERNED IF THESE PLANS. ARE RUBBER STAMPED. OUT AS A IS THAT IMPLEMENTATION OF SIGMA WILL UNDERCUT THE PROGRESS OF THE LEGISLATURE IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE HAVE MADE. ON ACCESS TO SAFE WATER EVEN JUST LAST YEAR AND SO FOR EXAMPLE- JUST TO GIVE YOU. A SENSE OF WHAT WE'RE SEEING- CLEAN WATER ADVOCATES ESTIMATE THAT OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS. WILL BE IMPACTED. ARE POTENTIALLY LOSING WATER- BASED ON HOW THE MINIMUM THRESHOLDS HAVE BEEN THAT. I AND THESE ARE BASED ON ONLY REVIEW OF JUST SEVEN. CENTRAL VALLEY GS PEAS. WE DO WANT TO BE HELPFUL TO THE DEPARTMENT AND THE WATER BOARD SO WE WILL BE SENDING AND- WILL COMMENT LETTERS- WITH EXTENSIVE ANALYSIS. LEASES MUCH KNOX'S CAN DO. WITH OUR- AWAY. OUT OF THE ATTACKS. TO LOW INCOME IT IS A- WHAT ABOUT THE PLANS THAT. WE ARE RIPPING. WHAT ABOUT THOSE COMMUNITIES. IN THEIR ACCESS TO SAFE WATER. AND WE'RE ALSO LOW AT. QUANTITY AND- WE ARE NOT LOOKING FOR QUALITY BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY TO DO THAT BUT WE ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT WATER QUALITY IMPACTS AS WELL. TO ARE VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES SO TO CLOSE WE NEED THE DEPARTMENT AND THE STATE WATER BOARD TO REVIEW EVERY PLAN- AT FOUR AND ASK THE QUESTION OF HOW WILL THIS PLAN. IMPACT BOTH WATER QUANTITY AND QUALITY FOR VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES- BUT WITHIN THAT GSA AND IF THE STATE DOES NOT ASK THOSE QUESTIONS AND THEN PLAN. ACCORDINGLY WE BELIEVE THAT WE WILL UNDER CUT IN A REALLY MAJOR WAY THE PROGRESS E'VE MADE ON SAFE WATER. OF LAST YEAR THANK YOU ALL. GOOD AFTERNOON MICHAEL CLAIBORNE WITH LEADERSHIP COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE COMMENT- NIGHT ECHO A LOT OF THE COMMENTS THAT WERE JUST MADE BY JONATHAN NELSON ABOUT THE GOOD MEETINGS THAT WE'VE HAD WITH. DIRECTOR NEMETH AS WELL AS CHAIR ASK ABOUT THE STATE WATER BOARD. AND WE KNOW THAT THEY'RE TAKING THESE ISSUES ABOUT IMPACTS OF SIGMAR AND EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION OF SAME- ON DRINKING WATER RESOURCES VERY SERIOUSLY- MORE WORKING WITH AND REPRESENT COMMUNITIES THAT WERE THE FIRST TO SEE WELLS GO DRY DURING THE LAST DROUGHT. I'LL BE THE FIRST TO SEE WILD GOT DRY DURING THE NEXT DROUGHT AND- AS IS MORE PERTINENT TODAY THE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE CONTINUED TO SEE WELL JUST GO TRY EVEN AFTER THE LAST ROUTE ENDED. BECAUSE OF OVER PUMPING OF GROUNDWATER RESOURCES. SO WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR TODAY IS ASSURANCES JAZZ PIECE WILL EFFECTIVELY REVIEWED WE'VE SEEN SOME REALLY. POOR GRAY SO THE BILL PLANS EIGHT AS AN EXAMPLE ONE AND ARE ALLIES CHAU TO UP. EIGHTY OF DOMESTIC WELLS IN THE PLAN YEAH WOULD GO DROP BY IF WATER TABLES FELT THE LEVEL THAT THE PLAN WAS TO ALLOW. THE RESPONSE FROM THE BEST P. U. S. ARE THE GSA'S WAS AS IT'S NOT 80% IT'S ONLY ABOUT IS COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE. SO WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS FUNDING TO MAKE SURE THE CAN. CONTINUE TO BE AGED IN THIS PROCESS. THAT THEIR INFORMATION ABOUT IMPACTS ARE. FULLY OPERATED. AS WELL AS FUNDING FOR X. THAT ARE GONNA BETTER THIS IS COMMUNITY. AND IS ONE MORE JUST THE RESOURCES IN A ASSURANCE THAT DATA R. AS TO HAVE THE RESOURCES IT NEEDS TO EVALUATE THESE PLANS FULLY AND EVALUATE IMPACTS ON DRINKING WATER. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON NOW- PUBLIC GARCIA WITH ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE FUND AND ALSO- MAKING COMMENTS ON BEHALF OF THE NATURE CONSERVANCY. CYCLE YOU HAVE THE WEEK- FIRST OFF I I'LL START ECHO WHAT OTHERS HAVE SAID WE REALLY APPRECIATE. THE WORK TO DEPARTMENT IS DOING AND RECENT MEETINGS WE HAD IN THEIR APPROACH TO THE REVIEW OF GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY PLANTS- YEAH WE'RE REALLY ENCOURAGED BY. THE STEPS ARE TAKING TO DEAL WITH FIRST DAY WISH OF WORK THAT'S COMING HAS COME AT THEM. AND ALONG THOSE LINES WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE NINE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS YOU KNOW OUR STAFFING AUGMENTATION FUNDING. THAT'S PART OF THE REQUEST- YET JEREMY SAID RIGHT INFLECTION POINT AND SAFE DRINKING WATER WERE ALSO AN INFLECTION POINT ON GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT. AND INCITING THIS IS A REAL YOU KNOW SIGMA IS REAL NOW WE NEED TO. YEAH IT'S TO THE- DEPARTMENT GETS I DON'T ENVY THAT POSITION THERE AND BUT THEY HAVE TO GET THE STEP UP AND READ THESE PLANTS AND- YOU KNOW I LIKE DEFICIENCIES. EGGS AND ALONG WITH. COLLEAGUES JUST EMPHASIZE ON SAFE DRINKING WATER WE SHARE THAT CONCERN THAT. SOME OF THESE DRAFT PLANS ARE SHOWING YOU KNOW A CONTINUE DECLINING GROUND WATER LEVELS. WHICH IS REALLY UNACCEPTABLE FOR THE BIG THE COMMUNITIES THAT. ARE DEPENDING ON ON THAT RESOURCE. SAVING IS. HOPE THAT YOU'RE AT REQUEST THAT THE DEPARTMENTS IN THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD REALLY TAKEN AYE TO THAT ISSUE AS A REVIEW THESE PLANS IN THE COMING MONTHS IN NEXT YEAR'S. THE PART OF THE BUDGET REQUEST IS THE THIRTY MILLION AND WE'RE REALLY PLEASE ALSO TO SEE THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND BEING ASKED FOR FOUR OF THE VARIETY OF ACTIVITIES ASSOCIATED WITH SIGNAL WE THINK IT'S NECESSARY NEEDED PARTICULAR AT THIS MOMENT- INDIA THEIR EARLIER EXCHANGE BETWEEN SECRETARY CRAWFORD AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER PATTERSON ABOUT. KIND OF THE ECONOMIC PAIN THAT. IS POTENTIALLY WILL OCCUR IN THE VALLEY SO WE THINK THE STATE DEFINITELY HAS A ROLE TO PLAY HERE AND IT'S MAKE INVESTMENTS TO GET OUT AHEAD OF THAT. YOU HAVE A- OR ALSO APPRECIATE THE MENTION THE GROUND WATER TRADING- IN THE B. C. P. AND OTHER SOME CONCERNS AROUND THAT BUT WITH SOMETHING WE SUPPORT WE THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT TOOL. TO DEAL WITH THE LIMITATIONS ON SUPPLY. WE WOULD YOU KNOW OF SUBMIT BATES YOU KNOW THE IDENTIFYING BEST PRACTICES FOR GROUND WATER TRADING PROGRAM. THAT ADDRESSES THE NEEDS OF COMMUNITIES AND THE ECOSYSTEM IS REALLY IMPORTANT- SO WE DON'T DO. TRADING OF AS WE'VE SEEN IN THE PAST BUT WE DO IT IN A BETTER WAY THAT IS. NOT HAVING ADVERSE IMPACTS ALL THAT'S IT YOU ANOTHER ONE AGAIN SIR CONCERN I GUESS WITH THE THIRTY MILLION IS WHAT WE LIKE TO SEE MORE DETAIL ON ECONOMIC MITIGATION PLANNING SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING WE NEED- BUT I'M NOT TOTALLY SURE WHAT IT IS AND I YOU KNOW I'LL GO FURTHER SAY NOT. I YOU WITHALL DUE RESPECT TO THE APARTMENT ORDER RESOURCES I THINK THE TEAM IS GREAT BUT IT'S I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S OUR CORE EXPERTISE IS SORT OF WHAT'S ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IMPACTS HERE SORRY I THINK JUST CONTINUE THAT DIALOGUE ABOUT WHAT WHAT'S OUR ACTIVITIES THE DEPARTMENT REALLY REALIZES. WE NEED TO INVOLVE EMPLOYER DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT OR OTHER SORT OF EXPERTISE WITHIN STATE GOVERNMENT HERE. AND THEN I. TWO FINAL POINTS A THE THIRTY MILLION I WOULD IMPLORE THEY TO BE SPENT ON ACTIVITIES THAT WE DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE OTHER RESOURCES FOR WE'RE TALKING ABOUT GROUND WATER RECHARGE PROJECTS I THINK THERE'S SOME BOND FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR THAT AND WE SHOULD EMPHASIZE ON THE GREAT THING ABOUT GENERAL FUND IT'S FLEXIBLE YOU CAN DO ABOUT OTHER THINGS YOU CAN'T DO WITH BOND FUND SERVICE IDENTIFY THOSE ACTIVITIES- IN IN A LOT YOU YOUR ONE DO YOU ITEM MIGHT BE STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT WERE SAYING- DEFICIENCIES AND STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT. IN A DRAFT USP SO THAT MIGHT BE SOMETHING THE DEPARTMENT COULD CONSIDER FUNDING I THINK WOULD HELP WITH ECONOMIC MITIGATION ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH IMPLEMENTING SIX. SO ALL THAT SAID THANK YOU AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THE DIALOGUE WITH THE DEPARTMENT COMMITTEE. WHICH CHAIR MEMBERS PAT RAN WITH THEIR AND READING ASSOCIATES REPRESENTING THE PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERS IN CALIFORNIA GOT. SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL SPECIFICALLY THE NINE MILLION DOLLARS- AND THE NEW POSITIONS- THAT ARE PROVIDED FOR IN IT EIGHTEEN OF WITCHER ENGINEERING POSITIONS- WE BELIEVE THESE POSITIONS WERE ONLY HELP THE DEPARTMENT IN THE STATE- ACHIEVE THEIR GROUND WATER SUSTAINABILITY GOALS THANK YOU. STACEY SOLOMON SUSTAINABLE CONSERVATION OF WE WOULD LIKE TO ASSOCIATE OURSELVES WITH COMMENTS PREVIOUSLY MADE AND WITH THE OBSERVATIONS OF LA- AND STAFF CONCERNING THE IMPORTANCE OF THE DRINKING WATER ISSUE AND PARTICULARLY THE SHALLOW WELLS. OF WE THINK THAT THIS IS THIS IS A POTENTIAL CATASTROPHE AND WE FEEL THAT THERE ARE THINGS THAT CAN BE DONE AND SHOULD BE DONE-IN ORDER TO AVOID THAT. I APPRECIATED THE DIRECTOR. OF REFERRING TO RECHARGE- RECHARGES SOMETHING MY ORGANIZATION HAS BEEN SERIOUSLY INVOLVED WITH FOR A LONG TIME. AND WE'RE HAPPY TO BE- IT WORKING IN COLLABORATION WITH THE W. R. ON PROJECTS ON ON THAT ISSUE- AND WE THINK THAT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. IT'S POINTED OUT THAT THAT- A NUMBER OF THE GS PEAS THAT HAVE COME IN. OUR OUR- RELY HEAVILY ON THE IDEA OF RECHARGE AS A WAY TO DEAL WITH THE IMPACT OF SEQUENCE LIMITATION. WE DON'T THINK RECHARGES IS A PANACEA WE THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT. I AND WE SUPPORT THE IDEA OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE INCLUDING. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO GSA'S AT ARE INTERESTED IN DOING RECHARGE ABOUT HOW BEST TO DETERMINE WHERE THAT STUFF ON HOW THAT'S. A NUMBER OF THE JESUS PIECE WITH LOOKED AT SO FAR IS A- SERIOUS OF LACK OF EMPHASIS ON WATER QUALITY AND THAT THE WATER QUALITY ELEMENTS OF THE JEWS PEAS ARE ARE SERIOUSLY LACKING AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE FEEL IS VERY IMPORTANT IF RECHARGE IS GOING TO BE AN IMPORTANT PART OF IMPLEMENTATION WHICH WE FEEL IT SHOULD IS THAT THERE ARE WATER QUALITY DIMENSIONS TO RECHARGE THAT CAN BE BOTH OUT THERE CAN BE BOTH BENEFITS AND SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS. AND SO ONE OF THE PLACES WHERE WE HOPE TO SEE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDED IS NOT JUST SIMPLY IN THE MECHANICS ARE THE HIDE OF GETTING WATER INTO THE GROUND THROUGH OF FLOOD WATER- READER VERSIONS AND OTHER PROGRAMS BUT ALSO TO MAKE SURE THAT THE WATER QUALITY IMPACTS OF RECHARGER FULLY UNDERSTOOD BEFORE GSA'S ACTUALLY EMBARK IN THE IN IN IN IMPLEMENTING THEM. THANK YOU. ONE OF THEM IT ON A WITHOUT A BUNCH CALIFORNIA- WE WOULD LIKE TO A LEARNING THEIR COMMENTS- WITH THOSE OF OUR ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITY ALLIES AND- AND- ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE FUND THE NATURE CONSERVANCY. WE WHOLLY SUPPORT- BOTH- ASKS OF THE NINE POINT. FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AND THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS ONE THING THAT WE WOULD ASK IN THE STAFFING CAPACITY IS FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO CONSIDER- TO HAVE.
