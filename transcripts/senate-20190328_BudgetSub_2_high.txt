SUBCOMMITTEE ON NATURAL RESOURCES ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION ENERGY AND TRANSPORTATION WILL START AS A SUBCOMMITTEE -- WE HAVE RECEIVED SOME BITTERSWEET NEWS -- A REPUBLICAN CONSULTANT -- RAQUEL THAT IN COURT TO SITTING TO MY RIGHT IS RETIRING AND TODAY WILL BE HER LAST DAY WITH THE SENATE. SHE'S BEEN WITH THE CENTER FOR THIRTEEN YEARS AND HAS BEEN ON THIS SUBCOMMITTEE LEASE THE THREE YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN HERE AND INSTITUTIONS. SERVE THEM WITH DISTINCTION THIRTEEN YEARS AND AND TOTAL -- IN WORKING ON RESOURCES ENVIRONMENTAL -- BUDGET ISSUE SHE'S BEEN AN INTEGRAL PART OF OUR TEAM. HERE EVERY THURSDAY AT TEN FIFTEEN MINUTES AFTER GERMAN OUR STAFF SINGS YOUR PRAISES AND IF CONVEYED. TO ME HOW MUCH THEY'VE ENJOYED WORKING WITH YOU THIRTY YEARS AND YOU WILL BE MESS -- THANK YOU RECOUNT. FOR ALL THE WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE AND THE COMMITTEE FOR THE CENTER FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE WISH YOU A WONDERFUL. NEXT CHAPTER IN YOUR LIFE AND HAPPY TRAILS. SO WITH THAT WE WILL. JUMP TO PART A WHICH IS OUR PRESENTATION THE GREENHOUSE GAS -- FUN. MR BROWN GOOD MORNING THE ALLEY WILL HAVE HAS AN OVERVIEW -- SORRY FOR THAT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF RUST BROWN WITH THE LA -- I'M GONNA JUST GIVE A TRY TO GIVE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE PROPOSED CAP AND TRADE EXPENDITURE PLAN. I'M GONNA KIND OF BREAK IT UP INTO TWO DIFFERENT PARTS ONE JUST A HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW OF JUST THE BASIC STRUCTURE OF THE PLAN INCLUDING REVENUES AND EXPENDITURES AND FUND BALANCES IN KIND OF THE AMOUNT THAT MIGHT BE AVAILABLE FOR EXPENDITURES IN. IN THE BUDGET YEAR AND THEN TALK ABOUT JUST SOME OF THE SPECIFICS OF THE PROPOSED EXPENDITURES SO TO START OFF. THE TOP LEVEL -- THE TABLE ON PAGE FOUR OF YOUR AGENDA KINDA GIVES YOU. A MORE DETAILED PICTURE OF REVENUES AND EXPENDITURES AND FINE BALANCES -- THE ADMINISTRATION IS ASSUMING TWO POINT SIX BILLION IN REVENUE IN THE CURRENT YEAR AND TWO POINT ONE BILLION IN THE BUDGET YEAR -- AND IS PROPOSING A TWO POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLAR -- SPENDING PLAN AND THE BUDGET YEAR. INCLUDING CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATIONS AS WELL AS OTHER EXPENDITURES INCLUDING DISCRETIONARY EXPENDITURES. AND THAT WOULD LEAVE ACCORDING THEIR PROJECTIONS ARE LESS THAN ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR FUND BALANCE AT THE END OF THE YEAR AT THE END OF THE BUDGET YEAR. WE'VE PROJECTS THAT'S REVENUE OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS OF FLOWERS PRICES IN AUCTIONS CONTINUE THE WAY THAT THEY HAVE BEEN AROUND AT THE FLOOR PRICE. REVENUE WILL BE ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION MORE THAN WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROJECTING OVER THE TWO YEARS. AND THEN AFTER YOU TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE AMOUNT THAT GOES TO CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATIONS. THAT WOULD LEAVE ROUGHLY FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION IN THE FUND BALANCE AT THE END OF THE BUDGET YEAR. THERE'S STILL QUITE A BIT OF UNCERTAINTY. AROUND REVENUE AND SO WE DO THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE TO BE CAUTIOUS AND LEAVE SOME -- IN THE FUND BALANCE AT THE END OF THE BUDGET YEAR. BUT EVEN UNDER UNDER OUR PROJECTIONS EVEN IF THE LEGISLATURE WHERE TO SPEND FOR EXAMPLE A COUPLE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS MORE WE STILL THINK THAT WOULD LEAVE -- A HEALTHY RESERVE IN THE FUND BALANCE. THE SECOND ISSUE I WANT TO GET TO IS JUST THE MULTI YOUR OUTLOOK ON SPENDING JUST KIND OF LOOKING AT WHAT REVENUES MIGHT BE AGAIN A MARKET CONDITIONS CONTINUE THE WAY THEY ARE OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS -- WE PROJECT REVENUE WOULD BE ROUGHLY IN THE TWO POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLAR RANGE AND SO THAT LEAVES FOR DISCRETIONARY SPENDING -- SOMETHING CLOSE TO NINE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS -- FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO ALLOCATE IN FUTURE YEARS REVENUE AGAIN STAYS THE WAY THAT HAS BEEN -- SO WE JUST WANT TO KEEP THAT IN MIND WHEN YOU'RE KIND OF THINKING ABOUT LONG TERM SPENDING YOU KNOW ROUGHLY NINE HUNDRED MILLION -- GOING FORWARD AND THINKING ABOUT. WHEN YOU COMMIT TO KIND OF MULTI YEAR SPENDING -- KIND OF KEEPING THAT WILL TELL YOUR SPENDING BELOW THAT AMOUNT -- THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL HAS ROUGHLY FIVE HUNDRED MILLION AND MULTI YEAR SPENDING ON IT SO THAT IS LOWER THAN. THE NINE HUNDRED MILLION. AND THEN FINALLY THE JUST A KIND OF VERY A TECHNICAL ISSUE AROUND THE THE BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE WHICH WOULD GIVE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SOME AUTHORITY. TO REDUCE SOME OF THE ALLOCATIONS OF REVENUE COMES AND BELOW WHAT'S EXPECTED WE THINK THAT'S A VERY -- A REASONABLE APPROACH GENERALLY TO KIND OF ADDRESSING SOME OF THE UNCERTAINTY AROUND REVENUE. DOES THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND AUTHORITIES HERE TO MAKE. SOME OF THOSE REDUCTIONS OTHER PROGRAMS WOULD BE LEFT HOLE ONE HIGHLIGHT THAT FOR YOU AND JUST MAKE SURE. THAT THOSE -- KIND OF REDUCTIONS pTHE LEGISLATURE PRIORITIZES SOME OF THOSE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS IN WHICH ONE SHOULD BE CAPITAL. SO WITH THAT I'LL JUST MOVE ON TO A BRIEF DISCUSSION OF THE SPENDING PLAN ITSELF SO ON PAGE. SIX OF YOUR HAND OF YOUR AGENDA EXCUSE ME HAS A TABLE. OF THE PROPOSED SPENDING PLAN AND A COMPARISON TO WHAT THE EXPENDITURES WERE LAST YEAR NOT GONNA GO THROUGH ALL OF THESE -- ALL THE DIFFERENT PROPOSALS I THINK JUST IN GENERAL IT'S LARGELY CONTINUATION OF PROVIDING FUNDS TO PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN FUNDED WITH THREE G. R. F. IN THE PAST. SOME OF THE AMOUNTS ARE A LITTLE BIT LOWER THAT'S LARGELY -- REFLECTION OF THE LOWER EXPECTED RESOURCES AND REVENUE THAT'S AVAILABLE IN THE BUDGET YEAR -- THERE ARE SOME DIFFERENT AMOUNTS FOR DIFFERENT PROGRAMS I THINK ONE JUST A HIGHLIGHT I THINK YOU'LL BE HEARING THAT IN THE NEXT PART OF YOUR AGENDA THE ONLY REAL KIND OF NEW PROGRAM THAT'S BEING PROPOSED AS THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD PROPOSAL -- AND SO I WON'T. TALK ABOUT THAT IN DETAIL BUT JUST WANTED TO FLAG THAT FOR YOU. A COUPLE OF ISSUES TO CONSIDER WHEN YOU'RE KIND OF LOOKING AT THE PLAN ONE IS FOR A LOT OF THE PROPOSALS. BUT NOT A LOT OF DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT KIND OF WHAT THE EXPECTED OUTCOMES ARE FOR A LOT OF THE AREAS OF FUNDING -- IN SOME CASES EVEN JUST KIND OF A NUMBER OF PROJECTS WOULD BE FUNDED BUT THEN ALSO EXPECTED GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS OR OTHER TYPES OF BENEFITS AND SO. WE THINK OR RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE TO DIRECT THE ADMINISTRATION TO GOT A REPORT ON WHAT TO EXPECT SOME OF THOSE OUTCOMES TO BE WE DO RECOGNIZE THAT. SOMETIMES IT CAN BE DIFFICULT BUT WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR YOU MAKING DECISIONS ON HOW TO PRIORITIZE FUNDING AS WELL AS KEEPING THE ADMINISTRATION ACCOUNTABLE FOR WHAT THEY EXPECT GOING FORWARD. ANOTHER ISSUE WE DO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT IS THAT SOME OF THE PROGRAM SOME FOR SOME PROGRAMS SOME ADJUSTMENTS TO THE PROGRAMS MIGHT BE NEEDED IN THE BUDGET YEAR UNDER THE PROPOSED. ALLOCATIONS SO FOR EXAMPLE -- THEIR RESOURCES BOARD TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE CLEAN VEHICLE REBATE PROJECTS -- PROPOSAL CONSISTENT WITH AN ACTION THAT WAS ADOPTED LAST YEAR IS TO PROVIDE TWO HUNDRED MILLION FOR THOSE REBATES -- UNDER SOME A CARBS RECENT PROJECTIONS THE DEMAND FOR THOSE REBATES WILL BE SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER THAN THAT -- IN THE BUDGET YEAR AND SO THAT MIGHT MEAN SOME ADJUSTMENTS TO THE PROGRAM WHAT ABOUT ME AND BE SORT OF THE AMOUNT OF THE REBATE OR WHO IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE REBATE. AND SO YOU MIGHT WANT TO ASK THE THE ADMINISTRATION TO REPORT ON KIND OF WHAT TYPES OF ADJUSTMENTS THEY EXPECT TO MAKE IN ORDER TO KIND OF STAY WITHIN THE PROPOSED BUDGET AMOUNT. AND THEN FINALLY JUST MORE GENERALLY -- WE JUST WE CONTINUE TO RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE ALLOCATE FUNDING TO ITS HIGHEST PRIORITIES. WHICH YOU KNOW COULD BE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION REDUCTIONS OTHER PRIORITIES WE KNOW ARE RELATED TO REDUCING LOCAL AIR POLLUTANTS CLIMATE ADAPTATION SO THINKING ABOUT WHAT THOSE HIGHEST PRIORITIES ARE. AND ONCE THOSE ARE IDENTIFIED TO THINKING ABOUT WHICH PROGRAMS ACHIEVE THOSE MOST EFFECTIVELY ON THE GREENHOUSE GAS SIDE WE'VE. BROUGHT A LOT OF COMMENTS IN THE PAST AND HOW TO THINK ABOUT THAT AND HOW SOME OF THE SPENDING INTERACTS WITH OTHER REGULATORY PROGRAM SO. IMPORTANT TO CONTINUE TO THINK ABOUT THAT -- ONE OTHER THING WE DO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT IT AGAIN ON THE GREENHOUSE GAS SIDE OF THINGS -- THINKING ABOUT. CALIFORNIA'S ROLE IN REDUCING GREENHOUSE GASES GLOBALLY AND GIVEN THAT RELIC CALIFORNIA IS A RELATIVELY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF GLOBAL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS THINK ABOUT -- WHICH PROGRAMS ARE LIKELY TO KIND OF PROMOTE EMISSION REDUCTION AND AND OTHER JURISDICTIONS AS WELL SO WHETHER THAT BE -- LOADING INNOVATION OR NEW TECHNOLOGIES THAT MAYBE COULD BE. ADOPTED ANOTHER TO OTHER JURISDICTIONS WHETHER THAT'S YOU KNOW DEMONSTRATING SOME PARTICULAR PROGRAM THAT MAYBE OTHER JURISDICTIONS ARE LIKELY TO ADOPT. THOSE ARE THOSE ARE DIFFICULT THINGS TO ANALYZE BUT WE DO THINK THEY'RE IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND WE'RE KIND OF CONSIDERING THE OVERALL PACKAGE OF DIFFERENT. STRATEGIES SO WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. CAN YOU I'M YEAH WE'VE GOT MOST OF US RECEIVE THIS ANNUAL REPORT FROM THE AIR RESOURCE BOARD INTO TALKING ABOUT THE APPROPRIATED FUNDS AND IN THE ALLOCATED FUNDS AND THEN THE SELECTED IN THE WARD. WERE DEFENSE IN THE IMPLEMENT IMPLEMENTED FUNDS SO WHILE WE MAY SIT HERE IN SUB TO AND SAY WE WANT. TO A LOT THIS MUCH MONEY. DOESN'T ACTUALLY GET SPEND IN THE THE REPORT SUGGESTS THAT THERE'S QUITE A BIT OF MONEY THAT. I GUESS WE SAY IN THE PIPELINE SO WELL WE WANT TO BE CAUTIOUS AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT THAT-THAT CONCERN AND WE MAY WANT TO PUT IN LANGUAGE THAT ALLOWS. FINANCE TO PUT ON THE BRAKES. JUST DISAPPEARS THE MEAN JUST ON THE NATURAL THAT. WE WOULD KNOW THE RESULTS OF AUCTIONS IF WE OVER ANTICIPATED OR OVER PROJECTED WELL BEFORE ANYBODY'S WRITING CHECKS MY WRONG ON THIS -- I MEAN I I THINK FOR THE ALLOCATIONS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN MADE THEN YEAH THERE THERE IS OFTEN TIMES SORT OF A DELAY IN. GETTING THAT FINDING OUT THE DOOR AND SOME OF THE PROGRAMS PARTICULARLY NEW ONES TAKES AWHILE TO GET MONEY OUT THE DOOR -- THE AUCTION RESULTS ARE TYPICALLY AVAILABLE ABOUT A WEEK AFTER THE AUCTION IS ACTUALLY HELD AND SO YEAH I KNOW THEIR APARTMENT A FINANCE REVIEWS THOSE ESTIMATES ARE OFFICE REVIEWS THOSE ESTIMATES AND OTHER THERE IS A TIME I'M SURE YOU AND AND MANY OTHERS REVIEW THOSE ESTIMATES AND SO. PART OF IT CAN BE KIND OF A CONVERSATION I THINK BETWEEN BETWEEN THE LEGISLATURE AND THE ADMINISTRATION. DOING TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW THAT THAT THAT -- WHATEVER LANGUAGE IS KIND OF IN THE BILL DOESN'T. NECESSARILY GIVE TOO MUCH AUTHORITY OR IS IT OR MAKE SURE THAT IT IS ALWAYS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT THE LEGISLATURE'S PRIORITIES ARE I GUESS MY CONCERN IS THAT YOU KNOW WE THERE'S A THE WORLD HAS A DESIRE BUILT A DESIRE. TO BE MORE AMBITIOUS AND ALL ALL COUNTRIES IN ALL WAYS AND IF WE'RE CAUTIOUS ON THE SPENDING OF MONEY THAT WE HAVE AN AN AUCTION BECAUSE WE'RE PROJECTING. AGAIN I'VE. I'VE ONLY BEEN HERE FOR EIGHT YEARS AND EVERY TIME THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION MADE A BUDGET [inaudible] OUR PROPOSAL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FINANCE WAS VERY VERY MUCH LOW BALLED THE THE THE AUCTION I'VE. I'VE WHAT ALL THE OPTIONS PROJECTIONS TEND TO BE LOW BALL I'D I'D. I AGREE WITH YOUR ANALYSIS OF THE EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION THAT'S ADDITIONAL -- THERE THAT'S AVAILABLE. REQUIRED BY LAW IS IN AN AMBITIOUS WAY THERE'S I'M TRYING TO GET THAT RIGHT BALANCE OF LET'S GET THIS MONEY OUT AND WHETHER IT'S ANOTHER HUNDRED MILLION IN THE YOU KNOW -- CLEAN CAR PROGRAM CASSETTES OVER PRESCRIBED EVERY YEAR EVERY YEAR WE KNOW THERE ARE MORE PEOPLE THAT WANT TO BUY THOSE THOSE THINGS OR WHATEVER PROGRAM THAT WE HAVE THAT WILL REDUCE GREENHOUSE GASES. WILL RECEIVE THE ACTUAL BENEFIT IF THAT. ASIAN MARKETS DONE SO. DO YOU SEE THE THE STRUGGLE THAT I'M HAVING WITH WITH TRYING TO SAY BE CAUTIOUS BUT ALSO BE AMBITIOUS. ABSOLUTELY AND I'M NOT THAT'S CLEARLY A STRUGGLE IN AND I THINK WE DO THINK THAT THERE -- WILL LIKELY BEES -- SOME ADDITIONAL RESOURCES THAT -- THE LEGISLATURE COULD IF IT'S IF IT WANTS TO GET MONEY OUT TO DOLE OUT THE DOOR SOONER COULD POTENTIALLY ALLOCATED THIS YEAR WHILE STILL HAVE BEEN KIND OF TAKING A CAUTIOUS APPROACH AS WELL AND HAVING AN ADEQUATE FUND BALANCE BUT IT'S YOU KNOW THERE'S NO -- THERE'S NO MAGIC ANSWER I DON'T THINK I'M KIND OF HOW TO BALANCE THAT RISK OF OF INSURING THAT THERE'S FISCAL STABILITY BUT ALSO TRYING TO GET. MONEY OUT THE DOOR AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND SO THAT THAT'S JUST A MATTER OF OF RISK IN TRYING TO EVALUATE THAT. WHAT'S YOUR OPINION ON THE CURRENT -- PRICE OF THE ALLOWANCES BECAUSE I I SAW IN THE REPORT THAT CAR PUT OUT. THAT THEY WERE LOOKING AT A SEVENTY FIVE DOLLAR FOR TIME AND BUT HOW THE DAVE OF PHRASES. THE CARD HE WORKED WITH THE APPLICATION OF OF OF ALL THE PROGRAMS COMES OUT TO BE. ABOUT A SEVENTY FIVE DOLLAR PER TON. COSTS FOR WHETHER IT'S METHANE REDUCTIONS ARE PRESCRIBED BURNS WHATEVER WAS IN THE AUCTION IS NORTH OF FIFTEEN DOLLARS -- IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE'S A DISCONNECTION THERE HOW DOES THE LA -- REVIEW THAT. I MEAN I I THINK OUR GENERAL VIEW IS THAT YOU KNOW RELYING ON SORT OF THE PRICE GIVEN THROUGH ALLOWANCES IS -- LIGHT AND MANY CASES THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE WAY TO KIND OF ENCOURAGE THOSE REDUCTIONS IN SO RIGHT NOW AS YOU HIGHLIGHTED SOME OF THE PRICE AND THE CAP AND TRADE MARKET IS MUCH LOWER THAN SOME OF THE ESTIMATED. COST PER GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS -- THROUGH THE SPENDING SIDE OF THINGS AND SO WE WE DO THINK SORT OF RELYING ON THE PRICE SIGNAL GIVEN THROUGH THOSE ALLOWANCE PRICES IS MORE COST EFFECTIVE WAY GENERALLY TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. NOW WITH THAT SAID THAT THERE ARE CERTAINLY OTHER AREAS AND OTHER REASONS TO KIND OF SPEND MONEY ON DIFFERENT THINGS AND SOME OF THOSE. FOR EXAMPLE ARE YOU EVEN -- WITH AID YOU KNOW HIRE -- ALLOWANCE PRICE FOR EXAMPLE THERE MIGHT NOT BE SORT OF QUITE ENOUGH INNOVATION AND NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND IT DOESN'T QUITE SEND THAT SIGNAL AND SO THERE'S OTHER TYPES OF NO COMMENTS REFER TO THESE AS MARKET FAILURES WHERE YOU KNOW THAT THERE MIGHT BE A A STATE ROLLING KIND OF USING. FUNDS TO PROMOTE THOSE TYPES OF THINGS AND SO THAT'S ONE CONSIDERATION WHEN THINKING ABOUT SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS ARE THEY TARGETED AT THOSE TYPES OF OF BENEFITS AND I THINK ANOTHER -- ANOTHER ISSUE IS YOU KNOW A LOT OF THESE PROGRAMS I THINK ARE. AT LEAST PARTIALLY TARGETED LOCAL AIR POLLUTION AND SO ON THE GREENHOUSE GAS SIDE THEY MIGHT NOT BE AS SORT OF COST EFFECTIVE AS SOME OF THE OTHER APPROACHES BUT THE GOAL FOR SOME OF THEM IS TO ACHIEVE SOME OF THESE OTHER BENEFITS AND SO TRYING. TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE A GOOD HANDLE ON UNDERSTANDING AND INFORMATION ON THE DEGREE TO WHICH IT IS ACHIEVING SOME OF THOSE OTHER BENEFITS AS WELL AN SORT OF TRYING TO EVALUATE THAT AND WEIGH THAT AGAINST WHAT MIGHT BE. A DIFFERENCE IN COST COMPARED TO SOME OTHER POLICIES WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO FOLLOW YOUR ADVICE ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE EXPENDITURE PLAN IS ONLY SPENT ON NON COVERED ENTITIES VERSUS COVERED ENTITIES IN THE EARLY DAYS WE WERE. WE WERE WE WERE. AUCTIONING -- POLLUTION ALLOWANCES AT A LOW PRICE WE ARE GIVING OUT FREE ALLOWANCES ON TOP OF IT FOR IN OUR AMBITION TO SMOOTH THINGS OUT. AND AND THEN WE WERE ACTUALLY HELPING OUT COVERED ENTITIES WHO ARE ALREADY PARTICIPATING AND AND THE AUCTION WE DIDN'T SEGREGATE THAT WE SHOULD BE GIVING THESE. THESE PROCEEDS THERE IF YOU HAVE IF YOU HAVE AN OVER ALLOTMENT OF FREE ALLOWANCES ARE OUT THERE CURRENTLY AND IF YOU HAVE A CRISIS IT'S FIFTEEN DOLLARS. AND HOW WOULD. ONE THING HERE WE HEAR HIMSELF TO WE WANT TO SPEND THE MONEY I GET I GET THAT THAT'S WHAT WE DO BUT IF WE WANT TO CHANGE BEHAVIOR. IF IT ISN'T IT BETTER TO GET THAT SEVENTY FIVE DOLLAR PRICE CLOSER TO WHAT THE WHAT THE ALLOWANCE PRICES TO THAT THE COVERED ENTITIES WOULD BE CHOOSING. TO TO THE INVESTMENT RATHER THAN TO BUY THE ALLOWANCE OR GET THE FREE ALLOWANCE TO MY NOT. FOLLOWING YOU KNOW GIVEN THAT NOW WE HAVE A REPORT THAT THIS IS WHAT WE'RE SPENDING AGAIN SOME OF ITS VERY HIGH SOME OF IT'S SLOW BUT BUT THE BLENDED RATE. I MEAN I I THINK. V. OUR VIEW IS IS. I THINK -- CLEAR FOCUS SHOULD BE ON MAKING SURE THAT THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM KIND OF IN THE NUMBER OF ALLOWANCES THAT ARE ISSUED AND DISTRIBUTED. IS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT THE THE GOALS OF THE LEGISLATURE HAS LAID OUT AND WE THINK IT'S IT'S THAT'S DONE -- IF THAT'S DONE WELL THEN THE ALLOWANCE PRICES WILL KIND OF PROVIDE THAT TYPE OF SIGNAL THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT FOUR COVERED ENTITIES AND BUSINESSES AND HOUSEHOLDS TO MAKE THOSE REDUCTIONS THAT ARE THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE. AND SO -- YOU KNOW MAKING SURE THAT THAT THAT KIND OF THAT PROGRAM IS SET UP IN A WAY THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE LEGISLATURE'S GOALS IS IS VERY IMPORTANT AND THEN YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT HOW TO HOW TO HOW TO WRAP AROUND SOME OF THE THE EXPENDITURES AND OTHER POLICIES AROUND THAT -- IT IS KIND OF THE NEXT IMPORTANT STEP AS WELL SHE PASSES TO PRIORITIZE OUR FUNDING PROPOSALS AND LET AND LOOK AT THE OUTCOMES AND WE'VE ALWAYS. TALK ABOUT THE BIGGEST BANG FOR THE BUCK. BUT IF WE IF WE KNEW THAT COVERED ENTITIES WERE MAKING INVESTMENTS TO REDUCE THE POLLUTION RATHER THAN YOU KNOW WITH THE LAST REPORT WE GOT FROM THE AIRPORT WAS THAT PEOPLE ARE DRIVING MORE MILES. YOU KNOW THE POLLUTION IS ACTUALLY GOING UP AND THEN WE HAVE A FOREST FIRE INCIDENTS WHICH WHICH AREN'T EVEN CALCULATED IN OUR IN OUR COVERAGE. IT'S IT'S IT'S DIFFICULT ON A GOOD DAY IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S MORE DIFFICULT TO TRY TO PRIORITIZE BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE MARKET RATE WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO BE WORKING OUT THERE THIS IS. A SIXTY DOLLAR. DISTANCE RIGHT IF IT WERE CLOSER THAN IT WOULD BE A DIFFERENT TASK FOR US TO SAY. WE'RE GONNA PUTS MORE MONEY AND RESEARCHER MORSE MONEY IN THESE IN THESE OTHER AREAS. THAT WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO YOU KNOW REALLY GET TO ZERO CARBON I GUESS IS IT VERSUS JUST TRYING. TO TREAD WATER. FINANCE IF ANYTHING THERE. THIS IS A GOOD OVERVIEW MEMBERS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. IN LOOKING AT THE EXPENDITURE PLAN IN THE VARIOUS CATEGORIES. THERE'S NOTHING DEDICATED NERO OCEANS AND I'M JUST WONDERING IF THAT SON ANYBODY'S RADAR WE HAVE. PROGRAMS RELATED TO OCEAN ACIDIFICATION. CARBON SEQUESTRATION PRACTICES -- I GUESS MAYBE IT'S MORE OF A QUESTION FOR THE LEGISLATURE AND TARGETING SOME PRIORITIES BUT IT. HAS THE ADMINISTRATION -- FOR LA -- GIVEN ANY CONSIDERATION. TO BROADENING EXPENDITURE. PROGRAMS TO INCLUDE OCEANS. THANK YOU JULIANNE MOORE IS TO ME WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. IN THE EXPENDITURE PLAN THERE IS MONEY APPROPRIATED TO THE COASTAL COMMISSION AND THE BABY. COSTA COUNTY CDC. BAY CONSERVATION AND DEVELOPMENT. COMMISSION FOR COASTAL ADAPTATION PURPOSES THE STATE COASTAL CONSERVANCY IS HAS QUITE A BIT OF FUNDING THROUGH -- PROP. SIXTY EIGHT BUT AS FAR AS THE CAP AND TRADE PROCEEDS -- SO AS FAR AS THE OCEAN THE COASTLINE. WE ARE FUNDING [inaudible] RIGHT SO. I APPRECIATE THAT AND I KNOW THAT WE ARE FOR THE SUM OF OUR PROPOSITION FUNDING. COASTAL CONSERVANCY IS IS ONE OF THE RECIPIENTS -- THAT YOU MENTION I JUST THINK AS WE MOVE FORWARD TO HAVE A MORE HOLISTIC APPROACH IN AGAIN BEST INVESTMENTS TO ACHIEVE THE OBJECTIVES. OCEAN SHOULD BE PART OF IT. THAT'S MORE OF A COMMENT THAN A QUESTION THANKS [inaudible] EARN. THANK YOU FOR LETTING INDULGING ME JUST AT THE HIGH HIGH LEVEL -- BEYOND ANY PARTICULAR CATEGORY ONE TO SORT OF FOLLOW UP ON THE CHAIRS. POINT IN TERMS OF THE OVERALL PURPOSE IN STRATEGY BEHIND THAT THE PLAN BROUGHT FORWARD TO US AND AT THE DRIVING PIECES I DON'T THINK SHOULD BE COST EFFECTIVENESS ON A DOLLAR PER TON BASIS I THINK THAT'S THE THE WRONG STRATEGY FOR THIS TYPE OF CAPITAL -- WHERE? THE CARBON PRICES REALLY DRIVING THE COST EFFECTIVE REDUCTIONS BUT THIS GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND IS A PLACE TO ME TO BE PATH BREAKING IN CREATIVE SO. JUST BOTH FROM THE F. AND FROM FROM LA -- HOW DO YOU LOOK AT THE SORT OF [inaudible] INNOVATION. IN EFFICACY OR IS IT LIKE THAT THAT METRIC OF HOW MUCH ARE WE ACTUALLY. STIMULATING INNOVATION IN THIS STATE SO WE CAN SORT OF BE BIGGER THAN WE ARE MAYBE I JUST TRY TO GET A SENSE OF THAT MAYBE START WITH THE F. AND THEN COME UP TO LA -- IS THAT IS THAT METRIC A MEANINGFUL ONE TO YOU ALL THESE AT THE END NONE LOOKING FOR SORT OF THE THESIS HERE AT LEAST OF WHAT IS DRIVING YOUR STRATEGY. RIGHT THANK YOU SENATOR DOWNTURN -- THE ADMINISTRATION. FOR THE CAP AND TRADE FUNDS AND WE WOULD AGREE WE WANT TO LOOK AT A LOT OF THE CO BENEFITS. NOT JUST GHG EMISSION REDUCTION BUT SOME OF THE OTHER BENEFITS SOME OF THE POLLUTANT MATERIAL -- REDUCTIONS -- FUEL REDUCTION WHICH DOES THAT DOESN'T DIRECTLY. EIGHT TWO MAYBE. GHG REDUCTIONS BUT IF THE REFINERIES DON'T. NEED TO PRODUCE AS MUCH IN AN IN AN INDIRECT WAY IT WILL. SO THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS WE ALSO ARE -- MEETING A LOT OF THE FUNDING IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES LOW INCOME YOU LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. SO THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT -- NOT CRITERIA BUT A LOT OF DIFFERENT POINTS OF VALUE. TO HOW THE FUNDS ARE ALLOCATED AND IF I MAY I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT AT A HIGH LEVEL WHAT THE ANNUAL REPORT. WILL POINT OUT CORRECT THAT WAS THAT WAS RELEASED EARLIER THIS WEEK. THAT NINE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS HAS BEEN -- APPROPRIATED IN FUNDING FOR PROJECTS THAT FACILITATE THE GHG REDUCTIONS. AND SUPPORT A VARIETY OF STATE PRIORITIES. SO THOSE INCLUDE LOW CARBON TRANSPORTATION WILDFIRE PREVENTION. JOBS. COMMUNITY AIR PROTECTION AND CLIMATE RESILIENCY. ADMINISTERING AGENCIES HAVE IMPLEMENTED THREE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS TO CARRY OUT AN ESTIMATED THIRTY SIX POINT FIVE MILLION TONS OF GHG EMISSIONS REDUCTION. AND THAT IS JUST THE G. H. T. ASIDE FROM ALL OF THE OTHER CO BENEFITS -- THE INVESTMENTS ARE HELPING PRIORITY POPULATIONS WHICH WE IDENTIFIED AS DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. 57% OF THE IMPLEMENTED FAN FUNDING HAS BENEFITED THE PRIORITY POPULATIONS WITH 36% OF THE IMPLEMENTED FUNDING LOCATED WITHIN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. SO WE ARE BEGINNING TO TARGET. A LOT OF THE INVENTOR WELL THE INVESTMENTS HAVE MET AND EXCEEDED. THE INVESTMENTS MINIMUMS THAT HAVE BEEN SET FORTH IN. AB FIFTEEN FIFTY AN SP. FIVE THIRTY FIVE THE REPORT ALSO INCLUDES STATISTICS. FROM THE GROWING INFORMATION ON THE KOBE AND IF IT'S THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT. THE ANNUAL REPORT ALSO PROVIDES OUTCOMES. FROM THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN PROJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED. SO FOR EXAMPLE OUT OF THE HUNDRED NINETY SEVEN MILLION APPROPRIATED FOR THE AGRICULTURE REPLACEMENTS. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN SIXTY SIX POINT THREE MILLION HAS BEEN A WAR WELL. THIRTEEN POINT TWO MILLION HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED. WITH TEN THOUSAND METRIC TONS OF GHG EMISSION REDUCTIONS ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION POUNDS OF KNOX REDUCTIONS. OVER NINETY NINE THOUSAND POUNDS OF DIESEL PM TWO POINT FIVE REDUCTIONS AND ALMOST A HUNDRED GALLONS AND FUEL REDUCTION. 73% OF THE FUNDS WERE IN DISADVANTAGED AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND HOUSEHOLDS. THE AB SIX SEVENTEEN COMMUNITY AIR PROTECTION PROGRAM. OUT OF THE FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN MILLION ALLOCATED HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN POINT FOUR MILLION IMPLEMENTED IN. TWENTY EIGHTEEN RESULTS IN SIXTY FOUR THOUSAND METRIC TONS OF GHG EMISSION REDUCTIONS. TWELVE POINT THREE MILLION GALLONS IN FUEL REDUCTION. NINE POINT SEVEN MILLION POUNDS OF KNOX REDUCTIONS. AND ALMOST FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND POUNDS OF DIESEL PARTICULATE MATTER. REDUCTIONS. SO. SO THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT EXACTLY THERE ARE A LOT OF TABLES IN THERE AND THEY ALL SHOW DIFFERENT -- THAT WE CAN LOOK AT THINGS. AND AND IT IS A MATTER OF BALANCING. OUT ALL OF THE DIFFERENT. BENEFITS NOT JUST GHG BUT BENEFITS TO THE COMMUNITIES BENEFITS YOU KNOW RECOGNIZING SOME OF THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES ARE HIT HARDER. AND WE WANT TO ADDRESS A LOT OF THE THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ISSUES AS WELL AND WE'RE USING THIS AS A MECHANISM TO DO THAT. TO THE TUNE OF 57%. MISTER BROWN YOU HAVE SOMETHING THAT. YEAH I MEAN I I THINK. IT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION AND AND AND FROM OUR VIEW IS SORT OF A VERY REASONABLE WAY TO KIND OF THINK ABOUT YOU KNOW POTENTIALLY PRIORITIZING FUNDS AROUND YOU KNOW TO ACHIEVE IN THE THE BIGGEST IMPACT ON GREENHOUSE GASES SORT OF THINKING ABOUT YOU KNOW HOW TO PROMOTE INNOVATION. HERE TO YOUR QUESTION ABOUT KIND OF HOW TO HOW TO DO THAT. I THINK THE CHALLENGES YOU KNOW INNOVATION IS I THINK AN INHERENTLY A VERY DIFFICULT THING TO QUANTIFY. AND TRYING TO THINK THROUGH WHAT IS THE STATE'S ROLE IN KIND OF THE PROMOTING THAT INNOVATION PARTICULARLY AMONG SORT OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR WHETHER THAT BE KIND OF EARLY. STAGE RESEARCH OR SOMETHING KIND OF FURTHER DOWN THE LINE MAYBE PILOTS AND DEMONSTRATIONS PROTOTYPES OR JUST KIND OF THE NEAR DEPLOYMENT OF KIND OF NEWER TECHNOLOGIES COMMERCIALLY -- I DON'T KNOW THAT WE HAVE SORT OF A GREAT ANSWER ON KIND OF WHERE EXACTLY. IN THAT KIND OF PIPELINE THE THAT THE STATE CAN KIND OF BEST SPEND ITS RESOURCES I KNOW YOU KNOW -- YOUR SENATE OFFICE OF RESEARCH HAS RECENTLY DONE QUITE A BIT OF WORK ON THIS -- WE DEFINITELY THINK IT'S KIND OF THE THE RIGHT TYPE OF QUESTION TO BE KIND OF ASKING AND AND THINKING ABOUT -- ON KIND OF HOW TO USE THIS MONEY TO KIND OF PROMOTE THAT TYPE OF INNOVATION AND WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK LOOK. INTO KINDA TRYING TO EVALUATE THAT AS MUCH AS WE CAN BUT I DO THINK IT'S KIND OF AN INHERENTLY VERY DIFFICULT THING. YOU MISSED RENT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WOULD JUST I WOULD ASK I KNOW YOU'RE BOUNCING A LOT OF PRIORITIES IN COMMUNITIES AND INJUSTICES AND ALL THE ALL THE THE VARIETY OF THINGS WE ASK YOU DO AS A LEGISLATURE BOTH IN. TRAILER LANGUAGE OVER TIME REPORTING PROTOCOLS ETCETERA BUT I WOULD LOVE THE CREATIVE THINKING OF THIS ADMINISTRATION TO HELP US SORT OF THINK THROUGH. HOW DO WE PUNCH BEYOND OUR UP ABOVE OUR WAIT HERE FROM INNOVATION PERSPECTIVE HOW DO WE ACTUALLY SHOW THAT WE'RE WE'RE MAKING GAME CHANGING -- IN ADVANCEMENTS IN OUR IN OUR APPROACH TO GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS NOT JUST OF BUYING DOWN THE LOWEST CONCEPT FOR SPREADING IT OUT TO ALL THE VARIOUS POLITICAL CONSTITUENCIES THAT CARE ABOUT THIS MONEY LIKE. DOING SOMETHING THAT'S A LITTLE A LITTLE BOLDER AND A LITTLE FARTHER REACHING. IF YOU IF YOU CAN START TO THINK ABOUT THAT THE FACT THAT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ISN'T EVEN IN HERE AND WAS WAS TAKEN DOWN AND I DON'T KNOW IF AGAIN MAYBE THAT'S NOT THE RIGHT INTERVENTION POINT. BUT UNDERLYING THAT I DON'T WANT TO CONCEDE THAT INVESTING IN INNOVATION IS IGNORING INJUSTICE. THE GREATEST THING YOU CAN DO FOR EQUITY IS BRING DOWN THE COST OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES AND DELIVER THEM THESE COMMUNITIES WHO NEED THEM AND SO IT'S A LONGER VIEW BUT ANYWAY -- JUST SUBMITTED FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. ZUNI IN CENTER STERN WE SHOULD REMIND OURSELVES THIS IS A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE SENATE AND THE ADMINISTRATION AND WE TOGETHER WILL BE DEVELOPING OUR EXPENDITURE PLAN FOR ON THE DISCRETIONARY -- FUNDS THAT ARE RESULTS FROM AGREED UPON -- NUMBER FOR A GREENHOUSE GASES MISS MARS NESN AND I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT WHILE IT MIGHT NOT BE CALLED OUT. SPECIFICALLY IN SOME OF THESE -- HE SAYS. THERE ARE DEMONSTRATION PILOTS -- DEMONSTRATION PROGRAMS I MEAN AND PILOTS AND OTHER. FORMS OF TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH AND AND VERIFYING. AND I CAN'T GET INTO THE DETAILS I WOULD NEED I WOULD NEED THE DEPARTMENTS TO PROVIDE. THAT DETAIL BUT I WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE DOES NEED TO BE ADVANCEMENTS IN THE TECHNOLOGY FIELD. AND IT'S IT'S CUTTING EDGE ALL THE TIME THAT'S THAT'S WHERE WE'RE GOING. AND WITH THAT. OVERVIEW LET'S TURN THE ISSUE NUMBER ONE THIS IS THE ACTUAL -- GREENHOUSE GAS [inaudible] REDUCTION FUND [inaudible] YOUR MATH. PAGER SIX OF OUR OUTLINE. ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE HAS SOME ACQUIRE. INTERESTING COMMENTS YES. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR. I'D LIKE TO BE A HIGHLIGHT. US. THE ISSUES ON AGRICULTURE IF IT WORKS FOR THE CHAIR YES -- IN WE'LL HAVE TO SEE A FEW OTHER COMMENTS LATER ON FIVE ONE TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY THANK YOU TO DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THE GOVERNOR -- FOR A VAN SEEN OTHER PROPOSALS AND I JUST GO THROUGH SOME OF THE CONCERNS -- THAT I HAVE IN A SPECIAL WE'RE TAKING A LOOK AT CALIFORNIA. AN UNDERSTANDING WITH THE GOVERNOR WANTS TO BE THE FOCUS IS ON RURAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. WHETHER IT'S IN THE VALLEY ON THE NORTH COAST OF THE NORTH ST. MAKING SURE THAT. RULE CLIFORNIA THE SAME ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES WITH THE THRIVE IS URBAN. AND I THINK WE ALL CAN AGREE THAT INSURING THAT. SHE SHE REDUCTIONS IN WHATEVER THAT DATA POINT IS. NEEDS A GUIDE INVESTMENT. THEY WERE I HAVE SOME CONCERN. IS ON THE AGRICULTURAL DIESEL ENGINE REPLACEMENT REDUCTION GOING FROM. A HUNDRED AND TWELVE MILLION IN THE CURRENT FISCAL. TO TWENTY FIVE I THINK REDUCTIONS FROM DERRY GOING FROM -- NINETY NINE TO TWENTY FIVE AS WELL AS THE INCENTIVES FOR FOOD PROCESSORS [inaudible] SO -- ACCORDING TO BOAST DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AS WELL AS LA -- ANALYSIS. PROVING THE GREATEST GIGI REDUCTION FOR ALL FUNDED PROGRAMS IN THE SECOND MOST COST EFFECTIVE IS FOCUSING ON THEORIES AND NOTHING. SO THERE IS A DEAL THAT WAS STRUCK ONE SP THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE WAS ORIGINALLY PASSED BY THE LEGISLATURE SENATOR LARA. FOCUSING ON METHANE REDUCTION FOR CALIFORNIA'S DAIRIES. THERE IS DEEP CONCERN OF CALIFORNIA'S JERRY COMMUNITY ABOUT. THE ADDITIONAL COST BURDEN THAT THEY MAY HAVE. AS WE'RE SEEN NO PLATE PRICES ACROSS THIS NATION FLATTEN AND OR BE REDUCED [inaudible] AND THE GOVERNOR AT THE TIME. ADVANCED. TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO BE ABLE TO INVEST TO ASSIST DAIRIES. BE ABLE TO HIT THE NEW LAW THAT THEY'RE REQUIRED. ABOUT 8% OF OUR TOTAL JG PACKAGE IN THE STATE A PERSON OF THE MISSIONS ARE COMING FROM WHEN YOU WERE IN CALIFORNIA. IT'S ONE OF THE FEW TIMES YOU CAN EVER USE THAT WORD IN BUDGET COMMITTEE SO -- THANK YOU -- SO. IF ANYONE'S PLAYING BINGO -- SO HERE'S WHAT I'LL SAY WE'VE HAD. HUNDREDS OF DERRY FAMILIES. MADE INVESTMENTS ACROSS THE STATE. KNOWING THAT THERE IS GOING TO BE A FOCUS ON REDUCING REDUCING METHANE. EMISSIONS FROM IN YOUR A BILLION DOLLARS IS CURRENTLY ON THE MOVE RIGHT NOW ON REDUCING THEIR G. SHE FOOT PRINT OUT OF THAT BILLION DOLLARS TWO HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION APPROXIMATE IS COMING. UP FROM THE STATE IN PUBLIC GRANTS REMAINDERS GOING FROM A IS COMING FROM HARD WORKING MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE IN THE DAIRY INDUSTRY. AND NOW WE'RE AT THERE IS A PROPOSAL TO BE A CUT WHAT IS. IT. PROVING TO BE THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE REDUCTION OF GHGS IN CALIFORNIA. UNDER A USE THE EXAMPLE IN THE NORTH COAST NOW. RIGHT NOW -- THERE HAVE BEEN MULTIPLE MEETINGS WITH DAIRY OWNERS TO BE ABLE TO GET THEM ENROLLED IN THE PROGRAM. VIA SP. THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE TWO YEARS AGO THERE THREE APPLICATIONS WHEN IT COMES FOR NEWER MANAGEMENT THIS YEAR THERE ARE. EIGHT JUST ON THE NORTH COAST. MOSTLY SMALL FAMILY FARMERS THREE HUNDRED HEADER CAL OR LESS. NOW WHEN IT COMES TO DIGEST RESEARCH TWELVE APPLICANTS THIS YEAR FIVE OR SIX TO PREVIOUS. I SAY ALL THIS IS IF WE ARE SERIOUS ABOUT FOCUSING ON ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN RURAL CALIFORNIA WE HAVE TO BE SERIOUS ABOUT AGRICULTURE. ON THE NORTH COAST WE HAVE JUST TAKEN A HUGE HIT BY THE SEVERE CUT IN THE DUNGEONS CRAB SEASON THAT USED TO GO FROM NOVEMBER ALL THE WAY TO JULY. IN A COURT SETTLEMENT THAT IS NOT GONNA BE CUT OFF TO APRIL. AT LEAST ON THE NORTH COAST. THAT IS ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC DRIVERS THAT RULE COASTAL COMMUNITIES HAVE THAT HAVE THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF POVERTY. WHAT'S LEFT IS A SMALL AMOUNT OF TIMBER [inaudible] VERY [inaudible] IN MARIJUANA. SO WHAT WE KNOWIS. AT A LOSS FOR ECONOMIC DRIVERS. WE ARE SEEN RECORD NUMBERS OF INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE FARM CANNABIS FOR YEARS. UNABLE TO ACHIEVE THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROGRAM THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE THE A PROP. SIXTY FOUR NUMBER TWO WERE SEEN A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN THE SEASON FOUR ROLE CALIFORNIANS IN REGARDS TO CRAP. THREE WHEN IT COMES THE DAIRY WE HAVE TOLD EVERYONE YOU HAVE TO COMPLY WITH THE LAW. WE PROVIDED THEM INCENTIVES TO BE ALE TO MOVE FORWARD ON INVESTING IN DOING THE RIGHT THING REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND NOW WE'RE ABOUT TO TAKE IT BACK. IN EVERYTHING I HEAR FROM THIS LEGISLATURE AS WELL AS THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND RIGHTFULLY SO WE ARE ABOUT CREATING EQUITY IN EVERY CORNER OF THE STATE. SO FOR SERIOUS ABOUT GREEN EQUITY WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. AND THIS IS GOING TO BE A HUGE HIT PEROT CALIFORNIA IF WE'RE GOING TO YANK THE CARPET. UNDER FROM UNDERNEATH THESE DAIRY FARMERS FOR DOING THE RIGHT THING. BUT YET CAN'T ACCOMPLISH WITH INCENTIVE SO I'M IN INDEED THERE AND I JUST WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE. TO GET SOME TO SEE IF WE CAN HAVE SOME DISCUSSION ESPECIALLY KNOWING THAT IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO BE ABLE -- TO REDUCE GHGS AND THE THIRD MOST EFFECTIVE WHEN IT COMES TO THE PRICE [inaudible] FOR TEN MISS. MORE -- ZOOMING I BELIEVE THAT ONE OF THE CHARTS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT OUTCOMES THAT SENATORS REFERRING TO IS THAT. THE COST PER GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS IN DOLLARS PER METRIC TON FOR THE DERRY DIGEST IS IS THAT NINE DOLLARS -- AND THE THE ALTERNATIVE NEWER MANAGEMENT IS IT FORTY THREE DOLLARS WE'RE TRYING TO LOOK. ESSENCE OF HIS. QUESTION DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT RESPONSE. THERE'S A LOT THERE. WE'RE STILL TRYING TO GO OVER ALL OF THE NUMBERS AND AND GET SOME AMOUNT OF FRAMEWORK MOVING FORWARD IF WE'RE GOING TO BABYSIT. AGAIN ON THE COST OF THE MOST BANG FOR OUR BUCK -- BUT AGAIN IT'S SOMETHING THAT WERE IN THE PROCESS OF REVIEWING. AND AS IS HAS DONE IN THE PAST WE REVIEW ALL OF THE G. P. AS FAR AS THE AUCTION PROCEEDS. BEYOND WHAT MAY BE AVAILABLE WILL BE DOING THAT THROUGH THE MAY REVISE PROCESS -- AND ACKNOWLEDGING YOUR POINT I WOULD NEED TO GET WITH I WOULD NEED TO HAVE THE CDFA. HI I WAS A HOME OF THE TWO PIECES BASED OFF OF THE INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS. FROM THE HERE'S WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT. THE DERRY DIGESTED PROGRAMS THE STATE'S MOST EFFECTIVE REDUCTION WHEN IT COMES A CO. TWO AND THE THIRD MOST EFFECTIVE CLIMATE PROGRAM OUT OF THE FORTY EIGHT THEY'RE CURRENTLY BEING FUNDED [inaudible] I'M. AND IT'S BASED OFF OF THE FORMULA THAT AT THE CHURCH HE SAID SO I'M JUST REACTING TO WHAT IS CURRENTLY WITHIN THE BUDGET THAT YOU'RE PROPOSING. IN ALL I'M SAYING I PROMISE ALL OF STOPPED AND I JUST WANNA TELL YOU HOW GRATEFUL I AM FOR YOUR WORK AND THIS IS NOT PERSONAL WHEN IT COMES TO YOU SO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE. BUT AT ALL -- AND I JUST WANT TO SHARE THE FRUSTRATION FOR BASING OUR DECISIONS OFF OF DATA. AND IT SHOULD BE NEAR THE TOP. I THINK ANOTHER FOR ANOTHER PIECE THAT WE LOOK AT AND IT'S ALSO INCLUDE. SOMEWHAT IN THE IN THE REPORT. IS. LEV USING SOME OF THE THE CAP AND TRADE PROCEEDS. TO LEVERAGE OTHER FUNDING SOURCES AS WELL SO WHILE IT MAY LOOK LIKE IT'S A REDUCTION OVERALL TO THE PROGRAM. AND THAT'S WHY I NEED TO GET ALL OF THE PIECES TOGETHER -- IT'S NOT NECESSARILY A REDUCTION IT MAY BE A REDUCTION IN GHG I MEAN. GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND BUT THERE ARE OTHER FUNDS THAT ARE THAT ARE ALSO SUPPORTING. THAT. EIGHT IF THAT IS THE CASE WOULD LOVE TO HEAR IT IN JUST BEING HONEST ABOUT IT. I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S THE CASE -- AND IT'S THURSDAY BE IT ISN'T IN EVERY CASE IT ISN'T ON EVERY. PROGRAM THAT HAS SEEN SOME REDUCTIONS BUT FOR EXAMPLE THE SWEET PROGRAM. DID I MEAN THEY FOUND OTHER FUNDING SOURCES SO THEY ARE FULLY FUNDED A SOUGHT APART FROM. D. G. R. F.. SO AND THAT'S THAT'S ONE OF THE BENEFITS I THINK IN SOME OF OUR PLANNING. IS WE START THESE PROGRAMS WITH THE IDEA THAT. YOU KNOW WHEN IT ONCE IT GETS ROLLING AND EVERYBODY ELSE SEES THE BENEFITS THAN. OTHER FUNDING SOURCES BECOME AVAILABLE. AND I AM PLEASE SIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ENOUGH RESPOND THE SECOND MORNING JUMPED PATRICK DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. I'M NOT SURE WHICH REPRESENTATIVES WE HAVE HERE TODAY FROM THE DEPARTMENT -- BUT I WOULD LIKE TO ADD TO THE CONVERSATION. THAT OVER THE YEARS A NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS IN APPROPRIATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE AS YOU WELL KNOW FOR ALL OF THESE PROGRAMS. GIVEN THE MULTI YEAR VALIDITY OF THE DOLLARS AND THE OPERATIONAL SORT OF CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH WORKING WITH. DIFFERENT POTS OF MONEY FROM DIFFERENT YEARS AS THEY GET CO MINGLED IS IS IN SOME CASES. AN OPERATIONAL CHALLENGE FOR DEPARTMENTS TO GET ALL OF THE MONEY OUT THE DOOR PROJECTS ARE STARTED PROJECTS SOMETIMES ARE CANCELED UNEXPECTEDLY. SO -- PART OF THIS DISCUSSION I THINK IT WOULD BE -- USEFUL TO KNOW TO WHAT EXTENT WHEN THERE IS OVERLAP FOR EXAMPLE -- CDFA RECEIVED A VERY LARGE POT OF MONEY FOR DEAR DAIRY EFFORTS LAST YEAR -- AND SO AS IT RELATES TO HOW MUCH THEY CAN MANAGE SORT OF A A CASH FLOW BASIS IF YOU WILL IT I THINK IT WARRANTS. JUST TO BE FAIR ABOUT THAT THIS THIS PROGRAM'S OVERSUBSCRIBED. SO THERE ARE MORE APPLICATIONS.FOR THE MONEY THEN THERE IS MONEY ALREADY IT'S AN OVERSUBSCRIBED PROGRAM IN IN THIS PROGRAM IS ONLY TWO YEARS OLD. SO -- IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO THINK. A COMPLICATED MULTI BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY IS GOING TO BE A TURN ON A DIME IN EVEN GET THE STRUCTURE IS IMPLEMENTED IN THE SYSTEMS IMPLEMENTED TO BE AT A REDUCED THEIR G. SHE'S. TWENTY FOUR MONTHS. THIS IS WHEN THE BILL WAS PASSED SO. AND THE FACTS ARE THE PROGRAM IS WAY OVER SUBSCRIBED IN REGARDS TO THE NUMBER OF PROJECTS THAT FOLKS ONE IMPLEMENT AND THE DOLLARS -- THAT ARE AVAILABLE AND THIS IS BASED OFF OF THE NINETY NINE MILLION LAST YEAR. SO -- I WOULD LOVE TO BE A HAVE A FURTHER CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS BECAUSE IT'S A IT'S OF GREAT CONCERN. MYSTERONS BROWN TO ME. YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD. ALL RIGHT. ABSOLUTELY AND THE ADMINISTRATION LOOKS FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE. I'M GONNA HOLD PUBLIC COMMENT UNTIL AFTER WE GET. TO THE NEXT ITEM LET'S MOVE ON TO EACH OF CENTER CENTER STERN I APOLOGIZE. I THANK MISTER -- WHAT IT IS SEE WHAT LA -- INDIO F.. THOUGHT ABOUT A DIFFERENT WAY TO HANDLE. THE WAY WE'RE FINDING SORT OF OUR RESILIENCY WRIT LARGE. AND SPECIFICALLY -- THE THE RISKS WE'RE SEEING NOW -- AROUND WILDFIRE LIABILITY TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IN OUR CONTINUES APPROPRIATIONS ARE RELEGATED TO SORT OF TANSIT AND THOSE ARE LONG TERM. OPERATIONS OF HIGH SPEED RAIL. AND YOU KNOW ONE ITEM FOR CONSIDERATION FOR THE FUTURE IS. WE'VE BEEN WE'VE BEEN. I'D SAY GENEROUS AND AND APPROPRIATELY SO WITH OUR SPENDING AROUND -- FIRED -- BOTH THEIR RISK MITIGATION AS WELL AS SOME SUPPRESSION EFFORTS BUT ESPECIALLY ON THE MITIGATE ON ON THE RISK MITIGATION SIDE. I'M I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IF WE SENT A SIGNAL. OUT TO THE MARKETS THAT CALIFORNIA WAS COMMITTED ON A LONG TERM BASIS THE PUTTING. HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS IF NOT BILLIONS OVER A PERIOD OF TIME INVESTED DIRECTLY AND RESILIENCY IN REDUCING WILD. RISK HOW THAT MIGHT MAKE OUR STATES OF FISCAL ARRANGEMENT ESPECIALLY ON THE UTILITY SIDE. WHAT IT ACTUALLY MIGHT DO TO BUY DOWN SOME OF THAT RISK FROM? NOT FROM A RATE BASE BUT FROM IN SOME WAYS. THE ORIGINAL COST CAUSATION WHICH IS OUR CARBON POLLUTION RIGHT I MEAN THE ORIGINAL THE THE THE THOSE PAYING HERE. IF YOU LOOK ATTHE OUR PRIMARY MISSIONS OF THE PETROLEUM SIDE SO RIGHT NOW WE'RE TRYING TO BASICALLY BOUNCE THE ENTIRE BURDEN OF CLIMATE. ON THE UTILITY SECTOR SORT OF WITHIN THAT SILO BUT I THINK THERE'S A SORT OF HEALTHY ARGUMENT TO BE HAD -- FOR TRYING TO FIND SOME OTHER WAY NOT NECESSARILY DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE RATE PAYER APPROPRIATE TYPE FUNDING THAT REALLY SHOULDN'T BE IN THIS SPOT BUT IF YOU GO BEYOND THE LINE. ARE YOU GO BEYOND THAT SORT OF BASIC HARDENING AND YOU SORT OF START TO ZOOM OUT A LITTLE MORE WHAT'S GOING TO ACTUALLY MAKE THIS STATE SURVIVABLE. IN THE NEXT DECADE IT'S GONNA TAKE A VARIETY OF THINGS THAT AREN'T NECESSARILY IN SAY THE NINE OH ONE MITIGATION -- WILDFIRE PLANS. SO I SAID I WANTED TO GET YOUR TAKE ON ON THAT THAT CONCEPT AND DOESN'T HAVE TO BE TODAY. BUT IS THAT. IS THE IS THERE IS THERE EFFICACY TO THIS STRATEGY IS SORT OF THINKING ABOUT THIS IN A LONGER TERM WAY RIGHT AS OPPOSED TO AN ANNUAL OKAY THIS YEAR WE WE CARE ABOUT FIRE OKAY NEXT YEAR. WE DON'T KNOW WE CARE ABOUT CLIMATE RISK I MEAN I I DON'T WANT TO JUST RELEGATED AGAIN TO FIRE RIGHT BECAUSE WE'RE VULNERABLE BOTH ON SEALEVEL RISE WERE VULNERABLE ON ON FLOODS THERE'S A LOT OF COSTS. THEY WERE FACING -- BETWEEN NOW AND SAY ARE TWENTY THIRTY GOALS SO JUST A A BRIEF THAT TAKE ON THAT IF YOU HAVE ONE EITHER LA OR DEAL WITH AND NOT. IT WOULD HELP WAS WRITTEN THERE. YOU CAN JUMP INTO THE AREA DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I THINK THE POINT THAT YOU'RE TAKING IS VERY WELL RECEIVED AND WE OF COURSE DO YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THESE. EXPENDITURES IN A LONG TERM WAY SO NO NOT NECESSARILY ANY IMMEDIATE REACTIONS TO YOUR COMMENT BUT YEAH I MEAN I THINK IT'S A A BIG AND IMPORTANT QUESTION AND I DON'T HAVE ANY SO. I DON'T THINK GREAT ANSWERS AT THIS POINT -- WELL I MEAN ONE THOUGHT THAT COMES TO MIND IS -- YOU KNOW IT PART OF THE STRUGGLE I THINK IT'S KIND OF THINKING THROUGH AGAIN KINDA KNOW WHAT THE THE ROLE OF SORTS STATE FUNDING IS FOR SOME OF THESE ACTIVITIES AND ALSO SORT OF TRYING TO AND MAINTAIN SORT OF INCENTIVES FOR OTHER ACTORS PRIVATE PARTIES ARE OTHER ACTORS. MAKING SURE THAT YOU KNOW ALL THE ALL THE ACTORS THAT HAVE SORT OF A AN OPPORTUNITY TO REDUCE THE MAGNITUDE OF THAT RISK GOING FORWARD CAN CONTINUE TO HAVE THOSE INSURGENTS ARE TRYING TO IN SOME CASES IT. CERTAINLY WILL BE SORT OF THAT YOU KNOW POTENTIALLY STATE ROLE FOR THAT IN OTHER CASES YOU MAYBE NOT THOSE ARE SORT OF TRYING TO THINK THROUGH KIND OF HOW THE STATE RESOURCES CAN BE TARGETED. TO TO TO REDUCE THAT RISK BUT ALSO SORT OF MAINTAIN THOSE SIGNALS AND SO -- THOSE ARE THOSE ARE LIKE I THINK TO SOME HIGH LEVEL COMMENTS BUT CERTAINLY SOMETHING WE WILL CONTINUE TO THINK ABOUT. CLOSE ISSUE NUMBER ONE ONE OF OUR MEMBERS HAS TO LEAVE SO BEFORE WE GET TO ISSUE NUMBER TWO I WOULD LIKE TO GO BACK TO THE VOTE ONLY CALENDAR -- OUR FIRST FOR YOURSELF MISTER CORN PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

MISTER CHAIR THIS IF I MAY -- I'VE GOT -- DISTRICT RESPONSIBILITIES THIS AFTERNOON SO I MAY NOT BE ABLE TO STAY FOR THE ENTIRE PRESENTATION OF THIS -- BECAUSE I MAKE A MOTION -- NO I THINK GIVEN THE FACT IF YOU YOU HAVE TO LEAVE -- I KNOW WE HAVE A STAFF RECOMMENDATION WILL PROBABLY JUST HOLD THE MATTER OPEN OKAY I LOVE IT THAT'S APPRECIATE YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES YOU HAVE OUTSIDE OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE. THANK YOU [inaudible] PLEASE PROCEED. SENATOR WHY CASKEY OF MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH MY NAME IS TIM RAINY I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD. WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A FEW COMMENTS. ABOUT THE ITEM. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE OUR CLIMATE GOALS WE NEED THE WORKERS TO DO IT. CALIFORNIA'S AMBITIOUS CLIMATE GOALS ARE TRANSFORMING THE ECONOMY IN A TRANSFORMING ECONOMY WE NEED TO TRANSFORM THE WORK FORCE TO DO THIS. WE NEED TO LOOK AT EQUITY -- INTO ACHIEVE ACCURATE EQUITY WE QUALITY. A CLEAN GREEN ECONOMY THAT LIFTS ALL BOATS -- WON'T HAPPEN ACCIDENTALLY THE CITY CALIFORNIA MUST BE DELIVERED ABOUT THAT. CALIFORNIA ALONE AS WAS MENTIONED BEFORE -- WILL NOT. IN CLIMATE CHANGE -- BUT WE ARE A MODEL TO SHOW THE WAY -- AND I THINK WE ARE SHOWING NOT JUST THE COUNTRY THE WAY BUT BUT INTERNATIONALLY CALIFORNIA IS IS CHARTING THE COURSE TOWARD A CLEAN GREEN ECONOMY. WE HAVE A COUPLE OF GREAT MODELS OF THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD IS CORE TO OUR EQUITY CLIMATE IN JOBS WORK. THEY'RE NOT HUGE PROJECTS OR DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS -- COMPARED TO CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY BUT WE THINK THEY SHOW THE WAY THE GREAT MODELS. THE FIRST ONE IS CALLED HIERO TRAINING PARTNERSHIPS WE'RE IN THE THIRD YEAR -- WITH EIGHT PARTNERSHIPS AROUND THE STATE. WE'RE WORKING IN TRANSIT HEALTHCARE BUILDING MAINTENANCE HOSPITALITY WATER WAREHOUSING PORTS AND OTHERS WE TRAINED OVER A THOUSAND WORKERS OVER THE PERIOD OF TIME IN THIS DEMONSTRATION GRANT. IN ALL THE PROJECTS WORKERS ARE AT THE TABLE WITH MANAGEMENT -- UNDERSTANDING HOW TO CO DESIGN IMPLEMENT PROGRAMS MAP OCCUPATIONAL CHANGE DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE. DUE TO THE INTRODUCTION OF TECHNOLOGY IN GENERAL INDUSTRY CHANGING IN TRANSITION. IN ALL CASES ARE WE'RE PARTNERING WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS WORK FORCE AGENCIES AND SCHOOLS AND THE FOCUS IS ON EQUITY AND DIVERSITY AND IMPROVING EQUITY AND AND AND DIVERSITY. AND MOVING PEOPLE UP -- AND MOVIE NEW PEOPLE IN AT THE ENTRY LEVEL. THE SECOND ONE IS CALLED HIGH ROAD CONSTRUCTION CAREERS. WE STARTED THIS WORK WITH PROP THIRTY NINE FUNDING A LITTLE WHILE AGO THE CLEAN ENERGY JOBS ACT. TO CREATE ACCESS TO STATE APPROVED CONSTRUCTION APPRENTICESHIP THROUGH MULTI CRAFT PRE APPRENTICESHIP PARTNERSHIPS -- USING A NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED MC THREE CURRICULUM MULTI CRAFT CORE CURRICULUM. OVER THE LAST FORTY FIVE YEARS. WE'VE INVESTED IN BUILDING TWELVE PARTNERSHIPS ACROSS THE STATE WE INTEND. TO EXPAND THAT TO FOURTEEN ONE IN EVERY EACH OF THE FOURTEEN REGIONS AND I CAN TALK ABOUT HOW WE DEFINE REGIONS IN THE STATE. THEIR PARTNERSHIPS OF LOCAL BUILDING TRADES COUNCILS JOINT APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS -- COMMITTEE BASED ORGANIZATIONS WORK FOR SPORTS SCHOOLS. THAT WE SERVE. TO TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE FROM DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. WE HAVE AN AVERAGE 80% COMPLETION RATE IN THOSE TRAINING PROGRAMS. SOME PROJECTS AROUND THE STATE AMONG THOSE TWELVE HAVE HAVE A WHICH IS GREAT -- FROM A WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PERSON PERSPECTIVE -- THOSE ARE AN INCREDIBLE NUMBERS ESPECIALLY FOR THE POPULATIONS THAT WE'RE SERVING. THE WE HAVE AN AVERAGE 70% PLACEMENT RATE WHICH IS ALSO INCREDIBLY GOOD FOR THIS HE'S POPULATIONS. WITH AROUND HALF OF THOSE FOLKS BEING PLACED. AS APPRENTICES -- AS YOU KNOW. TO BE A COMMON APPRENTICE IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO GET IN WHAT WE'RE DOING IS PREPARING PEOPLE GIVING THEM THE WHERE WITH ALL. TO BE COMPETITIVE AND THEN FINALLY LAND AS IN PRINTED SO AS THESE GUYS THIS. DEMONSTRATION PROJECT GOES WE'LL SEE MORE AND MORE PEOPLE BECOME THE PRINCES AS THE WORK BECOMES AVAILABLE. WITH THE PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU -- OUR INTENTION IS TO SCALE UP EXISTING PROJECTS -- THE DEMONSTRATION WORK AND THEY TRANSFER THE MODEL STATEWIDE INCLUDING TO OTHER SECTORS THAT ARE IDENTIFIED IN SCOPING PLAN. AND IT'S THE IT'S THE SAME THREE THREE PARTS. NUMBER ONE THE HIGH ROAD CONSTRUCTION CAREERS OUR INTENTION IS TO EXPAND THE CAPACITY IS A SAID TO FOURTEEN REGIONAL PARTNERSHIPS IT'S TEN MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY FOR FOR FIVE YEARS FROM THE G. G. R. F.. WE PLAN -- TO SERVE THREE THOUSAND DIS ADVANTAGE WORKERS THIS IS THE EQUITY WORK WE'RE DOING -- THAT WILL BE PREPARED FOR STATE APPROVED APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS. THOSE COSTS INCLUDE A LOT OF WRAPAROUND SERVICES FOR THESE POPULATIONS BECAUSE AGAIN THEY'RE FROM DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES -- INCLUDING RECRUITMENT WORK COUNSELLING MENTORING -- ALL KINDS OF SUPPORT INCLUDING STATEMENTS BECAUSE PEOPLE NEED MONEY IN THEIR POCKET IN ORDER TO BE GOING THROUGH TRAINING -- THE MC THREE TRAINING ITSELF PLACEMENT RETRENCHED RETENTION TRACKING THE WHOLE NINE YARDS -- THE NEXT ONE IS THE HIGH ROAD TRAINING PARTNERSHIPS -- BUILDING ON THAT -- THOSE THAT DEMONSTRATION WORK WE'RE GONNA EXPAND FROM THE CURRENT EIGHT TO TWENTY EIGHT PROJECTS STATEWIDE -- AND CLIMB IT IMPACTED INDUSTRIES. WE PLAN TO SERVER -- TWO THOUSAND DISADVANTAGE WORKERS. AND TWENTY EIGHT HI RETURNING PARTNERSHIPS ACROSS THE STATE THAT WILL BE INVESTING IN DEEP WORK THAT'LL BE SUSTAINED LONG TERM. AGAIN THE COSTS ARE -- BUILDING THE PARTNERSHIPS AMONG WORKERS AND MANAGEMENT LABOR AND MANAGEMENT -- BRINGING COMMITTEE BASED ORGANIZATION SCHOOLS WORK FORCE BOARDS TO HELP PEOPLE MOVE IN AT THE FRONT END -- ENTRY LEVEL JOBS -- IT INCLUDES DEEP SECTOR ASSESSMENT IN EVERY CASE PLANNING DEVELOPMENT ON THE FRONT END -- WE DO THE SAME RECRUITMENT COUNSELLING MENTORING -- SUPPORTS LIKE STIPENDS -- PLACEMENT RETENTION TRACKING EVERYTHING TO PROVIDE THOSE -- THOSE GENEROUS WRAPAROUND SERVICES FOR PEOPLE SO THEY CAN SUCCEED BOTH IN THE TRAINING BUT ALSO AS EMPLOYEES -- IN THESE GREAT MIDDLE CLASS JOBS. THERE'S A THIRD BID WHICH IS NEW FOR US. THE OTHER TWO ARE TRYING TRUE WE HAVE A GREAT DAY TO THAT DEMONSTRATES THAT IS GOOD WORK IT'S EFFECTIVE. WE WANT TO BUILD ON THAT THE WORKER TRANSITION FIND IS A NEW CONCEPT. IN CALIFORNIA I'VE BEEN A WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT FOR FOR QUITE A LONG TIME THERE'S A PRO A NATIONAL PROGRAM CALLED -- TRADE ACT ASSISTANCE. IT'S WHEN A COMPANY UP AND LEAVES AND CAUSES THE MASS CLOSURE AND IF THE COMPANY'S GOING OFF SHORE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- STATE APPLIES FOR THE FUNDS WILL PROVIDE REALLY GREAT TRANSITION ASSISTANCE TO THOSE WORKERS IT'S HARD MONEY TO GET. NOT EVERY EVENT QUALIFIES THE INTENTION HERE IS TO HAVE A TRANSITION FUND -- IN SECTORS THAT A CLIMATE IMPACTED. SO THAT WE CAN HELP WORKERS TRANSITION. THOSE THAT ARE IMPACTED BY BY THAT CHANGE AND AGAIN IT'S IT'S A IT'S A SUITE OF WRAPAROUND SERVICES TO HELP THOSE THOSE WORKERS WHO COULD BE EXTENSION OF COBRA. AS THEY DON'T LOSE YOUR HEALTH INSURANCE IT COULD BE -- EARLY RETIREMENT -- ALL KINDS OF INNOVATIVE THINGS THAT CAN BE DONE SO THAT YOU'RE NOT JUST TAKING MONEY OUT OF COMMUNITY PEOPLE STILL HAVE MONEY IN THEIR POCKETS THEY CAN GO THROUGH TRAINING -- AND HELPS TO SUPPORT THAT THE THE WHOLE COMMUNITY THROUGH A TRANSITION THAT'S THE WORKER -- TRANSITION FUND -- THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FOR THE PRESENTATION. ELLIE OUT DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT THE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLAR PROPOSAL BEFORE US. YEAH SO JUST DONE A COUPLE OF NOTES SOME -- JUST HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE THINGS THAT ARE IN YOUR AGENDA AS WELL -- THE THE PROPOSAL HERE. REALLY HAS KIND OF A FOCUS AS AS WAS MENTIONED ON KIND OF CAREERS AND UNLIKE A LOT OF THE OTHER -- FUNDING PROGRAMS FROM THE G. R. OUT THAT'S NOT SPECIFICALLY FOCUSED ON KIND OF PROJECTS THAT REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS SO I MEAN WE THINK THAT JUST IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION AS YOU THINK ABOUT HOW TO PRIORITIZE THIS. MONEY TO THOSE DIFFERENT TYPES OF ACTIVITIES. WE DO THINK THAT. THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANNA THINK ABOUT ASKING JUST SOME MORE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ABOUT SOME OF THE PARTICULAR PROPOSALS I THINK ON THE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS A CERTIFICATE EXPANSION OF EXISTING PROGRAMS -- IN PARTICULAR -- YOU KNOW HOW THE DEPARTMENT PLANS ON KIND OF SCALE IN THOSE OUT THAT SO IN SOME CASES A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT EXPANSION OF OF KIND OF AN EXISTING -- PROGRAM AND SO HOW THEY WILL SCALE IT UP AND I'LL STOP HERE IF I THINK IT AND I THINK IT'S A PRE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM SKEWS ME I'M SORRY BECAUSE THERE WERE IF IT WERE AN APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM ONE WOULD THINK THAT THAT. INDIVIDUAL WOULD BE OUT THERE DOING SOME POTENTIALLY DOING SOME GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION THIS IS A PRE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM THAT IS. BEFORE US IS A GUN THE GREENHOUSE GAS FUN. MY APOLOGIES MISS NO NO I JUST I pTHAT SAID ANOTHER STEP REMOVED ALTHOUGH WE'VE WE'VE HEARD ABOUT THEM AND AND TWO FORMER TRIED AND TRUE. BUT BUT THIS IS ANOTHER STEP REMOVED. YES YOU'RE YOU'RE RIGHT IT IS A A PRE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM WHICH IS -- BEFORE OBVIOUSLY SO -- I THINK ON THE WORKER TRANSITION PILOT PROGRAM -- WHICH WAS THE FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY -- OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS -- THIS IS UNLIKE THE OTHER ONES IS A NEW PROGRAM -- FOR THE FIRST COUPLE YEARS OUR OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IT -- THE FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WOULD FIND KIND OF A MESS A STUDY AND ASSESSMENT OF POTENTIAL COMMUNITIES THAT WOULD PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROGRAM. AND SO ONE IMPORTANT QUESTION IS. WE THINK IS IS WHETHER OR NOT SORT OF THE THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO COMMIT TO FIVE YEARS FONT OF FUNDING FOR THIS OR WHETHER OR NOT IT MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER ALLOCATING. MONEY FOR THE FIRST COUPLE OF YEARS AND MAYBE EVEN A POTENTIALLY A LOWER AMOUNT DEPENDING ON THE COST OF JUST THAT STUDY MEN COME BACK ONCE THE RESULTS OF THAT STUDY AN ASSESSMENT AND EVALUATE -- WHAT THE ON GOING NEEDS FOR SUCH A PILOT MIGHT BE -- AND SELL OUT A WITH MY COMMENTS AT THAT. NINE I KNOW THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THAT. MAY BE THREE NINE EIGHT WHICH INCLUDED LANGUAGE ABOUT. REIGNING DOESN'T BECOME LIVE UNTIL JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE OR AT LEAST FOR THE AUCTIONS THE PROCEEDS OF THE MEN. SO ARE IS THE CAP IS A SUBCOMMITTEE MISDIRECTED IF THEY'RE STINGY ABOUT SPENDING MONEY THAT HAS A DIRECT NEXUS BETWEEN GREENHOUSE GASES AT LEAST WHAT WE'RE STILL IN AN A. B. -- THIRTY TWO ARENA I MEAN I WOULD UNDERSTAND IF IF THIS IF THIS PROPOSAL WAS COMING BEFORE US NEXT YEAR WELL WE KNEW TWO OPTIONS WERE CLEARLY GOING TO BE IN. THERE AB THREE NINE EIGHT N. THREE OUT AND TWO OPTIONS GOING TO BE IN A AB THREE THIRTY TWO THEN YOU KNOW WE CAN DO THE MATH ON THAT. I MEAN I THINK THAT THERE'S QUITE A BIT OF UNCERTAINTY AROUND KIND OF AROUND THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE I MEAN IT'S DEFINITELY -- WORTH CONSIDERING AND KIND OF CONSIDERING THAT POTENTIAL LEGAL RISK ASSOCIATED WITH SPENDING ON THINGS THAT DON'T HAVE THAT CLEAR DIRECT GREENHOUSE GAS. TIE -- THERE'S A VARIETY OF OF CONSIDERATIONS AROUND KINDA YOU KNOW THE ALLOWANCES FUTURE ALLOWANCES THAT ARE SOLD IN WHAT RESTRICTIONS MIGHT BE ON THOSE A LOT THOSE KIND OF POST TWENTY TWENTY ALLOWANCES THAT ALREADY PART OF THE OPTIONS BUT CERTAINLY SORT OF THINKING ABOUT. WHATEVER LEGAL RESTRICTIONS MIGHT BE ON THESE FUNDS IS IS IS ONE IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION ARE WE START WE STILL SUIT. THAT LED LITIGATION NEVER GOT DISMISSED WHEN WE PASSED THREE NINE EIGHT DID IT. WE SORT OF I THINK WE'RE STILL BEING SUED FOR THE USE OF FUNDS THAT HAVE THE NEXUS. I DON'T REMEMBER I REMEMBER THAT CASE BEING DISMISSED ON THE WHAT THE STATUS OF IT IS. BUT I'M I'M I I GUESS I IT WELL IT WOULD MAYBE DEPEND ON HE PARTICULAR CASE I MEAN I KNOW THAT THE CASE AROUND KIND OF WHETHER OR NOT CAPTAIN TRADE REFLECTS A YOU KNOW REFLECTS A TAX OR SOME OTHER CHARGE THAT WAS. RESOLVED -- I I'M NOT FAMILIAR TO MAYBE ANOTHER CASE OUT THERE AROUND TO A PARTICULAR TYPE OF% SPENDING THAT I'D HAVE TO KNOW THE DETAILS. FINANCE -- THE THE ONE STEP REMOVED THESE ARE PRE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS TO EXISTING ONE KNEW THAT ARE REMOVED FROM THE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM CAN YOU HELP ME WITH THE NEXUS BETWEEN GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS. A PRE. AB THREE NINE EIGHT ERA AND WHICH IS BEFORE US. SURE SENATOR DANIEL BRANDON WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND I WOULD JUST SAY THAT THE PROPOSAL IS CONSISTENT WITH A B. THREE NINETY EIGHT AND VERY TIMELY GIVEN THE NEED FOR THESE TYPES OF JOBS IN THE CHANGING ECONOMY -- AND IT BEGINS TO ADDRESS THE NEED FOR THE INCREASED JOB TRAINING AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT -- TO BUILD THE CAPACITY TO TRANSITION INTO. THE REDUCED EMISSIONS COMIC THAT'S TRUE BUT THREE NINE EIGHT DOESN'T ONLY. THE AB THIRTY TWO ENDS IN DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY AB THREE NINE EIGHT STARTS IN JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE I'M HERE IN MRCH OF NINETEEN OF TWENTY NINETEEN SO YOU'RE ASKING. THIS COMMITTEE TO USE FUNDS FROM AUCTIONS AND SOME OF THEM MAY HAVE BEEN LAST YEAR'S AUCTIONS OR TWENTY SIXTEEN MONEY WHICH CLEARLY HAS TO SHOW A NEXUS. AND YOU'RE POINTING TO TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND SAYING BUT IT WILL BE LEGAL DURING THAT TIME. THAT'S THE QUESTION NOT THAT IT IS I GET DID IT FALL I FART READ THREE NINE EIGHT AND I GET THAT IF I WAS SITTING HERE A YEAR FROM NOW THIS WOULD BE AN EASIER QUESTION. BUT WE HAVE LOTS OF COMPETING. PROJECTS HERE IN AT LEAST I WANT TO MEET THE MINIMUM LEVEL LEGAL THRESHOLD THAT THERE'S A NEXUS. SO I UNDERSTAND IT HIS THREE NINE FIVE I'M ASKING YOU VISITED A B.. THIRTY TWO I THINK THE ANSWER IS NO. I MEAN IF IF IT WAS AN APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM A PROBABLY WOULD BE A LITTLE BIT CLOSER. BUT IT'S A PRE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM. THAT'S THE DILEMMA WE HAVE. OKAY JUST MAKE A QUICK COMMENT. THE THE PRECONSTRUCTION TRAINING PROGRAMS ARE DYINGIN ALIGNMENT CLOSE ALIGNMENT WITH THE LOCAL BUILDING TRADES COUNCILS AND THE JOINT APPRENTICESHIP TRAINING COMMITTEES THEMSELVES SO WHILE WE'RE DOING PRE APPRENTICESHIP WORK. THE CHANCES OF OF THESE INDIVIDUALS HE'S PARTICIPANTS TO LAND IN A PARTNERSHIP SLOTS IS VERY VERY HIGH IN FACT WE'VE HAD GREAT -- THE EXPERIENCE WITH THAT SO AS WE GET MORE WORK -- THAT IS PULLING CARBON IN THE ATMOSPHERE THERE'S A DEMAND FOR NEW APPRENTICES AND WE'RE FILLING THAT DEMAND IN CAHOOTS WITH MIDNIGHT I PRESUME THAT THAT'S TRUE THE QUESTION IS IS THAT WE HAVE A LIMITED USE OF THE FUNDS THERE BE BETTER. THAT RAN THE BANK RIGHT NOW IN A COUPLE OF YEARS WE GOT MORE FLEXIBILITY BUT THE LIMITED FUNDS THAT WE HAVE THAT THAT MAY BE TRUE AND THEY MAY GO OUT AND WORK ON ANAEROBIC DIGESTERS ARE HEALTHY SOILS OR WHAT. IT'S ONE OF THESE PROGRAMS IS GIVE US GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS IN SOME CO BENEFITS RIGHT BUT TODAY. THEY DON'T. CENTER MONEY YOUR QUESTION QUESTIONS. YES I WILL TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY JUST PICKING UP ON WHAT YOU SUGGESTED. THE DILEMMA IS YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO GET INTO THE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE PRE APPRENTICE TRAINING SO IT'S KIND OF A CATCH TWENTY TWO WE WANT TO HAVE THE POSITIVE IMPACTS IN TERMS OF THE WORK THAT'S DESIGNED. TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS BUT WE'RE NOT GONNA. MEET THAT GOAL IF WE DON'T HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE. PREPARED TO MOVE INTO THE APPRENTICE PROGRAM. SO. ONE COULD ARGUE THERE IS A NEXUS BUT IT'S NOT AN IMMEDIATE. COST BENEFIT OF THE DOLLAR BEING SPENT IS WHAT I HEAR YOU SUGGESTING OR IT COULD BE A DIFFERENT PROPOSAL. THAT THAT THE FUNDS FOR THIS YEAR'S FUNDING ON THE PRE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM WOULD COME FROM SOME OTHER SOURCE WITH THE IDEA THAT THE COMMITTEE THAT THAT HOPE WE SAT. NEXT YEAR IN THE FOLLOWING YEARS THEY WERE COME FROM GREENHOUSE GASES WHEN WE WERE UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF THREE NINE EIGHT JUICE I CAN'T. MAMA COMMA SENATOR IF YOU DON'T MIND. IT AND I DON'T WANT TO ARGUE THAT THE NEXUS QUESTION. BUT JUST TO CLARIFY THE WORK THAT WE'RE INVESTING IN. ANOTHER PROJECT TO CURRENT I RETURNING PARTNERSHIP THAT WE HAVE IS IN TRANSIT IN SEVERAL TRANSIT AGENCIES AROUND -- NORTHERN CALIFORNIA IS ACTUALLY BUILDING TO OTHER TRANSIT AGENCIES. IT WAS JUST TALKING TO THE HEAD OF AC TRANSIT THE OTHER DAY MY KERSH. THEY ARE BRINGING IN AS REQUIRED ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES BUSES. AND THE MAINTENANCE WORKERS -- ON THOSE BUSES IN THE MECHANICS AND THE OPERATORS ALL HAVE TO BE RETRAINED FOR ZERO EMISSION BUSES. IF WE DON'T HAVE THIS WORK FORCE TO DO THAT AND WE CO INVEST WITH THESE TRANSIT AGENCIES TO TOUGH TO TRAIN THESE WORKERS. THEY WERE GONNA HAVE FLEETS THERE SITTING IDLE -- SO THERE'S IT'S NOT JUST THE PRE APPRENTICESHIP IN THE CONSTRUCTION SECTOR WORKING WITH OTHER SECTORS THAT ARE THAT ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO PULLING KARMA ATMOSPHERE AND 5% OF THE FUNDS THAT WE RAISE FROM EACH OPTION THE GREENHOUSE GAS SINCE GASES. HAVE BEEN DESIGNATED AS ALONG WITH THE HIGH SEED RAIL AND WITH AFFORDABLE HOUSING SO IF THEY WANT TO GET THE MONEY OUT OF THAT POT. THAT'S THEIR BUSINESS WE'VE WE'VE ALLOCATED THAT MONEY THEY'RE ASKING FOR THE DISCRETIONARY POT TO BRING A NEW PROGRAM. FOR SOMETHING THAT CHALLENGES THE NEXUS AND THE CHILD AND THAT'S THAT'S MY ROLE HERE AND THAT'S THE ROLE THIS COMMITTEE IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WE WE SPEND MONEY BUT WE SPEND IT. IS WORLD LEGALLY ALLOWED TO SO. THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION IS TO REJECT WITHOUT PREJUDICE WHAT I'M PROPOSING IS THAT WE JUST HOLD IT OPEN. AS WELL AS ISSUE NUMBER ONE HERE AND WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO OPEN UP THE PUBLIC COMMENT THIS IS AN ISSUE NUMBER ONE ISSUE NUMBER TWO THESE ARE OUR CAP AND TRADE -- EXPENDITURE PLAN IN THAT WORK. WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. PLEASE PROCEED. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS PAUL YODER I'M HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT.

SECOND THING IS A DERRY JUDGE JESTER PROGRAM WE ALSO. BELIEVE THAT THAT SHOULD BE INCREASED -- AS IT IS FULLY SUBSCRIBED IN AGAIN AND ADDITIONALLY. THEN THIS THIS WON'T COST ANY MONEY A WASTE DIVERSION SECTION WE WOULD LIKE -- TO AND ENCOURAGE THAT OR FOR ORGANICS -- WASTE. THAT BE OPENED UP TO ALL TECHNOLOGIES RIGHT NOW CAL RECYCLES FOCUSED THERE'S ON TO PRIMARILY TO TUT TECHNOLOGIES YET TO MEET THE GOALS. THAT THE STATE HAS IDENTIFIED FOR ORGANICS WILL REQUIRE ALL TECHNOLOGIES AND WE BELIEVE THAT THERE WILL BE TRAILER THAT THERE NEED TO BE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE.

THAT -- INVESTMENT SHOULD BE MADE FOR LOW KNOCKS VEHICLES. WITH A HEALTHY INCREMENTAL -- VALVES FOR AMOUNT TO COVER THE THE COST -- ALSO FOR BIOFUELS -- WE DO BELIEVE PRODUCTION IN ST PRODUCTION -- ESPECIALLY IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES TO TAKE PLACE AND THAT A SIZABLE AMOUNT SHOULD BE I THE ALLOCATED FOR BOB I'LL FEEL PRIME PRODUCTION THANK YOU.

PIVOTAL TO MOVING INTO AN ACTIVE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT THAT BRINGS UP DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AT THE SAME TIME AND WE'RE NOT. SEEING THAT I'M REALLY ANYWHERE ON A STATEWIDE LEVEL LIKE HERE IN CALIFORNIA THROUGH THESE PROGRAMS -- AND MORE PRACTICALLY AS WE START TO DEVELOP DISADVANTAGE WORKER REQUIREMENTS ON THE FUNDING STREAMS THAT ARE HEADING OUT INTO.

GOOD AFTERNOON SEVENTY MORAL ON HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA TRUCKING ASSOCIATION -- IN SUPPORT OF A MULTI YEAR ALLOCATION OF G. R. F.

AND WE HOPE TO CONTINUE OUR STRONG PARTNERSHIP WITH THE STATE FOR CLEANER FREE TECHNOLOGY THANK YOU. THANKS I'M SURE MEMBERS AS ARE THE OTHER HALF OF THE STATE BUILDING CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL WELL I THINK THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR WORK ALSO THE ADMINISTRATION PREFERRING TOGETHER GREAT PROPOSAL WITH COST WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. IT IS TRUE WE ARE PARTNERS WITH THEM ON MANY OF THESE PROJECTS AND WOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS -- BE ADJUSTED SOMEWHAT BECAUSE WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS BUT WERE GENERALLY VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE DIRECTION THEY'RE GOING. ESPECIALLY WITH LABOR MANAGER BEING THE ACTUAL -- BASES OF A LOT OF THESE PARTNERSHIPS THAT WILL LEAD TO GOOD QUALITY UNION JOBS THANK YOU FOR HOLDING IT OPEN [inaudible] NEXT. GOOD AFTERNOON CAREMARK'S IN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES HERE TO SUPPORT A NUMBER OF PROGRAMS -- ALL VALUABLE -- IN THE PROPOSED ALLOCATION THE TRANSFORMATIVE CLEMENT COMMUNITIES PROGRAM SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THE HEALTHY SOILS PROGRAM BUT WOULD REALLY LIKE TO DRAW ATTENTION TO THE POINTS MADE BY CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE AND BY THE CHAIR ALSO REALLY. THE BIGGEST BANG FOR YOUR BUCK IN THE ALLOCATION IS INVESTMENT% IN ORGANIC WASTE DIVERSION -- CITIES AND COUNTIES ARE UNDER A A REQUIREMENT INITIATED BY US BE A THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE TO DIFFER ADDITIONAL ORGANIC MATERIAL OUT OF OUR LANDFILLS THE CRITICALLY NEED THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND MARKETS TO BE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH THIS GOAL. AND WE ASK FOR INCREASED INVESTMENT OF A HUNDRED MILLION THANK YOU. NEXT MORNING TURN MEMBERS PAUL MASON PACIFIC FOR A STRESSED I WANNA DRAW ATTENTION TO SOMETHING REALLY INSIGHTFUL THE CHAIR SAID DURING THE OPENING REMARKS. AND THAT'S THE INVESTMENTS OUTSIDE OF THE CAP SECTORS ARE GOING TO BRING US BETTER VALUE IN TERMS OF GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS THAN INVESTMENTS THAT ARE. ARE AROUND ACTIVITIES ARE ALREADY UNDER THE CAP BUT THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT ALSO SOMETHING THAT I THINK HAD CENTER STERN MAY HAVE MENTIONED WAS THAT IN TERMS OF OTHER PRIORITIES WE SHOULD BE ADVANCING HERE. ADAPTATION IN PREPARING FOR THE CLIMB WE'RE GOING TO BE LIVING IN THE FUTURE SHOULD BE A PRIORITY. THOSE TWO THINGS TOGETHER REALLY DRIVE YOU TOWARDS INCREASING INVESTMENTS IN THAT FOR WORKING LAMBS WHICH LARGELY TOOK A HIT IN THIS YEAR'S GREENHOUSE GAS -- BUDGET IN THE JANUARY PROPOSAL BECAUSE THAT'S GONNA BOTH FOR PARIS FOR CLIMATE THE PIRATE LIVING IN THE FUTURE AS WELL AS THE MORE COST EFFECTIVE AND SOME OF THOSE UNDER THE CAP. ALONG THOSE LINES WERE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO CAL FIRE WE THINK THAT SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE USED FOR A COMBINATION OF FOREST HEALTH AND FIRE PREVENTION THE WAY HAS BEEN IN THE PAST AT THE DEPARTMENT'S DISCRETION. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS SO ELEVEN SILAS WITH THE NATURE CONSERVANCY WE WOULD LIKE TO ALIGN OUR COMMENTS WITH OUR COLLEAGUE FROM THE PACIFIC FOR STRESS. AS WELL JUST BRING YOUR ATTENTION TO A LETTER THAT WAS -- CIRCULATED TO COMMITTEE IN REGARDS TO RESTRAIN PROPOSE YOUR DRAFT CUTS TO NATURAL WORKING LANDS PROGRAMS YOU KNOW IT'S OFTEN SAID THAT THE BUDGET IS A STATEMENT OF OUR VALUES IN CALIFORNIA SO WE THINK IT IS REALLY CRITICAL THAT A CLOSER LOOK IS PAID TO THAT.% AND IT WOULD ALSO JUST LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT SENATOR MUNNINGS COMMON INTO IN REGARDS THE IMPORTANCE OF LEARNING FOR CLIMATE ADAPTATION THERE IS ONE SPECIFIC PROGRAM. IN THAT TABLE THAT WAS FUNDED AT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS LAST YEAR THAT'S NOW OPEN IT AT THREE MILLION DOLLARS GIVEN ONGOING CONVERSATIONS WITH THE LEGISLATURE IN REGARDS TO SOME OF THE POTENTIAL DESTRUCTION IT COULD HAPPEN FROM SEA LEVEL RISE WE THINK. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT THAT AND WE DO UNDERSTAND THE PROP SIXTY DOLLARS WILL GO TO THAT -- BUT IT'S AN INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT ISSUE YESTERDAY INNOCENTLY BUDGETS OF THREE THE ELLIE -- MENTIONED SOME NEW YOU USGS DATA THAT SHOW THAT A PINCH TENSELY A HUNDRED AND FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS IN REAL ESTATE IS AT RISK -- BY TWENTY ONE HUNDRED WHICH IS EQUIVALENT TO SIX POINT SOME PRETTY BIG NUMBERS AND WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION ON THE ISSUE. HI MY NAME IS JULIE JORDAN AND WITH THE LEADERSHIP COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY -- WE WORK WITH LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES COMMUNITIES OF COLOR DISADVANTAGE UNINCORPORATED COMMUNITIES IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND THE CIRCUS ALL ABOUT THESE -- THESE COMMUNITIES AND FIGHTING FOR INVESTMENT IN AND OUT AN ADEQUATE INFRASTRUCTURE -- AND I'VE HAD TO DEAL DISPROPORTIONATELY WITH AIR QUALITY -- ACCESS TO TRANSPORTATION AND HIGH ENERGY BURDENS -- SO WE'RE HERE IN SUPPORT OF THE TRANSFER OF CLIMBING COMMUNITIES WE BELIEVE THIS IS A CRUCIAL TOOL FOR ADDRESSING NEEDS IN THESE COMMUNITIES -- AND WE SUPPORT ASKING A HUNDRED FORTY MILLION FOR THAT PROGRAM -- AND SPECIFICALLY WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THE DISADVANTAGE UNINCORPORATED AREAS ARE ABLE TO COMPETE FOR IMPLEMENTATION GRANTS -- IN THIS PROGRAM -- WE ALSO URGE YOU TO CONSIDER AND INCLUDE A PERCENTAGE OF FUNDS BE DIRECTLY AND SPECIFICALLY. TARGETED TOWARDS THIS BANDS ON THE CORPORATE COMMUNITIES. IN EASTERN TELL OF ALLEY FOR EXAMPLE THEY RECEIVED PLANNING GRANTS AND THE PROPOSED -- SEVERAL DIFFERENT PROJECTS INCLUDING RIDE CHER -- WEATHERIZATION PROJECTS EVER ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE AND ELECTRIC BUSES -- BUT THESE COMMUNITY VISIONS CAN'T EVEN YOU REALIZE UNLESS THIS MANAGED ON A CORPORATE COMMUNITIES ARE EXPLICITLY MADE ELIGIBLE FOR TCC GRANTS AND ARE GIVEN -- DIRECTED FUNDING UP WHICH WE THINK IS APPROPRIATE GIVEN EXTENSIVE HISTORIC ON INVESTMENT -- THE OTHER PROGRAM WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT IS THE METHANE REDUCTION IN SPECIFICALLY BURIED I JESTER -- HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS -- THAT HAVE BEEN SPENT SUBSIDIZING LARGE INDUSTRIAL DAIRY OPERATIONS WOULD BE MUCH BETTER SPENT ON PROJECTS THAT ARE ACTUALLY BENEFITTING DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES -- INVESTMENTS AND I JUST ENCOURAGE BIG DERRY'S ONLY GET BIGGER -- WITHOUT A CLEAR KIND OF DATA ABOUT THIS HOLISTIC IMPACTS IMPACTS OF THE ADJUSTER TECHNOLOGY -- INCREASING CONTAMINATION GROUND WATER AND AIR QUALITY -- WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATOR RECKON REFRAIN FROM INVESTING ANY JR F. DOLLARS UNDER DIGESTERS -- WE RAISE RAISED SEVERAL CONCERNS RELATED TO THAT I JUST -- PROGRAM -- AND THOSE QUESTIONS STILL REMAIN UNANSWERED. FOR EXAMPLE SEVERAL DIGESTIVE PROGRAMS CLAIM THEY BENEFIT DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES -- WHICH COMMUNITIES ARE WE TALKING ABOUT -- HOW THESE BENEFITS ACTUALLY VERIFIED -- ARE JERRY CLUSTERS IN INDUCING INCREASED CONCENTRATION OF THERE ISN'T HOUSE AND WHAT ARE THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF THAT TREND -- HAVE WE SEEN EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS FROM INVESTMENTS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN MADE. OUR INVESTMENTS ACTUALLY ENCOURAGING THE CREATION OF METHANE RATHER THAN IDENTIFYING MORE ECOLOGICAL WAYS OF APPROACHING AND MANAGING ANIMAL AGRICULTURE -- ARE THEY JUST THERE'S EVEN EFFECTIVE FOR SMALL SCALE -- DERES -- YOU MENTIONED THREE HUNDRED CAL DERRY'S MR WHY ARE DERRY'S COST EFFECTIVE. FOR THOSE ARE OUR DIGESTERS CASA FOR EFFECTIVE FOR THOSE AREAS OR IS IT REALLY JUST LARGE DAIRIES -- OVER THE LONG RUN ARE THEY FINANCIALLY SUSTAINABLE SO -- THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU NECKS. WELL GOOD MORNING MR TERM MEMBER THREE COMMA STRAIGHTEN OUT A WITH THE TRUST FOR PUBLIC LAND ECHOING THE COMMENTS ABOUT INVESTING IN NATURAL RESOURCE PROGRAMS FOR NOT JUST MITIGATION BUT ADAPTATION. I DO WANT TO FOCUS ON PROGRAMS THAT I KNOW THE BEST WHICH IS THE URBAN GREENING URBAN FORESTRY AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. I MEAN WE HAVE SEEN THE IMPACTS ON THE LANDSCAPE FROM CLIMATE CHANGE THROUGH WILDFIRES WE'VE GOT THE WORST FIRES IN THE HISTORY OF THE STATE OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. BUT WE KNOW AS I THINK SOME MEMBER I MAY HAVE MENTIONED EARLIER THAT THE THE FLOODING AND HE ARE COMMENT. AND MOST OF THE POPLE THAT LIVE IN THE STATE LIVE IN OUR HEARTS GAPED URBANIZED AREAS THAT ARE NOT PREPARED FOR HEAT OR FLOODING. IN THESE TWO PROGRAMS URBAN FORESTRY URBAN GREENING OUR INTERVENTIONS THAT. OUR WORK EXTREMELY URGENT IN MY OPINION AND YOU KNOW AND THERE'S A BOND THAT'S CIRCULATING IN THIS BODY RIGHT NOW TO ADDRESS ADAPTATION FOUR BILLION DOLLARS. THERE'S A SENSE OF URGENCY THERE BUT THAT'S GOING TO TAKE YEARS TO GET OUT THE DOOR IF THE VOTERS APPROVE IT. SO JUST URGE THE LEGISLATURE LOOK AT THESE TEACHER OF FUNDS -- FOR NATURAL RESOURCES PARTICULARLY WHERE ALL THE PEOPLE LIVE. THANK YOU. NEXT. HI STEPHANIE TIE WITH THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE LANCE SARAH -- WE'VE SHARED A LETTER ON SEVERAL DIFFERENT YEAR PROGRAMS WITH ALL OF YOU SO WE'LL GO THROUGH ALL OF THEM I JUST WANNA MAKE A FEW POINTS HERE TODAY -- FIRST ON SIX SEVENTEEN I THINK THE YOU KNOW THE BOTTOM LINE IS OUR COMMUNITIES REALLY NEED -- EMISSION REDUCTIONS AND THEY NEED IT NOW AND THEY NEEDED URGENTLY -- SO WE YOU KNOW WE WE DO NEED -- CARBON TO STEP IN AND PROVIDE STRONG STEVE MY GUIDANCE AND OVERSIGHT AT THE STATEWIDE LEVEL -- AND WE KNOW THAT THE RESOURCES AND STAFFING FOR THAT. ON ON THE WORK FORCE ISSUE I'M NOT GONNA ARGUE ON THE NEXUS REQUIREMENT BUT ANOTHER YOU KNOW BOTTOM LINE FOR OUR COMMUNITIES IS THAT WE REALLY DO NEED ACCESS -- YOU KNOW TO THESE CAREER PATHWAYS AND THAT THESE PROGRAMS DO ACTUALLY PROVIDE THAT CONNECTION -- FOR OUR COMMUNITIES YOU KNOW COMMUNION VERS SPECIALLY -- RESIDENTS WITH BARRIERS TO EMPLOYMENT TO ACTUALLY -- HAVE ACCESS TO THESE YOU KNOW GOOD UNION JOBS. ON THIRD -- STRONGLY AGREE WITH AND SUPPORT MY COLLEAGUE JULIA -- WITH LEADERSHIP COUNCIL JUSTICE.

YOU KNOW SHARE OUR OUR SENTIMENT ALIGN OUR OUR COMMENTS. WITH PACIFIC WORKS TRUST -- THE NATURE CONSERVANCY -- POINTS THAT RELATED TO HOW DISAPPOINTING WE DISAPPOINTED WE ARE AND THE ALLOCATIONS FOR OR PROPOSED ALLOCATIONS FOR THE NATURAL RESOURCES SECTOR. WE KNOW THAT IN ORDER FOR US TO BE ABLE TO MEET OUR CLIMATE GOALS IN THE LONG TERM WE NEED TO START INVESTING NOW IN IN IN NATURAL RESOURCES. THAT MEANS WETLANDS THAT MEANS -- HEALTHY SOILS THAT MEANS -- URBAN FORESTRY AND FOREST HEALTH. BUT WE WON'T GET THERE IF WE DON'T START INVESTING NOW -- INTO CENTERED MUNNINGS POINT -- OCEANS NEEDS TO BE PART OF THAT -- SOLUTIONS AS WELL WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE MONEY BE DIRECTED TO THE OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL TO BE ABLE TO START STRATEGIZING ON HOW WE GET. TO THAT POINT USING OUR OCEANS AS A WAY. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE REQUEST OR CARBON THANK YOU.

YES SO THE URBAN GREEN AND URBAN OF FORESTRY PROGRAM ARE CRITICAL TO IMPROVING THE WHOLE THING LIVE ABILITY IN METROPOLITAN AREAS WHERE THE MAJORITY OF CAL CALIFORNIANS LIVE. THESE PROGRAMS ARE NOT ONLY THE PRIMARY CARBON SEQUESTRATION. MECHANISM BUT THEY ALSO PROVIDE MULTIPLE COAL BENEFITS TO URBAN COMMUNITIES SUCH AS REDUCING THE URBAN HEAT ISLAND EFFECT -- HELP MANAGE -- FLOODING -- IMPROVE AIR AND WATER QUALITY AND PROVIDE HABITATS FOR WILDLIFE.

FOOD HAS TWO THINGS WE WOULD SAY WHEN YOU DO YOUR ASSESSMENT ON WHAT IS THE RIGHT DOLLAR AMOUNT FOR LOW CARBON TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS LOOK AT THAT NEED. CALIFORNIA SET OF FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OF A GOAL BY TWO EIGHT FIVE FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AS BY TWENTY THIRTY GOAL -- IS THE DOLLAR AMOUNT OF FOR A LOCATED IN THIS -- THIS YEAR GETTING US ON THAT TRAJECTORY AND THE SECOND THING IS IS THAT WE WOULD ECHO THE COMMENTS FROM EVERYBODY ABOUT WE NEED LONG TERM STABLE FUNDING FOR THESE.

GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN MEMBERS TREES WRECKAGE ON BEHALF OF THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL I WANT TO SPEAK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE LOW INCOME WEATHERIZATION PROGRAM. IT'S A CRITICAL SOURCE OF FUNDING TO MAINTAIN HEALTHY AFFORDABLE HOMES HOMES FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES THROUGH WEATHERIZATION AND SOLAR INSTALLATION. ALL OF THE DOUBLE L. A. W. P. SUBPROGRAMS ARE FULLY SUBSCRIBER THOUSANDS OF HOMES ON THE WAIT LIST WITHOUT SUBSTANTIAL FINDING THIS BUDGET CYCLE TWO OF THE LA W. PEAS MOST SUCCESSFUL. SUBPROGRAMS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO RE OPEN FOR TWELVE TO TWENTY FOUR MONTHS THIS IS SERIOUS REPERCUSSIONS ON THE LOCAL. WORK FORCE LA W. P. HAS A BROAD RANGE OF SUPPORT FROM OWNERS RENTERS BUSINESSES ADVOCATES IN COMMUNITIES AND WE URGE THE COMMITTEE TO ENSURE THE PROGRAM RECEIVES FUNDING IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. WE ARE JUST COMMITTED A SPARTAN ALLOCATION OF SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. AT THE US SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR BUDGET FOR THIS HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL IN CRITICAL PROGRAM I'D ALSO LIKE TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA COMPASS COALITION. WE WANT TO ALIGN OUR COMMENTS WITH THE CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE IN THE CHAIR WE ARE. HAPPY TO SEE A INCREASE IN ALLOCATION BUT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE IN THE FUTURE THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON COMMITTEE MY NAME IS ROCKY RUSSIAN WITH COALITION FOR CLEAN AIR. THE MOVEMENT OF GOODS IN CALIFORNIA ACCOUNTS 4405% OF OUR KNOCKS EMISSIONS. TRUCKS AND BUSES 37% OF OUR GHG EMISSIONS. MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS TRAVEL SIXTY MILLION MILES PER DAY OUR ROADS AND HIGHWAYS. THESE POLLUTANTS ARE PREVENTING MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS RATE BREEDING HEALTHY AIR AND ON THAT POINT CALLS FOR CLEAN AIR SUPPORT TO MULTI YEAR APPROPRIATION. FOR THE CALIFORNIA CLEAN TRUCK BUS IN OFF ROAD VEHICLE EQUIPMENT TECHNOLOGY PROGRAM. THIS WOULD UNDERSCORE OUR COMMITMENT TO INCENTIVIZE YOU ADVANCES IN CLEAN MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY TRANSPORT AS WELL AS OUR COMMITMENTS TO OUR CLEAN AIR AND CLIMATE GOALS. CALLS FOR CLEAN AIR IS ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL -- FOR AGRICULTURE EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS -- IN JANUARY. CAR WAS IN FRESNO AND APPROVED A PLAN TO FOR THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY TO ACHIEVE FEDERAL ERA AT AIR QUALITY ATTAINMENT. IT WASN'T MANT TO BE AN ASPIRATIONAL PLAN. AND THE FUNDING -- THAT THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS LAID OUT AND IN PARTICULAR FOR DIESEL ENGINE REPLACEMENT -- IS FAR FROM ADEQUATE AND WE WOULD HOPE THAT THE SENATE WOULD -- RECTIFY THAT PROBLEM AS WELL I WOULD DO IT WOULD JUST LIKE TO INCORPORATE MIKE -- OUR COMMENTS WITH SOME OF THE COMMENTS MADE ON S. B. -- AB SIX ONE SEVEN IMPLEMENTATION. CRITICAL -- CRITICAL PROGRAM. THANKS SO MUCH THANK YOU NEXT. BUT YOUR MEMBERS BRIAN SHOW BUT THE CALIFORNIA CLIMATE AGRICULTURE NETWORK. I'M CONTINUING THE THEME OF FARMS AND ADAPTATION -- SMALL AND MID SCALE FARMS ARE THE ONES THAT ARE MOST AT RISK OF THE NEXT DROUGHT. AND OTHER CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS -- SO WE'RE ASKING FOR A FORTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE SWEET PROGRAM TO HELP THEM -- REMAIN RESILIENT TO THE NEXT ROUND AND FINANCE THEIR TRANSITION TO CLEANER AND MORE EFFICIENT IRRIGATION SYSTEMS. THREE QUARTERS OF THOSE GRANTS HAVE GONE TO THE FARMS OF FIVE HUNDRED ACRES OR LESS AND THE PROGRAM'S BEEN CONSISTENTLY OVERSUBSCRIBED BY TWO TO THREE TIMES OVER SIX ROUNDS. I DID WANT TO CORRECT -- SOMETHING THAT WAS SAID EARLIER ABOUT THE PROGRAM THE PROGRAM DID RECEIVE TWENTY MILLION LAST YEAR FROM POP SIXTY EIGHT BUT THOSE FUNDS WILL BE SPENT ON THIS YEAR AND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET HAVE. HAS NO MONEY FOR THE PROGRAM SO UNLESS WE GET YOU DRAFT THE PROGRAM WILL DISCONTINUE.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS KODI BLOWS THE CALIFORNIA ADVANCED BIO FUELS ALLIANCE AND I TO ALLY MY COMMENTS WITH THE PREVIOUS -- SPEAKER FROM A CLEAN ENERGY AND JUST HIGHLIGHT THAT IN ST BIOFUELS PRODUCTION NOT ONLY PROVIDES A SOURCE OF GHG REDUCTIONS BUT ALSO A SOURCE OF A LIVING WAGE JOBS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NEXT. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE BRANDING RCM HAVE A SEAT ON OUR ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES WE WANNA LANA COMMENTS OF CALIFORNIA TO CANCEL A SO WE WANT TO EMPHASIZE.

IN FIFTY TO A HUNDRED NEW EXPANDED RECYCLING ORGANIC WASTE FACILITIES. HELLO KELLY ROBBINS HERE. KAYLA ROBINSON HERE ON BEHALF OF RETHINK WASTE AND WE JUST LIKE TO ALIGN OUR COMMENTS I'M WITH THE COMMENTS MADE BY SEA AND ARE. THEY GIVE NECKS. DANIEL TORE IS WITH THE FLAVORS CENTER IN LOS ANGELES -- WE PREPARE PEOPLE RETURNING HOME FROM INCARCERATION ARM FOR CAREERS IN UNION CONSTRUCTION -- I'M HERE TO SAY THAT.

THOSE COUNCILS WE KNOW THAT CONSTRUCTION AND GREEN BUILDING IS SO INTERTWINED IT'S NOT EVEN CALL GREEN CONSTRUCTION ANYMORE IS CALLED CONSTRUCTION. THAT'S HOW EMBEDDED ARM BEING AWARE OF THIS GREENHOUSE EMISSIONS STUFF IS. IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY. THOSE PARTNERSHIPS ONLY POSSIBLE IS DRIVEN BY LABOR DEMAND SO THE THE BUILDING TRADES ONLY GIVE THESE PARTNERSHIPS IF THAT DEMAND IS THERE. SO TO JUST SPEAK TO THE POINT OF US BEING A STEP REMOVED -- FROM AN ACTUAL APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM. I KNOW FIRST HAND. THAT THE BUILDING TRADES ARE FULLY ONBOARD WITH WHAT'S GOING ON FROM AS FAR AS MC THREE CURRICULUM. THERE'S EVEN CONTENT A CHAPTER IN THE CURRICULUM THAT I'VE I TEACH.

WE WE AGREE WITH COMMENTS THAT THE TWO ARE MILLION -- FOR THAT PROGRAM IS A FLAT LINE IT'S NOT GOING TO KEEP PACE WITH THE DEMAND FOR ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES THAT WE KNOW WE NEED -- ON THE SIX ONE EIGHTY SIX ONE SEVEN PROGRAM AGAIN WE SUPPORT THE NEED FOR AN ONGOING FUNDING SOURCE FOR THAT. MAKING UP THE SHORTFALL THAT'S BEEN -- PROPOSE THIS IN THIS BUDGET AND REALLY MAKING SURE THAT OUR LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS IN OUR STATE AGENCIES ARE ADEQUATELY FUNDED TO CARRY THAT OUT AS A PRO PROGRAM EXPANDS.

I WANT TO CLARIFY A FEW THINGS ON THE JERRY METHANE FRONT -- WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF A BUDGET LINE ITEM FOR THE ALTERNATIVE NOR MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. THIS IS THE AMP IS A VERY POPULAR PROGRAM WITH THE DAIRY PRODUCERS THAT WE WORK WITH -- MOST ARIES ONLY ABOUT 20% OF THE STATE'S JERRY'S CAN ACTUALLY DO A DYING JESTER BECAUSE THEY DON'T PRODUCE ENOUGH NOR -- TO JUSTIFY IT NOR DO THEY HAVE THE CAPITAL TO DO IT I JUST -- SO THEY MUST DO SOMETHING ELSE IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THEIR METHANE ISSUES AND THEY'VE BEEN DOING IT -- BUT THE WAY THE AMP FUNDING HAS HAPPENED IS A CHUNK OF MONEY IS GIVEN TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE AND THEY DISPERSE THE FUNDS TO DIE GESTURES. AND FOR AMP AMP IS OVERSUBSCRIBED ABOUT 20% OF THE DAIRY METHANE FUNDS HAVE GONE TO AMP AND AS A CONSEQUENCE WE HAVE MANY JERRY IS -- THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO GET INTO THE ALTERMAN OR MANAGEMENT PROGRAM BECAUSE THERE SIMPLY ISN'T A FUNDS. SO -- AMPAS REACH THIRTEEN COUNTY IS WITH OVER FIFTY PROJECTS SO FAR -- COMPARED TO JUST SIX COUNTIES FOR THE DERRY DIGEST HER PROGRAM -- DIE JESTERS WORK AGAIN IF YOU CAN INVEST MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND HAVE A MATURE THAT WILL FEED THEM FOR THE LONG TERM.

IT COMPARED TO SORT OF WHAT WE'VE BEEN DEALING WITH SAY IN THE LAST TWO YEARS OR SO -- THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION CENTER WHAT I CAN SPEAK TO ON THE SAFETY ENFORCEMENT SIDE -- WE HAVE 3% TO STAFF THEY'RE DEDICATED WILDFIRES FOR THE ENTIRE STATE. AND SO AS A RESULT WE HAVE TO TAP AND OTHER RESOURCES PRIMARILY OUR ELECTRIC SAFETY AND RELIABILITY BRANCH AND HAVE THAT STAFF COVER DOWN ON WILD FIRE INSPECTIONS INVESTIGATIONS TO INCLUDE THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN FIRES -- IT JUST IN THE SAFETY AROUND AND RIGHT NOW I HAVE NINETEEN OUT OF THIRTY SEVEN STAFF. DEDICATED TO SOMETHING WILD FIRE. THE OTHER STAFF THAT WERE NOT DESIGNED OR HIRED TO BE DOING THOSE FUNCTIONS. WITH THIS B. C. P. COMES THE CREATION OF THE WATER FAR SAFETY ENFORCEMENT BRANCH -- SOLE PURPOSE IT WILL BE TO REVIEW THE PLANS AND FORCE THE PLANS CONDUCT THE AUDITS AND CONDUCT THE INVESTIGATIONS SO WHILE I CAN'T GIVE AN EXACT TIME OFF FASTER WOULD GO.

THANK YOU SO MUCH TO HAVE A QUICK QUESTION BUT ONE SEE IF WE HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM TWENTY TO TIME. IS A VERY QUICKLY -- ALLOW FOR MITIGATION PLAN SO. WHAT DO YOU HAVE STACKED UP IN THE QUEUE AT THE MOMENT? SO YOU KNOW YOU'RE SAYING I NEED TO GET TO GET THROUGH AN EIGHTEEN MONTHS CORRECT. YES OKAY WHAT WE HAVE SET UP AND WHAT WE ANTICIPATE HERE IN THE FUTURE IN CANDIDATES IS GOING TO BE ENOUGH. GOOD. SO WE ARE THE CURRENT NUMBERS ARE BASED OFF OF THE ANTICIPATED WORKLOAD WAS BECAUSE TO BE HONEST WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THESE WERE OFF OUR PLANS WERE GONNA LOOK LIKE ONCE UTILITY SUBMITTED. SO THEY WERE SUBMITTED ON FEBRUARY SIX WE HAVE NINETY DAYS TO REVIEW AND APPROVE THOSE PLANS -- THAT'S BOTH YOU KNOW EVERYTHING FROM S. T. D. TO LEGAL TO A JAY AND IT ALSO INCLUDES A GOING TO CAL FIRE FOR THEIR REVIEW AS WELL. SO JUST THE PLANS BY THEMSELVES AS AN EXTREMELY FAST TURN AROUND THAT IS CONSUMING A LOT OF STAFF CALORIES TO GET THOSE PLANTS THROUGH. THAT'S NOT GONNA CHANGE YEAR TO YEAR IS JUST GOING TO KEEP ON COMING EACH AND EVERY YEAR. SO WITH THAT ANTICIPATED WORKLOAD BEYOND ONCE THE PLANTS ARE ACTUALLY APPROVED AND NOW HAVE TO BE ENFORCED -- THAT'S WHERE WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT GAP.

SO IN TERMS OF THAT YOU KNOW IS LAID OUT THAT WE HAVE NINETY DAYS TO DO IT AND IT'S THE TOP PRIORITY OF THE COMMISSION RIGHT NOW -- AS WELL AS CAL FIRE AS A WORKING WITH -- YOU KNOW HAND IN HAND ON IT.

WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO BE L. M. SO THAT WE CAN. WE CAN DO SOME WORK AND AND OTHER. COUNTY AGENCIES IN RENO WITH. THE ON THE PUBLIC LANDS CENTER WE ONLY HAVE 3% AND IN THAT AT THE FORCE BUT THERE'S OTHER PUBLIC LANDS THAT ARE -- AVAILABLE IF THERE'S AGREEMENTS.

FORMALLY KNOWN AS THE OFFICE OF REPAIR OF THE KIDS. ARE WITH ME HERE TODAY IS CHLOE LUKENS SHE'S THE PROGRAM MANAGER OVER ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUES. BUT WE ARE REQUESTING THREE POSITIONS TO WORK ON ELECTRIC INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUES OUR INFRASTRUCTURE WORK FOCUSES ON TWO MAIN AREAS. DISTRIBUTION PLANNING AND TRANSMISSION PLANNING AND PERMITTING. WITH RESPECT TO A MEETING NEW AND ONGOING WORKLOAD ON DISTRIBUTION PLANNING WE REQUEST ONE ENGINEER POSITION. DISTRIBUTION PLANNING HAS DRAMATICALLY CHANGED WITH THE STATE'S GOAL OF INCREASING THE USE OF RESOURCES THAT CAN CONNECT DIRECTLY TO THE UTILITIES DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS SUCH AS STORAGE. SOLAR. AND ELECTRIC VEHICLES. NEW PROCESSES HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED TO ALLOW FOR VISIBILITY INTO THE UTILITIES DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS. AND BROADER PARTICIPATION AND DISTRIBUTION PLANNING. HE DID THIS OFFER IS IDENTIFYING WHERE BEST TO INTERCONNECT ON THE SYSTEMS. WHILE ENSURING SAFETY AND RELIABILITY. IN RESPONSE TO THE COMMITTEE STAFF COMMENTS I WOULD LIKE TO CLARIFY THAT THE DISTRIBUTION PLANNING. IS AN ANNUAL AN ON GOING PROCESS THAT ENTAILS REVIEW AND ASSESSMENT OF COMPLEX TECHNICAL DATA WHICH WE MUST ANALYZE IN ORDER TO ENSURE A REPAIR INTERESTS ARE CONSIDERED. FOR EXAMPLE EVERY YEAR EACH UTILITY WILL FILE A REPORT THAT PROVIDES AN ASSESSMENT OF THEIR SYSTEMS CAPACITY. THEY WILL ALSO PROVIDE FORECASTS OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND ON THEIR SYSTEMS AND IDENTIFY AREAS THAT REQUIRE UPGRADES OR OTHER CHANGES. UTILITIES ALSO FAR REPORTS THAT IDENTIFY SYSTEM UPGRADES AND NEW CONSTRUCTION NEEDS. THAT COULD BE DEFERRED WITH DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCES. WE REVIEW ALL THIS INFORMATION FOR ACCURACY AND TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE UTILITIES PLANTS AFFECTIVELY ENSURE RELIABILITY. AS WELL AS OUR COST EFFECTIVE. THE ENGINEERING POSITION WILL ENABLE US TO ADDRESS THIS NEW WORKLOAD. I'D LIKE TO SWITCH OVER THE TRANSMISSION INFRASTRUCTURE -- WE ALSO ARE REQUESTING ONE ENGINEERING POSITION AND ONE ATTORNEY POSITION -- THEY WOULD FOCUS ON THE INCREASING NUMBER OF TRANSMISSION PLANNING ACTIVITIES AND PERMITTING APPLICATIONS. ARE ADVOCACY AND TRANSMISSION ISSUES CAN LOWER COST OF REPAIRS BY HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. AND THE LAST TWO YEARS THERE'S BEEN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF PROPOSALS FOR NEW TRANSMISSION INFRASTRUCTURE AND UPGRADES. THESE PROPOSALS ARE INTENDED TO ADDRESS RELIABILITY AND SYSTEM CONGESTION ISSUES WHICH ARISE FROM THE STATE'S INCREASING RENEWABLE ENERGY GOALS INCLUDING -- THE ABILITY TO EXPORT EXCESS ENERGY TO OTHER STATES. TRANSMISSION PROJECTS ARE VERY EXPENSIVE ENDEAVORS HAVE UTILITIES TYPICALLY REQUEST HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN COST RECOVERY FROM REPAIRS. LOOK AT THE GATES OFFICE IS OFTEN THE ONLY PARTY ASIDE FROM THE UTILITY PARTICIPATING IN THESE PROCEEDINGS. OUR PARTICIPATION IS IMPORTANT THAT WE CONDUCT COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSES INSURE THAT THE PROJECTS ARE NEEDED. THAT THE COSTS ARE REASONABLE AND WHERE POSSIBLE WE IDENTIFY MORE COST EFFECTIVE ALTERNATIVES. THE STAFF COMMENTS CORRECTLY NOTE THAT THIS IS ONGOING AND INCREASING WORK. FOURTEEN NEW APPLICATIONS FOR TRANSMISSION UPGRADES OR NEW CONSTRUCTION ARE EXPECTED TO BE FILED BY THE END OF THIS YEAR. THIS IS ON TOP OF THE APPLICATIONS FILED LAST YEAR THAT ARE STILL BEING LITIGATED OUT THE CPUC. IN ADDITION THE UTILITIES WILL FOLLOW ADVICE LETTERS FOR SMALLER TRANSMISSION PROJECTS WHICH WAS ALSO ANALYZE. OUR REQUEST FOR THESE THREE POSITIONS ON INFRASTRUCTURE WILL ALLOW US TO ADDRESS THIS INCREASED WORKLOAD. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE I GUESS MAYBE CAN YOU CLARIFY THAT. I'M PRESUMING IF THE I. O. YOU PASS FOR SUBMITS AN ADVICE LETTER THAT'S LESS ANALYSIS FOR AN ENGINEER -- FOR AN ATTORNEY TO DO VERSUS A FULL. BLOWN HEARING -- THAT THEY HAVE IS THAT IF MY MISSING THE POINT HERE IN SOME CASES THAT IT THAT HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN TRUE BUT RECENTLY WE HAVE BEEN RECEIVING LARGER PROJECTS THROUGH THE ADVICE LETTER PROCESS WHICH REQUIRES MORE COMPLEX ANALYSIS. THAT IS NOT WE DO NOT BELIEVE THIS PROJECT SHOULD BE SUBMITTED THROUGH THE ADVICE LETTER PROCESS AND WE HAVE PROTESTED USING THAT PROCEDURE VEHICLE HELLO [inaudible] NO CONCERNS [inaudible] COLLEAGUES. QUESTIONS ON THIS WILL GET A HOLD IT OPEN -- AND WE'LL CONTINUE OUR DISCUSSIONS LET'S GO TO A S. B. NINE A ONE THE FOURTEEN POSITION SHE WON FOR THE S. B. NINE A ONE BEFORE I BEGIN. TO INTRODUCE THIS REQUEST I WANT TO INTRODUCE THAT SKINNER HE'S A SUPERVISOR OVER SAFETY SECTION. IN THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL WE PUT WE REQUEST FOURTEEN NEW POSITIONS TO HELP IMPLEMENT THE WILD FIRE SAFETY AND WELFARE COST RECOVERY PROVISIONS OF SB. NINE OH ONE THIS BILL INSTITUTED SIGNIFICANT NEW AND ONGOING REQUIREMENTS UPON THE SIX INVESTOR OWNED UTILITY ELECTRIC UTILITIES. THE NEW REQUIREMENTS ARE IN TWO MAIN AREAS. WILDFIRE RISK MITIGATION AND WHILE FOR COST RECOVERY IN SECURITIZATION. EACH OF THESE EFFORTS HAVE STATUTORY STATUTORILY MANDATED TIME LINES AND FREQUENCY THAT REQUIRE US TO INCREASE OUR STAFFING SO THAT WE CAN. ADVOCATE ON BEHALF OF REPAIRS TO OBTAIN THE LOWEST POSSIBLE RATE. FOR SERVICE CONSISTENT WITH SAFETY AND RELIABILITY. TURNING FIRST TO THE WILD FIRE RISK MITIGATION. WE HAVE REQUESTED FIVE NEW POSITIONS TO REPRESENT RATEPAYERS. OF FOCUS ON WELFARE MITIGATION PLAN PROCEEDINGS. STARTING IN TWENTY TWENTY WE WILL BE PARTS PARTICIPATING IN A MINIMUM OF TWELVE NEW PROCEEDINGS EVERY YEAR. A NEW POSITIONS WE REQUEST WILL PROVIDE US WITH THE RESOURCES THE THOROUGHLY AND COMPLETELY EVALUATE THE PLANS TO ENSURE THAT REPAIR INTERESTS ARE PROTECTED. TURNING NOW TO THE WORKS OF ART THERE. WE'VE GOT WE'VE GOT FIRE PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING TO COME IN AND FORCE MANAGEMENT PEOPLE AND TEMPER PEOPLE THOSE EXPERTS THAT THEY UNDERSTAND HOW A FIRE IS MANAGE. I'M A LAWYER. I ACTUALLY DON'T KNOW I MEAN I'M I KNOW ON THE CHAIR THIS COMMITTEE I ACTUALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO AND I READ THE REPORT WHAT WILL YOUR FIVE PEOPLE DO. WHAT WOULD YOU WHAT ONE OF FIRE MITIGATION HOW WITH THE PEEL AWAY KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT THE OTHER THAN LEARNING AS YOU GO? THIS IS [inaudible] WHAT WHAT [inaudible] BECAUSE BECAUSE THEY'RE GONNA COME IN WITH THE TECHNICAL ANSWERS. ANY ISSUE ARE YOU GONNA SAY THAT'S TOO MUCH MONEY FOR THE REPAIRS TO PAY OR WE DON'T WANT TO PAY THAT. VERSES JUST WHETHER IT DOES THE THE MEDICATION OR NOT. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. WIFI POSITIONS I MEAN. ABOUT SOMETHING THAT WE I I GET NICE I'LL SAY I DON'T KNOW ABOUT IT RIGHT WHATEVER IT IS I WOULD LOOK AT THE SCIENCE THAT THEY COULD COME UP WITH. HOW DO YOU ENVISION THOSE WITH THOSE PEOPLE WOULD DO AND JUST THE MEDICATION THE OTHER PART? I GET A PAT ON THE MEDICATION WHICH IS A TECHNICAL FORESTRY SCIENCE. WHAT IS A REPAIR ADVOCATE? AND IT'S TOO MUCH THE SICKEST MARKET MY QUESTION I DON'T LIKE TO PAY THAT BILL. OKAY WELL I THINK THE PEOPLE GET IT NOT LIKE IT IT'S DOES IT WORK OR DOES IT NOT WORK. THE TRAINING. NOW. WHO THESE PEOPLE BE? THE QUESTION IS WE'RE GONNA HOLD IT I'M JUST THROWING IT OUT THERE IF YOU. DON'T FEEL COMPELLED TO ANSWER IT NO WHAT WE REVIEW IN THESE PROCEEDINGS IN MATTERS OF SAFETY CHAIRMAN IS WE LOOK AT THE ADEQUACY OF THE UTILITY FILING ARE THEY TAKING THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THESE EXPERTS. IN FORESTRY AND WILD FIRE WE HAVE OUR OWN SAFETY PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPERTS IN A VARIETY OF SAFETY TOPICS ONE OF THE AREAS THAT THESE ARE INTENDED TO INCREASE. IS EXACTLY IN THE AREAS OF FIRE SAFETY COVERED CONDUCTOR WEATHER MONITORING FORECASTING -- A VARIETY OF TOPICS AND ISSUES THAT REALLY EXACTLY TO PREVENTING CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES. WE RECENTLY REVIEWED THE UTILITIES FILINGS IN THEIR TWENTY NINETEEN WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLANS. AND ONE OF THE CONSISTENT THEMES THAT WE IDENTIFIED AND WE'RE STILL REVIEWING WITH THE OTHER PARTY SAID THAT TO DATE. WE ARE THE ONLY PARTY THAT IS HOLISTICALLY INCONSISTENTLY EXAMINED THE ADEQUACY OF THESE PROGRAMS. AT THE PROGRAMMATIC LEVEL -- SO FOR EXAMPLE DO THE UTILITIES ACTUALLY KNOW HOW MUCH RISK WILL BE REDUCED ARE THEY ACTUALLY PUTTING THESE PROGRAMS AND PROJECTS. IN THE HIGH THREAT FIRE AREAS IDENTIFIED BY CAL FIRE ARE THEY GOING OUTSIDE OF THOSE AREAS IF THEY ARE GOING OUTSIDE OF THOSE AREAS WHY. SO IT'S NOT AT THIS POINT IT'S NOT LOOKING AT THE MONEY THERE'S ALWAYS OF COURSE ARE YOU DOING IT EFFICIENTLY BUT THIS IS ARE YOU DOING IT IN THE RIGHT AREAS. THAT WILL ADEQUATELY REDUCE RISK. LEO DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT THIS ON THE NOVELTY OF THE STAFF REPORT TALKS ABOUT THE NOVELTY OF THIS. NEW. ARENA WE'RE GETTING ON WITH THE PLO. I'M A WE DON'T HAVE ANY PARTICULAR COMMENTS I MEAN I I THINK YOU KNOW CERTAINLY WAS SORT OF THE NEW ACTIVITIES THERE WILL LIKELY NEED TO BE SOME KIND OF YOU KNOW NEW EXPERTISE THAT KIND OF GES INTO. A SIGN IN THE RIGHT POSITIONS ON RIGHT PEOPLE TO THAT THAT ACTIVITY. OKAY PLEASE PROCEED OKAY. I'M GONNA GET TO THE SECOND AREA OF OUR OUR SAFETY BCP -- AND THAT IS THE FOCUS ON WELFARE COSTS AND SECURITIZATION. OF WHERE WE ARE ASKING FOR FIVE POSITIONS AS WELL -- WE ARE REQUESTING THESE POSITIONS TO CONDUCT FINANCIAL ECONOMIC AND POLICY ANALYSIS OF THE REASONABLENESS OF THE UTILITY COSTS REQUEST. IN REVIEWING P. GENIES WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLAN WE'VE IDENTIFIED EXTENSIVE OVERLAP WITH THE PROPOSALS PRESENTED IMPEACHING NEEDS TWENTY TWENTY GENERAL RATE CASE APPLICATION. NOT ONLY FROM A PROGRAMMATIC LEVEL AND A PROJECT BASIS BUT ALSO FROM A COST BASIS. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE SCRUTINIZE THE UTILITIES PROPOSALS TO ENSURE THAT THEIR COSTS ARE REASONABLE. AND THAT THEY ARE NOT SEEKING COST RECOVERY FOR THE SAME PROGRAMS IN DIFFERENT PROCEEDINGS. THE NEW POSITIONS ALSO WILL PERFORM TH ANALYSIS ASSOCIATED WITH REPAIR PROTECTION FINANCING. FINALLY WE HAVE REQUESTED FOR ATTORNEY POSITIONS TO PROVIDE LEGAL SUPPORT IN PREPARING DISCOVERY. OF LEGAL BRIEFS AND DEALING WITH THE NECESSARY LEGAL MATTERS TO SUPPORT OUR OUR POLICY TECHNICAL EFFORT. SO LET'S SAY ONE OF THE FOUR TOURNEY'S DETERMINES THAT THEY BELIEVE THAT THE THERE -- OVER SECURED. THERE'S THEY'RE THEY'RE ASKING FOR SOME FUNDS TO TO TO DO SOME WORK AND IT'S A HUNDRED DOLLARS OF WORK TO DO AND THEY'VE GOT AN ASSET WORTH A THOUSAND DOLLARS AND THEY WANT TO SECURE THE PAYMENT OF THAT [inaudible] SO WHAT [inaudible] WHAT? IT'S A SECURE IT'S ONLY SECURED TO THE HUNDRED DOLLARS. WHAT DIFFERENCE WOULD IT MAKE BECAUSE YOU CAN HAVE? IT WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE. TO THE NEXT PERSON WANTS TO SECURE BECAUSE THEY BE IN SECOND POSITION THEY WOULD HAVE NOT HAVE PRIORITY RIGHT BUT AS FAR AS THE AS AS HOW TO GUARANTEEING THE REPAYMENT. OF OF THAT THE MONEY THAT THEY HAVE. WHY IT WHY WOULD THE WAY WITH THE P. YOU SEE NOT BE ABLE TO FIGURE THAT OUT AND AND A NICE KNOWLEDGE OF HOW WHAT WOULD WHAT DO YOU ENVISION THE PA OF? DOING JUST A KIND OF FIND THAT THIS IS OVER SECURED. PART OF THE CHALLENGE THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS. UNDERNEATH SP NINE OH ONE IF SECURITIZATION OCCURS AND THAT VALUE IS NOT THE RIGHT VALUE IN THE CASE THAT YOU PRESENTED. IT'S A HUNDRED DOLLARS WE KNOW IT'S A THOUSAND DOLLARS IT'S NOT PARTICULARLY PROBLEMATIC. IF IT WAS BEFORE AT A THOUSAND DOLLARS AND THEY WANT TO COME IN FOR ANOTHER. FIVE HUNDRED WELL THAT BECOMES PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE IF THE EXTRA FIVE HUNDRED IS MONEY THAT. IN THE CASE OF UTILITY WRONGDOING SHAREHOLDERS COULD'VE ABSORBED AS IS CONTEMPLATED FOR THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN WILDFIRES. ONCE THAT BECOMES SECURED SP NINE A ONE MEANS THAT EVEN IF WE INVESTIGATE AND FIND OUT THAT THE SHAREHOLDERS COULD HAVE AND SHOULD HAVE PROPERLY BORN THOSE COSTS. IT IS NOW PERMANENTLY ASSIGNED TO RATE PAYERS INTEL THAT SECURITIZATION HAS BEEN PAID OFF IN TEN TWENTY OR THIRTY YEARS DOWN THE ROAD. SO THAT'S PART OF WHAT OUR EXAMINATION WOULD BE IS IN THE CASE OF THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN FIRES HAVE THE UTILITIES BORN WITH A PROPERLY CANNIBAL MEETING THE REQUIREMENTS OF S. B. NINE A ONE AND FOR ANY WILD FIRES THAT OCCUR BETWEEN. TWENTY NINETEEN AND TWENTY THIRTY FIVE WITHOUT AUTHORITY EXPIRES AGAIN HOW THE RIGHT AMOUNTS LEVELS BEEN ACHIEVED BECAUSE THE IS ONCE THE SECURITIZATION BONDS ARE ISSUED. WE CANNOT GO BACK AND CHANGE THEM BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT S. B. NINE A ONE REQUIRES IS THEIR NON ALL TROUBLED NON REVOCABLE. BUT THE REPAIRS WILL ONLY BE ON THE HOOD HOOK TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE'S A DEFAULT. RIGHT YOU NEED TO HAVE TO THE FALL RIGHT JUST BECAUSE YOU SECURITIZED IF THE I. O. U. CONTINUES TO PAY. IT'S NOT THE RIGHT. THE SECURITIZATION IN ESSENCE REMOVES FROM THE UTILITIES CALCULATION THAT DEBT BECAUSE IT IS ASSIGNED TO RATE PAYERS -- RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT RECEIVE YOUR FUNDING ON THE CAMPBELL THE D. W. R. BONDS ARE STILL SHOWING UP ON THE PART OF OUR RESOURCES BONDS FROM THE TWO THOUSAND BANKRUPTCIES ARE STILL SHOWING UP AS A LINE ITEM ON UTILITY BILLS [inaudible] OKAY. LET'S OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING THIS IS THE PUBLIC ADVOCATE OFFICE WE HAVE TWO MATTERS ISSUE NUMBER TWENTY THREE ON THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION PROGRAM ISSUE NUMBER. TWENTY FOUR ON THE WHEEL WHILE FIRE PREVENTION. AND RECOVERY WERE. GOING TO HOLD BOTH BATTERS OPEN. HI IZABELLA GONZALEZ WITH THE NATURE CONSERVANCY IN SUPPORT OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FOR ISSUE TWENTY FOUR WE THANK YOU. CLOSE TO PUBLIC. HEARING THANK THE PO A AND MOVE THE PART C. OF OUR HEARING TODAY THIS IS. THE PART WHEN A FORCE AND FIRE PROTECTION WILDFIRE PREVENTION RECOVERY [inaudible] THE LOU OF BILLS. ISSUE NUMBER. ONE REPORTER GOOD AFTERNOON. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN -- TOM PORTER CAL FIRE -- DIRECTOR. AND REGARDING -- WILDFIRE PREVENTION AND RECOVERY A B. C. P. YOUR PART SEE ITEM ONE OUR ISSUE. ONE CAL FIRE IS REQUESTING -- TEN MILLION DOLLARS GREENHOUSE GAS FUNDING -- AND TWENTY FOUR POSITIONS TO IMPLEMENT -- THE THE NEW PROGRAMS THAT WILL BE UNDER S. B. NINE OH ONE THE S. B.. TWELVE SIXTY AB TWENTY FIVE EIGHTEEN AND A B.. TWENTY NINE ELEVEN THE THE A MEETS THE EYE OF THE REQUESTS OF CAL FIRE. AND DUE TO THE LENGTH OF TODAY'S. HEARING THAT YOU HAD SO FAR -- RATHER THAN -- TRY TO IDENTIFY ALL OF ALL OF YOUR QUESTIONS IN MY WRIST OF MY OPENING. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT -- I ANSWER SPECIFIC QUESTIONS FROM YOU AND AND YOUR MEMBERS. ON THE COMMITTEE -- IN TOTAL. THE CAL FIRE REQUEST EMPHASIZES -- I CONTINUED -- FIREPROOF HEY I CONTINUED CAPABILITY AND OUR FIRE PREVENTION SERVICES WITH THE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES NEEDED THROUGH THIS REQUEST. TO FULFILL THE ASPECTS OF THE FIRE PREVENTION -- THAT WILL BE NEEDED -- AND MAINTAINED UNDER THESE PROVISIONS -- AND THOSE ELEMENTS OF REDUCING -- THE RISK TO LIFE PROPERTY AND THE ENVIRONMENT -- WITH THAT THAT'S THE CLOSE OF MY OPENING AND I AM. YEAH. BACK TO YOU OUR YOUNG. THIS COMPUTERS WITH A L. A. L.. AND SO A AS YOU KNOW THE LEGISLATURE PASSED A COMPREHENSIVE PACKAGE OF BILLS LAST YEAR THE BUDGET INCLUDES AS DOCTOR PORTER INDICATED TEN MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FRIEND OF FOUR CAL FIRE. IT ALSO INCLUDES ANOTHER TWO HUNDRED MILLION I'M FROM THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FAN AS REQUIRED BY S. B.. NINE OH ONE YOU CAN KIND OF THINK ABOUT THAT AS YOUR YOUR WHOLE PACKAGE OFFENDING I'M FOR THIS ITEM. AND THAT WE WE WOULD KNOW IS THAT THE BUDGET PROPOSALS ARE GENERALLY CONSISTENT WITH THE LEGISLATION -- IT HOWEVER THE LEGISLATION AS IT OFTEN DOES I'M A YOU KNOW PROVIDES A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF FLEXIBILITY TO THE ADMINISTRATION -- TO SET UP AND ESTABLISH ARE THESE NEW PROGRAMS IN MANY CASES THESE ARE BRAND NEW PROGRAMS. AND SO AND THEN THERE'S ADDITIONAL DETAILS AND ROOM FOR OVERSIGHT WE THINK -- WITH THESE BUDGET PROPOSALS BOTH AND YET TODAY I KNOW IT'S GETTING LATE AND YOU KNOW IT BUT THROUGH THIS BUDGET PROCESS -- AS WELL AS ON GOING AND SO WE DID HIGHLIGHT SIMON WHAT WE THINK ARE SOME KEY OVERSIGHT QUESTION SO. IF I COULD JUST BRIEFLY GO THROUGH THEM IN TERMS OF THESE PROPOSALS AND WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT APPROVING FOR THE NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET. AND WE THINK THAT THERE'S THERE'S SOME KEY QUESTIONS RELATED TO THAT THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR G. G. R. F. PIECE HAS TWO COMPONENTS FIRST IS A HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE MILLION FOR FOREST HEALTH. AND FIRE PREVENTION GRANTS AND THAT WE'VE HAD TO HAD DISCUSSIONS WITH CAL FIRE ABOUT HOW THEY PLAN TO ALLOCATE THOSE GRANT FRIENDS BETWEEN SORT OF THREE DIFFERENT BUCKETS THERE'S PROJECTS CAL FIRE IS GOING TO UNDERTAKE THEMSELVES. THERE IS -- GRANTS FOR FOREST HEALTH PROJECTS THESE ARE SORT OF LARGER AREAS OF LAND WERE TRYING TO MAKE THE FIRST HEALTHY -- THROUGH A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT THINGS REPLANTING PRESCRIBED BURNS -- PAST ABATEMENT THAT SORT OF THING AND THEN THERE'S THE FIRE PREVENTION GRANTS WHICH TENDS TO BE MORE AND FUEL BREAKS OR MAYBE SOME TARGETED I'M FUELS REDUCTION AROUND COMMUNITIES AND SO THEY'RE THEY'RE DOING DIFFERENT THINGS ALL OF THEM ARE IMPORTANT. ABOUT UNDERSTANDING HOW THEY'RE SETTING THOSE PRIORITIES FOR A HOW MUCH MONEY GOES INTO EACH OF THOSE BUCKETS WITHIN THAT HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE MILLION AS WELL AS HOW WITHIN THAT THEY'RE PRIORITIZING HOUSE THERE -- INSURING THAT DIFFERENT PROJECTS THAT THEY'RE DOING THROUGH DIFFERENT PROGRAMS ARE BEING DONE IN A AND A COLLABORATIVE MANNER TO GET THE BIGGEST BANG FOR THE BUCK. THAT'S ONE OF THE QUESTIONS WE WE HAVE. YOU HAVE. NOW SUPERIMPOSES STATE OF EMERGENCY THE SET CHANGE YOUR ANALYSIS OF OF THESE THE DIFFERENT. CATEGORIES IN OVER SAME MEAN WE NEED TO GO QUICKLY AND IT'S IN THE SUMMER TO SEE HOW. TODAY IS THE WORD DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE BUT THAT'S A QUESTION THAT'S COME UP SINCE YOU KNOW WE FIRST EVALUATED THE BUDGET PROPOSAL IS WHERE IS THE FUNDING GOING TO COME FROM TO TO HANDLE THAT THIRTY FIVE PROJECTS IDENTIFIED IN -- WHAT'S BEEN REFERRED TO AS THE FORTY FIVE DAY REPORT. AND AND WILL IT COME FROM. THE FINDING HERE IT SOUNDS LIKE SOME OF THEM IS POSSIBLY COMING FROM FINDING THOSE PROVIDED IN THE CURRENT YEAR -- WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT HOW THAT RELATES BACK TO THE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR PACKET? I'M PROBABLY THE FIRE PREVENTION GRANTS OR THE PROJECTS BEING DIRECTLY UNDERTAKEN BY CAL FIRE WOULD BE MORE. IN LINE SINCE -- I ATE MY UNDERSTANDING MOST THE PROJECTS ARE FOCUSED ON ON PROTECTING COMMUNITIES IN CONSTRUCTING FEEL BREAKS AND THAT SORT OF THING. BUT THAT'S CERTAINLY GOOD QUESTION AS THIS IS SORT OF AN EVOLVING SITUATION IS HOW HOW DOES THE CHANGES IN THE CURRENT YEAR IMPACT THE FINDING THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT FOR NINETEEN TWENTY AS WELL IS IS IT REDIRECTING FUNDING IN THE CURRENT YEAR. AND IF SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR A FOR THE FOR FINDING IN THE NINETEEN TWENTY IN NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET YEAR AND SO I THINK THOSE ARE GOOD QUESTIONS AND YOU KNOW OVERSIGHT QUESTIONS TO INSURE THAT YOU FULLY UNDERSTAND WHAT ONE WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE CURRENT YEAR INTO WHAT. YOU'RE BEING ASKED TO APPROVE -- FOR NINETEEN TWENTY CONTINUE WHAT YOU'RE. YOUR THOUGHTS THANK YOU MR RECORD THEM IS SO THAT THE SECOND PIECE OF THAT TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IS REQUIRED BY S. B. NINE I WENT IS FOR PRESCRIBED BURN CRUISE. SPECIFICALLY THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS SO CURRENTLY CAL FIRE HAS SIX I BELIEVE PRESCRIBED BURN CRUISE THIS WOULD TAKE THEM UP TO TEN THAT STARTING IN. NINETEEN TWENTY AND THESE DEDICATED PRESCRIBER CREWS ARE RELATIVELY NEW -- CAL FIRE IS STILL IN THE PROCESS OF HIRING UP IN TRAINING THESE CREWS AND SO GETTING A SENSE OF HOW THAT PROCESS HAS GONE AND ARE THERE LESSONS LEARNED AD AND HOW WHAT CAN YOU EXPECT IN TERMS OF HOW QUICKLY THESE CREWS ARE ACTUALLY TO BE. ON THE GROUND I'M GETTING WORK DONE AND WHERE THEY'LL BE LOCATED IN AND AND HOW THEY'LL BE PRIORITIZED AND HOW THEY'LL BE. AND YOU KNOW HOW THE DEPARTMENT CAN ENSURE THAT THEY DON'T GET JUST PULLED INTO FIRE SUPPRESSION WORK AND AND YOU KNOW THAT THEY CAN PROTECT THE MISSION OF THOSE CREWS -- AND SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE IMPORTANT OVERSIGHT QUESTIONS I HAVE ANOTHER ONE FOR THE CURRENT THE CURRENT. BUDGET THAT YOU'RE LOOKING ON THE NINETEEN TWENTY YEAR. I'M ASKING I KNOW ONE REQUIRES CAL FIRE TO ESTABLISH A WILDFIRE RESILIENCE PROGRAM SO THERE IS A FINDING THAT IS INCLUDED AND IN THE BUDGET FOR THE PROGRAM AND AND AND BLINKING ON THE AMOUNT RIGHT NOW BUT THERE. AND BY PROGRAM BUT IT'S UNCLEAR HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE SERVED. PACIFIC STAFFING LEVELS THAT THEY'VE IDENTIFIED AS WE THINK THERE'S SOME SOME OVERSIGHT QUESTIONS THERE JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT WHAT WHAT'S BEEN APPROVED AND THE LEVEL AND THAT THAT PROGRAM IS BEING INITIATED THAT REALLY MATCHES WITH WHAT THE LEGISLATURE'S INTENT WAS. IN REQUIRING THEM TO CREATE THIS PROGRAM AND THIS IS SEPARATE AND DISTINCT FROM THE PRESCRIBED BURN OR THE HEALTHY -- FORCE THIS IS THE RESILIENCE PIECE OF CORRECT IN THIS PROGRAM IS ESSENTIALLY I AM AT THE SET UP AND I CAN LET THE MINISTRATION SPEAK TO IT BETTER -- BUT TO TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO SMALLER LANDOWNERS -- AND HELP THEM SORT OF THROUGH THE REGULATORY PROCESS SO IT'S IT'S ANOTHER PIECE OF SORT OF SUPPORTING THAT BIGGER PICTURE BUT IT IS A SEPARATE PEACE AND AND SO THAT THE BUDGET INCLUDES FUNDING AND STAFFING TO GET THIS PROGRAM OFF THE GROUND BUT IT'S A LITTLE BIT UNCLEAR WHY. THAT LEVEL AND EXACTLY HOW MANY LANDOWNERS DUE TO THE ENVISION BEING ABLE TO HELP AND AND WHAT'S THE MAGNITUDE OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THEY FEEL. THEY CAN PROVIDE AND AND HOW MIGHT THAT AFFECT OUTCOMES -- OF THE PROGRAM AND SO THERE'S PROBABLY SOME MORE ROOM THERE FOR YOU TO GET INFORMATION ON THAT AND MAKE SURE JUST LINES UP WITH IS THIS WHAT YOU THOUGHT YOU WERE PROVING WHEN YOU PASSED AS BEING I KNOW. ONE AND SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE NEAR TERM QUESTIONS WE HAVE SOME THAT RELATE TO TO SOME OF THE OTHER PROGRAMS TO AND AND THERE'S A LOT OF ISSUES IN THE UTILITY SIDE BUT I WON'T GO INTO THAT BECAUSE THAT'S NOT PART OF THIS ITEM. AND WE ALSO THINK THAT THIS AND THIS TOPIC AND JUST OVERSIGHT OF THE LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE IS SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO REQUIRE A LOT OF LONG TERM OVERSIGHT. AND THE LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE IT AS BEING I NO ONE IN PARTICULAR IS YOU NOW IS FOCUSING ON FOREST HEALTH FORSTER BECOME HEALTHY IN ONE BUDGET YEAR THEY DON'T BECOME HEALTHY FROM ONE APPROPRIATION OF FINES OR WHEN GRANT CYCLE. SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO TAKE -- A VERY LONG TIME AND SO I WE DO HE WE DO HIGHLIGHT SAM SAM -- QUESTIONS OVERSIGHT QUESTIONS FOR YOU THERE AND HOW IS THE ADMINISTRATION MEASURING OUTCOMES. YOU KNOW OUR OUR FORESTS HEALTHIER AT HOW HOW DO YOU DEFINE WHEN THEY'RE HEALTHY. AND AND HOW RE MEASURING OUTCOMES HARRY MEASURING OUTCOMES OVER TIME IS -- WAITED YOU KNOW LINK BACK TO MAKING OUR FIRST HEALTHIER WITH WILD FIRES BEING LESS SEVERE AND THESE ARE NOT EASY THINGS AND TO BE ABLE TO TRACK THE OUTCOME SIGNED THERE'S NO OBVIOUS -- WAY TO DO IT BUT THAT SOMETHING THAT OVER TIME WE THINK YOU'RE GONNA WANT TO CONTINUE TO SUPPRESS ADMINISTRATION ON IN QUESTION. HOW ARE WE DOING THIS TO ENSURE THAT THE FUNDS ARE BEING USED EFFECTIVELY -- THE SIMILAR LIVE THERE BEING FUNDS ARE BEING ALLOCATED TO THE HIGHEST PRIORITY AREAS AND GEOGRAPHICALLY PROTECTING COMMUNITIES WHERE WE HAVE SEVERE VIRUS. I'M NOT LOOKING INTO ARE THERE BARRIERS TO CAMP. TO COMPETING I'M SORRY TO COMPLETING ANY OF THESE PROJECTS AND WE'VE HEARD. ANECDOTALLY A LOT OF CONCERNS ABOUT WORK FORCE BEING INSUFFICIENT THAT THERE'S NOT EVEN WHEN YOU START GIVING OUT THE GRANTS THAT THERE'S NOT ENOUGH AND YOU KNOW -- QUALIFIED CONTRACTORS OUR LABORS TO ACTUALLY DO THIS WORK I AND THAT AT SOME POINT ARE WE GONNA RUN INTO THAT AS A BEER YOU'RE INTO THAT SORT OF AN ON GOING LONGER TERM QUESTION. I'M A FOUR FOUR WE THINK FOR YOU TO ASK THE MINISTRATION. I'M AND THEN OUT COMES FROM TIMBER HARVESTING AND EXEMPTIONS AND OUTCOMES FOR PRESCRIBED BURNS AND AND WE HAVE WE HAVE OTHER QUESTIONS HERE BUT THAT JUST GIVES YOU KIND OF A FLAVOR THAT. REALLY YOU THERE'S A LOT OF DETAIL THAT YOU MAY WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU APPROVE THESE NINETEEN TWENTY PROPOSALS AND THEN THAT'S SORT OF NOT THE END OF IT THEY'RE STILL A WHOLE LOT OF QUESTIONS FOR YOU. I'M IN YOUR ONGOING OVERSIGHT OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS PACKAGE. WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE WORK FORCE THAT I KNOW PART OF THE EMERGENCY ORDER WAS FIFTY MILLION FOR PUBLIC OUT REGION AND MODERNIZATION? I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS FEBRUARY I I THINK I KNOW WHAT IT IS BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT. SPECIFIC WOULD BE WITH IS THAT. PART OF THE THE OVERSIGHT WE SHOULD HAVE ALSO AS FAR AS WHAT THAT WOULD BE A WITH THAT MODERNIZATION. AND SURE I MEAN I THINK TO THE EXTENT THAT AS PART OF THE EXECUTIVE ORDER AND IS PART OF THE FORTY FIVE DAY REPORT. I'M THE ADMINISTRATION IS EITHER AND READ DIRECT STAYING UP FOR AND MAYBE REFOCUSING FRIENDS THAT HAVE BEEN PROVIDED IN THE CURRENT YEAR. AND THAT YOU ABSOLUTELY WANT TO BE ASKING THOSE QUESTIONS AND UNDERSTANDING WHAT'S HAPPENING YOU KNOW THE THE THE FUNDS THAT WERE PROVIDED IN THE CURRENT YEAR BUDGET WERE PROVIDED FOR SPECIFIC PURPOSE AND SO UNDERSTANDING IF THERE'S CHANGES THERE AND AND TO WHAT EXTENT THOSE ARE BEING MADE AND AND WHAT. EXACTLY IS BEING DONE I THINK IS AND ENTIRELY CLEAR AND SO THOSE ARE DEFINITELY I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF QUESTIONS AND THAT STILL REMAIN REGARDING THAT. THE EMERGENCY ORDER AND THE FORTY FIVE DAY REPORT AND EXACTLY HOW THAT'S GOING TO BE ACCOMPLISHED AND HOW THAT AFFECTS BOTH YOUR CURRENT YOUR BUDGET AND THAT. NINETEEN TWENTY FINANCE GOOD BEFORE WE GET BACK TO THE DOCTOR A PORTER. ALLISON YOUR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THAT WANT TO JUST MAKE ONE CLARIFICATION ON THE FIFTY MILLION THAT. AND I WANT TO ALSO DEFER TO MY COUNTERPARTS ON THAT CAL O. YES ASSIGNMENT OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES SO THAT THE FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS WAS PROVIDED. FOR HELLO YES PART OF THE AND AND THEY'LL BE SOME COLLABORATION WITH CALIFONE TEARS AS WELL BUT SO THEY THEY WOULD BE THE TRUE EXPERTS AND WE'D BE ABLE TO TALK ABOUT THAT BUT THERE WAS FUNDING ALLOCATED IN THE CURRENT YEAR. I'M FOR THE ACTIVITIES THAT ARE DESCRIBED HOWEVER IN TERMS OF ANY REDIRECTION OF RESOURCES I DO WANT TO DEFER TO THEM -- I CAN SPEAK MORE WE CAN SPEAK MORE TO THE CAL FIRE PIECE OF THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL -- BUT DO YOU WANT TO JUST SAY IN TERMS OF THAT A SPECIFIC DOLLAR AMOUNTS -- AND THAT SORT OF STATEMENTS AROUND THAT THAT WOULD BE IN FOR OUR GUESTS THE DIRECTOR PORTER WHERE WE'VE GOT A SUGGESTION THAT THE WORK FORCE OF WE GIVE WE GIVE MONEY TO WHICH I'VE BEEN. ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT GETTING THE PRIVATE SECTOR INVOLVED IN DOING SOME OF THE THE WORK ON THE IN THE FORCE THAT THERE'S NOT ENOUGH. LUMBERJACKS OUT THERE I DON'T THINK IT'S CALLED LUMBERJACKS NOW BUT WHATEVER THEY'RE CALLED -- AND RELATED TO THAT -- WE WE HAVE NOT YET. COME TO A POINT WHERE WE'VE EXHAUSTED THE THE FOREST WORKERS WITH THE GRANT PROGRAMS THAT WE CURRENTLY -- ARE ARE PUTTING OUT -- ON THE GROUND AND SO THAT WOULD BE THE THE GREENHOUSE GAS AND THEN PREVIOUS TO THAT THE S. R. S. R. A. -- FOR FUND THAT YOU WERE MENTIONING EARLIER -- THIS MORNING -- IS SO SO THAT IS PART OF THE THE THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION WE DO BELIEVE THAT THERE IS ROOM FOR ADDITIONAL WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT IN IN THIS SECTOR THE FOREST -- WORKER SECTOR OF THE FUNDS THAT ARE RELATED TO THIS DON'T SPECIFICALLY GO TO THAT TYPE OF OF OPPORTUNITY BUT WE ARE LOOKING AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY -- TO TO WORK WITH THE CONTRACTORS THAT ARE CALIFORNIA CONTRACTORS ON THESE PROJECTS -- AND HELP THEM -- TO DEVELOP THOSE WORKFORCES. OKAY MEMBERS HAVE QUESTIONS. LET'S START MY RIGHT CENTER STERN. NAME IS SURE EACH REPORTER FOR BEING HERE IN. HOW TO MANAGE THIS? HUGE STRATEGY GUIDE TO EXECUTE ON BECAUSE I WANT TO DRILL DOWN A LITTLE BIT ON THE POINTS THE LA -- RAISE AND GET YOUR REACTION TO IT. SPECIFICALLY. THE METRIC THAT I'M INTERESTED IN [inaudible] IS [inaudible] PEOPLE -- HOW SAFE? ARE THE MOST NUMBER OF PEOPLE GOING TO BE SO WHEN I THINK OF LIKE I WE I WAS JUST TRYING TO DO SOME ROUGH MATH A LOOKING AT SORT OF THE AFFECTED POPULATION. MATTHEW GUYS USED TO TO GO THROUGH YOUR YOUR PRIORITY FUEL REDUCTION PROJECTS FOR INSTANCE AND LOOKING AT THAT. FIRST CUT OF THE COMMUNITY WILDFIRE IN MITIGATION REPORT. AND I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED THAT WE KEEP THIS CALLING IT FOREST WORK FORCE RESTORATION. FORREST. THE MANDATE IS ABOUT FIRE RISK REDUCTION AND SO. THE MOVIE IS NOT JUST IN THE FOREST. AND YOU LOOK AT CHAPARRAL AND ALL THESE OTHER ECOSYSTEMS THAT. THROUGHOUT SAN DIEGO. ALL THE ALL THE SOUTH LAND INLAND EMPIRE WE'VE HAD PLENTY OF INCIDENTS ALL THROUGHOUT NON FOREST AREAS WHERE. BUT YOU KNOW IN THE WILL OF THE WE JUST BURNED DOWN THERE ARE NO FORCE. OR WHAT I WOULD CALL FORCE IN THE SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS IN THE SAME WAY SO. I WANT TO GET YOUR THOUGHTS ON WHETHER YOU'RE WEDDED TO THE EXISTING METRICS THAT YOU'RE USING THAT SORT OF TAKE THAT SORT OF MORE TRADITIONAL LOOK AT SAY. VALUING THE THE BIG THREE SIDE OF THINGS AND SORT OF WAITING THAT EQUAL TO PEOPLE AND YOU KNOW I I RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF FORESTRY HEALTH TO DRIVE ALL THIS BUT I GUESS. I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PRIORITIZE THE THE THESE NEW POPULATIONS AND MAYBE IN THE PAST WE WOULDN'T I THOUGHT HAD THAT INTERFACE BUT IT CAN YOU COMMENT A LITTLE BIT ON THE CURRENT METRICS YOU'RE USING AND AND IS SORT OF WHAT THE DRIVING STRATEGIES GONNA BE. GOING FORWARD -- AROUND THIS OLD SORT OF WILDFIRE RESILIENCE PROGRAM. SURE. I THANK YOU SENATOR FOR THAT QUESTION -- WE WE WE REALLY ARE LOOKING AT THIS IN IN. DIFFERENT WAYS AND I'M A I'M A SPLIT THIS -- TO FORCED RESILIENCE AND AND FOREST HEALTH -- AS ONE BASKET AND THEN THE OTHER BASKET IS -- WILD FIRE PREVENTION OR FIRE PREVENTION -- AND ON THE FIRE PREVENTION -- THAT PIECE OF THIS IS IS REALLY GEARED TOWARD -- PROTECTING LIVES AND PROPERTY. AS THE FIRST. ORDER OF BUSINESS NOW WITH THE WORK THAT WE'RE GONNA BE DOING IN THOSE AREAS AND THAT COULD BE AND THANK YOU FOR POINTING OUT THE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CHAPARRAL LANDSCAPE AND THE AND THE TRADITIONAL FOREST LANDSCAPE -- BECAUSE THEY ARE DIFFERENT AND WE NEED -- TO ADDRESS THOSE DIFFERENCES IN BOTH IN OUR LAND MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES BUT ALSO IN THE THE COMMUNITY PROTECTION ELEMENT. SO WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DOING -- OVER THE FIRE PREVENTION TYPE OF WORK IN -- IN A CHAPARRAL LANDSCAPE THAT THAT'S GONNA INCLUDE NOT ONLY THE DEFENSIBLE SPACE AROUND THE THE IMMEDIATE STRUCTURES IN COMMUNITIES IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE INTENSITY OF FIRE AS IT COMES TO A STRUCTURE -- AND IN INCREASES THE SURVIVABILITY OF THE STRUCTURE AND THE PEOPLE WHO MAY BE INSIDE OF IT -- BUT ALSO REDUCING THE INTENSITY OF FIRE AS IT COMES ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE FOR INSTANCE IN THE WALLS THE FIRE WHERE IT BURNS IN SIX HOURS FROM THE FREEWAY AND WON A ONE TO THE BEACH -- AND ALL THE HOMES THAT WERE IN BETWEEN THERE -- WE NEED TO REDUCE THE INTENSITY AS IT GETS TO WHERE THE HOMES ARE AND AND THAT -- THEN THE DEFENSIBLE SPACE IN THE HOME HARDENING WILL HELP. US TO PROTECT LIVES AND PROPERTY -- EVERY SINGLE LIFE. AND EVERY SINGLE PROPERTY -- TO US IS WORTH THE SAME. IT'S IT MUST BE SAVED AT EVERY WEEK WE WILL TAKE EVERY PRECAUTION WE CAN TO DO THAT -- AND THEN THE MORE A FOREST -- FORCE MANAGEMENT AND AND FOR OUR OUR TRULY ARE CARBON GOALS AND PROTECTING THOSE LARGE TREES THAT WE WANT TO PROTECT FOR GENERATIONS TO COME -- THAT'S WHERE WE GET INTO THE MORE THE LANDSCAPE LEVEL -- PROGRAM WORK AND THE AND THE THE THE PROJECTS THAT ARE MORE TRADITIONAL LUMBERJACK TYPE PROJECTS -- CHAIR WE DO STILL USE THAT ON OCCASION. DID YOU ACTUALLY YOU MENTION HOME HARDENING DO YOU ANTICIPATE THAT BEING PART OF THE SCOPE OF WORK WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE FIRE PREVENTION SIDE DO YOU DO YOU GO JUST TO THE EDGE OF THE HOME OR IS SOME OF THIS WORK FORCE IT'S GOING TO GO OUT AND DO. THIS YOU KNOW WE WENT THROUGH A LOT -- OVERSIGHT HEARING AID CENTER WIRE AND I HELD JOINTLY ABOUT. YOU KNOW A LOT OF THE SIMPLE THINGS THAT HOMEOWNERS CAN BE DOING TO PREVENT THEMSELVES AND BURNING DOWN ANYTHING FROM SCREENING ON YOUR EAVES OR THE GAS GETTING ON YOUR YOU KNOW IN YOUR GARAGE LIKE THOSE THOSE STARTED. PRETTY LOW COST BUT TOUGH INTERVENTION SOMETIMES TO GET PRIVATE HOMEOWNERS TO TO GO THROUGH AS YOU AND JUST BEING THAT WITHIN THE SCOPE WORD OR IS THAT A IS THAT A SEPARATE. BUCKET THAT THAT THAT'S THAT'S A GREAT SEGUE SENATOR TO ARRIVE WE ARE NOT PROPOSING MONEY FOR IN IN THIS IN THIS PIECE OF THE BUDGET WE'RE NOT PROPOSING ANY GOOD MONEY FOR THOSE TYPES OF ACTIVITIES. HOWEVER -- I DO WANT TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY AND WE WILL TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY THROUGH THE OUTREACH AND EDUCATION PORTIONS OF THIS IN CONJUNCTION WITH -- CALLOW YES AND AND THAT PIECE -- THAT WE'RE JUST TALKING ABOUT A FEW MINUTES AGO -- TO PROMOTE OUR READY FOR A WILD FIRE HAPPEN AS ONE OF THE PLACES THAT PEOPLE CAN GO AND HAVE AN INTERACTIVE -- WAY OF OF DOING THEIR THEIR PART OF THEIR HOME HARDENING -- AND TRACKING. YOU TWO REALLY I GET THEM OUT IN THE THE PUBLIC REGULAR VERNACULAR WHEN TALKING ABOUT THIS IS JUST. IT'S BEEN SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN STRUGGLING WITH AND THIS IS GOING TO GIVE US THAT OPPORTUNITY. SO THE THE HOME HARDENING AT LEAST EDUCATION TO DOWNLOAD AN APP ON THE OUTREACH AND EDUCATION SIDE NOT SO MUCH IN HERE. BUT NO ACTUAL INCENTIVES FOR THE OR INCENTIVES OR EVEN -- WORK FORCE DEDICATED TO THAT ACTUAL INTERACTION WITH THE HOMEOWNER TO UNDERTAKE A PROJECT LIKE WHAT WE'RE SHOULD THAT LEAVE LEAVE IF NOT WITH YOU IS THAT IS THAT MORE APPROPRIATE FOR SAY A GRANT. TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS YOU HAVE THIS GRANT MAKING AUTHORITY IS IS THERE THE FLEXIBILITY MAYBE IN THAT POT TO BE ABLE. TO BECAUSE IT'S ONE THING TO SAY DOWNLOAD THE APP AND AND RECOGNIZE THE RISK IT'S ANOTHER TO SAY LIKE GO HIGHER CONTRACTOR AND DO -- FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR PROJECT -- THOUSAND DOLLAR PROJECT ON YOUR HOME WE HAVE I DON'T KNOW. LIKE TWO MILLION HOMES PROBABLY TO COVER I YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S A BIG TASK AND SO. ARE WE JUST WE GOT TO SEE MOVEMENT ON IT THIS YEAR AND I I THINK SETTING UP SOME METRICS. THAT THAT WE'RE REALLY GING TO DEDICATE OURSELVES PEOPLE CALIFORNIA TO SAY YOU KNOW WE ARE GOING TO TRY TO GET. TO X. NUMBER OF COMMUNITIES ARE EX NUMBER OF HOMES BY ECTASY -- TO NOT ONLY PROTECT IT WITH FUEL BREAKS IN THE HABITAT AND ALL THE SORT OF ISSUES AROUND SPEED AND AND SORT OF INTENSITY. BUT AT THAT HOME ITSELF THERE'S ONLY I MEAN THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH YOU CAN DO OUT IN THE FOREST. RIGHT I MEAN WE KNOW THAT A LOT OF THAT WORK ACTUALLY HAPPENS. RIGHT AT THE HOME RIGHT AT THAT WE WE INTERFACE SO WE'RE TALKING TO THE WE THE WRONG AGENCY HERE IS THAT SOMETHING THAT THROUGH YOUR EXPERTISE I MEAN WE WANT YOU TO BE THE STRATEGIC PLANNER WE REALLY WANT YOU. TO TO HELP COORDINATE ALL THAT BUT I DON'T KNOW I DON'T WANT TO FORCE A ROUND PEG INTO A SQUARE HOLE BUT THIS WORLD. NEEDS TO BE FILLED IN. THOSE ARE GREAT OWN -- IT ACTUALLY -- DOES ALLOW US TO GET INTO THE DEFENSIBLE SPACE ON OUR LAND USE PLANNING -- AND CODE OF KIND OF DEVELOPMENT PEACE THROUGH THE FIRE MARSHAL'S OFFICE DOES GET US TO HARDENING OF STRUCTURES. PRIMARILY. STRUCTURES THAT DON'T EXIST TODAY. THOSE ARE THE STRUCTURES THAT ARE BEING BUILT IN THE FUTURE -- WHEN WE GET -- TO IS THE THE PIECE OF OF RETRO FITTING AND AND CONVERTING -- COULD EXISTING NON CONFORMING WE CALL THEM -- STRUCTURES -- THAN THOSE THOSE ARE THE TIMES WHERE WE ARE IN A A PLACE WHERE WE NEED TO WORK WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT LOCAL PLANNING AGENCY TYPES -- AND OTHERS TO HELP INCENTIVIZE -- THAT ACTIVITY. YOU CAN DO THAT WITH THIS MONEY CAN'T. NOT WITH THE MONEY THAT'S PROPOSED UNDER THIS P. IS THERE ANY MONEY IN THE ENTIRE BUDGET TO DO THAT. THAT KIND OF WORK DO WE KNOW. YEAH THEY ARE YOU IN IN IN MY BUDGET NO NO. DID YOU TELL YOU I MISS HER TO GO OUTSIDE OF THIS PART DO YOU KNOW IF THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE WHERE I'M NOT NO I DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE AND NOT TO OUR KNOWLEDGE THAT WOULD ADDRESS THAT REALLY WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING OUT THE FUNDING -- TO ADDRESS WILDFIRES IT'S IN THE BUDGET YOU HAVE AND THIS PIECE WHICH IS ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE MILLION MOST DIVIDING CAL FIRE WHICH IS REALLY IT'S FOCUSED. SOLELY ON IMPLEMENTATION OF SB NINE A ONE AND THE OTHER PACKAGE OF BILLS AND REALLY JUST A SETTING UP THE PROGRAMS THAT WERE REQUIRED THERE THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR ALLOCATION THAT WAS REQUIRED BY SB NINE I WENT AND SO. REALLY FOCUSED ON ON JUST IMPLEMENTATION OF THOSE BILLS IT DOESN'T GO OUT SIDE THAT -- WHERE THE GVERNOR DOES ADD ADDITIONAL FUNDING IN IS THAT NINETY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS AND THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT I THINK LAST WEEK OR TWO WEEKS AGO -- FOR THE ENHANCED AND FIRE RESPONSE CAPACITY AND SO THAT'S FIRE TRUCKS AND THEY SEE -- ONE THIRTY TANKERS SO THAT'S REALLY WHERE THE GOVERNOR IS TAKING SOMETHING ABOVE AND BEYOND EXISTING LAW AND ADDING AN ADDITIONAL FUNDING. AND SO I THINK AS WE TALKED ABOUT A COUPLE WEEKS AGO YOUR I THINK JUST YOU KNOW FOR THIS COMMITTEE AND FOR THE LEGISLATURE AS A WHOLE AND WHEN YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT WHERE YOU WANT TO ADD RESOURCES. TO ADDRESS WILDFIRE ISSUES AND THAT GO ABOVE AND BEYOND WHAT'S REQUIRED IN THE LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE DO YOU WANT THAT ALL ON THE FIRE IS SUPPRESSION RESPONSE SIDE WITH -- EQUIPMENT AND STAFF THAT CERTAINLY IMPORTANT -- DO YOU WANT SOME FUNDING FOR ADDITIONAL THINGS I'M TO ADDRESS YOU KNOW HOME HARDENING. OR OTHER ISSUES AND HOW DO YOU STRUCTURE THAT HOW DO YOU CREATE INCENTIVES AND AND HOW DO YOU SET THAT THE BUDGET DOESN'T GO THERE RIGHT NOW BUT CERTAINLY AS YOU THINK ABOUT PUTTING TOGETHER THIS PACKAGE AND WHERE YOUR PRIORITIES ARE. AND YOU KNOW YOU YOU CAN MOVE THINGS AROUND FROM FROM WHERE AT THE GOVERNOR'S PLACE STATE YOU CAN YOU KNOW. DO MORE OR LESS YOU CAN IT'S A PARTNERSHIP. WE WANTED ALL. CENTER MONEY YOU HAD A QUESTION. THANK YOU YEAH MAYBE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. MAY FIRST TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT. WE LIVE IN A RURAL AREA. CYPRESS FIRE DISTRICT SERVED BY CAL FIRE EVERY YEAR THEY COME BY THEY DO A DIAGNOSTIC ON THE HOUSE WHEN THEY'RE NOT OUT FIGHTING FIRES. IN THEY GIVE YOU A CHECKLIST BASED ON THEIR OBSERVATIONS SO UNDER EXISTING BUDGETS THERE SOME. HOME SURVEILLANCE IN THIS INTERFACE -- THAT DOES LEAD TO MY QUESTION AND I THINK YOU PARTIALLY ANSWER THIS. I LIKE THE MANTRA THAT EVERY LIFE IN EVERY PROPERTY IS VALUED EQUALLY THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. WITH THAT MANTRA IN COMMITMENT. WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE RISK WE FACE IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW? WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE ENTIRE STATE MAP? IN YOU'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT DEPLOYMENT OF RESOURCES UNDER. THESE BUDGET ITEMS AN EXISTING. BUDGETS. DO YOU HAVE A PRIORITIZATION OF HIGH RISK AREAS WHERE YOU ARE. PUTTING RESOURCES IN ANTICIPATION [inaudible] OF ARE COMING FIRE SEASON. THANK YOU SENATOR MONEY -- SO IF THE ANSWER IS IS YES AND NO TO THAT -- BECAUSE CERTAIN PIECES OF OF OF THIS PROPOSAL AND OTHERS -- THAT YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THIS BUDGET CYCLE -- OUR STATEWIDE IN NATURE OR REGIONAL IN NATURE -- AND THEY WILL BE COMING AND GOING TO THOSE PLACES THAT NEED THE WORK OR NEED THE THE ANALYSIS -- SPECIFICALLY -- THE ANSWER THE THE YES PART OF THAT ANSWER IS -- WHERE WE GET -- TO DEPLOYMENT OF LET'S SAY THE THIRTEEN ENGINES THAT WERE WERE WORKING THROUGH -- SO IT SO -- A A AN APPARATUS OR SOMETHING THAT IS YOU NEED TO HAVE A HOME -- WE VERY MUCH ARE LOOKING AT ALL OF THE ITEMS THAT WERE CONSIDERED IN THE FORTY FIVE DAY REPORT -- RELATED TO VULNERABLE VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES AND THE ELEMENTS OF THAT AS WELL AS THE NUMBER OF FIRE STARTS THAT WE'RE HAVING -- SO KIND OF THE DIAGNOSTICS OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS OF OF KIND OF THE HOT BED AREAS OF OF OF WHERE THE ACTIVITY IS -- AND THEN ALSO -- OUR OUR RISK MAPS -- THAT SHOW WHERE -- OUR WILD FIRE RISK IS -- HIGHEST THROUGHOUT THE STATE ALL OF THOSE ELEMENTS ARE BEING UTILIZED TO IDENTIFY SPECIFIC POINTS ON THE GROUND WHERE WE'RE GOING TO PLACE THE INVESTMENTS AND THEN OF COURSE WE HAVE THOSE. THOSE BROADER -- INVESTMENTS AND MY MY TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN STRATEGIC PLAN -- WILL HAVE US -- DEVELOPING AN ANALYSIS -- THAT GOES BEYOND THE THIRTEEN ENGINES GOES BEYOND THE THE BULLDOZER OPERATORS AND HELICOPTERS AND AND AND AIRCRAFT AND AND SHOWS US WHERE WE NEED TO LOOK AT DEPLOYING MORE RESOURCES OR MOVING RESOURCES AROUND THE STATE TO BETTER. SUIT THE NEEDS OF THE S. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU JUST A FINAL QUESTION FAMILY. I RECENTLY VISITED THE CAL POLY FIRE INSTITUTE IN DEVELOPMENT IN LOOKING SPECIFICALLY AT RESIDENTIAL INTERFACE WITH WILD FIRE AREAS. IN DEVELOPMENT THERE OF A PROTECTIVE FIRE RETARDANT NOT SPRAYED FROM PLANES BUT APPLIED ON ROAD SIGNS OF THE QUEST TO GRADE WAS GIVEN AS AN EXAMPLE ELEVEN FIRES. STARTED BY VEHICLE TRAFFIC IN THE LAST TWO YEARS ONE OF THOSE FIRES COST ELEVEN MILLION DOLLARS. TO SUPPRESS. THE PROPOSAL YOU TREAT IT WITH THIS. NEW. ENVIRONMENTALLY SAFE FIRE RETARDANT -- IT LASTS ALL SEASON. NO NO BY -- IMPACTS. IN YOU SAVE THAT RESPONSE TO ELEVEN FIRES CAUSED BY TAR CIGARETTES ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH THAT TECHNOLOGY -- INTERESTING NO I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH THAT SPECIFIC -- I GUESS I WOULD CALL IT A FIRE RETARDANT IT'S IMPLIED YOUR ROAD SIDE -- BUT ALL ALL APPLICATIONS LIKE THAT ARE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO BE LOOKING AT AND WE HAVE A RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM THAT. I'D LIKE TO YOU FINAL THAT INTO TO TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT THANK YOU AND AGAIN. AND JUST TO PITCH IN MY DISTRICT THIS RESEARCH THIS GOING ON BUT IT SOUNDED INNOVATIVE AND COULD BE A GOOD PREVENTION INVESTMENT THANK YOU. EXXONMOBIL WIRE. THANK YOU SO MUCH TO MAKE A QUICK -- MISTER CHAIR -- CHIEF HE SAID A COUPLE OF QUICK ITEMS REGARDS CONTROLLED BURNS. SAAD. UNDER -- PROVIDING AIR RESOURCES BOARD SOME ADDITIONAL DOLLARS OUT WITH IN THIS -- TO BE ABLE TO FOCUS BOTH ON AND REPORTING A MODELING -- IS WELL AS A LINE EFFORTS ANTICIPATED. SO SHOULD WITH A PRESCRIBED BURNS PUNCTURE SHORT OF ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHANGES WE'VE HAD ACROSS THE STATE IS. LOCAL AIR AGENCIES IN -- THEM NOT ALLOWING PRESCRIBED BURNS BECAUSE A SMOKE SO IS THAT CAN HELP THIS BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S STILL SOME DISCONNECT WITH THAT SO IF YOU ALL CAN. TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT. AND SENATOR THANKS FOR BRINGING UP THE THE AIR QUALITY ISSUES THAT WE'VE HAD IN THE PAST -- WE ACTUALLY HAVE MOVED A LONG WAY -- JUST THROUGH -- DISCUSSIONS AND UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER BETTER -- BUT WHAT THIS WHAT THIS PROPOSAL DOES IS THAT IT ALLOWS US TO GET TO A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE TRUE. HEIR IMPACTS ARE RELATED TO PRESCRIBE FIRE BUT THEN ALSO TO BE ABLE TO QUIT THAT BACK TO WHAT THE DIFFERENCE IN THAT BETWEEN BETWEEN THAT PRESCRIBED FIRE AND WILDFIRE IS BECAUSE WILDFIRE -- ISN'T. THEN AND IT IS -- AROUND STRUCTURES ARE MUCH MORE TALKS IT'S BURNING A WHOLE LOT MORE STUFF THAN THAN JUST THE VEGETATION THAT WE ARE HAVE UNDER PRESCRIPTION. I GUESS. QUESTIONS OF SENTENCES. DO YOU BELIEVE IS GOING TO CLOSE THE GAP BECAUSE AGAIN OF THE SAY IN OUR NECK OF THE WOODS WHEN THE BIG SEAN'S WE'VE HAD IS WITH LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS. IN THE ABILITY TO ADVANCE CONTROLLED BURNS -- AND SO. IS THIS GOING. TO ACT MADE GREAT PROGRESS. I'M JUST BEING HONEST WE DID NOT SEE THIS YEAR AT LEAST WITHIN THE GREATER BAY AREA REGION SO WHAT. SO IS SO RELATED TO CLOSING THE GAP I THINK THIS IS GONNA WORK TOWARD CLOSING THE GAP AND I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S GOING TO ACTUALLY CLOSE THE GAP OR NOT UNTIL WE UNTIL WE GET THROUGH THIS. LET'S HEAR FROM FINANCE. I JUST WANT TO MAKE A COUPLE OF COMMENTS ARE JUST ON THIS CONTROLLED BURN I JUST HONESTLY TO THE RESOURCES THAT ARE IN THE BUDGET SO THERE ARE RESOURCES BOTH FOR CAL FIRE AND FOR THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD RELATED TO IMPLEMENTATION OF US. THREE TWELVE SIXTY TWO AS WE TOLD SIXTY REQUIRES THAT THERE BE A SMOKE -- MONITORING INNER QUALITY PROGRAM AND SO JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THOSE RESOURCES THAT ARE THERE BECAUSE AGAIN I THINK THE ADMINISTRATION FEEL STRONGLY ABOUT. IN ORDER TO MOVE THE NEEDLE ESPECIALLY TOWARDS SOME AMBITIOUS TREATMENT GOALS PRESCRIBE INCREASING USE A PRESCRIBED FIRE IS GOING TO BE A KEY TOOL -- IN ACHIEVING THAT I DID ACTUALLY JUST WANT TO GO BACK I AM TO ADDRESS SOME COMMENTS FROM SENATOR STERN'S THEY DIDN'T GET AN OPPORTUNITY TO HOP AND I DIDN'T NO PROBLEM I DID -- JUST WANTED TO SAY A THING. TO IS THIS A A FANTASTIC CONVERSATION IT'S IT'S SOMETHING I'M DEFINITELY -- TO THINK ABOUT I THINK FOR THE RESOURCES THAT ARE IN THE BUDGET I JUST WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT -- THAT REALLY THE RESOURCES THAT ARE IN THAT PARTICULARLY THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION A REALLY FOCUSED AND SORT OF THE THIRTY FIVE PROJECTS THAT ARE IDENTIFIED IN THAT COMMUNITY WILDFIRE PREVENTION AND MITIGATION REPORT -- ARE REALLY FOCUSED ON COMMUNITY LEVEL PROTECTIONS I THINK THERE WILL ALWAYS BE AN INTERPLAY BETWEEN WHAT WE'RE DOING FOR THESE LARGER ACREAGE TREATMENT GOALS. SOME OF WHICH WILL HAVE THAT WE WE IN INTERMIX -- BALZER IMPACT THOSE AREAS AS WELL SO JUST WANT TO FOCUS ON SORT OF THAT THAT THINKING AROUND COMMUNITY LEVEL FIRE PROTECTION WHICH IS REALLY -- YOU KNOW WITHIN THE SCOPE OF COW FIRES MISSION. THANKS FOR THE CLARIFICATION SENDER -- CHOIR. BUT I WILL KICK THE DOG ONE MORE TIME MANY THIS TABLE -- IN REGARDS CONTROL BURN SO. UNDER WHICH PROPOSED WITH THE S. B. TWELVE SIXTY IT'S FOR SMOKE PUNCHING FOR CANCER FORECASTING REPORTING A MODELING TWO OTHER ITEMS IN THERE [inaudible] AND THERE ARE STILL CHALLENGES ON THE GROUND WITH BEING ABLE TO GET THESE BURNS PERMITTED -- THAT REMAINS WHETHER IT'S WITH CAL FIRE OR WITH A FIRE DISTRICT FOR EXAMPLE -- IT'S GREAT THAT WE'RE DOING THE MONITORING FOR CASH REPORTING AGAIN IS GONNA BE A LARGER DISCUSSION BUT THERE THERE ARE. SOME CHALLENGES WITH GETTING THE PERMITTED SURE AND I THINK THEIR RESOURCES BOARD IS HERE AS WELL AS MY COUNTERPART TO THEIR RESOURCES BOARD ASSIGNMENT THAT CAN SPEAK A LITTLE BIT MORE. IN DEPTH TO THE ACTUAL SORT OF MY SMOKE MONETARY AND OUR QUALITY PIECE -- AS WELL AS SOME OF THAT INTERACTION WITH THE LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS IN ADDITION TO SORT OF LIKE HOW FAR WE HAVE TO OFFER BUT CERTAINLY THE GOAL IS. INCREASING USE A PRESCRIBED FIRE MEDIAN SORT OF THE GOALS WITHIN THE FORCE CARBON PLAN AND AND WE HAVE A LINE STAFF RESOURCES -- IN ORDER TO DO THAT -- YOU. THIS BRIEFLY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- IN RESPONSE TO YOUR QUESTION SENATOR MCGUIRE THAT IT THAT THREE POINT FOUR MILLION FOR CARB ON AND THE SMOKE MONITORING INCLUDES TWO MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY -- EACH YEAR FOR THREE YEARS FOR LOCAL ASSISTANCE GRANTS TO LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS AND SO WHEN YOU HAVE AIR BE UP HERE IN A COUPLE OF DISCUSSION ITEMS THAT WOULD BE A GREAT QUESTION TO ASK THEM SPECIFICALLY ON THAT TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN GRANTS. HOW FAR THEY THINK THAT'S GONNA GO -- TO ADDRESSING THESE CONCERNS I THINK THE SENATOR CAN PUT WORDS IN HIS MOUTH BUT IT'S NOT. NO IT'S IT'S DON'T BURN ON TUESDAY BURN ON THURSDAY BECAUSE THE WIND AND ALL THIS OTHER STUFF THAT'S IT THERE'S A THERE'S A FLEXIBILITY VERSUS NOTHING'S HAPPENING BECAUSE WE'RE NOT. ONE AND NOT ATTAINMENT AREA. THIS REALLY QUICKLY AND THE FIFTY MILLION I THINK THE FIFTY MILLION SWEET VERY TARGETED I DON'T EVER WANT THAT WORDS IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE MATH -- IN REGARDS TO THE EXECUTIVE ORDER BUT IT'S GONNA BE FOCUSED MOSTLY ON I THINK FIVE OR SIX COUNTIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE HI FIRAS COUNTIES OF LAKE SHASTA PRESIDENTIAL. RIVERSIDE. THERE'S ONE ADDITIONAL ON A APOLOGIZE IN. IN ADDITION TO THE OP I THINK YOU'RE GONNA BE WORKING WITH NON PROFITS -- WITHIN THESE COUNTIES AS WELL BECAUSE YOU'RE GETTING INFORMATION OUT THERE -- FOR THESE HIGH FIRAS CANCER CARRIES HAD BEEN IMPACTED I I BELIEVE AS WELL WHICH IS GREAT BECAUSE FOLKS NEED TO BECOME PREPARED AND ESPECIALLY ON RECEIVE ACTUATION ROOTS AND WANT TO BE ABLE TO DO. WHEN IN A FIRE STARTED IN THEM AND I? GREATLY APPRECIATE THE FOCUS ON THAT. LAST PIECE IN THE EXECUTIVE ORDER ANDERSON IS THAT WITHIN THIS TODAY BUT THE TWENTY MILLION. IN FORCE MANAGEMENT GRANTED I MEAN MOVING FORWARD. HOW IS THAT GOING TO ANGKOR? CORPORATE WITH WHAT YOU HAVE MOVING WITHIN THE ACTUAL BUDGET ITSELF. IS IT THERE'S TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR A TEN MILLION. SO -- I'M DISORDER HOW THAT'S ALL WE'RE NOT AID YOU MEAN THAT THE TEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE RECENTLY WITH GREAT EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT THERE'S TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN FORCE MANAGEMENT GRANTS THAT ARE GOING TO BE MOVED IN EXPEDITED MANNER. AND SO THAT IS CURRENTLY IN IT IN THIS YEAR'S CURRENT BUDGET. AND THEN WE'RE LOOKING AT ADDITIONAL DOLLARS ARE GOING TO BE MOVING SO I'M SORRY HOW THEY'RE ALL RELATED IN IN ANYTHING DIFFERENT THAT YOU'RE DOING. IN THE EXECUTIVE ORDER VERSUS WHAT IS GONNA BE COMING THROUGH WITH THE BUDGET THIS YEAR SO I I DON'T. SO WITH THE PRIORITY PROJECTS THAT WERE IDENTIFIED IN THE FOUR IN THE SO CALED FORTY FIVE DAY REPORT THOSE WILL BE MOVING FORWARD AND AND CAL FIRE HAS IDENTIFIED THAT THOSE WOULD BE IMMEDIATE TERM. PROJECTS MEETING THOSE WOULD BE DONE IN THE NEXT SIX MONTHS AND SO THAT BOTH OF THOSE PROJECTS THE OUTCOMES THAT WE INTEND WITH THOSE PROJECTS ARE ALIGNED WITH THE RESOURCES THAT HAVE BEEN INCLUDED. FOR THOSE PURPOSES AN ANSWER I PRAYED AND ASKED QUICKLY SO THE THE ONLY DIFFERENCE THEN IS JUST TIME LINE RIGHT SO LIKE BROOKE TRAILS IN WILLITS IS BEING EXPEDITED. UP IT'S ONE WAY AND ONE WAY OUT -- THE AND THAT'S BEEN ON THE LIST BUT IT WHAT IS HAPPENED PLEASE STOP ME IF I'M WRONG WITHIN THE TWENTY MILLION YOU'RE EXPEDITING THE PROJECTS -- THROUGH IN THEN YOU'RE ABLE TO SPEND ON THE THE TWENTY MILLION ON THOSE EXPEDITED PROJECTS I WANT TO BE SURE TO DEFER TO CAL FIRE IN TERMS OF THE METHODOLOGY FOR THE IDENTIFICATION OF THOSE PROJECTS -- AND AND SORT OF THE PLANT THERE. THIS IS OKAY AND THANK YOU AGAIN CENTER FOR THE QUESTION ON A RELATED TO THE THIRTY FIVE PROJECTS IN THE FORTY FIVE DAY REPORT -- WE HAVE IDENTIFIED THE FUNDS TO DO TO DO THAT OUT OF THIS YEAR'S -- GREENHOUSE GAS FIVE SO THE THOUGH THAT IS -- TAKING CARE OF RELATED TO HOW THOSE ARE PRIORITIZED AND AND THIS MAY OR MAY NOT GET TO THE MEAT OF YOUR QUESTION BUT THEY ARE PRIORITIZED TODAY THAT EACH ONE OF THOSE ON THE THIRTY FIVE IS EQUAL PRIORITY THEIR NUMBER ONE IN THE COMMUNITY. AND THEY WILL ALL BE -- TAKEN ON AT THE SAME TIME AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. I'M SORRY MR JUST BUT THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE IS YOU'RE ABLE TO MOVE QUICKER. ON THOSE THIRTY FIVE PROJECTS OTHERWISE YOU'D GET TORN. BUT THEY'RE GONNA GO TO THE TRADITIONAL PERMITTINGRIGHT AND SO DO YOU. THAT'S THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE THAT WERE SEEN WITH WHAT DOLLARS WOULD IT HOW DOLLARS WE SPEND THAT ARE IN THE BUDGET WE'RE CURRENTLY DISCUSSING WITH THAT IS ACCURATE. THAT IS ACCURATE THESE THIRTY FIVE PROJECTS WENT TO THE FRONT OF THE LINE OF ALL PROJECTS -- THAT ARE GOING TO BE FUN TO OTHERS AND THAT'S CHRISTMAS TO CHAIR DO YOU EXPECT TO SEE SOMETHING LIKE THIS AGAIN ON THE SECOND LAYER I JUST BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY PROJECTS ON THE LIST -- THAT HAVE PRIORITY IT AND THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION SO -- WHAT WE HAVE UNDER THIS IS A GENERAL -- SEQUEL -- EXEMPTION THAT WE THAT WE'RE WORKING THROUGH THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE AREN'T LOOKING AND LOOKING AT AND PROTECTING THE RESOURCES THAT ARE ON THOSE SITES. HOWEVER -- BEYOND THIS -- THIRTY FIVE IT'S OUR ANTICIPATION THAT. OBJECTS THAT ARE SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR GOING FORWARD -- WILL FOLLOW A SEQUEL PROCESS UNDER THE THE CAL VTP THIS WHICH IS THE CALIFORNIA VEGETATION TREATMENT PROGRAMMATIC DIR. THAT IS IN DEVELOPMENT. AND CERTAINLY WHEN THAT ITEM IS PRESENTED AND IT'S PROPERLY GET JAN DIES WE LOOK FORWARD TO A FULL DISCUSSION OF IT -- BUT WILL RETURN BACK TO THE ISSUE BEFORE US AND OPEN IT UP FOR A PUBLIC HEARING THIS IS IT THIS IS A TEN MILLION DOLLARS ON WILDFIRE PREVENTION RECOVERY LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE. THAT WILL GET A HOLD OPEN. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN MEMBERS PAUL MAY SO IT'S IN THE FOREST TRUST. AND OTHERS SAY OFF THE TOP I IN SUPPORT OF ALL OF THE PROVISIONS THAT ARE YOU'RE DEALING WITH HERE APART SEE IF YOUR AGENDA INCLUDING THE CONSERVATION CORPS IN A R. B. PIECES THAT I WON'T BE ABLE TO STAY -- FOR BY DOING A COUPLE OF OBSERVATIONS ON WHICH WERE DRIVEN BY THE ROBUST CONVERSATION WE JUST HAD -- ALL OF THE S. B. NINE A ONE IMPLEMENTATION AROUND THE FUELS REDUCTION AND IT'S BEEN SPREAD ACROSS ACROSS A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT HEARINGS AND SUB -- TO VERY SUPPORTIVE OF HAVING THE AGENCIES HAVE THE CAPACITY TO DO THE MONITORING LOOK AT THE IMPACTS TO THE PLANNING. ONE THING THAT I THINK YOU WANT -- TO JUST. BECAUSE IN ALL OF US TO MOVE FORWARD TO BE UNAVAILABLE LANGUAGE OR WHATEVER IS MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE REALLY GETTING THAT INTERAGENCY COORDINATION. SO THAT THIS. I MEAN COLLECTIVELY THIS IS AMONGST THE BIGGEST INVESTMENTS THE STATE HAS MADE AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE AND FOREST IN WATERSHEDS THAT WE HAVE SEEN I MEAN THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT. AMOUNT OF FUNDING OF STAFF LET'S MAKE SURE ALSO DOING SOME PLANNING SO AS WE'RE IMPLEMENTING FORCE CARBON PLAN GOALS OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF ACRES A YEAR OF YOU KNOW FUELS MANAGEMENT VEGETATION MANAGEMENT HABITAT MODIFICATION. THEY WERE ACTUALLY ACHIEVING IMPROVE WATERSHED RESILIENCE GOING FORWARD AND GETTING THAT -- INTERAGENCY COORDINATION LET'S MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE BEING PROACTIVE AND NOT JUST LOOKING AT THE IMPACTS OF PROJECTS THAT HAVE ALREADY HAPPENED. I THINK THAT THAT'S TO SOMETHING TO BE AWARE OF GOING BACK TO SOMETHING THIS ANGER STERN HAD RAISED IN TERMS OF THE PRIORITIZATION OF HOW TO UTILIZE THE FUNDING THAT CAL FIRE IS USING. YOU KNOW WE'RE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF LEAVING THAT TO THE DISCRETION OF THE DEPARTMENT TO SORT OF ADAPT TO THE SITUATION OF THE YEAR -- SOMETIMES THAT'S GOING TO BE WEIGHTED MORE HEAVILY TOWARDS SPECIFIC AROUND THE COMMUNITY. ACTIVITIES WE ALSO NEED TO BE MAKING INVESTMENTS AND WATERS AND RESILIENCE AND WE HAD A CONVERSATION IN THIS VERY ROOM TWO DAYS AGO ON A BOND TO GET THERE. THIS IS THE SINGLE LARGEST SOURCE OF FUNDING TO BE MOVING FORWARD ON SORT OF WATERSHED RESILIENCE IN KEY AREAS THAT WE HAVE SO I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO MAINTAIN THAT LATITUDE. IN TERMS OF SOME OF THE OTHER HOME INSPECTIONS IN THOSE THINGS. THERE'S ANY OTHER VEHICLES FOR THAT AND I'M LOOKING AT THE THE BILL THAT SOMEONE MEMBER ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD IS CARRYING A B. THIRTY EIGHT WHICH HAS BOTH -- MORE ROBUST INSPECTION PROCESS EASIER TRYING GET AFTER THAT LOW -- LOW INTEREST LOAN PROGRAM FOR RETROFIT SOME OF THOSE THINGS. I WOULD URGE US TO MAINTAIN STABILITY IN THESE PROGRAMS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE PARTICULARLY IN THE GRANT PROGRAM TO TALK A LITTLE BIT OF BUILDING WORK FORCE. HAVING THE STABILITY AND PREDICTABILITY YEAR OVER YEAR FOR THAT IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL IF WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE. TO YOU KNOW BUILD THE ARMY OF PEOPLE THEY WERE GOING TO NEED TO GET AFTER THESE ISSUES AT SCALE AND SO PIVOTING THESE PROGRAMS TO DIFFERENT -- FOCI YEAR OVER YEAR IS ACTUALLY KIND OF COUNTER PRODUCTIVE THAT WAY AND IT IS FREE TO WHICH WE CAN MAKE AN ONGOING COMMITMENT THAT YOU KNOW THERE'S GOING TO BE FUNDING HERE I THINK YOU SPOKE TO THIS EARLIER IN THE AGENDA. REALLY HELPS -- FOR PREDICTABILITY [inaudible] SO -- AND IT'S FINALLY ON THE ON THE AIR MONITORING -- DISCUSSION VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THAT ITEM THEY'LL COME UP HERE SHORTLY I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT THEIR RESOURCES BOARD HAS COME AN AWFUL LONG WAY OVER THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS. AND RECOGNIZING THAT THERE IS NO NO SMOKE OPTION JUST A MATTER OF HOW WE MANAGE THOSE HEALTH IMPACTS MOST EFFECTIVELY. AND HAVING BETTER MONITORING -- AND MODELING CAPABILITIES LETS US DO MORE WITH LESS IMPACT THANK YOU THANK YOU NECKS. MR KERRY MEMBERS HE'S AVAILABLE IN SILENCE I WOULD ALLY IN ALL OF OF MONTH PAUL'S COMMENTS WITH THE VIEW OF THE NATURE CONSERVANCY IN SUPPORT OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED FUNDING FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE WILDFIRE LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE. AND WE ALSO THINK SENATOR CERTAIN FOR HIS COMMENTS ON THE IMPORTANCE OF HOME HARDENING -- THAT BILL THAT PAUL REFERENCE WAS A B. THIRTY EIGHT AND WOULD CREATE THE FIRE HARDENED HOMES REVOLVING LOAN FUND AND WE THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE CONVERSATION THANK YOU. I WILL GO TO CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING WILL KEEP THIS MATTER -- OPEN AND THAT. THE FORCED AND FIRE PROTECTION -- CAL FIRE IS WE'RE DONE. I'M GOING TO TAKE SOME THINGS OUT OF ORDER BECAUSE I AM GOING TO BE LOSING MEMBERS SO I WOULD LIKE TO GO TO CALL UP THE AIR RESOURCE BOARD AND GO TO ISSUE NUMBER. FOUR WHICH IS THE CALIFORNIA CLEAN MILE STANDARD AN INCENTIVE PROGRAM THIS IS S. B.. TEN FOURTEEN THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION IS TO APPROVE AS BUDGET [inaudible] THIS IS. YOU CAN SAY. ALL RIGHT. GOOD AFTERNOON SENATOR WHITE HOUSE GANG MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS ET CHANG. I'M A DEPUTY EXECUTIVE OFFICER AT THEIR RESOURCES BOARD AND I'M WE'VE GOT FOUR PROPOSALS TODAY WERE HEARING ONE OF THEM TESE ARE ALL LET JUST THESE ARE ALL IN RESPONSE TO LEGISLATION. I'M SENATE BILL TEN FOURTEEN REQUIRES THERE BE TO ESTABLISH A GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS BASELINE FOR TRANSPORTATION NETWORK COMPANIES SO THIS IS LIKE UBER AND LEFT. THE LEGISLATION ALSO REQUIRES US TO SET ANNUAL TARGETS FOR REDUCTIONS IN GREENHOUSE GAS. EMISSIONS PER MILE DRIVEN ON BEHALF OF THE TEEN SEEDS WERE REQUESTING ONE P. Y. FOR TWO YEARS. TO DEVELOP AND BEGIN IMPLEMENTATION NOW RIDE SHARING IS CURRENTLY A VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THE MILES DRIVEN BUT IT IS GROWING RAPIDLY AND THIS IS A BIG DEAL FOR US AS THE SENATOR SAID. TRANSPORTATION EMISSIONS ARE GOING UP WHEN WE LOOK AT OUR GREENHOUSE GASES. FOR AN AVERAGE TEEN C. FOR EVERY THREE MILES THAT YOU ARE WRITING IN THAT LEFT THAT CARS DRIVEN TWO MILES. TO COME GET YOU ARE JUST DRIVING AROUND LOOKING FOR A RIDE SO THAT'S A LOT OF EXTRA MILES OUT THERE. AND THIS IS THE FIRST REGULATION OF ITS KIND IN THE WORLD SO WE HAVE NO EXACT BLUEPRINTS TO FOLLOW. AND WE'RE ALSO GOING TO HAVE TO BE LOOKING AT ASSESSING DRIVERLESS AUTOMATED VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY BECAUSE WE THINK THAT'S WHERE THE TEA AND SEES ARE GONNA BE GOING IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS -- WE ARE GOING TO LEVERAGE RELATED EXPERIENCES FROM OTHER TYPES OF VEHICLE PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE THE ADVANCE CLEAN CAR PROGRAM. BUT MUCH OF THE WORK THAT WE NEED TO DO HERE IS UNIQUE ANNA CAMP ABSORBED ELSEWHERE. SO WE APPRECIATE THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION -- TO APPROVE AND WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT HELLO. THE CONCERNED MEMBERS ANY QUESTIONS ON THIS ISSUE. IT'S OPEN UP A PUBLIC HEARING THIS IS. ISSUE NUMBER FOUR CLEAN. S. B. TEN FOURTEEN IMPLEMENTATION. CLOSE PUBLIC HEARING THERE'S A MOTION BY SINISTER PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. WE CASKEY HI. JONES REQUIRE. MORNING NIGHT STARING AT THAT MATTER PASSES FOR ZERO THE POLICE BECAUSE OF THE ISSUE NUMBER FIVE WHICH IS YOUR INCREASING YOUR TRUCK LOAN PROGRAM GRANTS. THIS IS A STAFF APPROVAL -- HAS BUDGETED. SO THE TRUCK ONE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO HELP SMALL FLEETS COMPLY WITH THE AIR BASE IN USE TRUCK AND BUS ROLE. CITY IN USE TRUCK AND BUS REAL BASICALLY REQUIRES AN ON ROAD VEHICLES BECOME CLEAN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT COMPONENT. OF OUR MOVE TO CLEAN UP -- TO REDUCE EMISSIONS THAT AFFECT COMMUNITIES ESPECIALLY COMMUNITIES AT OR NEAR BUT HE'S BUSY ROADWAYS AND FREIGHT HUBS. THIS PROGRAM USES AIR QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM FUNDS TO HELP SMALL BUSINESS FLEET OWNERS AFFECTED BY THIS RULE GET FINANCING FOR UPGRADING THEIR FLEETS WITH NEWER TRACKS. WE IMPLEMENT IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CALIFORNIA POLLUTION CONTROL FINANCING AUTHORITY THROUGH THEIR CAL CAP PROGRAM. WE'RE BASICALLY LEVERAGING PUBLIC FUNDING WITH PRIVATE FUNDING FOR PARTICIPATING LENDING INSTITUTIONS SO WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT FLEET OWNERS THAT CAN'T MEET CONVENTIONAL LENDING CRITERIA CAN QUALIFY FOR TRADITIONAL FINANCING. GETTING WITH LOANS THAT ARE BACKED BY THE STATE. THE LENDERS USER TRADITIONAL UNDERWRITING STANDARDS TO ESTABLISH LOAN TERMS WITHIN THE PROGRAM GUIDELINES. NOW THE CONNECTION HERE IS THAT -- SP ONE HAS REQUIREMENT THAT STARTING IN TWENTY TWENTY DMV HAS TO VERIFY COMPLIANCE WITH THE TRUCK AND BUS RULE BEFORE THE ISSUE REGISTRATION FOR TRUCKS. SO WHAT THIS MEANS IS WE KNOW THAT THIS PROGRAM AS WE LEAD UP TO TWENTY TWENTY IS GOING TO BECOME EVEN MORE POPULAR -- IT WITH THE FORECAST THE DEMAND IS EXPECTED TO EVEN EXCEED AVAILABLE FUNDS. THERE'S CURRENTLY A BALANCE IN THIS FUND AND WHAT THIS BCP REQUEST IS AN INCREASE OF NINETEEN POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN FISCAL YEAR. NINETEEN TWENTY THAT WOULD BRING THE TOTAL LOCAL ASSISTANCE FOR THIS PROGRAM TO FORTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN THIS FISCAL YEAR AND THAT COVERS LOANS FOR ABOUT SIXTEEN THOUSAND TRUCKS. ON THIS PROGRAM IS A KEY COMPONENT OF HOW HELPING SMALL BUSINESSES COMPLY WITH THE TRUCK AND BUS RULE AND HAVING A SMOOTH IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS SP ONE REQUIREMENT. SO I HAVE MY TWENTY ONE YEAR OLD TRUCK. TRUCK. JUDGMENT DAY IS COMING NEXT JANUARY YES THERE'S FORTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS HERE IS THE CALCULATION THAT. THE PEOPLE THAT WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS. FINANCING. YOU ARE GOING TO BE HAPPY WITH THEIR NEW FOR TRUCK THAT THEY GET FINANCE AND NOT POLLUTING OR THERE COULD BE SOME UNHAPPY PEOPLE HERE. ON JANUARY SECOND THAT DIDN'T GET THE PROGRAM AND THEY'RE OUT OF COMPLIANCE WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN TO AND TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE KNOW WHAT THEY'RE OFF FIRST OF ALL THAT THIS REQUIREMENT IS COMING. AND THAT ALSO THAT THE FOR THE OPTIONS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO THEM INCLUDING THIS FINANCING PROGRAM. SO THIS FINANCING PROGRAM HAS BEEN OVERSUBSCRIBED AND SO WE'RE LOOKING AT PROVIDING MORE FUNDING INTO IT AS MUCH FUNDING AS WE CAN. ELIA. MEMBERS QUESTIONS ON THIS ISSUE STAFF RECOMMENDATIONS PROVE HIS BUDGET TO OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING. THIS IS THE ENGINE TRUCK ONE PROGRAM NOW JUST. THE CITRIC ONE PROGRAM CLOSE PUBLIC HEARING THERE'S A MOTION BY SENATE STERN PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. CASKEY HI JONES THE CHOIR. MORNING. STERN. THE CLOSER ROLE THE BUDGET REQUEST IS APPROVED [inaudible] FOR ZERO HI -- LET'S DISCUSS THIS ISSUE NUMBER SIX AND WE'LL GO BACK UP TO ONE ANOTHER. ONE OF THIS IS THE TRUCK IN. THE OLD. BEFORE I GET TO THIS I WAS AN AUTHOR OF A LETTER WHICH SOME OTHER MEMBERS THAT WE SENT A MARCH FIRST REGARDING -- CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM ACHIEVING THE S. B.. THIRTY TWO HAVE ANY IDEA WHEN WE MAKE AN ANSWER ON THAT WE THOUGHT YOU MIGHT ASK ABOUT THIS ON HER -- WE ARE WORKING ON THAT RESPONSE AND I THINK WE'RE PRETTY CLOSE ARE HOPING TO GET YOU GET YOU A RESPONSE VERY VERY SOON THANK YOU FOR ATTENTION LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER SIX YOUR TRUCK AND BUS REGULATION COMPLIANCE OKAY SO AS I MENTIONED -- SP ONE HAS A PROVISION THAT -- REQUIRES A DMV VERIFY TRACKS I HAVE MET THE REQUIREMENTS OF OUR REGULATION BEFORE THEY ISSUE REGISTRATION THERE'S ALSO TWO OTHER -- ELEMENTS OF SB ONE THAT AFFECT YOUR RESOURCES BOARD WINE IS WERE REQUIRED TO DO IN A MISSION ANALYSIS OF THE IMPACT OF THE TRUCK AND BUS PROVISIONS OF SB. ONE AND THEN WE'RE ALSO REQUIRED TO CONSULT WITH CAL TRANS AND THE CALIFORNIA TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION ON PLANNING GUIDELINES. SAID THIS BCP REQUESTS FIFTEEN POSITIONS ON TO IMPLEMENT THESE PROVISIONS FOURTEEN OF THESE POSITIONS ARE THREE YEAR LIMITED TERM AND ONE WOULD BE PERMANENT. SO I'M JUST KIND OF TALK THROUGH REAL QUICKLY WHAT THESE THREE PIECES ARE THE LARGEST REQUEST IS FOR THIRTEEN THREE YEAR LIMITED TERM POSITIONS TO HELP US MOVE BILLY INFANT IMPLEMENT THIS DMV VERIFICATION PORTION -- FORMAL CURRENTLY WORKING CLOSELY WITH DMV TO ENSURE THAT OUR COMPUTER SYSTEM WORKS WELL WITH THEIR COMPUTER SYSTEM. AND WE'RE ALSO MAKING PROACTIVE EFFORTS TO ENSURE THAT TRUCKING COMPANIES KNOW ABOUT THESE UPCOMING REQUIREMENTS AND THEY KNOW ABOUT THE COMPLAINTS ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS LIKE THE TRUCK LINE -- AS THIS DATE AS JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY APPROACHES WE ANTICIPATE A LARGE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF FLEETS ARE GONNA BE HAUNTING CONTACTING US TO SEEK GUIDANCE ON WHAT ARE THESE REQUIREMENTS. I'M SUBMITTING INFORMATION TO SEE WHETHER THEIR FLEETS ARE IN COMPLIANCE TO LEARN ABOUT FUNDING ASSISTANCE AND SO WE WANT TO RAMP UP OUR STAFF SO THAT WE CAN -- MEET THAT NEED. AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE ALSO MAKING CONCERTED EFFORT TO CONTACT TRUCK AND BUS OWNERS WHO ARE CURRENTLY NON COMPLIANT SO THAT THEY'RE NOT SURPRISED WHEN JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY COME AROUND. ENFORCEMENT IS ALSO REALLY CRITICAL BECAUSE WE WANT TO ENSURE EQUITY FOR THE TRUCK OWNERS WHO HAVE INVESTED AND COMPLY WITH THE REGULATION WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE NOT DISADVANTAGED. SO -- WE'RE CURRENTLY ANALYZING -- OWNERS FLEETS ADDRESSING PENALTIES DEVELOPING SETTLEMENT OPTIONS AT THESE COMPLAINTS DEADLINES ARE COMING UP AND THESE ARE THIS WORKLOAD IS GOING TO CONTINUE THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY THREE AS A COMPLIANCE -- PHASES AND THE SECOND PART OF SP ONE THAT AFFECTS US AS I MENTIONED AS WERE SUPPOSED TO EVALUATE. THE EMISSIONS OF THIS AUTOMATIC ENFORCEMENT PROVISION AS WELL AS ANOTHER PROVISION THAT RELATES TO THE USEFUL LIFE OF TRUCKS. SO THE ARM OUR REPORT TO REPORT BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE IN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE ON THE IMPACT AND WE'RE ASKING FOR ONE LIMITED TERM POSITION TO BEGIN THAT ANALYSIS NOW. AND THEN LASTLY WERE REQUESTING ONE PERMANENT POSITION TO PROVIDE CONSULTATION TO CAL TRANS NCTC ON DEVELOPING GRANT GUIDELINES -- S. UNDER SP ONE CALTRANS RECEIVED FUNDS FOR LOCAL PLANNING GRANTS AND THE LEGISLATION ALSO DIRECTS CARB TO PROVIDE THE LINKAGES BETWEEN THESE GRANTS AND SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATION PLANNING. YOU'RE NOT ASKING FOR ANYBODY TO HELP ESTABLISH THIS DATABASE WITH DMV. SO THERE ARE WE HAVE RECEIVED FUNDING IN LAST YEAR'S BDGET ON TO DO A PORTION OF THAT WORK AND THEN THERE WAS A TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENT UNDER -- A IT WAS A SORT OF A OMNIBUS CALLIE PA TECHNICAL PIECE THAT WAIVERS ANOTHER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS THIS YEAR. WE DON'T HAVE THOSE PEOPLE TOLD. APRIL ELEVENTH SO [inaudible] HELLO [inaudible] NO COMMENT. THIS IS THE HOLD OPEN MATTER SO I'LL. HAVE THE PUBLIC HEARING WHEN I HAVE ALL THE OTHER HOLD OF MANNERS. WITH THAT NO QUESTION SCOTT ISSUE NUMBER. ONE THIS IS THE SO THIS IS -- SP TWELVE SIXTY WHICH SENATOR REQUIRE HAD A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS FOR CAL FIRE AND SO I CAN HOPE I HOPE THAT I CAN ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE HERE. I'M WHAT THIS BCP IS INTENDED TO DO IS TO HELP US IMPLEMENT A BETTER SMOKE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM I'M SO THAT INCLUDES AIR MONITORING SMOKE MODELING AND INCREASE PUBLIC OUTREACH WE'RE REQESTING THREE AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS IN THE FIRST YEAR AND THEN ONGOING FUNDING I'VE TWO POINT NINE MILLION. DOLLARS A WE'VE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT THEIR DISTRICTS ARE THE ONES WHO ACTUALLY MAKE THE ON THE GROUND DECISIONS ABOUT WHICH BURNS ARE AUTHORIZED. AND SO THIS FUNDING REQUESTS INCLUDES TWO MILLION DOLLARS TO HELP BUILD THE CAPACITY OF LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS SO THAT WE CAN BE MORE EXPEDITIOUS AND MORE COMPLETE AS WE MAKE THESE. DECISIONS. THIS REQUEST IS BUILT ON A PILOT PROGRAM THAT WE DID WITH CAL FIRE AND DISTRICTS LAST YEAR AND WHAT WE DID IN THIS PILOT PROGRAM IS WE PUT MONITORS OUT AND SO WE COULD MONITOR AIR QUALITY AND METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS. OUT AROUND PRESCRIBED FIRES AND OUR GOAL WAS TO SEE COULD WE ACTUALLY INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF ACREAGE AND THE NUMBER OF DAYS THAT PEOPLE COULD BURN SO WE'RE TRYING TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION HERE AND LOOK AT HOW CAN WE DO BETTER TO THE TEAM. PART OF THE TEAM RIGHT WE WANT TO PROTECT THEIR QUALITY PROTECT THE PUBLIC HEALTH IN THESE AREAS BUT ALSO RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING MORE PRESCRIBED FIRE. THIS PILOT WAS SUCCESSFUL THEY'RE ACTUALLY CASES WHERE YOU KNOW WE COULD CALL UP CAL FIRE AND SAY HEY BEER QUALITY LOOKS GOOD OUT THERE YOU CAN CONTINUE TO BURN. AND SO THESE REQUESTED RESOURCES ARE GOING TO SUPPORT ADDITIONAL AIR MONITORING FOR AN INCREASED NUMBER PRESCRIBED FIRES. ON IT ALSO HAS A COMPONENT OF IMPROVE SMOKE MODELING THAT'S GONNA HELP US REFINE. AND SORT OF THE IMPACTS OF FIRE THAT INFORMATION IS GOING TO BE USE AN ONLINE TOOL THAT WE CALLED P. FURS. AND THAT BASICALLY IS THE PRESCRIBED FIRE APPROVAL IT'S LIKE AN ELECTRONIC SYSTEM US FOREST SERVICE CAL FIRE AND OTHER FOLKS USE IT. AND IT'S THE ELECTRONIC SYSTEM WE USE THAT FOR PRESCRIBED FIRE APPROVAL AND REPORTING. THAT SYSTEM WILL ALSO ALLOW US TO TRACK WHETHER WE'RE ACTUALLY SEEING INCREASES AND PRESCRIBED FIRE SO THAT'S KIND OF A IT'S A WAY THAT WE CAN LOOK AT THOSE METRICS. ON FINALLY THESE REQUESTED RESOURCES ARE ALSO GOING TO ENABLE US TO EXPAND OUR PUBLIC OUTREACH EFFORTS AND TO COORDINATE MORE COMMON MESSAGING WITH OTHER AGENCIES THAT ARE WORKING ON OUTREACH. WHEN YOU'RE DOING THIS MODELING THAT AGAIN THIS IS? MAYBE I'M SHOWING MY AGE IVETE WE'RE IN A WE'RE IN MARCH IT RAINS. IT STRUCK IT'S CLEAR IT RAINS IT'S CLEAR IT RAIN SIX CLEVER SORT OF GO THROUGH THIS THIS. GOOD AIR QUALITY TIME IS IT IS IT IS THE MODELING WHEN WE HAVE SPRING WE HAVE THIS OFF AND ON RAIN THAT YOU WOULD BE DOING THOSE BURNS. AFTER THE RAINS YOU KNOW BEFORE WE KNOW ANOTHER STORM SYSTEMS COMING IN YOU SAY OKAY. DO YOUR BURNED AND THEN. IS THAT ONE OF THESE MODELS I GUESS IS MY QUESTION SO WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS BOLD WEATHER. AND SMOKE SO WHAT WE WANT TO KNOW IS IS THE SMOKE GOING TO BE STUCK CLOSE TO THE GROUND AND THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE NEAR WHERE THIS PRESCRIBED FIRES COMING ARE THEY GOING TO BE. INUNDATED WITH THE SMOKE OR IS IT A SITUATION WHERE YOUR INVERSION LAYERS HIRED YOUR SMOKE IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO SORT OF DISSIPATE AND MOVE AROUND -- SO WHAT WORDS SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET IMPROVED INFORMATION TO LOOK AT IN MY UNDERSTANDING AND I DON'T KNOW IF THE CHIEF IS STILL HERE. NO PRESCRIBED FIRE SEASON IS STARTING TO COME UP WE'RE LOOKING AT SORT OF LATE SPRING. AND SO YOU KNOW WE HAVE A QUICK MEANT THAT WE HAVE PURCHASED USING LAST YEAR'S MONEY LAST FISCAL YEARS FINDING. THAT WE ARE AND PLANNING TO HAVE READY FOR THIS PRESCRIBED FIRE SEASON SO THAT WE CAN START MAKING THESE IMPROVEMENTS AND START BEING A LITTLE BIT MORE -- PRECISE I GUESS THE YOU KNOW I AGAIN I'M GONNA BE. INELEGANT HERE IS THAT IS THAT WE KNOW THAT IF THERE'S BURNS IT THE IT MAY BE A NUISANCE FOR FOR THAT THAT THE PEOPLE THERE IT MAY BE. IT MAY GO IF WE'RE FOR SAYING THE TOLERANCE LEVEL IS ONE HUNDRED MAKE A 1-001-100-2100 FOUR ONE HUNDRED FIVE BUT BUT THE DEATH ZONE IS SO INUNDATED WITH. TIMBER AND WITH WITH -- FUEL THAT AND IT'S ONE OF THE IDENTIFIED HOT SPOTS THAT WE THINK THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE A THIS COULD BE A FIRE SO EVEN IF IT. EVEN IF IT DOESN'T MEET. THE GUIDELINES THAT WE HAVE FOR THE ERROR -- CALL AIR QUALITY. WHO MAKES THAT DECISION TO SAY? HEY BEEN ESPECIALLY AS WE GET CLOSE TO THE FIRE SEASON YOU KNOW THERE'S A THERE'S A IT'S A JUDGMENT CALL ON THESE THINGS WERE. BLOCKED OFF STIPULATED IT'S A NEW SENSE AT ALL STIPULATED THAT IT EXCEEDS THE TECHNICAL LIMITS THAT YOU HAVE I THINK THAT THE END OF THE THE PUBLIC ONCE SAID INSURANCE. THAT WERE PART OF THE TEAM AND THOUGH A BIT AND IN THE IT MAY EXCEED THE AIR QUALITY NUMBER FOR THIS DAY AT THIS HOUR. THE BIG PICTURE WITH THE FIRE OR THE POTENTIAL FIRES IS GONNA BE CATASTROPHIC A GUIDE YES IT IS -- I I KNOW I THINK THAT THIS IS IT'S A IT'S A REALLY CHALLENGING AREA AND YOU KNOW I I WAS ON A PANEL A COUPLE MONTHS AGO NOW WITH THE GENTLEMAN WHO'S. KIND OF A HE'S A FIRE EXPERT AND HE LIVES OUTSIDE SEQUOIA NATIONAL PARK AND HE TOLD THE ANECDOTE WHEN HE WAS ON THE PANEL HE SAYS YOU KNOW HE'S A FIRE EXPERT HE UNDERSTANDS THE ROLE OF FIRE THE NEED FOR PRESCRIBED FIRE THE ACCESS LOADING THAT WE HAVE IN. OUR FORESTS HIS TOWN IS ONE OF THE TOWNS THAT IS IMPACTED WHEN THERE IS PRESCRIBED FIRE BECAUSE THEY GET SMOKE WHEN THERE'S PRESCRIBED FIRE EVEN WHEN WE MAKE A GOOD BURN CALL THEY GET SMOKE. AND HE SAID HE SAYS YOU KNOW. IT IRRITATES ME I DON'T LIKE IT WHEN THERE'S FIRE THEIR INTELLECTUALLY I KNOW. THAT THIS IS THIS IS WHAT WE NEED TO DO AND HE'S SORT OF AN EXPERT IN THIS AREA. SO I THINK YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE IS THAT WE CAN PROVIDE AND YET THAT'S SORT OF AN IRRITATION FACTOR BUT I THINK THE OTHER THING THAT WE HAVE TO CONSIDER IS THAT SMOKE REALLY IS A HEALTH RISK. FOR SOME PEOPLE YOU KNOW FOR THE YOUNG FOR THE AGE FOR THE FOR THE ILL. AND SO -- STATE LAW SAYS THAT THE WAY THAT WE MAKE THESE BIRD CALLS HIS DISTRICTS HAVE THE ULTIMATE -- SAY ON WHO'S GONNA BURN HOW MANY ACRES THEY'RE GONNA BURN AND WHERE THEY CAN BURN IN THESE AREAS. SYSTEM AS PROVIDE THEM WITH AS MUCH INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE SO THAT WE CAN MAKE GOOD DECISIONS AND WE CAN BE AS EXPANSIVE AS POSSIBLE WHEN WE MAKE THESE DECISIONS? I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING AND I THINK IT IS IT'S IS REALLY TOUGH BALANCE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE BETWEEN PROTECTING THE PUBLIC HEALTH WHEN WE ARE IN NO THAT WE'RE SETTING A FIRE. VERSES THE HUGE VOLUME OF WORK THAT WE NEED TO DO TO MANAGE OUR FORCING AND RESTORE FIRE INTO THE INTO THE MAR OUR WILD LANDS. DOWN MATES. LIKE TO ADD SOMETHING BRIEFLY IF I MAY LIVE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THAT'S WHAT WE ARE INCLUDING IN THIS PROPOSAL THE LOCAL ASSISTANCE FUNDING WE THINK IT'S VERY KEY TO HELP BUILD CAPACITY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. SO THAT WE CAN ADDRESS AND START TO WORK THROUGH THESE VERY ISSUES OF HOW DO WE BETTER COORDINATE THIS TO MEET OUR GOALS AND ALSO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH [inaudible] YEAH YOU. I MEAN I'M IN THE PUBLIC I'M CHAIRING THIS HEARING ANYONE TO GET PEOPLE THAT ARE UPSET ABOUT SOMETHING THEY ALWAYS SHOW UP AT THE MEETINGS AND GO TO YOUR LOCAL CITY COUNCIL BUT IT'S IT'S THE THE PEOPLE THAT WILL SAY. BACK. AGAIN AND THIS IS THE THIS IS TRICKY. THAT PRESCRIBED BURN WHEN THE BIG FIRE CAME. REALLY. CREATE A TOLERABLE -- CONDITIONS EVEN THOUGH IT EXCEEDED THE AIR QUALITY NUMBER FOR THAT TIME AND WE'RE IT'S OUR CHARGE I JUST I'M CONCERNED THAT. THAT WE HAVE ANOTHER TEN DAYS OR TWELVE DAYS LIKE WE HAD LAST YEAR IN THE THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE QUEUING UP TO SPEAK TO THIS COMMITTEE ABOUT THE HOW -- TO STREAMLINE. THE PROCESS SO THAT THIS WORK TO GET DONE IS JUST IS JUST. THE THING YOU HAVE SOMETHING THAT REQUIRES YOU REALLY QUICK. I APPRECIATE THE FEEDBACK ON THAT. I THINK THE PERFECT GET IN THE WAY THE GOOD -- IS CRITICAL FOR THIS CONVERSATION -- AND PLEASE WHERE I LIVE WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT PRESCRIBED FIRES DONE FIRE BREAKS. IN THESE MASSIVE WILDFIRES HAVE HOT HOW FAST. THEY BEEN BURNING. IT STOPS THEM IN THEIR TRACKS AS FAR AS SLOAN IT DOWN. AND CAN'T LET THE PERFECT IN THE WAY THE GOOD IN WELL JUST SAY IS ONE CHALLENGE AND NOT AT ALL TRYING TO THROW STONES. WE HAVE INDIVIDUALS WILL BE DOING THE SAME JOB. AND CANDIDLY STOPPING. THE PRACTICE THAT WERE SAYING WE NEED TO KNOW SPEED UP. FOR THEIR ENTIRE CAREER. IN IT'S THEIR JOB RIGHT. THAT COULD BE ON THE ISSUES OF AGRICULTURAL BURNING OR THE ISSUES A PRESCRIBED BURNING -- SO. I JUST I'M CONCERNED. THAT IT IS GOING TO TAKE LONGER TO MAKE THE CONTROL SHIFT THEN WHAT WE MAY ANTICIPATE. I'M AND COMPLETELY WHERE A LOT OF IT IS ULTIMATELY UP TO THE AIR DISTRICT AND I'LL SHARE WITH YOU. THERE ARE SOME CHALLENGES LOCALLY AND I GET IT BECAUSE THAT'S THEIR JOB -- IN WE CAN THROW AS MUCH MONEY AS WE WANT ADD IT. BUT IT'S THE CULTURE IT'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE ABLE TO CHANGE. THAT IS WHY ONE OF THE POSITIONS WERE INCLUDING IN THIS PROPOSAL IS A PUBLIC INFORMATION OFFICER TO START HELPING TO ADDRESS THAT CULTURAL CHANGE. IS THAT WHAT THIS IS IT IS SEVEN THE AIRPORT STAFF FOR THE PUBLIC YEAH I THINK HE'S TALKING ABOUT THE BOARD. STAFF I MEAN IT'S SO IT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE PUBLIC I THINK THE PUBLIC IS ON OUR SIDE -- ON THIS ISSUE BUT WHAT I'LL SAY WITH YOU IT'S IN MORE IN. AGAIN. ELEVEN THEY DO A GREAT JOB AND ON THIS ISSUE -- WE ARE ASKING THE CHANGE THEY'VE ALWAYS STOPPED. SO -- OR HAD SERIOUS CONCERNS OVER. LEGITIMATE BY THE WAY RIGHT SO I I I'M MORE CONCERNED ABOUT THE INTERNAL -- BECAUSE I THINK THAT THE PUBLIC. CAN SEE THE BIG PICTURE MOST CASES NOT ALWAYS BUT SEE THE BIG PICTURE OF THE GREATER GOOD. NO I I APPRECIATE THAT AND YOU KNOW WE DO WANT TO USE THE RESOURCES THAT WE WOULD GET IN THIS BCP TO LOOK AT THOSE FRICTION POINTS AND SOME OF THOSE FRICTION POINTS MAY BE -- SORT OF I'M GONNA SAY SORT OF BEING IN A RIGHT FROM THE WAY THAT YOU'VE DONE THINGS BEFORE AND SO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE DISTRICTS IN CALIFORNIA THEIR LAND MANAGERS ON TO TRY TO SOLVE THOSE ISSUES. IN THROUGH THE CHAIR IN ONE OF THE ITEMS THAT WOULD LOVE TO BE A C. AS WE MOVE FORWARD IS HOW DO WE EVALUATE. THE INTERNAL BECAUSE I I I HEAR YOU IN REGARDS TO EXTERNAL BUT WHAT DOES SUCCESS LOOK LIKE I COULD SET. MY BIGGEST CONCERN IN THE END AGAIN NOT AT ALL TRYING TO BE CRITICAL BECAUSE THEY'RE DOING THEIR JOBS MY BIGGEST CONCERN IS HOW DO WE MOVE THE SHIP. HI TO BE ABLE TO ALLOW ADDITIONAL ACRES NO IT'S A BALANCE IT. THANK YOU THANK YOU.
