WENT ON STRIKE SPECIFICALLY

01:55:29.222 --> 01:55:31.891
BECAUSE THIS IS AS COLD IT WAS

01:55:31.958 --> 01:55:34.427
REALLY HITTING US HARD AND THE

01:55:34.494 --> 01:55:35.762
PARTICULAR RESTAURANT DIDN'T

01:55:35.828 --> 01:55:38.498

THEY RETURNED ON THAT FRIDAY AT

FIVE AM. AND TO THEIR DELIGHT

01:55:52.111 --> 01:55:54.013
THE MANAGEMENT ACTUALLY DID PUT

01:55:54.080 --> 01:55:57.083
HIM MEASURES FOR THEIR SAFETY

01:55:57.150 --> 01:56:00.186
NOW THAT WAS A GOOD CASE

01:56:00.253 --> 01:56:02.422
SCENARIO GOOD OUTCOME THE MAD

01:56:02.488 --> 01:56:04.290
THE THAT RUSSIA COULD EASILY

01:56:04.357 --> 01:56:05.925
JUST INSPIRED THEM. ABOUT A

01:56:05.992 --> 01:56:08.361
BEEN THE END OF THE STORY. AND

01:56:08.428 --> 01:56:10.963
THE REALITY IS THAT FOR SO MANY

01:56:11.030 --> 01:56:13.199
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS. OF OUR

01:56:13.266 --> 01:56:15.401
WORKERS THAT IS HOW THEY LIVE

01:56:15.468 --> 01:56:17.503
THEY LIVE AT THE WHIM. OF WHAT

01:56:17.570 --> 01:56:18.971
THEIR EMPLOYER CHOOSES TO DO OR

01:56:19.038 --> 01:56:22.542
NOT. AND YOU KNOW WE CAN HAVE

01:56:22.608 --> 01:56:24.510
THIS TALK ABOUT- FOR FORTY

01:56:24.577 --> 01:56:25.912
YEARS THIS OUT OF THE OTHER.

01:56:25.978 --> 01:56:27.447
BLESSED RECORD HOP WHAT'S

01:56:27.513 --> 01:56:28.014
HAPPENED OVER THE LAST FORTY

01:56:28.081 --> 01:56:30.149
YEARS FOR WORKERS TO OUR FAST

01:56:30.216 --> 01:56:32.251
FOOD WORKERS TWELVE. WE'LL GO

01:56:32.318 --> 01:56:34.554
WAGE WORKERS OVER THE LAST

01:56:34.620 --> 01:56:36.222
FORTY YEARS. THEY HAD BECOME

01:56:36.289 --> 01:56:38.458
LESS SOME POWER. THEY HAVE

01:56:38.524 --> 01:56:40.259
THEIR WAGES HAVE REMAINED

01:56:40.326 --> 01:56:41.994
STAGNANT EVEN WITH US

01:56:42.061 --> 01:56:42.829
INCREASING MINIMUM WAGES STILL

01:56:42.895 --> 01:56:44.797
HASN'T KEPT UP. WITH THE COST

01:56:44.864 --> 01:56:47.967
OF LIVING INCREASES. AND THIS

01:56:48.034 --> 01:56:51.270
PROPOSAL IS ACTUALLY. A VERY

01:56:51.337 --> 01:56:52.972
THOUGHTFUL WAY FOR US TO CREATE

01:56:53.039 --> 01:56:55.141
INDUSTRY WIDE STANDARDS WHERE

01:56:55.208 --> 01:56:55.775
THEY DID WHERE IT DOESN'T EXIST

01:56:55.842 --> 01:56:58.311
RIGHT NOW. AND SO IT'S NOT SOME

01:56:58.378 --> 01:56:59.912
FAR FETCHED IDEA OF QUITE THE

01:56:59.979 --> 01:57:01.481
OPPOSITE IT'S ACTUALLY A VERY

01:57:01.547 --> 01:57:03.516
THOUGHTFUL WAY. OF HELPING TO

01:57:03.583 --> 01:57:06.018
GUIDE OUR STATE HOPING TO GUIDE

01:57:06.085 --> 01:57:09.522
OSHA- BUT WHICH WE ALWAYS GOT I

01:57:09.589 --> 01:57:11.591
JUST OF THE BILL LAST YEAR THAT

01:57:11.657 --> 01:57:13.159
WAS SIGNED THAT DIRECTED

01:57:13.226 --> 01:57:14.827
ACTIONS THAT OSHA NEEDS TO TAKE

01:57:14.894 --> 01:57:16.262
IN TERMS OF PROTECTING WORKERS.

01:57:16.329 --> 01:57:18.364
SO THIS IS NOT UNCOMMON AND I

01:57:18.431 --> 01:57:19.766
THINK IT'S ACTUALLY MUCH MORE

01:57:19.832 --> 01:57:20.733
THOUGHTFUL THAN US HAVING TO

01:57:20.800 --> 01:57:21.968
COME BACK EVERY YEAR AND DO ONE

01:57:22.034 --> 01:57:23.703
OFF BILLS HERE ONE OF BILLS

01:57:23.770 --> 01:57:25.605
THERE INSTEAD WE WILL ACTUALLY

01:57:25.671 --> 01:57:30.143
HAVE. A COUNCIL. THAT WE HAVE.

01:57:30.209 --> 01:57:32.412
THROUGH OUR SPEAKER. THE

01:57:32.478 --> 01:57:34.781
ABILITY TO APPOINT. FOLKS WITH

01:57:34.847 --> 01:57:36.416
EXPERTISE IN THESE AREAS OF

01:57:36.482 --> 01:57:39.218
PUBLIC HEALTH. TO ADVISE AS TO

01:57:39.285 --> 01:57:40.486
WHAT INDUSTRY WIDE STANDARDS

01:57:40.553 --> 01:57:41.988
MAKE THE MOST SENSE AND I

01:57:42.054 --> 01:57:43.890
ABSOLUTELY AGREE I WOULD LIKE

01:57:43.956 --> 01:57:45.124
WITH OUR COLLEAGUES AS WE NEED

01:57:45.191 --> 01:57:46.426
MORE MORE OSHA INSPECTORS

01:57:46.492 --> 01:57:48.428
ABSOLUTELY SIGN ME UP. WE NEED

01:57:48.494 --> 01:57:50.062
TO PUT MUCH MORE IN TWO

01:57:50.129 --> 01:57:51.964
INSPECTORS OSHA INSPECTORS WE

01:57:52.031 --> 01:57:53.733
NEED MULTI LINGUAL OSHA

01:57:53.800 --> 01:57:55.535
INSPECTORS FAR MORE THAN WE

01:57:55.601 --> 01:57:58.337
HAVE NOW SO I ABSOLUTELY WILL

01:57:58.404 --> 01:58:01.174
COSIGN THAT AND IF THIS BILL-

01:58:01.240 --> 01:58:02.975
IS SUCCESSFUL AND IS SIGNED BY

01:58:03.042 --> 01:58:04.310
THE GOVERNOR OUR NEXT STEP

01:58:04.377 --> 01:58:05.912
SHOULD BE ABSOLUTELY TO

01:58:05.978 --> 01:58:07.280
INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF

01:58:07.346 --> 01:58:09.315
RESOURCES WE GIVE TO OSHA AS WE

01:58:09.382 --> 01:58:11.083
SEE IN THIS PANDEMIC. IS THAT

01:58:11.150 --> 01:58:14.821
LACK OF ABILITY FOR OSHA TO DO

01:58:14.887 --> 01:58:17.990
INSPECTIONS THAT HAS LED. TO

01:58:18.057 --> 01:58:19.492
NOT BE ABLE TO KEEP UP WITH SO

01:58:19.559 --> 01:58:20.560
MANY OF THE SAFETY STANDARDS

01:58:20.626 --> 01:58:22.895
FALLING BELOW BUT WE SHOULD ALL

01:58:22.962 --> 01:58:24.797
BE CONSUMED WILL BE SHUT OFF

01:58:24.864 --> 01:58:27.166
CONSIDERED THE STATUS QUO AND

01:58:27.233 --> 01:58:29.502
SO. THERE'S A REASON WHY THE

01:58:29.569 --> 01:58:30.670
NUMBER ONE PROFESSION THAT'S

01:58:30.736 --> 01:58:33.406
DIED DURING TWELVE IT OR COOKS

01:58:33.473 --> 01:58:34.140
THESE ARE COOKS A FANCY

01:58:34.207 --> 01:58:38.110
RESTAURANTS. YOU KNOW OF YOUR

01:58:38.177 --> 01:58:38.744
FOUR STAR RESTAURANTS. THE ARE

01:58:38.811 --> 01:58:39.612
CLOSE ABOUT WOULD REST THAT

01:58:39.679 --> 01:58:41.113
HAVE BEEN. THE NUMBER ONE

01:58:41.180 --> 01:58:43.616
PROFESSIONALS DIED FROM COLD.

01:58:43.683 --> 01:58:45.084
AND SO IT'S ABOUT TIME THAT WE

01:58:45.151 --> 01:58:46.953
HAVE WILL BE PUT IN PLACE. AND

01:58:47.019 --> 01:58:49.589
ACTUALLY ORGANIZED A MECHANISM

01:58:49.655 --> 01:58:51.557
TO PUT FORTH HEALTH AND SAFETY

01:58:51.624 --> 01:58:54.093
STANDARDS FOR THE FAST FOOD

01:58:54.160 --> 01:58:56.662
SECTOR. AND SO YOU KNOW. I GET

01:58:56.729 --> 01:58:58.431
I GET AGAIN LET'S NOT FALL INTO

01:58:58.498 --> 01:59:00.766
THIS. FEAR MONGERING TRAP THAT

01:59:00.833 --> 01:59:02.835
SOMEHOW THIS IS SOME. YOU KNOW

01:59:02.902 --> 01:59:04.170
VOTED GOVERNMENT OVER REACH IS

01:59:04.237 --> 01:59:05.438
QUITE THE OPPOSITE THIS IS A

01:59:05.505 --> 01:59:08.474
WAY FOR US. TO PROTECT THOSE.

01:59:08.541 --> 01:59:10.109
IN OUR PUBLIC THOSE THAT ARE

01:59:10.176 --> 01:59:11.744
WORKING EVERY SINGLE DAY. TO

01:59:11.811 --> 01:59:15.248
MAKE SURE THAT WE- THAT WE- CAN

01:59:15.314 --> 01:59:18.618
REMAIN SAFE SO WITH THAT I

01:59:18.684 --> 01:59:20.553

THE ROBUST DEBATE FOR AGAINST

01:59:31.297 --> 01:59:31.797
IN THOSE WHO HAVEN'T MADE A

01:59:31.864 --> 01:59:35.101
DECISION YET. AND WHAT I WANT

01:59:35.167 --> 01:59:37.336
TO REMIND EVERYBODY IT IS WE

01:59:37.403 --> 01:59:39.839
SPENT A YEAR OR SO. TALKING

01:59:39.906 --> 01:59:43.676
ABOUT EQUITY. BUT WHAT HAS

01:59:43.743 --> 01:59:45.077
HAPPENED IN NEIGHBORHOODS

01:59:45.144 --> 01:59:47.446
ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

01:59:47.513 --> 01:59:50.516
IS EVERYTHING BUT EQUITY. LET'S

01:59:50.583 --> 01:59:54.020
TALK ABOUT PEOPLE WHO HAD TO GO

01:59:54.086 --> 01:59:54.453
TO WORKING KERN ZOOM

01:59:54.520 --> 01:59:57.757
COMFORTABLY FROM HOME. LET'S

01:59:57.823 --> 02:00:01.160
TALK ABOUT PEOPLE WHO ARE FIRED

02:00:01.227 --> 02:00:03.062
THAT THEY NEED MASKS. LET'S

02:00:03.129 --> 02:00:05.231
TALK ABUT THE HUNDREDS OF

02:00:05.298 --> 02:00:06.265
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO STILL

02:00:06.332 --> 02:00:08.935
HAD TO SHOW UP TO WORK. AND

02:00:09.001 --> 02:00:11.203
BARELY MADE A MINIMUM WEIGHT.

02:00:11.270 --> 02:00:14.740
WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT. FOLKS

02:00:14.807 --> 02:00:17.410
WHO IN MANY CASES WHO OWN HOMES.

02:00:17.476 --> 02:00:19.278
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FOLKS WHO

02:00:19.345 --> 02:00:21.547
ARE CONTINUOUSLY CUT HOURS

02:00:21.614 --> 02:00:23.316
DURING THE WORST OF A PANDEMIC.

02:00:23.382 --> 02:00:27.753
AND WE ALL WANT TO SEE I GET IT

02:00:27.820 --> 02:00:28.821
WILL WANT TO SEE SMALL

02:00:28.888 --> 02:00:30.256
BUSINESSES CONTINUE TO THRIVE

02:00:30.323 --> 02:00:33.826
IN CALIFORNIA. BUT THEN I WILL

02:00:33.893 --> 02:00:36.095
ADMIT THAT THEY ARE GOOD ACTORS

02:00:36.162 --> 02:00:38.731
OUT THERE NO WAS NEGATING THAT.

02:00:38.798 --> 02:00:41.067
BUT WHAT WE SAW ACOSTA CALVIN

02:00:41.133 --> 02:00:43.703
WHAT WE SAW IN OUR BACKYARDS

02:00:43.769 --> 02:00:45.738
WHAT I SAW IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS.

02:00:45.805 --> 02:00:47.506
WHERE THE LARGE CHAIN FAST FOOD

02:00:47.573 --> 02:00:50.343
COMPANIES WHO MADE HISTORIC

02:00:50.409 --> 02:00:52.044
PROFITS BECAUSE WHEN WE ALL

02:00:52.111 --> 02:00:52.645
DROVE AROUND OUR NEIGHBORHOODS

02:00:52.712 --> 02:00:55.514
WE SAW. THAT DOES IN SOME CASES

02:00:55.581 --> 02:00:57.483
A SMALL BUSINESSES CLOSED. THE

02:00:57.550 --> 02:00:59.018
ONES WHO MADE ON PRESIDENT OF

02:00:59.085 --> 02:01:01.387
PROFITS WERE THE ONES WHO ALSO

02:01:01.454 --> 02:01:03.923
TREATED IN MANY CASES THE

02:01:03.990 --> 02:01:04.490
WORKERS THE WORST AND WE SAW

02:01:04.557 --> 02:01:07.627
THIS. WE SPENT OVER A YEAR

SOMEBODY SAID THAT THEY MAY BE

UNHEALTHY WORK STANDARDS BUT

02:01:19.939 --> 02:01:21.240

02:03:17.490 --> 02:03:19.625
ONCE I WENT HUNGRY EVERY NIGHT.

02:03:19.692 --> 02:03:20.926
THEY DON'T OFTEN HAVE THAT

02:03:20.993 --> 02:03:23.462
ABILITY TO DO OR THAT VOICE.

02:03:23.529 --> 02:03:24.163

ALL THE STUFF THAT'S BEING PUT.

02:03:49.588 --> 02:03:52.324
IN OUR FOOD- BUT I DO THINK

02:03:52.391 --> 02:03:55.227
THAT THIS IS A BAIL WHERE ALL

02:03:55.294 --> 02:03:57.329
OF THE ARGUMENTS IN FAVOR ARE

02:03:57.396 --> 02:03:59.365
ACTUALLY ARGUMENTS AGAINST FOR

COLLEAGUE FROM RANCHO CORDOVA

THAT IF THESE PROBLEMS REALLY

02:04:04.303 --> 02:04:06.205
ARE SO SEVERE THAN THEY DESERVE

02:04:06.272 --> 02:04:08.073
TO BE TREATED WITH THE DIGNITY.

02:04:08.140 --> 02:04:10.009
OF THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS

02:04:10.075 --> 02:04:11.076
WHICH CAN PRODUCE CHANGE IT IS

02:04:11.143 --> 02:04:13.846
NOT JUST LEGAL AND JURIDICAL

02:04:13.913 --> 02:04:15.848
BUT CULTURAL IS MORE DURABLE

02:04:15.915 --> 02:04:18.150
MORE MEANINGFUL. WHEREAS WE

02:04:18.217 --> 02:04:21.153
ABDICATE OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO

02:04:21.220 --> 02:04:22.988
SOME UNELECTED BOARD THAT

02:04:23.055 --> 02:04:26.325

THE GOVERNOR THIS IS NOT JUST

02:06:25.811 --> 02:06:27.513
SOME RANDOM BOARD THAT THAT

02:06:27.579 --> 02:06:29.648
WILL MAKE DECISIONS. AND IT'LL

02:06:29.715 --> 02:06:32.851

INCLUDES OSHA AND LABOR

02:06:36.855 --> 02:06:38.691
COMMISSIONER BECAUSE IT'S TRUE

02:06:38.757 --> 02:06:40.526
WE DO NEED BETTER ENFORCEMENT

OF EXISTING LAWS WE DO NEED

02:06:42.761 --> 02:06:45.497
BETTER LAWS QUITE FRANKLY AND

02:06:45.564 --> 02:06:46.765
ALL OF THESE ARE PROBLEMS. IN

02:06:46.832 --> 02:06:48.000
THE PAST WHEN THE REASONS IT'S

02:06:48.067 --> 02:06:49.768
SO IMPORTANT FOR THE WORKER TO

02:06:49.835 --> 02:06:52.371
HAVE EIGHT A SECTORIAL COUNCIL

02:06:52.438 --> 02:06:53.906
IS WE'VE NEVER PROVIDED WORKERS

02:06:53.973 --> 02:06:55.808
WITH THE VOICE YES WE CAN PASS

02:06:55.874 --> 02:06:57.943
THINGS HERE. AND I CAN TELL YOU

02:06:58.010 --> 02:06:59.845
WHAT THE WORKERS THINK ARE ONCE

02:06:59.912 --> 02:07:00.879
BUT UNTIL THE WORKERS

02:07:00.946 --> 02:07:02.548
THEMSELVES HAVE A VOICE IT'S

02:07:02.614 --> 02:07:04.383
POINTLESS. THEY'RE NOT

02:07:04.450 --> 02:07:07.619
EMPOWERED TO SUGGEST IT LIKE WE

02:07:07.686 --> 02:07:09.455
HEARD FROM PEOPLE WHO WORKED.

02:07:09.521 --> 02:07:10.956
IN FAST FOOD RESTAURANTS TO

02:07:11.023 --> 02:07:12.791
TALK ABOUT WHAT IT IS THAT

02:07:12.858 --> 02:07:14.393
THEY'RE FACING TO TALK ABOUT

02:07:14.460 --> 02:07:15.461
WHAT IT IS THAT THEY NEED AND

02:07:15.527 --> 02:07:16.662
WHAT TYPES OF SUPPORT THEY

02:07:16.729 --> 02:07:18.230
NEED. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SEEKING

02:07:18.297 --> 02:07:20.299
TO DO IN THIS BILL. I AM MORE

02:07:20.366 --> 02:07:21.767
THAN HAPPY I DON'T KNOW OUR

02:07:21.834 --> 02:07:26.038
DOCTOR COURT- MY COLLEAGUE-

02:07:26.105 --> 02:07:27.039
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA SINCE I'M

02:07:27.106 --> 02:07:28.640
SO GOOD WHICH WELL I THINK. AND

02:07:28.707 --> 02:07:31.176
I AM ABSOLUTELY COMMITTED TO

02:07:31.243 --> 02:07:32.611
WORKING ON A PIECE OF

02:07:32.678 --> 02:07:34.346
LEGISLATIVE RUBIO AND I

02:07:34.413 --> 02:07:35.781
UNDERSTAND WHY THAT MAKES

02:07:35.848 --> 02:07:38.117
PEOPLE NERVOUS RIGHT WE'RE NOT

02:07:38.183 --> 02:07:40.085
USED TO SAYING. ARE WE DON'T

02:07:40.152 --> 02:07:41.220
THINK WE'RE USED TO SAYING A

02:07:41.286 --> 02:07:42.521
COUNCIL COULD MAKE THESE

02:07:42.588 --> 02:07:43.689
DECISIONS BUT I DO WANT TO

02:07:43.756 --> 02:07:46.525
REMIND THIS THIS FLOOR. THAT

02:07:46.592 --> 02:07:47.626
FOR NINETY YEARS IN CALIFORNIA

02:07:47.693 --> 02:07:49.261
WE HAD A WAGE BOARD FOR NINETY

02:07:49.328 --> 02:07:51.397
YEARS AND APPOINTED WAGE BOARD

02:07:51.463 --> 02:07:53.565
THAT MADE ALL THE DECISIONS. ON

02:07:53.632 --> 02:07:55.701
ON WAGE ORDERS. THIS IS NOT A

02:07:55.768 --> 02:07:58.170
NEW IDEA IT IS SOMETHING THAT

02:07:58.237 --> 02:08:02.841
WE TOOK IN FACT FROM THOSE WAGE.

02:08:02.908 --> 02:08:03.475
ORDER THE WHAT THE WAGE BOARD.

02:08:03.542 --> 02:08:04.877
THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS

02:08:04.943 --> 02:08:06.812
BECAUSE THE UNITED STATES HAS

02:08:06.879 --> 02:08:08.614
NEVER SEEN SOMETHING LIKE THIS

02:08:08.680 --> 02:08:10.282
WE'VE NEVER REALLY EMPOWERED

02:08:10.349 --> 02:08:12.418
WORKERS TO HAVE A VOICE

02:08:12.484 --> 02:08:14.987
THROUGH. A SECTORIAL COUNCIL.

02:08:15.054 --> 02:08:17.189
WHAT OTHER COUNTRIES DO. AND

02:08:17.256 --> 02:08:18.257
QUITE FRANKLY IT WORKS QUITE

02:08:18.323 --> 02:08:20.225
WELL THE FACT IS REMOTE REMIND

02:08:20.292 --> 02:08:21.193
BY MY COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA

02:08:21.260 --> 02:08:23.328
BARBARA. SAID IN OTHER

02:08:23.395 --> 02:08:24.863
COUNTRIES AT THE SAME

02:08:24.930 --> 02:08:27.299
RESTAURANTS. THEY THEY ARE

02:08:27.366 --> 02:08:28.667
EITHER WORKERS PROBABLY NOT

02:08:28.734 --> 02:08:30.035
TWICE AS MUCH AS THEY DO HERE

02:08:30.102 --> 02:08:31.537
BECAUSE THEY NOT ONLY GET WAGE

02:08:31.603 --> 02:08:33.172
INCREASES BUT THEY ALSO HAVE

02:08:33.238 --> 02:08:35.207
PAID SICK DAYS AND HOLIDAYS IN

02:08:35.274 --> 02:08:38.243
HEALTH CARE. IN A BIG MAC COSTS

02:08:38.310 --> 02:08:40.045
ABOUT TWENTY SEVEN CENTS MORE.

02:08:40.112 --> 02:08:42.181
ALL RIGHT SO THERE ARE THIS

02:08:42.247 --> 02:08:44.483
SEEMS TO WORK IN OTHER PLACES.

02:08:44.550 --> 02:08:46.251
TAILORING IT TO FIT WHAT WE'RE

WORKING LONGER IN STEYNING JOB

02:29:42.340 --> 02:29:43.140
THEY MIGHT WANT TO LEAVE

02:29:43.207 --> 02:29:44.909
BECAUSE OF HEALTH BENEFITS WE

02:29:44.975 --> 02:29:46.177
NEED TO DO SOMETHING TO CHANGE

02:29:46.243 --> 02:29:48.179
THESE THINGS. MOST OF YOU

02:29:48.245 --> 02:29:49.213
RECALL THAT A COUPLE OF YEARS

02:29:49.280 --> 02:29:50.748
AGO THERE WAS LEGISLATION THAT

02:29:50.815 --> 02:29:51.949
WOULD HAVE REGULATED RATES

02:29:52.016 --> 02:29:53.718
WITHIN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM

02:29:53.784 --> 02:29:55.086
LET ME BE CLEAR THIS BILL DOES

02:29:55.152 --> 02:29:57.888
NOT DO THAT. AB ELEVEN THIRTIES

02:29:57.955 --> 02:29:59.357
APPROACH IS BASED ON DATA AND

02:29:59.423 --> 02:30:01.192
TRANSPARENCY BY CREATING OFFICE

02:30:01.258 --> 02:30:02.993
RESPONSIBLE FOR COLLECTING AND

02:30:03.060 --> 02:30:04.895
ANALYZING MARKET INFORMATION

02:30:04.962 --> 02:30:06.664
AND ESTABLISHING COST SECTOR A

02:30:06.731 --> 02:30:08.799
SECTOR COST TARGETS. WE HAVE

02:30:08.866 --> 02:30:10.267
ACCEPTED A MENACE FROM EVERY

02:30:10.334 --> 02:30:12.203
STAKEHOLDER GROUP IS OFFERED

02:30:12.269 --> 02:30:14.505
THEM PRO AND CON AND WE

02:30:14.572 --> 02:30:16.707
ACCEPTED EVERY MINUTE NO BUT

02:30:16.774 --> 02:30:18.109
OUR PROCESS HAS BEEN OPEN

02:30:18.175 --> 02:30:19.710
COLLABORATIVE AND WILL CONTINUE

02:30:19.777 --> 02:30:20.578
TO BE THAT WAY AS WE MOVE

02:30:20.644 --> 02:30:22.580
FORWARD. THE COST OF HEALTHCARE

02:30:22.646 --> 02:30:23.681
SPENDING HAS BEEN RISING BY

02:30:23.748 --> 02:30:25.649
TWICE THE RATE OF INFLATION

02:30:25.716 --> 02:30:26.884
SINCE MY FIRST YEAR IN THE

02:30:26.951 --> 02:30:28.619
LEGISLATURE IN TWENTY FIFTEEN.

02:30:28.686 --> 02:30:29.887
WE NEED TO WORK TO CORRECT HIS

02:30:29.954 --> 02:30:33.057
ALARMING TREND WHILE WORKING TO

02:30:33.124 --> 02:30:33.657
INCREASE QUALITY AND ACCESS TO

02:30:33.724 --> 02:30:36.827
CARE. ACCORDING TO AN OCTOBER

02:30:36.894 --> 02:30:37.995
TWENTY NINETEEN ARTICLE IN THE

02:30:38.062 --> 02:30:38.996
JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL

02:30:39.063 --> 02:30:41.432
ASSOCIATION. ABOUT TWENTY FIVE

02:30:41.499 --> 02:30:44.502
PERCENT. OF EVERY DOLLAR SPENT

02:30:44.568 --> 02:30:46.637
ON HEALTHCARE IS WASTED. THINK

02:30:46.704 --> 02:30:49.607
ABOUT THAT IF YOU TRANSLATE

02:30:49.673 --> 02:30:50.708
THAT TO CALIFORNIA THAT'S

02:30:50.775 --> 02:30:53.043
BETWEEN FIFTY EIGHT AND SEVENTY

02:30:53.110 --> 02:30:54.745
THREE BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR

02:30:54.812 --> 02:30:57.248
THAT'S WASTED MARGINAL DISK

02:30:57.314 --> 02:30:59.116
DECREASES IN WAIST ALONE WOULD

02:30:59.183 --> 02:31:01.152
LIKELY BRING SPENDING CLOSER TO

02:31:01.218 --> 02:31:02.253
OR LOWER THAN THE RATE OF

02:31:02.319 --> 02:31:04.488
INFLATION WE NEED THE SYSTEM TO

02:31:04.555 --> 02:31:06.390
BE BEGIN TO THINK AND ACT

02:31:06.457 --> 02:31:07.258
DIFFERENTLY THAT'S THE GOAL

02:31:07.324 --> 02:31:09.460
HERE. DATE AND TRANSPARENCY THE

02:31:09.527 --> 02:31:10.928
KEYS TO UNDERSTANDING IMPROVING

02:31:10.995 --> 02:31:13.330
OUR SYSTEM WE CAN'T FIX WHAT WE

02:31:13.397 --> 02:31:15.032
DON'T UNDERSTAND. WE WILL

02:31:15.099 --> 02:31:15.800
CONTINUE TO WORK WITH

02:31:15.866 --> 02:31:17.134
STAKEHOLDERS ON THIS ISSUE AS I

02:31:17.201 --> 02:31:19.036
DO WITH EVERYONE OF MY BILLS.

02:31:19.103 --> 02:31:20.571
MEMBERS I HOPE YOU WILL SUPPORT

02:31:20.638 --> 02:31:21.639
THE EIGHT INTENT OF YOUR

02:31:21.705 --> 02:31:23.073
CONSTITUENTS WHO BELIEVE THAT

02:31:23.140 --> 02:31:24.542
TACKLING GROWING COST OF HEALTH

02:31:24.608 --> 02:31:27.178
CARE IS AN EXTREMELY. OR VERY

02:31:27.244 --> 02:31:27.912
IMPORTANT PRIORITY FOR THE

02:31:27.978 --> 02:31:30.481
GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE

02:31:30.548 --> 02:31:31.115
WITHOUT A RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR

THIRTY NINE YEARS IN THE HEALTH

02:31:41.492 --> 02:31:43.961
INSURANCE BUSINESS. DESIGNING

02:31:44.028 --> 02:31:46.997
HEALTH PLANS DOING ACTUARIAL

02:31:47.064 --> 02:31:49.233
STUDIES WORKING VERY CLOSELY

02:31:49.300 --> 02:31:51.235
WITH MANY OF THE MAJOR

02:31:51.302 --> 02:31:53.704
INSURANCE COMPANIES. WHEN I

02:31:53.771 --> 02:31:55.539
FIRST WENT INTO THE BUSINESS

02:31:55.606 --> 02:31:57.174
THERE WAS OVER THIRTY FIVE

02:31:57.241 --> 02:31:58.943
INSURANCE COMPANIES IN

02:31:59.009 --> 02:32:01.178
CALIFORNIA DOING. HEALTH

02:32:01.245 --> 02:32:07.017
INSURANCE NOW THERE'S LESS THAN

02:32:07.084 --> 02:32:08.586
ELEVEN OR TWELVE DEPENDING UPON

02:32:08.652 --> 02:32:11.522
THE AREA SOME AREAS ONLY HAVE

02:32:11.589 --> 02:32:15.259
ONE. PROVIDER SOME HAVE TWO OR

02:32:15.326 --> 02:32:19.530
THREE SO THE MORE YOU TRY TO

02:32:19.597 --> 02:32:22.533
CONTROL HEALTH COSTS. THE MORE

02:32:22.600 --> 02:32:26.203
YOU WILL BE. ACTUALLY MAKING

02:32:26.270 --> 02:32:28.873
THE PROBLEM WORSE HERE'S WHY

02:32:28.939 --> 02:32:30.274
THERE IS DISPARITY THROUGHOUT

02:32:30.341 --> 02:32:32.243
CALIFORNIA BECAUSE IS A BIG

02:32:32.309 --> 02:32:34.979
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN UCLA MEDICAL

02:32:35.045 --> 02:32:38.716
CENTER AND ANOTHER SMALLER

02:32:38.782 --> 02:32:43.921
MEDICAL CENTER SOMEWHERE ELSE.

02:32:43.988 --> 02:32:46.090
YOU HAVE CYCLES IN THE

02:32:46.156 --> 02:32:48.259
INSURANCE BUSINESS THERE ARE

02:32:48.325 --> 02:32:50.661
CYCLES WHERE RATES ARE SOMEWHAT

02:32:50.728 --> 02:32:53.397
STEADY OTHER TIMES REACTING TO

02:32:53.464 --> 02:32:56.634
MARKET FORCES THE RATES GO UP.

02:32:56.700 --> 02:32:58.869
MANY TIMES CORPORATIONS WILL

02:32:58.936 --> 02:33:01.872
SELF INSURE. IF THEY SELF

02:33:01.939 --> 02:33:04.975
INSURE IT DEPENDS UPON THEIR

02:33:05.042 --> 02:33:07.811
ACTUARIAL EXPERIENCE AS FAR AS

02:33:07.878 --> 02:33:10.080
THEIR CLAIMS GO IF CLAIMS ARE

02:33:10.147 --> 02:33:12.383
HIGH YOU HAVE TO RAISE YOUR

02:33:12.449 --> 02:33:15.119
PREMIUMS NOW THAT BRINGS ME

02:33:15.185 --> 02:33:20.057
ALSO TO A POINT. OUR.

02:33:20.124 --> 02:33:22.626
POPULATION IS AGING. AND

02:33:22.693 --> 02:33:25.262
BETWEEN AGE FIFTY FIVE IN EIGHT

02:33:25.329 --> 02:33:27.831
SIXTY TWO BEFORE SOMEBODY OR

02:33:27.898 --> 02:33:28.432
SIXTY FIVE BEFORE SOMEBODY CAN

02:33:28.499 --> 02:33:30.501
GO ON MEDICARE THAT IS THE

02:33:30.568 --> 02:33:34.238
HIGHEST MOST EXPENSIVE BRACKET.

02:33:34.305 --> 02:33:36.674
THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE HAS

02:33:36.740 --> 02:33:40.844
TO APPROVE. ANY RATE INCREASES

02:33:40.911 --> 02:33:43.347
AND THAT IS A ELABORATE DANCE

02:33:43.414 --> 02:33:45.316
THAT'S DONE BETWEEN COMPANIES

02:33:45.382 --> 02:33:48.085
PROVIDERS EVERYBODY. SO WE

02:33:48.152 --> 02:33:51.622
ALREADY HAVE REGULATORY RULES

02:33:51.689 --> 02:33:54.191

02:34:07.004 --> 02:34:09.273
INSURANCE MARKET PLACE THAT WE

02:34:09.340 --> 02:34:12.309
REALLY DON'T NEED RATES ARE

02:34:12.376 --> 02:34:13.577
GONNA GO UP NO MATTER WHAT.

02:34:13.644 --> 02:34:17.014
BECAUSE THAT IS THE NATURE OF

02:34:17.081 --> 02:34:20.117
THE BEAST IT WILL BE TWO TO

02:34:20.184 --> 02:34:22.620
THREE TIMES HIGHER THAN CPI

02:34:22.686 --> 02:34:25.589
THAT IS SIMPLY IT. RIGHT NOW

02:34:25.656 --> 02:34:29.126
WE'RE SPENDING ALMOST 18% OF

02:34:29.193 --> 02:34:31.662
OUR GDP ON HEALTHCARE. IT WILL

02:34:31.729 --> 02:34:37.034

04:28:19.316 --> 04:28:20.717
BROWN AND BLACK COMMUNITIES

04:28:20.784 --> 04:28:22.886
DISPROPORTIONATELY. MANY THOSE

04:28:22.953 --> 04:28:24.621
COMMUNITY GUIDELINES EVERY

04:28:24.688 --> 04:28:27.925
SINGLE DAY. AND WE ARE LEAVING

04:28:27.991 --> 04:28:29.560
THESE COMMUNITIES BEHIND BY NOT

04:28:29.626 --> 04:28:31.528
INVESTING IN THESE PROGRAMS AND

04:28:31.595 --> 04:28:33.430
THAT IS ON ALL OF US RIGHT NOW

04:28:33.497 --> 04:28:35.098
TO MAKE A DECISION THAT WE'RE

04:28:35.165 --> 04:28:35.599
GOING TO INVEST IN THESE

04:28:35.666 --> 04:28:37.668
PROGRAMS. BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT

04:28:37.734 --> 04:28:40.604
THEY WORK. SO I UNDERSTAND IT'S

04:28:40.671 --> 04:28:43.340
A TOUGH VOTE FOR SOME FOLKS BUT

04:28:43.407 --> 04:28:43.941
I'M ASKING YOU TO HAVE COURAGE

04:28:44.007 --> 04:28:45.442
TO MAKE THAT VOTE. AND TO

04:28:45.509 --> 04:28:46.477
INVEST IN A RUN ABOUT

04:28:46.543 --> 04:28:48.145
COMMUNITIES THAT BEEN LEFT

04:28:48.212 --> 04:28:51.248
BEHIND FOR FAR TOO LONG. I

04:28:51.315 --> 04:28:53.150
WOULD HUMBLY ASK THAT YOU VOTE

04:28:53.217 --> 04:28:57.821
FIVE UNTIL TWENTY THREE. THANK

04:28:57.888 --> 04:28:59.456
YOU MISS WICKS MISTER MATHIS

04:28:59.523 --> 04:29:05.062
YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU

04:29:05.128 --> 04:29:12.402
MISTER SPEAKER. I THANK GOD. A

04:29:12.469 --> 04:29:14.137
LOT OF US HAVE A LOT OF

04:29:14.204 --> 04:29:17.407
SYMPATHY. WHAT EMPATHY

04:29:17.474 --> 04:29:22.045
COMPASSION FOR THE VICTIMS IN

04:29:22.112 --> 04:29:22.613
THE FAMILIES RELATED TO GUN

04:29:22.679 --> 04:29:27.885
VIOLENCE. WHAT THIS BILL DOES

04:29:27.951 --> 04:29:30.554
IS IT DOESN'T STOP. THOSE ROOT

04:29:30.621 --> 04:29:33.891
CAUSES THE THESE THINGS LIKE

04:29:33.957 --> 04:29:40.564
POVERTY. MENTAL HEALTH. THE

04:29:40.631 --> 04:29:43.133
THINGS THAT DRIVE PEOPLE TO THE

04:29:43.200 --> 04:29:46.069
POINT WHERE THEY USE A TOOL TO

04:29:46.136 --> 04:29:49.039
HARM OTHERS. THIS BILL DOESN'T

04:29:49.106 --> 04:29:53.143
STOP THAT. WHAT THIS BILL DOES

04:29:53.210 --> 04:29:56.647
IS CREATE A TAX THAT'S GOING TO

04:29:56.713 --> 04:29:59.449
DRIVE UP THE COST. LET'S ALSO

04:29:59.516 --> 04:30:02.553
CONSIDER SOME FACTS OVER 60% OF

04:30:02.619 --> 04:30:07.791
GUN RELATED DEATHS OR SUICIDES.

04:30:07.858 --> 04:30:09.693
WHICH CUTS DEEP FOR ME

04:30:09.760 --> 04:30:11.962
PERSONALLY. BECAUSE I'VE LOST

04:30:12.029 --> 04:30:14.298
MORE FRIENDS TO SUICIDE THAT I

04:30:14.364 --> 04:30:18.135
HAVE FROM COMBAT. LET'S ALSO

04:30:18.201 --> 04:30:21.438
THINK OF ANOTHER FAT. THE

04:30:21.505 --> 04:30:23.040
PEOPLE WHO DEFEND THEMSELVES

04:30:23.106 --> 04:30:25.876
WITH GUNS ARE LESS LIKELY TO BE

04:30:25.943 --> 04:30:30.480
KILLED OR INJURED. IN A CRIME.

04:30:30.547 --> 04:30:33.116
SO WITH THIS BILL ARE ARE YOU

04:30:33.183 --> 04:30:35.252
TAKING AWAY THE ABILITY. BY

04:30:35.319 --> 04:30:36.720
DRIVING UP THE COST OF

04:30:36.787 --> 04:30:39.756
AMMUNITION. BECAUSE NOW PEOPLE

04:30:39.823 --> 04:30:41.224
DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THAT

04:30:41.291 --> 04:30:42.859
BECAUSE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN

04:30:42.926 --> 04:30:45.062
POVERTY PEOPLE LETTER FOR AREAS

04:30:45.128 --> 04:30:48.198
OF OUR STATE LIKE MINE. WHO ARE

04:30:48.265 --> 04:30:50.334
RESPONSIBLE GUN OWNERS WHO WANT

04:30:50.400 --> 04:30:51.935
TO PROTECT THEMSELVES AND

04:30:52.002 --> 04:30:54.037
PROTECT THEM FOR FAMILY PROTECT.

04:30:54.104 --> 04:30:57.274
THEIR PROPERTY. ARE GOING TO

04:30:57.341 --> 04:31:00.410
HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO SO. IT

04:31:00.477 --> 04:31:02.079
YOU KNOW THE CURRENT JOKE OF

04:31:02.145 --> 04:31:03.513
TODAY IS THE MOST EXPENSIVE

04:31:03.580 --> 04:31:05.949
DATE OUT THERE'S TO GO SHOOT A

04:31:06.016 --> 04:31:06.550
NINE MILLIMETER AT A PIECE OF

04:31:06.617 --> 04:31:10.554
PLYWOOD. BECAUSE OF THE COST.

04:31:10.621 --> 04:31:15.959
THAT'S A FACT. SO WE JUST GOING

04:31:16.026 --> 04:31:18.095
TO CONTINUE TO BE TAX A FORMULA.

04:31:18.161 --> 04:31:19.529
THEY JUST THROW ANOTHER TAX OUT

04:31:19.596 --> 04:31:20.731
THERE ANOTHER PROBLEM

04:31:20.797 --> 04:31:22.633
ESPECIALLY WHEN WE ALREADY HAVE

04:31:22.699 --> 04:31:25.602
A MASSIVE BUDGET SURPLUS. IS

04:31:25.669 --> 04:31:27.170
ANOTHER TAX TRULY WHAT Y'ALL

04:31:27.237 --> 04:31:30.807
WANT. I'M GONNA STAND WITH THE

04:31:30.874 --> 04:31:32.342
ABILITY TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE CAN

04:31:32.409 --> 04:31:34.511
PROTECT THEMSELVES AND WE NEED

04:31:34.578 --> 04:31:36.146
TO LOOK AT OTHER WAYS TO

04:31:36.213 --> 04:31:37.614
ADDRESS POVERTY. TO ADDRESS

04:31:37.681 --> 04:31:40.951
MENTAL HEALTH. THE STOP

04:31:41.018 --> 04:31:43.620
VIOLENCE AS A WHOLE. WHETHER

04:31:43.687 --> 04:31:45.922
IT'S WITH A GUN A KNIFE

04:31:45.989 --> 04:31:48.291
WHATEVER WE HAVE A VIOLENCE

04:31:48.358 --> 04:31:51.862
PROBLEM THAT'S A FACT. WHILE

04:31:51.928 --> 04:31:53.430
WE'RE AT IT LET'S CONSIDER SOME

04:31:53.497 --> 04:31:55.599
OF THE LOGIC THAT WE'VE HEARD.

04:31:55.666 --> 04:31:56.900
BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO START

04:31:56.967 --> 04:31:58.635
TAXING THEM TO PAY FOR GUN

04:31:58.702 --> 04:32:00.804
VIOLENCE WHY ARE WE GONNA TAX

04:32:00.871 --> 04:32:02.105
SPOONS NEXT TO PAY FOR DIABETES.

04:32:02.172 --> 04:32:12.416
THINK ABOUT IT. MS CLARK SILVA.

YES BECAUSE WE NEED TO MAKE. A

04:35:09.492 --> 04:35:12.295
STAND TO SAY ENOUGH IS ENOUGH

04:35:12.362 --> 04:35:13.964
AND WE NEED TO START TO DO

04:35:14.030 --> 04:35:15.031

COLLEAGUE FROM BY SALIA. IT'S

04:38:41.905 --> 04:38:42.605
TRUE THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF

04:38:42.672 --> 04:38:44.407
OTHER UNDERLYING ROOT CAUSES OF

04:38:52.182 --> 04:38:53.783
IN OTHER COUNTRIES. ALL OVER

04:38:53.850 --> 04:38:55.718
THE WORLD. AND YET THE EPIDEMIC

04:38:55.785 --> 04:38:57.387
OF GUN VIOLENCE IS A UNIQUELY

04:38:57.454 --> 04:38:59.589
AMERICAN PHENOMENON. CHILDREN

SO IF THIS WAS JUST ABOUT

04:39:06.629 --> 04:39:07.997
MENTAL HEALTH IF THIS WAS JUST

04:39:08.064 --> 04:39:09.365
ABOUT POVERTY IF THIS WAS JUST

04:39:09.432 --> 04:39:11.167
ABOUT INEQUALITY. THEN WE WOULD

04:39:11.234 --> 04:39:13.069
BE IN THE SAME BOAT AS EVERY

04:39:13.136 --> 04:39:14.270

TWO IN A MINUTE BUT I WOULD

04:40:40.256 --> 04:40:41.524
GUESS THAT EVERY SEVENTY NINE

04:40:41.591 --> 04:40:42.959
PEOPLE UP HERE WANT TO REDUCE

04:40:43.026 --> 04:40:44.427
THE AMOUNT OF GUN VIOLENCE.

04:40:44.494 --> 04:40:45.461
WITH THEIR IN OUR OWN

04:40:45.528 --> 04:40:46.663
COMMUNITIES WHETHER THEY'RE

04:40:46.729 --> 04:40:48.565
BECAUSE OF SUICIDE OR VETERANS

04:40:48.631 --> 04:40:51.534

04:40:51.601 --> 04:40:54.137
UNNECESSARILY AT THE AT THE

04:40:54.204 --> 04:40:56.272
HANDS OF GUN VIOLENCE A FIRE

04:40:56.339 --> 04:40:58.041
ARE MANY TIMES. IN SOMEONE'S

04:40:58.107 --> 04:40:59.776
HANDS WHO WE ALL AGREE

04:40:59.842 --> 04:41:00.877
SHOULDN'T HAVE IN THE FIRST

04:41:00.944 --> 04:41:02.579
PLACE. I REMEMBER AS A YOUNG

04:41:02.645 --> 04:41:03.846
COUNCIL MEMBER JUST A FEW

04:41:03.913 --> 04:41:05.381
BLOCKS IN YOUR EYES TO GET

04:41:05.448 --> 04:41:07.417
THESE CALLS MAYBE. EVERY OTHER

04:41:07.483 --> 04:41:08.751
MONTH FROM OUR EITHER OUR

04:41:08.818 --> 04:41:11.454
POLICE CHIEF. OR THE CAPTAIN IN

04:41:11.521 --> 04:41:12.889
MY CITY COUNCIL DISTRICT AND

04:41:12.956 --> 04:41:14.958
EVERY TIME THAT PHONE RANG. I

04:41:15.024 --> 04:41:16.559
DIDN'T WANT TO ANSWER THE CALL

04:41:16.626 --> 04:41:17.060
BECAUSE I KNEW THERE ARE

04:41:17.126 --> 04:41:19.229
CALLING FOR ONE REASON. A YOUNG

04:41:19.295 --> 04:41:22.565
MAN OST LIKELY. YOUNG BROWN A

04:41:22.632 --> 04:41:23.166
BLACK MAN WAS SHOT AND KILLED

04:41:23.233 --> 04:41:25.902
IN MY DISTRICT. AND I THOUGHT

04:41:25.969 --> 04:41:26.869
THIS IS WAY TOO MUCH WHAT COULD

04:41:26.936 --> 04:41:29.539
WE DO. SO I THOUGHT TWO THINGS

04:41:29.606 --> 04:41:30.473
ONE WE WORKED ON A LOT OF

04:41:30.540 --> 04:41:32.008
REGULATE AMMUNITION SALES WITH

04:41:32.075 --> 04:41:33.543
LATER BECAME THE MODEL FOR

04:41:33.610 --> 04:41:35.712
CALIFORNIA AND TO. I THOUGHT

04:41:35.778 --> 04:41:37.847
WHAT CAN WE DO TO SPEND

04:41:37.914 --> 04:41:39.916
RESOURCES ON RESEARCH DATA

04:41:39.983 --> 04:41:42.051
DRIVEN EFFORTS THAT PREVENT GUN

04:41:42.118 --> 04:41:43.987
VIOLENCE. WE HAVE A PROGRAM

04:41:44.053 --> 04:41:45.255
IGHT HERE THAT WE TALKED ABOUT

04:41:45.321 --> 04:41:47.657
EARLIER THE CAL THE CALVET

04:41:47.724 --> 04:41:49.492
PROGRAM FUNDS ADVANCE PEACE

04:41:49.559 --> 04:41:50.727
WHICH WE KNOW WORKS. WHICH WE

04:41:50.793 --> 04:41:54.430
KNOW WORKS. OUR COLLEAGUE MORAN

04:41:54.497 --> 04:41:55.865
IS BRING THIS ISSUE UP SIGN TO

04:41:55.932 --> 04:41:57.734
ISSUE MY PREDECESSOR OFFERED

04:41:57.800 --> 04:41:59.335
THIS BILL FIVE YEARS AGO. BUT

04:41:59.402 --> 04:42:00.870
NOW THE TIME THAT WE CAN REALLY

04:42:00.937 --> 04:42:02.505
TAKE A LOOK AS FAR AS WHAT.

04:42:02.572 --> 04:42:05.708
REALLY WORKS TO STOP THE FLOW

04:42:05.775 --> 04:42:07.343
OF GUNS TO OUR COMMUNITIES AND

04:42:07.410 --> 04:42:09.746
STOP GUN VIOLENCE. SO LET'S GET

04:42:09.812 --> 04:42:11.781
BACK TO THE ISSUE OF THE SECOND

04:42:11.848 --> 04:42:13.116
AMENDMENT. SO THE LETTERSIN

04:42:13.182 --> 04:42:14.617
THE OPPOSITION SAYS THIS IS A

04:42:14.684 --> 04:42:16.352
RIGHT THEY CAN'T BE INFRINGED

04:42:16.419 --> 04:42:18.154
UPON. WE'RE NOT INFRINGING UPON

04:42:18.221 --> 04:42:21.024
IT. YOU CAN STILL HAVE THE

04:42:21.090 --> 04:42:24.060
RIGHT TO PURCHASE A FIREARM.

04:42:24.127 --> 04:42:25.929
AMMUNITION. SO WE GET TO

04:42:25.995 --> 04:42:28.798
TAXATION WE KNOW THERE ARE SOME

04:42:28.865 --> 04:42:30.933
PRODUCTS IN SOCIETY WHICH WE

04:42:31.000 --> 04:42:33.269
PAY SALES TAX FOR BUT IS ALSO

04:42:33.336 --> 04:42:35.938
IMPACTS AS WELL. SOME PRODUCTS

04:42:36.005 --> 04:42:37.640
HAVE NEGATIVE EXTERNALITIES

04:42:37.707 --> 04:42:39.409
WHICH TO PAY AN EXTRA TAX ON.

04:42:39.475 --> 04:42:42.445
THINK ABOUT TV'S. BATTERIES

04:42:42.512 --> 04:42:45.148
PAINT MATTRESSES YOU PAY SALES

04:42:45.214 --> 04:42:46.916
TAX AND YOU PAY A FEW EXTRA

04:42:46.983 --> 04:42:49.185
PENNIES PER DOLLAR PER PURCHASE

04:42:49.252 --> 04:42:51.521
WHY BECAUSE SALES TAX IS NOT

04:42:51.587 --> 04:42:54.290
ENOUGH. TO ADDRESS THE CARNAGE

04:42:54.357 --> 04:42:55.625
THAT THAT TAKES PLACE BECAUSE

04:42:55.692 --> 04:42:56.626
OF THIS PRODUCT WE'RE NOT

04:42:56.693 --> 04:42:58.294
SAYING THAT ALL AMMUNITION AND

04:42:58.361 --> 04:43:00.096
GUN SALES COULD PROVIDE

04:43:00.163 --> 04:43:01.931
NEGATIVE THINGS IN SOCIETY. A

04:43:01.998 --> 04:43:04.367
LOT OF TIMES THEY DO AND SO A

04:43:04.434 --> 04:43:06.102
LITTLE EXTRA FOR YOUR PURCHASE.

04:43:06.169 --> 04:43:07.770
WHAT COULD I DO IT COULD STOP A

04:43:07.837 --> 04:43:08.905
DEATH IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS

04:43:08.971 --> 04:43:10.873
NEIGHBORS OF CARSON IT COULD

04:43:10.940 --> 04:43:13.142
ALSO STOP SUICIDE. THESE MONIES

04:43:13.209 --> 04:43:14.944
CAN E SPENT ON RESEARCH DRIVEN

04:43:15.011 --> 04:43:17.880
EFFORTS TO STOP GUN VIOLENCE

04:43:17.947 --> 04:43:19.515
THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. THIS IS

04:43:19.582 --> 04:43:21.718
NOT SOME CRAZY CRAZY IDEA SURE

04:43:21.784 --> 04:43:23.186
THERE IS SALES TAX CURRENTLY ON

04:43:23.252 --> 04:43:25.421
FIREARM SALES HANDGUNS LONG

04:43:25.488 --> 04:43:27.423
GUNS AND AMMUNITION. BUT ALSO

04:43:27.490 --> 04:43:29.826
MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A- LONG

04:43:29.892 --> 04:43:32.462

THE BUDGET LAST FEW YEARS. AND

04:43:39.435 --> 04:43:40.770
RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT THESE

04:43:40.837 --> 04:43:43.005
PROGRAMS WORK AND REDUCE GUN

04:43:43.072 --> 04:43:44.974

04:44:10.967 --> 04:44:13.636

04:44:15.972 --> 04:44:18.040
PROGRAM AND IT'S VERY EFFECTIVE

04:44:18.107 --> 04:44:19.709
AND IT SHOULD BE FUNDED WHAT WE

04:44:19.776 --> 04:44:21.644

04:44:21.711 --> 04:44:23.446
SOMETHING THAT OUR ENTIRE

SOCIETY IN CALIFORNIA. HAS

04:44:25.815 --> 04:44:28.251
ALREADY ALREADY GIVEN TO AND

04:44:28.317 --> 04:44:31.254
THAT'S OUR TAXES WE HAVE THIRTY

04:44:36.692 --> 04:44:38.661
THIS PROGRAM AS MUCH AS WE WANT

04:44:38.728 --> 04:44:40.630
IF THIS IS THAT IMPORTANT THEN

04:44:40.696 --> 04:44:43.566
LET'S DO IT. BUT TRYING TO TAX

04:44:43.633 --> 04:44:47.270

04:44:47.336 --> 04:44:49.205
CERTAIN GROUP OF PEOPLE IS

GOING TO DO THIS IT'S GOING TO

04:44:51.140 --> 04:44:53.109
DRIVE THOSE PEOPLE OUT. THEY

04:44:53.176 --> 04:44:54.811
WILL DIVIDE THEIR THEIR GUNS ON

04:44:54.877 --> 04:44:56.279

WHEREVER IT IS AND YOU WILL NOT

04:45:00.516 --> 04:45:02.418
SEE THAT REVENUE. SO IF THIS IS

04:45:02.485 --> 04:45:05.087
IMPORTANT. FOR PETE'S SAKE

04:45:05.154 --> 04:45:07.256
FUNDING. THAT'S WHAT THAT

04:45:07.323 --> 04:45:08.491
THIRTY EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS

04:45:08.558 --> 04:45:10.159
GIVES US THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO.

04:45:10.226 --> 04:45:12.128
DON'T STAND HERE AND TELL US

04:45:12.195 --> 04:45:13.863

04:45:13.930 --> 04:45:15.865
BECAUSE IT IS. WE WANT GUN

GOING TO DO IT WITH THE PROGRAM

04:45:21.904 --> 04:45:23.072
THE ALL IT DOES IS SAY WE'RE

04:45:23.139 --> 04:45:25.775
GOING TO TAX THESE FOLKS 10% OR

04:45:25.842 --> 04:45:27.643
ELEVEN PERCENT. FOR EXERCISING

04:45:27.710 --> 04:45:29.979
THEIR SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHT.

04:45:30.046 --> 04:45:31.214
FOR PETE'S SAKE THAT'S JUST A

04:45:31.280 --> 04:45:33.249
PUNISHMENT FOR DOING THAT. AND

04:45:33.316 --> 04:45:35.785
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO TAKE IT

04:45:35.852 --> 04:45:36.652
THOSE PEOPLE WILL GO AWAY. WELL

04:46:05.047 --> 04:46:08.284
MISTER SPEAKER- I'VE BEEN A GUN

04:46:08.351 --> 04:46:10.786
OWNER AND SHOOTER FOR FIFTY

04:46:10.853 --> 04:46:12.522
YEARS MY FATHER TAUGHT ME WHEN

04:46:12.588 --> 04:46:16.459
I WAS ELEVEN YEARS OLD. AND I

04:46:16.526 --> 04:46:17.426
PROBABLY HAVE MORE GUNS THAN

04:46:17.493 --> 04:46:21.197
MOST OF THE REPUBLICANS IN HERE.

04:46:21.264 --> 04:46:23.099
AND I PROBABLY SHOOT A LOT MORE

04:46:23.165 --> 04:46:26.869
TO- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS

04:46:26.936 --> 04:46:29.071
ALWAYS BEEN CONCERNING TO ME AS

04:46:29.138 --> 04:46:30.339
WE HAVE NEVER TAKEN THE

04:46:30.406 --> 04:46:33.142
APPROACH. OF THE MENTAL HEALTH

04:46:33.209 --> 04:46:35.645
ASPECT WE ALWAYS PERSECUTE THE

04:46:35.711 --> 04:46:37.513
GUN OR THE GUN OWNER. BUT WE

04:46:37.580 --> 04:46:39.382
HAVE NEVER REALLY TAKEN A

04:46:39.448 --> 04:46:41.784
CONCERTED EFFORT BY LOOKING OUT

04:46:41.851 --> 04:46:43.753
WHAT MENTAL CAPACITY WE NEED TO

04:46:43.819 --> 04:46:46.155
APPROACH OF BEING ABLE TO BE

04:46:46.222 --> 04:46:48.524
EFFECTIVE ON THIS FIGHT.

04:46:48.591 --> 04:46:51.861
AGAINST GUN VIOLENCE. IT'S

04:46:51.928 --> 04:46:53.062
ABSURD THAT WE KEEP THROWING

04:46:53.129 --> 04:46:55.531
MONEY AT THINGS AND WE GET VERY

04:46:55.598 --> 04:46:56.566
MINIMAL RESULTS AND I'M NOT

04:46:56.632 --> 04:46:58.401
TRYING TO SAY THAT THE PROGRAMS

04:46:58.467 --> 04:47:00.269
THAT YOU HAVE DEMONSTRATORS ARE

04:47:00.336 --> 04:47:02.305
MINIMAL RESULTS. WHAT I'M

04:47:02.371 --> 04:47:03.906
SAYING IS WHEN WE LOOK AT THE

04:47:03.973 --> 04:47:07.209
WAR ON DRUGS. IT'S A VISIBLE

04:47:07.276 --> 04:47:08.110
ONLY LOOK AT THE WAR ON

04:47:08.177 --> 04:47:10.112
ANYTHING. WE JUST THROW MONEY

04:47:10.179 --> 04:47:11.414
AT IT AND NEVER HAVE A METRIC

04:47:11.480 --> 04:47:13.382
PLAN TO ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING

04:47:13.449 --> 04:47:15.585
WITH. ANTICIPATED EXPECTED

04:47:15.651 --> 04:47:21.157
OUTCOMES. WHAT I'M HOPING FOR.

04:47:21.223 --> 04:47:24.126
IS THE AUTHOR. IS IT THAT IT'S

04:47:24.193 --> 04:47:27.897
MOVES OUT TODAY WILL COMMIT. TO

04:47:27.964 --> 04:47:29.832
WORKING WITH THE MENTAL HEALTH

04:47:29.899 --> 04:47:32.134
BEHAVIORAL COMPONENT IN THE

04:47:32.201 --> 04:47:34.704
BUDGET AND THE DEPARTMENTS AND

04:47:34.770 --> 04:47:37.239
THE PROFESSIONALS TO SEEK OUT A

04:47:37.306 --> 04:47:41.477
SOLUTION. TO BE ABLE TO WORK

04:47:41.544 --> 04:47:46.382
TOWARDS AN ABSOLUTE. PLAN THAT

04:47:46.449 --> 04:47:48.250
IS SCRIPTED AND PRESCRIPTIVE

04:47:48.317 --> 04:47:49.952
AND WITH ANTICIPATED OUTCOMES A

04:47:50.019 --> 04:47:55.658
BRINGS US A VALUE. UNBELIEVABLY

04:47:55.725 --> 04:47:57.994
AGAIN AS I'VE SAID BEFORE THE

04:47:58.060 --> 04:47:59.395
PEOPLE THAT USE GUNS

04:47:59.462 --> 04:48:02.798
RECREATIONALLY. ARE NOT A

04:48:02.865 --> 04:48:03.833
PROBLEM IT'S THE PEOPLE THAT

04:48:03.899 --> 04:48:06.736
HAVE MENTAL HEALTH- ANGER

04:48:06.802 --> 04:48:10.806
ISSUES OKAY. I USED TO FEED MY

04:48:10.873 --> 04:48:13.976
FAMILY I HUNTING. I CAN'T

04:48:14.043 --> 04:48:17.680
ANYMORE. BECAUSE I WORK HERE

04:48:17.747 --> 04:48:21.784
AND WE'RE ALWAYS HERE. BUT I

04:48:21.851 --> 04:48:24.687
WOULD LIKE TO AGAIN SUNDAY. I

04:48:24.754 --> 04:48:26.155
WANNA MAKE SURE THAT ALSO THE

04:48:26.222 --> 04:48:32.028
AUTHOR. COMMITS. TO SOME KIND

04:48:32.094 --> 04:48:33.796
OF TRACKING METHODOLOGY

04:48:33.863 --> 04:48:37.767
STATEWIDE. THAT IF IT IS NOT

04:48:37.833 --> 04:48:40.269
EFFECTIVE. THAT IT IS A PILOT

04:48:40.336 --> 04:48:43.539
PROGRAM. AND IT DOES REVERT

04:48:43.606 --> 04:48:45.041
BACK BECAUSE THESE THINGS IN

04:48:45.107 --> 04:48:48.411
PERPETUITY. THEY HAVE A LIFE OF

04:48:48.477 --> 04:48:50.346
THEIR OWN AND IF WE DON'T SAY

04:48:50.413 --> 04:48:51.747
THAT IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WE

04:48:51.814 --> 04:48:52.682
NEED TO DO SOMETHING

04:48:52.748 --> 04:48:54.750
DIFFERENTLY IT'LL CONTINUE JUST

04:48:54.817 --> 04:48:58.087
TO OF ALL. INTO SOMETHING ELSE.

04:48:58.154 --> 04:49:00.523
SO I'M LOOKING FORWARD. AND

04:49:00.589 --> 04:49:03.059
RESERVE THE RIGHT TO RESERVE

04:49:03.125 --> 04:49:05.227
THIS BILL DOES NOT CHANGE TO

04:49:05.294 --> 04:49:07.730
WHAT I'M ASKING FOR. IN THE

04:49:07.797 --> 04:49:10.833
SENATE. AND WHEN IT COMES BACK

04:49:10.900 --> 04:49:13.569
HERE FOR CONCURRENCE I WILL.

04:49:13.636 --> 04:49:17.006
CHANGE MY VOTE. I HAVE NEVER

04:49:17.073 --> 04:49:19.942
VOTED ON A GUN BILL IN THIS

04:49:20.009 --> 04:49:22.211
HOUSE AS A DEMOCRAT. BECAUSE

04:49:22.278 --> 04:49:24.380
I'VE FOUGHT AT ALL TIMES WE

04:49:24.447 --> 04:49:27.216
HAVE DONE THIS ABSOLUTELY WRONG

04:49:27.283 --> 04:49:30.119
THIS MAY BE THE CHANCE. THIS

04:49:30.186 --> 04:49:32.421
VERY WELL MAY BE THE CHANCE.

04:49:32.488 --> 04:49:34.323
AND IF WE CAN GET THAT MENTAL

04:49:34.390 --> 04:49:35.091
HEALTH COMPONENT AND PLANNED

04:49:35.157 --> 04:49:37.927

PUBLISHED ONLINE. BY GUN RIGHTS

04:51:19.962 --> 04:51:22.631
ADVOCATES SAYING THAT DATE THAT

BILL MODELED AFTER A FEDERAL

04:51:56.065 --> 04:51:57.900
PROGRAM THAT EVEN MITCH

04:51:57.967 --> 04:52:00.035

A PATH IN SOCIETY WHERE THEY'RE

04:52:23.325 --> 04:52:25.227
NOT CAUSING HARM WERE THAT THEY

04:52:26.929 --> 04:52:29.198

OF THE CARBON CAPTURE

05:01:37.846 --> 05:01:39.481
TECHNOLOGY BECAUSE I KNOW THAT

05:01:39.548 --> 05:01:40.415

FIGURE OUT HOW TO SUCK UP ALL

05:01:58.900 --> 05:02:00.902
THE CARBON IN OUR ATMOSPHERE.

05:02:00.969 --> 05:02:04.105
TO SAVE THE PLANET MORE POWER

05:02:04.172 --> 05:02:05.640
TO THEM THERE IS ABSOLUTELY

05:02:05.707 --> 05:02:07.108
NOTHING IN THIS BILL THAT

05:02:07.175 --> 05:02:09.077

05:02:09.144 --> 05:02:13.515

NARRATIVES OUT THERE IN THAT

05:02:59.361 --> 05:03:00.662
SENSE OF URGENCY IS THAT THE

REALITIES THAT CLIMATE CHANGE

05:03:01.830 --> 05:03:03.765

THAT I LIVE AND IT'S NOT THAT

05:03:15.944 --> 05:03:17.479
IT GETS SO HOT IT'S NOT THAT I

DON'T HAVE A CONDITIONER AND

05:03:18.413 --> 05:03:20.048
THOSE THINGS ARE TRUE. IT'S

05:03:20.115 --> 05:03:21.082
THAT WHEN IT GETS SO HOT THAT

05:03:21.149 --> 05:03:22.384
ALL THE TOXIC THAT I COUNTY

05:03:22.450 --> 05:03:24.019

05:03:24.085 --> 05:03:25.086
GET BAKED IN AND THEY GET

WE'RE DYING SOONER OUT THERE.

05:03:27.923 --> 05:03:29.124
IS IT WHEN YOU TAKE ACTION NOW

05:03:29.190 --> 05:03:30.091
AND THIS BILL IS ABOUT BEING

05:03:30.158 --> 05:03:31.960
SENSIBLE IT'S ABOUT SAYING THAT

05:03:32.027 --> 05:03:32.994
FIRST WE NEED TO HAVE EMISSION

05:03:33.061 --> 05:03:34.629
REDUCTIONS BEFORE WE MOVE INTO

05:03:34.696 --> 05:03:35.931
THE CITY INTO THE SPACE.

05:03:35.997 --> 05:03:36.932
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK

05:03:36.998 --> 05:03:39.501
ABOUT 90% REDUCTIONS THAT'S NOT

05:03:39.568 --> 05:03:41.036
A RANDOM NUMBER IT'S WHAT THE

05:03:41.102 --> 05:03:43.171
STUDY THAT HAS BEEN- CONDUCTED

05:03:43.238 --> 05:03:45.373
HERE BUT IT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING

05:03:45.440 --> 05:03:47.242
AROUND THE WORLD ALREADY. OUT

05:03:47.309 --> 05:03:49.711
THERE AND SO IT'S NOT JUST

05:03:49.778 --> 05:03:52.180
ABOUT THE CARBON NEUTRALLY THE

05:03:52.247 --> 05:03:53.515
REALITIES THAT WE NEED NEGATIVE

05:03:53.582 --> 05:03:54.983
EMISSIONS MEANING THAT WE NEED

05:03:55.050 --> 05:03:56.818
TO NOT JUST REDUCE OR ELIMINATE

05:03:56.885 --> 05:03:57.852
THE CARBON WE'RE PUTTING OUT

05:03:57.919 --> 05:03:59.521
TODAY BUT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH

05:03:59.588 --> 05:04:00.689
ALL THE CARBON THAT'S ALREADY

05:04:00.755 --> 05:04:01.323
OUT THERE THAT GOT US TO THIS

05:04:01.389 --> 05:04:02.958
POINT ALREADY. SO THAT THEY CAN

05:04:03.024 --> 05:04:04.159
OLOGY IS NEEDED WE'RE

05:04:04.225 --> 05:04:05.360
DEFINITELY NOT DEFINITELY IN

05:04:05.427 --> 05:04:06.962
THAT IT'S GOING TO BE NEEDED TO

05:04:07.028 --> 05:04:07.929
MAKE SURE WE ADDRESS THOSE

05:04:07.996 --> 05:04:09.464
ISSUES OUT THERE WE ARE

05:04:09.531 --> 05:04:10.665
CURRENTLY BEING TOLD THAT WE

05:04:10.732 --> 05:04:11.433
HAVE TO PICK THESE FALSE

05:04:11.499 --> 05:04:13.101
NARRATIVES. BETWEEN ONE AND THE

05:04:13.168 --> 05:04:14.869
OTHER AND THE REALITY IS THAT

05:04:14.936 --> 05:04:16.104
THIS IS THE FIFTH BIGGEST CASE

05:04:16.171 --> 05:04:17.639
STATE BECAUSE WE'RE INNOVATIVE

05:04:17.706 --> 05:04:19.274
BECAUSE WE MOVE FORWARD AND WE

05:04:19.341 --> 05:04:20.909
CAN FIGURE THIS OUT AND I HAVE

05:04:20.976 --> 05:04:26.448
THAT FAITH. AND SO. I

05:04:26.514 --> 05:04:27.015

MEASURE WOULD CODIFY A CARBON

05:04:44.599 --> 05:04:46.534
NEUTRALITY GOAL FOR TWENTY

05:04:46.601 --> 05:04:47.736

DEGRADATION AND SEA LEVEL RISE

05:04:53.742 --> 05:04:55.143
WEATHER EXTREMES SUCH AS HE

05:04:55.210 --> 05:04:57.746
DROUGHT FOOD- AND WATER AND

I'VE BEEN TRYING FOR WEEKS TO

05:05:22.070 --> 05:05:24.205
UNDERSTAND THIS BILL BECAUSE WE

05:05:24.272 --> 05:05:26.341
GET ONE STORY FROM ONE GROUP

05:05:26.408 --> 05:05:28.677
AND ONE FROM ANOTHER. AND I WAS

05:05:28.743 --> 05:05:30.445
SITTING DOWN WITH THE MEMBER

05:05:30.512 --> 05:05:32.414
FROM RANCHO CORDOVA. THIS

05:05:32.480 --> 05:05:34.816
MORNING AND WE WERE LOOKING AT

05:05:34.883 --> 05:05:36.718
IT AND TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT.

05:05:36.785 --> 05:05:38.420
AND I WENT TO THE MEMBER FROM

05:05:38.486 --> 05:05:40.689
TORRANCE AND I SAID LOOK. THIS

05:05:40.755 --> 05:05:45.193
SECTION AND IT'S FREE. SECTION

05:05:45.260 --> 05:05:47.462
THREE IN ITS ON PAGE THREE OF

05:05:47.529 --> 05:05:49.864
PRIORITIZE THE USE OF NATURE

05:05:49.931 --> 05:05:52.634
BASED SOLUTIONS IN CALIFORNIA

05:05:52.701 --> 05:05:54.803
TO ACHIEVE CARBON NEUTRALITY.

05:05:54.869 --> 05:05:57.872
AND THE DIFFICULTY WAS WITH ME

05:05:57.939 --> 05:05:59.974
BUT NOW IT'S NOW IT'S NOW IT'S

05:06:00.041 --> 05:06:01.976
GOING TO WORK ON IT IS IT'S

05:06:02.043 --> 05:06:03.278
HARD TO INTERPRET WHAT

05:06:03.344 --> 05:06:05.947
PRIORITIZE MEANS SO I'VE ASKED

05:06:06.014 --> 05:06:07.182
HIM TO LOOK AT DIFFERENT

05:06:07.248 --> 05:06:09.284
LANGUAGE HE'S GOING TO DO THAT.

05:06:11.186 --> 05:06:12.754
VOTE FOR THIS BECAUSE FRANKLY

05:06:12.821 --> 05:06:14.756
ONE OF THE REASONS I CAME HERE

05:06:14.823 --> 05:06:16.925
WAS TO WORK ON THIS ONE IS TO

05:06:16.991 --> 05:06:18.526
HAVE THESE GOALS AND YOU

05:06:18.593 --> 05:06:20.462

05:06:29.804 --> 05:06:32.140
A CHANCE. YEAH THANK YOU

05:06:32.207 --> 05:06:35.510
MEMBERS- AND MISTER SPEAKER-

05:06:35.577 --> 05:06:36.644
FIRST OF ALL I I'M GLAD THAT

05:06:36.711 --> 05:06:38.012
WE'RE HAVING THIS DEBATE IN

05:06:38.079 --> 05:06:40.115
THIS DISCUSSION ON THIS FLOOR.

05:06:40.181 --> 05:06:41.416
ABOUT WHAT POLICY SHOULD BE

05:06:41.483 --> 05:06:44.452
ABOUT WHAT- BENCHMARKS WE

05:06:44.519 --> 05:06:45.954
SHOULD BE SETTING BECAUSE

05:06:46.020 --> 05:06:48.156
LATELY THE GOVERNOR'S BEEN THE

05:06:48.223 --> 05:06:49.057
ONE MAKING THAT DECISION

05:06:49.124 --> 05:06:53.895
HIMSELF. INSTEAD OF THIS BODY.

05:06:53.962 --> 05:06:54.996
I JUST WANT TO BEGIN WITH THE

05:06:55.063 --> 05:06:57.298
FACT THAT WE SHOULD BE THE ONES

05:06:57.365 --> 05:06:59.667
ESTABLISHING WHAT THE POLICY IS.

05:06:59.734 --> 05:07:03.004
AND WHAT THE TARGETS ARE. AB

05:07:03.071 --> 05:07:05.306
THIRTY TWO WAS LEGISLATION. IT

05:07:05.373 --> 05:07:07.509
STARTED IN THIS HOUSE BUT

05:07:07.575 --> 05:07:09.844
LATELY WE'VE BEEN ALLOWING THE

05:07:09.911 --> 05:07:11.579
GOVERNOR TO MAKE THOSE

05:07:11.646 --> 05:07:13.948
DECISIONS FOR US THAT'S WRONG.

05:07:14.015 --> 05:07:15.817
IN THIS BODY SHOULD HAVE LONG

05:07:15.884 --> 05:07:16.785
SINCE BEEN PUSHING BACK AGAINST

05:07:16.851 --> 05:07:19.287
THAT. AND SAY NO GOVERNOR YOU

05:07:19.354 --> 05:07:22.924
DON'T GET TO LEGISLATE. IT'S

05:07:22.991 --> 05:07:23.591
BEEN ONE OF MY GREATEST

05:07:23.658 --> 05:07:25.760
FRUSTRATIONS AND I JUST WANT TO

05:07:25.827 --> 05:07:28.129
START BY SAYING I JUST REALLY

05:07:28.196 --> 05:07:30.198
EMPLOYER THIS BODY PLEASE.

05:07:30.265 --> 05:07:33.935
PLEASE PUSH BACK. STOP LETTING

05:07:34.002 --> 05:07:35.436
THIS GOVERNOR BE THE ONE THAT

05:07:35.503 --> 05:07:36.304
MAKES THESE DECISIONS FOR THE

05:07:36.371 --> 05:07:37.806
WHOLE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ABOUT

05:07:37.872 --> 05:07:40.341
WHEN ELECTRIC CARS YOU KNOW

05:07:40.408 --> 05:07:40.909
WILL NO LONGER BE ABLE TO BE

05:07:40.975 --> 05:07:45.446
SOLD. WHEN AG EQUIPMENT. WILL

05:07:45.513 --> 05:07:47.448
HAVE TO BE TOTALLY ZERO

05:07:47.515 --> 05:07:50.485
EMISSION WHICH IS RIGHT BY THE

05:07:50.552 --> 05:07:52.287
WAY RIGHT NOW NOT EVEN POSSIBLE

05:07:52.353 --> 05:07:55.256
IMPOSSIBLE. TO HAVE THE AG

05:07:55.323 --> 05:07:56.791
EQUIPMENT THAT MAKES YOUR THAT

05:07:56.858 --> 05:07:59.294
BRINGS FOOD TO YOUR TABLE. AND

05:07:59.360 --> 05:08:04.399
AROUND THE WORLD. IS BANNED BY

05:08:04.465 --> 05:08:06.835
THIS BY A GOVERNOR BY AN EDICT.

05:08:06.901 --> 05:08:08.670
SO I'M GLAD WE'RE HAD AT LEAST

05:08:08.736 --> 05:08:09.571
HAVING THIS DISCUSSION THE

05:08:09.637 --> 05:08:11.472
LEGISLATURE WERE ELECTED

05:08:11.539 --> 05:08:13.308
MEMBERS OF THE ENTIRE STATE.

05:08:13.374 --> 05:08:16.744
CAN HELP DETERMINE THIS. BUT A

05:08:16.811 --> 05:08:19.347
FORTUNE I THINK THIS THIS BILL

05:08:19.414 --> 05:08:21.082
FOR IN PARTICULAR IS WRONG SIDE

05:08:21.149 --> 05:08:23.885
AND HERE'S WHY. I THINK CARBON

05:08:23.952 --> 05:08:25.553
NEUTRALITY IS A GREAT GOAL FOR

05:08:25.620 --> 05:08:29.257
US TO BE A- BUT LIKE WITH. MANY

05:08:29.324 --> 05:08:30.758
THINGS WHERE WE'VE GONE WRONG

05:08:30.825 --> 05:08:32.961
WE HAVEN'T ALLOWED THE MARKET.

05:08:33.027 --> 05:08:34.996
AND WE HAVEN'T ALLOWED THE FULL

05:08:35.063 --> 05:08:35.597
AMOUNT OF INNOVATION TO GET US

05:08:35.663 --> 05:08:38.166
THERE. YOU KNOW BY THE WAY

05:08:38.233 --> 05:08:39.767
WE'VE DONE ALL THIS IN

05:08:39.834 --> 05:08:41.803
CALIFORNIA WHERE IS CHINA.

05:08:41.870 --> 05:08:43.738
WHERE IS INDIA WHERE'S THE

05:08:43.805 --> 05:08:44.739
DEMANDS ON THESE OTHER

05:08:44.806 --> 05:08:46.407
COUNTRIES AND STATES WHO ARE

05:08:46.474 --> 05:08:48.643
MUCH GREATER CARBON EMITTER IS

05:08:48.710 --> 05:08:50.845
THAN ALL OF US. MEANWHILE ALL

05:08:50.912 --> 05:08:52.480
OF OUR CONSTITUENTS OF HAVE

05:08:52.547 --> 05:08:55.383
HAVE BORNE THE BRUNT. OF THIS

05:08:55.450 --> 05:09:00.588
IN COST. COST OF LIVING FOR

05:09:00.655 --> 05:09:03.558
ABILITY. AND WE JUST KEEP

05:09:03.625 --> 05:09:06.561
STACKING IT ON WALL WE HAVE NO

05:09:06.628 --> 05:09:08.763
EXPECTATIONS OF ANYBODYELSE TO

05:09:08.830 --> 05:09:12.066
MEET THEIR GOALS. WHERE IS THE

05:09:12.133 --> 05:09:14.235
TEETH WERE AS THE TEETH ON ON A

05:09:14.302 --> 05:09:15.637
COUNTRY LIKE CHINA WE HAVE WE

05:09:15.703 --> 05:09:17.505
DO NOT DEMAND ACCOUNTABILITY ON

05:09:17.572 --> 05:09:20.742
THEIR PART. WE DON'T DEMAND

05:09:20.808 --> 05:09:21.342
ACCOUNTABILITY ON OTHER STATES

05:09:21.409 --> 05:09:24.245
TO MEET THEIR- THEIR LEVELS

05:09:24.312 --> 05:09:24.846
MEANWHILE YOU KEEP STACKING ON

05:09:24.913 --> 05:09:29.183
US. AND THEN I WILL GET TO THE

05:09:29.250 --> 05:09:31.219
ISSUE OF CARBON SEQUESTRATION

05:09:31.286 --> 05:09:34.289
BECAUSE THERE IS. A LOT OF

05:09:34.355 --> 05:09:35.823
INNOVATION GOING ON RIGHT NOW-

05:09:35.890 --> 05:09:37.892
CARBON SEQUESTRATION TECHNOLOGY

05:09:37.959 --> 05:09:39.527
AND THIS BILL DOES NOT OF IT

05:09:39.594 --> 05:09:40.828
RESTRICTS IT. IT DOES

05:09:40.895 --> 05:09:43.898
RESTRICTED. AND WHY IS NOT A

05:09:43.965 --> 05:09:46.234
PROBLEM TWO REASONS. THAT'S

05:09:46.301 --> 05:09:47.368
BLUE COLLAR JOBS IS GOING TO

05:09:47.435 --> 05:09:49.470
COST YOU THAT'S WHY LABOR HAS

05:09:49.537 --> 05:09:52.073
BEEN AGAINST THIS BILL. BECAUSE

05:09:52.140 --> 05:09:53.675
YOU HAVE BLUE COLLAR JOBS IN

05:09:53.741 --> 05:09:56.044
OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY THE COULD

05:09:56.110 --> 05:09:57.612
BE PART OF THE CARBON

05:09:57.679 --> 05:10:00.448
NEUTRALITY SO. SOLUTION THROUGH

05:10:00.515 --> 05:10:02.784
CARBON SQUESTRATION TECHNOLOGY

05:10:02.850 --> 05:10:03.985
THAT HELPS TAKE THAT CARBON OUT

05:10:04.052 --> 05:10:05.687
OF THE AIR IT'S A QUESTION IT

05:10:05.753 --> 05:10:08.056
BACK IN THE GROUND THE NUMBER

05:10:08.122 --> 05:10:08.923
TWO AND I'LL THIS IS THE MOST

05:10:08.990 --> 05:10:10.291
IMPORTANT PART A MINUTE MOST

05:10:10.358 --> 05:10:12.393
IMPORTANT POINT I'M GONNA AND

05:10:12.460 --> 05:10:14.662
WITH. BIOMASS RIGHT NOW IT UC

05:10:14.729 --> 05:10:17.265
BERKELEY RESEARCHERS ARE

05:10:17.332 --> 05:10:20.101
FINDING WAYS TO TAKE BIOMASS

05:10:20.168 --> 05:10:21.636
TECHNOLOGY AND SEQUESTER

05:10:21.703 --> 05:10:23.571
COMPLETELY IN THE GROUND AND WE

05:10:23.638 --> 05:10:26.207
HAVE A WILD FIRE PROBLEM. WE

05:10:26.274 --> 05:10:27.742
HAVE A CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRE

05:10:27.809 --> 05:10:29.310
PROBLEM THROUGHOUT THE STATE.

05:10:29.377 --> 05:10:30.611
WE SHOULD BE WORKING WITH THOSE

05:10:30.678 --> 05:10:32.347
RESEARCHERS TO HAVE A BIOMASS

05:10:32.413 --> 05:10:35.583
PLANT ALL AROUND THE FOOTHILLS.

05:10:35.650 --> 05:10:37.418
OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO

05:10:37.485 --> 05:10:38.086
TAKE THESE FUELS OUT OF THE

05:10:38.152 --> 05:10:40.121
FOREST. BURN THEM AND THEN

05:10:40.188 --> 05:10:42.924
SEQUESTER THEM. IN THE GROUND

05:10:42.991 --> 05:10:45.159
THE TECHNOLOGY IS THERE WE JUST

05:10:45.226 --> 05:10:47.762
HAVE TO HAVE THE WILL TO DO IT.

05:10:47.829 --> 05:10:48.329
AND WE SHOULDN'T BLOCK THAT

05:10:48.396 --> 05:10:51.699
INNOVATION. AND THAT'S WHY I

05:10:51.766 --> 05:10:52.266
BELIEVE WE SHOULD VOTE THIS

05:10:52.333 --> 05:10:54.202
BILL DOWN TODAY. WE THINK WE

05:10:54.268 --> 05:10:55.603
CAN DO BETTER WE CAN HAVE A

05:10:55.670 --> 05:10:57.872
BETTER POLICY AND IT SHOULD BE

05:10:57.939 --> 05:11:00.341
CREATED BY ALL OF US. BY INPUT

05:11:00.408 --> 05:11:02.577
FROM ALL OF US. IN ALL THE

05:11:02.643 --> 05:11:04.579
CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE AFFECTED

05:11:04.645 --> 05:11:05.213
BY THIS AND YOU PAY THE COST OF

05:11:05.279 --> 05:11:11.953
THIS. AND NO LONGER BY ONE MAN.

05:11:12.020 --> 05:11:16.691
THANK YOU MEMBERS. MR COOLEY

05:11:16.758 --> 05:11:21.229
YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. COLLEAGUES

05:11:21.295 --> 05:11:22.730
I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL.

05:11:22.797 --> 05:11:26.534
HI I HAD A REAL PROBLEM WITH

05:11:26.601 --> 05:11:28.636
THIS BILL REALLY BEFORE THE

05:11:28.703 --> 05:11:32.073
AMENDMENTS IN MAY. I SAW IT IS

05:11:32.140 --> 05:11:35.043
INDEED RESTRICTING. TECHNOLOGY

05:11:35.109 --> 05:11:40.014
BASED CARBON SEQUESTRATION 210%

05:11:40.081 --> 05:11:41.416
AND MADE ME ASK MYSELF WHY

05:11:41.482 --> 05:11:43.351
WOULD ARE WE BECOMING LUDDITES

05:11:43.418 --> 05:11:45.353
AND CALIFORNIA ANTI TECHNOLOGY

05:11:45.420 --> 05:11:47.622
THE HOME OF TECHNOLOGY SO

05:11:47.688 --> 05:11:50.291
PRODUCTIVE AN ECONOMY BUT THAT

05:11:50.358 --> 05:11:51.993
THAT ACTUALLY LIMITATION CAME

05:11:52.060 --> 05:11:54.896
OUT IN MAY. SO THAT BRINGS ME

05:11:54.962 --> 05:11:56.998
BACK TO THE BILL AND SHE- AND

05:11:57.065 --> 05:12:00.635
IT SAYS THAT WE'RE GOING TO-

05:12:00.701 --> 05:12:03.538
SET THIS BIG STRETCH GOAL OF

05:12:03.604 --> 05:12:06.707
REDUCING CARBON REMOVING IT

05:12:06.774 --> 05:12:09.577
FROM THE ATMOSPHERE. THAT IT IT

05:12:09.644 --> 05:12:12.547
DOES INDEED PRIORITIZE NATURAL

05:12:12.613 --> 05:12:15.817
MEANS OF DOING THAT. BUT IT

05:12:15.883 --> 05:12:18.586
DOES NOT CRAM DOWN AND LIMIT OF

05:12:18.653 --> 05:12:19.987
EFFORTS TO REMOVE CARBON FROM

05:12:20.054 --> 05:12:22.023
SORT OF THE PIPELINE BEFORE TEN

05:12:22.090 --> 05:12:25.693
THE ATMOSPHERE FOR EXAMPLE 210%

05:12:25.760 --> 05:12:27.995
AND IT IS IMPORTANT TO ME

05:12:28.062 --> 05:12:30.832
ACTUALLY THAT EXISTING LAW.

05:12:30.898 --> 05:12:32.733
I'VE GOT IT HERE ON MY DESK

05:12:32.800 --> 05:12:35.169
HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE SECTION

05:12:35.236 --> 05:12:36.471
THREE EIGHT FIVE SIX ONE.

05:12:36.537 --> 05:12:38.139
ALREADY PERMITS UNDER THE MAKE

05:12:38.206 --> 05:12:39.740
ALL THE UNDER THE ALL IMPORTANT

05:12:39.807 --> 05:12:41.976
SCOPING PLAN THAT AIR BE

05:12:42.043 --> 05:12:48.950
ADMINISTERS RECOGNITION OF.

05:12:49.016 --> 05:12:50.985
COURTESY QUESTION PROJECTS AND

05:12:51.052 --> 05:12:53.421
BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES SO

05:12:53.488 --> 05:12:55.590
ALREADY THE LAW ALLOWS AND

05:12:55.656 --> 05:12:57.425
RECOGNIZES THAT THESE SORTS OF

05:12:57.492 --> 05:12:59.060
CARBON SEQUESTRATION PROJECTS

05:12:59.127 --> 05:13:01.295
FIT WITHIN THE AIR BE SCOPING

05:13:01.362 --> 05:13:04.031
PLAN THIS BILL WILL ALLOW IT TO

05:13:04.098 --> 05:13:07.869
CONTINUE- I THINK WE DEFINITELY

05:13:07.935 --> 05:13:10.238
WANT TO KEEP AN EYE ON HOW THE

05:13:10.304 --> 05:13:11.105
A. R. B. ADMINISTERS THESE

05:13:11.172 --> 05:13:13.641
PROVISIONS. BUT I SEE IT AS A

05:13:13.708 --> 05:13:16.277
STRETCH GOAL. WITH AN EMPHASIS

05:13:16.344 --> 05:13:19.080
UPON NATURAL SYSTEMS FOUR

05:13:19.147 --> 05:13:21.315
REMOVED FROM THE ATMOSPHERE BUT

05:13:21.382 --> 05:13:23.317
ALSO CARBON SEQUESTRATION

05:13:23.384 --> 05:13:24.852
SERVER OPERATIVE PLANTED YOU

05:13:24.919 --> 05:13:25.887
CAN DEVELOP TECHNOLOGY TO

05:13:25.953 --> 05:13:27.321
REDUCE THE FROM BORN IN THE

05:13:27.388 --> 05:13:29.357
ATMOSPHERE I DO THINK THAT.

05:13:29.423 --> 05:13:30.625
THERE'S A BASIS FOR RECOGNIZE

05:13:30.691 --> 05:13:32.994
THAT IN THIS BILL AND UNDER

05:13:33.060 --> 05:13:34.662
EXISTING LAW AND I THINK THAT'S

05:13:34.729 --> 05:13:36.230
ACTUALLY VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE

05:13:36.297 --> 05:13:37.865
THAT'S A PLACE WHERE INNOVATORS

05:13:37.932 --> 05:13:39.667
CAN FOCUS ON SPECIFIC

05:13:39.734 --> 05:13:41.602
INDUSTRIAL PROJECTS THE

05:13:41.669 --> 05:13:43.804
REVERSAL PROCESS SEES AND LOOK

05:13:43.871 --> 05:13:45.273
AT HOW THEY DISTRICT CARVED OUT

05:13:45.339 --> 05:13:48.309
AT THAT STAGE BEFORE. GOES IN

05:13:48.376 --> 05:13:49.477
THE ATMOSPHERE. I THINK THAT

05:13:49.544 --> 05:13:52.079
ACTUALLY FITS WITH. A PROBLEM

05:13:52.146 --> 05:13:53.814
OF THIS MAGNITUDE WE NEED EVERY

05:13:53.881 --> 05:13:56.150
ARROW IN OUR QUIVER. AND I

05:13:56.217 --> 05:13:57.084
THINK PULL IT OUT OF THE AIR IS

05:13:57.151 --> 05:13:59.387
GOOD BUT I THINK PULLING IT OUT

05:13:59.453 --> 05:14:01.489
OF. THE PIPELINE BEFORE GOES

05:14:01.556 --> 05:14:03.257
OUT THE SMOKESTACK IS ALSO GOOD

05:14:03.324 --> 05:14:05.193
I THINK THAT'S A PLACE WHERE

05:14:05.259 --> 05:14:05.760
TECHNOLOGY CAN PLAY A VERY

05:14:05.826 --> 05:14:10.765
IMPORTANT ROLE. AND SO I'M

05:14:10.831 --> 05:14:12.934
URGEN AYE VOTE ON THIS MEASURE.

05:14:13.000 --> 05:14:16.204

BECOMING A CLIMATE A CLIMATE

05:14:42.163 --> 05:14:43.764
SKEPTIC AS BECOMING SOMEBODY

05:14:43.831 --> 05:14:45.933
WHO IS A FIRM BELIEVER. THAT WE

05:14:46.000 --> 05:14:48.236
HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY I TO BE

05:14:48.302 --> 05:14:50.238
ABLE TO DEAL WITH REDUCING OUR

05:14:50.304 --> 05:14:51.405
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS TALK

05:14:51.472 --> 05:14:51.973
ABOUT THOSE NEGATIVE

05:14:52.039 --> 05:14:54.108

05:15:07.888 --> 05:15:09.690
BECAUSE IT DOES PICK WINNERS

05:15:31.779 --> 05:15:33.748
NOW BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE- I

05:15:33.814 --> 05:15:35.483
KNOW WE'VE HAD SOME DISCUSSIONS

05:15:35.549 --> 05:15:37.918

RESPONSIBILITY AND THIS IS ONE

05:15:46.560 --> 05:15:48.429
OF THESE THE THESE ISSUES THAT

05:15:48.496 --> 05:15:50.598
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SHOULD

05:15:50.665 --> 05:15:51.699
DO BECAUSE IT'S OUR

05:15:51.766 --> 05:15:53.367
RESPONSIBILITY TO REDUCE OUR

05:15:53.434 --> 05:15:54.735
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. AND

05:15:54.802 --> 05:15:56.137
WE DON'T NEED TO WAIT FOR CHINA

05:15:56.203 --> 05:15:57.538

CRIMINAL STREET GANG THE

06:19:15.766 --> 06:19:17.134
REQUIRES THAT GANG CHARGES BE

PROCEEDINGS TO AVOID BIAS. WELL

06:19:20.137 --> 06:19:21.538
MANY CRIMINAL JUSTICE EXPERTS

06:19:21.605 --> 06:19:22.372
DO BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD DO

06:19:22.439 --> 06:19:23.707
AWAY WITH GETTING HOUSES

06:19:23.774 --> 06:19:26.276
COMPLETELY THIS IS NOT WHAT A.

06:19:26.343 --> 06:19:28.779
B. THREE THREE THREE DOES- AB

06:19:28.846 --> 06:19:29.680

06:19:35.652 --> 06:19:40.057
TO. THAT AND SO I JUST WANT TO

06:19:40.124 --> 06:19:41.225
MAKE IT VERY CLEAR THAT. ONLY

06:19:41.291 --> 06:19:42.926
ABOUT FEAR LOOK LOOK WE HAVE

ISSUE OF MASS INCARCERATION. IN

06:19:47.731 --> 06:19:50.801
OUR STATE BASED MOSTLY ON FEAR

06:19:50.868 --> 06:19:52.936
AND FEAR BASED ARGUMENTS NOT

06:19:53.003 --> 06:19:55.706
FACT BASED ARGUMENTS THIS STILL

06:19:55.772 --> 06:19:57.508
ALLOWS US TO GO OUT TO THOSE

06:19:57.574 --> 06:20:00.644
THAT ARE ACTUALLY COMMITTING.

06:20:00.711 --> 06:20:01.612
CONDUCT THAT FALLS IN THE

06:20:01.678 --> 06:20:03.680
CATEGORY OF GANG CONDUCT THAT

06:20:03.747 --> 06:20:05.782

06:20:05.849 --> 06:20:07.050
NOT JUST THROWING ABROAD NOT

06:20:07.117 --> 06:20:09.987
OVER ENTIRE COMMUNITY. BASED

06:20:10.053 --> 06:20:11.722

BECAUSE THEIR PEOPLE. AND THEIR

PEOPLE WHO DONE YOU'VE MADE

06:26:07.043 --> 06:26:08.044
MISTAKES HAVE DONE HORRIBLE

06:26:08.111 --> 06:26:11.281
THINGS AT TIMES. BUT THERE

06:26:11.348 --> 06:26:13.049
PEOPLE IN THE FUNDS. NATURE OF

06:26:13.116 --> 06:26:14.684
OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND

06:26:14.751 --> 06:26:15.619
I WANT TO BE CLEAR USE JUSTICE

06:26:15.685 --> 06:26:18.088
LOOSELY THERE THEY DON'T

06:26:18.154 --> 06:26:18.722
BELIEVE THERE'S MUCH JUSTICE IN

06:26:18.788 --> 06:26:20.724
OUR SYSTEM RIGHT NOW. IS THAT

06:26:20.790 --> 06:26:22.392
WE DO NOT TAKE SOMEONE'S

06:26:22.459 --> 06:26:24.127
FREEDOM AWAY FROM THEM. AND

06:26:24.194 --> 06:26:26.897
LESS. THE PROSECUTOR HAS

06:26:26.963 --> 06:26:29.266
PROVEN. BEYOND A REASONABLE

06:26:29.332 --> 06:26:31.635
DOUBT. THAT THAT PERSON

06:26:31.701 --> 06:26:34.037
COMMITTED THE CRIME. WE DEMAND

06:26:34.104 --> 06:26:36.740
UNANIMITY IN A JURY WE DEMAND

06:26:36.806 --> 06:26:38.842
THAT THE- PROSECUTOR DO HIS OR

06:26:38.909 --> 06:26:41.077
HER JOB. BEFORE WE TAKE

06:26:41.144 --> 06:26:42.946
SOMEONE'S FREEDOM. BEFORE WE

06:26:43.013 --> 06:26:44.014
TAKE THEM AWAY FROM THEIR

06:26:44.080 --> 06:26:45.982
FAMILY AND THEIR JOB AND THEIR

06:26:46.049 --> 06:26:48.552
LIFE. BECAUSE YES. THEY'RE

06:26:48.618 --> 06:26:49.386
CALLING FROM SACRAMENTO SAID

06:26:49.452 --> 06:26:51.988
VICTIMS DESERVE. JUSTICE

06:26:52.055 --> 06:26:53.189
ANOTHER COLLEAGUE SAN DIEGO

06:26:53.256 --> 06:26:54.524
SAID THE UNDERLYING CRIME HERE

06:26:54.591 --> 06:26:56.026
WILL BE SERVED IN EFFECT IN

06:26:56.092 --> 06:26:57.794
MANY CASES THERE MIGHT BE A GUN

06:26:57.861 --> 06:26:59.329
ENHANCEMENT AS WELL BECAUSE IT

06:26:59.396 --> 06:27:01.164
DOESN'T TAKE ABOUT A HALF AN

06:27:01.231 --> 06:27:02.732
AWAY. BUT WE SHOULD NOT BE

06:27:02.799 --> 06:27:05.468
TAKING YEARS. WILL BE CLEAR

06:27:05.535 --> 06:27:07.837
YEARS AWAY FROM INDIVIDUALS AND

06:27:07.904 --> 06:27:09.506
LESS THE PROSECUTOR HAS DONE

06:27:09.573 --> 06:27:11.908
JOB THAT IS THE FUNDAMENTAL

06:27:11.975 --> 06:27:14.711
BASIS OF OUR SYSTEM AND ALL

06:27:14.778 --> 06:27:15.645
THAT THIS BILL ASKS FOR

06:27:15.712 --> 06:27:18.348
PROSECUTORS TO DO IS DO THEIR

06:27:18.415 --> 06:27:21.484
JOB AND IF THEY DO IT. IN THE

06:27:21.551 --> 06:27:22.586
GARDEN HAS BEEN WILL BE PLACED

06:27:22.652 --> 06:27:25.088
IN THE INDIVIDUAL SERVER

06:27:25.155 --> 06:27:26.056
DIFFERENT ADDITIONAL TIME. BUT

06:27:26.122 --> 06:27:27.457
IF THEY CAN'T DO THEIR JOB WE

06:27:27.524 --> 06:27:28.458
WILL NOT DENY THEM FREEDOM FOR

06:27:28.525 --> 06:27:32.295
ADDITIONAL YEARS. SO MEMBERS I

06:27:32.362 --> 06:27:33.396
PERSONALLY DON'T THINK THAT'S

06:27:33.463 --> 06:27:34.931
TOO MUCH TO ASK I THINK THAT'S

06:27:34.998 --> 06:27:36.499
WHAT THE AMERICAN SYSTEM OF

06:27:36.566 --> 06:27:38.768
JUSTICE DEMANDS OF US. SO YES

06:27:38.835 --> 06:27:40.003
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF

06:27:40.070 --> 06:27:43.573
DISCUSSION OF FEAR. AND WHEN

06:27:43.640 --> 06:27:45.508
MORE THAN 90% OF PEOPLE WHO ARE

06:27:45.575 --> 06:27:46.643
GETTING THIS PLACE ON THE MORE

06:27:46.710 --> 06:27:48.011
PEOPLE OF COLOR WE NEED TO ASK

06:27:48.078 --> 06:27:49.045
YOURSELF IF WHAT WE'RE DOING

BEING DEPORTED TO THE COUNTRY

06:44:51.200 --> 06:44:53.636
HE LEFT AS A CHILD. AND MEMBERS

06:44:53.702 --> 06:44:56.238

ACROSS THE PACIFIC AND THAT IS

06:45:11.153 --> 06:45:12.788
THE REALITY FOR SO MANY ASIAN

OF MEDIEVAL KIND OF PUNISHMENT

06:45:20.863 --> 06:45:22.364
