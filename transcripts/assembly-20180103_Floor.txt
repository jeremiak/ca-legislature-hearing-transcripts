TWO LIVING IN SETTLED AGRARIAN COMMUNITIES. DOMESTICATING ANIMALS PLANTING CROPS. THE SOCIETIES BASED ON AGRICULTURE THE MEASURING UP TIME BECAME BECAME AN IMPORTANT CONCERN. IT WAS ESSENTIAL TO KNOW WHEN TO PLANT THEIR CROPS IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE THE OPPORTUNITY. TO HAVE A SUCCESSFUL HARVEST. BECAUSE OF THIS. CONCEPT OF HAVING A CALENDAR YEAR WAS CREATED BY HUMANITY. TO GIVE A SENSE OF ORDER TO THE PASSAGE OF TIME. THEY GOT THE WORD YEAR MEANS SEASON. SO EVERY NEW YEAR. MARKED THE BEGINNING OF A NEW CYCLE OF SEASONS. TO PLAN. CULTIVATE AND HARVEST LIFE SUSTAINING CRACKS. WE RARELY GIVE THOUGHT TO HOW OR WHY HUMANKIND BEGAN TO MARK THE PASSAGE OF TIME WITH AN ONGOING CYCLE OF BEGINNINGS AND ENDINGS. BUT ALL THE CALENDARS THAT HAVE EVER EXISTED. REFLECT HUMANITIES ATTEMPTS TO MARK THE PASSING OF TIME. TIME THAT IS INFINITE. WITH OUR WISDOM EYES OPEN WE SEE THAT EVERY MOMENT IS A NEW BEGINNING. AND EVERY MOMENT CAN MARK AN ENDING. WITH OUR WISDOM ICE OPEN. LET US ALL TRY. TO LIVE APPRECIATING EACH NEW DAY. AND EVERY OPPORTUNITY. TO BE APART OF A POSITIVE NEW BEGINNING IN THE NEW YEAR AHEAD.
