THANK YOU VERY MUCH GOOD MORNING THIS CURSED IN. THE MORNING. MY NAME IS TELLING CRISTINA THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE THE SURGEON SHOULD HAVE PASSED OUT A HAND OUT THAT'LL BE REFERENCING TODAY SO I HOPE YOU HAVE THAT IT'S ALSO AVAILABLE ONLINE -- SO AS PART OF THIS FIRST PANEL ALL BE GOING FOR THE FIRST SIX PAGES ABOUT HAND OUT IN THE REMAINING PAGES WILL GO OVER AS PART OF THE SECOND THIRD PANELS -- THIS MORNING I'LL BE SETTING THE STAGE ON THE TOPIC OF EMERGENCY RESPONSE IN REDDING S. FOCUSING MOSTLY ON FIRES ALL START OUT BY TALKING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE STATE'S DISASTER RESPONSE SYSTEM -- AND THE DIFFERENT STATE AGENCIES INVOLVED -- I WILL ALSO HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE RECENT ACTIONS LEGISLATURE'S TAKEN ON WILD FIRES -- AND SOME OF THE FUNDING THAT IS PROVIDED FOR THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN FIRES. SO HE TURNED TO PAGE ONE OF YOUR HAND OUT -- WE DISCUSSED SOME OF THE MAJOR STATE AGENCIES INVOLVED IN BEFORE I GET INTO THAT I I REALLY WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT LOCALS ARE ALSO VERY VERY IMPORTANT. IN THE STATE'S DISASTER RESPONSE SYSTEM SO THEY'RE USUALLY THE FIRST FOLKS TO GET THE CALL THE NINE ONE ONE CALL -- HE RESPONDS -- AND AND REALLY ADDRESS DISASTER SITUATIONS OF IT SOMETIMES LOCAL RESOURCES ARE EXCEEDED AND THEN THERE ARE AVARIETY OF STATE ENTITIES THAT -- PROVIDE A LOT OF ASSISTANCE TO LOCALS AND AND THEIR TIMES OF DISTRESS. SO WE HIGHLIGHT A FEW OF THE KEY STATE DEPARTMENTS INVOLVED THERE ARE A WHOLE HOST OF STATE DEPARTMENT TO HAVE DIFFERENT ROLES -- SAID THIS IS BY NO MEANS COMPREHENSIVE BUT JUST WANTED TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF A FLAVOR. AS WE START OUT WITH A DISASTER PLANNING AND COORDINATION THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES IS REALLY A CRITICAL DEPARTMENT IN THIS AREA AND YOU'LL HEAR A LITTLE BIT MORE FROM THEM LATER -- SO THEY COORDINATE AND SUPPORT DISASTER PLANNING ACTIVITIES THEY ALSO COORDINATE DISASTER RESPONSE AND RECOVERY ACTIVITIES AND ONE OF THE KEY THINGS THEY DO IS CALLED MISSION TASKING SO THEY CAN TELL OTHER DEPARTMENTS HEY WE NEED YOUR RESOURCES HERE -- PLEASE COME IN SUPPORT THE STATE PLEASE COME IN SUPPORT LOCALS -- AND THEY CAN ALSO -- A COORDINATE THE MUTUAL A COMMUNITIES PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO EACH OTHER AND THEIR TIMES OF NEED. ANOTHER REALLY CRITICAL ROLE AT THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES PLAYS IS -- RELATED TO FUNDING SO THEY SERVE AS A CONDUIT FOR A LOT OF FEDERAL FUNDING WE'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT. IN A FEW MINUTES THE STATE CAN CAN SOMETIMES GET QUITE A BIT OF FEDERAL FUNDING -- DATE MINISTER THAT THEY ALSO ADMINISTER KEEP PROGRAM CALLED THE CALIFORNIA DISASTER ASSISTANCE ACT PROGRAM -- AND THAT FUNDS -- REPAIR AND REPAIR AND REPLACEMENT OF PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE AND REIMBURSES SOME LOCAL COSTS SO. THOSE ARE SOME CRITICAL OF MORALS THAT -- YES PLACE. IN TERMS OF FIRE ANOTHER DISASTER RESPONSE THERE ARE A FEW KEY DEPARTMENTS THERE -- THEY'VE DEPARTMENT FORESTRY AND FIRE IN STATE -- DEPARTMENT INVOLVED IN FIRE RESPONSE SO THEY'RE PRIMARILY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE STATE-RESPONSIBILITY AREAS THAT'S ABOUT A THIRD OF THE STATE -- THAT THE STATE IS HER FIRST MAINLY RESPONSIBLE FOR PROTECTING A MOST OF THAT IS PRIVATE LANDS -- BUT THEY ALSO ARE JUST CRITICAL IN GENERAL WITH REGARD TO FIRES. THE CALIFORNIA MILITARY DEPARTMENT IS ALSO -- AN IMPORTANT DEPARTMENT THAT CAN BE -- HARNESS REALLY WHEN THERE'S A NEED THEY CAN BRING TO BEAR A LOT OF FEDERAL RESOURCES MILITARY TYPES OF EQUIPMENT AIRCRAFT FOR EXAMPLE BUT THEY ALSO HAVE STAFF THAT CAN SERVE A VARIETY OF ROLES IN HELPING TO RESPOND. AND RECOVER FROM DISASTERS. I'M ALSO JUST WANT TO MENTION OF WATER RESOURCES DEPARTMENT WATER RESOURCES WE DON'T THINK ABOUT THEM VERY MUCH -- SOMETIMES IN CONTACT THE FIRES BUT THEY CAN BE IMPORTANT THAT CAN PROVIDE SANDBAGS IN THOSE KINDS OF THINGS IF THERE'S GONNA BE A MUD SLIDE. BUT THEY ALSO ARE REALLY IMPORTANT IF WE IF WE GET A FLOOD EVENT AND THAT COURSE THE STATE IS NOT JUST FROM THE FIRES BUT WERE FOREIGN FRONT TO FLOODS. EARTHQUAKES AND AND OTHER TYPES OF DISASTERS AS WELL. SO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE -- TWO WE HIGHLIGHT A FEW OF THE DEPARTMENTS INVOLVED IN RECOVERY ASSISTANCE THE DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL -- THEY'RE THEY'RE KIND OF FIRST -- ON THE GROUND IN TERMS OF CLEANING UP THE DEBRIS THEY GET ALL OF THE REALLY HAZARDOUS AND TOXIC KINDS OF MATERIALS OF THEIR PROPANE TANKS ARE AS BEST AS THEY COME IN AND MAKE SURE THAT THOSE ARE COLLECTED AFTER FIRE RATHER MAJOR DISASTER -- SO THEY DON'T CONTAMINATE -- CONTAMINATE OUR BEAUTIFUL ENVIRONMENT POWER CYCLE PAYS A REALLY CRITICAL ROLE NAY THEY ACTUALLY GET THE BULK OF THE MATERIAL ASH THE CONCRETE THE METALS AND THEY CLEAN THAT UP AND WE'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT AND YOU KNOW WE'LL WE'LL ALSO HEAR FROM COVER CYCLE TODAY -- BUT THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT ROLE WITH REGARD TO FIRES IN PARTICULAR -- ALSO JUST QUICKLY TO MENTION THE DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES THEY ADMINISTER TEMPORARY SHELTERS AND THEY ALSO RUN A PROGRAM THE STATE HAD TO PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL CASH ASSISTANCE TO FOLKS -- ITS IT'S ABOUT UP TO TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS SO IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO FULLY MAKE PEOPLE WHOLE BUT IT IS IS CERTAINLY CONTRIBUTION. SO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE THREE WE SUMMARIZE SOME OF THE STATE FUNDING THAT'S PROVIDED FOR DISASTER RESPONSE AND RECOVERY. I'M JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT A FEW THINGS SO CAL FIRE HAS A FACT BASED BUDGET FOR FIRE CONTROL RELATED ACTIVITIES THAT'S USUALLY ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR -- THEY ALSO HAVE A BASE BUDGET FOR THEIR EMERGENCY FUNDS AND THAT'S USED WHEN A FIRE INCIDENT EXCEED THE FIRST TWENTY FOUR HOURS OF RESPONSE AND USUALLY THAT'S ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION. SEVEN ADDITION -- YES ALSO HAS THE CDA PROGRAM WHICH I REFERENCED -- PREVIOUSLY AND THEY HAVE A SET UP FOR THAT PROGRAM. SO IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THERE ARE SOME BUDGET MECHANISMS THAT THE STATE HAS HISTORICALLY HAD TO MAKE MJOR ADJUSTMENTS THIS IS PRETTY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE NEVER KNOW WHEN THE NEXT DISASTER GOING TO HIT AND WHAT LEVEL OF RESOURCES WE'RE GONNA NEED AND WE NEED TO MAKE BE. ABLE TO MAKE CURRENT YEAR ADJUSTMENTS -- OFTEN IF THERE IS A NEED TO ADD A NEED FOR ADDITIONAL RESOURCES SO THERE THE E. FUND HAS A PROVISION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE CAN MAKE AUGMENTATIONS -- AND THERE'S ALSO ANOTHER ACCOUNT AND I KNOW -- THIS IS ESTHER RESPONSE EMERGENCY OPERATIONS ACCOUNT THIS ACCOUNT ACTUALLY CENTS ADDED -- AS OF JANUARY FIRST OF THIS YEAR -- BUT IT'S BEEN HAVE AN IMPORTANT TOOL FOR THE STATE TO USE -- TO WHERE BY AGAIN -- THE ADMINISTRATION DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE CAN ALLOCATE FUNDS FROM ONE OF THE STATE'S RESERVE ACCOUNTS. TO PAY FOR UNANTICIPATED COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH DISASTERS. SO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE -- FOUR WOULD PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT OF INFORMATION ON FEDERAL FUNDING -- SO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PLAYS A REALLY IMPORTANT ROLE IN HELPING TO FIND DISASTER RESPONSE AND RECOVERY COSTS IN THE CASE OF A VERY MAJOR DISASTER. ON THERE ARE LOTS OF FEDERAL PROGRAMS IN THE KEY THINGS THEY FIND OUR RESPONSE -- DEBRIS REMOVAL REBUILDING PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE -- THEY ALSO HAVE A PROGRAM CALLED THE HAZARD MITIGATION GRANT PROGRAM WE'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT AS PER THE THIRD PANEL -- AND THAT FIND SOME PROJECTS THAT CAN REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD OF FUTURE DISASTERS SO THAT'S AT THE KIND OF INTERESTING AND HELPFUL PROGRAM THAT THEY HOP TO HELP US REBUILD. AND ALSO BE MORE RESILIENT AND THE FUTURE. I AM SO IN GENERAL THE STATE GETS ABOUT A 75% COST YOU'RE THAT KIND OF A RULE OF THUMB THAT THE SEVENTY THAT THE FEDS COME IN AND PAY ABOUT 75%. IT'S NOT ALWAYS 75% IT CAN BE MORE WE CAN SOME WE CAN REQUEST A HIGHER LEVEL OF REIMBURSEMENT AND WE HAVE REQUESTED A HIGHER LEVEL OF REIMBURSEMENT BOOK FOR BOTH TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN FIRES. I THINK WE REQUESTED A 100% FOR CERTAIN CATEGORIES IN FOR I THINK NINETY DAYS -- WE MAY OR MAY NOT GET THAT BUT ALSO SOME ACTIVITIES ARE NOT ELIGIBLE SO SOMETIMES THAT WE CAN GET A LOWER REIMBURSEMENT -- SHARE IF ULTIMATELY SOME OF THE ACTIVITIES WE UNDERTAKE AREN'T ELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENT -- SO IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT VOCALS TYPICALLY CONTRIBUTE -- IF IT'S IF THEIR LOCAL COST SO USUALLY THERE'S A 75% FED CUP FEDERAL COSTS CHAIR. AND THEN THE STATE LOCAL THE RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT REMAINING PRODUCED THE FULL 25% THE LOCAL COST THE STATE USUALLY COVERS UP 25% OF THE 25% WHICH IS ABOUT THE STATE AND SOME CASES HAS WAIT THAT LOCAL COST SHARE THAT SOMETHING YOU MAY HEAR A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT -- LATER TODAY AS WELL. I'M ALSO SOME OF THE TIMING OF THESE REIMBURSEMENTS CAN VERY SO IN TERMS OF CASH FLOW THAT MATTERS RIGHT BECAUSE INITIALLY WE HAVE TO MAKE THE OUTLAYS. AND SOMETIMES IT MIGHT BE A YEAR -- TO BEFORE WE ACTUALLY SEE THE REIMBURSEMENTS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. SO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE -- FIVE AS AS FOLKS I'M SURE WHERE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WAS. REALLY A VERY VERY DESTRUCTIVE -- WILDFIRE SEASON -- WE HAD THE MAJOR ONE COUNTRY FIRES WE HAD A THOMAS FIRE IN THE SUBSEQUENT MED SIDES IT WAS -- VERY VERY DESTRUCTIVE IN THE LEGISLATURE TO AND IN RESPONSE TO THAT AT THE DEADLY AND DEVASTATING FIRES OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET REFLECTED SOME OF THOSE ACTIONS. IT PROVIDED AUGMENTATIONS ARE ABOUT SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY MILLION AMANAT COVERED OF RIGHT YOU THINGS LIKE IT THERE'S OVER TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY SIX MILLION -- FOR FORCED HELL FIRE PREVENTION ACTIVITIES THERE'S MONEY FOR FIREFIGHTING RESOURCES INCLUDING HELICOPTERS -- AND ALSO SUBSTANTIAL FUNDING -- FOR HELPING FOLKS RECOVER FROM THOSE FIRES. ALSO NOTABLY -- THERE WAS A LOT OF LEGISLATIVE ACTION IN TERMS OF POLICY BILLS -- THAT REALLY ADDRESSED SOME OF THE UNDERLYING CAUSES AND TRY TO MAKE THE STATE MORE RESILIENT FOR TOWARDS FIRES WE HIGHLY JUST A FEW OF THEM HERE ON PAGE -- FIVE THERE CERTAINLY MORE THAT THAT -- WERE WERE PASSED LAST YEAR THERE REALLY A BUT WAS QUITE A COMPREHENSIVE -- SET OF BILLS THAT WERE PASSED BOTH RELATED TO WILDFIRE SPECIFICALLY AS WELL AS A NUMBER OF BILLS. ADDRESSING DISASTERS MORE GENERALLY ON SOMEBODY GOT THESE THROUGH THESE VERY QUICKLY -- JUST IN THE INTEREST OF TIME SB -- NINE OH ONE BY SENATOR DODD FOR EXAMPLE THAT WAS THE RESULT OF OF COURSE THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE ON WILDFIRES THAT WAS CHANGES INCLUDING EXPANDING REQUIREMENTS FOR UTILITIES TO DEVELOP WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLAN. AND IT ALSO REQUIRED SUBSTANTIAL FUNDING ABOUT TWO HUNDRED MILLION ANNUALLY FOR FOREST HEALTH AND FIRE PREVENTION ACTIVITIES -- SB TWELVE SIXTY BY SENATOR JACKSON CREATED A BIRD FOSTER VACATION PROGRAM ENHANCED SMOKE MONITORING FROM PRESCRIBED FIRES -- AB TWENTY ONE TWENTY SIX BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER EIGHT MEN -- REQUIRES THE CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS TO ESTABLISH A FORESTRY A CORE PROGRAM AB TWENTY FIVE EIGHTEEN BY AGUIAR-CURRY THAT REQUIRED A FORCED HEALTH TASK FORCE TO DEVELOP RECOMMENDATIONS ON AND WOOD PRODUCTS MANUFACTURING FACILITIES AND TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A GOOD MARKET FOR SOME OF THOSE FOREST PRODUCTS -- AND AB TWENTY NINE ELEVEN BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN. REQUIRED BY THE BOARD OF FORESTRY AND FIRE PROTECTION TO ENGAGE IN CERTAIN LAND USE PLANNING ACTIVITIES AMANAT BILL HAD A LOT OF PROVISIONS RELATED TO DEFENSIBLE SPACE IN. A CLEARANCE REQUIREMENTS ON TRYING TO MAKE US A LITTLE BIT BETTER PROTECTED FOR THOSE FIRES. ANOTHER A NUMBER OF OTHER BELLS A PERSON REQUIRE HAD -- SB -- EIGHT THIRTY THREE THEIR WHOLE WHOLE HOST OF BILLS A LAST YEAR THAT WERE REALLY CHECK TRYING TO BETTER POSITION THE STATE FOR THESE DISASTERS AND FIRES. SO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE SIX UNFORTUNATELY AS AS YOU ALL ARE AWARE -- EVEN DESPITE ALL THE ACTIONS THAT WE TOOK IN 200-017-2000 AND EIGHTEEN WAS EVEN WORSE -- IT WAS REALLY A VERY DEVASTATING YOU AND I KNOW WE'LL HEAR A LOT MORE ABOUT THAT -- SO I'M NOT GOING TO A LOT O DETAIL BUT THE CAMPFIRE WAS -- WAS EXTREMELY DEVASTATING A PARTICULAR TO THE COMMUNITY PARADISE ON THE WALL THE IN HELL'S FIRES WERE ALSO VERY VERY DESTRUCTIVE AND THERE WERE OTHERS AS WELL AS WE HEARD SO -- IS REALLY DEVASTATING YEAR -- PAGE SIX HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE FINANCIAL -- PIECES I KNOW WE'LL HEAR MORE ABOUT THE SORT OF PERSON PERSONAL PIECES SOON -- BUT THE STATE USE THAT TRIO A PROCESS THAT I MENTIONS TO ALLOCATE FUNDS IN THE CURRENT YEAR. TO HELP ADDRESS RESPONSE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE FIRES AND THE TABLE ON PAGE SIX SUMMARIZES -- THAT FINANCIAL OUTLAY THAT THE STATE MADE SO OR IS MAKING -- SO YOU'LL SEE A FEW THINGS JUST THE BOTTOM LINE NUMBERS ARE PRETTY STRIKING -- OVER THREE BILLION DOLLARS AN ESTIMATED COSTS IN TERMS OF LARGE IN TERMS OF RESPONDING TO AND RECOVERING FROM THOSE. DISASTERS. WE DO ANTICIPATE BUT THE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL MEMBERS ARE QUITE A BIT -- SO THIS IS THE ADMINISTRATION'S ESTIMATE THEY'RE ESTIMATING -- THAT COULD BE HIGHER OR LOWER -- BUT I'M EVEN WITHOUT MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF STATE NAT COSTS THE GENERAL FUND SO THAT'S QUITE SUBSTANTIAL -- YOU'LL ALSO THERE'S A COUPLE OTHER THINGS HERE JUST THE NUMBER OF DEPARTMENTS INVOLVED IN THIS IS ACTUALLY A CONDENSED WEST -- SO THEY'RE ACTUALLY EVEN MORE DEPARTMENTS WE HAVE OTHER DEPARTMENTS HERE THAT THIS DIRECTION COULD SEVERAL SO LOT OF DEPARTMENTS INVOLVED -- BUT YOU'LL ALSO NOTICE BY FAR THE MOST SUBSTANTIAL ACTIVITY IN TERMS OF COST IS DEBRIS REMOVAL -- SAID THE DEBRIS REMOVAL COSTS ARE REALLY -- QUITE LARGE -- WELL OVER TWO BILLION DOLLARS JUST FOR THE CAMPFIRE -- SO IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE ON IT THE BIG BIG EFFORT AND I WILL HEAR MORE ABOUT THAT -- IN TERMS OF WHAT THAT ACTUALLY ENTAILS BUT JUST FROM A DOLLARS AND CENTS AS WELL PERSPECTIVE -- THAT THE IT'S A LOT OF IT'S A LOT SO -- THIS IS HOPEFULLY GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF A SENSE OF SOME OF THE FOLKS INVOLVED -- AND I'M GONNA STOP HERE -- AND I WILL PASS -- PASSED THE MIKE ON TO A YES AND CAL RECYCLED TO TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN FIRES [inaudible] GOOD MORNING. SHE'S NOT GONNA BE THE LA ALONG WE'RE GONNA BRING OVER -- YES SHE'S SHE'S AN EXPERT NOW AND THE DISASTER MANAGEMENT. GOOD MORNING -- CHAIR AND AND MEMBERS -- THANKS PROBABLY UP TO TO TO SPEND SOME TIME WITH YOU THIS MORNING -- JUST BUILDING ON HELEN'S COMMENTS I THINK -- GETS -- THEY ARE NOT GONNA NOTICE YOUR TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WAS REALLY AND I'M PRESIDENT A YEAR FOR DISASTERS IN CALIFORNIA. IN TOTAL -- THE GOVERNOR PROCLAIM SIXTEEN STATES OF EMERGENCY IN -- TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN PUT ON WE ALL FIRE RELATED -- OF THOSE -- SIXTEEN MAJOR EMERGENCIES -- THREE WERE WHERE WE PROCLAIM BY THE PRESIDENT IS MAJOR DISASTER DECLARATIONS MAJOR DISASTER DECLARATIONS DON'T COME EASY THERE'S THAT'S A THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF INFRASTRUCTURE DAMAGE. AND THE REQUIREMENTS TO UP TO ME TO GET THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- TWO WAY AND TO A STATE LIKE CALIFORNIA -- THAT OF COURSE WHAT WAS -- ON THE HEELS OF LAST YEAR'S -- TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN FIRES WHICH YOU KNOW ALL WE ALL KNOW WELL RESULT IN THE LOSS OF ALMOST ELEVEN THOUSAND STRUCTURES AND ALSO RESULTED IN -- IN IN A COUPLE OF BY A MAJOR DISASTER DECLARATION FOR THE WHITE HOUSE -- TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WE ALSO RECEIVED -- WERE ABLE TO GET TWELVE SEPARATE FIRE MANAGEMENT ASSISTANCE GRANTS FROM THE FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THESE ARE THESE ARE SPECIALIZED GRANTS THAT WE GET ON THE FRONT END OF A FIRE FIRE TO GET EIGHT AND A HALF MEN I GUESS THEY'RE CALLED -- THE CRITERIA -- INDICATES THAT IT HAS TO BE THERE'S AN IMMINENT TO A CAN TO STRUCTURE FOR MORE AND THAT THERE'S A POTENTIAL FOR THAT A BAND TO GO INTO A MAJOR DISASTER DECLARATION SO THESE ARE. VERY FAST MOVING FIRES AND AND VERY COMPLICATED AND AND WE HAD TWELVE OF THOSE -- IN TWO THOUSAND AD EIGHTEEN OVERALL -- IN THE YEAR STARTING AT THE BEGINNING OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WITH THE MINUS YOU KNOW MIGHT FLOW AS A RESULT THAT CAME OUT OF THE THOMAS FIRE. AND THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN FIRE SEE EACH -- BEGINNING OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN STARTED WITH THEM ON A C. THE MUD FLOW WITH EXPERIENCE IN. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THIRTEEN MAJOR FIRES WE HAD SOMETHING LIKE SEVEN THOUSAND OVERALL FIRED WITH THIRTEEN MAJOR FIRES IMPACTED OVER EIGHTEEN COUNTIES -- ENDING OF COURSE OF THE YEAR. WITH THE CAMPFIRE THE WALLS THE AND THE HELL'S FIRE SO -- THE WHOLE YEAR WAS FRAMED BY -- A SERIES OF VERY VERY COMPLEX AND AND COMPLICATED EVENTS -- OVERALL -- OVER MILLION ACRES BURNED INTO AND EIGHTEEN THE LOSS OF OVER A HUNDRED TWENTY SIX LIVES -- TWENTY THREE THOUSAND STRUCTURES DESTROYED THAT'S ON TOP TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WE ADAMS LEVIN THOUSAND STRUCTURES DESTROYED. SO LAST COUPLE YEARS PHENOMENAL -- LAID RESOURCE WISE ONE OF THE ROLES OF OF YES OF COURSE MANAGING AND COORDINATING THE STATE'S MUTUAL AID SYSTEM -- IN IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WE RECORDED ALMOST THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND RESOURCES THROUGH THE THROUGH THE MUTUAL AID SYSTEM -- INITIAL CHARGE BY ME TO GIVE YOU SOME AND I THINK IT OR IN YOUR PACKAGE AS WELL -- SOME IDEAS ABOUT THE THE THE THE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE AND RESOURCES THAT WERE MOVING -- AND THE END OF HOW FAST WERE HAVING TO MOVE THOSE RESOURCES MORE MORE AND EVEN THOUGH -- WE WE HAD WE MOVED ALMOST -- THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND RESOURCES WE ALSO HAD TO GO OUT OF STATE -- THOSE ARE IN STAY WHERE TO GO OUT OF STATE FOR A NUMBER OF OF ASSETS -- FOUR HUNDRED ENGINES FROM STATES FROM THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES -- THERE'S A GRAPHIC HERE THAT SHOWS ALL THE STATES THAT WE WERE ABLE TO PULL FROM -- AND YOU COULD SEE THAT -- YOU KNOW ADVANCE. MOVE RIGHT OUT AND WE'RE JUST A LITTLE [inaudible] GO [inaudible] THIS IS. CAN YOU GUYS SIT THERE. SENATORS TO HURT. I THINK SUPPORT TO SEE THE GRAPHICS BECAUSE IT IT REALLY DOES A POINT OUT THE THAT THAT YOU KNOW. RESPONDING TO THE THESE EVENTS -- REQUIRE ALL HANDS ON DECK AND YOU WE HAVE A A VERY ELABORATE -- SYSTEM IN THE COUNTRY THROUGH WHAT WE CALL THE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT ASSISTANCE COMPACT WHERE WE'RE ABLE TO PULL IN RESOURCES FROM THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES WE ALSO GO TO OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS AT THE U. S. FOR SERVICE AND AND THROUGH FEMA TO PULL AN ASSET AND WE'VE GONE OUT OF COUNTRY. BOTH FROM AUSTRALIA AND CANADA TO BE ABLE TO GET OUT OF STATE -- THIS TEST TO HAVE PULLED OUT OF COUNTRY RESOURCES AND WE'VE ALSO GONE TO OUR OUR MILITARY FORCES -- AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND BRINGING IN DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE -- ASSETS -- SO YOU CAN SEE HERE THE NUMBER OF STATES THE PROVIDED RESOURCES IN THE CALIFORNIA AND THIS IS A A PHENOMENAL. EFFORT -- AS WELL WE HAVE OF X. NOT JUST FIRE ASSETS -- WE'VE WE HAD THOUSANDS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. OFFICERS FROM FROM JURISDICTIONS FROM FROM ONE END OF THE THE STATE TO THE OTHER -- AND THEY CAME FROM ACTUALLY FIFTY FIVE DIFFERENT STATE AGENCIES WERE VERY INVOLVED IN THE LAW ENFORCEMENT SIDE OF IT CHP WITH FISH AND WILDLIFE PARK CD C. R. A. B. C. EXCEPT HER WE'D WE LEVERAGE ALL OF THOSE. ASSETS AS WELL AS FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENTITIES FROM PARKS AND BE A LAMB. AND THE ROLE IS A NUMBER OF THINGS EVACUATION SUPPORT. TRAFFIC CONTROL SEARCH AND RESCUE -- PATROL TO PROTECT PROTECTION IN CORNER SERVICES UNFORTUNATELY IN THE CASE OF THE CAMP FIRES YOU KNOW -- WE HAVE A LARGE NUMBER OF FATALITIES. AND AND IT WAS A VERY VERY COMPLEX MASS FATALITY MANAGEMENT ISSUE THAT REQUIRED SOME VERY INNOVATIVE -- BUT CAPABILITIES BUT BUT YOU KNOW THAT WE WERE TRYING TO MOVE IN A AT A SPEED AT WHICH WE COULD GET EVERYBODY ACCOUNTED -- FOR IN A TIMELY ENOUGH FASHION AND WERE ABLE TO TO YOU SOME SOME TECHNOLOGY THAT WAS ACTUALLY -- VERY PROMISING INVENT VERY PHENOMENAL TO HELP US GET WHAT WE NEEDED TO GET -- TO AS WELL ARE ARE CALIFORNIA NATIONAL GUARD. ABSOLUTELY PHENOMENAL IN SUPPORT OF THE OVERALL MISSION OF THESE DISASTERS. OVERALL IN TWO THOUSAND A ROUTINE WE DEPLOYED OVER -- THREE THOUSAND NATIONAL GUARD MEMBERS THROUGH MISSION TASKING ASSIGNMENTS HAVE MENTIONED MISSION TASKING AND AND AND THE NATIONAL GUARD DOES EVERYTHING FIVE BOOTS ON THE GROUND AND AND AND SUPPORTING FIRE OPERATIONS. TO LOGISTICS TO YOU KNOW THEY ARE REALLY THE THE ACTION ARM ACROSS THE BOARD -- AS WELL AS THE POINT OVER EIGHTY AIRCRAFT IN SUPPORT OF FIREFIGHTING OPERATION THEY DROPPED OVER THREE MILLION GALLONS OF WATER. AND AND SUPPORTED -- WITH SURVEILLANCE AIRCRAFT AND AND OTHER KINDS OF SATELLITE -- BY EMERGENCY COMMUNICATIONS -- SO -- FROM THE STANDPOINT OF RESOURCES AND RESOURCE MANAGEMENT ALL OF THIS COORDINATED THROUGH THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTER STATE OPERATIONS CENTER WAS ACTIVATED AT THE HUNDRED AND ABOUT A HUNDRED FIFTEEN DAYS LAST YEAR -- THAT WAS IN FOLLOWING TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WAS LIKE A HUNDRED AND TWELVE DAYS SO IF YOU CAN IMAGINE THE OPERATIONS CENTER GOING BASICALLY TWENTY FOUR SEVEN FOR THAT LONG -- TO MANAGE THE THAT NOT JUST THE RESPONSE BUT AS WE WE AS YOU UNDERSTAND WE WILL FROM RESPONSE INTO THE RECOVERY. OF RECOVERY STARTS ALMOST CONCURRENTLY WITH RESPONSE BECAUSE YOU START THINKING ABOUT THE CASCADING -- IMPACTS AND AND HOW WE'RE GOING TO ADDRESS THAT BUT THEN EVENTUALLY ROLLS INTO THINGS AS A TELE MENTIONED -- NOT JUST -- AYE SHELTERING BUT THEN THEN WE ROLL INTO -- ON MY KIND OF MID TERM HOUSING SOLUTIONS AND THEN DEBRIS -- CLARENCE -- AND THEN ULTIMATELY THE ABILITY -- TO TO GET THESE LOCAL COMMUNITIES BACK UP ONLINE THROUGH THE STRATEGIC INITIATIVES OF REBUILDING THE COMMUNITY NOW. FROM FOR ME DESCRIBING IT SOUNDS VERY SMOOTH AND FAST AND AND AND BUT I'M I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THAT NONE OF THAT IS. IS IS LANIER -- IT IS A VERY COMPLEX -- SET OF OF CHALLENGES YEARS REGULATORY THERE'S LEGISLATIVE THERE'S FINANCIAL -- LOCAL STATE FEDERAL -- PRIVATE ALL OF YOU KNOW ALL OF THESE FACTORS COME INTO PLAY AND THEN YOU CAN NEVER LOSE SIGHT THROUGHOUT ALL OF THAT PROCESS. TO THE DISASTER SURVIVOR THE INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE LOST THEIR HOMES AND BEING ABLE TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO PIVOT AROUND ENSURE THAT. THAT THOSE FOLKS -- ARE BEING CARED FOR AS MUCH AS WE POSSIBLY CAN -- TO DO THAT YOU KNOW WHAT THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS WE ESTABLISH SOMETHING AT THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTER CALLED UNIFIED COORDINATION GROUP IS THE HIGHEST LEVEL STATE COORDINATION BODY -- IT'S IT'S MADE UP THE GOVERNOR'S CABINET -- AS WELL AS OUR REPRESENTATIVES FROM FROM FEMA ARE ARE FEDERAL COUNTERPART. TO BE ABLE TO SET THE OBJECTIVES AND PRIORITIES BY WHICH WE ARE ARE ARE THAT THE STATE IS POSITIONING ITSELF TO RESPOND -- IN THIS CASE WE WERE MANAGING HELLO [inaudible] TO SIGNIFICANT CATASTROPHIC EVENTS TWO SEPARATE ENDS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA MUCH LIKE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WHAT WE HAD THE NORTH BAY FIRES AND THEN WE HAD THE FIRES THE THOMAS FIRE AND RIVER AND VENTURA. AND THEN THE MINUS YOU TO MUD SLIDES AGAIN THIS YEAR WE'RE MANAGING THE CAMPFIRE ON THE HEELS OF THE CAR FIRING SHASTA COUNTY WHICH WAS ALSO A PRESIDENTIAL DECLARED DISASTER. AND THE MINUS YOUR COMPLEX FIRE WHICH NOW TO THIS DATE IS THE LARGEST LAND MASS FIRE THAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE STATE'S HISTORY. AS WELL AS THE WALLS IN HILLS FIRE THAT WERE HAPPENING IN MALIBU AND AND THE SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS A BIT AND BEEN TURNED LA COUNTY. SO RESOURCES HAVING TO BALANCE THOSE RESOURCES OUT NOT JUST IN THE RESPONSE IN MAKING SURE THAT WE HAD WHAT WE HAD THERE BUT BUT BAND BEGINNING THOSE RECOVERY PROCESS SEES -- TO ESTABLISH -- PRIORITIES AND OBJECTIVES COORDINATION GROUP -- WE BUILD A SECONDARY TASK FORCES -- THAT WILL. HELP -- TO MANAGE COMPONENTS SO FOR EXAMPLE THESE TASK FORCES INCLUDE SHELTER. HOUSING SCHOOLS ANIMALS WATERSHED AND DEBRIS THOSE ARE THOSE ARE ARE ARE ARE AREAS WHERE WE WILL THEN HAVE -- UP TECHNICAL EXPERTS PIECE IN SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTISE STATE LOCAL FEDERAL POSSIBLY PRIVATE ALL COMING TOGETHER. IN THOSE TASK FORCES FIRST TASK FORCES ARE TYPICALLY LEAD -- BY -- YES BUT CAN BE OTHER STATE AGENCIES AND LET ME BE CLEAR OF YES IS ROLE IS -- TO PULL ALL THIS TOGETHER TO PROVIDE IT TO LEVERAGE THE THE AUTHORITIES VESTED IN THE GOVERNOR AND THROUGH THE EMERGENCY SERVICES ACT THROUGH ME TO INSURE THAT WE AS A STATE ARE ON THE RIGHT PATH WAY MOVING FORWARD. TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES ALSO REMAIN OUT IN FRONT OF THESE THESE THESE CHALLENGES -- AND WE CANNOT DO THIS ALONE THIS IS A THIS IS REALLY AT ALL ALL WHILE ALL HANDS ON DECK ITS IT'S ALL OF YOU IN YOUR JURISDICTIONS IT'S AS TRUSTED AGENTS IT'S ALSO LOCAL AUTHORITIES -- AND IT'S THE PUBLIC AS WELL THAT WE ALL NEED TO TO WORK THROUGH AND ULTIMATELY WE ESTABLISH WHAT ARE CALLED OUR RECOVERY OF FRAMEWORKS. AND AND THEY BUILD AROUND THINGS LIKE COMMUNITY PLANNING AND CAPACITY BUILDING ECONOMIC RECOVERY HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES HOUSING INFRASTRUCTURE REBUILDING AND NATURAL AND CULTURAL RESOURCES AND THEN MATT IS THAT. THAT LAST PIECE AS WE MOVE INTO THE RECOVERY OF A COMMUNITY THAT HAS BEEN IMPACTED BY DISASTER ALL THROUGH THAT PROCESS. IS AN INFUSION OF STATE DOLLARS THROUGH THE DISASTER PROGRAMS. FEDERAL DOLLARS THAT ARE IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE THROUGH FEMA -- AND A DISASTER PROGRAMS THROUGH THE STAFFORD ACT -- AND THEN OUR OUR WORK WITH THE CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION IN SEEKING A SUPPLEMENTAL DISASTER APPROPRIATION BASED UPON WHAT WE EXPECT THE COST OF DISASTER WOULD BE SO IN THE CASE OF OF THE OF THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN FIRES. WE ARE SEEKING A A SUPPLEMENTAL ABOUT FOUR POINT FIVE BILLION -- AND I THINK -- LAST YEAR TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WAS LIKE FOUR BILLION -- AND AND AND THAT MONEY THAT COMES IN AND OUT ACTUALLY GOES TO FEDERAL AGENCIES LIKE HIDE. AND U. S. T. A. AND AND MANY OTHERS FEMA. WHERE THOSE AGENCIES DâN FEELS THE COFFERS FOR THE PROGRAMS THAT WE CAN LEVERAGE TO MEET THESE -- RECOVERY FRAMEWORK STRATEGIES CELL AND I'VE I'VE JUST BOUGHT FIVE MESSAGE CAN ONLY GO TO OVER BUT THAT'S GENERALLY WERE BRAD ON THE DISASTER RESPONSE RECOVERY. A GOOD MORNING ERIC. UP SCOTT SMITH LINE WITH CAL RECYCLE A THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. TO GIVE A BRIEF UPDATE ON D. -- TO BE REMOVAL OPERATIONS AND WHAT COVER CYCLES ROLE ISN'T AT ALL NEVER -- TO DO THAT CONCISELY HERE OVER THE NEXT FEW MINUTES NOT BE HAPPENING INTERN YOUR QUESTIONS AFTER THAT. SINCE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN COVER CYCLES BEEN MISSION TASKED BY CALLAWAY YES TO ASSIST IN TWENTY THREE TO BREE REMOVAL PROJECTS THAT'S CLEARED ASH AND DEBRIS FROM APPROXIMATELY FIFTY FIVE HUNDRED PROPERTIES -- WE USE THE TERM PROPERTIES BECAUSE WE'RE CLEARING ENTIRE PROPERTIES WERE NOT AS FOCUSED AS THE NUMBER OF STRUCTURES ON ON EACH PROPERTY. THE MAJORITY OF THESE INCIDENTS HAPPEN DUE TO DESTRUCTIVE -- DISASTER RECOVERY EFFORTS AS YOU'VE HEARD ARE A MULTI AGENCY EFFORT. WE COLLABORATE VERY CLOSELY WITH -- THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES FOR PRIMARY MANAGEMENT OF THESE OPERATIONS WE ALSO CORNET CLOSELY WITH OTHER STATE AGENCIES SUCH AS THE TSC INDEED YES. AS WELL AS BEING ON US EPA. WE ALSO COR NAY WOULD TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS MORE TROUBLE MONITORING IS INDICATED IN OF COURSE WE COLLABORATE VERY CLOSELY WITH THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. WHO HAVE REQUESTED THIS ASSISTANT? WE HAVE A FEW CORE PRINCIPLES IN OUR OPERATIONS THOSE ARE SAFETY COMMUNICATION AND DOCUMENTATION SAFETY IS ALWAYS OUR NUMBER ONE PRIORITY. THAT INSURERS CREW SAFETY RESIDENTS SAFETY COMMUNITY SAFETY. DURING AND AFTER OUR OPERATIONS. COMMUNICATION MEANS COMMUNICATING WITH RESIDENTS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS PARTNER AGENCIES AND WITHIN THE TEAMS. TO MAINTAIN AWARENESS AND BE ABLE TO PROBLEM SOLVE EFFECTIVELY. WE DOCUMENT SITES WE DOCUMENT EXPECTATIONS WE DOCUMENT DELIVERABLES AND OUTCOMES. AND THAT ENSURES FISCAL AND OPERATIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY. THE STATE OVERALL PROGRAM REFLECTS THE NEED TO ADDRESS THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY THE ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS A STRUCTURAL FIRES. AS WELL AS TO FACILITATE THE QUICKEST POSSIBLE RECOVERY FOR EACH COMMUNITY. IT INVOLVES THE REMOVAL OF HOUSEHOLD HAZARDOUS WASTE AS WAS INDICATED INITIALLY BY THE DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL. AND THEN THE STRUCTURALLY SOUND GERMANY'S. HAZARD TREES BURN VEHICLES. BURNED PERSONAL EFFECTS AND POSSESSIONS. ASH CONCRETE METAL AND CONTAMINATED SOILS. ONCE A PARTIAL IS CLEARED AND SOIL SEVEN X. SO EXPERT ME SOIL SAMPLING CONFIRMS THAT WE RESTORE CLEAN UP GOAL. WHICH MEANS ALIGNING THE PARTIAL TO PRE FIRE CONDITIONS. EROSION CONTROL MEASURES ARE PUT IN PLACE AND PROPERTIES RETURNED THE COUNTY INTO THE SURVIVOR. AND IS READY FOR REBUILDING. COVER CYCLE SPECIFICALLY CONTRACTS FOR DEBRIS REMOVAL CONTRACTOR AND FOR AN ASSESSMENT AND MONITORING CONSOLE. THIS INCLUDES THE SOLICITATION AWARD AN ONGOING MANAGEMENT OF THESE CONTRACTS. WE PROVIDE STEP RESOURCES TO THE IMPACTED AREA TO SUPPORT THE INCIDENT MANAGEMENT TEAM AS WAS DISCUSSED. WHICH OVERSEES PROJECT OPERATIONS HEALTH AND SAFETY PLANNING. AND FINANCE AND ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES. PRIOR TO TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN DEBRIS REMOVAL PROJECT WERE LIMITED TO ONE OR TWO INCIDENTS PER YEAR. WITH A MAXIMUM PROPERTY NUMBER OF THAT TIME OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY SIX PROPERTIES. SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THERE'S BEEN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE OBVIOUSLY IN BOTH THE SEVERITY AND THE NUMBER OF INCIDENTS. FOR YEAR. WE ARE NOW REGULARLY MANAGING MULTIPLE CONCURRENT DEBRIS REMOVAL CLEANUPS WHICH NOW SPANNED YEAR ROUND. COSTS THAT WERE ONCE IN THE LOW SINGLE DIGIT MILLIONS ARE NOW IN THE BILLION DOLLAR RANGE AND THE COMPLEXITY. OF THESE NOW MASSIVE CLEANUP HAVE DRASTICALLY INCREASED. AND TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN COVER CYCLE REMOVE DEBRIS FROM APPROXIMATELY NINETEEN HUNDRED PROPERTIES RESULTING FROM DESTRUCTIVE THOMAS KLAMATH ON CAR. MENDOCINO COMPLEX PANI FIRES THE LATER FOR WHICH WERE CONCURRENT. DEBRIS REMOVAL PROJECTS. ADDITIONALLY WE REMOVE DEBRIS FROM THE RESULTING MUDSLIDES ANTENNA BARBARA COUNTY THAT FOLLOW THE THOMAS FIRE. THAT DEBRIS TOGETHER WAS ALMOST A MILLION TONS OF DEBRIS. KERN TO BE CLEAN UP OPERATIONS INCLUDE THE CAMP WILLS IN HELL FIRES. THE CAMPFIRE LOAN IS AN ESTIMATED FOURTEEN THOUSAND PROPERTIES REQUIRED REMOVAL DEBRIS REMOVAL OPERATION FOR THE CAMPFIRE ARE ESTIMATED AT TWELVE MONTHS. AN INITIAL ESTIMATE ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION THE CAMPFIRE DEBRIS REMOVAL PROJECT WILL BE THE LARGEST AND MOST EXPENSIVE DISASTER CLEANUP THAT WE HAVE UNDERTAKEN. THE WALLS IN HELL FIRES OF A COMBINED ESTIMATE OF THIRTEEN HUNDRED PROPERTIES. WHICH WILL REQUIRE DEBRIS REMOVAL WITH AN ESTIMATED COST OF A HUNDRED AND FORTY THREE MILLION AND TO WORK NOTING. THAT WE NOT AT THE CAMPFIRE THE WILL BE FAR WOULD'VE BEEN THE LARGEST PART WE NEVER HAD. IN TERMS OF PROPERTIES. FOR THE FIRST TIME DEBRIS REMOVAL OPERATIONS. FROM THE PREVIOUS YEAR WILL BE ON GOING. THROUGH THE ENTIRE NEXT FIRE SEASON. THAT WILL CREATE NEW CHALLENGES. OVERALL THE MANAGEMENT WHILE BY RECOVERY EFFORTS HAVE BEEN ON ONGOING YEAR ROUND EFFORT AT CAL OR CYCLE FOR A FEW YEARS NOW. WE ARE ENGAGED IN CONVERSATION WITH OUR STATE PARTNERS ABOUT HOW WE CAN CONTINUE TO BE RESPONSIVE TO THE STATE GIVEN THESE TRENDS INCREASED WILDFIRE. SO THANK YOU NOT BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'LL JUST SIT HERE TRYING TO WRAP MY HEAD YOU SAID A HUNDRED MILLION TONS OF DEBRIS. ONE MILLION ONE MILLION OKAY START. THAT'S VIOLATE HONORED THAT I MISSPOKE HIGH I THINK I JUST GOT SO OVERWHELMED WITH YOUR NUMBER I MADE IT EVEN MORE EACH FISHY BUT A MILLION TONS OF DEBRIS IS CHEST BEYOND. THE PALE AND IT'S I'VE GOT THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND JUST COLLEAGUES SO YOU'LL KNOW -- YOU'LL NOTICE ON THE AGENDA. SECURE DID SHE WILL BE WITH US THE ANSWER QUESTIONS ON THE FINAL THE SECOND AND THIRD PANELS WE APPRECIATE -- YOUR WILLINGNESS TO STAY FOR THE ENTIRE HEARING I HAVE LASTED A MINING FIRST FOLLOWED BY FIFTY MCGUIRE. WELL THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND FOR YOUR STAFF FOR ORGANIZING. WHAT'S IMPORTANT TIMELY I WANT TO THANK THE DIRECTOR AND ALL OF YOUR TEAM -- RESOURCES AND RECYCLING. LA -- YOU PAINT A DRAMATIC PICTURE. MANY YEARS OF US HAVE LIVED THROUGH IT IN MANY ARE CONTINUING TO TRY TO RECOVER FROM THE IMPACTS. MY QUESTIONS RELATE. TO PROJECTIONS I HEARD NO REFERENCE TO CLIMATE CHANGE. OR CHANGED CONDITION I THINK GOVERNOR BROWN DESCRIBED IT IS THE NEW ABNORMAL. WHAT DO YOU PROJECT BASED ON THESE LAST TWO YEARS OF? VIRTUALLY YEAR ROUND FIRE OF ANTS. AND THEN FOLLOWED. BY FLOOD EVENTS. HOW DO YOU PREPARE MOVING FORWARD FOR YOUR PROJECTIONS WILL THIS? NEXT CALENDAR YEAR -- DO YOU ANTICIPATE SIMILAR MULTIPLE INCIDENTS HAPPENING -- SO THAT'S ONE QUESTION PROJECTIONS FOR THE FUTURE. AND CONNECTIONS TO CLIMATE CHANGE. I BELIEVE OUR BUDGET IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT NINE OUR FIRE SUPPRESSION BUDGET WAS AROUND SEVENTY MILLION. NOW WE'RE UP TO ABOUT A BILLION -- IN SECOND COMPONENT IS. THE FEDERAL SHARE. YOU ESTIMATED BEING ABOUT 75% HOW MUCH OF THAT FEDERAL SHARE FOR THIS. THESE RECENT FIRES IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN HAS BEEN RECEIVED OR COMMITTED OR WHEN WE GET ANSWERS TO THAT. THANK YOU A QUICK QUESTION -- WELL BOTHER LOOKING MY CRYSTAL BALL ABOUT NEXT YEAR. AND THIS COMING YEAR -- YOU KNOW GOVERNOR BROWN WAS WAS CORRECT I MEAN IS IT IS THE NEW ABNORMAL I IT IS SOMETHING THAT WEEK WE ARE -- WE HAVE READ GAUGED FOR AND AND ANTICIPATING -- BASICALLY THIS BEING THE WAY THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BE DEALING WITH THINGS WE CANNOT. WAIT. AND SEE WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN -- WE NEED TO REMAIN OUT IN FRONT OF WHAT WE BELIEVE WITH ALL THE AVAILABLE. SCIENCE AND THEN LOOKING BACK AT THE EXPERIENCES OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS -- I GOT WILL TELL YOU THAT THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE STILL SUFFERING THE RESULTS OF OF THE OR THE OUTCOMES OF A SIX YEAR DROUGHT THAT WAS. THAT IN PART TO THE STATE THAT STILL HAPPENING IN IN THAT WITH THE DROUGHT AND SO -- THOSE ARE FACTORS WHERE -- WE ARE -- WE ARE GEARING UP WANT ONE FOR EXAMPLE WE ARE UP TO ADDRESS THAT WE HAVE RESTRUCTURE THE STATE'S HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN -- THAT IF THAT IS THE THE STATE'S SORT OF BIBLE FROM FOR MEDICATION TO INCORPORATE A VERY SIGNIFICANT CLIMATE ADAPTATION SECTION WITH A SERIES OF ACTIONS TO BUY DOWN THE THE RISK OF OF CLIMATE RELATED IMPACTS. WE PUSH THAT DOWN TO ALL OF OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO AS THEY BUILD THEIR OR HOW AN UPDATE OR HAS A MITIGATION PLAN AROUND THE STATE'S PLAN -- THAT WE THINK THAT WITH THE FEDERAL WE HAVE -- GOOD OBVIOUSLY ALL THE WORK THAT THAT THE YOU ARE HOT DOWN OVER THE LAST YEAR TO HELP US PREPARE AND GET TO A PLACE WHERE WE ARE -- BETTER THAN WE WERE THE PREVIOUS YEAR -- ONE AREA FOR EXAMPLE THAT WERE WERE WERE WORKING ON NOW WE START IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WAS. WORKING -- TO GET A BETTER FIDELITY OF ALL. WERE RED FLAG CONDITIONS PRIOR TO FIRE IGNITIONS -- AND THEN PRE POSITIONING ASSETS INTO AREAS WHERE THEY WOULD BE BETTER -- A BETTER POSITION TO RESPOND MORE RAPIDLY -- TO SUPPRESS FIRES AND WE WE WE AND AND IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WE THAT THAT WAS EIGHTY SIX TIMES WE WE DO WE PRE DEPLOYED. ASSETS ANOTHER FIRE ASSETS TO RESCUE ASSETS HELICOPTERS DISPATCHERS ECCENTRIC WHERE WERE WE UPS UP STAFF THE SYSTEM THAT'S A LESSON LEARNED FROM THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN FIRES AND MUCH OF THE WORK THAT WAS DONE ON THE A SHOOTING THAT IS NOW A PROGRAM THAT IS. IN PLACE AND CONTINUES TO BE REFINED WITHIN WITHIN -- YES -- AND SO I GUESS THE SHORT PART OF THAT A SENATOR IS THAT -- WELL WE HAVE TO EXPECT THAT THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WILL BE A MUCH LIKE -- TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND SO WE CAN'T SIT BACK AND AND WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO TO BUILD OUT ON THAT -- THANK YOU AND THEN THE FEDERAL JOB ON THE FEDERAL PIECE -- SO -- TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WE WERE ABLE TO GET -- FOR A PERIOD OF TIME INITIALLY ON THAT FIRE A 100% -- COST RECOVERY FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR THE FIRST THIRTY DAYS AS FOR TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN FIRST THIRTY DAYS FOR EMERGENCY PROTECTIVE MEASURES -- AND AND RESPONSE COSTS AND THEN WE WERE ABLE TO WORK -- WITH -- THE CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION AND THEY WROTE IN -- IN THE APPROPRIATIONS BILL A NINETY TEN COST WAIVER FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE DISASTER -- WHICH IS VERY HELPFUL BECAUSE THAT WAS YOU KNOW THE THE THE PRE OPERATION AND CINNAMON APPLE LAKE EXCEPT YOUR WAS A CLOSE ABOUT TWO BILLION DOLLARS SO THAT WAS A A HUGE. FACTOR FOR THE STATE THIS YEAR -- THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS ESTABLISHED THE THE AMOUNT AT THE THE DESIGNATED -- STATUETTE WHICH IS SEVENTY SHARE WEAVER WE HAVE WE HAVE SOUGHT THROUGH THE NORMAL PROCESS OF OF SEEKING COST YOUR WAIVER FROM THE WHITE HOUSE -- AND SO FAR THAT HAS NOT. MATERIALIZED SO WHAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH IT IS BEEN WORKING WITH THE CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION AND IT IS IS BEING WRITTEN INTO A SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATION BILL FOR NINETY TEN FOR FOR ALL THE FIRES BOTH THE NORTH AND SOUTH. AND WE'RE JUST WAITING FOR THAT BILL TO TO GET THROUGH -- BOTH HOUSES THANK YOU IN A FINAL QUESTION IF I MIGHT MADAM CHAIR I KNOW OTHERS HAVE QUESTIONS BUT WHEN YOU HAVE THESE MULTIPLE LARGE INCIDENT SIGN OF THE MUTUAL AID IS CRITICAL IN ITS MULTI STATE ITS MULTINATIONAL. BUT HOW ARE WE EQUIPPED FOR ADEQUATE PERSONNEL. AND THEN THE FATIGUE FACTOR IN THE MENTAL HEALTH FACTOR OF THIS NEW ABNORMAL -- WHAT IS BEING DONE TO PROTECT THE FIREFIGHTERS ON THE FRONT LINE FROM -- FOR THEIR OWN HEALTH AND SAFETY IN LONG TERM MENTAL HEALTH. INSURANCE SO -- IT'S A HUGE ISSUE -- AS I MENTIONED IN MY MY EARLIER TESTIMONY YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE WE'VE BEEN GOING TWENTY FOUR SEVEN THREE SIXTY FIVE FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS NOW ACTUALLY -- I THINK I'M I MENTIONED LEAVE AT TWELVE PRESIDENTIAL DISASTER DECLARATIONS BEFORE THAT THE THE MOST PREVIOUS ONE WAS IN. TWO THOUSAND EIGHT SO AGES THIRTEEN TO THROUGH EIGHTEEN WE'VE HAD TWELVE SO. THE AMOUNT OF OF OF EFFORT -- AND WHAT THE FIREFIGHTERS SEE WE ALSO -- WILL TELL YOU THAT -- JUST IN THE CAMP FIRE ALONE -- THERE WERE SOME OVER THREE THOUSAND UNABLE TO FILL ORDERS -- THAT -- THAT THAT WE YOU KNOW WE JUST HAD TO WORK AROUND THAT MEANS FOR FIREFIGHTERS ON THE LINE. MORE MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL MORE EMERGENCY MEASURE PERSONNEL MORE LAW ENFORCEMENT ON THE LINE IN THE FIELD FOR LONGER PERIODS OF TIME THAT'S MORE EXPOSURE TO THE ENVIRONMENT TO THE SITUATION. IT'S MORE STRESS WE'RE SEEING A HIGHER RATE OF OF OF POST IS DISASTER AND POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS -- IMPACTS AND THE I I THINK IT'S REALLY SOMETHING THAT THE THE GOVERNOR IN THIS IN THIS CAR BUDGET IS PROPOSED -- A WELLNESS -- A STUDY INTO TO LOOK AT SOME WAYS TO ADDRESS THAT -- BUT I I THINK WE AS A BODY NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT. WE WERE REALLY WERE LEARNING YOU KNOW BURN OUT OUR FOLKS AND IT IS -- AND IT'S WHAT WHAT IS THE BALANCE YOU HAVE ADVANCE THEIR HAPPENING YOU HAVE TO RESPOND TO HIM YOU HAVE TO RECOVER FROM. YOU KNOW WHAT WERE OR YES MANAGING IT WE DON'T EAT ME AS A RESPONSE BUT THEN WE WE ALSO MANAGING THE RECOVERY. AND BUT THERE'S NO YOU KNOW FAILURE IS NOT AN OPTION SO YOU HAVE. TO SUCK IT UP AND AND RESPONDED SO. YOU TRY TO WORK WITH LIKE WORK LIFE BALANCE WITH YOUR EMPLOYEES BUT I I WILL TELL YOU I'M I'M SEEING IT. WITH MY STAFF I'VE SEEN IT WITH MANY OTHERS. SOME FIRE FOLKS SOME RESPOND THE COME OFF UNLESS THEY'RE ORDERED BACK THEN YOU KNOW THEY DON'T WANT TO COME BACK OF TO WORK TO WORK FOR A WHILE THEY NEED THAT BREAK -- ENTERS CASCADING IMPACTS TO REMEMBER OUR WHAT OUR OF OUR FAMILIES ARE PART OF THE THE PUBLIC SAFETY FAMILY AS WELL SO IT'S NOT THE THE FIREFIGHTER ON THE LINE BUT IT'S THE WIVES AND THE CHILDREN AND AND THE SPOUSES AND ECCENTRICITY. WE NEED TO IT IS SOMETHING THAT IS VERY VERY CONCERNING AND THE MORE WE GET BUT THESE EVENTS AND IF IT CONTINUES LIKE THIS. I THINK IT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO TO REALLY DO -- MUCH MORE INVESTMENT IN. JUST ON THAT POINT. I AM. PLEASED TO HEAR THAT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES STUDYING THE SAME PACKS. BUT I WOULD SUBMIT FUTURE BUDGETS NEED. TO INCLUDE. THE RESOURCES NECESSARY FOR RELIEF TREATMENT -- IN ORDER. OPEN DOORS FOR FOLLOW UP THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR TEAMS. EXTRAORDINARY WORK THE ALWAYS BUT ESPECIALLY THESE LAST TWO YEARS. GREATLY APPRECIATED THANK YOU SAID SENATOR MCGUIRE FOLLOWED BY SENATORS MORE LOCK IN STERN CENTER MCGUIRE BECAUSE MUCH VENTURE AND APPRECIATE YOU HAVE SINCE HERE AND I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT. TO SAY THANK YOU TO A DOCTOR DUE TO FOR HIS INCREDIBLE WORK AT GETTING KNOWN SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN IN THE VALLEY FIRE AND ALL THROUGHOUT. THE NORTH A FIRE STORM THERE'S NO ONE THAT DOES A BETTER AND WE'RE SO GLAD THAT HE IS NOT RETIRED -- SO -- I'M NOT SURE IF HE'S SAYING THAT BUT BUT YEAH HE IS -- HE'S TRULY A GIFT TO THE STATE ALONG WITH HIS TEAM JUST WANT TO SAY HOW GRATEFUL WE ARE -- HOW ARE UNDER RESOURCE WE ARE SPECIAL WITH CAL FIRE IN REGARDS TO A FIRE ENGINES? WERE THIRTY ONE SHORT THIS YEAR THIRTY ONE SHORT OF WHERE WE'RE AT IN -- NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE AND GRATEFUL THAT THE GOVERNOR IN -- IS ADVANCING -- FUNDING FOR THIRTEEN BUT BUT EVEN AT THAT WERE STILL BELOW NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE STAFFING LEVELS. WHEN IT COMES ENGINES PERSONNEL FOR CAUGHT FIRE? AND WE'RE SEEING THE WORST WILDLAND FIRE DISASTERS -- IN OUR NATION'S HISTORY RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA -- IS SIX MILLION IN THE BUDGET THAT THE GOVERNOR -- THANKS TO LEADERSHIP OF BOTH CALIFORNIA WE S. FOR ADDITIONAL A PSYCHOLOGICAL SERVICES. FOR FIREFIGHTERS BUT NEED TO ADVANCE THAT FIVE MILLION FOR THE LONG TERM STUDY. IN THE IMPACTS OF WILDLAND FIRE SMOKE THE TOXIC SMOKE A IT WAS A BILL THAT I CENTER LEYVA ADVANCE ASSN BILL SEVEN SEVENTY FOUR ASSURING CRUCIATE HER LEADERSHIP ON THAT ALONG WITH. LOCAL TWENTY EIGHT EIGHTY ONE COW FROM PROFESSIONAL FIRE HERE -- WOULD LIKE TO TALK ABOUT PRE POSITIONING JUST REAL QUICK YET MENTION IT THANK YOU. FOR YOUR FIGHT ON THAT -- ONE AS WE TAKE A LOOK INTO THIS YEAR LESSONS LEARNED IF YOU DON'T MIND BEING QUICK ON THAT -- AND THEN I WOULD LIKE TO TALK ABOUT RECEIVE HER. TO NINE ONE ONE GO TO SELL LESSONS LEARNED ON PRE POSITIONING WELL ON THE ON THE PRE POSITION I I YOU KNOW I THINK THAT WE WE CAN WE CONTINUE. TO REFINE THE THE THE WAY THE CRITERIA AND THE WAY WE MOVE THESE RESOURCES THE PRE POSITIONED THEM -- ONE ONE BIG FACTOR IN PRE POSITIONING OBVIOUSLY IS THAT -- YOU KNOW IF AND I USE THIS EXAMPLE -- YOU KNOW THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE SAYS THESE ARE GOING TO BE A RED FLAG CONDITIONS YOU KNOW OVER OVER ARCHING SEVEN COUNTIES SO THE QUESTION IS WHAT WHERE DO YOU PLACE THOSE RESOURCES. WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO BE MOST EFFECTIVE AND SO SO ONE OF THE? LESSONS LEARNED WEEK WE'VE WE'VE KNOWN IT AND WE'RE WORKING TOWARDS ADDRESSING IT-- AND HOPEFULLY THIS LEGISLATIVE SESSION WILL GET THROUGH -- NINE THROUGH -- THE ASSESSMENT -- AND ANALYSIS OF OF MICRO CLIMATES -- WITHIN PORTIONS OF THE COUNTY BASED UON HIGH HIGH SURVEYOR HIGH EVERITY TEAR WANTING TO TEAR -- TO MAPS THAT MAKE IT MAKE IT BETTER EDUCATION THAT IF WE'RE GONNA HAVE A WEATHER EVENT. INS IN IN A PARTICULAR COUNTY. THEY WE CAN CROSS OVER WITHOUT THE DATA ANALYTICS THAT THAT WE HAVE AND THEN LOOK AT REAL TIME -- WHETHER -- I DATED THAT WERE COMING OUT OF KEY AREAS -- WITHIN THE WITHIN THE WHILE THERE BY LAND URBAN INTERFACE -- AND AND AND TAKE THAT THEY LIVE MAKE ANALYSIS TO HELP US DETERMINE THAT INSTEAD OF STICKING RESOURCES IN THE MIDDLE OF A FIVE COUNTY AREA WE'RE GONNA PUT RESOURCES WHERE WE BELIEVE THAT FIRE STARTS ARE GOING TO EITHER START OR OR OR THERE IS THE HIGHEST RISK OF OF IMPACT. WE CAN THEN BUILD AROUND THAT -- BUT WE CAN BUILD AROUND THAT IN ALERT AND WARNING OF THE PUBLIC AS IN THAT AREA WE CAN GET THEM BETTER PREPARED -- AND AND AND AND IT HELPS US. BUT A COUPLE STEPS OUT IN FRONT OF IT SO WE'RE CONTINUING TO EVOLVE THAT PROCESS -- CENTER IN AND I I I I THINK ALSO SAY THAT WE WE'VE WE'VE LEARNED ALREADY THAT THE PRE POSITIONING IS A A POSITIVE -- ADDITION AND IT HELPS TO GET RESOURCES -- ON ON FIRES FAST WE'VE HAD SOME REALLY SUCCESSFUL RESULTS OF THAT IN -- I IT ALSO HELPS TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE THE PRE POSITIONED RESOURCES IS A IT'S NOT JUST AN AUGMENTATION FOR FOR THE STATE IT THIS HELPS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AS WELL -- IN MAY ONE UP HELPS THEM PLAN IT UP SOME PLAN FOR SURE IT MAKES THEM START THINKING ABOUT WHAT WHAT IS THE CHALLENGE IT WITHIN THEIR THEIR RESPECTIVE JURISDICTION -- AND UP AND AND AND IT ALLOWS US TO HAVE A BETTER A COLLABORATION WITH THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT -- AND THEN YOU AS YOU SAW FROM THE SLIDES -- YOU KNOW THE MAJORITY OF ASSETS THAT E YOU KNOW CAL FIRE AS A LOT ASSETS THERE BUT THE MAJORITY OF ASSETS THAT COME. ON A ON A TO RESPOND ALL THESE FIRES COMES FROM THE MUTUAL AID SYSTEM AND THAT'S LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND SO WE'RE REALLY PRESSING -- THEM AND AND WE WE KNOW THAT ONE TO EVOLVE TO LESSON LEARNED IS TO GET THIS. A LOT OF LEVERAGE TECHNOLOGY BETTER GOOD SITUATIONAL AWARENESS TOOLS TO BE ABLE TO GET A BETTER IDEA ABOUT WHERE THE THREAT IS ACTUALLY NO THANK YOU -- EMERGENCY ALERTS IF YOU COULD BRIEFLY JUST COMING TO ON YOU KNOW YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ON ADVANCING THOSE NEW GUIDELINES PART OF FIRE SEASON. HITTING US HERE IF YOU CAN JUST UPDATE US ON THAT -- AND THEN I JUST HAVE A QUICK% QUESTION FOR DIRECTOR SMITH LINE AS WELL -- SO -- BULLARD MORNING -- WE'VE BEEN WORKING DID DILIGENTLY WE CONVENE. A TECHNICAL COMMITTEE -- AS PART OF THE STATE'S STANDARDIZED EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT -- ADVISORY BODY IT'S IT'S THE BOB BODY THIS IN STATUTE THE DRIVES ARE STANDARDIZED EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM THAT TECHNICAL COMMITTEE WAS MADE UP OF LOCAL STATE AND AND AND FEDERAL. COUNTERPARTS -- AND THEY CAME UP WITH SOME JUST TO PROVE THE EVERYBODY AND LAST THE WEEK I THINK OR MAYBE MONDAY I CAN KNOW WHAT DAY IT IS TODAY -- SO -- WE DOES DOES GUIDELINE SHOULD BE HITTING THE STREET HERE -- WITHIN THE NEXT WEEK OR SO AND BATTLE THEN BEGIN TH PROCESS OF WORKING -- WILL FOLLOW UP WITH A CONTACT WITH ALL THE COUNTIES -- AND AND THE CITY'S -- TO BEGIN THE PROCESS OF INSURING THAT -- THAT -- YOU KNOW THOSE GUIDELINES ARE BEING INCORPORATED INTO -- LOCAL AUTHORITIES WE CAN GET THAT BASS LINE WHERE AT LEAST YOU KNOW EVERYBODY'S ON THE SAME PAGE ON ON A WRITTEN WARNING. YEAH AND I THINK THAT THAT WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO FOLLOW UP ON MAKING SURE THAT EVERY COUNTY HAS THE ABILITY WHITE WE AND I KNOW THERE'S THAT THERE'S SOME STICK IN THERE AS WELL -- IF COUNTIES ARE IN IMPLEMENTING THE COULD SEE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT GRANTS -- GOING AWAY BUT WE CAN TALK MORE ABOUT THAT. MANAGER JUST ONE LAST QUESTION FOR DIRECTORS MISALIGNED -- BUT ONE POINT TWO FIVE MILLION WAS ADVANCED LAST YEAR IN THE BUDGET TO BE ABLE TO STAFF UP AND I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR CHRISTMAS TIME FOR YOUR WORK YOU YOU HAVE. A RELATIVELY SMALL SHOP WHEN IT COMES TO THE DEBRIS REMOVAL AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF WORK AND I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO YOUR TEAM YOURSELF -- AND WANT TO SEE WHERE YOU'RE AT ON THAT BECAUSE WERE SEEN. AS THAT MAN CHAIR HAD JUST MENTION RECORD LEVELS OF BURKE DEBRIS UNDERSTAND THIS BEEN A FEDERAL OPERATION. BUT IN THE NEW REALITY THAT WE'RE IN WE'RE GONNA NEED TO STATE OPERATION NUMBER -- ONE THE EXPERTISE WITHIN YOUR SHOP IT'S JUST LIKE FEMA DIES AT TO BE ABLE TO MOVE IN A QUICK AND EFFICIENT MANNER INTO COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE IMPACTED. BY WILDFIRE OR BY EARTHQUAKES IN DIRECTOR GEORGE PLEASE -- CHIME IN ON THIS ONE AS WELL IF YOU'D LIKE BUT THIS IS MY FIND WHERE YOU AT WITH STAFF AND UP AND YOUR THOUGHT ON THOSE PRIME CONTRACTORS -- THANK YOU SENATOR FOR THE INQUIRY -- THESE ARE CRITICAL RESOURCES FOR THE DEPARTMENT -- WE HAVE HAD A DIFFICULT TIME FILLING THOSE POSITIONS FOR NUMBER OF REASONS -- WE WERE AUTHORIZED IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET AND SHORTLY THEREAFTER WE WERE. DEALT DIRECTLY BACK INTO WILD FIRE NAM AND IT'S THE SAME RESOURCES THAT WOULD BE BUILDING THAT TEAM MATTER IMMEDIATELY DEPLOYED. FOR EMERGENCY WORK -- WE ALSO -- GENERALLY HAVE. BUT AS I'M LEARNING HAVE A HARD TIME STEPPING UP SOME THESE CLASSIFICATIONS WITHIN GOVERNMENT IN GENERAL ALL THAT NOT WITHSTANDING -- IS NOT TO SAY IT'S NOT BEEN A TOP PRIORITY FOR US. DANCE YOUR QUESTION DIRECTLY WHERE WE ARE IS THAT WE HAVE HIRED THE TEAM LEADER THE SUPERVISOR FOR THAT POSITION -- SO WE HAVE FILLED THAT POSITION WE'VE FILLED ONE OF THE HEALTH AND SAFETY POSITIONS -- WITH RESPECT TO WASTE MANAGEMENT ENGINEER CLASSIFICATIONS WE ARE CURRENTLY SCHEDULING INTERVIEWS. WE HAD -- SOME CHALLENGES GETTING QUALIFIED RESPONSE ON THE LIST THAT WERE AVAILABLE TO US SO WE HAD TO GO OUT WE'RE ON OUR THIRD LIST I BELIEVE -- AND WE'RE BEING AS CREATIVE AS WE CAN TO ATTRACT PEOPLE TO THESE POSITIONS AND THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY HIRING ARE -- INTERVIEWING FOR THOSE WAYS MENTION ENGINEER POSITIONS. I WOULD LIKE THAT AWFUL UP ONLINE OFFLINE MAYBE -- FOLLOW UP WITH A CHAIR MAKOWSKI THE BUDGET SEVEN AND WE CAN BE TOGETHER WITH DIRECTORS FOR FLYING ONTHAT AND SO EVENTUALLY -- PRIME CONTRACTORS BEING ABLE TO BRING THEM IN TO BE ABLE TO DO THE DEBRIS MANAGEMENT AND REMOVAL CAN YOU COMMENT ON THAT ABSOLUTE I THINK THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THIS -- GIVEN THE DIRECTION THAT WE'RE GOING HAVING AT A PROCESS TO FACILITATE BRING ON CONTRACTORS IS GONNA BE VERY IMPORTANT -- WE'RE WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT GENERAL SERVICES ON THAT VERY ISSUE ALONG WITH -- YES TO TRYING TO STREAMLINE THAT PROCESS. AND WE DO THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT. TO YOU SEE THIS MY LAST QUESTION MANAGER YOU SEE EVENTUALLY ONCE YOU'RE ABLE TO GET FULLY STAFFED -- GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS THE PROCUREMENT SOME TYPE. OF A PRIME CONTRACTOR PROCESS SEEN TO BE TO SECURE THOSE VENDORS. I'M SORRY TAKE SECURE IT TO SECURE THE VENDORS WHO YOU'RE GONNA HAVE ON CONTRACTS AND WE DO SEE DISASTER CAN BE REMOVED A DIFFERENT APPROACH MASTER SERVICES APPROACH YES OKAY. THAT'S GREAT BEFORE THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- MISTER SMITH LINE I JUST WANT TO ASK A COUPLE QUESTIONS -- ON STATE RESPONSIBILITY -- I WAS A YOUNG TEENAGER AND MY DAD MOM WOKE ME UP IN THE MIDDLE AND I WE HAD A RUSH OUT OF THE HOUSE BECAUSE THE HOUSE NEXT DOOR WAS ON FIRE THE GARAGE IT STARTED. BURNING UNFORTUNATELY THE FIREWALL KEPT IT FROM HITTING THE REST OF THE HOUSE BUT IT WAS A MEMORABLE NIGHT THEY'LL NEVER FORGET EVEN WATCH MY DAD TRYING TO OPEN THE CAR DOORS TO MOVE THEM AWAY FROM. THE OFFICE. BUT BUT IT WAS THE HOMEOWNERS RESPONSIBILITY THERE TO REMOVE ALL OF THE DEBRIS AND IN WHEN YOU LOOK AT A HOMEOWNER'S INSURANCE POLICY IT IT'S IT THERE'S A COMPONENT AND THEY'RE BUILT ON A REMOVAL OF THE DEBRIS. SO FOR THOSE OF US AND URBAN AND SUBURBAN. AREAS WE WE KIND OF WONDER WHY WITH THE STATE HAVE TO COME IN. AND REMOVE DEBRIS FROM THESE WILDFIRES OWNS AND AYE AYE AYE AND ALWAYS WILL BE CLINICAL ICE WHEN TRYING TO THE DEFINITION OF MAYBE THE HISTORY OF HOW. THAT STARTED IN WHY A EVERYONE IS RESPONSIBLE. FOR AIN'T THROUGH THEIR TAXES FOR FOR THIS SERVICE -- FALL INTO THE PART I CAN I MIGHT DEFERRED TO DIRECTOR GO DUE TO FOR PART OF THE CENTER AS WELL -- THE COST PER DEBRIS REMOVAL GENERALLY EXCEED THE COMPONENTS OF THE INSURANCE THAT ARE ALLOTTED FOR DEBRIS REMOVAL WE DO RECOVER THAT COMPONENT UNDER INSURANCE THAT IS A LOT OF FOR DEBRIS REMOVAL -- I'M GONNA. WITH RESPECT TO THE REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND IF I WOULD I WOULD DEFER TO TRADITION. SO CENTER I THINK ON THE THE CASE BY CASE SOMEBODY WAS HOME BURNS DOWN AND THEIR FIRE INSURANCE TYPICALLY HANDLED BY. HOWEVER THE INSURANCE COMPANY I HIRES -- IS THE THE NORMAL PROCESS FOR A CASE BY CASE EVEN A MODERATELY SMALL MAYBE A COUPLE HOMES. BUT WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE KIND OF OF FIRE IMPACTS THE LOSSES THAT WE'VE BEEN SEEN -- HERE -- THESE EVENTS RESULT IN A COUPLE THINGS FIRST OF ALL THEY RESULT IN A VERY SIGNIFICANT THREAT TO PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAKE THE CAMPFIRE FOR EXAMPLE -- MOST OF THESE HOMES WERE BUILT IN THE SIXTIES AND SEVENTIES THE APP'S BEST THIS AND OTHER KINDS OF HOUSES MATERIALS IN THEM. AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT -- WHEN YOU'VE GOT A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF LOSSES LIKE THAT IT'S A VERY LEVEL OF SOME PEOPLE ARE UNDER SURE SOME PEOPLE ARE NOT INSURED -- AND ULTIMATELY IT IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY FOR THE STATE. TO COME IN AND OF WORK TO REMOVE FIRST OF ALL -- IDENTIFY ALL THE HOUSEHOLD HAZARDOUS WASTE PAINS PASSED THE SIDES -- ALL OF THOSE THINGS THAT ARE YOU KNOW PROPANE. AND GET THOSE OFF OF THE WAY DISPOSE OF THEM APPROPRIATELY AND THEN COME IN -- AND AND BEGIN THE PROCESS OF DOING THE DEBRIS REMOVAL ULTIMATELY THOUGH I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT EACH AND EVERY INDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNER WATCH WE START -- THAT FACE TO OF DEBRIS REMOVAL UP TO THE HOMEOWNER THEMSELVES AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THE THEY WANTED A STEP INTO THE GOVERNMENT PROGRAM OR NOT. 99% A TIME THEY THEY ALL DO BECAUSE IT IS -- IT IS THE MOST EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE WAY OF DOING IT -- IF THERE ARE INSURANCE PROCEEDS THAT -- ARE NOT TIED TO YOU TO THAT INDIVIDUALS INSURANCE -- PACKAGE THAT CALLS FOR DEBRIS. WHEN WE MAKE THIS CLEAR TO THEM AND THEY FIND THE RIGHT OF ENTRY FORM WHILE WE WORK WITH THE COUNTY TO GO IN AND PULL BACK THOSE? THOSE SECTIONS OF THE INSURANCE PROCEEDS THAT ARE DESIGNATED FOR DEBRIS CLARENCE TO REIMBURSE THE GOVERNMENT. SO ULTIMATELY IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S ABOUT REALLY HEALTH AND SAFETY THE SECOND PIECE IS ECONOMIC RECOVERY THE SOONER WE CAN GET -- THESE COMMUNITIES CLEARED OF A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF FIRE DEBRIS THE SOONER THAT COMMUNITY CAN GET BACK UP ONLINE. REBUILDING CAN START TAX BASE CAN START TO BE GENERATED AND THAT BACK COMMUNITY CAN CAN MOVE FORWARD. OFFICE POINT TO US IS THE CINEMA COUNTY AND AND JUST ABOUT A YEAR AFTER THE 5% REBUILT. AND THAT IS REALLY BECAUSE WE RAPIDLY WHEN AND WERE ABLE TO MOVE OUT WE KNOW HISTORICALLY THAT IF LEFT UP TO EACH AND EVERY PERFECTLY THAT SIZE OF A DISASTER. THAT THAT WE WOULD SIT THERE FOR YEARS BEFORE IT GETS THEN IT GOES TO THE COUNTY HAS TO GET INTO ABATEMENT PROGRAM ULTIMATELY IT BECOMES ANOTHER FINANCIAL BURDEN FOR THE COUNTY. THEREBY EXASPERATING THE INABILITY TO DO GOOD ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND GET BACK GOING AGAIN. SO AND ME TO SAY THAT THAT AT ANY TIME DEPENDS ON ON THE COUNTIES EACH COUNCIL DIFFERENT. IN THE CASE OF SANTA'S SAN DIEGO LAST YEAR DURING DURING THE THE I THINK WAS THE WEST FIRE. THE COUNTY HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO ALSO STEP IN AND DO THE DEBRIS AND WE WORK WITH US ON SOME COST REIMBURSEMENT THINGS SO IF THE COUNTY HAS THE ABILITY AND MANY COUNTIES LIKE TO DO THAT IF IT'S A MANAGEABLE SIZE DISASTER. BUT WE'RE SEEING THE CHI DISASTERS WE'VE BEEN SEEING THEM IT REALLY IS A A VERY MASSIVE FILES SORT OF RECOVERY. AND I'M JUST TRYING TO BE CLINICAL ABOUT IT NOT AND UNEMOTIONAL BECAUSE CERTAINLY NEEDS TO BE DONE. THE THE ISSUE IS. WE'RE STILL BUILDING. AND WILDFIRES OWNS AND I HAVE THE MY COUNTY. LAGUNA BEACH CERTAINLY HAD A MASSIVE CONFLAGRATION IN NINETY THREE FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE HOMES AND WE SEE IT SANTA BARBARA MONTECITO -- OAKLAND HILLS AND IT'S SO. I'M JUST SITTING HERE OKAY WE DID LEARN SOME THINGS OVER THE YEARS LIKE DON'T YOU SHAKE GROUPS ANYMORE -- BUT I IS THERE. IS THERE -- AYE AYE DIFFERENTIAL AND I I APOLOGIZE FOR A LOOKING AT THIS. IN IN HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE POLICY RATES BETWEEN UP WILDFIRES OWN HOMEOWNER AND DIFFERENTIAL BE REFLECTED. THERE'S DEFINITELY ACOSTA FOR ANGEL IF YOU'RE LIVING IN THE WHAT WE AND AND I'M AS I'M TOLD THEM. YOU KNOW BUT THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER A POPPY TALKED AND TALKED TO THEM BUT TO GIVE YOU BETTER FIDELITY ON THIS BUT THE THE REALITY IS IS THAT -- INSURANCE RATES IN THE IN THE WALL THEM BERMAN AND INTERFACE IN THOSE HIGH INTENSITY ZONES -- HAVE GONE UP -- AND IDEAS IS THAT -- YOU KNOW -- INSURANCE ALL OF COURSE IS THE FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE FOR FOR ANY KIND OF DISASTER INDIVIDUALLY SHOULD PROTECT YOUR INVESTMENTS BY HAVING GOOD INSURANCE AND NOT YOU KNOW THE GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS ARE. ARE NOT A MAKE YOUR WHOLE PROGRAM THERE STRICTLY -- BUT THE REALITY IS IS THAT THOSE INSURANCE RATES ARE HIGHER IN THOSE AREAS LET ME ALSO STATE THAT -- THAT THE BUILDING CODES THAT WE DID THAT WE CALIFORNIA HOUSE FOR FOR CONSTRUCTION IN THE WHILE IN URBAN -- INTERFACE ARE THE MOST STRINGENT. CODES -- IN THE WORLD AND THAT KIND OF THING THAT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE CAN'T AND SHOULDN'T AND WON'T. DO MORE IN THAT AREA WHICH WHICH WE'VE BEEN WHICH WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT AND AND LOOKING AT TRYING TO FIND. OTHER PROGRAMS IN OTHER WAYS TO INCREASE THAT RESILIENCY CAPABILITY ALONG IT'S MORE THAN JUST DEFENSIBLE SPACE CLEARING IT IS REALLY WHAT IS YOUR STRUCTURE LOOK LIKE. AND MAYBE THAT'S THROUGH -- INCENTIVES TO DO RETROFITTING FOR HOMEOWNERS WORKING MORE WITH THE ENSURE I'D LIKE TO SEE THE INSURANCE COMPANIES QUITE FRANKLY COME TO THE TABLE MORE AND COME UP WITH WITH. TAKING SOME INTEREST MONEY THAT YOU'RE MAKING AND PUTTING IT INTO A MITIGATION PROGRAM THAT COULD. COULD COULD MATCH -- MAYBE MATCH THAT WHAT WE'RE LOCAL GOVERNMENT CAN'T MATCH -- WITH STATE DOLLARS OR OR DO A PROGRAM A GRANT TO THE HOMEOWNER AND IF THE HOMEOWNER DOES IT. THEN BRING DOWN THEIR INSURANCE PREMIUMS MAYBE 20% -- OR SO -- UP THERE OF A OF A OF THE BENEFIT BECAUSE THEY HAVE DONE SOMETHING POSITIVE TO BUY DOWN THE RISK OF THE OF THE DISASTER WE'VE DONE THIS IN THE EARTHQUAKE AREA AND IS PROVING TO BE. PRETTY POSITIVE AND I I THINK THAT'S AN AREA WE NEED. TO GET THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY LIMIT MORTGAGE WITH. THANK YOU ASK THE BASIC QUESTION AND YOU EXCEEDED EXPECTATIONS YOU COVERED. ACTUALLY WHERE I SORT OF WANTED MY MOM WOULD BE HAPPY. TO TALK. WELL ALL THROUGH MY SCHOOL YEARS THAT WAS NOT THE CASE. WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH THE HOW TO BALANCE A LOT OF THINGS WE HAVE -- WE'RE NOT TALKING P. JEANNIE BUT WHAT WE DO ABOUT [inaudible] THIS. UTILITY WHAT WE DO ABOUT INSURANCE. ISSUERS AND AND AND WE'VE GOT A LOT OF THINGS THAT ARE. THERE THAT HAVE TO SOMEHOW BE STAYING IN BALANCE AND SO I LIKE THE IDEA OF INCENTIVIZING A HOMEOWNER DO SOMETHING WHETHER TO DIFFERENT SPRINKLER SYSTEM OR WHATEVER. IT MAY BE ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE HOME -- SO I'M BUT WE'RE JUST LOOKING IDEAS I APPRECIATE YOUR RESPONSE MY LAST QUESTION IS WITH REGARDS -- TO RED FLAG DAYS -- WE HAVE OUR CONDITIONS YOU YOU MENTION THOSE VISIT AND WHEN WE HAVE ZERO HUMIDITY ORANGE COUNTY I THINK WE PUT OUR HELICOPTERS UP WHICH ARE LOOKING. YOU KNOW AND AND START MONITORING RIGHT AWAY BUT EVEN THAT DOESN'T HELP EVEN WITH THE WITH THE SPEED OF THE WIND THINGS CISCO SO SO QUICKLY -- TALKING TO ONE OF THE UTILITIES THIS WEEK THEY ACTUALLY HIRED A METEOROLOGIST TO TO DO THE WEATHER -- AND SO I'M JUST WONDERING DOES IT DOES -- YES FOLLOW THE SAME APPROACH OR DO YOU JUST RELY ON THE FEDERAL WEATHER SERVICE WELL I I I MADE BY NIGHT KIND OF GLOSSED OVER THAT. YOU KNOW I SAID NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE WE WE ACTUALLY HAVE UP OF RELATIVELY WE I SAY WE CAL FIRE AND WORKING WITH US AND AND AND OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. HAVE. A LEVEL OF CAPACITY WE HAVE FIRE FORECASTERS WITHIN OUR OPERATION CENTERS -- NORTH AND SOUTH -- WE WHEN WE HAVE A FIRE READING INDEX THAT THAT GIVES AS GIVES US -- A LOT A LOT THAT HELPS AT SOME LEVEL YOU'RE IN THAT AND SO I IN ORDER HELICOPTERS GO FOR FIRE STARTS -- BUT WE'RE NOT WHERE WE NEED TO BE CENTER WE WE WE WE NEED WE NEED TO HAVE BETTER YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S BEEN DONE LIKE THIS. FOR SEVERAL YEARS WE NEED TO GO TO THE NEXT LEVEL WE NEED TO BECOME MORE SOPHISTICATED. USE TECHNOLOGY SO WE'RE ALL SEEING IT IN A REAL TIME WAY THAT TECHNOLOGY THOSE MICHAEL CLIMATE STATIONS -- YOU KNOW THE GOVERNOR IN HIS BUDGET HAS -- HAS -- PROPOSE SOME SOME MICRO CLIMATE STATIONS IN CAMERA SYSTEMS -- THAT THAT'S THE KIND OF TECHNOLOGY WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO PUSH OUT THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND THEN AND THEN ALL THAT NEEDS TO BE COMING INTO A PLACE WHERE YOU HAVE ANALYSTS. THAT ARE -- THAT ARE EVALUATING IT AND AND CONNECTING THE DOTS AS TO WITH THESE ARE GOING TO BE THE AREAS OF OF MOST CONCERN AND THAT WE NEED TO ACT ACCORDINGLY SO WE WE DO HAVE CAPABILITY AND AND WE'VE BEEN USING IT OUT TO THE TO THE TO THE DATE THIS. IS HOW WE'RE DOING IT BUT I'LL TELL YOU THAT THERE IS DEFINITELY MORE THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. THANK YOU MISTER GIRDLE CHI ARE REALLY APPRECIATE RESPONSES AND MISTER SMITH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- AND I WON THE ECHO MY MY COLLEAGUES -- COMMENDATION. THERE TO GIVE THE DG YOU KNOW YOU'VE BEEN JUST ON THE SPOT IN THE TOUGHEST SPOTS THERE ARE IN THE WHOLE STATE AND SEEING SOME REAL HUMAN TRAGEDY OF THESE LAST FEW YEARS AND HERE TO YOU AND YOUR STAFF AND AND ALL THAT ARE WORKING STAFF CAL RECYCLING THROUGHOUT. THE COORDINATING AGENCIES WE APPRECIATE IT YOU KNOW GOVERNMENT. WE DON'T NOTICES UNTIL IT REALLY MATTERS. AND IT REALLY MATTERS RIGHT NOW SO -- YOU KNOW MY MY INITIAL QUESTION JUST A VERY SIMPLE HIGH LEVEL ONE WHICH IS HOW. HOW DO YOU DEFINE? PREPAREDNESS WAR READINESS YET. HAD HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU DEFINE IF WE'RE READY. THAT IS A SIMPLE QUESTION WITH A VERY. COMPLICATED ANSWER -- CALIFORNIA A IS EXTREMELY -- UNIQUE IN MANY WAYS -- YOU KNOW. WHERE WE AND WE ASK YOU KNOW WE WE HAVE TO WE TALK ABOUT REASONS? APPEARED AS WE LOOK AT LEVELS OF RESILIENCY WERE AT ALL HAZARDS STATE SO YOU KNOW HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU FIND A COMMON PLACE -- WHERE WE HAVE UP LEVELS LEVELS OF OF -- OF PREPAREDNESS AND WHEN I SAY ALL HOUSE WITH THAT MEANS THAT IT'S NOT JUST WALL VIRUS EARTHQUAKE FIRE FLOOD AND AND AND OTHER KINDS OF THREATS -- WE'VE GOT. IN. ONE SENSE OF THE WORD LA COUNTY THE LARGEST COUNTY IN THE STATE WITH. WHAT IS EIGHTY MILLION PEOPLE SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND ALPINE COUNTY THE SMALLEST COUNTY IN THE STATE WITH JUST A FEW HUNDRED PEOPLE RIGHT? OUR ROLE IS TO TRY TO BALANCE OFF THE CAPABILITY THE ABILITY FOR THOSE COMMUNITIES TO BUILD SOME LEVEL OF CAPACITY WE'VE GOT EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN. A FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES FIFTY EIGHT DIFFERENT CULTURES FIFTY EIGHT DIFFERENT WAYS OF LOOKING AT BUSINESS RIGHT. SO -- WE NO AND IT COMES IN DIFFERENT FORMS IT'S NOT JUST THE GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS HAS TO BE A WHOLE OF COMMUNITY APPROACH SO IT'S THE IT'S THE PUBLIC. BATH TAKE RESPONSIBILITY. I SAID THERE'S SOMETHING I CALL THE NINE ONE ONE SYNDROME PEOPLE USED TO DIAL 911- AND GET EVERYTHING COMING THEY DON'T REALLY. SOME MIGHT THING TO WORRY ABOUT I JUST DAHLE I'M A ONE THE FIRE DEPARTMENT COMES BUT IN DISASTER. AS WE SEEN. WHEN YOU DIAL 911- YOU MAY NOT GET THOSE FIREFIGHTERS RIGHT AWAY? THEY MAY NOT COME FOR A FEW HOURS OR MAYBE A DAY BECAUSE WE'RE IN A STATEWIDE RED FLY CONDITION AND WE'VE GOT. A MAJOR CATASTROPHE IN THE NORTH PULLING RESOURCES IN A MAJOR CATASTROPHE THE SOUTH FULLY RESOURCES. MUCH MOST OF THE STATION SEVEN BROWNED OUT. AND AND THERE'S JUST A WERE RESOURCES IMMEDIATELY. SO PART OF PREPAREDNESS. HIS FIRST IN WORKING TO GET INDIVIDUALS ENGAGED IN BUILDING EMPOWERING THEMSELVES AND BUILDING A CAPABILITY THE SECOND THING IS THEN WORKING WITH OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS -- TO TO UNDERSTAND THAT EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT IT IT'S IT'S A COMPLEX BUSINESS AND IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT. RESPONDING AT PUTTING THE WET STUFF ON THE REST OF IT IS. IT IS IS PRE EVENT MITIGATION. THE ABILITY TO PREPARE THE COMMUNITY AND HARDEN IT. TO DO GOOD ANALYSIS OF OF THE THREATS THAT THEY FACE FIRST WHAT THE RECOGNIZED THE THREATS. AND THEN AND THEN PUT MITIGATION EFFORTS IN AND THAT MEANS LEVERAGING EVERY MEDICATION DOLLARS THAT MEANS OUR LOCAL. ELECTED BODIES NEED TO PRIORITIZE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AND MEDICATION AS A AS A P. A FACTOR AND IT ALSO GOES DOWN INTO OUR LOCAL PLANNING COMMISSIONS WHICH WHICH AS THEY BUILD OUT COMMUNITIES. THEY HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT WHAT IF IS THAT COMMUNITY RESILIENT ENOUGH TO A DISASTER OKAY AND THEN FROM THAT. BUILDING IN ENOUGH CAPACITY OF AFTER YEARS OF OF DOWNTURN IN ECONOMICS EXCEPT FOR A WHILE WE STILL HAVE FIRE DEPARTMENTS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY ENTITIES. THAT HAVE NOT COME UP TO FULL SPEED YET AND HAVE RESOURCE ISSUES RIGHT -- BUT IT'S NOT JUST THERE WE HAVE EMERGENCY MANAGERS IT'S ALL OVER THE MAP IN CALIFORNIA SUMMER LOCATED BURIED IN THE DEPARTMENT OF HAVE ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES SUMMER IN THE CEO'S OFFICE IT'S IT RUNS THE GAMUT -- AND SO WE NEED TO RAISE THE STATURE OF THAT ROLE SO THAT THAT THAT INDIVIDUAL -- CAN ACTUALLY HELP THE COMMUNITY RECOGNIZED THE THREATS BEYOND THE TRADITIONAL FIRE IN AND LAW ENFORCEMENT. CAN I JUMP IN JAIL JUST TO HELP SORRY I THOUGHT IT WAS A COMPLICATED ANSWER IT. WAS SO THE DEPARTMENT DEFENSE DEFINES ME READING IS FOR THEMSELVES THE ABILITY IT DEPENDING ON THE ADMINISTRATION. THE SORT OF TWO AND A HALF FOR ONE AND A HALF STRATEGY TO MAJOR -- WARS AT THE SAME TIME AS WELL AS THREE SMALL ARMED CONFLICTS IS SORT OF THE STANDARD WORKING DEFINITION OF RATING IS TO DEPARTMENT DEFENSE DO YOU GET TO THAT SORT OF QUANTITATIVE. THINKING I I I GET THE SORT OF THE THE HOLISTIC THINKING BUT WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT IS IF THERE'S SACRAMENTO COUNTY IN A SANTA CRUZ COUNTY I HAVE THREE MAJOR -- MAJOR FIRE DISASTERSAT THE SAME TIME -- YOU KNOW WITH YOU ANALYZE THOSE COUNTIES RESOURCES LIKE TO DO WE HAVE THE I MEAN THE USER DEFINED IN LIKE IF WE HAVE FOUR TO TIME AND TWO SMALL ARE WE READY WITH AN EARTHQUAKE ON TOP LIKE HOW HOW DO YOU SORT OF DO THAT SIMPLE. SNOT SIMPLE MATH SO THAT'S THAT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN I WHEN I THOUGHT YOU'RE ASKING YEAH OVERALL BUT YEAH YEAH SO YOUR TALK ABOUT READING THIS AND WHAT WE OF THE STATE THE STATE YEAH AND AND IN A COMBINED WHEN I GO TO THERE'S A LOCAL RULE BUT SORT. OF DOING THE OVERALL MATH HERE ON WHAT. WE DO DO WE DO HAVE A VERY SIMILAR -- CONSTRUCT WHERE WE CAN WE HAVE TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO MANAGE AT LEAST TO WHAT WE CALL LEVEL -- ONE THOSE ARE CATASTROPHIC EVENTS SIMULTANEOUSLY IN THE STATE AND ALL AND THEN A LEVEL -- TO AND SO YOU HAVE GOT TO LEVEL ONE LEVEL TWO AND LEVEL TWO IS JUST YOU KNOW IT'S NOT NECESSARILY. FOR THE CUTS A BAD DAY BUT IT'S IT'S NOT CATASTROPHIC AND AND THAT IS. IT WHEN I SEE THAT IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE ALL HANDS ON TRAINING TO TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN EFFECTIVELY. DO THAT THE THAT THAT'S THE GENERAL -- CONDO. WE'RE WOLSEY IN CAMP BOTH LEVEL ONES YES SO DURING THAT THAT INCIDENT WHO WHO AND WE AND EIGHT ON THE HEELS OF CAR AND MODESTY THOUGH -- SORT OF LEADING IN BEING STRETCHED THIN WE WEREN'T PRE POSITIONED IN WILL SEE RIGHT BACK THERE WAS NO PRE POSITIONING WE WEREN'T ON THE SEASONAL ROTATION MINUSES THAT THAT SHIFTED NOW IN TERMS OF POLICY THAT'S SORT OF WHAT CENTER MCGUIRE WAS GETTING AT TERMS OF REFORMS TO THE PRE. POSITIONING PLAN WHICH I APPRECIATE -- BUT WHEN YOU KNOW WE HAD BIG TOWN HALL JUST LAST WEEKEND WITH LA COUNTY FIRE WITH ABOUT A THOUSAND VERY UPSET RESIDENCE WHEN THEY SAY YOU KNOW WE ASK FOR SEVENTY TRUCKS. YOUR YOUR HUNKER DOWN IT CAN'T. VENTURA COUNTY IS UP IT HILL. DO IN THEIR THING AND THE RESPONSE BACK WAS WITH IT. WE DON'T HAVE IT. AND SO. THEY WERE SEVENTY ENGINES AND THEY THEY DIDN'T GET THERE AND THEN YOU KNOW THINGS HAPPEN -- AND SO I JUST SORT OF GET BOTH THE GRANULAR NEAR TERM THIS YEAR BUDGETARY STRATEGY IN TERMS OF HOW TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE READY REALLY GETTING DOWN TO BRASS TACKS ON WHAT THAT QUANTIFIED. WHAT THAT MEANS -- AND THEN I I WON THE LA WAS COMMENTARY ON THIS MULTI YEAR -- QUESTION CENTER MONEY I THINK YOU BROUGHT IT UP NICELY WHICH IS -- WHAT WOULD YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN THROUGH SO WE GOT ALMOST A BILLION DOLLAR TAB IF THE FEDS ARE GENEROUS ENOUGH TO KEEP HELP IN FOR THAT EIGHTEEN NINETEEN COSTS BUT? YOU KNOW YOU GO BACK IN TIME. AND IT JUST IT IT KEEPS RAMPING BUT YOU KNOW WE SORT OF DO THE E. FINDER WE DO THE SFE WE SORT OF QUICK INFUSIONS OF CAPITAL BUT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. MULTI BILLION DOLLAR LIABILITIES THAT CAN KIND OF POP OUT OF NO WHERE SO JUST FROM A SCHOOL READINESS I GUESS -- FISCAL PREPAREDNESS HOW HOW DO WE SHOULD APPROACH A MULTI YOUR STRATEGY INTELLIGENTLY SO THAT WE'RE NOT. CAUGHT FLAT FOOTED IN THAT FOR ALL THESE OTHER CRUCIAL PRIORITIES WE'VE GOTTEN THE BUDGET THING CARE PEOPLE'S HEALTH CARE MAKING SURE KIDS AND GET TO SCHOOL YOU KNOW LIKE ALL ALL THE CRUCIAL FUNCTION OF NORMAL DAILY LIFE. HOW DO WE NOT SWALLOW UP THOSE OF HER OTHER PRIORITIES HERE AND BE A LITTLE MORE SYSTEMATIC ABOUT THE OVERALL NUMBER I'M JUST? MAYBE INGO IN JUMP IN THAT I LA -- I MEAN YOU HAVE A THOUGHT ON THAT. ONE TOP PROVIDE SOME INITIAL COMMENTS IN MY COLLEAGUES AS COMPUTERS IT'S IT'S HERE ALSO AND SHE CAN PROVIDE SOME COMMENTS ON THAT. HELLFIRE SIDE -- BUT IN TERMS SAID THAT THE STATE'S BUDGETARY READY DAYS -- WE DO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT RESERVE FIND WHICH THE LEGISLATURE HAS I'M TAKING QUITE A BIT OF ACTION TO REALLY -- REALLY PROVIDE SOME FUNDING THERE AND BASICALLY WE'VE BEEN USING THAT TO HELP TO HELP US -- ADDRESS SOME OF THESE UNANTICIPATED COSTS AND IT'S BEEN VERY VERY VALUABLE -- IT PROBABLY IS WORTH US THINKING ABOUT YOU KNOW THINGS LIKE HOW MUCH THAT SHOULD BE IF IT'S GOING TO ACTUALLY -- OF COURSE -- SERVICE AS AS BOTH SORT OF A SELF INSURANCE FOR SOME OF THESE MAJOR DISASTERS IN HELPING US THAT WE NEED TO IS CASH FLOW NEEDS AS WELL AS BUDGETARY RESILIENCE OF THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF CONVERSATIONS I THINK WE'LL CONTINUE TO HAVE -- BUT THANKFULLY WE'VE BEEN AND ALSO WOULD HAVE GOOD BUDGET SITUATION -- THIS YEAR AND LAST YEAR AND AND THAT'S BEEN VERY HELPFUL IN IN ALLOWING US TO MAKE THESE KINDS OF EXPENDITURE SO I THINK IT'S A CONTINUING CONVERSATION -- WE DON'T HAVE LIKE A RAINY DAY FUND IN THE SAME WAY FOR THIS WE SORT OF SET ASIDE OUT OF OTHER RESERVES TO GET READY BUT IF THE BUDGET TAKES A TURN AND WE'RE NOT LOOKING THAT GOOD IN TO OR THREE YEARS BUT THE FIRES ACTUALLY GET WORSE THAN. WHAT HAPPENED? EXACTLY RIGHT SO WE DON'T HAVE A DESIGNATED RESERVE IT'S JUST FOR DISASTERS INSTEAD WE WERE USING OUR OUR SIR GENERAL RESERVE FUND -- TO HELP US ADDRESS SOME OF THESE FISCAL CHALLENGES WE HAVE HAD DISASTERS -- SO I THINK IT IS WORTH HAVING A CONVERSATION ABOUT -- HOW HOW WHAT WE WANT THOSE RESERVE LEVELS TO BE TO INSURE THAT WE CAN HAVE IT MEET THOSE NEEDS AS WELL AS OTHER THINGS AND CERTAINLY? YOU KNOW WE MAY NOT WANT TO DRIVE DOWN THAT RESERVE FOLEY -- BECAUSE IN YOUR EVEN WHEN WE HAVE A AND ECONOMIC KIND OF STRESS IN OUR IN OUR STATE BECAUSE WE WANT. TO YOU TO THINK THAT WE HAVE THE SYSTEM WE DO WILL PROBABLY WANT TO HAVE SOME CUSHION THERE -- FOR THE EVENT THAT WE HAVE SOME MAJOR DISASTER COSTS I'M SO I THINK THOSE ARE CUT CONVERSATION THEIR OFFICE WOULD BE VERY INTERESTED IN CONTINUING TO HAVE. A WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND I'M CERTAINLY VERY. I'M JUST IN TERMS OF FIRE ANALYSTS ARE FAVORITE TO LOOK OVER YOUR SHOULDER ALL AREA. BUT IT AND SO I AM I WOULD ALSO KNOW IN TERMS OF THE FINANCIAL-READING IS THAT AND THE BUDGET -- DOES INCLUDE A HIGHER AND NOW I'VE SORT OF BE SLAIN BUDGETED AMOUNT FOR THAT YOU FIND -- AND THAT'S JUST A FUNCTION OF LOOKING AT HOW THAT YOU FIND COSTS HAVE BEEN GROWING IN RECENT YEARS AND SO THERE IS SOME -- PLANNING AHEAD FOR POTENTIALLY HIGHER -- COSTS ON THE FIRE RESPONSE SIDE ON IN TERMS OF THE MULTI YEAR WE CAN TALK ABOUT THIS A LITTLE BIT MORE ON THE NEXT PANEL BUT I THINK IT GETS TO THE HEART OF SOME YOUR QUESTION SENATOR STERN HAVE -- LOOKING OUT WAIT WHAT IS THE IDEAL LEVEL OF READINESS OR RESPONSE AND PREPAREDNESS AND AND SO -- WE CAN TALK ABOUT IT MORE BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU MAY WANT TO THINK ABOUT WHEN YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT THIS WHOLE PACKAGE OF HOW DO WE RESPOND TO WILDFIRES AND DISASTERS IS -- EIGHTEEN THE ADMINISTRATION HASN'T PUT FORWARD AN ASSESSMENT RECENTLY OF WHAT THE CAPACITY IS OF STATE AND LOCAL SYSTEMS COMBINED ON IF THERE'S ANY GAPS AND SAID YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT AUGMENTING RESOURCES ADDING FIRE ENGINES ADDING. AN AIR RESOURCES I YOU MAY WANT TO HAVE MORE OF AN ASSESSMENT LIKE THAT BECAUSE THIS IS VERY LIKELY NOT GOING TO BE A ONE YEAR -- THING OF INCREASING RESOURCES WE'VE DONE IN RECENT YEARS IT'S VERY LIKELY TO CONTINUE THAT TREND IN FUTURE YEARS AS WE HAVE THESE VERY AS SEVERE FIRE SEASONS AND SO. I YOU MAY WANT TO THINK MORE ABOUT IT A MULTI YOUR STRATEGY WE CAN TALK MORE ABOUT THE NEXT. OKAY THANKS CAN I JUST SAY ONE THING PLEASE ARE SO. KEEP IN MIND THAT OVER THE COURSE OF GOVERNOR BROWN'S MYSTERY IT'S IN THE OVER ARCHING PREPAREDNESS LEVEL RIGHT YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S TECHNOLOGY WHETHER IT'S MEETING WE HAVE WE FINALLY MET THE LAST YEAR THE BLUE RIBBON. FIRE COMMISSION RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE NUMBER OF OF WE ASK ENGINES THAT NEEDED TO BE PUT IN THE SYSTEM THAT'S A AUGMENTING FORCE THAT IS BE A ABOVE AND BEYOND THE EXISTING AND WE ARE NOW MEETING THAT. THAT IS THAT THE NEXT STEP IS TO GO BACK AND RE EVALUATE IS THAT GIVEN THE CURRENT THREAT WE CONSTANTLY HAVE TO BE LOOKING AT THE NEXT STEP. BUT I THINK THE USE OF TECHNOLOGY -- BETTERTO HELP BY DOWN THE RISK -- BECAUSE WE KNOW WE'LL TAKE IT TAKE A PAGE OUT A HOMELAND SECURITY -- YOU CAN YOU CAN SPEND BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON ON RESOURCES AND ARE STILL GOING TO BE A SECURITY THREAT SO. IT'S ALL IN HOW YOU BEST UTILIZE THAT TO TO MOVE US FORWARD I THINK THERE'S SOME DIFFERENT AREAS WE CAN AND I AND I LOVE THAT FRAME BECAUSE IT. I TO GETTING THAT MATH TIGHT FOR US ON BUDGET COMMITTEE SO WE CAN ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND OKAY WE'RE MAKING A BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT BUT ACTUALLY GET ME JUST LIKE WE DO ON FIND OUT PENSION LIABILITIES ARE DEBTS RIGHT YOU'RE ACTUALLY. YOU'RE SPENDING MONEY TO SAVE MONEY RIGHT THIS WORKS ON INFRASTRUCTURE IT HAPPENS AND HEALTHCARE SORT OF LOOKING AT THOSE ARE LONG TERM OUTCOME FOR RIGHT NOW IT FEELS. A LITTLE BIT LIKE. BUT WE'RE NOT QUANTIFYING THE PROGRESS WE'RE MAKING EVEN LIKE WE'RE NOT ABLE TO CAPTURE THOSE METRICS ACCURATELY IN A WAY I KNOW IT'S A ROUGH SCIENCE HERE WE'RE NEVER GONNA GET TO A POINT WHERE LIKE PERFECTLY QUANTIFIED OF EXACTLY WHAT IS. RATING IS MEAN OR EXACTLY HOW MUCH RISK AND WE BOUGHT DOWN AND WILDFIRES ARE INHERENTLY CHAOTIC THAT'S WHAT NATURAL DISASTERS ARE RIGHT THERE UNPREDICTABLE AND SOMEWHAT ACTS OF GOD OR THE WERE CONTRIBUTING TO IT NOW GIVEN OUR FOSSIL FUEL PATTERNS BUT YEAH. LET'S LET'S START TIGHTER SO WHEN. HOW MUCH RISK ARE WE BUYING DOWN RIGHT WHAT COST SAVINGS ARE WE GENERATING FOR THE STATE WITH? EITHER HOME HARDENING A SMARTER INSURANCE POSTURE GETTING MORE LOCAL COORDINATION SOME OF THESE SUBPOENAS TO ADVANCE SUPPRESSION EFFORTS PRESCRIBED BURNS RIGHT CERTAIN THAT THEY ALL SORT OF FEED TO A CENTRAL MATH THAT HELPS US. REALLY UNDERSTAND HOW WELL WE'RE DOING EVEN THINGS LIKE GREED GREED MANAGEMENT -- SETTING ASIDE THE SORT OF RESTRUCTURING QUESTION PENDING UP UP NORTH OF PGA ANY YOU KNOW. IF IF THESE COMMUNITIES WERE MORE SELF POWERED AND WE ACTUALLY COULD SHUT OFF POWER WITHOUT THE LIGHTS GOING OFF ON THE CENTRAL GREED ON THOSE HIGH FIRE DAYS ANDYOU HAD. FIRE STATIONS AND HOSPITALS IN AND CRITICAL RESOURCE EVEN CRITICALLY POSITION COMMUNITIES ABLE TO SUSTAIN WITHOUT GRID BASED POWER AND HAVE SOLAR AND BATTERY IN MY CREW GREAT SYSTEMS LIKE OKAY THAT'S EXPENSIVE. BUT HOW MUCH RISK ARE YOU SAVING THEN ON THE BACK AND FROM ALL THE OTHER BILLIONS WE SPENT. AND SORT OF TRYING TO BUILD THAT SYSTEM ANYWAY I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ON THAT AND REALLY APPRECIATE ALEJO'S HELP GOING FORWARD. TO AND THANK YOU FOR THAT YET GIVE ME A MOMENT TO GET INTO WE CAN TALK ON THE NEXT PANEL AND THEN. FINALLY ON ON MISTER SMITH LINES -- SIDE -- JUST WANT TO BRIEFLY THANK YOU AND YES WE CAN THE IMPORTANT OPTING IN RIGHT OF ENTRY AND REALLY GETTING THAT DONE -- IN THESE COMMUTING GETTING THE WORD OUT THAT IT'S A COST SAVER FOR THE HOMEOWNER -- YOU KNOW YOU CAN COME IN AND DO THAT INSPECTION AND IT IS TRUE THAT YOU CAN ALSO CHANGE YOUR MIND AT THAT AFTER THAT SO IF YOU DECIDE THAT YOUR INSURANCE KICKS IN. AND YOU'RE READY TO YOU KNOW GO TO YOUR YOUR PRIVATE PLANNING SURE TO WANT. TO RETAILER NON COUNTY OR NON STATE SOLUTION YOU CAN DO THAT RIGHT YOU CAN OPT IN. TO THE R. O. E. AND THEN YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR MIND LATER. WOULD YOU SAY THE MOST BILL SHOULD JUST BE OPTING IN RIGHT NOW AND JUST GET IN THE SYSTEM AND THERE'S A NUMBER OF EFFICIENCIES WE GAIN BY THE MAJORITY OR EVERYBODY OPTING IN -- JUST ACROSS THE ENTIRE PROCESS -- YOU KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TENS OR EVEN SOMETIMES HUNDREDS OF CREWS WORKING IN THE COMMUNITY SO WE'RE WORKING WITH A HOPSCOTCH OF PROPERTY SOME THAT ARE IN AND OTHERS THAT AREN'T IT IMPACTS OUR EFFICIENCY JUST FRANKLY. MUCH ABOUT THERE'S VERY DIFFICULT TO TO LEAVE A LEAVE A COMMUNITY WITH ROPERTIES THAT ARE CLEANED UP I MEAN YOU'RE LOOKING AT PILES OF ACTION YOU KNOW THERE'S THAT MATERIALS NOT SAFE. RIGHT IN WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS LEAVE THOSE COMMUNITIES CLEAN AND SAFE READY TO REBUILD -- SO FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS THAT THAT'S THE WAY TO GO AND WE WORK WITH -- YESTERDAY AND THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO COMMUNICATE THAT GREAT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MEASURE. I'M GOING TO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS AND EACH SECTION I'M GONNA TRY TO TAILOR MY QUESTIONS INTO THE PURPOSE OF THIS. SECTION. DOES THE FIRST A COUPLE OF OBSERVATIONS. SOMETIMES WE GET PRETTY DISGUSTED ABOUT SOCIETY. ONE OF THE VERY INTERESTING THINGS TO ME AND I LOOK AT YOUR MAP THERE THE OUT OF STATE RESOURCES. DURING THE FIRE PARTICULARLY WHEN IT WAS RAGING. BEING UP THERE ON SITE. ONE OF THE THINGS IT WAS INSTRUCTIVE TO ME THE AMOUNT OF COMMENTS FROM OUT OF STATE RESPONDERS WHO SAID THAT THEY'VE BEEN RESPONDING ALL OVER AMERICA KATRINA YOU NAME IT. TO EMERGENCIES THEY SAID WE HAVE NEVER SEEN THE OUTPOURING OF SUPPORT. FOR A COMMUNITY THAT WE'RE SEEING HERE. AND THAT WAS MANIFESTED IN MANY WAYS. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT GIVES US A LITTLE BIT OF HOPE. ANOTHER OBSERVATION WHICH WILL APPLY TO OTHER SECTIONS OF THIS AS WELL AND THAT IS MANAGING THE FORCE IN THE WILD PLANTS. POST FIRE. AS ONE UP THERE THE FIRST THING THAT REALLY STRUCK ME. WAS A LARGE TREES. SCORCHED BUT THE LORD BARK. MAYBE TWELVE FEET UP MAYBE LESS. BUT THE CANOPIES LARGELY UNTOUCHED. NINE FORESTER BY THE HAD TO BE A PRODUCT OF PARTLY THE AMOUNT OF ACCUMULATED FUEL. AVAILABLE TO THE FIRE THE WINDS. AND THEN THE CANYONS. THE CHANNEL THOSE. THAT WAS THE ONLY GOOD THING THAT I SAW OF THAT. IS THE CHARACTER OF THAT RICH AND IT'S NOT JUST PARADISE THE CITY YOU'VE GOT AT THE RICH IS FOR I REFER. TO WHAT HAS BEEN SUCH A VALUE TO THEM A STATICALLY WORE THOSE GREAT TREES. AND I'M HOPEFUL BASED ON WHAT I'VE SEEN LITTLE LOT OF THOSE TALLER TREES. THAT WERE SCORCHED. BUT WON'T BE WE CAN SUCH A DEAL DIE. WITH THE CANOPIES INTACT AND STILL YET HEALTHY AFTER ALL THESE WEEKS IN ANOTHER LITERALLY EVERY WEEK -- THERE'S SOME HOPE THAT THE CHARACTER THAT COMMUNITY. CAN TO THEM TO SOME DEGREE RETURN. OF MISTER SMITH. ONE HOW ARE YOU FEELING YOU WERE PROGRESSING. WITH. THE CLEANUP UP THERE NOW AND I KNOW WE HAVE ONE HERE ISSUE. WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH DIRECTOR GIL OUR DUTY ON ASSEMBLY CAN GALLAGHER NOT ACT COMMUNICATING TO THE CITIZENS OF THE NEED FOR THE RIGHT TO RETREAT -- AND WE'VE GOT A WAYS TO GO THANK YOU FOR EXTENDING THE TIME FOR RESPONSE. BUT HOW DO YOU FEEL IT IN AND WHAT WOULD YOU DESCRIBE THE STATUS RIGHT NOW OF THE CLEAN UP. ROUGHLY ON SCHEDULE -- I WOULD SAY YES ROUGHLY ON SCHEDULE I MEAN I I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT THEY ARE A WE NUMBER. IS POTENTIALLY DISPROPORTIONATELY A LITTLE BIT LOWER. DURING THIS POINT IN THE CLEANUP THAN WE'VE SEEN BUT GENERALLY ONCE WE START -- A PRESENCE IN THE COMMUNITY WHICH WE'RE DOING NOW. WE GENERALLY SEE A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT UPTICK IN THE NUMBER OF ARE WE USE THAT THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WE'VE SEEN -- SO. I DON'T THINK WE'RE ALARMED AT THE NUMBER I THINK IT'S VERY SAY MIGHT BE A LITTLE LOWER DISPROPORTIONATELY NUMBER WE SEEN BUT WE EXPECT TO SEE AN UPTCK NOW THAT ACTIVITIES BEGINNING -- SO -- I DON'T WANT TO SERVE IT WELL WE GET IT DOES AND WE'RE GOING TO COULD. I WAS GOING TO SAY TO THEM THE BILL [inaudible] THE FIRST. MONTH AND A HALF OR SO. REALLY WAS TO GETTING ALL THAT HOUSEHOLD HAZARDOUS WASTE OFF WE ARE NOW COLLECTIVELY COMPLETE FOR AN ALTERED TO PURPOSES AND THAT THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S SEVERAL. THIRTY FORTY THOUSAND PROPERTIES THE GOING TO DO THAT SO THERE WAS A WHOLE BIG EFFORT. BUT TO THE POINT OF OF DIRECTORS MISALIGNED SAM. COMICS THOSE ARE EASY YOU KNOW SENATOR ARE ARE REALLY. ARE REALLY THAT CASE HE'LL AND AND OUR ABILITY TO GET IN AND DO THAT AND AND YOURS AND SOME MEMBER GALLAGHER IS WORKING THIS HAS BEEN. SO INSTRUMENTAL IN HELPING TO GET THAT MOVING FORWARD BECAUSE YOU KNOW ULTIMATELY IF WE DON'T GET IF THOSE DON'T GET CLEANED UP IN THE COUNTY AS YOU KNOW HAS TO DO AN ABATEMENT AND THEN -- PUBLIC ALL COMES BACK DOES AND IN THE END ANYWAY SO IT'S NOT A VERY EFFICIENT WAY OF DOING IT IT IS IT CERTAINLY IS A CHALLENGE AND I WANTED NEVER LOSE AN OPPORTUNITY TO BRING WHOEVER MAY BE WATCHING OUT THERE PLEASE. SIGN UP. A THINK YOU'RE HELPING YOUR NEIGHBORS AS WELL QUESTION RELATED TO THE A CONSIDERATION FOR PRE POSITIONING. IS PART OF THE CONSIDERATION RELATED TO GEOGRAPHY NOW THE REASON I MAKE THIS POINT. THAT RIDGE IS VERY UNIQUE CANYONS. THE VERY CONDUCIVE TO THE WINDS AND THE EXPLOSION FIRE NOT. RIP REPETITIVE THE SPREADING OF THE FIRE IS THE GEOGRAPHY SOMETIMES A CONSIDERATION OR IT CAN BE A CONSIDERATION IN OUR PERFECT PRE POSITIONING. THE TREASURY'S YES IT IS AND AND DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE FOR EXAMPLE -- AN THE LOS ANGELES AREA WE SEE THE SANTA ANA WINDS IN SANTA BARBARA WE SEE THE SUNDOWNERS THAT THE TOPOGRAPHY -- FRAMES HOW THAT WIND EVENT IS GOING TO HAPPEN -- IN THE NORTH WE HAVE THE NORTHERNERS AND AND AND THE NORTH WINDS. AND AND SO -- THE SHORT ANSWER IS YES IT IS TAKING INTO ACCOUNT WITH REGARDS -- TO WHAT ARE THE UNIQUE -- RED FLAG IN THAT PARTICULAR AREA. OKAY. OF MANAGER THAT'S ENOUGH FOR NOW BEEN BE EXCEEDS ALL THESE QUESTIONS IN THE OTHER SECTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- SENATOR NIELSEN AND THANK YOU WE'RE GOING TO TRANSITION OVER TO OUR SECOND PANEL. THERE. WERE WILL FOCUS ON WILDFIRE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE. WE'LL BE JOINED AT THE TABLE BY MATT L. ME. THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE JESSICA PETERS AGAIN WITH THE LA JOH.

WE'LL GET STARTED. WITH MATH. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR -- IN MEMBERS ATT ALL ME DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- BUILDING ON SENATOR MUNNINGS -- COMMENTS FROM EARLIER. CLIMATE CHANGE CONTINUES TO LENGTHEN FIRE SEASON IN CALIFORNIA. OF FOUR CONSECUTIVE YEARS OF CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES HAVE SURPASSED ALL PREVIOUS RECORDS. THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN CALENDAR YEAR BROUGHT THE LARGEST DEADLIEST AND MOST DAMAGING FIRES IN THE STATE'S HISTORY. DESPITE ADDITIONAL PRECIPITATION OVER THE PAST EVERAL YEARS VEGETATION REMAINS CRITICALLY DRY. AND WEATHER EVENTS ARE MORE EXTREME. THE CENTRALAND SOUTHERN SIERRA CONTINUE TO BE AFFECTED BY TREE MORTALITY WHICH HAS RESULTED IN OVER A HUNDRED FORTY MILLION. TREES AND CREATED MORE VOLATILE AND FLAMMABLE FLAMMABLE VEGETATION [inaudible] ACCORDINGLY. THE BUDGET PROPOSES FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS FOR A COMPREHENSIVE PACKAGE OF ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS. TO INCREASE FIRE PREVENTION ACTIVITIES TO REDUCE THE RISK OF CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES AND ENHANCE THE STATE'S FIREFIGHTING CAPABILITIES. SO. THE A LOT FOUR HUNDRED FORTY ONE MILLION CAN REALLY BE.

THESE ENGINES WILL ENHANCE CAL FIRES EMERGENCY RESPONSE CAPABILITIES AND WILL MITIGATE THE POTENTIAL FOR CATASTROPHIC WHILE THE VENTS IN AT RISK COMMUNITIES.

FINALLY THE BUDGET ALSO PROPOSES NINE POINT SEVEN MILLION GENERAL FUND TO IMPROVE THE USE OF TECHNOLOGY AND SUPPORT CAL FIRE SITUATIONAL AWARENESS CAPABILITIES -- DIRECTOR GALA TO CHEAT ALLUDED TO THOSE SO I WILL STOP THERE AND HAPPY ANSWERING QUESTIONS. THANK YOU WILL HOLD ON QUESTIONS AGAIN ALCOHOLICS TO THE AND LET'S GO AHEAD. AND HERE FROM THE ALLEY OUT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR JUST COMPUTERS WITH THE ANALYST'S OFFICE -- IF WE COULD RETURN TO THE HAND OUT THAT WE HAD ON THE FIRST PANEL ON PAGE SEVEN WE HAVE A SUMMARY OF THE GOVERNOR'S A WILD FIRE RELATED BUDGET PROPOSALS -- AS YOU CAN SEE IN THE AND THE TABLE ON PAGE SEVEN WE'VE WE PACKAGE THESE THINGS TOGETHER A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY. THAN THAN WHAT MR ALL ME DESCRIBE AND AT THE SAME AND THE SAME COMPONENTS THE NUMBERS ARE NUMBERS ARE A LITTLE BIT HIGHER WE'VE INCLUDED IN HERE THE LOCAL AND RECOVERY ASSISTANCE IT'S INCLUDED -- SOME OF WHICH ARE CURRENT YOUR ACTIONS ON THAT THE GOVERNOR IS -- ASKING FOR TO WAIVE THE LOCAL SHARE OF DEBRIS REMOVAL COSTS FOR PROPERTY TAX BACK FILL AND THEN THERE'S ALSO SOME -- FEDERAL DISASTER RECOVERY GRANT FUNDS AND SO WE'VE INCLUDED THAT IN. AND AS MR ARMEY NOTED A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE SPENDING TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE MILLION IS. TO IMPLEMENT THE A PACKAGE OF BILLS THAT WERE PASSED IN. TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND AND REALLY A LOT OF THE NEW PIECES THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THIS BUDGET BEYOND WHAT THE LEGISLATURE IS ALREADY INDICATED IS HOPING FOR FALLEN THIS ENHANCED FIRE PROTECTION -- AND THESE ARE THE THE CAL FIRE RESOURCES THAT MR ARMEY DISCUSS THAT THE THIRTEEN YEAR ROUND FIRE ENGINES THE FIRST PHASE OF THAT IS THE ONE THIRTY AIRCRAFT. AND THAT THE NUMBERS THAT MISTER ARMEY PRESENTED OR A LITTLE HIGHER FOR THE ENHANCE FIRE PROTECTION I THINK THE MINISTRATION IS ALSO -- POINTING OUT THE HUNDRED AND NINE MILLION DOLLARS FOR HELICOPTERS THAT'S NOT A BUDGET PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU THIS YEAR THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE APPROVED IN THE CURRENT YEAR AND AND IT'S A MULTI YEAR PLAN -- BUT THAT IS ONE THING TO KEEP IN MIND THAT THERE IS ADDITIONAL COSTS I RELATED TO THE CONTINUED IMPLEMENTATION ON THE HELICOPTERS. I'M AND THEN THERE'S JUST A FEW TIMES SMALLER PROPOSALS RELATED TO THE MANAGEMENT OF STATE LANDS -- AND SO WE JUST WANTED TO PRESENT THAT IS A DIFFERENT WAY OF SORT OF THINKING ABOUT. WHAT ALL THE PROPOSALS ARE? I'M WE'RE OBVIOUSLY STILL IN THE VERY PRELIMINARY STAGES OF REVIEWING THESE BETTER PROPOSALS ON AND WE WILL HAVE A MORE DETAILED -- COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR YOU AS WE GET INTO THE SUB COMMITTEE PROCESS AND THAT FOR TODAY WE WANT TO JUST MAKE SOME INITIAL ANSWER OF HIGH LEVEL COMMENTS ON HOW YOU MIGHT WANT. TO START THINKING ABOUT OVERALL AND WILD FIRES FINDING AND THEN HOW TO BALANCE PRIORITIES. AND SO FIRST I YOU'RE GONNA WANT TO THINK ABOUT. FIRE RESPONSE AND FOREST HEALTH AND FIRE PREVENTION I IF YOU LOOK AT THE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES THAT WE'RE FINDING IN THE BUDGET AND THE LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE WAS VERY FOCUSED ON FOREST HEALTH. AND FIRE PREVENTION. WHERE THE GOVERNOR'S COMING IN AND MAKING A LOT OF ADDITIONAL AND THAT? HAS BEEN THE REQUESTS ARE TEND TO BE ON THE FIRE SUPPRESSION AND FIRE RESPONSE SIDE BOTH OF THESE THINGS ARE NEEDED. BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO CONSIDER IS THE X. TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU'RE ADDING ADDITIONAL FUNDING BEYOND WAY THE LEGISLATURE ALREADY INDICATED THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE LAST YEAR. DO YOU WANT TO BALANCE BETWEEN MORE FOREST HEALTH OR MORE AT FIRE SUPPRESSION RESOURCES AND SO THAT'S SOMETHING TO CONSIDER. WHEN YOU'R LOOKING AT THE FIRE SUPPRESSION RESOURCES AND WE TOUCHED ON THIS A LITTLE BIT EARLIER THE ADMINISTRATION HAS NOT PUT FORWARD IT RECENTLY A VERY COMPREHENSIVE PLAN LOOKING AT STATE VERSUS? LOCAL AND CAPACITY AND GAPS THAT'S NOT TO SAY THIS INFORMATION IS AND NOT BEING CONSIDERED AND IT'S IT'S NOT A CRITICISM OF THE WORK THAT THE L. YES AND HOW FIRES DOING CURRENTLY. BUT IF YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT ADDING THESE BUDGET AUGMENTATIONS THERE'S BEEN A NUMBER OF THEM IN THE CURRENT YEAR AND NUMBER OF THEM IN THE PRIOR YEAR. I'M LOOKING AT ADICIONAL FIRE ENGINES LOOKING AT ADDITIONAL STAFF SEEN HELICOPTERS AIRCRAFT AND AND THEN HOW YOU FACTOR IN THE MUTUAL AID SYSTEM -- THE PRE POSITIONING RESOURCES AT WEAR THAT. AND THAT CAPACITY IS IN THE GAPS ARE IS SOMETHING THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO THINK ABOUT IT COULD AND FORMER OF A MULTI YEAR STRATEGY TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CONTINUE TO HAVE THESE VERY SEVERE FIRE SEASONS -- AND MORE AND MORE RESOURCES ARE NEEDED -- ADDITIONAL YOU KNOW FIRE ENGINES POTENTIALLY IN FUTURE YEARS WHERE YOU LOCATE THOSE -- RIGHT NOW FOR CALIFORNIA -- SORT OF CONSTRAINED AS BEST WHERE THEY PUT YOU FIRE ENGINES BASED ON WHERE THEY HAVE A STATION THAT CAN ACCEPT A NEW ENGINE. DO WE NEED TO BE THINKING LONGER TERM ABOUT CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS TO THE NEED TO BE BUILDING NEW STATIONS JUST HAVING A BROADER ASSESSMENT COULD HELP AND FORMER OF A MULTI YEAR STRATEGY. SO YOU HAVE A SENSE OF WHERE WHERE WE TRYING TO GET TO IN TERMS OF READINESS -- AND ALSO WHAT THOSE COSTS ARE GOING TO BE OVER THE LONG TERM AND AND IS THE LEVEL THAT WERE YOU WERE TAKING ON IN THIS YEAR THE LEVEL THAT YOU'RE COMFORTABLE WITH -- KNOWING WHERE IT MIGHT GO IN THE FUTURE -- AND I WILL JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT AND ACTUALLY WANT ONE MORE THING I YOU'VE YOU'VE ALREADY AND PROBABLY A HER A NOTED THIS IN A PREVIOUS REPORT THAT WE'VE COME OUT WITH AND BUT WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE PROPERTY TAX BACK FILLS THERE'S JUST POLICY CHOICES FOR YOU. TO CONSIDER YOU'RE GONNA WANT TO THINK ABOUT. THE NATURE OF HOW YOU DO IT IS THAT I'M YOU KNOW ONE TIME IS THAT MULTIPLE YEARS AND SO THERE'S JUST POLICY CHOICES WE JUST WANTED TO REMIND YOU OF THAT AND SO WITH AYE AYE WILL END AND THE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. WE OFTEN FOLLOWED BY LUMIGAN ABSURD TO AYE KOWSKI STERN. AND WHAT YOU NAY MCGUIRE. THE TO NIELSEN. THIS SHOULD BE UP. AND OBSERVATION [inaudible] BUT IT'S I GOING FORWARD OBSERVATION. APPLICABLE THE THINGS THAT WE DO. PROTECT THE IN TERMS OF PREVENTION. THE FIRE TAX WAS IMPOSED SEVERAL YEARS AGO. IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS THEREAFTER IN MY INQUIRIES IN THE BUDGET. SUBCOMMITTEE. ABOUT HOW THOSE MONIES WERE USED. AND THE PUBLIC WAS PROMISED SUPPRESSION [inaudible] WELL. THAT DIDN'T EXACTLY HAPPEN. AND IT DID NOT INSPIRE IN ME CONFIDENCE. THAT THAT WAS A VERY GOOD INVESTMENT. BECAUSE CAL FIRE DIDN'T USED. FOR THE PURPOSES IT WAS PRESENTED AND PROMISED. AND I TAKE IT CANNOT BE MUCH ARGUED THAT. IT WASN'T A GRAND SUCCESS BASED ON WHAT WE'VE SEEN WITH THESE FIRES. MY POINT TO THAT IS WHATEVER WE DO PROSPECTIVELY WE NEED TO HAVE SET UP TRACKING. AND THE LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEES NEED TO BE VERY TOUGH IN THEIR SCRUTINY OF HOW RESOURCES THAT ARE DEPLOYED AS WE WILL BE IN THIS BUDGET. NUMBER THANK THE GOVERNOR FOR WHAT HE'S BEING WILLING TO DEPLOY. WITH THAT KEEP AN EYE ON AND MAKE SURE IT IS USED FOR THE PURPOSES INTENDED AND PROMISED. AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S NECESSARILY BEEN SOLD HERE THUS FAR. IT WILL BE THE SAME THING AS WE GET INTO ANOTHER SECTION HERE AND THAT'S THE NINE ONE ONE ISSUE THE GOVERNOR'S CAMANCHE WITH THE PROPOSAL THIS YEAR SOMEONE NOW THE GENERAL FUND AND THEN THEY'LL BE SOME. DECIDING FOR THE NEXT RESOURCES ARE GOING TO BE. IN OUR DISCUSSIONS LAST YEAR THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT CAME UP AT THE VERY END OF THE YEAR. THERE WAS NOT MUCH CLARITY ABOUT. WHAT KIND OF SYSTEM ARE WE TALKING ABOUT? THAT WE NEED AN IMPROVEMENT I DON'T THINK IS IN QUESTION. BUT CALIFORNIA HAS BLOWN SO MANY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. ON TECHNOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS. THAT DIDN'T WORK. AND MY SENSITIVITY HERE WHATEVER WE'RE GOING TO DO ABOUT NINE ONE ONE AND THEN PROVING THAT COMMUNICATION AND THAT ALSO DOES INCLUDE THE COMMUNICATION IN THE FIELD NOT JUST TO THE NINE ONE ONE OPERATOR. WE BETTER MAKE DARN SURE. THAT WHOEVER WE'RE CONTRACTING WHETHER WHATEVER PRODUCT WE'RE CONTRACTING. FOR WE HAVE THE HIGHEST DEGREE OF ASSURANCE. THAT IS GOING TO WORK. AND WE HAVE SOME BENCHMARKS. THE PROVIDER HAS GOT TO HEED. TO ENSURE. IT DOES THE JOB AND WE JUST KEEP DOT KEEP THROWING MONEY AT AS I THINK SO MANY TIMES WE DO HERE IN CALIFORNIA [inaudible] THE SO THE GETTING BACK TO TWO THE THE DEFENSIBLE SPACE. AS WE MOVE AHEAD. ARE WE GOING TO BE. PAYING A LOT OF ATTENTION TO DEFENSIBLE SPACE AND NOT JUST AROUND THE HOMES. FOR THE PROPERTIES. BUT THE AREAS. ONE OF THE THINGS CHANGED IN THE RECENT YEARS THESE FIRES NOW OR ENCROACHING ON THE SIX READING SANTA ROSA FOR EXAMPLE IS THAT'S SOMETHING WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING AHEAD TO NOW. OF DO NOT HOW WE HAVE THESE BUFFER ZONES IF YOU WILL OR WHAT WHAT ARE WE LOOKING AT IN TERMS OF THE PREVENTION AND ANTICIPATING WHERE THE FIRES ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BE THE MOST LIKELY. TO DO THE MOST DAMAGE. I GATHER THAT'S PARTY OF PRE POSITIONING THE CONSIDERATION IS NOT [inaudible] OKAY. THAT'S TRUE THAT'S COUPLE OF OBSERVATIONS AS WE MOVE AHEAD. I I JUST LIKE TO HAVE THAT. TO BIG KNOWLEDGE AND AND WOULD LIKE TO HAVE AS WE GO THROUGH THE BUDGET COME TO US WITH SOME FACTS AND SOME INFORMATION. WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT WITH THESE COMMUNICATION PROCEDURES THAT WE'RE GOING TO EMPLOY AND DEPLOY? ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS PROACTIVE IN THIS PROBABLY OF SMALL. SIGNIFICANCE BUT NOT IN CONSEQUENCE. I'M A BIG DOUBLE K. F. C. C. C.. A PARTICULAR NOW WHEN INMATE FIREFIGHTERS ARE NOT AS RELIABLE. IN TERMS OF NUMBERS OR IN TERMS OF THE QUALITY THE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE OUT IN THE CAMPS. AND SO I'VE BEEN PUSHING FOR CCC DEPLOYMENT AND UP ON THE RIDGE WE WERE ABLE TO OPEN UP A CCC CAMP. NOW I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY OF THOSE. FOLKS WORKED ON THE FIRE LINES WITH THEY WERE RIGHT WHERE THEY NEED TO BE THEY WERE PRE POSITION IF YOU WILL. FOR THOSE WHO SOME CONSIDERATIONS I THINK THIS PROSPECTIVELY WOULD BE. VERY HELPFUL TO US. JUST SOME OBSERVATIONS BUT THESE ARE THINGS THAT NEED TO BE A PART OF OUR CONTINUING DIALOGUE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU VERY. ON THE EARLY -- MISS PETERS CAM WE JUMPED TO THE CHART ON PAGE SIX BECAUSE THE NET GENERAL FUND COSTS IS GOING TO BE NINE HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS. YOUR PRESENTATION WAS THAT NORMALLY THERE'S A LOCAL SPLIT WITH THAT. SEVENTY FIVE TWENTY FIVE SO THE LOCALS UNDER THE NORMAL COURSE WOULD BE EXPECTED TO PAY TWO HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS HOWEVER THE GOVERNOR HAS SUGGESTED THAT. THAT WE WAIVE A HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS SO THAT WOULD LEAVE THE LOCALS WITH. ROUGHLY EIGHTY MILLION BUCKS NOT COUNTING THE THIRTY ONE THAT WE'RE GONNA BACK TO ON THE PROPERTY TAXES THAT'S ANOTHER THING BUT ARE WE ARE WE EXPECTING THE LOCAL. AREAS TO CHIP IN FOR THEIR SEVEN TO AN EIGHTY MILLION. TO MY UNDERSTANDING AND AND FINANCE CAN ALWAYS CLARIFY THIS -- WHEN WE GET TO THE NEXT PANEL OF MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THESE NUMBERS ACTUALLY REFLECT ALREADY REFLECT THE STATE COVERING THE LOCAL CULTURE? SO THAT THE THE NUMBERS THAT ARE ON THIS CHART WHICH WE'VE TAKEN FROM THE ADMINISTRATION'S ESTIMATES ON ALREADY REFLECT US COTTON SUPPORT WILL GET TOGETHER. HEADS UP ON NOW LET'S JUMP TO THE OUT WILDLIFE. URBAN INTERFACE AYE AYES ICY IT THOUGH -- WILDLAND FIRE FIGHTERS YOU KNOW THE MANAGE FOR FIRES THERE'S WE'VE READ A LOT SINCE WE WERE KIDS ABOUT NATURAL OCCURRING FIRES THE NEED FOR THE SEATS. TO POP UP URBAN FIREFIGHTERS WITH THE CHART WITH THE THE MUTUAL AID THEY'RE DESIGNED TO TAKE OUT. THOSE THOSE FIRES WHATEVER IT IS THEY RUSSIAN AND THEY AND THEY PUT IT OUT HOW DO WE TREAT THESE WILDFIRES IN THIS WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE AND GIVEN THE NOON OR ABNORMAL THAT WE HAVE WHAT YOU'RE THINKING GOING FORWARD ON THESE -- THE INTERFACE AREAS NOT THE OUT THE BACK LAND THE INTERFACE. HELLO AGAIN -- TOM BORDER CAL FIRE -- DIRECTOR -- AND SENATOR I WANTED. TO MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND THAT -- WHY I WILDLAND FIRE AND -- INTERFACE BUYER ARE THE SAME FIRE. IN IN OUR OUR RESPECTED -- WE WE ARE OUR INTENT IS TO PUT EVERY FIRE OUT THE STARTS -- THAT WE DON'T WE ARE USING AS A PRESCRIBED FIRE -- AT TEN ACRES OR LESS AND WE MEET THAT 95% OF THE TIME AND THAT'S IN ALL HONESTY RESPONSIBILITY AREA THROUGHOUT THE STATE. FOR SERVICE HAS A SIMILAR -- GOALS AS WELL -- IN. CALIFORNIA -- IS -- RESPONSE WE WE DO NOT MANAGE FIRE -- WE FIGHT FIRE AND WE PUT BY HERSELF AND AND THAT'S ON ALL LANDS THAT WERE RESPONSIBLE [inaudible] FOR SO -- WHEN YOU GET TO THE NATIONAL FOREST SYSTEM THERE ARE SOME AREAS OF THE STATE -- PARTICULARLY IN THOSE BACK WOODS AREAS WHERE NATURAL STARTS -- WILL BE MANAGED -- BUT AGAIN WE ARE NOT PART OF THAT SYSTEM THAT WOULD BE THE FEDERAL SYSTEM. AND WE WATCH THOSE VERY CAREFULLY BECAUSE OFTEN WHAT HAPPENS IS THOSE FIRES GROW TO A POINT WHERE THEY COME OUT OF THERE PRESCRIPTION. AND START TO COME INTO THE STATE RESPONSIBILITY AREA SO WE MONITOR THOSE CLICK CLOSELY -- AND MAKE SURE THAT THE FOR SERVICES MEETING THER OBLIGATIONS TO KEEP THEIR FIRES OFF OF PRIVATE LAND AS WELL. GIVEN THE EVOLVING SCIENCE ON CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE FREQUENCY OF SEVERE WEATHER AND FIRES HAS THAT CHANGED YOUR THINKING OR THE COMMUNITIES THINKING ABOUT. FOR PUTTING ON EVERY FIRE IS THERE ASEFI GOING ON THAT THERE MAY BE SOME FIRES THAT WE NEED TO MANAGE BY LETTING THEM BURN SINCE THAT. BE A NATURALLY OCCURRING PIC OF PHENOMENA IN CALIFORNIA IS THAT THAT IS A VERY GOOD QUESTION AND AGAIN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FEDERAL SYSTEM AND AND AND CAL FIRE -- WORKING WITH THE PRIVATE LANDOWNERS. IS THAT THAT WE'RE WORKING WITH EVERY SINGLE PRIVATE LANDOWNER OR A STATE CONSERVANCY OR STATE LANDOWNER. IN THE STATE AND EVERYONE OF THEM HAS A DIFFERENT -- MANAGEMENT REGIME THAT THEY SEE FOR THEIR PRIVATE LAND -- WE CANNOT -- ENTER INTO -- WHAT WOULD BE IN? MILLIONS OF DIFFERENT AGREEMENTS -- ON THE NUMBER OF PARCELS THAT ARE OUT THERE IN THE IN THE WILD LAND -- IN ORDER TO HAVE BE ABLE TO HAVE A FIDELITY OF WHICH WHICH LANDOWNER WANTS FIRE TO BURN ACROSS THEIR PRIVATE LAND. OR NOT. SO WE HAVE TO ASSUME ALL OF THE FIRES OUT -- TO THE BEST OF OUR ABILITY AND THAT'S WHERE WE HAVE THE 95% -- OF ALL FIRES LESS THAN TEN ACRES AND AND I I DO UNDERSTAND THE ECOLOGICAL -- PIECE OF WHAT YOU'RE WHAT YOU'RE GETTING. TO AND THAT THAT IS GOING TO BE -- ADDRESSED THROUGH ARE PRESCRIBED FIRE -- AND FUELS MANAGEMENT GOALS THAT WE'RE INCREASING -- CURRENTLY ACROSS THE STATE THERE'S ABOUT -- TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND ACRES ON STATE AND PRIVATE LANDS THAT ARE DONE ANNUALLY. AND WE'RE LOOKING TO DOUBLE THAT IN IN THROUGH THROUGH THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE FORCE CARBON PLAN. AND TO MEET THE RESILIENCY GOAL SO WE WILL BE DOING A LOT MORE FUELS REDUCTION PROJECT WORK AND PRESCRIBED BURNING THAT WILL BE UNDER UNDER OUR TERMS. ON LANDS THAT WE HAVE AGREEMENTS -- WHERE THE LAND OWNERS WANT THAT TYPE OF ACTIVITY TO HAPPENED? EVEN WITH A DOUBLING OF OUR IN THE IN THE ADDITIONAL MONEY SAID PUT AND I'LL GET TO THE SUPPRESSION PREVENTION BALANCE. FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES AT A THIRTY THREE MILLION ACRES IS THAT ENOUGH GIVEN GIVEN THE M. GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF GROWTH OF OF PEOPLE MOVING IT LIVING IN THESE CONDITIONS IN THE IN THE WILD LANDS. AND GIVEN THE FACT THAT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS MAKE THOSE DECISIONS NOT TO STATE. AND THAT'S ANOTHER GOOD QUESTION -- AS OF TODAY AND THAT IS WHAT THE SCIENCE SAYS IS ENOUGH TO TO TO START TO RESTORE FORCED RESILIENCY -- IT IS BALANCED BY A HALF NATIONAL FOREST IS TRYING TO DO IN CALIFORNIA AT THE SAME TIME SO. IT'S ACTUALLY ONE MILLION ACRES ACROSS -- BOTH LANDSCAPES -- AND THAT'S WHAT THE FORCE CARBON PLAN KIND OF HONED IN ON AND AND CAME UP WITH THAT'S THE NUMBER THAT WE NEED TO DO -- WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO TREAT EVERY SINGLE ACRE THAT THAT COULD USE -- THAT KIND OF TREATMENT -- WILL HAVE TO DO THE ONES THAT THAT ARE ARE ACCESSIBLE TO US AND WE OR WHERE WE HAVE AGREEMENTS TO DO SO -- AND THEN -- IT'S GOING TO TAKE DECADES TO OF RETURN FOREST HEALTH TO WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE AND THERE ARE GOING TO BE CHANGES ALONG THE WAY IT COULD BE THAT THE NEXT ITERATION OF THE OF THE CARBON PLAN -- COULD TELL US SOMETHING DIFFERENT BUT RIGHT NOW THAT'S WHERE WE ARE COULD YOU HELP US UNDERSTAND THE TREE REMOVAL -- CATASTROPHE THAT WE HAVE YOUR PREDECESSOR TESTIFIED HIS THROUGH SEPT TWO LAST YEAR THAT THAT. YOU OVER -- TO GET A MILLION TREES REMOVED THERE'S A HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION DEAD TREES IN CALIFORNIA IT'S TAKING CAL FIRE TWO YEARS. SO THIS IS THE PRESCRIBED BURNS IS A DIFFERENT PART OF THE BUDGET ON THAT DEAD TREES. WHAT'S WHAT SHOULD WE BE TO AND WHAT SHOULD I BE DEMANDING OF% CAL FIRE AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND COUNTIES AND PRIVATE LAND OWNERS. THE AND THEN ANOTHER REALLY GOOD QUESTION BECAUSE ACROSS THE HUNDRED A HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVEN MILLION. TREES THAT ARE OUT THERE DEAD OR APPROXIMATELY -- IT'S NOT REASONABLE TO THINK THAT WE'RE GOING. TO TAKE DOWN EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE OUR ACROSS THIS ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE IN PLACES WHERE -- DEAD TREES ARE PART OF THE OF THE THE LANDSCAPE AND AND THAT AND SOME OF THAT'S OKAY. SO. WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON ON THOSE AREAS WHERE HUMAN AND -- BUT WHERE ARE INFRASTRUCTURE IS AND WHERE THERE IS CRITICAL NEED TO REMOVE TREES IN ORDER TO PROTECT THOSE. THAT INFRASTRUCTURE -- WHEN WE GET INTO THE THE DEEPER WOODS OR THE BACK COUNTRY THEN WE HAVE THERE THERE'S A A DECISION THAT HAS TO BE MADE AS TO WHETHER OR NOT WE CAN EXPECT? THE FOREST TO RECOVER ON ITS OWN -- WHETHER THEY'RE ST PLANTING THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE WHETHER SOME OF THOSE TREES NEED TO BE REMOVED OR NOT BASED ON ALL OF THOSE FACTORS -- WHAT I WILL -- IT WOULD POINT YOU TO THINK ABOUT IS WHEN THOSE TREES THAT ARE DEAD FALL AND ARE STREWN ABOUT ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE THEY'RE GOING TO BE THERE FOR FIFTY PLUS YEARS AS FUELS. THAT WILL -- BURN IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS THE CALM. AND SO WE DO HALF WE HAVE TO LOOK AT IF WE DO INVEST IN REFORESTATION AND PLANTING. SOME OF THOSE AREAS IN THE BACK COUNTRY SOME OF THAT FUEL DOES NEED TO BE REMOVED THE TREES NEED TO BE DROPPED. BUT THERE'S AN ECOLOGICAL RE GROUND AS WELL SO THERE THIS IT'S A VERY COMPLEX ISSUE. AND WE REALLY JUST NEED TO FOCUS ON THOSE ON THOSE -- HUMAN INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS AND WHERE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE SAFE AND AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS GOING TO BE SO WE HAVE ANOTHER GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS REDUCTION CHALLENGE ALSO SO WHILE WHILE IT MIGHT BE. MIGHT WORK FROM AN ECOLOGICAL POINT OF VIEW WITH THE WITH THE FOR THE FORCE THAT IS ALSO INCREASING THE EMISSIONS THAT -- WE MAY BE ABLE TO SPEED THAT UP IF THEY WERE CHAPTER OR ARE SOME FROM REMOVED. I'M CONCERNED WITH THE BALANCE YOU KNOW -- AND I'M WONDERING WHEN WE GET THE TIP HIT THE TIPPING POINT ON PREVENTION AND SUPPRESSION YOU KNOW THAT IT'S NO IT'S IT'S NOT. A SECRET THAT THE BULK OF THE MONEY THAT'S BEING ASKED FROM THE AGENCIES BEFORE S.. ALTHOUGH WE'RE NOT. CONSIDERING THAT RIGHT NOW WITH THE FULL LOOK FOR TO THAT IN SUB TOO BUT IT'S ON SUPPRESSION AND THE NEW MONEY THAT'S COMING IN IS BY THE ADMINISTRATION'S POINT OUT BODY ALITALIA'S REPORT. ISON SUPPRESSION WHEN DO WE MEET THE TIPPING POINT BECAUSE IT SEEMS. TO ME THAT IF WE IF WE DOUBLED DOWN ON THE PREVENTION TO REMOVE SOME OF THE FUELS THEN WE MIGHT NOT NEED. FOUR HUNDRED RESPONSES FROM THE CITY'S CHANNEL I DON'T HAVE FIRES IN MY DISTRICT BUT THE CAL FREMONT. POLICE DEPARTMENT SAN JOSE THEY WERE ALL FROM RESPOND THERE'S THIRD THEY RESPONDED SO FAR MAYBE THIS YEAR I'LL BE. I'LL BE FILLED WITH THAT BUT I'M JUST SAYING THAT THAT THAT THE RESPONSE BUT THERE AGAIN I THINK THAT THEY THEIR CHARGES IS DIFFERENT WIN. IF WE'RE INVESTING. MY QUESTION IS IS THAT ON THESE. AN OUNCE OF PREVENTION IS WORTH A POUND OF CURE RIDER WITH A VICE VERSA POUND THE PREVENTION FIRST NOW SECURE. PUT SO. HELP ME WITH THE A CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW WITH THESE EXPECTATION OF GIGANTIC FIRES AND MODICUM OF PREVENTION I MEAN I I I I I. E.. I'D LIKE TO THINK THAT WE COULD DO MORE IN THE PREVENTION FEEL SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO ESCALATE -- THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE AND A MINUTE AND THEN. TAKE THE SURVEY PLEASE PLEASE. YEAH OKAY -- JUST JUST JUST CLEAR BY -- A COUPLE OF THINGS -- EVERY ACRE IN CALIFORNIA THAT CAN BURN WILL BURN SOME DAY AND SO WE WE HAVE WE HAVE TO KIND OF KEEP THAT IN MIND SO. YES MAYBE. EACH OF OUR AREAS DOESN'T HAVE IRE EVERY YEAR BUT HOPEFULLY NOT NEXT YEAR -- ANNA AND I WOULD -- REFLECT THAT THIS COMING YEAR THAT HAS ALL THE INDICATIONS OF BEING JUST AS AS POSSIBLY COULD TELL BECAUSE AS LAST YEAR AND THE YEAR BEFORE -- SO RELATED TO THE THE SUPPRESSION VERSUS PREVENTION -- IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO PARSE THOSE OUT WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT CAL FIRE -- EVERY FIRE ENGINE THAT THAT -- THAT COMES INTO OUR SYSTEM -- IS BOTH SUPPRESSION. AND PREVENTION. AND THOSE ENGINE COMPANIES ARE CUTTING DOWN TREES IN SOME CASES THEY'RE BUILDING A FIRE LINE TO DO PRESCRIBED FIRES. THEY'RE PUTTING FIRE ON THE GROUND AND DOING PRESCRIBED FIRE PROJECT WORK THEY'RE DOING FUEL OTHER FUELS READ IT READ REDUCTION WORK THEY'RE DOING DEFENSIBLE SPACE INSPECTIONS -- BUT IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE HAVE SO ANY ANYTHING THAT YOU INVEST IN OR OR THAT THE STATE INVESTS IN -- RELATED TO RESOURCES THAT ARE CAL FIRE RESOURCES DO BOTH -- ALL OF THE INVESTMENT WHILE IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT AS WELL. IN IN OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT PARTNERSHIP THAT CAN BE CONSIDERED. SUPPRESSION BECAUSE WE DON'T EMPLOY D.. MUTUAL AID RATE RESOURCES FROM IN THE STATE RESPONSIBILITY AREA DOING. PREVENTION. NOW THEY MIGHT DO PREVENTION IN THEIR IN THEIR LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA. BUT AS FAR AS THE STATE RESPONSIBILITY AREA THE THOSE RESOURCES DON'T DO THAT SO ANYTHING THAT YOU THAT HAS A CAL FIRE PATCH ON IT IT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED. AS BOTH PREVENTION AND SUPPRESSION AND BY AND LARGE. THAT INVESTMENT IS IN PREVENTION BECAUSE WHILE THEIR TRAINING THEY'RE GETTING PREPARED. TO DO SUPPRESSION AND PREVENTION. THEN WHEN THEY'RE NOT TRAINING. THEIR ONLY RESPONDING TO INCIDENTS WHEN THEY'RE INCIDENTS GOING. ALL THE REST OF THE TIME THEY'RE DOING PREVENTION ACTIVE. SO VERY MUCH -- THE ENGINES. AND AND THE CREWS -- THE THE SENATOR NIELSEN THE THE CCC CREWS THAT WERE ADDING VERY MUCH ARE PREVENTION RESOURCES. SO I THINK I'D LIKE TO CAN MAYBE MAYBE TALK FURTHER -- AT SOME POINT ABOUT HOW HOW WE CAN MAYBE BREAK THAT DOWN IN PERCENTAGE WISE IT FORWARD KIND OF YOU GIVE A BETTER -- APPLES TO APPLES COMPARISON OF OF PREVENTION VERSUS -- AND I I GUESS MY FINAL QUESTION MADAM -- CHAIRS AT THE BUDGET AS FOR HUNDRED NINETY NINE NEW -- POSITIONS OR SEIZE SOMEONE FULL TIME HOW WOULD THAT HUNDRED AND NINETY NINE HAD MADE A DIFFERENCE IF YOU HAD THEM IN. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND AND JUST. TO ENTERTAIN ME GIVE ME A BREAK DOWN ON THE PREVENTION SUPPRESSION. WORK THERE WITH THEM BUT IF YOU HAD THEM DURING THESE BIG FIRES WHAT. DIFFERENCE IF ANY WOULD HAVE MADE. THAT IS A VERY GOOD QUESTION AND I I I HOPE I DON'T SURPRISE YOU BY THE ANSWER -- THE WELL IF I A I COULD BREAK THEM DOWN I'D LIKE TO I'D LIKE TO DO THAT AND A MORE SYSTEMATIC -- I'VE. WAY IN THE FUTURE BUT IT CAN BE BROKEN DOWN AS AS TO HOW MUCH OF THE INVESTMENT WILL BE PREVENTION VERSUS SUPPRESSION -- AND WE WILL -- RELATED TO WHAT WITH THE IMPACT OF BàN. BY THE IMPACT. OF HAVING MORE FIREFIGHTERS -- AVAILABLE TO US ON THE GROUND WOULD HAVE BEEN THAT WE WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET PEOPLE OFF THE LINE. AND BACK HOME. TO SEE THEIR FAMILIES AND NOT HAVE TO BE OUT ON FIRE ASSIGNMENTS. FOR FORTY FIVE TO SIXTY DAYS -- WHICH HAS A VERY A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT IN THE MORALE WHEN YOU'RE OUT ON THE LINE BITING FIRE AND THE ABILITY TO KEEP GOING KNOWING THAT YOU'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO GO HOME AND SEE YOUR FAMILY. WE WEREN'T ABLE TO DO THAT THIS LAST YEAR. WE HAD WE HAD HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF FIREFIGHTERS THAT DID NOT GO HOME ALMOST ALL SUMMER LONG -- THEY MISSED A LOT OF OF FAMILY EVENTS AND AND IT'S TAKING A TOLL NOW -- I A I A PERSONAL FRIENDS THE THAT ARE VERY MUCH -- HURTING. NOT SLEEPING. ARE AND THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO FIX AND THIS IS THAT'S ANOTHER. ASPECT OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE WE'RE TRYING TO GET THE SUPPORT FOR OUR OUR FIREFIGHTERS TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO DO THE WORK THAT THEY'RE DOING. ON BEHALF OF THE OF THE CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA AND CONTINUE TO RESPOND. TO THIS INCREASING INDUCED -- EVENT THAT WERE. WHAT LIVING TO HOLD THE REST MY QUESTIONS RANDOM CHAIR AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SHARING THEM WITH YOU ALL? MENTORSHIPS SUBCOMMITTEE HEARINGS [inaudible] YEAH. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. UP UP PICK UP WHERE YOU LEFT OFF THEIR DIRECTOR -- WE'RE HAPPY TO HAVE YOU ON BOARD NOW -- DICK PORTER AND YEAH YOU. AND YOUR EXPERIENCE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IS HUGE YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF ALL THE STATE WIDE NOOKS AND CRANNIES JUST SOMEONE WHO REALLY UNDERSTANDS THE OPERATIONS A GIFT TO THE STATE AND I KNOW YOU GOT BIG SHOES TO FILL BY NOW YOU'RE GONNA FILM SO -- SO THANK YOU FOR FOR BEING THERE -- IN ON THAT NOTE. IT'S A DARK STATISTIC BUT THE SUICIDE RATES ARE ACTUALLY OVERCOMING THE FIRE LINE DEATHS -- FOR THE FIRST TIME IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN SO MORE. MORE THE MEN AND WOMEN. FIGHTING FIRES OR SHOULD LOSE THEIR LIVES FROM SUICIDE THAN THEY ARE FROM ACTUAL RISKS. THE OBVIOUS FIRST RISK OF THE JOB AND THE PTS I ISSUES REAL AND WE'RE GONNA BE WORKING REALLY HARD ON THAT THIS YEAR WE APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR BRING IN FORD -- SOME PROPOSALS ON STUDYING THIS FURTHER LOOKING AT THE WELLNESS SIDE OF THINGS -- BECAUSE YOU KNOW EVERY PEOPLE ARE HEARD AND YOU CAN'T JUST -- CRAM THAT AWAY AND JUST PRETEND LIKE IT'S NOT REAL. RESULTING IN ALL KINDS OF STRANGE TENSIONS OUT THERE SO -- LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH YOU ON THAT -- I WANTED TO GET A SENSE -- FROM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE JUST PULL IN THAT THREAD FROM THE LAST PANEL ON THIS SORT OF THIS. MULTI YEAR PLANNING QUESTION AND ALSO. THIS NOTION OF OKAY WERE TRYING TO STRIKE A BALANCE BETWEEN SUPPRESSION PREVENTION BUT IS IS THE OVERALL LIKE RIGHT SIZING THAT OVERALL NUMBER. I THINK YOU HEARD DIRECTOR GIVE THE DUDE SHE SHOULD TALK ABOUT IT DIDN'T INSERT A BROAD SCOPE BUT HOW HOW ARE YOU ALL THINKING ABOUT THIS TO DEAL WITH IN TERMS OF ACTUALLY RIGHT SIZING THE BOTH. NEAR TERM AND LONG TERM -- BUDGET YOU KNOW ALLOCATION SAID THE SCOPE OF THE RISK. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION -- I THINK NEAR TERM AND LONG TERM TO ACTUALLY A REALLY GOOD WAY TO THINK ABOUT IT -- THIS IS SO -- CHIEF PORTER MENTIONED THAT -- THESE ENGINES SPECIFICALLY ARE BOTH. SUPPRESSION IN PREVENTION AND THE REASON WHY WE'RE ASKING FOR YEAR ROUND ENGINES KINDA UNDERSCORING CHIEF PORTERS POINT. REASON WHY WE'RE ASKING FOR YEAR ROUND ENGINES AS OPPOSED TO SEASONAL. ENGINES IS TO REALLY DOUBLE DOWN ON THE FIRE PREVENTION -- A PROJECTS IN DURING THE OFF SEASON. WE COULD HAVE EASILY. TRIED TO KIND OF SAVE SOME GENERAL FUND MAYBE AND JUST SAY WELL WE'LL DO THIRTEEN NEW SEASONAL. ENGINES BUT I THINK WE'RE GETTING TO THE POINT OF WITH -- LOOKING OF RETURN ON NVESTMENT NOT WANTING TO BE PENNY WISE POUND FOOLISH. AND WE BELIEVE THESE -- THIRTEEN ARE AND WHAT YOU WOULD CALL NO REGRETS TYPE INVESTMENTS IN. WE SO GETTING MEN TO KIND OF HOW WE LOOK AT THINGS -- FISCALLY AND KIND OF THIS RETURN ON INVESTMENT ONES. WE WORK WITH CAL FIRE AND SOME PRELIMINARY DATA AND A PRELIMINARY KIND OF RISK FACTORS SEARCHES FIRE IGNITION SEARCHES -- HIGH HAZARD SEVERITIES OWNS SUCH AS HAVE OVAL STRUCTURES. AND CONCLUDED THAT. ADDING IN THE NEAR TERM THIRTEEN ENGINES IN SOME OF THESE STRATEGICALLY LOCATED PLACES -- WERE CLEAR NO REGRETS INVESTMENTS BUT ALSO RECOGNIZING. THIS IS GOING TO BE A LONG TERM PROBLEM. HANDED THAT CALIFORNIA IS ACTUALLY GOING TO BE INITIATING A MORE OF A STRATEGIC PLANNING. PROCESS. GOING FORWARD IT LOOKS AT MANY OF THESE VERY THINGS THAT YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT TRYING TO TURN OVER TO PORTER TO REALLY TALK ABOUT KIND THIS LONG TERM STRATEGIC PLANNING THING THAT THEY ARE INITIATING INITIATING. THANK YOU OF MATT A AND YES WE IN IN OUR REDRAFT OF OUR STRATEGIC PLAN -- WHICH IS IN PRINT -- WE HAVE FOUR GOALS AND GOAL NUMBER ONE IS ASSESSING OUR CORE CAPABILITIES -- WHICH WOULD INCLUDE -- ARE SUPPRESSION PREVENTION -- RESOURCE MANAGEMENT. AND FIRE MARSHAL ACTIVITIES IN THE ALL THE ALL THE ALL ALL THE WHERE WE HAVE BOOTS ON THE GROUND -- AND SO WE'RE GONNA DO A TOP TO BOTTOM REVIEW OF OF WHAT OUR RESPONSIBILITIES ARE AND WHAT THE NEEDS ARE FOR THE FUTURE AND LOOKING. YOU KNOW TWENTY THIRTY DOWN THE YEARS DOWN THE ROAD -- ARE WE POSITIONED -- APPROPRIATELY TO BE ABLE TO MEET -- THE MISSION OF THE DEPARTMENT -- AND TO GO FORWARD AND THEN STARTED -- TO PLOT A COURSE -- TO CORRECT ANY DEFICIENCIES AND IF WE HAVE ANY OVERAGES AND OTHER AREAS WILL WILL WILL WILL BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THOSE AS WELL AND AND YOU KNOW REPROGRAM THOSE KIND OF THINGS. AS YOU DEVELOPING THAT STRATEGIC PLAN ARE YOU FOR YOU CONSIDERING SORT OF THE RISK MITIGATION ACTIVITIES OR MAYBE OUTSIDE YOUR PURVIEW AS WELL IN TERMS OF HOW. TO THE BY DOWN THAT RISK I MEAN I I'M I'M THINKING AGAIN ABOUT -- THE CREATED RIGHT ONE OF THE MAJOR CONDITIONS SOURCE IN THE STATE -- AND ONLY SO MUCH WE CAN GET DONE ON VEGETATION MANAGEMENT OR TIMBER MANAGEMENT SOME OF ITS IN HOME HARDENING IN IN THE BUILDING CODES IN IN LAND USE PLANNING SOME OF IT'S ABOUT GREAT PLANNING AND WHERE ARE WHERE WE GENERATE POWER AND CAN WE DO IT IN A DISTRIBUTED. WAY SO AT IS SPECIALLY IN THOSE AREAS UTILITIES MAYBE WANT TO BE ABLE TO SHUT OFF POWER BUT THEY DON'T WANT A BUNCH OF ANGRY RESIDENTS SAYING. WHY THEY GO DARK BUT? THERE ACTUALLY OUR SOLUTIONS THAT HAPPENED OR HOW YOU SHOULD INTEGRATING THOSE AND NONTRADITIONAL -- FACTORS INTO THE STRATEGIC PLANNING TO HELP YOU. IN A GREAT MOOD. SHE'S NOT PLEASE LET IN THE THAT IS THAT IS A KEY COMPONENT TO THIS THIS PLANNING PROCESS WHICH IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN EVEN WE WHERE WE WERE EIGHT TEN YEARS AGO AS FAR AS STRATEGIC PLANNING WE REALLY HAVE. TO LOOK AT THE THE TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO US AND LOOK AT THE ABILITY. TO TO BRING -- WAYS OF ANALYZING DATA THAT REALLY DIDN'T EVEN EXIST THE LAST TIME WE DID OUR STRATEGIC PLAN IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE SO. A GOING FORWARD ALL OF THAT'S GOING TO BE PART OF OF THE THE FORMULA THAT WE'RE USING -- OF COURSE IT WILL BE MOE FOCUSED IN IN CERTAIN AREAS OF OUR STRATEGIC PLANNING THAN IN OTHERS -- WE DO -- WELL THERE ARE OF SOME PROMISING THOUGHTS TOWARD THE FUTURE AND IN THE SUPPRESSION. OF WILDFIRES ARE USING -- REMOTE SENSING AND OTHER HUMAN -- TYPE OF OF INTERACTION WITH THAT FIRE THAT'S HAPPENING -- RIGHT NOW THERE IS THERE IS NOTHING THAT REPLACES THE BOOTS ON THE GROUND. AND EVEN OUR AIRCRAFT ARE ALL GEARED TOWARD. SLOWING OF FIRE DOWN SO WE CAN PUT BOOTS ON THE GROUND -- SO SO IT'S A VERY IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S GOT A VERY -- HUMAN GROUNDED ELEMENT -- IN OUR STRATEGIC PLANNING BUT WE ARE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT THOSE OTHER OPPORTUNITIES -- WE'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT AT THE DATA THAT'S NOW BECOMING AVAILABLE THROUGH -- THE CPUC -- AND THE THE THE THE WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLANS THAT THE UTILITIES ARE ARE ARE BRINGING -- FOR REVIEW WHICH THAT THEY'RE ALL DUE ON THE SEVENTH OF OF THAT THE FEBRUARY SUS. ONE WEEK OUT -- WILL BE STE THOSE -- WITH -- CPUC THAT WILL INFORM AND GIVE US MORE DATA TO TO UTILIZE TO KIND OF HONE IN ON THOSE AREAS THAT ARE MOST VULNERABLE IN THE GRID -- AND AND THEN BE ABLE TO TAILOR SOME OF OUR PREVENTION ACTIVITIES -- TO THOSE THOSE AREAS AND THOSE NEEDS SO ALL OF THIS IS COMING TOGETHER RIGHT NOW -- WE'RE WORKING ON OUR EXECUTIVE ORDER FOR FORTY FIVE DAY EXECUTIVE EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT IS GOING TO INFORM. THESE DECISIONS AS WELL GOING FORWARD -- AND AND THEN OUR OUR INNOVATION SPRINT -- IS ALSO GOING TO TO DO THAT THROUGH THE RFI SQUARED PRO PROCESS SO. THE THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT ARE REALLY FOCUSED ON ON GETTING US THE INFORMATION THAT WE NEED TO REALLY MEET THAT GOAL -- ONE TO THE BEST THAT WE CAN POSSIBLY -- GET FIDELITY WISE LOOKING INTO THE FUTURE A BUT I DIDN'T HEAR THOUGH -- BUILDING CODES AND LAND USE. BECAUSE IT'S SORT OF JUST. THERE'S A LOT OF THEM IN A LOCAL JURISDICTIONS OBVIOUSLY HAVE. PRIMARY AUTHORITY ON A LOT OF THOSE QUESTIONS BUT IS A YEAR THINK INTO THE THEY DO AND THE REASON YOU DIDN'T HEAR ME SAY IT IS BECAUSE I I GLOSSED OVER I AM SORRY NO NO NO I I'M JUST BECAUSE WE WE ARE VERY MUCH OKAY AGED IN. LAND USE PLANNING AS WELL -- WE HAVE -- STAFF SINCE -- TWO THOUSAND TWELVE WE BUILT A LAND USE PLANNING. A GROUP AND WE ARE WORKING WITH -- LOCAL GOVERNMENT -- YOU KNOW IF THE AT THE COUNTY LEVEL -- TO INCREASE THEIR SAFETY ELEMENT -- COMPLIANCE WITH AND AND THEN -- INTEGRATE. THOSE. YOU BUILDING CODE ELEMENTS AND AND THEN ALSO INFRASTRUCTURE ELEMENTS THAT ARE KEY TO RESILIENT COMMUNITIES. I WOULD JUST -- I WOULD OFFER. ASSISTANCE AS YOU GO FORWARD ON MY AND I'M SURE MANY OTHER MEMBERS HERE IF WHAT COMES BACK -- SAFE FROM THE UTILITIES FOR THEIR WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLANS ISN'T IMAGINATIVE ENOUGH OR IF THEY'RE IN TOO MUCH OF A FOXHOLE FRANKLY RIGHT NOW TO THINK AHEAD. WHERE THEIR BALANCE SHEETS ARE THREATENED OR THEY MAY NOT KNOW IT DO THEY EVEN WANT TO BE IN THE PROCUREMENT BUSINESS AT ALL WE'RE HEARING SOME OF THEM DON'T -- IT THERE THERE'S SORT OF AN INHERENTLY DEFENSIVE POSTURE RIGHT NOW AND SO I'LL BE CURIOUS TO SEE WHAT THOSE PLANS LOOK LIKE BUT I THINK. THERE MAY BE SOME THINGS THAT THEY JUST CAN'T EVEN DO ON THEIR OWN AND THAT THE STATE MAY HAVE TO COME UP WITH SOME CREATIVE NEW WAYS. TO TO TO CUT THAT RISK BACK MAY I WONDER. YOU KNOW WE LOST ALL COMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE IN A HUGE. SWATH OF TERRITORY DOWN LA VENTURA COUNTY --% WHICH AFFECTED BOTH YOUR FOLKS ON THE GROUND AS WELL AS RESIDENTS TRY TO DEAL WITH EVACUATION -- IT'S A SINGLE POINT OF FAILURE REALLY THAT WE'RE SEEING WHERE. BACKUP POWERS MAYBE NOT THERE OR THE THE INFRASTRUCTURES GETTING BURNT DOWN INDIRECTLY GIVE THE DUDE YOU JUST CAN YOU MAKE A COMMENT SORT OF ON WHAT YOU SAW -- THROUGH THAT EXPERIENCE AND MAYBE SOME LESSONS WE LEARNED FROM THAT. WELL I'M JUST AN AIRY I GOT I GUESS THIS FOCUS ON SOMETHING THAT REALLY IS CRITICAL TO ALL OF US NOW AND AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT THE PUBLIC IS -- DEPENDED UPON. AND SOMETHING MYERS POINT WITH A LATE MORNING AND THAT IS. CELL PHONES AND AND YOU KNOW WHEN YOU BREAK IT DOWN TO THAT LEVEL THAT PEOPLE ARE LIVE AND LIVE OFF OF THE CELL PHONES AND GET UP THEIR INFORMATION OFFER THOSE. THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT PROVIDES DATA INTO THE CELL PHONES THAT INFORMATION MOVING THE THE SIGNALS FOR MARTIN WARNING -- ACTUALLY CRITICAL TO HAVE THAT FOR GOING TO DEPEND A FOR FOR PUTTING ALL OUR EGGS IN YOU KNOW TO THE TO THE DEGREE INTO THAT BASKET WE NEED TO HAVE THAT. SYSTEM RESILIENT NOW. NOT EVERYTHING THE GOVERNMENT AS A CONTROL EVERYTHING SOME OF THIS IS PRIVATE SECTOR RIGHT IN THE CASE OF IN CASE OF OUR CELL SITES WHICH WHICH THE CELL SITES ARE JUST FOR MOVING ALERT MORNING WE WERE USING THAT -- TO BE ABLE TO SHARE INFORMATION AMONGST ALL THE PUBLIC SAFETY AGENCIES WE ARE MOVING. TO A BABY A PLATFORM -- WHERE YOU'RE BROADBAND BEING RELATED TO THE INTER OPERABILITY BROADBAND THE CAPABILITY REQUIRES THAT? THAT INFRASTRUCTURE SUPPORT SO. IN THE CASE OF THE OF YOUR FIRE CENTER -- YOU KNOW. WHO FOR EXAMPLE? THE FIRE BROUGHT DOWN SOMETHING LIKE TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY SITES OF CELL SITES THAT WERE CRITICAL AND IT'S NOT JUST THE SITE TO COMING DOWN BUT THE BUT THE BACK CALL. THE FIBER IN AND SO. WHEREAS WE COLLECTIVELY APPROACHES IS NOT JUST FOR US BUT WE NEED TO INCORPORATE AS I MENTIONED. EARLIER -- SHOW OR ON MORE LIKE ABOUT THE ENGAGING INSURANCE COMPANIES -- TWENTY ONE FIGHT EFFORT WE NEED TO BRING IN -- OUR TELECOM PARTNERS EXCEPT WE NEED TO BUILD PUBLIC SAFETY GRADE. LEVEL RESILIENCY INTO THAT AND WE NEED TO HAVE BACKUP SYSTEMS IF IF IF THAT SITE NEEDS TO BE NOT IS DEFENSIVELY. CLEARED BUT YOU TO HAVE A BATTERY OR GENERATOR BACK UP WE NEED TO KNOW WE NEED TO KNOW THAT WE CAN COUNT ON THAT YOURSELF. TO ALL THE PUBLIC -- ACCORDINGLY SO THIS IS A BIG. BIG PIECE OF A COLLECTIVELY BETWEEN THEM THE CAMPFIRE IN THE WALLS THE FIRE SOMETHING LIKE FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE SITES THAT WENT OFF LINE AND AND THEN THE CHALLENGE COMES WITH. TELECOMS HAVING TO RESPOND MOBILE UNITS BUT THEN I WAS HAVING TO TURN TO GOVERNMENT SYSTEMS ARE TO OUR MILITARY PARTNERSHIP THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THIS AND IT'S NOT UNIQUE TO TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN FIRES TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN FIRES. WERE JUST AS BAD AND AND SO WE THAT'S A BIG DEAL BECAUSE WE BECAUSE OF FOR DOING EVACUATION ORDERS. IN A TIMELY FASHION OUT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO COUNT ON THOSE -- AND SAYS WE DON'T CONTROL ALL THAT IT HAS TO BE A PARTNERSHIP OR THEIR MINIMUM STANDARDS THOUGH THAT. WE AS A STATE IMPOSE ON THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS DID IN TERMS OF WHAT. WHAT THEY HOW HOW RESILIENT THEY HAVE TO BE RIGHT NOW IS THAT PRETTY DISCRETIONARY -- WHO ARE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE DOES PROVIDE? GUIDELINES FOR THEM -- TO TO AND BUT IT SOME. OTHER COMPLEXITIES WITHIN THE BOOKING OF OVERSIGHT YOU KNOW FROM FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE STATE -- SO WE WERE WE CAN -- AND IT'S NOT LIKE THEY DON'T WANT TO DO IT BUT IT'S A IT COMES DOWN -- TO SETTING UP PRIORITY BASED UPON COST AND GETTING OUT AND AND GETTING THAT DONE BUT WOULD YOU SAY I MEAN AS YOU'RE DEVELOPING THIS. BOLD NEW STRATEGIC PLAN A KALIFORNIA IN SOME OF YOUR INVENTORY I MEAN DO YOU EVEN HAVE THE INFORMATION OF WHERE OUR VULNERABILITIES ARE RIGHT NOW WITH THE STATE OF STATE. EVERY SINGLE CELL TOWER IS IN THE STATE I MEAN IS THAT IS THAT DATA. IS AVAILABLE TO YOU I THINK WE HAVE A PART AYE MIKE MIKE I GIVE YOU A 100% YEAH BUT I'M I'M ALMOST POSITIVE A PRETTYGOOD IDEA TO OUR PUBLIC SAFETY I MEAN WE CAN KNOW. WHERE A LOT OF THE HIVE OWN ABILITIES ARE BUT? THE INDUSTRY ITSELF GOING TO KNOW REALLY THE BEST AND THAT'S AGAIN -- AND WE BRING THEM INTO THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTER DURING EMERGENCIES TO BE ABLE -- TO TO OF GET THAT BUT THAT THERE'S THERE'S A LOT MORE IN THAT AREA THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE ACTUALLY BEFOE LA OR DID YOU JUST SAID DO YOU GUYS HAVE A COMMENT ON ON THIS THIS SAYS. STRATEGIC PLANNING QUESTION AND ANY ADVICE ME YOU GUYS ARE YOU ALL FOLLOWING THAT AND OTHER THINGS THAT WE SHOULD BE DOING TO HELP MAKE SURE THAT THEY CAN BE. AS COMPREHENSIVE AS THEY NEED TO BE AND INTERFACE AND ALL THE OTHER AGENCIES I MEAN. AND WE CAN HAVE MORE DETAILED AND COMMENTS FOR YOU AS WE GO THROUGH THE SUB COMMITTEE PROCESS I THINK WE AT THIS POINT JUST WANTED TO SORT OF RAISE THIS IDEA OF YOU MIGHT WANT TO START WITH AN ASSESSMENT OF WHERE THE CAPACITY IS AND WHERE THE GAPS ARE. AND AND IT YOU'RE ALSO GOING TO WANT TO THINK ABOUT HOW BROADLY DO YOU GO WITH IT AND YOU START BRINGING IN THESE OTHER THINGS LIKE YOU KNOW UTILITIES AND PREVENTION. AND I THINK THERE'S A LOT THAT YOU CAN DO JUST BETWEEN CAL FIRE IN -- YES ON THIS SORT OF DIRECT FIRE SUPPRESSION RESPONSE TIME AS YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT ADDING FIRE ENGINES AND HELICOPTERS AND AN AIRCRAFT IN MUTUAL AID RESOURCES. TO LOOK AT AND YOU KNOW WAIT WAIT WE'RE IN WHAT CASES DOESN'T MAKE THE MOST SENSE TO ADD A CAL FIRE ENGINE VERSES MORE MUTUAL AID RESOURCES AND THAT SORT OF THING AND SO. IT IS SOMETHING THAT YOU MAY WANT TO BE THINKING MORE BROADLY THAN JUST WITHIN CAL FIREON AND HOW THAT THAT THAT THAT SORT OF ASSESSMENT WOULD BE COORDINATED -- BUT YOU'RE GONNA WANT TO THINK ABOUT HW BROAD YOU GO BECAUSE IF YOU MAKE IT SO HUGE AND THAT'S GOING TO TAKE YEARS AND AND AND IS IT GONNA HAVE THE LEVEL OF DETAIL YOU NEED TO REALLY INFORM. SOME OF THESE BUDGETARY DECISIONS WERE YOU THINKING OF PREVENTION AND FIRE RESPONSE AND AND AND STAFF AND EQUIPMENT FOR CALIFORNIA SO I MEAN AS IT MISTER ONLY YOU SAID. THING IN NEAR TERM AND LONG TERM THEN. KEY HERE RIGHT SO HELPING MAKE SURE THE CAL FIRE NO YES HAVE. THE THE THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO GET THE JOB DONE TO GET JUST SURVIVE THE YEAR. HOPEFULLY PREVENT MORE PEOPLE FROM DYING OR MORE WHOLESOME IN LAWS BUT THEN ALSO TRYING TO GET SOME. GOING IT'S GOING TO BE. REALLY REALLY SCOPED OUT WHERE WE CAN ACTUALLY DRIVE LONGER TERM POLICY OVER ON THE GRID. OVERALL OUR COMMUNICATINS INFRASTRUCTURE MINIS HAS THINGS BETTER USE IT TAKES. DECADES BUT WE JUST GOT ACCELERATE THIS IS FAST WE CAN'T HEAR AND SQUEEZED INTO. FIVE YEARS OR TO SPRINTER WHAT WHATEVER THAT LOOKS LIKE BUT LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH YOU ON THAT EFFORT. AND WOULD LOVE IT SOME POINTED TO DRILL DOWN A LITTLE FURTHER ALSO ON YOUR YOUR NEW VEGETATION MANAGEMENT PROGRAMMATIC HE I ARE I KNOW THAT JUST WAS RELEASED -- SO WE WANTED WE WANT TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOU FEDERAL RESERVE MY REMARKS FOR LATER SO. THANK YOU YET -- THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- THANK YOU AND YOUR STAFF FOR SETTING UP THIS HEARING AND FOR ALL OF THE EXPERTS WHO'VE BEEN PARTICIPATING SO FAR -- ONE IN. FIVE I HAVE A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS AROUND OUR STRATEGIC PLANNING AND OTHER THINGS BUT I JUST WANTED -- TO COUNTER DOOR VICE CHAIRS ASSERTION THAT ARE IN MADE FIRE CREWS ARE LESS RELIABLE I DON'T THINK WE'VE THERE'S ANY EVIDENCE THUS FAR. THAT THOSE CREWS ARE LESS RELIABLE AND I THINK IN FACT. WE HAVE RELIED ON THEM QUITE EXTENSIVELY. IN ALL OF THE FIRE RESPONSES ENDS NOT ONLY IN THE FIRE RESPONSES. LAST COUPLE OF REALLY TRAGIC YEARS BUT ALSO IN OUR OF FIRE SUPPRESSION. ACTIVITIES IN A AND I DON'T KNOW IF -- T. POOR IF YOU WONDER REFERENCE THAT IT ALL BUT AS FAR AS A QUALITY OF A CREW -- ARE ARE IN MAKE CREWS -- INDIVIDUALLY EACH ONE OF THEM IS A TYPE ONE HIGH QUALITY CREW. AND THE FIGHT FIRE ALONG SIDE. HOT SHOTS AND ALL THE ALL THE HARDEST WORKING -- FIREFIGHTERS OUT THERE. THERE THERE LED BY OUR OUR CALIFORNIA CAPTAINS LETTER THAT ARE LEADING THEM. BUT THEY ARE VERY HARD WORKING -- CREWMEMBERS. EACH AND EVERYONE OF THEM NOW. THE IT'S KIND OF COMES -- TO HOW MANY WE HAVE IN THE SYSTEM AND RIGHT NOW WE'RE THOUSAND INMATES SHORT OF OUR OF OUR NEED TO HAVE ALL OF OUR CREWS COVERED AND THAT'S THAT'S WHERE THE WEAKNESSES WERE RELATED TO INMATES IT'S IN THAT. OF OF THE SYSTEM TO SUPPLY US WITH ELIGIBLE INMATES -- TO TO THE PROGRAM SO THE CCC CREWS ABSOLUTELY THEY ARE. EQUALLY AS AS STRONG AND HARD WORKING AS INDIVIDUAL CRUZ IT'S JUST THE THE CAPACITY OF AN A NUMBERS ISSUE BUT CERTAINLY NOT A THE LIABILITY ISSUE -- SO THEN I I EIGHT I THINK. ONE OF THE STRUGGLES THAT FOR THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD BE. IS GIVEN THE THE CHALLENGES WERE FACING [inaudible] KNOWING THAT. THIS PRESENCE OF FIRE AND VERY CATASTROPHIC FIRES IS GONNA BE CONTINUAL. WHERE DO WE PUT? OUR RESOURCES AND I APPRECIATE. THAT -- FROM CAL FIRES POINT OF VIEW YOU DON'T DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN. THE FORESTER THE WILD FIRE FIRE VERSUS THOSE THAT HAVE OCCURRED IN OUR WILD LANDS URBAN INTERFACE -- BUT I THINK. I AND I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR YOUR OPINIONS BUT GIVEN THAT WE HAVE FROM A FIRE ECOLOGY POINT OF VIEW. NOT MANAGED OUR FOREST LANDS. IN A WAY THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN OPTIMAL FOR FIRE REDUCTION FOR A VERY LONG TIME. AND IT SEEMS AND ALSO SO MUCH OF THOSE THAT THAT ACREAGE IS. FEDERAL. THAT TO ACCOMPLISH THE TYPE OF FIRE PREVENTION ACTIVITY IN THOSE LANDS. IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME WOULD BE VERY VERY DIFFICULT. NOW. THE OBVIOUSLY THE IMPACT OF THOSE FIRES SO THE MENDOCINO COMPLEX FIRE WAS MANY MORE ACRES THAN THE OTHER FIRES THAT WE'VE EXPERIENCED. SO IT WAS VERY BAD FROM A CARBON POINT OF VIEW IN VERY BAD FOR ME -- QUALITY POINT OF VIEW THOUGH MAYBE AIR QUALITY NOT AS BAD AS THE URBAN -- INTERFACE ONCE BECAUSE YOU'RE PUTTING A DIFFERENT SET OF OF PARTICULATE MATTER AND CHEMICALS INTO THE YEAR WHEN YOU'RE BURNING THINGS THAT HUMANS HAVE STARTED TO AFFECT VERSES. OF TREES AND SCRUB AND SUCH ON BUT THE COST TO US FOR IN TERMS OF PROPERTY. IN TERMS OF ECONOMIC LOSSES IN CLEAN UP ND OF COURSE HUMAN% LIVES IS FAR GREATER. IN OUR INTERFACE AREAS. AND THE THE DEFENSIBLE SPACE WHILE IT IS PRIVATE PROPERTY IN MANY CASES IT SEEMS LIKE WE MIGHT HAVE MORE OPPORTUNITY. TO DO MORE WORK TO ME TO LESSEN. THE FIRES THERE THEN. PUTTING OVER EMPHASIS ON BE -- FORCE MANAGEMENT AND I I'D LIKE TO HEAR -- I'D LIKE SOME SPEED. THIS DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A CONCLUSION BY ANY MEANS OUR WE WE HAVE LIMITED RESOURCES SO WHAT IS OUR BEST FROM A STRATEGIC PLANNING POINT OF VIEW WHAT IS THE BEST PLACE. TO DIRECT THOSE RESOURCES AND I'M GONNA START THE ANSWER WITH IT'S COMPLICATED -- A REALLY IS -- BECAUSE WELL IN THAT THAT INTERFACE AREA WE HAVE A LOT MORE POINTS OF NEED OF PROTECTION. THE COST AND HIGHER COSTS TO DO SO AND HIGHER COST OF LOS. ALL ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE ARE THERE -- AND AND THAT IS NEEDS TO BE -- A ONE OF OUR TOP PRIORITIES -- THE THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS IS HOW DO WE HOW DO WE START TO GET -- TO WHAT YOU REFERRED TO PREVIOUSLY -- A MORE HEALTHY FOREST ECOSYSTEM STATE. MORE OF AN ABILITY FOR OUR FOREST LANDS TO BE ABLE. TO HANDLE NATURAL AND NON NATURAL STARTS OF FIRES AND AND ALLOW MAY BE SOME MORE ACRES TO BE BURNED IN A HEALTHY. WAY -- WHICH SHOULD TO ALL OF THE FIRST COMPARED. TO THE V. FOUR WE AREA YES WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE AND INTERMIX AND YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THAT'S AND THAT'S PRIMARILY WHERE ARE OUR ENGINES ARE. CURRENTLY AND OUR OUR ASSESSMENT WILL LOOK AT THEY NEED -- TO ADD ENGINES IN IN THOSE KIND OF WE WE OR INTERMIX AREAS BECAUSE REALLY THAT IS SO I'M THINKING OF PREVENTION NOW VERSUS JUST I UNDERSTAND AND THEY AND THEY ARE PREVENTION OKAY SO THOSE THOSE ENGINES ARE THERE. TO SUPPRESS FIRES AND THEN WHEN THEY'RE NOT SUPPRESSING FIRES THERE PREVENTION REMEMBER AND I AND I AND AND I'M GONNA WORK ON ON ON KIND OF MORE ARTICULATING THE THE PERCENTAGES OF OF TEIR THAT WORKLOAD THAT THAT THEY'RE PROVIDING -- IN THAT -- FOR YOU FOR THE FOR THE FUTURE -- BUT WELL WELL WE WHAT WE'RE WORKING ON ALL OF THESE THINGS -- AND AND THEN I'M GONNA COME BACK TO CRUISE ON THAT. SO THERE IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF WHY WE NEED MORE OF OUR OUR FREE FIREFIGHTER CREWS WHETHER THEY'RE THE CCC WHETHER THEIR FUTURE CAL FIRE FIRE FIGHTER CREW. THOSE ARE THE CREWS THAT CAN WORK IN THOSE INTERFACE OR IF THOSE INTERMIX AREAS WE WE WE ARE RIGHT NOW IT IT'S IT'S NOT SAFE TO PUT INMATES IN SOME SITUATIONS. AND SO WE NEED THOSE FOR FREE FIREFIGHTERS IN IN THE MIX IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT WORK AND THAT'S GROWING THAT PROGRAM WILL ALLOW US -- WORK IN THAT THAT WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE AND URBAN INTERMIX AREA -- TO DO MORE OF THE PREVENTION WORK -- DOING PRESCRIBED FIRE IN THOSE AREAS IS VERY TEDIOUS BECAUSE ESPECIALLY UNTIL WE DO ENOUGH OF THIS OTHER TYPE OF WORK TO GET TO A STATE WHERE WE CAN. PUT FIRE ON THE GROUND SAFELY -- AND WE HAVE A COMMUNITY THAT'S GOING TO ACCEPT FIRE ON THE GROUND -- THEN. WE'LL GET TO THAT AS WELL THESE OUR FUTURE STATES AND I THINK FIVE YEARS MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT -- SHORT SENATOR STERN ON ON TURNING THE THE TABLES BUT WE'RE GONNA DO EVERYTHING WE POSSIBLY CAN. TO TO SHORTEN THAT TIME LINE -- BUT WE'RE WE REALLY ARE TALKING ABOUT DECADES THIS IS THIS IS A SEA CHANGE AND I THINK YOU'VE YOU'VE HIT ON IT WITH THE THE PREVENTION AND THE KIND OF THE PRE FIRE AND AND MANAGEMENT OF AND FOCUSING ON THE AREAS WHERE WE'RE GOING TO PROTECT THAT. THE PEOPLE FIRST BUT WE ALSO NEED TO LOOK AT THE HEALTH OF THE FOREST AND THAT'S PART OF IT YOU'VE BEEN FOCUSING SO FAR AND WHAT [inaudible] THE STATE. AGENCIES WOULD DO AND I WONDER IF WE SHOULDN'T BE LOOKING MORE. AT WHAT WE SHOULD BE EXPECTING FROM OUR PRIVATE PROPERTY OWNERS. AND FROM POTENTIALLY OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND OTHERS -- AND I SAY THAT AS REPRESENTATIVE% OF THE AREA WHERE BEFORE. THE TUBS AND CAMPFIRE HAD THE WORST FIRE WITH THE MOST LOSS OF STRUCTURES AND LYFT WHICH WAS THE OAKLAND BERKELEY TUNNEL FIRE. AND WE STILL HAVE A CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE WE HAVE MANY PROPERTY OWNERS WHO ARE NOT WE HAVE. LAWS AND RULES EACH OF OUR JURISDICTIONS. THAT ARE IMPACTEDOF LAWS RULES AROUND DEFENSIBLE SPACE. AND BUILD OF OPPRESSION SUCH AND YET. IT IT'S YEAH EXACTLY TO THE IT MAY BE BETTER THAN OTHER PLACES I DON'T KNOW NOT FULLY. NOT WHERE WE SHOULD BE. AND OF COURSE. WE ALLOWED FOR THE COMPLETE REBUILT. IN ALL THE AREAS THAT WERE WHERE AND THAT FIRE WAS NOT THE FIRST FIRE SO IT -- BUT I HAVE A TWO OTHER COMMENTS ABOUT SOME MATERIAL THAT WAS IN OUR DOCUMENTS BUT JUST ANY OTHER. ANY FROM OUR PANELIST ON WHETHER WE SHOULD BE PUTTING SOME MORE. EXPECTATIONS ON TO ASSIST US. YOU WANTED TO TAKE THE FIRST -- YES WELL I I'M JUST TO SAY I LIKE I SAID I AGREE WITH YOU ON THIS THIS HAS TO BE -- A WHOLE COMMUNITY APPROACH IT IT'S NOT JUST A CAL FIRE ISSUE RIGHT OR STATE ISSUE. YOU KNOW WE PUSH OUT HAZARD MITIGATION GRANTS TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS -- IN GENERAL AS AS A STATE IS YOUR RISKIEST CALIFORNIA AS WE WE NEED TO REINFORCE WHAT I CALL CULTURE PREPAREDNESS THAT THAT'S GOING TO BE ACROSS ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT RIGHT. AND AND IT SPEAKS TO WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT AFTER THE OAKLAND HILLS FIRE IF YOU DRIVE UP IN THE SAME HILLS TODAY. IT'S IT'S GOT A WEIRD TO THINK THAT YOU WE WILL BE BACK AT THE SAME PLACE YEAH PRETTY FIRE AFTER A NINETY TWO PEOPLE SO I I THINK THAT THAT. REALLY NEEDS TO BE ALL YOU KNOW JUST LIKE OUR SAYS CENTER STERN -- PUBLIC PRIVATE NON GOVERNMENTAL AND WE DON'T HAVE TO SOLVE IT TODAY. IS WHAT. ARE AGENCIES WOULD RECOMMEND THAT IF THERE'S SOMETING THAT WE NEED TO ENACT BECAUSE YES IT'S A AND I DON'T MEAN THIS IS NOT. IS LOVELY TO SAY WE NEED THIS WHOLE. PRIVATE PUBLIC PARTNERSHIP EVERYBODY ON BUT BUT WHAT IS IT THAT WE NEED TO DO WHEN WE THE DEFINITION OF CRAZINESS AS THEY SAY IS TO CONTINUE TO DO THE SAME THING THAT DOESN'T. PRODUCE THE RESULTS SO. ANY RECOMMENDATIONS AN INSIGHT ON THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO US AND THAT BRINGS UP MY NEXT POINT WHICH IS WHEN I LOOK AT THIS DOCUMENT. WHERE WE ARE GIVEN? THE DATA THAT SHOWS THAT. FROM. NINETEEN NINETY TO TWENTY TEN DEVELOPMENT WITHIN OUR WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE GROUP 20%. AND A COURSES I JUST START YOU STATED EVEN IN MY AREA IT WAS QUICKLY REBUILT. BUT THEN ADDITIONALLY ON PAGE. FOUR OF OUR DOCUMENTS IT SAYS THAT ACCORDING TO A UCLA STUDY AN ESTIMATED ONE MILLION NEW HOMES ARE EXPECTED TO BE BUILT IN THE HIGH RISK WILDFIRES ZONES AND I'M SURE. THAT THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE THREE PLACEMENT OF THE ONES WHO WERE JUST BURKE BURN OUT. AND I'M LIKE OKAY AT WHAT POINT DO WE THAT. WE MAY HAVE TO DO IT DIFFERENTLY. AND THAT'S WITH EVERY BIT OF COMPASSION TO FOLKS THAT. HAVE YOU KNOW. LOST THEIR LOST LOVED ONES LOST PROPERTY LOSS IT'S JUST THAT WE I MEAN IF WE LOOK FOR EXAMPLE AND THE CAMPFIRE. THERE ALREADY WAS REPORT THAT. WHEN THE POPULATION THERE WAS? WAS A THIRD OF WHAT IT HAD BEEN. THAT THE THERE WAS ALREADY ALL OF THE DATA TO SHOW THE DANGER SIGNALS OF THE FACT THAT THERE WAS ONLY ONE ROAD. THROUGH THE AREA AND THE DANGER SIGNALS NOT ONLY OF ACCESS FOR EMERGENCY PERSONNEL BUT THE ABILITY FOR PEOPLE. IN THE EMERGENCY TO BE ABLE TO GET OUT. SO I THINK WE WE HAVE. TO WE CAN'T JUST BE IN REACTIVE MODE WE'VE GOT TO PUT SOME THINGS INTO PLACE. TO HELP MINIMIZE THIS EXPOSURE COST AND AND REAL CONSEQUENCES. PEOPLE LOST LIVES. A REAL RELATED TO A LOT OF THAT IS LAND USE PLANNING -- AND IT'S IT'S WHAT WE CAN DO AT THE STATE LEVEL TO HELP INFORM. THE THE LOCALS AS I MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY WE HAVE WE HAVE THIS GROUP -- OUR LAND USE PLANNING GROUP THAT IS WORKING WITH ALL OF THE COUNTIES -- AND AND IT'S TAKEN SOME TIME BUT THE ACCEPTANCE OF OF THAT GROUP HAS HAS GROWN. EXPONENTIALLY IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS FOR OBVIOUS REASONS. AND WORKING WITH THE BOARD OF FORESTRY IN REVIEWING OF OF THE SAFETY ELEMENT. OF OF GENERAL PLANS AS THE GENERAL PLANS ARE BEING REVIEWED AND UPDATED IS KEY TO THAT BUT THEN ON THE RECOVERY. THAT GETS BACK IT'S TEDIOUS AND HANDED THERE IS OFTEN REQUESTS FOR WAIVERS. FROM SOME OF THESE VERY RULES AND AND THINGS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET INTO GENERAL PLANS. THAT ARE THE BEST PRACTICES TO SAVE PROPERTY -- ANY AND IT'S EIGHT IT DOES INCREASE THE COST OF OF REBUILDING AND SO. THERE'S THERE'S A BALANCING ACT THERE THAT THAT REALLY PLAYS OUT AT A LOCAL LEVEL THAT THAT IS PART OF THIS EQUATION AS WELL I THINK. WHEN THERE'S NO GUARANTEE WE WOULD ENACT BUT I THINK IT'S WORTH IT FOR US TO GET RECOMMENDATIONS AS TO WASTE BECAUSE THIS THE IMPACT TO THE STATE IS HUGE AND HAS? STATE LAWMAKERS WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT -- MY pFINAL QUESTION IN POINT IS THERE'S REFERENCE IN OUR DOCUMENTS AROUND THE NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM. AND I'M SURE WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT THAT MORE OTHER TIMES BUT IN ADDITION TO OUR NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM BEING INADEQUATE. OUR EMERGENCY ALERT SYSTEM WE ENCOUNTERED IN ALL THE FIRES WAS INADEQUATE AND THAT WE RELY PRIMARILY ON LOCAL JURISDICTIONS SOME OF WHOM USE -- ANTIQUATED SYSTEM SOME OF OR ARE YOU KNOW MORE EFFECTIVE. BUT I WAS IN CHILE IN NOVEMBER. AND THEY USE A SYSTEM. SIMILAR TO OUR AMBER ALERT WHERE IT OVERRIDES CELL PHONES AND IT IT. BASICALLY ALERTS PEOPLE THROUGH THEIR CELL PHONE WHETHER IT'S ON OR OFF. OF WHEN THERE IS AN EMERGENCY IN THEIR AREA AND AND WHAT THEY NEED TO DO WHETHER THEY NEED TO EVACUATE STAND PLACE OR WHAT HAVE YOU. AND I WONDERED IF THE STATED CONSIDERED. DEVELOPING SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND WE HAVE THE AMBER ALERT. TECHNOLOGY ALREADY IT ALREADY EXISTS WE ALL GET THOSE. WHY WE COULDN'T DO STATEWIDE? EMERGENCY ALERTS IN A SIMILAR FASHION. SO -- YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT -- SOME WEEKS -- AMBER ALERTS ON A IS IS THE SAME SYSTEM THAT WE ARE PROPOSING IN THE GUIDELINES -- THAT ALL JURISDICTIONS IN THE STATE. UTILIZED -- IT'S CALLED WE AS THE WIRELESS EMERGENCY ALERT SYSTEM -- IT IS A FEDERAL SYSTEM DEVELOPED AND AND AND STATE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. PLUG INTOTHAT SYSTEM -- IS CONTINUE TO EVOLVE AND AND GET BETTER -- EVEN SINCE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN FIRES -- AND AND IT IS THE SIX SYSTEM THAT THEY WILL DO MATTER WHERE YOU ARE IF YOU'RE TRAVELING FOR NOT FROM THE AREA BUT YOU'RE TRAVELING THROUGH. ITS BASED UPON OUT OF A POLY GONE THEY THEY THE GEO FENCE IN THE AREA AND THEN THEY'LL PUSH OUT A MESSAGE. OF WHAT WE WANT STILL LOW IS BECAUSE EVENTS ARE HAPPENING. IMMEDIATELY WE WE WANT AUTHORITIES TO MAIN IN THAT LEADERSHIP ROLE OF BEING ABLE TO PUT THOSE. ALERTS AND WARNINGS OUT OF THE STATE IS HERE AS A AS A BACK UP BUT THIS IS REALLY LOCAL WHAT THE HOW AMBER ALERT WORKS TOO WELL AMBLER TO LITTLE DIFFERENTLY BECAUSE IT'S A CENTRAL LOCATION -- THAT'S RUN BY THE HIGHWAY PATROL AND THE HIGHER PATROL COP OUR VIRTUAL -- OKAY PUT THAT OUT SEE WHY TO ALL ITS DIVISIONS AND ACROSS THE BOARD ON THIS IS AND BECAUSE YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE WHEN THEY DO -- KIDNAPPINGS ARE THEY'RE MOVING SOMEBODY ACROSS THE STATE -- IT'S IT'S IT WORKS BETTER IN THAT FASHION THIS ONE IS MORE DESIGNED FOR WHAT'S HAPPENING. IMMEDIATELY ACTIVE SHOOTER FAST MOVING WILDFIRE HAZARDOUS MATERIALS INCIDENTS -- AND IT IS -- IT IS BUILT INTO THE NEW RELEASED THIS THIS NEXT WEEK. YOU'LL LET US KNOW IF IT NEEDS ANY KIND OF STATE. ACTION MORE WE'RE GONNA CAM WHERE WE WILL COME BACK TO YOU ON THAT FOR SURE THANK YOU THANK YOU. Q. AND SENATOR MCGUIRE. THANK YOU SO MUCH RENDON CHAIR UNETHICAL RAPID FIRE MANAGER THAT WORKS FOR YOU -- MARCH THIRTEENTH THERE'S GONNA BE JOINTLY JUST HAD A MEETING WITH DODD IN FIVE ALONG WITH NATURAL RESOURCES IN TERMS STERN ON ALL ISSUES OF BUILDING WITHIN THE WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE -- IN LOOKING AT NEW STANDARDS AND THEN WILL BE PROVIDING -- THAT WITH THE WILL BE THE WILD URBAN IN ON WHICH WE HIV GOVERNMENT IN. THANK YOU GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE -- AS WELL CENTER RESOURCES MARCH THIRTEENTH ON AND I THINK THAT AS CENTER STIR AND SKINNY CENTER SKINNER BRINGS UP SOME REALLY GOOD POINTS -- ON THAT ISSUE SO -- WERE IN THE FOCUSING ON THAT SENATE BILL -- EIGHT THREE THREE WHICH HAS BEEN FOCUSED RECEIVE ALERTS VIA SB EIGHT THREE THREE WILL BE DISTRIBUTED -- TRADITIONAL LAND LINES -- ON ALERT TO YOUR CELL PHONE ON ANY. NGUYEN IMPORTANT PIECES IS NO LONGER AN OFTEN IT'S AN OPT OUT SYSTEM -- THROUGH EMERGENCY BROADCAST RADIO TELEVISION TELEVISION AND STATE HIGHWAY ELECTRONIC BILLBOARDS TO THERE'S GONNA BE FOR AND MEDIANS MEDIUMS THAT WILL BE -- THOSE ALERTS WE DISTRIBUTED ON ONE AGAIN SAY THANK YOU TO DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND OF COURSE TO THE GOVERNOR AND CAL FIRE FOR RECOMMENDING THIRTEEN ENGINES. THAT ARE IN -- IN THE BUDGET THIS YEAR OUT WITH CAL FIRE VERY GRATEFUL FOR THAT -- WHERE THE LA I WAS FOCUSING IS A LONG TERM PLAN BUT WHEN IT COMES TO BOTH FIRE PREVENTION AS WELL AS FIRE RESPONSE I LOOK I THINK THAT MAKES SENSE? BOTTOM LINE IS THIS -- AND I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO GET THAT THE CHIEF'S COMMENTS ON THIS AS WELL. WE HAVE YET. TO GET BACK TO WHERE WE WERE IN -- NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE AS FAR AS THE THE LEVEL THE ENGINES IN THE STATE. AND THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK ABOUT FIRE FIGHT THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK ABOUT PTSD OF FIREFIGHTERS YOU TALK DIRECTLY WITH. THOSE WHO ARE IN THE RANKS OF CALIFORNIA -- THERE ARE OUT ON STRESS THEIR OUT AN INJURY -- BOTH EMOTIONAL AND PHYSICAL. IN THE BEST WAY TO BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH THAT IS TO BE ABLE TO GET THEIR RANKS UP TO WHERE WE WERE IN THE SEVENTIES -- AND THAT IS WHY WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO MOVE TO THAT THIRTY ONE NUMBER. I'M ALSO REALISTIC AND I AND I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THIS AND WILL LOOK TO THE CHIEF ON THIS I ALSO KNOW -- FOR WILL SOON WE CAN'T DO IT ALL IN ONE YEAR. MEANING A TAKES. X. AMOUNT OF TIME TO BE ABLE TO GET A NEW ENGINE I'D TO BE ABLE TO STAFF UP -- IN SO WE NEED TO BE ABLE I THINK WE NEED TO BE A TO SEE A PLAN OVER THE NEXT TWENTY FOUR TO THIRTY SIX MONTHS. TO MINIMUM TO BE ABLE TO GET TO THAT NUMBER OF THIRTY ONE THE LARGEST MOST DESTRUCTIVE AND DEADLIEST WILDFIRES IN THE STATE HAVE BEEN TAKING PLACE SINCE. TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AND IS UNACCEPTABLE THAT WE CAN'T GET BACK UP THROUGH THE RANKS AND THE LEVEL OF NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE SOME ACCEPTABLE -- AND I DO WANNA COMPLEMENT THOUGH -- WHERE THE GOVERNOR HAS BEEN AS FAR AS MOVING US TOWARDS THAT ONE A COMMON GOVERNOR BROWN AS WELL? AND WE NEED TO BE A GO FOR THIS YEAR. FROM OUR NUMBERS FROM LAST YEAR'S DISCUSSION IT'S GONNA MEAN EIGHTY FOUR TO EIGHTY SEVEN MILLION ONE TIME THAT'S TO BE ABLE TO PURCHASE THE ENGINES AND AND TO BE ABLE -- TO HIRE THE STAFF ON GOING IT'S GOING TO BE ABOUT SIXTY TO SIXTY FIVE MILLION BUT THOSE ARE ALL THOSE ARE THOSE NUMBERS ARE TWELVE MONTHS OLD. BUT I THINK THEY'RE STILL PRETTY ACCURATE. IN GETTING BACK TO WHERE DIRECTOR DUTY AND MENTION REGARDS TO THE ISSUE OF THE 85% OF THOSE WERE COMING FROM MUTUAL AID. TO THE NORTH A FIRESTORM THREE HUNDRED FIRE ENGINES WERE REQUESTED IN THE FIRST TWELVE HOURS OF THE INCIDENT. A HUNDRED AND THIRTY ARRIVED. HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE WE HAVE A SYSTEM THAT IS THE GOLD STANDARD IN THE STATE AND WE HAVE A SYSTEM THAT IS STRESSED -- AND WE SIMPLY DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH BOOTS ON THE GROUND ERROR EQUIPMENT. I'M IT SO WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON THE LOCAL LEVEL AS WELL -- WE'LL JUST TAKE DOWN HERE MADAM CHAIR AND THEN ALSO IF IT'S OKAY VENTURE HAVE THAT THE CHIEF OF RESPOND INDOOR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- DO WANT TO SAY AGAIN THANK YOU TO THE GOVERNOR FOR PUTTING THAT SIX POINT SIX APPROXIMATELY AND BE ON THE FOCUS ON MENTAL HEALTH FOR THOSE FIREFIGHTERS AND IF WE NEED TO BETTER GO FURTHER AS WE GET I JUST MENTIONED. IN REGARDS TO THAT FIVE MILLION ONE TIME -- ON RESEARCH FOCUS ON FIRE FIGHTER HEALTH ON THE LONG TERM EXPOSURE FOR SMOKERS WELLS -- TOXIC CONDITIONS. THE OTHER ITEM THAT WAS DISCUSSED LAST YEAR AND I THINK THAT WE NEED TO BE A FOLLOW UP WITH -- GOVERNOR BROWN A IN HIS WISDOM STARTED OUTFITTING EACH CAL FIRE RATE WITH -- TRANSPONDERS TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHERE EACH TREE GAZING ANYONE TIME -- THE CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE THE ALWAYS THE VAST MAJORITY OF THOSE FIRE ENGINES THAT ARE RESPONDING TO A LARGE -- WHILE THEN FIRE IN SOONER COMING FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT. SO JUST LIKE WE HAD A CHALLENGE WITH THE POLLY KLAAS CASE WHERE -- LAW ENFORCEMENT WERE ON DIFFERENT CHANNELS AND I KNOW UNABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER I LOOK AT THIS THIS IS VERY SIMILAR ISSUE WE HAVE CAL FIRE WHO WAS ON ONE SYSTEM. BUT WE DON'T WE ARE TRACKING WHERE THOSE COMING IN FROM AROUND THE STATE I THINK WE NEED TO START MOVING. TOWARDS THAT -- WITH THOSE ENGINES AT LOCAL GUY AT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL. NINE ONE ONE IS A ANTIQUATED SYSTEM IN THE STATE IS ANTIQUATED WE'VE SEEN CHALLENGES -- WITH. WE SAW CHALLENGES AND CINNAMON CARRIES WE SUCH CHALLENGES IN -- IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IT'S TIME TO RIP THE BANDAID OFF AND FINALLY START INVESTING I APPRECIATE THE THE FIRST YEAR FUNDING. TO BE ABLE TO GET THIS STARTED BUT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE A DIFFICULT CONVERSATION BOTH DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS HAVE. FULLY FUNDING THE MODERNIZATION IN. NINE ONE ONE TIME. WE DO TRY LAST YEAR BY IN TRIED TO THE VERY LAST YOU A FEW HOURS OF A SESSION TO BE A TO GET IT DONE. AND THIS IS NOT A PARTISAN ISSUE -- AND WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO FOCUS IN ON THAT. THE LAST ITEM -- WILL SAY. IN I KNOW WE'RE GOING TO BE FOCUSING ON AB SEVENTY THREE NAY BE SEVENTY TWO NEXT WEEK -- BUT JUST AS A LITTLE BIT OF A WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT THE DISASTER RESPONSE EMERGENCY OPERATIONS ACCOUNT WHICH IS COMING BACK -- UNDER -- THE BILL. WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION NEXT WEEK IN REGARDS TO WHAT IS THE DEFINITION IS VERY BROAD OF IMMEDIATE POTENTIAL HAZARD AND THE REASON I BRING THAT UP IS. ESPECIALLY AFTER A WHILE IN FIRE WERE SEEN THIS -- IN CINEMA MEDINA LAKE IN NAPA A RUSSIAN DEBRIS WERE AT DEBRIS PHONE FLASH FLOODING IN IS THAT -- AS PART OF THE DEFINITION I KNOW WE DON'T NEED -- THE ANSWER HERE TODAY BUT THAT IS ITEM WOULD LIKE TO BE A FLAG FOR NEXT WEEK THANK YOU SO MUCH BEEN CHAIR IF IT'S ALRIGHT WITH THAT WOULD YOU PLEASE. OKAY -- AND I I WILL I WILL TALK TO THE NUMBERS AND TO THE TRAINING AND THE AND THE DEPLOYMENT TIMELINE -- THE ITEMS -- THAT YOU SENATOR BROUGHT UP RELATED TO THE ENGINES -- FIRST ONE POINT OF CLARIFICATION JUST STATE I'M IN A I'M A REITERATE SOMETHING MY PREDECESSOR. HAS ALSO STATED. ON THE RECORD AND TRUE -- FROM. FROM OUR RECORDS -- IT WE ARE A THIRTY THIRTY ONE ENGINES SHORTER. IN OUR INVENTORY THAN WE WERE -- THEN AND NOW. AND PART OF THAT IS IN THE IN THE INTERCEDING TIME -- IN THIS IN THE LATE SEVENTIES THE ORANGE COUNTY WENT AWAY -- TO A CONTRACT COUNTY AND EIGHT OF THOSE ENGINES THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY STATE. FUNDED ENGINES ARE STILL STATE FUNDED ENGINES BUT THEY'RE IN A CONTRACT COUNTY SO THAT BRINGS THE NUMBER TWO TWO AT TWENTY THREE NUMBER. THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH NOW WHAT I'VE SAID -- AND AND I I I BELIEVE -- AS MISTRAL ME SAID IS THAT IS A NO REGRETS STARTING POINT WE'VE WE'VE BEEN CLEAR TO THAT -- I AM VERY COMFORTABLE SAYING THAT WE NEED MORE THAN THAT AND AND I'M VERY COMFORTABLE SAYING THAT. THAT -- WE NEED TO GET BACK TO AT LEAST WHERE WE WERE IN NINETEEN SEVENTY AND PROBABLY BEYOND WHERE WE WERE IN. NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO IN END USER OLD NUMBERS AND CHIEF IF YOU DON'T MIND JUST CHIME IN ON THIS SO RIGHT NOW I THINK IT PEAK. OF THESE ARE MY NOTES FROM LAST YEAR YOU HAVE APPROXIMATELY THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY THREE SEASONAL AS WELL AS FULL TIME ENGINES ACROSS THE STATE IS THAT STILL GOOD ENOUGH. SO WHAT IS THAT IDEAL NUMBERED ENGINES THAT YOU'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO GET TO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN DIFFERENTIATE STAFFING AS FAR AS FULL TIME VERSUS SEASONAL BUT WHAT IS THAT NUMBER. YEAH I I CAN'T I CAN'T SPLIT THAT OUT AND THAT CAN BE PART OF OUR STRATEGIC PLANNING PROCESS THAT I WAS -- COVERING PREVIOUSLY -- I AM COMFORTABLE SAYING THAT IT'S GOING TO COME TO OR IT OR EXCEED THE NINETEEN SEVENTY LEVEL -- WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY THOUSAND ACRES -- FOR EACH ENGINE -- ACROSS THE STATE THEM THAT'S THAT'S KIND OF THE THE ROUGH NUMBER -- THAT EACH ENGINE IS PRETTY PROTECTING AND AND IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S VARIABLE OF COURSE BUT IF YOU IF YOU LOOK AT IT ACROSS THE STATE THAT'S ABOUT WHAT IT IS. AND THAT'S A LOT OF GROUND FOR EACH ENGINE. AND WE ARE THROUGH OUR ASSESSMENT -- ARE GOING TO DETERMINE WHERE WE NEED ADDITIONAL -- AND WHAT INFRASTRUCTURE MIGHT BE NEEDED -- TO TO HOUSE THOSE -- AS FAR AS DEPLOYMENT -- IF WE WERE -- TO LOOK AT THIRTY ONE ADDITIONAL ENGINES THAT WOULD. THIRTEEN OF THOSE WOULD BE INCLUDED IN THAT -- THIRTY ONE THAT'S APPROXIMATELY AN ADDITIONAL. THIRTY WEEKS OF OF TRAINING THAT WE WOULD NEED FOR THE STAFF THAT WOULD BE THE COMPANY OFFICERS ON ON THAT THE THE PERMANENT STAFF. AND THAT'S THIRTY THIRTY WEEKS THAT WE DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE -- ALLOCATED OUR IN OUR CALENDAR CALENDARS FULL OF A WITH TRAINING NEEDS WE COULD DIVERT AND AND CHANGE SOME OF OUR SO WE COULD PROBABLY REDUCE THE WOULD NEED SOME SOME -- TRAINING -- COMPONENTS -- IT IN THAT. PROBABLY LIMITED TERM POSITIONS TO DO THAT BUT WITHIN THE TWENTY FOUR AND THIRTY SIX I CAN GIVE YOU OF THAT MORE SPECIFICALLY BUT I I'M SURE WE COULD MEET THAT TIME FRAME -- TO EITHER PROBABLY THE THIRTY SIX FOR CERTAIN AND TWENTY FOUR IS LIKELY -- AND THEN THE I DON'T KNOW IF YOU ASKED FOR COMMENT BUT I WANTED TO SAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR SUPPORTING THE THE THE CONCEPT THAT WE'RE GOING FORWARD ON THE THE HEALTH AND WELLNESS OF OUR EMPLOYEES -- WE WE HAVE EMPLOYEES THAT IT THAT DO -- THEY DO A MISSION THAT THAT FEW DO AND OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT BROTHERS AND SISTERS ARE ABSOLUTELY A HUGE HELP IN OUR SYSTEM. BUT THEY DON'T STAY OUT FOR FORTY FIVE DAYS -- TYPICALLY IF THEY RE THEY ROTATE IN AND OUT. AND THAT'S PART OF OUR OUR HEALTH AND WELLNESS PROGRAM ADDRESSING THAT AND IT ENSURING THAT WE ARE TAKING CARE OF OF WHAT ARE. OUR DIFFERENT FIREFIGHTERS. THANK YOU SO MUCH CHIEF AND LOOK AT THE BOTTOM LINE IS -- WE ARE ALL GRATEFUL FOR THE THE PREVIOUS LEADERSHIP OF GOVERNOR BROWN -- YOUR PREDECESSOR AT YOU CAN LIVE IN VERY GRATEFUL -- NEESON YOURSELF HAVE HAVE ADVANCED THIS BUDGET -- IN THIS IS NOT AT ALL TRYING TO THROW STONES TO BE ABLE TO GET BACK TO WHERE WE WERE AND WHERE WE NEED TO BE -- AS WE CONFRONT WHAT IS IN FRONT OF US NOW. IN IT'S CLEAR THAT WE NEED ENHANCE RESOURCES APPOINTMENT. PERSONNEL AS WELL AS TECHNOLOGY TO BE A TO COMBAT THE REALITY THAT IS HERE IN. TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN SO -- WOULD LOVE IT WORKING OBVIOUSLY WITH THE BUDGET SUB CHAIR AND MADAM CHAIR HERE WITH BUDGET COMMITTEE. ON JUST GETTING A BETTER UNDERSTANDING. OF WHAT. IF THOSE NUMBERS THAT I HAD MENTIONED ARE STILL ACCURATE I DON'T NEED HIM NOWAND THEN THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE IS HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE. FOR AVERAGE ENGINE TO BE OUTFITTED. SO FROM START TO ACTUALLY ON THE STREET IS HOW LONG TWELVE MONTHS EIGHTEEN MONTHS. IT'S PROBABLY IT'S THE A A THIRD THERE'S ANOTHER IT'S COMPLICATED -- WITH OUR WITH OUR PROCUREMENT PROCESS SOMETIMES THAT DELAYS THINGS -- IT IN ORDER TO GET INTO A CONTRACT PERIOD WHERE WE CAN FOR SKATEBOARDER THE ENGINE SO ONCE THE ORDER AND ONCE THE ENGINES ORDERED -- WE CAN HAVE IT ON THE GROUND -- DEPENDING ON AND OUTFITTED -- THE THE OTHER PIECE OF THAT IS -- IF WE'RE ORDERING A LOT OF ENGINES A BIG NUMBER THEN IT GETS STAGGERED OUT INTO. BUT EACH ONE FROM ONE ENGINE START TO FINISH WE WOULD EASILY HAVE IT. ON THE GROUND -- OPERATIONAL WITHIN A YEAR THANK YOU. WE PUT ANY ITEMS IN TURN FINANCING ATTACHMENT. THANK YOU -- SO. I THINK WHAT'S IMPORTANT I GUESS TO RECOGNIZE IT I'VE KIND OF THREE POINTS ONE IS. ITS. THE FOCUS ON THE ENGINES IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. BUT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND IT'S ONE ELEMENT AS PART OF A CONFERENCE OF HOLISTIC PACKAGE OF PROPOSALS. SO IT'S ALSO FAIR TO SAY THAT -- WE DIDN'T HAVE -- A TWENTY FIRST CENTURY STATE OF THE ART HELICOPTERS -- THEY COULD FLY YOU AT NIGHT IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE BUT WERE PROPOSING TO CONTINUE THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE -- SEVENS. SEE ONE THIRTY FEDERAL OF AIR TANKERS TWENTY FIRST. NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE WE DIDN'T HAVE -- A FIRE DETECTION CAMERAS THAT ARE NOW CAN BE ABLE TO UTILIZE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY TECHNOLOGY -- IT TO BETTER ASSIST -- FIRE DETECTION IN NINETEEN TWENTY FIVE EITHER SO. ARE ARE THINKING IN THIS PACKAGE. IS. IS IT MORE LOOKING FORWARD -- TO S. T. PORTER MENTION IN THE STRATEGIC PLANNING PROCESS. TWENTY THIRTY YEARS FORWARD AND TO MAKE SURE THAT CAL FIRE IS EQUIPPED. THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY WITH -- WITH. A STATE OF THE ART UPDATED -- CAPABILITIES THAT INCLUDE ADDITIONAL ENGINES TO INCLUDE ADDITIONAL CREWS AS WELL AND SO WE THINK THAT GIVEN THE LIMITED RESOURCES. THAT THE PACKAGE THAT YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU IS THE MOST -- STRATEGIC. ASSET ALLOCATION SO TO SPEAK BETWEEN AVIATION RESOURCES BETWEEN TECHNOLOGY BETWEEN ENGINES -- TO PUT THE STATE IN A FORWARD -- IN THE MEANTIME. CAL FIRE WILL BE DOING THIS LONG TERM STRATEGIC PLAN LOOK HIM WILL BE COMING BACK IN AND TALKING ABOUT THOSE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. I'D ALSO SAY THAT. AS THE MET MADAM CHAIR MENTIONED IN THE BEGINNING. OF NEXT WEEK YOU'LL BE THERE IN THE COMING WEEK SHOULD BE TALK ABOUT BUDGET RESILIENCY -- PART OF IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO STAND IN THIS IS PART OF A LARGER PACKAGE OF THE BUDGET. AND AS PART OF THE LARGER -- BUDGET ARCHITECTURE OF THE BUDGET -- OF THE ADMINISTRATION IS SENSITIVE TO MAKING SURE THAT WERE -- FISCALLY PRUDENT IN TERMS OF ON GOING GENERAL FUND. AND SO -- WE BELIEVE THAT THIS PACKAGE NON GENERAL FUND BECAUSE IT HAS SUCH A GOOD RETURN ON INVESTMENT. IN TERMS OF OF DEALING WITH THESE RISKS BUT WE WANT TO BE SENSITIVE TO THE FACT THAT -- OF THE ONE OF A KIND OF CORE PRINCIPLES OF BUDGET RESILIENCY IS IS THAT WE DON'T KNOW -- HAVE ONGOING GENERAL FUND RESEARCH IS THAT WHEN THE WHEN THERE'S A SHORTFALL WE JUST TAKE IT ALL BACK. SO WHAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE IS THESE THIRTEEN ENGINES. CONTINUE TO BE FUNDED IN THE LONG TERM -- BECAUSE THERE'S TO STRATEGICALLY IMPORTANT -- AND I HAVE A BUDGET THAT IS ABLE TO MAKE THESE COMMITMENTS ON AN ONGOING BASIS SO WILL WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE THESE DISCUSSIONS BUT THAT'S KIND OF HOW WE WERE THINKING ABOUT IT IN TERMS OF PUTTING. THIS UP PACKAGE BEFORE YOU. AN INTERVIEW THIS RESPONDENT I'LL BE BRIEF LOOK -- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS AND I'VE ONLY BEEN HERE FOR YEARS START MY FIFTH. A YEAH BEEN SPECTACULAR TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH IN REGARDS TO THE FIRES THATWE'VE HAD. A KEY THE BUZZER -- IN THE PRIOR TO HER JERRY CROW FOOT -- WAS NOTHING SHORT OF AMAZING -- AND I HOPE YOU DON'T TAKE MY WORDS AS BEING CRITICAL BUT SINCE. TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN IN THE AREA THAT I REPRESENT NEARLY EIGHT THOUSAND HOMES HAVE BEEN LOST. AND I HAVE BEEN -- INITIALLY A BIT OBSESSED WITH MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE KEEPING OUR COMMUNITY SAY. SO WHAT I WILL SAY IS INVESTING SIXTY MILLION PER YEAR TO BE ABLE TO GET BACK TO MADE SEVENTY LEVELS WHEN IT COMES TO CAL FIRE FIRE ENGINES. IS A LOT LESS THAN HAVING IS BEING TWELVE BILLION PER YEAR UNINSURED LOSSES. THERE IS NO SILVER BULLET THAT'S GOING TO GET US OUT OF THIS REALITY THAT WERE IN IT'S GONNA TAKE ENHANCE FIRE PREVENTION WHICH IS WHY THIS LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR LAST YEAR ADVANCE TO BILLION DOLLARS. WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT IN THE SEVENTIES AND AT THE SAME TIME THOUGH LET'S TALK ABOUT THE BLACKHAWKS WE ALREADY IN UP TWELVE WE'RE GOING TO BE GETTING TO THIS YEAR. WE HAVE VIGT NAM THEIR HELICOPTERS THAT ARE STILL FLYING IN THE SKY. WE TALK ABOUT THE C. ONE THIRTIES WE'RE GONNA BE GETTING ONE MAYBE THREE YEAR -- FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OVER A SERIES OF YEARS SO. I DON'T NEED A STRATEGIC PLAN TO BE ABLE TO KNOW WE ARE LOWER THAN WE SHOULD BE WHEN IT COMES TO THE NUMBER OF ENGINES THAT NEED TO BE ON THE ROAD IN THIS STATE PROTECTING STRUCTURES IN FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES. IN SO -- WE HAVE BEEN WORKING REALLY WELL TOGETHER NOTHING CRITICAL ABOUT WHAT I HOPE MY WORDS HAVE COME OFF TODAY AND FROM TO FINANCE BECAUSE YOU HAVE ALL BEEN SPECTACULAR TO BE TO WORK WITH. GOVERNOR BROWN WAS SPECTACULAR GOVERNOR NEWSOME IS ALL OVER IT AND HE'S MAKING PHONE CALLS AND TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE GETTING WHAT WE NEED AND WHAT I'LL SAY IS. IT'S NOT ENOUGH. IN ALL DESCENDED THEIR AND KNOW THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE A GREATER CONVERSATION. SHAKE THAT SILVER MINING. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR SOME. I THINK THE OTHER AGENCIES I ALSO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND SPECIFICALLY THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. FOR THE CONTINUED PRIORITIZATION OF FINDING THAT RIGHT BALANCE WITHIN OUR BUDGET. CONSTRAINTS. I HAVE A THE SPECIFIC QUESTION RELATED TO NINE ONE ONE EMERGENCY SERVICES. WITH FIRE EVENTS WE HEAR A LOT ABOUT TRYING TO IMPROVE THE REVERSE NINE ONE ONE ALERTING RESIDENTS OF A PENDING. DISASTER OR THREAT TO THEM. BUT WE ALSO RELY ON NINE ONE ONE TO REPORT THE FIRST DICE TO SEE. A POTENTIAL FIRE IN WITH THE CAL FIRE STRATEGY OF MASSIVE EARLY RESPONSE. GETTING THE EARLY NOTICES CRITICAL. TO WE LEARNED THROUGH A TRAGEDY A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO IN THE BIG SUR COAST. IN EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATE WHO DIED IN A BLOW A HOLE IN THE ROCK SEGERA PADA BEACH [inaudible] HIS FRIENDS. DIALED. NINE ONE ONE BUT WERE NOT HONEST SERVICE OF ANOTHER PROVIDER THAT HAD CELL SERVICE IN THAT AREA. SO ALL JUST USE NAMES THEY WERE ON VERIZON. THAT DIDN'T CONNECT THEM. TO NINE ONE ONE THERE WAS AN EIGHTEEN T. SERVICE PROVIDER THAT IF THEY'D HAD EIGHTEEN T. SERVICE. THEY COULD HAVE CONNECTED EMERGENCY RESPONDERS GOT THERE. THE YOUNG MAN'S LIFE WAS LOST I DON'T KNOW FOR EARLIER RESPONSE WOULD HAVE CHANGED THE OUTCOME BUT IT BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTION. A GAP THINK IN IT SEEMS LIKE ANYONE WHO DIALS. PROVIDER. IF THERE'S A CELL TOWER THAT RECEIVES THAT MESSAGE. HEAVY ARE YOU AWARE OF THIS SITUATION OF IT. A NON CONNECTING COULD THERE BE. A RESPONSE OF THE PROVIDERS THE PRIVATE SECTOR. THE WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAVE A PLAN WITH THEM IF YOU DIAL 911- IN THE HEAR YOUR SIGNAL THEY CAN RELAY AT TO A NINE ONE ONE OPERATOR. SURROUNDING A I DON'T KNOW OF THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE ENOUGH TO LOOK INTO IT -- BUT I WILL TELL YOU THAT YOU KNOW TYPICALLY WHEN WHEN IF. IT'S A GNOSTIC THERE IS A CAPABILITY IF YOU'RE ON ONE CARRIER THAT'LL IT'LL BE CLOSE TO A SITE AND THEN IT GOES AND I ONCE SYSTEM. THAT SAID THERE'S PARTS OF THE STATE THAT ARE THAT ARE VERY VERY -- SKETCHY I GUESS YOU COULD SAY WITH WEEK ABILITY TO TO MOVE THE SIGNAL AT ITS INFRASTRUCTURE THE COASTLINE BEING ONE OF THEM -- FURTHER NORTH YOU GO IT BECOMES MORE SKETCHY -- GETS INTO MY MY POINT EARLIER ABOUT RESILIENCY BUT I ALSO WILL TELL YOU THAT THE UPGRADE OF THE NINE ONE SYSTEM WHICH WAS. FUNDED AND AND BUILT IN THE SEVENTIES MCKAY -- THE NEXT GEN NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM THAT WE ARE WORKING ON AND CONTINUE TO WORK ON IT NEED TO BE BUILT OUT. ADDRESSES MORE OF THAT HELPS TO BUILD AN AND FILL THOSE GAPS THAT. THAT EXIST -- BY USING DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES -- TO BE ABLE TO SENSE OF TEXT TO THE NINE ONE ONE WHEN YOU CAN'T GET A SIGNAL WHAT YOU CAN GET A TAX THEY WORK ON DIFFERENT PLATFORMS -- THE ABILITY -- TO TO A BETTER POSITION OR IDENTIFY THE LOCATION OF THE CALLER. AND BE ABLE TO GET RESOURCES THERE FASTER RELIABILITY IN THE CALLING -- AND HOW THEY DO THAT ALL OF THESE THINGS AND MANY MORE COME WITH -- GOING FROM AN ANALOG -- BACKACHE SYSTEM TO SEE STATE OF THE ART AND AND MOVING THIS FOR SO IT'S VERY CRITICAL THAT WE WE MOVE FOR WITH THAT NINE ONE PLEASE I REALIZE THERE. OF OF OUR SEVENTY MILES OF BIG SUR COASTLINE THERE'S ONLY ABOUT FIVE MILES THAT HAVE CELL CONNECTIVITY THROUGHOUT THAT STRETCH. THERE ARE SOME NINE ONE ONE CALL BOXES IN THOSE SO I THINK WE NEED. TO KEEP ACTIVE EVEN THOUGH THEY SEEM MAYBE ANTIQUATED BUT IF YOU DON'T HAVE A CELL PHONE CONNECTION. A CALL BOX IS THE NEXT BEST THING. BUT IF YOU COULD EXPLORE THAT QUESTION OF ONLY BEING ABLE TO CONNECT WITH NINE ONE ONE WITH YOUR SERVICE PROVIDER WHEN THERE COULD BE ANOTHER CELL TOWER THAT COULD HEAR THAT. MESSAGE -- I'D APPRECIATE WILL I WILL BE BACK WITH YOU IN THAT SPECIFIC I APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. VERY MUCH -- SENATOR MONTAIGNE'S [inaudible] AND SHE ORDER -- THE EDGES WERE TECHNOLOGY I APPRECIATE ALL THE QUESTIONS YOU ANSWERED AND MY THE NUMBER OF MY COLLEAGUES FROM THE FULL BUDGET COMMITTEE THAT SERVE ON SUB TO IN IN YOUR COMMENT THAT YOU WOULD BE.

ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATED LET'S MOVE NOW INTO OUR THIRD AND FINAL. PANEL FOR TODAY THE THIRD PANEL IS DISASTER READINESS PROPOSALS MANAGER IS A POSSIBLE GIVING A QUICK BY BREAK. ABSOLUTELY THAT'S A BIT LIKE THREE OURSELVES YOU KNOW I'M IT IS. AND YOU KNOW I'M WITH YOU ON THAT MUSICAL RIGHT HERE. A RIGHTS. I SHOULD OF ALPHA. WHY DON'T WE TAKE A? FEW MINUTE POSSUM WHEN I SEE THE PARTIES ARE BACK IN WILL. RECONVENE WILL FIRST HEAR FROM. JOSH GO VERY SINCE THE PROGRAM BUDGET MANAGER DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. WILL AGAIN HEAR FROM -- HELEN KIRSTEN WITH THE LA JOH. AND AGAIN THE SECURITY CHIEF FROM THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES IS AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS THANK YOU FORGET IT GETS STARTED. THANK YOU JOSH TARGET APARTMENT FINANCE SO -- IDEN GOING TO SPEAK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SOME OF THE OTHER -- EMERGENCY RESPONSE AND PREPAREDNESS PROPOSALS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THE BUDGET -- PERHAPS THE CURSE OF BEING ON THE FINAL PANEL IS A MY COMMENTS WERE MAINLY GOING TO CIRCLE AROUND NINE ONE ONE WHICH IS CLEARLY BEEN A TOPIC OF CONVERSATION MULTIPLE TIMES SO. I'LL TRY TO BE BRIEF AS I GO THROUGH THAT -- THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES RESOURCES FOR THE CONTINUED ROLLOUT OF THE NEXT GENERATION NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM CONSISTENT WITH PROPOSALS THAT WERE APPROVED BY THE LEGISLATURE IN THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET -- CALIFORNIA'S EXISTING NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM IS OUTDATED USES OLD TECHNOLOGY AND IS PRONE TO OUTAGES DURING MAJOR DISASTERS. AND PROPS TO SENATOR NIELSEN'S CONCERNS AND TRYING TO PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT PICTURE ABOUT WHAT THE UPGRADE TO THE NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM ACTUALLY INCLUDES A MAJOR COMPONENT OF THE NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM IS THE MICROWAVE NETWORK WHICH IS ALSO. RECEIVED -- SOME ATTENTION HERE TODAY A CALIFORNIA HAS AN ANTIQUATED ANALOG MICROWAVE NETWORK THAT MUST BE UPGRADED TO A DIGITAL NETWORKS SO THAT ALTERNATE CONNECTION IS AVAILABLE TO RE ROUTE CALLS TO OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE. WHEN THE DISPATCH CENTER IS DAMAGED EVACUATED OR OVERWHELMED CURRENTLY A DISPATCH CENTER IS -- GENERALLY LEADING TO BE A SINGLE CONNECTION THAT TYPICALLY NOT HARDENED AND CANNOT SURVIVE A DISASTER WHEN THE DISASTER OCCURS THE INFRASTRUCTURE CAN BE DAMAGE TO THE POINT WHERE CALLS CANNOT BE ANSWERED AND OR RE ROUTED. AT OR SENT TO A ANOTHER DISPATCH CENTER DISPATCH CENTERS -- TYPICALLY HAVE A SINGLE BACKUP DISPATCH CENTER IN A NEIGHBORING CITY OR COUNTY. DURING AN EVACUATION OR HEAVY CALL VOLUME THOUGH HOWEVER CALLS TO ONLY THE SINGLE ALTERNATE DISPATCH CENTER WHEN BOTH DISPATCH CENTERS NEED TO BE EVACUATED. NINE ONE ONE CALLS AGAIN CAN BE -- CANNOT BE RE ROUTED -- UNLESS ALTERNATE CIRCUITS ARE MANUALLY RE ROUTED WHICH IS A PROCESS THAT CAN TAKE TWELVE TO TWENTY FOUR HOURS. WITH NEXT GENERATION NINE ONE ONE AND THE NEW DIGITAL MICROWAVE NETWORK CALLS TO ANY DISPATCH CENTER CAN BE RE ROUTED TO ANY OTHER LOCATION IN THE STATE PROVIDING A HARDENED. REDUNDANT SYSTEM THAT IS RESPONSIVE TO THE SCOPE OF DISASTERS CALIFORNIA HAS FACED IN RECENT HISTORY -- ADDITIONALLY ALL JUST HIGHLIGHT. TWO OR THREE OTHER FEATURES OF THE NEXT GENERATION NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM THAT IF I BELIEVE ALL ALSO BEEN MENTIONED ALREADY HAD THROUGHOUT TODAY'S DISCUSSION -- IT WILL DELIVER INCREASED LOCATION ACCURACY FOR WIRELESS CALLS WILL PROVIDE STATEWIDE COMMON DELIVERY SYSTEM FOR ALERTS AND WARNINGS IT WILL ALLOW AGENCIES TO UTILIZE STATE OF THE ART MAPPING IN ORDER TO BETTER LOCATE CALLERS -- AND IT WILL ALSO INTEGRATE WITH THE FIRST RESPONDER NETWORK AUTHORITIES NATIONWIDE WIRELESS BROADBAND NETWORK INITIATIVE KNOWN AS FIRST MET THE CALIFORNIA OPTED IN TO LAST YEAR -- THE SECONDARY COMPONENT COMPONENT OF THE UPGRADED NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM IS THE PIECE THAT WAS ALSO INCLUDED IN LAST YEAR'S PROPOSAL -- WHICH IS THE MODERNIZATION OF THE AND RESTRUCTURING OF THE FEE THAT SUPPORTS THE NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM WHICH IS THE THAT HAS STATE EMERGENCY TELEPHONE NUMBER ACCOUNT FEE ALSO KNOWN AS SATNA. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PER DAY -- PROPOSES TO RESTRUCTURE THAT FEE EFFECTIVE JANUARY. ONE TWO THOUSAND TWENTY THE EXISTING FEE HAS BEEN FUNDING THE NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE HOWEVER THE REVENUE HAS DECLINED PRECIPITOUSLY OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. AS IT IS BASED ON AN OUTDATED MODE OF COMMUNICATION INTEREST STATE VOICE CALLS. OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS ANNUAL REVENUE HAS DECREASED FROM OVER ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO JUST SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS LAST YEAR WHICH WAS TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS THE LOWER THAN JUST THE YEAR BEFORE AT EIGHTY THE EXISTING STRUCTURE FEE STRUCTURE IS INADEQUATE TO EVEN SUSTAIN THE LEGACY NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM. ABSENT THE BUILD OUT OF THE NEXT GENERATION NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM THAT CALIFORNIA DESPERATELY NEEDS. THE REVISED FEE STRUCTURE WILL INCLUDE A FLAT RATE MONTHLY CHARGE ON ALL ACCESS LINES THE RATE WILL BE DETERMINED ANNUALLY CONSISTENT WITH LEGISLATIVELY APPROVED SPENDING PLANS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THE BUDGET. AND JUST BRIEFLY -- THERE ARE MULTIPLE OTHER PROPOSALS AND IN THIS BUDGET RELATED TO EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE TO JUST ENTION A FEW -- THERE'S A FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR IN THE CURRENT YEAR 200-018-1915 MILLION FOR A PUBLIC OUTREACH CAMPAIGN THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS OF THAT AND GOING TO THE CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEERS TO THE OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH. FOR STATEWIDE PUBLIC EDUCATION MILLION DOLLARS TO THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES PRIMARILY -- FOR GRANTS TO COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS -- THERE'S FUNDING FOR AN UPGRADED INTEROPERABLE RADY. INTEROPERABLE RADIO NETWORK -- OVER A FIVE YEAR PERIOD TO THE RADIO NETWORK WILL BE UPGRADED -- SO THAT RADIO SYSTEMS ARE INTEROPERABLE AND CAN COMMUNICATE ACROSS SYSTEMS AND THE ADVENT OF DISASTERS. TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS HAS ALSO BEEN INCLUDED FOR AN ONGOING PRE POSITIONING PROGRAM WHICH IS ALSO RECEIVED A EXTENSIVE DISCUSSION HERE TODAY. AND ALL THE OTHER IS THE RE AUTHORIZATION OF THE DISASTER RESPONSE EMERGENCY OPERATIONS ACCOUNT THAT WE'VE PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED AS WELL -- THAT'S ABOUT IT FOR MY OPENING COMMENTS HAPPENING ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS [inaudible] THERE. THANKS SO MUCH US IF YOU TURN TO PAGE NINE WE SUMMARIZED OF THE pTHAT ARE IN THE BUDGET -- FINANCE COVERED AT THE VAST MAJORITY OF THEM JUST A COUPLE OTHER ONES I WANT TO HIT ON VERY VERY QUICKLY -- THERE'S AN INCREASE IN FEDERAL TRUST MANDATORY OF SIXTY MILLION THAT'S RELATED TO THE HAZARD MITIGATION GRANT PROGRAM I MENTIONED THAT PREVIOUSLY -- THE STATE IS SLATED TO TO RECEIVE. UPWARDS OF A BILLION DOLLARS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FEES HAZARD MITIGATION -- GRANT SAID THAT CAN GO TO STATE AGENCIES AS WELL AS LOCAL SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT -- QUITE A BIT OF FINDING ON THIS WOULD PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDS A THORNY -- FOR YES WOULD MINISTRIES GRANTS BUT IT'S IT'S REALLY LEGISLATURE MAY WANNA KEEP IN MIND -- THERE'S ALSO DOCUMENTATION OF TWENTY MILLION FOR CDA ANOTHER SIXTEEN MILLION THAT SCHEDULE FOR THE EARTHQUAKE EARLY WARNING SYSTEM AND THAT SOMETHING ELSE THAT'S BEEN AN ONGOING THING THE STATE IS INVESTED IN ITS -- EARTHQUAKE REALLY WAITING SYSTEM IN THIS WOULD COME OUT FINISHED BASICALLY THE BUILD OUT BUT NOT DEAL WITH THE ON GOING -- FUNDING FOR THAT PROGRAM. SO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE TEN ALL QUICKLY GO OVER JUST A COUPLE OF VERY HIGH LEVEL PRELIMINARY COMMENTS WE HAVE WE'RE STILL ANALYZING ALL OF THESE PROPOSALS. BUT BUT THESE ARE JUST A FEW THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND -- SO ONE COMMENT IS JUST THAT SOMEBODY'S PROPOSAL'S LACK DETAIL AT THIS POINT -- I CERTAINLY THE ADMINISTRATION'S ANYONE COMING AND BUT BUT KNOW THAT THERE ARE FEW PROPOSALS THAT DON'T -- DON'T HAVE A LOT OF DOCUMENTATION BEHIND THEM YET ON THE PUBLIC EDUCATION ONE IS IS ONE I KNOW YOU'LL BE CONSIDERING THAT SOON -- THE NINE ONE ONE PROPOSAL AN EARTHQUAKE EARLY WARNING THERE'S DOES YOUR SORT OF CONTINUATION FROM LAST YEAR BUT THERE'S NOT A LOT OF INFORMATION ON THIS YEAR'S PIECE -- SO THOSE ARE SOME EXAMPLES THE LEGISLATURE JUST WANNA MAKE SURE IT'S COMFORTABLE WITH THE INFORMATION THAT THE INFORMATION THAT THEY RECEIVE -- IS SUFFICIENT -- TO MAKE TO HELP TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS ABOUT HOW TO FIND THESE PROGRAMS WHETHER MORE OR LESS THAN -- THAN THE ADMINISTRATION OR THE SAME ABOUT THE MYSTERY IT'S ABOUT FUNDS SOURCE -- SOME OF THESE PROPOSALS REALLY RAISE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT FUND SOURCE THE MINISTRATION MAKES VARIOUS CHOICES ABOUT HOW TO FIND. ON SOME OF THESE PROPOSALS FOR EXAMPLE THE NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT -- YOU KNOW THERE'S CURRENTLY A FEW STRUCTURE THAT'S IN PLACE AND YOU DECISIONS ABOUT. DO YOU WE WANT TO CHANGE THAT HOW DO YOU WANT TO CHANGE THAT STRUCTURE ON TO SUPPORT BOTH THE BUILD OUT OF NEXT GEN AS WELL AS JUST THE CONTINUATION OF SUPPORTING OUR NINE ONE SYSTEM -- HOW MUCH RELY ON THE GENERAL FUND IS A LOAN OR -- ACTUALLY JUST AS A CONTRIBUTION VERSES THOSE THOSE -- FOR OTHER SPECIAL FUNDS -- SIMILAR ISSUES REGARDING EARTHQUAKE EARLY WARNING -- WE'VE FUNDED SOME GENERAL WE'VE SPENT GENERAL FUND TO BUILD OUT THE SYSTEM -- LAST YEAR THERE IS A REPORT THAT RAISE SOME OPTIONS OF POTENTIAL CHARGES THAT COULD BE IN PLACE TO FUNDS THAT SYSTEM IN ON A ONGOING BASIS BUT NO DECISIONS HAVE BEEN MADE. SO THAT SOMETHING THE LEGISLATURE'S -- LIKELY TO HAVE TO CHECK TO TO TACKLE -- IN THE COMING YEAR HOW WE THINK ABOUT WHAT'S THE BEST SOURCE OF FUNDING -- SO THAT WE HAVE A GOOD EARTHQUAKE EARLY WARNING -- TO AND THEN A FINAL -- CONSIDERATION IS THAT -- YOU SOME OF THESE PROPOSALS REYES CHOICES ABOUT THE TIMING OF FUNDING ON NOTABLY AT AS THE COMMITTEE WILL CONSIDER VERY SOON THERE SOME THESE PROPOSALS THAT ARE FUNDED -- FOR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND CERTAINLY THERE'S AN URGENCY TO SOME OF THESE PROPOSALS -- BUT YOU'LL HAVE TO TRADE OFF THAT URGENCY VERSES ON JUST THAT THOSE PROPOSALS WILL GO THROUGH THE TYPICAL BUDGET PROCESS THANK YOU. QUESTIONS ON FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THIRTY NIELSEN FOLLOWED BY CENTER MORE LOT. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR GIVING SOME SPECIFICITY TO THE NINE ONE ONE HAD THAT INFORMATION BEENAVAILABLE TO ME YOU'VE. LAST YEAR THEN MAYBE THINGS COULD BE A LITTLE DIFFERENT -- BUT THIS IS HELPFUL TO KNOW THAT WHAT IS A PLAN THERE IS A PLAN. A WHAT WE WILL ALSO NEED TO DO IS THOUGH ESTABLISHING SOME WHAT I WOULD CALL BENCH MARKS. IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM. I DON'T WANNA WAIT WAITING A FULL YEAR. TO SEE HOW THINGS WENT WE NEED TO BE ASSESSING AS WE GO ALONG IT'S GOING TO BE QUITE A COMMITMENT OF THE RESOURCE IS NOT AS MUCH AS SOME OF THESE TECH PROJECTS THAT WE'VE BEEN EMBARKING ON OVER THE YEARS BUT BUT WE WANT TO KEEP TRACK OF IT. BUT I WANTED TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE ASSESSMENT AND NOW I'VE I FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE THAN I DID BEFORE BECAUSE THERE'S SOME SPECIFICITY TO IT. SO THE MORE LAW. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR ON THE INOPERABLE INTEROPERABLE SPEAKING -- PUBLIC SAFETY RADIO SYSTEM -- THE COUNTY OF ORANGE THAT EIGHT HUNDRED MEGAHERTZ SYSTEM. AND WE GOT EVERYTHING EVERYBODY COORDINATED INSIDE OUR EIGHT HUNDRED SQUARE MILES AND BILL TO THE TOWER ON CATALINA ISLAND SO WE HAD EVERYTHING TAKEN CARE OF BUT WE GET THAT TWENTY YEARS AGO SO I'M JUST KIND OF CURIOUS. WHY ARE WE WHY IS AHEAD IN THIS IN PLACE ALREADY WHY WE'RE WE'RE PUTTING? TEN SIXTY MILLION OVER FIVE YEARS BUT IT. IT SEEMS LIKE WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE SOONER SOME MAYBE OR SOME HISTORY THAT I'M NOT A FAMILIAR WITH. SO A FIRM MAYBE SOME OF THE TECHNICAL DETAILS -- WOULD DEFER TO ADD DIRECTOR GULAR DUTY BUT I THINK IT IS THAT FAIR TO SAY THAT ALSO -- THERE SEVERAL DEPARTMENTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT RELY ON PUBLIC SAFETY RADIOS AND THERE HAS BEEN -- INDIVIDUALIZED EFFORTS TO UPGRADE RADIO SYSTEMS -- DEPARTMENT CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION FOR HAS RECENTLY BEEN UPGRADING THEIR RADIO SYSTEM AND PARTS OF THOSE UPGRADES INCLUDE PIECES OF INTER OPERABILITY BUT I THINK THIS -- STATEWIDE APPROACH HERE MANAGED BY -- YES IS REALLY FOCUSED ON PROVIDING THE BACKBONE AND ABILITY FOR ALL THESE RADIO NETWORKS -- THAT ARE THE MOST UP TO DATE I THINK P. TWENTY FIVE CYNG COMPLIANT RADIO SYSTEMS TO BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE COMMUNICATE -- AT WHICH IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT IN A DISASTER EVENTS AND EMERGENCY EVENTS WHERE YOU HAVE MULTIPLE -- AGENCIES MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS RESPONDING ALL TO THE SAME INCIDENT TRYING TO COMMUNICATE. HOW WILL THIS BE A MATCHING PROGRAM WHERE ORANGE COUNTY IS ALREADY YET MAYBE ESTABLISH WHAT WOULD HAVE TO UPGRADE -- I BELIEVE THAT THIS WOULD PROVIDE KIND OF THE BACKBONE AND ABILITY FOR LOCAL ENTITIES TO COMMUNICATE ON THE INTEROPERABLE NETWORK BUT I BELIEVE IT IS A FEE FOR SERVICE TYPE APPROACH BUT THE BY -- DIRECTOR GILLARD WHICH IF WE HAVE THAT INFORMATION. THANK YOU. SIR I DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION RIGHT NOW I HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT TO FIND OUT EXACTLY. HOW THAT'S GONNA LINCOLN BUT THE IDEA BEHIND THE UPGRADE OF THE SYSTEM? WE HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WITH THE SPIRIT SYSTEMS AS WELL THIS ALSO WILL ALLOW BETTER INNER ABA BILLION PLUGIN ON THOSE ON THOSE SYSTEMS SO -- BUT I I CAN GET BACK TO YOU ON WASTE MORE SPECIFICS ON THAT GREAT THE ORANGE COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPT DEPARTMENT HAS A WEBSITE OF OF WHAT THEY'VE DONE IT'S STILL TO OUT SO IT MIGHT BE. HELPFUL ON THE SIXTY MILLION FROM THE GENERAL FUND. GOING TO THE NEXT GEN -- NINE ONE ONE WITH TEN MILLION THIS YEAR -- I LIKE YOUR TERM OF RESTRUCTURING THE FEE MATCHES AND INTERESTING TAKE ON IT WHICH IS SORT OF IN MY THOUGHT ALL ALONG THAT I I TRY TO WORK WITH REGINALD SALVADOR LAST YEAR AND I BUILT A PRETTY GOOD FILE OF TRYING TO COMMUNICATE. WITH DUE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH THE NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM AND SO I APPRECIATE. WHAT ELLIE -- SAYS SOME SOME REQUEST BLACK DETAIL AND I'M STILL GETTING A LACK OF A DETAIL THAT TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. WHAT'S THE CAPITAL INFRASTRUCTURE WHAT WILL IT COST OUR WE IMPLEMENTING COMPARED TO CURRENT TECHNOLOGIES WE'VE GOT. THE COMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY FOR WORKING ON FIVE G. HOW WE ARE WAS AT ALL FITTING IN WHAT'S THE OVERALL GAME PLAN AND AND AND THEN. YOU KNOW THAT THERE ARE SYSTEMIC CHANGES. PEOPLE TO WEAR WATCHES ANYMORE BECAUSE THEY'RE LOOKING AT THEIR CELL PHONES. RIGHT MOVIES THE KIDS ARE MORE WATCHES IN LEARNING. SO SO YOU KNEW THAT LAND LINES WERE DECREASING FOR A LONG TIME AND THAT SELLS. CELLPHONES EXPANDING AND AND SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN YOU KNOW SEEMS LIKE IT'S LANGUAGE WORK CAN BE DONE. YEARS AGO AND I AGAIN IS JUST ONE OF THOSE MAYBE THERE'S A HISTORY TO IT. MAYBE YOU COULD FILL ME IN ON THAT. IT'S CERTAINLY BEEN AN OUTDATED LONG OVERDUE -- RESTRUCTURING OF THE FEE IT'S BASED ON INTRASTATE VOICE CALLS WHICH AS YOU WOULD IMAGINE AND ALLUDED -- TO IS A DYING -- MODE OF COMMUNICATION AND AS PEOPLE MAKE LESS CALLS -- THERE'S LESS REVENUE AND THAT'S KIND OF JUST THE MOST I GUESS SIMPLISTIC OVERVIEW OF WHY THE REVENUE HAS STEADILY DECLINED ITS DECLINE THOUGH TO A POINT WHERE IT CAN'T SUSTAIN LEGACY NINE ONE ONE EXPENDITURES AND EVEN IF WE WEREN'T. PROPOSING TO FURTHER -- BUILD OUT A NEXT GENERATION NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM AN UPGRADE THOSE SERVICES -- THERE WOULD BE PROBLEMS AND WE WOULD YOU KNOW BE FACING A A SIMILAR PROPOSAL TO RESTRUCTURE THE FEE IN A WAY THAT MATCHES -- CURRENT MODES OF COMMUNICATION WOULD YOU GET THERE LET ME HELP YOU GIVE ME SPREADSHEETS AND PROJECTIONS AND FORECASTS OF WHERE YOU'RE GOING SO. MAYBE IN THE DAY IT IS IN THE TAX INCREASE WHICH IS BECAUSE IT'S REQUIRING A TWO THIRDS VOTE. IT INFERS THAT IT'S MORE OF A TAX AND FEES I'D LIKE. TO TO WE CAN DO TO MAKE IT LEAR AND UNDERSTANDABLE TO OUR CONSTITUENTS -- WE BELIEVE IT REQUIRES A TWO THIRDS VOTE I THINK THAT THERE ARE -- CERTAINLY DIRECT BENEFITS TO EVERY -- OF THE AT ALL OF THE SURCHARGE PAYERS CLEARLY RECEIVE A DIRECT BENEFIT FROM THEIR PAYMENT INTO THE SYSTEM HOWEVER THERE ARE NUANCES WITH -- VISITORS FROM OUT OF STATE WHO FOR EXAMPLE WOULD BENEFIT FROM THE SYSTEM BUT NOT NECESSARILY PAIN INTO CALIFORNIANS NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM SO WE BELIEVE THAT IT. IS A TWO THIRDS VOTE IS PRUDENT ON IT -- THE LEVEL OF DETAIL THAT A SUFFICES TO GIVE YOU COMFORT IT'S A BIT COMPLICATED BUT ALSO ON A KIND OF SURFACE LEVEL AND LOOKING AT AROUND A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS IN TOTAL EXPENDITURES FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. AS YOU MAINTAIN THE LEGACY NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM AND UPGRADE TO THE NEXT GENERATION NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM AND THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT WAS INTRODUCED LAST YEAR A PROVIDED A PROCESS WHEREBY THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES WOULD COLLECT. INFORMATION ABOUT THE TOTAL NUMBER OF ACCESS LINES AND SUBSCRIBERS EACH YEAR AND WOULD THEN COMPARE THAT TO THE TOTAL COST OF THE PROGRAM FOR THAT YEAR WHICH ARE APPROVED THROUGH THE BUDGET. AND THEN YOU KNOW IS TO BASICALLY THAT SIMPLE MATH THAT SETS THE FEE FOR THAT CALENDAR YEAR AND WE'VE. TRIED TO UTILIZE THE TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN THE CURRENT YEAR THAT IS PROPOSED IN THE FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET YEAR THAT'S PROPOSED TO ALSO -- TRY TO MITIGATE SOME OF THESE LIMITED TERM BUILD OUT COSTS. DIDN'T MITIGATE THE IMPACT THAT THEY WOULD HAVE ON KIND OF A YOU KNOW QUITE A LOT QUOTE ON QUOTE SPIKE IN THE FEE THAT'S CHARGED AND TRIED -- TO COMES MOVE THAT OUT SO THAT YOU'RE NOT SEEN A LARGE FLUCTUATION -- OF THE MONTHLY FEE -- YOU -- YEAR OVER YEAR SO RELATIVELY FLAT DURING THE BUILD OUT. IT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE CELL PHONE COMPANIES ARE ALREADY PAYING A FEE FOR PUBLIC SAFETY IS THAT IS THAT NOT CORRECT. AS PART OF THEIR ABILITY TO TO OPERATE IN THE STATE THEY WERE. ALREADY PAYING A FEE TO THE STATE CAL OR ACTUALLY PAYING THEM FOR THE SERVICE THAT THEY PROVIDE AS BACK WHICH IS WHICH IS I MEAN. YOU KNOW THE FEE IS COLLECTED BY -- THE USERS -- WHICH ARE THE PEOPLE WHO USE THAT. WE USE CELLPHONES OR HAVE A PHONE BUT BUT THE IT WE CONTRACT WITH THE YOU EASIER TELECOM UTILITIES TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE AS OF SERVICES SO -- THERE'S AND AND THAT'S ALSO PART OF THE RESTRUCTURING AS WELL AS BEING ABLE TO GET EFFICIENCIES. IN THE IN THE OLDER SYSTEM -- IT VERSUS THE NEWER SYSTEM IN BEING ABLE TO HAVE THEM BE MORE BECAUSE YOU KNOW AS YOU INCREASE YOUR TECHNOLOGY CAPABILITY YOU'RE GONNA BUILD IN SOME EFFICIENCIES TELL. KATE MARA LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR ANALYSIS I LOVE DETAIL THANKS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- I WOULD LIKE TO THINK ANY FINAL COMMENTS YOU'D LIKE TO MAKE BEFORE OPEN UP TO PUBLIC COMMENT. THANK ALL OF YOU FOR THE TIME TODAY AND ON THESE REALLY. COMPLICATED TOPICS BUT WE APPRECIATE YOU ALL AND THEN PUSH IT WORKING WITH YOU IN THE COMING YEAR AND THE FEELING IS MUTUAL NEWS OR IMPORTANT ISSUES ON THE WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO DRILL DOWN ON LIKE TO OPEN UP FOR PUBLIC COMMENT [inaudible] AND ONE PERSON. GOOD AFTERNOON CALL MAY SO THE SENATE FOREST TRUST AND I'LL BE BRIEF GIVEN THE HOUR. EYES ONE TO GO BACK TO SOMETHING BOTH SENATOR WHITE HOUSE SKI IN SENATOR SKINNER HAD BEEN RAISING ON SORT OF THAT BALANCE BETWEEN WHERE SHOULD WE WE WE WORKING. AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT THIS IS SORT OF TO HAVE OUR URBAN -- ARE WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE CHALLENGES AND YOU HAVE OUR WILDLAND AREAS WHERE WE HAVE THESE FORESTS HEALTH CONDITIONS IN A WATERSHED HEALTH CONDITIONS THAT ARE REALLY. DEGRADED TO THE PAST MANAGEMENT LONG TERM FIRE SUPPRESSION THE REALLY TO ALMOST AND FUELS REDUCTION AND ACTIVITIES LIKE THAT DIRECTLY ROUND. COMMUNITIES BUT A LOT OF THAT AND REDUCING THE RISK THERE IS GOING TO COME DOWN TO HARDENING HOMES WORKING WITH HOMEOWNERS TO HELP REDUCE THE RISK. SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE SORT OF YOU KNOW STRUCTURE THE STRUCTURE CONFLAGRATIONS THAT WE'VE SEEN AND SANTA ROSA AND IN PARADISE IN THE WIL THE FIRE. MRS THAT'S ONE ENORMOUS CHALLENGE OVER TO HAVE TO HAVE SORT OF AN ONGOING. EFFORT BOTH ON THE STATE LEVEL AND FROM LOCALS AND DIFFERENT CENTER PROGRAMS THE OTHER IS OF COURSE. HOW DO WE TRY AND RESTORE MORE RESILIENCE TO ARE FORESTED AREAS THAT HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY PAST MANAGEMENT AND HISTORIC MINING AND? YOU KNOW IRE SUPPRESSION BEING A VERY SIGNIFICANT PART OF THAT AND THAT'S ALSO A HUGE CHALLENGE AND ONE THAT I DON'T THINK WE CAN IGNORE THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO MAKE -- SUSTAINED INVESTMENTS IN TRYING TO RESTORE RESILIENCE THEY'RE BOTH MECHANICALLY ENTER PRESCRIBED FIRE SO WE CAN GET BACK TO A CONDITION WHERE FIRE ON THE LANDSCAPE IS NOT INHERENTLY CATASTROPHIC BECAUSE THERE IS NO SORRY OR WE DON'T HAVE FIRE. IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF WHEN THANKS THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. A GOOD. AFTERNOON WITHOUT JEFF MASTON REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA FIRE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION. FOR FRAUD LIKE TO SAY THAT WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO CONTINUING OUR DISCUSSIONS WITH BOTH CALLOW YES AND CAL FIRE ON THE PHONE WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE PROBLEMS. WE WOULD LIKE TO THANK VERY MUCH THE GOVERNOR AND THE COMMITTEES FOR THE OUR PRE POSITIONING MONIES THAT WERE GRANTED LAST YEAR WE THINK THAT'S A GOOD WAY TO START. AND KICKSTART ARE -- REFINED. FROM A PERSPECTIVE OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT. DURING THE CAMP HILL WILL CEASE FIRE LOCAL GOVERNMENT PROVIDED THERE -- THAT'S THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF OF RESEARCH IS YOUR HEAD AT THOSE INCIDENTS BUT I I NEED TO REMIND YOU THAT WOULD LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAS NOT RECOVERED FROM THE RECESSION. HARTFORD FARMERS ARE SMALLER TODAY THAN THEY WERE IN THE SEVENTIES AS WELL AND A LOT OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH -- UNFUNDED MANDATES BY THE STATE AND ALSO SOME OF THIS TAX SHIPS THAT HAVE OCCURRED BY THE STATE SO THAT IS AN IMPACT RECKLESS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT AS A WHOLE. LESLIE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT ENHANCING. THE OF SURVIVABILITY OF HOMES IN INTERFACE WE GENERALLY DO THAT AS DO ALL LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BY ADOPTING THE CALIFORNIA FIRE CODE. CALIFORNIA FIRE CODE REALLY LIVES WITHIN CAL FIRE AND TO THE OFFICE OF THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL'S OFFICE TO YOU HAVE A MECHANISM RIGHT NOW.

WE COMMEND THE STATE'S COMMITMENT TO EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS AND ARE GAD TO SEE A GROWING FOCUS ON SAVING HOMES AND HUMAN LIVES. THE HUMAN DEVASTATION OF RECENT FIRES SEASONS HAS SHOWN THE NEED TO INVEST IN COMMUNITY SAFETY FROM THE HOME OUT RATHER THAN FROM THE WILD LANDS AND WE KNOW THAT PRUNING AND REMOVING VEGETATION. FROM A HUNDRED FEET SURROUNDING A HOME IS VITAL TO SAVING A HOME AND POTENTIALLY THE PEOPLE AND THAT. WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF SIN OF SYMBOL PRODUCTS FROM ATTIC VENTS SCREENS TO GUTTER COVERS TO FIRE RESISTANT SHINGLES AND CITING. THAT ARE EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE AT SAVING HOMES FROM WILDFIRES WE ALSO KNOW THAT MANY OF THE PEOPLE LIVING IN THE WILD AND URBAN INTERFACE. LACKED THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO TAKE EVEN THESE SIMPLE STEPS TO SAVING THEIR HOMES AND COMMUNITIES. TO THIS END WE URGE YOU TO DIRECT FUEL MANAGEMENT AND WHILE FAR PREPAREDNESS FUNDS TO ASSIST LOW INCOME AND DISADVANTAGED CALIFORNIANS PERFORM DEFENSIBLE SPACE TREATMENTS.
