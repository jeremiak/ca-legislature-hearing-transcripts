00:38:05.082 --> 00:38:06.450
AMOUNT OF RISK.

00:38:06.517 --> 00:38:07.652

AREA THAT MEANS THERE'S A ONE IN

00:42:59.944 --> 00:43:01.312

00:43:30.774 --> 00:43:33.243
HAVE QUITE A BIT OF RISK ACROSS

00:43:33.310 --> 00:43:34.478

00:44:01.739 --> 00:44:03.240
LEVEES AND FLOOD MANAGEMENT

00:44:03.307 --> 00:44:04.842
STRUCTURES DEVELOPING LAND USE

00:44:04.908 --> 00:44:05.909
POLICIES.

00:44:05.976 --> 00:44:07.244
PLANNING AND LEADING EMERGENCY

00:44:07.311 --> 00:44:09.013
RESPONSE AND THEN GENERATING A

00:44:09.079 --> 00:44:11.181
LOT OF THE FUNDING THAT'S USED

00:44:11.248 --> 00:44:11.949
FOR FLOOD MANAGEMENT.

00:44:12.016 --> 00:44:13.650
AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THERE ARE

00:44:13.717 --> 00:44:14.885
TWO MAIN AGENCIES INVOLVED THE

00:44:14.952 --> 00:44:16.854
US ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS AND

00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:18.589
FEMA THE FEDERAL EMERGENCY

00:44:18.655 --> 00:44:20.457
MANAGEMENT AGENCY.

00:44:20.524 --> 00:44:22.126
I HAVE THE THE US ARMY CORPS

00:44:22.192 --> 00:44:24.161
GENERALLY IS CONSTRUCTING SOME

00:44:24.228 --> 00:44:25.896
LARGE PROJECTS AND THEN TURNING

00:44:25.963 --> 00:44:28.032
OVER THE DAILY OPERATIONS AND

00:44:28.098 --> 00:44:29.967
MAINTENANCE TO THEIR NON FEDERAL

00:44:30.034 --> 00:44:31.902
SPONSORS TO PART PARTNERS EITHER

00:44:31.969 --> 00:44:33.237
AT THE LOCAL LEVEL OUR STATE

00:44:33.303 --> 00:44:35.572
AGENCY LEVEL -- BUT THEY DO

00:44:35.639 --> 00:44:36.974
TYPICALLY MAINTAIN REGULATORY

00:44:37.041 --> 00:44:38.609
AUTHORITY OVER THOSE STRUCTURES

00:44:38.675 --> 00:44:41.145
CAM INCLUDING SETTING STANDARDS.

00:44:41.211 --> 00:44:44.281
AND THEY WILL COME IN AND REPAIR

00:44:44.348 --> 00:44:45.582
FLOOD DAMAGE LEVEES BUT ONLY FOR

00:44:45.649 --> 00:44:46.850
THOSE LEVEES HAVE MET CERTAIN

00:44:46.917 --> 00:44:48.285
STANDARDS AND I THINK YOU'LL

00:44:48.352 --> 00:44:49.686
PROBABLY HEAR ABOUT THAT AND

00:44:49.753 --> 00:44:49.987
SUBSEQUENT.

00:44:50.054 --> 00:44:52.790
PANELS -- FEMA COMES IN IF THERE

00:44:52.856 --> 00:44:53.924
ARE EMERGENCIES AND ALSO

00:44:53.991 --> 00:44:54.958
OPERATES THE NATIONAL FLOOD

00:44:55.025 --> 00:44:56.560
INSURANCE PROGRAM AND THEN AT

00:44:56.627 --> 00:44:58.028
THE STATE LEVEL AS YOU'LL HEAR

00:44:58.095 --> 00:45:00.664
FROM ALL OF THESE AGENCIES TODAY.

00:45:00.731 --> 00:45:01.865
I DID HAVE YOU ARE IS OUR LEAD

00:45:01.932 --> 00:45:03.333
AGENCY IN FLOOD RELATED

00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:05.569
PREPARATIONS FOR CASTING AND

00:45:05.636 --> 00:45:07.271
RESPONSE AND ALSO HAS

00:45:07.337 --> 00:45:09.473
RESPONSIBILITIES OVER -- THAT

00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:10.641
CENTRAL VALLEY.

00:45:10.707 --> 00:45:12.242
FLOOD SYSTEM OVER WHICH THE

00:45:12.309 --> 00:45:12.910
STATE HAS SPECIAL

00:45:12.976 --> 00:45:14.311
RESPONSIBILITIES KNOWN AS THE

00:45:14.378 --> 00:45:15.946
STATE PLAN OF FLOOD CONTROL OF

00:45:16.013 --> 00:45:17.314
TALK ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT OF

00:45:17.381 --> 00:45:18.615
DETAIL IN A MOMENT -- THE

00:45:18.682 --> 00:45:20.117
CENTRAL VALLEY FLOOD PROTECTION

00:45:20.184 --> 00:45:21.652
BOARD OVERSEAS AND REGULATES

00:45:21.718 --> 00:45:24.021
THAT SYSTEM AND THEN -- THE

00:45:24.088 --> 00:45:25.589
OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES

00:45:25.656 --> 00:45:30.694
HELPS IN RESPONDING TO AND

00:45:30.761 --> 00:45:32.563
PREPARING FOR FLOOD DISASTERS.

00:45:32.629 --> 00:45:32.996
SO TURNING TO PAGE.

00:45:33.063 --> 00:45:33.397
THREE MOST OF THIS

00:45:33.464 --> 00:45:34.665
INFRASTRUCTURE IS LOCALLY OWNED

00:45:34.731 --> 00:45:36.767
AND MANAGED -- ALTHOUGH THE

00:45:36.834 --> 00:45:37.734
STATE DOES HAVE SPECIAL

00:45:37.801 --> 00:45:40.037
RESPONSIBILITY OVER AT THIS

00:45:40.104 --> 00:45:41.438
STATE PLAN A FLOOD CONTROL

00:45:41.505 --> 00:45:42.372
SYSTEM.

00:45:42.439 --> 00:45:44.508
AND I'VE GOT HIGHLIGHTED ON PAGE

00:45:44.575 --> 00:45:46.043
FOUR YOU CAN SEE A MAP THAT

00:45:46.110 --> 00:45:47.978
OUTLINES WHERE WHAT THAT STATE

00:45:48.045 --> 00:45:49.680
PLAN A FLOOD CONTROL SYSTEM

00:45:49.746 --> 00:45:51.181
LOOKS LIKE IN WHICH WHERE THOSE

00:45:51.248 --> 00:45:52.516
LEVEES ARE.

00:45:52.583 --> 00:45:54.384
AS YOU CAN SEE THEY'RE MOSTLY

00:45:54.451 --> 00:45:55.752
ALONG THE MAIN STEM OF THE

00:45:55.819 --> 00:45:57.521
SACRAMENTO RIVER AND SAN JOAQUIN

00:45:57.588 --> 00:45:58.956
RIVER IF YOU LOOK AT THE DELTA

00:45:59.022 --> 00:46:00.257
THERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MAP

00:46:00.324 --> 00:46:02.092
YOU CAN SEE THERE AREN'T A LOT

00:46:02.159 --> 00:46:02.392
[inaudible]

00:46:02.459 --> 00:46:04.161
MANY.

00:46:04.228 --> 00:46:05.596
STATE RESPONSIBILITY LEVEES

00:46:05.662 --> 00:46:07.998
WITHIN THAT SYSTEM SO IT'S

00:46:08.065 --> 00:46:09.500
MOSTLY ON THE MAIN STEM BUT BUT

00:46:09.566 --> 00:46:10.968
THERE ARE SOME PATCHWORK

00:46:11.034 --> 00:46:12.936
SURROUND OTHER PARTS OF IT -- I

00:46:13.003 --> 00:46:14.571
CAN DEFERRED A SUBSEQUENT PANELS

00:46:14.638 --> 00:46:16.340
TO TALK ABOUT HOW THE SYSTEM

00:46:16.406 --> 00:46:18.976
CAME ABOUT BUT THE IN THE

00:46:19.042 --> 00:46:20.377
OVERVIEW IS THAT.

00:46:20.444 --> 00:46:21.612
WHILE MOST OF THESE LEVEES WERE

00:46:21.678 --> 00:46:24.414
ACTUALLY ORIGINALLY DEVELOPED BY

00:46:24.481 --> 00:46:25.816
PRIVATE CITIZENS PUSHING SAND

00:46:25.883 --> 00:46:27.217
AND SOILS TOGETHER DURING THE

00:46:27.284 --> 00:46:28.085
GOLD RUSH.

00:46:28.152 --> 00:46:29.353
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THEN CAME

00:46:29.419 --> 00:46:31.021
IN IN THE EARLY PART OF THE

00:46:31.088 --> 00:46:33.323
NINETEEN HUNDREDS AND AND HELPED --

00:46:33.390 --> 00:46:35.092
DEVELOP THEM IN THIS PROJECT AND

00:46:35.159 --> 00:46:36.460
THEN THE STATE TOOK OVER

00:46:36.527 --> 00:46:37.694
RESPONSIBILITY IN THE MID

00:46:37.761 --> 00:46:39.396
FIFTIES AND GIVE ASSURANCES TO

00:46:39.463 --> 00:46:40.264
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT WE

00:46:40.330 --> 00:46:41.498
AS THE STATE WOULD.

00:46:41.565 --> 00:46:43.600
BE RESPONSIBLE FOR OVERSEEING

00:46:43.667 --> 00:46:45.369
THIS SYSTEM AND THERE WAS AN

00:46:45.435 --> 00:46:47.504
IMPORTANT LAWSUIT IN TWO

00:46:47.571 --> 00:46:48.172
THOUSAND THREE THE TURNOVER SCAB

00:46:48.238 --> 00:46:50.807
VERSUS CALIFORNIA COURT DECISION.

00:46:50.874 --> 00:46:52.576
THAT REALLY ESTABLISHED -- THAT

00:46:52.643 --> 00:46:56.346
THE STATE HAS SPECIALIZED THAT

00:46:56.413 --> 00:46:58.081
LADY OVER THESE SYSTEMS.

00:46:58.148 --> 00:46:59.650
YOU DRIVE A LITTLE DEEPER TO

00:46:59.716 --> 00:47:01.518
EXPLAIN WHY -- WHAT THE PROMISE

00:47:01.585 --> 00:47:02.920
LAWSUIT ONCE?

00:47:02.986 --> 00:47:04.354
WELL AND I MAY DEFER TO MY

00:47:04.421 --> 00:47:05.289
COLLEAGUES WHO HAVE MORE

00:47:05.355 --> 00:47:06.690
EXPERTISE ON THIS BUT I'LL I'LL

00:47:06.757 --> 00:47:07.724
I'LL GIVE THEM A SHOT AND THEN

00:47:07.791 --> 00:47:08.392
AND THEN PERHAPS TURNED OVER IF

00:47:08.458 --> 00:47:10.494
THAT'S ALRIGHT -- BUT THERE WAS

00:47:10.561 --> 00:47:12.229
A LEVEE FAILURE THERE AND THERE

00:47:12.296 --> 00:47:13.830
WAS A COURT DECISION THAT FOUND

00:47:13.897 --> 00:47:15.132
THAT IT WAS THE STATE'S

00:47:15.199 --> 00:47:16.400
RESPONSIBILITY EVEN THOUGH.

00:47:16.466 --> 00:47:18.135
THE LEVEES HAD NEVER BEEN UP TO

00:47:18.202 --> 00:47:19.736
IN MODERN ENGINEERING STANDARDS

00:47:19.803 --> 00:47:21.004
THE COURT STILL FOUND THAT THE

00:47:21.071 --> 00:47:22.005
STATE KNEW THAT AND THEN

00:47:22.072 --> 00:47:22.973
THEREFORE HAD SOME

00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:25.742
RESPONSIBILITY -- TO MAKE SURE

00:47:25.809 --> 00:47:30.948
THAT THEY WERE IN OPERATIONAL.

00:47:31.014 --> 00:47:32.416
FOR ANYTHING THAT I GOT THE

00:47:32.482 --> 00:47:35.419
THUMBS UP THAT COVERAGE -- SO.

00:47:35.485 --> 00:47:36.019
THAT DID ESTABLISH THIS STATE

00:47:36.086 --> 00:47:38.088
LIABILITY FOR MAINTAINING THIS

00:47:38.155 --> 00:47:39.089
THIS SYSTEM.

00:47:39.156 --> 00:47:40.824
ALTHOUGH THE STATE HAS THIS

00:47:40.891 --> 00:47:43.493
RESPONSIBILITY AND LIABILITY WE

00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:45.329
HAVE IS TO ESTABLISH MAINTAINING

00:47:45.395 --> 00:47:46.997
RELATIONSHIPS AND AGREEMENTS

00:47:47.064 --> 00:47:48.832
WITH AGENCIES ACROSS THE STATE

00:47:48.899 --> 00:47:50.500
TO DO THE OPERATIONS AND

00:47:50.567 --> 00:47:52.269
MAINTENANCE OVER THOSE SYSTEMS --

00:47:52.336 --> 00:47:53.837
AND I THINK YOU'LL HEAR FROM

00:47:53.904 --> 00:47:55.005
SOME OF FROM ONE OF THOSE

00:47:55.072 --> 00:47:57.241
AGENCIES LATER AND YOUR PANEL AS

00:47:57.307 --> 00:47:58.475
WELL.

00:47:58.542 --> 00:47:59.309
SO EVEN THOUGH WE TALK A LOT

00:47:59.376 --> 00:48:02.212
ABOUT THESE STRUCTURES -- TO

00:48:02.279 --> 00:48:05.315
CONTROL FLOOD WATERS THERE ARE

00:48:05.382 --> 00:48:07.117
ALSO OTHER -- APPROACHES THAT

00:48:07.184 --> 00:48:08.418
THE STATE CAN TAKE AND LOCAL

00:48:08.485 --> 00:48:11.321
AGENCIES TAKE TO MANAGE FLOOD

00:48:11.388 --> 00:48:14.558
WATERS -- WHICH INCLUDE.

00:48:14.625 --> 00:48:16.026
ACTUALLY LETTING THE WATER FLOW

00:48:16.093 --> 00:48:21.064
AND CREATING WIDER AND AND

00:48:21.131 --> 00:48:22.566
BROADER AREAS FOR THE FLOOD

00:48:22.633 --> 00:48:25.736
WATERS TO SLOW TO SPREAD TO SYNC.

00:48:25.802 --> 00:48:27.037
AND WE FOUND THAT THAT HAS A LOT

00:48:27.104 --> 00:48:28.972
OF OTHER BENEFITS IT CAN BENEFIT

00:48:29.039 --> 00:48:30.774
FISH AND WILDLIFE HABITAT AND

00:48:30.841 --> 00:48:33.744
ALSO -- EVEN WATER SUPPLY WHEN

00:48:33.810 --> 00:48:35.479
IT REPLENISHES GROUNDWATER -- UP

00:48:35.545 --> 00:48:36.580
THE FIRST SO THAT'S BEEN A

00:48:36.647 --> 00:48:38.081
REALLY MAJOR PUSH OF THE STATE

00:48:38.148 --> 00:48:39.650
IN RECENT YEARS AND I THINK

00:48:39.716 --> 00:48:40.651
YOU'LL HEAR ABOUT THAT SOME FROM

00:48:40.717 --> 00:48:42.919
SUBSEQUENT PANELISTS AS WELL. TO

00:48:42.986 --> 00:48:45.589
LOOK AT OTHER OPTIONS FOR TRYING

00:48:45.656 --> 00:48:47.557
TO MANAGE OUR FLOOD WATERS.

00:48:47.624 --> 00:48:49.760
SO SKIPPING OVER PASSED THE MAP

00:48:49.826 --> 00:48:51.228
TO PAGE FIVE TALKING ABOUT

00:48:51.295 --> 00:48:52.996
FUNDING FOR A MOMENT THERE ARE

00:48:53.063 --> 00:48:54.798
WIDE RANGES OF ESTIMATES ON HOW

00:48:54.865 --> 00:48:56.533
MUCH IS SPENT ANNUALLY ON FLOOD

00:48:56.600 --> 00:48:58.735
MANAGEMENT -- ACROSS THE STATE

00:48:58.802 --> 00:49:00.237
ESTIMATES RANGE BETWEEN TWO IN

00:49:00.304 --> 00:49:02.039
THREE BILLION DOLLARS AS IS TRUE

00:49:02.105 --> 00:49:03.340
WITH MOST WATER RELATED

00:49:03.407 --> 00:49:05.075
ACTIVITIES IN THE STATE MOST OF

00:49:05.142 --> 00:49:06.943
THIS IS FROM THE LOCAL LEVEL --

00:49:07.010 --> 00:49:09.079
AND MOST OF THAT THAT LARGEST

00:49:09.146 --> 00:49:10.714
SOURCES PROPERTY TAXES AND

00:49:10.781 --> 00:49:12.149
POPERTY ASSESSMENTS BUT THEIR

00:49:12.215 --> 00:49:14.051
LOCAL LOCALS GENERATE FUNDS IN

00:49:14.117 --> 00:49:15.452
VARIOUS FORMS.

00:49:15.519 --> 00:49:16.386
THERE IS SOME FUNDING FROM THE

00:49:16.453 --> 00:49:17.587
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AS WELL

00:49:17.654 --> 00:49:19.456
ESTIMATES ARE IN THE HUNDREDS OF

00:49:19.523 --> 00:49:21.825
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ANNUALLY THE

00:49:21.892 --> 00:49:22.993
LARGEST PIECE OF THAT COMES IN

00:49:23.060 --> 00:49:24.928
THOSE LARGE PROJECTS THAT THE US

00:49:24.995 --> 00:49:26.463
ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS

00:49:26.530 --> 00:49:27.964
CONSTRUCTS -- THERE'S ALSO

00:49:28.031 --> 00:49:30.233
SPENDING FOR DISASTER RESPONSE

00:49:30.300 --> 00:49:31.835
AND THEN FROM THE STATE THE

00:49:31.902 --> 00:49:33.503
LARGEST SOURCES BOND FUNDS YOU

00:49:33.570 --> 00:49:35.372
CAN SEE HERE IN THE CHART AT THE

00:49:35.439 --> 00:49:37.441
BOTTOM OF PAGE -- FIVE SOME OF

00:49:37.507 --> 00:49:39.076
THEIR RECENT ACROSS THE LAST TWO

00:49:39.142 --> 00:49:43.146
DECADES BONDS THAT HAVE PROVIDED.

00:49:43.213 --> 00:49:44.147
FOR FIVE POINT SIX BILLIONS OF

00:49:44.214 --> 00:49:46.316
DOLLARS BILLION DOLLARS IN

00:49:46.383 --> 00:49:47.517
FUNDING FOR FLOOD MANAGEMENT

00:49:47.584 --> 00:49:48.719
TYPE OF ACTIVITIES THESE FUNDS

00:49:48.785 --> 00:49:50.187
ARE STILL BEING SPENT RIGHT NOW

00:49:50.253 --> 00:49:52.089
ESPECIALLY SOME OF THE MORE

00:49:52.155 --> 00:49:53.056
RECENT ONES.

00:49:53.123 --> 00:49:54.391
IN ADDITION TO BONDS ARE ALSO

00:49:54.458 --> 00:49:56.126
SOMETIMES IS GENERAL FUND

00:49:56.193 --> 00:49:57.894
PROVIDED FOR FLOOD MANAGEMENT --

00:49:57.961 --> 00:49:58.962
AN EXAMPLE OF THAT IS THE MOST

00:49:59.029 --> 00:50:01.465
RECENT BUDGET.

00:50:01.531 --> 00:50:01.998
TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN BUT

00:50:02.065 --> 00:50:03.300
PROVIDED A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY

00:50:03.367 --> 00:50:05.435
MILLION IN GENERAL FUND FOR

00:50:05.502 --> 00:50:06.970
MATCHING FUNDS FOR TO SOME LARGE

00:50:07.037 --> 00:50:08.572
FEDERAL PROJECTS A HUNDRED

00:50:08.638 --> 00:50:09.906
MILLION IN ONE TIME FUNDING FOR

00:50:09.973 --> 00:50:11.108
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE ON LEVEES

00:50:11.174 --> 00:50:12.442
IN THAT STATE PLAN A FLOOD

00:50:12.509 --> 00:50:13.577
CONTROL SYSTEM.

00:50:13.643 --> 00:50:15.145
AND TWENTY FIVE MILLION ONGOING

00:50:15.212 --> 00:50:16.546
GENERAL FUND FOR INCREASED

00:50:16.613 --> 00:50:20.484
MAINTENANCE FOR A DEPARTMENT OF

00:50:20.550 --> 00:50:21.585
WATER RESOURCES ON THAT SYSTEM.

00:50:21.651 --> 00:50:22.719
AND THEN FINALLY TURNING TO PAGE

00:50:22.786 --> 00:50:23.820
SIX JUST HIGHLIGHTING SOME OF

00:50:23.887 --> 00:50:25.155
THE FLOOD MANAGEMENT CHALLENGES

00:50:25.222 --> 00:50:26.556
IN CALIFORNIA I'M SURE YOU'LL

00:50:26.623 --> 00:50:27.991
HEAR MORE ABOUT THIS IN YOUR

00:50:28.058 --> 00:50:29.626
SUBSEQUENT PANELS AS WELL.

00:50:29.693 --> 00:50:30.927
FIRST BEING THAT OUR

00:50:30.994 --> 00:50:32.929
INFRASTRUCTURE IS OLD -- ARE

00:50:32.996 --> 00:50:34.331
LEVEES MANY OF OUR LEVEES ARE

00:50:34.398 --> 00:50:35.699
OVER A HUNDRED AND TWO YEARS OLD

00:50:35.766 --> 00:50:37.734
AND WERE NOT DESIGNED ACCORDING

00:50:37.801 --> 00:50:39.536
TO MODERN DESIGN STANDARDS EVEN

00:50:39.603 --> 00:50:42.038
IN THE FIRST PLACE WE SAW.

00:50:42.105 --> 00:50:43.874
THE EFFECTS OF WHAT HAPPENED OR

00:50:43.940 --> 00:50:45.542
A BILL DAM A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO

00:50:45.609 --> 00:50:47.644
THAT SHOW BOTH -- THE RISK OF

00:50:47.711 --> 00:50:48.879
SOME OF OUR EXISTING AGING

00:50:48.945 --> 00:50:51.148
INFRASTRUCTURE BUT ALSO ARE

00:50:51.214 --> 00:50:52.182
CRITICAL DEPENDENCE ON IT.

00:50:52.249 --> 00:50:53.517
AND NOT ONLY THIS INFRASTRUCTURE

00:50:53.583 --> 00:50:55.118
ALL BUT WHEN IT WAS DESIGNED IT

00:50:55.185 --> 00:50:56.420
DIDN'T WASN'T NECESSARILY

00:50:56.486 --> 00:50:58.889
DESIGNED FOR THE TYPES OF GOALS

00:50:58.955 --> 00:50:59.489
AND CONDITIONS THAT WE FACE

00:50:59.556 --> 00:51:00.590
TODAY.

00:51:00.657 --> 00:51:01.725
A LOT OF THE ORIGINAL GOALS OF

00:51:01.792 --> 00:51:03.059
THE FLOOD MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE

00:51:03.126 --> 00:51:04.895
WAS GETTING THE WATER OUT TO THE

00:51:04.961 --> 00:51:07.397
SEA AS FAST AS POSSIBLE AND NOW

00:51:07.464 --> 00:51:08.365
WE KNOW THAT.

00:51:08.432 --> 00:51:10.267
THAT HAS NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON

00:51:10.333 --> 00:51:11.735
FISH AND WILDLIFE AND ALSO EVEN

00:51:11.802 --> 00:51:13.770
ON ON WATER SUPPLY IN SOME CASES

00:51:13.837 --> 00:51:16.273
SO TRYING TO RE ENVISION HOW WE

00:51:16.339 --> 00:51:18.442
HANDLE FLOOD WATERS TO ACHIEVE

00:51:18.508 --> 00:51:20.510
OTHER BENEFITS -- WE'VE OUTSIDE

00:51:20.577 --> 00:51:21.945
A LOT OF POPULATION GROWTH FOR

00:51:22.012 --> 00:51:23.480
FACING CHANGING CLIMATE SO A LOT

00:51:23.547 --> 00:51:25.348
OF A LOT OF CHANGING FACTORS

00:51:25.415 --> 00:51:26.983
THAT HAVE COME INTO PLAY SINCE

00:51:27.050 --> 00:51:28.885
THAT FLOOD INFRASTRUCTURE WAS

00:51:28.952 --> 00:51:32.088
DEVELOPED -- THIRD OUR NEEDS ARE

00:51:32.155 --> 00:51:33.557
GREAT BUT FUNDING IS LIMITED AND

00:51:33.623 --> 00:51:35.025
WE HAVE A FEW EXAMPLES HERE OF

00:51:35.091 --> 00:51:36.860
SOME OF THE CONSTRAINTS ON ON

00:51:36.927 --> 00:51:38.495
GENERATING FUNDING FOR FLOOD

00:51:38.562 --> 00:51:39.863
MANAGEMENT.

00:51:39.930 --> 00:51:40.997
LAND USE COMES INTO PLAY

00:51:41.064 --> 00:51:42.332
ESPECIALLY THE GROWING

00:51:42.399 --> 00:51:45.168
POPULATION AND WHERE THAT

00:51:45.235 --> 00:51:46.636
DEVELOPMENT HAPPENS.

00:51:46.703 --> 00:51:48.872
AND THEN FINALLY I THINK ONE OF

00:51:48.939 --> 00:51:50.307
THE OTHER ISSUES YOU'LL HEAR

00:51:50.373 --> 00:51:51.675
ABOUT TODAY IS THERE ARE SO MANY

00:51:51.741 --> 00:51:53.677
AGENCIES INVOLVED IN FLOOD

00:51:53.743 --> 00:51:55.011

00:51:55.078 --> 00:51:56.246
OF TIMES COORDINATING ACROSS

00:51:56.313 --> 00:51:58.014

00:51:58.081 --> 00:51:59.683
FOR FUNDING FOR TIMING.

00:51:59.749 --> 00:52:01.551
CAN CREATE CHALLENGES AS WELL SO

00:52:01.618 --> 00:52:02.786
HOPEFULLY THAT PROVIDE SOME

00:52:02.853 --> 00:52:03.420

OUT HERE WE ARE LOOKING AT WHAT

00:54:06.476 --> 00:54:08.511
IS OFTEN CALLED THE STAIR STEP

00:54:08.578 --> 00:54:09.746
OR MANAGING RESIDUAL RISK

00:54:09.813 --> 00:54:11.314
GRAPHIC THIS IS ADAPTED FROM A

00:54:11.381 --> 00:54:12.849
DOCUMENT THAT FEDERAL AGENCIES

00:54:12.916 --> 00:54:14.384
HAVE BEEN USING FOR DECADES TO

00:54:14.451 --> 00:54:15.151
DESCRIBE.

00:54:15.218 --> 00:54:16.953
WHAT WE DO FOR PORTFOLIO

00:54:17.020 --> 00:54:18.788
MANAGEMENT TO BUY DOWN RISK THE

00:54:18.855 --> 00:54:20.557
KEY POINTS HERE IS THAT THERE IS

00:54:20.624 --> 00:54:22.292
ALWAYS FLOOD RISK IT'S A

00:54:22.359 --> 00:54:23.627
MISNOMER THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY

00:54:23.693 --> 00:54:25.295
ELIMINATE OR CONTROL FLOOD

00:54:25.362 --> 00:54:25.929
WATERS?

00:54:25.996 --> 00:54:27.297
THE THE THE GOAL OF ALL AGENCIES

00:54:27.364 --> 00:54:29.866
IS TO MAKE INVESTMENTS AT THE

00:54:29.933 --> 00:54:31.568
FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL LEVELS

00:54:31.635 --> 00:54:32.902
TO BUY DOWN THOSE RISKS THROUGH

00:54:32.969 --> 00:54:33.970
PORTFOLIOS OF ACTIONS THAT

00:54:34.037 --> 00:54:35.071
INCLUDE ACTUAL STRUCTURAL

00:54:35.138 --> 00:54:36.306
ACTIONS.

00:54:36.373 --> 00:54:37.907
AS WELL AS WHAT WE WOULD CALL

00:54:37.974 --> 00:54:39.275
MANAGEMENT OR NONSTRUCTURAL

00:54:39.342 --> 00:54:40.810
ACTIONS THERE ARE A HOST OF

00:54:40.877 --> 00:54:42.112
THOSE THINGS INCLUDING BUILDING

00:54:42.178 --> 00:54:43.947
DAMS RESERVOIRS -- BUILDING A

00:54:44.014 --> 00:54:45.315
CONSTRUCTING AND MAINTAINING

00:54:45.382 --> 00:54:47.217
LEVEES HAVING FORECASTING

00:54:47.283 --> 00:54:48.551
PROGRAMS COORDINATING ENSURING

00:54:48.618 --> 00:54:49.719
THE INFORMATION FROM THOSE

00:54:49.786 --> 00:54:51.254
FORECASTING PROGRAMS.

00:54:51.321 --> 00:54:53.156
HAVING FLOOD INSURANCE -- AS A

00:54:53.223 --> 00:54:54.424
MEANS TO PROTECT PRIVATE

00:54:54.491 --> 00:54:56.026
CITIZENS -- ZONING AND BUILDING

00:54:56.092 --> 00:54:57.627
CODES WHERE WE CAN ACTUALLY MOVE

00:54:57.694 --> 00:54:58.995
PEOPLE AWAY FROM HARM.

00:54:59.062 --> 00:55:00.597
AND THEN -- ALSO IN THERE IS

00:55:00.664 --> 00:55:02.198
TRAINING IN BUILDING EXERCISES

00:55:02.265 --> 00:55:03.266
SO THAT WHEN A FLOOD EVENT

00:55:03.333 --> 00:55:05.168
HAPPENS THE RESPOND AS WELL AS

00:55:05.235 --> 00:55:08.538
LOCAL COMMUNITIES KNOW WHAT THEY

00:55:08.605 --> 00:55:09.439
CAN GO THROUGH AND DO -- IT IN

00:55:09.506 --> 00:55:10.340
THE CONTEXT OF THE STATE OF

00:55:10.407 --> 00:55:11.808
CALIFORNIA -- JUST SOME NUMBERS

00:55:11.875 --> 00:55:13.510
OUT THERE THEY'RE OVER TWELVE

00:55:13.576 --> 00:55:15.245
HUNDRED REGULATORY DAMS FOR THE

00:55:15.311 --> 00:55:17.113
STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- MOST OF

00:55:17.180 --> 00:55:18.381
THESE ARE ACTUALLY QUITE SMALL

00:55:18.448 --> 00:55:19.749
THEY DO NOT ACTUALLY HAVE A

00:55:19.816 --> 00:55:21.117
DEDICATED FLOOD CONTROL

00:55:21.184 --> 00:55:23.053
OPERATION OR DESIGN WITHIN THEM

00:55:23.119 --> 00:55:24.521
BUT THEY DO POSE SOME ADDITIONAL

00:55:24.587 --> 00:55:25.755
RISK OUT THERE THERE'S

00:55:25.822 --> 00:55:27.290
ADDITIONALLY FOR COORDINATION --

00:55:27.357 --> 00:55:29.526
THERE OVER FOURTEEN THOUSAND

00:55:29.592 --> 00:55:31.094
MILES OF LEVEES IN THE STATE OF

00:55:31.161 --> 00:55:32.796
CALIFORNIA ONLY SIXTEEN HUNDRED

00:55:32.862 --> 00:55:35.031
OF WHICH THE STATE ACTUALLY

00:55:35.098 --> 00:55:38.134
MAINTAINS AND OWNS THE MAJORITY

00:55:38.201 --> 00:55:38.768
OF THESE ARE LOCALLY MAINTAINED

00:55:38.835 --> 00:55:40.370
AND THERE OVER A THOUSAND

00:55:40.437 --> 00:55:41.604
DIFFERENT AGENCIES WITH WATER

00:55:41.671 --> 00:55:43.106
MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES.

00:55:43.173 --> 00:55:44.774
THAT OVERLAP INTO FLOOD

00:55:44.841 --> 00:55:46.643
MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES WITH

00:55:46.710 --> 00:55:48.545
ALL OF THIS IN MIND THE LARGEST

00:55:48.611 --> 00:55:50.613
ROLE THE STATE HAS ACTUALLY IS

00:55:50.680 --> 00:55:51.781
IMPROVING THE LOCAL CAPACITY TO

00:55:51.848 --> 00:55:53.183
REDUCE FLOOD RISK IN BY IT DOWN

00:55:53.249 --> 00:55:54.084
OVER TIME.

00:55:54.150 --> 00:55:55.752
AND THE PRIMARY MEANS OF DOING

00:55:55.819 --> 00:55:57.921
THIS IS EFFECTIVELY COORDINATION

00:55:57.987 --> 00:55:59.456
AND DISSEMINATING INFORMATION

00:55:59.522 --> 00:56:00.356
AND THEN BUILDING THROUGH

00:56:00.423 --> 00:56:02.659
EXERCISES AND TRAINING PROGRAMS.

00:56:02.726 --> 00:56:04.761
THAT LOCAL CAPACITY TO RESPOND

00:56:04.828 --> 00:56:05.962
QUICKLY TO FLOOD EVENTS

00:56:06.029 --> 00:56:07.297
HISTORICALLY THE STATE HAS NOT

00:56:07.363 --> 00:56:09.132
GOT INTO THIS BROADER GOAL OF

00:56:09.199 --> 00:56:10.366
ACTUALLY GOING IN ACTIVELY

00:56:10.433 --> 00:56:11.701
MANAGING THE FLOODS OUT THERE

00:56:11.768 --> 00:56:13.403
BECAUSE OF THE EXPANSIVE THE

00:56:13.470 --> 00:56:14.604
STATE ITSELF IS SO LARGER BE

00:56:14.671 --> 00:56:16.806
COSTLY TO MOVE.

00:56:16.873 --> 00:56:19.175
PEOPLE IN PERSONAL OUT THERE.

00:56:19.242 --> 00:56:20.477
I THANK MIKE.

00:56:20.543 --> 00:56:21.444
X. WE'RE GONNA GO THROUGH --

00:56:21.511 --> 00:56:23.046
MORE IN DEPTH OVERVIEW OF THE

00:56:23.113 --> 00:56:24.114
STATE PLAN A FLOOD CONTROL

00:56:24.180 --> 00:56:25.582
SYSTEM -- THAT RITUAL AT A

00:56:25.648 --> 00:56:27.383
ALLUDED TO EARLIER AND SO IF YOU

00:56:27.450 --> 00:56:30.320
LOOK TO THE NEXT FIGURE -- HARMS

00:56:30.386 --> 00:56:32.856
IS UPSIDE DOWN AFTER -- SO THE

00:56:32.922 --> 00:56:33.389
FIGURE ON THE TOP OF THE

00:56:33.456 --> 00:56:34.357
SACRAMENTO RIVER FLOOD CONTROL

00:56:34.424 --> 00:56:36.126
PROJECT AND IN THE FIGURE ON THE

00:56:36.192 --> 00:56:37.360
BOTTOM IS THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER

00:56:37.427 --> 00:56:39.162
FLOOD CONTROL PROJECT.

00:56:39.229 --> 00:56:40.697
AND WITHIN THESE TWO PROJECTS

00:56:40.764 --> 00:56:41.798
OTHERS OVER ONE POINT THREE

00:56:41.865 --> 00:56:42.832
MILLION PEOPLE LIVING WITHIN THE

00:56:42.899 --> 00:56:44.667
FLOOD PLAINS EIGHTY BILLION

00:56:44.734 --> 00:56:46.903
DOLLARS WITH THE PROPERTY AND

00:56:46.970 --> 00:56:48.071
ASSETS THAT ARE AT RISK. FIVE

00:56:48.138 --> 00:56:50.607
MAJOR URBAN CENTERS AND DOZENS

00:56:50.673 --> 00:56:52.709
ABOUT FORTY PLUS SMALL COMMUNITY

00:56:52.776 --> 00:56:53.510
CENTER.

00:56:53.576 --> 00:56:55.311
AND END DOZENS OF ENDANGERED

00:56:55.378 --> 00:56:58.248
SPECIES THAT ARE -- PROTECTED BY

00:56:58.314 --> 00:56:58.848
THE STATE PLAN A FLOOD CONTROL

00:56:58.915 --> 00:56:59.415
SYSTEM.

00:56:59.482 --> 00:57:00.750
AND THE THIRD ARE THERE ARE SOME

00:57:00.817 --> 00:57:01.684
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE

00:57:01.751 --> 00:57:03.086
SACRAMENTO SYSTEM AND THE SAN

00:57:03.153 --> 00:57:05.355
JOAQUIN RIVER SYSTEM OF A

00:57:05.421 --> 00:57:06.823
SACRAMENTO SYSTEM IS RAIN DRIVEN.

00:57:06.890 --> 00:57:08.124
WHERE THE SAME WORKING SYSTEM IS

00:57:08.191 --> 00:57:10.026
MORE SNOW MELT DRIVEN AS WAS A

00:57:10.093 --> 00:57:12.495
SHARED AT THE IF THE

00:57:12.562 --> 00:57:13.029
INTRODUCTION OF THE OF THE

00:57:13.096 --> 00:57:14.364
COMMITTEE?

00:57:14.430 --> 00:57:15.732
HAPPENED THE NORTHERN SIERRA YOU

00:57:15.799 --> 00:57:16.499
CAN EXPECT ABOUT FIFTY INTO THE

00:57:16.566 --> 00:57:18.334
PRECIP ON AVERAGE PER YEAR

00:57:18.401 --> 00:57:19.669
RESIDENTS SOUTHERN SIERRA AS

00:57:19.736 --> 00:57:21.437
YOU'D EXPECT ABOUT THIRTY INCHES

00:57:21.504 --> 00:57:23.506
A PRESET PER YEAR.

00:57:23.573 --> 00:57:25.208
AND CALIFORNIA RECEIVED ABOUT

00:57:25.275 --> 00:57:26.009
TWO THIRDS OF THE TOTAL

00:57:26.075 --> 00:57:28.211
PRECIPITATION FROM THE SIERRA

00:57:28.278 --> 00:57:31.748
NEVADA MOUNTAIN RANGE -- GOING

00:57:31.815 --> 00:57:34.317
THROUGH UP THE BIG PIECE OF THE

00:57:34.384 --> 00:57:35.485
THE CITY GETS A SYSTEM OF

00:57:35.552 --> 00:57:36.953
SYSTEMS WE HAVE THE RESERVOIR

00:57:37.020 --> 00:57:39.556
THE RESERVOIR SYSTEMS AND AND

00:57:39.622 --> 00:57:40.657
YOU CAN SEE FROM THE SACRAMENTO

00:57:40.723 --> 00:57:42.091
SYSTEM YOU GOT THE OROVILLE DAM

00:57:42.158 --> 00:57:43.026
FOLSOM DAM.

00:57:43.092 --> 00:57:44.227
SHASTA IS OUT OF THE RANGE OF

00:57:44.294 --> 00:57:45.895
THIS GRAPHIC BUT THOSE ARE A

00:57:45.962 --> 00:57:47.197
MAJOR PIECE OF THE FLOOD CONTROL

00:57:47.263 --> 00:57:48.131
PROJECT.

00:57:48.198 --> 00:57:49.599
WHEN MANAGING IT IS A SYSTEM IN

00:57:49.666 --> 00:57:50.834
ON THE SAN JOAQUIN SIDE YOU HAVE

00:57:50.900 --> 00:57:51.334
A NUMBER OF?

00:57:51.401 --> 00:57:53.369
RESERVOIRS -- ON THE ON THE

00:57:53.436 --> 00:57:55.738
MCCALL ONLY CALAVERAS STANISLAUS

00:57:55.805 --> 00:57:57.874
WOLLEMI MERCED RIVER'S AS WELL

00:57:57.941 --> 00:57:58.508
THE CHURCHILL AND FRESNO RIVER

00:57:58.575 --> 00:58:00.009
AND THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER AND

00:58:00.076 --> 00:58:00.877
THE KINGS RIVER.

00:58:00.944 --> 00:58:02.545
THERE'S A LOT OF RESERVOIRS THAT

00:58:02.612 --> 00:58:05.849
ARE MANAGING FLOOD WATERS -- IN

00:58:05.915 --> 00:58:07.917
BOTH OF THOSE SYSTEMS.

00:58:07.984 --> 00:58:08.718
ANOTHER DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE

00:58:08.785 --> 00:58:10.053
TWO SYSTEMS IS A SACRAMENTO

00:58:10.119 --> 00:58:11.321
SYSTEM HAS MORE GREAT CHANGED

00:58:11.387 --> 00:58:14.791
STEEPER SLOPES MOVE WATER FASTER.

00:58:14.858 --> 00:58:15.425
THE SAME WORKING SYSTEM IS MUCH

00:58:15.491 --> 00:58:15.859
FLATTER.

00:58:15.925 --> 00:58:17.160
THAT CREATES A DIFFERENCE IN HOW

00:58:17.227 --> 00:58:18.661
YOU HOW YOU APPROACH THE THE

00:58:18.728 --> 00:58:20.263
CHALLENGE OF FLOOD CONTROL AND

00:58:20.330 --> 00:58:21.931
IN THE SACRAMENTO.

00:58:21.998 --> 00:58:23.600
SILICON VALLEY IS.

00:58:23.666 --> 00:58:26.369
AND IN ADDITION -- IN ADDITION

00:58:26.436 --> 00:58:28.638
OF THOSE PIECES WE HAVE OF

00:58:28.705 --> 00:58:29.272
SIXTEEN HUNDRED MILES OF FEDERAL

00:58:29.339 --> 00:58:30.306
STATE LEVEES.

00:58:30.373 --> 00:58:31.140
IT WAS DEVELOPED IN THE NINETEEN

00:58:31.207 --> 00:58:32.675
FIFTIES WHEN IT WAS ESTABLISHED

00:58:32.742 --> 00:58:34.310
AS A STATE PLAN A FLOOD CONTROL

00:58:34.377 --> 00:58:35.278
IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY.

00:58:35.345 --> 00:58:35.845
IT'S OWNED BY THE STATE OF

00:58:35.912 --> 00:58:37.614
CALIFORNIA AND OPERATED TO

00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:39.082
MAINTAIN MOSTLY BY LOCAL

00:58:39.148 --> 00:58:39.949
AGENCIES.

00:58:40.016 --> 00:58:41.084
AND THE STANDARD FOR MINUTES IS

00:58:41.150 --> 00:58:42.252
REGULATED BY THE ARMY CORPS OF

00:58:42.318 --> 00:58:45.154
ENGINEERS IN THE CENTRE LIKE

00:58:45.221 --> 00:58:46.322
FLOOD PROTECTION BOARD.

00:58:46.389 --> 00:58:47.857
ANOTHER PIECE OF THIS SYSTEM ARE

00:58:47.924 --> 00:58:49.759
THE WEIRS AND BY PASSES.

00:58:49.826 --> 00:58:51.628
WHICH ARE UP MOSTLY MAINTAINED

00:58:51.694 --> 00:58:52.695
BY THE STATE.

00:58:52.762 --> 00:58:54.163
AND AND THE SACRAMENTO SYSTEM

00:58:54.230 --> 00:58:55.665
80% OF THE FLOOD FLOWS ARE

00:58:55.732 --> 00:58:57.267
PASSED THROUGH THE SET THROUGH

00:58:57.333 --> 00:59:00.036
THE THROUGH THE BY PASS SYSTEM

00:59:00.103 --> 00:59:00.970
SHOWN IN GREEN.

00:59:01.037 --> 00:59:04.173
ON ON YOUR ON YOUR HAND OUT.

00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:05.174
IT'S NOT AS PREVALENT OF A BY

00:59:05.241 --> 00:59:06.309
PASS SYSTEM ON THE SAN JOAQUIN

00:59:06.376 --> 00:59:07.944
SYSTEM THERE'S A SMALL BY PASSES

00:59:08.011 --> 00:59:09.579
OFF THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER THAT

00:59:09.646 --> 00:59:11.047
CHURCHILL AND YOU SIDE BY PASS.

00:59:11.114 --> 00:59:12.448
AND THEN FURTHER ON TOWARDS

00:59:12.515 --> 00:59:14.784
TRACY YOU HAVE THE PESCADERO CUT

00:59:14.851 --> 00:59:16.452
WHICH ASK ACTS AS A BY PASS.

00:59:16.519 --> 00:59:17.754
SAID INFLOWS WEST THE WEST HILLS

00:59:17.820 --> 00:59:20.356
AS OPPOSED UP.

00:59:20.423 --> 00:59:23.126
INTO THE URBAN AREAS OF STOCKTON --

00:59:23.192 --> 00:59:23.760
TOOLS OF THE PHYSICAL ELEMENTS

00:59:23.826 --> 00:59:24.427
OF THE FLOOD CONTROL SYSTEM THAT

00:59:24.494 --> 00:59:25.662
I WANT.

00:59:25.728 --> 00:59:26.763
TO MAKE YOU AWARE OF BUT THERE'S

00:59:26.829 --> 00:59:28.131
ALSO IS MICHAEL TO THE NON

00:59:28.197 --> 00:59:30.066
STRUCTURAL PIECES TO THE SYSTEM

00:59:30.133 --> 00:59:31.200
WHICH IS COMPRISED OF THE PEOPLE

00:59:31.267 --> 00:59:33.102
IN THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT MANAGE

00:59:33.169 --> 00:59:33.970
THE SYSTEM.

00:59:34.037 --> 00:59:35.438
THE PUBLIC ENTITIES.

00:59:35.505 --> 00:59:36.306
THEY OPERATE MAINTAIN THE

00:59:36.372 --> 00:59:39.075
PHYSICAL SYSTEM AND YOU.

00:59:39.142 --> 00:59:40.610
YOU'LL YOU'LL HEAR FROM PANELIST

00:59:40.677 --> 00:59:41.511
REPRESENTING THOSE ENTITIES

00:59:41.577 --> 00:59:43.146
TODAY OTHERS ALSO THE GAUGE

00:59:43.212 --> 00:59:45.481
NETWORK AND YOU AND IN THE END

00:59:45.548 --> 00:59:46.983
NOW ALSO STAYED BEHIND THE

00:59:47.050 --> 00:59:48.184
MANAGEMENT THIS THE SYSTEM AND

00:59:48.251 --> 00:59:50.119
IT'S IT'S ROBUST ENCOMPASSES THE

00:59:50.186 --> 00:59:51.154
ENTIRE.

00:59:51.220 --> 00:59:53.456
QUITE A BIT OF A WATERSHED --

00:59:53.523 --> 00:59:55.491
AND THAT'S LARGELY HOW ARE

00:59:55.558 --> 00:59:57.226
FORECAST AND ARE STILL NOT

00:59:57.293 --> 00:59:58.394
FORECASTER.

00:59:58.461 --> 01:00:01.531
ARE A ARE CREATED USING THE GAVE

01:00:01.597 --> 01:00:14.944
SYSTEM.

01:00:15.011 --> 01:00:16.012
SO WE'RE GONNA JUMP THROUGH HAND

01:00:16.079 --> 01:00:17.380
OUT THREE AND THEN -- SHORTLY

01:00:17.447 --> 01:00:19.182
AND A HAND OUT FOR HERE -- WHAT

01:00:19.248 --> 01:00:20.116
YOU'RE LOOKING AT IN THIS

01:00:20.183 --> 01:00:22.352
GRAPHIC ON HAND OUT THREE IT'S

01:00:22.418 --> 01:00:24.120
JUST REVISED CONTACTS THAT AS

01:00:24.187 --> 01:00:25.088
WERE MANAGING THE FLOOD ISKS

01:00:25.154 --> 01:00:26.456
OUT HERE THERE HAVE BEEN A

01:00:26.522 --> 01:00:27.357
HUNDRED YEARS OF OUR BUS

01:00:27.423 --> 01:00:29.826
PLANNING EFFORTS -- THIS GRAPHIC

01:00:29.892 --> 01:00:31.494
HERE TO PICKS WITH DOTS ALL OF

01:00:31.561 --> 01:00:32.829
THE MAJOR FLOODS AT THE CENTRAL

01:00:32.895 --> 01:00:34.364
VALLEY IS EXPERIENCED IN THE

01:00:34.430 --> 01:00:36.132
PAST HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS.

01:00:36.199 --> 01:00:37.700
AND THEN ALL OF THE DOCUMENTS

01:00:37.767 --> 01:00:38.601
YOU'RE SEEING OFF THE SIDE OR

01:00:38.668 --> 01:00:40.903
EITHER PROJECTS OR SOME SORT OF

01:00:40.970 --> 01:00:42.205
FEASIBILITY STUDY OR A PLAN THAT

01:00:42.271 --> 01:00:43.639
HAS BEEN CLEVERLY WORK BETWEEN

01:00:43.706 --> 01:00:46.109
THE STATE -- FEDERAL AGENCIES

01:00:46.175 --> 01:00:47.844
AND LOCAL AGENCIES -- A FEW

01:00:47.910 --> 01:00:49.278
FLOOD EVENTS IN THOSE DOTS THAT

01:00:49.345 --> 01:00:50.380
HE JUST WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT THAT

01:00:50.446 --> 01:00:51.547
ARE VERY FOUNDATIONAL TO

01:00:51.614 --> 01:00:53.082
UNDERSTANDING THE SYSTEM.

01:00:53.149 --> 01:00:54.884
IS IN NINETEEN OH SEVEN NINETEEN

01:00:54.951 --> 01:00:55.985
OH NINE FLOOD EVENTS -- THAT'S

01:00:56.052 --> 01:00:56.919
WHAT MOST OF THE CURRENT

01:00:56.986 --> 01:00:58.021
INFRASTRUCTURE TODAY WAS

01:00:58.087 --> 01:01:00.423
ORIGINALLY SIZED FOR THE

01:01:00.490 --> 01:01:01.057
NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE FLOOD EVENT

01:01:01.124 --> 01:01:02.392
WAS VERY NOTABLE THAT WAS PART

01:01:02.458 --> 01:01:03.760
OF THE JUSTIFICATION FOR

01:01:03.826 --> 01:01:05.428
CREATION OF ORAL DAM.

01:01:05.495 --> 01:01:06.195
WHICH MOST PEOPLE THINK OF AS

01:01:06.262 --> 01:01:07.363
PART OF STATE WATER PROJECT BUT

01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:09.298
IS A CRITICAL FACILITY IN THE

01:01:09.365 --> 01:01:09.966
STATE PLAN A FLOOD CONTROL

01:01:10.033 --> 01:01:10.733
FACILITY.

01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:12.201
AND PROVIDES FLOOD PROTECTION

01:01:12.268 --> 01:01:13.536
FOR THE FEATHER AND SEPARATE

01:01:13.603 --> 01:01:14.771
LOWER SACRAMENTO VALLEY'S.

01:01:14.837 --> 01:01:16.339
AND THEN -- THE LAST OF THE

01:01:16.406 --> 01:01:19.008
MAJOR FLOOD EVENTS WAS THE

01:01:19.075 --> 01:01:19.642
NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX FLOOD EVENT

01:01:19.709 --> 01:01:20.777
WHICH REYES REFERRED TO DURING

01:01:20.843 --> 01:01:22.745
HER PRESENTATION AND THE CONTEXT

01:01:22.812 --> 01:01:24.414
THAT THAT LED TO THE CREATION OF

01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:26.182
THE LEGISLATION.

01:01:26.249 --> 01:01:31.187
TO HAVE A SYSTEM MY PLAN THE

01:01:31.254 --> 01:01:32.288
SENATE BY FOR PROTECTION PLAN.

01:01:32.355 --> 01:01:32.955
AND JOHN'S GOING TO PULL UP THE

01:01:33.022 --> 01:01:34.390
SECOND SLIDE NOW WHICH IS -- A

01:01:34.457 --> 01:01:35.958
MAP JUST IN IS INDICATING AND

01:01:36.025 --> 01:01:38.127
THE SPATIAL EXTENT OF WHERE THE

01:01:38.194 --> 01:01:39.595
STATE IN THE PAST TEN YEARS HAS

01:01:39.662 --> 01:01:42.331
BOUGHT DOWN RISK THROUGH BOTH --

01:01:42.398 --> 01:01:43.666
STRUCTURAL IN NONSTRUCTURAL

01:01:43.733 --> 01:01:45.935
MANAGEMENT ACTIONS AND YOU CAN

01:01:46.002 --> 01:01:46.536
SEE THAT THERE'S BEEN A HIGH

01:01:46.602 --> 01:01:48.671
CONCENTRATION OF INVESTMENTS

01:01:48.738 --> 01:01:50.406
MADE WITHIN THE CENTRAL VALLEY.

01:01:50.473 --> 01:01:51.407
NOW PART OF THAT WAS DUE TO

01:01:51.474 --> 01:01:53.876
PROPOSITION ONE EIGHTEEN EIGHTY

01:01:53.943 --> 01:01:56.045
FOUR WHEN THEY WERE ADOPTED IN

01:01:56.112 --> 01:01:56.813
TWO THOUSAND SIX THERE WAS

01:01:56.879 --> 01:01:57.547
NEARLY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS

01:01:57.613 --> 01:01:59.482
THEIR PORTIONS OF THAT MONEY WAS

01:01:59.549 --> 01:02:00.850
SET ASIDE FOR THE CENTRAL VALLEY.

01:02:00.917 --> 01:02:02.118
WITH THE REMAINING PORTIONS THAT

01:02:02.185 --> 01:02:03.486
MONEY WAS TO BE DISTRIBUTED

01:02:03.553 --> 01:02:05.488
STATEWIDE -- BUT THIS GIVES YOU

01:02:05.555 --> 01:02:07.056
AN INDICATION THE TYPES OF

01:02:07.123 --> 01:02:07.824
PROJECTS THAT THOSE DOTS

01:02:07.890 --> 01:02:10.393
REPRESENT ALL REPRESENT SORT OF

01:02:10.460 --> 01:02:11.661
A BLEND OF WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IN

01:02:11.727 --> 01:02:14.163
THE STAIR STEP GRAPHIC OFF TO

01:02:14.230 --> 01:02:17.767
THE RIGHT HERE -- WITH THAT THE

01:02:17.834 --> 01:02:19.702
APPROACH BY WHICH WE WERE GOING

01:02:19.769 --> 01:02:20.636
THROUGH AND I WANT TO GIVE YOU A

01:02:20.703 --> 01:02:22.371
LITTLE MORE DETAIL OF ADDRESSING

01:02:22.438 --> 01:02:24.207
CLIMATE CHANGE RISKS IN THE

01:02:24.273 --> 01:02:25.541
CENTRAL VALLEY WITH THOSE

01:02:25.608 --> 01:02:26.843
PROJECTS ACTUALLY LOOK LIKE.

01:02:26.909 --> 01:02:29.345
CAN BE SEEN NOW IN HAND OUT FIVE

01:02:29.412 --> 01:02:30.513
IN IN THIS PARTICULAR GRAPHIC

01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:31.814
OFF TO THE LEFT YOU'RE LOOKING

01:02:31.881 --> 01:02:34.016
OUT THE LOWER THE A BY PASS OF

01:02:34.083 --> 01:02:35.952
THE A BY PASS IS ONE OF THAT

01:02:36.018 --> 01:02:38.020
SYSTEM A BY PASS IS FOR THE

01:02:38.087 --> 01:02:39.122
SACRAMENTO RIVER.

01:02:39.188 --> 01:02:40.857
AND WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT THERE

01:02:40.923 --> 01:02:42.458
IN THE BLUE IS YOUR BY ASSETS

01:02:42.525 --> 01:02:43.526
THIRTY FIVE MILES LONG THE

01:02:43.593 --> 01:02:45.328
SACRAMENTO RIVER STARTS OFF TO

01:02:45.394 --> 01:02:47.230
THE WEST OF THEIR CUTS ACROSS

01:02:47.296 --> 01:02:48.631
THE TOP OF THE A BY PASS.

01:02:48.698 --> 01:02:50.766
AND THEN PASSES ESSENTIALLY TO

01:02:50.833 --> 01:02:53.970
THE EAST OF THE A BYPASS -- AND

01:02:54.036 --> 01:02:55.571
TOGETHER THEY WORK AS A SYSTEM

01:02:55.638 --> 01:02:57.874
DURING FLOOD EVENTS ABOUT 80% OF

01:02:57.940 --> 01:02:59.575
THE FLOOD WATERS ACTUALLY MOVED

01:02:59.642 --> 01:03:01.043
THROUGH THE YELLOW BYPASS THEIR

01:03:01.110 --> 01:03:02.545
EFFECTIVELY PROTECTING.

01:03:02.612 --> 01:03:04.714
THE GREATER SACRAMENTO WEST

01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:06.349
SACRAMENTO METROPOLITAN AREA --

01:03:06.415 --> 01:03:08.317
BUT THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT

01:03:08.384 --> 01:03:09.719
THE BY PASSES WHEN IT'S NOT

01:03:09.785 --> 01:03:11.854
BEING USED FOR FLOOD PROTECTION

01:03:11.921 --> 01:03:13.189
IT IS AN IMPORTANT AREA OF

01:03:13.256 --> 01:03:15.024
AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION FOR YOLO

01:03:15.091 --> 01:03:16.259
SOLANO COUNTY.

01:03:16.325 --> 01:03:17.693
AS WELL AS AN AREA WHERE WE

01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:20.463
CURRENTLY HAVE A VERY ROBUST --

01:03:20.530 --> 01:03:22.765
AB IN A WATERFALL AND AQUATIC

01:03:22.832 --> 01:03:24.200
SPECIES AN IMPORTANT FOOD SOURCE

01:03:24.267 --> 01:03:26.002
SO THIS IS BECOME A FLAGSHIP FOR

01:03:26.068 --> 01:03:27.270
WILL BE CALL INTEGRATED WATER

01:03:27.336 --> 01:03:28.538
MANAGEMENT OR MULTI BENEFIT

01:03:28.604 --> 01:03:29.739
PROJECTS.

01:03:29.805 --> 01:03:31.507
IN THE MAP ALL THE LITTLE WHITE

01:03:31.574 --> 01:03:32.842
COLLAR BOXES YOU'RE LOOKING AT

01:03:32.909 --> 01:03:35.011
OUR INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS THAT THE

01:03:35.077 --> 01:03:36.345
DEPARTMENT WITH THE ARMY CORPS

01:03:36.412 --> 01:03:38.514
OF ENGINEERS AND LOCAL AGENCIES

01:03:38.581 --> 01:03:40.449
BUT THE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND

01:03:40.516 --> 01:03:41.584
THE LOCAL MEANT LEVY MAINTAINING

01:03:41.651 --> 01:03:42.952
AGENCIES AND LAND OWNERS.

01:03:43.019 --> 01:03:44.253
HAVE COLLECTIVELY WORKED ON AN

01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:50.560
ARTICULATED WITHIN THE CONTEXT

01:03:50.626 --> 01:03:51.127
OF CENTER I FLOOD PROTECTION

01:03:51.194 --> 01:03:52.328
PLAN.

01:03:52.395 --> 01:03:53.329
NOW JUMPING DOWN INTO THE

01:03:53.396 --> 01:03:53.863
SOUTHERN PART OF THE DELTA

01:03:53.930 --> 01:03:54.664
THERE'S A CONCEPTUAL GRAPHIC

01:03:54.730 --> 01:03:56.232
HERE FOR PARADISE CUT EXPANSION --

01:03:56.299 --> 01:03:57.833
VERY SIMILAR TO THE A BY PASS

01:03:57.900 --> 01:04:00.036
AGAIN THIS IS A STRUCTURE WHERE

01:04:00.102 --> 01:04:01.404
WE'RE GOING TO IMPROVE THE

01:04:01.470 --> 01:04:03.306
CONVEYANCE OF WATER THE WATER

01:04:03.372 --> 01:04:05.608
WILL NOT GO DOWN AS SEMI CAN

01:04:05.675 --> 01:04:06.909
RIVER AND CAN ENTER INTO THE OLD

01:04:06.976 --> 01:04:09.478
AND MIDDLE RIVERS -- THE SIZING

01:04:09.545 --> 01:04:11.080
OF WHAT YOU'RE SEEING HERE FOR

01:04:11.147 --> 01:04:12.982
THE PARADISE CUT WAS ACTUALLY

01:04:13.049 --> 01:04:14.550
CONDITIONED ON FUTURE CLIMATE

01:04:14.617 --> 01:04:16.319
CHANGE CONDITIONS SO WE'RE

01:04:16.385 --> 01:04:17.687
ACTUALLY GETTING WHAT IS

01:04:17.753 --> 01:04:20.122
EQUIVALENT TO A VERY LARGE DROP

01:04:20.189 --> 01:04:21.657
IN THE THE FLOODWATERS PASSING

01:04:21.724 --> 01:04:23.659
THROUGH STOCKTON MANTECA.

01:04:23.726 --> 01:04:24.460
AND A LINE THAT WATER TO MOVE

01:04:24.527 --> 01:04:26.429
THROUGH THE DELTA WELL ACHIEVING

01:04:26.495 --> 01:04:45.081
HABITAT OPPORTUNITIES AS WELL

01:04:46.749 --> 01:04:46.816
.

01:04:46.816 --> 01:04:47.683
THE MOST COLORFUL GRAPHICS.

01:04:47.750 --> 01:04:49.185
ARE THE MOST COLORFUL GRAPHIC OF

01:04:49.252 --> 01:04:51.020
THE OF THE DAY IS IT SHOWS HOW

01:04:51.087 --> 01:04:52.321
WEGOT TO WHERE WE ARE THIS

01:04:52.388 --> 01:04:52.555
WINTER.

01:04:52.622 --> 01:04:55.124
THIS IS A APART PUT TOGETHER BY

01:04:55.191 --> 01:04:57.026
CW THREE YOU PICK THE THE CENTER

01:04:57.093 --> 01:04:58.794
FOR WESTERN WEATHER AND WATER

01:04:58.861 --> 01:05:00.263
EXTREMES.

01:05:00.329 --> 01:05:01.297
AND AND AND THE BEAT BUT WE'VE

01:05:01.364 --> 01:05:03.799
BEEN WORKING WITH THEM TO HELP

01:05:03.866 --> 01:05:04.967
DEVELOP A BETTER UNDERSTANDING

01:05:05.034 --> 01:05:05.468
OF THE ATMOSPHERIC RIVER

01:05:05.534 --> 01:05:06.502
PROCESSES.

01:05:06.569 --> 01:05:09.205
AND AND FORECASTING AND TO BUILD

01:05:09.272 --> 01:05:10.506
AWARENESS BECAUSE THIS HELPS US

01:05:10.573 --> 01:05:11.941
MANAGE FLOOD WATERS AS WELL AS

01:05:12.008 --> 01:05:16.279
MANAGE -- MANAGE WATER SUPPLY.

01:05:16.345 --> 01:05:17.246
AND SO.

01:05:17.313 --> 01:05:18.648
THIS IS WHY WE HAVE SUCH A WET

01:05:18.714 --> 01:05:19.615
WINTER FORTY SEVEN OCCURS

01:05:19.682 --> 01:05:21.183
ATMOSPHERIC RIVERS MADE LANDFALL

01:05:21.250 --> 01:05:23.486
ON THOUGH -- CONNELL US HALF OF

01:05:23.552 --> 01:05:24.754
THOSE.

01:05:24.820 --> 01:05:25.588
MADE LANDFALL IN THE STATE IT ON

01:05:25.655 --> 01:05:27.189
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHICH IS

01:05:27.256 --> 01:05:30.860
WHY WE HAVE ABOUT A 126% OF OUR

01:05:30.926 --> 01:05:32.428
STATEWIDE AVERAGE THIS YEAR.

01:05:32.495 --> 01:05:33.996
AND JUST.

01:05:34.063 --> 01:05:35.531
THE IN GAME THE IMPORTANCE OF OF

01:05:35.598 --> 01:05:36.999
WORKING WITH THESE PARTNERS IS

01:05:37.066 --> 01:05:38.134
THAT AN IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING

01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:39.568
OF THE ATMOSPHERIC RIVER

01:05:39.635 --> 01:05:40.036
PROCESSES REDUCES THE

01:05:40.102 --> 01:05:41.537
UNCERTAINTY.

01:05:41.604 --> 01:05:42.038
IMPROVES OUR ABILITY TO

01:05:42.104 --> 01:05:44.440
COMMUNICATE REAL TIME FLOOD RISK

01:05:44.507 --> 01:05:45.908
ENABLES LOCAL WATER AGENCIES TO

01:05:45.975 --> 01:05:48.277
BETTER MEET THEIR MULTIPLE WATER

01:05:48.344 --> 01:05:50.613
MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES.

01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:51.781
THE NEXT GRAPHIC WE HAVE UP AS

01:05:51.847 --> 01:05:52.882
ANOTHER STEP SORT OF WHERE WE'RE

01:05:52.948 --> 01:05:56.218
AT THE PRESENT SITUATION -- YOUR

01:05:56.285 --> 01:05:57.486
MATE BEGINNING IN MAY HERE AND

01:05:57.553 --> 01:05:59.055
SO THIS IS A THIS IS A FIGURE

01:05:59.121 --> 01:06:00.423
WITH DATA THAT COMES FROM OUR A

01:06:00.489 --> 01:06:01.924
CALIFORNIA DID EXCHANGE CENTER

01:06:01.991 --> 01:06:04.026
AS WELL WHICH IS FED BY THE THE

01:06:04.093 --> 01:06:05.361
RESERVOIR OPERATORS AS WELL AS

01:06:05.428 --> 01:06:06.696
THAT STATEWIDE MONITORING

01:06:06.762 --> 01:06:08.331
NETWORK OF GAUGES.

01:06:08.397 --> 01:06:11.367
THAT I TOUCHED ON EARLIER AND AS

01:06:11.434 --> 01:06:13.369
YOU CAN SEE YEAH THE BLUE BAR

01:06:13.436 --> 01:06:13.869
SHOW THE STATUS OF THE

01:06:13.936 --> 01:06:16.505
RESERVOIRS.

01:06:16.572 --> 01:06:17.139
THAT'S A PRETTY FULL RESERVOIRS

01:06:17.206 --> 01:06:18.407
AT THIS MOMENT.

01:06:18.474 --> 01:06:19.742
NEARING THE TOP CONSERVATION

01:06:19.809 --> 01:06:21.711
WHICH IS THAT RED LINE WHICH IS

01:06:21.777 --> 01:06:23.312
ANYTHING ABOVE THAT IS SPACE OF

01:06:23.379 --> 01:06:24.280
THE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS

01:06:24.347 --> 01:06:26.449
REGULATES AND WANTS TO KEEP OPEN.

01:06:26.515 --> 01:06:28.017
IN CASE THERE'S A THERE'S AN

01:06:28.084 --> 01:06:28.818
INFLUX OF INFLOWS IN THAT

01:06:28.884 --> 01:06:30.252
RESERVOIR FOR THE PROTECTION OF

01:06:30.319 --> 01:06:31.420
THE RESERVOIR AND FOR THE

01:06:31.487 --> 01:06:33.255
PROTECTION OF THE THE DOWNSTREAM

01:06:33.322 --> 01:06:34.290
COMMUNITIES.

01:06:34.357 --> 01:06:35.791
HELLO BAR ON THE RIGHT.

01:06:35.858 --> 01:06:37.793
WITH THE KIND OF SNOW OUTLINES

01:06:37.860 --> 01:06:41.697
THAT'S THE FORECASTED -- SNOW

01:06:41.764 --> 01:06:43.833
MELT IT REMAINS TO BE THE BEST

01:06:43.899 --> 01:06:46.202
IS YET TO RUN OFF OUT OF THE OUT

01:06:46.268 --> 01:06:46.836
OF THE WATER SHOULD ABOVE THOSE

01:06:46.902 --> 01:06:48.804
RESERVOIRS.

01:06:48.871 --> 01:06:50.239
AND THAT'S THAT'S DATA THAT'S

01:06:50.306 --> 01:06:51.574
COMES FROM ARSENAL CENTER

01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:53.075
NETWORK AS WELL AS OUR MANUAL

01:06:53.142 --> 01:06:55.845
SNOW -- ARSENAL MEASUREMENTS.

01:06:55.911 --> 01:06:57.446
AND SO THAT YOU CAN SEE THE THE

01:06:57.513 --> 01:06:58.547
THE WET WEATHER WE GOTFULL

01:06:58.614 --> 01:07:00.282
RESERVOIRS AND IT'S ALSO BEEN A

01:07:00.349 --> 01:07:00.883
COLD WINTER WHICH MEANS WE'VE

01:07:00.950 --> 01:07:02.885
GOT A WHICH IS WHY WE HAVE A

01:07:02.952 --> 01:07:04.186
DEEP SNOW PACK.

01:07:04.253 --> 01:07:06.322
AND WE PEAKED IN AT FORTY FIVE

01:07:06.389 --> 01:07:07.356
INCHES OF STATEWIDE SNOW WATER

01:07:07.423 --> 01:07:08.791
EQUIVALENT ON MARCH THIRTY FIRST

01:07:08.858 --> 01:07:11.127
AND ALREADY WE'VE LOST ABOUT

01:07:11.193 --> 01:07:11.494
TWENTY INCHES.

01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:13.562
OF THAT OF THAT FORTY FIVE

01:07:13.629 --> 01:07:15.197
INCHES JUST IN THE STOMACH THAT

01:07:15.264 --> 01:07:18.634
OCCURRED IN APRIL.

01:07:18.701 --> 01:07:21.337
QUESTION SO THE STATE.

01:07:21.404 --> 01:07:22.905
DOESN'T OPERATE OWNER OPERATOR

01:07:22.972 --> 01:07:23.205
[inaudible]

01:07:23.272 --> 01:07:24.006
YEAH CERTAINLY. TO ASK A

01:07:24.073 --> 01:07:26.642
QUESTION [inaudible]

01:07:26.709 --> 01:07:33.849
THE NORMAL CHARGE EVER

01:07:33.916 --> 01:07:36.185
PERCENTAGE FIGURE. 10% 50% 90%

01:07:36.252 --> 01:07:38.354
IN A NUMBER ASSOCIATED WITH THAT

01:07:38.421 --> 01:07:39.655
WHAT IS THAT NUMBER.

01:07:39.722 --> 01:07:41.524
THAT'S THE UNCERTAINTY.

01:07:41.590 --> 01:07:43.092
THAT WE HAVE IN THE IN THE

01:07:43.159 --> 01:07:43.726
AMOUNT OF SNOW THAT'S GONNA RUN

01:07:43.793 --> 01:07:46.896
OFF -- SO WHAT.

01:07:46.962 --> 01:07:48.397
THAT CAPTURES KIND OF THE MIDDLE

01:07:48.464 --> 01:07:49.799
80%.

01:07:49.865 --> 01:07:51.700
HEY I WHAT FOR EXAMPLE I

01:07:51.767 --> 01:07:53.669
ACTUALLY FOLLOWED MERCED RIVER I

01:07:53.736 --> 01:07:55.070
KNOW WHAT ONE AM THIS MORNING.

01:07:55.137 --> 01:07:56.038
IT.

01:07:56.105 --> 01:07:58.407
IT WAS NINE FEET AS IT EXITS THE

01:07:58.474 --> 01:08:01.277
VALLEY -- JUST LOOK AT THE

01:08:01.343 --> 01:08:03.412
MERCED RIVER BASIN I SEE THE 10%

01:08:03.479 --> 01:08:05.414
THAT'S A PROBABILITY WHAT'S THE

01:08:05.481 --> 01:08:07.183
EIGHT FOURTEEN EZANI.

01:08:07.249 --> 01:08:09.051
ARE YOU TRANSIT IN THE 10% TO

01:08:09.118 --> 01:08:10.252
SOME CUBIC FEET PER SECOND OR

01:08:10.319 --> 01:08:11.720
SOME OTHER NUMBER SO WHAT'S THE

01:08:11.787 --> 01:08:13.422
YES CERTAINLY SO OUR OUR MEDIAN

01:08:13.489 --> 01:08:14.657
FORECAST.

01:08:14.723 --> 01:08:16.358
IS A THERE'S STILL SIX HUNDRED

01:08:16.425 --> 01:08:18.093
AND EIGHTY FOUR THOUSAND ACRE

01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:20.429
FEET OF WATER THAT NEEDS TO RUN

01:08:20.496 --> 01:08:21.096
OFF.

01:08:21.163 --> 01:08:23.199
OUT OF THAT KIND OF THE MERCED

01:08:23.265 --> 01:08:23.866
RIVER BASIN.

01:08:23.933 --> 01:08:25.067
THAT WE THINK THERE'S A 90%

01:08:25.134 --> 01:08:27.436
CHANCE THAT THAT.

01:08:27.503 --> 01:08:29.371
WILL AT LEAST GET FIVE HUNDRED

01:08:29.438 --> 01:08:30.272
FORTY FOUR THOUSAND ACRE FEET.

01:08:30.339 --> 01:08:30.873
AND WE'RE SAYING IT'S LESS

01:08:30.940 --> 01:08:32.274
LIKELY WERE NEVER GOING TO GET

01:08:32.341 --> 01:08:35.077
ANYTHING ABOVE EIGHT HUNDRED

01:08:35.144 --> 01:08:35.978
FOURTEEN THOUSAND ACRE FEET.

01:08:36.045 --> 01:08:38.414
OKAY SO THAT'S THOUSANDS OF ACRE

01:08:38.481 --> 01:08:40.249
FEET I JUST DID YEAH SEE WHERE

01:08:40.316 --> 01:08:42.818
THAT WAS EXPLAINED THANK YOU.

01:08:42.885 --> 01:08:44.854
YEAH.

01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:45.321
YOU FOR THE QUESTION.

01:08:45.387 --> 01:08:50.159
ALLOW ME TO CLARIFY.

01:08:50.226 --> 01:08:51.694
SO THE STATE DOESN'T OWN AND

01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:53.429
OPERATE ALL OF THESE RESERVOIR

01:08:53.496 --> 01:08:54.296
IS THE ONLY ONE THAT IT OUTLINES

01:08:54.363 --> 01:08:57.199
AND OPERATES IS.

01:08:57.266 --> 01:08:58.300
IS LIKE OR DISLIKE ORAL -- THE

01:08:58.367 --> 01:08:59.468
REST ARE OPERATED BY THE BUREAU

01:08:59.535 --> 01:09:01.136
OF RECLAMATION THE ARMY CORPS OF

01:09:01.203 --> 01:09:04.139
ENGINEERS AND SEVERAL LOCAL

01:09:04.206 --> 01:09:06.041
LOCAL WATER DISTRICTS TURLOCK

01:09:06.108 --> 01:09:09.011
IRRIGATION DISTRICT -- ON THE TO

01:09:09.078 --> 01:09:11.480
ONLY RIVER AND THEN WERE SITTER

01:09:11.547 --> 01:09:14.450
ADDITION DISTRICT ON THE ON A ON

01:09:14.517 --> 01:09:16.719
THE ON THE I NEVER SAID RIVER

01:09:16.785 --> 01:09:17.152
BASIN.

01:09:17.219 --> 01:09:18.954
THINKING IS RIVER WATER

01:09:19.021 --> 01:09:19.522
AUTHORITY ON THE KINGS RIVER

01:09:19.588 --> 01:09:20.856
BASIN.

01:09:20.923 --> 01:09:22.491
AND SO WHILE MOVING TO THE NEXT

01:09:22.558 --> 01:09:23.859
GRAPHIC WELL THIS WELL THIS

01:09:23.926 --> 01:09:26.395
LOOKS DAUNTING -- NOW THERE'S

01:09:26.462 --> 01:09:28.497
THERE'S A LOT OF SNOW NOT YET TO

01:09:28.564 --> 01:09:31.133
COME AND THE SAN JOAQUIN READY

01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:32.268
AS YOU SAW ON THE DESCRIPTION OF

01:09:32.334 --> 01:09:33.335
THE STATE PLAN OF THE CONTROL

01:09:33.402 --> 01:09:34.503
THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER SYSTEM AND

01:09:34.570 --> 01:09:35.571
THE AND THE LEVY SYSTEM.

01:09:35.638 --> 01:09:37.072
DOESN'T HAVE NEAR THE CAPACITY

01:09:37.139 --> 01:09:39.775
OF THE SACRAMENTO RIVER SYSTEM

01:09:39.842 --> 01:09:41.677
THESE FLOWS NEED TO BE MANAGED.

01:09:41.744 --> 01:09:42.511
AND THIS MAN IS COOPER RELIEF TO

01:09:42.578 --> 01:09:44.847
OUR FORECAST COURTED OPERATIONS

01:09:44.914 --> 01:09:46.682
GROUP WITHIN WITHIN OUR OFFICE.

01:09:46.749 --> 01:09:48.918
AND WHICH IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT

01:09:48.984 --> 01:09:52.054
AND AND IN THE KNOWING THAT

01:09:52.121 --> 01:09:52.354
[inaudible]

01:09:52.421 --> 01:09:54.723
THAT.

01:09:54.790 --> 01:09:55.858
THE STATE CAN'T FORCE ANYONE

01:09:55.925 --> 01:09:58.027
OPERATE.

01:09:58.093 --> 01:09:59.028
A RESERVOIR THE MAYBE WE WOULD

01:09:59.094 --> 01:10:01.597
LIKE TO REDUCE FLOOD RISKS SO WE

01:10:01.664 --> 01:10:02.965
WERE COOPERATE FULLY WITH THEM.

01:10:03.032 --> 01:10:05.734
TO HELP BY GIVING THEM -- GIVING

01:10:05.801 --> 01:10:06.402
OUT FUNDS TO HAVE BETTER GAUGING

01:10:06.468 --> 01:10:07.503
STICKING OUT BETTER DATA WITHIN

01:10:07.570 --> 01:10:09.471
THE BASINS AND DEVELOPING TOOLS

01:10:09.538 --> 01:10:11.640
LIKE THE ONE THAT YOU SEE ON OUR

01:10:11.707 --> 01:10:14.843
ON OUR ON THE NEXT SLIDE HERE

01:10:14.910 --> 01:10:16.579
THAT'S UP -- TO HELP THEM MANAGE

01:10:16.645 --> 01:10:18.981
AND AND AND WORK THROUGH SOME OF

01:10:19.048 --> 01:10:20.849
THE SCENARIOS THE WORST CASE AND

01:10:20.916 --> 01:10:23.118
BEST CASE SCENARIOS -- ON HOW

01:10:23.185 --> 01:10:24.653
THEY WANT TO MANAGE MANAGE THOSE

01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:26.789
RESERVOIRS.

01:10:26.855 --> 01:10:28.390
AND SO ON THAT ON THE TOP FIGURE

01:10:28.457 --> 01:10:29.558
IT'S COULD YOU THE SNAPSHOT

01:10:29.625 --> 01:10:30.526
THAT'S TO COME THAT'S THE

01:10:30.593 --> 01:10:32.061
PICTURE OF THIS THE THE UPPER

01:10:32.127 --> 01:10:33.996
SAN JOAQUIN SYSTEM -- FROM THE

01:10:34.063 --> 01:10:36.198
KINGS RIVER ALL THE WAY ALL THE

01:10:36.265 --> 01:10:39.168
WAY UP. TO TO GET STANISLAUS

01:10:39.234 --> 01:10:40.669
RIVER BASIN.

01:10:40.736 --> 01:10:41.837
AND AT THE MOMENT EVERYTHING IS

01:10:41.904 --> 01:10:43.472
LOOKING PRETTY GREEN GREENS GOOD --

01:10:43.539 --> 01:10:44.873
THAT YELLOW YOU SEE I DON PAGERS

01:10:44.940 --> 01:10:46.909
ONLY A CALL BECAUSE THE DATA

01:10:46.976 --> 01:10:48.177
THERE IS A DAY OLD.

01:10:48.243 --> 01:10:50.079
AND SO AS WE WANNA MAKE SURE

01:10:50.145 --> 01:10:50.646
WORKING WITH NEW DATA AND

01:10:50.713 --> 01:10:52.781
THAT'LL TURN GREEN WHEN IT'S

01:10:52.848 --> 01:10:53.983
WHEN WE GOT NEW DATE IN THERE.

01:10:54.049 --> 01:10:55.317
AND ON THE BOTTOM SLIDE THE

01:10:55.384 --> 01:10:56.986
BOTTOM OF THAT SLIDE THERE.

01:10:57.052 --> 01:10:59.822
IS IS THE ACTUAL UP.

01:10:59.888 --> 01:11:00.889
PROGRAM THAT WE'VE DEVELOPED AND

01:11:00.956 --> 01:11:02.024
IT'S HOSTED BY OUR CALIFORNIA

01:11:02.091 --> 01:11:03.492
DID EXCHANGE CENTER THAT THE

01:11:03.559 --> 01:11:05.327
RESERVOIR OPERATORS HAVE ACCESS

01:11:05.394 --> 01:11:07.763
TO AND THEY CAN USE. TO TO TEST

01:11:07.830 --> 01:11:09.498
AND SEE HOW THEY'RE DIFFERENT

01:11:09.565 --> 01:11:11.233
RESTAURANT RATIONS MIGHT

01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:13.369
INFLUENCE -- THE FLOOD CONTROL

01:11:13.435 --> 01:11:15.037
SYSTEM DOWNSTREAM AND SO THEY

01:11:15.104 --> 01:11:17.006
CAN PLAY WITH DIFFERENT SOURCES

01:11:17.072 --> 01:11:18.540
OF SNOW MELT DATA THE

01:11:18.607 --> 01:11:20.242
DEPARTMENTS FOR THE CALIFORNIA

01:11:20.309 --> 01:11:21.910
AND RIVER RIVER FORECAST CENTERS.

01:11:21.977 --> 01:11:23.012
THEY CAN ALSO PLAY WITH

01:11:23.078 --> 01:11:27.449
DIFFERENT -- SNOW MELT.

01:11:27.516 --> 01:11:28.317
STILL NOT SHAPES AND EARLY MELT

01:11:28.384 --> 01:11:29.885
MAYBE A LATE MELT SO THAT THEY

01:11:29.952 --> 01:11:31.053
CAN KIND OF PLAY WITH THE TIME

01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:32.021
OF HOW THAT MIGHT COME ALSO THEY

01:11:32.087 --> 01:11:33.889
CAN REALLY TRY TO OPTIMIZE THEIR

01:11:33.956 --> 01:11:35.524
RESERVOIR OPERATION TO MEET THE

01:11:35.591 --> 01:11:37.493
BILL WHAT I BENEFIT NEEDS ONE IS.

01:11:37.559 --> 01:11:38.460
TO CLEARLY THEY WANT TO FILL THE

01:11:38.527 --> 01:11:39.762
RESERVOIR BY THE END OF MONTH

01:11:39.828 --> 01:11:41.230
AND INTO THEY WANT THEY DON'T

01:11:41.296 --> 01:11:43.032
WANT TO DO THAT IN SUCH A WAY

01:11:43.098 --> 01:11:44.299
THAT PUTS THE DOWNSTREAM FLOOD

01:11:44.366 --> 01:11:44.500
CAN.

01:11:44.566 --> 01:11:47.202
FLOOD SYSTEM AT RISK -- AND THAT

01:11:47.269 --> 01:11:49.171
THEY GET TO FALL TO EARLY AND

01:11:49.238 --> 01:11:50.372
THEN.

01:11:50.439 --> 01:11:51.674
WE GET A SURPRISE IN THE SNOW

01:11:51.740 --> 01:11:53.142
MELT AND THEY HAVE TO YOU KNOW

01:11:53.208 --> 01:11:55.177
MAYBE THEY STILL HAVE NO CONTROL

01:11:55.244 --> 01:11:55.611
RELEASE.

01:11:55.678 --> 01:11:57.579
SO THIS THIS FLOOD CONTROL

01:11:57.646 --> 01:11:58.947
FORECAST COURTING OPERATIONS

01:11:59.014 --> 01:12:00.683
EFFORT -- IS GOING ON ITS

01:12:00.749 --> 01:12:03.385
ELEVENTH ALMOST TWELVE YEAR NOW --

01:12:03.452 --> 01:12:04.553
WE GOT THE SUPPORT OF THE ARMY

01:12:04.620 --> 01:12:06.188
CORPS OF ENGINEERS WHO WORK WITH

01:12:06.255 --> 01:12:07.056
THE SYSTEM AS WELL THE

01:12:07.122 --> 01:12:08.357
CALIFORNIA AND RIVER FORECAST

01:12:08.424 --> 01:12:09.558
CENTER AND THE RESERVOIR

01:12:09.625 --> 01:12:11.160
OPERATORS THEMSELVES YOU. TO

01:12:11.226 --> 01:12:14.263
WORK PROPERLY TO TO MANAGE AND

01:12:14.329 --> 01:12:15.731
AND SO EVERYONE CAN ALL TAKE

01:12:15.798 --> 01:12:21.003
THEIR TURN IN RELEASING WATER

01:12:21.070 --> 01:12:21.804
INTO THE SAN JOAQUIN SYSTEM

01:12:21.870 --> 01:12:22.104
[inaudible]

01:12:22.171 --> 01:12:22.838
AND THEN.

01:12:22.905 --> 01:12:23.906
WHAT WE'RE ABLE TO DO IS?

01:12:23.972 --> 01:12:25.674
AS WE WORK WITH THEM ON ON THE

01:12:25.741 --> 01:12:27.776
RESERVOIR OPERATIONS WE CAN

01:12:27.843 --> 01:12:30.145
COMMUNICATE THAT INFORMATION.

01:12:30.212 --> 01:12:31.246
THE DASHING FLOOD MANAGERS THE

01:12:31.313 --> 01:12:33.348
COUNTY EMERGENCY MANAGERS THE

01:12:33.415 --> 01:12:34.683
LOCAL LEVY MAINTAINING AGENCIES

01:12:34.750 --> 01:12:37.753
SO EVERYONE'S AWARE OF OF WHAT

01:12:37.820 --> 01:12:39.621
RESERVOIR MIGHT BE AT RISK OF

01:12:39.688 --> 01:12:41.090
SPELLING OR HAVING A HAVING A

01:12:41.156 --> 01:12:42.958
RELEASE THAT COULD CHALLENGE THE

01:12:43.025 --> 01:12:43.559
CAPACITY OF THE FLOOD CONTROL

01:12:43.625 --> 01:12:44.560
SYSTEM.

01:12:44.626 --> 01:12:45.561
AND AND WITH THAT AWARENESS

01:12:45.627 --> 01:12:46.562
WEAKENED THE STATE CAN PRE

01:12:46.628 --> 01:12:49.665
POSITIONED RESOURCES AND PEOPLE --

01:12:49.732 --> 01:12:52.434
IN ANTICIPATION OF THOSE.

01:12:52.501 --> 01:12:53.502
OF A POTENTIAL FLOOD RELEASES.

01:12:53.569 --> 01:12:55.471
BUT AT THE MOMENT.

01:12:55.537 --> 01:13:02.244
IT'S LOOKING PRETTY GOOD.

01:13:02.311 --> 01:13:04.146
SO IN CONCLUSION -- NEAR TERM

01:13:04.213 --> 01:13:05.647
WILL CONTINUE TO FORECAST WILL

01:13:05.714 --> 01:13:07.883
CONTINUE TO VERIFY -- OUR DATA

01:13:07.950 --> 01:13:09.518
AND AND RECALIBRATE THE MODELS

01:13:09.585 --> 01:13:11.620
AND THIS IS UPDATED DAILY ON A

01:13:11.687 --> 01:13:12.855
REAL TIME BASIS WITH THE

01:13:12.921 --> 01:13:13.956
RESERVOIR OPERATORS.

01:13:14.022 --> 01:13:15.724
A WILL CONTINUE.

01:13:15.791 --> 01:13:16.859
TO WORK WITH THROUGH THE

01:13:16.925 --> 01:13:17.960
FORECASTED COURTED OPERATIONS

01:13:18.026 --> 01:13:19.528
PROGRAM AND COMMUNICATE

01:13:19.595 --> 01:13:20.796
INFORMATION TO THE DOWNSTREAM

01:13:20.863 --> 01:13:21.997
FLOOD MANAGERS.

01:13:22.064 --> 01:13:23.465
AND WILL CONTINUE.

01:13:23.532 --> 01:13:24.933
TO LOOK FOR NEEDS TO PRE

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.335
POSITION MATERIALS AND AND

01:13:26.401 --> 01:13:30.072
PEOPLE AN ANTICIPATION OF A OF A

01:13:30.139 --> 01:13:30.639
HIGH WATER EVENT ON THE SAN

01:13:30.706 --> 01:13:33.208
JOAQUIN SYSTEM [inaudible]

01:13:33.275 --> 01:13:34.743
WE'RE DONE [inaudible]

01:13:34.810 --> 01:13:37.913
THANK YOU [inaudible] FOR THE

01:13:37.980 --> 01:13:39.548
ACTUAL PRESENTATIONS AND

01:13:39.615 --> 01:13:41.416
CERTAINLY BRIDGE TOPIC AT THIS

01:13:41.483 --> 01:13:42.184
TIME WILL BRING ABOUT THE

01:13:42.251 --> 01:13:44.419
NUMBERS I SEE THE MYSTICAL YES

01:13:44.486 --> 01:13:45.921
QUESTION.

01:13:45.988 --> 01:13:46.955
AND I WAS SORT OF MULTI TASKING

01:13:47.022 --> 01:13:49.091
SO SHAME ON ME.

01:13:49.158 --> 01:13:51.894
BUT DO YOU END UP HAVING A IS

01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:53.395
THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER SYSTEM

01:13:53.462 --> 01:13:55.030
REQUIRE GREATER COORDINATION

01:13:55.097 --> 01:13:58.801
AMONG SORT OF PARTNER AGENCIES.

01:13:58.867 --> 01:14:00.402
MY SENSE IS THE SACK ROSE MORE

01:14:00.469 --> 01:14:02.805
STATE BROWN.

01:14:02.871 --> 01:14:04.039
THAT THAT THE BIG RELEASES ARE

01:14:04.106 --> 01:14:05.607
ARE.

01:14:05.674 --> 01:14:07.476
MADE BY STATE AGENCIES IN

01:14:07.543 --> 01:14:11.079
COORDINATION ORVILLE FALL SOME.

01:14:11.146 --> 01:14:12.781
TO WEAR THOSE SORTS OF THINGS IT

01:14:12.848 --> 01:14:14.650
LOOKS LIKE THERE'S A NEED FOR

01:14:14.716 --> 01:14:15.818
MORE.

01:14:15.884 --> 01:14:17.219
COORDINATION.

01:14:17.286 --> 01:14:19.087
OF INDEPENDENT AGENCIES EACH

01:14:19.154 --> 01:14:20.989
WITH A PIECE TO CONSENT WATER

01:14:21.056 --> 01:14:23.125
INTO THE COMMON CHANNEL.

01:14:23.192 --> 01:14:25.327
IS THAT MORE RECORD NATION.

01:14:25.394 --> 01:14:27.129
ON THE SAN JOAQUIN.

01:14:27.196 --> 01:14:28.697
AMONG PART RATES USE AS OPPOSED

01:14:28.764 --> 01:14:30.499
TO WITHIN.

01:14:30.566 --> 01:14:32.000
THE STATE D. W. R..

01:14:32.067 --> 01:14:33.535
AND HOW TO AND IS THAT WORK

01:14:33.602 --> 01:14:34.069
GENERALLY.

01:14:34.136 --> 01:14:36.104
PRETTY WELL YEAH I THINK YOU YOU

01:14:36.171 --> 01:14:38.407
MAKE A GREAT POINT THERE -- WE

01:14:38.473 --> 01:14:39.608
DO HAVE A SIMILAR FORECAST

01:14:39.675 --> 01:14:41.410
COURTED OPERATIONS GROUP ON THE

01:14:41.476 --> 01:14:42.544
SACRAMENTO SYSTEM PASSED BETWEEN

01:14:42.611 --> 01:14:44.546
THE HAVE TO ORVILLE AND AND THE

01:14:44.613 --> 01:14:45.547
FED I DON'T KNOW WHEN THE WATER

01:14:45.614 --> 01:14:46.949
FROM MORE OF BILL IS GOING TO

01:14:47.015 --> 01:14:49.017
PASS THE CONFUSED AMERICAN

01:14:49.084 --> 01:14:51.320
REVERSAL THAT FALL SOME WATER

01:14:51.386 --> 01:14:52.821
CAN. SEVEN BEHIND IT AND VICE

01:14:52.888 --> 01:14:57.626
VERSA. FOR EXAMPLE -- BUT HERE

01:14:57.693 --> 01:14:58.160
YEAH YOU'RE RIGHT THERE'S

01:14:58.227 --> 01:14:59.261
THERE'S MORE RESERVOIRS ON THE

01:14:59.328 --> 01:15:02.965
SAN JOAQUIN -- THERE'S LESS.

01:15:03.031 --> 01:15:04.633
THE STATE DOESN'T MAINTAIN.

01:15:04.700 --> 01:15:06.335
ANY OF THE SYSTEM ON THE SAN

01:15:06.401 --> 01:15:07.469
JOAQUIN RIVER THAT'S ALL

01:15:07.536 --> 01:15:09.004
MAINTAINED BY LOCAL LIVING

01:15:09.071 --> 01:15:12.174
MAINTAINING AGENCIES -- AND

01:15:12.241 --> 01:15:14.810
RECOGNIZING THE NEED FOR THE FOR

01:15:14.877 --> 01:15:16.411
ADDED COORDINATION AT THAT POOR

01:15:16.478 --> 01:15:17.679
LEVEL LIKE YOU SAID AT THE LOCAL

01:15:17.746 --> 01:15:20.582
LEVEL -- WE'VE THE THE STATE

01:15:20.649 --> 01:15:21.850
THROUGH ITS PROP TWENTY AND ON

01:15:21.917 --> 01:15:23.218
MY PROPERTY FOR FINDING US AS

01:15:23.285 --> 01:15:24.586
PUT SOME LOCAL ASSISTANCE

01:15:24.653 --> 01:15:29.191
DOLLARS OUT THERE -- TO THE TUNE

01:15:29.258 --> 01:15:30.158
OF ABOUT THIRTY FIVE MILLION

01:15:30.225 --> 01:15:33.996
DOLLARS TO ENCOURAGE LOCALS --

01:15:34.062 --> 01:15:35.230
THE LOCAL NOT LETTING

01:15:35.297 --> 01:15:35.797
MAINTAINING AGENCIES TO COME

01:15:35.864 --> 01:15:37.432
WHEN YOU COULD BE BETTER ALIGNED

01:15:37.499 --> 01:15:39.034
WITH THEIR COUNTY OFFICE OF

01:15:39.101 --> 01:15:40.836
EMERGENCY SERVICES.

01:15:40.903 --> 01:15:42.070
AND THOSE COUNTY OFFICES OFFICES

01:15:42.137 --> 01:15:43.672
OF THE BRITISH SERVICE TO BE

01:15:43.739 --> 01:15:48.310
MORE AWARE OF WHAT EACH OTHER'S --

01:15:48.377 --> 01:15:49.311
AND YOU KNOW IT'S WITH A LOT OF

01:15:49.378 --> 01:15:50.612
A LOT OF PLANNING AT THE LOCAL

01:15:50.679 --> 01:15:51.246
AND COUNTY LEVEL FOR EMERGENCIES

01:15:51.313 --> 01:15:52.714
FLOOD EMERGENCY SPECIFICALLY --

01:15:52.781 --> 01:15:54.483
TRAINING EXERCISES AT THE COUNTY

01:15:54.549 --> 01:15:57.052
LOCAL LEVEL AND THEN -- BUILDING

01:15:57.119 --> 01:15:59.254
STOCKPILES OF FLOOD BY MATERIALS

01:15:59.321 --> 01:16:02.557
AT THE COUNTY AND LOCAL LEVEL --

01:16:02.624 --> 01:16:03.392
DANIELLE.

01:16:03.458 --> 01:16:04.660
IT HAS BEEN A SUCCESS AND I

01:16:04.726 --> 01:16:06.128
THINK YOU'LL HEAR FROM ONE OF

01:16:06.194 --> 01:16:07.896
THE PANELLISTS LATER ON YOU CAN

01:16:07.963 --> 01:16:12.501
AND MAYBE SPEAK TO SOME OF THAT --

01:16:12.567 --> 01:16:13.435
AND SO YEAH THAT THAT THAT IS A

01:16:13.502 --> 01:16:13.869
NEED FOR FOR GREATER

01:16:13.936 --> 01:16:15.237
COMMUNICATION AND COORDINATION

01:16:15.304 --> 01:16:16.471
AT THE LOCAL LEVEL.

01:16:16.538 --> 01:16:19.374
IT HAD A SURE OF THAT ALL TWENTY

01:16:19.441 --> 01:16:19.875
CHANNELS ONLY SO LARGE.

01:16:19.942 --> 01:16:21.143
AND YOU CANNOT HAVE ALL THE

01:16:21.209 --> 01:16:23.445
AGENCIES SENDING WATER OFF THEIR

01:16:23.512 --> 01:16:24.980
LITTLE PIECE.

01:16:25.047 --> 01:16:26.348
IT WAS ALL GUNNA CONVERSION A

01:16:26.415 --> 01:16:28.183
POINT IN THE CHANNEL WORD.

01:16:28.250 --> 01:16:29.851
OVERFLOWS.

01:16:29.918 --> 01:16:31.853
SO YOU SORT OF HAVE TO HAVE A

01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:34.589
TIME IN A QUEUE IN SEQUENCE SEEN.

01:16:34.656 --> 01:16:36.224
IN PEOPLE AND FOR THOSE PIECES

01:16:36.291 --> 01:16:36.692
OUT.

01:16:36.758 --> 01:16:39.528
AND I'M GENERALLY FIRMER WAS OUT

01:16:39.594 --> 01:16:41.663
ON THE ON THE SACRAMENTAL -- AND

01:16:41.730 --> 01:16:44.166
I I I KNOW THAT YOU GUYS KNOW

01:16:44.232 --> 01:16:45.267
HOW LONG IT TAKES TO WATER FOR

01:16:45.334 --> 01:16:46.902
MORE REAL TO PASS THE CONFLUENCE

01:16:46.969 --> 01:16:48.670
OF THE AMERICAN RIVER OR THE

01:16:48.737 --> 01:16:50.639
WHERE WHEN IT'S OPEN AND AND

01:16:50.706 --> 01:16:51.506
CONSEQUENTLY.

01:16:51.573 --> 01:16:53.175
WHEN WHEN RELEASE COULD BE MADE

01:16:53.241 --> 01:16:55.877
FROM FULSOME AND TRAVEL -- DOWN

01:16:55.944 --> 01:16:58.447
PAST MY CITY AND IT JUST.

01:16:58.513 --> 01:17:01.016
THE THE TIMING OF ALL THESE

01:17:01.083 --> 01:17:03.018
PIECES I JUST SORT OF ASSUMED AT

01:17:03.085 --> 01:17:04.619
THE STATE LEVEL ON THE NORTH ON

01:17:04.686 --> 01:17:06.021
THE SACRAMENTO RIVER.

01:17:06.088 --> 01:17:07.756
IT WAS GOT THAT HANDLED.

01:17:07.823 --> 01:17:09.691
AND YOU MANAGE MORE THAT IN

01:17:09.758 --> 01:17:11.326
HOUSE.

01:17:11.393 --> 01:17:13.261
AS OPPOSED TO NEEDED IT JUST

01:17:13.328 --> 01:17:13.829
CORD AND EVERYONE WITH THEIR

01:17:13.895 --> 01:17:15.998
PIECE.

01:17:16.064 --> 01:17:18.000
I'D I'D SAY IT'S SETTLED -- I

01:17:18.066 --> 01:17:18.867
WOULDN'T CALL IT IN HOUSE I

01:17:18.934 --> 01:17:20.402
WOULDN'T WE'RE NOT WE'RE WE'RE

01:17:20.469 --> 01:17:21.636
NOT TRAFFIC COPS OUT THERE THAT

01:17:21.703 --> 01:17:22.971
ARE YOU KNOW.

01:17:23.038 --> 01:17:24.206
IT'S MORE OF A ROUND ABOUT.

01:17:24.272 --> 01:17:26.308
THAT IS THAT A FOUR WAY STOP.

01:17:26.375 --> 01:17:27.776
IF THERE IS MAYBE THE WAY I'D.

01:17:27.843 --> 01:17:29.211
WELL I DEFINITELY SEE THAT ON

01:17:29.277 --> 01:17:32.447
THE SAN JOAQUIN AYE AYE ME MY

01:17:32.514 --> 01:17:34.149
SENSE IS THERE'S MORE STATE.

01:17:34.216 --> 01:17:36.051
CONTROL ON THE SACRAMENTAL THE

01:17:36.118 --> 01:17:38.420
NORTHERN END MAYBE I'M.

01:17:38.487 --> 01:17:39.388
YES TO SIMPLISTIC WHEN I WOULD

01:17:39.454 --> 01:17:40.956
LIKE TO JUST ADD IT'S IN CONTEXT

01:17:41.023 --> 01:17:41.823
AND LOT OF PEOPLE ARE FAMILIAR

01:17:41.890 --> 01:17:43.625
WITH THIS THE THE SAN JOAQUIN I

01:17:43.692 --> 01:17:45.527
THINK BIãU IS MEMBERS ARE

01:17:45.594 --> 01:17:46.695
AWARE THIS THE MOUNTAINS THERE

01:17:46.762 --> 01:17:48.430
ARE HIGHER HITS THE SNOW BASIN.

01:17:48.497 --> 01:17:50.599
THE RESERVOIRS IN THE SACRAMENTO

01:17:50.665 --> 01:17:52.601
BASE ARE ACTUALLY A BIT YOUNGER --

01:17:52.667 --> 01:17:54.836
THEY WERE NEWER FACILITIES AND

01:17:54.903 --> 01:17:55.904
WE HAVE LEARNED FROM SOME OF THE

01:17:55.971 --> 01:17:57.472
LESSONS ON HOW TO COORDINATE

01:17:57.539 --> 01:17:59.574
EARLY ON IN THE FIFTIES THE

01:17:59.641 --> 01:18:01.309
CHALLENGES IN THE SAN JOAQUIN.

01:18:01.376 --> 01:18:03.845
SO WHEN THE FLOOD CONTROL POLLS

01:18:03.912 --> 01:18:05.580
WERE ESTABLISHED FOR WELL NEW

01:18:05.647 --> 01:18:07.449
BULLARD SPARSE ON THE FEATHER

01:18:07.516 --> 01:18:09.518
AND THE UNIVERSE THERE WAS A

01:18:09.584 --> 01:18:11.753
JOINT OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATION

01:18:11.820 --> 01:18:13.155
THAT WAS PUT INTO THAT FLOOD

01:18:13.221 --> 01:18:13.922
OPERATION THERE.

01:18:13.989 --> 01:18:15.957
SO THERE THE REASON THAT YOU

01:18:16.024 --> 01:18:16.658
HAVE.

01:18:16.725 --> 01:18:18.360
EARLIER COORDINATION ON THE

01:18:18.427 --> 01:18:20.028
SACRAMENTO BASIN IT WAS ACTUALLY

01:18:20.095 --> 01:18:24.332
PLACED INTO THE ACTUAL RULES OF

01:18:24.399 --> 01:18:29.504
HOW THEY WOULD WORK TOGETHER.

01:18:29.571 --> 01:18:31.773
I HAD A COUPLE.

01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:33.475
A COUPLE QUESTIONS -- AND I

01:18:33.542 --> 01:18:35.510
WOULD DRAW BOTH THE COMMITTEE'S

01:18:35.577 --> 01:18:36.878
ATTENTION AND THE PANELS

01:18:36.945 --> 01:18:38.713
ATTENTION.

01:18:38.780 --> 01:18:39.915
TO THIS IS DOCTOR THE DOCUMENT

01:18:39.981 --> 01:18:41.349
TAKING ACTION TO REDUCE

01:18:41.416 --> 01:18:43.518
RESIDENTIAL FUND RISK IF WE GO

01:18:43.585 --> 01:18:44.886
TO PAGE.

01:18:44.953 --> 01:18:45.587
SEVEN WE HAVE RESERVOIR

01:18:45.654 --> 01:18:48.957
CONDITIONS AND SNOW ABOUT

01:18:49.024 --> 01:18:49.257
[inaudible]

01:18:49.324 --> 01:18:52.260
TWENTY NINETY A AND IT WOULD

01:18:52.327 --> 01:18:54.362
JUST A QUICK.

01:18:54.429 --> 01:18:57.265
CLICK GLIMPSE OF THIS DOCUMENT --

01:18:57.332 --> 01:18:59.734
WHAT'S CONCERNING.

01:18:59.801 --> 01:19:02.571
IS CERTAIN RIVERS.

01:19:02.637 --> 01:19:04.639
WELL DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE

01:19:04.706 --> 01:19:06.341
SAN JOAQUIN FOR EXAMPLE.

01:19:06.408 --> 01:19:07.676
HAVE SNOW MELT.

01:19:07.742 --> 01:19:09.177
AND I SERVICES AND THOUSAND ACRE

01:19:09.244 --> 01:19:12.914
FEET RISE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT --

01:19:12.981 --> 01:19:14.749
A 10% CHANCE OF THE WORK WORST

01:19:14.816 --> 01:19:16.585
CASE SCENARIO WHAT WAS AT ONE

01:19:16.651 --> 01:19:18.053
POINT SIX MILLION.

01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:19.955
ACRE FEET OF WATER IN THE SNOW

01:19:20.021 --> 01:19:21.056
MELT.

01:19:21.123 --> 01:19:22.924
THAT'S A 10% CHANCE AND THE

01:19:22.991 --> 01:19:25.727
RESERVOIR CAPACITY IS DOWN AT

01:19:25.794 --> 01:19:30.899
WHAT SEE. 65% CAP ON IS THAT

01:19:30.966 --> 01:19:31.533
LESS THAN A HALF A MILLION ACRE

01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:33.702
FEET.

01:19:33.768 --> 01:19:34.035
I THINK IT IS.

01:19:34.102 --> 01:19:35.871
YEAH.

01:19:35.937 --> 01:19:37.105
SO.

01:19:37.172 --> 01:19:38.507
IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THAT AND

01:19:38.573 --> 01:19:40.208
THEN YOU TAKE YOUR EYES AND HEAD

01:19:40.275 --> 01:19:42.377
UP TO THE TOP LEFT CORNER HERE

01:19:42.444 --> 01:19:44.713
WITH THE SACRAMENTO RIVER BASIN.

01:19:44.779 --> 01:19:46.781
THEY'RE SITTING ON FOUR AND A

01:19:46.848 --> 01:19:47.349
HALF MILLION ACRE FEET OF

01:19:47.415 --> 01:19:48.416
STORAGE.

01:19:48.483 --> 01:19:51.887
AND THEIR CAP IS AT 94% OF THAT --

01:19:51.953 --> 01:19:53.221
WHATEVER THAT WORKS OUT TO A

01:19:53.288 --> 01:19:54.156
LITTLE OVER FOUR MILLION ACRE

01:19:54.222 --> 01:19:54.756
FEET.

01:19:54.823 --> 01:19:57.125
OF STORAGE AND AND IF YOU LOOK

01:19:57.192 --> 01:19:58.493
TO THIS THE SNOW PACK THERE IS

01:19:58.560 --> 01:20:02.631
OBVIOUSLY SO MY POINT BEING.

01:20:02.697 --> 01:20:04.533
IN SOME RIVERS WE'VE GOT LOTS OF

01:20:04.599 --> 01:20:07.536
STORAGE.

01:20:07.602 --> 01:20:09.638
AND SMALLER SNOW PACKS AND THEN

01:20:09.704 --> 01:20:11.373
DOWN HERE WE'VE GOT BIG SNOW

01:20:11.439 --> 01:20:13.642
PACKS AND NOT ENOUGH STORAGE IT

01:20:13.708 --> 01:20:15.343
LOOKS LIKE -- WHICH TELLS ME

01:20:15.410 --> 01:20:17.245
THAT WE'RE RELEASING A LOT OF

01:20:17.312 --> 01:20:19.147
WATER IF WE HIT THAT 10%

01:20:19.214 --> 01:20:21.149
SITUATION AND OR WERE FLOODING

01:20:21.216 --> 01:20:23.151
RIGHT.

01:20:23.218 --> 01:20:23.718
YEAH IT IS THAT AN ACCURATE

01:20:23.785 --> 01:20:24.019
STATEMENT.

01:20:24.085 --> 01:20:26.454
AND SO TO THE LAY PERSON OR THE

01:20:26.521 --> 01:20:27.923
COMMONSENSE PERSON.

01:20:27.989 --> 01:20:29.357
YOU WOULD THINK WE NEED TO BUILD

01:20:29.424 --> 01:20:31.259
SOME MORE STORAGE ON THIS

01:20:31.326 --> 01:20:32.727
PARTICULAR RIVERS.

01:20:32.794 --> 01:20:35.463
IN ORDER.

01:20:35.530 --> 01:20:36.498
TO ACHIEVE.

01:20:36.565 --> 01:20:38.200
YOUR BETTER FLOOD CONTROL

01:20:38.266 --> 01:20:39.434
SITUATION.

01:20:39.501 --> 01:20:41.203
AT LEAST HAVE SOME.

01:20:41.269 --> 01:20:42.404
HELLO FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT OR

01:20:42.470 --> 01:20:43.371
SAYS SOMETHING THERE'S GOT TO BE

01:20:43.438 --> 01:20:46.408
SOME ADDITION -- WHAT WOULD YOU

01:20:46.474 --> 01:20:50.412
ALL SUGGEST -- I IT'S ACTUALLY

01:20:50.478 --> 01:20:51.346
THE PORTFOLIO JUST LIKE

01:20:51.413 --> 01:20:52.514
SUGGESTED OUT THERE IT'S A

01:20:52.581 --> 01:20:56.718
COMBINATION OF ACTIONS -- KING

01:20:56.785 --> 01:20:57.319
TO THE HAND OUT ONE WHERE YOU

01:20:57.385 --> 01:20:58.587
CAN KIND OF A HIGH LEVEL SEE

01:20:58.653 --> 01:21:00.422
SOME OF THOSE -- THERE'S THE

01:21:00.488 --> 01:21:02.891
OPPORTUNITY TO GO THROUGH --

01:21:02.958 --> 01:21:04.526
OVER TIME AND TALK ABOUT WHAT

01:21:04.593 --> 01:21:06.628
THAT YELLOW PORTION NOW.

01:21:06.695 --> 01:21:07.762
CALL THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER BASIN

01:21:07.829 --> 01:21:09.297
IS OUT THERE THAT FLOOD CONTROL

01:21:09.364 --> 01:21:10.398
POOL IS.

01:21:10.465 --> 01:21:12.200
A THREE OPERATION REDEFINED THE

01:21:12.267 --> 01:21:13.768
YELLOW VERSES THE BLUE SO THAT

01:21:13.835 --> 01:21:15.170
YOU HAVE MORE SPACE IN THE

01:21:15.237 --> 01:21:16.538
YELLOW TO PUT.

01:21:16.605 --> 01:21:18.173
THE SNOW INTO WHICH IS I THINK

01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:19.441
WHAT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:21:19.507 --> 01:21:21.676
THAT'S ONE OPTION -- RACHEL

01:21:21.743 --> 01:21:23.778
TALKED EARLIER IN HER PORTFOLIO

01:21:23.845 --> 01:21:25.113
DISCUSSING THAT AS THE STATE

01:21:25.180 --> 01:21:26.014
ACTIONS OUT THERE THERE'S THE

01:21:26.081 --> 01:21:28.550
OPPORTUNITIES TO SEEK EASEMENTS --

01:21:28.617 --> 01:21:30.919
DOWNSTREAM AND IDENTIFY AREAS

01:21:30.986 --> 01:21:32.954
WHERE THE THE THE ACTUAL

01:21:33.021 --> 01:21:34.089
CONSEQUENCES OF FLOODING OUR

01:21:34.155 --> 01:21:36.191
LAST AND THOSE ARE JUST TWO

01:21:36.258 --> 01:21:38.126
EXAMPLES OF THINGS WE COULD GO

01:21:38.193 --> 01:21:39.728
THREE NEW -- THE THIRD THING

01:21:39.794 --> 01:21:41.363
THAT I POINT OUT IS IN SOME

01:21:41.429 --> 01:21:42.430
SMALL INSTANCES THROUGH

01:21:42.497 --> 01:21:43.765
PROPOSITION ONE THE STATE IS

01:21:43.832 --> 01:21:45.467
INVESTING TO TWO POINT SEVEN

01:21:45.533 --> 01:21:47.135
BILLION DOLLARS IN STORAGE

01:21:47.202 --> 01:21:50.939
PROJECTS ONE ON EXACTLY THAT

01:21:51.006 --> 01:21:52.040
POINT.

01:21:52.107 --> 01:21:53.041
IT WAS AS A MEMBER WHO IS HERE

01:21:53.108 --> 01:21:55.543
WHEN WE MOVE FORWARD WAS STORAGE

01:21:55.610 --> 01:21:56.378
FUNDING.

01:21:56.444 --> 01:21:58.179
WITH THE CONCEPT THAT THAT

01:21:58.246 --> 01:21:59.814
STORAGE FRONT WOULD ACHIEVE IN

01:21:59.881 --> 01:22:01.049
THIS EXACT REASONS THEY WERE

01:22:01.116 --> 01:22:02.984
TALKING ABOUT -- INVESTMENT

01:22:03.051 --> 01:22:05.420
INTERPRETS FIGHT RESERVOIR WHICH

01:22:05.487 --> 01:22:07.188
I BELIEVE IS ON THE SAN JOAQUIN.

01:22:07.255 --> 01:22:09.357
YOUR CORRECT YES IN THE END YOU

01:22:09.424 --> 01:22:13.762
KNOW HOW MANY ACRE FEET -- THAT

01:22:13.828 --> 01:22:15.130
POTENTIAL PROJECT WOULD HAVE --

01:22:15.196 --> 01:22:15.730
STORED.

01:22:15.797 --> 01:22:17.632
I DON'T KNOW THE EXACT NUMBER ON

01:22:17.699 --> 01:22:19.934
THAT HOWEVER I CAN'T CONFIRM

01:22:20.001 --> 01:22:22.137
THAT THAT PARTICULAR PROJECT --

01:22:22.203 --> 01:22:22.871
DOES HAVE WHAT WE CALL

01:22:22.937 --> 01:22:24.639
INCIDENTAL FLOOD RISK BENEFITS

01:22:24.706 --> 01:22:26.975
IN THE STATUS COST SHARING TO

01:22:27.042 --> 01:22:29.944
ADDRESS THAT VERY ISSUE -- IT

01:22:30.011 --> 01:22:31.346
JUST STRIKES ME AGAIN THAT YOU

01:22:31.413 --> 01:22:33.448
KNOW IN SOME AREAS WE'VE GOT WAY

01:22:33.515 --> 01:22:34.783
WHAT WE HAVE ADEQUATE STORAGE

01:22:34.849 --> 01:22:37.052
OTHERS WE DON'T AND I'M NOT SURE

01:22:37.118 --> 01:22:37.952
THAT WE'RE MOVING FORWARD TO

01:22:38.019 --> 01:22:38.453
WHERE I KNOW THE WATER

01:22:38.520 --> 01:22:39.888
COMMISSION SCORED SOME OF THESE

01:22:39.954 --> 01:22:42.824
PROJECTS THAT WE THAT WE FUNDED.

01:22:42.891 --> 01:22:45.060
THROUGH THE WATER BOND -- AT

01:22:45.126 --> 01:22:48.129
LEVELS THAT YOU MAY NOT SEE THEM --

01:22:48.196 --> 01:22:49.764
BUILT AND THIS.

01:22:49.831 --> 01:22:51.633
IS CONCERNING AND IT DOESN'T SEE

01:22:51.700 --> 01:22:52.534
LIKE DOES HE LIKE REPORT WE'RE

01:22:52.600 --> 01:22:55.070
MAKING AVAILABLE ALL THE TOOLS.

01:22:55.136 --> 01:22:56.838
FOR FLOOD MANAGEMENT AND I'M

01:22:56.905 --> 01:22:59.040
KIND OF CURIOUS.

01:22:59.107 --> 01:23:00.342
WHY THAT IS SIR IF THE AND AND

01:23:00.408 --> 01:23:02.744
WHY IS THAT NOT IN THE STATE

01:23:02.811 --> 01:23:04.612
MANAGEMENT -- PORTFOLIO WE WILL

01:23:04.679 --> 01:23:05.714
GET BACK TO THE PATERNAL FIRST

01:23:05.780 --> 01:23:07.982
CALIFORNIA THE ESTABLISH OF THE

01:23:08.049 --> 01:23:12.787
S. P. FC.

01:23:12.854 --> 01:23:15.323
WHY DID THAT NOT MOVE UPSTREAM --

01:23:15.390 --> 01:23:15.490
UP.

01:23:15.557 --> 01:23:16.558
BUT A LITTLE BIT OF THAT AND I

01:23:16.624 --> 01:23:17.192
THINK THE SECOND PANEL PROBABLY

01:23:17.258 --> 01:23:17.792
WOULD WANNA PROBABLY ADDRESS

01:23:17.859 --> 01:23:20.328
THAT AS WELL -- THE STATE PLAN A

01:23:20.395 --> 01:23:22.330
FLOOD CONTROL THE ONLY RESERVOIR

01:23:22.397 --> 01:23:23.898
THAT'S ACTUALLY PART OF THAT

01:23:23.965 --> 01:23:25.633
SYSTEM IS OR BILL BECAUSE THE

01:23:25.700 --> 01:23:27.068
STATE ACTUALLY OWNS OR BILL

01:23:50.692 --> 01:23:52.026
HOW DOES THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER

01:23:52.093 --> 01:23:53.995

THEIR OWN GAUGING NETWORK SO

01:26:30.552 --> 01:26:31.953
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

01:26:32.020 --> 01:26:33.488
ON THE RESERVOIR OPERATORS

01:26:33.555 --> 01:26:34.289
THEY'VE GOT THEIR OWN CITY

01:26:34.355 --> 01:26:36.324
GAUGES THAT WE ALL SHARE

01:26:36.391 --> 01:26:39.060

SAN JOAQUIN SYSTEM WERE GETTING

01:26:49.537 --> 01:26:51.773
DATA REAL TIME -- AND THEN PUT

01:26:51.839 --> 01:26:52.674
THE BOOK WILL THE RESERVOIR

01:26:52.740 --> 01:26:54.042
OPERATORS YOU GOT.

01:26:54.108 --> 01:26:55.243
TO THAT THE COUNTY EMERGENCY

01:26:55.310 --> 01:27:00.014
MANAGERS AND THE LOCAL LIVING

01:27:00.081 --> 01:27:01.716
MAINTAINING AGENCIES -- THE

01:27:01.783 --> 01:27:02.784
FOLKS THAT ARE ON THE GROUND THE

01:27:02.850 --> 01:27:03.451
OF THE WONDER TO PEOPLE THAT ARE

01:27:03.518 --> 01:27:04.786
OUT THERE PATROLLING LEVEES

01:27:04.852 --> 01:27:06.654
DURING HIGH WATER DANCE --

01:27:06.721 --> 01:27:08.690
MAKING THAT INITIAL ATTACK ON AN

01:27:08.756 --> 01:27:10.458
INCIDENT IT'S A RELIGION SIDE OR

01:27:10.525 --> 01:27:13.695
A BOILER SOME KIND OF SEEPAGE --

01:27:13.761 --> 01:27:14.295

01:27:14.929 --> 01:27:16.631
INFORM.

01:27:16.698 --> 01:27:17.398
BUT MY NEXT QUESTION WOULD BE

01:27:17.465 --> 01:27:19.334
AROUND THE THE SMALLER RIVERS.

01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:21.936
AND THEY MAY NOT HAVE -- THE

01:27:22.003 --> 01:27:23.471
FLOOD MANAGEMENT INFRASTRUCTURE

01:27:23.538 --> 01:27:24.505
IN PLACE.

01:27:24.572 --> 01:27:25.907
WHAT WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE

01:27:25.974 --> 01:27:28.009
FROM YOUR?

01:27:28.076 --> 01:27:30.278
PERSPECTIVE IN WHAT ARE WE DOING

01:27:30.345 --> 01:27:31.946
TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S CONSTANT

01:27:32.013 --> 01:27:34.415
RISK MANAGEMENT ASSESSMENT AND

01:27:34.482 --> 01:27:38.086
KEEPING -- THOSE PARTNERS - IN

01:27:38.152 --> 01:27:39.887
THE LOOP.

01:27:39.954 --> 01:27:41.389
I'LL TAKE A CRACK AT THAT ONE

NEED.

01:30:56.651 --> 01:30:59.320
ALWAYS IN THE MULTIPLE TENS OF

01:30:59.387 --> 01:31:01.789
BILLIONS -- OF DOLLARS ACROSS

01:31:01.856 --> 01:31:03.891
THE STATE I THINK IT WAS WAS IT

01:31:03.958 --> 01:31:04.926
TWENTY BILLION IN THE CENTRAL

01:31:04.992 --> 01:31:06.861
VALLEY FLOOD PROTECTION PLAN --

01:31:06.928 --> 01:31:08.796
JUST FOR THE CENTRAL VALLEY --

01:31:08.863 --> 01:31:09.831
SOME OF THE OTHER ESTIMATES I'VE

01:31:09.897 --> 01:31:11.165
SEEN I'VE BEEN KIND OF IN THE

01:31:11.232 --> 01:31:12.366
FIFTY BILLION DOLLAR RANGE

01:31:12.433 --> 01:31:15.303
ACROSS THE STATE -- FOR FOR

01:31:15.369 --> 01:31:16.604
FLOOD MANAGEMENT THAT WOULD BE

01:31:16.671 --> 01:31:17.872
ACROSS MULTIPLE DECADES AND I

01:31:17.939 --> 01:31:19.106
WAS SO THAT'S NOT A SINGLE YEAR

01:31:19.173 --> 01:31:21.275
ESTIMATE BUT IN TERMS OF NEEDS

01:31:21.342 --> 01:31:22.944
SO SO CLEARLY AND NOT A LOT OF

01:31:23.010 --> 01:31:24.145
NEED OUT THERE I WOULD JUST

01:31:24.212 --> 01:31:26.247
AGAIN HIGHLIGHT -- THAT

01:31:26.314 --> 01:31:28.783
TYPICALLY THE FUNDING COMES FROM

01:31:28.850 --> 01:31:30.518
MULTIPLE SOURCES LOCAL FEDERAL

01:31:30.585 --> 01:31:32.053
AND STATE AND THE STATE HAS NOT

01:31:32.119 --> 01:31:34.455
BEEN THE LARGEST SOURCE IN IN

01:31:34.522 --> 01:31:36.824
THOSE FUNDS BUT WIND THE STATE

01:31:36.891 --> 01:31:38.593

TO THE HUNDRED BILLION THAT'S A

01:32:33.214 --> 01:32:34.916
GAS THAT THESE WOULD BE THE NEXT

01:32:34.982 --> 01:32:35.716
LEVEL OF PROJECTS THAT WOULD

01:32:35.783 --> 01:32:37.118
COME.

01:32:37.184 --> 01:32:37.752
TO CONTINUE TO REDUCE THE FLOOD

01:32:37.818 --> 01:32:40.154
RISK.

01:32:40.221 --> 01:32:42.390
HELLO TO DOUBLE DOWN ON THE

01:32:42.456 --> 01:32:44.992
CHAIRMAN'S QUESTION -- IF WE

HAVE THE NUMBER PICKED AT FIFTY

01:32:46.560 --> 01:32:47.728
AND WE'VE DONE.

01:32:47.795 --> 01:32:50.731
SEVERAL WATER BONDS -- IN RECENT

01:32:50.798 --> 01:32:53.301
MEMORY.

01:32:53.367 --> 01:32:55.236
HOW MUCH OF HOW HOW MUCH OF WE

01:32:55.303 --> 01:32:56.971
DONE AND WHAT IN WATER BONDS

01:32:57.038 --> 01:32:59.006
HERE IN TOTAL AND HOW DOES THAT

01:32:59.073 --> 01:33:00.875
COMPARE TO THE FIFTY BILLION AND

01:33:00.942 --> 01:33:03.444
AND OF THE NUMBER THAT WE'VE

01:33:03.511 --> 01:33:04.679
DONE AND WATER BONDS?

01:33:04.745 --> 01:33:06.180
HOW MUCH OF IT ACTUALLY GOES TO

01:33:06.247 --> 01:33:07.982
FIXING ANY OF THAT FIFTY BILLION

01:33:08.049 --> 01:33:09.450
DOLLAR?

01:33:09.517 --> 01:33:10.584
ISSUE SO ON PAGE FIVE OF THE

01:33:10.651 --> 01:33:11.986
HAND OUT THERE'S A FIGURE THAT

01:33:12.053 --> 01:33:14.255
SHOWS -- OVER THE PAST TWO

01:33:14.322 --> 01:33:16.691
DECADES THE PROPORTION OF THE

01:33:16.757 --> 01:33:18.092
BONDS THAT HAVE PASSED THAT IT

01:33:18.159 --> 01:33:20.628
HAD FUNDING SPECIFICALLY FOR

01:33:20.695 --> 01:33:22.396
FLOOD MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES --

01:33:22.463 --> 01:33:28.336
SO FIVE POINT SIX BILLION

01:33:28.402 --> 01:33:28.636
[inaudible]

01:33:28.703 --> 01:33:30.671
SO WITH.

01:33:30.738 --> 01:33:31.439
SO WHAT'S THAT TOTAL.

01:33:31.505 --> 01:33:33.040
SO FIVE POINT SIX BILLION HAS

01:33:33.107 --> 01:33:35.209
BEEN DEDICATED FROM WATER BONDS

01:33:35.276 --> 01:33:37.678
OVER THE PAST TWO DECADES FOR

01:33:37.745 --> 01:33:39.413
FLOOD MANAGEMENT SPECIFICALLY.

01:33:39.480 --> 01:33:39.947
OF A FIFTY BILLION DOLLAR

01:33:40.014 --> 01:33:42.683
PROBLEM.

01:33:42.750 --> 01:33:44.085
CORRECT BUT AGAIN I THINK AS

01:33:44.151 --> 01:33:45.953
NOTED THAT FIFTY BILLION DOLLAR

01:33:46.020 --> 01:33:47.488
ESTIMATE WAS PROJECTS TO

01:33:47.555 --> 01:33:50.324
ANTICIPATED NOT THAT THE STATE

01:33:50.391 --> 01:33:51.826
WOULD WOULD PLAY THAT.

01:33:51.892 --> 01:33:53.761
BE THE SOLE FINDER IT IS STORE

01:33:53.828 --> 01:33:54.729
KLAY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND

01:33:54.795 --> 01:33:56.197
WHAT ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF SOME OF%

01:33:56.263 --> 01:33:58.899
THE BIG PROJECTS STATE FAIR

01:33:58.966 --> 01:34:01.168

THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS.

01:34:02.269 --> 01:34:03.604
CHOSEN TO INVEST IN WHICH I

01:34:03.671 --> 01:34:05.206
THINK IT IS.

01:34:05.272 --> 01:34:06.574
LAW EMITTED.

01:34:06.640 --> 01:34:07.174
A WOMAN'S LAST TIME THEY MADE

01:34:07.241 --> 01:34:07.775
ONE OF THOSE INVESTMENTS READ

01:34:07.842 --> 01:34:10.811
VERY RECENTLY YEAH IN THE PAST

01:34:10.878 --> 01:34:13.514
FEW MONTHS -- CURRENTLY THERE'S

01:34:13.581 --> 01:34:16.283
A TWO BILLION DOLLAR -- SPECIAL

01:34:16.350 --> 01:34:17.518
INITIATIVE FOR THE ARMY CORPS OF

01:34:17.585 --> 01:34:18.953
ENGINEERS TO INVEST IN THEIR

01:34:19.020 --> 01:34:20.521
COST SHARING THE PROJECTS AND

01:34:20.588 --> 01:34:21.422
INVESTED.

01:34:21.489 --> 01:34:22.690
ARE IDENTIFIED WITHIN THE FLOOD

01:34:22.757 --> 01:34:23.958
PLAN AND UP PART OF THE REASON

01:34:24.025 --> 01:34:25.393
THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WAS

01:34:25.459 --> 01:34:26.894
ABLE TO GET THAT TWO BILLION

01:34:26.961 --> 01:34:28.529
DOLLARS WHICH WE STILL HAVE TO

01:34:28.596 --> 01:34:30.765
GET -- WAS THEY LOOKED AT THE

01:34:30.831 --> 01:34:32.700
ACTUAL LIST OF PROJECTS ALONG

01:34:32.767 --> 01:34:34.535
WITH ALL THE OTHER ACTIONS IN

01:34:34.602 --> 01:34:35.970
THE CONFERENCE PORTFOLIO.

01:34:36.037 --> 01:34:37.938
THAT -- THE LOCALS IN THE STATE

01:34:38.005 --> 01:34:39.073
HAVE BEEN WORKING THROUGH OUR

01:34:39.140 --> 01:34:41.308
PLANNING EFFORTS TO THE BUILDING

01:34:41.375 --> 01:34:43.511
AND THEN A FIVE IT WE HAVE THE

01:34:43.577 --> 01:34:44.612
NUMBER THE TOTAL WATER BOND

01:34:44.678 --> 01:34:45.679
NUMBER FRIENDLY DREW MY

01:34:45.746 --> 01:34:46.947
ATTENTION TO THE FIVE BILLION

01:34:47.014 --> 01:34:47.982
THAT'S GONE TOWARDS FLOOD

01:34:48.049 --> 01:34:49.316
MANAGEMENT BUT WHAT'S THE WHAT'S

01:34:49.383 --> 01:34:52.686
THE TOTAL AMOUNT THAT WE'VE.

01:34:52.753 --> 01:34:53.921
AUTHORIZED.

01:34:53.988 --> 01:34:54.989
I THINK IT'S AROUND THIRTY

01:34:55.056 --> 01:34:56.157
BILLION THIRTY ONE MAYBE SO OUT

01:34:56.223 --> 01:34:58.125
OF THIRTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS OF

01:34:58.192 --> 01:34:59.693
BONDS WE'VE WE'VE ALL THE

01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:02.596
ALLOCATED -- FIVE TWO THIS

01:35:02.663 --> 01:35:04.765
SUBJECT OF FUND MANAGEMENT SINCE

01:35:04.832 --> 01:35:06.000
YOU DO HAVE WATER PARKS CRACKS

01:35:06.067 --> 01:35:07.168
THAT THIRTY ONE BILLION IT WATER

01:35:07.234 --> 01:35:08.502
AND RESOURCES SO THERE'S MANY

01:35:08.569 --> 01:35:09.403
FOR PARKS AND OTHER NATURAL

01:35:09.470 --> 01:35:11.338
RESOURCES IN IN THOSE BONDS BUT

01:35:11.405 --> 01:35:13.107
OF THE NATURAL RESOURCES BOND

01:35:13.174 --> 01:35:15.176
SINCE TWO THOUSAND I THINK IT'S

01:35:15.242 --> 01:35:15.776
THIRTY ONE BILLION.

01:35:15.843 --> 01:35:18.779
LET ME DRAW YOUR ATTENTION BACK.

01:35:18.846 --> 01:35:22.283
TO MY FAVORITE CHART HERE -- OF

01:35:22.349 --> 01:35:23.851
ALL THOSE RIVERS IF WE GOT TO

01:35:23.918 --> 01:35:25.419
THE 10% PROBABILITY OF THE SNOW

01:35:25.486 --> 01:35:27.588
MELT.

01:35:27.655 --> 01:35:28.923
WHERE WHERE'S THE GREATEST FLOOD

01:35:28.989 --> 01:35:35.329
RISK?

01:35:35.396 --> 01:35:36.363
AB.

01:35:36.430 --> 01:35:38.399
IN THE HERE AND NOW -- USUALLY

01:35:38.466 --> 01:35:39.900
WERE WERE REALLY WORRIED ABOUT

01:35:39.967 --> 01:35:42.203
THE URBAN POPULATIONS SO LOOKING

01:35:42.269 --> 01:35:44.038
UP THERE WE WOULD BE USUALLY

01:35:44.105 --> 01:35:45.906
WORRIED ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING

01:35:45.973 --> 01:35:47.775
UP IN THE SACRAMENTO REGION.

01:35:47.842 --> 01:35:51.145
BUT THE WHAT WE DON'T ALWAYS

01:35:51.212 --> 01:35:54.281
FACTOR INTO THAT IS THE ACTUAL --

01:35:54.348 --> 01:35:56.250
REAL TIME FIELD CONDITIONS OUT

01:35:56.317 --> 01:35:57.218
THERE MEANING THE CONDITIONS OF

01:35:57.284 --> 01:35:58.552
THE LEVEES THE ABILITY TO CONVEY

01:35:58.619 --> 01:36:00.421
THE FLOWS THROUGH.

01:36:00.488 --> 01:36:03.724
SO ANY GIVEN TIME YOU CRITICS.

01:36:03.791 --> 01:36:04.358
YOU HAVE THEIR RULE NUMBER ONE

01:36:04.425 --> 01:36:06.160
SHIP TO EXPECT THE UNEXPECTED

01:36:06.227 --> 01:36:07.728
THE FLOOD WILL NOT HAPPEN FOR

01:36:07.795 --> 01:36:09.396
YOU THINK IT WILL IT'S GONNA

01:36:09.463 --> 01:36:12.867
HAPPEN SOMEWHERE ELSE.

01:36:12.933 --> 01:36:16.737
I LET ME ASK THAT AGAIN -- WHERE

01:36:16.804 --> 01:36:19.540
WITH THE MOST FLOODING OCCUR NOT

01:36:19.607 --> 01:36:21.275
TAKE IN THE CONSIDERATION YOU

01:36:21.342 --> 01:36:22.476
KNOW YOUR PRIORITY LIST OF ALL

01:36:22.543 --> 01:36:25.146
WE'RE GONNA WE'RE GONNA LOOK AT

01:36:25.212 --> 01:36:25.713
AFTER THE URBAN FOLKS FIRST

01:36:25.779 --> 01:36:27.248
WHICH?

01:36:27.314 --> 01:36:29.483
SOUND OFF A LOT LIKE THE OPERATE

01:36:29.550 --> 01:36:30.684
KIND LIKE LEGISLATURE FROM.

01:36:30.751 --> 01:36:31.485
HERE.

01:36:31.552 --> 01:36:34.989
URBAN COMMUNITIES FIRST -- THAT

01:36:35.055 --> 01:36:36.790
ASIDE.

01:36:36.857 --> 01:36:37.424
WHO'S LEAST WHICH RIVERS LEAST

01:36:37.491 --> 01:36:39.793
PREPARED TO HANDLE THE SIZE OF

01:36:39.860 --> 01:36:42.329
THE STONE OUT.

01:36:42.396 --> 01:36:45.933
AT 10%.

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:47.701
YEAH I'D I'D I THINK IT IT'S

01:36:47.768 --> 01:36:48.969
STILL KIND OF DEPENDS I DON'T

01:36:49.036 --> 01:36:53.073
HAVE AN ANSWER FOR YOU ON THAT.

01:36:53.140 --> 01:36:55.509
CAN I ASK A RELATED QUESTION.

01:36:55.576 --> 01:36:55.843
WHICH COOLEY.

01:36:55.910 --> 01:36:57.578
I MEAN AREN'T.

01:36:57.645 --> 01:36:59.046
DON'T THESE SORTS OF ISSUES YOU

01:36:59.113 --> 01:37:01.315
KNOW WE'RE NOW IN MAY IF WE HAD

01:37:01.382 --> 01:37:03.817
A VERY SUSTAIN HOT PERIOD.

01:37:03.884 --> 01:37:07.188
ISN'T THAT WHAT WE WORRY ABOUT.

01:37:07.254 --> 01:37:08.289
IT'S YOU KNOW IN JANUARY IT'S

01:37:08.355 --> 01:37:09.924
ALWAYS YOU WORRY ABOUT THAT WARM

01:37:09.990 --> 01:37:11.759
RAIN STORM THAT IS ACTUALLY

01:37:11.825 --> 01:37:13.060
MELTING THE SNOW MELT AS A FALLS

01:37:13.127 --> 01:37:14.195
OUT OF THE SKIES.

01:37:14.261 --> 01:37:15.729
NOW REGIS WE'RE SORT OF STUCK

01:37:15.796 --> 01:37:18.332
WITH WE JUST HAVE A VERY SUSTAIN

01:37:18.399 --> 01:37:19.733
PERIOD OF HIGH HEAT.

01:37:19.800 --> 01:37:20.935
THE STAR CENTER WATER.

01:37:21.001 --> 01:37:23.170
I ACTUALLY DO KEEP THE YOU KNOW

01:37:23.237 --> 01:37:27.408
SOMEBODY -- HYDRAULIC HYDROLOGY

01:37:27.474 --> 01:37:30.277
ON MY PHONE SO I WATCHED.

01:37:30.344 --> 01:37:32.179
THE THE RIVER FLOW GOING UP AND

01:37:32.246 --> 01:37:35.583
DOWN -- ON A DAILY BASIS SO NOW

01:37:35.649 --> 01:37:36.383
I THINK WE'RE GETTING IN THE

01:37:36.450 --> 01:37:38.619
WARM TIME HERE WE IF WE GET

01:37:38.686 --> 01:37:39.987
INTENSE HEAT.

01:37:40.054 --> 01:37:40.788
IT'S JUST ARE SENATE WATER

01:37:40.854 --> 01:37:43.791
DOWNSTREAM AND THEN.

01:37:43.857 --> 01:37:44.625
YOU CAN'T HAVE THE WATER

01:37:44.692 --> 01:37:46.360
OVERTOPPING A SO YOU HAVE TO

01:37:46.427 --> 01:37:48.162
HAVE RELEASES.

01:37:48.229 --> 01:37:49.863
NO YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT IN ALL

01:37:49.930 --> 01:37:51.198
BUT CALL YOUR ATTENTION TO HAND

01:37:51.265 --> 01:37:53.000
OUT EIGHT AND THE PACKAGE THERE

01:37:53.067 --> 01:37:54.635
AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS IS GETTING

01:37:54.702 --> 01:37:55.502
A LITTLE IN OF THE THE DETAIL

01:37:55.569 --> 01:37:57.705
WEEKS BUT THIS IS EXACTLY.

01:37:57.771 --> 01:37:59.607
THE TYPES OF QUESTIONS THAT WE

01:37:59.673 --> 01:38:00.941
RUN THROUGH IN THE COMING UP THE

01:38:01.008 --> 01:38:02.543
OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS THAT ARE

01:38:02.610 --> 01:38:04.712
THE BASIS FOR THE RESERVOIR FOR

01:38:04.778 --> 01:38:06.981
NATIONS AND A HAND OUT EIGHT

01:38:07.047 --> 01:38:08.649
WHEN YOU LOOK ON THE BOTTOM HALF.

01:38:08.716 --> 01:38:11.452
YOU'LL SEE DOWN THERE IN -- THE

01:38:11.518 --> 01:38:13.254
IT'S REALLY THE BOTTOM HALF SORT

01:38:13.320 --> 01:38:14.688
OF THE UPPER RIGHT HAND CORNER

01:38:14.755 --> 01:38:16.757
IT SAYS F. IN F. FORECAST

01:38:16.824 --> 01:38:18.392
SELECTION HAVE TYPICAL WEATHER

01:38:18.459 --> 01:38:19.994
PATTERNS WET AVERAGE WITH THOSE

01:38:20.060 --> 01:38:21.695
ARE CHOOSE OUR BOXES.

01:38:21.762 --> 01:38:23.197
AND YOU CAN GO THROUGH IF YOU'RE

01:38:23.264 --> 01:38:25.733
REALLY RISK ADVERSE AND PUT IN A

01:38:25.799 --> 01:38:27.368
VERY WET.

01:38:27.434 --> 01:38:28.936
BUT WARM SCENARIO.

01:38:29.003 --> 01:38:29.937
AND THAT WILL THEN ALLOW THE

01:38:30.004 --> 01:38:32.006
TOOL TO GO THROUGH ND SHOW YOU

01:38:32.072 --> 01:38:33.807
HEY HERE'S MORE WATER THAT COULD

01:38:33.874 --> 01:38:35.542
POTENTIALLY COMING AS AN ACTUAL

01:38:35.609 --> 01:38:36.944
SNOW MELT QUICKER.

01:38:37.011 --> 01:38:38.579
AND THEN LOOK AT THE DASHBOARD

01:38:38.646 --> 01:38:39.780
AT THE TOP AND SEE HOW THAT

01:38:39.847 --> 01:38:41.015
SYSTEM IS RESPONDING TO THAT

01:38:41.081 --> 01:38:42.483
PARTICULAR SCENARIO SO EACH

01:38:42.549 --> 01:38:44.351
RESERVOIR OPERATOR HAS WITHIN

01:38:44.418 --> 01:38:45.486
THEIR TOOL KIT.

01:38:45.552 --> 01:38:46.487
THE ABILITY TO ASK THAT

01:38:46.553 --> 01:38:48.656
INDIVIDUAL QUESTION AND THEN

01:38:48.722 --> 01:38:50.491
THROUGH THE COORDINATION CALLS

01:38:50.557 --> 01:38:52.126
THEY SHARE THEIR EXPERIENCES.

01:38:52.192 --> 01:38:54.194
AND REALLY WHAT THE STATE'S ROLE

01:38:54.261 --> 01:38:55.863
IS TO HELP FACILITATE OKAY WHO

01:38:55.929 --> 01:38:57.197
CAN HOLD BACK.

01:38:57.264 --> 01:38:58.666
SO THAT THIS AREA WHERE WE SEE

01:38:58.732 --> 01:39:00.034
IT THIS PRESENT CONDITION A

01:39:00.100 --> 01:39:01.135
GREATER RISK.

01:39:01.201 --> 01:39:02.536
THEY CAN MOVE FIRST AND FORWARD

01:39:02.603 --> 01:39:04.471
IN TIME AND THE OTHER THING THAT

01:39:04.538 --> 01:39:06.340
WE DIDN'T HIGHLIGHT WE ARE

01:39:06.407 --> 01:39:07.775
COUNTING FOR THAT ROUTING OR

01:39:07.841 --> 01:39:09.410
THAT TIME TRAVEL OF THE WATER AS

01:39:09.476 --> 01:39:10.611
IT MOVES THERE SO IF YOU'RE

01:39:10.678 --> 01:39:12.246
FURTHER AWAY FROM A POINT OF

01:39:12.313 --> 01:39:16.784
CONCERN.

01:39:16.850 --> 01:39:18.385
THAT'S INCLUDED WITHIN THE TOOL.

01:39:18.452 --> 01:39:18.986
TO AND YOU HAVE A MODEL THAT

01:39:19.053 --> 01:39:20.821
COORDINATES.

01:39:20.888 --> 01:39:21.388
THE DOWNSTREAM RIVER CHANNEL

01:39:21.455 --> 01:39:23.123
WITH ALL THE OTHER FLOWS.

01:39:23.190 --> 01:39:24.391
BE BECAUSE IT'S THE CUMULATIVE

01:39:24.458 --> 01:39:25.459
AFFECT.

01:39:25.526 --> 01:39:27.328
IT'S LIKE YOU KNOW THE MERCED

01:39:27.394 --> 01:39:28.729
RIVER THE TO ALL OF ME.

01:39:28.796 --> 01:39:30.931
THE SAN JOAQUIN IT'S THE WATER

01:39:30.998 --> 01:39:32.333
THIS POINT TO ALL THOSE CHANNELS.

01:39:32.399 --> 01:39:33.600
THAT EVENTUALLY START DROPPING

01:39:33.667 --> 01:39:36.737
INTO THE INTO THE VALLEY FLOOR

01:39:36.804 --> 01:39:38.605
AND HAVE TO WORK THEIR WAY NORTH.

01:39:38.672 --> 01:39:39.973
INTO DELTA.

01:39:40.040 --> 01:39:41.408
THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT AND ON THE

01:39:41.475 --> 01:39:42.943
THE UPPER PANEL OF THAT SAME

01:39:43.010 --> 01:39:45.212
HAND OUT EIGHT THOSE GREEN DOTS

01:39:45.279 --> 01:39:47.081
WILL TURN OTHER COLORS WHEN WE

01:39:47.147 --> 01:39:48.449
START ACTUALLY SEEING WHAT WE

01:39:48.515 --> 01:39:49.917
CALL THE OBJECTIVE FUNCTIONS IS

01:39:49.983 --> 01:39:51.685
THE TECHNICAL TERM BUT IT'S THE

01:39:51.752 --> 01:39:53.087
CAPACITY OF THE CHANNELS.

01:39:53.153 --> 01:39:54.922
AT THOSE LOCATIONS WILL CHANGED

01:39:54.988 --> 01:39:56.090
OTHER COLORS.

01:39:56.156 --> 01:39:58.359
IN A SIMILAR COLOR NAMAN GLACIER

01:39:58.425 --> 01:39:59.860
TO WITH THE WEATHER SERVICE USES

01:39:59.927 --> 01:40:01.495
FOR THEIR TO ON THE WEB SO WE WE

01:40:01.562 --> 01:40:03.163
KIND OF KEPT WHERE PEOPLE ARE

01:40:03.230 --> 01:40:05.232
CONDITIONAL LIES. TO GREEN

01:40:05.299 --> 01:40:09.002
YELLOW RED AND ALL OF OUR TOOLS

01:40:09.069 --> 01:40:13.874
AND DASHBOARDS.

01:40:13.941 --> 01:40:15.542
ADVANCING TO SEE THIS WITH THE

01:40:15.609 --> 01:40:17.211
TIME IT WOULD TAKE FROM THEIR

01:40:17.277 --> 01:40:18.979
MAIN RESERVOIRS ON EACH OF THESE.

01:40:19.046 --> 01:40:20.114
RIVERS SLASH TRIBUTARIES TO WHEN

01:40:20.180 --> 01:40:21.615
THEY START ACTUALLY HITTING THE

01:40:21.682 --> 01:40:21.949
SAN JOAQUIN.

01:40:22.015 --> 01:40:27.054
JUST STANDARD WATER FLOW TIMES.

01:40:27.121 --> 01:40:28.322
DO YOU GUYS HAVE MODELING WHERE

01:40:28.389 --> 01:40:30.858
YOU COULD -- SHOW US WHAT.

01:40:30.924 --> 01:40:33.060
THAT 10% PROBABILITY OF THE

01:40:33.127 --> 01:40:33.961
LOOKS LIKE.

01:40:34.027 --> 01:40:38.232
AS FAR AS FIGHTING AGAINST.

01:40:38.298 --> 01:40:39.566
YEAH WE'VE GOT SOMETHING THAT WE

01:40:39.633 --> 01:40:40.834
CAN THAT WE DO AS PART JUST A

01:40:40.901 --> 01:40:43.303
PART OF OUR OPERATION IS IS

01:40:43.370 --> 01:40:43.871
WORKING WITH THE RESTAURANT

01:40:43.937 --> 01:40:44.471
WRITERS.

01:40:44.538 --> 01:40:45.806
TO AND WE WE RUN SOME WORST CASE

01:40:45.873 --> 01:40:46.774
SCENARIOS OURSELVES AS A

01:40:46.840 --> 01:40:49.109
DEPARTMENT. TO TO KNOW WHERE --

01:40:49.176 --> 01:40:50.778
NETWORK WHERE WE MIGHT BE AT

01:40:50.844 --> 01:40:52.513
RISK OF SOME OF THOSE.

01:40:52.579 --> 01:40:53.714
CHANNELS OF EXCEEDING OUR

01:40:53.781 --> 01:40:55.115
OBJECTIVES I JUST SAT THERE

01:40:55.182 --> 01:40:57.217
BRIEFINGS SERVE RISCO -- ON THE

01:40:57.284 --> 01:40:58.919
MERCED WITH A THAT BIOLOGIST DID

01:40:58.986 --> 01:41:04.925
SOME COMPUTER MODELING OF

01:41:04.992 --> 01:41:05.793
DIFFERENT CFS.

01:41:05.859 --> 01:41:07.795
NUMBERS AND WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK

01:41:07.861 --> 01:41:09.229
LIKE -- TO THE RIVER IN THE

01:41:09.296 --> 01:41:09.930
FLOOD PLAINS ROUNDED SOME SO FOR

01:41:09.997 --> 01:41:11.598
THE SHOULD YOU HAVE THE SAME

01:41:11.665 --> 01:41:11.999
CAPABILITY RIGHT.

01:41:12.065 --> 01:41:13.667
YEAH.

01:41:13.734 --> 01:41:15.135
THE QUESTION I'M STILL

01:41:15.202 --> 01:41:16.937
STRUGGLING WITH IS.

01:41:17.004 --> 01:41:18.105
AFTER SEVERAL DIFFERENT WAYS BUT

01:41:18.172 --> 01:41:19.573
IT'S HARD FOR ME TO CENTRALIZE

01:41:19.640 --> 01:41:22.109
AS A LAYPERSON HOW APPEAR THE

01:41:22.176 --> 01:41:23.444
SACRAMENTO WHERE YOU'VE GOT FOUR

01:41:23.510 --> 01:41:25.012
AND A HALF MILLION ACRE FEET OF

01:41:25.078 --> 01:41:26.747
STORAGE.

01:41:26.814 --> 01:41:30.017
AND WORST CASE SNOW MEL IS ONE

01:41:30.083 --> 01:41:31.919
POINT SEVEN MILLION ACRE FEET.

01:41:31.985 --> 01:41:35.022
THAT THE RISK.

01:41:35.088 --> 01:41:37.391
IS IT FAR LESS THAN DOWN HERE ON

01:41:37.458 --> 01:41:40.093
THE SAN JOAQUIN WHERE THE TOTAL

01:41:40.160 --> 01:41:42.629
STORAGE -- IS MAYBE A HALF A

01:41:42.696 --> 01:41:43.931
MILLION ACRE FEET.

01:41:43.997 --> 01:41:46.099
AND THE WORST CASE SNOWMELT IS

01:41:46.166 --> 01:41:48.001
THREE TIMES THAT.

01:41:48.068 --> 01:41:49.436
SO I HAVE A HARD TO UNDERSTAND

01:41:49.503 --> 01:41:50.671
HOW THAT RESERVOIR.

01:41:50.737 --> 01:41:52.272
HAS THE SECOND YOU KNOW IS IT AT

01:41:52.339 --> 01:41:54.107
GREATER RISK IN THAT REGION

01:41:54.174 --> 01:41:55.309
ISN'T AT GREATER RISK FOR

01:41:55.375 --> 01:41:56.477
FLOODING A WORST CASE SCENARIO

01:41:56.543 --> 01:41:57.511
THAN THE SACRAMENTO.

01:41:57.578 --> 01:41:59.379
AND UNDERSTAND THE DISTANCE

01:41:59.446 --> 01:42:01.281
BETWEEN -- I MEAN THERE'S A LOT

01:42:01.348 --> 01:42:02.716
OF FACTORS I GET THAT BUT IT

01:42:02.783 --> 01:42:04.451
SEEMS VERY OBVIOUS RIGHT UP

01:42:04.518 --> 01:42:05.719
FRONT THAT THAT WOULD BE THE

01:42:05.786 --> 01:42:08.255
GREATEST RISK AND IT AM I MISS

01:42:08.322 --> 01:42:10.290
INTERPRETING THE FACTS HERE.

01:42:10.357 --> 01:42:12.059
WELL.

01:42:12.125 --> 01:42:13.727
WHAT I?

01:42:13.794 --> 01:42:15.963
I THINK IT'S A IT'S THE TERM THE

01:42:16.029 --> 01:42:17.364
TERM REST WHAT RISK IS IS A

01:42:17.431 --> 01:42:18.398
LIKELIHOOD OF FLOODING.

01:42:18.465 --> 01:42:18.899
TIMES THE CONSEQUENCE OF

01:42:18.966 --> 01:42:20.801
FLOODING.

01:42:20.868 --> 01:42:22.669
SO ON THE ON THE LIKE YOU

01:42:22.736 --> 01:42:23.270
MENTIONED ON THE SACRAMENTO

01:42:23.337 --> 01:42:25.038
SYSTEM OF THE LIKELIHOOD OF

01:42:25.105 --> 01:42:25.939
FLOODING THERE BASED ON THE

01:42:26.006 --> 01:42:27.107
SENATE IS VERY SMALL.

01:42:27.174 --> 01:42:27.641
BUT THERE'S A LOT OF OUR

01:42:27.708 --> 01:42:28.809
POPULATIONS ARE SO THE

01:42:28.876 --> 01:42:31.445
CONSEQUENCES ARE ENORMOUSLY HIGH.

01:42:31.512 --> 01:42:32.880
ON THE SAN JOAQUIN SYSTEM AND

01:42:32.946 --> 01:42:34.014
MAYBE THE OTHER PARTS ON THIS ON

01:42:34.081 --> 01:42:35.549
THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER SYSTEM

01:42:35.616 --> 01:42:36.149
THAT WE'RE YOU'RE DRAWING OUR

01:42:36.216 --> 01:42:37.251
ATTENTION.

01:42:37.317 --> 01:42:39.686
TO THE LIKELIHOOD OF FLOODING IS

01:42:39.753 --> 01:42:40.721
HIGHER.

01:42:40.787 --> 01:42:41.755
BUT THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE FAT

01:42:41.822 --> 01:42:44.491
FLOODING WOULD BE LOWER AND SO

01:42:44.558 --> 01:42:45.559
THAT'S WHY I STOPPED TAKING A

01:42:45.626 --> 01:42:46.827
TOUGH ANSWER WHEN YOU WHEN YOU

01:42:46.894 --> 01:42:47.461
WITH WHEN YOU USE THE TERM RISK

01:42:47.528 --> 01:42:48.061
NO THAT'S VERY HELPFUL BECAUSE

01:42:48.128 --> 01:42:49.062
NOW WE CAN.

01:42:49.129 --> 01:42:50.597
WE CAN BY FOR KATE RESCUED TWO

01:42:50.664 --> 01:42:54.935
CATEGORIES NOT A LIKELIHOOD SIDE.

01:42:55.002 --> 01:42:55.502
THEN WE COULD SAY WITH SOME

01:42:55.569 --> 01:42:56.570
CERTAINTY THAT SAM OUR KIDS IN

01:42:56.637 --> 01:42:56.837
THE WORST.

01:42:56.904 --> 01:42:58.438
POSITION.

01:42:58.505 --> 01:43:01.341
THERE'S DEFINITELY A CONCERN

01:43:01.408 --> 01:43:02.743
THERE -- I WANT TO THE LIMIT

01:43:02.809 --> 01:43:04.378
LIVING DRILL DOWN A LITTLE

01:43:04.444 --> 01:43:07.481
FURTHER FOR YOU -- IN ORDER TO

01:43:07.548 --> 01:43:09.516
MITIGATE FOR THAT POTENTIAL

01:43:09.583 --> 01:43:11.585
FLOODING WITH AFTER.

01:43:11.652 --> 01:43:12.986
RELEASED A WHOLE LOT OF WATER

01:43:13.053 --> 01:43:14.621
THROUGH THAT RESERVOIR RIGHT SO

01:43:14.688 --> 01:43:16.690
WERE WE WARMING UP COMPLEMENT

01:43:16.757 --> 01:43:17.925
WAS DISCUSSION ABOUT WATER

01:43:17.991 --> 01:43:20.561
SUPPLYAND MISSED OPPORTUNITIES

01:43:20.627 --> 01:43:22.129
FOR WATER SUPPLY AND SECURITY AS

01:43:22.195 --> 01:43:23.797
WE LOOK AT EXTENDED DROUGHTS AND

01:43:23.864 --> 01:43:25.332
WHICH IS ONE OF THE TOPICS --

01:43:25.399 --> 01:43:26.900
REBECCA COR PORTION OF THE TOPIC

01:43:26.967 --> 01:43:28.135
HERE TODAY.

01:43:28.201 --> 01:43:29.937
IT SEEMS LIKE THAT'S A HUGE

01:43:30.003 --> 01:43:32.105
MISSED OPPORTUNITY RIVER IN THE

01:43:32.172 --> 01:43:33.807
SENSE THAT THAT'S A WHOLE LOT OF

01:43:33.874 --> 01:43:36.043
WATER WOULD BE -- NOT STORING

01:43:36.109 --> 01:43:39.079
FOR THE FUTURE IN THE CASE OF A

01:43:39.146 --> 01:43:41.181
YOU KNOW HOT FEW HOT WEEKS OR

01:43:41.248 --> 01:43:42.916
HOT MONTH SET FAIR TO SAY.

01:43:42.983 --> 01:43:45.519
YES -- BUT I WANTED TO GO AND DO

01:43:45.586 --> 01:43:47.654
A LITTLE COMPARISON HERE BETWEEN --

01:43:47.721 --> 01:43:49.222
SHASTA WHICH IS THE LARGEST OF

01:43:49.289 --> 01:43:51.558
OUR RESERVOIRS AND BACK -- TO

01:43:51.625 --> 01:43:52.559
MILLER TENANTS AND CAN RIVER

01:43:52.626 --> 01:43:53.594
THERE WHICH I THINK IS WHAT

01:43:53.660 --> 01:43:55.629
WE'RE TALKING -- THIS THE

01:43:55.696 --> 01:43:57.264
ORIGINAL SIZE IS DESIGNED BY

01:43:57.331 --> 01:43:59.366
THOSE TO RESERVOIRS YOU CAN SEE

01:43:59.433 --> 01:44:01.168
THAT THERE'S THE FOUR POINT FIVE

01:44:01.234 --> 01:44:02.669
IT SHASTA THOUSAND ACRE FEET.

01:44:02.736 --> 01:44:03.971
OR FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION ACRE

01:44:04.037 --> 01:44:05.305
FEET SORRY AND THEN YOU HAVE A

01:44:05.372 --> 01:44:06.406
BASICALLY EFFECTIVELY A HALF

01:44:06.473 --> 01:44:08.208
MILLION ACRE FEET AS THE ACT OF

01:44:08.275 --> 01:44:10.410
STORAGE BOWL WITH NORTON MIKE.

01:44:10.477 --> 01:44:12.346
AND AT THE PARTY ORIGINAL DESIGN

01:44:12.412 --> 01:44:17.784
FOR THOSE TWO WATER SHEDS WE

01:44:17.851 --> 01:44:19.019
WERE ALWAYS.

01:44:19.086 --> 01:44:19.553
KNOWING THAT WE WOULD BE

01:44:19.620 --> 01:44:20.721
REFILLING A MILLER TEN AGAIN AND

01:44:20.787 --> 01:44:21.388
AGAIN AND AGAIN AS THE SNOW MELT

01:44:21.455 --> 01:44:23.090
BETWEEN APRIL AND JULY WOULD

01:44:23.156 --> 01:44:24.691
SLOWLY UP HER OUT THERE.

01:44:24.758 --> 01:44:25.993
SO THERE HISTORICALLY HAS BEEN A

01:44:26.059 --> 01:44:28.528
METERING OF THAT SNOW PACK TO

01:44:28.595 --> 01:44:30.764
FILL THAT -- IN I THINK THE THE

01:44:30.831 --> 01:44:32.699
QUESTION AT HAND IS WINNER THE

01:44:32.766 --> 01:44:35.202
RULES GONNA CHANGE AND WHEN WILL

01:44:35.268 --> 01:44:37.137
WE SEE FASTER SNOW MELT INTO

01:44:37.204 --> 01:44:40.073
THAT AREA ANY TO LOOK INTO THAT --

01:44:40.140 --> 01:44:42.442
THE GOOD NEWS IS IT DOES TAKE

01:44:42.509 --> 01:44:45.312
AWHILE FOR THAT TO OCCUR --

01:44:45.379 --> 01:44:46.947
MEANING LIKE DECADES WHEN WE GET

01:44:47.014 --> 01:44:49.349
INTO THAT DEGREE OF CLIMATE

01:44:49.416 --> 01:44:51.618
CHANGE AND WHEN WE WENT AND DID

01:44:51.685 --> 01:44:52.986
THE CENTER FIVE FOOT PROTECTION

01:44:53.053 --> 01:44:54.554
PLAN WE DID DO CLIMATE CHANGE

01:44:54.621 --> 01:44:56.189
ASSESSMENTS I TALKED ABOUT.

01:44:56.256 --> 01:44:58.058
HOW PARADISE CUT WE SIZED SO WE

01:44:58.125 --> 01:44:59.526
LOOK DOWNSTREAM WITHOUT WATER

01:44:59.593 --> 01:45:01.061
WAS GOING ACTUALLY DESIGNED THE

01:45:01.128 --> 01:45:02.829
CHANNEL TO BE BROAD ENOUGH TO

01:45:02.896 --> 01:45:04.131
ACCOMMODATE SOME OF THAT WATER

01:45:04.197 --> 01:45:07.567
AS IT MOVES THROUGH AN IMPROVED

01:45:07.634 --> 01:45:09.803
SEVENTEEN RIVER SYSTEM -- BUT WE

01:45:09.870 --> 01:45:10.404
HAD OTHER AREAS WHERE WE HAD

01:45:10.470 --> 01:45:11.938
TRANSITORY STORAGE AREAS WHERE

01:45:12.005 --> 01:45:13.640
WATER CAN GET INTO THESE MULTI

01:45:13.707 --> 01:45:15.942
BENEFIT REFUGES ABOVE THAT AREA

01:45:16.009 --> 01:45:18.045
AS WELL AND WE DID -- PLAY

01:45:18.111 --> 01:45:19.279
AROUND WITH SOME RESERVOIR RE

01:45:19.346 --> 01:45:20.714
OPERATIONS WHICH WOULD BE LIKE

01:45:20.781 --> 01:45:23.417
REDEFINING THAT YELLOW SPACE IN

01:45:23.483 --> 01:45:25.919
BLUE SPACE WITHIN MILLER TEN SO

01:45:25.986 --> 01:45:26.987
THAT WE HAD SOME FLEXIBILITY IN

01:45:27.054 --> 01:45:27.654
THERE.

01:45:27.721 --> 01:45:28.789
AND WE WERE ABLE TO DO IT IN A

01:45:28.855 --> 01:45:29.923
PLANNING CONSTRUCT AS THIS IS

01:45:29.990 --> 01:45:31.758
TALKING ABOUT PLANNING FOR AN

01:45:31.825 --> 01:45:32.392
AREA THE SIZE OF THE STATE OF

01:45:32.459 --> 01:45:33.026
FLORIDA.

01:45:33.093 --> 01:45:34.094
SO WE HAD TO MAKE SOME

01:45:34.161 --> 01:45:37.130
ASSUMPTIONS AND THEN THE WAY

01:45:37.197 --> 01:45:38.665
THAT WE WOULD THEN MOVE IT IS.

01:45:38.732 --> 01:45:40.467
TEAR OFF OF THOSE PLANS TO GET

01:45:40.534 --> 01:45:42.502
TO MORE REAL FEASIBILITY STUDIES

01:45:42.569 --> 01:45:44.371
ABOUT IS IS SOMETHING THAT

01:45:44.438 --> 01:45:45.939
REALLY WOULD WORK OR NOT.

01:45:46.006 --> 01:45:47.207
KNOWING THAT SURVIVED THE

01:45:47.274 --> 01:45:48.842
PROTECTION PLAN BY LAWS TO BE

01:45:48.909 --> 01:45:50.711
UPDATED EVERY FIVE YEARS SO AS

01:45:50.777 --> 01:45:52.245
WE DO OTHER ACTIONS AND HAVE

01:45:52.312 --> 01:45:53.814
OTHER CONVERSATIONS WITH OTHERS.

01:45:53.880 --> 01:45:55.315
THAT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THEN

01:45:55.382 --> 01:45:59.486
BECOMES THE NEW BASELINE WITHIN

01:45:59.553 --> 01:46:01.321
OUR SYSTEM CONTEXT PLANNING

01:46:01.388 --> 01:46:01.621
[inaudible]

01:46:01.688 --> 01:46:04.091
THIS BIGELOW.

01:46:04.157 --> 01:46:05.992
AS A CANDIDATE JUST TO LISTEN

01:46:06.059 --> 01:46:08.895
AND BE ON THE BALCONY AND AND

01:46:08.962 --> 01:46:09.496
JUST TRY TO LEARN A LITTLE BIT

01:46:09.563 --> 01:46:10.931
MORE.

01:46:10.997 --> 01:46:11.565
BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT YOU

01:46:11.631 --> 01:46:13.100
KNOW.

01:46:13.166 --> 01:46:13.667
AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU

01:46:13.734 --> 01:46:16.870
DON'T KNOW -- FOR MISTER COOLEY

01:46:16.937 --> 01:46:18.505
THERE IS A A GREAT DEAL

01:46:18.572 --> 01:46:19.139
COORDINATION IN THE SAN JOAQUIN

01:46:19.206 --> 01:46:19.940
RIVER.

01:46:20.006 --> 01:46:21.908
AND ALONG THE THE WAY MOST OF

01:46:21.975 --> 01:46:24.745
THESE RIVERS HAVE A COORDINATED

01:46:24.811 --> 01:46:26.813
EFFORT SO THEY DON'T WIND UP

01:46:26.880 --> 01:46:27.547
WITH THE OCCURRENCE THAT YOU

01:46:27.614 --> 01:46:28.548
WERE.

01:46:28.615 --> 01:46:30.417
SPEAKING TO WHICH IS.

01:46:30.484 --> 01:46:31.651
I'M A CUMULATIVE IMPACT THAT

01:46:31.718 --> 01:46:32.686
WOULD HIT THE RIVER THAT WOULD

01:46:32.753 --> 01:46:34.421
CAUSE A MAJOR FLOOD TO THE

01:46:34.488 --> 01:46:37.290
COMMUNITIES DOWN FLOW.

01:46:37.357 --> 01:46:39.192
AND AS WE RECOGNIZE EACH OF

01:46:39.259 --> 01:46:41.461
THESE HAVE EIGHT BY THE BY THE

01:46:41.528 --> 01:46:43.063
GRAPH THAT WE SEE UP HERE ON

01:46:43.130 --> 01:46:43.697
THIS CHART IN OUR CHARTS ON HER

01:46:43.764 --> 01:46:44.731
DESK.

01:46:44.798 --> 01:46:46.133
WE SEE THAT THERE'S MORE

01:46:46.199 --> 01:46:47.901
CAPABILITY FOR TIME OF

01:46:47.968 --> 01:46:49.436
DISPLACEMENT THE TERM IS NOT

01:46:49.503 --> 01:46:51.505
REGULARLY USED OR HEARD BY THIS

01:46:51.571 --> 01:46:52.339
BODY.

01:46:52.405 --> 01:46:53.840
TIME A DISPLACEMENT IS A

01:46:53.907 --> 01:46:55.742
CRITICAL COMPONENT FOR US TO

01:46:55.809 --> 01:46:57.811
HAVE SUCCESS IN OUR COMMUNITIES

01:46:57.878 --> 01:46:59.513
AND WATER STATE.

01:46:59.579 --> 01:47:02.149
NOW WE JUST.

01:47:02.215 --> 01:47:03.850
WE WERE JUST LISTENING.

01:47:03.917 --> 01:47:05.285
TO WHAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT

01:47:05.352 --> 01:47:06.787
YOU NEED DECADES. TO REALLY

01:47:06.853 --> 01:47:08.955
STUDY.

01:47:09.022 --> 01:47:10.657
TALK TO US ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED

01:47:10.724 --> 01:47:12.526
IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN AND THE

01:47:12.592 --> 01:47:14.761
SUBSEQUENT YEARS UP.

01:47:14.828 --> 01:47:15.362
TO TWO THOUSAND FIVE TELL US

01:47:15.428 --> 01:47:17.564
ABOUT WHAT MAJOR CATASTROPHIC

01:47:17.631 --> 01:47:19.332
EVENT OCCURRED.

01:47:19.399 --> 01:47:21.535
ON THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER.

01:47:21.601 --> 01:47:24.137
THAT WE KNOW CAN HAPPEN AND WILL

01:47:24.204 --> 01:47:26.573
HAPPEN AGAIN AND AGAIN IF WE

01:47:26.640 --> 01:47:29.176
DON'T CHANGE THE SKEW OF TIME A

01:47:29.242 --> 01:47:30.811
DISPLACEMENT BY HAVING.

01:47:30.877 --> 01:47:33.380
A QUANTITATIVE CHANGE IN STORAGE

01:47:33.446 --> 01:47:35.148
CAPACITY.

01:47:35.215 --> 01:47:37.484
SO THE NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN

01:47:37.551 --> 01:47:39.152
FLOOD WAS A WIDESPREAD FLOOD OF

01:47:39.219 --> 01:47:40.587
AND FOR BOTH SACRAMENTO SAN

01:47:40.654 --> 01:47:42.722
JOAQUIN VALLEY SISTER WHERE --

01:47:42.789 --> 01:47:44.291
BUT THAT WAS AN EVENT THAT

01:47:44.357 --> 01:47:45.692
OCCURRED BEFORE WE HAD THE

01:47:45.759 --> 01:47:47.394
FORECAST WHEN IT OPERATIONS

01:47:47.460 --> 01:47:49.162
PROGRAM THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING

01:47:49.229 --> 01:47:50.397
ABOUT HERE SO NOT TRUE.

01:47:50.463 --> 01:47:52.265
THAT WAS BUILT INTO THE FEDERAL

01:47:52.332 --> 01:47:53.834
REGULATION AND AND THEY MISTER

01:47:53.900 --> 01:47:55.502
TONY WAS RUNNING THAT SO KEEP

01:47:55.569 --> 01:47:57.838
GOING I'M GONNA I'M GONNA

01:47:57.904 --> 01:47:59.539
CHALLENGE ON THIS ONE OKAY.

01:47:59.606 --> 01:48:00.440
I WELCOME IS THERE YEAH I WAS

01:48:00.507 --> 01:48:02.375
THE GUY THEY'RE HAVING TO MAKE

01:48:02.442 --> 01:48:04.377
THE CALLS -- PRE BEING ABORTED

01:48:04.444 --> 01:48:06.613
SUPERVISOR AS A LANDMARK.

01:48:06.680 --> 01:48:09.316
I WASN'T AFFECTED PARTY --

01:48:09.382 --> 01:48:12.252
MOVING INTO -- THE MORE RECENT

01:48:12.319 --> 01:48:13.153
THOUGHT OF AS WE HAD SO THINKING

01:48:13.220 --> 01:48:15.622
ABOUT THE WATER THAT HAPPEN IN

01:48:15.689 --> 01:48:16.323
TWENTY SEVENTEEN THERE WERE

01:48:16.389 --> 01:48:17.824
COORDINATION CALLS THE JOHNS

01:48:17.891 --> 01:48:19.392
TEAM WAS WORKING WITH THE

01:48:19.459 --> 01:48:20.961
RESERVOIR OPERATORS WITH THE

01:48:21.027 --> 01:48:22.562
DOWNSTREAM COMMUNITIES. TO

01:48:22.629 --> 01:48:24.164
LITERALLY GO THROUGH AND DO

01:48:24.231 --> 01:48:25.799
EXACTLY DESCRIBED EARLIER WAS TO

01:48:25.866 --> 01:48:28.034
ENSURE THAT BASICALLY WE COULD.

01:48:28.101 --> 01:48:30.704
MEET HER OUT THE WATER ACCOUNT

01:48:30.770 --> 01:48:32.539
FOR THE ATTENUATION TIME THIS

01:48:32.606 --> 01:48:33.907
DISPLACEMENT TIME AS YOU CALL IT.

01:48:33.974 --> 01:48:36.176
AND MAKE SURE THAT WE WOULD NOT

01:48:36.243 --> 01:48:37.611
BE EXCEEDING THE DOWNSTREAM

01:48:37.677 --> 01:48:40.046
CAPACITIES PARALLEL TO THAT --

01:48:40.113 --> 01:48:41.548
THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES WERE GOING

01:48:41.615 --> 01:48:43.083
THROUGH AND WHERE THEY NEEDED

01:48:43.149 --> 01:48:44.851
WERE AN ACTING EMERGENCY

01:48:44.918 --> 01:48:46.686
MEASURES ON THEIR LEVEES TO YOU

01:48:46.753 --> 01:48:48.188
KNOW BASICALLY WHERE THERE'S

01:48:48.255 --> 01:48:49.756
KNOWN LOW SPOTS ON THE LEVEES.

01:48:49.823 --> 01:48:51.591
GO THROUGH PROVIDE BASICALLY

01:48:51.658 --> 01:48:52.893
SOME ADDITIONAL BERMS OR

01:48:52.959 --> 01:48:57.530
SANDBAGS TO ADDRESS AND STRENGTH

01:48:57.597 --> 01:48:58.098
IN THAT SYSTEM IN THOSE WEAK

01:48:58.164 --> 01:48:58.865
POINTS.

01:48:58.932 --> 01:48:59.332
SO.

01:48:59.399 --> 01:49:00.800
WHAT OCCURRED IN NINETY SEVEN

01:49:00.867 --> 01:49:02.903
WAS ONE OF THE GREAT?

01:49:02.969 --> 01:49:04.304
INJUSTICES.

01:49:04.371 --> 01:49:05.505
BUT IT'S ALSO SOMETHING THAT

01:49:05.572 --> 01:49:08.241
POINTS OUT OUR FAILURES -- TO

01:49:08.308 --> 01:49:09.843
PREPARE.

01:49:09.910 --> 01:49:10.410
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT WHAT'S

01:49:10.477 --> 01:49:11.645
HAPPENING ON?

01:49:11.711 --> 01:49:14.080
A PAGE FIVE YOU SPOKE TO ALL OF

01:49:14.147 --> 01:49:15.582
THE IMPROVEMENTS AND THE FIVE

01:49:15.649 --> 01:49:18.051
BILLION DOLLARS BUT IF WE TAKE A

01:49:18.118 --> 01:49:18.952
LOOK VERY LITTLE MONEY IS

01:49:19.019 --> 01:49:20.687
MISSING ON THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER

01:49:20.754 --> 01:49:21.655
IT'S ALL BEEN SPENT.

01:49:21.721 --> 01:49:24.424
IN THE SACRAMENTO REGIONAL AREA --

01:49:24.491 --> 01:49:26.192
FOR IMPROVEMENTS THEIR

01:49:26.259 --> 01:49:27.827
RECOGNIZING THAT THE CHURCHILL A

01:49:27.894 --> 01:49:29.930
BY PASS HAS HOLES RIDDLED

01:49:29.996 --> 01:49:31.431
THROUGH IT AND ANY MAJOR.

01:49:31.498 --> 01:49:33.033
ADDITIONAL FLOOD THAT WOULD

01:49:33.099 --> 01:49:34.334
OCCUR THERE IS GOING TO HAVE A

01:49:34.401 --> 01:49:35.402
BLOW OUT THAT'S GOING TO WIPE

01:49:35.468 --> 01:49:37.170
OUT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE

01:49:37.237 --> 01:49:39.706
IF NOT MORE -- WITH IT WITHOUT

01:49:39.773 --> 01:49:44.744
ANY HARDLY ANY NOTICE AT ALL.

01:49:44.811 --> 01:49:45.345
LET'S RECOGNIZE MISSED COOLEY

01:49:45.412 --> 01:49:46.913
JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE PART OF THIS

01:49:46.980 --> 01:49:49.716
TRIVIA -- THAT FLOOD.

01:49:49.783 --> 01:49:51.284
THAT OCCURRED HAD OVER SIXTY

01:49:51.351 --> 01:49:51.885
SEVEN THOUSAND CUBIC FEET PER

01:49:51.952 --> 01:49:55.288
SECOND THE DESIGN CAPACITY IS AT

01:49:55.355 --> 01:49:55.922
TWENTY SIX ONLY TO GET TO THE

01:49:55.989 --> 01:49:56.923
SACK DAM.

01:49:56.990 --> 01:49:58.391
THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER TODAY CAN

01:49:58.458 --> 01:50:00.026
ONLY HANDLE EIGHT THOUSAND CUBIC

01:50:00.093 --> 01:50:01.027
FEET PER SECOND.

01:50:01.094 --> 01:50:03.897
YOU CAN ONLY PUT A LITTLE OVER

01:50:03.964 --> 01:50:04.497
NINE THOUSAND CUBIC FEET PER

01:50:04.564 --> 01:50:06.666
SECOND AND THE BY PASS THOSE

01:50:06.733 --> 01:50:08.335
DON'T EQUAL.

01:50:08.401 --> 01:50:08.969
TWENTY SIX WHAT HAPPENS TO THE

01:50:09.035 --> 01:50:12.472
DIFFERENCE IT GOES AND IT

01:50:12.539 --> 01:50:13.640
SPREADS WILDLY

01:50:13.707 --> 01:50:15.375
IF YOU LOOK AT THIS ROOM MOST OF

01:50:15.442 --> 01:50:17.811
US HAVE DRIVEN ONE FIFTY TWO WE

01:50:17.877 --> 01:50:19.245
KNOW ONE FIFTY TWO HAS THE SAN

01:50:19.312 --> 01:50:19.846
JOAQUIN RIVER BECAUSE WE CROSS

01:50:19.913 --> 01:50:20.814
IT.

01:50:20.880 --> 01:50:22.549
HOW FAR DO WE SEE ACROSS TO

01:50:22.615 --> 01:50:24.651
ABOUT THE WITH OF THIS ROOM?

01:50:24.718 --> 01:50:26.619
IT'S ACTUALLY ELEVEN MILES WIDE.

01:50:26.686 --> 01:50:28.855
BUT WE NEVER SEE IT FLOODED.

01:50:28.922 --> 01:50:30.023
BECAUSE WE'VE DONE A GOOD JOB A

01:50:30.090 --> 01:50:31.458
MASTERING IN HARNESSING THE

01:50:31.524 --> 01:50:32.192
RESOURCE.

01:50:32.258 --> 01:50:34.527
THAT EXIST.

01:50:34.594 --> 01:50:36.696
BUT MR GRAY IS HEATING UP

01:50:36.763 --> 01:50:38.565
FABULOUS POINT HERE.

01:50:38.631 --> 01:50:40.467
THE LARGEST SNOW PACK.

01:50:40.533 --> 01:50:42.435
THE GREATEST POTENTIAL FOR US TO

01:50:42.502 --> 01:50:44.137
HAVE A GAME IS ON THE SAN

01:50:44.204 --> 01:50:45.472
JOAQUIN RIVER FOR FLOOD

01:50:45.538 --> 01:50:48.074
PROTECTION AND UTILIZATION.

01:50:48.141 --> 01:50:49.876
YET WORK STUMBLING OVER

01:50:49.943 --> 01:50:51.611
RECOGNIZING IT.

01:50:51.678 --> 01:50:52.979
AND ADDRESSING IT.

01:50:53.046 --> 01:50:56.316
WHY IS THAT NOT OCCURRING?

01:50:56.383 --> 01:50:58.852
IN A MORE HASTILY WAY.

01:50:58.918 --> 01:51:00.020
BECAUSE JUST AS WE WERE WORRIED

01:51:00.086 --> 01:51:00.887
ABOUT WAR BILL.

01:51:00.954 --> 01:51:02.689
WITH ITS FLOOD.

01:51:02.756 --> 01:51:04.557
WHEN IT WAS OCCURRING?

01:51:04.624 --> 01:51:05.658
WE WE DIDN'T THREATEN THE SAN

01:51:05.725 --> 01:51:08.495
JOAQUIN RIVER WE NEED TO GET IT

01:51:08.561 --> 01:51:10.163
TAKEN CARE OF NOW.

01:51:10.230 --> 01:51:12.732
WE CAN'T WAIT ANY LONGER.

01:51:12.799 --> 01:51:14.134
BECAUSE THOSE PEOPLE.

01:51:14.200 --> 01:51:16.302
HAVE GROWN IN MASSES AND TO SAY

01:51:16.369 --> 01:51:18.038
THAT ONE COMMUNITY.

01:51:18.104 --> 01:51:19.706
AND ONE GROUP OF PEOPLE IS OF

01:51:19.773 --> 01:51:21.541
MORE VALUE THAN ANOTHER.

01:51:21.608 --> 01:51:22.642
KIND OF GETS TO THE SOMEONE'S

01:51:22.709 --> 01:51:27.847
CROSS.

01:51:27.914 --> 01:51:29.983
HOW CAN YOU RESPOND TO THAT?

01:51:30.050 --> 01:51:30.984
OR DO YOU WANT TO KNOW HAVE

01:51:31.051 --> 01:51:32.018
DON'T HAVE RESPONSE THAT I

01:51:32.085 --> 01:51:33.987
DIDN'T THINK SO.

01:51:34.054 --> 01:51:35.188
WE'LL KEEP GOING WE'LL HAVE MORE

TALKING ABOUT -- THAT DEPARTMENT

01:53:29.836 --> 01:53:31.571
SHOWED YOU A LOT OF THEIR GREAT

01:53:31.638 --> 01:53:33.573
TOOLS THAT THEY HAVE BOTH FOR

01:53:33.640 --> 01:53:34.974
GATHERING DATA AND FOR

01:53:35.041 --> 01:53:36.843
SUPPORTING DECISIONS I'M GONNA

01:53:36.910 --> 01:53:38.578
TALK TO A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW

01:53:38.645 --> 01:53:41.080
WE ORGANIZE THE THE VENUES AND

01:53:41.147 --> 01:53:43.816
HOW WE CREATE THE POLICY THAT

01:53:43.883 --> 01:53:49.222
GOES ALONG WITH THAT.

01:53:49.289 --> 01:53:51.658
THE STATE'S STRATEGIC VISION FOR

01:53:51.724 --> 01:53:53.159
REDUCING FLOOD RISK IN THE

01:53:53.226 --> 01:53:55.762
CENTRAL VALLEY HAS A LOT OF AND

01:53:55.828 --> 01:53:58.031
HAS HAD A LOT OF INPUT FROM THE

01:53:58.097 --> 01:54:00.133
LOCALS WHICH WE VERY MUCH

01:54:00.200 --> 01:54:01.334
APPRECIATE.

01:54:01.401 --> 01:54:03.169
WE'VE BEEN AT THIS FOR FOR QUITE

01:54:03.236 --> 01:54:06.105
AWHILE AND I KNOW WE TALK ABOUT

01:54:06.172 --> 01:54:06.706
NINETEEN FIFTY AS KIND OF A

01:54:06.773 --> 01:54:08.208
STARTING POINT AROUND THE

01:54:08.274 --> 01:54:09.509
FIFTIES WHEN THE FEDERAL

01:54:09.576 --> 01:54:11.110
GOVERNMENT GOT INVOLVED.

01:54:11.177 --> 01:54:12.812
BUT ACTUALLY THE CENTRAL VALLEY

01:54:12.879 --> 01:54:15.315
FLOOD PROTECTION BOARD IN ITS --

01:54:15.381 --> 01:54:16.616
PREVIOUS ITERATION AS THE

01:54:16.683 --> 01:54:18.484
RECLAMATION BOARD WAS ASKED TO

01:54:18.551 --> 01:54:19.819
STEP IN IN THE VERY EARLY

01:54:19.886 --> 01:54:21.721
TWENTIETH CENTURY TO HELP

01:54:21.788 --> 01:54:24.724
DEVELOP THE WHAT WE NOW KNOW AS

01:54:24.791 --> 01:54:26.593
THE STATE PLAN OF FLOOD CONTROL.

01:54:26.659 --> 01:54:28.461
SO WE'VE REALLY BEEN OUT THIS

01:54:28.528 --> 01:54:30.396
FOR OVER A HUNDRED YEARS -- WE

01:54:30.463 --> 01:54:32.532
DID HAVE A PLAN BACK THEN IN

01:54:32.599 --> 01:54:33.132
NINETEEN ELEVEN WHICH WAS THE

01:54:33.199 --> 01:54:35.068
JACKSON REPORT AND I THINK TO

01:54:35.134 --> 01:54:36.936
UNDERSTAND REALLY WHERE WHY WE

01:54:37.003 --> 01:54:38.204
HAVE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES WE

01:54:38.271 --> 01:54:39.806
HAVE NOW IT'S IMPORTANT TO

01:54:39.872 --> 01:54:41.341
UNDERSTAND WHY THAT.

01:54:41.407 --> 01:54:42.442
WHY THE SYSTEM CAME ABOUT THE

01:54:42.508 --> 01:54:44.077
WAY THAT IT DID WE TOUCHED ON

01:54:44.143 --> 01:54:45.578
THAT JUST A LITTLE BIT IN THE

01:54:45.645 --> 01:54:47.814
FIRST PANEL -- WHEN THE BOARD

01:54:47.880 --> 01:54:49.315
WITH ASKED TO STEP IN AND

01:54:49.382 --> 01:54:51.584
DEVELOP A PLAN? TO TAKE OVER THE

01:54:51.651 --> 01:54:53.920
LEADERSHIP OF THIS -- WHAT THE

01:54:53.987 --> 01:54:56.556
OBJECTIVE WAS AT THAT POINT WAS

01:54:56.623 --> 01:54:58.258
TO DEAL WITH -- THE SEASONAL

01:54:58.324 --> 01:55:00.727
RIVER RAIN FLOODING THAT WE HAD

01:55:00.793 --> 01:55:02.762
WHILE ALSO MAKING SURE THAT THE

01:55:02.829 --> 01:55:04.330
RIVERS WERE FLOWING FAST AND

01:55:04.397 --> 01:55:05.798
SWIFT TO GET RID OF THE MINING

01:55:05.865 --> 01:55:08.301
TAILINGS AND ALLOW FOR COMMERCE

01:55:08.368 --> 01:55:09.836
TO CONTINUE UP THE RIVERS.

01:55:09.902 --> 01:55:12.338
SO THAT'S WHY THIS BYPASS SYSTEM

01:55:12.405 --> 01:55:13.439
DEVELOPED AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE

01:55:13.506 --> 01:55:14.574
I CONTINUE TO HAVE THE

01:55:14.641 --> 01:55:16.743
CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE HERE

01:55:16.809 --> 01:55:20.380
TODAY.

01:55:20.446 --> 01:55:21.447
IF YOU JUST TURN AYE AYE HAS

01:55:21.514 --> 01:55:23.049
SENT A PACKET IF YOU TURN TO A

01:55:23.116 --> 01:55:25.151
KIND OF THE FIRST PAGE OF YOUR

01:55:25.218 --> 01:55:28.388
POCKET -- I I TOOK THIS FROM THE

01:55:28.454 --> 01:55:29.922
INVESTMENT STRATEGY HIGHLIGHTS

01:55:29.989 --> 01:55:31.190
FROM THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN PLAN

01:55:31.257 --> 01:55:32.792
BECAUSE IT REALLY HAS A GREAT

01:55:32.859 --> 01:55:34.560
GRAPHIC TO SHOW WHAT HAS CHANGED

01:55:34.627 --> 01:55:35.995
IN A HUNDRED YEARS YOU LOOK ON

01:55:36.062 --> 01:55:37.430
THE LEFT SIDE OF THE GRAPHIC.

01:55:37.497 --> 01:55:39.599
THAT'S WHERE WE WERE IN NINETEEN

01:55:39.666 --> 01:55:40.233
SEVENTEEN YOU LOOK ON THE RIGHT

01:55:40.300 --> 01:55:41.367
SIDE OF THE GRAPHIC AND THAT'S

01:55:41.434 --> 01:55:42.669
WHERE WE WERE WHEN WE ADOPTED

01:55:42.735 --> 01:55:44.203
THE MOST RECENT ITERATION OF THE

01:55:44.270 --> 01:55:46.372
PLAN IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN IF YOU

01:55:46.439 --> 01:55:47.640
JUST TAKE A FEW SECONDS IF YOU

01:55:47.707 --> 01:55:48.474
HAVE A CHANCE TO PRE THROUGH

01:55:48.541 --> 01:55:49.108
THAT IT.

01:55:49.175 --> 01:55:51.344
WILL REALLY GIVE YOU A GOOD

01:55:51.411 --> 01:55:55.214
SENSE OF WHERE WE ARE.

01:55:55.281 --> 01:55:56.749
ALTHOUGH THESE THINGS ARE VERY

01:55:56.816 --> 01:55:58.484
COMPLEX THE BOARD HAS RECOGNIZED

01:55:58.551 --> 01:55:59.619
THAT THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT

01:55:59.686 --> 01:56:01.487
OPPORTUNITIES TO REALIZE THE

01:56:01.554 --> 01:56:02.655
VISION FOR THE FUTURE OF THE

01:56:02.722 --> 01:56:04.090
VALLEY AS TO NOTED IN THE

01:56:04.157 --> 01:56:05.358
CENTRAL VALLEY FLOOD PROTECTION

01:56:05.425 --> 01:56:07.226
PLAN WHICH IS REALLY THE

01:56:07.293 --> 01:56:08.695
BLUEPRINT THAT WE ALL FOLLOW.

01:56:08.761 --> 01:56:10.963
AND I KNOW THAT CHAIR GARCIA WHO

01:56:11.030 --> 01:56:11.898
JUST HAD TO STEP OUT FOR A

01:56:11.964 --> 01:56:13.566
MOMENT IS -- EX OFFICIO ON OUR

01:56:13.633 --> 01:56:14.834
BOARD AND THIS IS HIS SECOND

01:56:14.901 --> 01:56:16.536
YEAR THAT HE'S BEEN DOING THAT

01:56:16.602 --> 01:56:17.870
SO I I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT

01:56:17.937 --> 01:56:19.505
THERE'S THE LEGISLATIVE

01:56:19.572 --> 01:56:22.041
INVOLVEMENT IN OUR BOARD -- THE

01:56:22.108 --> 01:56:23.376
SEVEN VOTING MEMBERS APPOINTED

01:56:23.443 --> 01:56:24.744
BY THE GOVERNOR AND CONFIRMED BY

01:56:24.811 --> 01:56:26.412
THE SENATE AND TO FOUR YEAR

01:56:26.479 --> 01:56:27.480
TERMS ARE REALLY THE ONES THAT

01:56:27.547 --> 01:56:29.015
DRIVE THE POLICY FOR THE BOARD

01:56:29.082 --> 01:56:30.049
AND SO.

01:56:30.116 --> 01:56:32.218
HAVING THAT INPUT -- FROM AND

01:56:32.285 --> 01:56:34.020
ABILITY FROM THE LEGISLATORS IN

01:56:34.087 --> 01:56:36.889
THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IS ALSO

01:56:36.956 --> 01:56:38.091
VERY HELPFUL FOR THE BOARD --

01:56:38.157 --> 01:56:39.359
THE PLAN THAT WE HAVE NOW WAS

01:56:39.425 --> 01:56:40.727
DEVELOPED WITH EXTENSIVE

01:56:40.793 --> 01:56:42.428
STAKEHOLDER INPUT AND I'VE GOT

01:56:42.495 --> 01:56:44.063
SOME LOCALS HERE THAT HOPEFULLY

01:56:44.130 --> 01:56:45.465
ARE GOING TO ATTACHED TO THAT

01:56:45.531 --> 01:56:47.667
AND TELL YOU HOW AND HOW THAT.

01:56:47.734 --> 01:56:49.802
MAKES THE PLANIMPLEMENTABLE IN

01:56:49.869 --> 01:56:50.703
AND THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE WITH

01:56:50.770 --> 01:56:51.437
SOME OF THE OTHER PLANNING

01:56:51.504 --> 01:56:52.739
EFFORTS THAT YOU MAY HAVE SEEN

01:56:52.805 --> 01:56:54.207
THROUGHOUT THE STATUS WE HAVE

01:56:54.273 --> 01:56:55.308
BROAD SUPPORT FOR THIS PLAN

01:56:55.375 --> 01:56:56.843
WHICH MEANS WE CAN ACTUALLY DO

01:56:56.909 --> 01:56:58.478
SOMETHING WITH IT AND THAT'S AND

01:56:58.544 --> 01:57:00.079
NOT SOMETHING THAT'S VERY

01:57:00.146 --> 01:57:00.546
IMPORTANT TO US THAT.

01:57:00.613 --> 01:57:03.015
THE BOARD.

01:57:03.082 --> 01:57:04.650
SO HOW ARE WE HANDLING THOSE

01:57:04.717 --> 01:57:06.052
OPPORTUNITIES THAT I MENTIONED

01:57:06.119 --> 01:57:06.686
I'M GONNA BREAK THAT DOWN JUST

01:57:06.753 --> 01:57:09.455
INTO THREE CATEGORIES WE HAVE --

01:57:09.522 --> 01:57:11.057
REGULATORY AND OVERSIGHT.

01:57:11.124 --> 01:57:12.725
WE HAVE OUR NON FEDERAL

01:57:12.792 --> 01:57:14.427
SPONSORING ASSURANCES ROLE AND

01:57:14.494 --> 01:57:16.095
THEN MUCH LIKE THIS COMMITTEE

01:57:16.162 --> 01:57:17.997
HERE WE HAVE -- DRIVING THE

01:57:18.064 --> 01:57:19.265
VISION IN PROVIDING THE VENUE

01:57:19.332 --> 01:57:21.167
WHERE THOSE EXCHANGE OF IDEAS

01:57:21.234 --> 01:57:23.669
CAN HAPPEN -- I THINK YOU'RE ALL

01:57:23.736 --> 01:57:24.570
FAMILIAR WITH THE GOVERNOR'S

01:57:24.637 --> 01:57:26.372
EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT WAS ISSUED

01:57:26.439 --> 01:57:28.674
LAST WEEK THAT REQUIRES THE

01:57:28.741 --> 01:57:30.309
STATE AGENCIES TO I THINK

01:57:30.376 --> 01:57:32.745
DIFFERENTLY AND ACT BOLDLY. TO

01:57:32.812 --> 01:57:34.280
DEVELOP A RESILIENT WATER

01:57:34.347 --> 01:57:36.716
PORTFOLIO IN THE FLOOD WORLD

01:57:36.783 --> 01:57:38.184
THAT SOMETHING WE'VE BEEN DOING

01:57:38.251 --> 01:57:39.786
BY NECESSITY FOR AT THE OVER A

01:57:39.852 --> 01:57:41.587
DECADE NOW -- AND I WANT TO

01:57:41.654 --> 01:57:43.389
SHARE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW

01:57:43.456 --> 01:57:45.024
WE'VE BEEN DOING THAT.

01:57:45.091 --> 01:57:46.592
THE BOARD UTILIZES ITS BROAD

01:57:46.659 --> 01:57:48.227
REGULATORY AUTHORITY OVER THE

01:57:48.294 --> 01:57:50.596
SYSTEM TO MANAGE AND OVERSEE

01:57:50.663 --> 01:57:51.631
MORE THAN A HUNDRED LOCAL

01:57:51.697 --> 01:57:53.399
ENTITIES WHICH INCLUDE

01:57:53.466 --> 01:57:54.934
RECLAMATION AND LEVY DISTRICTS

01:57:55.001 --> 01:57:57.003
COUNTIES AND EVEN OUR PARTNERS

01:57:57.069 --> 01:57:58.271
AT THE STATE WHEN THEY'RE AND

01:57:58.337 --> 01:57:59.405
MAINTAINING.

01:57:59.472 --> 01:58:01.340
MAINTENANCE AREAS THAT SECOND

01:58:01.407 --> 01:58:02.842
THIRD PAGE OF MY HAND OUT HAS

01:58:02.909 --> 01:58:04.644
THAT A GRAPHIC SHOWING ALL THOSE

01:58:04.710 --> 01:58:05.945
DIFFERENT RECLAMATION LEVY

01:58:06.012 --> 01:58:07.647
DISTRICTS AND JUST KIND OF SHOWS

01:58:07.713 --> 01:58:09.215
YOU I SPREAD OUT THROUGHOUT THE

01:58:09.282 --> 01:58:11.150
VALLEY ON BOTH THE SACRAMENTO IN

01:58:11.217 --> 01:58:12.185
THE SAN JOAQUIN.

01:58:12.251 --> 01:58:14.053
WE OVERSEE AND MANAGE ALL OF

01:58:14.120 --> 01:58:15.354
THOSE AND THEY IN TURN ARE

01:58:15.421 --> 01:58:18.825
OVERSEEING AND MANAGING THE

01:58:18.891 --> 01:58:21.093
ENTIRE SYSTEM.

01:58:21.160 --> 01:58:22.395
WHEN WE ADOPTED THE LATEST

01:58:22.462 --> 01:58:24.797
ITERATION OF THE PLAN IN TWENTY

01:58:24.864 --> 01:58:25.865
SEVENTEEN ARE PRESIDENT OF THE

01:58:25.932 --> 01:58:27.934
BOARD BILL ANCHOR STATED THAT

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:29.502
THE BOARD'S FOCUS WAS GOING TO

01:58:29.569 --> 01:58:31.103
BE ON TAKING CARE OF WHAT WE

01:58:31.170 --> 01:58:32.572
HAVE NOW?

01:58:32.638 --> 01:58:34.106
AND FINDING A WAY TO PAY FOR IT.

01:58:34.173 --> 01:58:35.374
SO IN THE ROLE OF TAKING CARE OF

01:58:35.441 --> 01:58:36.609
WHAT WE HAVE NOW SOME OF THE

01:58:36.676 --> 01:58:38.945
DISCUSSIONS WE'VE HAD SINCE

01:58:39.011 --> 01:58:39.579
TWENTY SEVENTEEN WITH OUR LOCAL

01:58:39.645 --> 01:58:40.847
PARTNERS HAVE BEEN THROUGH WHAT

01:58:40.913 --> 01:58:42.181
WE HAVE THAT THEN YOU CALLED THE

01:58:42.248 --> 01:58:43.349
COORDINATING COMMITTEE.

01:58:43.416 --> 01:58:45.451
AND WE REALLY DRILL DOWN AND A

01:58:45.518 --> 01:58:46.786
LOT OF DETAIL ABOUT WHAT

01:58:46.853 --> 01:58:48.154
OPERATIONSAND MAINTENANCE

01:58:48.221 --> 01:58:50.790
REALLY MEANS WHAT IS OPERATIONS

01:58:50.857 --> 01:58:51.858
AND MAINTENANCE THAT THE LOCALS

01:58:51.924 --> 01:58:53.493
ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR SINCE THE

01:58:53.559 --> 01:58:55.228
STATE TURN THAT OVER TO THEM.

01:58:55.294 --> 01:58:56.996
AND THEN WHAT REALLY DO WE NEED

01:58:57.063 --> 01:58:58.531
TO LOOK MORE HOLISTICALLY WITH

01:58:58.598 --> 01:58:59.999
ALL OF US TOGETHER ON WHAT WOULD

01:59:00.066 --> 01:59:01.567
BE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE OR WHAT

01:59:01.634 --> 01:59:02.735
WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WOULDN'T

01:59:02.802 --> 01:59:05.371
BE CONSIDERED -- SORT OF YOUR

01:59:05.438 --> 01:59:06.506
TYPICAL OPERATIONS AND

01:59:06.572 --> 01:59:07.507
MAINTENANCE AND REALLY TRYING TO

01:59:07.573 --> 01:59:09.008
SOLVE SOME OF THOSE COMPLEX

01:59:09.075 --> 01:59:09.976
PROBLEMS THAT SOMETHING WE

01:59:10.042 --> 01:59:11.444
WORKED ON LAST YEAR WHICH

01:59:11.511 --> 01:59:12.912
RESULTED IN THE ISSUANCE OF

01:59:12.979 --> 01:59:14.714
BOARD RESOLUTION TWENTY EIGHTEEN

01:59:14.780 --> 01:59:17.617
DASH OF SIX WHICH THAT STANDARDS

01:59:17.683 --> 01:59:18.317

01:59:18.384 --> 01:59:20.052
MAINTENANCE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT OUR

01:59:24.090 --> 01:59:25.691
MANUALS THAT WE AS THE STATE

SAID BACK IN THE NINETEEN

01:59:28.194 --> 01:59:29.729
FIFTIES THAT WE WERE GOING TO DO.

01:59:29.795 --> 01:59:31.430
AND THEN FINDING A WAY THAT WE

01:59:31.497 --> 01:59:32.765
COULD SANTA VISE AND ASSIST THE

01:59:32.832 --> 01:59:35.134
LOCAL AGENCIES IN TWO GETTING

01:59:35.201 --> 01:59:36.536
INTO COMPLIANCE WITH THE FEDERAL

PROGRAM.

01:59:38.838 --> 01:59:40.239
AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS OF

01:59:40.306 --> 01:59:41.874
IMPORTANCE TO THE STATE BECAUSE

01:59:41.941 --> 01:59:43.676
AS YOU'VE HEARD EARLIER -- THE

01:59:43.743 --> 01:59:45.778
STATE DOES HAVE LIABILITY FOR

01:59:45.845 --> 01:59:48.514
THE SYSTEM AND SO AS MUCH AS WE

01:59:48.581 --> 01:59:49.882
TRY TO LEVERAGE ALL OF THE

01:59:49.949 --> 01:59:51.817

NINE PROGRAM THAT WOULD PROVIDE

02:00:03.062 --> 02:00:04.564
1100% FEDERAL FUNDING FOR

02:00:04.630 --> 02:00:06.966
REPAIRS TO CATASTROPHIC FAILURES

02:00:07.033 --> 02:00:08.000
TO STATE PLAN A FLOOD CONTROL

02:00:08.067 --> 02:00:09.435
LEVEES AND SO.

02:00:09.502 --> 02:00:10.736
THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE

02:00:10.803 --> 02:00:12.138
HAVE THAT -- AND THAT'S

02:00:12.204 --> 02:00:13.105
SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN

02:00:13.172 --> 02:00:14.473
WORKING ON WITH THE LOCALS TO

02:00:14.540 --> 02:00:15.808
MAKE SURE THAT CAN HAPPEN AS

02:00:15.875 --> 02:00:18.311

FIFTEEN THOUSAND ENCROACHMENTS

02:00:27.219 --> 02:00:28.754
UPON THIS SYSTEM THAT STILL HAVE

02:00:28.821 --> 02:00:30.056
TO BE DEALT WITH THAT HAVE.

02:00:30.122 --> 02:00:34.026
CROPPED UP OVER A HUNDRED YEARS.

02:00:34.093 --> 02:00:35.161
WITH ALSO REALLY BEEN OUT THERE

02:00:35.227 --> 02:00:37.063
SHAKING THE TREES TRYING TO FIND

02:00:37.129 --> 02:00:40.800

02:00:48.641 --> 02:00:50.042
APPROPRIATION DOES NOT PROVIDE A

02:00:50.109 --> 02:00:52.645
SUSTAINABLE FUNDING. FOR ALL OF

02:00:52.712 --> 02:00:54.413
THE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE --

02:00:54.480 --> 02:00:56.882
THANKS AND IN LARGE PART TO THE

02:00:56.949 --> 02:00:58.284
ALLOCATION THAT WE RECEIVED IN

DRAINAGE DISTRICT WHICH BACK IN

02:01:10.396 --> 02:01:11.163
NINETEEN ELEVEN WAS SOMETHING

02:01:11.230 --> 02:01:12.732
THAT THE BOARD USED TO RAISE

02:01:12.798 --> 02:01:13.666
FUNDS.

02:01:13.733 --> 02:01:15.167
TO BUILD THE ORIGINAL SYSTEM AND

02:01:15.234 --> 02:01:16.569
TO MANAGE IT UP AND THREW UP

02:01:16.636 --> 02:01:18.471
THROUGH THE NINETEEN TWENTIES OF

02:01:18.537 --> 02:01:20.840
WE DID THAT SO -- WE APPRECIATED

02:01:20.906 --> 02:01:22.808

02:01:24.410 --> 02:01:27.947
WE'LL HAVE MORE ABOUT THAT IN

02:01:28.014 --> 02:01:29.348
THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS.

02:01:29.415 --> 02:01:30.783
THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN CENTRAL

02:01:30.850 --> 02:01:32.585
VALLEY FLOOD PROTECTION PLAN

02:01:32.652 --> 02:01:35.321
NOTED THAT -- WE REALLY ARE ONLY

02:01:35.388 --> 02:01:37.089
SPENDING AROUND THIRTY MILLION

02:01:37.156 --> 02:01:39.458
ANNUALLY ON ACTUAL OPERATIONS

02:01:39.525 --> 02:01:40.693
AND MAINTENANCE AND WE SHOULD BE

02:01:40.760 --> 02:01:42.061
SPENDING CLOSER TO A HUNDRED AND

02:01:42.128 --> 02:01:43.896
THIRTY MILLION SO WE'VE REALLY

02:01:43.963 --> 02:01:44.463
BEEN WORKING TO TRYING CLOSE

02:01:44.530 --> 02:01:45.998
THAT GAP.

02:01:46.065 --> 02:01:47.466
IN OUR NON FEDERAL SPONSOR ROLE

02:01:47.533 --> 02:01:49.135
THE BOARD HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE

02:01:49.201 --> 02:01:50.369
NON FEDERAL SPONSOR WITH THE

02:01:50.436 --> 02:01:51.671
ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS

02:01:51.737 --> 02:01:53.172
PARTNERING ON THESE LARGE SCALE

02:01:53.239 --> 02:01:54.840
SO SWITCHING OVER TO KIND OF THE

02:01:54.907 --> 02:01:56.308
LARGE SCALE PROJECTS IN.

02:01:56.375 --> 02:01:59.345
THE LAST DAM FOUR PAGES IN YOUR

02:01:59.412 --> 02:02:00.579
PACKET THAT I PROVIDED THAT

02:02:00.646 --> 02:02:03.349
THERE ARE THE FACT SHEETS.

02:02:03.416 --> 02:02:04.817
FOR THE FOR PROJECTS THAT ARE

02:02:04.884 --> 02:02:06.052
CURRENTLY ON GOING IN THE

02:02:06.118 --> 02:02:07.019
CENTRAL VALLEY THAT ARE BEING

02:02:07.086 --> 02:02:08.788
FUNDED BY THAT SPECIAL

02:02:08.854 --> 02:02:10.990
ALLOCATION SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING

02:02:11.057 --> 02:02:13.526
THAT WAS A PART OF THE TWENTY

02:02:13.592 --> 02:02:14.927
EIGHTEEN BUDGET -- FROM THE

02:02:14.994 --> 02:02:17.363
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SO THAT WAS

02:02:17.430 --> 02:02:20.533
IN RESPONSE -- TO REQUEST BY IF

02:02:20.599 --> 02:02:21.967
THEY ALREADY TEAMS THAT TELLING

02:02:22.034 --> 02:02:22.735
THE ARMY CORPS THEY'VE GOT TO

02:02:22.802 --> 02:02:24.270
MOVE DIRT TURNED OR GET THESE

02:02:24.336 --> 02:02:26.305
THINGS BELT SO WITH THIS FUNDING

02:02:26.372 --> 02:02:28.374
AND WITH THAT IMPETUS FROM THE

02:02:28.441 --> 02:02:29.709
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

02:02:29.775 --> 02:02:31.010
THE ARMY CORPS IS TRYING VERY

02:02:31.077 --> 02:02:32.645
HARD TO SPEND ALL THIS MONEY ON

02:02:32.712 --> 02:02:34.480
AMERICAN RIVER COMMON FEATURES

02:02:34.547 --> 02:02:36.982
ON THE FOLSOM DAM REYES.

02:02:37.049 --> 02:02:38.884
THERE'S TULE RIVER PROJECT AND

02:02:38.951 --> 02:02:40.086
THEN ALSO IN THE U. BUT BASS AND

02:02:40.152 --> 02:02:41.487
AND THAT'S WHERE THAT MONEY IS

02:02:41.554 --> 02:02:43.489
BEING SPENT SO THE BOARD IS

02:02:43.556 --> 02:02:45.191
PARTNERING ON THAT AND THOSE ARE

02:02:45.257 --> 02:02:46.525
SOME VERY EXCITING LARGE SCALE

02:02:46.592 --> 02:02:48.194
PROJECTS BUT IT'S ALSO REQUIRING

02:02:48.260 --> 02:02:50.129
US AS THE GOVERNOR HAS SAID TO

02:02:50.196 --> 02:02:50.629
SORT OF THINK.

02:02:50.696 --> 02:02:52.431
DIFFERENTLY RATHER THAN GOING

02:02:52.498 --> 02:02:53.466
THROUGH HOW WE'VE BEEN GOING

02:02:53.532 --> 02:02:55.101
THROUGH WITH A HUNDRED MILLION A

02:02:55.167 --> 02:02:56.469
YEAR ALLOCATED FROM THE FEDERAL

02:02:56.535 --> 02:02:57.737
GOVERNMENT THEY GOT A GLASS ALL

02:02:57.803 --> 02:02:58.804
AT ONCE AND THEN YOU HAD TO

02:02:58.871 --> 02:03:00.272
REALLY RETHINK HOW YOU'RE DOING

02:03:00.339 --> 02:03:00.973
IT.

02:03:01.040 --> 02:03:02.742
DESIGNING BUILDING CONSTRUCTING

02:03:02.808 --> 02:03:04.276
ALL AROUND ALL AT THE SAME TIME

02:03:04.343 --> 02:03:05.845
SO -- ALL OF THE PARTNERS ARE

02:03:05.911 --> 02:03:09.949
WORKING HARD TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:03:10.015 --> 02:03:12.218
HAPPENS -- ON THE VENUE SIDE

02:03:12.284 --> 02:03:13.886
OVER THE PAST DECADE WE'VE HAD

02:03:13.953 --> 02:03:15.488
HUNDREDS OF MEETINGS AT THE

02:03:15.554 --> 02:03:17.022
BOARD AND THIS IS WHERE.

02:03:17.089 --> 02:03:18.758
WE REALLY APPRECIATE HAVING THE

02:03:18.824 --> 02:03:20.459
LOCAL INTERESTS WE HAVE A A LOT

02:03:20.526 --> 02:03:22.094
OF PARTNERS TO SHOW UP TO THAT

02:03:22.161 --> 02:03:23.729
NOT JUST -- THE MAINTAINERS THAT

02:03:23.796 --> 02:03:26.465

02:03:26.532 --> 02:03:28.434
COME THE PART OF HOW THE

02:03:28.501 --> 02:03:29.902
CONSERVATION STRATEGY WAS SO

02:03:29.969 --> 02:03:31.637
SUCCESSFUL IN THE TWENTY

02:03:31.704 --> 02:03:32.738
SEVENTEEN ITERATION OF THE PLAN

02:03:32.805 --> 02:03:34.340
IS BECAUSE WE HAD A GROUP OF OF

02:03:34.406 --> 02:03:36.041

ECOSYSTEM UP LIFT WE HAVE TO

02:03:42.281 --> 02:03:42.815
HAVE SOMETHING WE CAN MEASURE

02:03:42.882 --> 02:03:44.283
THAT AGAINST AND NOT SOMETHING

02:03:44.350 --> 02:03:45.518
WE'RE STARTING TO WORK ON AND

KEEPING CATASTROPHIC VILLAGE

02:04:28.194 --> 02:04:29.962
FROM HAPPENING MAYOR -- AND IT'S

02:04:30.029 --> 02:04:31.363

02:04:45.044 --> 02:04:46.378
ATMOSPHERIC RIVER GRAPH.

02:04:46.445 --> 02:04:47.847
AND THAT DROVE A LOT OF WHAT

02:04:47.913 --> 02:04:49.615
HAPPENED IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN

02:04:49.682 --> 02:04:50.816
THOSE HIGH WATER EVENTS.

02:04:50.883 --> 02:04:52.718

HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF THE

02:04:58.324 --> 02:04:59.325
DAMAGE FROM THAT AND THAT IS

02:04:59.391 --> 02:05:01.060
DAMAGE WITHOUT A CATASTROPHIC

02:05:01.126 --> 02:05:02.728
FAILURE THOSE ARE JUST THE THE

02:05:02.795 --> 02:05:03.929

THE STATE STILL I HAVE TO COME

02:05:10.069 --> 02:05:11.737

TO FIGURE OUT HOW.

02:05:16.175 --> 02:05:17.443
TO HOW TO MANAGE THAT HOW TO FIX

02:05:17.509 --> 02:05:18.711
THAT HAD TO DEAL WITH THAT AND

02:05:18.777 --> 02:05:20.613
THIS YEAR AGAIN WE HAVE HIGH

02:05:20.679 --> 02:05:22.381
WATER ALTHOUGH NOT THE SAME KIND

02:05:22.448 --> 02:05:24.817
OF HIGH WATER WE HAD TWENTY

02:05:24.884 --> 02:05:25.751
SEVENTEEN AM AS YOU'VE ALREADY

02:05:25.818 --> 02:05:27.686

TO GET OUT OF THE MOUNTAINS AND

02:05:45.638 --> 02:05:46.772
SAFELY THROUGH THE SYSTEM.

02:05:46.839 --> 02:05:47.606
SO ENSURING RESILIENCY THROUGH

THAT ARE FROM LIKE THE CHICO

02:07:53.665 --> 02:07:55.034
MAYBE DOWN TO TRACY SO WE DON'T

02:07:55.100 --> 02:07:57.436
COVER THE UPPER SAN JOAQUIN.

02:07:57.503 --> 02:07:59.738
A PART OF THAT SYSTEM -- BUT

02:07:59.805 --> 02:08:01.306
WITH A LARGE SO PACKED THIS YEAR

02:08:01.373 --> 02:08:02.608

ARE THINKING ABOUT IT -- WHEN I

02:08:06.211 --> 02:08:07.479
STARTED MY JOB ONE OF THE THINGS

02:08:07.546 --> 02:08:08.847
I WENT DID WAS THE TOUR AT THE

02:08:08.914 --> 02:08:10.182
FLIGHT OPERATIONS CENTER SO I

02:08:10.249 --> 02:08:11.683
WAS GLAD TO HEAR THAT THE CHAIR

02:08:11.750 --> 02:08:13.485
DID AND I DO ENCOURAGE THE STAFF

02:08:13.552 --> 02:08:15.521
AND OTHER MEMBERS TO DO THAT --

02:08:15.587 --> 02:08:18.424
IT IS VERY IMPRESSIVE AND IT'S

02:08:18.490 --> 02:08:19.391

MATH AND APPRECIATE ALL THE

02:08:22.327 --> 02:08:24.196
DISCUSSION BECAUSE THIS IS THE

02:08:24.263 --> 02:08:25.130
LOGICAL COMMON SENSE WHEN YOU

02:08:25.197 --> 02:08:26.865
LOOK AT SOME OF THAT IT'S SCARY

02:08:26.932 --> 02:08:28.801
AND ALL THE TIME -- AND THAT'S

02:08:28.867 --> 02:08:30.736
WHAT MY MEMBERS HAVE TO THINK

02:08:30.803 --> 02:08:31.970
ABOUT EVERY SINGLE DAY.

02:08:32.037 --> 02:08:33.906
BUT I YOUR INTRO COMMENTS WERE

02:08:33.972 --> 02:08:34.940
JUST PERFECT IF I THINK SETTING

02:08:35.007 --> 02:08:37.176
THE FOUNDATION FOR WHERE WE'RE

02:08:37.242 --> 02:08:39.144
GOING TO HEAD ON OUR COMMENTS --

02:08:39.211 --> 02:08:40.479
TO AND AS YOU HEARD THIS IS

02:08:40.546 --> 02:08:43.816
REALLY AN X. EXTENSIVE -- SYSTEM --

02:08:43.882 --> 02:08:45.651
AND THE STATE DOES HAVE

02:08:45.717 --> 02:08:47.853
LIABILITY OUR MEMBERS ARE THE

02:08:47.920 --> 02:08:49.488
LOCAL MAINTAINING AGENCIES

02:08:49.555 --> 02:08:51.223
RECLAMATION DISTRICTS.

02:08:51.290 --> 02:08:53.625
AND COLMAR DIS AND BUT THE STATE

02:08:53.692 --> 02:08:55.794
ALTERNATELY STILL MAINTAINS THAT

02:08:55.861 --> 02:08:58.397
LIABILITY THE PATERNAL LAWSUITS --

02:08:58.464 --> 02:08:58.931
SOMEBODY TO ASK QUESTIONS

02:08:58.997 --> 02:09:01.433
EARLIER IT WAS THE NINETEEN

02:09:01.500 --> 02:09:02.000
EIGHTY SIX THERE WAS A LEVEE

02:09:02.067 --> 02:09:03.335
FAILURE OF OUR PROJECT WE CALL

02:09:03.402 --> 02:09:04.903
PROJECT LEVEES OF THE STATE PLAN

02:09:04.970 --> 02:09:06.772
A FLOOD CONTROL -- IT ENDED UP

02:09:06.839 --> 02:09:07.940
IN COURT FOR MORE THAN TWENTY

02:09:08.006 --> 02:09:10.242
YEARS SO IT WASN'T SETTLED UNTIL

02:09:10.309 --> 02:09:10.976
ABOUT TWO THOUSAND FOUR AS I

02:09:11.043 --> 02:09:11.777
RECALL.

02:09:11.844 --> 02:09:12.811
IF YOU CAN REMEMBER OR CONNIE

02:09:12.878 --> 02:09:14.346
DECLINED AT THAT POINT BECAUSE

02:09:14.413 --> 02:09:15.848
CONSTRUCTION HOUSING AND

02:09:15.914 --> 02:09:18.684
COLLAPSED -- IT WAS EIGHT

02:09:18.750 --> 02:09:19.518
HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION DOLLAR

02:09:19.585 --> 02:09:21.854
JUDGMENT -- WILLS INTERESTS THAT

02:09:21.920 --> 02:09:22.855
HAD ACTUALLY CRUDE OVER THAT

02:09:22.921 --> 02:09:25.290
TWENTY SMOKING HERE'S BUT THE

02:09:25.357 --> 02:09:26.592
STATE'S TOTAL FOR FOREIGN FORTY

02:09:26.658 --> 02:09:27.426
MILLION STATE AND HAVE THAT

02:09:27.493 --> 02:09:29.094
MONEY WE WERE WE WERE IN HARD

02:09:29.161 --> 02:09:31.396
ECONOMIC TIME BUDGET TIMES --

02:09:31.463 --> 02:09:37.136
THEY PAID OUT OVER TEN YEARS SO

02:09:37.202 --> 02:09:38.570
IT IT CAN GET YOU KNOW VERY

02:09:38.637 --> 02:09:39.905
EXPENSIVE -- AND SO IT'S THAT

02:09:39.972 --> 02:09:40.572
WHOLE PREVENTION OF THING IS IS

02:09:40.639 --> 02:09:41.106
WHERE WE COME IN OF THE

02:09:41.173 --> 02:09:41.740
MAINTENANCE TO HELP REALLY TRY

02:09:41.807 --> 02:09:43.509
TO MAINTAIN IT.

02:09:43.575 --> 02:09:44.543
GET OUT AHEAD OF IT YOU'RE NEVER

02:09:44.610 --> 02:09:46.211
GOING TO A BE CAUGHT UP BECAUSE

02:09:46.278 --> 02:09:47.613
IT'S LIKE YOUR LAUNDRY YEAH YOU

02:09:47.679 --> 02:09:49.047
MAY HAVE DONE LAUNDRY YESTERDAY

02:09:49.114 --> 02:09:50.249
BUT YOU'RE WEARING CLOTHES BEING

02:09:50.315 --> 02:09:51.016
SOCIABLE FAMILY SO.

02:09:51.083 --> 02:09:52.184
GUESS WHAT YOU GET TO DO YOU IN

02:09:52.251 --> 02:09:53.986
A COUPLE DAYS SO IT'S JUST A

02:09:54.052 --> 02:09:56.655
CONSTANT STATE AND IT'S ABOUT

02:09:56.722 --> 02:09:58.157
ANTICIPATING WHAT'S COMING.

02:09:58.223 --> 02:09:59.458
A HEARING LOVING.

02:09:59.525 --> 02:10:03.762
THE OTHER LEFT -- BUT IT'S A

02:10:03.829 --> 02:10:04.696
ANYWAY OUR OUR MEMBERS REALLY

02:10:04.763 --> 02:10:05.531
DID -- SIGN THESE AGREEMENTS

02:10:05.597 --> 02:10:06.665
WITH THE STATE AS WELL TO BE

02:10:06.732 --> 02:10:09.701
THEIR LOCAL PARTNER IN THAT --

02:10:09.768 --> 02:10:11.103
IN ADDITION LIABILITY THE STATE.

02:10:11.170 --> 02:10:12.304
THERE ARE SOME PLACES WHERE

02:10:12.371 --> 02:10:13.839
THERE ARE NOT RECLAMATION

02:10:13.906 --> 02:10:15.307
DISTRICT SALUTE ALAMAIN.

02:10:15.374 --> 02:10:17.342
AND SO THE STATE ACTUALLY DOES

02:10:17.409 --> 02:10:18.777
MAINTAIN SOME OF THE LEVEES THEY

02:10:18.844 --> 02:10:20.379
HAVE OPERATIONS THAT DO THAT I I

02:10:20.445 --> 02:10:21.280
WANT TO SAY THERE'S NINE OR TEN

02:10:21.346 --> 02:10:23.115
OF THEM -- THAT THEY DO HAVE TWO

02:10:23.182 --> 02:10:23.849
MAIN AREAS THEY MAINTAIN

02:10:23.916 --> 02:10:24.950
THEMSELVES THEY'RE ALSO

02:10:25.017 --> 02:10:26.318
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MAINTENANCE

02:10:26.385 --> 02:10:27.886
OF THOSE BY PASSES.

02:10:27.953 --> 02:10:29.655
THAT WE TALKED ABOUT YOLO AND

02:10:29.721 --> 02:10:30.889
CENTER AND HIS BILL THESE SEVEN

02:10:30.956 --> 02:10:33.425
BY PASSES THAT'S A RELIEF VALVE.

02:10:33.492 --> 02:10:34.726
YOU CAN IMAGINE A REALLY BIG

02:10:34.793 --> 02:10:35.961
WHAT EVENTS WHEN THEY PHILIP

02:10:36.028 --> 02:10:37.129
YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF SENTIMENT

02:10:37.196 --> 02:10:39.398
DEBRIS SO THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY

02:10:39.464 --> 02:10:40.732
THAT I HOPE THE LEGISLATURE

02:10:40.799 --> 02:10:41.967
THINKS ABOUT IN TERMS OF THE

02:10:42.034 --> 02:10:43.468
RESPONSIBILITIES.

02:10:43.535 --> 02:10:45.037
YOU KNOW ON THE STATE SIDE AND

02:10:45.103 --> 02:10:46.505
FOR KEEPING THE CHANNELS BECAUSE

02:10:46.572 --> 02:10:47.606
WE'VE GOT MAPS THAT SHOW THE

02:10:47.673 --> 02:10:49.608
DESIGN CAPACITY FOR THE FLOOD

02:10:49.675 --> 02:10:50.542
FLOWS.

02:10:50.609 --> 02:10:51.376
BUT WHEN YOU GET SETTLEMENT

02:10:51.443 --> 02:10:52.878
STUFF COMING IN EVERY YEAR

02:10:52.945 --> 02:10:54.947
YOU'RE LOSING THAT CAPACITY

02:10:55.013 --> 02:10:56.648
RIGHT SO THERE IS A LOT OF

02:10:56.715 --> 02:10:58.250
MAINTENANCE JUST BE ON THOSE

02:10:58.317 --> 02:10:59.618
LEVEES THAT I HOPE THE

02:10:59.685 --> 02:11:02.321
LEGISLATURE -- WILL THINK ABOUT --

02:11:02.387 --> 02:11:03.655
OUR MEMBERS A LOT OF OUR MEMBERS

02:11:03.722 --> 02:11:05.524
ARE ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR MAIN

02:11:05.591 --> 02:11:07.359
SINCE OF NON PROJECT LEVEES IN

02:11:07.426 --> 02:11:09.861
THE DELTA -- AS WELL BUT

02:11:09.928 --> 02:11:11.797
ESSENTIALLY OF MY MEMBERS WORK

02:11:11.863 --> 02:11:14.266
REVOLVES AROUND ONE PARADIGM --

02:11:14.333 --> 02:11:18.303
AND THAT'S THE FACT THAT EVERY

02:11:18.370 --> 02:11:19.805
WINTER -- ARE LEVEES ARE GONNA

02:11:19.871 --> 02:11:20.572
EXPERIENCE WEAR AND TEAR.

02:11:20.639 --> 02:11:22.207
EVERY SINGLE YEAR AND THEN SOME

02:11:22.274 --> 02:11:24.943
YEARS ARE WORSE THAN OTHERS --

02:11:25.010 --> 02:11:26.278
BUT EVERY YEAR THAT WILL HAPPEN

02:11:26.345 --> 02:11:28.747
SOME THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT.

02:11:28.814 --> 02:11:30.148
I THINK THE COMBINATION OF THE

02:11:30.215 --> 02:11:31.717
INCREASE FUNDING THAT YOU HEARD

02:11:31.783 --> 02:11:34.086
TALK TO BUY BY THE LA HELLO --

02:11:34.152 --> 02:11:36.054
THIS AT NEW CENTRAL VALLEY FLOOD

02:11:36.121 --> 02:11:38.557
PROTECTION PLAN THAT WE HAVE --

02:11:38.624 --> 02:11:40.592
THEY REALLY PAID OFF -- WOULDN'T

02:11:40.659 --> 02:11:43.095
HAVE LEVEE FAILURES IN TWENTY

02:11:43.161 --> 02:11:44.496
SEVENTEEN AND YOU KNOW KNOCK ON

02:11:44.563 --> 02:11:45.264
WOOD WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE

02:11:45.330 --> 02:11:47.299
SOME THIS YEAR DESPITE THE RISKS

02:11:47.366 --> 02:11:49.334
YOU KNOW THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT

02:11:49.401 --> 02:11:52.204
AND FACING -- SO I MEAN TO ME

02:11:52.271 --> 02:11:53.672
THAT IS A REALLY GOOD THING IT

02:11:53.739 --> 02:11:54.840
WE SHOULDN'T EVER FORGET THAT

02:11:54.906 --> 02:11:56.541
THAT RISK IS THERE BUT IT IS

02:11:56.608 --> 02:11:58.710
STILL A VERY GOOD THING -- A

02:11:58.777 --> 02:12:00.212
MAJOR REASON I THINK FOR THE

02:12:00.279 --> 02:12:02.014
COMBINATION OF THIS FUNDING AND

02:12:02.080 --> 02:12:03.815
THE PLANNING IN MY OPINION AS

02:12:03.882 --> 02:12:06.318
HURRICANE KATRINA -- IT WAS A

02:12:06.385 --> 02:12:08.086
DISASTER AND A NIGHTMARE FOR NEW

02:12:08.153 --> 02:12:11.223
ORLEANS BUT IT REALLY ENDED UP --

02:12:11.290 --> 02:12:12.524
BEING MOTIVATION OF THE STATE OF

02:12:12.591 --> 02:12:14.059
CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THEN THE

02:12:14.126 --> 02:12:15.694
LEGISLATURE PASSED LEGISLATION

02:12:15.761 --> 02:12:17.329
REQUIRING THE ADOPTION OF THE

02:12:17.396 --> 02:12:18.664
SOCIAL BALLOT FLOOD PROTECTION

02:12:18.730 --> 02:12:20.065
THAT WE PLAN AND WE ARE NOW

02:12:20.132 --> 02:12:21.233
IMPLEMENTING.

02:12:21.300 --> 02:12:23.335
AND THE VOTERS APPROVED A FLOOD

02:12:23.402 --> 02:12:26.038
ONLY BOND THAT YEAR OF THE FOUR

02:12:26.104 --> 02:12:28.307
BILLION DOLLARS AND I THINK IT

02:12:28.373 --> 02:12:28.907
WAS RATE YOUR QUESTION BECAUSE

02:12:28.974 --> 02:12:29.841
REALLY.

02:12:29.908 --> 02:12:31.643
AFTER THAT SUBSEQUENTLY WE SEEN

02:12:31.710 --> 02:12:33.912
ADDITIONAL -- BOND FUNDING BUT

02:12:33.979 --> 02:12:35.881
IT'S A SMALL PORTION OF WATER

02:12:35.947 --> 02:12:37.516
BONDS THAT ARE BONDS ARE FOCUSED

02:12:37.582 --> 02:12:39.284
ON WATER SUPPLY -- BUT AGAIN

02:12:39.351 --> 02:12:40.285
BECAUSE WE'RE STATE WE HAVE

02:12:40.352 --> 02:12:41.887
DROUGHTS AND FLOODS I MEAN THAT

02:12:41.953 --> 02:12:43.155
THAT'S THE OUR REALITY THAT WE

02:12:43.221 --> 02:12:43.922
LIVE IN.

02:12:43.989 --> 02:12:45.891
BUT THERE'S SO THERE'S SMALLER

02:12:45.957 --> 02:12:47.326
BOND FUNDS THAT GO TOWARDS THAT

02:12:47.392 --> 02:12:49.695
THAT FLOOD RISK IN THE

02:12:49.761 --> 02:12:50.262
OPPORTUNITIES TO BUILD MORE

02:12:50.329 --> 02:12:52.864
STORAGE -- BUT AGAIN IT ENDED UP

02:12:52.931 --> 02:12:57.302
KIND OF A GOOD CASE SUCH

02:12:57.369 --> 02:12:59.104
SITUATION -- THE THING TO KEEP

02:12:59.171 --> 02:12:59.971
IN MIND -- WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

02:13:00.038 --> 02:13:00.772
THE FEDS TO PAY FOR SOME STUFF

02:13:00.839 --> 02:13:01.773
BUT THE ONE THING THAT THEY

02:13:01.840 --> 02:13:02.507
DON'T I DON'T CARE IF YOU'RE

02:13:02.574 --> 02:13:03.875
FEMA OR THEIR ARMY CORPS THEY

02:13:03.942 --> 02:13:05.177
DON'T PAY FOR MAINTENANCE?

02:13:05.243 --> 02:13:07.179
THAT'S ALL ON US BETWEEN THE

02:13:07.245 --> 02:13:09.081
STATE IN THE US -- THAT'S ALL ON

02:13:09.147 --> 02:13:10.182
US THEY DON'T PAY FOR THAT AND

02:13:10.248 --> 02:13:12.184
THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE TALK ABOUT

02:13:12.250 --> 02:13:13.051
FUNDING WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO

02:13:13.118 --> 02:13:16.054
LOOK FOR THAT MEAN INSTALLERS --

02:13:16.121 --> 02:13:17.622
WE DID TALK ABOUT THE INCREASED

02:13:17.689 --> 02:13:19.591
OF RECOGNITION THAT WHEN THE

02:13:19.658 --> 02:13:20.992
BOND FUNDS AREN'T THERE WE DO

02:13:21.059 --> 02:13:22.561
HAVE TO GO TO GENERAL FUND IT'S

02:13:22.627 --> 02:13:24.062
NOT LIKE YOU CAN IGNORE.

02:13:24.129 --> 02:13:25.597
THAT MAINTENANCEIN THOSE GIVEN

02:13:25.664 --> 02:13:27.265
YEARS AND THIRTY MILLION IS NOT

02:13:27.332 --> 02:13:29.401
ENOUGH THAT HUNDRED TWO HUNDRED

02:13:29.468 --> 02:13:30.635
THIRTY MILLION IS REALLY WHERE

02:13:30.702 --> 02:13:32.637
WE'RE HEADING TOWARDS -- BUT

02:13:32.704 --> 02:13:34.272
THROUGH THE IMPLEMENTATION IN

02:13:34.339 --> 02:13:35.440
THESE MONTHLY MEETINGS WHERE WE

02:13:35.507 --> 02:13:36.675
REALLY DO TALK ABOUT THE HARD

02:13:36.742 --> 02:13:40.045
STUFF THERE -- BUT AS WE CAME UP

02:13:40.112 --> 02:13:41.413
WITH THE IDEAS OF CREATING DUE

02:13:41.480 --> 02:13:42.280
TO THE DEPARTMENT ACTUALLY

02:13:42.347 --> 02:13:44.483
CREATED TWO NEW FUNDING PROGRAMS

02:13:44.549 --> 02:13:45.384
FOR MAINTENANCE.

02:13:45.450 --> 02:13:46.651
AND SO NOW WE'VE GOT

02:13:46.718 --> 02:13:48.553
OPPORTUNITIES OF WHERE THE

02:13:48.620 --> 02:13:49.888
LEGISLATURE CAN ACTUALLY

02:13:49.955 --> 02:13:51.790
DIRECTLY APPROPRIATE MONEY WHICH

02:13:51.857 --> 02:13:53.258
THAT DELTA LEVY SUBVENTION

02:13:53.325 --> 02:13:54.760
PROGRAM THAT SHE MENTIONED HAS

02:13:54.826 --> 02:13:56.561
BEEN EXTREMELY SUCCESSFUL OVER

02:13:56.628 --> 02:13:58.230
TOPPING OFF WAS VERY COMMON IN

02:13:58.296 --> 02:13:59.798
THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES.

02:13:59.865 --> 02:14:01.700
FEMA GOT VERY UPSET AT THE STATE --

02:14:01.767 --> 02:14:03.502
AND WE HAVEN'T HAD OVERTOPPING

02:14:03.568 --> 02:14:04.703
IN THE DOUBLE TO SENSE THAT

02:14:04.770 --> 02:14:06.505
PROGRAM CAME AND THE MAINTENANCE

02:14:06.571 --> 02:14:07.873
PROGRAM CAME INTO PLACE.

02:14:07.939 --> 02:14:09.708
AND THE LEGISLATURE DOES

02:14:09.775 --> 02:14:11.877
DIRECTLY APPROPRIATE FUNDING

02:14:11.943 --> 02:14:13.979
TOWARDS THAT AND THAT'S ALWAYS A

02:14:14.045 --> 02:14:16.047
GOOD WAY TO GO -- WE ARE

02:14:16.114 --> 02:14:17.015
CHALLENGED WHEN WE'RE DOING OUR

02:14:17.082 --> 02:14:19.251
COST YEARS WE DO HAVE TO DO PROP

02:14:19.317 --> 02:14:20.152
TWO EIGHTEEN UNLIKE THE STATE

02:14:20.218 --> 02:14:22.120
FOR THEIR MAINTENANCE AREAS --

02:14:22.187 --> 02:14:23.422
SO WE DO HAVE TO GET LAND OVER

02:14:23.488 --> 02:14:25.390
APPROVAL WHEN WE DO NEED TO

02:14:25.457 --> 02:14:26.792
RAISE OUR ASSESSMENTS AND THAT

02:14:26.858 --> 02:14:28.460
CAN BE A CHALLENGE PARTICULARLY

02:14:28.527 --> 02:14:29.795
IN THE URBAN AREAS WHERE WE'VE

02:14:29.861 --> 02:14:31.563
GOT MULTIPLE AGENCIES.

02:14:31.630 --> 02:14:33.832
WE TYPICALLY HAVE -- WHERE I

02:14:33.899 --> 02:14:35.133
LIVE WE HAVE LITTLE JUST A SAFE

02:14:35.200 --> 02:14:36.101
CAR WAS SAFE BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT

02:14:36.168 --> 02:14:38.437
A LARGER AGENCY THAT'S DOING BIG

02:14:38.503 --> 02:14:40.138
CIVIL WORKS IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS

02:14:40.205 --> 02:14:40.839
AND THEN YOU HAVE THE

02:14:40.906 --> 02:14:42.707
RECLAMATION DISTRICT THAT ONCE

02:14:42.774 --> 02:14:43.775
THOSE PROJECTS ARE DONE?

02:14:43.842 --> 02:14:45.544
THEY TURN OVER FOR MAINTENANCE

02:14:45.610 --> 02:14:47.379
OF THE RECLAMATION DISTRICTS BUT

02:14:47.446 --> 02:14:48.780
YOU GET CHARGED TWICE IF YOU'RE

02:14:48.847 --> 02:14:50.615
A LANDOWNER WITHIN THAT AREA

02:14:50.682 --> 02:14:51.817
FROM TWO DIFFERENT ENTITIES AND

02:14:51.883 --> 02:14:52.884
THEY'RE LIKE WELL I DON'T

02:14:52.951 --> 02:14:53.652
UNDERSTAND WHY I'M GETTING

02:14:53.718 --> 02:14:53.919
CHARGED.

02:14:53.985 --> 02:14:55.187
FROM TWICE FOR THE SAME THING

02:14:55.253 --> 02:14:57.222
FLOOD -- SO THEY HAVE TO

02:14:57.289 --> 02:14:58.390
COORDINATE WHEN THEY'RE GOING TO

02:14:58.457 --> 02:14:59.458
DO THERE BECAUSE EACH GONNA NEED

02:14:59.524 --> 02:15:01.126
TO DO TO EIGHTEEN THERE'S A LOT

02:15:01.193 --> 02:15:07.466
OF CHOREOGRAPHY THAT HAS TO GO

02:15:07.532 --> 02:15:08.633
ON LOCALLY -- THE LEVEL OF

02:15:08.700 --> 02:15:09.768
COOPERATION AT THE FLOOD BOARD

02:15:09.835 --> 02:15:10.469
THOUGH IN OUR COORDINATING

02:15:10.535 --> 02:15:11.069
COMMITTEE MEETINGS I HAVE TO

02:15:11.136 --> 02:15:11.603
DEAL WITH A LOT OF STATE

02:15:11.670 --> 02:15:12.838
AGENCIES IN MY ROLE. FOR THE

02:15:12.904 --> 02:15:15.173
ASSOCIATION AND I WILL SAY THE

02:15:15.240 --> 02:15:17.042
IT IS VERY NEEDS THE AMOUNT I

02:15:17.108 --> 02:15:19.511
THINK OF INCLUSION THAT THEY

02:15:19.578 --> 02:15:20.779
HAVE THAT THEY ACTUALLY INCLUDE

02:15:20.846 --> 02:15:22.013
THIS AND WHEN WHERE THEY'RE

02:15:22.080 --> 02:15:24.115
DEVELOPING THINGS -- AND THE

02:15:24.182 --> 02:15:26.284
AMOUNT OF TRANSPARENCY SO YOU

02:15:26.351 --> 02:15:27.452
KNOW WE DO GET A REALLY GOOD

02:15:27.519 --> 02:15:29.020
PARTNERSHIP WHICH IS WHY WERE

02:15:29.087 --> 02:15:30.689
ABLE TO THEN GET THAT LOCAL

02:15:30.755 --> 02:15:32.023
SUPPORT THAT'S NEEDED FOR THE

02:15:32.090 --> 02:15:35.594
IMPLEMENTATION THAT LESLIE --

02:15:35.660 --> 02:15:35.927
TALKED ABOUT.

02:15:35.994 --> 02:15:37.095
SOME.

02:15:37.162 --> 02:15:39.498
THE I DID PROVIDE A HAND OUTS --

02:15:39.564 --> 02:15:41.299
WHICH JUST BECAUSE YOU HEAR US

02:15:41.366 --> 02:15:42.901
TALK ABOUT DAMAGE TO LEVEES

02:15:42.968 --> 02:15:44.669
EROSION SEEPAGE I JUST WANT TO

02:15:44.736 --> 02:15:46.838
PROVIDE SOME PHOTOS I KNOW I'M

02:15:46.905 --> 02:15:47.672
THAT TYPE OF PERSON IN ADDITION

02:15:47.739 --> 02:15:48.507
A NEW.

02:15:48.573 --> 02:15:49.541
TREND THE FLIGHT OPERATIONS I

02:15:49.608 --> 02:15:50.575
WENT MY OUTLOOK TO LEVEES AND

02:15:50.642 --> 02:15:51.576
LIKE I NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT

02:15:51.643 --> 02:15:52.777
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

02:15:52.844 --> 02:15:54.546
THAT'S THE KIND OF DAMAGE AND IT

02:15:54.613 --> 02:15:55.714
WAS IN THE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS

02:15:55.780 --> 02:15:57.148
OF DOLLARS WE HAVE NOT FINISHED

02:15:57.215 --> 02:15:59.284
DOING THOSE REPAIRS AND

02:15:59.351 --> 02:16:00.919
UNDERSTAND AS THESE HIGH WATER.

02:16:00.986 --> 02:16:03.021
THE WATER STAYS HIGH WE CANNOT

02:16:03.088 --> 02:16:04.923
SEE THE DAMAGE BEING DONE THIS

02:16:04.990 --> 02:16:06.057
YEAR BUT WE KNOW IT IS BEING

02:16:06.124 --> 02:16:08.093
DONE -- LESLIE -- MEGAN'S GONNA

02:16:08.159 --> 02:16:09.561
TALK INITIAL TALK ABOUT HOW

02:16:09.628 --> 02:16:11.463
WATER LEVELS GO UP AND DOWN IT'S

02:16:11.530 --> 02:16:13.331
THE EROSION IS OCCURRING.

02:16:13.398 --> 02:16:14.065
BUT IF WE CAN'T SEE IT UNTIL

02:16:14.132 --> 02:16:16.568
JULY WE HAVE A VERY SHORT WINDOW

02:16:16.635 --> 02:16:17.836
TO DO THOSE REPAIRS.

02:16:17.903 --> 02:16:19.204
SO IN ADDITION TO THINKING ABOUT

02:16:19.271 --> 02:16:20.105
WHAT KIND OF MONEY THE

02:16:20.171 --> 02:16:21.973
LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO APPROPRIATE

02:16:22.040 --> 02:16:23.341
FOR MAINTENANCE OF ITS SYSTEM

02:16:23.408 --> 02:16:24.876
YOU NEED TO ANTICIPATE MAYBE

02:16:24.943 --> 02:16:25.777
THIS YEAR.

02:16:25.844 --> 02:16:27.746
ON PUTTING SOME MONEY TOWARDS

02:16:27.812 --> 02:16:29.381
THE REPAIRS.

02:16:29.447 --> 02:16:30.615
THAT WE NEED TO DO BETWEEN JULY

02:16:30.682 --> 02:16:31.516
AND THE BEGINNING OF THAT

02:16:31.583 --> 02:16:33.485
OCTOBER YOU KNOW FLOOD NOVEMBER

02:16:33.552 --> 02:16:36.788
YOU KNOW FLOOD SEASON REALLY

02:16:36.855 --> 02:16:38.557
STARTING -- AND I THINK BEING

02:16:38.623 --> 02:16:39.190
ISN'T TALK ABOUT A LITTLE BIT

02:16:39.257 --> 02:16:40.091
THAT ARE MEMBERS OF THE ONES

02:16:40.158 --> 02:16:41.393
THAT.

02:16:41.459 --> 02:16:43.328
ARE DOING THAT THAT -- THE DAILY

02:16:43.395 --> 02:16:45.397
PATROL AND SO YOU HEARD ABOUT

02:16:45.463 --> 02:16:47.265
THE C. DECK IN THE GAUGES THEY

02:16:47.332 --> 02:16:49.267
DO GO ONLINE AND LOOK AT THOSE

02:16:49.334 --> 02:16:50.302
DAILY.

02:16:50.368 --> 02:16:51.403
AND THEY DO HAVE WITH RICK

02:16:51.469 --> 02:16:52.871
USUALLY EACH DISTRICT WILL HAVE

02:16:52.938 --> 02:16:54.539
OKAY WHEN LET'S SAY I STREET

02:16:54.606 --> 02:16:56.308
BRIDGE GETS TO THIS LEVEL THAT'S

02:16:56.374 --> 02:16:57.742
WHEN WE'RE GONNA START OR TWENTY

02:16:57.809 --> 02:16:59.010
FOUR HOUR PATROLS RIGHT.

02:16:59.077 --> 02:17:00.178
SO THEY THEY KNOW WHEN THEY'RE

02:17:00.245 --> 02:17:01.680
GONNA START DOING THOSE THINGS

02:17:01.746 --> 02:17:03.248
AND THEN THEY START MARKING AND

02:17:03.315 --> 02:17:05.450
PAYING ATTENTION -- BUT THEY

02:17:05.517 --> 02:17:06.885
THEY ACTUALLY DO THOSE AND OUR

02:17:06.952 --> 02:17:08.286
FEAR OR THINGS LIKE HAVING THAT

02:17:08.353 --> 02:17:09.588
LARGE SNOW PACK AND A PINEAPPLE

02:17:09.654 --> 02:17:11.756
EXPRESS COME THROUGH -- THE

02:17:11.823 --> 02:17:12.657
REALLY HOT DAYS THEY'RE JUST

02:17:12.724 --> 02:17:15.794
GONNA -- MELTED SO FAST -- BUT

02:17:15.860 --> 02:17:17.629
YOU DO HAVE TO BE CONCERNED YOU

02:17:17.696 --> 02:17:19.731
KNOW WHETHER THIS IS OUR NEW

02:17:19.798 --> 02:17:21.800
NORM OF HAVING TO DEAL WITH

02:17:21.866 --> 02:17:23.268
THESE VERY SCARY NUMBERS WHEN

02:17:23.335 --> 02:17:25.036
YOU LOOK AT A PIECE OF PAPER WHO

02:17:25.103 --> 02:17:26.905
WOULDN'T BE AFRAID. TO DO LIKE

02:17:26.972 --> 02:17:27.906
YOU SAID IT JUST TAKES

02:17:27.973 --> 02:17:29.975
COMMONSENSE TALKED ABOUT IT IT

02:17:30.041 --> 02:17:31.810
DOESN'T TAKE IN A CIVIL ENGINEER.

02:17:31.876 --> 02:17:33.445
STAND YOU KNOW THAT IT'S THAT

02:17:33.511 --> 02:17:37.649
IT'S A LITTLE SCARY OUT THERE --

02:17:37.716 --> 02:17:40.085
OF I THINK I'VE HIT ON THAT -- I

02:17:40.151 --> 02:17:40.685
WANT TO PUT IN A PLUG FOR THE

02:17:40.752 --> 02:17:41.653
CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS OF

02:17:41.720 --> 02:17:42.520
IS YOU KNOW NOT PART OF MY

02:17:42.587 --> 02:17:44.122
MEMBERSHIP BUT WHETHER YOU'RE

02:17:44.189 --> 02:17:45.523
THE LARGE RIVER SYSTEMS THEY'RE

02:17:45.590 --> 02:17:47.125
ALREADY TRAINED THEY KNOW HOW TO

02:17:47.192 --> 02:17:48.526
LATE OF THE SCREEN.

02:17:48.593 --> 02:17:50.028
THEY KNOW HOW TO SAND BAG

02:17:50.095 --> 02:17:52.430
PROPERLY HOW TO LAY IT PROPERLY

02:17:52.497 --> 02:17:55.066
AND FAST AND THEN FOR THE CREEK

02:17:55.133 --> 02:17:56.768
SYSTEMS THAT THE THE CURSE

02:17:56.835 --> 02:17:58.236
SOMEONE OR SEE IT TALKED ABOUT.

02:17:58.303 --> 02:17:59.638
THEY'RE ALSO REALLY CRITICAL IN

02:17:59.704 --> 02:18:01.106
THOSE LOCAL AREAS FOR THAT

02:18:01.172 --> 02:18:02.273
BECAUSE THEY ARE JUST SO FAST

02:18:02.340 --> 02:18:03.742
AND I THINK THEY DON'T GET

02:18:03.808 --> 02:18:05.176
ENOUGH CREDIT FOR REALLY HOW

02:18:05.243 --> 02:18:06.444
IMPORTANT THEY ARE AND I DON'T

02:18:06.511 --> 02:18:07.846
CARE RICH FLAVOR IT'S FIRE TO I

02:18:07.912 --> 02:18:08.913

02:18:09.614 --> 02:18:15.487
GREAT -- ENTITY TO HAVE -- THE I

02:18:15.553 --> 02:18:16.187
THINK WE TALKED ABOUT SO.

02:18:16.254 --> 02:18:17.789
THOSE THINGS THE AMOUNT OF MONEY

02:18:17.856 --> 02:18:19.424
THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR THE NEW

02:18:19.491 --> 02:18:20.558
PROGRAMS I'M GONNA LEAVE YOU

02:18:20.625 --> 02:18:22.527
JUST WITH THREE WORDS TO THINK

02:18:22.594 --> 02:18:24.929
ABOUT -- ONE IS VIGILANCE

02:18:24.996 --> 02:18:26.498
THEY'RE JUST REALLY IS A CERTAIN

02:18:26.564 --> 02:18:27.565
LEVEL OF MAINTENANCE THAT'S

02:18:27.632 --> 02:18:30.669
NECESSARY -- TO REDUCE THE RISKS

02:18:30.735 --> 02:18:32.037
TO QUALIFY FOR THAT FEDERAL

02:18:32.103 --> 02:18:33.571
REPAIR FUNDING FROM BOTH

02:18:33.638 --> 02:18:35.273
PROGRAMS ARE GOING TO WANT TO

02:18:35.340 --> 02:18:36.508
KNOW THAT WE DID OUR MAINTENANCE.

02:18:36.574 --> 02:18:38.943
AND ALSO TO RESPOND TO CLIMATE

02:18:39.010 --> 02:18:40.578
CHANGE IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.

02:18:40.645 --> 02:18:42.347
THE SECOND WORD IS SYNERGY --

02:18:42.414 --> 02:18:43.682
THE FLOOD BOARD LIKE I SAID IT

02:18:43.748 --> 02:18:45.183
HAS A PLAN FOR THE STATE PLAN A

02:18:45.250 --> 02:18:47.152
FLOOD CONTROL -- INCLUDING THE

02:18:47.218 --> 02:18:48.653
EXPENDITURES THAT ARE REALLY

02:18:48.720 --> 02:18:51.990
NEEDED -- FOR IMPLEMENTATION AND

02:18:52.057 --> 02:18:53.324
WE HAVE SUCH REAL IMPRESSIVE

02:18:53.391 --> 02:18:55.060
LEVEL OF COORDINATION AND

02:18:55.126 --> 02:18:57.162
COOPERATION -- THAT YOU JUST

02:18:57.228 --> 02:18:58.063
DON'T SEE ANY OTHER STATE

02:18:58.129 --> 02:19:00.265
AGENCIES AT LEAST I DON'T AND

02:19:00.331 --> 02:19:01.666

APPROPRIATIONS -- BOND FUNDING

02:19:06.604 --> 02:19:07.872
IS NOT THAT RELIABLE SO

02:19:07.939 --> 02:19:09.441
HOPEFULLY THE LEGISLATURE CAN

02:19:09.507 --> 02:19:10.909
GET USED TO SOME LEVEL OF

02:19:10.975 --> 02:19:11.943
GENERAL FUND.

SISTER DISTRICTS -- AND WE'VE

02:20:40.899 --> 02:20:41.900

02:20:41.966 --> 02:20:45.737
DISTRICTS -- SINCE THE INCEPTION --

02:20:45.804 --> 02:20:46.638
WE WERE COST EFFECTIVELY AND

NINETY MILES OF LEVEES THAT SPAN

02:20:50.241 --> 02:20:52.577

FEEDS INTO THE YOLO BYPASS.

02:20:56.848 --> 02:20:58.716
IT PROTECTS OVER ONE HUNDRED

02:20:58.783 --> 02:21:00.685
THOUSAND ACRES OF PRIME FARMLAND

02:21:00.752 --> 02:21:04.889

DISTRICTS THAT I MENTIONED -- SO

02:21:19.737 --> 02:21:20.505
IN ADDITION TO FLOOD AND

02:21:20.572 --> 02:21:22.640
DRAINAGE ON WE DO DRAINAGE AS

02:21:22.707 --> 02:21:24.309
WELL AND ARE YOU WANT TO WAIT --

SO LIKE MOST OTHER LOCAL

02:21:34.886 --> 02:21:36.988
MAINTAINING AGENCIES WERE A LAND

02:21:37.055 --> 02:21:39.557
OWNER RUN WORK -- AGENCY WE HAVE

02:21:39.624 --> 02:21:41.626

NINETY MILES OF LEVEE.

02:21:51.102 --> 02:21:52.303
SO IN THE SIMPLEST FORM MANY

02:21:52.370 --> 02:21:53.972

02:21:54.038 --> 02:21:55.640
AGENCY SIMPLY GOES OUT AND

02:21:55.707 --> 02:21:57.208

PATROLS WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT

02:22:02.447 --> 02:22:04.782
BUT IN REALITY WE DO WAY MORE.

02:22:04.849 --> 02:22:08.486
THAN THOSE EVERYDAY ITEMS -- SO

02:22:08.553 --> 02:22:10.255
WE WORK CLOSELY WITH THE CENTRAL

02:22:10.321 --> 02:22:11.589

HEARD -- WE'VE ALSO WORKED

02:22:17.495 --> 02:22:18.496
REALLY HARD TO FOSTER CLOSE

02:22:18.563 --> 02:22:20.665
RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR COUNTIES

02:22:20.732 --> 02:22:22.333

02:22:24.335 --> 02:22:26.070
DURING TIMES OF EMERGENCY --

02:22:26.137 --> 02:22:27.438
IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT FOR US TO

02:22:27.505 --> 02:22:28.506
FOSTER RELATIONSHIPS ACROSS THE

02:22:28.573 --> 02:22:29.941

02:22:39.284 --> 02:22:40.485
SIDE IS THE TUESDAY -- BY PASS

02:22:40.551 --> 02:22:41.753
IF THAT IS THE BY PASS DOESN'T

02:22:41.819 --> 02:22:43.388
FUNCTION GUESS WHAT THE WATER

02:22:43.454 --> 02:22:46.057
GOES DOWN THROUGH MY LEVEES AND

02:22:46.124 --> 02:22:47.926
PROVIDES GREATER RISK AND SO THE

02:22:47.992 --> 02:22:50.028

WE ARE ONE OF SIX REGIONS -- AND

02:23:22.126 --> 02:23:23.995

02:23:32.537 --> 02:23:34.672
COVERS A SEVEN COUNTY AREA OR

02:23:34.739 --> 02:23:38.242
PRETTY BIG AREA -- AND I WOULD I

02:23:38.309 --> 02:23:39.577
WOULD ARGUE THAT THE DEVELOPMENT

02:23:39.644 --> 02:23:40.611
OF THOSE REGIONS AND THE

02:23:40.678 --> 02:23:41.913
INVOLVEMENT OF THE LOCALS WAS

BEING COLLABORATIVE IN THAT

02:23:51.089 --> 02:23:57.428
UPDATE MADE THAT A SUCCESS -- SO

02:23:57.495 --> 02:23:58.696
ONE OF THE OTHER ITEMS THAT

02:23:58.763 --> 02:24:00.231
WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO REGIONALLY

02:24:00.298 --> 02:24:01.866

FOR IT JUST EVERYTHING IS MAKES

02:24:27.392 --> 02:24:28.526
IT MORE COMPLICATED SO IT'S

02:24:28.593 --> 02:24:30.895
CRITICAL THAT WE'RE ALL TALKING.

02:24:30.962 --> 02:24:31.763
I MEAN IF ONE OF OUR LEVEE

02:24:31.829 --> 02:24:35.033

NOT GONNA STOP COUNTY LINE ROAD.

02:24:36.200 --> 02:24:36.934
IT'S GOING TO CROSS IT AND GO

02:24:37.001 --> 02:24:39.270

US WORK BETTER TOGETHER AND

02:24:43.441 --> 02:24:45.309
BECOME CLOSER WITH OUR COUNTY --

02:24:45.376 --> 02:24:46.411
YES OFFICES.

02:24:46.477 --> 02:24:47.945
I'M PART OF THAT ESTABLISHED --

02:24:48.012 --> 02:24:49.547
STOCKPILE MATERIALS WE BUILT

02:24:49.614 --> 02:24:50.615
CONTAINERIZED FLOOD FIGHT

02:24:50.681 --> 02:24:53.718
MATERIAL THAT WE USED IN --

02:24:53.785 --> 02:24:54.619
TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE WROTE

02:24:54.685 --> 02:24:57.989
EMERGENCY OPERATIONS PLANS WHICH

02:24:58.056 --> 02:24:59.357
YEAH UNFORTUNATELY FOR ME MY

02:24:59.424 --> 02:25:00.258
FIRST DAY ON THE JOB WAS THE

02:25:00.324 --> 02:25:03.895
FIRST DAY LEVY PATROL IN.

02:25:03.961 --> 02:25:05.663
TWENTY SEVENTEEN SO I CAME IN.

02:25:05.730 --> 02:25:06.798
YOU KNOW I DIDN'T KNOW ANY

02:25:06.864 --> 02:25:08.399
LANDMARK I KNEW LEVEES I HAD

02:25:08.466 --> 02:25:09.333
BEEN WORKING IN IT FOR A VERY

02:25:09.400 --> 02:25:10.935
LONG TIME BUT I DIDN'T KNOW THE

02:25:11.002 --> 02:25:13.037
LOCAL AREA AS WELL -- AND

02:25:13.104 --> 02:25:14.405
WITHOUT THAT PLAN.

02:25:14.472 --> 02:25:15.807
I WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ABLE TO

02:25:15.873 --> 02:25:17.408
EXECUTE AS WELL SO THOSE

02:25:17.475 --> 02:25:19.243
EMERGENCY RESPONSE GRANTS HAVE

02:25:19.310 --> 02:25:24.348
BEEN PHENOMENAL -- SO.

02:25:24.415 --> 02:25:26.084
WE ALL THE OTHER PART OF THE

02:25:26.150 --> 02:25:27.218
GRANT WE CREATED ALL OF WHAT I'M

02:25:27.285 --> 02:25:28.252
CALLING ON THE FLY FLOOD FIGHT

02:25:28.319 --> 02:25:30.988
TRAINING -- SO WE CAN GO TRAIN

02:25:31.055 --> 02:25:32.457
OUR FARMERS WHICH WE HAVE OUR

02:25:32.523 --> 02:25:33.891
WE'VE GONE TO SOME OF THE LARGER

02:25:33.958 --> 02:25:34.725
FARMS WE'VE TRAINED THEIR

02:25:34.792 --> 02:25:36.394
FARMWORKERS WITH AN ONLINE VIDEO

02:25:36.461 --> 02:25:38.129
IN FOUR HOURS TO BE ABLE TO HELP

02:25:38.196 --> 02:25:39.530
US WITH OUR FLOOD FIGHT SO.

02:25:39.597 --> 02:25:40.998
FOR IF WE CAN'T USE THE SEE SEE

02:25:41.065 --> 02:25:42.467
SEE WE CAN GO TO OUR LOCAL

02:25:42.533 --> 02:25:45.002
FARMERS AND SUPPLEMENT OUR STAFF

02:25:45.069 --> 02:25:46.904
DURING TIMES OF EVENT -- AND

02:25:46.971 --> 02:25:48.506
IT'S IT'S IT JUST MAKES A LOT

02:25:48.573 --> 02:25:50.174
MORE SENSE TO INVEST IN THE

02:25:50.241 --> 02:25:51.843
PLANNING NOW.

02:25:51.909 --> 02:25:53.444
THAN IN THE CATASTROPHIC FAILURE

02:25:53.511 --> 02:25:55.413
AFTERWARDS AND WE SEEN IT THE

02:25:55.480 --> 02:25:56.681
MIDWEST THIS YEAR.

02:25:56.747 --> 02:25:58.583
THEY'RE GONNA HAVE A LONG ROAD

02:25:58.649 --> 02:26:00.218
AHEAD TO RECOVER FROM THAT

02:26:00.284 --> 02:26:01.786
ECONOMIC DAMAGE AND SO IF

02:26:01.853 --> 02:26:04.055
EVERYTHING WE CAN DO TO PLAN AND

02:26:04.122 --> 02:26:05.723
PREVENT THAT IS CRITICAL.

02:26:05.790 --> 02:26:07.258
SO PART OF THAT AND WE TALKED A

02:26:07.325 --> 02:26:08.159
LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE ARMY CORPS

02:26:08.226 --> 02:26:09.393
OF ENGINEERS PROGRAMS FOR

02:26:09.460 --> 02:26:11.062
REHABILITATION ASSISTANCE AND SO

02:26:11.129 --> 02:26:12.196
MANY GIVE YOU SOME CONTEXT IN

02:26:12.263 --> 02:26:13.564
NUMBERS.

02:26:13.631 --> 02:26:17.435
SO WE JOINTLY WITH SEVERAL OTHER

02:26:17.502 --> 02:26:18.736
RECLAMATION DISTRICTS JOINED TO

02:26:18.803 --> 02:26:20.138
DEVELOP WHAT'S CALLED A SYSTEM

02:26:20.204 --> 02:26:21.305
WIDE IMPROVEMENT FRAMEWORK.

02:26:21.372 --> 02:26:23.908
IT'S BASICALLY A DOCUMENT THAT

02:26:23.975 --> 02:26:25.042
YOU HAVE TO PROVIDE THE ARMY

02:26:25.109 --> 02:26:27.011
CORPS OF ENGINEERS AS A GET WELL

02:26:27.078 --> 02:26:27.979
PLAN.

02:26:28.045 --> 02:26:28.846
THIS IS ALL THE DEFERRED

02:26:28.913 --> 02:26:29.647
MAINTENANCE THAT YOU'VE

02:26:29.714 --> 02:26:31.415
IDENTIFIED THAT WE NEED TO FIX

02:26:31.482 --> 02:26:32.950
THIS IS OUR PLAN FOR FIXING IT

02:26:33.017 --> 02:26:34.252
AND WE'RE GONNA DO IT AS A TEAM

02:26:34.318 --> 02:26:35.686
THEY LOOK THEY DON'T LOOK AT

02:26:35.753 --> 02:26:36.988
EACH RECLAMATION DISTRICT

02:26:37.054 --> 02:26:38.122
SEPARATELY.

02:26:38.189 --> 02:26:39.891
THEY LOOK AT PROTECTED AREAS SO

02:26:39.957 --> 02:26:41.726
MY PARTICULAR AREA THAT ALREADY

02:26:41.792 --> 02:26:43.427
ONE AWAY AND SACRAMENTO RIVER

02:26:43.494 --> 02:26:44.095
WEST SIDE LEVY DISTRICT ARE PART

02:26:44.162 --> 02:26:46.197
OF HAVE THREE OTHER LOCAL

02:26:46.264 --> 02:26:50.401
MAINTAINING THE SYSTEM OF A

02:26:50.468 --> 02:26:51.636
HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILES. TO

02:26:51.702 --> 02:26:53.104
STAY ELIGIBLE THAT WHOLE HUNDRED

02:26:53.171 --> 02:26:56.207
AND TWENTY MILES HAS TO BE GOOD.

02:26:56.274 --> 02:26:58.476
SO WE HAVE TO WORK TO GET HER --

02:26:58.543 --> 02:27:02.680
WE SPENT UP -- ABOUT TWENTY SIX

02:27:02.747 --> 02:27:03.181
THOUSAND DOLLARS PUTTING

02:27:03.247 --> 02:27:04.615
TOGETHER THE PLAN -- IT'S STILL

02:27:04.682 --> 02:27:05.416
GOING THROUGH THE APPROVAL

02:27:05.483 --> 02:27:06.817
PROCESS BUT WHILE IT GOES TO

02:27:06.884 --> 02:27:08.853
THAT APPROVAL PROCESS YOU REMAIN

02:27:08.920 --> 02:27:09.387
ELIGIBLE FOR THIS FEDERAL

02:27:09.453 --> 02:27:12.190
FUNDING. TWENTY SEVENTEEN HEAD.

02:27:12.256 --> 02:27:15.026
OUR BASIN WAS ELIGIBLE FOR FORTY

02:27:15.092 --> 02:27:15.993
MILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL

02:27:16.060 --> 02:27:17.395
FUNDING.

02:27:17.461 --> 02:27:18.596
I LOVE TWENTY SIX THOUSAND

02:27:18.663 --> 02:27:20.264
DOLLAR INVESTMENT.

02:27:20.331 --> 02:27:21.232
NOW WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO

02:27:21.299 --> 02:27:22.600
ADDRESS COMMENTS AND WE'RE GONNA

02:27:22.667 --> 02:27:24.602
HAVE TO REINVEST EVERY YEAR.

02:27:24.669 --> 02:27:26.537
BUT IT'S REALLY CLEAR THAT'S A

02:27:26.604 --> 02:27:27.371
GOOD INVESTMENT [inaudible]

02:27:27.438 --> 02:27:29.207
SO.

02:27:29.273 --> 02:27:31.409
WE WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO

02:27:31.475 --> 02:27:32.843
CONTINUE THAT PROGRAM AND THEN

02:27:32.910 --> 02:27:34.045
WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT

02:27:34.111 --> 02:27:35.279
IT SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN ALL

02:27:35.346 --> 02:27:36.414
THAT DEFERRED MAINTENANCE THAT

02:27:36.480 --> 02:27:37.281
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT

02:27:37.348 --> 02:27:39.417
ACTUALLY HAS TO GET TAKEN CARE

02:27:39.483 --> 02:27:43.321
OF SO.

02:27:43.387 --> 02:27:45.256
WE'VE THE BOARD HAS MELINDA SAID

02:27:45.323 --> 02:27:46.090
IS BEEN PUTTING DOWN A

02:27:46.157 --> 02:27:47.425
COORDINATING COMMITTEES AND AND

02:27:47.491 --> 02:27:49.293
DIFFERENT COMMITTEES AND AND SO

02:27:49.360 --> 02:27:50.928
ONE OF THE RECENT COMMITTEES.

02:27:50.995 --> 02:27:51.529
AS THE INSPECTION COMPLIANCE

02:27:51.596 --> 02:27:53.497
WORK GROUP HOW DO WE GET

02:27:53.564 --> 02:27:56.167
TOGETHER. TO TO MAKE ALL OF OUR

02:27:56.234 --> 02:27:57.802
JOINTLY WORK TOGETHER TO FIX ALL

02:27:57.868 --> 02:27:59.503
THESE MAINTENANCE DEFICIENCIES

02:27:59.570 --> 02:28:01.172
AND SO WE'RE STARTING ON THAT

02:28:01.239 --> 02:28:02.873
AND I HAVE GREAT HOPE THAT WE'LL

02:28:02.940 --> 02:28:04.408
BE ABLE TO WORK TOGETHER. TO

02:28:04.475 --> 02:28:05.943
MINIMIZE COSTS FOR EVERYBODY

02:28:06.010 --> 02:28:07.645
BECAUSE IF WE CAN WORK TOGETHER.

02:28:07.712 --> 02:28:09.046
THEN WE CAN I'M NOT SPENDING

02:28:09.113 --> 02:28:10.348
MONEY IN ANOTHER IDEAS IT'S BEEN

02:28:10.414 --> 02:28:13.117
MANY ON THE SAME THING LETS YOU

02:28:13.184 --> 02:28:15.519
KNOW POOL OUR RESOURCES -- TO A

02:28:15.586 --> 02:28:16.320
LITTLE BIT ABOUT THIS YEAR YOU

02:28:16.387 --> 02:28:18.189
KNOW ITTHIS YEAR'S FLOOD EVENT

02:28:18.256 --> 02:28:21.325
I THINK WAS REALLY DECEIVING --

02:28:21.392 --> 02:28:21.926
DECEIVING BECAUSE THE SYSTEM

02:28:21.993 --> 02:28:23.527
WORK WE HAVE A CATASTROPHIC

02:28:23.594 --> 02:28:25.329
FAILURES RATE SO THAT'S A GOOD

02:28:25.396 --> 02:28:26.364
THING.

02:28:26.430 --> 02:28:27.565
BUT WE ALSO NEED TO MAKE SURE

02:28:27.632 --> 02:28:29.433
THAT PEOPLE ARE AWARE THERE'S

02:28:29.500 --> 02:28:31.102
GOING TO BE DAMAGE AND IT VERY

02:28:31.168 --> 02:28:32.770
WELL MIGHT BE SIGNIFICANT AND

02:28:32.837 --> 02:28:34.538
IT'S STILL UNDER WATER IN MANY.

02:28:34.605 --> 02:28:36.407
PLACES I KNOW IN THE SACRAMENTO

02:28:36.474 --> 02:28:37.808
VALLEY ARE ARE RIVERS WILL COME

02:28:37.875 --> 02:28:39.677
DOWN -- THE SAME JOAQUIN YOU

02:28:39.744 --> 02:28:41.312
KNOW IT'LL STAY UP FOR AWHILE

02:28:41.379 --> 02:28:43.514
AND SO WE WON'T REALLY

02:28:43.581 --> 02:28:45.149
UNDERSTAND WHAT A REVISION --

02:28:45.216 --> 02:28:47.118
DAMAGE THAT WE HAVE UNTIL THOSE

02:28:47.184 --> 02:28:49.287
RIVERS RECEIPT -- AND I I WAS

02:28:49.353 --> 02:28:51.422
COMPARING TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO

02:28:51.489 --> 02:28:52.490
TWENTY NINETEEN A LITTLE BIT AND

02:28:52.556 --> 02:28:54.058
NOTICED THAT THE FLUCTUATION AT

02:28:54.125 --> 02:28:55.192
THE BEGINNING OF THE SEASON WAS

02:28:55.259 --> 02:28:57.628
MUCH MORE DRAMATIC THAN IN

02:28:57.695 --> 02:28:58.562
TWENTY SEVENTEEN WHICHMEANS.

02:28:58.629 --> 02:29:00.331
THE RIVERS GO UP AND DOWN A LOT

02:29:00.398 --> 02:29:02.166
WE SEE MORE RUSSIAN WHEN THE

02:29:02.233 --> 02:29:03.367
LIVER'S LIVE EAST IRWIN THE

02:29:03.434 --> 02:29:04.735
REVERSE JUST STAY UP LIKE THEY

02:29:04.802 --> 02:29:05.836
DID IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE SEE A

02:29:05.903 --> 02:29:06.704
LOT MORE SEEPAGE.

02:29:06.771 --> 02:29:08.839
WHICH YOU CAN SEE EASIER DURING

02:29:08.906 --> 02:29:10.174
THE EVENT THE EROSION.

02:29:10.241 --> 02:29:13.444
WE WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT WE

02:29:13.511 --> 02:29:14.545
HAVE -- SO THAT'S GOING TO BE

02:29:14.612 --> 02:29:18.749
IMPORTANT TO KEEP AN EYE ON WE

02:29:18.816 --> 02:29:22.453
IT MOST PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE

02:29:22.520 --> 02:29:23.187
THAT.

02:29:23.254 --> 02:29:23.988
AT LEAST IN OUR AREA WE

02:29:24.055 --> 02:29:25.890
PATROLLED FOR FIFTY DAYS THIS

02:29:25.956 --> 02:29:26.891
YEAR LEVY PATROL WHEN WE GET

02:29:26.957 --> 02:29:28.292
SEAT ACT AND WE HAVE A SPECIFIC

02:29:28.359 --> 02:29:29.460
NUMBER WE GOT A LEVY PATROL WE

02:29:29.527 --> 02:29:30.594
PATROLLED FOR FIFTY DAYS THAT'S

02:29:30.661 --> 02:29:34.065
ONLY TWO DAYS LESS THAN IN.

02:29:34.131 --> 02:29:34.699
TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE'VE EXCEEDED

02:29:34.765 --> 02:29:36.400
OUR OUR EMERGENCY PATROL BUDGET

02:29:36.467 --> 02:29:38.936
BY THREE TIMES -- AND SO FAR WE

02:29:39.003 --> 02:29:40.271
DON'T HAVE AN A FEDERAL DISASTER

02:29:40.338 --> 02:29:42.139
DECLARATION SO IN TWENTY

02:29:42.206 --> 02:29:42.807
SEVENTEEN WE WERE ABLE TO RECOUP

02:29:42.873 --> 02:29:44.575
A LOT OF THOSE CONTROL COSTS WE

02:29:44.642 --> 02:29:46.377
DON'T HAVE A MECHANISM. TO

02:29:46.444 --> 02:29:48.612
RECOUP THOSE COSTS SO THAT'S

02:29:48.679 --> 02:29:49.213
JUST LESS MAINTENANCE THAT WE

02:29:49.280 --> 02:29:50.348
CAN DO.

02:29:50.414 --> 02:29:52.383
I'M THE CORE IS ALSO NOT OPENS

02:29:52.450 --> 02:29:53.317
THE P. ONLY FOUR NINETY NINE

02:29:53.384 --> 02:29:54.852
PROGRAM YET THIS YEAR WE DON'T

02:29:54.919 --> 02:29:56.554
KNOW IF THEY WILL OR NOT -- BUT

02:29:56.620 --> 02:29:58.589
ALL THOSE DAMAGES MAY NOT HAVE

02:29:58.656 --> 02:30:00.257
FEDERAL ASSISTANCE THAT WE CAN

02:30:00.324 --> 02:30:01.525
REACH INTO AND SO WHAT DOES THAT

02:30:01.592 --> 02:30:03.294
MEAN THAT MORE FINANCIAL BURDEN

02:30:03.361 --> 02:30:04.595
ON THE STATE AND LOCALS.

02:30:04.662 --> 02:30:06.063
BECAUSE THE DAMAGE IS GOING TO

02:30:06.130 --> 02:30:10.601
HAVE TO GET FIXED -- SO.

02:30:10.668 --> 02:30:11.669
YOU KNOW I I CAN'T WE CAN'T LOSE

02:30:11.736 --> 02:30:12.636
SIGHT OF THE FACT THAT THERE'S

02:30:12.703 --> 02:30:14.739
GOING TO BE DAMAGE MORE DAMAGE

02:30:14.805 --> 02:30:16.273
AND WE ALREADY HAVE A BACKLOG OF

02:30:16.340 --> 02:30:19.009
DAMAGE FROM -- TWENTY SEVENTEEN

02:30:19.076 --> 02:30:19.677
SO AS MELINDA STATED THAT YOUNG

02:30:19.744 --> 02:30:20.811
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF INVESTMENT

02:30:20.878 --> 02:30:22.346
IN THE URBAN AREAS.

02:30:22.413 --> 02:30:23.914
WE'VE MADE GREAT PROGRESS THE

02:30:23.981 --> 02:30:27.385
SYSTEMS HAS REALLY REALLY WORKED --

02:30:27.451 --> 02:30:28.719
BUT WE NEED TO WORK TOGETHER TO

02:30:28.786 --> 02:30:31.522
FIX THE OUTSTANDING STORM DAMAGE --

02:30:31.589 --> 02:30:33.023
IF WE WAIT THEY JUST GET MORE

02:30:33.090 --> 02:30:34.191
EXPENSIVE THEY DON'T GET THEIR

02:30:34.258 --> 02:30:35.726
ON THEIR OWN IT JUST GETS MORE

02:30:35.793 --> 02:30:36.894
EXPENSIVE.

02:30:36.961 --> 02:30:37.962
AND WE ALSO NEED TO GET AHEAD OF

02:30:38.028 --> 02:30:39.597
THE NEXT DISASTER AND LOOK

02:30:39.663 --> 02:30:40.998
FORWARD TO WHAT'S NEXT --

02:30:41.065 --> 02:30:42.466
PROTECTING OUR SMALL COMMUNITIES

02:30:42.533 --> 02:30:44.301
AGRICULTURAL AREAS THE THAT

02:30:44.368 --> 02:30:46.737
COMMUNITIES SUPPORT AGRICULTURE

02:30:46.804 --> 02:30:48.973
IS KEY -- WE REALLY NEED TO

02:30:49.039 --> 02:30:53.210
FOCUS ON THAT AS THE NEXT AREA --

02:30:53.277 --> 02:30:54.211
SO WE CAN'T TAKE CARE OF THE

02:30:54.278 --> 02:30:55.513
FLOOD INFRASTRUCTURE ALONE THE

02:30:55.579 --> 02:30:57.281
ELEMENTS CAN ONLY DO SO MUCH AND

02:30:57.348 --> 02:30:58.749
WE NEED TO WORK TOGETHER AS THE

02:30:58.816 --> 02:31:00.451
STATE AND LOCALS AND THEN WE

02:31:00.518 --> 02:31:02.520
NEED TO RELY ON EACH OTHER. TO

02:31:02.586 --> 02:31:04.555
EFFECTIVELY MANAGE THE SYSTEM --

02:31:04.622 --> 02:31:06.157
OUR INVOLVEMENT AT THE LANDOWNER

02:31:06.223 --> 02:31:07.992
LEVEL BRINGS A FORM OF COST

02:31:08.058 --> 02:31:09.193
EFFICIENCY.

02:31:09.260 --> 02:31:11.262
TRUST IN ACCESS THE JUST THE

02:31:11.328 --> 02:31:12.096
STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

02:31:12.163 --> 02:31:14.098
JUST CAN'T GET -- THE AMOUNT OF

02:31:14.165 --> 02:31:16.600
TRUST THAT ARE LOCALS HAVE WITH

02:31:16.667 --> 02:31:19.770
THE R. D. IS -- IS IT'S HUGE AND

02:31:19.837 --> 02:31:23.107
AND SO WE CAN PROVIDE THAT.

02:31:23.174 --> 02:31:25.209
AVENUE FOR THE LOCALS AND AND

02:31:25.276 --> 02:31:26.444
EXPLAIN TO THEM THE STATE AND

02:31:26.510 --> 02:31:28.512
FEDERAL PROGRAMS AND ALSO BE THE

02:31:28.579 --> 02:31:30.014
VOICE BACK TO THE STATE AND

02:31:30.080 --> 02:31:31.482
FEDERAL AGENCIES.

02:31:31.549 --> 02:31:32.817
SO WE HAVE TO MOVE FORWARD IN

02:31:32.883 --> 02:31:35.219
SYNC ALLOWING US TO BE MORE

02:31:35.286 --> 02:31:38.456
SUCCESSFUL AND WERE ALWAYS -- WE

02:31:38.522 --> 02:31:39.490
WE'VE DO WE'VE DONE A GREAT JOB

02:31:39.557 --> 02:31:40.758
OF COLLABORATING MORE BUT YOU

02:31:40.825 --> 02:31:42.293
CAN ALWAYS DO MORE SO WE CAN

02:31:42.359 --> 02:31:44.228
ALWAYS DO BETTER AND KEEP MOVING

02:31:44.295 --> 02:31:45.696
FORWARD AND TRYING.

02:31:45.763 --> 02:31:47.898
TO ACT AS ONE RATHER THAN A

02:31:47.965 --> 02:31:49.366
WHOLE BUNCH OF DIFFERENT

02:31:49.433 --> 02:31:52.369
ENTITIES -- WE NEED TO CONTINUE

02:31:52.436 --> 02:31:53.337
INVESTING IN EMERGENCY

02:31:53.404 --> 02:31:55.606
PREPAREDNESS -- AS I SAID IT THE

02:31:55.673 --> 02:31:57.274
PLANNING THAT WAS DONE IN OUR

02:31:57.341 --> 02:32:01.512
REGION -- WAS PHENOMENAL -- BUT

02:32:01.579 --> 02:32:03.047
IT IF YOU DON'T PRACTICE IF YOU

02:32:03.113 --> 02:32:04.882
DON'T TRAIN IT GOES STALE SO WE

02:32:04.949 --> 02:32:06.150
WILL HAVE ANOTHER ROUND OF

02:32:06.217 --> 02:32:07.618
EMERGENCY RESPONSE GRANT WE WILL

02:32:07.685 --> 02:32:09.019
KEEP THAT GOING IN OUR REGION

02:32:09.086 --> 02:32:12.723
BUT THAT'S CRITICAL TO KEEP UP --

02:32:12.790 --> 02:32:14.291
AND WE NEED TO CONVINCE CONTINUE

02:32:14.358 --> 02:32:15.359
INVESTING IN OUR DEFERRED

02:32:15.426 --> 02:32:16.727
MAINTENANCE AND AS LESLIE SAID

02:32:16.794 --> 02:32:17.962
TAKING CARE OF WHAT WE HAVE

02:32:18.028 --> 02:32:19.597
WE'VE WE'VE GOT TO TAKE CARE OF

02:32:19.663 --> 02:32:21.699
WHAT WE HAVE -- SUPPORTING THE

02:32:21.765 --> 02:32:23.400
NEW PROGRAMS THAT HELP THE FLOOD

02:32:23.467 --> 02:32:25.035
MAINTENANCE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM

02:32:25.102 --> 02:32:25.603
IN THE FLOOD SYSTEM REPAIR

02:32:25.669 --> 02:32:27.304
PROGRAM THOSE ARE TWO HUGE

02:32:27.371 --> 02:32:29.640
PROGRAMS -- THAT THE STATE HAS

02:32:29.707 --> 02:32:31.642
PUT TOGETHER THAT WILL ALLOW US

02:32:31.709 --> 02:32:33.177
TO ADDRESS A LOT OF THAT

02:32:33.244 --> 02:32:35.880
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE -- AND SO

02:32:35.946 --> 02:32:38.282
WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE

02:32:38.349 --> 02:32:40.084
WORKING TOWARDS THOSE PLANS AND

02:32:40.150 --> 02:32:42.019
ULTIMATELY SO WE CAN REMAIN

02:32:42.086 --> 02:32:42.553
ELIGIBLE FOR THAT FEDERAL

02:32:42.620 --> 02:32:43.554
FUNDING.

02:32:43.621 --> 02:32:44.655
IF WE DON'T CONTINUE TO MOVE

02:32:44.722 --> 02:32:45.756
FORARD AND WE DON'T SHOW

02:32:45.823 --> 02:32:47.358
PROGRESS.

02:32:47.424 --> 02:32:49.226
GUESS WHAT WHAT WE BECOME AN

02:32:49.293 --> 02:32:51.395
ELIGIBLE AGAIN NO MORE FORTY

02:32:51.462 --> 02:32:53.430
MILLION DOLLARS RIGHT -- AND SO

02:32:53.497 --> 02:32:54.899
INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT AS

02:32:54.965 --> 02:32:56.500

COMMUNITIES YOU KNOW THE URBAN

02:33:05.609 --> 02:33:07.111
INVESTMENTS HAVE BEEN A SUCCESS

02:33:07.177 --> 02:33:09.513
AND IT'S TIME TO TO MOVE TO OUR

02:33:09.580 --> 02:33:11.081
SMALL COMMUNITY IS THE NEXT BIG

02:33:11.148 --> 02:33:12.783
LIABILITY FOR THE STATE --

02:33:12.850 --> 02:33:14.118
BECAUSE THERE ARE ALSO

02:33:14.184 --> 02:33:17.688

RISK FOR OUR OUR LANDOWNER

02:33:36.674 --> 02:33:38.309
ANYTIME WE REDUCE RISK IT IT

02:33:38.375 --> 02:33:40.210
REDUCES THE STATE LIABILITY SO

OF FAIRING WHEN IT COMES TO MAX

02:36:00.984 --> 02:36:02.419
IS SEEN THE DOLLARS WERE EARLIER

WE TALKED ABOUT HOW MUCH.

02:36:03.821 --> 02:36:05.923
MONEY HAS BEEN INVESTED OVER THE

02:36:05.989 --> 02:36:07.424
LAST TWO DECADES.

02:36:07.491 --> 02:36:08.258
P. M..

02:36:08.325 --> 02:36:10.094
I DON'T THINK WOULD BE SURPRISED

02:36:10.160 --> 02:36:12.296
IF WE NARROWED DOWN HOW MUCH HAS

02:36:12.362 --> 02:36:14.264
GONE TO SOME OF THE SMALLER

02:36:14.331 --> 02:36:15.666
DISTRICTS IN.

02:36:15.733 --> 02:36:17.534

THESE DOLLARS AND CRITERIAS --

02:36:26.977 --> 02:36:28.011
WERE MAKING SURE THEY WERE

02:36:28.078 --> 02:36:30.948

MUCH JUST THE WORLD THE BIGGER --

02:36:37.855 --> 02:36:39.356
URBAN AREAS GET ALL THE MONEY

02:36:39.423 --> 02:36:41.525
LET LET'S GET MORE SPECIFIC TO

02:36:46.430 --> 02:36:48.031
I WILL SAY THAT AGAIN AFTER

02:36:48.098 --> 02:36:49.566
KATRINA AND THE LEGISLATURE DID

02:36:49.633 --> 02:36:51.001
THE LEGISLATION REQUIRING THE

02:36:51.068 --> 02:36:53.036
FLOOD PLAN -- THE OTHER THING IT

02:36:53.103 --> 02:36:54.972
REQUIRED WAS FOR THE URBAN AREAS

02:36:55.038 --> 02:36:56.306
IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY SYSTEM

02:36:56.373 --> 02:36:57.741
ANYWAY TO GET UP TO TO IT TO

02:36:57.808 --> 02:36:59.276
ENTER YOUR LEVEL OF PROTECTION

02:36:59.343 --> 02:37:00.677
BY.

02:37:00.744 --> 02:37:01.211
TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AND SO

02:37:01.278 --> 02:37:02.679
THEY'VE ALL THAT'S PART OF THE

02:37:02.746 --> 02:37:03.914
REASON WHY STATE FUNDING IN

02:37:03.981 --> 02:37:05.983
PARTICULAR WAS GOING TO THE

02:37:06.049 --> 02:37:07.918
TOWARDS THAT AREA BUT ALSO

02:37:07.985 --> 02:37:10.087
BECAUSE THAT IS WHERE THE HIGHER.

02:37:10.154 --> 02:37:12.856
RISK OF LOSS IS IF YOU WILL SO

02:37:12.923 --> 02:37:14.191
IT BUT WAS WITH THE INTENTION

02:37:14.258 --> 02:37:15.793
THAT YOU KNOW YOU YOU DO HAVE TO

02:37:15.859 --> 02:37:17.828
THEN TAKE EVERY OTHER PARTS OF

02:37:17.895 --> 02:37:19.563
THE SYSTEM -- THE FEDERAL

02:37:19.630 --> 02:37:20.597
GOVERNMENT DOES A LITTLE BIT OF

02:37:20.664 --> 02:37:21.865
THE SIMILAR THING WE'VE SEEN

02:37:21.932 --> 02:37:23.200
THAT SOMETIMES OF THE NEWER

02:37:23.267 --> 02:37:24.735
PROJECTS ARE WANTING TO DO.

02:37:24.802 --> 02:37:27.337
ARE IN THE URBAN AREAS AND

02:37:27.404 --> 02:37:28.672
TRYING TO GET TO THEIR COST

02:37:28.739 --> 02:37:31.375
BENEFIT RATIO THAT THEY REQUIRE

02:37:31.441 --> 02:37:32.910
FOR THESE RURAL AREAS IS IS

02:37:32.976 --> 02:37:34.511
SOMETIMES A LITTLE BIT MORE

02:37:34.578 --> 02:37:35.345
DIFFICULT.

02:37:35.412 --> 02:37:37.014
BUT I'M ON ALL IT MEGAN HIT UPON

02:37:37.080 --> 02:37:39.316
THAT I WILL SAY IN TERMS OF SOME

02:37:39.383 --> 02:37:40.517
OF THE STATE FUNDING PROGRAMS

02:37:40.584 --> 02:37:41.952
THAT ARE AVAILABLE IN THE DELTA.

02:37:42.019 --> 02:37:43.487
AS I MENTIONED FOR FORTY YEARS

02:37:43.554 --> 02:37:44.822
WE'VE HAD THE DELTA SUBVENTIONS

02:37:44.888 --> 02:37:46.890
PROGRAM FOR MAINTENANCE AND WE

02:37:46.957 --> 02:37:53.430
HAVE ONLY HAD TWO FAILURES IN

02:37:53.497 --> 02:37:54.031
THE LAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS AND

02:37:54.097 --> 02:37:55.399
NONE OF NEW FEELINGS FOR

02:37:55.465 --> 02:37:56.433
OVERTOPPING SINCE IT'S BEEN.

02:37:56.500 --> 02:37:57.701
IN PLACE -- AND AND WE DO HAVE

02:37:57.768 --> 02:37:58.836
THESE TWO NEW PROGRAMS JUST

02:37:58.902 --> 02:37:59.469
RECENTLY CREATED BY DEPARTMENT

02:37:59.536 --> 02:38:01.405
OF WATER RESOURCES THAT REALLY

02:38:01.471 --> 02:38:02.606
ARE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE

02:38:02.673 --> 02:38:05.509
RURAL AREAS -- TO START ACCESS

02:38:05.576 --> 02:38:07.611
SCENE AND I AGAIN A LET ME AGAIN

02:38:07.678 --> 02:38:08.979
MAYBE YOU'VE HAD ON HOW THEY USE

02:38:09.046 --> 02:38:11.315
THAT BUT THAT'S THOSE ARE THE

02:38:11.381 --> 02:38:13.717
USEFUL FUNDING TOOLS.

02:38:13.784 --> 02:38:15.819
BUT THEY NEED TO BE FUNDED.

02:38:15.886 --> 02:38:16.286
SO I THINK SOME OF THE

02:38:16.353 --> 02:38:19.523
CHALLENGES -- AT MIL MELINDA

02:38:19.590 --> 02:38:20.657
MENTION THE TWO EIGHTEEN

02:38:20.724 --> 02:38:22.125
ELECTION PROCESS RATE THAT

02:38:22.192 --> 02:38:25.562
CREATES A CHALLENGE -- IN.

02:38:25.629 --> 02:38:27.097
IN BRINGING IN THE ASSESSMENTS

02:38:27.164 --> 02:38:28.098
AND ESPECIALLY IN OVERLAPPING

02:38:28.165 --> 02:38:29.700
DISTRICTS SO I MENTIONED THAT

02:38:29.766 --> 02:38:30.801
I'M DEPUTY MANAGER FOR THREE

02:38:30.868 --> 02:38:32.169
DISTRICTS WILL LOT OF THOSE

02:38:32.236 --> 02:38:33.437
LANDOWNERS OF THE SAME.

02:38:33.503 --> 02:38:34.872
SO THEY HAVE OVERLAPPING

02:38:34.938 --> 02:38:38.108
ASSESSMENTS FOR LEVY MAINTENANCE --

02:38:38.175 --> 02:38:39.877
ON TOP OF THAT YOU'VE -- WE'VE

02:38:39.943 --> 02:38:43.547
ADDED THE CIGNA THE GROUND WATER.

02:38:43.614 --> 02:38:44.314
ACT WHICH IS IT ANOTHER

02:38:44.381 --> 02:38:45.782
ASSESSMENT THAT'S GOING TO BE

02:38:45.849 --> 02:38:46.817
LAID UPON.

02:38:46.884 --> 02:38:49.319
THE SAME LANDOWNERS AND THEN

02:38:49.386 --> 02:38:50.220
WE'VE -- THIS IS A REALLY FUN

02:38:50.287 --> 02:38:52.256
PROTECTION BOARD IS LOOKING AT

02:38:52.322 --> 02:38:52.823
THE SACRAMENTO SEEM LOOKING

02:38:52.890 --> 02:38:54.291
DRAINAGE DISTRICT WHICH IS

02:38:54.358 --> 02:38:55.626
POTENTIALLY ANOTHER ASSESSMENT.

02:38:55.692 --> 02:38:57.494
SO IS IS ALL OF THESE

02:38:57.561 --> 02:38:59.096
ASSESSMENTS GET BUILT ON EACH

02:38:59.162 --> 02:39:04.334
OTHER IT BECOMES LESS AND LESS --

02:39:04.401 --> 02:39:05.135
IT WERE LESS ABLE TO GENERATE

02:39:05.202 --> 02:39:07.070
LOCAL DOLLARS BECAUSE THEY THEY

02:39:07.137 --> 02:39:07.504
JUST.

02:39:07.571 --> 02:39:09.006
THERE SOME YOU MIGHT THEY CAN

02:39:09.072 --> 02:39:09.773
VOTE NO.

02:39:09.840 --> 02:39:10.240
RIGHT.

02:39:10.307 --> 02:39:12.976
AND SO THAT'S THAT'S REALLY

02:39:13.043 --> 02:39:15.112
DIFFICULT. TO TO BE ABLE TO GET

02:39:15.178 --> 02:39:16.079
YOUR ASSESSMENT THROUGH AND IN

02:39:16.146 --> 02:39:18.615
SOME AREAS -- REGULATORY

02:39:18.682 --> 02:39:20.450
REQUIREMENTS I MEAN REGULATORY

02:39:20.517 --> 02:39:22.252
REQUIREMENTS ARE SIGNIFICANT

02:39:22.319 --> 02:39:24.922
COST AND SO FOR FOR A LOT OF THE

02:39:24.988 --> 02:39:28.926
COSTS AND WITH REGULATORY --

02:39:28.992 --> 02:39:31.862
ELEMENTS IS IS A DOLLAR LESS IN

02:39:31.929 --> 02:39:33.130
IN MAINTENANCE AND WE'RE SEEING

02:39:33.196 --> 02:39:35.198
IN SOME OF WE'RE YOU KNOW WE'RE

02:39:35.265 --> 02:39:37.067
FOCUSING A LOT ON TIGHT.

02:39:37.134 --> 02:39:38.535
REPLACEMENTS AND PIPE PICTURE A

02:39:38.602 --> 02:39:40.037
BIG RESTORE LEVEES THEIR OLD

02:39:40.103 --> 02:39:41.805
RIGHT NOW THE SYSTEM IS OLD --

02:39:41.872 --> 02:39:43.106
THERE ARE SOME TYPES THAT YOU

02:39:43.173 --> 02:39:44.474
THE ONLY WAY TO REMEDY IS TO

02:39:44.541 --> 02:39:46.376
TAKE THEM OUT AND THE COST OF

02:39:46.443 --> 02:39:48.145
DOING ALL OF THE PERMITTING.

02:39:48.211 --> 02:39:50.747
EQUALS THE COST OF REPLACING THE

02:39:50.814 --> 02:39:51.615
PIE.

02:39:51.682 --> 02:39:53.684
AND SO IT IT THOSE CHALLENGES

02:39:53.750 --> 02:39:55.118
JUST MAKE IT HARD FOR A LOCAL

02:39:55.185 --> 02:39:57.654
DISTRICT TO EFFICIENTLY.

02:39:57.721 --> 02:39:59.790
OPERATE AND MAINTAIN -- THEIR

02:39:59.856 --> 02:40:01.358
SYSTEM.

02:40:01.425 --> 02:40:04.394
SO AT SOME POINT WILL BE ASKED

02:40:04.461 --> 02:40:06.463
TO CONSIDER ANOTHER WATER BOND

02:40:06.530 --> 02:40:07.397
INFRASTRUCTURE RIGHT.

02:40:07.464 --> 02:40:09.633
AT SOME POINT.

02:40:09.700 --> 02:40:11.668
IF YOU WERE WRITING IT BUT WHAT

02:40:11.735 --> 02:40:14.538
WOULD THOSE MAYBE TOP.

02:40:14.604 --> 02:40:16.773
THREE CRITERIAS LOOK LIKE -- NOT

02:40:16.840 --> 02:40:18.008
CONSIDERING THAT YOU PROBABLY

02:40:18.075 --> 02:40:19.543
WOULD SAY I WANT TO DIRECT ON

02:40:19.609 --> 02:40:20.577
OCCASION.

02:40:20.644 --> 02:40:22.112
TO THESE DISTRICTS RIGHT BUT

02:40:22.179 --> 02:40:24.881
WHAT WOULD BE KIND OF THE TO BE.

02:40:24.948 --> 02:40:26.249
TOP CRITERIAS THAT YOU FEEL

02:40:26.316 --> 02:40:29.619
WOULD ALLOW DISTRICTS LIKE YOURS

02:40:29.686 --> 02:40:31.355
TO TO COMPETE WELL RIGHT TO FOR

02:40:31.421 --> 02:40:32.222
OFF.

02:40:32.289 --> 02:40:34.391
WELL IT WITHIN THE A DISTRICTS

02:40:34.458 --> 02:40:38.628
OF SIMILAR YOU KNOW NATURE SO.

02:40:38.695 --> 02:40:39.229
TO HEAR THAT YOUR THOUGHTS ON

02:40:39.296 --> 02:40:42.132
THAT -- SO.

02:40:42.199 --> 02:40:43.600
AT THE DISTRICTS HERE EVERY

02:40:43.667 --> 02:40:45.002
DISTRICTS IN A LITTLE DIFFERENT

02:40:45.068 --> 02:40:47.037
FINANCIAL SITUATION I THINK WE

02:40:47.104 --> 02:40:49.272
NEED -- TO WE NEED TO POSITION

02:40:49.339 --> 02:40:51.208
OURSELVES BETTER TO BE ABLE TO

02:40:51.274 --> 02:40:52.442
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ALL OF THE

02:40:52.509 --> 02:40:53.944
DIFFERENT FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES

02:40:54.011 --> 02:40:56.513
THAT COME -- YOU KNOW I'M WE

02:40:56.580 --> 02:40:59.583
DON'T DO A LOT OF PREPARING WE

02:40:59.649 --> 02:41:00.751
KNOW WHAT OUR DAMAGE STAR ARE

02:41:00.817 --> 02:41:01.818
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE SITE SORRY

02:41:01.885 --> 02:41:04.688
WE KNOW WHAT'S OUT THERE.

02:41:04.755 --> 02:41:06.189
AND IF WE HAD -- THE ABILITY TO

02:41:06.256 --> 02:41:08.925
ACCESS STATE FUNDS NOW TO BE

02:41:08.992 --> 02:41:10.260
ABLE TO PREPARE AND PERMIT AND

02:41:10.327 --> 02:41:11.762
IN DESIGN A LOT OF THOSE THINGS

02:41:11.828 --> 02:41:13.330
WHEN ALL OF THESE OPPORTUNITIES

02:41:13.397 --> 02:41:14.297
COME UP.

02:41:14.364 --> 02:41:17.501
YOU CAN JUMP ON IT -- THE FEMALE

02:41:17.567 --> 02:41:18.502
HAS THE HAZARD MITIGATION GRANT

02:41:18.568 --> 02:41:20.837
PROGRAM THAT YOU KNOW FOR EVERY

02:41:20.904 --> 02:41:23.373
DOLLAR THEY ISSUE IN -- PUBLIC

02:41:23.440 --> 02:41:24.908
ASSISTANCE THE STATE GETS A

02:41:24.975 --> 02:41:26.176
CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY BACK

02:41:26.243 --> 02:41:27.411
THAT WE CAN DO MITIGATION.

02:41:27.477 --> 02:41:28.745
YOU KNOW WHAT WE APPLIED FOR ONE

02:41:28.812 --> 02:41:30.380
OF THOSE ACTUALLY GOT IT WE WE

02:41:30.447 --> 02:41:31.348
WERE TOLD WE WERE.

02:41:31.415 --> 02:41:33.216
GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET IT WE WE

02:41:33.283 --> 02:41:34.017
TRIED WE HAD TO DECLINE BECAUSE

02:41:34.084 --> 02:41:36.586
WE ARE THE PROJECTS WE THINK

02:41:36.653 --> 02:41:38.688
WE'RE GONNA GET IT -- BUT IT

02:41:38.755 --> 02:41:40.290
SHOWED THAT WE CAN.

02:41:40.357 --> 02:41:41.925
AS LONG AS WE'RE PREPARED.

02:41:41.992 --> 02:41:44.594
AND SO IF WE CAN PREPARE IF WE

02:41:44.661 --> 02:41:46.496
CAN POSITION OURSELVES AND BE

02:41:46.563 --> 02:41:47.898
BETTER STRATEGICALLY PLACED TO

02:41:47.964 --> 02:41:49.566
ACCESS ALL OF THOSE GRANTS WE

02:41:49.633 --> 02:41:51.802
CAN BETTER LEVERAGE BOTH STATE

02:41:51.868 --> 02:41:54.304
AND FEDERAL MONEY.

02:41:54.371 --> 02:41:55.639
I'M I ANSWERED A LITTLE BIT

02:41:55.705 --> 02:41:56.940
DIFFERENTLY SO WHAT.

02:41:57.007 --> 02:41:58.442
MY MEMBERS WOULD SAY WE WERE

02:41:58.508 --> 02:41:59.776
PRIDE GO BACK TO THE WORDING

02:41:59.843 --> 02:42:01.745
THAT WAS IN THE FLOOD ONLY BOMB

02:42:01.812 --> 02:42:03.146
THE PROP.

02:42:03.213 --> 02:42:03.980
ONE EIGHTY BECAUSE IT HAD THE

02:42:04.047 --> 02:42:05.982
TYPES OF CATEGORIES OF THE TYPES

02:42:06.049 --> 02:42:07.484
OF THINGS THAT YOU WOULD WANT.

02:42:07.551 --> 02:42:09.152
TO YOU KNOW SPEND THE MONEY ON

02:42:09.219 --> 02:42:11.488
AND WHEN WE LOOK BACK YOU KNOW

02:42:11.555 --> 02:42:12.489
WHAT WAS ACCOMPLISHED WITH THAT

02:42:12.556 --> 02:42:14.124
ONE ANY YOU KNOW IT'S A LOT

02:42:14.191 --> 02:42:15.459
THESE NEWER BONDS ARE.

02:42:15.525 --> 02:42:16.860
HAVING DIFFERENT LANGUAGE AND

02:42:16.927 --> 02:42:18.061
KIND OF GOT AWAY FROM SOME OF

02:42:18.128 --> 02:42:20.163
THOSE CATEGORIES -- SO WE WOULD

02:42:20.230 --> 02:42:21.998
RECOMMEND REALLY LOOKING BACK AT

02:42:22.065 --> 02:42:23.400
THAT LANGUAGE.

02:42:23.467 --> 02:42:24.668
YEAH I THINK A LOT OF THE NEWER

02:42:24.734 --> 02:42:25.502
BONDS HAVE BEEN ALL MULTI

02:42:25.569 --> 02:42:27.471
BENEFIT.

02:42:27.537 --> 02:42:29.372
AND WHAT IN.

02:42:29.439 --> 02:42:30.240
OUR DISTRICT IS MULTI BENEFIT

02:42:30.307 --> 02:42:31.608
PROJECTS SO THOSE ARE GREAT BUT

02:42:31.675 --> 02:42:33.009
NOT EVERYTHING CAN BE SOMETIMES

02:42:33.076 --> 02:42:33.844
WE JUST HAVE FLOOD RISK

02:42:33.910 --> 02:42:35.045
REDUCTION PROJECTS THAT NEED TO

02:42:35.112 --> 02:42:37.080
BE DONE -- BUT AND THAT'S WHY I

02:42:37.147 --> 02:42:38.648
SAY THERE IS CATEGORIES THAT

02:42:38.715 --> 02:42:40.617
INCLUDED THE SYSTEM THAT THE

02:42:40.684 --> 02:42:43.286
STATE NEEDS TO WORRY ABOUT THEIR

02:42:43.353 --> 02:42:47.124
BY PASSES AND SUCH [inaudible]

02:42:47.190 --> 02:42:49.326
RESPOND.

02:42:49.392 --> 02:42:52.929
TO HERE IS H. U. EVALUATE --

02:42:52.996 --> 02:42:57.167
FLOOD RISK AND MITIGATION.

02:42:57.234 --> 02:43:00.270
ON FOOT PRESQUE. TWO CAN CIRCLE

02:43:00.337 --> 02:43:02.506
BACK TO SOME OF THE COMMENTS I

02:43:02.572 --> 02:43:05.075
GAVE YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION.

02:43:05.142 --> 02:43:06.309
MY CONTINUE FRUSTRATION THERE

02:43:06.376 --> 02:43:08.044
WATER POLICIES JUST TOTAL LACK

02:43:08.111 --> 02:43:12.582
OF COLLABORATION AND A TOTAL --

02:43:12.649 --> 02:43:14.684
LACK OF UNDERSTAND THAT.

02:43:14.751 --> 02:43:15.886
YOU KNOW THE RIGHT HAND LEFT AND

02:43:15.952 --> 02:43:17.020
NEED TO BE DOING THE TO BE

02:43:17.087 --> 02:43:17.954
COORDINATED.

02:43:18.021 --> 02:43:20.857
AND GIVEN EXAMPLE.

02:43:20.924 --> 02:43:22.392
WE PASSED THE GROUND WATER

02:43:22.459 --> 02:43:24.261
SUSTAINABILITY ACT.

02:43:24.327 --> 02:43:26.196
LEGISLATURE DRESS THE THE CRISIS

02:43:26.263 --> 02:43:27.297
FOLLOWING YOU KNOW EXTENDED

02:43:27.364 --> 02:43:28.465
PERIOD DROUGHT THAT WE HAD

02:43:28.532 --> 02:43:30.834
COLLAPSING AQUIFER'S THROUGHOUT

02:43:30.901 --> 02:43:31.468
CENTER I THROUGHOUT THE STATE.

02:43:31.535 --> 02:43:34.304
AND IN THAT VERY LEGISLATION WE

02:43:34.371 --> 02:43:37.240
PROHIBITED -- RECHARGE OF GROUND

02:43:37.307 --> 02:43:39.376
WATER AS A BENEFICIAL USE FOR

02:43:39.442 --> 02:43:41.378
DISTRICTS ACTUALLY PUT WATER --

02:43:41.444 --> 02:43:43.446
INTO THE GROUND OBVIOUSLY THAT

02:43:43.513 --> 02:43:45.682
DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE -- NOW

02:43:45.749 --> 02:43:47.584
THERE'S A LOT OF POLITICS BEHIND

02:43:47.651 --> 02:43:49.019
THAT POLICIES ARE HAS TO DO WITH

02:43:49.085 --> 02:43:50.687
URBAN AREAS WANT THEIR CAKE AND

02:43:50.754 --> 02:43:52.055
EAT IT TOO AS FAR AS GETTING

02:43:52.122 --> 02:43:53.924
THEIR WATER DOWN. TO THE URBAN

02:43:53.990 --> 02:43:55.559
AREAS AND IF YOU GOT A BUNCH OF

02:43:55.625 --> 02:43:56.560
RURAL.

02:43:56.626 --> 02:43:58.762
DISTRICTS PUTTING WATER INTO THE

02:43:58.828 --> 02:44:00.597
GROUND IT'S NOT MOVING -- SOUTH

02:44:00.664 --> 02:44:02.165
SO THERE'S REASONS FOR THOSE

02:44:02.232 --> 02:44:03.867
DECISIONS BUT THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY

02:44:03.934 --> 02:44:04.901
SOMEWHAT HYPOCRITICAL

02:44:04.968 --> 02:44:06.269
INCONSISTENT BUT MORE

02:44:06.336 --> 02:44:11.508
IMPORTANTLY TO ME FLOOD RISK AND

02:44:11.575 --> 02:44:13.109
WATER SUPPLY ART.

02:44:13.176 --> 02:44:14.811
DISCONNECTED RIGHT AND WHAT'S

02:44:14.878 --> 02:44:15.445
INTERESTING BOTH IN THE PANEL

02:44:15.512 --> 02:44:17.280
THAT WE HAD BEFORE THIS PANEL

02:44:17.347 --> 02:44:18.048
AND IN DURING THIS PANEL IS.

02:44:18.114 --> 02:44:19.482
THERE'S NOT A LOT OF THERE'S

02:44:19.549 --> 02:44:21.184
TALK ABOUT COLLABORATION BUT I'M

02:44:21.251 --> 02:44:23.820
NOT SURE WE'VE GOT SHARED GOALS.

02:44:23.887 --> 02:44:25.555
IF THAT MAKES SENSE AND AND I

02:44:25.622 --> 02:44:27.591
KIND OF WONDER HOW.

02:44:27.657 --> 02:44:29.492
HOW COULD WE TAKE THOSE OTHER

02:44:29.559 --> 02:44:32.162
CONSIDERATIONS INTO AFFECTS THE

02:44:32.229 --> 02:44:32.762
WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT FLOOD

02:44:32.829 --> 02:44:34.831
RISK AND I WAS LOOKING FOR

02:44:34.898 --> 02:44:36.399
EXAMPLE TO LA OWES?

02:44:36.466 --> 02:44:38.802
HAND OUT -- FROM EARLIER TALKS

02:44:38.868 --> 02:44:41.905
ABOUT YOU KNOW FLOOD RISK IN A

02:44:41.972 --> 02:44:42.973
IT BREAKS DOWN OR YOU KNOW

02:44:43.039 --> 02:44:44.307
NUMBER OF RESIDENTS NUMBER OF

02:44:44.374 --> 02:44:45.976
STRUCTURES CROP VALUE.

02:44:46.042 --> 02:44:46.943
RIGHT.

02:44:47.010 --> 02:44:48.812
WELL IF YOU TAKE THE SACRAMENTO

02:44:48.878 --> 02:44:51.181
RIVER THE SAN JOAQUIN AND TULARE

02:44:51.248 --> 02:44:52.849
LAKE JUST JUST THOSE.

02:44:52.916 --> 02:44:53.750
THREE YOU'VE GOT A COLLECTIVE

02:44:53.817 --> 02:44:58.255
CROP VALUE OF ALMOST SIX BILLION

02:44:58.321 --> 02:44:59.289
DOLLARS.

02:44:59.356 --> 02:45:00.390
THE ENTIRETY OF THE REST THE

02:45:00.457 --> 02:45:01.725
STATE HAS A CROP VALUE OF ONE

02:45:01.791 --> 02:45:03.093
POINT.

02:45:03.159 --> 02:45:05.195
FIVE RIGHT -- SO WE'RE TALK

02:45:05.262 --> 02:45:06.997
ABOUT CROP VALUE. EIGHT AND OF

02:45:07.063 --> 02:45:08.565
COURSE FOOD SUPPLY AND WHAT THAT

02:45:08.632 --> 02:45:10.367
MEANS LONG TERM -- AND THAT'S

02:45:10.433 --> 02:45:14.537
ALSO A SAFETY AND SECURITY ISSUE --

02:45:14.604 --> 02:45:15.905
THAT'S ARE WE TAKING INTO

02:45:15.972 --> 02:45:17.574
CONSIDERATION NECESSARILY IT

02:45:17.641 --> 02:45:19.376
SOUNDS LIKE IT SO I GUESS HOW DO

02:45:19.442 --> 02:45:21.077
WE WHAT CAN WE DO AS A

02:45:21.144 --> 02:45:22.979
LEGISLATURE TO ASSIST.

02:45:23.046 --> 02:45:24.147
YOU TO ASSIST YOU HAVE YOU ARE

02:45:24.214 --> 02:45:25.148
TO ASSIST.

02:45:25.215 --> 02:45:26.583
YOU KNOW THE WATER COMMISSION I

02:45:26.650 --> 02:45:28.184
MEAN EVEN THE FACT THAT WE HAVE

02:45:28.251 --> 02:45:29.452
A WATER BORDER WATER COMMISSION

02:45:29.519 --> 02:45:31.588
D. W. R. FLOOD CONTROL AND

02:45:31.655 --> 02:45:32.622
EVERYTHING'S IN A DIFFERENT

02:45:32.689 --> 02:45:33.990
PLACE RIGHT SO.

02:45:34.057 --> 02:45:35.458
FROM THE LAY PERSON'S

02:45:35.525 --> 02:45:36.660
PERSPECTIVE THE LEGISLATIVE

02:45:36.726 --> 02:45:38.461
PERSPECTIVE IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE

02:45:38.528 --> 02:45:39.963
TO SYSTEMS EVEN SET UP FOR A LOT

02:45:40.030 --> 02:45:41.498
OF COLLABORATION SO IT SEEMS

02:45:41.564 --> 02:45:42.899
LIKE THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO DO

02:45:42.966 --> 02:45:44.334
I REALIZE THAT WAS ALL ALARM.

02:45:44.401 --> 02:45:48.171
QUESTION WITH A LOT TO UNPACK

02:45:48.238 --> 02:45:49.873
BUT I HAVE THE SAME THOUGHTS ALL

02:45:49.939 --> 02:45:50.473
THE TIME AND THE REASON IS THE

02:45:50.540 --> 02:45:51.775
OTHER HAT THAT I WEAR IS I'M

02:45:51.841 --> 02:45:52.409
ALSO THE MANAGER OF THE NORTH.

02:45:52.475 --> 02:45:54.010
DELTA WATER AGENCIES SO WE DEAL

02:45:54.077 --> 02:45:55.845
WITH WATER SUPPLY ISSUES AND SO

02:45:55.912 --> 02:45:57.647
I GO TO MEETINGS FOR ABOUT FIVE

02:45:57.714 --> 02:45:59.449
MEANT WATER SUPPLY TAKE MEETINGS

02:45:59.516 --> 02:46:00.450
AND MATT FLED.

02:46:00.517 --> 02:46:01.918
AND AND I USED TO WORK RESOURCES

02:46:01.985 --> 02:46:03.420
AGENCY AND I'M LIKE YOU I JUST

02:46:03.486 --> 02:46:05.789
KEEP IN MY MIND I KEEP THINKING

02:46:05.855 --> 02:46:07.457
WHY ARE WE MAKING THESE

02:46:07.524 --> 02:46:09.359
SYNERGIZE TOGETHER BECAUSE THERE

02:46:09.426 --> 02:46:11.995
CAN BE COMPLETELY COMPLEMENTARY.

02:46:12.062 --> 02:46:13.096
AND IN SOME RESPECTS WE DO

02:46:13.163 --> 02:46:13.997
BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THE REST

02:46:14.064 --> 02:46:15.298
RESERVOIRS PROVIDE BOTH FLOOD

02:46:15.365 --> 02:46:19.235
CONTROL AND WATER SUPPLY BUT YOU

02:46:19.302 --> 02:46:20.970
KNOW YOU LOOK AT DID OF YOU ARE

02:46:21.037 --> 02:46:22.472
THEY DO HAVE TO THE DEPUTY

02:46:22.539 --> 02:46:24.107
DIRECTORS YOU KNOW ONES WATER

02:46:24.174 --> 02:46:26.042
SUPPLY AND YOU NO ONE'S GOT ALL

02:46:26.109 --> 02:46:27.444
THE OTHER INTEGRATED MANAGEMENT

02:46:27.510 --> 02:46:28.211
WHICH I THINK.

02:46:28.278 --> 02:46:31.381
INCLUDES YOU KNOW FLOOD CONTROL --

02:46:31.448 --> 02:46:33.183
AND SO I YOU KNOW I THINK.

02:46:33.249 --> 02:46:34.551
I I THOUGHT BY WHERE STRUGGLE

02:46:34.617 --> 02:46:35.418
WITH WHAT YOU BROUGHT UP IS I

02:46:35.485 --> 02:46:36.086
AGREE WITH EVERYTHING HE SAID I

02:46:36.152 --> 02:46:37.587
THINK ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME AND

02:46:37.654 --> 02:46:38.755
I THINK THE DEPARTMENT WOULD AT

02:46:38.822 --> 02:46:39.789
LEAST ACKNOWLEDGE.

02:46:39.856 --> 02:46:41.291
YOU CAN ALWAYS IMPROVE YOUR

02:46:41.358 --> 02:46:43.126
COORDINATION INTERNALLY YOU KNOW

02:46:43.193 --> 02:46:45.328
AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THESE I

02:46:45.395 --> 02:46:47.530
THINK LIKE ANYONE WERE WE GET

02:46:47.597 --> 02:46:50.300
CAUGHT UP AND WE GET STUCK ON

02:46:50.367 --> 02:46:51.701
HAVING TO RESPOND. TO THE

02:46:51.768 --> 02:46:54.070
EMERGENCIES OUR WATER SUPPLY

02:46:54.137 --> 02:46:56.940
SIDE THE DROUGHTS COME IN NO

02:46:57.006 --> 02:46:58.174
CENTERS OUT DROP CAM I GUARANTEE

02:46:58.241 --> 02:46:59.275
YOU WHAT COMES RIGHT AFTERWARDS

02:46:59.342 --> 02:46:59.943
AS THE FLOOD.

02:47:00.009 --> 02:47:01.511
YOU KNOW AND SO AS A DEPARTMENT

02:47:01.578 --> 02:47:03.246
WE SEE THAT THE INTERNALLY THEIR

02:47:03.313 --> 02:47:04.114
STAFF.

02:47:04.180 --> 02:47:05.382
THAT MIGHT EVEN WORKING FLOOD

02:47:05.448 --> 02:47:07.317
OPERATIONS HAS TO GO WORK ON

02:47:07.384 --> 02:47:08.184
SOME DROUGHT STUFF FOR A FEW

02:47:08.251 --> 02:47:09.719
YEARS AND THE ONE THAT'S OVER

02:47:09.786 --> 02:47:11.621
THE FLOOD DOES COME NOW PEOPLE

02:47:11.688 --> 02:47:12.522
CHANGE.

02:47:12.589 --> 02:47:14.357
AND SO WERE OFTEN REACTING AND

02:47:14.424 --> 02:47:16.126
NOT HAVING I THINK AS MUCH TIME

02:47:16.192 --> 02:47:19.362
AND ABILITY TO YOU KNOW FOCUS ON

02:47:19.429 --> 02:47:21.197
THE OKAY NOW WE HAVE WHAT WE

02:47:21.264 --> 02:47:22.565
HAVE HOW DO WE REALLY START

02:47:22.632 --> 02:47:23.433
MAKING IT WORK TOGETHER.

02:47:23.500 --> 02:47:24.801
I DO THINK THAT'S PART OF THEIR

02:47:24.868 --> 02:47:25.935
INTEGRATED MANAGEMENT IF YOU

02:47:26.002 --> 02:47:28.204
WILL IT IS ON THEIR MIND AS PART

02:47:28.271 --> 02:47:29.305
OF THEIR WATER PLAN THEY THEY

02:47:29.372 --> 02:47:35.745
CERTAINLY ACKNOWLEDGE IT

02:47:35.812 --> 02:47:38.915
UNDERSTAND IT -- THEY THERE YET

02:47:38.982 --> 02:47:39.716
NO I WOULD I WOULD WHAT I WISH I

02:47:39.783 --> 02:47:40.383
HAD IS THAT WHERE YOU GOT AT THE

02:47:40.450 --> 02:47:41.718
END WHICH IS WHAT WAS MY

02:47:41.785 --> 02:47:42.719
RECOMMENDATION. TO ME TO YOU ON

02:47:42.786 --> 02:47:43.853
WHAT DID WE ARE COULD OR SHOULD

02:47:43.920 --> 02:47:44.521
DO.

02:47:44.587 --> 02:47:46.656
THAT'S THE PART MAYBE I STRUGGLE

02:47:46.723 --> 02:47:48.591
WITH A LITTLE BIT MAYBE MAYBE

02:47:48.658 --> 02:47:48.792
LESS.

02:47:48.858 --> 02:47:49.192
HAVE THE ANSWER.

02:47:49.259 --> 02:47:50.293
YOU DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE THE

02:47:50.360 --> 02:47:51.861
ANSWER BUT I CAN TELL YOU WHAT.

02:47:51.928 --> 02:47:52.462
OUR BOARD PRESIDENT HAS BEEN

02:47:52.529 --> 02:47:55.064
SAYING TO EVERYONE -- AND WHICH

02:47:55.131 --> 02:47:56.533
MAKES A LOT OF SENSE IS THAT

02:47:56.599 --> 02:47:58.034
BUILDING ON THE SUCCESSES THAT

02:47:58.101 --> 02:48:00.370
YOU ALREADY HAVE SO WE HAVE THIS

02:48:00.437 --> 02:48:02.505
MANDATE NOW TO DO THESE MORE

02:48:02.572 --> 02:48:04.040
INTEGRATION AND MORE RATE ADDING

02:48:04.107 --> 02:48:06.042
MORE RESILIENCE I'M LOOKING MORE

02:48:06.109 --> 02:48:07.410
AT HABITAT THINGS THAT WE HADN'T

02:48:07.477 --> 02:48:08.344
DONE IN THE PAST.

02:48:08.411 --> 02:48:09.979
WELL WE'VE GOT TEN YEARS OF

02:48:10.046 --> 02:48:12.182
PLANNING EXTENSIVE PLANNING LOTS

02:48:12.248 --> 02:48:13.783
OF FUNDING THAT'S GONE INTO THIS

02:48:13.850 --> 02:48:14.851
AND WE HAVE A REALLY GOOD PLAN

02:48:14.918 --> 02:48:16.786
THAT ALREADY WORKS SO WORK FROM

02:48:16.853 --> 02:48:18.555
THERE AND EXPAND THAT OUT.

02:48:18.621 --> 02:48:20.924
WE CAN ADD IN THE FLOOD MAR WE

02:48:20.990 --> 02:48:22.459
CAN ADD IN THE GROUND WATER

02:48:22.525 --> 02:48:23.827
SUSTAINABILITY ACT TO WHAT WE

02:48:23.893 --> 02:48:25.061
ALREADY HAVE AND SEE WHERE THE

02:48:25.128 --> 02:48:26.796
GAPS ARE AND WORK ON FILLING IN

02:48:26.863 --> 02:48:28.164
FROM THAT DIRECTION RATHER THAN

02:48:28.231 --> 02:48:29.532
TRYING TO START ALL OVER AGAIN

02:48:29.599 --> 02:48:30.834
WITH THE HOLISTIC PLAN AND WORK

02:48:30.900 --> 02:48:33.136
DOWN SO -- THAT'S CERTAINLY A

02:48:33.203 --> 02:48:35.505
STRATEGY THAT I THINKCAN WORK --

02:48:35.572 --> 02:48:36.906
I WOULD HOPE THAT PEOPLE WOULD

02:48:36.973 --> 02:48:38.508
CONSIDER THAT WHO HAVE THE

02:48:38.575 --> 02:48:39.809
ABILITY AND AUTHORITY OUTSIDE OF

02:48:39.876 --> 02:48:41.110
THE FLOOD WORLD SO.

02:48:41.177 --> 02:48:42.579
THAT'S ONE OF OUR CONSTRAINTS IS

02:48:42.645 --> 02:48:44.013
THAT WE HAVE A JURISDICTION IN A

02:48:44.080 --> 02:48:45.815
MANDATE THAT INCLUDES -- THE

02:48:45.882 --> 02:48:48.284
FLOOD WORLD SO IT'S IT'S NOT UP

02:48:48.351 --> 02:48:49.319
TO THE BOARD TO GO OUT AND LOOK

02:48:49.385 --> 02:48:51.221
AT GROUND WATER AND OTHER THINGS

02:48:51.287 --> 02:48:53.690
EXCEPT WHERE THOSE NEXUS ARE SO.

02:48:53.756 --> 02:48:55.258
SO -- THE POWERS THAT BE BEING

02:48:55.325 --> 02:48:57.026
ABLE TO DO THAT AND PERHAPS YOU

02:48:57.093 --> 02:48:58.294
HAVE SOME -- INFLUENCE AND IT'S

02:48:58.361 --> 02:49:01.531
ALREADY IN THAT AREA I WOULD I

02:49:01.598 --> 02:49:02.165
WOULD SAY THAT'S A GOOD PLACE TO

02:49:02.232 --> 02:49:03.066
START.

02:49:03.132 --> 02:49:04.534
I WOULD.

02:49:04.601 --> 02:49:06.202
CHOOSE A LITTLE BIT TO SAY WHAT

02:49:06.269 --> 02:49:07.837
WHAT WHY SEE THE BENEFIT OF NOT

02:49:07.904 --> 02:49:09.138
REINVENTING THE WHEEL.

02:49:09.205 --> 02:49:14.978
IN EXISTING.

02:49:15.044 --> 02:49:17.113
DIRECTIONS AND PLANS.

02:49:17.180 --> 02:49:18.648
YEAH WE TALK ABOUT CALIFORNIA

02:49:18.715 --> 02:49:19.916
WATER PLAN HALF AND ASK PEOPLE

02:49:19.983 --> 02:49:21.251
ACTUALLY READ IT.

02:49:21.317 --> 02:49:22.252
AND TELL ME WHERE THE PLAN PART

02:49:22.318 --> 02:49:23.086
IS.

02:49:23.152 --> 02:49:24.654
BECAUSE IS GIVING SAMPLE I'M

02:49:24.721 --> 02:49:25.288
FORTY ONE YEARS OLD AND IN MY

02:49:25.355 --> 02:49:27.423
LIFETIME THE POPULATION

02:49:27.490 --> 02:49:28.691
CALIFORNIA'S ALMOST DOUBLED.

02:49:28.758 --> 02:49:29.993
OUR WATER SUPPLY HAS INCREASED

02:49:30.059 --> 02:49:30.960
THE STATE AND FEDERAL INVESTMENT

02:49:31.027 --> 02:49:32.495
WASH WAS INCREASED BY ABOUT 1%.

02:49:32.562 --> 02:49:33.096
WHEN YOU DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF

02:49:33.162 --> 02:49:33.930
PEOPLE?

02:49:33.997 --> 02:49:34.964
AND YOU INCREASE YOU WASH BY BY

02:49:35.031 --> 02:49:36.165
1%.

02:49:36.232 --> 02:49:37.967
IT SHOULDN'T BE REAL HARD TO

02:49:38.034 --> 02:49:39.335
FIGURE OUT WHAT'S PROMISE RIGHT.

02:49:39.402 --> 02:49:41.004
AND UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE WE

02:49:41.070 --> 02:49:42.438
OPERATE IN SILOS FUND MANAGEMENT

02:49:42.505 --> 02:49:45.642
VERSES WATER QUALITY VERSUS ACTS --

02:49:45.708 --> 02:49:47.110
I THINK WE'RE MISSING OUT ON

02:49:47.176 --> 02:49:48.945
OPPORTUNITIES UP TO SAY GO ABOVE

02:49:49.012 --> 02:49:51.481
AND BEYOND EVEN JUST -- WATER

02:49:51.548 --> 02:49:53.783
RIGHT -- THE CONTRIBUTIONS THAT

02:49:53.850 --> 02:49:55.118
HYDRO MAKES TOWARDS REAL WINNER

02:49:55.184 --> 02:49:56.152
SHE IN THE SERIOUS THREAT OF

02:49:56.219 --> 02:49:57.387
CLIMATE CHANGE IS A MAJOR

02:49:57.453 --> 02:50:00.290
SUBJECT -- THE GETS LOST IN THIS

02:50:00.356 --> 02:50:02.191
IN THIS SAME WASH RIGHT SO WE

02:50:02.258 --> 02:50:04.260
COULD BE SOLVING MULTIPLE

02:50:04.327 --> 02:50:06.729
PROBLEMS -- BY MAKING SOME THESE

02:50:06.796 --> 02:50:08.531
INVESTMENTS AND AND CREATED

02:50:08.598 --> 02:50:09.899
GREATER COLLABORATION -- AND BY

02:50:09.966 --> 02:50:11.634
ALLOWING PEOPLE TO OPERATE IN

02:50:11.701 --> 02:50:13.436
SILOS IN VARIOUS AGENCIES AND

02:50:13.503 --> 02:50:14.904
NOT NECESSARILY COLLABORATE

02:50:14.971 --> 02:50:16.372
COMMUNICATE -- I THINK WE'RE

02:50:16.439 --> 02:50:18.508
MISSING A WHOLE LOT OF REALLY

02:50:18.575 --> 02:50:20.076
GREAT OPPORTUNITIES I THINK IT

02:50:20.143 --> 02:50:21.411
IS HAPPENING LOCALLY A LITTLE

02:50:21.477 --> 02:50:22.579
BIT YOU KNOW I THINK LESLIE

02:50:22.645 --> 02:50:23.479
BROUGHT UP IN HER COMMENTS

02:50:23.546 --> 02:50:24.080
EARLIER.

02:50:24.147 --> 02:50:26.616
OF THE RECOGNITION NOW THAT THE

02:50:26.683 --> 02:50:28.418
STORM WATER CAPTURE YOU KNOW AND

02:50:28.484 --> 02:50:30.053
BECAUSE OF TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE

02:50:30.119 --> 02:50:32.221
HAVE OF WE CAN RE USE THAT WATER

02:50:32.288 --> 02:50:34.524
AND YOU KNOW THINGS ARE RECHARGE

02:50:34.591 --> 02:50:36.893
AND SO I KNOW AT LEAST LOCALLY

02:50:36.960 --> 02:50:38.094
THEY'RE STARTING TO DO THAT YOU

02:50:38.161 --> 02:50:39.662
KNOW WHETHER WE'VE GOT A HANDLE

02:50:39.729 --> 02:50:40.330
ON IT.

02:50:40.396 --> 02:50:41.564
IN THE BIGGER SENSE LIKE YOU'RE

02:50:41.631 --> 02:50:43.666
ASKING YOU KNOW THAT'S WERE

02:50:43.733 --> 02:50:44.834
DEFINITELY I THINK IMPROVEMENT

02:50:44.901 --> 02:50:45.902
COULD OCCUR.

02:50:45.969 --> 02:50:47.470
THE GOOD NEWS IS WITH THE AS I

02:50:47.537 --> 02:50:49.339
SAID EARLIER THE GOVERNOR'S

02:50:49.405 --> 02:50:50.974
ISSUED EXECUTIVE ORDER -- SEEMS

02:50:51.040 --> 02:50:52.842
TO BE PUSHING OUT LOOKING FOR

02:50:52.909 --> 02:50:54.978
THE KIND OF COLLABORATION --

02:50:55.044 --> 02:50:55.912
THAT I'M SPEAKING OF SO I'VE GOT

02:50:55.979 --> 02:50:57.046
ONE FEELING AT THE MOMENT

02:50:57.113 --> 02:50:58.581
SOMEWHAT OPTIMISTIC ABOUT.

02:50:58.648 --> 02:50:59.849
THE TEAM UP HERE IN SACRAMENTO

02:50:59.916 --> 02:51:02.452
AND THE INTEREST IN AT LEAST --

02:51:02.518 --> 02:51:04.587
IDENTIFYING YOU KNOW THESE

02:51:04.654 --> 02:51:05.655
PATHWAYS TO COLLABORATE

02:51:05.722 --> 02:51:06.656
OCCURRING AND REALLY HAVE A A

02:51:06.723 --> 02:51:14.831
STRONG WATER PLAN FOR THE NEXT

02:51:14.897 --> 02:51:15.131
FIFTY YEARS.

02:51:15.198 --> 02:51:17.033
I AM HOPEFUL.

02:51:17.100 --> 02:51:18.301
TO AT THINK -- TO THE THE

02:51:18.368 --> 02:51:19.569
REASONS THAT I MENTIONED THE THE

02:51:19.636 --> 02:51:20.169
FLOOD MANAGEMENT REGION'S AT

02:51:20.236 --> 02:51:21.170
LEAST UP IN OUR AREA YOU KNOW

02:51:21.237 --> 02:51:22.271
THOSE DO THE STAKEHOLDERS THAT

02:51:22.338 --> 02:51:23.172
ARE INVOLVED IN THAT -- WHILE

02:51:23.239 --> 02:51:24.173
THE FOCUS MAY BE FLOOD ARE ALSO

02:51:24.240 --> 02:51:25.541
WATER SUPPLY FOLKS MAY NOT WE

02:51:25.608 --> 02:51:26.376
HAVE A WATER SUPPLY MISSION IN

02:51:26.442 --> 02:51:27.744
OUR DISTRICT -- AND THE THE

02:51:27.810 --> 02:51:29.212
COUNTIES IN OTHER FOLKS THAT ARE

02:51:29.278 --> 02:51:30.947
INVOLVED IN THAT SO WILD WHILE

02:51:31.014 --> 02:51:32.281
IT MIGHT NOT BE DIRECT.

02:51:32.348 --> 02:51:33.516
THERE IS ALWAYS A WATER SUPPLY

02:51:33.583 --> 02:51:34.851
THOUGHT IN THE BACK OF MOST OF

02:51:34.917 --> 02:51:38.855
THOSE FOLKS MIND AS WE AS WE

02:51:38.921 --> 02:51:40.323
PLAN AND SO I YOU KNOW I'M I'M

02:51:40.390 --> 02:51:41.858
LESS AWARE OF SOME OF THE OTHER

02:51:41.924 --> 02:51:43.259
REGIONS AND AND IF THE

02:51:43.326 --> 02:51:46.462
STAKEHOLDERS ARE -- IS MIX OF I

02:51:46.529 --> 02:51:47.530
THINK I WERE ONLY ONE OF FOR

02:51:47.597 --> 02:51:48.164
RECLAMATION DISTRICTS THAT HAS

02:51:48.231 --> 02:51:49.766
WATER SUPPLY MISSION SO MOST

02:51:49.832 --> 02:51:51.234
RECLAMATIONS ACTUALLY DON'T.

02:51:51.300 --> 02:51:53.136
HAVE A WATER SUPPLY MISSION --

02:51:53.202 --> 02:51:55.038
BUT WE'RE LUCKY IN THAT WE DO

02:51:55.104 --> 02:51:57.173
AND IT DOES IT IT DOESN'T ALLOW

02:51:57.240 --> 02:51:58.875
US TO KIND OF THINK A LITTLE BIT

02:51:58.941 --> 02:52:00.176
MORE BROADLY ABOUT ALL.

02:52:00.243 --> 02:52:02.178
GROUNDWATER AND SURFACE WATER

02:52:02.245 --> 02:52:06.015
AND FLOOD IN AND ALL OF THOSE

02:52:06.082 --> 02:52:08.351
COMBINED.

02:52:08.418 --> 02:52:09.352
OKAY REALLY DIGITAL QUESTIONS

02:52:09.419 --> 02:52:10.920
ARE FOR THE MEMBERS.

COMMUNITIES WITHIN THAT IN ALL

02:53:10.113 --> 02:53:11.114
ASPECTS OF EMERGENCY

02:53:11.180 --> 02:53:13.349
PREPAREDNESS IN ALL THE HAZARDS

02:53:13.416 --> 02:53:15.084
THAT WE FACE -- FLOOD IS

02:53:15.151 --> 02:53:17.520
DEFINITELY -- ONE THAT

02:53:17.587 --> 02:53:19.255
HISTORICALLY -- AS WE'VE HEARD

02:53:19.322 --> 02:53:21.424
THROUGHOUT THE DAY HAS BEEN ONE

02:53:21.491 --> 02:53:22.458
OF THE MOST FREQUENT IT'S

02:53:22.525 --> 02:53:23.760
AFFECTED EVERY COUNTY IN SOME

02:53:23.826 --> 02:53:25.928
WAY -- OVER HISTORY AND IS

02:53:25.995 --> 02:53:28.898
RESULTED IN A LOT OF LOSSES AND

02:53:28.965 --> 02:53:30.233
CERTAINLY -- A LOT OF STE --

02:53:30.299 --> 02:53:32.468
MERGES YOU DECLARATIONS AND AND

02:53:32.535 --> 02:53:34.303
RESPONSES I'M SO IT'S IT'S

02:53:34.370 --> 02:53:36.139
CRITICAL FOR US TO BE READY FOR

02:53:36.205 --> 02:53:36.739
THAT.

02:53:36.806 --> 02:53:38.541
AND I'LL JUST SPEAK VERY BRIEFLY

02:53:38.608 --> 02:53:40.009
ABOUT SORT OF HOW WE FRAMERS HE

02:53:40.076 --> 02:53:41.611
PREFERS A CALIFORNIANS SPECIFIC

02:53:41.677 --> 02:53:42.779
TO FLAT AND CERTAINLY WANT TO

02:53:42.845 --> 02:53:43.980
GET TO YOUR QUESTIONS FIRST AND

02:53:44.046 --> 02:53:47.350
FOREMOST AS WELL AS MY CO

02:53:47.416 --> 02:53:48.251
PANELIST HERE.

02:53:48.317 --> 02:53:49.485
SO PLAN PREPAREDNESS FOR AS FAR

02:53:49.552 --> 02:53:50.887
AS WE LOOK AT THAT AND EMERGENCY

02:53:50.953 --> 02:53:52.688
SERVICES SPANS A LOT OF THINGS

02:53:52.755 --> 02:53:53.956
PART OF THAT IS PLANNING.

02:53:54.023 --> 02:53:55.992
ON HAVING EMERGENCY PLANS SO

02:53:56.058 --> 02:53:57.627
THAT WERE READY AND UNDERSTAND --

02:53:57.693 --> 02:53:59.128
WHAT ROLES RESPONSIBILITIES ARE

02:53:59.195 --> 02:54:00.396
AND WHAT TYPE OF RESPONSE WE

02:54:00.463 --> 02:54:01.531
MIGHT NEED TO UNDERTAKE TO SAVE

02:54:01.597 --> 02:54:03.166
LIVES AND PROTECT PROPERTY BUT

02:54:03.232 --> 02:54:04.567
ALSO INCLUDES THINGS LIKE

02:54:04.634 --> 02:54:06.068
TRAINING AND EXERCISES?

02:54:06.135 --> 02:54:07.203
INCLUDES RISK REDUCTION IT'S ALL

02:54:07.270 --> 02:54:09.272
THOSE THINGS TO GET READY FOR

02:54:09.338 --> 02:54:09.872
EMERGENCIES SO THEY ARE LESS

02:54:09.939 --> 02:54:12.608
IMPACTFUL -- FOR ON THE PLANNING

02:54:12.675 --> 02:54:14.210
SIDE WE HAVE A STATE EMERGENCY

02:54:14.277 --> 02:54:15.878
PLAN THAT ARTICULATES OUR SYSTEM

02:54:15.945 --> 02:54:18.281
RESPONSE THINGS LIKE MUTUAL AID

02:54:18.347 --> 02:54:20.082
HOW RESOURCES MOVE AROUND THE

02:54:20.149 --> 02:54:20.783
STATE TO DEAL WITH MULTIPLE

02:54:20.850 --> 02:54:21.651
HAZARDS.

02:54:21.717 --> 02:54:23.186
AND WE'VE ALSO -- DONE A NUMBER

02:54:23.252 --> 02:54:24.687
OF WHAT WE CALL CATASTROPHIC

02:54:24.754 --> 02:54:27.390
SCENARIO PLANS FOR EARTHQUAKE --

02:54:27.456 --> 02:54:29.859
AND ALSO FOR FLOOD HAZARDS HOW

02:54:29.926 --> 02:54:31.861
WOULD A VERY AND LARGE FLOOD

02:54:31.928 --> 02:54:32.929
EMERGENCY.

02:54:32.995 --> 02:54:34.564
THAT AFFECTS A LARGE SWATH OF

02:54:34.630 --> 02:54:35.898
THE STATE HOW THE STATE AND

02:54:35.965 --> 02:54:41.470
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT COME TOGETHER

02:54:41.537 --> 02:54:43.105
TO RESPOND TO THAT AT TO

02:54:43.172 --> 02:54:43.639
SUPPORTER COUNTY SO IT'S

02:54:43.706 --> 02:54:44.607
IMPORTANT FOR US TO EXAMINE THE

02:54:44.674 --> 02:54:44.907
SCENARIOS.

02:54:44.974 --> 02:54:46.075
SO THE CAN REALLY LOOK AT

02:54:46.142 --> 02:54:47.176
SOMETHING THAT EITHER WE HAVEN'T

02:54:47.243 --> 02:54:47.944
FACED IN A LONG TIME OR THAT WE

02:54:48.010 --> 02:54:48.411
HAVEN'T FACED AT ALL.

02:54:48.477 --> 02:54:49.078
UNDERSTAND HOW WE MIGHT HAVE --

02:54:49.145 --> 02:54:49.946
TO COME TOGETHER TO RESPOND TO

02:54:50.012 --> 02:54:52.748
THAT EFFECTIVELY -- IN TERMS OF

02:54:52.815 --> 02:54:54.317
PLANNING WE ALSO HAVE A NEW ROLE

02:54:54.383 --> 02:54:55.551
AT CALLAWAY YES THE RESULT OF

02:54:55.618 --> 02:54:57.687
THE OROVILLE EVENT AND THAT IS

02:54:57.753 --> 02:55:00.289
TO OVERSEE THE EMERGENCY ACTION

02:55:00.356 --> 02:55:01.624
PLANS BY ALL THE REGULATED.

02:55:01.691 --> 02:55:03.993
DAM OWNERS IN CALIFORNIA SO

02:55:04.060 --> 02:55:06.062
THAT'S A VERY DIRECT -- ROLE

02:55:06.128 --> 02:55:07.396
THAT SOUNDS THAT WERE WORKING

02:55:07.463 --> 02:55:08.898
WITH THOSE OWNERS AND BY

02:55:08.965 --> 02:55:10.766
EXTENSION THE COMMUNITIES WHERE

02:55:10.833 --> 02:55:12.869
THOSE DAM -- INUNDATIONS MIGHT

02:55:12.935 --> 02:55:14.837
IMPACT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY

02:55:14.904 --> 02:55:16.839
UNDERSTAND THAT YOU KNOW WHERE

02:55:16.906 --> 02:55:19.375
WE'RE AT DAM ISSUE IF THERE WERE

02:55:19.442 --> 02:55:21.010
TO BE A PROBLEM OR FAILURE HOW

02:55:21.077 --> 02:55:21.477
THAT WOULD AFFECT THE

02:55:21.544 --> 02:55:22.578
COMMUNITIES DOWNSTREAM.

02:55:22.645 --> 02:55:24.981
HOW THEY WOULD NOTIFY -- PEOPLE

AREA -- BUT THOSE THOSE GIVE US

03:04:06.101 --> 03:04:07.069
A A FRAMEWORK OF WHAT'S

03:04:07.136 --> 03:04:08.103
SOMETHING -- WE'RE REALLY KIND

03:04:08.170 --> 03:04:08.904
OF A MAXIMUM THE MAXIMUM TYPE OF

03:04:08.971 --> 03:04:09.872
EVENT SO IT ALLOWS US TO GET

03:04:09.938 --> 03:04:11.140
EVERYBODY TOGETHER TALK ABOUT

03:04:11.206 --> 03:04:12.274
ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES SOME

03:04:12.341 --> 03:04:13.909
OF THE REALITIES OF THE TIMING

03:04:13.976 --> 03:04:15.844
ON RESOURCES THAT MIGHT BECOMING

03:04:15.911 --> 03:04:16.979
A FAR TO HELP US DEAL WITH

03:04:17.045 --> 03:04:17.613
SOMETHING.

US WITH OTHER EVENTS AND I'LL

03:04:24.219 --> 03:04:26.088
GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE THE IN THAT

03:04:26.155 --> 03:04:28.690
ORVILLE -- DAM EMERGENCY WE

03:04:28.757 --> 03:04:29.858
ACTUALLY ACTIVATED FOR THE FIRST

03:04:29.925 --> 03:04:32.761
TIME THAT HAVE KIND OF A UNIFIED

03:04:32.828 --> 03:04:34.763
COMMAND AT THE AT THE YES LEVEL

03:04:34.830 --> 03:04:35.831
WITH THE FEDERAL WITH OUR FELLOW

CONTROL ENDED UP BEING VERY

03:04:45.007 --> 03:04:46.041
USEFUL AND WE'RE ABLE TO TEST

03:04:46.108 --> 03:04:47.976

FEDERAL PARTNERS SO SO REALLY

03:04:53.682 --> 03:04:55.184
THE IDEA IS WE LOOK AT THESE --

03:04:55.250 --> 03:04:56.618
MAXIMUM SCENARIOS BUT THE

03:04:56.685 --> 03:04:58.954

WITH EITHER DISASTERS THAT ARE

03:05:00.389 --> 03:05:02.491
LESS IMPACTFUL OR OTHER TYPES OF

03:05:02.558 --> 03:05:03.792
EVENTS THAT -- IT KIND OF KEEPS

03:05:03.859 --> 03:05:11.567
AS PRACTICED IN THAT THAT

03:05:11.633 --> 03:05:12.067
DIALOGUE OF HOW WE WOULD

03:05:12.134 --> 03:05:13.469
APPROACH.

03:05:13.535 --> 03:05:18.407
A BIG EMERGENCY.

LOT ABOUT AGENCIES WORKING IN

03:05:22.711 --> 03:05:22.911
THEIR OWN.

03:05:22.978 --> 03:05:23.145
SILOS.

03:05:23.212 --> 03:05:25.113
YOU HAVE TO COORDINATE WITH A

03:05:25.180 --> 03:05:26.648

FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- TO THE

03:05:28.784 --> 03:05:30.018
LOCAL COMMUNITIES.

03:05:30.085 --> 03:05:31.253
WHAT IS YOU KNOW MAYBE THE LAST --

03:05:31.320 --> 03:05:32.554

I THINK THE PUBLIC -- SHOULD GET

03:05:39.194 --> 03:05:41.163
A BETTER SENSE OF THAT -- LEVEL

03:05:41.230 --> 03:05:42.231
OF COMMUNICATION THAT'S

03:05:42.297 --> 03:05:45.834
HAPPENING ON REAL TIME AND

03:05:45.901 --> 03:05:46.969

03:05:55.143 --> 03:05:56.478
I'M SORRY. TO OFFSET THAT

03:05:56.545 --> 03:05:57.513
CALIFORNIA HAS A LOCAL STANDARD

03:05:57.579 --> 03:05:58.413
SYSTEM FOR RESPONSE IT WAS A

03:05:58.480 --> 03:06:00.215
LESSON WE LEARNED ON BACK IN THE

03:06:00.282 --> 03:06:01.783
NINETIES AFTER THE OAKLAND HILLS

03:06:01.850 --> 03:06:03.151
FIRE AND THEN SUBSEQUENTLY WAS

03:06:03.218 --> 03:06:04.219
TESTED IN.

03:06:04.286 --> 03:06:05.354
SOME OF THE EVENTS AND THAT

03:06:05.420 --> 03:06:06.889
REALLY -- ORGANIZES EMERGENCY

03:06:06.955 --> 03:06:08.957
SERVICES THE SAME WAY AT EVERY

03:06:09.024 --> 03:06:10.292
LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT SO --

03:06:10.359 --> 03:06:11.226
WHETHER IT'S LOCAL FIELD

03:06:11.293 --> 03:06:13.695
RESPONDERS ON THE SCENE AND THEM

03:06:13.762 --> 03:06:15.898
PORTENTS OF THAT IS BECAUSE YOU

03:06:15.964 --> 03:06:16.965
NEVER KNOW WHO'S GOING TO NEED

03:06:17.032 --> 03:06:18.166
TO COME TOGETHER IN AN EVENT AND

03:06:18.233 --> 03:06:19.835
SO THEY NEED TO BE.

03:06:19.902 --> 03:06:21.336
APPROACHING THE MANAGEMENT OR

03:06:21.403 --> 03:06:23.105
MERCY IN A IN A SYSTEMATIC AND

03:06:23.171 --> 03:06:25.107
CONSISTENT WAY AND THEN EVERY

03:06:25.173 --> 03:06:26.775
LAYER THAT'S RESPONDING NEEDS TO

03:06:26.842 --> 03:06:27.776
BE ABLE TO QUICKLY AND

03:06:27.843 --> 03:06:29.144
EFFECTIVELY RESPOND TO THOSE WHO

03:06:29.211 --> 03:06:31.146
ARE HELPING THEM -- SO IT MAKES

03:06:31.213 --> 03:06:33.148
A LOT OF SENSE TO TO KEEP TO

03:06:33.215 --> 03:06:34.383
STAND RIGHT AND THAT'S TESTED

03:06:34.449 --> 03:06:35.817
ITSELF OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND

03:06:35.884 --> 03:06:36.852
AND IN ADVANCE IN FACT THE

03:06:36.919 --> 03:06:38.353
NATIONAL GOVERNMENT ADOPTED IT

03:06:38.420 --> 03:06:40.389
IN THE MID TWO THOUSANDS -- SO

03:06:40.455 --> 03:06:41.623
THAT IS WHAT THAT SERVICE TWO

03:06:41.690 --> 03:06:43.325
THINGS PRIMARILY THAT IS AND HOW

03:06:43.392 --> 03:06:45.494
TO MOVE RESOURCES SO IF YOU NEED

03:06:45.561 --> 03:06:46.562
SOMETHING HAVE YOU ASKED FOR IT

03:06:46.628 --> 03:06:47.663
WHO DO YOU ASK.

03:06:47.729 --> 03:06:48.497
AND HOW DO WE GET IT BACK DOWN

03:06:48.564 --> 03:06:50.165
AND ALSO SERVES AS A WAY TO

03:06:50.232 --> 03:06:51.600
PROVIDE SUITABLE BECAUSE

03:06:51.667 --> 03:06:52.534
SITUATIONAL AWARENESS SO HOW DO

03:06:52.601 --> 03:06:54.036
WE COMMUNICATE -- LOCAL

03:06:54.102 --> 03:06:56.004
GOVERNMENT UP TO THE NEXT TO THE

03:06:56.071 --> 03:06:58.807
COUNTY UP TO THE STATE BECAUSE

03:06:58.874 --> 03:07:00.175
OF THE STATE OR HAVE A VANTAGE

03:07:00.242 --> 03:07:01.376
POINT OF MAYBE MULTIPLE COUNTIES

03:07:01.443 --> 03:07:02.244
AFFECTED.

03:07:02.311 --> 03:07:03.512
IN SO HOWEVER WE SORT OF TAKING

03:07:03.579 --> 03:07:05.013
THAT ALL IN AND BEING A FISSION

03:07:05.080 --> 03:07:06.882
AND HOW WE PROVIDE INFORMATION

03:07:06.949 --> 03:07:08.684
AND RESOURCES BACK OUT.

03:07:08.750 --> 03:07:11.153
IT ALSO REQUIRES THAT WE ASK

03:07:11.219 --> 03:07:12.754
WHETHER IT'S STATE -- YES SIR

03:07:12.821 --> 03:07:14.923
AND COUNTY -- YES HAS TO HAVE

03:07:14.990 --> 03:07:16.525
GOOD RELATIONSHIPS WITH

03:07:16.592 --> 03:07:17.960
DIFFERENT ENTITIES WITH

03:07:18.026 --> 03:07:19.728
DIFFERENT SUB EXPERTISE THAT

03:07:19.795 --> 03:07:21.763
MIGHT LEND A HAND IN THAT EVENT

03:07:21.830 --> 03:07:23.599
THAT CANNOT COME TOGETHER.

03:07:23.665 --> 03:07:25.067
IN YOU KNOW WHEN SOMETHING IS

03:07:25.133 --> 03:07:26.134
HAPPEN YOU HAVE TO CULTIVATE

03:07:26.201 --> 03:07:27.936
THAT AHEAD OF TIME FOR EXAMPLE

03:07:28.003 --> 03:07:30.005
OF AT THE STATE LEVEL WE RELY ON

03:07:30.072 --> 03:07:31.840
ALL THE STATE AGENCIES -- TO

03:07:31.907 --> 03:07:34.242
HAVE SOME ROLE IN EITHER GETTING

03:07:34.309 --> 03:07:35.677
READY FOR EMERGENCY RESPONDING

03:07:35.744 --> 03:07:36.979
