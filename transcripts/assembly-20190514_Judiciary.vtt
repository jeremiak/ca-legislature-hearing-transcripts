WEBVTT

00:22:25.377 --> 00:22:27.579
I WOULD ACTUALLY LIKE TO GET

00:22:27.646 --> 00:22:29.214
STARTED I KNOW IF GOING TO HAVE.

SOME COLLEAGUES JOINING US.

00:22:32.551 --> 00:22:35.320
BUT THIS WHEN I LOOK AT OUR

00:22:35.387 --> 00:22:37.155
AMAZING AGENDA.

00:22:37.222 --> 00:22:39.024
REALIZE THIS HAS THE POTENTIAL

00:22:39.091 --> 00:22:41.059
OF BEING A VERY LONG HEARING.

00:22:41.126 --> 00:22:44.129
IS WE HAVE A LOT TO GO OVER.

00:22:44.196 --> 00:22:46.064
SO WELCOME MY NAME IS MARK STONE

00:22:46.131 --> 00:22:47.299
I'M CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY

00:22:47.365 --> 00:22:49.067
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE.

00:22:49.134 --> 00:22:50.802
AND THIS IS A HEARING THAT'S

00:22:50.869 --> 00:22:53.572
BEEN A LONG TIME IN PROCESS AND

00:22:53.638 --> 00:22:54.606
HOPEFULLY.

00:22:54.673 --> 00:22:55.941
GENERATING SOME [inaudible]

00:22:56.007 --> 00:22:57.576
INTEREST.

00:22:57.642 --> 00:22:59.978
TALKING ABOUT DIVERSITY AND THE

00:23:00.045 --> 00:23:01.313
TOPIC FIRST CAME WITH THE

00:23:01.379 --> 00:23:02.581
DISCUSSION AROUND DIVERSITY ON

00:23:02.647 --> 00:23:05.450
THE BENCH.

00:23:05.517 --> 00:23:07.753
DAD AND I THINK OVER THE LAST

00:23:07.819 --> 00:23:09.588
NUMBER OF YEARS WE'VE SEEN SOME

00:23:09.654 --> 00:23:10.756
IMPROVEMENT.

00:23:10.822 --> 00:23:13.492
AT ESPECIALLY WE HAVE A VERY

00:23:13.558 --> 00:23:15.160
DIVERSE TO BRING COURT RIGHT NOW.

00:23:15.227 --> 00:23:16.595
BUT IN LOOKING UP AND DOWN THE

00:23:16.661 --> 00:23:18.430
RANKS OF JUDGES ACROSS STATE

00:23:18.497 --> 00:23:19.097
MANY OF WHOM HAVE BEEN APPOINTED

00:23:19.164 --> 00:23:21.099
OVER THE LAST DECADES IN SOME

00:23:21.166 --> 00:23:22.467
QUITE SOMETIME AGO.

00:23:22.534 --> 00:23:23.935
I THINK WOULD REALLY

00:23:24.002 --> 00:23:24.236
[inaudible]

00:23:24.302 --> 00:23:26.371
HAD.

00:23:26.438 --> 00:23:27.506
AS FOR THE CLEAR.

00:23:27.572 --> 00:23:29.207
NOTION THAT WE HAVE SOME WORK TO

00:23:29.274 --> 00:23:30.942
DO WITH THE JUDICIARY BUT THAT

00:23:31.009 --> 00:23:32.944
RAISE QUESTIONS BECAUSE THE BAR

00:23:33.011 --> 00:23:34.279
IS OBVIOUSLY A PATH TO THE

00:23:34.346 --> 00:23:35.914
JUDICIARY ADD WHEN WE LOOK AT

00:23:35.981 --> 00:23:37.215
THE BAR.

00:23:37.282 --> 00:23:38.683
WE ALSO REALIZE THAT WE HAVE

00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:40.685
SOME STRUGGLES WITH DIVERSITY

00:23:40.752 --> 00:23:42.454
AND LAW FIRMS IN THE PROFESSION

00:23:42.521 --> 00:23:44.122
AND I THINK THE PROFESSION IN

00:23:44.189 --> 00:23:45.557
ORDER TO BE.

00:23:45.624 --> 00:23:47.559
TRULY RECOGNIZED AS BENEFICIAL

00:23:47.626 --> 00:23:49.728
TO CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO LOOK LIKE

00:23:49.795 --> 00:23:51.062
CALIFORNIA DOES.

00:23:51.129 --> 00:23:53.064
AND I'VE LOOKS BY ALL THE DATA

00:23:53.131 --> 00:23:54.132
THAT WE'VE COLLECTED IN THE DATA

00:23:54.199 --> 00:23:55.500
WE'RE GONNA SEE TODAY WERE A

00:23:55.567 --> 00:23:56.535
LONG WAY FROM THAT.

00:23:56.601 --> 00:23:58.036
WE CAN'T TALK ABOUT DIVERSITY IN

00:23:58.103 --> 00:23:59.638
THE BAR WITHOUT TALK ABOUT

00:23:59.704 --> 00:24:01.873
DIVERSITY AT LAW SCHOOLS AND

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:04.509
PIPELINE OF GETTING STUDENTS.

00:24:04.576 --> 00:24:06.611
THROUGH THE EDUCATION SYSTEM AND

00:24:06.678 --> 00:24:08.380
INTO LAW SCHOOLS AND I KNOW THAT

00:24:08.446 --> 00:24:10.282
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF CHALLENGES

00:24:10.348 --> 00:24:11.349
THAT THAT REPRESENTS.

00:24:11.416 --> 00:24:13.718
WAS LEGISLATURE'S WORKING HARD

00:24:13.785 --> 00:24:15.053
TO TRY AND MAKE SURE WE ARE.

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:17.556
EDUCATING ALL STUDENTS BUT GIVEN

00:24:17.622 --> 00:24:19.958
SOCIOECONOMIC FACTORS GIVEN

00:24:20.025 --> 00:24:21.693
OTHER FACTORS RACIAL FACTORS WE

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:23.195
KNOW THAT THE EDUCATION SYSTEM

00:24:23.261 --> 00:24:25.130
IN CALIFORNIA IS NOT EQUAL IN IS

00:24:25.197 --> 00:24:26.965
NOT EQUITABLE WHICH MEANS.

00:24:27.032 --> 00:24:29.134
THAT PROFESSIONS ARE ALSO NOT

00:24:29.201 --> 00:24:31.336
GOING TO HAVE OFFER THE SAME

00:24:31.403 --> 00:24:33.538
OPPORTUNITY AS EVERYONE ELSE.

00:24:33.605 --> 00:24:34.039
WE'RE ALSO GONNA BE DISK

00:24:34.105 --> 00:24:35.040
EXPLORING.

00:24:35.106 --> 00:24:37.409
OR TOUCHING ON A NUMBER OF

00:24:37.475 --> 00:24:38.810
NOTIONS AND POTENTIAL

00:24:38.877 --> 00:24:41.112
IMPEDIMENTS TO DIVERSITY IN THE

00:24:41.179 --> 00:24:42.848
LEGAL PROFESSION THINGS LIKE THE

00:24:42.914 --> 00:24:44.082
BAR CUT SCORE.

00:24:44.149 --> 00:24:45.817
THE FACT THAT CALIFORNIA HAS NO

00:24:45.884 --> 00:24:47.619
RECIPROCITY WITH OTHER STATES WE

00:24:47.686 --> 00:24:49.754
HAVE BECOME IN A WAY A BIT OF AN

00:24:49.821 --> 00:24:52.190
ISLAND ON OUR OWN THROUGH

00:24:52.257 --> 00:24:53.291
HISTORICAL REASONS.

00:24:53.358 --> 00:24:55.126
BUT I I THINK I HOPE THAT

00:24:55.193 --> 00:24:56.862
THROUGH THIS DISCUSSION AND

00:24:56.928 --> 00:24:58.029
OTHER DISCUSSIONS TO COME THIS

00:24:58.096 --> 00:24:59.431
IS SUCH A BROAD TOPIC AT THIS

00:24:59.497 --> 00:25:01.299
POINT.

00:25:01.366 --> 00:25:03.034
LET IT SERVICES.

00:25:03.101 --> 00:25:05.503
MORE OF AN INTRODUCTION TO THE

00:25:05.570 --> 00:25:07.172
ISSUES TO THE CHALLENGES -- A

00:25:07.239 --> 00:25:08.940
STATEMENT IF YOU WELL AND

00:25:09.007 --> 00:25:11.109
HOPEFULLY A GAUNTLET LAY DOWN.

00:25:11.176 --> 00:25:13.278
FOR ALL OF US TO TAKE OUR PART

00:25:13.345 --> 00:25:14.746
RESPONSIBLY FOR OUR PARTS OF

00:25:14.813 --> 00:25:16.147
ENSURING THAT WE ARE LOOKING

00:25:16.214 --> 00:25:18.850
ACROSS THE LEGAL PROFESSION FROM.

00:25:18.917 --> 00:25:20.952
THOSE IN SCHOOL NOW WHO WOULD

00:25:21.019 --> 00:25:22.821
SEEK TO BECOME ATTORNEYS TO

00:25:22.888 --> 00:25:25.223
THOSE WHO ARE ALL THE WAY UP

00:25:25.290 --> 00:25:26.024
BEING APPOINTED TO THE SUPREME

00:25:26.091 --> 00:25:27.826
COURT IN CALIFORNIA AND EVERYONE

00:25:27.893 --> 00:25:28.994
IN BETWEEN THAT WE ARE ALL

00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:30.228
TAKING OUR PART.

00:25:30.295 --> 00:25:31.696
IN ENSURING THAT WE ARE THINKING

00:25:31.763 --> 00:25:33.531
ABOUT LOOKING AT AND ASK

00:25:33.598 --> 00:25:35.267
OURSELVES THE QUESTION HOW CAN

00:25:35.333 --> 00:25:37.369
WE BEST ENSURE THAT WE HAVE THE

00:25:37.435 --> 00:25:39.838
MOST DIVERSE BAR THE MOST

00:25:39.905 --> 00:25:41.873
REPRESENTATIVE BAR AND BENCH.

00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:43.642
FOR ALL OF CALIFORNIANS AND THAT

00:25:43.708 --> 00:25:46.011
MEANS THERE SHOULD BE NO ISSUES

00:25:46.077 --> 00:25:47.512
THAT WE ARE UNWILLING TO LOOK AT

00:25:47.579 --> 00:25:49.381
THESE THERE SHOULD BE NO ISSUES.

00:25:49.447 --> 00:25:51.816
THAT WE ARE UNWILLING TO TACKLE

00:25:51.883 --> 00:25:53.551
IN THAT QUEST I THINK THAT'S

00:25:53.618 --> 00:25:56.321
GOOD FOR CALIFORNIA AND GOOD.

00:25:56.388 --> 00:25:57.923
FOR THE THE LEGAL PROFESSION AS

00:25:57.989 --> 00:25:59.057
A WHOLE.

00:25:59.124 --> 00:26:00.725
SO WE HAVE QUITE A FEW PEOPLE

00:26:00.792 --> 00:26:02.994
THAT THE THE LIST ON THE AGENDA

00:26:03.061 --> 00:26:04.529
STARTED TO GET BIGGER AND BIGGER

00:26:04.596 --> 00:26:05.730
AS WE REALIZE THERE WERE MORE

00:26:05.797 --> 00:26:07.232
AND MORE QUESTIONS.

00:26:07.299 --> 00:26:09.334
WE NEEDED TO ASK [inaudible]

00:26:09.401 --> 00:26:11.603
AND INFORMATION AND EVEN

00:26:11.670 --> 00:26:14.205
QUESTIONS TO PUT ON THE TABLE SO

00:26:14.272 --> 00:26:16.241
I FORESEE SEVERAL.

00:26:16.308 --> 00:26:18.076
OPPORTUNITIES OVER THE COMING

00:26:18.143 --> 00:26:19.377
YEARS TO BE TALKING ABOUT THAT

00:26:19.444 --> 00:26:20.912
AS WELL HOPEFULLY SOONER RATHER

00:26:20.979 --> 00:26:22.013
THAN LATER.

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:23.048
AND I'M ASSUMING WE'RE GOING TO

00:26:23.114 --> 00:26:24.382
BE RAISING A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS

00:26:24.449 --> 00:26:25.684
THAT.

00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:27.485
GIVE US BETTER DIRECTION THE

00:26:27.552 --> 00:26:29.587
LEGISLATURE THE JUDICIAL BRANCH

00:26:29.654 --> 00:26:31.156
AND THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH TO BE

00:26:31.222 --> 00:26:35.193
DOING A BETTER JOB WITH RESPECT

00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:37.562
SO WE'RE ASKING THAT SPEAKERS BE

00:26:37.629 --> 00:26:40.265
ABOUT SEVEN MINUTES OR SO I KNOW

00:26:40.332 --> 00:26:41.800
THAT THESE ARE JUDGES AND

00:26:41.866 --> 00:26:43.568
LAWYERS.

00:26:43.635 --> 00:26:44.602
ADD.

00:26:44.669 --> 00:26:47.072
THE WORST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD

00:26:47.138 --> 00:26:49.007
AND I SPEAK FOR MYSELF TO ASK TO

00:26:49.074 --> 00:26:50.108
BE BRIEF.

00:26:50.175 --> 00:26:53.011
BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE

00:26:53.078 --> 00:26:54.646
COVERING ALL OF THE GROUND

00:26:54.713 --> 00:26:56.982
ANSWERING ALL OF THE QUESTIONS

00:26:57.048 --> 00:26:58.650
OBVIOUSLY IN THIS HEARING. TO BE

00:26:58.717 --> 00:27:00.819
RESPECTFUL OF THE TIME OF THOSE

00:27:00.885 --> 00:27:02.487
ESPECIALLY ON THE PANELS.

00:27:02.554 --> 00:27:04.656
AFTER YOUR PANELS.

00:27:04.723 --> 00:27:06.591
IT'S I WILL TRY AND MAINTAIN

00:27:06.658 --> 00:27:07.826
SOME TIME BUT I WILL TELL YOU A

00:27:07.892 --> 00:27:09.194
VERY INTERESTED IN THIS TOPIC

00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:10.829
AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

00:27:10.895 --> 00:27:12.230
GIVE EVERYBODY THE CHANCE TO

00:27:12.297 --> 00:27:12.630
TALK.

00:27:12.697 --> 00:27:13.932
BUT THEN ALSO THE ELEMENT OPEN

00:27:13.999 --> 00:27:15.867
THIS UP FOR PUBLIC COMMENT WE'VE

00:27:15.934 --> 00:27:17.168
GOT IT ALL SIGN UP LIST GOING.

00:27:17.235 --> 00:27:18.370
IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SIGN UP FOR

00:27:18.436 --> 00:27:20.005
PUBLIC COMMENT IF YOU HAVEN'T

00:27:20.071 --> 00:27:21.206
SIGNED UP ON THAT LIST THAT WILL

00:27:21.272 --> 00:27:22.307
NOT PRECLUDE YOU FROM MAKING A

00:27:22.374 --> 00:27:23.775
PUBLIC COMMENT.

00:27:23.842 --> 00:27:25.310
BUT DEPENDING ON WHEN THAT

00:27:25.377 --> 00:27:27.779
STARTS THOSE MIGHT BE LIMITED TO

00:27:27.846 --> 00:27:30.348
FAIRLY SHORT STATEMENTS.

00:27:30.415 --> 00:27:32.650
WHICH I HATE TO DO BECAUSE

00:27:32.717 --> 00:27:33.918
GETTING PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT AT

00:27:33.985 --> 00:27:36.621
ALL THIS IS GOING TO BE VERY

00:27:36.688 --> 00:27:38.156
CRITICAL AS WE MOVE FORWARD.

00:27:38.223 --> 00:27:40.825
THIS IS THE ASSEMBLY.

00:27:40.892 --> 00:27:41.793
EIGHT IN AN INFORMATIONAL

00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:43.728
HEARING THE SOMEBODY JUDICIARY

00:27:43.795 --> 00:27:44.662
COMMITTEE BUT WE HAVE ALSO ASKED

00:27:44.729 --> 00:27:47.399
THE LEGISLATURE HAS A NUMBER OF

00:27:47.465 --> 00:27:48.900
ETHNIC CAUCUSES.

00:27:48.967 --> 00:27:50.935
THAT WE'VE INVITED TO JOIN US

00:27:51.002 --> 00:27:53.738
AND THE OUR IS A BIT EARLY I

00:27:53.805 --> 00:27:54.572
SUPPOSE.

00:27:54.639 --> 00:27:57.409
BUT THAT WE HAVE INVITED AT A

00:27:57.475 --> 00:27:59.210
NUMBER OF LEGISLATORS TO COME TO

00:27:59.277 --> 00:28:00.745
THE DIS TO PROVIDE INFORMATION

00:28:00.812 --> 00:28:02.313
TO HELP US WITH THIS.

00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:04.716
BECAUSE THE VARIOUS CAUCUSES THE

00:28:04.783 --> 00:28:07.085
API CAUCUS THE LEGISLATIVE BLACK

00:28:07.152 --> 00:28:08.453
CAUCUS LATINO CAUCUS.

00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:10.555
HAVE BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT OF

00:28:10.622 --> 00:28:11.523
INSURING.

00:28:11.589 --> 00:28:14.192
THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS VERY

00:28:14.259 --> 00:28:16.728
COGNIZANT OF DECISIONS THAT WE

00:28:16.795 --> 00:28:18.329
MAKE WITH RESPECT TO RACE AND A

00:28:18.396 --> 00:28:20.565
SPECIAL. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

00:28:20.632 --> 00:28:21.866
THAT THIS LEGISLATURE TO EXPAND

00:28:21.933 --> 00:28:23.268
STRUGGLING WITH AND HAS BEEN

00:28:23.334 --> 00:28:25.103
GETTING GREAT GUIDANCE FROM THE

00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:26.271
GLBT CAUCUS.

00:28:26.337 --> 00:28:27.639
BECAUSE LET'S SAY WE HAVE NOT

00:28:27.705 --> 00:28:30.208
ALWAYS BEEN SENSITIVE TO THE

00:28:30.275 --> 00:28:32.744
THAT BRETT OF PEOPLE ACROSS

00:28:32.811 --> 00:28:34.179
CALIFORNIA WE'RE TRYING TO BE.

00:28:34.245 --> 00:28:36.748
MUCH BETTER ABOUT IT AND AS WE

00:28:36.815 --> 00:28:38.083
HAVE NOW MORE AND MORE.

00:28:38.149 --> 00:28:41.019
PEOPLE OUT OF THE LGBT COMMUNITY

00:28:41.086 --> 00:28:42.687
COMING TO THE LEGISLATURE AND

00:28:42.754 --> 00:28:45.190
EDUCATING US AS WE DO POLICY.

00:28:45.256 --> 00:28:46.091
GIVES US THE OPPORTUNITY TO

00:28:46.157 --> 00:28:48.326
CLEAN UP ALL STATUTES TO TAKE

00:28:48.393 --> 00:28:51.262
OFFENSIVE LANGUAGE OUT AND AND

00:28:51.329 --> 00:28:53.031
MODERNIZE WHAT WE'RE DOING SO

00:28:53.098 --> 00:28:54.632
THAT'S A CAUCUS THAT REPRESENTS

00:28:54.699 --> 00:28:56.034
A VERY IMPORTANT PART.

00:28:56.101 --> 00:28:59.671
OF OUR DISCUSSION AS WELL.

00:28:59.737 --> 00:29:00.738

AROUND NOVEMBER MY FAMILY AND I

00:31:27.785 --> 00:31:30.021
SOUTHERN ARIZONA.

00:31:30.088 --> 00:31:31.923
WE WERE MIGRANT FARM WORKERS.

00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:33.458
I REMEMBER IT CLEARLY AS IF IT

00:31:33.524 --> 00:31:34.826
WERE YESTERDAY.

00:31:34.892 --> 00:31:36.761
WE PACKED TWO DISHES OLD POTS

00:31:36.828 --> 00:31:39.664

00:31:39.731 --> 00:31:41.432
MY FAMILY AND I ALL NEW THAT

00:31:41.499 --> 00:31:43.067
COME EARLY NOVEMBER.

00:31:43.134 --> 00:31:44.302
WE WOULD START PACKING OUR

00:31:44.369 --> 00:31:46.271
THINGS TO DRIVE DOWN TO ARIZONA

00:31:46.337 --> 00:31:49.907
AND IN MAY DRIVE BACK UP NORTH.

00:31:49.974 --> 00:31:51.809
WE DID THIS FOR FOURTEEN YEARS

00:31:51.876 --> 00:31:52.410
AND IT WAS THE BEST PART OF MY

00:31:52.477 --> 00:31:53.678
LIFE.

00:31:53.745 --> 00:31:55.046
IT CREATED A TYPE OF BOND WITH

00:31:55.113 --> 00:31:56.547
MY FAMILY THAT COULD NEVER BE

00:31:56.614 --> 00:31:58.149
BROKEN.

00:31:58.216 --> 00:31:59.217
THOUGH THERE WAS LOVE AND JOY IN

00:31:59.284 --> 00:32:00.418
THESE BEAUTIFUL FOURTEEN YEARS

00:32:00.485 --> 00:32:02.053
OF MY LIFE.

00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:03.454
I ALSO MISSED OUT ON A LOT OF

00:32:03.521 --> 00:32:05.323
EDUCATION AS A RESULT OF THE NAY

00:32:05.390 --> 00:32:07.992
UNSTABLE NATURE OF MIGRATING.

00:32:08.059 --> 00:32:10.695
THIS WAS BECAUSE WHEN WE ARRIVED

00:32:10.762 --> 00:32:11.329
WE OFTEN DIDN'T HAVE A PLACE TO

00:32:11.396 --> 00:32:13.197
STAY.

00:32:13.264 --> 00:32:14.499
MY NEAR MY WHOLE FAMILY STAYED

00:32:14.565 --> 00:32:15.867
IN MY UNCLE'S LIVING ROOM IN HIS

00:32:15.933 --> 00:32:17.101
GREEN TRAILER.

00:32:17.168 --> 00:32:18.469
THE NEXT YEAR.

00:32:18.536 --> 00:32:20.071
WE COULD BUY A TRAILER AND THE

00:32:20.138 --> 00:32:21.839
YEAR AFTER THAT.

00:32:21.906 --> 00:32:23.675
WE COULD AFFORD AN APARTMENT.

00:32:23.741 --> 00:32:25.109
I NEVER KNOW IF I WAS GOING TO

00:32:25.176 --> 00:32:26.477
HAVE A ROOM OF MY OWN OR A PLACE

00:32:26.544 --> 00:32:28.713
TO STUDY.

00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:29.247
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SELFISH

00:32:29.314 --> 00:32:30.715
DIVIDED.

00:32:30.782 --> 00:32:31.983
I NEVER KNEW HOW FAR I WAS GOING

00:32:32.050 --> 00:32:33.785
TO BE FROM SCHOOL IF I HAD TO

00:32:33.851 --> 00:32:35.286
WALK OR TAKE THE BUS.

00:32:35.353 --> 00:32:36.921
BUT I KNEW THAT MY OLDER SISTER

00:32:36.988 --> 00:32:39.390
AND MY MOM AND I WOULD GET THEIR

00:32:39.457 --> 00:32:40.658
AFTER BEING ENROLLED IN SCHOOL

00:32:40.725 --> 00:32:43.261
OVER IN ARIZONA FOR SIX OR FIVE

00:32:43.328 --> 00:32:43.695
MONTHS.

00:32:43.761 --> 00:32:45.263
IT WOULD BE TIME TO MOVE BACK TO

00:32:45.330 --> 00:32:46.731
SALINAS.

00:32:46.798 --> 00:32:48.333
MY SISTER AND I WOULD AND FORMER

00:32:48.399 --> 00:32:50.034
TEACHERS PACKER THINGS THEIR

00:32:50.101 --> 00:32:51.602
GOODBYES AND DRIVE DOWN TO

00:32:51.669 --> 00:32:53.805
HIGHWAY EIGHT BACK TO SALINAS.

00:32:53.871 --> 00:32:55.106
IT WAS A CYCLE THAT TO THIS DAY

00:32:55.173 --> 00:32:57.241
MY BODY FEELS EVERY WINTER AND

00:32:57.308 --> 00:32:58.976
EVERY SPRING.

00:32:59.043 --> 00:33:00.378
AT AROUND THE FOURTH GRADE I

00:33:00.445 --> 00:33:02.046
REALIZE THAT I DIDN'T KNOW HOW

00:33:02.113 --> 00:33:03.314
TO READ WELL.

00:33:03.381 --> 00:33:05.416
I HAD LOW GRADES WAS TERRIBLE AT

00:33:05.483 --> 00:33:06.984
MATH AND AS A RESULT OF

00:33:07.051 --> 00:33:08.553
MIGRATING AND THE EDUCATIONAL

00:33:08.619 --> 00:33:10.755
INCONSISTENCIES I GOT BEHIND ON

00:33:10.822 --> 00:33:12.790
MY MAJOR SUBJECTS.

00:33:12.857 --> 00:33:14.158
IT WAS THE MIGRANT PROGRAM THE

00:33:14.225 --> 00:33:15.493
BILINGUAL PROGRAM AND AFTER

00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:17.462
SCHOOL PROGRAMS AND MY MOM THAT

00:33:17.528 --> 00:33:18.896
GOT ME THROUGH MY ELEMENTARY

00:33:18.963 --> 00:33:21.099
SCHOOL EDUCATION.

00:33:21.165 --> 00:33:23.067
FAST FORWARD TO MY SOPHOMORE

00:33:23.134 --> 00:33:24.535
YEAR IN HIGH SCHOOL.

00:33:24.602 --> 00:33:26.137
I KNOW I WANTED TO GO TO COLLEGE

00:33:26.204 --> 00:33:27.171
AND I LEARNED ABOUT THE

00:33:27.238 --> 00:33:28.606
OPPORTUNITIES THROUGH THE GIRLS

00:33:28.673 --> 00:33:30.141
INC PROGRAM.

00:33:30.208 --> 00:33:31.642
GIRLS THINK EMPOWERED MANY OF US

00:33:31.709 --> 00:33:34.445
YOUNG LATINO WOMEN IN MANY WAYS.

00:33:34.512 --> 00:33:35.980
THEY DID WORKSHOPS FIRST TO

00:33:36.047 --> 00:33:37.448
LEARN ABOUT DIFFERENT CAREERS

00:33:37.515 --> 00:33:38.416
THEY BROUGHT AN ATTORNEY WHO

00:33:38.483 --> 00:33:39.584
SPOKE TO US ABOUT PUBLIC

00:33:39.650 --> 00:33:40.618
INTEREST WORK.

00:33:40.685 --> 00:33:42.053
AND THEY TOOK US TO DIFFERENT

00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:43.588
UNIVERSITIES.

00:33:43.654 --> 00:33:45.289
UC DAVIS INCLUDED.

00:33:45.356 --> 00:33:47.125
THE MENTORS OF GIRLS AND TAUGHT

00:33:47.191 --> 00:33:49.227
US ABOUT SELF CARE SELF.

00:33:49.293 --> 00:33:51.629
OF GOAL SETTING AND SELF GROWTH

00:33:51.696 --> 00:33:53.331
EVENTUALLY I GRADUATED FROM

00:33:53.398 --> 00:33:55.433
NORTH SALINAS HIGH SCHOOL IN TWO

00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:56.067
THOUSAND ELEVEN I WAS ACCEPTED

00:33:56.134 --> 00:33:57.268
INTO ST MARY'S COLLEGE OF

00:33:57.335 --> 00:33:59.203
CALIFORNIA.

00:33:59.270 --> 00:34:00.037
EVEN THOUGH I EXCELLED IN

00:34:00.104 --> 00:34:01.839
COLLEGE IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT

00:34:01.906 --> 00:34:03.074
BECAUSE I FUNDED MY WAY THROUGH

00:34:03.141 --> 00:34:04.876
IT ON MY OWN.

00:34:04.942 --> 00:34:06.844
CORRECT THREE OR TWO JOBS EVERY

00:34:06.911 --> 00:34:09.647
SEMESTER TO MAKE ENDS MEET.

00:34:09.714 --> 00:34:10.715
I WORKED AS AN ADMINISTRATIVE

00:34:10.782 --> 00:34:13.518
SAID AT ADMINISTRATIVE SECRETARY.

00:34:13.584 --> 00:34:15.586
BABYSITTER TRANSLATOR ZOOM BUT

00:34:15.653 --> 00:34:19.924
TEACHER AND POLICY CONSULTANT.

00:34:19.991 --> 00:34:20.591
THAT'S HOW I COULD AFFORD TO PAY

00:34:20.658 --> 00:34:21.159
RENT.

00:34:21.225 --> 00:34:23.327
IN BETWEEN JOBS I WENT TO CLASS

00:34:23.394 --> 00:34:25.163
AND THE WRITING CENTER.

00:34:25.229 --> 00:34:26.998
I NEVER KNEW A PRIVATE TUTOR BUT

00:34:27.064 --> 00:34:28.599
I USE THE RESOURCES ON CAMPUS AS

00:34:28.666 --> 00:34:29.901
BEST AS I COULD.

00:34:29.967 --> 00:34:31.335
I CONSTANTLY APPLIED FOR

00:34:31.402 --> 00:34:33.237
SCHOLARSHIPS SO THAT MY PARENTS

00:34:33.304 --> 00:34:35.072
WOULDN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT.

00:34:35.139 --> 00:34:36.774
ME AND COULD SUPPORT MY TWO

00:34:36.841 --> 00:34:40.178
YOUNGER SISTERS.

00:34:40.244 --> 00:34:41.245
BUT THERE IS ALSO ANOTHER VERY

00:34:41.312 --> 00:34:44.115
IMPORTANT IMPORTANT PERSON IN MY

00:34:44.182 --> 00:34:46.384
ST MARY'S COLLEGE CAREER.

00:34:46.451 --> 00:34:47.552
IT WAS MY PROFESSOR MYRNA

00:34:47.618 --> 00:34:49.987
SANTIAGO WHO WAS THE THE

00:34:50.054 --> 00:34:51.756
DIRECTOR OF THE HISTORY PROGRAM

00:34:51.823 --> 00:34:53.724
SHE WAS MY MENTOR TOOK ME UNDER

00:34:53.791 --> 00:34:55.960
MY TOOK ME UNDER HER WING.

00:34:56.027 --> 00:34:59.831
AND TAUGHT ME HOW TO WRITE WELL.

00:34:59.897 --> 00:35:01.332
THE MOST DIFFICULT PART OF GOING

00:35:01.399 --> 00:35:02.667
TO COLLEGE WAS PROBABLY

00:35:02.733 --> 00:35:04.202
TRANSITIONING TO AND FROM

00:35:04.268 --> 00:35:05.570
BECAUSE I WAS AND I WAS THE

00:35:05.636 --> 00:35:07.405
FIRST IN MY FAMILY TO ATTEND

00:35:07.472 --> 00:35:09.040
COLLEGE AND GRADUATE FROM IT.

00:35:09.106 --> 00:35:10.341
NO ONE IN MY FAMILY HAD

00:35:10.408 --> 00:35:11.476
GRADUATED HIGH SCHOOL IN THE

00:35:11.542 --> 00:35:13.945
UNITED STATES SO THERE WAS NO

00:35:14.011 --> 00:35:14.579
ONE I COULD REACH OUT.

00:35:14.645 --> 00:35:16.814
TO BUT THERE WAS.

00:35:16.881 --> 00:35:18.282
BUT THERE WAS ALWAYS MY PARENTS

00:35:18.349 --> 00:35:23.187
WERE WILLING TO SUPPORT ME.

00:35:23.254 --> 00:35:25.122
AND THEN I A ALSO REACHED OUT TO

00:35:25.189 --> 00:35:27.158
PROFESSOR MANA SANTIAGO TO TALK

00:35:27.225 --> 00:35:28.626

00:35:28.693 --> 00:35:31.062
SHE RECOMMENDED A PROGRAM.

00:35:31.128 --> 00:35:32.930

OUT REACH PROGRAM AT UC DAVIS

00:35:35.666 --> 00:35:38.302
THIS PROGRAM.

00:35:38.369 --> 00:35:39.604
WAS A PERFECT PROGRAM FOR ME

00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:41.205
BECAUSE I WAS ABLE TO LEARN

00:35:41.272 --> 00:35:42.807

AND HOW TO GET INTO LAW SCHOOL.

00:35:46.143 --> 00:35:47.478
I KNEW THAT I WANTED TO GO INTO

00:35:47.545 --> 00:35:49.080
LAW SCHOOL BECAUSE I HAD SEEN A

00:35:49.146 --> 00:35:51.282
LOT OF THE INEQUALITIES THAT MY

00:35:51.349 --> 00:35:52.617
PARENTS FACED WHILE THEY WERE

00:35:52.683 --> 00:35:53.951

00:35:54.018 --> 00:35:57.021
I I KNEW THAT.

00:35:57.088 --> 00:35:58.756
THEY WERE WORKING LOW INCOME

00:35:58.823 --> 00:36:00.358

INDIVIDUAL REPRESENTATION

00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:08.986
LITIGATION AND LEGISLATION.

00:38:09.053 --> 00:38:10.187
IT IS IMPORTANT THAT PERSONS

00:38:10.254 --> 00:38:11.489
WITH DISABILITIES ARE

00:38:11.555 --> 00:38:13.691
REPRESENTED IN LAW SCHOOLS IN

00:38:13.758 --> 00:38:15.192
THE BAR AND ON THE BENCH.

00:38:15.259 --> 00:38:16.727
BECAUSE OUR EXPERIENCE AND POINT

00:38:16.794 --> 00:38:18.663
OF VIEW MATTER.

00:38:18.729 --> 00:38:20.164
ACCORDING TO THE US CENSUS

00:38:20.231 --> 00:38:22.633
BUREAU ABOUT 19% OF THE

00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:25.169
POPULATION HAD A DISABILITY IN

00:38:25.236 --> 00:38:25.770
TWO THOUSAND TEN IN THE UNITED

00:38:25.836 --> 00:38:27.038
STATES.

00:38:27.104 --> 00:38:28.439
THERE ARE THREE MAIN ISSUES

00:38:28.506 --> 00:38:30.841
INVOLVING DISABILITYDIVERSITY

00:38:30.908 --> 00:38:32.309
IN THE LAW.

00:38:32.376 --> 00:38:35.446
FIRST WE HAVE A PIPELINE PROBLEM.

00:38:35.513 --> 00:38:36.414
WHERE INDIVIDUALS WITH

00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:38.182
DISABILITIES ARE LESS LIKELY TO

00:38:38.249 --> 00:38:39.884
APPLY AND BE ADMITTED TO LAW

00:38:39.950 --> 00:38:41.218
SCHOOL?

00:38:41.285 --> 00:38:43.721
ONLY TWELVE POINT 3% OF WORKING

00:38:43.788 --> 00:38:45.723
AGE PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES

00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:46.657
HELD A BACHELOR'S DEGREE OR

00:38:46.724 --> 00:38:48.392
HIGHER.

00:38:48.459 --> 00:38:50.861
COMPARED TO THIRTY POINT 6% OF

00:38:50.928 --> 00:38:52.897
NON DISABLED PERSONS.

00:38:52.963 --> 00:38:54.965
SECOND THERE IS ALSO A STRONG

00:38:55.032 --> 00:38:57.702
DISABILITY POVERTY CORRELATION.

00:38:57.768 --> 00:38:58.469
MANY INDIVIDUALS WITH

00:38:58.536 --> 00:39:00.438
DISABILITIES ARE NOT ABLE TO

00:39:00.504 --> 00:39:02.907
FINANCE LAW SCHOOL AT ALL.

00:39:02.973 --> 00:39:05.309
THIRD THE NUMBER OF LAWYERS WITH

00:39:05.376 --> 00:39:06.711
DISABILITIES IT'S HARD TO

00:39:06.777 --> 00:39:08.212
DETERMINE.

00:39:08.279 --> 00:39:11.682
UNLIKE RACE GENDER ETHNICITY AND

00:39:11.749 --> 00:39:14.118
MORE RECENTLY SEXUAL ORIENTATION

00:39:14.185 --> 00:39:15.586
THERE IS LITTLE REPORTING ON

00:39:15.653 --> 00:39:18.422
DISABILITY STATISTICS.

00:39:18.489 --> 00:39:20.257
PAST ABA PRESIDENT WILLIAM

00:39:20.324 --> 00:39:22.460
NEUKOM STATED IN HIS PRESIDENT'S

00:39:22.526 --> 00:39:23.794
MESSAGE THAT ALTHOUGH IT IS

00:39:23.861 --> 00:39:25.763
DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE THE EXACT

00:39:25.830 --> 00:39:26.931
DEGREE.

00:39:26.997 --> 00:39:28.399
THAT THE DISABILITY COMMUNITY IS

00:39:28.466 --> 00:39:29.767
UNDER REPRESENTED IN THE LEGAL

00:39:29.834 --> 00:39:32.403
COMMUNITY IT IS EVIDENT THAT

00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:33.971
LAWYERS WITH DISABILITIES.

00:39:34.038 --> 00:39:35.906
TO HAVE GREATER DIFFICULTY

00:39:35.973 --> 00:39:37.441
GETTING A JOB AFTER LAW SCHOOL.

00:39:37.508 --> 00:39:38.776
AND HAVE HIGHER RATES OF

00:39:38.843 --> 00:39:40.778
UNEMPLOYMENT THE LAWYERS WHO DO

00:39:40.845 --> 00:39:43.013
NOT HAVE DISABILITIES.

00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:44.115
MANY LAWYERS WITH DISABILITIES

00:39:44.181 --> 00:39:46.083
STILL END UP WHERE THEY ALWAYS

00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:48.486
HAVE.

00:39:48.552 --> 00:39:50.087
CHANNEL TOWARD GOVERNMENT WORK

00:39:50.154 --> 00:39:52.623
ADVOCACY ORGANIZATIONS OR SOLO

00:39:52.690 --> 00:39:54.859
IN SMALL FIRM EMPLOYMENT.

00:39:54.925 --> 00:39:56.460
OFTEN WITH DISABILITY RELATED

00:39:56.527 --> 00:39:57.895
PRACTICES.

00:39:57.962 --> 00:39:59.897
OLD ATTITUDES AND PERCEPTIONS OF

00:39:59.964 --> 00:40:01.532
PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES HAVE

00:40:01.599 --> 00:40:03.768
BEEN SLOW TO CHANGE.

00:40:03.834 --> 00:40:05.002
ADDITIONALLY.

00:40:05.069 --> 00:40:06.804
DEAR SEE ADVOCATES FOR

00:40:06.871 --> 00:40:08.472
INCREASING THE NUMBER OF

00:40:08.539 --> 00:40:10.608
JUDICIAL APPOINTMENTS OF PEOPLE

00:40:10.674 --> 00:40:12.676
WITH DISABILITIES IN CALIFORNIA.

00:40:12.743 --> 00:40:14.078
SO THAT THE BENCH CAN BE BETTER

00:40:14.145 --> 00:40:15.913
REFLECTIVE OF CALIFORNIA'S

00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:17.581
POPULATION OF PERSONS WITH

00:40:17.648 --> 00:40:21.085
DISABILITIES.

00:40:21.152 --> 00:40:22.286
WELL THERE HAS BEEN IMPROVEMENT

00:40:22.353 --> 00:40:23.888
AND ETHNIC AND OTHER DIVERSITY

00:40:23.954 --> 00:40:25.589
GROUPS THAT IS NOT TRUE OF

00:40:25.656 --> 00:40:27.691
PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES.

00:40:27.758 --> 00:40:29.160
THERE ARE THIRTEEN TOTAL JUDGES

00:40:29.226 --> 00:40:31.896
OR 2% OF CALIFORNIAN JUDGES WHO

00:40:31.962 --> 00:40:33.097
HAVE IDENTIFIED WITH HAVING A

00:40:33.164 --> 00:40:34.865
DISABILITY.

00:40:34.932 --> 00:40:36.367
LAWYERS AND JUDGES ARE CHANGE

00:40:36.433 --> 00:40:39.036
AGENTS FOR ENTIRE COMMUNITIES.

00:40:39.103 --> 00:40:40.538
PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES BRING A

00:40:40.604 --> 00:40:42.640
PERSPECTIVE AN OUTLOOK THAT IS

00:40:42.706 --> 00:40:44.341
UNIQUE AND IMPORTANT.

00:40:44.408 --> 00:40:45.409
THEY CAN ALSO ENHANCE THE

00:40:45.476 --> 00:40:46.577
ENVIRONMENT.

00:40:46.644 --> 00:40:48.312
THROUGH OTHERS AND HELP WORK

00:40:48.379 --> 00:40:49.747
THROUGH THE PIPELINE OF LAW

00:40:49.814 --> 00:40:51.148
SCHOOL THE BAR EXAM.

00:40:51.215 --> 00:40:52.449
THE LEGAL PROFESSION AND THE

00:40:52.516 --> 00:40:54.385
JUDICIARY.

00:40:54.451 --> 00:40:57.955
MY EXPERIENCE I AM RARE.

00:40:58.022 --> 00:40:59.490
MY LAW SCHOOL HAD APPROXIMATELY

00:40:59.557 --> 00:41:01.325
FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS.

00:41:01.392 --> 00:41:02.960
I WAS THE ONLY INDIVIDUAL WHO

00:41:03.027 --> 00:41:03.527
USED TO WILSHIRE AT THAT LAW

00:41:03.594 --> 00:41:05.563
SCHOOL.

00:41:05.629 --> 00:41:07.264
LAW SCHOOL AS WE ALL KNOW IS

00:41:07.331 --> 00:41:09.466
CHALLENGING ON ITS OWN.

00:41:09.533 --> 00:41:11.669
READING AND ANALYZING CASES

00:41:11.735 --> 00:41:13.804
DOESN'T EXACTLY COME NATURALLY.

00:41:13.871 --> 00:41:15.406
I ALSO HAD TO DEAL WITH THE

00:41:15.472 --> 00:41:17.608
ADDED STRESS OR BURDEN OF BEING

00:41:17.675 --> 00:41:19.343
THE DISABLED REPRESENTATIVE OR

00:41:19.410 --> 00:41:21.946
PERSON WITH EIGHTY A PERSPECTIVE.

00:41:22.012 --> 00:41:23.948
I DID NOT HAVE COLLEAGUES THAT I

00:41:24.014 --> 00:41:26.116
COULD SHARE THAT EXPERIENCE WITH.

00:41:26.183 --> 00:41:27.685
IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR ME TO

00:41:27.751 --> 00:41:28.953
NAVIGATE THROUGH LAW SCHOOL

00:41:29.019 --> 00:41:30.321
WITHOUT OTHER STUDENTS AND

00:41:30.387 --> 00:41:32.022
FACULTY WHO HAD SIMILAR

00:41:32.089 --> 00:41:34.091
EXPERIENCES AS ME.

00:41:34.158 --> 00:41:35.759
ADDING TO MY OBSTACLE COURSE

00:41:35.826 --> 00:41:37.294
THAT IS DISABILITY I AM AN

00:41:37.361 --> 00:41:39.396
AFRICAN AMERICAN MALE.

00:41:39.463 --> 00:41:40.564
THE INTERSECTION ALLEY OF

00:41:40.631 --> 00:41:42.800
DISABILITY AND RACE CAN ADD EVEN

00:41:42.867 --> 00:41:44.368
MORE CHALLENGES.

00:41:44.435 --> 00:41:46.203
THE SPACE WAS DIFFICULT TO

00:41:46.270 --> 00:41:46.737
UNDERGO WHILE I WAS IN LAW

00:41:46.804 --> 00:41:48.072

00:52:06.556 --> 00:52:08.558
MY STORY.

00:52:08.625 --> 00:52:09.826
AND EVEN PUT IT ON MY STORY

00:52:09.893 --> 00:52:12.362
BECAUSE IT'S NOT MY STORY.

00:52:12.429 --> 00:52:15.165
IT'S THE STORY OF SO MANY OTHERS.

00:52:15.232 --> 00:52:17.467
THE FACT OF THE MATTER.

00:52:17.534 --> 00:52:19.269
IS THAT NO ONE THOUGHT THAT I

00:52:19.336 --> 00:52:21.404
WOULD BE HERE TODAY.

00:52:21.471 --> 00:52:22.506
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT

00:52:22.572 --> 00:52:24.474
WHEN I WAS HAVING MY EDUCATION

00:52:24.541 --> 00:52:26.543
IN SANTA ANA.

00:52:26.610 --> 00:52:29.379
AND I FLUNKED SECOND GRADE.

00:52:29.446 --> 00:52:31.014
AND I WAS TOLD WHAT CLASSES I

00:52:31.081 --> 00:52:32.148
BELONG.

00:52:32.215 --> 00:52:33.517
TO AND WHERE I HAD TO ASK IN

00:52:33.583 --> 00:52:35.819
FIFTH GRADE. TO BE PLACED IN A

00:52:35.886 --> 00:52:37.921
BETTER ENGLISH READING CLASS THE

00:52:37.988 --> 00:52:39.256
ULTIMATELY WAS WHAT OPEN THE

00:52:39.322 --> 00:52:40.223
DOORS AND GAVE ME THE

00:52:40.290 --> 00:52:42.492
OPPORTUNITIES THAT I HAVE TO

00:52:42.559 --> 00:52:43.994
THIS DAY.

00:52:44.060 --> 00:52:45.295
IT WAS.

00:52:45.362 --> 00:52:46.229
A TEN YEAR OLD KID ASKING FOR

00:52:46.296 --> 00:52:48.598
THAT OPPORTUNITY.

00:52:48.665 --> 00:52:49.766
AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT WHEN I

00:52:49.833 --> 00:52:51.735
WAS ULTIMATELY PLACED IN GAVE

00:52:51.801 --> 00:52:52.702
CLASSES GIFTED AND TALENTED

00:52:52.769 --> 00:52:54.070
EDUCATION.

00:52:54.137 --> 00:52:56.139
AND I COULDN'T PASS THE TEST

00:52:56.206 --> 00:52:57.807
BECAUSE I DIDN'T GROW UP

00:52:57.874 --> 00:52:58.108
[inaudible]

00:52:58.174 --> 00:52:59.843
WITH PUZZLES.

00:52:59.910 --> 00:53:03.780
WITH CREATIVE THINKING SKILLS.

00:53:03.847 --> 00:53:05.282
I WAS GOING TO TAKE IT OUT OF

00:53:05.348 --> 00:53:06.383
THAT CLASS.

00:53:06.449 --> 00:53:07.417
BUT IT WAS MY MOTHER WITH A

00:53:07.484 --> 00:53:09.119
SIXTH GRADE EDUCATION THAT

00:53:09.185 --> 00:53:10.720
MARCHED INTO THE SCHOOL AS THAT

00:53:10.787 --> 00:53:12.289
IF SHE CAN DO THE WORK THAT SHE

00:53:12.355 --> 00:53:13.924
SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO REMAIN.

00:53:13.990 --> 00:53:15.525
AND SO I REMAINED IN THOSE

00:53:15.592 --> 00:53:17.494
CLASSES AND IT'S BECAUSE OF THAT

00:53:17.561 --> 00:53:19.229
THAT I HAD HONORS CLASSES AND AB

00:53:19.296 --> 00:53:20.030
CLASSES.

00:53:20.096 --> 00:53:20.697
BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT IN HIGH

00:53:20.764 --> 00:53:22.866
SCHOOL MY ENGLISH MY A. P.

00:53:22.933 --> 00:53:24.501
ENGLISH TEACHER.

00:53:24.568 --> 00:53:27.504
TOLD FIVE OF THE CLASS MEMBERS

00:53:27.571 --> 00:53:29.205
THAT THEY COULD PASS THE TEST

00:53:29.272 --> 00:53:31.141
AND AT THE REST OF US COULD NOT.

00:53:31.207 --> 00:53:32.542
AND SO MANY OF THE STUDENTS

00:53:32.609 --> 00:53:34.244
STOPPED GOING TO CLASS.

00:53:34.311 --> 00:53:35.445
I WOULD SHOW UP.

00:53:35.512 --> 00:53:37.080
AND I WOULD DO MY HOMEWORK FOR

00:53:37.147 --> 00:53:38.915
OTHER CLASSES.

00:53:38.982 --> 00:53:40.884
I WAS OFTEN TRIED PEOPLE OFTEN

00:53:40.951 --> 00:53:42.552
TRY TO DEFINE.

00:53:42.619 --> 00:53:43.987
IF I TELL ME WHAT I COULD AND

00:53:44.054 --> 00:53:45.355
WHAT I COULD NOT DO.

00:53:45.422 --> 00:53:46.723
I CAN TELL YOU THAT WHEN I

00:53:46.790 --> 00:53:48.692
APPLIED TO COLLEGE.

00:53:48.758 --> 00:53:50.193
THE BEST OF MY CANCER COULD

WHAT WE APPLIED.

00:56:48.772 --> 00:56:49.339
I THINK I WAS THE ONLY ONE THAT

00:56:49.405 --> 00:56:49.973
A FLIGHT.

00:56:50.039 --> 00:56:52.075

PEDIGREE.

00:57:04.954 --> 00:57:06.623

00:57:06.689 --> 00:57:07.991
APPLY ANYWAY.

00:57:08.057 --> 00:57:11.427

SUPERIOR COURT JUDGE.

00:57:24.574 --> 00:57:26.676
I CAN TELL YOU THAT I'M ONE OF

00:57:26.743 --> 00:57:27.977
FOR LATINOS THAT CURRENTLY SIT

00:57:28.044 --> 00:57:29.279
ON THE BENCH OF THE ORANGE

00:57:29.345 --> 00:57:30.780
COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT.

00:57:30.847 --> 00:57:33.183

00:57:36.653 --> 00:57:37.520
JUDGE.

00:57:37.587 --> 00:57:39.889
AND THAT SIX YEARS INTO MY

00:57:39.956 --> 00:57:41.858
PRACTICE I'M ON THE FELONY TRIAL

00:57:41.925 --> 00:57:44.160
PANEL WHICH GENERALLY DOESN'T

00:57:44.227 --> 00:57:44.828
HAPPEN.

00:57:44.894 --> 00:57:45.895
AND THE REASON WHY I SAY ALL OF

00:57:45.962 --> 00:57:47.497
THIS AND I KNOW THAT MY MOTHER

00:57:47.564 --> 00:57:48.665
TAUGHT ME HUMILITY.

00:57:48.731 --> 00:57:49.766
BUT IT'S BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT

00:57:49.833 --> 00:57:51.167
TO TELL OUR STORY BECAUSE IT'S

00:57:51.234 --> 00:57:52.735

00:57:54.904 --> 00:57:56.673
BENCH.

00:57:56.739 --> 00:57:58.608
AND SO I CLOSE WITH THIS.

00:57:58.675 --> 00:58:00.577
AS THE JUDGE FIRST AND FOREMOST

00:58:00.643 --> 00:58:02.645
I APPLY THE LAW.

00:58:02.712 --> 00:58:04.013
I CONSIDER MYSELF A WISE LATINA.

00:58:04.080 --> 00:58:05.348
I HOPE THAT THE RICHNESS OF MY

00:58:05.415 --> 00:58:07.283
EXPERIENCE MORE OFTEN THAN NOT

00:58:07.350 --> 00:58:08.551
HELP ME REACH A BETTER

00:58:08.618 --> 00:58:09.719
CONCLUSION [inaudible]

00:58:09.786 --> 00:58:13.022
THANK YOU.

00:58:13.089 --> 00:58:14.524
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:58:14.591 --> 00:58:17.060
ALL RIGHT I'M GONNA OPEN UP FOR

00:58:17.126 --> 00:58:19.062
QUESTIONS AND FIRST OF ALL THIS

00:58:19.128 --> 00:58:19.863
BUT THE RATHER.

00:58:19.929 --> 00:58:21.030
AND REALIZE YOU WITH GIRLS THINK

00:58:21.097 --> 00:58:22.365
THE LAST TIME.

00:58:22.432 --> 00:58:23.600
I INTERACTED WITH THEM WAS

00:58:23.666 --> 00:58:25.301
EARLIER THIS WINTER AND THEY

00:58:25.368 --> 00:58:26.669
CAME UP INTO THIS HEARING ROOM.

00:58:26.736 --> 00:58:28.771
AND I GOT A CHANCE TO TALK TO

00:58:28.838 --> 00:58:30.707
THEM AND I THINK APROPOS.

00:58:30.773 --> 00:58:33.076
THE THE CHALLENGES THEY FACE

00:58:33.142 --> 00:58:34.444
THAT YOU FACE AND ESPECIALLY.

00:58:34.510 --> 00:58:35.612
THAT THE TWO OF YOU ARE NOT

00:58:35.678 --> 00:58:37.513
CHALLENGES THAT I FACED BEING

00:58:37.580 --> 00:58:39.782
WHITE BEING MALE.

00:58:39.849 --> 00:58:41.284
THAT THAT'S KIND OF THE CLASSIC

00:58:41.351 --> 00:58:42.785
PRIVILEGE AND I THINK THAT'S WHY

00:58:42.852 --> 00:58:44.888
IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ALL NEED

00:58:44.954 --> 00:58:46.489
TO BE VERY COGNIZANT OF BUT I

00:58:46.556 --> 00:58:47.957
ASKED THE GIRLS TO COME UP AND

00:58:48.024 --> 00:58:49.125
SIT UP HERE.

00:58:49.192 --> 00:58:50.927
AS OPPOSED TO OUT THERE.

00:58:50.994 --> 00:58:52.929
BECAUSE IF YOU CAN'T ENVISION

00:58:52.996 --> 00:58:54.898
YOURSELF IN A ROLE.

00:58:54.964 --> 00:58:56.933
THEN YOU CLOSE THOSE DOORS

00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:58.134
ESPECIALLY WITH OTHERS TELLING

00:58:58.201 --> 00:59:00.870
YOU YOU'RE NOT QUALIFIED OR

00:59:00.937 --> 00:59:02.138
YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO GET THERE.

00:59:02.205 --> 00:59:04.107
SO I THINK THAT'S FOR ALL OF US

00:59:04.173 --> 00:59:04.707
TO REMEMBER AND MAKE SURE THAT

00:59:04.774 --> 00:59:08.111
WE'RE GIVING KIDS IN STUDENTS.

00:59:08.177 --> 00:59:09.012
THAT OPPORTUNITY TO ENVISION

00:59:09.078 --> 00:59:11.080
THEMSELVES.

00:59:11.147 --> 00:59:13.216
WHERE THEY DREAM OR OR WHAT'S

00:59:13.283 --> 00:59:15.985
POSSIBLE OTHERWISE THEY DON'T?

00:59:16.052 --> 00:59:18.855
GO UP THERE SO BUT UP ONE OF THE

00:59:18.922 --> 00:59:21.190
THINGS THAT THAT CAME UP AND

00:59:21.257 --> 00:59:22.358
MISTER HARRIS MRS VERY THE YOU

BOTH BROUGHT UP WITH DATA.

00:59:23.626 --> 00:59:26.262
AND DATA COLLECTION AND THE FACT

00:59:26.329 --> 00:59:27.330
THAT WE'RE NOT COLLECTING A LOT

00:59:27.397 --> 00:59:28.898
OF DATA AND OTHERS THAT WORK

00:59:28.965 --> 00:59:29.899
THAT'S BEING DONE AROUND IT.

00:59:29.966 --> 00:59:32.802
BUT YOU ALSO AN INTEGRATED.

00:59:32.869 --> 00:59:34.570
IF WE'RE GONNA COLLECT DATA

00:59:34.637 --> 00:59:38.107
THERE IS STIGMA IN GLBT AND IN

00:59:38.174 --> 00:59:39.776
THE DISABILITY COMMUNITY.

00:59:39.842 --> 00:59:42.645
HOW CAN WE MAKE SURE THAT?

00:59:42.712 --> 00:59:44.414
AS WE COLLECT DATA AS WE REALLY

00:59:44.480 --> 00:59:47.350
THAT THAT WE'RE ABLE TO GET.

00:59:47.417 --> 00:59:50.086
TO THE TRUTH OF WHO PEOPLE ARE

00:59:50.153 --> 00:59:52.622
AND AND GET THAT WILLING.

00:59:52.689 --> 00:59:54.724
TO RISE ABOVE THAT STIGMA AND

00:59:54.791 --> 00:59:56.726
AND BE COUNTED CORRECTLY SO THAT

00:59:56.793 --> 00:59:59.128
WE CAN TRACK AND UNDERSTAND AND

00:59:59.195 --> 01:00:00.463
THEN KNOW THAT HELPS US

01:00:00.530 --> 01:00:01.564
UNDERSTAND WHERE OUR PROBLEMS

01:00:01.631 --> 01:00:03.399
ARE.

01:00:03.466 --> 01:00:05.802
SO IF IF BOTH YOU CAN HELP WITH

01:00:05.868 --> 01:00:07.537
THAT QUESTION [inaudible]

01:00:07.603 --> 01:00:10.039
MR -- THANK YOU FOR THAT

01:00:10.106 --> 01:00:11.107
QUESTION -- THAT QUESTION

01:00:11.174 --> 01:00:12.542
ACTUALLY GETS BROUGHT UP A LOT

01:00:12.608 --> 01:00:16.980
AND ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT --

01:00:17.046 --> 01:00:18.514
THINGS TO REMEMBER IS THAT

01:00:18.581 --> 01:00:21.417
PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES -- JUST

01:00:21.484 --> 01:00:23.753
LIKE THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY DO NOT

01:00:23.820 --> 01:00:25.822
HAVE TO DISCLOSE -- THAT IS A

01:00:25.888 --> 01:00:29.926
PERSONAL DECISION -- AND THAT IS

01:00:29.993 --> 01:00:31.594
ONE THAT IS OFTEN VERY VERY

01:00:31.661 --> 01:00:33.262
CHALLENGING ESPECIALLY IF YOU

01:00:33.329 --> 01:00:35.298
HAVE A AN INTELLECTUAL

01:00:35.365 --> 01:00:37.033
DISABILITY -- PSYCHOLOGICAL

01:00:37.100 --> 01:00:40.770
DISABILITY MENTAL -- HEALTH --

01:00:40.837 --> 01:00:42.839
DISORDER OF HOWEVER IN MY

01:00:42.905 --> 01:00:45.875
OPINION OF THE LEGAL COMMUNITY

01:00:45.942 --> 01:00:48.344
CAN DO ITS BEST TO BE AS

01:00:48.411 --> 01:00:50.580
WELCOMING AS POSSIBLE -- HAVE

01:00:50.646 --> 01:00:52.515
THE TYPE OF ATTITUDE AND

01:00:52.582 --> 01:00:54.617
WELCOMING ENVIRONMENT -- THAT

01:00:54.684 --> 01:00:55.618
PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES WOULD

01:00:55.685 --> 01:00:58.955
WANT -- TO APPROACH WOULD --

01:00:59.022 --> 01:00:59.956
EMBRACE.

01:01:00.023 --> 01:01:01.858
AND WOULD FEEL EMBRACED -- I

01:01:01.924 --> 01:01:04.427
BELIEVE THAT HAVING OF

01:01:04.494 --> 01:01:05.995
INDIVIDUALS IN THE LEGAL

01:01:06.062 --> 01:01:07.263
PROFESSION OR AROUND THE LEGAL

01:01:07.330 --> 01:01:10.433
PROFESSION ON THE JUDICIARY --

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:12.402
WHO ARE COMFORTABLE AND AT PEACE

01:01:12.468 --> 01:01:15.271
WITH WHO THEY ARE OF AND ABLE TO

01:01:15.338 --> 01:01:17.907
TELL THEIR STORIES -- IT WILL.

01:01:17.974 --> 01:01:19.375
INVITE A LOT OF PEOPLE WITH

01:01:19.442 --> 01:01:23.346
DISABILITIES -- TO BE MORE OPEN --

01:01:23.413 --> 01:01:25.615
ABOUT WHO THEY ARE -- AND KNOW

01:01:25.681 --> 01:01:27.016
THAT THEIR TRUTH AND THEIR

01:01:27.083 --> 01:01:28.418
EXPERIENCES ARE IMPORTANT AND

01:01:28.484 --> 01:01:30.853
WILL BE TAKING OF INTO ACCOUNT

01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:34.223
WHEN THEY GO TO LAW SCHOOL OR

01:01:34.290 --> 01:01:36.626
INTO THE LEGAL PROFESSION

01:01:36.692 --> 01:01:36.926
[inaudible]

01:01:36.993 --> 01:01:38.461
THANK YOU.

01:01:38.528 --> 01:01:39.395
FROM MY PERSPECTIVE I MEAN THE

01:01:39.462 --> 01:01:40.963
FIRST STEP IS TO ACTUALLY ASK

01:01:41.030 --> 01:01:42.899
VOLUNTARY QUESTIONS ON ALL FORMS

01:01:42.965 --> 01:01:44.233
IT'S NOT HAPPENING IN CALIFORNIA

01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:45.835
I THINK WE HAVE THREE AREAS

01:01:45.902 --> 01:01:46.903
WHERE.

01:01:46.969 --> 01:01:48.271
IT'S HAPPENING WHICH IS THEN THE

01:01:48.337 --> 01:01:49.639
HEALTH AREA EMPLOYMENT AND

01:01:49.705 --> 01:01:52.809
EDUCATION NOW -- BUT REALLY IT'S

01:01:52.875 --> 01:01:53.643
YOU KNOW EVEN THOUGH NOW BECAUSE

01:01:53.709 --> 01:01:54.277
BEEN.

01:01:54.343 --> 01:01:56.979
ASKING ABOUT -- SEGMENTATION

01:01:57.046 --> 01:01:58.815
GENDER DAILY SINCE TWO THOUSAND

01:01:58.881 --> 01:01:59.982
TO THE CALIFORNIA STATE BAR DID

01:02:00.049 --> 01:02:01.751
NOT START ASKING ABOUT THAT

01:02:01.818 --> 01:02:04.454
UNTIL THIS YEAR'S SO -- YOU KNOW

01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:06.222
IT'S IT'S IT'S IMPORTANT THAT

01:02:06.289 --> 01:02:08.658
THAT QUESTION BE ASKED I THINK A

01:02:08.724 --> 01:02:10.026
LOT OF PEOPLE.

01:02:10.093 --> 01:02:11.394
YOU KNOW HAVE THIS SENSE THAT IS

01:02:11.461 --> 01:02:13.496
SOME HOUSE SHAMEFUL TO ASK

01:02:13.563 --> 01:02:14.263
SOMEONE ABOUT THEIR SEXUAL

01:02:14.330 --> 01:02:15.731
ORIENTATION OR GENDER IDENTITY

01:02:15.798 --> 01:02:17.100
AND WE CAN'T.

01:02:17.166 --> 01:02:18.801
WE HAVE TO GET PAST THE STIGMA

01:02:18.868 --> 01:02:22.171
OF THAT BEING A BAD THING -- AND

01:02:22.238 --> 01:02:23.673
SO OBVIOUSLY YOU DON'T WANT TO

01:02:23.739 --> 01:02:25.842
FORCE ANYONE TO EVER ASKED IT'S

01:02:25.908 --> 01:02:26.542
GOT ALWAYS BE A VOLUNTARY

01:02:26.609 --> 01:02:29.178
QUESTION BUT I THINK EVEN JUST

01:02:29.245 --> 01:02:29.812
ASKING THE QUESTION IS THE FIRST

01:02:29.879 --> 01:02:30.279
STEP.

01:02:30.346 --> 01:02:31.547
IF THERE ARE WAYS AND YOU KNOW

01:02:31.614 --> 01:02:32.548
OBVIOUSLY IN A GOVERNMENT

01:02:32.615 --> 01:02:34.317
PROGRAM IT'S HARDER TO SORT OF

01:02:34.383 --> 01:02:35.218
FIGURE THIS OUT BUT WE DO KNOW

01:02:35.284 --> 01:02:37.920
WHEN -- WHEN RESPONSES ARE

01:02:37.987 --> 01:02:40.223
ANONYMOUS ARE SOMEWHAT ANONYMOUS

01:02:40.289 --> 01:02:42.558
THAT THE RESPONSE RATES GO UP --

01:02:42.625 --> 01:02:44.093
WE WERE SHOCKED FRANKLY WHEN WE

01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:46.095
DID OUR POLL IN TWO THOUSAND

01:02:46.162 --> 01:02:46.562
SEVENTEEN AND IT WAS A

01:02:46.629 --> 01:02:47.864
STATISTICALLY VALID POLL OF

01:02:47.930 --> 01:02:48.965
REGISTERED VOTERS ARE SUBTLE

01:02:49.031 --> 01:02:50.366
PUBLIC BUT IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S A

01:02:50.433 --> 01:02:51.667
PRETTY GOOD SAMPLE OF A LOT OF

01:02:51.734 --> 01:02:54.537
PEOPLE. TO FIND OUT THAT 12% OF

01:02:54.604 --> 01:02:56.205
THE CALIFORNIA RICHARD VOTERS

01:02:56.272 --> 01:02:57.907
IDENTIFIED AS MEMBERS OF THE

01:02:57.974 --> 01:02:59.675
LGBTQ COMMUNITY.

01:02:59.742 --> 01:03:01.577
THAT WAS SHOCKING TO US MOST

01:03:01.644 --> 01:03:02.712
ESTIMATES.

01:03:02.778 --> 01:03:03.980
YOU KNOW THAT ARE OUT THERE ON

01:03:04.046 --> 01:03:05.481
CITIES BEFORE HAD ESTIMATED

01:03:05.548 --> 01:03:07.250
BETWEEN FOUR AND 5% OF PEOPLE

01:03:07.316 --> 01:03:08.484
SELF REPORT.

01:03:08.551 --> 01:03:09.519
A WE HAD ALWAYS ASSUMED THAT

01:03:09.585 --> 01:03:11.154
THAT WAS ABOUT DOUBLE BECAUSE WE

01:03:11.220 --> 01:03:13.222
KNOW THAT STIGMA PARTICULARLY IN

01:03:13.289 --> 01:03:14.457
RURAL COMMUNITIES AND PEOPLE

01:03:14.524 --> 01:03:15.391
THAT ARE COMING FROM

01:03:15.458 --> 01:03:16.259
CONSERVATIVE RELIGIOUS

01:03:16.325 --> 01:03:17.460
BACKGROUNDS.

01:03:17.527 --> 01:03:19.061
OFTEN WILL NOT EVEN THINK OF

01:03:19.128 --> 01:03:20.396
THEMSELVES AS A MEMBER OF THE

01:03:20.463 --> 01:03:21.264

ACTIVITIES TO SOME EXTENT.

01:03:25.401 --> 01:03:27.436

01:06:17.139 --> 01:06:20.009
HE JUST MADE A PERSONAL JUDGE

01:06:20.076 --> 01:06:21.210
MISIA'S THANK YOU.

01:06:21.277 --> 01:06:23.112
FOR HOW YOU SHARE YOUR STORY --

01:06:23.179 --> 01:06:25.448
I THINK FOR MANY OF US WHO ARE --

01:06:25.514 --> 01:06:26.982
ATTORNEYS OF COLOUR HERE IN THE

01:06:27.049 --> 01:06:28.517
LEGISLATURE WE WERE NOT SUPPOSED

01:06:28.584 --> 01:06:30.720
TO BE HERE EITHER -- AS SOME OF

01:06:30.786 --> 01:06:32.955
IMMIGRANTS -- I WASN'T SUPPOSED

01:06:33.022 --> 01:06:34.156
TO BECOME A LAWYER.

01:06:34.223 --> 01:06:35.524
MY TEACHERS AND SEEN AS A LAWYER

01:06:35.591 --> 01:06:38.160
MY FAMILY CERTAINLY DIDN'T THINK

01:06:38.227 --> 01:06:39.528
THAT ANY OF US.

01:06:39.595 --> 01:06:41.130
WOULD BE IN THE PROFESSIONS THAT

01:06:41.197 --> 01:06:43.766
WE'RE IN NOW AND AND YET WE ARE

01:06:43.833 --> 01:06:46.001
HERE -- AND I THINK FOR MANY OF

01:06:46.068 --> 01:06:46.836
US.

01:06:46.902 --> 01:06:48.904
IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT THAT

01:06:48.971 --> 01:06:50.272
WHILE WE WERE THE LUCKY FEW.

01:06:50.339 --> 01:06:51.474
THAT WE FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE

01:06:51.540 --> 01:06:53.409
SURE THAT OUR LEGAL PROFESSION

01:06:53.476 --> 01:06:55.244
LOOKS AS DIVERSE AS CALIFORNIA

01:06:55.311 --> 01:06:57.947
IS -- APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS

01:06:58.013 --> 01:06:59.949
ABOUT DATA SOMETHING I'VE HAD A

01:07:00.015 --> 01:07:02.051
THE HONOR TO WORK WITH THAT MR

01:07:02.118 --> 01:07:03.586
SUPPORT EQUALITY CALIFORNIA ON

01:07:03.652 --> 01:07:05.221
BUT AS A STATE BARS OWN DATA

01:07:05.287 --> 01:07:06.889
SHOWS AND I THINK THE NEXT PANEL

01:07:06.956 --> 01:07:07.923
IS GOING TO TALK ABOUT.

01:07:07.990 --> 01:07:10.259
THE DATA IS REALLY STARK ABOUT

01:07:10.326 --> 01:07:11.727
HOW MUCH WORK WE HAVE TO DO.

01:07:11.794 --> 01:07:14.063
THE FACT IS -- THE LEGAL

01:07:14.130 --> 01:07:16.532
PROFESSION IS ALMOST 80% WHITE

01:07:16.599 --> 01:07:18.434
WHILE THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC IS

01:07:18.501 --> 01:07:21.771
ONLY 30% 37% WHITE -- THE FACT

01:07:21.837 --> 01:07:23.672
IS THE LEGAL PROFESSION IS

01:07:23.739 --> 01:07:25.074
ALMOST 60% MALE.

01:07:25.141 --> 01:07:27.877
WHICH MEANS ALMOST 50% MORE MEN

01:07:27.943 --> 01:07:29.378
IN THE LEGAL PROFESSION THAN

01:07:29.445 --> 01:07:32.114
WOMAN -- AND YOU CAN LOOK AT

01:07:32.181 --> 01:07:34.550
EVERY INDICATOR OF HOW WE'RE

01:07:34.617 --> 01:07:35.551
DOING WITH REGARD TO DIVERSITY

01:07:35.618 --> 01:07:36.752
WERE NOT DOING WELL I KNOW WE'RE

01:07:36.819 --> 01:07:38.220
GONNA HEAR LATER.

01:07:38.287 --> 01:07:39.488
ABOUT SOME STUDIES SPECIFICALLY

01:07:39.555 --> 01:07:41.223
IN THE API COMMUNITY -- BUT

01:07:41.290 --> 01:07:43.192
DESPITE THE FACT THAT WE HAVE IN

01:07:43.259 --> 01:07:44.960
OUR COMMUNITY SOME NUMBERS AND

01:07:45.027 --> 01:07:46.462
FOR EXAMPLE MAJOR LAW FIRMS.

01:07:46.529 --> 01:07:48.330
API'S HAVE THE HIGHEST ATTRITION

01:07:48.397 --> 01:07:49.598
RATES THE LOWEST RATE OF

01:07:49.665 --> 01:07:52.301
PARTNERSHIPS TO ASSOCIATES --

01:07:52.368 --> 01:07:53.936
VAST MAJORITY IF API ATTORNEYS

01:07:54.003 --> 01:07:56.338
REPORT EXPERIENCING VERY LITTLE

01:07:56.405 --> 01:07:58.174
ACCESS TO MENTORSHIP.

01:07:58.240 --> 01:07:59.275
IMPLICIT BIAS.

01:07:59.341 --> 01:08:01.277
AS WELL AS LOW REPRESENTATION IN

01:08:01.343 --> 01:08:05.381
THE PUBLIC INTEREST IN

01:08:05.448 --> 01:08:05.981
GOVERNMENT SECTOR AND AND THIS

01:08:06.048 --> 01:08:07.216
IS.

01:08:07.283 --> 01:08:07.883
NOT JUST THE STORY THE API

01:08:07.950 --> 01:08:08.918
COMMUNITY IT'S IS THE STORY OF

01:08:08.984 --> 01:08:10.786
OF ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES -- I

01:08:10.853 --> 01:08:11.987
WANT TO JUST OBSERVE ONE THING

01:08:12.054 --> 01:08:13.489
WHICH IS A FEW YEARS AGO WE HAD

01:08:13.556 --> 01:08:15.357
A PRETTY ROBUST CONVERSATION FOR

01:08:15.424 --> 01:08:16.826
SEVERAL YEARS AROUND STATE BAR

01:08:16.892 --> 01:08:18.627
REFORM.

01:08:18.694 --> 01:08:19.195
IN I DON'T THINK IT WAS AN

01:08:19.261 --> 01:08:20.930
ACCIDENT -- THAT ALONG WITH THE

01:08:20.996 --> 01:08:22.498
CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE THAT

01:08:22.565 --> 01:08:24.400
REFORM WAS BEING DRIVEN BY

01:08:24.467 --> 01:08:25.935
REPRESENTATIVES OF THE THREE

01:08:26.001 --> 01:08:27.169
ETHNIC CAUCUSES.

01:08:27.236 --> 01:08:28.537
AND I THINK FOR MANY OF US WE

01:08:28.604 --> 01:08:31.340
HAVE SEEN THE MAJOR INSTITUTIONS

01:08:31.407 --> 01:08:34.477
IN THE STATE -- NOT FOCUSED ON

01:08:34.543 --> 01:08:36.412
THESE ISSUES -- AND AFFECT ALSO

01:08:36.479 --> 01:08:37.980
TO OBSERVE THAT FROM MY

01:08:38.047 --> 01:08:39.982
PERSPECTIVE THE MOST ROBUST

01:08:40.049 --> 01:08:42.952
LEADERSHIP AND WHEN IT COMES. TO

01:08:43.018 --> 01:08:43.486
TWO ATTORNEYS REPRESENTING

01:08:43.552 --> 01:08:46.722
DIVERSITY -- ARE IN BARSA

01:08:46.789 --> 01:08:47.957
STATIONS ARE OUTSIDE OF THE

01:08:48.023 --> 01:08:49.458
STATE BAR AND ETHNIC BAR

01:08:49.525 --> 01:08:51.193
ASSOCIATION AND WOMAN BAR

01:08:51.260 --> 01:08:52.661
ASSOCIATION TEN LGBT BAR SISSY

01:08:52.728 --> 01:08:53.596
ACTIONS.

01:08:53.662 --> 01:08:55.297
IN PART BECAUSE THE MAIN LEGAL

01:08:55.364 --> 01:08:59.368
INSTITUTIONS HAVE NOT FOCUSED ON

01:08:59.435 --> 01:09:01.036
THIS -- THE MAIN.

01:09:01.103 --> 01:09:01.804
INSTITUTIONS IN OUR STATE WHEN

01:09:01.871 --> 01:09:03.372
IT COMES TO THE STATE BAR THE

01:09:03.439 --> 01:09:04.507
THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL HAVE

01:09:04.573 --> 01:09:06.842
HISTORICALLY NOT BEEN VIEWED.

01:09:06.909 --> 01:09:08.677
BY COMMUNITIES OF DIVERSITY AS

01:09:08.744 --> 01:09:09.979
INSTITUTIONS THAT SHOULD BE

01:09:10.045 --> 01:09:12.448
FOCUSED ON THESE ISSUES.

01:09:12.515 --> 01:09:14.183
I WILL SAY IN THE LAST COUPLE OF

01:09:14.250 --> 01:09:15.818
MONTHS IN THE LAST YEAR I HAVE

01:09:15.885 --> 01:09:16.652
NOTED.

01:09:16.719 --> 01:09:18.554
I THINK A CHANGE IN TONE FROM

01:09:18.621 --> 01:09:19.622
THE STATE BAR IN THE DISH

01:09:19.688 --> 01:09:21.290
JUDICIAL COUNCIL ABOUT THE

01:09:21.357 --> 01:09:22.725
WILLINGNESS TO ENGAGE ON THESE

01:09:22.791 --> 01:09:24.827
QUESTIONS AND ISSUES I KNOW WHAT

01:09:24.894 --> 01:09:25.494
YOU'RE FROM THEM LATER.

01:09:25.561 --> 01:09:27.062
BUT FOR I THINK MANY OF US THE

01:09:27.129 --> 01:09:28.564
JURY IS GOING TO BE OUT.

01:09:28.631 --> 01:09:30.599
UNTIL THE DATA CHANGES I THINK

01:09:30.666 --> 01:09:31.700
IT'S EASY TO TALK ABOUT THESE

01:09:31.767 --> 01:09:33.502
ISSUES IT'S EASY TO SAY WE ARE

01:09:33.569 --> 01:09:34.937
COMMITTED TO THESE ISSUES BUT

01:09:35.004 --> 01:09:36.839
IT'S MUCH HARDER TO ACTUALLY

01:09:36.906 --> 01:09:39.174
MOVE THE CHANGE FORD SO -- LET

01:09:39.241 --> 01:09:41.343
ME JUST END MY COMMENTS WITH THE

01:09:41.410 --> 01:09:43.145
QUESTION IF THERE WERE ONE OR

01:09:43.212 --> 01:09:45.314
TWO MAJOR INSTITUTIONAL CHANGES

01:09:45.381 --> 01:09:48.584
THAT YOU COULD MAKE -- WHAT

01:09:48.651 --> 01:09:52.421
WOULD THEY BE WHAT WOULD THEY BE?

01:09:52.488 --> 01:09:54.189
I'M AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR

01:09:54.256 --> 01:09:55.391
QUESTION AND AND THANK YOU FOR

01:09:55.457 --> 01:09:57.993
YOUR COMMENTS.

01:09:58.060 --> 01:09:59.929
I WILL SAY THAT -- THE

01:09:59.995 --> 01:10:02.965
INSTITUTIONAL CHANGES THAT.

01:10:03.032 --> 01:10:04.633
THAT OUR OUR HOPE -- TO BY OUR

01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:05.868
LET THE NEXT COMMUNITY

01:10:05.935 --> 01:10:07.102
PARTICULAR THE CALIFORNIA AT THE

01:10:07.169 --> 01:10:08.704
NO JUDGES ASSOCIATION

01:10:08.771 --> 01:10:09.905
OPPORTUNITY.

01:10:09.972 --> 01:10:10.906
YOU KNOW ONE OF THE REASONS WHY

01:10:10.973 --> 01:10:12.341
TALK ABOUT BEING A GARDENER'S

01:10:12.408 --> 01:10:13.442
DAUGHTER IS BECAUSE I BELIEVE

01:10:13.509 --> 01:10:15.077
THAT IT'S IT'S HARD WORK IT'S

01:10:15.144 --> 01:10:16.645
SUPPORT BUT IT'S OPPORTUNITIES

01:10:16.712 --> 01:10:17.546
ULTIMATELY.

01:10:17.613 --> 01:10:18.948
AND THOSE OPPORTUNITIES MEANS

01:10:19.014 --> 01:10:22.418
THAT WE NEED TO BE -- WE HAVE

01:10:22.484 --> 01:10:23.752
NEED TO HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE.

01:10:23.819 --> 01:10:24.653
AND WE NEED TO BE WELL

01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:26.922
REPRESENTED IN JUDICIAL COUNCIL.

01:10:26.989 --> 01:10:27.823
AB RIGHT WELL REPRESENTED IN

01:10:27.890 --> 01:10:28.824
CEDAR.

01:10:28.891 --> 01:10:29.258
WE NEED TO BE WELL

01:10:29.325 --> 01:10:31.193
REPRESENTATIVE NAH AS PROFESSORS

01:10:31.260 --> 01:10:32.494
IN THE LAW SCHOOLS.

01:10:32.561 --> 01:10:34.330
WHEN YOU BE WELL REPRESENTED --

01:10:34.396 --> 01:10:35.931
HERE IN SACRAMENTO.

01:10:35.998 --> 01:10:38.434
AND SO -- THE INSTITUTIONAL

01:10:38.500 --> 01:10:39.868
CHANGE THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE

01:10:39.935 --> 01:10:40.970
HAPPEN IS.

01:10:41.036 --> 01:10:41.804
NOT ONLY HAVING THAT

01:10:41.870 --> 01:10:43.305
CONVERSATION BUT MAKING CERTAIN

01:10:43.372 --> 01:10:44.506
THAT THOSE OPPORTUNITIES ARE

01:10:44.573 --> 01:10:45.674
MADE TO THE PEOPLE THAT ARE

01:10:45.741 --> 01:10:47.109
QUALIFIED BECAUSE WE DO HAVE

01:10:47.176 --> 01:10:48.611
PEOPLE THAT ARE WELL QUALIFIED

01:10:48.677 --> 01:10:51.313
TO TAKE THOSE POSITIONS

01:10:51.380 --> 01:10:51.614
[inaudible]

01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:53.415
OTHERS.

01:10:53.482 --> 01:10:57.186
I I WOULD LIKE TO ADD THAT AND I

01:10:57.252 --> 01:10:58.387
AM PART OF THE LET US A LAW

01:10:58.454 --> 01:10:59.722
STUDENTS ASSOCIATION AT UC DAVIS

01:10:59.788 --> 01:11:01.924
AND I HAVE BEEN PART OF MANY

01:11:01.991 --> 01:11:02.825
CLASSES.

01:11:02.891 --> 01:11:04.426
STUDENT ASSOCIATIONS -- THROUGH

01:11:04.493 --> 01:11:07.262
UNDERGRAD AS WELL AND I THINK

01:11:07.329 --> 01:11:10.666
ONE OF ONE OF THE REAL LEADERS

01:11:10.733 --> 01:11:12.134
FOR A LOT OF US HAS BEEN THE

01:11:12.201 --> 01:11:13.202
HEALTH THAT.

01:11:13.268 --> 01:11:15.304
I HAD TO TAKE IT TWICE TO BE

01:11:15.371 --> 01:11:17.006
ABLE TO GET INTO LAW SCHOOL

01:11:17.072 --> 01:11:20.576
WHILE WORKING FULL TIME.

01:11:20.643 --> 01:11:21.176
I DIDN'T EVEN GET A CHANCE TO

01:11:21.243 --> 01:11:21.410
FINISH.

01:11:21.477 --> 01:11:23.812
ALL THE SESSIONS BECAUSE I HAD

01:11:23.879 --> 01:11:26.715
TO WORK A JOB IN HALF AND SO.

01:11:26.782 --> 01:11:29.852
I THINK THAT -- THERE NEEDS TO

01:11:29.918 --> 01:11:32.454
BE MORE -- THERE NEEDS TO BE

01:11:32.521 --> 01:11:35.124
CHANGING HOW WE EVALUATE --

01:11:35.190 --> 01:11:37.226
STUDENTS IN TERMS OF LIKE WHAT

01:11:37.292 --> 01:11:38.727
THEY HOW THEY QUALIFIED TO GET

01:11:38.794 --> 01:11:40.596
INTO LAW SCHOOL I THINK THAT ALL

01:11:40.663 --> 01:11:42.031
SIDE IS.

01:11:42.097 --> 01:11:43.799
IS.

01:11:43.866 --> 01:11:45.501
NOT NECESSARILY A GOOD MEASURE

01:11:45.567 --> 01:11:46.969
OF WHETHER YOU WILL SUCCEED IN

01:11:47.036 --> 01:11:49.338
LAW SCHOOL AND I THINK THAT.

01:11:49.405 --> 01:11:50.773
A LOT OF STUDENTS HAVE OTHER

01:11:50.839 --> 01:11:52.374
QUALITIES THAT THEY CAN OFFER

01:11:52.441 --> 01:11:53.676
THAT WILL DIVERSIFY THE LEGAL

01:11:53.742 --> 01:11:55.911
PROFESSION NOT JUST IN TERMS OF

01:11:55.978 --> 01:11:58.514
WHETHER YOU'RE A MINORITY OR NOT --

01:11:58.580 --> 01:12:01.417
BUT I THINK THAT A LOT OF A LOT

01:12:01.483 --> 01:12:03.419
OF UNDER REPRESENTED COMMUNITIES

01:12:03.485 --> 01:12:05.888
BRINK QUALITIES FROM REAL LIFE

01:12:05.954 --> 01:12:08.290
THAT THEY CAN ADD -- TO THEIR

01:12:08.357 --> 01:12:12.161
PRACTICE IN THE LEGAL PROFESSION --

01:12:12.227 --> 01:12:13.729
AND I AGREE WITH JUDGE MESSY AS

01:12:13.796 --> 01:12:15.631
IN TERMS OF OPPORTUNITY I THINK

01:12:15.698 --> 01:12:19.635
THAT -- I HAVE I WAS BLESSED

01:12:19.702 --> 01:12:21.003
WITH A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES

01:12:21.070 --> 01:12:22.705
ALONG THE WAY BUT I ALSO LOOKED

01:12:22.771 --> 01:12:23.806
FOR THEM.

01:12:23.872 --> 01:12:25.808
BECAUSE THEY WERE EASY TO FIND --

01:12:25.874 --> 01:12:28.610
SO OPPORTUNITY RESOURCES IN THE

01:12:28.677 --> 01:12:32.414
AISLES THAT THANK YOU.

01:12:32.481 --> 01:12:33.649
I I'D SAY STATES -- SORT OF TWO

01:12:33.716 --> 01:12:35.050
THINGS ONE IT'S I THINK IT'S

01:12:35.117 --> 01:12:38.120
REALLY PART TO REMOVE BARRIERS.

01:12:38.187 --> 01:12:39.922
TO ENTER THE PRACTICE --

01:12:39.988 --> 01:12:41.123
ECONOMIC VERY SIR BIG ONE FOR

01:12:41.190 --> 01:12:42.791
THE LP HE COMMUNITY AS WELL AS

01:12:42.858 --> 01:12:44.026
MANY OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE

01:12:44.093 --> 01:12:45.194
UNDERREPRESENTED SELLING

01:12:45.260 --> 01:12:47.629
FOCUSING ON WAYS OF INCREASING

01:12:47.696 --> 01:12:49.398
FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE NO MATTER

01:12:49.465 --> 01:12:51.400
WHAT COLLEGE YOU'RE GOING -- TO

01:12:51.467 --> 01:12:53.235
IT'S HOW IT'S ALWAYS HARDER AT

01:12:53.302 --> 01:12:54.703
THE LAW SCHOOL LEVEL AND SO

01:12:54.770 --> 01:12:56.872
THAT'S A BIG BARRIER FOR FOLKS.

01:12:56.939 --> 01:12:59.742
IN OUR COMMUNITY -- I THINK THE

01:12:59.808 --> 01:13:00.909
OTHER THING I WOULD SORT OF SAY

01:13:00.976 --> 01:13:02.277
IS CULTURAL COMES THE TRAINING

01:13:02.344 --> 01:13:03.312
IS IMPORTANT AND IT'S NOT ONLY

01:13:03.378 --> 01:13:04.680
IMPORTANT FROM LGBT Q.

01:13:04.747 --> 01:13:06.081
PERSPECTIVE BUT I THINK IT IS

01:13:06.148 --> 01:13:07.716
THAT THERE SHOULD BE GENERAL

01:13:07.783 --> 01:13:10.119
DIVERSITY TRAINING I MEAN -- THE

01:13:10.185 --> 01:13:11.653
KINDS OF STORIES THAT THE JUDGES

01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:13.589
TALKING ABOUT OF YOU KNOW ABOUT --

01:13:13.655 --> 01:13:15.758
BEING YOU KNOW HEARING MESSAGES

01:13:15.824 --> 01:13:17.826
THAT -- YOU KNOW SHE SHOULDN'T

01:13:17.893 --> 01:13:20.295
BE REACHING FOR SOMETHING SHE

01:13:20.362 --> 01:13:22.831
WANTS TO DO -- I MEAN THOSE ARE

01:13:22.898 --> 01:13:23.699
YOU KNOW.

01:13:23.766 --> 01:13:25.267
NOT USING THE RIGHT LANGUAGE

01:13:25.334 --> 01:13:27.202
REFERRING TO LGBT Q. PEOPLE IN

01:13:27.269 --> 01:13:28.637
WAYS THAT ARE NOT RESPECTFUL

01:13:28.704 --> 01:13:29.671
THAT HAPPENS.

01:13:29.738 --> 01:13:30.973
IN ALL UNDER REPRESENTED

01:13:31.039 --> 01:13:32.674
COMMUNITIES AND SO THAT IS WHY

01:13:32.741 --> 01:13:34.209
WE HAVE BEEN SUCH.

01:13:34.276 --> 01:13:36.612
OF YOU KNOW PUSHING SO MUCH ON

01:13:36.678 --> 01:13:38.881
THE IMPORTANCE OF INCLUDE

01:13:38.947 --> 01:13:40.482
DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION TRAINING

01:13:40.549 --> 01:13:41.984
THAT INCLUDES ALL TO THE LGBTQ

01:13:42.050 --> 01:13:43.152
COMMUNITY BUT REALLY ALL UNDER

01:13:43.218 --> 01:13:44.820
REPRESENTED COMMUNITIES AND IT'S

01:13:44.887 --> 01:13:46.321
IMPORTANT FOR JUDGES.

01:13:46.388 --> 01:13:47.723
I MEAN THAT HAS AN IMPACT ON THE

01:13:47.790 --> 01:13:48.957
ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE IN

01:13:49.024 --> 01:13:49.825
WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE COURT

01:13:49.892 --> 01:13:53.362
ROOM COURT STAFF -- AND EVEN IN

01:13:53.428 --> 01:13:54.296
THE LEGAL PROFESSION AMONG

01:13:54.363 --> 01:13:56.565
LAWYERS HAVE IN THERE IS -- YOU

01:13:56.632 --> 01:13:58.033
KNOW IT'S PART OF THE CONTINUING

01:13:58.100 --> 01:13:59.334
LEGAL EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS

01:13:59.401 --> 01:14:04.039
THERE IS SOME -- REQUIREMENTS ON

01:14:04.106 --> 01:14:05.641
AND ELIMINATION OF BIAS BUT

01:14:05.707 --> 01:14:07.342
GENERALLY THOSE PROGRAMS DOWN

01:14:07.409 --> 01:14:09.645
EXTENDS TO THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY

01:14:09.711 --> 01:14:11.780
AND THAT FRANKLY I THINK --

01:14:11.847 --> 01:14:13.182
THERE WHICH WEEK GENERALLY

01:14:13.248 --> 01:14:15.918
BECAUSE SO MANY OF THESE

01:14:15.984 --> 01:14:17.486
PROGRAMS ARE -- YOU KNOW GIVEN

01:14:17.553 --> 01:14:20.889
FOR BY FOR PROFIT OUTSIDE --

01:14:20.956 --> 01:14:26.261
FOLKS IN THE QUALITY IS IN HIGH

01:14:26.328 --> 01:14:30.165
IN MY OPINION -- TO PAY YOU BACK

01:14:30.232 --> 01:14:30.766
A LITTLE BIT OFF OF PREVIOUS

01:14:30.833 --> 01:14:33.302
COMMENTS -- THE ONE OF THE MOST

01:14:33.368 --> 01:14:35.871
IMPORTANT -- THINGS THE

01:14:35.938 --> 01:14:38.473
INSTITUTIONS CAN DO IS OPEN THE

01:14:38.540 --> 01:14:42.477
DOOR -- FOR THESE COMMUNITIES OF

01:14:42.544 --> 01:14:44.313
I WROTE I WANT TO THANK AGAIN

01:14:44.379 --> 01:14:48.350
THE CHAIR -- AND HIS STAFF HOME

01:14:48.417 --> 01:14:49.751
FOR INCLUDING THE DISABILITY

01:14:49.818 --> 01:14:51.620
COMMUNITY IN THIS CONVERSATION

01:14:51.687 --> 01:14:53.388
BECAUSE SO OFTEN -- IN

01:14:53.455 --> 01:14:55.390
CONVERSATIONS LIKE THESE ONES

01:14:55.457 --> 01:14:57.326
THE DISABILITY COMMUNITIES LEFT

01:14:57.392 --> 01:15:00.495
OUT -- KIND OF FORGOTTEN ABOUT

01:15:00.562 --> 01:15:02.931
YOU KNOW WE THINK OF THE

01:15:02.998 --> 01:15:04.633
DIFFERENT CAUCUSES HERE IN THE

01:15:04.700 --> 01:15:06.802
BUILDING WE THINK OF OF THE

01:15:06.869 --> 01:15:08.503
BLACK CAUCUS OR THE A PR CAUCUS

01:15:08.570 --> 01:15:09.972
OF LATINO CAUCUS.

01:15:10.038 --> 01:15:12.641
BUT OFTEN TIMES OF THE

01:15:12.708 --> 01:15:15.344
DISABILITY -- GROUPS ARE NOT

01:15:15.410 --> 01:15:17.212
NECESSARILY INCLUDED IN AND NOT

01:15:17.279 --> 01:15:19.648
ONLY IS IT IMPORTANT TO HAVE --

01:15:19.715 --> 01:15:21.650
THE DISABILITY COMMUNITY AT MY

01:15:21.717 --> 01:15:23.552
TABLE LIKE THIS ONE BUT ALSO

01:15:23.619 --> 01:15:25.754
HAVING THE DISABILITY COMMUNITY

01:15:25.821 --> 01:15:28.590
INCLUDED AT DECISION MAKING --

01:15:28.657 --> 01:15:32.394
TABLES AS WELL -- TABLES WHERE --

01:15:32.461 --> 01:15:34.396
PEOPLE CAN REALLY REALLY IMPACT

01:15:34.463 --> 01:15:36.164
CHANGE OF IN THE LEGAL

01:15:36.231 --> 01:15:38.467
PROFESSION -- I KNOW HOW

01:15:38.533 --> 01:15:39.768
IMPORTANT.

01:15:39.835 --> 01:15:41.770
IT WAS FOR ME GROWING UP BEING

01:15:41.837 --> 01:15:43.772
ABLE TO LOOK AT AFRICAN AMERICAN

01:15:43.839 --> 01:15:45.674
ATTORNEYS -- AFRICAN AMERICAN

01:15:45.741 --> 01:15:48.310
JUDGES OF AND KNOWING THAT

01:15:48.377 --> 01:15:50.412
BECAUSE THEY CAN DO IT I CAN DO

01:15:50.479 --> 01:15:53.248
IT -- AND UNFORTUNATELY FOR ME

01:15:53.315 --> 01:15:55.083
GROWING UP I DIDN'T SEE.

01:15:55.150 --> 01:15:57.452
VERY MANY OF ATTORNEYS ARE

01:15:57.519 --> 01:15:59.321
JUDGES WITH DISABILITIES -- THAT

01:15:59.388 --> 01:16:00.889
I COULD RELATE TO SO IT'S REALLY

01:16:00.956 --> 01:16:04.459
REALLY IMPORTANT AND AND I KNOW

01:16:04.526 --> 01:16:04.660
THAT.

01:16:04.726 --> 01:16:06.361
HOME. FOR MYSELF IT'S IMPORTANT

01:16:06.428 --> 01:16:08.897
THAT I PAY IT FORWARD AS WELL --

01:16:08.964 --> 01:16:10.766
WHEN I SEE -- KIDS WITH

01:16:10.832 --> 01:16:14.636
DISABILITIES -- WHO ASPIRED TO

01:16:14.703 --> 01:16:16.805
TO BE GREAT -- INSPIRED TO DO

01:16:16.872 --> 01:16:18.907
AMAZING THINGS WHETHER IT'S AS A

01:16:18.974 --> 01:16:20.108
LOBBYIST.

01:16:20.175 --> 01:16:23.612
OR IN THE LEGAL PROFESSION OR

01:16:23.679 --> 01:16:25.280
ANY OTHER PROFESSION THAT IT'S

01:16:25.347 --> 01:16:26.648
IMPORTANT THAT I ENCOURAGE THEM

01:16:26.715 --> 01:16:31.553
AND I SHOW THEM THAT THAT THEY

01:16:31.620 --> 01:16:32.187
CAN BE EXACTLY WHO THEY WANT TO

01:16:32.254 --> 01:16:33.288
BE.

01:16:33.355 --> 01:16:33.989
VERY MUCH APPRECIATE ALL THE

01:16:34.056 --> 01:16:35.524
COMMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE AND

01:16:35.590 --> 01:16:36.792
I WANT TO JUST REFLECT ON THEM

01:16:36.858 --> 01:16:39.161
FOR A MOMENT BUT TO SAY.

01:16:39.227 --> 01:16:41.229
AN APOLOGY TO THE CHAIR WE ONLY

01:16:41.296 --> 01:16:43.432
HAVE TWO MORE DAYS -- BEFORE WE

01:16:43.498 --> 01:16:44.900
HAVE TO START VOTING ON HUNDREDS

01:16:44.967 --> 01:16:47.202
OF BILLS NEXT WEEK AND I KNOW --

01:16:47.269 --> 01:16:48.470
THAT EVERYONE'S TRYING

01:16:48.537 --> 01:16:49.738
FRANTICALLY DO LAST MINUTE

01:16:49.805 --> 01:16:51.406
MEETINGS -- BUT I WILL SHARE

01:16:51.473 --> 01:16:53.342
THAT THIS VERY CONVERSATION IS

01:16:53.408 --> 01:16:55.177
ONE I'VE HAD OFTEN NOT JUST WITH

01:16:55.243 --> 01:16:56.812
LEGAL.

01:16:56.878 --> 01:17:01.116
LEADERS AROUND -- SO REST

01:17:01.183 --> 01:17:03.185
ASSURED WE ARE TO BE FOCUSED ON

01:17:03.251 --> 01:17:05.020
THIS TOPIC REGARDLESS OF WHETHER

01:17:05.087 --> 01:17:06.021
WE ARE PHYSICALLY HERE NOT.

01:17:06.088 --> 01:17:08.190
ON A FEW THINGS I'M HOPING THE

01:17:08.256 --> 01:17:08.824
REST OF THIS HEARINGS GOING TO

01:17:08.890 --> 01:17:10.926
COVER -- ONE THAT THE TOPIC

01:17:10.993 --> 01:17:12.995
AROUND TESTS AND THE L. SAID IN

01:17:13.061 --> 01:17:15.297
A PARTICULAR THIS THE BAR EXAM.

01:17:15.364 --> 01:17:17.566
UP THE DATA IS VERY VERY CLEAR

01:17:17.632 --> 01:17:21.436
AND HOW THESE EXAMS SEEM TO BE

01:17:21.503 --> 01:17:23.839
BORING -- FUTURE LEADERS WITHIN

01:17:23.905 --> 01:17:25.007
THE LEGAL PROFESSION.

01:17:25.073 --> 01:17:26.708
THAT REPRESENT THE DIVERSITY OF

01:17:26.775 --> 01:17:30.278
OUR STATE AND IT IT'S IT'S IT'S

01:17:30.345 --> 01:17:31.279
A CONVERSATION I THINK WE

01:17:31.346 --> 01:17:32.748
ABSOLUTELY NEED TO HAVE ITS ONE

01:17:32.814 --> 01:17:34.549
WERE ALL VERY CONCERNED ABOUT --

01:17:34.616 --> 01:17:36.018
I THINK THEY'RE MANY REASONS ON

01:17:36.084 --> 01:17:37.419
BOTH SIDES OF Y. THING SHOULD OR

01:17:37.486 --> 01:17:39.121
SHOULD NOT CHANGE BUT FROM MY

01:17:39.187 --> 01:17:39.755
PERSPECTIVE I THINK THE BURDEN

01:17:39.821 --> 01:17:41.790
OF PROOF SHOULD LIE WITH THE

01:17:41.857 --> 01:17:43.392
STATUS QUO BECAUSE THINGS HAVE

01:17:43.458 --> 01:17:44.626
TO CHANGE.

01:17:44.693 --> 01:17:46.328
THE SECOND SET OF QUESTIONS I

01:17:46.395 --> 01:17:47.596
REALLY DO HOPE ARE ANSWERED IN

01:17:47.662 --> 01:17:49.164
ON SOME OF THE PANELISTS ALLUDED

01:17:49.231 --> 01:17:50.265
TO THIS IS JUST.

01:17:50.332 --> 01:17:52.000
AGAIN HOW DO WE PUSH THE LEGAL

01:17:52.067 --> 01:17:53.902
PROFESSION IN EVERY PART OF THE

01:17:53.969 --> 01:17:55.537
PROFESSION TO GET MORE DIVERSE

01:17:55.604 --> 01:17:57.606
NOT JUST BROADLY RIGHT YOU CAN

01:17:57.672 --> 01:17:59.074
LOOK AT DATA ACROSS THE SPECTRUM.

01:17:59.141 --> 01:18:00.342
BUT WHAT CAN BE DONE

01:18:00.409 --> 01:18:01.610
SPECIFICALLY.

01:18:01.676 --> 01:18:02.811
WITHIN THE PRIVATE BAR AND LAW

01:18:02.878 --> 01:18:04.446
FIRMS TO MOVE THINGS FOR WHAT

01:18:04.513 --> 01:18:06.048
CAN BE DONE IN ACADEMIA WHAT CAN

01:18:06.114 --> 01:18:07.682
BE DONE AND GOVERNMENT.

01:18:07.749 --> 01:18:08.550
WHAT CAN BE DONE IN THE PUBLIC

01:18:08.617 --> 01:18:09.918
INTEREST NONPROFIT SECTOR MY

01:18:09.985 --> 01:18:11.086
HOPE IS THERE WILL BE SUBSEQUENT

01:18:11.153 --> 01:18:13.889
PANELS THAT DIVE SPECIFICALLY

01:18:13.955 --> 01:18:15.624
INTO INTO THOSE QUESTIONS --

01:18:15.690 --> 01:18:17.492
BLESSING WANT TO SAY IS THE GOOD

01:18:17.559 --> 01:18:19.127
JUDGE REFER TO OPPORTUNITIES AND

01:18:19.194 --> 01:18:20.629
HOW WE MAKE SURE THAT FOLKS ARE

01:18:20.695 --> 01:18:23.065
AT THE TABLE AND WHAT I HAVE.

01:18:23.131 --> 01:18:25.267
MY MY CONCERN ABOUT THE MAJOR

01:18:25.333 --> 01:18:26.601
LEGAL INSTITUTIONS IN MOVEMENT

01:18:26.668 --> 01:18:30.939
FOR REFORM IS WE HAVEN'T SEEN.

01:18:31.006 --> 01:18:31.239
CHANGE YET.

01:18:31.306 --> 01:18:32.307
AND THESE ARE INSTITUTIONS THAT

01:18:32.374 --> 01:18:33.809
HAVE NOT BEEN AS DIVERSE AS WE

01:18:33.875 --> 01:18:35.343
NEED THEM TO BE THEMSELVES AND

01:18:35.410 --> 01:18:36.878
SO WHEN IT SUGGESTED FOR EXAMPLE

01:18:36.945 --> 01:18:38.480
THAT THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL CAN

01:18:38.547 --> 01:18:39.781
LEAD ON THIS.

01:18:39.848 --> 01:18:41.516
THAT IS GREAT NEWS BUT WE'RE

01:18:41.583 --> 01:18:44.586
TALKING ABOUT -- A BENCH THAT IS

01:18:44.653 --> 01:18:46.455
BY AND LARGE STILL DOMINATED BY

01:18:46.521 --> 01:18:47.656
FOLKS THAT DON'T REFLECT THE

01:18:47.722 --> 01:18:48.990
DIVERSITY OF OUR STATE AND SO MY

01:18:49.057 --> 01:18:50.826
QUESTION TO THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL

01:18:50.892 --> 01:18:51.426
WOULD BE.

01:18:51.493 --> 01:18:53.829
HOW ARE THEY GOING TO BE ABLE TO

01:18:53.895 --> 01:18:56.398
MOVE THINGS FORWARD -- GIVEN THE

01:18:56.465 --> 01:18:57.532
LACK OF DIVERSITY THAT THE

01:18:57.599 --> 01:18:59.601
INSTITUTIONAL FLEX -- TO THE

01:18:59.668 --> 01:19:00.902
STATE BAR I'LL JUST NOTE --

01:19:00.969 --> 01:19:02.337
THERE HAVE BEEN SOME HEADWAY

01:19:02.404 --> 01:19:03.905
THIS YEAR AFTER BAR REFORMS WERE

01:19:03.972 --> 01:19:06.108
PUT INTO PLACE BY A STATE BAR

01:19:06.174 --> 01:19:07.509
PRESIDENT WHO REFLECTS THE

01:19:07.576 --> 01:19:08.944
DIVERSITY OF OUR STATE WHO

01:19:09.010 --> 01:19:10.278
HAPPENS.

01:19:10.345 --> 01:19:11.913
TO HAVE COME THROUGH SOME OF THE

01:19:11.980 --> 01:19:14.516
ETHNIC BARS THAT I WAS REFERRING --

01:19:14.583 --> 01:19:15.450
TO AND YOU HAPPEN HAVE BEEN

01:19:15.517 --> 01:19:16.985
APPOINTED TO HIS POSITION.

01:19:17.052 --> 01:19:18.286
AFTER THE STATE BAR FORMS THAT

01:19:18.353 --> 01:19:19.955
WE PUT IN PLACE AND I'M

01:19:20.021 --> 01:19:21.823
CONCERNED THAT AFTER HE LEAVES --

01:19:21.890 --> 01:19:23.325
I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHAT

01:19:23.391 --> 01:19:24.759
CONTINUITIES GOING TO EXIST

01:19:24.826 --> 01:19:25.627
WITHIN THE STATE PARTY WITH THE

01:19:25.694 --> 01:19:27.395
SPORTS SO MY HOPE IS TO COME

01:19:27.462 --> 01:19:28.497
BACK TO ASK THESE QUESTIONS

01:19:28.563 --> 01:19:30.365
DIRECTLY IN FUTURE PANELS BUT IF

01:19:30.432 --> 01:19:32.267
I'M NOT ABLE TO GET BACK -- I DO

01:19:32.334 --> 01:19:33.702
HOPE MY STAFF WILL BE HERE WILL

01:19:33.768 --> 01:19:35.971
BE MONITORING AND WILL CONTINUE

01:19:36.037 --> 01:19:36.705

01:23:36.544 --> 01:23:37.145
IN ACCESSING THE LEGAL

01:23:37.212 --> 01:23:38.513
PROFESSION -- IT'S SORT OF

01:23:38.580 --> 01:23:40.248
USEFUL TO FRAME THE REST OF OUR

01:23:40.315 --> 01:23:41.282
DISCUSSION TODAY.

01:23:41.349 --> 01:23:42.951
WITH SOME OF THAT THE STATISTICS

01:23:43.017 --> 01:23:44.519
IDENTIFYING JUST EXACTLY WHAT

01:23:49.324 --> 01:23:51.526
A WHOLE -- I WANNA GIVE A BIT OF

01:23:51.593 --> 01:23:53.828
A DISCLAIMER HERE THAT -- IN THE

01:23:53.895 --> 01:23:54.896
INTEREST OF TIME I'M GOING TO

01:23:54.963 --> 01:23:55.930
FOCUS PRIMARILY ON RACIAL

01:23:55.997 --> 01:23:57.832
DIVERSITY -- BUT THAT THIS IS

01:23:57.899 --> 01:23:59.100
NOT.

01:23:59.167 --> 01:24:00.869
TO DISCOUNT THE IMPORTANCE OF

01:24:00.935 --> 01:24:02.637
FOR EXAMPLE LGBT Q. ADD

01:24:02.704 --> 01:24:04.372
DIVERSITY TRANS GENDER DIVERSITY

01:24:04.439 --> 01:24:07.375
DISABILITY PER DIVERSITY AND THE

01:24:07.442 --> 01:24:08.810
LIKE -- WE DO HAVE SOME

01:24:08.877 --> 01:24:09.344
STATISTICS ON THAT IN THE

01:24:09.411 --> 01:24:09.878
BACKGROUND PAPER FOR THIS

01:24:09.944 --> 01:24:10.845
INFORMATIONAL HEARING IF YOU'RE

INTERESTED AND I'M ALSO HAPPY TO

01:24:12.580 --> 01:24:13.548

01:24:13.615 --> 01:24:15.784
QUESTIONING PERIOD.

01:24:15.850 --> 01:24:16.718
SO.

01:24:16.785 --> 01:24:17.652
THE LEGAL PROFESSION IS AMONG

01:24:17.719 --> 01:24:19.254
THE LEAST DIVERSE PROFESSIONS IN

01:24:19.320 --> 01:24:21.689
THE NATION -- AND IF YOU LOOK UP

01:24:21.756 --> 01:24:23.258
HERE YOU CAN SEE THAT -- WITH

01:24:23.324 --> 01:24:25.126
SEVERAL OTHER PROFESSIONS THAT

01:24:25.193 --> 01:24:26.661
REQUIRE SIMILAR AMOUNTS OF

01:24:26.728 --> 01:24:28.163
TRAINING AND PROFICIENCY AT

01:24:28.229 --> 01:24:29.531
LEGAL PROFESSION NONETHELESS

01:24:29.597 --> 01:24:31.499
FALLS SHORT IN TERMS OF

01:24:31.566 --> 01:24:32.100
REPRESENTATION OF PEOPLE OF

01:24:32.167 --> 01:24:34.436
COLOR -- SO ABOUT BETWEEN A

01:24:34.502 --> 01:24:35.370
QUARTER AND A THIRD OF

01:24:35.437 --> 01:24:36.604
PHYSICIANS FOR EXAMPLE ARE

01:24:36.671 --> 01:24:38.840
PEOPLE OF COLOR AND YET ONLY 12%

01:24:38.907 --> 01:24:40.542
OF LAWYERS NATIONALLY ARE

01:24:40.608 --> 01:24:42.343
COMPRISED OF PEOPLE OF COLOR --

01:24:42.410 --> 01:24:43.478
WHAT CALIFORNIA'S LAWYERS ARE

01:24:43.545 --> 01:24:44.913
MARGINALLY MORE DIVERSE THAN THE

01:24:44.979 --> 01:24:46.514
NATION'S AS A WHOLE WITH 80%

01:24:46.581 --> 01:24:48.383
BEING WHITE VERSUS 88%

01:24:48.450 --> 01:24:50.151
NATIONWIDE -- WHEN YOU CONSIDER

01:24:50.218 --> 01:24:51.419
THIS IN THE CONTEXT OF

01:24:51.486 --> 01:24:52.454
CALIFORNIA'S UNIQUELY DIVERSE

01:24:52.520 --> 01:24:55.156
DEMOGRAPHICS WITH ONLY 37% BEING

01:24:55.223 --> 01:24:57.826
WHITE COMPARED 273% IN THE

01:24:57.892 --> 01:24:59.194
NATION AS A WHOLE -- IT'S VERY

01:24:59.260 --> 01:25:00.728
CLEAR THAT MINORITY UNDER

01:25:00.795 --> 01:25:01.930
REPRESENTATION IN CALIFORNIA

01:25:01.996 --> 01:25:02.997
ATTORNEYS IS PARTICULARLY

01:25:03.064 --> 01:25:05.433
PROBLEMATIC -- AND THIS IS TRUE

01:25:05.500 --> 01:25:08.069
IN SPITE OF SEVERAL EFFORTS BY

01:25:08.136 --> 01:25:09.704
THE LEGISLATURE BY THE FORMER

01:25:09.771 --> 01:25:11.706
GOVERNOR AND VARIOUS NON PROFITS

01:25:11.773 --> 01:25:13.274
AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS. TO

01:25:13.341 --> 01:25:16.377
ATTEMPT TO INCREASE DIVERSITY

01:25:16.444 --> 01:25:18.780
WITHIN THE LEGAL PROFESSION --

01:25:18.847 --> 01:25:20.215
IT IS TRUE THAT.

01:25:20.281 --> 01:25:21.950
SINCE TWO THOUSAND ONE THERE

01:25:22.016 --> 01:25:23.818
HAVE BEEN MARGINAL INCREASES IN

01:25:23.885 --> 01:25:24.819
ATTORNEYS OF COLOUR AT YOU CAN

01:25:24.886 --> 01:25:26.521
SEE THERE ARE QUITE SMALL HERE

01:25:26.588 --> 01:25:29.157
BUT NONE THE LESS AT THAT TREND

01:25:29.224 --> 01:25:29.657
IS MOVING IN THE CORRECT

01:25:29.724 --> 01:25:31.292
DIRECTION -- BUT THIS

01:25:31.359 --> 01:25:32.961
IMPROVEMENT AT BEST ONLY KEEPS

01:25:33.027 --> 01:25:34.529
PACE WITH THE DEMOGRAPHIC THE

01:25:34.596 --> 01:25:35.597
DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGES IN THE STATE

01:25:35.663 --> 01:25:37.465
OF CALIFORNIA AND IN FACT IF YOU

01:25:37.532 --> 01:25:38.867
LOOK AT THESE CHANGES OVER TIME

01:25:38.933 --> 01:25:40.168
WHEN CONSIDERED RELATIVE TO THE

01:25:40.235 --> 01:25:41.803
PERCENTAGE OF THE POPULATION.

01:25:41.870 --> 01:25:43.271
WE CAN ACTUALLY SEE AN INCREASE

01:25:43.338 --> 01:25:44.606
SINCE TWO THOUSAND ONE IN THE

01:25:44.672 --> 01:25:46.374
OVER REPRESENTATION OF WHITE

01:25:46.441 --> 01:25:47.475
INDIVIDUALS IN THE LEGAL

01:25:47.542 --> 01:25:49.677
PROFESSION AND IF YOU LOOK AT

01:25:49.744 --> 01:25:51.079
FURTHER DOWN HERE.

01:25:51.145 --> 01:25:53.481
AT WE CAN SEE HOW THIS WORKS AND

01:25:53.548 --> 01:25:54.782
WE CAN SEE THAT THERE IS

01:25:54.849 --> 01:25:57.051
ACTUALLY A RELATIVELY FLAT LINE

01:25:57.118 --> 01:25:59.621
FROM 200-012-2017 IN TERMS OF

01:25:59.687 --> 01:26:01.122
THE REPRESENTATION AS A

01:26:01.189 --> 01:26:03.858
PROPORTION OF THE POPULATION FOR

01:26:03.925 --> 01:26:05.226
PEOPLE OF COLOR -- THERE ARE

01:26:05.293 --> 01:26:06.294
SEVERAL REASONS THAT MIGHT BE

01:26:06.361 --> 01:26:08.563
THE CASE AND HOPEFULLY THE REST

01:26:08.630 --> 01:26:10.031
OF THE PANELS TODAY WE'LL

01:26:10.098 --> 01:26:11.466
DISCUSS THESE IN MORE DETAIL --

01:26:11.533 --> 01:26:12.267
BUT I JUST WANTED TO COMMENT

01:26:12.333 --> 01:26:14.335
VERY BRIEFLY ON ONE OF THESE

01:26:14.402 --> 01:26:16.070
POSSIBLE BOTTLENECKS IN TERMS OF

01:26:16.137 --> 01:26:17.005
DIVERSITY.

01:26:17.071 --> 01:26:18.540
IN THE LEGAL PROFESSION AND

01:26:18.606 --> 01:26:19.974
THAT'S RACIAL DISPARITIES IN BAR

01:26:20.041 --> 01:26:23.111
EXAM PARTICIPATION AND PASSAGE

01:26:23.177 --> 01:26:23.311
RATES.

01:26:23.378 --> 01:26:23.678
I'M [inaudible]

01:26:23.745 --> 01:26:24.445
SO.

01:26:24.512 --> 01:26:25.980
I'M JUST HIGHLIGHTING A SINGLE

01:26:26.047 --> 01:26:26.814
ONE OF THESE ISSUES BUT IT'S

01:26:26.881 --> 01:26:28.216
VERY CLEAR HERE WHEN YOU LOOK AT

01:26:28.283 --> 01:26:29.317
THIS FIRST CHART.

01:26:29.384 --> 01:26:30.184
THAT THE PERCENTAGE OF

01:26:30.251 --> 01:26:32.120
CALIFORNIA BAR EXAM TEST TAKERS

01:26:32.186 --> 01:26:34.055
AT AS A FUNCTION OF THE

01:26:34.122 --> 01:26:35.623
PERCENTAGE OF THE POPULATION IS

01:26:35.690 --> 01:26:37.825
ALREADY QUITE UNEQUAL ACROSS

01:26:37.892 --> 01:26:39.394
DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS SO YOU CAN

01:26:39.460 --> 01:26:41.429
SEE THAT Y. AN API INDIVIDUALS

01:26:41.496 --> 01:26:41.896
ARE.

01:26:41.963 --> 01:26:43.331
FAIRLY WELL REPRESENTED IN TERMS

01:26:43.398 --> 01:26:45.166
OF CALIFORNIA BAR EXAM TEST

01:26:45.233 --> 01:26:46.067
TAKERS.

01:26:46.134 --> 01:26:47.335
BLACK INDIVIDUALS ARE ABOUT EVEN

01:26:47.402 --> 01:26:49.771
WITH THE POPULATION AND HISPANIC

01:26:49.837 --> 01:26:50.705
INDIVIDUALS.

01:26:50.772 --> 01:26:52.540
AS WE SEE IN BASED ON SOME OF

01:26:52.607 --> 01:26:53.408
THE HURDLES THAT THEY FACE

01:26:53.474 --> 01:26:55.443
PERSONALLY -- SEEM TO FALL QUITE

01:26:55.510 --> 01:26:56.978
SHORT IN TERMS OF REPRESENTATION

01:26:57.045 --> 01:26:58.112
HERE.

01:26:58.179 --> 01:26:59.213
AT BUT THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT

01:26:59.280 --> 01:27:01.249
ACT XIN ISN'T NECESSARY ON THE

01:27:01.316 --> 01:27:02.850
BAR EXAM AS A WHOLE IN ORDER TO

01:27:02.917 --> 01:27:04.686
ADDRESS ISSUES ACROSS VARIOUS

01:27:04.752 --> 01:27:06.554
RACES -- SO IF WE LOOK AT THE

01:27:06.621 --> 01:27:08.256
BAR EXAM PASSAGE RIGHT ACROSS

01:27:08.323 --> 01:27:09.958
DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS AT WE CAN SEE

01:27:10.024 --> 01:27:11.292
THAT ABOUT 60% OF WHITE

01:27:11.359 --> 01:27:12.827
INDIVIDUALS IN THE TWENTY

01:27:12.894 --> 01:27:13.728
EIGHTEEN BAR EXAM.

01:27:13.795 --> 01:27:15.096
AT PASSED IN THIS IS COMPARED TO

01:27:15.163 --> 01:27:17.465
ABOUT 32% OF BLACK INDIVIDUALS

01:27:17.532 --> 01:27:19.033
AND IN THE UPPER FORTIES FOR A.

01:27:19.100 --> 01:27:21.903
B. I. R. HISPANIC INDIVIDUALS --

01:27:21.970 --> 01:27:23.538
AND JUST DEMONSTRATING THAT THE

01:27:23.605 --> 01:27:25.873
HISPANIC DEMOGRAPHIC SEEMS.

01:27:25.940 --> 01:27:27.041
THERE'S BEEN A DEMOGRAPHIC SEATS

01:27:27.108 --> 01:27:29.544
TO SUFFER -- PREDOMINATELY FROM

01:27:29.611 --> 01:27:31.579
A LACK OF PARTICIPATION AND WE

01:27:31.646 --> 01:27:32.647
CAN SEE THAT A MULTI FACETED

01:27:32.714 --> 01:27:34.515
APPROACH IS NECESSARY IN ORDER

01:27:34.582 --> 01:27:36.884
TO ENCOMPASS -- SORT OF ALL OF

01:27:36.951 --> 01:27:38.286
THESE DIVERSE GROUPS IN TERMS OF

01:27:38.353 --> 01:27:39.487
INCREASING REPRESENTATION IN THE

01:27:39.554 --> 01:27:41.723
JUDICIAL PROFESSION -- AND THAT

01:27:41.789 --> 01:27:43.257
CONSIDERING DIVERSITY SORT OF

01:27:43.324 --> 01:27:45.259
MONOLITHIC LEE IS NOT

01:27:45.326 --> 01:27:47.862
NECESSARILY THE CORRECT APPROACH.

01:27:47.929 --> 01:27:49.063
IT IS ALSO THE CASE THAT WESEE

01:27:49.130 --> 01:27:50.198
SOME BOTTLENECKS IN TERMS OF

01:27:50.264 --> 01:27:51.566
CAREER ADVANCEMENT AMONG WOMEN

01:27:51.633 --> 01:27:53.067
AND PEOPLE OF COLOR AND THE

01:27:53.134 --> 01:27:54.902
LEGAL PROFESSION -- SO WE CAN

01:27:54.969 --> 01:27:56.004
SEE THAT WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT

01:27:56.070 --> 01:27:57.038
THE PERCENTAGE OF ASSOCIATES

01:27:57.105 --> 01:27:59.607
WALLETS REMAINED RELATIVELY FLAT

01:27:59.674 --> 01:28:01.342
ACROSS AT THE PAST.

01:28:01.409 --> 01:28:02.810
DECADE OR SO.

01:28:02.877 --> 01:28:04.045
WE CAN NONETHELESS SEE THAT

01:28:04.112 --> 01:28:05.647
WHITE MEN COMPRISE A SUBSTANTIAL

01:28:05.713 --> 01:28:07.048
PORTION OF THE POPULATION OF

01:28:07.115 --> 01:28:08.683
ASSOCIATES IN THE FIRST PLACE AT

01:28:08.750 --> 01:28:09.917
REFLECTING SORT OF THE LACK OF

01:28:09.984 --> 01:28:11.352
DIVERSITY IN THE GYM AND THE

01:28:11.419 --> 01:28:12.020
LEGISLATIVE.

01:28:12.086 --> 01:28:13.388
ART I'M SORRY IN THE LEGAL

01:28:13.454 --> 01:28:15.089
PROFESSION AS A WHOLE -- BUT

01:28:15.156 --> 01:28:16.124
WHEN WE LOOK AT THE PERCENTAGE

01:28:16.190 --> 01:28:18.393
OF PARTNERS IS DRAMATICALLY

01:28:18.459 --> 01:28:19.994
DOMINATED BY WHITE MEN AND WE

01:28:20.061 --> 01:28:20.995
CAN SEE THAT THERE'S A SOMEWHAT

01:28:21.062 --> 01:28:22.730
NEGLIGIBLE PERCENTAGE OF

01:28:22.797 --> 01:28:25.166
PARTNERS THAT THESE LAW FIRMS.

01:28:25.233 --> 01:28:28.469
AT AT THE AT THE BOTTOM HERE AB

01:28:28.536 --> 01:28:30.104
THAT HAS CHANGED VERY LITTLE

01:28:30.171 --> 01:28:32.473
OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS -- IT'S

01:28:32.540 --> 01:28:33.708
TEMPTING TO ATTRIBUTE THE DEARTH

01:28:33.775 --> 01:28:35.143
OF MINORITY PARTNERS TO A LACK

01:28:35.209 --> 01:28:35.977
AN IMPENDING DIVERSITY

01:28:36.044 --> 01:28:37.879
IMPROVEMENTS THAT WE'VE MADE

01:28:37.945 --> 01:28:39.580
SOME DIVERSITY IMPROVEMENTS THAT.

01:28:39.647 --> 01:28:41.249
HAVE NOT YET TAKEN EFFECT AS

01:28:41.315 --> 01:28:42.984
PEOPLE CRITICS APPEARANCE AT BUT

01:28:43.051 --> 01:28:44.152
THIS EXPLANATION DOESN'T SEEM TO

01:28:44.218 --> 01:28:45.620
BE REFLECTED BY THESE DATA AS

01:28:45.687 --> 01:28:47.121
YOU CAN SEE THERE'S VERY LITTLE

01:28:47.188 --> 01:28:49.157
INCREASE -- IN THESE VARIOUS

01:28:49.223 --> 01:28:50.391
RACIAL AND ETHNIC GROUPS FOR

01:28:50.458 --> 01:28:51.959
OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS AND THIS

01:28:52.026 --> 01:28:53.494
IS IN CONTRAST TO WOMEN WHICH

01:28:53.561 --> 01:28:54.896
HAVE AT LEAST THAT VERY.

01:28:54.962 --> 01:28:56.898
MARGINAL BUT GRADUAL INCREASE

01:28:56.964 --> 01:28:58.766
HERE THAT MAY REFLECT SOME

01:28:58.833 --> 01:29:01.769
DIVERSITY EFFORTS -- THAT'S NOT

01:29:01.836 --> 01:29:02.904
TO SAY THAT WOMEN IN THE LEGAL

01:29:02.970 --> 01:29:03.905
PROFESSION ARE BEING WELL

01:29:03.971 --> 01:29:05.039
REPRESENTED IN TERMS OF THE

01:29:05.106 --> 01:29:06.941
PERCENTAGE OF PARTNERS -- SO

01:29:07.008 --> 01:29:09.010
THAT VERY GRADUAL INCREASE IN

01:29:09.077 --> 01:29:10.712
THE PERCENTAGE OF OF WOMEN

01:29:10.778 --> 01:29:11.713
PARTNERS IS NONETHELESS IN THE

01:29:11.779 --> 01:29:13.147
CONTEXT OF A MUCH MORE DRAMATIC

01:29:13.214 --> 01:29:14.282
INCREASE IN THE PERCENTAGE OF

01:29:14.348 --> 01:29:15.383
ATTORNEYS WHO ARE WOMEN IN THE

01:29:15.450 --> 01:29:17.218
LEGAL PROFESSION -- AND YOU CAN

01:29:17.285 --> 01:29:18.720
SEE A SORT OF COALESCING AND

01:29:18.786 --> 01:29:20.822
GENDER IDENTITY -- OF OF

01:29:20.888 --> 01:29:22.890
CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY SINCE

01:29:22.957 --> 01:29:23.491
NINETEEN NINETY ONE WHILE IT

01:29:23.558 --> 01:29:24.492
STILL DOESN'T QUITE REFLECT THE

01:29:24.559 --> 01:29:26.828
POPULATION AND IT'S AT LEAST

01:29:26.894 --> 01:29:27.328
TRAINING IN THE CORRECT

01:29:27.395 --> 01:29:28.763
DIRECTION -- BUT THIS

01:29:28.830 --> 01:29:30.364
NONETHELESS UNDERSCORE SOME OF

01:29:30.431 --> 01:29:32.066
THE OBSTACLES THAT AT WOMEN

01:29:32.133 --> 01:29:33.501
ACTUALLY FACE IN TERMS OF CAREER

01:29:33.568 --> 01:29:35.837
ADVANCEMENT -- AND THESE

01:29:35.903 --> 01:29:36.671
LIMITATIONS AND CAREER

01:29:36.738 --> 01:29:39.140
ADVANCEMENT ARE OFTEN ATTRIBUTED

01:29:39.207 --> 01:29:40.007
TO THE POSSIBILITY THAT WOMEN

01:29:40.074 --> 01:29:41.709
TAKE MATERNAL LEAVE AND

01:29:41.776 --> 01:29:42.343
THEREFORE TAKE TIME OUT OF THE

01:29:42.410 --> 01:29:43.377
LABOR FORCE.

01:29:43.444 --> 01:29:44.245
AT WHICH DOLLARS THEIR CAREER

01:29:44.312 --> 01:29:45.580
ADVANCEMENT BUT THE DAY DON'T

01:29:45.646 --> 01:29:47.281
SEEM TO SUPPORT THAT SO EVEN

01:29:47.348 --> 01:29:48.716
AMONG WOMEN WHO WORK SIMILAR

01:29:48.783 --> 01:29:50.618
HOURS AND DON'T TAKE TIME OUT OF

01:29:50.685 --> 01:29:51.686
THE LABOR FORCE TO HAVE CHILDREN.

01:29:51.753 --> 01:29:53.688
AB THEY'RE STILL ABOUT 40% LESS

01:29:53.755 --> 01:29:55.389
LIKELY THAN SIMILARLY SITUATED

01:29:55.456 --> 01:29:58.326
MAN TO FIND THEIR WAY INTO THE

01:29:58.392 --> 01:29:59.827
POSITION OF A PARTNER.

01:29:59.894 --> 01:30:00.828
AND THOSE LIMITATIONS AND LEGAL

01:30:00.895 --> 01:30:02.230
CAREER ADVANCEMENT AMONG PEOPLE

01:30:02.296 --> 01:30:03.865
OF COLOR AREN'T LIMITED TO

01:30:03.931 --> 01:30:05.099
PRIVATE LAW FIRMS AND REACHING

01:30:05.166 --> 01:30:07.535
PARTNER BUT ALSO SEEM TO EXTEND

01:30:07.602 --> 01:30:09.504
TO THE BENCH -- THE BROWN

01:30:09.570 --> 01:30:10.938
ADMINISTRATION MADE DIVERSIFYING

01:30:11.005 --> 01:30:12.473
THE JUDICIARY A PRIORITY AND

01:30:12.540 --> 01:30:14.375
INDEED DID INCREASE DIVERSITY IN

01:30:14.442 --> 01:30:15.676
JUDICIAL REPRESENTATION AND YOU

01:30:15.743 --> 01:30:16.978
CAN ACTUALLY SEE A LITTLE BIT

01:30:17.044 --> 01:30:18.813
HERE THERE'S SOME UP TICK AT THE

01:30:18.880 --> 01:30:20.248
COMBINATION OF THAT

01:30:20.314 --> 01:30:22.183
ADMINISTRATION AT THE END -- BUT

01:30:22.250 --> 01:30:24.685
THESE HAVE LARGELY OVER THE PAST

01:30:24.752 --> 01:30:26.220
DECADE AND A HALF.

01:30:26.287 --> 01:30:27.955
KEPT PACE WITH BUT NOT EXCEEDED

01:30:28.022 --> 01:30:29.457
THE DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGE IN

01:30:29.524 --> 01:30:32.293
CALIFORNIA -- AS OF TWENTY

01:30:32.360 --> 01:30:32.760
NINETEEN TWENTY ONE OF

01:30:32.827 --> 01:30:33.995
CALIFORNIA'S FIFTY EIGHT COUNTY

01:30:34.061 --> 01:30:35.897
COURTS ARE EXCLUSIVELY WHITE.

01:30:35.963 --> 01:30:37.365
TWELVE EXCLUSIVELY MALE AND TEN

01:30:37.431 --> 01:30:38.699
CONSIST EXCLUSIVELY OF WHITE

01:30:38.766 --> 01:30:41.536
HETEROSEXUAL ABLE BODIED MALES --

01:30:41.602 --> 01:30:43.404
SO CLEARLY THERE'S STILL A LONG

01:30:43.471 --> 01:30:45.373
WAY TO GO IN TERMS OF INCREASING

01:30:45.439 --> 01:30:47.575
THE ACTAL REPRESENTATION OF

01:30:47.642 --> 01:30:50.311
PEOPLE OF COLOR ON THE BENCH.

01:30:50.378 --> 01:30:52.647
AND ONE THING THAT'S WORTH

01:30:52.713 --> 01:30:52.980
NOTING HERE.

01:30:53.047 --> 01:30:54.115
SORRY I WILL CLOSE UP QUITE

01:30:54.182 --> 01:30:55.483
QUICKLY I ONE THING THAT'S WORTH

01:30:55.550 --> 01:30:56.818
NOTING HERE IS THAT BLACK JUDGES

01:30:56.884 --> 01:30:58.686
HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT STRIDES IN

01:30:58.753 --> 01:30:59.787
TERMS OF REPRESENTATION MOVING

01:30:59.854 --> 01:31:01.088
FROM BEING UNDER REPRESENTED IN

01:31:01.155 --> 01:31:02.523
THE POPULATION TO ACTUAL SLIDE

01:31:02.590 --> 01:31:04.392
OVER REPRESENTATION -- BUT THIS

01:31:04.458 --> 01:31:05.860
DIVERSITY IS EXTREMELY LIMITED

01:31:05.927 --> 01:31:08.029
IN TERMS OF GEOGRAPHY WITH ONLY

01:31:08.095 --> 01:31:09.130
FORTY ONE OF CALIFORNIANS.

01:31:09.197 --> 01:31:10.464
I'M SORRY WITH FORTY ONE OF

01:31:10.531 --> 01:31:11.532
CALIFORNIA'S FIFTY EIGHT COUNTY

01:31:11.599 --> 01:31:12.934
TRIAL COURT STILL NOT HAVING A

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:14.502
SINGLE BLACK JURIST -- SO THAT'S

01:31:14.569 --> 01:31:15.102
HOW IT'S THAT ALTHOUGH WE'VE

01:31:15.169 --> 01:31:16.938
SEEN SOME IMPROVEMENTS IN

01:31:17.004 --> 01:31:18.105
GEOGRAPHICALLY LIMITED SCOPES

01:31:18.172 --> 01:31:20.141
AND IT'S NECESSARY TO CONTINUE

01:31:20.208 --> 01:31:21.742
AND EXPAND THESE DIVERSITY

01:31:21.809 --> 01:31:23.344
EFFORTS IN ORDER TO HAVE.

01:31:23.411 --> 01:31:24.745
SORT OF A STATE WIDE AB

01:31:24.812 --> 01:31:25.847
POPULATION OF JUDGES THAT

01:31:25.913 --> 01:31:27.715
REFLECTS THE DIVERSITY OF THE

01:31:27.782 --> 01:31:30.685
STATE AS A WHOLE AND I'LL STOP

01:31:30.751 --> 01:31:31.819
THERE IN THE INTEREST OF TIME.

01:31:31.886 --> 01:31:32.386
AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR

01:31:32.453 --> 01:31:32.987
GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO

01:31:33.054 --> 01:31:33.988
SPEAK THANK YOU THIS IS

01:31:34.055 --> 01:31:36.190
UNDERSCORES WHY WE LOVE HAVING A

01:31:36.257 --> 01:31:37.291
SCIENCE FELLOW.

01:31:37.358 --> 01:31:39.193
IN THE COMMITTEE TO BE ABLE TO

01:31:39.260 --> 01:31:40.728
DO THIS KIND OF DATA RESEARCH.

01:31:40.795 --> 01:31:44.065
PROFESSOR KARLAN -- THANK YOU

01:31:44.131 --> 01:31:44.665
FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK

01:31:44.732 --> 01:31:45.700
TODAY.

01:31:45.766 --> 01:31:47.001
THE GOALS OF MY REMARKS ARE TWO

01:31:47.068 --> 01:31:48.803
FOLD FIRST I'D LIKE TO PROVIDE

01:31:48.870 --> 01:31:50.471
SOME BROADER CONTEXTUAL FRAMING

01:31:50.538 --> 01:31:51.906
FOR EDUCATIONAL INEQUALITY IN

01:31:51.973 --> 01:31:53.374
THIS COUNTRY AND IN THE STATE.

01:31:53.441 --> 01:31:54.475
WHICH SETS THE STAGE FOR

01:31:54.542 --> 01:31:55.810
UNDERSTANDING THE EDUCATIONAL

01:31:55.877 --> 01:31:56.811
TRAJECTORIES.

01:31:56.878 --> 01:31:57.778
AB AND DISPARITIES IN

01:31:57.845 --> 01:31:59.046
EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT WE SEE

01:31:59.113 --> 01:32:00.648
PRIMARILY BY RACE ETHNICITY BUT

01:32:00.715 --> 01:32:02.049
ALSO BY SOCIO ECONOMIC

01:32:02.116 --> 01:32:03.050
DISADVANTAGE.

01:32:03.117 --> 01:32:04.151
AND SECOND I WILL UMMARIZE WHAT

01:32:04.218 --> 01:32:05.119
WE KNOW TO BE THE BIGGEST

01:32:05.186 --> 01:32:06.821
DETERMINANTS OF EDUCATIONAL

01:32:06.888 --> 01:32:08.256
ATTAINMENT AM INCLUDING ACT

01:32:08.322 --> 01:32:09.924
PROFESSIONAL SCHOOL.

01:32:09.991 --> 01:32:11.993
SO FIRST DAY TWO MINUTE I THINK

01:32:12.059 --> 01:32:13.394
PRIMER OF EDUCATIONAL EQUALITY.

01:32:13.461 --> 01:32:15.029
EDUCATION IS OFTEN VIEWED AS AN

01:32:15.096 --> 01:32:16.464
INDIVIDUAL PURSUIT BE HEARD SOME

01:32:16.530 --> 01:32:17.832
OF THAT THIS MORNING EDUCATIONAL

01:32:17.899 --> 01:32:19.567
PATHWAYS ARE MARKED.

01:32:19.634 --> 01:32:20.935
BY A SERIES OF CHOICES THAT

01:32:21.002 --> 01:32:22.169
INDIVIDUALS MAKE THAT SHAPE

01:32:22.236 --> 01:32:23.638
THEIR DESTINATIONS HOW MANY

01:32:23.704 --> 01:32:26.040
HONORS OR AP CLASSES TO TAKE HOW

01:32:26.107 --> 01:32:27.808
MUCH TO STUDY WHERE TO APPLY FOR

01:32:27.875 --> 01:32:29.210
COLLEGE WHAT TO MAJOR IN.

01:32:29.277 --> 01:32:30.811
AND WHETHER AND WHERE TO PURSUE

01:32:30.878 --> 01:32:32.246
GRADUATE STUDY.

01:32:32.313 --> 01:32:33.447
AND THIS VIEW PERMEATES OUR

01:32:33.514 --> 01:32:35.116
NARRATIVE OF EQUAL OPPORTUNITY

01:32:35.182 --> 01:32:36.350
AT THE IDEA THAT IF YOU WORK

01:32:36.417 --> 01:32:38.219
HARD AT SCHOOL ANYONE CAN AND

01:32:38.286 --> 01:32:39.353
OUT THAT.

01:32:39.420 --> 01:32:41.322
PICTURE ELITE SCHOOL OR BECOME A

01:32:41.389 --> 01:32:43.524
LAWYER OR FILL IN THE BLANK.

01:32:43.591 --> 01:32:45.026
THAT REALITY OF INDIVIDUAL

01:32:45.092 --> 01:32:46.560
CHOICE AND SELF DETERMINATION

01:32:46.627 --> 01:32:49.030
HOWEVER IS AT BEST MISLEADING.

01:32:49.096 --> 01:32:51.065
AND AT TO A VERY LARGE EXTENT

01:32:51.132 --> 01:32:52.833
BASICALLY UNTRUE.

01:32:52.900 --> 01:32:53.801
IN FACT RESEARCHERS HAVE

01:32:53.868 --> 01:32:55.469
REPEATEDLY DOCUMENTED THE WAYS

01:32:55.536 --> 01:32:56.971
IN WHICH INDIVIDUAL CHOICES ARE

01:32:57.038 --> 01:32:59.307
CONSTRAINED BY MULTIPLE SOCIETAL

01:32:59.373 --> 01:33:00.675
FORCES AN EDUCATIONAL

01:33:00.741 --> 01:33:02.476
INSTITUTIONS THAT SORT YOUNG

01:33:02.543 --> 01:33:03.344
PEOPLE.

01:33:03.411 --> 01:33:05.046
AMONG AN EQUAL PATHWAYS OF

01:33:05.112 --> 01:33:06.781
EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY.

01:33:06.847 --> 01:33:08.249
THESE CONSTRAIN CHOICES THAT

01:33:08.316 --> 01:33:10.484
TYPIFY OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM FROM

01:33:10.551 --> 01:33:12.153
EARLY CHILDHOOD INTO POST

01:33:12.219 --> 01:33:15.723
SECONDARY AND PROFESSIONAL

01:33:15.790 --> 01:33:16.390
SCHOOLING IN THE U. S..

01:33:16.457 --> 01:33:17.258
AND THEY'RE BOTH EXPLICIT

01:33:17.325 --> 01:33:18.492
INVISIBLE AS WELL AS MORE HIDDEN

01:33:18.559 --> 01:33:20.828
AND LESS VISIBLE BARRIERS.

01:33:20.895 --> 01:33:22.229
STUDENTS SCHOOLING EXPERIENCES

01:33:22.296 --> 01:33:23.798
IS THE DOMINANT WAYS IN WHICH

01:33:23.864 --> 01:33:25.299
EDUCATIONAL PATHWAYS ARE MARKED.

01:33:25.366 --> 01:33:27.101
MORE EXPLICITLY SCHOOL QUALITY

01:33:27.168 --> 01:33:30.104
AND CURRICULAR DIFFERENCES SORT.

01:33:30.171 --> 01:33:30.771
STUDENTS INTO EDUCATIONAL

01:33:30.838 --> 01:33:32.506
SETTINGS THAT DIFFER BY

01:33:32.573 --> 01:33:34.308
SUBSTANTIVE CONTENT PACE OF

01:33:34.375 --> 01:33:36.077
INSTRUCTION PEDAGOGICAL

01:33:36.143 --> 01:33:37.244
APPROACHES AND MANY OTHER

01:33:37.311 --> 01:33:38.512
RESOURCES.

01:33:38.579 --> 01:33:39.513
AND THIS DIFFERENCE IN START

01:33:39.580 --> 01:33:40.948
DIFFERENTIATION STARTS WITH

01:33:41.015 --> 01:33:42.984
ACCESS TO PRESCHOOL ENVIRONMENTS

01:33:43.050 --> 01:33:43.651
WHICH ARE HEARING MORE AND MORE

01:33:43.718 --> 01:33:45.286
ABOUT THESE DAYS THAT PROMOTE

01:33:45.353 --> 01:33:46.420
SCHOOL READINESS.

01:33:46.487 --> 01:33:47.955
GATEKEEPING COURSES IN MIDDLE

01:33:48.022 --> 01:33:49.757
SCHOOL YEARS RIGOROUS HIGH

01:33:49.824 --> 01:33:51.292
SCHOOL CURRICULA TO FACILITATE

01:33:51.359 --> 01:33:53.027
SUCCESSFUL TRANSITION INTO POST

01:33:53.094 --> 01:33:54.328
SECONDARY SCHOOLING.

01:33:54.395 --> 01:33:55.429
AND FINALLY SUCCESSFUL

01:33:55.496 --> 01:33:57.898
COMPLETION OF A COLLEGE DEGREE

01:33:57.965 --> 01:34:00.234
WITH A COMPETITIVE GPA AND

01:34:00.301 --> 01:34:02.570
PREPARATION FOR ADMITTANCE TO A

01:34:02.636 --> 01:34:03.037
PROFESSIONAL SCHOOL.

01:34:03.104 --> 01:34:04.472
AND WE'VE MADE GREAT EFFORTS TO

01:34:04.538 --> 01:34:05.873
EQUALIZE SOME OF THIS

01:34:05.940 --> 01:34:07.375
DIFFERENTIATION WHEN VISIBLE

01:34:07.441 --> 01:34:09.110
STATE FUNDED PRESCHOOL OUR

01:34:09.176 --> 01:34:10.644
SCHOOL FUNDING FORMULA.

01:34:10.711 --> 01:34:11.946
INCREASED ADVANCED PLACEMENT

01:34:12.013 --> 01:34:13.447
OFFERINGS IN SCHOOLS THAT SERVE

01:34:13.514 --> 01:34:15.349
AT LARGE PERCENTAGES OF SENSE

01:34:15.416 --> 01:34:15.883
ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED

01:34:15.950 --> 01:34:16.817
STUDENTS.

01:34:16.884 --> 01:34:18.452
BUT IN MANY CASES ACCESS TO GOOD

01:34:18.519 --> 01:34:20.054
INSTRUCTION OR OTHER COLLEGE

01:34:20.121 --> 01:34:21.222
PREPARATORY OPPORTUNITIES ARE

01:34:21.288 --> 01:34:23.124
LESS VISIBLE THESE INCLUDE

01:34:23.190 --> 01:34:24.992
UNEQUAL ACCESS TO SUCH COURSES

01:34:25.059 --> 01:34:26.293
WITH IN A SCHOOL.

01:34:26.360 --> 01:34:27.661
LESS ENCOURAGEMENT TO

01:34:27.728 --> 01:34:29.497
PARTICIPATE IN THOSE COURSES AND

01:34:29.563 --> 01:34:31.565
IN GENERAL LACK OF EXPOSURE TO

01:34:31.632 --> 01:34:32.967
THE PROFESSIONAL NETWORKS

01:34:33.034 --> 01:34:35.002
NECESSARY. TO REACH SOME OF

01:34:35.069 --> 01:34:37.972
THESE -- GATEKEEPING AT SPACES.

01:34:38.039 --> 01:34:38.973
SO STUDENTS ARE NOT RANDOMLY

01:34:39.040 --> 01:34:40.374
PLACED INTO THEIR EDUCATIONAL

01:34:40.441 --> 01:34:41.475
PATHWAYS BUT RATHER THEIR

01:34:41.542 --> 01:34:42.943
PATHWAYS ARE SHAPED YES BY THEIR

01:34:43.010 --> 01:34:44.378
INDIVIDUAL DETERMINATION BUT

01:34:44.445 --> 01:34:45.713
IMPORTANTLY BY THE OPPORTUNITIES

01:34:45.780 --> 01:34:47.181
THAT THEY ARE EXPOSED.

01:34:47.248 --> 01:34:48.149
TO AND THE RESULT IS THAT

01:34:48.215 --> 01:34:49.650
EDUCATIONAL PATHWAYS TEND TO

01:34:49.717 --> 01:34:51.085
SELF PERPETUATE.

01:34:51.152 --> 01:34:52.119
THAT IS QUALITY EARLY SCHOOLING

01:34:52.186 --> 01:34:53.521
EXPERIENCES BEGET BETTER

01:34:53.587 --> 01:34:55.056
PLACEMENT INTO SECONDARY SCHOOL

01:34:55.122 --> 01:34:56.190
DECISIONS.

01:34:56.257 --> 01:34:57.725
AND THEN MORE INTENSE ACADEMIC

01:34:57.792 --> 01:34:58.726
RIGOR IN HIGH SCHOOL THAT

01:34:58.793 --> 01:34:59.827
RESULTS IN MORE SELECTIVE

01:34:59.894 --> 01:35:01.362
COLLEGE ADMISSION.

01:35:01.429 --> 01:35:02.696
AND GREATER LIKELIHOOD OF DEGREE

01:35:02.763 --> 01:35:04.231
ATTAINMENT IT TO BEGIN WITH BUT

01:35:04.298 --> 01:35:05.733
ALSO PROFESSIONS FURTHER

01:35:05.800 --> 01:35:07.501
PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLING OR LABOR

01:35:07.568 --> 01:35:08.502
MARKET SUCCESS.

01:35:08.569 --> 01:35:09.837
SO THE PRIMARY WAY IN WHICH

01:35:09.904 --> 01:35:11.605
EDUCATORS AND POLICYMAKERS HOPE

01:35:11.672 --> 01:35:13.374
TO BREAK THIS SELF PERPETUATING

01:35:13.441 --> 01:35:15.209
NATURE OF EDUCATIONAL PATHWAYS.

01:35:15.276 --> 01:35:16.911
AND IMPROVE MOBILITY BETWEEN

01:35:16.977 --> 01:35:18.446
EDUCATIONAL DESTINATIONS IS

01:35:18.512 --> 01:35:19.814
THROUGH INCREASED ACCESS AND

01:35:19.880 --> 01:35:20.848
OPPORTUNITIES.

01:35:20.915 --> 01:35:22.650
HOWEVER TOO OFTEN WE RELY ON THE

01:35:22.716 --> 01:35:24.118
SET OF INPUTS THAT DIRECTLY

01:35:24.185 --> 01:35:26.020
REFLECT THAT ACCUMULATED

01:35:26.087 --> 01:35:27.421
ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES

01:35:27.488 --> 01:35:29.290
BETTER REFLECTED IN THAT SAT

01:35:29.356 --> 01:35:31.225
SCORE OR ELSE OUT SCORE OR THE

01:35:31.292 --> 01:35:32.827
SELECTIVITY OF THE UNDERGRADUATE

01:35:32.893 --> 01:35:34.028
INSTITUTION.

01:35:34.095 --> 01:35:35.529
AND AS A RESULT THE RACIAL

01:35:35.596 --> 01:35:36.964
ETHNIC OR SOCIOECONOMIC

01:35:37.031 --> 01:35:38.199
DISADVANTAGE GAP THAT WE SEE ON

01:35:38.265 --> 01:35:39.600
THESE ASSESSMENTS AND HERE I

01:35:39.667 --> 01:35:40.835
SPEAK TO STANDARDIZED TESTS IN

01:35:40.901 --> 01:35:41.836
PARTICULAR.

01:35:41.902 --> 01:35:43.437
ARE SIMPLY HOLDING UP A MIRROR

01:35:43.504 --> 01:35:44.538
TO THE INEQUITIES IN OUR

01:35:44.605 --> 01:35:47.541
EDUCATION SYSTEM AND IN SOCIETY

01:35:47.608 --> 01:35:48.375
AS A WHOLE.

01:35:48.442 --> 01:35:49.276
SO ALTHOUGH HIGHER EDUCATION AND

01:35:49.343 --> 01:35:50.978
LEGAL EDUCATION IN THIS CASE MAY

01:35:51.045 --> 01:35:52.813
NOT SEE ITSELF AS RESPONSIBLE

01:35:52.880 --> 01:35:54.582
FOR THESE THESE INEQUALITIES.

01:35:54.648 --> 01:35:55.749
THE ONLY WAY TO REDUCE THESE

01:35:55.816 --> 01:35:57.118
INEQUALITIES IS TO EQUALIZE

01:35:57.184 --> 01:35:59.487
EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES EARLIER

01:35:59.553 --> 01:36:01.689
AND STUDENTS EDUCATIONAL CAREERS.

01:36:01.755 --> 01:36:03.157
SO WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT

01:36:03.224 --> 01:36:03.691
DETERMINES OF EDUCATIONAL

01:36:03.757 --> 01:36:04.725
ATTAINMENT.

01:36:04.792 --> 01:36:06.527
SUMMARIZING ABROAD AND MULTI

01:36:06.594 --> 01:36:07.928
DISCIPLINARY LITERATURE ON

01:36:07.995 --> 01:36:09.396
PREDICTORS OF POSTSECONDARY

01:36:09.463 --> 01:36:11.932
SUCCESS INCLUDING GRADUATE STUDY

01:36:11.999 --> 01:36:12.600
I WOULD SAY THERE ARE THREE MAIN

01:36:12.666 --> 01:36:13.601
BUCKETS.

01:36:13.667 --> 01:36:14.668
THE FIRST IS ACADEMIC

01:36:14.735 --> 01:36:17.004
PREPARATION STUDENTS EXPOSED TO

01:36:17.071 --> 01:36:18.405
A MORE ACADEMICALLY RIGOROUS

01:36:18.472 --> 01:36:19.840
COURSE OF STUDY ARE BETTER

01:36:19.907 --> 01:36:20.908
PREPARED FOR THE DEMANDS OF

01:36:20.975 --> 01:36:22.143
COLLEGE AND ARE MORE LIKELY TO

01:36:22.209 --> 01:36:23.277
COMPLETE COLLEGE.

01:36:23.344 --> 01:36:24.478
AND ARE MORE LIKELY TO GO TO

01:36:24.545 --> 01:36:26.413
GRADUATE SCHOOL THIS IMPACTS

01:36:26.480 --> 01:36:28.182
GRADUATE STUDY IN SEVERAL WAYS

01:36:28.249 --> 01:36:29.650
FIRST IS OBVIOUSLY PREPARATION

01:36:29.717 --> 01:36:30.751
FOR LAW SCHOOL OR ANY OTHER

01:36:30.818 --> 01:36:32.086
GRADUATE SCHOOL.

01:36:32.153 --> 01:36:33.821
WHICH IS OFTEN POORLY UNDERSTOOD

01:36:33.888 --> 01:36:35.256
BUT WE PROXY FOR IT BY THE

01:36:35.322 --> 01:36:36.957
SELECTIVITY OF THE UNDERGRADUATE

01:36:37.024 --> 01:36:40.027
INSTITUTION OUR COLLEGE GPA.

01:36:40.094 --> 01:36:41.262
HOWEVER STUDENTS OFTEN ENTER

01:36:41.328 --> 01:36:42.596
COLLEGE WITH THIS AN EQUAL

01:36:42.663 --> 01:36:44.031
PREPARATION MANY STRUGGLE TO

01:36:44.098 --> 01:36:46.100
MAINTAIN A STRONG ENOUGH GPA TO

01:36:46.167 --> 01:36:47.735
BE COMPETITIVE FOR LAW SCHOOL.

01:36:47.801 --> 01:36:49.537
OR ARE SIMPLY SELF SELECTING OUT

01:36:49.603 --> 01:36:51.105
OF GRADUATE STUDY GIVEN THE

01:36:51.172 --> 01:36:54.108
CONSISTENT NEGATIVE SIGNALS THEY

01:36:54.175 --> 01:36:54.742
GET FROM THE GRADES IN THE FIRST

01:36:54.808 --> 01:36:55.743
PLACE.

01:36:55.809 --> 01:36:57.545
THE SECOND BUCKET IS ON COLLEGE

01:36:57.611 --> 01:36:58.946
OR GRADUATE SCHOOL KNOWLEDGE AND

01:36:59.013 --> 01:37:00.080
INFORMATION.

01:37:00.147 --> 01:37:00.948
THERE ARE A HOST OF

01:37:01.015 --> 01:37:01.982
INFORMATIONAL BARRIERS THAT

01:37:02.049 --> 01:37:03.184
PRESENT A CHALLENGE TO

01:37:03.250 --> 01:37:04.385
HISTORICALLY UNDER REPRESENTED

01:37:04.451 --> 01:37:05.753
GROUPS AND POST SECONDARY

01:37:05.819 --> 01:37:06.887
SCHOOLING.

01:37:06.954 --> 01:37:08.155
THESE INCLUDE INFORMATION ABOUT

01:37:08.222 --> 01:37:10.124
COSTS AND EDUCATION FINANCING

01:37:10.191 --> 01:37:11.525
KNOWLEDGE OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF

01:37:11.592 --> 01:37:12.760
GRADUATE SCHOOL OPTIONS FIELDS

01:37:12.826 --> 01:37:14.862
OF STUDY AND APPLICATION

01:37:14.929 --> 01:37:16.931
PROCEDURES AND I COULD GO ON NOT --

01:37:16.997 --> 01:37:18.265
AND THESE INFORMATION BARRIERS

01:37:18.332 --> 01:37:19.900
ARE THE ONES WE HERE WE HEARD

01:37:19.967 --> 01:37:21.368
SOME TODAY OUR OUR OUR EFFORTS

01:37:21.435 --> 01:37:23.137
AT AT PROGRAMS OF TRYING TO

01:37:23.204 --> 01:37:24.238
REMEDY.

01:37:24.305 --> 01:37:25.973
FINALLY THE OTHER BUCKET IS KIND

01:37:26.040 --> 01:37:27.508
OF SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS

01:37:27.575 --> 01:37:29.009
IT'S HARD TO DO THIS BROAD AREA

01:37:29.076 --> 01:37:30.044
OF JUSTICE.

01:37:30.110 --> 01:37:31.712
IT IS BROAD AREA JUSTICE IN A

01:37:31.779 --> 01:37:32.846
FEW SENTENCES BUT IN SHORT

01:37:32.913 --> 01:37:34.481
NAVIGATING COLLEGE AND GRADUATE

01:37:34.548 --> 01:37:35.783
SCHOOL CAN BE HARD.

01:37:35.849 --> 01:37:37.151
NO MATTER HOW WELL PREPARED YOU

01:37:37.218 --> 01:37:38.519
ARE ACADEMICALLY OR HOW MUCH

01:37:38.586 --> 01:37:39.887
INFORMATION YOU HAVE.

01:37:39.954 --> 01:37:41.088
AND SCHOLARS FROM ACROSS THE

01:37:41.155 --> 01:37:42.890
SOCIAL SCIENCE DISCIPLINES HAVE

01:37:42.957 --> 01:37:44.491
DOCUMENTED THE NEED TO CULTIVATE

01:37:44.558 --> 01:37:46.193
A SENSE OF RESILIENCE AND SELF

01:37:46.260 --> 01:37:48.295
ADVOCACY NECESSARY. FOR CAL FOR

01:37:48.362 --> 01:37:49.563
COLLEGE AND GRADUATE SCHOOL

01:37:49.630 --> 01:37:51.232
SUCCESS AND WHICH WE KNOW IS

01:37:51.298 --> 01:37:52.666
EVEN HARDER FOR STUDENTS WHO MAY

01:37:52.733 --> 01:37:54.268
BE THE FIRST IN THEIR FAMILIES

01:37:54.335 --> 01:37:55.236
TO GO TO COLLEGE OR GRADUATE

01:37:55.302 --> 01:37:56.570
SCHOOL HAVE TO WORK WHILE

01:37:56.637 --> 01:37:57.271
THEY'RE IN SCHOOL.

01:37:57.338 --> 01:37:59.006
OR MAY NOT HAVE THE MANY PEERS

01:37:59.073 --> 01:38:00.741
OR MENTORS THAT COME FROM RACIAL

01:38:00.808 --> 01:38:03.677
ETHNIC OR SAYS OR SOCIAL

01:38:03.744 --> 01:38:04.511
BACKGROUNDS LIKE THEIR OWN.

01:38:04.578 --> 01:38:05.546
THESE THREE AREAS ARE OFTEN THE

01:38:05.613 --> 01:38:07.081
TARGET OF VARIOUS PIPELINE

01:38:07.147 --> 01:38:08.182
PROGRAMS THAT ASSIST

01:38:08.249 --> 01:38:09.883
UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS FROM

01:38:09.950 --> 01:38:10.684
HISTORICALLY UNDERREPRESENTED

01:38:10.751 --> 01:38:11.552
GROUPS.

01:38:11.619 --> 01:38:13.821
WITH A HOST OF ACADEMIC SUPPORTS

01:38:13.887 --> 01:38:15.522
INCREASED INFORMATION ABOUT OUT

01:38:15.589 --> 01:38:17.124
ALL ASPECTS OF GRADUATE STUDY

01:38:17.191 --> 01:38:19.059
FROM APPLICATION MEETING HOW TO

01:38:19.126 --> 01:38:20.227
MEET WITH A FACULTY MEMBER TO

01:38:20.294 --> 01:38:20.694
ASK FOR A LETTER OF

01:38:20.761 --> 01:38:21.895
RECOMMENDATION.

01:38:21.962 --> 01:38:23.230
AND TO UNDERSTAND THE PROFESSION

01:38:23.297 --> 01:38:24.932
MORE GENERALLY.

01:38:24.999 --> 01:38:26.200
AND VARIOUS EFFORTS FOR SELF

01:38:26.267 --> 01:38:27.368
AFFIRMATION AND SOCIAL BELONG

01:38:27.434 --> 01:38:29.470
EXPERIENCES ACT AGAIN ARE HUGELY

01:38:29.536 --> 01:38:31.272
CRITICAL -- FOR PARTICULARLY

01:38:31.338 --> 01:38:33.474
CERTAIN SUBGROUPS SO IN SOME

01:38:33.540 --> 01:38:35.042
HIGHER EDUCATION INCLUDING

01:38:35.109 --> 01:38:36.944
GRADUATE STUDY CAN DISREGARD OR

01:38:37.011 --> 01:38:38.545
IGNORED WHAT CAME BEFORE WHICH

01:38:38.612 --> 01:38:39.980
MAY SEEM PREFERABLE GIVEN THE

01:38:40.047 --> 01:38:41.215
COMPLEXITY.

01:38:41.282 --> 01:38:42.383
BUT MOST HIGHER EDUCATION

01:38:42.449 --> 01:38:43.684
INSTITUTIONS INCLUDING LAW

01:38:43.751 --> 01:38:45.786
SCHOOLS FEEL SOME RESPONSIBILITY

01:38:45.853 --> 01:38:47.354
TO ADDRESS THESE DEEP INEQUITIES

01:38:47.421 --> 01:38:48.989
THAT RESULT IN THE KINDS OF

01:38:49.056 --> 01:38:50.491
ADMISSIONS PROFILE THAT THE SEAT.

01:38:50.557 --> 01:38:52.192
SO HOW THEY DO SO HAS IMPORTANT

01:38:52.259 --> 01:38:53.794
CONSEQUENCES NOT JUST FOR THE

01:38:53.861 --> 01:38:55.095
CURRENT STUDENTS BUT FOR MANY

01:38:55.162 --> 01:38:56.397
STUDENTS TO CALM.

01:38:56.463 --> 01:38:58.265
AND ADMISSION IS ONLY ONE ASPECT

01:38:58.332 --> 01:38:59.767
OF THIS EFFORT I'LL BE AN

01:38:59.833 --> 01:39:01.502
IMPORTANT ONE BUT SUSTAIN

01:39:01.568 --> 01:39:03.237
SUPPORT THROUGH GRADUATE STUDY

01:39:03.304 --> 01:39:03.904
IN.

01:39:03.971 --> 01:39:05.839
AN INTO THE PROFESSION REQUIRES

01:39:05.906 --> 01:39:07.808
EARLIER INVESTMENTS IN ACADEMIC

01:39:07.875 --> 01:39:09.276
PREPARATION IN REDUCING

01:39:09.343 --> 01:39:10.878
INFORMATIONAL BARRIERS AT IN

01:39:10.944 --> 01:39:12.246
CULTIVATING THE ENVIRONMENT THAT

01:39:12.313 --> 01:39:14.081
IS INCLUSIVE AND WELCOMING TO

01:39:14.148 --> 01:39:15.249
HISTORICALLY IS STARKLY

01:39:15.316 --> 01:39:16.483
UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS.

01:39:16.550 --> 01:39:18.052
SO WHILE IT IS ALWAYS INSPIRING

01:39:18.118 --> 01:39:19.253
FOR ME AS WELL TO HEAR THE

01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:21.121
STORIES OF PERSONAL STORIES IN

01:39:21.188 --> 01:39:22.022
PARTICULAR.

01:39:22.089 --> 01:39:23.590
HAVE THE CURRENT STUDENT KAREN

01:39:23.657 --> 01:39:25.492
BUT RAZA -- IT IS TIME THAT WE

01:39:25.559 --> 01:39:27.027
MOVE BEYOND JUST THAT THE BEAT

01:39:27.094 --> 01:39:28.696
THE ODDS STORY TO COMPLETELY

01:39:28.762 --> 01:39:31.765
CHANGE CHANGE THOUGHT SO.

01:39:31.832 --> 01:39:33.033
STOP [inaudible]

01:39:33.100 --> 01:39:33.667
THANK YOU [inaudible]

01:39:33.734 --> 01:39:35.602
GREAT.

01:39:35.669 --> 01:39:37.538
WE ARE TO TEAM BUTLER.

01:39:37.604 --> 01:39:38.906
PLEASE GOOD MORNING.

01:39:38.972 --> 01:39:41.775
SO -- I WAS ACTS TO SPEAK ON

01:39:41.842 --> 01:39:43.077
UNDERSTANDING THE SCOPE OF THIS

01:39:43.143 --> 01:39:44.545
PROBLEM IN THE CONTEXT OF THE

01:39:44.611 --> 01:39:48.982
GRE AND I AM HERE REPRESENTING A

01:39:49.049 --> 01:39:51.218
PROJECT AS WELL SO I WANTED TO

01:39:51.285 --> 01:39:52.286
SAY A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT AND

01:39:52.353 --> 01:39:53.721
THEN I'LL GET INTO.

01:39:53.787 --> 01:39:56.790
A DISCUSSION BUT I'M PART OF A

01:39:56.857 --> 01:39:59.560
OF A OF THREE CAMPUS PROJECT

01:39:59.626 --> 01:40:01.962
THAT IS LOOKING AT THE ISSUE

01:40:02.029 --> 01:40:03.630
THAT YOU ALL ARE LOOKING AT HERE

01:40:03.697 --> 01:40:05.199
IN THE LEGAL EDUCATION IT'S THE

01:40:05.265 --> 01:40:06.600
ALLIANCE FOR MULTI CAMPUS

01:40:06.667 --> 01:40:09.536
INCLUSIVE GRADUATE ADMISSIONS --

01:40:09.603 --> 01:40:11.939
WE CALL IT A MICAH AT UC DAVIS

01:40:12.005 --> 01:40:14.074
AS THE LEAD CAMPUS WITH --

01:40:14.141 --> 01:40:16.477
PROVOST RALPH TEXTER AS THE PI

01:40:16.543 --> 01:40:18.812
IN ONE OF THE DIVERSITY OFFICERS

01:40:18.879 --> 01:40:20.781
WITHIN THE GRAD DIVISION JUST OF

01:40:20.848 --> 01:40:22.850
THE MONEY AND ALL AS THE CO PI.

01:40:22.916 --> 01:40:24.818
AND WE ALSO HAVE PARTNERS AT

01:40:24.885 --> 01:40:27.221
UCLA AND USC AND THIS QUESTION

01:40:27.287 --> 01:40:28.489
IS HAS A RESIDENT HIGHER

01:40:28.555 --> 01:40:30.724
EDUCATION REGARDING STANDARDIZED

01:40:30.791 --> 01:40:32.926
TESTING AND THE BEAR YEARS THAT

01:40:32.993 --> 01:40:34.328
IT IS CREATING.

01:40:34.395 --> 01:40:36.363
FOR DIVERSE STUDENTS ACROSS THE

01:40:36.430 --> 01:40:38.866
THE PLANE AND HOW THEY ARE ABLE

01:40:38.932 --> 01:40:41.335
TO ACCESS -- HIGHER EDUCATION

01:40:41.402 --> 01:40:42.569
WHETHER IT BE GRADUATE SCHOOL

01:40:42.636 --> 01:40:44.905
PROFESSIONAL SCHOOL AND AND HOW

01:40:44.972 --> 01:40:47.508
IMPORTANT OR IMPERATIVE IT IS

01:40:47.574 --> 01:40:52.413
THAT OUR PROFESSIONALS.

01:40:52.479 --> 01:40:53.747
ARE ACTUALLY.

01:40:53.814 --> 01:40:55.849
MATCHING OUR DISTRIBUTION OF

01:40:55.916 --> 01:40:57.818
POPULATIONS ACROSS OUR STATE IN

01:40:57.885 --> 01:41:01.388
OUR NATION AND SO -- OUR GOAL IN

01:41:01.455 --> 01:41:02.990
THE PROJECT IS TO REALLY TRY.

01:41:03.056 --> 01:41:04.391
TO FIND A WAY THAT WE CAN MAKE

01:41:04.458 --> 01:41:05.759
THAT DISTRIBUTION OF THE

01:41:05.826 --> 01:41:06.927
POPULATION IN THE STATE OF

01:41:06.994 --> 01:41:08.228
CALIFORNIA.

01:41:08.295 --> 01:41:11.231
AND WHEN I SAW THIS TOPIC ONE I

01:41:11.298 --> 01:41:12.699
WAS NOT A WEIRD THAT WITHIN THE

01:41:12.766 --> 01:41:14.568
LEGAL PROFESSION THE CONTEXT WAS

01:41:14.635 --> 01:41:16.069
CHANGING IN THE SENSE THAT THERE

01:41:16.136 --> 01:41:17.738
WAS AN AD INTEREST IN

01:41:17.805 --> 01:41:20.374
DIVERSIFYING ADMISSIONS.

01:41:20.441 --> 01:41:21.608
TO LAW SCHOOL.

01:41:21.675 --> 01:41:24.678
IN AN INTEREST TO DIVERSIFY THAT

01:41:24.745 --> 01:41:27.181
PROCESS THE GRE THE GRADUATE

01:41:27.247 --> 01:41:29.149
RECORD EXAM WAS LOOK TO AS THE

01:41:29.216 --> 01:41:32.152
POSSIBILITY TO OFFER THIS --

01:41:32.219 --> 01:41:34.621
OPPORTUNITY HOWEVER WITHIN THE

01:41:34.688 --> 01:41:36.924
CONTEXT OF GRADUATE EDUCATION WE

01:41:36.990 --> 01:41:38.659
ARE QUESTIONING THE USE AND DE

01:41:38.725 --> 01:41:41.795
EMPHASIZING THE USE OF THE GRE.

01:41:41.862 --> 01:41:43.997
SO I WILL APPROACH IT THIS WAY

01:41:44.064 --> 01:41:45.365
AND I THINK YOU ALL HAPPENED THE

01:41:45.432 --> 01:41:47.768
HAND OUTS HERE I'M I APOLOGIZE

01:41:47.835 --> 01:41:49.570
TO THOSE OUT IN THE AUDIENCE BUT

01:41:49.636 --> 01:41:51.371
THE PROBLEM HOW CAN WE IN

01:41:51.438 --> 01:41:52.739
CALIFORNIA INCREASE THE

01:41:52.806 --> 01:41:53.540
DIVERSITY OF THE LEGAL

01:41:53.607 --> 01:41:54.942
PROFESSION AND THE DUDE.

01:41:55.008 --> 01:41:57.177
JUDICIARY -- BASICALLY THE

01:41:57.244 --> 01:41:59.546
ARGUMENTS THAT I SAW TO BE THE

01:41:59.613 --> 01:42:01.748
DRIVING FORCES THAT THE G. R. E.

01:42:01.815 --> 01:42:03.817
WHAT X. BAN ACCESS TO LEGAL

01:42:03.884 --> 01:42:05.853
EDUCATION THE POOL OF TEST

01:42:05.919 --> 01:42:07.654
TAKERS IT'S WITHIN THE JURY ARE

01:42:07.721 --> 01:42:10.090
MUCH HIGHER THAN THOSE.

01:42:10.157 --> 01:42:11.625
WITHIN THE ELSE THAT.

01:42:11.692 --> 01:42:13.527
HOWEVER I WILL SHARE THAT THE

01:42:13.594 --> 01:42:17.264
DIVERSE CITY ACROSS IT'S NOT --

01:42:17.331 --> 01:42:19.466
ANY MORE DIVERSE ACROSS THE GRE

01:42:19.533 --> 01:42:21.468
AND THE JET THE GRE TEST HAS

01:42:21.535 --> 01:42:23.170
ALSO BEEN EVALUATED AS BEING

01:42:23.237 --> 01:42:27.407
BALLOT AND RELIABLE -- HOWEVER

01:42:27.474 --> 01:42:32.913
BIASED -- SO THE DIVERSITY TOOL

01:42:32.980 --> 01:42:35.048
THE G. R. E..

01:42:35.115 --> 01:42:37.551
TEST TAKERS THERE ARE OVER THREE

01:42:37.618 --> 01:42:39.720
TIMES TO FOUR TIMES AS MANY TEST

01:42:39.786 --> 01:42:41.522
TAKERS OF THE GRE COMPARED TO

01:42:41.588 --> 01:42:42.789
THE L. SAID.

01:42:42.856 --> 01:42:44.558
SO I THINK THE ARGUMENT THAT THE

01:42:44.625 --> 01:42:46.260
POOL OF APPLICANTS COULD

01:42:46.326 --> 01:42:48.061
INCREASE IS BALLOT.

01:42:48.128 --> 01:42:50.030
HOWEVER THERE IS A QUESTION

01:42:50.097 --> 01:42:51.832
ACROSS THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE

01:42:51.899 --> 01:42:53.267
POPULATION WHO ARE TAKING THE

01:42:53.333 --> 01:42:55.602
TEST AND THEY ALMOST NEAR EACH

01:42:55.669 --> 01:42:57.704
OTHER SO WITH IN THE ELSE THAT

01:42:57.771 --> 01:43:00.040
YOU HAVE ABOUT 80% OF THE TEST

01:43:00.107 --> 01:43:00.407
TAKERS.

01:43:00.474 --> 01:43:03.043
WHITE THE SAME EXIST WITH THE G.

01:43:03.110 --> 01:43:04.545
R. E. WHEN YOU LOOK AT U. S.

01:43:04.611 --> 01:43:07.214
DOMESTIC TEST TAKERS.

01:43:07.281 --> 01:43:08.749
THE DISTRIBUTION OF ASIAN.

01:43:08.815 --> 01:43:10.717
AMERICANS IS SLIGHTLY INCREASED

01:43:10.784 --> 01:43:14.655
IN THE GRE BUT 12214% ONLY 8% IN

01:43:14.721 --> 01:43:16.256
THE L. SAT WITH AFRICAN

01:43:16.323 --> 01:43:18.825
AMERICANS -- BEING ABOUT THE

01:43:18.892 --> 01:43:21.562
SAME DISTRIBUTION 12214% ACROSS

01:43:21.628 --> 01:43:24.298
BOTH THE JURY AND THE L. SAT AND

01:43:24.364 --> 01:43:27.034
THEN -- LATIN X. MEXICAN%

01:43:27.100 --> 01:43:28.368
HISPANIC NON WHITE.

01:43:28.435 --> 01:43:31.939
TEST TAKERS ARE SLIGHTLY HIGHER

01:43:32.005 --> 01:43:34.308
IN THE L. SAP VERSES THE G. R.

01:43:34.374 --> 01:43:37.744
E. WITH ONLY ABOUT. 628% TAKING

01:43:37.811 --> 01:43:40.948
THE GRE AND 10% TAKING THE L.

01:43:41.014 --> 01:43:43.417
SAT NATIVE AMERICANS ARE ALSO

01:43:43.483 --> 01:43:45.085
OVER REPRESENT AND TAKING THE L.

01:43:45.152 --> 01:43:47.254
FAT VERSUS TAKING THE GRE WITH

01:43:47.321 --> 01:43:48.589
ABOUT 10%.

01:43:48.655 --> 01:43:50.157
OF NATIVE AMERICANS TAKING THE

01:43:50.223 --> 01:43:54.561
TEST VERSUS 4% [inaudible]

01:43:54.628 --> 01:43:56.697
TAKING -- THAT JERRY.

01:43:56.763 --> 01:43:58.899
SO I JUST WANTED TO POINT OUT

01:43:58.966 --> 01:44:00.601
THAT THERE IS SOME.

01:44:00.667 --> 01:44:01.969
POSSIBILITY OF INCREASING

01:44:02.035 --> 01:44:04.071
DIVERSITY HOWEVER I WANT TO

01:44:04.137 --> 01:44:06.073
CAUTION WHEN WE SPEAK TO

01:44:06.139 --> 01:44:08.008
DIVERSITY IN USING TOOLS. TO DO

01:44:08.075 --> 01:44:11.645
THE WORK FOR US BECAUSE OF THEIR

01:44:11.712 --> 01:44:14.114
LIMITATIONS AND POSSIBLY -- BUT

01:44:14.181 --> 01:44:16.450
DISPARITIES THAT EXIST IN THE

01:44:16.516 --> 01:44:20.554
JURY'S -- SCORES SO THE GRE TEST

01:44:20.621 --> 01:44:22.456
REFLECT DISPARITIES AS MY

01:44:22.522 --> 01:44:24.758
COLLEAGUE MCCALL HAS MENTIONED

01:44:24.825 --> 01:44:27.961
THAT MIRROR BASICALLY THE SOCIO

01:44:28.028 --> 01:44:30.564
ECONOMIC -- DIFFERENCES

01:44:30.631 --> 01:44:32.766
DIFFERENCES ACROSS RACIAL BOUNDS

01:44:32.833 --> 01:44:35.435
OF POVERTY -- GENDER DIFFERENCES

01:44:35.502 --> 01:44:37.170
IN AND IT.

01:44:37.237 --> 01:44:38.572
HAS NOT BEEN CLEAR OF HOW TO

01:44:38.639 --> 01:44:40.240
CORRECT THE DIFFERENCES IN THE

01:44:40.307 --> 01:44:42.809
DISTRIBUTION OF THE GRE TEST AND

01:44:42.876 --> 01:44:44.611
SO WE WANT TO CAUTION AS WE'RE

01:44:44.678 --> 01:44:46.246
USING THIS TOOL.

01:44:46.313 --> 01:44:49.049
IN OUR ADMISSIONS PROCESS.

01:44:49.116 --> 01:44:50.550
I HAVE A GRAPHIC THAT I'VE

01:44:50.617 --> 01:44:52.853
SHARED JUST SO YOU CAN VISUALLY

01:44:52.919 --> 01:44:54.755
SEE IN THOSE WHO HAVE.

01:44:54.821 --> 01:44:57.624
THE PACKET THAT BASICALLY IF YOU

01:44:57.691 --> 01:44:58.725
JUST LOOK ACROSS THE

01:44:58.792 --> 01:45:00.327
DISTRIBUTION WHAT YOU'RE SEEING

01:45:00.394 --> 01:45:02.763
IS ASIAN AMERICANS WHITES.

01:45:02.829 --> 01:45:05.365
OTHER HISPANIC A MEXICAN AFRICAN

01:45:05.432 --> 01:45:06.633
AMERICANS PORTER RICANS THE

01:45:06.700 --> 01:45:07.734
NATIVE AMERICANS ARE

01:45:07.801 --> 01:45:09.803
DIFFERENTIALLY DISTRIBUTED

01:45:09.870 --> 01:45:12.673
ACROSS THE BOARD ON THEIR SCORES

01:45:12.739 --> 01:45:14.441
OF THE G. R. E..

01:45:14.508 --> 01:45:16.443
N. IF WE HAVE CERTAIN SCORES ARE

01:45:16.510 --> 01:45:19.913
CUT OFF THEN HUGE POPULATIONS

01:45:19.980 --> 01:45:22.182
ARE DISADVANTAGED AUTOMATICALLY

01:45:22.249 --> 01:45:24.484
IF WE'RE USING THE SCORES AS OUR

01:45:24.551 --> 01:45:28.655
PRIMARY INDICATOR OF SUCCESS IN

01:45:28.722 --> 01:45:29.556
OUR ADMISSIONS PROCESS THE

01:45:29.623 --> 01:45:31.191
CONTINUING ALTHOUGH THE JURY

01:45:31.258 --> 01:45:33.760
PROVIDES A A LARGER POOL.

01:45:33.827 --> 01:45:36.763
OF APPLICANTS FOR LAW SCHOOL THE

01:45:36.830 --> 01:45:38.665
DIP TO HIGHLIGHT THE THE

01:45:38.732 --> 01:45:39.599
LIMITATIONS OF THE POOR

01:45:39.666 --> 01:45:41.935
PERFORMANCE DIFFERENTIALS ACROSS

01:45:42.002 --> 01:45:44.071
THE APPLICANTS THE JURY IS ONLY

01:45:44.137 --> 01:45:46.239
MODESTLY PREDICTIVE OF STUDENT

01:45:46.306 --> 01:45:47.207
SUCCESS.

01:45:47.274 --> 01:45:48.375
AND THIS IS REALLY CLEAR EVEN

01:45:48.442 --> 01:45:50.911
ETS EDUCATIONAL TESTING SERVICE

01:45:50.977 --> 01:45:53.480
ALSO STATES THAT THE JURY ONLY

01:45:53.547 --> 01:45:55.549
MODESTLY PREDICTS SUCCESS AND

01:45:55.615 --> 01:45:57.651
IT'S TYPICALLY THE FIRST TWO

01:45:57.718 --> 01:45:59.553
YEARS OF COURSEWORK. FOR

01:45:59.619 --> 01:46:01.221
STUDENTS NOT REALLY PREDICTING

01:46:01.288 --> 01:46:02.489
SOME OF THE FACTORS THAT WERE

01:46:02.556 --> 01:46:03.957
MOST INTERESTED IN WHEN WE'RE

01:46:04.024 --> 01:46:05.192
LOOKING AT STUDENTS AND THEIR

01:46:05.258 --> 01:46:07.227
ABILITIES TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN

01:46:07.294 --> 01:46:08.662
GRADUATE EDUCATION.

01:46:08.729 --> 01:46:12.499
AND PERSIST BEYOND -- GRADUATE

01:46:12.566 --> 01:46:14.367
SCHOOL.

01:46:14.434 --> 01:46:15.836
I'M GONNA TRY TO GO FASTER HAD

01:46:15.902 --> 01:46:17.704
LOTS TO SAY -- IN IT'S ALSO

01:46:17.771 --> 01:46:19.840
IMPORTANT THAT WE NOTE ONE OF

01:46:19.906 --> 01:46:20.607
THE THINGS THAT HAS BEEN

01:46:20.674 --> 01:46:23.510
HIGHLIGHTED BY SCHOLARS IS THAT.

01:46:23.577 --> 01:46:25.612
WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT THE SCORES

01:46:25.679 --> 01:46:27.414
AND DISTRIBUTION IT IS ALSO

01:46:27.481 --> 01:46:28.515
IMPORTANT THAT WE CONSIDER

01:46:28.582 --> 01:46:30.117
CHANGING THE CULTURES WHICH ARE

01:46:30.183 --> 01:46:33.086
EVALUATING THE STUDENTS AND

01:46:33.153 --> 01:46:33.386
THEIR WORK?

01:46:33.453 --> 01:46:34.521
SO.

01:46:34.588 --> 01:46:36.423
I THINK THIS KEBAB POSSIBLY BE

01:46:36.490 --> 01:46:37.591
ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS

01:46:37.657 --> 01:46:39.326
THAT I CAN SHARE IS THAT NOT

01:46:39.392 --> 01:46:40.827
ONLY DO WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE

01:46:40.894 --> 01:46:42.929
INDICATORS THAT WERE USING WHEN

01:46:42.996 --> 01:46:45.031
WE'RE TRYING TO PREDICT SUCCESS

01:46:45.098 --> 01:46:46.366
IN ADMITTING STUDENTS.

01:46:46.433 --> 01:46:47.934
BUT WE ALSO NEED TO CONSIDER

01:46:48.001 --> 01:46:49.770
TRAINING DEVELOPMENT AS

01:46:49.836 --> 01:46:51.204
MENTIONED IN THE PREVIOUS --

01:46:51.271 --> 01:46:53.940
PANEL OF THOSE WHO ARE REVIEWING

01:46:54.007 --> 01:46:55.041
OUR STUDENTS AND THOSE WHO SERVE

01:46:55.108 --> 01:46:57.277
AS GATEKEEPERS WE NEED TO

01:46:57.344 --> 01:46:59.780
ONGOING TRAINING ON IMPLICIT

01:46:59.846 --> 01:47:02.415
BIAS ON CULTURAL COMPETENCE ON

01:47:02.482 --> 01:47:04.818
DIVERSITY ONGOING TRAINING SO

01:47:04.885 --> 01:47:07.254
THAT WE ARE AWARE THAT WHAT WHAT

01:47:07.320 --> 01:47:08.855
WE REALLY HAVE FOUND OUT IS YOU

01:47:08.922 --> 01:47:10.557
CAN'T ELIMINATE BIAS BECAUSE

01:47:10.624 --> 01:47:11.491
WE'RE HUMAN.

01:47:11.558 --> 01:47:13.760
BUT WE CAN BECOME MORE AWARE OF

01:47:13.827 --> 01:47:15.629
THE BIAS THAT EXIST WHEN WE'RE

01:47:15.695 --> 01:47:18.198
LOOKING IT AT APPLICANTS ACROSS

01:47:18.265 --> 01:47:19.766
THE RANGE AND DISTRIBUTION AND

01:47:19.833 --> 01:47:21.501
SO IN AN EFFORT NOT TO COMPOUND

01:47:21.568 --> 01:47:23.203
THESE ISSUES IT WOULD BE

01:47:23.270 --> 01:47:24.871
IMPORTANT NOT TO USE THE TOOL.

01:47:24.938 --> 01:47:28.742
BUT TO EDUCATE OUR PANELS AND

01:47:28.809 --> 01:47:30.577
REVIEWERS.

01:47:30.644 --> 01:47:31.478
L. FAT FACULTY IN HIGHER ED TO

01:47:31.545 --> 01:47:33.980
BE MORE MINDFUL OF WHAT THE WORK

01:47:34.047 --> 01:47:35.482
IS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO SO

01:47:35.549 --> 01:47:37.150
CREATING MORE ACCOUNTABILITY IN

01:47:37.217 --> 01:47:39.252
OUR INFRASTRUCTURE SO THAT WE

01:47:39.319 --> 01:47:40.720
ARE PLACING.

01:47:40.787 --> 01:47:42.355
THE BURDEN ON THOSE WHO ARE

01:47:42.422 --> 01:47:43.990
SERVING AS GATEKEEPERS TO BE

01:47:44.057 --> 01:47:47.060
MINDFUL BEYOND THE TOOLS THAT WE

01:47:47.127 --> 01:47:47.227
USE.

01:47:47.294 --> 01:47:48.795
AND I'LL STOP THERE [inaudible]

01:47:48.862 --> 01:47:51.598
THANK YOU [inaudible]

01:47:51.665 --> 01:47:53.500
DINNER.

01:47:53.567 --> 01:47:55.368
THANK YOU SO MUCH CHAIR AND

01:47:55.435 --> 01:47:56.937
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR

01:47:57.003 --> 01:47:58.572
INVITING ME HERE TODAY TO

01:47:58.638 --> 01:48:00.273
DISCUSS WITH YOU THE BAR EXAMS

01:48:00.340 --> 01:48:02.375
CUT SCORE AND IT'S

01:48:02.442 --> 01:48:03.777
DISCRIMINATORY IMPACT.

01:48:03.844 --> 01:48:05.445
I'M I'M OFTEN ASKED TO SPEAK

01:48:05.512 --> 01:48:07.080
ABOUT DIVERSITY IN THE CONTEXT

01:48:07.147 --> 01:48:08.815
OF MY WORK ACROSS THE COUNTRY ON

01:48:08.882 --> 01:48:11.384
IMPLICIT RACIAL AND GENDER BIAS

01:48:11.451 --> 01:48:13.053
AND STEREOTYPE THREAD AND RACIAL

01:48:13.119 --> 01:48:15.856
ANXIETY -- AND I MENTION THAT

01:48:15.922 --> 01:48:17.557
BECAUSE ALL OF THE RESEARCH

01:48:17.624 --> 01:48:19.793
DEMONSTRATES THAT DIVERSITY OF

01:48:19.860 --> 01:48:21.528
ALL TYPES OF RACIAL DIVERSITY

01:48:21.595 --> 01:48:23.797
AND GENDER DIVERSITY RESULTS IN

01:48:23.864 --> 01:48:25.866
MORE INNOVATION RESULTS IN MORE

01:48:25.932 --> 01:48:27.400
CREATIVITY.

01:48:27.467 --> 01:48:29.202
AND THAT IT CAN HELP PEOPLE AND

01:48:29.269 --> 01:48:32.172
SYSTEMS TO THRIVE AND THAT'S WHY

01:48:32.239 --> 01:48:34.441
DIVERSITY IS SO IMPORTANT WITHIN

01:48:34.507 --> 01:48:35.709
THE CONTEXT OF THE LEGAL

01:48:35.775 --> 01:48:37.410
PROFESSION ITSELF SO THANK YOU

01:48:37.477 --> 01:48:40.080
AGAIN FOR ALLOWING ME TO BE HERE.

01:48:40.146 --> 01:48:41.581
THE RESEARCH ALSO DEMONSTRATES

01:48:41.648 --> 01:48:43.750
THAT INDIVIDUALS THRIVE WHEN

01:48:43.817 --> 01:48:46.186
THEY HAVE A SENSE OF BELONGING

01:48:46.253 --> 01:48:48.188
WE'VE HEARD SOME OF THAT ALREADY

01:48:48.255 --> 01:48:49.289
THIS MORNING.

01:48:49.356 --> 01:48:50.991
AND WHEN THEY CAN SEE PEOPLE

01:48:51.057 --> 01:48:53.927
AROUND THEM WHO ARE LIKE THEM

01:48:53.994 --> 01:48:56.396
AND AS PEOPLE ON THAT FIRST

01:48:56.463 --> 01:48:57.998
PANEL STATED THIS MORNING THEY

01:48:58.064 --> 01:48:59.666
WEREN'T SUPPOSED TO BE WHERE

01:48:59.733 --> 01:49:00.834
THEY ARE.

01:49:00.901 --> 01:49:02.502
AND I WASN'T SUPPOSED TO BE THE

01:49:02.569 --> 01:49:04.671
D. IN OF A TOP TWENTY FIVE

01:49:04.738 --> 01:49:06.473
SCHOOL HI THERE -- MY MOTHER IS

01:49:06.539 --> 01:49:08.308
A KOREAN IMMIGRANTS MY FATHER IS

01:49:08.375 --> 01:49:09.976
AN AFRICAN AMERICAN MEMBER OF

01:49:10.043 --> 01:49:12.178
THE ARMY AND LIKE SO MANY PEOPLE

01:49:12.245 --> 01:49:14.147
OF ALREADY SHARED THIS MORNING

01:49:14.214 --> 01:49:17.284
THROUGHOUT MY ENTIRE CHILDHOOD.

01:49:17.350 --> 01:49:18.785
IF IT WEREN'T FOR MY MOM WHO

01:49:18.852 --> 01:49:21.421
WORKED AT OF ROPE FACTORY -- IN

01:49:21.488 --> 01:49:22.956
THE NIGHT SHIFT THROUGHOUT MY

01:49:23.023 --> 01:49:25.258
ENTIRE HIGH SCHOOL CAREER AND IF

01:49:25.325 --> 01:49:27.928
IT WEREN'T FOR MY FATHER ALSO

01:49:27.994 --> 01:49:30.230
PROVIDING US WITH EVERY BELIEF

01:49:30.297 --> 01:49:31.765
IN THE FACT THAT MY BROTHERS AND

01:49:31.831 --> 01:49:34.467
I COULD MAKE IT AND COULD DO IT.

01:49:34.534 --> 01:49:36.269
AND IF IT WEREN'T OR ALL OF THE

01:49:36.336 --> 01:49:38.038
PEOPLE OF COLOR THE SUCCESSFUL

01:49:38.104 --> 01:49:39.472
OF PEOPLE OF COLOR.

01:49:39.539 --> 01:49:41.508
THAT SUPPORTED ME THROUGHOUT MY

01:49:41.574 --> 01:49:44.711
ENTIRE EDUCATION AND THEN IN LAW

01:49:44.778 --> 01:49:46.112
SCHOOL ALL THE WAY TO

01:49:46.179 --> 01:49:48.315
ENCOURAGING ME. TO BECOME THE

01:49:48.381 --> 01:49:50.684
DEAN OF THIS ONE I WOULD NOT BE

01:49:50.750 --> 01:49:52.652
HERE AND I KNOW THAT IT MAKES AN

01:49:52.719 --> 01:49:54.754
INCREDIBLE DIFFERENCE TO MY

01:49:54.821 --> 01:49:56.156
STUDENTS BECAUSE THEY TELL ME

01:49:56.222 --> 01:49:57.324
ALL THE TIME.

01:49:57.390 --> 01:49:59.592
AND TO MY COLLEAGUES ACROSS THE

01:49:59.659 --> 01:50:01.861
LAW PROFESSOR PROFESSION TO SEE

01:50:01.928 --> 01:50:03.863
THE TYPE OF DIVERSITY THAT EXIST

01:50:03.930 --> 01:50:05.665
AND TO HAVE THIS SENSE OF

01:50:05.732 --> 01:50:06.766
BELONGING SO IT IS.

01:50:06.833 --> 01:50:09.169
CRITICAL AND THANK YOU SO MUCH

01:50:09.235 --> 01:50:10.770
FOR FOR HAVING THIS HEARING TO

01:50:10.837 --> 01:50:11.905
REALLY EXAMINE.

01:50:11.972 --> 01:50:13.373
THESE ISSUES.

01:50:13.440 --> 01:50:16.242
AND SO IN LIGHT OF THE CRITICAL

01:50:16.309 --> 01:50:18.211
IMPORTANCE OF DIVERSITY TO THE

01:50:18.278 --> 01:50:21.147
LEGAL PROFESSION I JUST WANT TO

01:50:21.214 --> 01:50:21.781
BE BLUNT.

01:50:21.848 --> 01:50:23.817
IF WE CARE ABOUT DIVERSITY AND

01:50:23.883 --> 01:50:25.185
INCLUSION IN THE LEGAL

01:50:25.251 --> 01:50:26.886
PROFESSION AND I WILL ASSUME

01:50:26.953 --> 01:50:28.054
THAT WE DO.

01:50:28.121 --> 01:50:30.523
THEN THE CURRENT TO BAR EXAM CUT

01:50:30.590 --> 01:50:34.294
SCORES IS SIMPLY UNCONSCIONABLE.

01:50:34.361 --> 01:50:35.962
WE HAVE THE SECOND HIGHEST CUT

01:50:36.029 --> 01:50:37.864
SCORE IN THE NATION ONLY

01:50:37.931 --> 01:50:39.733
DELAWARE IS HIGHER.

01:50:39.799 --> 01:50:43.336
NEW YORK'S CUT SCORE IS.

01:50:43.403 --> 01:50:43.937
ONE THIRTY THREE THE NATIONAL

01:50:44.004 --> 01:50:45.839
AVERAGE CUTS SCORE FOR PASSING

01:50:45.905 --> 01:50:48.775
THE BAR EXAM IS.

01:50:48.842 --> 01:50:50.176
ONE THIRTY FIVE CALIFORNIA'S CUT

01:50:50.243 --> 01:50:54.280
SCORE IS.

01:50:54.347 --> 01:50:54.848
ONE FORTY FOUR AND WE KNOW

01:50:54.914 --> 01:50:56.816
WITHOUT ANY DOUBT THAT ARE

01:50:56.883 --> 01:50:59.285
ABNORMALLY HIGH CUT SCORE HAS A

01:50:59.352 --> 01:51:01.187
DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT ON

01:51:01.254 --> 01:51:03.089
PEOPLE OF COLOR.

01:51:03.156 --> 01:51:05.492
SO IF OUR CUTS GORE HAD BEEN ONE

01:51:05.558 --> 01:51:06.626
THIRTY FIVE WHICH I MENTIONED

01:51:06.693 --> 01:51:08.528
ALREADY IS THE NATIONAL AVERAGE.

01:51:08.595 --> 01:51:11.297
THEN 43% MORE WHITES WOULD HAVE

01:51:11.364 --> 01:51:15.802
PASSED THE BAR EXAM IN JULY. 64%

01:51:15.869 --> 01:51:17.337
MORE ASIANS WOULD HAVE PASSED

01:51:17.404 --> 01:51:21.074
THE BAR EXAM 68% MORE LATIN ACTS

01:51:21.141 --> 01:51:22.575
WOULD HAVE PASSED THE BAR EXAM

01:51:22.642 --> 01:51:25.912
AND ONE HUNDRED AND 23% MORE

01:51:25.979 --> 01:51:27.447
AFRICAN AMERICANS WOULD HAVE

01:51:27.514 --> 01:51:29.816
PASSED THE JULY BAR EXAM.

01:51:29.883 --> 01:51:31.284
IF OUR CUTS SCORE WHERE THE

01:51:31.351 --> 01:51:34.954
NATIONAL AVERAGE OF ONE THIRTY

01:51:35.021 --> 01:51:35.989
FIVE AND IF THESE INDIVIDUALS

01:51:36.056 --> 01:51:38.425
HAD TAKEN THE BAR IN NEW YORK OR

01:51:38.491 --> 01:51:40.260
IN MOST OTHER STATES ACROSS THE

01:51:40.326 --> 01:51:41.561
COUNTRY.

01:51:41.628 --> 01:51:42.896
THEY WOULD BE PRACTICING LAW

01:51:42.962 --> 01:51:45.098
RIGHT NOW.

01:51:45.165 --> 01:51:47.233
INSTEAD BECAUSE OF OUR OUT LIAR

01:51:47.300 --> 01:51:49.502
CUT SCORE MANY OF OUR PROMISING

01:51:49.569 --> 01:51:51.738
AND TALENTED Là GRADUATES ARE

01:51:51.805 --> 01:51:53.306
LOSING THEIR JOBS.

01:51:53.373 --> 01:51:56.309
AND INCREASING THEIR DEBT.

01:51:56.376 --> 01:51:59.412
SO IT IS ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THAT

01:51:59.479 --> 01:52:01.514
ARE ABNORMALLY HIGH CUT SCORE

01:52:01.581 --> 01:52:03.550
ADVERSELY IMPACTS THE DIVERSITY

01:52:03.616 --> 01:52:05.218
OF THE LEGAL PROFESSION AND IF

01:52:05.285 --> 01:52:07.487
WE WERE TO REDUCE THE CUT SCORE.

01:52:07.554 --> 01:52:10.023
AT LEAST TO THE NATIONAL AVERAGE

01:52:10.090 --> 01:52:11.758
WE WOULD IMMEDIATELY ENSURE THAT

01:52:11.825 --> 01:52:13.059
THE LAWYERS ENTERING THE

01:52:13.126 --> 01:52:14.594
PROFESSION IN CALIFORNIA COME

01:52:14.661 --> 01:52:16.696
CLOSER TO REPRESENTING OUR

01:52:16.763 --> 01:52:19.199
POPULATION AND ALSO DIVERSITY OF

01:52:19.265 --> 01:52:21.000
STUDENTS WHO GRADUATE FROM OUR

01:52:21.067 --> 01:52:22.936
LAW SCHOOLS.

01:52:23.002 --> 01:52:24.404
SO WHAT THEN IS THE

01:52:24.471 --> 01:52:27.207
JUSTIFICATION FOR FAILING TO

01:52:27.273 --> 01:52:28.875
REDUCE OUR CUT SCORE.

01:52:28.942 --> 01:52:30.143
YOU WOULD IMAGINE THAT THE

01:52:30.210 --> 01:52:31.644
JUSTIFICATION WOULD BE A

01:52:31.711 --> 01:52:34.114
COMPELLING ONE GIVEN WHAT WE

01:52:34.180 --> 01:52:36.149
KNOW IS THE ADVERSE IMPACT ON

01:52:36.216 --> 01:52:37.217
THE DIVERSITY OF THE LEGAL

01:52:37.283 --> 01:52:38.818
PROFESSION BUT THE ONLY

01:52:38.885 --> 01:52:39.919
JUSTIFICATION.

01:52:39.986 --> 01:52:42.288
THAT HAS BEEN GIVEN FOR KEEPING

01:52:42.355 --> 01:52:45.358
OUR CUTS SCORE ABNORMALLY HIGH

01:52:45.425 --> 01:52:45.658
[inaudible]

01:52:45.725 --> 01:52:47.861
IS TRADITION.

01:52:47.927 --> 01:52:49.796
SO AGAIN TO BE BLUNT IT IS

01:52:49.863 --> 01:52:52.665
SHAMEFUL IN MY OPINION TO RETAIN

01:52:52.732 --> 01:52:54.934
A CUT SCORE BASED SOLELY ON

01:52:55.001 --> 01:52:56.836
TRADITION WHEN WE KNOW THAT A

01:52:56.903 --> 01:52:58.404
DRAMATICALLY LIMITS THE

01:52:58.471 --> 01:52:59.205
DIVERSITY OF THE LEGAL

01:52:59.272 --> 01:53:00.006
PROFESSION.

01:53:00.073 --> 01:53:01.674
IN CALIFORNIA.

01:53:01.741 --> 01:53:03.776
SO LET'S CONTINUE TO STUDY THE

01:53:03.843 --> 01:53:05.845
PROBLEM AS THE BAR SUGGEST THAT

01:53:05.912 --> 01:53:06.980
WE SHOULD.

01:53:07.046 --> 01:53:09.482
BUT LET'S REDUCE THE CUT SCORE

01:53:09.549 --> 01:53:10.783
WHILE WE DO SO.

01:53:10.850 --> 01:53:12.986
BECAUSE THE DIVERSITY OF THE

01:53:13.052 --> 01:53:14.854
LEGAL PROFESSION IN CALIFORNIA

01:53:14.921 --> 01:53:17.490
THAT WE SAY THAT WE CARE ABOUT.

01:53:17.557 --> 01:53:18.825
DEPENDS UPON IT.

01:53:18.892 --> 01:53:20.560
THANK YOU SO MUCH [inaudible]

01:53:20.627 --> 01:53:23.029
THANK YOU.

01:53:23.096 --> 01:53:24.597
JUSTICE LIEU.

01:53:24.664 --> 01:53:26.366
WELCOME THANK YOU -- THANK YOU

01:53:26.432 --> 01:53:28.501
CHAIRMAN STONE AND MEMBERS AND

01:53:28.568 --> 01:53:30.470
STAFF OF THE COMMITTEE -- I'M

01:53:30.537 --> 01:53:32.205
VERY DELIGHTED.

01:53:32.272 --> 01:53:33.306
TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS IMPORTANT

01:53:33.373 --> 01:53:34.641
HEARING I'M GRATEFUL TO ALL OF

01:53:34.707 --> 01:53:36.809
YOU FOR HIGHLIGHTING THIS --

01:53:36.876 --> 01:53:40.613
THIS ISSUE -- CHAIRMAN STONE

01:53:40.680 --> 01:53:42.815
LIKE MANY CALIFORNIANS I GREW UP.

01:53:42.882 --> 01:53:44.784
IN AN IMMIGRANT FAMILY IN FACT

01:53:44.851 --> 01:53:46.319
RIGHT HERE IN SACRAMENTO.

01:53:46.386 --> 01:53:48.421
THIS IS MY HOMETOWN AND COMING

01:53:48.488 --> 01:53:50.056
BACK HERE TODAY.

01:53:50.123 --> 01:53:52.158
REMINDS ME OF THE VERY FIRST

01:53:52.225 --> 01:53:54.027
LAWYER I'VE EVER MET.

01:53:54.093 --> 01:53:56.095
HIS NAME WAS BOB MATSUI.

01:53:56.162 --> 01:53:57.897
AND HE WAS MY CONGRESSMAN AT A

01:53:57.964 --> 01:53:59.065
TIME WHEN.

01:53:59.132 --> 01:54:00.833
THE FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE

01:54:00.900 --> 01:54:01.367
MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF

01:54:01.434 --> 01:54:03.069
REPRESENTATIVES INCLUDED JUST

01:54:03.136 --> 01:54:05.538
THREE ASIAN AMERICANS.

01:54:05.605 --> 01:54:07.273
WHEN I WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL

01:54:07.340 --> 01:54:09.576
BOB SPONSORED ME TO BE A PAGE IN

01:54:09.642 --> 01:54:10.777
THE?

01:54:10.843 --> 01:54:12.478
US CONGRESS BACK WHEN THERE WERE

01:54:12.545 --> 01:54:13.813
SUCH THINGS.

01:54:13.880 --> 01:54:15.248
AND FROM HIS MENTORSHIP AN

01:54:15.315 --> 01:54:18.218
EXAMPLE I CAME TO REALIZE THAT A

01:54:18.284 --> 01:54:20.687
PERSON LIKE ME COULD GROW UP TO

01:54:20.753 --> 01:54:22.455
BE A PERSON LIKE HIM.

01:54:22.522 --> 01:54:23.556
AND WHEN I THINK ABOUT WHY

01:54:23.623 --> 01:54:25.458
DIVERSITY MATTERS IN THE LEGAL

01:54:25.525 --> 01:54:28.061
PROFESSION -- I THINK ABOUT THE

01:54:28.127 --> 01:54:30.196
DIFFERENCE BOB MADE IN MY LIFE.

01:54:30.263 --> 01:54:31.231
I ALSO THINK ABOUT THE

01:54:31.297 --> 01:54:32.365
DIFFERENCE THAT A MORE INCLUSIVE

01:54:32.432 --> 01:54:33.466
LEGAL PROFESSION MIGHT OF MADE

01:54:33.533 --> 01:54:35.501
IN BOB'S LIFE.

01:54:35.568 --> 01:54:37.503
YOU SEE IN NINETEEN FORTY TWO

01:54:37.570 --> 01:54:39.105
WHEN BOB WAS SIX MONTHS OLD.

01:54:39.172 --> 01:54:40.640
HE AND HIS FAMILY WERE FORCIBLY

01:54:40.707 --> 01:54:41.975
RELOCATED FROM THEIR HOME IN

01:54:42.041 --> 01:54:44.310
SACRAMENTO TO THE INTERNMENT

01:54:44.377 --> 01:54:44.510
CAMP.

01:54:44.577 --> 01:54:45.912
AT TO A LAKE.

01:54:45.979 --> 01:54:47.480
AND THIS STAIN ON OUR NATIONAL

01:54:47.547 --> 01:54:49.215
HISTORY HAS MANY CAUSES BUT IS

01:54:49.282 --> 01:54:50.850
WORTH ASKING I THINK.

01:54:50.917 --> 01:54:52.552
WHETHER COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED

01:54:52.619 --> 01:54:54.020
IF MORE PEOPLE LIKE BOB MATSUI

01:54:54.087 --> 01:54:56.990
HAD OCCUPIED THE TOP ECHELONS.

01:54:57.056 --> 01:54:58.491
OF GOVERNMENT AT THE TIME.

01:54:58.558 --> 01:54:59.759
AND THE FACT THAT BOB'S NAME NOW

01:54:59.826 --> 01:55:01.694
GRACES THE FEDERAL COURTHOUSE

01:55:01.761 --> 01:55:03.296
JUST THREE BLOCKS FROM HERE.

01:55:03.363 --> 01:55:04.364
IS A POIGNANT REMINDER OF THIS

01:55:04.430 --> 01:55:07.133
LEGACY.

01:55:07.200 --> 01:55:07.667
THE ISSUE OF DIVERSITY HAS

01:55:07.734 --> 01:55:09.702
ALWAYS BEEN DEEPLY PERSONAL TO

01:55:09.769 --> 01:55:12.605
ME AND NEVER MORE SO THAN NOW.

01:55:12.672 --> 01:55:13.506
WHEN I WAS APPOINTED TO THE

01:55:13.573 --> 01:55:16.509
CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT IN?

01:55:16.576 --> 01:55:17.076
TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN I DO NOT

01:55:17.143 --> 01:55:18.745
FULLY APPRECIATE HOW UNCOMMON IT

01:55:18.811 --> 01:55:21.047
WAS. FOR AN ASIAN AMERICAN TO BE

01:55:21.114 --> 01:55:22.248
A JUDGE.

01:55:22.315 --> 01:55:23.816
AMONG NEARLY SEVENTEEN HUNDRED

01:55:23.883 --> 01:55:25.385
JUDGES IN CALIFORNIA LESS THAN

01:55:25.451 --> 01:55:27.954
6% WERE ASIAN AMERICAN AT A TIME.

01:55:28.021 --> 01:55:29.689
WHEN ASIAN AMERICANS WERE OVER

01:55:29.756 --> 01:55:31.658
13% OF THE STATE POPULATION

01:55:31.724 --> 01:55:32.592
TODAY?

01:55:32.659 --> 01:55:34.294
NEARLY 8% OF CALIFORNIA JUDGES

01:55:34.360 --> 01:55:36.929
ARE ASIAN AMERICAN COMPARED 215%

01:55:36.996 --> 01:55:38.298
OF THE STATE'S POPULATION.

01:55:38.364 --> 01:55:40.099
LESS THAN 11% OF OUR JUDGES ARE

01:55:40.166 --> 01:55:41.200
LATINO.

01:55:41.267 --> 01:55:43.202
COMPARED 214% OF THE STATE

01:55:43.269 --> 01:55:44.671
POPULATION THESE NUMBERS.

01:55:44.737 --> 01:55:46.272
ACTUALLY REFLECTS SIGNIFICANT

01:55:46.339 --> 01:55:48.041
PROGRESS SINCE I JOIN THE BENCH.

01:55:48.107 --> 01:55:48.675
BUT THEY'RE STILL A LONG WAY TO

01:55:48.741 --> 01:55:50.643
GO.

01:55:50.710 --> 01:55:52.278
THE MOST LIKELY PATHWAYS TO THE

01:55:52.345 --> 01:55:54.280
BENCH REMAIN AN OBSTACLE COURSE

01:55:54.347 --> 01:55:56.482
FOR MANY GROUPS [inaudible]

01:55:56.549 --> 01:55:58.518
CONSIDER PROSECUTORS.

01:55:58.584 --> 01:55:59.819
A STUDY BY STANFORD LAW SCHOOL

01:55:59.886 --> 01:56:01.988
FOUND THAT AMONG CALIFORNIA

01:56:02.055 --> 01:56:03.323
PROSECUTORS IN SUPERVISORY

01:56:03.389 --> 01:56:06.192
POSITIONS IN.

01:56:06.259 --> 01:56:06.793
TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN ONLY 9%

01:56:06.859 --> 01:56:08.861
WERE ASIAN TEN POINT 8% WERE

01:56:08.928 --> 01:56:12.565
LATINO SIX POINT 6% WERE BLACK.

01:56:12.632 --> 01:56:15.168
73% OF THE SUPERVISORS IN DA

01:56:15.234 --> 01:56:16.803
OFFICES THROUGHOUT THE STATE

01:56:16.869 --> 01:56:17.970
WERE WHITE.

01:56:18.037 --> 01:56:19.972
IN A STATE WAS POPULATION IS

01:56:20.039 --> 01:56:21.407
LESS THAN 40%.

01:56:21.474 --> 01:56:23.309
WHITE.

01:56:23.376 --> 01:56:24.844
CONSIDER LAW FIRMS YOU SAW SOME

01:56:24.911 --> 01:56:26.312
OF THE DATA EARLIER.

01:56:26.379 --> 01:56:28.881
A TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN SURVEY OF

01:56:28.948 --> 01:56:29.482
TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MAJOR

01:56:29.549 --> 01:56:31.017
FIRMS BY VAULT IN THE MINORITY

01:56:31.084 --> 01:56:32.819
CORPORATE COUNSEL ASSOCIATION.

01:56:32.885 --> 01:56:34.020
REPORTED.

01:56:34.087 --> 01:56:36.789
THAT 92% OF EQUITY PARTNERS WERE

01:56:36.856 --> 01:56:39.125
WHITE AS WERE 89% OF NOT EQUITY

01:56:39.192 --> 01:56:41.027
PARTNERS.

01:56:41.094 --> 01:56:42.562
ATTRITION RATES AMONG ASIAN

01:56:42.628 --> 01:56:44.297
BLACK AND LATINO ASSOCIATES ARE

01:56:44.364 --> 01:56:45.131
MUCH HIGHER THAN THOSE AMONG

01:56:45.198 --> 01:56:46.699
WHITES.

01:56:46.766 --> 01:56:48.568
NOTABLY FORTUNATELY SOME OF THE

01:56:48.634 --> 01:56:50.403
FIRM'S DEMONSTRATING LEADERSHIP

01:56:50.470 --> 01:56:51.637
ON DIVERSITY ARE RIGHT HERE IN

01:56:51.704 --> 01:56:54.374
CALIFORNIA. FOR EXAMPLE ONE OF

01:56:54.440 --> 01:56:56.676
YOUR NEXT PANELISTS HAILING CHEN

01:56:56.743 --> 01:56:58.344
WAS RECENTLY APPOINTED THE CO

01:56:58.411 --> 01:56:59.679
MANAGING PARTNER OF MUNGER

01:56:59.746 --> 01:57:01.080
TOLLES OLSEN.

01:57:01.147 --> 01:57:02.515
BUT WE NEED A LOT MORE HAILING

01:57:02.582 --> 01:57:04.217
CHANCE IN THE PIPELINE FOR

01:57:04.283 --> 01:57:07.220
ADVANCEMENT IN OUR PROFESSION.

01:57:07.286 --> 01:57:08.721
OR CONSIDER JUDICIAL CLERKSHIPS

01:57:08.788 --> 01:57:10.089
WHICH IS AN EARLY PRESTIGE

01:57:10.156 --> 01:57:12.225
MARKER AFTER LAW SCHOOL THE DATA

01:57:12.291 --> 01:57:13.593
FROM THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION

01:57:13.659 --> 01:57:15.094
FOR LAW PLACEMENT SHOW.

01:57:15.161 --> 01:57:16.729
THAT ASIAN BLACKS LATINOS

01:57:16.796 --> 01:57:19.499
COMPRISED 14% OF FEDERAL LAW

01:57:19.565 --> 01:57:21.234
CLERKS IN.

01:57:21.300 --> 01:57:21.868
TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN EVEN THOUGH

01:57:21.934 --> 01:57:23.403
THEY MADE UP 23% OF THE

01:57:23.469 --> 01:57:24.570
GRADUATES FROM THE TOP THIRTY

01:57:24.637 --> 01:57:26.406
LAW SCHOOLS.

01:57:26.472 --> 01:57:27.673
THIS DISPARITIES TROUBLING

01:57:27.740 --> 01:57:29.142
BECAUSE A JUDICIAL CLERKSHIP IS

01:57:29.208 --> 01:57:31.477
OFTEN EXPERIENCE THAT STIMULATES

01:57:31.544 --> 01:57:34.414
INTEREST IN BECOMING A JUDGE.

01:57:34.480 --> 01:57:36.015
IN A RECENT MEDIA INTERVIEW I

01:57:36.082 --> 01:57:37.817
WAS ASKED TO REFLECT ON MY OWN

01:57:37.884 --> 01:57:38.951
PATH TO THE BENCH.

01:57:39.018 --> 01:57:40.453
I SAID THAT MUCH OF MY PATH

01:57:40.520 --> 01:57:41.387
AROSE.

01:57:41.454 --> 01:57:43.055
FROM SHEER LUCK.

01:57:43.122 --> 01:57:44.891
LUCK THAT I FOUND CERTAIN

01:57:44.957 --> 01:57:46.959
MENTORS LOCK THAT SOME OF THOSE

01:57:47.026 --> 01:57:48.327
MENTORS INTERVENED AT CRUCIAL

01:57:48.394 --> 01:57:49.429
MOMENTS.

01:57:49.495 --> 01:57:51.030
AND OTHERS WERE WILLING TO TAKE

01:57:51.097 --> 01:57:52.298
A CHANCE ON ME.

01:57:52.365 --> 01:57:54.467
AND I SAID FOR EVERYONE OF ME

01:57:54.534 --> 01:57:55.902
WHO HAS HAD GOOD FORTUNE THERE

01:57:55.968 --> 01:57:57.136
ARE OTHERS.

01:57:57.203 --> 01:57:58.504
WHO ARE TRYING TO NAVIGATE THEIR

01:57:58.571 --> 01:57:59.739
CAREERS ON THEIR OWN?

01:57:59.806 --> 01:58:02.141
OR FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS.

01:58:02.208 --> 01:58:03.276
YOU KNOW I'M REMINDED OF THE OLD

01:58:03.342 --> 01:58:04.710
ADAGE.

01:58:04.777 --> 01:58:06.112
THAT OPPORTUNITY IS WHERE LUCK

01:58:06.179 --> 01:58:07.914
MEETS PREPARATION.

01:58:07.980 --> 01:58:10.149
MUCH OF WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS TO

01:58:10.216 --> 01:58:12.051
REDUCE THE ELEMENT OF LOCK.

01:58:12.118 --> 01:58:14.187
SO THAT PREPARATION IS THE MAIN

01:58:14.253 --> 01:58:16.355
GATEWAY TO OPPORTUNITY.

01:58:16.422 --> 01:58:17.490
IN A TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN

01:58:17.557 --> 01:58:18.991
STUDY THAT I CO AUTHORED WITH

01:58:19.058 --> 01:58:20.226
SEVERAL YELLOW STUDENTS.

01:58:20.293 --> 01:58:22.228
WE SURVEYED OVER SIX HUNDRED

01:58:22.295 --> 01:58:23.563
ASIAN AMERICAN LAWYERS AND ASKED

01:58:23.629 --> 01:58:25.231
WHAT OBSTACLES TO ADVANCEMENT

01:58:25.298 --> 01:58:26.666
THEY EXPERIENCE.

01:58:26.732 --> 01:58:29.001
THE MOST COMMON ANSWER WAS

01:58:29.068 --> 01:58:30.603
INADEQUATE ACCESS TO MENTORS AND

01:58:30.670 --> 01:58:32.538
CONTACTS.

01:58:32.605 --> 01:58:34.574
IN MANY WORKPLACES ACCESS TO

01:58:34.640 --> 01:58:35.842
IMPORTANT RELATIONSHIPS IN

01:58:35.908 --> 01:58:36.843
NETWORKS.

01:58:36.909 --> 01:58:39.378
IS THE TOUGHEST NUT TO CRACK.

01:58:39.445 --> 01:58:41.113
BUT THIS CANNOT BE LEFT TO LUCK.

01:58:41.180 --> 01:58:42.415
IF WE WANT DIVERSITY AT THE TOP

01:58:42.482 --> 01:58:43.983
OF OUR PROFESSION.

01:58:44.050 --> 01:58:45.551
WE HAVE TO MAKE INCLUSION AND

01:58:45.618 --> 01:58:47.720
INTENTIONAL AND SYSTEMATIC PART

01:58:47.787 --> 01:58:49.722
OF WORKPLACE POLICIES AND REWARD

01:58:49.789 --> 01:58:52.525
STRUCTURES IT MUST BE BAKED INTO

01:58:52.592 --> 01:58:54.427
THE WAY WE DEVELOP TALENT.

01:58:54.494 --> 01:58:56.963
AND FACILITATE ADVANCEMENT.

01:58:57.029 --> 01:58:58.264
SO CLOSE I JUST WANT TO COMMEND

01:58:58.331 --> 01:58:59.398
THIS COMMITTEE FOR SHINING A

01:58:59.465 --> 01:59:01.901
SPOTLIGHT ON THIS ISSUE WE NEED

01:59:01.968 --> 01:59:02.568
TO DISCUSS IT WE NEED TO MONITOR

01:59:02.635 --> 01:59:03.336
IT.

01:59:03.402 --> 01:59:04.971
AND WE NEED TO KEEP MEASURING

01:59:05.037 --> 01:59:07.106
PROGRESS BECAUSE WHAT GETS

01:59:07.173 --> 01:59:09.141
MEASURED GETS MANAGED.

01:59:09.208 --> 01:59:10.810
TRANSPARENCY AND AWARENESS ARE

01:59:10.877 --> 01:59:12.545
THE PREREQUISITES FOR DEVELOPING

01:59:12.612 --> 01:59:14.780
SOLUTIONS AND MOTIVATING ACTION.

01:59:14.847 --> 01:59:16.549
SO MY HOPE IS THAT THIS HEARING

01:59:16.616 --> 01:59:18.117
WILL BE THE FIRST OF MANY

01:59:18.184 --> 01:59:19.819
PERHAPS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS.

01:59:19.886 --> 01:59:22.054
THAT BRINGS SUSTAINED ATTENTION

01:59:22.121 --> 01:59:23.756
TO AN ISSUE THAT IS VITAL TO THE

01:59:23.823 --> 01:59:25.858
EFFICACY OUR PROFESSION.

01:59:25.925 --> 01:59:27.059
AND TO THE WELL BEING OF OUR

01:59:27.126 --> 01:59:28.628
SOCIETY AS A WHOLE.

01:59:28.694 --> 01:59:29.695
THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THIS

01:59:29.762 --> 01:59:30.830
OPPORTUNITY AND BE PLEASED TO

01:59:30.897 --> 01:59:32.131
ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT.

01:59:32.198 --> 01:59:33.432
THANK YOU JUST AS A THANK YOU

01:59:33.499 --> 01:59:36.569
VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US.

01:59:36.636 --> 01:59:38.504
SEVERAL TIMES THIS NOTION OR

01:59:38.571 --> 01:59:39.739
THIS STATEMENT I'M NOT SUPPOSED

01:59:39.805 --> 01:59:42.341
TO BE HERE.

01:59:42.408 --> 01:59:44.243
AND AND THAT'S JUST FRUSTRATE

01:59:44.310 --> 01:59:45.878
TRUE AND I KNOW HOW WE GET THERE

01:59:45.945 --> 01:59:47.280
BUT HOW DO WE GET TO THE POINT

01:59:47.346 --> 01:59:49.248
WHERE [inaudible]

01:59:49.315 --> 01:59:52.184
THAT'S NOT.

01:59:52.251 --> 01:59:53.519
WHAT WE'RE HEARING FROM PEOPLE

01:59:53.586 --> 01:59:56.622
ANYMORE AND THIS NOTION OF LOCK

01:59:56.689 --> 01:59:58.524
AND OPPORTUNITY?

01:59:58.591 --> 01:59:59.892
COMING TOGETHER OR LIKE IN

01:59:59.959 --> 02:00:01.627
PREPARATION COMING TOGETHER THAT

02:00:01.694 --> 02:00:02.762
CREATES AN OPPORTUNITY I THINK

02:00:02.828 --> 02:00:04.230
THAT'S GENERALLY TRUE BUT AS

02:00:04.297 --> 02:00:05.898
WE'VE HEARD.

02:00:05.965 --> 02:00:07.166
THERE ARE GATEKEEPERS ALONG THE

02:00:07.233 --> 02:00:08.501
WAY AND THEIR GATES ALONG THE

02:00:08.568 --> 02:00:09.769
WAY.

02:00:09.835 --> 02:00:13.005
THAT INORDINATELY THE INFLUENCE

02:00:13.072 --> 02:00:13.306
[inaudible]

02:00:13.372 --> 02:00:14.807
THAT.

02:00:14.874 --> 02:00:17.009
OPPORTUNITY THE REGARDLESS OF

02:00:17.076 --> 02:00:18.678
PREPARATION AND REGARDLESS OF

02:00:18.744 --> 02:00:20.479
LOCK THAT ESSENTIALLY TAKE

02:00:20.546 --> 02:00:22.582
LOCKED OUT OF THE EQUATION.

02:00:22.648 --> 02:00:24.317
IS WHAT IT SEEMS AND SO THAT

02:00:24.383 --> 02:00:26.485
THAT THAT THAT GATE IS IS

02:00:26.552 --> 02:00:28.287
ALLOWING SOME THROUGH IT AND NOT

02:00:28.354 --> 02:00:30.523
ALLOWING OTHERS THROUGH.

02:00:30.590 --> 02:00:31.991
REALLY BASED ON PREPARATION.

02:00:32.058 --> 02:00:33.793
SO I WAS I WAS GONNA ASK A

02:00:33.859 --> 02:00:35.294
LOADED QUESTION BUT I JUST CAN'T.

02:00:35.361 --> 02:00:36.529
BECAUSE IT'S ONE IT'S A QUESTION

02:00:36.596 --> 02:00:38.064
THAT COMES UP THAT THAT THAT

02:00:38.130 --> 02:00:39.665
MAKES ME CRAZY AND THAT'S THIS

02:00:39.732 --> 02:00:41.200
NOTION THAT IF WE DROP THE CUT

02:00:41.267 --> 02:00:42.401
SCORE.

02:00:42.468 --> 02:00:44.537
IF WE ADDRESS THE LSAT IF WE

02:00:44.604 --> 02:00:46.706
ADDRESS THE GRE.

02:00:46.772 --> 02:00:48.908
ART WE DUMBING DOWN [inaudible]

02:00:48.975 --> 02:00:50.610
THOSE EXAMS [inaudible]

02:00:50.676 --> 02:00:52.411
WHEN?

02:00:52.478 --> 02:00:53.946
WHICH IS FRUSTRATING VERY

02:00:54.013 --> 02:00:55.548
FRUSTRATING BECAUSE WHEN YOU

02:00:55.615 --> 02:00:57.016
LOOK AT THE LACK OF OPPORTUNITY

02:00:57.083 --> 02:00:59.685
IN THE PIPELINE FOR UNDERSERVED

02:00:59.752 --> 02:01:01.153
COMMUNITIES COMMUNITIES OF COLOR

02:01:01.220 --> 02:01:02.121
BECAUSE OF EDUCATIONAL

02:01:02.188 --> 02:01:03.255
OPPORTUNITIES.

02:01:03.322 --> 02:01:05.224
IT'S NOT A MATTER OF DUMBING

02:01:05.291 --> 02:01:07.393
DOWN IT'S A MATTER OF REMOVING

02:01:07.460 --> 02:01:10.029
AN UNNECESSARY BARRIERS.

02:01:10.096 --> 02:01:11.364
SO THAT WE CAN GET MORE

02:01:11.430 --> 02:01:12.999
QUALIFIED ATTORNEYS INTO THE

02:01:13.065 --> 02:01:14.433
PROFESSION.

02:01:14.500 --> 02:01:16.936
WELL FIRST OF ALL.

02:01:17.003 --> 02:01:19.205
STUDENTS AT THE LAW SCHOOL.

02:01:19.271 --> 02:01:20.506
THEN ATTORNEYS IN THE PROFESSION

02:01:20.573 --> 02:01:22.208
AND THEN.

02:01:22.274 --> 02:01:23.576
ATTORNEYS.

02:01:23.643 --> 02:01:25.478
REPRESENTING DIVERSITY ON TO THE

02:01:25.544 --> 02:01:27.313
BATCH SO HOW DO I KNOW YOU

02:01:27.380 --> 02:01:28.914
ADDRESS THAT BUT BUT HOW DO WE

02:01:28.981 --> 02:01:31.417
ADDRESS THAT ISSUE THAT KEEPS

02:01:31.484 --> 02:01:33.252
COMING UP ABOUT.

02:01:33.319 --> 02:01:36.055
DUMBING DOWN AN EXAM SO WHERE.

02:01:36.122 --> 02:01:37.323
IT ALMOST SEEMS LIKE WERE

02:01:37.390 --> 02:01:38.591
ARTIFICIALLY THEN GIVING

02:01:38.658 --> 02:01:39.792
OPPORTUNITIES WERE UP TO OUR

02:01:39.859 --> 02:01:40.893
PLEASE DON'T DON'T.

02:01:40.960 --> 02:01:43.462
LIE AND I HATE ARTICULATED THAT

02:01:43.529 --> 02:01:44.830
BECAUSE I KNOW THAT'S NOT TRUE

02:01:44.897 --> 02:01:47.333
HOW DO WE COMBAT THAT NOTION HOW

02:01:47.400 --> 02:01:49.068
DO WE MAKE IT VERY CLEAR.

02:01:49.135 --> 02:01:51.003
THAT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS

02:01:51.070 --> 02:01:52.338
MAKE SURE.

02:01:52.405 --> 02:01:54.273
THAT WE GET THE BEST QUALIFIED

02:01:54.340 --> 02:01:56.409
PEOPLE INTO THE PROFESSION ON

02:01:56.475 --> 02:01:59.378
THE BENCH.

02:01:59.445 --> 02:02:00.813
WELL I THINK YOU CHAIR THAT YOU

02:02:00.880 --> 02:02:02.648
ASK THE QUESTION AND THEN YOU

02:02:02.715 --> 02:02:04.450
YOU ANSWERED IT.

02:02:04.517 --> 02:02:07.453
TOO BUT BUT I'LL JUST ADD.

02:02:07.520 --> 02:02:10.322
A FEW MORE POINTS AT THE TO THAT

02:02:10.389 --> 02:02:13.225
FIRST TO SAY THAT WE FIRST AND

02:02:13.292 --> 02:02:17.029
PRIMARILY THE BAR EXAM ITSELF WE

02:02:17.096 --> 02:02:18.097
KNOW HAS BEEN OPERATING AS A

02:02:18.164 --> 02:02:21.200
BEAR YEAR. TO ENTRY.

02:02:21.267 --> 02:02:24.403
MOST PEOPLE MOST STUDENTS PASS

02:02:24.470 --> 02:02:26.439
THAT BAR EXAM.

02:02:26.505 --> 02:02:29.275
IN THEIR SECOND OR THIRD TIME.

02:02:29.341 --> 02:02:30.643
AND SO WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE

02:02:30.710 --> 02:02:32.745
BETWEEN NOT PASSING IT THE FIRST

02:02:32.812 --> 02:02:34.346
TIME IN PASSING AT THE SECOND OR

02:02:34.413 --> 02:02:35.448
THIRD TIME IT'S JUST GETTING

02:02:35.514 --> 02:02:37.650
BETTER AT MEMORIZATION.

02:02:37.717 --> 02:02:39.852
RIGHT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH HOW

02:02:39.919 --> 02:02:41.587
COMPETENT YOU ARE AS A LAWYER

02:02:41.654 --> 02:02:43.155
AND LESS WHAT WE ARE SAYING.

02:02:43.222 --> 02:02:44.557
IS THAT MOST STATES ACROSS THE

02:02:44.623 --> 02:02:46.659
COUNTRY INCLUDING NEW YORK THAT

02:02:46.726 --> 02:02:48.894
WE OFTEN COMPARE OURSELVES -- TO

02:02:48.961 --> 02:02:50.963
THAT NEW YORK HAS LAWYERS WHO

02:02:51.030 --> 02:02:53.265
ARE INCOMPETENT THERE ARE NO

02:02:53.332 --> 02:02:55.334
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE TO

02:02:55.401 --> 02:02:57.670
DEMONSTRATE THAT AT ALL IN ARE

02:02:57.737 --> 02:02:59.371
WE SAYING THAT DELAWARE LAWYERS

02:02:59.438 --> 02:03:01.040
THEN ARE FAR BETTER THAN

02:03:01.107 --> 02:03:02.575
CALIFORNIA LAWYERS BECAUSE THEY

02:03:02.641 --> 02:03:03.976
ARE CUT SCORE.

02:03:04.043 --> 02:03:05.111
IS HIGHER.

02:03:05.177 --> 02:03:07.646
THERE HAS BEEN NO EVIDENCE AT

02:03:07.713 --> 02:03:09.648
ALL THAT THE CUT SCORE THAT WE

02:03:09.715 --> 02:03:12.017
HAVE ON OUR CURRENT BAR EXAM

02:03:12.084 --> 02:03:12.218
SAYS.

02:03:12.284 --> 02:03:14.019
ANYTHING.

02:03:14.086 --> 02:03:15.888
ABOUT THE INTELLECT OR THE

02:03:15.955 --> 02:03:18.124
COMPETENCE OF THE LAWYER'S HERE

02:03:18.190 --> 02:03:22.294
IT IS SIMPLY ACTING AS A BARRIER

02:03:22.361 --> 02:03:23.395
TO ENTRY.

02:03:23.462 --> 02:03:25.865
OTHERWISE HOW DO WE EXPLAIN THE

02:03:25.931 --> 02:03:28.868
STUDENTS TO PASS THEIR SECOND OR

02:03:28.934 --> 02:03:30.603
THIRD TIME HAVE THEY BECOME

02:03:30.669 --> 02:03:31.804
SMARTER.

02:03:31.871 --> 02:03:34.373
IN THOSE SIX MONTHS TO A YEAR OR

02:03:34.440 --> 02:03:36.108
TWO NO THEY HAVE JUST GOTTEN

02:03:36.175 --> 02:03:37.176
BETTER.

02:03:37.243 --> 02:03:38.611
AT MEMBERS ATION.

02:03:38.677 --> 02:03:40.279
SO I EIGHT CHALLENGE I THINK

02:03:40.346 --> 02:03:41.714
SOMEONE ELSE SAID BEFORE I THINK

02:03:41.781 --> 02:03:45.951
IT WAS -- ASSEMBLYMAN CHU WHO

02:03:46.018 --> 02:03:48.487
SAID THE BURDEN OF PROOF.

02:03:48.554 --> 02:03:51.323
RESTS ON THOSE WHO WOULD KEEP

02:03:51.390 --> 02:03:54.393
THE CURRENT CUT SCORE AND SO FAR

02:03:54.460 --> 02:03:56.162
I THINK THE ONLY EXPLANATION

02:03:56.228 --> 02:03:57.663
THAT HAS BEEN GIVEN IS THAT

02:03:57.730 --> 02:03:59.965
TRADITION IS WHY WE'VE KEPT THAT

02:04:00.032 --> 02:04:01.267
SCORE AND SO WE CARE ABOUT

02:04:01.333 --> 02:04:02.802
DIVERSITY.

02:04:02.868 --> 02:04:03.969
AND AND WHERE THE LOTS OF

02:04:04.036 --> 02:04:05.571
DIVERSE LAWYERS HERE AND BY THE

02:04:05.638 --> 02:04:08.674
WAY -- I CAME HERE FROM NEW YORK

02:04:08.741 --> 02:04:10.209
AND WASHINGTON STATE I TOOK BOTH

02:04:10.276 --> 02:04:11.477
OF THOSE BAR EXAMS AND THEN I

02:04:11.544 --> 02:04:13.045
TOOK CALIFORNIA BUT I DON'T

02:04:13.112 --> 02:04:14.880
THINK THAT I'M A SMARTER OR MORE

02:04:14.947 --> 02:04:16.148
COMPETENT LAWYER.

02:04:16.215 --> 02:04:17.550
BECAUSE I TOOK THE THREE DAY

02:04:17.616 --> 02:04:19.685
CALIFORNIA BAR EXAM THAN I WAS

02:04:19.752 --> 02:04:22.087
WHEN I TOOK THE WASHINGTON STATE

02:04:22.154 --> 02:04:23.622
AND THE NEW YORK BAR EXAM.

02:04:23.689 --> 02:04:25.024
IT IN FOR THE PROFESSION OR FOR

02:04:25.090 --> 02:04:26.926
THE EDUCATIONAL PROFESSORS HERE

02:04:26.992 --> 02:04:28.694
AS WELL INTERESTING THAT YOU'RE

02:04:28.761 --> 02:04:30.796
SEEING THAT SAME PHENOMENON IT

02:04:30.863 --> 02:04:32.631
IN THE GRE.

02:04:32.698 --> 02:04:35.734
AND PERCENT OF THE THE THE LSAT.

02:04:35.801 --> 02:04:38.838
SO IS THIS.

02:04:38.904 --> 02:04:41.040
WHAT DOES THAT SAY FOR HOW WE'VE

02:04:41.106 --> 02:04:42.107
USED?

02:04:42.174 --> 02:04:43.342
TESTING IN THE STATE OF

02:04:43.409 --> 02:04:44.810
CALIFORNIA.

02:04:44.877 --> 02:04:49.415
OVER THE LAST NUMBER OF DECADES.

02:04:49.481 --> 02:04:51.517
I THINK WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS

02:04:51.584 --> 02:04:53.385
THAT WE'VE HAD IN.

02:04:53.452 --> 02:04:55.054
WE'VE HAD AN ARTIFICIAL OVER

02:04:55.120 --> 02:04:57.456
RELIANCE ON A SCHOOL BOARD THAT

02:04:57.523 --> 02:04:59.491
WE HAVE PRESUMED IN PREVIOUS

02:04:59.558 --> 02:05:02.194
YEARS WAS PREDICTING SUCCESS ARE.

02:05:02.261 --> 02:05:05.097
I KNOW WITHIN HIGHER ED FACULTY

02:05:05.164 --> 02:05:07.233
SOMETIMES LOOK AT HIGHER JUROR

02:05:07.299 --> 02:05:10.769
YOU SCORES AND MISTAKENLY ASSUME

02:05:10.836 --> 02:05:12.471
THAT STUDENTS WHO SCORE HIGHER

02:05:12.538 --> 02:05:13.639
OR MORE EQUIPPED ARE BETTER

02:05:13.706 --> 02:05:16.442
QUALIFIED AND IT ISN'T THE CASE

02:05:16.508 --> 02:05:17.776
BECAUSE WE STARTED TO DO.

02:05:17.843 --> 02:05:19.945
DATA ANALYSIS TO SHOW THAT AND

02:05:20.012 --> 02:05:21.380
SO I THINK WHAT IT'S SAYING IS

02:05:21.447 --> 02:05:23.282
THAT WE HAVE INCORRECTLY USED A

02:05:23.349 --> 02:05:24.850
MEASUREMENT THAT WE THOUGHT WAS

02:05:24.917 --> 02:05:25.985
PREDICTING.

02:05:26.051 --> 02:05:27.853
BETTER -- PERFORMANCE THAT

02:05:27.920 --> 02:05:30.756
WASN'T AND I THINK WHAT WE HAVE

02:05:30.823 --> 02:05:33.292
TRIED TO SHARE WITH -- FACULTY

02:05:33.359 --> 02:05:35.160
AT LEAST AT UC DAVIS AND UCLA

02:05:35.227 --> 02:05:38.097
WHERE WE'RE DOING OUR PROJECT IS

02:05:38.163 --> 02:05:38.697
THAT.

02:05:38.764 --> 02:05:40.065
WHAT IS IT THAT WE'RE TRYING TO

02:05:40.132 --> 02:05:42.902
GET ATIS EXCELLENCE?

02:05:42.968 --> 02:05:45.037
AND WE WANT QUALITY WHAT WE HAVE

02:05:45.104 --> 02:05:48.407
DONE HOWEVER IT IS USED TO TOLL.

02:05:48.474 --> 02:05:50.843
AND MADE IT MEAN EXCELLENT ANY

02:05:50.910 --> 02:05:53.045
QUIRK AND AND AND QUALITY BUT IT

02:05:53.112 --> 02:05:56.315
DOES NOT AND SO IT IS IMPORTANT

02:05:56.382 --> 02:05:58.717
IN ANY ENDEAVOR IF YOU'RE USING

02:05:58.784 --> 02:06:01.921
INDICATORS OR CRITERIA THAT

02:06:01.987 --> 02:06:03.589
YOU'RE ASSUMING LEADS TO A

02:06:03.656 --> 02:06:05.724
CERTAIN OUTCOME TO REEVALUATE.

02:06:05.791 --> 02:06:07.159
WHERE EDUCATORS THAT'S WHAT WE

02:06:07.226 --> 02:06:09.662
DO WE ASK QUESTIONS WE CHALLENGE

02:06:09.728 --> 02:06:11.096
AND WE REVISIT PREVIOUS

02:06:11.163 --> 02:06:12.731
ASSUMPTIONS AND CHALLENGE THOSE

02:06:12.798 --> 02:06:14.199
ASSUMPTIONS SO THAT WE CAN

02:06:14.266 --> 02:06:15.200
IMPROVE?

02:06:15.267 --> 02:06:17.403
BUT WE IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE I

02:06:17.469 --> 02:06:18.971
THINK WE GOT A LITTLE LAZY.

02:06:19.038 --> 02:06:21.240
AND AND AND AND RELUCTANT TO

02:06:21.307 --> 02:06:23.409
MOVE INTO AND EVEN WITHIN HIRE

02:06:23.475 --> 02:06:25.377
AT THE CUT OFF SCORES CLEARLY

02:06:25.444 --> 02:06:26.412
SHOW.

02:06:26.478 --> 02:06:28.247
THAT LARGE PORTIONS OF

02:06:28.314 --> 02:06:30.849
POPULATIONS ARE NOT EVEN.

02:06:30.916 --> 02:06:34.753
ABLE TO ENTER INTO THE THE

02:06:34.820 --> 02:06:36.522
COMPETING PROCESS FOR POSITIONS

02:06:36.588 --> 02:06:38.524
IN GRAD SCHOOL AND SO FORTH AND

02:06:38.590 --> 02:06:40.759
SO REALLY CHALLENGING THOSE

02:06:40.826 --> 02:06:43.429
INDICATORS AS NOT EVEN BEING

02:06:43.495 --> 02:06:44.897
ABLE TO PREDICT THE SUCCESS.

02:06:44.964 --> 02:06:46.398
BUT IT DOES REQUIRE ADDITIONAL

02:06:46.465 --> 02:06:48.367
WORK IT DOES REQUIRE ADDITIONAL

02:06:48.434 --> 02:06:51.537
TRAINING IT DOES REQUIRE THAT.

02:06:51.603 --> 02:06:53.572
THOSE WHO ARE GATEKEEPERS OUR

02:06:53.639 --> 02:06:55.908
REVIEWERS THAT THEY ARE WILLING

02:06:55.975 --> 02:06:59.445
TO PUT IN THE EFFORT TO REVIEW --

02:06:59.511 --> 02:07:01.347
CRITERIA AND CHARACTERISTICS

02:07:01.413 --> 02:07:02.715
ABOUT THOSE WHO ARE ENTERING THE

02:07:02.781 --> 02:07:04.717
PROFESSION AND AND BEING A PART

02:07:04.783 --> 02:07:06.552
OF DISCUSSIONS LIKE THIS ONE TO

02:07:06.618 --> 02:07:07.853
SAY WHAT IS IT THAT WE'RE

02:07:07.920 --> 02:07:09.388
LOOKING FOR WHAT DO WE NEED TO

02:07:09.455 --> 02:07:11.557
DO TO MOVE FORWARD SO JUST.

02:07:11.623 --> 02:07:14.360
CHANGING THE THE CUT OFF SCORE

02:07:14.426 --> 02:07:16.128
IN THE ELSE THAT WON'T CHANGE

02:07:16.195 --> 02:07:17.463
SOME OF THE DATA THAT LANDON

02:07:17.529 --> 02:07:19.865
SHARED SO THERE'S ADDITIONAL

02:07:19.932 --> 02:07:21.767
WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE SO.

02:07:21.834 --> 02:07:23.902
MAKING SURE YOU'RE INVESTED AND

02:07:23.969 --> 02:07:24.970
MAKING SURE PEOPLE ARE

02:07:25.037 --> 02:07:26.472
ACCOUNTABLE TO MOVING FORWARD

02:07:26.538 --> 02:07:28.440
AND REALLY REFLECTING THE

02:07:28.507 --> 02:07:31.310
DIVERSE CITY THAT EXIST IN OUR

02:07:31.377 --> 02:07:32.878
POPULATION.

02:07:32.945 --> 02:07:33.679
WHEN I WAS I STARTED MY CLICK

02:07:33.746 --> 02:07:34.947
OCCUR ON THE SCHOOL BOARD AND

02:07:35.014 --> 02:07:35.948
THIS IS?

02:07:36.015 --> 02:07:37.116
LATE NINETIES EARLY TWO

02:07:37.182 --> 02:07:38.317
THOUSANDS AND ONE OF THE THINGS

02:07:38.384 --> 02:07:39.685
THAT THAT.

02:07:39.752 --> 02:07:41.420
I LEARNED VERY QUICKLY THAT WAS

02:07:41.487 --> 02:07:43.122
FRUSTRATING.

02:07:43.188 --> 02:07:44.823
WHERE THE STANDARDIZED TESTING?

02:07:44.890 --> 02:07:47.926
AND WE KEPT ARTICULATING.

02:07:47.993 --> 02:07:49.194
POLICY SACRAMENTO AROUND

02:07:49.261 --> 02:07:51.230
MULTIPLE MEASURES FOR FOR

02:07:51.296 --> 02:07:52.664
TESTING KIDS AND IT JUST SEEMS.

02:07:52.731 --> 02:07:53.966
THAT THOSE STANDARDIZED TESTS

02:07:54.033 --> 02:07:56.301
WERE USED WHEN THEY WERE HIRED

02:07:56.368 --> 02:07:58.470
BY REALTORS TO SELL HOUSES BY

02:07:58.537 --> 02:08:01.607
SCHOOLS TO BE TO COLLECT EIGHTY

02:08:01.673 --> 02:08:03.008
A OR THE STATE TO PUNISH.

02:08:03.075 --> 02:08:04.510
LOW PERFORMING SCHOOL DISTRICTS

02:08:04.576 --> 02:08:06.545
BUT DIDN'T SEEM TO HAVE ANYTHING

02:08:06.612 --> 02:08:08.447
TO DO WITH THE INDIVIDUAL.

02:08:08.514 --> 02:08:10.349
ADVANCE BETTER CAPABILITY OF THE

02:08:10.416 --> 02:08:13.519
STUDENTS AND SO THIS THIS

02:08:13.585 --> 02:08:15.020
PROBLEM SEEMS TO GO ALL THE WAY

02:08:15.087 --> 02:08:16.722
BACK THERE TO HOW WE

02:08:16.789 --> 02:08:18.590
FUNDAMENTALLY USE.

02:08:18.657 --> 02:08:20.692
I THINK INCORRECTLY.

02:08:20.759 --> 02:08:22.995
THE STANDARDIZED TESTS AND WHAT

02:08:23.062 --> 02:08:24.530
THEIR FOR THEIR NOT.

02:08:24.596 --> 02:08:26.131
A BETTER SYSTEM I ALWAYS THOUGHT

02:08:26.198 --> 02:08:27.232
WOULD BE ONE THAT TRACKED THE

02:08:27.299 --> 02:08:28.700
STUDENTS PROGRESS THAT WAS USED

02:08:28.767 --> 02:08:30.636
BY THE TEACHER YEAR TO YEAR TO

02:08:30.702 --> 02:08:32.538
YEAR TO UNDERSTAND.

02:08:32.604 --> 02:08:33.939
CHALLENGE THAT THAT CHILD HAD

02:08:34.006 --> 02:08:35.574
WEAKNESSES IN THE EDUCATION SO

02:08:35.641 --> 02:08:36.975
THAT YOU COULD MORE TAYLOR THE

02:08:37.042 --> 02:08:39.311
EDUCATION SYSTEM. TO THAT OR THE

02:08:39.378 --> 02:08:40.345
EDUCATION EXPERIENCE TO THAT

02:08:40.412 --> 02:08:43.348
CHILD'S NEEDS AS OPPOSED TO JUST

02:08:43.415 --> 02:08:44.783
RATING A SCHOOL OR NOT.

02:08:44.850 --> 02:08:46.218
AND THAT SEEMS TO BE A LOT OF

02:08:46.285 --> 02:08:47.653
WHAT I'M HEARING.

02:08:47.719 --> 02:08:49.354
NOW AT THE GRADUATE LEVEL WITH

02:08:49.421 --> 02:08:51.523
THE HOURS A. T. OF THE GRE AND

02:08:51.590 --> 02:08:53.392
THAT CERTAINLY WE WE ARE VERY

02:08:53.459 --> 02:08:53.826
WHERE IN.

02:08:53.892 --> 02:08:55.894
MY HAND THAT I I ALSO INCLUDED

02:08:55.961 --> 02:08:58.063
THE IN CAT BECAUSE THEY ALSO

02:08:58.130 --> 02:09:00.699
BEEN ENTERED THIS ENDEAVOR AS

02:09:00.766 --> 02:09:01.733
WELL.

02:09:01.800 --> 02:09:02.768
OKAY SO WE HAVE WE'RE WE'RE JUST

02:09:02.835 --> 02:09:04.002
LOOK AT THE LEGAL PROFESSION BUT

02:09:04.069 --> 02:09:05.270
CLEARLY WE HAVE.

02:09:05.337 --> 02:09:07.906
A LOT OF WORK TO DO.

02:09:07.973 --> 02:09:09.708
FROM A POLICY STANDPOINT FOR

02:09:09.775 --> 02:09:13.679
CALIFORNIA AND HOW WE RATE.

02:09:13.745 --> 02:09:15.714
STUDENTS KIDS MOVING THROUGH THE

02:09:15.781 --> 02:09:17.316
SYSTEM BUT THEN WHO WERE

02:09:17.382 --> 02:09:19.218
WELCOMING INTO THE PROFESSIONAL

02:09:19.284 --> 02:09:20.953
RANKS I IMAGINE DIVERSITY IS A

02:09:21.019 --> 02:09:22.221
CHALLENGE IN ALL OF OUR

02:09:22.287 --> 02:09:23.722
PROFESSIONAL RIGHTS I THINK THAT.

02:09:23.789 --> 02:09:25.657
YES DIVERSITY HAS BEEN

02:09:25.724 --> 02:09:27.626
CHALLENGING AND I THINK IF WE

02:09:27.693 --> 02:09:29.628
ARE AIMING TO BE MORE EQUITABLE

02:09:29.695 --> 02:09:30.829
AND INCLUSIVE THAT IT'S

02:09:30.896 --> 02:09:33.031
IMPORTANT THAT WE LOOK ACROSS A

02:09:33.098 --> 02:09:34.766
RANGE OF FACTORS IN SO.

02:09:34.833 --> 02:09:36.368
IT AS WE'RE HAVING THESE

02:09:36.435 --> 02:09:38.704
DISCUSSIONS IDENTIFY WHAT THOSE

02:09:38.770 --> 02:09:41.573
RANGE OF FACTORS ARE THAT.

02:09:41.640 --> 02:09:46.378
LEAD US TO IDENTIFY CAPABLE AND

02:09:46.445 --> 02:09:48.313
STUDENTS WHO ARE ABLE TO PROCEED

02:09:48.380 --> 02:09:49.848
THROUGH THE PROCESS WHETHER IT

02:09:49.915 --> 02:09:51.016
BE GRADUATE SCHOOL.

02:09:51.083 --> 02:09:52.985
LAW SCHOOL MEDICAL SCHOOL BUT

02:09:53.051 --> 02:09:55.254
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO LOOK AT

02:09:55.320 --> 02:09:59.424
THESE FACTORS AND NOT -- BE LAZY.

02:09:59.491 --> 02:09:59.992
PROFESSOR CALENDAR BECAUSE

02:10:00.058 --> 02:10:01.960
YOU'RE LOOKING AT THAT MORE THE

02:10:02.027 --> 02:10:02.928
EARLY PART OF THE PIPE YEAH BUT

02:10:02.995 --> 02:10:04.696
I WAS TO WEAR OUT THAT -- THESE

02:10:04.763 --> 02:10:06.365
TESTS -- THERE A LOT OF TIMES WE

02:10:06.431 --> 02:10:07.666
TAKE THEM AND ARE ON THEIR OWN

02:10:07.733 --> 02:10:09.134
BUT IN FACT AT LEAST UP YOU KNOW

02:10:09.201 --> 02:10:10.669
THROUGH COLLEGE WE KNOW THAT

02:10:10.736 --> 02:10:12.437
HIGH SCHOOL GPA CONTINUES TO BE.

02:10:12.504 --> 02:10:14.439
A BETTER PREDICTOR FOR MOST FOR

02:10:14.506 --> 02:10:15.841
ENTRANCE AND AND THAT THAT

02:10:15.908 --> 02:10:16.942
COLLEGE BOARD VALIDATES ITS

02:10:17.009 --> 02:10:18.277
TESTS ABOVE AND BEYOND HIGH

02:10:18.343 --> 02:10:20.279
SCHOOL GPA WHAT DOES IT OFFER

02:10:20.345 --> 02:10:21.580
AND OFFERS VERY LITTLE AND OFFER

02:10:21.647 --> 02:10:23.415
SOME WHICH IS WHY WE CONTINUE TO

02:10:23.482 --> 02:10:24.016
USE THAT.

02:10:24.082 --> 02:10:25.317
BUT OFFERS VERY LITTLE ABOVE AND

02:10:25.384 --> 02:10:26.885
BEYOND HIGH SCHOOL GPA AND WE

02:10:26.952 --> 02:10:28.887
KNOW THAT IT IS.

02:10:28.954 --> 02:10:30.255
WHEN WE SEE AGAIN AS EVER?

02:10:30.322 --> 02:10:31.657
AS I SAID IN MY REMARKS THAT

02:10:31.723 --> 02:10:33.859
LEADS -- TO OF THE TEST ITSELF

02:10:33.926 --> 02:10:35.794
IS NOT BIASED IT IS AT IT IS

02:10:35.861 --> 02:10:37.029
BOTH DEMONSTRATING.

02:10:37.095 --> 02:10:38.997
REVEALED -- EDUCATION EXPOSURE

02:10:39.064 --> 02:10:39.932
TO YOU KNOW REAL DIFFERENCES IN

02:10:39.998 --> 02:10:41.667
THE CLASSROOM BUT ALSO A HOST OF

02:10:41.733 --> 02:10:43.101
OTHER DISADVANTAGES AND

02:10:43.168 --> 02:10:44.403
ADVANTAGES THAT STUDENTS HAVE

02:10:44.469 --> 02:10:45.437
BEEN IN TAKING THESE TESTS.

02:10:45.504 --> 02:10:46.238
AS WE HEARD THIS MORNING

02:10:46.305 --> 02:10:47.272
EVERYTHING FROM AN ADDITIONAL

02:10:47.339 --> 02:10:50.242
PREP COURSE NETWORKS AT TEST

02:10:50.309 --> 02:10:52.211
TAKING STRATEGIES AND SO WHAT WE

02:10:52.277 --> 02:10:53.478
SHOULD JUST KEEP IN MIND AS AS

02:10:53.545 --> 02:10:54.813
YOU SAID MULTIPLE MEASURES ALLOW

02:10:54.880 --> 02:10:56.381
STUDENTS TO DEMONSTRATE THEIR

02:10:56.448 --> 02:10:58.016
ABILITIES TO DO THE WORK AND IN

02:10:58.083 --> 02:11:00.018
DIFFERENT WAYS SOME OF WHICH IS.

02:11:00.085 --> 02:11:01.353
REPRESENTED BY TESTS AND OTHERS.

02:11:01.420 --> 02:11:02.254
WELL I TAKES MY WORK IS

02:11:02.321 --> 02:11:04.289
REPRESENTED BY PRIOR ACADEMIC

02:11:04.356 --> 02:11:06.458
HISTORY BACKGROUND AND I THINK

02:11:06.525 --> 02:11:07.492
LAW SCHOOLS AND AND OTHER

02:11:07.559 --> 02:11:08.460
PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS ARE USING

02:11:08.527 --> 02:11:09.795
THAT MORE AND MORE BUT WE

02:11:09.861 --> 02:11:10.796
CONTINUE TO TAKE THE SHORT CUT

02:11:10.862 --> 02:11:11.129
UP.

02:11:11.196 --> 02:11:12.764
A TEST THAT CONTINUES TO SORT OF

02:11:12.831 --> 02:11:15.133
SHOW IMPORTANT DIFFERENCES BY

02:11:15.200 --> 02:11:16.635
SOCIAL BACKGROUND BY RACE

02:11:16.702 --> 02:11:18.403
ETHNICITY BUT BUT IT IN YOU SAID

02:11:18.470 --> 02:11:20.839
BUT THAT THE TEST ISN'T BIAS

02:11:20.906 --> 02:11:21.940
DOESN'T THAT MAKE THE TEST WELL

02:11:22.007 --> 02:11:23.275
THAT'S SEC WITH THAT THAT IS

02:11:23.342 --> 02:11:24.376
THAT IS THE ULTIMATE QUESTION

02:11:24.443 --> 02:11:24.710
RIGHT SO IT.

02:11:24.776 --> 02:11:26.178
AS LONG AS IT DEMONSTRATES I

02:11:26.245 --> 02:11:28.113
THINK WHAT WE FORGET IS THAT --

02:11:28.180 --> 02:11:30.315
IT IF IT IS DEMONSTRATING THAT

02:11:30.382 --> 02:11:32.017
SORT OF DEEP INEQUITIES THAT

02:11:32.084 --> 02:11:33.885
FROM EARLY ON ALL THEN THE IN AN

02:11:33.952 --> 02:11:37.990
INHERENTLY DOES THE MEASURE.

02:11:38.056 --> 02:11:39.691
BECAUSE THE ACTUAL ITEM IS NOT

02:11:39.758 --> 02:11:41.159
BY IS WE'RE NOT ASKING STUDENTS

02:11:41.226 --> 02:11:43.195
TO REFLECT ON YACHTS ARE THINGS

02:11:43.262 --> 02:11:44.396
THAT THEY MAY NOT EXPERIENCE ANY

02:11:44.463 --> 02:11:46.365
MORE A SPORT THAT THEY'VE NEVER

02:11:46.431 --> 02:11:48.233
HEARD OF DEBT HAS REDUCED THE

02:11:48.300 --> 02:11:50.135
ITEM BIAS THAT WE SEE YES TESTS

02:11:50.202 --> 02:11:51.136
TODAY LOOK MUCH DIFFERENT

02:11:51.203 --> 02:11:52.037
THEY'RE MUCH MORE CHEESEMAN.

02:11:52.104 --> 02:11:53.939
ORIENTED OPTED TO THAN THAN THEY

02:11:54.006 --> 02:11:55.874
USED TO BE -- THESE THESE

02:11:55.941 --> 02:11:57.075
PARTICULAR THESE THESE THAT'S AS

02:11:57.142 --> 02:11:59.278
IT USED TO BE MUCH MORE OF AN IQ

02:11:59.344 --> 02:11:59.945
TEST THAN IT THAN AN ACHIEVEMENT

02:12:00.012 --> 02:12:00.312
TESTS.

02:12:00.379 --> 02:12:01.847
NEVER THE LESS IT IS STILL

02:12:01.913 --> 02:12:03.081
CAPTURING.

02:12:03.148 --> 02:12:04.516
BOTH REAL ACHIEVEMENT

02:12:04.583 --> 02:12:06.752
DIFFERENCES AND MANY THAT AS I

02:12:06.818 --> 02:12:07.286
SAID ARE.

02:12:07.352 --> 02:12:09.021
YOU KNOW CORRELATED WITH LOTS OF

02:12:09.087 --> 02:12:10.322
STRUCTURAL INEQUALITY THAT WE

02:12:10.389 --> 02:12:12.324
HAVE IN OUR SCHOOLING SYSTEM AND

02:12:12.391 --> 02:12:12.958
SO WE CAN'T TAKE THAT AWAY FROM

02:12:13.025 --> 02:12:13.692
THE TEST SO.

02:12:13.759 --> 02:12:15.727
THE TEST IS -- YOU KNOW IT'S

02:12:15.794 --> 02:12:17.329
JUST ONE MARKER AS IS MANY MANY

02:12:17.396 --> 02:12:18.597
OTHER MARKERS IT'S JUST THAT

02:12:18.664 --> 02:12:19.665
WHEN WE CONTINUE TO USE THAT TO

02:12:19.731 --> 02:12:20.999
YOUR POINT ABOUT KATE TWELVE

02:12:21.066 --> 02:12:21.933
TESTING IN SCHOOL.

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:23.268
I I BELIEVE WE DO NEED THOSE

02:12:23.335 --> 02:12:24.369
TEST BECAUSE THEY CONTINUE TO

02:12:24.436 --> 02:12:25.370
SHOW US THE SCHOOLS WHERE WE

02:12:25.437 --> 02:12:27.172
NEED TO INVEST MORE RESOURCES TO

02:12:27.239 --> 02:12:28.607
ENSURE THAT STUDENTS.

02:12:28.674 --> 02:12:29.775
ARE IN FACT GETTING ACCESS TO

02:12:29.841 --> 02:12:31.076
GOOD CONTENT CURRICULUM THAT

02:12:31.143 --> 02:12:32.744
ALLOW THEM TO SO I NEW TESTS

02:12:32.811 --> 02:12:34.613
WHICH ARE MUCH MORE RIGOROUS

02:12:34.680 --> 02:12:35.547
THAN THEY USED TO BE OUR COMMON

02:12:35.614 --> 02:12:35.914
CORE.

02:12:35.981 --> 02:12:37.416
SMART BOUNCE TESTS ARE VERY MUCH

02:12:37.482 --> 02:12:39.484
REFLECTING CAN AGAIN THERE IT'S

02:12:39.551 --> 02:12:41.486
NOT JUST THE SAT THERE'S LESS

02:12:41.553 --> 02:12:42.988
RACIAL ETHNIC DISPARITIES IN.

02:12:43.055 --> 02:12:44.690
IN -- OUR STATE TEST AND THERE

02:12:44.756 --> 02:12:45.757
ARE AND ON COLLEGE ADMISSIONS

02:12:45.824 --> 02:12:47.592
TESTS BUT THEY STILL REFLECT A

02:12:47.659 --> 02:12:48.593
LONG WAY TO GO IN TERMS OF

02:12:48.660 --> 02:12:50.462
REDUCING TIME DIFFERENCES BY

02:12:50.529 --> 02:12:51.096
RACE AND SOCIOECONOMIC BACK TO

02:12:51.163 --> 02:12:57.436
DO BUT BUT ACCESS TO THE PREP

02:12:57.502 --> 02:12:57.936
COURSES.

02:12:58.003 --> 02:12:58.570
FOR THE WAY THAT A PARTICULAR

02:12:58.637 --> 02:13:00.105
SCHOOL IS IS ADDRESSING THOSE

02:13:00.172 --> 02:13:02.474
KIDS NEEDS GETTING THEM READY.

02:13:02.541 --> 02:13:03.075
TO TO BE ABLE TO PERFORM THAT

02:13:03.141 --> 02:13:03.909
TEST.

02:13:03.975 --> 02:13:05.777
AND THEN BUT WE SEEN SO MANY

02:13:05.844 --> 02:13:07.612
KIDS WHO ARE GOOD TEST TAKERS SO

02:13:07.679 --> 02:13:09.147
MANY KIDS WHO ARE NOT GOOD TEST

02:13:09.214 --> 02:13:10.582
TAKERS.

02:13:10.649 --> 02:13:12.984
JUSTICE MARK JUST AS CAPABLE.

02:13:13.051 --> 02:13:14.686
BUT ONE WILL PERFORM BETTER

02:13:14.753 --> 02:13:15.954
BECAUSE IN THAT ENVIRONMENT

02:13:16.021 --> 02:13:17.422
THEY'RE BETTER.

02:13:17.489 --> 02:13:18.957
AND THAT BUT THAT DOESN'T GIVE

02:13:19.024 --> 02:13:20.492
US THE RESULT.

02:13:20.559 --> 02:13:22.461
THAT WERE LOOKING FOR ULTIMATELY

02:13:22.527 --> 02:13:23.995

02:17:06.918 --> 02:17:08.720
IN OUR COUNTRY TODAY THERE IS A

02:17:08.787 --> 02:17:10.822
GROWING LACK OF TRUST IN OUR

02:17:10.889 --> 02:17:12.791
DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS.

02:17:12.857 --> 02:17:14.326
IN MANY WAYS THIS HAS ALREADY

02:17:14.392 --> 02:17:15.760
BEEN THE CASE FOR CAP FOR

02:17:15.827 --> 02:17:17.862
COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND YES

02:17:17.929 --> 02:17:19.731
EVEN HERE IN CALIFORNIA. FOR

02:17:19.798 --> 02:17:21.199
EXAMPLE IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE

02:17:21.266 --> 02:17:23.168
CONTEXT THERE'S A DEEP LACK OF

02:17:23.234 --> 02:17:25.036
CONFIDENCE THAT THE SYSTEM WILL

02:17:25.103 --> 02:17:27.539
TREAT ALL DEFENDANTS FAIRLY.

02:17:27.606 --> 02:17:29.040
THIS IS COMPOUNDED BY THE FACT

02:17:29.107 --> 02:17:31.276
THAT NATIONALLY 95% OF

02:17:31.343 --> 02:17:32.811
PROSECUTORS ARE WHITE.

02:17:32.877 --> 02:17:35.380
AND OVERALL 67% OF OUR

02:17:35.447 --> 02:17:37.182
CALIFORNIA JUDGES ARE WHITE.

02:17:37.248 --> 02:17:38.583
VIEW THESE FACTS IN LIGHT OF THE

02:17:38.650 --> 02:17:41.353
REALITY THAT 75% OF INCARCERATED

02:17:41.419 --> 02:17:42.554
MEN IN CALIFORNIA ARE MEN OF

02:17:42.621 --> 02:17:44.055
COLOR.

02:17:44.122 --> 02:17:45.557
THE FACT THAT BLACK BROWN AND

02:17:45.624 --> 02:17:46.825
BLACK CALIFORNIANS ARE OVER

02:17:46.891 --> 02:17:49.961
PUNISHED IS NOT COINCIDENTAL.

02:17:50.028 --> 02:17:51.630
THIS LACK OF EQUAL JUSTICE WILL

02:17:51.696 --> 02:17:53.264
NOT BE REMEDIED SOLELY BY

02:17:53.331 --> 02:17:54.466
INCREASING DIVERSITY IN THE

02:17:54.532 --> 02:17:55.467
PROFESSION.

02:17:55.533 --> 02:17:57.235
BUT IT IS UNDENIABLE THAT

02:17:57.302 --> 02:17:58.870
INCREASING DIVERSITY EQUITY

02:17:58.937 --> 02:18:00.705
INCLUSION IN THE LAW IS A

02:18:00.772 --> 02:18:03.375
POWERFUL PLACE TO START.

02:18:03.441 --> 02:18:04.909
AS HAS ALREADY BEEN TESTIFIED

02:18:04.976 --> 02:18:07.545
TODAY PEOPLE OF COLOR WOMEN IN

02:18:07.612 --> 02:18:09.114
OTHER DIVERSE CALIFORNIANS DO

02:18:09.180 --> 02:18:10.882
NOT FEEL A SENSE OF BELONGING IN

02:18:10.949 --> 02:18:12.183
THE LAW.

02:18:12.250 --> 02:18:13.685
IT'S THAT FEELING WHEN YOU WALK

02:18:13.752 --> 02:18:15.353
INTO A ROOM AND YOU'RE THE ONLY

02:18:15.420 --> 02:18:17.389
PERSON OF YOUR RACE GENDER

02:18:17.455 --> 02:18:20.158
IDENTITY OR SEXUAL ORIENTATION.

02:18:20.225 --> 02:18:21.593
AND YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE NOT ON

02:18:21.660 --> 02:18:23.595
THE SAME PLAYING FIELD.

02:18:23.662 --> 02:18:25.430
YOU CAN'T LIVE UP TO YOUR FULL

02:18:25.497 --> 02:18:26.931
POTENTIAL AS A LAWYER.

02:18:26.998 --> 02:18:29.567
OR FRANKLY AS A HUMAN BEING.

02:18:29.634 --> 02:18:30.769
BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MORE

02:18:30.835 --> 02:18:32.270
THAN JUST THE FEELING.

02:18:32.337 --> 02:18:33.438
THIS LACK OF BELONGING IT'S

02:18:33.505 --> 02:18:35.040
BACKED BY HARD STATISTICS ABOUT

02:18:35.106 --> 02:18:37.108
THE BARRIERS FACING PEOPLE OF

02:18:37.175 --> 02:18:38.610
COLOR ENTERING THE PROFESSION

02:18:38.677 --> 02:18:40.178
STAYING IN THE PRACTICE.

02:18:40.245 --> 02:18:42.414
AND DESCENDING TO POSITIONS OF

02:18:42.480 --> 02:18:43.715
INFLUENCE.

02:18:43.782 --> 02:18:44.916
THE REALITY IS THAT DIVERSITY

02:18:44.983 --> 02:18:46.751
ATTORNEYS ARE MUCH LESS LIKELY

02:18:46.818 --> 02:18:49.154
TO RISE TO POSITION POWERFUL

02:18:49.220 --> 02:18:50.755
POSITIONS IN THE LEGAL SYSTEM.

02:18:50.822 --> 02:18:53.358
SUCH AS JUDGES FIRM PARTNERS OR

02:18:53.425 --> 02:18:56.227
NON PROFIT EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS.

02:18:56.294 --> 02:18:57.696
THOSE WHO DO SO UP OVERCOME

02:18:57.762 --> 02:18:59.531
TREMENDOUS ODDS BUT THE NUMBERS

02:18:59.597 --> 02:19:01.166
ARE STILL FAR TOO LOW GIVEN THIS

02:19:01.232 --> 02:19:03.468
DAY AND AGE AND THE PACE OF

02:19:03.535 --> 02:19:05.637
PROGRESS IS FAR TOO SLOW.

02:19:05.704 --> 02:19:07.272
YESTERDAY I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY

02:19:07.338 --> 02:19:08.740
TO SEE A GOVERNOR GAVIN NEWSOM

02:19:08.807 --> 02:19:10.508
SPEAK AT AN EVENT FOR ASIAN

02:19:10.575 --> 02:19:11.242
AMERICAN HISTORY MOUNTAIN HE

02:19:11.309 --> 02:19:12.077
SAID.

02:19:12.143 --> 02:19:15.814
YOU CAN'T BE WHAT YOU CAN'T SEE.

02:19:15.880 --> 02:19:17.549
SO WHAT CAN BE DONE.

02:19:17.615 --> 02:19:19.184
CALIFORNIA CHANGE LAWYERS AS ONE

02:19:19.250 --> 02:19:20.819
OF JUST A HANDFUL OF STATEWIDE

02:19:20.885 --> 02:19:22.420
ORGANIZATIONS COMMITTED TO

02:19:22.487 --> 02:19:24.189
ADDRESSING THE PROBLEMS STEMMING

02:19:24.255 --> 02:19:26.357
FROM A LACK OF DIVERSITY EQUITY

02:19:26.424 --> 02:19:27.625
INCLUSION IN THE LAW.

02:19:27.692 --> 02:19:29.861
WE EMPOWER A NEW GENERATION OF

02:19:29.928 --> 02:19:30.929
CHANGE MAKERS.

02:19:30.995 --> 02:19:33.198
WE HAVE CREATED A COMMUNITY

02:19:33.264 --> 02:19:34.899
WHERE FIRST GENERATION LOS

02:19:34.966 --> 02:19:37.602
STUDENTS AND LAWYERS FIND A

02:19:37.669 --> 02:19:39.137
SENSE OF BELONGING.

02:19:39.204 --> 02:19:40.638
WHERE THEY KNOW WE ARE COMMITTED

02:19:40.705 --> 02:19:42.173
TO THEIR SUCCESS?

02:19:42.240 --> 02:19:44.476
WE KNOW THAT THEY CAN BECOME THE

02:19:44.542 --> 02:19:46.111
NEXT SUPREME COURT JUSTICE.

02:19:46.177 --> 02:19:47.479
THE NEXT ATTORNEY GENERAL OR THE

02:19:47.545 --> 02:19:50.515

AT THE HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE

02:19:57.589 --> 02:19:59.691
LEVEL. TO INCREASE EXPOSURE FOR

02:19:59.758 --> 02:20:01.326
UNDER REPRESENTED COMMUNITIES TO

02:20:01.393 --> 02:20:02.660

02:20:02.727 --> 02:20:04.529
WE PROVIDE SCHOLARSHIPS TO HELP

02:20:04.596 --> 02:20:06.431
DEFRAY THE STAGGERING COST OF

LAW SCHOOL AND SCHOLARSHIPS TO

02:20:09.267 --> 02:20:10.435

PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT

02:20:25.550 --> 02:20:28.453
OPPORTUNITIES AND ACCESS TO

02:20:28.520 --> 02:20:29.921
MENTORS AND NETWORKS.

02:20:29.988 --> 02:20:31.289
AND WE'RE ALSO BEGINNING TO

02:20:31.356 --> 02:20:32.757
DEVELOP PROGRAMS FOCUSED ON

02:20:32.824 --> 02:20:35.059
INCREASING ACCESS TO PRESTIGIOUS

02:20:35.126 --> 02:20:38.229
STATE AND FEDERAL LAW CLERKSHIPS.

02:20:38.296 --> 02:20:39.564
ON A PERSONAL NOTE I JUST WANTED

02:20:39.631 --> 02:20:41.065
TO SHARE THAT WHEN I WAS A LAW

02:20:41.132 --> 02:20:41.833
STUDENT.

02:20:41.900 --> 02:20:44.169
OF MANY YEARS AGO I RECEIVED A

02:20:44.235 --> 02:20:45.703
SCHOLARSHIP FROM CALIFORNIA

02:20:45.770 --> 02:20:46.905
CHANGE LAWYERS.

02:20:46.971 --> 02:20:49.007
AND INVALIDATED IN ME THE BELIEF

02:20:49.073 --> 02:20:50.542
THAT I COULD BECOME A LEADER IN

02:20:50.608 --> 02:20:51.709
THE COMMUNITY.

02:20:51.776 --> 02:20:53.077
AND I'M PROUD TO SAY THAT I'VE

02:20:53.144 --> 02:20:54.546
MADE IT AND I'M PAYING IT

02:20:54.612 --> 02:20:57.015
FORWARD -- FOR FUTURE SCHOLARS

02:20:57.081 --> 02:20:58.550
AND LEADERS FOR OUR STATE.

02:20:58.616 --> 02:21:00.018
IN SPITE OF OUR SUPPORT THERE IS

02:21:00.084 --> 02:21:01.286
ONE ISSUE THAT'S ALREADY BEEN

02:21:01.352 --> 02:21:02.654
RAISED AND THAT OUR SCHOLARS

02:21:02.720 --> 02:21:04.088
TELL US IS A MAJOR CONCERN FOR

02:21:04.155 --> 02:21:05.356
THEM WHICH IS.

02:21:05.423 --> 02:21:07.392
THE RACIAL DISPARITY IN THE

02:21:07.458 --> 02:21:08.626
RATES OF BAR PASSAGE.

02:21:08.693 --> 02:21:10.328
IMAGINE YOU'RE THE FIRST IN YOUR

02:21:10.395 --> 02:21:12.730
FAMILY TO GO TO COLLEGE AND THEN

02:21:12.797 --> 02:21:14.566
CONTINUE ON TO LAW SCHOOL.

02:21:14.632 --> 02:21:15.867
YOU HAVE AMASSED HUNDREDS OF

02:21:15.934 --> 02:21:17.368
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN

02:21:17.435 --> 02:21:19.337
EDUCATIONAL DAT.

02:21:19.404 --> 02:21:20.538
YOU HAVE FACED EXCLUSION LAW

02:21:20.605 --> 02:21:22.607
SCHOOL BECAUSE OF YOUR IDENTITY

02:21:22.674 --> 02:21:23.107
BUT YOU HAVE NONETHELESS

02:21:23.174 --> 02:21:24.809
GRADUATED AND NOW THE ONE THING

02:21:24.876 --> 02:21:26.411
STANDING BETWEEN YOU AND

02:21:26.477 --> 02:21:29.214
PRACTICING LAW IS THE BAR EXAM.

02:21:29.280 --> 02:21:30.782
THE PRESSURE TO SUCCEED IS

02:21:30.849 --> 02:21:31.983
SIMPLY ENORMOUS.

02:21:32.050 --> 02:21:33.418
WHILE BAR PASSAGE RATES ARE

02:21:33.484 --> 02:21:35.253
HISTORICALLY LOW FOR ALL EXAM

02:21:35.320 --> 02:21:37.789
TAKERS THE REALITY IS THAT IF

02:21:37.856 --> 02:21:39.057
YOU ARE BLACK OR BROWN.

02:21:39.123 --> 02:21:41.125
YOU ARE MORE LIKELY TO FAIL THE

02:21:41.192 --> 02:21:42.060
EXAM THEN IF YOUR WHITE.

02:21:42.126 --> 02:21:44.028
THIS HAS TO CHANGE PARTICULARLY

02:21:44.095 --> 02:21:45.763
SINCE PAST EFFORTS TO REMEDIATE

02:21:45.830 --> 02:21:46.731
THE ISSUE.

02:21:46.798 --> 02:21:48.533
IN ANY SIGNIFICANT MATTER HAVE

02:21:48.600 --> 02:21:50.902
NOT BEEN FRUITFUL.

02:21:50.969 --> 02:21:53.137
A CHANGE LAWYERS WE BELIEVE THAT

02:21:53.204 --> 02:21:54.405
THOSE WHO ARE CLOSEST TO THE

02:21:54.472 --> 02:21:56.241
PROBLEM ARE ALSO THE ONES

02:21:56.307 --> 02:21:57.775
CLOSEST TO THE SOLUTION.

02:21:57.842 --> 02:21:59.244
WHETHER ON THE ISSUE OF BAR

02:21:59.310 --> 02:22:02.447
PASSAGE CAREER PATHWAYS OR IN

02:22:02.513 --> 02:22:03.882
ACHIEVING EQUAL JUSTICE.

02:22:03.948 --> 02:22:05.383
OUR LEGAL COMMUNITY WILL NEVER

02:22:05.450 --> 02:22:06.851
MOVE FORWARD ON THESE IMPORTANT

02:22:06.918 --> 02:22:08.253
ISSUES IF WE DO NOT CREATE

02:22:08.319 --> 02:22:10.188
MEANINGFUL OPPORTUNITIES FOR

02:22:10.255 --> 02:22:11.689
LAWYERS OF COLOR.

IN ORDER TO RADICALLY XCELERATED

02:22:22.867 --> 02:22:24.936
PACE OF CHANGE WE NEED TO HAVE

02:22:25.003 --> 02:22:25.937
LAWYERS WHO LOOK LIKE THE PEOPLE

02:22:26.004 --> 02:22:27.238

WE IN CALIFORNIA ARE SHINING

02:22:33.144 --> 02:22:34.545

DIGNITY.

02:22:43.087 --> 02:22:44.756

SO IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WE

02:24:47.111 --> 02:24:48.513
LAUNCHED THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE

02:24:48.579 --> 02:24:49.747
DATA COLLECTION EFFORT.

02:24:49.814 --> 02:24:51.082
A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND

02:24:51.149 --> 02:24:52.150
ATTORNEYS RESPONDED.

02:24:52.216 --> 02:24:53.317
AND THIS IS OUR FIRST

02:24:53.384 --> 02:24:55.386
OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT TO YOU

02:24:55.453 --> 02:24:57.989

STATE AT I'M.

02:24:59.624 --> 02:25:00.258
I'M EXCITED IN PARTICULAR

02:25:00.324 --> 02:25:02.226
BECAUSE THIS ALLOWS US TO MOVE

02:25:02.293 --> 02:25:03.628
FORWARD WITH DATA INFORM

02:25:03.694 --> 02:25:04.695
STRATEGIES.

02:25:04.762 --> 02:25:07.565
UP UNTIL NOW MOST OF OUR WORK

02:25:07.632 --> 02:25:09.734
HAS BEEN BASED ON ANECDOTE WHAT

02:25:09.801 --> 02:25:10.234
ARE PEOPLE SAYING IN THE

02:25:10.301 --> 02:25:11.069
PROFESSION.

02:25:11.135 --> 02:25:12.170
BUT NOW WE HAVE CALIFORNIA

02:25:12.236 --> 02:25:14.605
SPECIFIC DATA.

02:25:14.672 --> 02:25:17.008
ADAM AND IF YOU I THINK WITH

02:25:17.075 --> 02:25:19.911
PASSED OUT COPIES OF OUR FLIGHTS.

02:25:19.977 --> 02:25:22.814
IF YOU TURN TO THE AM FIRST

02:25:22.880 --> 02:25:24.048
SLIDE AFTER THE COVER.

02:25:24.115 --> 02:25:26.050
THIS REALLY SHOWS IN A NUTSHELL

02:25:26.117 --> 02:25:27.151
THE RESULT OF HIS DATA

02:25:27.218 --> 02:25:28.352
COLLECTION.

02:25:28.419 --> 02:25:30.588
AND HOW ARE ATTORNEY POPULATION

02:25:30.655 --> 02:25:31.923
LOOKS.

02:25:31.989 --> 02:25:34.425
IN COMPARISON TO THE POPULATION

02:25:34.492 --> 02:25:35.460
AT LARGE.

02:25:35.526 --> 02:25:36.994
ATTORNEYS IN CALIFORNIA ARE MUCH

02:25:37.061 --> 02:25:38.663
LESS DIVERSE THAN THE STATE AS A

02:25:38.729 --> 02:25:40.932
WHOLE AND IN PARTICULAR LATINOS

02:25:40.998 --> 02:25:42.300
ARE PARTICULARLY UNDER

02:25:42.366 --> 02:25:43.234
REPRESENTED.

02:25:43.301 --> 02:25:44.202
IF YOU SEE THAT WHILE THE STATE

02:25:44.268 --> 02:25:48.039
POPULATION OF 35% LATINO ONLY 6%

02:25:48.106 --> 02:25:48.372
OF ATTORNEYS.

02:25:48.439 --> 02:25:51.375
ARE LATINA.

02:25:51.442 --> 02:25:54.846
HE TURNED TO THE NEXT SLIDE.

02:25:54.912 --> 02:25:58.249
THE SAME A SIMILAR DISPROPORTION.

02:25:58.316 --> 02:25:59.884
YOU SEE AMONGST WOMEN AND MEN SO

02:25:59.951 --> 02:26:02.286
EVEN THOUGH WOMEN MAKE UP ABOUT

02:26:02.353 --> 02:26:03.788
50% POPULATION THEY REPRESENT

02:26:03.855 --> 02:26:05.490
ONLY 42% OF THE ATTORNEY

02:26:05.556 --> 02:26:07.358
POPULATION.

02:26:07.425 --> 02:26:08.926
WE ALSO COLLECTED DATA ON

02:26:08.993 --> 02:26:10.895
ATTORNEYS A DISABILITIES AND

02:26:10.962 --> 02:26:12.096
LGBT ATTORNEYS.

02:26:12.163 --> 02:26:13.531
OF THE ATTORNEYS WHO REPORTED

02:26:13.598 --> 02:26:15.166
FOUR POINT 8% REPORTED

02:26:15.233 --> 02:26:16.667
DISABILITY.

02:26:16.734 --> 02:26:18.703
AN EIGHT POINT FOUR REPORTED AS

02:26:18.769 --> 02:26:21.506
LGBTQ.

02:26:21.572 --> 02:26:23.841
SO THE BOARD REALLY LOOK AT WHAT

02:26:23.908 --> 02:26:25.176
IS THE ROLE OF THE STATE BAR

02:26:25.243 --> 02:26:26.844
WITH RESPECT TO DIVERSITY AND

02:26:26.911 --> 02:26:27.845
INCLUSION.

02:26:27.912 --> 02:26:28.946
AND IF YOU TURN TO THE NEXT

02:26:29.013 --> 02:26:29.714
SLIDE YOU'LL SEE THAT

02:26:29.780 --> 02:26:31.983
HISTORICALLY THE STATE BAR

02:26:32.049 --> 02:26:33.851
PARTICULARLY THROUGH THE WORK OF

02:26:33.918 --> 02:26:34.919
THE COUNCIL ON ACCESS.

02:26:34.986 --> 02:26:36.754
AND FAIRNESS.

02:26:36.821 --> 02:26:39.023
LOOKED AT MADE PIPELINE AND

02:26:39.090 --> 02:26:41.058

02:26:46.931 --> 02:26:48.399
INCLUSION EFFORTS.

02:26:48.466 --> 02:26:49.834
AND IT HELD A DIVERSITY SUMMIT.

02:26:49.901 --> 02:26:51.435
IN AUGUST OF LAST YEAR AND IT

02:26:51.502 --> 02:26:52.970
WAS THE FIRST OF ITS KIND REALLY

02:26:53.037 --> 02:26:54.972
CONVENING A STATEWIDE SUMMIT OF

02:26:55.039 --> 02:26:57.909
AFFINITY BAR GROUPS LOCAL BARS.

AND WE ASK THEM WHICH OF THE

02:26:59.610 --> 02:27:00.845
STATE BAR BE DOING.

02:27:00.912 --> 02:27:02.146
THE RESULT OF THAT SUMMIT

02:27:02.213 --> 02:27:04.515
INFORMED OUR TWO THOUSAND

02:27:04.582 --> 02:27:05.016
NINETEEN BOARD STRATEGIC

02:27:05.082 --> 02:27:07.685
PLANNING SESSION.

02:27:07.752 --> 02:27:09.287
AND COMING OUT OF THAT THE MOST

02:27:09.353 --> 02:27:10.888
COMMON REFRAIN WE HEARD WAYS WE

02:27:10.955 --> 02:27:12.089
NEED DATA.

02:27:12.156 --> 02:27:14.692
WE CAN'T MEASURE HOW WE'RE DOING

02:27:14.759 --> 02:27:18.429
UNLESS WE HAVE DATA.

02:27:18.496 --> 02:27:20.464
IF YOU TURN TO THE NEXT SLIDE.

02:27:20.531 --> 02:27:22.600
FLIGHT FOUR YOU'LL SEE THAT THE

02:27:22.667 --> 02:27:24.235
ROLE OF THE STATE BAR WITH

02:27:24.302 --> 02:27:25.036
RESPECT TO DIVERSITY AND

02:27:25.102 --> 02:27:27.071
INCLUSION IS ENSHRINED IN ONE OF

02:27:27.138 --> 02:27:27.972
OUR GOALS.

02:27:28.039 --> 02:27:29.574
IN THE STRATEGIC PLAN SO THERE'S

02:27:29.640 --> 02:27:31.442
A FIVE PART FIVE YEAR STRATEGIC

02:27:31.509 --> 02:27:32.410

02:29:48.546 --> 02:29:50.548
THE BAR HAS REALLY FOCUSED ON

02:29:50.614 --> 02:29:52.683
NOW LOOKING AT TWO AREAS LAW

02:29:52.750 --> 02:29:55.386
SCHOOL ATTRITION AND BAR PASSAGE.

02:29:55.453 --> 02:29:56.587
THOSE ARE AREAS WHERE WE HAVE

02:29:56.654 --> 02:29:59.423
MEASURABLE DATA AND CAN MEASURE

02:29:59.490 --> 02:30:01.726
RESULTS AND SUCCESS.

02:30:01.792 --> 02:30:03.027
IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT SLIDE TEN

02:30:03.094 --> 02:30:04.462
WE LOOKED AT LAW SCHOOL

02:30:04.528 --> 02:30:06.630
ATTRITION AND THE NUMBERS THAT

02:30:06.697 --> 02:30:08.265
WE FOUND ARE STARTLING.

02:30:08.332 --> 02:30:10.000
THIS AFFECTS THE NUMBER OF

02:30:10.067 --> 02:30:11.102
PEOPLE OF COLOR WHO ARE ACTUALLY

02:30:11.168 --> 02:30:12.670
EVEN TAKING THE BAR EXAM IN THE

02:30:12.737 --> 02:30:13.804
FIRST PLACE.

02:30:13.871 --> 02:30:15.373
WHICH YOU KNOW IN ASIAN PACIFIC

02:30:15.439 --> 02:30:16.407
ISLANDER STUDENTS HAVE NEARLY

02:30:16.474 --> 02:30:17.775
DOUBLE THE DROP OUT RATE OF

02:30:17.842 --> 02:30:19.110
WHITE STUDENTS.

02:30:19.176 --> 02:30:20.444
BLACK LAW STUDENTS ARE DROPPING

02:30:20.511 --> 02:30:21.912
OUT IT NEARLY QUADRUPLED THE

02:30:21.979 --> 02:30:25.583
RATE OF WHITE STUDENTS.

02:30:25.649 --> 02:30:28.352
M. WELL I'M GONNA HAVE TO RUSH

02:30:28.419 --> 02:30:29.186
THROUGH THE FIGHT.

02:30:29.253 --> 02:30:31.555
AND WITH RESPECT TO CURRENT EXAM

02:30:31.622 --> 02:30:35.726
TAKERS WE IMPLEMENTED A

02:30:35.793 --> 02:30:37.194
WHICH IS NOW CALLED THE POSITIVE

02:30:37.261 --> 02:30:38.696
STRATEGIES AND STORIES PROGRAM

02:30:38.763 --> 02:30:40.731
AND DID IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN

02:30:40.798 --> 02:30:41.966
A CONTROLLED STUDY.

02:30:42.032 --> 02:30:43.300
THE RESULTS OF WHICH ARE VERY

02:30:43.367 --> 02:30:45.336
EXCITING -- I DID READ THE

02:30:45.403 --> 02:30:46.437
MATERIALS THAT WERE FROM THAT

02:30:46.504 --> 02:30:48.139
THAT COMMITTEE STAFF PREPARED

02:30:48.205 --> 02:30:49.240
AND ONE THING I WILL NOTE IS

02:30:49.306 --> 02:30:49.940
THAT.

02:30:50.007 --> 02:30:52.576
EVEN THOUGH THIS 18% IMPROVEMENT

02:30:52.643 --> 02:30:54.345
LIFTED ALL BOTH NOT JUST THE

02:30:54.412 --> 02:30:56.480
RESULT OF PEOPLE OF COLOR WE

02:30:56.547 --> 02:30:58.048
MAINTAIN THAT THAT IS KEY TO

02:30:58.115 --> 02:30:59.049
DIVERSITY INCLUSION THE SAME

02:30:59.116 --> 02:31:00.251
REASON.

02:31:00.317 --> 02:31:01.619
THAT YOU'VE HEARD BEFORE WHY

02:31:01.685 --> 02:31:03.454
FOLKS BELIEVE THAT LOWERING THE

02:31:03.521 --> 02:31:04.388
CUT SCORE WILL HELP PEOPLE OF

02:31:04.455 --> 02:31:06.257
COLOR IMPROVING BAR PASSAGE

02:31:06.323 --> 02:31:07.258
RATES FOR EVERYONE.

02:31:07.324 --> 02:31:08.559
ALSO INCREASES THE NUMBER OF

02:31:08.626 --> 02:31:10.494
PEOPLE OF COLOR ENTERING THE

02:31:10.561 --> 02:31:11.729
PROFESSION.

02:31:11.796 --> 02:31:12.563
SO YOU FEE FROM THE REST OF THE

02:31:12.630 --> 02:31:13.431
SLIDES THAT WE'VE GATHERED

02:31:13.497 --> 02:31:17.034
ROBUST DATA ABOUT DEMOGRAPHICS.

02:31:17.101 --> 02:31:17.768
ABOUT PEOPLE'S CAREER

02:31:17.835 --> 02:31:19.637
ADVANCEMENT HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE

02:31:19.703 --> 02:31:20.871
MAKING IT TO PARTNERSHIP IN LAW

02:31:20.938 --> 02:31:22.973
FIRMS WE'RE ALSO LEARNING THAT

02:31:23.040 --> 02:31:25.276
MOST LAWYERS IN CALIFORNIA OVER

02:31:25.342 --> 02:31:25.843
60% THEY'RE IN THE PRIVATE

02:31:25.910 --> 02:31:26.944
SECTOR.

02:31:27.011 --> 02:31:28.045
SO WE TOOK A DEEP DIVE INTO THE

02:31:28.112 --> 02:31:30.514
PRIVATE SECTOR YOU'LL SEE THAT

02:31:30.581 --> 02:31:31.415
REFLECTED IN THESE LIVES HERE.

02:31:31.482 --> 02:31:33.951
WE ALSO GATHERED INFORMATION

02:31:34.018 --> 02:31:35.419
ABOUT CAREER SATISFACTION

02:31:35.486 --> 02:31:36.554
BECAUSE THAT REFLECTS RISK

02:31:36.620 --> 02:31:40.090
RETENTION IN THE PROFESSION.

02:31:40.157 --> 02:31:41.926
M. AND SO I'LL LET YOU GUYS GO

02:31:41.992 --> 02:31:43.127
THROUGH THE SLIDES ON YOUR OWN

02:31:43.194 --> 02:31:45.162
THERE'S QUITE A LOT OF DATA TO

02:31:45.229 --> 02:31:45.463
GO THROUGH.

02:31:45.529 --> 02:31:47.198
THEM.

02:31:47.264 --> 02:31:48.732
BUT TWO MORE THINGS I WILL AND

02:31:48.799 --> 02:31:49.600
WAY.

02:31:49.667 --> 02:31:51.268
WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT OTHER EXIT

02:31:51.335 --> 02:31:52.837
FROM THE PROFESSION -- WE'RE

02:31:52.903 --> 02:31:54.405
LOOKING TO PARTNER WITH THAT

02:31:54.472 --> 02:31:55.105
WE'RE PARTNERING WITH THE

02:31:55.172 --> 02:31:56.941
JUDICIAL COUNCIL ON A JUDICIAL

02:31:57.007 --> 02:31:58.209
DIVERSITY TOOL KIT.

02:31:58.275 --> 02:32:00.044
AND DOING REGIONAL AT REACH AND

02:32:00.110 --> 02:32:01.679
LOCAL TRAINING EVENTS WE'RE ALSO

02:32:01.745 --> 02:32:03.714
LOOKING AT DISPARITIES IN

02:32:03.781 --> 02:32:05.182
DISCIPLINARY OUTCOME.

02:32:05.249 --> 02:32:06.150
SO.

02:32:06.217 --> 02:32:07.751
IT'S A FIRST OF ITS KIND STUDY

02:32:07.818 --> 02:32:09.920
ON RACE AND GENDER DISPARITY IN

02:32:09.987 --> 02:32:11.489
THE BARS ATTORNEY DISCIPLINE

02:32:11.555 --> 02:32:13.724
SYSTEM AND ITS BIAS AFFECTING

02:32:13.791 --> 02:32:14.859
THE RATE AT WHICH ATTORNEYS OF

02:32:14.925 --> 02:32:19.563
COLOR AND WOMEN ARE DISCIPLINED.

02:32:19.630 --> 02:32:20.831
AB AND I'LL JUST CONCLUDE WITH

02:32:20.898 --> 02:32:22.566
YOU KNOW IT'S REALLY EXCITING TO

02:32:22.633 --> 02:32:24.335
HAVE THIS DATA IT ALLOWS US TO

02:32:24.401 --> 02:32:25.769
TRANSITION AWAY FROM SIMPLY

02:32:25.836 --> 02:32:27.071
ANECDOTAL.

02:32:27.137 --> 02:32:29.974
EVIDENCE TO REALLY WORKING ON

02:32:30.040 --> 02:32:31.775
DATA DRIVEN DATA INFORM

02:32:31.842 --> 02:32:34.044
STRATEGIES -- ARE WE RECENTLY

02:32:34.111 --> 02:32:35.246
MET WITH THE CALIFORNIA LAWYERS

02:32:35.312 --> 02:32:37.081
ASSOCIATION AS WELL AS WITH THE

02:32:37.147 --> 02:32:38.649
CORPORATE MINORITY COUNSEL

02:32:38.716 --> 02:32:40.417
PROGRAM TO GO OVER THIS DATA.

02:32:40.484 --> 02:32:42.653
AND TO DISCUSS ADDITIONAL

02:32:42.720 --> 02:32:43.888
ANALYSES THAT MIGHT BE HELPFUL.

02:32:43.954 --> 02:32:45.022
I'M WE'RE GONNA PLAN ADDITIONAL

02:32:45.089 --> 02:32:46.423
OUTREACH TO THE LOCAL AN

02:32:46.490 --> 02:32:47.892
AFFINITY BARS.

02:32:47.958 --> 02:32:49.126
I'M AND THE INITIAL FEEDBACK

02:32:49.193 --> 02:32:50.227
FORGETTING IS THAT THIS IS

02:32:50.294 --> 02:32:51.495
REALLY USEFUL DATA TO HELP

02:32:51.562 --> 02:32:53.898
TAYLOR DIVERSITY INCLUSION

02:32:53.964 --> 02:32:54.465
EFFORTS TO WHERE IT'S REALLY

02:32:54.532 --> 02:32:56.667
NEEDED.

02:32:56.734 --> 02:33:00.204
THANK YOU GREAT THANK YOU THANK

THANK YOU FOR HAVING THE

02:33:04.975 --> 02:33:06.277
DISCUSSION TODAY.

02:33:06.343 --> 02:33:07.845
AS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE

02:33:07.912 --> 02:33:09.146
THIS IS ONE THE MOST CRITICAL

02:33:09.213 --> 02:33:10.514
THINGS I THINK FACE OUR

02:33:10.581 --> 02:33:12.550
PROFESSION RIGHT NOW AND THANK

WORK WITH FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS

02:33:16.520 --> 02:33:18.255
ON ISSUES LIKE THIS AND THIS

02:33:18.322 --> 02:33:19.757
REALLY HELPS US BRING?

02:33:19.823 --> 02:33:21.125
UP PAPERS LESS AS THE ONE

02:33:21.191 --> 02:33:23.594
THEY'VE PREPARED -- TO THE

02:33:23.661 --> 02:33:25.296
PUBLIC.

02:33:25.362 --> 02:33:27.798
I'M VERY HUMBLED WHEN I LISTEN

02:33:27.865 --> 02:33:29.533
TO THE STORIES OF THOSE WHO'VE

02:33:29.600 --> 02:33:31.402
WHO'VE BEEN HERE TODAY AND AND I

02:33:31.468 --> 02:33:33.871
CERTAIN AT LIKE YOU.

02:33:33.938 --> 02:33:35.940
AND WONDER WHAT ROLE DO I PLAY

02:33:36.006 --> 02:33:40.177
WHAT WHAT VOICE TO I HAVE HERE.

02:33:40.244 --> 02:33:40.744
AND SOMETIMES I WONDER WHY I

02:33:40.811 --> 02:33:41.712
CARE.

02:33:41.779 --> 02:33:43.847
BECAUSE BECAUSE I TO A STUDENT

02:33:43.914 --> 02:33:44.782
PRIVILEGE.

02:33:44.848 --> 02:33:47.084
OF MY PARENTS WERE COLLEGE

02:33:47.151 --> 02:33:48.385
EDUCATED.

02:33:48.452 --> 02:33:49.887
UP AS MANY.

02:33:49.954 --> 02:33:50.955
IMMIGRANT FAMILY CAME AT THE

02:33:51.021 --> 02:33:53.457
TURN OF THE CENTURY BUT NOT WITH --

02:33:53.524 --> 02:33:55.759
CHALLENGES AND AND STRUGGLES

02:33:55.826 --> 02:33:57.962
THAT WE SEE HERE IN CALIFORNIA

02:33:58.028 --> 02:33:59.096
AND PARTICULARLY IN THE COUNTIES

02:33:59.163 --> 02:34:00.531
THAT I REPRESENT THE WORLD

02:34:00.598 --> 02:34:01.565
COUNTIES OF CAT.

02:34:01.632 --> 02:34:03.434
OF CALIFORNIA WITH MODERATE

02:34:03.500 --> 02:34:04.768
COLLEGE LAW AND SAN LUIS OBISPO

02:34:04.835 --> 02:34:07.871
COLLEGE LAW AND KERN COUNTY

02:34:07.938 --> 02:34:09.306
COLLEGE OF LAW.

02:34:09.373 --> 02:34:10.407
IT SHOWS I WAS THINKING I WAS

02:34:10.474 --> 02:34:12.376
LISTENING TODAY OR WHICH PART OF

02:34:12.443 --> 02:34:15.145
MY BACKGROUND RESONATED.

02:34:15.212 --> 02:34:17.348
SO MUCH WITH THESE THESE ISSUES

02:34:17.414 --> 02:34:19.717
AND WHY I THINK IT'S SO CRITICAL

02:34:19.783 --> 02:34:21.952
NOT JUST AS AN ACADEMIC.

02:34:22.019 --> 02:34:23.087
I AM NOT AS I WAS LISTENING I

02:34:23.153 --> 02:34:24.622
THOUGHT.

02:34:24.688 --> 02:34:25.589
YOU KNOW IT IS INTERESTING WHEN

02:34:25.656 --> 02:34:28.826
YOU'RE OLD LIKE I AM.

02:34:28.892 --> 02:34:32.329
AS SIXTY FOUR I THINK BACK

02:34:32.396 --> 02:34:34.531
GROWING UP IN TEXAS.

02:34:34.598 --> 02:34:36.467
AND WHEN I STARTED PRIMARY

02:34:36.533 --> 02:34:37.601
SCHOOL.

02:34:37.668 --> 02:34:40.204
WE HAD SEPARATE SCHOOLS FOR THE

02:34:40.270 --> 02:34:41.538
WHITES AND NON WHITES.

02:34:41.605 --> 02:34:44.241
IT'S IT'S WITHIN MY LIFETIME.

02:34:44.308 --> 02:34:46.577
IT WASN'T INCLUSION AND ACCESS

02:34:46.644 --> 02:34:47.811
IT WAS SEPARATE BUT EQUAL AND

02:34:47.878 --> 02:34:49.346
THAT'S WHAT THE SUPREME COURT

02:34:49.413 --> 02:34:50.714
PRIOR TO THAT TIME SAID WAS

02:34:50.781 --> 02:34:52.282
PERFECTLY FINE.

02:34:52.349 --> 02:34:53.851
IT WASN'T UNTIL I WAS IN FIFTH

02:34:53.917 --> 02:34:55.853
GRADE THAT THE INTEGRATED THE

02:34:55.919 --> 02:34:57.421
SCHOOLS IN TEXAS.

02:34:57.488 --> 02:34:59.189
SO I LIVED THROUGH THAT PROCESS

02:34:59.256 --> 02:35:01.325
OF SEEING WHERE SOMETHING THAT

02:35:01.392 --> 02:35:03.360
WE THOUGHT IN THE PAST WAS

02:35:03.427 --> 02:35:05.062
PERFECTLY OKAY.

02:35:05.129 --> 02:35:08.599
WASN'T EVEN CLOSE TO BEING OKAY

02:35:08.666 --> 02:35:11.201
AND HAD HUGE COSTS TO THE

02:35:11.268 --> 02:35:13.404
QUALITY OF OF OUR SOCIETY IN THE

02:35:13.470 --> 02:35:16.740
QUALITY OF OUR OF OUR EDUCATION

02:35:16.807 --> 02:35:17.708
AND OURS.

02:35:17.775 --> 02:35:19.677
AND OUR COMMUNITIES.

02:35:19.743 --> 02:35:20.944
I THINK WORD OF SIMILAR

02:35:21.011 --> 02:35:22.880
WATERSHED MOMENT WHEN WE TALK

02:35:22.946 --> 02:35:24.014
ABOUT DIVERSITY OF THE

02:35:24.081 --> 02:35:26.116
PROFESSION.

02:35:26.183 --> 02:35:27.918
DEAN RICHARDSON SAID IT FAR MORE

02:35:27.985 --> 02:35:30.187
ARTICULATELY THAN I COULD AND

02:35:30.254 --> 02:35:31.522
VERY DIRECTLY SO.

02:35:31.588 --> 02:35:32.623
THERE'S NOT A LOT I NEED TO

02:35:32.690 --> 02:35:34.425
REPEAT ON THE ISSUE OF THE CUT

02:35:34.491 --> 02:35:35.693
SCORE.

02:35:35.759 --> 02:35:37.061
BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS

02:35:37.127 --> 02:35:39.630
THE FOURTEEN FORTY CUTS COURT IS

02:35:39.697 --> 02:35:40.764
AN ARTIFACT.

02:35:40.831 --> 02:35:42.866
NOT UNLIKE SEPARATE BUT EQUAL

02:35:42.933 --> 02:35:45.035
WAS AN ARTIFACT.

02:35:45.102 --> 02:35:48.572
IT'S IT WAS SET UP FIFTY SIXTY

02:35:48.639 --> 02:35:49.540
SEVENTY YEARS AGO WE KNOW WHAT

02:35:49.606 --> 02:35:51.041
THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE BAR WAS

02:35:51.108 --> 02:35:52.176
THEN.

02:35:52.242 --> 02:35:54.111
IT WAS SET UP TO MEASURE A GROUP

02:35:54.178 --> 02:35:56.714
THEN THAT IS NOT THE COMMUNITIES

02:35:56.780 --> 02:35:58.549
WE REFLECT NOW.

02:35:58.615 --> 02:36:01.952
AS SHE SAID IT IS TIME FOR US TO

02:36:02.019 --> 02:36:03.153
TAKE A VERY.

02:36:03.220 --> 02:36:05.923
CAREFUL LOOK AT THAT ARTIFACT.

02:36:05.989 --> 02:36:07.524
SO THE QUESTION WE MUST HAVE AS

02:36:07.591 --> 02:36:09.893
WELL ON WHAT BASIS COULD YOU

02:36:09.960 --> 02:36:11.962
MAKE THAT CHANGE.

02:36:12.029 --> 02:36:13.997
WELL THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION

02:36:14.064 --> 02:36:16.600
REALLY HELPS US ON THIS IT SAYS

02:36:16.667 --> 02:36:17.634
THAT WE SHOULD NOT HAVE.

02:36:17.701 --> 02:36:19.837
PRE EMPLOYMENT TESTING OR

02:36:19.903 --> 02:36:21.605
LICENSING.

02:36:21.672 --> 02:36:22.906
THAT HAS A DISPARATE IMPACT

02:36:22.973 --> 02:36:26.443
BASED ON RACE GENDER AGE.

02:36:26.510 --> 02:36:28.245
PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD IT'S

02:36:28.312 --> 02:36:29.813
FAIRLY EASY TO UNDERSTAND THAT.

02:36:29.880 --> 02:36:31.482
I THINK IF WE USE THAT MEASURE

02:36:31.548 --> 02:36:34.017
THAT THE CONSTITUTION GIVES US.

02:36:34.084 --> 02:36:35.385
AND WE APPLY IT TO THE

02:36:35.452 --> 02:36:37.154
INFORMATION WE'VE HEARD HERE

02:36:37.221 --> 02:36:37.888
TODAY.

02:36:37.955 --> 02:36:39.957
IT'S FAIRLY CLEAR THAT THE

02:36:40.023 --> 02:36:42.559
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS SHOWS.

02:36:42.626 --> 02:36:44.862
THAT SCORE FOURTEEN FORTY AN

02:36:44.928 --> 02:36:46.964
ARTIFACT OF FIFTY OR SIXTY YEARS

02:36:47.030 --> 02:36:49.533
AGO HAS A DISPARATE IMPACT ON

02:36:49.600 --> 02:36:52.035
THE BASIS OF RACE AND ETHNICITY.

02:36:52.102 --> 02:36:53.070
IS REALLY.

02:36:53.137 --> 02:36:55.439
NO QUESTION ABOUT WHAT THE

02:36:55.506 --> 02:36:57.274
STATISTICS SHOW.

02:36:57.341 --> 02:36:58.275
BUT WE'RE LEFT WITH WELL WHAT WE

02:36:58.342 --> 02:37:00.711
DO NEXT IF THAT'S TRUE WHAT

02:37:00.778 --> 02:37:01.779
SHOULD WE DO.

02:37:01.845 --> 02:37:03.247
AND IN RICHARDSON ALSO POINTED

02:37:03.313 --> 02:37:04.815
OUT I THINK A VERY SIMPLE FACT

02:37:04.882 --> 02:37:07.151
THAT THE THE LAW AND THE CASE

02:37:07.217 --> 02:37:08.285
LAW SAYS THERE ARE TO BE

02:37:08.352 --> 02:37:09.686
PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS ARE

02:37:09.753 --> 02:37:11.388
STANDARDS BASED.

02:37:11.455 --> 02:37:13.824
ON THE JOB PERFORMANCE THAT WE

02:37:13.891 --> 02:37:18.162
SHOULD LOOK [inaudible] TO FORTY

02:37:18.228 --> 02:37:20.197
EIGHT OF THE OTHER JURISDICTIONS.

02:37:20.264 --> 02:37:22.800
HAVE SAID THAT SOMETHING BELOW

02:37:22.866 --> 02:37:24.201
FOURTEEN FORTY AND IN FACT.

02:37:24.268 --> 02:37:26.136
A MINIMUM PASSING SCORE OF THE

02:37:26.203 --> 02:37:28.806
BAR EXAM SHOULD BE BETWEEN

02:37:28.872 --> 02:37:33.510
THIRTEEN THIRTY IN. THIRTEEN

02:37:33.577 --> 02:37:34.144
EIGHTY FORTY EIGHT OF THE OTHER

02:37:34.211 --> 02:37:35.245
JURISDICTIONS.

02:37:35.312 --> 02:37:36.647
I THINK THAT PROVIDES US A

02:37:36.713 --> 02:37:38.215
PROFESSIONAL STANDARD AND

02:37:38.282 --> 02:37:40.417
NATIONAL MEANS THAT WHEN YOU AS

02:37:40.484 --> 02:37:42.653
A LEGISLATOR WHEN THE COURT.

02:37:42.719 --> 02:37:44.555
AS THE DECIDER OF THIS ISSUE

02:37:44.621 --> 02:37:46.256
LOOK TO WHERE CAN WE GET

02:37:46.323 --> 02:37:49.326
DIRECTION ON WHAT TO DO NEXT.

02:37:49.393 --> 02:37:51.361
CAN HAVE SOME COMFORT THAT WE'RE

02:37:51.428 --> 02:37:53.497
NOT ASKING THEM TO WONDER IN THE

02:37:53.564 --> 02:37:55.399
WILDERNESS AND AND PICK A NUMBER

02:37:55.465 --> 02:37:56.733
OUT OF THIN AIR.

02:37:56.800 --> 02:37:58.035
THERE ARE STATISTICS AND DATA

02:37:58.101 --> 02:38:00.704
THAT REALLY CLEARLY GIVE US A

02:38:00.771 --> 02:38:04.541
DIRECTION ON THIS ON THIS ISSUE.

02:38:04.608 --> 02:38:06.410
WE PUT ONE MORE POINT OR TWO ON

02:38:06.476 --> 02:38:08.612
IT AND THEN I'LL SEE THE REST OF

02:38:08.679 --> 02:38:10.080
MY TIME.

02:38:10.147 --> 02:38:11.682
WHAT IS THE EFFECT OF THIS BILL

02:38:11.748 --> 02:38:13.383
AND WE TALK ABOUT STATISTICS AND

02:38:13.450 --> 02:38:14.785
WE LOOK AT BAR CHARTS?

02:38:14.852 --> 02:38:18.388
WHAT IS THE VERY HUMAN COST AND

02:38:18.455 --> 02:38:19.590
I WENT BACK AND LOOKED DEAD

02:38:19.656 --> 02:38:21.592
AGAIN IS LIMITED DATA THAT THE

02:38:21.658 --> 02:38:22.860
STATE BAR THE NAME NATIONAL

02:38:22.926 --> 02:38:25.762
COMMITTEE BAR EXAMINERS PROVIDE?

02:38:25.829 --> 02:38:27.264
I LOOKED WHAT IS THE IMPACT

02:38:27.331 --> 02:38:29.566
SINCE.

02:38:29.633 --> 02:38:31.168
TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN OF USING

02:38:31.235 --> 02:38:32.436
FOURTEEN FORTY IN CALIFORNIA

02:38:32.502 --> 02:38:35.606
VERSES THE NATIONAL STANDARD OF

02:38:35.672 --> 02:38:37.007
THIRTEEN FIFTY AM I ESTIMATE

02:38:37.074 --> 02:38:38.709
USING THE ACTUAL DATA IS.

02:38:38.775 --> 02:38:44.081
A OVER [inaudible] EIGHT

02:38:44.147 --> 02:38:44.581
THOUSAND EIGHT THOUSAND

02:38:44.648 --> 02:38:45.949
QUALIFIED MINORITY CANDIDATES

02:38:46.016 --> 02:38:46.817
FOR THE BAR EXAM [inaudible]

02:38:46.884 --> 02:38:48.619
THEY'VE.

02:38:48.685 --> 02:38:51.221
GONE THROUGH ALL OF THE THE STE

02:38:51.288 --> 02:38:52.756
CHALLENGES THAT WE HEARD

02:38:52.823 --> 02:38:54.091
DESCRIBED TODAY.

02:38:54.157 --> 02:38:56.226
THEY'VE SUCCESSFULLY BEEN TO LAW

02:38:56.293 --> 02:38:58.295
SCHOOL THEY'RE ELIGIBLE PASS

02:38:58.362 --> 02:39:00.264
MORAL CHARACTER AND WE HAVE THIS

02:39:00.330 --> 02:39:03.267
ARTIFACT NUMBER OF FOURTEEN

02:39:03.333 --> 02:39:04.501
FORTY THAT IS THAT HAS KEPT US

02:39:04.568 --> 02:39:06.069
FROM HAVING THE QUALITIES AND

02:39:06.136 --> 02:39:07.104
EXPERIENCE.

02:39:07.170 --> 02:39:09.873
OF EIGHT THOUSAND MINORITY

02:39:09.940 --> 02:39:11.508
LAWYERS SINCE TWO THOUSAND

02:39:11.575 --> 02:39:12.743
ELEVEN WHO WOULD BE LICENSE IN

02:39:12.809 --> 02:39:14.378
PRACTICING HERE TODAY.

02:39:14.444 --> 02:39:16.880
IF WE WERE USING THE NATIONAL

02:39:16.947 --> 02:39:18.148
STANDARD.

02:39:18.215 --> 02:39:19.583
THOSE EIGHT THOUSAND LAWYERS

02:39:19.650 --> 02:39:23.587
WOULD BE ELIGIBLE TO PRACTICE IN

02:39:23.654 --> 02:39:24.721
FORTY EIGHT OF THE OTHER

02:39:24.788 --> 02:39:26.056
JURISDICTIONS.

02:39:26.123 --> 02:39:27.391
SO WE CLOSE BY ANSWERING THE

02:39:27.457 --> 02:39:28.959
QUESTION YOU ASKED EARLIER WHICH

02:39:29.026 --> 02:39:30.527
IS WHEN I HEAR EVERY TIME I

02:39:30.594 --> 02:39:31.929
DISCUSS THIS.

02:39:31.995 --> 02:39:34.398
ARE WE JUST TALKING ABOUT

02:39:34.464 --> 02:39:36.433
DUMBING DOWN THE BAR EXAM.

02:39:36.500 --> 02:39:39.002
MAY I REMIND US THAT THE PURPOSE

02:39:39.069 --> 02:39:41.605
OF THE BAR EXAM IS TO MEASURE

02:39:41.672 --> 02:39:44.007
THE MINIMUM COMPETENCY FOR THE

02:39:44.074 --> 02:39:45.809
FIRST YEAR PRACTICE OF LAW.

02:39:45.876 --> 02:39:47.577
NOT WHO ARE THE MOST EXCEPTIONAL

02:39:47.644 --> 02:39:49.646
LAWYERS NOT WHO ARE THE FORTY

02:39:49.713 --> 02:39:50.747
AND FIFTY YEAR EXPERIENCED

02:39:50.814 --> 02:39:52.182
LAWYERS.

02:39:52.249 --> 02:39:55.185
THE MINIMUM COMPETENCY FOR THE

02:39:55.252 --> 02:39:56.887
FIRST YEAR PRACTICE OF LAW.

02:39:56.954 --> 02:39:58.922
WE LOOK AT FORTY EIGHT OTHER

02:39:58.989 --> 02:40:00.324
JURISDICTIONS.

02:40:00.390 --> 02:40:03.660
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF LAWYERS.

02:40:03.727 --> 02:40:05.262
AND WE FIND EXACTLY WHAT DEAN

02:40:05.329 --> 02:40:06.797
RICHARDSON SAID THERE'S

02:40:06.863 --> 02:40:09.166
ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE.

02:40:09.232 --> 02:40:10.934
THAT REQUIRING A SCORE ABOVE THE

02:40:11.001 --> 02:40:12.903
NATIONAL STANDARD CREATES MORE

02:40:12.970 --> 02:40:15.272
COMPETENT LAWYERS LAWYERS LESS

02:40:15.339 --> 02:40:17.341
LIKELY TO BE DISCIPLINED HIGHER

02:40:17.407 --> 02:40:18.909
INCIDENCE OF GRIEVANCES.

02:40:18.976 --> 02:40:21.144
IN FACT THE STATISTICS SHOW JUST

02:40:21.211 --> 02:40:22.579
THE OPPOSITE.

02:40:22.646 --> 02:40:24.548
SO I WOULD I WOULD LEAVE IT WITH

02:40:24.614 --> 02:40:27.250
YOU ONE QUESTION YOU MIGHT ASK

02:40:27.317 --> 02:40:28.919
IS WILL WORK IN THE LEGISLATURE

02:40:28.986 --> 02:40:30.520
DO BECAUSE THIS ISSUE WAS WITH

02:40:30.587 --> 02:40:33.023
THE SUPREME COURT.

02:40:33.090 --> 02:40:34.491
I WOULD LEAVE ONE THING TO THINK

02:40:34.558 --> 02:40:35.959
ABOUT THINK ABOUT TO CONSIDER.

02:40:36.026 --> 02:40:36.994
I DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE

02:40:37.060 --> 02:40:39.029
UNREASONABLE FOR THE LEGISLATURE

02:40:39.096 --> 02:40:40.630
TO SAY THAT.

02:40:40.697 --> 02:40:42.866
ALL LICENSING EXAMS IN THE STATE

02:40:42.933 --> 02:40:45.168
OF CALIFORNIA THAT FALLS UNDER

02:40:45.235 --> 02:40:46.603
THE CRITERIA OF THIS THE

02:40:46.670 --> 02:40:48.505
CONSTITUTION WHICH ARE PRE

02:40:48.572 --> 02:40:51.074
EMPLOYMENT LICENSING EXAMS.

02:40:51.141 --> 02:40:52.843
SHOULD HAVE TO PROVE ON A

02:40:52.909 --> 02:40:54.945
REGULAR BASIS THAT THEY DO NOT

02:40:55.012 --> 02:40:56.947
HAVE DISPARATE IMPACT AND IF

02:40:57.014 --> 02:40:59.116
THEY DO AS DEAN RICHARDSON SAID

02:40:59.182 --> 02:41:01.351
THE BURDEN SHOULD SHIFT TO THE

02:41:01.418 --> 02:41:03.020
STATE IN THIS COURT THIS CASE

02:41:03.086 --> 02:41:03.987
THE SUPREME COURT.

02:41:04.054 --> 02:41:06.289
I HAVING TO SHOW WHY ANY NUMBER

02:41:06.356 --> 02:41:08.458
OVER THE PROFESSIONAL MEAN

02:41:08.525 --> 02:41:09.459
THAT'S ESTABLISHED.

02:41:09.526 --> 02:41:10.794
NEEDS TO BE JUSTIFIED.

02:41:10.861 --> 02:41:12.062
THANK YOU VERY MUCH [inaudible]

LEGISLATION FOR RECOGNIZING.

02:41:51.735 --> 02:41:52.769
THE IMPORTANCE OF DIVERSITY IN

02:41:52.836 --> 02:41:54.905

02:42:03.547 --> 02:42:05.482
THE STATE BAR BILL FOR EXAMPLE

02:42:05.549 --> 02:42:08.418
THE A REQUIREMENT OF THESE

02:42:08.485 --> 02:42:11.088
HEARINGS AND OF THE REPORT CARD

02:42:11.154 --> 02:42:12.055
THAT THE LEGISLATURE PUTS

02:42:12.122 --> 02:42:14.057
TOGETHER OF WHAT IS HAPPENING

02:42:14.124 --> 02:42:15.425
WITH DIVERSITY IN THE LEGAL

02:42:15.492 --> 02:42:16.793
PROFESSION BECAUSE IT IS AN

02:42:16.860 --> 02:42:17.027
ISSUE.

02:42:17.094 --> 02:42:18.695
WHICH I SEE ON THE BENCH EVERY

02:42:18.762 --> 02:42:21.364
SINGLE DAY AS AFFECTING THE

02:42:21.431 --> 02:42:23.133
PEOPLE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA --

02:42:23.200 --> 02:42:24.935
IT PARTICULARLY WHEN I SAT IN

02:42:25.001 --> 02:42:26.436
THE THE FAMILY WHAT APARTMENT

02:42:26.503 --> 02:42:28.038
WHEN I FIRST WENT ON THE BENCH.

02:42:28.105 --> 02:42:30.340
SEVEN YEARS AGO I SAW THE NEED

02:42:30.407 --> 02:42:31.975
FOR AN UNDERSTANDING OF CULTURAL

02:42:32.042 --> 02:42:34.144
ISSUES OF GENDER ISSUES OF L. G.

02:42:34.211 --> 02:42:36.146
B. T. ISSUES OF DISABILITY

02:42:36.213 --> 02:42:37.914
ISSUES THEY ALL CAME BEFORE US

02:42:37.981 --> 02:42:38.748
IN THAT COURT.

02:42:38.815 --> 02:42:41.251
WHERE WE HAD APPROXIMATELY 70%

02:42:41.318 --> 02:42:43.286
SELF REPRESENTED LITIGANTS TO

02:42:43.353 --> 02:42:44.955
UNDERSTAND PEOPLE'S DIFFERENT

02:42:45.021 --> 02:42:47.023
POINTS OF VIEW AND TO SEE WHY IT

02:42:47.090 --> 02:42:49.726
IS THAT NOT EVERY SOLUTION FITS

02:42:49.793 --> 02:42:52.729
EVERY SINGLE SITUATION?

02:42:52.796 --> 02:42:54.264
SO THE STATE BAR IS IN A

02:42:54.331 --> 02:42:55.632
PARTICULARLY GOOD POSITION AND

02:42:55.699 --> 02:42:58.401
IT NEEDS TO TAKE AN ACTIVE ROLE --

02:42:58.468 --> 02:43:00.470
TO DIRECT AND COORDINATE EFFORTS

02:43:00.537 --> 02:43:01.838
TO INCREASE DIVERSITY IN OUR

02:43:01.905 --> 02:43:05.008
PROFESSION -- SINCE -- TWO

CONNECTIONS WITH THE COMMUNITY

AND WERE ABLE TO GO OUT ALL OVER

02:44:47.577 --> 02:44:49.879

L. BUT WHAT IS BEING REPORTED OR

02:44:55.952 --> 02:44:56.486
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

02:44:56.553 --> 02:44:59.256
KEEP TRACK WHO IS LGBT -- IF

02:44:59.322 --> 02:45:00.690

BE REPORTED IN IN THE STATISTICS

02:45:03.193 --> 02:45:04.894
BECAUSE WE KNOW THOSE GROUPS.

02:45:04.961 --> 02:45:06.730
WE ALSO INVOLVED WITH IMPLICIT

02:45:06.796 --> 02:45:09.199
BIAS TRAINING TO JENNY TO THE

02:45:09.266 --> 02:45:11.268
COUNTY BAR ASSOCIATION'S TO MAKE

02:45:11.334 --> 02:45:13.670
SURE THAT THAT THOSE IMPLICIT

02:45:13.737 --> 02:45:15.071
BIAS IS THAT YOU'RE NOT EVEN

02:45:15.138 --> 02:45:16.339
AWARE THAT YOU HAVE.

02:45:16.406 --> 02:45:18.041
DON'T AFFECT THE CHOICE OF

02:45:18.108 --> 02:45:20.310
JUDGES AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT

02:45:20.377 --> 02:45:21.778
I'VE SEEN MYSELF I SIT ON THE ON

02:45:21.845 --> 02:45:23.446
SENATOR FEINSTEIN'S COMMITTEE TO

02:45:23.513 --> 02:45:25.548
POINT FEDERAL JUDGES AND I HAVE

02:45:25.615 --> 02:45:26.750
ACTUALLY HEARD WITHIN MY

02:45:26.816 --> 02:45:28.351
COMMITTEE AMONG THE FIRST MEMBER

02:45:28.418 --> 02:45:28.585
SAYING.

02:45:28.652 --> 02:45:32.822
ALL THAT PERSON LOOKS LIKE A

02:45:32.889 --> 02:45:34.190
JUDGE.

02:45:34.257 --> 02:45:34.557
WHEN THEY'RE A?

02:45:34.624 --> 02:45:35.625
TALL WHITE MALE.

02:45:35.692 --> 02:45:36.259
AND TO BE ABLE TO SAY YOU KNOW

02:45:36.326 --> 02:45:37.894
THAT PERSON DOESN'T LOOK LIKE ME.

02:45:37.961 --> 02:45:39.663
AND I AM A JUDGE.

02:45:39.729 --> 02:45:42.532
SO SO THOSE TYPES OF THINGS ARE

02:45:42.599 --> 02:45:44.301
ARE THINGS THAT NEED TO BE

02:45:44.367 --> 02:45:45.235
TRAINED IN IT SAID WHAT PART OF

02:45:45.302 --> 02:45:47.003
THE A PART OF THE MISSION.

02:45:47.070 --> 02:45:48.004
OF CO AFTER.

02:45:48.071 --> 02:45:50.640
BUT WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT NOT

02:45:50.707 --> 02:45:51.775
ALL JUDICIAL CANDIDATES ARE

02:45:51.841 --> 02:45:53.243
GOING TO BE AS SELF DIRECTED IS

02:45:53.310 --> 02:45:55.011
JUDGE MISSY IS WHO IS A FORCE OF

02:45:55.078 --> 02:45:56.012
NATURE.

02:45:56.079 --> 02:45:57.714
AND I THINK WOULD HAVE BEEN.

02:45:57.781 --> 02:45:59.082
A JUDGE REGARDLESS OF WHAT

02:45:59.149 --> 02:46:00.717
SITUATION YOU PUT HER IN BECAUSE

02:46:00.784 --> 02:46:03.386
SHE'S JUST SO AMAZING JUST AS I

02:46:03.453 --> 02:46:04.421
EXPECTED THAT MISS PATRICIA

02:46:04.487 --> 02:46:06.189
PATRICIA IS GOING TO BE A JUDGE

02:46:06.256 --> 02:46:07.924
REGARDLESS OF ANY BARRIERS THAT

02:46:07.991 --> 02:46:08.625
ANYBODY PUTS.

02:46:08.692 --> 02:46:10.226
IN THEIR WAKE BUT THAT'S NOT THE

02:46:10.293 --> 02:46:11.928
CASE WITH EVERYBODY THERE ARE SO

02:46:11.995 --> 02:46:13.830
MANY CULTURAL ISSUES THERE SO

02:46:13.897 --> 02:46:15.498
MANY GENDER ISSUES THERE SO MANY

02:46:15.565 --> 02:46:17.901
FAMILIAL EXPECTATION ISSUES THAT

02:46:17.967 --> 02:46:19.235
COME INTO THE THE QUESTION OF

02:46:19.302 --> 02:46:21.004
WHETHER YOU THINK THAT YOU LOOK

02:46:21.071 --> 02:46:21.638
LIKE.

02:46:21.705 --> 02:46:23.707
A LAWYER IF YOU THINK YOU LOOK

02:46:23.773 --> 02:46:24.908
LIKE A JUDGE.

02:46:24.974 --> 02:46:26.843
AND THE IDEA THAT YOU COULD

02:46:26.910 --> 02:46:29.179
BECOME A JUDGE I WAS THE FIRST

02:46:29.245 --> 02:46:31.748
API WOMAN IN A LARGE LAW FIRM IN

02:46:31.815 --> 02:46:36.219
LOS ANGELES BACK IN NINETEEN

02:46:36.286 --> 02:46:36.853
SEVENTY EIGHT WHEN NOBODY LOOKS

02:46:36.920 --> 02:46:37.120
LIKE ME.

02:46:37.187 --> 02:46:40.056
AND IT WAS IT WAS NOT THE IT WAS

02:46:40.123 --> 02:46:41.391
IT WAS REALLY THROUGH.

02:46:41.458 --> 02:46:43.593
THROUGH AGAIN AT THAT TIME YOU

02:46:43.660 --> 02:46:44.928
HAD A MENTOR YOURSELF.

02:46:44.994 --> 02:46:47.097
NOW THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO CAN BE

02:46:47.163 --> 02:46:49.165
MENTORS PEOPLE LIKE HIGHLAND

02:46:49.232 --> 02:46:51.034
CHEN PEOPLE LIKE CHRISTOPHER --

02:46:51.101 --> 02:46:52.635
AND AND I'M NOT GOING TO

02:46:52.702 --> 02:46:53.470
PRONOUNCE YOUR NAME BECAUSE I

02:46:53.536 --> 02:46:54.037
KNOW I'M GOING TO MESS IT UP

02:46:54.104 --> 02:46:56.206
I'LL BUT EVEN THOUGH I KNOW YOU

02:46:56.272 --> 02:46:57.674
VERY WELL.

02:46:57.741 --> 02:46:58.942
BUT BUT THE PEOPLE LIKE JUDGE

02:46:59.008 --> 02:47:00.910
BRAZIL WHO IS OUT THERE ALL THE

02:47:00.977 --> 02:47:03.046
TIME -- TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:47:03.113 --> 02:47:03.913
EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS WHAT THEY

02:47:03.980 --> 02:47:05.915
CAN DO BUT THAT'S ONE OF THE

02:47:05.982 --> 02:47:07.317
THINGS THE COED DOES CALL áP

02:47:07.384 --> 02:47:08.618
WORKS WITH.

02:47:08.685 --> 02:47:10.420
THE LAW ACADEMIES WHICH THIS

02:47:10.487 --> 02:47:11.921
LEGISLATURE'S SO WONDERFUL TO BE

02:47:11.988 --> 02:47:13.723
FUNDING TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE

02:47:13.790 --> 02:47:14.858
UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS A

02:47:14.924 --> 02:47:16.793
PROFESSION THAT THEY CAN GO INTO

02:47:16.860 --> 02:47:18.161
WE WORK WITH THE TWO PLUS TWO

02:47:18.228 --> 02:47:19.295
PLUS THREE PROGRAM.

02:47:19.362 --> 02:47:20.330
IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE

02:47:20.397 --> 02:47:22.232
BEEN IT WITH FROM THE BEGINNING

02:47:22.298 --> 02:47:23.700
WITH A LOT CANNABIS IN THE

02:47:23.767 --> 02:47:25.568

WORK TOGETHER TO TRY TO INCREASE

02:47:28.872 --> 02:47:30.039
THAT PIPELINE.

02:47:30.106 --> 02:47:31.474
BECAUSE WITHOUT THAT PIPELINE

02:47:31.541 --> 02:47:33.176
INTO THE PROFESSION THEN WE

02:47:33.243 --> 02:47:34.978
CANNOT CARE OF PEOPLE WHO ARE

02:47:35.044 --> 02:47:36.613
QUALIFIED TO BECOME JUDGES.

02:47:36.679 --> 02:47:37.414
SO.

02:47:37.480 --> 02:47:39.616
WE ARE INVOLVED WITH LEADERSHIP

02:47:39.682 --> 02:47:40.850
SUMMITS BUT SOMETHING THE STATE

02:47:40.917 --> 02:47:42.585
PARK IS A HAS DONE IN THE PAST

02:47:42.652 --> 02:47:43.920
AND WE'RE HOPING WILL CONTINUE

02:47:43.987 --> 02:47:45.054
DO IN THE FUTURE.

02:47:45.121 --> 02:47:46.623
AND MENTORING PROGRAMS ON THAT

02:47:46.689 --> 02:47:47.857
WE WERE HOPING TO BE ABLE TO

02:47:47.924 --> 02:47:50.794
START UP TO TO PROVIDE MENTORING

02:47:50.860 --> 02:47:52.328
TO TO PEOPLE ALL OVER THE STATE.

02:47:52.395 --> 02:47:54.397
IN ALL SORTS OF AREAS SO THEY

02:47:54.464 --> 02:47:55.899

02:47:55.965 --> 02:47:57.233
IN THE COUNTY SAY WHETHER VERY

02:47:57.300 --> 02:47:59.469
VERY FEW MINORITIES VERY VERY

02:47:59.536 --> 02:48:05.375
FEW OF THE WOMEN OF PEOPLE OF

02:48:05.442 --> 02:48:07.377
COLOR LGBT.

02:48:07.444 --> 02:48:08.445
OF THE DISABILITY OF PEOPLE WHO

02:48:08.511 --> 02:48:09.379
ARE IN POWER MAYBE NOBODY ON THE

02:48:09.446 --> 02:48:10.013
BENCH TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS

02:48:10.079 --> 02:48:10.780
CAN BE SOMETHING THAT THEY CAN

02:48:10.847 --> 02:48:12.148
ASPIRE.

02:48:12.215 --> 02:48:15.084

FOR THE SMALLER COUNTIES.

02:48:27.096 --> 02:48:28.698
BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT BET I

02:48:28.765 --> 02:48:30.767
DON'T THINK THAT THAT TO OF THE

02:48:30.834 --> 02:48:32.035

AND WOMEN AND AND OTHER

02:48:55.692 --> 02:48:57.393
MINORITIES WHO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO

02:48:57.460 --> 02:48:58.695
BE BECOME JUDGES.

02:48:58.761 --> 02:49:00.897
THROUGH THROUGH OUR PARTNERSHIPS

02:49:00.964 --> 02:49:02.265

NO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE

02:52:51.294 --> 02:52:53.229

IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE DO IT THE

02:53:02.572 --> 02:53:04.107
SUMMITS AND I PARTICIPATED IN

02:53:04.173 --> 02:53:05.007

PROCESS FOR BECOMING A JUDGE

02:53:25.361 --> 02:53:26.729
WHAT IS THE GOVERNOR LOOKING FOR

02:53:26.796 --> 02:53:28.464
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO STRESS IN

02:53:28.531 --> 02:53:29.532
YOUR APPLICATION.

02:53:29.599 --> 02:53:31.267
AND THIS IS VERY ENLIGHTENING

02:53:31.334 --> 02:53:32.902
BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE.

02:53:32.969 --> 02:53:34.504
THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT IT TAKES

02:53:34.570 --> 02:53:37.006
AND A USE MYSELF ON HIS EXAMPLE --

02:53:37.073 --> 02:53:38.040
WE'VE HEARD A LOT OF STORIES

02:53:38.107 --> 02:53:40.476
ABOUT PEOPLE'S EXAMPLES AND

02:53:40.543 --> 02:53:42.078
UNFORTUNATELY I I KIND OF FIT

02:53:42.145 --> 02:53:43.513
INTO THAT SAME THEME I WAS THE

02:53:43.579 --> 02:53:44.781
FIRST IN MY FAMILY TO GO TO

02:53:44.847 --> 02:53:46.983
COLLEGE -- WHEN I GRADUATED FROM

02:53:47.049 --> 02:53:47.784
HIGH SCHOOL I HAD THE

02:53:47.850 --> 02:53:49.352
DISTINCTION OF HAVING ONE OF THE

02:53:49.418 --> 02:53:51.454
LOWEST GPAS OF ANY GRADUATING

02:53:51.521 --> 02:53:52.388
SENIOR?

02:53:52.455 --> 02:53:53.823
SO I PROBABLY WENT TO A

02:53:53.890 --> 02:53:55.091
COMMUNITY COLLEGE.

02:53:55.158 --> 02:53:57.560
WHERE AFTER TWO YEARS I WAS ABLE

02:53:57.627 --> 02:53:59.662
TO TRANSFER TO THE UCLA?

02:53:59.729 --> 02:54:02.231
AND I SHE'S MY **** DEGREE AT

02:54:02.298 --> 02:54:05.835
UCLA THEN WENT ON TO UCLA LAW

02:54:05.902 --> 02:54:06.602
SCHOOL.

02:54:06.669 --> 02:54:07.436
AND WHEN I JOIN THE COUNTY

02:54:07.503 --> 02:54:08.337
COUNSEL'S OFFICE AFTER A PASSED

02:54:08.404 --> 02:54:08.704
THE BAR EXAM.

02:54:08.771 --> 02:54:09.739
I WAS ONE OF THE FIRST AFRICAN

02:54:09.806 --> 02:54:11.407
AMERICANS TO WORK AT THE LOS

02:54:11.474 --> 02:54:13.009
ANGELES COUNTY COUNSEL'S OFFICE.

02:54:13.075 --> 02:54:14.443
WHICH DIDN'T START HIRING WOMEN

02:54:14.510 --> 02:54:15.812
UNTIL THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES

02:54:15.878 --> 02:54:16.846
EVEN THOUGH THE OPPOSITE BEEN IN

02:54:16.913 --> 02:54:18.080
EXISTENCE SINCE ABOUT THE

02:54:18.147 --> 02:54:20.249
NINETEEN TWENTIES.

02:54:20.316 --> 02:54:20.783
AND I CAME ON IN THE EARLY

02:54:20.850 --> 02:54:22.185
EIGHTIES.

02:54:22.251 --> 02:54:24.020
SO IT'S AN INTERESTING STORY.

02:54:24.086 --> 02:54:25.321
BUT AN IMPORTANT STORY BECAUSE

02:54:25.388 --> 02:54:26.656
THAT **** IN HELPED SHAPE WHO WE

02:54:26.722 --> 02:54:27.824
ARE.

02:54:27.890 --> 02:54:29.559
AND EXPLAINS WHY WE HAVE THIS

02:54:29.625 --> 02:54:31.327
COMMITMENT TO DIVERSITY THAT YOU

02:54:31.394 --> 02:54:32.829
SEE OF MIKE'S MYSELF AND ALL THE

02:54:32.895 --> 02:54:34.597
OTHER PANELISTS -- WHO SPOKEN TO

02:54:34.664 --> 02:54:36.032
YOU THIS MORNING IT COMES FROM

02:54:36.098 --> 02:54:39.068
LIFE EXPERIENCE IT COMES FROM?

02:54:39.135 --> 02:54:40.169
WHAT WE'VE HAD TO GO?

02:54:40.236 --> 02:54:41.370
FOR SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

02:54:41.437 --> 02:54:42.839
THE COUNCIL HAS DONE IN TERMS OF

02:54:42.905 --> 02:54:43.739
WE TALK ABOUT.

02:54:43.806 --> 02:54:45.741
DIVERSITY PATHWAYS.

02:54:45.808 --> 02:54:46.876
AND ONE OF THINGS WE DO IS WE

02:54:46.943 --> 02:54:47.844
FOCUS ON HIRING SUBORDINATE

02:54:47.910 --> 02:54:49.645
JUDICIAL OFFICERS OUR

02:54:49.712 --> 02:54:51.547
COMMISSIONERS REFEREES --

02:54:51.614 --> 02:54:53.382
THERE'S OVER TWO HUNDRED FIFTY I

02:54:53.449 --> 02:54:56.319
THINK IN THE STATE MANY OF THOSE --

02:54:56.385 --> 02:54:57.787
COMMISSIONERS GO ON TO BE JUDGES

02:54:57.854 --> 02:54:59.322
THINK OF RECENTLY I THINK THE

02:54:59.388 --> 02:55:02.124
NUMBERS ARE ABOUT A HUNDRED AND

02:55:02.191 --> 02:55:02.725
THIRTY TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE

02:55:02.792 --> 02:55:03.292
HAVE BEEN APPOINTED BY THE

02:55:03.359 --> 02:55:03.693
GOVERNOR.

02:55:03.759 --> 02:55:04.627
BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S

02:55:04.694 --> 02:55:05.828
IMPORTANT WHEN YOU LOOK AT

02:55:05.895 --> 02:55:07.597
COMMISSIONERS AS THEY ARE

02:55:07.663 --> 02:55:08.931
SELECTED BY THE JUDGES.

02:55:08.998 --> 02:55:10.233
SO IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE

02:55:10.299 --> 02:55:12.034
SELECTION COMMITTEES.

02:55:12.101 --> 02:55:14.871
ARE MADE UP AND HAVE DIVERSITY.

02:55:14.937 --> 02:55:16.572
BECAUSE OFTEN TIMES WHEN YOU

02:55:16.639 --> 02:55:17.807
TALK ABOUT DIVERSITY AND

02:55:17.874 --> 02:55:20.042
SELECTION PEOPLE SELECT PEOPLE

02:55:20.109 --> 02:55:21.711
WHO LOOK LIKE VAMP.

02:55:21.777 --> 02:55:23.012
SO ONE OF THE THINGS WERE

02:55:23.079 --> 02:55:25.014
FOCUSING ON IN LOS ANGELES WHERE

02:55:25.081 --> 02:55:26.115
WE'RE GOING TO BE HAVING A

02:55:26.182 --> 02:55:27.483

02:55:34.857 --> 02:55:35.791
COMMITTEE.

02:55:35.858 --> 02:55:37.059
AND ONE OF THE THINGS I CAN

02:55:37.126 --> 02:55:39.028
GUARANTEE IS THAT IT WILL BE

02:55:39.095 --> 02:55:39.729
DIVERSE.

02:55:39.795 --> 02:55:41.230
I'M EXPANDING THE NUMBER OF

02:55:41.297 --> 02:55:42.632
PEOPLE ON THE COMMITTEE JUST TO

02:55:42.698 --> 02:55:45.534
MAKE SURE WE DO HAVE DIVERSITY.

02:55:45.601 --> 02:55:47.737
AND I HAVE A GOAL OF MAKING SURE

02:55:47.803 --> 02:55:49.138
WE HAVE EQUAL NUMBER OF MEN AND

02:55:49.205 --> 02:55:49.939
WOMEN.

02:55:50.006 --> 02:55:52.341
ND AFRICAN AMERICANS LATINOS

02:55:52.408 --> 02:55:54.277
ASIAN AMERICANS ON THAT

02:55:54.343 --> 02:55:55.912
COMMITTEE AS WELL AS WHITES SO

02:55:55.978 --> 02:55:57.813
THAT IT REFLECTS WHO ARE COURT

IS.

02:55:58.781 --> 02:56:00.850
IN WHO ARE COMMUNITIES ANOTHER

02:56:00.917 --> 02:56:02.585
THING THAT THE COUNCIL SUPPORTS.

02:56:02.652 --> 02:56:03.786
WE HAVE VOLUNTEER ATTORNEY

02:56:03.853 --> 02:56:05.788
SERVING AS TEMPORARY JUDGES.

02:56:05.855 --> 02:56:07.290
AND THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT WE USE

02:56:07.356 --> 02:56:09.358
THEM IN TRAFFIC MUSEUM IN SMALL

02:56:09.425 --> 02:56:09.959

WHICH IS DONE BY THE JUDGES.

02:56:14.997 --> 02:56:16.899
THOSE PEOPLE ON THAT SELECTION

02:56:16.966 --> 02:56:18.868
COMMITTEE HAVE TO BE DIVERSE.

02:56:18.935 --> 02:56:22.004
BECAUSE AGAIN WE GO BACK TO THE

02:56:22.071 --> 02:56:22.605
YOU PICK PEOPLE WHO LOOK LIKE

02:56:22.672 --> 02:56:23.873
YOU.

02:56:23.940 --> 02:56:24.874
SO WE'VE GOT TO HAVE WOMEN WE'VE

02:56:24.941 --> 02:56:26.409
GOT TO HAVE MINORITIES TO MAKE

02:56:26.475 --> 02:56:27.977
SURE WE HAVE DIVERSITY.

02:56:28.044 --> 02:56:29.745
IN THOSE TWO AREAS BECAUSE OFTEN

02:56:29.812 --> 02:56:30.579
TIMES THAT'S A GOOD TRAINING

02:56:30.646 --> 02:56:32.281
GROUND. FOR SOMEBODY TO BECOME A

02:56:32.348 --> 02:56:33.649
JUDGE TO BE TO GET THE

02:56:33.716 --> 02:56:36.052
EXPERIENCE TO GET THE KNOWLEDGE

02:56:36.118 --> 02:56:37.887
TO GET THE RECOGNITION THEY NEED

02:56:37.954 --> 02:56:39.689
TO BECOME A JUDGE SO THE COUNCIL

02:56:39.755 --> 02:56:40.890

02:56:40.957 --> 02:56:42.925
THE BEEN VERY ACTIVE IN MAKING

02:56:42.992 --> 02:56:44.293
SURE THAT THAT HAPPENS.

02:56:44.360 --> 02:56:45.328
ANOTHER THING THAT THE COUNCIL

02:56:45.394 --> 02:56:48.130
FOCUSING ON IS MANAGING AND

02:56:48.197 --> 02:56:49.765
AVOIDING IMPLICIT BIAS.

02:56:49.832 --> 02:56:50.866
SO KIND OF WHAT I'VE TALKED

02:56:50.933 --> 02:56:52.535
ABOUT JUST PREVIOUSLY WHEN YOU

02:56:52.601 --> 02:56:54.403

02:56:54.470 --> 02:56:55.705
AND IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE YOU.

02:56:55.771 --> 02:56:56.739
THAT'S KIND OF THAT IMPLICIT

02:56:56.806 --> 02:56:58.908
BIAS COMING INTO PLAY WHERE YOU

PEOPLE IF WE DO THAT.

02:57:03.179 --> 02:57:04.347
BUT IT'S JUST THAT IMPLICIT BIAS

02:57:04.413 --> 02:57:05.982
THAT WE HAVE.

02:57:06.048 --> 02:57:07.516
SO IN RECOGNITION OF THIS.

02:57:07.583 --> 02:57:08.985
AND WE AGAIN [inaudible]

02:57:09.051 --> 02:57:13.022
WE NEED TO HAVE A DIVERSE BRANCH --

02:57:13.089 --> 02:57:13.923

DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION.

02:59:33.696 --> 02:59:34.430
THE GOAL OF THE DIVERSITY TOOL

02:59:34.497 --> 02:59:36.465

02:59:37.867 --> 02:59:40.202
WAYS. FOR LOCAL COURTS AND BAR

02:59:40.269 --> 02:59:42.638
ASSOCIATIONS TO ENGAGE GUY AND

02:59:42.705 --> 02:59:44.140
MENTOR POTENTIAL JUDICIAL

02:59:44.206 --> 02:59:46.742
APPLICANTS [inaudible]

02:59:46.809 --> 02:59:51.013
IN ADDITION. FOR THE JUDGES.

02:59:51.080 --> 02:59:53.082
I THINK IT IS SO VERY IMPORTANT

02:59:53.149 --> 02:59:55.317
FOR US TO BE ENGAGED.

02:59:55.384 --> 02:59:56.552
AND ALTHOUGH WE HAVE THE TOOL

02:59:56.619 --> 02:59:58.220
KIT AND IT'S VERY HELPFUL.

02:59:58.287 --> 02:59:59.822
AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE FUTUR

02:59:59.889 --> 03:00:01.957
JUDICIAL SUMMITS AGAIN WHICH ARE

03:00:02.024 --> 03:00:02.491
VERY HELPFUL.

03:00:02.558 --> 03:00:03.692
IN ORDER TO APPOINT A SECRETARY

03:00:03.759 --> 03:00:05.361
MARTIN JENKINS IS GONNA BE

03:00:05.427 --> 03:00:06.095
DISSIPATE.

03:00:06.162 --> 03:00:07.329
AND SOME OF THESE JUDICIAL

03:00:07.396 --> 03:00:08.164
SUMMITS.

03:00:08.230 --> 03:00:09.698
WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IS FOR

03:00:09.765 --> 03:00:11.233
JUDGES AND THIS IS WHERE I HAVE

03:00:11.300 --> 03:00:12.735
TO LOOK TO MY COLLEAGUES.

03:00:12.801 --> 03:00:15.204
AROUND THE BENCH.

03:00:15.271 --> 03:00:17.139
WE HAVE TO BECOME MORE ENGAGED

03:00:17.206 --> 03:00:19.575
WE HAVE TO BE MORE HANDS ON THE

03:00:19.642 --> 03:00:20.910
DIFFERENCE TO ACHIEVING

03:00:20.976 --> 03:00:22.545
DIVERSITY IS AND IT'S BEEN

03:00:22.611 --> 03:00:25.080
ALLUDED TO HERE ALREADY IS.

03:00:25.147 --> 03:00:26.649
YOU HAVE TO HAVE MENTORING.

03:00:26.715 --> 03:00:28.317
YOU HAVE TO HAVE SUPPORT I DON'T

03:00:28.384 --> 03:00:29.518
CARE WHO YOU ARE.

03:00:29.585 --> 03:00:31.820
BECAUSE OFTENTIMES SOMEBODY HAS

03:00:31.887 --> 03:00:33.255
TO BELIEVE IN YOU IN ORDER FOR

03:00:33.322 --> 03:00:35.391
YOU TO BELIEVE IN YOURSELF.

03:00:35.457 --> 03:00:36.559
AND THAT'S WHERE JUDGES HAVE AN

03:00:36.625 --> 03:00:38.294
IMPORTANT ROLE.

03:00:38.360 --> 03:00:39.995
THE MOST IMPORTANT INFLUENCE ON

03:00:40.062 --> 03:00:42.331
ME AND BECOMING A JUDGE.

03:00:42.398 --> 03:00:45.301
IS ONE ANOTHER JUDGE TOLD ME.

03:00:45.367 --> 03:00:45.834
I THINK YOU SHOULD BECOME

03:00:45.901 --> 03:00:47.269
PROJECT.

03:00:47.336 --> 03:00:48.470
THAT REALLY TURNED ON THE LIGHT

03:00:48.537 --> 03:00:50.172
FOR ME.

03:00:50.239 --> 03:00:52.007
BECAUSE GROWING UP I DIDN'T KNOW

03:00:52.074 --> 03:00:53.275
WHAT THE JUDGES DIDN'T KNOW ANY

03:00:53.342 --> 03:00:54.276
LAWYERS.

03:00:54.343 --> 03:00:55.611
AS I SAID THE FIRST IN MY FAMILY

03:00:55.678 --> 03:00:57.813
TO GO TO COLLEGE BUT A JUDGE WHO

03:00:57.880 --> 03:00:59.782
TOOK THE TIME TO TELL ME AFTER A

03:00:59.848 --> 03:01:01.750
TRIAL.

03:01:01.817 --> 03:01:02.851
THAT YOU KNOW WHAT YOU THINK YOU

03:01:02.918 --> 03:01:04.286
REALLY ARE PURSUE A JUDICIAL

03:01:04.353 --> 03:01:06.188
CAREER.

03:01:06.255 --> 03:01:07.690
THAT'S WHAT MADE THE DIFFERENCE

03:01:07.756 --> 03:01:08.791
AND THAT IS SO VERY VERY

03:01:08.857 --> 03:01:10.492
IMPORTANT.

03:01:10.559 --> 03:01:12.995
WE HAVE A LOT OF MINORITY GROUPS

03:01:13.062 --> 03:01:14.964
THAT ARE INVOLVED -- FROM

03:01:15.030 --> 03:01:16.432
AFRICAN AMERICAN JUDGES THE

03:01:16.498 --> 03:01:17.933
LATINO JUDGES THE ASIAN JUDGES

03:01:18.000 --> 03:01:19.001
WERE TRIED TO MENTOR.

03:01:19.068 --> 03:01:20.970
JUDICIAL APPLICANTS BUT PART OF

03:01:21.036 --> 03:01:22.738
THAT PROCESS WITH WHAT WE DO IS

03:01:22.805 --> 03:01:24.006
WE IDENTIFY.

03:01:24.073 --> 03:01:25.941
THOSE LAWYERS WHO WE THINK COULD

03:01:26.008 --> 03:01:28.711
BE GOOD JUDGES BECAUSE JUDGES WE

03:01:28.777 --> 03:01:31.247
BELIEVE OUR ANALYSTS LIKE SAY

03:01:31.313 --> 03:01:32.781
FOR THE GROUP THAT I BELONG.

03:01:32.848 --> 03:01:33.616
TO WHO BETTER THAN US TO

03:01:33.682 --> 03:01:34.750
IDENTIFY WHO CAN BE A GOOD JUDGE

03:01:34.817 --> 03:01:35.918
WE SEE THEM EVERY DAY WE SEE THE

03:01:35.985 --> 03:01:36.785
LAWYERS.

03:01:36.852 --> 03:01:38.587
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THE PROCESS.

03:01:38.654 --> 03:01:40.723
SO FOR JUDGES IT'S IMPORTANT

03:01:40.789 --> 03:01:42.591
THAT WE ARE ENGAGED IN THE

03:01:42.658 --> 03:01:44.727
MENTORING THE LEADERSHIP.

03:01:44.793 --> 03:01:45.327
WE ALSO HAVE TO GOING TO THE

03:01:45.394 --> 03:01:46.829
HIGH SCHOOLS WE ALSO HAVE TO

03:01:46.895 --> 03:01:48.897
GOING TO THE JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOLS.

03:01:48.964 --> 03:01:51.066
BECAUSE THAT PIPELINE STARTS

03:01:51.133 --> 03:01:53.002
VERY VERY EARLY ON SO AT THE LA

03:01:53.068 --> 03:01:54.136
SUPERIOR COURT WE HAVE A PROGRAM

03:01:54.203 --> 03:01:56.205
WE WILL RECALL IT -- THE WOMEN'S

03:01:56.272 --> 03:01:57.473
CONFERENCE AND THE MEN'S

03:01:57.539 --> 03:01:58.841
CONFERENCE AND ACTUALLY JUST --

03:01:58.907 --> 03:02:00.276
JAY IS INVOLVED IN THAT WERE

03:02:00.342 --> 03:02:01.710
VERY HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS.

03:02:01.777 --> 03:02:03.679
INTO THE COURT AND IT'S BEEN

03:02:03.746 --> 03:02:04.280
PRETTY MUCH HALF A DAY IN THE

03:02:04.346 --> 03:02:05.014
COURT.

03:02:05.080 --> 03:02:06.749
TALKING TO JUDGES LISTENING THE

03:02:06.815 --> 03:02:10.052
PANELS BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY ONE

03:02:10.119 --> 03:02:11.253
ONE ON ONE FACE TO FACE

03:02:11.320 --> 03:02:13.188
COMMUNICATION WITH JUDGES.

03:02:13.255 --> 03:02:14.623
SO REALLY I THINK.

03:02:14.690 --> 03:02:17.026
WE AS JUDGES HAVE A TREMENDOUS

03:02:17.092 --> 03:02:17.960
ROLE TO PLAY.

03:02:18.027 --> 03:02:19.995
AND MAKING SURE THAT WE ACHIEVE

03:02:20.062 --> 03:02:21.597
DIVERSITY.

03:02:21.664 --> 03:02:23.465
THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE.

03:02:23.532 --> 03:02:24.967
IT CAN BE DONE.

03:02:25.034 --> 03:02:26.001
ANOTHER THING THAT'S VERY

03:02:26.068 --> 03:02:28.437
IMPORTANT IS FOR STUDENTS AND

03:02:28.504 --> 03:02:29.972
AND THIS IS BEEN TALKED ABOUT BY

03:02:30.039 --> 03:02:30.939
A LOT OF PEOPLE.

03:02:31.006 --> 03:02:33.842
TERMS OF GETTING INTO LAW SCHOOL.

03:02:33.909 --> 03:02:34.743
YOU KNOW WE NEED TO MAKE SURE

03:02:34.810 --> 03:02:36.211
THAT THEIR PREPARATION COURSES

03:02:36.278 --> 03:02:37.813
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY WHETHER

03:02:37.880 --> 03:02:38.981
IT'S GETTING INTO LAW SCHOOL

03:02:39.048 --> 03:02:40.783
PREPARING FOR THE LSAT PREPARE

03:02:40.849 --> 03:02:43.352
FOR THE BAR EXAM THERE'S GOT TO

03:02:43.419 --> 03:02:43.886
BE SOME FORM OF FINANCIAL

03:02:43.952 --> 03:02:44.320
ASSISTANCE.

03:02:44.386 --> 03:02:45.821
BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE BAR

03:02:45.888 --> 03:02:47.222
EXAM IT COSTS HUNDREDS OF

03:02:47.289 --> 03:02:49.825
DOLLARS. TO TAKE THAT EXAM PREP

03:02:49.892 --> 03:02:50.693
COURSE WHICH I'VE HEARD

03:02:50.759 --> 03:02:53.228
MENTIONED EARLIER CAN COST THREE

03:02:53.295 --> 03:02:54.363
TO FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS.

03:02:54.430 --> 03:02:55.364
AND IF YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT MORE

03:02:55.431 --> 03:02:58.100
THAN ONCE WHICH IS INDICATED IN

03:02:58.167 --> 03:02:58.801
TERMS OF WHAT MINORITIES HAVE TO

03:02:58.867 --> 03:02:59.568
DO.

03:02:59.635 --> 03:03:01.337
THE FINANCIAL COST.

03:03:01.403 --> 03:03:02.638
CAN THEN BECOME A PERIOD.

03:03:02.705 --> 03:03:04.673
JUST LIKE THAT FINANCIAL COSTS

03:03:04.740 --> 03:03:05.908
BECAUSE CAN BECOME A BEAR GOING

03:03:05.974 --> 03:03:07.109
TO LAW SCHOOL.

03:03:07.176 --> 03:03:08.110
BECAUSE YOU GOT TO TAKE THE LSAT

03:03:08.177 --> 03:03:09.411
TESTS MAYBE HAVE TO TAKE A MORE

03:03:09.478 --> 03:03:11.080
THAN ONCE WE NEED A PREPARATION

03:03:11.146 --> 03:03:12.548
COURSE YOU'VE ALREADY GOT

03:03:12.614 --> 03:03:13.882
COLLEGE BILLS.

03:03:13.949 --> 03:03:15.984
ON TOP OF THAT SO SOME KIND OF

03:03:16.051 --> 03:03:18.754
SCHOLARSHIP FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE

03:03:18.821 --> 03:03:19.755
ONE OF THINGS WE DO A LOS

03:03:19.822 --> 03:03:21.023
ANGELES THIS WEEK.

03:03:21.090 --> 03:03:22.324
VIOLENT VOLUNTEER LAWYERS

03:03:22.391 --> 03:03:26.695
VOLUNTEER JUDGES HELP STUDENTS

03:03:26.762 --> 03:03:28.063
PREPARE FOR THE BAR EXAM.

03:03:28.130 --> 03:03:28.897
AND I WAS LISTENING TO THE

03:03:28.964 --> 03:03:29.631
DISCUSSION HERE ABOUT.

03:03:29.698 --> 03:03:30.733
THE CUT SCORE.

03:03:30.799 --> 03:03:32.868
AND PART OF THAT IS.

03:03:32.935 --> 03:03:34.436
GETTING PEOPLE PREPARE THE

03:03:34.503 --> 03:03:36.038
COMING RIGHT OUT OF LAW SCHOOL

03:03:36.105 --> 03:03:37.406
AND ONE OF THE THINGS WE CAN DO

03:03:37.473 --> 03:03:38.674
TO HELP US MAKE SURE THEY GET

03:03:38.741 --> 03:03:40.075
THE PREPARATION COURSES.

03:03:40.142 --> 03:03:41.710
NOT JUST ONCE THEY LEAVE LAW

03:03:41.777 --> 03:03:42.878
SCHOOL.

03:03:42.945 --> 03:03:44.513
BUT I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT THERE

03:03:44.580 --> 03:03:46.382
SHOULD BE A PREPARATION COURSE

03:03:46.448 --> 03:03:46.915
AS PART OF THE LAW SCHOOL

03:03:46.982 --> 03:03:48.417
CURRICULA.

03:03:48.484 --> 03:03:49.985
MAYBE THAT THIRD YEAR LAST

03:03:50.052 --> 03:03:51.754
SEMESTER SOME KIND OF BAR

03:03:51.820 --> 03:03:53.622
PREPARATION COURSE TO GET

03:03:53.689 --> 03:03:54.523
STUDENTS READY.

03:03:54.590 --> 03:03:57.626
AND AGAIN THE FINANCIAL ASPECT

03:03:57.693 --> 03:03:59.795
MONEY TO PAY FOR THESE PROGRAMS

03:03:59.862 --> 03:04:02.064
THE PAY FOR THE BAR EXAM TO PAY

03:04:02.131 --> 03:04:02.965
FOR REPEAT COURSE.

03:04:03.031 --> 03:04:05.200
IT'S A TWO DAY EXAM TO PAY FOR A

03:04:05.267 --> 03:04:06.969
HOTEL SUITE YOU CAN TAKE WITH

03:04:07.035 --> 03:04:08.837
THEM AND BE FRESH IN THE MORNING

03:04:08.904 --> 03:04:11.173
WHEN YOU GET THERE FOR SIX HOURS

03:04:11.240 --> 03:04:12.341
OF TESTING EACH DAY.

03:04:12.408 --> 03:04:13.075
THOSE KINDS OF THINGS ARE

03:04:13.142 --> 03:04:14.810
IMPORTANT.

03:04:14.877 --> 03:04:17.246
SO AS AS I LOOK AT DIVERSITY I'M

03:04:17.312 --> 03:04:19.481
VERY PROUD OF WHAT.

03:04:19.548 --> 03:04:21.650
CHIEF JUSTICE IS DONE.

03:04:21.717 --> 03:04:23.118
I MEAN SHE SEVEN AND MEN'S

03:04:23.185 --> 03:04:24.953
COMMITMENT TO DIVERSITY -- YOU

03:04:25.020 --> 03:04:25.821
LOOK AT THE MAKE UP OF THE

03:04:25.888 --> 03:04:27.456
JUDICIAL COUNTY LOOK AT THE MAKE

03:04:27.523 --> 03:04:31.026
UP OF THE ADVISORY COMMITTEES

03:04:31.093 --> 03:04:33.495
WELL WE SEE INCLUSION THERE AND

03:04:33.562 --> 03:04:34.997
IT'S AN EFFORT THAT CONTINUES.

03:04:35.063 --> 03:04:37.065
AND A LOT OF IT HAS TO COM FROM

03:04:37.132 --> 03:04:38.967
COURT LEADERSHIP.

03:04:39.034 --> 03:04:40.068
WE HAVE TO STEP UP.

03:04:40.135 --> 03:04:42.704
AND UNFORTUNATELY BEING THE ONLY

03:04:42.771 --> 03:04:43.572
ONE OF THE FEW AFRICAN AMERICAN

03:04:43.639 --> 03:04:44.907
PRESIDING JUDGES OUT OF THE

03:04:44.973 --> 03:04:46.542
FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES.

03:04:46.608 --> 03:04:49.111
I HAVE A LITTLE INFLUENCE IN LA

03:04:49.178 --> 03:04:50.412
BUT NOT AS MUCH STATEWIDE.

03:04:50.479 --> 03:04:53.449
OKAY SO I TRY TO FOCUS ON THAT.

03:04:53.515 --> 03:04:55.317
AND MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE WHAT

03:04:55.384 --> 03:04:57.119
WE CALL INCLUSION AND DIVERSITY

03:04:57.186 --> 03:05:00.155
SO IT'S IT'S AN IMPORTANT JOB.

03:05:00.222 --> 03:05:02.524
THE COUNCIL I KNOW IS COMMITTED

03:05:02.591 --> 03:05:04.193
TO MAKING SURE WE HAVE DIVERSITY

03:05:04.259 --> 03:05:05.928
WE'VE GOT PROGRAMS IN PLACE --

03:05:05.994 --> 03:05:06.995
TALKED ABOUT THE JUSTICE CORPS

03:05:07.062 --> 03:05:08.764
PROGRAM WE ALSO HAVE INTERNSHIP

03:05:08.831 --> 03:05:09.865
PROGRAMS THE ONLY WHO THE

03:05:09.932 --> 03:05:10.999
COUNCIL BUT THROUGH.

03:05:11.066 --> 03:05:12.734
SOME OF THE VARIOUS COURTS THAT

03:05:12.801 --> 03:05:14.169
THE CHIEF STRONGLY SUPPORTS AND

03:05:14.236 --> 03:05:15.904
I KNOW THE BARS IS VERY VERY

03:05:15.971 --> 03:05:17.206
IMPORTANT.

03:05:17.272 --> 03:05:17.973
I KNOW THAT WE HAVE THE

03:05:18.040 --> 03:05:19.408
CALIFORNIA LAWYERS ASSOCIATION

03:05:19.475 --> 03:05:21.643
WHICH HAS A ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND

03:05:21.710 --> 03:05:22.110
MEMBERS.

03:05:22.177 --> 03:05:23.645
AS WELL CALIFORNIA JUDGES

03:05:23.712 --> 03:05:25.214
ASSOCIATION THEY'RE COMMITTED TO

03:05:25.280 --> 03:05:26.782
WORKING WITH -- DIVERSITY

03:05:26.849 --> 03:05:28.083
PROGRAMS IN TERMS OF JUDICIAL

03:05:28.150 --> 03:05:28.884
SUMMITS.

03:05:28.951 --> 03:05:31.720
AND MAKING SURE THAT WE CAN.

03:05:31.787 --> 03:05:35.257
HAVE LAWYERS AND JUDGES ENGAGED

03:05:35.324 --> 03:05:36.225
IN THE RECRUITMENT PROCESS.

03:05:36.291 --> 03:05:37.059
BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

03:05:37.125 --> 03:05:38.727
WE HAVE TO REALIZE IS THAT ONCE

03:05:38.794 --> 03:05:41.163
A MINORITY BECOMES A JUDGE.

03:05:41.230 --> 03:05:42.297
THEN THERE'S ALWAYS THE PROBLEM

03:05:42.364 --> 03:05:43.866
OF RETENTION.

03:05:43.932 --> 03:05:45.334
BECAUSE OFTEN TIMES WHEN AS A

03:05:45.400 --> 03:05:46.668
JUDICIAL ELECTION WHICH HAPPENS

03:05:46.735 --> 03:05:49.037
EVERY SIX YEARS MINORITY JUDGES

03:05:49.104 --> 03:05:50.739
USUALLY DRAW CHALLENGE IN THOSE

03:05:50.806 --> 03:05:51.974
COUNTIES WHERE THEY DON'T HAVE A

03:05:52.040 --> 03:05:53.275
LARGE NUMBER OF MINORITY.

03:05:53.342 --> 03:05:55.878
RESIDENTS SO WE HAVE TO LOOK OUT

03:05:55.944 --> 03:05:56.678
FOR THAT IN THERE IT'S ALL ABOUT

03:05:56.745 --> 03:05:58.547
MONEY FOR JUDICIAL ELECTIONS

03:05:58.614 --> 03:05:59.681
INJURES RETENTION.

03:05:59.748 --> 03:06:01.383
BUT THAT'S A REAL PROBLEM THAT

03:06:01.450 --> 03:06:03.385
SOMETIMES GETS OVERLOOKED AS

03:06:03.452 --> 03:06:03.952
WELL ONCE WE GET THEM ON THE

03:06:04.019 --> 03:06:05.387
BENCH.

03:06:05.454 --> 03:06:06.722
WE GOT TO KEEP THEM ON THE BENCH.

03:06:06.788 --> 03:06:08.557
AND OFTENTIMES THAT VERY FIRST

03:06:08.624 --> 03:06:09.424
TIME UP.

03:06:09.491 --> 03:06:10.893
MINORITY CANDIDATE WILL FACE AN

03:06:10.959 --> 03:06:16.865
ELECTION CHALLENGE.

03:06:16.932 --> 03:06:18.834
SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE

03:06:18.901 --> 03:06:20.202
DOING SOMETHING ABOUT THAT.

03:06:20.269 --> 03:06:22.337
AND I KNOW THE COUNCIL THAT'S A

03:06:22.404 --> 03:06:23.739
CONCERN OF THE COUNCIL.

03:06:23.805 --> 03:06:25.407
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE

03:06:25.474 --> 03:06:27.042
DONE IN LOS ANGELES IS IS WE'VE

03:06:27.109 --> 03:06:29.578
STARTED A A PACK FOR THE JUDGES --

03:06:29.645 --> 03:06:32.147
TO HELP THEM FINANCE -- THEIR

03:06:32.214 --> 03:06:34.850
CAMPAIGNS WHERE THE JUDGES MAKE.

03:06:34.917 --> 03:06:36.585
MONTHLY CONTRIBUTIONS.

03:06:36.652 --> 03:06:38.987
ARE THE CJ ALSO HAS A PET.

03:06:39.054 --> 03:06:40.088
DACHSHUND SAME WAY.

03:06:40.155 --> 03:06:41.356
SO.

03:06:41.423 --> 03:06:44.326
I FINALLY FIGURED OUT THAT'S

03:06:44.393 --> 03:06:45.060
WHAT THAT MEANS LIKE.

03:06:45.127 --> 03:06:50.098
A A SUBTLE REMINDER OKAY THAT'S

03:06:50.165 --> 03:06:51.767
WHAT THAT MEANS.

03:06:51.833 --> 03:06:53.468
ALL RIGHT I'M A LITTLE SLOW BUT

03:06:53.535 --> 03:06:54.403
GONNA FINALLY GOT IT.

03:06:54.469 --> 03:06:55.904

03:07:02.110 --> 03:07:03.545
IMPORTANT.

03:07:03.612 --> 03:07:04.913

WE HAVE TO TAKE A LEADERSHIP

03:07:16.358 --> 03:07:18.060

03:07:24.499 --> 03:07:26.134
THAT THAT IS ALWAYS BOTHER ME A

03:07:26.201 --> 03:07:27.536
LITTLE BIT ANY BRING IT UP WITH

03:07:27.603 --> 03:07:29.438
THE OTHER PAN AROUND TESTING.

03:07:29.504 --> 03:07:31.173
BUT SINCE YOU HAD BROUGHT IT UP.

03:07:31.239 --> 03:07:33.008
THIS NOTION OF MAYBE ASKING THE

03:07:33.075 --> 03:07:34.910
LAW SCHOOLS TO TEACH THAT TO

03:07:34.977 --> 03:07:36.378
PREP FOR THE BAR EXAM WHICH I'M

03:07:36.445 --> 03:07:37.646
NOT.

03:07:37.713 --> 03:07:39.247
ACTUALLY ADVOCATING BECAUSE I

03:07:39.314 --> 03:07:40.082
THINK THAT WOULD BE A MISTAKE IF

03:07:40.148 --> 03:07:42.184
WE SET UP AN EDUCATION SYSTEM TO

03:07:42.250 --> 03:07:43.619
TEACH TO A TEST I I THINK THAT'S

03:07:43.685 --> 03:07:45.120
A MISTAKE.

03:07:45.187 --> 03:07:46.555
BUT WE HAVE THIS INDUSTRY THAT

03:07:46.622 --> 03:07:48.290
WAS CREATED AROUND BAR SCHOOL

03:07:48.357 --> 03:07:49.691
PREP COURSES.

03:07:49.758 --> 03:07:51.727
AND IT IT'S BECOME.

03:07:51.793 --> 03:07:54.596
NECESSARY TO DO A PREP COURSE

03:07:54.663 --> 03:07:56.031
AND EVERY STUDENT GOES THROUGH

03:07:56.098 --> 03:07:57.466
IT AND AND IT SORT OF BECOMES

03:07:57.532 --> 03:07:58.266
PART OF THE LOWER.

03:07:58.333 --> 03:08:00.235
EVEN.

03:08:00.302 --> 03:08:01.336
UNDER YEARS AGO WHEN I WENT

03:08:01.403 --> 03:08:02.537
THROUGH LAW SCHOOL SO.

03:08:02.604 --> 03:08:04.106
THAT THE LOWER ABOUT WHAT YOU

03:08:04.172 --> 03:08:06.141
HAVE TO DO AND ALL.

03:08:06.208 --> 03:08:07.843
BUT IT WHY.

03:08:07.909 --> 03:08:10.545
BECAUSE IF THE IF THE BAR EXAM

03:08:10.612 --> 03:08:15.083
WERE TESTING ON COMPETENCE. FOR

03:08:15.150 --> 03:08:16.618
SOMEBODY IS COMING OUT OF LAW

03:08:16.685 --> 03:08:18.420
SCHOOL OR WHO HAD BEEN.

03:08:18.487 --> 03:08:20.055
PRACTICING IN ANOTHER STATE OR

03:08:20.122 --> 03:08:22.424
WHO HAD GONE THROUGH INSTEAD OF

03:08:22.491 --> 03:08:24.159
GOING TO LAW SCHOOL BUT HAD.

03:08:24.226 --> 03:08:27.129
HAD IN IN TURN DOOR OR WORKED

03:08:27.195 --> 03:08:28.497
WITH A AS THE CALIFORNIA LAW.

03:08:28.563 --> 03:08:30.732
CURRENTLY ALLOWS BUT I DON'T

03:08:30.799 --> 03:08:31.366
KNOW ANYBODY'S REALLY DUMB THIS

03:08:31.433 --> 03:08:33.635
RECENTLY. TO BE WORK FOR AN

03:08:33.702 --> 03:08:34.770
ATTORNEY AND AND AND TO GET

03:08:34.836 --> 03:08:36.571
PRATT'S [inaudible]

03:08:36.638 --> 03:08:39.307
THAT PREPARATION.

03:08:39.374 --> 03:08:41.877
THE EXAM SHOULD BE A COMBINATION

03:08:41.943 --> 03:08:44.112
OF THAT PREPARATION RATHER THAN

03:08:44.179 --> 03:08:46.314
SOMETHING THAT STANDS ON ITS OWN

03:08:46.381 --> 03:08:47.115
AND I CAN REMEMBER BACK

03:08:47.182 --> 03:08:47.416
[inaudible]

03:08:47.482 --> 03:08:49.685
THAT.

03:08:49.751 --> 03:08:51.687
SOMEBODY HAD TALKED WILLOWS LAW

03:08:51.753 --> 03:08:53.889
SCHOOL THAT THAT WE LEARNED.

03:08:53.955 --> 03:08:54.489
THREE DIFFERENT DISTINCT TYPES

03:08:54.556 --> 03:08:55.557
OF LAW.

03:08:55.624 --> 03:08:56.992
THAT HAVE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO

03:08:57.059 --> 03:08:59.161
DO WITH EACH OTHER THE FIRST IS

03:08:59.227 --> 03:09:00.128
WHAT YOU LEARN IN LAW SCHOOL.

03:09:00.195 --> 03:09:01.463
AND THE SECOND IS WHAT YOU LEARN

03:09:01.530 --> 03:09:03.298
FOR THE BAR EXAM AND THE THIRD

03:09:03.365 --> 03:09:03.865
IS WHAT YOU LEARN WHEN YOU

03:09:03.932 --> 03:09:05.000
PRACTICE.

03:09:05.067 --> 03:09:06.935
AND THERE'S NO IN RELATION

03:09:07.002 --> 03:09:09.071
BETWEEN ANY OF THOSE.

03:09:09.137 --> 03:09:10.706
A BIT OF A JOKE BUT YET SOME

03:09:10.772 --> 03:09:11.807
REAL AND THAT'S UNDERSCORED BY

03:09:11.873 --> 03:09:13.575
YOUR STATEMENT ABOUT HAVING TO

03:09:13.642 --> 03:09:15.444
TAKE THESE PREP EXAMS TO TO BE

03:09:15.510 --> 03:09:16.511
ABLE TO BE.

03:09:16.578 --> 03:09:19.347
SUCCESSFUL AT TAKING THE BAR.

03:09:19.414 --> 03:09:21.450
EXAM SO DOESN'T THAT MEAN THAT

03:09:21.516 --> 03:09:24.352
THE BAR EXAM ITSELF.

03:09:24.419 --> 03:09:27.055
DOESN'T RELATE TO THE STUDY'S TO

03:09:27.122 --> 03:09:29.958
THE PREPARATION THAT FOLKS HAVE

03:09:30.025 --> 03:09:32.594
GONE THROUGH A WOULD. THIRTY

03:09:32.661 --> 03:09:33.161
SEVEN START IF I MAY ADDRESS

03:09:33.228 --> 03:09:34.730
THAT GAP QUESTION BECAUSE THE

03:09:34.796 --> 03:09:36.398
BAR ACTUALLY IS UNDERTAKEN RIGHT

03:09:36.465 --> 03:09:38.967
NOW A PRACTICE ANALYSIS I MEAN

03:09:39.034 --> 03:09:40.469
YOU ASK EXACTLY THE RIGHT

03:09:40.535 --> 03:09:43.238
QUESTION IS THE BAR EXAM TESTING.

03:09:43.305 --> 03:09:44.673
FOR WHAT PEOPLE ACTUALLY NEED TO

03:09:44.740 --> 03:09:47.342
KNOW TO BE MINIMALLY COMPETENT

03:09:47.409 --> 03:09:48.844
LAWYERS ENTERING THE PROFESSION.

03:09:48.910 --> 03:09:50.178
AND TO THE STATE BAR RIGHT NOW

03:09:50.245 --> 03:09:51.947
IS UNDERGOING AN ANALYSIS UP

03:09:52.013 --> 03:09:54.049
WHAT ARE THE SKILLS THAT A FIRST

03:09:54.116 --> 03:09:55.684
YEAR ATTORNEY NEEDS TO KNOW.

03:09:55.751 --> 03:09:57.452
RIGHT I MEAN I CAN TELL YOU AS A

03:09:57.519 --> 03:09:59.154
PARTNER IN A LAW FIRM WE HAVE

03:09:59.221 --> 03:10:00.756
ASSOCIATES COMING IN THE DOOR OF

03:10:00.822 --> 03:10:01.823
OUR VERY LEE LAW FIRM.

03:10:01.890 --> 03:10:05.527
WHO HAVE NEVER LEARNED HOW TO

03:10:05.594 --> 03:10:06.628
DRAFT THE DECLARATION?

03:10:06.695 --> 03:10:07.629
RIGHT BUT YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE

03:10:07.696 --> 03:10:08.330
PRACTICING LAWYER THAT IS ONE OF

03:10:08.396 --> 03:10:09.664
THE FIRST THINGS YOU REALLY NEED

03:10:09.731 --> 03:10:10.665
TO KNOW HOW TO DO.

03:10:10.732 --> 03:10:12.868
I AM SO THAT STUDY IS GOING TO

03:10:12.934 --> 03:10:15.504
BE HUGELY USEFUL TO LOOKING AT

03:10:15.570 --> 03:10:17.839
WHETHER WE NEED TO RECONSTITUTE

03:10:17.906 --> 03:10:20.142
THE BAR EXAM TO REALLY ADDRESS

03:10:20.208 --> 03:10:22.444
THOSE SKILLS THAT PEOPLE NEED IN

03:10:22.511 --> 03:10:23.411
THEIR FIRST YEAR.

03:10:23.478 --> 03:10:25.580
OTHERWISE ANY GOOD PARALEGAL --

03:10:25.647 --> 03:10:27.482
LEGAL SECRETARY COULD PROBABLY

03:10:27.549 --> 03:10:29.284
SIT DOWN AND TAKE THE BAR.

03:10:29.351 --> 03:10:30.619
BECAUSE OF THE THE PRACTICAL

03:10:30.685 --> 03:10:32.053
ASPECT IN IN THE FIRST YEAR LAW

03:10:32.120 --> 03:10:33.889
STUDENT.

03:10:33.955 --> 03:10:35.423
IF THEY DON'T QUICKLY MAKE

03:10:35.490 --> 03:10:38.126
FRIENDS WITH THE PARALEGALS AND

03:10:38.193 --> 03:10:39.394
LEGAL SECRETARIES WILL READILY

03:10:39.461 --> 03:10:41.196
STRUGGLE THE SECRETARY AT YOU

03:10:41.263 --> 03:10:43.198
KNOW PROPERTIES A BUNDLE OF

03:10:43.265 --> 03:10:43.431
RIGHTS.

03:10:43.498 --> 03:10:45.133
YOU KNOW THAT.

03:10:45.200 --> 03:10:46.568
I THINK IT'S SORT OF A TWO PART

03:10:46.635 --> 03:10:48.003
QUESTION WHICH IS YOU KNOW DOES

03:10:48.069 --> 03:10:49.104
THE BAR EXAM TESTS WHICH YOU

03:10:49.171 --> 03:10:50.839
NEED TO DO TO BE A TO BE A GOOD

03:10:50.906 --> 03:10:51.339
LAWYER.

03:10:51.406 --> 03:10:53.008
THE NEXT QUESTION IS DOES LAW

03:10:53.074 --> 03:10:54.876
SCHOOL PREPARE YOU TO BE A GOOD

03:10:54.943 --> 03:10:55.443
LAWYER.

03:10:55.510 --> 03:10:58.413
AND AND THE STEPS IN BETWEEN AND

03:10:58.480 --> 03:10:59.548
I LOOK FOR EXAMPLE I WENT TO

03:10:59.614 --> 03:11:01.950
BERKELEY AND THEY HAVE IT HAD.

03:11:02.017 --> 03:11:03.418
A TREMENDOUS INCREASE WHEN WHEN

03:11:03.485 --> 03:11:04.653
I WAS IN SCHOOL THERE IS NO SUCH

03:11:04.719 --> 03:11:06.421
THING AS CLINICAL EDUCATION NOW

03:11:06.488 --> 03:11:08.023
IT'S ALL ABOUT THEY HAVE.

03:11:08.089 --> 03:11:10.158
DOZENS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF

03:11:10.225 --> 03:11:11.726
CLINICAL EXPERIENCES THAT YOU

03:11:11.793 --> 03:11:13.628
CAN GO THROUGH ALL OF WHICH ARE

03:11:13.695 --> 03:11:14.229
GOING TO TEACH YOU HOW TO DO A

03:11:14.296 --> 03:11:15.096
DECLARATION.

03:11:15.163 --> 03:11:17.799
SO IT IT TAT BUT IT MADE IT MAY

03:11:17.866 --> 03:11:20.535
OR MAY NOT PREPARE YOU TO TAKE

03:11:20.602 --> 03:11:22.938
THE BAR EXAM I DON'T KNOW.

03:11:23.004 --> 03:11:23.905
YEAH I THINK I DIDN'T AND LAW

03:11:23.972 --> 03:11:25.974
SCHOOLS IT SHOULD BE ALSO

03:11:26.041 --> 03:11:26.408
TEACHING.

03:11:26.474 --> 03:11:27.042
HOW TO THINK HOW TO ANALYZE HOW

03:11:27.108 --> 03:11:28.476
TO DO THOSE KINDS OF IN DEPTH

03:11:28.543 --> 03:11:30.278
THINGS THAT DON'T NECESSARILY

03:11:30.345 --> 03:11:32.547
COME ON THAT'S FINE BUT THEN

03:11:32.614 --> 03:11:34.549
THERE'S THE PRACTICAL ASPECTS OF

03:11:34.616 --> 03:11:36.017
IT IN AND? FOR YOU AS WE HAVE.

03:11:36.084 --> 03:11:36.818
THE AND I WANT TO ANSWER THIS

03:11:36.885 --> 03:11:41.022
BUT ALSO YOUR SCHOOL THING YOU

03:11:41.089 --> 03:11:42.190
MENTIONED WHERE YOUR SCHOOLS ARE.

03:11:42.257 --> 03:11:44.793
YOUR PIPELINE IF YOU WILL OF THE

03:11:44.860 --> 03:11:46.328
INTO RURAL AREAS.

03:11:46.394 --> 03:11:47.996
YES DAD WHERE THERE'S A LACK OF

03:11:48.063 --> 03:11:49.464
ATTORNEYS WHERE THERE IS A LACK

03:11:49.531 --> 03:11:54.936
OF HI A PAID EXPENSIVE LAW FIRMS.

03:11:55.003 --> 03:11:57.505
SO WE A LOT OF THE THE STUDENTS

03:11:57.572 --> 03:11:59.407
THAT YOU TEACH THEN GO OUT INTO

03:11:59.474 --> 03:12:00.976
AREAS THAT ARE PROBABLY

03:12:01.042 --> 03:12:02.177
UNDERSERVED BY NUMBERS OF

03:12:02.244 --> 03:12:03.678
LAWYERS.

03:12:03.745 --> 03:12:05.513
THAT HAVE TO BE COME OUT OF

03:12:05.580 --> 03:12:07.816
SCHOOL READ THE TACKLE ALL HOST

03:12:07.883 --> 03:12:09.818
OF DIFFERENT THINGS BECAUSE ONCE

03:12:09.885 --> 03:12:11.152
YOU PASSED THE BAR EXAM.

03:12:11.219 --> 03:12:13.255
WERE QUALIFIED TO DO LOTS OF

03:12:13.321 --> 03:12:14.789
THINGS WHICH IS THE PROMISES I

03:12:14.856 --> 03:12:16.458
WOULD SERIOUSLY QUESTION.

03:12:16.524 --> 03:12:18.660
BUT TECHNICALLY QUALIFIED TO DO

03:12:18.727 --> 03:12:20.195
A LOT OF THINGS RIGHT SO HOW DO

03:12:20.262 --> 03:12:21.263
YOU PREPARE YOUR STUDENTS THAN

03:12:21.329 --> 03:12:22.898
THIS PIPELINE TO GO OUTINTO

03:12:22.964 --> 03:12:24.766
THESE RURAL COMMUNITIES.

03:12:24.833 --> 03:12:27.369
AND TO BE EFFECTIVE SO THE GOOD

03:12:27.435 --> 03:12:28.937
THE GOOD NEWS IS AS LEGAL

03:12:29.004 --> 03:12:30.505
EDUCATION IS INVOLVING.

03:12:30.572 --> 03:12:32.774
I DON'T THINK IT'S UNREALISTIC

03:12:32.841 --> 03:12:34.843
TO EXPECT BELOW IN THE COURSE OF

03:12:34.910 --> 03:12:36.645
A LARGER DEGREE TO DO ABSOLUTELY

03:12:36.711 --> 03:12:38.179
EVERYTHING WE'VE JUST DISCUSSED

03:12:38.246 --> 03:12:38.813
HERE.

03:12:38.880 --> 03:12:39.948
THERE'S THERE'S NO REASON WE

03:12:40.015 --> 03:12:42.017
CAN'T INTEGRATE ADDITIONAL

03:12:42.083 --> 03:12:43.251
CLINICAL TRAINING.

03:12:43.318 --> 03:12:44.753
WE'VE BEEN DOING IT FOR OVER A

03:12:44.819 --> 03:12:47.255
DECADE IT WORKS VERY WELL I

03:12:47.322 --> 03:12:48.423
THINK ALL OF THE MAJOR LAW

03:12:48.490 --> 03:12:50.225
SCHOOL ALL LAW SCHOOLS I BELIEVE

03:12:50.292 --> 03:12:51.493
OF INTEGRATED MORE CLINICAL

03:12:51.559 --> 03:12:52.827
TRAINING BECAUSE WE'RE LISTENING

03:12:52.894 --> 03:12:53.862
TO THE BENCH IN THE BAR.

03:12:53.929 --> 03:12:56.097
AND AND THE PRACTICING LAWYERS

03:12:56.164 --> 03:12:56.998
WHO SAY THIS WHAT WE WANT THEM

03:12:57.065 --> 03:12:57.966
TO DO.

03:12:58.033 --> 03:12:59.534
IT THE SKILLS TO PASS THE BAR

03:12:59.601 --> 03:13:02.437
EXAMINER TO EXCLUSIVE TO

03:13:02.504 --> 03:13:03.905
ANALYTICAL REASONING READING

03:13:03.972 --> 03:13:06.141
COMPREHENSION WRITING THESE ARE

03:13:06.207 --> 03:13:07.442
THE SAME THINGS WE DO IS LAWYERS.

03:13:07.509 --> 03:13:09.077
IT MAY NOT BE IN EXACTLY THE

03:13:09.144 --> 03:13:11.846
SAME FORMAT AS THE BAR EXAM.

03:13:11.913 --> 03:13:14.316
IT IS UNUSUAL THAT WE'VE NOW

03:13:14.382 --> 03:13:16.985
HAVE 50% OF THE CALIFORNIA BAR

03:13:17.052 --> 03:13:18.853
EXAM THAT OUR MBT QUESTIONS THAT

03:13:18.920 --> 03:13:21.356
HAVE NO RELATION TO THE PRACTICE

03:13:21.423 --> 03:13:22.624
OF LAW WHATSOEVER.

03:13:22.691 --> 03:13:24.092
BUT THE ESSAY EXAMS IN THE

03:13:24.159 --> 03:13:26.761
PERFORMANCE EXAMS ARE ARE NOT.

03:13:26.828 --> 03:13:28.463
A NOT FUNCTIONALLY UNLIKE THE

03:13:28.530 --> 03:13:30.165
WAY WE PRACTICE LAW.

03:13:30.231 --> 03:13:35.036
IN THE DAY TO IDENTIFY ISSUES ON

03:13:35.103 --> 03:13:36.671
OF THE RULES.

03:13:36.738 --> 03:13:37.572
DO THE ANALYSIS AND AND DRAFT A

03:13:37.639 --> 03:13:37.872
CONCLUSION.

03:13:37.939 --> 03:13:39.441
SO I THINK IT IS REALISTIC TO

03:13:39.507 --> 03:13:42.010
EXPECT US AND TO DEMAND.

03:13:42.077 --> 03:13:43.945
US AS LEGAL EDUCATORS TO BE ABLE

03:13:44.012 --> 03:13:45.547

WITHIN THE CURRICULUM THAT WE

SIXTEEN THERE WERE A NUMBER OF

03:14:02.931 --> 03:14:04.265
STUDIES THAT REPORTED THAT

03:14:04.332 --> 03:14:05.066
SHOWED.

03:14:05.133 --> 03:14:06.835
THAT THE MAJORITY OF THOSE

03:14:06.901 --> 03:14:08.636
SERVING THE RURAL COMMUNITIES OF

03:14:08.703 --> 03:14:11.406

EIGHTEEN BAR EXAM.

03:14:30.792 --> 03:14:32.794
BEING MINORITIES COMING FROM

03:14:32.861 --> 03:14:34.829
THOSE COMMUNITIES INTERESTED IN

03:14:34.896 --> 03:14:36.097
GOING BACK INTO THOSE

03:14:36.164 --> 03:14:38.333
COMMUNITIES AND YET HAVING THE

03:14:38.400 --> 03:14:40.135
BARRIER OF THE FOURTEEN FORTY

03:14:40.201 --> 03:14:41.636
STAND IN THEIR WAY OF GOING OUT

03:14:41.703 --> 03:14:42.737
SERVING THOSE COMMUNITIES AS

03:14:42.804 --> 03:14:43.238
LAWYERS.

03:14:43.304 --> 03:14:45.273
FORTUNATELY MANY OF THEM STILL

03:14:45.340 --> 03:14:46.775
SERVE THOSE COMMUNITIES THEY'RE

03:14:46.841 --> 03:14:48.643
JUST THEY'RE EFFORTS ARE BLUNTED

03:14:48.710 --> 03:14:51.279
BY NOT BEING ABLE TO DO IT AS A

03:14:51.346 --> 03:14:52.347
LAWYER.

03:14:52.414 --> 03:14:52.981
AND IF I COULD JUST ADD ON THAT

03:14:53.048 --> 03:14:53.948
POINT ABOUT THE NEED FOR RURAL

SERVING ATTORNEYS IT IS A MAJOR

03:14:55.750 --> 03:14:57.719
PROBLEM IT IS SOMETHING THAT THE

LEGALLY COMMUNITIES LOOKING

03:14:59.254 --> 03:15:00.755

SO THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE

03:15:06.761 --> 03:15:08.296
BREAKING THROUGH THE BARRIERS

03:15:08.363 --> 03:15:11.132
AND DEFYING THE ODDS BUT ONE BIG

03:15:11.199 --> 03:15:13.435
CHALLENGE RELATES TO THE COST OF

ATTORNEY IT IS A TREMENDOUS

03:15:19.074 --> 03:15:20.909
CHALLENGE AND A COLLEAGUE IN THE

AUDIENCE SELENA COPELAND FROM

03:15:22.143 --> 03:15:23.278
THE LEGAL AID ASSOCIATION

CALIFORNIA'S LOOKING AT HOW WE

03:15:25.280 --> 03:15:26.714
CAN INCREASE THE PIPELINE AS

03:15:26.781 --> 03:15:28.083
WELL AS OUR ORGANIZATION.

03:15:28.149 --> 03:15:29.984
OF ATTORNEYS WHO WILL SERVE THE

03:15:30.051 --> 03:15:31.386
COMMUNITY.

03:15:31.453 --> 03:15:32.921
IN THE MORE REMOTE PARTS OF THE

03:15:32.987 --> 03:15:34.489
STATE WHERE THE ACCESS TO

03:15:34.556 --> 03:15:36.224
JUSTICE ISSUE IS EXTREMELY

03:15:36.291 --> 03:15:38.426
PROFOUND. ONE THING I JUST WANT

03:15:38.493 --> 03:15:40.328
TO TACK ON SINCE I'M TALKING

03:15:40.395 --> 03:15:40.829
ABOUT.

03:15:40.895 --> 03:15:43.264
LEGAL AID ATTORNEYS IS THAT I

03:15:43.331 --> 03:15:44.799
MEAN WE SHOULD THE THE BAR

03:15:44.866 --> 03:15:46.601
PROVIDED INFORMATION IN THEIR

03:15:46.668 --> 03:15:47.969
MARCH FIFTEENTH REPORT TO THIS

03:15:48.036 --> 03:15:50.939
COMMITTEE ABOUT THE DIVERSITY OF

03:15:51.005 --> 03:15:52.607
NONPROFIT ATTORNEYS AND I JUST

03:15:52.674 --> 03:15:53.842
WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT THAT.

03:15:53.908 --> 03:15:56.277
ALMOST TWO THIRDS OF NONPROFIT

03:15:56.344 --> 03:15:58.413
ATTORNEYS ARE WOMEN AND SO IT IS

03:15:58.480 --> 03:15:59.881
AN AREA OF THE LAW WHERE THERE

03:15:59.948 --> 03:16:03.051
HAS BEEN A GREAT STRIDES -- AND

03:16:03.118 --> 03:16:04.385
AT THE SAME TIME.

03:16:04.452 --> 03:16:05.653
ONLY ABOUT ONE THIRD OF THOSE

03:16:05.720 --> 03:16:07.589
ATTORNEYS WHO ARE WORKING IN

03:16:07.655 --> 03:16:09.757
LEGAL AID -- ARE PEOPLE OF COLOR

03:16:09.824 --> 03:16:12.060
ATTORNEYS OF COLOUR SO WHILE

03:16:12.127 --> 03:16:13.561
THERE IS GREAT STRIDES AND I

03:16:13.628 --> 03:16:14.929
THINK THERE ARE LESSONS TO LEARN

03:16:14.996 --> 03:16:16.965
FROM THE LEGALLY COMMUNITY ABOUT

03:16:17.031 --> 03:16:18.133
INCREASING DIVERSITY IN THE

03:16:18.199 --> 03:16:19.400
PROFESSION OVERALL.

03:16:19.467 --> 03:16:20.602
IN ITS LOOKING AT THE THINGS

03:16:20.668 --> 03:16:22.003
THAT I HAD MENTIONED ABOUT

03:16:22.070 --> 03:16:26.441
CREATING.

03:16:26.508 --> 03:16:27.175
ORGANIZATIONS THAT.

03:16:27.242 --> 03:16:28.209
YOU CAN REALLY GET A LOT OF JOB

03:16:28.276 --> 03:16:29.611
SATISFACTION -- WHERE YOU CAN

03:16:29.677 --> 03:16:31.112
YOU KNOW FOR FILLED THE YOU KNOW

03:16:31.179 --> 03:16:32.413
THE PURPOSE THAT YOU CAME TO LAW

03:16:32.480 --> 03:16:33.748
SCHOOL IN IN IN THE VERY

03:16:33.815 --> 03:16:35.783
BEGINNING? TO TO DO LIKE -- MISS

03:16:35.850 --> 03:16:36.951
PROGRESS THE SAID WHEN SHE

03:16:37.018 --> 03:16:38.419
TESTIFIED SHE WANTS TO SERVE HER

03:16:38.486 --> 03:16:41.122
COMMUNITY SO WE NEED TO LOOK.

03:16:41.189 --> 03:16:43.191
LONGITUDE EARLY AT THE PIPELINE

03:16:43.258 --> 03:16:44.659
FROM THE VERY BEGINNING TO

03:16:44.726 --> 03:16:45.860
GETTING ATTORNEYS WHERE THEY

03:16:45.927 --> 03:16:48.029
NEED TO BE TO ADDRESS THE

03:16:48.096 --> 03:16:50.198
JUSTICE GAP -- BUT LOOKING AT

03:16:50.265 --> 03:16:51.599
SOME OF THE SUCCESS OF THE NO

03:16:51.666 --> 03:16:53.568
LEGALLY COMMUNITY.

03:16:53.635 --> 03:16:54.135
I THINK IT'S A GOOD PLACE TO

03:16:54.202 --> 03:16:55.670
START.

03:16:55.737 --> 03:16:57.071
SO DO WE HAVE TOO MANY ATTORNEYS

03:16:57.138 --> 03:16:59.574
IN CALIFORNIA.

03:16:59.641 --> 03:17:00.975
IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE LEGALLY

03:17:01.042 --> 03:17:03.411
COMMUNITY THERE IS A DRASTIC

03:17:03.478 --> 03:17:04.812
NEED FOR MORE ATTORNEYS

03:17:04.879 --> 03:17:05.980
ABSOLUTELY THE NUMBER OF

03:17:06.047 --> 03:17:08.116
INDIGENT CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE IN

03:17:08.183 --> 03:17:09.651
FACT MAJORITY PEOPLE OF COLOR

03:17:09.717 --> 03:17:11.519
MORE THAN 60% ACCORDING TO THE

03:17:11.586 --> 03:17:12.554
CENSUS.

03:17:12.620 --> 03:17:14.622
OF PEOPLE WHO ARE IN POVERTY IN

NEED A LAWYER ARE PEOPLE OF

03:17:16.391 --> 03:17:17.492
COLOR AND SO WE DO YOU

03:17:17.559 --> 03:17:19.127
DRASTICALLY NEED MORE ATTORNEYS

OF COLOUR MORE DIVERSE ATTORNEYS

03:17:21.462 --> 03:17:22.697
TO BE SERVING AND ITCHING

03:17:22.764 --> 03:17:24.465
CALIFORNIANS THE THE STATISTICS

03:17:24.532 --> 03:17:25.600
I DON'T HAVE THE THE NUMBER BUT

03:17:25.667 --> 03:17:27.202
IT'S THOUSANDS.

03:17:27.268 --> 03:17:28.236
TO ONE OF ATTORNEYS.

03:17:28.303 --> 03:17:30.638
OF PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA WHO NEED

03:17:30.705 --> 03:17:34.209
LAWYERS -- COMPARED TO THE

03:17:34.275 --> 03:17:34.842
NUMBER OF ATTORNEYS AVAILABLE TO

03:17:34.909 --> 03:17:35.443
SERVE THEM.

03:17:35.510 --> 03:17:36.344
NO QUESTION ABOUT IT IN THE

03:17:36.411 --> 03:17:37.845
RURAL COMMUNITIES AND IN THE

03:17:37.912 --> 03:17:40.181
INNER CITIES IN EVERY.

03:17:40.248 --> 03:17:41.783
AREA OF CALIFORNIA WHERE THERE

03:17:41.849 --> 03:17:43.484
UNDERSERVED UNDER REPRESENTED

03:17:43.551 --> 03:17:45.553
POPULATIONS THERE UNDERSERVED

03:17:45.620 --> 03:17:47.088
AND DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THE

03:17:47.155 --> 03:17:49.991
JUSTICE SYSTEM AT THE SAME RATIO

03:17:50.058 --> 03:17:50.625
THAT OTHERS DO.

03:17:50.692 --> 03:17:52.727
AND QUALIFIED LAWYERS ARE NEEDED

03:17:52.794 --> 03:17:56.364
TO SERVE ALL OF THEM WE DO NOT

03:17:56.431 --> 03:17:58.366
HAVE TOO MANY LAWYERS CALIFORNIA.

03:17:58.433 --> 03:17:59.033
IF IF I MAY ADD THAT THE AS THIS

03:17:59.100 --> 03:18:00.802
COULD AS THIS COMMITTEE HAS HAS

03:18:00.868 --> 03:18:01.869
RECOGNIZED.

03:18:01.936 --> 03:18:04.973
WE NEED TO GET GET TO PEOPLE OF

03:18:05.039 --> 03:18:06.407
COLOR PEOPLE OF UNDER UNDER

03:18:06.474 --> 03:18:07.508
REPRESENTED GROUPS INTO

03:18:07.575 --> 03:18:09.077
POSITIONS OF POWER.

03:18:09.143 --> 03:18:11.679
NOT JUST INTO THE PROFESSION BUT

03:18:11.746 --> 03:18:12.880
INTO POSITIONS OF POWER WITHIN

03:18:12.947 --> 03:18:14.582
THE WITHIN THAT PROFESSION SO

03:18:14.649 --> 03:18:16.484
THAT LIKE -- PRESIDING JUDGE

03:18:16.551 --> 03:18:19.387
BRAZIL WE CAN PROVIDE LEADERSHIP

03:18:19.454 --> 03:18:21.556
AND AND BECAUSE THE CHANGE THAT

03:18:21.623 --> 03:18:23.124
WE'RE ALL HOPING TO SEE IN THE

03:18:23.191 --> 03:18:24.292
PROFESSION.

03:18:24.359 --> 03:18:25.426
AND AND THE JUDGE WAS -- YOUR

03:18:25.493 --> 03:18:26.394
DESCRIPTION OF HOW YOU'RE

03:18:26.461 --> 03:18:27.929
CREATING THAT COMMITTEE FOR

03:18:27.996 --> 03:18:29.797
COMMISSIONERS AND ALL IS A CASE

03:18:29.864 --> 03:18:32.634
IN POINT NOT THAT ANOTHER.

03:18:32.700 --> 03:18:33.901
PRESIDING JUDGE WOULD HAVE DONE

03:18:33.968 --> 03:18:35.503
ANYTHING WRONG RIGHT BUT

03:18:35.570 --> 03:18:36.638
DIFFERENTLY.

03:18:36.704 --> 03:18:38.039
AND THIS IS THE OPPORTUNITY THAT

03:18:38.106 --> 03:18:39.607
WE MET RIGHT IN BECAUSE I'M THE

03:18:39.674 --> 03:18:42.176
PRESIDING JUDGE I PICK.

03:18:42.243 --> 03:18:43.344
SO.

03:18:43.411 --> 03:18:44.779
THEREFORE I CAN INSURE THERE'S

03:18:44.846 --> 03:18:46.247
DIVERSITY.

03:18:46.314 --> 03:18:48.950
AND I CAN TALK TO THE JUDGES WHO

03:18:49.017 --> 03:18:50.885
WERE PART OF THAT AGAIN IT GOES --

03:18:50.952 --> 03:18:51.753
TO IMPLICIT BIAS THAT WE ALL

03:18:51.819 --> 03:18:53.454
HAVE.

03:18:53.521 --> 03:18:54.789
THAT THE COUNCIL IS WORKING ON

03:18:54.856 --> 03:18:56.157
WITH IN TERMS OF EDUCATION OF

03:18:56.224 --> 03:18:57.692
THE COURT TO DO THAT.

03:18:57.759 --> 03:19:00.695
BUT WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE.

03:19:00.762 --> 03:19:02.397
THAT WE GET AWAY FROM WELL I

03:19:02.463 --> 03:19:04.299
ONLY PICK PEOPLE WHO LOOK LIKE

03:19:04.365 --> 03:19:06.134
ME OR WHO IS WITH WAS MENTIONED

03:19:06.200 --> 03:19:08.002
EARLIER WHO LOOK LIKE A JUDGE

03:19:08.069 --> 03:19:08.936
NOT SURE WHAT THAT IS.

03:19:09.003 --> 03:19:12.707
BUT FOR ME AND I LOOK AT IT

03:19:12.774 --> 03:19:14.275
BECAUSE I'M IN A POSITION TO

03:19:14.342 --> 03:19:17.312
PICK I CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND

03:19:17.378 --> 03:19:18.246
I WILL.

03:19:18.313 --> 03:19:18.880
RIGHT IN AND THE REASON I ASK A

03:19:18.946 --> 03:19:19.647
QUESTION ABOUT TOO MANY

03:19:19.714 --> 03:19:20.782
ATTORNEYS WAS I DON'T THINK WE

03:19:20.848 --> 03:19:23.084
DO AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT SUPPLY

03:19:23.151 --> 03:19:24.585
AND DEMAND IF WE HAD MORE TERMS

03:19:24.652 --> 03:19:26.621
IF WE HAD THOSE SIX TO EIGHT

03:19:26.688 --> 03:19:28.289
THOUSAND ATTORNEYS.

03:19:28.356 --> 03:19:29.957
MINORITY ATTORNEYS WHO.

03:19:30.024 --> 03:19:32.226
WERE PRACTICING BUT BECAUSE OF

03:19:32.293 --> 03:19:33.361
THAT THE CUT SCORE WE ALSO

03:19:33.428 --> 03:19:34.696
CALIFORNIA DOES NOT HAVE

03:19:34.762 --> 03:19:36.230
RECIPROCITY WITH OTHER STATES.

03:19:36.297 --> 03:19:37.932
WE HOLD OURSELVES SORT OF ABOVE

03:19:37.999 --> 03:19:40.601
AND AND SEPARATE FROM.

03:19:40.668 --> 03:19:43.304
BUT THAT HAS A NARROW THE FIELD.

03:19:43.371 --> 03:19:46.207
AND I THINK IT THAT PUSHES THE

03:19:46.274 --> 03:19:47.508
THE TERM IS THAT WE HAVE TO WHAT

03:19:47.575 --> 03:19:48.976
THOSE HIGH PAYING JOBS IN THE

03:19:49.043 --> 03:19:51.245
BIG LAW FIRMS WHICH IS I THINK

03:19:51.312 --> 03:19:52.280
PART OF THE PROBLEM FOR STARVING

03:19:52.347 --> 03:19:53.981
SOME OF THE RURAL AREAS THAT WE

03:19:54.048 --> 03:19:55.616
NEED TO FOCUS ON THAT.

03:19:55.683 --> 03:19:57.418
SO FOR THE BAR IN FOR JUDICIAL

03:19:57.485 --> 03:19:58.953
COUNCIL AND THERE'S THERE'S

03:19:59.020 --> 03:20:00.488
INTERPLAY BETWEEN THE BAR THE

03:20:00.555 --> 03:20:02.156
JITTERS CANCELS RECORD HAS SOME

03:20:02.223 --> 03:20:04.325
OF THESE AUTHORITIES BUT BUT WHY

03:20:04.392 --> 03:20:06.594
NOT LOWER THE CUT SCORE AND WHY

03:20:06.661 --> 03:20:09.263
DON'T WE HAVE RECIPROCITY WITH

03:20:09.330 --> 03:20:10.965
OTHER STATES [inaudible]

03:20:11.032 --> 03:20:13.434
AND SO WE DID PROVIDE YOU KNOW

03:20:13.501 --> 03:20:16.404
THE BAR PROVIDED A STUDY DONE IN

03:20:16.471 --> 03:20:16.938
TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE

03:20:17.004 --> 03:20:18.306
STANDARD SETTING STUDY I'M WHICH

03:20:18.373 --> 03:20:19.574
DID SHOW THAT IT PROVIDED THE

03:20:19.640 --> 03:20:20.608
SUPREME COURT WITH THE RANGE

03:20:20.675 --> 03:20:22.877
FROM.

03:20:22.944 --> 03:20:23.478
ONE THIRTY EIGHT TO ONE FORTY

03:20:23.544 --> 03:20:24.112
FOUR AM SHOWING THAT THAT WOULD

03:20:24.178 --> 03:20:26.814
SUPPORT MINIMUM COMPETENCY AND

03:20:26.881 --> 03:20:27.348
GAVE THOSE OPTIONS TO THE

03:20:27.415 --> 03:20:28.983
SUPREME COURT.

03:20:29.050 --> 03:20:31.085
AND SO IT'S TIME AT THAT TIME

03:20:31.152 --> 03:20:32.019
THERE WERE A LOT OF OTHER ISSUES

03:20:32.086 --> 03:20:34.188
GOING ON IS TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN

03:20:34.255 --> 03:20:35.089
THE COURT SAID COME BACK AND

03:20:35.156 --> 03:20:36.557
TALK TO THEM AGAIN.

03:20:36.624 --> 03:20:37.458
MY HOPE WOULD BE THAT THE

03:20:37.525 --> 03:20:38.693
CONVERSATION WE'VE HAD HERE

03:20:38.760 --> 03:20:40.228
TODAY HAVING JUSTICE LIEU HERE

03:20:40.294 --> 03:20:41.729
TODAY WAS.

03:20:41.796 --> 03:20:43.998
IMMENSELY VALUABLE -- I BELIEVE

03:20:44.065 --> 03:20:44.732
IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE

03:20:44.799 --> 03:20:46.434
COURT TO OPEN THAT DISCUSSION

03:20:46.501 --> 03:20:48.436
AGAIN AND TO ASK FOR ADDITIONAL

03:20:48.503 --> 03:20:52.106
DATA THAT THE STATE BAR AS

03:20:52.173 --> 03:20:52.473
COMPILING DATA.

03:20:52.540 --> 03:20:53.040
OTHER.

03:20:53.107 --> 03:20:54.108
GROUPS WITHIN THE STATE OF

03:20:54.175 --> 03:20:56.344
COMPILING THE DATA WE NEED THE

03:20:56.411 --> 03:20:57.945
VENUE FOR THE DISCUSSION.

03:20:58.012 --> 03:21:00.114
AND IT IS NOT ONLY HERE IT IS AT

03:21:00.181 --> 03:21:01.949
THE CORE SO HOPEFULLY JUSTICE

03:21:02.016 --> 03:21:04.218
LOSE OPENING THAT DOOR FORCED TO

03:21:04.285 --> 03:21:04.786
HAVE THAT CONVERSATION MORE

03:21:04.852 --> 03:21:05.586
BROADLY.

03:21:05.653 --> 03:21:07.121
AND AND AND THAT'S WHY I ASKED

03:21:07.188 --> 03:21:09.090
THE THE COURTS AS CHIEF JUSTICE

03:21:09.157 --> 03:21:09.991
REMINDS ME THAT SEPARATE

03:21:10.057 --> 03:21:12.660
KHOEKHOE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT

03:21:12.727 --> 03:21:13.094
ABSOLUTE YES WE HAVE

03:21:13.161 --> 03:21:13.394
[inaudible]

03:21:13.461 --> 03:21:14.362
SOME.

03:21:14.429 --> 03:21:16.230
INFLUENCE THERE I WOULD HOPE AS

03:21:16.297 --> 03:21:18.733
THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH BUT I

03:21:18.800 --> 03:21:20.468
DON'T KNOW THAT.

03:21:20.535 --> 03:21:21.736
I THINK THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH

03:21:21.803 --> 03:21:23.137
AND THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH ARE

03:21:23.204 --> 03:21:25.373
USED TO WORKING WITH EACH OTHER

03:21:25.440 --> 03:21:27.141
BUT NOT ALWAYS BETWEEN.

03:21:27.208 --> 03:21:28.176
THE JUDICIAL BRANCH AND THE

03:21:28.242 --> 03:21:29.477
LEGISLATIVE BRANCH AND I AM

03:21:29.544 --> 03:21:30.812
HOPING AND HAVE HAD THIS

03:21:30.878 --> 03:21:31.712
CONVERSATION WITH THE CHIEF

03:21:31.779 --> 03:21:33.014
JUSTICE THAT THAT WE CAN DO A

03:21:33.080 --> 03:21:34.749
BETTER JOB BETWEEN THE BRANCHES

03:21:34.816 --> 03:21:37.218
OF COMMUNICATING UNDERSTANDING.

03:21:37.285 --> 03:21:39.387
PROVIDING INFORMATION AND

03:21:39.454 --> 03:21:41.088
HELPING TO INFLUENCE EACH OTHER

03:21:41.155 --> 03:21:42.924
PROCREATE WITHIN THE SEPARATION

03:21:42.990 --> 03:21:44.158
OF POWERS.

03:21:44.225 --> 03:21:45.760
ON SOME OF THESE DECISION BUT I

03:21:45.827 --> 03:21:47.295
CAN'T SAY NO THE CHEAPEST IS

03:21:47.361 --> 03:21:49.096
GOING TO LISTEN AND SHE'S VERY

03:21:49.163 --> 03:21:50.398
ABSOLUTELY OPERATIVE.

03:21:50.465 --> 03:21:51.466
AND TO WORKING WITH THE

03:21:51.532 --> 03:21:53.067
LEGISLATURE.

03:21:53.134 --> 03:21:54.001
THE BAR GROUPS AND OTHER

03:21:54.068 --> 03:21:55.736
ORGANIZATIONS SHE HAS A VERY

03:21:55.803 --> 03:21:56.804
OPEN MIND.

03:21:56.871 --> 03:21:58.473
SO WE GOT THE RIGHT PERSON AT

03:21:58.539 --> 03:21:59.440
THE HELM TO MAKE SOMETHING

03:21:59.507 --> 03:22:01.409
HAPPEN AND IS IRRITATING AS WE

03:22:01.476 --> 03:22:03.211
CAN BE YES I THINK THAT THAT

03:22:03.277 --> 03:22:04.479
MAKING SURE THAT THAT WE'RE

03:22:04.545 --> 03:22:06.714
BUILDING THOSE OPPORTUNITIES --

03:22:06.781 --> 03:22:08.316
FOR THAT TYLER BUT I I JUST

03:22:08.382 --> 03:22:11.752
SPOKE MINOR POINT OR NOT A MINOR

03:22:11.819 --> 03:22:13.454
POINT BUT AT SMALL MENTION.

03:22:13.521 --> 03:22:14.088
JUDGE WOULD YOU MENTIONED THAT

03:22:14.155 --> 03:22:15.556
THE SECRET COMMITTEES THE

03:22:15.623 --> 03:22:16.123
JUDICIAL SELECTION ADVISORY

03:22:16.190 --> 03:22:17.058
COMMITTEES.

03:22:17.124 --> 03:22:19.160
WHICH HAVE BEEN A GREAT POINT OF

03:22:19.227 --> 03:22:20.695
CONSTERNATION.

03:22:20.761 --> 03:22:22.129
AND I THINK.

03:22:22.196 --> 03:22:24.432
SAM CRITICISM HAD BEEN LEVEL

03:22:24.499 --> 03:22:25.433
THAT -- AND I DON'T KNOW ABOUT

03:22:25.500 --> 03:22:26.534
THE SURVEY RECENTLY BUT I THINK

03:22:26.601 --> 03:22:29.070
OVER TIME PROBABLY SOME TRUTH TO

03:22:29.136 --> 03:22:29.937
IT.

03:22:30.004 --> 03:22:31.572
THAT'D BE COMES A BIT OF A GOOD

03:22:31.639 --> 03:22:33.841
OLD BOYS CLUB AND I THINK WE'VE

03:22:33.908 --> 03:22:36.511
SEEN SOME OF THE RESULTS SINCE

03:22:36.577 --> 03:22:37.912
IT'S PART OF HOW.

03:22:37.979 --> 03:22:39.146
JUDICIAL DECISIONS WERE MADE

03:22:39.213 --> 03:22:40.715
APPOINTMENTS WERE MADE IT'S PART

03:22:40.781 --> 03:22:42.750
OF THAT VETTING TO SOME EXTENT.

03:22:42.817 --> 03:22:44.986
THAT.

03:22:45.052 --> 03:22:46.320
CENTS WERE MORE COMFORTABLE WITH

03:22:46.387 --> 03:22:48.856
PEOPLE WHO LOOK LIKE US SAID AND

03:22:48.923 --> 03:22:50.591
I THINK IT POTENTIALLY

03:22:50.658 --> 03:22:52.860
PERPETUATED THAT SENSE OF GOOD

03:22:52.927 --> 03:22:54.595
OLD BOYS CLUB WHAT WHERE DOES

03:22:54.662 --> 03:22:57.698
THAT STAND HOW DOES THAT.

03:22:57.765 --> 03:22:58.699
A FACT THEN AGAIN WERE WEIGHING

03:22:58.766 --> 03:23:00.167
INTO SOMETHING THAT IS A AN

03:23:00.234 --> 03:23:01.969
EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE TO DO IS TO

03:23:02.036 --> 03:23:03.704
PICK JUDGES THAN AND WAYS THAT

03:23:03.771 --> 03:23:04.171
THAT.

03:23:04.238 --> 03:23:06.440
THE GOVERNOR WANTS TO BUT

03:23:06.507 --> 03:23:08.009
TRANSPARENCY.

03:23:08.075 --> 03:23:10.111
CONFIDENCE IN HOW THOSE

03:23:10.177 --> 03:23:12.346
DECISIONS ARE BEING MADE.

03:23:12.413 --> 03:23:14.215

I KNOW SOMETHING LIKE THAT --

03:23:32.733 --> 03:23:35.202

LEGAL AID ORGANIZATIONS DESPITE --

03:29:44.905 --> 03:29:46.640
OUR LOW PAY WE ACTUALLY DID A

MUCH BETTER JOB AT RECRUITING

03:29:48.342 --> 03:29:49.543

AS PRIVATE FIRMS -- MORE ASIAN

03:30:00.254 --> 03:30:02.156
AMERICAN ATTORNEYS AND NEARLY

03:30:02.222 --> 03:30:02.723
TWICE THE NUMBER OF AFRICAN

03:30:02.790 --> 03:30:04.358
AMERICAN ATTORNEYS.

03:30:04.425 --> 03:30:04.959
ARE DOING SOMETHING RIGHT IN

03:30:05.025 --> 03:30:06.226
RECRUITMENT OF OUR ISSUE OF

03:30:06.293 --> 03:30:07.428
COURSE IS RETENTION BECAUSE WE

03:30:07.494 --> 03:30:09.096
CANNOT COMPETE WITH THE PUBLIC

03:30:09.163 --> 03:30:12.099
SECTOR SALARIES -- WHAT WE WHAT

03:30:12.166 --> 03:30:13.534
WE DO IS WE RELY REALLY ON A

03:30:13.600 --> 03:30:14.902
DIVERSE PIPELINE OF NEW

03:30:14.969 --> 03:30:15.936
ATTORNEYS IN ORDER TO REPLACE

03:30:16.003 --> 03:30:17.471
THE FOLKS WERE LEAVING TO GO

03:30:17.538 --> 03:30:18.739
INTO GOVERNMENT WORK?

03:30:18.806 --> 03:30:19.740
OF THE STATE BAR DID OF A

03:30:19.807 --> 03:30:21.108
PREVIOUS SURVEY THAT SHOW THAT

03:30:21.175 --> 03:30:22.576
ACTUALLY A LARGE NUMBER OF CIVIL

03:30:22.643 --> 03:30:23.444
LEGAL AID ATTORNEYS WHEN THEY

03:30:23.510 --> 03:30:24.578
LEAVE LEGALLY THEY DON'T GO IN

03:30:24.645 --> 03:30:25.913
THE PRIVATE SECTOR THEY GO INTO

03:30:25.980 --> 03:30:27.214
GOVERNMENT WORK.

03:30:27.281 --> 03:30:28.615
SO WHAT WE DO IS WE TRAIN WE

03:30:28.682 --> 03:30:33.587
SUPPORT AND WE MENTOR BEFORE

03:30:33.654 --> 03:30:35.522
THEY MOVE ON AND THE HIGH COULD

03:30:35.589 --> 03:30:36.123
SCORE HAS A DISPROPORTIONATE

03:30:36.190 --> 03:30:36.724
EFFECT ON CIVIL LEGAL AID NON

03:30:36.790 --> 03:30:37.224

03:30:37.291 --> 03:30:37.825
BECAUSE AS A DISPROPORTIONATE

03:30:37.891 --> 03:30:39.860
EFFECT ON ATTORNEYSOF COLOUR --

03:30:39.927 --> 03:30:40.894

DIVERSE -- ATTORNEYS WITH THAT

03:30:43.764 --> 03:30:44.999
MEANS IS THAT OUR PIPELINE IS

03:30:45.065 --> 03:30:46.600
HURT AND ULTIMATELY HURTS THE

03:30:46.667 --> 03:30:48.068

ON I THINK IT'S SO IMPORTANT I

03:38:56.456 --> 03:38:57.891
APPLIED THAT.

03:38:57.958 --> 03:38:58.992
YOU'RE HAVING THESE DISCUSSIONS

03:38:59.059 --> 03:39:01.528
BY ONE ENCOURAGE YOU TO BE BULL.

AT PIPELINE INITIATIVE.

03:39:05.165 --> 03:39:06.666
THERE WERE TWO PROGRAMS THAT HAD

03:39:06.733 --> 03:39:08.702
ENORMOUS AFFECT MY ABILITY TO GO

03:39:08.768 --> 03:39:09.703
TO LAW SCHOOL.

03:39:09.769 --> 03:39:11.037
BOTH OF THEM HAPPENED WHEN I WAS

03:39:11.104 --> 03:39:12.138
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

03:39:12.205 --> 03:39:14.274
THE FIRST WAS PARTICIPATION IN

03:39:14.341 --> 03:39:15.775

COUNTIES I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU

WITH THEM OR HOW YOU CAN PARTNER

03:39:24.551 --> 03:39:25.919
WITH OTHER INITIATIVES.

03:39:25.986 --> 03:39:27.487
I SAY THAT THAT HAD THE BIGGEST

03:39:27.554 --> 03:39:29.623
IMPACT BECAUSE NOT ONLY DID A

03:39:29.689 --> 03:39:31.458

03:39:31.525 --> 03:39:33.126
AS A LAWYER MY PATH TO LAW

03:39:33.193 --> 03:39:33.793
SCHOOL.

03:39:33.860 --> 03:39:35.428
THEY GOT ME TO A PATH OF COLLEGE

03:39:35.495 --> 03:39:37.030
READINESS THAT I WOULD NOT HAVE

03:39:37.097 --> 03:39:38.832
HAD IN MY HIGH SCHOOL THEY DID

03:39:38.899 --> 03:39:39.766
NOT HAVE.

03:39:39.833 --> 03:39:41.535
ACADEMIC PROGRAMMING THAT WAS

03:39:41.601 --> 03:39:46.973
COMPETITIVE WITH OTHER

03:39:47.040 --> 03:39:48.975
CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOLS.

03:39:49.042 --> 03:39:50.277
THE SECOND WAS IS THE FIRST TIME

03:39:50.343 --> 03:39:50.744

GO TO UCLA TO SEE THEMSELVES IN

03:39:56.917 --> 03:39:58.318
PRE Là PROGRAMMING IT WAS THE

FIRST TIME I HAD EVER MET A

03:40:00.487 --> 03:40:01.421
LAWYER.

03:40:01.488 --> 03:40:03.023
THERE I LOOK BACK AT MY

03:40:03.089 --> 03:40:05.525
EXPERIENCES AND I TELL PEOPLE

03:40:05.592 --> 03:40:06.693
THAT I HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF

03:40:06.760 --> 03:40:07.994
PURPOSE.

03:40:08.061 --> 03:40:12.065
IN LAW SCHOOL I WAS ABLE TO HELP --

03:40:12.132 --> 03:40:14.367
COCHAIR A CASE WHERE WE WERE

03:40:14.434 --> 03:40:16.603
SUCCESSFUL IN GETTING OUR CLIENT

03:40:16.670 --> 03:40:17.871
ASYLUM.

03:40:17.938 --> 03:40:19.506
I SERVED WOMEN AND CHILDREN IN

AND CONTINUE TO SERVE.

03:40:27.213 --> 03:40:29.282
I STOOD UP IN LAW SCHOOL IN OVER

03:40:29.349 --> 03:40:32.385
TWENTY STATE CASES.

03:40:32.452 --> 03:40:34.287
I'M READY TO BE A LITIGATOR.

03:40:34.354 --> 03:40:35.622
I FIND OUT FRIDAY FIVE PASSED

03:40:35.689 --> 03:40:37.023
FOR THE FINGERS CROSSED.

03:40:37.090 --> 03:40:38.858
BUT BUT I WANTED TO HAVE MY

03:40:38.925 --> 03:40:40.360
VOICE HEARD BECAUSE I I WANT TO

03:40:40.427 --> 03:40:42.062
IMPLORE YOU WHEN I WAS IN HIGH

03:40:42.128 --> 03:40:44.297
SCHOOL AND WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE

03:40:44.364 --> 03:40:45.231
AND WHEN I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO

03:40:45.298 --> 03:40:45.765
HAVE.

03:40:45.832 --> 03:40:47.767
MENTORS EXTEND A HAND TO

03:40:47.834 --> 03:40:49.703
PROGRAMS TELL ME YOU CAN GO TO

03:40:49.769 --> 03:40:51.538
LAW SCHOOL EVEN WHEN I COULDN'T

03:40:51.605 --> 03:40:53.273
SEE COLLEGE ON THE HORIZON.

03:40:53.340 --> 03:40:54.808
THAT MADE A DIFFERENCE.

03:40:54.874 --> 03:40:56.142
IT'S EASY TO GLANCE OVER THE K.

03:40:56.209 --> 03:40:57.711
THROUGH TWELVE PIPELINE

03:40:57.777 --> 03:40:59.279
PROGRAMMING AND SAY.

03:40:59.346 --> 03:41:01.715
HOW MUCH DIFFERENCE CAN REALLY

03:41:01.781 --> 03:41:03.516
BE MADE I'M TELLING YOU?

03:41:03.583 --> 03:41:04.250
AS A STAND FOR LAW GRADUATE.

03:41:04.317 --> 03:41:06.119
I CREDIT THOSE PROGRAMS FOR

03:41:06.186 --> 03:41:08.488
PUTTING ME ON THE SPOT.

03:41:08.555 --> 03:41:09.756
THE OTHER ISSUE I WANTED TO

03:41:09.823 --> 03:41:11.124
BRING TO YOUR ATTENTION IS

03:41:11.191 --> 03:41:13.259
EMPOWERING OTHERS WHO HAVE THE

03:41:13.326 --> 03:41:15.161
PRIVILEGE OF PURPOSE LIKE ME. TO

03:41:15.228 --> 03:41:16.997
ACTUALLY SIR.

03:41:17.063 --> 03:41:18.665
I KNOW THAT.

03:41:18.732 --> 03:41:19.899
IT'S DIFFICULT TO BALANCE

03:41:19.966 --> 03:41:21.167
DIFFERENT THINGS TO PROTECT

03:41:21.234 --> 03:41:24.104
CONSUMERS -- WITH WHEN IT COMES

03:41:24.170 --> 03:41:26.339
TO THE BAR EXAM SCORING.

03:41:26.406 --> 03:41:26.873
BUT WHEN I THINK ABOUT MY

03:41:26.940 --> 03:41:28.241
COMMUNITY.

03:41:28.308 --> 03:41:30.510
I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT PASSIONATE

03:41:30.577 --> 03:41:32.278
LAWYERS WHO WANT TO HELP THEM.

03:41:32.345 --> 03:41:33.346
I'M WORRIED THAT THERE'S NOT

03:41:33.413 --> 03:41:35.015
ENOUGH PEOPLE WERE READY TO GO

03:41:35.081 --> 03:41:36.383
DOWN AND SERVE THOSE RURAL

03:41:36.449 --> 03:41:38.485
COMMUNITIES SO BE BOLTS.

03:41:38.551 --> 03:41:40.286
THERE ARE OTHER WAYS BESIDES THE

03:41:40.353 --> 03:41:41.187
CUT SCORE.

03:41:41.254 --> 03:41:42.856
WHICH I'M NOT SAYING IT'S A GOOD

03:41:42.922 --> 03:41:43.957
OR BAD IDEA.

03:41:44.024 --> 03:41:46.593
THAT CAN BE EMPLOYED FOR EXAMPLE

03:41:46.660 --> 03:41:47.894
IF YOU'VE TAKEN THE CALIFORNIA

03:41:47.961 --> 03:41:49.496
BAR YOU KNOW THAT THERE ARE

03:41:49.562 --> 03:41:50.930
EIGHTEEN DIFFERENT SUBJECTS AS

03:41:50.997 --> 03:41:53.833
WELL AS THE ANTI THAT YOU NEED

03:41:53.900 --> 03:41:54.901
TO BE PREPARED.

03:41:54.968 --> 03:41:57.070
FOR WHY NOT GIVE US SIX ESSAYS

03:41:57.137 --> 03:41:58.304
ONLY FIVE OR SCORED.

03:41:58.371 --> 03:42:00.407
AND GIVE THE CHOICE OF WHICH

03:42:00.473 --> 03:42:01.675
FIVE TO TAKE.

03:42:01.741 --> 03:42:04.177
WHY NOT EXCEPT IN THESE SCORES

03:42:04.244 --> 03:42:05.912
THAT ARE PASSING FROM OTHER

03:42:05.979 --> 03:42:07.247
JURISDICTIONS?

03:42:07.313 --> 03:42:09.182
AND FOR FOLKS WHO CANNOT AFFORD

03:42:09.249 --> 03:42:10.884
TO PAY OVER THREE THOUSAND

03:42:10.950 --> 03:42:12.252
DOLLARS FOR EVERY TIME YOU TAKE

03:42:12.318 --> 03:42:13.319
A TEST.

03:42:13.386 --> 03:42:15.055
THAT'S THREE MONTHS.

03:42:15.121 --> 03:42:16.790
NOT WORKING PLUS THE BAR EXAM

03:42:16.856 --> 03:42:18.358
FEES.

03:42:18.425 --> 03:42:20.727
WHY DON'T YOU HONOR IF THEY HAD

03:42:20.794 --> 03:42:22.696
A PASSING IN THE SCORE FROM A

03:42:22.762 --> 03:42:23.830
PREVIOUS TEST?

03:42:23.897 --> 03:42:25.065
AND HAVE THEM SIT.

03:42:25.131 --> 03:42:26.399
ESSENTIALLY FOR THE ATTORNEYS

03:42:26.466 --> 03:42:28.635
EXAM THAT WOULD TEST THE

03:42:28.702 --> 03:42:29.736
EIGHTEEN SUBJECTS.

03:42:29.803 --> 03:42:31.304

LOOK AT WAYS. TO EMPOWER THOSE

03:42:37.644 --> 03:42:38.978
WHO HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF

03:42:39.045 --> 03:42:41.114
PURPOSE TO ACTUALLY GO INTO OUR

STEVE HI AL AB SUPPORTS THE

03:42:58.131 --> 03:42:59.766

THE BAR EXAM REFORM AND THE

03:43:01.334 --> 03:43:02.869
TRANSPARENCY RECOMMENDATIONS

03:43:02.936 --> 03:43:04.070
REGARDING THE APPOINTMENTS TO

03:43:04.137 --> 03:43:05.772
THE JUDICIARY WE BELIEVE THAT

03:43:05.839 --> 03:43:07.474
POLICYMAKERS ARE IN PARTICULAR --

03:43:07.540 --> 03:43:09.242
NEED OF DATA GATHERING SO THAT

03:43:09.309 --> 03:43:10.877
WE CAN FURTHER UNDERSTAND THE

03:43:10.944 --> 03:43:12.545
IMPACT OF CALIFORNIA'S EXTREMELY

03:43:12.612 --> 03:43:14.614
HIGH CUT SCORE ON NOT ONLY THE

03:43:14.681 --> 03:43:15.381
DIVERSITY OF THE LEGAL

03:43:15.448 --> 03:43:17.250
PROFESSION BUT ALSO THE JUSTICE

03:43:17.317 --> 03:43:19.018
GAP IN GENERAL WE ENCOURAGE

03:43:19.085 --> 03:43:20.487
ALLEGE THE LEGISLATURE TO

03:43:20.553 --> 03:43:21.821
SUPPORT SUCH A STUDY.

03:43:21.888 --> 03:43:23.156
AND DATA GATHERING THAT WOULD

03:43:23.223 --> 03:43:25.158
BOLSTER THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT

03:43:25.225 --> 03:43:26.960
YOU ARE CONSIDERING TODAY THANK

03:43:27.026 --> 03:43:27.127
YOU.

03:43:27.193 --> 03:43:28.828
THANK YOU.

03:43:28.895 --> 03:43:29.662
RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR

03:43:29.729 --> 03:43:31.965
PARTICIPATING.

03:43:32.031 --> 03:43:33.633
AND THIS IS.

03:43:33.700 --> 03:43:35.602
CLEARLY SOMETHING WE'RE GONNA BE

03:43:35.668 --> 03:43:37.403
CONTINUING TO WORK ON THERE'S A

03:43:37.470 --> 03:43:39.239
ROLE FOR THE LEGISLATURE THERE'S

03:43:39.305 --> 03:43:40.874
A ROLE FOR THE SUPREME COURT.

03:43:40.940 --> 03:43:42.242
ROLE FOR THE ADMINISTRATION HERE

03:43:42.308 --> 03:43:44.944
AND I THINK THAT WE NEED TO DO A

03:43:45.011 --> 03:43:46.446
BETTER JOB OF WORKING TOGETHER

03:43:46.513 --> 03:43:47.313
AND MAKING SURE WE'RE

03:43:47.380 --> 03:43:48.348
ESTABLISHING APPROPRIATE

03:43:48.414 --> 03:43:50.817
STANDARDS.

03:43:50.884 --> 03:43:52.185
THE BAR EXAM DOES NOT ASSURE

03:43:52.252 --> 03:43:53.586
COMPETENT ATTORNEYS AND THE

03:43:53.653 --> 03:43:55.555
THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS

03:43:55.622 --> 03:43:56.422
VERY CLEAR.

03:43:56.489 --> 03:43:58.258
BUT THAT'S THE ROLE OF THE STATE

03:43:58.324 --> 03:43:59.926
BAR TO ASSURE COP INTERNEES THE

03:43:59.993 --> 03:44:01.528
ROLE THE STATE BAR'S PUBLIC

03:44:01.594 --> 03:44:01.995
PROTECTION [inaudible]

03:44:02.061 --> 03:44:06.866
AND THE BAR EXAM IS MERELY AN

03:44:06.933 --> 03:44:09.736
INDICATION OF MINIMUM STANDARDS

03:44:09.803 --> 03:44:13.106
FOR BEING ABLE TO PRACTICE LAW.

03:44:13.173 --> 03:44:14.407
BUT ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS

03:44:14.474 --> 03:44:16.976
COMPENSATE CONSIDERATIONS THOSE

03:44:17.043 --> 03:44:18.344
CERTAINLY DEVELOP OVER TIME I

03:44:18.411 --> 03:44:19.746
THINK THE HISTORY OF THE

03:44:19.813 --> 03:44:20.580
PRACTICE.

03:44:20.647 --> 03:44:23.416
SHOWS AND THOSE ARE VERY

03:44:23.483 --> 03:44:25.318
CRITICAL COMPONENTS THAT WE NEED

03:44:25.385 --> 03:44:26.920
TO TAKE SERIOUSLY WITH RESPECT

03:44:26.986 --> 03:44:27.987
OF PROTECTING THE PUBLIC

03:44:28.054 --> 03:44:28.254
ENSURING.

03:44:28.321 --> 03:44:29.956
THAT.

03:44:30.023 --> 03:44:31.958
CONSUMERS HAVE ACCESS TO

03:44:32.025 --> 03:44:32.892
COMPETENCY INNARDS.

03:44:32.959 --> 03:44:34.394
BUT WE ALSO NEED TO LOOK BACK

03:44:34.460 --> 03:44:35.929
INTO THE EDUCATION SYSTEM AND

03:44:35.995 --> 03:44:37.363
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THE

03:44:37.430 --> 03:44:38.865
LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN TAKING.

03:44:38.932 --> 03:44:41.134
