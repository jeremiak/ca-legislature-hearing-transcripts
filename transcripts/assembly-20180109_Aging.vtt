STAFF TURNOVER IS VERY LOW AND

00:25:04.336 --> 00:25:08.507 region:rollup2
THAT MEANS PROGRAMS CAN FOCUS ON

00:25:06.305 --> 00:25:10.542 region:rollup2
PASSIONATE LEADERSHIP. QUALITY

00:25:08.507 --> 00:25:12.144 region:rollup2

FINDING CENTERS ARE OPERATING AT

FULL CAPACITY OR THERE ARE NONE

00:25:29.294 --> 00:25:32.664 region:rollup2
IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AT ALL AND

00:25:31.263 --> 00:25:33.699 region:rollup2
FOR THIS REASON CENTERS LIKE

00:25:32.664 --> 00:25:34.400 region:rollup2
MINE.

00:25:33.699 --> 00:25:35.934 region:rollup2
I HAVE HAD TO START WAITING

00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:37.503 region:rollup2
LISTS WHICH WE STARTED FOUR

00:25:35.934 --> 00:25:38.604 region:rollup2
YEARS AGO.

00:25:37.503 --> 00:25:39.638 region:rollup2
TODAY WE HAVE FIFTY THREE ON

00:25:38.604 --> 00:25:41.540 region:rollup2
THAT LIST IN THE AVERAGE WAIT IS

00:25:39.638 --> 00:25:43.175 region:rollup2
ELEVEN MONTHS.

00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:44.143 region:rollup2
QUITE OFTEN BY THE TIME WE CALL

00:25:43.175 --> 00:25:45.744 region:rollup2
THE FAMILY THEIR LOVED ONE HAS

00:25:44.143 --> 00:25:47.079 region:rollup2
BEEN PLACED IN A NURSING HOME OR

00:25:45.744 --> 00:25:48.847 region:rollup2
IS PASSED AWAY.

00:25:47.079 --> 00:25:50.215 region:rollup2
IN THE LAST TWO YEARS THAT THE

00:25:48.847 --> 00:25:50.816 region:rollup2
CASE FOR THIRTY THREE PEOPLE

00:25:50.215 --> 00:25:52.718 region:rollup2
THAT RISE TO THE TOP OF THE

00:25:50.816 --> 00:25:53.986 region:rollup2
WAITING LIST. I'M VERY PROUD OF

00:25:52.718 --> 00:25:55.854 region:rollup2
THE FACT THAT ARE CENTER

00:25:53.986 --> 00:25:57.523 region:rollup2
BUILDING NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR.

00:25:55.854 --> 00:25:58.524 region:rollup2
WAS BUILT WITH STATE FUNDS OVER

00:25:57.523 --> 00:26:00.526 region:rollup2
THIS DEPARTMENT AGING.

00:25:58.524 --> 00:26:02.394 region:rollup2
OF PROVIDED THOSE FUNDS AND WE

00:26:00.526 --> 00:26:03.362 region:rollup2
WERE THE FIRST BILL TO PURPOSE

00:26:02.394 --> 00:26:05.063 region:rollup2
ADULT DAY HEALTH CENTER IN THE

00:26:03.362 --> 00:26:06.632 region:rollup2
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND IT WAS

00:26:05.063 --> 00:26:07.733 region:rollup2
BUILT BY A STRONG GROUP OF

00:26:06.632 --> 00:26:09.568 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY ADVOCATES

00:26:07.733 --> 00:26:11.270 region:rollup2
SOME OF WHO HAVE AGED AND

00:26:09.568 --> 00:26:13.038 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY USE OUR PROGRAM.

00:26:11.270 --> 00:26:14.072 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY THIRTY FOUR YEARS

00:26:13.038 --> 00:26:16.308 region:rollup2
AGO WE HAD A BIT WE HAVE A

00:26:14.072 --> 00:26:18.110 region:rollup2
BUILDING THAT IS GROSSLY NINE

00:26:16.308 --> 00:26:19.445 region:rollup2
EIGHTY A COMPACT COMPLIANCE.

00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:21.847 region:rollup2
WHETHER ITS ARE DOORWAYS R.

00:26:19.445 --> 00:26:23.382 region:rollup2
SPRINKLERS R. BATHROOM STALLS

00:26:21.847 --> 00:26:26.151 region:rollup2
WERE GRANDFATHERED IN BUT NONE

00:26:23.382 --> 00:26:27.686 region:rollup2
THE LESS WERE NOT A SAFE CENTER.

00:26:26.151 --> 00:26:29.721 region:rollup2
IN COMPARISON TODAY'S.

00:26:27.686 --> 00:26:31.523 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION WERE OPERATING AT

00:26:29.721 --> 00:26:33.091 region:rollup2
MAX CAPACITY WE DON'T HAVE

00:26:31.523 --> 00:26:34.092 region:rollup2
ENOUGH TOILETS OFFICE SPACE AND

00:26:33.091 --> 00:26:36.361 region:rollup2
WITH ALL THE WHEELCHAIRS AND

00:26:34.092 --> 00:26:37.696 region:rollup2
WALKERS IT'S TIGHT TIGHT TIGHT.

00:26:36.361 --> 00:26:39.031 region:rollup2
AND YET WE OPERATE ADULT DAY

00:26:37.696 --> 00:26:41.366 region:rollup2
HEALTH CARE CENTER AND ADULT

00:26:39.031 --> 00:26:42.234 region:rollup2
DAYCARE CENTER WHERE EIGHTY CRC

00:26:41.366 --> 00:26:44.136 region:rollup2
WERE PART OF A COMMUNITY BASED

00:26:42.234 --> 00:26:46.004 region:rollup2
HEALTH HOME PILOT WE DO SUPPORT

00:26:44.136 --> 00:26:47.573 region:rollup2
GROUPS AND CAREGIVER WORKSHOPS.

00:26:46.004 --> 00:26:49.141 region:rollup2
WOOD SO WE NEED TO EXPAND OUR

00:26:47.573 --> 00:26:50.809 region:rollup2
SPACE BECAUSE OF DEMAND BUT WE

00:26:49.141 --> 00:26:51.977 region:rollup2
CAN'T RENOVATE OUR CURRENT SITE

00:26:50.809 --> 00:26:52.978 region:rollup2
WITHOUT HAVING TO INVEST SIX

00:26:51.977 --> 00:26:54.546 region:rollup2
HUNDRED THOUSAND JUST FOR

00:26:52.978 --> 00:26:56.115 region:rollup2
RETROFITTING.

00:26:54.546 --> 00:26:57.683 region:rollup2
THEN WE NEED ADDITIONAL FUNDS

00:26:56.115 --> 00:26:59.785 region:rollup2
FOR ACTUAL EXPANSION. AN

00:26:57.683 --> 00:27:01.653 region:rollup2
ENGINEERING FIRM WE HIRED IN TWO

00:26:59.785 --> 00:27:03.388 region:rollup2
THOUSAND FIFTEEN DETERMINED THAT

00:27:01.653 --> 00:27:05.123 region:rollup2
FINDING A NEW CENTER LOCATION

00:27:03.388 --> 00:27:08.127 region:rollup2
THEN TEARING DOWN THE CURRENT

00:27:05.123 --> 00:27:09.595 region:rollup2
WAS THE BEST. WAY TO GO WELL WE

00:27:08.127 --> 00:27:11.730 region:rollup2
CAN'T EXACTLY DO THAT.

00:27:09.595 --> 00:27:12.865 region:rollup2
YET FOR TWO YEARS NOW OUR LOCAL

00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:14.166 region:rollup2
LEADERS HAVE BEEN TRYING TO

00:27:12.865 --> 00:27:16.135 region:rollup2
SOLVE THIS PROBLEM WITH LITTLE

00:27:14.166 --> 00:27:17.236 region:rollup2
PROGRESS DUE TO LACK OF FUNDS.

00:27:16.135 --> 00:27:18.303 region:rollup2
THE LOSS OF REDEVELOPMENT

00:27:17.236 --> 00:27:19.905 region:rollup2
DOLLARS WAS A BIG HIT WERE

00:27:18.303 --> 00:27:21.840 region:rollup2
PLANNING.

00:27:19.905 --> 00:27:23.442 region:rollup2
FOUNDATIONS DON'T GENERALLY WANT

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:25.010 region:rollup2
TO FUND BRICK AND MORTAR.

00:27:23.442 --> 00:27:27.212 region:rollup2
ENTITIES INVOLVED ARE FEARFUL OF

00:27:25.010 --> 00:27:28.147 region:rollup2
FINANCING CAPITAL DUE TO

00:27:27.212 --> 00:27:29.114 region:rollup2
PRECARIOUS FEDERAL HEALTH

00:27:28.147 --> 00:27:30.449 region:rollup2

00:27:29.114 --> 00:27:31.783 region:rollup2
REFORMS.

00:27:30.449 --> 00:27:33.352 region:rollup2
AND WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO

00:27:31.783 --> 00:27:34.820 region:rollup2
SOLVE THIS PROBLEM DESPITE ALL

00:27:33.352 --> 00:27:36.688 region:rollup2
THE GAINS FOR THE PEOPLE OF OUR

00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:38.157 region:rollup2
COUNTY IN THE PAIRS INVOLVED.

00:27:36.688 --> 00:27:39.458 region:rollup2
IN THIS STATE EXPANSION IS

00:27:38.157 --> 00:27:40.893 region:rollup2
NEEDED TO MEET THE DEMAND BUT

00:27:39.458 --> 00:27:42.561 region:rollup2
ALSO TO PROTECT THE CURRENT

00:27:40.893 --> 00:27:44.129 region:rollup2
CENTERS FROM CLOSING WHEN WE

00:27:42.561 --> 00:27:45.397 region:rollup2

00:27:44.129 --> 00:27:47.366 region:rollup2
NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR FOR FIFTY

00:27:45.397 --> 00:27:48.901 region:rollup2
NINE PEOPLE A DAY. YOU COULD

00:27:47.366 --> 00:27:49.468 region:rollup2
FINANCIALLY BREAK EVEN BY

00:27:48.901 --> 00:27:51.637 region:rollup2
SERVING ISSUES TWENTY FIVE A

DAY.

00:27:51.637 --> 00:27:55.107 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT THE CASE ANYMORE WITH

00:27:53.372 --> 00:27:55.641 region:rollup2
CURRENT MEDI CAL RATES SO TO BE

00:27:55.107 --> 00:27:57.876 region:rollup2
FINANCIALLY VIABLE IN OUR

00:27:55.641 --> 00:27:59.545 region:rollup2
COUNTY.

ONE HUNDRED PER DAY.

00:28:01.313 --> 00:28:04.683 region:rollup2
IT SOUNDS LIKE A LOT BUT IT'S

00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:07.953 region:rollup2
THERE SO WE NEED MORE SPACE TO

00:28:06.585 --> 00:28:09.855 region:rollup2
MEET THE DEMAND AND ALSO TO

00:28:07.953 --> 00:28:11.256 region:rollup2
AVOID CLOSURES DUE TO.

00:28:09.855 --> 00:28:12.524 region:rollup2
ONGOING AND NEGATIVE REVENUE

00:28:11.256 --> 00:28:14.293 region:rollup2

00:28:16.628 --> 00:28:18.463 region:rollup2
AND WE NEED TO BUILD

00:28:17.663 --> 00:28:19.998 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE PEOPLE OF

FOR ADVOCATING I'M.

00:35:43.174 --> 00:35:45.010 region:rollup2
IT YOU COULD BE ANYWHERE ELSE WE

00:35:44.042 --> 00:35:46.644 region:rollup2
PART WOULD EXPECTED TO BE

00:35:45.010 --> 00:35:48.046 region:rollup2
SOMEWHERE ELSE.

00:35:46.644 --> 00:35:49.648 region:rollup2
BUT BEING HERE MEANS A LOT NINE

00:35:48.046 --> 00:35:52.450 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT YOUR MOTHER

00:35:49.648 --> 00:35:54.252 region:rollup2

00:36:01.226 --> 00:36:04.996 region:rollup2
IT WOULD LIKELY BE TWENTY TWENTY

00:36:03.662 --> 00:36:06.831 region:rollup2
IS THAT WHAT THEY'RE ACT. OKAY.

00:36:04.996 --> 00:36:08.600 region:rollup2
THE OTHER THING IS THAT I I

00:36:06.831 --> 00:36:10.835 region:rollup2

AGENCY THAT WILL DO THAT OKAY.

00:36:25.650 --> 00:36:29.788 region:rollup2
I'M OF ONE OF THE THINGS THAT OF

00:36:28.086 --> 00:36:30.889 region:rollup2

THE SAME. IT IT REALLY IS A

00:38:30.208 --> 00:38:33.178 region:rollup2
TSUNAMI ON THIS DISEASE IS A

00:38:32.177 --> 00:38:34.245 region:rollup2
HORRIBLE DISEASE ON AND THE MORE

00:38:33.178 --> 00:38:35.880 region:rollup2
THAT WE CAN CREATE OPPORTUNITIES

00:38:34.245 --> 00:38:36.614 region:rollup2

THAT ARE ARE GOING THROUGH THE

00:38:36.614 --> 00:38:39.884 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE TO ACTUALLY HAVE SOME

00:38:38.082 --> 00:38:41.052 region:rollup2
CARE. THAT. NO UNDERSTANDS THE

00:38:39.884 --> 00:38:42.287 region:rollup2
DISEASE AND CAN HELP THEM.

00:38:41.052 --> 00:38:43.922 region:rollup2
IS IS REALLY IMPORTANT SO I I

00:38:42.287 --> 00:38:45.023 region:rollup2
HAVE A COUPLE OF SUGGESTIONS AND

00:38:43.922 --> 00:38:45.957 region:rollup2
THERE ARE A MENACE SUPPORT THE

00:38:45.023 --> 00:38:47.158 region:rollup2
BILL I I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

00:38:45.957 --> 00:38:48.393 region:rollup2
I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT. THE CHAIR

00:38:47.158 --> 00:38:49.594 region:rollup2
TALK ABOUT MAYBE I AM INCLUDING

00:38:48.393 --> 00:38:50.495 region:rollup2
SOME OTHER SERVICES AND MAY BE

00:38:49.594 --> 00:38:53.164 region:rollup2
MAKING IT A LITTLE BIT BIGGER.

00:38:50.495 --> 00:38:54.065 region:rollup2
I'M A COUPLE OF THINGS ONE IS.

00:38:53.164 --> 00:38:55.133 region:rollup2
.

00:38:54.065 --> 00:38:56.801 region:rollup2
IS RIGHT NOW THE WAY IT'S

00:38:55.133 --> 00:38:57.302 region:rollup2
WRITTEN THE MONEY WOULD GO TO

00:38:56.801 --> 00:38:58.937 region:rollup2
THE STATE DEPARTMENT TO

00:38:57.302 --> 00:38:59.504 region:rollup2
ADMINISTER.

00:38:58.937 --> 00:39:02.006 region:rollup2
AND IT WOULD IT WOULD BE. IT

00:38:59.504 --> 00:39:04.108 region:rollup2
IPS.

00:39:02.006 --> 00:39:05.577 region:rollup2
GENERALLY BASED ON THE NEED IN

00:39:04.108 --> 00:39:07.045 region:rollup2
THE COMMUNITY AND THE FACT THAT

00:39:05.577 --> 00:39:08.146 region:rollup2
THERE ARE SOME COMMUNITIES THAT

00:39:07.045 --> 00:39:09.547 region:rollup2
HAVE VERY LITTLE SERVICES RIGHT

00:39:08.146 --> 00:39:09.881 region:rollup2
QUITE FRANKLY THOSE ARE RURAL

00:39:09.547 --> 00:39:12.083 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES.

00:39:09.881 --> 00:39:13.852 region:rollup2
IN RURAL COMMUNITIES THERE ARE

00:39:12.083 --> 00:39:15.887 region:rollup2
NO SERVICES IN AND MANY.

00:39:13.852 --> 00:39:17.989 region:rollup2
BUT BUT THE CHALLENGE WITH

00:39:15.887 --> 00:39:19.924 region:rollup2
DOING A GRANT PROPOSAL WHERE

00:39:17.989 --> 00:39:22.794 region:rollup2
IT'S A COMP COMPETITIVE GRANT.

00:39:19.924 --> 00:39:24.596 region:rollup2
IS THAT THAT JURISDICTION HAS TO

00:39:22.794 --> 00:39:26.097 region:rollup2
HIRE A GRANT WRITER. THE STATE

00:39:24.596 --> 00:39:27.498 region:rollup2
HAS TO HIRE A GRANT RIVER

00:39:26.097 --> 00:39:29.934 region:rollup2
REVIEWER AND IT'S USUALLY STAFF

00:39:27.498 --> 00:39:31.870 region:rollup2
BUT IT COSTS MONEY. AND SO

00:39:29.934 --> 00:39:33.571 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION ENDS UP TAKING A

00:39:31.870 --> 00:39:35.807 region:rollup2
CHUNK.

00:39:33.571 --> 00:39:38.009 region:rollup2
AND SO IT MAY MAKE SENSE FOR

00:39:35.807 --> 00:39:39.310 region:rollup2
THIS TO BE SET UP SO THAT THE

00:39:38.009 --> 00:39:40.945 region:rollup2
MONEY GOES DIRECTLY TO THE

00:39:39.310 --> 00:39:41.579 region:rollup2
COUNTIES.

00:39:40.945 --> 00:39:43.214 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY'RE THE ONES THAT

00:39:41.579 --> 00:39:44.682 region:rollup2
ARE ACTUALLY CAN ADMINISTER THE

00:39:43.214 --> 00:39:48.419 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS. AND.

00:39:44.682 --> 00:39:49.454 region:rollup2
AND I PERSONALLY HATE THAT THAT

00:39:48.419 --> 00:39:51.222 region:rollup2
THE ALLOCATION BASED ON.

00:39:49.454 --> 00:39:51.723 region:rollup2
.

00:39:51.222 --> 00:39:53.591 region:rollup2
ON.

00:39:51.723 --> 00:39:55.326 region:rollup2
POPULATION BECAUSE IN THE RURAL

00:39:53.591 --> 00:39:56.828 region:rollup2
COUNTIES GET VERY LITTLE BUT

00:39:55.326 --> 00:39:58.429 region:rollup2
THERE MAY BE THERE THERE HAVE

00:39:56.828 --> 00:39:58.963 region:rollup2
BEEN SOME FORMULAS DEVELOPED

00:39:58.429 --> 00:40:00.632 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:39:58.963 --> 00:40:02.233 region:rollup2
THAT TAKES POPULATION INTO

00:40:00.632 --> 00:40:04.936 region:rollup2
CONSIDERATION BUT ALSO MAYBE

00:40:02.233 --> 00:40:06.204 region:rollup2
TAKE THAT FACT THAT SOME OF THE

00:40:04.936 --> 00:40:07.538 region:rollup2
RURAL COUNTIES ARM HAVE NO

00:40:06.204 --> 00:40:08.806 region:rollup2
SERVICES AND YOU MIGHT BE ABLE

00:40:07.538 --> 00:40:11.409 region:rollup2
TO BOOST IT SO WHAT I'M

00:40:08.806 --> 00:40:12.810 region:rollup2
SUGGESTING IS. IS RATHER THAN

00:40:11.409 --> 00:40:14.712 region:rollup2
SETTING IT UP AS A STATE

00:40:12.810 --> 00:40:16.214 region:rollup2
COMPETITIVE PROGRAM THAT THERE

00:40:14.712 --> 00:40:17.148 region:rollup2
BE A WAY TO GET IT STRAIGHT TO

00:40:16.214 --> 00:40:18.917 region:rollup2
THE LOCALS.

00:40:17.148 --> 00:40:21.519 region:rollup2
THE TREASURES DEPARTMENT

00:40:18.917 --> 00:40:23.721 region:rollup2
DOESN'T HAVE THAT. KNOWLEDGE OR

00:40:21.519 --> 00:40:25.156 region:rollup2
OR THAT THE BASE OF INFORMATION

00:40:23.721 --> 00:40:27.959 region:rollup2
THAT THE CARE PROVIDERS HABIT IN

00:40:25.156 --> 00:40:29.127 region:rollup2
REGARDS TO WHAT THE MARKET MOST

00:40:27.959 --> 00:40:29.928 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE SERVICES.

00:40:29.127 --> 00:40:33.231 region:rollup2
AND MOST APPROPRIATE.

00:40:29.928 --> 00:40:34.899 region:rollup2
.

00:40:33.231 --> 00:40:36.567 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT SHOULD BE IN

00:40:34.899 --> 00:40:39.404 region:rollup2
PLACE WHEN YOU'RE HERE DEALING

00:40:36.567 --> 00:40:41.272 region:rollup2
WITH SENIORS WITH MEMORY ISSUES

00:40:39.404 --> 00:40:42.440 region:rollup2
AND HEALTH CARE ISSUES SO I'M

00:40:41.272 --> 00:40:43.574 region:rollup2
I'M JUST SUGGESTING THAT THERE

00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:46.110 region:rollup2
MAY BE IT A DIFFERENT WAY TO DO

00:40:43.574 --> 00:40:47.578 region:rollup2
IT. THAT'LL MAKE IT GET TO THE

00:40:46.110 --> 00:40:49.948 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO REALLY ARE GOING TO

00:40:47.578 --> 00:40:51.482 region:rollup2
BE ABLE TO START. BUILDING AND

00:40:49.948 --> 00:40:53.117 region:rollup2
OFFERING THE SERVICES AS QUICKLY

00:40:51.482 --> 00:40:54.619 region:rollup2
AS POSSIBLE. DOT THAT WAS MY.

00:40:53.117 --> 00:40:56.187 region:rollup2
.

00:40:54.619 --> 00:40:58.523 region:rollup2
MIGHT. YOU KNOW AS I LOOKED AT

00:40:56.187 --> 00:40:59.891 region:rollup2
HOW OPERATIONALLY YOU YOU HAD IT

00:40:58.523 --> 00:41:01.092 region:rollup2
SET UP THE TREASURE IS GOING TO

00:40:59.891 --> 00:41:02.961 region:rollup2
BE CONVENING AND DOING THINGS

00:41:01.092 --> 00:41:04.395 region:rollup2
WHICH MEANS IT'LL BE A GOOD.

00:41:02.961 --> 00:41:06.531 region:rollup2
FIVE YEARS BEFORE ANY MONEY
