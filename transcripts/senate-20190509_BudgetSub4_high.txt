SIXTY SEVEN THE CORRECTIVE CRUEL FLAW IN THE JUDICIAL RETIREMENT SYSTEM TO GET AFFECTS ALL JUDGES IN CALIFORNIA. APPOINTED OR ELECTED SINCE NOVEMBER OF NINETEEN NINETY FOUR I PROMISE TO BE BRIEF I KNOW YOU HAVE A LOT OF ISSUES AND IT'S DANGEROUS WHEN A JUDGE -- LOWER PROMISES TO BE BRIEF BUT I WILL DO MY BEST I AM A JUDGE FROM THIS PER QUARTER FRESNO COUNTY I HAVE BEEN FOR TWENTY YEARS AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE ALLIANCE OF CALIFORNIA JUDGES. A SPONSOR OF SENATE BILL. ONE EIGHTY FOUR I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE URGENCY AND THE REASON WHY IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO INCLUDE THIS IS TRAILER BILL -- THE CRUEL FLYING JERAS TO IS THAT A JUDGE WHO LEAVES A DAY BEFORE REACHING THE MANDATORY RETIREMENT AGE LOSES MORE THAN HALF OF THEIR RETIREMENT -- AS AN EXAMPLE. I HAVE FULLY FUNDED MY A SHARE OF THAT SYSTEM -- THAT SYSTEM IS ONE HUNDRED AND 2% FUNDED NOW UNLIKE VERY. MANY OTHER PUBLIC EMPLOYEE PENSION PROGRAMS. AND IT HAS BEEN FULLY FUNDED SINCE ITS INCEPTION. pESTIMATED BY CALPERS AND THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE AT TWENTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE LIFE OF THE PLAN THAT IS NOT A ONGOING BLEEDING. HOLE IN THE BUDGET THIS IS A TOTAL OF TWENTY ONE MILLION OVER THE LIFE OF THE PLAN IN ORDER TO MAKE THIS SMALL CHANGE TOO GENEROUS. TO THE PROBLEM WITH CHAIR AS TO IS THAT IF THE JUDGE DIES OR LEAVES A DAY BEFORE THEY REACH THE MANDATORY RETIREMENT AGE THEY LOSE THEIR DEFINED BENEFIT FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR SPOUSE -- I TRUST YOU ARE IN RECEIPT OF JUDGE HER OVER -- RATHER. NOT SENATOR MORE LOCKS A BUDGET REQUEST AND THE LETTER HOPEFULLY FROM A PRESIDENT OF THE ALLIANCE A CALIFORNIA JUDGE STEVE WHITE. THAT GAVE SOME RATHER HORRIFYING EXAMPLES OF HOW THIS THING AFFECT PEOPLE JUDGES LITERALLY EXTENDING THEIR LIVES ON CHEMOTHERAPY AND OTHERWISE. AT TO REACH RETIREMENT AGE SO THAT THEIR FAMILIES ARE NOT LEFT WITH LESS THAN HALF OF WHAT THEY LEARNED. IT'S A SMALL ASK IT'S IT'S DESIGNED ONLY TO REACH THOSE UNIQUE CASES WHERE JUDGES NEED TO LEAVE. EITHER BECAUSE THEY'RE BURNED OUT THERE PHYSICALLY UNABLE TO CONTINUE THE JOB THEY'RE FACING A LIFE CRISIS OR FAMILY MEMBERS FACING. ONE WITHOUT JUDGES WATCH THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS FADE AWAY DUE TO ALZHEIMER'S HAVING TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY CAN GET A BENEFIT FOR THEM. NOT KNOWING HOW LONG THEY MIGHT LIVE UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS WE'VE HAD JUDGES EXTENDING THEIR LIVES WITH CHEMOTHERAPY THOSE EXAMPLES ARE CITED OUR LETTER AND THERE ARE COUNTLESS OTHERS. I JUST LEARNED THIS MORNING OF A JUDGE IN SAN DIEGO SIXTY YEARS OLD JUST DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER. I TO FIGURE OUT HOW SHE'S GOING TO MAKE IT FIVE YEARS TO GET TO RETIREMENT. WE ARE ASKING FOR NOTHING MORE THAN WHAT EVERY OTHER PUBLIC EMPLOYEE IN CALIFORNIA HAS WHICH IS A RIGHT. TO YEARS OF SERVICE AT AGE OF RETIREMENT. IF A JUDGE LEAVES THE JUDGE GETS NOT A DOLLAR MORE NOT A DAY SOONER UNDER THIS PROPOSAL. THE JUDGE WOULD LEAVE WITHOUT A PAYCHECK WITHOUT A RETIREMENT CHECK IN IF THEY CHOOSE TO DO SO WOULD PAY FOR THEIR OWN HEALTH BENEFITS WHILE THEY AWAIT THE CHECK THAT ULTIMATELY COMES TO THEM OR THEIR SURVIVORS. AT THE NORMAL RETIREMENT DATE. THE VERY SMALL REQUEST WE CERTAINLY HOPE THAT YOU'LL CAREFULLY CONSIDER PUTTING IT INTO THAT BUDGET SO WE CAN GET THIS DONE BEFORE ANOTHER JUDGE FACES THAT COOLS THE CIRCUMSTANCE THANK YOU THANK YOU EVERY SERVICE -- CONSIDERING THE NUMBER OF OF VISITORS WE HAVE YOUR IF WE COULD LEAVEIT TO A MAX OF TWO MINUTES OUT REALLY APPRECIATED THANK YOU VERY MUCH. PLEASE. NICOLE ORNAMENT ON BEHALF OF THE ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN STRONG SUPPORT OF ISSUE NUMBER FIFTY THREE THE FORTY MILLION DOLLARS GOING INTO A ORANGE COUNTY HOUSING FINANCE FRONT.

SPARKY HARLAN CEO BILL WILSON CENTER IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY SPEAKING TO ITEM FORTY THREE THE HOMELESS YOUTH HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR FUNDING. I SPEAK TO THIS BECAUSE SANTA CLARA COUNTY CURRENTLY PROVIDES LESS THAN 5% OF ITS FUNDING FOR HOMELESS YOUTH. AND CONSIDERS IT A LOW PRIORITY EVEN THOUGH THE LAST POINT IN TIME COUNT. HOMELESS YOUTH REPRESENTED 40% OF THE HOMELESS POPULATION. INDICATIONS ARE IT'S GOING TO GO UP 50% IN THIS CURRENT POINT IN TIME COUNT. BEING CLOSE TO FOUR THOUSAND WE NEED TO HAVE A PRIORITY STATEWIDE ON HOMELESS YOUTH BECAUSE FRANKLY THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS JUST DO NOT DO THAT FOR THE HEAT MONEY. EVEN THOUGH THE COUNTY BROADBAND ELEVEN MILLION BASED ON OUR pACCOUNT FOR YOU. THEY GAVE A MILLION TO YOU IF WE HAD GOTTEN THAT TOTAL PERCENTAGE SO WHEN YOU CONSIDER HEAT MONEY IF YOU SAY A MINIMUM FOR YOU OR BASED ON YOUR POINT IN TIME COUNT. THAT WOULD BE A HUGE BENEFIT TO US TO GET MORE MONEY FOR HOMELESS YOU CURRENTLY MOST OF OUR MONEY FOR HOMELESS YOUTH EITHER COMES FROM CALLOW YES. OR FEDERAL HUD BUT NOT LOCAL JURISDICTION SO PLEASE SUPPORT THIS REQUEST THANK YOU.

GOOD AFTERNOON SHARON REPORT WITH THE CORPORATION FOR SUPPORT OF HOUSING -- WE ALSO SUPPORT INCREASE INVESTMENT AND USE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS WAS GLAD TO SEE THAT THE FRAMEWORK. HOWEVER WE DO HAVE CONCERNS AND I GUESS I MAYBE. I'M GOING TO TRY AND TALK YOU OUT OF ADOPTING THE FRAMEWORK AROUND THE HOMELESS PROVISIONS AS A WHOLE -- WE HAVE CONCERNS WITH PUTTING MORE MONEY INTO THE HOMELESS EMERGENCY AID PROGRAM. WE DO SEE HOMELESSNESS IS A CRISIS WITH -- OVER NINE HUNDRED PEOPLE DYING ON THE STREETS OF LOS ANGELES ALONE LAST YEAR -- WE THINK OF HOMELESSNESS IS A MORAL CRISIS DECADES IN THE MAKING THAT WILL TAKE -- COMPREHENSIVE THOUGHTFUL APPROACH TO ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS -- AND WE DO NOT THINK THAT A TEMPORARY EMERGENCY RESPONSE THROUGH THE HOMELESS EMERGENCY AID PROGRAM IS THE RIGHT RESPONSE. I WELL WE APPRECIATE THE RECOMMENDATIONS TO BEGIN A DIALOGUE AND WOULD LOVE TO BEGIN THE BILL BE PART OF THAT DIALOGUE AROUND A COMPREHENSIVE RESPONSE. WE ALREADY KNOW WHAT WORKS TO SOLVE HOMELESSNESS WE KNOW FROM -- LOTS OF RESEARCH DECADES OF RESEARCH AND AND WHAT HAS WORKED AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL -- AND IT'S AND THERE'S NO TIME LIKE THE PRESENT ACTUALLY BEGIN TO PUT SOME OF THOSE -- PROVEN SOLUTIONS AND MOTIONS THIS YEAR -- AS JUST MENTION THE BIG CITY MAYORS AND A COALITION OF OVER SIXTY FIVE HOMELESS ADVOCATES ARE PROPOSING AN INVESTMENT OF ONE BILLION DOLLARS -- AND THIS IS A LESS THAN ONE HALF OF 1% OF OF THIS YEAR'S STATE BUDGET. THE FLEXIBLE POOL FOR HOUSING AND SERVICES BALANCES A CRISIS RESPONSE WITH LONG TERM SOLUTIONS PROVEN TO SOLVE HOMELESSNESS -- THIS POOL IS THE FIRST STEP IN THE STATE CAN TAKE TO GET PEOPLE OFF THE STREET NOW IT ALSO INCLUDES AGGRESSIVE TIME LINES FOR GETTING THE MONEY OUT QUICKLY -- AND MORE IMPORTANTLY IT IS A STEP TOWARD A MORE COMPREHENSIVE RESPONSE THIS YEAR WITHOUT DELAYING IMPLEMENTING OF WHAT WHAT WE NOW WORKS TO SOLVE HOMELESSNESS SO I URGE YOU TO CONSIDER THIS PROPOSAL AS AN ALTERNATIVE. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND FINALLY -- CHRIS MARTIN WITH HOUSING CALIFORNIA WANT TO ALIGN MYSELF WITH THE PREVIOUS TWO SPEAKERS WHERE -- A PART OF THAT COALITION -- WITH THE BIG CITY MAYORS AND AND HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS ADVOCATES -- BUT JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE NEED FOR MORE LONG TERM. APPROACH TO OUGHT TO HOMELESSNESS GETTING PEOPLE INTO HOUSING-- THE FLEXIBLE THAT WAS MENTIONED IS A POOL THAT COULD GET PEOPLE OFF THE STREETS IMMEDIATELY BUT ALSO KEEP THEM HOUSE ON THE LONG TERM SO WE BELIEVE THAT'S A WAY TO SOLVE BOTH OF THE THE NEEDS OF THE IMMEDIATE NEED AND KEEP PEOPLE HOUSE -- LONG TERM IN AND LOOK FORWARD TO AND HOPE TO BE A PART OF THE DISCUSSION AROUND A LONG TERM SOLUTION THANKS. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH OKAY. SHOW UP AND THEN I HEARD WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT LONG TERM SOLUTIONS VERSUS ONE TIME FIXES -- THIS IS A CONTINUING CONVERSATION THIS ISSUE IS NOT GOING TO GO AWAY. OF SOMETHING WE NEED TO FOCUS ON FOR A LONG. TIME -- HAVING SAID THAT I MOVE TO APPROVE THE SENATE FRAMEWORK ADOPT PLACEHOLDER TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO IMPLEMENT FRAMEWORK WELCOME. SENATOR RAZA I NIELSEN SENATOR UMBERG. THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR COMING OKAY -- YEAH. IN. ORDER ALL RIGHT SO [inaudible] OKAY. SO MADAM CHAIR -- IN ORDER FOR FOLKS TO BUILD FOCUS THEIR COMMENTS I WANT TO COMMENT ON ISSUE NUMBER SEVENTY TWO AND NUMBER -- SEVENTY THREE ISSUE NUMBER SEVENTY TWO OF ONE OF THE QUESTIONS ALL HAVE IS. HOW IT IS -- SIMILAR TO THE CALIFORNIA JOB CHALLENGE ACADEMY AT LASALLE MIDDLE SO VISITED THAT LOCATION EXTREMELY IMPRESSED. SO IF YOU COULD COMMENT ON THAT -- I'M INCLINED TO SUPPORT BOTH THOSE MEASURES SAUL LET YOU TALK ME OUT OF THAT IF YOU'RE INCLINED -- MAY BE EXPLAINED THE SIMILARITIES AND THE MANAGER IF THAT'S OKAY WITH YOU WE'LL GO FROM THERE. SO. YEAH -- WILL BE TIGHT ON TIME IN TERMS OF THE ISSUES THAT NEED TO VOTE SO. WE WANNA MOVE FORWARD SO -- THE NEXT ITEM IS THE DISCOVERY -- CHALLENGE ACADEMY EXPANSION OVER ONE OUT WELCOME MADE GENERAL BALDWIN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE MAJOR. THANK YOU SENATOR I AM A DEFAULT ON ON THE EDGE IN GENERAL I RUN THE MILITARY DEPARTMENT AND IN THE TO BE BRIEF ALL JUST ANSWER CENTER IN BERKS QUESTION THE PROGRAMS RIGHT DENTICLE SO WE RUN THREE CHALLENGE PROGRAMS ONE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AT LOS ALAMITOS. WANNA CANCELLOUS MISSPOKE AND THE WITH OUR NEWEST ONE IS THE ONE THE DISCOVERY ONE THAT'S IN A LATE THREATEN THAT SERVES THE SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY BORDER UP FOR OF EDUCATION. SO AGAIN I'M I'M I'M INTERESTED WHAT THE PER FINANCES SAY IN LA -- BUT I WOULD LIKE TO VISIT THOSE OTHER FACILITIES SO. ADDING THAT CAVIAR -- LET IF YOU DON'T MIND THAT I'M SURE WE'LL HEAR FROM FINANCE AND LA -- AND THEN [inaudible] BEFORE. THE LAST WORD PARTNER FINANCE WE HAVE NOTHING THAT AT THE STANFORD. FOR A FURTHER -- SEVENTY TWO PULLING HER TO THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS WITH THE DISCOVERY CHALLENGE PROGRAM AS YOU INDICATED ON THERE'S ACTUALLY QUITE A BIT OF EVIDENCE ON THAT PROGRAM AND WERE VERY COMFORTABLE THAT PROPOSAL. I'M WITH REGARD TO THE SECOND PROPOSAL -- WITH REGARD TO THAT JOB CHALLENGE PROGRAM -- WE THINK IT'S VERY PROMISING THERE BEEN A COUPLE OF PILOT PROGRAMS THREE PILOT PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN DONE IN OTHER STATE. OTHER STATES EXCUSE ME THERE'S LIMITED DATA AVAILABLE AT THIS POINT THERE'S SOME VERY PROMISING DATA BUT IT'S PRETTY LIMITED AND SO OUR RECOMMENDATION WAS JUST -- TO HAVE THE DEPARTMENT REPORT BACK ON I'M WHAT ITS PLANS COULD BE FOR EVALUATING THE SUCCESS THAT PROGRAM ON A ONGOING BASIS THAT WAY THE LEGISLATURE CAN ENSURE THAT IT'S ACHIEVING THE INTENDED OUTCOMES. THANK YOU I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF I SHOULD BE SHORT OF QUESTIONS IS I NOTICED IN TERMS OF THE THE STAFFING -- THAT YOU'VE INCLUDED A RECRUITER POSITION -- WHICH I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT SEEMS LIKE WITH ALL THE NEEDS THAT YOU HAVE. OF THE EURO YOU REALLY NEED A RECRUITER AS MUCH AS YOU DO. OTHER STAFF IN SO -- I'M NOT SURE WHY. WITH WITH THE SUCCESS THAT YOU'RE HAVING AN IS -- WAIT. THE WAIT LIST. RUMORS A WAIT LIST AT ALL LEVELS THE FROM THE FUNCTION OF THAT INDIVIDUAL IS MORE OF AN ADMISSIONS COORDINATOR. WHAT THEY DO IS ONCE THEIR PARENTS EXPRESSED INTEREST AND WE RUN THROUGH OUR LOTTERY SYSTEM TO SELECT WHICH? STUDENTS ARE TO BE ABLE TO ATTEND THEY THEN ASSIST THE THE PARENTS OF THE GUARDIANSOF THE POTENTIAL STUDENT TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE ALL THE PAPERWORK ALL THE REQUIRED DOCUMENTATION. THEY NEED TO COMMAND SO IT'S PRETTY IMPORTANT -- POSITIONS TO HELP DO THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE INTAKE SO IT'S VERY MUCH AN ADMINISTRATIVE POSITION AS OPPOSED TO SOMEONE THAT'S GOING OUT -- TO GO FIND PEOPLE WHO HAVE INTEREST IN THE PROGRAM BECAUSE AS YOU MENTIONED THE PROGRAMS ARE. ARE WAY OVER SUBSCRIBED YEAH. AND THEN ON THE SECOND -- YOU TALK ABOUT CERTIFICATES THAT THE STUDENTSWOULD EARN COULD YOU JUST QUICKLY. DESCRIBE HOW HOW THAT SERVES TO GET. INTO A REAL CAREER OR A JOB PLACEMENT FOR WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP RIGHT NOW WITH -- TO COMMUNITY COLLEGES -- CYPRESS COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND THEN LONG BEACH CITY COLLEGE IN ORDER TO DO -- CERTIFICATION PROGRAMS FOR TRADES WILL ALSO WORK WITH -- TRADE UNIONS IN THE AREA TO TO DETERMINE WHAT THE DEMAND IS FOR EMPLOYMENT IN. IN -- SEVERAL JOB FIELDS AND THEN MANY OF THOSE JOB FEELS REQUIRE WAR IT ENHANCES THE THE MARKETABILITY OF THE CANDIDATE IF THEY COME OUT OF THE PROGRAM WITH A CERTIFICATE IN WHATEVER CAREER FIELD THE GOING INTO. OKAY [inaudible] YES. BUT I'M SURE WE FINISHED YES -- THE QUESTION WITH RESPECT TO CYPRUS IN LONG BEACH CITY COLLEGE -- ARE. ARE ANY PARTS THE PROGRAM GOING TO BE OPERATED AT THE LOCATION OR IS IT. INDIVIDUALS ARE GOING TO COME BELOW SELL NEEDLES CENTER FOR FOR FORGET ALL MAKE SURE WE GET WITH YOUR STAFF AND TO IMITATE EXTEND AN INVITATION FOR YOU AND I CAN VISIT THE OTHER SCHOOLS BUT THE STUDENTS WILL LIVE AND DO THEIR PHYSICAL TRAINING REQUIREMENTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT LOS. ALAMITOS WILL TRANSPORT THEM TO THE SCHOOL CAMPUSES WHERE THEY'LL ACTUALLY DO THE THE CLASSROOM WORK WHICH HELPS US TO BECAUSE THEN WE DON'T HAVE TO SET ASIDE ADDITIONAL CLASSROOM SPACE. AT OUR BASE SO THAT'S PART OF THE AGREEMENT THAT WE'VE DONE IN THE SCHOOLS. AND IF I COULD -- JUST ADDRESS BRIEFLY THE LA OWES I THINK THE ONLY A SUGGESTION OF DOING A LONGITUDINAL STUDY. TO TRACK THE EFFICACY THE PROGRAM IS GOOD WE WOULD WELCOME THAT. ON WHAT WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT INITIALLY AND WE CAN HAVE FOR THE TALKS ON A BOAT -- WERE OPEN TO TRACKING MAYBE FOR THE FIRST YEAR HOW MANY THE PEOPLE TO COMPLETE THE PROGRAM ACTUALLY GET HIRED IN THE TRADES FOR WHICH THEY TRAINED. AND THEN A LONGITUDINAL STUDY THAT GOES PERHAPS TEN YEARS OUT -- THAT TRACKS DID THEY STAY IN THEIR CAREER FIELD TO THE GO MOVE INTO A BETTER CAREER FIELD OR SO SOME OF THE PROBLEM. THE OTHER IDEA THAT THE LA -- HAD THAT I REALLY LIKE ALSO IS TO ALSO. YOU ATTRACT THE STUDENTS TO GRADUATE FROM OUR REGULAR CHALLENGE PROGRAMS BUT DON'T GOING TO THE JOB CHALLENGE PROGRAM. AND SEE IF THE KIDS TO GO THROUGH THE JOB CHALLENGE PROGRAM HAVE GREATER SUCCESS IN THEIR FIRST EN YEARS OF THE CAREER THEN. THE STUDENTS THAT MERELY GO THROUGH THE HIGH SCHOOL EQUIVALENCY PROGRAM. ON BECAUSE IN THAT CASE IS A GOOD CONTROL TO SEE -- HOW WELL THIS NEW PROGRAM IS WORKING? I CAN -- CAM MOVE. PLEASE COME DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO I THINK I WOULD HAVE THE OUT THERE IS THAT -- WHILE THE LONGER TERM THE IT IS IMPORTANT THAT ACTUALLY REQUIRES PROBABLY A BIT OF RESOURCES AND SORT OF BEING STAFFED UP TO BE A FIFTEEN THAT INFORMATION SO I THINK IN THE NEAR TERM. WEWOULD PRIORITIZE FOCUSING ON WHAT JOBS FOLKS GET INTO. IN TERMS OF THE TRACKING IN TERMS OF THE TRACKING YEAH I THINK LONG TERM WE CAN HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT YOU KNOW WHERE PEOPLE GO AND WHAT FEELS THEY EXPAND INTO BUT IN THE NEAR TERM WE'RE NOT REALLY RESOURCE TO DO THAT. OR SET UP TO DO THAT. OKAY WHAT I WANT LONG DISCUSSION BUT I I THINK THAT'S CRITICAL IN TERMS OF ACCOUNTABILITY IS ENSURING THAT WHATEVER WE'RE DOING. ACTUALLY HAS SOME BENEFIT OVER THE LONG TERM SO I WOULD BE INTERESTED SOME POINT AND UNDERSTANDING. WHAT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES WOULD BE REQUIRED TO BE ABLE TO ADD THAT KIND OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY? SO I I GET NOT FOR TODAY BUT NO YEAH I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE CLEAR THAT WE COULD MAYBE WE WOULD MAKE MY NEED TO COME BACK IN THE FUTURE. SOMETHING OF THAT MAGNITUDE THAT WOULD BE GOOD TO DO THE EXIT YOUR EARLIEST OPPORTUNITY SO. OF SALT ALFA MOVE THE OF ITEM SEVENTY TWO ISSUE NUMBER. SEVENTY TWO OF MOVES -- COULD PROVE IT [inaudible] OKAY. BY. LOCAL ENERGY DORADO HI SENATOR NIELSEN. SENATOR UMBERG. OKAY THE WORLD IN OPEN SEVENTY THREE WE'RE GONNA HOLD OPEN HOLD ON FOR FAMILY PLANNING THANK YOU THANK YOU RENDON'S AS A THANK YOU FOR SELF -- WE'RE GONNA. WE'RE GONNA JUMP TO ITEM SEVENTY FIVE WHICH IS A SIMILAR DEVELOPMENT CENTER. ON ITEM -- SEVENTY FIVE IF THE IF YOU COULD. SPEAK TO THIS UP I I'M INCLINED TO ACT ACTUALLY MOVED. TO APPROVE THIS MATTER -- SO WITH WITH BUDGET REPORTING LANGUAGE ON THE STATUS OF THE PROPER THE COUNTY MEETING GOALS AND THE PROGRESS TO THE COMMISSION THE SITE THAT'S WHAT I'M INCLINED TO DO. SO YOU'RE GONNA TELL ME WHY I'M WRONG HEADED [inaudible] THE UNITED. NO NO -- THANK YOU -- JASON KIDD HIM APARTMENT JOURNAL SERVICES I OVERSEE OUR REAL ESTATE DIVISION -- YES OF THE PROPOSAL IS OF SOMEONE STRAIGHTFORWARD IT'S SEEKING FUNDING TO MAINTAINING NINE HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE ACRE CAMPUS IN CINEMA FOR THREE YEARS -- AND THEN SUCCESSFULLY DISPOSITION THE PROPERTY IN A WAY THAT BENEFITS BOTH THE STATE pAND SUPPORT THE LOCAL COMMUNITY -- THIS IS THE OLDEST OF THE DON'T KNOW CENTERS IT WAS -- ORIGINALLY CONSTRUCTED IN EIGHTEEN NINETY ONE IN SERIES OF WAVES -- AND THE FACILITIES BE ON ITS USEFUL LIFE ULTIMATELY -- WHAT WOULD HAPPEN HERE IS THE FUNDING WOULD ALLOW DDS TO CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN THE CAMPUS AND -- SHUT DOWN -- HE REDUCTION OF FROM THEIR THEIR CURRENT LEVELS OF OPERATION THE LAST PATIENT THE TO LEAVE THE SITE IN DECEMBER -- TWENTY EIGHTEEN HOWEVER THE FUNDING THE PROPOSAL ALSO INCLUDES FUNDING FOR THE CAUCUSES THAT THE COUNTY OF CINEMA TO REZONE THE PROPERTY -- THAT IS SOMEWHAT UNUSUAL -- FOR PROPOSAL LIKE THIS HOWEVER -- THE WAY THAT PROP THE PROPERTY IS CURRENTLY ZONED REDUCE THE VALUE CONSIDERABLY -- THE FUNDING IS TO HELP THE COUNTY EXPEDITE THE PROCESS -- IN TERMS OF THE COST OF A THREE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THE DIFF THE AMOUNT OF MAINTENANCE MONEY TO SAVE HOWEVER OVER THE DURATION IS ABOUT FORTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS SO IT'S A GREAT RETURN ON INVESTMENT TO TO FUND THIS -- ULTIMATELY THIS IS -- THE RESULT OF NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE STATE THE COMMUNITY INCLUDING LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS THE NUMBER OF THE LEGISLATURE. ON INCLUDING CENTER DOTS AND REQUIRE AN ASSEMBLYMEMBER AGUIAR-CURRY -- AND FINALLY THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND CINEMA HAVE ALSO -- RESOUNDINGLY SUPPORT THE PROPOSAL -- THEY PASSED A RESOLUTION APRIL FIFTH -- SHOWING THEIR SUPPORT AND AUTHORIZING STAFF TO BEGIN WORK ON THE PLANNING PROCESS AND HER HERE [inaudible] OKAY. AND WE HAVE A MOTION LA YOU. BUT A HUNG CHRISTINE SO WE HAVE A FEW COMMENTS -- UNDERSTAND THAT THIS HAS BEEN THE THE RESULT OF QUITE AN EXTENSIVE PROCESS -- BUT THERE ARE SOME TWEAKS THAT WE WOULD SUGGEST THAT WE THINK WOULD HELP IMPROVE SOME LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT OVER THIS PROCESS I'M GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT'S INVOLVED IN REALLY -- THAT THE FACT IT IS A VERY LARGE PROPERTY I'M SO THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE HAVE INCLUDE FIRST -- LIMITING FUNDING TO NINETEEN TWENTY SO ON THIS PROPOSAL WOULD PROVIDE FUNDING FOR THREE YEARS TO THIS WE WOULD RECOMMEND JUST FINDING THE NINETEEN TWENTY ABOUT HAVING TO COME BACK NEXT YEAR. A COUPLE REASONS FOR THIS ONE WE THINK THAT THERE'S SOME UNCERTAINTY ABOUT WHAT THAN THAT OUT YOUR COSTS ARE GONNA BE THAT WOULD GIVE THE UP THE LEGISLATURE THE OPPORTUNITY TO REEVALUATE THOSE COSTS IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS. AND WE ALSO THINK I'M JUST HAVING THEM REPORT BACK AT THAT TIME ABOUT THE STATUS OF THAT PROJECT AND AND THE DISPOSITION WOULD BE HELPFUL SO WE CAN THAT'S A NICE CHECK AND SECONDS -- WE'RE RECOMMENDING HAVING THAT THE FUNDING FOR CINEMA COUNTY BE DONE ON A REIMBURSEMENT BASIS IN PART BECAUSE THE DEAD STATE DOESN'T USUALLY -- FUND THIS TYPE OF ACTIVITY AND SO -- IT'S IT'S DIFFICULT TO VERIFY WITH CERTAINTY WHETHER THIS IS EXACTLY RIGHT FUNDING AMOUNTS WE THINK OF REIMBURSEMENT BASIS WOULD BE APPROPRIATE -- THIRD WERE SUGGESTING -- AN AMENDMENT TO THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE -- THAT COULD FURTHER SPECIFY THE LEGISLATURE'S GOALS FOR THE PROPERTY SO CURRENTLY SO -- ALONG WITH THE BUDGET PROPOSAL THERE'S TRAILER BILL AND THAT'S PROPOSED WHICH WOULD BASICALLY EXEMPT THIS PROPERTY FROM THE TRADITIONAL SURPLUS PROPERTY PROCESS WHICH WHICH HAS SORT OF A LOADING ORDER FOR THINGS YOU KNOW WAYS AT FIRST THAT PROPERTY IS MADE AVAILABLE. TO YOU KNOW WHEN USE THAN THE NEXT AND THE NEXT ON THE TO CREATE AN ALTERNATIVE PROCESS I'M CERTAINLY THERE'S A RATIONALE FOR USING AN ALTERNATE PROCESS IN THIS IN THIS CASE -- BUT THE LANGUAGE IS PRETTY BROAD AND IT GIVES QUITE A BIT OF AUTHORITY TO THE DEPARTMENT DIRECTOR -- AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAD MORE SPECIFIC GOALS FOR THE PROPERTY FOR EXAMPLE RELATED TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING OR THE THIS -- DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED COMMUNITY IT COULD FURTHER SPECIFY THOSE -- JUST TO GIVE A LITTLE BIT MORE -- DIRECTION IF IT'S INTERESTED IN DOING. AND THEN -- WE'RE ALSO RECOMMENDING I MIGHT FIND A TRAILER BILL. LOOK LANGUAGE TO PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL OVERSIGHT -- ONE POSSIBILITY FOR EXAMPLE IS TO REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT I HAD TO DO A DEAL BE SEATED LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE NOTIFICATION PRIOR TO ENTERING INTO A LONG TERM LEASE OR THE SALE. ON THAT WOULD GIVE THE LEGISLATURE JUST A CHECK AND SO I COULD SEE COULD. EVALUATE WHETHER. IT'S COMFORTABLE WITH THE PROPOSED APPROACH FOR THE SOUTH. AND THEN THE FINAL COMMENT WE HAD IS FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER WHETHER IT'S COMFORTABLE WITH SETTING POTENTIALLY SETTING A PRECEDENT ON FOR THIS PROCESS FOR THIS PROPERTY SO THIS IS A LITTLE BIT UNUSUAL. PROCESS -- IT'S ALSO AN UNUSUAL SET AMOUNT OF MONEY AND AND SOME OF THE THINGS ARE FINDING OUR LAW AND USUAL -- AND SO -- CERTAINLY THERE ARE SOME UNIQUE ASPECTS OF THIS PROPERTY IT'S VERY LARGE IT HAS SOME VERY OLD. BUILDINGS THAT HAS SOME HIS -- SOME WILDLIFE ISSUES AND AND ALSO THE COMMUNITY THAT WAS AFFECTED BY THE WILDFIRES. CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT -- AND ALL THESE DIFFERENT FACTORS BUT CERTAINLY OTHER COMMUNITIES COULD ALSO -- COULD ALSO ARGUE THAT THEIR UNIQUE THINGS AND SO REALLY TO THEIR COMMUNITY SO WE JUST WANTED TO FIND OUT FOR HE LEGISLATURE'S WHILE. ON BECAUSE BECAUSE THIS COULD BE SOMETHING OTHER COMMUNITIES ASK. FOR DID YOU WANT. TO RESPOND TO YOU GUYS ARE GOOD BECAUSE I MEAN I YEAH I THINK I CAN JUST ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE SOME IS ALTERNATELY -- I THINK THE REPORTING LANGUAGE AS MENTIONED -- IS IS A HELP IN MAKING SURE THAT THERE IS REGULAR REPORTING ACCOUNTABILITY ON THE SPENDING OF FUNDS -- I THINK ALSO -- TO IS RELATED TO ME. THAT'S BECAUSE YOU HAVE BETTER THANK YOU -- THE IN TERMS OF THIS THE THE PARITY WITH THE STATE'S EXISTING SURPLUS PROPERTY PROCESS -- YES THERE'S A THERE'S SOMETHING A LOADING ORDER EXISTING GOVERNMENT CODE HOWEVER THE SAME -- OBJECTIVES ARE LISTED IN THE TRAILER BILL -- MUST HAVE THIS PROPERTY IS GONNA BE LARGELY SUBJECT TO THE ZONING PROCESS AND SO THE STATE WILL BE AGGRESSIVELY PURSUING HOUSING A COMMERCIAL VIABILITY IN USE -- AND SO THOSE THINGS WILL STILL BE ADDRESSED THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS THERE'S ALSO A PREFERENCE FOR A HOUSING FOR THOSE. DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED AS WELL -- THERE WILL ALSO -- IN WHEN THE STATE TRADITIONALLY DISPOSE OF PROPERTY THE EXISTING AUTHORITY GIVEN TO THE DIRECTOR IS ACTUALLY ALSO QUITE BROAD -- TO SOMETHING PROPOSED BY THE LA WOULD BE -- DEVIATIONS IN THE NORMAL WAY WHICH THE PROPERTIES -- DISPOSED OF THANK YOU. OKAY. I WOULD WITH ANY THAT IS A QUICK QUESTION ABOUT THE THE ONE YEAR VERSUS THREE YEAR. ISSUE SO PARTLY. IT'S BECAUSE OF OF CITING KNOWN SO THE WAY THE COSTS WERE GENERATED WERE OF BECAUSE GOOD WITH THE ONE YEAR -- IT IT WOULD BE -- OUR PREFERENCE AGO FOR THE THE THREE YEARS ULTIMATELY -- IT ALLOWS FOR GREATER FLEXIBILITY -- IN DISPOSITION THE CAMPUS -- MAINTAINING THE CAMPUS AS WELL IT ALSO SUCH A CLEAR MESSAGE TO THE COUNTY AND LOCALES AT ONE FIVE FOUR THREE OKAY PUBLIC COMMENT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR SENATOR JORDAN LINDSAY WITH THE ARK OF CALIFORNIA NOTICEABLE PULLS THE CALIFORNIA COLLABORATIVE I'M ALSO THE CHAIR OF THE LAMBING COALITION WHICH IS A BROAD COALITION MORE THAN TWENTY STATEWIDE ORGANIZATIONS. REPRESENTING ADVOCATING FOR THE THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS DRUG CALIFORNIA. THAT ARE SERVED AND SUPPORTED AS ENTITLED UNDER THE LANHAM ACT -- IN THE CINEMA DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER AS WE'VE HEARD MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED YEARS HAS BEEN PART OF THE DDS SYSTEM. AND WE AT THE ARE CALIFORNIA ADVOCATE FOR THE CLOSURE OF INSTITUTIONS ABOUT LITTLE CENTERS **** THE CALIFORNIA THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. AND WE'RE HAPPY THAT THAT PROCESS IS HAPPY NOT JUST -- FOR SNOW MOTHERS TO MORE -- ONE IN COSTA MESA ONE PORTERFIELD AND THOSE ARE ALSO SLATED TO BE CLOSED IN THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS. FOR YEARS HOWEVER OUR COMMUNITY HAS ADVOCATED THAT WHEN THESE ASSETS OR WHEN WE CLOSE THESE INSTITUTIONS IN WHICH WE HAVE DONE FOR SEVERAL OTHERS IN CALIFORNIA'S HISTORY. THAT THAT ACID SHOULD CONTINUE TO SERVE PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES I DON'T MEAN THAT WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO HAVE SERVICES ON THE SITE ITSELF THERE'S A LOT OF ISSUES IN HISTORY AND DRAMA. AND ALSO IN TRAUMA ASSOCIATED WITH THAT -- ALL WE ARE SAYING IS THAT REVENUE ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE ASSETS SHOULD BE USED TO BENEFIT CALIFORNIANS WITH INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPED TO DISABILITIES OTHER STATES HAVE DONE EXACTLY THIS. WE HAS ALSO DONE SOMETHING IN A IN COSTA MESA WITH PART OF THAT PROPERTY -- SIMILAR TO AND WHAT THE CONVERSATIONS THIS COMMITTEE IS HAD PREVIOUSLY NOW AT TODAY IS ABOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND ALL CALIFORNIANS ARE STRUGGLING TO FIND AFFORDABLE HOUSING IT'S SO MUCH MORE FOR CALIFORNIANS WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES WHO -- FACE THE HIGHEST AMOUNT OF WHEN IT COMES TO HUG VOUCHERS. DIFFICULTY AND DISCRIMINATION OF ANY COMMUNITY PEOPLE DISABILITIES. SO AS A RESULT THE LAN RECOLLECTION HAS PROPOSED THAT REVENUE ASSOCIATE WITH THE CLOSURE OF THESE ASSETS AND REMINISCES WITH THE DISPOSITION WHETHER IT'S A SALE OR LEASE. SHOULD BE USED TO FUND AFFORDABLE HOUSING OPTIONS FOR CALIFORNIANS WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOP THE DISABILITIES. IT'S BEEN A PART BUDGET PROPOSAL LAST YEAR A BILL LAST YEAR AND ALSO A BILL THIS YEAR TO DO EXACTLY THAT -- WE HAVE BEEN AVERAGING THAT FOR THE FOR YEARS AND WE ARE DISAPPOINTED THAT THAT IS NOT INCLUDED IN THIS PROPOSAL. IF THE GS WHICH IS TO SPEND MONEY ON A WARM SHUT DOWN AND ALSO GIVE MONEY TO THE COUNTY -- TO DEVELOP A PLAN SO BE IT THAT'S THE THAT'S THE STATE'S CHOICE TO DO SO HOWEVER WHEN THE PROPERTY HAS DISPOSITION WE ARE CONCERNED THAT IN THE ANALYSIS SAYS THAT THAT'LL BE USED TO RECOUP COSTS ASSOCIATED. WITH THE WARM SHUT DOWN WE BELIEVE THAT ANYTHING REVENUE ASSOCIATE WITH THE DISPOSSESSED DISPOSITION OF THIS PROPERTY SHOULD ABSOLUTELY BE USED TO BENEFIT CALIFORNIANS. WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES THE PROPOSALS TO BE USE THAT REVENUE PUT INTO A SPECIAL FUND THAT CAN BE USED SIMILAR TO OTHER HOUSING FUNDS. AND THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPER COMMUNITY IS READY TO GO ON THIS THE A WANT THIS FUND THEY WANT MONEY BE PUT INTO IT WHATEVER MECHANISM IS AVAILABLE AND THIS IS A REVENUE STREAM TO BE PUT INTO THAT FUND. TO ALLOW THROUGHOUT THE STATE AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT TO HAPPEN FOR PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPS IS PLEASE THANK YOU THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF MY NAME IS CARL LUNDEN I'M HERE TODAY REPRESENTING. THE ALLIANCE SUPPORTING PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL DEVOLVE DISABILITIES. LARSON ONE ECHO THE CONCERNS pRAISED BY JORDAN LINDSEY. OF THE ARE CAN YOU SEE P. COLLABORATIVE I WANT TO MAKE A JUST A COUPLE OF THE STATEMENTS. LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE HAS LOOKED AT THESE CLOSURES OF FINAL CLOSURES OF THESE PROPERTIES. AN ESTIMATED THAT THERE'S A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN SAVINGS. THAT'S GOING TO COME BACK TO THE GENERAL FUND AS A RESULT OF THESE CLOSURES WHY BECAUSE THE PEOPLE THAT LIVE THERE TODAY OR THAT LIVE THERE RECENTLY ARE NO LONGER GOING TO BE THERE AND NO LONGER SERVED. IN A STATE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER THAT MONEY GO SOMEWHERE. THE COMMUNITY MEANWHILE THE FLIP SIDE IN THIS IS A BUDGET SUB THREE ITEMS APPRECIATE THE DIFFICULTY IN EXPRESSING THIS TO YOU. BUT THE COMMUNITY IS BEING STIFFED AGAIN LARGELY IN THE STATE BUDGET. AND WE'VE HAD A HISTORY IN THE STATE NOW OF ONLY TWO RATE INCREASES FOR THE PROGRAMS OF SUPPORT PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS. SO WHAT WE HAVE SEEN AS JORDAN CORRECTLY NOTES AS A HISTORY IN THE STATE. OF CLOSURE OF THESE TREMENDOUS ASSETS. AND THE PROPERTIES BEING GIVEN AWAY AND THE OPERATING DOLLARS LEAVING THE SYSTEM AND NOT CONTINUE TO SUPPORT PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES. WE THINK IT'S A VERY SOON SEVERE PROBLEM WE HAVE ONE LAST CHANCE. TO GET THIS RIGHT THESE OF THE FINAL THREE PROPERTIES. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT WILL HAVE A DISPOSITION IN THIS AREA. AND WE WOULD LIKE TO URGE A PLAN THAT INVOLVES COMMUNITY AND DOESN'T RIGHT THIS TIME THERE'S NO REASON. THESE ASSETS SHOULD BE STRIPPED FROM THE COMMUNITY THE OPERATING DOLLARS TAKEN AWAY WITH NO BENEFIT TO THE COMMUNITY WE WOULD URGE YOU. TO KEEP THIS OPEN TO HAVE A FULLER DISCUSSION INVOLVING SUB. THREE AND OTHER LEADERSHIP AND AND LOOK TO YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS AIRING CARUTHERS. RECORD THE STATE COUNCIL ON DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. IN EIGHTEEN NINETY THE BEST THING TO DO FOR PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPING DISABILITIES WAS TO TAKE AWAY AND PUT HIM INTO A PLACE LIKE A DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER AN INSTITUTION WHERE. THAT'S WHERE THEY WOULD STAY IN% AND LORD IN CARE WAS PROVIDED TO THEM -- BY THE STATE. WE KNOW BETTER NOW AND WE APPRECIATE APPLAUD THE LEGISLATURE IN THE SENATE'S DIRECTION IN CLOSING DOWN THESE. VESTIGES OF WHAT ONCE WAS THE BEST WAY TO DO IT THE BEST WAY TO DO IT NOW TAKE CARE PEOPLE IS IN THE COMMUNITY -- WE KNOW THAT WE'RE MOVING PEOPLE TOWARD THE COMMUNITY THE CHALLENGES THAT WHEN PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY THEY'RE ACTUALLY NOT LIVING ON THEIR OWN. A 70% OF REGIONAL CENTER CLIENTS ARE LIVING WITH THEIR FAMILIES -- THAT FAMILIES ARE QUICKLY AGING OF THIS. ISSUE BRINGS UP AN OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT WHERE PEOPLE LIVE IN THE COMMUNITY AND STATE COUNCIL ASK YOU TO PLEASE CONSIDER THAT AS YOU CONSIDER THE DISPOSITION OF THIS PROPERTY THANK YOU. THANK YOU. TURNING NOT IN TURN MEMBERS KAREN LAYING ON BEHALF OF THE CINEMA COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS HAS BEEN AT THE TABLE -- WITH THEIR IT LEGISLATIVE DELEGATION DDS DDS FOR FOUR YEARS ON THIS TOPIC. THE HOME WAS CLOSED OUT BECAUSE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MADE A DECISION THAT THEY WERE GOING TO FIND CONGREGATE LIVING. ANYMORE AND THE STATE IS CLOSING THE CENTERS AS ARESULT OF A FEDERAL DECISION FROM FOUR YEARS AGO. SO THAT IS THE REASON HOMELESS CLOSING THE COUNTY HAS WORKED TOGETHER WITH THE COALITION ACTUALLY REPRESENTED THE PARENT HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION WHICH IN TURN IS AN ADVOCACY GROUP FOR THE RESIDENTS OF THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER AND THEY'VE ALL BEEN AT THE TABLE TOGETHER FOR FOUR YEARS. FIRST THE FOCUS IS ONE WAS ON THE RESIDENTS. THEN I WAS ON THE EMPLOYEES BECAUSE IS THE LARGEST EMPLOYER IN THE CINEMA VALLEY AND NOW WE'RE ON THE DISPOSITION OF THE PROPERTY THE STATUS SPENT TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS DEVELOPING HOMES FOR THE RESIDENTS USED TO LIVE THERE. THAT ARE NOW OUT IN THE COMMUNITY AND THE COUNTY HAS BEEN SUPPORTIVE EVERY STEP OF THE WAY WHAT'S BEFORE YOU TODAY. IS THE DISPOSITION OF THE PROPERTY I CAN ASSURE YOU THIS IS A TWO LANE ROAD. AND ON A THOUSAND ACRES SO IT'S NOT LIKE THE COSTA MESA PROPERTY WHICH IS INSIDE OF THE CITY LIMIT AND HAS EXISTING ZONING. THIS IS A HUGE PIECE OF PROPERTY THAT BACKS UP TO THE WILD IN URBAN INTERFACE TWENTY SOMETHING BUILDINGS I BELIEVE BURN IN. TWENTY EIGHTEEN SO IN THE BACK OF THE PROPERTY PROBABLY RIGHTFULLY NEEDS TO REMAIN OPEN SPACE THERE'S A CORE. I CENTER OF THE CAMPUS IS IT'S REFERRED TO THAT -- THIS THE CITY IS WITH THE COUNTY IS GOING TO WORK WITH I DID YES ON THE DEVELOP THE APPROPRIATE ZONING SO THAT WHEN DID ES TURNS AROUND TO SELL IT TO PRIVATE. INTERESTS THEY CAN EXTRACT THE HIGHEST PRICE POSSIBLE WHAT TO DO WITH THAT MONEY IS WHAT THE STATE IS GOING TO DO WITH THAT MONEY BUT THIS WILL GET YOU TO SOME SORT OF DISPENSATION WITH THE JAZZ. THAT THE COUNTY CAN LIVE WITH AND THEY KNOW THEY HAVE TO PUT HOUSING ARE AND I KNOW I HEARD THE HOMELESS AND HOUSING DISCUSSION FIRST.

HI MARSHA MINUTES APARTMENT A FINANCE ON JUST TO HIGHLIGHT A FEW THINGS THAT MISTER EDWARDS AND HAD PRESENTED THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO RIGHT SIZE THE UNIT I'M BASED ON THEIR EXISTING WORKLOAD HAS YET POINTED OUT THEY HAVE ABOUT TEN THOUSAND OPEN CASES WITH NINE STAFF MANAGING. A THOUSAND CASES WHICH IS -- IT'S DIFFICULT RIGHT I MEAN. AND SO -- YOU KNOW WE I THE THE STAFF COMMENTS NOTED THAT IT IS IT'S A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE BUT WE THINK OF IT AS A WE SEE IT AS ASTRATEGIC INVESTMENT AT LEAST IN THE AND IN THE FRONT END. TO ADDRESS THE THE BACKLOG OF CASES -- AND INSURE THAT WERE THOROUGHLY VETTING OUT THE APPLICATIONS AND THEN WERE OF COURSE ASSUMING THAT -- THE WORKLOAD WOULD DECREASE IN -- IN THE OUT YEARS AND THERE'S A CORRESPONDING REDUCTION AND AND IN IN SERVICES -- BASED ON THAT SO [inaudible] STERLING. GOOD AFTERNOON TEHAMA THE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE HAVE NO SPECIFIC COMMENTS ON THE PROPOSAL HAS -- PRESENTED I THINK THE ONE THING WE WOULD POINT OUT THAT IS INCLUDED IN THE AGENDA IS THAT EARLIER ON THERE WAS A ASSOCIATED TRAILER BILL WITH THIS PROPOSAL. THAT WOULD HAVE MADE CHANGES TO THE PROGRAM ITSELF ON THE SORT OF THE THE THE OTHER SIDE -- THAT WAS DESIGNED OR AT LEAST AS I UNDERSTAND IT -- TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE WORKLOAD -- THIS PROPOSAL NOW WOULD WOULD -- PROVIDE ADDITIONAL STAFF TO WORK ON THAT WORK WELL BUT I THINK THAT THE BIG OPEN QUESTION IS IF THE TRAJECTORY. OF THESE CASES CONTINUES TO INCREASE -- IT WE COULD BE HERE AGAIN IN THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS RECONSIDERING THAT THAT WORKLOAD. OKAY PUBLIC COMMENT. OKAY HEARING NONE THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE IT WILL EVEN THIS OPEN. OKAY WE'RE GOING. TO SEVENTY NINE OKAY ITEM SEVENTY NINE REGARDING SEXUAL HARASSMENT TRAINING FOR THE JANITORIAL INDUSTRY. THANK YOU MA'AM SURE THIS A TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE WILL HARMONIZE TWO SEPARATE BILLS A PAST -- IN RECENT YEARS -- AT A. B. NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT WHICH WAS PASSED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND SENATE BILL THIRTEEN FORTY THREE WHICH WAS PASSED. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN OF THEM UNFORTUNATELY. THESE THESE BILLS CREATED TWO SEPARATE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS TO THE SAME COMMUNITY COMMUNITY VIS CHANGES WILL HELP OUR HARMONIZE THAT AND THEN FOR FEEL -- WHAT WE BELIEVE IS THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF BOTH [inaudible] OKAY. OF HIS FINANCE LOW ALEJO'S. PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS PLEASE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR RENEE BY ARTEMISIA YOU CALIFORNIA WE SPONSORED AB NINETEEN SEVENTY WHICH IMPLEMENTED OF THIS REQUIREMENT AND WE SUPPORT THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THANKS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OKAY. ANYTHING YOU WANT. IT'S A QUESTIONS OF ANYONE. OKAY SO WE'RE GOOD. WE'LL LIKE BEING GOOD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU SO MUCH -- IT WILL BE DONE TO ISSUE. EIGHTY REGARDING THE GARMENT MANUFACTURERS SPECIAL ACCOUNT. SO I WILL -- BRIEFLY IN THE INTEREST OF TIME -- JUST TO ECHO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ARE IN OF THE AGENDA. I BELIEVE WE TESTIFIED ON THIS ISSUE A ONE THE EXECUTIVE COURT ORDER TO TRANSFER THREE POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE UNPAID WAY TRYING TO THE GARMENT RESTITUTION FUND. HAS BEEN EXECUTED. WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF CLOSING THOSE CASES AND APPEARING TO ISSUE CHECKS -- AS WE SPEAK -- OF THAT THE TRANSFER OF FROM THE PAID WHICH FUND -- TAKES THE OUTSTANDING CLAIM AMOUNT DOWN FROM ABOUT ELEVEN POINT -- TWO UNTIL -- APPROXIMATELY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN OUTSTANDING CLAIMS WE ARE WATCHING THE CLOCK A VERY -- CAREFULLY WE HAVE A CUT OFF THAT WE HAVE TO ABIDE BY IN IN ORDER TO CLOSE OUR BOOKS ON TIME THIS YEAR WITH THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S BUT WE WE ANTICIPATE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE. TO MAKE ONE MORE TRANSFER WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE DOLLAR VALUE OF THAT TRANSFER WILL BE YET -- BUT I DO NOT IN ANYWAY WANT TO IMPLY. THAT THAT TRANSFER WILL RESOLVE ALL THE OUTSTANDING CLAIMS BECAUSE IT WILL -- SO DOES THAT PUT INTO JEOPARDY THE CLAIMS MADE BY THE WORKERS THE NOT AT ALL NOT AT ALL UNFORTUNATELY IT SHOWS. UP MEANS THAT THAT THOSE WORKERS WHO ARE OLD THOSE WE JUST HAVE TO CONTINUE TO WAIT UNTIL WE COME UP WITH A PERMANENT SOLUTION THE B. C. P. THAT WAS PASSED LAST YEAR WAS ONLY. FOR A ONE TIME TRANSFER -- AT THE TIME THAT SEEMED TO BE UPROOTED DECISION BECAUSE WE HAVE SEEN AN UPTICK IN CLAIMS THAT WAS -- UNANTICIPATED -- AND WITH NO CONTEXT THE HISTORY SO WE DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER WE WERE LOOKING AT AN ABERRATION OR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A NEW PATTERN OVER THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS OR SO WHAT. WAS AT THE TIME OF FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLAR BACKLOG IN CLAIMS CHURNED INTO AN ELEVEN PLUS MILLION DOLLARS A BACKLOG AND CLEAN IN ONE YEAR SO IT'S EVIDENT EVEN THOUGH WE ONLY HAVE TWO YEARS IN WHAT APPEARS TO BE OUR NEW REALITY. IT'S EVIDENT THAT WE HAVE TO TAKE SOME LONG TERM PERMANENT ACTION WE WILL BE WORKING WITH THE LABOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AGENCY AND THE ADMINISTRATION -- TO DETERMINE -- THE BEST AND MOST APPROPRIATE WAY TO TO MOVE FORWARD OKAY. OFFICE OF FINANCE -- WE JUST WANTED -- ECHO THAT -- WE HAVE FIVE PROCESS AN EXECUTIVE ORDER TO TRANSFER THREE POINT NINE FIVE MILLION AND OF COURSE WERE WERE MONITORING CLOSELY TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW -- WE COULD -- TRANSFER IN ANOTHER AS MUCH AS WE CAN TO TO SUPPORT SOME OF THE EXISTING CLAIMS AND WILL WORK CLOSELY WITH HE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS TO ASSESS AND EVALUATE THE SUSTAINABILITY OF UP TO FIND. I MEAN IT IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THERE'S GOTTA BE A WAY TO PAY THIS OFF I MEAN WHY SHOULD THE PEOPLE WHO. GOT [inaudible] GET. IN THE FIRST PLACE UP TO WAIT SO LONG. AND AND WE NEED TO GET THAT DOLLAR FIGURE IS THAT WOULD WE DON'T HAVE A DOLLAR WE DO HAVE A FUND IS INSOLVENT. AND SO WHAT THE SEA CHANGE WAS CREATED BY TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE -- TWO YEARS AGO -- IN THE TWENTY SIXTEEN BUDGET ACTIVE ACTUALLY RAISED THE DAMAGES -- AND INCREASE THE AWARDS THAT CLAIM IT'S COULD RECEIVE AND SO WHAT WAS IN RETROSPECT WITH THE VALUE OF HINDSIGHT NOT ANTICIPATED AT THAT TIME IS OF THE BURDEN THAT WOULD PUT ON THE FEE STRUCTURE WHICH HASN'T BEEN REVISED IN DECADES SO. THAT OBVIOUSLY HAS TO BE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE LOOK AT AS A PRACTICE OF SOLUTIONS GOING THANK YOU. PUBLIC COMMENT PLEASE GOOD AFTERNOON.

YOU'VE JUST HEARD FROM OUR MEMBERS GARMENT WORKERS TO TRAVEL FROM LOS ANGELES OVERNIGHT. TO TELL YOU THEIR STORIES OF LABOR EXPLOITATION. WHAT WE'VE LEARNED FROM OUR MEMBERS AND WHAT WE'VE EARNED THROUGH OUR CLINIC IS HOW DIFFICULT AND RISKY IT CAN BE TO FOLLOW WAGE CLAIM? WORKERS NAVIGATE A COMPLICATED LEGAL SYSTEM. AND IN DOING SO THEY REST TERMINATION THEY RISK IMMIGRATION RELATED THREATS AND THEY RISK BLACKLISTING. THEY THEN WAIT THEY THEN CAN WAIT FOR UP TO TWO YEARS FOR THEIR CLAIM TO BE RESOLVED. AND WHEN THEY WIN THEIR WA AND THEY OFTEN FACE -- THE FACT THAT THE EMPLOYERS MANUFACTURERS DO NOT PAY UP. WORKERS THAT ARE TRYING TO THE GARMENT FIND IT WHERE THEY SAY AND A YEARS LONG WAITING LIST -- IN MEANWHILE THERE'S STRUGGLING AS YOU HEARD TO COVER RENT AND BASICALLY BEING EXPENSES. THE STATE CREATED THE GARMENT FUNDS AND IN DOING SO AGREED TO ACT AS THE PAIR OF LAST RESORT. TO GUARANTEE PAYMENT TO THIS VULNERABLE WORK FORCE. THE EXISTING WEIGHTLESS UNDERMINES THAT PURPOSE. ANY TO ROADS WORKERS TRUST IN GOVERNMENT. AND DISSUADES WORKERS FROM SEEKING TO RECOVER THEIR UNPAID WAGES. WE'RE VERY ENCOURAGED BY THE RECENT TRANSFER INTO THE GARMENT PLAN FUNDS THAT WILL PAY APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO WORKERS THIS IS REALLY EXCITING PROGRESS.

THREE FOUR FIVE YEARS AGO. ONE I SAY THAT YOU KNOW IN [inaudible] IN THE THEY WON THEIR CASE. BUT THEY DIDN'T WIN. BECAUSE THEY STILL HAVEN'T BEEN PAID -- AND IT TO BE TREATED THAT WAY AND THEN WHEN YOU GO TO OUR GOVERNMENT AND FILE A CLAIM WITH THE EXPECTATION. THAT. IF YOU WIN AGAIN IF YOU WIN YOUR CASE YOU'RE GOING TO GET PAID. SO THEY GO THROUGH THAT THEIR TRUST IN THE GOVERNMENT OUGHT TO DO THAT AND STILL. THEY DON'T GET PAID -- AND I THINK FOR THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE WITHIN OUR BUDGET WE'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT SO. WHATEVER THAT IS WHATEVER THAT AMOUNT IS WE SHOULD FIGURE OUT HOW TO MOVE THAT FORWARD BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE CAN'T IN GOOD CONSCIENCE. AS A STATE GOVERNMENT ALLOW THIS TO JUST KEEP HAPPENING THEY EXPECT. IF THEY DO WHAT THEY'RE TOLD TO DO A FILING THE CLAIM THEY EXPECT TO BE PAID. AND THEN I GETTING PAID.

DESPERATELY SEEKING THAT THE CAL OSHA -- THE ACCELERATES. AN UPDATE THE EXPOSURE LEVELS THEY HAVE NOT BEEN UPDATED FOR MANY MANY YEARS. I BELIEVE THAT THE INITIAL INTENT WAS TO START BACK IN. TWENTY ELEVEN AND THE REGULATION HAS NOT BEEN ADOPTED HAS NOT BEEN PUT IN PLACE. ALL I KNOW OF HAVE CONVERSATIONS QUITE ABILITY PART AND US RELATIONS ON IS A VERY LEVELS. I UNDERSTAND THEY ARE WORKING ON IT -- BUT AGAIN THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING ON SINCE TWENTY ELEVEN AND NOTHING HAS HAPPENED. MEANWHILE THE THE EXPOSURE LEVELS CONTINUE TO RISE IN MANY CASES THESE FOLKS END UP WITH NO EMPLOYMENT DUE TO THE FACT. THAT THEY GET TO THE TO THE LEVELS THAT THEY NO LONGER MEDICALLY COULD CONTINUE WORKING. THE A TICKET COUPLE SECONDS HERE COLLEGES AND WORKING VERY CLOSELY IN REVISING THE PL. BUT AS JONES THE OR KNOWN AS A GENERAL INDUSTRY LED STANDARD AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY LED STANDARD FOR THE PROTECTION OF WORKERS WERE EXPOSED TO LEAD ON THE JOB. I AM I DEBT. IN ADDITION TO THE FIRES IN CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN ABOUT A MASSIVE EFFORT TO BE ABLE TO REMOVE ALL LEAD IN PAINT. IN AS BEST AS AN INSTALLATION ETCETERA ETCETERA AND MANY OF OUR OLDER BUILDINGS THROUGHOUT THE STATE WHICH ALSO OF COURSE INCREASES NUMBER WORKERS EXPOSED. TO THESE LEVELS. THE CRYSTAL REQUIRES THAT EVERY EMPLOYER SHALL ENSURE THAT NO EMPLOYEES EXPOSED TO LEAD A CONCENTRATIONS GREATER THAN FIFTY MICROGRAMS PER CUBIC METER OF AIR AVERAGED OVER AN EIGHT HOUR PERIOD. I MIGHT ADD THAT IN MOST CASES THESE ARE MORE THAN EIGHT HOURS SHIPS. DUE TO THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE TO DO IT IN MANY CASES WERE EXPOSED TO THE PUBLIC. THE STAIRS BASED ON MEDICAL AND SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION IS MORE THAN THIRTY FIVE YEARS OLD OVER THIS TIME MUCH HAS BEEN LEARNED ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF LEAD AMONG ADULTS AT LOWER EXPOSURE LEVELS. ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH CURRENT SIZE FOR THE ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH. PERSPECTIVES IN A NATIONAL TECHNOLOGY PROGRAM AND THE US EPA STRONGLY INDICATES THE WORK OF LEVELS. THAT LOCAL BLOOD LEAD LEVELS SHOULD NOT EXCEED TWO FIVE TO TEN MICROGRAMS PER CUBIC METER OVER A WORKING LIFETIME NEVER MIND EIGHT HOUR DAY. YET EXISTING STANDARDS Là WORKERS TO HAVE BLOOD. LEAD LEVELS UP TO FIFTY TO SIXTY MICROGRAMS. PER CUBIC METER BEFORE THEY HAVE TO BE REMOVED FROM SIGNIFICANT LEAD EXPOSURE. THE P. L. X. IS IT PROPOSED TO BE UPDATED TO REFLECT CURRENT MEDICAL SCIENCE AND ESTABLISH A MORE PROTECTIVE STANDARD FOR LET CONSTRUCTION PROFESSIONALS. BUT IT HAS BEEN EIGHT YEARS SINCE THE ROOM MAKING WAS OPEN AND THE REVISIONS HAVE BEEN MADE. DISTILLATES HARMING WORKERS INCLUDING MY OWN MEMBERS. ESPECIALLY WITH THE INCREASED EXPOSURE MY MEMBERS ARE. FACING A PERFORMING ALL THE WILDLIFE. WELL FAR CLEANUP WORK PROCESS STATE THERE'S NO REASON THEY SHOULD BE OPERATING ON THE STANDARDS BASED ON A THIRTY FIVE REAL SCIENCE. I JUST I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT SOMEHOW WE COULD POSSIBLY DO THIS COMMITTEE EXPEDITE -- CAL OSHA TO ACT ON THIS IMMEDIATELY WHILE THEY'RE SAYING THAT TWENTY TWENTY OR MID TWENTY TWENTY WOULD BE IT WHEN THEY COME UP WITH THAT. I THINK THAT THIS COMMITTEE CAN BE VERY HELPFUL IN EXPEDITING THIS FOR THE SAKE OF ALL THESE WORKERS. SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR APPROVAL. YOU'RE VERY MINUTE -- BUT COMMON ARE I WOULD ONLY ADD IN THE DEPARTMENT CONCUR THAT THAT WE NEED TO MOVE ON THIS AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN I CAN'T. SPEAK. TO OF THE TIME SPAN THAT THAT. STARTED IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN AND TOOK A SQUARED WE ARE TODAY -- WHAT I CAN SAY IS THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS WORK COLLABORATIVELY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE HAVE INCORPORATED ALL DRAFT FEEDBACK? OF THE DEPARTMENT HAS MOVED TO THE REGULATORY PACKAGE TO OTHER LABOR IN THE WORKFORCE AGENCY FOR APPROVAL -- IT WILL THEN GO BACK TO A FORMAL SUBMISSION TO FINANCE AND THEN -- TO OF THE OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW. THE DEPARTMENT HAS DONE WHAT IT CAN THE IN THIS PROCESS THERE IS AN APPROVAL PROCESS FOR REGULATION FOR REGULATION'S BUT THAT THE DEPARTMENT CANNOT LEGALLY CIRCUMVENT. SOUL -- WE ARE WE'RE GRATEFUL THAT IT HAS TAKEN US THIS LONG TO GT HERE -- BUT WE ARE WORKING EXPEDITIOUSLY. IN THE PROCESS WHICH WOULD WHICH WE LIST IT HERE AT THIS TIME SO WHY IS IT TAKING SO LONG. WHAT I MEAN? SERIOUSLY THIS IS THIS JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE AND AND I I I RESPECT WOULD YOU SAY THAT YOU'VE BEEN WORKING COLLABORATIVE IN ALL THIS UT THAT'S NOT WORKING. AND AND A WHAT IS IT GOING TO TAKE. AND YOU KNOW THERE ARE I KNOW THE OTHER DEPARTMENTS. WOULD THEY WILL HAVE A BACKLOG OR SOMETHING IS GOING ON THAT'S TAKING LONGER FAST FOR MORE STAFF DOES WERE RESOURCES WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR MONTHS NOW. TAKING UP REQUEST. FOR MORE STAFFING MORE RESOURCES WHAT IS IT GONNA TAKE. AND HERE I HONESTLY I CANNOT DEFEND THE TIME THAT THEY TOOK FROM. 200-011-22000 AND SIXTEEN WE COULD TO MOVE TO TO BEGIN TO TAKE ACTION ON THESE REGULATIONS I KNOW ALL THAT. EXHAUSTIVE MEETINGS WERE HER OR HELD BUT FRANKLY I JUST I'M I'M BEING AS HONEST IN THIS TRANSPARENT AND CANDID AS I CAN. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED I DON'T KNOW WHAT CAUSED. THE DELAY ALL I CAN SPEAK TO GOING FORWARD IS WHAT WE ARE DOING NOW AND PROVIDE THE DEPARTMENT'S ASSURANCE THAT WE ARE WORKING AS EXPEDITIOUSLY. AS WE CAN. YES AND JUST WANTED TO ADD THAT -- THIS REGULATION I HAS AN FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS WHICH TRIGGERS THE THE THE STANDARDIZED REGULATION IMPACT ANALYSIS THE SHARIA AND SO THAT CERTAIN THE REQUIRES A YOU KNOW DISCUSSIONS WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND AND SO -- YOU KNOW WE'VE RECEIVED A DROP OF THE YEAR OF THE I. R. SRI -- WE'VE EEN WORKING WITH THEM SINCE WE'VE MOVED OUT MANY OF THE CONCERNS AND I THINK AT THIS POINT. ADD THE REGULATION SHOULD BE READY BY MID -- TWENTY TWENTY AS AND WE HAVEN'T RECEIVED THE UPDATED DROPS WITH ALL OF OUR WOULD BE UPDATED TRAPS BUT WE'RE YOU KNOW WE'RE LOOKING FOR TO RECEIVING A AND AND MOVING THIS REGULATION ALONG AND AND YES. SO WHY WOULD DO IT WOULD HAVE TO TAKE ANOTHER YEAR PLUS IF THE IT IF I MAY SPEAK TO THAT QUESTION -- THE THE APPROVAL PROCESS UNDER THE ADMINISTRATIVE -- OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW MAY TAKE UP TO A YEAR THIS IS A MAJOR REGULATION. IT IS POSSIBLE WHEN I CAN'T PROMISE ANYTHING BECAUSE WHEN I AM CONTROL THAT PROCESS BUT IF THE DEPARTMENT HAS DONE ITS WORK WELL IF THOSE MEETINGS. STAKEHOLDERS MEETINGS THAT TOOK PLACE RECEIVED A THAT INPUT FROM THE COMMUNITY IF THIS PACKAGE IS REFLECTIVE IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THE PACKAGE COULD MOVE MUCH MORE QUICKLY THAN THAT. I CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT I CAN'T PROVIDING ASSURANCE OF THAT THE ONE THING I CAN SAY IS THAT THIS PACKAGE GOALS BEYOND JUST THE PALE LIMIT. TO ALSO THE ACTION LEVEL WHICH IS ANOTHER LAYER OF PROTECTION SO IT REVISES. OF THE PILL LIMITS AS THE GENTLEMAN HAS COMENTED ON BUT IT GOES BEYOND -- THOSE SPELL LIMITS IT IS A STRONGER PROTECTION THAN CHEST REVISING THE PALE LIMITS A LOT. AND SO I'M NOT A SCIENTIST I CAN'T SPEAK TO THEM ANYMORE THAN I ALREADY HAVE -- BUT WE'RE WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT THE PROCESS WILL NOT TAKE A YEAR BUT TO MR HIM IN THIS IS POINT. IT IS NOT UNUSUAL IF IF WE ARE REQUIRED. COULD GOAL THROUGH THE OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW. TWO IN ACTED THIS REGULATION. IT'S NOT UNCOMMON THAT THE PROCESS TAKES A YEAR. THE SERVER MAY. YOU KNOW THE FACT THE MATTER IS IF THERE IS A HECK UP IN THE PROCESS. IF IN FACT THE DEPARTMENT HAS FOUND THAT THERE'S THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH CERTAIN STEPS TO ACQUIRE AND GET THE REGULATION IN PLACE IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT AT SOME POINT. SOMEBODY WOULD COME UP IN FLAG THAT UP AND SAID YOU KNOW WE'RE TRYING TO GET THIS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE BUT WE'RE HAVING TO DO WITH THIS OR THE OTHER. AND THERE HASN'T BEEN ANYTHING ON THAT IS THE ONLY REASON I'M HERE BEFORE YOU. BECAUSE IF IT'S IF IT'S A MATTER OF THE TYPICAL GOVERNMENT SLOW DOWN AS WITH HER FOR THE PRIOR PRESENTATION. THEN. YOU KNOW AT LEAST SOMEBODY GO AND START. FLAGGING IT TO YOU ON THE LEGISLATURE TO BE ABLE TO EXPEDITE THE PROCESS. AND THESE PEOPLE IN MANY CASES. RELEASE MY EMPLOYERS WE MONITOR THEM WE MAKE SURE THAT THEIR EMPLOYERS ARE ARE MONITORING THE EXPOSURE LEVELS. WHAT ABOUT ALL THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN NO REPRESENTATION THAT HAD DO NOT HAVE AN OVERSIGHT FROM A THIRD PARTY FOR EXAMPLE WHAT ABSOLUTE? BECAUSE THIS IS A VERY DIRTY TYPE ACTIVITY IT'S A LOWEST PAID IN THE INDUSTRY. AND IN THE CONSTRUCTION THIS RESULT WAS PAID. YET THE MOST HAZARDOUS. SO I WOULD BE OF THE DEPARTMENT THAT WHAT THEY COULD MAKES COMMITTEES IS GONNA TAKE ONE MORE YEAR TO THE MINISTRY OF LAW. I WOULD HOPE THAT BY THE GET TIME TO GET TO THAT POINT TO THIRTY THERE'S WITH IT IT TAKES IN A YEAR AND NOT ANOTHER FIVE YEARS. MR HELLO ANY COMMENTS. WELL. YOU KNOW I THINK THE MOST DISAPPOINTING PART OF THE FIRST IS THE NUMBER OF YEARS IT'S TAKEN. BUT THERE'S NO PLAN. REALLY TO EXPEDITE THIS. IF I MAY THERE'S NEVER THERE AND LISTEN UNDERSTAND BUT AND NO I I DON'T THINK YOU'RE MISUNDERSTANDING NECESSARILY I JUST WONDER [inaudible] GENTLY CORRECT WHAT AGES. THE DEPARTMENT HAS NO CAPACITY. TO ACCELERATE THIS PROCESS FROM THIS POINT BECAUSE THE DEPARTMENT DOESN'T OWN THE PROCESS -- OF THIS HAS TO GO THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IT HAS TO GO TO THE STANDARDS BOARD WHICH IS A SEPARATE ENTITY THAT HAS JURISDICTION OVER THIS MATTER IT HAS TO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS AND WE DON'T HAVE THE POWER. TO SET THAT PROCESS ASIDE. I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT YOU SET THE PROCESS ASIDE I'M SUGGESTING THAT YOU HAD THE STAFFING YOU COULD MOVE THE PROCESS FORWARD I ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH THAT SO IF IS STAFF IN AN ISSUE I FINISHED LAUGHING WAS AN ISSUE. I CAN'T SENATE STAFFING IS AN ISSUE TODAY. BECAUSE WE'RE WORKING ON IT. BUT IT IS POSSIBLE THAT. THE SLOWDOWN OR OF THE INACTION WAS IMPACTED BY MANY THINGS I DON'T HAVE PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE OF THAT -- BUT OBVIOUSLY WE DID NOT MOVE ON THIS REGULATION AS QUICKLY AS WE COULD I DON'T WANT TO MAKE ANY EXCUSES AT ALL IT'S CLEAR THE DEPARTMENT DOES NOT DISPUTE IN ANY WAY. THAT IT SHOULD HAVE MOVED FASTER. VISUAL SENATOR RESO AND DANIEL BRAND WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCEI JUST WANT TO ADD THAT YOU KNOW AS WE IDENTIFIED THERE ISN'T THE OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW PROCESS -- WHICH WE ARE IN NOW SO I DON'T BELIEVE THAT STAFFING IS AN ISSUE IT D. I. R. IT'S GOING THROUGH THIS PROCESS GETTING IT PASSED FINANCE REVIEW -- WE ARE LOOKING INTO THE IMPACTS AND AT A FIFTY DOLLAR A FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR MY APOLOGIES. AND MINIMUM IMPACT TO BE A MAJOR REGULATION THERE IS A LOT GOING ON HERE -- AND SO WE'VE HAD A LOT OF BACK AND FORTH WITH THE DEPARTMENT I DON'T THINK STAFFING IS AN ISSUE AT THIS TIME AS WE ARE JUST NOW. ENTERING INTO THIS HE SAID WE RECEIVE THIS FREE AND ARE ENTERING IN THE LA L. PROCESS THEM WITH THAT GOES INTO A PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD AND JUST THE REQUIRED TIME FRAMES FOR THOSE PROCESSES AND THANK YOU. THIS IS THE SECOND IN TERMS OF TWO GROUPS THE WORKERS HERE NOT A HAPPY MOMENT FOR ME NO I KNOW IT'S NOT FOR YOU AND IT'S NOT IT'S WORSE. FOR THEM. YOU KNOW YOU HAVE YOUR HEALTH.
