HEARING OF THE OUR PRIVACY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION COMMITTEE. OF APRIL THE THIRTIETH. TWENTY NINETEEN FIRST OF ALL LET ME. HELLO THANK GOD MY COMMITTEE SOUTH FOR THEIR WORK I UNDERSTAND THAT FOR THE PAST THREE FOUR WEEKS THEY'VE BEEN AVERAGING ABOUT THE HUNDRED HOURS. PER WEEK OR PER -- FOOTBALL WEEK PER PERSON SO I WANT TO THANK HIM FOR THEIR WORK AND FOR DOING THE ANALYSIS AND ALSO -- MAKING SUGGESTIONS TO A MAKING THE BILL'S BETTER SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WELL TODAY WE HAVE A TOTAL OF FIFTEEN ITEMS ON THE AGENDA. OF FIVE FOUR OF WHICH ARE ON PROPOSED CONSENT. AND UP. AB ELEVEN THROUGH A SIXTY THREE BY A MAN HAS BEEN PULLED FROM THE AGENDA SO. THAT'S ITEM NUMBER FOUR SO WITH THAT LET'S GO TO OUR OUR FIRST BILL AND THAT'S MISTER COOLEY -- ITEM -- NUMBER SIX A. B. FOURTEEN SIXTEEN AND WE CAN OPERATE AS A SUB COMMITTEE THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WELCOME MR COOLEY. VERY GOOD THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. AS I OPEN ON AB. FOURTEEN SIXTEEN I JUST WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND MISS SMITH AS YOU ARRIVE. OUR WHERE IN MY JOINT RULES HAD I HAVE MEETINGS I'M CONVENE WITH. ALL THREE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT. IN A FEW MINUTES ACROSS THE STREET SO I'M GONNA BE BRIEFED ON MY BILL AND THEN I'LL NEED TO LEAVE. AND IT'S A TWO TO FIVE O'CLOCK MEANS I'M BASICALLY TIED AFTER MADE THE DAY. OF SO -- I DO WANT. TO SAY SO I'M I'M HERE TODAY 2% AB FOURTEEN SIXTEEN RELAYED THE GOVERNMENT ACCESS OF COLLECTED PERSONAL DATA. AND I DO WANT TO THANK YOUR COMMITTEE STAFFS FOR THEIR ASSISTANCE ON THIS BILL. I WILL BE ACCEPTING THIS IS JUST AMENDMENTS. AS WELL AS AND IN A FOUR YEAR SUNSET TO THE BILL. AND I THINK THIS IS A GOOD MOMENT TO EXPLAIN SORT OF MY VIEW IS THIS BILL I'M ACTUALLY VERY PLEASED TO BE BRINGING THIS BILL. TO YOU TODAY. I THINK THE BILL PLAYS A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE IN OUR TRANSITION TO A NEW PRIVACY STANDARD. AND MY TAKE ON THE SUBJECT MATTER THIS BILL COURSE I VIEW THIS TO THE LENS OF BEING A LAWYER. AND SO MUCH OF MY CAREER HAS INVOLVED DEALING WITH STATUTORY MATTERS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. GOING ON NOW MORE THAN FORTY YEARS. SO OFTEN TIMES I HEAR THESE GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS I REMEMBER THEM BEING ADOPTED. MY BASIC VIEW OF WHAT WE HAVE DONE AND PRIVACY IN CALIFORNIA. IS A TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE AMERICAN APPROACH TO PRIVACY AND FOR THIS I AM INDEBTED TO MY DAUGHTER IN LAW WHO'S A SUBJECT MATTER EXPERT ON THIS. WHO'S IN THE ROOM. CATHERINE COOLEY -- TRADITIONALLY THE AMERICAN APPROACH TO PRIVACY HAS BEEN SECTOR BY SECTOR. WE'VE GONE INTO A SECTOR UNWRITTEN RULES FOR THE RULES OF PRIVACY IN THAT SECTOR. NOW WITH THE ADOPTION OF THAT ARE CALIFORNIA PRIVACY ACT WE HAVE DOCTOR MORE FOR EUROPEAN STANDARD. A MORE GLOBAL APPROACH TO PRIVACY. THIS REPRESENTS A GREAT FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE IN HOW WE APPROACH PRIVACY. FROM A SECTOR BY SECTOR TAYLOR RULES BY NICHE ECONOMY SECTORS TOO MUCH MORE GLOBAL STANDARD. MY CONCERN. IS A WE HAVE A GREAT MANY PROGRAMS AT THE STATE LEVEL THE LOCAL LEVEL CITIES AND COUNTIES. OR UNITS A GOVERNOR TASKED WITH TRACKING DEAD BEAT DADS IN. AND WATCHING HOW MEDICAL CARE GETS DELIVERED AND MAINTAINING AFFORDABILITY HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. A WIDE ARRAY OF AREAS WHERE WE RUN GOVERNOR PROGRAMS WE SHOULD BE AFFECTED RELY UPON DATA AND THE ACCESS TO DATA. AND I HAVE A DEEP CONCERN THAT AS WE MAKE THE JUMP WHICH IS THE TRAINS LIKE TO STATION DO. THE MOVE THE MORE GLOBAL STANDARD. THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF LEGACY PROGRAMS ON THE BOOKS AND I AM CONCERNED FOR HOW WE HARMONIZE. THE ESTABLISHED PROGRAMS WITH THE NEW STANDARD. AND THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL. IS ABOUT FORCING NOW HARMONIZATION. I'VE I AM THANKFUL TO COMMITTEE SUBS OF AMENDMENTS I THINK THEY ARE COMPATIBLE THAT OBJECT. BUT HONESTLY THE ADDITION OF A SUNSET. IS TO MAKE CLEAR THAT EVEN AT THIS BILL SIGNED AND BY THE GOVERNOR AS I WOULD EXPECT IT WOULD BE. THAT ALL INTERESTED PARTIES DUE TO STAY ON THIS PROBLEM OF HARMONIZATION. SO WHY THEY IT ADEQUATELY HARMONIZED BY THE MEMBERS TODAY OR IF NOT WE HAVE FOUR YEARS TO WORK OUT THOSE DETAILS. BECAUSE FAILING THAT. THE SUNSET WILL OPERATE IT WOULD JUST GO BACK TO THE PRIVACY BILLS AND NOT ADOPTED LAST YEAR. SO IT'S SORT OF PUTTING EVERYONE ON THE GUN TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SYSTEMS ARE WORKING. AS WE HARMONIZE THE PRIOR WORK OF LEGISLATURE'S SPECIFIC DOUBLE PROGRAMS WITH THE NEW PRIVACY STANDARDS. SO THIS IS NOT A CASE EVEN HAVE. TAKEN THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS SO THEY WILL BE IN PLACE FOREVER. THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS WILL ONLY DEVIATE FROM LAST YEAR PRIVACY ACT. OF FORT BILLS FOR YEARS UNLESS WE EXTEND THAT SUNSET OR OR MODIFY THE RULES OR SOME WAY. AND I ACTUALLY SEE THAT AS WAY TO DRIVE IN NEED OF HARMONIZATION OF OUR STATUTES. SO WHAT THAT IS BACKDROP ON IN JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY WHEN THE CALIFORNIA CIVIL PROTECTION ACT. OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN GOES THE FACT. CONSUMERS GAIN THIS ABILITY TO OPT OUT. VERY IMPORTANT STANDARD MUCH IN KEEPING WITH THE EUROPEAN STANDARD. GAIN THE ABILITY TO OPT OUT OF BUSINESSES SHARING THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION INCLUDING THE GOVERNMENT ALL AGES WHICH USE THE DATA TO PERFORM ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS. PHILOSOPHE DOWN STANDARD DOES HAVE THE POTENTIAL IMPACT ALL MANNER OF GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS. THIS BILL PERMITS BUSINESS TO COMPLY WITH THE CCPA WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES WITHIN FOR MASON ESSENTIAL TO PREVENTING FRAUD AND OTHER ILLEGAL ACTIVITY. ADDITION THIS BILL ALLOWS GOVERNOR AGE TO TRAXXAS PERSONAL DATA CONTINUE OPERATING MANDATED PROGRAMS. IN THIS WAY MY BILL A. B. FOURTEEN SIXTEEN WILL HARMONIZE. LOOKS TO HARMONIZE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SEAT CPA WITH EXISTING STATUTORY OBLIGATIONS OF VARIOUS UNITS OF CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT. IS SUCH AREAS AS LOCATING PARENTS WHO ARE DELINQUENT ON CHILD SUPPORT. FOR THE PURPOSE OF ENFORCING CHILD SUPPORT OBLIGATIONS. LOCATED IN FAMILY MEMBERS FOR CHILDREN THE ENTER THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. OUR LAW WHICH I CHAIR THE SLICKER FOSTER CARE FAVORS UNIFICATION. AND SERVING KIDS IN RELATIONSHIP WITH BLOOD RELATIVES. AND THAT'S COULD BE A CONTROVERSY TIME EXCUSE AFFECTED BY DAUGHTER IN LAW WHO'S IN THE ROOM -- BECAUSE WE HAVE FOSTER GRAND KIDS I HAVE FOSTERING KIDS. BUT THIS ABILITY TO TRACK DOWN FAMILY MEMBERS IS INTEGRAL TO OUR FOSTER CARE SYSTEM IN THIS BILL WILL SUPPORT THAT TRANSITION TO THE NEW. PRIVACY STANDARD ALSO DATA NEEDED BY HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS OR PROVIDER NETWORKS TO CONTROL COSTS. IN THE MEDICAL OR MEDI CAL PROGRAM BY IDENTIFYING POTENTIAL FRAUD. SO THAT'S THE BACKDROP TO THIS BILL. I SEE IT IS COURSE IN HARMONIZATION MAKING SURE OUR GIVE A FOUR YEAR WINDOW. TO THROUGHOUT OUR STATUTES TO HARMONIZE THE NEW PRIVACY STAND WITH GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS. THE WORK HAS TO BE DONE BECAUSE IT FOUR YEARS OUT. IF YOU HAVEN'T KEPT THE STANDARDS IN PLACE BY THIS BILL BIKES IN THE SUNSET. PARTICULAR PROGRAMS WE SENT THE RIVER TO THE SEA CPA. SO. THERE'S NOTHING THIS BILL THAT REPRESENTS A DEPARTURE FROM THE C. CPA. EXCEPT THE LEGISLATURE'S APPROVAL FOR YEARS HENCE. IT CREATES A WINDOW FOR HARMONIZATION BUT THEN. THE SUNSET WILL KICK IN. SO HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL I'M A STORAGE JEFF NEAL THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES I'M GONNA REFER TO MY CLOCK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- FIRST ONE IS PLEASE. MY NAME IS THAT JEFF NEAL I REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES I'M PROUD TO BE HERE TODAY TO SUPPORT AB -- ONE FOUR ONE SIX I'M PERSONALLY LOOKING FORWARD -- TO THE LAW GOING INTO EFFECT IN JANUARY PLAN TO CONTACT SOME COMPANIES AND ASK THEM TO DELETE OR STOP SELLING MY DATA -- BUT I'M NOT LOOKING FORWARD -- TO THE WORD GETTING OUT AMONG THE COMMUNITY OF OF THOSE WHO WHO WOULD RATHER NOT SUPPORT THEIR CHILDREN ABOUT THE STEPS THAT THEY CAN TAKE TO OPT OUT OF THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES. I'M NOT LOOKING FORWARD TO A TREASURE TAX COLLECTORS NOT HAVING ACCESS TO THE DATA THAT THEY RELY ON TO FIND. THOSE WHO -- AND AND COLLECT DEBTS FROM THOSE WHO TRY TO EVADE THEIR TAXES THIS BILL WOULD FIX THAT -- GOVERNMENT IS IT CONSIDERED A BUSINESS UNDER THE PRIVACY ACT -- COUNTIES CAN RETAIN AND USE AND IF IT'S PART OF A PUBLIC RECORD SHARE -- PERSONAL INFORMATION IN CASES WHERE A PRIVATE ENTITY WOULD NOT BE ABLE -- TO BUT BECAUSE ABOUT A QUIRK IN THE THE CZ PA A COUNTIES CANNOT ALWAYS RECEIVE INFORMATION. FROM PRIVATE ENTITIES AND THIS BILL WOULD FIX THAT. IS BUT WOULD ALSO MAKE IT EASIER -- AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER COOLEY POINTED OUT FOR FOR ACCOUNT -- FOR COMPANIES TO DETECT TO PREVENT FRAUD AND MONEY LAUNDERING AND SIMILAR CRIMES BY ALLOWING THEM TO USE THE METHODS THAT THEY HAVE LEARNED WORK BEST TO DO THAT WHICH ARE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT FROM THE WAY TO ENVISIONED IN THE LAW CURRENTLY. AT SO WE REACHED OUT -- TO PRIVACY ADVOCATES -- SOMETIME AGO ASKING THEM TO HELP US WITH LANGUAGE THAT WOULD ACHIEVE THESE GOALS AND FIX THESE ISSUES WITHOUT ROLLING BACK THE PRIVACY ACT OR CREATING LOOPHOLES BECAUSE THAT'S NEVER BEEN OUR INTENTION -- AND THAT'S WHY I LIKE TO TO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THAT YOUR YOUR STAFF ON THE COMMITTEE BECAUSE THE AMENDMENTS THAT YOU'VE SUGGESTED AND AND THAT THE AUTHORS AGREED TO TAKE I THINK PROVIDE A PRODUCTIVE STEP FORWARD -- THAT DOES THAT DOES FIX THESE ISSUES BUT WITHOUT ROLLING BACK THE IMPORT ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF LAST YEAR SO I THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THE MATTER AND AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO HER TODAY. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE NEXT SO WHEN HIS PLACE. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. OF THE CAL CHAMBER TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT FROM THE BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE THOSE TASKED WITH IMPLEMENTING THIS COMPLEX LAW -- THIS BILL LIKE THE OTHERS WE SUPPORTED LAST WEEK SIX TO FIX A PROBLEM WITH THE CCPA LAST WEEK YOU HEARD THE DETAILS OF OTHER BILLS ARE PURSUING THIS YEAR CLARIFYING LOYALTY AND REWARDS PROGRAMS CAN CONTINUE ENSURING PEOPLE GET NOTIFICATIONS FOR SAFETY RECALLS FOR THEIR VEHICLES. ONE BILL LITERALLY JUST FIXED A SENTENCE THAT WAS UNCONSTITUTIONAL. AND ALL THESE BILLS WE'VE BEEN MORE THAN WILLING TO SIT DOWN AND FIGURE OUT THE NARROWEST LANGUAGE TO ACCOMPLISH THESE NECESSARY FIXES AND THE SAME IS TRUE HERE. THE BILLS AND BEEN IN PRINT FOR A LONG TIME AND WE JUST GOT FEEDBACK ON THE LANGUAGE OF LETTERS FILED WEDNESDAY EVENING. AND THE COMMITTEE'S CONCERNS AND WE HEARD THEM LOUD AND CLEAR -- AND WE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOUR STAFF FOR TAKING SO MUCH TIME TO WRITE SUCH A DETAILED ANALYSIS -- YOUR POINTS ARE OBVIOUSLY VERY WELL TAKEN AND THE AUTHOR IS ACCEPTING ALL OF THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS. THE LAW RIGHT NOW THE LIKE THE LANGUAGE THE BILL DOESN'T FIX ALL OF OUR CONCERNS BUT IT DOES ADDRESS ONE OF THE BIGGEST ONES AS CURRENTLY DRAFTED THE C. C. P.'S OPT OUT PROVISION WILL INADVERTENTLY ASSIST FRAUDSTERS IN BOTH STEALING CALIFORNIANS IDENTITIES AND MAKING FRAUDULENT PURCHASES IN THEIR NAMES. FURTHER IT WILL UNDERMINE BUSINESSES LEGAL COMPLIANCE ACTIVITIES AND EFFORTS TO PROTECT CONSUMERS FROM OTHER CRIMES LIKE MONEY LAUNDERING IN HUMAN TRAFFICKING. ALLOWING BAD ACTORS TO USE THE CCPA TO EFFECTIVELY OPT OUT OF FRAUD DETECTION SERVICES FOR EXAMPLE WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY HAMPER THESE EFFORTS AND IT WOULD HELP CRIMINALS. WHO ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY MORE SOPHISTICATED IN ORGANIZED IN THIS SPACE WITHOUT THESE CHANGES WE WILL A ROAD A SIGNIFICANT TOOL USED TO STOP THEM? THIS EASY PAY ALREADY RECOGNIZED AS PART OF THIS PROBLEM IN THE DELETION SECTION OF THE LAW WHICH HAS AN EXEMPTION STATING THAT A BUSINESS NEED NOT DELETE DATA THAT'S NECESSARY TO DETECT SECURITY INCIDENTS OR TO PROTECT AGAINST MALICIOUS DECEPTIVE FRAUDULENT OR ILLEGAL ACTIVITY. BASED ON THE NARROWING LANGUAGE THE AUTHORS ACCEPTING AB FOURTEEN SIXTEEN MERELY APPLIES THAT SAME TYPE OF EXEMPTION TO THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT. OF THE SALE DATA FOR THOSE LIMITED PURPOSES AND ADDS FURTHER IT LIMITS ON TOP OF THAT THE NECESSARY FIXING WE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE MEMBERS THANK YOU.

D'ANGELO TESLA IN SUPPORT THANK YOU MUCH NECKLACE. RAINY PA CONSUMER DATE INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU OPPOSITION PLEASE COME ON UP WELCOME THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS DON'T SERVERS ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIANS FOR CONSUMER PRIVACY WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE WORK IN DIALOGUE WE'VE HAD WITH ASSEMBLYMEMBER COOLEY AND HIS STAFF AND THIS AND THE SPONSORS OF THE BILL BUT HERE TODAY. WE'RE RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION TO THE MEASURE -- WHAT WE RECOGNIZE THAT SOME OF THESE AMENDMENTS NARROW SOME OF THE PROVISIONS WITHIN THE BILL OR THE PROPOSED BILL? WE DO HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS WITH HOW THIS PROPOSAL INTERACT WITH THE C. CPA WHEN IT COMES INTO EFFECT ON JANUARY. ONE TWENTY TWENTY AND WE THINK THE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT THE VERY QUESTION THAT THE COMMITTEE SHOULD CONSIDER -- WHERE IT SAYS THE FUNDAMENTAL POLICY QUESTION AS TO WHETHER AND WHEN GOVERNMENT ACCESS INTERESTS OUT WAY CONSUMERS PRIVACY INTERESTS? AS YOU ALL KNOW. CALIFORNIANS. RIGHT TO PRIVACY IS ENSHRINED IN ARTICLE ONE SECTION ONE OF THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION. WE BELIEVE THAT THE PROVISIONS IN THE C. C. PA THAT PROVIDE A CONSUMER THE ABILITY TO OPT OUT OF THE SALE OF THEIR DATA. OR REQUESTS FOR DATA A BUSINESS TO DELETE THEIR DATA ARE MECHANISMS FOR A CONSUMER TO REALIZE THAT CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT AND PRACTICES NOT BECAUSE THERE WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY. OR DO SOMETHING INAPPROPRIATE BE BECAUSE BECAUSE I WANT TO REALIZE THEIR RIGHT TO PRIVACY TO DATE. IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT GOVERNMENT. AGENCIES AND OTHERS HAVE BECOME TO RUN HAVE COME TO RELY ON LARGE DATABASES WHERE FOLKS PUT TOGETHER DATA ABOUT ALL KINDS OF CONSUMERS FOR THE PURPOSES OF POTENTIALLY NEEDING IT FOR THAT GOVERNMENT. PROGRAM IF A CONSUMERS EXERCISE THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT. SHOULD THEY STE SHOULD A GOVERNMENT AGENCY STILL BE ABLE TO COLLECT DATA ON THAT CONSUMER FOR POTENTIALLY NEEDING IT IN THE FUTURE. I THINK WE HAVE A SERIOUS WE THINK THAT PRESENTS A SERIOUS POLICY QUESTION THAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED HERE. JUST BECAUSE IT CAN IF CONSUMERS OPTED OUT TO THE SALE OF THEIR DATA WHETHER IT'S THEIR LOCATION DATA OR THEIR SEARCH HISTORY OR THE RETAIL PURCHASES. SHOULD THAT DAY TO STILL BE ABLE TO BE SOLD TO GOVERNMENT FOR A PURPOSE OF POTENTIALLY FINDING. A RELATIVE FOR ANOTHER MECHANISM I KNOW SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WERE MENTIONED HERE INCLUDED ISSUES SUCH AS CHILD SUPPORT AND OTHER. SITUATIONS WHERE SOMEONE MAY BE INVADING THEIR RESPONSIBILITY WE SELL IT CERTAINLY DON'T BELIEVE THE CCPA WAS. DEVELOPED OR IN PLACE TO PROTECT THAT TYPE OF BEHAVIOR BUT THERE ARE MECHANISMS THROUGH THE COURTS THE COURTS CAN APPLY FOR ORDERS TO PAY FOR CHILD SUPPORT AND THERE'S MECHANISMS. TO FIND PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT PAID CHILD SUPPORT OR NOT PAYING CHILD SUPPORT. SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE YOU KNOW WHAT ENCOURAGE A NO VOTE BECAUSE WE THINK THAT -- YOU KNOW THAT THE TENSION HERE BETWEEN A CONSUMERS PRIVACY RIGHT AND THE GOVERNMENT. NEED HERE IS IS A DIFFICULT ONE BUT WE THINK THAT THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO PRIVACY. YOU KNOW OUTWEIGHS THE NEED. FOR SIGNIFICANT DATA COLLECTION THAT DOESN'T YOU KNOW WITHOUT A SPECIFIC. NEED WHETHER IT'S A WARRANT FOR A SUBPOENA OR A REGULATORY INQUIRY AS OUT THAT'S OUTLINED ALREADY IN THE US CIVIL CODE SO FOR THOSE REASONS ANSWER NO THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. AT THE CORE AND ON BEHALF OF A COMMON SENSE KIDS ACTION ONE OF THE CO AUTHORS OF CCPA AS WELL AS THE ACLU THE EFF AND COMMON -- AND EXCUSE ME PRIVACY RIGHTS CLEARING HOUSE I WOULD LIKE TO FEEL A BIT AFFILIATE MYSELF WITH THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUES AND ALSO WOULD JUST GIVE A COUPLE EXAMPLES IF IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT A LOT OF THE INFORMATION THAT IS. USED TO AUTHENTICATE AN INDIVIDUAL AND IN TERMS OF MANY BOTH PRIVATE AND GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS IS OTHERWISE SEEMINGLY INNOCUOUS DATA A COUPLE YEARS AGO YOU MAY RECALL THE IRS BREACH -- IN WHICH A NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS HAVE THEIR THEIR IRS REFUNDS ESSENTIALLY STOLEN FROM THEM AND THE INFORMATION THAT WAS USED WAS ON ITS FACE PRETTY INNOCUOUS IT WAS DATA THAT WAS COLLECTED THROUGH A VARIETY OF DATA BREACHES THINGS LIKE WHAT WAS THE NAME OF YOUR FIRST DOG. WHERE DID YOU GO TO HIGH SCHOOL WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE COLOR YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS THAT ARE USED IN AND PURPOSES OF? SORT OF THESE THESE FRAUD PROTECTION PROGRAMS AND SO FEASIBLE LEE -- THE CRAFTING OF THIS WE RE NOT ONLY AS OVERLY BROAD BUT SOMETHING THAT COULD ACTUALLY EXPLICITLY -- IT GOT THE BOTTOM OUT OF CCPA AND OTHER VITAL PRIVACY PROTECTIONS IN CALIFORNIA SO WE STRONGLY OPPOSE THIS MEASURE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ADDITIONAL INDIVIDUALS IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL PLEASE COME FORWARD. MORE MONEY ON BEHALF OF CONSUMER REPORTS IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU VERY MUCH AN NEXT PLEASE. TO TURN MEMBERS KEVIN BIG OF AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OF CALIFORNIA ALSO IN OPPOSITION TO THE CONTINUED WEAKENING OF THE CPA THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SEEN NO OTHER OPPOSITION LET'S BRING BACK TO COMMITTEE QUESTIONS -- COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEES. OR STEP IF -- WHAT BEFORE WE GO TO QUESTIONS WHEN WE ESTABLISH QUORUM SO THAT WE COULD MOVE THE BILL OUT? TELL HERE. HIGHLY HERE BAUER-KAHAN. BERMAN. CALDERON GABRIEL [inaudible] GALLAGHER [inaudible] IRWIN [inaudible] OBERNOLTE. SMITH. WICKS. WE DO A QUORUM ON TO HAVE QUESTIONS. WHICH WERE GOING. I I APPRECIATE YOUR WORK ON THIS ISSUE HI. ALL THIS IS A PROBLEM -- ONE MAJOR AND PROGRAMS ARE EFFICIENT AND TALENT THAT. ESPECIALLY PROUD PREVENTION THAT WE'RE ABLE. TO DO THAT IN AN INTELLIGENT WAY WITH WHEN YOU SEE HOW MANY SCAMMERS SO THERE ARE SOME YOU KNOW LET'S PRINCES WITH THE THE CARD BEING BREACHED. I ALSO APPRECIATE THE THE CONCERNS OF THE PRIVACY GROUP SO. I I THINK. I'VE FOR ME IT'S TOO EARLY FOR THIS CONVERSATION TO END BECAUSE I I THINK THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT NEEDS TO BE SOLVED BUT I I DO THINK THAT -- THE BREADTH OF THE EXTENSION IS IS CONCERNING SO NO VOTE -- FOR SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY BUT I PLEASE KEEP WORKING WITH THESE GROUPS BECAUSE IT IS -- DEFINITELY -- WE DON'T WANT TO SEE SEE SEE PA UNDERMINED WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S WORKABLE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE PROTECT PRIVACY. BUT AND AND ALSO MAKE SURE THAT CONSUMERS STILL GET WHAT THEY NEED FROM CCPA SO -- LIKE I SAID JUST CONTINUE TO WORK ON WELL I APPRECIATE THAT OF THE SAME MEMBER OR ONE I WANT TO SAY. I DO NOT BELIEVE THIS IS A BILL THAT TAKES THE BOTTOM OUT OF THE SYSTEM. SOMETHING UNIQUE IS HAPPENING IN THIS HEARING GENERALLY A SUNSET IS IMPOSED ON AUTHORED OVER BILL ALONG. I ACTUALLY ASKED FOR THE SUNSET BECAUSE IN THIS CASE. THE SUNSET AS A WAY TO ENSURE THAT. THE CHANGES THAT I'VE TAKEN FROM STAFF. HAVE TO COME BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE TO STAY IN PLACE PASSED. TWENTY TWENTY FOUR IT FORCES THE CONVERSATION IT FORCES PEOPLE WORK OUT THE DETAILS. BUT IF NOTHING IS DONE WE ACTUALLY RIVER TO THE SEA CPA. SO I ACTUALLY FEEL I'M. COMMITTED THIS HARMONIZATION TO WORKING OUT THE DETAILS I THINK THAT'S THE VIEW OF OF PUBLIC SERVICE. TO CONNECT THE NEW LAWS THE EXISTING LAWS THAT SORT OF THAT OVERSIGHT IDEA THAT INTERESTS ME. AND MY REQUEST TO IMPOSE A SUNSET ON MY OWN BILL IS ACTUALLY. TO TRUTH THE CONVERSATION AND WHAT WE PASSED LAST YEAR TO MAKE SURE THAT THE DETAILS GET WORKED OUT FOR HOW WE WORKED EXISTING PROGRAMS AND NOT LET THE CONVERSATION JUST GO AWAY AND FORGET ABOUT. IT FORCES IT BACK INTO THE HOLES THE LEGISLATURE WHICH I THINK IS WHERE. THIS TYPE OF PUBLIC POLICY WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE SO I WILL CERTAINLY TEND TO IT IS A BILL MOVES FOR I THINK YOU FOR THAT. I AM MINDFUL THIS IS THE FIRST. KEY HEARING ON THIS BILL AND I WILL PURSUE A DILIGENCE BUT I I WANT TO SAY TO MY COLLEAGUES. ADDITIONAL SUNSET CLAUSE IS MY FURTHER PLEDGE TO STAY ON THE SYSTEM IN THE CONVERSATION. AND MAKE SURE THAT THIS HARM RELATIONS AND INDEED DONE AND THAT WE IN THE LEGISLATURE. ARE THE ONES TO GOVERN THAT -- SO I FEEL THIS IS SORT OF A CASE OF FIRST IMPRESSION FOR THE AUTHOR TO VOLUNTEER SUNSET TO SEND IT BACK TO THE STATUS QUO ANTE -- BUT I FEEL THIS IS A SET OF FACTS WERE ACTUALLY MAKES SENSE IT'LL FORCE A CONVERSATION. WITH THAT I I WILL OFFER THAT AS MY CLOTHES I REGRET I'M SUPPOSED TO BE RUN IN THE MEDIAN AND FEW MINUTES SO I NEED. TO HAVE SO IT'S SO ARE THERE ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS BEGINNING AT THE BOTTOM OF PAGE NINE AT AUTHORS AMENDMENTS. I'D LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH MY OFFICE ON THE BILL -- I WANT TO SAY THAT YOU GUYS REALLY MADE THE BILL BETTER SO THANK YOU -- AB ELEVEN TWELVE ESTABLISHES A BASIC LEVEL OF STATEWIDE STANDARDS FOR LOCAL REGULATION OF SHARED MOBILITY DEVICES. WHITE BIKES AND SCOOTERS TO ENSURE CLARITY Là TWENTY FOUR ZERO MISSION TRANSPORTATION REDUCE TRAFFIC CONGESTION AND INCREASE SAFETY ON THE ROAD. IN THE U. S. 35% OF ALL TRIPS OR TWO MILES OR LESS LESS IN LENGTH AND ONE SOLUTION TO GET CARS OFF THE ROAD AND REDUCE EMISSIONS -- DEAL WITH TRAFFIC CONGESTION -- AND TO GET PEOPLE OUT IN THE STREETS -- IS -- TO UTILIZE SHARED MOBILITY DEVICES THESE ARE AFFORDABLE AND CONVENIENT FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO USE PUBLIC TRANSIT BUT WORRY ABOUT THE LAST COUPLE MILES TO WHEREVER THEY'RE GOING. THESE DEVICES ARE A LAST MILE LINK TO PUBLIC TRANSIT. A BUS STOPS TRAIN STATIONS -- WITHOUT HAVING THE NEED TO PARK A CAR. OR USE MORE EXPENSIVE SERVICE CURRENTLY THERE'S A PATCHWORK OF ORDINANCES ACROSS THE STATE THAT REGULATE MOBILITY DEVICES OR MANY CASES DON'T REGULATE THEM AND ALL OF CITIES. KIND OF IGNORE THEM -- AND WILL CREATE NUISANCES BY NOT HAVING COMMONSENSE REGULATIONS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. THIS MAKES IT COMPLICATED FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO ENFORCE ACROSS DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS THEY DON'T ALWAYS KNOW WHAT THE RULES ARE IN A JURISDICTION CERTAINLY WRITERS DON'T KNOW WHAT THE RULES ARE. THE COMPANIES THEMSELVES DON'T KNOW WHAT THE RULES ARE. SO THIS BILL PROVIDES A REASONABLE FRAMEWORK STATEWIDE WHILE ENCOURAGING LOCALITIES TO DO THE WORK THEY NEED TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH THEIR COMMUNITY WHERE DO WE WANT TO HAVE THIS SHARED VEHICLES WERE DON'T WE WILL HAVE IT WANT TO HAVE THEM. IT GIVES THEM THE ABILITY TO HAVE -- FEES THAT THEY CAN PUT ON THE MOBILITY DEVICES TO FOR REVENUE SOURCE TO PAY FOR THAT INFRASTRUCTURE. AND WE THINK THAT IT'S A YOU KNOW REALLY THE BEGINNING OF A FRAMEWORK OF STATEWIDE FOR THESE DEVICES WITH ME TODAY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AB ELEVEN TWELVE ARE. A KIND EL GODLY -- WITH BIRD SCOOTERS GOVERNMENT PARTNERSHIPS AND CORDY JENSEN WITH TECHNET I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHAU. FIRST ONE IS PLACE WELCOME THOSE ARE ALL OF OUR OTHER WITNESSES OUT THERE WE CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF AB ELEVEN TWELVE MY NAME IS KENDALL GAG LEO AND PART OF THE GOVERNMENT PARTNERSHIPS TEAM FOR BIRDS SKATERS. WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL AND BELIEVE IT IS PART OF THE STATE SOLUTION TO REACHING OUR ENVIRONMENTAL AND TRANSPORTATION GOALS. BIRD IS A LAST MILE ELECTRIC VEHICLE SHARING COMPANY DEDICATED TO BRINGING AFFORDABLE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY TRANSPORTATION SOLUTIONS TO COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE WORLD. OUR MISSION IS TO PARTNER WITH CITIES TO BUILD COMMUNITIES WITH FEWER CARS ON THE ROAD. A CITY WITH YOUR CARS GREATLY IMPROVES THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF ALL OF ITS RESIDENTS. BIRD RIDES A REPLACING CAR TRIPS THE AVERAGE PRIDE IS A MILE AND A HALF WITH NEARLY 50% OF CAR TRIPS BEING SHORT DISTANCES OF THREE MILES OR LESS WE'RE CURRENTLY TAKING TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CAR TRIPS OFF CALIFORNIA CITY STREETS EVERY DAY. AFTER ONE YEAR OF OPERATING MORE THAN FOURTEEN MILLION MILES HAVE BEEN WRITTEN ON BIRDS AROUND THE WORLD WHICH IS PREVENTED MORE THAN TWELVE MILLION POUNDS OF CARBON EMISSIONS FROM ENTERING THE AIR. SCOOTERS OFFER A MORE EFFICIENT WAY TO MOVE PEOPLE AROUND CITY STREETS. YOU CAN MOVE SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE PER HOUR IN A PROTECTED BY CLEAN WILL ONLY A THOUSAND VEHICLES PER HOUR AN AVERAGE CARLING. BIRD HAS A POSITIVE ECONOMIC IMPACT ON THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT FOR EVERY THOUSAND BIRDS AND A CITY BIRD CREATES AN ESTIMATED TWO POINT FIVE MILLION IN ANNUAL EARNINGS FOR CHARGERS AND THREE HUNDRED EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES. BIRD BELIEVES IN SAFETY IN ADDITION TO WORKING WITH LOCALITIES TO PROMOTE THE INSTALLATION OF PROTECTED BIKE LANES AND OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE BIRD IS GIVEN AWAY MORE THAN SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND HELMETS TO WRITERS ACROSS THE U. S.. IMPLEMENTED COMPREHENSIVE WRITER SAFETY CAMPAIGNS AND TUTORIALS AND CREATED A COMMUNITY MODE WHICH ENSURES EASY REPORTING OF MISPLACED OR MISS PARK SCOOTERS DIRECTLY TO BIRD. MOTORIZED SCOOTERS OFFER A TRUE BENEFIT TO CALIFORNIA AND FOR THESE REASONS WE STRONGLY SUPPORT AB ELEVEN TWELVE AND URGENT AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MUCH NEXT WHEN HIS PLACE MISTER TURN MEMBERS COURTNEY JENSEN BEHALF OF TECHNO AND ALSO IN SUPPORT ONE I THINK THE AUTHOR AND THIS COMMITTEE FOR THEIR HARD WORK ON THIS BILL. I'M MIKE FROM ABILITY AS A NEW AND QUICKLY A GROWING INDUSTRY AS YOU ALL HEARD LAST WEEK -- BUT THAT OFFERS AN INNOVATIVE SOLUTION TO LONG TERM TRANSPORTATION ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES AND THE FIRST MILE LAST MILE CHALLENGES THAT PEOPLE FACE DAILY. AND THE DATA GENERATED BY THE SHARED BIKES AND SCOOTERS AWFUL ARE VALUABLE INSIGHTS TO CITIES AND TRANSPORTATION PLANNERS AND OUR MEMBER COMPANIES WANT TO WORK ALONGSIDE LOCAL TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES. TO UTILIZE THIS DATA IN A WAY THAT ACHIEVES CLEAR POLICY GOALS SUCH AS INFORMING PLANNING AND INFRASTRUCTURE DECISIONS AND ENABLING MORE COMPREHENSIVE ENFORCEMENT BUT ALSO RESPECT THE PRIVACY OF INDIVIDUAL WRITERS. THE INDUSTRY IS COMMITTED TO BUILDING OUT THESE VALUABLE SHARED INSIGHTS THROUGH THE% PROVISION OF DATA TO CITIES AS THEIR REGULATORS AND PARTNERS HOWEVER WHILE IT IS APPROPRIATE FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO ACCESS TO MOBILITY ADD DATA AS THE REGULATORS OF THESE EMERGENT BUSINESSES. IT SHOULD NOT COME AT THE COST OF CONSUMER PRIVACY SHARING PRECISE GEOLOCATION DATA ASSOCIATED WITH WHERE WRITER BEGINS CONTINUES AND ENDS THEIR TRIP PRESENTS RISKS TO INDIVIDUAL PRIVACY AND SHOULD NOT BE A FAIR AND SHOULD BE EFFECTIVELY AGGREGATED AND DE IDENTIFIED. TO PROTECT THE INDIVIDUAL CONSUMER DATA BECAUSE OF THE POTENTIAL TO USE THIS DATA TO RE IDENTIFY AND TRACK INDIVIDUALS THE C. C. P. A DESIGNATED LOCATION DATA AS PERSONAL INFORMATION. WITH THE AUTHORS AMENDMENTS OFFERED IN THE ANALYSIS AB ELEVEN TWELVE ESTABLISHES CLEAR GUIDELINES CONSISTENT WITH WITH CALIFORNIA'S RECENTLY ENACTED PRIVATE CAL CONSUMER PRIVACY LAWS. THIS WILL ENSURE CONSISTENT IMPLEMENTATION OF DATA SHARING STANDARDS BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AS SHARED MOBILITY SYSTEMS EXPAND IN CALIFORNIA WHILE PRESERVING THE RIGHTS OF CITIES TO DRAW INSIGHTS AND ACHIEVE IMPORTANT POLICY OBJECTIVES. WE APPLAUD THE EFFORT OF THE AUTHOR AND THIS COMMITTEE TO EXPAND THE AVAILABILITY OF THESE MOBILITY OPTIONS AND SAT GUIDANCE FOR PROTECTION OF SENSITIVE CONSUMER DATA AND THIS NEW INDUSTRY THANK YOU.

YOU HAVE A ITEM NUMBER NINE AND THAT IS -- AB SIXTEEN NINETY NINE ANYTIME YOU'RE READY I THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS TODAY AT PRESENT AB SIXTEEN NINETY NINE WHICH WILL PROHIBIT A MOBILE INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER FROM IMPAIRING OR TO GRADING THE LAWFUL INTERNET TRAFFIC. OF ITS PUBLIC SAFETY CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS DURING A DECLARED TATE OF EMERGENCY ONE RESPONDING TO DECLARE A STATE OF EMERGENCY PUBLIC SAFETY PERSONNEL. MAY UTILIZE THE STATEWIDE MUTUAL AID SYSTEM TO REQUEST ASSISTANCE OF NEIGHBORING JURISDICTIONS. THE EFFECTIVE DEPLOYMENT OF THE SYSTEM REQUIRES A HIGH DEGREE OF COORDINATION BETWEEN DEPARTMENTS AND REAL TIME UPDATES VIA SPECIALIZED COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE SANTA CLARA COUNTY FIRE OFFICIALS COMBATING THE MINNESOTA COMPLEX FIRE EXPERIENCE DATA THROTTLING OF THEIR COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT AS NOTED BY CHIEF ANTHONY ABOUT IN OF SANTA CLARA COUNTY. THE THROTTLING HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THEIR ABILITY TO PROVIDE EMERGENCY SERVICES AND IMPEDED THEIR ABILITY TO PROVIDE CRISIS RESPONSE AND ESSENTIAL EMERGENCY SERVICES. IS RESPONSIBILITY OF THE STATE TO PROVIDE PUBLIC SAFETY PERSONNEL WITH FULLY FUNCTIONING EQUIPMENT AND WHILE STEPS HAVE BEEN TAKEN BY PROVIDERS TO NEGATE. A REPEAT SITUATION. AB SIXTEEN NINETY NINE WILL ENSURE THE DATA THROTTLING OF PUBLIC SAFETY COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT IS NEVER REPEATED HERE WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. IS CHIEF JEFF MASTON OF THE CALIFORNIA FIRE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION BIGGER MUCHA. OF COURSE WHEN IS PLEASE WELCOME MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR LISTENING TO US TODAY -- LET ME I'LL GIVE YOU A LITTLE STORY ABOUT WHAT REALLY HAPPENS IN THE FIELD WHEN WE HAVE INCIDENTS -- WE GENERALLY SYMBOL FIVE ENGINE COMPANIES AND A LEADER AND WE CALL THAT A STRIKE TEAM. AND WHEN WE GO INTO THESE NEIGHBORHOODS OFTENTIMES WE'VE NEVER WORKED WITH THESE PEOPLE ON THE ENGINES BEFORE. SO WOULD BE NOT UNCOMMON TO HAVE YOUR CELL PHONE AND YOU WOULD TO PLUG IN ALL THE DATA FOR ALL TWENTY MEMBERS OF THAT TEAM. AND IS A STRIKE TEAM LEADER YOU WOULD GO AND USS NEIGHBORHOOD AND DETERMINE WHETHER THE PRIORITIES IF I WERE TO COME TO THE FIRST TIME THEY SEE A PROPANE TANK. I'LL TAKE A PICTURE OF IT BECAUSE I KNOW THAT IF FIRE A SURROUNDS IT IT'LL EXPLODE I SHARE THAT WITH ALL MEMBERS. AND THEN I GO DOWN THE STREET NOW TO SAM AND PUT AN ENGINE COMPANY HERE AND I SEE POWER LINES ARE DOWN AGAIN A VERY STE -- DANGEROUS SITUATION I WOULD TAKE A PICTURE OF THAT AND SHARE THAT THROUGHOUT. AND IS I GO DOWN TO THE END OF THE COLD CHECK I UNDERSTAND IS BLOCKED AND IF WE HAVE ANY ESCAPE ROUTE WE CAN'T USE THAT SO I WOULD TAKE A PICTURE OF THAT. AND SHARE WITH ALL TWENTY MEMBERS SO WE HAVE BECOME SEMI A SOPHISTICATED AND ARE A WHILE LAND IN ALL RESPONSE AND THE CELL PHONE HAS BECOME THE BACKBONE OF WHAT WE DO WE HAVE MAPPING ON THERE. WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO TEXT MESSAGE ALL TWENTY MEMBERS SIMULTANEOUSLY -- AND ALSO A RADIO PROTOCOLS DO NOT ALLOW US TO REALLY GIBBER JABBER ON THE ON THE RADIOS WERE GOING INTO A AND AREA SO WHEN WE DON'T HAVE THOSE TOOLS AVAILABLE TO US. IT'S DANGEROUS FOR THE CITIZENS THAT WE SERVE ITS DANGERS FOR THE THE FIREFIGHTERS THAT ARE THERE AND IT'S REALLY I'M I'M PORTANT ISSUE THAT WE BRING DATA BACK AND FORTH WITH EACH OTHER SO WE REALLY HOPE THAT YOU WILL SUPPORT THIS BILL. WE'RE VERY THANKFUL FOR ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEVINE TO BRING THIS FORWARD AND WE WOULD LIKE TO RESOLVE THIS BECAUSE THIS WILL BEST SERVE.

YOU WANNA MAKE A POINT THAT -- AFTER THE HEARING WE HELD LAST YEAR ABOUT THE DATA THROTTLING THAT OCCURRED IN THE MINUTES IN A COMPLEX FIRE I HAD HEARD REPEATED STORIES FROM FIRST RESPONDERS OF DATA THROTTLING EXPERIENCES THAT THEY HAD HAD. THROUGHOUT THEIR SERVICE SO IT'S NOT. IT'S NOT A A ONE TIME INCIDENT THAT DID OCCUR AND I'M GRATEFUL THAT THIS COMMITTEE -- IS IS HOPEFULLY GOING TO PASS THIS BILL THROUGH TODAY SO THAT WE CAN RESOLVE THIS THANK YOU I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE.

WICKS I YOUR BILL IS AL CONGRATULATIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. THANK YOU. CASH HANDLING SYSTEM AREA THAT BRINGS US TO MISTER CUNNINGHAM IS BILL. AND THAT IS ITEM -- NUMBER FIVE A. B. THIRTEEN NINETY FIVE WELCOME MISTER CUNNINGHAM ANYTIME YOU'RE READY YOU MAY PROCEED THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. I'M HERE TODAY TO PRESENT AB THIRTEEN NINETY FIVE THE ANTI EAVESDROPPING ACT. I'D FIRST LIKE THIS THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING SO HARD WITH US ON THIS BILL I THINK WE'VE. GOT AN IMPROVED PRODUCT ALTHOUGH MAYBE NOT A FINAL WORK PRODUCT AND ALL EXPLAIN WHY IN A MINUTE -- THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THE INNOVATION TWENTY FIRST CENTURY IS TRANSFORMED OUR LIVES WE HAVE SEEN MANY NEW PRODUCTS THAT MAKE OUR LIVES EASIER AND MORE ENJOYABLE. SOME THESE PRODUCTS ARE SO CALLED SMART SPEAKERS. IN THE CUNNINGHAM HOUSEHOLD WE HAVE A BUNCH OF SMART SPEAKERS WE USE THEM TO GREAT EFFECT. WHEN I MAKING BREAKFAST FOR THE KIDS I LIKE TO PLAY CLASSIC ROCK MUSIC ON THE SPEAKER? THE PLAY RAN SOUNDS MIKE YOUNG BOYS ARE TRYING TO FALSELY PUTS IT TROUBLE DOING -- WE AS THE GIRLS GET UP AND THEY THEY CHECK THE WEATHER ON A SMART SPEAKER THEY THERE'S A A TREMENDOUS BENEFIT TO HAVING AN INTER INTER CONNECTED HOME SO. I WANT TO SAY FROM THE OUTSET I'M A PERSONAL USER THESE PRODUCTS AND I THINK THEY'RE THEY'RE WONDERFUL PRODUCTS HOWEVER -- WELL I I SHOULD LAST NOTE THAT WE'RE NOT ALONE IN USING THESE PRODUCTS IT WAS REPORTED THE AMAZON -- WITH THEIR ALEXA VERSION OF A SMART SPEAKERS SOLD OVER A HUNDRED MILLION UNITS ALREADY THIS TECHNOLOGY IS ONLY BEEN OUT FOR A COUPLE YEARS -- BUT WE HAVE SEEN IN MEDIA REPORTS A RECENTLY THAT THESE DEVICES ALSO HAVE THE CAPACITY TO RECORD OUR PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS IN THE HOME WITHOUT OUR CONSENT. AND THERE'S NOTHING MORE PERSONAL AND NOTHING MORE FUNDAMENTAL I WOULD SUBMIT TO YOU. WITH RESPECT TO PRIVACY THAN MAINTAINING THE INTEGRITY AND PRIVACY IN THE HOME. A THAT WAS A BIG DEAL IN THE IN THE BILL RIGHTS THE THIRD AMENDMENT FOURTH AMENDMENT. AND THEN AS THE CONSTITUTION WERE PREMISED ON MAINTAINING PRIVACY IN THE HOME AGAINST GOVERNMENT TROOPS. IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE A LONG HISTORY PROTECTING PRIVACY IT'S THE RIGHT IN OUR STATE CONSTITUTION MANY STATES DON'T HAVE THAT RIGHT. OUR PENAL CODE CRIMINALIZES EAVESDROPPING -- THE RECORDING OF A PRIVATE CONVERSATION WITHOUT CONSENT IS ACTUALLY A CRIME CALIFORNIA UNLIKE MANY OTHER STATES. HOW TO PROTECT PRIVACY IN THE HOME MAY BE? THIRTEEN NINETY FIVE WILL PROVIDE THE MANUFACTURE OF AN INTER CONNECTED DEVICE WITH THE VOICE RECOGNITION FEATURE. I YES MARCH SPEAKER CANNOT STORE RECORDINGS AND SELLING SHARE DATA AND RECORDINGS A PERSONAL CONVERSATIONS. WITH A THIRD PARTY AND LAST THE CONSUMER PROVIDES EXPRESS. WRITTEN CONSENT. IT'S AN OFTEN REQUIREMENT AS OPPOSED TO OPT OUT IF THE CONSUMERS FINE WITH IT -- THEN. NO PROBLEM THEY GIVE PERMISSION AND THE MANUFACTURER CAN USE THE DEVICE AND USE THE RECORDINGS AND DO WHATEVER THEY WANT WITH THEM TO ENHANCE THE USER EXPERIENCE -- BUT THE CONSUMER SHOULD HAVE THE CHOICE. THIS BILL SEEKS TO RESTORE TRUST IT SEEKS. TO ALLOW OUR CONSTITUENTS TO ENJOY THE MANY BENEFITS OF AN INTERCONNECTED HOME. I WILL SETTING A BASELINE OF PRIVACY THAT ALLOWS THE INDUSTRY TO FLOURISH. WITH ME HERE TODAY'S AT HOWARD WITH WORKING PARTNERSHIPS USA. TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU'RE WELCOME GOOD AFTERNOON MR MEMBERS AT HOWARD ON BEHALF OF WORKING PARTNERSHIPS USA WHICH IS A SILICON VALLEY BASED COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION. WHOSE AIM IS TO ENSURE THAT THE PROSPERITY OF THE DIGITAL ECONOMY IS BROADLY SHARED -- MISTER MEMBERS WE WERE PERSUADED TO SUPPORT THE BILL BASED ON THE AMENDMENTS AT THAT ARE REFLECTED IN THE ANALYSIS AND WE HOPE THAT YOU WILL AS WELL. FOR THREE REASONS THE FIRST IS HOPEFULLY WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT PERHAPS OTHER THAN PUTTING A CAMERA IN YOUR HOME THE ABILITY OF TECHNOLOGY TO EAVESDROP ON YOUR MOST INTIMATE AND PERSONAL CONVERSATIONS IN THE HOME. BETWEEN YOUR WIFE BETWEEN YOUR HUSBAND DEALING WITH YOUR CHILDREN IS PERHAPS THE MOST SERIOUS PRIVACY INVASIVE RISK IMAGINABLE. WE BELIEVE THAT TO SIMPLY BE TRUE. THE SECOND IS THAT THE CCPA. DOES NOT REALLY GRAPPLE WITH THE KIND OF PERSONAL INFORMATION REVEALED IN A RECORDED CONVERSATION IN SEVENTEEN NINETY EIGHT POINT -- ONE FOR THE DEFINITIONS OF PERSONAL. INFORMATION DEAL WITH THINGS LIKE IDENTIFIERS LIKE SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER AND THOSE SORTS OF THINGS OR INTERNET BROWSING HISTORY. IT'S MORE REALLY ABOUT WHO YOU ARE. AND WHAT YOU MIGHT DO. BUT NOT VERY CLEARLY IF AT ALL ABOUT WHAT YOU SAY. AND THE FACT THAT THE CCPA DID NOT REPEAL. THE TELEVISION EAVESDROPPING STATUTE THAT THE AMENDMENTS AMEND IN THE ANALYSIS. IS AT LEAST INFERENTIAL LEE. OF THE FACT THAT THERE IS A SPECIAL NEED HERE FOR PRIVACY AND THAT THE CZ P. A. DOES SOMETHING DIFFERENT. THAN WHAT IS PROPOSED BY THIS BILL PROPORTIONAL TO THE POTENTIAL PRIVACY INVASION. AND THE THIRD AND FINALLY I THINK THIS IS ONE OF THE INSTANCES. WHERE THE LANGUAGE OF THE BILL AS IT IS PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED ITSELF MAKES THE BEST CASE FOR VOTING FOR THE BILL ON PAGE SEVEN OF YOUR ANALYSIS THE AMENDMENTS -- THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS BEGINNING YOU WILL SEE. THAT ALL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF RECORDED CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR FAMILY IN YOUR HOME. IS REALLY TWO THINGS. THE FIRST IS THAT THE WARNING ABOUT THAT HAPPENS NOT AT SOME OTHER OCT IN PLACE BUT DURING THE INSTALLATION OF THE PRODUCT THAT'S THERE IN SUBDIVISION A THAT SEEMS PROPORTIONAL TO THE SERIOUSNESS. OF THE IDEA OF A RECORDED CONVERSATION IN YOUR HOME WHICH IS WHY WE DID IT FOR TELEVISIONS AND WHICH IS WHY DIDN'T DO WORD EVEN AFTER THE CCPA WAS AN ACTOR. THE SECOND IS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER SAID OR TALKING ABOUT CONSUMER CONSENTED IT IS WRITTEN AGAIN IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE RECORDING CONVERSATIONS THAT TAKE PLACE IN THE HOME. SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR DR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ADDITIONAL SUPPORTERS -- PLEASE COME FORWARD. SEEN AN OPPOSITION PLEASE COME FORWARD. WELCOME THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR ACCORDING JENSEN ALTEC MATT AND I IN OPPOSITION -- WE APPRECIATE THE DIRECTION OF THE BILL AND AND THE AMENDMENTS I'M IN THE ANALYSIS -- WE DID SEE THE AMENDMENTS ON FRIDAY SO ARE STILL DIGESTING -- AND STILL SORT OF LOOKING THROUGH THAT THE NEW DIRECTION THAT THIS BILL'S GOING AND SORT OF JUST ONE TO ADD COME UP HERE AND AND KIND OF TALK ABOUT HOW THESE DEVICES WORK AND WHAT THEY DON'T DO. AND DEVICES ARE NOT LISTENING IN -- AFTER THE FACT COMPANIES MAY REVIEW A SMALL NUMBER OF DE IDENTIFIED UTTERANCES RECORDED FROM A RANDOM SET OF CUSTOMERS IN ORDER TO AUDIT AND IMPROVE MACHINE LEARNING TOOLS. SO FOR EXAMPLE THIS INFORMATION HELPS TRAIN SPEECH RECOGNITION AND NATURAL LANGUAGE SYSTEMS SO A DEVICE CAN BETTER BETTER UNDERSTAND YOUR REQUEST ENSURE THE SERVICE WORKS FOR EVERYONE -- BY DESIGN VOICE DEVICES DETECT A SPECIFIC WORD TO WAKE UP LIKE A VERBAL ON BUTTON AND THE DEVICE DETECTS THE WAKE WORD OF THE HOT WORD AND WHATEVER IT'S CALLED BY IDENTIFYING ACOUSTIC PATTERNS. THAT MATCH THAT WORD NO AUDIO IS STORED OR SENT TO THE CLOUD UNLESS THE DEVICE FIRST DETECTS THE WAKE WORD OR IN SOME A BUTTON IS ACTUALLY PUSHED. AND IN RARE CASES A VOICE DEVICE WILL WAKE UP DUE TO A WORD AND BACKGROUND CONVERSATION AND COMPANIES CONTINUE TO IMPROVE WAKE WORD ACCURACY AND MINIMIZE FALSE RESPONSES IN PART BY REVEALING RECORDINGS. I ALSO WANT TO STATE THAT MANUFACTURERS OF THESE DEVICES ALREADY GIVE CONSUMERS CONTROL OVER THEIR RECORDINGS CONSUMERS CAN ALREADY ACCESS MANAGE AND DELETE RECORDINGS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CONSENT CONSUMERS ACCOUNT. SO IF FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU HAVE ONE OF THESE DEVICES IN YOUR HOME YOU CAN ACTUALLY GO ON TO YOUR ACCOUNT SEE WHAT WAS RECORDED. AT REVIEW IT AND DELETE IT IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO AND SO YOU ALREADY HAVE THAT OPTION AS A CONSUMER. AND TO THE CCPA POINT CCPA WAS WRITTEN TO ENCOMPASS ALL TECHNOLOGIES -- AND YOU KNOW WE WE UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS -- YOU KNOW TECHNOLOGY THAT IS -- GROWING AND PEOPLE ARE LEARNING MORE ABOUT -- BUT WE THINK THAT TECHNOLOGY SPECIFIC BILL I'M WHEN WE'RE STILL DEALING WITH THE C. C. PAY AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT I'M MAY NOT BE NECESSARY -- AND ESPECIALLY WITH THE A BREATH OF THE CCPA IN THE PERSONAL INFORMATION DEFINITION IN CCPA WHICH IS WHICH DOES COVER -- RECORDINGS AUDIO VISUAL I'M PURCHASE HISTORY MANY OTHER THINGS -- IN THE C. C. P. AS YOU ALL ARE VERY WELL AWARE AT THIS POINT AND SO WE DO BELIEVE THAT ENTERING AND HAVING A NEW BILL THAT IS NOT. INTRODUCING A CONSUMER OPT IN WHEN WE ALREADY HAVE A CONSUMER OPT OUT COULD BRING ON A LEVEL OF CONFUSION TO THIS MARKET PLACE -- AGAIN WE ARE CONTINUING TO ROUTE REVIEW THE LANGUAGE BUT SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE IDENTIFIED THERE'S NO DEFINITION OF THIRD PARTY -- WRITTEN CONSENT -- YOU KNOW THAT COULD BE A WITH A WHOLE HOST OF THINGS IF WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT -- AUTHORIZATION AND THAT MAYBE SOMETHING BY A WRITTEN CONSENT -- COULD BE VERY BROAD AND THERE'S NO DEFINITION OF HOW THAT THAT WOULD -- TAKE PLACE IN A LOT -- SHARING -- THERE'S NO DEFINITION OF SHARING OR SOLD -- DURING INSTALLATION WHAT DOES THAT NECESSARILY MEAN -- SO GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE'VE SEEN THIS BILL ON FRIDAY THE LANGUAGE ON FRIDAY WORD WERE WORKING THROUGH A WHOLE HOST OF ISSUES THAT WE CAN SEND YOU TO SEE AND THIS LANGUAGE. AND AND SO WE ARE IN AN OPPOSE POSITION AND BASED ON THAT -- EVEN THOUGH WE APPRECIATE THE THE WORK OF THIS COMMITTEE THANK YOU THANK YOU MUCH ADDITIONAL INDIVIDUALS IN OPPOSITION TERRIBLE WITH CAL CHAMBER -- WE ASSOCIATE OUR COMMENTS FOR THOSE OF TECH NOT AND WE'RE OPPOSITION THANK YOU THANK YOU MUCH NEXT PLEASE. GIVE ME KILLINGS INTERNET SO SHE XIN ALSO IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU MUCH NEXT PLEASE. KELLY HIT WITH COUNTY IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. LET'S BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COM COMMENTS OF THIS WEEK'S FIRST AND THEN MISTER OBERNOLTE THANK YOU I JUST WANNA THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THE BILL HERE -- I'M A CO AUTHOR OF THE SUPPORTING ITS DAY APPRECIATED ESPECIALLY AS TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES -- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE REALLY STATUS THESE SORT OF BASELINE LEVELS OF PRIVACY PARTICULARS PERTAINS TO WHAT'S HAPPENING IN OUR HOMES WHICH I THINK SOME OF OUR MOST. YOU KNOW INTENSE INTERESTING CONVERSATIONS HAPPEN SO I JUST WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL. MR OBERNOLTE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I'M. I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO I'M TRYING TO GET PERSONALLY TO POSITION OF SUPPORT BUT I HAVE SOME SERIOUS CONCERNS THAT I JUST WANT TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT. FIRST WILL JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT I'M UNDERSTANDING CORRECTLY BECAUSE THE ANALYSIS ISN'T VERY CLEAR. THE YOU'VE MOVE WHERE THIS BILL THE SECTION OF CODE THAT THIS BILL IS LOCATED IN RIGHT IN THE IN THE AMENDMENTS SO. IS IT OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT YOU'RE TAKING COMPLETELY DID DELETE THE ENTIRE BILL IT'S IN PRINT AND REPLACE IT WITH THE AMENDMENTS IN THE ANALYSIS IS THAT RIGHT THAT'S CORRECT AND THE THE REASON FOR THAT AND WORKING WITH COMMITTEE STAFF WAS THAT WE ORIGINALLY HAD THE CONCEPT OF THIS -- IN AND WE'RE GONNA AND THEN THE CIVIL CODE AND SINCE THE THERE'S A BASELINE ALREADY AND A STATUE IN THE BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE THAT APPLIES. TO SMART TELEVISIONS SO IT MADE A LOT MORE SENSE TO PUT THIS LANGUAGE INTO THE BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE AND EXTENDED TO OTHER TYPES OF ENABLED DEVICES. I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU I THINK IT MAKES A LOT MORE SENSE THE WAY THAT YOU'VE DONE IT IN THE AMENDMENTS YOU CAN THANK COMMITTEE BECAUSE IT WAS THIRD. FOR AWHILE MANY LET'S TAKE IT OFF AND WHAT WELL I'M IF I'M TAKING COMMITTEE LET ME JUST SAY THAT IT WOULD BE MUCH MORE HELPFUL BEFORE FOR THOSE OF US THAT LIKE TO DO THINGS ELECTRONICALLY WHEN YOU SAY STRIKE OUTLINES BLANK THROUGH BLANK. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THAT MEANS THERE'S NO LINE NUMBERS ON THE ELECTRON AREA SO WE'LL MAKE THAT TOP. OUR UPLAND LET'S TALK ABOUT THE THE MY MAJOR PROBLEM THAT'S REMAINING WITH THE BILL WHICH IS THE WORD STORED. SO THE WAY THAT YOU'VE GOT THE BILL WORDED RIGHT NOW -- ACTUAL AUDIO RECORDINGS OF SPOKEN WORDS COLLECTED THROUGH THE DEVICES CANNOT BE STORED AND LESS THE CONSUMER PROVIDES A WRITTEN CONSENT. AND I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT BECAUSE AS A SOMEONE THAT HAS. WRITTEN CODE FOR THESE KINDS OF SYSTEMS BEFORE I CAN TELL YOU IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO GET THE DEVICE TO TO OPERATE WITHOUT STORING IT SO I MEAN. IN LAYMAN'S TERMS YOUR AMAZON SPEAKER IS IS GOT A MICROPHONE AND WHEN YOUR ARE TALKING. IT'S IT'S DIGITIZING YOU KNOW THE THE THE MICRA THE INPUT FROM THE MICROPHONE AND STORING THAT IN COMPUTER MEMORY AND THEN IT'S LOOKING AND TRYING TO PARSE THAT INTO WORDS MATCHING UP AGAINST YOUR VOICE. RIGHT -- IT CAN'T GET PAST THAT FIRST STEP. WITHOUT STORING IT IN MEMORY IT'S GOT TO BE STORED THERE FIRST AND SO. I'M NOT SURE THAT YOU MEANT IT TO BE THAT BROAD. BUT IF YOU MEANT IT TO BE MORE NARROW LIKE. IT CAN'T BE TRANSMITTED BACK UP TO THE MOTHER SHIP. OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THAT IN THAT ANY IDEA IS SO BECAUSE STILL WHEN YOU SAY STORED IN A TECHNICAL SENSE THE MOMENT. YOU READ THAT MICROPHONE INTO COMPUTER MEMORY IT'S BEEN STORED. IT'S AYE AYE STE I SEE YOUR POINT THAT'S A THAT'S A GREAT POINT YEAH THAT -- WHAT WE'RE SEEKING TO PREVENT IS THE RETENTION OF PERSONAL CONVERSATIONS ARE RECORDED? I ASSUME IT'S GOING IN THE CLOUD WORSE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT IT'S TRANSMITTED BACK TO THE MOTHER SHIP. SO IF WE NEED TO TIGHTEN THE LANGUAGE TO ACCOMPLISH CYCLE THAT I THINK WE SHOULD TAKE THE LANGUAGE. I MEAN THERE'S BECAUSE THERE'S NO TEMPORAL ASPECT TO STORED AS WE'VE WRITTEN. THIS IS IF I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN CREDIT RIGHT SO GOES IN THE RAM OR SOMETHING RIGHT COMPUTER MEMORY OF YOUR STORY SO THEY WOULD HAVE. THIS SITE WHICH POTENTIALLY COULD RENDER THE DEVICE IS NON FUNCTIONAL. RIGHT YES YEAH THAT'S A PROBLEM SO. WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON RICH REFINING INFORMATION WHAT WE'RE SEEKING. TO TO PREVENT IS THE ON CONSENTED. TO RECORDING AND RETENTION OF PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS IN THE HOME. SO SO -- OKAY SO LET ME IT'S TRICKY STUFF THESE ARE YOU KNOW YEAH SO LET ME TALK ABOUT A MORE NUANCED. CONCERNED WITH THE WORD STORED SO. THE OTHER WAY THESE DEVICES WORK THAT THEY'RE VERY SOPHISTICATED AND THEY'RE TRAINED OVER TIME NUANCES OF USERS VOICE SO IF I'M. SAYING IF I SAY TOMATO INSTEAD OF TOMATO. OVER TIME IT'S GOING TO PICK THAT UP. IF I SAY POTATO INSTEAD OF TOMATO IT CAN LOOK IN THE CONTEXT OF WHAT I'VE SAID THE SENTENCE AND REALIZE WHAT I MEANT EVEN THOUGH THAT MIGHT MAYBE WAS ALL GARBLED ARTS LEARN A LITTLE BIT WHEN I SAID IT. SO. YOU KNOW THAT HAS GOT TO PERSIST AND MAYBE THAT'S NOT DATA THAT COULD SET UP TO THE MOTHER SHIP. BUT CERTAINLY WITHIN THE DEVICE THAT'S THINGS THAT THAT'S THAT'S INFORMATION IS USEFUL FOR THE CONSUMER TO HAVE THEIR SO. YOU KNOW I I THINK THAT THE THE CONCEPT OF WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IS YOU DON'T WANT. THIS RECORDED CONVERSATION BEING SET UP TO A SERVER SOMEWHERE THAT. THAT SOMEONE AT THE COMPANY CAN ACCESS AND YOU DON'T WANT SOMEONE TO BE ABLE. TO CONNECT TO THE DEVICE AND GET ACCESS TO THAT INFORMATION BUT I THINK IT'S OKAY IF THE DEVICE CAN USE THAT INFORMATION IN ITS OPERATION. SO IF YOU'RE GOING TO USE THE WORD STORED IN THERE I THINK IT'S GOING TO REQUIRE. A LOT OF TECHNICAL FOCUS ON EXACTLY WHAT YOU MEAN BY STORED. WELL I I'D WELCOME A COUPLE THINGS AND THEN I'D LIKE MY WITNESS I THINK HE HAS SOMETHING TO SAID TO ADDRESS THAT AS WELL AND HE'S PROBABLY MORE TECHNICAL. TECHNICALLY SAVVY THAN I I GUESS NOT BUT HAVING A YEAH I I WOULD ADD TO THIS THIS THOUGHT THOUGH. IF PEOPLE WANT THAT ENHANCE EXPERIENCE WHERE THERE'S A MACHINE LEARNING ELEMENT AND IT CAME OUT IN THE MEDIA COUPLE WEEKS AGO AMAZON'S GOT A THOUSAND POLICE INTO FOUR DIFFERENT COUNTRIES ARE ACTUALLY GOING THROUGH CONVERSATIONS MAY. YOU KNOW MANUALLY AND TRANSCRIBING THINGS AND SENDING THAT DATA BACK TO THE COMPANY. AND I PRESUME AND THEY'RE DOING THAT. TO INCREASE THE USER EXPERIENCE SO THAT THEY CAN LEARN TO MADE OVERSEAS TOMATO AND SO FORTH MAYBE DIALECTS ACCENTS WHAT HAVE YOU. I DO THINK THE CONSUMER SHOULD BE GIVEN A CHOICE THOUGH IF THAT COMES AT A COST OF THEIR PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS IN THE HOME BEING. A RECORDED AND RETAINED BY A COMPANY I THINK THE CONSUMER SHOULD HAVE. LIKE YOU COULD SAY AND IT SHE'S GOT A GOOD POINT I THINK ON WHICH IS VERY ARTICULATE. AND MAKES A GOOD POINT ON THE THE THAT WE PROBABLY NEED TO REFINE HOW THE WRITTEN CONSENT WOULD WORK -- WE DO THIS WITH WARRANTY CARDS AND THINGS OF THAT SORT HE COULD SENSE SOMETHING AND YOU COULD HAVE AN EMAIL HEY WOULD YOU LIKE THE ENHANCED EXPERIENCE. IF SO YOU KNOW. DO YOU CONSENT TO US -- RECORDINGS. YOUR VERBAL COMMANDS AND YOU PUTTING THEM THROUGH A MACHINE LEARNING PROCESS OR SOMETHING TO IMPROVE YOUR PRODUCTS OF A YOU KNOW YOU MAKE SURE YOU GET ROCK MUSIC CANNOT COUNTRY OR WHATEVER IT IS. AND THEN PEOPLE CAN SEND AN EMAIL IN THERE AND YOU KNOW THAT I WOULD SUBMIT THAT PROBABLY SOLVE A PROBLEM THAT WOULD PUT THE CONSUMER BACK IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT OF THAT. OF THAT DECISION RIGHT NOW THE DECISIONS BE MADE FOR THEM WITHOUT THEIR KNOWLEDGE WHEN THEY BUY THE DEVICE SO THIS IS REALLY GETTING TO THE CRUX OF OUR DISAGREEMENT BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE. A PROBLEM WITH MY SMART SPEAKER RECORDING AND DOING ALL OF THIS ANALYTICS ON MY MY VOICE AS LONG AS IT NEVER GOES ANYWHERE ELSE. I ANY OTHER PEOPLE DOES GO SOMEWHERE ELSE THOUGH I THINK IT GOES TO THE CLOUD UNDER THAT ON THAT'S HOW THEY ARE ABLE TO GET IT IN THE HANDS OF THE INTERNAL IS NUANCED CASES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. YOU KNOW WHERE IT'S JUST USED IN ITS RETAIN STORED IF YOU WILL BUT IT'S USED. YOU KNOW INTERNALLY IN THE DEVICE TO IMPROVE THE USER EXPERIENCE IN THE FUTURE I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT. SOURCE SAYING THAT YOU DO HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT YOU NEED YOU YOU THINK THAT. A USER SHOULD HAVE TO PROVIDE WRITTEN CONSENT. YEAH I I I DO HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT. I I THINK THAT THE MAJORITY OF OUR CONSTITUENTS WOULD HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT AND I THINK THAT AN OPT IN MAKES SENSE BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO HAVE SAFEGUARDS FOR PRIVACY COMMENSURATE WITH THE THREAT TO PRIVACY IN THE THREAT TO PRIVACY OF A DEVICE THAT. IN YOUR HOME IN YOUR BEDROOMS IN YOUR KITCHENS. INTERCONNECTED AND BEAMING THINGS BACK BUT YOU'RE SAYING TO YOUR KIDS AND YOUR SPOUSE OR PARTNER -- CONSTANTLY AT THAT'S THAT'S A PRETTY BIG THREAT I MEAN THERE'S THERE'S NO WAY AROUND THAT I THINK AND SO I I'M. I'M SAYING I THINK IT SHOULD BE AN OPT IN SYSTEM. BEFORE A COMPANY CAN RECORD YOUR PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS. AND IN I'M NOT TRYING. TO PROHIBIT THE THE USE OF MACHINE LEARNING OR THE USE OF THESE CONVERSATIONS IN A IN A MANNER THAT. MAKES THE PRODUCT BETTER -- BUT YOU KNOW WHAT'S WRONG WITH SAYING LOOK YOU YOU GOT TWO OPTIONS WE CAN MAKE THE SMART SPEAKER THE GREATEST THING THAT'S EVER EXISTED IT CAN -- YOU KNOW. IN TEN YEARS WILL BE READING OUR MINDS OF PUTTING COUNTRY MUSIC ON FOR YOU GET UP I DON'T KNOW. AS A SO. BUT YOU KNOW IF PEOPLE WANT TO HAVE. CONFIDENCE THAT THE DEVICE IS NOT. EFFECTIVELY POTENTIALLY SPYING ON THEM -- PASSIVELY ALBEIT BUT IN A RECORDING THINGS THAT THEY HAVE NOT GIVEN IT PERMISSION TO RECORD. THEY CAN OPT FOR I GUESS THE LOWER TECH VERSION. SO YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GOOD IF YOU IF IF I GIVE A VERBAL COMMAND AND YOU KIND OF MISS UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT AND YOU PUT ON LED ZEPPELIN'S SAID OF THE STONES THEN. I'M OKAY WITH THAT. MIKE I'D RATHER BE SURE THAT THIS THING IS NOT RECORDING WHAT I'M SAYING TO MAKE IT. SO IT'S IT SOUNDS LIKE. WE HAVE A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION ABOUT THAT -- I WOULD I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO HELP YOU GET THE BILL TO PLACE WHERE -- HELP IS APPRECIATED AND WANTED OKAY SO I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I'M I'M GONNA LAY OFF TODAY. AND I'D LOVE TO WORK WITH YOU IN THE FUTURE TO TRY AND GET GET THIS TO PLACE WHERE WE'RE RESPECTING. THE PRIVACY CONCERNS WHICH ADMITTEDLY ARE THERE AND NEED TO BE ADDRESSED YOU KNOW WHILE STILL. ALLOWING THE DEVICE TO FUNCTION IN A WAY THAT BENEFITS CONSUMERS. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT. LET'S GO TO MY SPOKANE. THANK YOU I WAS RUNNING AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR IN THIS BILL I DON'T HAVE ONE OF THESE DEVICES BECAUSE I AGREE WITH YOU HOME IS THERE A SACRED PLACE I WAS AT A FRIEND'S HOUSE AND HE PULLED UP HIS -- FEET ON HIS AMAZON DEVICE SHOWING ME HOW MANY BITS OF HIS CONVERSATION IT HAD RECORDED ON I WAS. SHOCKED AND I AGREE WITH YOU THE BOTH THE JUDICIAL AND LEGISLATIVE BRANCHES OF OVER TIMES OF THEWHAT HAPPENS IN THE SANCTITY OF THE HOME IS ABSOLUTELY ONE OF THE MOST PRIVATE SPHERES AND IT IS INCUMBENT UPON US TO PROTECT IT. BUT IN ALL OF THAT I ACTUALLY DON'T HEAR MUCH OF DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND THE OPPOSITION. I THINK THAT FIRST ON THE DEFINITIONS I'VE ALREADY HEARD MISTER CUNNINGHAM SAY THAT HE'S ABSOLUTELY HAPPY TO FIND CONSENT SO THAT THAT'S A WORKABLE. TERM DIED SOMEWHERE RIGHT -- AND ALSO ON THE COMPUTER LEARNING PIECE I MEAN EVERY. WE HEAR BILLS EVER HEARING THE DEAL WITH THE IDENTIFIED DATA AND ALLOW FOR THAT KIND OF WORK WHERE IT IS WE JUST DID A BILL WHERE WAS AGGREGATE IN DE IDENTIFIED AND WOULD ENABLE THE TYPE OF COMPUTER LEARNING THAT YOU'RE LOOKING. FOR WITHOUT STORING THE TYPE OF CONVERSATIONS THAT MR CUNNINGHAM IS CONCERNED ABOUT AND SO I THINK THAT IN YOUR CONCERN ABOUT THE ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO MAKE THESE DEVICES SMARTER THERE IS A WAY TO PROTECT THE PRIVACY OF THESE CONVERSATIONS. AND SO I WOULD URGE BOTH OF YOU TO WORK TOGETHER ON A SOLUTION THAT IS WORKABLE BECAUSE I THINK THAT AT THE END OF THE DAY WE NEED TO PROTECT. THE PRIVACY OF THESE CONVERSATIONS I DON'T HEAR ANYTHING IN THE OPPOSITION THAT WOULD MAKE THAT AND WORKABLE THANK YOU. MR GALLAGHER GO AHEAD. YEAH I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND I'M ALSO A CO AUTHOR SO I YOU KNOW. VERY STRONGLY BELIEVE IN WHAT HE'S TRYING TO DO HERE AND I I THINK THAT YOU KNOW THERE ARE OBVIOUSLY SOME THINGS THAT WE CAN THAT WE CAN WORK THROUGH HERE AND THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT OF THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS BY THE WAY IS TO CONTINUALLY TAKE INPUT. MAKE SURE THIS IS GOOD POLICY AT THE END OF THE DAY IT'S WORKABLE -- BUT TWO VERY IMPORTANT THINGS THAT I THAT I THINK MAYBE A LITTLE BIT. MISSING HERE YEAH I THINK IT SHOULD BE OFTEN. WHEN IT WHEN IT COMES TO YOUR HOME IT SHOULD BE OFTEN YOU KNOW BECAUSE THESE ARE VERY PROUD THIS IS THE MOST PRIVATE? YOU KNOW SACRED PLACE IN THE WORLD IS THE HOME. YOU KNOW AND WE AND I THINK WE'VE ALWAYS AGREED UPON THAT AND SO. YES I THINK IT SHOULD BE OFTEN ALSO THERE SHOULD BE A NOTICE ABOUT HEY HOW IS THIS. BEING USED AND I THINK THAT'S ALSO THE INTENT HERE IS IS TO IS TO REALLY CLEARLY SAY WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO BE DOING ARE YOU GOING TO BE RECORDING. INFORMATION SO THAT PEOPLE KNOW THAT NOW YES WE BALD NOW DISCOVERED THAT AMAZON DOES THIS ONLY BECAUSE IT BROKE IN A NEWS STORY NOT BECAUSE THEY CAME FORWARD AND VOLUNTARILY GAVE THAT INFORMATION OUT TO PEOPLE -- WE DIDN'T FIND OUT ABOUT GOOGLE NAST BECAUSE GOOGLE DECIDED. TO FINALLY TO FINALLY TELL US ABOUT THAT -- YOU KNOW IT'S IS AGAIN THIS STUFF SHOULD BE ON THE FRONT END HERE'S HOW WE'RE DOING THIS ARE YOU OKAY WITH IT. NO IN AND IT'S EITHER YES OR NO AND AND LOOK I THINK THERE IS A WORKABLE WAY OF DOING THAT WHILE STILL GIVING YOU THE BENEFIT. OF WHAT THIS TECHNOLOGY PROVIDES AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY THE YOU KNOW THE FUNDAMENTAL THING OF WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO WITH THIS BILL -- CERTAINLY WILL CONTINUE TO WORK THROUGH SOME OF THE TWEAKS AT I THINK WHAT MY COLLEAGUE -- FROM BIG BEAR LAKE HAS BROUGHT UP IS IS SOME VERY GOOD POINTS ABOUT HOW THIS ACTUALLY WORKS IN. FUNNY WAYS TO ACTUALLY YOU KNOW -- ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS -- BUT AGAIN THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE HERE IS THAT YES YOU KNOW. IF IF OTHERS ARE GOING TO BE LISTENING TO YOUR LET ME GET ONE CLARIFICATION FROM YOU MISTER JENSEN SO. IS IT. ARE THESE RECORDINGS ONLY IF YOU VIEWS THE WAKE WORD. OR THEIR RECORDINGS THAT HAVE BEEN RANDOMLY TAKEN FROM CONVERSATIONS IN THE HOME AND I GUESS MAYBE THE ONE OF THE PROBLEMS IS. DUE EVEN REALLY KNOW. AS CHAIR RIGHT. AND SO. THE WAY IT SO WHEN YOU USE THE WAKE WORD OF THE HOT WHEREVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT AND THOSE THAT THAT IS WHAT'S RECORDED IT WILL LIST SAN FOR IN LIKE TWO SECONDS FIGHTS FOR THE WAKE WORD BUT THOSE ARE NEVER STORED OR TRANSMITTED TO THE CLOUD OR THE SERVER. OR WHATEVER STORING IN SO DOING THINGS THAT ARE STORED IS WHEN YOU USE THE HOT WORD OR WAKE BOARD IF YOU WANT TO ENSURE THAT THAT'S TRUE WHICH IT YEAH THAT'S WHAT I'M TELLING YOU BUT IF THE IF THE CONSUMER WANTS TO ENSURE THAT THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING. THEY CAN GO INTO THEIR ACCOUNT ON THEIR APPS -- OR ONLINE INTO THEIR ACCOUNT AND SEE EVERYTHING THE DEVICES RECORDED AND THEY CAN LEAVE THOSE RECORDINGS THERE IF THEY WANT THE DEVICE TO CONTINUE TO LEARN HOW THEIR SPEECH WORKS OR THEY CAN GO IN AND MANUALLY AND DELETE EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE RECORDINGS OR RECORD. OR DELETE SOME OF THE RECORDINGS OR WHATEVER THEY WANT TO DO BUT THEY CAN MANAGE THOSE RECORDINGS THAT'S ALREADY THAT ALREADY EXISTS THE COMPANIES HAVE GIVEN CONSUMERS CONTROL OVER THIS TECHNOLOGY. AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU KNOW WE KEEP HEARING IS CAN YOU WANT CONSUMER CONTROL THAT ALREADY EXISTS WITHIN CCPA THE NOTICES IN EXISTENCE THE CPA AND THEN THEY ALSO EXIST WITH WHAT MANUFACTURERS HAVE DONE TO MAKE SURE THAT CONSUMERS. ARE TRUSTING THEIR DEVICES IN THEIR HOMES. IN IT AND I THINK THAT'S PART OF THIS IS LIKE LET'S PUT THAT ON THE FRONT END. YOU KNOW IT'S REALLY PUT THAT ON THE FRONT AND HERE'S WHAT WE DO -- BECAUSE THAT HASN'T BEEN DONE I MEAN I THINK UNDER THE STATUS QUO THAT'S NOT WHAT'S HAPPENING I MEAN YOU FIND OUT ABOUT THIS SORT OF WAY -- YOU CAN GO ON YOUR PRIVACY PROTECTIONS BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH THAT'S REALLY. OUT THERE AT THE OUTSET. IF MR GABRIEL GO AHEAD. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SIR JUST A QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR I YOU KNOW I KNOW HERE THAT THAT WE'RE DEFINING SMART SPEAKER DEVICES TO FIND IS NOT INCLUDING A CELLULAR TELEPHONE AND SO I'M JUST CURIOUS ABOUT WHY THAT DECISION WAS MADE [inaudible] WELL THE MY ORIGINAL INTENT WAS TO FOCUS THIS. WITHOUT BEING TOO TECHNOLOGICAL TECHNOLOGY SPECIFIC AT DEVICES THAT ARE IN THE HOME. AND WE'RE AS CELLULAR TELEPHONES POSE A DIFFERENT. SET OF ISSUES I THINK IN THE ATTEMPTING -- TO APPLY NEW LOSS OF THEM BECAUSE THEY TRAVEL EVERYWHERE WITH YOU. I GO TO YOUR CAR THEY GO HERE COMMITTEES THEY GO. TO NOW YOUR BALL GAMES THEY ALL OVER THE PLACE. SO -- IS THAT THAT'S THE REASON FOR THE DISTINCTION. I MEAN I THINK THE WAY. IT'S DRAFTED NOW -- IT MAY NOTED SAYS CONNECTED DEVICE WITH THE VOICE RECOGNITION FEATURE. AND THAT'S OF THIS ABOUT PROBABLY AS NEUTRAL AS WE CAN GET AS I'M SORRY SO THAT IS AS YOU CAN BECAUSE YOU CAN YOU KNOW LOOK AT THE HOUSES AS A SMART SPEAKER DEVICE SHALL NOT INCLUDE A CELLULAR TELEPHONE -- IF I COULD HAVE MY WHAT I THINK I THINK THE AMENDMENT DOES SO PROVIDE FOR THE CELL OF OF PHONE ON PAGE -- EIGHT SECTION BE. SECOND PARAGRAPH -- SECOND TO THE LAST LINE I THINK IT DOES INCLUDE A SOLAR PHONE. IF I MADE IT THROUGH THE CHAIR. ONE AMPLIFICATION OF OF RECKLESS TWO APPLICATIONS THE FIRST IS THE BLOOMBERG STOCK BLOOMBERG STORY DID -- DISCLOSE THAT IT WASN'T JUST WAKE WORDS THAT WERE BEING RECORDED BUT I BELIEVE IT WAS WELL OVER A HUNDRED WORDS PER DAY SO IT IT WAS NOT SIMPLY THAT THE SIGNAL WORK THAT WAS BEING RECORDED BUT A MUCH MORE SUBSTANCE. THAN THAT. ON ALL BUT ONE OTHER. THE THE THE ASSEMBLYMEMBER OBERNOLTE IS POINTS ARE ALWAYS EXTRAORDINARILY WELL AFFORDABLE TAKEN ON THESE MATTERS -- OF THE TECHNICAL MATTERS THE ONE THING I WILL NOTE IS THAT THE PROTECTIONS AFFORDED TO THE BILL GO TO TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER GALLAGHER'S POINT. WHICH IS THAT WHAT WE'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT HERE. THE TECHNICAL ISSUES. THAT NEED TO BE AMPLIFIED AND RESULT. IS WHAT DO YOU DO ABOUT IT. AND THE THINGS THAT ARE REQUIRED BY THIS BILL. FRANKLY EMBRACE BOTH KINDS OF SENSITIVITIES TO PERSONAL PRIVACY -- THE IT MAY VERY WELL BE THE CASE ASSEMBLY MEMBER THAT YOU HAVE NO PRIVACY RADISSON'S. WHEN IT COMES TO THE RECORDING? A RETENTION BETTER OF WAKE WORDS OR SIGNAL WORDS BUT OTHERS MAY. AND WHAT THE BILL PERMITS IS BOTH SENSITIVITIES TO BE PROTECTED. BECAUSE IF DURING THE INITIAL STAGE OF THE SET UP FOR INSTALLATION. YOU DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE THE THE MACHINE IN THE WAY THAT IT HANDLES -- YOUR VERBAL COMMUNICATION YOU MAY CONSENT TO IT. LIKEWISE YOU MAY CONSENT -- IN WRITING WHERE SOMEONE WITH A DIFFERENT SENSITIVITY. MAY COME TO A DIFFERENT CONCLUSION AND THAT'S THE WAY THAT WE PRETTY MUCH PROTECT PRIVACY IN AMERICA. THAT IS BY ALLOWING CONSUMERS -- THE INFORMATION UP FRONT. AND PROPORTIONAL TO THE RISK OF INVASION. REQUIRING EITHER AN OPT IN OR OPT OUT. IN THAT WAY ALL THE WHOLE GAMUT OF PERSONAL SENSITIVITIES WHEN IT COMES TO PRIVACY. ARE PROTECTED AT THE MOST INDIVIDUAL LEVEL AND SUBJECTIVE LEVEL HUMANLY POSSIBLE AND THAT'S WHY IT WAS SUCH A IT INSPIRED SUGGESTION. MISTER CHAIRMAN OF FROM THE COMMITTEE TO SIMPLY ADD THIS ON TO THE MOST ANALOGOUS PRODUCT THAT ALREADY EXISTS. IN CURRENT LAW. WHICH WAS THAT THE TELEVISION. WITH THE TEARS FROM JUST LIKE TO CLARIFY SPOTS OF THE I THINK I MISUNDERSTOOD YOUR QUESTION IT'S BEING DIRECTED THE OLD VERSION THE BILL. THE NEW VERSION BILL DOES APPLY TO PHONES AND TABLETS AT ALL IT'S THE THE NEUTRAL LANGUAGE -- THE THAT I READ. OTHER CONNECTED DEVICE WITH THE VOICE RECOGNITION FEATURE. I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR ON ON ON ON THE RECORD AS THE CHAIR POINTED OUT. ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS SIR. YES -- FOR UNDERGRAD. NO FILIBUSTER FOR A LITTLE BIT WELL ACTUALLY DECIDED I'M GONNA VOTE -- BECAUSE BECAUSE OKAY BECAUSE I'M STRUGGLING -- THAT'S RIGHT -- SO I HAVE A LOT OF CONCERNS AND I THINK OF THIS FOR THE FINAL FORM OF THE BILL I DEFINITELY GO NO -- HI IT'S IT'S EASY TO SAY YOU KNOW -- WILL YOU KNOW CERTAIN DEVICES YOU KNOW IF YOU CAN SEND THEM THE DEVICE WILL BE ABLE TO USE -- YOU KNOW -- A AYE TECHNOLOGY THE BETTER PERFECT THE USER EXPERIENCE -- AND THEN IF SO IF YOU IF YOU DON'T WANT THAT THEN YOU CAN VOLUNTARILY NOT HAVE THAT BUT IT'S NOT ACTUALLY THAT THAT'S ACTUALLY INCREDIBLY COMPLICATED IN TERMS OF THE IMPACT THAT HAS. IN IN THE MARKET PLACE BECAUSE PEOPLE WHO SAY WELL I DON'T WANT YOU TO USE A I'D TO TO PERFECT THE EXPERIENCE BUT THEN THEY'RE GONNA GET ON REVIEW SITES AND TRASH OUR PRODUCTS. BECAUSE THEY'RE ESSENTIALLY USING AN INFERIOR PRODUCT -- AND THEY CHOSE TO USE AN INFERIOR PRODUCT BUT THEN THEY GO ON IT IN IN INTO THE TO THE DOMAIN OF OF REVIEWS AND THEY TRASHED THE PRODUCT WITHOUT NECESSARILY SAYING HEY BY THE WAY. I'M REALLY USING AN INFERIOR PRODUCT BECAUSE I VOLUNTARILY MADE THAT CHOICE BY THIS PRODUCT SUCKS WHEN I DON'T WANT TO DO ALL THAT IT REALLY SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO -- AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S FAIR TO TO THE COMPANY -- WAIT WHICH DO WHO DESIGNS THE PRODUCT IN A WAY THAT'S MEANT TO MAXIMIZE THE THE USER EXPERIENCE WHEN A USER DECIDES VOLUNTARILY NOT. TO AVAIL THEMSELVES OF OF THAT OPPORTUNITY -- AND SO I THINK THAT'S JUST MUCH MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAN IT SOUNDS WHEN YOU TO SAY YOU CAN VOLUNTARILY USE IT OR NOT -- BECAUSE THAT HAS A BROADER IMPACT ON ON THE REPUTATION OF THE COMPANY AND AND THE REPUTATION OF THE PRODUCT -- I THINK THE IDEA OF SENDING IN A A POSTCARD OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT IS MUCH MORE ONEROUS THAN WE MAKE IT SOUND LIKE IT IS I MEAN I GOT A NEW DISHWASHER. THEY GIVE ME A LITTLE CARD TO GET THE WARRANTY AND I I DID YOU KNOW. WHAT WAS GONNA NOT BOTHER FILLING IT OUT BECAUSE I COULDN'T BE BOTHERED ON THAT I COULD AT LEAST LIKE TO TAKE A? CUE OUR SCAN OF A CO I MEAN I COULD DO IT A LOT EASIER. THAN IT THAN SENDING A POSTCARD BY THE SENATE A POSTCARD I PROBABLY SAID FORGET IT. FORGET FORGET MY POSTCARD IDEA. BUT YOU KNOW EMAIL OR OR SOME OR TAKE A PICTURE AND SEND IT TO SOME MAYBE THERE YEAH TECHNOLOGICAL SOLUTION I'M SURE TO THE WRITTEN CONSENT ISSUE YEAH -- I MEAN I I I TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU THAT COMPANIES NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB. OF MAKING THEIR THEIR CONSUMERS AWARE OF ALL THAT IS HAPPENING WITH THE PRODUCT THAT THEY BY AND AND SO FOR THAT. YOU KNOW YOU AND I ARE TOTALLY ALIGNED -- I I THINK THAT AND IF -- HE COMPANIES OR THE DOING MORE THAN THEY SAY THEY'RE DOING I MEAN IF THEY SAY THAT THEY'RE JUST RECORDING SO YOU KNOW CERTAIN PHRASES TO BUT IT TO BETTER THE EXPERIENCE. THAT'S ONE THING IF THEY'RE ACTUALLY RECORD YOU KNOW RECORDING A LOT MORE AND USING THAT INFORMATION TO THEN. YEAH -- THE SELL THAT TO PEOPLE WHO THEN MARKET CERTAIN PRODUCTS TO YOU FOR EXAMPLE I THINK THAT'S YOU KNOW PRETTY BAD -- IT AWFUL IT IF IF YOU HAVEN'T ACTUALLY CONSENTED TO THE USE OF YOUR PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS IN THAT WAY -- AND AND SO I THINK THAT IT YOU KNOW THAT IS ONE THING I THINK -- YEAH RECORDING THE DATA SO THAT THEY CAN BETTER PERFECT THE PRODUCTS BEFORE FOR YOU IS IT IS A DIFFERENT. IS A DIFFERENT SET OF ISSUES I ALSO THINK AND YOU AND I HAVE AT SOME PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT DE IDENTIFIED DATA -- IN AND WHETHER OR NOT DATA THAT'S THE IDENTIFIED SHOULD REALLY FALL UNDER THE SAME AND THEN USED FOR MARKETING PURPOSES OR THE LIKE AND AND SO I THINK. THERE NEEDS TO BE THE DELINEATION BETWEEN THOSE THINGS IN THE BILL AND AND DIFFERENT DATA TREATED. DIFFERENTLY. BECAUSE IT HAS A DIFFERENT IMPACT ON OUR ON OUR PART YOU KNOW PRIVACY RIGHTS -- SO THERE'S A LOT AND THERE'S A LOT THAT IS IN IN HERE YET. AND AND I I DON'T KNOW. THE YOU KNOW AND IT'S IT'S FAR FROM OUT OF PLACE FROM SUPER COMFORTABLE WITH IT -- YOU KNOW I I I THINK YEAH BUT I KNOW YOU AND THEN I KNOW THAT YOU'RE INTERESTED IN IN GETTING THE RIGHT POLICY AT THE END OF THE DAY SO. I'M GONNA STOP FILIBUSTERING INTERNET OVER MR GABRIEL -- BUT YOU KNOW IF IF THIS DOES MAKE IT OUT TODAY -- YOU KNOW I I I KNOW AND HOPE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO KEEP ON GETTING FEEDBACK FROM A LOT OF FOLKS INCLUDING YOU KNOW SOME COLLEAGUES ON THE COMMITTEE WHO ARE GOOD. SUGGESTIONS -- BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT THE THE INTENT IS RIGHT THIS IS A LOT IN HERE THAT THAT DOESN'T GET TO THE INTENT AND ACTUALLY HAS I THINK HARMFUL CONSEQUENCES. HELLO OFFER A FEW MORE COMMENTS OR MY CALL I CAN MAKE UP HIS MIND HERE ON THIS BILL -- LOOK I I JUST WANNA SAY I AM I REALLY APPRECIATE WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE -- I THINK THAT -- THE INTENT IS THERE -- I AGREE WITH A LOT OF THE COMMENTS OF OF MY COLLEAGUE ACROSS THE DICE HERE THAT THIS IS A SPHERE DESERVING OF A SPECIAL PRIVACY PROTECTION I THINK ALL OF US FEEL THAT INTUITIVELY I THINK A LOT OF OUR CONSTITUENTS FEEL THAT INTUITIVELY THAT. DEVICES THAT ARE RECORDING YOU IN YOUR OWN HOME IN THE SENSITIVITY OF YOUR HOME AND CONVERSATIONS IN THE PRIVACY OF YOUR BEDROOM AND WE YOU KNOW YOUR KITCHEN WHEREVER THEY MAY BE THOSE ARE THINGS THAT MERITS SPECIAL PRIVACY PROTECTION. I THINK YOU'VE ALSO HEARD FROM A LOT OF FOLKS ON THE COMMITTEE CONCERNS ABOUT THE CURRENT VERSION OF THE BILL -- AND AND YOU KNOW PARTICULARLY SOME OF THE THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF THIS MAY NOT BE QUITE AS EASY AS IT SEEMS SO I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION THAT NEEDS TO CONTINUE -- I THINK THERE'S A LOT IN THIS BILL THAT NEEDS TO BE ADJUSTED AND TWEAK THAT SOUNDS LIKE TO ME THAT YOUR VERY WILLING TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS. TO GET YOU TO LISTEN THAT FEEDBACK -- I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE GOING TO GET THERE IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS BUT I WANT TO GIVE YOU THE CHANCE TO TRYING TO THAN SOME OF THE VOTE TO ADVANCE THIS BILL TODAY BUT RESERVE MY VOTE ON THE FLOOR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OUT ADDITIONAL COMMENTS. ON LET ME -- I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL ON FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT IT STRENGTHENS PRIVACY. ARE OUT LET ME THANK THE AUTHOR AND AND HIS TEAM FOR A MAKING THE AMENDMENTS -- THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF THE BILL I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT INTERFERE OR CONFLICTED WITH THE CPA AND BECAUSE CITY PA DOES PROVIDE FOR THE RIGHT OF DELETION. AND CURRENTLY OBVIOUSLY HAS BEEN MENTIONED THE AMENDMENT SO US TEND. TO MODIFY THE CODE SECTION THAT IS SO IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONNECTED TV. AND THAT'S THE RIGHT PLACE TO TO AMEND THE LAW -- AND AND IT IS THE BILL PERFECT NO I I I THINK OBVIOUSLY WE HEARD US FROM FROM A DISCUSSION. THERE'S SEVERAL AREAS THAT NEED TO BE FINE TUNING ONE OF WHICH IS THE STORAGE ISSUE THAT WE TALK SO MUCH ABOUT AND THE OTHER ISSUES SO WRITTEN CONSENT. AND WHETHER OR NOT WE WANT WHAT KIND OF CONSIDERING CONCERNED TO WE WANT FOR EXAMPLE A WHETHER IT'S E. SIGNATURE OTHERWISE I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO REALLY DIVE INTO A LITTLE BIT MORE -- BUT I THINK THIS BILL IS WORTH UP -- PURSUING ARMED LAW AND ALSO I DO ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS AS WELL AS OPPOSITION I THINK OBVIOUSLY IT'S SHE POINTED OUT SOME ISSUES AS WELL. SO -- YOU KNOW I FEEL COMFORTABLE VOTING FOR TODAY ARE BECAUSE THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT AS THE THE PRIVACY COMMUNITY. ARE SO SO WITH THAT I HEARD A MOTION A TEAMS BALL CAN MAKE THE MOTION DO I HEAR A SECOND. HUSBAND MOVE SECOND SIX OKAY VERY GOOD AND SO WITHOUT WHICH LIKE TO CLOSE. I WOULD JUST SAY THANK YOU FOR THE ROBUST DISCUSSION AND RAISING ALL SORTS OF ISSUES THAT CLEARLY WE NEED TO CONTINUE DOING SOME WORK -- GLAD TO HEAR. YOU NEAR UNIVERSAL AGREEMENT THAT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT PRIVACY INTERESTS AND AT LEAST ARE INTENSE MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION -- YOU HAVE MY COMMITMENT TO CONTINUING TO REFINE THE BILL SO WORKS FOR INDUSTRY DOESN'T HAMPER TECHNOLOGY IN THE SLIGHTEST BIT REALLY.

SEVENTEEN NINETY MISS WICKS ANYTIME YOU'RE READY YOU MAY PROCEED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHAIR MEMBERS AND PRESENTING WITH ME IS. MY CO AUTHOR WHO YOU ARE NOW VERY FAMILIAR WITH IN THIS COMMITTEE. TEN OVER CUNNINGHAM -- I WANT. TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE MOMENTS -- IN THE COMMITTEES ANALYSIS AND AND THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR ALL THEIR WORK ON THIS IT'S BEEN INCREDIBLY HELPFUL SO I'M. ACCEPTING OF THOSE AMENDMENTS AB SEVENTEEN NINETY WHICH IS A BIPARTISAN BILL -- AS PROPOSED PROPOSED TO BE MEN AND WILL HELP LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD FOR SMALL BUSINESSES BY REQUIRING MORE TRANSPARENCY. FROM ALL EACH COMMERCE MARKETPLACES. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU COMMERCE MARKETPLACES AND THIRD PARTY SELLERS WHICH INCLUDES A LOT OF SMALL BUSINESSES IN OUR COMMUNITIES IS CRITICAL TO THE SELLER'S ABILITY TO REACH CUSTOMERS AND GENERATE REVENUE. WITH SUCH A LARGE FOOTPRINT IN THE RETAIL SPACE YOU COMMERCE MARKETPLACES HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THE THIRD PARTY SELLERS KNOW AND UNDERSTAND THE POLICIES. THAT GOVERN THE CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIP PRIOR TO THE SELLER'S USE OF THE PLATFORM. THIS BILL WILL ENSURE THAT THIS TRANSPARENCY EXISTS FOR CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES ENGAGE IN ONLINE RETAIL SALES ON OU COMMERCE MARKET PLACE MART MARKETPLACE PLATFORMS. BY REQUIRING THAT THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR ALL ECOMMERCE MARKET PLACES ONE ARE DRAFTED IN PLAIN. AND INTELLIGIBLE LANGUAGE TO ARE EASILY AVAILABLE. ONLINE FOR MARKETPLACE SELLERS AT ALL STAGES OF THEIR COMMERCIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE MARKET PLACE INCLUDING IN THE PRE CONTRACTUAL STAGE. AND THREE SET OUT THE GROUNDS FOR DECISIONS TO RETAIN OR REFUSE TO DO. AT TO DISTRIBUTE FUNDS IN ITS POSSESSION PENDING INVESTIGATION OR RESOLUTION OF A DISPUTE. THESE REQUIREMENTS ARE SIMILAR REGULATIONS THAT WERE RECENTLY APPROVED BY THE EUROPEAN UNION AND WILL GO INTO EFFECT THERE NEXT YEAR -- I WILL HAVE MY WITNESSES SELF INTRODUCING ASK YOUR AYE VOTE AND WANT TO TURN OVER TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER CUNNINGHAM FOR ANY OTHER THOUGHT THANK YOU THANK YOU AS A CO AUTHOR I JUST ECHO ALL OF THE COMMENTS SHE JUST MADE AND JUST ADD THAT HEALTHY COMPETITIONS VERY IMPORTANT TO A VIBRANT. ECONOMY AND I SEE THIS BILL IS A COMMON SENSE THING THAT'S GOING TO LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH FIRST WITNESS PLEASE. ARMOS CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MARKUP PRAY I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE ONLINE MERCHANTS GUILD AND I WANT TO THANK THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS FOR INTRODUCING THIS MEASURE -- THE ONLINE MERCHANTS GUILD IS MADE UP OF THIRD PARTY SELLERS FROM AROUND THE COUNTRY IN THE ONLINE MERCHANT SKILL PROVIDES. A COMMON VOICE FOR THE DIVERSE GROUP OF MERCHANTS WHO SELL ON AMAZON AND OTHER ONLINE PLATFORMS. AMAZON'S MARKET PLACE TO BE CLEAR HAS BECOME ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT CHANNELS FOR PRIVATE LABEL BRANDS IN THE UNITED STATES WITH AMAZON'S. DOMINANCE OF U. S. ET COMMERCE FOR MANY OF THESE BRANDS AMAZON IS THE ONLY CHANNEL THAT MATTERS IN TERMS OF REVENUE. BUT THAT MARKET PLACE DOMINANCE HAS BECAUSE THE NEED FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO STEP IN AND PROVIDE THIRD PARTY SELLERS PROTECTIONS. THE MARKET PLACE CANNOT. AMAZON IN ITS TERMS AND CONDITIONS DID NOT PROVIDE ANY EFFECTIVE EFFORT. TO COMMUNICATE TO THIRD PARTY SELLERS THAT THE THIRD PARTY SELLERS HAD A DUTY TO COLLECT SALES TAX. THERE WAS NO TRANSPARENCY THERE WAS NO EFFORT BY AMAZON TO NOTIFY THIRD PARTY SELLERS. THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE A TAX OBLIGATION IN THE STATE. AMAZON DID NOT PROVIDE NOTICE TO THESE THIRD PARTY SELLERS OF THE OPTIONS THAT EITHER THE THIRD PARTY SELLER WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR COLLECTING SALES TAX OR THAT AMAZON COULD COLLECT THE SALES TAX. ON THEIR BEHALF INSTEAD IN ITS CONTRACT WITH THESE THIRD PARTY SELLERS. AMAZON MERELY NOTIFIED HIS THIRD PARTY SELLERS QUOTE. AS BETWEEN THE PARTIES YOU'LL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE COLLECTION AND PAYMENT OF ANY AND ALL OF YOUR TAXES. THIS RESULTED IN CREATING A TAXATION SPEED TRAP AND THREATENS TO BANKRUPT VAST NUMBERS OF THIRD PARTY SELLERS. THAT HELP MAKE AMAZON SUCCESSFUL. DESPITE THE FACT THAT AMAZON SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE PARTY RESPONSIBLE FOR COLLECTING BACK TAXES. A DESPITE THE THE THE FOR THE FACT THAT SELLERS WHO HAD THEY KNOWN WOULD HAVE. ENGAGED IN COLLECTING. I THESE TAXPAYERS ARE NOW ON THE HOOK FOR BACK TAXES. FOR THESE REASONS WE ARE ASKING THIS COMMITTEE TO APPROVE THIS MEASURE. SO THAT AS THIRD PARTIES LOOK AT THESE CONTRACTS IN THE FUTURE THEIR OBLIGATIONS ARE CLEAR AND THEY HAVE AN OPPORTUNE OPPORTUNITY TO ABIDE BY THEM. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MATCH A NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- MY NAME IS ANTHONY DANIEL ARROW I AM A PARTNER AT A LAW FIRM ROSE IN DOWNTOWN LARA PC -- WE'RE LOCATED IN NEW YORK AND WE FOCUS ON HELPING SMALL TO MID SIZE BUSINESSES ARE YOU COMMERCE SELLERS -- NAVIGATE THE DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESS IS WITH THE V. COMMERCE MARKETS NOTABLY AMAZON -- IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL I JUST WANT TO PROVIDE A QUICK REAL LIFE EXAMPLE THAT'S ALL TOO COMMON THAT SHOWS. WHERE MANY OF THESE SELLERS FIND THEMSELVES? JUST THIS WEEKEND WE HAD AN INTAKE CALL FROM A CALIFORNIA SELLER LA COUNTY SPECIFICALLY. ON HE HAD BEEN SUSPENDED FOR ABOUT NINETY DAYS -- SIDE AND HE'S DURING THAT SUSPENSION HIS INVENTORIES ROSE IN HIS -- HIS SALES ARE FROZEN AND I WAS ON SAID THE REASON FOR THE SUSPENSION IS THEY WERE UNABLE TO VERIFY CERTAIN BUSINESS INFO. ON THEY ASK FOR UTILITY BILL -- IN WHICH SORRY. PROOF OF PURCHASE FOR THEIR INVENTORY AND BUSINESS LICENSE THAT INFORMATION WAS PROVIDED. AMAZON AS USUAL THEY RESPOND IN TEMPLATE DENIALS THEY DON'T SAY WHAT WAS MISSING WHAT WAS LACKING THEY CONTINUE. TO HOLD THE FUNDS STICK TO THEIR DETERMINATION. THE MEASURES IN THIS BILL TO ME -- WOULD HELP. FOR THESE ALL TOO COMMON STORIES AND JUST SET A BASELINE WHERE. THE SELLERS WOULD KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GETTING INTO AND IF THERE FUNDS ARE GOING TO BE WITH HOW THEIR ANY OTHER DRASTIC ACTION. THEY THEY SHOULD GET SPECIFIC ALLEGATIONS AND A CHANCE TO REBUT THOSE. ON FOR THOSE REASONS I AM HERE TO OFFER MY SUPPORT. AND I HOPE. REQUEST YOU'RE A VOTE THANK YOU THANK YOU MENTION NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. THE AT HOWARD ON BEHALF OF WORKING PARTNERSHIPS USA  PROUD TO BE THE SPONSOR OF THIS BILL SIMPLY HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ADDITIONAL SUPPORTERS PLEASE COME FORWARD. THERE WERE IN AWE ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA GROCERS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU [inaudible] OPPOSITION. PLEASE COME ON UP. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS ARCHER AND SHALL MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- CHARLES RIGHT SAYS HE GENERAL COUNSEL FROM AMAZON. AS SUPPORTING OUR MARKETPLACE SERVICES MS ON VERY PROUD TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT FOOT PRINT HERE IN CALIFORNIA WITH OVER THIRTY NINE THOUSAND FULL TIME EMPLOYEES AND AN ONLINE STORE THAT FACILITATES SALES FOR OVER A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZE BUSINESSES BASED HERE IN THE STATE. I'D LIKE TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER WICKS FOR MEETING WITH US EARLIER -- AND LISTENING TO OUR CONCERNS ABOUT THE PRIOR VERSION OF THE BILL -- AND WORKING WITH US THROUGH THOSE THOSE CONCERNS WE APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE'S EFFORTS TO REMOVE SOME OF THE MORE ONE SIDED PROVISIONS OF THE BILL -- TO COME UP WITH THE AMENDMENTS -- THAT WE'RE CONSIDERING TODAY. HOWEVER EVEN WITH THOSE AMENDMENTS WE MADE REMAIN OPPOSED TO THIS BILL FOR SEVERAL REASONS. FIRST AB SEVENTEEN NINETY MISSTATES THE INTENSE COMPETITION WITHIN THE RETAIL SECTOR IN THE UNITED STATES. OF THE RETAIL INDUSTRY ISN'T AMONG THE MOST COMPETITIVE AND LEAST CONCENTRATED INDUSTRIES IN THE UNITED STATES. AMAZON MAKES UP LESS THAN 4% OF RETAIL IN THE U. S. -- WHAT MOST PEOPLE REALIZE IS APPROX WE 90% OF ALL RETAIL SALES ARE STILL CONDUCTED OFFLINE IN BRICK AND MORTAR STORES -- IN SO -- TALK OF AMAZON'S DOMINANCE MISSTATES THIS FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPT OF COMPETITION WITHIN THE RETAIL SECTOR. MANY OF OUR COME OUR COMPETITORS ALSO BEGUN PROVIDING MARKETPLACE SERVICES. AND SELLERS NOW HAVE MORE OPPORTUNITIES TO REACH THAN EVER TO REACH CONSUMERS. SINCE AMAZON NINE INVITED SO IS INTO OUR STORE IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE WALMART JET DOT COM GOOGLE SHOPPING ALI BABA RACKET TEN FACEBOOK WAYFAIR WISH AT SEA. AND MOST RECENT TARTAN WAS RECENTLY TARGET IN INSTAGRAM HAVE ALL BEGUN OFFERING MARKETPLACE SERVICES TO SELLERS -- YET THIS BILL SINGLES OUT ONE COMPANY AMAZON -- IN ITS FINDINGS IN AS THE TESTIMONY WE JUST HEARD SHOWS. WE INVEST HEAVILY IN ARE SELLING PARTNER SUCCESS BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THEY HAVE OTHER OPTIONS TO THESE OTHER MARKETPLACES WE KNOW THAT IF WE DO NOT PROVIDE THEM A GOOD SELLING EXPERIENCE ON THEY WILL GO ELSEWHERE. SECOND AB SEVENTEEN NINETY MISTAKENLY ASSUMES THAT AMAZON IS HINDERING INNOVATION AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR SELLING PARTNERS. NOTHING COULD BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH. WE WILLINGLY SPEND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS EACH YEAR TO HELP SELL OR SUCCEED BY DRIVING TRAFFIC TO OUR STORE OPERATING THE SERVERS IN INFRASTRUCTURE -- THAT KEEP OUR ONLINE STORES OPEN AT ALL TIMES AND COMBATING FRAUD AND ABUSE WE DO THIS BECAUSE AMAZON SUCCEEDS WHEN OUR SELLING PARTNER SUCCEED. SELLERS USING OUR MARKETPLACE SERVICES DELIGHT OUR CUSTOMERS EVERY DAY BY PROVIDING A VAST SELECTION CONVENIENT DELIVERY AND LOW PRICES. AS A RESULT WE HAVE EVERY INCENTIVE TO HELP OUR SELLING PARTNER SUCCEED. ARE INVESTORS ARE INVESTMENTS ALLOW SELLERS TO FOCUSON THEIR PRODUCTS FAR REACHING CUSTOMERS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. LEVELING THE PLAYING FIELD AND LOWERING ENTRY BARRIERS FOR CALIFORNIA ENTREPRENEURS. THOSE INVESTMENTS ARE UNQUESTIONABLY PROMOTING OUR BUSINESS ARE SELLING PARTNER SUCCESS. INDEPENDENT SELLERS NOW ACCOUNT FOR MORE THAN 58% OF THE PHYSICAL ITEM SOLD THROUGH OUR STORES. AND OUR SALES IN FACT GROWING FASTER THAN AMAZON RETAILS OWN SALES. NOW IT'S TRUE THAT WE DO SOMETIMES SUSPEND SELLERS AND WE DO SOMETIMES WITH OLDER FUNDS. BUT WE ONLY DO SO IN THE SMALLEST PERCENTAGE OF CASES WHERE WE SUSPECT THAT THE THAT THEY ARE COMMITTING FRAUD. WITH THE SALE IS A PRODUCT -- IT INVOLVES A COUNTERFEIT GOOD. BAD ACTORS ARE CONSTANTLY EVOLVING THEIR ABUSES OF US OUR CUSTOMERS AND OUR SELLING PARTNERS. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN ALONE WE SPENT OVER FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS COMBATING THIS FRAUD AND ABUSE AND WE BLOCK MORE THAN THREE BILLION LISTINGS FROM APPEARING. IN OUR STORES FROM BAD ACTORS BEFORE ANY CUSTOMERS EVER SAW THEM. WELL WE ACCESS WITH WE PROTECT TO PROTECT OUR CUSTOMERS FROM TO BE FAIR TO ARE SELLING PARTNERS. WHO WE KNOW HAVE BILLS TO PAY PAY ROLLS TO MEET AND OBLIGATIONS TO THEIR SUPPLIERS? WE TRIVE FOR CLARITY IN A POLICIES IN COMMUNICATION SO THAT SO IS NO WHAT IS PROHIBITED. AND HOW TO FIX ANY VIOLATIONS THAT MAY OCCUR. EVEN AS AMENDED AB SEVENTEEN NINETY STILL PAINTS A MISLEADING PICTURE OF OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR SELLING PARTNERS THAT WE LIVE WITH EVERY DAY. AS A RESULT WE REMAIN OPPOSED TO THIS BILL AND REQUEST YOUR NAY VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WITNESS PLEASE MR TURN MEMBERS COURTNEY JOHNSON WITH TECH THAT -- WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH US AND THE AMENDMENTS IN THE ANALYSIS -- IN PARTICULAR THE A KNOWLEDGE MEANT THAT MARKET PLACES THAT ALL MARKET PLACES WHETHER PHYSICAL OR ONLINE BE TREATED THE SAME AS YOU HEARD 90% OF RETAIL PURCHASES IN THE UNITED STATES STILL OCCUR IN PHYSICAL STORES. AND RELATIONSHIPS WITH MARKETPLACE SELLERS ARE NOT UNIQUE TO THE ONLINE IN COMMERCE MARKET PLACE SPACE -- SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR WE REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THIS BILL I'M YOU KNOW IT COMES AT IT FROM AN ANGLE THAT BELIEVES AND AND RECOGNIZES THAT MARKET PLACES SUCCEED ONE SELLER SUCCEED. AND WE PROVIDE SUPPORT TO OUR SELLERS IN ORDER FOR THAT TO HAPPEN AND MARKET PLACES OPEN UP A WHOLE NEW CONSUMER BASE TO SELLERS WHICH LEVELS THE PLAYING FIELD AND LOWERS ENTRY BARRIERS -- AGAIN WE APPRECIATE THE WORK OF THIS ACT COMMITTEE AND THE AUTHOR AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU AS MOVE FORWARD. THANKS VERY MUCH ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION. KEVIN KELLY WITH INTERNET ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU THANK YOU NEXT PLEASE. SERVER WITH CAL CHAMBER IN OPPOSITION OF THIS TIME. THANK YOU NEXT PLACE. KELLY IT WOULD COME TO YOU IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU THANK YOU NEXT PLACE. I APOLOGIZE CHAIRED MEMBERS I MISSED MY OPPORTUNITY TO EXPRESS OUR SUPPORT SO TOC W. WESTERN STATES COUNCIL IN SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION OR SUPPORT. SEEN A LET'S SEPARATE BACK TO COMMITTEE QUESTION MISS POWER CAN GO AHEAD PLEASE [inaudible] SO. YEAH THE BILL OPENS OF LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS -- I A TAKE I AM CONCERNED. THAT -- I MEAN IT HAS FINDING SUCH AS BY SOME ESTIMATES WHICH IS A VAGUE STATEMENT ONE COMPANY WILL CAPTURE MORE THAN 50% OF YOU COMMERCE RETAIL. NEXT ONE TALKS ABOUT THE CRITICAL CHALLENGES AND JZ COMMERCE MARKET BEING TRANSPARENCY. I GUESS I HAVE A HARD TIME VOTING FOR THOSE. FINDINGS THAT ANY EVIDENCE IS THAT MY READING THIS CORRECTLY I'M HAPPY TO AMEND OUT DOES THE SENTENCE BY SOME ESTIMATES ONE COMPANY WILL CAPTURE MORE THAN MARKETS. BY THE END OF TWENTY NINETEEN OKAY -- OKAY. AND THEN. WHAT ABOUT THE CRITICAL CHALLENGES IN TODAY'S E. COMMERCE MARKET IS TRANSPARENCY I GUESS I DON'T HAVE ANY EVIDENCE THAT THAT'S TRUE SO MAKING OUT FINDING IS CHALLENGING FOR ME? YEAH I AM HAPPY TO OKAY AT THAT -- AMEND THAT OUT -- AND I HOPE I MEAN SOME OF WHAT I WAS HEARING FROM THE OPPOSITION WAS. I WAS READING. MY INTERPRETATION IS THAT WAS FROM THE LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS IS THAT RIGHT TO AND CLARIFY YES MISTER. I WHO ARE CAN WE HAVE BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT THE FINDINGS THAT YES -- I DON'T THINK THOSE ARE THE ONLY TWO FINDINGS -- THAT WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT -- SPECIFICALLY THE FIRST FINDING IN SUCH SUBSECTION A THAT WOULD SAY THAT YOU COMMERCE RETAIL COMPANIES. HAVE AN ANSWER ON THE GLASSES SUCH AS ATTENTIVE AS CHAIR OF ONLINE SALES. AGAIN THAT DOESN'T REFLECT THE TRUE STATE OF COMPETITION WITHIN AMERICAN REACH WHAT WOULD HOW DO WE DEFINE EACH COMMERCE RETAIL COMPANIES I GUESS WOULD BE MY QUESTION. I MEAN I GUESS MY DIVISION THAT IS ANYONE WHO SELLS ON THE INTERNET SO I GUESS THEY WOULD HAVE THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR RETAIL SALES BUT YOUR POINT I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE DEFINITION OF E. COMMERCE RETAIL DO YOU HAVE A DEFINITION. THE SPECS -- WE DO -- THE WELL WE'VE DEFINED MARKETPLACE SELLER -- AS A PERSON WHO HAS AN AGREEMENT WITH THE MARKET PLACE MAKES RETAIL SALES OF TANGIBLE PERSONAL PROPERTY OR SERVICES THROUGH MARKETPLACE OWNED OPERATED OR CONTROLLED BY MARKET PLACE. AND I ALSO JUST WANT TO CLARIFY -- THIS BILLS FOR ALL. ONLINE MARKETPLACES NOT IT'S IT WOULD -- YES I AM ICE ON AND AS WELL AS EBAY AND ANYONE ELSE WHO SO I UNDERSTAND THAT MY CONCERN ACTION AT THE FINDING IN A AS TO THE SECOND WHICH YOU ALREADY AGREED TO STRIKE WAS. THAT WE COULD BE WEIGHING INTO ANTI TRUST ISSUES OF FOR MAKING ABOUT FINDING AS A BODY AND THAT CONCERNS ME WITHOUT ANY EVIDENCE -- BUT NO SO HE SAID THE QUESTION OF YOU COMMERCE RETAIL COMPANIES AND SECTION A IS THAT DEFINED. NO IT'S NOT BUT I'M IT WITH REGARD TO THE THE FINDINGS I'M HAVING TO WORK WITH YOU AND TO SAY LIKE WHATEVER THINGS YOU'RE UNCOMFORTABLE WITH OKAY I'M. OKAY SO ALL. WITH THAT FOR THAT SECTION ONE SECTION ONE WITH THAT -- THE LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS -- I'M DEFINITELY WITH HOLDING MY VOTE MOVING FORWARD AND I WANNA BE CLEAR ON THE RECORD THAT I AM NOT IN ANYWAY VOTING TO SUPPORT ANY OF THESE LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS TODAY -- AND THEN I WOULD ASK THE OPPOSITION M.. SECTION TWO WHICH DEALS REALLY WITH THE MEAT OF WHAT I THINK THIS BILL IS INTENDED TO GET AT AND SO THAT'S WHY I'M SORT OF HESITANT ON SECTION ONE WHICH I THINK HAS SOME REALLY PROBLEMATIC ELEMENTS. BUT ON SECTION TWO I'D BE I'D BE CURIOUS TO KNOW WHAT YOUR ISSUES WITH THAT ARE IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S REALLY ASKING FOR SOME VERY REASONABLE THINGS AND I AM CURIOUS AS TO WHAT YOUR OPPOSITION ON THOSE DISCLOSURES WOULD BE SPECIFICALLY. MISS MISTER CHAIRMAN OF SELLING AYE AYE PRIMARY CONCERNS WITH THE FINDINGS TO THIS BILL AS WRITTEN. AND WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE SUBSTANTIVE PROVISIONS ARE NECESSARY -- THESE ARE THINGS WE DO TODAY -- BUT OUR PRIMARY OPPOSITION IS BASED ON THESE FINDINGS WE CAN STRIKE ALL THE FINDINGS. BUT KEEP ALL OF SECTION. TWO OKAY THANK YOU MISTER X.. YES MISS SMITH GO AHEAD. AND I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S ACCEPTANCE ABOUT ACCOMMODATIONS WERE LITERALLY MY SAME CONCERNS OF MY COLLEAGUES AS SHARED AND I APPRECIATE THAT AND AND SO I DO PLAN TO SUPPORT. TODAY NOT WITHSTANDING IF IT ENDED UP ON THE FLOOR WAS SOMETHING THAT I WAS EQUALLY UNCOMFORTABLE OF COURSE I'LL LET YOU KNOW THANK YOU. MR OBERNOLTE. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I THINK THAT YOU'RE GETTING OUT SOME EXCELLENT. SOME EXCELLENT -- NEEDED LEGISLATION IN THIS BILL. I HAD A QUESTION THOUGH ABOUT THE WAY THAT YOU DEFINE MARKET PLACE SO YOU'RE DEFINING IT. TO BE ANY MARKET PLACE THE CHIPS INTO THE STATE REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT. THAT MARKET PLACE HAS A PHYSICAL PRESENCE IN THE STATE AND I WONDERED IF THAT WASN'T SETTING US UP FOR PRE EMPTION UNDER THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONS INTERSTATE COMMERCE CLAUSE BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN HAVING A FIGHT OBVIOUSLY FOR YEARS OVER -- THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF INCOME TAX COLLECTION WITH A SIMILAR DEFINITION OF MARKET PLACE AND JUST RECENTLY WE GOT A SUPREME COURT RULING THAT ALLOWED US TO CLARIFY THAT SITUATION BUT IT SEEMS LIKE. THIS KIND OF REGULATION IS A LOT MORE TENUOUS WHEN IT COMES -- TO TO THE INTERSTATE COMMERCE CLAUSE AND SO I WONDERED IF THAT WAS SOMETHING YOU THOUGHT ABOUT. AT MEASURE FOR TO MY WITNESS HER FOR THE CHAIR -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER THE DEFINITION OF MARKET PLACE THAT APPEARS IN THIS BILL -- I BELIEVE IT IS TAKEN. FOR WERE YOU CAME FROM THE COMMITTEE AND I THINK RIGHTLY SO I DO BELIEVE IT'S TAKEN WORD FOR WORD FROM CURRENT LAW. SPECIFICALLY AB ONE FORTY SEVEN WHICH WAS THE STATUTE THAT I BELIEVE WAS SIGNED THIS YEAR THAT WAS SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED. TO CODIFY -- THE TAXATION ISSUE IN THE WAKE OF THE SOUTH DAKOTA -- DECISIONS SO THIS COMES I THINK VERBATIM WORD FOR WORD FROM SIX OH FOUR ONE A OF THE REVENUE AND TAXATION OKAY SURE BUT I MEAN IF YOU READ THE SUPREME COURT DECISION -- IN THAT CASE. WHAT WHAT THEY WERE DEBATING ABOUT WAS YOU KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THE PUBLIC GOOD? OUTWEIGHED THE FEDERAL PREEMPTION THAT WAS GOING ON AND SO YOU KNOW THE DECIDED FINALLY IN THIS WAS AFTER DECADES OF ARGUING ABOUT. THAT IN THE CASE OF SALES TAX COLLECTIONS THAT DID BUT THIS SEEMS A LOT BROADER THAN SALES TAX COLLECTIONS SO I GUESS WHAT I'M SAYING IS I I'M I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT TODAY -- I I'M I'M JUST GOING TO GUESS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A PRE EMPTION ISSUE WITH THAT IF THIS BECOMES LAW. AND MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT. YOU MIGHT SAVE TIME AND AN AGGRAVATION A LOOK INTO THAT NOW IN A RATHER THAN HAVING IT LITIGATED SOMEONE IF I MAY THROUGH THE CHAIR WHAT WHAT. YOU WHAT I WILL DO. IS GO BACK AND TAKE A HARD LOOK AT THE LEGAL ANALYSIS THAT WENT INTO CRAFTING -- THAT BILL BUT I THINK THAT THE COMMITTEE CORRECTLY WANTED TO HAVE. A DEFINITION HERE -- TO TO ROUND OUT -- THE BILL AND I THINK THEY THEY TOOK THE LATEST WORD ON IT BUT I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT WITH IT'S ALWAYS WORTH IT. ALL RIGHT BACK ESPECIALLY SEE IF THERE'S ANY CASES OF INSIDE IN THE MEANWHILE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IF THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. GALLAGHER THAT YOU HAVE A QUICKER YES I AM. YOU KNOW I AS I THINK WE COULD WE CAN ARE IN NEW TERRITORY HERE. EIGHT BUT THERE'S SIMILAR PRINCIPLES -- TO WHEN WE WHEN WE HAVE BATTLED OVER ANTI ADDRESS A MONOPOLY ISSUES -- YOU IN THE PAST -- YEAH IF YOU LIKE IN BACK INTO THE AGE OF THE RAIL ROAD WHERE. NOW THAT WAS REALLY A GOVERNMENT GIVEN MONOPOLY -- IN MANY WAYS -- BUT THERE WAS ALSO MARKET PLACE THAT WAS CREATED OUT OF IT THAT EVERYBODY HAD TO UTILIZE AND EVERYBODY WAS UTILIZING THOSE RAILS ESSENTIALLY. AND WE GOT INTO A PLACE WHERE BECAUSE THEY HAD BECOME. SO POWERFUL THEY COULD USE THAT. IN WAYS THAT -- WE'RE VERY DAMAGING. TO PEOPLE TRYING TO USE. WHAT AT THAT TIME WAS -- THE THE MAIN. CHANNELS OF COMMERCE -- THIS IS DIFFERENT YOU KNOW IN THE SENSE THAT NOBODY GAVE AMAZON A A GOVERNMENT MONOPOLY -- WE DIDN'T SALE. NODE BESTOW THAT UPON YOU I MEAN THIS WAS A VERY INNOVATIVE BUSINESS IDEAL THAT IS JUST CAUGHT LIKE WILDFIRE AND AND AND AND ADMITTEDLY HAS LED TO NEO. A VERY CONVENIENT WAY. TO ACCESS GOODS AND SERVICES -- BUT YOU KNOW ULTIMATELY HAT AND AND AND I WOULD SAY IN MANY WAYS MAYBE IS LEAD TO LOWER PRICES. RIGHT BE ABLE TO ACCESS THINGS AT LOWER PRICES -- BUT IS ALSO IT'S BECOME KIND OF A MAIN HUB OF COMMERCE. IN THE SAME WAY THAT IT YOU KNOW. UPWARDS OF VIA. MY BELIEVE THE CONTENT WAS 5260%. OF THE E. COMMERCE MARKET AT THIS POINT IN TIME -- AND AND IN SUCH A WAY AS WE HAVE SEEN ISSUES WITH. IT MAKES IT HARD FOR SMALLER MOM AND POP BUSINESSES -- TO TO COMPETE OR ORDER BASICALLY HAVE TO USE THOSE. THOSE CHANNELS -- AND PAY ASSOCIATED FEES IN ORDER -- TO TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT AND THAT COMMERCE -- SO. YOU KNOW LOOK AT THE ISSUE HERE IS ONE THAT WE DO HAVE TO TO TRY AND ADDRESS NOW WE NEED TO DO IT IN A WAY -- ULTIMATELY THAT. HAD THAT IS WORK ONE IT SOUNDS LIKE WE'RE ALREADY WERE ALREADY KIND OF MAKING PROGRESS ON ON THAT FRONT -- BUT I AM CONCERNED YOU KNOW THAT AS YOU KNOW THIS. YOU AS ONE COMPANY HAS BECOME. MORE MORE IN IN A C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; AS A&lt;/c&gt;</u> MONOPOLY POSITION WE PUT IT THAT WAY -- THAT IT COULD HAVE A LOT OF NEGATIVE IMPACT IN THIS IS THING THOUGH. AS MUCH AS YOU KNOW. I THINK WE AS REPUBLICANS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN CONCERNED CERTAINLY ABOUT GOVERNMENT REGULATION. CAN STIFLE COMPETITION -- WEEKLY IN THE PAST TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT -- THE CONGLOMERATION OF POWER IN ONE COMPANY -- THAT COULD ALSO STIFLE COMPETITION AND ULTIMATELY INNOVATION. SO AND THIS IS WHY I'M SUPPORT OF THIS BILL TODAY WANT TO CONTINUE TO WORK YOU KNOW -- YOU KNOW WITH THE AUTHOR -- BUT ULTIMATELY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO YOU KNOW A FAIR MARKET PLACE FOR PEOPLE. TO TO TO WORK ON THOSE CHANNELS NOTE TO MARKET THEIR GOODS THROUGH THOSE CHANNELS OF COMMERCE SAID OBVIOUSLY HAVE CHANGED OVER TIME AND THEY WILL CONTINUE. TO CHANGE OVER TIME AND THAT'S WHY GOVERNMENT WILL HAVE TO CONTINUE THEY RESPOND TO ENSURE. THAT THAT FAIR MARKET PLACE IS A CURRENT SO THAT WHETHER YOU'RE BIG. ARE YOUR SMALL WE STILL HAVE THAT EQUAL PLAYING FIELD. TO GO OUT THERE AND MARKET OUR GOODS. TO RESPOND TO THE CHECK. UPS OKAY JUST BRIEFLY PLACES SANTIAGO. TRY TO ADDRESS YOUR CONCERN -- AT AMAZON DOES OPERATE A MARKETPLACE BUT WE'RE CERTAINLY NOT THE ONLY -- ONLINE RETAILER THAT OPERATES A MARKETPLACE WALMART OPERATES A MARKETPLACE A GOOGLE OPERATES A MARKETPLACE OF COURSE EBAY HAS BEEN AROUND SINCE BEFORE WE HAVE BEEN THERE BEEN INCREASING NUMBERS OF ENTRANTS INTO THIS SPACE. JUST IN THE LAST FEW YEARS SO TO SUGGEST. THAT AMAZON SOMEHOW OPERATES OR ENJOYS A MONOPOLY POSITION -- IS RESPECTFULLY NOT CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WE'RE SEEING BECAUSE WE HAVE TO FIGHT EVERY DAY TO ENSURE THE TRUST OF THE SELLERS AND WE DO. SO WITH A TAKE YOUR CONCERN -- BUT I THINK THE MARKET IS IN FACT -- RUNNING THOSE BY PROVIDING SELLERS WITH OTHER OPTIONS. AND WE'RE PROUD OF THE FACT THAT WE ENABLE SMALL MEDIUM SIZE BUSINESSES TO OVERCOME THEIR LOCAL BEERS TO ENTRY AND REACH HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF CUSTOMERS WORLDWIDE. THROUGH OUR SERVICES -- JUST -- AND BE ABLE TO FOCUS ON THEIR PRODUCTS AND WHAT THEY'RE ABLE TO SELL AND VERY QUICKLY REACH A WORLDWIDE AUDIENCE. AND THAT'S WHY I WAS CAREFUL TO SAY YOU KNOW I SAID BECAUSE I MONOPOLY AT AND HIM YOU KNOW NEW NEW TERRITORY RIGHT -- BUT MY POINT BEING THAT THE ECONOMIST WORLD IS SORT OF THE WAY THAT WE NOW. MOVE GOODS AND SERVICES-- AND YOUR COMPANY AND IN LARGE PART BECAUSE IT WAS INNOVATIVE IN BECAUSE IT'S SO GOOD AT CUSTOMER SERVICE RIGHT BECAUSE YOU HAVE. GONE YOU KNOW GONE TO THOSE LINKS -- TO ENSURE THAT THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE IS A GOOD. ONE RIGHT -- HAS BECOME SORT OF YOU KNOW HAS A VERY LARGE CORNER ON THE MARKET. RIGHT -- AND ALL THESE OTHER SMALL BUSINESSES OUT THERE ARE. KIND OF FEELING LIKE THEY HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO PLAY ON YOUR CHANNELS. DOES THAT MAKE SENSE AND I I ADMIT IT'S NOT IT'S NOT THE SAME OF WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE PAST RIGHT IT'S NEW -- AND THAT'S WHY I'M SAYING. YOU KNOW I'M NOT. I'M NOT SAYING THAT YOU ARE A MONOPOLY TODAY YOU KNOW -- BUT I'M SAYING THOUGH THERE THERE DOES HAVE TO BE THE CONCERN THAN ON THE BEHALF OF GOVERNMENT TO ENSURE. THAT BECAUSE OF THAT SITUATION THERE'S A FAIR MARKET PLACE IN THE LONG TERM IN THE CONTINUE BE WARY OF THAT THAT'S AND THAT'S WHY I THINK THERE'S A PLACE FOR US TO BE HAVING THESE CONVERSATIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHAIR OF FATHER AND NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS I WANT. TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THE BILL FORD AYE AYES I WILL BE SUPPORTING IT BECAUSE I THINK THAT IT TO PROVIDE TO YOU FOR A FRAMEWORK A FINE FRAMEWORK TO A TO BEGIN A DIALOGUE AT ITS I THINK YOU KNOW -- THERE MAY BE AREAS THAT WE NEED TO KIND OF FINE TUNE AS WELL. OBVIOUSLY -- THE THE COLLISION AND FINDING SO SECTION PROBABLY NEED CITY -- CORRECTED I MEAN I TO REFLECT DE ACCURATE THE INFORMATION I THINK I DON'T WANT TO YOU KNOW PROVIDE ANY IN IN IN -- INADEQUATE OR OR INCORRECT INFORMATION I MEAN THAT'S IMPORTANT AND IF I HEARD YOU CORRECTLY YOU YOU'RE STRIKING PART OF IT OR HE'S TRACKING THE ENTIRE. STRING ALL THE CHECK ALL OF ITS TWO SAYS IT WILL BE REFLECTED IN THE AMENDMENTS. AND A TRUE FREE TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE FOLKS TO SEE WHAT WHAT THE WHAT BEST FREE FALL OF AN ALL OF YOU GUYS AND AND I THINK IT WAS A REFERENCE TO AMAZON BEING STILL MENTION IN THE BILL I THINK THAT HAS BEEN DELETED. YOU KNOW EVEN THE CURRENT VERSION HAS TO LEAD THAT REFERENCE -- AND AND SO SO THAT WILL BE THE THE UNDERSTANDING. SO WITHOUT DOUBT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. ASSURE THANK YOU ALL FOR THE CONVERSATION AB SEVENTY NINETY AS PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED AND WITH THE SUGGESTIONS FROM TODAY AS WELL. SIMPLY REQUIRES THE RULES OF ENGAGEMENT BE AVAILABLE TO SMALL BUSINESSES THAT USE YOU COMMERCE MARKET PLACE -- PLATFORMS REALLY IN IN PLAIN AND SIMPLE TERMS AND PROVIDES MORE TRANSPARENCY -- AND AGAIN IT WOULD APPLY TO ALL ECOMMERCE -- MARKET PLACES AND I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THE MOTION IS TO PASS. AS AMENDED TO THE FLOOR -- MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE WALL SAU HI SO I KILEY. BAUER-KAHAN. BAUER-KAHAN I BERMAN. CALDERON. CALDERON I GABRIEL [inaudible] GALLAGHER. GALLAGHER I WENT [inaudible] OBERNOLTE. OBERNOLTE I SMITH. SMITH I WICKS I LOOKS. YES SEVEN VOTES THE BILL IS OUT CONGRATS. THAT BRINGS US TO MISTER MAY SPILL. MR MAYS HAS ITEM NUMBER TWO THAT'S AB -- TEN THIRTY FIVE WELCOME MR MACE -- ANYTIME YOU'RE READY YOU YOU MAY PROCEED. WELL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS -- I HAVE ENJOYED THE GOOD DISCUSSION AND DEBATE I THINK IT'S HEALTHY FOR US HERE IN THE IN THIS IN THIS BODY THAT TO HAVE. THAT TYPE OF DISCUSSION AND DEBATE -- TODAY I'M PROUD TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL. AT TEN THIRTY FIVE WHICH SEEKS TO STRENGTHEN NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS IN THE EVENT OF DATA BREACHES IN THE PERSONAL INFORMATION OF CALIFORNIANS. AS TECHNOLOGY CONTINUES TO INNOVATE THROUGHOUT THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR LAWS ADJUSTABLE BAD ACTORS ACCOUNTABLE FOR PLAYING FAST AND LOOSE. WITH OUR CONSTITUENTS PERSONAL DATA. A NEW STORIES FROM -- FROM INDUSTRY ARE BUDGET WITH ERRORS AND A FAILURE TO SELF REGULATE. LAST YEAR THIS LEGISLATURE IN THIS COMMITTEE UNDER YOUR LEADERSHIP MISTER CHAIR PASSED THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT PROVIDE LANDMARK REFORMS. TO HOW BUSINESSES ARE REQUIRED TO MANAGE DATA IN THE DIGITAL AGE AS YOU PREPARE FOR THAT LAW TO BECOME EFFECTIVE NEXT YEAR AND NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS ARE JUST ONE PIECE. OF THE OVERALL PUZZLE. THIS MEASURE SEEKS TO IMPLEMENT A HARD CAP AT FORTY FIVE DAYS UNLESS LEGITIMATE NEEDS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT REQUIRE ADDITIONAL TIME TO TRACK DOWN THE PERPETRATOR. AS INTRODUCED THIS MEASURE WOULD HAVE REQUIRED REPORTING TO BE DONE WITHIN SEVENTY TWO HOURS SIMILAR TO EUROPE. G. P. R. WHICH REQUIRES IS BUSINESS TO NOTIFY REGULATORS WITHIN THREE DAYS HOWEVER CALIFORNIA REQUIRES NOTIFYING ALL AFFECTED CALIFORNIANS RATHER THAN JUST REGULATORS. I'VE MET WITH NUMEROUS STAKEHOLDERS AND AGREED TO EXTEND THE HARD CAP OUT TO FORTY FIVE DAYS. THIS STRIKES A BALANCE OF WORK ABILITY BUT ALSO PROVIDES A STRINGENT CAP RATHER THAN ALLOWING FOR BREACHES TO BE HIDDEN FROM PUBLIC SCRUTINY. FOR MONTHS ON END. I ALSO WANT TO NOTE THAT EXCEPT THE SUGGEST A COMMUNITY MMS REMOVE THE REFERENCE TO THE N. I. S. T. STANDARDS ARE PART OF RECENT AUTHORS AMENDMENTS. I PLEDGE TO CONTINUE WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS IN THIS COMMITTEE TO IMPROVE OUR DATA BREACH LAWS IN A MANNER THAT HOLDS BUSINESSES ACCOUNTABLE. BUT ALSO PROVIDES CLARITY AND RELIEF WHEN THEY'RE ACTING PRUDENTLY BUT SUFFER AN ATTACK FROM A MALICIOUS ACTOR. WITH BIG DATA COMES BIG RESPONSIBILITY WE CANNOT ALLOW FOR DATA BREACHES BIG NORD WHEN THEY AFFECT MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIA'S PERSONAL INFORMATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WHEN THIS IS IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL PLEASE COME FORWARD [inaudible] OPPOSITION. IN BETWEEN. WINNERS. SEVEN MEMBERS GORDON GENSET TECH THAT -- ONE APPRECIATE -- AT THE APPROVED WE APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHOR AND STAFF -- IN THE HARD WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE AND THE OPEN DOOR THROUGHOUT THIS ENTIRE PROCESS SO JUST WANTED TO SAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU MUCH PLEASE BEGIN GOOD AFTERNOON WELCOME TIMOTHY BLOOD ON BEHALF OF CONSUMER TREES OF CALIFORNIA A WE OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED. I'M OUR ISSUE IS WITH THE TIME FRAME -- WITHIN FORTY FIVE DAYS IS TOO LONG -- OF COURSE THE PURPOSE OF THE NOTIFICATION -- PROVISION IS TO NOTIFY CONSUMERS SO THEY CAN PROBABLY TAKE ACTION TO PROTECT THEMSELVES AGAINST IDENTITY THEFT. OR IF IDENTITY THEFT IS ALREADY OCCURRED TO MITIGATE THE CONSEQUENCES OF THAT IDENTITY THEFT. UP. TODAY WE CAN NOTIFY PEOPLE FASTER -- AND AT A LOWER COST THAN WE COULD TEN YEARS AGO AND OF COURSE THAT THAT IS GOING TO CONTINUE. AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN TIME ALSO DATA THIEVES ARE ABLE TO STEAL DATA FASTER THAN THEY COULD TEN YEARS AGO AND THAT IS ALSO GOING TO CONTINUE AS WE GO FORWARD. SO IT IT BECOMES A DIFFICULT TRICK IN PICKING A A TIME PERIOD. INSTITUTIONALIZING A TIME PERIOD THAT IS ACTUALLY GOING TO WORK -- AS TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES UP WITHIN FORTY FIVE DAYS IS TOO LONG. UNDER TODAY'S CIRCUMSTANCES AND CERTAINLY WILL BE TOO LONG INTO THE FUTURE -- WE THINK THAT A BETTER MODEL IS THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF MEDICAL PRIVACY ACT. THAT PROVIDES THAT REQUIRES NOTIFICATION WITHIN FIFTEEN BUSINESS DAYS AS A CURRENT CALIFORNIA LAW THAT IS PLACED ON HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS WHERE INFORMATION. ABOUT MEDICAL INFORMATION IS TAKEN ON PATIENTS REQUIRES HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS TO PROVIDE NOTIFICATION WITHIN FIFTEEN BUSINESS DAYS. THAT HAS WORKED PERFECTLY FINE -- THERE'S WE DON'T BELIEVE ANY REASON WHY IT WOULD NOT WORK FINE HERE ALSO THERE ARE OTHER STATES IN THE UNITED STATES THAT HAVE NOTIFICATION PROVISIONS. SIMILAR TO CALIFORNIA'S -- THOSE STATES ARE ARE AS LOW AS THIRTY DAYS AND AGAIN. THERE'S NO PROBLEM THAT THESE OTHER STATES HAVE IN COMPLYING WITH THOSE TIME PERIODS AND SO WE THINK FIFTEEN BUSINESS DAYS WOULD BE SUFFICIENT. AND SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE EVEN LESS TIME THAN THAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- NEXT PLEASE. SMITH THE COURT ON BEHALF OF PRIVACY RIGHTS CLEARING HOUSE WE WOULD LOVE TO BE IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE HOWEVER WOULD AFFILIATE MY COMMENTS WITH THOSE OF THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS WE DO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT. THE FORTY FIVE DAY DURATION HAPPY TO CHAT WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE FURTHER WE'VE ACTUALLY JUST COMPLETED A STATE BY STATE ANALYSIS OF THESE PROVISIONS AND OTHER STATES -- THANK YOU. THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH SARAH BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. BUT SEVEN GUY QUESTION. MISBACH. WELL IT SEEMS LIKE IT FROM ALL SIDES YOU HAVE IT THERE -- YEAH -- SO WHAT WE'VE HEARD SOME REALLY APPALLING STORIES ABOUT OUR DATA GETTING OUT ESPECIALLY WITH THE EQUIFAX BREACH AND AND I AGREE THAT CONSUMERS SHOULD BE NOTIFIED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND IT'S POSSIBLE TO DO IT IN FIFTEEN DAYS THAT WOULD BE GREAT -- I APPRECIATE THE EXEMPTION -- FOR ONGOING INVESTIGATIONS BUT WHAT WE'VE SEEN. AS WE'VE LOOKED AT AT THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN SYSTEMS THAT -- THERE MIGHT JUST BE A PROBLEM PATCHING IT THAT QUICKLY. AND YOU KNOW THE SAME IS WITH YOUR IPHONE AND THE CONCERN IS THAT IF THE SYSTEM CANNOT BE. PATCHED IN FORTY FIVE DAYS -- AND THEN YOU TELL OTHER HACKERS THAT THERE IS A BREACH THAT YOU COULD BE EXPOSING USERS DATA -- TO OF MANY HACKERS AS OPPOSED TO THE ONE THAT THAT WAS ABLE TO GET AND SO IS THERE ANY SAFE GUARD WHERE MAYBE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL COULD SAY -- YES THIS IS THIS IS LEGITIMATE THEIR THEIR SYSTEM IS STILL WIDE OPEN AND THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO PATCH IT I MEAN LIKE I SAID I WOULDN'T MIND THE FIFTEEN DAYS BUT BUT KEEPING. A VULNERABILITY OPEN IS IS TO BE A PROBLEM -- IT ABSOLUTELY CURRENT LAW -- ALLOWS FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT WHICH WOULD INCLUDE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OR ANY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY THAT HAPPENS TO BE INVESTIGATING AT TO PERMIT THE COMPANY TO TO TELL THE COMPANY DID NOT NOTIFY -- CONSUMERS AND THERE'S A COUPLE OF REASONS WHY -- ONE FORCE THAT WOULD NOT NOT WANT. CONSUMERS TO BE NOTIFIED YOUR CONCERN IS ONE OF THEM ANOTHER ONE IS SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHO THE BAD GUY IS AND THEY DON'T WANT THE BAD GUY TO KNOW THAT THEY KNOW. SO SO CURRENT LAW -- TAKES CARE OF THAT PROBLEM SO AT THE END OF LIKE IF I CAN FIX YOU LOOK AT THE LANGUAGE IS ON PAGE THREE IF YOU HAVE IT IN FRONT OF YOU -- IF YOU LOOK AT THE LINES FOURTEEN TO TWENTY WHERE IT SAYS THAT CAN CONSIST OF THE LEDGE TO THE GYM IT NEEDS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AS PROVIDED IN SUBDIVISION AND THEN IT GOES ON SO THE I THINK WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT OUT IN THE HALLWAY -- MAYBE THIS DOESN'T ADDRESS YOUR YOUR CONCERN AND I'D BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE A TWO FOOT TO ADDRESS THAT BECAUSE WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANT IF THERE IS A SMALL BREACH TO YOUR POINT WE DON'T WANT THAT BREACH TO GET MUCH. MUCH LARGER AND TO CREATE MORE OF A LIABILITY THAN THAT THAN THERE ALREADY IS AT THE SAME TIME WE DON'T WANT THE COMPANIES TO HAVE SOME EXCUSE -- FOR NOT LETTING OF FOLKS KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN A BIT BEEN A DATA BREACH AND SO WOULD BE OPEN TO THAT TO THAT CONVERSATION AT THAT'S AND AND I I ABSOLUTELY AGREE WE HAVE TO HOLD THESE COMPANIES ACCOUNTABLE I JUST. YOU JUST DON'T WANNA MAKE THE SITUATION WORSE SO IF IT'S TAKEN CARE OF BY THAT STATEMENT IS ABOUT LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THAT'S FINE OTHERWISE -- HOPEFULLY THAT'S SOMETHING YOU CAN WORK ON SURE. SO I AGREE WITH THE COMMENTS FROM MY COLLEAGUE THAT. WE WANT. THIS TO HAPPEN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE SEVENTY TWO HOURS FIFTEEN DAYS BUT IT MOST FORTY FIVE HER THAT'S HOW I READ THE LAW TO BE AS MISTER IS PROPOSING IT SAYS. THAT THE DISCLOSURE SHALL BE MADE IN THE MOST EXPEDIENT TIME POSSIBLE AND WITHOUT AND REASONABLE THE LAKE BUT IN NO CASE LONGER THAN FORTY FIVE DAYS OF COMPANY WERE TO BE FOUND. TO REFER TO BE POSSIBLE TO DISCLOSE WITHIN SEVENTY TWO HOURS OR FIFTEEN DAYS THEY WOULD BE IN VIOLATION OF THIS LAWS I READ IT. BUT AT NO FORTY FIVE AN HOUR OUTSIDE. SO I GUESS I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOUR OPPOSITION. HAVING LITIGATE THESE CASES THE THE FORTY FIVE DAY WHATEVER THE TIME WHEN IT IS. THAT'S THAT BECOMES THE INSTITUTIONALIZED DEADLINE TO COMPLY WITH NOTIFICATION STATUTES. THAT BECOMES THE NORM THAT'S WHAT COMPANIES SHOULD FOR AND THERE'S NEVER REALLY ANY INCENTIVE TO IMPROVE THAT TIME AND THEN IT BECOMES SOMETHING THAT HAS TO BE LITIGATED ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT. A COMPANY SHOULD HAVE -- COMPLIED WITH A NOTE OF CARE PROVIDED NOTIFICATION EASE EVEN EARLIER. SO. THE HAVING AN OUTSIDE DATE. GET IT IS A DOUBLE EDGED SWORD BECAUSE IT ENDS UP AS SOON AS CALIFORNIA SAYS FORTY FIVE DAYS. IT'S FORTY FIVE DAYS AND IT'S ONLY GOING TO BE REALLY IN THE EXCEPTION THAT IT'S EVER GONNA BE SHORTER THAN THAT. IN THERE AS TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES TOWARD THERE IS GOING TO REALLY BE NOTICE THAT THERE'S GONNA BE NO INCENTIVE TO SPEED THAT TIMELY FRONT TIME FRAME ALONG IT'S GOING TO BE FORTY FIVE DAYS. THEN LET'S CREATE THE LEGISLATIVE RECORD RIGHT NOW THAT WE WOULD LIKE IT TO HAPPEN IT'S EXPEDIENT WAY AS POSSIBLE AND THAT FORTY FIVE DAYS OF THE OUTSIDE YOU AGREE THAT MISTER MATH OF COURSE I DO THANK YOU. MISS WICKS GO AHEAD JUST WANNA SEE AUTHOR WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO WORK WITH THE CONSUMER TOURNEY'S TO DO MAYBE SAY FIFTEEN DAYS I'D BE HAPPY TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION AS YOU KNOW ONCE YOU START ONE CONVERSATION WITH ONE GROUP THAT THERE'S ANOTHER GROUP THAT COMES ON THE OTHER. SIDE -- WHICH IS PART OF THE THE PROCESS THAT WE HAVE HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE WHAT I WILL COMMIT TO USE CONTINUE WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE I KNOW THAT THE COMMITTEE STAFF AND ON THE CHAIR -- HAVE THAT DUG INTO THIS A BIT THERE'S BEEN MANY STAKEHOLDERS WE JUST LEARNED ABOUT -- THIS OPPOSITION ON FRIDAY I BELIEVE I'M SO WOULD LOVE TO BE TAKEN CONTINUE HAVE A CONVERSATION I START OFF WITH SEVENTY TWO HOURS -- THAT AND I'VE GONE FROM SEVENTY TWO HOURS -- TO TO TO FORTY FIVE DAYS AND IF I CAN JUST MAKE THIS POINT -- TWO I KNOW THERE'S LOTS OF CONVERSATIONS BUT I'VE -- AND I UNLIKE ASSEMBLY MEMBER TOM FROM BIG BEAR OUT OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM BIG BEAR -- WHO WANT TO CAL TECH IN UNDERSTANDS -- HOW THE CYBER WORLD WORKS I DON'T NECESSARILY I'M FULLY GRASP HOW THE CYBER WORLD WORKS HAVE TO MAKE -- IF OF TO BRING THIS TO REAL TO REAL LIFE AND THE BEST WAY THAT I'VE EXPLAINED THIS IS I USED TO DO TAXES FROM A FOR A LIVING. AND I WOULD WHEN PREPARING TAXES -- I'D HAVE A CLIENTS WOULD SEND ME THEIR INFORMATION VIA MAIL RIGHT SO SECURITY NUMBERS IN DATA PERSON THAT THE MORTGAGE HOW MANY KIDS THEY HAD ALL OF THIS INFORMATION. AND IF SOMEBODY BROKE INTO MY OFFICE. AND I SAW THAT THERE FILE BEEN TAKEN OFF THE SHELF AND WAS ON THE GROUND HOW HOW LONG DO YOU THINK I SHOULD HAVE BEFORE I'VE CALLED THAT. CLIENT TO TELL THEM THAT THEIR INFORMATION -- HAS -- IT AS BEEN -- HAS BEEN TAKEN A POSSIBLY TAKEN UP I DON'T THINK SEVENTY TWO ARE THE SEVEN TO OURS IS TOO LONG I THINK FORTY FIVE DAYS IS TOO LONG. WHEN SOME OF THE CONVERSATIONS THAT I'VE HAD WITH SOME FOLKS WITH SOME OF THE EARLIER CONVERSATIONS A CONVERSATIONS LATER OF GOTTEN MUCH BETTER WHICH WAS YEAH BUT DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND THAT IF WE TELL PEOPLE THAT THEIR? DATA IS BEEN BREACH THAT -- IT'LL AFFECT OUR BUSINESS -- IT PEOPLE WON'T TRUST OUR BUSINESS MY RESPONSE TO THAT IS WHO CARES. IF IF I HAVE THAT THERE'S LIABILITY MY INFORMATION MY MIGHT SERIOUS PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT COULD HAVE GONE ACROSS THE WORLD. AND HAS BEEN TAKEN AND COULD BE USED FOR SOME NEFARIOUS REASON WE'VE GOT TO LET PEOPLE KNOW RIGHT AWAY. AM YEAH I THINK IT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR US AS STATE GOVERNMENT TO SET SOME STANDARDS SO -- I'M COMMITTED TO THIS AND FIGURING OUT WHAT THAT TIME FRAME I MIGHT BE I'M ABOVE OPEN THE CONVERSATION BUT WITH THE COMMITTEE -- THEY WERE UNCOMFORTABLE WITH FORTY FIVE DAYS AND SO WE'VE GOT FORTY FIVE DAYS WILL CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION AS IT PROGRESSES SO ALL OF IT FOR THE BILL TODAY AND OF THE PUSH FOR SHORTER TIME FRAME AND ALIGN MYSELF WITH CONSUMER TOURNEY'S BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT CONVERSATION WANT TO KEEP. IT GOING THANK YOU SO MUCH. VERY GOOD JOB IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE G. -- HAD FORTY DAYS AS THE AVERAGE A AND IN HIS -- MOST RECENT REPORT SO SO THAT'S WHY WE FEEL COMFORT I FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH THE FORTY FIVE DAYS BUT THE I'M. DEFINITELY OPEN TO YOU YOU KNOW ON MARCH FIND OUT A LITTLE BIT TOO TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU KEEP BILL CONSENSUS -- WITH ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS TO KEEP IN THE LOOP WILLIAMS OUT HERE IF I CAN'T EVEN IF THIS BILL MOVES OUT TODAY IF WE CAN CONTINUE OUR CONVERSATION AND SEEK ADVICE AS WE AS IT MOVES THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- WITH THAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE OBVIOUSLY IF THE REQUEST AND I FELT VERY GOOD TO OUT DO I HAVE A MOTION AND IT -- THE MOTION IS TO PASS -- AS AMENDED TO THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR SO WITH THAT -- ROLL CALL PLEASE. CHAU HI. CHAO I KILEY. BAUER-KAHAN I BAUER-KAHAN I BERMAN. CALDERON. CALDERON I GABRIEL [inaudible] GALLAGHER [inaudible] IRWIN -- WHEN I OBERNOLTE OBERNOLTE AYE SMITH? SMITH I WEEKS WEEKS TIME YES SEVEN OH TWO BILLS OUT THANK YOU. AND WE'VE DONE [inaudible] ORDER. CAN I HAVE. BEEN KNOWN. TO MOST OF MISTER OBERNOLTE HERE NEXT. WHICH LIKE THE PRESENT FIRST BEFORE YOU NOW HAVE EVENT DATA RECORDERS ARE EDIE OURS THAT ARE EVERY BIT AS SOPHISTICATED AS THOSE AN AIRCRAFT. AND THAT THEY CAN STORE DATA THAT'S VERY USEFUL TO THE INVESTIGATORS OFACCIDENTS INVOLVING THOSE VEHICLES. THIS BILL IS AN EFFORT TO GIVE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ARE INVESTIGATING SERIOUS ACCIDENTS INVOLVING SERIOUS BODILY INJURY OR DEATH ACCESS TO A VERY LIMITED SUBSET OF DATA ON THESE ELECTRONIC DATA RECORDERS. AND I'M AWARE THAT WE'RE ALL WE ALL ARE PRIVACY CONCERNS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE NARROWLY TAILORED THIS DATA THAT THEY HAVE ACCESS -- TO TO MAKE SURE THAT WE PROTECT THE PRIVACY OF THE PEOPLE WHO OWN THESE VEHICLES AND SO WE TAKE AND WE WE STARTED OFF WITH A VERY CONSTRAINED. VIEW OF THE DATA THAT WAS GOING TO BE ACCESSIBLE BUT IN THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE WE WE TOOK AMENDMENTS THAT NARROW DOWN EVEN FURTHER SO. THIS WOULD BE ONLY ON OF THE IN ACCIDENTS INVOLVING SERIOUS BODILY INJURY OR DEATH -- ONLY A VERY LIMITED SUBSET OF THE DATA AVAILABLE ON THE ET ARE SO THAT WOULD BE. THINGS LIKE STEERING WHEEL POSITION AND ACCELERATOR POSITION BREAKING POSITION THE PERFORMANCE OF THE AIR BAGS WHETHER OR NOT THE SEAT BELTS WERE FAST AND THINGS LIKE THAT. ONLY TO A PERIOD FIVE MINUTES FIVE SECONDS BEFORE TO ONE SECOND AFTER THE ACCIDENT AND ONLY -- WITH A JUDGE'S CONSENT BECAUSE THEY'D HAVE TO STILL FILE FOR A WARRANT TO GET ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION SO THIS WOULD REALLY HELP. LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES -- INVESTIGATE THE CAUSES OF THESE ACCIDENTS THIS IS VALUABLE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE -- THAT I THINK THAT THEY'RE ENTITLED. TO FIRST ONE IS PLEASE THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I AM DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY JOHN PHILPOT I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION. AS WELL AS SAN DIEGO COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY SUMMER STEPHAN IN STRONG SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY BILL. SIXTEEN THIRTY EIGHT I WOULD LIKE TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER OBERNOLTE FOR OFFERING THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION. I'VE BEEN A DEPUTY DISTRICT FOR TWENTY ONE YEARS I'VE PROSECUTED MANY VEHICULAR CRIMES INCLUDING VEHICULAR MANSLAUGHTER. I ALSO WAS A CIVIL LITIGATOR FOR FIVE YEARS BEFORE COMING OF BECOMING A PROSECUTOR. AND EVENT DATA RECORDER OR EDR IS OFTEN COMPARED TO THE SO CALLED BLACK BOX IN AN AIRCRAFT THAT IS USED BY. AIRCRAFT INVESTIGATORS TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF CRASHES OF COMMERCIAL AIRLINERS IN BOTH SITUATIONS WITH EDIE OURS AND WITH A COMMERCIAL AIRLINE SITUATIONS TECHNICAL DATA PROVIDES INVESTIGATORS CRITICAL SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE. WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH THE VEHICLE OR AIRCRAFT WHEN IT CRASHED? ET OUR DATA COMES FROM VEHICLES AIRBAG DEPLOYMENT SYSTEMS AND EIGHTY OUR CAPTORS THINGS LIKE STEERING BREAKING SPEED. AND SEAT BELT USE BUT BY DESIGN THE ET ARE ONLY CAPTURES FIVE SECONDS BEFORE TWO ONE SECOND AFTER THE CRASH. PRACTICALLY SPEAKING IF THERE IS NO A VENT MEANING A CRASH THERE IS NO DATA RECORDED. A TRAINED EXPERT CAN YOU SPECIALIZED EQUIPMENT TO PLUG INTO A VEHICLE AND RETRIEVED FROM THAT VEHICLE THE ET OUR DATA. THAT DATA ALONG WITH PHYSICAL EVIDENCE AND WITNESS STATEMENTS IS USED TO DETERMINE WHAT HAPPENED IN A CRASH. IMPORTANTLY TYPICAL EDR DATA IS NOT CONSIDERED PRIVATE FROM A CONSTITUTIONAL PERSPECTIVE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THIS IS PURSUANT TO PEOPLE VERSUS D. AS A CASE OUT OF TWENTY THIRTEEN ASIDE ON THAT IS TWO THIRTEEN CALLOUT. FORTY SEVEN FORTY THREE THE REASON BEING IS THAT VEHICLE MOVEMENT SPEED AND BREAKING ARE ALL THINGS THAT ARE EXPOSED TO PUBLIC VIEW WHEN A VEHICLE IS ON A ROADWAY. SO FROM A CONSTITUTIONAL PERSPECTIVE IT IS NOT PRIVATE CERTAINLY FROM STATUTORY PERSPECTIVES IN CALIFORNIA THERE IS PRIVACY INVOLVED. NOW IMAGINE THIS SCENARIO AND THIS IS JUST ONE OF MANY THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT IS CONFRONTED WITH OFTEN. A CAR IS FOUND CRASHED INTO A BRIDGE ABUTMENT THE DRIVER IS DEAD THE DRIVER HAPPENS TO BE THE REGISTERED OWNER OF THE VEHICLE. AND THE PASSENGERS IN A COMA THERE WERE NO WITNESSES. LAW ENFORCEMENT IS PASSED BY THE VEHICLE CODE WITH CONDUCTING AN INVESTIGATION DETERMINING WHAT HAPPENED. WHAT WAS THE CAUSE WERE ANY LAWS VIOLATED? LAW ENFORCEMENT UNDER CURRENT LAW IN THAT SITUATION CANNOT COMPEL. THE EAT THE PRODUCTION OF THE E. D. R. DATA BECAUSE THAT SCENARIO DOES NOT AMOUNT TO A FELONY INVESTIGATION. AB SIXTEEN THIRTY EIGHT WILL FIX THIS PROBLEM AND THIS IS ONE OF MANY ILLUSTRATIONS. IN ADDITION TO POTENTIAL CRIMINAL CHARGES AN EXONERATION OF THE INNOCENT IMPORTANT DECISIONS ABOUT WHETHER TO FILE A CIVIL LAWSUIT AND IF SO AGAINST WHO. WHAT COMPANY OR WHAT GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY ARE MADE BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT CRASH INVESTIGATION? CIVIL LAWYERS NOTE THAT IF ET ARE IS NOT ATTAINED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT. THE CARD MAY GO TO A CRUSHER AND THE EDR DATA WILL BE LOST FOREVER. CIVIL LAWYERS ARE ALSO WELL AWARE THAT IF LAW ENFORCEMENT DID NOT. GET THE EDR DATA THEY CAN FILE A CIVIL LAWSUIT AND USE CIVIL SUBPOENAS AND CIVIL COURT ORDERS TO OBTAIN THE VERY EDR DATA. THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT CURRENTLY CANNOT OBTAIN. AB. SIXTEEN THIRTY EIGHT DOES ALLOW FOR A SEARCH WARRANT IN CASES WHERE AN INFRACTION IS THE UNDERLYING PUBLIC OFFENSE. THIS IS NOT UNIQUE A PUBLIC OFFENSE CAN BE THE BASIS FOR A SEARCH WARRANT UNDER EXISTING CALIFORNIA PENAL CODE. FIFTEEN TWENTY FOUR EIGHT THREE ADDITIONALLY VARIOUS FELONY CRIMES THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE ARE BASED ON THE HIT KILLER INFRACTION CONDUCT. SUCH AS VEHICULAR MANSLAUGHTER AND RECKLESS OF AID. AB SIXTEEN THIRTY EIGHT IS UNIQUE IT ADDRESSES AN ISOLATED LEGAL SITUATION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT FACES IT APPLIES SOLELY TO THE RARE LEGAL ANOMALY WHERE INFRACTION CONDUCT. WHICH CAUSES SOMEONE TO DEATH OR SERIOUS BODILY INJURY. NEEDS TO BE INVESTIGATED BUT THAT CONDUCT IS NOT NECESSARILY A FELLOW. AB SIXTEEN THIRTY EIGHT IS NARROWLY TAILORED TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM AT HAND. IT'S A REASONABLE BALANCE BETWEEN STATUTORY PRIVACY CONSIDERATIONS. HOW PRIVATE SENSITIVE OR PERSONAL IS THE INFORMATION VERSUS HOW IMPORTANT IS THAT INFORMATION TO LAW ENFORCEMENT INVESTIGATIONS AND WHAT SOCIETY EXPECTS FROM OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT CRASH INVESTIGATORS? AB SIXTEEN THIRTY EIGHT DOES NOT APPLY TO ALL VEHICLE CRASHES AB SIXTEEN THIRTY EIGHT DOES NOT APPLY TO CRASHES WITH ANY TYPE OF INJURY. IT IS SOLELY RELATED AND APPLIES TO ONLY THE MOST SERIOUS CRASHES THOSE RESULTING IN DEATH OR SERIOUS BODILY INJURY. I'M ASKING FOR YOUR AYE VOTE IN AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ADDITIONAL SUPPORTERS. CNN OPPOSITION PLEASE COME. FOR WELCOME. AFTERNOON MISTER TURN MEMBERS KEVIN BACON FOR THE AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OF CALIFORNIA WE ARE IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL -- ACTUALLY QUITE PERPLEXED -- BY THE BILL THE THE WITNESS IN THE AUTHOR OF BEEN DESCRIBING VEHICULAR MANSLAUGHTER IN OTHER SITUATIONS -- THESE ARE -- EXISTING FELONY CRIMES THAT FOR WHICH A SEARCH WARRANT IS OBTAINABLE -- AND IT IS NOT AT ALL CLEAR TO US WHY A SEARCH WARRANT WOULD BE -- ALLOWED FOR THE FIRST TIME. IN THESE SITUATIONS THAT DO NOT INVOLVE SERIOUS OFFENSES. THAT IS VERY CONSTITUTIONAL BALANCE IN CALIFORNIA. WE ALLOW SEARCH WARRANTS FOR AN IMPORTANT CRIMINAL OFFENSES BUT WE DO NOT. HAVE A PROVISION FOR THE ISSUANCE OF SEARCH WARRANTS IN THOSE CASES WHERE WE DO NOT HAVE A SERIOUS CRIME. SO IT'S IT WOULD BE A A NOVEL PROPOSITION DESPITE THE LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES THAT THE THAT THE AUTHOR SAYS TO WHICH THE BILL APPLIES. TO IT IS NEVERTHELESS IMPORTANT -- DEVIATION FROM EXISTING -- LEGAL SCHEME AND WE'RE OPPOSE FOR THAT REASON. THANK YOU ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION. AT THE CORNER THE ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION I APOLOGIZE TO THE AUTHOR WERE A LITTLE LATE TO THIS PARTY -- BUT WOULD LIKE TO AFFILIATE MYSELF WITH THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM A CELL YOU LOOK FOR TO CONNECTING WITH YOUR OFFICE THANK YOU. THANKS SEVEN ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION SEE NINE LET'S BRING BACK TO THE COMMUNITY QUESTIONS COMMENTS OR MISS WICKS GO AHEAD. THANK YOU THANK YOU JUST ADDRESS THE ACLU'S CONCERNED A CONCERN -- AROUND ALLOWING SEARCH WARRANTS FOR NON SERIOUS CRIMES. SO. I'LL TELL TELL YOU MY OPINION AND THEN I'D LIKE ARE WITH MY WITNESS TO WEIGH IN AS WELL BUT THERE ARE SITUATIONS WHERE LAW ENFORCEMENT IS INVESTIGATING A SERIOUS ACCIDENT. WHERE THE VEHICLE OWNERS UNABLE TO GIVE CONSENT SO THE VEHICLE OWNERS TO SEE STIR THE VEHICLE OWNER IS? FIVE IN A COMA AND CAPACITY TO AND IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES. THERE IS NOT A LEGAL MECHANISM FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO GET ACCESS TO THAT THE THE DATA ON THE U. D. R. UNLESS A FELONY HAS BEEN COMMITTED SO THOSE ARE THE THE THERE'S A LOOPHOLE WE'RE TRYING TO GO AFTER HER. NOTHING AT THE YES I I WOULD SAY THE CURRENT STATUTORY LAW. WE END UP WITH THE SITUATION OF WHAT I SEE IS ON UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE YOUR GOOD CODE -- NINE NINE FIVE ONE BASICALLY SAYS HE LAW ENFORCEMENT OR ANYBODY YOU DON'T ACCESS TO YOUR DATA WITHOUT CONSENT FOR AN ORDER OF THE COURT. THERE ARE TWO BASIC TYPES OF ORDERS OF THE COURT SUBPOENAS. WHICH ARE MUCH LESS STRINGENT AND SEARCH WARRANTS AND SEARCH WARRANTS. LAW ENFORCEMENT DOES NOT HAVE AVAILABLE TO IT AT THE INVESTIGATION STAGE A SUBPOENA IT'S NOT. SOMETHING IT'S NOT A TOOL THAT THEY HAVE IN THEIR TOOL BOX. WE ARE ASKING THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT -- GIVEN A TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX IN ORDER TO CONDUCT A PROFESSIONAL INVESTIGATION WHEN SOMEONE IS DEAD OR SERIOUSLY BOTTLE THE IN SUCH SERIOUSLY BODILY INJURY. CAN WE GET THE ACLU'S RESPONSE -- TO SOME NUMBERS TAKE ON THAT. WELL THE OTHER IS SOME SORT OF REPEATED WHAT THE BILL DOES HAVE SOME. I I DON'T I HAVEN'T HEARD -- A JUSTIFICATION FOR WHY THIS IMPORTANT DISTINCTION SHOULD NOW BE TRAVERSED FOR THE FIRST TIME. IT IN IN MANY CASES COVERED BY THE BILL CONSENT WOULD BE ATTAINABLE OBVIOUSLY WHEN THE DRIVER IS DEAD AND HE IS OR SHE IS THE ONLY PERSON THAT COULD GIVE CONSENT. THEN THAT MIGHT BE ONE LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCE BUT THAT'S NOT THE ONLY CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH TO BUILD PLIES. AND YOU VIEW THIS IS SORT OF A SLIPPERY SLOPE. YEAH OKAY I AND I I DO SURE THAT CONCERNING -- CANCER PUBLIC SAFETY I THINK I'VE STAINED THAT VOTE AND I WILL PROBABLY DO THE SAME HERE BUT MR CARTER A GO AHEAD -- IT IF IT IS YOUR COULD YOU CAN ANSWER. IN THE EVENT THAT THERE IS SOMEBODY WHO IS THE SEASON I CANNOT OBTAIN THAT INFORMATION CAN I OBTAIN THAT CONSENT HOW CAN YOU OBTAIN THAT INFORMATION. UNDER CURRENT LAW. WELL THE THERE THERE MAY BE CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE. CERTAIN INFORMATION IS NOT ALWAYS AVAILABLE. ON FOR SPENT IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES -- WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS A FAIRLY NARROW SITUATION IT IT SEEMS -- BUT IT IS NOT -- LIKELY TO BE ONE THAT ARISES OFTEN -- AND AND NOT ONE THAT WE THINK IT'S SUFFICIENT TO JUSTIFY DEPARTING FROM OUR LONG STANDING CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES. IN THE EVENT THAT WE RUN INTO A SITUATION WHERE SOMEBODY IS A SEES TO IT WOULD SEEM THAT THE LAW IS LACKING IN TERMS OF HOW YOU CAN OBTAIN THIS INFORMATION IT COULD HELP YOU DETERMINE. THE THE THE CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING THE ACCIDENT OF CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING IT WHATEVER THE SITUATION IS THAT YOU COULD MAYBE LEARN FROM BEING ABLE TO HAVE ACCESS TO THIS TYPE OF INFORMATION -- I MAY NOT NECESSARILY THOROUGHLY DISAGREE WITH YOUR ARGUMENT IN TERMS OF LONGSTANDING PRACTICE AND OPENING THIS PER PROCESS UP BUT IT SEEMS LIKE SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE COULD BE A GAP. IN GETTING GAINING ACCESS TO THIS TYPE OF INFORMATION -- ESPECIALLY IN THE EVENT THAT SOMEBODY HAS BEEN -- DECEASED SO IS BECAUSE OF THAT I'M TO BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY ALLOW YOU TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION. ON THIS BILL AND AND I'M WITH THE BILL. MISS POWER CAN. SO I TO SET ON PUBLIC SAFETY WHEN WE VOTED ON THIS -- AND YOU WEREN'T THERE SO AND ASK YOU THE QUESTION I ASKED IN THAT HEARING WHICH WAS. WILL GIVES ME COMFORT IS THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE WARRANT PROCESS ALTHOUGH I MY UNDERSTANDING OF THIS WOULD BE THAT THE STANDARD WOULD BE DIFFERENT. FOR THESE REQUESTS THAN IT THAN ANY OTHER SEARCH WARRANT IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE ARGUING. I DON'T. I DON'T KNOW THE STANDARD WOULD BE OKAY SO I GUESS IF THEY'RE HAVING TO GO THROUGH THE SEARCH WARRANT PROCESS WHICH IS THE PROCESS THAT WE MANDATE TO PROTECT ONE'S CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT I GUESS I'M CONFUSED AS TO WHAT YOUR CONCERN IS. WELL OUR AT THAT. OTHER NEED LAWYER YOURSELF -- YOU UNDERSTAND THAT CALIFORNIA'S SEARCH WARRANTS STATUTE OPERATES TO CURB GOVERNMENTAL OVER REACH AND PROTECT PRIVACY AND SO IT. HAS THIS BALANCE OF PRIVACY CONCERNS WITH -- JUDGMENT PUBLIC SAFETY CONCERNS -- BUT IT IS IT IS IT IS FOCUSED ON THOSE SERIOUS CRIMES. THAT'S THE SITUATION IN WHICH WE AUTHORIZE SEARCH WARRANTS. GOT IT BUT THE COURT WOULD STILL HAVE TO DO THAT DETERMINATION TO BALANCE THE PRIVACY INTEREST OF THE INDIVIDUAL FOR WHOM THIS DATA WAS BEING. SOUGHT AND THE NEED FOR THE DATA BUT YOU'RE ALSO OPENING UP NOW WITH THE FIELD TO SEARCH WARRANTS. TO THE WHOLE LITANY OF OTHER POTENTIAL LOW LEVEL INFRACTIONS. LOOK AT WHERE THEY DID NOT EXIST OKAY I UNDERSTAND THANK YOU. A MISTER GALLAGHER -- JUST TO QUIT BUT IT WOULD STILL HAVE TO INVOLVE A SITUATION WHERE. DEATH OR SERIOUS BODILY INJURY HAD OCCURRED CORRECT THAT'S CORRECT THAT'S THE WAY WE'VE NARROWLY TERREL TAYLOR THE BILL ONLY IN THOSE ACCIDENTS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WELL IT WOULD JUST BE BACK ON NOW THAT -- OB GRANTED THERE IS STILL THE BUFFER OF REQUIRING A SEARCH WARRANT. I THINK THAT THE DEFINITION FOR OF PUBLIC OFFENDS AND ALSO THE SERIES -- BODY INJURY -- A SOLO NEBULOUS LET ME JUST POINT OUT. TO WHERE I STAND ON IT. UP I THINK WHEN IT COMES TO PUBLIC OFFENSE I THINK IT'S BEEN ARTICULATED -- BY THE DA AND OB. TO INCLUDE INFRACTIONS FOR EXAMPLE. NOW AS FAR AS THE TERM SERIOUS BODILY INJURY. THE WAY THAT I READ IT IS THAT IS IT SAYS. ON THEY DEFINE CERES BODILY INJURY TO MEAN A SERIOUS IMPAIRMENT OF PHYSICAL CONDITION INCLUDING BUT NOT. LIMITED TO THE FOLLOWING. ONE LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS CONCUSSION BONE FRACTURE. AND THAT'S THE ONE THAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT BECAUSE I WHEN I WAS IN PRACTICE I DID A FEW FENDER BENDER CASES AND ALL. IN MANY OF THOSE INSTANCES OF PEOPLE HAD BILL FACTOR. AND DOT AND THEY WERE IN FASHION CASES SO WITH THIS NEW LAW. THERE WERE TALKING ABOUT -- SOMEBODY THE GOVERNMENT IN FACT TO HAVING THE ABILITY. TO GET POTENTIALLY GET THE BLACK BOX OF THAT VEHICLE. EVEN IF THE INJURY IS SIMPLY A BONE FRACTURE. SO WHICH IS AN INFRACTION. SO THAT'S FOR MY CONCERN IS OUR NOW. DE GRANTED AGAIN YOU KNOW DO YOU STILL HAVE THAT BUFFER BEING THAT THAT SEARCH WARRANT YOU KNOW THE JUDGE WOULD STILL HAVE TO APPROVE IT AND ALL THAT. BUT IT DOES OPEN UP SOME SOME -- SOME DOOR WHICH IS A WHICH DEVIATES FROM WHAT CURRENT LAW SAYS WHICH IS CAL UP ON OUR END AS FAR AND THE DA ALSO MISSION ABOUT THE THE PENAL CODE FOURTEEN TWENTY FOUR A BELIEF THAT PERTAINS ONLY. TO ON YOU KNOW BUT NON ELECTRONIC DEVICES BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW SMART PHONES AND AND AND AND AND YOU'RE TRYING TO DEVICES AND THE LIKE IN THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION. SO SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT I SO HAVE. IT'S IT'S A IT'S A FINE ON ARMED. THE DIFFERENCE -- BUT YET AYE AYE YEAH I DO APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU YOU TRY TO LIMIT THE BILL TO A VERY. VERY PARTICULAR SITUATION -- SITUATIONS BUT BUT YET I I'M STILL NOT VERY COMFORTABLE WITH THE WITH THE FOOTBALL FRACTURE SITUATION WHICH WILL CALL FOR THE BLAK BOX TO BE. TO BE HANDED OVER OF FOR EXAMPLE -- SO IF YOU HAVE AN ANSWER I I'D LOVE TO HEAR SO. TO BE CLEAR THE DEFINITION OF SERIOUS BODILY INJURY THAT YOU QUOTED. IS NOT FROM THIS BILL WE JUST REFERENCED THE SECTION OF STATE CO THE TO FIND SERIOUS BODILY INJURY BECAUSE WE WERE TRYING NOT TO REINVENT THE WHEEL. THAT THAT'S THE REASON WHY IT'S TO FIND THE WAY IT IS -- BUT SO WE HAD TO DRAW THE LINE SOMEWHERE AND THEN DO YOU KNOW THE DEFINITION OF SERIOUS BODILY INJURY ELSEWHERE IN STATE CODE IS. IS WHERE WE CHOSE TO DO IT BUT I'M OPEN TO ANY SUGGESTIONS ABOUT HOW TO FURTHER NARROW THE FOCUS OF THE BILL. SO THAT WE ACCOMPLISH WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE WITHOUT JEOPARDIZING PEOPLE'S PUBLIC SAFETY AND I THINK I'VE DEMONSTRATED A WILLINGNESS AS WE MOVE TO THE PROCESS HERE. TO TO REALLY BEND OVER BACKWARDS TO STRIKE THAT APPROPRIATE COMPROMISED AND GOT IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS COMMENTS. VERY GOOD IN -- WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE I I THINK WITH OUR COMMUNITY I FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE SO WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE YES BUT WE AS I SAID WE TRIED VERY HARD TO STRIKE AN APPROPRIATE BALANCE HERE. IN PROTECTING PEOPLE'S PRIVATE INFORMATION BUT ALSO GIVING LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES THE TOOLS THAT THEY NEED TO DO THEIR JOB INVESTIGATING THESE ACCIDENTS SO I'D RESPECTFULLY REQUEST DRIVE OUT. I THINK THE THERE IS A MOTION. TWENTY SECOND I NEED A SECOND SECOND. SO OUR MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. CHAO HI NOW I KILEY BARRICADE HAN HI BAUER-KAHAN I BERMAN. CALDERON CALDERON HI GABRIEL GALLAGHER. GALLAGHER I IRWIN -- WHEN I OBERNOLTE HI OBERNOLTE I SMITH? SMITH FIVE WEEKS. WHAT'S NOT VOTING. SEVEN SEVEN SEVEN ZERO SO YOUR BILL IS HELP -- I DO RESERVE MY RIGHT TO CHANGE MY VOTE. BEFORE THE FLOOR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MR -- IN EUROPE. ITEM ONE DEBTS AB. FIVE TWENTY THREE GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT AB FIVE TWO THREE TWO THIS AFTERNOON. THIS BILL IS IN RESPONSE TO A TROUBLING INVESTIGATIVE REPORT THAT UNCOVERED THE PRACTICE OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES. OR CELL PHONE COMPANIES SELLING SENSITIVE SUBSCRIBER INFORMATION WITH THE MOST CONCERNING BEING REAL TIME LOCATION DATA. THIS INFORMATION WAS AND PACKAGED AND RESOLD BY MIDDLEMAN TO ANYONE WILLING TO PAY USUALLY BOUNTY HUNTERS AND OTHERS WITH AN INTEREST IN FINDING AND STALKING INDIVIDUALS. UNDER CURRENT LAW THE SAME INFORMATION IS ONLY AVAILABLE TO LAW ENFORCEMENT WITH THE SEARCH WARRANTS AN IMPORTANT PROTECTION DUE TO THE HIGHLY SENSITIVE NATURE OF YOUR LOCATION. FEDERAL LAW AND REGULATIONS OF CLEARLY REQUIRED TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES TO PROTECT THIS DATA. AND TO ONLY SHARE A WITH SUBSCRIBERS CONSENT. HOWEVER THE ONLY FEDERAL ENFORCER THE FCC HAS FAILED TO HOLD TELECOM COMPANIES ACCOUNTABLE. AFTER THIS CONDUCT WAS UNCOVERED LAST SUMMER IN JUNE EVERY MAJOR TELECOM CO COMMITTED TO ENDING THIS PRACTICE. GET EVEN MORE INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALISM WAS ABLE -- TO AND INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALIST WAS ABLE TO OBTAIN REAL TIME LOCATION INFORMATION OF HER OWN CELL PHONE THIS JANUARY. THIS BELL BILL INTENDS TO MIRROR THE RESTRICTIONS ARE READY PRESENT IN FEDERAL LAW. IT DOES SO BY UPDATING DECADES OF CALIFORNIA PROTECTIONS THAT WERE ENACTED WHEN LANDLINES WERE THE ONLY FORM OF COMMUNICATION. AND AND HAVE BEEN OF FAR SURPASSED BY FEDERAL LAW THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS POINTS TO SOME AMBIGUOUS DRAFTING IN THE BILL THAT PUTS INTO QUESTION IF GEO LOCATION IS WITHIN THE DEFINITION DEFINITION OF CONSUMER. PROPRIETARY NETWORK INFORMATION OR CPNI. IN DRAFTING THE BILL OF MY INTENT WAS TO MERIT FEDERAL LAW AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE WITHOUT NAY UNNECESSARILY DISTURBING EXISTING STATELAW WHICH I BELIEVE HAS LED TO THIS AMBIGUITY. I'M COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE STAFF TO MAKE CLEAR THAT THE IN THE BILL THAT -- CONSISTENT WITH FCC RULINGS GEO LOCATION IS CPNI WITH AB FIVE TWO THREE CALIFORNIA'S WILL BE ABLE TO HOLD THESE TELECOMMUNICATIONS CEO AS TO THEIR WORD AND NOT HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE FCC TO DECIDE TO DO THEIR JOB. I AM PLEASED TO HAVE WITH ME TODAY TARA DíAS OF ANDREAS FROM THE P. UC'S PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE TO SPEAK AND SUPPORT AQ OUR FIRST WITNESS PLACE. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AGAIN TERRY IDEA SANDERS FROM THE PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE FORMALLY THE OFFICER REPAIR ADVOCATES. ON WE ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY THREE WHICH WOULD HELP STRENGTHEN CRAZY PRIVACY PROTECTIONS FOR CUSTOMERS OF TELEPHONE COURT CORPORATIONS INCLUDING -- WIRELESS PROVIDERS. THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE ROYALIST PROVIDERS TO OBTAIN WRITTEN CONSENT FROM THEIR CUSTOMERS BEFORE THEY SELL OR SHARE THE CUSTOMER'S REAL TIME. LOCATION INFORMATION TO OTHER INDIVIDUALS AND BUSINESSES. ALTHOUGH WIRELESS CARRIERS HAVE CLAIMED THAT THEY DO NOT SO CUSTOMERS YOUR LOCATION DATA RECENT INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE DATA SHARING PRACTICES. OF WIRELESS CARRIERS HAVE SHOWN THE STATEMENTS TO BE FALSE. WE SUPPORT THIS BILL BECAUSE IT WOULD HELP PUT AN END TO THIS PRACTICE AND STRENGTH AND PRIVACY PROTECTIONS THAT THE CUSTOMERS TO SERVE THANK YOU. NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. ADDITIONAL SUPPORT OPPOSITION PLEASE COME FORWARD. CHAU SUPPORT -- MORE MONEY ON BEHALF OF CONSUMER REPORTS HOW WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE GOALS THIS LEGISLATION IN KEEPING WITH OUR SUPPORT OF AMENDED POSITION THANK YOU THANK YOU MUCH OPPOSITION. YOU MAY BEGIN MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS STEVE CARLSON FOR CTIA THE WIRELESS INDUSTRY. INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH MR WAY AND AND HAD OUR SOME OF OUR COMPANY'S PRIVACY EXPERTS ON THE PHONE WITH THEIR STAFF THE OTHER DAY. TO TRY TO WORK THROUGH SOME OF THE ISSUES AND I THINK THE THE ANALYSIS DOES POINT OUT THAT THERE IS SOME CONFUSION AN OVERLAP WITH THE C. C. P. A. WITH THE FEDERAL RULES AND THE LIKES IS WE'RE TRYING. TO SORT SOME OF THAT OUT BUT I THOUGHT IT IMPORTANT TO MAYBE SET THE CONTEXT FOR HOW. THIS HAPPENED -- THE DATA WAS PROVIDED TO A THIRD PARTY AGGREGATOR BY EACH OF THE CARRIERS. TO TO DO THINGS LIKE PROVIDE DATA FOR ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE IN LIFE ALERT -- CHECK VERIFICATION -- THE THINGS THAT HELP CUSTOMERS IN THE DECIDED TO USE THE AGGREGATOR BECAUSE IT WAS EASY TO WORK THROUGH ONE ENTITY RATHER THAN HAVE EACH CARRIER DO THAT. OF THE INFORMATION UNFORTUNATELY WAS TAKEN BY THAT AGGREGATOR AND USE FOR PURPOSES THAT THE CARRIERS HAD NOT INTENDED -- THAT PRACTICE WAS STOPPED PERHAPS NOT QUICKLY ENOUGH -- FOR FOR FOR SOME BUT IT HAS STOPPED -- IN IT IT ALSO HAS KIND OF RAISED A COUPLE OF A POTENTIAL ISSUES WITH SUPPORTING. OF THOSE. SERVICES -- ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE IN LIFE ALERT I MEAN BASED UPON. THE WAY THE BILL IS WRITTEN IT'S CONCEIVABLE THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE TO GO AND GET WRITTEN CONSENT TO GET A TOW TRUCK I DON'T THINK THAT'S WHAT IT'S INTENDED. BUT WITH THE WAY THAT THE BILL HAS IS CRAFTED -- WE'RE CONCERNED THAT THAT THE ABILITY TO ACCESS THAT INFORMATION IS -- HIS HIS PERHAPS -- THREATENED -- WE HAVE HAD SOME CONVERSATIONS THAT THE FOOD AND AND IF THERE WAS AN EARLIER BILL WE TALKED ABOUT THE SAME THING WERE WRITTEN CONSENT. IS PROBABLY NOT A STANDARD THAT THAT IS APPROPRIATE IN THIS INSTANCE AND AND THERE OUGHT TO BE A IT OUGHT TO BE A BROADER WAY TO DEAL WITH THAT IF IN FACT -- WE'RE GONNA MOVE FORWARD. MOVE FORWARD LIKE THIS. BUT AGAIN THIS IS A TECHNOLOGY SPECIFIC BILL. IT PROVIDES A THE REQUIREMENT OF OF NOW WRITTEN CONSENT OR AFFIRMATIVE OPT IN CONSENT ONLY -- TO ONLY TO WHAT WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS -- BUT BUT IT'S ANY KIND OF GEO LOCATION -- IT'S NOT PRECISE YOUR LOCATION NECESSARILY COULD BE STATED COULD BE CITY IT COULD BE STUFF THAT'S HARMLESS NOT -- CONNECT DOUBLE REASONABLY LIKABLE TO PERSONAL INFORMATION -- AND SUCH THAT I THINK RULE RAISES SOME CONCERNS ABOUT HOW OF YOU KNOW WORKING WITH THE PHILLY IT'S ABOUT. TO THE BIG TAXATION ISSUES THE PLACE A PRIMARY USE VERSUS YOU KNOW WE HAVE AN ERROR CODE SO -- WHAT'S UP I KNOW MISS SAID MS IRWIN AND WE DISAGREE ON THIS POINT -- BUT THERE ARE MEN IN THE ANALYSIS DOES POINT OUT -- THAT -- THAT THIS DOES NOT APPLY TO OTHER BUSINESSES THAT MAKE APPLICATIONS AVAILABLE ON A PHONE TO CONSUMERS AND THEIR BY COLLECT USE OR SHARE THE USER'S GPS DATA. SOMETIMES GPS DATA -- THAT'S FAR MORE ACCURATE THAN THE THAN THAN THE WIRELESS THE CELL SITE DATA -- WE DO GET CRITICIZED SOMETIMES IN THE NINE ONE ONE ERR ARENA FOR THE LOCATION NOT BEING PRECISE ENOUGH -- YET IRONICALLY -- WE NOW ARE THE ONLY ONES TO BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE AFFIRMATIVE OPT IN CONSENT NO MATTER WHAT TYPE OF GEO LOCATION DATA THAT SO WE ARE WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT -- THE END OF WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT ALTHOUGH I THINK THAT'S A FUNDAMETAL DISAGREEMENT WE DO HAVE WITH THE AUTHOR -- BUT WE ARE JUST CONTINUING TO WORK ON AND ELEMENTS OF THE BILL MANY OF WHICH WERE POINTED OUT IN THE IN THE VERY THOROUGH ANALYSIS -- TO SEE IF WE CAN GET A LITTLE CLOSER ON THIS BUT SO AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION. SEEN ON OUR QUESTIONS COMMENTS MISS POWER CAN GO AHEAD PLEASE. SO I WANT TO THANK YOU MISTER ONE FOR BRINGING THIS BELL AND I'LL BE SUPPORTING IT BECAUSE I THINK YOU ARE GOOD AUTHOR IN THE SPACE AND I TRUST YOU TO WORK THROUGH ALL THIS BECAUSE I CAN IMAGINE THAT YOU DID NOT INTEND FOR EMERGENCY SERVICES TO NOT BE. ABLE TO GET TO CONSUMERS AND SO I TRUST THAT IS THIS APPROACH IS THE FLOOR A LOT OF THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED AUDITS. THINGS LIKE THAT WILL BE ADDRESSED AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THE VERSION ON THE FLOOR THAT WILL PROTECT THIS DATA. AND ALSO. ADDRESS SOME OF THESE CONCERNS THANK YOU. MR OBERNOLTE CUT. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS IN THE LAST COMMITTEE AND YOU WERE VERY GOOD ABOUT REACHING OUT ANSWERING THEM SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT. I HAD A QUESTION FOR THE OPPOSITION AND IT MIGHT JUST BE A LIMITATION OF MY UNDERSTANDING OF FEDERAL LAW BUT THIS FEDERAL LAW. PERMIT CURRENTLY THE SALE OF NON ANONYMIZED DATA OF THIS TYPE. I I DON'T THINK I THINK THIS IS ANONYMIZED DATA BUT BUT IT WAS ALSO PROVIDED WITH CONSENT SO THAT THE SITUATION THAT WE ARE -- THE I. DESCRIBED AND I'VE I NEGLECTED TO SAY THAT THE INFORMATION THAT WAS PROVIDED TO THE AGGREGATOR WAS -- WITH THE CONSENT. FOR THE ABILITY -- TO TO PURSUE THE SERVICES THAT -- THAT WAS PROVIDED FOR OKAY SO WAS THE DATA THAT WAS PROVIDED TO THE AGGREGATOR WAS AT ANONYMIZED OR NON ANONYMIZED BILLY WAS ANONYMIZED OKAY BUT BUT ALSO WITH WITH CONSENT. OKAY SO MY QUESTION IS IF THE DATA WAS ANONYMIZED A MEANS TO SO SOME OF THE PROBLEM CASES THAT HAVE BEEN -- WOULD THAT HAVE LED TO THIS BILL ARE CASES WHERE -- PEOPLE HAD -- A BOUNTY HUNTER. YOU KNOW IT ACQUIRED THE DATA FOR EXAMPLE IS ONE SO HOW WOULD THAT HOW WOULD ANONYMIZE DATA BE OF ANY USE. IN THEIR CATECHISM UNDERSTAND HOW HOW IT COULD HAVE BEEN ANONYMIZED IN YEAH AND STILL BIT OF USE. I BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS A COMBINATION OF THE DATA AND THEN THE USE OF APPS. IN ADDITION TO SOME OF THE DATA WHICH LED -- TO MORE SPECIFIC ABILITY -- TO TO IDENTIFY THE YOU KNOW WHATEVER THE SITUATION WAS AND AGAIN. WE CERTAINLY NEVER INTENDED THAT THAT DATA BE PROVIDED TO A BOUNTY HUNTER BUT I DON'T BELIEVE IT WAS PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION. OKAY WELL I MEAN I JUST THINK THAT THE THAT PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES AN ILLUSTRATION OF WHY. THIS TYPE OF DATA IS SO SENSITIVE. THERE IS IT SOMEONE CAN TAKE IT AND USE IT IN WAYS THAT WE DIDN'T IN TOWN MAYBE IN COMBINATION WITH OTHER BITS OF DATA ESPECIALLY WITH -- THE POWER MACHINE LEARNING NOW AND AND PUT TOGETHER THINGS THAT ARE REALLY ASTONISHING SO -- THAT AGREED AND IT'S AGAIN IT'S NOT JUST LIMITED TO THIS. SPECIFIC TECHNOLOGY WE WE BELIEVE IT SHOULD NOT BE THE WHO BUT THE WHAT -- THAT IS TREATED SIMILARLY -- WITH RESPECT TO STATE POLICY AND WE DON'T DELETED RB WE DON'T THINK WE'RE THERE YET. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- I EIGHT CHAIRMAN IF I COULD I'D JUST LIKE TO RESPOND BRIEFLY RESPOND PLACE -- TO MEMBER -- KINDS THAT COMMENT -- THIS THE AUTHOR DOES HAVE DID TAKE CONSIDERATION OF EXCEPTIONS OF WHAT WOULD NOT BE INCLUDED IN THIS BILL AND ONE OF THEM IS INFORMATION PROVIDED TO EMERGENCY. EMERGENCY SERVICE AGENCY RESPONDING TO NINE ONE ONE TELEPHONE CALL OR ANY OTHER CALL COMMUNICATING EMINENT THREAT TO LIFE OR PROPERTY IN ADDITION TO INFORMATION PROVIDED TO A LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY A RESPONSE TO LAWFUL PROCESS. SO SHE HAS MADE A TENSE -- TO ADDRESS LEGITIMATE CONCERNS THAT THE OPPOSITION IS REST. THE VERY MUCH -- BEFORE I ASK YOU TO CLOSE -- I I WANNA MAKE THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT. AS THE OLD ONE OF THE AUTHORS OF A CCPA FROM LAST YEAR I I NEED -- TO BILL A MORE CAUTIOUS WHEN IT COMES TO LEGISLATION THAT WOULD POTENTIALLY IMPACTS THE CPA. AND THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION ARE WE DEALING WITH THAT YOUR LOCATION WHICH IS A VERY IMPORTANT -- COMPONENT OF OF OUR PRIVACY AND DATA. I'M SO. I THINK THE INTENT I THINK YOUR INTENT IS ESSENTIALLY ASKED FOR IT OPT IN SO BUT THERE'S ALSO THE YOU KNOW THE FEDERAL LAW. ODDS THAT WE NEED TO TACKLE A SO I'M. SO I I'M GONNA TRY TO LAY OFF TODAY ARE. YOU KNOW I WANT TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHETHER OR NOT YOUR BILL WILL -- HOW IT INTERACTS WITH C. CPI ARE? SO -- YOU KNOW THAT THAT WAY I WOULD FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE I NEED A LITTLE TIME SO. TO SO I'M GONNA STAY OFF TODAY SO I I KNOW THERE THE BILL'S BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED SO -- SO -- I'M GONNA ASK YOU TO CLOSE IT -- YEAH AND AND WE UNDERSTAND CECE'S PA -- DOES OVERLAP WITH FEDERAL LAW AND WOOD OVER LOVE -- OVERLAP WITH THIS BILL AS IT DOES WITH LAND MINES ALSO AND AND SO -- WE THINK THAT WE'VE GONE THROUGH THE DIFFERENCE IN OURS BUT I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND. THAT -- WITH YOU BEING THE AUTHOR OF CCPA THAT YOU WANT TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE CAUTIOUS BUT AGAIN THIS IS BASED ON YOU KNOW BECAUSE I THINK THINGS WERE A LITTLE. OF METAL THIS IS BASED ON A SITUATION WHERE -- THE REAL TIME INFORMATION WAS AVAILABLE -- TO A TWO BOUNTY HUNTERS AND ANYBODY ELSE THAT WANTED TO FOLLOW SOMEBODY THIS IS IT AND WILL BE REALLY SPECIFIC THIS IS -- CELL PHONE TOWER TRIANGULATION THIS IS NOT LOCATION DATA FROM THE APPS. AND THIS IS ALREADY AGAINST OF FEDERAL LAW. BUT THE FCC IS NOT ENFORCING IT SO WE THOUGHT IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO GET IT TO BE BUT PART OF CPUC. CODE TO MAKE SURE THAT SAID THAT WE HAD FORCES AND THE REASON THAT IT IT DOES NOT APPLY. TO THE CABLE COMPANIES OR OTHER CARRIERS BESIDE CELL PHONE COMPANIES IS BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT SEEN THIS. BEHAVIOR FRANKLY FROM THEM THIS IS THE SPECIFICALLY THE CELL PHONE COMPANIES THAT WERE SELLING THIS INFORMATION EVEN THOUGH THEY HAD SAID THAT THEY WERE NOT GOING. TO SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR EITHER THANK YOU VERY MUCH A ROLL CALL PLEASE CHAO. KILEY. BAR CAM I BAUER-KAHAN I BERMAN. CALDERON.
