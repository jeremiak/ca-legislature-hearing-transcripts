TO ADDRESS ANY OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD. THANK BY VOTERS AND POLL WORKERS LAST YEAR I AUTHORED AB EIGHT SIXTY WHICH WAS A SUCCESSFUL BIPARTISAN EFFORT TO SEND EVERY ACTIVE REGISTERED VOTER A BALLOT IN THE MAIL. AMONG OTHER PROVISIONS. ACCORDING TO THE SECRETARY STATE OVER EIGHTY SIX POINT 5% OF THE SEVENTEEN AND A HALF MILLION CALIFORNIANS. PARTICIPATED IN THE NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTY L. AT THE GENERAL ELECTION. VOTED ON THE BALLOT THAT WAS MAILED TO THE SHOWS THAT SENDING EVERYONE A BALLOT IN THE MAIL PROVIDES VOTERS ACCESS WHEN VOTERS GET BALLOTS IN THE MAIL THEY VOTE. SB THIRTY SEVEN WILL MAKE SOME OF THESE IMPROVEMENTS PERMANENT ENSURING THAT EVERY ACTIVE REGISTERED VOTERS MAILED A BALLOT FOR EVERY ELECTION. SIMILAR TO PROVISIONS IN MY EIGHTY EIGHT SIXTY LAST YEAR SB THIRTY SEVEN MAKES A NUMBER OF OTHER IMPORTANT ACCOMMODATIONS. HELP FACILITATE VOTING BY MAIL IN FUTURE ELECTIONS. IT ALLOWS COUNTIES TO BEGIN PROCESSING A RETURN TO VOTE BY MAIL BALLOTS EARLIER. SO THAT THEY CAN BETTER MANAGE THEIR WORKLOAD TO GET MORE BALLOTS COUNTED ON ELECTION NIGHT. EXTENDS THE DEADLINE FOR RECEIPT OF VOTE BY MAIL BALLOT SO THAT VOTERS ARE NOT DISENFRANCHISED. BY POTENTIAL POSTAL SERVICE DELAYS. THAT DIFFERENTLY THIS BILL SETS MINIMUM VOTE BY MAIL BALLOT DROP OFF LOCATION REQUIREMENTS. ALONG VOTERS TO CONVENIENTLY RETURN THEIR BALLOT. SB THIRTY SEVEN ALSO ENSURES VOTERS CONTRACT OR BALLOTS AS THEY MOVE THROUGH THE MAIL SYSTEM. AND A PROCESS BY ELECTIONS OFFICIALS. THANK YOU FOR OUR CONSIDERATION AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE- AND TESTIFYING TODAY ARE CHRISTOPHE MAIRE. OF ABSENTEE CALIFORNIA AND REAR GILBERT CALPERS STUDENTS.

SO FIRST LET ME INVITE- CHRISTOPH MAIER THE LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE FOR ASKING CALIFORNIA TO- PREPARE AND PRESENT HIS TESTIMONY. WELCOME THANK YOU MORNING CHAIR NUMBERS WE HAD ASKED ME STAND IN STRONG SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTY SEVEN WHICH CONTINUES CALIFORNIA'S PUSH TOWARD MORE ACCEPTABLE ELECTIONS FOR ALL OUR STATE STANDS IN STARK CONTRAST WITH OTHER STATES IN THE COUNTRY THAT CURRENTLY SEEK TO MAKE VOTING MORE DIFFICULT. WHAT'S THAT PLACE RESTRICTIONS ON VOTING DISPROPORTIONATELY AND OFTEN INTENTIONALLY DISENFRANCHISED PEOPLE OF COLOR AND LOWER INCOME INDIVIDUALS. LAWS SUCH AS AB THIRTY SEVEN ON THE OTHER HAND ALLOW FOR FLEXIBILITY IN THE VOTING PROCESS AND ELIMINATE THE SCHEDULING CONFLICTS. WHICH CONTINUE TO BE A BARRIER FOR VOTING FOR MANY. THIS MEASURE WILL RESULT IN AN ADDITION IN AN ADDITIONAL TWO POINT THREE MILLION BALLOTS BEING SENT TO VOTERS WHO MAY NOT BE ABLE TO VOTE OTHERWISE. A RELIABLE TRACKING SYSTEM WILL PROVIDE VOTERS WITH CLARITY AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO MANY BALLOTS. THAT ARE FLAGGED AS IMPROPER. STUDIES FROM THE PAST DECADE BY ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY DARTMOUTH BRIGHAM YOUNG UNIVERSITY THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL LAWYERS ASSOCIATION AND MANY OTHERS HAVE ALL FOUND THAT VOTING FRAUD IS INCREDIBLY RARE AND ISOLATED. FOR ALL THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR SUPPORT FOR A BI THIRTY SEVEN THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR FOR YOUR TESTIMONY I WANT TO INVITE RIA GILBERT- WHO'S THE CHAIR OF CALPERS STUDENTS TO I JOIN US I THINK ON OUR PHONE LINES.

LOCALLY IS BETTER TURNOUT IS ON THE RISE IN TWENTY TWENTY YEARS BURGER TURNOUT AND CALIFORNIA INCREASED BY SEVENTEEN PERCENTAGE POINTS FROM THE TWENTY SIXTEEN ELECTION ONE OF THE BIGGEST INCREASES OF ANY STATE. CALIFORNIA'S DECISION TO SEND EVERY VOTER A VOTE BY MAIL BALLOT WOULD LIKELY A MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR TO THE INCREASE IN TURNOUT AND OTHER STATES IMPLEMENTED BOTH BY MAIL PROGRAMS ALSO SAW THE LARGEST INCREASE IN YOUTH VOTER TURNOUT. WITH THIS BILL I'M CERTAIN WE'LL SEE MORE YOUNG PEOPLE TURN OUT TO GO AND PARTICIPATE IN OUR DEMOCRACY. YOU DON'T HAVE A PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT TIME GETTING TO THE POLLS AS THEY OFTEN HAVE MULTIPLE OBLIGATIONS SUCH AS CLASSES ARE WORK THEY CANNOT GET OUT OF.

THANK YOU SENATOR NEWMAN. THE OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER- ONE ISSUE THAT HAS COME UP IN SOME OF THE CORRESPONDENCE IS THE ISSUE OF MAYBE PEOPLE OF THE OVERSEAS BALLOTS- THAT MIGHT PUT THEM IN THE MAIL- BEFORE ELECTION DAY BUT- JUST BY THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MAY NOT GET IN TIME I AS I UNDERSTAND YOUR BILL A LIMITS THE COUNTING TO SEVEN DAYS AFTER THE ELECTION AS POST MARKET TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE YEAH SO- EXISTING LAW PRIOR TO TWENTY TWENTY WAS THREE DAYS- IN TWENTY TWENTY WE EXTENDED IT TO SEVENTEEN DAYS BECAUSE WE'RE WORRIED ABOUT- COVERT RELATED DELAYS TO THE MAIL SERVICE- BUT THAT WAS NEVER MEANT TO. BE THE PERMANENT- EXTENSION SO IN IN THIS BILL WE CHOSE SEVEN DAYS THAT CAME OUT OF DATA FROM THE SECRETARY OF STATE AND DISCUSSIONS WITH COUNTY ELECTIONS OFFICIALS TO TRY TO FIND A SWEET SPOT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW NOBODY WHO WHO. TRIES TO VOTE AND DOES VOTE LEGALLY- HAS THE ROAD DISCARDED BUT THAT LSO WE GIVE THE ELECTIONS OFFICIALS TIME TO THE YOU KNOW PROCESS THE BALLOT THAT THEY RECEIVE AND CERTIFY THE ELECTION AND THEN DO YOU THINK AND I THINK THERE MIGHT BE SOME REFERENCE OF THIS MAN ALICE'S. WHAT WOULD YOU THINK THAT CAPTURES IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF FOLKS I MEAN HOW MANY PEOPLE DO YOU THINK WOULD GET EXCLUDED FROM CIRCUIT BUT YOU KNOW BAD CIRCUMSTANCE OR MAYBE EVEN AGAIN A BALLOT FROM OVERSEAS THAT TAKES A LOT LONGER TO GET HERE IF YOU HAVE ANY SENSE OF. UNDER THE SEVEN DAY HOW MANY WOULD MIGHT BE EXCLUDED I NORMAL I DON'T- BUT I CAN I CAN GET BACK TO YOU- ON THAT OUR OLD CHECK THE ANALYSIS ALSO TO SEE IF THERE'S BETTER DATA AND THERE MY GOAL IS THAT NOBODY GETS EXCLUDED- SO- HAPPY TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD AND CAN HAVE THEM BE A PART OF OUR CONVERSATION TERRIFIC I WOULD APPRECIATE THAT I. I AM NOT HAPPY TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY I THINK THIS EFFORT TO MAIL BALLOTS TO VOTERS IS AN INCREDIBLE PROGRESSIVE OUTREACH SAID IT THAT MAKES CALIFORNIA SHINE REALLY IN THE COUNTRY FOR OUR BELIEF THAT VOTING MATTERS WE WANT TO MAKE IT IS EASY- AND HONEST AS POSSIBLE. AND I THINK THAT YOU'VE REALLY TAKEN THE LEAD IN THIS AREA I. OF YOUR LEADER. IN I THINK THIS BILL REFLECTS. REALLY GOOD STRONG. PUBLIC POLICY ABOUT THE EXPERIENCES THAT WE HAVE HAD RELIED UPON THOSE. SEEN HOW TURNOUT HAS GONE OUT. AND IT'S ALL POINTED IN A VERY POSITIVE DIRECTION AS REFLECTED IN YOUR BILL TO HAPPY TO SUPPORT TODAY. THANK YOU I RECOGNIZE EMOTIONS. FROM SENATOR NEWMAN LAW TO GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO CLOSE HI I COULDN'T. SAY IT DO IT BETTER THAN YOU JUST DID- I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE THANK YU FOR YOUR SUPPORT. OKAY SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE A MOTION TO PASS AS AMENDED IS THAT CORRECT. TO APPROPRIATIONS. AND IF THE CONSULTANT WOULD CALL THE ROLL. AB THIRTY SEVEN THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED THE FIRST pCOMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS GLAZER AYE GLAZER AYE NIELSEN. NIELSEN NO HERTZBERG. LEYVA NEWMAN ALL RIGHT NEWMAN HI. ALL RIGHT SO THAT THE BILL IS GOING TO BE PUT ON CALL AS WE WAIT FOR OUR ABSENT MEMBERS. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN FOR THAT AND YOU AT THE ITEM NUMBER TWO ON OUR AGENDA AS WELL. A. B. SEVEN SEVEN FIVE. AND YOU ARE WELCOME TO BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN SENATORS PERSONAL LIKE THE START BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE SUGGESTED. TECHNICAL MOMENT THAT IS FOUND IN COMMON NUMBER TWO ON PAGE FIVE OF THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. I WANT TO THANK YOU AGAIN THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR THOUGHTFUL ANALYSIS OF THIS BILL. AND FOR IDENTIFYING THE TECHNICAL ISSUE. IN APRIL THE NEW YORK TIMES RELEASED AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE PRACTICE OF POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS. USING PRE CHECKED BOXES THAT AUTHORIZED RECURRING DONATIONS WHEN A PERSON. MAKES A CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION ONLINE. IN PARTICULAR THE REPORT FOUND THAT FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP'S REELECTION CAMPAIGN. MADE EXTENSIVE USE OF THESE PRE CHECKED BOXES. AS THE CAMPAIGN RAN LOW ON MONEY ITS TACTICS BECAME INCREASINGLY DECEPTIVE AND IT FIXED UP TO OBSCURE DISCLOSURES. THAT DONORS WERE AUTHORIZING RECURRING CONTRIBUTIONS BY FEELING THE DESELECT THOSE PRE CHECKED BOXES. THE CAMPAIGN ADDITIONALLY CHANGE THE DONATIONS FROM MONTHLY TO WEEKLY. HE HAD ADDED A SECOND PRE CHECK BOX. THAT AUTHORIZED AN ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTION TO BE MADE LATER IN THE MONTH. AS A RESULT A FAILURE BY A DONOR TO DESELECT THESE PRE CHECKED BOXES. COULD RESULT IN THAT DONOR MAKING AS MANY AS. SIX CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS IN ONE MONTH. SOME CONTENT SHOULD HAD THEIR ACCOUNT DRAINED FROZEN. WHETHER CREDIT CARD MAXED OUT. OTHER ENDED UP MAKING CAMPAIGN DONATIONS WELL IN EXCESS OF THE MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE UNDER FEDERAL LAW. AS A RESULT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN ENDED UP REFUNDING TEN POINT 7% OF THE MONEY THAT IT RAISED ONLINE IN TWENTY TWENTY. A RATE NEARLY FIVE TIMES TAT OF THE BIDEN CAMPAIGNS REFUND RATE FOR ONLINE CONTRIBUTIONS. IN ALL THE NEW YORK TIMES REPORTED THAT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND AFFILIATED POLITICAL ORGANIZATIONS. WERE FORCED TO REFUND OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS. TOTALING MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED TWENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS. IN CALIFORNIA AT LEAST ONE MAJOR CANDIDATE FOR GOVERNOR IN THE UPCOMING RECALL ELECTION CONTINUES TO USE. THESE PRE CHECKED BOXES TO AUTHORIZE RECURRING CAMPAIGN DONATIONS. AND OTHER POLITICAL COMMITTEES CONTINUE TO SOLICIT RECURRING DONATIONS FOR DECEITFUL.PRECHECK AUTHORIZATION BOXES. EARLIER THIS MONTH ONE SUCH SOLICITATION WARRANTED DONORS THAT ON CHECKING THE PRESELECTED AUTHORIZATION BOX. WOULD QUOTE HELP THE LEFT CANCEL THE FOURTH OF JULY IN THE RACE. TRUMP I'M GLAD WE ALL WERE ABLE TO ENJOY YOUR FOURTH OF JULY. CANDIDATES AND POLITICAL CAMPAIGN SHOULD NOT HAVE TO RELY ON THAT KIND OF DECEPTION AND TRICKERY TO RAISE MONEY TO FUND THEIR CAMPAIGNS. THAT'S WHY I'M OFFERING AB AB SEVEN SEVENTY FIVE WHICH PROHIBITS CANDIDATES OR COMMITTEES FROM SOLICITING OR ACCEPTING. RECURRING CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS WITHOUT RECEIVING THE CONTRIBUTORS AFFIRMATIVE CONSENT. SB SEVEN SEVENTY FIVE FURTHER MAKES IT CLEAR THAT A PRE CHECK BOX. AUTHORIZING A RECURRING CONTRIBUTION DOES NOT MEET THE REQUIREMENTS FOR AFFIRMATIVE CONSENT. CAMPAIGNS WOULD STILL BE ABLE TO ASK CONTRIBUTORS TO SIGN UP TO MAKE RECURRING DONATIONS. BUT THE CONTRIBUTORS WOULD HAVE TO TAKE AFFIRMATIVE STEPS. TO ENROLL THEMSELVES IN RECURRING CONTRIBUTIONS. SB SEVEN SEVENTY FIVE ADDITIONALLY REQUIRES A CANDIDATE OR COMMITTEE THAT ACCEPTS A RECURRING CONTRIBUTIONS. TO PROVIDE A RECEIPT FOR EACH CONTRIBUTION. TO PROVIDE INFORMATION NECESSARY TO CANCEL THE RECURRING CONTRIBUTION. INTO IMMEDIATELY CANCEL A RECURRING CONTRIBUTION UPON REQUEST. I HOPE YOU WILL JOIN ME IN WORKING TO AT A PRACTICE THAT DAN SCHNUR. A FORMER CHAIR OF THE FEDERAL AND THE FAIRPORT A PRACTICES COMMISSION. CALLED THE QUOTE AND- RIGHT. PRACTICE THAT TAKES ADVANTAGE OF INNOCENT PEOPLE AND QUOTE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER AS I UNDERSTAND IT WE DON'T HAVE ANY LEAD THAT WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THAT WE HAVE SOMEONE AVAILABLE FOR TECHNICAL QUESTIONS- BUT LET'S GO TO HERE IN THIRTY ONE NINETY ONE TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY WITNESSES WHO WISH TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT.

WE MUST ENSURE THAT OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE STRUCTURED A WITH AT LEAST THE BEST ELECTED REPRESENTATION POSSIBLE. THIS BILL GUARANTEES ACCOUNTABILITY FOR COUNTY SUPERVISOR BY ALLOWING THEM TO STAND FOR RE ELECTION GAIN EXPERTISE TO THE JOB FOR A MINIMUM OF TWO ELECTED TERMS IN OFFICE. WILL ALSO CONTINUE TO ALLOW THEM ADEQUATE COMPENSATION AS LAID OUT IN THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION. TO HAVE QUALIFIED CANDIDATES FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE THAT ARE NOT JUST INDEPENDENTLY WEALTHY. AB TWENTY DOES NOT CONTAIN A RETROACTIVE CLAUSE IT WILL NOT DIRECTLY OVERTURN. ANY LOCAL MEASURES WANT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT THAT. ADDITIONALLY BUT WORKING WITH THE CHAIRED THE COMMITTEE I'M ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD FURTHER CLARIFY. THAT THIS MEASURE IS PROSPECTIVE IN NATURE.

IT ALSO MAKES YOU FEEL A LITTLE BIT OF LIKE WHAT'S HAPPENING IN GEORGIA- PEOPLE DIDN'T LIKE WHAT HAPPENED IN GEORGIA THE OUTCOME OF THE VOTE SO NOW PEOPLE IN POWER ARE TRYING TO CHANGE. THE WAY PEOPLE VOTE TO GET THE OUTCOME THAT THEY WANT. I DO BELIEVE THAT A ONE TERM TERM LIMIT IS TERRIBLE AND IT WILL NOT ALLOW PEOPLE TO GET THE EXPERTISE.

AND WHAT PEOPLE THINK WE DID AND WHAT WE ACTUALLY DID- IT'S THEIR PERCEPTION IS OUR REALITY. AND I THINK THAT MOST PEOPLE WILL NOT SEE IT AND KNOW THAT IT'S PERSPECTIVE. AND IT'S STILL TO ME LOOKS LIKE A WORKAROUND SOMETHINGS I AGREE I. READ THE LANGUAGE I UNDERSTAND BUT I JUST THINK IT LOOKS BAD FOR ALL OF US. THANK YOU CENTER LEYVA ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER THANK YOU- FOR WORKING WITH ME AND MY STAFF ON THIS BILL. AND TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR INTENTIONS ARE CLEAR AND THAT THE PLAIN LANGUAGE THAT IS BEING PROPOSED. AND I THINK THAT. A LOT OF THIS BILL ON THE FACT THAT THE EXISTING- LIMITATIONS OR- LACK THEREOF IN IN PLACES LIKE SAN BERNARDINO. I RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS REALLY SENDING A MESSAGE TO THE BROADER COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT OUR STATE. THAT MAY BE CONSIDERING TERM LIMITS GOING FORWARD AND- FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES ARE THAT. THAT FOR THE HUNDREDS OF CITIES. THAT THEY'RE WELCOME TO DO THAT THERE'S NO LIMITATION PLACED ON HERE EXCEPT FOR THE ONE THAT. SAYS THAT YOU JUST CAN'T LIMITED LESS THAN TWO TERMS YEAH THAT TO GIVEN OUR EXPERIENCE AND- IN HOW WE UP. HE KNOWS THE CHALLENGES OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. THAT YOU DO NEED TO HAVE SOME EXPERIENCE TO BE ABLE TO BE THOUGHTFUL IN THOSE SPACES SO. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THE BILL. TO US AND FOR WORKING WITH US IN THE LANGUAGE THE SENATE. AND WE WELCOME YOUR CLOTHES. I THINK YOU JUST- WANTED TO MAYBE GIVE SORT OF. A QUICK STORY- I FIRST GOT ELECTED TO. A CITY COUNCIL MY HOMETOWN WHEN I WAS TWENTY FIVE YEARS OLD STARTED RUNNING WHEN I WAS TWENTY FOUR- AND- I REMEMBER BEING SORT OF BRIGHT EYED- AND VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE IDEA OF BEING ABLE TO- TO SERVE- THE COMMUNITY THAT I GREW UP IN. I GOT ELECTED WHEN I WAS WHEN I WAS TWENTY FIVE. AND I REMEMBER THINKING. AT TWENTY FIVE YEARS OLD MAYBE SOME OF YOU CAN RELATE THAT I HAD ALL THE ANSWERS I HAD IT ALL. FIGURED OUT. AND ALL I NEEDED TO DO IS JUST HAVE THAT OFFICE AND I WAS- I WAS GOING TO BE ABLE TO. OTHER OF MY- MY SMALL TOWN. IT BECAME PRETTY CLEAR TO ME IN MY SMALL TOWN OF. A TWENTY ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE A WITH A FIFTY EMPLOYEES. AND A BUDGET OF AROUND TEN MILLION DOLLARS. THAT HAD AN AWFUL LOT TO LEARN. I READ EVERY SINGLE WORD OF THAT AGENDA PACKET BEFORE I WENT TO THE VOTE- AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT AFTER THREE YEARS OF ME SERVING ON THAT COUNCIL. I STILL DIDN'T HAVE IT FIGURED OUT IN FACT IT PROBABLY TOOK ME FIVE YEARS TO REALLY UNDERSTAND. THAT THE DECISION THAT I WAS MAKING THE LONG TERM IMPACT OF THOSE OF THOSE DECISIONS. AND THAT'S FOR A LITTLE TINY TOWN OF JUST TWENTY ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE WITH FIFTY EMPLOYEES AND A BUDGET. OF TEN MILLION DOLLARS A CONTRACTED OUT. OF FIRE AND POLICE SERVICES. IMAGINE A COUNTY. OF NORTH OF TWO MILLION PEOPLE. THAT THAT HAS A BUDGET OF FIVE SIX BILLION DOLLARS DISCRETIONARY BUDGET OF ALMOST A BILLION DOLLARS IN AT THE AVERAGE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT YOU WOULD SERVE ON THAT BOARD WOULD BE EITHER ONE AND A HALF YEARS OR TWO AND A HALF YEARS THERE'S NOT ENOUGH TIME FOR THOSE MEMBERS THE BOARD TO FULLY UNDERSTAND THE DECISIONS THAT ARE BEING MADE. THIS IS NOT ABOUT GOING BACK IN- IN OVERTURNING THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE FOR THOSE WHO'VE ALREADY VOTED BUT IT IS MAKING SURE THAT THAT GOING FORWARD FOR THE OTHER FIFTY SEVEN COUNTIES I IN CALIFORNIA WHO- BEAR MIGHT BE INITIATIVE THAT THERE'D BE TERM LIMITS TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'VE GOT SOME SERVICE ON THAT BOARD SOME EXPERTISE SO THEY CAN EDIT MAKING DECISIONS SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE.

SIX PARTIES QUALIFYING THROUGH VOTER REGISTRATION ONLY ONE QUALIFYING THROUGH THE PETITION PROCESS THEY FAILED THE STATE QUALIFIED FOR SUBSEQUENT ELECTIONS WHEN THEY FEEL THE REGISTER ENOUGH VOTERS THIS BILL WOULD REDUCE THE NUMBER OF SIGNATURES NEEDED ON A PETITION TO FORM A NEW POLITICAL PARTY FROM 10% 23% PUTTING CALIFORNIA IN LINE WITH THE VAST MAJORITY OF OTHER STATES IN THE ASSEMBLY LECTIONS COMMITTEE. RESEARCHING THIS ISSUE WE FOUND THAT MOST STATES ARE BETWEEN A TWO AND 5% THIS BILL ALSO SEEKS TO FREE IT NAMES A PRIOR UNSUCCESSFUL POLITICAL MOVEMENTS BY ALLOWING A NEW PROVIDER REGISTER WITH THE NAME HAS BEEN ABANDONED FOR MORE THAN TWO YEARS REGISTRATIONS FROM PRIOR EFFORTS WOULD ONLY COUNT TOWARDS THE NEW EFFORT OF THE LATTER BODY HAS A SIGNED AFFIDAVIT AFFIDAVITS FROM THE FORMER THAN THE LATTER BODY REPRESENTS THE SAME PLATFORM OTHERWISE PRIOR PRIOR PARTY REGISTRATIONS WOULD NOT COUNT THE NEW BODY ONCE ABANDONED BY THE PRIOR EFFORTS. I LASTLY THIS BILL FORMALIZE THE SECRETARY OF STATE APPEALS PROCESS WHEN APPLYING FOR A PARTY NAME AND JUST DIDN'T- THE TO END HERE I WANT TO THANK AT THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE- DOCTOR SHIRLEY WEBER AND ALL OF HER STAFF ON WORKING WITH ME ON THIS- WE ACTUALLY TOOK SUBSTANTIAL SUBSTANTIAL- IN THE ASSEMBLY AND- I DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER- ANY WITNESSES AND- IN SUPPORT I'M VERY HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER WE WILL.

SENATOR NEWMAN THANK YOU MISTER SO ASSEMBLY RANGE AS YOU NOTED ONE OF THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF THE ADOPTION OF THE- TOP TWO OPEN PRIMARY pSYSTEM IS GUY IT DID NOT HAVE WHAT. I THINK SOME OF THE- FAMILIES HAD IN MIND WHICH WAS TO GIVE THE SPACE AND OPPORTUNITIES TO THIRD PARTIES OR SMALLER PARTIES. RISER PROJECT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE BUT I IF YOU WOULD CAN CAN YOU GIVE ME JUST A LITTLE MORE CONTEXT YOU KNOW AS TO. THE IMPETUS IN ORIGINS OF THE BILL. SURE I DON'T KNOW IT QUITE FRANKLY WHERE- WHAT WHERE TO START I'M PART OF THIS WAS- LOTS OF CONVERSATIONS INITIALLY- WITH THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE- I HAD BEEN. THERE IS A POLITICAL PARTYOR POLITICAL BODY SHOULD SAY- THAT HAD REACHED OUT TO ME. I WITH SOME DIFFERENT IDEAS AND SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE WAY THAT. A THAT THE PROCESS THE PROCESS WORKS AND ASKED IF I COULD COULD COULD HELP OUT TO RESULT THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE. I'VE HAD SEVERAL CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM- AND AT THE END OF ALL OF IT THIS IS WHAT WE ENDED UP- COME COMING UP WITH. A THERE ARE A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT WAYS OF BEING ABLE TO FORM. A POLITICAL PARTY ACTUALLY HAS JUST TWO WAYS TO BE ABLE TO FORM A POLITICAL PARTY YOU CAN EITHER. GO OUT AND- AND YOU COLLECT REGISTRATIONS. OR YOU CAN GO OUT AND GET FOLKS TO BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY JUST SIGNED UP THIS TO THIS BILL ACTUALLY. SAYS THAT INSTEAD OF 10% THEY WOULD BE. OF THREE PERCENT. I'VE LEARNED A SENSE- A SENSE THAT CONVERSATION- THAT- WHEN YOU DO REGISTRATIONS- AFFECTED THERE WAS A BILL THAT YOU ARE CARRYING SENATOR- THAT ACTUALLY DEALT WITH THAT VERY THING AND- THAT WAS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT BECAUSE- YOU YOU HAVE. THIS THIS ISSUE WHEN YOU'RE GOING OUT ASKING PEOPLE TO SIGN UP TO BE ABLE TO CHANGE THE REGISTRATION- IT'S A FRAUD- CAN BECOME BECOME VERY EASY. THE OTHER THING IS IN REGARDS TO THE IN THIS CONVERSATION THE SECRETARY STATE REGARD. SEVEN NAMES- IT SEEMED PRETTY CLEAR THAT THE STATE. STATE NEEDED SOMEHOW. NOT DEALING WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A POLITICAL BODY FORMS. BUT THEN DOESN'T DISBAND THEY DON'T COLLECT ENOUGH SIGNATURES ENOUGH REGISTRATIONS. TO BE ABLE TO BECOME A POLITICAL PARTY- AND THEY NEEDED AN END DATE- OF FOR THAT SO THAT'S THAT'S THE IMPETUS OF. OF THAT LANGUAGE SO ON THAT THE TENTO THREE- THAT WAS THE ONE ON THE SECOND PART. WAS DEALING WITH- WITH WITH WITH THAT THE NAME CHANGE. TICKETS ARE AT THE TIME. MAKES SENSE BUT IT IS HIS DUTY TO WHAT EXTENT IS THIS ADDRESS THAT LARGER PROBLEM OF PARTICIPATION ARE INFLUENCED BY THE THIRD PARTY GROUPS IF AT ALL I'VE BEEN PERHAPS IT DOES WELL IF I'M THE WAY I TALK WAY ALLOWS HEM TO GO FROM I MEAN FORMS THAT THEY ON'T HAVE TO COLLECT AS MANY- AS A THAT'S- THAT THAT WOULD BE BE GOOD AND ALSO AGAIN CLARIFIES. WHAT WILL BE OF SOMEBODY FILES A NAME- THEN IT PROVIDES THE END DATE FOR THAT OKAY THANK YOU THE OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. A C.

ALL RIGHT THAT BRINGS US TO OUR LAST ITEM ON OUR AGENDA ITEM NUMBER SIX. ASSEMBLY BILL FOURTEEN NINETY FIVE BY ASSEMBLY WOMAN RIVAS. SEE THAT YOU ARE HERE WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR TESTIMONY. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. I WANT TO BEGIN BY THANKING YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR THOROUGH EVALUATION OF THIS BILL. AND FOR WORKING WITH MY OFFICE ON AMENDMENTS. CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF FORTY FIVE STATE. THAT ALLOWS ITS GOVERNOR TO APPOINT A PERSON TO FILL A VACANCY IN THE U. S. SENATE. WHEN A VACANCY OCCURS. EARLY IN A SIX YEAR SENATE TERM THAT APPOINTEE SERVICE UNTIL AN ELECTION IS HELD. TO SELECT THE PERSON WHO SERVES THE REMAINDER OF THE TERM. EARLIER THIS YEAR. THEN SENATOR KAMILLA HARRIS RESIGNED HER U. S. SENATE SEAT IN ADVANCE OF BEING INAUGURATED AS VICE PRESIDENT. THAT RESIGNATION CREATED A VACANCY IN CALIFORNIA'S REPRESENTATION IN THE U. S. SENATE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THIRTY YEARS AND TRIGGERED A RE EXAMINATION OF CALIFORNIA'S LAWS. FOR FILLING SUCH VACANCIES SINCE THE LAST VACANCY OCCURRED IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE TO APPELLATE COURTS ISSUE DECISIONS THAT RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER CALIFORNIA'S. U. S. SENATE VACANCY PROCEDURES ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE SEVENTEENTH AMENDMENT TO THE U. S. CONSTITUTION. IN PARTICULAR IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER STATE LAW ALLOWING AN APPOINTEE TO HOLD OFFICE FOR THE REMAINDER. OF THE SENATE TERM UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES COMPLIES WITH THE SEVENTEENTH AMENDMENT. AB FOURTEEN NINETY FIVE WILL ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA LAW IS CONSISTENT WITH THE SEVENTEENTH AMENDMENT TO THE U. S. CONSTITUTION BY PROVIDING FOR AN ELECTION TO BE HELD. FOR THE VACANCY AND CALIFORNIA'S REPRESENTATION IN THE U. S. SENATE EVEN IF THE VACANCY OCCURS DURING THE LAST TWO YEARS OF THE U. S. SENATE TERM. IN ORDER TO AVOID THE COSTS AND DISRUPTIONS OF STANDALONE STATEWIDE SPECIAL ELECTIONS. AB FOURTEEN NINETY FIVE REQUIRES U. S. SENATE VACANCY ELECTIONS TO BE CONSOLIDATED. WITH REGULARLY SCHEDULED STATEWIDE ELECTIONS. IF THE TIMING OF THE VACANCY DOES NOT ALLOW U. S. SENATE VACANCY ELECTION TO BE CONSOLIDATED. WITH THE LAST. STATEWIDE PRIMARY AND GENERAL ELECTION HELD DURING THAT TERM. AB FOURTEEN NINETY FIVE ESTABLISHES A PROCEDURE FOR THE GOVERNOR TO SCHEDULE A SPECIAL PRIMARY AND GENERAL. ELECTION FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE TERM IF IT IS PRACTICAL TO DO SO. L. A. COUNTY IS CURRENTLY PILOTING A PROJECT USING AN ALTERNATE BALLOT ORDER WHERE LOCAL OFFICES APPEAR ON THE BALLOT BEFORE STATE AND FEDERAL OFFICE. IT'S UNCLEAR HOW THIS WOULD IMPACT PARTICIPATION WHEN A SPECIAL VACANCY ELECTION AND REELECTION WOULD APPEAR ON THE SAME BALLOT BUT IN DIFFERENT LOCATIONS. AB FOURTEEN NINETY FIVE WILL ENSURE THAT WHEN A SPECIAL VACANCY ELECTION AND A REGULAR ELECTION FOR THE SAME LEGISLATIVE OR CONGRESSIONAL SEAT APPEAR ON THE SAME BALLOT THAT VOTERS. WILL BE WILL BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY AND UNDERSTAND THIS BY PLACING THE TWO ELECTIONS AT THE FRONT OF THE BALLOT WITH CLEARLY CLEARLY MARKED HADER'S. TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL I HAVE MELISSA ROMERO FROM THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF CONSERVATION VOTERS. VERY GOOD THANK YOU ASSEMBLY WOMAN WILL GO TO YOUR LEAD WITNESS IN SUPPORT MISTER AMERO YOU'RE ON THE PHONE LINES YOU'RE LOOKING TO BEGIN. GOOD MORNING IT MELISSA ROMERO THE CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION VOTERS HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF AB FOURTEEN NINETY FIVE. NOT ONLY IS THIS AN IMPORTANT OPEN A FACT THAT CALIFORNIA LINE YOU'VE GOT TO COMPLIANCE WITH THE U. S. CONSTITUTION. SO OFTEN SURE THAT WHENEVER THERE IS A VACANCY IN THE U. S. SENATE. CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCESS TO DEMOCRACY AND AVOID CONFLICT THEN FOUND IN THE U. S. SENATE. AND REPRESENTATION BUT CALIFORNIANS IN THE SENATE THE CRITICAL DECISION THAT ALL VOTERS IN CALIFORNIA TEACHER PAKISTAN ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT CALIFORNIA STILL ONLY HAS CHIU SENATORS REPRESENTING OUR STATE IN THE LAST MINUTE BUT BY OUR ENORMOUS ABILITY COMPARED TO MUCH SMALLER STATE YOU ALSO. HAVE MINUTES. AND THE U. S. SENATE IS NOT MUCH MORE IMPORTANT FOR EACH OF THE VOTER. COULD PRIORITIZE MY- ACCESS. TO PATIENT COULD A LACK. BY NEARLY. ONE HAVE MUCH HIGHER PARTICIPATION RATE AND INCLUDING A LOT AT BUT IT'S MUCH MORE OF A- OF THE STATE POPULAR. THANK WIDE SPECIAL ELECTION. PROTECT WHEN IT TO AGE AND RACIAL RIGHT. I WOULD. A LOT COULD BE HELD FILL THEIR- OF THE U. S. SENATE. MAKING CURRENT AND PROVIDE NETWORK. IN THE CASE IT'S NOT TO HOLD THE- BEFORE THAT TO AND- BELIEVE WE CAN FIVE IN. HOW DO NOT GO OUT PERFECTLY. IN THE U. S. CALIFORNIA INCOME WITH THE S. CONSTITUTION. AND KNOCKING THE VOTER. BY HOLDING VACANCY. I THINK TIME OF REGULAR SCHEDULED STATEWIDE PRIMARY AND ELECTIONS WHENEVER POSSIBLE. THERE DIRECTION AT THE STATE TIME AS REGULAR CADILLAC. ENSURE THAT THERE'S AMPLE UP BUT TO BE EDUCATED ON THEIR OPTIONS PROMOTING WHAT ABOUT THE CANADA. AND THE CANDIDATES LEAD WITH THE ELECTRIC AND GOLLY REASON. AB FORTY FIVE ON THE TO COMMITTEE I. THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK VERY MUCH AND ROMERO.

SO BRING THE MATTER BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS SENATOR NEWMAN. THANK YOU MISTER SERVICE ASSEMBLY MEMBER RISKY TO SEE YOU. KNOW I DO HAVE A QUESTION AS THE COMMISSION ELSE'S NOTES THERE THERE THERE ARE. IN QUESTION ABOUT VOTER CONFUSION- SPECIFICALLY WHERE YOU'RE HAVING TO KERN ALEXION'S TO FILL. THE REMAINDER THE GERMAN AND ALSO THE IT THE SAME TIME THE ELECTION FOR THE- FOR THE PRIMARY GUESTS- FOR WHAT WOULD BE THE REGULAR TERMS TO WHICH WE HAVE SOME EXPERIENCE WITH THAT RECENTLY THERE WAS A- IT WAS IN THE SENATE ELECTION FOR. US SENATE DISTRICT THIRTY TWO- WHERE EXACTLY THIS SCENARIO TOOK PLACE AND IT WAS CLEAR. THAT THE VOTERS WERE. A GOOD ASPECT. THAT CHECKED RECORD SIR THE IT WAS CLEAR TO ME FROM THE RESULT THE THAT THE VOTERS. EITHER WERE CONFUSED MANAGING. OF WILL BE ONE PERSON GOT ELECTED FOR A VERY SHORT TERM OF SOMETHING LIKE TWO MONTHS. AND AT THE SAME TIME THAT SAME PERSON DID NOT QUALIFY- TO MOVE THROUGH. INTO THE GENERAL THOUGHT HAVING FAILED- IN THE CURRENT PRIMARY SO. WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT- BECAUSE DID YOU KNOW DID IT IS CONFUSING AND YOU MIGHT WIND UP WITH. SOMETHING LIKE THE OPPOSITE OF THE INTENDED RESULT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION SENATOR. I WAS IN THAT SAME SITUATION AND MY ELECTION I WAS ON THE BALLOT TWICE- HI. I RAN TO FILL AN UNEXPIRED TERM. FROM MY PREDECESSOR THAT RESIGNED- AND YOU KNOW IT WAS A LOT OF WORK TO GET PEOPLE TO VOTE. TWICE AND YOU KNOW I UNFORTUNATELY WAS SUCCESSFUL YOU MENTIONED THE CASE OF SENATE DISTRICT THIRTY TO WEAR. TWO DIFFERENT CANDIDATES ONE ONE THE SPECIAL ONE ONE THE- OF THE REGULAR ELECTION. I THINK. IF WE WORK TOWARDS IT YOU KNOW IT I THINK IT'S UP TO EACH CANDIDATE TO WORK. TOWARD ELIMINATING THAT CONFUSION- BUT IN THIS CASE- WE NEED TO DO THIS BECAUSE IT BECAUSE OF THAT- YOU KNOW WE WANT. THE SPECIAL AND THE REGULAR TO BE ON THE SAME BALLOT WE COULD END UP. WITH THE REMAINDER OF AN EGG UNEXPIRED TERM ON FILLED. UNTIL YOU KNOW FROM BETWEEN NOVEMBER AND JANUARY- WHILE I AGREE WITH YOU THAT IT. IT CAN CONFUSE VOTERS. WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT CALIFORNIA IS REPRESENTED. IN THE U. S. SENATE. EVEN FOR THAT SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME. AND WE DON'T WANT ANYTHING. TO BE VAGUE. OR FOR US NOT TO LIKE I SAID NOT TO HAVE. A REPRESENTATIVE. AT THE U. S. SENATE. THE AVERAGE I GUESS I GUESS YOU'RE OF THE DAY THE TRAY OFF VERY VERSES- YOU KNOW HAVING MATURITY OF SOMEBODY IN THAT OFFICE- DOUG I WOULD.
