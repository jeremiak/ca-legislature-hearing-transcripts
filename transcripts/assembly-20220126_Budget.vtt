COMMENTS ON THE GOVERNOR'S MAJOR

00:44:12.850 --> 00:44:15.319
PROPOSALS AND THEN A BRIEF WORD

00:44:15.386 --> 00:44:16.587
ON THE BUDGET CONDITION AND

00:44:16.653 --> 00:44:18.022
RESERVES THROUGHOUT THOSE

00:44:18.088 --> 00:44:20.624
COMMENTS I THINK YOU'LL SEE A

00:44:20.691 --> 00:44:21.625
THEME EMERGE THAT WE ENCOURAGE

00:44:21.692 --> 00:44:23.060
YOU TO KEEP IN MIND HOW TO

00:44:23.127 --> 00:44:24.261
PRESERVE LEGISLATIVE

00:44:24.328 --> 00:44:26.764
FLEXIBILITY. AND HOW TO CONTINUE

00:44:26.830 --> 00:44:28.432
TO STRENGTHEN THE STATE'S FISCAL

00:44:28.499 --> 00:44:29.700
RESILIENCE ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT

00:44:29.767 --> 00:44:32.403
OF THE ONGOING UNCERTAINTY

00:44:32.469 --> 00:44:35.105
RELATED TO THE PANDEMIC RISING

00:44:35.172 --> 00:44:36.140
AND- VARIOUS OTHER CHALLENGES

00:44:36.206 --> 00:44:38.275
THAT ARE OUT THERE. AND I JUST

00:44:38.342 --> 00:44:39.777
YOU KNOW WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

00:44:39.843 --> 00:44:42.146
RESILIENCE AND RESERVES I'D LIKE

00:44:42.212 --> 00:44:43.914
TO UNDERSCORE THAT IT'S NOT FOR

00:44:43.981 --> 00:44:46.016
THEIR OWN SAKE IT'S NOT FOUR OR

00:44:46.083 --> 00:44:47.651
OR AN ABSTRACT NOTION OF FISCAL

00:44:47.718 --> 00:44:49.653
PRUDENCE. IT'S SO THAT THE STATE

00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:51.321
CAN REMAIN IN A STRONG POSITION

00:44:51.388 --> 00:44:52.823
TO UPHOLD THE COMMITMENTS THAT

00:44:52.890 --> 00:44:54.124
THE LEGISLATURE HAS MADE

00:44:54.191 --> 00:44:56.060
PREVIOUSLY. AND SO THAT THE

00:44:56.126 --> 00:44:58.062
STATE CAN SUSTAIN VITAL PROGRAMS

00:44:58.128 --> 00:44:59.096
IN THE EVENT OF ANOTHER

00:44:59.163 --> 00:45:02.332
UNEXPECTED SHOCKER DOWNTURNS. SO

00:45:02.399 --> 00:45:04.535
IS THAT ALL JUMPED INTO THE TO

00:45:04.601 --> 00:45:07.638
THE HAND OUT HERE MOVING TO PAGE

00:45:07.704 --> 00:45:10.374
ONE- THE FIGURE ON THE FIRST

00:45:10.441 --> 00:45:12.276
PAGE. HERE DISPLAYS HOW THE

00:45:12.342 --> 00:45:13.343
GOVERNOR ALLOCATES THE

00:45:13.410 --> 00:45:15.646
DISCRETIONARY SURPLUS AS YOU

00:45:15.712 --> 00:45:17.648
KNOW WE RUN OUR OWN CALCULATIONS

00:45:17.714 --> 00:45:18.916
AND WE FOUND THAT THE GOVERNOR

00:45:18.982 --> 00:45:19.883
HAD ACCORDING TO OUR

00:45:19.950 --> 00:45:21.285
MEASUREMENTS AT TWENTY NINE

00:45:21.351 --> 00:45:23.487
BILLION DOLLAR DISCRETIONARY

00:45:23.554 --> 00:45:25.155
SURPLUS TO ALLOCATE. THIS IS

00:45:25.222 --> 00:45:27.391
SOMEWHAT HIGHER THAN THE TWENTY

00:45:27.458 --> 00:45:28.559
ONE BILLION IN DISCRETIONARY

00:45:28.625 --> 00:45:30.094
SURPLUS IDENTIFIED BY THE

00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:32.529
ADMINISTRATION. NOW SINCE WE

00:45:32.596 --> 00:45:34.498
BOTH BOTH OF OUR OFFICES

00:45:34.565 --> 00:45:36.100
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IN LA-

00:45:36.166 --> 00:45:39.503
FOLLOW. SIMILAR METHODOLOGY FOR

00:45:39.570 --> 00:45:41.271
CALCULATING THE SURPLUS I'LL

00:45:41.338 --> 00:45:43.207
POINT OUT THAT WHERE WE DIFFER

00:45:43.273 --> 00:45:47.211
IS THAT IN- SOME OF THE SOME OF

00:45:47.277 --> 00:45:49.279
THE ITEMS THAT WE COUNT AS

00:45:49.346 --> 00:45:51.381
DISCRETIONARY SPENDING WHICH

00:45:51.448 --> 00:45:53.016
MEANS IT CONTRIBUTES TO THE

00:45:53.083 --> 00:45:55.219
SURPLUS. THE ADMINISTRATION

00:45:55.285 --> 00:45:57.287
COUNTS AS PART OF THE STATE'S

00:45:57.354 --> 00:45:58.956
EXISTING SPENDING BASE SO FOR

00:45:59.022 --> 00:46:01.191
EXAMPLE IN NOTABLE ONE IS WE

00:46:01.258 --> 00:46:03.427
CONSIDER THE THREE AND A HALF

00:46:03.494 --> 00:46:04.995
BILLION OR SO- PROPOSED

00:46:05.062 --> 00:46:06.797
TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURES

00:46:06.864 --> 00:46:09.867
SPENDING- IN THAT PACKAGE AS

00:46:09.933 --> 00:46:11.301
DISCRETIONARY. THUS INCREASING

00:46:11.368 --> 00:46:13.203
THE SURPLUS BY THAT MUCH IN THAT

00:46:13.270 --> 00:46:14.638
WHERE IS THE ADMINISTRATION

00:46:14.705 --> 00:46:16.507
INCLUDED THAT AS PART OF THE

00:46:16.573 --> 00:46:18.876
SPENDING BASELINE. SO WHILE THE

00:46:18.942 --> 00:46:20.444
ADMINISTRATION'S APPROACH IS

00:46:20.511 --> 00:46:23.013
REASONABLE. WE CAN OUT- SUCH

00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:24.615
AMOUNTS AS PART OF DISCRETIONARY

00:46:24.681 --> 00:46:27.284
SURPLUS OUT OF DEFERENCE TO YOU

00:46:27.351 --> 00:46:28.652
IN THE LEGISLATURE IN OTHER

00:46:28.719 --> 00:46:30.954
WORDS FOR US IT'S NOT JUST A

00:46:31.021 --> 00:46:32.990
TECHNICAL ACCOUNTING DIFFERENCE.

00:46:33.056 --> 00:46:37.327
OUR APPROACH YOUR RECOGNIZES IN

00:46:37.394 --> 00:46:37.961
ORDER SPENDING. THE LEGISLATURE

00:46:38.028 --> 00:46:39.329
MUST MAKE AN APPROACH. MUST

00:46:39.396 --> 00:46:41.331
APPROPRIATE THE FUNDS FIRST SO

00:46:41.398 --> 00:46:44.401
YOU MAY DECIDE THAT YOU CHOOSE

00:46:44.468 --> 00:46:46.103
TO END IT HERE TO THESE PREVIOUS

00:46:46.170 --> 00:46:47.871
AGREEMENTS THAT ARE REFLECTED IN

00:46:47.938 --> 00:46:48.906
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL BUT IT'S

00:46:48.972 --> 00:46:51.808
STILL A CHOICE ON YOUR PART. AND

00:46:51.875 --> 00:46:52.676
THAT'S WHY WE RECOGNIZE IT AS

00:46:52.743 --> 00:46:56.079
SUCH. SO WHEN I TURNED TO THE

00:46:56.146 --> 00:46:58.182
TWO FIGURES ON THE SLIDE- THE

00:46:58.248 --> 00:46:59.750

00:50:27.457 --> 00:50:29.693
BEFORE ME. THE MAIN REASON FOR

00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:30.994
THAT IS THAT DELAYING THE

00:50:31.061 --> 00:50:33.430
FORMATION OF THE PLAN REDUCES

00:50:33.497 --> 00:50:35.399
LEGISLATIVE FLEXIBILITY. FOR

00:50:35.465 --> 00:50:38.101
INSTANCE IF REVENUES CONTINUE TO

00:50:38.168 --> 00:50:39.736
OUTPACE BUDGET ESTIMATES IN THE

00:50:39.803 --> 00:50:41.738
LEGISLATURE PREFERRED TO ADDRESS

00:50:41.805 --> 00:50:44.074
A PORTION OF THE OF THE

00:50:44.141 --> 00:50:45.776
REQUIREMENT COMING FROM FROM THE

00:50:45.842 --> 00:50:48.011
CELL BY LOWERING TAXES. AND

00:50:48.078 --> 00:50:49.546
REALLY EARLIER ACTION WOULD BE

00:50:49.613 --> 00:50:51.815
BETTER THAN WAITING UNTIL MAY IN

00:50:51.882 --> 00:50:55.051
ORDER FOR IT TO AFFECT YOU EIGHT

00:50:55.118 --> 00:50:56.653
THAT TYPE OF THE POLICY. AS WE

00:50:56.720 --> 00:51:00.457
LOOK TO THE TWENTY TWENTY.

00:51:00.524 --> 00:51:01.057
TWENTY TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE

00:51:01.124 --> 00:51:02.459
BUDGET YEAR. THE GOVERNOR'S

00:51:02.526 --> 00:51:05.228
PROPOSAL REFLECTS ROOM OF ABOUT

00:51:05.295 --> 00:51:07.264
WERE UNDER THE LIMIT BY ABOUT

00:51:07.330 --> 00:51:10.534
FIVE POINT SEVEN BILLION- AND

00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:12.102
HERE AGAIN WE WOULD NOTE THAT

00:51:12.169 --> 00:51:13.570
THERE ARE AROUND TWELVE BILLION

00:51:13.637 --> 00:51:14.938
IN PROPOSALS THAT REDUCED

00:51:15.005 --> 00:51:16.540
REVENUES ARE APPROPRIATIONS

00:51:16.606 --> 00:51:18.241
SUBJECT TO THE LIMIT SO THAT'S

00:51:18.308 --> 00:51:20.243
VERY IMPORTANT- PART OF THE-

00:51:20.310 --> 00:51:22.946
OVERALL PROPOSAL. TAKING IT IN

00:51:23.013 --> 00:51:25.048
ITS TOTALITY THERE IT YOU KNOW

00:51:25.115 --> 00:51:27.017
AND LOOKING AT THE TWENTY NINE

00:51:27.083 --> 00:51:28.018
BILLION DOLLAR SURPLUS THE

00:51:28.084 --> 00:51:30.086
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL HAS ABOUT

00:51:30.153 --> 00:51:31.154
SEVENTEEN BILLION DOLLARS IN

00:51:31.221 --> 00:51:32.923
PROPOSALS THAT ADDRESS CELL

PROPOSAL'S NOT ADDRESSING CELL

00:51:40.030 --> 00:51:42.165
THE CELL REQUIREMENTS ARE NOT

00:51:42.232 --> 00:51:43.767
EXCLUDABLE FROM THE CELL. THESE

00:51:43.834 --> 00:51:45.068
INCLUDE EIGHT POINT FIVE BILLION

00:51:45.135 --> 00:51:47.370
IN- IN SPENDING AND THEN THREE

00:51:47.437 --> 00:51:49.139
POINT ONE BILLION THAT GOES TO

00:51:49.206 --> 00:51:52.209
THE S. S. B. U. WHICH IS AS WE

00:51:52.275 --> 00:51:54.644
NOTED BEFORE IT DOES NOT- IS NOT

00:51:54.711 --> 00:51:56.379
EXCLUDABLE FROM THE CELL JUST

00:51:56.446 --> 00:51:57.781
YOU KNOW IT'S JUST GOING INTO

00:51:57.848 --> 00:52:00.183
THE S. AND P. YOU SEE. WHAT THIS

00:52:00.250 --> 00:52:01.818
ALL MEANS IS THAT IF YOU WEIGH

00:52:01.885 --> 00:52:03.053
YOUR CHOICES ON THE GOVERNOR'S

00:52:03.119 --> 00:52:06.056
PROPOSALS BROADLY SPEAKING ARE

00:52:06.122 --> 00:52:07.858
IN ORDER TO KEEP APPROPRIATIONS

00:52:07.924 --> 00:52:10.961
BELOW THE LIMIT IN TWENTY TO

00:52:11.027 --> 00:52:12.028
TWENTY TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE.

00:52:12.095 --> 00:52:14.564
ANY OF THE SEVENTEEN BILLION YEN

00:52:14.631 --> 00:52:17.133
SALIX MOVABLE PROPOSALS- THAT

00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:18.502
THEY GOT THAT THE LEGISLATURE

00:52:18.568 --> 00:52:21.204
OPTS TO REJECT REALLY MUST BE

00:52:21.271 --> 00:52:23.173
REPLACED BY ANOTHER ALLOCATION.

00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:26.610
THAT IS SELL EXCLUDABLE ALSO.

00:52:26.676 --> 00:52:29.446
I'M SORRY KIND OF WHITE IT TO

00:52:29.513 --> 00:52:30.914
THE BIG. ESSENTIALLY ON THE

00:52:30.981 --> 00:52:32.816
OTHER HAND ANY OF THE TWELVE

00:52:32.883 --> 00:52:34.584
BILLION THAT ARE NOT EXCLUDABLE

00:52:34.651 --> 00:52:36.152
. UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL

00:52:36.219 --> 00:52:37.621
IF THE LEGISLATURE WERE WERE TO

00:52:37.687 --> 00:52:39.523
REJECT SOME OF THOSE YOU COULD

00:52:39.589 --> 00:52:41.291
REPLACE THOSE WITH OTHER NOT

00:52:41.358 --> 00:52:43.593
EXCLUDABLE- ALLOCATIONS

00:52:43.660 --> 00:52:45.262
WARRICK'S WILL DOUBLE ALLOCATION

00:52:45.328 --> 00:52:47.097
SO IN A WAY HAVE MORE

00:52:47.163 --> 00:52:48.064
FLEXIBILITY WITH THAT SUCH THAT

00:52:48.131 --> 00:52:56.506
SIDE OF THE- TOTAL- THEN. ALL

00:52:56.573 --> 00:52:58.008
RIGHT LET ME JUST TURN BRIEFLY

00:52:58.074 --> 00:53:02.913
HERE TO THE- COMMENTS WE HAVE ON

00:53:02.979 --> 00:53:04.180
THE GOVERNOR'S SPENDING

00:53:04.247 --> 00:53:06.950
PROPOSALS OVERALL WE THINK THAT

00:53:07.017 --> 00:53:08.919
THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO KEEP

00:53:08.985 --> 00:53:10.086
IN MIND THE MAGNITUDE OF LAST

00:53:10.153 --> 00:53:11.321
YEAR'S COMMITMENTS AND DEDICATE

00:53:11.388 --> 00:53:12.956
SOME PORTION OF THE EARLY PART

00:53:13.023 --> 00:53:14.190
OF THE BUDGET PROCESS TO

00:53:14.257 --> 00:53:15.559
CHECKING IN ON THE

00:53:15.625 --> 00:53:16.993
IMPLEMENTATION OF THOSE CHOICES.

00:53:17.060 --> 00:53:19.829
JULY IN SOMEWHAT CONSISTENT WITH

00:53:19.896 --> 00:53:21.398
REMARKS MADE BY THE CHAIR AND

00:53:21.464 --> 00:53:22.532
VICE CHAIR IN THE OPENING

00:53:22.599 --> 00:53:25.201
STATEMENTS RELATED TO THIS WE

00:53:25.268 --> 00:53:26.603
RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE

00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:28.405
BE CAUTIOUS ABOUT CREATING NEW

00:53:28.471 --> 00:53:29.973
PROGRAMS WE'RE SIGNIFICANTLY

00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:33.310
EXPANDING EXT EXISTING ONES. WE

00:53:33.376 --> 00:53:34.578
THINK IT MAY BE APPROPRIATE TO

00:53:34.644 --> 00:53:37.113
BE YOU THE ONGOING PANDEMIC IN

00:53:37.180 --> 00:53:39.149
AS AS A LONG TERM ISSUE AND

00:53:39.215 --> 00:53:40.584
CONSIDER THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE

00:53:40.650 --> 00:53:42.986
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS RECOGNIZED.

00:53:43.053 --> 00:53:46.957
THIS POTENTIAL REALITY. THE NEXT

00:53:47.023 --> 00:53:48.224
TWO PAGES I'M NOT GOING TO GO

00:53:48.291 --> 00:53:51.061
THROUGH IN DETAIL AT ALL- BUT

00:53:51.127 --> 00:53:52.329
THEY REALLY ARE JUST A LISTING

00:53:52.395 --> 00:53:54.364
OF SOME OF THE MAJOR PROPOSALS

00:53:54.431 --> 00:53:55.799
AND SOME OF OUR- ADDITIONAL

00:53:55.865 --> 00:53:58.935
COMMENTS ON THOSE AND WE'VE BEEN

00:53:59.002 --> 00:54:00.570
. STARTING TO GET OUT OUR

00:54:00.637 --> 00:54:02.205
ANALYSIS ON VARIOUS OF THESE NOW

00:54:02.272 --> 00:54:04.174
BUT YOU'D SEE UNDER EACH OF THE

00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:07.277
PROPOSED. MAJOR PROPOSALS THAT.

00:54:07.344 --> 00:54:08.578
SOME OF OUR COMMENTS REALLY YOU

00:54:08.645 --> 00:54:11.414
KNOW IT ECHO THE THEMES THAT

00:54:11.481 --> 00:54:13.116
I'VE BEEN MENTIONING. SO IF YOU

00:54:13.183 --> 00:54:14.517
LOOK AT K. FOURTEEN EDUCATION

00:54:14.584 --> 00:54:17.287
FOR EXAMPLE. THIS SCHOOLS AND

00:54:17.354 --> 00:54:18.955
COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE ALREADY

00:54:19.022 --> 00:54:20.757
IMPLEMENTING MANY NEW PROGRAMS

00:54:20.824 --> 00:54:27.330
AND REQUIREMENTS IN. SO IT'S YOU

00:54:27.397 --> 00:54:28.898
KNOW THEIR CAPACITY TO IMPLEMENT

00:54:28.965 --> 00:54:30.333
EVEN MORE NEW PROGRAMS IS

00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:33.837
PROBABLY LIMITED. WE RECOMMEND

00:54:33.903 --> 00:54:36.306
THEREFORE FUNDING FEWER OF THE

00:54:36.373 --> 00:54:38.241
NEW ONE TIME PROGRAMS IN

00:54:38.308 --> 00:54:40.243
PARTICULAR IN PRIORITIZING THOSE

00:54:40.310 --> 00:54:42.479
TO DRESS YOUR PRIORITIES AND THE

00:54:42.545 --> 00:54:43.980
UNDERLYING PROBLEMS THAT THAT

00:54:44.047 --> 00:54:46.916
CANNOT BE ADDRESSED WITH WITH

00:54:46.983 --> 00:54:52.255
EXISTING PROGRAMS. AND TO SO

00:54:52.322 --> 00:54:54.090
THOSE ARE THE TWO PAGES ON THE

00:54:54.157 --> 00:54:56.626
MAJOR PROPOSALS MERIT JUST LIKE

00:54:56.693 --> 00:54:58.662
TO CLOSE ON THE LAST TWO PAGES

00:54:58.728 --> 00:54:59.896
YOU'RE MENTIONING OUR VIEWS ON

00:54:59.963 --> 00:55:01.364
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AS IT

00:55:01.431 --> 00:55:02.465
RELATES TO THE STATE'S OVERALL

00:55:02.532 --> 00:55:04.901
BUDGET CONDITION. YOU MAY RECALL

00:55:04.968 --> 00:55:07.103
IN RECENT PREVIOUS YEARS WE'VE

00:55:07.170 --> 00:55:08.872
DESCRIBED THE ADMINISTRATION'S

00:55:08.938 --> 00:55:10.507
REVENUE ESTIMATES AS POSSIBLE

00:55:10.573 --> 00:55:12.776
THOUGH A BIT CAUTIOUS RELATIVE

00:55:12.842 --> 00:55:15.111
TO OURS. NOW IN THE GOVERNOR'S

00:55:15.178 --> 00:55:16.880
BUDGET THE REVENUE ESTIMATES ARE

00:55:16.946 --> 00:55:18.715
MUCH HIGHER THAN BEFORE OVER THE

00:55:18.782 --> 00:55:21.351
THREE YEAR BUDGET WINDOW- THAT

00:55:21.418 --> 00:55:23.119
YOU KNOW IS CONSIDERED. THE

00:55:23.186 --> 00:55:24.387
ADMINISTRATION HAS RAISED

00:55:24.454 --> 00:55:26.423
REVENUE ESTIMATES BY FORTY ONE

00:55:26.489 --> 00:55:28.692
BILLION FROM THE BUDGET ACT AND

00:55:28.758 --> 00:55:30.627
AT THIS POINT THERE ARE MUCH

00:55:30.694 --> 00:55:32.362
CLOSER TO WHAT WE WOULD CONSIDER

00:55:32.429 --> 00:55:34.998
THAT MEDIAN LIKELIHOOD OUTCOME

00:55:35.065 --> 00:55:38.301
OR MIDDLE OF THE ROAD SCENARIO.

00:55:38.368 --> 00:55:41.438
AND SO YOU KNOW WHILE WELL THESE

00:55:41.504 --> 00:55:42.472
ESTIMATES ARE REASONABLE THEY'RE

00:55:42.539 --> 00:55:44.708
CLOSE TO OURS YOU KNOW SO WE

00:55:44.774 --> 00:55:47.077
THINK THEY'RE REASONABLE- THE

00:55:47.143 --> 00:55:49.546
YOU KNOW THE FACT IS BY BY USING

00:55:49.612 --> 00:55:50.847
A HIGHER REVENUE ESTIMATE

00:55:50.914 --> 00:55:52.582
THERE'S JUST LESS LIKELIHOOD FOR

00:55:52.649 --> 00:55:54.851
AN UPSIDE ADJUSTMENT- UPSIDE

00:55:54.918 --> 00:55:57.587
REVISION LATER ON SUCH AS

00:55:57.654 --> 00:55:59.489
SOMETHING TO BE COGNIZANT OF.

00:55:59.556 --> 00:56:00.957
AND THIS IS ACTUALLY REALLY

00:56:01.024 --> 00:56:02.392
BECOMES IMPORTANT WHEN WE BEGAN

00:56:02.459 --> 00:56:03.793
LOOKING THROUGH TO THE

00:56:03.860 --> 00:56:06.663
ADMINISTRATION'S. MULTI YOU'RE A

00:56:06.730 --> 00:56:09.499
GENERAL FUND FORECAST BECAUSE IT

00:56:09.566 --> 00:56:11.167
THE MULTI YEAR FORECAST SHOWS

00:56:11.234 --> 00:56:13.903
NEGATIVE STFU BALANCES. YEAH

00:56:13.970 --> 00:56:16.740
AND- BEGINNING IN TWENTY TWENTY

00:56:16.806 --> 00:56:18.108
THREE TWENTY FOUR AND FOR THE

00:56:18.174 --> 00:56:19.209
REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST TO

00:56:19.275 --> 00:56:20.443
RISE AND SO ESSENTIALLY THIS

00:56:20.510 --> 00:56:22.612
MEANS THAT- THE ADMINISTRATION

00:56:22.679 --> 00:56:24.481
SPENDING PROPOSALS EXCEED ITS

00:56:24.547 --> 00:56:26.182
OWN ESTIMATES OF THE STATE'S

00:56:26.249 --> 00:56:27.951
FUTURE BUDGET CAPACITY. AND SO

00:56:28.017 --> 00:56:32.122
THAT'S- YOU KNOW STE. ONE

00:56:32.188 --> 00:56:35.692
COMMENT. FINALLY ON THE FINAL

00:56:35.759 --> 00:56:38.128
PAGE HERE WE DO HAVE A COMMENT

00:56:38.194 --> 00:56:40.764
ON RESERVES FIRST I WILL JUST

00:56:40.830 --> 00:56:42.298
POINT OUT HAT WE DIFFERENTIATE

00:56:42.365 --> 00:56:43.333
BETWEEN THE GENERAL PURPOSE

00:56:43.399 --> 00:56:44.701
RESERVES WHICH AS I SAID AT THE

00:56:44.768 --> 00:56:46.736
BEGINNING IT INCLUDES THAT THE

00:56:46.803 --> 00:56:48.638
BUDGET STABILIZATION ACCOUNT.

00:56:48.705 --> 00:56:50.707
THE SFU IN THE STICKING OUT

00:56:50.774 --> 00:56:52.208
RESERVE WE DIFFERENTIATE THAT

00:56:52.275 --> 00:56:53.643
GROUP FROM THE PROP NINETY EIGHT

00:56:53.710 --> 00:56:55.445
RESERVE. WELL THE PROP NINETY

00:56:55.512 --> 00:56:56.946
EIGHT RESERVE IS VERY HELPFUL

00:56:57.013 --> 00:56:58.314
FOR MAINTAINING EDUCATION

00:56:58.381 --> 00:57:00.383
FUNDING IN A DOWN YEAR THOSE

00:57:00.450 --> 00:57:01.684
BALANCES REALLY WOULD NOT BE

00:57:01.751 --> 00:57:04.220
AVAILABLE TO HELP ADDRESS A

00:57:04.287 --> 00:57:05.989
BUDGET PROBLEM SO WE DON'T THINK

00:57:06.055 --> 00:57:09.592
OF THEM AS GENERALLY AVAILABLE

00:57:09.659 --> 00:57:10.760
FOR GENERAL PURPOSE IN THAT SAME

00:57:10.827 --> 00:57:13.096
WAY. AND WHO AS WE LOOK AT THE

00:57:13.163 --> 00:57:15.598
TOTAL OF THE GENERAL PURPOSE

00:57:15.665 --> 00:57:16.699
RESERVE THAT ABOUT TWENTY FIVE

00:57:16.766 --> 00:57:19.769
BILLION. NOMINALLY THAT'S VERY

00:57:19.836 --> 00:57:21.938
HIGH HISTORICALLY HIGH BUT WHEN

00:57:22.005 --> 00:57:23.840
YOU LOOK AT THEM AS A SHARE OF

00:57:23.907 --> 00:57:26.409
THE BUDGET WHICH I THINK IS THE

00:57:26.476 --> 00:57:27.043
IMPORTANT WAY TO LOOK AT THEM

00:57:27.110 --> 00:57:29.445
THEY WOULD REMAIN SOMEWHAT BELOW

00:57:29.512 --> 00:57:31.514
PRE PANDEMIC LEVELS. AND SO FOR

00:57:31.581 --> 00:57:35.652
THAT REASON WE DO THINK THAT. IT

00:57:35.718 --> 00:57:36.186
WARRANT YOUR CONSIDERATION

00:57:36.252 --> 00:57:39.422
ACCORDING. TO GET MORE INTO THE

00:57:39.489 --> 00:57:40.790
GENERAL PURPOSE RESERVES ON AN

00:57:40.857 --> 00:57:44.027
OPTIONAL BASIS. SO I'LL STOP

00:57:44.093 --> 00:57:47.363
THERE AND BE HAPPY TO RESPOND TO

00:57:47.430 --> 00:57:49.566
ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE

00:57:49.632 --> 00:57:50.733
. GREAT THANK YOU NOW WE'RE

00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:52.702
GOING TO TURN OVER TO THE

00:57:52.769 --> 00:57:53.903
COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE

00:57:53.970 --> 00:58:01.044

THERE AGAINST THAT'S THE SENATE.

00:58:35.044 --> 00:58:36.980
OF TIME WITH THE REVENUE

00:58:37.046 --> 00:58:41.684
PROJECTIONS AND WHAT THE BUT THE

00:58:41.751 --> 00:58:43.419
GOVERNOR PRESS FOR POST. WELL I

00:58:43.486 --> 00:58:45.321
THINK THERE'S JUST A CONCERN IN

00:58:45.388 --> 00:58:48.224
THE SENSE THAT- YOU KNOW THE

00:58:48.291 --> 00:58:50.526
MULTI YEAR FORECAST SHOULD

00:58:50.593 --> 00:58:53.196
REPRESENT OUR- BEST ESTIMATES OF

00:58:53.263 --> 00:58:54.297
WHAT WE THINK THE FUTURE HOLDS

00:58:54.364 --> 00:58:56.232
AND SO IF THE MULTI YEAR

00:58:56.299 --> 00:58:58.401
FORECAST IS SHOWING NOT JUST AN

00:58:58.468 --> 00:59:01.237
OPERATING DEFICIT. WHERE CURRENT

00:59:01.304 --> 00:59:03.606
YEAR REVENUES. PRINT YOUR

00:59:03.673 --> 00:59:04.908
EXPENDITURES BUT ACTUALLY A

00:59:04.974 --> 00:59:08.745
NEGATIVE SFC YOU BALANCE. HELLO

00:59:08.811 --> 00:59:10.280
THAT'S ACTUALLY A BUDGET THAT

00:59:10.346 --> 00:59:12.482
YOU WOULD BE ALLOWED TO PASS

00:59:12.548 --> 00:59:14.584
UNDER THE CONSTITUTION'S OUR

00:59:14.651 --> 00:59:16.452
BALANCED BUDGET REQUIREMENT SO

00:59:16.519 --> 00:59:18.388
WHAT IT SAYS TO ME IS THAT

00:59:18.454 --> 00:59:20.189
THERE'S WE'RE WE'RE STARTING OFF

00:59:20.256 --> 00:59:21.925
FROM A PLACE WHERE WE ASSUME

00:59:21.991 --> 00:59:23.793
THAT THERE WILL BE A CHANGE FROM

00:59:23.860 --> 00:59:25.929
THE CURRENT FORECAST THAT EITHER

00:59:25.995 --> 00:59:27.864
REVENUES WILL BE HIGHER. OR

00:59:27.931 --> 00:59:30.466
EXPENDITURES WILL BE LOWER AND

00:59:30.533 --> 00:59:33.069
THAT'S CERTAINLY POSSIBLE- BUT

00:59:33.136 --> 00:59:34.637
AS I SAID THE REVENUES HAVE BEEN

00:59:34.704 --> 00:59:36.606
ADJUSTED UPWARD WHICH IS VERY

00:59:36.673 --> 00:59:39.075
REASONABLE BUT IT JUST MEANS

00:59:39.142 --> 00:59:42.545
THAT THERE'S LESS- THE CONTROL

00:59:42.612 --> 00:59:43.746
FOR AN ADDITIONAL UPSIDE

00:59:43.813 --> 00:59:45.448
REVISION AFTER YOU'VE ALREADY

00:59:45.515 --> 00:59:50.019
MOVED THEM UP TO MORE OF THIS.

00:59:50.086 --> 00:59:52.455
MEDIA AND LIKELIHOOD OUT. SO

00:59:52.522 --> 00:59:55.124
YEAH I THINK I THINK THAT'S-

00:59:55.191 --> 00:59:58.027
WHAT I WOULD SAY TO THAT MR FONG

00:59:58.094 --> 00:59:58.828
THAT'S SPOKEN LIKE A TRUE

00:59:58.895 --> 01:00:01.931
ANALYST HE GIVEN A LOT OF WORDS

01:00:01.998 --> 01:00:04.834
ON THAT ONE- AB. S. AS

01:00:04.901 --> 01:00:06.636
ESSENTIALLY THERE'S A LOT OF

01:00:06.703 --> 01:00:08.071
ASSUMPTIONS AND WE NEED TO BE I

01:00:08.137 --> 01:00:11.007
GUESS THE BROADER I GUESS THE

01:00:11.074 --> 01:00:12.775
CONCLUSION IS THAT YOU WANT YOU

01:00:12.842 --> 01:00:14.777
WOULD RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE

01:00:14.844 --> 01:00:16.679
MAINTAIN SOME FLEXIBILITY.

01:00:16.746 --> 01:00:18.948

THE ADMINISTRATION HAS TAKEN A

01:01:53.109 --> 01:01:54.710
COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO WATER

AS WE GET MORE SPECIFICS BUT HAS

01:17:27.342 --> 01:17:28.610

EVIDENT- I DON'T KNOW THAT

01:17:58.673 --> 01:17:59.975
THERE'S BEEN AN ANALYSIS ON THE

01:18:00.042 --> 01:18:02.544
POTENTIAL COST TO BUSINESS- IT.

01:18:02.611 --> 01:18:04.079
IN TERMS OF WEIGHING THE

01:18:04.146 --> 01:18:06.648
BENEFITS OF NOT HAVING TO. COME

AWARE. OKAY THE AND THE REASON

01:18:28.804 --> 01:18:30.772
WHY I ASK IS THAT I THINK WHEN

WE ORIGINALLY DISCUSSED THE-

01:18:32.541 --> 01:18:34.709

THERE WAS A FEDERAL TAX CREDIT-

01:18:36.244 --> 01:18:38.113
IN PLACE AND I THINK THAT HAS

01:18:38.180 --> 01:18:39.481
EXPIRED. AND SO I'M I'M JUST

01:18:39.548 --> 01:18:41.583

01:19:25.660 --> 01:19:27.462
FOR WATER STORAGE IN THE BUDGET

01:19:27.529 --> 01:19:29.798
OKAY SO IS THERE ANYTHING FOR

01:19:29.865 --> 01:19:32.434
ANY NEW WATER INTO THE STATE'S

01:19:32.501 --> 01:19:40.475
SYSTEM. IF I'M UNDERSTANDING

01:19:40.542 --> 01:19:45.046
YOUR QUESTION CORRECTLY- NOW

01:19:45.113 --> 01:19:46.081
ALTHOUGH THE FUNDING THAT'S

01:19:46.148 --> 01:19:48.083
INCLUDED IN THE DROUGHT PACKAGE

01:19:48.150 --> 01:19:49.484
THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION- ARE

01:19:49.551 --> 01:19:54.756
VERY S. WATER CONSERVATION- AT

01:19:54.823 --> 01:19:56.525
PROJECTS AS THAT'S THE THING

01:19:56.591 --> 01:19:58.160
ABOUT GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT

01:19:58.226 --> 01:19:59.394
URBAN AND SMALL COMMUNITY

01:19:59.461 --> 01:20:01.596
DROUGHT RELIEF LEON REPURPOSE

01:20:01.663 --> 01:20:04.633
SCENE- INSULATING. PERFORMERS SO

01:20:04.699 --> 01:20:06.601
THERE'S NOT ANY THE BIGGEST

01:20:06.668 --> 01:20:07.702
PROBLEM WE HAVE GOING INTO

01:20:07.769 --> 01:20:11.239
ANOTHER DROUGHT IS THAT. THE

01:20:11.306 --> 01:20:12.841
FUNCTION IN MY AREA IN THE

01:20:12.908 --> 01:20:15.210
SILICON VALLEY DON'T HAVE WATER

01:20:15.277 --> 01:20:16.711
THEY'RE HAVING TO CUT DEALS WITH

01:20:16.778 --> 01:20:18.580
WITH OTHER AREAS TO MOVE WATER

01:20:18.647 --> 01:20:20.282
TO DO THESE DIFFERENT THINGS.

01:20:20.348 --> 01:20:22.484
AND WITHOUT ANY NEW WATER INTO

01:20:22.551 --> 01:20:25.554
THE SYSTEM. THE CITIES ARE GONNA

01:20:25.620 --> 01:20:28.590
GO DRY THIS IS A JUST- IN AG

01:20:28.657 --> 01:20:29.824
ISSUE THIS IS THE FACT THAT WE

01:20:29.891 --> 01:20:33.428
HAVE. DISADVANTAGE HI IMMIGRANT

01:20:33.495 --> 01:20:38.266
COMMUNITIES THAT AGAIN DO NOT

01:20:38.333 --> 01:20:41.903
HAVE ACCESS. TO CLEAN RELIABLE

01:20:41.970 --> 01:20:47.609
WATER. SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE THAT

01:20:47.676 --> 01:20:48.343
THAT WE DO GET SOMETHING IN

01:20:48.410 --> 01:20:50.879
THERE FOR MORE WATER INTO THE

01:20:50.946 --> 01:20:54.482
SYSTEM- BECAUSE FRANKLY OUR

01:20:54.549 --> 01:20:56.918
PEOPLE CAN'T DRINK DOLLARS SO

01:20:56.985 --> 01:20:58.853
IT'S NICE TO SAY WE'RE GOING TO

01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:00.355
PUT. MONEY IN INTO THE BUDGET

01:21:00.422 --> 01:21:02.057
FOR DROUGHT BUT IF THAT MONEY

01:21:02.123 --> 01:21:04.326
DOESN'T COME WITH WATER. IT IT

01:21:04.392 --> 01:21:06.795
DOESN'T HELP SO WE NEED TO WORK

01:21:06.861 --> 01:21:08.897
ON THAT THANK YOU. IT IF I COULD

01:21:08.964 --> 01:21:11.333
JUST CLARIFY TEO- SO THERE THERE

01:21:11.399 --> 01:21:13.902
IS IN TERMS OF. ADDING KIND OF

01:21:13.969 --> 01:21:16.838
WATER AS STORAGE A MOTHER ISN'T

01:21:16.905 --> 01:21:18.640
SPECIFICALLY FUNDING FOR ABOVE

01:21:18.707 --> 01:21:20.742
GROUND WATER STORAGE- BEYOND

01:21:20.809 --> 01:21:22.344
THAT THE EXISTING PROPOSITION

01:21:22.410 --> 01:21:25.146
ONE FUNDING THERE IS FUNDING-

01:21:25.213 --> 01:21:26.381
FOR AT SUSTAINABLE GROUNDWATER

01:21:26.448 --> 01:21:28.850
MANAGEMENT SO UNDERGROUND WATER

01:21:28.917 --> 01:21:31.253
STORAGE- WHICH WHICH HAS.

01:21:31.319 --> 01:21:33.188
CONSIDERABLY MORE CAPACITY THAN

01:21:33.255 --> 01:21:34.456
WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ABOVE

01:21:34.522 --> 01:21:36.591
GROUND STORAGE SO- IN TERMS OF

01:21:36.658 --> 01:21:38.526
THAT COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH AND

01:21:38.593 --> 01:21:39.628
CONJUNCTIVE USE WHICH IS

01:21:39.694 --> 01:21:41.263
SOMETHING THAT- THE

01:21:41.329 --> 01:21:42.697
ADMINISTRATION CONTINUES TO

01:21:42.764 --> 01:21:44.599
SUPPORT AS A MORE. SUSTAINABLE

01:21:44.666 --> 01:21:46.401
LONG TERM APPROACH TO WATER

01:21:46.468 --> 01:21:48.370
AVAILABILITY- THERE IS THERE IS

01:21:48.436 --> 01:21:51.239
FUNDING- FOR GROUNDWATER.

THE SOLUTION TO ADDRESSING

01:24:31.466 --> 01:24:32.901

01:24:43.745 --> 01:24:45.680
SCHOOLS. THAT THEY'VE HAD OVER

01:24:45.747 --> 01:24:47.148
TWO HUNDRED STUDENTS IN THE LAST

01:24:47.215 --> 01:24:49.484
SIX MONTHS AND THEY NEED TO GET

THE FUNDING TO CARRY ON NOT GO

01:24:51.286 --> 01:24:52.854

TO BE THE FUNDING RIGHT NOW

01:24:56.491 --> 01:24:57.859
BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE LEAVING THE-

01:24:57.926 --> 01:24:59.694
SURGICAL DRESSING SHUT DOWN

01:24:59.761 --> 01:25:01.229
CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE OPEN REAL

THEY GET THE FUNDING FOR THESE

01:25:06.701 --> 01:25:07.802
CHILDREN. SURE OF MOVING FORWARD

01:25:07.869 --> 01:25:11.673
FROM TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. INTO

01:25:11.739 --> 01:25:13.041
TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE AND

01:25:13.107 --> 01:25:14.909
ONGOING- THE CHARTER SCHOOLS

01:25:14.976 --> 01:25:17.011
WOULD BE FUNDED AT CURRENT YEAR-

01:25:17.078 --> 01:25:18.680
AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE SO THAT

01:25:18.746 --> 01:25:20.582
THOSE THAT ARE GROWING ARE BEING

01:25:20.648 --> 01:25:21.883
FUNDED. YOU DON'T HAVE A

01:25:21.950 --> 01:25:25.320
PROPOSAL IN THIS BUDGET IN

01:25:25.386 --> 01:25:26.387
TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE TO

01:25:26.454 --> 01:25:33.928
CHANGE THAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OKAY THANK THANK YOU MISTER

01:25:33.995 --> 01:25:35.663
CHAIR AND I'LL BE BRIEF BECAUSE

01:25:35.730 --> 01:25:36.865
I KNOW WE'RE GOING TO DISCUSS A

01:25:36.931 --> 01:25:38.600
LOT OF THE CENTER SUBCOMMITTEES

01:25:38.666 --> 01:25:40.635
BUT AS THAT YOU'RE BROUGHT UP IN

01:25:40.702 --> 01:25:41.903
THE BLUEPRINT WHICH I KNOW HE

01:25:41.970 --> 01:25:43.905
HAD A STRONG HAND AND THERE WAS-

01:25:43.972 --> 01:25:45.006
THE ASSEMBLY BLUEPRINT BLUEPRINT

01:25:45.073 --> 01:25:46.140
HAD A TEN BILLION FOR SCHOOL

01:25:46.207 --> 01:25:48.142
FACILITIES AND THAT'S A GREAT

01:25:48.209 --> 01:25:50.311
WAY. TO INVEST IN INFRASTRUCTURE

01:25:50.378 --> 01:25:51.412
BECAUSE OUR SCHOOL FACILITY

01:25:51.479 --> 01:25:52.580
PROGRAM IS ESSENTIALLY OUT OF

01:25:52.647 --> 01:25:56.417
MONEY- SO THAT THAT THAT THAT

01:25:56.484 --> 01:25:58.286
NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED IN AGAIN

01:25:58.353 --> 01:25:58.887
USING SOME OF THOSE- ONE TIME

01:25:58.953 --> 01:26:00.755
MONIES TO ADDRESS OUR

01:26:00.822 --> 01:26:01.789
INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS ACROSS THE

01:26:01.856 --> 01:26:04.259
STATE IN OUR SCHOOLS WOULD BE A

01:26:04.325 --> 01:26:04.859
VERY VALUABLE THING INVESTMENT

01:26:04.926 --> 01:26:09.297
IN OUR FUTURE- AND I THINK THIS

01:26:09.364 --> 01:26:10.765
IS. THIS IS SOMEWHAT LINKED TO-

01:26:10.832 --> 01:26:12.500
TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM US VERY-

01:26:12.567 --> 01:26:14.903
COMMENTS- ALL ARTICULATED OVER

01:26:14.969 --> 01:26:16.704
MANNER AND THAT IS THAT THE BASE

01:26:16.771 --> 01:26:18.840
NEEDS TO BE MUCH HIGHER THE BASE

01:26:18.907 --> 01:26:20.108
ALLOCATION LIMIT THE GOVERNOR

01:26:20.174 --> 01:26:21.376
HAS FILE- HE'S PROPOSED A FIVE

01:26:21.442 --> 01:26:23.811
POINT 33% DJUSTMENT THAT'S

01:26:23.878 --> 01:26:25.647
UPWARD TO THE BASE ALLOCATION IT

01:26:25.713 --> 01:26:28.116
NEEDS TO BE PROBABLY DOUBLE PLUS

01:26:28.182 --> 01:26:28.917
THAT QUITE FRANKLY. DUE TO

01:26:28.983 --> 01:26:31.185
INFLATION DUE TO DECLINING

01:26:31.252 --> 01:26:32.554
ENROLLMENT AND DUE TO STUDENT

01:26:32.620 --> 01:26:35.123
NEEDS AND ALSO THIS IS NOT A

01:26:35.189 --> 01:26:36.658
YEAR TO BE CREATING A LOT OF NEW

01:26:36.724 --> 01:26:37.759
PROGRAMS. SCHOOLS NEED TO BE

01:26:37.825 --> 01:26:39.394
OPEN THEIR STRESS TEACHERS ARE

01:26:39.460 --> 01:26:40.962
STRESSING MINISTRY DISTRESS

01:26:41.029 --> 01:26:43.331
STUDENT SUCCESS- IT'S NOT A YEAR

01:26:43.398 --> 01:26:44.732
WHERE WE NEED TO DESIGN A BUNCH

01:26:44.799 --> 01:26:46.267
OF PROGRAMS AT SCHOOLS YOU KNOW

HINDRANCE TO USING- TECHNOLOGY

01:48:21.828 --> 01:48:23.763
COMPONENTS FOR SOME OF THAT

01:48:23.830 --> 01:48:24.764
FUNDING THAT THAT. COULD BE

01:48:24.831 --> 01:48:31.338
OFFERED TO LOCAL JURISDICTIONS.

01:48:31.404 --> 01:48:32.873
YEAH I'M NOT SURE THERE'S ANY

01:48:32.939 --> 01:48:34.574
LIMITATIONS OR RESTRICTIONS ON

01:48:34.641 --> 01:48:36.743
THAT- USAGE OF THE FUNDING I'LL

01:48:36.810 --> 01:48:39.279
TURN THAT QUESTION TO JUSTIN IT

01:48:39.346 --> 01:48:41.081
AMEND IT TO CONFIRM NOT. GOOD

01:48:41.147 --> 01:48:42.048
AFTERNOON JUST NAY NEWMAN

01:48:42.115 --> 01:48:43.383
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE RIGHT NOW

01:48:43.450 --> 01:48:44.751

01:48:44.818 --> 01:48:46.353
ABOUT YOU NO EXCLUSIONS FOR WHAT

01:48:46.419 --> 01:48:48.588
THE EIGHTY DAY. NINETY FIVE

01:48:48.655 --> 01:48:50.290
MILLION ANNUALLY- FOR VARIOUS

01:48:50.357 --> 01:48:53.560
GRANTS. BE PUT TOWARDS- SO

01:48:53.627 --> 01:48:54.794
THERE'S NO EXCLUSION RIGHT NOW

01:48:54.861 --> 01:48:57.063
ON WHAT CAN BE USED FOR. THANK

01:48:57.130 --> 01:48:58.865
THANK YOU FOR THAT AND THE

01:48:58.932 --> 01:48:59.733
REASON I BRING THAT UP IS

01:48:59.799 --> 01:49:02.068
BECAUSE THEY USE THE TECHNOLOGY-

01:49:02.135 --> 01:49:08.375
WHAT WITH. ONE HIGHER- OFFICERS

01:49:08.441 --> 01:49:09.976
AND DEPUTIES IS ONE THING BUT

01:49:10.043 --> 01:49:12.078
UTILIZING ONE TIME MONEY FOR

01:49:12.145 --> 01:49:14.915
TECHNOLOGY- IN PARTICULAR MAYBE

01:49:14.981 --> 01:49:16.716
SOME OTHER AREAS SUCH AS GPS

01:49:16.783 --> 01:49:18.852
TRACKERS THAT COULD- FOLLOW SOME

01:49:18.919 --> 01:49:20.253
OF THOSE RETAIL THEFTS AND

01:49:20.320 --> 01:49:20.854
MAKING SURE THAT WERE

01:49:20.921 --> 01:49:22.455
APPREHENDED. THOSE INDIVIDUALS

01:49:22.522 --> 01:49:24.691
THAT ARE THERE SO I WANT TO PUT

01:49:24.758 --> 01:49:26.793
THAT IN- TE DISCUSSION BECAUSE

01:49:26.860 --> 01:49:28.194
A LOT OF TIMES WHEN PEOPLE SEE

01:49:28.261 --> 01:49:29.763
THE MONEY AND FUNDING GOING

01:49:29.829 --> 01:49:31.398
TOWARDS LAW ENFORCEMENT IT

01:49:31.464 --> 01:49:33.566
EQUATES TO- NEW DEPUTIES ARE NEW

01:49:33.633 --> 01:49:34.868
OFFICERS ON THE STREET BUT OF

01:49:34.935 --> 01:49:36.803
ITS ONE TIME FUNDING. IT COULD

01:49:36.870 --> 01:49:39.005
BUT IT PUTS SOME OF THE LOCAL

01:49:39.072 --> 01:49:39.973
JURISDICTIONS IN A BIND FOR

01:49:40.040 --> 01:49:41.641
FUTURE FUNDING TO KEEP THOSE-

01:49:41.708 --> 01:49:43.643
MEMBERS- WITHIN THE FOREST BT

01:49:43.710 --> 01:49:44.945
ONE TIME MONEY GOING TOWARDS

01:49:45.011 --> 01:49:47.013
TECHNOLOGY. IS AN AREA THAT I

01:49:47.080 --> 01:49:49.683
WOULD LOVE TO EXPLORE AND TO-

01:49:49.749 --> 01:49:51.484
COME UP WITH SOME DIFFERENT

01:49:51.551 --> 01:49:52.118
IDEAS ON HOW WE CAN ACTUALLY

01:49:52.185 --> 01:49:54.654
CREATE- A PULL- THAT WE COULD

01:49:54.721 --> 01:49:56.189
PULL MONEY AND GRANTS FOR

01:49:56.256 --> 01:50:00.060
TECHNOLOGY USE WERE BATTLING.

01:50:00.126 --> 01:50:01.728
AREAS SUCH AS RETAIL THEFT. I

01:50:01.795 --> 01:50:04.097
WOULD LOVE TO WORK WITH- WITH

MUCH TIME HE SHAVED OFF AND- AT

01:53:38.811 --> 01:53:41.047
THE END BUT IT DOES HELP REDUCE

01:53:41.114 --> 01:53:43.683
RATES- WHAT IT HELPS THE STATE

01:53:43.750 --> 01:53:46.619
AS WELL AS EMPLOYERS. IN THE

01:53:46.686 --> 01:53:48.621
LONG TERM. SO IT WAS A ROUGHLY

01:53:48.688 --> 01:53:50.156
WEAKENED IF THE L. A. L. O.

01:53:50.223 --> 01:53:52.125
WANTS TO WIN HERE I MEAN COULD

01:53:52.192 --> 01:53:54.694
WE LOOK AT IF PAYING IT DOWN AT

01:53:54.761 --> 01:53:55.695
THIS RATE OF YOU KNOW TWO

01:53:55.762 --> 01:53:56.796
BILLION APPROXIMATELY A YEAR.

01:53:56.863 --> 01:54:00.500
BUT IT TAKES ABOUT A DECADE.

01:54:00.567 --> 01:54:04.304
YES- THIS IS GAVE PATRICK

01:54:04.370 --> 01:54:07.540
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST AND- ESCHEN

01:54:07.607 --> 01:54:09.509
WITH THE AMOUNT BEING PROPOSED.

01:54:09.576 --> 01:54:13.580
IF IT WERE CONTINUE TO. YOU KNOW

01:54:13.646 --> 01:54:15.348
SIMILAR AMOUNTS WENT FORWARD IN

01:54:15.415 --> 01:54:16.749
THE FUTURE I THINK WE'RE LOOKING

01:54:16.816 --> 01:54:18.651
AT SOMETHING THAT THE TOWARD THE

01:54:18.718 --> 01:54:21.120
END OF THE DECADE SEEKS. DEBT

01:54:21.187 --> 01:54:23.323
WOULD BE PAID DOWN BUT UNDER THE

01:54:23.389 --> 01:54:26.993
FEDERAL RULES AS YOU NOTED THE-

01:54:27.060 --> 01:54:29.462
THE EMPLOYERS WOULD BE SUBJECT

01:54:29.529 --> 01:54:32.098
TO AT YOU KNOW ZERO POINT 3% TAX

01:54:32.165 --> 01:54:34.367
INCREASE ON THEIR PAYROLL TAXES

01:54:34.434 --> 01:54:36.169
UNTIL THE TIME WHEN IT'S PAID

01:54:36.236 --> 01:54:39.172
DOWN SO. IF THE LEGISLATURE WERE

01:54:39.239 --> 01:54:40.740
INTERESTED IN PROVIDING MORE

01:54:40.807 --> 01:54:42.942
IMMEDIATE RELIEF THERE MIGHT BE

01:54:43.009 --> 01:54:44.811
OTHER OTHER ALTERNATIVE STATE

01:54:44.877 --> 01:54:48.815
WOULD WANT TO CONSIDER- AS

01:54:48.881 --> 01:54:49.949
OPPOSED TO THIS APPROACH. SO

01:54:50.016 --> 01:54:51.417
LAST YEAR THEY ADMINISTER

01:54:51.484 --> 01:54:52.719
MINISTRATION OF KNOWLEDGE THAT

01:54:52.785 --> 01:54:55.221
WE WOULD HAVE TO PAY DOWN DEBT-

01:54:55.288 --> 01:54:56.189
ON THE BACKS OF SMALL BUSINESS

01:54:56.256 --> 01:54:58.591
UNLESS WE- INVESTED MORE IN PAIN

01:54:58.658 --> 01:55:00.059
THIS DOWN ESPECIALLY WITH THESE

01:55:00.126 --> 01:55:01.828
ONE TIME SURPLUS DOLLARS THAT WE

01:55:01.894 --> 01:55:04.364
HAVE. SO WHAT IF WE'RE ONLY

01:55:04.430 --> 01:55:06.032
ALLOCATING GONNA ONE BILLION

01:55:06.099 --> 01:55:08.001
THIS YEAR TWO BILLION NEXT YEAR.

01:55:08.067 --> 01:55:10.036
WHEN WOULD YOU WANT ONE WITH THE

01:55:10.103 --> 01:55:11.371
ADMINISTRATION ANTICIPATE THAT

01:55:11.437 --> 01:55:13.039
BUSINESSES WOULD START TO SEE AN

01:55:13.106 --> 01:55:22.115
INCREASE IN THEIR E. Y. PAYMENTS. YES SO AS- MISTER PEDICLE

01:55:22.181 --> 01:55:24.651
SAYING THAT FOR EVERY YEAR THERE

01:55:24.717 --> 01:55:26.786
IS A BALANCE. OR SOME DEBT

01:55:26.853 --> 01:55:28.321
REMAINING IN A STATE THAT THE

01:55:28.388 --> 01:55:30.023
EMPLOYERS THAT PAY INTO THE

01:55:30.089 --> 01:55:32.191
TRUST FUND WOULD NOT SEE THAT

01:55:32.258 --> 01:55:35.028
CREDIT. AND SO THEY WOULD FEEL-

01:55:35.094 --> 01:55:38.364
INCREASED. COST OF STARTING NEXT

01:55:38.431 --> 01:55:41.167
YEAR JANUARY. THANK YOU I. I

01:55:41.234 --> 01:55:44.470
JUST LOOK AT THE OVER TWENTY TWO

01:55:44.537 --> 01:55:45.071
THOUSAND BUSINESSES THAT WERE

01:55:45.138 --> 01:55:47.173
PROBABLY CLOSE IN THE STATE. AND

01:55:47.240 --> 01:55:50.043
pARE STILL STRUGGLING AND I JUST

01:55:50.109 --> 01:55:52.745
HOPE THAT THAT WE CAN REALLY-

01:55:52.812 --> 01:55:54.080
PROVIDE SOME RAL REPRIEVE FOR

01:55:54.147 --> 01:55:56.449
THEM- AND ENSURE THAT WE'RE

01:55:56.516 --> 01:55:57.750
SUPPORTING THEM WHEN THEY NEED

01:55:57.817 --> 01:56:00.153
IT MOST THEY'VE BEEN HERE FOR US

01:56:00.219 --> 01:56:01.220
WHEN. WE NEED TO BE THERE FOR

01:56:01.287 --> 01:56:03.256
THEM. MY NEXT QUESTION IS AROUND

01:56:03.323 --> 01:56:06.459
AND- THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET

01:56:06.526 --> 01:56:09.128
PROVIDES EIGHT HUNDRED AND

01:56:09.195 --> 01:56:09.996
TWENTY THREE POINT SEVEN MILLION

01:56:10.063 --> 01:56:11.831
DOLLARS TO ADD THIRTY SIX

01:56:11.898 --> 01:56:12.865
THOUSAND SUBSIDIZED CHILD CARE

01:56:12.932 --> 01:56:15.301
SLOTS ON TOP OF THE ONE HUNDRED

01:56:15.368 --> 01:56:17.437
AND TEN THOUSAND THAT WERE

01:56:17.503 --> 01:56:18.438
FUNDED IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO

01:56:18.504 --> 01:56:19.839
BUDGET PACKAGE. I'M MOVING

01:56:19.906 --> 01:56:21.441
TOWARD THE GOAL OF ADDING A

01:56:21.507 --> 01:56:23.643
TOTAL OF TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND

01:56:23.710 --> 01:56:25.445
MORE SLOTS BY TWENTY FIVE TWENTY

01:56:25.511 --> 01:56:27.046
SIX- AND I AM EXCITED ABOUT THIS

01:56:27.113 --> 01:56:29.982
I HAVE SAID YOU KNOW- FROM THE

01:56:30.049 --> 01:56:32.752
GET GO THAT WE CANNOT EXPECT TO

01:56:32.819 --> 01:56:35.254
GET PEOPLE BACK TO WORK IF THEY

01:56:35.321 --> 01:56:35.888
DON'T HAVE CHILD COURT CARE- AND

01:56:35.955 --> 01:56:37.724
I THINK THIS IS EIGHT EIGHT GOAL

01:56:37.790 --> 01:56:39.058
HOWEVER IT'S REALLY UNCLEAR.

01:56:39.125 --> 01:56:41.127
UNCLEAR WHETHER THESE SLOTS CAN

01:56:41.194 --> 01:56:44.263
BE ACCESSED BY FAMILIES MOST

01:56:44.330 --> 01:56:46.232
NEEDED IT WHAT THE CURRENT

01:56:46.299 --> 01:56:48.334
INFRASTRUCTURE SO TO THAT

01:56:48.401 --> 01:56:50.737

IS HAPPENING IN THE FIELD WITH

01:56:56.109 --> 01:56:57.276
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RATE

01:56:57.343 --> 01:56:58.911
INCREASES STIPEND ALLOCATIONS

01:56:58.978 --> 01:57:01.314
AND THE ONE HUNDRED AND TEN- AND

01:57:01.381 --> 01:57:03.182
BUT NEED TO ADD NEW SLOTS THAT

01:57:03.249 --> 01:57:05.051
ARE SUPPOSED TO BE ADDED IN THE

01:57:05.118 --> 01:57:06.853
CURRENT YEAR AND DO WE HAVE AN

01:57:06.919 --> 01:57:09.322
ESTIMATE HOW MANY. SLOTS HAVE

01:57:09.389 --> 01:57:11.991

ANYTHING TO ADD TO THAT. THIS IS

01:57:30.476 --> 01:57:31.377
TYLER WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:57:31.444 --> 01:57:33.146
FINANCE I CAN TAKE THAT PART OF

01:57:33.212 --> 01:57:35.047
THAT QUESTION AT LEAST SO I KNOW

01:57:35.114 --> 01:57:37.750
THAT- MOST OF THE STIPENDS HAVE

01:57:37.817 --> 01:57:39.118

AT THIS POINT I DON'T KNOW IF WE

01:57:48.861 --> 01:57:50.730
HAVE. A NUMBER OF BREAK OUT

01:57:50.797 --> 01:57:54.300
RIGHT NOW ON EXACTLY HOW MANY OF

01:57:54.367 --> 01:57:56.135
THOSE SLOTS ARE ACTIVE. I WOULD

01:58:03.543 --> 01:58:04.877
CHILD CARE FACILITIES I'VE

01:58:04.944 --> 01:58:06.646

01:58:06.712 --> 01:58:07.814
HAVE ANY INSIGHT AS TO WHETHER

01:58:07.880 --> 01:58:09.949
OR NOT. YOU KNOW THAT WE CAN

01:58:10.016 --> 01:58:11.818
ACTUALLY FIELD AND CAN ACTUALLY

01:58:11.884 --> 01:58:12.919
ACCOMMODATE THE THIRTY SIX

01:58:12.985 --> 01:58:14.921
THOUSAND. NEW SLOTS AND THE

01:58:14.987 --> 01:58:17.023
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I DON'T

01:58:17.089 --> 01:58:19.392
SEE ANY ALLOCATION FOR THE WORK

01:58:19.459 --> 01:58:22.094
FORCE FOR CHILD CARE. AND INTO

01:58:22.161 --> 01:58:23.129
ONE OF THE BIGGEST CONCERNS IS

01:58:23.196 --> 01:58:24.931
THAT WERE WERE TWO HUNDRED

01:58:24.997 --> 01:58:25.965
THOUSAND SLOTS AND IT'S REALLY

01:58:26.032 --> 01:58:28.401
HARD TO RECRUIT. SO WHY WOULDN'T

01:58:28.468 --> 01:58:32.572
WE- PUT MONIES TOWARDS

01:58:32.638 --> 01:58:39.245

THINK- TO PARTIALLY ADDRESS YOUR

01:58:47.320 --> 01:58:48.855
QUESTION I THINK THAT'S PART OF

01:58:48.921 --> 01:58:50.756
THE ONGOING DISCUSSION ABOUT

01:58:50.823 --> 01:58:53.326
RATE REFORMS THAT HOPEFULLY. AS

01:58:53.392 --> 01:58:55.261
RATES GET DEVELOPED IN A BETTER

01:58:55.328 --> 01:58:57.763
MORE SINGULAR WAY IN ADDITION TO

01:58:57.830 --> 01:58:59.632
ADDITIONAL FUNDING BUT THAT

01:58:59.699 --> 01:59:01.400
MIGHT BECOME MORE APPEALING AND

01:59:01.467 --> 01:59:03.636
HELP WITH SOME OF THE FIELD. AND

01:59:03.703 --> 01:59:05.171
RECRUITMENT EFFORTS BUT I JUST

01:59:05.238 --> 01:59:06.772
WANT TO ADD THAT THERE WAS

01:59:06.839 --> 01:59:08.407

FUNDING IN THE TWENTY ONE ACT IT

01:59:19.218 --> 01:59:20.620
WAS SUPPOSED TO BE INCENTIVE TO

EVERY MONTH OF GOODS COMING INTO

02:01:40.026 --> 02:01:41.093
THAT PART. AND GOOD TECHNIQUE TO

DO WITH THAT BACKLOG WE'RE NOT

02:02:04.717 --> 02:02:05.384
OVER BURDENING. THE SAME

02:02:05.451 --> 02:02:06.786
COMMUNITIES THAT WE'RE TRYING TO

02:02:06.852 --> 02:02:08.654
SUPPORT WITH OTHER MEASURES IN

02:02:08.721 --> 02:02:09.388
THIS BUDGET- WHETHER THAT'S

02:02:09.455 --> 02:02:10.423
THROUGH ADDITIONAL TRUCKS MOVING

02:02:10.489 --> 02:02:12.391
A BUNCH OF EMPTY CONTAINERS INTO

02:02:12.458 --> 02:02:15.161
MY BACKYARD. AROUND MY BACKYARD.

02:02:15.227 --> 02:02:16.896

WORK WE HAVE TO CLEAN UP SOME OF

02:02:25.571 --> 02:02:27.273
THOSE BROWN FEELS. AND CONVERT

THEM AND SO- ARE THERE ANY

02:02:28.274 --> 02:02:29.575
DETAILS ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO

02:02:29.642 --> 02:02:30.810
ENSURE THAT THAT SAME EQUITY

02:02:30.876 --> 02:02:34.480

YEAR ABOUT DOING SOME

02:06:05.624 --> 02:06:07.960
SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING FOR THOSE-

THEIR FUNDING- JUST BECAUSE OF

02:06:14.066 --> 02:06:15.868
THE WAY THAT WE CALCULATE-

02:06:15.935 --> 02:06:18.070
FUNDS- AND ALSO GOT SHORT

02:06:18.137 --> 02:06:21.206
CHANGED. I WAS SOME OF THE- THE

02:06:21.273 --> 02:06:23.642
CODE FUNDING LAST. LAST YEAR'S

02:06:23.709 --> 02:06:25.811
I'D LIKE TO SEE IF WE COULD DO

02:06:25.878 --> 02:06:26.912
SOME SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING HELP

INFILL INFRASTRUCTURE GRANTS

02:06:35.154 --> 02:06:37.756
PROGRAM GREAT PROGRAM- THERE'S

02:06:37.823 --> 02:06:39.792
ACTUALLY WE GOT SOME FUNDING IN

02:06:39.858 --> 02:06:42.461
CHICO FOR THAT PROGRAM TO- DO

02:06:42.528 --> 02:06:44.330
SOME OF ROAD WIDENING IT WAS

02:06:44.396 --> 02:06:46.532
THERE'S MUCH NEED THAT'S GOING

02:06:46.598 --> 02:06:48.200
TO BRING ON THREE HUNDRED. NEW

02:06:48.267 --> 02:06:50.369
UNITS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. ONE

02:06:50.436 --> 02:06:51.704
PROBLEM WE GOT A SEQUEL LAWSUIT

02:06:51.770 --> 02:06:53.973
RIGHT AFTER WE GOT THE GRANT AND

02:06:54.039 --> 02:06:55.841
THAT IS HOLDING UP. THIS PROJECT

02:06:55.908 --> 02:06:58.077
SO WE'RE GONNA NEED THAT COMBINE

02:06:58.143 --> 02:06:59.645
THAT WITH SOME SEEK REFORM TO

02:06:59.712 --> 02:07:01.280
MAKE SURE THAT THESE

02:07:01.347 --> 02:07:02.381

THE ON THE CLIMATE DISCUSSION. I

02:07:11.156 --> 02:07:13.158
THINK WE REALLY NEED TO FOCUS ON

02:07:13.225 --> 02:07:14.727
THE CARBON CAPTURE TECHNOLOGY

02:07:14.793 --> 02:07:16.829
AND REALLY MAKING INVESTMENTS.

02:07:16.895 --> 02:07:18.864
THERE IT IT TO ME IT STRIKES THE

02:07:18.931 --> 02:07:20.366
PERFECT BALANCE OF PROTECTING

02:07:20.432 --> 02:07:22.701
JOBS IN THIS STATE. AND REACHING

02:07:22.768 --> 02:07:24.937
OUR CLIMATE GOALS AT THE GOT A

02:07:25.004 --> 02:07:26.905
REAL OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT- IF

02:07:26.972 --> 02:07:29.141
WE ALL WORK TOGETHER AND I THINK

02:07:29.208 --> 02:07:30.709
THERE- YOU KNOW OR- EVEN A YOU

02:07:30.776 --> 02:07:32.111
KNOW ALL BALL HIGHLIGHT JUST

02:07:32.177 --> 02:07:33.779
FROM. FROM MY STEP SOMETHING I

02:07:33.846 --> 02:07:36.048
CARE A LOT ABOUT BIOMASS. WE CAN

02:07:36.115 --> 02:07:37.516
CERTAINLY BUILD NEW BIOMASS

02:07:37.583 --> 02:07:38.851
PLANTS WITH CARBON CAPTURE

02:07:38.917 --> 02:07:41.787
TECHNOLOGY- IT CREATES THE CAN

02:07:41.854 --> 02:07:43.756
CREATE HYDROGEN. WE CAN DO THIS

02:07:43.822 --> 02:07:45.157
AND SO MANY DIFFERENT

02:07:45.224 --> 02:07:45.791
APPLICATIONS AND WE REALLY GOT

02:07:45.858 --> 02:07:48.293
TO GET IT RIGHT SO HOPEFULLY WE

02:07:48.360 --> 02:07:50.195
CAN- GET SOME REAL STRONG

02:07:50.262 --> 02:07:53.565
INVESTMENTS ON THAT FRONT AS

02:07:53.632 --> 02:07:55.501
