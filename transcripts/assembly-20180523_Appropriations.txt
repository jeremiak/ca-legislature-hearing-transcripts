AND WITH RESPECT TO MEDICAL EXPENSES FUNERAL ARRANGEMENTS GRIEF COUNSELING THINGS OF THAT NATURE. AND WHILE THIS BILL. CANNOT TAKE AWAY FROM THEM THE LOSS THAT THEY'VE EXPERIENCED. IT CAN PROVIDE AN INCREDIBLE RELIEF FOR FAMILIES. UP IN NEED AND HELP TO REALLY LIFT THE BURDEN. AB TWENTY TO FIFTY NINE PASSED UNANIMOUSLY IN THE ASSEMBLY REVENUE AND TAXATION COMMITTEE. AND I RESPECTFULLY. REQUESTING YOUR SUPPORT DUH WHEN IT ECHOES TO STE SUSPENSE. TESTIFIED TO HAVE THE BILL IS MISTER GAVIN FERGUSON HE AND HIS WIFE WERE FOUNDERS OF THE NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION PHOEBE'S FUND. ALSO WITH THIS IS MRS DURING TO GREGORY WHO IS HERE ON BEHALF OF A LOCAL VOLUNTEER RUN SUPPORT GROUP. SHARING PARENTS OF SACRAMENTO. I THINK YOU'RE JUST WONDERING MY THE WITNESSES YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES EACH AND WE TRY TO KEEP OUR COMMENTS IN THIS COMMITTEE TO. S. CLUBHOUSES. THANK YOU. MY DAUGHTER PHOEBE WAS DUE AUGUST SIXTH TWENTY FIFTEEN AND ON AUGUST ELEVENTH WHICH WAS FIVE DAYS AFTER HER DUE DATE. OUR DOCTOR COULDN'T FIND A HEARTBEAT ON A ROUTINE APPOINTMENT. SHE QUICKLY PULLED HER INTO ANOTHER ROOM WITH AN ULTRASOUND AND STARTED TO LOOK AT OUR DAUGHTER AND AS SOON AS HE HAD HER ON THE SCREEN. WE CAN ALL SEE THAT HER LITTLE HEART WAS NO LONGER BEATING. HE THEN LOOKED AT US AND SAID THE WORST WORDS ANYONE COULD EVER SAY TO A PERSON BUT I'M SORRY BUT YOUR BABY HAS DIED. NO THAT THE LEVEL OF GRIEF FELL FROM PARENTS WHO NEVER GET TO HOLD THEIR BABY HAVE TO LEAVE THE HOSPITAL WITH NOTHING IN THEIR ARMS. LIVE IN A HOUSE WITH AN EMPTY NURSERY THAT THEY BUILT IS A PAIN THAT NO ONE IS EQUIPPED TO HANDLE. AND OFTEN SWELL OF COUPLES HOLE. THIS IS WHY AB TWO TWO FIVE NINE IS SO IMPORTANT. IT'S NOT BAD ENOUGH THE PARENTS HAVE TO SURF THE WAVES OF GRIEF FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES MORNING A CHILD THAT THEY NEVER GET TO WATCH GROW UP. BUT THEY ALSO HAVE TO DEAL WITH UNEXPECTED EXPENSES THAT ADD INSULT TO INJURY FUNERAL COSTS. BURIAL OR CREMATION COSTS WORKING AFTER SOMETHING LIKE THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE. SO THERE'S LACK OF INCOME IN SOME CASES IN SOME COUPLES NEED TO LEAVE THEIR HOUSE OR TOWN FOR A BIT TO COLLECT THEIR THOUGHTS AND BE ALONE. FINALLY THE MOST ROBUST AS MEDICAL EXPENSES TO PAY FOR THE BIRTH OF THE BABY THAT YOU NOW HAVE TO BURY. MY WIFE AND I CREATED A CHARITY CALLED PHOEBE'S FIND THAT GIVES GRANTS TO COUPLES THAT THEY CAN GET THERE BECAUSE. WHICH IS ANOTHER EXPRESSED EXPENSE THE MOST DON'T CONSIDER. IN TWENTY FIFTEEN OUR DAUGHTER PHOEBE ELAINE FERGUSON WAS ONE OF TWENTY SIX THOUSAND STILL PERSON AMERICA AND IT'S FAR MORE COMMON THAN PEOPLE REALIZE THE PARENTS OF THOSE TWENTY SIX THOUSAND. BORN STILL EVERY YEAR NEED HELP. I ENCOURAGE YOU TO PLEASE APPROVED AB TWO TWO FIVE NINE.

AT THAT TIME I WAS TWENTY TWO WEEKS PREGNANT CARRYING MY SECOND CHILD A GIRL.

SHE FURTHER EXPLAINS THAT THE COMBINATION OF THESE ISSUES WERE LEGAL MEANING THAT MY BABY WOULD EITHER DIE IN UTERO HER BE STILLBORN. I THINK I STOPPED BREATHING IN THAT MOMENT CHERISH KATHERINE DIED ON DECEMBER THIRD TWO THOUSAND ANY. I LEFT THE HOSPITAL WITH MY DAUGHTER'S FOOTPRINT AND LIEU OF HER IN MY ARMS. INSTEAD OF SPENDING MY NEXT FEW DAYS GETTING SETTLED IN AT HOME WITH A NEW BABY I WENT TO A FUNERAL HOME TO MAKE ARRANGEMENTS TO HONOR CHURCHES LIFELESS BODY.

I OF THE HOSPITAL FOR MY STAY I WOULD THE FUNERAL HOME FOR THE TRANSFER OF CHURCHES BODY FROM THE HOSPITAL WHICH HAD TO BE APPROVED AND GRANTED BY THE HOSPITAL. AND FOR CREMATION EXPENSES I OF THE HOSPITAL FOR THE SURGERY I HAD TO HAVE JUST TWO WEEKS AFTER CHURCH WAS BORN BECAUSE SOMEHOW PART OF THE PLACENTA HAD REMAINED ATTACHED TO MY ROOM. CAUSING FURTHER MEDICAL COMPLICATIONS FOR ME. I WOULD FOR ALL THE COUNSELING THAT FOLLOWED MY SUFFERING. THROUGH ALL OF MY GRIEF ONE OF THE WORST EXPERIENCES WITH MORNING FOR MY ACCOUNTANT BUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHICH FORCED ME TO DENY THAT SHARES EVER EXISTED.

AN APPROPRIATION OF OVER ELEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME FUNDING FOR THREE SPECIFIC SETTLEMENTS THAT ARE ALREADY OUT BY NEED STATE OBLIGATIONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK THEM ABOUT. IS THERE ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING SIR AT THE PIT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. ANY OTHER ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE KNOW FILE. QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS SEEING NONE THIS GETS OUT UNABLE BECAUSE. WHO'S NEXT. MISTER MURATSUCHI I SIERRA. IN THE AUDIENCE. YOU'RE HERE WITH AB TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY NINE. OR A. I AM HERE TO PRESENT TO AB TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY NINE. A BILL THAT WOULD REQUIRE THE STATE AUDITOR'S. AUDITOR TO OBTAIN APPROVAL FROM THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE. PRIOR TO CONDUCTING AN INITIAL ASSESSMENT AND AUDIT OF A HIGH RISK LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCY. THIS BILL PASSED THE POLICY COMMITTEE ON A FIVE TO ONE VOTE. AND THE SPECIAL COMMITTEES ANALYSIS INDICATES MINOR COST TO THE STATE AUDITOR. SO NORMALLY I WOULD JUST STOP HERE AND SAY I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE VOTE. BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE MAY BE SOME FURTHER QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS BILL. I'M JUST A FOR THE RECORD THAT IS THE CHAIR OF THE JOINT LESS THAN ABOUT A COMMITTEE. I FULLY SUPPORT THE HIGH RISK LOCAL GOVERNMENT AUDIT PROGRAM AND I FULLY SUPPORT THE STATE AUDITOR ELAINE HOUSE WORK ON THIS PROGRAM. THE PROBLEM HERE IS THAT THE LESS THAN A COUNCIL. ISSUED A WRITTEN LEGAL OPINION THAT UNDER EXISTING LAW THE STATE AUDITOR DOES NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO CONDUCT AN IN SO ASSESSMENT. OF A HIGH RISK LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCY BEYOND A VERY LIMITED SCOPE. THIS BILL SEEKS TO ADDRESS THAT PROBLEM BY REQUIRING JAIL LACK TO PROVE THE INITIAL ASSESSMENT. AND AUDIT PRIOR TO MOVING FORWARD YOU THE MOTION BY MISTER CALDERON IN A SECOND BY MISTER OBERNOLTE. IDEA. HAPPEN ANSWERING QUESTIONS PERFECT TO HAVE SPEAKERS AND SUPPORT I DO NOT SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE NO FILE. WE DISCUSS I DON'T HAVE A RECOMMENDATION ON THIS I'M GONNA BE STAYING OFF I'M STILL. I I I DON'T KNOW I FULLY UNDERSTANDS THE ISSUE WELL ENOUGH TO VOTE ON IT TODAY BUT I'M NOT CONCERNED ABOUT THE FINANCIAL. RAMIFICATIONS OF THE BILL SO THANK YOU FOR COMING PRESENTED TO MISTER PARK HAS A QUESTION BOMB YA. I'LL BE STAYING OFF AS WELL MY CONCERN IS I WOULD JUST LIKE TO GIVE THEM THE AUTHORITY PERIOD. AND IT WOULD SAVE MONEY IF THE. COMMITTEE DOESN'T HAVE TO. OKAY ACT AND THEREFORE I'M GOING TO BE STAYING OFF BECAUSE I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD SPEND EVEN THAT AMOUNT OF MONEY. OKAY WELL LET LET ME JUST TO LAY OUT THE BASIC ISSUE IS WHETHER THERE SHOULD BE ANY CHECKS AND BALANCES BETWEEN THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE AUDITOR. THE THE ISSUE IS WHETHER THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD EXERCISE OVERSIGHT. THROUGH J. LIKE RECEIVING NOTIFICATION OF ANY POTENTIAL HIGH RISK AUDIT IN YOUR COMMUNITY UP PRIOR TO THE AUDITOR GOING ON YOU AND YOUR COMMITTEE TO CONDUCT INVESTIGATIONS AND SO. PURCHASE IT RATHER THAN JUST HAVING THE JAIL LIKE APPROVAL AT THE AUDIT STAGE WE'RE JUST TRYING TO MOVE UP. THE POINT AT WHICH J. LACK. REQUIRES THE OUGHT TO COME BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE THROUGH THE JAIL LACK TO. A TO INDICATE WHAT THEY PLAN TO DO YEAH I JUST DON'T THINK POLITICIANS SHOULD BE INVOLVED. I DON'T TRUST HIM. I THINK. I THINK YOU'RE ADVOCATING THE LEGISLATORS OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITY. I'M GONNA M. THERE'S NO CONFUSION ON THE VOTES BUT. WE HAVE A MOTION A SECOND AND. SO YOU HAVE QUESTION I'M SORRY MISTER OBERNOLTE IT AND SEE. I THINK YOU MANAGER OF MISTER MARCHI ENORMOUS. A SUPPORTER OF WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO HERE DEFINITELY THINK THAT THE. DEGREE OF OVERSIGHT THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS OVER. THE AUDITOR SHE IN THOSE HIGH RISK AUDIT SITUATION SHOULD BE CLARIFIED BECAUSE IT'S VERY UNCLEAR RIGHT NOW. SO I APPRECIATE YOU ARE TAKING ON THE ISSUE I UNDERSTAND SENATOR LARA HAS A BILL ON THIS EXACT SAME TOPIC IN THE AUDITOR ALSO HAS CONCERNS ARE YOU CONFIDENT THAT THE THREE OF YOU ARE GOING TO GET TO A PLACE THAT. EVERYONE AGREES AND AND. WE CAN HAVE ONE UNIFIED FRONT MOVING FORWARD ON THIS YES. THE STATE AUDITOR AND CENTER LARA AND I HAD MASSED. IT'S AND SARAH LAUREN. AGREED TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS TOGETHER. SEVERAL LARA RECOGNIZES THAT. THERE IS A LEGAL PROBLEM HERE THAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED. THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MY BILL ON SEVERAL LARA SPILL. IS THAT I'M ASKING FOR THE J. LIKE APPROVAL TO BE. MOVED UP EARLIER IN THE PROCESS. HIS IS YOU KNOW FOR JAIL ACT TO UP TO PROVE THE AUDIT. BUT. ITS ACT WHETHER IT'S A SARAH LAWRENCE VERSION OR MY VERSION THERE IS STILL A CHECK IF THE ONLY QUESTION IS AT WHAT POINT DOES JAIL LIKE CHECKING. BUT I AM CONFIDENT THAT WE WILL WORK IT OUT THIS IS ORIGINALLY CENTER LAURA'S. BABY THIS IS GONNA HE IS THE ORIGINAL AUTHOR OF THE HIGH RISK LOCAL AUDIT. PROGRAM. AND IF HE ADDRESSES THE ISSUES THAT I'M RAISING I'D BE PERFECTLY HAPPY TO DROP MY BILL. BUT AS THEIR INSTITUTIONAL MATTER I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO HAVE. AN OPPORTUNITY TO CHECK AND. YOU KNOW WITHOUT THE STATE AUDITOR. THAT BEING OF THE GO OUT CONDUCT INVESTIGATIONS WITHOUT ANY LESS THAN. APPROVED ART BUT THINK IT'S GOOD TO HEAR THAT I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU MA'AM MISTER MURATSUCHI. I'M I'M HOPEFUL THEY AND. AS ISSUES FOR YOU WILL. WORK WITH MRS CENTER LARA OBVIOUSLY I HAVE BEEN THIS BILL WILL. GO TO HIS COMMITTEE AND NICE I ONLY UNDERSTAND THAT OKAY. WITH THAT THIS GETS OUT ON ME B.

AND REVENUE FOR STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND THE BUSINESS MODEL IS JUST ANOTHER ONE OF THESE THINGS WHERE IT'S A RENTAL CAR COMPANY WITH THE NAP.
