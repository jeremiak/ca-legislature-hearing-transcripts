SHINING LIGHT DURING COVE IT.

00:31:59.851 --> 00:32:02.186
IS THAT WE DON'T- HEALTH CARE

CODED. THE DATA THAT WE DO HAVE

00:32:10.662 --> 00:32:12.330

01:04:49.919 --> 01:04:51.487
I DO WANT AT LEAST NOW YOU KNOW

01:04:51.554 --> 01:04:54.757
MAKE AN EDUCATED VOTE HERE AS

01:04:54.824 --> 01:04:55.791

CERTAINLY AND I AND I

01:05:10.773 --> 01:05:12.942
APPRECIATE THE QUESTION- SO I

01:05:13.009 --> 01:05:14.977
THINK THAT THE ONE THING THAT

01:05:15.044 --> 01:05:16.512
WE NEED TO SAY IS THAT SOMEONE

01:05:16.579 --> 01:05:18.748
IS NOT GIVEN A DIAGNOSIS AND

01:05:18.814 --> 01:05:20.483
REQUESTING A MEDICATION I DON'T

01:05:20.549 --> 01:05:21.684
THINK EVER HAPPENS LIKE THAT

01:05:21.751 --> 01:05:22.785
RIGHT SOMEBODY HAS BEEN GIVEN A

01:05:22.852 --> 01:05:26.589
DIAGNOSIS THEY HAVE GENERALLY

01:05:26.656 --> 01:05:27.189
YOU KNOW SOME THE OPPOSITION I

01:05:27.256 --> 01:05:28.724
GREW. IT CAN IS ARE PEOPLE WHO

01:05:28.791 --> 01:05:29.625
HAVE A TO. ILLNESS THEY ARE

01:05:29.692 --> 01:05:32.862
GOING TO DIE. THE OFTENTIMES IN

01:05:32.928 --> 01:05:34.530
IN FOR ALL THE DATA WE'VE SEEN

01:05:34.597 --> 01:05:35.765
PEOPLE ENGAGE ACTIVELY IN

01:05:35.831 --> 01:05:38.467
TREATMENT AND IN TRIALS AND

01:05:38.534 --> 01:05:40.569
THEN CHEMO AND DO EVERYTHING.

01:05:40.636 --> 01:05:43.039
TILL THEY DECIDED THAT'S- THE

01:05:43.105 --> 01:05:45.474
CONSEQUENCES ARE NOT. WORTH T

01:05:45.541 --> 01:05:49.178
ANYMORE AND WE'RE TO END IN THE

01:05:49.245 --> 01:05:50.780
END IS VERY NEAR IT IT IS NOT

01:05:50.846 --> 01:05:52.715
IT THE END OF THE MIRACLE HAS

01:05:52.782 --> 01:05:54.350
NOT HAPPENED THE TREATMENT HAS

01:05:54.417 --> 01:05:56.252
NOT TURNED THINGS AROUND. AT

01:05:56.319 --> 01:05:58.487
THAT POINT SOMEBODY OFTENTIMES

01:05:58.554 --> 01:05:59.088
THAT TOWARDS THE END THEY HAVE

01:05:59.155 --> 01:06:02.792
NOW. DETERIORATED TO A POINT

01:06:02.858 --> 01:06:03.859
WHERE IF THEY WERE TO ASK THE

01:06:03.926 --> 01:06:06.262
PHYSICIAN. I'D LIKE TO EXERCISE

01:06:06.329 --> 01:06:08.964
THIS- THE PHYSICIAN AT THAT

01:06:09.031 --> 01:06:10.399
POINT AND I THINK WHAT WE HEARD

01:06:10.466 --> 01:06:11.834
SOME SOMETIMES IF YOU HAVEN'T

01:06:11.901 --> 01:06:12.601
ASKED YOU DON'T KNOW RIGHT SO

01:06:12.668 --> 01:06:14.403
THAT POSITIONAL SAY OKAY YOU'LL

01:06:14.470 --> 01:06:15.571
HAVE FIFTY DAYS I'M NOT GOING

01:06:15.638 --> 01:06:17.073
TO DO IT AND YOU SAY CAN I GET

01:06:17.139 --> 01:06:18.908
A REFER. A I'M SORRY I'M A

DOCUMENT WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE

01:06:20.309 --> 01:06:21.911
SAYING YOU HAVE TO DOCUMENT

01:06:21.977 --> 01:06:22.812
THAT YOU ARE NOT GOING TO DO IT

01:06:22.878 --> 01:06:25.314
AND THEN- SO THEN THAT THAT

01:06:25.381 --> 01:06:27.083
PATIENT HAS TO GO. WITH HOPE

01:06:27.149 --> 01:06:28.951
YOU KNOW MAYBE A VERY SHORT

01:06:29.018 --> 01:06:30.686
TIME TO TRY TO FIND ANOTHER

01:06:30.753 --> 01:06:32.788
POSITION TO DO THAT INITIAL AND

01:06:32.855 --> 01:06:34.924
THEN WAIT FIFTEEN DAYS AFTER

01:06:34.990 --> 01:06:37.493
THAT TIME. TO ASK THE SECOND

01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:40.029
POSITION IT IS IT IS THAT IT IS

01:06:40.096 --> 01:06:42.898
IT IS THAT PERIOD SOMETIMES AND

01:06:42.965 --> 01:06:44.100
LIKE WE HEARD ONE OF THE YOUNG

01:06:44.166 --> 01:06:46.369
WOMEN SUPPORTERS CALLED IN AND

01:06:46.435 --> 01:06:48.304
SAID. IT THEY HAD THOUGHT

01:06:48.371 --> 01:06:50.740
PHYSICIAN WAS GOING SAY OKAY-AND THEY- WHEN THEY WERE TOLD

01:06:50.806 --> 01:06:52.007
NO THAT THAT STARTED THE CLOCK

01:06:52.074 --> 01:06:53.042
BUT THAT DIDN'T START THE CLOCK

01:06:53.109 --> 01:06:54.777
BECAUSE- THEY WERE NOT

01:06:54.844 --> 01:06:56.512
EVALUATED. TO THAT DEGREE. SO

01:06:56.579 --> 01:06:57.680
THAT'S THE ISSUE AND WE'RE NOT

01:06:57.747 --> 01:06:59.181
ANTICIPATING THAT PEOPLE WILL.

01:06:59.248 --> 01:07:01.083
ACTIVATE THAT FORTY EIGHT HOURS

01:07:01.150 --> 01:07:03.319

THE ALL THE PEOPLE WE HEARD

01:07:04.620 --> 01:07:05.988
THAT SAID IT WASN'T TOO LATE

01:07:06.055 --> 01:07:08.057
AND THEN HE OR SHE DIED IN

01:07:08.124 --> 01:07:08.791
EXACTLY THE WAY THEY DIDN'T

01:07:08.858 --> 01:07:10.926
WANT TO DIE. AFTER HAVING TOLD

01:07:10.993 --> 01:07:12.361

CONSISTENTLY IN OTHER STATES

01:07:17.366 --> 01:07:19.135
AND THAT'S WHY- WE'RE GOING TO

01:07:19.201 --> 01:07:21.871

01:07:36.552 --> 01:07:38.287
THE ASSEMBLY WHEN YOU KNOW YOUR

01:07:38.354 --> 01:07:38.788
FIRST BILL CAME DURING

01:07:38.854 --> 01:07:41.557
STRUGGLED. MIGHTILY WITH THAT

01:07:41.624 --> 01:07:44.260
FRANKLY AS A AS A CATHOLIC- BUT

01:07:44.326 --> 01:07:46.295
IS ALSO SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T

01:07:46.362 --> 01:07:48.931
WANT THE GOVERNMENT TO. YOU

01:07:48.998 --> 01:07:51.500
KNOW STEP INTO MY LIFE TO THE

01:07:51.567 --> 01:07:53.569

01:07:55.271 --> 01:07:59.408
THIS IS A TOUGH ONE BY- THE

01:07:59.475 --> 01:08:00.776
TIME LINE IS A LITTLE BIT OF A

01:08:00.843 --> 01:08:02.578
CONCERN I GET WHAT YOU'RE

01:08:02.645 --> 01:08:04.480
SAYING THAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES

01:08:04.547 --> 01:08:05.614
AT SOME OF THESE PATIENTS HAVE

01:08:05.681 --> 01:08:07.750
FOUND THEMSELVES IN WORDS VERY

01:08:07.817 --> 01:08:09.251
FRUSTRATING OF A VERY MADE THE

01:08:09.318 --> 01:08:10.286
DECISION AND THEN YET THEY

01:08:10.352 --> 01:08:11.754
CAN'T FOLLOW THROUGH ON THAT

01:08:11.821 --> 01:08:12.755
DECISION I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND

01:08:12.822 --> 01:08:14.790
THAT. THOUGH I ALSO UNDERSTAND

01:08:14.857 --> 01:08:15.691
THE CONCERNS OF SOME OTHERS

01:08:15.758 --> 01:08:17.893
WHERE- THAT IS A VERY SHORT

01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:21.497
PERIOD OF TIME. DURING WHICH-

01:08:21.564 --> 01:08:22.598
YEAH I HAVE SOME BAD DAYS I

01:08:22.665 --> 01:08:23.999

NOT SO GREAT AND- HIS MOOD

01:08:29.405 --> 01:08:31.841

OF THE BILL AND IT IS COLLECTED

01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:13.435

01:11:13.502 --> 01:11:14.870
REMOVING THE SUNSET JUST WILL

01:11:14.937 --> 01:11:16.805
LET'S JUST BE WIDE OPEN THERE

01:11:16.872 --> 01:11:18.107

01:11:52.608 --> 01:11:54.043
MAYBE IT WOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN

01:11:54.109 --> 01:11:57.046

01:49:45.211 --> 01:49:46.680
WERE ELIMINATING THAT CAP TO BE

01:49:46.746 --> 01:49:47.914
ABLE TO DO IT MORE THAN TWICE

01:49:47.981 --> 01:49:50.450
GOTCHA I SEE OKAY YES WE ARE

01:49:50.517 --> 01:49:52.485
THAT IS CORRECT. I'M MORE THAN

01:49:52.552 --> 01:49:53.853
HAPPY TO TALK WITH YOU MORE

01:49:53.920 --> 01:49:56.022
OFFLINE IF THAT IS HELPFUL US

01:49:56.089 --> 01:49:57.324
SENATOR GROUP BUT I CAN ALSO

01:49:57.390 --> 01:49:58.725
GIVE YOU SOME EXAMPLES OF WHAT

01:49:58.792 --> 01:49:59.893
THEY HAVE DONE UNDER THE

01:49:59.960 --> 01:50:02.295
EMERGENCY OF RULEMAKING IF

01:50:02.362 --> 01:50:03.496
THAT'S HELPFUL IN THE

01:50:03.563 --> 01:50:05.432
TRANSPARENCY PIECE BUT I THINK

01:50:05.498 --> 01:50:06.933
WHAT YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT IS

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.769
THE NUMBER OF DAYS- IN REGULAR

01:50:09.836 --> 01:50:11.304
RULEMAKING VERSUS THE EMERGENCY

01:50:11.371 --> 01:50:12.739
RULE MAKING IS THAT CORRECT.

01:50:12.806 --> 01:50:14.808
YES BECAUSE IF YOU KNOW PUBLIC

01:50:14.874 --> 01:50:16.109
COMMENT IT TAKES AND WE ALL

01:50:16.176 --> 01:50:17.210
KNOW WHAT HAPPENS AND PEOPLE

01:50:17.277 --> 01:50:18.411
AROUND SACRAMENTO KNOW WHAT

01:50:18.478 --> 01:50:19.913

PEOPLE WANT TO HAVE COMMENT ON

01:50:22.615 --> 01:50:23.984
CERTAIN THINGS. AND I THINK

01:50:24.050 --> 01:50:25.885
HEALTHCARE IS SOMETHING THAT WE

01:50:25.952 --> 01:50:27.020

01:50:27.087 --> 01:50:28.455
