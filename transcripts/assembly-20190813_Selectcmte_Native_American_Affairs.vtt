LOCAL AGENCIES ON THE LAWS THAT

00:50:38.535 --> 00:50:41.004

00:50:41.071 --> 00:50:42.606
PRIORITY TO SUCCESSION

00:50:42.672 --> 00:50:43.106
RETENTION PLANNING AND

00:50:43.173 --> 00:50:46.676
RECRUITMENT. I'M THE ISSUE HERE

00:50:46.743 --> 00:50:50.213
WAS. PRIOR TO JOINING THE

00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:51.214
COMMISSION THE COMMISSION HAD

00:50:51.281 --> 00:50:53.950
AGAIN I. KNOW THREE TO FIVE

00:50:54.017 --> 00:50:55.919
STAFF AT SOMETIMES. LIKE A V.

00:50:55.986 --> 00:50:58.622
IN THE BLAST YEARS UP TO NINE.

00:50:58.688 --> 00:51:01.658
HAD A FLAT STRUCTURE AND SO.

00:51:01.725 --> 00:51:04.995
WAS SEEN AS IF YOU GOT A

00:51:05.061 --> 00:51:06.229
POSITION WITHIN THE COMMISSION

00:51:06.296 --> 00:51:07.431
THERE WAS NOT REALLY ANYWHERE

00:51:07.497 --> 00:51:09.332
TO GO EXCEPT TO PROMOTE IN

00:51:09.399 --> 00:51:10.901
PLACE IF YOU REALLY WANTED TO

00:51:10.967 --> 00:51:11.535
STAY AND YOU REALLY WANT TO BE

00:51:11.601 --> 00:51:13.403
COMMITTED TO THIS WORK. WHAT

00:51:13.470 --> 00:51:15.071
WE'VE DONE NOW AND YOU CAN LOOK

00:51:15.138 --> 00:51:17.808
ON THE LAST PAGE IS ACTUALLY A

00:51:17.874 --> 00:51:20.477
PROPOSED ORG CHART. AND WE

00:51:20.544 --> 00:51:21.878
ACTUALLY MESSED WITH THIS A

00:51:21.945 --> 00:51:26.082
LITTLE BIT. BASED ON AND- ON

00:51:26.149 --> 00:51:32.022
AND. ON THE BUDGET PROCESS

00:51:32.088 --> 00:51:32.656
BASICALLY SO IT LOOKS DIFFERENT

00:51:32.722 --> 00:51:33.857
NOW BUT AS ADOPTED IT IS

00:51:33.924 --> 00:51:34.825
BASICALLY LIKE A TOP DOWN

00:51:34.891 --> 00:51:35.592
STRUCTURE WHERE THERE ARE

00:51:35.659 --> 00:51:36.660
PLACES FOR PEOPLE TO KIND OF

00:51:36.726 --> 00:51:38.295
JUMP AROUND IF THEY WANT TO

00:51:38.361 --> 00:51:39.463
BUILD THEIR SKILLS AND STAY

00:51:39.529 --> 00:51:41.898
WITH THE AGENCY LONG TERM. SO

00:51:41.965 --> 00:51:44.034
PART OF WHAT WE'VE DONE AND

00:51:44.100 --> 00:51:46.236
WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF

00:51:46.303 --> 00:51:49.372
ESTABLISHING A LOT OF POSITIONS

00:51:49.439 --> 00:51:49.973
WHICH TAKES QUITE SOME TIME BY

00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:53.844
IT. WILL HAVE EIGHTY CHIEF

00:51:53.910 --> 00:51:55.445
DEPUTY THAT WILL OVERSEE THEM

00:51:55.512 --> 00:51:57.214
BY THE ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENT

00:51:57.280 --> 00:51:59.783
AND THAT'S THE EVERY DAY LIKE.

00:51:59.850 --> 00:52:01.418
IF A STATE AGENCY OR A LEAD

00:52:01.485 --> 00:52:03.320
AGENCY NEEDS TIME TO FIGURE OUT

00:52:03.386 --> 00:52:04.588
WHO TO CONTACT WHICH TRIBES TO

00:52:04.654 --> 00:52:06.423
CONTACT THE CONTACT THAT

00:52:06.490 --> 00:52:07.324
DEPARTMENT. AND THAT'S

00:52:07.390 --> 00:52:09.593
BASICALLY THE BULK OF OUR DAY

00:52:09.659 --> 00:52:11.027
TO DAY WORK WE WILL ALSO BE

00:52:11.094 --> 00:52:12.329
ESTABLISHING A CHIEF COUNSEL

00:52:12.395 --> 00:52:13.897
POSITION WHICH WILL OVERSEE ALL

00:52:13.964 --> 00:52:15.632
OF THE LEGAL PROGRAMS

00:52:15.699 --> 00:52:17.434
INCLUDING. WE HAVE A NUMBER

00:52:17.501 --> 00:52:19.202
WHICH I'LL- I'LL TALK ABOUT NOW

00:52:19.269 --> 00:52:22.772
ACTUALLY OF AT CLINICS THAT WE

00:52:22.839 --> 00:52:24.140
HAVE ESTABLISHED WITHIN THE UC

00:52:24.207 --> 00:52:25.876
SYSTEM AHMED AT SEVERAL LAW

00:52:25.942 --> 00:52:29.579

THE AGENCY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR

00:52:36.586 --> 00:52:39.523
AND SO LONG TERM THE IDEA IS TO

00:52:39.589 --> 00:52:42.459
YOU REALLY CREATE THE CAPACITY

00:52:42.526 --> 00:52:44.694

00:57:14.297 --> 00:57:15.298
THINGS ARE NOT WORKING WE WANT

00:57:15.365 --> 00:57:17.667
TO KNOW THAT BECAUSE- WE WERE

00:57:17.734 --> 00:57:18.501
NOT THE ONES THAT HAVE TO

00:57:18.568 --> 00:57:20.703
NAVIGATE THESE LAWS WE JUST TRY

00:57:20.770 --> 00:57:22.438
TO MAKE IT AS EASY AS POSSIBLE

00:57:22.505 --> 00:57:23.807
BUT WE DON'T ALWAYS KNOW WHAT

00:57:23.873 --> 00:57:25.742
IS THE STICKING POINT AND SO.

00:57:25.809 --> 00:57:27.177
RIGHT NOW WE'RE IN THE PROCESS

00:57:27.243 --> 00:57:28.378
OF UPDATING A LOT OF OUR INTAKE

00:57:28.444 --> 00:57:31.247
FORMS BUT ALSO ON THE BACK AND

00:57:31.314 --> 00:57:33.283
CREATING PROCESSES SO THAT

00:57:33.349 --> 00:57:35.852
NEWER STAFF CAN JUST KIND OF

00:57:35.919 --> 00:57:37.020
BASICALLY LOOK AT A CHECKLIST

00:57:37.086 --> 00:57:38.054
OF THE RESOURCES THAT THEY

00:57:38.121 --> 00:57:39.756
SHOULD BE LOOKING AT WHEN

00:57:39.823 --> 00:57:41.357
THEY'RE DETERMINING CERTAIN

00:57:41.424 --> 00:57:42.225
THINGS LIKE MOST LIKELY JUST

00:57:42.292 --> 00:57:44.561
DESCENDANTS. OR AREAS OF

00:57:44.627 --> 00:57:51.935
INTEREST AND THAT WE WERE NOT

00:57:52.001 --> 00:57:52.502
PEOPLE LIKE DEBBIE CAN ALSO

00:57:52.569 --> 00:57:57.040
RETIRE EVENTUALLY. AND SO STAND

00:57:57.106 --> 00:57:58.208
RISING PROCESSES AND THEN ALSO.

00:57:58.274 --> 00:58:00.243
WHAT WE'RE DOING INTERNALLY IS

00:58:00.310 --> 00:58:01.244
AT OUR STAFF MEETINGS ARE

00:58:01.311 --> 00:58:03.079
HAVING INTERNAL TRAININGS ON

00:58:03.146 --> 00:58:04.581
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE DO

00:58:04.647 --> 00:58:05.181
AND WE'RE FILMING THOUGH SO

00:58:05.248 --> 00:58:06.482
THAT WHEN WE DO ON BOARD

00:58:06.549 --> 00:58:08.818
PEOPLE. THEY CAN JUST TAKE A

00:58:08.885 --> 00:58:09.419
LOOK AT NOT A DIFFERENT STAFF

00:58:09.485 --> 00:58:12.055
TIME FOR THAT AS WELL. SO THE

00:58:12.121 --> 00:58:14.324
THIRD PRIORITY ON PAGE TWENTY

00:58:14.390 --> 00:58:14.858
SIX IS INCREASED INTERNAL

AND CHECKLIST AND SO WE

00:58:20.930 --> 00:58:22.165
ACTUALLY HAVE A CHECKLIST OF

00:58:22.232 --> 00:58:24.200
ALL OF THIS STRATEGIC PLAN TO

00:58:24.267 --> 00:58:25.201
SEE WHERE WE'RE AT AND WHETHER

00:58:25.268 --> 00:58:27.604

CURRENTLY GOING TO BE. WE'RE IN

00:58:36.212 --> 00:58:37.847
THE PROCESS OF ASSESSING WHAT

00:58:37.914 --> 00:58:39.449
THAT LOOKS LIKE BY EACH OF THE

00:58:39.515 --> 00:58:41.217
STAFF AT EACH OF THE

00:58:41.284 --> 00:58:42.719
REGULATIONS HAS A SENIOR STAFF

00:58:44.354 --> 00:58:46.189
TO IT. TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE

00:58:46.256 --> 00:58:49.225
GET THROUGH WITH THE IDEA THAT

00:58:49.292 --> 00:58:49.826

SOME OF OUR SISTER AGENCIES

00:58:56.299 --> 00:58:58.735

00:58:58.801 --> 00:58:59.769
HAVE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE

00:58:59.836 --> 00:59:03.539

01:03:59.635 --> 01:04:01.070
EFFORTS IF ANY ARE BEING MADE

01:04:01.137 --> 01:04:02.004
TO TRY AND MAKE SURE THE

01:04:02.071 --> 01:04:04.240
COMMISSION ITSELF HAS

01:04:04.307 --> 01:04:10.213
GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSITY. IN TERMS

01:04:10.279 --> 01:04:10.613
OF THE- OF NATIVE

01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:15.851
REPRESENTATION. SURE AND SO THE

01:04:15.918 --> 01:04:17.153
COMMISSION IS THAT ARE A

01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:17.753
GOVERNOR APPOINTED COMMISSION

01:04:17.820 --> 01:04:20.990
SO. KIND OF FREE EXECUTIVE

01:04:21.057 --> 01:04:22.158
ORDER BE TEN ELEVEN EDGE BUT

01:04:22.225 --> 01:04:23.392
PROBABLY LATER THAN THAT EVEN.

01:04:23.459 --> 01:04:25.494
I THINK THAT WELL I CAN'T SPEAK

01:04:25.561 --> 01:04:27.897
TO WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE BUT THE-

01:04:27.964 --> 01:04:28.464
STATES UNDERSTANDING OF THE

01:04:28.531 --> 01:04:29.632
COMPLEXITY AND DIVERSITY OF

01:04:29.699 --> 01:04:32.401
INDIAN COUNTRY WAS PROBABLY THE.

01:04:32.468 --> 01:04:33.002
AND NOT TO AT AT TO ANYONE'S

01:04:33.069 --> 01:04:34.704
FAULT I THINK THAT THERE IS

01:04:34.770 --> 01:04:35.838
JUST YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU

01:04:35.905 --> 01:04:37.540
DON'T KNOW WAS LESS DEVELOPED

01:04:37.607 --> 01:04:40.376
AND I THINK MOVING FORWARD THIS

01:04:40.443 --> 01:04:41.577
GOVERNOR IS COMMITTED TO

01:04:41.644 --> 01:04:45.314
FINDING. I GEOGRAPHICALLY

01:04:45.381 --> 01:04:47.917
DIVERSE CANDIDATES SIMILAR TO

01:04:47.984 --> 01:04:48.884
IF YOU'LL LOOK AT THE TRIBAL

01:04:48.951 --> 01:04:50.553
NATIONS GRANT FINDS WE ACTUALLY

01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:51.587
HAVE A MEMBER HERE IN THE

01:04:51.654 --> 01:04:54.423
AUDIENCE TODAY. TO I THINK

01:04:54.490 --> 01:04:55.424
MAYBE I'M SPEAKING ON THE

01:04:55.491 --> 01:04:59.595
PANELS WELL BUT- I. FROM THE

01:04:59.662 --> 01:05:00.930
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OUR

01:05:00.997 --> 01:05:02.398
PERSPECTIVE IS THAT WE WANT TO

01:05:02.465 --> 01:05:03.966
BE AS INCLUSIVE AND DIVERSE AS

01:05:04.033 --> 01:05:05.735
POSSIBLE SO. MOVING FORWARD WE

01:05:05.801 --> 01:05:07.169
NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT

01:05:07.236 --> 01:05:07.837
THAT LOOKS LIKE WITH THIS

01:05:07.903 --> 01:05:10.840
COMMISSION SPECIFICALLY BUT WE

01:05:10.906 --> 01:05:12.074
ARE COMMITTED TO MAKING SURE

01:05:12.141 --> 01:05:13.776
THAT WE'RE LISTENING TO TRIBES

01:05:13.843 --> 01:05:16.479
AND WHERE POSSIBLE TRYING TO.

01:05:16.545 --> 01:05:19.181
ACCOUNT FOR CULTURAL

01:05:19.248 --> 01:05:20.850
DIFFERENCES WHILE BEING IN LINE

01:05:20.916 --> 01:05:21.917
WITH THE MANDATES OF THE

01:05:21.984 --> 01:05:23.519
STATUTE. IN I RECOGNIZE

01:05:23.586 --> 01:05:26.956
PRECARIOUS SITUATION A LOT OF

01:05:27.023 --> 01:05:28.624
COMPETING FACTORS I JUST OF

01:05:28.691 --> 01:05:30.326
THAT BIG BIG JUST FROM WHAT THE

01:05:30.393 --> 01:05:31.560
CUT THE COUNTY I REPRESENT WE

01:05:31.627 --> 01:05:33.062
KNOW THIS IS THE THING. IT'S

01:05:33.129 --> 01:05:34.363
HARD TO DO WITH NINE POSITIONS

01:05:34.430 --> 01:05:36.432
AND WITHIN THE NIAGARA

01:05:36.499 --> 01:05:36.999
COMMITTEE IN OTHERS AND YOU

01:05:37.066 --> 01:05:38.167
JUST IT'S OF IT'S A THREAD

01:05:38.234 --> 01:05:39.201
THAT'S THROUGHOUT THE STRATEGIC

01:05:39.268 --> 01:05:40.569
PLANNING SHE MENTION OF REALLY

01:05:40.636 --> 01:05:42.605
DOING A LOT OF OUT REACH A LOT

01:05:42.672 --> 01:05:44.140
OF TRAINING. AND ONE ON MY HOPE

01:05:44.206 --> 01:05:46.242
BUT I HOPE IS AMONG THE MANY

01:05:46.309 --> 01:05:46.876
THINGS THAT WILL COME FROM THAT

01:05:46.942 --> 01:05:48.878
IS OPPORTUNITY GET MORE PEOPLE

01:05:48.944 --> 01:05:51.314
INVOLVED. AND I YOU MENTION

01:05:51.380 --> 01:05:52.081
THESE ARE GOING TO TWELVE POINT

01:05:52.148 --> 01:05:52.948
HE'S AND I THINK THE GOVERNOR'S

01:05:53.015 --> 01:05:56.719
PROVEN HIS UNDERSTANDING

01:05:56.786 --> 01:05:58.587
CONCERN IN AND WILLINGNESS TO

01:05:58.654 --> 01:06:00.756
ACT FOR CALIFORNIA'S NATIVES.

01:06:00.823 --> 01:06:02.558
OF THROUGH THE ISSUING OF THE

01:06:02.625 --> 01:06:05.328
OF THE APOLOGY WHICH IS

01:06:05.394 --> 01:06:07.596
INCREDIBLE GESTURE AND ONE THAT

01:06:07.663 --> 01:06:08.397
NOW NEEDS TO BE BACKED UP WITH

01:06:08.464 --> 01:06:09.799
ACTION WHICH IS THE FIRST TO

01:06:09.865 --> 01:06:11.033
NOTICE THAT AND I THINK YOUR

01:06:11.100 --> 01:06:12.668
PRESENCE IN THIS PLAN. INDICATE

01:06:12.735 --> 01:06:13.903
THAT THAT'S MORE THAN APOLOGY

01:06:13.969 --> 01:06:15.838
THIS IT'LL ACTION IN THIS

01:06:15.905 --> 01:06:17.340
ADMINISTRATION I THINK IT'S

01:06:17.406 --> 01:06:18.974
FAIR TO SAY SB FOR MY

01:06:19.041 --> 01:06:19.875
COLLEAGUES AT WORK FOR GAME TO

01:06:19.942 --> 01:06:21.243
DO OUR PART TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:06:21.310 --> 01:06:24.046
WERE. WRITING PAST WRONGS I'M

01:06:24.113 --> 01:06:25.681
AN AVID LASTLY JUST SAY IN THIS

01:06:25.748 --> 01:06:28.384
REGARD THERE'S A LIST OF GROUP

01:06:28.451 --> 01:06:29.819
POLICIES THAT THE SUBSEQUENT. I

01:06:29.885 --> 01:06:31.087
DID SPEAK TO THIS BUT TO BE

01:06:31.153 --> 01:06:32.521
ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THIS IS FAR

01:06:32.588 --> 01:06:33.923
BEYOND GAMING RIGHT THIS IS A

01:06:33.989 --> 01:06:36.292
BALLOT QUALITY OF LIFE WRITING

01:06:36.359 --> 01:06:37.960
HISTORIC INJUSTICES THE

01:06:38.027 --> 01:06:38.828
TREMENDOUS POVERTY AND OTHER

01:06:38.894 --> 01:06:39.862
SOCIAL CHALLENGES THAT ARE

01:06:39.929 --> 01:06:41.497
UNIQUE TO INDIAN COUNTRY. AND

01:06:41.564 --> 01:06:42.631
BEFORE AGAIN WHY THIS COMMITTEE

01:06:42.698 --> 01:06:44.567
HEARING IS SO IMPORTANT I WOULD

01:06:44.633 --> 01:06:45.501
UNDERSTAND THAT MOST PEOPLE

01:06:45.568 --> 01:06:47.136
THINK THAT THAT OUR CONCERN AND

01:06:47.203 --> 01:06:49.605
INTEREST IS IN A VERY NARROW

01:06:49.672 --> 01:06:50.740
BAND I THINK RECENT LEGISLATIVE

01:06:50.806 --> 01:06:52.241
EXPERIENCE AS IT TO ADD

01:06:52.308 --> 01:06:54.076
MENTIONED. IN IN YOUR TESTIMONY

01:06:54.143 --> 01:06:56.379
IS A TRIED WAY WE'RE TRYING TO

01:06:56.445 --> 01:07:04.520
WORKING DIRECTIONS. AROUND

01:07:04.587 --> 01:07:04.954
CULTURAL ADORNMENTS

01:07:05.020 --> 01:07:11.794
REPATRIATION AND SO ON. SO FOR

01:07:11.861 --> 01:07:13.596
IT. I THINK THE CALL OUT FROM

01:07:13.662 --> 01:07:14.196
THIS COMMITTEE TODAY SHOULD BE

01:07:14.263 --> 01:07:16.665

ADDITIONAL IDEAS OF THE WORK

01:07:18.300 --> 01:07:19.268
THAT MUST BE DONE. BECAUSE WE

01:07:19.335 --> 01:07:20.403
HAVE A AGENCY THAT'S WILLING TO

01:07:20.469 --> 01:07:21.904
DO WORK WE HAVE A EXECUTIVE

01:07:21.971 --> 01:07:23.205

THAT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO SHARE

01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:34.036
NEXT FEW MONTHS AND SO WE ARE

01:09:34.103 --> 01:09:35.204
VERY MUCH FOCUSED ON THAT AND

01:09:35.271 --> 01:09:36.272
ESPECIALLY NOW THAT WE'RE THE

01:09:36.338 --> 01:09:39.708
COMMISSION I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR.

01:09:39.775 --> 01:09:41.677
CAL MAG PRIOR WHICH REQUIRES

01:09:41.744 --> 01:09:44.313
REPATRIATION OF HUMAN REMAINS

01:09:44.380 --> 01:09:45.681

MUSEUMS WHICH INCLUDES THE UC'S

01:09:49.585 --> 01:09:52.988

PART OF WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO

01:09:54.657 --> 01:09:56.225

COLLABORATION AND GET. THE

01:10:05.401 --> 01:10:07.369
BIGGER ISSUE I THINK IS MORE OF

01:10:07.436 --> 01:10:08.704
THE CULTURAL SHIFT AND I THINK

01:10:08.771 --> 01:10:09.738
THAT THAT'S A STATEWIDE ISSUE

01:10:09.805 --> 01:10:10.906

PEOPLES BUT ALSO NATIVE REMAINS.

01:10:21.183 --> 01:10:21.684

JOIN THEM. AND. YOU KNOW

01:42:27.407 --> 01:42:29.009
CERTAINLY LOOKING BACK THERE

01:42:29.076 --> 01:42:31.345
WERE MANY THINGS I WAS EXPOSED

01:42:31.411 --> 01:42:32.880
TO AND MY FAMILY MEMBERS

01:42:32.946 --> 01:42:35.048
INCLUDING THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE

01:42:35.115 --> 01:42:36.149
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. THE JUVENILE

01:42:36.216 --> 01:42:38.585
DELINQUENCY PREMATURE DEATH

01:42:38.652 --> 01:42:40.721
AMONG OUR FAMILY MEMBERS AND

01:42:40.787 --> 01:42:43.857
OTHER THINGS THAT I GREW UP

01:42:43.924 --> 01:42:44.391
WITH NOT REALIZING HOW AND

01:42:44.458 --> 01:42:47.194
HEALTHY THEY WERE. AND MAKING A

01:42:47.261 --> 01:42:48.762
POINT IN MY OWN FAMILY IN MY

01:42:48.829 --> 01:42:52.599
OWN COMMUNITIES TO SEE THAT WE

01:42:52.666 --> 01:42:53.233
DO SOMETHING WE SEE THAT AND WE

01:42:53.300 --> 01:42:55.903
DON'T IDLY SIT BY. THE THINGS

01:42:55.969 --> 01:43:01.475
THAT. WE'VE GROWN UP WITH ALSO

01:43:01.542 --> 01:43:03.176
INCLUDING THE INHERENT RACISM

01:43:03.243 --> 01:43:05.245
IN OUR SCHOOLS AND GOVERNMENTS

01:43:05.312 --> 01:43:06.947
THAT COME THROUGH SOMETIMES

01:43:07.014 --> 01:43:09.483
SUBTLY SUCH AS CULTURALLY IN IT

01:43:09.550 --> 01:43:12.152
IN A SENSITIVE EVENTS THE

01:43:12.219 --> 01:43:13.854
MAKING MISSIONS OUT OF SUGAR

01:43:13.921 --> 01:43:15.923
CUBES THINGS LIKE THAT THAT

01:43:15.989 --> 01:43:17.224
LOWER THE SELF ESTEEM OF OUR

01:43:17.291 --> 01:43:19.660
NATIVE YOUTH THE HOMEWORK

01:43:19.726 --> 01:43:21.128
ASSIGNMENTS THAT HAVE PICTURES

01:43:21.194 --> 01:43:25.165
OF CARTOON LIKE NATIVES THOSE

01:43:25.232 --> 01:43:28.635
ARE THE THINGS THAT CONSTANTLY.

01:43:28.702 --> 01:43:29.269
MAKE OUR NATIVE CHILDREN FEEL

01:43:29.336 --> 01:43:31.438
LIKE THEIR LESSER THAN THEY ARE

01:43:31.505 --> 01:43:32.005
AND THAT THEY HAVE A HISTORY

01:43:32.072 --> 01:43:40.714
THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT.

01:43:40.781 --> 01:43:42.683
COMPLAINING TO THE SCHOOL AND

01:43:42.749 --> 01:43:44.484
THEN I HAVE TO ADMIT I GO TO

01:43:44.551 --> 01:43:45.085
THE SCHOOL PROBABLY A LITTLE

01:43:45.152 --> 01:43:46.687
BIT MORE OFTEN THAN SOME

01:43:46.753 --> 01:43:50.223
PARENTS IT MAY SEEM TRIVIAL.

01:43:50.290 --> 01:43:52.426
BUT AS THE AS THE NATIVE YOUTH

01:43:52.492 --> 01:43:53.594
GOING UP IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOL

01:43:53.660 --> 01:43:55.562
SYSTEMS I WENT TO OVER SEVEN

01:43:55.629 --> 01:43:57.264
SCHOOLS GROWING UP WE MOVED WAY

01:43:57.331 --> 01:43:59.766
TOO MUCH. THOSE THINGS ADD UP

01:43:59.833 --> 01:44:00.634
AND WHEN YOU SEE THOSE THINGS

01:44:00.701 --> 01:44:02.703
OVER AND OVER AGAIN ON YOU

01:44:02.769 --> 01:44:05.706
BEGIN TO BE CONFUSED ABOUT YOUR

01:44:05.772 --> 01:44:06.206
HISTORY AND YOU BEGIN TO

01:44:06.273 --> 01:44:10.077
BELIEVE THEM. THOSE TYPES OF.

01:44:10.143 --> 01:44:12.913
UP PRACTICES AND CURRICULUM.

01:44:12.980 --> 01:44:15.582
LEAD TO LOW SELF ESTEEM. WHICH

01:44:15.649 --> 01:44:17.718
LEADS TO PEOPLE BEING ANGRY AND

01:44:17.784 --> 01:44:19.586
VIOLENT. WHICH LEADS TO

01:44:19.653 --> 01:44:22.022
DESPERATION AND DEPRESSION. AND

01:44:22.089 --> 01:44:23.657
THEN DRUG ABUSE AND EVENTUALLY

01:44:23.724 --> 01:44:25.626
YOU SEE YOURSELF IN THE

01:44:25.692 --> 01:44:26.660
JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM AND

01:44:26.727 --> 01:44:29.663
THEN EVENTUALLY TO PRESENT. ON.

01:44:29.730 --> 01:44:31.398
AND THAT'S JUST A PATH THAT

01:44:31.465 --> 01:44:32.499
WE'VE ALL SEEN IN OUR

01:44:32.566 --> 01:44:34.468
COMMUNITIES ALL TOO OFTEN AND

01:44:34.534 --> 01:44:36.903
THAT THIS IS A WAY TO PREVENT

01:44:36.970 --> 01:44:38.672
THAT FROM THE BEGINNING TO GET

01:44:38.739 --> 01:44:41.241
IN THERE THE FIRST TIME THAT

01:44:41.308 --> 01:44:44.845

01:45:08.869 --> 01:45:10.337
JUSTICE THEN BUT I DO KNOW

01:45:10.404 --> 01:45:12.572

01:45:12.639 --> 01:45:14.408
PROGRAM THAT THEY SENT THEM TO

01:45:14.474 --> 01:45:16.043

BUT IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE

01:46:11.765 --> 01:46:13.333
SYSTEM TO ALSO EMBRACE AND

01:46:13.400 --> 01:46:15.702

ABLE TO PROVIDE WHAT THE TRIBE

01:46:54.808 --> 01:46:56.576
COULD PROVIDE. AND THAT'S WHY

01:46:56.643 --> 01:46:59.246
WE NEED THE TRIBAL PROGRAMS

01:46:59.312 --> 01:47:00.714
BECAUSE THE TRIBE KNOWS IT'S

01:47:00.781 --> 01:47:02.783
COMMUNITY. THE TRIBE KNOWS THE

01:47:02.849 --> 01:47:05.552

THE PRINCIPAL EVERYBODY HAS TO

01:47:45.158 --> 01:47:46.293
LOOK AT EACH OTHER AND TALK

01:47:46.359 --> 01:47:48.094

MAYBE THEY'RE NOT BEST FRIENDS

01:48:20.026 --> 01:48:21.027
BUT THEY CAN CO EXIST AT SCHOOL

01:48:21.094 --> 01:48:22.262
WITHOUT THOSE TYPES OF.

01:48:22.329 --> 01:48:24.264

INFIGHTING BETWEEN THE NATIVE

01:48:42.649 --> 01:48:44.517
BACK TO THEIR OWN IDENTITY. IT

01:48:44.584 --> 01:48:47.287
GOES BACK TO HAVING TO LOOK A

01:48:47.354 --> 01:48:48.922

01:49:39.940 --> 01:49:41.875
DEPARTMENT REPRESENTATIVE AND

01:49:41.942 --> 01:49:43.176
THEY SIT DOWN AND THEY SAY

01:49:43.243 --> 01:49:44.744
YOU'RE GOING TO FILL OUT YOUR

01:49:44.811 --> 01:49:46.479
FAMILY TREE AND THEY ALL FIND

01:49:46.546 --> 01:49:48.348
OUT OH MY GOSH I'M RELATED TO

01:49:48.415 --> 01:49:50.150
HER AND RELATED TO HIM AND

01:49:50.216 --> 01:49:51.618
THAT'S A GOOD. THING TO KNOW

01:49:51.685 --> 01:49:56.089
FOR OTHER REASONS. SO. IT IT'S

01:49:56.156 --> 01:49:56.656
VERY IMPORTANT TO KNOW WHERE

01:49:56.723 --> 01:49:58.224
YOU COME FROM. IN OUR

01:49:58.291 --> 01:50:00.493
COMMUNITIES ARE VERY VERY SMALL

01:50:00.560 --> 01:50:02.195
AND I TELL MY OWN CHILDREN YOU

01:50:02.262 --> 01:50:03.229
KNOW YOU HAVE COUSINS ON PRETTY

01:50:03.296 --> 01:50:04.831
MUCH EVERY RESERVATION IN SAN

01:50:04.898 --> 01:50:07.100
DIEGO SO JUST REMEMBER THAT.

01:50:07.167 --> 01:50:09.903
AND KNOW WHO YOUR FAMILY IS AND

01:50:09.970 --> 01:50:12.238
SO THOSE ARE THE TYPES OF

01:50:12.305 --> 01:50:13.940
PRACTICAL THINGS BUT THINGS

01:50:14.007 --> 01:50:17.143
THAT THAT COME FROM JUST. THAT

01:50:17.210 --> 01:50:19.179
THE ESSENCE OF BEING WHO WE ARE

01:50:19.245 --> 01:50:21.748
THEY CAN DO SO MUCH TO PREVENT

01:50:21.815 --> 01:50:22.382
THE PATH THAT WE SEE SO MANY OF

01:50:22.449 --> 01:50:27.387
OUR YOUTH. GOING DOWN. RIGHT

01:50:27.454 --> 01:50:29.756
NOW THE INTER TRIBAL COURT IS

01:50:29.823 --> 01:50:31.491
EMBARKING ON A HEALING TO

01:50:31.558 --> 01:50:33.326
WELLNESS PROJECT WHERE WERE

01:50:33.393 --> 01:50:35.795
DEVELOPING A YOUTH PEER COURT.

01:50:35.862 --> 01:50:38.031
WE VISITED SEVERAL MODELS FROM

01:50:38.098 --> 01:50:40.433
LA TO RIVERSIDE TO ONES THAT WE

01:50:40.500 --> 01:50:41.901
SAW ON OTHER STATES AND WE

01:50:41.968 --> 01:50:43.036
REALLY LIKE TO THE YOUTH CARE

01:50:43.103 --> 01:50:45.672
COURT MODEL BECAUSE IT LETS YOU

01:50:45.739 --> 01:50:47.674
HOLD THEIR FELLOW YOUTH

01:50:47.741 --> 01:50:50.310
ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS.

01:50:50.377 --> 01:50:53.013
AND IT ALSO PROVIDES THE YOUTH

01:50:53.079 --> 01:50:54.247
PARTICIPATING AT THE COULD SAY

01:50:54.314 --> 01:50:57.017
THE PIER JURY ON TO LEARN ABOUT

01:50:57.083 --> 01:50:58.952
THE COURT SYSTEM IN A WAY WHERE

01:50:59.019 --> 01:51:00.420
IT'S NOT ADVERSARIAL WHERE

01:51:00.487 --> 01:51:01.755
THEY'RE NOT COMING IN WHEN

01:51:01.821 --> 01:51:02.555
THEY'RE IN TROUBLE BUT THEY'RE

01:51:02.622 --> 01:51:05.492
THERE TO BE PROACTIVE AND TO DO

01:51:05.558 --> 01:51:06.059
SOMETHING. TO SUPPORT THEIR

01:51:06.126 --> 01:51:09.396
THEIR FELLOW YOU. SO WE ARE

01:51:09.462 --> 01:51:11.664
EMBARKING ON THIS PILOT WHERE

01:51:11.731 --> 01:51:12.899
WE HAVE ALREADY TWO TRIBES THAT

01:51:12.966 --> 01:51:15.702
ARE INTERESTED WE HAVE SEVERAL

01:51:15.769 --> 01:51:18.004
MORE THAT ARE ALREADY DOING

01:51:18.071 --> 01:51:19.406
DIFFERENT TYPES OF THINGS WITH

01:51:19.472 --> 01:51:21.207
WELLNESS PLANS WHERE WE'RE

01:51:21.274 --> 01:51:22.475
GOING TO TRY TO BRING THIS ALL

01:51:22.542 --> 01:51:23.877
TOGETHER SO THAT NGUYEN TRIBAL

01:51:23.943 --> 01:51:27.981
POLICE SITE. THE JUVENILES INTO

01:51:28.048 --> 01:51:30.383
OUR COURT FOR. BASICALLY STATUS

01:51:30.450 --> 01:51:32.585
OFFENSES THE LOW LEVEL OFFENSES

01:51:32.652 --> 01:51:34.154
THAT THE COURT WILL DIVERT THEM

01:51:34.220 --> 01:51:36.022
INTO THIS YOUTH PEER COURT

01:51:36.089 --> 01:51:39.125
WHERE WE WILL. ESSENTIALLY

01:51:39.192 --> 01:51:41.995
REQUIRE THEM TO ADMIT GUILT TO

01:51:42.062 --> 01:51:44.998
BE ABLE TO ACCEPT THE WHEN I

01:51:45.065 --> 01:51:45.765
CALL MORE PERSPECTIVE

01:51:45.832 --> 01:51:47.934
CONSEQUENCES THEN HAVING THAT

01:51:48.001 --> 01:51:49.702
ON THERE THEIR TRIBAL COURT

01:51:49.769 --> 01:51:52.539
RECORD ON AND HAVING JUST

01:51:52.605 --> 01:51:54.007
FACING LARGE FINES THAT ARE

01:51:54.074 --> 01:51:55.208
GOING TO DO ANYTHING TO ADDRESS

01:51:55.275 --> 01:51:57.444
THE ACTUAL PROBLEM SO WE'RE

01:51:57.510 --> 01:51:58.211
GONNA DO THINGS SUCH AS

01:51:58.278 --> 01:52:00.146
COMMUNITY SERVICE CULTURAL

01:52:00.213 --> 01:52:03.716
PROGRAMS. THEY WILL ALSO HAVE

01:52:03.783 --> 01:52:05.351
TO COME BACK AND SERVE ON THE

01:52:05.418 --> 01:52:07.620
PIER JURY AND THAT'S A MODEL

01:52:07.687 --> 01:52:10.256
THAT RIVERSIDE COUNTY DID THAT

01:52:10.323 --> 01:52:10.857
I WAS VERY IMPRESSED WITH. AND

01:52:10.924 --> 01:52:13.693
WHEN WE WERE THERE. ON SOME OF

01:52:13.760 --> 01:52:14.727
THE KIDS THAT WERE ORIGINALLY

01:52:14.794 --> 01:52:17.130
THE OFFENDERS AND HAD CAME BACK

01:52:17.197 --> 01:52:17.997
YOU KNOW THEY WERE THE ONES

01:52:18.064 --> 01:52:19.399
RIGHT UP THERE IN THE FACE OF

01:52:19.466 --> 01:52:20.900
THE OFFENDERS ASKING QUESTIONS

01:52:20.967 --> 01:52:21.835
AND SAYING DIDN'T YOU THINK

01:52:21.901 --> 01:52:23.203
ABOUT YOUR COMMUNITY WHEN YOU

01:52:23.269 --> 01:52:24.704
WERE DOING THIS. AND IT WAS

01:52:24.771 --> 01:52:25.805
REALLY NEAT TO SEE THE TURN

01:52:25.872 --> 01:52:27.707
AROUND IN IN THOSE YOUTH AND

01:52:27.774 --> 01:52:29.642
I'M I'M HOPING WE CAN REPLICATE

01:52:29.709 --> 01:52:33.146
THAT MODEL WITHIN OUR OWN. ON I

01:52:33.213 --> 01:52:34.481
COULD TALK ALL DAY ABOUT THE

01:52:34.547 --> 01:52:35.582
EXCITING THINGS THAT WE ARE

01:52:35.648 --> 01:52:37.884
WANTING TO DO. I HOPE THAT I'VE

01:52:37.951 --> 01:52:40.954
PROVIDED YOU. AND SNAPSHOT OF

01:52:41.020 --> 01:52:42.655
WHAT WE'RE LOOKING TO DO AND

01:52:42.722 --> 01:52:44.424
SOME THINGS THAT MANY OF THE

01:52:44.491 --> 01:52:45.458
OTHER TRIBAL COURTS HAVE HAVE

01:52:45.525 --> 01:52:48.027
ALREADY BEEN DOING. BUT WE

01:52:48.094 --> 01:52:49.529
CAN'T DO THAT WITHOUT CONTINUED

01:52:49.596 --> 01:52:52.232
SUPPORT. AND THAT'S YOU KNOW

01:52:52.298 --> 01:52:53.299
THE MORAL SUPPORT THE

01:52:53.366 --> 01:52:54.901
LEGISLATIVE SUPPORT AND OF

01:52:54.968 --> 01:52:56.736
COURSE THE FUNDING. AND THE

01:52:56.803 --> 01:52:58.271
TRIBES ARE DOING ALL AYE THEY

01:52:58.338 --> 01:53:02.509
CAN IN IN MY COURT. TO ENSURE

01:53:02.575 --> 01:53:03.610
THAT THEY LOOK AT EVERY

01:53:03.676 --> 01:53:07.147
RESOURCE. BECAUSE THIS IS TRULY

01:53:07.213 --> 01:53:08.248
FOR THE MOST IMPORTANT RESOURCE

01:53:08.314 --> 01:53:08.948
WE HAVE AND THAT'S OUR

01:53:09.015 --> 01:53:11.584
CHILDREN. ON A DOWN GOING TO

01:53:11.651 --> 01:53:13.920
TURN OVER TO MY HOPE PRISONER

01:53:13.987 --> 01:53:14.521
WHO'S GOING TO PROVIDE A YOUTH

01:53:14.587 --> 01:53:19.859
PERSPECTIVE. HI I AM TO REALIZE

01:53:19.926 --> 01:53:20.460
FOR A AND I'M FROM THE SENATE

01:53:20.527 --> 01:53:21.594
BUT THE SENATE IS ABOUT

01:53:21.661 --> 01:53:22.462
RESERVATIONS HAVE BEEN SAN

01:53:22.529 --> 01:53:25.231
DIEGO BUT I'M ALSO FROM THE

01:53:25.298 --> 01:53:25.832
NUMBER OF THE RESERVATION. AND

01:53:25.899 --> 01:53:28.601
HOPING. AND I WANT TO SAY THANK

01:53:28.668 --> 01:53:29.202
YOU ALL FOR ALL OF YOU HAVING

01:53:29.269 --> 01:53:32.539
ME HERE AND I HAD THIS SPEECH

01:53:32.605 --> 01:53:33.039
PLANNED OUT BUT AS I WAS

01:53:33.106 --> 01:53:35.341
READING IT I REALIZED. MUCH

01:53:35.408 --> 01:53:36.242
MORE ISSUES THAT COULD HAVE

01:53:36.309 --> 01:53:38.811
BEEN SAID AND I NOTICED A LOT

01:53:38.878 --> 01:53:40.513
OF YOU WERE ASKING HOW TO HELP

01:53:40.580 --> 01:53:42.448
AND HOW. YOU GUYS CAN TAKE

01:53:42.515 --> 01:53:44.484
PART. BUT THE TRUTH IS THAT

01:53:44.551 --> 01:53:46.819
NATIVES KNOW EACH OTHER BETTER

01:53:46.886 --> 01:53:48.922
THAN ANYONE WE CAN HELP OUR

01:53:48.988 --> 01:53:51.624
COMMUNITIES BETTER THAN. ANY

01:53:51.691 --> 01:53:54.661
NON NATIVE CAN EVER AND IT'S.

01:53:54.727 --> 01:53:56.196
THE PROBLEM IS THAT AS I SAID

01:53:56.262 --> 01:53:58.231
I'M KIND OF AN ODD BALL NATIVE

01:53:58.298 --> 01:53:59.599
WHERE I LIVE OFF THE

01:53:59.666 --> 01:54:01.601
RESERVATION BUT- I A GO THERE

01:54:01.668 --> 01:54:03.369
ARE I GOT IT CULTURAL

01:54:03.436 --> 01:54:05.171
GATHERINGS ALMOST EVERY WEEKEND

01:54:05.238 --> 01:54:07.407
AND I'M UP THERE ALL THE TIME.

01:54:07.473 --> 01:54:09.142
BUT I'VE NOTICED THAT THERE'S A

01:54:09.209 --> 01:54:11.611
LACK OF MOTIVATION AMONGST ALL

01:54:11.678 --> 01:54:14.280
MY FRIENDS AND COUSINS. THEY

01:54:14.347 --> 01:54:16.549
FEEL AND WHAT THEY HAVE IN

01:54:16.616 --> 01:54:18.117
THEIR LIFE RIGHT NOW IS TO

01:54:18.184 --> 01:54:19.819
NORMAL FOR THEM WITH THE LACK

01:54:19.886 --> 01:54:22.722
OF MONEY. THE LACK OF THE

01:54:22.789 --> 01:54:24.657
SUPPORT FROM THEIR OWN PARENTS

01:54:24.724 --> 01:54:26.392
YOU KNOW DRIVING YOU KNOW THEY

01:54:26.459 --> 01:54:27.627
HAVE TO ASK PEOPLE TO DRIVE

01:54:27.694 --> 01:54:31.231
THEM TO THEIR OWN CULTURAL

01:54:31.297 --> 01:54:31.798
GATHERING THAT'S MAYBE THREE

01:54:31.864 --> 01:54:34.701
MINUTES DOWN THE ROAD. AND IT'S

01:54:34.767 --> 01:54:36.102
REALLY DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO

01:54:36.169 --> 01:54:38.271
FIND MOTIVATION LIVING ON THE

01:54:38.338 --> 01:54:40.540
RESERVATION. AS THERE'S NOT

01:54:40.607 --> 01:54:43.176
REALLY THAT MANY PROGRAMS THAT

01:54:43.243 --> 01:54:44.177
ARE NATIVE PEOPLE CAN THINK OF

01:54:44.244 --> 01:54:46.412
TO HELP EACH OTHER. WE'RE SO

01:54:46.479 --> 01:54:49.682
DIVIDED AND IT REALLY SHOWS AND

01:54:49.749 --> 01:54:51.851
THE GATHERINGS YOU KNOW. WHEN

01:54:51.918 --> 01:54:54.153
WE JUST HAD OUR CULTURAL

01:54:54.220 --> 01:54:54.721
GATHERING JUST NOT A COUPLE

01:54:54.787 --> 01:54:57.757
WEEKS AGO BUT- I'D SEE KIDS

01:54:57.824 --> 01:54:59.826
STAYED RATHER YOU KNOW SMOKE

01:54:59.892 --> 01:55:01.561
SOME WEED AND SAID OF TAKING

01:55:01.628 --> 01:55:04.297
PART IN THEIR OWN CULTURE AND-

01:55:04.364 --> 01:55:05.732
TO BE HONEST OUR CULTURE IS

01:55:05.798 --> 01:55:07.400
WHAT WE HAVE LEFT AND WHAT

01:55:07.467 --> 01:55:07.900
KEEPS US AS A COMMUNITY

01:55:07.967 --> 01:55:14.240
TOGETHER. WE OFTEN SEE. JUST

01:55:14.307 --> 01:55:15.975
THERE'S FIGHTS AYE GATHERINGS

01:55:16.042 --> 01:55:19.078
THERE'S YOU KNOW SOMEONE DOES

01:55:19.145 --> 01:55:20.713
ABOUT A HORSESHOE THEY GET MAD

01:55:20.780 --> 01:55:21.981
AT EACH OTHER AND THEY'D GO

01:55:22.048 --> 01:55:23.283
START GETTING INTO THIS WHOLE

01:55:23.349 --> 01:55:25.952
DRAMA ABOUT THEIR FAMILY WE'RE

01:55:26.019 --> 01:55:27.520
A DIVIDED COMMUNITY AND IT'S

01:55:27.587 --> 01:55:30.757
THE TRUTH AND- AS MUCH AS I

01:55:30.823 --> 01:55:32.892
LOVE MY CULTURE AND AS MUCH AS

01:55:32.959 --> 01:55:34.894
I LEARN FROM IT IT'S NOT GOING

01:55:34.961 --> 01:55:36.362
TO HOLD US ON TO FROM TOO MUCH

01:55:36.429 --> 01:55:39.766
LONGER. AND I JUST REALLY WANT

01:55:39.832 --> 01:55:42.702
TO. HAVE YOU GUYS REMEMBER THAT

01:55:42.769 --> 01:55:44.370
THESE PROBLEMS WE HAD THERE NOT

01:55:44.437 --> 01:55:45.905
JUST STORIES THAT WERE TELLING

01:55:45.972 --> 01:55:46.572
YOU THERE ARE REAL LIFE

01:55:46.639 --> 01:55:48.608
PROBLEMS AND THEY NEED TO BE

01:55:48.675 --> 01:55:49.142
SOLVED ONE WAY OR ANOTHER

01:55:49.208 --> 01:55:52.712
BECAUSE. WE'RE NOT NOTHING'S

01:55:52.779 --> 01:55:54.213
HAPPENING WE'RE JUST GOING

01:55:54.280 --> 01:55:55.815
DEEPER IN A HOLE THAT'S BEEN

01:55:55.882 --> 01:55:57.450
DUG FOR US OVER. THOUSANDS OF

01:55:57.517 --> 01:55:59.786
YEARS AND- IT'S REALLY NOT

01:55:59.852 --> 01:56:02.689
GETTING ANY BETTER AND- YOU

01:56:02.755 --> 01:56:04.557

TO SCHOOL THIS YEAR AND I'M

01:56:21.841 --> 01:56:24.544
STARTING SCHOOL TOMORROW. AND

01:56:24.610 --> 01:56:25.978
IT'S RELEASE SICKENING BECAUSE

SHE HAS TO PARENTS LIVING

01:56:28.181 --> 01:56:30.049

THEY WON'T GIVE HER A RIDE TO

01:56:45.498 --> 01:56:46.866
SCHOOL BECAUSE- THEY DON'T LIKE

01:56:46.933 --> 01:56:48.034
HER BECAUSE OF SOMETHING THAT

01:56:48.101 --> 01:56:49.769
HAPPENED MAYBE IN FIFTH GRADE.

01:56:49.836 --> 01:56:51.771
AND THEY'RE IN HIGH SCHOOL NOW.

01:56:51.838 --> 01:56:53.005
AND IT'S REALLY SICKENING

01:56:53.072 --> 01:56:55.007
BECAUSE- THESE KIDS ARE JUST

01:56:55.074 --> 01:56:56.109
LOOKING FOR AN OPPORTUNITY

01:56:56.175 --> 01:56:59.779
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING

01:56:59.846 --> 01:57:00.380
THEY CAN HOLD ON TO. THEY WANT

01:57:00.446 --> 01:57:04.884
OF. LIKE A LIGHT TO TURN ON AND

01:57:04.951 --> 01:57:05.785
THEY WANT SOMETHING TO HAPPEN

01:57:05.852 --> 01:57:06.352
BUT THE TRUTH IS NOTHING IS

01:57:06.419 --> 01:57:07.186
HAPPENING. AND AS MUCH AS OUR

01:57:07.253 --> 01:57:08.454
CULTURE MEANS SO MUCH TO US IN

01:57:08.521 --> 01:57:11.157
AS MUCH AS IT YOU KNOW. IT'S

01:57:11.224 --> 01:57:12.692
WHO WE ARE IT'S NOT SOLVING

01:57:12.759 --> 01:57:17.530
ANYTHING REALLY AND. IT'S THESE

01:57:17.597 --> 01:57:20.333
GANG MENTALITIES AND THESE YOU

01:57:20.400 --> 01:57:22.535
KNOW LIFE OF HATRED THAT WERE

01:57:22.602 --> 01:57:25.037
HOLDING ON TO BECAUSE THE TRUTH

01:57:25.104 --> 01:57:26.906
IS THAT WE DON'T REALLY THERE'S

01:57:26.973 --> 01:57:29.041
NOT MUCH AND I'M REALLY BLESSED

01:57:29.108 --> 01:57:30.410
THAT I WAS GROWING UP IN A

01:57:30.476 --> 01:57:32.578
COMMUNITY WHERE THEY ENCOURAGE

01:57:32.645 --> 01:57:33.846
COLLEGE IN THE ENCOURAGE HIGHER

01:57:33.913 --> 01:57:38.718
EDUCATION. BUT IT YOU CAN HAVE.

01:57:38.785 --> 01:57:39.886
A TRIBE CAN HAVE A CASINO THEY

01:57:39.952 --> 01:57:41.687
CAN HAVE ALL OF THAT BUT THE

01:57:41.754 --> 01:57:43.456
TRUTH IS THAT THOSE GANG

01:57:43.523 --> 01:57:45.725
MENTALITY STAY THERE AND THEY

01:57:45.792 --> 01:57:47.360
INFLUENCE OUR KIDS AND OUR

01:57:47.427 --> 01:57:48.561
PARENTS WERE INFLUENCE THE

01:57:48.628 --> 01:57:50.930
EXACT SAME WAY. THEY'RE NOT AS

01:57:50.997 --> 01:57:55.301
MUCH SUPPORT AS WE HAVE. SO I'M

01:57:55.368 --> 01:57:56.402
KIND OF GOING ALL OVER THE

01:57:56.469 --> 01:57:59.038
PLACE BUT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT

01:57:59.105 --> 01:58:02.074
THAT IT'S THE OUR USES OUR

01:58:02.141 --> 01:58:04.777
FUTURE LEADERS AND OUR USER AS

01:58:04.844 --> 01:58:06.879
THEIR SO UNMOTIVATED BUT THE

01:58:06.946 --> 01:58:08.114
TRUTH IS IT'S NOT JUST OUR

01:58:08.181 --> 01:58:09.549
YOUTH THAT NEEDS HELP IT'S ARE

01:58:09.615 --> 01:58:11.017
ADULTS THAT NEED HELP AND IT'S

01:58:11.083 --> 01:58:12.285
OUR ELDERS THAT NEED HELP ALSO

01:58:12.351 --> 01:58:15.087
WE WERE ALL CONFUSED AND WE'RE

01:58:15.154 --> 01:58:16.522
ALL DIVIDED AMONGST EACH OTHER

01:58:16.589 --> 01:58:18.691
AND OUR PARENTS BECAUSE HATE

01:58:18.758 --> 01:58:20.860
BETWEEN EACH OTHER'S FAMILIES

01:58:20.927 --> 01:58:22.462
AND WE GET INFLUENCED IF OUR

01:58:22.528 --> 01:58:23.062
PARENTS SAY THEY DON'T LIKE

01:58:23.129 --> 01:58:24.464
SOMEONE THE KIDS DON'T LIKE

01:58:24.530 --> 01:58:26.265
SOMEONE IT'S NOT JUST THE USE

01:58:26.332 --> 01:58:27.366
THAT WE SHOULD BE PAYING

01:58:27.433 --> 01:58:29.302
ATTENTION TO ITS EVERYONE AND

01:58:29.368 --> 01:58:32.305
WE NEED TO. HEAL OUR BROKEN

01:58:32.371 --> 01:58:35.408
COMMUNITIES AND JUST AS. WE

01:58:35.475 --> 01:58:36.209
NEED TO CALL ATTENTION AND

01:58:36.275 --> 01:58:39.445
PUBLICITY IS A- THE REALLY THE

01:58:39.512 --> 01:58:39.946
ONLY WAY TO GO FOR THIS

01:58:40.012 --> 01:58:43.716
SITUATION BECAUSE. WE AREN'T

01:58:43.783 --> 01:58:45.651
