CLEAN TECH BUSINESSES LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND THESE TO DEVELOP TO DEVELOP THE LIVE UP PROGRAM'S SUCCESSES. OUR GOAL THE CALIBRATION COLLUDING ACHIEVING THE HUMAN RIGHT TO WATER.

I'M EXCITED TO WORK COLLABORATIVELY WITH EACH OF YOU IN THE ENTIRE LEGISLATURE. TO ACHIEVE THESE GOALS THANK YOU I LOOK FORWARD TO ANSWERING YOUR QUESTIONS THIS AFTERNOON. THANK YOU VERY MUCH LET ME START WITH SENATOR MINING. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIRMAN. WELCOME MR BLUMENFELD AND CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR APPOINTMENT IN. ON A VERY DISTINGUISHED CAREER. I THINK WHEN WE TALKED YOU'VE WORKED AT THE CITY LEVEL. THE NATIONAL LEVEL. IN NOW FINDING A HOME AT THE STATE LEVEL. YOU MADE REFERENCE IN YOUR OPENING STATEMENT COMMITMENT. TO SECURING CLEAN SAFE DRINKING WATER IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE KNOW THERE'S ABOUT A MILLION RESIDENTS WITHOUT WHAT'S WHAT'S THE ROLE OF THE EPA. IN SECURING THIS FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHT. THE VESSEL JUST CONTEXTUALLY I MEAN IT'S KIND OF AMAZING THAT IN TWENTY NINETEEN AND AND MARLEY SHOCKING THAT WE WOULD HAVE A MILLION PEOPLE IN THE STATE AS WEALTHY AS OZ THAT DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER SO. IT'S BOTH AND URBAN AND THE RURAL PROBLEM -- IT IT IS FROM BOTH HISTORIC -- CONTAMINATION NITRATES AS WELL AS NATURALLY OCCURRING -- SUBSTANCES LIKE ARSENIC IN URANIUM SO IT RUNS THE GAMUT AND AND REALLY THE GENESIS OF THE PROBLEM IS THAT -- THE FACILITY THAT WE NEED IN ORDER TO CLEAN THE WATER TO MAKE IT SUITABLE PHùFOR DRINKING A VERY VERY EXPENSIVE. AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PROVIDES THE STATE WITH MONEY THAT ALLOWS US TO BUILD INFRASTRUCTURE BUT WE DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO PAY FOR THE OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE. OF THAT INFRASTRUCTURE SO THERE'S A GAP AND THE VERY SMALL COMMUNITIES OFTEN COMMUNITIES LESS THAN THAN TWO HUNDRED MEMBERS. I'M DOESN'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO PAY FOR THAT INFRASTRUCTURE IF YOU THINK ABOUT DIVIDING EVEN A SMALL BELL AMONG FORTY HOMES. THE MATH DOESN'T WORK OUT SO REALLY -- THIS ADMINISTRATION I KNOW IS IS WORKING WITH YOU IN THE LEGISLATURE. TO TO PUSH FORWARD -- SOLUTIONS THAT WOULD HELP FUND NO THE OTHERS THAT HASN'T BEEN LEGISLATED YET BUT THE PROPOSAL IS TO TO TRY AND SEE ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. THROUGH DIFFERENT MEHODS TO HELP PAY FOR THE OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE BOTH AND EVAN AND RURAL SETTINGS SO. IT'S IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WILL NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE DO -- WHEN I MEET WITH COMMUNITY MEMBERS -- IT'S NOT JUST DRINKING IT'S COOKING IT'S SHOWERING -- IT REALLY IS AT A STATE THAT WE NEED TO MOVE BEYOND. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE. YOUR FOCUS ON THAT IN N IN THAT EVERY YEAR AGENCY -- WHEN WE LOOK AT SOME OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL THREATS FACING NOT ONLY CALIFORNIA BUT THE PLANET THROUGH CLIMATE CHANGE? AIR QUALITY ISSUES. A NEW ABNORMAL OF FIRES IN THE IN THE STATE. IN LOOKING AT SOME OF THE ADVERSE IMPACTS. OF CLIMATE CHANGE AIR QUALITY. THEY OFTEN HIT HARDER ON DISADVANTAGED MINORITY COMMUNITIES. WHAT DO YOU SEE THE CHALLENGES IN YOUR AGENCY OF INCORPORATING ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE IN MINORITY COMMUNITIES IN THE? POLICIES AND PROGRAMS OF YOUR AGENCY SO WITH THE CHALLENGES IN. WHAT ARE THE OPPORTUNITIES WHAT WHAT CAN YOUR? TO MAKE YOUR APPROACH. TO CLEAN ENVIRONMENT -- MORE INCLUSIVE. WELL FIRST OF ALL THE THE LEGISLATURE IN CALIFORNIA IS REALLY LEAD ON THIS INITIATIVE BOTH IN THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FONG CONTACTS AND IN OTHER CONTEXTS. IN SETTING ASIDE FUNDING TO MAKE SURE THAT IT GOES TO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES -- THE OPPORTUNITIES A GREAT -- THERE'S A LOT OF LOCAL KNOWLEDGE A LOT OF I'M INTERESTED DESIRED TO MOVE THE ON THE CURRENT STATE OF ENVIRONMENTAL DIS. KIND OF THIS REPAIR IN THESE COMMUNITIES HAVE. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE REALLY IT'S ENGAGING COMMUNITIES LISTENING TO COMMUNITIES VISITING WITH COMMUNITIES AND WE THE THE AGENCY THAT I A HELP OVERSEE. HAVE LOTS OF DIFFERENT SUB AGENCIES GETTING THEM ALL TO WORK TOGETHER. I'M ACROSS THE AGENCY AND THEN GETTING THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO REALLY REALIZE THAT PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN SMALL COMMUNITIES THEY JUST SEE GOVERNMENT YOU KNOW THEY SEE. THEY DON'T DISTINGUISH THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT STATE GOVERNMENT FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SO IT'S INCUMBENT ON US TO REALLY WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE THAT WITH DELIVERING PROGRAMS IN A PLACE. RATHER THAN JUST THINKING ABOUT. YOU KNOW THESE WE NEED TO CLEAN THE AIR WE NEED TO CLEAN THE AIR IN OB IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE IT HAS THE WEST EQUALITY IN THE NATION BY FAR -- SO THAT IS THE KIND OF AYE AYE PLACE BASE INITIATIVE TO SOMETHING THAT I BELIEVE AND STRONGLY THE THE TWO MAIN LEVELS THAT WE HAVE A FUNDING. SO MAKING SURE ALL THAT THE COMMUNITIES THAT NEED HELP MOST GET HELP FAST. AND THEN SECONDLY ENFORCEMENT OFTEN IN THESE COMMUNITIES. THESE LAWS THAT YOU'VE HELP PASTA CONGRESS'S HELP HAAS I'M A NOT ENFORCED ADEQUATELY SO MAKING SURE THAT THE COMMUNITIES THAT NEED THE HELP. REALLY GET BOTH THE FUNDING AND THE ENFORCEMENT SO THAT BUSINESSES IN THOSE DISTRICTS NO YOU KNOW WHAT THEY HAVE TO PLAY BY THE SAME RULES. AS BUSINESSES AND THE REST OF THE STATE. THE THE LAST ELEMENT THAT I WOULD SAY IS REALLY MAKING SURE THAT OUR PROCEDURES A WELCOMING SOMETIMES IT'S INTIMIDATING. THE COME TO SACRAMENTO I'M AND VOICES ON THE HEAD AND AND REALLY ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE IS ABOUT. BEING ON THE POLITICAL MARGINS AND ON THOSE MARGINS WE NEED TO BRING PEOPLE INTO THIS AND ENCOURAGE THEM. THAT THEY DO HAVE A A WILLING PARTNER THAT IS GOING TO LISTEN AND ACT. ON THE ACTIONS THAT THEY SUGGEST SO I THINK IT'S A IT'S A CULTURAL. ISSUE AND AND FROM MY OBSERVATIONS CALIFORNIA'S DOING. THE BEST JOB OF ANY STATE IN THE NATION ON THIS ISSUE -- THE STILL A LOT TO DO. THANK YOU I'M. I COULD GO ON A LOT OF QUESTIONS JUST BECAUSE I'VE ENJOYED OUR INNER CHANGES AND JUST WHAT I SEE IS A REAL. VISION MATCHED WITH THE ORGANIZATIONAL CAPACITY BUT I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR -- CENTER BATES. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- MR ROOM FIELD WE HAVE SUCH A NICE DISCUSSION THE OTHER DAY WHEN MY FIRST READING UP ON OF THE YEAR -- COME INTO MY OFFICE BUT I HAD A FEW FOLLOW UP AND I THINK I'VE SHARE THAT WITH YOU. AND I'D LIKE TO GO BACK TO THE CLEAN WATER SAFE WATER AND THE IMPACTS THAT WE SEE COMING FROM -- IN THE A COMMUNITY AND THEIR CONCERNS WE REALLY NEED A BALANCED AND I THINK WE SHARED. OUR DISCUSSION ON THAT BUT YOU DID INNOT ONE OF YOUR COMMENTS Là. OF MADE A COMMENT ABOUT LIMITING THE NITRATE -- FROM OUT OF THE FERTILIZER THAT FARMERS CAN USE AND I I'M LOOKING AT THAT AND WONDERING HOW YOU MIGHT ACCOMPLISH THAT THERE ARE BE SEVERAL MEANS OBVIOUSLY FEES TAXES OR SOME SORT OF RATIONING OR LIMITING OF OF FERTILIZER USE COULD YOU. EXPAND ON THAT ARE A COMMUTER I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR ON THE RECORD SOME COMMENTS. ABOUT THE MEANS BY WHICH WE CAN APPROACH THAT BUT IT CERTAINLY -- IN IN TERMS OF PROTECTING BOTH SIDES OF THE ISSUE. THAT EIGHT AFTER THE DEBATE. THE ISSUE OF HOW OLD THAT HUNDRED FORTY MILLION -- IS ARRIVED AT IS IS OBVIOUSLY A LEGISLATIVE ISSUE -- IN TIME TO THE PRESENT LEGISLATION THAT THAT -- OF THE SENATE A MONNING IS OF IS AN EXPERT ON THIS BUT I'LL I'LL SPEAK. BRIEFLY TO THE GENESIS OF THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE AG COMMUNITY PARTICULARLY IN THE SAN JOAQUIN. I'M AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AND FARM WORK A COMMUNITY THERE'S AN AGREEMENT THAT. THAT HAD BEEN LEGACY NITRATE POLLUTION NO ONE DISAGREES ABOUT ISSUES -- THE QUESTION IS. TWO FOLD ONE HOW HOW TO PHAM IS GET SHORTY THAT IF THEY'RE IN CURRENT COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW. THAT THEY WON'T BE SUBJECT TO ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS THAT DEAL WITH THE HISTORIC POLLUTION AND SECONDLY HOW DO WE FIND -- DRINKING WATER -- FULL DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND SO THE COMPROMISE OF THESE GROUPS WHICH IS REALLY HAS STARK IN CALIFORNIA AND I WANT TO GIVE A LOT OF PRAISE TO THEM. WHATEVER THE EVENTUAL OUTCOME THEY CAME TO LOT LET'S ENDEL THIS ANTAGONISM AND M. IF WE PUT A FEE ON FERTILIZES. THAT ARRIVES AT ABOUT THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR IN EXCHANGE THERE WILL BE A PROVISION TO HOLD. LEGACY CONTAMINATION FROM NITRATES HARMLESS -- WHERE THOSE -- FARMERS ARE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THAT CURRENT REGIMES OUT IS ACTUALLY OF A PRETTY AMAZING COMPROMISE I'M GONNA GIVES ME A LOT OF I'M POLLS TO TO FEEL GOOD ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO SELL THESE COMPLEX ISSUES BECAUSE WHEN FARMERS AND FARM WORKERS COME TOGETHER AND COME OUT WITH THESE SOLUTIONS. IT'S IT'S ALL FOR THE BETTER SAYS. I'M IN IN TERMS OF GOING FORWARD SENATE -- WE DO NEED TO MAKE SURE ALL THAT WE KEEPING A WATCHFUL EYE AND WORKING CLOSELY WITH COMMAS TO MAKE SURE ALL. THAT CURRENT PESTICIDE USE ISN'T POLLUTING FUTURE GROUND WATER BECAUSE AS WE FOUND OUT THIS IS EXTRAORDINARILY EXPENSIVE. EXTRAORDINARILY EXPENSIVE TO FIX -- AND WILL ALSO NEED TO SHOWN THE THE COMPANIES THAT MAKE THEM THAT THE WE WANT TO LOOK FOR ALTERNATIVES THAT ON TOXIC TO GROUND WATER. THANK YOU I'LL WE ALL LIVE THE WORD COMPROMISE THAT'S HOW WE GET GOOD POLICY AND ARE CERTAINLY GREAT LEADERS HELP US GET THERE LIKE. THE LEADERSHIP YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE OVER AT KELLY PA ONE LAST QUESTION I HAVE IS FOCUSING ON THE HOUSING -- CONCERNS THE AND OBVIOUSLY TO SEE CLARA. AND ALL I KNOW AND I WAS -- PART OF ON NEVA YOU ARE AWARE THE DON'T ALLOW ANONYMOUS -- CHALLENGES UNDER NEPA. WOULD YOU BE OPEN TO ENTERTAINING THAT OUT FOR SEQUEL LAWSUITS WHICH CURRENTLY CAN BE FILED ANONYMOUSLY. ARE THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS NOT BE ALWAYS BASED IN THE COMMUNITY -- WHERE THE IMPACTS ARE HAPPENING IT CAN BE OUTSIDE AGENCIES FOR WHATEVER PURPOSE WE WOULD HOPE IT'S ENVIRONMENTAL BUT MANY TIMES WE FOUND THAT IT'S NOT NECESSARILY THAT SO COULD YOU? ADDRESS THAT AND YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT HAVING SERVED IN ALL WHEN AGENCY THAT DOESN'T ALLOW IT AND COMING TO ANOTHER ONE THAT THAT STILL DOES. YEAH I'M I'M NOT FLUENT ENOUGH -- TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THE GENESIS OF WHY ONE SYSTEM HAS AND A NUMBER THE MAYBE IT'S A WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTIONS ON OPTIONAL WHAT THE THE REASONS ARE BACK. DOZEN TIMES OF THESE ACTS WHICH GET A LOT OF ATTENTION RELIEF FOR ME THE THE MAN GOAL IS IS TO LOOK AT ENVIRONMENTAL TENTATIVE -- AND THEY'VE YOU KNOW THEY'VE MORPHED INTO DIFFERENT THINGS OVER TIME BUT THE REAL GOAL IS TO SAY. THIS IS THE PROPOSED PROJECT OTHER OUT OF THE ARE THERE IMPACTS TO THAT. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS ON THAT PROJECT AND IS THERE AN ABILITY TO COME OUT WITH A CLEAR SIGHTED VIEW OF ALTERNATIVES AND TO ME THAT'S THE THE ROOT OF BOTH THE NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ACT AND AND SEA QUEST. AND YET AS ACTIVITY I TOLD ABOUT OUTSIDE OF GOVERNMENT BETWEEN HOME BUILDERS. AND ORGANIZED LABOR AND ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS TO LOOK AT HOW THE HOW TO THINK ABOUT THIS IN THE HOUSING CONTACTS INSTANTLY. IF US TO PLAY A ROLE IN THAT WILL WILL BE CONSTRUCTIVE IN. IN TRYING TO MEET THOSE TWIN GOALS -- I WAS THE PROCESS YOU KNOW WE ARE INVOLVED IN PROCESS LADEN. WHACK AND AND AND MY GOAL WITHIN CALLIE PA IS TO REALLY LOOK AT WHAT THE VALUE PROPOSITION WHERE WE WHERE WE GETTING MEANINGFUL ENVIRONMENTAL GAINS. AS OPPOSED TO IN MANY COMMUNITIES THAT JUST FEELING LIKE THAT IS CONTINUOUS REGULATION THAT DOESN'T PROVIDE GAINES SO I'M GONNA LOOK FOR WAYS OF CREATING EFFICIENCY. I'M STARTING IN THE PHAM COMMUNITIES I'VE MET WITH COMMAS AND EACH INDIVIDUAL PIECE OF REGULATION MAY MAKE SENSE BUT WHEN YOU ALL INDIVIDUAL FARMER IT'S TOUGH. WHEN IT'S? BUT THREE ALLOWED A BOX AND IT'S VERY THICK SO. I'M I THINK WE NEED TO WE NEED. TO KEEP THE INTEGRITY M. OF THE PROTECTIONS BUT HELP. TO MAKE THE PROCESS MORE EFFICIENT. THANK YOU FOR LOW FLORA RESPONSES SO RIGHT ON APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR BATES LET ME -- HEAD OVER TO SENATOR ROTH. THANK YOU MAYOR PRO TEM. NO QUESTIONS REALLY JUST A COUPLE COMMENTS BUT FIRST A SIR LET ME CONGRATULATE YOU ON YOUR A NOMINATION I WANTED GENERALLY SAY THAT I'VE BEEN VERY VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE QUALITY OF THE NOMINEES. PUT FORWARD BY THIS GOVERNOR AND THEN FELL YOU ARE CERTAINLY NO EXCEPTION OPTIONALLY WELL QUALIFIED I I HAD THE WE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF HAVING A A WIDE RANGING CONVERSATION AND IN MY OFFICE ABOUT. KELLY PA'S CHALLENGES THE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS PROGRAM AND METRICS DE TSC. AND PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANTLY GIVEN. OF WHERE IT IS ON THE PRIORITY AROUND HERE IN THE BUILDING WATER QUALITY ISSUES AND SOLUTIONS. AS YOU KNOW I HAVE SOME GENERAL CONCERNS -- SURROUNDING THE IMPOSITION OF A WIDELY BASED WATER FEE BUT I I RECOGNIZE CLEARLY THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM AND THAT WE NEED TO ARRIVE AT A SOLUTION. SO I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU. TO TALK ABOUT THE FUNDING A PROPOSALS THAT COME FORWARD AND ALTERNATIVES TO THOSE AND TOGETHER WITH MY COLLEAGUES IN THE GOVERNOR -- WE WILL FIND A SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM SO CONGRATULATIONS AGAIN AND I LOOK FORWARD TO MOVING YOUR A NOMINATION AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU SIR. THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU A MAN PRO TEM I THOROUGHLY ENJOYED OUR CONVERSATION AND I'M GLAD YOU'RE AS EXCITED AS I AM ABOUT INDUSTRIAL HAVE. AND THERE'S BEEN A REVOLUTION OR EXCITED NOW. AS YOU SHOULD BE AND NOT ALWAYS GONNA REVOLUTIONIZE AGRICULTURE IN CALIFORNIA BUT LESS WATER THE MOST CROPS. THE PRESSURES CARBON LITTLE TO NO PESTICIDES BECAUSE IT LITERALLY IS A WEED AND OUR REMEDIATE READ REMEDIATE THE SOIL AND I HOPE YOU CAN COME DOWN AND JOIN ME IN APRIL WHEN WE PLANT THE FIRST INTERNATIONAL HAVE BEEN CALIFORNIA MY DISTRICT -- I KNOW NOW I'M A NOW VALLEY SO IT'S BEEN FOR A HUNDRED SINCE NINETEEN THIRTIES BIN AND A VALLEY FAIR ENOUGH SOUTH OF POSSIBLE I SEE A DAY WHEN IS THAT VALLEY FAIR AND HIM FESTIVAL. BE GOOD FOR A TOURISM TO HEY HI [inaudible] FLETCHER. ANYWAY SINCE WE SINCE WE MET THERE WAS A A POLITICAL ARTICLES LIKE I WANT TO KIND OF FOLLOW UP ON THAT SO. IN THAT YOU MENTIONED THAT YOUR INTEREST ABOVE -- CARBON EMISSIONS AND GLOBAL WARMING IS IS -- THE YOU KNOW. AIR QUALITY AS IT PERTAINS LIKE OZONE AND A AND PM AND SO I'M JUST WONDERING WHAT YOUR STRATEGY IS GOING TO BE TO TRY TO GET US INTO ATTAINMENT. THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION YEAH SO BASICALLY MY EMPHASIS I'M. IS REALLY TO TO LOOK AT COMMUNITY NEEDS I'M AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE CLEAN AIR ACT -- CALIFORNIA OBVIOUSLY WAS A PRECURSOR TO THE CLEAN AIR ACT BACK IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES. THE LA BASIN HAD SUCH POOR AIR QUALITY THAT PUSH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND NINETEEN SEVENTY PRESIDENT NIXON SIGNED INTO LAW THE CLEAN AIR ACT SO. FROM THAT POINT UNTIL NOW WE HAVE NOT ATTAINED. I'M COMPLIANCE WITH THE FEDERAL CLEAN AIR ACT -- AND EIGHT THOUSAND PLUS PEOPLE DIE YET JUST FROM PM TWO POINT FIVE EXPOSURE. SAYS. EIGHT IT'S NOT AN EITHER OR IT'S YOU KNOW WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT WHAT WE CAN DO. TO TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS LET'S FOCUS ON THE THINGS THAT ALSO REDUCE CRITERIA POLLUTANTS LIKE KNOX. I'M SAID EXAMPLE BE YOU KNOW THAT PHAM EQUIPMENT IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY IF YOU CAN REDUCE. I'M THE EMISSIONS FROM VERY OLD FARM EQUIPMENT THAT HELPS YOU KNOW THE PHARMACY SAVE MONEY I'M IT'S A MUCH MORE EFFICIENT VEHICLES SO IT'S LESS POLLUTION. ABOUT GREENHOUSE GASES AND CRITERIA POLLUTANTS AND IT HELPS THE COMMUNITIES SURROUNDING. THEM SO REALLY IT'S THAT WAS OF A VERY APPROPRIATE FOCUS ON ON GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. I THINK I AM WE NEED TO RE ENGAGE A LITTLE BIT MORE ON THE CRITERIA POLLUTANTS I'M AND TO YOUR QUESTION IT'S IT'S VERY. THE THE TARGETS IN THE CLEAN AIR ACT VERY AGGRESSIVE FROM A WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE ASH ADD IN BOTH SOUTH COAST AND THE SAN JOAQUIN. YOU KNOW THAT A LOT OF POLLUTION JUST MOVES UP AGAINST THE FOOT HILLS AND IT AND IT GETS TRACKED THAT SO. THEY HAVE THE MOST AGGRESSIVE -- CLEAN AIR LAWS IN THE WORLD IN THOSE AREAS BUT WE FRANKLY HAVE TO DO MORE ON ON THINGS LIKE WOOD STOVES -- IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY AND IN THE CASE OF SOUTH BECAUSE REALLY DOES NEED TO LOOK AT COMBUSTION ACROSS THE BOARD WHETHER IT'S MOVING FREIGHT -- AS WE TALKED ABOUT 41% OF UNITED STATES CUMMINS COMES INTO THE SAN PEDRO PARKS -- WE CANNOT WE CAN MAKE THAT A LOT OF THAT. ZERO THAT. WHEN YOU MAKE SOMETHING ZERO EMISSIONS NEAR THE PORT? IT'S HELPING THOSE PORT COMMUNITIES. AND REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS WHERE THAT OTHER OF THE MISSIONS WHICH IS JUST PURELY GREENHOUSE GAS RELATED THAT ON HELPING COMMUNITIES AS MUCH SO. THE MY GOAL BE TO LOOK AT THE INTERSECTION OF THOSE. SO I I HAVE ONE FOLLOW COULD JUST TO KIND OF YOU LISTED IT IT'S SO I WOULD SO FARM BUREAU SECTOR THIS WEEK SO I KNOW THIS IS TRUE I WAS TALKING WITH A GENTLEMAN LAST NIGHT. AND HE SAID IN TERMS OF THE THE DIESEL IT ENGINE ENGINES AT THE USE AND AND FARMING EQUIPMENT. THAT THE THE FUNDING THIS YEAR IS DOWN FROM WHAT IT'S BEEN FROM THE PRIOR ADMINISTRATION IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO YOU KNOW CHANGE OUT THOSE. THOSE ENGINES SAID TO MAKE IT YOU KNOW RIGHT LESS YOU KNOW. THIS CHARGE WAS POLLUTANTS IS THAT IS THAT TRUE AND IS THERE A WAY CONSIDERING. THE BUDGET SURPLUS WE'RE GONNA HAVE THAT WE CAN MAYBE RE PRIORITIZE THAT. AS AN ADDITIONAL SEVENTY SOMETHING THAT I'M ENGAGED ACTIVELY IN DISCUSSING. RIGHT GREAT AGAIN LOOKING FOR TO VOTING FOR YOU AND CONGRATULATIONS. THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIRMAN I THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE HI. I JUST WANT. TO COVER A COUPLE OF THINGS MOSTLY AS COMMENTS BECAUSE MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ASK. OUR RELEVANT QUESTIONS I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET WITH YOU YESTERDAY -- EXTENSIVELY TO GO OVER THE LONG LIST OF THE CRITICAL ISSUES. THAT YOU ARE WILL OVERSEE AND OUR MOST CRITICAL DEPARTMENTS AT THIS AND THEY'RE ALL REALLY IMPORTANT. DEPARTMENTS I I REALLY APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS ON THE CLIMATE TARGETS AND COMPLIANCE. AND THE FACT THAT THE QUESTIONS ASKED BY MY COLLEAGUES ABOUT -- THE LOWER INCOME COMMUNITIES I IMPACTED COMMUNITIES AG AREAS AND HOW TO SUPPORT I AND AND THAT THOSE THOSE ISSUES AROUND RESOURCES AND FUNDING WE WILL TAKE UP DURING% THE BUDGET CONVERSATIONS. AS IT RELATES TO THE CAP AND TRADE DOLLARS -- AND OTHER THINGS SO I LOOK FORWARD TO THAT DISCUSSION. HI AND MAKING SURE THAT WE CONTINUE -- TO USE THOSE RESOURCES IN A FAIR AND EQUITABLE WAY WITH OF VARIOUS COMMUNITIES INCLUDING. I AG COMMUNITIES FARMING EXCEPT TRUCK. AS WELL AS URBAN COMMUNITIES WHERE THERE ARE DISADVANTAGED AND AND THE PROGRAMS THAT SUPPORT. THOSE AT WE DIDN'T HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT THIS MAYBE THIS BECAUSE I AM THE BORDER REPRESENTATIVE OUT WELL AS CLOSE AS CAN BE -- WE YOU JUST BRIEFLY -- TO THE CHALLENGES ALONG THE BORDER -- IT DIDN'T HAVE TO BE EXTENSIVE BUT THE THE FOCUS ON SOME OF THE WORK WE'RE DOING ABOUT CROSS BORDER ISSUES AROUND A NUMBER OF ISSUES THAT WE TALKED ABOUT. AS TO THE THE BORDER THE U. S. MEXICO BORDER GETS A LOT OF ATTENTION A LOT OF IT ISN'T ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT BUT IF. YOU LIVE ON EITHER SIDE OF THAT BORDER THE ENVIRONMENT TO VERY. BIG FOCAL POINT. SAYS MAYBE START WITH THE WATER ISSUES. ALL THE RIVER AS INTO THE US IN IN CALIFORNIA FLOW FROM SOUTH TO NORTH WE OFTEN THINK THAT THEY'RE GONNA FLY THE OTHER DIRECTION BACK. FROM THE NEW RIVER TO THE TIJUANA RIVER -- THOSE THE THE POLLUTION THAT'S COMING FROM MEXICO INTO THE U. S. IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES IN SAN DIEGO SADLY ON THE BEACH CLOSURES. YOU KNOW FROM SEWAGE IN TIJUANA IT'S SOMETHING -- THAT WAS A BIG CONCERN OF MINE AT UNITED STATES ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY AND AND WE PUT HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. INTO WASTE WATER TREATMENT I'M IT'S GETTING BETTER IT'S CERTAINLY NOT GOOD ENOUGH AND WE NEED A LOT OF CROSS BORDER COLLABORATION TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. NOT ONLY IS THIS SEWAGE BUT IF YOU GO INTO THE T. O. YOU KNOW YOU'RE WALKING ON FIVE OR SIX FEET OF TRASH ON THE ALL FEET -- AND YOU KNOW THE AS CALIFORNIANS IS SOMEONE THAT HAS A LOT ABOUT THE OCEAN. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT PACIFIC GARBAGE PATCH A LOT OF THAT IS COMING YOU KNOW FROM FROM THAT PART OF? OUR STATE -- SO ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING AT IS CLOSER COLLABORATION WITH BOTH BAJA AND MEXICO CITY TO TO TREAT THESE ISSUES IN A IN A SERIOUS WAY. I'M ON THE NEW RIVER -- THE NEW REVISED FEEDS RIGHT INTO THE SELDOM SEE. THE SALTY OBVIOUSLY IS A VERY HIGH PRIORITY FOR THIS ADMINISTRATION. THE THE WATER GOING INTO THE SALTON SEA FROM THE NEW RIVER IS VERY TOXIC THERE'S A PROGRAM THAT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT PIPING IT. SO THAT THE FUMES ON EXPOSING NEIGHBORS -- IN CALEXICO AND THEN THE IN IMPERIAL COUNTY IMPERIAL COUNTY HAS VERY SIGNIFICANT ISSUES AT A SIZEABLE NUMBER OF THOSE COME FROM. MEXICO A SIZEABLE NUMBER OF THOSE ALSO COME FROM IMPERIAL COUNTIES SO. SOMETIMES CONVENIENT TO BLAME MEXICO BUT WE ALSO NEED TO MAKE SURE OUR OWN HOUSES IN ORDER. I'M. SO WHEN THE THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD HAS SENT MONITORS. AND MONITORS AND WHAT WE FOUND IS IT'S A LOT OF TRASH BANNING. I'M IN -- MEXICALI AND AND SO COMING OUT WITH JUST SIMPLE WASTE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES COULD SIGNIFICANTLY HELP THE AIR QUALITY IN CALIFORNIA. I ANI I APPRECIATE I YOUR EXPERIENCE AND I WILL SAY -- IT WAS REALLY AN ENJOYABLE ALMOST OUR TALKING TO ABOUT ALL OF THESE ISSUES AND THE UNDERSTANDING. THAT YOU HAVE IN THE DEEP DIVE ON SO MANY ISSUES FROM. THE CLIMATE TARGETS BORDER POLLUTION RECYCLING WHICH I WILL NOT. I WILL NOT DO TO YOU TODAY -- BECAUSE I THINK WE HAD A LONG CONVERSATION ABOUT THE CHALLENGES THAT WE ARE GOING TO NEED TO MEET. IN THAT ARENA BUT THE EIGHT THAT YOU HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF OF THE BROAD GLOBAL ISSUES AROUND WHAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO IN CALIFORNIA. I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE -- SENATOR ROTH ON ISSUES AROUND THE WATER FIX AND IN PARTICULAR AS THIS ADMINISTRATION PROCEEDS WITH OUR WITH ITS REVISIONS. ARE I WANT TO BE SURE THAT. YOU KNOW WE'RE ABLE TO BE KEPT CLOSELY IN THE LOOP AS IT RELATES TO OUR WATER AGENCIES IN PARTICULARLY I'M CONCERNED ABOUT. SAN DIEGO OF COURSE ARE THE CONFIGURATION AND THE COST OF THE PROJECT I THINK. MANY OF US WANT TO SEE HOW THAT PROCEEDS. AND IT WILL YEAH AGAIN THESE ARE ALL CRITICALLY IMPORTANT ISSUES THAT'S WHY I THINK YOU SEE SO MANY PEOPLE IN THE ROOM TODAY. AND I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO PUT ON THE RECORD FOR THE PUBLIC BECAUSE WE SPEND EACH OF US. ARE QUITE A BIT A TOM PRIOR TO THIS MEETING TO MAKE SURE WE PUT ON YOUR RADAR SCREEN THE ISSUES THAT ARE MOST IMPORTANT TO OUR CONSTITUENTS IN THE MOST INTERESTING THING IS. MOST OF THESE ISSUES ARE STATEWIDE WE MAY COME AT IT FROM A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE REGIONALLY ON ANY NUMBER OF THESE ISSUES BUT ULTIMATELY. I EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT YOU OVERSEE WITHIN THE VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS OUR STATE WIDE ISSUES AT SOME LEVEL SO IT MAKES IT A LOT MORE COMPLICATED I THINK. BUT YOUR EXPERIENCE YOUR EXPERTISE YOUR KNOWLEDGE AND YOUR ABILITY TO REALLY ENGAGE IN SUBSTANTIVE CONVERSATIONS WE ARE VERY FORTUNATE -- THAT THE GOVERNOR WAS ABLE. TO MAKE DISAPPOINTMENT AND WITH THAT I CONCUR WITH THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUES. AND WILL ASK IF THERE IS ANYONE HERE ARE IN SUPPORT THAT WOULD LIKE TO COME FORWARD THERE IS A MICROPHONE.

AFTERNOON MEMBERS OF THE RULES COMMITTEE I AM HONORED TO APPEAR BEFORE YOU TODAY AND I'M GRATEFUL FOR THE TIME THAT YOU SPENT MEETING WITH ME PRIOR TO THIS HEARING. I APPRECIATE THE CHANCE TO SHOW MY VISION AND ENJOYED OR CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE LABOR AGENCY. I AM THE DAUGHTER OF IMMIGRANTS. MY MOM WHO BRAVED A THIRTY DAY VOYAGE ON A CARGO SHIP TO COME HERE FROM CHINA BECAUSE SHE COULDN'T AFFORD A PASSENGER TICKET. CAME TO AMERICA OF OPPORTUNITY AND THEN SETTLED WITH MY DAD IN THE STATE SYNONYMOUS WITH DREAMS. SHE AND MY DAD FLEW UP FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TO BE HERE TODAY. WHILE I WAS GROWING UP MY FAMILY OWNED A LAUNDROMAT AND DRY CLEANING BUSINESS AND LATER AN ICE CREAM SHOP. I KNOW THE STRUGGLES OF SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS WHO ARE THE ENGINES OF OUR ECONOMY AND THE VITAL ROLE THAT THE STATE CAN PLAY IN HELPING THEM TO THRIVE. FOR THE PAST EIGHT YEARS I SERVE THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA AS LABOR COMMISSIONER. I WORKED WITH AN INCREDIBLE TEAM OF DEDICATED PUBLIC SERVANTS. TO COMBAT WAGE THEFT AND TO PROMOTE ECONOMIC JUSTICE THROUGH ROBUST ENFORCEMENT OF LABOR LAWS I I KNOW THAT ARE SEE I SAW DURING THAT TIME THAT. WITH A CLEAR VISION. BOLD IDEAS AND A REAL COMMITMENT TO MAKING GOVERNMENT WORK THAT WE CAN TRANSFORM WHAT WE DO AND HOW WE DO IT. AS LABOR SECRETARY I WILL MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY ON MY TEAM REJECTS THE IDEA THAT WE HAVE TO DO THINGS THIS WAY BECAUSE WE'VE ALWAYS DONE THEM THIS WAY. ALSO AS LABOR COMMISSIONER I SAW THAT BY ENCOURAGING CREATIVITY. TEAMWORK AND BY NEVER ASKING MY STAFF TO WORK HARDER THAN I WAS WILLING TO WORK. WE MADE A TREMENDOUS IMPACT EVEN WITH LIMITED RESOURCES. AS LABOR SECRETARY THIS MEANS THAT I WILL MAKE SURE WE ARE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN WITH THE RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE BEFORE ASKING FOR MORE MONEY OR MORE STAFF. AND I SAW THAT FOR THE LOWEST PAID WORKERS IN OUR STATE. WHO OFTEN WORK CRUSHING HOURS? UNDER BRUTAL CONDITIONS. THAT WE CAN DO BETTER BY THEM. WHEN WE TREAT THEM WITH RESPECT AND DIGNITY THAT THEY DESERVE WE CAN NOT ONLY SUCCEED IN PUTTING EARNED WAGES INTO THEIR POCKETS? BUT WE CAN BUILD THEIR FAITH IN THE VERY IDEA OF GOVERNMENT ITSELF. MY TWO DAUGHTERS ARE ALSO HERE TODAY. LI MEI IS A FIRST YEAR AT YALE AND HAS PLAYED MARY POPPINS ON STAGE. AND I'M LIVING IS A HIGH SCHOOL SOPHOMORE WHO ALSO PARTICIPATES IN MUSICAL THEATER BUT WHOSE FIRST LOVE IS COMPETITIVE CLUB BASKETBALL. THEY AND I ARE PRODUCTS OF THE CALIFORNIA DREAM. I THINK OF THE NEW SOME FOR THE CHANCE TO WORK WITH HIM TO PRESERVE AND EXPAND THAT DREAM. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO MY PARTNERSHIP WITH ALL OF YOU IN THE YEARS AHEAD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M GONNA. SWING OVER HERE TO MY RIGHT AND ASK SENATOR ROTH IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO START US OFF THIS TIME THANK YOU MAYOR PRO TEM -- CONGRATULATIONS. TO EXCEPTIONALLY WELL QUALIFIED FOR THIS JOB IS YOU KNOW IN MY PAST LIFE I WAS A CUSTOMER OF THE AGENCIES THE ONE THAT YOU. HEADED UP BEFORE IN THE AGENCIES THAT YOU NOW WILL SUPERVISE. THE SECRETARY AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WATCHING. HOW YOU WORK AND HOW YOU DEVELOP AND? HOW YOU ACCOMPLISH THE PRIORITIES THAT YOUR PRIORITIES THAT WE HAD THE PLEASURE TO DISCUSS DURING OUR OFFICE MEETING [inaudible] I I'M ALSO LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU TO AS WE INDICATED I INDICATED TO YOU DURING OUR MEETING. SECURING A REGULAR IN CONSTANT CONSISTENT FUNDING FOR OUR VETERANS EMPLOYMENT PLACEMENT PROGRAMS INCLUDING OUR STATES WORK FOR WARRIORS PROGRAM. WORKING. TO UTILIZE THE WHAT APPEARED TO BE ACCUMULATED PAGA FUNDS. OF TO EXPAND EMPLOYER OUT REACH BECAUSE DURING MY TIME AS A IMPLEMENT PRACTITIONER AND LAWYER IN THE STATE NOW FORTY FIVE YEARS. OF IT. I FIND IT TO SMALL EMPLOYERS HAVE A VERY VERY DIFFICULT TIME. UNDERSTANDING WHAT THEY'RE REQUIRED TO DO THE LAWS THAT WE PASS THE REGULATIONS THAT THE AGENCIES IMPOSE. AND I THINK IT MIGHT BE A GOOD USE OF SOME OF THAT PAGANINI TO EXPLAIN EXPAND AND EMPLOYER OUT REACH IN THE STATE AND I KNOW. THAT YOU SHARE THAT VIEW AND THAT YOU INTEND TO STEP OUT. ON THAT AS WELL [inaudible] AND FINALLY. TAKING A LOOK AT HOW WE HAVE CONNECTED OUR CAREER TECH EDUCATION PROGRAMS IN THIS. STATE FROM THE EDUCATION CONSORT CONTROL SURE THAT WERE SET UP A COUPLE YEARS AGO. AND PERHAPS EULOGIZING THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD'S OR SOME SIMILAR ENTITY TO COLLECT AND COMPILE AN INVENTORY OF JOB SKILL NEEDS AND AND POSITION NEEDS IN THE STATE. AND BETTER CONNECT THE DEMAND SIDE WITH THE EDUCATIONAL COMPONENT. OF C. T. E.. I KNOW THE YOU SHARE THOSE PRIORITIES AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING WHAT YOU'RE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH WHEN. YOU ARE CERTAINLY CONFIRMED FORWARD TO MAKING THAT MOTION TO CONFIRM THAT NOMINATION AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME CONGRATULATIONS. HOW MUCH SENATOR? MISTER VICE CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. I'M IN PRESSURE NO LONGER -- CHAIR OF BUDGETS OF FOUR YOU'RE STILL ADVOCATING. THAT'S GREAT. THOROUGHLY ENJOYED OUR CONVERSATION I'M I'M GONNA SHOOT A QUESTION THAT I ASKED YOU TO PRIVATELY JUST BECAUSE I THOUGHT WAS REALLY INTERESTING IN IN TERMS OF PAGA. AND WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS TO TRY TO ADDRESS THAT SO. IF YOU COULD DO THAT I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE IT SO THE PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S ACTOR PAGA WAS A STATE LAW PASSED IN RECOGNITION OF THE FACT THAT GOVERNMENT DIDN'T HAVE ALL THE RESOURCES TO ENFORCE ALL OF THE LABOR LAWS. AND SO THE IDEA WAS THAT IT GAVE INDIVIDUALS A CHANCE TO GO TO COURT TO COLLECT STATE PENALTIES. AND THEN 75% OF WHAT THEY COLLECTED WILL GO TO THE STATE AND 25% WOULD GO TO THE PLAINTIFF WHO BROUGHT THE SUIT. A FEW YEARS AGO THE LEGISLATURE PASSED. A LAW TO HELP THE LABOR AGENCY TO BETTER DOCUMENT HOW PULGAS WORKING WHAT ABUSES THERE ARE AND WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING TO CURB THEM. SO OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS AFTER THE LABOR AGENCY HAS BEEN DOING WE NOW -- GET ONLINE NOTICES FROM EVERY PLAINTIFF WHO WANTS TO FALL UPON THE SUIT WERE SUPPOSED TO GET ALL OF THEM WE ARE STILL WORKING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ACTUALLY OF THAT THIS FULL UTILIZATION OF THE SYSTEM. BUT THEN WE HAVE A CHANCE TO LOOK AT THE WHETHER WE WILL TAKE ANY OF THEM FOR INVESTIGATION. WE HAVE DONE THAT ALTHOUGH AS I WAS UP FRANK IN OUR CONVERSATION IS STILL A VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THE NOTICES THAT WE ACTUALLY TAKE INSIDE TO INVESTIGATE -- AND THEN AFTER THAT NOTICE THE PLATE TO FILE SUIT AND WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE TRACKING OF THE OUTCOMES OF THOSE CASES WE NOW GET SETTLEMENTS BEFORE THEY ARE FINALIZED SO WE HAVE A CHANCE TO LOOK AND SEE. ARE ALL THE ISSUES THAT WERE ALLEGE ACTUALLY -- BEING RESOLVED OUR IS THE STATE GETTING THE PENALTIES THAT WE SHOULD BE GETTING AND ARE THESE CASES FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE PA THE STATUTE WHICH IS TO MAKE SURE THAT LABOR LAWS ARE BEING ENFORCED. WHEN THE GOVERNMENT IS UNABLE TO STEP IT? UP AND WE'RE ALSO REALLYLOOKING AT TRACKING TRENDS AND ABUSE THAT'S GOING ON SO WE'RE LOOKING TO SEE WHETHER THERE ARE OF CERTAIN PARTY CERTAIN ATTORNEYS WHO ARE. CONSTANTLY FILING THE SUIT TO WEAR THOSE OUTCOMES ARE NOT CONSISTENT WITH UP WITH PAGA -- PURPOSES AND SO WE'RE TAKING A CLOSE LOOK AT THAT WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT AND I I WE HAD A REALLY REALLY GREAT CONVERSATION ABOUT THE CONCERNS THAT EXIST AS I DID WAS SENATOR BATES. AND SO -- WE'RE VERY HOPEFUL THAT THROUGH THE INFORMATION GATHERING AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND WORKING WITH PARTIES IN THE STATE TO GIVE US FULL INFORMATION THAT WE WILL BOTH -- PROMOTE THE RIGHT PURPOSE THE PAGA AND CURB THE THE OVER THE TO JUSTICE THAT -- IS A PROBLEM ESPECIALLY FOR SMALL BUSINESSES FOR DEVOTING EYEING CONGRATULATIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. Q. SENATOR BAIT. WELL CONGRATULATIONS MISS SUE AND AM THANK YOU -- FOR THAT I THINK VERY ILLUMINATING TIME THAT WE HAD TO YOU KNOW CONVERSATIONS ABOUT SOME OF THESE. I CONSIDER THEM VERY VEXING PROBLEMS BECAUSE WE WANNA CERTAINLY PER TAPPED ON YOU KNOW OUR ON THE PLAYERS OUT THERE BUT IT WAS IMPORTANT LEAN ENSURE THAT THERE ARE NOT ABUSES SOB FOR EMPLOYEES AND THAT'S THAT'S A DIFFICULT THING TO NAVIGATE ON CERTAINLY AND SIGNED PLEASED TO HEAR THAT -- YOU'RE GATHERING THE DATA THAT I THINK WILL BE VERY IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF FUTURE LEGISLATION THAT MIGHT CORRECT -- ABUSE AND I THINK WE TALK TO SOMEONE ABOUT GIVING SOME OPPORTUNITY FOR CARRYING A ON AN ABUSE -- THAT WAS NOT INTENDED THAT WOULD CERTAINLY HELP AND I CAN GIVE CONFIDENCE FUND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE. SURE THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE HAVE A GREAT CONFIDENCE IN THEIR GOVERNMENT IN TERMS OF THE WAY THEY REGULATE. IN TERMS OF THE WAY THEY ARE SOLVE PROBLEMS THAT ONE THAT IS GOING TO BE ON A HUGE AND CONTINUES TO BE HUGE AND WE SPOKE I THINK IT'S REAL IMPORTANT. THE THE MOST ON I THINK THREATENING THING ABOUT DYNAMAX AT THIS POINT IS THIS RETROACTIVE PROVISION OF POTENTIAL. IN I'D LIKE TO KNOW ON YOU KNOW IT CAN BE VERY CATASTROPHIC ON SOME BUSINESS IN PARTICULAR SMALLER BUSINESSES. OUT WOULD YOU BE SUPPORTIVE OF ANY REFORM THAT GOES IN THE DIRECTION OF DEALING WITH THE RETROACTIVITY AND SOMEHOW BOB. YOU KNOW SITTING A TIME LINE SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL. I IN TERMS OF THIS APPLICATION IF THERE'S NOT A MAJOR REFORM OR WEEK I KNOW THERE'S LEGISLATION OUT THERE LOOKING OUT. REPEALING AT AND GOING BACK TO MORE DOWN LOWER CODIFYING THAT MAKE THIS RETROACTIVITY THING IS WHEN I CONTINUE TO HEAR FROM THE FOLKS THAT COME. TO MY OFFICER THAT I NEED IN THAT AND IN THE DISTRICT OF SO I'M GOING FORWARD YOU GOT A NEW LAW WE GOT TO FOLLOW THAT. ARE MAJOR CHANGE FROM WHAT USED TO BE HOW ARE WE GOING TO BE PROTECTED SO COULD YOU EXPAND ON MATTER. AT LEAST GIVE US SOME PATHWAY THAT WE MIGHT ALL CONSIDER **** WE TRY TO DO WHAT I JUST SAID BALLOTS [inaudible] AXEL. THE ISSUES OF MISS CLASSIFICATION THAT WERE DRESSED IN DYNAMICS OF CERTAINLY DID NOT -- BEGIN WITH DYNAMAX AND IS A LOT ALL BY DYNAMIX BUT IN THAT UNANIMOUS SUPREME COURT DECISION THE COURT BASICALLY RECOGNIZE THAT MISS CLASSIFICATION. IS A SERIOUS THREAT TO BOTH EMPLOYEES AND THOSE WHO SHOULD ENJOY THE PROTECTIONS OF OUR LABOR LAWS AS EMPLOYEES. AS WELL AS TO BUSINESSES WHO SHOULD NOT BE FORCED INTO A RACE TO THE BOTTOM RIGHT -- WHEN IT COMES TO OF THE THE COSTS AND THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF RUNNING A BUSINESS? AND THAT DECISION ADOPTED A MORE SIMPLIFIED A. B. C. TEST FOR DETERMINE WHETHER SOMEBODY IS AN EMPLOYEE OR INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR. AND WHAT IT DID WAS BUILT ON SOME EXISTING CASE LAW ABOUT ONE OF THE THREE DEFINITIONS IN THE WAGE ORDERS TO SUFFER PERMIT STANDARD. AND SO WE IN THIS ADMINISTRATION ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS A QUESTION THAT'S BIGGER THAN DYNAMAX THAT IS ABOUT WHAT IS THE UP FOR A PROMISE THAT OF THE THAT WE WANT TO MAKE TO EMPLOYEES AT THE CALIFORNIA TO PEOPLE WORKING CALIFORNIA. WHERE THE STANDARDS THAT WE WANT TO EXIST REGARDLESS OF STATUS AND HOW DO WE PRESERVE THE ABILITY FOR BUSINESSES TO BE INNOVATIVE AND FLEXIBLE AND TWO ADOPTED CHANGES IN THE ECONOMY? AND THOSE OF THE BALANCES THAT WE ARE ALL TRYING TO STRIKE IT'S A CHALLENGE. THAT I THINK WILL BE ONE THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS WE DEAL WITH. IN CONJUNCTION WITH YOU THE LEGISLATURE IN THIS ADMINISTRATION AND WE HAVE HAD A AN OPEN DOOR POLICY ABOUT THIS I'VE MET WITH -- FOLKS ON ALL SIDES OF THE ISSUE RIGHT EMPLOYEES -- AND UNIONS WHO ARE DEDICATED TO PRESERVING THE PROTECTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN SO HARD -- EMPLOYERS AND THOSE IN THE INDUSTRY MOST DIRECTLY AFFECTED BY THE DYNAMIC DECISION WHO -- FRANKLY WANT FLEXIBILITY AND ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT THEY WANT A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD. AND SO WILL CONTINUE THOSE CONVERSATIONS AS YOU MENTIONED CENTER THERE IS LEGISLATION ALREADY IN THE WORKS AND I WILL BE DEDICATED TO ENFORCING WHATEVER -- IS IS PASSED I WILL SAY ON THE RETROACTIVITY ISSUE -- I THINK THAT. FOLLOWING THE CASE THERE WAS A REQUEST TO THE COURT. TO FIND THAT THE DECISION SHOULD BE PROSPECTIVE ONLY AND THE COURT OF DID REFUSE TO TAKE THAT STEP -- AND SO AT THIS POINT WE'RE JUST LOOKING AT ALL THE ISSUES THAT WE TALKED ABOUT AND TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO WHAT IS BOTH FAIR AND JUST AND ALSO CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WITH WHAT THE COURT DETERMINED AND WE'RE STILL LOOKING ALL THOSE ISSUES. THANK YOU FOR YOUR RESPONSE AND CERTAINLY I THINK YOUR COMMITMENT TO DIG A LITTLE DEEPER INTO IT AND AND CERTAINLY AND SHE MORE OR TRY TO ACHIEVE THE ON THE BALLOT SO I KNOW THAT YOU ARE WELL. NOTED FOR YOUR ABILITY TO SEE COMPROMISE AND HE IN THE SOLUTION OT. SO WE WE SHOULD THE BILL CLOSELY AND CONGRATULATIONS AGAIN SENATOR MINING. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND WELCOME IS TO OWN AND OFFER MY CONGRATULATIONS AS WELL ON YEAR APPOINTMENT BY THE GOVERNOR. AND ALSO WELCOME YOUR PARENTS AND YOUR DAUGHTER'S I'M SURE THEY'RE VERY PROUD TO BE HERE ODAY IS I KNOW YEAR EQUALLY PROUD OF THEM -- YOU HAVE AN AMAZING BACKGROUND IN. IS A CAL BEAR I EVEN HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU GOT A GOOD FOUNDATION AT STANFORD IT LOOKS LIKE -- FOR AN AMAZING CAREER YOUR EIGHT YEARS -- AS LABOR COMMISSIONER -- CERTAINLY GIVES YOU AN AMAZING. UNDERSTANDING OF OUR STATE IN. THE FORCES OF BUSINESS AT ALL DIFFERENT LEVELS AND WORKERS UNIONIZED IN. NON UNIONIZED IT CETERA. ON I KNOW YOU PRESIDED AS LABOR COMMISSIONER WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE REQUIREMENT FOR FARM LABOR CONTRACTORS TO PROVIDE SEXUAL HARASSMENT PREVENTION TRAINING. SO IF YOU COULD PROVIDE THE COMMITTEE A BRIEF UPDATE ON YOUR VIEWS ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT PROTECTION FOR FARMWORKERS. HAPPY TO DO THAT SO THANK YOU TO THE SENATOR FOR THAT LEGISLATION -- THE IT WAS A REQUIREMENT THAT OF FARM LABOR CONTRACTORS -- EDUCATE NOT JUST SUPERVISORS BROSSEAU EMPLOYEES ON HOW TO PREVENT SEXUAL HARASSMENT -- AND THAT LAW WHEN THE LAW FIRST WENT INTO EFFECT I SENT A NOTICE OUT -- TO THE AFFECTED COMMUNITY. LABOR CONTRACTORS WHO WE HAD REGISTERED -- WITH THE WITH THE LABOR COMMISSIONER TO INFORM THEM OF THE REQUIREMENTS. AND AND WE ALSO CONTACT WITH SOMEONE IN MY OFFICE TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE OR OR CONTINUING OF CONSULTATION ON ON SOME OF THE NEW REQUIREMENTS AND I THINK THAT'S RELATED. TO HOW WE HELP ON BUSINESSES TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO COMPLY WITH THE WITH THE IMPORTANT POLICIES THAT ARE PUT FORTH UP FROM THIS BODY. AND JUST THIS PAST WEEK WE ISSUED OUR FOR CITATIONS FOR EMPLOYERS FARM LABOR CONTRACTORS WHO HAD NOT PROVIDED THAT EDUCATION. AND I THINK WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS NOT ONLY THAT WE GIVE EMPLOYERS NOTICE THAT WE GIVE THEM TIME TO COMPLY BUT THEN ALSO THAT WILL FORCE THE LAWS THAT THAT HAVE BEEN WRITTEN. AND THAT'S BOTH IMPORTANT TO THE SPECIFIC EMPLOYEES AFFECTED BUT ALSO TO SEND A STRONG MESSAGE THAT WE ARE SERIOUS ABOUT THE BASIC STANDARDS THAT WE WANT TO EXIST IN CALIFORNIA AND WE WANT A WORKING PEOPLE AND AND THEIR BUSINESS. HONEST. COMPETING TO ENJOY SO IF YOU CITING THE TRAINING OF FEAR TO PROVIDE -- THE INFORMATION THAT WAS PART IN THE TRAINING AND OUR HOPE IS THAT THAT WILL ALSO HAVE A RIPPLE EFFECT AND ENCOURAGE. OTHER FLC IS WERE NOT. ALREADY IN COMPLIANCE -- TO TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE WE ALSO INTRODUCED A NEW FORM ON THE LABOR COMMISSION'S WEBSITE THAT WOULD ALLOW PEOPLE WHO KNOW THAT THE TRAINING IS NOT TAKING PLACE TO SPECIFICALLY LET US KNOW ABOUT THAT SO WE REALLY TRY TO UPGRADE OUR ABILITY. FOR ONLINE ACCESS TO OUR SERVICES DURING MY TIME AS LABOR COMMISSIONER AND MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE FORMS THAT ARE EASY TO UNDERSTAND AND TRANSLATED AND EASY TO USE WAS A KEY PART OF BECOMING MORE ACCESSIBLE AS GOVERNMENT. WE DO HAVE A SPECIAL FORM ALSO FOR THAT PARTICULAR VIOLATE FREE ONE I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP WITH THAT AND AS YOU MENTIONED -- ONE OF THE FEATURES OF THAT IMPLEMENTATION IS TO GIVE FARM LABOR CONTRACTORS THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMPLY. THE AGENCY'S GOAL IS TO ACHIEVE THE TRAINING IN THE PROTECTION OF THE WORK FORCE. IN THAT THE PENALTY PHASES ARE LATER AFTER. NOT -- REFUSING TO COMPLY BASICALLY -- WE ALSO TALKED SOME ABOUT THE UNDER WE KNOW THAT LITERALLY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR IS CHANGING HANDS BUT OFTEN WITH. WORKERS NOT BEING PAID. WHAT THEIR DO AND OFTEN? LAW ABIDING EMPLOYERS. BEING PUT AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE BY THOSE WHO ARE NOT PLAYING BY THE RULES -- DURING YOUR TENURE AN ISSUE MOVE FORWARD. WELL WHAT CAN BE DONE -- WHAT HAS BEEN DONE FOR BETTER COORDINATION AMONG THE VARIOUS ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES IN SHARING INFORMATION AND DATA AND? ALSO. PUBLICIZING WHERE YOU HAVE FOUND VIOLATORS SO THAT OTHERS WHO MIGHT BE TEMPTED TO CUT CORNERS REALIZE THAT THERE WILL BE CONSEQUENCES. AS LABOR COMMISSIONER -- I REALLY MOVED THE AGENCY AWAY FROM THE SWEEPING METHOD OF ENFORCEMENT MEANING YOU'RE MORE INSPECTIONS THE BETTER AND RANDOM INSPECTIONS. BUT WE REALLY MOVED TO A TARGETED MORE STRATEGIC APPROACH MEANING WE WERE LOOKING AT EMPLOYERS BASED ON INFORMATION WE GATHERED AHEAD OF TIME BASED ON PARTNERSHIPS -- ON THE GROUND FOR THOSE WHO WERE ALREADY BREAKING THE LAW. AND THAT MAKES SENSE IT'S JUST GOOD GOVERNMENT RIGHT WE DON'T WANT TO BE INSPECTING EMPLOYERS WERE PLAYING BY THE RULES THERE'S NO REASON. FOR THEM TO HAVE TO STOP THEIR BUSINESS FOR INSPECTION IT'S NOT A GOOD USE OF GOVERNMENT SOURCES IT DOESN'T-HELP WORKERS -- AND WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE GOING TO THE WORST VIOLATORS AND FINDING. ALL OF THE WAY THE LAW MAKING LAWBREAKING COSTLY AND THEN TRYING TO CHANGE BEHAVIOR. AND SO THAT WAS OUR POST UNDERGROUND ECONOMY AND I'M REALLY EXCITED TO EXPAND THAT MODEL ACROSS THE LABOR AGENCY. TO REALLY LOOK AT HOW WE CAN BE MORE STRATEGIC AT EVERY LEVEL SO THAT WERE USING GOVERNMENT RESOURCE IN A SMART WAY -- SO THAT WE ARE GOING TO WEAR THE BAD ACTORS ARE WHEN I CAME WHEN I BECAME LABOR COMMISSIONER. ROUGHLY HALF A LITTLE BIT LESS THAN HALF OF ALL INSPECTIONS LED TO A CITATION OF ANY KIND. WHICH MEANS THAT ABOUT HALF OF INSPECTIONS WERE NOT OF ANYBODY THAT WAS EITHER THE LAW WAS NOT BEING BROKEN OR THEY WERE BEGIN DOING ENOUGH TO FIND IT. AND IN THE LAST EIGHT YEARS WE HAVE GREATLY IMPROVED IN THAT AREA WE ARE BETWEEN 8090% OF THE INSPECTIONS THAT WE DO ACTUALLY IS ALL TODAY CITATION. AND IN THE STRATEGIC APPROACH WE WORK WITH COMMITTEE BASED PARTNERS TO TALK TO WORKERS OFFSITE BEFORE WE DO AN INSPECTION WHERE WE LOOK DEEPLY FOR DO WE DO COMPLEX WAIT AUDITS TO FIND OUT WHETHER WORKERS. IT WOULD WORK BECAUSE OF THE BIG GUY WHICH IS HOW MUCHTHEY'RE OWED IN THOSE CASES WE'RE AT ABOUT A 100% RATE IN TERMS OF OUR INSPECTION TO CITATION. SO THAT BETTER TARGETING IS JUST IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S SMART AND IT'S GOOD ENFORCEMENT IS IS WITH WHAT HAS GAINED SUPPORT FROM BOTH EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYERS FOR FOR OUR ATTACK ON THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY. THANK YOU IN IN JUST A FINAL POINT ON THAT I BELIEVE. YOU'RE AGENCIES ALSO AVAILABLE TO EMPLOYERS IF THEY KNOW A COMPETITORS BREAKING THE RULES THAT CAN ALSO GET THE ATTENTION. OF THE AGENCY ABSOLUTELY RIGHT Q. SENATOR MINING -- YOU KNOW ON ALONG THE STANFORD CAL COMIN I JUST WANT TO KNOW. IF YOU'RE ABLE TO LIKE MITIGATE BETWEEN THE HARVARD YALE SITUATION AT HOME. A SERIOUS QUESTION. THERE'S A SMILE SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE ANSWER TO THAT IS -- QUICKLY A BECAUSE I THINK MY COLLEAGUES HAVE BEEN PRETTY GOOD TO COVER SOME PRETTY IMPORTANT ISSUES. AND OF COURSE -- YOUR RESPONSES AT THAT YOU PROVIDED THE RULES COMMITTEE AND IT'S CLEAR FROM LISTENING TO YOU YOU'VE YOU'VE REALLY GOT A HANDLE. ON ALL OF THE RELEVANT ISSUES OF THE DEPARTMENTS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO OVERSEE. ANY COMMENTS ON WORKERS COMPENSATION ISSUE I I MEAN I KNOW THIS IS. JUST GETTING STARTED IT'S THE ONE THING I HEAR ABOUT -- IT WHEN I'M UP AND DOWN THE STATE TALKING TO ANY GROUP OF BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS YOU WE DID A LOT OF WORK.% I WELL THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION. TO TRY TO ADDRESS SOME ISSUES BUT I I STILL HERE SO I GUESS IT'S FROM WHAT PERSPECTIVE YOU SAID. ARE THERE ISSUES YOU THINK ARE THAT WE NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT AN ADDRESS -- AND AGAIN IT DEPENDS LARGE SMALL BUT JUST FROM THE BROAD VIEW. SO I WILL SAY THAT FROM WHERE I SIT AND AS YOU NOTED I'M STILL LEARNING -- AND I'M STILL GETTING FAMILIAR WITH ALL ASPECTS OF THE JOB. BUT THE LEGISLATION THAT WAS PASSED A FEW YEARS AGO HAS RESULTED IN IMPROVEMENTS SO I WOULD SAY WE'RE ON THE RIGHT TRACK WHEN IT COMES -- TO WORKERS COMP REFORM AND MAKING SURE THAT THE MAIN PRIORITIES OF OUR WORKERS COMP SYSTEM WHICH IS TO INSURE THE INJURED WORKERS GET THE TREATMENT THAT THEY NEED TO GET BACK TO WORK AS QUICKLY AS THEY CAN. AND THAT WE CONTROL COSTS FOR EMPLOYERS THAT THOSE TWO GOALS. ARE BEING MET THEHAVE IMPROVEMENTS IN THAT AREA DUE TO THE CHANGES LEGISLATIVE CHANGES THAT WERE PASSED A FEW YEARS AGO -- WITH THINGS LIKE INDEPENDENT MEDICAL REVIEW WE'VE CUT DOWN THE TIME TO RESOLVE MEDICAL DISPUTES DRAMATICALLY -- FROM WHAT WAS NINE TO TWELVE MONTHS AND NOW IT'S LIKE THIRTY TO FORTY FIVE DAYS. AND SO THOSE ARE IMPROVEMENTS IN THE SYSTEM WE ARE ALSO UPGRADING OUR OUR DATABASE ARE SO THROUGH THAT. I AM VERY DATA DRIVEN ABOUT HOW WE SHOULD DO OUR WORK SO I WILL BE LOOKING CLOSELY WITH MY DEPARTMENT OF MY DIVISIONS AT WHAT THE DATA TELLS US. WHAT WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT ANY ONGOING ABUSES PROBLEMS FRICTION IN THE SYSTEM THINGS WE NEED TO IMPROVE AND -- CERTAINLY TRYING TO ADDRESS ALL OF THOSE TO THE BEST OF MY ABILITY. WELL THANK YOU I WILL BE INTERESTED AS YOU GET UNDER WAY IN THIS NEW -- POSITION. AS YOU TRAVEL THE STATE CERTAINLY I HAVE HEARD FROM -- SILICON VALLEY ORANGE COUNTY OF MY OWN COMMUNITY IN SAN DIEGO STARTING FROM THE TIME WHEN I WAS SPEAKER AND STARTED TO DO THOSE. CONVERSATIONS THAT WHILE THERE HAVE BEEN MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS AND I TRIED TO FOCUS IN ON THE SPECIFICS WHEN PEOPLE WOULD MAKE COMMENTS. AND IT SEEMS TO BE THE MID TO SMALL SIZE BUSINESSES HAVE COMMENTS NOW I KNOW WE CANNOT PLEASE EVERYONE IN THAT BALANCING ACT OF OF HOW YOU ADDRESSES ISSUES BUT I'D BE INTERESTED IN OUR AFTER A PERIOD OF TIME TO COME BACK TO YOU AND ASK YOU WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS. ARE ON THAT. AND THEN AS WE YOU KNOW I'M GONNA KNOCK ON WOOD EVERYONE KEEPS PREDICTING A DOWNTURN IN THE ECONOMY YOU KNOW I I AND I KNOW IT SOME POINT THAT WILL ALWAYS BE THE CASE. BUT WE HAD CERTAINLY ISSUES IN THE LAST. NUMBER OF YEARS -- TWO THOUSAND EIGHT NINE TEN AROUND EIGHTY D. AND AT THE WORK FORCE ABILITY TO RESPOND. TO OUR CITIZENS AROUND UNEMPLOYMENT AND ACCESS TO THE DEPARTMENT SO MUCH SO THAT I THINK THE EMPLOYEES WERE REALLY SUFFERING FROM MORALE BURN OUT. ALL THOSE THINGS AND STRIKE TEAMS HAD TO BE SENT ND BE HELPFUL I AM. HOPEFUL THAT ALL OF THAT IS MUCH BETTER GRANTED YOU'RE IN THE POSITION NEWLY MUCH BETTER BUT MUCH LIKE OUR RAINY DAY FUND PREPARES US FOR A A YOU KNOW IF THERE IS A DOWNTURN -- FOR A SOFTER LANDING OF SUCH WILL EDT HAVE THE ABILITY. TO ARE NOT BE PUT BACK IN THE SAME POSITION WITH THE LEVEL OF STAFFING EMPLOYEES. AND HAVE WE RECTIFY THAT TO THE DEGREE THAT WE ARE WILL BE ABLE TO APPROACH ANYTHING COMING UP. BETTER SUITED THEM WE WERE IN THE LAST. SO THAT IS DEFINITELY A HIGH PRIORITY FOR FOR FOR ME AND FOR THIS ADMINISTRATION -- I THINK THAT THERE ARE TWO APPROACHES THAT ONE IS THAT WE DO NEED TO GUARD AGAINST THAT KIND OF DOWNTURN -- WE APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT THE LEGISLATURE UPGRADING ALSO THE EDT SYSTEM WE THINK THAT THAT WILL THAT WILL OBVIOUSLY HELP AND AND AND SOFTEN THE BLOW. I THINK THAT THE OTHER PIECE OF THIS IS THAT THERE IS THERE ARE TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITIES CREATED BY THE BY THE INVESTMENTS THAT WILL BE MADE. IN THE YEARS TO COME AND YOU KNOW IN IN IN CLIMATE WHICH WHICH WHAT WAS JUST DISCUSSED IN HOUSING AND INFRASTRUCTURE -- AND ALL OF THESE GREAT OPPORTUNITIES FOR GROWTH AND FOR GOOD JOBS AND SO UNDER THE LABOR WORKFORCE AGENCY WE ALSO HAVE ALL THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT WORK WHICH IS ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE ALIGNING. THE SKILLS ABILITIES IN THE TALENTS OF CALIFORNIANS WITH THE JOBS THAT WE HAVE AND WITH GOOD HIGH QUALITY FAMILY SUPPORTING JOBS. AND SO THE MORE WE CAN DO THAT THE MORE WE GUARD AGAINST THE DOWNTURN ALTOGETHER BY CREATING THE MOST ROBUST ECONOMY WE HAVE. WHERE WE INSURE THAT A WE USED CALIFORNIANS FOR THE WORK THAT WE NEED AND MAKE SURE THEY'RE TRAINED AND SKILLED AND CONNECTED TO EMPLOYERS TO DO THAT? AND SO I THINK THAT'S A PART OF THE ANSWER BUT ASSUMING THAT THERE THAT THERE ARE GREATER NEEDS ON UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE SIDE I'M VERY COMMITTED TO WORK WITH EASY TO MAKING SURE THAT WE CAN. PROVIDE BENEFITS IN A TIMELY AND QUICK AND ACCURATE MANNER AND CERTAINLY ARE. GIVEN YOUR HISTORY SUPPORT THE STAFF. ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU -- SENATOR ROTH AND PRO TO MESS ABSOLUTELY COMMON QUESTION. MADAM SECRETARY WE'VE BEEN STE WE SPENT A LITTLE BIT OF TIME TODAY TALKING ABOUT ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS WHETHER IT'S IN THE AG INDUSTRY OR OTHERS. AND I'M ALL FOR ENFORCEMENT THAT'S WHAT MAKES OUR ECONOMY RUN THAT'S WHAT KEEPS THINGS COMPETITIVE AND KEEPS THINGS FAIR -- BUT AS I MENTIONED BEFORE BRIEFLY I DO THINK AND I WOULD ASK YOU TO TAKE A LOOK AT HOW WE DISSEMINATE INFORMATION REGARDING THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE WORKPLACE IN CALIFORNIA TO EMPLOYERS BOTH LARGE AND IN PARTICULAR SMALL. NEWSPAPERS ARE NOT WHAT THEY USED TO BE IT IS THE INTERNET AGE BUT NOT ALL OF OUR SMALL BUSINESS. MEN AND WOMEN OPERATORS ARE INTERNET SAVVY OR HAVE ACCESS TO THE INTERNET. AND I'M NOT SURE THAT IS SUFFICIENT ANYMORE. TO PRINT A A NOTICE RESEARCHERS OF NOTICES THAT WE POST ON A BULLETIN BOARD SOMEWHERE. AND THEN EXPECT THE EMPLOYMENT COMMUNITY IN COR COMMUNITY TO UNDERSTAND WITH SMALL EMPLOYERS. WHAT THEY NEED TO DO TO COMPLY THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO TRY TO AVOID INVADE? AND THE THEY SHOULD BE CAUGHT AND THEY SHOULD BE APPROPRIATELY PUNISHED. AND IN SOME CASES PUT OUT OF BUSINESS BUT WHAT I HATE TO SEE. IS THE GOTCHA. WHERE? GOVERNMENT AGENCIES DON'T DO AS MUCH AS THEY CAN TO DISSEMINATE THE INFORMATION. BEFORE THEY COME IN WITH THE ENFORCEMENT TEAM. AND SLEPT PENALTIES ON TO GREECE SMALL BUSINESS SO.
