DURING THIS BILL- I WANT TO

01:19:54.089 --> 01:19:55.724
RECOGNIZE THAT THE WORK IN THE

01:19:55.790 --> 01:19:57.392
SOCKS IN THE CONVERSATION THE

01:19:57.459 --> 01:20:00.028
DIALOGUE THAT WENT INTO THIS- I

01:20:00.095 --> 01:20:02.297
THINK THAT- AND HAS HAS BEEN

01:20:02.364 --> 01:20:04.399
RECOGNIZED BY SOME OF THE

01:20:04.466 --> 01:20:06.434
PREVIOUS. WITNESSES IN BOTH

01:20:06.501 --> 01:20:08.537
SUPPORT AND OPPOSITION THIS

01:20:08.603 --> 01:20:10.172
BILL DOES NOT SOLVE EVERY

01:20:10.238 --> 01:20:13.308
SINGLE. TENANT LANDLORD HOUSING

01:20:13.375 --> 01:20:14.943
ISSUE THAT WE HAVE BECAUSE OF

01:20:15.010 --> 01:20:16.344
BECAUSE OF IT BUT WHAT IT DOES

01:20:16.411 --> 01:20:18.079
DO IS IT PRESENTS THE ONLY

01:20:18.146 --> 01:20:19.748
VEHICLE FOR THE CALIFORNIA

01:20:19.814 --> 01:20:27.822
STATE LEGISLATURE. SULFUR

01:20:27.889 --> 01:20:31.193
EVERYTHING IT DOES CREATE A

01:20:31.259 --> 01:20:33.261
BETTER OPTION THAN NO OPTION

01:20:33.328 --> 01:20:34.729
THOSE ARE THE TWO THAT'S THE

01:20:34.796 --> 01:20:35.931
DOES OF THE TWO THINGS THAT THE

01:20:35.997 --> 01:20:37.732
LEGISLATURE HAS IN FRONT OF US

01:20:37.799 --> 01:20:39.768
WE EITHER HAVE NO INACTION

01:20:39.834 --> 01:20:40.936
WHICH MEANS MILLIONS OF

01:20:41.002 --> 01:20:43.505
INDIVIDUALS- COULD BE LEFT

01:20:43.572 --> 01:20:46.007
WITHOUT A HOME- STARTING. IN A

01:20:46.074 --> 01:20:48.944
FEW DAYS OR WE VOTE ON A

01:20:49.010 --> 01:20:51.613
MEASURE THAT REQUIRES THAT WE

01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:53.415
CONTINUE THE DIALOGUE BUT IT

01:20:53.481 --> 01:20:55.417
DOES HELP A PORTION OF THOSE

01:20:55.483 --> 01:20:57.419
MILLIONS OF INDIVIDUALS SO I

01:20:57.485 --> 01:20:58.687
WANT I THINK- ALL OF THOSE

01:20:58.753 --> 01:21:00.689
INVOLVED I KNOW THAT-

01:21:00.755 --> 01:21:02.757
CERTAINLY- WE HEARD THAT

01:21:02.824 --> 01:21:03.959
THERE'S MORE THAT NEEDS TO BE

01:21:04.025 --> 01:21:07.395
DONE- AS WE LOOK AHEAD TO WHAT

01:21:07.462 --> 01:21:09.497
COMES AHEAD. AND AS WE TRY TO

01:21:09.564 --> 01:21:11.700
PREDICT THE UNKNOWN WE DON'T

01:21:11.766 --> 01:21:12.767
KNOW EVERYTHING THAT IS COMING

01:21:12.834 --> 01:21:14.903
BEFORE S. AND SO I ABSOLUTELY

01:21:14.970 --> 01:21:16.938
EXPECT THAT THIS IS A TEMPORARY

01:21:17.005 --> 01:21:17.806
SOLUTION AND THAT WE WILL BE

01:21:17.872 --> 01:21:20.008
BACK- WHEN THE LATE WHEN THE

01:21:20.075 --> 01:21:21.676
LEGISLATURE RECONVENES TO

01:21:21.743 --> 01:21:23.478
CONTINUE TO ADDRESSING ASSESS

01:21:23.545 --> 01:21:25.213
WHAT'S WORKED WHAT HASN'T. I'M

01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:26.681
CERTAINLY I KNOW THAT ON THE

01:21:26.748 --> 01:21:27.816
BANKING AND FINANCE SIDE

01:21:27.882 --> 01:21:28.750
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF

01:21:28.817 --> 01:21:30.619
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHETHER OR

01:21:30.685 --> 01:21:33.321
NOT- WE WILL NEED TO DO MORE

01:21:33.388 --> 01:21:35.123
FOR PROPERTY OWNERS HOMEOWNERS.

01:21:35.190 --> 01:21:36.958
AND LANDLORDS- ON THAT

01:21:37.025 --> 01:21:38.727
PARTICULAR SIDE SO I LOOK

01:21:38.793 --> 01:21:40.629
FORWARD TO THE CONTINUED THE

01:21:40.695 --> 01:21:41.429
CONVERSATIONS AND THANK ALL OF

01:21:41.496 --> 01:21:43.598
THOSE INVOLVED- BUT I DO WANT

01:21:43.665 --> 01:21:45.300
TO BE CLEAR THAT THE OPTIONS IN

01:21:45.367 --> 01:21:46.701
FRONT OF US ARE EITHER IN

01:21:46.768 --> 01:21:48.703
ACTION WHICH MEANS THERE IS.

01:21:48.770 --> 01:21:51.039
NOTHING WE WILL DO OR WE WILL

01:21:51.106 --> 01:21:52.641
HAVE THE ABILITY TO VOTE ON

01:21:52.707 --> 01:21:54.709
THIS BILL- AS THE ONLY OCT

01:21:54.776 --> 01:21:55.977
LEGISLATIVE OPTION AT THE

01:21:56.044 --> 01:21:58.513
MOMENT- THAT WILL STILL HELP

01:21:58.580 --> 01:21:59.948
SOME EVEN IF IT DOESN'T SOLVE

01:22:00.015 --> 01:22:03.618
EVERY SINGLE. CHALLENGE WE HAVE

01:22:03.685 --> 01:22:04.552

WITH THIS BILL. BECAUSE YOU

01:22:29.444 --> 01:22:33.782

AT THE SAME TIME I ALSO KNOW A

01:22:43.658 --> 01:22:48.129
LOT OF. US PROPERTY OWNERS WHO

01:22:48.196 --> 01:22:50.865

AND THEY STILL HAVE A MORTGAGE

01:22:51.533 --> 01:23:03.678
THAT THEY NEED TO CARRY. AND.

01:23:03.745 --> 01:23:08.717

CONSTRUCTIVE. I THINK WE ALL

01:24:05.673 --> 01:24:06.908

COMPLETE AND TOTAL LACK OF

LEADERSHIP CERTAINLY COMING

01:24:18.887 --> 01:24:19.754
FROM THE WHITE HOUSE AND OTHER

01:24:19.821 --> 01:24:21.723
PLCES IN WASHING DC. ARE WHY

01:24:21.790 --> 01:24:22.557
WE HAVE TO TAKE IT UPON

OURSELVES TO FIGURE OUT A

01:24:24.125 --> 01:24:26.027
REASONABLE SOLUTION OF WHICH
