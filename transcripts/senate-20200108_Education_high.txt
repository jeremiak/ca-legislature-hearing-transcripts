NOT HAVE A QUORUM SO WE WILL START AS A SUB COMMITTEE SENATOR UMBERG TAKEN AWAY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR SENATOR ALSO- BEFORE THE DAY IS SB FOUR FOUR FOUR- CONCERNING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN THE SUPERIOR COURTS- AS YOU KNOW ALL OF CALIFORNIA IN MANY WAYS IS IN THE FOREFRONT OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN IN ONE AREA THAT WE WISH TO EXPLORE IS EFFICIENCIES- IN THE JUSTICE SYSTEM BY USING THE RESOURCES. IN THIS CASE THAT DIVERSITY CALIFORNIA IRVINE AND YOU RECEIVE CALIFORNIA BERKELEY- TO COLLABORATE WITH THE COURTS TO CREATE A MORE EFFICIENT SYSTEM ANYMORE JUST SYSTEM IN PARTICULAR WITH RESPECT TO FOR EXAMPLE PRO SE LITIGANTS FOLKS WHO DON'T HAVE COUNSEL- BUT ARE ENGAGED IN IN THE JUSTICE SYSTEM. AS WELL AS JUDGE NOT TOMORROW IT WITH ME HERE TODAY IS THE PRESIDING JUDGE THE ORANGE COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT JUDGE NOT CAMARO WE WE'RE TALKING THIS MORNING ABOUT SOME OTHER AREAS WHERE WE MIGHT CREATE SOME GREAT EFFICIENCIES SO FOR EXAMPLE- WITH RESPECT TO EXPUNGEMENT OF RECORDS OF WHETHER WE CAN USE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TO AUTOMATICALLY EXPUNGE SOME RECORDS THAT ARE DESERVING OF EXPUNGEMENT. WITHOUT HAVING TO GO THROUGH THE LABORIOUS PROCESS OF ACTUALLY HAVING HEARING AND GOING THROUGH THAT EXERCISE THE SAME THING WITH RESTRAINING ORDERS THAT- IT IS POSSIBLE PERHAPS TO EXPEDITE AND TO CREATE EFFICIENT IS WITH RESPECT. TO OF RESEARCH IN ORDER. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE BUT THE RESIST WELL IS TO CALL THIS A COLLABORATIVE MAC. BETWEEN THE COURTS AND- AND TO SCHOOLS TO DO THAT A JUDGE NT KOMMER AS BEEN IN THE FOREFRONT A IN TERMS OF JUDGES. INTERESTED IN LEADING THIS EFFORT NEEDS WITH ME HERE TODAY TO TESTIFY ON BEHALF OF SB FOR. JUDGE THANK YOU SENATOR OF TWO WITNESSES TWO MINUTES EACH SO YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE AS YOU MAY HAVE ALL FOUR MINUTES. WELCOME THANK YOU HAVE THE CENTERS OF STAFF- HAPPY NEW YEAR- IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE- SENATE BILL FOUR FOUR FOUR. I AM THE BLOODY JUDGE AS INDICATED BY SENATOR UMBERG OF THE ORANGE COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT- WE ARE THE THIRD LARGEST COURT IN CALIFORNIA AND I BELIEVE WE ARE. PROBABLY THE AT THE MOST FOR FRONT OF THE A. I. TECHNOLOGY AND- OF THE STATE WE HAVE OVER A HUNDRED- PERSONNEL IN OUR TAX SECTION WHICH FAR EXCEEDS HIS BODY OF THE COURT AND PERHAPS EXCEPT FOR LOS ANGELES. AND WE JUST WERE PROVIDED OVER A MILLION DOLLARS IN GRANT MONEY TO PROVIDE FOR CERTAIN- TECHNOLOGY PROJECTS A CLEANER COURT USUAL PORTAL WHICH BASICALLY- ALLOWS. A PRO SE LITIGANTS TO SEE WHAT'S GOING ON AT THE COURT YOUR CALENDARS IN THE CASE. THAT AS WELL AS OTHER ITEMS IN TERMS OF JURY SERVICE WE HAVE- A NEW PROGRAM FOR PEOPLE TO LOOK AT THEIR APP AND SEE. SOMEONE TO A JURY THINGS OF THAT NATURE THESE ARE OF. REASONS WHY ARE IS AT THE FOREFRONT TECHNO. WE HAVE A- CORD ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE WE ARE LOOKING AT PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE GOOGLE AND SOME OTHER OF VERY MICROSOFT VERY VERY LARGE- COMPANIES THAT ARE- IN FACT AT THE FOREFRONT THE OFFICIAL DILIGENCE WE'VE TALKED WITH THE DEAN S W SCHOOL WHO WISHES TO HAVE UC IRVINE AT THE FOREFRONT OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN TERMS OF LAW SCHOOL EDUCATION. SO WELL WE'VE ALREADY TALKED WITH THE- A JOE DONE WHOSE ALSO ON THE- OF THE BOARD OF VISITORS FOR YOU SEE I LAW SCHOOL IN THE WE HAVE ALREADY HAD ONE COURSE IN CONJUNCTION WITH YOU SO I LAW SCHOOL AND THEIR STUDENTS. IN WHICH WE WERE. DEVELOPING A PROGRAM WHICH WILL ASSIST PRO SE LITIGANTS IN MAKING AS A CENTER NUMBER INDICATED- PROTECTIVE OR APPLICATIONS. WE THINK WE CAN GO MUCH FURTHER- WITH RESPECT TO EXPAND ONE ORDERS WE GET EXPIRED THOSE WITH ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE- WITH RESPECT TO FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN MEANING THE- ABROGATION OF THE FELONY MURDER RULE. WE BELIEVE THAT WE CAN IMPLEMENT THE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN TERMS OF- PROCESSING THOSE APPLICATIONS MUCH QUICKER AND THEN IT WOULD TAKE BOTH OF LOS. LAW CLERKS AS WELL AS- JUDGES TO PROCESS OVER TIME AND- IF YOU THE FACT THAT THE FOURTH DISTRICT HAS. RECENTLY HELD THAT- FORTY THREE SEVEN IS NOT ON CONSTITUTION BASED ON CERTAIN PROPOSITIONS THAT WERE ARGUABLY INCONSISTENT WITH THAT. IT APPEARS THAT IT'S GOING TO BE A HUGE TASK FOR THE COURT TO PROCEED IN THAT FASHION LET ME SAY THAT ACCESS TO THE COURT IS. PROBABLY ONE OF THE HIGHEST PRIORITIES OF OUR COURT INDIVIDUALLY TERMS OF ONE COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT WE HAD A- A- CONFERENCE OF ALL ALL BENCH CONFERENCE IN MARCH WE IDENTIFY THAT AS OUR MAJOR GOAL. THE CHIEF JUSTICE CAN'T HEAL SAKE WAY HAS INDICATED THAT ONE OF HER HIGHS PARTIES WELL AS USUAL COUNCIL SO. WITH RESPECT TO USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE WHICH IS A VERY POWERFUL TOOLAND BRING IN THE COURSE INTO- THE FOREFRONT OF THIS TECHNOLOGY. IT WOULD BE OF GREAT BENEFIT WHEN WE WOULD SHARE THAT BENEFIT WITH THE OTHER COURTS WHAT WE HAVE ALSO DONE PREVIOUSLY WHEN WE'VE- DEVELOP CERTAIN PROJECTS THAT WOULD- BE BENEFICIAL. TO THAT THE COURT SYSTEM. SOUNDS GREAT THANK YOU JUDGE. ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. YES OKAY IS THERE ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. ALL RIGHT SEEING NONE WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS CONCERNS. YES SENATOR RAZA THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR AND THE JUDGE ALSO FOR IF OU COULD GET IN A LITTLE BIT MORE SINCE I'M- NOT THE KIND OF PERSON WHO UNDERSTANDS EVERYTHING ABOUT. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE BUT IF YOU COULD EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT BETTER HOW THIS WOULD HELP PEOPLE I KNOW YOU GAVE EXAMPLES OF EXPUNGEMENT OF RECORDS AND RESTRAINING ORDERS MAYBE JURY SERVICE. BUT IF YOU'RE A REGULAR. PERSON ON THE STREET WHAT HOW HOW DO YOU DO THIS AND WHAT KIND OF TRAINING WOULD IT TAKE TO DO THIS WE'RE GONNA BE USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE DOES NOT REQUIRE ANOTHER LEVEL OF UNDERSTANDING DOES REQUIRE ANOTHER LEVEL OF TRAINING TO BUILD TO USE THAT. WHO ARE THE FOLKS WHO WOULD BE ABLE TO BENEFIT THE MOST AND YOU KNOW MAYBE YOU HAVE REAL STUDIES ON THIS MAYBE OF JUST PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE BUT- GET INTO THAT A LITTLE BIT MORE FOR ME PLEASE. I'LL TAKE A CRACK IN THE JUDGE NOT AMERICAN CORRECT ME- SO. I THINK FOR EXAMPLE WITH RESPECT TO PRO SE. LITIGANTS WHO ARE FACING OF SITUATION DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SO. OFTEN TIMES NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL AND THE THEY THEY HAVE TO FILL OUT A FORM AND THEN DEMONSTRATE THAT. THEY'VE HIT THE REQUISITE SORT OF. BOB REQUISITE LEVEL OF EVIDENCE THAT KIND OF THING AND SO IT HELPS BOTH THE APPLICANT. SAYS THE APPLICANT YOU DID NOT YOU DON'T TELL US FOR EXAMPLE WHEN AND WHERE YEAH AND DID EVENT INVOLVING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE OCCURRED SO WE NEED TO KNOW WHEN AND WHERE AND WHO. IF YOUR FORM DOESN'T HAVE THAT IT IT IT SPITS IT BACK OUT AT YOU AND THEN ON THE OTHER SIDE IT IS THE BENCH OFFICER THEN WOULD SEE THE APPLICATION AND IT CAN ALERT THE BENCH OFFICER ALL WERE MISSING THIS OR WE HAVE THIS OR THIS IS YOU CAN'T CONSIDER THIS YOU KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S BEYOND. WHAT WHAT YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO CONSIDER YOU KNOW SAY FOR EXAMPLE IT LIST SOMEONE SAYS THEY'VE DONE SOMETHING AND THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT RACE OR SOMETHING THERE YOU CAN'T CONSIDER THAT SO OF THAT THAT'S THAT'S MY VIEW JUDGE YOU GO YES- WE WOULD HOPEFULLY HAVE THIS. A I PROGRAM SO THAT WHEN IT REACHES THE JUDGE THERE'S NO OBVIOUS DEFECTS AN APPLICATION LET'S SAY THAT SOMEBODY COMES INTO A SELF HELP CENTER AND THERE'S SOME TYPE OF AFTER MANY TIMES OUR SELF HELP CENTERS ARE OVERWHELMED WITH. PEOPLE COMING IN REPRESENTING THEMSELVES AND THEY NEED IMMEDIATE HELP THEY COULD SIT DOWN AS AT A COMPUTER MIGHT HAVE AN AVATAR SOMEBODY BASICALLY LOOKS LIKE A PERSON BUT ACTUALLY IS IN A AYE PERSON. LIAM THROUGH THE APPLICATION PROCESS IS SO WHEN THEY PUT IN THE FIRST OR SECOND LINE OF THAT APPLICATION EXT WILL YOU MISS THIS WITH RESPECT TO THE PERSON WHO'S BASICALLY DOING THIS TO YOU YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THE BURDEN OF PROOF IS ACTS. I AM THE ARE YOU STILL WANT TO GO FORWARD WITH THIS SO THEY UNDERSTAND. IN THE APPLICATION IS X. Y. Z. WHAT TIMES THE- SELF HELP CENTER PERSON DON'T HAVE THE TIME TO EXPLAIN IT TO THEM. AND DOESN'T. BASICALLY GO THROUGH EVERY ELEMENT OF WHAT THEY NEED TO HAVE IN THEIR APPLICATION AND GOES LINE BY LINE IN TERMS OUR APPLICATION. AND BY THE TIME THAT IT'S COMPLETED. NOT ONLY DOES THE APPLICANT FEEL PRETTY CONFIDENT THAT THAT APPLICATIONS GOING TO BE SUFFICIENT FOR A JUDGE TO GRANT A PROTECTIVE ORDER WITH RESPECT LESZEK VIOLENCE. BUT ALSO THE JUDGE WILL FEEL THE SAME WAY AND- THE APPLICANT FEELS THAT- THEY THEY HAVE MET THE BURDEN OF PROOF. TO GET A PROTECTIVE ORDER WHICH PREVENTS THEM FROM BEING. A VICTIM OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. THE WHAT SOMETIMES IT DOES NOT IN THEIR LOWER TO PRACTICE BUT I HAVE OBSERVED IS THAT AN APPLICANT WILL HAVE AN INSUFFICIENT APPLICATION THE COURT THE BENCH ALSO LOOK AT AND SAY I'M SORRY THIS APPLICATION IS INSUFFICIENT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO COME BACK WELL THAT THAT DOESN'T WORK WELL FOR THE COURTS OR FOR THE FOR THE APPLICANT- WITH RESPECT TO EXPUNGEMENT THERE THERE ARE CERTAIN. OUR RECORDS THAT ARE ENTITLED TO EXPUNGEMENT BUT IF THE PERSON WHO- DOESN'T KNOW THAT THAT THERE AND HAVE THE EXPUNGEMENT- THEORETICALLY A I WILL IDENTIFY YOU KNOW THESE OF THE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE THAT NOW CAN HAVE THE RECORDS EXPUNGED FOR CERTAIN OFFENSES. WELL. AND IT HELP YET JUST I'M SORRY. IS THIS THE VERY FIRST TIME THE IT'S GOING TO BE DONE ANYWHERE IN A CORD OR IS THERE SOME VERSION THAT'S ALREADY BEEN TRIED- WHERE WHERE DO WE STAND AS FAR AS. I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY- A. R. PROGRAM WITH RESPECT TO. PROTECTIVE ORDERS I KNOW I KNOW THAT WE'VE ALREADY STARTED WORKING ON THIS LIST TO THE UC IRVINE LAW STUDENTS AND BASICALLY- GENERATING THIS TYPE OF PROGRAM. WITH RESPECT TO UP THE EXPUNGEMENT ORDERS AGAIN- WE ARE AT THE FOREFRONT OF THIS THESE ARE PROGRAMS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN ALREADY GENERATED THESE ARE. VERY WOULD BE VERY SOPHISTICATED WITH RESPECT TO OF WHAT WE WOULD HAVE TO LOOK AT TWO WOULD MAKE SURE THAT THIS PERSON TO TILE TO EXPUNGE WHEN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE POINT. SO ON. THIS IS WHY. WE NEED THE FUNDING WHO- THE COURTS ARE OPERATING AT A SITUATION WHERE WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS OF. TAX STAFF TO TAKE CONSERVE CERTAIN PROJECTS SUCH AS THIS- WE CERTAINLY HAVE THE EXPERTISE TO DO IT. IT'S JUST HAVING THE FUNDING AND THE PERSON POWER TO ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT IT. THANK YOU I'M A REP FOR JUST A SECOND- WE HAVE A QUORUM MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL LEYVA HERE FLAVOR HERE WILK CHIANG RUSSELL. RUSSELL HERE GLAZER. GLAZER HERE MCGUIRE PAN. PAN HERE. THANK YOU. ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS HEARD RIGHT NOW I JUST TO COMMENT THAT- I MEAN THIS THE CONCEPT OF IT OBVIOUSLY SOUNDS REALLY GREAT- A LOT MORE QUESTIONS AND WE'LL JUST KEEP TALKING ABOUT IT. MARCUS AND- IT IT JUST A LOT OF QUESTIONS. BUT POSITIVE QUESTION. THANK YOU SENATOR THEY'RE PAN I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND- SIR BURGER APPRECIATE YOU BRING THIS BILL- FRONT OF US A DO YOU HAVE I DO A SO HAVE MANY SEVERAL QUESTIONS SENATOR ALSO I IT'S BECAUSE THE FIRST QUESTION IS BY MOST PERTINENT TO ADD COMMITTEE IS THAT. IT'S USUALLY FAIRLY UNUSUAL FOR US TO. AT THE END SENSE TO ITS FOR TWO MILLION DOLLARS RIGHT TO ALLOCATE MONEY DIRECTLY TO A SUB PART OF YOU SEE AND NOT YOU SEE AS A WHOLE SO- IS IT IS THERE'S SO OBVIOUSLY THESE ARE LAW SCHOOL SO THEY HAVE LEGAL EXPERTISE- IS THAT WHERE THE MONEY'S GOING TO SPUR THE LAW SCHOOL AND WHY THESE LAW SCHOOLS IS THERE SOME SERVICE CAPACITY THAT THEY HAVE BEYOND THEIR LEGAL EXPERTISE- IN TERMS OF IN TECHNICAL. CAPACITY THAT- THOSE PARTICULAR LAW SCHOOLS VERSUS HAVING YOU KNOW BASICALLY CHARGING YOU SEE TO DO THIS ARE WE PLAINTIFFS ARE THESE LAW SCHOOLS ON CONTRACTORS OUT TO A TECH COMPANY A SO HOW HOW HOW'S THIS POST THE- VISION TO WORK SO THANK YOU CENTER PAN FOR THOSE QUESTIONS- QUESTION NUMBER ONE THE MONEY QUESTION YOU'RE RIGHT WE CAN'T THIS BE AMENDED WE CAN'T WE APPROPRIATE MONEY THE RECEIPT CALIFORNIA AND AS YOU KNOW THEY ARE SEPARATE SOVEREIGN NATION- AND THAT THAT THEY DECIDE HOW MONEY IS TO BE SPENT SO THIS. WHAT WE'RE NOT THE BILL. DIRECT THIS. ARM WE ARE HOPEFUL AND WORKING WITH THE RIVER. THIS HAPPENS THIS IS A COLLABORATIVE INITIATIVE THAT I THINK IS A GREAT DEAL OF MERIT. AND I'M HOPEFUL AND I. HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE THEY'LL SEE THE MERIT IN THIS THIS PROPOSAL AS NUMBER ONE. NUMBER TWO IN TERMS OF THE TO LAW SCHOOLS- THERE IS A CALIFORNIA IRVINE IS JUDGE NOT KOMMER INDICATOR THERE'S BEEN VAULT IN THIS AREA FOR SOMETIME AND IN THEIR SEEKING. THE DEAN IN PARTICULAR DâN SONG IS. SEEKING TO BE- IN THE FOREFRONT AMONG ALL LAW SCHOOLS IN THE COUNTRY. IN THE AREA OF A AYE IN THE JUSTICE SYSTEM AND SO IT WAS REALLY AT THEIR INITIATIVE THAT THAT THIS BEGAN- NEVER SEE CALIFORNIA BERKELEY DEAN CHAMBER IN SKI NEVER TO LAG BEHIND ANY OTHER SCHOOL OF THE HIS CHIMED IN AND SAID HE- HE WANTS TO PARTICIPATE AS WELL. THE RATIONALE IS THAT IF YOU THERE'S FIVE YEARS UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA LAW SCHOOLS. IF WE'RE SPREAD TOO THIN- THEN WE WON'T REALLY BE ABLE TO FOCUS EFFORTS AND SO THAT THAT'S THE RATIONALE BUT IS THERE SOME SORT TECHNICAL EXPERTISE TO THE ANY GET I DON'T. THAT SPREAD EVENLY MODEL IT DOES NOT GRAMMAR RESPONDED BUT I BUT I THINK THE AT THE SHORT ANSWER IS. THAT THEY DO HAVE CERTAIN LEGALLY THIESSEN SOME TECHNO THEY THEY HAVE TECHNICAL. FOLKS ON FACULTY AT UCI THAT THAT ARE INSTRUMENTAL IN IMPLEMENTING YES JUDGE AT THE CENTER AND THANKS FOR THE QUESTION. I'M NOT SURE IF YOU'RE HERE FOR I EXPLAINED IN TERMS OF WAR TENNIS ARTICLE WORK. YES BUT WE ARE AT THE FOREFRONT OF TECHNOLOGY AND THE COURT YSTEM WE HAVE OVER A HUNDRED. PERSONNEL WITH RECESS SO I THOUGHT MAYBE JUST AS OUR CUT TO THE CHASE THEN OKAY THE- TECHNICAL EXPERTISE WOULD BE THROUGH THE- COURTS AND ORANGE COUNTY ARE WITH B. B. CONTRACTING OUT WELL. LOU BECAUSE IT SAY I RIGHT YEAH I HAVEN'T FINISHED IT BUT I'M NOT. WITH RESPECT TO YOU WE HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH GOOGLE WELL. AS A MICROSOFT. THOSE HUGE RELATIONSHIP SO WE HAVE ALREADY EXISTING. THAT WE CAN TAP INTO THAT WE'VE ALREADY HAVE A RELATIONSHIP AND ALSO THEY COULD. PROVIDE US WITH SOME EXPERTISE THAT WE NEEDED. IN ADDITION WITH RESPECT TO UC IRVINE LOS AUTORES SPEAK TO BECAUSE I'M ON THE BOARD OF VISITORS. OF THE WE HAVE A JOE DON WHO IS BASICALLY A IN A TRACTOR WITH RESPECT TO. IT OUR FREEWILL TELLIGENT IS ALSO. A PROFESSIONAL STAFF IS NAME ESCAPES ME. BUT THE ON AT UC IRVINE LAW SCHOOL WHO IS IT AN EXPERT IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE HE WAS PART OF THE FOR ME. REGULATION OF THE WATSON PROGRAM IF YOU SAW THAT. YEAH ELLE BASICALLY- FOR IBM SO- THERE IS CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF EXPERTISE I THINK THAT WITH RESPECT OR CHORDS WELL AS THE LOSS OKAY ALL RIGHT. AND THEN- BUT YOUR INTELLIGENCE BUT I DON'T SON TO DO STRAIGHT I'M NOT ATTORNEY BUT IT SINCE WE'RE TALKING A AYE AND I HAVE SOME EXPERIENCE OR KNOWLEDGE ABOUT A AYE AND HEALTH CARE. AND SO IT SOUNDS SEXY WILL AND DO A I TO HELP US SORT OUT THESE THINGS. A YET SO FIRST OF ALL THE TIME BUT PLEASE SEE HERE JUDGE BECAUSE IT BECAUSE OF MY OF MY QUESTIONS WAS IS THAT WHILE IS DID YOU DO CHAU COUNCIL ALL ON BOARD BECAUSE YOU CREATE A TOLL. AND YOU KNOW OUR THE JUDGE IS GOING TO USE IT RIGHT ALREADY HAS A I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON IN THAT BLACK BOX OKAY SO I GUESS IS A COUPLE QUESTIONS RELATED AYE ONE IS THE BLACK BOX ASPECT. IF YOU'RE ACTUALLY USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE BECAUSE THAT'S A QUESTION LIKE- YOU KNOW YOU YOU DO THE NEURAL NETWORKS WHATEVER ELSE BUT EXACTLY WHAT IS GOING ON INSIDE RIGHT IN FACT SOME STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT WHEN YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON INSIDE ESSENTIALLY YOUR AND BEDDING AND THIS IS PERHAPS IMPOSE RELEVANT TO THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM. IT'S ALREADY BEEN A PROBLEM HEALTHCARE SYSTEM WHERE YOU ACTUALLY IN BED CERTAIN BIASES AND SO FORTH BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAY WE'VE ALWAYS DONE THINGS YES YOU BAKE IT INTO THE PROGRAM. OKAY SO. THAT DOESN'T MEAN THIS PROJECT WON'T WORK BUT AGAIN SOMETHING TO BE VERY AWARE ABOUT THAT. IT NEEDS TO BE ESPECIALLY I THINK IT IS A PROCESS. WHATEVER PROCESS THIS. PROGRAM IS A AYE PROGRAMS GOING TO BE. NEED T BE VERY TRANSPARENT WHAT'S GOING ON YOU'LL GET INPUT OUTPUT WHAT'S GOING ON IN BETWEEN. IS THE- WELL THERE'S A NEURAL NETWORK AND ITS LIKE THAT AT ABOUT SEVEN IN AND OUT YOU HAVE TO BEFORE YOU USE IT SAY. I HAVE TO UNDERSTAND EXACTLY HOW THIS PROGRAM IS MAKING DECISION. THAT I PUT THIS INPUT IN. LEADING TO THAT RECOMMENDATION. BECAUSE IT IS IT IS YOU MENTIONED A JUDGE OR SOMEONE'S GONNA BE. EXPECTING TO MAKE DECISIONS BASED. RECOMMENDATION AND WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON IN THAT BLACK BOX IN BETWEEN. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT RECOMMENDATIONS COMING OUT WELL IT'S THE A. I. PROGRAM. SHE JUST YOU KNOW PROBABLY DOING SOMETHING RIGHT. THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE RATE. TO RESPOND TO QUESTIONS AN EVENT- WE ACTUALLY DID HAVE WE'VE MET SEVERAL TIMES WE HAD A HEARING IN ORANGE COUNTY WITH THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND YOU YOU'VE IDENTIFIED ONE OF THE KEY CONCERNS IS. IMPLICIT BIAS- AND HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO OUR BEST TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T HAVE IMPLICIT BIAS ONE OF THE SAFEGUARDS THOUGH IS THAT. SO JUST USING THE EXAMPLE OF A PROTECTIVE ORDER RESTRAINING ORDER IS THAT ULTIMATELY A BENCH OFFICER HAS TO MAKE THAT DECISION SO IN OTHER WORDS THE THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE A BLACK BOX THAT MAKES A DECISION. I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT WHATEVER POPS OUT IN TERMS OF JUDGE YOU NEED TO YOU KNOW LOOK AT THE FOLLOWING ARE YOU SERIOUS ARE WE ARE WE MISSING THIS CRITERIA- THAT THAT THAT THAT'S A THAT'S AN IMPORTANT CONCERN. THAT THAT WE ARE VERY MUCH AWARE OF- WE SHOULDN'T. IN MY VIEW THOUGH. OF A PARTICULAR WITH RESPECT TO PRO SE LITIGANTS. OF WHO. WE SHOULDN'T LOVE. WE SHOULD DELAY THINGS BE BECAUSE THE PRO SE LITIGANTS RIGHT NOW ARE BEING IMPACTED BY THE IN FISH IN MY VIEW THE IN INEFFICIENCIES OF THE CURRENT SYSTEM SO I THINK WE CAN OVERCOME. ANY ISSUE CONCERNING IMPLICIT BIAS BOTH IN TERMS OF THE MECHANISM BUT ALSO IN TERMS THE SAFEGUARDS OKAY WELL SICKER YEAH IS THAT I'M HEARING RIGHT DOCUMENT FOR IS OF COURSE WE HAVE THIS PRESSURE. ON THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM- OF COURSE JUSTICE DELAYED IS OFTEN JUSTICE DENIED HOW DO WE MOVE THINGS ALONG WE CREATE A PROGRAM THAT'S GOING TO HELP DO THIS. BUT ESPECIALLY IN THE PRESSURE OF TIME. THE PROGRAM MAKES A RECOMMENDATION THE JUDGE SAYS OKAY THAT'S RECOMMENDATION I'M SURE WILL STILL CONSIDER OTHER FACTORS BUT IN THE PRESSURE OF TIME MAY SAY OKAY LET'S JUST SWEEP THROUGH THESE YOU KNOW OF A PROGRAM THAT SCANNED THROUGH THE PROGRAM AT SOMETHING BUILT IN AND WE DON'T KNOW IT THAT'S MY THING IS WE NEED TO HAVE THE NEEDS TO BE TRANSPARENT HOW IT GOT FROM POINT A OF. A TO POINT B. AND THAT'S WHEN THE CHALLENGES AN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE BECAUSE THE MECHANISM THE REASONS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IS BECAUSE THE OTHER SOME INTERNAL PROCESS BUT IT'S NOT ALWAYS TRANSPARENT HOW IT GETS FROM THIS INPUT SAID INPUTS LEAD TO THOSE SET OF OUTLETS AND THAT. BOX AND ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE COMPANIES THAT MIGHT ONE MAKING PROPRIETARY YET SAY NO NO NO NO NO IT HAS TO BE BLOWN OPEN HAS TO BE OPENED TO EXAMINATION BY PEOPLE TO BE SURE THAT OTHER OUTSIDE OTHER ENTITIES CAN LOOK AT IT AND SAY WELL YOU KNOW WHAT ACTUALLY THERE MAY BE A PROBLEM HERE AND WE NEED TO FIND A WAY TO ADJUST FOR THAT RIGHT. SO IT CAN'T BE PROPRIETARY HAS TO BE OPEN ENDED SB TRANSPARENT PEOPLE NEED TO BUILD BASICALLY WORK. DIVE INTO AND FIGURE OUT WHAT EXACTLY IS THAT PROGRAM DOING- AND I CAN GIVE YOU I WON'T SPEND TIME HERE DOING EXAMPLES IN HEALTH CARE WHERE THINGS HAVE YOU KNOW ACTUALLY THE WHEN THEY FINALLY BROKE UP IN THE BOX MADE DECISIONS REALLY BASED ON THINGS THAT WERE NOT APPROPRIATE- AND THEN I GUESS FINALLY I WOULDJUST MAKE A THIS IS JUST A FROM MY EXPERIENCE COMMENT AGAIN PRIVATE MORE. PREVENTION APPROPRIATE DID YOU SURE IT I APPRECIATE DID YOU KNOW IS USING PROGRAM TO MAKE SOME OF THESE HAVE THINGS HAPPEN I ALSO KNOW TALKING TO SOME NO NOT THE LEGAL STAFF LIKE LOCKERS AND THE JUDGES BUT FRONTLINE STAFF IN A CERTAIN COURT SYSTEMS THAT BASE SOME BEEN TOLD THEY CAN'T TELL CLIENTS ARE HEALTH PLANS THANKS HEY YOU KNOW YOU FORGOT THEY- ARE. ALSO THE CAN ONLY ACCEPT A FORM SO I HOPE THAT DID YOU FEEL COUNSEL ALSO LOOKING AT FREEING YOUR FRONT LINE STAFF TO ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO ASSIST PEOPLE NOT WITH LEGAL ADVICE AT. IT PEOPLE HAVE. STE PHIL AND- SPACE FORMER PUMPING ACTUALLY Là POINT IT OUT TO PEOPLE. AND NOT BE PUNISHED FOR THAT BECAUSE I'M FOR I HAVE THAT FROM PEOPLE. FROM FRONT MIGHT STAFF THAT THEY'VE BEEN TOLD THAT THAT'S COOL THE PRACTICE OF LAW TO POINT OUT THIS FOOT SOMEONE FORGOT TO DATE THE FORM. THEY JUST HAVE TO ACCEPT IT AND THEY GET A LETTER SAYING HEY YOU DIDN'T EAT YOUR FORMER REJECTING A REFILE IT. AND HOPEFULLY SO THAT'S ASIDE ROM A AYE BUT THAT'S YOU KNOW WE NEED TO BE SURE THAT THOSE TYPES AND EFFICIENCIES ARE LIMITED AS WENT. AND THAT WHAT WE DISCUSSED EARLIER OF THAT THAT IS A COMMON ISSUE IS WHERE SOMEONE FEELS AN APPLICATION AND- PRESUMABLY. THIS IS NOT QUITE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE THIS IS WHERE WHEE YOU DIDN'T PUT IN THE DATE AND RIGHT PROGRAM SAYS OH YOU CAN'T SUBMIT THIS BECAUSE IN PUT A DATE RATHER. THAN APPEARING BEFORE THE BENCH OFF THEIR BENCH OFFICES OGLE GOODNESS GRACIOUS. I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH DETAIL HERE ABOUT WHATEVER EVENT. IS NOT PRECIPITATED YOU COMING TO COURT ASKING FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER. YOU COME BACK TOMORROW OKAY THE THAT. THAT IF WE CAN CREATE EFFICIENCY WHERE THE FORM ACTUALLY SAYS YOU YOU KNOW YOU HAVEN'T MET THE BURDEN OF PROOF YOU NEED MORE INFORMATION. A JUDGE. YES I CERVANTES IDENTIFY PROBABLY THE MOST. A CRUCIAL CONCERN WITH RESPECT TO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE WITH RESPECT TO BIAS IT'S GOING TO SHOW THE BIASES THE PERSON ACTUALLY PROGRAM THE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE SITUATION- WITH RESPECT TO- JUDICIAL DECISIONS IT'S AGAINST THE- USUAL ETHICS TO WERE. BASICALLY WHAT A COMPUTER MAKE THAT DECISION YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE UNDERLYING FACTS IN ORDER TO MAKE THAT DECISION A WITH RESPECT TO MANY OF WHAT JUDGES DO AND I'M NOT SURE IF YOU'RE AWARE OF THIS MANY OF ITS TO IS BASED ON. WORK UP DONE BY LEGAL RESEARCH PEOPLE ALL OF THE CLERICAL AND- SOMETIMES THE COPIES OF THOSE STAFF AND VERY STRONG MENTALLY THEY HAVE THEIR OWN BIASES AND I THINK WITH RESPECT TO A DECISIONS AND WHAT THEY FEEL IS IMPORTANT TO BRING THAT TO THE JUDGE. MAY BE MORE OF. OTHER CONSERVE THAN USING A AYE WITH RESPECT TO- HAVE A GROUP OF JUDGES SAYING WE NEED TO LOOK AT ALL THESE THINGS IN ORDER TO HAVE A COMPLETE WORK UP TO GIVE TO THE JUDGE BECAUSE THAT PERSON MAY HAVE HAD A BAD DAY AND HAD SOMETHING WITH RESPECT TO A PERSON OF CERTAIN TYPE OF- RACIAL BACKGROUND WHEN THEY SEE THAT PERSONS OF THE APPLICATION. OF THEY MIGHT SAY WELL GOSH I'M NOT GOING TO REALLY GIVE THIS OF THE A DEGREE OF IMPORTANCE THAT IT DOES WELL WE GET IN A AYE SITUATION OF THAT TYPE OF BIAS THAT MIGHT COME INTO THAT TYPE OF DECISION MAKING IS NOT THERE SO WE ARE TALKING ABOUT REPLACING A- PERSON WHO MIGHT HAVE THEIR OWN BIASES WITH A COMPUTER. SYSTEM THAT. PERHAPS WHAT IS SUPERIOR BECAUSE IT. BASICALLY LOOKS AT MORE FACTORS IT'S NOT A SUBJECT TO THE WITH THE MOTION OF A PERSON WHO THE JUDGES OBVIOUSLY SOMETIMES WILL RELY UPON. AND THE BUT I THINK WITH RESPECT TO BE MORE COMPREHENSIVE AND LOOKING AT ALL THE FACTORS IF WE HAVE THE PROPER PROGRAM AND WE ARE AWARE AND OF BECOME VERY AWARE OF THE FACT THAT THERE COULD BE BIASES PLACED AND I THINK THAT MIGHT BE A SUPERIOR SIT SITUATION IN ORDER TO MAKE A DECISION OKAY WELL I APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATION OF IT AGAIN I THINK MY CONCERN WAS I UNDERSTAND THAT CERTAINLY YOU KNOW HAVING A PERSON COULD HAVE THEIR OWN BIASES. THAT'S MY EMPHASIS WAS ON TRANSPARENCY ESPECIALLY USING A AYE SO BEING BE OF THE KNOW HOW YOU GOT FROM INPUT TWO OUTPUT RIGHT IS THE THING THAT I'M CALLING FOR NOT SAYING THAT WE CAN'T USE A AYE BUT I'M JUST SAYING THAT TOO OFTEN A I IT IS A BLACK BOX IN BETWEEN AND OR FOR VARIOUS REASONS SOMETIMES. THING IS PROPRIETARY SOMETHING ELSE AND WE'RE GONNA USE INDEED USUAL SYSTEM IT NEEDS TO BE TRANSPARENT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO TRACE HOW. THESE INPUTS LED TO THAT OUTPUT SO CAN UNDERSTAND AND THEN MAKE THE ADJUSTMENT TO THE PROGRAM. THE TRY TO REMOVE THE BIAS OF THEIR WE IN THAT A FIGHT WITH THANK YOU. YES THE AS I THINK. SET TRANSPARENCY IS IMPORTANT. AND I THINK BY HAVING A AYE PROGRAM YOU CAN'T BE MORE TRANSPARENT. BECAUSE I THINK JUDGES WOULD BE VERY HESITANT TO. TO DISCLOSE WHO THEY RELIED UPON WITH RESPECT TO A LOCK WORKS OR A LEGAL RESEARCH OPINION. LESS THAN THEY WERE ABLE THAT THE COURT WOULD BE ABLE TO PROVIDE A THIS IS OUR A OUR PROGRAM THIS IS WHAT WE DO IN ORDER TO MAKE A DECISION. VERY GOOD ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE ALL RIGHT. YES PLEASE JUST. IN TERMS OF HOW WHAT THIS MEANS SO. IT'S REQUESTING THAT. THE UC. SYSTEM HOUSE RESOLUTION. TO MOVE FORWARD ON THIS BUT THEN WERE COMMITTING TO IS. TWO MILLION DOLLARS. WELL GO FROM THE GENERAL FUND THAT THE MONEY THE MONEY PART BECAUSE WE CAN'T AS I MENTIONED WE CAN'T DIRECT THE SOVEREIGN STATE OF THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA TO SPEND THIS MONEY IN THIS PARTICULAR AREA THIS IS THE EXPRESSION ONE OF OUR INTENT- INTO WE BOTH INTENT IN TERMS OF THE- OF STRUCTURE AND INTENT IN TERMS OF WHERE WE HOPE THEY SPEND THE MONEY AND WE'LL WORK WITH THEM TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN.
