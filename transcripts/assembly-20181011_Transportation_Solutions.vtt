IN ICE WE WHEN YOU

MENTION IT IS TO BE ABLE

00:24:33.038 --> 00:24:34.472
PEOPLE TAKE THIS VERY

00:24:34.539 --> 00:24:37.409
LIGHTLY FIRST OF ALL A

00:24:38.109 --> 00:24:39.477
I SHOULD HAVE SAID IT IS IN

00:24:39.544 --> 00:24:41.079
THE BEGINNING OF MY PRESIDENCY

00:24:41.146 --> 00:24:42.547
THE PRESIDENT OF CCAC I

00:24:44.149 --> 00:24:46.117

I'M SPEAKING TO YOU ABOUT THE

00:24:50.288 --> 00:24:51.957
ONE I'M SPEAKING BECAUSE ALMOST

00:24:52.023 --> 00:24:54.793
SURPRISED BY THIS GUIDE TO SAY

00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:56.394
THAT WE SUPPORTED THIS BEFORE

00:24:57.896 --> 00:25:00.365
WE ARE DEFINITELY AGAINST

00:25:00.432 --> 00:25:01.700
THE REPEAL OF HISTORY ONE

00:25:02.701 --> 00:25:03.835
I KNOW SOME OF YOU MIGHT FEEL

00:25:03.902 --> 00:25:06.571
DIFFERENTLY BUT BUT I

00:25:06.638 --> 00:25:08.607
BELIEVE IF WE DO CALL IS IS ONE

00:25:08.673 --> 00:25:09.941
THIS WOULD BE ONE OF THE BIGGEST

00:25:10.008 --> 00:25:11.743
MISTAKES CALIFORNIANS MAKE

00:25:13.712 --> 00:25:15.380
IT'S NOT JUST A FIVE POINT FOUR

00:25:15.447 --> 00:25:16.648
MILLION DOLLARS THAT'S JUST

00:25:16.715 --> 00:25:17.816
GONNA BRING IT WILL FIX THE

00:25:17.883 --> 00:25:19.584
HOW IS IT IS THE IMPORTANCE OF

00:25:19.651 --> 00:25:21.286
THE HIGHWAY SYSTEM THEM TO OUR

00:25:21.353 --> 00:25:24.289
ECONOMY IT IS IS ESPECIALLY

00:25:24.356 --> 00:25:25.690
FOR AREAS LIKE MAN AND

00:25:26.992 --> 00:25:28.393
WE NEED MORE OR LESS MOST MOST

00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:31.196
LESS WE HAVE

00:25:31.263 --> 00:25:33.131
TWENTY THREE HUNDRED BRIDGES AND

00:25:33.198 --> 00:25:34.432
STALKING CALIFORNIA THAT'S HOW

00:25:34.499 --> 00:25:36.568
TO CLASSIFY EFFICIENT SERVICES

00:25:36.635 --> 00:25:37.669
FUNCTIONING DEFICIENT ARE

00:25:37.736 --> 00:25:40.205
OBSOLETE AND IF WE DON'T

00:25:40.272 --> 00:25:42.607
FIX THOSE THOSE GOD FOR BID

00:25:42.674 --> 00:25:45.076
BID IT BECOMES A PROBLEM

00:25:46.378 --> 00:25:48.179
SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THIS BE

00:25:48.246 --> 00:25:49.648
ONE WE HAVE BEEN GETTING BACK

00:25:49.714 --> 00:25:50.849
OUT OF THE FACT THAT THIS IS

00:25:50.916 --> 00:25:52.617
ABOUT AND INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S

00:25:52.684 --> 00:25:54.819
SO IMPORTANT TO THE ECONOMY IT'S

00:25:54.886 --> 00:25:57.188
ABOUT JOBS JOBS -- I AM

00:25:57.255 --> 00:25:59.224
VERY HOPEFUL THAT CALIFORNIANS

00:25:59.291 --> 00:26:01.893
WILL BE CHECKED IF YOU CALL OUR

00:26:02.894 --> 00:26:05.030
WE HAD CAG I DON'T LOB LOBBY

00:26:05.497 --> 00:26:06.698
WE CANNOT LOBBY LOBBY BUT

00:26:06.765 --> 00:26:09.034

YOU GETTING A LOT LIVE AROUND

00:26:10.902 --> 00:26:12.537
THE STATE FALLING APART

00:26:13.438 --> 00:26:15.040
SP ONE AND ITS CONTINUATION

00:26:15.106 --> 00:26:16.508
AND WE JUST TALK ABOUT THE PLAN

00:26:17.442 --> 00:26:19.010
THE PLAN CANNOT BE FULLY FUNDED

00:26:19.077 --> 00:26:21.246
IF WE DON'T HAVE ISSUES IF

00:26:21.313 --> 00:26:22.914
YOU TAKE FIVE POINT POINT FIVE

00:26:22.981 --> 00:26:24.549
BILLION DOLLARS OVER TWENTY FIVE

00:26:24.616 --> 00:26:25.817
YEARS THAT'S OVER A HUNDRED AND

00:26:25.884 --> 00:26:27.752
FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS AND YOU

00:26:27.819 --> 00:26:29.087
CANNOT HAVE A PLAN THAT'S NOT

00:26:29.154 --> 00:26:31.222
FULLY FUNDED ATTORNEY NOW NOW

00:26:32.624 --> 00:26:34.559
WE ARE EXPERIENCING A

00:26:34.626 --> 00:26:35.961
POPULATION SHIFTS AND SOFT

00:26:38.029 --> 00:26:40.532
NOW THE LARGEST GENERATION

00:26:40.899 --> 00:26:42.400
IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

00:26:42.467 --> 00:26:44.035
TODAY IS THE MULLIN ENGINE IF

00:26:45.737 --> 00:26:46.771
AND I'M AND EXHIBITS AND

00:26:46.838 --> 00:26:48.373
MILLIONS I HAVE TO A TOM SO I

00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:49.741
CAN TELL YOU ANYTHING YOU WANT

00:26:49.808 --> 00:26:51.343
TO KNOW BUT THEY ARE HITTING THE

00:26:51.409 --> 00:26:54.012
DIFFERENCES WISH WE DON'T KNOW

00:26:54.079 --> 00:26:56.448
LEARNING A LOT ABOUT THAT

00:26:56.514 --> 00:26:57.949
BEHAVIOR AND IT'S IN FACT THAT

00:26:58.016 --> 00:27:00.018
CONSTITUTION AND HOUSING CHOICES

00:27:01.086 --> 00:27:03.788
BUT THAT HEAVIER IS IT IS

00:27:03.855 --> 00:27:06.224
NOT CLEAR BUT IT'S DIFFERENT

00:27:06.291 --> 00:27:08.226
ON THE BEDROOMS THAT DELAYING

00:27:08.293 --> 00:27:09.461
THE MISSING THAT DELAYING THE

00:27:09.527 --> 00:27:11.396
-- GETTING LICENSES THEY'RE

00:27:11.463 --> 00:27:13.398
DELAYING THEIR -- GETTING

00:27:13.465 --> 00:27:15.200
MANAGEMENT OF THE NOT HAVING

00:27:15.266 --> 00:27:17.268
AS MANY KIDS ALL OF THAT WILL

00:27:17.335 --> 00:27:18.837
IMPACT THE FUTURE AND THE AND

00:27:18.903 --> 00:27:19.871
THE REASON I'M MENTIONING THAT

00:27:19.938 --> 00:27:21.306
IS BECAUSE WE ARE PLANNING FOR

00:27:21.373 --> 00:27:23.541
THE FUTURE GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE

00:27:24.442 --> 00:27:26.678
AND THEN WHAT THE SAM'S I WILL

00:27:26.745 --> 00:27:29.014
HAVE A GROWING NUMBER OF SENIOR

00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:31.616
CITIZEN THIS OUR SIXTY

00:27:31.683 --> 00:27:33.685
FIVE PLUS IN THE NEXT TWENTY

00:27:33.752 --> 00:27:35.653
YEARS OF THE SEASON WILL MAKE

00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:37.088
UP ABOUT TWENTY PERCENT OF THE

00:27:37.155 --> 00:27:38.623
POPULATION EIGHTEEN PERCENT OF

00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:40.792
THE POPULATION TO BE EXACT TEN

00:27:40.859 --> 00:27:42.394
THOUSAND UNLESS WE COME SIXTY

00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:44.996
FIVE AND ALL THAT EVERY DAY

00:27:46.231 --> 00:27:47.766
AND THAT ALSO HAS AN APPLICATION

00:27:47.832 --> 00:27:49.167
ON TRANSPORTATION AND HOUSING

00:27:49.234 --> 00:27:52.070
GO TO THE NEXT LIFE SO

00:27:52.137 --> 00:27:53.671
WHY THE MILLIONS THAT IMPORTANT

00:27:53.738 --> 00:27:54.773
I MEAN VIETNAMESE RACING IS

00:27:54.839 --> 00:27:56.841
THE THE SMALL A BLUEPRINT

00:27:56.908 --> 00:27:59.077
FOOTPRINT IN THE SHARE ECONOMY

00:27:59.277 --> 00:28:00.712
THE INTERNET OF EVERYTHING

00:28:00.779 --> 00:28:02.213
BIG DATA DATA LIVE ANYTHING

00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:04.249
WHAT DOES NOT ONLY FOR ALL

00:28:04.315 --> 00:28:05.650
OF US WHEN WE PLAN FOR THE

00:28:05.717 --> 00:28:08.186
FUTURE -- IT'LL -- WILL

00:28:08.253 --> 00:28:09.487
ALLOW FINISHED LET'S WATCH

00:28:09.554 --> 00:28:11.956
-- I VIDEO BY THE MOMENT IN

00:28:13.558 --> 00:28:14.692
AS A MILLENNIAL I'M PART OF

00:28:14.759 --> 00:28:16.361
THE MOST ADVANCED COP OF HUMANS

00:28:16.428 --> 00:28:18.363
AT OUR SPECIES HAS EVER SEEN

00:28:34.446 --> 00:28:35.747
ASSOCIATE WITH THEM IN PERSON

00:28:35.814 --> 00:28:37.715
ANYMORE AND I CAN SAY WITH

00:28:37.782 --> 00:28:40.018
CONFIDENCE I HAVE LITERALLY

00:28:40.085 --> 00:28:41.986
NEVER HELD EYE CONTACT WITH

00:28:42.053 --> 00:28:44.722
ANYONE HOW OLD MY I'M

MILLENNIAL I DON'T I TEN

OF FIVE WITHOUT A HITCH IT

00:28:52.797 --> 00:28:54.032
IS DISCRIMINATION TO THINK

00:28:54.099 --> 00:28:55.867
THAT I'M AS OLD AS MY AGE

00:28:59.037 --> 00:29:01.806
NOW I'M SIXTY FIVE WHICH

00:29:01.873 --> 00:29:03.141
MEANS I SHOULD QUALIFIED TO GET

SOCIAL SECURITY CHECKS EVERY

00:29:04.609 --> 00:29:06.211

TAKES UNTIL THE NEXT DAY FOR

00:29:10.081 --> 00:29:11.883
A TERRORIZED ME WHAT KIND OF

00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:13.585
THE S. IS THAT THAT I HAVE TO

00:29:13.651 --> 00:29:15.186
WAIT ALMOST TWENTY FOUR HOURS

00:29:15.253 --> 00:29:16.621
TO GET MY NEW COLD BREW COFFEE

A PETITION AGAINST AMAZON

00:29:22.627 --> 00:29:23.795
BUT I GOT TIRED OF ALL THE

00:29:23.862 --> 00:29:25.230
WORK IT ENTAIL BEFORE I SENT

00:29:25.296 --> 00:29:27.332
IT OUT TO ANYONE BUT STILL

00:29:27.866 --> 00:29:29.400
WHEN I WAS A KID I ALWAYS

WHEN THEY NEED TO MAKE PUBLIC

00:31:57.482 --> 00:31:58.716
TRANSPORTATION CONVENIENT

00:32:00.318 --> 00:32:01.452
WE NEED TO GET THE PEOPLE TO

00:32:01.519 --> 00:32:03.321
THEIR STATIONS FROM THEIR HOUSES

00:32:03.688 --> 00:32:05.223

THEIR DESTINATION FOR THE JOB

00:32:07.892 --> 00:32:09.193
AND HOW DO I MAKE IT CONVENIENT

00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:11.429
BY INVESTORS TING IN THE FIRST

00:32:11.496 --> 00:32:12.897
AND LAST MILE ITEM NUMBER WE

00:32:12.964 --> 00:32:15.199
STARTED WITH METRO -- WENT

00:32:15.266 --> 00:32:17.001
WHEN I WAS THERE DOING WAS CAT

IN ADDITION TO THIS WEB BECAUSE

00:32:23.741 --> 00:32:25.143
UNLESS YOU MAKE IT CONVENIENT

00:32:25.677 --> 00:32:28.279

PERIOD OF TIME PRE DETOUR SO

01:08:29.538 --> 01:08:30.506

OF THESE CROSSINGS BUT FOR SOME

01:08:51.093 --> 01:08:52.461
OF THE FINANCIAL ISSUES THAT WE

PARTNERS AT METRO -- ALWAYS

01:09:08.511 --> 01:09:10.012
ANTICIPATING THAT BECAUSE THESE

ARE ESTIMATES -- THESE ESTIMATES

01:09:11.847 --> 01:09:13.516

THAN WE ANTICIPATED AND WHEN WE

01:09:28.697 --> 01:09:30.032
WENT TO THE SUPREME WITH METRO

01:09:30.099 --> 01:09:32.401
WE HAVE SERIES OF STEPS THAT

01:09:32.468 --> 01:09:34.570
WE WILL GO THROUGH -- TO FIND

01:09:34.637 --> 01:09:35.838
OTHER MONEY MAKE CHANGES TO THE

01:09:35.905 --> 01:09:37.439
PROJECT EVERYTHING FROM MINOR

01:09:37.506 --> 01:09:39.308
CHANGES TO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES

01:09:39.375 --> 01:09:40.609
INCLUDING CHANGING THE SCOPE

01:09:40.676 --> 01:09:42.044
OF THE PROJECT WHICH WOULD BE

01:09:42.111 --> 01:09:43.212
UNFORTUNATE BUT THAT'S SOMETHING

01:09:43.279 --> 01:09:44.713
THAT WE MAY HAVE TO DO --

01:09:44.780 --> 01:09:46.181
LOOKING DEPENDING ON WHAT WE'RE

01:09:46.248 --> 01:09:47.616
THE ESTIMATES COMMITTEE WILL

01:09:47.683 --> 01:09:49.351
ALSO HAVE POTENTIAL OF COMING TO

01:09:49.418 --> 01:09:50.686
THE STATE LOOKING FOR ADDITIONAL

01:09:50.753 --> 01:09:52.087
CAP AND TRADE DOLLARS IN THE

01:09:52.154 --> 01:09:54.089
FUTURE AROUND -- IN LOOKING AT

01:09:54.156 --> 01:09:56.325
OTHER POTENTIAL FINANCING OF THE

01:09:56.392 --> 01:09:58.327
JOB THAT WE CAN DO TO MAKE IT

01:09:58.394 --> 01:09:59.828
MORE ECONOMICAL IF IT COMES TO

01:09:59.895 --> 01:10:02.431
THAT OKAY SO MY WORRY MY CONCERN

01:10:02.498 --> 01:10:04.099
IS THAT ORIGINALLY THE MONEY

01:10:04.166 --> 01:10:05.601

THAT BECAUSE THAT WAS ALMOST

01:10:16.879 --> 01:10:18.013
SIX TIMES MORE THAN WHAT YOU

01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:20.149
ORIGINALLY ASKED FOR SO I JUST

01:10:20.215 --> 01:10:20.983

AND THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS IS

01:18:32.541 --> 01:18:33.575
THE CAN ACTIVITY THAT WE'RE

01:18:33.642 --> 01:18:35.377
CREATING IN TRANSIT SYSTEMS

01:18:35.444 --> 01:18:37.212
IN OUR COUNTY BUT THIS IS ONLY

FORWARD IF WE CAN MOVE TO THE

01:18:40.148 --> 01:18:41.716
NEXT SLIDE WE'RE MOVING FORWARD

01:18:42.050 --> 01:18:43.885
-- ANY ANY IN PROCUREMENT

RIGHT NOW TO BUILD A NINE MILE

01:18:46.188 --> 01:18:47.255
EXTENSION OF THE METRO LINK

01:18:47.322 --> 01:18:48.457
SYSTEMS FROM THE ENTRANCE A

01:18:48.523 --> 01:18:49.357
CENTER IN THE HEART OF THE

01:18:49.424 --> 01:18:51.460

THE EASTERN PART OF THE PART OF

01:19:00.502 --> 01:19:02.237
OUR DAHLE WHICH THEN ALSO OPENS

01:19:02.304 --> 01:19:04.172
UP THE METROLINK SYSTEM DOWN

01:19:04.239 --> 01:19:05.774
TO THE COACHELLA VALLEY AS WELL

01:19:07.142 --> 01:19:08.944
ONE OF THE REALLY INTERESTING

01:19:09.010 --> 01:19:10.812
FAXES THAT I WANT TO POINT OUT

01:19:10.879 --> 01:19:13.281
HERE IS WHAT OPERATE METROLINK

01:19:13.348 --> 01:19:14.716
TRAINS ONCE IN THE MORNING

01:19:14.783 --> 01:19:16.118

SERVICE SPECIFICALLY TO PICK UP

01:19:20.122 --> 01:19:22.691
P. COMMUTER TRAFFIC BUT BUT

01:19:22.757 --> 01:19:24.259
OFF PEAK HOURS WERE ACTUALLY

01:19:24.326 --> 01:19:25.794
GONNA IN INTERVIEWS A DIFFERENT

01:19:25.861 --> 01:19:27.429
SERVICE MODEL RUNNING MORE

01:19:27.496 --> 01:19:29.531
FREQUENT SERVICE USING A DIESEL

01:19:29.598 --> 01:19:31.199
MULTIPLE UNIT WHICH IF ANYBODY

01:19:31.266 --> 01:19:33.635
HAS USE THE SPRINTER SYSTEM THAT

01:19:33.702 --> 01:19:34.870
RUNS ALONG THE SEVENTY EIGHT

01:19:34.936 --> 01:19:36.471
BETWEEN OCEANSIDE AND ESCONDIDO

01:19:36.538 --> 01:19:37.706
YOU GET A SENSE OF WHAT THAT

01:19:37.772 --> 01:19:39.107
VEHICLE LOOKS LIKE I'LL HAVE AN

01:19:39.174 --> 01:19:41.243
IMAGE LATER BUT THE REALLY COOL

01:19:41.309 --> 01:19:43.678
THING ABOUT THAT IS THAT

01:19:43.745 --> 01:19:45.213
VEHICLE TO SITES NOW MEETS THE

01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:46.781
FEDERAL RAILROAD ADMINISTRATION

01:19:46.848 --> 01:19:47.949
USE CRASH COMPLIANCE

01:19:48.016 --> 01:19:49.351
REQUIREMENTS WHICH MEANS THAT

01:19:49.417 --> 01:19:50.919
WE CAN ACTUALLY OPERATE THAT

01:19:50.986 --> 01:19:52.787
VEHICLE INTERMIXED WITH THE

01:19:52.854 --> 01:19:54.289
HEAVY PASSENGER RAIL MODEL

01:19:54.356 --> 01:19:55.991
THAT IS MUCH LIKE TODAY AND

01:19:56.057 --> 01:19:57.492
INTERMIXED WITH FOR EIGHT AND

01:19:57.559 --> 01:19:58.593
WE'LL GET BACK TO THAT POINT AS

01:19:58.660 --> 01:20:00.428
WELL ON A FEW MINUTES SO NOW I

01:20:00.495 --> 01:20:02.030
WANT TO JUST TALK ABOUT KIND OF

01:20:02.097 --> 01:20:04.099
WHERE WE ARE MOVED BACK TO KIND

01:20:04.166 --> 01:20:06.001
OF THIS PORTION OF THE WESTERN

01:20:06.067 --> 01:20:07.469
PORTION OF OUR COUNTY AND AND

01:20:07.536 --> 01:20:09.304
THEY CAN ACTIVITY TO THE EASTERN

01:20:09.371 --> 01:20:11.239
PORTION OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY

01:20:12.107 --> 01:20:13.708
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO OR AGENCY

01:20:13.775 --> 01:20:15.377
COMPLETED AN INTERNAL STUDY

01:20:15.777 --> 01:20:17.679
THAT LOOKED AT AND DIFFERENT

01:20:17.746 --> 01:20:20.482
ALTERNATIVES TO BRING

01:20:20.549 --> 01:20:22.450
TRANSACTIONS -- INTO THE ONTARIO

01:20:22.517 --> 01:20:24.452
INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT PROPERTY

01:20:24.886 --> 01:20:26.688
AND WE WE STARTED WITH A VERY

01:20:26.755 --> 01:20:29.191
BROAD SUITE OF OPTIONS AND

01:20:29.257 --> 01:20:30.458
NARROWED IT DOWN TO REALLY

01:20:30.525 --> 01:20:32.928
TO ALTERNATIVES ONE BEING

01:20:32.994 --> 01:20:34.496
AN EXTENSION OF THE GOAL LINE

01:20:34.763 --> 01:20:36.131
FROM MONTCLAIR DOWN TO THE

01:20:36.198 --> 01:20:38.233
ONTARIO PROPERTY AND THE SECOND

01:20:38.300 --> 01:20:40.068
BEING A CONNECTION OUT OF THE

01:20:40.135 --> 01:20:42.237
RANCHO CUCAMONGA STATION CLOSE

01:20:42.304 --> 01:20:44.206
TO WHERE WE ARE HERE INTO THE

01:20:44.272 --> 01:20:45.807
AIRPORT PROPERTY CONNECTING AND

01:20:45.874 --> 01:20:47.876
METROLINK SYSTEMS DOWN INTO THAT

01:20:47.943 --> 01:20:49.678
PROPERTY -- BOTH OF THEM ARE

01:20:49.744 --> 01:20:51.980
-- SIMILARLY -- PRICE WHEN YOU

01:20:52.047 --> 01:20:53.448
LOOK AT THE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS

01:20:53.715 --> 01:20:54.649
THE ONE OF THE THINGS ONE OF

01:20:54.716 --> 01:20:55.917
THE QUESTIONS WE ASKED IN THE

01:20:55.984 --> 01:20:57.485
STUDY WAS THE BENEFIT AND IF

01:20:57.552 --> 01:20:58.553
YOU LOOK AT THE MAP RIGHT HERE

01:20:58.620 --> 01:20:59.955
AND I DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO

01:21:00.021 --> 01:21:02.257
USE A POINTER WITH THESE THESE

01:21:02.324 --> 01:21:03.458
THE WAY WE'RE PRESENTING HERE

01:21:03.525 --> 01:21:06.061
TODAY BUT I MEAN THE GOAL LINE

01:21:06.127 --> 01:21:08.330
EXTENSION ESSENTIALLY CUTS

01:21:08.396 --> 01:21:10.799
THROUGH THE WESTERN EDGE OF

01:21:10.865 --> 01:21:13.001
SAM'S COUNTY AND SO WHEN YOU

01:21:13.068 --> 01:21:15.070
CONSIDER THAT THE TAXPAYERS OF

01:21:15.136 --> 01:21:16.671
SAN BENITO COUNTY OF THE ONES

01:21:16.738 --> 01:21:18.406
THAT ARE GOING TO BE FUNDING

01:21:18.473 --> 01:21:20.775
ON ANY ANY INVESTMENTS THIS TO

01:21:20.842 --> 01:21:22.577
ANY CONNECTIONS TO THE ONTARIO

01:21:22.644 --> 01:21:24.112
INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT WE

01:21:24.179 --> 01:21:26.314
NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE

01:21:26.381 --> 01:21:29.084
RECOGNIZING THAT CONTRIBUTION

01:21:29.150 --> 01:21:31.152
AND MAKING SURE THAT THEY INDEED

01:21:31.219 --> 01:21:32.821
ARE BENEFITING FROM THAT --

01:21:32.887 --> 01:21:34.589
SIGNIFICANTLY AND SO THAT'S

01:21:34.656 --> 01:21:36.424
ONE OF THE PARAMETERS OF THE

01:21:36.491 --> 01:21:38.159
WE'RE CONTINUING TO GRAPPLE

01:21:38.226 --> 01:21:39.494
WITH THIS WE LOOK AT WHAT IS

01:21:39.561 --> 01:21:40.829
THE RIGHT INVESTMENT TO GET INTO

01:21:40.895 --> 01:21:43.231
THE AIRPORT PROPERTY ANOTHER

01:21:43.298 --> 01:21:44.566
STUDY THAT WE JUST RECENTLY

01:21:44.833 --> 01:21:47.068
COMPLETED WAS WITH LA A METRO

01:21:47.502 --> 01:21:48.770
AND IT REALLY GETS BACK TO USE

01:21:48.837 --> 01:21:51.306
MY COMMENTS ABOUT THE THE DM USE

01:21:51.706 --> 01:21:53.441
THE EIGHT MEETING FIRE'S CRASH

01:21:53.508 --> 01:21:54.943
COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS AND SO

01:21:55.010 --> 01:21:57.112
THEY CAN OPERATE ON EXISTING

01:21:57.178 --> 01:21:59.180
INFRASTRUCTURE ON THE EXISTING

01:21:59.247 --> 01:22:01.149
-- METROLINK SYSTEMS AND SO

01:22:01.216 --> 01:22:02.751
WE STUDIED WITH LA MEASURE

01:22:02.817 --> 01:22:05.620
THE IDEA OF OF REPLACING

01:22:05.687 --> 01:22:07.856
OFF PEAK METROLINK SERVICE

01:22:08.356 --> 01:22:10.191
WITH THE DMU SERVICE ALL THE WAY

01:22:10.258 --> 01:22:12.494
INTO TO UNION STATION -- THERE'S

01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:14.896
A A PINCH POINT -- JUST EAST

01:22:14.963 --> 01:22:16.731
OF EL MONTE IS YOU GET PAST --

01:22:16.798 --> 01:22:17.899
LAKE CITY COLLEGE IF YOU KNOW

01:22:17.966 --> 01:22:18.933
YOUR RUNNING THROUGH THE THE

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:20.635
CENTER OF THE FREEWAY THERE --

01:22:20.702 --> 01:22:21.870
AND SO THERE'S SOME DIFFICULTIES

01:22:21.936 --> 01:22:23.071
TRYING INTERVIEWS MORE FREQUENT

01:22:23.138 --> 01:22:25.607
SERVICE IN THAT PORTION -- BUT

01:22:25.674 --> 01:22:27.275
CERTAINLY FOR A VERY LIMITED

01:22:27.342 --> 01:22:29.077
CAPITAL INVESTMENTS TO A LARGELY

01:22:29.144 --> 01:22:30.779
JUST PURCHASES VEHICLES YOU CAN

01:22:30.845 --> 01:22:32.447
ENTITIES SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER

01:22:32.514 --> 01:22:34.516
FREQUENCIES -- ON THAT LINE THEN

01:22:34.582 --> 01:22:36.217
YOU HAVE TODAY DURING OFF PEAK

01:22:36.284 --> 01:22:37.952
HOURS AND THE REASON IS THAT

01:22:38.019 --> 01:22:39.921
SENATE'S ORDER -- AND BE POINTED

01:22:39.988 --> 01:22:41.589
TO THIS -- ALONG THE GOAL LINE

01:22:41.856 --> 01:22:43.692
WE'RE SEEING TRANSIT ORIENTED

01:22:43.758 --> 01:22:45.827
DEVELOPMENT CROPPING UP ALL

01:22:45.894 --> 01:22:47.362
ALONG THE SAME READING A LINE IN

01:22:47.429 --> 01:22:50.298
BOTH COUNTIES AND SO THE DEMAND

01:22:50.365 --> 01:22:51.733
AND THE TWO YEAR DEEP BRAIN

01:22:51.933 --> 01:22:53.902
IS DIFFERENT THAN THE CURRENT

01:22:53.968 --> 01:22:55.837
MODEL THAT METRO X.'ERS WHICH

01:22:55.904 --> 01:22:58.606
IS A COMMUTER SERVICE PRIMARILY

01:22:58.673 --> 01:23:00.709
FOCUSED ON MOVING PEOPLE FROM

01:23:00.775 --> 01:23:02.143
THE OUTLYING COMMUNITIES INTO

01:23:02.210 --> 01:23:03.845
DOWNTOWN LA AND THEN BACK IN THE

01:23:03.912 --> 01:23:06.614
EVENINGS -- YOU'RE GONNA

01:23:06.681 --> 01:23:08.416
HEAR A IN A FEW MINUTES FROM

01:23:08.483 --> 01:23:10.051
STEVE SOCKS YOU MENTIONED MR

01:23:10.118 --> 01:23:11.720
CHAIR TO THAT HE'S GOING TO TALK

01:23:11.786 --> 01:23:13.588
ABOUT THE SKAGGS STUDIES REALLY

01:23:13.655 --> 01:23:14.923
LOOKED AT THE INTER CONNECTED

01:23:14.989 --> 01:23:16.191
MIDI ISSUES BETWEEN THE TWO

01:23:16.257 --> 01:23:18.293
COUNTIES AND I WANT TO THANK US

01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:20.829
ON AND THINK STEVEN AND THE TEAM

01:23:20.895 --> 01:23:22.263
THAT WORKED ON THAT IT'S IT'S

01:23:22.330 --> 01:23:24.733
BEEN A LONG LABORIOUS PROCESS

01:23:24.799 --> 01:23:26.201
BUT AN IMPORTANT PROCESS TO

01:23:26.267 --> 01:23:28.269
REALLY TRY TO HONE IN ON WHAT

01:23:28.336 --> 01:23:30.205
IS THE RIGHT INVESTMENTS MOVING

01:23:30.271 --> 01:23:32.841
FORWARD AND THE RECOMMENDATION

01:23:32.907 --> 01:23:34.242
ARISING OUT OF THAT IS THAT

01:23:34.309 --> 01:23:36.077
THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE WORK --

01:23:36.144 --> 01:23:38.780
AND AND WE HAD TO SPC TA OR

01:23:38.847 --> 01:23:40.749
ARE CERTAINLY WELCOMING THE

01:23:40.815 --> 01:23:42.117
OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE THE

01:23:42.183 --> 01:23:43.852
DIALOGUE WE'VE ALREADY THE

WORLDWIDE PLAYER IN THAT FIELD

01:23:57.198 --> 01:23:59.467
OUT OF RED LINES WE BROUGHT IN

01:23:59.534 --> 01:24:02.036
-- BUSINESS -- COALITION

01:24:02.103 --> 01:24:03.905
IS BROUGHT IN ON UNIVERSITY CAL

WE GOING TO MOVE FORWARD TO

01:24:19.287 --> 01:24:21.389
CREATE THAT CAN ACTIVITY --

01:24:21.456 --> 01:24:22.524
IT'S BECOMING THE WARM WARM

01:24:22.590 --> 01:24:23.691
PART YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM

01:24:23.758 --> 01:24:25.560
ALLEN WANT IF YOU MINUTES --

01:24:25.627 --> 01:24:26.861
ON KIND OF THE PROJECTIONS

01:24:26.928 --> 01:24:27.796
FROM THE AIRPORT AND WHEN

01:24:27.862 --> 01:24:29.831
AND WHY THIS IS BECOMING AN

01:24:29.898 --> 01:24:31.065
ISSUE THAT WE REALLY NEED

01:24:31.132 --> 01:24:33.234
TO GRAPPLE WITH VERY QUICKLY

01:24:33.768 --> 01:24:35.970
BUT -- WE'RE ACTUALLY OF THE

01:24:36.037 --> 01:24:37.839
ROUND TABLES CONVENING AGAIN

01:24:37.906 --> 01:24:39.741
IN MID NOVEMBER AND WE'RE GONNA

01:24:39.974 --> 01:24:41.376
WE'RE GONNA GIVE AN UPDATE ON

01:24:41.443 --> 01:24:43.244
THE AIRPORT -- ON THE PASSENGER

01:24:43.311 --> 01:24:44.846
DEMAND GROWTH EXPECTED THROUGH

01:24:44.913 --> 01:24:47.348
TWENTY FORTY -- FROM WHERE

01:24:47.415 --> 01:24:48.850
IT IS TODAY AND THE SIGNIFICANCE

01:24:48.917 --> 01:24:50.552
OF THAT RAMP UP WE'RE ALSO

01:24:50.618 --> 01:24:51.820
GOING TO START TALKING ABOUT

01:24:51.886 --> 01:24:54.456
-- YOU KNOW WHERE IS THE LIKELY

01:24:54.522 --> 01:24:57.125
HOOD OF A STATION CITING ON OR

01:24:57.192 --> 01:24:59.060
NEAR THE ONTARIO INTERNATIONAL

01:24:59.127 --> 01:25:01.162
AIRPORT PROPERTY -- WE'RE GONNA

01:25:01.229 --> 01:25:02.096
GONNA GIVE AN UPDATE ON THE

01:25:02.163 --> 01:25:03.364
SKETCH THAT HE THAT YOU'LL ALSO

01:25:03.431 --> 01:25:05.300
HEAR TODAY'S REPORTING OUT ON

01:25:05.366 --> 01:25:07.035
RESULTS AND THEN DISCUSS WHAT

01:25:07.101 --> 01:25:08.203
OUR NEXT STEPS ARE AND IT'S

01:25:08.269 --> 01:25:10.472
IMPORTANT AGAIN -- GIVEN THE

01:25:10.538 --> 01:25:11.739
THE GROWTH PROJECTIONS THAT

01:25:11.806 --> 01:25:13.007
WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO MOVE

01:25:13.074 --> 01:25:15.076
THIS DIALOGUE FORWARD -- YOU

01:25:15.143 --> 01:25:16.678
CAN HEAR I THINK SMART LATER

01:25:16.744 --> 01:25:18.480
ON THIS PANEL AS WELL ABOUT --

01:25:18.546 --> 01:25:19.848
THE SUCCESS THIS METROLINK IS

01:25:19.914 --> 01:25:22.050
HAD AND THEIR SCORE APPLICATION

01:25:22.550 --> 01:25:24.619
IT'S A A GREAT INVESTMENT BY THE

01:25:24.686 --> 01:25:26.821
STATE RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE

01:25:27.222 --> 01:25:28.590
OF THE METROLINK SERVICE

01:25:28.656 --> 01:25:30.925
THROUGHOUT -- THE FIVE COUNTY

01:25:30.992 --> 01:25:33.561
REGION AND -- ONE OF THE KEY

01:25:33.628 --> 01:25:34.896
THINGS ON THE SAN BERNARDINO

01:25:34.963 --> 01:25:36.831
ONLINE IS A RECOGNITION THAT

01:25:36.898 --> 01:25:38.199
WE NEED TO AT LEAST GET TO

01:25:38.266 --> 01:25:39.968
THIRTY MINUTES BI DIRECTIONAL

01:25:40.235 --> 01:25:42.370
SERVICE FREQUENCIES AND SO

01:25:42.437 --> 01:25:43.805
THERE'S THIS FUNDING IN THAT

01:25:43.872 --> 01:25:46.074
PLAN TO HELP US GET THERE THERE

01:25:47.809 --> 01:25:49.477
WITH AGAIN THIS HIGHLIGHTS THE

01:25:49.544 --> 01:25:52.347
THE GROWING LEAD THAT TOT ALONG

01:25:52.413 --> 01:25:54.349
THIS LINE BOTH COUNTIES IS

01:25:54.415 --> 01:25:56.251
BROUGHT TO THE FOREFRONT OF THE

01:25:56.317 --> 01:25:57.485
RIDERSHIP ON DECEMBER EIGHTEEN

01:25:57.552 --> 01:25:58.820
ONLINE IS ONE OF THE HIGHEST

01:25:58.887 --> 01:26:00.421
IN THE ENTIRE METROLINK SERVICE

01:26:00.488 --> 01:26:01.856
AND I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT

01:26:02.223 --> 01:26:03.892
AGAIN WHEN WE TALK ABOUT WHAT

01:26:03.958 --> 01:26:05.393
IS THE RIGHT CONNECTIONS TO

01:26:05.460 --> 01:26:07.128
MAKE INTO THE AIRPORT PROPERTY

01:26:07.629 --> 01:26:09.197
-- WITH THE EXTENSION TO THE

01:26:09.264 --> 01:26:10.965
UNIVERSITY OF REDLANDS AS MUCH

01:26:11.032 --> 01:26:12.967
LIKE SERVICE IN THE DMU SERVICE

01:26:13.334 --> 01:26:14.636
WE'RE GOING TO USE THAT AGAIN AS

01:26:14.702 --> 01:26:16.471
I MENTIONED EARLIER OPEN UP NOT

01:26:16.538 --> 01:26:18.640
ONLY THE EAST VALLEY BUT PEOPLE

01:26:18.706 --> 01:26:20.008
THAT COME FROM AS FAR AWAY AS

01:26:20.074 --> 01:26:21.242
THE COACHELLA VALLEY CAN NOW

01:26:21.309 --> 01:26:23.177
USE TRANSIT ONCE THEY GET INTO

01:26:23.244 --> 01:26:25.113
THE SAME READING OF THE ALLEY TO

01:26:25.179 --> 01:26:26.514
REALLY GET ANYWHERE IN SOUTHERN

01:26:26.581 --> 01:26:28.349
CALIFORNIA SO I THINK THIS IS

01:26:28.416 --> 01:26:30.385
REALLY EXCITING TIMES BUT THE

01:26:30.451 --> 01:26:32.053
SAM READING ONLINE ALSO LATELY

01:26:32.120 --> 01:26:33.588
WE DO TALK ABOUT CONNECTIVITY

01:26:33.655 --> 01:26:35.323
THE AIRPORT NOT ONLY

01:26:36.291 --> 01:26:37.992
HELPS BRING IN PEOPLE FROM THE

01:26:38.059 --> 01:26:39.527
EASTERN PART OF THIS COUNTY

01:26:39.594 --> 01:26:41.296
AND IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY BUT

01:26:41.362 --> 01:26:43.631
ALSO FROM LA COUNTY FROM UNION

01:26:43.698 --> 01:26:45.400
STATION ALL THE WAY TO THE

01:26:45.466 --> 01:26:47.035
AIRPORT PROPERTY SO THERE'S I

01:26:47.101 --> 01:26:48.836
THINK THURMOND THIS OPPORTUNITY

01:26:49.270 --> 01:26:50.471
-- BELIEVE THAT A LOT OF WORK

01:26:50.538 --> 01:26:52.440
TO DO IF WE COULD GO TO THE LAST

01:26:52.507 --> 01:26:54.842
SLIDE I THINK ONE OF THE MOST

01:26:54.909 --> 01:26:56.077
EXCITING THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN

01:26:56.144 --> 01:26:58.212
WORKING ON THIS BCT A FOR THE

01:26:58.279 --> 01:27:00.381
LAST SEVERAL YEARS NOW I TALKED

01:27:00.448 --> 01:27:01.883
ABOUT THE DIESEL MULTIPLE UNITS

01:27:01.950 --> 01:27:03.484
AND THIS IS AN IMAGE OF WHAT

01:27:03.551 --> 01:27:04.719
WE'RE ACTUALLY FOR CARING FOR

01:27:04.786 --> 01:27:05.954
OUR REDLANDS PASSIONATE RAIL

01:27:06.020 --> 01:27:07.589
SERVICE AND YOU SEE THERE'S

01:27:07.655 --> 01:27:08.756
THREE VEHICLES THEY'RE THEY'RE

01:27:08.823 --> 01:27:09.924
CONNECTING THERE'S A LEADING

01:27:09.991 --> 01:27:11.659
AND TRAILING CAR THERE --

01:27:11.726 --> 01:27:12.927
INTERCHANGEABLE SO THE TRAIN

01:27:12.994 --> 01:27:15.163
CAN MOVE BACK AND FORTH AT WILL

01:27:15.563 --> 01:27:17.031
BUT -- IN THE MIDDLE THERE IS

01:27:17.098 --> 01:27:18.566
THE -- THE POWER OUR VEHICLE

01:27:18.633 --> 01:27:20.802
THE POWER AND WHAT THEY DO IS

01:27:20.868 --> 01:27:22.470
THEY HAVE DIESELS CHAIR FOR

01:27:22.537 --> 01:27:24.105
DIESEL GENERATORS AND THAT'S

01:27:24.172 --> 01:27:25.607
GOOD BECAUSE THAT'S THE CLEANEST

01:27:25.673 --> 01:27:26.975
DIESEL TECHNOLOGY THAT'S OUT

01:27:27.041 --> 01:27:28.543
THERE TODAY BUT WE ARE YOU

01:27:28.610 --> 01:27:30.445
ARE YOU BEING IN THE WORST AIR

01:27:30.511 --> 01:27:32.847
QUALITY BASES IN THE

01:27:32.914 --> 01:27:34.549
COUNTRY THAT THAT WASN'T WHAT

01:27:34.616 --> 01:27:36.284
IT ENOUGH AND WE'RE INTRODUCING

01:27:36.351 --> 01:27:38.052
THE SERVICE IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE

01:27:38.519 --> 01:27:39.921
IT JUST DIDN'T SEEM LIKE IT MADE

01:27:39.988 --> 01:27:41.456
SENSE ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU PAID

01:27:41.522 --> 01:27:43.157
ATTENTION TO WHAT TEST LESS THAN

01:27:43.224 --> 01:27:44.926
DOING AND AND THE ADVANCEMENTS

01:27:45.560 --> 01:27:47.395
IN ZERO EMISSION TECHNOLOGY

01:27:47.462 --> 01:27:50.164
VEHICLES -- AT DIFFERENT LEVELS

01:27:50.231 --> 01:27:52.867
OF OF THE SPECTRUM AND SO

01:27:53.067 --> 01:27:54.669
WE DID DID WE WERE SUCCESSFUL IN

01:27:54.736 --> 01:27:57.438
THIS LAST ROUND HE -- GRANTS

01:27:57.972 --> 01:27:59.807
FOR -- THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS TO

01:27:59.874 --> 01:28:01.876
PURCHASE EIGHT ANOTHER VEHICLE

01:28:02.110 --> 01:28:04.045
AND TOOK AND TYLER ZERO OR NEAR

01:28:04.112 --> 01:28:06.447
ZERO EMISSION TECHNOLOGIES AND

01:28:06.514 --> 01:28:07.615
I THINK THAT'S REALLY EXCITING

01:28:07.682 --> 01:28:09.250
BECAUSE IT'S THE FIRST OF

01:28:09.317 --> 01:28:11.719
ITS KIND IN NORTH AMERICA AND

01:28:11.786 --> 01:28:13.087
WORD WORD WORD MOVING THIS

01:28:13.154 --> 01:28:15.423
FORWARD -- HERE IN SAN BENITO

01:28:15.490 --> 01:28:16.457
COUNTY AND IT'S SOMETHING

01:28:16.524 --> 01:28:18.359
THAT COULD COMPLETELY RESHAPED

01:28:18.626 --> 01:28:20.294
THE METROLINK SERVICE AT SOME

01:28:20.361 --> 01:28:22.230
POINT IN THE FUTURE WE COULD

01:28:22.296 --> 01:28:25.166
HAVE A BATTERY POWER TRAININGS

01:28:25.233 --> 01:28:26.901
THAT ARE RUNNING THROUGH OUR

01:28:26.968 --> 01:28:28.169
COUNTY AND THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE

01:28:28.236 --> 01:28:30.104
SYSTEM IN A SHORT PERIOD OF

01:28:30.171 --> 01:28:33.341
TIME AGAIN USING THE EXISTING

01:28:33.408 --> 01:28:36.611
TRACKS NOT HALF AND TO BUILD NEW

01:28:36.678 --> 01:28:38.513
SIGNIFICANTLY NEW INFRASTRUCTURE

01:28:38.579 --> 01:28:40.882
SO EXCITING TIMES WERE NOT JUST

01:28:40.948 --> 01:28:42.750
TIED TO THE IDEA OF BATTERY

01:28:42.817 --> 01:28:44.252
TECHNOLOGY BUT ALSO LOOKING

01:28:44.318 --> 01:28:46.120
AT FUEL CELL TECHNOLOGY AND

01:28:46.187 --> 01:28:47.455
SO IT TRULY IS A PILOT TO

01:28:47.522 --> 01:28:48.923
TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE

01:28:48.990 --> 01:28:51.325
BEST APPROACH IS WITH THAT'LL

01:28:51.392 --> 01:28:52.660
THAT'LL CLUED IN AND CERTAINLY

01:28:52.727 --> 01:28:54.162
ANSWER QUESTIONS AT THE END OF

01:28:54.228 --> 01:28:55.797
THE PANEL THANK YOU VERY MUCH

ALSO A RECOGNIZE AND INTRODUCE

01:29:08.776 --> 01:29:10.945
MY GOOD FRIEND OF THE MIRROR OF

01:29:11.012 --> 01:29:12.847
RANCHO CUCAMONGA DENNIS MICHAEL

GOOD MORNING A PLACE A LOW

01:29:24.926 --> 01:29:27.128
TIER OF FATHER FORM I WOULD DO

01:29:27.195 --> 01:29:28.963

YOU -- -- I'M GONNA HAVE A

01:29:31.966 --> 01:29:33.801
POWER POINT HERE TO SHOW YOU IN

01:29:33.868 --> 01:29:36.037
JUST A MOMENT I DO WANT TO POINT

01:29:36.104 --> 01:29:37.572
OUT A FEW THINGS MAKES METALINK

01:29:37.638 --> 01:29:39.140
RIDERSHIP IS ACTUALLY UP

01:29:40.675 --> 01:29:42.110
AND -- IS YOU KNOW THIS

01:29:42.176 --> 01:29:43.811
THAT'S VERY UNIQUE RIGHT NOW

01:29:43.878 --> 01:29:45.446
BECAUSE MOST TRACK TO SYSTEMS

01:29:45.980 --> 01:29:47.248
IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA HAVE

01:29:47.315 --> 01:29:49.016
EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT LOSS OF

01:29:49.083 --> 01:29:51.252
RIDERSHIP -- PART OF THE REASON

01:29:51.319 --> 01:29:52.620
FOR THIS WAS A VERY INNOVATIVE

01:29:52.687 --> 01:29:54.956
PROGRAM A FEW YEARS AGO --

01:29:55.156 --> 01:29:56.357
ELECTION WHICH I'VE NEVER SEEN

01:29:56.424 --> 01:29:58.025
TO SUCCESSFULLY CUT CUT AIRS ON

01:29:58.092 --> 01:29:59.794
THE ANTELOPE VALLEY LINE WHICH

01:29:59.861 --> 01:30:01.129
HAS ALL THE SERVICE MUCH LUCK

01:30:01.195 --> 01:30:03.464
ASSEMBLY IN THE LINE OF WRITER

01:30:03.531 --> 01:30:05.433
CHAIR CLIMBS AND SO THE OVER

01:30:05.500 --> 01:30:07.568
TIME OF WITH INCREASED RIDERSHIP

01:30:07.635 --> 01:30:09.904
XTC ACHIEVED A FARE CUT WHICH

01:30:09.971 --> 01:30:12.039
WAS REVENUE NEUTRAL ARE I'VE

01:30:12.106 --> 01:30:13.441
NEVER I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT MY

01:30:13.508 --> 01:30:14.842
CAREER BEFORE IT'S ALWAYS A WILL

01:30:14.909 --> 01:30:16.277
BUT IT DOESN'T HAPPEN VERY OFTEN

01:30:16.778 --> 01:30:18.079
SO IN JULY WHEN WE REDUCE THE

01:30:18.146 --> 01:30:19.547
FARES ON A SALMON IN A LINE TO

01:30:19.614 --> 01:30:21.582
RECEIVE THE SAME THING RIDERSHIP

01:30:21.649 --> 01:30:22.884
GROWTH GROWTH AND I BREAKING

01:30:22.950 --> 01:30:24.085
EVEN YET BUT THAT WILL CERTAINLY

01:30:24.152 --> 01:30:26.053
BE OUR OUR GOAL REMAINS IN

01:30:26.120 --> 01:30:28.089
THE SCORE PROGRAM A METAL MAKE

01:30:28.156 --> 01:30:29.857
RECEIVE OF ONE POINT TWO BILLION

01:30:29.924 --> 01:30:31.425
DOLLARS OF RACERS TYPES OF STATE

01:30:31.492 --> 01:30:33.494
MONEY A FEW MONTHS AGO -- WITH

01:30:33.561 --> 01:30:34.862
THIS WILL BE WORKING ON IMPROVE

01:30:34.929 --> 01:30:37.031
SIGNAL SYSTEMS DOUBLE TRACKING

01:30:37.098 --> 01:30:38.900
TROUBLE TRACKING WHAT THAT MEANS

01:30:38.966 --> 01:30:40.101
IS THAT MOST OF OUR SYSTEMS

01:30:40.168 --> 01:30:41.569
A TWO THIRDS OF IT IS SINGLE

01:30:41.636 --> 01:30:43.971
TRACK LIKE A ONE LANE ROAD ROAD

01:30:44.238 --> 01:30:45.740
ONE LEBRON WITH BI DIRECTIONAL

01:30:45.807 --> 01:30:47.909
TRAFFIC WHAT THAT MEANS IS IF

01:30:47.975 --> 01:30:49.210
THAT LAND GETS BLOCKED FOR ONE

01:30:49.277 --> 01:30:50.278
REASON OR ANOTHER EVERYTHING

01:30:50.344 --> 01:30:52.246
COMES TO A STOP IT LIMITS THE

01:30:52.313 --> 01:30:53.881
FREQUENCY OF THE SERVICE AND

01:30:53.948 --> 01:30:56.551
ALSO ON TIME PERFORMANCE

01:30:56.617 --> 01:30:58.786
ALSO BY CLINTON'S PROGRAM IN

01:30:58.853 --> 01:31:00.021
THE STATE ARE WE WILL BE ABLE

01:31:00.087 --> 01:31:01.522
TO OPERATE MORE FREQUENT SERVICE

01:31:01.589 --> 01:31:03.357
WAS WITH BETTER RELIABILITY

01:31:03.758 --> 01:31:04.759
IN FACT ONE OF THE THINGS I'M

01:31:04.826 --> 01:31:06.127
TALKING TO FOR EXAMPLE BURBANK

01:31:06.194 --> 01:31:08.062
AIRPORT ABOUT IS WHAT IF WE CAN

01:31:08.129 --> 01:31:09.430
GET TO THIRTY MINUTE OR FIFTEEN

01:31:09.497 --> 01:31:11.265
MINUTE FREQUENCIES FROM UNION

01:31:11.332 --> 01:31:13.301
STATION UP TO BURBANK AIRPORT I

01:31:13.367 --> 01:31:14.635
THINK ULTIMATELY WE ARE BE ARE

01:31:14.702 --> 01:31:15.670
ARE PUTTING THE SAME KIND OF

01:31:15.736 --> 01:31:17.538
FREQUENCIES ON THE SALMON IN A

01:31:17.605 --> 01:31:18.806
LINE IN THE ORANGE COUNTY LINE

01:31:19.240 --> 01:31:20.308
A LOTS OF GOOD THINGS OUT THERE

01:31:20.374 --> 01:31:22.410
HAPPEN I DO WHEN I KNOW FOR YOU

01:31:22.476 --> 01:31:24.979
THAT THAT ARE IN THE NATION

01:31:25.179 --> 01:31:28.115
-- METALINK IS A PIONEER

01:31:28.182 --> 01:31:30.251
OF POSITIVE TRAIN CONTROL THIS

01:31:30.318 --> 01:31:31.853
ALL FLOWED FROM THE CHATSWORTH

01:31:31.919 --> 01:31:33.821
ACCIDENT WHICH IS A LITTLE OVER

01:31:33.888 --> 01:31:35.556
TEN YEARS AGO WHICH RESULTED IN

01:31:36.357 --> 01:31:38.125
VERY SERIOUS ISSUES -- ISSUES

01:31:38.526 --> 01:31:40.561
-- SO THERE'S ARE A FEDERAL

01:31:40.628 --> 01:31:42.864
DEADLINE OF -- DECEMBER THIRTY

01:31:42.930 --> 01:31:44.866
ONE HAPPY TO SEE AND PLACES WE

01:31:44.932 --> 01:31:46.734
WILL BE FINE WITH THAT WORKING

01:31:46.801 --> 01:31:48.636
WITH AMTRAK AND WITH THE FREE

01:31:48.703 --> 01:31:50.338
OF ROADS I THINK WILL BE OKAY

01:31:50.838 --> 01:31:51.873
-- THERE'S GONNA BE OTHER

01:31:51.939 --> 01:31:53.040
REYNOLDS ALL AROUND THE COUNTRY

01:31:53.107 --> 01:31:55.109
WHO WILL NOT BE COMPLIANT --

01:31:55.176 --> 01:31:56.978
AND RIGHT NOW THE FRA IN THE IN

01:31:57.044 --> 01:31:58.546
THE CONGRESS AND TO BE NO MORE

01:31:58.613 --> 01:32:00.915
EXTENSIONS FOR SO -- IT'LL BE

01:32:00.982 --> 01:32:01.983
AN INTERESTING YEAR NEXT YEAR

01:32:02.049 --> 01:32:03.851
TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS BY THE WAY

01:32:03.918 --> 01:32:05.686
ATC HAS COST A LOT OF MONEY

01:32:06.087 --> 01:32:08.022
OF WE WE DID THIS BECAUSE OF

01:32:08.089 --> 01:32:09.624
THE EXPERIENCE WITH THE WITH

01:32:09.690 --> 01:32:11.592
THE ACCENT BACK WHEN WHEN OUR

01:32:11.659 --> 01:32:12.894
BOARD MEMBERS WERE COMPLETELY

01:32:12.960 --> 01:32:14.862
COMMITTED TO SAFETY AS A NUMBER

01:32:14.929 --> 01:32:16.464
ONE VALUE AND PRIORITIES SO I'M

01:32:16.530 --> 01:32:18.699
VERY PROUD OF THAT METROLINK IS

01:32:18.766 --> 01:32:20.401
EIGHTY FIVE COUNTY JOINT POWERS

01:32:20.468 --> 01:32:22.570
AUTHORITY -- WE RUN SERVICE IN

01:32:22.637 --> 01:32:24.805
SIX COUNTIES OUR FUNDING COMES

01:32:24.872 --> 01:32:26.407
PRIMARILY THROUGH THROUGH THE

01:32:26.474 --> 01:32:28.242
THE COUNTIES I WOULDN'T KNOW

01:32:28.676 --> 01:32:30.444
THAT BECAUSE MENTAL EXIST AS A

01:32:30.511 --> 01:32:32.313
COMMUTER RAILROAD THAT GENERATES

01:32:32.380 --> 01:32:33.381
A GREAT DEAL OF STATE AND

01:32:33.447 --> 01:32:34.949
LOCAL MONEY WHICH THEN GOES TO

01:32:35.016 --> 01:32:36.284
THE COUNTY SOMEONE OFFSETTING

01:32:36.350 --> 01:32:37.652
INVESTMENT WHICH THEY MAKE AND

01:32:37.718 --> 01:32:39.420
AND TO US WE RENT AMOUNT THREE

01:32:39.487 --> 01:32:41.289
HUNDRED TRAINS A DAY -- WE HAVE

01:32:41.355 --> 01:32:42.623
ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY MILES

01:32:42.690 --> 01:32:44.258
OF RUN AWAY MUCH OF WHICH IS

01:32:44.325 --> 01:32:45.693
MOST OF WHICH AS I SAID IS A

01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:47.795
SINGLE TRACK RIGHT NEXT MAYES

01:32:48.763 --> 01:32:50.264
SO THERE'S A MAP OBVIOUS YOU CAN

01:32:50.331 --> 01:32:53.200
SEE THAT OUR SYSTEM OF PARALLELS

01:32:53.267 --> 01:32:54.835
THE FIVE NORTH AND SOUTH OF ONE

01:32:54.902 --> 01:32:57.538
THIRTY FOUR OF THE SIXTY THE TEN

01:32:58.072 --> 01:33:00.241
OF A NINETY ONE -- THAT'S VERY

01:33:00.308 --> 01:33:01.175
IMPORTANT WILL COME BACK TO

01:33:01.242 --> 01:33:03.010
THAT IN A MINUTE AND LET ME

01:33:03.077 --> 01:33:04.946
JUST OBSERVE BEFORE I GO FORWARD

01:33:05.413 --> 01:33:07.682
THAT IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA OUR

01:33:07.748 --> 01:33:09.583
FREEWAY SYSTEM IS BASICALLY AT

01:33:09.650 --> 01:33:11.585
FIXED CAPACITY WHEN I WAS IN

01:33:11.652 --> 01:33:12.887
ORANGE COUNTY I THOUGHT WE WOULD

01:33:12.954 --> 01:33:14.422
WIDEN FREEWAYS ARE DOUBLE DECK

01:33:14.488 --> 01:33:16.290
FREEWAYS THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN

01:33:16.357 --> 01:33:17.525
THE PUBLIC WILL NOT ACCEPT

01:33:18.926 --> 01:33:20.294
SO WE HAVE BASICALLY A FIXED

01:33:20.361 --> 01:33:22.063
CAPACITY FREEWAY SYSTEM THERE

01:33:22.129 --> 01:33:23.264
WON'T BE ANY NEW FREEWAYS IN

01:33:23.331 --> 01:33:25.633
THE LA BASIN OTHERS ONE PROJECT

01:33:25.700 --> 01:33:26.701
IN ORANGE COUNTY IN THE MIDDLE

01:33:26.767 --> 01:33:28.669
OF FOUR OR FIVE FEW PROJECTS

01:33:28.736 --> 01:33:29.971
AND SAM AND DEAN OR OVERSIZED

01:33:30.037 --> 01:33:31.572
AT SOME POINT THE FREEWAYS ARE

01:33:31.639 --> 01:33:33.841
DONE SO WE CONFRONT GROWING

01:33:33.908 --> 01:33:36.310
POPULATION WHICH IS SPREADING

01:33:36.377 --> 01:33:37.745
OUT BECAUSE OF HOUSING COSTS

01:33:38.145 --> 01:33:39.180
IN THE IN THE INNER PART OF

01:33:39.246 --> 01:33:40.915
THE COUNTIES US WITH A GROWING

01:33:40.982 --> 01:33:42.850
POPULATION SPREADING OUT PRETTY

01:33:42.917 --> 01:33:44.285
MORE DEMAND ON THE FREEWAYS

01:33:44.485 --> 01:33:46.120
WITH A FIXED CAPACITY FREEWAY

01:33:46.187 --> 01:33:48.622
SYSTEMS NO -- I DON'T GO ON THE

01:33:48.689 --> 01:33:50.891
WEST SIDE OF LA ANYMORE MORE OF

01:33:51.092 --> 01:33:52.360
YOU KNOW IT'S TOO MISERABLE TO

01:33:52.426 --> 01:33:54.128
GET OVER THERE TO UNLESS I AM

01:33:54.195 --> 01:33:56.564
FORCED TO I DON'T DO IT -- I

01:33:56.630 --> 01:33:57.598
WOULD GO THERE TO WATCH AND

01:33:57.665 --> 01:33:59.300
SEE IF YOU SELL A HOWEVER THAT

01:33:59.367 --> 01:34:00.067
WOULD BE IT THAT WOULD BE A

01:34:00.134 --> 01:34:02.603
MERITORIOUS UP SO IT'S IMPORTANT

01:34:02.670 --> 01:34:05.006
THESE THESE THESE LINES CARILLO

01:34:05.272 --> 01:34:06.374
THE FREEWAY SYSTEM RUN COME

01:34:06.440 --> 01:34:08.142
BACK TO THAT -- AND SHOW THAT

01:34:08.209 --> 01:34:09.577
MITCHELL MAKE IS ACTUALLY AN

01:34:09.643 --> 01:34:10.878
EXCELLENT INVESTMENT FOR THE

01:34:10.945 --> 01:34:12.847
COUNTIES AND OTHERS EXPLICITLY

01:34:13.647 --> 01:34:15.816
SO -- IF WE MEASURE OF YOUR

01:34:16.183 --> 01:34:18.219
RIDERSHIP AS WE DID FOR DECADES

01:34:18.486 --> 01:34:19.920
AS BOARDINGS METAL LIKE A

01:34:19.987 --> 01:34:21.689
SMALL FORTY FORTY FIVE THOUSAND

01:34:21.756 --> 01:34:23.157
A DAY COMPARED TO ONE AND A

01:34:23.224 --> 01:34:24.959
HALF MILLION AT METRO I SOUNDS

01:34:25.026 --> 01:34:26.694
VERY SMALL BUT THE TRIPS ARE

01:34:26.761 --> 01:34:28.662
MUCH LONGER THAN THEY ARE ON

01:34:28.729 --> 01:34:30.264
ON SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BUSES

01:34:30.331 --> 01:34:31.899
ORDERS OR RAIL LINES TO THE

01:34:31.966 --> 01:34:32.833
AVERAGE TRIP LENGTH MIGHT BE

01:34:32.900 --> 01:34:34.635
FOUR MILES FOR A HALF THREE AND

01:34:34.702 --> 01:34:36.904
A HALF MILES OUR TROOPS OR ABOUT

01:34:36.971 --> 01:34:39.407
THIRTY MILES LONG SO BECAUSE

01:34:39.473 --> 01:34:40.908
THEN IF YOU MEASURE RIDERSHIP

01:34:40.975 --> 01:34:42.343
IN TERMS OF PASSENGER MILES

01:34:42.777 --> 01:34:44.111
THEN METROLINK IS THE SECOND

01:34:44.178 --> 01:34:45.746
BUSIEST CARRIER IN SOUTHERN

01:34:45.813 --> 01:34:48.082
CALIFORNIA AFTER METRO BUT

01:34:48.149 --> 01:34:49.250
HIGHER FOR EXAMPLE IN ORANGE

01:34:49.316 --> 01:34:51.352
COUNTY RIVERSIDE COMBINE BECAUSE

01:34:51.419 --> 01:34:52.853
OF CRIPPLING THING THAT'S

01:34:52.920 --> 01:34:53.821
IMPORTANT BECAUSE THOSE ARE

01:34:53.888 --> 01:34:56.157
CARS OFF THE FREEWAY NEXT PLEASE

01:34:56.824 --> 01:34:59.527
SO -- ARE FAIRS COVER ABOUT

01:34:59.593 --> 01:35:01.662
FORTY FORTY FOUR PERCENT OF

01:35:01.729 --> 01:35:03.597
OUR OPERATING BUDGET THAT IS

01:35:03.664 --> 01:35:05.032
HIGHER THAN OTHER CARRIAGES OF

01:35:05.099 --> 01:35:06.567
THE CALIFORNIA BY SIGNIFICANT

01:35:06.634 --> 01:35:08.702
AMOUNT LA IS NOW I THINK ABOUT

01:35:08.769 --> 01:35:11.038
EIGHTEEN PERCENT WERE AT FORTY

01:35:11.539 --> 01:35:13.774
OF CELLS OF THE USERS ON

01:35:13.841 --> 01:35:16.243
METROLINK ARE PAYING A BIGGER

01:35:16.310 --> 01:35:17.578
PERCENTAGE OF THE FREIGHT RATE

01:35:17.778 --> 01:35:19.413
THAN THEY ARE OTHER BOYS IN

01:35:19.480 --> 01:35:20.681
AND RAIL SYSTEMS IN SOUTHERN

01:35:20.748 --> 01:35:23.350
CALIFORNIA NEXT NEXT SO IF WE

01:35:23.417 --> 01:35:25.519
IF WE THEN TAKE THOSE FINGERS

01:35:25.586 --> 01:35:27.288
TOGETHER ALONG ON THE LONG TRIPS

01:35:27.354 --> 01:35:29.023
IF THE HIGH PASSENGER MILES AND

01:35:29.090 --> 01:35:31.125
THE HIGH FAIRS WHAT WE SEE IS

01:35:31.358 --> 01:35:33.027
THERE'S A VERY LOW SUBSIDY PER

01:35:33.094 --> 01:35:34.428
PASSENGER MILE ON METAL LIKE

01:35:34.495 --> 01:35:35.596
MUCH ALIKE IS THE ORANGE ONE UP

01:35:35.663 --> 01:35:37.565
THERE ARE NOT QUITE AS AS LOW

01:35:37.631 --> 01:35:39.500
AS AN OLD VALLEY WHICH IS A LONG

01:35:39.567 --> 01:35:40.901
DISTANCE BUS CARRIER FROM AN

01:35:40.968 --> 01:35:42.770
OLD VALLEY DOWN TO LA BUT MUCH

01:35:42.837 --> 01:35:44.238
LOWER THAN OTHER SYSTEMS AROUND

01:35:44.305 --> 01:35:45.873
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IT CENTS

01:35:45.940 --> 01:35:48.175
GOODBYE NOW IF WE TAKE THAT

01:35:48.242 --> 01:35:49.977
NUMBER AND SUBTRACT FROM IT THE

01:35:50.044 --> 01:35:51.345
AMOUNT OF MONEY WHICH METROLINK

01:35:51.412 --> 01:35:53.347
GENERATES THE STATE AND FEDERAL

01:35:53.414 --> 01:35:54.715
FUNDS WHICH GO TO THE COUNTIES

01:35:55.049 --> 01:35:56.984
NEXT SLIDE PLACES WE COME OUT

01:35:57.051 --> 01:35:58.686
WITH THE NET NEUTRALITY SUBSIDY

01:35:58.986 --> 01:36:00.688
OR COST PER PASSENGER MILE

01:36:01.055 --> 01:36:03.757
ACOSTA LA METRO ABOUT TEN CENTS

01:36:03.991 --> 01:36:04.992
FOR EVERY PASSENGER MILE THAT

01:36:05.059 --> 01:36:06.827
OCCURS WITHIN LOS ANGELES COUNTY

01:36:07.795 --> 01:36:08.896
IN ORANGE IS A LITTLE LESS

01:36:08.963 --> 01:36:10.531
THAN THAT YOU SEE SAM READY ON

01:36:10.931 --> 01:36:13.300
RIVERSIDE AFFAIRS WELL MENTOR

01:36:13.367 --> 01:36:14.201
MENTOR IS A LITTLE BIT HIGHER

01:36:14.268 --> 01:36:15.603
THIRTY CENTS PER PASSENGER MILE

01:36:16.003 --> 01:36:17.571
BUT EVEN THEN THAT IS VERY CHEAP

01:36:17.638 --> 01:36:20.040
COMPARED TO OTHER TRANSIT

01:36:20.107 --> 01:36:22.243
SYSTEMS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA NEXT

01:36:22.309 --> 01:36:24.111
PLEASE THEN IF WE LOOK AT THE

01:36:24.178 --> 01:36:26.447
FACT THAT UNLIKE LIKE ALL SPEAK

01:36:26.514 --> 01:36:27.748
THE ORANGE COUNTY METRO WHERE I

01:36:27.815 --> 01:36:29.617
WORKED MAJORITY THE WRITERS ARE

01:36:29.683 --> 01:36:31.585
LOW INCOME TRANSIT PENANCE GOD

01:36:31.652 --> 01:36:33.120
BLESS WHAT'S GOING TO WORK OR

01:36:33.187 --> 01:36:35.022
THEY'RE GOING TO SCHOOL MANY OF

01:36:35.089 --> 01:36:36.891
THEM MOST ON PERHAPS OUR TRANSIT

01:36:36.957 --> 01:36:39.059
ATTENDANCE THEY DON'T HAVE CARS

01:36:39.293 --> 01:36:40.761
MAJORITY ELECTRONIC WRITERS

01:36:40.828 --> 01:36:43.264
HOWEVER DO HAVE CARS EIGHTY MORE

01:36:43.330 --> 01:36:44.265
THAN EIGHTY PERCENT OF THEM HAVE

01:36:44.331 --> 01:36:46.167
AN AUTOMOBILE WHAT THAT MEANS IS

01:36:46.233 --> 01:36:48.002
THEY ARE DISCRETIONARY WRITERS

01:36:48.068 --> 01:36:49.203
THEY CAN TAKE THE FREEWAY IF

01:36:49.270 --> 01:36:50.671
THEY WANT TO BUT THEY PREFER

01:36:50.738 --> 01:36:52.206
TO TAKE METROLINK WHICH IS A

01:36:52.273 --> 01:36:53.607
BLESSING TO THOSE PEOPLE WHO

01:36:53.674 --> 01:36:55.843
ARE ON THE FREEWAY -- NEXT

01:36:55.910 --> 01:36:58.345
PLEASE SO WHAT IS THE MAP AGAIN

01:36:58.412 --> 01:36:59.847
AGAIN SO WHAT HAPPENS YET THIS

01:36:59.914 --> 01:37:00.981
IS MICHAEL MICHAEL REPRESENTS

01:37:01.048 --> 01:37:02.816
A VERY LOW COST OPPORTUNITY

01:37:03.050 --> 01:37:04.718
TO REALLY FREEWAYS CRITICALLY

01:37:04.785 --> 01:37:05.619
IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE HAVE A

01:37:05.686 --> 01:37:06.787
FIXED COMPASSIONATE FREEWAY

01:37:06.854 --> 01:37:08.589
SYSTEM WITH INCREASING DEMAND

01:37:08.656 --> 01:37:10.558
AND FUTURE NEXT ELECTIONS

01:37:10.824 --> 01:37:12.293
AT SIX OH THIS IS JUST A FEW

01:37:12.359 --> 01:37:13.360
THINGS HERE THIS IS ANNABELLE

01:37:13.427 --> 01:37:15.329
WE ALREADY DISCUSSED AT THE FARE

01:37:15.396 --> 01:37:16.730
INCREASE OUR THE FAIR CUT THEM

01:37:16.797 --> 01:37:18.532
TO WRITE A SHORT CLOSE NEXT NEXT

01:37:18.999 --> 01:37:20.000
IN HERE WE'RE GONNA SEE WE HOPE

01:37:20.067 --> 01:37:21.068
TO SEE THE SAME THING ON A SAM

01:37:21.135 --> 01:37:22.903
READING ONLINE LINE NEXT NEXT

01:37:24.605 --> 01:37:25.773
DOES JUST STATION ONCE BY THE

01:37:25.839 --> 01:37:26.774
WAY YOU CAN SEE WE HAVE A LOT OF

01:37:26.840 --> 01:37:29.109

THE NATURE OF THE STUDY A

01:40:50.110 --> 01:40:51.545
HIGH LEVEL OF PLANNING STUDY

01:40:51.745 --> 01:40:54.581
OUR AIM WAS NOT TO RECOMMEND

ALTERNATIVES OR PARTICULAR MODE

01:40:58.986 --> 01:41:00.687
NOT APPROPRIATE TO DO SO AT THIS

01:41:00.754 --> 01:41:02.689
LEVEL BUT WE DID GET A LOT OF

01:41:02.756 --> 01:41:04.191
INFORMATION OUT OF THE STUDY

01:41:04.258 --> 01:41:06.460
WE DID RIDERSHIP FORECASTING

01:41:06.693 --> 01:41:08.295
OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE

01:41:08.362 --> 01:41:09.663
COSTS FOR THE FUTURE AFTER

01:41:09.730 --> 01:41:12.332
TWENTY FORTY -- CAPITAL COSTS

01:41:13.801 --> 01:41:15.969
-- NEXT PLEASE LEAVE WE

01:41:16.036 --> 01:41:17.438
HAD A LOT OF PUBLIC OUTREACH

01:41:17.504 --> 01:41:19.440
-- IN THIS IN THIS STUDY STUDY

01:41:19.506 --> 01:41:22.009
AREA -- WE HAD REPRESENTATIVES

01:41:22.075 --> 01:41:24.011
FROM THE SEVEN CITIES FROM

01:41:24.077 --> 01:41:26.246
CAL TRANS -- TO DISTRICT SIX

01:41:26.313 --> 01:41:28.849
SEVEN EIGHT EIGHT -- WE ALSO

01:41:28.916 --> 01:41:30.484
HAD A REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE

01:41:30.551 --> 01:41:32.519
OPERATORS METROLINK OMNITRANS

01:41:32.586 --> 01:41:35.022
FOOTHILL TRANSIT OF COURSE AS PC

01:41:35.088 --> 01:41:37.491
TA AND LA METRO AND WE

01:41:37.558 --> 01:41:39.927
HAD TWO ROUNDS OF OPEN HOUSES --

01:41:40.127 --> 01:41:42.062
DURING TWO SUMMERS AND A LOT

01:41:42.129 --> 01:41:44.364
OF STAKEHOLDER INTERVIEWS NEXT

01:41:44.431 --> 01:41:47.334
PLEASE SO WE DID A TRAVEL

01:41:47.401 --> 01:41:49.670
MARKET ANALYSIS OF FIRST BEFORE

01:41:49.736 --> 01:41:50.671
WE STARTED WORKING ON THE

01:41:50.737 --> 01:41:53.407
ALTERNATIVES AND WE FOUND THAT

01:41:53.707 --> 01:41:55.509
-- THERE ARE ONE POINT ONE

01:41:55.576 --> 01:41:57.878
MILLION TRIPS ENTER OR LEAVE

01:41:57.945 --> 01:42:00.214
THE STUDY AREA WE ALSO

01:42:00.280 --> 01:42:01.348
FOUND THAT THERE'S ONE POINT

01:42:01.415 --> 01:42:03.050
SEVEN MILLION TRIPS WITHIN

01:42:03.116 --> 01:42:05.118
THE STUDY AREA SO THAT'S A LOT

01:42:05.686 --> 01:42:07.688
AND THEN YOU NOTICE INVESTMENTS

01:42:07.754 --> 01:42:08.889
IN THE PLANNING WAS A LOT OF

01:42:08.956 --> 01:42:10.691
USE WAS SERVICES BUT WE FOUND

01:42:10.757 --> 01:42:11.959
THAT THERE'S A VERY WHAT WE

01:42:12.025 --> 01:42:14.061
CALL POLICY CENTRIC CREEK TRAVEL

01:42:14.127 --> 01:42:16.163
PATTERN AS IN THIS AREA OF

01:42:16.230 --> 01:42:18.098
PEOPLE ARE GOING ON DIAGONALLY

01:42:18.165 --> 01:42:20.434
NORTH SOUTHEAST WEST AND IF

01:42:20.501 --> 01:42:21.568
YOU LOOK AT THE NORTH SOUTH

01:42:21.635 --> 01:42:23.871
SOUTH OF US SERVICES IN THE

01:42:23.937 --> 01:42:25.506
STUDY AREA THE FREQUENCY OF

01:42:25.572 --> 01:42:27.574
THEM WAS MUCH LESS THAN THE EAST

01:42:27.641 --> 01:42:28.809
WEST SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT

01:42:28.876 --> 01:42:30.711
WE WERE THAT WE WERE LOOKING AT

01:42:31.178 --> 01:42:32.479
-- AND THEN AND THEN THAT WERE

01:42:32.546 --> 01:42:33.614
RIGHT IN THE HEART OF OUR TOP

01:42:33.680 --> 01:42:36.049
CITY FARES -- WE HAVE RANCHO

01:42:36.116 --> 01:42:37.985

01:42:38.051 --> 01:42:40.120
UPLAND IN UPLAND SURROUND TRADE

01:42:40.187 --> 01:42:41.655
WITH THE TOP THREE CITY PAIRS OF

01:42:41.722 --> 01:42:44.057
THOSE SEVEN CITIES IN OUR STUDY

01:42:44.124 --> 01:42:46.193
AREA AREA NEXT PLEASE PLEASE

01:42:47.394 --> 01:42:49.229
SO DID TO PHASE IN SCREENING

01:42:49.296 --> 01:42:51.365
-- PHASE ONE PHASE TWO PHASE

01:42:51.431 --> 01:42:53.767
ONE WAS VERY HIGH LEVEL THIRTY

01:42:53.834 --> 01:42:55.002
EIGHT ALTERNATIVES BASED ON

01:42:55.068 --> 01:42:56.503
PREVIOUS STUDY AS THE TRAVEL

01:42:56.570 --> 01:42:59.306
MARKET ANALYSIS WE DID --

01:42:59.540 --> 01:43:01.241
THERE'S SOME OF THE CRITERIA

01:43:01.308 --> 01:43:03.110
THAT WE USE TRAVEL TIME TRANSFER

01:43:03.176 --> 01:43:05.646
TIME NUMBER OF TRANSFERS MILES

01:43:05.712 --> 01:43:07.748
OF NEW INFRASTRUCTURE MOSTLY FOR

01:43:07.814 --> 01:43:10.784
RAIL AND THEN WE CAME UP BASED

01:43:10.851 --> 01:43:12.419
ON THAT WITH THE FOR BUILD

01:43:12.486 --> 01:43:14.221
ALTERNATIVES OF WEEKLY PACKAGE

01:43:14.288 --> 01:43:17.057
MORTALLY -- AND WE ALSO HAVE

01:43:17.124 --> 01:43:19.026
A NO BUILD ALTERNATIVE WHICH

01:43:19.092 --> 01:43:20.961
IS NORMAL A TRANSPORTATION

01:43:21.028 --> 01:43:22.429
SYSTEMS MANAGEMENT ALTERNATIVE

01:43:22.496 --> 01:43:23.764
WHICH IS NORMAL IN THE FOR

01:43:23.830 --> 01:43:25.966
BUILD ALTERNATIVES AND AGAIN

01:43:26.033 --> 01:43:27.434
WE DID -- MORE ROBERT MUCH

01:43:27.501 --> 01:43:29.236
MORE ROBUST ANALYSIS FOR

01:43:29.303 --> 01:43:30.737
THE PHASE TWO NEXT PLEASE

01:43:31.972 --> 01:43:33.440
SO HERE WE ARE PACKING IDEA

01:51:44.464 --> 01:51:46.166
ONTARIO EITHER DIDN'T HAVE

01:51:46.399 --> 01:51:47.734
THE FLIGHTS AVAILABLE OR THEY

01:51:47.801 --> 01:51:49.536
WERE TOO EXPENSIVE AND THAT

01:51:49.602 --> 01:51:51.037
WAS REALLY OUR PRIMARY FACTOR

01:51:51.104 --> 01:51:52.672
THAT WE WANTED TO ESTABLISH

01:51:52.739 --> 01:51:54.074
AND WE'VE BEEN SUCCESSFUL BOTH

01:51:54.140 --> 01:51:55.108
WITH THE INCREASED AMOUNT OF

01:51:55.175 --> 01:51:57.143
IRAQ NONSTOP FLIGHT AND WE'VE

01:51:57.210 --> 01:51:58.445
LOWERED THE FEARS ALMOST ALL

01:51:58.511 --> 01:52:00.547
THE DESTINATIONS THAT WE FLY

01:52:00.613 --> 01:52:02.482
TO SO I THINK IT IS MUCH MORE

01:52:02.549 --> 01:52:04.551
ACCOMMODATING FOR ALL THE FOLKS

01:52:04.617 --> 01:52:06.519
REGION -- THEY DON'T NEED TO

01:52:06.586 --> 01:52:08.254
MAKE THAT DRIVE TO LOS ANGELES

01:52:08.488 --> 01:52:09.789
I HAVE A LOT OF FRIENDS WE WORK

01:52:09.856 --> 01:52:11.057
TOGETHER WITH THE COMMUNITIES

01:52:11.124 --> 01:52:12.025
RUN ELLIE ACTION THEY'RE

01:52:12.092 --> 01:52:13.526
EXTREMELY HAPPY THAT I TRAILS

01:52:13.593 --> 01:52:15.528
SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE IT RELIEVING

01:52:15.595 --> 01:52:17.864
A LOT OF THE REJECTION AN IMPACT

01:52:18.131 --> 01:52:19.466
TO CITIES LIKE MICHAEL WOULDN'T

01:52:19.532 --> 01:52:21.868
ALSO GONE DOWN -- ON THIS GAG

01:52:21.935 --> 01:52:23.369
STANDPOINT I DO WANT TO MENTION

01:52:23.436 --> 01:52:24.804
THAT THAT I'VE ESTABLISHED IN

01:52:24.871 --> 01:52:26.272

TEN DOLLARS FOR FIVE DOLLAR

01:57:45.458 --> 01:57:47.427

I'M SO GLAD THAT THEY HAVE

02:05:48.607 --> 02:05:51.477
INCREASED THEIR MINIMUM WAGE

02:05:51.744 --> 02:05:54.246

THAT WE HAVE TO FIND THE BALANCE

02:06:29.214 --> 02:06:31.250
BECAUSE WE HAVE TOO MANY TOO

02:06:31.317 --> 02:06:32.851
MANY PEOPLE WITHOUT TOO MANY

02:06:32.918 --> 02:06:34.320

-- THE LOGISTICS INDUSTRY WERE

02:06:45.064 --> 02:06:46.932
KNOWN AS THE HUB BUT WITH HALF

02:06:46.999 --> 02:06:49.568
A MILLION SQUARE FEET OF OF

02:06:49.768 --> 02:06:52.237

SELLS SELLS ITS ITS THE DIESEL

02:06:58.110 --> 02:06:59.645
TRUCKS COMING IN AND WHAT IT

02:06:59.712 --> 02:07:01.380
DOES TO THE COMMUNITY WHERE

02:07:01.447 --> 02:07:02.948
DO YOU FIND THAT BALANCE HOW

02:07:03.015 --> 02:07:04.750
WHAT WHERE DO WE NEED TO GO TO

02:07:04.817 --> 02:07:07.219

FIVE YEARS IN THIS REGION AND

02:07:14.026 --> 02:07:15.427
SO MY GRAND GRANDFATHER WORKED

02:07:15.494 --> 02:07:17.196
IN ORANGE ORANGE GROVES RIGHT

02:07:17.663 --> 02:07:20.933
-- I THINK WORK IS IMPORTANT

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:22.901
OKAY AND UNFORTUNATELY WHILE

02:07:22.968 --> 02:07:24.069
WE'RE NUMBER ONE IN ONE JOB

02:07:24.136 --> 02:07:25.804
GROWTH THE LAST FIVE YEARS --

02:07:25.871 --> 02:07:27.439
WE'RE STILL OF METRO REGIONS

02:07:27.506 --> 02:07:29.041
OVER MILLION THE ONE THAT HAS

02:07:29.108 --> 02:07:30.743
THE LOWEST BACK WORRIED AT

02:07:30.809 --> 02:07:33.345
TWENTY ONE PERCENT AND SO JOBS

02:07:34.079 --> 02:07:35.948
THAT DON'T HAVE A HIGH THRESHOLD

02:07:36.015 --> 02:07:38.017
FOR EDUCATION ARE SOMETHING

02:07:38.083 --> 02:07:39.284
THAT WE NEED IN ORDER FOR PEOPLE

02:07:39.351 --> 02:07:41.553
JUST TO GET ALONG AND I ALSO

02:07:41.620 --> 02:07:43.889
AS YOU KNOW WE WORRY ABOUT

02:07:44.456 --> 02:07:46.458
THE GOING RATE OF POVERTY --

02:07:46.525 --> 02:07:48.260
UNEMPLOYMENT UNDEREMPLOYMENT

02:07:48.327 --> 02:07:50.195
AND ALL OF THE SOCIAL ILLS THAT

02:07:50.262 --> 02:07:52.398
COME WITH THAT -- -- BRIDGING

02:07:52.464 --> 02:07:54.700
REACT TO WHAT I WHEN I WAS

02:07:54.767 --> 02:07:56.402
I WAS TALKING ABOUT -- WITH

02:07:56.468 --> 02:07:57.836
OPPORTUNITIES OF COURSE THE

02:07:57.903 --> 02:07:59.538
CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD

02:07:59.972 --> 02:08:02.674
I THINK I I I UNDERSTAND

02:08:02.741 --> 02:08:05.077
-- FROM ROOM I WAS JUST IN

02:08:05.144 --> 02:08:06.612
ATLANTA AT THE COCA COLA

02:08:06.678 --> 02:08:08.247

LAST WAS WELL LAST WEEK --

02:08:12.384 --> 02:08:14.386
THERE'S A HUGE DESIRE TO MAKE

02:08:14.453 --> 02:08:16.188
-- THEIR FLEETS AS CLEAN AS

02:08:16.255 --> 02:08:18.424
TECHNICAL AS POSSIBLE -- SO I

02:08:18.490 --> 02:08:19.725
THINK WE NEED TO WORK TOGETHER

02:08:19.792 --> 02:08:21.827
WE NEED TO INCENTIVIZE --

02:08:21.894 --> 02:08:23.462
WE NEED TO STUDY BECAUSE IN

02:08:23.529 --> 02:08:25.864
SOME CASES THE TECHNOLOGY

02:08:25.931 --> 02:08:28.200
ISN'T THERE YET -- BUT BUT

02:08:28.267 --> 02:08:30.235
THAT'S THAT'S MY HOPE IS FOR

02:08:30.469 --> 02:08:32.938
-- A DISCUSSION AND PEOPLE TO

02:08:33.005 --> 02:08:34.406
REALLY COME TOGETHER NOT JUST

02:08:34.473 --> 02:08:35.741
RUN TO YOUR CORNERS AND YELL

02:08:35.808 --> 02:08:37.609
AT EACH OTHER -- BECAUSE THAT'S

02:08:37.676 --> 02:08:38.777
NOT GOING TO ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING

02:08:38.844 --> 02:08:40.679
FOR EITHER SIDE WE REALLY NEED

02:08:40.746 --> 02:08:42.314
TO COME TOGETHER AND FIND WAYS

02:08:42.681 --> 02:08:44.416
TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS

02:08:44.483 --> 02:08:45.918
ORDER SO THOSE TECHNOLOGIES

02:08:45.984 --> 02:08:47.886
WHERE THEIR TRUCKS -- WHETHER

02:08:47.953 --> 02:08:48.987
THEY'RE WITHIN THE WAREHOUSE

02:08:49.054 --> 02:08:51.090
HOUSE AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT

02:08:52.624 --> 02:08:54.226
ACCORDING TO A STUDY OUT OF

02:08:54.293 --> 02:08:56.061
UNIVERSITY OF REDLANDS SIXTY

02:08:56.128 --> 02:08:58.063
PERCENT OF OUR JOB AND IT'S

02:08:58.130 --> 02:08:59.198
NOT JUST THE WAREHOUSE HOUSE

02:08:59.264 --> 02:09:00.632
IT'S THE OPHTHALMOLOGIST IT'S

ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO AUTOMATION

02:09:05.537 --> 02:09:07.272
AGE -- AND SO THAT'S ANOTHER

02:09:07.339 --> 02:09:08.974
PRESSURE THAT WE FEEL AND

02:09:09.041 --> 02:09:09.908
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO BE PAYING

02:09:09.975 --> 02:09:11.710
ATTENTION TO AS WELL WELL WELL

WE WANT THEM TO STAY HEALTHY

02:09:29.094 --> 02:09:30.329
BECAUSE IN THE END WE WILL

02:09:30.395 --> 02:09:32.564
SPEND SO MUCH MORE IF WE'RE

02:09:32.631 --> 02:09:33.799

FOR DOCTOR WILL ALSO

02:09:47.212 --> 02:09:48.347
THE DOCTOR WILL SIT ON

02:09:48.413 --> 02:09:50.816
THE QUESTION WAS OUT OF --

02:09:51.917 --> 02:09:54.086
AND THE GENTLEMAN ONE OF

02:09:54.153 --> 02:09:56.155
THE OTHER PRESENTERS OR --

02:09:56.355 --> 02:09:58.056
SPECIFICALLY ABOUT GOLDLINE

02:09:58.123 --> 02:10:00.459
LINE AS YOU KNOW I REPRESENTING

02:10:00.526 --> 02:10:01.927
THE DISTRICT FORTY OR DISTRICT

02:10:01.994 --> 02:10:03.395
FORTY SEVEN WHICH BEGINS AT

02:10:03.462 --> 02:10:06.165
FONTANA AND THAT I WANT

02:10:06.231 --> 02:10:08.500
TO KNOW -- I AM CONCERNED

02:10:08.567 --> 02:10:11.170
ABOUT ADDITIONAL IMPACT --

02:10:11.803 --> 02:10:12.804
BECAUSE THEY COULD REDUCE

02:10:12.871 --> 02:10:14.506
SERVICE SERVICE TO THE VERY

02:10:14.573 --> 02:10:16.175
PEOPLE THAT I REPRESENT SENT

02:10:16.475 --> 02:10:18.744
OUT I WANT TO KNOW WHAT WILL

YOU AS SPC TA DO TO PROTECT

02:10:21.613 --> 02:10:22.981
TRANSIT A TRANSIT AS IT

02:10:23.048 --> 02:10:25.817
AVAILABILITY IN MY DISTRICT

02:10:26.351 --> 02:10:28.520
I THINK HERE CONCERN IS THE

02:10:28.587 --> 02:10:30.856
DIFFERENCE AND FAIRS IN THE

02:10:30.923 --> 02:10:32.824
TWO SYSTEMS YOU SHOULD BE VERY

02:10:32.891 --> 02:10:34.726
CONCERNED ABOUT THAT -- A ONE

02:10:34.793 --> 02:10:37.229
WAY TRIP FOR ON THE GOLD LINE

02:10:38.096 --> 02:10:39.398
EXAMPLE WHEN IT GETS TO COME ON

02:10:39.464 --> 02:10:41.166
A NORTH IS A DOLLAR SEVENTY FIVE

02:10:41.233 --> 02:10:43.468
TWO EVERYWHERE METRO SERVERS SO

02:10:43.535 --> 02:10:46.238
YOU GO TO LONG BEACH A ONE WAY

02:10:46.305 --> 02:10:48.774
TRIP ON THE METRO LIKE SYSTEM TO

02:10:48.840 --> 02:10:51.710
UNION STATION WITH THE CURRENT

02:10:51.777 --> 02:10:53.212
TWENTY FIVE PERCENT TEMPORARY

02:10:53.278 --> 02:10:55.647
FAIR REDUCTION IS SIX DOLLARS

02:10:55.714 --> 02:10:56.982
AND SEVENTY FIVE CENTS SO IT'S

02:10:57.049 --> 02:10:59.051
A FIVE DOLLAR DIFFERENCE IT

02:10:59.117 --> 02:10:59.918
DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE GOAL

02:10:59.985 --> 02:11:02.154
LINE SERVICE CHEAPER IT MEANS

02:11:02.221 --> 02:11:03.555
THAT IT'S BEING SUBSIDIZED

02:11:03.622 --> 02:11:05.591
SIGNIFICANTLY MORE HEAVILY BUT

02:11:05.657 --> 02:11:07.025
THE CONCERN AND WE HAVE AND

02:11:07.092 --> 02:11:09.194
WE'VE EXPRESSED AND IN NUMEROUS

02:11:09.261 --> 02:11:11.563
VENUES IS THAT WHEN WE'VE

02:11:11.630 --> 02:11:13.165
ALREADY SEEN WE'VE GOT THAT

02:11:13.365 --> 02:11:15.601
WE'VE GOT EVIDENCE THAT THE GOLD

02:11:15.667 --> 02:11:17.502
LINE CURRENTLY THE TERMINUS IN

02:11:17.569 --> 02:11:20.305
IS USE -- IS DRAWING PASSENGERS

02:11:20.372 --> 02:11:21.506
OFFER THE METROLINK SYSTEM

02:11:21.573 --> 02:11:23.242
BECAUSE OF THAT -- SUBSIDY

02:11:23.308 --> 02:11:24.509
DIFFERENTIAL ON THE AND THE

02:11:24.576 --> 02:11:26.745
FARE DIFFERENTIAL -- TO THE TUNE

02:11:26.812 --> 02:11:28.013
OF ABOUT TWENTY FIVE PERCENT

02:11:28.847 --> 02:11:30.716
WHEN IN THE GOAL LINE CONVERGES

02:11:30.782 --> 02:11:32.618
INTO THE METROLINK CORRIDOR OR

02:11:32.684 --> 02:11:34.119
WHETHER IT STOPS MONNING NORTH

02:11:34.186 --> 02:11:35.988
-- CONTINUES EAST TO MONTCLAIR

02:11:36.355 --> 02:11:38.590
CLEARLY WHEN YOU HAVE THE CHOICE

02:11:38.657 --> 02:11:40.626
TO PAY A DOLLAR SEVENTY FIVE

02:11:40.959 --> 02:11:42.794
SIX SEVENTY FIVE EIGHT DOLLARS

02:11:42.861 --> 02:11:44.029
OR WHATEVER IT IS YOU HAD

02:11:44.096 --> 02:11:46.265
FURTHER EAST ITS PROBLEM BECAUSE

02:11:46.331 --> 02:11:48.100
MOST OF US DOESN'T MATTER OUR

02:11:48.166 --> 02:11:49.568
FINANCIAL STATUS AGAIN AND

02:11:49.635 --> 02:11:51.236
MAKE THE CHOICE THE CHEAPER

02:11:51.570 --> 02:11:52.804
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU CONSIDER AND

02:11:52.871 --> 02:11:55.007
LEAVES ANALYZE THE THE SERVICES

02:11:55.474 --> 02:11:57.175
THE THE TIME DIFFERENTIAL

02:11:57.242 --> 02:11:58.310
TO TAKE THE GOAL LINE THREE

02:11:58.377 --> 02:12:01.113
PASADENA DOWN INTO ELIAN

02:12:01.179 --> 02:12:03.682
STATION IS INCONSEQUENTIAL IT'S

02:12:03.749 --> 02:12:05.083
YOU KNOW THE TUNE OF OF FIVE OR

02:12:05.150 --> 02:12:07.185
SIX MINUTES DIFFERENCE IN TIME

02:12:07.252 --> 02:12:08.387
SO IT'S A HUGE PROBLEM REALLY

02:12:08.453 --> 02:12:10.188
BEEN WORKING WITH LA METRO

02:12:10.689 --> 02:12:12.858
-- A SOLUTION AND AND IT'S

02:12:12.924 --> 02:12:14.760
CERTAINLY NOT A DECISION OF

02:12:14.826 --> 02:12:16.094
DECEMBER YOU KNOW COUNTY BUT A

02:12:16.161 --> 02:12:18.764
SOLUTION IS TO TAKE STEPS TO

02:12:18.964 --> 02:12:21.967
RECOGNIZE THAT -- YOU NEED

02:12:22.034 --> 02:12:24.636
DISTANCE BASED FARES ON THE

02:12:24.703 --> 02:12:26.538
THE -- THE GOAL LINE SYSTEM

02:12:26.605 --> 02:12:28.607
AND AND IN GENERAL ON THE THE

02:12:28.674 --> 02:12:30.609
METROLINK SYSTEMS A METRO SYSTEM

02:12:30.676 --> 02:12:32.644
AS IT'S EXPANDING THROUGHOUT LA

02:12:32.711 --> 02:12:34.813
COUNTY BUT AGAIN THAT'S NOT A

02:12:34.880 --> 02:12:37.149
DECISION THAT THAT WE CAN CAN

02:12:37.215 --> 02:12:39.318
INTERFERE WITH SO WE'RE VERY

02:12:39.384 --> 02:12:41.720
CONCERNED DOWNEY THAT THERE

02:12:41.787 --> 02:12:43.588
COULD BE A SIGNIFICANT LOSS

02:12:43.655 --> 02:12:45.223
RIDERSHIP BECAUSE OF THAT FARE

02:12:45.290 --> 02:12:47.926
DIFFERENTIAL AND WE DON'T HAVE

02:12:47.993 --> 02:12:49.328
THE ABILITY THROUGH OUR LOCAL

02:12:49.394 --> 02:12:52.331
SALES TAX MEASURE TO COVER

02:12:52.397 --> 02:12:53.765
THE INCREASED SUBSIDIES NEED

02:12:53.832 --> 02:12:55.767
SO THIS COULD TRANSLATE TO

02:12:55.834 --> 02:12:57.903
A REDUCED SERVICE EAST OF

02:12:57.969 --> 02:12:59.705
MONTCLAIR EAST MONO WHEREVER

02:12:59.771 --> 02:13:00.939
THEY TERMINATE THEIR FINAL

02:13:01.473 --> 02:13:02.774
SERVICE IT'S IT'S A REAL

02:13:02.841 --> 02:13:04.609
PROBLEM THAT WE'RE CONTINUING

02:13:04.676 --> 02:13:06.044
TO WORK WITH LA NATURAL AND

02:13:06.111 --> 02:13:07.612
AND TRYING TO FIND SOLUTIONS TO

02:13:08.580 --> 02:13:10.716
WELL TO COUNT ON US TO TO

02:13:10.782 --> 02:13:13.285
TO PARTNER WITH YOU YOU I THINK

02:13:13.352 --> 02:13:14.586
THAT -- AND THAT'S WHAT'S SO

02:13:14.653 --> 02:13:16.955
IMPORTANT TO ME TO HAVE A GOOD

02:13:17.022 --> 02:13:18.290
WORKING RELATIONSHIPS WITH

02:13:18.357 --> 02:13:21.059
SBC TA I EVERY TIME WE HAVE

02:13:21.259 --> 02:13:22.227
HAD THE OPPORTUNITY SPEAK

02:13:22.294 --> 02:13:23.762
ABOUT ANY OF THE ISSUES YOU'VE

02:13:23.829 --> 02:13:25.230
ALL BEEN VERY RESPONSIVE BUT

02:13:25.297 --> 02:13:27.099
THIS IS OF GREAT CONCERN THAT

02:13:27.165 --> 02:13:28.834
BECAUSE OF THE SUBSIDIZING

02:13:28.900 --> 02:13:30.902
OF THE THE THE GOLD LINE LIKE

02:13:30.969 --> 02:13:32.804
THAT IT IS TAKING AWAY FROM

02:13:32.871 --> 02:13:35.107
METROLINK AND THAT IS GOING

02:13:35.173 --> 02:13:37.242
TO HAVE AN IMPACT VERY SERIOUS

02:13:37.309 --> 02:13:39.511
IMPACT ON ON THE RIDERSHIP

02:13:39.578 --> 02:13:41.580
SHIP FROM FROM MY SPECIFIC AREA

02:13:42.147 --> 02:13:43.715
FROM THE EAST TO THE EASTERN

02:13:43.782 --> 02:13:45.317
PORTION OF SAN BERNARDINO

02:13:45.384 --> 02:13:46.685
COUNTY THAT'S A VERY GOOD

02:13:46.752 --> 02:13:47.586

02:13:57.462 --> 02:13:58.997
ALL THESE YEARS EVEN SCREW

02:13:59.064 --> 02:14:00.265
THAT UP I'M VERY SORRY

02:14:02.300 --> 02:14:03.735
I DID NOT KNOW SO I'M GLAD THAT

02:14:03.802 --> 02:14:06.104
I KNOW DOCTOR WILL MY QUESTION

02:14:08.340 --> 02:14:09.674
ARE THERE A LOT OF PROJECTS

02:14:09.741 --> 02:14:11.977
HAPPENING IN A LACY GABRIEL

02:14:12.043 --> 02:14:14.112
SAMBERG THE NOW -- WHAT DO YOU

02:14:14.179 --> 02:14:16.148
THINK IS THE BEST AN ACTIVITY

02:14:16.415 --> 02:14:18.483
TO LA COUNTY AND SAN MARINO

02:14:18.550 --> 02:14:19.985
COUNTY HOW HOW DO WE MAKE THAT

02:14:20.051 --> 02:14:22.120
HAPPEN FOR FOLKS TO ART TALKED

02:14:22.187 --> 02:14:23.889
ABOUT THE CONSTRAINTS THAT WE

02:14:23.955 --> 02:14:25.290
HAVE ON THE FREEWAY NETWORK AND

02:14:25.357 --> 02:14:26.958
CERTAINLY WE IN SAM'S YOU KNOW

02:14:27.025 --> 02:14:28.827
COUNTY OUR CONTINUING TO ADVANCE

02:14:28.894 --> 02:14:30.996
PROJECTS THIS THE -- LEAST

02:14:31.062 --> 02:14:32.964
ADDING LANES TO SOME OF THE

02:14:33.031 --> 02:14:35.934
KEY ARTERIALS BUT WE ARE

02:14:36.001 --> 02:14:38.170
VERY QUICKLY REACHING A POINT

02:14:38.236 --> 02:14:40.038
WHERE WE CAN'T CONTINUE TO ADD

02:14:40.105 --> 02:14:42.174
CAPACITY IS CERTAINLY IN THE

02:14:42.240 --> 02:14:44.009
GREATER LA BASIN INCLUDING THE

02:14:44.075 --> 02:14:45.911
SAN MARINO VALLEY IT'S VERY

02:14:45.977 --> 02:14:47.279
UNLIKELY THAT WILL EVER ADD A

02:14:47.345 --> 02:14:49.548
NEW FREEWAY FACILITY -- AND

02:14:49.614 --> 02:14:50.982
SO WITH THE POPULATION GROWTH

02:14:51.049 --> 02:14:52.684
THAT THAT ARE NOT -- COMMENTED

02:14:52.751 --> 02:14:54.786
ON WE'VE GOT TO FIND WAYS TO GET

02:14:54.853 --> 02:14:56.621
PEOPLE TO MAKE DIFFERENT CHOICES

02:14:56.955 --> 02:14:57.923
AND I THINK THE MOST EXCITING

02:14:57.989 --> 02:14:59.357
THING THAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW

02:14:59.791 --> 02:15:02.060
IS IS WHAT I MENTION AT THE END

02:15:02.127 --> 02:15:04.029
OF MY PRESENTATION IS LOOKING

02:15:04.095 --> 02:15:06.198
TO BRING ZERO EMISSION PASSENGER

02:15:06.264 --> 02:15:08.400
RAIL TECHNOLOGY THAT NOT ONLY

02:15:08.467 --> 02:15:10.669
BENEFITS A SHORT RAIL ROAD THAT

02:15:10.735 --> 02:15:11.770
WE'RE BUILDING IN THE EASTERN

02:15:11.837 --> 02:15:13.905
PART OF OUR COUNTY BUT REALLY

02:15:14.272 --> 02:15:16.608
HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BENEFIT

02:15:16.675 --> 02:15:18.043
THE ENTIRE METROLINK SYSTEM

02:15:18.109 --> 02:15:19.611
WHICH IS OVER FIVE HUNDRED MILES

02:15:19.811 --> 02:15:22.047
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY CHANGED

02:15:22.113 --> 02:15:23.715
THE LANDSCAPE OF PASSIONATE

02:15:23.782 --> 02:15:25.050
RAIL THROUGHOUT THIS COUNTRY

02:15:25.116 --> 02:15:26.151
AND THROUGHOUT NORTH AMERICA

02:15:26.218 --> 02:15:27.686
IT'S REALLY EXCITING TO TO

02:15:27.752 --> 02:15:30.055
HAVE THAT INCUBATED HERE IN

02:15:30.121 --> 02:15:31.623
SAM'S IF YOU KNOW COUNTY YET

02:15:31.690 --> 02:15:32.791
THAT'S A REALLY BIG DEAL IT'S

02:15:32.858 --> 02:15:34.326
VERY EXCITING WHAT MY OTHER

02:15:34.392 --> 02:15:35.694
QUESTION IS GOING TO BE WHAT

02:15:35.760 --> 02:15:37.429
ARE YOU WORKING ON TO CONTROL

02:15:37.496 --> 02:15:39.898
EMISSIONS THAT'S ONE A BIG ONE

02:15:40.165 --> 02:15:41.333
IS THERE ANY OTHER PROJECTS OR

02:15:41.399 --> 02:15:42.467
ARE THERE ANY OTHER PROJECTS

02:15:42.534 --> 02:15:43.368
THAT YOU'RE WORKING ON THAT

02:15:43.435 --> 02:15:44.870
WILL CONTROL EMISSIONS IN THE

02:15:44.936 --> 02:15:47.105
INLAND EMPIRE SO WE'VE PARTNERED

02:15:48.006 --> 02:15:50.642
THE LATELY IT'S A MANUFACTURER'S

02:15:50.709 --> 02:15:52.878
BATTERY TECHNOLOGIES ON A COUPLE

02:15:52.944 --> 02:15:54.346
OF PILOT PROJECTS ONE WITH

02:15:54.412 --> 02:15:55.814
WRITER THAT CONCLUDED A FEW

02:15:55.881 --> 02:15:58.149
YEARS AGO THAT -- LOOKED AT --

02:15:58.216 --> 02:16:00.619
PURCHASING -- BATTERY POWERED

02:16:00.685 --> 02:16:02.888
VEHICLES AND SMALLER SCALE AT

02:16:02.954 --> 02:16:04.189
THE TIME BECAUSE THE TECHNOLOGY

02:16:04.256 --> 02:16:05.857
WOULD ADVANCE TO THE POINT OF A

02:16:05.924 --> 02:16:08.226
VERY LARGE VEHICLES -- AND NOW

02:16:08.293 --> 02:16:09.628
WE'RE WORKING WITH THE LADY

02:16:09.694 --> 02:16:12.864
AGAIN AND -- THE SHORT HAUL

02:16:13.164 --> 02:16:15.534
FREIGHT RATE -- OF VEHICLES

02:16:15.600 --> 02:16:16.635
THAT ARE USED IN A MEMBER WHAT

02:16:16.701 --> 02:16:18.069
THEY CALL IN BUT THAT ARE USED

02:16:18.136 --> 02:16:20.305
IN THE -- INTERMODAL YARDS AND

02:16:20.372 --> 02:16:22.674
SO WE ARE YOU KNOW TRYING TO

02:16:23.074 --> 02:16:24.809
ADDRESS THE THE QUESTION IS

02:16:24.876 --> 02:16:27.245
ASSEMBLY MEMBER RADIUS ON HOW DO

02:16:27.312 --> 02:16:29.581
WE CONVERT THE VEHICLES THAT

02:16:29.648 --> 02:16:31.249
ARE USE THE GRADE SCHOOLS FOR

02:16:31.316 --> 02:16:33.084
EXAMPLE THAT ARE USED -- WERE

02:16:33.151 --> 02:16:34.753
NOT TO THE POINT YET YET AND

02:16:34.819 --> 02:16:36.988
-- ILAN MOSQUE DID ROLL OUT --

02:16:37.055 --> 02:16:39.424
LAST YEAR EARLIER THIS YEAR

02:16:39.491 --> 02:16:41.726
A -- A BATTERY POWERED SEMI

02:16:42.127 --> 02:16:43.929
TRACTOR TRAILER BUT WE'RE NOT

02:16:43.995 --> 02:16:45.263
QUITE TO THAT POINT WHERE THOSE

02:16:45.330 --> 02:16:46.698
VEHICLES I THINK ARE GOING TO

02:16:46.765 --> 02:16:48.300
INFILTRATE THE MARKET PLACE BUT

02:16:48.767 --> 02:16:50.635
AS A AS A COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS

02:16:50.702 --> 02:16:52.170
WERE VERY ACTIVE IN TRYING TO

02:16:52.237 --> 02:16:53.972
FIND SOLUTIONS THAT HELP TO

02:16:54.039 --> 02:16:55.974
ACCOMPLISH A MUCH HEALTHIER

02:16:56.041 --> 02:16:57.175

JUST A COMMENT FOR A MERE WALK

02:17:06.651 --> 02:17:08.119
THERE I LOVE ALL THE CHANGES

02:17:08.186 --> 02:17:09.387
THAT WERE SITTING AT THE AIRPORT

02:17:09.454 --> 02:17:10.889
THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THOSE OF

02:17:10.956 --> 02:17:12.223
US WHO WERE THERE TWICE A WEEK

WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE IT HAVE

02:17:14.392 --> 02:17:16.161
ONE LITTLE FAVOR DO YOU THINK

02:17:16.227 --> 02:17:18.063
YOU GUYS CAN RE PAVE THE PARKING

02:17:18.129 --> 02:17:20.699
LOT IT REALLY TEARS AT MY HEELS

02:17:22.701 --> 02:17:24.102
SO THIS IS A TOTALLY PERSONAL

02:17:25.704 --> 02:17:26.805
BUT THANK YOU IT'S WONDERFUL

02:17:26.871 --> 02:17:27.973
TO SEE THE TRANSFORMATION I

02:17:28.039 --> 02:17:29.107
TO REMEMBER WHEN WE USED TO

02:17:29.174 --> 02:17:31.009
PORT WALKING UP THE STAIRS OUT

02:17:31.343 --> 02:17:33.244
OUTSIDE -- AND I JUST WANT TO

02:17:33.311 --> 02:17:35.647
MAKE A COMMENT ABOUT AMAZON

02:17:36.014 --> 02:17:37.415
AND AND YOU KNOW THERE'S TWENTY

02:17:37.482 --> 02:17:39.017
THOUSAND EMPLOYEES BUT I THINK

02:17:39.084 --> 02:17:40.785
WHAT WE HAVE TO REMEMBER IS THAT

02:17:41.653 --> 02:17:43.154
OR THOUSAND OF THOSE JOBS ARE

02:17:43.221 --> 02:17:45.323
TEMPORARY PART TIME JOBS AND I

02:17:45.390 --> 02:17:47.359
KNEW THAT TWO YEARS AGO -- THE

02:17:47.425 --> 02:17:49.127
CITY OF SAN DINO HAD TO CUT TWO

02:17:49.194 --> 02:17:50.495
HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS

02:17:50.562 --> 02:17:52.330
THAT THEY USUALLY GIVE TO NON

02:17:52.397 --> 02:17:54.299
PROFITS SO THEY COULD RE PAVE

02:17:54.366 --> 02:17:55.500
THE STREETS BECAUSE THAT'S A

02:17:55.567 --> 02:17:58.003
LOT OF CARS COMING IN AND OUT SO

02:17:58.069 --> 02:17:59.504
WE JUST HAVE TO BE AWARE OF THAT

02:17:59.571 --> 02:18:01.206
I THINK IT'S GREAT THAT AMAZON

02:18:01.272 --> 02:18:03.008
HAS INCREASED THEIR MINIMUM WAGE

02:18:03.074 --> 02:18:05.143
TO FIFTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR BUT

02:18:05.343 --> 02:18:06.711
WE ALL KNOW THAT EVEN FIFTEEN

02:18:06.778 --> 02:18:07.979
DOLLARS AN HOUR IS NOT A LIVING

02:18:08.046 --> 02:18:10.348
WAGE MY TO MILLENNIALS THAT

02:18:10.415 --> 02:18:12.484

AND THIRTY DOLLARS FOR AN

02:18:19.290 --> 02:18:21.292
APARTMENT IN ONTARIO AND THEY

02:18:21.359 --> 02:18:22.560
BOTH HAVE VERY GOOD JOBS IN THE

02:18:22.627 --> 02:18:23.862
HEALTH PARTNERS THAT HAVE GOOD

02:18:23.928 --> 02:18:26.531
JOBS SO WE JUST HAVE TO REMEMBER

02:18:26.598 --> 02:18:27.832
THAT THE JOB SO WE'LL BRING IN

02:18:27.899 --> 02:18:29.300
TWENTY TWO PERCENT GROWTH WHILE

02:18:29.367 --> 02:18:31.569
THAT'S GREAT WHAT JOBS ARE WE

02:18:31.636 --> 02:18:33.905
BRINGING AND NOW WHERE I SIT AND

02:18:33.972 --> 02:18:36.508
WHERE WE SIT WHEN WE COMPANIES

02:18:36.574 --> 02:18:37.909
HAVE TO HAVE THEIR EMPLOYEES

02:18:37.976 --> 02:18:39.477
GO ON WELFARE OR COLLECT

02:18:39.544 --> 02:18:41.446
FOOD STAMPS THAT'S LESS MONEY

02:18:41.513 --> 02:18:44.149
THAT WE AS A GOVERNMENT CAN

02:18:44.215 --> 02:18:46.017
I USE FOR EDUCATION AND OTHER

02:18:46.084 --> 02:18:47.719
THINGS SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

02:18:47.786 --> 02:18:49.487
WE'LL BRING SUSTAINABLE JOBS

02:18:49.754 --> 02:18:51.690

EMPIRE TO SAM REGINO COUNTY

02:19:03.435 --> 02:19:05.070
RIVERSIDE COUNTY AND I THINK

02:19:05.136 --> 02:19:06.371
THAT'S THAT'S THE KIND OF VISION

02:19:06.438 --> 02:19:07.939
THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:19:08.006 --> 02:19:10.075
ALL THE ONLY JOBS THAT COME TO

02:19:10.942 --> 02:19:13.078
THE INLAND EMPIRE ARE NOT JUST

02:19:13.144 --> 02:19:14.379
WAREHOUSE JOBS BECAUSE THEY'RE

FOR THAT -- PEOPLE OF ALREADY

02:43:14.484 --> 02:43:16.286

02:43:16.353 --> 02:43:17.287
OF THINGS I THINK EVERYBODY'S

02:43:17.354 --> 02:43:19.122
TALKED ABOUT SP ONE PORTENT

02:43:19.489 --> 02:43:21.658
-- ITS IMPORTANCE -- I THINK

02:43:21.725 --> 02:43:22.726
THE IMPORTANT THING TO STRESS

02:43:22.792 --> 02:43:25.095
HERE IS THE SPLIT LIKE THAT

02:43:25.162 --> 02:43:26.563
OCCURRED WITH SP ONE BECAUSE A

02:43:26.630 --> 02:43:28.031
LOT OF LOCAL IS A COMBINATION OF

02:43:28.098 --> 02:43:30.433
LOCAL AND STATE FUNDING

02:43:30.500 --> 02:43:32.002
THAT GOES TO THAT THAT IT IS

ACTIVE -- AND THAT'S --

02:43:36.706 --> 02:43:37.941
IMPORTANT PIECE OF THIS IT

02:43:38.008 --> 02:43:39.376
CANNOT BE DIVERTED FOR ANY OTHER

02:43:39.442 --> 02:43:41.378
PURPOSE THESE ARE THE KEY THINGS

02:43:41.444 --> 02:43:42.812
THAT IT'S DOING IN LOS ANGELES

02:43:42.879 --> 02:43:44.381

-- WE TALKED ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE

02:44:09.239 --> 02:44:10.540
TALKED ABOUT PROP ONE BE IN TWO

02:44:10.607 --> 02:44:11.708
THOUSAND SIX WHERE THERE IS A

02:44:11.775 --> 02:44:14.244
ONE TIME INFUSION OF FUNDS FOR

02:44:14.311 --> 02:44:16.813

02:44:22.852 --> 02:44:25.222
IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF -- SP

02:44:25.288 --> 02:44:27.257
ONE WE KNOW THAT -- OBVIOUSLY

02:44:27.324 --> 02:44:29.159
PROP SIX IS A THREAT RIGHT IF

02:44:30.860 --> 02:44:32.662
LOT OF THE FUNDING MOST OF THE

02:44:32.729 --> 02:44:34.397
FUNDING FOR THIS GOES AWAY THERE

02:44:34.464 --> 02:44:36.333

BUT -- THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A

02:44:41.705 --> 02:44:43.173
SIGNIFICANT THREAT RIGHT WHAT

02:44:43.240 --> 02:44:44.841
WHILE WE SAY IS THERE'S ONE OF

02:44:44.908 --> 02:44:46.142

02:48:26.896 --> 02:48:27.997
AND THIS IS COMING THROUGH THE

02:48:28.064 --> 02:48:30.834
STABILISATION OF -- THAT STATE

02:48:30.900 --> 02:48:32.268
TRANSIT ASSISTANCE FUND WHICH

02:48:32.335 --> 02:48:34.304
HAS BEEN A HISTORICALLY VOLATILE

02:48:34.637 --> 02:48:36.272
SOURCE FOR TRANSIT AND THE STATE

02:48:36.339 --> 02:48:37.407
OF GOOD REPAIR PROGRAM WHICH

02:48:37.474 --> 02:48:39.876
IS FOCUSED ON A MAINTAINING

02:48:40.076 --> 02:48:41.644
THE EXISTING TRANSIT NETWORK

02:48:41.711 --> 02:48:44.047
AND THEN FINALLY -- THE ONE

02:48:44.113 --> 02:48:45.882
ONE FORMULA FOUND THAT SVC TA

02:48:45.949 --> 02:48:48.318
RECEIVES BECAUSE OF OUR MEASURE

02:48:48.384 --> 02:48:50.453
I TRANSPORTATION SALES TAXES

EXPECT TO RECEIVE AND IT'S

02:48:58.394 --> 02:49:01.197
IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT THIS

02:49:01.264 --> 02:49:03.533
WILL GROW WITH TIME BECAUSE WE

02:49:03.600 --> 02:49:05.435
HAVE DECIDED TO END ACCESS SALES

02:49:05.502 --> 02:49:08.004

IMPROVEMENT -- RECEIVED TWENTY

02:49:20.984 --> 02:49:22.218
ONE MIGHT MILLION DOLLARS OF

02:49:22.285 --> 02:49:23.520
COURSE THIS IS ONLY A PARTIAL

02:49:23.586 --> 02:49:25.321
YEAR ALLOCATION BUT THAT WAS A

02:49:25.388 --> 02:49:27.090
FIFTY PERCENT INCREASE IN THIS

02:49:27.156 --> 02:49:29.025
-- GAS TAX FUNDING OVER THE SAME

02:49:29.092 --> 02:49:31.027
PERIOD FOR THE LOCAL AGENCIES

PROJECTS FOR IMPROVEMENT AND

02:49:37.467 --> 02:49:38.468
IT'S IMPORTANT REMEMBER THAT A

LOT OF THESE PROJECTS ARE CITY

02:49:40.036 --> 02:49:41.905
WIDE MAINTENANCE PROJECTS SO

MANY MORE ROADS WILL ACTUALLY BE

02:49:43.673 --> 02:49:46.676
IMPACTED BY -- THIS FUNDING THAN

02:49:46.743 --> 02:49:49.012
IT APPEARS I LIKE I SAID THERE'S

02:49:49.078 --> 02:49:50.547
FIFTY NINE MILLION ESTIMATED

02:49:50.613 --> 02:49:51.948
TO BE RECEIVED AND THAT'S A

OUR SHARE OF STATEWIDE FUNDING

AND SIXTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS

02:51:06.689 --> 02:51:07.890
WHEN YOU FACTOR IN THE FORMULA

02:51:07.957 --> 02:51:10.827
ALLOCATIONS WE'VE MADE I STAFF

02:51:10.893 --> 02:51:12.061
IT HAS BEEN A CTA WENT THROUGH

02:51:12.128 --> 02:51:14.097
AN ASSIGNED AS LOW MEDIUM AND

02:51:14.163 --> 02:51:15.765
HIGH RISK TO EACH OF THESE

02:51:15.832 --> 02:51:16.966
PROJECTS THAT WERE AWARDED

02:51:17.033 --> 02:51:19.369

02:51:19.435 --> 02:51:21.070
THE PROJECTS ARE CLASSIFIED

02:51:21.137 --> 02:51:23.339
AS LOW RISK THESE PROJECTS

HAVE EITHER BEEN EXPRESSED AS

02:51:25.808 --> 02:51:27.477

THE CASE OF OR A TEN EXPRESS

02:51:36.119 --> 02:51:37.053
LANES PROJECT WE'VE ALREADY

02:51:37.120 --> 02:51:38.454
AWARDED A CONTRACT A LOT OF

02:51:38.521 --> 02:51:39.789
THE MONEY COMES FROM ACTUALLY

02:51:39.856 --> 02:51:41.858
FROM A FEDERAL SOURCE OUT OF AN

02:51:41.924 --> 02:51:43.793
SP ONE PROGRAM SO WE FEEL THAT

02:51:45.094 --> 02:51:46.462
HE'S MEDIUM RISK PROJECT

02:51:47.096 --> 02:51:48.431
-- WE'VE ASSIGNED A MEDIUM

02:51:48.498 --> 02:51:50.533

THOSE -- PROJECTS THE FUNDING

02:52:01.544 --> 02:52:02.412
COULD STAY AROUND FOR THOSE

02:52:02.478 --> 02:52:03.746
PROJECTS AND THEN HIGH RISK

02:52:03.813 --> 02:52:05.148
PROJECTS ARE THOSE WITH THE

BULK OF FUNDING IS PROGRAMMED

02:52:07.216 --> 02:52:08.985
AND THE OUTER YEARS SO WE

02:52:09.052 --> 02:52:10.186
KNOW THE REVENUE HASN'T BEEN

02:52:10.253 --> 02:52:11.754
COLLECTED YET YET FOR THOSE

02:52:11.821 --> 02:52:13.990
PROJECTS AND THE OTHER ONE

02:52:14.057 --> 02:52:15.358
TO GRADE SEPARATION HAS BEEN

02:52:15.425 --> 02:52:17.160
MENTIONED SEVERAL TIMES TODAY

02:52:17.460 --> 02:52:19.128
WE ASSIGN THAT AS A HIGH RISK

02:52:19.195 --> 02:52:20.797
PROJECT JUST BECAUSE THE PROJECT

02:52:21.631 --> 02:52:22.765
IS PROGRAMMED OUT IN LATER

02:52:22.832 --> 02:52:25.234
YEARS AND IT'S COMING FROM

02:52:26.636 --> 02:52:28.204
PROGRAM RIGHT NOW AND LATER

02:52:28.271 --> 02:52:29.639
FOR STATE FUNDS FROM MUST BE

02:52:29.706 --> 02:52:31.240
ONE THAT COULD BE BACK BACK

02:52:31.307 --> 02:52:32.642
FILLED WITH FEDERAL THAT'S

02:52:32.709 --> 02:52:34.010

FOR THE REGION WE ALL LIVE

02:54:43.206 --> 02:54:44.540
UNDER THE SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY

STRATEGIES AND THE REQUIREMENTS

02:54:46.542 --> 02:54:47.577
OF THE REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION

02:54:47.643 --> 02:54:49.478
PLAN TO REDUCE EMISSIONS AND

02:54:49.545 --> 02:54:51.147

FOR US IN A LOS ANGELES COUNTY

02:55:15.504 --> 02:55:17.707

THE EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS IN

OUR REGIONS SO THE SP ONE FUNDS

02:55:23.613 --> 02:55:25.414
ARE CRITICAL TO THAT -- WE

02:55:25.481 --> 02:55:26.649
HAVE A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT

02:55:26.716 --> 02:55:28.951
FROM OUR LOCAL SALES TAXES BUT

02:55:29.018 --> 02:55:30.353
THOSE LOCAL SALES TAXES RELY

02:55:31.954 --> 02:55:33.489
-- IN ORDER TO BE IN ORDER TO

02:55:33.556 --> 02:55:34.690
MEET THE FUNDING COMMITMENTS

02:55:34.891 --> 02:55:36.092
SO IT'S A BIG ELEMENT OF IT

02:55:36.359 --> 02:55:37.927
WITH RESPECT TO ELECTRIC BUSES

02:55:37.994 --> 02:55:40.129
-- THE STATE IS -- SOON GOING

02:55:40.196 --> 02:55:41.597
TO BE ADOPTING A RULE THAT

02:55:41.664 --> 02:55:43.399
REQUIRES ALL TRANSIT AGENCIES TO

02:55:43.466 --> 02:55:45.501
EVENTUALLY CONVERT TO ELECTRICAL

02:55:45.568 --> 02:55:47.837
PROCESSES -- WE ARE BOARD IS

02:55:47.904 --> 02:55:49.472
ALREADY ADOPTED A PLAN THAT

02:55:49.538 --> 02:55:51.307
WOULD HAVE US CONVERT OUR ENTIRE

02:55:51.374 --> 02:55:52.942
FLEET TO ZERO EMISSION BUSES

02:55:53.209 --> 02:55:55.378
BY TWENTY THIRTY WE'RE ACTUALLY

02:55:55.444 --> 02:55:56.679
GOING TO START RECEIVING

02:55:56.746 --> 02:55:58.414
THE FIRST -- ONE HUNDRED AND

02:55:58.481 --> 02:56:00.182
FIVE I BELIEVE OF THOSE BUSES

02:56:00.249 --> 02:56:01.617
NEXT YEAR THERE ARE A LOT OF

02:56:01.684 --> 02:56:03.052
CHALLENGES TO THAT BECAUSE

02:56:03.119 --> 02:56:04.520
THE TECHNOLOGY IS STILL VERY

02:56:04.587 --> 02:56:06.956
EXPENSIVE VEHICLES DON'T PROVIDE

02:56:07.023 --> 02:56:08.424
A RANGE OF SERVICES WE NEED AT

02:56:08.491 --> 02:56:10.559
THIS TIME AND I SHOULD NOTE THE

02:56:11.527 --> 02:56:13.062
THE UTILITY ISSUES ASSOCIATED

02:56:13.129 --> 02:56:14.730
WITH THAT ARE A SIGNIFICANT

02:56:14.797 --> 02:56:16.232
CHALLENGE BECAUSE THE COST OF

02:56:16.299 --> 02:56:17.566
THE CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE

02:56:18.000 --> 02:56:19.335
NOT TO MENTION HOW MUCH WE'RE

02:56:19.402 --> 02:56:20.269
GONNA END UP PAYING FOR LIKE

02:56:20.336 --> 02:56:22.038
TRICITY IS GOING TO BE A BIG

02:56:22.104 --> 02:56:23.773
CHALLENGE IN IN MAKING THAT

02:56:23.839 --> 02:56:25.841
CONVERSION TO HOPE THAT ANSWERS

02:56:25.908 --> 02:56:26.976
YOUR QUESTIONS THANK YOU

02:56:27.643 --> 02:56:29.578
AND AND -- JOHN ON

02:56:31.547 --> 02:56:33.416
NO WE'VE LOST TO TO TO

02:56:33.482 --> 02:56:35.184
DISTRICT SEVEN ABOUT THE

02:56:35.251 --> 02:56:36.786
QUESTION WOULD BE THE SAME NAME

02:56:37.019 --> 02:56:39.588
THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA IS FOR

02:56:39.655 --> 02:56:43.025
EACH REGION FOR EACH COUNTY

02:56:43.459 --> 02:56:45.494
WHAT SORT OF STEPS CAN BE

02:56:45.561 --> 02:56:47.930
TAKEN TO BE SURE THAT WE HAVE

02:56:47.997 --> 02:56:50.299
LOCAL CONTRACTORS GETTING

02:56:50.366 --> 02:56:52.902
GETTING THOSE LOCAL JOBS AND

02:56:52.969 --> 02:56:54.704
GIVING YOU THE THE DIDN'T

02:56:54.770 --> 02:56:56.739
HIRING LOCAL PEOPLE WHERE I

02:56:56.806 --> 02:56:58.841
THINK THE PRIMARY FOCUS WOULD

02:56:58.908 --> 02:57:01.077
HAVE TO BE -- THE OUTREACH

02:57:01.143 --> 02:57:03.179
EFFORTS SO MAKING SURE THAT

02:57:03.245 --> 02:57:05.514
WE ARE HAVING PRE BID MEETINGS

02:57:05.581 --> 02:57:06.749
-- WORKING WITH THE LOCAL

02:57:06.816 --> 02:57:08.985
CONTRACTORS ENCOURAGING THEM

02:57:09.051 --> 02:57:09.952
BECAUSE WE DO HAVE A STATE

02:57:10.019 --> 02:57:11.854
CONTRACT ACT ACT -- THAT DOES

02:57:11.921 --> 02:57:13.889
NOT ALLOW US TO SELECT LIKE

02:57:13.956 --> 02:57:15.925
WITHIN A SPECIFIC COUNTY BUT

02:57:15.992 --> 02:57:17.093
ENCOURAGING THEM TO MAKE SURE

02:57:17.159 --> 02:57:18.394
THAT THEY'RE OUT REACHING TO

02:57:18.461 --> 02:57:19.662
SOME OF THE SMALL BUSINESSES

02:57:19.729 --> 02:57:21.697
AN EXISTING CONTRACTORS --

02:57:21.764 --> 02:57:23.599
WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THAT COUNTY

02:57:25.101 --> 02:57:26.302
IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WOULD

02:57:26.369 --> 02:57:29.071
NEED FROM THE STATE THAT

02:57:29.138 --> 02:57:31.640
WOULD ALLOW A PARTICULAR COUNTY

02:57:31.707 --> 02:57:34.276
THEN TO HELP HELP EIGHT DUE TO

02:57:34.343 --> 02:57:37.880
TO TO TO GIVE PREFERENCE

02:57:37.947 --> 02:57:40.249
TO LOCAL CONTRACTORS -- LIKE

02:57:40.316 --> 02:57:41.384
I SAID WE HAVE THE STATE

02:57:41.450 --> 02:57:42.718
CONTRACT ACT SO I DON'T

02:57:42.785 --> 02:57:44.086
THINK IT'S REALLY ALLOWABLE

02:57:44.153 --> 02:57:46.522
FOR US TO GIVE PREFERENCE

02:57:47.189 --> 02:57:49.225
TO LOCAL CONTRACTORS BUT THE

02:57:49.291 --> 02:57:51.293
OUTRAGE AND THE PRE PRE PRE

02:57:51.360 --> 02:57:52.928
BID MEETING RECONSTRUCTION

02:57:52.995 --> 02:57:54.530
MEETING PRE PRE BID MEETINGS

02:57:54.597 --> 02:57:56.532

02:57:56.599 --> 02:57:58.401
AVENUE -- WE ALSO HAVE A SMALL

02:57:58.467 --> 02:57:59.802
SMALL STATEWIDE SMALL BUSINESS

02:57:59.869 --> 02:58:02.405
COUNCIL -- OF THAT WE ARE

02:58:02.471 --> 02:58:05.341
ACTIVE IN AND WE MEET --

02:58:06.008 --> 02:58:07.443
I THINK SIX TIMES A YEAR HERE

02:58:07.943 --> 02:58:08.944
TO ARE TRYING TO ENCOURAGE THE

02:58:09.011 --> 02:58:10.880
SMALL BUSINESSES TO GET OUT

02:58:11.180 --> 02:58:12.615
AND WITH THEIR CONSTITUENTS

02:58:12.681 --> 02:58:14.350
AND EXPRESSED TO THEM THAT

02:58:14.417 --> 02:58:16.552
NEED FOR FOR THE AVAILABILITY

02:58:16.619 --> 02:58:18.487

QUESTIONS FROM FROM THE PUBLIC

02:58:27.129 --> 02:58:29.598
SO I THINK THAT SOME OF

02:58:29.665 --> 02:58:30.633
MEMBER THAT WOULD BE THE LAST

02:58:30.699 --> 02:58:32.368
QUESTION FOR PANEL TODAY AND I

02:58:32.435 --> 02:58:34.837
DO APPRECIATE IT CERTAINLY ALL

02:58:34.904 --> 02:58:37.139
OF YOU WHO HAVE PARTICIPATED --

02:58:37.206 --> 02:58:40.209
ENSURING THE INFORMATION WITH US

02:58:40.409 --> 02:58:41.744
LAW I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT NOTE

02:58:41.811 --> 02:58:43.212
THE SELECT COMMITTEE HEARINGS

02:58:43.279 --> 02:58:45.648
ARE ARE VALUABLE I THINK NOT

02:58:45.714 --> 02:58:46.949
ONLY FOR THE COMMUNITIES IN

02:58:47.016 --> 02:58:48.684
WHICH WE HOLD THEM BUT THEY ARE

02:58:48.751 --> 02:58:50.519
VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE MEMBERS

02:58:50.586 --> 02:58:52.021
BECAUSE WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY

02:58:52.088 --> 02:58:53.456
TO HEAR FROM THE PUBLIC WE

02:58:53.522 --> 02:58:54.557
HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY HERE FROM

02:58:54.623 --> 02:58:57.359
EXPERTS AND ALSO TO SEE

02:58:57.426 --> 02:58:59.929
HOW THE DECISIONS IMPACT VERY

02:58:59.995 --> 02:59:01.597
SPECIFICALLY TO COMMUNITIES THAT

02:59:01.664 --> 02:59:04.166
WE REPRESENT AND SO FOR MANY

02:59:04.233 --> 02:59:06.368
OF THE ALL ALL PROFESSIONALS

02:59:06.435 --> 02:59:07.436
WHO PRESENTED THEMSELVES

02:59:07.503 --> 02:59:09.271
TODAY IT REALLY GIVES US AN

02:59:09.338 --> 02:59:10.806
OPPORTUNITY TO BE INTIMATE WITH

02:59:11.373 --> 02:59:13.042
THE IMPACTS OF OUR DECISIONS

02:59:13.109 --> 02:59:15.377
AND THE AND ALSO TO HEAR HOW

02:59:15.444 --> 02:59:17.113
WE CAN BE MORE EFFECTIVE IN

02:59:17.179 --> 02:59:19.281
DOING OUR JOB I REMEMBER A

02:59:19.348 --> 02:59:20.883
COUPLE OF YEARS AGO AS WE HELD

02:59:21.083 --> 02:59:22.651
THE SIZE OF HEARINGS IN THE

02:59:22.718 --> 02:59:24.553
COMMUNITIES OF THE SANGAMON

02:59:24.620 --> 02:59:27.256
VALLEY THE COMMENTS CAME BACK

02:59:27.490 --> 02:59:28.757
LOCAL GOVERNMENT DID NOT HAVE

02:59:28.824 --> 02:59:30.993
THE RESOURCES THAT IT NEEDED TO

02:59:31.060 --> 02:59:32.361
-- TO DO DEFERRED MAINTENANCE

02:59:32.428 --> 02:59:35.197
PROJECTS AND SO OUT OF THAT --

02:59:35.264 --> 02:59:37.533
IT IN INFORMED US TO THE POINT

02:59:37.600 --> 02:59:38.934
WHERE WE COULD GO BACK ON YOUR

02:59:39.001 --> 02:59:41.203
PART OF A CONVERSATION AND HELP

02:59:41.270 --> 02:59:42.938
STRUCTURE AND AND RESTAURANTS

02:59:43.005 --> 02:59:44.807
REMEMBER THAT SP ONE WAS VERY

02:59:44.874 --> 02:59:46.108
DIFFICULT AND COMING TOGETHER

02:59:46.175 --> 02:59:47.510
I MEAN IT TOOK A COUPLE OF

02:59:47.743 --> 02:59:49.378
SESSIONS BEFORE WE WERE ABLE TO

02:59:49.445 --> 02:59:51.981
FINALLY COME UP WITH A PROPOSAL

02:59:52.414 --> 02:59:53.749
IN WHICH THE LEGISLATURE COULD

02:59:53.816 --> 02:59:55.417
COULD GET GARNER BIPARTISAN

02:59:55.484 --> 02:59:57.286
SUPPORT OR AND MOVE FORWARD

02:59:57.720 --> 02:59:59.255
AND SO WE FIND OURSELVES AT A

02:59:59.321 --> 03:00:02.057
POINT NOW WHERE OBVIOUSLY OF

03:00:02.124 --> 03:00:03.659
THOSE FUNDS ARE IN JEOPARDY

03:00:03.726 --> 03:00:05.394
BUT I DO BELIEVE THE THE MORE

03:00:05.461 --> 03:00:06.829
INFORMATION THAT THE PUBLIC

03:00:06.896 --> 03:00:08.230
KNOWS ABOUT PROJECTS THAT

03:00:08.297 --> 03:00:09.365
IMPACT ON THEIR COMMUNITY

03:00:09.431 --> 03:00:10.299
I THINK THAT THEY WILL SEE

03:00:10.366 --> 03:00:12.301
THE VALUE AND -- CONTINUE TO

03:00:12.368 --> 03:00:14.236
MOVE FORWARD -- I THINK IT'S

03:00:14.303 --> 03:00:15.905
ALSO IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT

03:00:16.906 --> 03:00:18.140
AND WE CAN BOTH BUT ALL OF US

03:00:18.207 --> 03:00:19.909
HAVE TAKEN NOTE TO THE VARIOUS

03:00:19.975 --> 03:00:21.877
COMMENTS THAT HAS BEEN PRESENTED

03:00:21.944 --> 03:00:22.978
TO US AND I KNOW THAT THERE

03:00:23.045 --> 03:00:24.813
WAS AN EARLIER PRESENTATIONS

03:00:25.214 --> 03:00:27.016
A REFERENCE TO SEEK REFORM AND

03:00:27.082 --> 03:00:29.785
ALSO -- FINDING SOME WAY AVENUE

03:00:29.852 --> 03:00:31.220
TO BRING BACK REDEVELOPMENT

03:00:31.287 --> 03:00:32.588
OR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BECAUSE

03:00:32.655 --> 03:00:34.156
IT HAS IT WAS A VALUABLE

03:00:34.223 --> 03:00:36.725
TOOL AND IT CAN BE AGAIN --

03:00:36.792 --> 03:00:39.495
WE TRIED THIS YEAR -- WE

03:00:39.562 --> 03:00:41.530
WERE HOPING THAT AS GOVERNOR

03:00:41.597 --> 03:00:43.132
BROWN WAS FINISHING HIS LAST

03:00:44.233 --> 03:00:46.869
TERM GOOD -- -- HE WOULD KINDA

03:00:46.936 --> 03:00:48.170
LOSE THAT'LL GRINCH THE STOLE

03:00:48.237 --> 03:00:49.972
CHRISTMAS -- ATTITUDE AROUND

03:00:50.039 --> 03:00:52.641
REDEVELOPMENT AND MAYBE EMBRACES

03:00:52.708 --> 03:00:54.643
-- ANOTHER SHOT AT IT BUT IT

03:00:54.710 --> 03:00:56.679
WAS CLEAR THAT THAT WAS NOT

03:00:56.745 --> 03:00:57.680
GOING TO HAPPEN AND I DON'T

03:00:57.746 --> 03:00:58.847
MEAN THAT AS A CRITICISM OF THE

03:00:58.914 --> 03:00:59.882
GOVERNOR BECAUSE HE'S DONE A

03:00:59.949 --> 03:01:02.585
FANTASTIC JOB AND AND HE STANDS

03:01:02.651 --> 03:01:04.386
BEHIND US IF YOU WANT IT IS

03:01:04.753 --> 03:01:06.088
GOING TO BE CONTINUING TO STAND

03:01:06.155 --> 03:01:08.190
FOR ON MANY INITIATIVES THAT

03:01:08.557 --> 03:01:10.593
ARE OR ARE PROVEN TO BE VERY

03:01:10.993 --> 03:01:12.361
BENEFICIAL TO THE STATES OR

03:01:12.428 --> 03:01:14.530
PROCEDURES LEADERSHIP BUT BUT

03:01:14.597 --> 03:01:16.098
I THINK THAT IT'S VERY CLEAR

03:01:16.165 --> 03:01:17.866
THAT HAVING SOME TYPE OF A

03:01:18.534 --> 03:01:20.169
RE LOOK AT REDEVELOPMENT HOW

03:01:20.236 --> 03:01:22.438
THAT CAN BE STRUCTURES FOR TO

03:01:22.504 --> 03:01:24.106
HELP COMMUNITIES WILL BE VERY

03:01:24.173 --> 03:01:26.175
ESSENTIAL ESPECIALLY AS YOU SEE

03:01:26.642 --> 03:01:28.277
THESE REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION

03:01:28.344 --> 03:01:29.478
SYSTEMS SYSTEMS MAKE THEIR

03:01:29.545 --> 03:01:30.913
WAY THROUGH THE VARIOUS

03:01:30.980 --> 03:01:33.749
COMMUNITIES AND IT WILL BRING

03:01:33.816 --> 03:01:34.950
LIKE IT DID IN MY COMMUNITY

03:01:35.017 --> 03:01:36.585
MY CITY OF PASADENA THAT I

03:01:37.186 --> 03:01:38.754
SERVED ON THE CITY COUNCIL ON

03:01:39.455 --> 03:01:41.724
IT BROUGHT -- TRANSIT ORIENTED

03:01:41.790 --> 03:01:43.359
DEVELOPMENT HOUSING IN THE

03:01:43.425 --> 03:01:46.462
DOWNTOWN IT SPURRED ECONOMIC

03:01:46.528 --> 03:01:47.930
DEVELOPMENT FOR THE RETAIL

03:01:48.364 --> 03:01:49.865
CORRIDOR OPACITY IN IT WOULD

03:01:49.932 --> 03:01:51.433
NOT BE WHAT IT IS TODAY IF IT

03:01:51.500 --> 03:01:53.569
WERE NOT INVESTMENT OF PARKING

03:01:53.636 --> 03:01:56.105
STRUCTURES BUT ALSO -- HOW

03:01:56.605 --> 03:01:58.340
THE LIGHT RAIL HAS PROVIDED AN

03:01:58.407 --> 03:02:00.309
INCENTIVE IN AN ECONOMIC BOOST

03:02:00.376 --> 03:02:02.344
TO THAT PARTICULAR CITY CITY

03:02:02.411 --> 03:02:03.979
SO THE SAME TYPE OF CITIZEN

03:02:04.046 --> 03:02:06.448
OPPORTUNITIES EXIST US FOR

03:02:06.515 --> 03:02:08.917
OTHER PARTS OF THE REGION AND

03:02:08.984 --> 03:02:11.420
