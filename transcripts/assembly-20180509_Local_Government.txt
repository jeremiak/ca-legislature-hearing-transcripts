GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M THRILLED TO BE HERE WITH YOU THIS AFTERNOON TO PRESENT AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTY TWO. ARE ALSO KNOWN AS THE CALIFORNIA'S SUSTAINABLE AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING ACT WHICH WOULD INCENTIVIZE THE PRODUCTION OF AFFORDABLE WORKFORCE AND LOW INCOME HOUSING. ALONG TRANSIT PRIORITY QUARTERS. THIS BILL A WITH A HOW AIMS TO TRY MAKE A DENT IN THE ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION HOMES OUR STATE NEEDS OVER THE NEXT SIX YEARS BY CREATING A NEW STATEWIDE OPT IN PROGRAM. IT AMENDS DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS TWO ALLOWS FOR THE USE OF FLOOR AREA RATIO BASE CALCULATION SYSTEM RATHER THAN THE DWELLING UNITS PER ACRE AND MANY OF YOU PUBLIC CAME VERY FAMILIAR WITH DURING YOUR TOURS ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT SERVICE. THIS WILL ESSENTIALLY ALLOW FOR MORE SMALLER UNITS TO BE BUILT THAT WOULD OTHERWISE UNDER CURRENT RULES. TWENTY PERCENT OF THESE UNITS UNDER THIS BILL WOULD BAR PROPOSED TO BE AT OR BELOW FIFTY PERCENT AREA MEDIAN INCOME AND REMAIN AT THAT AFFORDABILITY LEVEL FOR FIFTY FIVE YEARS. ADDITIONALLY IMPACT FEES WILL BE CALCULATED BASED ON SQUARE FEET RATHER THAN A PER UNIT BASIS AND HIDE THE PROJECT WOULD REMAIN WOULD STILL BE REGULATED BY THE UNDERLYING BASE ZONING. SO ANY CONCERNS ABOUT MUCH TALLER BUILDINGS WHICH HAVE BEEN ACTING IN THE BUILDING RECENTLY THIS IS NOT THAT. BIGGEST GRAYSON A THE CASA ACT DOES NOT USE PUBLICLY FUNDED DOLLARS IN THIS IS IMPORTANT WHEN I TALK ABOUT SUBSIDIZING THESE UNITS WITH TAXPAYER DOLLARS FOR USING MARKET DRIVEN APPROACHES. TO CREATE MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR FOLKS WHO ARE WORKING AND MIDDLE CLASS. THIS BILL. IS A LABOR OF LOVE FOR OUR THAT WAS JOINT EFFORT THAT WAS A BURKE OUT OF A CONVERSATION I HAD WITH SOME OF MY I'VE OF FORMER COLLEAGUES IN CITY OF SAN DIEGO SPECIFICALLY.

AS MR GLORIA MENTIONED ON THE BILL CAME TO US FROM A CITY COUNCIL MEMBER WHO'S KIND OF ON THE FRONT LINES OF TRYING TO. TO DEVELOP AND. AND PROVIDE THAT KIND OF. RESIDENTIAL ASSISTANCE. THIS BILL IS AN OPT IN FOR CITIES OF FOR COMMUNITIES THAT WISH TO ADOPT THIS ORDINANCE. I MISS ALSO ARE NOT TO INFER DEVELOPER SO WE THINK IT'S A PERFECT PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP ON BETWEEN CITIES AND DEVELOPERS WHO WISH TO. OF FIND THE RIGHT PLACE AND THE RIGHT TIME FOR THIS TYPE OF DEVELOPMENT. COOL AND. WE DO THINK THAT. THAT THAT IS AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT I KNOW THAT YOUR ANALYSIS DID RAISE THE QUESTION OF. WHETHER IT'S NEEDED AND WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN SAN DIEGO. WHILE YES THERE ARE SOME OF THESE PROPOSALS THAT COULD PUT BE PUT FORTH. BY COMMUNITIES ON THEIR OWN THIS BY HAVING A STATE STATUTE AYE WE CAN WE CAN. TRUNCATE A LOT OF THE PROCESS WE CAN REALLY MOVE MUCH MORE QUICKLY AND TO GET THESE RESIDENTIAL UNITS ON THE STREET VERY VERY QUICKLY.

WHICH SEEKS TO IMPROVE THE SEWER INFRASTRUCTURE CALIFORNIA HAS THE SEWERS A SEWER SYSTEM THAT VARIES CONSIDERABLY. IN SIZE AND QUALITY CONVEYING I'M SU WHICH CAN BE EXPRESSLY DIFFICULT FOR SMALL SEWER SYSTEMS BECAUSE THEY OFTEN HAVE FEWER RESOURCES FOR MAINTENANCE AND TREATMENT CONSOLIDATING. SMALL SEWER SYSTEMS CAN HELP ADDRESS AS SUCH CHALLENGES HOWEVER. CURRENT CURRENTLY THERE IS A KEY BARRIER TO CITIES THAT WANT TO CONSOLIDATE EXISTING LAW REQUIRES A TWO THIRDS OF VOTE OF THE CITY AND ITS RESIDENTS TO SELL SEWER SYSTEMS. SINCE THE COSTS. OF THESE ELECTIONS IT'S PROHIBITIVE FOR A MANY SMALL CITIES I'M HAVING SUCH A HIGH BORDER THRESHOLD IS PROBLEMATIC MORE OVER THE SALE OF THE DRINKING WATERS. A WATER SYSTEMS ONLY REQUIRE A MAJORITY OF VOTE FROM CITIES AND ITS RESIDENTS OF THIS BILL WOULD THEREFORE ALLOW A CITY TO CONSOLIDATE ITS SEWER SYSTEM WITH A MAJORITY VOTE. UP OF ITS COUNCIL AND LOCAL RESIDENTS. THIS THANK YOU. THIS WILL ENCOURAGE CONSOLIDATION AND ULTIMATELY IMPROVE OUR STATE SEWER OP INFRASTRUCTURE TODAY. IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL WE HAVE.

IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN BECAUSE OF ANNUAL OPERATING DEFICITS. THE CITY OF PARIS MADE THE DIFFICULT DECISION TO SELL IT SMALL WATER AND SEWER UTILITIES AND MY COMPANY WAS SELECTED. THROUGH A COMPETITIVE PROCESS THE SALE OF THE UTILITIES REQUIRED A PUBLIC VOTE OF THE CITY RESIDENTS. THE CITY COUNCIL PLACE MEASURE G. NH ON THE NOVEMBER STE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN BALLOT. MEASURE G. AUTHORIZED THE SALE OF SEWER UTILITY AND REQUIRED TO SUPERMAJORITY OR TWO THIRDS OF THE VOTERS. MEASURE H. AUTHORIZED THE SALE OF THE TWO WATER UTILITIES AND REQUIRED A SIMPLE MAJORITY OF VOTES. MEASURE H. PASSED WITH SIXTY FOUR PERCENT OF THE VOTERS SUPPORTING THE SALE THE WATER UTILITIES. MEASURE MEASURE G. FAILED WITH SIXTY TWO PERCENT OF THE VOTERS SUPPORTING THE SALE OF THE. SEWER UTILITY. AB TWO ONE SEVEN NINE ENCOURAGES VOLUNTARY CONSOLIDATION A MUNICIPAL SEWER UTILITIES BY ALLOWING THE VOTERS TO APPROVE THE SALE OF THE SEWER UTILITY BY A SIMPLE MAJORITY VOTE.

MEASURES OF SEVEN ZERO THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU FOR THAT. LET'S MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER ELEVEN A. B. THIRTY ONE NINETY FOUR DID DALY. GOOD AFTERNOON MR DALY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THE HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT WAS IT WAS APPROVED. BY THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR BACK IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO. TO LIMIT THE LOCAL AGENCIES ABILITY TO DISAPPROVE OR REQUIRE DENSITY REDUCTIONS IN RESIDENTIAL HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS. UNDER THE ACT WHEN A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT COMPLIES WITH OBJECTIVE PLANNING RULES THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT CANNOT DENY THE PROJECT OR REDUCE ITS DENSITY UNLESS IT MAKES A FINDING THAT THE PROJECT WOULD HAVE A SPECIFIC ADVERSE IMPACT. ON PUBLIC HEALTH OR SAFETY THAT CANNOT OTHERWISE BE MITIGATED. UNFORTUNATELY SOME LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE REQUIRED HOUSING PROJECTS TO OBTAIN REZONING SORE VARIANCES ON A PROJECT BY PROJECT BASIS. EVEN ON THOSE PROJECTS ARE CONSISTENT WITH HOUSING DENSITIES AND OTHER OBJECTIVE STANDARDS. THESE TYPES OF REZONING IS ARE VARIANCES ARE AWAY FROM LOCALS TO EVADE COMPLIANCE WITH THE ACT. ON THE GROUNDS THAT PROJECTS ARE SUBSEQUENTLY INCONSISTENT WITH EXISTING ZONING STANDARDS. CONSISTENT WITH SEVERAL BILLS ENACTED INTO LAW LAST YEAR THIS BILL STRENGTHENS. THE HOUSING ACCOUNTED ACCOUNTABILITY ACT BY CLOSING LOOPHOLES THAT UNDERMINE THE LAWS APPLICABILITY AND EFFECTIVENESS. I'M COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE SPONSOR AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT GROUPS TO TRY TO FIND COMPROMISE LANGUAGE FOR THIS BILL. WHICH SEEKS TO UPHOLD THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE ACT TO ENSURE THAT MORE HOUSING GETS BUILT IN CALIFORNIA. THIS IS A CHALLENGING SUBJECT. BUT TO I'M COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO WORK TWO OF ESTABLISH HIGHER STANDARDS FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO ADHERE TO AS THEY CONSIDER HOUSING PROJECTS. HERE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL IS AARON GUERRERO REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION. WELL. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS AND YES THIS BILL AS I WAS SPONSORED BY THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION IN AN EFFORT TO REINVIGORATE THE HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT WHICH WAS INTENDED. TO SPUR. HOUSING DEVELOPMENT WHICH WE ARE GREATLY IN NEED OF OUTWARD VERY THANKFUL TO MISTER DALY FOR LEADING THE CHARGE ON THIS AND. JUST TO UNDERSCORE THE INTENT OVER THE YEARS SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO THERE'VE BEEN. MANY INSTANCES WHERE THE ACT IS EASILY CIRCUMVENTED SO WE'RE TRYING TO CLOSE LOOPHOLES TO REALLY GET BACK TO THE INTENT OF THE HOUSING COUNT ABILITY ACT. AND AND TO ECHO OF THE AUTHOR WE ARE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE OPPONENTS TO YOU KNOW ADDRESS SOME OTHER ISSUES AS WE MOVE FORWARD. AND IT'S NOT OUR INTENT TO. YOU KNOW SOME OF THE ISSUES ESPECIALLY REGARDING THE IMPACT ON RURAL COMMUNITIES. WE WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND. IN THE INTEREST OF BREVITY WE ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DESERVED ONE ELSE'S PART OF THE BILL. I DEMOCRATS WITH THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. ADAM RIDLEY A BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE ALSO SUPPORT THANKS. SEAN DOES THE NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT BUSINESS REPRESENTING SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS OFTEN SPORT. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OF SUPPORT. SEEING NONE WILL MOVE ON WITNESSES AND OTHER OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS CLOSELY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES. I'M RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED AND WE DO APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S INTENT TO CONTINUE WORKING. I'M WITH US AND WE THINK WE'VE ACTUALLY OUTLINED A FAIR COMPROMISE ON INCLUDED IN YOUR ANALYSIS TODAY. I'M BUT ESSENTIALLY ARE OUR PROBLEM IS KIND OF WITH THE CORE PREMISE OF THE BILL WHICH IS BASICALLY THAT THE GENERAL PLAN. SHOULD FUNCTION AS THE ZONING CODE AND WE THINK THAT ESPECIALLY BECAUSE OF THE WAY GENERAL PLANS ARE CONSTRUCTED IN UNINCORPORATED AREAS AND THE FACT THAT THEY ARE INTENDED TO BE A VERY LONG TERM PLAN. THERE IS GOING TO BE A SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE A PARCEL MAYBE ZONED AT LOW DENSITY AND BE INCLUDED WITHIN A MUCH BROADER RANGE OF DENSITY. IN THE LONG RANGE PLAN FOR THE COUNTY OR FOR THE CITY AND SO FOR THAT REASON WE THINK THAT IT'S MUCH BETTER RATHER THAN FOCUSING IN SAYING. THAT LONG TERM PLAN SHOULD SHOULD SERVE AS THE DE FACTO ZONING CODE IS THAT WHEN WE HAVE SET OUT THE AREAS ON A PARCEL BY PARCEL BASIS IN OUR HOUSING ELEMENTS. AND SAID THIS IS WHERE WE WANT HOUSING GROWTH TO HAPPEN AT THESE DENSITIES THEN THAT'S AN APPROPRIATE OPPORTUNITY TO USE THAT. GENERAL PLAN LEVEL DENSITY INSTEAD OF WHAT'S IN THE ZONING CODE BUT JUST BECAUSE SOMETHING IS ZONED AT A LOW DENSITY DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT SHOULD YOU KNOW BE TO FACTO UP STONES. AND BECAUSE IT'S IN THE SAME CATEGORY AS A HIGHER DENSITY PARCEL IN THE GENERAL PLAN AND SAW GIVEN EXAMPLE ABOUT WHERE THAT MATTERS. IN THE UNINCORPORATED SOUND SO IN A LOT OF RURAL COUNTIES ZONING IS BASED ON PARCEL SIZES AND SO FOR INSTANCE. I WON COUNTY I WAS TALKING TO ABOUT THIS BILL HAS IS ADEPT LAND USE DESIGNATION THAT RANGES FROM FIVE TO FORTY ACRE ZONING AND SO FOR INSTANCE. UNDER THIS BILL. THAT ZONING FOR WHAT WOULD CURRENTLY BE A FORTY ACRE PARCEL AND ALLOW PERHAPS ONE RESIDENTIAL UNIT WOULD NOW HAVE TO BE APPROVED. BY THE LOCAL AGENCY TO ALLOW EIGHT FIVE ACRE PARCELS AND SO THE ZONING WASN'T SET UP WITH THE INTENT OF ALLOWING HIGHER DENSITY USE ON THOSE LARGER PARCELS IN THE MORE RURAL AREAS AND SO. WE THINK WHAT THIS IS REALLY CREATING IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR LEAPFROG DEVELOPMENT THAT'S INCONSISTENT WITH THE BROADER LAND USE POLICIES OF THE COUNTY OR THE CITY AND SO. FOR THAT REASON WE PROPOSE NARROWING IT AS OUTLINED IN THE ANALYSIS AND LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SEE ANY GEORGE REPRESENTING AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION. WE ALSO AGREE WITH THE COMMENTS OF SEE SEPARATE THIS ISN'T JUST AN URBAN OR RURAL COUNTY ISSUE. THEY HOUSING ELEMENT ITSELF IS REALLY DESIGNED TO SHOW. THE DEVELOPERS THE JURISDICTION WHERE YOU GONNA GROW AND WE'RE GONNA GO NEXT SO ALL THE SERVICES CONSISTENT WITH S. B. THREE SEVENTY FIVE ALL YOUR INFRASTRUCTURE IS THERE IN PLACE AND THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO GROW. NEXT THE GENERAL PLAN IN THE LAND USE ELEMENT ARE UP TO THIRTY YEARS OUT IN BROADER NOW. SO THEY MAY SAY WE'RE GONNA GO HERE NOW BUT THIS LAYER IS THE NEXT ONE WILL GROWTH WE NEED TO. OF A ONE DO DENSITY FIRST IN THE INFILL. AND THEN THIS IS GOING TO BE TWENTY YEARS OUT THIS IS GONNA BE THIRTY YEARS OUT. WITH THIS BILL BECAUSE YOU WOULD HAVE TO DO A REZONING THEY COULD LEAPFROG TO HEAR. AND EVEN IF IT'S CITY CITY CITY AND THEN ANNEXED PARCELS HERE. WE DON'T WANT TO JUMP AHEAD OF S. B. THREE SEVENTY FIVE AND WHERE ALL THE SERVICES ARE. SOLD FOR US THAT'S A HUGE ISSUE AND WE DON'T MIND CONTINUE WORK WE APPRECIATE THAT BUT WE ALSO WANT TO DO THAT FAIRLY SOON BECAUSE THIS IS CONTINUING WITH THE SAME PROBABLY THAT WITH THE ORIGINAL BELL. ON THE SECOND PIECE THE BILL I JUST WANT TO MENTION QUICKLY WAS INTENT LANGUAGE DEALING WITH A SPECIFIC ADVERSE IMPACTS. THE LANGUAGE IS NOT CLEAR IT HAS DEFINITIONS THAT ARE NOT DEFINED WE DON'T WANNA HAVE TO GO TO COURT TO IDENTIFY HOW WE USE THAT. BECAUSE IT'S INTENT LANGUAGE IT IS NOT STATUTORY LANGUAGE SO WE THINK THE EXISTING ADVERSE IMPACT. LANGUAGE IS VERY DIFFICULT TO USE RIGHT NOW IT'S REALLY DOWN THE FIRE FLOOD AND. ANYTHING ELSE IS A NATURAL DISASTER BUT IF WE NEED IT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO USE IT SO THAT I THINK YOU THERE HAS TO BE REMOVED OR SUBSTANTIALLY REFINED. BUT WE'RE STILL NOT CLEAR WHY THE EXISTING STATUTE WHICH IS VERY SPECIFIC AND VERY DIFFICULT TO USE IS AN ADEQUATE OF THE BILLS THAT WE OUGHT STILL OPPOSE THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IS THERE ANYONE ELSE. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. TRACY RARE O'CONNOR REPRESENTS A CALIFORNIA. ALSO IMPOSE LESS MINUTE FOR THE REASONS STATED THANK YOU THANK YOU.% TILLMAN ABORTIVE URBAN CARRIES A CALIFORNIA ALSO IMPOSE LESS AMENDED THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE OPPOSITION. ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE. YES. ASSEMBLYMEMBER WATER WOULD YOU LIKE YOU JUST. JUST TRYING TO CLARIFY OIL THOUGH SO. I FIGURE I CAN GO OFF MY EXPERIENCE AS A LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIAL. YOU KNOW THE WAY THEY ARE CITY WAS DESIGNED IN TWO YEARS. SO THAT AS IT WENT OUT. WAS MORE RURAL. SUBURBAN AND URBAN URBAN CORE. SO BASICALLY THIS WOULD ALLOW. HIGH DENSITY TO. EVEN IF THE NEXT PARCEL OVER WAS NOT ZONED AT THE SAME DENSITY IS THIS ONE. IT COULD ACTUALLY GO OUT INTO THAT AREA. AND BE THE SAME ZONING IS THE ONE ADJACENT. I THINK IT WOULD DEPEND ON THE LANGUAGE IN THE GENERAL PLAN. AND THE HOUSING ELEMENT. IN THAT CITY. THE OTHER LOT OF OTHER FACTORS ARM I DON'T WANNA SAY THAT THAT COULD NOT HAPPEN ABSOLUTELY BUT IT IS IT. SHOULD NOT HAPPEN. IT SHOULD NOT HAPPEN. AN I WANT TO JUST COMMENT ON THEM. ON ON WHAT WAS SAID. BY WILL ABSOLUTELY CONTINUE TO WORK WITH. THOSE WHO HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE SOME OF THE DEFINITIONS. AND THE VERY POINT THAT YOU'RE RAISING WHICH IS THE. THE. WHAT THEY SAY IS THE POSSIBILITY OF LEAP FROG THE DEVELOPMENT? I THINK IT DEPENDS ON THE DEFINITIONS AND IT DEPENDS ON THE GENERAL PLAN AND THE HOUSING ELEMENT SO THEY ALL THEY ALL ARE SUPPOSED TO WORK. BOB. IN A COMPLEMENTARY FASHION. IF THEY DON'T. A JURISDICTION IN MY OPINION THE JURISDICTION MAYBE HAS TO REVISIT ITS OWN DOCUMENTS. BUT THIS IS WHY WE HAVE I HOUSING CRISIS IS BECAUSE A LOT OF JURISDICTIONS THESE. THESE PLANS DON'T ARE NOT COMPLEMENTARY. AND WE WE WANT THEM TO BE COMPLIMENTARY. AND SO ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO TO. TO PASS LAWS THAT THAT ENCOURAGED THAT I THINK IS A GOOD IDEA. SO. YEAH NAM. THE COURSE LEAPFROG DEVELOPMENT. IS A PRETTY BROAD PHRASE TO ME HOW MANY UNITS ARE WE TALKING ABOUT ULTIMATELY. ME WE NEED A LOT MORE UNITS IN CALIFORNIA AND THIS IS WHY WE DON'T ALWAYS GET THEM. BECAUSE JURISDICTIONS DON'T HAVE A LOT OF INCENTIVES TO GET THEIR PLANNING ACTS. ORGANIZED IT IS EXPENSIVE FOR INSTANCE FOR GENERAL OF YOU KNOW TO UPDATE A GENERAL PLAN OR UPDATE HOUSING ELEMENT COSTS MONEY. AND. SOME LOCAL JURISDICTIONS KEEP KICKING THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD BECAUSE. DAY. I DON'T SEE IT AS A PRIORITY. TO HAVE THEIR HAVE THEIR. THEIR GENERAL PLAN HOUSING ELEMENT LAND USE ELEMENT TRANSPORTATION ELEMENT AND SO FORTH ALL IN SYNC. THAT'S A LONG WINDED ANSWER A MISS WALDRON BUT SOME. I WANT THIS. BILL TO IMPROVE THE PLANNING PROCESS. NOT. OPEN THE DOOR TO BAD PLANNING MINE. ONE OF THE ISSUES WE HAD WITH OUR TEARS WAS THAT. WE ONLY WOULD YOU KNOW LOOK TO. BUILD AT THE DENSITY IN THE GENERAL PLAN WHEN THE INFRASTRUCTURE WAS AVAILABLE. WHICH WAS OUR. GOAL OF NOT. NINA PREVENTING THE LEAPFROG. SO IF YOU HAVE ZONING AND ADJACENT AREAS ORINDA DIFFERENCE OWN LEVEL. BUT THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS NOT THERE AND IT'S NOT JUST SEWER AND WATER COULD BE POLICE FIRE SERVICE AND ALL THOSE THINGS THOSE ARE AN ISSUE. THAT THE CITY. HAS TO LOOK AT WHEN IT'S PLANNING. SO THAT'S YOU KNOW. JUST WHAT THE OPPONENT OPPONENTS WAS SAYING KIND OF RAISE THAT CONCERN TO ME THAT. YOU KNOW IF THIS IS GOING TO. RESULT IN OF GENERAL PLANS ALLOWING HIGH DENSITY DEVELOPMENT INTO AREAS THAT DON'T HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE AREA. WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN WITH THE PROJECT HAVE TO SIT AND WAIT. UNTIL THAT'S AVAILABLE OUR HOUSE AND YOU KNOW. I THINK PART OF THE PROBLEM WHERE. MY CITY IN JUST COULD COME OFF MY EXPERIENCE BEING AN OLDER CITY AT. PRETTY MUCH BILLS OUT BUT YET IN THESE HOUSING ELEMENTS IN THESE YOU KNOW ALL OF THE REGIONAL PLANNING AGENCIES ALWAYS TRYING TO PUT MORE HOUSING IN. THEN YOU COULD REALLY FIT AND. THESE OLDER CITIES WANT TO DO INFILL THEY DON'T WANNA GO OUT INTO THESE OTHER AREAS SO. IT'S KIND OF A BALANCING ACT I PROMISE YOU I WILL BE WORKING WITH THE OPPONENTS TO. TO RESOLVE THAT ISSUE. AND THE ALL STAY IN TOUCH WITH THIS COMMITTEE TO. BUT BUT TO DO THAT. I'M I DON'T THINK I MEAN I. YEAH THESE ARE THORNY ISSUES. BUT IF WE DON'T. PUSH FORWARD. I MEAN I I FEEL TO. THE ME TO USE PLANNING. AS AN EXCUSE. TO NOT ALLOW HOUSING. IS A PROBLEM ALSO. SO WE'VE GOT A FIND A SWEET SPOT WHERE WE ENCOURAGE MORE PLANNING AND PLANS TO BE UP TO DATE OF GENERAL PLANS. R. ARE TOO FAR ADDED DATE THEY ARE LONG TERM PLANNING DOCUMENTS. BUT WE NEED THEM TO REFLECT TODAY'S REALITIES AS WELL. SO THAT'S. YOU KNOW THE USER THESE ARE VERY COMPLICATED CONCEPTS BUT IN PRACTICE AND I THINK MAYBE WE NEED TO. HAVE SOME EXAMPLES FROM SOME SPECIFIC EXAMPLES. IF THERE ARE COUNTIES THAT DON'T WANT DENSITIES IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THEIR COUNTIES SAY THAT JUST SAY IT LOUD AND CLEAR. YOU KNOW YEAH. I KNOW BECAUSE ARE THE CITY I WASN'T RECENTLY UPDATED ITS GENERAL PLAN AND IT WAS LITERALLY A TEN YEAR PROCESS WHO THEN BOWIE OTHER TALENTS NO IT'S ARDUOUS IT'S. IT'S HARD IT'S IN HOUSING ELEMENTS ARE NOTORIOUSLY. CHALLENGING. AND IN THE STATE HAS A ROLE IN HOUSING ELEMENTS TO. AND ON AND ON BUT I BOMB I WAS IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT FOR A FOURTEEN YEARS NAM. AND. I A. CAREA LOT ABOUT GOOD PLANNING RATIONAL PLANNING SO PEOPLE HAVE PREDICTABILITY INFRASTRUCTURE. MUST BE AVAILABLE. SO WE'LL DO OUR BEST TO. AT DEEPER CONVERSATIONS WITH THESE FOLKS ARE. WITH THE PLANNING ASSOCIATION AND. THE CAT WITH D. AND C. SACK. AND. I TRY TO FIND A SWEET SPOT. SOME RECORD. DEPECHE PERFECT WHEN IT ANY OTHER QUESTIONS YES ASSEMBLYMEMBER COOLEY BUDGETS WAS SAY I. I WILL SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY TOM BUT I DO THINK THIS IS A VERY. VERY IMPORTANT CONSCIOUS HAVE VERY COMPLICATED ONE. WE HAVE ZONING WE HAVE THE GENERAL PLANNED LAW. WE ADDED. AS WAS ALLUDED TO SP THREE SEVENTY FIVE SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES. WHICH SUPPORTS MORE COMPACT DEVELOPED LET'S A JOURNAL PART OF OUR RESPONSE TO GLOBAL WARMING. THAT'S A NEW OVERLAY. THAT HAS KIND OF FORCED COMMUNITIES TO KIND OF A LINE THERE GENERAL PLANS WITH THE SUSTAINABLE. COMMUNITY SO THERE HAVE BEEN SOME PRESSURES ALREADY. IT'S NOT JUST YOU GOT THE ZONING AND THE GENERAL PLAN AT THE COUNTY LEVEL BUT YOU YOU DO HAVE SOME STATE POLICY THAT'S. MOVE DAN. AND SO SOME OF THESE PIECES START ALIGNING. AND SO THIS ISSUE OF LEAPFROG DEVELOPMENT ACTUALLY DOES TIE INTO S. B. THROUGH SEVENTY FIVE AND HOW ALL THE PIECES FIT TOGETHER. IT'S ACTUALLY VERY COMPLICATED FIELD HEARINGS CHECK ON A COUNTY. IF YOU HOP IN A CAR. AT THE EAST MOST NEIGHBORHOOD IN RANCHO CORDOVA. AND DR TO THE URBAN SERVICES BOUNDARY. IN MY DISTRICT IT'S ABOUT A TWENTY FIVE MINUTE DRIVE EAST. AND THERE IS PEOPLE WHO BOUGHT A LOT OF THIS. ACREAGE UP BY THE TENS OF THOUSANDS IN THE EIGHTIES. AND SOME OF THESE FOLKS Y. BOUGHT THIS LAND ANTICIPATING DEVELOPMENT. AND THEN THINGS HAVE CHANGED IN THE INNER MEANING TIMES. SO YOU COULD HAVE SOME FOLKS WHO HAVE THIS PROPERTY WOULD LIKE TO GET IN DEVELOPMENTS SOON AS POSSIBLE. BECAUSE TIME IS ON THEIR MONEY IS WASTED. SO I'D. I THINK THE FOCUS OF THE BILL ON ZONING IN THE GENERAL PLAN IS A GOOD THING THE CHICK WE GOTTA KEEP IN MIND THAT THEY ACTUALLY THE STATUS ENUNCIATED ITS OWN. LAYER POLICY. THE SUPPORT FOR THIS. FAVORING COMPACT ENVELOPMENT IN AVOIDING LEAPFROG DEVELOPMENT. SO I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF. A LOT OF POLICY THAT'S OUT HERE. AND. WE GOTTA KINDA NOT JUST FOCUS ON THE LOCAL STUFF BUT HOW IT FEELS TO THE STATE. RELEVANT STATUTE. THE CONCERNS OF THE OPPOSITION I TAKE VERY VERY SERIOUSLY AND I WANT TO RESOLVE THEM. AND. I THINK IT'S WORTH. THIS IS A A CHALLENGE WORTH PURSUING. AND. MAMA DO MY BEST TO FIND THE SWEET SPOT. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS YES IS A SOLANO HERRERA. I ACTUALLY. DON'T HAVE A QUESTION OTHER THAN THAT AND THEN I HAVE A COMMENT IS. REALLY APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO HERE I THINK THAT THE CHALLENGES. THAT. WOULD YOU KNOW WHAT WORKS BETTER THE CARRIER THE STICK. AND. WE ALWAYS END UP COMING HERE IN. PASSING LEGISLATION BECAUSE THERE'S ABOUT ACTOR OUT THERE THAT. OR MAYBE UP A LOT ABOUT ACTORS RIGHT THERE'S A LOTTA NIMBIS OUT THERE THAT JUST THEY REALLY DELVE TELL YOU I'M FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING I WANT HOUSING AND THEN THE MINUTE YOU START PROPOSING IT. THERE'S NOT A GOODS GOOD PLACE FOR IT AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT THIS WHOLE AREA IS SET UP TO DO. AND THEN AT SOME POINT. I'M GONNA SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY I THINK EVEN IF THEY'RE SOME WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. I THINK IT'S. THERE I CAN THINK OF LANGUAGE THAT WORKS TO DEAL WITH THAT THIS. THE IS NOT TO BE USED AS A TO LEAPFROG VACANT PARCELS ALONG THE WAY. ON. BUT BUT AT SOME POINT I THINK WE NEED TO GET TO A POINT WHERE WE SAY YOU HAVE TO HAVE A. HOUSING ELEMENT THAT'S CURRENT AND APPROVED YOU HAVE TO HAVE A GENERAL PLAN IT'S AT LEAST WITH THE NEXT NUMBER OF YEARS SO THEY'VE LOOKED AT IT RECENTLY AND. AND THEN WORK ON IT. YOU HAVE TO HAVE YOUR ZONING ORDINANCE OF UP TO. TWO IT THAT CONSISTENT WITH YOUR GENERAL PLANNING YOUR HOUSING ELEMENT. AND IF YOU DO ALL OF THAT YOUR FIRST IN LINE FOR STATE MONEY AND IF YOU DON'T IF YOU'RE NOT DOING ANY OF THOSE IF YOU IF IF THERE'S ANY OF THOSE ARE DEFICIENT YOU KNOW GETS. RESOURCES TO BUILD. BOTH IN TERMS OF ROADS TRANSPORTATION AND HOUSING INFRASTRUCTURE BECAUSE THOSE THAT ARE DOING ALL OF THAT. AND THAT ARE ACTUALLY BUILDING THE RENO NUMBER. SHOULD BE FIRST IN LINE AND THERE ARE COMMUNITIES ARE GOING TO RESIST IT TO THE END AND IF THEY WANT TO RESIST IT THAT'S FINE BUT THEN THERE'S NO OTHER STATE RESOURCES TO COME. COME THEIR WAY AND IT JUST IT MAKES THE GOOD GUYS. GIVES THEM THE CARROTS A NEED TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE DOING THE GOOD THINGS I THINK AND SO. I AM. I AM A BIG BELIEVER THAT THE CARROTS GET YOU MOVING A LOT FASTER THAN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO. SMACK EVERYBODY UPSIDE THE HEAD THAT'S NOT DOING WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO. UP AND THEN ALLOWING. KIND OF A PUNITIVE TYPE OF OF. PROCESS RATHER THAN MAKE IT BECAUSE IT'S GOT MORE MORE COMPLICATED WHEN YOU START ADDING DENSITY BONUSES AND TODAY WE'LL LOOK AT WILL LOOK AT THAT FLOOR AREA RATIO IS AND KNOW ALL THESE THINGS THAT. CREATE A COMPLICATED. MATRIX THAT A LITTLE BIT AND PHAM REALLY WHAT WE WANT IS BUILDING. THOUGH I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO HERE TODAY AND I'M I'M SUPPORTIVE AND I HOPE THAT YOU'LL BE ABLE TO GET TO THAT. AMENDMENTS NECESSARY TO MAKE THIS WORK A LOT BETTER GOOD THANK YOU THANK. ANY OTHER COMMENTS. LET'S MOVE THE BILL THANK YOU. FOR A MOTION A SECOND SO MEMBER COOLEY ASSEMBLYMEMBER GRAYSON. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE.

OR TAX TREASURER COLLECTION MUST BE FIRST APPROVED BY A VOTE OF THE PEOPLE. VOTERS MUST BE ASKED THE QUESTION WHETHER THESE CONSOLIDATED POSITIONS WILL BE APPOINTED OR ELECTED AB TWENTY FIVE FIFTY EIGHT DOES NOT INTERFERE WITH THE BILL YOU THE BOARDS. OF SUPERVISORS AND FIND FIVE COUNTY SPECIFIED IN EXISTING LAW TO CONSOLIDATE ORDER CONTROLLER TAX TREASURER COLLECTOR AS AN ELECTED POSITION AND WILL SIMPLY PROVIDECONSISTENCY. ACROSS REMAINING CALIFORNIA VOTERS THE BILL ENSURES AT THE MONEY TAXPAYERS PUT IN THE HANDS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND MANAGED TO THE HIGHEST STANDARDS OF INTEGRITY. PROFESSIONAL AND IMPARTIALITY THANK YOU AND I RESPECT LAST SURVIVOR. WITNESSES TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS THE HONORABLE ERIC WOOLERY THE AUDITOR CONTROL OF ORANGE COUNTY AND THE HONORABLE KAREN ADAMS THE TAX TREASURER TAX COLLECTOR OF MERCED COUNTY. WELCOME TO HAVE. MADAM CHAIR MADAM VICE CHAIR IN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS ERIC WOOLERY I AM A CO SPONSOR A BABY TWENTY FIVE FIFTY EIGHT. AS THE INDEPENDENTLY ELECTED AUDITOR CONTROLLER POINTS COUNTY MY OFFICE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR EVALUATING ALL CLAIMS AND CHARGES SUBMITTED TO THE COUNTY. AND FOR ISSUING ALL COUNTY PAYMENTS. THE THREAT OF MAKING MY OFFICE APPOINTED AND THE THREAT OF REPEALING MY CONTROLLER FUNCTIONS SURFACED ON OCCASIONS WHEN I EXERCISE THE AUDITOR CONTROLLERS CHECK AND BALANCE DUTIES WITH REGARD TO THE ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. FOR INSTANCE MY OFFICE DELAYED PAYMENT ON HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN TAXPAYER FUNDED MAILERS THAT TWO MEMBERS OF THE ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS WANTED TO SEND TO THE VOTERS SHORTLY BEFORE THE TWENTY SIXTEEN ELECTIONS. I WANTED CLARENCE FROM THE F. PPC ON THESE MAILERS. THESE MAILERS ARE SO EGREGIOUS THAT THE LEGISLATURE YOU UNANIMOUSLY PASSED S. B. FORTY FIVE WHICH THE GOVERNOR SIGNED INTO LAW LAST YEAR. TO SEVERELY RESTRICT THESE MAILERS. AND ANOTHER INCIDENT AND SINCE MY OFFICE ATTEMPTED TO WITHHOLD A FOUR YEAR RETROACTIVE PENSION PAYMENT FOR A THIRD MEMBER OF THE ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. WHILE WE SOUGHT INFORMATION ON THE LEGALITY OF THIS PAYMENT. DURING BOTH OF THESE INSTANCES INCIDENTS I LEARNED THAT FROM MULTIPLE PEOPLE THAT MY. MAKING MY OFFICE APPOINTED OR REPEALING THE OFFICE FUNCTION WERE BOTH EXPLORED. AB TWENTY FIVE FIFTY A CLOSES THIS UNIQUE LOOPHOLE THAT ONLY APPLIES TO CONSOLIDATING THE APPOINTED DIRECTOR OF FINANCE THE ELECTED AUDITOR CONTROLLER AND THE ELECTED TREASURER TAX COLLECTOR. IN ALL SEVEN INSTANCES IN THE LAST THIRTY YEARS WHERE THESE TYPES OF. CONSOLIDATIONS WERE APPROVED. THE VOTERS WERE NOT GIVEN THE CHOICE AS WHETHER TO A CONSOLIDATED OFFICE SHOULD BE ELECTED OR APPOINTED. THERE IS NO OTHER COUNTY OFFICE IN WHICH EXISTING LAW ALLOWS AN APPOINTED OFFICE TO BE COMBINED WITH AN ELECTED OFFICE WITHOUT REQUIRING THE VOTERS TO DECIDE WHETHER THE OFFICES ELECTED OR APPOINTED. FOR EXAMPLE THE CLERK COUNTY CLERK CANNOT BE CONSOLIDATED WITH AN APPOINTED OFFICE AND LESS THE CONSOLIDATED OFFICE REMAINS ELECTED OR THE PEOPLE HAVE A SEPARATE VOTE TO MAKE THE. COUNTY CLERK APPOINTED. AB TWENTY FIVE FIFTY A DOES NOT ALTER EXISTING LAW REGARDING THE ABILITY OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS TO CONSOLIDATE ELECTED OFFICES WITH OTHER ELECTED OFFICES. THIS SIMPLY REQUIRES THAT IF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS WISHES TO CONSOLIDATE ELECTIVE OFFICES. WITH THE APPOINTED OFFICE OF DIRECTOR FINANCE THEN THE VOTERS MUST BE ABLE TO DECIDE WHETHER TO THE CONSOLIDATED OFFICE IS ELECTED OR APPOINTED. THE AUTO LA ALREADY REQUIRES THAT SWITCHING AN AUDITOR CONTROLLER FROM ELECTED TO APPOINTED REQUIRES A VOTE OF THE PEOPLE. AND IT HAS THE EXACT SAME REQUIREMENT FOR A TREASURER TAX COLLECTOR. AB TWENTY FIVE FIFTY EIGHT FIXES THE DIRECTOR OF FINANCE CONSOLIDATION LOOPHOLE THAT ALLOWS AN END RUN AROUND THIS REQUIREMENT. EXISTING LAW REQUIRES THAT IF A COUNTY WISHES TO HAVE A CONTROLLER FUNCTION IT MUST BE HELD BY THE AUDITOR. HOWEVER THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS CAN ABOLISH THE CONTROLLER FUNCTION BY A SIMPLE MAJORITY VOTE. AB TWENTY FIVE FIFTY EIGHT INSURES THAT THE CONTROLLER FUNCTION IS GOING TO BE ABOLISHED. FROM THE AUTHOR ELECTED AUDITOR CONTROLLER IT SHOULD ONLY BE DONE BY A VOTE OF THE PEOPLE OF THE COUNTY NOT MERELY BY THREE VOTES OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE COUNTY AUDITOR CONTROLLERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE ON AB TWENTY FIVE FIFTY EIGHT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M KAREN ADAMS. AND I'M PRIVILEGED TO BE OF THE MERCED COUNTY TREASURER TAX COLLECTOR HAVE SERVE FOR THE LAST SIXTEEN YEARS I'M HERE TO VOICE STRONG SUPPORT. FOR A BE TWENTY FIVE FIFTY EIGHT ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COUNTY TREASURERS AND TAX COLLECTORS. THIS MEASURE SUPPORTABLE FOR THREE IMPORTANT REASONS FIRST IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT VOTERS HAVE THE RIGHT TO DETERMINE IF IT IS IN THEIR BEST INTEREST TO LOOSEN ELECT A FOR EFFORT REPRESENTATIVE ONE WHO HAS DIRECT ACCOUNTABILITY TO THE TAXPAYERS. REDUCING THE NUMBER OF LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS SHOULD REQUIRE A VOTE THE ARGUMENT THE VOTERS HAVE THE RIGHT TO VOICE THEIR OBJECTION AT OPEN BOARD MEETING. FAILS TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT MANY VOTERS DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO FOLLOW THE PORTA SUPERVISORS CLOSELY ENOUGH. TO KNOW WHEN THEY ARE CONSOLIDATE CONSIDERING THE REMOVAL OF AN ELECTED OFFICE. AND TO CONSOLIDATE THAT POWER TO THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS VOTERS SHOULD GET A VOTE AND NOT JUST READ ABOUT IT PERHAPS AFTER THE FACT IN ADDITION VOICING A OBJECTION DOES NOT INSURE IN ACTION TO CONSOLIDATE. WILL NOT BE APPROVED AS ILLUSTRATED IN MY PERSONAL VOICE IN OBJECTION TO A CONSOLIDATION AS MY STATUS IS ELECTED TREASURER TAX COLLECTOR AND I OBJECTED AND OPEN BOARD MEETING AND REQUEST FULLY. THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS FOLLOWED WITH UNANIMOUS VOTE TO CONSOLIDATE THEIR FOR VOTE THAT OF VOICING OUR A OPPOSING. ARGUMENT DOES NOT PROVIDE AN ACTIVE A CLEAR STATEMENT FOR VOTERS ONLY AND ELECTION DOES THAT. SECOND AS TREASURE TAX COLLECTORS WE REALIZE THAT WE ARE NOT ALWAYS WELL KNOWN TO THE VOTERS WE WORK BEHIND THE SCENES PRUDENTLY INVESTING ALL COLLECTED COUNTY WIDE MONIES. IN ADDITION TO PROPERTY TAX DOLLARS AND MOST VOTERS TO NOT REALIZE THAT WE SERVE AS THEIR TAXPAYER ADVOCATE. AS A CURRENT EXAMPLE YOU MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH. WE'VE BEEN WORKING TO PROTECT TAXPAYERS STATEWIDE BY PUSHING FOR THE STRONGEST CONSUMER PROTECTION RELATED TO THE PACE INDUSTRY. IT WOULD BE MUCH MORE DIFFICULT FOR TAX COLLECTORS TO TAKE A PROMINENT ROLE IN THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE IF WE WERE ACCOUNTABLE TO BOARDS OF SUPERVISORS WHO HAVE BEEN ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE. OF THE PACE LEGISLATION IN RECENT HISTORY. FURTHER THE CONSOLIDATION TREASURER TAX COLLECTOR AN AUDITOR CONTROLLER WAS REVIEWED BY THE SENATE IN TWO THOUSAND TEN. AND IT WAS EVIDENT THAT AND IN COMPUTER INCOMPATIBILITY OF OFFICES DOES SO EXIST. BETWEEN THE AUDITOR AND TREASURER TAX COLLECTOR FUNCTIONS AS AN ELECTED OFFICIAL ENTRUSTED WITH THE TAXPAYERS MONEY MY ACTIONS MUST HAVE OVERSIGHT. AND A CONSOLIDATION OF THE AUDITOR CONTROLLER AND TREASURER TAX COLLECTOR OF WROTE THAT TAXPAYER PROTECTION. AS A RESULT CONSOLIDATIONS DO NOT SAVE MONEY BECAUSE OUTSIDE AUDITORS MUST BE HIGHER TO ENSURE TRANSPARENCY AND INTEGRITY IN THE OFFICE. AND FINAL AS A POINT OF PRIDE. AND AND THE MERCED COUNTY. EXCUSE ME AND FINALLY AS A POINT OF PRIDE COUNTY TREASURER TAX COLLECTORS HAVE BEEN DEFINES LOCAL STATE AND NATIONAL TO SYSTEM STATISTICS WHEN IT COMES TO GENDER PROFILE OF ELECTED OFFICE. IN CALIFORNIA WOMEN HOLD THE MAJORITY OF ELECTED COUNTY TREASURER TAX COLLECTORS AND WE ARE DATING PROUD OF IT. BUT WE'VE NOTED DURING RECENT CONSOLIDATIONS MEN HAVE REPLACED THE WOMEN THROUGH CONSOLIDATE ROLE AS AUDITOR. IN. AND IN THE MOST RECENT ATTEMPTS TO CONSOLIDATE THE TWO WOMEN THAT WERE BEING CONSIDERED FOR CONSOLIDATION. AT VERY A THEIR AUDITORS WERE NOT SO THEREFORE THERE'S ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY. WHEN GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY RUN GRAMMAR WOMEN HAVE A HIGHER SUCCESS BEING ELECTED TREASURER TAX COLLECTOR IN WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO ENSURE THAT OPPORTUNITY. AND FINALLY CLOSING AS A PROUD PAST PRESENT A MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COUNTY TREASURERS AND TAX COLLECTORS. I URGE YOU TO PRESERVE THE RIGHT TO THE VOTERS TO DETERMINE WHAT'S BEST IN THEIR LOCAL GOVERNMENT THROUGH THEIR BALLOT BOX. ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY FIVE FIFTY EIGHT IS BEST FOR VOTERS AND TAXPAYERS AND IT WILL SEND A STRONG MESSAGE THAT WE ARE ALL. COMMITTED TO PROTECTING THE REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY I URGE YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. TOUGH ONE TO FOLLOW. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS NOTS I REALLY HAVE THE STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTY AUDITOR'S OUGHT TO ALL THE COMMENTS MADE EARLIER ENERGY SUPPORT THANK YOU. I'M BRIDGET HEAVILY ON THE OTHER TO CONTROL FOR YUBA COUNTY AND I WANNA ECHO MY SUPPORT FOR THE OF THE COMMENTS HERE AND URGE SUPPORTING THE BILL THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON JEFF BERGMAN TURKEY I ARE CONTROLLING HERE'S FOR THE BILL THINKING. HELLO I'M REBEKAH CALLAN AUDITOR CONTROLLER FOR THE COUNTY OF CALAVERAS AND I URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL. WITNESSES OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS DURING THE JOHNSON OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES AND ALSO BEHALF MY COLLEAGUE WITH THE ROLE COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA. AYE WE DO RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THIS MEASURE WE FEEL UNDERMINES THE GIVEN AUTHORITY TO THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS TO MAKE DECISIONS WHERE GREATER EFFICIENCY CAN BE ACHIEVED IN THIS IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT IN OUR RURAL COUNTIES. YOU KNOW I I WANT TO TAKE A STEP BACK TO LOOK AT THE BIGGER PICTURE. ABOUT THE CHANGE OF THESE NON CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICERS THESE IS ONE OF MANY LEGISLATIVE ATTEMPTS WE'VE SEEN. I TO ESTABLISH GREATER AUTHORITY FOR NON CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICERS TO MAKE THEM. MORE LIKE THE SHERIFF THE ASSESSOR THE DA AND OTHERS WHO'VE GONE TO THE VOTERS. AND A HOLISTIC WAY TO ASK SHOULD ALL OF THESE AUTHORITIES BE GRANTED TO THIS OFFICE AND WE WOODS RESPECTFULLY SUGGEST THAT THAT WOULD BE A MORE APPROPRIATE WAY TO ENGAGE WITH THE VOTERS. IF THEIR OPINION IS SO SOUGHT AND I JUST WANT TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF VOTER ENGAGEMENT ON THIS SPECIFIC CONSOLIDATION. CURRENT LAW ALREADY DOES PROVIDE FOR VOTER ENGAGEMENT THEY CAN. ISSUE ARE THEY CAN SEEK A REFERENDUM TO UNDO THE ACTION OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IF THEY DISAGREE WITH THE CONSOLIDATION OF OFFICES SO. FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THE BILL THANK YOU. JOHN FORSYTHE URBAN COUNTIES OF CALIFORNIA ALSO I RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION I WOULD POINT OUT THAT. ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS THAT THE COUNTIES HAVE THIS FLEXIBILITY IN THIS AUTHORITY IS DURING ROUGH TIMES DURING THE RECESSION WE REALLY HAD A. YOU KNOW CONSOLIDATE AND THINK ABOUT HOW TO MAKE THE MOST EFFICIENT SERVICES SO WE JUST. RESPECTFULLY BELIEVE THAT IT SHOULD BE OUT AND WITHIN THE PATROL THE BORDER SUPERVISORS BECAUSE TIMES CHANGE THINGS CHANGE ISSUES CHANGIN SHOULD BE DONE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. VICTORY OPPOSE. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SING MOTHERING COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SEEING NONE WE HAVE A MOTION BY THE. BECAUSE A FACILITY RECOVERY ARROW AND SECOND BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER WATER IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION YEAH I JUST I IT IT'S NOT A QUESTION I THINK IT'S JUST THAT A COMMENT AND. HAVE IN IT YOU KNOW I'M I'M A BIG. BELIEVER IN LOCAL CONTROL AND A BIG BELIEVER IN. AND HAVING DELEGATING THAT AUTHORITY DOUBTS AND MOST OF US COME FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT SO I KNOW WE FEEL THE SAME WAY. BUT. BUT THE IT THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT AND IN HERE'S THE REASON IS THAT THE AUDITORS HAVE A REAL DIFFERENT FUNCTION. OUGHT THEN THE CONTROLLERS ANDAND THERE'S ME THE AUDITOR CONTROLLER TREASURE. CAN BE SEPARATE THINGS THAT LOOK AT DIFFERENT. THEY HAVE DIFFERENT RESPONSIBILITIES AND. I HAD I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO A REALLY TALKED TALKIN DAMP DEPTH TO MY LOCAL. MY LOCALS AND. THEY THERE'S SOMETHING DO SHARE RESPONSIBILITIES THAT ARE REALLY INDEPENDENT FROM THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND. I'M SO ANYWAY I I JUST THINK THAT. THAT THIS IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT SITUATION AND. I UNDERSTAND WHAT. IF I WAS SITTING AT THAT COUNTY BOARDS WHO FOR IT VISOR I MIGHT THINK LET ME MAKE THE DECISIONS ON YOU KNOW WHAT I SHOULD CONSOLIDATE WHAT WHEN I SHOULDN'T BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT. ARE THERE THESE DUTIES ARE SO DIFFERENT AND SO INDEPENDENT THAT YEAH IT REALLY REQUIRES AT. AS TO PROTECT THEM AND TO SET THEM UP SO THAT IF IN FACT THERE'S A CONSOLIDATION THAT'S NECESSARY GOTOVO TO THE PUBLIC. THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM MANY. A CASE OF A JUDGE CLOSE. REGISTER THANKS FOR THIS QUESTION I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY THIS BILL IN THIS IS THAT I THINK ASSEMBLY WOMAN CALL THE ARROW HIT ON THE HEAD THIS IS DIFFERENT AND YOU HAVE A SITUATION WHERE AN AUDITOR MAY BE LOOKING AT A. A BORDER SUPERVISOR ACTION AND FIND SOMETHING AND WE FOUND AN ORANGE COUNTY THAT. OUR AUDITOR HAD TO USE COUNTY COUNCIL. AND COUNTY COUNCILS HARD BY THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS HE COULD NOT GET HIS OWN. ANNA COUNTY COUNCIL TO LOOK INTO THESE TO THESE ISSUES AND. YOU KNOW THAT THE COUNTY ATTORNEY'S BEHOLDEN TO THE BOARD SUPRISING HIRAM SO ON TO INSURE THEIR INDEPENDENCE AND. THEIR FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY TO OF THE TAXPAYERS THAT'S THE REASON WE RAN THIS BILL AND I RESPECT PLEASURABLE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I WILL BE IN SUPPORT OF YOUR BILL FOR ALL THOSE REASONS. SECRETARY CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS TO PASS AGUIAR-CURRY AGUIAR-CURRY AYE WALDRON. WALDRON AYE BLOOM. BLOOM I CABALLERO CABALLERO AYE COOLEY. COOLEY AYE GRAYSON GRAYSON AYE LACKEY.

FROM BEING ACCOMPANIED BY A PERSON WITH A POTENTIAL FINANCIAL INTEREST IN THE OUTCOME OF THE INSPECTION. A WHEN INSPECTING A COMMERCIAL PROPERTY OR BUSINESS ARE FULL COMPLIANCE WITH THE STATE STATUTE REGULATION OR LOCAL ORDINANCE. BUSINESSES. TYPICALLY GO THROUGH CODE ENFORCEMENT INSPECTIONS TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE SAFE HABITABLE AND HEALTHY PLACES FOR THE PUBLIC. A LOCAL GOVERNMENT CODE ENFORCEMENT OFFICER ALL HEALTH OFFICER WILL INSPECT A BUSINESS AND ISSUE CITATIONS FOR ANYTHING THAT IS NOT UP TO PROPER SAFETY LEVELS. THE BUSINESS MUST AND FIX ANY SITE ARE CITED ISSUES IN ORDER TO RECEIVE A PERMIT TO OPERATE. IN DECEMBER OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND ETHNIC NEWSPAPER IN MY DISTRICT GOT DETAILED A SITUATION WHERE THE CODE ENFORCEMENT OFFICER WHILE CONDUCTING. OUR INSPECTION OF AN AUTO BODY FACTORY WAS A COMPANY THANK YOU BY THIRD PARTY CONTRACTOR WHO OPERATED THE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION BUSINESS. UPRIGHT AGAINST BUT THE INSPECTION THE BUSINESS OWNER PREVIOUSLY HAD AN ARCHITECT DESIGN THE PLANS FOR THE RENOVATION TO BE CONSISTENT WITH THE CITY'S COATS. HOWEVER THE CODE ENFORCEMENT OFFICER CITED A NUMBER OF ISSUES WITH THE BUSINESS AND THE ARCHITECTURAL PLAN AND REQUIRED THE BUSINESS OWNER TO FIX THEM. AFTER THE INSPECTION WAS COMPLETED THE AND THE CODE ENFORCEMENT OFFICER LEFT THE PREMISES. OF THE OWNER HAT WAS APPROACH BY THE CONTRACTOR WHO STAYED BEHIND AND OFFER TO REDESIGN AND CONSTRUCT THE PROJECT FOR THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. THE BUSINESS OWNER WAS QUOTED TO PAY ONLY TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS BY THE INITIAL ARCHITECT. THE BUSINESS OWNER ULTIMATELY PAID THE CONTRACTOR HOOKED WHO ACCOMPANIED THE CODE ENFORCEMENT OFFICER OUT OF FEAR THAT NOT DOING SO WOULD RESULT IN DELAYS TO HAVING THE PERMIT APPROVED. THE BUSINESS OWNER SUSPECTED. I BEING THE SUBJECT OF A SCHEME WHEREBY THE CONTRACTOR AND ACTION THIS BILL. AB TWENTY FOUR EIGHTY FIVE LIMITS OF SITUATIONS THAT WOULD ALLOW LOCAL GOVERNMENT CODE ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS WILL HEALTH OFFICERS FROM BEING ACCOMPANIED.

THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SAYING NOTHING QUESTIONS OF THE. COMMITTEE. YES ABSOLUTELY. YEAH I I HAVE A QUESTION BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THIS IS ALREADY ILLEGAL CONDUCT. IT'S A. IT'S A. A CONFLICT OF INTEREST AND. AND AND SHOULD BE. IT. IF. I'M I BELIEVE IT'S HAPPENING BUT I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY WE NEED TO MAKE IT. A LAW. IF IT'S ALREADY ILLEGAL CONDUCT SURE ARE THANKS FOR THE QUESTION OF PRIOR TO. THE INTRODUCTION OF THE BILL IN FACT WE HAD LET'S COUNCIL AND ALSO. OF THE LEAGUE OF CITIES TO LOOK INTO THIS THE POLITICAL SITUATION TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT EXISTING LAW ALREADY COVERED THIS SITUATION. THEY ALL CAME UP AND EMPTY SURPRISINGLY ENOUGH. AND OUT YOU KNOW YOU COULD POP ACTUALLY ARE ARGUE THAT THIS IS WITHIN THE REALM OF FAR A FRAUD A MISREPRESENTATION NO CORRUPTION CASES BUT BUT WE LOOKED IN THERE'S NOTHING IN IT ON THE BOOKS THAT THAT WOULD COVER THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION. ODD YOU KNOW I'VE ALSO HEARD PERSONALLY AND OTHER SITUATION ARE THAT HAPPEN IN MY DISTRICT THIS COULD BE A SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS TO PRO PROBABLY PRIMARILY TO THE ETHNIC COMMUNITIES. ALL AS WELL. IN MANY OF THESE CASES THE THE THE THE BUSINESS OWNERS ARE NOT WILLING TO STEP FORWARD TO TESTIFY THAT'S ONE OF THE DIFFICULTIES. AND. AN ENDLESS WARS FRAUD SINCE AND I ALSO DID A LITTLE RESEARCH ON THAT THAT THE THE A CAUSE OF ACTION FOR FRAUD ACTUALLY HAS FIVE ELEMENTS FOR EXAMPLE FALSE MET MS REPETITION OF OF MATERIAL FACT. KNOWLEDGE OF FALSITY AND INTEND TO RECEIVE REASONABLE RELIANCE BY INNOCENT PARTY OR LOSS SUFFERED BY THE PARTY STILL A FRAUD MAY MAY NOT TO A POTENTIALLY COVERED THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION. THAT WE HAVE ON HAND AND THIS IS HAPPENING A THREE I ACTUALLY THROUGHOUT MY DISTRICT SAID SO THAT'S WHY WE ARE INTRODUCED A BILL. YES. AND DOES THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD BECAUSE IT IS FRUSTRATING. WHEN YOU HAVE SOMEONE THAT'S DOING INSPECTION WHO IS ALSO QUALIFIED. AND VERY WELL MAY BE THE ONE DOING THE WORK AND I SAY THIS FROM EXPERIENCE HAS AS A KIND GENTLE CONTRACTOR. AND THE WAY THE LOOPHOLE THE WAY THEY'RE GETTING AWAY FROM IT BEING FRAUD OR ILLEGAL ACTIVITY. IS BY THE CONTRACTOR STICKING AROUND AFTERWARD PUTTING ON THE DIFFERENT HAT NO LONGER BEING A PART OF THE INSPECTION BUT NOW BEING A PART OF THE SOLUTION ALTHOUGH. THAT PERSON IS A PART OF BOTH AND SO BY SEPARATE BY DRAWING IN DELINEATING BETWEEN THE INSPECTION VERSES THE. ACTUAL CONTRACTING ON THE WORK THAT'S THE LEUPOLD SO. THIS BILL WOULD HELP CLARIFY THAT IF YOU'RE A PART OF ONE YOU CAN'T BE THE OTHER. AND THAT'S JUST UP TO ME WOULD BE COMMONSENSE SO THANK YOU FOR THE BILL THANK YOU FOR COMMENTS AS WELL. ANY OTHER.

AS OF JANUARY FIRST OF THIS YEAR CANNABIS IS NOW LEGAL IN CALIFORNIA FOR MEDICAL USE AS WELL AS ADULT USE. OVER THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE. WE ARE SETTING IN PLACE A REGULATORY STRUCTURE. ON THIS BUSINESS AS WE DO SO THERE ARE CHALLENGES ENTERS FOLKS WHO WON OPERATE OUTSIDE THE LAW. A JUST YESTERDAY MORNING I WAS SITTING WITH RANCHERA COPS TALKING ABOUT HOW THEY SEE THE IMPLEMENTATION. CANNABIS IN THE CITY OF RANCHO CORDOVA THEY SEE ILLEGAL GROWS. IT HAS A REGULATORY CHALLENGES A LAW ENFORCEMENT CHALLENGE. AND. A STATISTIC HERE OUR OUR SHARES DEPARTMENT HAVE HAD HUNDREDS OF CALLS IN THE LAST YEAR DEALING WITH.

THANK YOU AND MANY CHAIR MEMBER GOOD AFTERNOON LUCIA MUCH LARA BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION I'LL AT THE SPONSORS OF AB TWENTY ONE SIXTY FOUR A ONE I THINK ASSEMBLYMEMBER COOLEY FOR. AUTHORING THIS LEGISLATION WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF AND THE COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH OUR ASSOCIATION TO NARROW THE FOCUS ON THE BILL ON ILLEGAL CULTIVATION OF CANNABIS. AND WE ALSO WANT TO THINK ABOUT THE OPPOSITION WHO HAVE THAT REACHED OUT TO US. AND OUT WE HAD DISCUSSED ARE CONCERNED ENOUGH KNOWLEDGE THAT ON SEE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY KNOW THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO DIALOGUE WITH THEM TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR. OPPOSITION AND OTHER CONCERNS GET. REMOVED UMPIRED AT TO DISPEL MOVING FORWARD TO THE FLOOR I'M SO WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THINK YOUR OTHER OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. SING NINE OPPOSITE THAT ANY WITNESSES OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS A DEBRA CARLTO WITH THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION A YOU KNOW WE AGREE WITH THE APPROACH THAT WE CERTAINLY HAVE NO PROBLEM IF YOU WISH TO PROCEED AGAINST TENANTS IN PARTICULAR. MANY OF OUR OWNERS I WOULD SAY OLIVER OWNERS. HAVE PROHIBITED THROUGH THEIR LEASES I CANNABIS GROW AND WE HAD WORKED WITH. LEGISLATORS WHEN THIS INITIATIVE WAS MOVE FORWARD AT THE STATE LEVEL WHAT WE HAVE PROPOSED IS SOMETHING WE BELIEVE TO BE VERY REASONABLE SIMPLY KEEP THE EXISTING STE OF LAW IN PLACE AS IT PERTAINS TO. PROPERTY OWNERS GIVE THEM THE RIGHT TO APPEAL. SO YOU DON'T CHANGE THE LAWS THAT PERTAINS TO THEIR RIGHT TO. SHOULD DEMONSTRATE THAT THEY HAD NO KNOWLEDGE AND DEMONSTRATE THAT THEY HAVE IN FACT PROHIBITED THAT ACTIVITY YOU CAN STILL PROCEED WITH THE CHANGES AS A PROPOSED BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER COOLEY AGAINST THOSE WHO ARE ACTUALLY. VIOLATING THE STATUTE SO THAT'S I BELIEVE TO BE A REASONABLE APPROACH A TO MOVING FORWARD AND WE WOULD REQUEST OF THOSE AMENDMENTS A BE CONSIDERED BEFORE YOU VOTE. ON THE BILL. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS MET THE HEART WITH THE CALIFORNIA BUSINESS PROPERTIES ASSOCIATION I WOULD ECHO THE COMMENTS OF DEBORAH. ON THE COMMERCIAL SIDE THEIR SEVENTY TWO DIFFERENT WAYS THAT YOU CAN DO A COMMERCIAL LEASE. YEAH UNDERWAY THAT THIS BILL IS CURRENTLY WRITTEN. IT WOULD PUT SOME OF THE ONUS ON A LANDLORD PROPERTY OWNER TO BE PICKING THROUGH YOUR WINDOWS TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE NOT DOING ILLEGAL ACTIVITY THAT'S NOT THE. THAT'S NOT SOMETHING A POSITION OUR OUR OWNERS WANT TO BE IN OUR PROPERTY MANAGERS AND WE WOULD JUST TAX THAT THERE IS A AT LEAST THAT THE LANGUAGE IN THERE SO WE CAN THERE CAN BE AN APPEALS PROCESS. OR SOMETHING IN THE LAW THAT RECOGNIZES THAT THAT. LANDLORDS AREN'T SUPPOSED TO BE POLICING THEIR TENANTS IN THIS MANNER. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES OPPOSITION. A GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS ARE CREAM GREASY ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS A WE ARE CURRENTLY IN NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE AUTHOR AND THE AUTHOR STAFF. AND WERE SEEKING A PROPOSED AMENDMENT. THAT WOULD ENSURE THAT. FINES AND PENALTIES ON RENTAL PROPERTIES RELATED CANNABIS CULTIVATION ARE LEVIED ON THE ACTUAL TEN INTO IS LEASING THE PROPERTY AND NOT PROPERTY OWNER. AND. WE'RE SEEING THIS AMENDMENT US SO THAT IT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE SPIRIT OF THE. RENTAL PROPERTY UNDER PROTECTIONS THAT WERE PUT INTO PLACE BY THE. CANNABIS A LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE THAT WAS PASSED IN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND SO WE'RE CONFIDENT WE'LL BE ABLE TO REACH AN AGREEMENT JUST WANT TO TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO THINK THE AUTHOR FOR WORKING WITH US THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. SO LISTENING QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE. YES. S. SUMMER PEREIRO. CONFIGURING MUCH SO I APPRECIATE. WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO WITH? THIS BILL MISTER COOLEY AYE. I HAD. IT'S ACTUALLY THE COMBINATION OF OF A NUMBER OF COMMENTS. BECAUSE WHEN I WAS READING IT WASN'T CLEAR TO ME THAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT COMMERCIAL CULTIVATION AS OPPOSED TO THE LEGAL CULTIVATION THAT'S PERMITTED. UNDER THE LAW. AND. IN IT AND SO IT AND PART OF WHAT I WAS STRUGGLING WITH IS HOW WOULD YOU KNOW THAT SOMEONE'S GROWING. MARIJUANA. OTHER THAN PICKING THROUGH THE WINDOWS. ATE IT IT BE THERE'S USUALLY IF THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE GETS INFORMATION JUST USUALLY A TIP. OR OR ITS SOMETHING THAT SOMEONE HAS TOLD THEM OR THEY THERE IN A PLACE WHERE THEY'RE. THEY'RE ENTITLED TO BE IN THE SEA IT BUT. I WAS JUST STRUGGLING WITH HOW HOW SO SO ONE IS I DO BELIEVE THE RENTER SHOULD PAY THE FINE. AYE AYE I BELIEVE THERE NEEDS TO BE. A DIVERT DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN THE PLANTS THE NUMBER OF PLANTS THAT ARE ALLOWED TO BE GROWN. UNDER PERSONALLY USE BY LAW AND I DON'T REMEMBER WHAT THAT NUMBER IS ANYMORE SIX SIX. AND. AND THAT IS EXCLUDED FROM THAT FROM FROM THIS. KIND OF OF OF CHANGE I GUESS IS IS THE BEST WAY TO PUT IT. MY THOSE ARE THE TWO WELL I THINK THE EMPHASIS. I WILL WORK WITH ALL THE FOLKS TO MAKE SURE HIS FOCUS ON ILLEGAL GROWS. SO THAT EXCLUDES A LOT OF. YOU KNOW THE ALLOWABLE. CULTIVATION. SO I GUESS I'D SAY I WILL CONTINUE WORK WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS I THINK I UNDERSTAND TO BE A LANDLORD DIDN'T WANT TO BE. COLLATERAL INVOLVED IN THIS ONE IT'S THE MAN. YOU GOTTA MALEFACTORS OF SOME SORT. WE DON'T INTEND TO ADDRESS LEGAL CULTIVATION. AND A. ILLEGAL GROWS COME TO LIGHT IN VARIOUS WAYS UNUSUAL POWER BILLS RIGHT HA THAT THE ILLEGAL GROWS I DON'T HAVE A PROCESS SO LOWER FOCUSING ON HERE ACTUALLY IS ON THESE ILLEGAL GROWS WHICH COME TO LIGHT HOWEVER THEY COME TO LIFE RIGHT. THEY COME TO LIGHT TODAY. AND JUST ALLOW THE ENFORCEMENT ACTION TO HAPPEN IMMEDIATELY WHEN YOU HAVE IN THE LEGAL GROVE CANNABIS. AND. SO I GUESS I WILL. BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE APARTMENTS FOR SHE IS REALTORS AND OTHERS POSSESS PROPERTY FOLKS. AND OF JUST LOOK AT BILL LANGUAGE TO ADDRESS. THEIR CONCERNS I APPRECIATE THAT I DEAFENED WILL DO THAT. SO MEMBERS YEAH I TO AS WELL APPRECIATE WHAT. THE INTENT OF THE BILL AS I JUST EXPRESSING THE CONCERNS AS WELL. AS MAKING SURE THERE'S A DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN PROPERTY OWNERS VERSUS THE LANDLORD WHO'S ACTUALLY THE ONE VIOLATING THE LAW. AND MAKING SURE THAT THE THE PROPERTY OWNER HAS AWAY. MY JUST A MINUTE. RIGHT BUT NOT THAT SERVE THE LANDLORD VIOLATED THE LAW THE TENET IS TO ONE CORRECT THE TENANT VIOLATING THE LAW AND THEN THE THE LANDLORD AT. WOULD HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAL AND MAKE SURE AND GET YOU RT'S STATE IF YOU CAN WORK WITH OPPOSITION IS OPPOSITION OKAY WITH. THE AUTHORS COMMITMENT. YEAH ABSOLUTELY PERFECT THEM WERE HAPPY TOGETHER YEAH BUT NOT. OKAY ASSEMBLY MEMBER. LACKEY. YES MA'AM THANK YOU AND. I JUST WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE AND I I KNOW HIM WELL ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT HE WILL WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION. BECAUSE I KNOW THAT. THEIR CONCERNS HE SHARES. AND SO WE SHOULD KNOW THAT. RIGHT NOW WE GOT THE THE REVENUE. REPORT JUST RECENTLY CAME MEN. AND. THE INCOME THAT WAS PROJECTED. VERSUS WHAT WE ACTUALLY RECEIVED FROM CANNABIS WAS ABOUT A THEFT. AND IT'S NOT BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE QUIT SMOKING MARIJUANA. IT'S BIG OR USING IN ANY FASHION BY THE WAY. IT'S BECAUSE ILLICIT MARKET AS JUST. KICK IN THE TAIL OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO PLAY BY THE RULES. SO WE NEED TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO FORTIFY THOSE WHO ARE. PLAYING BY THE RULES AND BE VERY VERY SHE. STRINGENT AGAINST THOSE WHO ARE NOT THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS. OKAY WE HAVE A MOTION OSUNA ASSEMBLY MEMBER WALDRON LIFE'S HARD THANK YOU KNOW I THINK A LOT OF WHAT I WAS GOING TO ASK AS WE SAID BECAUSE I REALLY STRUGGLED WITH THIS BILL BECAUSE. I SEE YOU KNOW THIS. I UNDERSTAND WHAT THE FOLKS IN SUPPORT OF SAYING I AM THE SAME WITH THE FOLKS IN OPPOSITION ARE SAYING. AND YOU KNOW WHEN I LOOK AT IT AND IT'S TIED TO. A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT IT WOULD HAVE TO BE TIED TO SOMETHING IN THE BUILDING IN THE PLUMBING ELECTRICAL OR OTHER THAN THAT COULD. INCREASE THE FEES THAT HER ALSO GOING TO BE FIND AND I'M THINKING. WELL IF THE LANDLORD KNOWS OF ONE POINT OR THE LAND LOW LORD KNOWS AT A LATER TIME IT'S STILL THE SAME OUTCOME BECAUSE THE TENANTS MOVE. SO YEARS OLD WHAT'S HAPPENING IS. YOU'RE FINDING THE PROPERTY OWNER AND. FIVE I KIND OF THE STRUGGLING WITH THAT PART OF IT BECAUSE AND THE QUESTION I HAD WAS. AS AS OF APARTMENT DEPARTMENT ASSOCIATION WHEN WOULD LANDLORD EVEN KNOW THERE WAS. I MEAN WHO WOULD INFORM THEM LAW ENFORCEMENT OR HEAD OF THE. KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT WE USUALLY KNOW IF LAW ENFORCEMENT TELLS US BUT THE LEGISLATURE'S BEEN VERY CLEAR THAT TENANTS HAVE A RIGHT TO PRIVACY WE HAVE NO RIGHT TO PROACTIVELY INSPECT. ANTENNAS ALL THE TIME TELL US NO YOU CAN'T. YOU KNOW THEY WANT THEIR RIGHT TO PRIVACY NOT JUST BECAUSE THERE'S MORE ACTIVITY SO WE DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT TO DO THAT WE WOULD ONLY KNOW. IF WE HAD A CLAIM. WERE SHERIFFS OR EVEN TENANTS IT TURNS ROUND EACH OTHER ALL THE TIME FOR THINGS THAT ARE NOT NECESSARILY ILLEGAL BUT YOU KNOW THERE MATCH OTHER SO WE HAVE TO BE. SENSITIVE THERE TOO. SO USUALLY I WE DO NOW IS WHEN. THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS TOLD. BECAUSE IT HAS ALSO PAY THEIR OWN UTILITY BILLS SO WE DON'T SEE I CAN UTILITIES BECAUSE WE DON'T SEE THAT HE HAD A MASTER METER SITUATION MAY BE SOME WHO WOULD COME TO LIGHT BUT I DON'T THINK YOU ASSUME THAT THAT'S.

PRESENTING A. B. TWO THREE TWO NINE ON BEHALF OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER OBERNOLTE. AND. I'D LIKE TO START BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS ON PAGE TWO OF THE ANALYSIS ON BEHALF OF MISTER OBERNOLTE. AND AB TWENTY THREE TWENTY NINE ALLOWS PARITY FOR COMPENSATION. FOR BOARD MEMBERS OF VARIOUS SPECIAL DISTRICTS CURRENT LAW ALLOWS MOST SPECIAL DISTRICTS TO MEET UP TO SIX TIMES A MONTH IF NEEDED. BUT CURRENT LAW ALSO ALLOWS MOST SPECIAL DISTRICTS TO ADOPT AN ORDINANCE TO RAISE THE COMPENSATION BY A MAXIMUM OF FIVE PERCENT A YEAR. HOWEVER SOME SPECIAL DISTRICTS HAVE A LOWER CAP. ON MEETINGS OR DO NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO RAISE THEIR COMPENSATION PUTTING THEM AT A DISADVANTAGE. AB TWENTY THREE TWENTY NINE WILL SOLVE THIS INEQUITY BY BRINGING A HANDFUL OF TYPES OF SPECIAL DISTRICTS UP TO PAR BY ALLOWING THEM TO MEET UP TO SIX TIMES A MONTH. AND ALLOWING THEM THE AUTHORITY TO RAISE THEIR COMPENSATION. AND OF THESE OR SIMPLY ALLOWANCES AND THAT LEAVE THE DECISIONS LOCAL BOARDS TO KNOW WHAT IS BEST FOR THEIR COMMUNITY. AND WITH ME TODAY IN SUPPORT IS DILLON GIBBONS FROM THE CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION. FEEL FREE TO START HER. CHAIR MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE DELEGATE IS WITH THE CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. AS IS MENTIONED MANY OF OUR SPECIAL DISTRICTS RECEIVE A MODEST COMPENSATION FOR DOING THE BUSINESS OF THEIR DISTRICTS. ATTENDING MEETINGS. VARIOUS HEARINGS. HOWEVER THAT COMPENSATION VARIES WIDELY FROM DISTRICT TO DISTRICT AND AB TWENTY THREE TWENTY NINE. BRING SOME UNIFORMITY TO NUMBER OF THOSE DISTRICTS. AT WHILE ALSO MAINTAINING THE LOCAL FLEXIBILITY FOR DISTRICTS TO MAKE A DECISION ON WHETHER OR NOT THEY INCREASE THAT COMPENSATION ANNUALLY. THE NUMBER OF MEETINGS THAT THEY WILL ACTUALLY HOLD. AND MAKE THAT DETERMINATION OF WHETHER OR NOT IT'S NECESSARY OR JUSTIFIED. SO WITH THAT I WOULD ASK IN URGE FOR YOUR SUPPORT THE BILL. THANK YOU OTHER OTHERS AT A WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. SEEING NONE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ANY COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. A SUMMER RECOVERY OF THE SIX REALLY HOW YOU KNOW. YEAH YOU KNOW WHAT I AM I'M GONNA SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY BUT FRANKLY.

THEY WERE LONG MEETINGS BUT YOU GOT IT DONE I I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH INCREASE IT INCREASING THE FEES I JUST MUCH RATHER JUST SAY INCREASE THE FEES RATHER THAN INCREASE THE NUMBER OF MEETINGS.

IF CHAIR FIVE TO FIVE A RESPONSE IF. AND. I WOULD I WOULD AGREE WITH THAT STATEMENT A PERCENT.
