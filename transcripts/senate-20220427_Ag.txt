SO GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO START BY A SEVENTEEN THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS NOTED IN THE BILL ANALYSIS I ALSO LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH MY OFFICE ON THESE AMEND. AS THE GLOBAL EVENTS HAVE SHOWN HOW INTERCONNECTED WE ARE AND HAS HIGHLIGHTED THE IMPORTANCE OF UNDERSTANDING EXACTLY. WAS IN CONTROL OF THE RESOURCES WE DEPEND ON INCLUDING OUR OWN. THE. INCLUDING GLOBAL PHYSICAL SECURITY AS WELL AS FOOD SECURITY. THERE ARE LOOMING CONCERNS THAT THE CONFLICT IN UKRAINE COULD DRAMATICALLY INCREASE FOOD INSECURITY PARTICULARLY FOR NATIONS IN NEED RUSSIA PRODUCED 30% OF THE WORLD'S WITH SUPPLY 20% OF ITS CORN SUPPLY AND SEVENTY FIVE. UP SEED OIL. THE WORLD FOOD PROGRAM BUYS 50% OF ITS GRAIN FROM UKRAINE. CALIFORNIA'S AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY PRODUCES ONE THIRD OF OUR COUNTRY'S VEGETABLES ANDTWO THIRDS OF OUR COUNTRY'S FRUITS AND NUTS AND ALSO PROVIDES FOOD TO THOSE IN NEED ALL OVER THE WORLD. ON AVERAGE 40% OF CALIFORNIA'S AGRICULTURAL OUTPUT IS EXPORTED GLOBALLY. THE AGRICULTURAL LAND TO PRODUCE THESE CROPS IS INVALUABLE TO OUR STATE GDP. AS WELL AS TO FEEDING THE STATE IN THE NATION. AND THE PAST FEW YEARS. FOREIGN OWNERSHIP OF CALIFORNIA'S AGRICULTURAL LAND TESTED LEE INCREASED. BETWEEN TWENTY NINETEEN TO TWENTY TWENTY FOREIGN OWNERS PURCHASED OVER FORTY THOUSAND ACRES OF AGRICULTURAL LAND IN CALIFORNIA SPECIFICALLY. A LITTLE OVER A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND ACRES HAVE. A OF AGRICULTURAL LAND IS HELD IN FOREIGN OWNERSHIP. THE LAND PURCHASES BUT CALIFORNIA'S POTENTIALLY CALIFORNIA'S FOR SECURITY AT RISK EXTENDING NOT ONLY TO DOMESTIC YOUTH BUT ALSO TO OUR EXPORTS. IN TWENTY NINETEEN CALIFORNIA'S AGRICULTURAL EXPORTS WERE MEASURED AT TWENTY ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION IN VALUE. SB TEN EIGHTY FOUR PREVENTS FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS FROM PURCHASING AGRICULTURAL LAND IN CALIFORNIA FOUR DIRECTS THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE TO COMPILE AN ANNUAL REPORT HIGHLIGHTING VARIOUS TRENDS RELATING TO FOREIGN OWNERSHIP ON AGRICULTURAL LAND. RIGHT THIRTY FACILITIES ENERGY FACILITIES. THIS WILL ENSURE CALIFORNIA HAS UP TO DATE INFORMATION O TRENDS ON FOREIGN OWNERSHIP OF MANY OF CALIFORNIA'S IMPORTANT RESOURCES NUMEROUS OTHER STATES HAVE LAWS WITH VARIOUS LEVELS OF RESTRICTIONS AND PROHIBITIONS AROUND. ALL FOREIGN OWNERSHIP OF AGRICULTURAL LAND. IOWA FOR EXAMPLE PROHIBITS FOREIGN RESIDENTS BUSINESSES AND GOVERNMENTS FROM OWNING AGRICULTURAL LAND. MISSISSIPPI PROHIBITS FOREIGN NON RESIDENTS FROM ALL OWNERSHIP OF AGRICULTURAL LAND. WHY LIMITS SHOULD TO THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN A RESIDENT OF THE STATE FOR AT LEAST THREE YEARS. MINNESOTA LIMITS OWNERSHIP OF AGRICULTURAL LAND TO CITIZENS AND PERMANENT RESIDENTS WITH LIMITS PLACED ON THE LAND OWNED BY PERMANENT RESIDENTS. THE LAWS AND IN THE STATE'S SHOW CALIFORNIA WOULD BY NO MEANS BE THE FIRST STATE TO ENACT THIS TYPE OF RESTRICTION ON FOREIGN OWNERSHIP OF AGRICULTURAL LAND. ACTUALLY BUT OF DISCUSSION- GIVEN THIS IS A CONCERN THAT IS GROWING ACROSS THE NATION. ARE THAT- THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF THE ONLY STATES THAT ACTUALLY HAS. JYJ AGRICULTURE OUTPUT THAT DOES NOT HAVE ANY KIND OF. LOVE THE SPORT. SO SB TEN EIGHTY FOUR TOOK THE CRUCIAL STEPS IT TAKES A CRUCIAL STEP TOWARDS PROTECTING OUR FOOD SECURITY BY CREATING A RESTRICTION ON OWNERSHIP OF AGRICULTURAL LAND REFORM GOVERNMENT SPECIFICALLY. AND TODAY AB ONE WITNESS JOIN US REMOTELY. JOHN WEREN'T OF OWN OWNER OF WARNER FARMS. THANK THANK YOU GENERAL. PLEASE GO AHEAD SIR. SORRY THANK YOU SENATOR CONFERENCE RIGHT ME TO SPEAK TODAY COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR HEARING ME- AS I PROVIDE YOU SOME LOCAL CONTRACTOR OR PERSPECTIVE ON THIS- I PERSONALLY FEEL SEVEN ACRES IN THE LAKE COUNTY REGION OF OCALA YEAH WE WERE ALL OF. FIGS ON OUR- I'M A SMALL FARMER MIGHT FORCE MY THREE KIDS AND MY WIFE- THE WIFE IS BOSS AND ORDER TO MAKE ENDS MEET I AM ALSO- WORKED A JOB IN NUMBER. OUR LOCAL ACT MEATY- AND UNDERSTAND. THE LOCAL CONTEXT- WE HAVEN'T SEEN AN AD YOU DON'T BUY THE LAND TO FIGHT WATER. AND WHEN OWNERSHIP OF IT. PERSECUTE BE ABSOLUTELY. ESTERS INCLUDING GOV TO INVESTORS IN LAND GAME CAN AND ACCESS BUY AN ALREADY LIMITED WATER SUPPLY. UNDER THE LARGER THE AGRICULTURE. HE IS THE GREATER ADVANTAGE HAS WITH REGARDS TO IMPORT AND USE BALANCES IN OUR GROUND STATE ABILITY ACT. AS THOSE WELL FUNDED IN. CAN DEVELOP PHYSICAL REGION TO REGION FURTHERMORE THEY CAN DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECT THE WATER USED ANY SPECIFIC WHAT. BOB ARE ABLE TO. WHAT LAND WHERE MY A GAIN GREATER TO NAY WATER UNDERSTATEMENT OR RULE SMALL FARMERS SIMPLY CAN'T COMPETE WITH THE POWER FOR INVESTORS- AND FOR THAT SCARCE RESOURCE OF WATER- THIS IS A WATER OUT AND CARE. INSURANCE FOR SMALL BREWERS LIKE MYSELF ARTICLE. KING ISSUES CONTINUE TO BE A CONCERN FOR ACT PRODUCT EXPLOITATION FOREIGN OWNED AGRIBUSINESSES AND LANDOWNERS BENEFIT BY BEING ABLE TO SKIRT FOREIGN COUNTRY IMPORT RESTRICTIONS ON U. S. GOODS FOR EXAMPLE WOULD CALIFORNIA GROWERS STRUGGLES. OF THAT COUNTRY CAN MORE WE IMPORT THEIR CALIFORNIA GROWN PRODUCE INTO THEIR OWN COUNTRY BECAUSE THEY MAKE THE RULES THERE AND WHILE THIS IS A GLOBAL ISSUE AFFECT THE VIABILITY OF LOCAL FARMERS DURING. IN THE MARKET FOR. CHANGE YEARS. THIRD POINT THAT I WANT BRING UP WITH YOU TO. YEAH I HAVE TO WITH BURKE YOUR- OF VERTICAL INTEGRATION A CONCERN WITH CONTROLLED. ANY FOREIGN ENTITY. I THINK CHIC BURKE INTEGRATION CONTROL THE FOOD SUPPLY FROM THE- COULD PROCESS. IF THEY CONTROL THE PROCESSING AND FARMLAND THEY CONTROL EVERY ASPECT OF THE FOOD. FOR COMPANIES THAT EXHIBITED VERTICAL INTEGRATION. OF THE FOOD SOURCE MARKET EXAMPLES INCLUDE W. H. GROUP- WHICH DEALS WITH PORK AND GBS WHICH DEALS WITH ME TO BY THE WAY I THINK SENATOR. THE STATE IT WAS TACTIC THERE LIMITATION A LITTLE BIT TO ALLOW- WH GROUP HAD TO TAKE. OF A US TWENTY AND FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND ACRES OF THEIR FARMLAND WHICH THEN GET TO THE MONOPOLY ON THE U. S. PORK INDUSTRY. TO GIVE AN EXAM. PART OF ME STATE. APPLE OF WHAT HAVE WHEN YOU LOOSEN THE RAIN ON THIS LOSE MORE CONTROL SUPPORT COVER SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO IN SUCH A VERTICAL INTEGRATION OF GOVERNMENT. WITH ONE GRACE AND IN MIND PURCHASE FOOD MANUFACTURING FACILITY TO PROCESSING PLANT IN THE LAND USED TO PRODUCE THE RAW GOODS IT WOULD PROVIDE THEM WITH ABSOLUTE CONTROL OF FOOD PRODUCTS. GOVERNMENT BY. TO REALLY CONTROL FOOD PIPELINE OUR FUTURE THIS CALL X. LET ME THINK MISTER WARNER COULD COULD YOU PLEASE- RIGHT IT UP. YES WANTED TO SAY. THAT IT'S A MATTER OF THREE ARE YOU CONCERNED OUR WATER SCARCITY- ACCESS TO GLOBAL VERTICAL INTEGRATION CONCERN IS- ONE OF THE GREATEST CONCERNS- FROM THE FIELD OUT HERE IN. THANK YOU YOUR- I'M SINCE THAT INDIVIDUAL MR WARNER WAS YOUR ONLY A WITNESS LET'S MOVE TO WITNESSES HERE IN ROOM TWENTY TWO HUNDRED ANY INDIVIDUALS WISHING TO COMMENT SEEING NONE LET'S MOVE TO ONLINE MODERATOR- DO WE HAVE ANY VISUALS WISHING TO IN. THE SPILL AIR SO IF YOU COULD LET ME KNOW HOW MANY ARE THE QUEUE. THANK YOU IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT PLEASE PRESS ONE AND ZERO AT THIS TIME. I CURRENTLY HAVE NO COMMENT THANK YOU THANK YOU ALL RIGHT MOVING- TO THOSE THAT MIGHT BE IN OPPOSITION WE DON'T HAVE ANYONE ON FILE- THAT I KNOW OF ON. WITH OPPOSITION ANYONE. SEEING NONE OF MODERATE CAN YOU GO TO THE PHONE LINES ANY INDIVIDUALS WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO AFTER FIVE. I HAVE NO COMMENT THANK YOU ALL RIGHT THANK YOU- BRING IT BACK TO THE DAYS- I'M GONNA START OFF WITH A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS. TO THE AUTHOR- I LIKE THE IDEA GENERAL GIST OF. OF WHAT IS. BEING IT BEING ATTEMPTED HERE IN FACT MY OFFICE NINE- WE HAD- A BILL THAT WE WERE WORKING ON- THAT HAD SOME SIMILARITIES TO THIS- BUT I'M I WANTED TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT THERE WAS CLARITY ON ONE ISSUE IN PARTICULAR- BECAUSE I THINK. HE ANALYSIS AND MAYBE EVEN THE WAY IN PACKAGED- BY PRESENTATION A WAR BY OTHERS. IS THAT WERE REFERRING TO IT AS FOREIGN OWNERSHIP. NOW THE BILL INDICATES. LET'S SEE WHERE IT IS ON. THIS WOULD BE THE ONE TO THREE FOURTH PARAGRAPH THIS BILL WOULD PROHIBIT A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT. ART AND BECAUSE I THINK WHAT WE'RE WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS THAT FOREIGN GOVERNMENT IS BEING. USED IN A WAY THAT IS IDENTIFYING IT AS FOREIGN OWNERSHIP. IS THERE A DISTINCTION WITH THE AUTHOR'S INTENT ON THAT ISSUE YES THE DENTAL OF THE ILL IS GUEST ON FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS. NOW EIGHT MAKING PART OF THE REASON WHY FOREIGN OWNERSHIP IS KIND OF BEING BROUGHT UP IS THAT. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU KNOW OUR TEAM HAS ALSO BEEN WORKING ON IS A CORPORATE TRANSPARENCY ACT AT LEAST WHAT KIND OF WATCHING. WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT WAY IT'S GOING TO GO. AND PART OF IT IS THAT THERE'S NOT A WHOLE. THERE'S A LOT OF ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT ON. UNDERSTANDING WHERE A CORPORATION. LIKE WHO THEIR BENEFICIAL OWNERS ARE. AT YOU KNOW WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT- UP THE SHELL CORPORATIONS FOR EXAMPLE YOU THINK OF THEM LIKE OPENING UP AND SOME LIKE THE BAHAMAS OR SOME FOREIGN COUNTRY RIGHT BUT THE REALITY IS THAT SHELL CORPORATIONS ARE BEING FORMED RIGHT HERE IN THE U. S. AND SO. YOU VERY WELL HAVE A CORPORATION THAT IS- THE CALIFORNIA CORPORATION RIGHT AND IT COULD VERY WELL BE OWNED BY A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT- SO IT SOLD THE BILL IS FOCUSED ON FOREIGN GOT ANTS BUT I THINK THAT WITH THE CORPORATE TRANSPARENCY. ACT LEGISLATION IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF IT I THINK THAT THAT WILL KIND OF BRING TO LIGHT A LITTLE BIT MORE ASKED TO WHO IS WAS BEHIND AT THESE BUT THESE RATIONS YEAH- AND THANK YOU FOR THAT CLARIFICATION I DO WANT TO HONE IN ON THIS BECAUSE THIS IS. A MYTH ISSUE WILL MOVE TOWARD- YOU MAY WISH TO I'M NOT CERTAIN IT'S IN THE FORM OF A RESPECT TO PRESIDENT. RIGHT IT'S- IT'S IDENTIFIED AS FOREIGN END REPORT THAT IS BEING ASKED HERE- IS FOR FOREIGN GOVERNMENT IS IT YOUR INTENTION THAT IT ALSO INCLUDES. AFFILIATED STATE OWNED ENTERPRISE. SO I THE INTENTION OF THIS BILL IS FOREIGN OWNED GOVERNMENTS. OUR END SO IT'S WITH RICKY ISSUE I UNDERSTAND RIGHT SO WHAT IT HONAN IT'S A SEPARATE IT'S A SEPARATE ISSUE RIGHT THAT HAS TO DO FALL. IT'S NOT PART OF THIS BILL BUT THE CORPORATE TRANSPARENCY ACT WILL HAVE WHAT INTO. THEY'RE DOING THE WORK THAT I THINK WILL. PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO US YES MY WITHOUT A ROOKIE LIKE WERE NOT NECESSARILY REQUESTING IT IN THIS BILL FOR IT SO- THE BILL RIGHT NOW AND I DON'T KNOW IF IT NEEDS TO BE. ARE REAFFIRMED THE- PIECE THAT ARE CIRCULATING AS A- MEANS GOOD MAN. NOW THE UNITED STATES ITS STATE. OR POSSESSIONS INCLUDE STATE OWNED AND- SO I'M I'M- PERSONAL I LIKE A LOT DEAR OF THE BILL- OWNED ENTER- IS WHERE I THINK THINGS ARE GOING TO GET. VERY VERY TRICKY. I'VE HAD RECOMMENDED. FOR YOU TO CONSIDER FOLLOWING PRESIDENT BIDEN'S. BOB LEAD ON ON THIS ISSUE HIS EXECUTIVE ORDER WHICH WAS ORIENTED TOWARD CHINA AND LET'S NOT KID OURSELVES THAT'S RICH WHAT IS OF MOST INTEREST WHEN IT COMES TO FOREIGN. TWICE ALREADY THE STATE OWNED ENTERPRISES THAT WAY- THE FEW NO FOOD AG FOLKS THAT HAVE TO COMPILE YOU KNOW WATER DATA WERE AG DATA HAVE SOMETHING TO WORK FROM BECAUSE UNLESS THEY HAVE SOMETHING TO CROWD MIGHT ALLEN CHAU FOR. THE DIVISIONS OF THE STATE TO EVEN BEGIN THIS THIS PROCESS BECAUSE STATE OWNED ENTERPRISE IS A LENGTHY DATA DRIVEN INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY DRIVEN PROCESS. I JUST WANT TO THROW THAT OUT THERE THAT YOU MAY WANT. TO CONSIDER- ENDING THIS. BEFORE PROBES JUST TO FOLLOW PRESIDENT BIDEN'S- IDENTIFICATION OF THE NAMED INDIVIDUALS. COULD BE HELPFUL. THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE THAT MISTER CHAIR AND I THINK WITH- YOU KNOW THE WATER CRISIS THAT WE'RE FACING NOW AND JUST AS I WITNESSED- KIND OF TOUCHED ON LIKE WATER THAT COULD ALSO BE WATER RATES AND SO GUESS I UNDERSTAND THREE- THAT. THAT THAT EXECUTIVE ORDERS JUST FOCUSED IN ON CHINA BUT I MEAN. THAT WE GOT TO BE CAUTIOUS ABOUT IT EXACTLY- I MEAN I THINK WHEN IT COMES THROUGH OUR MOST NATURAL RESOURCE RIGHT NOW I MEAN WE'RE PEOPLE ARE FACING- WATER SHORTAGE ALL ACROSS THE STATE RIGHT- WE NEED TO WE NEED TO KNOW IT'S- SPONSOR. WILL IT HAS UP ACCESS TO THIS THIS PERSON'S NOT A RESOURCE AND ARE IT THAT'S THAT'S KIND OF HOW YOU KNOW THE WHOLE BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF JUST YOUR RAMIFICATIONS THAT COME FROM IT AND AS HER WITNESS ALSO MENTIONED- I DON'T KNOW THERE WAS A WORK FOR BUT VERTICAL. INTEGRATION INTEGRATION ADDED I DON'T KNOW THAT'S WHAT WITH WHAT WAS CALLED I JUST CALLED THE CONSOLIDATION BUT- IT WHAT YOU WERE SEEING A LOT MORE OF THAT AND YES WITH FOOD PRODUCERS AND FOOD. PRODUCERS YES IN THE VALLEY BUT YOU KNOW ACROSS THE NATION. AND SO I THINK THAT. I DEFINITELY DON'T WANT TO CREATE MORE ISSUES RIGHT- ORGANS IT CONCERNS IN TERMS OF. YOU KNOW MOVING THIS THIS BILL ALONG BUT I'LL LIKE I ALSO THINK THAT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE COULD BE A POSSIBLY DIFFERENT APPROACH TO ADDRESSING THE CONCERNS. AND I'LL CONCLUDE MY- THAT CENTER GLAZER CHURCHES WHICH IS TO COMMENT FURTHER- THIS IS A PROHIBITION. THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS STEP. THIS IS UNLIKE WHAT THE FEDERAL AUTHORITIES HAVE. FEDERAL AUTHORITIES BY AND LARGE HAVE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS WE ARE ATTEMPTING THROUGH THIS BILL OR YOU ARE RATHER. TO PRODUCE IT THE FOREIGN GOVERNMENT OWNERSHIP- DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY THROUGH STATE OWNED ENTERPRISE OF AG RELATED ASSETS IS A POSSIBILITY OF MAKING THIS BILL WORK IN THE RIGHT WAY I WOULD JUST STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT WOULD FOLLOW PRESIDENT BIDEN'S LEAD ON IDENTIFYING IF YOU DON'T WANT TO DON'T APPLY THE COUNTRY BY NAME. ONE OTHER ALTERNATIVE. TO RESOLVE TO CATEGORIZE IT IN NOT AS NON MARKET ECONOMIES. NON MARKET ECONOMIES CAN COVER SOME OF THE INDIVIDUALS OR IN THE COUNTRIES THAT ARE REALLY AT ISSUE HERE. WITHOUT IDENTIFYING ONE IN PARTICULAR. GOOD FOR THOUGHT IT'S YOUR BILL THANK THEIR GLAZER THANK YOU CHAIR AND IT'S GREAT TO HEAR YOUR YOUR- YOUR BROAD SUPPORT FOR PRESIDENT BIDEN AND HIS- POLICIES. I BIPARTISAN AND- AND THOUGHTFUL OF YOU TO SAY THAT FIRST BOB CENTER HER TADO AT THIS BILL TAKES IMPORTANT STEPS. TO ACCOUNT FOR CURRENT FOREIGN OWNERSHIP AGRICULTURAL LANDS AND IMPORT BUT OUR RECORDS A US SECURITY INTERESTS MAY BE AT RISK IN THIS BILL CREATES AN IMPORTANT PAUSE- IN FOREIGN OWNERSHIP WHILE THAT INFORMATION IS COMPILED AND WITH THAT HAPPY TO MOVE THE BILL AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME MISTER CHAIRMAN ONLY- THAT FOOTNOTE HI I'D- I WANT TO ADD IS JUST THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE IN CONTACT WITH THE TRIBES SO THAT WE CAN GET. I DON'T EXPECT YOUR CONCERT YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE TRIBE'S OWNING AGRICULTURAL LAND BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT THAT THE LANGUAGE- IS VAGUE IN REGARDS REGARD SECOND IT JUST SAYS A FOUR AND- A FOUR IN- I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY LIKE. IT SAYS IT'S A NON U. S. GOVERNMENT ENTITY THEN IT YOU KNOW IT MAY BE OVER BROAD BUT THAT'S OTHERWISE I THINK IT'S YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT- SENATOR GLAZERS I THINK THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT. BILL AND ON IT ABOUT FOOD SECURITY AND SO I SUPPORT. I WILL SUPPORT. WE HAVE A- A MOTION ON THE BILL'S MOVE BY CENTER GLAZER- SECONDED BY- PRESIDENT BIDEN- WE- ALL RIGHT- CAN WE CALL THE ROLL.
