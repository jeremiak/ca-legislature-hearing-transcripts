AND THANK THEM FOR COMING BEFORE THE SELECT COMMITTEE TO GIVE US AN INTRODUCTION TO LET THE- AND IT'S OPPORTUNITIES. IN CALIFORNIA. AS A STATE TRANSITIONS TO CLEAN ENERGY AND ITS ECONOMY THE DEMAND FOR LITHIUM IS PROJECTED TO GROW EXPONENTIALLY OVER THE NEXT DECADE AND BEYOND. HOWEVER TODAY ONLY ABOUT 1% OF LITHIUM PRODUCTION COME FROM THE UNITED STATES. MOST OF OUR SUPPLY COME FROM CHINA CHILE ARGENTINA AND AUSTRALIA. AND THIS CARRIES ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS ESPECIALLY FOR DOMESTIC BATTERY MANUFACTURING. AND THE AUTO INDUSTRY. RIGHT HERE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE THE ENORMOUS OPPORTUNITY TO BE A COMPETITIVE PLAYER IN THE WORLD LET HIM MARKET. ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION THE SALTON SEA GEOTHERMAL RESOURCE AREA. WHICH IS NOW GOING TO AS LITTLE VALLEY HAS THE POTENTIAL TO MEET 40% OF THE GLOBAL LITHIUM DEMAND. DEVELOPING LYDIA VALLEY IN WILL SUPPORT SALTON SEA CLEAN UP AND CREATE NEW BATTERY MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES THE DRIVE INVESTMENTS AND JOB GROWTH IMPERIAL COUNTY ONE OF THE MOST ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED REGIONS IN THE STATE. RECOGNIZING THIS UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY THE LEGISLATURE PASSED A. B. SIXTEEN FIFTY SEVEN LAST YEAR WHICH ESTABLISHED THE LITHIUM VALLEY COMMISSION WITHIN THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION. TO EXPLORE STRATEGIES THAT WILL DEVELOP THIS EMERGING INDUSTRY. IN CONTINUATION OF THESE EFFORTS THIS SELECT COMMITTEE WILL SERVE AS A COMPLIMENT TERRY VENUE FOR DISCUSSING A VARIETY. OF POLICY MATTERS AND RECOMMENDATIONS THAT COME FROM THE COMMISSION'S REPORT. AGAIN I CANNOT EMPHASIZE ENOUGH THE GREAT OPPORTUNITY WE HEAR IN CALIFORNIA HAVE. AN OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD SUSTAINABLE ELECTRIC VEHICLE BATTERY SUPPLY CHAIN THAT IS RADICALLY DIFFERENT THAN ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD. WITH THAT I WOULD LIKE TO OPEN IT UP FOR ANY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THAT WISH TO MAKE ANY OPENING REMARKS. IT HAS THE ONLY OTHER COMMITTEE PERSON HERE THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP IN THIS THANK YOU FOR POINTING ME TO THIS COMMITTEE. I LOOK FORWARD TO THE PRESENTATION BECAUSE LITHIUM IS GOING TO BE THE NEXT BIG BONE EXPECTING CALIFORNIA FORGET IT'S THERE. BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO SUPPLY THE LITHIUM FOR THE BATTERIES THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE COUNTRY. POSSIBLY THE WORLD SORT OF LOOK FOR THE PRESENTATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I KNOW WE WILL HAVE COLLEAGUES COMING IN AND OUT OF THE HEARING- BUT WE'RE CERTAINLY EXCITED TO HAVE. A STELLAR SAID OF PRESENTERS TODAY ADD TO OUR FIRST PANEL. THE ROLE OF LITHIUM CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY TRANSPORTATION AND ECONOMIC FUTURE. IS CONSISTENT- DAVID HOLMES WHO SHALL CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION. WHAT THE GOOSE MON COMMISSIONER PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. AND TRYING TO PUT A SENIOR ADVISER A BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. OF BUSINESS-AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT KNOWN AS KOBE SO WE'LL BEGIN. WITH OUR FIRST PRESENTER AND THAT IS THAT CHAIR HOLD SHALL- FROM THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION WELCOME. WELL GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN THANK YOU SO MUCH TO YOU AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR- DIGITAL TOGETHER WITH YOUR COLLEAGUES TO PASS THE- THIRTY DOLLAR COMMISSION. LAW THAT HAS ENABLED US TO GET UP AND RUNNING HAPPY TO SHARE WE ARE UP AND RUNNING ALL FOURTEEN MEMBERS ARE ON BOARD DID A GREAT JOB- STILL BE PONDS HAS BEEN ELECTED CHURCHES DO A TERRIFIC. BOB AND I REALLY FEEL IT OUT WITH MY TO THAT AFRICAN PROBERT PROVERB IF YOU. WANT TO GO QUICKLY GO ALONE IF YOU WANT TO GO FAR GO TOGETHER AND WE WANT TO GO FAR AND I REALLY FEEL OF THE DIVERSITY THAT WE HAVE. ON THIS COMMISSION PEOPLE REPRESENT ASSAULTS EITHER. LET HIM RECOVERY INDUSTRY ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TRIBES LEAD TO REPRESENTATION FROM TRIBAL NATIONS ARE AND OTHERS YOU KNOW THIS IS REALLY THE PROCESS- THAT WE WANT. IT'S INCLUSIVE AND YOU KNOW WE'RE VERY MINDFUL. GOING INTO THIS THAT. YEAH IT'S- INDUSTRY THAT HAVE A VERY- TEMUJIN IMPACT ON ME COMMUTERS THE WORLD WE WANT TO. A VERY THAT I THINK CAN DO IT. MUCH BETTER AND DIFFERENTLY- IN PART BECAUSE OF THE NAY OF THIS MAY- WHICH- ALLOWS FOR OF WHAT WILL BE BY FAR THE GREATEST WAY TO THE COVERED. THAT EXIST IN THE WORLD- BECAUSE OF THE NATURE RESOURCE IN THIS. SABRINA BRYAN ALLOWS IT TO BE RECOVERED. WHAT OUR VIRTUALLY ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS. WILL REALLY EXCITED THAT REASON AS YOU OUTLINED NINETY FIVE PERCENT. OF LITHIUM TODAY IS PRODUCED IN CHILE ARGENTINA AUSTRALIA AND CHINA. BUT WE HAVE THIS INCREDIBLE GEOGRAPHIC GOOD FORTUNE. TO MAKE CALIFORNIA A WORLD LEADER ON THIS AND SO WE DON'T CONTROL THE RESOURCE- THE FACT WE HAVE IT'S JUST GOOD FORTUNE BUT WE DO CONTROL WE DO ABOUT IT THAT'S WHAT THIS PROCESS IS ABOUT SO. I WANT TO JUST BEGIN BY GIVING A LITTLE BIT OF AN OVERVIEW- AND- WHERE THIS FITS IN SO YOU KNOW WE THINK ABOUT LIVING I THINK THE BEST WAY TO UNDERSTAND IT. IS TO REALLY THINK ABOUT IT AS THE OIL OF THE CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE. IT IS FUNDAMENTAL TO EVERYTHING WE'RE DOING OBVIOUSLY- ELECTRIC CARS PARKED ARE SKYROCKETING NOW IT'S NOT JUST GOOD. TESLA IS THE MOST NOTABLE CAR CAN BE THE WORLD'S OF MORE VALUABLE THE NEXT. THREE BIGGEST- IN IN THE U. S. BUT ALSO JUST IF YOU LOOK AT THE TRENDS I MEAN EVEN YESTERDAY. FORD ANNOUNCED THAT THEY'RE GOING TO INCREASE INVESTMENT. IN VEHICLE ELECTRIFICATION TWENTY TWO BILLION BY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE TO TWENTY FIVE. YEAH DOES THAT INCREASE THEIR STOCK PRICE WENT UP 8% THE MARKET IS ADVANTAGES. ELECTRIC VEHICLE INVESTMENTS BECAUSE IT SEEMS THAT IS THE FUTURE AND- THIS IS A GOOD SIGN EVERY MAJOR CAR COMPANY AROUND THE WORLD IS INVESTING ELECTRIC. IN AND DAY OUT IN CALIFORNIA TODAY WORKED EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND SOLD WE'RE ADDING SIX HUNDRED FIFTY ELECTRIC VEHICLES A DAY. AND LAST YEAR AS YOU KNOW MISTER CHAIRMAN. ELECTRIC VEHICLES BECAME THE NUMBER ONE EXPORT FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE HAVE THIRTY FOUR MANUFACTURING FACILITIES. MAKING ELECTRIC VEHICLES- INCLUDING ELECTRIC BUSES COMPANIES LIKE. PROTERRA B. Y. D. OR SELLING ELECTRIC BUSES TO FORTY STATES. AROUND THE COUNTRY MANUFACTURED HERE TO THIS IS GROWING. BEYOND OUT WE WANT THE DIVISION WE LIVED IN. VALLEY IS REALLY TO. COME PLEAD THAT COOL LITHIUM ECOSYSTEM WE WILL TO DO. HIM HERE AT. ENVIRONMENT WITH WAY HOW OF. LIKE THE VEHICLE AS WELL AS IN A STORAGE ENTITIES TO ALL IT'S KIND. AS POINT OUT. THIS YEAR IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE WHERE DO A TEN FOR INCREASE. OF ENERGY STORAGE ON THE GRID BEING PROCURED BY THE YOU TELL. AND THE HIGH THE METER GROWING AS WE HAVE THOUSAND. BEHIND THE METER ENERGY STORAGE SYSTEMS PRETTY MUCH ALL THE LITHIUM ION. AND WE'RE ADDING ABOUT FORTY NEW ONCE A DAY AT THE RATE OF INCREASE IS GROWING SO. BUT WHAT IS NOT IN PLACE SO WE GOTTA GET TO SKILLS THE LITHIUM RECOVERY. THAT SKILL ITSELF. AND THEN. THAT REMAIN. AND TOP BY THAT WE WANT TO BUILD ALL THAT. SO IT CAN BE AND TELL- IT'S I DID SPEND A LOT OF TIME. WITH BATTERY MANUFACTURERS ARE LOOKING TO OPEN A FACILITIES IN IN CALIFORNIA'S AS THOSE WHO ALREADY HAVE. JOBS LIKE YOU KNOW BATES AND QUANTUM SCAPE AND CN'S AND SPARKS AND OTHERS- AND THAT'S ALL PART OF THIS. THIS PROCESS IS LOOKING DOWN THE COMMISSION IS GOING TO BE- GETTING INTO IT WILL BE DELIVERED IN THE REPORT AS YOU KNOW- NEXT YEAR- I DID ALSO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT YOU KNOW AS WE ARE. PUSHING THE RECOVERY OF LITHIUM THIS IS ALL IN SUPPORT AS WELL OF THE GREETING ELECTRIC GRIDS ALL THESE ELECTRIC VEHICLES- THAT ARE COMING ONLINE ARE. GETTING POWERED BY THE GREED THAT IS INCREASINGLY QUICK LAST YEAR- THE 202063% OF THE ELECTRICITY ON THE GRID IN CALIFORNIA CAME FROM CARBON FREE SOURCES. WE ARE ON ROUTE 2100% THE BY DEMONSTRATION HAS MADE THAT NOW. THE NATIONAL GOAL AND I WANT TO GIVE THAT YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES FOR. THE SUPPORT OF SB ONE HUNDRED DOT TWO AND A HALF YEARS AGO THAT'S REALLY BECOME. THE TEMPLATE AND I'M HAPPY TO SAY- JUST YESTERDAY. WE COMPLETED FOUR YEARS OF WORK ON OFFSHORE WIND GETTING A DEAL. WITH DEPARTMENT INTERIOR DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE- TOWARDS THE GOVERNOR ANNOUNCED ON OFFSHORE WIND WHICH WILL. FURTHER HELP SUPPORT OUT OF THE GREEN AGREED. TOGETHER WITH ALL THESE OTHER TERRIFIC RESOURCES. LIKE- GEOTHERMAL. ONE OF THE IMPORTANT THINGS THAT WE WANT TO. IN THE LISTING ACROSS. IT IS. A GOOD. OF ENERGY SOURCE AND- GEOTHERMAL GEOTHERMAL PLAYS IN A- AND- ROLE. PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU REMEMBER THAT WE'RE GONNA BE RETIRING. DIABLO CANYON WHICH IS THE LAST REMAINING NUCLEAR PLANT IN CALIFORNIA. IN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE MINUTES TWENTY FOUR SEVEN RESOURCE. GEOTHERMAL IS ALSO WIND AND SO. ONE OF THE DYNAMICS THAT I FIND VERY COMPACT COMPELLING EXCITING ABOUT. THE RECOVERY SAID ADDED REVENUE STREAM THAT CAN HELP MAKE. OUR GEOTHERMAL POWER PLANTS- MORE COST EFFECTIVE MANNER TO HOPEFULLY SUPPORT SO MORE INVESTMENT AND GROWTH AND EXPANSION IN THAT SECTOR WHICH IS GOOD FOR AGREED. AS WELL SO. WE'RE REALLY LOOKING AT IN THIS HOLISTIC. ON AND INCLUSIVELY YEAH THIS IS A HELLO JOURNEY I WANT TO JUST. GET MY THINKS WELL. WHAT'S THAT HE'S BEEN TERRIFIC ADDITION TO THE LOOK DOG IT'S VERY COMMON. AS WELL TO LIFT UP THIS COMMUNITY THE SALTON SEA VALLEY AS WE MOVE- YEAH THERE SOME EXCITED DISCUSSION HAPPENING THAT'S WHY ABOUT. SOME OF FUNDING THE BE ATTACK- YOU KNOW HE'S WERE RELUCTANT COVER THEIR GO TO. THE RESTAURANT SOLVE AND COMPETITIVE THE COMMUNITY- LET ME LET ME JUST WRAP UP WITH TWO. REQUESTS FOR CONSIDERING. FROM THE LEGISLATURE THE FIRST IS YOU KNOW WE HAVE THIS PROGRAM WHICH WE'VE HAD FOR ALMOST FORTY YEARS CALLED. GREATER. WHICH IS THE GEOTHERMAL. RESEARCH DEVELOPMENT WHICH GET PER. OF THE- FROM LEASES ON FOR LANDS THAT ARE THESE TWO GEOTHERMAL SO THERE'S ABOUT A DOZEN. GENERAL POWER PLANTS IN THE SALTY PRINCIPLE. WE TAKE THAT MONEY WHICH IS NOT MUCH IT'S MAYBE A MILLION OR TWO A YEAR IT COMES IN BUT WE REPURPOSE IT OUT IN GRANTS TO. SUPPORT GENERALLY- GEOTHERMAL AND BUT THE RELATED TO GEOTHERMAL ACTIVITIES. THERE IS A CONSTRAINT ON THE FACT THAT WE LIKE TO SEE LIFTED- AND WE HAVE A PROPOSAL INTO THE LEGISLATURE ON THAT AND I WOULD JUST ALLOWS GREATER FLEXIBILITY I'M VERY INTERESTED TO. FOCUS RECUERDA FUNDS THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE- TO BETTER SUPPORT A LISTING OF DEPARTMENTS SO THAT PROPOSALS FOR YOU- AND I THINK ALL TOGETHER NOW OKAY ENERGY COMMISSION WE CLING TO THE NEXT SIXTEEN MILLION. FOR LITHIUM ARE DEVELOPED SOMETHING THAT CAN BRING SOME OF THAT FROM. TECH BUT THAT'S ONE THING SO MANY OTHERS JUST BIG PICTURE AROUND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET- I CAN REALLY ONLY SPEAK TO THE TWO POINT ONE BILLION. IN THE MANDATE REGARDLESS- FOR THE ENERGY COMMISSION BUT WE'RE NOT SPENT ABOUT HALF OF THAT MONEY. ON IN- TRANSPORTATION LECTER KITCHEN WHICH IS GOING TO HUGELY INCREASE THE DEMAND FOR LITHIUM LITHIUM ION BATTERIES SO. THAT INCLUDES BUILDING OUT CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE ACROSS THE STATE WE'RE DOING ABOUT HALF OF OUR CHARGING INVESTMENTS. IN LOW INCOME AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND WILL ALSO BE SUPPORTING- THERE'S A TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION TO SUPPORT- DURING EUROVISION VEHICLES MANUFACTURED ARE WHICH I THINK ALSO FITS VERY WELL. WITH THE RHODESIAN BEHIND WITH THE VALLEY SO ARE ASK YOUR SUPPORT. AS YOU CONSIDER THOSE ITEMS THIS WILL. NOT STOP THERE. AT TO TAKE A QUESTION THANK YOU THANK THANK YOU CHAIR WILL GO HEAD AND- HOLD OFF QUESTIONS TO LAUGHTER THE LAST. AND SOUL. HANG TIGHT THERE WILL GET BACK TO DE HAS. QUESTIONS THAT MAKE UP FOR YOU TO. OUR NEXT- ANALYSTS. AND SPEAKER BE MARTHA GOES COMMISSIONER OF THE PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSION. WELCOME THANK YOU TO GARCIA THAT COULD HAVE MA'AM I AM WANT TO THANK YOU INVITING ME TO I REALLY WAS SO I MOST JUST CAN TIE A LITTLE ABOUT THAT MAY ROLE AT THE PEACE PLAY ON THAT. ANOTHER THING THAT WE CAN WHICH IS ON AT THE PROCUREMENT AND IN THE CRITICAL ROLE THAT THERMAL PRODUCTION PLAYS RIGHT TO ACTUALLY HEAL THE LITHIUM OF FOR THIS EFFORT YEAH NEXT YEAR HOPE SHE'LL MENTIONED- WE ACTED VAULT FOR MANY YEARS WITH TRYING TO ADDRESS THE ENERGY NEEDS IN PARTICULAR RELATED TO DIABLO BUT OTHER RELIABILITY NEEDS THAT HAVE ARISEN AS WE USED TO HAVE ALL SINCE THAT TIME. AND JUST THIS FRIDAY. UGH EGGMAN OFTEN A DECISION THERE'S ACTUALLY ALSO. AN ALTERNATE HE ISSUE. BUT OVERALL THE PROPOSED DECISION IS RECOMMENDING THAT THERE IS A NEED FOR ALL THE% HELLO SERVING ENTITIES TO PROCURE ELEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED ADDITIONAL MEGAWATTS THAT'S A VERY LARGE NUMBER. ELEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED THE NEW ELECTRICITE RESOURCES TO COME ONLINE BETWEEN THE YEARS TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND TWENTY TWENTY SIX. THIS IS WHAT WE CONSIDER A MID TERM PROCUREMENT. AND AS WAS MENTIONED RIGHT YOU'RE HOPE SHIELDING YOURSELF- JERRY GARCIA WE NEED TO GET TO A HUNDRED BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE SO THE NEEDS OF THESE TYPES OF RESOURCES WHICH I'LL GET INTO A LITTLE BIT. ARE REALLY CRITICAL LOWS FOR THE MID TERM PROCUREMENT AS WELL AS OUR LONG TERM GOALS IT IT PASSED SINCE IT IS INEVITABLE THAT WE WILL DEPEND ON GEOTHERMAL TO GET REALLY THE QUESTION IS THE TIMELINE. AND THE MIXTURE OF THE PORTFOLIO. THIS IS A- THERE'S A COUPLE GOALS JOB CANYON PLACEMENT WAS ONE IN OF-COURSE GETTING TO ON TRACK AND MAINTAINING ON TRACK 2100% BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE. THE BIG COMPONENT OF THESE ELEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED- MAKE LOTS IS THAT TWO THOUSAND OF THOSE. MEGAWATTS NEED TO BE A LONG COULD WE CONSIDER THEM TO HAVE A LONG LEAD TIME RESOURCE TO BE IN LINE AT THE LATER TIME OF THAT MITCHELL PROCUREMENT WHICH IS TWENTY TWENTY SIX- IN THOSE TYPES OF OUR RESOURCES OUR- RESOURCES LIKE GEOTHERMAL BUT ALSO. LONG DURATION STORAGE IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE. HOW FOR THE TWO THOUSAND SO ONE THOUSAND. MIDDLE WATCHED MUST COMFORT ENERGY RESOURCE MATCH REALLY THE ATTRIBUTES OF GEO THERMAL. AND THIS IS THAT THINGS LIKE THAT THE RESOURCE MUST BE DISPATCHABLE THAT MUST BE FIRM AND IT MUST HAVE THE MINIMUS EMISSIONS ALL OF THESE ARE THE ATTRIBUTES THE GEOTHERMAL HAS AND CAN OFFER NOT TO MEET THIS ONE THOUSAND MEGAWATT REQUIREMENTS- LET'S SEE HERE. I WAS ALSO GONNA- NOTE THAT EVEN OF COURSE TODAY THE LOAD SERVING ENTITIES COULDN'T SEEK THESE CONTRACTS WITH GEOTHERMAL PROJECTS AND I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT- THE CCA'S COMMITTEE CHOICE AGGREGATORS A LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE ACTUALLY SOME OF THE LEADING- ALEX IS THAT ARE ENGAGING IN CONTRACTS WITH GEOTHERMAL AND JUST LAST NOVEMBER- WE SAW THAT HAVE NOT RESIGNED HIS NUMBER BUT CCA'S ARE EXPECTED TO BRING ONLINE FOURTEEN MEGAWATTS. OF GEOTHERMAL BY TWENTY TWENTY TO. S. IT'S A SMALLER STAFF OF COURSE THERE IS COURAGE UNDER CONTRACT ADDITION BEEN TERMS OF THE NEW CONTRACTS THAT'S ONE A GOOD SIGN- AND IN ADDITION JUST AS WE AS I MENTIONED THIS IS A PROPOSED DECISION IT IS OUT FOR COMMENT AND SO WOULD WELCOME. OF COURSE ALL OF THE MEMBERS THAT THE PUBLIC AS WELL TO REALLY ENGAGE AS WE DELIBERATE ON THE FINAL PIECE OF THIS PROPOSED DECISION OR ANY REFINEMENTS ARE JUST MONTHS. AND WE ALSO WILL BE HOLDING WHAT WE CALL AN ALL PARTY WHERE ALL OF THE PARTIES INVOLVED WILL HAVE THEIR OPPORTUNITY TO PUBLICLY PUSH FOR ANY AMENDMENTS TO THE PROPOSED DECISION- AND THEN FINALLY I JUST WANTED TO KNOW AS SUCH- HOPE SHE'LL MENTION THAT IT'S REALLY BEEN. AND I WOULD ENJOYABLE TO BE A PART OF THE LITHIUM VALLEY COMMISSION. AND PARTICULARLY TO SEE THE LOCAL SHOULD REALLY FOCUS ON AS WE DEAL WITH ALL OF THESE ESTIMATES AND NUMBERS AND PRODUCTION GOALS AN- EXCEPTION THAT WE DON'T. THAT WE DO SO WITH A COMMUNITY MEETING FIRST AND JUST WANTED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOUR BOSS'S BEEN EXCELLENT IN OUR FRAMING OF THOSE DISCUSSIONS AND- I REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING AND TO SEE WHAT PART THE COMMISSION S. C. C. P. C. AT THE COMMISSION COULD CONTRIBUTE. TO THE LITHIUM BALLON COMMISSION GOALS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH COMMISSIONER. WILL UP AGAIN HOLD OFF ON ANY QUESTIONS UNTIL AFTER LAST PRESENTER- BUT I'M SURE THERE WILL BE SOME QUESTIONS- WILL GO ON TO OUR NEXT UP SPEAKER AND THAT IS KIND OF PALLADA TO YOUR VISOR OF THE- BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT- AND GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT- PLEASE. I BEGAN. THIS A GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND TO THE NUMBER OF SILICON VALLEY THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK- MY NAME IS KIND OF PRAYER AND I'M THE SENIOR ADVISER OF BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT AT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. CORDOBA'S AS YOU MENTIONED. AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY IN THE INVITE TO IMPROVE TO PROVIDE INPUT INTO THIS DISCUSSION AND TO SHARE OUR PERSPECTIVE ON THE IMPORTANCE OF BUILDING. A DOMESTIC LITHIUM SUPPLY CHAIN AND HOW THE STATE CAN LAY THAT FOUNDATION. THAT TO PROMOTE FUTURE INVESTMENTS. IN OUR AREA. BUILDING LOOK IN SUPPLY CHAIN PRESENTS. AN IMPERATIVE AN OPPORTUNITY. IT IS IMPERATIVE BECAUSE WE HAVE MADE SUCH A PROFOUND AND GLOBALLY RELEVANT COMMITMENT TO BOTH STAFF. AND TO A RESILIENT DECARBONISE GREAT. BOTH OF WHICH WILL RELY TO EVEN MORE SIGNIFICANT EXTENT. ON THE PRODUCTION OF LITHIUM AND MORE PARTICULARLY LITHIUM BATTERY PRODUCTION WELL IN EXCESS OF TODAY'S GLOBAL OUT. THERE ARE OTHER MERGING BATTERY CHEMISTRIES THAT ARE INTERESTING AND RELEVANT NO WE NEED SCALABILITY IN THE NEAR TERM ESPECIALLY AND IN REFERENCE TO OUR ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES AND IT MUST BE AFFORDABLE WHICH MEANS WE MUST EXTRUDING EXTRACTED. A LOT OF LIBYA. THERE IS CURRENTLY A GLOBAL CONTEST AS WAS MENTIONED BY THE CHAIR ON THIS EMERGING RESOURCE AND OTHER COUNTRIES ESPECIALLY- SOME WHICH ARE NOT NECESSARILY CONDUCIVE TO UNITED STATES MENTALITY AT TODAY'S LITHIUM RESOURCES ARE EITHER HIGHLY CONCENTRATED. OR PRODUCED IN ENVIRONMENTALLY DAMAGING WAYS AS CHAIR HOPE SHE'LL MUCH. FROM AN ACCOUNTING PERSPECTIVE. IT PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO SOURCES DIRECTLY IN A MORE CONDUCIVE MANNER- LIMITING SOME OF THE TRANSPORTATION CONSTRUCTION STRENGTH. AND ALSO IMPROVING- BOTH SOURCING AND MANUFACTURING CLOSE TO HOME WHICH GUARANTEES NO SUPPLY FOR OUR MANUFACTURERS. AND ALSO REDUCING WITHIN PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT. THAT BEING SAID THIS ALSO CREATES A TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY. IS AN OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE CALIFORNIA CAN DELIVER ON THE INTEGRATED BENEFITS FOR BOTH LOCAL COMMUNITY OF THE STATE AND FOR THE GLOBAL MARKET PLACE AS WAS MENTIONED BY THE PREVIOUS TWO SPEAKERS. YEAH I'M JUST A SECURE SUPPLY OF THESE RAW NATURAL RESOURCES WHICH IS ENTIRELY VALUABLE IN AND OF THEMSELVES. CALIFORNIA CAN NURTURE THE FULL VALUE ADDED INDUSTRY OF BATTERY PRODUCTION AND THOSE RELATED TECHNOLOGIES. AND THIS IS A POTENTIAL SOURCE FOR HIGH WAGE JOBS IN THE FUTURE. BY WORKING WITH GLOBAL FIRMS WERE PURSUING THE LICKING VALLEY RESOURCE AND THE EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS IN THE REGION CALIFORNIA CAN PARTNER TO DEVELOP CURRICULA AND JOB PLACEMENT STRATEGIES THAT CREATE LOCAL PATHWAYS. TO THESE HIGH ROAD JOBS. A CLOSE LOOP LITHIUM EXTRACTION PROCESS INDUSTRY IS PROMISING AND CAN BECOME A MODEL FOR THE WORLD. IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN AND DEVELOP A CIRCULAR ECONOMY AS IT RELATES TO LITHIUM PRODUCTION AND BATTERY PRODUCTION AS WELL AS OUR MISSION VEHICLES THIS IS DEFINITELY NEEDED AND NEEDED TO BE IN CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA CAN REQUIRE ENCOURAGE COMPANIES TO PAY INTO AN ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION PLAN THAT WILL ALSO BENEFIT THE SOLVENCY AS CHURCHILL PENSION FOR. ANY STRUCTURED PROPERLY THE STATE'S ELECTRIC LOAD SERVING ENTITIES TEMPERATURE COST EFFECTIVE YOU THERMAL POWER FROM THE SAME BRIAN THAT PRODUCES LITHIUM THEREBY REDUCING OVERALL COSTS FOR BOTH PRODUCTION OF POWER AND THE EXTRUSION UP WITH. ADDING A CRITICAL TWENTY FOUR SEVEN RESOURCE. AGAIN AS GERMAN HOPE SHE'LL MENTION SINCE WE'RE LOSING GALA CANYON IN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE- NEXT I'LL GO INTO SOME OF THE OPPORTUNITY HOW THESE OPPORTUNITIES ARE GOING TO DELIVER BY GOBIZ AND THROUGH SUPPORT OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS LOCAL AGENCIES COMMUNITY GROUPS FEDERAL- WE RECOGNIZE THAT. TO BE ABLE TO HANDLE ANYTHING OF THIS MAGNITUDE REQUIRES A LOT OF LOCAL SUPPORT BOTH FROM SALT AREA COMMUNITY GROUPS LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN ORDER TO ACCELERATE PROJECT DEVELOPMENT WHEREVER POSSIBLE. AND AS SUCH OUR GOAL THIS TEAM AND AS PART OF OUR EXPANSION THROUGH THE REGION PRICE TOGETHER INITIATIVE HAS IMPLEMENTED SOME LOCAL SUPPORT MEASURES. INCLUDING MONTHLY MEETINGS WITH THE S. AND KERIO VALLEY ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION SCHERING INCENTIVE PROGRAMS AND SUPPORT FROM WITHIN VALLEY ASSOCIATED COMPANIES MANY OF WHICH WERE MENTIONED EARLIER PATCHWORK OF SHIELD AND WE ARE WORKING WITH THOSE COMPANIES DIRECTLY. TO BOTH ON CHAIN CONTRACTS AND OPPORTUNITIES. WITHIN OUR SENSE OF PROGRAMS. ADDITIONALLY WORSE COUNTY NAVIGATE UTILITY OF THE CAPITAL INVESTMENT IN INCENTIVE PROGRAM FOR STUPID REASONS. WITH THE IMPERIAL IRRIGATION DISTRICT ON A TAX RATE WILL PARCELS MATCH- GEOTHERMAL WEARABLES CAN SET. ADDITIONALLY WERE WORKING WITH THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF GOVERNMENTS IBTC KAZAKH COMPANIES AND IMPERIAL COUNTY ON THE EXECUTION OF THAT ENHANCED INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING DISTRICT OF THE SOUTHERN END OF POLICY TO SUPPORT THE PROJECTOR PROJECTS AND TO PROVIDE SOME MUCH NEEDED INCENTIVES. FOR THESE MASSIVE BUILD OUT. I TO FORTY COUNTY IN CONNECTING WITH I THANK YOU ALIVE I SURF PEROT BUILDING WANTS YOU TO R. COMPLETED THE CONSTRUCTION OF THEIR WHILE. ADDITIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS THAT WILL ENABLE PRIVATE INVESTMENT WILL BE NECESSARY IN SOME OF THESE AREAS AND AS SUCH GOVERNMENT INFRASTRUCTURE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT SUPPORT. HAS BEEN PROVIDED THROUGH- OUR CONNECTIONS WITH OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS. EVERY TWO WEEKS WE CAN BE IN STATE AND FEDERAL PARTNERS IN ORDER TO SHARE UPDATES ON NOT JUST BOTH THE A VALLEY A SEARCH BUT ALSO BROADBAND EMISSIONS AND ANYTHING WHICH COULD HAVE SEVERAL GRANT OPPORTUNITIES HI THE- AS SUCH. ALL PROVIDED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO A BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION- MORE SPECIFICALLY ABOUT HOW TO OVERLAY TAX INCENTIVES AND OTHER PROGRAMMATIC INCENTIVES FOR THE PRODUCTION OF LITHIUM AND A FOR THE PRODUCTION OF BATTERIES- USING THE STATE'S TOOLS AND GRANT MAKING TAX CREDITS AND PUBLIC FINANCE. INTEGRATION SESSION TO PROMOTE THE STATE'S PRIORITIES FOR THE REGION AND TO MOTIVATE PRIVATE CAPITAL THAT IS ALIGNED WITH OUR VALUES. AND ASSISTING COMPANIES MOVING THROUGH SPECIFIC INCENTIVE PROGRAMS SUCH AS THOSE MENTIONED BEFORE AN INCLUSIVE OF KALKAJI THE EMPLOYMENT TRAINING PANEL CAPER AND OTHERS- WILL SERVE AS A MECHANISM FOR CITING LARGE ON THE DELIVERY COMPANIES WANT TO CO LOCATE NEAR THE RESOURCE SUCH AS THE MANUFACTURING. OF BATTERIES FOR A ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES WE FEEL THAT THESE ARE GOOD OPPORTUNITIES TO CREATE. LARGE SCALE INVESTMENTS WHICH AND LEAD. TO A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF JOB GROWTH OPPORTUNITY.THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU ARE YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AND I'M GONNA ASK YOU FOR ANY OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OF. ANY OF THE PRESENTERS OF SPOKEN. PLEASE GO NOW WITH THE WATER THAT IT USES TO EXTRACT THE LITHIUM WHERE'S THE WATER GOING TO COME FROM AN- OF. THE AREA THAT IT'S COMING FROM. DOWN SOUTH. MANY WATERS A BIG. WELL SHORT SUPPLY CALIFORNIA READY. TO SEE A FIVE. CAN SPEAK TO THAT I THINK I THINK SOME OF THE- DEVELOPERS WILL BE ABLE TO ANSWER THE NEXT PANEL BUT- WHAT HAPPENS IN GEOTHERMAL POWER PLANTS AS YOU CYCLE. THE SUPERHEATED GEOTHERMAL BRINE WHICH IS A YOU KNOW HALF A MILE BELOW THE SURFACE AND JUST RUNS ON A LOOP BASICALLY AND SO THIS PROCESS DOESN'T REQUIRE ADDITIONAL WATER YOU'RE JUST. TAKING DIFFERENT MOST YOU'RE YOU'RE BASICALLY JUST CIRCLING THE SAME PRODUCTS SUPERHEATED BRIAN THAT. RUNS THE DIFFICULT PART THERE'S A PROCESS TO WITHDRAW THAT- THERE MAY BE SOME I MEAN I THINK THERE'S MORE DETAIL THAT OF THE DEVELOP GETS TO- WHAT ARE INTERNATIONAL YOUR USING THEIR- PRIVATE. IN SERVICE OF THE CHILDREN OF OUR PLANTS. THANK YOU. NO QUESTIONS. TWO BUT MR BRAY YOU- DESIST ABOUT THE COME MARKET GLOBAL LITHIUM MARKET AS A STATE HOW DO WE ENCOURAGE COMPANIES OR INVESTORS TO PICK UP CALIFORNIA'S OPPORTUNITIES- VERSUS WHAT SEEMS TO BE. A COMPETITOR AT TIMES IS NEVADA WHO HAS MIGHT HAVE A SMALL. FRACTURED OF THE LITHIUM OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE HAVE HERE IN CALIFORNIA CAN YOU SPEAK TO THAT. YES THANK YOU MISTER SO VERY GOOD QUESTION AND SOMETHING THAT WE DEAL WITH ON A DAILY BASIS ONE WHEN WE'RE DEALING WITH COMPANIES ARE LOOKING AT THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE PRESENTED TO THEM THEY'RE THEY'RE DOING WHAT IS ESSENTIALLY A VERY DIFFICULT CALCULUS. A LOT OF IT DEALS WITH BOTH THE LOGISTICS THAT THEY HAVE TO DEAL WITH AND MOVING THE GOOD THAT THEY NEED TO PRODUCE THEIR- AND PRODUCTS BUT ALSO THE ENDING WAS JUST AS TO HOW THEY ACTUALLY SHIP THIS MARKET STUFF. THEY'RE LOOKING AT A NUMBER OF CENTERS WITH MAYBE COST CENTERS AND IN THE CASE OF CALIFORNIA PERSONS ABOUT A ONE OF THE- MORE TREMENDOUS DIFFERENCES IS IN OUR ENERGY RATES. AND AS SUCH IF WE ARE ABLE TO EXPAND GEOTHERMAL REDUCED RATES AND ALSO INCREASE PRODUCTION THAT WOULD BE. SOMETHING THAT THEY WOULD DEFINITELY FIND TO BE MORE VALUABLE- THAT WOULD BE CLOSER THE RESOURCE THEREBY ELIMINATING SOME OF THE LOGISTICS COST AND ALSO POTENTIALLY REDUCING SOME OF THE BURDEN OF THE PRODUCTION- OF OURS OUR ENERGY- WE ALSO EXPECTS THAT COLOCATION CREATES AN OPPORTUNITY WHERE SOME OF THE BATTERIES MANUFACTURERS NAGLE HQ REMANUFACTURING OR EXCLUSION OF THE- OF THE PIECES TO BE ABLE TO RECYCLE THOSE GOODS AND SO WE DEPLOYED. MARKET AND SOME CONCENTRATION AND GOOD AND COLOCATION IS GOING TO BE VITAL TO BOTH OF THOSE AREAS ESPECIALLY AS YOU TRY AND DRIVE COSTS DOWN IN WHAT IS GOING TO BE AN EVEN MORE COMPETITIVE. ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES FACE. THANK YOU THAT'S HOW MAY. IT CHAIR HOPE CHILD MAYBE. WE AND THIS- BASED ON KIND OF YOUR HANDS. THE REALLY. TO THE LEDGE. I OF RIGHT- LOCATION OKAY LOCATION RIGHT. AS WITH THE LOGISTICS OF IT- THAT CHAIR HOPE CHILD IN HIS PRESENTATION TALKED ABOUT- DE MULTE MULTIPLE- CONNECTIONS TO STATE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES. AND THE ISSUE OF. POWER GENERATION NEEDED FOR THE LARGE INVESTMENTS GOING INTO. ELECTRIFICATION INFRASTRUCTURE. MAYBE HE COULDN'T ELABORATE A BATES AND CONNECTING THOSE DOTS- BUILDING OFF OF YOUR RESPONSE BECAUSE- I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING. TO BE SAID ABOUT. THE LOCATION THE MULTIPLE COAL BENEFITS. OF LOOKING VALLEYS OPPORTUNITIES- THAT IT'S PRESENTED SO MISTER CHAIRED WOULD YOU LIKE O. PASS ALONG. TO TWO CASES WE CAN MAKE FOR THESE COMPANIES AS TO WHERE THEY LOOK AT ONE IS. OUR PROXIMITY TO MARKETS- IF YOU TALK TO. THE COMPANIES THAT ARE MANUFACTURING LIKE TO BE ABLE TO CALIFORNIA AND I FOUND. THAT GREAT LENGTH. THAT'S ONE OF THEIR MAJOR. THANK YOU FOR THE LARGEST MARKET FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES IN THE UNITED STATES BY FAR ABOUT HALF THE- US SELECTIVE VEHICLE MARKET THE SAME IS TRUE FOR ENERGY STORAGE. AND SO BEING CLOSE THOSE MARKETS TO CLOSE THOSE CUSTOMERS TO REDUCE SHIPPING COSTS. IS A BIG ADVANTAGE IN THAT SECONDLY IS THE HUMAN RESOURCES YOU KNOW IN A CREDIBLE- TALENT POOL HERE IN CALIFORNIA- IN THE REGION. THAT THEY CAN DROP ARM. ONE IN ADDITION I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT ONE OF THE PROGRAMS THAT HI THIS. IS TAMMY DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO SUPPORT. OTHER THING VALLEY WITH WHICH IS- THE KEY TO A BOARD. OF WHICH THE TERRIBLE ACADEMICALLY CAN NOW WE CAN SEE EXAMPLES OF. YOUR BILL- BUT IT BASICALLY IS. THE TRANSPLANT G. YOU KNOW FINANCING. AUTHORITIES WE DON'T MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR THE TAX WORD ENERGY OF ALL SORTS INCLUDING YOU'RE JUST SOME- BETTER MANUFACTURING COULD ANOTHER OF THE STATE ARE WE ANNOUNCED UP TO TELL DOING OUR BATTERIES WE WANT TO MAKE THAT WOULD ON FOCUS STARTED WAYS I KNOW THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED DOUBLING THE BUDGET MODERNIZE TWO HUNDRED THIS YEAR. WELL I CERTAINLY SUPPORT THE I THINK A GREAT AND THAT REDUCES THE LIMITS OF THE SALES TAX ONE HUNDRED THAT'S IN AND- OUR MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT INTO THE MOTHER OF COSTA OLD START OF THESE ARE INDFUL OF. THANK YOU FOR I DO HAVE A QUESTION. FOR CHAIRS YOU HAVE A QUESTION FOR GO MON- AND THERE TO QUESTIONS OF ONE REVIEWED TO THE- DIRECTION OF LOS SERVING AS- ON CHURCH. TO PROCURE NEW. TO MEET MADE FROM A LONG TERM RELIABLE- PROCESSES USUALLY TO NOT CAN THIS- THE NONSENSE YOU'VE BEEN I REFER TO HIM AS A THE CALL- THAT WE I CAN SEE. FROM THESE AFTER. ONE CAN WE DO AS A- BODY IS THE COULD. TO ENSURE THAT THOSE COPE ARE BEING BECAUSE- IN THE PER. OF PROCURING- THAT'S THE FIRST THE SECOND AS A OF. LET THE ABOUT COMMISSION- PERHAPS YOU CAN ELABORATE ON SOME OF THE CONVERSATIONS HAPPENING AND I KNOW THAT THESE ARE QUESTIONS THAT THAT. COME UP RIGHT RELATED TO THE WATER QUESTIONS- BUT TO THE ENVIRONMENT AND WHAT WHAT TYPE OF DISCUSSIONS IS THE LET THE ABOUT THE COMMISSION HAVING. AS IT RELATES TO. THE ENVIRONMENTAL. IMPACTS THAT- PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED WITH WHEN THEY THINK OF PM EXTRACTION IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD VERSUS WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE MAYBE YOU CAN. SHED SOME LIGHT HERE I KNOW THAT IT'LL BE A QUESTIONS THAT. COMES UP THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE. SO HEARING TODAY WITH OTHER PANELISTS AS WELL. YES I THINK YOU'RE A GERMAN GARCIA I'LL TAKE A HOUSING BILLS QUESTIONS BACKWARDS AND- MOSTLY BECAUSE I WILL DIFFER LARGELY TO VOTE. ARLINGTON VALUE COMMISSION CHAIR CHAIRWOMAN CLASS AND SHOULD BE HAVE TAKEN LEADERSHIP OF FORMING A COMMITTEES SO THAT WE CAN DISCUSS THESE TOPICS AND- AND THAT'S ALREADY BEEN A PRIORITY FROM WHAT WE'VE HEARD FROM ALL THE COMMISSIONERS THERE. OF MAKING WITH THAT YOU KNOW THIS TYPE OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IS ACTUALLY A BETTER THING FOR THE COMMUNITY BOTH ECONOMICALLY BUT ALSO MENTALLY AND OF COURSE HAVING- JUST SOME BACKGROUND ON IT WE KNOW THAT HAVING A FOOTPRINT ON THE SOUTHERN END OF THE TWO KILLER. OF THE C. IT'S GONNA BE A BENEFITS TO POTENTIALLY FOR AIR QUALITY IF WE DO ALL THIS CORRECTLY. ONLY THE ACTOR WOMAN PASSED TO REALLY EXPAND ON HOW WE CAN WORK WITH COMMUNITIES AND THAT TO REALLY ENSURE THAT ALL OF THOSE CONCERNS. ARE BEING ADDRESSED AT THE FRONT END. I THE ISSUE PROCURE AT IT'S A VERY. AS I MAY. I THINK WE NEED TO HEAR NOW ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF THE PERSPECTIVE OF FOLKS WHO ARE- PROPONENTS OF GEO THERMAL IN PARTICULAR I THINK WE HAVE ACTUALLY KNOWLEDGE IN THE PROPOSED DECISION THESE OTHER BENEFITS AS YOU MENTIONED AND THE TREMENDOUS- IN A FIT OF HAVING THAT TAXIS AS EXAMPLE. SERPENTOR THERE IS OPPORTUNITY THERE AND WE HOPE TO HEAR FROM ANY FURTHER REFINEMENTS AND SO WE WELCOME THAT. TIME THESE COMMENTS I'VE NOW AND I'D BE HAPPY TO- MY SOON AS ARE ALL PARTY IS SCHEDULED ALSO BE HAPPY TO SHARE THOSE DATES AND TIMES ADAM YOUR OFFICE. THANK YOU THANK YOU I DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS WE'VE GOT A COUPLE MEMBERS THIS YEAR WHEN ASKED TO SEE IF- THEY HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OF. ANY OF THESE PRESENTERS. REMEMBER CREATES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WANNA FOLLOW UP ON YOUR QUESTION REGARDING THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT SO A LOT CAN BE SAID ABOUT WHAT THE FUTURE LOOKS LIKE WHY WHY WE NEED TO LOOKING AT. THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT EXIST HERE IN CALIFORNIA THIS IS HEADED AS MASSIVE. AS SOME OF THE STEM OPPORTUNITIES ACROSS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. BUT AT THE SAME TIME. IF THE IF YOU CAN ELABORATE JUST A LITTLE IN TERMS OF- SOME OF THE CONVERSATIONS WITH ENVIRONMENTALIST- ENVIRONMENTAL RIGHTS GROUPS. IN TERMS OF THE PROS AND CONS OR HOW WE GET TO A- A GOOD PLACE WITH REGARDS TO EXTRACTION DEVELOPMENT. AND REALLY CALIFORNIA PLANA A ROLE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY THAT AS WE HAVE. A CERTAIN GOALS THAT WE NEED TO ACHIEVE 1100% RENEWABLE BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE THAT WE ARE ALSO. THINKING ABOUT WAYS IN WHICH WE ARE PROACTIVELY. ALSO PROTECTING OUR ENVIRONMENT AT THE SAME TIME AND CURIOUS IF YOU CAN ELABORATE ON THAT JUST A BIT AND I AND I UNDERSTAND MISTER TURNER WILL ALSO. BE HAVE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ASK SIMILAR QUESTIONS TO ADDITIONAL PANELISTS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER CARILLO APPRECIATE THE QUESTION- YEAH I JUST WOULD I GUESS BEGIN BY TWENTY I THINK FOSSIL FUEL EXTRACTION HAS BEEN. ONE OF THE MOST HARMFUL THINGS TO COMMUNITIES AROUND THE WORLD AND PERSONALLY EVERYWHERE ONLINE AFRICA OUT OF THIS IS THAT JUST THE LOCAL POLLUTION AND EMISSIONS- AND- DOES INDUSTRIES OFTEN HAVE- FULLER JOBS THAT THE ARE ALSO LEARNING PRACTICAL HEALTH AND I THINK. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT SIX ABOUT THIS RESOURCE IS THAT IT IS BY FAR THE GREENEST AND MOST SUSTAINABLE WAY TO RECOVER LITHIUM. ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD SO IN ARGENTINA AND CHILE THE WAY THEY GET A LOOK HERE MISS THESE MASSIVE EVAPORATION PONDS- WERE THERE TO TAKE A QUITE A BIG FOOTPRINT TO DO THAT IN PLACES LIKE CHINA AND AUSTRALIA GOOD MORNING WILL ROCK. UP IN A DUSTING IT UP BUT IT'S- IT HAS A BIGGER FOOTPRINT THIS IS BASICALLY TAKING THE SUPERHEATED GROWING THAT'S ALREADY BELOW THE GROUND IS ALREADY BEING CYCLE DIGITAL POWER PLANTS. YEAH THERE'S A PROCESS TO WITHDRAW THE LITHIUM- THERE'S MULTIPLE TECHNOLOGIES TO DO THIS ONE OF THEM IS THEY JUST HAVE THIS ALSO BASICALLY TRACTABILITY OF THE TECHNOLOGY WHICH WOULD THINK ABOUT THIRTY MINUTES COUPLE DIFFERENT BILL OF THAT BUT IT'S A VERY VERY LIGHT. FOOTPRINT CLOSED LOOP ZERO WASTE PROCESS- AND I THINK IT'S REALLY ONE OF THE EXCITING THINGS THAT WE CAN PRODUCES AT SCALE BUT HOW ABOUT- REALLY REALLY MINIMAL IMPACT AND I THINK THAT'S- GOOD FOR THE COMMUNITY AND. AND GOOD FOR LARGER GOALS AS WELL. THANK I THINK THERE'S FOLLOW UP. THING YOU MISTER- CHAIR CHILD AYE AYE HAVE I HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN TO THE LITHIUM. MINES AND SHE AND TOTAL AND HAVE C. FIRST HAND. OUT WHAT THOSE PLANS LOOK LIKE AND HOW THE LITHIUM IS EXTRACTED THROUGH PIPELINES AND SO. OF COURSE THAT IT LOOKS A CERTAIN WAY IT HAS A CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT A- CHILLER SELLS MOST OF ITS- MY UNDERSTANDING FROM THAT TRIP IS THAT SHE'LL ALSO SELLS MOST OF ITS- LITHIUM TO CHINA SO AGAIN THERE'S THE COMPETITIVE NATURE OF. OF WHAT THAT MARKET LOOKS LIKE AND WHAT THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR CALIFORNIA LOOK LIKE AND I WOULD BE VERY INTERESTED IN AND KNOWING A LITTLE BIT MORE. OF THE SOME OF THE EXTRACTION METHODS- THAT. CAN LOOK VERY DIFFERENT AND ARE MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY SOUND AND FAMILY THAT WOULD THAT WHAT I SAW IN CHILE SO THINK THANK YOU FOR THAT. WHAT IS THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE LIKE TO EXPLORE WITH THE LIFFEY VALLEY COMMISSION IS. ACTUALLY A SITE VISIT- FOR INTERESTED MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE TO GO TOGETHER AND BRING. SOME OF OUR EXPERTS SPOTTED A BUNCH OF THESE- DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS. DONE I THINK I LOOK HEREFROM. A COUPLE THE DEVELOPERS WHO ARE WORKING ON THESE TECHNOLOGIES. THE ACTORS WHO CAN SPEAK TO THAT BUT THAT'S SOMETHING WE LOOK TO. TO GO DOWN TOGETHER- FOR ANY. MEMBERS THAT ARE INTERESTED TO SEE. A DOCTOR SAM. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I WOULD WORK SO TO EXTEND THAT IN. TO MY CAR. UP IT. GETS A HUNDRED FORTY FIVE DEGREES OUT THERE SO. I WILL TRY TO PULL THAT OFF- EITHER SPEAK FOR OR AFTER- THAT TIME. I WANT TO THANK ALL THREE OF YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY- AND- SETTING THE TONE FOR THIS CONVERSATION- THE NEXT THAT PERSON WILL BE TALKING ABOUT. LITHIUM VALLEY THE ACTUAL REGION BY THE CEO OF IMPERIAL COUNTY. WE WILL HAVE BEEN. ANOTHER GROUP OF PANELISTS WHO WILL BE TALKING ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF COMMUNICATION MIX- THAT MIGHT BE ABLE TO ANSWER A LOT OF THE QUESTIONS. THAT HAVE COME UP WITH THIS SPECIFIC. DISCUSSION SLEPT ENOUGH. AFTER THE CEO AND I'VE KIND OF GONE. ALL RIGHT ON THE AGENDA WE DO HAVE ACTUAL- DEVELOPERS WHO WILL TALK ABOUT THE SPECIFICS OF THE TECHNOLOGY AND PEOPLE WILL GET THE ASSAM SPECIFIC QUESTIONS. ABOUT THAT SO WHAT THANK YOU AGAIN AND THAT WILL MOVE ON. WITH THE AGENDA WILL NOW INTRODUCE THE THIRD PART CALIFORNIA'S THIS YEAR VALLEY TWENTY WERE HOLDERS. JUNIOR IS A CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF IMPERIAL COUNTY HOME GROWN. AND SAYS SOMEONE WHO'S WILL KIND OF GIVE US AN OVERVIEW OF THE REGION. AND THEY CAN BE OPPORTUNITIES THAT THIS PRESENTS. WHICH CO WELCOME- THIS ELEMENT SEE IT YOU FOR THIS OP. TO SPEAK- FIRST OF ALL- BEFORE WE GET STARTED ON THE LITHIUM I THINK THE STREAMLINED BURDEN TO RECOGNIZE A PARTNERSHIP THAT- AND THE GREAT WORK THAT ASSEMBLY MAIN. MEMBER GARCIA HAS DONE THROUGH THE COLAVITA ACTIVITY HERE TO GROW COUNTY IS ONE OF THE- HARDEST REGIONS- STRICKEN BY A CODED UP. ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA HAS JUST DONE AN AWESOME JOB AND BEEN A GREAT PARTNER. AND- IT SEEN AS- ANY ASSETS OR ANY RESOURCES WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT HAPPENS AND IMPERIAL COUNTY. AND I THINK THE REASON I WANT TO BRING THAT UP IS BECAUSE- IT SHOWS THE PARTNERSHIP THAT WE DO HAVE AND WHAT WE WILL MAKE HAPPEN- AND THEN TURNED THINGS AROUND WITH THE SUPPORT. OF OTHERS- A ARE YOU ALSO MAY. LOOK LOCATION LOCATION SO LET'S JUST SAY IMPERIAL COUNTY IS THAT LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION SO LET'S MAKE THINGS HAPPEN. AGAIN MY NAME'S TONY ROAD IS PROUD TO BE THE CEO OF ACCOUNTABLE CARE. I'VE HELD THIS POSITION FOR- GOING ON FOR YEARS AND- PROBABLY THE COUNTY OF PREVIOUSLY- IN MY LIFETIME I WORK I WORK FOR THE COUNTY SINCE NINETEEN NINETY TWO ACTUALLY- IN THE- IN THE FIRE SERVICE SO- PROBABLY SERVE MY COMMUNITY. AND THE REASON- I'M PROUD OF IT IS BECAUSE I'M PROUD OF AND PRO COUNTY I'M PROUD OF THE OVERALL COMMUNITY AND WHAT WE BRING FORTH AND- IT'S JUST A GREAT PLACE TO LIVE HOWEVER WE DO HAVE SOME CHALLENGES- I CALL THEM PEARL COUNTY MY ENTIRE HOME. AND IT WITNESSED A COMMUNITY STRENGTH AND UNIFIED DESPITE MANY LONGSTANDING ISSUES. AND CHALLENGES SCOLDING SUMMERS AND I HEARD A HUNDRED FORTY FIVE DEGREES AND I'LL LET YOU GUYS KNOW IT'S NOT A HUNDRED FORTY FIVE DEGREES BUT IT WILL BE A HUNDRED NAY BY NEXT WEEK SO ANYBODY DOING VISIT YOU WANT TO HURRY UP AND- MAKE THAT HAPPEN. MOST RECENTLY- DEVASTATED BY THE IMPACTS OF CODED NINETEEN WE ARE COMMUNITY- THAT HAS FOR DECADES BEEN FACED WITH UNEMPLOYMENT LEVELS COMPARABLE TO AN ECONOMIC DEPRESSION AND BATTLE DECADES LONG ENVIRONMENT ISSUES ON BOTH SIDES OF OUR LARGE COUNTY WELL KNOWN PRO COUNTY AS A LARGE COUNTY- SPARSELY SPREAD OUT OF PROVIDING SERVICES BUT PROVIDING A QUALITY OF LIFE OVER A LARGE COUNTY CAN BE. QUITE DIFFICULT- FROM OUR SOUTHERN AND WE WELCOME OF SOME OF THE MOST POLLUTED RIVERS IN NORTH AMERICA AND TO OUR NORTHERN END WITH THE SEA EVAPORATING AND LEAVING FIND US THAT WILL FIND ITS WAYS IN THE LUNGS OF CHILDREN AND FAMILIES- HABITING AREA AROUND. ALTHOUGH THESE ARE JUST A COUPLE OF THE MANY ISSUES THAT SPAN DECADES AND NOW MY ENTIRE LIFE AND PRIOR TO THAT. I THINK IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE THAT THERE ARE MANY INTO COUNTY WHO FILLED THAT ROLE- WE HAVE BEEN UNSEEN UNHEARD. AND QUITE FRANKLY FORGOTTEN- BY INDIVIDUALS AT CERTAIN TIMES. BUT THESE ARE THE SAME INDIVIDUALS THAT MAKE DECISIONS. THAT CAN BE RESPONSIBLE TO CREATE POSITIVITY THAT WILL BE IMPACTING OUR QUALITY OF LIFE HERE IN THE REAL NEAR FUTURE. THAT'S NOT TO SAY WE THIS IS TRUE OR NOT TRUE- I THINK WE WITH THIS- HEARING TODAY SHOWS THAT WERE ON THE PROPER DIRECTION OF THE POSITIVITY OF THINGS TO COME. BUT WHEN INDIVIDUALS ARE BORN INTO A COMMUNITY WITH THESE ISSUES IT FILLS UP THERE'S LITTLE PROGRESS IS BEING DONE AS YEARS AND YEARS GO BY. IT'S EASY TO IMAGINE WHY ONE WOULD FEEL THIS WAY. AND WE NEED TO CHANGE THAT AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY. FOR ME AS A COUNTY CEO LET THE M. ISN'T JUST A CHANCE TO EXPAND OUR RESERVES OR CREATE JOB OPPORTUNITIES. WITHIN MY DEPARTMENT. WE'RE WILLING TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. AND WE'RE NOT WILLING JUST TO CREATE JOBS WILL AND ALSO HELP ASSIST PEOPLE LEARN AND- BE THOSE JOB- APPLICANTS- GIVE THEM THE- KNOW HOW GIVE THEM THE RESOURCES DISK SUCCEED IN THOSE JOBS AND WE'LL DO THAT WITH OUR WORKFORCE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION. WE'LL DO THAT WITH OUR LOCAL AND CURL BELLY COLLEGE WE HAVE DOCTOR MARTHA GARCIA ON ON THE PANEL TODAY AND SHE'S JUST ONE OF THE ASSETS HERE AND IMPERIAL COUNTY THAT WILL DEFINITELY BE AT THE TABLE TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN. IT'S A PROSPECT OF AN IMPROVED QUALITY OF LIFE FOR EMPLOYEES FAMILY FRIENDS NEIGHBORS AND ALL THOSE WHO CONTROL COUNTY HOME. COUPLED WITH THE ABUNDANCE OF RESOURCES AT THE SALTON SEA KNOWN GEOTHERMAL RESOURCE AREA IS ALL MOTIVATES OUR BOARD AND MYSELF. TO PURSUE DEVELOPMENT OF INDUSTRY IN OUR IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF OUR RESIDENTS PROPRI PROVIDING JOBS TRAINING EDUCATION THAT COMES WITH INVESTING AND HUMAN RESOURCES AND SUPPORTING OUR COMMUNITY BY BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER FOR COLLECTIVE EFFORT AND ALLOWING THEM TO BE A PART OF SOMETHING WHETHER THAT'S TO BE A PART OF THE COMPANY THE ORGANIZATION ADMINISTRATION. WE'RE JUST HOPING TO PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THOSE WHO HAVE SPENT THEIR LIVES JUST HOPING TO NOT BEING SUCCESSFUL BUT HAVING A CHANCE FOR THAT SUCCESS AND BEING PART OF THE OVERALL PLAN BEING DEVELOPED TO DISCUSS TODAY. OPPORTUNITIES ARE FAR INVOLVED FAR FEW AND FAR BETWEEN HERE AND IMPERIAL COUNTY. BUT I'VE LIVED HERE AND WORKED HERE LONG ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT WHEN ONE DOES APPEAR. WE WILL TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE. AND MAKE SURE THAT WE CREATE OPPORTUNITY. THIS IS WHY WE HAVE INVESTED SO MUCH TIME EFFORT AND RESOURCES INTO BECOMING THE HUB FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY AND ARE WORKING DILIGENTLY TO ATTRACT INVESTORS WHICH INCLUDE ELECTRIC CAR BATTERY MANUFACTURERS AND THOSE WHO CAN MAXIMIZE OUR VAST NATURAL RESOURCES. AND AVAILABLE AND READY WORKFORCE. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE PLAYED A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN RENEWABLE ENERGY INDUSTRY WITH NUMEROUS SOLAR WIND AND GEOTHERMAL PROJECTS IN THE COUNTY. WE KNOW THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO PLAY A MUCH BIGGER ROLE. IN THE RENEWABLE ENERGY FUTURE OF OUR GREAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA WITH A LITHIUM AND OTHER MINERALS MINERAL RECOVERY. EFFORTS. BENEFITS CAN EXTEND A G. COMMUNITY ALSO NOT JUST THOSE DIRECTLY GAINING FROM A NEW JOB LIKE CONTROL COUNTY PUBLIC BENEFIT PROGRAM WHICH MAXIMIZES THE BENEFITS OF SOLAR DEVELOPMENT ENERGY AND IMPERIAL COUNTY. WE'VE SEEN THIS- LOVES OUR LOCAL EFFORTS AS WHAT WE'VE DONE WITH OUR- COMMUNITY BENEFIT MONIES THAT WERE- GATHERED THROUGH OUR SOLAR DEVELOPMENT HERE IN A PRO COUNTY. AND WE'VE INJECTED- AND REINVESTED OVER THIRTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS BACK IN OUR COMMUNITY OUR OUR COMMUNITY BY SUPPORTING VARIOUS PROJECTS SUCH AS INFRASTRUCTURE. MANUFACTURING PARKS AND OTHER GREAT ENDEAVORS. JUST RECENTLY WE USE SOME OF THAT MONEY TO REINVEST IN THEIR BUSINESSES- RESTAURANTS AND TO OUR LOCAL CITIZENS BY ASSISTING WITH COSTS THAT WERE INCURRED DURING TO THE COBIT NINETEEN PANDEMIC. THAT'S HOW MUCH WE BELIEVE IN OUR COMMUNITY AND WE KNOW WE NEED TO REINVEST. TODAY I KNOW YOU'RE GONNA GET NUMBERS DATA AND INFORMATION REGARDING STUDY AFTER STUDY THROWN AT YOU. BUT I HOPE THROUGHOUT TODAY'S HEARING YOU DON'T FRGET THAT ALL THE STATISTICS DON'T TRANSLATE TO WHAT'S INVESTING AND TO LET THEM AND OUR REGION. AND WHAT IT CAN DO FOR THE PEOPLE OF OUR COUNTY OUR STATE AND OUR BI NATIONAL REGION. A REGION THAT THOUGH IS RESILIENT IS STILL IN RECOVERY. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK BEFORE YOU I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE PEOPLE AT HEART. AND I HOPE TODAY CAN SPUR ACTION THAT IS MUCH NEEDED. AND HAS BEEN LONG OVERDUE ALONG COMING FOR THE PEOPLE OF ONTARIO COUNTY. AND AGAIN AS NOT JUST A- COMMUNITY LEADER OF THIS COUNTY. BUT AS A RESIDENT SOMEONE THAT'S RAISE THEIR FAMILY IN THIS COMMUNITY. I AM HERE AS A PARTNER TO DO WHATEVER I CAN IN MY EFFORT SUPPORT MY BOARD. AND GIVE THEM THE PROPER DIRECTION TO SEE THIS COME TO FRUITION ERIN APPROACH CANDY AND SUPPORT THE EFFORTS MOVING FORWARD. THANK YOU. THANK YOU I MISS. A ROTISSERIE QUESTIONS SPECIFICALLY FOR- SEAL HERE. ALL RIGHT WE MIGHT GET BACK TO YOU- AFTER THESE NEXT SET A PRESENTER THANK YOU. AGAIN FOR MR WITH US. THE NEXT UP PORTION OF THE AGENDA HAS A LITTLE RECOVERY AND TECHNOLOGIES WE HAVE THREE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ACTUALLY DOING THE WORK OUT AND IF YOU'LL VALLEY REGION WE HAVE- JOHNATHAN WEISS GIRL WITH VICE PRESIDENT GOVERNMENT RELATIONS WITH BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY. ENERGY BROUGHT CALDWELL CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER CONTROLLED THERMAL RESOURCES AND DEREK BENSON CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER OF ENERGY SOURCE ALL OF THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE HERE WITH US TELECONFERENCING TODAY WE'LL START WITH THAT MISTER JONATHAN WIDESCALE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MORE MAKE SURE YOU CAN HEAR ME. GOOD WE OCT. I I DON'T HAVE A PREPARED STATEMENT WHAT I WANT TO DO THOSE KIND OF PLAY CLEAN UP HERE TO TRY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT HAVE ALREADY COME UP BUT LET ME TALK ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGY FOR LITHIUM PRODUCTION. THAT'S BEEN ASKED ABOUT HIM SOME TIME LINES AND SOME OF THE BARRIERS AND HURDLES- WE STARTED THIRTY FIVE YEARS AGO AS CAL ENERGY WE OWN AND OPERATE TEN OF THE ELEVEN GEOTHERMAL PLANTS. ADJACENT OF THE SALT SEA WHERE WE PRODUCE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MEGAWATTS OF GEOTHERMAL POWER WE'VE GOT TWENTY ONE GEO THERMAL PRODUCTION WELLS AND THEY PUT THEY BRING UP GEOTHERMAL BRINE AT TEMPERATURES AS HIGH AS ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED DEGREES FAHRENHEIT. AND THAT BRIAN IT'S A SATURATED SOLUTION OF MANY DISSOLVED MINERALS IT'S GOT IRON CALCIUM YOU KNOW SODIUM POTASSIUM MANGANESE MET. MAGNESIUM ZINC AND OF COURSE WITH HIM AND WE'VE BEEN PROCESSING FIFTY THOUSAND GALLONS A MINUTE OF THIS BRIAN FOR THE PAST THIRTY FIVE YEARS. TO PRODUCE THAT GEOTHERMAL POWER. NOW THAT BRIAN'S GOT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY PARTS PER MILLION OF LITHIUM- THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE A LOT BUT IF WE CAN RECOVER. THAT LITHIUM BY THE WAY I DON'T TALK ABOUT EXTRACTING IT I'M TALKING ABOUT RECOVERY AND WE'RE NOT MINING. A THOUSAND TIMES A YEAR IN A WORLD MARKET TODAY OF ABOUT THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND SO WE COULD EASILY SUPPLY AT LEAST A QUARTER OF CURRENT WORLD DEMAND THE TECHNOLOGY HAS NOT BEEN PROVEN ON A COMMERCIAL SCALE AND THAT'S BEEN THE BARRIER SO WHERE GOAL IS WE WANT TO CRAWL BEFORE WE WALK AND WALK BEFORE WE RUN SO WHERE GOAL WAS LET'S GET THERE ARE IN THE FUNDING TO BUILD DEMONSTRATION PLANTS. AT A ONE TENTH COMMERCIAL SCALE TO DO THIS WE CAN RECOVER LITHIUM IN THE LAB IT'S NOT ALCHEMY IT'S THERE WHAT HOW DO YOU PROVE IT UP AND SCALE. WE APPLIED FOR TWO SEPARATE COMPETITIVE GRANTS ONE FROM THE ENERGY COMMISSION AND ONE FROM THE U. S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY WE WANT BOTH OF THEM. A SIX MILLION DOLLAR GRANT FROM THE ENERGY COMMISSION. TO SHOW THAT WE CAN PRODUCE THE WITH HIM AND A FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLAR GRANT FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY. TO CONVERT THAT LITHIUM CHLORIDE INTO THE FEEDSTOCK FOR A BATTERY WHICH IS LITHIUM HYDROXIDE- WE WANT BOTH AND WE ARE MATCHING THOSE TWO GRANTS ONE OF SIX MILLION ONE OF FIFTEEN. WITH AN ADDITIONAL SIX MILLION AND FIFTEEN OF THEIR OWN FUNDS SO WHERE FORTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS INTO THE PROCESS. NOW LET ME GO THROUGH THE PROCESS REALLY QUICKLY FIRST THE BRIAN IS PROCESS FOR GEOTHERMAL DEVELOPMENT IT COMES OUT WE FLASH IT AT FIVE HUNDRED DEGREES. MEDIALLY COMES DOWN TO ABOUT TWO FIFTY. HOW DO YOU GET THE LITHIUM HAVE YOU SEPARATED FROM THE BRINE. WE GOT WHAT'S CALLED A I. ONYX. TECH THINK OF IT KIND OF IS AMONG AMONG. SIEVE THAT. LIKE EXTRA THE LISTING. BUT REJECT REJECT THE OTHER METALS THE IMPURITIES THE ONES LIKE TICKED OFF THE MAGNESIUM THE IRON CALCIUM DISODIUM. SO THIS TECHNOLOGY CAN HANDLE THE HIGH TEMPERATURES IT CAN PRECIPITATE OUT THE LITHIUM- LEAVING THE IRON MAGNESIUM IN THE BRYANT AND REJECT THOSE OTHER METALS. THAT CAN GO BACK DOWN HOLE INTO THE GEOTHERMAL RESERVOIR WITHOUT PRECIPITATING THEM OUT. SO AT THE END OF THAT PROCESS WE'VE GOT LITHIUM CHLORIDE. AND THEN WE GO TO STEP TWO CONVERTING THAT TO LITHIUM HYDROXIDE. FOR WHICH WE'RE GOING TO USE ELECTROLYSIS SIMPLY USING AN ELECTRIC CURRENT- TO CHURCH DRIVE A CHEMICAL CHANGE TO GO FROM. CHLORIDE TO HYDROXIDE- AND BY THE WAY THE ELECTRICITY WILL USE WILL BE RENEWABLE ENERGY IT WILL BE A GEO THERMAL POWER- AND THEN WE WILL GO THROUGH MORE. PURIFICATION CRYSTALLIZATION AND THE LIKE TO TURN WILL THIS LIQUID INTO A POWER. POWER TIME LONG. YOU KNOW I WE WANT UNDER AND TO BUT ME TELL YOU THE KERR TIME THE DEMONSTRATION PLANNED FOR K. FROM THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION- WE WANT THAT THAT'S WE'RE GOING TO BREAK GROUND NEXT MONTH- IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS WE HOPE THAT WILL BE ONLINE BY JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO WITH THE U. S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY CONVERSION PLANT AGAIN BOTH DEMONSTRATION PLANTS ONLINE BY LATE TWENTY TWENTY TWO. IF THOSE ARE SUCCESSFUL- WILL THEN BEGIN. COLLECTING DATA PART OF THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY GRANT ALSO COVERS. THE DEVELOPMENT OF FULL SCALE COMMERCIAL ENGINEERING AND THE LIKE SO WE COULD BEGIN CONSTRUCTION AS AS EARLY AS TWENTY TWENTY FOUR BUT WE'VE GOT TO DO THE ENGINEERING AND PERMITTING- AND GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW THIS WORKS. WE CAN TALK ABOUT JOB CREATION LATER BUT OBVIOUSLY THAT WILL ALSO BE ARE QUITE SIGNIFICANT. SO- WE- WE THINK THAT SUCCESSFUL LITHIUM PRODUCTION CAN ALSO BE A CATALYST. TO pINDUSTRY SO WE'RE NOT JUST CREATING JOBS AND WITH THEM. BUT ALSO REDUCING THE PRICE OF GEOTHERMAL POWER IN A WAY WITH THEM CAN BE THE TAIL THAT WAGS THE GEOTHERMAL DAHLE. TO BE QUITE FRANK. GEOTHERMAL POWER CAN'T COME RIGHT NOW FOR COST WITH WIND AND SOLAR IT'S GOT TO RIFIC ATTRIBUTES ITS BASELOAD AS YOU HEARD IT CAN EASILY REPLACE DIABLO CANYON WHICH WIND AND SOLAR FARM CAN'T DO. BUT IT'S SIMPLY MORE EXPENSIVE IF YOU CAN GET THAT SECONDARY STREAM OF INCOME GOING FROM LITHIUM YOU CAN REDUCE THE COST OF THAT GEOTHERMAL POWER SO. WE SEE A LOT OF SYNERGIES HERE JUST WITH LOCAL BENEFITS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO REALLY EVEN GROW THE GEO THERMAL- INDUSTRY IN IMPERIAL VALLEY WHICH IN TURN CAN GREW THE LITHIUM INDUSTRY. NOW BARRIERS RISKS LET ME GO THROUGH THOSE QUICKLY. WE'VE REALLY GOT TO DE RISK THREE THINGS WE GOT TO THE REST OF THE TECHNOLOGY WE'VE GOT TO DE RISK THE PRODUCTION OF THE LITHIUM AND WE WANT TO DE RISK THE MARKET. SO DE RISKING THE TECHNOLOGY PRETTY MUCH COVER THAT WE NEED TO SEE ISN'T TECHNICALLY COMMERCIALLY FEASIBLE TO RELIABLY EXTRACT REAL LIFTING HIM FROM THIS BRIAN IN AN ENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE WAY. SO THAT'S THREE PARTS RIGHT THERE THE TECHNICAL THE COMMERCIAL AND THE ENVIRONMENT AND WITH THE SENATE ANY ENERGY COMMISSION GRANT WE'VE GOT TO DO THAT FOR UNDER THREE FOUR THOUSAND. DOLLARS A TON. WE'VE GOT PROOF PROOF OF CONCEPT WE'RE ON OUR% WAY SO LET'S GO TO DE RISKING THE PRODUCTION. ARE THE LAST GEOTHERMAL PLANT WE PERMITTED TOOK FOUR YEARS TO DESIGN AND PERMIT- WE CAN'T TAKE THAT LONG I MEAN A KEY OBSTACLE HERE WILL BE NEEDED GOVERNMENT APPROVAL WHICH- WE HOPE WE CAN EXPEDITE THAT PROCESS. THERE'S NO QUESTION THE COMMUNITY SUPPORT AND EARLY ENGAGEMENT WILL REDUCE POTENTIAL OPPOSITION POTENTIAL DELAYS AS WELL AS STATE AN INTERAGENCY COOPERATION AND STREAMLINING WOULD CLEARLY SPEED UP THAT PROCESS. I DO WANT TO SAY ON COMMUNITY OUTREACH WE HAVE ALREADY HELD ONE VIRTUAL TOWN HALL MEETING BACK IN MARCH WE HAD OVER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY ATTENDEES WE HAD OTHER MEETINGS. I ACTUALLY UNDER YOUR AUSPICES. MISTER CHAIRMAN WITH SOME OTHER IN FIREMEN JUSTICE GROUP. AND WE INTO TO HOLD A- PUBLIC- TOWN MEETING JULY. AND WOULD HOPE. INVITE AS MANY AS WE TO COME. OTHER DE RISKING THEIR WORK THAT GREAT WORKFORCE. WE'RE ALREADY WORKING WITH IMPERIAL COUNTY COLLEGE ON CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT WE NEED TO WORK ON INCENTIVES OPPORTUNITY ZONES ENTERPRISE ZONES LOTS OF DIFFERENT CREDITS BOTH AT THE STATE AND FEDERAL LEVEL. AND LASTLY WE'VE GOT TO WORK- ON ANCILLARY ISSUES- ROAD IMPROVEMENTS THINGS THAT YOU KNOW ARE THAT THAT WILL THAT WILL MAKE THIS WORK BROADBAND IMPROVEMENT- DOWN IN THAT AREA THAT WILL HELP ATTRACT THE WORK FORCE. AND THEN THAT THIRD DE RISKING YES WE GOTTA DO RISK THE MARKET- THESE ARE LONG TERM CONTRACTS WE NEED TO MAKE CLEAR THAT CALIFORNIA IS ON THE MAP FOR LITHIUM PRODUCTION- THIS THIS COMMITTEE IS GREAT- TO DO THAT THE LITHIUM VALLEY COMMISSION I THINK IS DOING THAT. I WOULD LOVE GOVERNOR NEWSOM TO LEAD A REVERSE TRADE MISSION BRING IN OFF TAKERS TO SHOW WHAT WE CAN DO AND MIND YOU WE'RE COMPETING HERE I MEAN THERE IS A THERE'S A RACE RIGHT. FOR LITHIUM AND IT'S NOT JUST AROUND THE WORLD WITH AS YOU HEARD FROM CHAIRMAN HOPE SHE'LL IT'S NOT JUST SOUTH AMERICA AUSTRALIA AND CHINA IT'S NOW GERMANY IT'S NOW THE UNITED KINGDOM AND IN THE UNITED STATES AS YOU HEARD ALREADY NEVADA. ARKANSAS NORTH CAROLINA SO THERE'S A LOT TO DO HERE LET ME JUST SUM UP AND THEN DELIGHTED TO TAKE QUESTIONS BUT- ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WAS ASKED WHY YOU KNOW WHY LITHIUM VALLEY. WHAT THE- FOR AND FOREMOST IT'S THE OBVIOUS ONE THE- IS. OF WE'RE OR NAY. THE O. FOR POWER WE'RE LOOKING AT A- ON CHECK. JUST PRECIPITATE OUT WITH THE IS AS CHAIRMAN OF DISK. SECONDLY WE TERM SUPPLY THERE'S A LEAST A SEVENTY FIVE YEAR SUPPLY PROP. LONG AND IT'S PROP THE LARGEST. LITHIUM RESERVOIR IN THE WORLD. SCIENTISTS ARE WORKING ON THAT AS WELL. NUMBER THREE THERE THERE IS A WATER NEED AND BE DELIGHTED TO ADDRESS THAT- IN ID IS AWARE OF THAT THERE THERE WILL BE A WATER NEED ON THE PURIFICATION. OF THAT. ION EXCHANGE TECHNOLOGY- THERE'S A GROWING SHIFT TO ELECTRIC VEHICLE PRODUCTION SO IN NORTH AMERICAN A RELIABLE NORTH AMERICAN SUPPLY. OF A CRITICAL ELEMENT LIKE LITHIUM- IS EXTRAORDINARILY IMPORTANT IN FACT. I WOULD ARGUE THERE'S EVEN A NATIONAL SECURITY CONCERN HERE ABOUT THE NEED TO PRODUCE LITHIUM WHICH AS YOU SAID MISTER CHAIR. WE'VE ONLY PRODUCED WOULD PRODUCE A TINY BIT. NUMBER FIVE THE LOGISTICAL ADVANTAGE YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT THAT FOR SOUTHERNCALIFORNIA. AND LASTLY THIS WILL BE THE MOST ENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE LITHIUM PRODUCTION IN THE WORLD ALREADY WE RETURN ERROR UNUSED BRIAN IT'S RECYCLED ITS RETURN TO THE RESERVOIR. WE WILL BE TAKING OUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY PARTS PER MILLION OF LITHIUM- IT'S A PHYSICALLY. TINY FOOTPRINT COMPARED TO SOUTH AMERICA WHAT YOU SEEN UP CARILLO AND WHAT WE SEE IN IN AUSTRALIA AND CHINA. DOESN'T USE THESE EVAPORATION PONDS AND THIS CLOSED LOOP RECOVERY WE THINK WE'LL AVOID THE SCARRED LANDSCAPE- THE TOXIC WATER CONTAMINATION. THE OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION THAT WE SEE AROUND THE WORLD AND AS I SAID LASTLY WE'LL BE USING RENEWABLE ENERGY GEOTHERMAL POWER FOR THE ELECTRICITY NEEDS WE HAVE. LET ME STOP THERE A BE DELIGHTED TO ASK ANY QUESTIONS THAT MIGHT COME UP THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT THANK YOU GOT THE WORLD OFTEN QUESTION ON. I SHOULD UNTIL THE LAST. AT JUMP FRIDAY ROCKAUTO. CHIEF OF COULD DOUBLE RESOURCES PLEASE. PRESS AT THANK THANK YOU CHAN AND MEMBER IT SAID PRIVY TO PRESENT YOU- PAMELA THE PUBLIC TODAY I ACTUALLY HAVE A- PRESS. HE OF WE CAN. YEAH WELL TO SHARE THAT. IS WITH. OKAY I BEGIN ALL SAY THAT I'M- I GUESS YEAH I LISTEN TO THE GENERAL- CONSENSUS OF THE MEMBERS AND YOU CHAIRMAN AND THE PUBLIC OUT PROBABLY LIKE TO REALLY HIGH IN ON ON- MORE THE ENVIRONMENTAL- SOME OF THE- ENVIRONMENTAL- BENEFITS I GUESS AND SO TO TRIED TO DISPEL SOME OF THE- THE ISSUES ABOUT- HAVE THIS IS ACTUALLY PRODUCE AND I THINK SOME OF THE- QUESTIONS BY. ASSEMBLY MEMBER CARILLO AND OTHERS HAVE BEEN BOUGHT OUT SO ABOUT TO JUST PROBABLY HìNH IN ON THAT THE PRESS. OF THE QUARTER BRUHL. SPECTRUMS I FIRST A LITTLE ABOUT THE HELL'S KITCHEN NOT WITH HIM COOPER WE ARE JOINED- BUT YOU HAVE TO AND ENERGIES. PROJECTS WE ACT WHAT THE BRING FILLED- DEVELOPER THAT'S- A TO THE SHORT OF LA ARE STILL ON THE- SUDDEN SEA THAT IS- SO WAY SORT STARTING SCRATCH AND I GUESS YOU KNOW WE- ARE LOOKING AT. MY WITH THE ALL HATE THE FACT MY SENSE IN A BAR FOR WEISS. STAGE ONE OF PRIDE IS A FORTY NINE POINT NINE MEGAWATT SINGLE PAL PLAN THE TWENTY PRODUCE TWENTY TO METRIC TONS YEAR. THAT COULD HYDROXIDE THAT'LL COME LAW TWENTY TWO THREE THE TWENTY FOUR- TOTAL REYES COULD- THIS IS A LARGE RESOURCE JONATHAN HIT ON. WE COULD ALL ONLY BE JUST L. A. C. UP TO THREE. THOUSAND TIME BE A L. C. AND- HUNDRED. OF POWER COULD IF. REPLACE THE EMPLOYEE CANYON- SO VERY LARGE SCUTTLED RESULTS. AND THAT'S UP LEAST- TO ABLE TO READ. STYLE UP AND SORT OF- WILL GO A QUICK AS- COMES ON BOTH- I'M GOING TO THIS TEAM BUT YOU OF SAY WHERE THE THEMES- SO YEAH OF. TO HOST CHILDHOOD ON THE- AMONG OTHER WHERE I THINK WE GOING TO HAVE A- POINT OF. YEAH WE'RE IN HOLIDAY SUPPLY K. HE- THIS IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT TO SAY IN THE ON THE SLIDE BUT- IT REALLY DEFICIT STUFF TO COME IN TWENTY TWO TWO TO TWENTY THREE ON A OUT OF HERE SO I'M JUST. FOR THE ADDED I TO DIE GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF GIVE. GIGAWATT HOURS AND- MEGA FACTORIES AND TEAR FACTORY. OR IN SOME OTHER AREAS THAT YOU COULD SAY HE- YOU KNOW THEY'RE VERY LARGE OPEN TOP- WHOLE BODIES. YEAH THIS ROCK HAS TO BE YOU KNOW IT'S BUT IT'S GENERALLY ABOUT 6% IN LITHIUM CONCENTRATION SO EVERY HUNDRED TONS OF ALL YOU MIGHT GET SIX TONS OF WITH HIM OUT OF THAT IN THE FORMS BUDGET MAIN. YEAH THIS OR IS A TRUCK IN TRYING TO THEN SHIPPED TO CHINA WELL SOUTH KOREA FOR POSTCRISIS APPROVED VERY VERY CRUDE PRICES. THE CARBON FOOTPRINT OF ALL OF THAT AND I'LL BE NEEDS TO COME BACK STATES TO- BATTERY MANUFACTURES THE SOUTH KOREA'S. VERY EXPENSIVE- THERE INTENSE PRICE SIMILAR- THINK OF THE MEN. THE CHASE TOUCH ON THIS UNITED IS I THINK. THE CALL. WHICH IS ON THE ON RIGHT HAND SIDE YOU SEE NOW TEN THE IALL THE VEPR. PA WHEN YOU. THE SIZE IN A CALM. HAS A LIST THAN ONE INCH OF RAIN A YEAR. AND THEY PONZI USING A ME HALF A MINUTE GALLONS OF OIL- PROVED AFTER. OR EVERYONE TIME BLITZ IN. COULD YOU SUCK IT I'S PROBABLY THE AND SUSTAINABLE- CATEGORY- THIS IS A IT'S BEING DONE FOCUS MANY. THAT IT'S VERY EFFECTIVE. COSTA TOM YOU KNOW OF AB. TO 12-1 A MONTH- A THEN A GUY IN THAT. SO WITH. IS GENERALLY CENTER- TO. ASIA FULL PLAY. PROCESSING. I'M SIMILARLY TO CO TWO SO YEAH THAT'S THE WAY USE IS MORE THESE LARGER ON- THE SEATTLE SET EVERY I GUESS THE- THE ON THE ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE. FOR EVERY ONE TIME PUBLIC HIM PROJECT THIS FORTY POINT NIGHT. OF TWO PRODUCED THAT'S A SPOT MAKES THE HARD. TO I READ THE I SHOWED- SIMPLY TO BRAUN NOTICED HOPPED.

MOVING FOR CALL NOW KIND OF NEW THAT WAY. WERE NEW HEARING THIS WHAT'S- DC BUT YOU SAVE IN A- GAS COMBINE CYCLE. YEAH JEFF. IS KNOW A THREE AND A MILLION TIMES. CO. TWO A POWERFUL- TONIGHT AND THAT'S JUST THE NATURE OF THE RESOURCES VERY- HIGH TEMPERATURE QUALITY MINERALIZED- RESOURCE. SIDE YEAH I DIRECTLY FOR HIM EXTRACTION- OR- RECOVERY. THIS TO CORRECTLY SO THAT. YOU IT'S A VERY SMALL PHYSICAL FOOTPRINT SUGGESTING COULD TO G. THERE'S NO OPEN MINING LOWER BACK RUSSIAN AT ALL YEAH THE BRIAN FICK BECOME FROM LIKE THE FEET BELOW TO THIS SEA RESUL- AND AS YOU KNOW- THESE PLANTS OF OPERATING FOR I THIRTY AYE TEASED. AND VERY S. JONATHAN ON A GUY. THE NIGHT TIME AND SO EITHER PRICES HE THAT'S A ONE- THE CHLORIDE AND LITHIUM PART DROPPED THAT WILL BE BEE GEES FROM THE VALLEY. PLEASE BETTER GRAPHITE THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT SO WE DON'T NEED TO A- AT TEN THOUSAND. A CARBON FOOT TO SAY A SHIP LOAD OF ALL ALPINE. HYDROPS SO AS I MENTIONED PALATABLE I 1100% RENEWABLE ENERGY IN STEAM AND POWER THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO AND IT'S ALL GREAT- SO WILL NEEDS. CO TWO EMISSIONS NOT QUITE THERE BUT VERY CLOSE. THEN FOR THE YOU KNOW WOULD USES MINIMUM. YOU KNOW IT IS AS JAY HAAS CHILD ON. YOU KNOW THIS IS- A CLOSELY SYSTEM WAIT WE HAVE WE SEE TO OUR MATHIS THAT IS STAYING THAT IN THE CAN SAVE IN THE PAGE DAY YEAH WILL AS I AM WORKING ON CAPTURE SOME OF THAT STATE BUT IT'S OF. MEAN MORTY- COMPARED TO ANY TOPIC PROP PRODUCTION OF COURSE YEAH A BATTERY IN AND- WHAT I MEAN. AND MAINTENANCE SAY TO FOR TO EXPLORE OTHER CITIES NEED TO CA LEAKING POD CYBER IS A BIG. TO ASSAULT IT'S A VERY EXPENSIVE PRICES PER THAT IN THIS SACKS CENTER TO JOHN PUT IT INTO IT PUTTING KATHY WILL. IF THE CATHODE PLAN MANY OF YEAH MAN IF FOR. WAS TO LOCATE RIGHT NEXT TO US WITH SEND UPON THROUGH THE WALL INTO TERMS- SO YOU COULD ALL OF THAT ALL OF THE NEXT COST TO DO OF THAT. THIS INDUSTRY JEFF SHOWS AND HOW WILL. THIS COULD- ALL WORK YOU KNOW X. ELECTRIC. WE SELL INTO THE GREAT NOW THINK THAT'S VERY WELCOME BY THE- YOUNG AGAIN CITY'S. THIS ARE NOT HOST EVERYONE WITH A PULLED OF BISOLA HOW IT IS JOHN TOUCH ON YOU KNOW WEEK READ THE- AND THIS LARGE. SO THE YOU KNOW THE BATHROOMS- AS MENTIONED PRODUCED IN REAL TIME. THE MINORITY PROCESS THROUGH ON EXCHANGE TECH BE AROUND THIS YEARS THE BATTERY FOR OF. IF IT WAS ACTUALLY PRODUCING THE WHOLE SECTOR OF ENVIRONMENTALLY. FRIENDLY SUPPLY CHAIN AND REMOVING TWENTY LINKS FROM THAT SUPPLY CHAIN AND TAXES AND EXCEPT WHEN YOU HAVE TO EXPORT TO REPORT AGAIN IT JUST DOESN'T SEEM TO MAKE SENSE. SO YOU KNOW THE LOCATION WHERE WE'RE LOCATED YOU CAN SEE HERE THIS IS ON ALSOP HELL'S KITCHEN SARGSYAN THE SOLVENCY IN THE BACKGROUND YOU CAN SAY THE- ISSUES WITH DUST AND POLLUTANTS ON ANOTHER THAT YOU KNOW ASSEMBLY MEMBER CASSIE OF THESE CRIED WORKABLE YOU. WITH ASPIN WORKING HERE FOR TEN YEARS WAS SAYING THESE RESEDA. ASIDE FAST UP TO FORTY YARDS A MONTH EXPOSING SOME SOME SERIOUS- YEAH I Y. DUST. ISSUES BUT ALSO EXPOSING A VERY LARGE ONE OF THE WORLD'S LARGEST IF NOT THE WORLD'S LARGEST LITHIUM- GEOTHERMAL BRINE RESOURCE SIDE AS WE DEVELOP A MASTER PLAN THESE I THINK TRY TO THINK ABOUT THIS IN THE IMAGE OF THE BOTTOM WHICH IS THE REGION ONE OF BUSH'S PLANS. HELLO THEY'RE VERY SMALL FOOTPRINT AGAIN THE KIND OF LIKE I DID SORT OF- FACTORIES AND FACILITIES IN AD LAND AND HABITAT ALL CONTROL BE MASTER PLAN A LITTLE BIT MORE LIKE A SUBDIVISION THAN YOU WOULD THINK OF. JUSTICE DAN ONLINE FINANCES IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY I WOULD BE VERY GOOD WHICH TO WORK VERY CLOSELY ON THE ON THE BALLOT COMMISSION AS A COMMISSIONER BUT ALSO. YEAH WITH A CHAIR HOUSE CHILD'S TAME A C. N. N. US D. W. WHILE THE STATE WOULD BE VERY VERY PROACTIVE IN THIS AND IT'S QUITE AN EXCITING. OPPORTUNITY TO SORT OF- TAKE ADVANTAGE AND TRY TO. BRING SOMETHING UP. GOOD AT OF THESE. SO I THINK UNITED OF THE THOSE SORT OF PATCH. OF COURSE INVEST IS A CO. PERMITTING PROCESS A YOU SEE THE IN TO THE THEY- IS VERY COMPLEX IN THE SENSE WITH BY FORGOT THE FADES- YOU KNOW THE ACCORDING TO NEEDS- YEAH WITH SIX SIGMA PROCESS AND- YEAH WE ABSOLUTELY IT HE HAD ALL OF THAT BUT I THINK THAT THEY SAID THE OPPORTUNITIES. WHERE THE YOU KNOW THE CALIFORNIA ADMINISTRATIVE PROVE THAT COULD APPROVING YOU SINGLE CATEGORY TENSION COMMITTEE AND PROJECTS- CERTAINLY ON THE TABLE FOR THE BALLOT COMMISSION- YEAH THE C. EQ AT FEDERAL LEVEL AT THE YEAH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE CAN-CERTAINLY ASSIST WITH THAT. THAT WOULD FAST TRACK- CERTAINLY THE CORE RIGIDITIES. IN THIS PROCESS AND MOVING FORWARD.AND- YOU KNOW A LOT OF- YEAH THE OPPORTUNITY- OPPORTUNITY FOR ENTERPRISES ON SO TO SPEAK I'VE BEEN ABOUT. NOT JUST- THE STAND ALONE A GUY IN THE TEAM PRODUCTION PLANT BUT AN OVERRULE SECTOR IN BUSINESS SAYS AS MR ROUGHEAD IS MENTIONED YOU KNOW IT'S IMPROVE VALUES OLD ABOUT THIS OF THESE ORGANIC OPPORTUNITY HE NOW WHERE WE'RE IN LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION- WE HAVE RAFEAL WE HAVE ROAD WITH. INDUSTRIAL LAND YOU KNOW- WE HAVE A VERY A RELIABLE WORK FORCE AND THIS IS A NEW TAX PRICE UNITED STATES CALIFORNIA. NOTHING THAT HE ORDERED US AUTO INDUSTRY IS CERTAINLY LOOKING AT THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY AS WELL WE JUST NEED TO SORT OF- ALIGNED. THE STYLES AND GET GOING. SO JUSTIN IN. FINALIZE THE MEN OUT. A LIABLE WILL- EMPLOYEE INCLUDING CONSTRUCTION JOBS JUST UNDER TWO THOUSAND JOBS FULLY DEVELOPED. THAT'S JUST US INTO A JOB TO TWO AND A HALF THOUSAND. THAT EXCLUDES- BATTERY MANUFACTURING SO I THINK THERE'S A REAL PUSH FOR THAT NOW AND THAT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT BUSINESS YOU KNOW ONE OF THESE PLANS WOULD PLAY UP TO. TWO TO THREE THOUSAND PEOPLE. I WOULD PRODUCE A LOT OF BY SLIDE- YEAH INDIRECT- HOLD DIRECT ECONOMIC IMPACTS FOR US YOU KNOW THAT THREE AND A FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS SIDE. AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT SIMILAR TO WHAT JONATHAN- IT'S MENTIONED WE'VE BEEN ACTIVE IN THAT ROLE WILL CONTINUE TO BE A PART OF THAT. PART OF THE MASTER PLAN PUBLIC- YEAH COMMUNITY- THAT INVOLVEMENT IS VERY VERY FIRST UP FIRST AND FOREMOST TO THAT SIDE. WITH THAT IDEA THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. TO TAKE THANK YOU MR CALL- WE WILL GO ON TO THE NEXT PERCENT OR DEREK. DEREK BENSON CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER OF ENERGY SOURCE WE WILL SAVE QUESTIONS. FOR THE- PANEL AFTER THIS LAST PRESENTATION I THINK WE'RE DOING GOOD TIME. JUST WANTED TO- TAKE NOTE OF. THAT SO THANK YOU THANKS FOR CENTER. GOOD ACTORS ASSEMBLY GARCIA A MEMBER- MY NAME IS THERE AND- CHIEF OP ON. FOR ENERGY SOURCE MINERALS AND- PRE SHOULD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK. UP I THINK THE TO. YOUR PREVIOUS SPEAKERS- COVERED A LOT OF GROUND- I THINK I'LL TAYLOR MINE TOO MAYBE COUPLE LITTLE SUBTLE DIFFERENCES BUT I THINK THERE'S A COMMON THEME- HERE WITH WITH GEOTHERMAL- BRIAN AS A AS A CERTAINLY AT AN ENVIRONMENTAL ADVANTAGE OVER THE CURRENT STATE OF THE INDUSTRY. A LITTLE BACKGROUND ON ENERGY SOURCE MINERALS- WE'RE BASED IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA- WE HAVE OPERATING PERSONNEL HERE IN IMPERIAL COUNTY- AS WELL AS SOME FOLKS IN IN SAN DIEGO- WE WERE THE DEVELOPER OF. THE U. S. GEOTHERMAL FACILITY DOWN HERE IN THE SOUTH AND SEE THAT'S THE FEATHER STONE PLANT. WE CONTINUE TO OPERATE THAT FACILITY. AND WE'VE ADDED- YOU KNOW CAPACITY TO OUR TEAM AND OUR DEVELOPING- YOU KNOW WHAT WE BELIEVE WILL BE THE FIRST PROJECT TO COMMERCIAL EXTRACT WITH HIM FROM THAT GEOTHERMAL BRINE. I THINK- BY JONATHAN ROSS TOUCHED ON THIS AND PM G. OF THE RYAN IS NEW- IT IS COMPETE AND A GLOBAL GLOBAL MARKET PLACE BUT I THINK THE TECHNOLOGY- THERE ARE DIFFERENCES I THINK BETWEEN WHAT WE'RE PURSUING BUT I THINK IT. AS A WHOLE- THIS WILL BE- THE CLEANEST LITHIUM- AND CERTAINLY OUR PROCESS WE'VE PUT IT UP AGAINST- YOU KNOW THE OTHER RESOURCES THROUGH. AN INDEPENDENT STUDY- AND SO I'LL SPEAK TO THAT HERE IN JUST A SECOND BUT IS PART OF THIS PROCESS I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S THAT'S INHERENT AND ONE OF THE REAL ADVANTAGES EVEN THOUGH WE ARE EXTRACTING. A HUGE AMOUNT OF THERMAL ENERGY OUT OF THE BRIAN TODAY- THERE'S STILL A LOT OF ENERGY IN THAT AND THAT REALLY DOES HELP DRIVE TO. THE THE LITHIUM RECOVERY PROCESS AND IT MAKES IT MORE EFFICIENT- IF YOU'VE BEEN OUT HERE AND HAVE YOU BEEN OUT HERE YOU RECOGNIZE IT'S A PRETTY SMALL- PROJECT FOOTPRINT- AND IN FACT THE- THE WELL HEAD- THAT PAT IS GENERALLY ABOUT. YOU KNOW FIVE ACRES OR LESS SO YOU KNOW THE PICTURES- THE DESCRIPTION IN OR YOU HAVE AN OPEN PIT MINE THAT SEVERAL THOUSAND ACRES- AND EVAPORATION POND THAT'S YOU KNOW. ON THE ORDER OF MAGNITUDE OF YOU KNOW. YEAH FIFTY A HUNDRED SQUARE MILES- YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT VERY SMALL FOOTPRINT- WHAT. WHAT I THINK YOU'VE ALSO HEARD AND I'LL ECHO THIS IS ONE OF. THE SALTON SEA IS ONE OF THESE RARE RESOURCES IN THE WORLD. WHERE YOU HAVE GEOTHERMAL BRINE AND COMMERCIALLY. VIABLE QUANTITY OF LITHIUM AND THAT THAT JUST DOESN'T EXIST IN A LOT OF PLACES SO THERE UNITS CALIFORNIA'S EXTREMELY FORTUNATE AND I THINK IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY- FOR US HERE TO ENERGY SOURCE MINERALS TO WHAT I THINK MAKE IS THE MOST SUSTAINABLE. AND ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY METHOD OF MINING- LITHIUM SO WE COMMISSION AN INDEPENDENT LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT AND I THINK- A LOT OF YOU WILL APPRECIATE. THAT YOU KNOW THE TRANSITION TO ELECTRIFICATION- YOU KNOW IS INHERENTLY. A NET POSITIVE BUT AT THE END- PRODUCT USERS ARE ALSO LOOKING FOR YOU KNOW AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT GOES INTO ALL OF THEIR PRODUCTS AND WHAT'S THAT WHAT'S THE FOOTPRINT OF THAT WAS. SO WE COMMISSION AN INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENT AND WE LOOK AT- PARTICULARLY GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS WATER USE AND THESE LAND REQUIREMENTS. IN OUR APPROACH SPECIFICALLY- YOU KNOW WE'VE WE SPENT A LOT OF YEARS DOING OUR OUR PILOT WORK. OF ENGINEERING AND- YOU KNOW WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE ADMISSION RATES- FROM OUR PROJECT- UP AGAINST THESE HARD ROCK RESOURCES WERE ABOUT 90% LOWER SO FULL ORDER OF MAGNITUDE LOWER ON EMISSIONS- WE LOOK AT WATER USE- IT'S THE SAME. YOU KNOW A FULL ORDER OF MAGNITUDE AND A EXISTING TECHNOLOGIES. AND THEN- WHEN WE LOOK AT AND COMPARE OURSELVES TO SOME OTHER- SELECTIVE LITHIUM EXTRACTION TECHNOLOGIES- WE HAVE A TECHNIQUE AND A METHOD THAT'S THAT'S EXTREMELY EFFICIENT WITH RESPECT TO- THAT WATER USE- AS WELL AS REAGENT CONSUMPTION AND ENERGY. AND SO- YOU KNOW I THINK THE MESSAGE HERE YOU KNOW I SORT OF ECHOES THE GROUP BUT ALSO TAKE IT A STEP FURTHER AND SAY YOU KNOW WE FOUND A WAY TO MAKE THIS IS JUST AS EFFICIENT. AS POSSIBLE AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT- BOTH ECONOMICALLY BUT ENVIRONMENTALLY YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A PROCESS THAT'S IT'S GOT THE YOU KNOW THE LOWEST INPUTS- POSSIBLE PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO ENERGY. SO AGAIN I YOU KNOW I CAN'T EMPHASIZE THAT YOU KNOW THIRTY ACRE PROJECT SIZE YOU KNOW VERSUS A HARD ROCK OPERATION IT MIGHT BE THREE THOUSAND ACRES OR UPON EVAPORATION PROCESS LIKE THOSE IN SOUTH AMERICA WHICH WOULD BE YOU KNOW YOU KNOW THIRTY THOUSAND. ACRES OR MORE SO. YEAH WE DEFINITELY AGREE ELECTRIFICATION OF TRANSPORTATION CAN DELIVER SOME REAL ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS TO QUIT THAT POWER IS RENEWABLE LIKE WE HAVE YOUR RIGID THERMAL. AND IF THOSE BATTERY MATERIAL FEEDSTOCKS ARE SOURCED FROM THE MOST SUSTAINABLE RESOURCE TYPE AND WE BELIEVE THAT'S GEOTHERMAL. LITHIUM AND IT LEADS YOU KNOW I THINK IN EVERY ENVIRONMENTAL METRIC YOU KNOW BY HEAD AND SHOULDERS. BUT OTHERS HAVE ECHOED IT- LEVINE IS GLOBALLY COMPETITIVE WE'RE COMPETING ON PRICE WE'RE COMPETING ON PRODUCT QUALITY. BATTERY CPAC WITHIN HYDROXIDE OR LITHIUM CARBONATE- IS NOT A COMMODITY CHEMICAL LIKE SOME MIGHT HAVE YOU BELIEVE IT IS IT'S A VERY BESPOKE- PRODUCT. AND IT'S VERY HARD TO MAKE- IT REQUIRES A LOT OF QUALITY CONTROL. AND YOU KNOW WE'RE COMPETING WITH FOLKS THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE VARIOUS SHADES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHARACTER AND SO IT'S- IT'S DEFINITELY CHALLENGING MARKET. AND ONE WHERE YOU COMPETING ON ON EVERY METRIC. MANY OF YOU KNOW IT WILL COME A SURPRISE YOU KNOW CONSTRUCTION COSTS OPERATING COSTS IN THE US ARE GOING TO BE HIGHER THAN MUCH OF THE WORLD. pAND IN CALIFORNIA. SO WE LOOK AT IT YOU KNOW THAT THAT JUST PUTS AN EXTRA CHALLENGE ON US TO BE AS EFFICIENT AS WE CAN AND THAT'S RELATED TO ENERGY RELATES TO WATER. UTILIZING THE MOST EFFICIENT TECHNOLOGIES AND GETTING THE LITHIUM RECOVERY IS AS HIGH AS WE CAN FROM A FROM A GIVEN PROJECT AND SO. THAT'S THE TECHNOLOGY THAT'S THE PACKAGE WE'RE BRINGING TO THE SALTON SEA- YOU KNOW TO BE SORT OF THE BEST STEWARD OF THE RESOURCE- AND PRODUCE THE BEST PRODUCT WE CAN. TO COMPETE IN A AND A AND A BALLING. YOU KNOW BATTERY MARKET- I THINK. YOU GIVE ME A SENSE OF SCALE I THINK NOMINALLY OUR PROJECT IS. TWENTY THOUSAND TONNES PER ANNUM- YOU KNOW JOHNSON SPEAKING OF THEIR THEIR FACILITIES ARE. YOU KNOW ORDER MAGAZINE MAYBE ABOUT SIX TIMES THE BRIAN SO BRIAN FLOWING TODAY'S YOU KNOW WELL OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND TIMES- FOR YEAR OF BATTERY GRADE- DILITHIUM- CARBONATE EQUIVALENT AND- YEAH THAT'S THAT'S A GLOBAL RESOURCE. TODAY BUT THOSE THOSE NUMBERS ARE YOU KNOW EXPECTED SHIP. AND DEMAND FOR LITHIUM IS YOU KNOW INCREASING. YOU KNOW TO WELL OVER A MILLION TONS BY THE TWENTY. TWENTY SEVEN TWENTY TWENTY TIME FRAME SO IT'S- IT'S A HUGE MARKET AND- I THINK. EVERY RESOURCE MATTERS AND I THINK IT'S A SPECIALLY TREATED GET. SOMETHING WITH HIM AND SAID THAT- RATHER THAN MAYBE REHASH SOME OF THE OTHER TOPICS BECAUSE I THINK THE FIRST YOU GUYS COVERED A LOT OF THE- THE MATERIAL WELL. I THINK IT JUST MAYBE WANT TO CLOSE HERE. BY SAYING- YOU KNOW THANK THE LEGISLATURE FOR THEIR SUPPORT FOR THE INDUSTRY THUS FAR. BACK IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN GOVERNOR-BROWN-SIGNS-MOORLACH-DATE-SEPARATION-BILL. ALLOWING THE C. C. EACH ISSUE ITS FIRST GRANT TO PROMOTE ADVANCED LITHIUM EXTRACTION- GOVERNOR BROWN- SIGNING MESSAGE THEN ON THE IMPORTANCE OF LITHIUM EXTRACTION AND- I THINK YOU COULD HAVE BEEN MORE RIGHT- AND AS THE VALUE AND IMPORTANCE OF LOOKING AT SELLING GROUND WE WERE ONE OF THE BENEFICIARIES OF THAT IT EARLY ENGINEERING. GRANT MONIES- WE PUT THAT TO GREAT USE YOU KNOW WE'VE FULLY ENGINEERED YOU KNOW OUR FACILITY CONTINUED ADVANCE THAT THAT PROJECT- BUT IT CERTAINLY YOU KNOW HELPED US- YOU KNOW EARLY AND EARLY IN OUR EFFORT- AND WE CONTINUE TO CHECK A BAT'S SO. AGAIN I THINK IMPORTANT REALLY EMPHASIZED THAT WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT CALIFORNIA'S WITHIN RESOURCE. FROM THE SALTON SEA IT IS IT IS A COMPLETELY. DIFFERENT RESOURCE TYPE AND A COMPLETELY ENVIRONMENT COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTAL. FOOT PRINT OF THAT WHAT YOU SEE FROM THE STATE OF THE INDUSTRY. AND IN SOUTH AMERICA AND IN WESTERN AUSTRALIA AND I THINK AS A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT- YOU KNOW TAKE COMFORT IN THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW IT CAN BE DONE BETTER AND- HERE. WE DEFINITELY INTEND TO DO THAT. SO THAT THANK YOU AND- HAVE ANSWER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MISTER BRANSON AND- THE TO FIRE- SPEAKERS. AT THIS I THINK- HAS BEEN VERY INFORMATIVE CONNECTED A NUMBER OF DOTS. I WOULD HOPE IN TERMS OF- MANY OF THE QUESTIONS A WESTERLY. AND PERHAPS SOME REMAINING QUESTIONS- THAT EXISTS ALL LAST ALL OPEN UP TO MY COLLEAGUES FOR. OTHER QUESTIONS. YOU MENTIONED THERE'S A STRIP MINE AND EVAPORATION PONDS. IT'S EXTRACTED THROUGH THE PRIME. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO HOW DOES THAT THE LITHIUM YOU GET OUT OF THE PRIME WITHOUT. EVAPORATION POND. NOT ADMISSIBLE IT SOMEWHERE. UNDER THE THOUGHT ABOUT LOVE. YOU KNOW LIKE A FINE IS THERE STILL LET'S SEE IF IT'S STILL IN MY REMARKS ON BUT IT IS IT'S HOW DO YOU GET IT OUT OF THE PIPE THAT'S WATER FLOWING THROUGH THE PARK. THIS NOT SHOW. THEIR DANCING HERE I CAN I CAN SPEAK THERE'S A COUPLE TECHNOLOGIES BOTH BEING TALKED ABOUT HERE CONSULTANCY. WE IS A HIGHLY SELECTIVE WITH THE OF THE ADS ARE MEANT TO PREFERENTIALLY PULL WITH THE ABOUT OF LATE AT THE BRYANT- SO THAT IS ONE METHOD I AN EXCHANGE- DO IT WITH A- AYE ON REPLACEMENT- METHOD- BUT BASICALLY- WHAT. THE CATEGORY OF TECHNOLOGIES WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE PREFERENTIALLY SELECT LITHIUM- OUT OF THE FLUID- THROUGH PASSING IT OVER MEDIA THAT IS- THIS EITHER IT'S OR MATT OR AYE EXCHANGE MEDIA. THAT PULLS A LIFT HIM OUT AND SO- IT IT IT SIMULTANEOUSLY WILL REJECT THE SODIUM THE CALCIUM AND OTHER MONOVALENT DIVALENT- I ON SO IF YOU LOOK AT YOUR PERIODIC TABLE YOU KNOW LITHIUM'S ON THE FAR LEFT AT THE VERY TOP- THE REST OF THOSE SODIUM CALCIUM MAGNESIUM ARE ALL. CLOSELY RELATED AND NEAR THEM CARE ACT TABLE LISTA SUMMARILY REJECTED AS YOU PASS THROUGH THIS THIS MEDIA SO IT'S A BIT OF ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY- BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT'S- YOU KNOW IT'S A TECHNIQUE THAT'S USED- IN A NUMBER OF OTHER INDUSTRY APPLICATIONS IT WOULD JUST HAPPEN TO BE TALKING ABOUT. LITHIUM HERE BUT YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S WATER SOFTENING OR- YOU KNOW WATER TREATMENT FACILITIES OR WHAT HAVE YOU IT IT BUILDS ON THAT- THAT TECHNOLOGY BASED. I'M NOT SURE WHO MIGHT ANSWER THIS BECAUSE IT BUT LITHIUM VALLEY AS AN OVERLAY. OF THE SALTON SEA. ARE IN PERIL COUNTY. THE WHEREABOUTS IS IT GEOGRAPHICALLY BECAUSE I KNOW THEY ARE REAL WELL BUT I. URGE YOU JUST AREN'T WE COME UP WITH THE NAME AND WE'RE CALLING IT LITHIA VALLEY BECAUSE IT'S TO THE WEST TO THE EAST THE SALTON SEA. THAT THAT WAS JUST TRYING TO GET OUT OF A GEOGRAPHICAL. MAP IN MY MIND ON THAT ONE. I THINK I THINK WE GIVE CREDIT TO DAVID HOPE SHE'LL FOR THAT ONE- THIS WAS ORIGINALLY SORT OF A BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION. ON LITHIUM AND THEN I THINK I THINK THAT THE CHAIR GETS CREDIT FOR TURNING INTO A WITH THE ENVELOPES. IT'S THE YOU CAN'T FIND IT ON A MAP. KNOWN RISK IT IS GENERALLY AT IMPERIAL VALLEY. KELLY AREA- THE GEOTHERMAL FACILITIES THAT YOU'VE BEEN HEARING ABOUT FROM THE THREE OF US. ARE LOCATED ADJACENT TO THE SALTON SEA. IN THE LOWER. SHALL EASTERN CORNER. OF THE STREET SO THAT'S PRETTY MUCH THE LITHIUM VALLEY. AREA AND I THINK. I THINK IT'S A GOOD OF BRANDING NAME BECAUSE- WE GOT SO WE CAN VALLEY IN CALIFORNIA AS WELL AND I THINK. WITHIN BELIZE KIND OF A GOOD NAME. BUT NO IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN OKAY WELL WE'LL GIVE THE CHAIR THAT BUT THAT'S WHAT I NEEDED TO KNOW BECAUSE I'VE TOWARD SOLVENCY. I'VE BEEN ALL OUT THERE SEEING THE OF. THE THERMAL. OF PLANTS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT DID CONSTRUCTION FOR THIRTY FIVE YEARS I ACTUALLY WORKED OUT THERE AND DO SOME CONCRETE WORK. BACK IN MY YOUNGER YOUNGER DAYS. OVER THAT BUT THE OTHER PART IS DONE I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO IT TORN DOWN HERE. COOPER FIRMLY LIKE YOU SAID A HUNDRED SEVEN I KNOW TO GET UP TO A HUNDRED TWENTY SO WE'RE GONNA DO THE TIMING PRETTY QUICK WHEN WE DO THAT SO IT MIGHT BE IN NOVEMBER MIGHT BE A CHRISTMAS PRESENT FOR US IN OUR OFF TIME BUT- I LOOK FORWARD TO THAT TOUR. THANK TAKE IS A MEMBER QUESTIONS WAS FROM TH THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- IN REGARDS TO THE- THE ENVIRONMENT AND THEN STAKEHOLDER INPUT IN THE AREA. I KNOW THAT IN THE SALTON SEA AREA THERE'S- TRAVEL COMMUNITIES THAT ARE THERE HAS THERE BEEN OUT REACH AND DISCUSSION WITHIN THE TRIBAL COMMUNITIES AS FAR AS- LOOKING AT AND WE TALKED ABOUT REGULATIONS AND PERMITS IN THE STATE IS ONE. OF FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS ALSO ONE ASPECT OF IT SO HAS THERE BEEN OUT REACH AT LEAST DIALOGUE GOING ON WITH THEM LOCAL TRIBES IN THE AREA OF NOW. WHAT WE'RE CALLING THE LITHIUM VALLEY. THERE THE LICKING VALLEY COMMISSION I DON'T HAVE IT AT MY FINGERTIPS BUT OF THE FOURTEEN MEMBERS I BELIEVE TO- OR WITH TRIBES ONE IS TOWARDS MARTINEZ AND I'M I'M SORRY I'M BLANKING ON THE OTHER- WHEN WE HAD OUR VIRTUAL TOWN HOLD WE DID INVITE. OTHER TRIBAL GROUPS- I'M ACTUALLY BASED IN WASHINGTON DC AND SPEND A LOT OF TIME AT THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY ON CAPITOL HILL. TALKING ABOUT LITHIUM RECOVERY- BECAUSE THE TRIBAL GROUPS ARE AN IMPORTANT PART OF THAT LOCAL COMMUNITY THE TORTOISE MARTINEZ TRIBE ACTUALLY. IS LOCATED WHAT KIND OF DIAGONALLY ACROSS THE SOLVENCY IN THE NORTHWESTERN CORNER. BUT THEY ALSO HAVE. HAPPEN TO BE UNDER THE SCHULTZI- BUT ANYWAY YES THERE'S A LOT OF COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT NOT JUST WITH THE TRIBAL GROUPS. OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE GROUPS AS WELL. THE REASON I'M ASKING IS BECAUSE- THROUGHOUT HISTORY THERE'S BEEN A DIFFERENT EXTRACT OF MINE'S DIFFERENT THINGS THAT HAVE BECAUSE- DETRIMENT ENVIRONMENTAL- HEALTH HAZARDS THOSE TYPES OF THINGS. THAT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IN THE IN THE FOREFRONT OF THE DISCUSSION. THAT WERE- DRESSING THOSE NEEDS IN THOSE CONCERNS ARE BEING HEARD- I'VE HEARD IN THE DIFFERENT PANEL DISCUSSIONS. OF HOW TECHNOLOGY HAS NOW MOVED FORWARD TO- CREATE MINIMAL EFFECT TO SOME OF THOSE- ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS BUT- LIKE MY OTHER COLLEAGUES HERE TOO WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE. MORE OF THAT AND HOW THAT'S GOING TO PLAY OUT NOW WITH THE TECHNOLOGY IS THERE. AND CONCERNED MAKING SURE THAT VOICE IS AT THE TABLE OF THE TRIBAL COMMUNITIES AND THAT PAST HISTORIES ARE GOING TO BE REPEATED AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN THIS DISCUSSION. R. WELL I THINK I CAN SPEAK FOR ALL THREE OF US BY THE WAY IT'S THE QUE HAN INDIAN TRIBE IS THE OTHER IT JUST SLIPPED MY MIND. BUT LET ME LET ME PUT THIS IN CAPITALISTIC TERMS AS DEVELOPERS WE HAVE TO DE RISK ARE PROJECTS. AND ONE OF THE WAYS YOU DE RISK AS YOU ENGAGE THE COMMUNITY YOU ARE TRANSPARENT YOU LET THEM KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING IT'S NOT JUST FIRING IT'S EXPLAINING YOUR TECHNOLOGY LIKE WE'RE DOING HERE. IT'S ENGAGING THAT COMMUNITY IT'S EXPLAINING THE ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS I THINK CHAIRMAN HOPE SHE'LL MAKE THE POINT AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF THE HEARING- YOU KNOW YOU LOOK AT. LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF EXTRACTIVE MINERALS WHETHER IT'S THE CONGO OR OR OTHER PLACES AROUND THE WORLD INDIGENOUS PEOPLES. I HAVE BEEN TAKING ADVANTAGE OF. THAT CAN'T HAPPEN HERE. AND I THINK THAT WHAT WHAT ALL OF US ARE LOOKING TO DO CERTAINLY SPEAKING FOR MY COMPANY BUT I KNOW FOR ANYONE ELSE WANTING TO DEVELOP IN THE AREA. IS FULL COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT- AND FULL DISCLOSURE FOLDERS TRANSPARENCY. LOCAL HIRING- AND THE LIGHT WHETHER IT'S TRIBAL GROUPS OR OTHERS COULDN'T AGREE WITH YOU MORE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER MARC. IS A GOOD QUESTION TO THE DEN GAS STOVES- TWO TRIBES SEE FORT YUMA CONFRONT INDIAN TRIBE. FIRST MARTINEZ. A TRIBE WERE BOTH APPOINTEES OF THE CVC PROCESS TO THE- COMMISSION AND WE'RE GLAD THAT THEY ARE. AT THE TABLE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM MY COLLEAGUES- THANK YOU SO MUCH. TO ALL THREE OF YOU WHO HAVE PRESENTED TODAY WE ARE VERY. GLAD THAT- WE WERE ABLE TO HIGHLIGHT. OF THE LITHIUM VALLEY CONCEPT AND THE AS A GOVERNMENTS A REAL TIME ACTIVITIES GOING ON. IN THE REGION- WE HEARD EARLIER IN TERMS OF WHAT THE STATE CAN DO TO HELP ADVANCE THESE EFFORTS- I GOT A GOOD. OF COMMENT FROM OUR CHAIR OF TRANSPORTATION IN THE ASSEMBLY WHO'LL I WAS INTRIGUED BY YOU KNOW THE PRESENTATIONS SHE GOT TO HEAR AND WANTS TO BE. A SUPPORTIVE AS SHE AS SHE MENTIONED THAT ON OUR WAY. OUT BUT THAT WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO THE NEXT- PANELED AND FINAL PANEL AND- THIS WILL HAVE TO DO WITH THE IMPORTANCE OF COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT. A VERY TIED TO THE LAST SET OF QUESTIONS THAT WERE ASKED ONCE AGAIN I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE. I STICK AROUND SOME OF THE QUESTIONS MIGHT COME UP THAT TO YOU MAY BE ABLE TO ASSIST US WITH. BUT AT THIS TIME WHY ASK OUR OUR FIRST PRESENTER FOR THIS FINAL PANEL STILL BE A POLICY IS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF ON THE OUTSIDE. AND THE CHAIR OF THE LITTLE VALLEY COMMISSION SHE WOULD BE FOLLOWED BY DR MARTA GARCIA PRESIDENT OF THE IMPERIAL VALLEY COLLEGE- PLEASE BEGIN. THANK YOU. GARCIA AND- TO YOUR COLLEAGUE SAW FIRST I WANNA REALLY ACKNOWLEDGE THE LEADERSHIP THAT ASSEMBLYMEMBER GARCIA HAS BROAD- IN ELEVATING. A REGION IN THE SALTON SEA AREA THAT HAS BEEN HISTORICALLY IGNORED AND SOMETIMES FELT AS A RELEVANT TO SACRAMENTO- AND ALSO THANKS TO THE COLLEAGUES HIS COLLEAGUES THAT HAVE SUPPORTED HIM BY EMBRACING THE VALUES OF EQUITY INCLUSION AND SUSTAINABILITY. AND IN DOING SO REALIZING THE TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY IN THE SALTON SEA REGION- LIKE THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MENTIONED- NOT ONLY DO Y. CHAIR THAT ANYTHING ABOUT THE COMMISSION. BUT I'M ALSO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF A NONPROFIT. THAT HAS BEEN WORKING ALONGSIDE COMMUNITY MEMBERS IN- EQUITABLE AND SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. TODAY I WANT TO GIVE YOU A BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO THE MEETING ABOUT THE COMMISSION. ITS WORK AND THE IMPORTANCE OF INCLUSIVE AUTHENTIC COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT. AS A NEW INDUSTRY IS BORN IN THE IMPERIAL. AND COACHELLA VALLEYS- I'D WE HAVE HEARD RIGHT THE TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY WITH THE LEAD THE- BEING A BY PRODUCT OF GEO THERMAL OF GIFTS AS A LOT OF ADVANTAGE IN THE POTENTIAL- COMMERCIALIZATION. OF LEAD THEM AND I BELIEVE THAT THESE ARE SOME OF THE REASONS WHY ASSEMBLYMEMBER GARCIA AUTHORED AB SIXTEEN FIFTY SEVEN WHICH CREATED THE LEADING ABOUT THE COMMISSION SO THAT WE CAN STOP TALKING ABOUT. THE SALTON SEA'S RENEWABLE ENERGY POTENTIAL AND INSTEAD CRAFT A ROAD MAP. TO THAT END SO THAT HE CAN VALLEY COMMISSION IS TASKED WITH REVIEWING INVESTIGATING AND ANALYZING THE POTENTIAL ISSUES AND POTENTIAL INCENTIVES REGARDING BEAT THEM EXTRACTION AND ITS USE IN CALIFORNIA. THE COMMISSION IS COMPOSED OF FOURTEEN MEMBERS THAT WERE APPOINTED BY A COMBINATION OF THE CC THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON RULES- THE ASSEMBLY SPEAKER AND OTHER STATE AGENCIES AND AS SUCH THE MEMBERSHIP IS DIVERSE AND IT REPRESENTS THE INDUSTRY- GOVERNMENT NATIVE AMERICAN. GROUPS NONPROFITS. AND ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE GROUPS. THE WAY THAT ICE THE TASK BEFORE THE LEVY VALLEY COMMISSION HOWEVER IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT HOW WE DEVELOP AND GETTING THEM TO MARKET BUT HOW DO WE DO IT IN A WAY THAT IS ENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE SUSTAINABLE. AND WITH DIRECT BENEFITS TO THE COMMUNITY SURROUNDING THE SALTON SEA. AND WE CANNOT ACHIEVE THIS IF WE APPROACH LEAD THEM DEVELOPMENT. AS BUSINESS AS USUAL WHERE THE BENEFITS ARE REAPED BY A FEW AND BUILT ON LOW WAGES ARE POOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONS. AS HAS BEEN RECOGNIZING COMMENTS DURING THIS CONVERSATION WITH HIM IS ABOUT MORE THAN THE ENVIRONMENT. IT'S ABOUT THE FUTURE OF OUR ECONOMY AND FOR THE LOCAL REGION WHICH HAS BEEN INEXPLICABLY HIT BY THE COLD AND DEMOCRATS IT'S ALSO ABOUT RECOVERY AND HAVING A CHANCE AT IT. SO WHAT SHOULD OUR NEW APPROACH BEING LEAD THEM DEVELOPMENT CANNOT HAPPEN BY ONLY HELLO ADDRESSING THE LEGISLATIVE BARRIERS THAT TECHNOLOGY INTHE SCIENCE WHICH ARE ALL IMPORTANT- BUT BY ADDRESSING THEM TOGETHER WITH THE COMMUNITY. AS AN EXAMPLE IT'S ONE THING TO SAY THAT LEAD THEM DEVELOPMENT WILL CREATE HIGH ROAD SHOPS BUT IT'S ANOTHER TO BE INTENTIONAL IN BUILDING THE CAPACITY OF OUR EXISTING WORKFORCE. THIS CAN ONLY BE DONEBY ENGAGING OUR RESIDENTS TO LEARN ABOUT THE BARRIERS THAT THEY FACE IN ACHIEVING ECONOMIC MOBILITY AND CALL CREATING PATHWAYS THAT WILL ADVANCE. ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES RATHER THAN IMPORTING LABOR. AS A LEADING VALLEY COMMISSION EXPLORE CENTER LIBERATES RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE VARIOUS ELEMENTS OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF FLEET THEM. SUCH AS THE MARKET OPPORTUNITIES POTENTIAL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS AND INCENTIVES. WE WANT TO BE CONSCIOUS ABOUT CREATING A PRODUCT ACTIS DAD WILL ENGAGE THE COMMUNITY IN IDENTIFYING. THE NEEDS. AS A THOROUGH NINE RIGHT SO WHAT DOES COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT LOOK LIKE WHEN WE ARE DISCUSSING BENEFITS WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE WHEN IT IS AS WE'RE DISCUSSING ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS. AND MAKING SURE AGAIN THAT WE HAVE THAT PRACTICE SO THAT WE'RE IDENTIFYING WITH THE COMMUNITY THE VERY IS- MEANS. NOT JUST OF THE REPAIRMEN ITS DEVELOPMENT BUT THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY AND THERE IS SOME OVERLAP IN SOME OF THE CONVERSATIONS WE'VE ALREADY HAD- WE'VE IDENTIFIED FOR EXAMPLE BARRIERS SURROUND INFRASTRUCTURE- FOR AT LEAST THE- AND IT'S AND THE ABILITY TO BUILD A SUPPLY CHAIN IN THIS REGION. WELL THOSE SAME INFRASTRUCTURE PROBLEMS ARE PROBLEMS THAT OUR COMMUNITY HAS BEEN FACING AND ADVOCATING TO IMPROVE FOR MANY YEARS- LAKE ROAD ST ACCESS TO BROADBAND AND PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION AND SOME OF THE EXAMPLES. SO WE NEED TO LOOK BEYOND OUR TRADITIONAL PARTNERS. AND ENGAGE THE MEMBERS OF THE IMPACTED COMMUNITIES IN MOVING THIS DEVELOPMENT ALONG SIDE US. I THANK EIGHTY NINE EIGHTY THREE- WHICH IS AUTHORED BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER GARCIA GETS SAYS- CLOSER IN THAT DIRECTION BY AUTHORIZING THE USE OF COMMUNITY WORKFORCE AGREEMENTS THROUGH A SUSTAINED ENGAGEMENT PROCESS WITH THE LOCAL COMMUNITY AND I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET- HAS DEDICATED RESOURCES FOR THE TYPE OF REGIONAL LEAD COMMUNITY PLAN MEANS THAT IS NEEDED IN ORDER FOR US TO REALLY ACHIEVE- ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN A WAY THAT IS INCLUSIVE AND EQUITABLE AND THAT UNDERSTANDS THE NEEDS AND THE LOCAL CONTEXT OF OUR REGION. SO I WILL LEND WITH THIS WHILE THE LEADING VALLEY COMMISSION IS DIRECTED TO ANALYZE AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE LEGISLATURE ABOUT HOW TO SUPPORT ITS DEVELOPMENT. THIS TASK SYSTEM THE CONTEXT OF A COMMUNITY THAT FEELS THAT THE STATE HAS UNDER DELIVERED ON CHALLENGES RELATED TO THE SALTON SEA. WHICH BRINGS TOGETHER PUBLIC HEALTH ECONOMIC JUSTICE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AND INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUES IF WE CANNOT DEMONSTRATE THAT THE TEN YEAR RESTORATION PLAN FOR THE SALTON SEA CAN ACHIEVE THE MULTI BENEFITS DESCRIBED IN THE STATE'S THIRTY BY THIRTY INITIATIVE. AND LEVERAGE OTHER STATE INVESTMENTS AS WELL AS THE FEDERAL BUILD BACK BETTER COMMITMENTS TO MEET OUR COMMUNITY'S NEEDS. I DON'T SEE HOW WE TELL THE PUBLIC THAT IT WILL BE DIFFERENT WHEN WE GET TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF ANYTHING. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- THANK YOU. A DOCTOR MARTHA GARCIA- WILL BE OUR NEXT BEAKER WE'RE DOING A GOOD ON TIME WE'RE GONNA HAVE SOME TIME FOR SOME QUESTIONS AS WELL HERE AS IT RELATES TO COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT SO- PLEASE A STATE STAY WITH US. DR MARGARET MARTA GARCIA PLEASE- PLEASE PROCEED. YOUR TIME MAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK THIS AFTERNOON. I ALSO ALONG WITH THE OVER HERE WITH US EXPRESS TREMENDOUS GRATITUDE TO ASSEMBLYMEMBER GARCIA FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND YOUR ADVOCACY OF THIS COMMUNITY IMPERIAL COUNTY. THAT'S ONE OF THE A HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN PUBLIC COMMUNITY. COLLEGE PRESIDENTS IN CALIFORNIA. LIPKIN PRESENTS AN EXCITING OPPORTUNITY FOR NOT ONLY FOR IMPROVE COUNTY BUT ALSO THE QUESTION ABOUT ONLY IN THE INLAND EMPIRE. IT PRESENTS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. HOWEVER AS A RESIDENT OF A DRUG CAL ME AS SOMEONE THAT WAS BORN AND RAISED IN THIS COMMUNITY AS SOMEONE NOT GRADUATED FROM POLY COLLEGE THIS INDUSTRY REPRESENTS HOPE FOR OUR COMMUNITY IT REPRESENTS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT NOT ONLY FOR STUDENTS BUT ALSO FOR COMMUNITY MEMBERS. AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT THERE WILL BE OPPORTUNITY FOR OUR COMMUNITY TO- OBVIOUSLY THROUGH EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR COMMUTE TO CONTINUE TO. DEVELOP AND AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ECONOMIC RECOVERY I WILL FOCUS ON SOME OF THE EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES AS THERE HAS BEEN SUBSTANTIAL COMMENTS ON THE BENEFITS OF LITHIUM UP THAT ARE HAVE ALREADY BEEN PROVIDED. WE HAVE AS STATED BY MR MY SCHOOL- STE. STARTED THE DISCUSSION IN REGARDS TO CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT BUT IT'S NECESSARY TO PREPARE THE FUTURE WORKFORCE- AND I UNDERSTAND THAT SOME OF THE EXPERIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE THAT WILL BE NECESSARY WILL BE RELATED TO ENGINEERING SUCH AS MECHANICAL INDUSTRIAL FABRICATION A LOT AND ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU ALL THAT WE ARE- FINALIZING A PARTNERSHIP WHICH SITE THESE. UNIVERSITY WHICH IS. LOCATED IN MEXICALI I ASKED WE ARE A COMMUNITY THAT OBVIOUSLY RELY ON EACH OTHER MUTUALLY MEXICO AND- AND IMPERIAL COUNTY H. SO WE ARE CREATING AN ENGINEERING TALKS WAY- AND IT'S ONE OF MANY OPTIONS FOR STUDENTS HOWEVER IT IS AN OPTION THAT WILL BE LOCAL WE- ARE PROVIDED. FOR THOSE THAT EXPERIENCE BARRIERS TO RELOCATING- BUT PLANT OPERATION WE NOW IN ITS KEY WELDING FABRICATION- I UNDERSTAND YEP TECHNOLOGY SPECIALLY AS THE EQUIPMENT- THAT IS WILL BE UTILIZED- SOME OF IT REQUIRES. THAT EMPLOYEES ARE KNOWLEDGEABLE IN AND TECHNOLOGY SPECIALLY AUTOMATION- INSTRUMENTATION. ADMINISTRATIVE AND ACCOUNTING. SO AS I STATED I REALLY BELIEVE THAT THIS INDUSTRY WILL CONTINUE WILL CONTRIBUTE TO ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND IMPROPER COUNTY AND THE SURROUNDING REGION- I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU ABOUT. PAYROLL VALLEY COLLEGE PREVIOUSLY HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE A PRE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM IN TWO THOUSAND NINE THEY DO A GRANT THAT WOULD SUPPORT AFTER THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION AS WE WERE PREPARING DISPLACED WORKERS- THAT WERE. BEING ARE TRAINED TO WORK AND RENEWABLE ENERGY. WE'RE READY TO DO THAT AGAIN- WE ARE COMMITTED. WE RECOGNIZE THAT IN THIS COMMUNITY IN ORDER TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE BETTERMENT OF OUR COMMUNITY HOLISTICALLY WE MUST WORK TOGETHER WE MUST DO WHATEVER IT TAKES- TO HELP OUR COMMUNITY. AND I SINCERELY BELIEVE DOT. AS THE DISCUSSION WITH HELP THIS AFTERNOON AND% THAT'S THE COMMITMENT THAT IS REFLECTED CHIU UP CONTRIBUTE CHIU RECOVERY NOT ONLY OF THIS COMMUNITY KATELLA VALLEY COMMUNITY AT THE STATE- THAT WE COULD DO IT COLLECTIVELY THAT THIS. OF LITHIUM THIS INDUSTRY I WILL BE AN ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTOR TO IMPROVE COUNTY BECOMING THE CAPITAL OF RENEWABLE ENERGY SO I'M COMMITTED ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES AND PROPEL THE COLLEGE WE ARE HERE AS A PARTNER TO DO WHATEVER WE CAN. TO PREPARE THE FUTURE WORKFORCE A BIT. OF THIS DENTISTRY THANK YOU. I YOU VERY MUCH A DOCTOR GARCIA AND- THIS WILL BE A BOSS I'M GONNA ASK MY COLLEAGUES TO SEE IF THEY HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. REGARDING YOUR PRESENTATIONS ANY OF THE POINTS THAT WERE DISCUSSED. AND AT THIS POINT I THINK SOME DEMOCRATS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MY QUESTION IS- I BELIEVE PRESIDENT GARCIA WITH THE IMPERIAL VALLEY COLLEGE UP MISS GARCIA CAN YOU PLEASE SHARE WITH US MAYBE SOME OF THE- OPPORTUNITIES WITH APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS THAT YOUR COLLEGE IS CURRENTLY UNDERTAKING AND WHAT THE OPPORTUNITIES MAY LOOK LIKE IN THE FUTURE. IF THE PROJECTS- FOR MORE OPPORTUNITIES RELATED TO LITHIUM WOULD LOOK LIKE FOR YOUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE WHICH I KNOW PERSONALLY PLACE A HUGE A SIGNIFICANT ROLE WITH UPWARD MOBILITY ACCESS TO GOOD JOBS. AT GOOD UNION JOBS AT THAT POINT ESPECIALLY IF THEY'RE AFFILIATED WITH- AN APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM AND WHAT THAT CURRENTLY LOOKS LIKE FOR YOUR COLLEGE. REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR QUESTION SO CURRENTLY WE DO HAVE AN APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM IN- ELABORATION WITH ID. IN ADDITION DISTRICT- WHEN IT COMES WHERE I SEE THE OPPORTUNITY THE COLLEGE. IS DEVELOPING PRE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS- ALSO WE ARE IN THE IN THE- PARTNER AND WORK CLOSELY WITH I. B. W. WHICH IS THE ELECTRICAL UNION. FOR US BUT I ENVISION AND IT'S AMAZING TO BE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION UP TODAY BECAUSE WE WERE ABOUT TO HIRE AT JUSTICES WERE ABOUT TO HIRE- AND ENGINEER WHEREABOUTS WHEN IT COMES TO THE FACULTY AND WHEN IT COMES TO RELATING- AND UNDERSTANDING. THE NEED FOR SPAM. COULD BE INCORPORATED INTO THESE POSITIONS- I SEE AND A VERY IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO CREATE NOT FOR CREDIT ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THESE COMPANIES WILL NEED ARE IN PLACE TO BE PREPARED IN A SHORT- THE- TERM OF PERIOD TO CREATE AND A NOT FOR CREDIT- PROGRAM THAT INCORPORATES ALL THESE COMPONENTS AND ADDS A PRE APPRENTICESHIP. BROKE GROUND IT WOULD BE. EASIER FOR US FOR US TO CREATE IT IN A SHORTER TIME PERIOD AND TO AND TO TAILOR IT TO THE NEEDS THE SPECIFIC NEEDS OF THE INDUSTRY- SO. WE'RE IT IS. AND WE'RE GONNA DO WHATEVER IT TAKES BECAUSE THIS COMMUNITY DESERVES THAT AND- AND I KNOW THAT MY FACULTY IS COMMITTED AND I KNOW THAT WE'RE HIRING THE FACULTY THAT HAS THE EXPERTISE TO SERVE THE NEEDS OF THIS SPECIFIC INDUSTRY. THANK YOU THANK YOU DOCTOR FOR THAT RESPONSE I'M GOING TO BUILD BUILDING QUESTION OKAY GOT SOME RUNS THANK THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN SORRY FOR THE DELAYED RESPONSE TO THE QUESTION BUT ONE OF THE QUESTIONS IS- WORKING WITH- IMPERIAL VALLEY COLLEGE- IF YOU'RE IN A PRIME POSITION TO BE ABLE TO PUT OUT TO THE COMMUNITY. AND DISPEL- ANY MIRRORS OR- MISCONCEPTIONS OF WHAT THE PROJECT AND HOW THE PROJECTS MOVING FORWARD- MEANING THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT THE MINIMAL IMPACT NEW TECHNOLOGY I'M HOPING THAT THE- THE COLLEGE WILL BE ABLE TO LEAD THAT EFFORT WITH THE LOCAL COMMUNITY. TO BE ABLE TO TRULY UNDERSTAND THAT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE PAST THIS IS A NEW BEGINNING WITH TECHNOLOGY ENVIRONMENTAL MINIMAL IMPACT THOSE TYPES OF THINGS SO I'M HOPING THAT THE COLLEGE WOULD BE ABLE TO SERVE AS A CATALYST TO EDUCATE THE PEOPLE IN THE AREA. SO ON BEHALF OF THE COLLEGE- WE'RE DEFINITELY. WILLING AND LIKE I- WILL RESTATE WHAT'S THE YOUR REGULAR THIS STATE AND- WE CAME TOGETHER ON OTHER. ON SUPPORTING OTHER INDUSTRIES BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE THAT IT'S ONLY COLLECTIVELY THAT WILL BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THIS. AND DEFINITELY- WILL LEAN TO WORK WITH THAT TH DEVELOPERS SOME OF THEM HAVE ALREADY REACHED OUT- THERE DEFINITELY- CONCERNED ABOUT HAVING A LOCAL PREPARED WORK FORCE. AND AS I PREVIOUSLY STATED- I'M HERE AT YOUR SERVICE AND LOOKINGFOR TO DO WHATEVER WE CAN TO GATHER. TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE SOCIAL AND. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT THAT THIS COMMUNITY. THANK YOU CAN THANK. IF I MAY ADD- TO THAT RESPONSE- TO THAT QUESTION BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER RAMOS- JUST WANTING TO POINT OUT THAT FOR THE COMMISSION THAT HAS BEEN EQUALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE FROM THE DAY ONE THAT WE MET WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE MOST PEOPLE ARE ONLY FAMILIAR WITH. THE TYPE OF MEDIUM RECOVERY THAT HAPPENS IN CHILE AND OTHER PLACES THAT IS NOT AS ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY SO ONE OF OUR PRIORITIES IS TO FROM THE GET GO START TALKING ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGY HOW THIS IS DIFFERENT- JOHN IT THEN WHY SCHOOL TALKED ABOUT HOW HIS COMPANY IS ALREADY TO HAVING THIS WORKSHOPS. BUT ASK THE COMMISSION WE ARE ALSO PLANNING TO- HAVE A WORKSHOP OUR FIRST ONE WILL BE IN SEPTEMBER AND THEN HAVING CONTINUING ENGAGEMENT PROCESS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE COMMUNITY IS THREE C.

SO MADAM EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF COOLEY DESTINY COLIN RYAN. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- COMMITTEE BECAUSE AN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ORGANIZATION WITH OVER THIRTY FIVE YEARS OPERATING IN THE SOLVENCY REGION. I ALSO SERVE AS A- COMMISSION ON TAKING COMMISSION MEMBER AND WE REPRESENTING THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY STREET- COUNTY IS ONE OF THE PREMIER CENTERS FOR DEVELOPMENT OF RENEWABLE ENERGY. AND THE VALLEY IS HOME TO TWO MAJOR PORTS. HI THE SUPPORT AND THE WESTPORT- WHICH ARE YOU KNOW SERVING NEARLY ALL THE INTERNATIONAL TRUCK TRAFFIC CROSSING THE BUTTE COUNTY WITH THE TOTAL TRADE VALUE OVER TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS ACCORDING TO CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT TRANSPORTATION IT ALSO EXPERIENCES- BORDER CROSSING SO ABOUT TWENTY MILLION VEHICLES CROSSING THEM IN BOTH DIRECTIONS BECAUSE OF BOTH THE COMBINED. BOTH NORTH AND SOUTH WITH IDOLING TIMES A ONE TO SIX HOURSADDING CONSIDERABLE GREENHOUSE GASES TO CALIFORNIA'S INVENTORY OF WHICH CALIFORNIA AND HE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAVE PERSISTENTLY IGNORED ANY CARE ABOUT THE ALSO RANKS AMONG THE MOST DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES- WITH AN AVERAGE OF 20% UNEMPLOYMENT RATE AND THESE CONDITIONS IMPACT THE ENTIRE SALTON SEA REGION FROM IMPAIR THE COACHELLA VALLEY. I DO WANNA PLUG THE EFFORTS OF JAIL BOTH THE GOVERNMENT CALIFORNIANS AND UNITED BY AN ADMINISTRATION GOVERNOR AND PRESIDENT BIDEN- FOR THEIR IN- COMMITMENT TO OFFSHORE WIND DEVELOPMENT. BUT THAT SHOULD MIND THAT. WE DON'T HAVE. THIS ADVANCE COMMUNITIES THAT LIVE IN THE COURSE AREA YOU KNOW MOST OF THESE COMMUNITIES DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES- LIVE IN ECONOMICALLY DEPRESSED AREAS AGRICULTURAL AREAS- LARGEST CITIES INNER CITIES. SO RELY ON A SINGLE STRATEGY AND EXPLOITATION FOR NATURAL RESOURCES OF OUR REGION COULD POTENTIALLY EXACERBATE PRE EXISTING CONDITIONS CAN THE DISADVANTAGED AREAS OF THE SONG C. SO. THEY NEED TO BE A COHERENT CHANGE THROUGHOUT THE REGION WE ARE SHIFTING. THE RESOURCE THE SOURCE OF ENERGY THEY INDUSTRY OPERATES. WE ARE THE STATE OF BEING GIVEN A BLACK CAMPUS BLANK CANVAS THAT OPENS UP A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR COLLABORATION TO SET NEW STANDARDS. OF HOW THE EMERGING LET HIM INDUSTRY OPERATES ACROSS THE NATION PERHAPS THE WORLD'S. AND COMMUNITIES PERSPECTIVE ENVISIONED HAVE TO BE CONSIDERED. INTO A SHE REAL CARBON REDUCTION GOALS AND EQUITABLE USE OF NATURAL RESOURCES. OUR REGION IS RICH IN NATURAL RESOURCE AND IT HAS A STRONG WORKFORCE IN ITS REGION ITS CULTURE YET THE COMMUNITY RESPONSE HE HAS NOT BEEN A TRUE BENEFICIARY OF EXPLOITED RESOURCES. THEY HAVE BEEN FACED WITH ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION OF THE REGION DEALING WITH HEALTH ISSUES SEEING AN ENVIRONMENTAL- DEGRADATION AND IN AN EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS INCREASE EXPONENTIALLY AS WE CONTINUE TO ADD ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF POLLUTION THAT CONTINUE TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE EXISTING POOR AIR QUALITY. WE EXPERIENCED A FRENZY A WIN BY- FEEL SOLAR ENERGY IN FACT WE WENT BACKWARDS IN A WAY AGRICULTURAL LAND THAT HAS PROVIDED JOBS LOCALLY FOR FARMWORKERS AND OTHERS IN THE INDUSTRY FOR OVER A HUNDRED YEARS. INTRADE FOR SOLAR INSTALLATIONS THAT PRODUCE ALMOST SEE LOCAL JOBS AND DEFINITELY NO LONG TERM JOBS- THE DEVELOPMENT AND CREATION OF NEW INDUSTRY MATHIS HAVE TO CONSIDER ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE IMMEDIATE COMMUNITY THE ECONOMIC DRIVER THAT IS MOVING THE USE OF LITHIUM BONTA SAUCY SHOULD ALSO DRIVE THE ECONOMIC GROWTH OF DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IN THE REGION. INCENTIVIZING THE CREATION OF LOCAL WORKFORCE INFRASTRUCTURE AND CAPACITY. I'M A FIRM BELIEVER THAT BERMAN- JUST TO STAKEHOLDERS POLICY MAKERS AND LET HIM PRODUCES CAN WORK HAND IN HAND I BELIEVE CIRCUMVENT IN THE ECOSYSTEM AND THE PUBLIC'S WELLBEING CAN RESULT IN GOOD INTENTIONS YIELDING BAD OUTCOMES. AS A MEMBER OF THE TEAM COMMISSION MYSELF REPRESENTING THIS ADVANCE COMMUNITIES I WILL BE IT IT WILL BE MY DUTY TO WORK COLLABORATIVELY AND TO DO SO DILIGENTLY AND WHAT DO SO BY SHOWING THE COMMUNITY VOICES ALWAYS FRONT AND CENTER. THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA AND THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE THANK YOU. THANK. YOU OUR MODERATOR ANY OTHER CALLS. YES WE HAVE TO IN Q. HELLO ONE SIXTY ONE- LINE IS A- GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TAKING MY MANY IS JAMES RODRIGUEZ AYE A LIVING CATELLA. AND THE REASON THAT I DECIDED TO GIVE A PUBLIC COMMENT IS TO GIVE A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A- GENERAL- AVERAGE CITIZENS PERSPECTIVE AND TAKE ON HOW THIS CAN ACTUALLY BENEFIT OUR LOCAL AREA- MANY OF THE OTHER CALLERS HAVE. MADE A VERY VALID POINTS ON THE FACTS THAT THE AREA NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO BENEFIT FINANCIALLY- ECONOMICALLY- AND- NOT ONLY JUST WITH- AREAS THAT ARE GOING TO BE BRINGING IN MORE. JOBS AND MORE SOCIAL EQUITY BY THE ACCESS TO THE ACTUAL A PRODUCT SO THE BIGGEST THING THAT LITHIUM CAN BE USED FOR IS STORAGE- ENERGY STORAGE WHICH IS FOR BATTERIES. SO I WOULD- SUSPECTING HOPE THAT ONE OF THE MAIN GOALS WOULD BE TO PROVIDE- AND SHE LOOKED AND- STORAGE. AS WELL- SO IF THESE PROVIDERS ARE GONNA BE COMING IN AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE USING OUR AREA AND OUR SOCIAL- MEMBERS TO TRY TO CREATE A BUSINESS AND TO. BETTER THE SALTON SEA WHICH IS A GREAT GOAL- BECAUSE THAT HAS BEEN CONTRIBUTING. A THEN- IT SHOULD ALSO BENEFIT THE LOCAL AREAS BECAUSE ONE OF THE MAJOR THINGS THAT WERE ALSO SEEN THAT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS AND LOCAL SENATORS HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET. A PASS TO THE- OUTAGES OF WATER OR IF FOR ELECTRICITY SO- IT SHOULD EXTEND FURTHER THAN JUST WANTING TO BRING THESE COMMUNITY MEMBERS IN TO WORK ON THE PROJECT. BUT TO BOLSTER THE ENVIRONMENT THAT THEY'RE LIVING IN AND TO MAKE IT MORE SELF SUSTAINING SO THAT THAT GEO THERMAL ENERGY THE WATER THAT'S BEING DESALINATED AND BE CLICKING ON THAT THE ACTUALLY BEING EXTRACTED CAN BE PUT TO USE IN THIS AREA NOT JUST EXPORTED OUT OF THE AREA- THAT'S THE ONLY THING. THAT I CAN THINK OF BY LISTENING TO ALL OF THESE CONVERSATIONS AND- TYPES OF- OF THE TAKES THAT- A REGULAR AVERAGE PERSON MIGHT NOT LISTEN TO THE- A LONG. DETAILED EXPLANATION AND THAT'S KIND OF THE- GENERAL IDEA THAT I TOOK FROM WHAT IS GOING TO BE HAPPENING BRING IN A NEW INDUSTRY THAT WILL HOPEFULLY. HELP TO GENERATE THE CLEANING UP OF THE SALTON SEA WHICH IS. ALREADY NEEDED- AND TO SPEARHEAD GEO THIRD ENERGY AS WELL IN THE AREA WHICH I'VE ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT FOR PROBABLY THE LAST DECADE- BECAUSE- A LOCAL COMPANIES HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET GEOTHERMAL ENERGY ACTIVE IN THE HALL AREAS SO- I THINK THAT THIS IS A GREAT. WAY TO INTRODUCE THE PUBLIC TO IT- BUT IT NEEDS TO BE MORE ON LAYMAN'S TERMS- BECAUSE THE BIG INDICATORS WERE THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS AND I UNDERSTAND THERE'S NEW TECHNOLOGY THAT'S GOING TO BE IMPLEMENTED. BUT WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND IT IN A LAYMAN'S TERMS PERSPECTIVE- THIS IS HOW IT CAN BENEFIT US THIS IS WHAT THESE COMPANIES HAVE. PROMISED TO. WE WILL BRING TO THE AIR TO BE. THE A- THIS IS HOW MUCH IS ACTUALLY GOING TO BENEFITS THE AIR NOT JUST JOBS BECAUSE AS WE ALL KNOW WITH PAST. MANY COMPANIES WILL. TO GET RID OF PAYING JOBS TO KEEP THE HIGH PAYING- CORPORATES OR- MORE PROPER COMING IN SO CHOI IS ONE SMALL FACTOR OF THIS IT NEEDS TO ACTUALLY ENRICH THE COMMUNITY. SO THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS- NEXT WEEK- ONE SIXTY SIX YOUR LINE IS NOW OPEN.

P. S. GOALS IN THE CZECH. REDUCING THE PRICE AND YIELD THERMAL ENERGY WHICH IS A FORM AND- RESOURCE SECTORS IMPORTANT AS WE MOVE FORWARD- ALSO WITH THE- ADVENT OF G. H.
