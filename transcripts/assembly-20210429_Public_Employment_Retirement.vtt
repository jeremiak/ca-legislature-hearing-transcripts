THE FOLKS ARE TALKING YOU'RE

LISTENING I PERSONALLY THINK

00:45:18.549 --> 00:45:21.185
THIS BILL IS ABOUT. THE FACT

00:45:21.251 --> 00:45:22.920
THAT YOU CAN TAKE THE OFFICER

00:45:22.986 --> 00:45:25.322
OUT OF THE PRISON. AND THE

00:45:25.389 --> 00:45:26.857
QUESTION IS CAN YOU TAKE THE

00:45:26.924 --> 00:45:29.560
PRESIDEN OF THE OFFICER. THEY

00:45:29.626 --> 00:45:31.895
NEED TO GO HOME THEY NEED TO BE

00:45:31.962 --> 00:45:33.130
HUSBANDS THEY NEED TO BE.

00:45:33.197 --> 00:45:37.868
THAT'S ARE THEY HAVE FRIENDS

00:45:37.935 --> 00:45:40.704
THAT THEY ASSOCIATE WITH. THEY

00:45:40.771 --> 00:45:43.073
ARE MODELS OF A CAREER WHICH IS

00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:44.675
VERY IMPORTANT N CALIFORNIA

00:45:44.741 --> 00:45:46.643
AND SAW HOW THEY THEIR ABILITY

00:45:46.710 --> 00:45:48.145
CANNOT LEAVE THE PRISON AND

00:45:48.212 --> 00:45:50.247
LEAVE THE PRESENT BEHIND AS

00:45:50.314 --> 00:45:52.082
THEY HEAD HOME IS ACTUALLY VERY

00:45:52.149 --> 00:45:53.350
IMPORTANT TO OUR ABILITY TO

00:45:53.417 --> 00:45:55.786
SUSTAIN OUR PRISONS AND RECRUIT

00:45:55.853 --> 00:45:59.289
THE TRACK PEOPLE. SO I JUST

00:45:59.356 --> 00:46:01.091
THINK THIS IS A IT MAY BE A

00:46:01.158 --> 00:46:02.493
DIFFICULT TOPIC BUT ACTUALLY I

00:46:02.559 --> 00:46:04.061
THINK IT'S ONE THAT. WE OUGHT

00:46:04.128 --> 00:46:05.195
TO BE BACKING THEM UP IN THIS

00:46:05.262 --> 00:46:06.563
CONVERSATION I THINK THAT'S

00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:08.765
WHAT THIS BILL DOES. I THINK

00:46:08.832 --> 00:46:11.835
THE WORK THEY PERFORM IS VERY

00:46:11.902 --> 00:46:14.538
DIFFICULT. ARM AND HONESTLY I

00:46:14.605 --> 00:46:16.874
THINK FRAME THE WAY I DESCRIBE

00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:19.176
IT. CAN YOU. WHEN YOU TAKE THE

00:46:19.243 --> 00:46:20.344
PRESENTS THE CORRECTIONAL

00:46:20.410 --> 00:46:21.979
OFFICER OUT OF THE PRISON CAN

00:46:22.045 --> 00:46:23.113
YOU TAKE THE PRESIDING OFFICER

00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:25.215
WHEN THEY GO HOME. I THINK MOST

00:46:25.282 --> 00:46:26.383
CALIFORNIA'S ACTUALLY BELIEVE

00:46:26.450 --> 00:46:28.452
THAT'S A HUGE ISSUE. AND NOT.

00:46:28.519 --> 00:46:30.420
FOR THEIR FAILINGS. BUT JUST

00:46:30.487 --> 00:46:31.455
LIKE THEY'RE DOING IS VERY

00:46:31.522 --> 00:46:32.623
IMPORTANT PUBLIC WORK AND THE

00:46:32.689 --> 00:46:34.091
STRESSES AND STRAINS OF WHAT

00:46:34.158 --> 00:46:36.193
THEY DEAL WITH ON THE JOB.

00:46:36.260 --> 00:46:37.694
COULD EASILY FOLLOW THEM HOME.

00:46:37.761 --> 00:46:39.930
AND COMPLICATE THEIR PERSONAL

00:46:39.997 --> 00:46:41.131
LIVES AND- YOU KNOW BECAUSE

00:46:41.198 --> 00:46:43.901
