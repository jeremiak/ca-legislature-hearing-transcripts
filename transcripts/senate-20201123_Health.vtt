WEDID HEAR FROM MY TEAMMATES

00:49:45.182 --> 00:49:46.283
ABOUT HOW THEY DO A WARM HAND

00:49:46.350 --> 00:49:48.919
OFF. DUE TO HELP PEOPLE IN A

00:49:48.985 --> 00:49:50.754
SHORT POSITION IF HE HAS IF

00:49:50.821 --> 00:49:52.022
YOU'RE A SELF REGULATED PLAN

00:49:52.089 --> 00:49:53.657
ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE. A SELF

00:49:53.724 --> 00:49:54.658
REGULATE PLAN SINCE WE DON'T

00:49:54.725 --> 00:49:56.059
HAVE THE STATE AUTHORITY OVER

00:49:56.126 --> 00:49:57.794
THOSE PLANS. FOR SOME OF THE

00:49:57.861 --> 00:50:01.531
THINGS THAT- OUR STATE SHOULD

00:50:01.598 --> 00:50:03.633
CONSIDER DOING THAT REGARD.

00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:05.435
RIGHT IT'S CHALLENGING BECAUSE-

00:50:05.502 --> 00:50:07.537
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IT IS

00:50:07.604 --> 00:50:09.206
PREEMPTED UNDER FEDERAL LAW

00:50:09.272 --> 00:50:11.375
FROM IMPOSING REQUIREMENTS ARE

00:50:11.441 --> 00:50:13.577
COVERAGE MANDATES ON SELF

00:50:13.643 --> 00:50:16.279
FUNDED PLANS- UNDER THE FEDERAL

00:50:16.346 --> 00:50:19.182
LAW. ARISSA I DON'T KNOW WHAT

00:50:19.249 --> 00:50:21.585
TYPE OF COVERAGE- MISTER SHARPS

00:50:21.651 --> 00:50:24.454
HIS- AND IF IT IS A SELF FUNDED

00:50:24.521 --> 00:50:25.889
PLAN IT WOULD BE GOVERNED UNDER

00:50:25.956 --> 00:50:29.459
FEDERAL LAW AND NOT STATE LAW-

00:50:29.526 --> 00:50:31.228
IT. IRONICALLY ONE OF THE

00:50:31.294 --> 00:50:33.730
THINGS THAT MAY HAVE. AFFECTED

00:50:33.797 --> 00:50:35.365
HIS BILL IS THE FACT THAT HE

00:50:35.432 --> 00:50:37.300
ASKED FOR THAT COULD BE TESTED

00:50:37.367 --> 00:50:39.169
BE REMOVED FROM THE BILL. I'M

00:50:39.236 --> 00:50:40.871
BECAUSE UNDER FEDERAL LAW THE

00:50:40.937 --> 00:50:42.906
COVERAGE REQUIREMENT ONLY KICKS

00:50:42.973 --> 00:50:44.608
IN IF THE TEST IS ORDERED OR

00:50:44.674 --> 00:50:45.976

00:50:53.817 --> 00:50:54.651
THEN THE COVERAGE REQUIREMENT

00:50:54.718 --> 00:50:59.423
WOULD NOT. AGAIN- UNDER THE

00:50:59.489 --> 00:51:02.192
FEDERAL LAW. THANK YOU CELLS

00:51:02.259 --> 00:51:04.628

THERE HOPEFULLY THEY CAN KEEP

00:51:08.832 --> 00:51:09.733
THEIR REGULATIONS AS WE CAN'T

00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:12.202

01:20:53.915 --> 01:20:55.317
FEW CONCERNS OUTLINED BELOW.

01:20:55.383 --> 01:20:56.918

THIS CONCLUSION THAT ANTIBODY

01:21:15.136 --> 01:21:17.272
TESTING IS NOT DIAGNOSTIC IN

01:21:17.339 --> 01:21:19.708
PART BECAUSE THE FDA AND CDC

WHETHER THIS IS AN ELIGIBLE

01:35:48.676 --> 01:35:50.945
PATIENT IT IS SOMEBODY THAT

01:35:51.011 --> 01:35:52.646
SHOULD GO THROUGH THIS ROUTE

01:35:52.713 --> 01:35:53.681

WE COULD END UP HAVING TWO OR

01:57:37.049 --> 01:57:40.820
THREE- VACCINES OUT THERE IT'S

01:57:40.887 --> 01:57:43.089
POSSIBLE THAT ONE VACCINE MAY

01:57:43.156 --> 01:57:44.323
BE MORE AVAILABLE IN ONE AREA

01:57:44.390 --> 01:57:46.325

DISTRIBUTION. FRANKLY I THINK

01:57:49.896 --> 01:57:51.130
IN THE BEGINNING IT'S GONNA BE

01:57:51.197 --> 01:57:52.064
AN ISSUE OF HAVING ENOUGH

PLANS IN TERMS OF THE COVERAGE

01:58:11.117 --> 01:58:13.853
OF- THE- VACCINE. THE POTENTIAL.

01:58:13.920 --> 01:58:14.854
AGAIN NONE OF HAVE BEEN

01:58:14.921 --> 01:58:17.457
APPROVED YET BY STA BUT AT THAT

01:58:17.523 --> 01:58:19.192
AT THE POINT WHICH THIS HAPPENS.

01:58:19.258 --> 01:58:20.793
ASSEMBLY WILL BEGIN WITH THEIR

01:58:33.539 --> 01:58:34.974
WHAT WE WOULD REQUIRE OF THE

01:58:35.041 --> 01:58:36.843
PLANT BUT WE EXPECT THE PLANS

01:58:36.909 --> 01:58:39.512
TO DO- IF THERE HOPEFULLY ARE

01:58:39.579 --> 01:58:43.749
MULTIPLE. VACCINES AVAILABLE

01:58:43.816 --> 01:58:44.317
HOW WE WOULD EXPECT THEM TO

01:58:44.383 --> 01:58:47.019
COVER THOSE. OKAY AND SO MANY

01:58:47.086 --> 01:58:48.688
MORE SPECIFICALLY AND WAS

01:58:48.754 --> 01:58:49.889
MENTIONED AND IT'S POSSIBLE

01:58:49.956 --> 01:58:50.790
THAT WE CAN HAVE DIFFERENT

VACCINES AT DIFFERENT PRICE

01:58:51.924 --> 01:58:53.459

FORTH BUT THAT IS FOR EXAMPLE

01:59:05.938 --> 01:59:09.075
IS- THOUGHT THAT- THAT- THAT

01:59:09.141 --> 01:59:10.843

THIS NEWS IS ENCOURAGING THERE

02:12:11.523 --> 02:12:12.591

02:12:35.414 --> 02:12:37.783
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL.

02:12:37.849 --> 02:12:39.084
THERE'S NO QUESTION. THAT

02:12:39.151 --> 02:12:40.686

KOBE BAXEEN FREE OF PATIENT

02:12:43.455 --> 02:12:44.923
COST SHARING. TO ENSURE THERE

02:12:44.990 --> 02:12:46.658
ARE NO SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS TO

02:12:46.725 --> 02:12:48.560
VACCINATION. THIS IS ESPECIALLY

02:12:48.627 --> 02:12:49.961
TRUE WITHIN LOW INCOME AND

SUGGESTION OF A CO PAY FOR COST

02:12:55.033 --> 02:12:57.169
SHARING. WOULD BE A TREMENDOUS

02:12:57.235 --> 02:13:00.672
BARRIERS TO EQUITABLE AND

02:13:00.739 --> 02:13:01.273
ETHICAL DISTRIBUTION. FEDERAL

02:13:01.340 --> 02:13:02.641
GUIDE TO DATE IS ALSO ALIGNED

02:13:02.708 --> 02:13:03.909
WITH THIS PRINCIPLE SO WE'RE

02:13:03.975 --> 02:13:05.477

VACCINE REGARDLESS OF THE

02:13:15.053 --> 02:13:16.688
RECIPIENT'S ABILITY TO PAY. AND

02:26:51.469 --> 02:26:52.970
THE TRANSFERRED US TO CATER FOR

02:26:53.037 --> 02:26:56.474
THE FIZER COVED NINETEEN

02:26:56.541 --> 02:26:58.176
VACCINE TRIAL ALSO. MAYBE FROM

02:26:58.242 --> 02:27:00.545
YOUR EXPERIENCE DOING THE TRIAL

02:27:00.611 --> 02:27:03.681
A THEIR THINGS THAT PROVIDERS

02:27:03.748 --> 02:27:05.416
NEED TO KNOW AND THEN OF

02:27:05.483 --> 02:27:07.885
COURSE- THEIR MEDICAL GROUPS

02:27:07.952 --> 02:27:10.821
ARE HEALTH PLANS. IN TERMS OF.

02:27:10.888 --> 02:27:12.790
IT DELUDE STORING ADMINISTERING

02:27:12.857 --> 02:27:13.791
THE VACCINE OTHER TYPES OF

02:27:13.858 --> 02:27:15.893
THINGS THAT- WANTS THAT PEOPLE

02:27:15.960 --> 02:27:16.961
SHOULD BE AWARE OF AS WE

02:27:17.028 --> 02:27:19.363
DEVELOP POLICY FOR COVERAGE AND

02:27:19.430 --> 02:27:22.233
ALSO FOR- PROVIDERS IN TERMS OF

02:27:22.300 --> 02:27:24.268
TO SET EXPECTATIONS ABOUT WHAT

02:27:24.335 --> 02:27:25.002
THEY WOULD NEED TO DO TO

02:27:25.069 --> 02:27:27.271
EFFECTIVELY- YOU'LL RECEIVE AND

02:27:27.338 --> 02:27:29.307
THEN DISTRIBUTE THE VACCINE-

02:27:29.373 --> 02:27:30.942
AND I RECOGNIZE THAT. PLACES

02:27:31.008 --> 02:27:32.743
REQUIRES ALL TO COLD STORAGE SO

02:27:32.810 --> 02:27:33.878
MAYBE INDIVIDUAL PROVIDERS

02:27:33.945 --> 02:27:35.112
WON'T BE DOING IT BUT MAYBE YOU

02:27:35.179 --> 02:27:36.948
CAN SPEAK A LITTLE BIT TOO WHAT

02:27:37.014 --> 02:27:37.682
FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE SOMEONE

02:27:37.748 --> 02:27:39.317
ACTUALLY HAD TO ORGANIZE THIS

02:27:39.383 --> 02:27:40.851
ON THE GROUND WHERE SOME OF THE

02:27:40.918 --> 02:27:41.586
THINGS THAT NEED TO BE

02:27:41.652 --> 02:27:43.521
CONSIDERED WHEN IT COMES TO-

02:27:43.588 --> 02:27:45.923
ACTUALLY ADMINISTERING THIS

02:27:45.990 --> 02:27:47.458
VACCINE ON THE FIELD. THANK YOU

02:27:47.525 --> 02:27:48.526
SENATOR. THIS IS GONNA BE A

02:27:48.593 --> 02:27:50.795
HUGE ISSUE. I THINK THAT THE

02:27:50.861 --> 02:27:53.698
DATA EXCHANGE BETWEEN- THE-

02:27:53.764 --> 02:27:55.800
STATE AND THE PROVIDERS AND THE

02:27:55.866 --> 02:27:57.001
HEALTH INSURANCE IS GOING TO BE

02:27:57.068 --> 02:27:58.569
ONE OF THE KEY AREAS THAT WILL

02:27:58.636 --> 02:28:00.738
EITHER FAIL OR- WERE I MAKE

02:28:00.805 --> 02:28:03.741
THIS WORK- DAY TO. VACCINES

02:28:03.808 --> 02:28:04.909
THAT ARE CLOSEST TO BEING

02:28:04.976 --> 02:28:06.377
APPROVED HAVE. DIFFERENT

02:28:06.444 --> 02:28:08.679
INTERVALS BETWEEN THEM AT LEAST

02:28:08.746 --> 02:28:10.314
IN THEIR STUDIES ONE IS- TWENTY

02:28:10.381 --> 02:28:11.649
ONE DAYS ONE IS TWENTY EIGHT

02:28:11.716 --> 02:28:13.317
DAYS. SO IT WILL WILL NEED TO

02:28:13.384 --> 02:28:15.720
KNOW ABOUT WHAT DRUG THEY HAD

02:28:15.786 --> 02:28:17.421
WHAT TIME THEY HAD IT WHAT LOT

02:28:17.488 --> 02:28:18.990
THEY HAD. IT AND THAT'S GOING

02:28:19.056 --> 02:28:20.691
TO BE VERY DYNAMIC BECAUSE THIS

02:28:20.758 --> 02:28:22.226
IS WE'RE TRYING TO RETURN TO

02:28:22.293 --> 02:28:23.160
MUNITY SO THIS IS GOING TO BE

02:28:23.227 --> 02:28:25.396
GOING ON. ALL OVER THE PLACE.

02:28:25.463 --> 02:28:26.697
SO IT'S GOING TO BE A REAL

02:28:26.764 --> 02:28:27.898
CHALLENGE IS GOING TO BE

02:28:27.965 --> 02:28:29.200
SOMETHING THAT I THINK THE

02:28:29.267 --> 02:28:29.967
PROVIDERS ARE GOING TO BE

02:28:30.034 --> 02:28:32.503
EXCITED ABOUT. BUT I THINK WE

02:28:32.570 --> 02:28:34.405
WILL NEED INFORMATION AND- I'M

02:28:34.472 --> 02:28:38.542
HOPING THAT THE- DATABASE. THAT

02:28:38.609 --> 02:28:39.410
IS PROVIDED. GIVES THAT KIND OF

02:28:39.477 --> 02:28:41.212
HIM. AND MAKES IT AVAILABLE TO

02:28:41.279 --> 02:28:43.147
PROVIDERS I HOPE IT'S NOT A

02:28:43.214 --> 02:28:44.548
CURIOUS TYPE DATABASE THAT

02:28:44.615 --> 02:28:46.217
TAKES YOU KNOW FIVE TEN YEARS.

02:28:46.284 --> 02:28:47.518
GET TO A POINT WHERE WE CAN

02:28:47.585 --> 02:28:50.254
ACTUALLY USE A CLINICALLY. SO

02:28:50.321 --> 02:28:51.555
SOME SORT OF INTERFACE WITH

02:28:51.622 --> 02:28:54.058
EPIC OR CERNER THE MAJOR IBM

02:28:54.125 --> 02:28:56.160
OURS WOULD BE JUST UTSTANDING-

02:28:56.227 --> 02:28:57.862
IN TERMS OF THE PROBLEMS THAT

02:28:57.928 --> 02:29:00.064
WE'VE SEEN- GIVING IT TO

02:29:00.131 --> 02:29:01.465
PROBABLY ABOUT A HUNDRED AND

02:29:01.532 --> 02:29:04.402
THIRTY PATIENTS GOT ACTIVE DRUG

02:29:04.468 --> 02:29:06.570
OUT OF THE TWO THIRTY. NOT MUCH-

02:29:06.637 --> 02:29:08.673
PAIN AT THE SITE OF INJECTION

02:29:08.739 --> 02:29:10.274
MALAISE FOR A DAY TREATED WITH

02:29:10.341 --> 02:29:12.610
NONSTEROIDAL ALL GOT BETTER. SO

02:29:12.677 --> 02:29:13.978
I THINK I THINK THIS IS GOING

02:29:14.045 --> 02:29:15.713
TO BE OUR OUR REAL INFLECTION

02:29:15.780 --> 02:29:17.481
POINT TO. MAKE A CHANGE IN THIS

02:29:17.548 --> 02:29:19.950
DISEASE THANK YOU FOR

02:29:20.017 --> 02:29:22.086
LISTENING. AND MAYBE JUST

02:29:22.153 --> 02:29:26.257
ANOTHER QUESTION- AND- RELATION

02:29:26.324 --> 02:29:31.062
TO THAT- WHAT IT COMES SO. WELL

02:29:31.128 --> 02:29:32.997
FIRST ALL I ATE PERHAPS IT'S

02:29:33.064 --> 02:29:33.931
SELF EVIDENT TO THOSE OF US WHO

02:29:33.998 --> 02:29:35.633
WHO ARE IN MEDICINE BUT MAY NOT

02:29:35.700 --> 02:29:37.501
BE SELF EVIDENT IS THAT WE HAVE

02:29:37.568 --> 02:29:39.003
MULTIPLE VACCINES THEY REQUIRE

02:29:39.070 --> 02:29:40.137
TWO DOSES YOU CAN'T GIVE ONE

02:29:40.204 --> 02:29:41.772
DOES ONE VACCINE AND GIVE THE

02:29:41.839 --> 02:29:42.540
SECOND DOSE OF THE OTHER

02:29:42.606 --> 02:29:45.242
VACCINE CORRECT. IS THAT WOULD

02:29:45.309 --> 02:29:45.876
BE MY UNDERSTANDING IT'S NEVER

02:29:45.943 --> 02:29:48.713
BEEN DONE. OKAY ALL RIGHT. WELL

02:29:48.779 --> 02:29:50.281
SO IS A PEDIATRICIAN SOMETIMES

02:29:50.348 --> 02:29:52.950
YOU'RE LIKE OKAY WE GAVE ONE

02:29:53.017 --> 02:29:53.584
HEAD THAT WE HAVEN'T HAD THAT.

02:29:53.651 --> 02:29:55.653
SO THIS SO IN TERMS OF THE

02:29:55.720 --> 02:29:57.588
DISTRIBUTION OF VACCINE AND

02:29:57.655 --> 02:29:58.222
THEN ALSO THE COVERAGE OF THE

02:29:58.289 --> 02:30:00.257
VACCINE. THEN YOU'D HAVE TO

02:30:00.324 --> 02:30:02.560
ACTUALLY IF YOU GAVE ONE THOSE

02:30:02.626 --> 02:30:04.228
TWO PERSON THEN SOME PLACE YOU

02:30:04.295 --> 02:30:05.196
HAVE TO KNOW THERE'S A SECOND

02:30:05.262 --> 02:30:08.165
AS COMING. OR DEALING WITH. YOU

02:30:08.232 --> 02:30:09.600
DON'T EXACTLY CHANCE THAT YOU

02:30:09.667 --> 02:30:11.435
STILL HAVE A SCOND DOES AT THE

02:30:11.502 --> 02:30:14.305
TIME SECOND DOES IT DO RIGHT.

02:30:14.372 --> 02:30:16.040
AS YOU KNOW FROM YOUR PEDIATRIC

02:30:16.107 --> 02:30:17.742
EXPERIENCE- I WE HAVE A MOBILE

02:30:17.808 --> 02:30:19.877
POPULATION SO AND NOT ONLY WILL

02:30:19.944 --> 02:30:21.579
WE EDUCATE THEM AT THE TIME OF

02:30:21.645 --> 02:30:22.947
THEIR FIRST DOSE WE'RE GOING TO

02:30:23.013 --> 02:30:24.648
HAVE TO TRACK AND- MAKE SURE

02:30:24.715 --> 02:30:26.217
THEY COME FROM THE SECOND DOES.

02:30:26.283 --> 02:30:27.418
BECAUSE WE HAVE NO DATA ON

02:30:27.485 --> 02:30:30.821
WONDER WAS BEING- APPLICATIONS.

02:30:30.888 --> 02:30:31.956
CLOSER IT'S GOING TO BE HERE

02:30:32.022 --> 02:30:34.125
IT'S COULD BE A LOT OF WORK. TO

02:30:34.191 --> 02:30:36.160
MAKE SURE THAT WE GET THOSE

02:30:36.227 --> 02:30:38.062
SECOND DOSES AND WITH THE RIGHT

02:30:38.129 --> 02:30:40.731
DRUG AT THE RIGHT TIME. OKAY

02:30:40.798 --> 02:30:42.900
AND DEPENDING ON THE TIMING OF

02:30:42.967 --> 02:30:46.871
MAYBE THIS IS A QUESTION FOR-

02:30:46.937 --> 02:30:48.572
THE HELP. AMERICA'S HEALTH

02:30:48.639 --> 02:30:51.175
INSURANCE PLANS AND MAYBE EVEN

02:30:51.242 --> 02:30:53.544
FOR TEAMMATES SEE IF- YOU KNOW

02:30:53.611 --> 02:30:54.979
COMING UP IN OPEN ENROLLMENT SO

02:30:55.045 --> 02:30:56.080
IT'S POSSIBLE WE COULD BE

02:30:56.147 --> 02:30:57.681
ADMINISTERING VACCINES WHERE

02:30:57.748 --> 02:31:00.584
SOMEONE GOT WIND OF THIS AND

02:31:00.651 --> 02:31:03.053
THEN THEY CHANGED PLANS. FOR

02:31:03.120 --> 02:31:04.422
AND THEN THE SECOND DOSE IS DO

02:31:04.488 --> 02:31:06.357
SO IS THAT THE SENATE IS THAT

02:31:06.424 --> 02:31:07.391
SOMETHING THAT YOU FOR C. IS

02:31:07.458 --> 02:31:08.993
BEING A PROBLEM OR IS TO

02:31:09.059 --> 02:31:10.261
EXPECTATIONS VERY CLEAR THAT

02:31:10.327 --> 02:31:12.830
WHOEVER INITIATED. IS COVERING

02:31:12.897 --> 02:31:17.902
BOTH DOSES. SURE CHAIRMAN PANIC

02:31:17.968 --> 02:31:19.537
CAN SPEAK TO THAT SO JUST

02:31:19.603 --> 02:31:21.338
WANTED TO CLARIFY TO YOU THAT

02:31:21.405 --> 02:31:22.306
THERE IS GOING TO BE A SEPARATE

02:31:22.373 --> 02:31:24.008
CODE FOR EACH PARTICULAR

02:31:24.074 --> 02:31:25.843
VACCINE EACH PARTICULAR DOES

02:31:25.910 --> 02:31:27.077
WHETHER IT BE THE FIRST OR

02:31:27.144 --> 02:31:28.979
SECOND DOSE. SO IN THE SYSTEM

02:31:29.046 --> 02:31:29.980
WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO KNOW

02:31:30.047 --> 02:31:31.816
WHICH ACTUAL VACCINE THEY GOT

02:31:31.882 --> 02:31:35.252
AND WHETHER IT WAS THE FIRST.

02:31:35.319 --> 02:31:37.488
OR SECOND. BUT IT. GRAYSON DOES.

02:31:37.555 --> 02:31:39.890
PLANS DO. HEALTH INSURER IN

02:31:39.957 --> 02:31:42.226
JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY ONE IT WE

02:31:42.293 --> 02:31:43.160
WOULD NOT HAVE ANY RECORD OF

02:31:43.227 --> 02:31:45.029
WHETHER THAT INDIVIDUAL WAS

02:31:45.095 --> 02:31:46.130
VACCINATED UNDER THEIR PRIOR

02:31:46.197 --> 02:31:48.199
INSURER NOT. AND THIS IS WHY

02:31:48.265 --> 02:31:50.401
IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT- THE

02:31:50.468 --> 02:31:51.902
DATABASES THAT TRICIA BARKER

02:31:51.969 --> 02:31:53.904
SPOKE TO. ARE AVAILABLE SO THAT

02:31:53.971 --> 02:31:54.905
THE STATE AND FEDERAL

02:31:54.972 --> 02:31:56.707
AUTHORITIES CAN'T TRACK. THAT

02:31:56.774 --> 02:31:58.442
INDIVIDUAL THAT SITUATION HELP

02:31:58.509 --> 02:31:59.477
ENSURE THAT THEY DO GET THAT

02:31:59.543 --> 02:32:03.447
CRITICAL SECOND DOSE. OKAY NOW

02:32:03.514 --> 02:32:05.182
WOULD IT BE SIMPLER IF WE

02:32:05.249 --> 02:32:06.650
SIMPLY SAID WHOEVER COVER THE

02:32:06.717 --> 02:32:08.619
FIRST AT NINE WE KOW SINCE WE

02:32:08.686 --> 02:32:09.587
KNOW THIS IS A TWO DOSE VACCINE

02:32:09.653 --> 02:32:11.188
I DON'T WANT OTHER FUTURE

02:32:11.255 --> 02:32:14.758
VACCINES ARE GOING TO COME OUT-

02:32:14.825 --> 02:32:16.660
RELATED. IS THERE SOME THIS IS

02:32:16.727 --> 02:32:18.062

NOW AN INSURED OR WHATEVER

02:32:25.236 --> 02:32:28.105
ELSE- BUT AT THE END REASONABLE

02:32:28.172 --> 02:32:29.073
TO SAY WHAT WOULD YOU START OF

02:32:29.139 --> 02:32:31.242
WITH ONE THAT THAT HEALTH PLAN

02:32:31.308 --> 02:32:33.377
COVERS. THE WHOLE SERIES WHICH

02:32:33.444 --> 02:32:35.713
IS REALLY TO. AS A THAT MAKE

02:32:35.779 --> 02:32:37.815
THINGS EASIER. I JUST WANT TO

02:32:37.882 --> 02:32:39.450
BE CLEAR SO FOR ALL OF THE

02:32:39.517 --> 02:32:40.618
DOSES THAT THE FEDERAL

02:32:40.684 --> 02:32:42.086

REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY'RE

02:32:49.593 --> 02:32:50.694
INSURED OR NOT OR WHICH

02:32:50.761 --> 02:32:52.463
INSURANCE THEY HAVE. OKAY THAT

02:32:52.530 --> 02:32:54.164
INDIVIDUAL IS GOING TO GET THE

02:32:54.231 --> 02:32:55.399
VACCINATION IF THE PERSON IS

02:32:55.466 --> 02:32:56.700
UNINSURED THERE'S GONNA BE A

02:32:56.767 --> 02:32:57.902
FINE THAT THEY CAN SEE THAT

02:32:57.968 --> 02:32:59.503
FUNDING TO GO FOR THAT

02:32:59.570 --> 02:33:02.573
VACCINATION ADMINISTRATION.

OF COURSE GET A CLEAN FOR A

02:33:08.579 --> 02:33:10.614
VACCINE ADMINISTRATION. WE HAVE

02:33:10.681 --> 02:33:12.216
TO COVER IT UNDER THE FEDERAL

02:33:12.283 --> 02:33:15.085
AND- STATE FEDERAL LAW AND THE

02:33:15.152 --> 02:33:16.620
REGULATIONS THAT WERE DESCRIBED

02:33:16.687 --> 02:33:17.788
EARLIER HOPE THAT MAKES SENSE.

02:33:17.855 --> 02:33:19.390
OKAY LIKE FOR THAT PERSON IT'S

02:33:19.456 --> 02:33:23.460
VERY SEAMLESS. THEY'RE GETTING

02:33:23.527 --> 02:33:25.763
THE VACCINATION. NO BALANCE.

02:33:25.829 --> 02:33:28.532
OKAY ALL RIGHT- AND THEN I DID

02:33:28.599 --> 02:33:30.100
HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION FOR YOU.

TO HEALTH PLANS DOING IN

02:33:59.930 --> 02:34:01.765
RELATION TO COVERAGE OF

02:34:01.832 --> 02:34:02.266
DIFFERENT TREATMENTS AND

02:34:02.333 --> 02:34:05.769

02:34:08.739 --> 02:34:10.107
REALLY GREAT QUESTION I WILL

02:34:10.174 --> 02:34:11.442
SAY THAT A NUMBER OF OUR

02:34:11.508 --> 02:34:13.811
MEMBERS HAVE VOLUNTARILY WAIVED

02:34:13.877 --> 02:34:15.145
I CALLED IN NINETEEN TREATMENT

02:34:15.212 --> 02:34:16.680
COST SHARING THROUGH THE PUBLIC

02:34:16.747 --> 02:34:19.049
HEALTH EMERGENCY AND SOME CASES

02:34:19.116 --> 02:34:20.618
EVEN BEYOND THAT- BUT TEARS

02:34:20.684 --> 02:34:22.052
SPECIFIC QUESTION AROUND WHICH

02:34:22.119 --> 02:34:23.253
A SPECIFIC TREATMENTS ARE

02:34:23.320 --> 02:34:25.255
COVERED BY THE PLAN. YOU KNOW

02:34:25.322 --> 02:34:27.625
WE HAVE- ALL OUR PLANS YET

02:34:27.691 --> 02:34:30.394
VERY- CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICERS

02:34:30.461 --> 02:34:32.029
WHO LOOK AT THE DATA AND

02:34:32.096 --> 02:34:33.197
EVIDENCE TO HELP MAKE THOSE

02:34:33.263 --> 02:34:36.266
DECISIONS ON BEHALF OF THEIR-

02:34:36.333 --> 02:34:37.701
INSURANCE PLANS ARE FORTUNATE

02:34:37.768 --> 02:34:39.236
SEMI QUITE AREA OF EXPERTISE

02:34:39.303 --> 02:34:40.804
FOR EXAMPLE WE DO KNOW THAT

02:34:40.871 --> 02:34:42.272
THEY REVIEW THE EVIDENCE AND

02:34:42.339 --> 02:34:43.240
ARE HELPING MAKE THOSE

02:34:43.307 --> 02:34:45.042
DECISIONS AND I THINK. WE'VE

02:34:45.109 --> 02:34:46.543
BEEN CLOSELY MONITORING THE

02:34:46.610 --> 02:34:48.212
STA- TO SOME RECENT

02:34:48.278 --> 02:34:49.913
ANNOUNCEMENTS OF THE LAST DAY

02:34:49.980 --> 02:34:52.149
OR SO HOW THEY MAKE THOSE

02:34:52.216 --> 02:34:53.317
COVERAGE DECISIONS JUST MAKE

02:34:53.384 --> 02:34:54.451
SURE THAT PEOPLE CAN GET ANY

02:34:54.518 --> 02:34:56.720
TREATMENT OKAY SO BUT AND I

02:34:56.787 --> 02:34:59.156

DIRECTION AND GUIDANCE AND

02:35:05.763 --> 02:35:07.731
ABOUT WHAT'S- HOW'S THAT

02:35:07.798 --> 02:35:08.632
COMMUNICATED DENTED THE

02:35:08.699 --> 02:35:10.401
PROVIDER COMMUNITY BECAUSE THIS

02:35:10.467 --> 02:35:12.236
IS A AGAIN THIS IS FAST MOVING

02:35:12.302 --> 02:35:14.538
RIGHT SO- DATESAND THINGS ARE

02:35:14.605 --> 02:35:16.540
CHANGING RAPIDLY AND AT THE

02:35:16.607 --> 02:35:18.308
SAME TIME YOU'RE- A DOCTOR YOU

02:35:18.375 --> 02:35:20.010
SEEN THE PATIENT AND- YOU

02:35:20.077 --> 02:35:26.350
CHOOSE. A PARTICULAR TREATMENT

02:35:26.417 --> 02:35:26.950
AND THEN. THE MEDICAL DIRECTOR

02:35:27.017 --> 02:35:27.584
AS WELL WE JUSTICE LAST WEEK

02:35:27.651 --> 02:35:28.185
BASED ON SOMETHING AND AFTER

02:35:28.252 --> 02:35:28.819
THAT WE'RE GOING TO COVER THIS

02:35:28.886 --> 02:35:30.421
ANY. THE THOUGH WE COVER IT.

02:35:30.487 --> 02:35:32.489
TWO WEEKS AGO- SO HOW HOW HOW

02:35:32.556 --> 02:35:33.524
DO YOU SEE THAT BEING

02:35:33.590 --> 02:35:36.026
COMMUNICATED TO. TO PHYSICIANS

02:35:36.093 --> 02:35:37.561
AND OTHER PROVIDERS IN TERMS

02:35:37.628 --> 02:35:40.297
OF- THESE TYPES OF GUIDELINES

02:35:40.364 --> 02:35:42.933
INCISIONS. SO SHERIN DAN FIRST

02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:44.768
AND I HAVEN'T REALLY HEARD ANY

02:35:44.835 --> 02:35:47.705
STORIES OF PEOPLE. GETTING

02:35:47.771 --> 02:35:49.073
NEEDED COVERAGE FOR SOME OF

02:35:49.139 --> 02:35:50.474
THESE NEW THERAPIES COMING ON

02:35:50.541 --> 02:35:52.109
THE MARKET SO IT'S NOT

02:35:52.176 --> 02:35:53.210
SOMETHING THAT HAS COME ACROSS

02:35:53.277 --> 02:35:55.479
MY DESK RECENTLY SO I DON'T.

02:35:55.546 --> 02:35:56.547
KNOW JUST BECAUSE IT'S NOT A

02:35:56.613 --> 02:35:58.048
WIDESPREAD PROBLEM OR WHAT HAVE

YOU SO I REALLY HAVEN'T HEARD.

02:35:59.516 --> 02:36:00.684
OF THAT DAY NOT A PROBLEM IN

SOME OF THESE NEW TREATMENTS

02:36:02.319 --> 02:36:03.854
HAVE BEEN COMING. OUT AND SOME

02:36:03.921 --> 02:36:04.555
OF THEM HAVE BEEN IN QUITE

02:36:04.621 --> 02:36:06.457
SHORT SUPPLY- IT'S BEEN A

02:36:06.523 --> 02:36:08.292
BIGGER ISSUE AS WELL I WILL SAY

02:36:08.358 --> 02:36:09.693
THAT IN GENERAL HEALTH

02:36:09.760 --> 02:36:11.462
INSURANCE PLANS REALLY WORK

02:36:11.528 --> 02:36:13.530
HARD TO KEEP THEIR COVERAGE

02:36:13.597 --> 02:36:15.933
POLICIES UP TO DATE. ON THEIR

02:36:15.999 --> 02:36:16.800
RECENT PROVIDES SEVERAL

02:36:16.867 --> 02:36:19.269
RESOURCES FOR THEIR- PROVIDE

02:36:19.336 --> 02:36:20.704
THEIR PROVIDERS AND WHICH SORT

02:36:20.771 --> 02:36:22.706
OF WHAT'S WHAT'S COVERED. UNDER

02:36:22.773 --> 02:36:26.977
THAT JONES. THE MEDICAL

02:36:27.044 --> 02:36:27.845
COVERAGE POLICIES. OKAY AND- I

02:36:27.911 --> 02:36:29.446
AT A THE BARS. DID YOU WANT

02:36:29.513 --> 02:36:32.883
MAKE A COMMENT ON ON THAT AS A-

02:36:32.950 --> 02:36:34.852
THE HEAD OF A- NINE YEAR OLD

02:36:34.918 --> 02:36:36.220
CMA AND ALSO AS A PHYSICIAN

02:36:36.286 --> 02:36:38.255
WHO. IS OVERSEAS A LARGE HEALTH

02:36:38.322 --> 02:36:41.925
SYSTEM. WELL I YOU KNOW I THINK

02:36:41.992 --> 02:36:45.329
THE WHOLE KEY HERE IS YOU KNOW

02:36:45.395 --> 02:36:47.965
WE CANNOT ANTICIPATE. EXACTLY

02:36:48.031 --> 02:36:49.566
WHAT'S GONNA GO ON AND THIS

02:36:49.633 --> 02:36:50.501
GOES BACK TO MY PREVIOUS

02:36:50.567 --> 02:36:52.102
COMMENT I'M NOT TRYING TO

02:36:52.169 --> 02:36:53.737
LEGISLATE THINGS AS MUCH AS

02:36:53.804 --> 02:36:56.974
CREATE- EVOLVING GUIDELINES

02:36:57.040 --> 02:36:58.909
ABOUT WHAT'S BEST PRACTICES.

02:36:58.976 --> 02:37:01.111
AND IN LISTA CALIFORNIA

02:37:01.178 --> 02:37:03.147
HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION AND THE

02:37:03.213 --> 02:37:05.082
CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION-

02:37:05.149 --> 02:37:06.884
IN THAT EFFORT TO MAKE URE

02:37:06.950 --> 02:37:08.652
THAT EVERYBODY'S DOING EXACTLY

02:37:08.719 --> 02:37:10.020
THE RIGHT THING AND THE RIGHT

02:37:10.087 --> 02:37:11.088
THING MIGHT CHANGE A LITTLE

02:37:11.155 --> 02:37:14.525
BIT- AS NEW- YOU JACKSON'S COME

02:37:14.591 --> 02:37:17.528
OUT AND- AND- YOU TO MAKE THE

02:37:17.594 --> 02:37:18.495
RIGHT DECISION FOR EACH

02:37:18.562 --> 02:37:21.565
SPECIFIC PATIENT- SO I'LL JUST

02:37:21.632 --> 02:37:22.966
LEAVE IT. OUT LEAVE IT THERE.

02:37:23.033 --> 02:37:26.003
OKAY TRAINING IS ALSO G. ONE OF

02:37:26.069 --> 02:37:29.873
MAKING COMMENTS. FOR THE

02:37:29.940 --> 02:37:30.841
HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION ON THAT.

02:37:30.908 --> 02:37:32.609
SO I THINK- DELIVERS THE KIND

02:37:32.676 --> 02:37:34.444
COVERAGE A LOT OF THIS- AND AS

02:37:34.511 --> 02:37:35.012
I SAID IN MY REMARKS IT'S-

02:37:35.078 --> 02:37:36.180
THOSE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT

02:37:36.246 --> 02:37:37.981
WE JUST WANT TO KIND OF MAKE

02:37:38.048 --> 02:37:39.316
SURE THAT OUR PROVIDERS-

02:37:39.383 --> 02:37:40.918
HAPPENS OUT HAVE ACCESS POINTS

02:37:40.984 --> 02:37:42.686
AND ARE ABLE TO TREAT THE

02:37:42.753 --> 02:37:45.255
PATIENT AS AS THEY COME. OKAY

02:37:45.322 --> 02:37:47.324
AND THEN I STANDARDLESS I'LL

02:37:47.391 --> 02:37:47.891
GIVE YOU THE LAST WORD IS

02:37:47.958 --> 02:37:49.693
CONSUMER REPRESENTATIVE ADDED

02:37:49.760 --> 02:37:50.427
THINGS THAT WE SHOULD BE

02:37:50.494 --> 02:37:52.830
CONCERNED ABOUT- THAT STATE.

02:37:52.896 --> 02:37:53.564
FOR IN TERMS OF ACCESS TO

02:37:53.630 --> 02:37:59.336
TREATMENTS. SIDE VACCINES. I

02:37:59.403 --> 02:38:00.470
THINK AS FAR AS ACCESS TO

02:38:00.537 --> 02:38:02.906
TREATMENTS WE NEED TO ENSURE

02:38:02.973 --> 02:38:06.176
THAT THAT FOLKS- KNOW WHAT

02:38:06.243 --> 02:38:08.045
TREATMENTS ARE COVERED AT NO-

02:38:08.111 --> 02:38:09.179
YOU KNOW FOR HOW LONG ONCE A

02:38:09.246 --> 02:38:10.881
PUBLIC HEALTH. EMERGENCY ENDS

02:38:10.948 --> 02:38:12.216
ARE THEY GOING TO BE ABLE TO BE

02:38:12.282 --> 02:38:14.318
COVERED FOR. ANY ON GOING

02:38:14.384 --> 02:38:17.254
ISSUES- AND- REALLY I THINK

02:38:17.321 --> 02:38:18.188
RIGHT NOW THE NUMBER ONE THING

02:38:18.255 --> 02:38:19.356
IS JUST PROVIDING CLARITY WHAT

02:38:19.423 --> 02:38:20.557
WE DON'T WANT TO- PEOPLE

02:38:20.624 --> 02:38:21.959
SITTING AT HOME WORRIED ABOUT.

02:38:22.025 --> 02:38:23.627
BILLS I'M COMING OUR WAY AND

02:38:23.694 --> 02:38:24.695
NOT SEEKING TREATMENT WHEN THEY

02:38:24.761 --> 02:38:27.130
REALLY DO. OKAY THANK YOU AND I

02:38:27.197 --> 02:38:28.732
APPRECIATE THE RECOGNIZING THIS

02:38:28.799 --> 02:38:29.933
YOU KNOW THE FACT THAT THERE

02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:31.568
ARE MANY PEOPLE WHO. WE OFTEN

02:38:31.635 --> 02:38:32.936
TALK ABOUT THE NUMBER OF CASES

02:38:33.003 --> 02:38:34.204
WE EVEN TALK ABOUT THE NUMBER

02:38:34.271 --> 02:38:36.740
OF DEATHS WHICH IS OVER TWO

02:38:36.807 --> 02:38:37.374
HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND WHICH IS

02:38:37.441 --> 02:38:38.909
HORRENDOUS. BUT ALSO THERE'S

02:38:38.976 --> 02:38:40.077
MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE SURVIVED

02:38:40.143 --> 02:38:41.979
COVETED BUT ARE STILL SUFFERING

02:38:42.045 --> 02:38:43.614
FROM CODED THIS IS. I THINK

02:38:43.680 --> 02:38:44.648
SOMETIMES FROM THE LONG

02:38:44.715 --> 02:38:46.350
HAULERS. BUT THAT'S BECOMING AN

02:38:46.416 --> 02:38:48.118
EVER INCREASINGLY LARGE NUMBER

02:38:48.185 --> 02:38:49.586
OF PEOPLE AS WELL AND THEY NEED

02:38:49.653 --> 02:38:51.822
ONGOING TREATMENT- ON AN

02:38:51.889 --> 02:38:54.157
ONGOING BASIS SO- EFFECTIVE FOR

02:38:54.224 --> 02:38:55.125
THEM BECAUSE OF IT IS A PRE

02:38:55.192 --> 02:38:56.560
EXISTING CONDITION THAT THEY

02:38:56.627 --> 02:38:58.562
NEED CONTINUING CARE FOR- SO

02:38:58.629 --> 02:39:00.497
WITH THAT. IN MIND JUST TURN

02:39:00.564 --> 02:39:01.698
