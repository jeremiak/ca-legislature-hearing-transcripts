00:12:56.208 --> 00:12:57.576
HISTORIAN OF PUTTING THIS ON THE

00:12:57.643 --> 00:12:59.979
BALLOT -- OVER THE YEARS

00:13:00.045 --> 00:13:03.682
INCLUDING LAST IN -- NINETY

00:13:03.749 --> 00:13:04.884
THREE THEY WERE ALL UNSUCCESSFUL

00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:06.719
WHAT WHAT WILL BE DIFFERENT THIS

00:13:06.785 --> 00:13:09.021
TIME.

00:13:09.088 --> 00:13:11.257
I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT OUR

00:13:11.323 --> 00:13:12.691
PREVIOUS ELECTIONS THAT HAVE

00:13:12.758 --> 00:13:13.392
HAPPENED MORE RECENTLY THAT

00:13:13.459 --> 00:13:14.527
THERE I THINK THERE'S MUCH MORE

00:13:14.593 --> 00:13:16.228
OPENNESS FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS

00:13:16.295 --> 00:13:18.264
THE ELECTORATE IS CHANGED --

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:18.831
SOME OF THE CONDITIONS HAVE

00:13:18.898 --> 00:13:22.735
CHANGED -- YOU KNOW.

00:13:22.801 --> 00:13:23.636
WE THINK THAT THE ELECTORATE IS

00:13:23.702 --> 00:13:25.104
CHANGING THE WAY THAT WILL BE

00:13:25.171 --> 00:13:27.072
ABLE TO BE SUCCESSFUL THIS TIME.

00:13:27.139 --> 00:13:28.941
AND I THINK THAT'S REFLECTED IN

00:13:29.008 --> 00:13:31.911
THE NUMBER OF ALSO TO SURPRISING

00:13:31.977 --> 00:13:33.746
RESULTS THAT HAPPENED RECENTLY --

00:13:33.812 --> 00:13:35.281
ON ON SAY WHITE BALLOTS THAT

00:13:35.347 --> 00:13:36.749
HAVE BROKEN.

00:13:36.815 --> 00:13:39.718
NORMS IN MALLS FROM THE PAST.

00:13:39.785 --> 00:13:41.187
AT ALL I I I THINK THAT THE

00:13:41.253 --> 00:13:44.123
PUBLIC CONSCIOUSNESS AROUND THE

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:46.625
HOUSING -- DISASTER THAT WE'RE

00:13:46.692 --> 00:13:48.994
IN RIGHT NOW MAYBE IT WASN'T A

00:13:49.061 --> 00:13:50.796
DISASTER IN NINETEEN NINETY

00:13:50.863 --> 00:13:52.665
THREE IT IS NOW -- AND IF YOU

00:13:52.731 --> 00:13:53.999
LOOK AT THE PUBLIC TO THE

00:13:54.066 --> 00:13:57.102
POLLING STATEWIDE -- A FIVE OR

00:13:57.169 --> 00:13:58.837
TEN YEARS AGO HOUSING WAS NOT

00:13:58.904 --> 00:13:59.872
THE TOP OR EVEN ONE OF THE TOP

00:13:59.939 --> 00:14:01.607
ISSUE STATEWIDE WAS IN SOME

00:14:01.674 --> 00:14:02.474
CITIES.

00:14:02.541 --> 00:14:04.009
BUT NOT STATEWIDE IT IS NOW

00:14:04.076 --> 00:14:05.811
CONSISTENTLY HOUSING AND

00:14:05.878 --> 00:14:07.846
HOMELESSNESS -- SO I IN THE

00:14:07.913 --> 00:14:10.916
ELECTORATE IN A VERY DIFFERENT

00:14:10.983 --> 00:14:12.251
PLACE NOW THAN IT WAS IN.

00:14:12.318 --> 00:14:14.053
NINETY THREE SO WE WE HAVE SEEN

00:14:14.119 --> 00:14:16.422
CHANGES -- OBVIOUSLY ONE OF THE

00:14:16.488 --> 00:14:17.923
THE SPEAKERS WAS FROM CALIFORNIA

00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:19.425
EMB.

00:14:19.491 --> 00:14:21.160
SO WE HAVE PUSH BACK THE OTHER

00:14:21.227 --> 00:14:21.727
SIDE BUT I'VE BEEN GETTING

00:14:21.794 --> 00:14:23.495
EMAILS SINCE THE BEGINNING OF

00:14:23.562 --> 00:14:24.063
THE YEAR WONDERING WHAT I'M

00:14:24.129 --> 00:14:24.997
DOING.

00:14:25.064 --> 00:14:27.066
TOUCHING ARTICLE THIRTY FOR THE

00:14:27.132 --> 00:14:28.567
CONSTITUTION I WAS CONFUSED AT

00:14:28.634 --> 00:14:30.035
FIRST WHEN I STARTED GETTING THE

00:14:30.102 --> 00:14:31.704
THE EMAILS BUT THERE ARE STILL A

00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:33.405
LOT OF PEOPLE THAT FEEL LET.

00:14:33.472 --> 00:14:34.006
THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO SELECT

00:14:34.073 --> 00:14:37.476
THEIR NEIGHBORS AND SO THAT'S AN

00:14:37.543 --> 00:14:39.311
INCREDIBLE PSYCHE THAT YOU'RE

00:14:39.378 --> 00:14:41.447
GOING TO DEAL WITH -- AT GOING

00:14:41.513 --> 00:14:43.949
FORWARD SO VOTING FOR THIS --

00:14:44.016 --> 00:14:46.218
BILL IS IS JUST ALARM THE VOTERS --

00:14:46.285 --> 00:14:48.687
TO WAY IN.

00:14:48.754 --> 00:14:49.688
THAT'S ABSOLUTE RIGHT IT'LL JUST

00:14:49.755 --> 00:14:50.689
ALLOWS THE VERGE NGUYEN IN THE

00:14:50.756 --> 00:14:52.625
OTHER THING I'LL MENTION IS.

00:14:52.691 --> 00:14:54.960
THIS DOESN'T IMPACT THE RIGHT OF

00:14:55.027 --> 00:14:56.095
ANY CITY GOVERNMENT.

00:14:56.161 --> 00:14:58.364
DO YOU STILL MAINTAIN THEIR OWN

00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:01.934
ZONING LAND USE PLANNING RULES.

00:15:02.001 --> 00:15:02.835
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE SEEING YOU

00:15:02.901 --> 00:15:04.470
KNOW SUPPORT OF CITIES IN THIS

00:15:04.536 --> 00:15:06.605
IN THIS CONVERSATION -- SO THE

00:15:06.672 --> 00:15:07.539
THE CITY GOVERNMENT THAT IS

00:15:07.606 --> 00:15:09.308
ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE OF THE

00:15:09.375 --> 00:15:10.876
CITY WHO ARE POLITICALLY

00:15:10.943 --> 00:15:12.278
ACCOUNTABLE TO THOSE PEOPLE WILL

00:15:12.344 --> 00:15:14.680
STILL BE ABLE TO MAKE

00:15:14.747 --> 00:15:16.915
DETERMINATIONS -- AND SO IN THAT

00:15:16.982 --> 00:15:17.983
SENSE ARE STILL A GREAT DEAL OF

00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:20.152
ACCOUNTABILITY LOCALLY.

00:15:20.219 --> 00:15:21.820
YES SO I'M JUST SAYING THAT

00:15:21.887 --> 00:15:23.222
MAYBE VOTING FOR THIS TODAY

00:15:23.289 --> 00:15:23.956
DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT

00:15:24.023 --> 00:15:25.391
MAKE YOU MIGHT APPROVE OF THE

00:15:25.457 --> 00:15:26.425
OVERALL.

00:15:26.492 --> 00:15:27.159

GIVING THE VOTERS OPPORTUNE WAY.

00:15:30.963 --> 00:15:32.431
RIGHT TO HAVE ANY OTHER FOR

00:15:32.498 --> 00:15:33.065
DISCUSSION ON THIS ITEM.

00:15:33.132 --> 00:15:34.867

LONG OVERDUE -- AYE AYE YEAH

THAT WE NEED TO TAKE AWAY THIS

00:15:46.245 --> 00:15:47.846
THIS THIS IS A BARRIER THAT IS

00:15:47.913 --> 00:15:49.581
ACTUALLY COSTING TAXPAYERS MONEY --

00:15:49.648 --> 00:15:50.816
AS WE ARE TRYING TO WHERE WE'RE

00:15:50.883 --> 00:15:51.750

CRISIS AND WE ALL HAVE DIFFERENT

00:15:54.353 --> 00:15:55.287

ORANGE COUNTY.

00:20:39.504 --> 00:20:42.040

THE CREATION OF SHELTERS.

00:20:50.515 --> 00:20:52.417
AND AGAIN PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE

00:20:52.484 --> 00:20:55.053
HOUSING -- IT AND ONE OF THE

00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:57.022

TO ASK THEM TO WORK TOWARDS A

00:21:05.764 --> 00:21:08.100

00:21:08.166 --> 00:21:11.570

FIRST DOES THIS IS NOT A MANDATE

00:27:21.039 --> 00:27:22.340
WHICH MEANS THAT.

00:27:22.407 --> 00:27:24.209
THE LOCAL CITIES WITHIN THOSE

00:27:24.275 --> 00:27:25.643
COUNTIES CAN STILL MAKE THE

00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:27.078
DECISION IF THAT'S THE ROUTE

00:27:27.145 --> 00:27:30.849
THEY WANT TO GO IN ORDER.

TO BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN --

00:27:33.318 --> 00:27:35.153

00:27:36.921 --> 00:27:39.457
HE FUNDS AND SO FORTH A CITY

00:27:39.524 --> 00:27:42.093

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:44.329
CRISIS OR EMERGENCY UP TO GET

00:27:44.396 --> 00:27:45.797

PIECE OF LEGISLATION.

00:27:49.401 --> 00:27:50.468
BUT AS FAR AS BUILDING THE

00:27:50.535 --> 00:27:53.738
HOUSING -- WE WOULD MAKE SURE --

00:27:53.805 --> 00:27:55.240
THAT THIS HEALTH AND SAFETY

00:27:55.306 --> 00:27:57.409

00:27:57.475 --> 00:27:58.877
IT'S JUST.

00:27:58.943 --> 00:28:00.812
THAT THERE WOULD BE SOME TYPES

00:28:00.879 --> 00:28:04.082
OF STREAMLINING THAT WOULD ALLOW

00:28:04.149 --> 00:28:06.818
IT TO MOVE FASTER AS WE KNOW

00:28:06.885 --> 00:28:09.154
EVEN A REGULAR -- TYPE OF

00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:11.556
DEVELOPMENT CAN SOMETIMES TAKE

00:28:11.623 --> 00:28:13.458
TWO TO THREE YEARS FROM GOING

00:28:13.525 --> 00:28:15.427
FROM -- NOT ONLY PLANNING

00:28:15.493 --> 00:28:19.064
DEPARTMENT TO DEVELOPMENT AND

00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:20.632
THROUGH ALL THE PROCESSES SO

00:28:20.698 --> 00:28:23.301
THIS WOULD HOPEFULLY BE MUCH

00:28:23.368 --> 00:28:25.737
QUICKER OTHERWISE WE WOULDN'T

00:28:25.804 --> 00:28:28.239
REALLY BE OF OUR OUR GOAL IS TO

00:28:28.306 --> 00:28:31.109
GET THESE PROJECTS DONE WITHIN.

00:28:31.176 --> 00:28:32.110
TWO TO THREE YEARS WELL THE

00:28:32.177 --> 00:28:34.045
FUNDING IS THERE AS FAR AS THE

00:28:34.112 --> 00:28:37.382
SHELTERS EMERGENCY SHELTERS --

00:28:37.449 --> 00:28:39.050
MANY OF THESE PROPERTIES WOULD

00:28:39.117 --> 00:28:42.454
BE BUILT ON CITY PROPERTY AS WE

00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:44.189
KNOW THAT SOME OF THE PROPERTY

00:28:44.255 --> 00:28:46.858
IS ALREADY OWNED BY THE CITY AND

00:28:46.925 --> 00:28:47.792
THEY'RE BUILDING.

00:28:47.859 --> 00:28:54.599
WHAT WOULD BE MORE TEMPORARY UP

00:28:54.666 --> 00:28:55.700
KIND OF LIKE OF?

00:28:55.767 --> 00:28:56.734
THE MODULAR BUILDINGS I'M TRYING

00:28:56.801 --> 00:28:57.235
TO THINK OF THE TYPE OF

00:28:57.302 --> 00:28:57.802
BUILDINGS THEY BRING ON TO

00:28:57.869 --> 00:28:59.537
SCHOOL CAMPUSES WHEN THEY NEED

00:28:59.604 --> 00:29:00.705
ADDITIONAL THAT THE PRE FAB TYPE

00:29:00.772 --> 00:29:01.573
OF BUILDINGS.

00:29:01.639 --> 00:29:03.274
SO THEY ALREADY HAVE SAFETY

00:29:03.341 --> 00:29:04.809
CODES AND SO FORTH.

00:29:04.876 --> 00:29:06.077
AS FAR AS THE PERMANENT

00:29:06.144 --> 00:29:07.412
SUPPORTIVE HOUSING THAT WOULD

00:29:07.479 --> 00:29:08.913
DEFINITELY GO THROUGH THE CODES

00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:11.816
THAT THE CITIES HAVE IN PLACE --

00:29:11.883 --> 00:29:15.053
AND THOSE WOULD BE PERMANENT --

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:17.522
SO I THINK THE THE GOING AROUND

00:29:17.589 --> 00:29:19.491
SEEK WOODS NOT TO GO AROUND IT

00:29:19.557 --> 00:29:20.892
IT'S TO MAKE SURE THE CHECKS AND

00:29:20.959 --> 00:29:22.961
BALANCES ARE STILL THERE BUT TO

00:29:23.027 --> 00:29:26.264
MOVE IT FORWARD IN A MORE TIMELY

00:29:26.331 --> 00:29:26.998
MANNER.

00:29:27.065 --> 00:29:27.632
NOT SURE IF THAT ANSWERED YOUR

00:29:27.699 --> 00:29:30.135
QUESTIONS.

00:29:30.201 --> 00:29:31.469
AND ALSO THEY WOULD HAVE TO BE

00:29:31.536 --> 00:29:33.771
OF THE OF MAKING SURE THAT THERE

00:29:33.838 --> 00:29:35.840
WAS A REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE

00:29:35.907 --> 00:29:38.476
IN OVERSIGHT BY THE HOUSING AND

00:29:38.543 --> 00:29:40.411
COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT SO THERE

00:29:40.478 --> 00:29:42.981
WOULD BE PEOPLE ON WATCH TO MAKE

00:29:43.047 --> 00:29:43.548
SURE.

00:29:43.615 --> 00:29:45.350
NOT JUST THROWING UP IF YOU WANT

00:29:45.416 --> 00:29:47.619
TO SAY SOME TYPE OF UP VERY

00:29:47.685 --> 00:29:49.554
MINIMAL HOUSING WE'RE NOT

00:29:49.621 --> 00:29:51.456
LOOKING AT TENS ANYTHING LIKE

00:29:51.523 --> 00:29:55.460
THAT.

00:29:55.527 --> 00:29:58.563
ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS.

00:29:58.630 --> 00:30:00.732
PLEASE YES SORRY CENTER MORE

00:30:00.798 --> 00:30:02.934
LIKE THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER

00:30:03.001 --> 00:30:04.536
FOR PROVISION ANYTHING WRONG.

00:30:04.602 --> 00:30:06.004
I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE THE TIP

00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:09.207
HUSTLER -- THIS IS ONLY

00:30:09.274 --> 00:30:10.775
APPLICABLE TO TO COUNTY SAN AND

00:30:10.842 --> 00:30:12.443
ONE CITY AND ONE COUNTY AND I'M

00:30:12.510 --> 00:30:15.246
JUST CURIOUS WHY ISN'T THE BILL --

00:30:15.313 --> 00:30:16.614
STATE LEVEL TO IT YEAH.

00:30:16.681 --> 00:30:17.649
THAT THAT'S THAT IS A GOOD

00:30:17.715 --> 00:30:18.483
QUESTION I'M ACTUALLY GONNA LOOK

00:30:18.550 --> 00:30:22.120
AT MY NOTES FOR THAT ONE OF

00:30:22.187 --> 00:30:23.721
BECAUSE I WAS.

00:30:23.788 --> 00:30:25.089
IT'S SO SPECIFIC.

00:30:25.156 --> 00:30:26.958
AND I BELIEVE RIGHT NOW WE WERE

00:30:27.025 --> 00:30:28.826
JUST GONNA START SMALL AND WE

00:30:28.893 --> 00:30:30.862
DID ACTUALLY WHEN THE BILL CAME

00:30:30.929 --> 00:30:33.231
OUT WE WERE ASKED BY THE CITIES

00:30:33.298 --> 00:30:35.033
MENTIONED IF THEY COULD

00:30:35.099 --> 00:30:36.301
PARTICIPATE.

00:30:36.367 --> 00:30:38.570
BUT WE JUST PRETTY MUCH STARTED

00:30:38.636 --> 00:30:40.438
WITH ORANGE COUNTY AS THAT'S THE

00:30:40.505 --> 00:30:42.807
COUNTY I REPRESENT AND THEN --

00:30:42.874 --> 00:30:45.376
SAN JOSE AND ALAMEDA ASKED TO

00:30:45.443 --> 00:30:46.945
JOIN IN.

00:30:47.011 --> 00:30:48.413
AND WE SAID YES.

00:30:48.479 --> 00:30:50.381
AND THEN WHEN THE CITY DECLARES

00:30:50.448 --> 00:30:53.084
A SHELTER CRISIS IS THAT JUST --

00:30:53.151 --> 00:30:55.386
A RESOLUTION OF THE CITY COUNCIL

00:30:55.453 --> 00:30:56.788
OR THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS.

00:30:56.854 --> 00:30:58.690
IT'S A VOTE BY THE INDIVIDUAL

00:30:58.756 --> 00:30:59.390
CITY.

00:30:59.457 --> 00:31:01.726
AND THE COUNTY COULD A DECLARE --

00:31:01.793 --> 00:31:04.295
COUNTY CRISIS BUT I BELIEVE IF

00:31:04.362 --> 00:31:06.264
WE ARE GOING TO HAVE THIS IN BUT

00:31:06.331 --> 00:31:07.865
IT IN A PARTICULAR CITY THE CITY

00:31:07.932 --> 00:31:09.667
WOULD ALSO HAVE TO DECLARE THE

00:31:09.734 --> 00:31:10.768
CRISIS AS WELL.

00:31:10.835 --> 00:31:12.570
AND THE CITY YOU MEAN THAT THE

00:31:12.637 --> 00:31:16.241
CITY COUNCIL YES.

00:31:16.307 --> 00:31:18.309
THANK YOU MISTER JR THANK YOU.

00:31:18.376 --> 00:31:20.912
OKAY I SEE NO OTHER COMMENT.

00:31:20.979 --> 00:31:22.146
UNFORTUNATELY WE DO NOT YET HAVE

00:31:22.213 --> 00:31:22.914
A QUORUM.

00:31:22.981 --> 00:31:25.550
AND AS SOON AS WE DO WE WILL

00:31:25.617 --> 00:31:27.986
ENTERTAIN A MOTION -- SO WITHOUT

00:31:28.052 --> 00:31:29.420
WOULD YOU LIKE TO FLOWS.

00:31:29.487 --> 00:31:31.122
I WILL I JUST AGAIN SOME OF YOU

00:31:31.189 --> 00:31:33.258
HAVE HEARD ME SPEAK A LITTLE BIT

00:31:33.324 --> 00:31:35.994
ABOUT HOMELESSNESS -- IN OTHER

00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:37.495
AREAS AS LIFE MOVE FORWARD

00:31:37.562 --> 00:31:39.464
SEVERAL BILLS UNDER THIS TOPIC

00:31:39.530 --> 00:31:43.368
THIS YEAR BUT UP PERSONALLY.

00:31:43.434 --> 00:31:44.736
LIKE MANY FAMILIES I'VE SEEN A

00:31:44.802 --> 00:31:46.671
FAMILY MEMBER STRUGGLE WITH THIS

00:31:46.738 --> 00:31:49.073
AND IN ORANGE COUNTY JUST IN

00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:51.743
THIS LAST YEAR -- WE HAVE LOST

00:31:51.809 --> 00:31:53.645
OVER THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE WHO

00:31:53.711 --> 00:31:55.046
HAVE DIED ON ORANGE COUNTY SEAT

00:31:55.113 --> 00:31:57.882
STREETS JUST THIS LAST YEAR.

00:31:57.949 --> 00:32:00.118
AND MANY OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO

00:32:00.184 --> 00:32:02.420
HAVE DIED THAT COULD HAVE BEEN

00:32:02.487 --> 00:32:03.288
PREVENTED.

00:32:03.354 --> 00:32:06.024
NOT ONLY HAVE WE SEEN THAT BUT

00:32:06.090 --> 00:32:07.725
WITH THE JUDGE.

00:32:07.792 --> 00:32:11.629
CARTER DAVID CARTER SO INVOLVED

00:32:11.696 --> 00:32:13.431
HE ACTUALLY.

00:32:13.498 --> 00:32:14.432
PULLED THE AUTOPSY.

00:32:14.499 --> 00:32:16.801
RECORDS AND IT WAS SO IMPORTANT

00:32:16.868 --> 00:32:18.536
TO HIM TO FIND OUT WHAT IS

00:32:18.603 --> 00:32:20.705
REALLY GOING ON IN ADDITION TO

00:32:20.772 --> 00:32:22.373
THEM NOT HAVING SHELTER.

00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:23.908
AND MANY OF THEM DIED FROM

00:32:23.975 --> 00:32:25.510
PNEUMONIA.

00:32:25.576 --> 00:32:27.011
THAT TYPE OF JUST GETTING SICK

00:32:27.078 --> 00:32:28.913
AND NOT BEING ABLE TO GET IT

00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:31.749
RECOVER AND IF YOU IMAGINE BEING

00:32:31.816 --> 00:32:32.884
OUT IN THE STREETS IN YOUR SEC.

00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:33.985

00:32:34.052 --> 00:32:36.454
SICKER AND THAT ALSO PASS ON

00:32:36.521 --> 00:32:38.256
THESE OTHER ISSUES AND MY

00:32:38.323 --> 00:32:39.657
BROTHER WAS ONE OF THOSE.

00:32:39.724 --> 00:32:40.625
SO THAT'S WHY BRING THIS BILL

00:32:40.692 --> 00:32:42.994
FORWARD.

00:32:43.061 --> 00:32:43.961
I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE

THIS BILL -- I BELIEVE THAT THIS

00:33:24.669 --> 00:33:26.838
IS A FAIRLY SIMPLE BILL -- I AM

00:33:26.904 --> 00:33:28.806
A BIG SUPPORTER OF EIGHTY USES

00:33:28.873 --> 00:33:31.409
ONE OF OUR IMPORTANT SOLUTIONS.

00:33:31.476 --> 00:33:32.910
TO HELP WITH THE HOUSING CRISIS

00:33:32.977 --> 00:33:35.346
BRINGING PEOPLE IN A SINGLE

00:33:35.413 --> 00:33:36.681
FAMILY NEIGHBORHOODS -- WORKING

00:33:36.748 --> 00:33:38.549
VERY MUCH WITH PARTNERSHIP WITH

00:33:38.616 --> 00:33:40.585
OUR LOCAL RESIDENTS AND ALSO OF

00:33:40.651 --> 00:33:42.153
COURSE EXPANDING LOCAL --

00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:44.021
PROPERTY RIGHTS BY ALLOWING

00:33:44.088 --> 00:33:45.123
RESIDENTS TO BUILDING EIGHTY YOU

00:33:45.189 --> 00:33:47.225
IF THEY SO CHOOSE --

00:33:47.291 --> 00:33:49.894
UNFORTUNATELY IN CALIFORNIA --

00:33:49.961 --> 00:33:50.361
H. O. WAYS HOMEOWNERS

00:33:50.428 --> 00:33:51.896
ASSOCIATIONS FOR SOME REASON

00:33:51.963 --> 00:33:53.564
HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO WHAT WE

00:33:53.631 --> 00:33:54.999
ARE NOT EVEN ALLOWING CHARTER

00:33:55.066 --> 00:33:55.733
CITIES TO DO.

00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:56.801
AND THEY'VE THROUGH THE

00:33:56.868 --> 00:33:58.302
REGULATIONS COME BLOCK THE

00:33:58.369 --> 00:34:00.138
ABILITY OF A HOMEOWNER TO DO AN

00:34:00.204 --> 00:34:01.305
EIGHTY YOU IF THEY WANT -- AND I

00:34:01.372 --> 00:34:02.306
DON'T THINK THAT WAS EVER

00:34:02.373 --> 00:34:04.308
ANTICIPATED WHEN THE LEGISLATION

00:34:04.375 --> 00:34:06.544
WAS PASSED WOULD BE IT AS IT MAY --

00:34:06.611 --> 00:34:09.647
IT'S REALLY A LOOPHOLE -- SO --

00:34:09.714 --> 00:34:12.116
THERE IS OVER FIFTY TWO THOUSAND

00:34:12.183 --> 00:34:13.418
IT'S ALWAYS IN THE STATE THAT

00:34:13.484 --> 00:34:14.452
MAKE UP.

00:34:14.519 --> 00:34:16.220
TO UP TO ABOUT SIX MILLION TOTAL

00:34:16.287 --> 00:34:18.823
HOUSING UNITS SO THIS BILL WOULD

00:34:18.890 --> 00:34:21.526
JUST SAY THAT THE THE THE M. H.

00:34:21.592 --> 00:34:23.261
ALWAYS HAVE TO FOLLOW THE SAME

00:34:23.327 --> 00:34:24.228
STATE LAWS CITIES IN CHARTER

00:34:24.295 --> 00:34:24.462
CITIES.

00:34:24.529 --> 00:34:26.097
AND CAMP PUT ON REASONABLE

00:34:26.164 --> 00:34:27.265
RESTRICTIONS ON EIGHTY USE

00:34:27.331 --> 00:34:28.466
ALTHOUGH WE DO ALLOW THEM STILL

00:34:28.533 --> 00:34:30.668
THE ABILITY TO HAVE AN IMPACT

00:34:30.735 --> 00:34:32.870
WITH DESIGN -- SETBACKS THAT

00:34:32.937 --> 00:34:34.005
SORT OF THING SO THEY CAN DO IT

00:34:34.071 --> 00:34:35.306
IN A WAY THAT CONFORMS TO THEIR

00:34:35.373 --> 00:34:36.507
DESIGN STANDARDS AND THAT THEIR

00:34:36.574 --> 00:34:38.242
COMMUNITIES BUT WE DON'T WANT

00:34:38.309 --> 00:34:39.243
THEM TO BE ABLE TO TRUMP --

00:34:39.310 --> 00:34:40.545
INDIVIDUAL PROPERTY OWNERS

00:34:40.611 --> 00:34:42.280
ABILITY TO PUT AN EIGHTY YOU IN

00:34:42.346 --> 00:34:43.581
FOR THEIR FOR THEIR PARENTS OR

00:34:43.648 --> 00:34:45.716
THEIR CHILDREN OR TO RENT OUT IF

00:34:45.783 --> 00:34:46.350
THEY WISH.

00:34:46.417 --> 00:34:48.419
SO WITH THAT -- I WOULD REQUEST

00:34:48.486 --> 00:34:50.054
FULLY QUESTION I VOTED IN WITH

THANK YOU TO THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER

00:50:59.923 --> 00:51:01.992
CHANGES AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL I

00:51:02.058 --> 00:51:02.993
THINK IT'S SOME IT'S BEEN

00:51:03.059 --> 00:51:04.127
IMPORTANT AND THERE'S NO

00:51:04.194 --> 00:51:06.596
QUESTION THAT -- THOSE CHANGES

00:51:06.663 --> 00:51:08.331
ARE GONNA.

00:51:08.398 --> 00:51:11.034
BE OOD FOR THE COMMUNITY I JUST

00:51:11.101 --> 00:51:12.936
HAVE A QUESTION THIS IS FAIRLY

00:51:13.003 --> 00:51:15.105
UNUSUAL IN TERMS OF A WAY TO DO

00:51:15.172 --> 00:51:17.441
BUSINESS -- IS THERE ANY OTHER

00:51:17.507 --> 00:51:19.509
COUNTY THAT HAS -- THIS KIND OF

00:51:19.576 --> 00:51:23.213
ISSUE.

00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:29.886
NOT THAT I'M AWARE OF I WOULD

00:51:29.953 --> 00:51:31.521
SAY THAT -- SPEAKING ON BEHALF

00:51:31.588 --> 00:51:32.923
OF THE EIGHTEEN METROPOLITAN

00:51:32.989 --> 00:51:34.658
PLANNING ORGANIZATION THERE'S NO

00:51:34.724 --> 00:51:36.593
EASY PATHWAY TO THE NEXT ROUND

00:51:36.660 --> 00:51:37.327
OF TARGETS.

00:51:37.394 --> 00:51:40.730
SENDEK SITUATION IS UNIQUE BUT I

00:51:40.797 --> 00:51:42.766
KNOW THAT FOR EXAMPLE AMONG THE

00:51:42.833 --> 00:51:45.268
OTHER LARGE NPOS THE SACRAMENTO

00:51:45.335 --> 00:51:47.204
AREA COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS.

00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:48.905
IS ALSO STRUGGLING TO MEET THEIR

00:51:48.972 --> 00:51:51.441
TARGET A 19% AND ARE SEEKING

00:51:51.508 --> 00:51:53.643
SOME NEW BUDGET INVESTMENTS THAT

00:51:53.710 --> 00:51:56.313
THEY THAT THEY'RE ASKING YOU.

00:51:56.379 --> 00:51:56.847
FOR SO THE THIRD DIFFERENT

00:51:56.913 --> 00:51:59.716
PATHWAYS TO GET TO WHAT THAT FIX

00:51:59.783 --> 00:52:00.917
THE IS.

00:52:00.984 --> 00:52:02.853
BUT THE ROAD THE THE ROAD TO

00:52:02.919 --> 00:52:05.121
ACHIEVING MORE MORE REDUCTIONS

00:52:05.188 --> 00:52:07.491
WITH EACH PERCENTAGE INCREASE IT

00:52:07.557 --> 00:52:09.426
GETS TOUGHER AND TOUGHER BECAUSE

00:52:09.493 --> 00:52:10.727
THE LOW HANGING FRUIT IS GONE.

00:52:10.794 --> 00:52:13.263
SO -- I THINK I THINK THAT THIS

00:52:13.330 --> 00:52:15.365
IS A VERY GOOD PILOT IS HOW I

00:52:15.432 --> 00:52:16.266
KIND OF THINK ABOUT IT TO SEE

00:52:16.333 --> 00:52:18.034
YOU B	C IF YOU CAN ACTUALLY GO

00:52:18.101 --> 00:52:19.669
BACK AND RETOOL.

00:52:19.736 --> 00:52:21.304
I SUSPECT THAT SOME OF THE

00:52:21.371 --> 00:52:22.906
VISION IN THAT THEY COME BACK

00:52:22.973 --> 00:52:23.940
WITH -- GOING TO PUSH US ALL IN

00:52:24.007 --> 00:52:25.809
A POLICY STANDPOINT TO FIGURE

00:52:25.876 --> 00:52:27.878
OUT HOW WE CAN OUR OUR WE'RE ALL

00:52:27.944 --> 00:52:29.246
GOING TO GET THERE TO MEET THE

00:52:29.312 --> 00:52:29.446
GOAL.

00:52:29.513 --> 00:52:31.648
SO THAT'S AND IF I CAN --

00:52:31.715 --> 00:52:33.950
SENATOR YOU MAY REMEMBER WHEN I

00:52:34.017 --> 00:52:35.185
DID THE BILL BEFORE IN FACT A

00:52:35.252 --> 00:52:36.353
LOT OF YOU I HAD EXTENSIVE

00:52:36.419 --> 00:52:39.189
CONVERSATIONS WITH -- PROBABLY

00:52:39.256 --> 00:52:41.591
AT THE TIME I THINK ON LOCAL GOV --

00:52:41.658 --> 00:52:43.293
IT WAS UNUSUAL WHAT WE DID THEN

00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:44.961
AND WE UP ENDED THE ENTIRE

00:52:45.028 --> 00:52:47.697
AGENCY IN YOU IT IS -- ALMOST

00:52:47.764 --> 00:52:49.366
LIKE NIGHT AND DAY AND SO WHAT I

00:52:49.432 --> 00:52:50.967
THINK WE WOULD HAVE HAD BEFORE

00:52:51.034 --> 00:52:52.369
THIS KIND OF TOTAL

00:52:52.435 --> 00:52:59.075
REORGANIZATION AND AN SOMETHING

00:52:59.142 --> 00:52:59.709
THAT IN IT OUT REALLY GOOD FOR

00:52:59.776 --> 00:53:01.545
ENTIRE REGION -- I WOULD ARGUE.

00:53:01.611 --> 00:53:02.412
DEFINITELY THE PART THAT I LIVE

00:53:02.479 --> 00:53:03.747
IN -- ENDED UP HAVING NEW

00:53:03.813 --> 00:53:05.282
LEADERSHIP HAVING NEW VISION

00:53:05.348 --> 00:53:07.117
INCLUDING THE VOICES OF PEOPLE

00:53:07.183 --> 00:53:09.052
WHO HADN'T BEEN IN SOME OF THE

00:53:09.119 --> 00:53:10.520
REGIONAL PLANNING WE WE COULD

00:53:10.587 --> 00:53:12.556
THEY COULD DO A PLAN IT WON'T

00:53:12.622 --> 00:53:13.456
MEET ITS GOALS.

00:53:13.523 --> 00:53:15.358
IT THEY'LL KNOW THAT IT'S IT'S

00:53:15.425 --> 00:53:17.494
NOT A GOOD PLAN THEY'LL GET SUED --

00:53:17.561 --> 00:53:18.828
AND WILL BE IN COURT AND THEY'LL

00:53:18.895 --> 00:53:20.463
HAVE TO GO MAKE A NEW PLAN I I

00:53:20.530 --> 00:53:22.265
THINK IT'S A GESTURE OF GOOD

00:53:22.332 --> 00:53:25.001
WILL THAT THE LEADERSHIP IN EVEN.

00:53:25.068 --> 00:53:27.304
ALL SIDES OF KIND OF THE DEBATE

00:53:27.370 --> 00:53:28.805
ON WHERE WE'RE GOING WITH WITH

00:53:28.872 --> 00:53:30.206
PUBLIC TRANSIT AND WITH

00:53:30.273 --> 00:53:32.142
INVESTMENTS IN TRANSIT AND

00:53:32.208 --> 00:53:33.877
REDUCING GREENHOUSE GASES WERE

00:53:33.944 --> 00:53:34.377
NOT.

00:53:34.444 --> 00:53:35.445
MONOLITHIC IN OUR COUNTY ABOUT

00:53:35.512 --> 00:53:36.980
WHERE WE SHOULD GO BUT DESPITE

00:53:37.047 --> 00:53:38.415
THAT EVERYBODY WHETHER IT'S THE

00:53:38.481 --> 00:53:39.482
ENVIRONMENTALISTS THE BUSINESS

00:53:39.549 --> 00:53:41.284
COMMUNITY PEOPLE WHO WANT MORE

00:53:41.351 --> 00:53:42.185
ROADS PEOPLE WHO WANT MORE

00:53:42.252 --> 00:53:43.820
TRANSIT ARE ALL ON BOARD WITH

00:53:43.887 --> 00:53:45.855
THIS -- APPROACH BECAUSE WE'VE

00:53:45.922 --> 00:53:48.224
NEVER HAD COMMUNITY INPUT LIKE

00:53:48.291 --> 00:53:48.792
THAT SO WE'VE NEVER HAD THE

00:53:48.858 --> 00:53:50.694
ABILITY SO I UNDERSTAND IT'S

00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:52.729
UNUSUAL -- AND AND I KNOWS

00:53:52.796 --> 00:53:53.797
DIFFERENT COUNTIES PROBABLY ARE

00:53:53.863 --> 00:53:55.065
DEALING WITH DIFFERENT THINGS

00:53:55.131 --> 00:53:57.167
BUT WE WE TRULY BECAUSE OF OF

00:53:57.233 --> 00:53:58.902
SCANDALS IN BECAUSE OF A A

00:53:58.969 --> 00:53:59.903
VOTING STRUCTURE THAT REALLY

00:53:59.970 --> 00:54:01.938
LEFT COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE OUT

00:54:02.005 --> 00:54:03.239
OF THE OUT OF THE COMMUNITY.

00:54:03.306 --> 00:54:05.308
THE PROCESS OF ENGAGEMENT FOR

00:54:05.375 --> 00:54:07.377
DECADES -- WERE IN A UNIQUE

00:54:07.444 --> 00:54:08.778
POSITION AND I KNOW.

00:54:08.845 --> 00:54:10.180
IT'S KIND OF FUNNY TO LOOK AT

00:54:10.246 --> 00:54:11.181
THIS COMMITTEE BECAUSE I KNOW --

00:54:11.247 --> 00:54:12.616
CENTER WOULD HOUSE HE HAD

00:54:12.682 --> 00:54:13.883
PROBLEMS WITH MY BILL AND EIGHT

00:54:13.950 --> 00:54:14.718
I CAN'T ON THIS ONLY WAY WE CAN

00:54:14.784 --> 00:54:16.286
DO IT I KNOW I WORKED REALLY

00:54:16.353 --> 00:54:17.954
HARD WITH -- CENTER MCGUIRE -- I

00:54:18.021 --> 00:54:19.055
KNOW YOU DON'T LIKE THE FACT

00:54:19.122 --> 00:54:20.423
THAT WE WERE DOING LOCAL

00:54:20.490 --> 00:54:22.726
GOVERNMENT FROM HERE AND SO WE

00:54:22.792 --> 00:54:23.960
WE I HAD SO MANY OF THESE

00:54:24.027 --> 00:54:24.961
CONVERSATIONS BUT NOW WE'RE IN A

00:54:25.028 --> 00:54:27.130
POSITION WHERE IN A MUCH BETTER-SPOT I THINK EVERYBODY WOULD IT.

00:54:27.197 --> 00:54:32.802
NOT EVERYBODY MOST PEOPLE WOULD

00:54:32.869 --> 00:54:33.870
AGREE THAT.

00:54:33.937 --> 00:54:35.238
DEATH THE MAJORITY OF THE COUNTY

00:54:35.305 --> 00:54:36.239
WOULD AGREE TO THAT -- AND WE'RE

00:54:36.306 --> 00:54:36.806
JUST TRYING TO GET THIS --

00:54:36.873 --> 00:54:37.374
TRANSPORTATION PLAN RIGHT SO

00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:38.041
THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY REDUCE

00:54:38.108 --> 00:54:39.476
GREENHOUSE GASES SO SO I

00:54:39.542 --> 00:54:41.144
APPRECIATE THAT AND I THE REASON

00:54:41.211 --> 00:54:43.146
FOR THE QUESTION IS THAT -- MANY

00:54:43.213 --> 00:54:45.215
TIMES WE DO ONE OFF BILLS.

00:54:45.281 --> 00:54:47.951
AND AND THERE AND THEN THERE'S A

00:54:48.018 --> 00:54:48.952
BUNCH OF PEOPLE WAITING IN LINE

00:54:49.019 --> 00:54:50.053
AFTERWARDS THAT ARE SAYING WORK

00:54:50.120 --> 00:54:51.388
WE'RE HAVING THE SAME ISSUES AND

00:54:51.454 --> 00:54:53.056
SO I WANT TO BE FAIR.

00:54:53.123 --> 00:54:55.025
IN THIS PROCESS -- BUT I ALSO

00:54:55.091 --> 00:54:56.960
WANT TO BE VERY TRANSPARENT

00:54:57.027 --> 00:54:58.461
ABOUT ABOUT WHAT WHAT WE'RE

00:54:58.528 --> 00:54:59.963
DOING HERE AND MAYBE WHAT WE

00:55:00.030 --> 00:55:02.632
NEED TO DO IS GO BACK AND RETOOL.

00:55:02.699 --> 00:55:03.867
THE DATES.

00:55:03.933 --> 00:55:05.535
AND HOW WE SET UP THE

00:55:05.602 --> 00:55:06.936
OBLIGATIONS BECAUSE THERE THE

00:55:07.003 --> 00:55:08.538
BOTTOM LINE IS WE'VE SET THESE

00:55:08.605 --> 00:55:09.906
ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS.

00:55:09.973 --> 00:55:11.408
AND WE SAID EVERYBODY HAS TO

00:55:11.474 --> 00:55:12.075
ACHIEVE THEM.

00:55:12.142 --> 00:55:13.543
AND THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES YOU

00:55:13.610 --> 00:55:15.645
WON'T GET TRANSPORTATION DOLLARS

00:55:15.712 --> 00:55:17.781
IF YOU'RE NOT ARE YOU.

00:55:17.847 --> 00:55:18.415
OR YOUR AIR BOARD IS NOT GOING

00:55:18.481 --> 00:55:19.449
TO GET THAT THERE ARE

00:55:19.516 --> 00:55:20.750
CONSEQUENCES.

00:55:20.817 --> 00:55:29.192
AND AND MY CONCERN AND I'M GONNA

00:55:29.259 --> 00:55:29.893
I'M GONNA SUPPORT IF YOU'VE DONE.

00:55:29.959 --> 00:55:30.760
GOOD WORK ON IT BUT BUT IN

00:55:30.827 --> 00:55:32.696
REALITY WHAT WHAT WE'RE DOING IS

00:55:32.762 --> 00:55:33.763
WE'RE TAKING AN OLD SECRET

00:55:33.830 --> 00:55:36.032
DOCUMENT THAT IS NOT GOING TO BE

00:55:36.099 --> 00:55:38.601
APPLICABLE. TO THE NEW WHATEVER

00:55:38.668 --> 00:55:41.037
IS GOING TO BE AND AND SO IT'S

00:55:41.104 --> 00:55:42.806
SIXTY CA EXEMPTION RIGHT --

00:55:42.872 --> 00:55:44.674
AND I AND I IT AND IT WE JUST

00:55:44.741 --> 00:55:46.142
NEED TO ASK WE NEED TO CALL THIS

00:55:46.209 --> 00:55:48.111
OUT AND SAY MAYBE WHAT WE NEED

00:55:48.178 --> 00:55:49.746
TO DO IS IF WE HAVE OTHER

00:55:49.813 --> 00:55:50.980
COUNTIES THAT MIGHT BE.

00:55:51.047 --> 00:55:52.148
IN THE IN A VERY SIMILAR

00:55:52.215 --> 00:55:55.485
