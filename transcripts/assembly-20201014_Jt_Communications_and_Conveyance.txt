I THANK ALL MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO IS WHO IS- HERE WITH US TODAY OR IS LISTENING TO US- VIDEO CONFERENCING. THIS ISSUE THIS ISSUE IS ONE OF MOST IMPORTANT ISSUES THAT WE'RE FACING. TODAY THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT DIGITAL DIVIDES ABOUT TECHNOLOGY AND THE ABILITY TO EDUCATE OUR YOUNG PEOPLE I SAY THIS UP TO KIDS. A FOUR YEAR OLD AND A SEVEN YEAR OLD AND WHILE WE ARE. WHILE WE ARE BLESSED ENOUGH TO HAVE. INTERNET CONNECTION AND THE TECHNOLOGICAL SUPPORT WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S STILL SOME LIMITATIONS WHEN YOU PUT ONE OR TWO KIDS ON THERE AND WHEN YOU DO GET WHEN YOU DO ZOOM CALLS. EDUCATE ONE GETS KNOCKED OFF WITH THE GETS KNOCKED OFF AND- WHILE EXPLORING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE AND THE TECHNOLOGICAL ISSUES THAT ARISE THERE'S ALSO THAT ISSUE- OF INSTRUCTIONAL OF INSTRUCTION AND HOW A KID LEARNS. AND WHAT THEY RETAIN AND HOW TO TEST SO IT'S KIND OF A MULTIPLICITY OF PROBLEMS. AND EVEN EVEN TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK AT QUIET SPACE FOR A KID TO LEARN IN A COMPUTER DOESN'T BECOMING UP BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO HAVE HEADSETS. IT'S A NUMBER IT'S A NUMBER OF ISSUES HAVE BECOME VERY VERY DIFFICULT TOUGH. TO NAVIGATE. AND THEN WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK AT INCOME CALL INCOME INEQUALITY ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND YOU TAKE A LOOK AT DISTRICTS I REPRESENT- LIKE THE ONES REPRESENT WHO I KNOW MANY OF YOU REPRESENT COMMUNITIES THAT ARE THE LIKE- THEY'RE SERIOUS. INCOME INEQUALITY ISSUES THAT WERE THAT THAT HAVE BEEN. EXACERBATED DURING COLDER THE ATTAINMENT LEVEL THE ABILITY TO EDUCATE KIDS AND GENERATIONS OF THE POTENTIALLY BIT LEFT BEHIND OTHER RESPONSIBILITY THAT WE BEAR NOW. I SAY THIS BECAUSE IT DIDN'T TAKE A REPORT AND TAKE A STUDY DIDN'T TAKE A NEWS ARTICLE- TO TELL US WHAT WE HEAR EVERY SINGLE DAY WHEN WE'RE WALKING AROUND OUR NEIGHBORHOODS ARE WILL RIDE AT FOOD BANKS. IF YOU WERE POOR IN THE BEFORE THE PANDEMIC HIT. YOU ARE STRUGGLING TO MAKE IT ANOTHER TO PANDEMICS HIT. ALL THE WORSE SCENARIOS OF CAVED IN PEOPLE. WHO ARE WHO ARE STRUGGLING BEFORE. AND WHILE WE'RE DOING OUR VERY BEST I THINK IT'S TAKE IT AT LEAST FOR ME IT'S IMPORTANT KNOWLEDGE- THAT EVERYTHING IS NOT ROSY. EVERYTHING'S NOT PERFECT BUT THERE ARE SERIOUS PROBLEMS- THERE ARE SERIOUS PROBLEMS IN OUR IT IN OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM AND IN THE DISTANCE LEARNING. AND WE'VE GOT TO BEGIN TO TALK ABOUT THOSE PRESENT PROBLEMS IMMEDIATELY AND BEGIN TO TALK ABOUT WHAT WE DO- ONCE RATHER THIS PANDEMIC SOME PEOPLE TALK ABOUT GO BACK TO THE NORM. BUT THE BUT THE THAN THE NORMAL IS NOT WORKING FOR PEOPLE. AND ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE POOR AN INCREASE IN INCOME INEQUALITY HIT YOU THE HARDEST. THE TICKET IS PANDEMIC AN ESSENTIAL WORKERS ARE STILL GOING OUT TO WORK. NOT UNIQUE TO MY DISTRICT. IT'S SURPRISING TO SOME THAT FOLKS WILL HAVE TO LEAVE THEIR HOMES TO GO TO WORK AND THAT THE BUSES ARE STILL BEING USED AT THE METRO STILL BEING USED BECAUSE OF YOUR POOREST CHILDREN YOU DIDN'T HAVE A CAR BEFORE YOU CAN GET A CAR DURING THE PANDEMIC. A STRUGGLE BEFORE YOU STILL HAVE TO STRUGGLE YOU STILL HAVE TO WORK. SO I THINK. THOSE WHO HAVE COME HERE TODAY I TELL TO ENGAGE ON THIS VERY NARAL- THE SENATE NARAL ISSUE BUT INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT ISSUE AS IT RELATES TO EDUCATE OUR KIDS EDUCATING OUR KIDS- AND THE DIGITAL DIVIDE NO ONE HAND OFF THE MISTER O'DONNELL WILL TAKE IT BACK AND THEN- ALLOW MEMBERS IF THEY CHOOSE TO SPEAK. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR SANTIAGO AND THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE LEAD ON THIS HEARING IN CALLING ME UP AND SAY HEY COULD WE- WE HAVE A JOINT HEARING ON THIS VERY VERY IMPORTANT TOPIC. WE'RE HERE TODAY WITH A NARROW FOCUS. TO EXAMINE STUDENTS ACCESS TO THE INTERNET. IN THIS NEW ERA OF DISTANCE LEARNING. NOT NECESSARILY TO DISCUSS THE EFFICACY OF DISTANCE LEARNING BECAUSE WE KNOW IT'S LIMITED. I HAVE TWO KIDS I'M A TEACHER. DISTANCE LEARNING IS NOT. IN CLASSROOM LEARNING I THINK WE ALL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE WANT OUR KIDS BACK IN THE CLASSROOM BUT TO I THINK THAT THIS MAY ALTER THE WAY KIDS LEARN GOING FORWARD TO SOME EXTENT TO WHERE THEY WILL DO DISTANCE LEARNING AND IN CLASSROOM LEARNING MEANING. YOU KNOW POST CLASSROOM EXPERIENCE WILL BE MORE LEARNING TAKING PLACE ON ON THE COMPUTER AFTER THE STANDARD SCHOOL THEY IN THE FUTURE. AND I REPRESENT A DISTRICT THAT'S VERY URBAN IN NATURE BUT ALSO A VERY RURAL HAVE CATALINA ISLAND THEY HAVE UNLIMITED INTERNET ACCESS ON CATALINA ISLAND. THERE'S KIDS THAT LIVE ON CATALINA. GIVES THE NEED TO LEARN AND- SO THIS IS VERY IMPACTFUL TO MY DISTRICT AND I HOPE OUR HEARING TODAY WILL FOCUS ON SOLUTIONS NOT JUST RE IDENTIFYING THE PROBLEM. ARE RE EXPLAINING THE PROBLEM IS I THINK WE ALL ACKNOWLEDGE. THERE IS A PROBLEM AND IT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. ACCORDING NUMEROUS PUBLICATIONS INCLUDING EDUCATION WEEK REMOTE LEARNING CONTINUES TO BE OUT OF REACH FOR MILLIONS OF STUDENTS NATIONWIDE. WHO LACK A RELIABLE INTERNET CONNECTION AT HOME THUS THE TOPIC TODAY. TODAY WE WILL HEAR ABOUT MEASURES CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS AND AGENCIES HAVE TAKEN TO ENSURE RELIABLE ACCESS TO THE INTERNET WE ALSO HEAR FROM TEACHERS AND ADMINISTRATORS ON THE GROUND ABOUT THE CHALLENGES FACED TO DISTANCE LEARNING. WHEN ACCESS IS LIMITED OR NON EXISTENT AS WE NEED TO REMEMBER. THAT SOME KIDS MIGHT LIVE IN AN AREA-WHERE THERE IS ACCESS OR POTENTIAL ACCESS SOME KIDS LIVING AREA WHERE THEY CANNOT EVEN ACCESS THE INTERNET. FINE WE'LL HEAR FROM THE INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER COMMUNITY AND A COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION MAKING STRIDES TO EXPAND ACCESS FOR THE STUDENTS AND FAMILIES. WITH THE GREATEST NEED. DUE TO THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC MOST LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES ARE PROVIDING INSTRUCTION THROUGH DISTANCE LEARNING OR HYBRID MODEL WAS STUDENTS ATTENDING SUNDAY'S IN PERSON AND OTHER DAYS DISTANCE LEARNING OR JUST STROLLING. DISTANCE LEARNING IN THE CASE OF MY OWN HOME SITUATION. AND AGAIN YOU KNOW I DO NEED TO APPLAUD THAT A LOT OF SCHOOLS WILL SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACROSS THE STATE RESPONDED HANDLING OF THIS CRISIS THEY DIDN'T EVEN HAVE ENOUGH LAPTOPS. I CAN TELL YOU I. WENT BY ONE OF MY HIGH SCHOOL SERVICE TWELVE HUNDRED PEOPLE IN LINE TO GET. TO GET TO GET A COMPUTER LA UNIFIED'S THE DONE A GREAT JOB WITH THE TOOLS THAT THEY HAD TO SERVE THEIR STUDENTS EVERYBODY'S TRYING IT'S JUST NOT ENOUGH. THUS AGAIN THE TOPIC OF TODAY'S CONVERSATION. SB NINETY EIGHT THE EDUCATION TRAILER BILL OF THE SESSION PROVIDED DEFINITIONS AND GUARDRAILS FOR OUR NEW NORMAL DISTANCE LEARNING. LOCAL AGENT EDUCATION AGENCIES THAT PROVIDE DISTANCE LEARNING. ARE REQUIRED TO CONFIRM OR PROVIDE ACCESS FOR CONNECTIVITY. AND DEVICES ADEQUATE. TO PARTICIPATE IN THE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM AND COMPLETE ASSIGNED WORK. ENSURING ACCESS TO DISTANCE LEARNING THROUGH INTERNET CONNECTIVITY. IS MORE THAN A REQUIREMENT IT IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. BUT THE SOLUTIONS TO CONNECTIVITY ARE NOT ALWAYS SIMPLE OR STRAIGHTFORWARD. THERE ARE MANY ISSUES TO GRAPPLE WITH BUT FUNDAMENTALLY OUR QUESTION TODAY IS HOW CAN WE WORK THROUGH THE BARRIER STERN INTERNET CONNECTIVITY. IN ORDER FOR SCHOOLS TO SET UP OUR STUDENTS. FOR SUCCESS IN A DISTANCE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT WHICH AGAIN WE ACKNOWLEDGE. IS NOT THE PERFECT ENVIRONMENT TO LEARN. THERE'LL BE MANY QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS TODAY I LOOK FORWARD TO. TO HEARING THEM I KNOW THE LAST YEAR THERE WERE TWO KEY BILLS. SENATOR GONZALEZ HAD ONE- IT'S SPOKE MOSTLY TO SPEED I THINK THERE ORIGINALLY WAS MONEY IN IT. BUT THEN WAS PULLED OUT FOR SOME REASON SIMILAR AGAR CURRY HAD ANOTHER BILL THAT SPOKE TO MONEY AND ACCESS. AND IN ONE NIGHT. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT MONEY HAS TO BE AN ONGOING SOURCE. EVEN UPON QUITE FRANKLY IS REALLY A YOU KNOW FOR ONE TIME EXPENDITURES CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS. BUT WE NEED TO IDENTIFY AN ONGOING SOURCE TO SUPPORT CONNECTIVITY ACROSS OUR STATE SUPPORTER STUDENTS AND ULTIMATELY OUR ECONOMY THIS MAN IS COMMUNITIES THAT DON'T HAVE CONNECTIVITY AT ALL. IT'S NOT GOING TO MUCH ISSUE AS MUCH AS IT IS AN EDUCATIONAL ISSUE WITH THAT I'LL TURN IT BACK TO YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU. I'LL JUST ASK MONEY OUT FIRST OF FIRST PERSON REQUESTED I'LL DO IT THAT WAY RIGHT TO. THE FIRST ONE I SAW WAS MISSING MISTER SMITH PLEASE. HERE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I'M THANK YOU TO BOTH CHAIRMAN TODAY AS WELL AS YOUR STAFF FOR BRINGING THIS DATA TOGETHER FOR THIS BRIEFING AT HIGHER I COULDN'T BE MORE PLEASED TO BE HERE TODAY THIS IS LITERALLY THE WORK THAT LAUNCHED MY CAREER IN PUBLIC POLICY AND MY OWN CHILDREN SCHOOL DISTRICT TWELVE YEARS AGO WE REALIZED WE HAD A SIGNIFICANT FUNDING GAP NOT ONLY IN THE ACCESS BUT SIMPLY THE HARDWARE IN ORDER TO INVEST TO MAKE OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY THAT IT NEEDED JUST TO MEET STATE STANDARDS AT THE TIME AND THAT WAS FIBER OPTICS FROM THE STREET INTO THE CLASSROOM. THAT WAS ENOUGH EQUIPMENT FOR EVERY CHILD TO HAVE SOME KIND OF ACCESS DURING THEIR SCHOOL DAY AND DURING THEIR SCHOOL WEEK AND AS WE HAVE FOUND SADLY DURING THIS CRISIS THAT THOSE FRACTURES IN THE HAVES AND THE HAVE NOTS IN OUR SYSTEM HAVE BEEN LAID STARKLY BARE AND AS E GO THROUGH THIS- TO GERMINAL DONALD'S POINT WE MUST REMEMBER THAT THERE WERE DISTRICTS ALREADY IN THIS STATE THAT DIDN'T HAVE EVEN ACCESS PERIOD TO THE INTERNET WE STILL HAD SCHOOLS AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THE STATE WITH NO INTERNET ACCESS LET ALONE THOSE STUDENTS AND FAMILIES HAVING ACCESS. IN THEIR HOMES SO THE URGENCY GIVEN THE MOMENT OF THE CODE CRISIS IS VERY REAL BUT I HOPE THAT AS WE ARE PROBLEM SOLVING HERE WE THINK VERY EXTENSIVELY VERY EXPANSIVELY AND LOOK TO THE REAL NEED FOR ON GOING FUNDING FOR TECHNOLOGICAL INVESTMENT FOR ALL OF OUR KIDS AND OUR SCHOOLS IN THE STATE THIS CAN'T BE A ONE TIME ONE AND DONE THOUGHT PROCESS IT IS NOW INTEGRAL TO EVERYTHING THAT OUR STUDENTS NEED TO THEIR DAILY LEARNING AND WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE MAKING THE COMMITMENT FINANCIALLY TO ENSURE THAT THIS HAPPENS ON AN ONGOING BASIS. THEY JUST SIMPLIFY RATHER THAN TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHO PUT IT THERE MIKE'S FIRST GIVE IF I GO THIS WAY. SECRETARY FIFTH UNDERSTANDING THIS ONE WITH. A FIRST OF ALL I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AS WELL AS A ASSEMBLY MEMBER O'DONNELL FRINGE THEN YOU JOIN TODAY. TO DISCUSS ONE. IF NOT THE MOST RELEVANT ISSUES CALIFORNIANS ARE FACING TODAY. ACROSS OUR STATE ESPECIALLY THROUGHOUT RURAL CALIFORNIA STUDENTS IN THE WORKING FAMILIES STILL REMAIN WITHOUT ACCESS TO INTERNET CONNECTIVITY AT SPEEDS. ABLE TO FOR DISTANCE LEARNING CONNECTOR WORKFORCE TO GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT HARNESS THE LIFESAVING TECHNOLOGY OF TELEMEDICINE. ENABLE FOR PRECISION AGRICULTURE AND SUSTAIN ECONOMIC TRANSITIONS IN TIMES OF EMERGENCIES. WE HAVE ALL SEEN FIRST HAND HOW CRITICAL CONNECTIVITY KATE CAPACITY IS THE TIMES OF EMERGENCIES. INCLUDING DURING THE STATE'S RECENT DEVASTATING FIRES. XCELERATED AN ONGOING NEED FOR BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE NECESSARY TO CONNECT OUR STUDENTS AND FAMILIES CANNOT BE IGNORED. SO AS WE KNOW THIS PAST SESSION OFFERED SB FIVE SEVENTY THAT WOULD HAVE PROVIDED THE NECESSARY FUNDING FOR DEPLOYMENT ABROAD GRANT BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE CALIFORNIA'S MOST VULNERABLE UNSERVED AND UNDERSERVED RURAL AND URBAN AREAS AND AS MANY OF YOU REMEMBER THE PRESSING NEED FOR PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING IS NOT NEW TO ME. REMEMBER I AUTHORED A CA ONE THAT WOULD HAVE HELPED SECURE FUNDING FOR BROADBAND EXPANSION IN UNDERSERVED AREAS. BOTH SENATOR LE GONZALEZ ALINA GONZALEZ WHO AUTHORED IF YOU WANT THE ELEVEN THIRTY AND I AGREE. THAT WE MUST PROVIDE INTERNET SPEEDS TO ACCOMMODATE NEEDS FOR DISTANCE LEARNING TELEHEALTH SUCCESSFUL OPERATIONS OF SMALL BUSINESSES INTO THE FUTURE. AND AT THE END OF THE SESSION THE SENATOR AND MINISTRATION CAME AROUND ON THE CRITICAL NEED TO SECURE FUNDING AS PART OF A BILL PACKAGE SO THAT HIGH PROPERTY UNDERSERVED UNSERVED COMMUNITIES ARE FIRST IN LINE TO THE RESOURCES VITAL TO STAY SAFE. DURING THIS PANDEMIC AND RECOVER FROM THE ECONOMIC RECESSION. I ALSO. THE SUPPORT FOR MISTER SPEAKER ON OUR BROADBAND EFFORTS THIS YEAR AND I AM HOPEFUL THAT MY COLLEAGUES LEADERSHIP IN BOTH HOUSES. AND THE ADMINISTRATION CAN JOIN ME IN RESOLVING ANY REMAINING DIFFERENCES THAT WE MAY. THAT WE CAN PASS LEGISLATION FAST IN THE BEGINNING OF THE NEXT SESSION. I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE OUR COLLABORATION WITH ALL MEMBERS INTERESTED IN BEING A PART OF THIS CONVERSATION SO WE CAN WORK TOGETHER AND GET SOMETHING DONE FOR OUR COMMUNITIES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I WANT TO AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES BUT I WANT TO KIND OF PAINT THE PICTURE AND BACK UP FOR A MOMENT. AND THAT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE IS. OVER A DECADE AGO TEN FIFTEEN YEARS AGO SOME SCHOOL STARTED FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS STARTED INVESTING. AND NOT ONLY INTERNET BUT DEVICES IPADS SO FOR. IT WAS VERY CLEAR TO ME AS A CLASSROOM TEACHER EVEN WITHIN A DISTRICT. THAT WAS INVESTING THERE ARE THERE WERE INEQUITIES. MEANING THAT SOME KIDS NOT ONLY HAD ACCESS TO IPADS- ALL TYPES OF DEVICES IN THE CLASSROOM BUT ALSO AT HOME. IF YOU JUMP AHEAD NOW TO WHERE WE ARE THAT STILL EXISTS SO THIS HAS JUST MADE IT VERY CLEAR WHAT WE CAN ALREADY SEE WHICH DEPENDING ON THE DISTRICT YOU WERE SENDING YOUR CHILD TO OR THE SCHOOL. THAT YOUR CHILD ATTENDED A COULD BE THE SAME A SCHOOL WITHIN A DISTRICT YOU COULD HAVE VERY DIFFERENT. EXPERIENCES WITH NOT ONLY- USING COMPUTERS UP BEING TRAIN SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS WERE GIVING ACCESS TO A FOUR YEAR OLD PRE K. NOT ONLY ON KEYBOARDING BUT ALL THE EXPERIENCES- THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOUR CHILD. AND THEN A VERY SUCCINCT PROGRAM FROM KINDERGARTEN ALL THE WAY THROUGH TWELFTH GRADE OTHERS AHEAD NO DEVICES IN HIGH SCHOOL MAYBE A FEW OF THE COURSES OR EXPERIENCES. BUT WE SAW THE INEQUITIES WITH THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA- BASICALLY OVER THE LAST DECADE SO NOW AS WE SEE OUR CRISIS THAT GOES EVEN DEEPER AND WE SEE- IT ISN'T EVEN IF A CHILD HAS A DEVICE OR A FAMILY HOUSING HOT SPOT. IT ISN'T EVEN IF THERE'S TWO OR THREE DEVICES WHAT'S EVEN DEEPER THAN THAT IS WHAT KIND OF EXPERIENCE ARE THESE CHILDREN ARE FAMILIES. HAVING AT HOME SOME FAMILIES HAVE A PARENT THAT IS HOME THAT CAN KIND OF INTERFACE WITH THE LEARNING WELL THEY'RE DOING THEIR OWN JOB. SOME OF FAMILIES I HAVE NO ONE AT HOME MAYBE AN OLDER BROTHER OR SISTER- THAT IS TRYING TO DO THEIR OWN WORK. ALONG WITH ALSO HELPING YOUNGER SIBLINGS AND THEN AS WE SEEN THE PICTURE THAT WENT VIRAL OF THE TWO YOUNG GIRLS WHO WERE SITTING OUTSIDE. TACO BELL TRYING TO CONNECT SO THESE ARE SERIOUS ISSUES THEIR ISSUES ABOUT EQUITY THEIR ISSUES ABOUT INVESTMENT AND THEIR ISSUES ARE REALLY ABOUT THE FUTURE OF OUR NATION- SO I'M PROUD TO BE HERE AND I'M GONNA BE LISTENING CAREFUL. LEE FOR DETAILS ON NOT JUST ABOUT DO THEY HAVE A DEVICE. BUT WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THAT DEVICE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR GARCIA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRED THE CHAIRMAN OF THE EDUCATION COMMITTEE AND ALL THE COMMENTS BEING MADE BY OUR COLLEAGUES HERE TODAY CLEARLY. I THINK THAT'S BEEN SAID DO WE DISAGREE WITH I JUST WANTED TO. ACKNOWLEDGE SOME OF THE CONVERSATIONS THAT THE CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMUNICATIONS OF CONVEYANCE AND I. BEEN FACILITATING WITH SOME OF THE STAKEHOLDERS AS A FOLLOW UP TO LAST YEAR'S LEGISLATIVE. ATTEMPTS TO MOVE. THIS CONVERSATION FORWARD- THE GOAL OUGHT TO BE THAT. WE BEGIN. ARE THESE TYPE OF STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS- NOW- WITH- YOU KNOW THE INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS THE- SCHOOL DISTRICTS- NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS. AND THE MANY OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO BE ABLE TO PUT TOGETHER A COMPREHENSIVE PACKAGE- IN JANUARY THAT WILL ULTIMATELY LEAD TO THE ON GOING FUNDING. AND CLEARLY THE POLICY- REFORMS THAT ARE NECESSARY TO ALTER THE MEET THE OBJECTIVES- THAT WILL BE DISCUSSING TODAY LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING. WITH EVERYONE HERE ON THESE MATTERS AND- AND LASTLY YOU KNOW- I'M GLAD THAT- MISTER MATTEUCCI- WAS ABLE TO SUBMIT HIS NOTES CLEARLY HE'S TAKING AS A- FLAG IN THE GROUND THAT YOU'LL BE WORKING ON THE BOND AND- LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING. ON THAT MATTER AS WELL THAT ONE TIME FUNDING COULD BE VERY THE CENTRAL. TO HELPING US CLOSE THE GAP IN MANY PARTS OF A RURAL CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS URBAN. AREAS OF CALIFORNIA WHERE THE ISSUE OF SPEED. INTERNET SPEEDS- ARE MUCH NEEDED WHEN IT COMES TO PUBLIC SAFETY SERVICES- BUSINESS- DEVELOPMENT I TELL HEALTH SERVICES AND ALSO THE ISSUE OF EDUCATION THAT MANY OF OUR STUDENTS ARE FACING TODAY SO- WIDE RANGE OF NEED. LOOKING FORWARD TO REALLY TAKING A LEADERSHIP ROLE WITH MY COLLEAGUES HERE- AND THE DISCUSSION TODAY WILL HEAR SOME THINGS THAT WE- ARE PROBABLY KNOW ABOUT ALREADY. BUT WE'LL HOPEFULLY- BEGIN. GUIDING WHAT THE POLICY WILL LOCAL MOVING FORWARD THANK YOU. FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP MISTER CHAIR OF YOU. AND I LOOK TO WORKING ON THESE ISSUES THANK YOU CAN. VISIT MISTER KILEY AND THANK YOU FOR BEING PATIENT FOR ME INSTEAD OF JUST GOING THIS WAY RATHER TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHO PUT UP THEIR MIKE FIRST. NUMBER GIVE YOU IN TIME MISTER CHAIR. I WANNA SAY I FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU FOR. CONVENING THIS- THIS YEAR. YOU KNOW AS A VICE CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY EDUCATION COMMITTEE. I'M GRATEFUL TO FINALLY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS IN A PUBLIC FORUM. THESE ISSUES THAT ARE. IMPACTING MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIA FAMILIES RIGHT NOW ALSO EXPRESSED MY AGREEMENT WITH TWO THINGS MR O'DONNELL SAID DOESN'T HAPPEN ALL THAT OFTEN SO CELEBRATE OR CAN. NUMBER ONE HIS EMPHASIS ON THE IMPORTANCE OF RETURNING THE IN CLASSROOM INSTRUCTION AND NUMBER TWO. HIS POINT THAT. THE TOOLS OF DISTANCE LEARNING CAN BE VALUABLE NOT ONLY IN REPLACING IN CLASSROOM LEARNING BUT ALSO IN COMPLEMENTING AND SUPPLEMENTING IT WE'VE SEEN EVEN BEFORE COVERED NINETEEN MODELS OF BLENDED LEARNING THAT HAVE PROVEN VERY EFFECTIVE AND SO THE WORK THAT IS BEING DONE TO ASSURE UNIVERSAL ACCESS. AND TO IMPROVE THE TOOLS OF DISTANCE LEARNING TO FROM PROVE OUR COLLECTIVE CAPACITY IN OUR INFRASTRUCTURE I THINK HAS THE POTENTIAL TO PAY DIVIDENDS. IN THE LONG TERM. AND ALSO THE WORK THAT IS BEING DONE THAT WE'RE GOING TO HEAR ABOUT TODAY BASED UPON THE MATERIALS IS GENUINELY GOOD WORK. THAT IS HELPING TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE INEQUITIES- THE SITUATION IS CREATED BUT I WANT TO EMPHASIZE. THAT IT IS THE ONLY SMOOTHING OUT THE EDGES OF THE OUTER EDGES OF THE PROBLEM. AND THAT A SCHOOL SHUTDOWN IS INHERENTLY INEQUITABLE IT INHERENTLY WHY DIDN'T THE ACHIEVEMENT GAPS THAT EXIST IN OUR- PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM. AND IT'S DOING ENORMOUS HARM TO ALL CALIFORNIA KIDS AND ALL CALIFORNIA FAMILIES. THE EVIDENCE IS PELLUCIDA THE CLEAR. BEYOND ANY REASONABLE DEBATE. THE HARMS BEING DONE BY KEEPING KIDS OUT OF SCHOOL FAR EXCEED THE RISKS OF CONTRACTING THIS VIRUS. MOREOVER DOCTOR GALLEY RECENTLY SAID THAT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF ANY LINK BETWEEN INCREASED TRANSMISSION AND SCHOOL RE OPENINGS WHERE THEY HAVE OCCURRED. AND THAT IS WHAT THE EVIDENCE HAS SHOWN ALL ALONG AS WELL. THE STATE SHOULD BE DOING EVERYTHING IT CAN. TO GET EVERY SCHOOL IN CALIFORNIA BACK OPEN AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE BUT INSTEAD WE'RE SEEING QUITE THE OPPOSITE. WE'RE SEEING THE STATE AID IN THE BED THOSE WOULD USE SCHOOL CLOSURES FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES WE'RE SEEING NEW REASONS INVENTED. TO KEEP SCHOOLS CLOSED. JUST YESTERDAY A LETTER FROM THREE UNION SAID THAT EVEN SCHOOLS THAT CAN SAFELY REOPEN SHOULD NOT. BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT ANYONE TO GET A HEAD START. THAT IS A MONSTROUS SENTIMENT AND IT'S DOING INCALCULABLE HARM. TO MILLIONS OF KIDS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND WE NEED TO GET OUR SCHOOLS OPEN FOR FULL IN CLASSROOM INSTRUCTION. WITHOUT ANY FURTHER DELAY. THANK YOU MR COLOR NOT SURE IF MISTER O'DONNELL LAMENTS OR OR CELEBRATE. HAVING FAME VIEWPOINT ENTRY CAN APPRECIATE THAT WE WANT FROM LEFT TO RIGHT. THANK YOU HAVING SAID THAT IS THERE ANY OTHER MEMBERS WHO WANT TO MAKE ANY FURTHER COMMENTS. IF NOT I'M GONNA HAND OVER MISTER DONALD OTHER TO POINT OUT ONE THING MS CARTEL THAT THAT THAT PICTURE OF THE TWO KIDS OUTSIDE OF TACO BELL. IF IT'S THE SAME WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT- ONE OF THOSE WELL IT WAS FILMED IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD. SO IT'S BEEN A ONE OF THE MOST PRESSING ISSUES THERE. THANK YOU WILL NOW GO TO OUR FIRST PANEL. AGAIN OUR FIRST PANEL. AND I JUST REMINDER WE WILL HOLD OUR QUESTIONS TO THE END OF THE PANEL TO THE END OF THE PANEL. OUR FIRST PANEL- WILL FOCUS ON- AND PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF DISTANCE LEARNING AND THE DIGITAL DIVIDE.A REMINDER AGAIN THAT WE HOLDING QUESTIONS TO THE AND OUR FIRST SPEAKERS AT EDGAR CABRAL FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE MR ROMERO IS JOINING US FROM A VIDEO CONFERENCING ROOM. AT THE LEGISLATIVE OFFICE- ARE YOU- WHEN YOU'RE READY MISTER MORALITY MAYES PROCEED. GREAT THANK YOU- GOOD MORNING MISTER TURNER THE MEMBERS- AFTER THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S TO. THEM I WOULD HAVE TO PROVIDE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT BROADBAND INTERNET ACCESS AND ADOPTION- TO CONFIRM SOME OF THE CONVERSATIONS- REGARDING THE FACT THAT THE DISTANCE LEARNING. AND I'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE FEW THINGS THAT WE DO KNOW ABOUT. ISSUES RELATED TO MORE SPECIFICALLY STUDENT CONNECTIVITY- WE DID HAVE A HAND OUT THAT ALL USE A VERY VERY KIND OF IT REALLY WASN'T. IF I COULD. WITH BUT ALL BUT I'LL BE WHAT THROUGH SO GOD WANTED TO SPLIT UP THE COVERS THE ENDING MANY OF THE MEMBERS OUR TO TALK ABOUT TWO DIFFERENT ISSUES WHY IS. WHETHER THERE'S A PHYSICAL IN. BUT FOR A PROPERTY INTERNET ACCESS AND IN FACT WHETHER OR NOT A BEING A IN THE HOUSE. ON TOPICS WE FOR TALK ABOUT. ACTORS WERE AVAILABILITY CAL. I'M IN SEASON THREE WITH THAT THE TABLE HAVE HERE STATEWIDE HOW BROADBAND OF THE TO THE THAT'S THE- I THINK MEGABIT PER SUCH DOWNLOADS. I THE SENATOR THE STATE OF QATAR CORRECT CAL PROBABLY COMMISSION USES AND WE DO HAVE SOME INFORMATION ON A HIGHER SPEED THERE YOU CAN SEE IN TERMS STATEWIDE ACCESS IT DOESN'T CHANGE MUCH WOULD BE. ACTOR- YOU COULD SEE IN URBAN AREAS THAT THE- LOCAL PHARMACY WHATEVER IT NINETY EIGHT. POINT MEGABITS PER SECOND STANDARD NINETY SEVEN POINT NINE- IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT A HIGHER STANDARD. AND THIS IS SOMETHING I THINK WE BOTH THE NUMBERS HERE BECAUSE THIS IS AN AREA THAT IS INVOLVING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAVE WITHIN THE- OR ARE GIVEN THE TWO YEARS. A THE HIGH TWENTY FIVE MEGABITS PER SECOND STANDARD AND- AND SO THAT THEY ARE DIFFERENT IN KIND OF A WE SEE FROM NUMBERS FOR AREA CAL THAT WHETHER OR NOT YOU USE ONE. BRING FROM THE MATTER BUT THE ROLE IN THAT DOES CHANGE ARE SOME THEM HOW MANY HEALTHY TO GO BACK SO IF YOU'RE LOOKING THE LOWER EAST. WE'LL BE DOING SECRETIVE CONSTRUCTION- YOU KNOW ON A VIDEO CONFERENCING AND MAYBE HAVING SOME WEBSITES OPEN TO LOOK UP INFORMATION. BUT IF YOU'RE STARTING TO TALK ABOUT THE TWO OR THREE. ACTIVISM HOUSEHOLD TRYING TO ACCESS THIS IS RUNNING AN ADULT WORKING FROM HOME THAT IS NO LONGER ENOUGH AND NOW YOU'RE YOU NEED SOMETHING MORE LIKE THE TWENTY FIVE MEGABITS PER SECOND FOUNDER ABOUT. ONE THING WE POINT OUT TO IT- ALTHOUGH THE ACCESS. OR GROUP AVAILABILITY IS A BIGGER ISSUE CAN IN ON THE WEB. IN RURAL AREAS IF YOU JUST GET TOLD. THAT ARE UNCERTAIN CAL DAMAGE OF THE ARE ACTUALLY URBAN AREAS AND- I MENTIONED IS NOT TO SAY THAT. WE SHOULD BUT THERE ARE. ISSUES IN OUR AREA FOR MORE PRODUCTIVE FOR MEMBERS WHO ARE IN PLACES THAT ARE PRIMARILY URBAN. YOU MIGHT STILL HAVE TO. BUMP OF. THAT DO NOT ACCESS BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE. MOVIES ARE ON. CHU RIVER CEMENT ON NOW. WHAT WAS THE CALL PRODUCT. AND SO THIS IS HOW. THAT HAVE INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE. BETA A WIRED CONNECTION OF THE CLASS WIRED INTERNET AND THEN AROUND. SIX TO. SO BASED ON THE C. P. U. BIG BIG. GAP ANALYSIS. BY YEAH THE RIGHT NUMBER OF THE PERSON OF HEALTH. 80% OF THE WHO. CRITICS TO CHOOSE TO DO. THAT THAT NUMBER. DOES VERY. ACROSS THE STATE THAT THE GOVERNOR ALSO PUT THE- UC. THAT AT A NUMBER OF THEM A- THAT. TO GET A SENSE OF. WHAT WERE THE MAIN DRIVERS OF ME FACTORS THE RESEARCH. WITH HIGHER OR LOWER. ADOPTION RATES AROUND INTERNET. AND THE BONUS POINTS. ARE PROBABLY TOO MANY OF THE CORRELATION. IS STRONG WITHIN. SO I IN IN SAN TRACTS WHERE ABOUT THE AVERAGE ANNUAL INCOME IS A- EIGHTY. DOLLARS YOU HAVE IN ADOPTION RATE OF 86% WHEREAS IN. TRY WHERE. EVERY JANUARY IS TWENTY DOLLARS DOLLARS OR- YOU HAVE ENOUGH TO READ UP. THREE SO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES THERE IS TALKING. OR HOUSEHOLDS- TRACKS WHERE- THERE WERE. A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF HOUSEHOLDS THAT WERE LIMITED ENGLISH SPEAKING WERE ALSO LESS LIKELY TO THE FRONT AND THEN. THE DEFINITION OF LIMITED ENGLISH SPEAKING HERE IS IF YOU'RE IN A HOUSEHOLD WHERE NONE OF THE ADULTS WITH THE THAT THEY SPEAK ENGLISH VERY WELL. AND SO THEY GIVE YOU A COUPLE OF THAT THE DIFFERENCES THERE YEAH THERE'S A- INCLUDE A HIGHER RATE OF. FROM WHICH WERE NOT ACTUALLY BASED ON THE NUMBERS. THAT IT'S BECAUSE THEY CHOSE NOT TO AND THAT MIGHT BE SIGNIFICANTLY CUTS TO INCOME. I'M ALSO. YOU KNOW. LOOKING AT THESE AT THIS INFORMATION COMPARING WITH OUR- KIDS OVER THE CASE SYSTEM. COMING FROM UP THE SPECIFIC THAT THE LAW CONTENT FUNDING. IS TARGETING. LOW INCOME STUDENTS ENGLISH LEARNERS. BUT BASED ON THE GAP AND ALL BILLS ALSO THE WHO ARE. LIKELY TO LIVE IN OUR WHERE THEY MIGHT HAVE BY INTERNET. I'M ONE THING THAT WOULD HAVE GREAT BUT THE GUNS AFTER THERE WAS ANY OF. WE HAD ON. THEM ACCESS IN TRIBAL INTER AREA. WE COULD NOT WE DID NOT FIND SPECIFIC OF MY ON ADULT RATES IN IN REGION BUT WE DID. THAT SOME FEDERAL INFORMATION SHOWS THAT THIS TWENTY FIVE MEGABITS PER SECOND. I TRY. TRIBAL AREAS HOW TO A SIX EIGHT POINT PERCENT OF THE- HAVE ACCESS TO BROADBAND INTERNET SO THAT'S- VERY IN LINE WITH THE ROLE NUMBER STATEWIDE. FARM WHICH IN SOME WAYS NOT SURPRISING GIVEN THAT. MOST OR MANY ACTIONABLE. AREAS ARE IN RURAL AREAS. SO NEXT TIME ON PAGE THREE WE HAVE A LITTLE INFORMATION. SPEAKING SPECIFICALLY ABOUT GOING ON FIRST TO AND SCHOOLS OF THE STATE OF MIND HOW. A LOT OF GOOD SPECIFIC DATA HERE. THE DATA BECAUSE THE HAS COLLECTED HISTORICALLY HAVE BEEN FOCUSED ON ACCESS TO THE INTERNET AT THE SCHOOL SITE- AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PROGRAMS IN PLACE- TO EXPAND ACCESS- FOR EXAMPLE IF YEARS AGO THERE WERE THESE ARE INFRASTRUCTURE GRANTS BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE GRANTS. QUICKLY TARGETED LOWER AND ROTARIANS WERE THERE WAS NO- NO GOOD ACCESS TO HIGH SPEED INTERNET- IN TERMS OF WHAT'S GOING ON AT OUR STUDENTS IS HOW. IT STUDENTS IS A HOMES WE HAVE NOT. HAD A LOT OF DATA ON THAT A BIGGER BIT INCREASING RECOGNITION THAT STUDENTS ARE DOING HOMEWORK AT HOME AND THAT BROADBAND INTERNET ACCESS TO BE HELPFUL. BUT IT'S NOT IN THE MOOD STATE OF COLLECTIVE. FARM I KNOW THE SUPERINTENDENT WILL SPEAK LATER AND- YOU CAN PROBABLY TALK ABOUT- OKAY CAN BE TALKED OUT ABOUT SOME OF THE- THAT WERE. YES OF THE ISSUES THAT WERE GOING ON WE WHEN THE- THIS. FARM WORDS PERCENT BUT THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF A DICK. INFORMATION AND SPRING OF TWO TWENTY AND THAT INITIAL. FOR THAT THERE WAS ABOUT A- EIGHT HUNDRED BLOCK EDUCATION. THAT DID PROVIDE SOME SURVEY RESPONSES THE DEPARTMENT. AND THEN IDENTIFIED A FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND MOBILE OFF. NEED FOR FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND MOBILE HOTSPOT SO DON'T BE I. WONDERED DEVICE THAT YOU COULD GIVE A STUDENTS WHAT THEY COULD ACT TO YOU KNOW. FROM HOME THAT THERE'VE BEEN A NUMBER OF INITIATIVE TO TRY TO ADDRESS THAT INTEREST RIGHT WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE MEETING BUT- BECAUSE OF MY TALKING. BIT ABOUT THAT LATER THE PIECE OF INFORMATION THAT I CAN SHARE WITH YOU AND THIS IS JUST OUR- HAVE A PARTY FOR EXAMPLE. GOING ON. IS THERE WAS A RAN CORPORATION A SURVEY OF TEACHERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. TO GET A SENSE OF WHAT THEIR FIRST. WERE AND- IN THE SURVEY- WHICH YOU GET NOTHING SURVEY BUT THEY FOUND THAT. TEACHERS WHO WERE IN FORTY. IN HIGH. SCHOOLS ARE ONLY ONLY 30% OF THOSE TEACHERS THOUGHT THAT ALL OR NEARLY ALL OF THEIR STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO THE INTERNET FOR DISTANCE LEARNING SO. OUR SYSTEM TO PORTION OF TEACHERS WHO THOUGHT THAT. ALL THE TO DO NOT HAVE ACCESS. THERE COULD BE A NUMBER OF OTHER REASONS WHY THAT- THEY MIGHT NOT THAT PERCEPTION MIGHT BE MIGHT NOT BE DIRECTLY THAT THEY DON'T HAVE INTERNET ACCESS BUT THEY MIGHT BE SHARING A DEVICE. OR MAYBE ACT THE ACCESS IS NOT ENOUGH BUT THAT JUST GIVES YOU A SENSE OF. MAGNITUDE OF THE. PROBLEM IS WITH ON. SO I WAS. THEIR BUT HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY FURTHER. AFTER GO POWER. THANK YOU WILLIAM ON TO A NEXT. AND I WE MIGHT SEE. IN CONSUL WITH THE- MISTER SONNY IF ARE IF CAN SAFELY. SO SOCIAL DISTANCE OF YOU CAN TAKE YOUR MASK OFF BECAUSE I THINK THAT WILL HELP PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE STATEMENTS YOUR YOUR YOUR YOUR TRYING TO CONVEY- AGAIN IF IT'S IF IT'S IF YOU ARE IN A- SAVE SITUATION TO DO THAT SO WE WILL NOW HEAR FROM- SUPERINTEND OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION MISTER TONY THURMAN. WHO IS JOINING US BY PHONE MISTER CHAIRMAN. GOOD MORNING I THANK YOU A TERMINAL DONNELL THANK YOU. CHAIRMAN SANTIAGO I THANK YOU TO THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND TO ALL THOSE WHO ARE PRESENTED- I WOULD ONLY UNDERSCORE THE URGENCY OF THE REMARKS OF ALL THE- LEGISLATORS WHO SPOKE IN THIS MORNING. CLEARLY WE NEED IN CALIFORNIA TO HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE THEY HAVE BROADBAND AND OUR STUDENTS NEED TO HAVE ACCESS TO HIGH SPEED INTERNET NOT JUST. DURING DISTANCE LEARNING BUT WHEN IN CLASS INSTRUCTION RESUMES OUR STUDENTS SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO THE FASTEST SPEEDS OF INTERNET BECAUSE WE'RE PREPARING. THE WORKFORCE OF TOMORROW AND THIS IS WHAT THEY SHOULD HAVE AS YOU CAN IMAGINE WHEN SCHOOL RESUMES THIS YEAR. NO 7% OF OUR SCHOOLS OPENED IN DISTANCE LEARNING AND YOU KNOW I HAVE TO COMMEND. OUR EDUCATORS AND STUDENTS AND FAMILIES FOR WHAT THEY'RE DEALING WITH REPLACING THE UNTHINKABLE AND COBIT WITH FIRES AND AIR QUALITY OF SCHOOLS THAT HAVE BURNED DOWN BITTERLY LOST LOVED ONES IN HOMES. WE SEE A CREDIBLE CHALLENGES AROUND POLICE BRUTALITY RACISM. AND BIAS IN IN SO MANY OF YOU KNOW THAT IN APRIL- I CONVENE A TASK FORCE ON CLOSING. THE DIGITAL DIVIDE I ASKED SENATOR LEYVA TO CHERRY I'M GRATEFUL TO MANY OF YOU WHO WHO SERVED ON IT ASSEMBLY MEMBER SANTIAGO ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA AGUILAR CURRY ALSO YOU COLLEAGUES ASSEMBLYMEMBERS BURKE AND WOOD- I APPRECIATE YOU JOINING US. THE PANDEMIC UNCOVERED- A DIRTY LITTLE SECRET FOR CALIFORNIA AND FOR MOST OF THE NATION. THAT WE HAVE ALLOWED THE DIGITAL DIVIDE GO ON FOR FAR TOO LONG DESPITE OUR ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY INTO THE RESOURCES THAT ARE NEEDED TO SUPPORT OUR STUDENTS- BY OUR MANAGERS ARE INITIAL SURVEY SHOWED. AND CONTINUE TO SHOW THAT SOMEWHERE AROUND A MILLION STUDENTS ARE WITHOUT RESOURCES THAT THAT THEY NEED THAT CAN BE A COMPUTING DEVICE THAT IN MANY CASES THAT ACCESS. TO THE INTERNET I WANT TO THANK ALL WHO COME TOGETHER TO- PROVIDE RESOURCES AND DONATIONS- IN THE IN THE EARLY. PHASES OF DISTANCE LEARNING TO HEAR FROM DR LINDA DARLING HAMMOND OUR STATE FOR PRESIDENT AS SHE AND THE GOVERNOR AND THE FIRST PARTNER MADE THE GOVERNOR'S STAFF JOINED US AND OUR PARTNERS AT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION FOUNDATION- BEEN LITERALLY. REACHING OUT FOR DONATIONS FOR COMPUTING DEVICES IN HOT SPOT IN. IN THOSE EARLY DAYS WE SAW A LOT OF PROGRESS WE SAW SOMETHING LIKE A HUNDRED THOUSAND HOT SPOTS IN A HUNDRED THOUSAND COMPUTING DEVICES. NOT MORE LESS THE CASE AGAIN- TO SUPPORT OUR STUDENTS BUT MORE IS IT. AND IT WAS COOL. HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS WERE ACCESS AND SO WE USE THE TAP FOR LOCAL THE DIGITAL. THIS THAT WE MUST MOVE BEYOND JUST THE QUESTION. OF GETTING TO DEAL WITH THE PAIN. BUT THAT WE MUST MOVE TO A- WHERE WE CAN THE TO ONE AND FOR. AND THAT WE CAN BE THAT INTERNET. HELLO LIKE ELECTRICITY FOR ALL OF OUR STUDENTS AND FAMILIES IN THE STATE WE IMMEDIATELY CALLED UPON INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS TO COMPORT. WE ASKED THEM TO PROVIDE INTERNET TO SOME OF OUR NEEDIEST FAMILIES AND THEY DID. WE TALKED TO THEM AND LET THEM KNOW THAT WE NEED TO COMMITMENTS FROM THEM TO ENSURE THAT ANY FAMILY COULD HAVE ACCESS. TO LOW COST INTERNET IN OUR INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS THAT PROVIDED THAT IN MANY CASES THAT ABOUT TEN DOLLARS A MONTH. FOR MANY OF OUR FAMILIES WE TOLD THEM THEY HAD TO PROVIDE THIS ACCESS WITHOUT BARRIERS WITHOUT HOOPS YOU COULDN'T ASK FOR SOMEONE TO CALL SECURITY NUMBER WERE ASKING DEMOCRATIC. TO MAKE IT AVAILABLE TO THEM WITHOUT SOME GIMMICK THAT SAID GET TURNED OFF IN A MONTH OR TWO AFTER IT'S BEEN TEN DOLLARS A MONTH BUT THE PRICE WOULD RATCHET UP. IN THIS IS BEEN HELPFUL BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH IN ON TOP OF THAT WE'RE GRATEFUL TO THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR AKEL PROVIDING UP FIVE POINT TWO. MILLION DOLLARS IN- LEARNING LOSS MITIGATION FUNDS TO HELP SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO BE ABLE TO GET COMPUTING DEVICES OF. TO THE COURTS TO SUPPORT SOCIAL EMOTIONAL LEARNING NEEDS AS WELL PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR TEACHERS AND EDUCATORS I BRING THIS UP BECAUSE- IT ONE OF THE MANY THINGS THAT IS OFTEN MESS IS THAT. IN A PANDEMIC DEPRESSION FOR OUR STUDENTS DOES NOT AND THE ONLY WAY THEY CAN BE CONNECTED TO COUNSELORS AND HAVE SOCIAL EMOTIONAL SUPPORT. IT IF THEY HAVE ACCESS TO COMPUTING DEVICE IN CONNECTIVITY INTERNET FOR WORKING WITH OUR CHARACTERS AND I'VE NAMED ACCOUNTING. STAFF FORCED TO STILL GET AT ONE OF IT MAY CHALLENGES THAT WE'RE TRYING TO HELP THEM WERE THROUGH. IT CREATING CONNECTIVITY SO THEY PROVIDE HELLO. AND TELE HELP BUT TO OUR YOUNG. I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE CAN A NUMBER OF. UTILITIES COME FOR TO MAKE. DIRECT TO SERVE NEED CRISIS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES TO SERVE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN IMPACTED. BY FIRE IN WILDFIRE AND DISASTERS- WE'VE SEEN DONATIONS FROM PG&amp;E AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON. BOB TO HELP US IN THE COMMUNITIES AS WELL AS DONATIONS TO HELP. YOU COUNTY WHERE THEY'RE LITERALLY TRYING TO BUILD BACK AFTER FIRES HAVE DAMAGED SCHOOLS AND DESTROYED SO MUCH IN THE COMMUNITY- WE WANT STUFF A GO FUND ME PAGE. THAT ALLOWED CALIFORNIANS AND OTHERS TO DONATE TO HELP US PROVIDE DEVICES IN HOT SPOT TO THOSE. WHO NEED IT WHAT CLEAR BY MOST ESTIMATES IS WHAT WE NEED THE INFRASTRUCTURE. THE BILL BROADBAND BY MANY ESTIMATES A FOUR BILLION DOLLARS- IS ONE NUMBER THAT HAS BEEN KICKED AROUND BUT WHAT WE NEED IS INNOVATION. WE NEED TO GO BEYOND THE WAY THINGS HAVE BEEN. IN IN THOSE RESPECTS ARE EXCITED TO BE MAKING SOME ANNOUNCEMENTS IN THE DAYS AND WEEKS TO COME. ABOUT AN INNOVATION COMPETITION- THAT WE ARE WORKING ON TO ROLL OUT I WANT TO THANK DR GARY MICHELSON WHO WAS AN INNOVATOR AND ENTREPRENEUR. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- THE PROTESTS OUT TO WORK WITHOUT TWENTY INNOVATION COMPETITION. TO CREATE THE NEXT GREAT SOLUTION IN ADDRESSING THE LACK OF BROADBAND IN ADDRESSING INFRASTRUCTURE THAT COULD BE SATELLITE THAT COULD BE ANY OF THE SOLUTIONS THAT WE HEARD TALK ABOUT. BUT CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO LEAD THIS NATION AND HOW WE CLOSE THE BROADBAND GAP UNTIL YOU HEAR MORE ABOUT OUR INNOVATION COMPETITION. THANK YOU DR MICHAEL SAID THE FOUNDATION. FOR THE INVESTMENT THAT YOU'RE MAKING AND FOR SAYING WITH URGENCY THAT WE SHOULD ONCE AND FOR ALL SO ALL. THE DIGITAL DIVIDE FOR CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. AND WE SUBMIT. THAT THIS TIME IN THE FORTY ANY QUESTIONS. FROM THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SILVER AND THURMAN WE WILL NOW HEAR FOR THE DA LINDA. HAMMOND SHE PRESS. OF THE- STATE BOARD OF ED. AND SHE IS JOINING VIA VIDEO FROM PALO ALTO. DR LINDA DARLING HAMMOND. I SEE AN EMPTY CHAIR. I SEE. HELLO THERE SHE IS. HE LOOKS HAPPY RECEIVE AN READY ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M GLAD THAT THE TECHNOLOGY IS WORKING. SURE ENOUGH DONALD CHAIRMAN SANTIAGO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR INVITING EVEN PART OF THIS IMPORTANT HEARING ON DIGITAL DIVIDE AND HOW WE FINALLY CLOSED FOR GOOD. TELL ME TO TAKE ON AN ACCOMPLISHED. AS EVERYONE HAS SAID RAPIDLY I SUBMITTED A RISK WRITTEN REMARKS THAT OFFERED MORE DETAILS ABOUT WHAT I WILL BRIEFLY SUMMARIZE AND THESE NEXT COUPLE OF MINUTES- A FEW POINTS. WE'VE COME A LONG WAY IN CALIFORNIA IN TERMS OF FIGURING OUT HOW TO PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY DISTANCE LEARNING AND BEING READY TO DO SO- ACCORDING TO ONE ESTIMATE AT THE START OF THE PANDEMIC WE WERE RANKED SECOND IN THE NATURE. NATION FOR THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF STUDENTS AND TEACHERS LACKING ADEQUATE ACCESS AND DEVICES AT HOME ONE POINT FIVE MILLION STUDENTS ESTIMATED. TO LACK HIGH SPEED INTERNET CONNECTION. BUT 25% OF OUR TOTAL AND JUST OVER A MILLION MORE ESTIMATED SELECT DEVICES WE ALSO HAD BUT 8% OF OUR TEACHERS. BACK IN HIGH SPEED CONNECTIONS. AND DEVICES ACCORDING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ABOUT THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS STILL LACK ADEQUATE INTERNET FROM THE SURVEYS THEY'VE BEEN CONDUCTING. A WHICH IS A MOUNTAIN TO CLIMB BUT A SMALLER ONE THAT WE HAD JUST SIX MONTHS AGO. AND ITS WORST RECENTLY JUST THIS PAST MONTH ESTIMATED THAT ABOUT 11% OF PARENTS SAID UNRELIABLE INTERNET IS A MAJOR PROBLEM. THERE ARE. STILL SUPPLY CHAIN PROBLEMS IN GETTING DEVICES TO STUDENTS- EVEN WITH THE RECENT GENEROUS OFFERING OF A MILLION IPADS WITH FLYING CITING CONNECTIONS ARE BUILT INTO THEM A LOT GETTING THOSE TO THE SCHOOLS IS GOING TO TAKE A FEW MONTHS AS WE GET THROUGH THE SUPPLY CHAIN BUT AT THIS POINT MOST OF THE PROBLEM HAS TO DO WITH INTERNET ACCESS COSTS AND AVAILABILITY- MANY MANY OF ARTISTS INCLUDING OUR LARGEST ONCE LOS ANGELES SAN DIEGO LONG BEACH OTHERS OPEN DOORS THIS FALL WITH A GET COMPUTERS DEVICES- AND HOT SPOTS. BUT THERE ARE ISSUES OF AFFORDABILITY AT TIMES- WHEN PEOPLE ARE LOSING THEIR JOBS AND LIVELIHOOD SOMETIMES THEY CAN'T EVEN AFFORD ELECTRICITY WE HAVE A HOMELESSNESS THAT'S GROWING WE HAVE LOW RATES INTERNET OFFERS THAT WE'RE GOOD FOR THIRTY OR SIXTY DAYS A SUPERINTENDENT BERMAN NOTED THAT BECAME UNAFFORDABLE AFTER THAT PERIOD OF TIME WE HAVE PROBLEMS WITH BANDWIDTH THAT'S NOT ADEQUATE TO SUPPORT THE TASKS ASSOCIATED WITH SCHOOL WORK ONLINE AND INADEQUATE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR HIGH SPEED INTERNET ESPECIALLY IN RURAL COMMUNITIES- WE'VE ALREADY HEARD ABOUT THE MANY STORIES THAT WERE. WIDESPREAD IN THE SPRING OF ABOUT CHILDREN HAVING A PROBLEMS WITH SHARING YOU KNOW ONE HOT SPOT AMONG FIVE SIBLINGS A LOW BAND OF PROBLEMS EVEN TEACHERS AND PRINCIPALS TRYING TO TEACH OUR FROM A HOT SPOT ON THEIR CELL. PHONE AND I STAYED IN LOCAL. HAVE A TRUST MANY OF THESE PER. FOR ME STOOD. OF THE STATE AS- BERMAN ALLOCATED FIVE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS THAN TWO AS MUCH AS CAROUSEL REQUIRED TO GO TO UP TO. PER IN HIGH NEED. SURE THESE. THE BRIDGE AND THE JUDGE TOLD FUND THERE WAS MENTIONED HAS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DEVICES AND HOT SPOTS TO COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE- THE STATE'S LARGEST DISTRICTS AS I NOTED AND MANY OF ITS SMALL RURAL DISTRICTS OPENED THE DOORS THIS FALL WITH ENOUGH. DEVICES AND HOT SPOTS FOR EVERY STUDENT- WE HAVE INSTRUCTIONAL CONTINUITY PLANS IN PLACE THE LEGISLATURE BOB PUT A FRAMEWORK AROUND WHAT. STUDENTS SHOULD EXPECT AND WHAT DISTRICTS ARE PROVIDE IN TERMS OF BOTH A PLANS FOR CURRICULUM OF FOR IN AND OUT OF SCHOOL AND THOSE DEVICES NEEDED- HOWEVER- THE ISSUE OF ACCESS TO RELIABLE INTERNET GOES BEYOND THE LIST NEEDS FOR DEVICES AND HOT SPOTS EVEN WITH THESE TOOLS IN PLACE- AS WE'VE- NOTED FAMILIES LIVE IN REGIONS WHERE ACCESS. ISN'T AN OPTION DUE TO THE LACK OF BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE PARTICULARLY IN RURAL AREAS BUT THERE ARE SOME OF THESE CHALLENGES. IN CITIES AS WELL- AND SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU KNOW IF YOU GO TO RURAL PLUMAS COUNTY MANY EDUCATORS LIKE INTERNET IN THEIR HOMES AND HAVE TO USE. THEIR OWN CELLPHONES MANY STUDENTS LIKE. INTERNET CONNECTIONS AND ALL UNIFIED JUST EVEN THOUGH. HAS BEEN. UP FOR DEVICE STUDENTS OFTEN COME TO THE SCHOOL LOT. IN ORDER TO GET INTERNET SHOULD THE WORK BUT THEY'RE TRY TO DO. DISTRICTS ARE TRYING TO ADDRESS THE VERY WOULD LIKE UNIFIED SPENT A MILLION DOLLARS PUT UP TO EXPAND INTERNET. BEYOND THE SCHOOL. ASSEMBLY THIS IS A PLAN AB AND C. OKAY GIVEN THE NEW LIFE AND INTERNET SIR TO EVERY STUDENT BUT- BECAUSE OF THE EMERALD. OF SERVICE. IT Y. PRICE. FAILS KNOW THE BIG INTO THE CLASS TO TALK THE TEACHER. THEY HAVE PACK FROM UP WEEK STAFF MEANS TO OUT HOW TO THE STUDENTS OR NOT ENGAGED INCLUDING MAKE SOCIAL. HOUSE CALLS. THE STATE HAS A PROVIDE GUY FOR SAFE FOR SMALL OF STE. I FORCED IN L. SCHOOLS ON. SCHOOL WAIVERS IN PARTS OF THE STATE THAT ARE NOT ABLE TO BE OPEN BECAUSE OF. INFECTION RATES- BUT WE DO NEED TO SOLVE MY PROBLEM AND I WILL NOTE. THAT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INFECTION RATES IN COMMUNITIES AND SCHOOL OPENINGS IS WELL DOCUMENTED AROUND THE WORLD WE SAW THAT WITH OUTBREAKS IN ISRAEL AND SOUTH AFRICA AND FRANCE WE'VE SEEN IT MORE RECENTLY WITHOUT GRAYSON GEORGIA TEXAS AND FLORIDA. IN NEW YORK CITY SCHOOLS OPENED. A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO AND- ABOUT A WEEK AND A HALF LATER HUNDRED SCHOOLS HAD TO BE CLOSED. BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT. THERE WERE OUTBREAKS THAT. WERE GROWING. IN CONTEXT THE SCHOOLS ARE AT THAT POINT IN TIME SO WE ARE TO HAVE DEAL WITH THIS FOR A WHILE WE NEED TO SOLVE. INTERNET ACCESS PROBLEM IN ORDER TO DO THAT ULTIMATELY FEDERAL REGULATION AND INVESTMENT ALONG WITH CONTINUED STRAIGHT EFFORTS WILL BE NEEDED TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM. THE INTERNET IS TODAY WHAT THE TELEPHONE WAS IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES WHEN THE NATION DECIDED THAT INCENTIVES AND SUPPORTS WHERE NEEDED. TO ENSURE THAT EVERY HOME COULD GET ACCESS. TO AND AFFORD A TELEPHONE. CALIFORNIA'S BOTTLES FOR EXPANDING BROADBAND ACCESS TO PROVIDE DIRECT PARALLELS TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF RURAL TELEPHONE LINES. CALIFORNIA HIGH COST AND BE FUNDS ADMINISTERED BY THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION WE HAVE MADE SOME HEADWAY HOWEVER- WE HAVE. JUST ABOUT AND IT'S THOSE LAST MILES IT'S THAT YOU'RE REACHING THOSE PARTS OF THE STATE THAT I HAVE THE GREATEST NEEDS THAT ARE GOING TO OUR TENSION- AS A LEARNING STATE WE HAVE BENEFITTED AND CAN CONTINUE TO BENEFIT FROM EXAMINING THE STRATEGIES THAT OTHERS WHO ARE WORKING TO CLOSE. THE DIGITAL DIVIDE HAVE ATTEMPTED AND IN MY WRITTEN TESTIMONY OF OFFERED EXAMPLES FROM A NUMBER OF STATES THAT HAVE INNOVATED IN THIS AREA- IN CASE ANY OF THOSE- STRATEGIES PROVE USEFUL HERE THOSE HAVE INCLUDED USING FEDERAL FUNDING AND WE MAY SEE ANOTHER RECOVERY ACT IF NOT NOW. IN JANUARY OR FEBRUARY OF THAT WILL PROVIDE SOME RESOURCES FOR ONGOING ISSUES OF CONNECTIVITY- WE CAN USE OTHERS TO EXPAND BROADBAND ROLLED VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES OF WE SEE A LOT OF STATES THAT ARE DEVELOPING RESULTS MAPS THAT SHOW ACCESS AND SPEEDS ACROSS THE STATE IN VARIOUS COMMUNITIES AND USE THOSE AS THE BASIS FOR. A DETERMINING GRANTS AND OTHER STEPS THAT CAN BE TAKEN- AND TO PRIORITIZE OF THE NEEDS WHERE THEY ARE GREATEST MANY STATES HAVE RURAL COOPERATIVES OF THIS IS VERY COMMON IN THE MIDWEST- THAT HAVE MANAGED TO XP. BROADBAND IN PLACE THAT WOULD NOT ALL. I HAVE BEEN I TRUST. OBVIOUSLY PARTNERS WITH MANY. CORPORATIONS I HE RATE ACTION ARE AMONG THE STRAY THAT ARE. WE HAVE MADE. VERY SUBSTANTIAL STRIDES TOWARD CLOSE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. IN TERMS OF WHAT CAN BE DONE WITH IT NOT EASILY BUT WITH WHAT SOME EFFORT UP WITH TO BUY AND HOT SPOTS AND EXPANDING ACCESS TO PROGRAM SO THAT IS FREELY AVAILABLE LIKE A PUBLIC UTILITY. I WATER LIKE TELL LIKE A LOT IS THE STATE THE COUNTRY FINDS AND THAT CALIFORNIA FINDS ITSELF. AS WE CONTINUE TO ASSESS HOW THE PANDA IS IMPACTING EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY FOR STUDENTS- WE WILL CONTINUE TO SEEK TO LEARN FROM OUR OWN EXPERIENCES AND FROM THOSE OF OTHER STATES TO THE GREATEST EXTENT WE CAN THANK YOU. THANK YOU A DR LINDA DARLING HAMMOND OF YOUR COMMENTS ALL OF PRESENTERS FOR THE COMETS WILL NOT- GO TO QUESTIONS FOR THE PANEL YOU KNOW JUST START OFF WITH ONE- FOR DR LINDA DARLING HAMMOND. IS THERE ONE STATE. THAT IS DOING THIS IGHT IN OTHER WORDS THEY'VE GOT THIS MOSTLY SOLVE FOR BLOCK OF ANY WAY OF PUTTING IT WHO MIGHT- WE LOOK TO AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO TACKLE THIS PROBLEM AGAIN THE QUESTION IS THERE ONE STATE. THAT REALLY HAS A GOOD GRASP ON THIS ISSUE. THERE ARE STATES THAT HAVE BEEN A LOT OF HEADWAY BUT CALIFORNIA IS MUCH BIGGER AND MORE DIVERSE GEOGRAPHICALLY AND DEMOGRAPHICALLY THAN THAN OTHER STATES. SO YOU KNOW YOU COULD LOOK TO WYOMING WHICH STARTED ON THIS AGENDA. YOU KNOW MANY YEARS AGO IT WAS KIND OF LIKE THIS STUFF TOP STATE THE NATION FOR GETTING ACCESS TO RURAL BROADBAND. I YOU CAN LOOK TO SOME OF THE EFFORTS THAT ARE GOING ON IN. PLACES LIKE- KENTUCKY AND MAINE. I THINK OUR- ARE. MORE SUBSTANTIAL THE SIZE OF OUR STATE AND THOUGHT DEMOGRAPHY OUR STATE AND OUR- A GEOGRAPHY WITH A BOUND AND- OTHER. TO DEAL WITH BUT THERE ARE SOME STRATEGIES THAT WE CAN LOOK TO OTHER STATES. HARPER WHO DO HAVE WHITES IS OF TERRITORY. A LOT OF RULES REIN TO COVER THAT COULD BE POTENTIALLY- INFORMATIVE TO US. THANK YOU ARE THERE QUESTIONS FOR MANY OF THE MEMBERS HERE FOR. MISTER SMITH. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I HAVE A QUESTION FOR MR CABRAL FROM THE LA OFFICE- YOU KNOW WHAT WE UNDERSTAND THAT WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS IT IS A TWO PART PROBLEM WE HAVE THE IMMEDIATE CHALLENGE OF ADDRESSING- WHAT HAPPENS IN THIS CRISIS AND MAKING SURE THAT WE GET EVERY STUDENT WE POSSIBLY CAN'T UP TO SPEED WITH TECHNOLOGY AND EQUIPMENT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE INTO THE COMMENTS FROM LINDA DARLING HAMMOND IN OUR SUPERINTENDENT WE KNOW THAT ON MANY FRONTS WE HAVE WORKED DILIGENTLY TO SOLVE THAT IMMEDIATE ISSUE. BUT IN THE LONG TERM WE KNOW THAT THIS IS AN ONGOING PIECE OF CALIFORNIA'S EDUCATION PROCESS AND OF OUR STATE STANDARDS SO AT ANY POINT IN ITS ASSESSMENT HAS THE L. A. CALCULATED WHAT IT WOULD COST ON AN ANNUAL PER PUPIL BASIS TO SUPPORT THE TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION STANDARDS FOR EVERY STUDENT IN CALIFORNIA FROM K. THROUGH TWELVE INCLUDING INTERNET ACCESS SOFTWARE LICENSING. AND HARDWARE. THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE'VE THAT WE'VE I CALCULATED BEFORE I THINK THAT. WILL BE A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT WE NEED TO LOOK INTO THAT MAKE SURE WHAT WHAT- WHAT EXACTLY THAT WOULD ENTAIL- I GET ONE OF THE IMPORTANT THAT YOU'RE MENTIONING. WHAT ARE THE EXPECTATIONS OF THE HOME IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NOW. BUT SITUATION MORE LONGER TERM IN THE FUTURE WHEN WE'RE NOT. DOING DISTANCE LEARNING AS A AS AN ENTIRE STATE ESSENTIALLY. ARGUED THAT WOULD NEED TO BE SOME CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT EXACTLY WILL SENATOR PLACE BUT- NO WE HAVE NOT DONE ANYTHING SPECIFIC WHERE TO GAVE IT WOULD. REQUIRE A LOT OF KIND MAJOR DECISION POINTS TO FIGURE OUT IF. A BALLPARK ESTIMATE OF ANYTHING. THANK YOU. MISS AGUIAR-CURRY. THANK YOU THIS IS I THINK THE L. A. O. AS WELL- YOU MENTIONED THAT A LOT PER OF HOUSE HAVE AN TO BROUGH. DO YOU HAVE ANY DATA ON HOW MANY HOUSEHOLDS ARE EQUIPPED WITH SPEEDS ADEQUATE FOR MULTIPLE CHILDREN DISTANCE LEARNING AND DO YOU HAVE ANY SPECIFIC DATE DATA OUTLINING THE CHALLENGES OF STUDENTS WHO ARE DISTANCE LEARNING IN RURAL CALIFORNIA- WE'RE FINDING THE CONVERSATIONS I'M HAVING IN MY DISTRICT IS THAT NOT ONE FAMILY CAN ALL BE ONLINE AT ONE TIME WITH TEMPORARY HOT SPOTS AND SO- I JUST WAS ALSO DO YOU HAVE A PERCENT OF STUDENTS THAT ARE ACTUALLY RELYING ON TEMPORARY HOT SPOTS FOR DISTANCE LEARNING. THANK YOU. SO WHAT WE DON'T HAVE THAT SPECIFIC DATA THAT THE GAP ANALYSIS THAT I MENTIONED THAT THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION DID. I WAS LOOKING AT. ACCESS OR ADOPTION RATES AND USAGE IN IN HOUSEHOLDS CHRISTIANS IN EMMAUS HOLD. USING THE LOWER SIX MEGABIT PER SECOND STANDARD I THINK UNDER THAT STANDARD I THINK IT'S PROBABLY ONLY ONE STUDENT COULD BE DEFIED DOING DISTANCE LEARNING AT ONE TIME SO IF YOU HAVE A TWO OR THREE CHILDREN. ARE TRYING TO ACCESS A ONE TIME THAT'S NOT TELLING YOU ENOUGH I DON'T THE INFORMATION EVERYTHING FROM THEM. ARE HAD SOME STATEWIDE NUMBERS I DON'T KNOW TO WHAT EXTENT THEY HAD INFORMATION- ARE EASILY AVAILABLE THAT THAT BREAKS DOWN INDIVIDUAL R. OR RISK REGIONAL- VARIATION. ARE WE DO KNOW THE BASED ON THE- INFORMATION OF THE OTHER THAT WE WOULD EXPECT THAT THERE WOULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY- BIGGER CHALLENGES IN. LOWER INCOME AREAS IN ERIC AND- SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER ADOPTION AND- HOUSEHOLDS THAT HAVE LIMITED ENGLISH THAT HAVE LIMITED ENGLISH SPEAKING ADULTS- AND I THINK BASED ON WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT BROADBAND ACCESS IN. RURAL AREAS THERE'S ALREADY JUST ONE THIRD OF. ONE THIRD OF RURAL HOUSEHOLDS EVEN IF THEY- JOSEPH EVEN IF THEY WANTED SUBSCRIBE ALL OF THEM CHOICES. TO THE BROADER ACCESS TO BE ACCESS TO. THERE'S A LOT THIRD OF HOUSE WHO DO NOT HAVE. SUFFICIENT ACCESSIBLE TO STUDENTS ON AT ONE TIME. THANK YOU MISTER RODRIGUEZ. YEAH BUT YOU CHARGE MORE OF A COMMENT AND THEN A QUESTION ON THANK ALL THE PANELISTS FOR BEING HERE THIS MORNING TO TALK ABOUT THIS VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE I JUST WANT TO REITERATE. ON OUR- SUPERINTENDENT- MISTER THURMAN. FOR HIS WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT INTERNET NOT JUST INTERNET INTERNET BUT HIGH SPEED INTERNET. AND I LIKE HIS COOPER SAYS. IT MUST FLOOR LIKE ELECTRICITY I THINK WE'RE JUST BEEN A LOT OF WORK DONE. BUT OFFICER FROM OVER HERE NOW THERE'S A LOT MORE WORK IN FRONT OF US. I LIKE THAT WE NEED TO BE CREATIVE IN FINDING. SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM I KNOW YOU TALKED ABOUT- PUTTING SOME FOLKS. TO A TEST TO SEE HOW WE CAN. CLOSE THAT GAP I THINK NOW MORE THAN EVER. WE ALL NEED TO COME TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY STUDENT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. HAS ACCESS TO HIGH SPEED INTERNET. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHERE IN THE INNER CITY. IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY ON THE ROLE COMMUNITIES MORE THAN EVER WE NEED IT. AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN START MOVING FOR TO CLOSE THAT GAP. SOONER RATHER THAN LATER THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR STATE MINISTER RODRIGUEZ MISTER KALRA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU TO THE OF PRESENTERS I THINK THAT AS MANY MY COLLEAGUES AND EVEN THE PRESENTATIONS INDICATE- YOU KNOW THAT THIS. REPRESENTS INEQUITIES AS COVERT HAS DONE THAT HAVE BEEN LOGGING SO LONG EXISTING- IN OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM. AND IT'S IS ABSOLUTELY IN THE SHORT TERM ABOUT HAVING ADEQUATE INFRASTRUCTURE AND TECHNOLOGY TO ALL STUDENTS FOR DISTANCE LEARNING BUT EVEN POST PANDEMIC I THINK THAT- THE LACK OF ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY DISADVANTAGES SO MANY STUDENTS. AND HAS INDICATED- IN URBAN AREAS- JUST AS MUCH AS A RURAL COMMUNITIES AND SPEED IS AN ISSUE IN BOTH PUBLICLY RURAL COMMUNITIES BUT EVEN AS IN THE CASE THAT YOU HAVE MULTIPLE LEARNERS AND US AND- HOUSEHOLD THE SPEEDERS. HAVE BROWN AND I HAD A ME WITH. OUR COUNTY. OF SCHOOLS A SUNBURST BOARD AND AREA AND- I THINK THAT THE- ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT ARISES. IS THE FACT THAT THERE CERTAINLY ARE SO MANY DISTRICTS OF SO MANY COMPANIES YEAH THE GOVERNMENT YOU HAVE THE STATE YET- THE DISTRICTS AND IF THERE'S NOT A UNIFORM SYSTEM I THINK THIS SPEAKS. TO THE QUESTION FROM THE SUMMER SMITH AND SOME OF THE COMMENTS MADE A OF THAT- REALLY THE IT IS BECOMING UTILITY THAT THEY NEED TO HAVE NOT JUST INTERNET ACCESS BUT HIGH SPEED ESPECIALLY FOR CHILDREN AND SO IN ADDITION TO WHAT THE COST WOULD BE. WHAT OF WHAT WOULD BE THE NECESSARY MAJESTIC'S TO CREATE A UNIFORM SYSTEM WORSE PARENTS STUDENTS ONLY THE HARAPPAN ORDER ONE- PLATFORM ONE PLACE TO GO- THAT IS IDEALLY EITHER STATE RUNNER LEAST COORDINATED WITH THE STATE BECAUSE WHAT I'M HEARING IS THAT IT'S JUST TOO CONFUSING AND TOO MANY STUDENTS ARE BEING LEFT OUT THE ONES THAT KNOW. THE PROGRAMS EXIST ARE GOING TO GO TO THE PROGRAMS AS THE ONES THAT DON'T KNOW THE FAMILIES I DON'T KNOW- THAT ARE THE ONES THAT ARE HARDER TO REACH ESPECIALLY BY ON THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES BECAUSE THEY DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW WHERE THEY AE EITHER AND SO YOU KNOW ANY COMMENT ON THAT OR YOU KNOW JUST YOU CAN ACCEPT A COMMON AND WE CAN- OF MOBILE FOLLOW UP LATER. BUT I THINK THAT IT'S ABOUT THE MONEY BUT IT'S ALSO ABOUT THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND HAVING ONE PLACE TO GO TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR FAMILIES AND STUDENTS ARE NOT HAVING THEM TO HAVE TO GO TO TWO THREE FOUR FIVE DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS COMPANIES AND WHAT HAVE YOU- BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THE INEQUITIES ARE. JUST ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS CORK SILVA. THANK YOU THIS IS. THIS QUESTION IS FOR LINDA DARLING HAMMOND AND- I WANTED TO SAY A FEW THINGS BEFORE I ASKED QUESTION BUT AS SHE WAS THE NOTING IS YOU KNOW YOU NOT ONLY HAVE THE RURAL CONNECTION- JUST WITH SAID YOU ALSO HAVE AN INNER CITY CONNECTION ISSUES FAMILY ISSUES BUT ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAVEN'T ADDRESSED TODAY IT ISN'T JUST OUR CHILDREN THAT ARE HAVING ISSUES IT'S ALSO OUR WORKERS AND EMPLOYEES MANY EMPLOYEES- NOT ONLY WERE ASKED BUT- BUT HAD TO MAKE A CHOICE TO WORK REMOTELY SO THEY HAVE THOSE VERY SAME ISSUE. BUT WE ALSO HAVE SOME CITIES ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT AS I MENTIONED MY EARLIER COMMENTS INVESTED AND WERE ABLE TO BRING SOME OF THAT BROADBAND THROUGH A CITY SCHOOL DISTRICT PARTNERSHIPS- WE CAN CLEARLY SEE THAT NOT ALL HAVE DONE THAT BUT NOW WHEN YOU LOOK AT ADULT WORKERS WORKING REMOTELY FOR A LOOK AT OUR STUDENTS THAT NEED TO HAVE ACCESS AND CITIES THAT NEED TO PARTICIPATE. THIS DEFINITELY COULD BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PARTNERSHIPS THAT UP WHETHER THEY'RE STRONGLY ENCOURAGED WHETHER- THERE'S NO OTHER ALTERNATIVE BUT PEOPLE TO JOIN FORCES AS FAR AS FUNDING SO MY QUESTION TO. MISS HAMMOND IS RIGHT NOW WE'RE SEEING MODELS OF SOME STUDENTS RETURNING AND A HYBRID MODEL- MATTER OF FACT MY HUSBAND TEACHES JUNIOR HIGH JUST STARTED YESTERDAY WITH STUDENTS IN THE CLASS BUT ALSO DOING DISTANCE LEARNING NOW THEM THE SCHOOLS THAT OPEN SHE MENTIONED THAT THERE WERE OUTBREAKS AND HAD TO CLOSE- THAT TO ME SOUNDS LIKE THEY'RE THAT WITH EVERYBODY JOINING WERE COMING TO SCHOOL AT ONE. AT DOES SHE HAVE ANY EXAMPLES AND IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE JUST IN CALIFORNIA OF WHERE THE HYBRID MODEL KIND OF- ADDING STUDENTS LITTLE BY LITTLE IS WORKING AND IF SHE DOES WHAT WHAT'S THE RESPONSE AND SHE'S BACK ON. I HEAR I DON'T KNOW. YEAH YOU KNOW MY HAIR YES. OKAY BOB YEAH THERE ARE PLACES WHERE THE HIGH MODEL WORKING AND WE'RE IN CLASS WITH EVERYONE IS THOSE ARE PLAY WHERE THE IN FACT RATES LOW AND WHERE EVERYONE IN THE SCHOOL IS FOLLOWING ALL THE RULES YOU KNOW EVERYONE'S USING FACE COVERINGS SANITATION HAND WASHING. YEAH DEVELOPED FEDERATION SYSTEM AND WHY THAT WERE. AND ARE ATTENTION TO FISCAL DISINCENTIVES SO THEIR NUMBER OF PLACES- MANY ON THE EAST COAST WHERE YOU CAN SEE- SCHOOLS IN OPERATING. IN WAYS THAT ARE WORKING AND WHERE USE THAT USE THE HYBRID MODEL IN CLASS PART OF THE TIME IT AT HOME AND SEVEN PART OF SOMETIMES GET CLEANING TIME DISINFECTING TIME IN BETWEEN THE- BATCHES OF STUDENTS AS WELL AS TO ALLOW. FOR THE PHYSICAL JUST. A LOT SHE IS DO THOSE STRATEGIES SAYS CAL. HAS TRYING TO CREATE A FOR. A THOUGHTFULLY I PLACE IN FACT RATES ARE OVER. LOW AND WHERE YOU CAN DO THAT WITH STRONG COHORT IN SOMEONE SOMETHING IF I AYE CASE DOES COME UP YOU CAN IMMEDIATELY ATTEND TO IT. YOU KNOW SEND A SMALL NUMBER OF FOLKS. TO QUARANTINE. TO BE SURE THAT YOU KNOW WHEN YOU GOING TO SPUR ANY OF. AND SO ON UP MY ABOUT WHERE IT'S BEEN SAFE AND- PLACES WHERE INSPECTION ARE. IT ALSO IN SOME CASES WHERE. PEOPLE HAVE FOLLOWED ALL THE RULES. EVEN WITH THE SIGN ACTION THEN THE YOU HAVE TO BE MUCH CUTS AND WE CAN'T GET OVER THE DIVIDE ABOUT THESE PROBLEMS WITH DISTANCE LEARNING. HELLO BY JUST EVERYONE BACK TO SCHOOL WE'VE GOT TO DO IS SAFELY AND YOU KNOW CARE FOR WAYS LIKE YOU'RE DISTRICT IS TAKING ALL OF THE- A CONCERN INTO ACCOUNT AND- HOPEFULLY WILL HAVE A SIX. EXPERIENCE. THANK OUR NEXT QUESTION IS FOR MR GARCIA THANK YOU TAKE CARE IN THE QUESTION WOULD BE FOR PRESIDENT THAT DARLING HAMMOND OR SUPERINTENDENT. RECONSTRUCTION IN THE BEST PRACTICES OUTSIDE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAVE YOU SEEN. WHERE PERHAPS IT'S THE LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES- HAVING THE ABILITY TO DELIVER THE INTERNET- SERVICES- TO THE STUDENTS FOR EXAMPLE I'VE BEEN READING A LOT ABOUT- SHOWN WITH TENNESSEE MUNICIPAL INTERNET DISTRICT THAT'S- BEEN ABLE TO CONNECT OVER THIRTY TWO. THOUSAND STUDENTS TO HIGH SPEED INTERNET AND ROUTERS. AND DEVICES AND SO AS YOU MENTIONED YOU KNOW THERE ARE PLACES WHERE THEY'VE DONE IT RIGHT- I KNOW THAT FOR US THAT ME. NEED SOME PUBLIC POLICY REFORM ABLE TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT HERE BUT I'M WONDERING. IF THAT IS SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE SEEN HAPPENING OUTSIDE. AT AND FOR US TO CONSIDER WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S A DIRECTION THAT WE NEED TO GO IN. FOR PURPOSES OF- BE MORE EFFECTIVE AND I AND I PUT THAT ON THE TABLE GIVEN THAT IN SOME PLACES IN CALIFORNIA I REPRESENT RIVERSIDE COUNTY PRO COUNTY. THE AFFECTION INFECTION RATES ARE NOT GOING TO. AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT GOING INTO. A DIFFERENT PHASE OF- THE METRICS THAT HAVE BEEN SAVED SET BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND SO THAT MEANS THAT WE MAY BE IN. LOCKDOWN MODE- FOR LONGER PERIODS OF TIME AND THAT'S UNFORTUNATE BUT THAT MEANS THAT OUR CHILDREN WILL REMAIN. IN THIS DISTANCE LEARNING. SITUATION YET CONNECTIVITY REMAINS A PROBLEM SPEED REMAINS A PROBLEM. AND ULTIMATELY- CONTINUING TO SEE A GAP. IN THE LEARNING CAPACITIES OF OUR CHILDREN AND SO. I'M WONDERING IF YOU HAVE SOME EXAMPLES WHETHER THE LEAD TO THE CHATTANOOGA. EXAMPLE AND IF SO IS THAT SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT AS A PUBLIC POLICY REFORM. AS WE'RE LOOKING AT PUSHING- YOU KNOW LEGISLATION TO. BE MORE INTENTIONAL WITH OUR EFFORTS. A QUESTION FOR YOU MATTER PRESIDENT OR SUPERINTENDENT OF INSTRUCTION IF I AM SCREEN ALMOST. AND THEN MAYBE SUPPORT THEIR MOBILE. YEAH RIGHT AFTER. I THERE ARE A LOT OF USEFUL EFFORTS THERE ON IF I CHANNEL JUST READ. I THINK HUNDRED SPOTS ON STREET LAMP POLES ALSO THAT THEY ARE FREE BROADBAND TO NEIGHBORHOODS YOU KNOW SEPARATE HAS WORKED IN THAT WAY. EARLIER HEROES AT COULD TO. THAT KIND OF- ACCESS IN MANY COMMUNITIES THERE'S A REPORT THAT CAME OUT JUST TODAY IT WAS PUBLISHED BY A GROUP CALLED CHIEFS FOR CHANGE THEY ARE HEADS OF URBAN SCHOOLS SYSTEMS AND STATES- WITH- WHOLE SLEW OF EXAMPLES OF WAYS BY WHICH CITIES HAVE- TAKEN THE BULL BY THE HORNS AS A WORK AND CREATED INNOVATIVE STRATEGIES TO BE SURE THAT. HIGH SPEED INTERNET IS MORE WIDELY AVAILABLE- TYPICALLY AT NO CHARGE WORK VERY LITTLE CHARGE TO- RESIDENTS SO THERE IS THERE IS A SET OF- STRATEGIES AND I CAN BE SURE ABOUT THAT REPORT GET SOME GUIDANCE TO THE- COMMITTEE IF IT'S NOT READILY AVAILABLE. AND HERE THERE WILL BE CONTINUING- FEDERAL FUNDING- I AM QUITE SURE THERE'S A LOT GOING ON HELL RIGHT NOW THAT WILL PROVIDE SOME CHRISTIAN FOR SOME OF THOSE KINDS OF INNOVATIONS BOTH AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. AND AT THE STATE LEVEL. JUST DON'T TURN IT BACK YOU TO OUR CARLY HAMMOND I WOULD JUST UP WHERE YOU WERE YOU LEFT OFF WHO ESTIMATE AMERICA YET WE HAVE SEEN. PLEASE ACROSS THE COUNTRY ANY CAL. OKAY LEAD TO BE CREATE. UP WITH ALL SEEN DISTRICTS MOVEMENT TO. THE WORK OF BECOME INTERNET SIR BUT- IT USED. ATIONS BECKHAM'S BAKER ALLOWS. THE ABILITY ACTION BECOME THEIR OWN AYE IT HE- MAY HEAR THE FROM PRETTY IN COUNTY BUT KNOW THAT OTHER CAN. LITERALLY HAVE BEEN IN THE TECHNOLOGY BECOME THEIR OWN I P. THEY CURRENT GET WITH THE NEEDED. FROM TRADITIONAL I'D MANY OF WHOM WEREN'T WILLING TO MAKE IN. BECAUSE THE POPULATION JUST WHAT A GREAT ENOUGH FOR THE PROFIT GET THE GET A POINT. UP WE'VE ALSO. THAT ANY CITY FOR CARE THEY'VE ME GETTING DEVICE FOR THAT. WORK WITH WITH APPLE YOU CAME UP WITH A WAY TO GET A LITTLE DEVICE THAT ALREADY A IN A WE UP ON THAT IN WE WERE ABLE TO WORK CLOSELY WITH APPLE T. MOBILE. AND THEY CREATED A INTERNET ENABLE I. THAT WOULD LOW COST THAT WOULD. WORK THE OPERATE SYSTEM THAT SCHOOL THIS AND CAL. WILL BE. IT BECAME IN COURT BECAUSE THAT YOU KNOW THE BIGGEST IN OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE FOR NOW. IF THEY CANNOT GET SUPPLY BACK ENOUGH ALL SUPPLY COME BACK. SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE STILL WAITING TO GET DEVICES EIGHTY THAT MADE COME IN UNTIL AS LATE AS DECEMBER AND SO THE OFFER THAT. AND THAT I APPLE MADE WITH MOBILE GAVE US IN OUR TO STAY TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS WE HAVE TO PULL THEM. WE SET UP GOT YOU'VE GOT MY FROM THE LETTER LAW COMMITTEE FONG THERE'S NOT MUCH SUPPLY AVAILABLE UNTIL APPLE IN T. MOBILE CAME TOGETHER IN A WAY THAT THAT MAY. BE SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN USE ACROSS ANY PLATFORM ANY OPERATING SYSTEM THAT MEANT UP TO ANOTHER MILLION OR SO DEVICES YEAH I STATUS FIGURE OUT WAYS TO. THE SOURCE MATERIAL- NUMERI NINETEEN OUR OFFICE MANY OF YOU BETTER DO THE TASK FORCE SHE LITERALLY HAD FIGURED OUT A WAY TO GET MANUFACTURERS TO HOLD ON TO DEVICES FOR CALIFORNIA SCHOOL DISTRICT AND SO WE'VE SEEN INNOVATION- IN OAKLAND AND SAN FRANCISCO- THEY PULL. IT OUT WE GET MORE DEVICE IS STUDENTS IN SAN FRANCISCO THERE EVEN. THE REX ANYWAY THAT YOU CAN GET AT KNOW ACT THE INNER SOME STRUCK PRO. TO EXPAND IT LEARNING UP SEE CANTIK COUNTY HAS CLEAN DATA MAKE A- AND TO SCHOOL THERE. AND IT IS. THAT WE SEE INTO. ONE THING THAT WILL BE. I IT IS LEGISLATURE MAY TAKE UP IS. NOT PERMITTING HOW DO WE GET CONSIST COM. TO ALLOW FOR THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT NEEDED CALIFORNIA TO GET UNDER WAY WE ACTUALLY DO HAVE A FEW OF PROJECTS THAT. ARE INTENDED TO BE HELPFUL BUT THEY HAVE BEEN I'LL BE HONEST WITH HIM BLOCK. EVEN BY BY CALTRANS AND WE USE THE TASK FORCE TO ESTABLISH RELATIONSHIPS WITH CALTRANS THE STATE. HEY LET'S REMOVE THE BARRIERS SO THAT WE CAN YOU KNOW GET YOU KNOW GET ONCE AND GET THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE. TO SUPPORT WHATEVER THAT PROJECT WAS AS WELL AS THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND SO. WE THINK WE'RE GONNA SEE MORE MORE CITIES. MUNICIPALITIES SCHOOL DISTRICTS GETTING INVOLVED IN THE DIRECT PROVISION- OF BROADBAND BECAUSE OF. THE BARRIERS THAT HAVE EXISTED WITH SOME OF THE TRADITIONAL ICE PCHS. WE'RE NOT WILLING- COULD BRING- THE RESOURCES AT TO THE AREA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I DO DO TO HIGHLIGHT THAT- WE HAVE A LOT URBAN MEMBERS HERE SUBURBAN MEMBERS BUT- I GUESS WE HAVE A COUPLE OF. FOLKS OUT THERE WERE SOME RURAL AREAS IN THIS THIS ISSUE IS KIND OF DIFFERENT IN A RURAL AREA WHERE YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE ACCESS AT ALL- EVEN IF YOU CAN'T PAY. YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE IT SO THIS ISSUE EXPANDS THAT DYNAMIC AS WELL- MR KILEY. THANK YOU I HAVE A- QUESTIONS FOR SUPERINTENDENT- BERMAN I FIRST WANT TO- COMMEND YOU ON THE WORK YOU'VE DONE. WITHOUT REACH TO THE I. S. P.'S- IN ORDER TO EXPAND ACCESS- I THINK THAT'S MADE A- BIG DIFFERENCE FOR A LOT OF CALIFORNIA FAMILIES SO I WANTED TO GIVE YOU CREDIT FOR THAT. HI THIS IS. INNOVATION COMPETITION YOU MENTIONED ALSO SOUNDS INTERESTING THAT. PERHAPS IT'LL SERVE AS A REMINDER THAT- INNOVATION AND COMPETITION AND PUBLIC EDUCATION OUR VIRTUES TO BE ENCOURAGED. AND NOT VICE IS TO BE STAMPED OUT AS- THAT'S KIND OF IN THE BENT OF OUR STATES- POLITICAL LEADERSHIP BUT I WANTED TO TAKE A MOMENT TO ASK YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE THE- LACTAID. STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION YOUR- CALIFORNIA'S- TOP EDUCATION. LEADER OTHER THAN PERHAPS THE GOVERNOR. AND SO I'M GONNA ASK YOU IS AS YOU WORK DILIGENTLY- ON THESE ISSUES. TO EXPAND BROADBAND ACCESS. I DO ALSO AGREE WITH THE SENTIMENT THAT. ME AND MISTER O'DONNELL APPEAR TO SHARE- THAT WE NEED TO RETURN TO CLASSROOM. BASED INSTRUCTION AS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. YOU IF I MAY KILEY WE APPRECIATE YOUR QUESTION AND I'LL GIVE THEM A CHANCE TO ANSWER MAYBE IN A VERY SHORT MAN BECAUSE- THAT REALLY IS NOT THE FOCUS OF THIS HEARING. THE FOCUS OF THIS HEARING IS ON ACCESS TO THE INTERNET AND I SHARE YOUR PASSION. THAT STUDENTS GET BACK TO THE CLASSROOM IN A SAFE MANNER FOR- BASED ON SCIENCE NOT JUST POLITICAL SCIENCE BUT ACTUAL BIOLOGICAL EPIDEMIOLOGICAL SCIENCE- BUT I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE KEEP THE HEARING FOCUSED ON ACCESS WE CAN HAVE ANOTHER HEARING IN THE FUTURE. ON THE TOPIC OF GETTING KIDS BACK INTO THE CLASSROOM. BECAUSE I'M SUPPORTIVE OF THAT- AND I JUST REGISTERED AS ONE MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE FOCUSING ON THE PURPOSE OF THE HEARING I HAVE OVER THE NEXT TO ME. SO YOU HEARD ME THERE IT IS LET ME JUST THAT AND THEN CLARIFY MY QUESTION- AND I HAVE IN FACT THAT AFTER HEARING- SPECIFICALLY TO YOU. ON THE ISSUE OF SCHOOL RE OPENING BUT I'M SURE YOU WOULD AGREE THAT THE CHALLENGES WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW RELATED TO THIS DIGITAL DIVIDE. ARE VERY MUCH DEPENDENT UPON THE TIMELINE FOR THE RETURN TO IN CLASSROOM INSTRUCTION SO TO SAY THAT THAT'S NOT. RELATED TO THE TOPIC OF THE HEARING- IS OBVIOUSLY UNTRUE SO HI MISTER. THURMAN JUST WANT TO GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO ANSWER. THANK YOU FOR THE- ASSEMBLY MEMBER K. THANK YOU. FOR THE GUIDANCE ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHERYL DONAL. I LET LET ME CLEAR. RELATED TO THE CANDIDATE COMP INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY FOR US. TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO HARNESS. THE INNOVATION. ENTREPRENEURSHIP OF CALIFORNIA COMPANIES AND- OTHER INNOVATORS TO THINK THROUGH A SOLUTION. THAT HAS. YOU KNOW. TO A PROBLEM THAT HAS JUST REFLECT THE TWO FOR TOO LONG. AND SO I DO WANNA BE CLEAR IT'S NOT. IN ANY WAY SUGGESTION THAT WE PUT. COMPETITION IN THE EDUCATION THAT'S NOT A- THAT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT I SUBSCRIBE TO I THINK EVERY STUDENT. THAT YOU SAID TO KILEY IN THE SCHOLARSHIP. EQUITY ISSUES EVERY STUDENT DESERVES A HIGH QUALITY EDUCATION REGARDLESS OF THEIR DIFFICULT. AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE IN THIS PLACE IN THE FIRST PLACE IS THAT WE'VE SEEN. LIMITED INVESTMENT IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND URBAN AREAS AND RURAL COMMUNITIES BUT THE INNOVATION. COMPETITION IS ONE THAT SENT THE COMPANIES GET YOUR R&amp;D COOK IT. COME UP WITH SOME OF THE BEST IDEAS THAT HADN'T BEEN TRIED BEFORE. TO HELP US ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. IT MEANS THAT OUR STUDENTS AT STANFORD UNIVERSITY AND OTHER GREAT INSTITUTION. IN THE STATE IN THE NATION HAVE OPPORTUNITY. TO COME UP WITH IN A NEW WAY TO THINK ABOUT HOW TO ADDRESS. THE BROADBAND GAP INTO TRACKS HOW WE CREATE ON. SOURCES OF SUPPORT FOR PUTIN TO NEED. A WILL BE ANNOUNCING MORE IN THAT IN THAT WAY AGAIN I WANT TO. THANK DR GARY MICHELSON USED A BACON SB. INVESTMENT HERE AS WELL AS GENENTECH AND OTHERS WHO ARE INVESTING IN THIS GRANT NEW- INNOVATION. A COMPETITION. THAT WE'RE ABOUT THE ROLLOUT. AS IT RELATES TO THE OPENING OF SCHOOLS I THINK THAT AS A GENERAL KNOWLEDGE THAT IN THE BEGINNING WE ALL AGREE. THAT ULTIMATELY THE BEST PLACE FOR OUR STUDENTS IS TO BE IN SCHOOL BUT WHEN WE CAN GET THERE. WHEN WE CAN GET THERE WHEN THAT FAITH ENOUGH. FOR THEM TO DO SO. WE ARE SEEING SO MANY EXAMPLES OF PLACES WHERE THERE'S TOO MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE SAFETY. FOR OUR STUDENTS AND OUR EDUCATORS AND OUR FAMILIES. AND WE HAVE TO PROCEED CAUTIOUSLY AND THAT MEANS. THAT FOR NOW. FOR MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES. DEFENSE LEARN. IS OUR BEST OPTION. AND SO I WOULD YOU SEE ASSEMBLY CALLED CATCHING ON THE EQUITY THAT WOULD GIVE I THINK WE HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THIS IS EQUITY. WE HAVE TO. IT EVEN THOUGH. THE PAN. WE WERE SEEN DISPLAY. FOR STUDENTS OF COLOR TO THE INCOME. TO THIS IN URBAN AREAS AND RURAL AREAS. WHERE STUDENTS CAN HAVE AN- TO THE HEIGHTS. INTERNET WE- DIFFERENT. WERE DISTRICTS HAPPEN. THAT DOESN'T ALWAYS. KEEP YOUR APPETITE STANDARD TESTS ONE QUIT THAT DOESN'T ALWAYS. BECAUSE ARE DOING THEIR BEST JUST THE CALL TOGETHER WHAT THEY CAN GET. WE NEED A WHOLE DID REFORM WE MAY. AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE WE ARE TOP ABOUT. SCIENCE BEING AVAILABLE FOR EVERYONE OF OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS FROM PRESCHOOL TO TWELFTH GRADE SO WE'RE PREPARING THE WORKFORCE OF TOMORROW. IS THE BIGGEST EQUITY ISSUE OF OUR TIME WE DO HAVE TO WORK TO OFFSET LEARNING GAPS. AND HAVING ACCESS TO COMPUTERS IS A TOOL FOR DOING THAT IT DOESN'T REPLACE WHAT A GREAT PIECE YOU CAN DO. BUT WE'RE IN A TIME WHERE WE NEED THE TOOLS TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR TEACHERS CAN BE CONNECTED. TO OUR KIDS AND TO THAT END WE'RE EXCITED TO WORK WITH- THESE TWO COMMITTEES- AND THE AND THE LEGISLATORS ON THE- COMMITTEE- TO LOOK FOR SOLUTIONS- FOR CRAFTING- OUR DIGITAL DIVIDE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I CAN CERTAINLY SUBSCRIBE TO A LOT OF THE AND I APPRECIATE THE PAST AND- I JUST TO BE THAT YOU CAN YOU YOU ARE WILLING STATE ON A- THAT THE ONLY REASON. SCHOOL SHOULD REMAIN CLOSE RIGHT NOW- IS FOR SAFETY REASONS RELATED TO COVER. NINETEEN WELL SIXTY IS THE HIGHEST ORDER AT THIS TIME- I DON'T KNOW HOW. TO SPEAK TO IT I DON'T WANT TO POLITICIZE THIS ISSUE THIS IS ABOUT STATE FIRST. AND FOREMOST YOU HER CONDUCT LIMITER CUNNINGHAM AND- BE SEEN SO MANY EXAMPLES OF WHAT SCHOOLS ARE. OPEN TO SERVE. AND IT HAS RESULTED IN AND REAL HARM AND I'LL JUST SAY THAT WITHOUT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION HAS LITERALLY. ORGANIZED MEETINGS BETWEEN COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT AND COUNTY HEALTH OFFICERS. TO HELP US FIGURE OUT HOW TO TRACK THE DATA. ABOUT RATE OF INFECTION TO MAKE SMART STATE AGENCY ABOUT WHEN SCHOOLS CAN OPEN THERE ARE MORE QUESTIONS RIGHT NOW THAN ANSWERS. BUT WHAT IS CLEAR THAT WE CAN DO MORE WE STAND TOGETHER ON BEHALF HORRIFICALLY INCIDENTS IN. THE STATE PARAMOUNT- IT WILL CONTINUE TO PUSH THAT UNTIL IT'S SAFE FOR OUR SCHOOLS TO REOPEN. GREAT SO FOR THOSE WHO SAY THAT EVEN SCHOOLS THAT CAN SAFELY OPEN MAYBE SHOULDN'T BECAUSE IT'S UNFAIR FOR THEM TO HAVE A HEAD START. YOU WOULD. DISAVOW THAT LINE OF REASONING. NOT SURE ELSE TO PUT IT OTHER THAN THE FAKE IS PARA THAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING. I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE MANY SCHOOLS THAT ARE EXPERIMENTING WITH OPENING I THINK THEY'VE BEEN VERY. SOME OF BEING CREATIVE. WITH TRYING TO FIND HYRID- THAT MIGHT WORK OUT BUT THERE ARE STILL QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW. GREAT THE TRANSMISSION CAN OCCUR- THE NEW DATA THAT SAYS THAT KOBE COULD BE WITH US WELL BEYOND TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THERE'S NEW DATA THAT TALKS ABOUT- YOU KNOW HERE FOR TRANSMISSION RATE AND SHARING THE SAME INTERNET. YOU HAVE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT YOUR BILL TRANSIENT. AND THINK THAT WE JUST DO NOT KNOW AND CLEARLY LOTS OF PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT. HAS TO BE AVAILABLE I THINK THIS IS THE TIME FOR GO SLOW AND STEADY. AND BE FOCUSED ON FINANCE IN THE SAFETY AND OF COURSE WE ALL WANT TO DO ALL THAT WE CAN TO GET OUR- OUR STUDENTS BACK TO SCHOOL TO AS POSSIBLE. BUT WE JUST CANNOT SACRIFICE. IN THE MEDIA. THANK YOU. MR SANTIAGO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THIS KIND OF A QUESTION TO THE SUPERINTENDENT AND ALSO TO- DR GARLAND ON HAMMOND TO THE LARGEST CREE AND SOME OF THIS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO BE ANSWERED TODAY BUT I WANTED TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION AS WE MOVE FORWARD- A IN THE KIND AND THE WHOLE BIT CODED WORLD OF EDUCATION. TO THE DO YOU COULD MAYBE MAKE SOME COMMENT ANSWER WOULD BE APPRECIATED BUT WOULD UNDERSTAND- FOR THE TALENTS OF THESE QUESTIONS BECAUSE I THINK WE'LL TAKE A LOOK AT THIS AND I AND I THINK WE'VE ALL I FEEL THAT THAT THE DISPARITIES BETWEEN THOSE WHO HAVE AND THOSE WHO DOES WHO DON'T HAVE. ARE MORE EVIDENT THAN THAN EVER BEFORE TODAY WITH THE BILL'S INVITED DISTANCE LEARNING IT IN THE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR HAVE BEEN HARDER HIT BOTH THE IN COVERT INFECTIONS- DECLINING INCOME AND NOW EDUCATION. WE TALK ABOUT THE SPACES THE AREA OF SPACE FOR KIDS TO LEARN- BUT IS THERE IN BUT THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE'VE NOT TALKED ABOUT THAT PARTICULARLY SURROUND HOW TO BRIDGE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE EDUCATION AS OF AS IT RELATES TO LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR IS PARTICULARLY IF YOU'RE- A ENGLISH LEARNER. AND A LOT OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH- THE LITERACY- THE DIGITAL LITERACY LIKE I TAKE MYSELF BACK TO BEING A KID- MY PARENTS WERE UNDOCUMENTED AND DIDN'T HAVE LANGUAGE- PROFICIENCY IN ENGLISH. THE MAJORITY OF STUDENTS WHO WE ARE WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO REACH YOU DON'T HAVE. TABLETS ARE WHO DON'T HAVE DIGITAL CONNECTION ARE GONNA FALL INTO CATEGORIES. LIKE THAT. NOT EXCLUSIVELY THERE ARE OTHER COMMUNITIES AS WELL. ABOVE THE FOR THE COMMUNITY THAT I LARGELY REPRESENT. BECAUSE IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE IN AN AFFLUENT COMMUNITY A NEARBY CAR PROFESSIONAL- THERE'S A DIFFERENT SORT OF CONVERSATION AS IT RELATES TO DISTANCE LEARNING BUT IF YOU'RE REPRESENT THE COMMUNITIES I REPRESENT. IT'S WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THE PICTURES THE KIDS ARE SITTING ON AN IPHONE OR A LIFELINE PHONE OUTSIDE TO TALK ABOUT- BECAUSE I MAY BE THE ONLY INTERNET CONNECTION IN THE ENTIRE NEIGHBORHOOD TO SOME DEGREE AND STILL NOT. EQUITABLE WHEN IT COMES TO SPEEDS. LET ALONE TECHNOLOGY LEVEL LITERACY LEVEL ON EDUCATION. AND I THINK I'VE HAD THIS CONVERSATION WITH EDUCATION LEADERS AND- AROUND THIS ISSUE. HAS THERE BEEN GIVEN THE ROLE BOB IS A BIGGER MEET MEET SOME SORT OF EQUITY AS A COME THE DIGITAL DIVIDE AND LEARNING. YOU HAVE DOT TAKE NOT WE'VE GOT THE KNOWLEDGE THAT THERE IS SOME. DIGITAL pMOUNTAINS OF GAPS AND VALLEYS WHEN IT COMES TO. WORKING CLASS COMMUNITIES. THAT MAY NOT HAVE THAT- LET ALONE TRYING TO TEACH A KID. NOW GONE. IT WILL RECEIVE THE FOOD LINES AND LITERALLY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WE WORK WITH EVERY WEEK- WHERE PARENTS ARE SITTING IN FOOD LINES AND THEY OFTENTIMES WILL BRING THEIR EDUCATION PACKAGES AND SAY WHAT WHAT THE WHAT IS THIS. I CAN'T TRANSLATE I CAN'T. CAN'T DO ANYTHING WITH IT LET ALONE IF YOU HAVEN'T. LET ALONE IF YOU HAD ALL THE EQUIPMENT AT HOME WHAT WOULD YOU DO WITH IT ANYWAY. IT'S OF IT HAS TO BE SOME THOUGHT. DONE BEYOND JUST CONNECTING BECAUSE IT WOULD BE INADEQUATE TO THINK. THAT THE CONVERSATION ABOUT THE DISTANCE LEARNING. IS JUST ABOUT CONNECTION TABLETS. THERE'S SOME THOUGHT TO BE GIVEN. NOW IN THE FUTURE ABOUT LITERACY AROUND PARENTS. AND WHAT I WOULD CAN HOPEFULLY THE CARD HOLDER. APPROACH TO HOW THIS IS REALLY GONNA WORK. OTHERWISE WE WILL BE LEAVING A GENERATION OF. KIDS BEHIND- INCLUDED IN THAT CONVERSATION HAS TO BE CONVERSATION OF FAIRNESS TO TEACHERS- OR THE EDUCATION COMMUNITY AT LARGE BECAUSE IF. IF YOUR TEACHER EXPECTED TEACHER TODAY WHAT WOULD YOU DO WITH YOUR KIDS YEAH. MADE LIKE MANY OF US WHO HAVE TO WORK FROM HOME THE- COULD YOU IMAGINE ON ON ON AND ON. I NEED LESS THAN MINIMUM WAGE JOB AND HAVING TO DECIDE WHETHER YOUR KIDS GOING TO GET AN EDUCATION THAT DAY OR YOU'RE GOING TO GO TO OR YOU'RE GOING TO GO TO WORK AND THIS IDEA THAT YOU PUT A KID IN FRONT OF A COMPUTER AND THEY'RE JUST GONNA LEARN JUST DOESN'T REALLY MEET THE DEMAND OF THE DAY AND WHAT REALLY IS PRESENT. I GOT TWO KIDS A FOUR YEAR OLD AND A SEVEN YEAR OLD. THE SEVEN YEAR OLD HAS A BETTER TIME STANDING IN FRONT OF A STANFORD COMPUTER BUT THERE ARE MULTIPLE GLITCHES AND I'VE GOT THE FASTEST INTERCEDING INTERNET SPEED IN THAT AREA. AND THEY STILL BUMP OFF WHEN IT'S MORE THAN. WHAT IT'S TWO KIDS BUT IF I GET ON SOMETHING A BOMB CITING A RESTART COMPUTERS GOT TO GET GOING THERE'S A LOT OF. STUFF THERE THAT I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WOULD CONSIDER MYSELF SOMEWHAT. SOPHISTICATED WHEN IT COMES TO TECHNOLOGY AND I STILL STRUGGLE WITH THE COMPUTER TO GET BACK ON IN THAT LINK ZOOMS NOT CONNECTING AND THERE'S- ALL THESE DIFFERENT CHAT ROOMS YOU GOT TO GET INTO IT YOU GOTTA GET A SEPARATE CHAT ROOM AFTER YOU DO READING AND- AND I FORGOT WHAT THE THAT THIS IS SOMETHING START TESTING- ROOM THAT HE GOT. HE HAS TO GET IN TO GET TESTED AFTER DOES WORK I'VE GOT TO SNAP A PICTURE OF THIS THING AND I GOT TO SEND IT BACK TO THE TEACHERS GOTTA GET GRADED. IT'S GOING TO COME BACK IN THIS HOMEWORK IN THE AFTERNOON. SO COULD YOU IMAGINE. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT STRUGGLING COMMUNITIES. THAT HAVE TO MAKE THE DECISION. THEY EITHER WORK. OR HAVE YOU CAN GET EDUCATE. WELL IT IN EVEN THE ASSUMPTION THAT IT THAT IT THAT IT'S WORKING TO A LARGE DEGREE. I THINK WE HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE THAT. BOTH WITH TEACHERS WHO ARE EXPECTED TO TEACH. OUR THE SCHOOL DAY AND BOTH MY PARENTS. ARE IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT I TALK ABOUT IT SO THE REASON I SAY THAT IS BECAUSE- I KNOW I'M LONG WINDED BUT A VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT IT BECAUSE WHEN YEARS THAT I REPRESENT. THE YEARS THAT I REPRESENT AND I'LL SPEAK TO MY- I KNOW THE OTHERS HAVE THE SAME. SIMILAR SITUATION BUT I CAN'T SPEAK YOUR DISTRICTS OF SPEAK FOR THE ONE I REPRESENT- ARE EXPERIENCING THIS. AND IT'S NOT JUST THE ONE OFFERS NOT JUST TWO PEOPLE TALKING TO ME IT'S- OVER AND OVER AND- OVER AND- OVER. AND EVEN MY NEIGHBORS RECENTLY- AFTER ALMOST SIX MONTHS OR FIVE MONTHS THE PANDEMIC WERE ABLE TO. HUSTLE ENOUGH MONEY TO GET THE INTERNET. SERVICE AND OVER AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO. HOW TO GET NOW TABLETS AND IPHONES AND DO HOMEWORK WITH THE KIDS. SO AT SOME POINT TIME GETTING KIND OF REINVENT THE WAY THE EDUCATION IS BEING DONE- WHETHER IT'S DONE AT ALL YOU KNOW I KNOW I. WHETHER IT'S DONE DIFFERENTLY WHETHER IT'S DONE SHORTER A SHORTER DAYS. I'M CERTAINLY NOT TRYING TO GET IN BETWEEN. ANY ANY AGREEMENTS THE LOCAL DISTRICTS HAVE MADE WITH ITS WORKFORCE BY THINK IT'S TIME TO REIMAGINE FOR GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL. AND THINK ABOUT WHAT THE QUOTE UNQUOTE DAY AFTER LOOKS LIKE. THE DAY AFTER COOPER WE'RE GOING BE BROUGH TO BE SENT AROUND. NO THAT. WHAT HAVING GOOD KNOWLEDGE POTENTIALLY AND I HOPE NOT I HOPE THAT I'M WRONG. THE GENERATION THE KIDS GOT LEFT BEHIND BECAUSE WE COULDN'T TAKE A LOOK AT SOME SERIOUS PROBLEMS AND IDENTIFY THEM EARLY AND START WORKING ON IT FOR THAT. DAY AFTER. AND THAT DATE IS HAPPENING. I DO WANNA THROW THAT OUT THERE BECAUSE I THINK IT'S A VERY SERIOUS CONVERSATION THE- TO CONTINUE HAVE I KNOW WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE WALL ROLLING IN THE SAME DIRECTION BUT FOR THE SAKE OF. FOR THE FOR THE SAKE OF REPRESENTED JUST THE DISTRICTS IN THE REGION THAT I REPRESENT. THIS HAS TO BE AT THE FOREFRONT OF OUR COMMUNITIES. AS I HEAR EVERY DAY FROM PARENTS. THERE'S THAT LANGUAGE BARRIER. THERE'S THAT PRESSURE TO GO TO WORK. AND THERE'S KIDS AT HOME. AND IN THE DISTRICT THAT I REPRESENT THAT I REPRESENT IT. THE SCHOOL DISTRICT FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND. SOMETIMES IF YOU SEND ME EMAIL THE NIGHT BEFORE THAT CONSTITUTES. THE STATE OF YOUR PRESENT THAT DAY. LET ME THAT THIS IS NOT JUST TO PRESENT RIGHT HAS NOT. KID RECEIVE AN EDUCATION IF YOU TURN IN THE HOMEWORK THAT WAS A SIGN FOR THREE DAYS. THAT CONSTITUTES THE STUDENT BEING IN CLASS FOR THREE DAYS. SO CERTAINLY IS GONNA BE BETTER METRICS TO BETTER MEASUREMENTS AND WASTE ACTUALLY REALLY DIG INTO WHAT'S GOING ON AND EVEN IF WE CAN'T ADDRESS ANOTHER HUGE BARRIERS. GOT IT AT LEAST TAKE A LOOK AT HOW TO BEGIN TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES. YEAH THANK YOU FOR YOUR CALL. QUESTION YOU TAKE A LOT OF PAIN HE STARTED WITH ACCESS. THIS IS YOUR RIGHT THIS IS MORE THAN AN ACCESS ISSUE. WE HAVE TO GET PROVIDE LITERACY AND TRAINING. FOR STUDENTS AND FAMILIES. AND FOR EDUCATORS- RIGHT NOW SOME OF OUR PARTNERS APPLE AND OTHERS. ARE HELPING US TO LAUNCH SOME TRAINING PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR EDUCATORS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY- ARE ABLE TO USE THE TECHNOLOGY- IT SERVES AS AN ACTIVE ISSUE- YOU KNOW WE'RE WITH. YOU KNOW SOME OF OUR COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION TO COME UP WITH GREAT WAYS TO. TO WORK ON THE DIGITAL LITERACY THAT YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT PARTICULARLY FOR ENGLISH LEARNERS. I'D LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE STANDARD YOU KNOW COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION. SUPERINTENDENT CRYSTAL MONCEAU. AND NAPA COUNTY. SUPERINTENDENT DR BARBARA NEMCO. OUT THERE WORKING WITH SOME TECHNOLOGY PROGRAMS THAT REALLY WORK YOUR SUPPORT RECOGNITION LEARNERS. AROUND LITERACY BUT ARE ARE ALSO BUILDING. DIGITAL LITERACY AND SO. YOU KNOW WE WANT TO GO FOR. WITH THE MEMBERS OF THESE TWO COMMITTEES IN A WAY WHERE WE AT THE TASK FORCE AND THE- MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE IN THE LEGISLATURE. ARE WORKING ON A COMPREHENSIVE WAY. TO ADDRESS THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. ACCESS TO DEVICES- ACCESS INFRASTRUCTURE FOR CONNECTIVITY. TRAINING AND SUPPORT. ON HOW TO DO THESE DEVICES SETTING GOOD STANDARDS. FOR PROMOTING DIGITAL LITERACY. WE WANT ADDRESSED THE CASH THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT. YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT WE'RE ALL ON JUNE TOGETHER IT WENT IN OUR HOMES USING. GIVES IT WHAT WE'RE FINDING IS. WE ALL GET KICKED OFF AND SOMETIMES I IS PEACH HALVES TAX. WHERE YOU GET KICKED OFF AT THE WHICH THE CAP. IT THAT COULD ACCEPT. FOR IN THE TWO FOR WILL BE TAKEN AT ISSUE A- IN MANY WAYS THE IT PROVIDES UP. FROM OF OUR FAMILIES. THEY HIT. THAT YEAH WE WERE. WITH OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT NOW TO ROLL OUT A NEW WAY TO DO FOR. ENGAGED TO MAKE SURE THAT FAMILIES ARE MORE AND MORE CONNECTED IF YOU POINT OUT. MAY YOUR FAMILIES ARE TRYING TO MAKE THE WORK WITH A SINGLE. RECORD STORIES ARE EQUITY POOR HAVE TO HOLD US ABOUT. MEMBERS WHO ONLY HAVE A SINGLE CELL PHONE IF THERE ALL TRYING USE. THAT FOR THE HOMEWORK THE- WERE. IN COMMUNICATE. AND WE THAT. FAMILY PROGRAM IS THE WAY THEY SURE THE FAMILIES A WAY TO BE CONNECTED THE SCHOOL. IS LIAISON SOMEONE CAN CALL. THAT'S WHAT WE ASK YOU TO HIGHEST. SHOULD BE KEPT PEOPLE TO. THE INTERNET COME TO YOU WHEN THEY A CROP. YOU GOTTA SIGN A LEASE WHO ANSWERED CALL IF SOMEONE WHO WAS. IN WHO CAN. AND SO ALL ECSTASY. THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH THE MEMBERS THESE TWO COMMITTEE TO BUILD A ROPE. AND WAY. TO ADDRESS QUOTE THE DIGITAL TO. MORE QUICK. BUILDING CAMPUS. CHOI IMPERFECTION THE- ON THE USE OF IT INCREASING DIGITAL WITH. STANDARDS THIS OF. IS ALL COMPLETETHE OF OUR- NOT YOUR POINT. TO WHAT EVERYONE BEGIN TO SET. THAT CAN IS US THINK. ABOUT HOW WE MEASURE. LOOKING AT THE- WAYS. TO ABOUT HOW WE MEASURE LEARN WE TALKING ABOUT THIS FOR A LONG TIME IF NOT ALL YOU ALWAYS. NOT THAT YOU KNOW WHICH- CAN. THAT GET THE PART AT. OF WHAT PEOPLE ARE. ON THE TAKE. YOU BEING GAY INSTEAD. THAT THEY HAVE ACCESS WITH DIGITAL WITH. SO AND THEY HAVE THIS MARKET SKILLS HELP THEM THE JOBS OF TWO. THAT THEY CAN IN A BLANK ALL OF THINGS ARE ARE REALLY PART OF A- CAR. THAT I BELIEVE EDUCATORS ACROSS THE WILL BE. ABOUT HOW DO YOU START TO LEARN. IN A DIFFERENT WAY GIVE THE CIRCLE. THAT WERE IN AND AGAIN. EVERYONE AT THE CAL COURT IN OF IT IN THE AND THE PATH OF COURSE TO THE- DANCE READY. TO WORK WITH ALL OF YOU THE MEMBERS OF THE TWO CAN. ON HOW THE BILL THAT WILL. POIGNANT QUOTE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. THANK YOU. THERE ARE INSTANCES WHERE IT DOES WORK PERFECTLY. BUT I DON'T THINK WE CAN CLAIM THIS IS BEEN A GRAND SUCCESS THIS HAPPENED IN A VERY RAPID FASHION. LOGISTICS ASSOCIATED WERE WERE HERCULEAN AND I THINK WE'RE DOING THE BEST WE CAN TO TRY AND MAKE IT WORK. BUT NOT NECESSARILY ALWAYS MAKING WORK. IT WORK AND I THINK OF ANYONE THINK SITTING A CHILD IN FRONT OF ANY AGE QUITE FRANKLY. IN FRONT OF A SCREEN FOR SIX AND A HALF HOURS A DAY AS A FACT OF I DON'T THINK THAT'S AFFECTED. MY TO BE EFFECTIVE EVERY ONCE IN AWHILE FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF LESSONS MAYBE. CERTAIN TAX AFFECT ACTIVITIES BUT JUST JUST TO HAVING A CHILD STARE AT A SCREEN IT'S PROBABLY NOT HEALTHY. PHYSICALLY OR MENTALLY. EMOTIONALLY BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S TERRIBLY AFFECTED EITHER I KNOW SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE KIDS ON ALL DAY AND I JUST. I DON'T I DON'T SEE HOW ANYONE CAN THINK THAT'S TERRIBLY EFFECTIVE. THERE ARE TIMES I NEED TO BE OFF SCREEN AND YOU KNOW MASTERING THE CONTENT ON THEIR OWN. WITHOUT NECESSARILY SCREEN. INTERACTION NINE TIMES A NEED TO BE ON- BUT WITH THAT LET'S MOVE ON A PANEL NUMBER TWO- AGAIN- PANEL NUMBER TWO WILL BE ADDRESSING INTERNET ACCESS AND THE IMPACT ON STUDENTS AND EDUCATORS. A REMINDER THAT WILL BE HOLDING OUR QUESTIONS UNTIL THE END OF THE DAY AGAIN THIS IS THE IMPACT OF STUDENTS- ED EDUCATORS I HAVE A LOT OF TEACHER FRIENDS I'M A TEACHER MYSELF I HAVE NOT TALKED. DISTANCE LEARNING AND THEY HAVE CALLED ME A COUPLE TIMES I'VE HELD OFF BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE THAT TASK MASTERED. OTHERS ARE BETTER THAN I. I SAW A LITTLE BIT AND FALL USUALLY THIS YEAR I'VE TAKEN A BIT OF A BREAK BECAUSE- I MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST ONE BEHIND THAT SCREEN. I DON'T HAVE ALL THOSE- YOU KNOW THE TECHNICAL STUFF MASTERED. BUT IT'S A CHALLENGE FOR TEACHERS TO OF PEOPLE SHOULD ACKNOWLEDGE HOW CHALLENGING THIS HAS BEEN. FOR TEACHERS TO NINETY I KNOW YOU SAID THAT YES YES. YES I JUST I JUST. I JUST WANT TO REITERATE THAT. LEAD TO TOTALLY CHANGE- THE WAY THEY DELIVER CONTENT AND THE WAITER DAY WORKED- SO- THIS IS BEEN AN INTERESTING VENTURE FOR ALL AND I. I KNOW TEACHERS. WHO ARE TRYING EVERY DAY TO MAKE THIS BETTER- SO WE'LL GO TO AGAIN- THE INTERNET ACCESS AND THE IMPACT ON STUDENTS AND EDUCATORS. I WILL BE TAKING QUESTIONS AT THE END AGAIN OUR FIRST BIG ROLE SPEAKER. IS MICHEAL ROMERO HE'S THE LOCAL DISTRICTS SOUTH SUPERINTENDENT. FROM THE LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. WHO IS JOINING US VIA REMOTE VIDEO FROM LOS ANGELES TODAY AGAIN- MICHAEL ROMERO YOU MAY PROCEED WHEN READY. THEY YES THANK YOU GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN O'DONNELL CHAIRMAN SO. CHAIRMAN SANTIAGO AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS HI MY NAME IS MICHAEL ROMERO AND I'M THE LOCAL DISTRICTS SOUTH SUPERINTENDENT FOR THE LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. AS YOU KNOW LOS ANGELES UNIFIED IS THE NATION'S SECOND LARGEST SCHOOL DISTRICT AND 80% OF OUR ALMOST SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS ARE FROM FAMILIES LIVING IN POVERTY. OVER SEVENTY THOUSAND OR 15% OF OUR STUDENTS HAVE A DISABILITY. AND APPROXIMATELY 20% OF ALL STUDENTS ARE ENGLISH LEARNERS. IN ADDITION MORE THAN NINETEEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS EXPERIENCED HOMELESSNESS AND MORE THAN EIGHT THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED LIVED IN FOSTER CARE. WHEN SCHOOLS ACROSS THE COUNTRY CLOSED IN MARCH ONE QUESTION ROSE TO THE TOP. HOW TO PROVIDE RELIABLE AND AFFORDABLE INTERNET FOR STUDENTS WHOSE FAMILIES COULD NOT AFFORD IT OR DID NOT OTHERWISE HAVE ACCESS TO IT. AT THAT TIME APPROXIMATELY 25% OF THE LOS ANGELES UNIFIED HOUSEHOLDS LACKED ACCESS TO STABLE CONNECTIVITY. LOS ANGELES UNIFIED ANSWERED THAT QUESTION IN MARCH BY CREATING A FIRST OF ITS KIND PARTNERSHIP WITH WERE WITH VERIZON TO PROVIDE UNLIMITED INTERNET ACCESS AT NO COST TO STUDENTS WHOSE FAMILIES COULD NOT OTHERWISE AFFORD IT. IN MAY WE MODIFIED OUR ORIGINAL AGREEMENT WITH VERIZON TO ALLOW OTHER SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN CALIFORNIA TO PIGGY BACK ON THE AGREEMENT. SO THEY COULD PROVIDE INTERNET ACCESS TO THEIR STUDENTS. THE RISE AND FURTHER DEVELOPED AND ROLLED OUT ITS DISTANCE LEARNING PROGRAM ACROSS THE COUNTRY THAT IS NOW AVAILABLE TO MORE THAN THIRTY EIGHT MILLION STUDENTS AND FORTY STATES INCLUDING THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. THE NEW SCHOOL YEAR IS WELL UNDERWAY AND ACCESS TO THE INTERNET CONTINUES TO PROVE TO BE A NECESSITY NOT A LUXURY. ALLOWING STUDENTS TO CONTINUE INSTRUCTION. STAY SOCIALLY CONNECTED AND COMPLETE DAILY WORK ASSIGNMENTS. ALL OF OUR STUDENTS HAVE BEEN GIVEN A DEVICE. INTERNET AND INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS AS WELL AS SUPPORT TO REPAIR OR REPLACE DEVICES AS NEEDED. HOT SPOTS WHICH CAN CONNECT AS MANY AS FIVE DEVICES AT A TIME OR PROVIDED TO FAMILIES WITHOUT ADEQUATE BAND WITH TO FULFILL THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS. WHO DO NOT HAVE INTERNET CONNECTIVITY AT HOME. LOS ANGELES UNIFIED'S ALL HANDS ON DECK APPROACH TO SUPPORTING STUDENTS IN SCHOOLS. IS REFLECTED IN OUR BARGAINING AGREEMENTS BY TEMPORARILY GRANTING CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES. THE FLEXIBILITY TO PERFORM DUTIES IN ASSIGNMENTS OUTSIDE THEIR CURRENT JOB DESCRIPTION. THOSE UNABLE TO WORK IN THEIR USUAL POSITIONS. WHILE SCHOOL FACILITIES ARE CLOSED WILL HELP STUDENTS ACCESS TECHNOLOGY. FOR ONLINE LEARNING AND RECEIVE TRAINING ON TOPICS SUCH AS ROOM IN CUSTOMER SERVICE. FOR EXAMPLE BUS DRIVERS ROUTE TECHNOLOGY CALLS THROUGH OUR HELP DESK HOTLINE. AND TRANSPORT DEVICES TO STUDENTS. WELL CAMPUS SEEDS AND SCHOOL SUPERVISION AIDES ARE HELPING TO DISTRIBUTE IN COLLECTIVE ICE'S AND INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS. OUR SCHOOL PRINCIPALS ARE REACHING OUT TO STUDENTS ARE HOMELESS AND ANY STUDENT OR FAMILY MEMBER WHO NEED SUPPORT CAN CALL ONE OF OUR HOTLINES OR REACH OUT TO THEIR TEACHER OR PRINCIPAL FOR SOME. WHILE WE PROVIDE INSTRUCTION VIA DISTANCE LEARNING TEACHERS WERE GIVEN THE OPTION TO TEACH FROM HOME OR FROM THEIR CLASSROOMS. WE HAVE SEVERAL THOUSAND TEACHERS OPTING TO TEACH FROM THEIR SCHOOL SITES IN THEIR CLASSROOMS. ALL STAFF PARTICULARLY TEACHERS HAVE ALSO BEEN EQUIPPED WITH DEVICES AND ACCESS TO INTERNET WE NEEDED. THE CHALLENGE FOR ANY SCHOOL DISTRICT IS HOW TO ADDRESS THE LONG TERM COST ASSOCIATED WITH THE MAINTENANCE AND REPLACEMENT OF DEVICES ONCE THEY EXCEED THEIR LIFESPAN AS WELL AS THE ONGOING COST OF CONTINUING TO PROVIDE. UNIVERSAL ACCESS TO THE INTERNET. TODAY LOS ANGELES UNIFIED HAS SPENT OVER ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. TO PAY FOR THE DEVICES AND HOT SPOTS. NOT INCLUDED IN THE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AS THE COST OF FUNDING OUR HELP DESK HOTLINE FOR FAMILIES AND EDUCATORS. TO ENSURE DEVICES ARE OPERATIONAL AND STUDENTS ABLE TO LOG IN AND SUCCESSFULLY NAVIGATE LEARNING PLATFORMS. IN CONCLUSION THE ABILITY TO CONTINUE PROVIDING UNIVERSAL ACCESS TO TOOLS SCENTIAL FOR SUCCESSFUL DISTANCE LEARNING PROGRAMS WILL REQUIRE SUPPORT FROM PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS AND INVESTMENT FROM THE LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS. WE ASK FOR A LONG TERM SUSTAINABLE SOCIAL SOLUTION TO MAINTAIN THAT CONNECTION. A STUDENT IN EVERY CALIFORNIA SCHOOL SHOULD BE GIVEN THE SAME BASIC EQUIPMENT JUST AS EVERY STUDENT IS ENTITLED TO WALK THROUGH A CLASSROOM DOOR AND HAVE A TEXTBOOK. TWEET QUIP EVERY STUDENT ACROSS THE STATE WITH A DEVICE AND INTERNET THE ANNUAL COST WOULD BE ABOUT SIX HUNDRED TO SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. ON BEHALF OF THE LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT I URGE THE LEGISLATURE AND THE STATE SUPERINTENDENTS DIGITAL DIVIDE TASK FORCE. TO DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES FOR A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE SO THAT SCHOOLS CAN GET ON WITH THE BUSINESS OF TEACHING AND LEARNING. WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS NO ONE SINGLE ANSWER OR SOLUTION TO ADDRESS THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. DUE TO THE COMPLEX NATURE OF INTERNET CONNECTIVITY AND IT'S FUNDING MECHANISMS. WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT A SUCCESSFUL SOLUTION MUST INCLUDE ACTIVE PARTICIPATION AND COMMITMENT FROM LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING TOGETHER ON EXISTING AND NEW EFFORTS TO COME UP WITH A SUSTAINABLE PLAN TO MAKE CONNECTIVITY FREE AND ACCESSIBLE TO EVERY STUDENT AND FAMILY ACROSS THE STATE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SUPERINTENDENT ROMERO OUR OUR NEXT SPEAKER WILL BE- ANGELES DE GAULLE PRESIDENT OF THE MERITORIOUS OF HIGH TEACHERS ASSOCIATION AND HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER FROM AMERICA'S VILLE JOINT UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT. MYSTIKAL IS IN THE VIDEO CONFERENCING ROOM INSIDE THE CAPITOL TODAY YOU MAY RECEIVE ALREADY. GOOD MORNING. MY NAME IS ANGELA STABLE. FOR ME TEACHING IS NOT MERELY A JOB IT IS A PASSION ONE THAT I SHARE WITH OVER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND PROFESSIONAL EDUCATORS ACROSS THE STATE. I'M IN MY TWENTY THIRD YEAR OF MARRIAGE HIGH SCHOOL WHERE I TEACH ENGLISH. COACH OUR CHAMPIONSHIP ACTIVITY KATHLYN TEAM AND SERVICE CO CHAIRPERSON OF THE ENGLISH DEPARTMENT. I SERVICE PRESIDENT OF LOW TEACHERS. THE MERRY'S WILL UNIFY TEACHERS ASSOCIATION WHERE I AM ALSO ON THE BARGAINING TEAM. ADDITIONALLY I'VE BEEN WITH THE INSTRUCTIONAL LEADERSHIP COURSE SINCE ITS INCEPTION. GIVEN THESE VERY ROLES I HAVE A UNIQUE MULTI FACETED PERSPECTIVE ON THE ISSUES OF STUDENT INTERNET ACCESS. MY STUDENTS AND I HAIL FROM YUBA COUNTY WITH A POPULATION OF APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND. WITH A MEDIAN ANNUAL HOUSEHOLD INCOME IS SLIGHTLY LESS THAN FIFTY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS WHICH IS ABOUT NINETEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS BEHIND THE STATE AVERAGE. AND AT LEAST 80% OF OUR RESIDENTS LIVE BELOW THE POVERTY LINE. MARYSVILLE JOINT UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT IS HOME TO APPROXIMATELY TEN THOUSAND AMAZING STUDENTS. NEARLY 22% OF OUR STUDENTS ARE ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS AND OVER 80% OF OUR CHILDREN ARE SOCIAL ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED AND OVER 12% OUR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES. OUR DISTRICT RUNS FROM ELEVATION OF SOME FIVE THOUSAND FEET DOWN TO THE VALLEY FLOOR. AND SOME OF OUR STUDENTS RIDE THE BUS OVER AN HOUR ONE WAY. OUR LARGEST ETHNIC GROUPS ARE HISPANIC LATINO AT APPROXIMATELY 43% OF OUR STUDENT POPULATION. AND WHITE AT APPROXIMATELY THIRTY SIX PERCENT. HOWEVER THAT VARIES WIDELY FROM SITE TO SITE. IF YOU BRING UP INTERNET CONNECTIVITY OF MY STUDENTS THEY WILL TELL YOU THE STRUGGLE IS REAL. AND IF YOU ASK TEACHERS IN MY DISTRICT THEY WILL ECHO THE SENTIMENT. ONE OF THE MANY REASONS FOR THIS IS THE FACT THAT MY STUDENTS FALL INTO ONE OF THREE DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT GROUPS. THOSE THAT HAVE FULL INTERNET CONNECTIVITY. THOSE THAT HAVE PROBLEMATIC OR MINIMAL INTERNET CONNECTIVITY. AND THOSE WHO LACK THE INTERNET COMPLETELY. A NUMBER OF OUR TEACHERS ALSO EXPERIENCE A COMPLETE ABSENCE OF OR POOR INTERNET SERVICE AT HOME. ADDITIONALLY THE TIME REQUIRED TO PREP FOR AND PROVIDE ALL ASPECTS OF DISTANCE LEARNING. INCLUDING ONLINE ENGAGEMENT STRATEGIES IN A RELATIONSHIP BUILDING. IS EXPONENTIALLY GREATER THAN WHAT IS NECESSARY FOR OUR REGULAR CLASSES. FOR EXAMPLE OUR STUDENTS VERY LEVELS OF CONNECTIVITY MAKE IT EXTRAORDINARILY DIFFICULT TO GAUGE HOW LONG IT WILL TAKE STUDENTS TO COMPLETE LESSONS OR ASSIGNMENTS. ALTHOUGH MY STUDENTS ARE RESILIENT THEIR INTERNET CONNECTIVITY ISSUES ARE IMPEDING THEIR ABILITY TO ACCESS AND PARTICIPATE IN THEIR DISTANCE LEARNING. LEARNING THAT I IN NEARLY FIVE HUNDRED OTHERS ARE TIRELESSLY TRYING TO PROVIDE FOR THEM. RECENTLY ONE OF MY STUDENTS ASK FOR AN EXTENSION ON AN ASSIGNMENT. SHE EXPLAINED IN A LENGTHY ON PUNCTUATED A MOTIONAL EMAIL THAT HER INTERNET DIED. AFTER AN APPEARANCE BY THE BLUE CIRCLE OF DEATH AS SHE TRIED TO SENATOR SIMON ONLINE AND THEN IT WAS GONE. AS SHE EXPLAINED. GONE STEEG JUST GONE GONE LIKE HOMEMADE COOKIES LEFT ON THE COUNTER. AFTER WE WORKED FOR OVER AN HOUR TO UNSUCCESSFULLY FINE- ASSIGNMENT SHE DEJECTEDLY MATTERED THAT SHE WOULD DO THE ASSIGNMENT AGAIN. WHICH I DID NOT REQUIRE HER TO DO. UNFORTUNATELY THOUGH THIS SITUATION IS NOT AN ANOMALY. ONE OF THE MORE TRYING ASPECTS OF OUR DISTANCE LEARNING HAS INVOLVED VIDEO CONFERENCING I HAVE STUDENTS WHO SPEND MORE TIME TRYING TO JOIN OR STAY IN HIS ROOM SESSION THEN THEY ACTUALLY SPEND IN THAT SESSION. IN MY EMAIL YOU CAN FIND VARIATIONS OF SORRY ABOUT THE ZOOM BUT MY INTERNET HATES ME. IT IS NOT UNUSUAL FOR SOME OF MY STUDENTS TO HAVE TO RE ENTER SESSION MULTIPLE TIMES. MISSING OUT ON VALUABLE LEARNING TIME IN THE PROCESS. UNFORTUNATELY ZOOM SITUATION ISN'T RESERVED JUST FOR STUDENTS. TWO WEEKS AGO I WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF A SENTENCE IN A RIVETING CLASS DISCUSSION AND THE SCHOOL Y. FIVE JUST QUIT. I WAS FINALLY ABLE TO RECONNECT WITH MY CLASS ON THE RESUME. JUST AS MY VICE PRINCIPAL WALKED IN AND ASKED IF I WAS OK. ONE OF MY STUDENTS HAD ACTUALLY CALLED THE SCHOOL CONCERNED ABOUT ME. WE LOST APPROXIMATELY TEN MINUTES OF PRECIOUS CLASS TIME AND STUDENTS ARE FREQUENTLY LOSING TEN MINUTES OF MULTIPLE CLASSROOMS OR WHOLE CLASS PERIODS OR EVEN WHOLE DAYS OF INSTRUCTION DO A POOR INTERNET CONNECTION. OR WORSE MISSING OUT ON DISTANCE LEARNING ENTIRELY DUE TO NO INTERNET AT ALL. AND PROMISES TO REMEDY THE SITUATION IN TWO MONTHS OR TWO YEARS OR MORE OUR FRANKLY UNACCEPTABLE. SOME MAY THINK BUT WHAT ABOUT ALL THE HOT SPOTS GIVEN TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS. MY DISTRICT RECEIVED SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY OF THOSE HOT SPOTS AND PURCHASED ANOTHER ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE IN A FULL PRESS EFFORT TO HELP OUR STUDENTS. AS MY FOOT HILL STUDENTS HAVE EXPLAINED TO ME. I'M ON MY THIRD HOT SPOT AND KEEPING MY FINGERS CROSSED IT DOES THE TRICK. OR I'M WAITING ON A LIST FOR THE RIGHT HOT SPOT. OUR FOOT HILLS ARE COVERED BY CELL TOWERS FROM THREE MAJOR TELECOMMUNICATION COMPANIES. SO IT'S LIKE A TWISTED GAME OF HOT AND COLD WHEN OUR STUDENTS TRY TO OBTIN INTERNET SERVICE. AND WHEN IT'S DETERMINED THAT THEIR HOUSES TO COLD IN RELATION TO A CELL TOWER. THERE THEN FORCED PURSUE SATELLITE POINT TO POINT FOR INTERNET. FOR SOME OF MY STUDENTS THEIR SATELLITE LINE RUNS FROM THE TOP OF THE TREE TO THEIR HOME. I ALSO HAVE STUDENTS WHO COULD WIN THE LOTTERY TODAY AND NOT BE ABLE TO GET INTERNET ACCESS TOMORROW BECAUSE IT SIMPLY DOESN'T EXIST WHERE THEY LIVE. THESE CAN ACTIVITY ISSUES RESULT IN TROUBLING EQUITY ISSUES AND THESE EQUITY ISSUES ARE FELT EVEN MORE PROFOUNDLY ARE VULNERABLE SPECIAL EDUCATION. ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNER FOSTER YOUTH AND HOMELESS STUDENT POPULATION. ALL OF WHICH FLIES IN THE FACE OF WHAT WE KNOW SHOULD BE TRUE AND WHAT WE DESPERATELY WANT TO BE TRUE. THAT ALL STUDENTS HAVE EQUAL ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY EDUCATION. I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT THE HOME OF THE WORLD'S FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY AS WELL AS THREE OF THE FIVE TECH GIANTS. ALONG WITH NEARLY NINETY INTERNET PROVIDERS CAN BRING RELIABLE HIGH SPEED INTERNET ONCE AND FOR ALL TO ALL OF MY STUDENTS. AND ALL OF THE OVER SIX MILLION STUDENTS IN THIS GOLDEN STATE. REGARDLESS OF THEIR ZIP CODE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR SPIEGEL VERY GOOD JOB- WILL NOW PROCEED TO- ERIN APTI REPRESENTING THE EQUITY COALITION MISHAP D. AS IN THE VIDEO CONCERT OR IN VIDEO CONFERENCING ROOM INSIDE THE CAPITOL- MISHAPS YOU MAY PROCEED ONE READY. HELLO MY NAME IS ERIN ATTY I'M HERE TODAY REPRESENTING THE VIEWS OF THE ALTHEA FAST EQUITY COALITION I WORK A PUBLIC ADVOCATES IS LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME TODAY TO TALK ABOUT OUR WORK ON THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. INEQUITIES IN ACCESS TO INTERNET SERVICE AND TECHNOLOGY EXISTED FOR CHILDREN IN POVERTY AND CHILDREN OF COLOR LONG BEFORE BECAUSE I THINK. AT THE START OF THIS CRISIS ONE IN FIVE. SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN LACK ACCESS TO THE INTERNET AT HOME. WE APPLAUD THE ADMINISTRATION LEADERS ACROSS THE STATE AND SUPERINTENDENT THURMAN'S. DIGITAL DIVIDE TASK FORCE FOR WORKING TOWARD SUSTAINABLE SO. TO ADDRESS AN ACT. WE BELIEVE THAT BUILDING A DIGITAL INTEREST AND CLOSING THE DOOR IS A STATE OR- AND NOT JUST AN IMPERATIVE FOR SCHOOL. HOW A DEVICE IN A RELIABLE INTERNET CONNECTION IS NOT FUNDAMENTAL FOR EVERY STUDENT TO RECEIVE A QUALITY PUBLIC EDUCATION THAT IS THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT. WE APPRECIATE THAT THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE MADE IT CLEAR IN THE BUDGET TRAILER BILL THE DAILY AS MUST PROVIDE STUDENTS WITH ACCESS TO DEVICES AND CONNECTIVITY WHEN DELIVERING DISTANCE LEARNING. IN ADDITION TO TRYING THIS YEAR'S FUNDING TO UNIVERSAL STUDENT HAVE TO PASS TO A LAPTOP AND THE INTERNET. FTA TWENTY THE BUDGET TRAILER BILL FRANCE LAST MONTH. ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT ACCESS TO DEVICES AND CONNECTIVITY IS NOT PERMANENT I'M GOING TO STUDY. FOR ALL STUDENTS BY MAKING THEM A PART OF THE DEFINITION OF INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS. IN OUR EDUCATION BECAUSE- THIS CHANGE INTERFAX IN IMPORTANT WAYS TO THE LANDMARK WILLIAM SETTLEMENT LEGISLATION. THAT AMONG OTHER THINGS THAT THE MINIMUM STANDARDS THAT ALL STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE ACCESS TO TEXTBOOKS. AND INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS TO USE IN CLASS AND TO TAKE HOME. THE WILLIAMS VERSUS CALIFORNIA CASE WAS FILED JUST OVER TWENTY YEARS AGO BY THE ACLU PUBLIC ADVOCATES ANOTHER. CHALLENGING TO SEPARATE AND UNEQUAL CONDITIONS THAT EXISTED IN OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS. INCLUDING INADEQUATE ACCESS TO TEXTBOOKS FOR SO MANY LOW INCOME. BLACK LAND NEXT AN ENGLISH LEARNERS. TODAY THE DEMANDS OF THE PANDEMIC IN THE EVER INCREASING USE OF DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY ONLY UNDERSCORE THE WISDOM OF THE LEGISLATURE UPDATE TO THE DEFINITION OF INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS. TO INCLUDE LAPTOPS AND INTERNET ACCESS. THIS THAT THE HAS THE FOLLOWING IMPORTANT AND IMMEDIATE IMPACT ON THE WILLIAMS ACCOUNTABILITY PROVISIONS THAT REQUIRE ALL STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO SUFFICIENT STRUCTURAL MATERIALS. ONE ALL DISTRICTS EXCUSE ME ALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS MUST THE FACT AND PUBLICLY REPORTING CORRECT INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIAL INSUFFICIENCIES. INCLUDING OUR LACK OF ACCESS TO DEVICES AND CONNECTIVITY BY THE EIGHTH WEEK OF SCHOOL. CHINESE THE GRANT TENANTS WILL SURVEY ALL SCHOOLS ON THE WILLIAMS INSPECTION LAST. CURRENTLY ABOUT ONE QUARTER SCHOOLS IN THE STATE AND I IN. AND BOOK AND STUFF MATERIALS INCLUDING DIGITAL ACCESS. THAT ARE NOT CORRECTED WITHIN THE FIRST TWO MONTHS OF THE YEAR SO THAT THESE MATERIALS TO BE PURCHASED FOR STUDENTS BY THE STATE ON THE DISTRICTS ACCOUNT. THREE WILLIAMS COMPLAINTS REGARDING INSUFFICIENT STRUCTURAL MATERIALS NOW INCLUDE LAPTOPS AND CONNECTIVITY. AND LASTLY ELLIE IS OVER FOR AN INSUFFICIENCY OF INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS. INCLUDING DEVICES THE CONNECTIVITY. IN NOVEMBER SCHOOL ACCOUNTABILITY REPORT. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT ALL USING COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION BE AWARE UP AND WORK TO IMPLEMENT THESE PROVISIONS IMMEDIATELY. RIGHT RECENT EFFORTS WE KNOW THE PHYSICAL PROCESS. ANECDOTALLY WE HONOR EQUITY I HEARING FOR THE CENTRAL HAS SOME OF THE GREATEST NEED. SOME DISTRICTS ARE OFFERING WIFI IN THE DISTRICT PARKING LOT FOR STUDENTS WHO LACK AN ACTIVITY. SOME FAMILIES ARE SENDING THEIR CHILDREN TO VISIT RELATIVES IN MEXICO AFTER STABLE INTERNET NECESSARY FOR INSTRUCTION. AND MANY STUDENTS ARE RESORTING TO MOBILE PHONES HOT SPOT. WHICH LACK ACCESS TO CAPACITY TO RUN VIDEO AND OTHER INSTRUCTIONAL SUPPORT. OR THEY ARE USING THEIR CELL PHONES ACCESS CLASSES BECAUSE THEY LACK ACCESS TO A DEVICE. HERE IN SACRAMENTO STUDENTS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND LIVING IN MOTELS HI THERE WIFI TURNED OFF REMOTE OFF DOCTOR IN THE DAY. TO DISSUADE THEM FROM DOING DISTANCE LEARNING ON SITE. IF CHALLENGES ARE COMPOUNDED FOR STUDENTS WITH ADDITIONAL NEEDS SUCH AS STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES ENGLISH LEARNERS AND FOSTER YOU. YEAH CRITICAL LISTENING HEARD OF POLICYMAKERS TO TAKE A MULTI FACETED APPROACH TO ADDRESS THESE CRITICAL CONCERNS AND PROVIDES THE FOLLOWING RECOMMENDATIONS. SHANKLIN MONITORING OF DIGITAL ACCESS DISTRICTS AND COUNTIES MUST EXPAND A WILLIAMS PROFICIENCY HEARINGS AND INSPECTIONS TO CHECK FOR ACCESS TO DEVICES INFECTIVITY. RESTAURANTS GIVE ME A SEVERANCE MUST CONSIDER THAT EVEN WHEN STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO A DEVICE IN THE HOT SPOT THEY MAY LACK THE TECHNICAL SUPPORT NEEDED TO INITIATE OR SUSTAIN ACCESS. WE RECOMMEND OF THE STATE ABOUT THE STANDARD SET OF QUESTIONS. FOR LDS PAST UNIONS AND FAMILIES AND FOR COUNTY STAFF SCHOOLS O DETERMINE THE BLT IS PROVIDING. ACCESS TO DEVICES ON A ONE TO ONE BASIS. CONSISTENT CONNECTIVITY WHICH WOULD REQUIRE REGULARLY CHECKING IN WITH STUDENTS AND FAMILIES. TO A FASTER ACCESS. TECHNOLOGIES FOR STUDENTS AND PARENTS INCLUDING A STUDENTS HOME LANGUAGE. AND SUPPORT TO ADDRESS LEARNING THE BASIC NEEDS SUCH AS PROVIDING HEADPHONES. STOP CANCEL OUT EXCESSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NOISE. IF YOU PART OF THE PROTOCOL FOR ABSENT STUDENTS RE ENGAGEMENT REQUIRED BY THE BUDGET TRAILER BILL SHOULD INCLUDE ASSESSING INTERNET ACCESS STRENGTH AND RELIABILITY OF CONNECTION AND ADDRESSING BARRIERS AND DEFICIENCIES. WE ALSO RECOMMEND THE DISTRICTS HAVE A CLEAR STRATEGY TO ADDRESS LOST INSTRUCTIONAL TIME DUE TO INADEQUATE INTERNET CONNECTIVITY. THIS COULD INCLUDE FOR EXAMPLE A REQUIRED STATE POLICY OF RECORDING AND POSTING LAUGHTER. FINALLY GIVEN THE SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS. THE FAMILIES OF ENGLISH LEARNERS FACE WE STRONGLY ENCOURAGE ELOISE TO USE MULTI. LINGUAL TECHNOLOGY BUT A LOT OF LEGISLATORS TO TRANSLATE INFORMATION TO MULTIPLE LANGUAGES. COMMUNICATING WITH FAMILIES AND DIGITAL FOR. TODAY HAVING A DEVICE AND ACCESS TO THE INTERNET AS A FUNDAMENTAL TO LEARNING AS THE TOP WHAT WAS IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU TO CLOSE THE CONNECTIVITY GAP ONCE AND FOR ALL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU TO OUR TO ALL OF OUR THREE PRISONERS NOW ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS MISS SMITH. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WILL BE BRIEF I JUST LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT I THINK WE WOULD BE REMISS IF WE DIDN'T ACKNOWLEDGE AND THANK OUR EDUCATIONAL PROFESSIONALS WHO ARE PART OF THIS LAST PANEL IN THE LEADERSHIP THEY AND OTHER LEADERS AND OUR TEACHERS ACROSS THE STATE- HAVE SHOWN AND DEMONSTRATED DURING THIS CRISIS ALL OF OUR TEACHERS ALL OF OUR ADMINISTRATORS HAVE STEPPED UP BEEN CREATIVE ADDRESS THIS MOMENT TRIED TO MEET THE CHALLENGES OF THIS MOMENT IN EVERY WAY POSSIBLE ON BEHALF OF OUR STUDENTS AND- THEY DESERVE THAT RECOGNITION STATEWIDE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER. SMITH VERY VERY TRUE MISS AGUIAR-CURRY.

WHAT WAS THAT PER PARTICULAR. DOES ANYONE WANT TO TAKE THAT QUESTION ON. LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE A. SHE SHE MAY BE SPEAKING BUT WE CANNOT HEAR HER. APOLOGIES I THOUGHT. OF IT WE ARE FACTORED IN ACTIVITIES YOU. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION YES I AM THE WE HAVE A GREAT EXAMPLE OUT OF MENDOTA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT WHERE TEACHERS RECOGNIZE THAT PRIORITIZING RELATIONSHIP BUILDING AND COMMUNICATION PARTICULARLY FOR NEWCOMER MARKET STUDENTS IS ESSENTIAL FOR THE STUDENTS AND FAMILIES TO BE SUCCESSFUL DIGITAL LEARNING. FUTURE TO MADONNA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT MET WITH NEWCOMER IMMIGRANT STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES AT THE START OF THE SCHOOL YEAR WITHIN THE VERY FIRST THREE WEEKS OF SCHOOL TO ESTABLISH OPEN LINES OF COMMUNICATION. SHOULD YOUR NEEDS ASSESSMENT TO PROVIDE TECHNOLOGY TRAINING INCLUDING. TROUBLESHOOTING ON. OR I'M A MENTAL IS THE CALIFORNIA AT A WEALTHY BRAND FUNDED READY WAS IS WORKING SPECIFIC WITH NEW CAR MARKET FAMILIES HE SAID STUDENTS IMPAIR A PRIEST THERE HAS CALL AND THAT HAS TO BE WITH FAMILIES AND MEET THEM WHERE THEY AT BUT IT'S REALLY THAT YOU OUR NEEDS IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO ASSIST THEM WITH NAVIGATING THIS COMPLICATED ONLINE ORDER FORMS AS THEY CAN BEFORE IT PARTICULARLY. FOR NEW. THEY YOU. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER. THIS PERSON YET I DO HAVE A QUESTION AND YOU KNOW THE CHAIRMAN OF- COMMUNICATIONS BROUGHT UP SOME OF THE PERSONAL HARDSHIPS THAT HE'S EXPERIENCED- THE ISSUE OF- PARENTS AND THE TECHNOLOGY. TRANSLATION TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE HAPPENING I'M WONDERING IF ANY OF THE FOLKS THAT PROVIDED TESTIMONY- CAN I SHARE ANY THOUGHTS ANNIE- EXPERIENCES THAT THEY'VE- SEEN WITH SOME OF THE- PARENTS- THERE ARE WORKING WITH THE STUDENTS FROM HOME- ARE HOW THEY'RE ENGAGING THEM YOU KNOW WE HAVE. MEMBERS IN OUR COMMUNITY THAT- I'VE NEVER HAD THE TECHNOLOGY- THAT THIS IS VERY NEW AND THEY'RE HAVING TO ALSO LEARN AS THEY GO WITH THEIR STUDENTS NOT TO MENTION THE- LANGUAGE- A BARRIER IN SOME INSTANCES AS WELL SO I'M WONDERING IF WHETHER. SOMEONE FROM THE VALLEY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT FOR THE TEACHERS ASSOCIATION OR FOR THAT MTTER AT THE EQUITY COALITION WOULD BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SOME INPUT ON- SOME EXPERIENCES AND OR BEST PRACTICE MODELS THAT ARE HAPPENING ALONG THE WAY- AS WE'RE DEALING WITH IS TECHNOLOGY DIGITAL DIVIDE. ISSUE THANK YOU. READ A SUPER TENDER AMERICA. GOOD HAND UP OVER HERE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT THE CALL. I THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE QUESTION YES- SO THE COMMENTS ABOUT THIS NOT BEING PERFECT AND IT'S BEEN CHALLENGING AND ESPECIALLY. FOR OUR FAMILIES THAT OUR MOST IMPOVERISHED ABSOLUTELY- THERE'S BEEN SOME REAL CHALLENGES WITH THAT- LAST SEMESTER MARCH WHEN WE CLOSE SCHOOLS THROUGH JUNE THERE'S A LOT OF PRACTICING A LOT OF. PLANNING FAST ACTING FAST AND FIXING FIXING FAST. AND HOW WE UNIFIED THE SUMMER WE OPENED UP SUMMER SCHOOL FOR ALL STUDENTS- FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER IN MY LOCAL DISTRICT A THIRD OF OUR FAMILIES AND STUDENTS TOOK US UP ON THAT ON THAT- OPTION. IT WAS ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO CONNECT WITHFAMILIES AND NOT TO HAVE TON HALL MEETINGS AND TUTORIAL SESSIONS AND JOB AIDS. SO THE LEARNING FROM LAST SEMESTER THIS SUMMER PEROTIS A PREPAREDNESS TO DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY TWO WEEKS PRIOR TO THE START OF THE SCHOOL YEAR. WE STARTED AUGUST EIGHTEENTH SO WHAT WE DID ACROSS THE DISTRICT AND ALL OF OUR SCHOOLS WE HAD SYSTEMATIC TOWN HALL MEETINGS. WE HAD JOB AIDS AT A DIFFERENT LEVEL. WE HAD HELP HELP LINES. AT A DIFFERENT LEVEL. STILL PROBABLY EVEN TO THE STATE NOT ENOUGH WE CAN GET BETTER WE HAVE TO GET BETTER- TO SOME OF THE COMMENTS. BUT WE FELT THAT THAT. THE WORK THAT WE DID IN PREPARING OUR PARENTS. WITH Q. R. CODES AND- THE HELP DESK AND- THE ALMOST LIKE A DRUMBEAT OF CORRESPONDENCE TO PARENTS VIA EMAIL CONNECTED MESSAGES. TEXTING EVEN U. S. MAIL LETTERS. HELP THOSE QUITE A BIT IN A IN A FAIRLY SMOOTH OPENING. BUT IT DIDN'T MEAN ALL KIDS WERE CONNECTED WE STILL- EVEN TILL THIS DAY- THERE OR OR SELECTED THEIR HOMELESS. IDENTIFIED HOMELESS STUDENTS IN EACH OF OUR SCHOOLS SMALL NUMBERS THAT WE STILL HAVEN'T CONNECTED WITH- WE BELIEVE AT THIS POINT THAT THEY HAVE THE FAMILIES PROBABLY MOVED OUT OF THE AREA- WE EVEN TO THE- TO THE QUESTION PRIOR ABOUT MATT MIGRANT YOUTH AND FAMILIES AND HOMELESS AND FOSTER YOUTH. WE WORK BUT WAS LIKE A BEELINE WE KNEW THAT WHEN WE OPEN SCHOOL AUGUST EIGHTEENTH. THAT THE FAMILIES THAT WOULD MOST STRUGGLE TO STILL CONNECT WOULD BE A HOMELESS OR FOSTER YOUTH. EARNER UARDIAN OF THE MIGRANT- ARE MIGRANT FAMILIES- IN OUR MOST IMPOVERISHED FAMILIES SO WHAT WE DID. THEY ALL GONNA U. S. MAIL LETTER SAYING. TECHSTERS COLAS GO TO THIS WEBSITE. WE FOLLOWED UP WITH EMAILS WE FOLLOWED UP WITH TEXT MESSAGES AND THEN WHEN WE FELT IT WAS SAFE JUST RECENTLY WE STARTED KNOCKING ON DOORS. SO WE DID IDENTIFY QUITE A FEW KIDS BUT IT'S NOT PERFECT AND WE STILL HAVE SOME HOMELESS FAMILIES THAT WERE CONCERNED WE JUST HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO REACH- IT'S WE'RE CONTINUOUSLY IT'S ALMOST A DAILY WEEKLY IMPROVEMENTS AND TRYING TO GET BETTER- TO CHAIRMAN SANTIAGO'S COMMENTS- WHAT WE CAN DO WITH PARENT. TRAININGS AND WORKSHOPS. WE CAN GET BETTER AND WE HAVE TO GET BETTER FAST AND PERSONALIZING AND ESPECIALLY FOR OUR MOST IMPOVERISHED PARENTS AND PARENTS. OF KIDS- YOU KNOW A SECOND LANGUAGE LEARNERS- SO THAT'S ALWAYS WEIRD WE'RE TRYING TO GET BETTER WERE MVING QUICKLY- TO THE BEST OF OUR ABILITIES BUT THERE'S A LOT OF WORK IN FRONT OF US ARE STILL IT'S NOT PERFECT AND IT'S NOT BUTTONED UP IN SOME AREAS. EVEN WHEN I SHARED THE L. A. UNIFIED WERE VERY PROBLEM WELL OUR PRINTS ARE PRINCIPALS AND ADMINISTRATORS AND TEACHERS OR HER ROLE LIKE. IN HOW WE DISTRIBUTED DEVICES TO ALMOST LIKE NINETY NINE POINT NINE INCLUDING THE HOT SPOT. BUT STILL DALY FAMILIES STILL STRUGGLE THINGS GO WRONG WITH THE HOT SPOT WE GOT TO REPLACE THEY GOT TO BRING IT IN. IT'S NOT AS SMOOTH AS WE WOULD LIKE IT'S STILL- BUT THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. THANK YOU A SUPER GENERAL FOR THAT RESPONSE AND WE SHOULD I SHOULD KNOW THAT. ALONG WITH ALL THE LOGISTICS ASSOCIATED WITH GOING A DISTANCE LEARNING IN A VERY RAPID FASHION BACK IN MARCH. LA UNIFIED OPEN PROBABLY. PROBABLY ONE OF THE WORLD'S LARGEST ESSENTIALLY SOUP KITCHENS AND THEY FED THE COMMUNITY. NOT JUST STUDENTS. AND DID THAT AND- IN A VERY EXPEDITIOUS AND EFFICIENT. AND FAIR FASHION SO CONGRATULATIONS TO. TO LA UNIFIED- IT WITH THAT I MISS COOK SILVA. I THANK YOU FOR THE PANELISTS I DO WANT TO READ SOMETHING IT IS OF MY FRIENDS TECH A FACEBOOK MESSAGE SHE'S BEEN A TEACHER AND FULLER TEN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL DISTRICT FOR. MANY MANY YEARS AND- AS I NOTED THAT THE FULLER TO ELEMENTARY SCHOOL DISTRICT AND OTHERS AN ORANGE COUNTY STARTED A HYBRID MODEL- JUST YESTERDAY SO. SHE'S CALLING- YESTERDAY HER FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH SHE'S BEEN DISTANCE LEARNING. AS OF YESTERDAY THEY STARTED BRINGING SOME STUDENTS IN THE CLASS AND THEN THEY STILL HAVE THEIR- STUDENTS WHO ARE DOING DISTANCE LEARNING SO. IT'S ABOUT THREE PARAGRAPHS BUT BUT I THINK IT PAINS OF THE PICTURE. OF WHAT A CHALLENGE IT IS BUT ALSO OF WHAT GREAT EDUCATORS WE HAVE OUT THERE WHO ARE. IN ESSENCE LEARNING ALONG WITH THE STUDENTS AND HAVING TO MAKE ACCOMMODATIONS AND WHAT THE CHALLENGES AND SOME OF THE PARENTS HAVE SEEN THAT THEMSELVES AS THEY SIT NEXT TO THEIR STUDENTS. AT HOME DOING REMOTE LEARNING. SO SHE'S THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL UPDATE WE HAVE TO TOTALLY OVER PLAN TO KEEP THIS GOING I CREATE AN ENTIRE SLIDE DECK WITH EVERYTHING I NEED THE LINK. SO I DON'T HAVE TO GO LOOKING I READ IT ALL THE ONES I HAD WORKED FOR DISTANCE LEARNING AND OF COURSE I HAD ONCE LIKE MISSING. THE RECESSED COUNTDOWN CLOCK NO WORRIES I FOUND IT EASILY. I HAVE A STUDENT THAT KEEPS A TALLY MARK OF ALL MY DAILY MISTAKES SO GETTING TEACHERS ARE LEARNING AND THINGS ARE GOING. TO GO WRONG. SO WE ALL GET A GOOD OUT OF IT. I HAVE TWO COMPUTERS AN IPAD AND A BIG SCREEN TV I ALSO HAVE A BLUETOOTH MICROPHONE THAT CONNECTS TO MY RUMORS AND BLAST OUT TO MIKE IN CLASS KIDS. I NEED TO FIGURE OUT THE SOUND THING WHEN I PLAY VIDEO IF I GO THROUGH THE COMPUTER IT IS TOO QUIET FOR THE CLASS AND IF I GO THROUGH THE TV. IT IS TOO QUIET FOR MY ZIMMER'S. HI I KNOW THERE IS A SINGLE SOLUTION THOUGH ARTEX SUPERHERO WEST CRESOL CAME OUT CRUISING THROUGH NOT ONCE BUT TWICE PERFECT TIMING. WE ALSO HAD A VISITOR AND THE KIDS IN THE CLASSROOM WERE SO EXCITED I NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GIVE EQUAL ATTENTION TO THIS RUMORS AND THE IN CLASS KIDS. ARE EIGHT P. OWNS THE BOOK I WAS TRYING TO SHOW BY VIDEO SO I'M GOING TO READ IT ALIVE TODAY HER RATE SHISA ELEMENTARY CLASSROOM TEACHER WITH K. THROUGH THREE. I LIKE THAT BETTER ANY NOW I HAVE TO CONSTANTLY REMIND US ALL OF US OF THE SIX FOOT RULE MYSELF INCLUDED I REALLY JUST WANT TO HUG THEM ALL AS ONE OF MY LITTLE DARLING SAID AT ONE POINT PARAPHRASE. IT DOESN'T MATTER IT'S JUST NICE TO BE TOGETHER AGAIN. SHE IS ABSOLUTELY CORRECT AS LONG AS WE ARE TOGETHER WE WILL MAKE. IT WORK AFTER SCHOOL WE HAD OUR FIRST SPEECH AND DEBATE TOURNAMENT TOO WHICH HAD ME WORKING UNTIL AFTER SEVEN PM. I MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE HAD AN ADULT BEVERAGE AFTER ALL OF THAT AND PASSED OUT BEFORE NINE PM LET'S SEE WHAT DAY TWO BRINGS BUT AGAIN I WANT TO THANK ALL OF THE- TEACHERS PARENTS. AND THE STUDENTS WHO WERE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER AND WE'RE LEARNING FROM ALL OF EACH ALL OF US THANK YOU. MR SANTIAGO. THANK YOU AND TAKING THE SCRIPT SO THAT THE GUY WAS HEART WARMING TO SEE THE OTHER SIDE OF IT AND NO DOUBT NO DOUBT THAT WE KNOW THE TEACHERS ARE HAVING A HARD TIME JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE. I DON'T THINK THERE'S A- AS A PERSON THE ROOM WHO WOULDN'T SAY THAT WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER BUT- BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO. RAISE BACK UP THE ISSUE THAT I TALKED ABOUT EARLIER BECAUSE WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK AT. SOME% OF THE COMMUNITIES I REPRESENT- IN THE BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT OVER AND OVER WITH EMILY. L. A. U. S. T. AREA WE HAVE THE LOWEST- SOME OF THOSE CONNECTION RATES WE ALSO HAVE TO ADMIT WHETHER RELEASED THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. BUT SOME OF THE MOST- A LOWER INCOME FOLKS WHAT WITHIN THE AREAS OF NOT BEING CONNECTED. IN SOME OF THE CHALLENGES WHEN IT COMES TO ENGLISH- IS A SECOND LANGUAGE- IN THE ABILITY TO HAVE. A SPACE- TO DO THE WORK- THIS TOO REQUIRES- IN SEOUL. I GUESS MY QUESTION BECOMES. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING TO. CREATE THOSE PASSED BY TEAM FOR THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS. THAT ARE WOEFULLY BEHIND. AND NEED THAT SORT OF HELP BECAUSE- I. I APPRECIATE THE GOOD WORK THAT HAS BEEN DONE. BUT WHEN WE TALKED OUR CONSTITUENTS- THE GOOD WORK THAT HAS BEEN DONE HASN'T ARRIVED ALL THE NEIGHBORHOODS AND SOME OF THE NEIGHBORS I REPRESENT ARE SOME OF THOSE THAT ARE LEFT BEHIND- AND I'D LIKE TO MAYBE PULL THAT YOU'RE NOT ANSWER NOW BUT I WANT TO POSE THAT QUESTION THANK WHICH AND I POSED THE PAST THAT WE KNOW ALL THESE THINGS ARE OUT THERE. WHAT SORT OF INVESTMENTS. ARE GONNA BE DONE IMMEDIATELY WITHIN THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS. BECAUSE IT'S ALMOST EIGHT MONTHS LATER- AND- WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE BEGINNING BUT EIGHT MONTHS LATER WE KNOW AND. I MEAN I I'M WERE COMMITTEE HEARINGS I HAVEN'T FILLED FROM BEING A MORE TEMPERED MY LANGUAGE AND I AND I UNDERSTAND THE CHALLENGES BEFORE US AB BUT WHEN WE TALK TO OUR CONSTITUENTS. AND WE CAN'T WAIT ANOTHER DAY. I TELL THESE BEGIN TO CUT BILL THAT SORT OF SENSE OF URGENCY AND I KNOW IT'S THERE I KNOW IT'S THERE WE WANT TO PARTNER WITH YOU. SO ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT WE CAN. WE CAN WORK ON THAT TO GET THOSE AREAS ADAPTIVE YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE FOR EXAMPLE THE PAPER- ONE OF PRIME. HELLO SORRY MY MASK IT'S GOOD STUFF ANYMORE A PRIVATE PAPERS WITH. OUR REGION THE ONLY TIME. WHEN EVER. A STORY ARISES ABOUT THE- THE INCOME INEQUALITIES IN. AS EARLY AND THE DIGITAL DIVIDE US AS IT RELATES TO EDUCATION. MOST OF THE COUPLE KISSED. ON THE SIDE. FIVE MONTHS LATER. HOW REGULAR STRIKE AT THIS. WITH THAT SORT. WITH THAT SORT OF URGENCY. D. EASE I THINK YOU'RE MUTED SURE THERE WE GO YOU'RE ON YOUR ON THE GO FOR SURE. YES THANK YOU ARE CHAIRMAN SANTIAGO. NO APPS ABSOLUTELY. WE HAVE TO MOVE QUICK AND IT HAS TO BE URGENT- OUR SUPERINTENDENT AUSTIN BEAUTY AND HER DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT MEGAN REILLY HAVE CALLED A TASK FORCE IT'S A SEXUALLY- A STRATEGIC PLAN THAT WE'RE WORKING ON RIGHT NOW. WE'RE MOVING QUICKLY ON IT TO GO TO THE NEXT STEPS ABOUT BEING EVEN MORE PRECISE OVER COMMUNICATING THE RESOURCES BUT BEING MORE PRECISE KNOWING LIKE THE BACK OF OUR HANDS WHICH OF THE FAMILY STILL STRUGGLE BECAUSE AS I MENTIONED WE'VE WE'VE DONE A GOOD JOB OF GETTING DEVICES AND INTERNET AND- AND THAT BUT WE STILL KNOW YOU KNOW DALY THAT FAMILIES AND OUR MOST IMPOVERISHED AREAS- STILL STRUGGLE SO. WE HAVE A- WE DO HAVE A TIGER TEAM RIGHT NOW IN A STRATEGIC PLAN. I WILL SAY- IN MY IN MY COMMENTS THE IMPORTANT OF. THE LONG TERM WE HAVE TO RE FRESH OR DEVICES. SO OUR KIDS SOME OF THE DEVICES RIGHT NOW THEY'RE A ITTLE BIT OUTDATED YEAH THEY HAVE WITH THEIR UPDATED BUT WE- WE FILL IN LA UNIFIED THAT WE HAVE TO REPLENISH 20% OF OUR DEVICES PER YEAR SO OVER THE COURSE OF FIVE YEARS. YOU KNOW EVERY KID HAS AN UP TO BE A DEVICE- WE STILL HAVE TO GET A LITTLE BIT SMARTER WIND. THE HOT SPOTS OR BREAKING DOWN WHAT AREAS KNOWING THAT DATA AND THEN DOING SOMETHING ABOUT IT- SO PART OF OUR STRATEGIC PLAN RIGHT NOW WE DO HAVE. IT THE SUPPORT. BUT WE'RE RE THINKING HOW WE STRUCTURE IT. HOW WE DIFFERENTIATE THAT THE SPORT THE SUPPORT. BASED ON- THE MOST IMPOVERISHED AREAS SO IN OTHER WORDS WE BELIEVE IN EQUITY JUST LIKE L. THE ALL CAPS SPIRIT. THE COMMUNITIES AND THE FAMILIES AND THE STUDENTS WITH THE MOST NEEDS GET THE MOST RECENT RESOURCES. THE FASTEST. SO I DON. WE ARE WE'RE WE'RE MOVING HARD ON THAT AND WE'RE WE KNOW THAT THEY'RE STILL WORK OUT AND IN FRONT OF IT AND WE'RE MOVING AS FAST AS WE CAN WE'RE JUST NOT THERE YET. THANK YOU SUPERINTENDENT. ROMERO AND I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT LA UNIFIED AND REALLY. JUST ABOUT EVERY SCHOOL DISTRICT ACROSS THE STATE FOR THE WORK THAT THEY'VE DONE SYSTEMS PANDEMIC BROKE OUT. IN THE ARENA OF LIMITED RESOURCES. YOU'RE FEEDING PEOPLE. YOUR PROVIDING COMPUTERS YOU'RE PROVIDING INSTRUCTION. YOU'RE DOING THE BEST YOU CAN AGAIN WITH VERY LIMITED RESOURCES IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC SCHOOLS ARE BEING ASKED TO DO. MORE THAN WE EVER ASKTHEM TO DO IN SCHOOLS QUITE FRANKLY ARE ASKED TO DO TOO MUCH WITH THE LIMITED RESOURCES THEY HAVE SO IT'S TIME FOR THE STATE. IN THIS ROOM INCLUDED A STEP UP TO THE PLATE GIVE YOU THE RESOURCES YOUNEED. TO SERVE THE COMMUNITY PEOPLE THE WAY PEOPLE WANT YOU TO SERVE THE COMMUNITY- WHICH IS- YOU KNOW. A MUCH MORE EXPANSIVE VERSION OF SERVING THE COMMUNITY THEN WE HAD EVEN TWENTY YEARS AGO SO IF WE'RE GOING TO REQUEST SAID OF YOU. WE SHOULD PROVIDE YOU THE RESOURCES TO DO IT. IN A VERY CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT SO WITH THAT I THANK THE PANEL FOR THEIR PARTICIPATION PANEL NUMBER TWO RUNNING ON A PANEL NUMBER THREE. WHICH IS A MISTER SANTIAGO IS GOING TO INTRODUCE THAT PANEL. IF IT'S OKAY WITH THE COMMITTEE MISTY SITTING DOWN MOST OF TIME. THANK THANK YOU MR- BUT I CERTAINLY LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THIS WORK OUT WITH YOU- OVER THE NEXT YEAR HOW LONG IT TAKES THE BRING IT COULD BE SOME IS COMMUNITY HAVE BEEN LEFT BEHIND. I LIKE THE ONE I REPRESENT. OUR FIRST- THANK. OUR PANEL BE ABLE TALK ABOUT DIMINISHES IN INDUSTRY AND LOCAL AND- ENTITIES- THAT THE AND WHAT THEY'VE DONE TO HELP STUDENTS IN GETTING INTERNET ACCESS. I WAS JUST REMINDER HOW THAT WILL BE HOLDING QUESTIONS UNTIL THE END OF THE PANEL JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT WE EXPEDITE. OTHER PRESENTATIONS A WILL WILL CONTINUE TO ASK. OTHER PRESENTERS TO STAY THEIR TIME- ALLOCATED AS BRIEFED BEFORE- BEFORE A- AND BRIEF IN PREPARATION OF THE. THE HEARING OUR FIRST US SPEAKER IS- MISTER CARLSON WITH CTIA THE WIRELESS INDUSTRY WILL BE JOINING US BY PHONE- YOU MAY BEGIN AND WELCOME. I GOT YOUR DONALD AND MEMBERS OF A BOOK COMMITTEE CARLTON OPPORTUNITY I A- THE WIRELESS INDUSTRY- WE ARE DEFINITELY LIVING AN UNPRECEDENTED TIME SINCE WE'VE BEEN HEARING ALL- ALL DAY- THE PANDEMIC OF PROMPTED SUDDEN AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN HOW WE LIVE WORK AND EDUCATE OUR KIDS. AND WE BELIEVE AMERICANS WIRELESS NETWORKS HAVE RISEN TO THE CHALLENGE- HAILING RECORD SEARCHES THE MOBILE VOICE AND DATA TRAFFIC DRIVEN BY COBIT. THE SUCCESSES NO ACTION OUR NETWORKS MET THE CHALLENGES THANKS TO THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THE INDUSTRY AND BETH ANNUALLY TO BUILD SOME OF THE WORLD'S MOST BILLION THAT WORKS WITH BOTH A LONG STANDING NATIONAL REGULATORY FRAMEWORK. THAT PROMOTES COMPETITION INVESTMENT. LAST YEAR'S WIRELESS INDUSTRY INVESTMENT TOTALED TWENTY NINE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS A FOUR YEAR HIGH. BUT WE HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER COLLABORATIVELY TO BRIDGE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE TO EXPAND OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL AMERICANS. LET ME SHARE WITH ME SOME OF THE SOME OF THE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ARE CARRIED HAVE BEEN DOING AND WORKING- WORKING ON THIS ISSUE WITH EDUCATION. AT&amp;T FOR EXAMPLE DONATED ELEVEN THOUSAND WIRELESS HOT SPOT TO THE CORRECT BAROCLINIC SANTA CLARA COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION. AND THE SAN JOSE PUBLIC LIBRARY SYSTEM. PROVIDED SCHOOL ON WHEELS BUT CAPITA FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTION TO HELP SUPPORT THIS IS AN ONLINE LEARNING FOR ALMOST TWO IN LA. KEEP UP WITH SACRAMENTO REGIONAL TRANSIT AGENCIES TO EQUIP BUSES WITH WIFI DOG BED IS. BRIGHTEN YOUR RECORDS TO PRETEND AMERIGO THEY WORK WITH THE GOVERNOR AND THE FIRST PARTNER IN A CROSS SECTOR PARTNERSHIPS TO EXPAND THEIR L. A. U. S. B. AGREEMENT FOR THE BRIDGE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. BY COMMITTING UNLIMITED INTERNET ACTIVITY FOR UP TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND ADDITIONAL UNDERSERVED STUDENTS. ARE THERE ANY INNOVATIVE LEARNING TOOLS INITIATIVE DEMONSTRATES THEIR COMMITMENT TO REDUCING THE BARRIERS- FORTY EIGHT TITLE ONE MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOLS PARTICIPATING IN THIS PROGRAM REACHING MORE THAN FORTY FOUR THOUSAND STUDENTS. MOST RECENTLY ANNOUNCED THE EXPANSION OF AVAILABILITY FOR THEIR NEW FIXED WIRELESS BROADBAND SERVICE CALLED LP HOME INTERNET CUSTOMERS CAN WORK STUDY OR HOMES WITH THEIR KIDS. HE MOBILE AS YOU WOULD YOU WOULD HEARD FROM- SUPERINTENDENT THURMAN EARLIER PARTNERED WITH APPLE THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. THREE TWO MILLION CALIFORNIA STUDENTS BY PROVIDING SPECIAL PRICING FOR IPAD THAN ON LIMITED DATA PRINCE I WAS TWELVE DOLLARS PER MONTH. A LARGE. TEN MILLION IN SEPTEMBER BUT TO OVER FIVE YEARS THAT A TEN POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR NATIONAL PROGRAM FOR UNDERSERVED ELIGIBLE STUDENT HOUSEHOLDS. WILL HELP CLOSE THE HOMEWORK GAP BY PROVIDING FREE HOT SPOT SIMPLY HIGH SPEED DATA. ALONG WITH ACCESS TO LAPTOPS AND TABLETS TO COST. PART OF THE GLOBAL- EARLY IN THE CONFLICT PRICES TO DONATE NEARLY A HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND HOTSPOTS IN THIRTEEN THOUSAND TABLETS THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION FOR DISTRIBUTION THROUGHOUT THE STATE. IT WAS RECOGNIZED BY GOVERNOR NEWSOM AS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THE CROSS SECTOR PARTNERSHIPS. AT SCHOOLS AROUND THE COUNTRY WERE TO MITIGATE THE RISK OF CORONAVIRUS WE'RE PROUD TO SEE BY LET'S PROVIDERS QUICKLY STEPPING UP TO MAKE SURE HOME DOWN CHILDREN HAVE THE TOOLS THEY NEED TO PARTICIPATE AND DISTANCE LEARNING. AND STAY ENGAGED. COOL TEACHERS AND PARENTS ARE WORKING HARD AND THERE ARE A LOT OF CHALLENGES AS WE'VE BEEN HEARING ALL THAT. WHILE DENTISTRY CONNECTS MILLIONS OF KIDS EVERY DAY AND ALMOST ONE IN FIVE HOUSEHOLDS THE ONLY INTERNET CONNECTION THE SPARK FROM. IN JUST THE PAST FEW WEEKS THE SCHOOLS OF SCHOOLS OF OPEN WIRELESS INDUSTRY GETS CONNECTED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS FOR THE FIRST TIME. WE UNDERSTAND MANY STUDENTS ARE RELYING ON THEIR BROADBAND CONNECTED TO LEARN OUR TOP JOB KEEPING THOSE THAT BRIDGE RUNNING. IN ADDITION TO KEEPING UP AS THE SURGING DEMANDS DURING COVER A DISTANCE LEARNING AND WORKING FROM HOME AS YOU KNOW WE ARE WORKING. WE'RE DEALING WITH ON PRESENT AND UNPRECEDENTED WILDFIRES AND PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFFS AS WE SPEAK AROUND THE STATE. I WANTED TO- REFLECT ON- A COMMENT THAT SUPERINTENDENT THURMOND. MADE ABOUT THE NEED FOR INFRASTRUCTURE I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT- CAN COME OUT OF THIS HEARING IS TO LOOK AT MAYBE FURTHER COLLABORATION BETWEEN. THE EDUCATION COMMITTEE. AND THE WIRELESS INDUSTRY AS WE ATTEMPT TO FURTHER BUILD OUT OF INFRASTRUCTURE INCLUDING THE FIVE G. INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH IS FOCUSED DIRECTLY ON THE CAPACITY ISSUES. THAT ARE CREATING THE ISSUES SO- AS WE GO FURTHER WOULD LIKE MAYBE TO FOR THOSE CONVERSATIONS OF WHEN WE UNFORTUNATELY. AND HAVE A AN ISSUE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WHAT WE OFTEN DO MAYBE SOME NEW A NONTRADITIONAL VOICES CAN BE PART OF THAT. WHAT WE'RE WORKING AROUND THE CLOCK TO KEEP OUR NETWORKS GOING AND WE TAKE THAT RESPONSIBILITY VERY SERIOUSLY. THANK YOU. SHARES. THANK YOU MISSED CALLS AND NOW WE HAVE MISS MCINTYRE THE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA CABLE AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS ASSOCIATION WHO IS ALSO A JOINING US BY PHONE. WELCOME. MAYBE THE MODERATOR COULD CHECK AND IF YOU STILL CONNECTED WE'RE HAVING TECHNICAL ISSUES ON THE PHONE EARLIER I WAS ADVISED THAT MAY STILL BE THE CASE. HELLO HELLO WE CAN HEAR YOU NOW. OKAY THANK YOU I'M CAROLYN MCINTYRE IN BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CABLE AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS ASSOCIATION I HAVE FOR THOSE MEMBERS THAT THAT MAY NOT BE ACTED FOR MIGLIOR WITH OUR INDUSTRY CCPA THE TRADE ASSOCIATION- FOR THE CABLE INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS AND BOTH COMPANIES HAVE COLLECTIVELY INVESTED OVER FORTY BILLION DOLLARS IN THE STATE TO DEPLOY BROADBAND NETWORKS DAM IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- I JUST LIKE TO SAY FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU FOR GIVING US AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY- I WILL START MY COMMENTS BY SIMPLY HIGHLIGHTING. THAT EARLY ON- IT SOON ADDS THAT PANDEMIC I'VE HAD AND THE STATE DID NOT MUCH OF THE COUNTRY WHEN INTO A SHELTER IN PLACE MODE THE CABLE INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS IMMEDIATELY STEPPED UP AND KEPT THE CONNECT AMERICA PLEDGE- THAT PLAGUED WITH DESIGNED TO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE WERE FAMILY THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE FACING A FINANCIAL CHALLENGES AND WE WERE DOING BUT WE COULD IN ORDER TO HELP KEEP YOUR SERVICES UP AND RUNNING. BUT TODAY'S FOCUS HAS BEEN A LOT ON THOSE POPULATIONS THAT DON'T HAVE CONNECTIVITY'S SO IF I COULD SPEAK TO SOME OF THE SERVICE OFFERINGS THAT ARE MEMBERS AND HAVE PUT IN PLACE AND- ORACLE AND OR HAVE EXPANDED- IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT POPULATIONS THAT LACK CONNECTIVITY ARE ABLE TO BE CONNECTED. MOST OF THE CCPA MEMBER COMPANIES OFFER PROGRAMS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO CONNECT LOW INCOME FAMILIES THAT DON'T OTHERWISE HAVE AN INTERNET CONNECTION WE HAVE I HAVE SOME OF THESE PLACES ARE PROGRAMS IN PLACE AND FOURTH LONG AT FAR BACK AS TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT BOTH PROGRAMS RANGE IN PRICE FROM NINE NINETY FIVE TO SEVENTEEN NINETY NINE AND THE GENERAL ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA. IS THAT THERE IS A MEMBER THE C. THAT IS THE CASE YOU'RE AND TO CALL FOR THE FREE EVERY LUNCH PROGRAM FOR AND THAT THERE TYPE OF CELLS SERVICE PRO. AT I MEN HAVE WORKED DALY. IN THE QUEUE WITH THEIR COMMUNITY. IN AN ATTEMPT TO IDENTIFY THE POPULATIONS THAT WOULD QUALIFY FOR THESE PROGRAMS BUT I WILL LET MEANT THAT HISTORICALLY THERE HAVE BEEN SOME CHALLENGES WE BELIEVE THAT OUR GREATEST- AB PARTNER. TO IDENTIFY THESE POPULATIONS SHOULD IN FACT BE THE SCHOOLS- PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC THAT HAD BEEN A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE IN THAT. SCHOOLS WERE NOT ALWAYS COMFORTABLE WORKING WITH THAT COMPANY IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY THOSE POPULATIONS THAT WOULD QUALIFY FOR THE PROGRAM. SINCE THAT TIME AND THERE HAVE BEEN SOME PRETTY AMAZING PARTNERSHIP THE COUPLE OF EXAMPLES EXIST ABOUT THAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA ONE HERE IN SACRAMENTO WHERE CONTACTED ENTERED INTO. AN AGREEMENT WITH THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO AND THE SACRAMENTO CITY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT- TO PROVIDE SERVICE PADILLA TO A SPONSORED AGREE MATT I'LL RETURN TO THAT HERE IN A MOMENT. AND ANOTHER EXAMPLE WOULD BE BE AT **** COMMUNICATIONS PARTNERSHIP IN THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO WITH THE SAN DIEGO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT- HAVING WORKED WITH THEM IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY THE POPULATION. THAT WOULD QUALIFY FOR THESE PROGRAMS AND TO GET THOSE INDIVIDUALS CONNECTED- I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SPEAK A MOMENT ABOUT WHAT WE CALL SPONSORED PROGRAM IN GENERAL- MORE SPECIFICALLY ABOUT A PARTNERSHIP THAT WAS RECENTLY ANNOUNCED BETWEEN. THE AT THE NATIONALCABLE AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS ASSOCIATION AND THE EDUCATION SUPERHIGHWAY- THEY HAVE BASICALLY ENTERED INTO AN. AGREEMENT TO SELL ITS HEY THE KATE THREE TWELVE TO BRIBE. INITIATIVE THAT ADMISSION AND A PART. WITH WILLING GETS. TO WORK WITH THE INTERNET PROVIDERS TO IDENTIFY THE PA. THAT DO NOT HAVE CONNECTIVITY AND THAT THE SCHOOL WOULD BE WILLING TO ENTER INTO A CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENT IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THOSE POPULATIONS RECEIVE SERVICE- AND THERE ARE EXAMPLES ADD SPONSORED PROGRAMS WORKING- THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY- THE CITY OF CHICAGO ACTUALLY HAS SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT. IN PLACE TO PROVIDE CONNECTIVITY FOR MANY AND THEIR- POPULATION CAN'T SPEAK TO DIRECTLY WITH THE QUALIFYING CRITERIA IS FOR THAT BUT THESE ARE CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENTS THAT CAN BE ENTERED INTO. WITH AN INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER TO PROVIDE SERVICES FOR THAT POPULATION THAT THE- THE PARTNER THE CHOOSES TO PROVIDE SERVICE FOR- SO THAT IS AN INITIATIVE THAT WAS RECENTLY IMPLEMENTED AND WE'RE HOPING TO HAVE BEEN VERY. POSITIVE OUT AND- REPORTED I HERE IN THE NEAR FUTURE THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK ABOUT THE CHALLENGES THAT SOME COMMUNITIES CONTINUE TO HAVE BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF INFRASTRUCTURE. AND THE FACT THAT THERE'S A LOT OF HOT SPOTS THAT ARE BEING PROVIDED IN ORDER TO FILL THIS GAP FIRST I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT HOT SPOTS DON'T WORK IF THERE'S NO NETWORK FOR THEM TO CONNECT TO. THE BROADBAND DEPLOYMENT AND- DEPLOYMENT OF BROKEBACK INFRASTRUCTURE IS IN FACT KEY I MENTIONING BROADBAND DEPLOYMENT BECAUSE AS HE PRETENDED THURMAN MENTIONED EARLIER. MANY OF THE PROBLEMS WITH DEPLOYING BROADBAND INTERMITTENTLY ARE RELATED TO OUR INABILITY. TO OBTAIN PERMIT OR TO OVERCOME CHALLENGES WITH THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT AID THAT ARE LOOKING TO REACH THE COMPANIES TO PROVIDE THAT SIMPLY EITHER DELAYED PROJECT OR OTHERWISE MAKES IMPACT PROHIBITED. SO THERE ARE A LOT OF ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE A DRASTIC- IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT WHEN WE HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND THEN ONCE THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS IN PLACE TO WORK TO IDENTIFY AND CONNECT THOSE POPULATIONS. THAT DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE CONNECTIVITY. THAT HAPPY TO BE MARKS THE FIFTH ABOUT ANY OTHER PROGRAMS THAT THERE'S ANY QUESTION. THANK YOU MS MCINTYRE NOW WE'RE MOVING ON TO. WORK AND I WANT TO INVITE I HOPE YOU STILL ON IS THE HONORABLY SOLEIL HO WHO SERVED HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE BUT NOW. I WILL BE PRESENTED TODAY- AWARENESS OTHER HALF WHICH IS THE EXECUTIVE BOARD MEMBER FOR THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES. AND ALSO MONTEREY COUNTY SUPERVISOR HE'S COULD BE JOINING US BY PHONE AND TALKING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. ABOUT INTERNET ACCESS AND SOME OF THE LOCAL INITIATIVES- MISTER LEE HOW ARE YOU ONE. THANK YOU I AM ON A CHURCH SANTIAGO AND I WANT TO COMMEND YOU AND CHERYL DONALD AND ALL MY- FORMER COLLEAGUES AND YOU MEMBERS. OF THE HOLDING OUT MUCH NEEDED HEARING ON THE CRITICAL. THAT MERITED BY RELIGIOUS AND A GOVERNOR NOW MORE THAN EVER AND I HOPE THAT IT WILL BE A- FOR ACTION IN THE NEXT LEGISLATIVE SESSION I WILL HAVE TO BE AFTER THIS I'M HERE AND SO OF THE WELL WE TO. WITH AMERICAN LEAK WRITERS MY FATHER PASSED AWAY. RECENTLY AND WAIT TO ESCORT. BODY OFTEN THE AIRPORT BACK HOME TO WATCH THE BILL BUT I JUST TO COME THAT AS AS YOU ALREADY KNOW THE DIGITAL BY HAD BEFORE TOO LONG AND FRANKLY. IT'S A NATIONAL EMBARRASSED HERE THE TECH OF THE WORLD OUR CANNOT BE BETTER TELL. BUT I THOUGHT THE HARD FOR TO GIRLS THIRTY FIVE ADDRESS. IN MY JUST ANY SO. CHAPTER THIS TO SO MANY OF OUR SKINNER ACROSS STATE AND THE NATION BUT AS YOU KNOW AND AS THE SUPPORT MENTION IN JULY THE- PERMITTED HAD A S. ONE POINT TWO MIL. OR TWENTY PER OF ALL STUDENTS WILL NOT HAVE BEEN. AND OUR STATE TO BURKE. THURMOND HAS CERTAINLY DONE LOT OF HARD WORK BUT THE CHARGE THE CHALLENGES ON WE STILL BIG THAT SO MUCH MORE MUCH BE DONE. BUT THE AS WE KNOW IT IS WORST FOR COMMUNITY OF COLOR RURAL AREAS AND THE WAY NEIGHBORS. 33% OF WHAT HOW HAVE. COMPARED SEVENTY EIGHT AND URBAN AREAS BUT WE ARE KNOW THAT YOU IN PLACE LIKE LOS. AND OAKLAND THERE BIG GUY AMONG LOW INCOME AND ABLE TO CALL THEIR LACK HIS. JOB ALREADY KNEW THAT THE WAS GONNA BE CROWD WITH THE SCHOOL YEAR WITH MIXED. WITH ONLINE. THE INTERNET IS NOT A LUXURY MORE IT IS NOT A NECESSITY OF EVERYDAY LIFE AND MUST BE USED AS A MISTER UTILITY JUST LIKE WATER ELECTRICITY OR GAS. WE KNOW OUR STUDENTS WILL NEED IT BEYOND THE PANDEMIC BUT SO WILL THE MILLIONS OF WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA FOR THEIR JOBS. AND OUR JUNIOR OR ACTIVITY TELEHEALTH MORE AND CONNECTING WITH THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS USING THE TECHNOLOGY SO IT'S CRITICAL FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS OF ALL AGES AND ALL BACKGROUNDS AND ALL CORNERS OF OUR STATE. BUT THE QUESTION TODAY MUST BE POPULOUS STATE PARTNER WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS INCLUDING COUNTIES CITIES AND SCHOOL BOARDS TO ADDRESS THE DIGITAL DIVIDE ONCE AND FOR ALL IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE WE ARE YOUR BEST PARTNERS. ALL CALIFORNIA'S GOT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SHOULD BE LEADING BY DEMANDING THAT ALL PROVIDERS IN THE RESPECTIVE COUNTIES PARTICIPATING PROGRAMS THAT CALIFORNIA LIFELINE THAT'S RECENTLY BEEN EXPANDED- IT IS. CURRENTLY VOLUNTARY BILL FOR PROVIDERS TO PARTICIPATE AND THERE'S ALSO A NEED FOR SIMILAR LIKE GRANT PROGRAM FOR CABLE PROVIDERS THERE ALSO TENDS OF THOUSANDS OF RESIDENTS IN EACH OF EACH REGION IN OUR STATE WHO QUALIFY BUT ARE NOT YET BENEFITING. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CAN BE USING ITS RESOURCES TO EDUCATE LOCAL RESIDENTS AND CREATE PARTNERSHIPS WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO GET THE WORD OUT TO ROLE MORE RESIDENTS INTO THE- CRITICAL PROGRAMS. WE ALSO NEED TO REFORM EXPAND OUR EXISTING STATE PROGRAM THAT LIKE THAT BACK TO RESERVE FUND TO GENERATE MORE A GENERATE MORE CONTINUOUS FUNDING. AND EXPAND MORE BROADBAND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SHOULD NOT HAVE TO WAIT ON THE SIDELINES WHAT PROVIDERS ARE DOING THE FIRST RIGHT OF REFUSAL FOR STATE MONEY TO EXPAND INFRASTRUCTURE. WE KNOW THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS- TWENTY SUPERINTENDED BERMAN POINTED OUT LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND TRYING TO LISTEN TO LEAD EFFORTS TO ADDRESS THE DIGITAL DIVIDE MORE TRADITIONALLY EXPEDITIOUSLY WITH PERMITTING AND ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW. IN FACT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED AND INCENTIVIZED TO PARTNER WITH SCHOOL DISTRICTS CITIES AND. COUNTIES FORMING JPA A OR SCHERING PLOUGH COST LOCAL GOVERNMENTS MUST BE IN. TO IN THE DRY SEAT. ANTOLINI JUST A FEW WEEKS WE HAD OUR FIRST MEETING WITH ALL HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICTS THE CITY IS TO AND COUNTY MY- TO BE GRANTED PARTNERSHIP TO MANAGE THE DIGITAL. IN THE LARGEST IN THE MONTEREY BAY READ. THERE'S INTEREST YOUR PARTNER THAT WE HAD NOT PREVIOUS WITNESSED BUT THERE IS INTRA COLLABORATIVELY ALL THIS. AS WELL. BUT TODAY I ALSO WANT TO PUT. AT THIS BEEN ON. THAT WE TRULY NEED A UNIVERSAL. FIBER FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY TO BALLOT TO ADDRESS THE DEADLY BY LOOKING FOR IN CALIFORNIA IF WE ARE SERIOUS WE NEED TO ADVANCE THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS NEEDED. TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM AND THEN ALLOW LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO LEAD THE WAY THERE'S BIPARTISAN INTEREST IN COUNTY ALL ACROSS THE STATE INCLUDING A RURAL SUBURBAN AND URBAN AREAS. BUT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES THE LEGAL CITIES THE RURAL COUNTIES RT RT THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BOARDS SIX INCHES ALL GET BEHIND. SEPARATELY THE STATE CAN ALSO SUPPORT MUNICIPAL BOND MUSIC MUNICIPAL BOND FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO UTILIZE AS WELL AS ANOTHER TOOL IN OUR TOOLBOX. OUR STUDENTS CERTAINLY DESERVE IT AND EVERY CALIFORNIAN DESERVES TO HAVE PORTABLE INTERNET ACCESS MOBILE INTERNET ACCESS IN THEIR HOMES LET'S MAKE IT HAPPEN NOW I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME- MEMBERS AND- APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING AND THAT IS AHEAD OF US THANKS. THE NEW KNOW WE I'M GONNA IN SEPTEMBER MY OWN RULE BECAUSE MEMBER OF. HAVE TO LEAVE IT IN AND- MISCARRIAGE YOU STILL HAVE A CRUSH. ONE TIME I'M GOING TO DO THIS BUT THE AND I APPRECIATE- ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF THE H I RECALL HIM- AND AGAIN MY CONDOLENCES TO YOUR FAMILY- SO WHAT DO YOU THINK IS- WHAT DO YOU THINK THE DIGITAL BY CONTINUES TO PERSIST IN OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES WHY IS A CONTINUING HAPPENING. I BELIEVE RUN OUT WE HAVE WELL INTENDED STATE PROGRAMS AND I'VE BEEN TALKING TO MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. THAT EVEN WITH THOSE PROGRAMS THAT GENERATE A FEW HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR IT IS SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH THE FUNDING THAT WE HAD TO GET TWO MONTHS AGO- IS ALREADY DRIED UP BY THE END OF THIS ARE. YOU DONE. I WONDER YEAR AND- AND THEY HAVE MANY MORE APPLICATIONS THAT THEY SIMPLY CANNOT FUND. BUT BUT ALSO AS WE KNOW IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT- ONE OUT WE LOOK INTO THAT THE PC PROGRAMS IT WAS SURPRISED TO FIND OUT THAT- WHEN. IF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WANTED TO PARTNER. AND UNIVERSAL BROAD. JUST LIKE SMALL. LIKE IN MY COUNTY THE DOLLAR SHE- IT THOUSAND READ YOU KNOW INTERNET OR- FOR ALL OF THE THREAT. BUT IT TOOK HIM. YEARS TO GETTHROUGH THE- AND THE PERMITTING. AND IT WAS ALSO A SURPRISE AND FIND OUT THAT IF YOU WANT TO GET SOME OF THE BIG MONEY. THAT DAY I HAVE TEAM- HAPPY RECLINE EXPANDING- OF THOSE PROJECTS AND INFRASTRUCTURE IN BOTH RURAL AREAS. BEFORE WE CAN APPLY TO GET THAT MONEY SO THERE'S A VERY REAL- BUREAUCRATIC. AND PERMITTING CHALLENGES THAT I THINK WILL REALLY HELP. BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT- IF WE REALLY. WANTED TO MAKE ACOSTA SPECIALLY IN THE IN THE WORLD AREAS WE NEED- A LOT MORE MONEY. TO REALLY DO THE MAJOR INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS THAT ARE NEEDED. AND TALKING TO SOME OF MY REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES IN THE WORLD COUNTY. NORTON WITH A CALIFORNIA BIG BIG BIG THIS IS ONE OF THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE. THAT THEY MAY GET ASKED ABOUT- AND EVEN AFTER THE RESIDENTS HAVE BEEN ASKING FOR SO MANY YEARS NOW. THAT I THINK THAT IF THE TIMING IS RIGHT THE- DEPEND THAT MAKE HIGHLIGHTED THE NEED THERE. BUT IT REALLY CALL FOR ACTION AT THE MANY DIFFERENT WAYS AND MANY DIFFERENT STRATEGIES. BUT I THINK THE BIGGEST IS HAVING THE MONEY UP FRONT IT- TO GET THE WORK DONE AND MOVE THESE PROJECTS. FORWARD AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. THANK YOU. ALEJO'S I'M GONNA CAN. TO THE PANEL AND SIR WE'RE WE'RE VERY SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS. OFFER A- AND PRAYERS TO YOU IN YOUR- AND THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE- BIGGEST. DESPITE THE GUN DO THAT THANK YOU I'M- ONLY THEY CAN TO TRY TO RECOMMIT MYSELF THE WHAT WE'RE AT- I'M GONNA MOVE ON. TO MISTER FINLEY MR FENNEL APOLOGIZES SUPERINTEND OF SCHOOL FOR IMPERIAL COUNTY. I THANK YOU MR OFTEN OFFER JOINING US VIA REMOTE VIDEO TESTIMONY AND IMPERIAL COUNTY THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I APPRECIATE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE TODAY- AND THESE VERY IMPORTANT CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE DIGITAL DIVIDE BOTH FOR OUR FAMILIES AND FOR OUR STUDENTS. IMAGINE THE POSSIBILITIES IF YOU WILL OF ALL STUDENTS WERE ABLE TO USE DIGITAL RESOURCES- ADVANCING THEIR EDUCATION WELL BEYOND THE SCHOOL HOURS. IMAGINE IF TEACHERS WERE ABLE TO ASSIGN PROJECTS THAT REQUIRE RICH INVESTIGATION AN ONLINE RESEARCH WITHOUT WORRY OF STUDENTS WHO MAY BE DISADVANTAGED DUE TO THEIR LACK OF INTERNET CONNECTION AT HOME IMAGINE BACKPACKS WITHOUT TEXTBOOKS REPLACE THE DEVICES AND THAT PROVIDE STUDENTS ANYTIME ANYWHERE ACCESS TO NOT ONLY INTERACTIVE BUT ADAPTIVE CURRICULUM WELL THIS IS OUR VISION. AND THE IMPORTANCE OF WHICH IS REALLY BEEN MAGNIFIED- DUE TO THE CURRENT PANDEMIC AND THE NEED TO SUPPORT RICH ROBUST DISTANCE LEARNING FOR ALL STUDENTS MY NAME IS TODD FOR NOW AND I AM VERY PROUD TO SERVE AS COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS FOR IMPERIAL COUNTY. I'D LIKE TO SHARE A LITTLE BIT OF BRIEF BACKGROUND- TO HELP FRAME THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING AND IMPERIAL COUNTY IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX THE INTERNET WAS DRIVING FIBER INSTALLATIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY AS WE ALL KNOW. WELL IMPERIAL COUNTY BEING SITUATED BETWEEN PHOENIX AND SAN DIEGO- WE WERE SEEN COMPANIES AND CARRIERS PULL PERMITS TO- INSTALL FIBER REPEAT THEIR SIGNALS BUT WE SAW VERY FEW PLANS FOR HOW THEY WILL PUT WERE INTENDING TO PROVIDE SERVICE FOR OUR COMMUNITY. SEEN THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE AND WANTING TO BE IN CONTROL OF BOTH OUR CURRENT AND FUTURE NEEDS WE BEGAN DEVELOPING PLANS TO BUILD OUR OWN. PUBLIC FIBER COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK THROUGHOUT AND COUNTY WE BEGAN CONNECTING SEVEN COMPREHENSIVE HIGH SCHOOLS WITH OUR OWN SELF PROVISION PRIVATE FIBER NETWORK AND BEGAN DEVELOPING AND EMERGING. AT MERGING DISTANCE LEARNING PROGRAM. BY TWO THOUSAND ONE WE HAD FORMED A PUBLIC JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY THAT NOW INCLUDES AND I'M VERY PROUD TO SAY THIS ALL SIX SEVENTEEN SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND IMPERIAL COUNTY ALL COUNTY AND MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENTS INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION AND OUR HEALTHCARE AND HOSPITAL FACILITIES. ENTER THIS PUBLIC JPA NOW MANAGES AND OPERATES OVER TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY MILES OF OUR OWN FIBER SERVING A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE SITES THROUGHOUT IMPERIAL COUNTY. SO AFTER SUCCESSFULLY BUILDING OUT THIS FIBER INFRASTRUCTURE TO CONTROL OUR OWN FUTURE WE SET OUR SIGHTS ON BUILDING A COMPLIMENTARY WIRELESS INFRASTRUCTURE TO MEET THE INCREASING DEMANDS IN OUR COMMUNITY. USING THE SAME LTE TECHNOLOGY AS COMMERCIAL CARRIERS AND LEVERAGING OUR OWN FIBER INFRASTRUCTURE FOR BACK CALL WE SET OUT TO BUILD OUR OWN SELF SELF PROVISIONED WIRELESS SYSTEM THAT WE NOW CALL OUR BORDER LINK AND THEY SHOULD'VE. WE BEGAN IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO DEVELOP SMALL PROOF OF CONCEPT PILOTS WITH SEVERAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS SERVING OUR STUDENTS WITH THE GREATEST NEEDS. WE BEGAN CONNECTING SCHOOL BUSES AND OTHER USE CASES TO TEST OUT THE VIABILITY AND THE IMPACT OF THE NETWORK. IN FALL OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE BEGAN BUILDING OUT THE L. T. ENOUGH NETWORK AND EIGHT OF OUR MOST RURAL COMMUNITIES IN THE COUNTY. AT THAT STAGE OF OUR DEVELOPMENT WE HAVE DEVELOPED OF IT WE HAVE DISTRIBUTED ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED HOME UNITS TO STUDENTS WITH NO INTERNET ACCESS AT HOME. WELL THIS WAS SIGNIFICANT IN ADDRESSING THE HOMEWORK GAP FOR THOSE EIGHT HUNDRED STUDENTS WE HAD NO IDEA THAT A PANDEMIC WAS ON THE HORIZON AND THE NEED FOR THE NETWORK WAS GOING TO BECOME MISSION CRITICAL FOR OUR SCHOOLS OVERNIGHT. IN MARCH OF THIS YEAR WE PRIORITIZE EXPANDING COVERAGE AND CAPACITY OF THE NETWORK AS OF TODAY WE HAVE MORE THAN THIRTY SEVEN HUNDRED STUDENTS PARTICIPATING IN DISTANCE LEARNING THROUGH BORDER LINK ACCESS EACH DAY WELL THIS CURRENTLY REPRESENTS ABOUT 10% OF STUDENTS AND IMPERIAL COUNTY. IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THESE ARE THE 10% OF OUR STUDENTS WHO HAD LIMITED OR NO OPTIONS PRIOR TO BOARDING. OUR DISTRICTS ARE NOW MOVING TO ONE TO ONE DEVICE AND INTERNET INITIATIVES THIS YEAR AS A RESULT OF THE PANDEMIC AND OUR GOAL IS HAVING EVERY STUDENT WITH BORDER LINK ACCESS BY THE END OF THE YEAR. IT'S IMPORTANT ALSO TO DRAW A DISTINCTION BETWEEN GENERAL INTERNET ACCESS AND BORDER LINK SERVICE BECAUSE YOU KNOW. BORDER LINK SERVICES ACTUALLY AN EXTENSION OF THE SCHOOL NETWORK INTO THE HOME OR WHEREVER THE STUDENT IS. SCHOOLS CAN PROVISION CONTENT FILTERING- AND OTHER SERVICES JUST AS IF THE STUDENT WERE SITTING IN THE CLASSROOM CONNECTED TO THE SCHOOL NETWORK. MODELING PUTS THE CLASSROOM CONNECTION IN THE HANDS OF STUDENTS THUS EXTENDING LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES AND CLOSING THE HALLMARK OUT. I'D LIKE TO SHARE ONE EXAMPLE OF WHY THIS WORK IS SO IMPORTANT FOR ALL F US. BUT HE SAID LOOKING DONNA IS A SINGLE MOTHER OF TWO SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN MONEY SELL AS A PARTICIPANT IN THE COW WORKS PROGRAM AT OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE. AND SHE'S ENROLLED IN THE NURSING PROGRAM. WHERE WELL MY CELL AND HER TWO GIRLS LIVE IN AN AREA OF OUR COUNTY WITH NO INTERNET SERVICE. THE RIGOR AND DEMANDS OF THE NURSING PROGRAM REQUIRED MAHDI SALEH TO STAY AT THE COLLEGE INTO THE LATE EVENINGS IN ORDER TO HAVE THE INTERNET ACCESS THAT SHE NEEDED TO COMPLETE HER STUDIES. THIS CAME AT THE COST OF TIME WITH HER STUDENTS ARE WITH HER GIRLS AS WELL AS PLACE TREMENDOUS STRESS ON THE AND HARDSHIP ON OUR FAMILY. ACCORDING TO OUR ACCORDINGLY HER GIRLS EXPERIENCE FIRST HAND THE HOMEWORK GAP FOR THEIR OWN SCHOOL. BORDER LINK ACCESS IMMEDIATELY CHANGED HER SITUATION AND THAT OF HER DAUGHTERS. I'D LIKE TO QUOTE SOMETHING MUDDY SELA SAID AS SHE TEARED UP IN AN INTERVIEW SHE SAID AND I QUOTE. INTERNET IS NOT A LUXURY BUT IT IS A NECESSITY. I'M THRILLED TO SHARE WITH YOU ALL TODAY THAT MONEY SALAS GRADUATING THIS DECEMBER- WITH A NURSING DEGREE. AND IS CURRENTLY PREPARING FOR THE BOARD EXAM TO BECOME A REGISTERED NURSE. MUDDY SELA HER CHILDREN AND SO MANY OTHER FAMILIES ARE WHY THIS WORK IS SO INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. AND I CHOSE HER STORY TO SHARE WITH YOU BECAUSE HER STORY HIGHLIGHTS THAT THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT SOLVING THE HOMEWORK GAP FOR OUR STUDENTS. IT'S ALSO ABOUT SUPPORTING OUR FAMILIES AND PREPARING OUR WORKFORCE FOR THE FUTURE. AS WE LOOK TOWARD SOLVING THE GAPS IN ACCESS AND OPPORTUNITY ACROSS CALIFORNIA I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THE ROLE THAT OUR PUBLIC AGENCIES. AND SPECIFICALLY COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION CAN PLAY IN BUILDING. MAINTAINING AND PROVIDING INTERNET SERVICE IN OUR STATE. THE EXPERTISE THE CAPACITY AND THE ABILITY TO GET IT DONE HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED NOT JUST IN IMPERIAL COUNTY BUT IN COUNTIES ACROSS THE STATE. CALIFORNIA IS A VERY DIVERSE STATE I DON'T NEED TO TELL YOU THAT BUT AND WE HAVE MANY CHALLENGES IN ORDER TO SOLVE THE HOMEWORK OUT FOR MORE THAN SIX MILLION STUDENTS. BUT WE ALSO NEED TO RECOGNIZE IT WILL TAKE A RANGE OF APPROACHES TO MEET THAT CHALLENGE. AND SO I THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TODAY AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING TOGETHER. TO CLOSE THE GAP AND ENSURE EQUITABLE ACCESS TO OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER FOR LIBRARY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR TAKING UP IF YOU DO THIS. AND AS SCHEDULED- WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE NOW- WITH THE PUBLIC COMMENTS. AND I'M GONNA ASK IF THERE'S ANY. AND MISTER PHILLY STILL THERE BUT WILL HAVE A QUESTION ANSWER RIGHT AFTER. APOLOGIZE ALMOST SKIPPED IF THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND I SEE MISTER KALRA HAS A FIRST. MIKE UP THANK- THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER SURE. AND I YOU KNOW I JUST WANNA MAKE A COMMENT REGARDING AND SURVIVES A LITTLE MADE REFERENCE YOU KNOW BEING IN SAN JOSE AND OF THE COUPLE'S LOGAN VALLEY AND IS WHAT WE CALL OURSELVES BUT- THE REALITY IS THAT. THE REALITY IS VERY DIFFERENT IN THE IMAGE EVEN WE SEE SOME OF THE- COMMERCIALS ON TV ABOUT INTERNET ACCESS FOR LOW INCOME AND IT'S A FAMILY OF FOUR RUNS NICE KITCHEN TABLE. YEAH YOU KNOW I WANT TO PUT IT IN A REAL CLEAR PICTURE OF WHAT'S GOING ON WE HAVE. CENSUS TRACTS IN. MY DISTRICT WILL HAVE 2530% OR MORE HOUSEHOLDS WITHOUT INTERNET CONNECTION. DOES THAT OVERLAYS VERY CLEARLY. BUT SOME OF THE ZIP CODES THAT HAVE THE HIGHEST INCIDENCE OF COVERT INFECTIONS AND DEATHS IN THE BAY AREA. IN FOR THE WEALTHIEST PLACES IN THE NATION THIS IS HAPPENING. WE ARE FAMILIES LIVING THREE FOUR FAMILIES IN THE HOUSEHOLD OF FAMILIES IN THE GARAGE THE OF HOMELESS FAMILIES LIVING. IN CARS. I'D I'D I JUST MENTION THAT BECAUSE I KNOW THAT EVERYONE I THINK CHAU DONNA PUT IT VERY WELL. EVERYONE'S DOING MORE THAN THEY'VE EVER BEEN ASKED TO DO- BUT WE STILL HAVE. SO MANY GAPS THAT NEED TO BE FILLED PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE WAY OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM IS SET UP. WE HAVE SOME MEANS WE HAVE OVER SIXTEEN DISTRICTS IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY. ALONE UNDER THE UMBRELLA. OF THE OFFICE OF. EDUCATION WHICH IS TRYING TO KIND OF. KEEP EVERYTHING- OF THE TOTAL HE SAID WHICH ISN'T NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO DO- AND ALTHOUGH WE ABSOLUTELY APPRECIATE. OF OUR PRIVATE SECTOR PARTNERS AND YOU KNOW EIGHTEEN TO FOR EXAMPLE DID DONATE HOTSPOT DEVICES. THEY'RE STILL COST TWENTY DOLLARS A MONTH FOR SERVICE. THAT FALLS ON. THE BOARD EDUCATION DISTRICTS THE PARTNERS THE FAMILY SOMEONE'S GOING TO PAY FOR THAT. AND IF YOU HAVE MULTIPLE CHILDREN LIVING IN THE HOUSEHOLD. THAT WOULD NEED MULTIPLE HOTSPOTS YOU CAN SEE THE PICTURE THAT'S BEEN PAINTED RIGHT NOW- IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND SO. I MENTION THIS BECAUSE- I THINK WE ALL BASED UPON THE PRESENTATION WE'VE HEARD FROM ALL THREE. OF OUR OUR PANELS- THAT THE SITUATION IS VERY DIRE WE KNOW. TO SOME EXTENT OF THE THINGS THAT NEED TO BE DONE BUT THE SCALE OF WHAT HAS TO BE DONE IS A NORMA'S. ENDED CHAU DONALD POINT EARLIER WE'RE THE ONES I GOTTA FIND A WAY. TO FIX IT THE BEST THAT WE CAN- BUT THE ANSWERS THE DISTRICTS THE YOU KNOW I KNOW CERTAINLY OUR OFFICE EDUCATION IS. ANOTHER DESPERATELY ASKING FOR HELP AND I KNOW ALL OF US HERE COMMITTED TO TRY TO GET THAT HELP. BUT I THINK THAT WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THE SCALE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS BEYOND ANYTHING THAT ANY OF US TO FACE JUST LIKE SO MANY OTHER THINGS HAPPENING DURING THIS PANDEMIC. BUT IT GOES BEYOND THE PANDEMIC BECAUSE WE'VE GOT TO CREATE THESE AFTER WE HAVE TO CREATE THIS ACCESS FAR BEYOND. OF WHAT WHEN WERE A PATHOGENIC WHENEVER WITH THAT MAY BE OF THE BECAUSE AGAIN EVEN IN SILICON VALLEY I HAVE FAR TOO MANY CHILDREN. THAT HAVE NO OR VERY LITTLE OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE- OF THE PUTTING TOO MUCH ON THE SCHOOL TO TRY TO FIX THESE GAPS ARE NOT THE FAULT OF THE SCHOOL SO ANYWAY THAT'S THE ONLY MY CLOSING. STATEMENT AS WELL MISTER CHAIRMAN I WOULD JUST THINK YOU LISTEN TO SOME OF THE COMMENTS I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT- FOLKS KNOW THAT WHETHER IT'S A RULE. OR IN THE HEART OF SILICON VALLEY THESE PROBLEMS ARE DIRE AND WE REALLY NEED TO DO EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN AND THE WEEKS AND MONTHS. AHEAD JUST TAKE A POINT OF PERSONAL PRIVILEGE HERE WOULD. ENCOURAGED BECAUSE- NOT FOR PROFIT SO I WOULD I WOULD URGE YOU TO CONTINUE. TO TALK. A THE TO IMPORT ISSUES THIS SILENT. BUT AT THE POINT OF PERSONAL PRIVILEGE AND I DON'T LIKE THE TIME AND TO SAY I THINK THE RESPONSE OF THE BEARS ON ALL OF US NOT JUST THOSE WHO YOU WILL MENTION. THIS IS A JOINT EFFORT WERE LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES WITH THE STATE WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS TO CHIP IN WITH A SERVICE PROVIDERS NEED TO CHIP AND WHAT WERE OR WERE WERE IN A PANDEMIC THIS HAPPENS ONCE. AND HUNDREDS OF THE HUNDREDS OF YEARS ONCE AND THEN GENERATIONS OF THIS IS THE KIND OF STUFF THAT LANDS IN HISTORY BOOKS. AND HUNDREDS F YEARS FROM NOW THE READ ABOUT BECAUSE OF. IT IT. IS UNIMAGINABLE AND WE DON'T KNOW THE DEPTH OF WHAT WE'RE GOING THROUGH. THIS RESPONSIBILITY BEARS ON EVERYONE. TO ACHIEVE SOME SORT OF EQUITY AS A CONSTANT LEARNING AND THE QUALITY OF EDUCATION FOR THE CHILDREN OF OUR LOT OF OUR TIME. MR GARCIA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR GOOD TO SEE YOU MISTER FOR NOW FROM IMPERIAL COUNTY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR PROVIDING SOME TESTIMONY TODAY AND ALSO TO THE OTHER INDIVIDUALS WHO SPOKE EARLIER I WANTED TO TOUCH A LITTLE BIT ON AB SIXTEEN SIXTY FIVE IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WHICH WAS AUTHORED BY MYSELF AND NUMBER OF OTHER YOU KNOW POLITICS INCLUDING- MISS AGUIAR-CURRY YOU'VE JUST STEPPED OUT AND- AND A HANDFUL OF OTHER FOLKS- WERE OF GOING TO ATTEMPT TO MAKE SOME IMPROVEMENTS TO THAT PIECE OF LEGISLATION COMING IN JANUARY AND WE'RE GOING TO. LEAN HEAVILY ON THE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE INTO MANY OF OUR OTHER COLLEAGUES- WHO PARTICIPATED IN BOTH WORK GROUPS LAST YEAR I'M GOING TO ASK ON THE THREE INDIVIDUALS WHO PARTICIPATED IN THAT EFFORT AND THEN ASK OUR ESTEEMED FORMER COLLEAGUE NOW SUPERVISOR- FROM THE MONTEREY AREA SOME QUESTIONS AS WELL BUT- MISS MCINTYRE AND MISTER FOR NOW. AND THEN MISTER LANE HOPE YOU KNOW WHAT- WHAT THREE AREAS WOULD YOU SAY IF WE COULD IMPROVE ON AB SIXTEEN SIXTY FIVE WOULD YOU FOCUS ON- TODAY GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WERE FACED WITH AS IT RELATES TO THIS PANDA THE DISK LEARNING CIRCUMSTANCES PERHAPS THE FUNDING ASPECTS OF IT- I'D LOVE TO HEAR FROM YOU ALL IF YOU HAVE TO FOCUS ON THREE PARTICULAR AREAS- WHAT WOULD THEY BE AND- I GUESS I'LL START WITH EVEN- THE PERSON WHO SPOKE FIRST AT STEVE CARLSON WILL GO DOWN TO. CAROLINE MISTER FOR NOW AND THEN WE'LL WE'LL CLOSE WITH MR. LEVEL THAT'S OKAY WITH FAIR. YEAH GOING COURAGE IT WOULD BE TO KEEP COMMENTS BRIEF. THREE POINT. AND I THINK MISTER R. CARLSON HAD THE LEAGUE'S OF ME MIGHT HAVE TO SKIP HIM IF WILL WITH THIS CAROLINE MCENTIRE THANK YOU. CONSERVATIVE I THINK YOU A FAMILY MEMBER CAROLYN MCINTYRE I'M ASSUMING THAT YOU CAN HEAR ME AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION- THE CALIFORNIA ADVANCED SERVICES FUND PROGRAM- IS BEING FULLY IMPLEMENTED BY THE COMMISSION WEEK FACT THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO BE OUT OF RESOURCES HERE'S THEM SO CLEARLY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THEY WILL BE A NEED TO HAVE WILL BE ADDITIONAL FUNDING- HOWEVER WE WOULD ENCOURAGE THE POLICYMAKERS TO CONSIDER IDENTIFYING A LONG TERM FUNDING SOURCES THAT WOULD SUPPORT NOT JUST BROADBAND DEPLOYMENT BUT BROADBAND ADOPTION AND DIGITAL LITERACY WOULD BE THE NEXT TWO CATEGORIES I WOULD. MOVE TO AND IN THAT WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT IN FINDING THE PROGRAM LONG TERM CARE WITH THEIR CHARGE IS IN THE BEST INTERESTS TO HAVE AS A CALIFORNIANS THE AND WILL ULTIMATELY GET THE JOB DONE AND THEN MY THIRD ISSUE I WOULD INCLUDE IN THAT IS THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE NUMBER FARMS RELATED TO- THE CHALLENGES THAT WE'RE FACING WITH REGARDS TO PERMITTING PROJECTS ARE TAKING A VERY LONG TIME TO BE APPROVED- AT THE AT VARIOUS LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT AND THAT CLEARLY THERE'S SOMETHING THAT COULD BE DONE TO EXPEDITE THE DEPLOYMENT OF THE. INFRASTRUCTURE AND I BELIEVE THIS MISS A LITTLE WHO ASK FOR SOME COMMENTS RECOMMEND GARCIA. CORRECT MR LEVEL YOU STILL ON. ALL BECAUSE I CAN'T SEE OF ALL. THAT. KEEP IN MIND AS A DELAY SO WE'RE GONNA WAIT A COUPLE SECONDS EVERY TIME I ASK SOMEBODY SOMETHING MR LEE HOW ARE YOU STILL ON. I'M GONNA ASSUME NOT IF YOU HAVE AS A COME ON THAT A LOT OF AN ALASKAN AND THEN YOU HAVE TO SERVE YOUR QUESTION FROM THIS I DON'T KNOW YEAH. WANT TO GET THAT MAYBE SURE THREE AREAS THAT HE WOULD- SUGGEST US MOVING FORWARD AS IMPROVEMENTS TO THAT- EFFORT SEVERAL YEARS AGO. MR FENNEL. HI YEAH ASSEMBLYMEMBER GARCIA YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN AWHILE SINCE I'VE READ THE BILL LANGUAGE I THINK WHAT I WOULD WANT TO DO FOR YOU IS ACTUALLY TAKE SOME TIME WITH IT MEET WITH MY TEAM AND THEN GIVE USE THAT FEEDBACK- DIRECTLY- BUT I WILL SAY JUST IN GENERAL AS WE LOOK FOR REFORM AND SOLUTIONS TO WHERE WE HOW WE MOVE FOWARD WITH ENSURING THAT THAT WE GET TO THAT GOAL OF EVERYONE HAVING ADEQUATE ACCESS AND TO OPPORTUNITY THROUGH DIGITAL ACCESS AT HOME ESPECIALLY. THAT THAT WE LOOK AT IT'S GOING TO TAKE AS I MENTIONED IN MY COMMENTS IT'S GOING TO TAKE A LOT OF APPROACHES MANY DIFFERENT APPROACHES WE ARE VERY DIVERSE STATE AND SO MAKING SURE THAT WE DON'T LOOK TO TRADITIONAL WAYS AND METHODS OF SOLVING THIS SOLUTION BUT THAT WE REALLY- OPEN BE OPEN TO LOOKING AT- NONTRADITIONAL WAYS OF SOLVING THESE ISSUES AND FOR US THE SECRET SAUCE FOR US WAS MAKING SURE THAT WE WORK TOGETHER WITH OUR LOCAL PUBLIC AGENCIES ASSET MAP WHO HAS WHAT WHO CAN BRING WHAT TO THE TABLE AND THEN WORK TOGETHER IT'S THIS IT'S THE PARTNERSHIP. THAT ACTUALLY MAKES THIS WORK SO- AND THAT WOULD BE MY INITIAL- OFF THE CUFF COMMENT JUST ONE FOLLOW UP WORK FOR MR FENNELL THE GIVEN THAT YOU'RE LEADING THE CHARGE FORTY- COUNTY SCHOOL. AND YOU. THAT THE SCHOOL. MAYBE EVEN THE LOCAL. IN OUR REGION. I PUT AWAY A VITAL ROLE TO REALLY. TAE THE LEAD ON SOME OF THE INTEREST INVESTMENTS OUT THERE ELABORATION WITH IN SOME CASES THE ISPS OR FOR THAT MATTER IN SOME INSTANCES- FOR THEM DIRECTLY- LEADING THE CHARGE- AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER. AS THE INDEPENDENT AS EFFORT. WITHOUT THE ISPS AFTER. WITHOUT THE RIGHT. AT WHAT ABSOLUTELY AS I MENTIONED IT'S GONNA TAKE A MULTIPLE- IS IT GONNA TAKE MY MULTITUDE OF APPROACHES TO IT I THINK YOU KNOW WE LEARNED FROM OTHERS THAT LED BEFORE US SO YOU KNOW WE WORK CLOSELY WITH KINGS COUNTY AS ONE EXAMPLE WE ARE NOW- TRYING TO HELP AND ASSIST OTHER COUNTIES WERE WORKING WITH COLUSA COUNTY NOW- SO YOU% KNOW OUR SOLUTION IS OUR SOLUTION FOR IMPERIAL COUNTY- BUT THERE ARE LESSONS LEARNED AND BRIGHT SPOTS WITHIN IT THAT CAN BE SHARED WITH OTHERS- WHERE IT MAKES SENSE TO REPLICATE OUR MODELS SUCH AS AN COLUSA. WE ARE HELPING THEM DO THAT- IT MAY NOT BE THE RIGHT SOLUTION FOR SOME OTHER COUNTY IN CALIFORNIA BUT- WE DO NEED TO STAY FOCUSED ON THE GOAL NOT THE MATH THE TRADITIONAL METHODS AND MEANS TO GET THERE. THANK YOU. SURE ANY OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS HAVE ANY OTHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF.

IMPACT IN THIS AND IT WILL BE CARRIED IDEAS- MOVING FORWARD IN THE AND THE LEGISLATIVE ENDEAVORS ALTHOUGH HEARING COMMITTEE TO DISCUSS SPECIFIC LEGISLATION DISPERSANTS DISCUSSED SPECIFIC ISSUES THAT CAN TURN INTO THAT SORT OF ADVOCACY IN CHANGES THAT WE NEED TO GET- TO THE BRIDGE- THAT DIGITAL DIVIDE IN EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR THOSE WHO ARE LEFT BEHIND LIKE.

MAJOR FOCUS OF LIGHT SPEEDS ADMISSION IS MENTAL HEALTH IN ONLINE SAFETY SO AS WE'VE HEARD TODAY IS ABSOLUTELY PARAMOUNT TO MAKE SURE THAT CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCESS TO INTERNET CONNECTIVITY BUT- THERE'S ALSO THE NEXT QUESTION AS WE ARE RELEGATED TO THE THERAPIST AND LEARNING. HOW DO WE ENSURE MENTAL HEALTH HOW DO WE ENSURE ONLINE SAFETY SO THAT IS A BIG PILLAR A BIG FOCUS OF LIGHTS BE THE MISSION AND AS A STATE FACILITATES CONVERSATIONS ON DISTANCE LERNING THROUGH THESE TASK FORCES THROUGH THESE WORKING GROUPS- WE THINK THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT CONVERSATION WE- CONTINUE.

PLEASE STOP USING THE WORD PANDEMIC. THE CDC NOW CALLS THIS AN OUTBREAK THERE IS NO PANDEMIC. THE VIRUS WITH A SURVIVAL RATE OF OVER 99% IS NOT A PANDEMIC. CHILDREN DO NOT DIE FROM THIS VIRUS AND THEY CAN SAFELY GO BACK TO IN PERSON SCHOOL THE VERY PREMISE OF THIS HEARING IS FLAWED. MORE THAN EVER CHILDREN NEED TO HAVE ACCESS TO IN PERSON SCHOOL AS KEVIN KILEY SAID THIS LOCKDOWN IS BY ITS VERY NATURE INHERENTLY INEQUITABLE. CHILDREN WHO WERE ALREADY SUFFERING IN CALIFORNIA ARE SUFFERING EVEN MORE NOW THIS LOCKDOWN IS SIMPLY EXACERBATING THE INEQUALITY AMONG PEOPLE MORE THAN EVER. SCHOOL IS WHERE CHILDREN MANY CHILDREN HAVE ACCESS TO ANY KIND OF STABILITY IN THEIR LIVES WHAT SO EVER FROM THEIR MEALS TO A CONSPIRACY CONSISTENT PERSON LIKE A TEACHER THE PRESENCE OF ADULTS MANY TUITION BASED SCHOOLS HAVE MANAGED TO FIND THEIR WAY TO BE OPEN FOR IN PERSON CHILDREN FOR THE TUITION BASED PLAYERS.
