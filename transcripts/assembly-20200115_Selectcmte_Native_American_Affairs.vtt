00:32:00.318 --> 00:32:01.019
THINGS WITH PLACE BASED

00:32:12.163 --> 00:32:16.401
WORSE. PART OF- LEARNING ABOUT

00:32:16.467 --> 00:32:19.070
THE SCIENCES ESPECIALLY WITH

00:32:19.137 --> 00:32:22.740
LIKE A LOT OUT. AND SO THE

00:32:22.807 --> 00:32:26.110
SPEECH. THAT TEXT FOR

00:32:26.177 --> 00:32:27.345
UNDERSTANDING OF ARMENIAN

00:32:27.412 --> 00:32:28.980
HISTORY WHEN THEY COME IN-

00:32:29.047 --> 00:32:31.849
THEIR FRESHMAN YEAR THEY HAVE

00:32:31.916 --> 00:32:35.453
MORE OF AN IDEA OF WHAT THEY'RE

00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:37.588
SORT OF WORRIED ABOUT AND-

00:32:37.655 --> 00:32:44.829
LEARNING OF. CALIFORNIANS

00:32:44.896 --> 00:32:45.430
TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT

00:32:45.496 --> 00:32:51.602
WAS THE DATE. CALIFORNIA HAS

00:32:51.669 --> 00:32:53.371
ALWAYS BEEN A POPULOUS PLACE IS

00:32:53.438 --> 00:32:58.943
HOME RIGHT NOW TO A HUNDRED AND

00:32:59.010 --> 00:32:59.544
NINE TWO HUNDRED ELEVEN TRIBES

00:32:59.610 --> 00:33:00.111
BUT BACK THEN YOU'RE TALKING

00:33:00.178 --> 00:33:15.026
ABOUT TRIBES EVERYWHERE. THERE

00:33:15.093 --> 00:33:18.496
IS NO EMPTY SPACE OF WILDERNESS

00:33:18.563 --> 00:33:20.331
THAT EXISTS IN THIS PLACE THAT

00:33:20.398 --> 00:33:24.302
WE CURRENTLY CALL CALIFORNIA.

00:33:24.369 --> 00:33:24.936
THE WAY YOU KNOW THAT THEY WERE

00:33:25.002 --> 00:33:26.637
CALIFORNIA INDIANS EVERYWHERE.

00:33:26.704 --> 00:33:28.906
IS THAT EVERY PLACE HAD A NAME.

00:33:28.973 --> 00:33:31.175
THERE WAS NOT MOUNT TEN OR A

00:33:31.242 --> 00:33:33.778
FIELD OR REGION THAT THERE

00:33:33.845 --> 00:33:38.416
WASN'T A TRIBE WHO HAD ALREADY.

00:33:38.483 --> 00:33:39.917
FOR THE SCIENCES I THINK THAT

00:33:39.984 --> 00:33:41.319
THE LAND BRIDGE THERE HAS

00:33:41.386 --> 00:33:42.487
ALWAYS BEEN SORT OF A FIRST

00:33:42.553 --> 00:33:44.389
POINT OF. KNOWLEDGE ABOUT

00:33:44.455 --> 00:33:48.459
NATIVE PEOPLE. BUT THERE ARE

00:33:48.526 --> 00:33:49.293
MANY STUDIES THAT HAVE SHOWN

00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:51.262
THAT THERE WERE AS HUMANS IN

00:33:51.329 --> 00:33:52.830
THIS SIDE OF THE AMERICAS. OVER

00:33:52.897 --> 00:33:55.299
A HUNDRED THOUSAND YEARS AGO.

00:33:55.366 --> 00:33:57.935
WHICH WOULD MEAN THAT. THAT IS

00:33:58.002 --> 00:34:00.037
AROUND THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME

00:34:00.104 --> 00:34:00.638
IN WHICH THEY SAY PEOPLE WERE

THERE'S EVIDENCE OF WAYS IN

00:34:58.262 --> 00:34:59.831
WHICH THEY'RE SHAPING WHAT WE

00:34:59.897 --> 00:35:00.364

SSTEM OF LAWS AND GOVERNANCE

00:38:10.821 --> 00:38:14.091

00:45:48.412 --> 00:45:49.480
ABOUT THE MAKING OF THE VIDEO

00:45:49.546 --> 00:45:51.381
AND THERE'S A SCENE IN THERE ME

00:45:51.448 --> 00:45:53.417
TEACHING MY STUDENTS AND I LOVE

00:45:53.484 --> 00:45:55.385

LIKE ANY VIEWS THAT IN MY FILE.

00:46:18.642 --> 00:46:20.177
I THINK ONE REASON WHY I MADE

00:46:20.244 --> 00:46:21.512
THIS VIDEO IS BECAUSE WE WANTED

00:46:21.578 --> 00:46:22.646

REMIND THEM THAT- THE

00:46:28.452 --> 00:46:29.887
CALIFORNIAN IN HISTORY THAT WE

00:46:31.488 --> 00:46:32.923
GENOCIDE IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT

00:46:32.990 --> 00:46:34.491
SORT OF THE DEATH AND

00:46:34.558 --> 00:46:35.626

00:46:39.296 --> 00:46:39.830
IMPORTANCE OF WHO WE ARE AS

00:46:39.897 --> 00:46:42.166
CALIFORNIA INDIAN PEOPLE TODAY.

00:46:42.232 --> 00:46:44.001
AND WHEN WE SHOWED THE VIDEO IN

PUBLIC SPACES WHAT WE LIKE TO

00:46:46.403 --> 00:46:51.675
DO IS TO GUIDE PEOPLE PASSED.

00:46:51.742 --> 00:46:53.977
THE MOMENT. THE FIRST BEING

00:46:54.044 --> 00:46:55.245

PAST THAT PART. AND STAY. AND

00:47:08.825 --> 00:47:10.160

WHILE HE WAS STILL ON THE TOP

00:48:10.554 --> 00:48:12.389
F IT. AND HE RAN DOWN THE

00:48:12.456 --> 00:48:14.725
ENTIRE TREE SO THAT NOTHING

00:48:14.791 --> 00:48:17.661
WOULD HAPPEN TO HIM AND THEN

00:48:17.728 --> 00:48:19.463
JUMPED OFF OF IT. AND JUST

00:48:19.529 --> 00:48:20.264

OUR FUTURE WHAT DOES THIS MEAN

00:48:52.129 --> 00:48:53.997
FOR OUR WORLD. IT BECOMES

00:48:54.064 --> 00:48:55.832
IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THAT THE

00:48:55.899 --> 00:48:57.234
HISTORY OF GENOCIDE IN THE

00:48:57.301 --> 00:48:58.935

00:48:59.002 --> 00:49:01.305
POLICIES THAT CONTINUE THINGS

00:49:01.371 --> 00:49:04.241
LIKE THE SEIZURE OF OUR WATER

00:49:04.308 --> 00:49:05.475
THE BUILDING OF DAMS THE WAYS

00:49:05.542 --> 00:49:07.411
IN WHICH WE POURED AND THEY

00:49:07.477 --> 00:49:10.047
POURED MERCURY INTO THE WATER

00:49:10.113 --> 00:49:10.681
THAT WE STILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH

WE ARE STILL DEALING WITH.

00:49:12.516 --> 00:49:13.517
PERCUSSIONS OF WHAT HAPPENED

DURING THE SYSTEM AND THE GOLD

00:49:15.686 --> 00:49:16.720
RUSH AND WE NEED TO REMEMBER

00:49:32.602 --> 00:49:35.972
KEEP GOING ON AND NOT TO THINK

00:49:36.039 --> 00:49:37.174
THIS IS THE ONLY INFORMATION

00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:39.309
THAT THEY NEED TO UNDERSTAND

00:49:39.376 --> 00:49:39.810
WHAT'S HAPPENING IN OUR

00:49:39.876 --> 00:49:40.410
COMMUNITY. PEOPLE HAVE WRITTEN

00:49:40.477 --> 00:49:42.713
MANY. THIS I WOULD ENCOURAGE

00:49:42.779 --> 00:49:43.680
YOU TO READ. BUT THE TWO THAT I

00:49:43.747 --> 00:49:44.514
ALWAYS ELL PEOPLE TO START

00:49:44.581 --> 00:49:46.116
WITH OUR GENOCIDE IN NORTH WEST

00:49:46.183 --> 00:49:49.019
CALIFORNIA. BY JACK NORTON AND

00:49:49.086 --> 00:49:51.588
BAD INDIANS BY DEBORAH MARANDA.

00:49:51.655 --> 00:49:52.656
I THINK I'S IMPORTANT TO POINT

00:49:52.723 --> 00:49:55.292
OUT THAT THE MISSION MYTHOLOGY

00:49:55.359 --> 00:49:56.593
THAT'S FOR REDDING CALIFORNIA

00:49:56.660 --> 00:49:58.128
THROUGH OUR MISSION PROJECT AND

00:49:58.195 --> 00:49:59.730
I MISSION CURRICULUM TEACHES

00:49:59.796 --> 00:50:01.164
PEOPLE THAT THE MISSION SYSTEM

00:50:01.231 --> 00:50:03.567
WAS BE NINE. BUT IT IS NOT THE

00:50:03.633 --> 00:50:05.569
CASE IN FACT SEXUAL ASSAULT OF

00:50:05.635 --> 00:50:07.304
A WOMAN WITH ONE OF THE FIRST

00:50:07.371 --> 00:50:09.206
ACTS RECORDED BY MISSIONARIES

00:50:09.272 --> 00:50:11.908
AS A RESULT OF THE SYSTEM. THIS

00:50:11.975 --> 00:50:13.577
YEAR ALSO MARKS THE FORTIETH

00:50:13.643 --> 00:50:15.312
ANNIVERSARY OF JACK NORTON

00:50:15.379 --> 00:50:16.613
GENOCIDE IN NORTH WEST

00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:17.814
CALIFORNIA NORTON IS A WHO BUT

00:50:17.881 --> 00:50:20.250
CHEROKEE SCHOLAR AND WHAT HE

00:50:20.317 --> 00:50:21.284
VIEWED WITH THAT WHAT HAPPENED

00:50:21.351 --> 00:50:22.986
IN CALIFORNIA WITH THE GENOCIDE

00:50:23.053 --> 00:50:24.888
HE USE SETTLER ARCHIVES TO

00:50:24.955 --> 00:50:26.656
PROVE THAT. HE TALKED ABOUT

00:50:26.723 --> 00:50:27.724
SOME OF THE MOST HORRIFIC

00:50:27.791 --> 00:50:29.526
THINGS THAT HAPPENED TO OUR

00:50:29.593 --> 00:50:32.162
PEOPLE TO MY PEOPLE AND FAMILY

00:50:32.229 --> 00:50:35.298
THINGS LIKE MASSACRES THE

00:50:35.365 --> 00:50:37.300
INDISCRIMINATE KILLING OF WOMEN

00:50:37.367 --> 00:50:39.603
AND CHILDREN AND THE CREATION

00:50:39.669 --> 00:50:42.539
OF LAWS THAT ALLOW THEM TO A

00:50:42.606 --> 00:50:46.576
SLAVE. CALIFORNIA INDIAN PEOPLE

00:50:46.643 --> 00:50:49.012
IN THE CALIFORNIA ENTERED THE

00:50:49.079 --> 00:50:54.151
STATE THE MAN KNOWS THE STATE.

00:50:54.217 --> 00:50:54.885
LOOK AT THE WAY RECORDS

00:50:54.951 --> 00:50:56.420
HUMBOLDT COUNTY WHAT YOU DOUBT.

00:50:56.486 --> 00:50:57.487
THAT MOST PEOPLE IN SLAVE UNDER

00:50:57.554 --> 00:50:57.988
THESE LAWS AND CAL. WERE

00:50:58.054 --> 00:50:59.356
ACTUALLY CHILDREN. AGES SEVEN

00:50:59.423 --> 00:50:59.923
TO TWELVE AND MOST OF THOSE

00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:00.857
WERE YOUNG GIRLS. SO REALLY

00:51:00.924 --> 00:51:01.825
THEY HAD CREATED A SYSTEM OF

00:51:01.892 --> 00:51:04.127
SEX SLAVERY IN WHICH THEY WERE

00:51:04.194 --> 00:51:05.762
TRADING AT YOUNG WOMEN AMONGST

00:51:05.829 --> 00:51:07.564
EACH OTHER. THIS IS VERY

00:51:07.631 --> 00:51:09.099
IMPORTANT BECAUSE TODAY WE

00:51:09.166 --> 00:51:10.834
STILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE

00:51:10.901 --> 00:51:12.269
REPLICATIONS OF THIS IF YOU

00:51:12.335 --> 00:51:13.737
LOOK AT THE FACT. THAT WE ARE

00:51:13.804 --> 00:51:16.239
THE MOST LIKELY GROUP OF PEOPLE

00:51:16.306 --> 00:51:18.108
TO BE RATE IN THE UNITED STATES

00:51:18.175 --> 00:51:19.376
OF AMERICA WE ARE THE MOST

00:51:19.443 --> 00:51:21.945
LIKELY TO GO MISSING. AND

00:51:22.012 --> 00:51:23.213
MURDERED WE ARE THE MOST LIKELY

00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:24.648
TO BE TRAPPED IN THE THAT'S

00:51:24.714 --> 00:51:25.882
THAT'S THAT DON'T ESCAPE THE

00:51:25.949 --> 00:51:28.518
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THIS IS

00:51:28.585 --> 00:51:30.987
THE LASTING THIS IS THE LAST

00:51:31.054 --> 00:51:33.356
THING. HAPPENED THREE GENOCIDE.

00:51:33.423 --> 00:51:33.990
I WE ARE FORCED TO PROTECT OUR

00:51:34.057 --> 00:51:34.758
YOUNG GIRLS TO. THEM WAY ONCE

00:51:34.825 --> 00:51:37.594
AGAIN TO PROTECT THEM. NOT JUST

00:51:37.661 --> 00:51:39.095
THROUGH LEGISLATION BUT THROUGH

00:51:39.162 --> 00:51:40.297
THE WAY THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND

00:51:40.363 --> 00:51:42.899
US AND KNOW THAT WE ARE PEOPLE.

00:51:42.966 --> 00:51:44.501
WE CONTINUE TO ALSO HAVE TO

00:51:44.568 --> 00:51:45.802
FIGHTFOR OUR ENVIRONMENT AND

00:51:45.869 --> 00:51:47.604
OUR ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE. THE

00:51:47.671 --> 00:51:49.172
GOLD RUSH WAS DESTRUCTIVE TO

00:51:49.239 --> 00:51:51.441
THE ENVIRONMENT LANDS RECEIVED

00:51:51.508 --> 00:51:52.909
AS A RESULT OF THE GOLD RUSH

00:51:52.976 --> 00:51:54.811
AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF

00:51:54.878 --> 00:51:56.379
PEOPLE IN THIS STATE. THAT

00:51:56.446 --> 00:51:59.316
STILL TRACE THEIR RIGHTS TO

00:51:59.382 --> 00:52:03.119
LAND AND OWNERSHIP OF LAND AND

00:52:03.186 --> 00:52:05.455
WATER BACK TO THE GOLD RUSH.

00:52:05.522 --> 00:52:08.558
LOOK AT THE WAY. THEY WERE. I'M

00:52:08.625 --> 00:52:09.860
LEAD. TIME IT WAS AS A DIRECT

00:52:09.926 --> 00:52:10.827
RESULT OF KILLING AND MASSACRES

00:52:10.894 --> 00:52:11.661
OF CALIFORNIA INDIAN PEOPLE.

00:52:11.728 --> 00:52:13.129
AFTER MASSACRE SETTLERS WOULD

00:52:13.196 --> 00:52:14.965
ENTER THE REGION THEY WOULD

00:52:15.031 --> 00:52:16.399
MAKE UP DOCUMENTS AND THEY

00:52:16.466 --> 00:52:17.868
WOULD SAY THAT THEY NOW OWNED

00:52:17.934 --> 00:52:20.337
THAT LAND AND ONLY TO THOSE

00:52:20.403 --> 00:52:21.538
RESOURCES. TRACING BACK ANY

00:52:21.605 --> 00:52:22.606
TYPE OF OWNERSHIP TO THE

00:52:22.672 --> 00:52:26.142
CALIFORNIA GOLD RUSH ERASES THE

00:52:26.209 --> 00:52:26.743
VIOLENCE THAT IT TOOK TO MAKE

00:52:26.810 --> 00:52:29.045
THAT HAPPEN. IF WE'RE GOING TO

00:52:29.112 --> 00:52:30.313
TALK ABOUT TWO THREE HEALING IN

00:52:30.380 --> 00:52:32.516
CALIFORNIA WE CAN'T SPEND THE

00:52:32.582 --> 00:52:34.117
NEXT FEW YEARS JUST TESTIFYING

00:52:34.184 --> 00:52:35.519
TO OUR HISTORIES. FOR THE

00:52:35.585 --> 00:52:36.953
BENEFIT OF THE STATE GOVERNMENT

00:52:37.020 --> 00:52:38.288
WE NEED TO BE GIVEN THE

00:52:38.355 --> 00:52:40.390
OPPORTUNITY TO DEVELOP CONCRETE

00:52:40.457 --> 00:52:42.526
ACTIONS AND WE NEED TO REMEMBER

00:52:42.592 --> 00:52:44.160
THAT WHILE WE HAVE THE EAR OF

00:52:44.227 --> 00:52:45.595
OUR NEW GOVERNOR WE HAVE TO

00:52:45.662 --> 00:52:47.631
REMIND HIM THAT OUR WORK IS ON

00:52:47.697 --> 00:52:49.232
GOING. THAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING

THIS FOR A LONG TIME AND THAT

00:52:51.234 --> 00:52:52.369
WE SHOULD BE INTO BECAUSE WE

00:52:52.435 --> 00:52:55.772

MORE ALSO BE ACCOUNTABLE TO

00:52:59.643 --> 00:53:00.043

THE COUNTRY. WE ARE LESS THAN

00:53:16.293 --> 00:53:20.430

CALIFORNIA IS TO CONSIDER IT

00:54:39.175 --> 00:54:42.112
AS- LIKE AN AMALGAM OF HISTORY

SYSTEM I'VE FINING REALLY

00:55:05.001 --> 00:55:06.369
INTERESTING MOMENTS OF THINKING

00:55:06.436 --> 00:55:08.605
ABOUT WHO ARE THE ACTUAL PEOPLE

00:55:08.672 --> 00:55:10.306
THAT ARE INVOLVED. IN THE

00:55:10.373 --> 00:55:11.875
SPANISH SIDE OF IT IF YOU LOOK

00:55:11.941 --> 00:55:12.776
AT THE SPANISH SOLDIERS WE HAVE

00:55:12.842 --> 00:55:13.977
AN ASSUMPTION OF WHO THEY MIGHT

00:55:14.044 --> 00:55:16.746
BE THEY TEND TO ACTUALLY BE. A

00:55:16.813 --> 00:55:18.882
LOT OF THEM ARE- LIKE PEOPLE OF

00:55:18.948 --> 00:55:20.784
COLOR IN SLAVE TO PEOPLE WHO

WAY TO GET TO MOVE UP THE CASTE

00:55:25.622 --> 00:55:26.623
SYSTEM. THERE'S A LOT REALLY

00:55:26.690 --> 00:55:27.624

01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:52.281
STUDENTS. AND SOMETIMES PEOPLE

01:00:52.348 --> 01:00:54.050
WORRY THAT YOU CAN'T TEACH THE

TO DO THE SAN DIEGO MISSION.

01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:05.061
AND WHAT SHE WAS GOING TO DO IS

01:01:05.128 --> 01:01:06.496
BUILD IT AND THEN SET IT ON

01:01:06.562 --> 01:01:09.532
FIRE AND THEN TURN IN THE ASHES

01:01:09.599 --> 01:01:11.200
OF THAT PROJECT BECAUSE THAT'S

01:01:11.267 --> 01:01:12.602
WHAT THE COOLEY I HAD DONE WHEN

THEY REVOLTED THEY HAD SET THE

01:01:14.270 --> 01:01:16.172
MISSION ON FIRE. AND WE BOTH

01:01:16.239 --> 01:01:17.006
SAID IT WOULD BE HISTORICALLY

01:01:17.073 --> 01:01:19.976
ACCURATE- AND INSTEAD SHE BUILT

01:01:20.043 --> 01:01:21.444

01:01:28.418 --> 01:01:30.086
OF THE QUESTIONS OF THE FOURTH

01:01:30.153 --> 01:01:31.487

01:01:33.122 --> 01:01:34.090
PEOPLES AND IT WAS VERY

01:01:34.157 --> 01:01:35.591
POWERFUL THE WATCHER DO THAT

AND TO ALSO THEN SEE WHAT SHE

01:01:37.326 --> 01:01:39.395
SAID TO STUDENTS. SO I KNOW

01:01:39.462 --> 01:01:40.630
THAT FOURTH GRADERS CAN HANDLE

01:01:40.696 --> 01:01:41.864
IT AND I KNOW THAT WE CAN'T

01:01:41.931 --> 01:01:43.433
JUST TAKE OUT. THIS IDEA OF HOW

01:01:43.499 --> 01:01:44.267
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THESE

01:01:44.333 --> 01:01:45.902
COMPLEX CONVERSATIONS AND WHEN

SAID NO. IT MADE ME REALIZE

01:01:52.041 --> 01:01:54.310
THAT CALIFORNIA INDIANS ARE

01:01:54.377 --> 01:01:57.847

SAYING KILL THE INDIAN AND SAVE

01:12:06.121 --> 01:12:07.556
THE MAN THEY WERE TAKING

01:12:07.623 --> 01:12:09.725
CHILDREN AWAY FROM THE

01:12:09.792 --> 01:12:11.393
COMMUNITIES AND THIS WAS

01:12:11.460 --> 01:12:14.763
HAPPENING OF AS LATE AS THE

01:12:14.830 --> 01:12:15.297
NINETEEN FORTIES NINETEEN

01:12:15.364 --> 01:12:18.934
FIFTIES. I KNOW IT TOOK AWAY

AND THEY WILL CUT THEIR HAIR.

01:12:19.601 --> 01:12:23.739
AND. WHEN I TALK ABOUT CUTTING

01:12:23.806 --> 01:12:24.306
THE HAIR IT MEANS MORE THAN

01:12:24.373 --> 01:12:27.643
THAT. IF YOU LOOK AT THIS. THIS

01:12:27.710 --> 01:12:29.144
IS PART OF WHO WE ARE IN OUR

01:12:29.211 --> 01:12:30.179
CREATION STORIES WE HAVE THE

01:12:30.245 --> 01:12:32.448
SAME CREATION STORIES. IT TALKS

01:12:32.514 --> 01:12:34.650
ABOUT THE WILDCAT HAD A LONG

01:12:34.717 --> 01:12:35.718
TAIL BUT WHEN THE CREATOR DIED

01:12:35.784 --> 01:12:37.453
BECAUSE STILL IN MOURNING SO WE

01:12:37.519 --> 01:12:39.688
DO THAT SO WHEN YOU CUT

01:12:39.755 --> 01:12:40.255
SOMEBODY'S HERE YOU. YOU PUT

01:12:40.322 --> 01:12:42.624
SOMEBODY IN MORNING. YOU PUT

01:12:42.691 --> 01:12:44.526
SOMEBODY A AND A SENSE OF LAWS.

01:12:44.593 --> 01:12:48.630
pWHAT IT WAS ILLEGAL FOR US TO

01:12:48.697 --> 01:12:50.733
PRACTICE OUR RELIGION. AND IT

01:12:50.799 --> 01:12:52.735
WAS ILLEGAL TO PRACTICE OUR I'M

01:12:52.801 --> 01:12:54.503
TO SPEAK OUR LANGUAGE. IT

01:12:54.570 --> 01:12:55.704
WASN'T UNTIL THE FREEDOM OF

01:12:55.771 --> 01:12:56.939
AMERICAN INDIAN RELIGION ACT

01:12:57.005 --> 01:12:58.307
WAS PASSED IN AUGUST ELEVENTH

01:12:58.373 --> 01:13:00.442
OF NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT. THAT

01:13:00.509 --> 01:13:03.011
WE HAD THE SAME PROTECTION AS

01:13:03.078 --> 01:13:03.645
ANYBODY ELSE. AS EVERYBODY ELSE

01:13:03.712 --> 01:13:05.981
IN THIS COUNTRY. AND WAS UNTIL

01:13:06.048 --> 01:13:07.683
THE NINETEEN NINETIES THERE ARE

01:13:07.750 --> 01:13:10.385
LANGUAGES WERE PROTECTED. SO

01:13:10.452 --> 01:13:10.986
THESE ARE SOME OF THE PROBLEMS

01:13:11.053 --> 01:13:14.823
THAT WE HAD. NO OTHER

01:13:14.890 --> 01:13:16.892
RESERVATIONS IS A SAID WE KNOW

01:13:16.959 --> 01:13:20.929
WE DO OF. IT WAS DIFFICULT TO

01:13:20.996 --> 01:13:22.865
BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN ON THAT

01:13:22.931 --> 01:13:23.499
RESERVATION THE LANDS THAT WERE

01:13:23.565 --> 01:13:28.170
PUT. REMEMBER OUR PEOPLES WERE

01:13:28.237 --> 01:13:28.771
FROM THE COAST ALL THE WAY TO

01:13:28.837 --> 01:13:32.941
THE DESERT. SO THE BEST LANDS

01:13:33.008 --> 01:13:34.977
THE NATIVE PEOPLE REJECTED WERE

01:13:35.043 --> 01:13:37.279
FORCIBLY REMOVED PUSHED ON TO

01:13:37.346 --> 01:13:40.482
THESE LANDS HAD NOBODY WANTED.

01:13:40.549 --> 01:13:40.983
THESE LANDS AT WERE VERY

01:13:41.049 --> 01:13:43.418
DIFFICULT TO SUSTAIN. SO AS

01:13:43.485 --> 01:13:46.822
THIS STARTED HAPPENING. THE

01:13:46.889 --> 01:13:48.257
GOVERNMENT CAME IN AND THEY

01:13:48.323 --> 01:13:49.124
WERE TAKING CHILDREN AWAY FOR

01:13:49.191 --> 01:13:51.226
THE BOARDING SCHOOLS THEY WERE

01:13:51.293 --> 01:13:53.262
COMING BACK MANY OF THEM DID

01:13:53.328 --> 01:13:54.663
WHAT I CALL COACH WHICH THEY

01:13:54.730 --> 01:13:55.998
WOULD SPEAK IN THE LANGUAGE AND

01:13:56.064 --> 01:13:57.866
THEN WHEN THE WHEN AND IT WOULD

01:13:57.933 --> 01:13:58.967
BE PUNISHED FOR SPEAKING THEIR

01:13:59.034 --> 01:14:00.235
LANGUAGE THEY WERE TALKING

01:14:00.302 --> 01:14:01.804
ENGLISH TO THEM. BUT WHAT THEY

01:14:01.870 --> 01:14:04.006
IT HAD A DELAYED AFFECT WHAT

01:14:04.072 --> 01:14:04.673
WOULD HAPPEN WAS WHEN THEY WENT

01:14:04.740 --> 01:14:06.208
HOME THEY WOULD TELL THEIR

01:14:06.275 --> 01:14:07.876
SIBLINGS YOU'RE GONNA BE GOING

01:14:07.943 --> 01:14:09.711
TO BOARDING SCHOOL NEXT DON'T

01:14:09.778 --> 01:14:11.947
TALK OUR LANGUAGE THEY'RE GOING

01:14:12.014 --> 01:14:13.148
TO HURT YOU JUST TALK IN

01:14:13.215 --> 01:14:16.251
ENGLISH SO THESE ARE SOME OF

01:14:16.318 --> 01:14:16.819
THE PROBLEMS THAT. THAT WERE

01:14:16.885 --> 01:14:18.720
TAKING PLACE. NOW REMEMBER I

01:14:18.787 --> 01:14:20.222
TOLD YOU- THE FREEDOM OF

01:14:20.289 --> 01:14:22.057
AMERICAN INTO RELIGION ACT WAS.

01:14:22.124 --> 01:14:23.826
WAS WAS PASSED IN AUGUST

01:14:23.892 --> 01:14:25.127
ELEVENTH NINETEEN SEVENTY

01:14:25.194 --> 01:14:25.761
EIGHT. THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IS

01:14:25.828 --> 01:14:29.898
THIS. PROTECTION OF LANGUAGE

01:14:29.965 --> 01:14:33.101
CULTURE AND RELIGION. MEANS

01:14:33.168 --> 01:14:33.669
NOTHING IF YOU HAVE NO MORE

01:14:33.735 --> 01:14:34.269
LANGUAGE CULTURE RELIGION LEFT

01:14:34.336 --> 01:14:37.072
TO PROTECT. THEY WERE STILL I

01:14:37.139 --> 01:14:37.673
MEAN IT WAS IT YOU KNOW THEY

01:14:37.739 --> 01:14:39.408
WERE STILL IN OF PIECES OF IT

01:14:39.474 --> 01:14:43.712
GOING. NO WE TALKED ABOUT YOUR

01:14:43.779 --> 01:14:44.279
TEACHER. AND YOU KNOW HOW HE

01:14:44.346 --> 01:14:48.050
KEPT IT GOING. SO BACK TO THE

01:14:48.116 --> 01:14:50.586
RESERVATIONS THE RESERVATION TO

01:14:50.652 --> 01:14:52.421
A HARD PLACE TO LIVE ON. WAS

01:14:52.487 --> 01:14:53.622
VERY DIFFICULT AND NO RUNNING

01:14:53.689 --> 01:14:54.656
WATER NO ELECTRICITY ON THE

01:14:54.723 --> 01:14:56.358
SENATE BY RESERVATION I

01:14:56.425 --> 01:14:59.828
REMEMBER- A JIM WAS MADE. AND

01:14:59.895 --> 01:15:01.196
THAT WAS THE PLACE WHERE PEOPLE

01:15:01.263 --> 01:15:03.432
WOULD COME AND TAKE SHOWERS

01:15:03.498 --> 01:15:04.066
TRIBAL MEMBERS ARE SOMETIMES IT

01:15:04.132 --> 01:15:05.100
WILL COME TO COOK. IT WAS A

01:15:05.167 --> 01:15:07.870
HARD PLACE TO LIVE. AND MY

01:15:07.936 --> 01:15:11.039
UNCLE HE TOLD ME WHEN HE WENT

01:15:11.106 --> 01:15:14.443
TO BOARDING SCHOOL. HE SAID

01:15:14.509 --> 01:15:15.944
THAT HE WAS TAKEN ALL THE WAY

01:15:16.011 --> 01:15:18.213
TO- THEY HAD SEEN BOND OFFICE.

01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:20.449
A IN IN BANNING AND THEN THEY

01:15:20.515 --> 01:15:21.817
ALSO HAD SAN FRANCISCO IN

01:15:21.884 --> 01:15:24.620
ARIZONA. AND THEY WOULD TAKE-

01:15:24.686 --> 01:15:25.454
NATIVE CHILDREN TO THE

01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:26.221
DIFFERENT DIVISIONS MANY OF

01:15:26.288 --> 01:15:28.557
THEM ESCAPED. SO THESE ARE SOME

01:15:28.624 --> 01:15:29.591
OF THE PROBLEMS THAT THAT WE

01:15:29.658 --> 01:15:32.928
HAD THERE. ALSO IN OUR

01:15:32.995 --> 01:15:33.528
COMMUNITIES NATIVE COMMUNITIES

01:15:33.595 --> 01:15:36.465

SUPPORT THE POPULATION. WITHOUT

01:15:44.473 --> 01:15:45.974
ELECTRICITY WITHOUT RUNNING

01:15:46.041 --> 01:15:47.743
WATER IT CAN BE DIFFICULT AND

01:15:47.809 --> 01:15:50.012
PEOPLE TEND TO CONGREGATE WHERE

01:15:50.078 --> 01:15:51.313
THEY ARE ABLE TO GET THE

01:15:51.380 --> 01:15:53.282

01:16:01.590 --> 01:16:03.325
FAULT LINE THAT WATER IS GOING

01:16:03.392 --> 01:16:05.694

WITH THE WATER THAT'S COMING

01:16:11.700 --> 01:16:14.436
FROM US WE ARE NOT ABLE TO GET

01:16:14.503 --> 01:16:16.138
THAT WATER TO HELP OUR PEOPLE.

01:16:16.204 --> 01:16:21.109

IT MAY BE AND SOUL SO TRYING TO

01:19:31.900 --> 01:19:33.969

THAT THEY WERE CHOOSING- BUT

01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:39.708
UNFORTUNATELY THOSE STORIES

01:19:39.774 --> 01:19:41.443

01:19:46.214 --> 01:19:47.883
RESEARCH THAT THEY WOULD DEAL

01:19:47.949 --> 01:19:48.483
WITH STILL. YOU KNOW THEY WERE

01:19:48.550 --> 01:19:51.253
FINE. THEY WERE GREAT- BUT SO I

01:19:51.319 --> 01:19:52.854
WOULD APPRECIATE THAT AND ALSO

01:19:52.921 --> 01:19:54.022
AS A SECOND LANGUAGE LEARNER I

01:19:54.089 --> 01:19:55.657
UNDERSTAND. THE VALUE OF THE

01:19:55.724 --> 01:19:58.760
IMMERSION. HOWEVER WHAT CAN WE

REVIVE THOSE LANGUAGES I HAVE

01:20:03.665 --> 01:20:04.933
BEEN TO SEVERAL RESERVATIONS

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:06.334
WHERE. WHERE THEY'RE DOING

01:20:06.401 --> 01:20:07.202
THEIR OWN YOU KNOW THEY HAVE

01:20:07.269 --> 01:20:08.270

SAID EARLIER CALIFORNIA'S SUCH

01:20:28.690 --> 01:20:31.593
A DIVERSE STATE. IT IS IT IS

01:20:31.660 --> 01:20:33.361
IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO WORK

01:20:33.428 --> 01:20:35.030
WITH THE NATIVE GROUPS IN THE

01:20:35.096 --> 01:20:37.666
AREA TO GET AN ACCURATE I MEAN

01:20:37.732 --> 01:20:38.200

01:20:54.316 --> 01:20:55.917
RATHER THAN TAKING SPANISH OR

01:20:55.984 --> 01:20:57.452
ANOTHER THEY'RE TAKING THEIR

01:20:57.519 --> 01:20:59.421

01:34:27.261 --> 01:34:29.130
TRIBES TO TRULY BE INVOLVED IN

01:34:29.196 --> 01:34:32.333
SOMETHING THAT IS INHERENT TO

01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:35.202
THEIR ABILITY TO PROTECT THE

01:34:35.269 --> 01:34:35.770
CHILDREN AND THE MEMBERS OF

01:34:35.836 --> 01:34:39.673
THEIR TRIBES. SO ONE OF THE BIG

01:34:39.740 --> 01:34:41.175
STRUGGLES IS WHY IS THAT

01:34:41.242 --> 01:34:46.147
DISCRETIONARY. AND I KNOW JUST

01:34:46.213 --> 01:34:47.915
FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE BY

01:34:47.982 --> 01:34:49.483
BEING THE TRIBE'S CHIEF LEGAL

01:34:49.550 --> 01:34:51.318
COUNSEL WE HAVE REQUESTED

01:34:51.385 --> 01:34:53.754
INVOLVEMENT ON SEVERAL ISSUES

01:34:53.821 --> 01:34:56.857
BUT BECAUSE IT IS THE COURTS.

01:34:56.924 --> 01:34:58.626
DISCRETION IF WE ARE GOING TO

01:34:58.692 --> 01:35:01.362
BE INVOLVED OR NOT WE ARE NOT.

01:35:01.429 --> 01:35:04.165
SO THAT'S ONE OF THE STRUGGLES

01:35:04.231 --> 01:35:06.567
IS HOW HOW CAN WE STAY IN A

01:35:06.634 --> 01:35:09.036
COMMUNITY. AND BE ABLE TO

01:35:09.103 --> 01:35:11.672
PROTECT OUR MEMBERS AND OUR

01:35:11.739 --> 01:35:15.342
CHILDREN- IF SUCH INVOLVEMENT

01:35:15.409 --> 01:35:18.479
IS NOT AN ABSOLUTE RIGHT. AS

01:35:18.546 --> 01:35:23.050
FAR AS. THAT THE LACK OF

01:35:23.117 --> 01:35:25.486
ECONOMIC RESOURCES TO TRULY

01:35:25.553 --> 01:35:28.289
PROTECT AND PRESERVE OUR

01:35:28.355 --> 01:35:28.923
CULTURAL AND SPIRITUAL LEGACIES

01:35:28.989 --> 01:35:37.398
AND- IS IT GOES TO. IT GOESBACK TO OUR HISTORY AS NON

01:35:37.465 --> 01:35:39.767
RECOGNIZED TRIBES WE DON'T HAVE

01:35:39.834 --> 01:35:42.837
A LAND BASE- WE HAVE A LOT OF

01:35:42.903 --> 01:35:44.839
EMPTY PROMISES THAT WERE GIVEN

01:35:44.905 --> 01:35:46.107
TO US THAT WE SHOULD HAVE

01:35:46.173 --> 01:35:48.542
PLANNED- AND IT'S NOT A

01:35:48.609 --> 01:35:51.045
COINCIDENCE THAT YOUR LARGEST

01:35:51.112 --> 01:35:52.580
MATCH OF TOP METROPOLITAN AREAS

01:35:52.646 --> 01:35:54.448
HAVE NO FAMILY RECOGNIZED

01:35:54.515 --> 01:35:56.317
TRIBES LOS ANGELES SAN

01:35:56.383 --> 01:35:58.986
FRANCISCO- AND IT'S NO ACCIDENT

01:35:59.053 --> 01:35:59.920
THAT YOU DON'T HAVE ANY

01:35:59.987 --> 01:36:01.956
FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBES

01:36:02.022 --> 01:36:02.523
ALONG. SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA'S

01:36:02.590 --> 01:36:08.496
COAST. AND WE WERE THERE- IN

01:36:08.562 --> 01:36:12.133
FACT WE ARE STILL THERE. IN

01:36:12.199 --> 01:36:14.235
FACT A MAJORITY OF NON FAIRLY

01:36:14.301 --> 01:36:17.004
RECOGNIZED TRIBES STILL LIVE

01:36:17.071 --> 01:36:18.005
WITHIN THEIR ANCESTRAL

01:36:18.072 --> 01:36:21.041
TERRITORY- WHICH I'M SURE YOU

01:36:21.108 --> 01:36:23.477
CAN IMAGINE IS NO SMALL FEAT

01:36:23.544 --> 01:36:24.845
GIVEN HOW EXPENSIVE IT IS TO

01:36:24.912 --> 01:36:27.214
LIVE IN THE STATE- WE ARE

01:36:27.281 --> 01:36:28.516
BUSINESS OWNERS WERE TEACHERS

01:36:28.582 --> 01:36:32.052
ARE MUSICIANS. WE ARE SCHOLARS

01:36:32.119 --> 01:36:33.888
WERE LAWYERS ON AND WE'RE

01:36:33.954 --> 01:36:37.124
MECHANICS. WE ARE IN BAD IT-

01:36:37.191 --> 01:36:40.327
WE'VE NEVER LEFT AND I THINK

01:36:40.394 --> 01:36:43.397
THAT'S WHERE WE ALWAYS. HOW WE

01:36:43.464 --> 01:36:45.399
LIKE TO PRESENT OURSELVES TO

01:36:45.466 --> 01:36:46.634
THE GOVERNMENT'S THAT WE HAVE

01:36:46.700 --> 01:36:50.604
TO WORK WITH. IN OUR CULTURE

01:36:50.671 --> 01:36:51.739
LIVES THROUGH S. BECAUSE IT'S A

01:36:51.805 --> 01:36:54.008
LIVING CULTURE. I AND SO IT'S

01:36:54.074 --> 01:36:57.344
IMPERATIVE THAT WE BE ABLE TO-

01:36:57.411 --> 01:37:00.181
HAVE. LANGUAGE PROGRAMS IT'S

01:37:00.247 --> 01:37:02.283
IMPERATIVE THAT WERE ABLE TO

01:37:02.349 --> 01:37:03.083
RECLAIM WHAT HAD BEEN

01:37:03.150 --> 01:37:04.852
FORCEFULLY TAKEN FROM US I

01:37:04.919 --> 01:37:07.321
BELIEVE- DOCTOR RODRIGUEZ AND

01:37:07.388 --> 01:37:10.758
MENTIONED. THAT THERE WAS A

01:37:10.824 --> 01:37:13.127
LANGUAGE PROGRAM BUT ONLY FOR

01:37:13.194 --> 01:37:15.362
FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBES-

01:37:15.429 --> 01:37:17.298
AND THAT'S A SHAME GIVEN THAT

01:37:17.364 --> 01:37:17.932
WE ARE IN THE STATE OF

01:37:17.998 --> 01:37:20.301
CALIFORNIA AND WE HAVE SUCH A

01:37:20.367 --> 01:37:21.468
HISTORY THAT'S FRAUGHT WITH

01:37:21.535 --> 01:37:23.304
VIOLENCE AND TOWARDS OUR OUR

01:37:23.370 --> 01:37:24.939
NATIVE PEOPLE BUT THAT'S THE

01:37:25.005 --> 01:37:26.507
KIND OF PROGRAMS THAT SHOULD BE

01:37:26.574 --> 01:37:28.776
AVAILABLE TO ALL CALIFORNIA

01:37:28.842 --> 01:37:34.682
INDIANS AND ALL TRIBES. BECAUSE.

01:37:34.748 --> 01:37:35.950
I'M NOT REALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBE

01:37:36.016 --> 01:37:37.384
SHOULDN'T BE TREATED AS A

01:37:37.451 --> 01:37:38.652
SECOND CLASS GOVERNMENT A

01:37:38.719 --> 01:37:41.488
SECOND CLASS CITIZEN IF YOU'RE

01:37:41.555 --> 01:37:43.524
A MEMBER OF A TRIBE- WE NEED TO

01:37:43.591 --> 01:37:45.659
BE SEEN WE NEED TO BE HEARD.

01:37:45.726 --> 01:37:48.395
BECAUSE OUR STORIES. AND OUR

01:37:48.462 --> 01:37:51.966
HISTORY IS ARE THE SAME AS ARE

01:37:52.032 --> 01:37:53.434
FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED-

01:37:53.500 --> 01:37:59.139
COUNTERPARTS. WE ALL WERE.

01:37:59.206 --> 01:38:01.976
VICTIMS OF ATTEMPTED GENOCIDE-

01:38:02.042 --> 01:38:03.877
MY GRANDFATHER MY GREAT

01:38:03.944 --> 01:38:05.312
GRANDFATHER WHO I MENTION WAS

01:38:05.379 --> 01:38:08.015
OUR CAPTAIN WOULD TELL HIS

01:38:08.082 --> 01:38:10.084
CHILDREN TELL HIS GRANDCHILDREN

01:38:10.150 --> 01:38:12.753
DO NOT TELL ANYONE WHO YOU ARE

01:38:12.820 --> 01:38:14.288
DON'T TELL THEM YOU'RE INDIAN

01:38:14.355 --> 01:38:15.589
ARE YOU WILL BE TAKEN TO

01:38:15.656 --> 01:38:20.394
BOARDING SCHOOL- AND THAT STOCK.

01:38:20.461 --> 01:38:23.130
SO TO MY MOTHER AND HER SISTERS

01:38:23.197 --> 01:38:25.599
WOULDN'T SAY BECAUSE THEY WERE

01:38:25.666 --> 01:38:28.902
TOLD BY THEIR LEADER DON'T- AND

01:38:28.969 --> 01:38:30.304
BECAUSE THEY HAD COUSINS WHO

01:38:30.371 --> 01:38:33.674
WERE TAKEN- AND SO MY

01:38:33.741 --> 01:38:35.709
GENERATION REPRESENTS THE FIRST

01:38:35.776 --> 01:38:37.411
ONE. THAT CAN BE PROBABLY

01:38:37.478 --> 01:38:38.979
INDIGENOUS BECAUSE MY

01:38:39.046 --> 01:38:39.580
GRANDMOTHER WAS NOT ALLOWED TO

01:38:39.647 --> 01:38:44.818
BE. AND WE FIGHT EVERY DAY TO

01:38:44.885 --> 01:38:46.020
MAKE SURE THAT OUR PRESENCE IS

01:38:46.086 --> 01:38:47.421
KNOWN BECAUSE I YOU SAID WE'RE

01:38:47.488 --> 01:38:51.525
STILL HERE. SOME OF THE

01:38:51.592 --> 01:38:55.262
EXAMPLES OF WHERE. WHERE WERE

01:38:55.329 --> 01:38:56.463
CONFLICTED OR WE'RE WE'RE

01:38:56.530 --> 01:39:00.734
BATTLING THE STRUGGLES IS THAT.

01:39:00.801 --> 01:39:02.269
WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL FOR THE

01:39:02.336 --> 01:39:04.672
PASSAGE OF AB FIFTY TWO-

01:39:04.738 --> 01:39:06.707
REQUIRING LEAD H. SEEK RELIEF

01:39:06.774 --> 01:39:08.809
AGENCIES TO CONSULT WITH TRIBES

01:39:08.876 --> 01:39:11.211
EARLY ON IN THE PROCESS OF LAND

01:39:11.278 --> 01:39:13.547
DEVELOPMENT SO THAT IF OUR-

01:39:13.614 --> 01:39:15.282
TRIBAL CULTURE RESOURCES ARE

01:39:15.349 --> 01:39:16.950
GOING TO BE NEGLEYIMPACTED

01:39:17.017 --> 01:39:18.819
THERE'S A REAL CHANCE THAT THE

01:39:18.886 --> 01:39:20.988
DEVELOPMENT CAN BE MODIFIED TO

01:39:21.055 --> 01:39:24.091
AVOID THAT IMPACT- IN

01:39:24.158 --> 01:39:26.460
UNFORTUNATELY- TROUBLE

01:39:26.527 --> 01:39:29.863
REPRESENTATIVES. IN ORDER TO

01:39:29.930 --> 01:39:31.832
HAVE TRUE IMPACT YOU HAVE TO

01:39:31.899 --> 01:39:34.568
HAVE MULTIPLE MEETINGS. WITH

01:39:34.635 --> 01:39:36.070
OUR PLANNERS LEE AND DECISION

01:39:36.136 --> 01:39:38.572

ONLY ONES AT THE TABLE WHO ARE

01:39:41.475 --> 01:39:43.077
NOT BEING PAID FOR OUR

01:39:43.143 --> 01:39:46.647

01:39:46.714 --> 01:39:47.514

DEVELOPMENT OF. SECRET

01:39:50.250 --> 01:39:51.018
MITIGATION MEASURES THAT ARE

01:39:51.085 --> 01:39:53.220
CULTURAL CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE

01:39:53.287 --> 01:39:55.322
THAT ARE REQUIRED BY THE LAW.

01:39:55.389 --> 01:39:57.591
THAT THEY PRESENT- THEY HAVE

01:39:57.658 --> 01:40:00.227
INCLUDED IN THEIR DOCUMENTS- SO

01:40:00.294 --> 01:40:03.364
WHETHER WE'RE MEDIAN UNDER SB

01:40:03.430 --> 01:40:04.665

EXECUTIVE ORDER BE TEN ELEVEN-

01:40:07.201 --> 01:40:08.001
THE TRIBES ARE BEING

01:40:08.068 --> 01:40:10.504
COMPENSATED SO IT'S AT YOUR OWN

01:40:10.571 --> 01:40:12.673
ECONOMIC LOSS TO PROVIDE THAT

01:40:12.740 --> 01:40:15.209
INFORMATION SO A TRIBE. WHO'S

01:40:15.275 --> 01:40:20.848
ALREADY. NOT IN WHO IS NOT

01:40:20.914 --> 01:40:23.217
FLUSH WITH MONEY. HAS TO MAKE A

01:40:23.283 --> 01:40:26.887
DECISION. IF THEY'RE GOING TO

01:40:26.954 --> 01:40:28.222
PARTICIPATE IN THE PROCESS TO

01:40:28.288 --> 01:40:31.258
PROTECT SACRED SITES. AND TAKE

01:40:31.325 --> 01:40:33.260
THAT ECONOMIC LOSS OR THEY'RE

01:40:33.327 --> 01:40:36.897
NOT GOING TO AND THEN HAVE TO.

01:40:36.964 --> 01:40:37.364
BEING A DEAL WITH THE

01:40:37.431 --> 01:40:42.803
CONSEQUENCES IN THE FUTURE. BUT.

01:40:42.870 --> 01:40:44.405
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW THIS

01:40:44.471 --> 01:40:46.907
BIT I'M GONNA SING YOU DON'T.

01:40:46.974 --> 01:40:48.242
BUT MOST BARELY RECOGNIZE

01:40:48.308 --> 01:40:49.943
TRIBAL MEMBERS ARE NOT ABLE TO

01:40:50.010 --> 01:40:52.946
BE COMPENSATED BY THEIR TRIED.

01:40:53.013 --> 01:40:54.481
AND SO THEY REPRESENT THEIR

01:40:54.548 --> 01:40:57.284
TRIBES UNDER NO FEE ARE

01:40:57.351 --> 01:41:02.222
VOLUNTARY BASIS- AND SO. THEY

01:41:02.289 --> 01:41:03.924
HAVE TO HAVE DAY JOBS IN SO.

01:41:03.991 --> 01:41:08.829
HUH AND WITH THERE ARE NO

01:41:08.896 --> 01:41:13.233
SPECIFIC GRANTS AVAILABLE FOR-

01:41:13.300 --> 01:41:14.701
THE FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBES

01:41:14.768 --> 01:41:17.271
CAN APPLY FOR A GRANT OR

01:41:17.337 --> 01:41:18.338
FUNDING FOR TRIBAL HISTORIC

01:41:18.405 --> 01:41:21.308
PRESERVATION OFFICERS- THERE'S

01:41:21.375 --> 01:41:22.309
OTHER GRANTS I'M NOT SAYING

01:41:22.376 --> 01:41:24.278
THEY'RE NOT COMPETITIVE GRANTS

01:41:24.344 --> 01:41:26.747
TO GET THAT KIND OF FUNDING-

01:41:26.814 --> 01:41:28.248
BUT THEY'RE JUST PLAINLY NOT

01:41:28.315 --> 01:41:30.017
AVAILABLE TO NOT FREELY

01:41:30.083 --> 01:41:35.055
RECOGNIZE STRIPES. AND SO. THEY

01:41:35.122 --> 01:41:38.492
HAVE TO SACRIFICE THEIR OWN

01:41:38.559 --> 01:41:40.093
LIVELIHOODS TO BE ABLE TO DO

01:41:40.160 --> 01:41:43.664

CALIFORNIA INDIAN WOMAN I AM

01:41:48.335 --> 01:41:51.371
GRATEFUL FOR THEIR SACRIFICES-

TO BE ABLE TO PROTECT THE

01:41:53.006 --> 01:41:56.410
LEGACY OF THEIR ANCESTORS-

01:41:56.477 --> 01:41:59.947
ANOTHER CONCERN I KNOW. ANOTHER

01:42:00.013 --> 01:42:00.814

WHERE THEY BELONG THEY NEED TO

BE REBURIED. UNFORTUNATELY

01:42:57.638 --> 01:42:59.540
BECAUSE WE ARE NOT FEDERALLY

01:42:59.606 --> 01:43:02.643
RECOGNIZED WE HAVE NO LAND BASE.

01:43:02.709 --> 01:43:04.444
OUR LANDS WERE VALUABLE THAT'S

01:43:04.511 --> 01:43:07.848
WHY WE'RE NOT. IT IS WE HAD TO

01:43:07.915 --> 01:43:10.584
BE AND THEY WERE TAKEN SO OUR

01:43:10.651 --> 01:43:13.420
ANCESTORS CAN'T GO BACK TO MOST

01:43:13.487 --> 01:43:14.721
LIKELY WHERE THEY CAME FROM

01:43:14.788 --> 01:43:15.956
BECAUSE NOW IT'S NOT CULTURALLY

01:43:16.023 --> 01:43:18.492
APPROPRIATE IT'S BEEN DEVELOPED

01:43:18.559 --> 01:43:22.663
IT'S NOT SAFE. SO WE NEED LAND

01:43:22.729 --> 01:43:25.065
SO THAT WE CAN RE BURY THE

01:43:25.132 --> 01:43:26.633

COOL. AGAIN GREAT THAT WE'RE AT

01:43:44.017 --> 01:43:46.086
A PLACE NOW WHERE THE STATE

01:43:46.153 --> 01:43:47.788
WANTS TO REPATRIATE OUR

01:43:47.854 --> 01:43:49.590
ANCESTORS TO US SO THAT THEY

01:43:49.656 --> 01:43:52.125

01:43:52.192 --> 01:43:54.428
DIGNITY AND RESPECT- AND TAKEN

01:43:54.494 --> 01:43:57.831

01:43:57.898 --> 01:43:59.366
SAME TIME WE NEED A PLACE TO

01:43:59.433 --> 01:44:01.101
PUT THEM AND IT NEEDS TO BE

01:44:01.168 --> 01:44:04.504

01:44:04.571 --> 01:44:06.907

WE CAN HELP MEDIATE DISPUTES IF

02:09:27.826 --> 02:09:29.261
THAT IF THE TRIBES THAT ARE

02:09:29.328 --> 02:09:31.864
TRYING TO CLAIM REPATRIATION OF

ROLE IN FACILITATING THIS. AND

02:09:57.956 --> 02:09:59.458
I DID THIS TO BACK UP A LITTLE

02:09:59.525 --> 02:10:02.060
BIT SO CALIFORNIA NOW PRESS. I

02:10:02.127 --> 02:10:03.228
DON'T KNOW IF THE I MEAN I

02:10:03.295 --> 02:10:05.898
THINK YOU ALL ARE FAMILIAR WITH

02:10:05.964 --> 02:10:06.498
THAT IT WAS IMPLEMENTED IN TWO

02:10:06.565 --> 02:10:10.002
THOUSAND AND ONE. AND THEN

02:10:10.068 --> 02:10:11.670
ASSEMBLYMAN STEINBERG AUTHORED

02:10:11.737 --> 02:10:13.672
THIS BILL AND IT WAS MAINLY TO

02:10:13.739 --> 02:10:16.375
DEAL WITH THE UNIQUE.

02:10:16.441 --> 02:10:18.110
CIRCUMSTANCES OF CALIFORNIA

02:10:18.177 --> 02:10:20.312
INDIANS IN THAT THEY WEREN'T

02:10:20.379 --> 02:10:22.581
ABLE TO USE THE FEDERAL LAW. TO

02:10:22.648 --> 02:10:24.483
REPATRIATE THEIR HUMAN REMAINS

02:10:24.550 --> 02:10:28.053
FROM THESE INSTITUTIONS. AT

02:10:28.120 --> 02:10:30.522
THAT TIME THE UC WAS ONE OF THE-

02:10:30.589 --> 02:10:32.424
I GUESS VOLATORS AND

02:10:32.491 --> 02:10:34.993
UNFORTUNATELY UC BERKELEY STILL

02:10:35.060 --> 02:10:38.597
HOLDS AS OF A TWO THOUSAND

02:10:38.664 --> 02:10:41.533
EIGHTEEN REPORT NINE THOUSAND

02:10:41.600 --> 02:10:42.067
TWO HUNDRED SETS OF HUMAN

02:10:42.134 --> 02:10:46.238
REMAINS. OF THOSE THEY ARE

02:10:46.305 --> 02:10:49.441
SAYING THAT 86% OF THOSE THEY

02:10:49.508 --> 02:10:50.709
DON'T KNOW THE CULTURAL

02:10:50.776 --> 02:10:53.412
AFFILIATION AND FOR PURPOSES OF

02:10:53.478 --> 02:10:55.547
THE LAW THAT MEANS THAT THEY

02:10:55.614 --> 02:10:57.649
DON'T HAVE TO REPEAT TREAT THEM

02:10:57.716 --> 02:11:00.319
BECAUSE THEY CLAIM THAT THEY

02:11:00.385 --> 02:11:00.819
DON'T KNOW WHO THEY ARE

02:11:00.886 --> 02:11:05.457
DESCENDED FROM. THEY ALSO HAVE

02:11:05.524 --> 02:11:06.058
THIRTEEN THOUSAND THIS WAS IN

02:11:06.124 --> 02:11:07.826
THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN

02:11:07.893 --> 02:11:10.896
REPORT ON- UC CAMPUS CAP IT

02:11:10.963 --> 02:11:13.098
KNACK PER ACTIVITIES THAT THEY

02:11:13.165 --> 02:11:16.235
ALSO HAVE THIRTEEN THOUSAND

02:11:16.301 --> 02:11:17.402
THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE-

02:11:17.469 --> 02:11:20.172
ASSOCIATED FUNERARY OBJECTS AND

02:11:20.239 --> 02:11:22.708
THOSE- THAT'S THE TECHNICAL

02:11:22.774 --> 02:11:26.078
LEGAL TERM BUT- FROM A TRIBAL

02:11:26.144 --> 02:11:27.879
PERSPECTIVE WE THINK OF THOSE

02:11:27.946 --> 02:11:28.780
IS BURIAL GOODS AND GRADE GOODS

02:11:28.847 --> 02:11:32.417
IN SACRED ITEMS- THEY HAVE OVER

02:11:32.484 --> 02:11:32.951
THIRTEEN THOUSAND OF THOSE

02:11:33.018 --> 02:11:37.489
ITEMS. OF WHICH 72% THEY SAY

02:11:37.556 --> 02:11:39.424
ARE CULTURALLY UNAFFILIATED

02:11:39.491 --> 02:11:41.793
MEANING THEY DON'T KNOW WHO TO

02:11:41.860 --> 02:11:43.662
REPEAT THEIR REPATRIATE THEM TO

02:11:43.729 --> 02:11:45.831
OR THEY SAY THAT THERE ISN'T AN

02:11:45.897 --> 02:11:48.133
EXISTING PRESENT DAY GROUP.

02:11:48.200 --> 02:11:49.401
THAT CAN SHOW THAT THERE

02:11:49.468 --> 02:11:50.636
CULTURALLY AFFILIATED WITH

02:11:50.702 --> 02:11:53.071
THOSE ITEMS THIS IS A HUGE

02:11:53.138 --> 02:11:56.842
PROBLEM- BERKELEY HAS AT THE

02:11:56.908 --> 02:12:00.012
PHOEBE HEARST MUSEUM HAS ONE OF

02:12:00.078 --> 02:12:01.079
THE LARGEST NAGS PRO

02:12:01.146 --> 02:12:03.582
IMPLEMENTED COLLECTIONS IN THE

02:12:03.649 --> 02:12:07.786
NATION. AND THIS IS ON A SCALE

02:12:07.853 --> 02:12:08.387
AND THE PHOEBE HEARST MUSEUM

02:12:08.453 --> 02:12:09.454
HAS ADMITTED THAT THEY'VE SAID

02:12:09.521 --> 02:12:12.224
WE DON'T WE WE'RE NOT A CAN TO

02:12:12.291 --> 02:12:13.625
OTHER EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS

02:12:13.692 --> 02:12:15.927
IN CALIFORNIA. OUR COLLECTIONS

02:12:15.994 --> 02:12:16.828
ARE ON A SCALE THAT'S

02:12:16.895 --> 02:12:19.064
EQUIVALENT TO THE AMERICAN

02:12:19.131 --> 02:12:20.666
MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY OR

02:12:20.732 --> 02:12:22.467
THE SMITHSONIAN WE'RE TALKING A

02:12:22.534 --> 02:12:24.903
LARGE COLLECTION HERE THAT HAS

02:12:24.970 --> 02:12:28.073
A UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCE OF HOW

02:12:28.140 --> 02:12:29.875
IT'S GOING TO BE TREATED HOW WE

02:12:29.941 --> 02:12:31.977
CAN A TACKLE THIS ISSUE.

02:12:32.044 --> 02:12:33.645
BECAUSE PRESENTLY THERE ARE

02:12:33.712 --> 02:12:35.047
NUMBER OF TRIBES THAT ARE

02:12:35.113 --> 02:12:37.683
TRYING TO INVOKE THE STATE CAL

02:12:37.749 --> 02:12:40.085
KNACK PRATT TO GET THESE THINGS

02:12:40.152 --> 02:12:41.887
FOR PATRIOT IT BECAUSE THE

02:12:41.953 --> 02:12:43.689
STATE CAL NOW PER ADDS SOME

02:12:43.755 --> 02:12:44.589
EXTRA ELEMENTS OF THE FEDERAL

02:12:44.656 --> 02:12:47.359
LAW DOESN'T ADD THAT RECOGNIZES

02:12:47.426 --> 02:12:49.361
THIS WHOLE ARC OF UNIQUE.

02:12:49.428 --> 02:12:51.163
TERMINATION AND GENOCIDE

02:12:51.229 --> 02:12:52.964
HISTORY THAT YOU'VE HEARD OF

02:12:53.031 --> 02:12:55.734
THERE'S- THERE'S AN AND A PIECE

02:12:55.801 --> 02:12:58.070
ABOUT STATE LANDS AFFILIATION

02:12:58.136 --> 02:13:00.072
AND THAT REALLY GIVES THE

02:13:00.138 --> 02:13:02.140
ABILITY FOR THESE INSTITUTIONS

02:13:02.207 --> 02:13:04.343
TEND NOT HAVE A STRICT

02:13:04.409 --> 02:13:08.013
CHRONOLOGICAL AND CONNECTION

02:13:08.080 --> 02:13:09.948
BUT TO HAVE AN OVER ALL-

02:13:10.015 --> 02:13:12.084
UNDERSTANDING BASED ON TRIBAL

02:13:12.150 --> 02:13:14.720
KNOWLEDGE IN HISTORY- OF THEIR

02:13:14.786 --> 02:13:17.322
TIED TO THESE ITEMS. MAKING IT

02:13:17.389 --> 02:13:19.124
EASIER FOR THEM TO SHOW THEIR

02:13:19.191 --> 02:13:21.193
CULTURAL FILIATION AND FOR THEM

02:13:21.259 --> 02:13:22.794

02:13:22.861 --> 02:13:26.898
REPATRIATED- AND THE ISSUE IN

02:13:26.965 --> 02:13:27.866
TWO THOUSAND AND ONE AND UP

02:13:27.933 --> 02:13:30.435
UNTIL NOW REALLY WITH THE

02:13:30.502 --> 02:13:32.137
CALIFORNIA NOW PER IS THAT

02:13:32.204 --> 02:13:33.638
ALTHOUGH IT HAD SOME GREAT

02:13:33.705 --> 02:13:34.573
LANGUAGE AND IT WAS NEVER

02:13:34.639 --> 02:13:37.576
FUNDED. AND IT NEVER REALLY GOT

02:13:37.642 --> 02:13:40.412
IMPLEMENTED- AND THE

02:13:40.479 --> 02:13:42.681
COMMISSION- WE GET WE ARE

02:13:42.748 --> 02:13:46.618

02:13:49.888 --> 02:13:51.123
THE COMMISSION WE HAVE

02:13:51.189 --> 02:13:53.625
OVERSIGHT TO GET THAT GOING-

02:13:53.692 --> 02:13:55.727
THE PRESENT DAY ISSUE IS THERE

02:13:55.794 --> 02:13:57.629
ARE THERE SOME THINGS SENSE THE

02:13:57.696 --> 02:14:01.500
LAW IS. A LITTLE DATED AND THE

02:14:01.566 --> 02:14:05.170
FEDERAL LAW HAS BEEN UPDATED

02:14:05.237 --> 02:14:06.071
SENSE THEN THAT THERE ARE SOME

02:14:06.138 --> 02:14:10.876
LANGUAGE THINGS THAT. IT NEED

02:14:10.942 --> 02:14:12.477
TO BE BROUGHT UP TO DATE- AND

02:14:12.544 --> 02:14:13.378
WE'RE TRYING TO DO THAT AT THIS

02:14:13.445 --> 02:14:14.946
POINT AND ONE OF THEM IS THE

02:14:15.013 --> 02:14:15.914
DEFINITION O CALIFORNIA INDIAN

02:14:15.981 --> 02:14:20.152

THAT- WHAT IS PRESENTLY BEING

02:14:23.388 --> 02:14:25.524
PROPOSED IS THIS INCLUSIVE

02:14:25.590 --> 02:14:27.292
DEFINITION OF CALIFORNIA INDIAN

02:14:29.661 --> 02:14:31.530
GIVE SOME BACKGROUND ON THAT TO

02:14:31.596 --> 02:14:33.498
SET SOME CONTACTS FOR HOPEFULLY

02:14:33.565 --> 02:14:36.435
SOME SOME- CHANGES AND

02:14:36.501 --> 02:14:38.437
LEGISLATIVE CHANGES THAT ARE

02:14:38.503 --> 02:14:41.740
GOING TO BE COMING- SOON ABOUT

02:14:41.807 --> 02:14:45.277
THAT. NOW WHEN WE'RE TALKING

02:14:45.343 --> 02:14:46.778
ABOUT WHEN I'M TALKING ABOUT IN

02:14:46.845 --> 02:14:48.046
THIS CONTEXT CALVET DEFINITION

02:14:48.113 --> 02:14:49.781

TRIBE AND WHO IS NOT A TRIBE- I

02:15:11.336 --> 02:15:12.737
AM BECAUSE THAT IS A FEDERAL

02:15:12.804 --> 02:15:13.839
RECOGNITION PROCESS OF THE

02:15:13.905 --> 02:15:15.173
STATE OF CALIFORNIA DOESN'T

02:15:15.240 --> 02:15:16.808

02:15:20.512 --> 02:15:22.447
FOR PURPOSES THAT BEING ABLE TO

02:15:22.514 --> 02:15:25.217
PARTICIPATE IN THE STATE LAWS

02:15:25.283 --> 02:15:27.519
THAT GIVE TRIBES IN NEED OF

02:15:27.586 --> 02:15:29.221
PEOPLE THE ABILITY TO PROTECT

02:15:29.287 --> 02:15:31.423
THEIR RESOURCES REPATRIATE

02:15:31.490 --> 02:15:32.457
THEIR RESOURCES PROTECT THEIR

02:15:32.524 --> 02:15:34.559
SACRED SITES SO THIS IS ALL

02:15:34.626 --> 02:15:37.295
ABOUT THAT AND CURRENTLY THE

02:15:37.362 --> 02:15:38.263
HERITAGE COMMISSION HAS A

02:15:38.330 --> 02:15:42.000

TRIBES AND THAT CONTACTLESS HAS

02:15:48.006 --> 02:15:51.643
BASICALLY BEEN ENOUGH FACTS.

02:15:51.710 --> 02:15:56.982
SENSE. TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR.

02:15:57.048 --> 02:15:58.016
WITH THE PASSAGE OF A OF A LAW

02:15:58.083 --> 02:15:59.718
CALLED SB EIGHTEEN WHICH WERE

02:15:59.784 --> 02:16:01.286
AMENDMENTS INTO THE PLANNING

02:16:01.353 --> 02:16:04.222
LAW THAT ALLOWED TRIBES TO

02:16:04.289 --> 02:16:06.525
CONSULT WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

02:16:06.591 --> 02:16:07.792
ABOUT PROTECTION A PLATE SIT

THEIR SACRED SITES WINS CITIES

02:16:10.695 --> 02:16:11.897
AND COUNTIES UP DID THEIR

GENERAL PLAN UPDATED THEIR

02:16:13.064 --> 02:16:14.599
GENERAL PLANTS. THEN THEY WOULD

02:16:14.666 --> 02:16:15.901
CONSULT WITH TRIBES TRIED TO

02:16:15.967 --> 02:16:17.936
TELL THEM WHERE SENSITIVE AREAS

02:16:18.003 --> 02:16:19.538
WERE AND HOW THEY COULD DO

02:16:19.604 --> 02:16:21.673
PROACTIVE PLANNING TO AVOID-

02:16:21.740 --> 02:16:24.242
PROTECT THESE SITES. AND AT

02:16:24.309 --> 02:16:26.545
THAT TIME THE BILL THE

02:16:26.611 --> 02:16:29.481
LEGISLATURE PUT INTO PLACE A

02:16:29.548 --> 02:16:32.250

ARE GONNA BE ABLE TO

02:16:33.785 --> 02:16:34.653
PARTICIPATE IN THIS

02:16:34.719 --> 02:16:35.954
CONSULTATION WITH LOCAL

02:16:36.021 --> 02:16:37.656
GOVERNMENTS TO PROTECT THEIR

02:16:37.722 --> 02:16:39.791
SACRED PLACES. WE KNOW THE

02:16:39.858 --> 02:16:40.825
UNIQUE HISTORY OF CALIFORNIA IT

02:16:40.892 --> 02:16:41.660
CAN'T JUST BE RACKING FEDERALLY

02:16:41.726 --> 02:16:44.896
RECOGNIZED TRIBES- AND I WAS

02:16:44.963 --> 02:16:47.332
ONE OF THE TECHNICAL PEOPLE-

02:16:47.399 --> 02:16:49.935
ALONG WITH IT IT AT MANY OTHERS

02:16:50.001 --> 02:16:51.570
THAT PUSHED FOR AN OVER

02:16:51.636 --> 02:16:53.538
INCLUSIVE DEFINITION. TO

02:16:53.605 --> 02:16:55.006
RECOGNIZE THE UNIQUE HISTORY OF

02:16:55.073 --> 02:16:57.876
CALIFORNIA AND SO WHAT THE

02:16:57.943 --> 02:16:59.411
PROCESS THAT ENDED UP BEING

02:16:59.477 --> 02:17:00.912
CODIFIED WAS THAT THE NATIVE

02:17:00.979 --> 02:17:01.947
AMERICAN HERITAGE COMMISSION AS

02:17:02.013 --> 02:17:04.749
AN EXPERT. IN CULTURAL

RESOURCES TRIBAL RESOURCES-

02:17:08.153 --> 02:17:10.989
SENSE THE EARLY EIGHTIES WOULD

02:17:11.056 --> 02:17:14.359
BE THE STATE AGENCY THAT WOULD

02:17:14.426 --> 02:17:15.827
THEN TAKE ON THE RESPONSIBILITY

02:17:15.894 --> 02:17:18.263
OF CREATING THIS CONTACTLESS

02:17:18.330 --> 02:17:20.065
FOR CONSULTATION PURPOSES AND

02:17:20.131 --> 02:17:23.668
WE DID THAT. AND THAT THEN GOT

02:17:23.735 --> 02:17:28.640
CARRIED INTO- AB FIFTY TWO

02:17:28.707 --> 02:17:30.208
WHICH IS THE THAT LOG THE

02:17:30.275 --> 02:17:31.743
AMENDMENTS AND TO SEEK WHAT.

02:17:31.810 --> 02:17:34.546
AND SO WE ALSO DESIGNATE- WE

02:17:34.613 --> 02:17:37.382
USE THAT SAME CONTACT LIST THAT

02:17:37.449 --> 02:17:38.817
WE DESIGNATE TO LOCAL

02:17:38.883 --> 02:17:41.152
GOVERNMENTS WHICH TRIBES THEY

02:17:41.219 --> 02:17:42.921
ARE TO CONSOLE WITH ON

02:17:42.988 --> 02:17:44.422
PROTECTION OF TRIBAL CULTURAL

02:17:44.489 --> 02:17:45.724
RESOURCES WHEN THEY'RE IMPACTED

02:17:45.790 --> 02:17:48.226
BY. ANY DEVELOPMENT THAT

02:17:48.293 --> 02:17:52.797
SUBJECT TO SEA QUEST. SO THE

02:17:52.864 --> 02:17:56.868
COMMISSION. AND IN EVEN BEFORE.

02:17:56.935 --> 02:17:57.535
TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR THE

02:17:57.602 --> 02:17:58.536
COMMISSION HAS BEEN IDENTIFYING

02:17:58.603 --> 02:17:59.938
WHAT'S CALLED MOST LIKELY

02:18:00.005 --> 02:18:02.340
DESCENDANTS UNDER THE NADIR

02:18:02.407 --> 02:18:03.274
UNDER THAT NATIVE AMERICAN

02:18:03.341 --> 02:18:04.876
HUMAN REMAINS LAW- SO. THE

02:18:04.943 --> 02:18:06.211
COMMISSION HAS THE FORTY YEARS

02:18:06.277 --> 02:18:07.879
OF EXPERIENCE IN IDENTIFYING

02:18:07.946 --> 02:18:10.315
WHOSE CULTURALLY AFFILIATED.

02:18:10.382 --> 02:18:12.617
AND TERMS OF WHO'S ELIGIBLE TO

02:18:12.684 --> 02:18:14.819
PARTICIPATE AND NOW WE'RE

02:18:14.886 --> 02:18:16.788
TALKING ABOUT CARING AND THAT

02:18:16.855 --> 02:18:22.794
INTO THE REPATRIATION STATUTES.

02:18:22.861 --> 02:18:23.628
AND I THINK IT'S REALLY

02:18:23.695 --> 02:18:26.264
IMPORTANT BECAUSE- IT JUST AS

02:18:26.331 --> 02:18:29.534
BACKGROUND- BUT WHEN WE WENT

02:18:29.601 --> 02:18:31.536
THROUGH THE DISCUSSIONS OF HOW

02:18:31.603 --> 02:18:33.605
DO YOU DEFINE TRIBES FOR

02:18:33.672 --> 02:18:36.408
PURPOSES OF THE STATE LAWS.

02:18:36.474 --> 02:18:38.309
THERE WAS TALK IN THE BEGINNING

02:18:38.376 --> 02:18:40.745
ABOUT ACTUALLY TRYING TO WRITE

02:18:40.812 --> 02:18:42.047
A DEFINITION OF CALIFORNIA

02:18:42.113 --> 02:18:44.883
INDIAN TRIBES AND THE

02:18:44.949 --> 02:18:46.418
LEGISLATURE CREATING THAT

02:18:46.484 --> 02:18:49.254
DEFINITION BACK IN THE EARLY

02:18:49.320 --> 02:18:51.956
TWO THOUSANDS AND IT WAS

02:18:52.023 --> 02:18:56.061
QUICKLY REALIZED THAT- DID THE

02:18:56.127 --> 02:18:57.862
TRIBES DIDN'T WANT THE STATE OF

02:18:57.929 --> 02:19:00.565
CALIFORNIA SAYING WHO WAS A

02:19:00.632 --> 02:19:02.033
TRIBE AND WHO WASN'T. AND THE

02:19:02.100 --> 02:19:04.302
STATE OF THE LEGISLATURE DID

02:19:04.369 --> 02:19:05.603
NOT REALLY WANT THAT TASK

02:19:05.670 --> 02:19:09.174
EITHER IT'S NOT IT'S NOT UP TO

02:19:09.240 --> 02:19:10.308
THEM IT'S AT ITS OUT OF THAT

02:19:10.375 --> 02:19:12.343
PER VIEW SENTENCE OF FEDERAL

02:19:12.410 --> 02:19:14.913
FEDERAL ISSUE BUT HOW THE

02:19:14.979 --> 02:19:17.315
COMMISSION DOES IT IS THAT WE

02:19:17.382 --> 02:19:20.552
IT'S BASICALLY THE TRIBES SELF

02:19:20.618 --> 02:19:23.188
IDENTIFY WHO THEY ARE AND WHERE

02:19:23.254 --> 02:19:25.724
THEIR TERRITORIES ARE. AND WE

02:19:25.790 --> 02:19:28.159
DO THAT BASED ON TWO MAIN

02:19:28.226 --> 02:19:30.361
CRITERIA ONE IS THAT I AM

02:19:30.428 --> 02:19:31.963
SHOWING THAT THEY ARE DESCENDED

02:19:32.030 --> 02:19:34.199
FROM A HISTORICAL CALIFORNIA

02:19:34.265 --> 02:19:35.767
TRIBE AND THE OTHER IS THAT

02:19:35.834 --> 02:19:37.368
THEY HOLD THEMSELVES OUT AS A

02:19:37.435 --> 02:19:38.236
TRIBAL GOVERNMENT AND THEY

02:19:38.303 --> 02:19:41.806
OPERATE THAT WAY. AND IF THEY

02:19:41.873 --> 02:19:43.241
CAN SHOW THOSE THINGS AND SHOW

02:19:43.308 --> 02:19:44.476
AND IT'S SUBMIT THOSE

02:19:44.542 --> 02:19:47.078
DOCUMENTS- THE COMMISSION PUTS

02:19:47.145 --> 02:19:49.047
THEM ON THE LIST OF WHO IS A

02:19:49.114 --> 02:19:50.381

02:19:55.653 --> 02:19:58.923
HAD ANY COMPLAINTS THAT THAT

02:19:58.990 --> 02:20:01.292

WE'VE BEEN UNDER FUNDED FOR SO

02:20:09.834 --> 02:20:13.505
LONG BUT THE OVERALL FEEDBACK

02:20:13.571 --> 02:20:14.539
THAT THE COMMISSION HAS

02:20:14.606 --> 02:20:18.176
RECEIVED IS THAT THIS PROCESS

02:20:18.243 --> 02:20:19.677

UNFORTUNATELY AND THE LAW AS IT

02:20:41.666 --> 02:20:43.535
EXISTS THAT IS JUST. IT'S NOT

02:20:43.601 --> 02:20:45.103
EVEN COMPLAIN WITH FEDERAL LAW

02:20:45.170 --> 02:20:46.638
AT THIS POINT IT'S JUST AN OLD

02:20:46.704 --> 02:20:49.107

HERITAGE COMMISSION AS BEING

02:23:57.962 --> 02:23:59.530
ABLE TO. LOOK AT THE

02:23:59.597 --> 02:24:01.099
INCLUSIVENESS OF THOSE

02:24:01.165 --> 02:24:03.935
DEFINITIONS BUT IT'S BECAUSE-

02:24:04.002 --> 02:24:05.837
OF THE INADVERTENT DISCOVERY.

02:24:05.903 --> 02:24:07.071
THAT'S BEING DONE THROUGHOUT

02:24:07.138 --> 02:24:09.307
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND

02:24:09.374 --> 02:24:11.009
GIVING THE WAY BACK TO THE

02:24:11.075 --> 02:24:12.377
ORIGINAL PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF

02:24:12.443 --> 02:24:14.579
CALIFORNIA ALL CALIFORNIA

02:24:14.645 --> 02:24:16.047
PEOPLE WHEN IT COMES TO THE

02:24:16.114 --> 02:24:17.815
THAT THOSE DISCUSSIONS OF WHAT

02:24:17.882 --> 02:24:20.852
CONSTITUTES- REMAINS WHAT

02:24:20.918 --> 02:24:22.120
CONSTITUTES ASSOCIATE BURIAL

02:24:22.186 --> 02:24:24.222
GOODS WITH THEM AND WHEN THE

02:24:24.288 --> 02:24:25.656
TRIBAL PEOPLE ELDERS ARE SAYING

02:24:25.723 --> 02:24:27.759
ALL THIS. IS ASSOCIATED WITH IT

02:24:27.825 --> 02:24:30.895
THEN I THINK THE WEIGHT OF THAT

02:24:30.962 --> 02:24:31.429
SHOULD BE WITH THE TRIBAL

02:24:31.496 --> 02:24:35.500
ELDERS. DEFINITELY AND I THINK.

02:24:35.566 --> 02:24:37.301
THE ONE OF THE LORD ONE OF THE

02:24:37.368 --> 02:24:40.538
CHALLENGES THAT YOU POINTED OUT

02:24:40.605 --> 02:24:44.475
WHEN TRIBES- ARE TO- CONSOLE

02:24:44.542 --> 02:24:46.077
WITH THESE INSTITUTIONS

02:24:46.144 --> 02:24:47.278
ESPECIALLY THE ACADEMIC

02:24:47.345 --> 02:24:50.715
INSTITUTIONS. UNFORTUNATELY THE

02:24:50.782 --> 02:24:53.384
ARCHAEOLOGISTS OPINIONS ARE

02:24:53.451 --> 02:24:55.420
GIVEN GREATER WEIGHT THAN THE

02:24:55.486 --> 02:24:58.923
TRIBAL KNOWLEDGE AND THE TRIBAL

02:24:58.990 --> 02:25:03.161
HISTORY AND SO. IT IT RELATED

02:25:03.227 --> 02:25:04.429
TO HAVING AN INCLUSIVE

02:25:04.495 --> 02:25:06.831
DEFINITION AND THE AND THE

02:25:06.898 --> 02:25:08.332
PEOPLE AT THE TABLE THAT NEED

02:25:08.399 --> 02:25:10.835
TO BE AT THE TABLE IS ALSO THE

02:25:10.902 --> 02:25:16.307
RESPECT- AND THE INCLUSION AND

02:25:16.374 --> 02:25:18.176
HOPEFULLY LEGISLATIVELY

02:25:18.242 --> 02:25:21.045
MANDATED INCLUSION OF TRIBAL

02:25:21.112 --> 02:25:24.382
KNOWLEDGE- INTO THOSE DECISIONS

02:25:24.449 --> 02:25:26.984
BECAUSE- THEY TRY TO REMOVE

02:25:27.051 --> 02:25:28.519
FROM THE LANDS AND NO FAULT OF

02:25:28.586 --> 02:25:30.655
THEIR OWN AND LOS TIES AND LOST

02:25:30.721 --> 02:25:32.790
SOME OF THAT INFORMATION. BUT

02:25:32.857 --> 02:25:34.725
THEY DO HAVE INFORMATION THEY

02:25:34.792 --> 02:25:37.095
DO HAVE PLACE NAME INFORMATION

02:25:37.161 --> 02:25:39.230
THEY DO HAVE VALID- HISTORIES

02:25:39.297 --> 02:25:43.101
SONGS LANGUAGE ORAL HISTORIES-

02:25:43.167 --> 02:25:46.671
MY TRIBE WAS RECENTLY- DENIED A

02:25:46.737 --> 02:25:49.040

THE PHOEBE HEARST MUSEUM AND WE

02:25:51.309 --> 02:25:52.510
WERE TOLD THAT OUR ORAL HISTORY

02:25:52.577 --> 02:25:56.214
WAS NICE POETRY. BUT THAT IT

02:25:56.280 --> 02:25:58.883
WASN'T ENOUGH PROOF TO

02:25:58.950 --> 02:26:01.919
ESTABLISH CULTURAL AFFILIATION.

02:26:01.986 --> 02:26:03.521
AND SO THIS JUST YOU KNOW

02:26:03.588 --> 02:26:06.557
HAPPEN AT ABOUT A YEAR AGO SO

02:26:06.624 --> 02:26:10.928
WE'RE TALKING PRESENT DAY.

02:26:10.995 --> 02:26:11.395

NAVIGATE THE SYSTEM'S BUT

02:26:19.637 --> 02:26:21.239
UNFORTUNATELY SOME OF THE

02:26:21.305 --> 02:26:24.108
ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS ARE FEVER

02:26:24.175 --> 02:26:26.444

OPINIONS OVER THE TRIBAL

02:26:28.579 --> 02:26:30.314
KNOWLEDGE AND SO WE'RE TRYING

02:26:30.381 --> 02:26:32.550

INFORMED AND ALSO HAD A LOT

02:34:53.317 --> 02:34:54.785
MORE TEETH THAN THAT PRESS

02:34:54.852 --> 02:34:55.986
ANYTHING AND ACTUALLY THAN THE

02:34:56.053 --> 02:34:57.388
CURRENT CAL MAG PRESS. AND IT

02:34:57.454 --> 02:34:59.790
ACTUALLY HAD IN IT- FINES FOR

02:34:59.857 --> 02:35:01.392
INSTITUTIONS THAT DIDN'T

AND HE ACTUALLY PASSED IT

02:35:06.063 --> 02:35:07.831
BECAUSE AT THE TIME HE WAS

02:35:07.898 --> 02:35:09.533

PASSED IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE

02:35:23.514 --> 02:35:24.481
AND WAS GOING TO BE APPROVED IN

02:35:24.548 --> 02:35:26.250
AT THE TIME GOVERNOR DEUKMEJIAN

VETOED IT. AND HE DID THAT

02:35:28.385 --> 02:35:30.087
BECAUSE THE UC SYSTEM STEPPED

02:35:30.154 --> 02:35:31.822
IN AND WROTE A SERIES OF

02:35:31.889 --> 02:35:32.756

LEGISLATION THAT ACTUALLY IS

02:36:08.325 --> 02:36:09.927
REALLY POWERFUL FOR THE RETURN
