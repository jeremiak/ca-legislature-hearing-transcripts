00:36:18.175 --> 00:36:19.777
THAT WILL HELP WORKING FAMILIES.

00:36:19.844 --> 00:36:21.279
WITH THE CONTINUES THE RISING

00:36:21.345 --> 00:36:23.514
COST OF HOUSING AND THE EVER

00:36:23.581 --> 00:36:25.583
GROWING PROBLEM OF INCOME

00:36:25.650 --> 00:36:27.084
INEQUALITY IN THE STATE.

00:36:27.151 --> 00:36:28.452
THE PREVAILING WAGE UNSKILLED

00:36:28.519 --> 00:36:30.121
UNTRAINED ARE PROVISIONS ARE

00:36:30.187 --> 00:36:31.856
IMPORTANT LABOR PROTECTIONS THAT

00:36:31.923 --> 00:36:33.090
ARE ONLY LEAD TO GOOD

00:36:33.157 --> 00:36:34.692
CONSTRUCTION BUT ALSO ENSURE

00:36:34.759 --> 00:36:36.127
THAT THIS CRITICALLY NEEDED.

00:36:36.193 --> 00:36:37.194
THESE GRILL YOU NEED A PROJECTS

00:36:37.261 --> 00:36:38.829
ARE BUILT WITH THE HIGHEST GUILD

00:36:38.896 --> 00:36:41.132
LABOR -- THAT IS AVAILABLE AND

00:36:41.198 --> 00:36:42.533
ALSO ADDRESSES THE WORK FOR

00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:43.601
SHORTAGE BY ENSURING THAT

00:36:43.668 --> 00:36:45.102
THERE'S APPRENTICES ACTUALLY ON

00:36:45.169 --> 00:36:47.371
THOSE JOBS SO THAT ALSO ALLOWS A

00:36:47.438 --> 00:36:48.639
LOT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE EXITING

00:36:48.706 --> 00:36:49.473
THE HIGH SCHOOLS IN GOING

00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:49.974
THROUGH.

THAT STATE APPROVED SYSTEM.

00:36:54.845 --> 00:36:56.581
WE BELIEVE THIS IS COMPLEMENTARY

00:36:56.647 --> 00:36:57.815
TO THE GOVERNOR'S HOUSING GOALS

00:36:57.882 --> 00:36:59.150
AND PROVIDE NEW OPPORTUNITIES

00:36:59.216 --> 00:37:00.384
FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND THE

00:37:00.451 --> 00:37:02.153
PRIVATE SECTOR TO WORK TOGETHER

00:37:02.219 --> 00:37:03.354
TO REVITALIZE COMMUNITIES AND

00:37:03.421 --> 00:37:06.624
BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR

00:37:06.691 --> 00:37:07.158
THESE REASONS WE URGE YOUR

00:37:07.224 --> 00:37:08.993
SUPPORT.

00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:09.961
MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS JASON RILEY

00:37:10.027 --> 00:37:11.462
CALIFORNIA CITIES AND WE'VE

00:37:11.529 --> 00:37:12.830
TOUCHED ON A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

00:37:12.897 --> 00:37:14.131
THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT'S IN

00:37:14.198 --> 00:37:15.266
THE THE BUDGET THIS YEAR AND I

00:37:15.333 --> 00:37:16.767
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. TO TO

00:37:16.834 --> 00:37:18.502
REALLY FOCUS IN ON ON AN ITEM

00:37:18.569 --> 00:37:19.770
THAT YOU KNOW YOU CARE DEEPLY

00:37:19.837 --> 00:37:20.671
ABOUT OVER THE YEARS IN A FOUGHT

00:37:20.738 --> 00:37:22.773
EVERY YEAR FOR AND THAT'S THE

00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:23.240
TAX CREDIT PROGRAM.

00:37:23.307 --> 00:37:24.709
ON THE FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN

00:37:24.775 --> 00:37:25.343
THERE WHICH I THINK IS IS QUITE

00:37:25.409 --> 00:37:26.911
SIGNIFICANT I'M WHILE IT IS ONE

00:37:26.978 --> 00:37:27.979
TIME FUNDING YOU KNOW IT WE

00:37:28.045 --> 00:37:29.714
CERTAINLY SUPPORT THAT EFFORT

00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:30.247
AND GRADUALLY YOU IN YOUR

00:37:30.314 --> 00:37:32.617
EFFORTS. TO TO GET THAT INCLUDED

00:37:32.683 --> 00:37:34.085
SB FIVE REALLY BUILDS OFF THAT

00:37:34.151 --> 00:37:35.953
IN SB FIVE WOULD WOULD BE A LONG

00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:36.887
TERM PARTNERSHIP WITH LOCAL

00:37:36.954 --> 00:37:37.688
GOVERNMENT.

00:37:37.755 --> 00:37:38.756
AND I THINK IT'S REALLY

00:37:38.823 --> 00:37:40.591
IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT YOU KNOW

00:37:40.658 --> 00:37:41.192
CITY SOMETIMES ARE BLAMED FOR

00:37:41.258 --> 00:37:42.627
PUTTING A BEARS AND AND NOT

00:37:42.693 --> 00:37:43.995
WANTING TO TO NECESSARILY BE

00:37:44.061 --> 00:37:44.829
PARTNERS WHEN IT COMES TO

00:37:44.895 --> 00:37:45.696

00:37:45.763 --> 00:37:46.497
AFFORDABLE HOUSING HOUSING IN

00:37:46.564 --> 00:37:47.965
GENERAL AND I THINK FROM THIS

00:37:48.032 --> 00:37:49.133
BILL YOU CAN SEE THAT WE HAVE

00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:50.568

PUT UP OUR OWN DOLLARS.

00:37:54.238 --> 00:37:55.306
IF THE STATE'S WILLING TO PUT UP

00:37:55.373 --> 00:37:57.375
SOME OF THEIR DOLLARS AND WE CAN

00:37:57.441 --> 00:37:58.009
TEAM UP AND ACTUALLY YOU KNOW

00:37:58.075 --> 00:37:59.677
ACHIEVE COMMON GOALS AND THOSE

00:37:59.744 --> 00:38:00.811
COMMON GOALS.

00:38:00.878 --> 00:38:01.746
ARE REALLY OUTLINED IN THE BILL

00:38:01.812 --> 00:38:02.747
BUT THEY'RE ALSO OUTLINED IN IN

00:38:02.813 --> 00:38:04.415
PREVIOUS BILLS YOU KNOW IT'S ALL

00:38:04.482 --> 00:38:05.549

00:38:09.487 --> 00:38:09.954
DENSITY.

LORRAINE GHGS THESE ARE ALL

00:38:11.589 --> 00:38:12.890

REALLY IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT

FISCAL PROBLEMS.

00:44:23.293 --> 00:44:27.064
IN THAT IT COULD CREATE A TWO

00:44:27.131 --> 00:44:29.299
BILLION DOLLAR A YEAR --

THE FUNDING STREAM.

00:44:37.341 --> 00:44:40.511
THAT MEANS THAT IN TIMES OF

00:44:40.577 --> 00:44:44.948
RECESSION -- YOU'VE GOT.

00:44:45.015 --> 00:44:45.883

00:44:48.552 --> 00:44:49.453
PAYING OFF THOSE BONDS WERE

HAS TO GO TO HOUSING.

00:45:13.877 --> 00:45:16.480
WE THINK IT IS SUPERIOR TO HAVE

00:45:16.547 --> 00:45:18.148
A GRANT PROGRAM.

00:45:18.215 --> 00:45:19.516

IMPACTS SCHOOL FINANCE.

00:49:24.695 --> 00:49:26.163
AND THEY HAVE SUBMITTED A

00:49:26.229 --> 00:49:28.565
WRITTEN REPORT THAT YOU CAN READ

00:49:28.632 --> 00:49:30.467
THAT ACTUALLY INDICATES.

00:49:30.534 --> 00:49:31.868
THAT THE BILL WILL HAVE NO

00:49:31.935 --> 00:49:33.770
FISCAL IMPACT ON THE SCHOOL

00:49:33.837 --> 00:49:35.105
BECAUSE IT'S COMPLETELY BACK

00:49:35.172 --> 00:49:36.306
FILLED.

00:49:36.373 --> 00:49:38.275

DIVERTED TO THESE PROGRAMS.

00:49:48.485 --> 00:49:52.656
SO IN ESSENCE -- THERE IS NO

00:49:52.723 --> 00:49:55.459
IMPACT ON SCHOOLS -- WE ALSO

00:49:55.525 --> 00:50:02.366
HAVE -- LOOKED AT THE ISSUE OF

FILL IN AN AND TELL US ONE YEARS

00:50:20.016 --> 00:50:21.718
WHICH IS THE WHEN IT GETS KIND

00:50:21.785 --> 00:50:24.588
OF TIGHT -- THE BILL CALLS FOR

00:50:24.654 --> 00:50:25.856
THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE TO RE

00:50:25.922 --> 00:50:27.657
BRANCH THE PROP NINETY EIGHT

00:50:27.724 --> 00:50:29.960

00:50:30.026 --> 00:50:31.561
NO DOLLARS ARE LOST TO THE

00:50:31.628 --> 00:50:32.462
SCHOOLS.

00:50:32.529 --> 00:50:34.398
THE LEGISLATURE ALSO UNDER THIS

00:50:34.464 --> 00:50:35.999
BILL THE LEGISLATURE IN THE

00:50:36.066 --> 00:50:36.800
GOVERNOR.

00:50:36.867 --> 00:50:38.435
CAN'T SUSPEND APPROVAL OF NEW

00:50:38.502 --> 00:50:41.238
PLANTS DURING FISCAL DOWNTURNS

00:50:41.304 --> 00:50:43.373
WHEN THERE'S A RAINY DAY -- FUND

00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:44.708
OR WHEN PROP NINETY EIGHT IS

00:50:44.775 --> 00:50:47.611
SUSPENDED SUSPENDED SPECIFICALLY

00:50:47.677 --> 00:50:49.112
SAYS THAT YOU CAN.

00:50:49.179 --> 00:50:53.016
OF SUSPEND THIS THIS -- PROGRAM.

00:50:53.083 --> 00:50:55.752
SO -- WE HAVE PUT THOSE

00:50:55.819 --> 00:51:00.524
GUARANTEES IN THE BILL -- I I

00:51:00.590 --> 00:51:03.860
THINK DID -- OF GUARANTEEING

00:51:03.927 --> 00:51:08.331
THAT -- IS REFERABLE.

00:51:08.398 --> 00:51:10.534
TO JUST LETTING -- REDEVELOPMENT

00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:13.804
TAX INCREMENTS -- IN.

00:51:13.870 --> 00:51:15.906
REDUCE THE PROPERTY TAX AND I

00:51:15.972 --> 00:51:17.441
KNOW THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS

00:51:17.507 --> 00:51:20.043
APPROVED -- BECAUSE I'M ON THE

00:51:20.110 --> 00:51:21.178
GOVERNMENT FINANCE COMMITTEE

00:51:21.244 --> 00:51:22.946
WHICH IS MADE A FEW MINUTES --

00:51:23.013 --> 00:51:24.448
WE HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED

00:51:24.514 --> 00:51:25.749
SOMETHING LIKE EIGHT OR NINE

00:51:25.816 --> 00:51:27.117
BILLS.

00:51:27.184 --> 00:51:28.652
THAT ACTUALLY.

00:51:28.718 --> 00:51:31.087
DO MUCH MORE PROPERTY TAX

00:51:31.154 --> 00:51:32.322
DIVERSION IN THIS BILL BECAUSE

00:51:32.389 --> 00:51:33.824
THIS BILL HAS NO PROPERTY TAX

00:51:33.890 --> 00:51:36.927
DIVERSION -- THAT WILL NOT BE

00:51:36.993 --> 00:51:38.728
BACK FILLED BY THE GENERAL FUND.

00:51:38.795 --> 00:51:42.799
SO SO THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHY --

00:51:42.866 --> 00:51:45.202
WE PROPOSE THIS BILL SO WE WOULD

00:51:45.268 --> 00:51:47.537
GUARANEE THE SCHOOLS FUNDING --

00:51:47.604 --> 00:51:49.005
THE OTHER ISSUE MAYBE OF CAN

00:51:49.072 --> 00:51:50.941
RESTED EMINENT DOMAIN ISSUE THIS

00:51:51.007 --> 00:51:52.375
BILL DOES NOT ADDRESS THE ISSUE

00:51:52.442 --> 00:51:54.377
IN A DONE AND WE WE DID NOT

00:51:54.444 --> 00:51:56.079
CHANGE THE CURRENT LAW.

00:51:56.146 --> 00:51:57.914
ON ANNA DOMAINS WE DID NOT

00:51:57.981 --> 00:52:00.984
CREATE -- ANY CHANGES IN IN --

00:52:01.051 --> 00:52:02.586
DOMAIN FOR ANY OF THESE ENTITIES --

00:52:02.652 --> 00:52:04.688
SO WE DO NOT ADDRESS THAT

00:52:04.754 --> 00:52:08.625
PARTICULAR ISSUE -- IN THE BILL

00:52:08.692 --> 00:52:11.495
AND I THINK THAT -- THE OTHER

00:52:11.561 --> 00:52:14.798
ISSUE I WANT TO POINT OUT IS --

00:52:14.865 --> 00:52:17.767
IN A DOMAIN HAS BEEN USED.

00:52:17.834 --> 00:52:20.670
WHEN OF REDEVELOPMENT STYLE

00:52:20.737 --> 00:52:23.306
DEVELOPMENT OCCURS WHEN THEY DO

00:52:23.373 --> 00:52:26.743
CLEARING A PROPERTY -- THEY'RE

00:52:26.810 --> 00:52:29.346
TRYING TO GET TAX INCREMENTS --

00:52:29.412 --> 00:52:31.381
DEVELOPMENTS WITH REDEVELOPMENT

00:52:31.448 --> 00:52:33.517
KIND OF PROJECTS THIS BILL DOES

00:52:33.583 --> 00:52:34.918
NOT.

00:52:34.985 --> 00:52:37.587
FOCUS ON THOSE KINDS OF PROJECTS

00:52:37.654 --> 00:52:39.723
THIS BILL FOCUSES ON BUILDING

00:52:39.789 --> 00:52:41.224
AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN

00:52:41.291 --> 00:52:43.493
PARTNERSHIP WITH CITIES.

00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:45.662
AND COUNTIES AND OTHER ENTITIES

00:52:45.729 --> 00:52:46.329
THAT CAN BUILD AFFORDABLE

00:52:46.396 --> 00:52:47.063
HOUSING.

00:52:47.130 --> 00:52:48.665
SO THIS BILL IS NOT A

00:52:48.732 --> 00:52:50.100
REDEVELOPMENT BILL.

00:52:50.166 --> 00:52:52.202
IS NOT A TAX INCREMENT FINANCE

00:52:52.269 --> 00:52:55.572
BILL IT IS NOT A BILL THAT --

00:52:55.639 --> 00:52:58.608
CLEARS LAND AND EMPHASIZES THAT

00:52:58.675 --> 00:52:59.809
THIS BILL EMPHASIZES.

00:52:59.876 --> 00:53:01.778
BUILDING THE HOUSING IN EXISTING

00:53:01.845 --> 00:53:03.880
COMMUNITIES AND BUILDING YOU

00:53:03.947 --> 00:53:05.582
KNOW FOR EXAMPLE BUILDING STRONG

00:53:05.649 --> 00:53:09.653
NEIGHBORHOODS -- BUILDING -- OF

00:53:09.719 --> 00:53:11.221
TRANSIT OR IN DEVELOPMENT INFILL

00:53:11.288 --> 00:53:12.355
DEVELOPMENT THOSE KINDS OF

00:53:12.422 --> 00:53:14.724
PROJECTS AS OPPOSED TO A

00:53:14.791 --> 00:53:16.059
REDEVELOPMENT STYLE.

00:53:16.126 --> 00:53:18.194
OF DEVELOPMENT SO I THINK I

00:53:18.261 --> 00:53:20.130
THINK READ YOU KNOW I CHAIR THE

00:53:20.196 --> 00:53:21.264
REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY IN SAN JOSE.

00:53:21.331 --> 00:53:22.198
WE HAD THE SECOND LARGEST

00:53:22.265 --> 00:53:23.934
REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY IN THE IN

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:25.368
THE IN THE STATE.

00:53:25.435 --> 00:53:28.572
AND THIS BILL IS NOT

00:53:28.638 --> 00:53:29.406
REDEVELOPMENT.

00:53:29.472 --> 00:53:30.073
THIS IS SOMETHING DIFFERENT THIS

00:53:30.140 --> 00:53:32.242
IS A NEW APPROACH TO IMPROVING

00:53:32.309 --> 00:53:33.944
OUR COMMUNITY.

00:53:34.010 --> 00:53:34.811
THANK YOU FOR THAT AND I WILL

00:53:34.878 --> 00:53:36.313
NOTE THAT I THINK IN A LOT OF

00:53:36.379 --> 00:53:38.748
CASES THESE ARE BOTH COMPELLING

00:53:38.815 --> 00:53:40.450
AND COMPETING INTERESTS -- A IN

00:53:40.517 --> 00:53:41.818
SOME WAYS BECAUSE IT IS THE SAME

00:53:41.885 --> 00:53:44.154
STUDENTS -- THAT I HAVE FOUND AS

00:53:44.220 --> 00:53:45.589
A FORMER EDUCATOR AT WHO DON'T

00:53:45.655 --> 00:53:47.424
HAVE HOUSING -- SOME OF THE

00:53:47.490 --> 00:53:49.726
STUDENTS AT SCHOOLS WITH ELL CFF --

00:53:49.793 --> 00:53:51.595
ARE THE ONES THAT ARE LIVING IN

00:53:51.661 --> 00:53:54.130
LOW INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS SHARING --

00:53:54.197 --> 00:53:56.299
ROOMS IN HOME SO I THINK IT'S

00:53:56.366 --> 00:53:58.768
IT'S AN IMPORTANT ISSUE TO

00:53:58.835 --> 00:54:00.837
RECOGNIZE THAT. TO BETTER SERVE --

00:54:00.904 --> 00:54:02.505
OUR STUDENTS WE ALSO HAVE TO

00:54:02.572 --> 00:54:03.840
ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE HOUSING

00:54:03.907 --> 00:54:04.874
AND THEIR FAMILIES HAVE HOUSING

00:54:04.941 --> 00:54:08.545
AS WELL -- SO I THINK YOU FOR

BILL FORWARD.

00:54:18.488 --> 00:54:20.590
COULD YOU AKE A COMMENT ON THE

00:54:20.657 --> 00:54:22.926
BONDS BECAUSE THERE WAS SOME

00:54:22.993 --> 00:54:25.095
INFERENCE RELATED TO THE BONDS

00:54:25.161 --> 00:54:29.032

00:54:29.099 --> 00:54:31.868
THE STATE BONDS -- OKAY.

00:54:31.935 --> 00:54:33.903
THIS BILL DOES NOT ENGAGE OR

ALLOW OR CREATE STATE BONDING.

00:54:38.041 --> 00:54:39.442

00:54:51.287 --> 00:54:52.722
THINGS ALLOW.

00:54:52.789 --> 00:54:55.692
THE LOCAL ENTITY TO DO USE THAT

00:54:55.759 --> 00:54:58.228
REVENUE SOURCE TO BOND THIS DOES

00:54:58.294 --> 00:55:00.296

THAT -- THE MONEY CAN BE USED

00:55:13.777 --> 00:55:16.546
FOR BONDING IT DOES NOT PRECLUDE

00:55:16.613 --> 00:55:17.881
THAT.

00:55:17.947 --> 00:55:19.883
OKAY SO IT'S IS SERVE AN OPT IN

00:57:00.550 --> 00:57:02.185
FUNDING BUT ON THE OTHER HAND

00:57:02.252 --> 00:57:03.953
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE BASIC NEEDS

00:57:04.020 --> 00:57:07.357
OF FAMILIES AND WE LOOK AT WHAT

00:57:07.423 --> 00:57:09.359
COMES FIRST IF THE FAMILY

00:57:09.425 --> 00:57:10.960
DOESN'T HAVE A HOME.

00:57:11.027 --> 00:57:12.762
AND THEY CANNOT I HAVE ANY

00:57:12.829 --> 00:57:15.031
CERTAINLY OF WHERE THEY'RE GOING

00:57:15.098 --> 00:57:16.966
TO BE AT NIGHT WHETHER IT'S ON A

00:57:17.033 --> 00:57:19.402
COUCH WHETHER LIVING WITH THREE

00:57:19.469 --> 00:57:22.872
OR FOUR FAMILIES IN A ONE TO TWO

00:57:22.939 --> 00:57:23.573
BEDROOM.

00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:25.275
APARTMENT AND BY THE WAY THAT

00:57:25.341 --> 00:57:26.843
HAPPENS IN NORTH ORANGE COUNTY

00:57:26.910 --> 00:57:28.812
IN FULLERTON BECAUSE I WORKED IN

00:57:28.878 --> 00:57:31.014
AND TAUGHT AT THE HIGHEST TITLE

00:57:31.080 --> 00:57:33.216
ONE SCHOOL WITH ALMOST A

00:57:33.283 --> 00:57:35.051
THOUSAND OF A SECOND LANGUAGE

00:57:35.118 --> 00:57:36.152
LEARNERS.

00:57:36.219 --> 00:57:38.054
THEN IT MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT

00:57:38.121 --> 00:57:40.156
FOR THAT EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE

00:57:40.223 --> 00:57:41.825
EVEN IF WE INVEST WITH LOCAL

00:57:41.891 --> 00:57:43.760
CONTROL FUNDING BECAUSE WE GOT

00:57:43.827 --> 00:57:44.894
TO GET THEM TO SCHOOL.

00:57:44.961 --> 00:57:46.029
WE GOT TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE

00:57:46.095 --> 00:57:47.864
SOMETHING TO EAT WE HAVE TO MAKE

00:57:47.931 --> 00:57:49.766
SURE THAT IN MANY SCHOOLS I CAN

00:57:49.833 --> 00:57:51.467
WEAR A UNIFORM TO GET THERE SO

00:57:51.534 --> 00:57:52.669
EVERYTHING THAT COMES WITH

00:57:52.735 --> 00:57:54.571
EDUCATION ABOUT READING WRITING

00:57:54.637 --> 00:57:55.505
AND MATH.

00:57:55.572 --> 00:57:57.440
COME SECONDARY TO YOUR BASIC

00:57:57.507 --> 00:57:59.642
NEEDS OF WHERE WE GONNA LIVE THE

00:57:59.709 --> 00:58:01.477
SECOND PART OF THAT IS TEACHERS

00:58:01.544 --> 00:58:04.247
ARE ALSO PART OF THIS.

00:58:04.314 --> 00:58:08.451
NEW -- GROWING COMMUNITY THAT

00:58:08.518 --> 00:58:10.253
CANNOT AFFORD HOUSING IN THE

00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:11.588
AREAS THEY TEACH WHETHER IT'S

00:58:11.654 --> 00:58:13.056
OAKLAND OR SAN FRANCISCO OR

00:58:13.122 --> 00:58:16.326
ORANGE COUNTY SO THIS IS NOT --

00:58:16.392 --> 00:58:18.394
SIMPLY -- LET'S PUSH THIS ALONG

00:58:18.461 --> 00:58:19.095
BECAUSE WE WANT TO DO MORE

00:58:19.162 --> 00:58:21.865
HOUSING THIS IS A CRISIS EVERY

00:58:21.931 --> 00:58:24.267
SINGLE DAY -- NOT ONLY HERE IN

00:58:24.334 --> 00:58:26.202
SACRAMENTO BUT THROUGHOUT THE

00:58:26.269 --> 00:58:28.438
STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE ARE

00:58:28.504 --> 00:58:30.373
EXPERIENCING CRISIS THAT SHOULD

00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:33.343
BE NOTED AS A MORAL CRISIS AND

00:58:33.409 --> 00:58:35.712
INTEL WE START DOING THE ACTION

00:58:35.778 --> 00:58:37.680
THAT IS NECESSARY WE ARE NOT

00:58:37.747 --> 00:58:38.882
GOING TO HAVE KIDS SITTING IN

00:58:38.948 --> 00:58:40.383
CLASSROOMS.

00:58:40.450 --> 00:58:41.284
BECAUSE THEY CAN'T EVEN GET

00:58:41.351 --> 00:58:42.252
THERE.

00:58:42.318 --> 00:58:44.888
AND SO -- WHEN WE HAVE SAID

00:58:44.954 --> 00:58:46.522
LOCAL GOVERNMENT?

00:58:46.589 --> 00:58:47.724
SCHOOL DISTRICTS NEED TO MAKE

00:58:47.790 --> 00:58:50.293
THEIR OWN DISICK DECISIONS THEY

00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:51.594
HAVE TO ACCOUNT THAT IF CAN

00:58:51.661 --> 00:58:53.529
FAMILIES CANNOT GET THEIR KIDS

00:58:53.596 --> 00:58:55.198
TO SCHOOL BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO

00:58:55.265 --> 00:58:56.566
PLACE TO CALL HOME.

00:58:56.633 --> 00:58:58.968
THEN WE HAVE TO TAKE THIS AS A

00:58:59.035 --> 00:59:01.137
PRIORITY AND PERHAPS IT SWITCHES

00:59:01.204 --> 00:59:02.572
AROUND ONCE WE MAKE THIS HOUSING

00:59:02.639 --> 00:59:05.108
INVESTMENT -- AND WE CONTINUE TO

00:59:05.174 --> 00:59:06.609
INVEST IN EDUCATION WE WON'T

00:59:06.676 --> 00:59:07.710
CONTINUE TO HAVE THESE

00:59:07.777 --> 00:59:12.849
CONVERSATIONS SO I SUPPORT THIS

00:59:12.916 --> 00:59:15.318
AND MOVE THE BILL FORWARD.

00:59:15.385 --> 00:59:16.886

THAT'S NECESSARY TO CARRY OUT A

00:59:51.120 --> 00:59:52.555
PROJECT AS POTENTIALLY

00:59:52.622 --> 00:59:56.159
ENCOMPASSING EMINENT DOMAIN DO

00:59:56.225 --> 00:59:56.592
YOU AGREE WITH THAT

00:59:56.659 --> 00:59:58.361
INTERPRETATION [inaudible]

00:59:58.428 --> 01:00:00.263
WELL.

01:00:00.330 --> 01:00:01.965
WHAT I SAY ABOUT EMINENT DOMAIN

01:00:02.031 --> 01:00:03.733
ON THIS IS?

01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:05.501
THERE ARE OTHER SECTIONS OF THE

01:00:05.568 --> 01:00:07.503
BILL THAT.

01:00:07.570 --> 01:00:09.138
WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE ISSUE OF

01:00:09.205 --> 01:00:11.040
EMINENT DOMAIN SHOULD LOOK OUT?

01:00:11.107 --> 01:00:12.542
OF FOR EXAMPLE.

01:00:12.608 --> 01:00:14.043
IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THAT

01:00:14.110 --> 01:00:16.245
THE BILL'S FOCUSES ON BUILDING

01:00:16.312 --> 01:00:18.014
IN FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

01:00:18.081 --> 01:00:20.049
NOT A BLIGHT OR COMMERCIAL

01:00:20.116 --> 01:00:21.284
DEVELOPMENT.

01:00:21.351 --> 01:00:23.119
THAT'S NOT THE EMPHASIS OF THIS

01:00:23.186 --> 01:00:24.187
BILL IT'S THE FORD ABOUT HOUSING.

01:00:24.253 --> 01:00:26.522
THERE ARE SECTIONS OF THIS BILL

01:00:26.589 --> 01:00:28.458
THAT ALSO INCLUDE TENANT

01:00:28.524 --> 01:00:29.993
PROTECTION SUCH AS ANTI

01:00:30.059 --> 01:00:31.327
DISPLACEMENT.

01:00:31.394 --> 01:00:35.698
PROTECTIONSOF THIS -- BILL DOES

01:00:35.765 --> 01:00:38.434
NOT CHANGE CURRENT STATUTES ON

01:00:38.501 --> 01:00:39.802
EMINENT DOMAIN.

01:00:39.869 --> 01:00:43.306
OF THAT COULD BE A FULL.

01:00:43.373 --> 01:00:44.707
DISCUSSION IF WE WANT TO HAVE

01:00:44.774 --> 01:00:46.175
THAT PHILOSOPHICAL DISCUSSION SO

01:00:46.242 --> 01:00:49.412
THIS THIS BILL IS SORT OF

01:00:49.479 --> 01:00:53.750
NEUTRAL -- ON IT IT DOES PROVIDE.

01:00:53.816 --> 01:00:57.353
FINANCING FOR PROJECTS.

01:00:57.420 --> 01:00:58.955
AND THE FINANCING OF THE

01:00:59.022 --> 01:00:59.822
PROJECTS.

01:00:59.889 --> 01:01:01.891
OF WHICH ARE GOOD PROJECTS

01:01:01.958 --> 01:01:03.893
HOUSING AND SO FORTH --

01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:05.962
CONCEIVABLY COULD USE EMINENT

01:01:06.029 --> 01:01:07.563
DOMAIN OKAY.

01:01:07.630 --> 01:01:09.932
BUT IN TERMS OF THE TENET

01:01:09.999 --> 01:01:12.568
PROTECTIONS IF THE HOUSING IS IN

01:01:12.635 --> 01:01:15.772
AN AREA THAT'S TYPICALLY ZONE

01:01:15.838 --> 01:01:17.407
RESIDENTIAL.

01:01:17.473 --> 01:01:19.208
AND THERE'S PEOPLE LIVING THERE

01:01:19.275 --> 01:01:20.743
THERE'S TENER PROTECTIONS IN

01:01:20.810 --> 01:01:23.579
ANTI DISPLACEMENT -- CLAUSES IN

01:01:23.646 --> 01:01:25.848
THE BILL THAT PROBABLY WOULD

01:01:25.915 --> 01:01:28.184
RESULT IN NO EMINENT DOMAIN.

01:01:28.251 --> 01:01:30.053
ON THOSE ON THE AND THAT KIND OF

01:01:30.119 --> 01:01:32.688
PROJECTS SO IT'S A IT'S A IT'S A

01:01:32.755 --> 01:01:34.123
BILL THAT WOULD LIMIT THEM A

01:01:34.190 --> 01:01:37.026
DOMAIN BY THOSE MEANS.

01:01:37.093 --> 01:01:39.362
SO IT ACTUALLY -- AS OPPOSED TO

01:01:39.429 --> 01:01:40.930
OTHER.

01:01:40.997 --> 01:01:42.398
TYPES OF FINANCING.

01:01:42.465 --> 01:01:44.500
ACTUALLY DISCOURAGES EMINENT

01:01:44.567 --> 01:01:46.469
DOMAIN IN MY OPINION OKAY THAT'S

01:01:46.536 --> 01:01:48.004
MY ANSWER QUESTIONS DOES NOT

01:01:48.071 --> 01:01:49.705
PRECLUDE IT BUT IT DISCOURAGES

01:01:49.772 --> 01:01:50.440
IT.

01:01:50.506 --> 01:01:52.275
IS CERTAINLY DISCOURAGES AT MORE

01:01:52.341 --> 01:01:55.478
THAN OTHER ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT --

01:01:55.545 --> 01:01:56.446
STATUES THAT WE HAVE ON THE

01:01:56.512 --> 01:01:57.980
BOOKS.

01:01:58.047 --> 01:01:59.682
THAT ENCOURAGE -- ECONOMIC

01:01:59.749 --> 01:02:02.585
DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS SO.

01:02:02.652 --> 01:02:03.586
WOULD THERE BE A WAY TO MAKE IT

01:02:03.653 --> 01:02:04.987
SORT OF MORE EXPLICIT IN THE

01:02:05.054 --> 01:02:08.024
BILL THAT -- IS THE APPROVAL OF

01:02:08.091 --> 01:02:10.760
PROJECTS -- WILL AT LEAST TAKE

01:02:10.827 --> 01:02:12.528
INTO ACCOUNT -- LIMITS ON THE

01:02:12.595 --> 01:02:14.363
USE OF EMINENT DOMAIN OR OR

01:02:14.430 --> 01:02:15.431
OTHERWISE PUT SAFEGUARDS IN A

01:02:15.498 --> 01:02:17.200
PLACE WHERE THEY CAN WE DID THAT

01:02:17.266 --> 01:02:19.836
WOULD HAVE A A MAJOR BLOW UP THE

01:02:19.902 --> 01:02:21.471
ISSUE AND HAVE A MAJOR.

01:02:21.537 --> 01:02:23.206
DISCUSSION.

01:02:23.272 --> 01:02:25.608
OF ON ON THE SUBJECT OF AN

01:02:25.675 --> 01:02:27.343
INTIMATE.

01:02:27.410 --> 01:02:29.245
I THINK -- DO YOU WANT TO HAVE

01:02:29.312 --> 01:02:31.714
THE I'VE NEVER SEEN A PROPOSAL

01:02:31.781 --> 01:02:34.317
TO DO THAT -- NOBODY'S GIVEN ME

01:02:34.383 --> 01:02:36.919
A PROPOSAL TO DO THAT SO I WOULD

01:02:36.986 --> 01:02:38.955
SUGGEST THAT THE BILL IS REALLY

01:02:39.021 --> 01:02:40.890
LIMITED AND DOMAIN -- YOU SHOULD

01:02:40.957 --> 01:02:43.526

DECIDE ON HOW YOU WANT TO ACT ON

01:02:45.661 --> 01:02:46.162

MEMBER OF THE THE CITY COUNCIL

01:04:09.712 --> 01:04:10.780
TO GO AND LOOK FOR A CAR

01:04:10.846 --> 01:04:13.449
DEALERSHIP OR ANY KIND OF OF

01:04:13.516 --> 01:04:16.719
SALES TAX.

01:04:16.786 --> 01:04:18.788
GENERATING.

01:04:18.854 --> 01:04:20.423
IS IS IS AND AND AND WERE

01:04:20.489 --> 01:04:21.824
CONCERNED THAT WITHOUT WILL --

01:04:21.891 --> 01:04:23.125
SPECIFIC LANGUAGE IN YOUR BILL

01:04:23.192 --> 01:04:26.229
THAT WOULD AT LEAST -- PRE VET

01:04:26.295 --> 01:04:28.998
LOCAL GOVERNMENT FROM.

01:04:29.065 --> 01:04:30.199
THE SIZING AMADOR ME.

01:04:30.266 --> 01:04:33.002
OF FOR A TO TO TO TAKE PROPERTY

01:04:33.069 --> 01:04:35.438
AWAY FROM ONE OF PRIVATE ENTITY

01:04:35.504 --> 01:04:37.640
TO GIVE TO ANOTHER ONE FOR

01:04:37.707 --> 01:04:38.441
COMMERCIAL USE.

01:04:38.507 --> 01:04:39.408
OF THAT'S THAT THAT'S OUR

01:04:39.475 --> 01:04:40.743
CONCERN AND AND AND AND I KNOW

01:04:40.810 --> 01:04:42.311
THAT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU

01:04:42.378 --> 01:04:45.214
WANT TO ADDRESS OF RIGHT HERE --

01:04:45.281 --> 01:04:47.917
BUT THAT'S TO SOMETHING THAT I

01:04:47.984 --> 01:04:49.185
FELT REALLY TO SHARE WITH YOU AS

01:04:49.252 --> 01:04:52.622
TO WHY I WILL BE ABLE TO SUPPORT

01:04:52.688 --> 01:04:54.557
YOUR BILL TODAY.

01:04:54.624 --> 01:04:55.725
THE JUST JUST A CORRECTION IF I

01:04:55.791 --> 01:04:57.226
COULD -- THE BILL HAS FIVE

01:04:57.293 --> 01:04:58.861
PURPOSES OF THE BILL --

01:04:58.928 --> 01:05:00.763
INDICATES THAT A MINIMUM OF 50%

01:05:00.830 --> 01:05:02.865
OF THE FUNDS WILL BE USED FOR

01:05:02.932 --> 01:05:04.900
AFFORDABLE HOUSING THEN THERE'S

01:05:04.967 --> 01:05:06.936
FIVE SEPARATE CATEGORIES THAT

01:05:07.003 --> 01:05:09.572
THE MONEY CAN BE USED -- FOR

01:05:09.639 --> 01:05:12.308
THREE OF THE FIVE CATEGORIES

01:05:12.375 --> 01:05:14.577
RELATE TO HOUSING AND AFFORDABLE

01:05:14.644 --> 01:05:15.978
HOUSING OKAY.

01:05:16.045 --> 01:05:18.581
SO -- GENERALLY THE ESTIMATE

01:05:18.648 --> 01:05:20.383
THAT MOST PEOPLE HAVE LOOKED AT

01:05:20.449 --> 01:05:22.285
THE BILL HAVE ANALYZE IT THEY

01:05:22.351 --> 01:05:25.154
BELIEVE BELIEVE THAT ABOUT.

01:05:25.221 --> 01:05:28.190
7075% OF THE EXPENDITURES OVER

01:05:28.257 --> 01:05:30.559
TIME ON THIS BILL WILL BE SPENT

01:05:30.626 --> 01:05:31.994
ON HOUSING OKAY.

01:05:32.061 --> 01:05:33.162
AND THEN THE SECOND THING I LIKE

01:05:33.229 --> 01:05:36.098
TO POINT OUT IS THAT IF YOU'RE

01:05:36.165 --> 01:05:36.966
CITY.

01:05:37.033 --> 01:05:39.135
HAS FAILED TO ACHIEVE ITS

01:05:39.201 --> 01:05:41.003
HOUSING GOALS.

01:05:41.070 --> 01:05:42.938
THERE IS ALSO A PROVISION IN THE

01:05:43.005 --> 01:05:43.906
BILL.

01:05:43.973 --> 01:05:46.475
THAT YOU CAN ONLY OUT OF THE

01:05:46.542 --> 01:05:48.110
FIVE CATEGORIES YOU CAN ONLY

01:05:48.177 --> 01:05:50.713
SPEND ON THREE OF THE CATEGORIES.

01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:52.448
AND THOSE THREE CATEGORIES ARE

01:05:52.515 --> 01:05:53.516
THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING

01:05:53.582 --> 01:05:54.884
CATEGORIES.

01:05:54.950 --> 01:05:57.253
SO IT ACTUALLY IF YOU HAVE NOT

01:05:57.320 --> 01:05:58.654
COMPLIED.

01:05:58.721 --> 01:06:00.823
WITH YOUR HOUSING GOALS.

01:06:00.890 --> 01:06:02.992
YOU HAVE TO SPEND IT ONLY ON THE

01:06:03.059 --> 01:06:04.927
HOUSING CATEGORIES.

01:06:04.994 --> 01:06:07.596
SO SO -- I THINK IT IT ACTUALLY

01:06:07.663 --> 01:06:11.367
ENCOURAGES -- OUR CITIES AND

01:06:11.434 --> 01:06:13.069
OTHER GOVERNMENT ENTITIES TO

01:06:13.135 --> 01:06:14.070
COMPLETE.

01:06:14.136 --> 01:06:15.905
THERE ARE HOUSING --

01:06:15.971 --> 01:06:17.239
REQUIREMENTS.

01:06:17.306 --> 01:06:19.275
AND THAT'S WHY THAT BILL WAS

01:06:19.342 --> 01:06:21.377
ADDED IN YOUR RESPECTIVE

01:06:21.444 --> 01:06:22.878
COMMITTEE AND THE SENATE WE WE

01:06:22.945 --> 01:06:24.613

01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:25.981
SENATE HOUSING COMMITTEE.

01:06:26.048 --> 01:06:29.051

01:06:34.523 --> 01:06:35.624
BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL TODAY AM

01:06:35.691 --> 01:06:36.792
VERY SUPPORTIVE OF WHAT YOU'RE

01:06:36.859 --> 01:06:38.194
TRYING TO DO AROUND.

01:06:38.260 --> 01:06:39.562
INCREASING AFFORDABLE HOUSING

01:06:39.628 --> 01:06:40.830
AND INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING

01:06:40.896 --> 01:06:42.365
PARTICULARLY IN THE WAKE OF HOW

01:06:42.431 --> 01:06:44.133
MANY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS WE LOST

01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:46.736
AFTER THE GREAT RECESSION AND

01:06:46.802 --> 01:06:48.738
THE DEMISE OF OF REDEVELOPMENT --

01:06:48.804 --> 01:06:50.106
I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE

01:06:50.172 --> 01:06:51.474
CREATIVE APPROACH YOU'VE TAKEN

01:06:51.540 --> 01:06:52.174
WITH THIS BILLS YOU KNOW WE HAVE

01:06:52.241 --> 01:06:55.578
A A BILL WITH -- WITH ANALOGOUS --

01:06:55.644 --> 01:06:58.214
GOALS -- AND INTERESTS ARE AB

01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:00.449
ELEVEN BILL -- AND TO LOOK FOR

01:07:00.516 --> 01:07:01.784
MORE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THAT.

01:07:01.851 --> 01:07:03.319
THE ONLY THING I'LL MENTION IS --

01:07:03.386 --> 01:07:04.687
THERE IS A PORTION OF THE

01:07:04.754 --> 01:07:06.155
ANALYSIS THAT RAISES.

01:07:06.222 --> 01:07:07.556
SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT WE

01:07:07.623 --> 01:07:09.125
RECEIVED -- AND I'M SURE YOU

01:07:09.191 --> 01:07:10.993
HAVE AS WELL ABOUT WHETHER THE

01:07:11.060 --> 01:07:12.828
BOND MARKET WILL FIND -- THE

01:07:12.895 --> 01:07:14.130
STRUCTURE SECURE ENOUGH TO

01:07:14.196 --> 01:07:15.664
SUPPORT ISSUE IN DEBT I THINK IT

01:07:15.731 --> 01:07:18.501
IS WORTH CONVERSATIONS IN BOTH

01:07:18.567 --> 01:07:19.568
OF OUR HOUSES WE TRY TO ENGAGE

01:07:19.635 --> 01:07:22.371
IN THESE IDEAS -- WITH ENSURING.

01:07:22.438 --> 01:07:24.173
THAT WERE ACTUALLY ON A TOOT

01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:25.274
TOOT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BOND

01:07:25.341 --> 01:07:26.976
MARKETS TO REACT TO WHAT WE ARE

01:07:27.042 --> 01:07:27.877
DOING.

01:07:27.943 --> 01:07:30.279
UP MY HOPE IS IN THE NEAR TERM

01:07:30.346 --> 01:07:31.614
WITH THE APPROACH IS THAT WE

01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:32.114
HAVE MOVED FOR FROM THIS

01:07:32.181 --> 01:07:33.382
COMMITTING YOURS WE CAN FIND

01:07:33.449 --> 01:07:34.617
WAYS FOR BOTH OF THESE

01:07:34.683 --> 01:07:35.818
APPROACHES TO COMPLEMENT EACH

01:07:35.885 --> 01:07:36.252
OTHER.

01:07:36.318 --> 01:07:38.721
OUTLOOK FOR TO THAT UP WITH THAT --

01:07:38.788 --> 01:07:40.389
WILL BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY A

01:07:40.456 --> 01:07:46.996
LESSER ANY FINAL COMMENTS.

01:07:47.062 --> 01:07:47.630

COMEDIAN LOCAL GOVERNMENT CHIU.

01:08:01.377 --> 01:08:03.379
CHIU I DATE.

01:08:03.446 --> 01:08:05.614

ABSENT MEMBERS I KNOW YOU HAVE A

01:08:18.594 --> 01:08:21.230
SECOND ITEM -- FILE ITEM SIX SB.

01:08:21.297 --> 01:08:22.031
TWO EIGHTY TWO BACK TO YOU

01:08:22.097 --> 01:08:22.331
[inaudible]

01:08:22.398 --> 01:08:24.900
WELL.

01:08:24.967 --> 01:08:26.235
SWITCHING -- KIND OF THE HOUSING

01:08:26.302 --> 01:08:27.203
ISSUE.

01:08:27.269 --> 01:08:28.170
TO ANOTHER SUBJECT THAT'S VERY

01:08:28.237 --> 01:08:30.906
IMPORTANT -- ESPYS TWO EIGHTY

01:08:30.973 --> 01:08:31.440
TWO CRATES THE SUPPORT OF

01:08:31.507 --> 01:08:32.975
HOUSING FOR PERSONS ON PAROLE

01:08:33.042 --> 01:08:34.276
PROGRAM TO SERVE INDIVIDUALS ON

01:08:34.343 --> 01:08:35.544
PAROLE.

01:08:35.611 --> 01:08:37.746
WITH MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS AND

01:08:37.813 --> 01:08:41.851
ALSO FACING HOMELESSNESS WE HAVE --

01:08:41.917 --> 01:08:44.320
A STUDIES MANY STUDIES THAT --

01:08:44.386 --> 01:08:45.087
FORMALLY INCARCERATED

01:08:45.154 --> 01:08:46.956
INDIVIDUALS ARE TEN TIMES MORE

01:08:47.022 --> 01:08:48.357
LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE

01:08:48.424 --> 01:08:50.693
HOMELESSNESS PEOPLE ON PAROLE

01:08:50.759 --> 01:08:52.361
EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS ARE

01:08:52.428 --> 01:08:54.263
SEVEN TIMES MORE LIKELY. TO

01:08:54.330 --> 01:08:57.099
RECIDIVISTS GO BACK INTO

01:08:57.166 --> 01:09:00.336
CRIMINAL JUSTICE BEHAVIOR OF IF

01:09:00.402 --> 01:09:02.571
THEY ARE NOT HOUSE VERSUS THOSE

01:09:02.638 --> 01:09:03.973
THAT OUR HOUSE.

01:09:04.039 --> 01:09:05.941
OF SUPPORT OF HOUSING IS IS A

01:09:06.008 --> 01:09:08.277
PROVEN METHOD OF REDUCING

01:09:08.344 --> 01:09:09.578
RECIDIVISM.

01:09:09.645 --> 01:09:11.614
SO IF HOUSING KEEPS PEOPLE FROM

01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:13.749
GOING BACK TO PRISON WE SHOULD

01:09:13.816 --> 01:09:15.384
TAKE A CLOSE LOOK AT THAT.

01:09:15.451 --> 01:09:18.020
AND WE'VE TRIED WE STARTED THIS

01:09:18.087 --> 01:09:20.322
PROGRAM IS MADE OF WHICH IS

01:09:20.389 --> 01:09:21.557
CALLED THE INTEGRATED SERVICES

01:09:21.624 --> 01:09:23.292
WERE MENTALLY ILL PAROLEES.

01:09:23.359 --> 01:09:25.294
IN IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN

01:09:25.361 --> 01:09:26.495
HOWEVER THE CURRENT PROGRAM IS

01:09:26.562 --> 01:09:28.831
NOT IN LINE WHAT WAS THE

01:09:28.898 --> 01:09:30.466
ORIGINAL LEGISLATIVE INTENT.

01:09:30.533 --> 01:09:34.403
IN 200-018-30050 PARTICIPANTS

01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:36.272
AND IS ONE OF ONLY THREE PEOPLE

01:09:36.338 --> 01:09:38.574
WERE HOMELESS AND THE HOUSING

01:09:38.641 --> 01:09:40.442
THAT THE OR PROVIDED THROUGH

01:09:40.509 --> 01:09:43.679
THIS PROGRAM IS VERY TEMPORARY.

01:09:43.746 --> 01:09:44.713
HOUSING.

01:09:44.780 --> 01:09:48.050
SO WE HAVE A UCLA STUDY IN.

01:09:48.117 --> 01:09:48.617
TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THAT

01:09:48.684 --> 01:09:50.786
FOUND THE THIS PROGRAM TO FAIL

01:09:50.853 --> 01:09:51.987
IT FAILS TO SECRETLY REDUCE

01:09:52.054 --> 01:09:53.355
RECIDIVISM.

01:09:53.422 --> 01:09:54.690
AND THAT'S CONTINUE TO BE

01:09:54.757 --> 01:09:57.893
VALIDATED AS WE OVER OVER TIME.

01:09:57.960 --> 01:10:01.463
SO -- THE PROGRAM ACTUALLY --

01:10:01.530 --> 01:10:03.332
PROVIDES AN AVERAGE OF TEN

01:10:03.399 --> 01:10:05.201
MONTHS OF TREATMENT ON AVERAGE

01:10:05.267 --> 01:10:06.902
BEFORE PEOPLE ARE DROPPING OUT

01:10:06.969 --> 01:10:10.806
OF THE PROGRAM -- THE THE THE

01:10:10.873 --> 01:10:12.675
DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTION SHOES

01:10:12.741 --> 01:10:14.109
USES THIS PROGRAM TO PAY

01:10:14.176 --> 01:10:16.812
ESSENTIALLY A 100% OF THE COST

01:10:16.879 --> 01:10:18.280
OF MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT.

01:10:18.347 --> 01:10:20.883
INSTEAD OF A ROLLING THEM AND

01:10:20.950 --> 01:10:22.885
MEDICARE ALL WHICH IS THE COMMON

01:10:22.952 --> 01:10:23.886
THING THAT HAPPENS NOW WITH FOR

01:10:23.953 --> 01:10:25.020
ALL THESE.

01:10:25.087 --> 01:10:27.923
AND THEY CAN DRAW DOWN A FEDERAL

01:10:27.990 --> 01:10:29.224
MATCH. FOR ONE DOLLAR THEY GET A

01:10:29.291 --> 01:10:30.059
DOLLAR AND FEDERAL FUNDS AT

01:10:30.125 --> 01:10:31.627
LEAST.

01:10:31.694 --> 01:10:33.996
SO IT DOES NOT MAKE A FISCAL

01:10:34.063 --> 01:10:35.598
SENSE TO CONTINUE FUNDING THE

01:10:35.664 --> 01:10:36.899
PROGRAM.

01:10:36.966 --> 01:10:38.467
THAT A 100%.

01:10:38.534 --> 01:10:41.604
IS USED FOR MEDICINE WHEN WE CAN

01:10:41.670 --> 01:10:43.172
GET THEM MORE ALMOST EVERY

01:10:43.238 --> 01:10:44.473
PERSON LEAVING.

01:10:44.540 --> 01:10:46.075
OUR STATE FACILITIES ARE

01:10:46.141 --> 01:10:50.479
ELIGIBLE -- FOR MEDI CAL -- THIS

01:10:50.546 --> 01:10:53.415
BILL RE DIRECTS THE PROGRAM TO

01:10:53.482 --> 01:10:54.516
THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING

01:10:54.583 --> 01:10:56.018
COMMUTE DEVELOPMENT TO PARTNER

01:10:56.085 --> 01:10:57.586
WITH COUNTIES TO ENSURE

01:10:57.653 --> 01:11:00.189
PARTICIPANTS CAN ACCESS.

01:11:00.255 --> 01:11:00.889
THE MENTAL HEALTH AND OTHER

01:11:00.956 --> 01:11:02.725
HEALTH CARE SUBSTANCE ABUSE

01:19:31.700 --> 01:19:34.102
I'VE BEEN A FORMER APPOINTEE OF

01:19:34.169 --> 01:19:36.204
THE LAST THREE GOVERNOR'S

01:19:36.271 --> 01:19:38.740
WORKING WITH PEOPLE -- WITH

01:19:38.807 --> 01:19:43.712
MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES -- THE IS A

01:19:43.778 --> 01:19:45.580
MATH PROGRAM.

01:19:45.647 --> 01:19:47.983
THAT IS A PROGRAM FOR THE

01:19:48.049 --> 01:19:50.619
SEVERELY CHRONICALLY MENTALLY

01:19:50.685 --> 01:19:52.154
ILL.

01:19:52.220 --> 01:19:56.091
AND IT IS NOT ONLY A QUESTION OF

01:19:56.158 --> 01:19:58.960
JUST SAYING HOUSING FIRST.

01:19:59.027 --> 01:20:01.830
THERE ARE MANY PROBLEMS.

01:20:01.897 --> 01:20:04.533
AND THE AVERAGE PER RIDER OF

01:20:04.599 --> 01:20:07.802
HOUSING WHO HAS NOT DEALT WITH

01:20:07.869 --> 01:20:09.337
THIS POPULATION.

01:20:09.404 --> 01:20:13.108
BOB WE BELIEVE THIS POSES A

01:20:13.175 --> 01:20:14.843
MAJOR PROBLEM.

01:20:14.910 --> 01:20:17.646
AND WE THINK THAT THE BRIDGE HAS

01:20:17.712 --> 01:20:20.415
NOT BEEN BUILT TO JUST SAY

01:20:20.482 --> 01:20:22.150
SUPPORTIVE HOUSING.

01:20:22.217 --> 01:20:25.020
YOU HAVE TO HAVE VERY VERY

01:20:25.086 --> 01:20:26.821
STRONG SUPPORT.

01:20:26.888 --> 01:20:29.024
AND IT IS ALSO ONE OF THE

01:20:29.090 --> 01:20:31.993
NOTIONS IN THE BILL INDICATES

01:20:32.060 --> 01:20:33.195
THAT IT.

01:20:33.261 --> 01:20:35.697
FOLKS SHOULD GET MEDIC COW

01:20:35.764 --> 01:20:37.933
CERTAIN COUNTIES ARE NOT

01:20:37.999 --> 01:20:40.969
PROVIDING MEDIC COW FOR THIS

01:20:41.036 --> 01:20:42.671
POPULATION.

01:20:42.737 --> 01:20:44.773
AND SO THE IT'S IT'S IT'S

01:20:44.839 --> 01:20:47.175
IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT AND IT IS

01:20:47.242 --> 01:20:51.479
ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT --

01:20:51.546 --> 01:20:53.982
IN STE IN THOSE COUNTIES WHERE

01:20:54.049 --> 01:20:56.218
THEY ARE NOT ALLOWING THIS KIND

01:20:56.284 --> 01:20:57.619
OF FUNDING.

01:20:57.686 --> 01:21:01.056
IT ALSO REQUIRES A 10% COUNTY

01:21:01.122 --> 01:21:02.190
MATCH.

01:21:02.257 --> 01:21:06.361
AND SO WE THINK THAT.

01:21:06.428 --> 01:21:08.496
ARE WHILE THE END TO IT.

01:21:08.563 --> 01:21:11.766

SUPPORT THAT.

01:21:15.604 --> 01:21:18.473
FINALLY -- THIS IS ONE OF THE

01:21:18.540 --> 01:21:21.509
FEW PROGRAMS WHERE THERE ARE

01:21:21.576 --> 01:21:23.878

01:21:23.945 --> 01:21:25.880

SO WE ARE IN EFFECT WE OPPOSE

01:21:43.832 --> 01:21:47.269

CALIFORNIA HAS A HOUSING CRISIS

WE KNOW THAT WE NEED MORE

IN THE CONTINENTAL UNITED STATES

WE NEED MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

01:34:09.276 --> 01:34:10.878
MOBILE HOMES ARE ONE OF THE FEW

01:34:10.945 --> 01:34:12.446
AFFORDABLE HOUSING OPTIONS WE

DESIGNATE A COMPANION TO LIVE

WITH THEM WITHOUT A FEAT.

01:34:37.471 --> 01:34:37.872
SOME PARK OWNERS HAVE

01:34:37.938 --> 01:34:38.539
INTERPRETED -- THE ONE COMPANION

01:34:38.606 --> 01:34:41.008
PER YEAR AS OF ONE COMPANION

01:34:41.075 --> 01:34:42.910

SECOND OF A MOBILE HOME PARK IS

01:34:50.117 --> 01:34:51.752
DESTROYED BY WILDFIRE OR OTHER

01:34:51.819 --> 01:34:53.554
NATURAL DISASTER THIS BILL WOULD

01:34:53.621 --> 01:34:55.289
OFFER PREVIOUS HOMEOWNERS THE

01:34:55.356 --> 01:34:58.559
FIRST OFFER TO LIVE IN THE PARK

01:34:58.626 --> 01:34:59.593
IF IT IS REBUILT.

01:34:59.660 --> 01:35:01.595
AS WE SEE YEAR ROUND FIRE SEASON

01:35:01.662 --> 01:35:02.630
GLOBAL WARMING LEADING TO

01:35:02.696 --> 01:35:03.764
NUMEROUS CHANGES IN WEATHER

01:35:03.831 --> 01:35:06.467
PATTERNS NATURAL DISASTERS WILL

01:35:06.534 --> 01:35:07.935
BECOME EVEN MORE COMMON.

01:35:08.002 --> 01:35:09.036
IT IS IMPORTANT TO PROTECT

01:35:09.103 --> 01:35:11.205
HOMEOWNERS -- IN MOBILE HOME

01:35:11.272 --> 01:35:13.307
PARKS AND ALLOW THEM TO REBUILD

01:35:13.374 --> 01:35:15.076
THEIR LIVES IF THE PARK

01:35:15.142 --> 01:35:16.444
MANAGEMENT CHOOSES TO REBUILD.

01:35:16.510 --> 01:35:18.612
THIRD THIS BILL PROVIDES A CLEAR

01:35:18.679 --> 01:35:20.114
FRAMEWORK FOR WHAT PARK

01:35:20.181 --> 01:35:20.848
MANAGEMENT.

01:35:20.915 --> 01:35:23.117
SHALL CONSIDER WHEN APPROVING OR

01:35:23.184 --> 01:35:24.785
TONIGHT PROSPECTIVE PURCHASER

01:35:24.852 --> 01:35:26.654
WHAT THE PROSPECTIVE PURCHASERS

01:35:26.720 --> 01:35:28.656
CAN PROVIDE THE PARK MANAGEMENT.

01:35:28.722 --> 01:35:30.257
THE GOALS OF THESE CHANGES ARE

01:35:30.324 --> 01:35:31.358
HELP AUDIBLE CALIFORNIANS

01:35:31.425 --> 01:35:35.463
BECAUSE OF AGE DISABILITY INCOME

01:35:35.529 --> 01:35:37.898
OR SOME COMBINATION THEREOF --

01:35:37.965 --> 01:35:38.532
FOR WHOM THESE MOBILE HOMES ARE

01:35:38.599 --> 01:35:39.467
ONE OF THE LAST VESTIGES OF

01:35:39.533 --> 01:35:41.535
AFFORDABLE OUT HOUSING WOULD BE

01:35:41.602 --> 01:35:42.937
HERE TODAY TESTIFIED SUPPORTERS

01:35:43.003 --> 01:35:44.872
PER STAND CORPORATE COUNSEL FOR

01:35:44.939 --> 01:35:46.540
THE GOLD STATE MANUFACTURED HOME

01:35:46.607 --> 01:35:48.342
HONESTLY.

01:35:48.409 --> 01:35:50.611
GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS

01:35:50.678 --> 01:35:51.912
OF THE COMMITTEE I'M HAPPY TO

01:35:51.979 --> 01:35:53.447
APPEAR BEFORE YOU TODAY TO

01:35:53.514 --> 01:35:54.882
REQUEST DRIVE VOTE ON THIS

01:35:54.949 --> 01:35:56.050
IMPORTANT MEASURE.

01:35:56.117 --> 01:35:58.319
IN ADDITION TO CLARIFYING THE

01:35:58.385 --> 01:36:00.221
SECTION ONE ISSUES THAT THE

01:36:00.287 --> 01:36:02.990
SENATOR JUST -- CAPABLE REFER --

01:36:03.057 --> 01:36:05.493
TO SECTION TO THE BILL IS VERY

01:36:05.559 --> 01:36:07.328
CRITICAL FOR OUR HOMEOWNER

01:36:07.394 --> 01:36:09.063
CONSTITUENTS BECAUSE WHERE A

01:36:09.130 --> 01:36:11.432
PARK IS DESTROYED BY FIRE IN THE

01:36:11.499 --> 01:36:13.033
RESIDENTS ARE BURNED OUT.

01:36:13.100 --> 01:36:16.470
THIS WOULD GIVE THEM -- A CHANCE.

01:36:16.537 --> 01:36:18.472
TO SORT OF REBUILD THEIR OWN

01:36:18.539 --> 01:36:20.508
LIVES AS THE PARK OWNER IS DOING

01:36:20.574 --> 01:36:22.643
AND DOING THAT ON SUBSTANTIALLY

01:36:22.710 --> 01:36:24.879
THE SAME RENTAL TERMS TO START

01:36:24.945 --> 01:36:25.546
THE TENDENCY I THINK IS

01:36:25.613 --> 01:36:26.480
IMPORTANT.

01:36:26.547 --> 01:36:27.515
SO THAT THEY HAVE THE SAME

01:36:27.581 --> 01:36:30.584
CHANCE THAT THE PARK OWNER HAS --

01:36:30.651 --> 01:36:32.153
AND THERE ARE WAYS THAT THE PARK

01:36:32.219 --> 01:36:33.888
COULD OBVIOUSLY -- RAISE RENTS

01:36:33.954 --> 01:36:35.089
IF THEY NEEDED TO ONCE THE

01:36:35.156 --> 01:36:36.857
INITIAL TENNESSEE AND SECTION

01:36:36.924 --> 01:36:39.293
OCCURS I THINK THE AMENDMENTS TO

01:36:39.360 --> 01:36:42.029
THE BILL HAVE NOW CAPABILITY --

01:36:42.096 --> 01:36:43.931
PROVIDED FOR THE ISSUES OF

01:36:43.998 --> 01:36:44.532
INCREASED COSTS FOR THE PARK

01:36:44.598 --> 01:36:45.533
OWNERS.

01:36:45.599 --> 01:36:47.067
THE THIRD SECTION IS REALLY

01:36:47.134 --> 01:36:48.869
CRITICAL FOR ME I'VE ALWAYS

01:36:48.936 --> 01:36:51.305
CALLED THIS THE BLACK HOLE OF

01:36:51.372 --> 01:36:52.806
THE MOBILE HOME RESIDENCY LAW --

01:36:52.873 --> 01:36:54.575
BECAUSE THIS SECTION TALKS ABOUT

01:36:54.642 --> 01:36:56.243
THE STANDARDS THE PARK OWNERS TO

01:36:56.310 --> 01:36:58.746
USE WHEN QUALIFYING PERSPECTIVE

01:36:58.812 --> 01:37:01.282
PURCHASERS AND IT REFERS TO THE

01:37:01.348 --> 01:37:02.917
FINANCIAL ABILITY TO PAY THE

01:37:02.983 --> 01:37:05.519
RENT OR CHARGES OF THE PARK.

01:37:05.586 --> 01:37:07.388
BUT THAT PHRASE HAS NEVER BEEN

01:37:07.454 --> 01:37:08.889
ADEQUATELY DEFINED.

01:37:08.956 --> 01:37:09.957
AND SO WHAT YOU'VE HAD IN THE

01:37:10.024 --> 01:37:12.159
INDUSTRY IN MY THIRTY FIVE YEARS

01:37:12.226 --> 01:37:13.928
OF EXPERIENCE IS THIS INCOME

01:37:13.994 --> 01:37:16.263
TEST THIS THREE TO ONE INCOME

01:37:16.330 --> 01:37:17.298
RATIO TEST.

01:37:17.364 --> 01:37:18.766
THAT A PARK OWNER WILL USE

01:37:18.832 --> 01:37:20.434
WITHOUT REALLY CONSIDERING ANY

01:37:20.501 --> 01:37:23.470
OTHER ASSETS -- MANY TIMES OF

01:37:23.537 --> 01:37:25.406
THE PROSPECTIVE PURCHASER.

01:37:25.472 --> 01:37:26.373
WHICH IS.

01:37:26.440 --> 01:37:27.675
OBVIOUSLY NOT THE WAY IT WOULD

01:37:27.741 --> 01:37:29.643
WORK IF SOMEBODY WAS APPLYING

01:37:29.710 --> 01:37:31.111
FOR A FOR A LOAN FOR EXAMPLE.

01:37:31.178 --> 01:37:33.514
SO ADDING THOSE SPECIFIC OTHER

01:37:33.581 --> 01:37:34.848
ASSET ISSUES THAT THE PARKER

01:37:34.915 --> 01:37:36.417
NEEDS TO LOOK AT IS REALLY

01:37:36.483 --> 01:37:38.819
CRITICAL -- ESPECIALLY IN SENIOR

01:37:38.886 --> 01:37:40.054
PARKS WHERE YOU HAVE MORE

01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:42.456
LIMITED -- CAPABILITY TO

01:37:42.523 --> 01:37:43.958
PURCHASE AND WE KNOW THAT.

01:37:44.024 --> 01:37:45.559
THE NUMBER OF MOBILE HOME

01:37:45.626 --> 01:37:50.064
LENDERS IN THE IN THE INDUSTRY

01:37:50.130 --> 01:37:50.831
IS DECREASING.

01:37:50.898 --> 01:37:51.999
SO THIS BILL WILL ENSURE THAT A

01:37:52.066 --> 01:37:52.833
PARK HONOR CANNOT REGION LEAD

01:37:52.900 --> 01:37:53.701
HERE TO A SELF CREATED INCOME

01:37:53.767 --> 01:37:55.803
RATIO ONLY THAT OTHER ASSETS

01:37:55.869 --> 01:37:58.305
WILL NEED TO BE CONSIDERED -- I

01:37:58.372 --> 01:38:00.407
ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE AND EXHORT

01:38:00.474 --> 01:38:03.043

01:38:03.110 --> 01:38:05.646

WITH THE NOTION OF OF THREE

01:42:32.045 --> 01:42:33.113
COMPANIONS DURING A CALENDAR

01:42:33.180 --> 01:42:34.915

WHEN YOU -- PASSED -- I GUESS SB

01:42:37.851 --> 01:42:38.418

ABOUT YOUR THINKING BEHIND THAT.

01:42:44.124 --> 01:42:46.126
DO YOU WANT.

01:42:46.193 --> 01:42:47.427
TO IT IS ESSENTIALLY WHAT WAS

01:42:47.494 --> 01:42:48.695
WHAT WAS HAPPENING IS IS.

01:42:48.762 --> 01:42:50.330
YOUR WILL WE DON'T HAVE VERY

01:42:50.397 --> 01:42:51.732
OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF

01:42:51.798 --> 01:42:53.600
FORMAL HOUSING SO IN MOBILE

01:42:53.667 --> 01:42:57.538
HOMES OFTEN THERE'S YELLOW. TO

01:42:57.604 --> 01:42:59.239
TWO ROOMS AND SOMETIMES THREE

01:42:59.306 --> 01:43:00.040
ROOMS.

01:43:00.107 --> 01:43:03.076
ADD -- YOU KNOW THE IDEA WAS IS.

01:43:03.143 --> 01:43:04.778
YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF

01:43:04.845 --> 01:43:06.146
SENIORS AT THE END OF THEIR LIFE.

01:43:06.213 --> 01:43:07.781
LIFESPAN WOULD THEY WANT

01:43:07.848 --> 01:43:09.416
COMPANIONSHIP THAT'S ONE THEY

01:43:09.483 --> 01:43:12.920
HAVE FRIENDS -- THAT -- PERHAPS --

01:43:12.986 --> 01:43:14.254
YELLED CAN'T AFFORD THE RENT

01:43:14.321 --> 01:43:15.556
ANYMORE WHERE THEY ARE SO IT

01:43:15.622 --> 01:43:17.558
JUST SEEMED LIKE A A NATURAL

01:43:17.624 --> 01:43:20.460
THAT THAT -- YEAH WOULD BE DONE

01:43:20.527 --> 01:43:21.395
AND THAT WAS IT THE ESSENCE OF

01:43:21.461 --> 01:43:23.030
THE BILL AND THEN THERE WAS SOME

01:43:23.096 --> 01:43:24.831
CONFUSION IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW

01:43:24.898 --> 01:43:27.234
HOW THAT WAS THIS KIND OF A

01:43:27.301 --> 01:43:27.634
CLEAN UP BILL.

01:43:27.701 --> 01:43:30.437
I DON'T RELEASED SPECIFICALLY --

01:43:30.504 --> 01:43:34.141
RECALL WHY THE NUMBER WAS --

01:43:34.207 --> 01:43:35.242
THREE TO BE TOTALLY HONEST WITH

01:43:35.309 --> 01:43:36.677
YOU I DON'T KNOW IF YOU DO I

01:43:36.743 --> 01:43:38.312
THINK IT'S JUST THAT IT'S A

01:43:38.378 --> 01:43:39.146
NUMBER THAT I THINK WOULD

01:43:39.212 --> 01:43:42.382
REPRESENT A REASONABLE UPPER

01:43:42.449 --> 01:43:43.684
LIMIT IN A TWELVE MONTH PERIOD.

01:43:43.750 --> 01:43:45.519
WHERE COMPANIONS ARE CHANGED OUT

01:43:45.586 --> 01:43:47.321
BY OTHER DEATH THEY'RE MOVING OR

01:43:47.387 --> 01:43:49.456
ANY OTHER CIRCUMSTANCE ARE

01:43:49.523 --> 01:43:51.558
OBVIOUS YOU SHOULD BE A LIMIT?

01:43:51.625 --> 01:43:53.060
BUT BEFORE PARK OWNERS WERE

01:43:53.126 --> 01:43:53.927
INTERPRETING IT IS SAYING YOU

01:43:53.994 --> 01:43:55.596
CAN ONLY NAME WINE AND IF THAT

01:43:55.662 --> 01:43:58.031
PERSON DIES OR LEAVES YOU CANNOT

01:43:58.098 --> 01:44:00.400
FILL THAT VACANCY UNTIL THE

01:44:00.467 --> 01:44:05.339
ENTIRE CALENDAR YEAR.

01:44:05.405 --> 01:44:06.640
ELAPSES.

01:44:06.707 --> 01:44:07.841
SO SO THE THE THE OTHER THING

01:44:07.908 --> 01:44:08.408
YOU WOULD WANT TO HAVE A LOT

01:44:08.475 --> 01:44:09.876
MORE THAN THAT BECAUSE THAT IT'S

01:44:09.943 --> 01:44:10.844
MORE OF A TRANSIT HOUSING OR YOU

01:44:10.911 --> 01:44:12.546
KNOW SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO.

01:44:12.613 --> 01:44:14.348
I I I I I APPRECIATE -- YOU

01:44:14.414 --> 01:44:16.683
BRING UP THE POINT THAT WAS

01:44:16.750 --> 01:44:17.651
EXACTLY IT.

01:44:17.718 --> 01:44:19.319
SO THIS IS THIS IS.

01:44:19.386 --> 01:44:21.722
NOT THREE PERSONS AT ONE TIME

01:44:21.788 --> 01:44:23.023
IT'S NOT LET'S JUST SAY THAT

01:44:23.090 --> 01:44:25.759
SOMEBODY YOU HAD A SENIOR SAYS

01:44:25.826 --> 01:44:26.627
THAT MOVED IN WITH SOMEBODY.

01:44:26.693 --> 01:44:28.061
THAT PERSON DIED.

01:44:28.128 --> 01:44:28.929
OR THAT PERSON HAD TO MOVE AND

01:44:28.996 --> 01:44:31.031
MOVE INTO A SKILLED NURSING

01:44:31.098 --> 01:44:32.699
FACILITY OR MOVE IN WITH A

01:44:32.766 --> 01:44:35.002
FAMILY MEMBER SO NOW THIS ROOM

01:44:35.068 --> 01:44:36.903
IS OPEN AGAIN.

01:44:36.970 --> 01:44:38.205
IT'S SO THAT THAT WOULD BE THE

01:44:38.271 --> 01:44:39.940
SAY THAT HAPPENS OF THREE MONTHS

01:44:40.007 --> 01:44:43.243
THAT WOULD BE NUMBER SOMEBODY

01:44:43.310 --> 01:44:44.911
ELSE CAME IN THERE THAT'S NUMBER.

01:44:44.978 --> 01:44:45.545
TWO SIX MONTHS LATER IT HAPPENS

01:44:45.612 --> 01:44:46.780
AGAIN -- THAT WOULD BE THE TH

01:44:46.847 --> 01:44:50.017
THE THIRD AND FINAL.

01:44:50.083 --> 01:44:51.718
ONE OKAY I I APPRECIATE THAT I

01:44:51.785 --> 01:44:52.819
MEAN I IF I'M GOING TO SUPPORT

01:44:52.886 --> 01:44:54.254
THIS BILL THAT I APPRECIATE WHAT

01:44:54.321 --> 01:44:55.856
YOU'RE TRYING TO DO I JUST --

01:44:55.922 --> 01:44:56.757
YOU KNOW THE ON SOME OF THESE

01:44:56.823 --> 01:44:57.357
ISSUES I THINK A LIGHTER TOUCH

01:44:57.424 --> 01:44:58.825
APPROACH FROM SACRAMENTO MIGHT

01:44:58.892 --> 01:44:59.893
BE THE BETTER WAY TO GO AND

01:44:59.960 --> 01:45:01.561
LETTING FOLKS ON THE GROUND WORK

01:45:01.628 --> 01:45:02.195
OUT SOME OF THESE DETAILS AMONG

01:45:02.262 --> 01:45:04.464
THEMSELVES -- SO APPRECIATE WHAT

01:45:04.531 --> 01:45:06.233
YOU'RE TRYING TO DO -- AND

01:45:06.299 --> 01:45:08.669
APPRECIATE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE

01:45:08.735 --> 01:45:10.704
AND I THINK MOST OF THE TIME.
