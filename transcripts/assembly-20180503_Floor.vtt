01:13:42.418 --> 01:13:45.454 region:rollup2
PASSED IN AN ERA OF FEAR.

01:13:43.986 --> 01:13:47.590 region:rollup2

ADDED TO THAT THERE WAS

01:14:01.737 --> 01:14:04.740 region:rollup2
WIDESPREAD PARANOIA THE LED MANY

01:14:03.339 --> 01:14:06.575 region:rollup2
IN THE U. S. TO BELIEVE THAT THE

01:14:04.740 --> 01:14:09.645 region:rollup2
CHINESE PEOPLE WERE HERE TO TAKE

01:14:06.575 --> 01:14:11.580 region:rollup2
OUR JOBS AND UNDERCUT OUR WAGES.

01:14:09.645 --> 01:14:13.349 region:rollup2
SOUNDS LIKE VERY SIMILAR

01:14:11.580 --> 01:14:14.617 region:rollup2
PARALLEL LANGUAGE OF TODAY.

01:14:13.349 --> 01:14:16.886 region:rollup2
THERE ARE MANY DISGRACEFUL

01:14:14.617 --> 01:14:18.621 region:rollup2

IMMIGRANTS OF ALL BACKGROUNDS

01:14:20.089 --> 01:14:22.825 region:rollup2

EXCLUDED FROM COMING TO THE

UNITED STATES SOLELY ON THE

01:14:40.976 --> 01:14:44.714 region:rollup2
BASIS OF THEIR ETHNICITY.

01:14:42.912 --> 01:14:46.549 region:rollup2
TRAGICALLY THIS BIGOTRY IS STILL

01:14:44.714 --> 01:14:47.850 region:rollup2
GOING ON TODAY.

01:14:46.549 --> 01:14:49.952 region:rollup2
WE DON'T NEED TO LOOK ANY

01:14:47.850 --> 01:14:52.054 region:rollup2
FURTHER THAN TODAY'S HEADLINES

01:14:49.952 --> 01:14:53.589 region:rollup2
REGARDING THE RESCINDING OF TPS

01:14:52.054 --> 01:14:55.224 region:rollup2
THE MISGUIDED CALLS FOR A

01:14:53.589 --> 01:14:57.560 region:rollup2

01:15:11.841 --> 01:15:15.077 region:rollup2
