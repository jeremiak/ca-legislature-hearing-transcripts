00:25:29.361 --> 00:25:30.929

APPROPRIATE IT THAT IN NO WAY

THE PAST FEW YEARS THE

00:36:43.568 --> 00:36:46.404
LEGISLATURE SCENE AND A LARGE-NUMBER OF BILLS WITH SICK ALL

00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:48.539
THE SUGGESTED. CHANGES TO THE

00:36:48.606 --> 00:36:50.241
LETTERMAN PETROUS SHORT ACT.

00:36:50.308 --> 00:36:51.976
WHILE WELL INTENDED THESE

00:36:52.043 --> 00:36:53.344
PROPOSALS TENDED TO ADDRESS

00:36:53.411 --> 00:36:55.446
SINGLE ACTS ASPECTS OF LPS

00:36:55.513 --> 00:36:57.548
RATHER THAN A- RATHER THAN AT A

00:36:57.615 --> 00:36:59.750
BROADER MORE SYSTEMIC. ISSUES OF

00:36:59.817 --> 00:37:01.752
A FIFTY FIVE YEAR OLD PROGRAM

00:37:01.819 --> 00:37:02.853
THAT TO MY KNOWLEDGE HAS NEVER

00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:05.423
HAD A FULL EVALUATION OR REPORT.

00:37:05.489 --> 00:37:06.591
THAT'S WHY LAST DECEMBER

00:37:06.657 --> 00:37:07.959
ASSEMBLY JUDICIARY AND HEALTH

00:37:08.025 --> 00:37:09.360
COMMITTEES CONDUCTED A JOINT

00:37:09.427 --> 00:37:11.395
HEARING ON THE L. P. S. ACT.

00:37:11.462 --> 00:37:12.563
AFTER NEARLY NINE HOURS OF

00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:13.898
TESTIMONY AND DISCUSSION IT WAS

00:37:13.965 --> 00:37:15.433
APPARENT THAT THE SYSTEM NEEDS

00:37:15.499 --> 00:37:17.702
ADDRESSING. MOST ALARMING WAS

00:37:17.768 --> 00:37:18.736
THE LACK OF CLARITY AND

00:37:18.803 --> 00:37:20.838
CONSISTENCY IN SOME BASIC BACK

00:37:20.905 --> 00:37:22.773
ASPECTS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF

00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:24.809
THE ACT. THESE INCONSISTENCIES

00:37:24.875 --> 00:37:26.277
RESULT IN PEOPLE BEING DETAINED

00:37:26.344 --> 00:37:28.713
ON FIFTY ONE FIFTY HOLDS TREATED

00:37:28.779 --> 00:37:30.314
DIFFERENTLY DEPENDING ON WHERE

00:37:30.381 --> 00:37:32.450
THEY RESIDE. WHERE THEY ARE HELD

00:37:32.516 --> 00:37:34.318
OR HOW THINGS ARE INTERPRETED.

00:37:34.385 --> 00:37:35.386
THE SECOND MOST ALARMING

00:37:35.453 --> 00:37:36.787
REVELATION WAS THE ALMOST

00:37:36.854 --> 00:37:38.956
COMPLETE LACK OF DATA EITHER

00:37:39.023 --> 00:37:41.292
REAL TIME OR HISTORICAL. HOW CAN

00:37:41.359 --> 00:37:42.460
A SYSTEM THAT IS DESIGNED TO

00:37:42.526 --> 00:37:43.728
PROTECT AND SERVE OUR MOST

00:37:43.794 --> 00:37:45.329
VULNERABLE POPULATION HAVE

00:37:45.396 --> 00:37:47.498
ABSOLUTELY NO DATA UPON WHICH TO

00:37:47.565 --> 00:37:49.266
ASSESS ITS EFFECTIVENESS. HOW

00:37:49.333 --> 00:37:50.668
CAN WE AS A LEGISLATURE BE

00:37:50.735 --> 00:37:52.336
CALLED UPON TO DO THE RIGHT

00:37:52.403 --> 00:37:56.073
THING ON BEHALF OF CITIZENS. WE

00:37:56.140 --> 00:37:56.841
DON'T KNOW WHAT WE DON'T KNOW.

00:37:56.907 --> 00:37:58.843
AB TWENTY TWO SEVENTY FIVE IS A

00:37:58.909 --> 00:37:59.844
RELATIVELY SIMPLE BILL AND

00:41:54.445 --> 00:41:56.113
M. IN PARTICULAR WE BELIEVE IT'S

00:41:56.180 --> 00:41:57.748
IMPORTANT TO BALANCE DUE PROCESS

RELATIONSHIP WE'VE HAD WITH OUR

00:46:46.336 --> 00:46:47.471
TWO COMMITTEES I THINK IT'S BEEN

00:46:47.538 --> 00:46:49.740
REALLY. ASTONISHING AND VERY

00:46:49.806 --> 00:46:51.408
HELPFUL WITH THE DIFFERENT

PERSPECTIVES FROM THE HEALTH

00:46:52.976 --> 00:46:55.212
SIDE AND THEN OF COURSE THE

00:46:55.279 --> 00:46:55.946
JUDICIARY SIDE WERE WERE.

00:46:56.013 --> 00:46:58.248
LOOKING OUT FOR THAT THE RIGHTS

00:46:58.315 --> 00:47:01.018
OF INDIVIDUAL PEOPLE AND I DO. I

00:47:01.084 --> 00:47:02.653
ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT THE CURRENT

00:47:02.719 --> 00:47:04.254
IMPETUS ACROSS THE BOARD FROM

00:47:04.321 --> 00:47:05.656
THE CARE COURTS ALL THESE OTHER

00:47:05.722 --> 00:47:06.690
PROPOSALS THAT ARE COMING

00:47:06.757 --> 00:47:08.592
THROUGH. AND YET THE HEARING

00:47:08.659 --> 00:47:09.726
THAT WE HAD WAS VERY LUMINATE

00:47:09.793 --> 00:47:11.461
HANG ON SOME OF THE CHALLENGES

00:47:11.528 --> 00:47:13.797
WITHIN THE EXISTING LPS SYSTEM.

00:47:13.864 --> 00:47:15.566
AND IS ORIGINALLY FRAME THE CARE

00:47:15.632 --> 00:47:17.734
CORPORATE PUZZLE BEING. PUT MORE

00:47:17.801 --> 00:47:19.603
OF A FRONTEND AND THE LPS SYSTEM

00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:21.138
BEING AS A BACKSTOP UNDERSCORED

00:47:21.205 --> 00:47:23.207
THE NEED TO HAVE THIS LEVEL OF

00:47:23.273 --> 00:47:25.442
INVESTIGATION I THINK RIGHT NOW

00:47:25.509 --> 00:47:27.277
WITH THE DISCUSSIONS. OF CARE

00:47:27.344 --> 00:47:28.745
ACCORDING ALL THESE BILLS.

00:47:28.812 --> 00:47:30.113
THERE'S A LOT OF CONFUSION OF

00:47:30.180 --> 00:47:31.682
LINES IN HERE WHICH MAKES ME A

00:47:31.748 --> 00:47:33.550
LITTLE BIT CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT

00:47:33.617 --> 00:47:34.751
WE'RE IMPOSING WHAT POTENTIALLY

00:47:34.818 --> 00:47:38.055
IMPOSING ON COUNTIES AND- WHAT

00:47:38.121 --> 00:47:40.257
WE'RE GOING TO SUBJECT PEOPLE TO

00:47:40.324 --> 00:47:41.858
AS THEY COME INTO THE SYSTEM SO

00:47:41.925 --> 00:47:43.927
THERE'S A LOT OF WORK THAT NEEDS

00:47:43.994 --> 00:47:45.529
TO BE DONE HOWEVER THIS WORK I

00:47:45.596 --> 00:47:46.830
DO BELIEVE IT'S ABSOLUTELY

00:47:46.897 --> 00:47:48.432
FOUNDATIONAL. TO GETTING NEXT

00:47:48.498 --> 00:47:50.467
STEPS DONE AND IT'S JUST BEEN

00:47:50.534 --> 00:47:51.368
SUCH A PLEASURE WORKING WITH

YOUR COMMITTEE AND YOUR

00:47:52.803 --> 00:47:56.073
EXPERTISE ON IN THIS AREA THAT

00:47:56.139 --> 00:47:57.841
WE CAN COLLABORATE AND PUT

00:47:57.908 --> 00:47:59.843
TOGETHER SOMETHING THAT. I HATE

00:47:59.910 --> 00:48:01.378
TO SAY ANYTHING IS A WORK IN

00:48:01.445 --> 00:48:02.980
PROGRESS THIS IS CERTAINLY

00:48:03.046 --> 00:48:05.148
WORTHY OF MOVING OUT OF THE THIS

00:48:05.215 --> 00:48:07.251
COMMITTEE AND MOVING FORWARD BUT

00:48:07.317 --> 00:48:09.753
YET THERE ARE QUESTIONS BEING

00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:10.487
RAISED THAT I THINK WE

00:48:10.554 --> 00:48:12.222
DEFINITELY NEED TO BE LOOKING AT

00:48:12.289 --> 00:48:14.157
AND TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION AS

00:48:14.224 --> 00:48:14.925
WE AS WE MOVE SOMETHING THROUGH

00:48:14.992 --> 00:48:18.061
SO I. VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE

00:48:18.128 --> 00:48:19.529
WORK ON HERE. OTHER QUESTIONS

00:48:19.596 --> 00:48:22.666
COMMENTS WAS REST. I DO%

00:48:22.733 --> 00:48:24.468

TWO THOUSAND BUT THE GUN

00:56:51.574 --> 00:56:52.909
INDUSTRY FOUGHT US FOR FIVE

00:56:52.976 --> 00:56:54.577

COURT RULE TO ALLOW THE CASE TO

00:57:00.784 --> 00:57:02.619
MOVE FORWARD. BUT LITTLE DID WE

00:57:02.685 --> 00:57:04.587
KNOW THAT CONGRESS HAD ALSO BEEN

00:57:04.654 --> 00:57:06.456
LOOKING AT FIREARM INDUSTRY

00:57:06.523 --> 00:57:08.758
LAWSUITS LIKE OURS. THAT SAME

00:57:08.825 --> 00:57:10.794
YEAR IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE

00:57:10.860 --> 00:57:12.228
CONGRESS PASSED THE PROTECTION

00:57:12.295 --> 00:57:14.697

OCCUR ON A SPECTRUM AS THERE ARE

02:15:29.754 --> 02:15:31.523
MANY DIFFERENT WAYS SOMEONE CAN

02:15:31.590 --> 02:15:33.325
EXPERIENCE THIS TYPE OF HARM.

02:15:33.391 --> 02:15:34.559
I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT MY

02:15:34.626 --> 02:15:36.561
EXPERIENCE AS A SURVIVOR AS WELL

02:15:36.628 --> 02:15:37.963
AS AN ADVOCATE AND PROGRAM

02:15:38.029 --> 02:15:39.064
SPECIALIST FOR PEOPLE

02:15:39.130 --> 02:15:40.332
EXPERIENCING ABUSE AND

02:15:40.398 --> 02:15:42.868
EXPLOITATION. IN THE EARLY DAYS

02:15:42.934 --> 02:15:44.769
OF MY VICTIMIZATION THE LABOR

02:15:44.836 --> 02:15:46.404
TRAFFICKING I WAS SUBJECTED TO

02:15:46.471 --> 02:15:48.573
ACTED AS A GATEWAY TO

02:15:48.640 --> 02:15:49.007
EXPERIENCING SEXUAL

02:15:49.074 --> 02:15:51.476
EXPLOITATION. I HAD TO STEAL

02:15:51.543 --> 02:15:53.178
FROM THE MALL. FIGHT OTHER

02:15:53.245 --> 02:15:56.915
PEOPLE COMMIT FRAUD. IT WAS EVEN

02:15:56.982 --> 02:15:58.783
COERCED INTO EXPLOITING OTHERS.

02:15:58.850 --> 02:15:59.885
AT THE TIME I THOUGHT MY

02:15:59.951 --> 02:16:01.653
BEHAVIORS WERE THE RESULT OF MY

02:16:01.720 --> 02:16:03.555
OWN CHOICES. BUT LOOKING BACK I

02:16:03.622 --> 02:16:05.123
REALIZE THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS

02:16:05.190 --> 02:16:06.525
AMOUNT OF MANIPULATION INVOLVED

02:16:06.591 --> 02:16:08.860
THAT RISES TO THE ELEMENTS OF

02:16:08.927 --> 02:16:11.396
FORCE FRAUD AND COERCION. IF MY

02:16:11.463 --> 02:16:12.697
EXPERIENCE WAS RECOGNIZED AS

02:16:12.764 --> 02:16:14.533
LABOR EXPLOITATION INSTEAD OF

02:16:14.599 --> 02:16:16.535
CRIMINALITY. I COULD HAVE BEEN

02:16:16.601 --> 02:16:17.769
CONNECTED TO THE SUPPORT OF

02:16:17.836 --> 02:16:19.204
SERVICES THAT I NEEDED. WHICH

02:16:19.271 --> 02:16:20.639
COULD HAVE HELPED ME AVOID

02:16:20.705 --> 02:16:23.041
SEXUAL EXPLOITATION. I WISH I

02:16:23.108 --> 02:16:24.809
COULD HAVE BEEN CONNECTED TO

02:16:24.876 --> 02:16:26.111
OPPORTUNITIES FOR JOB TRAINING

02:16:26.177 --> 02:16:27.312

02:16:27.379 --> 02:16:30.882
GROWTH AND HEALING. INSTEAD OF

02:16:30.949 --> 02:16:33.618
CRIMINALIZING SENT TO PRISON.

02:16:33.685 --> 02:16:35.487
OUT SIDE OF MY OWN EXPERIENCE

02:16:35.554 --> 02:16:37.022
I'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK

02:16:37.088 --> 02:16:38.990
WITH YOUTH EXPERIENCING ABUSE

02:16:39.057 --> 02:16:40.959
AND EXPLOITATION. HOWEVER

02:16:41.026 --> 02:16:42.127
BECAUSE OF THE STATE'S OVER

02:16:42.193 --> 02:16:43.762
EMPHASIS ON COMMERCIALLY

02:16:43.828 --> 02:16:45.630

OFTEN YOU ARE MISIDENTIFIED AND

02:16:49.067 --> 02:16:50.068
NOT CONNECTED TO THE SERVICES

THEY NEED. YOUTH WHO ARE BEING

02:17:05.450 --> 02:17:07.018
BRINGS UP EMPTY SECULAR

02:17:07.085 --> 02:17:08.720
ARGUMENTS THAT THERE'S NO DATA

02:17:08.787 --> 02:17:11.089
TO SUPPORT THIS BILL. HOWEVER

02:17:11.156 --> 02:17:12.924
THERE IS NO DATA TO NOT SUPPORT

02:17:12.991 --> 02:17:14.759
THIS BILL BECAUSE CALIFORNIA HAS

02:17:14.826 --> 02:17:16.661
NOT BEEN MANDATED OR

02:17:16.728 --> 02:17:18.630
INCENTIVIZED TO COLLECT ANY.

02:17:18.697 --> 02:17:20.265
CALIFORNIA HAS FAILED SURVIVORS

02:17:20.332 --> 02:17:22.267
AND EXPLOITED YOUTH BY FAILING

02:17:22.334 --> 02:17:23.902
TO CORRECT THIS OVERSIGHT AND

02:17:23.969 --> 02:17:25.670
THE CONSEQUENCES ARE DEVASTATING

02:17:25.737 --> 02:17:28.006
FOR ALL STAKEHOLDERS. SURVIVORS

02:17:28.073 --> 02:17:29.074

LOOPHOLES THAT WE- HAVE SEEN

02:59:25.154 --> 02:59:27.456
HAPPEN WHICH WE BELIEVE GO

02:59:27.523 --> 02:59:28.691

TERMINATE THE LEASE OF TENANTS

02:59:42.037 --> 02:59:43.372
WHO ARE ABIDING BY THE RULES IN

NO FAULT CAUSES WERE AGREED TO

03:00:07.530 --> 03:00:09.165
IS REASONABLE WHAT WE'VE SEEN ON

03:00:09.231 --> 03:00:10.733
THE GROUND IS THAT SOME PROPERTY

03:00:10.799 --> 03:00:12.568
