MS FRIEDMAN YOU MAY OPEN. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE TODAY TO PRESENT HR ONE A ONE THE DENIM DAY SEXUAL ASSAULT AWARENESS MONTH RESOLUTION. WE ALL RECOGNIZE DENIM DAY AS THE ONE DAY EACH YEAR WE GET TO BUST OUT OF OUR BLAZERS AND TIES. AND ROCK OUR FAVORITE PAIR OF JEANS BUT DEBT OF DAY REPRESENTS SO MUCH MORE THAN SUPPORTING OUR OFFICIAL STATE FABRIC WHILE ON THE JOB. IT'S ROOT CAUSES MUCH MORE SERIOUS AND MUCH MORE TROUBLING. TWENTY YEARS AGO THE ITALIAN SUPREME COURT REVERSED THE CONVICTION OF A MAN WHO RAPED AN EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD WOMAN. THE COURT DETERMINED THAT THE ATTACK MOST OF THE CONSENSUAL BECAUSE THE WOMAN WAS WEARING JEANS THAT WERE SO TIGHT THAT THE ONLY WAY TO REMOVE THEM WOULD BE WITH HER HELP. RATHER THAN BELIEVE THAT HER FORTY FIVE YEAR OLD DRIVING INSTRUCTOR. I TAKE HER TO AN ISOLATED ROAD REMOVE HER FROM THE CAR WRESTLE HER OUT OF HER JEANS AND RAPED HER. THE CHIEF JUSTICE EXCUSE THE MAN'S BEHAVIOR BY STATING QUOTE. BECAUSE THE VICTIM WERE VERY VERY TIGHT JEANS SHE HAD TO HELP HIM REMOVE THEM AND BY REMOVING THE JEANS IT WAS NO LONGER RAPE. BUT CONSENSUAL SEX. RIGHTFULLY ENRAGED BY THE CORD WOMEN OF THE ITALIAN PARLIAMENT SHOWED UP FOR WORK WEARING JEANS TO PROTEST THIS. SERB RULING. THE FACT THAT WE STILL HAVE A PROBLEM WITH SEXUAL VIOLENCE IN THIS COUNTRY DEMONSTRATE FOR THIS TYPE OF RESOLUTION IS STILL. SO IMPORTANT TWENTY YEARS LATER. I RECENTLY RECEIVED A LETTER FROM ONE OF MY CONSTITUENTS WHO RECOUNTED HER EXPERIENCE OF BEING SEXUALLY ASSAULTED. SHE USED THOSE EXPERIENCE TO FUEL HER OWN PASSION. AND HER DESIRE TO HELP OTHER PEOPLE SPEAK WITH THEIR OWN VOICES. SHE WROTE TO ME. ONCE MY VOICE WAS FOUND I WANTED EVERYONE TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SEE. AS LEADERS IN THE STATE WE ARE IN A UNIQUE POSITION TO SPEAK OUT FOR THOSE WHO CANNOT SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES. WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO RAISE OUR VOICES TO LIFT THE STIGMA THAT SURROUNDS SEXUAL VIOLENCE. SO THAT OTHERS CAN FEEL COMFORTABLE ALSO RAISING THEIR VOICES. IT'S INCUMBENT ON ALL OF US MEN AND WOMEN TO BRING ATTENTION TO THIS VERY SERIOUS ISSUE BECAUSE THIS IS NOT JUST A WOMEN'S ISSUE. SEXUAL VIOLENCE AFFECTS EVERY CALIFORNIAN REGARDLESS OF GENDER AGE RACE CLASS RELIGION OR SEXUAL ORIENTATION. ONE IN EVERY THREE WOMEN AND ONE IN EVERY SIX MEN WILL EXPERIENCE SOME FORM OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE IN THEIR LIFETIME. I WILL ALSO SAY THAT TO ARE MALE ALLIES THAT BEING THAT ALL I WHO RAISES YOUR VOICE. WHO DOESN'T STAND IDLY BY WHEN YOU SEE EXPRESSIONS OF? OF. WOMEN BEING ASSAULTED WHEN YOU WHEN YOU HEAR MEN DEMEAN WOMEN. DISREGARD WOMEN. SPEAK UP IN THAT MOMENT BECAUSE IT'S THOSE ATTITUDES THAT LEADS TO THE FEELING THAT MEN CAN TREAT WOMEN AS OBJECTS AND ASSAULT THEM. I'M VERY PROUD AUTHORED THIS YEAR'S DENIM DAY RESOLUTION. AND ASK THE FIRST ROLE BE OPEN FOR CO AUTHORS THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS. THEY CAME IS FRIEDMAN. MISS MELINDA S. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. I AM PROUD TO STAND TODAY IN SUPPORT OF HR ONE ó ONE TO DESIGNATE APRIL A SEXUAL ASSAULT AWARENESS MONTH. WE DON'T KNOW SOMEONE WHO HAS SUFFERED THE TRAUMA OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. SOME OF US IN THIS ROOM MAYBE VICTIMS. AND IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT HEALS OVERNIGHT IT TAKES TIME IT LEAVES A DEEP WOUND AN ONGOING PAIN FOR THE VICTIMS AND THEIR FAMILIES. BUT I AM PROUD TO SAY THAT WE HAVE INVESTED IN THE NECESSARY TECHNOLOGY TO HELP LAW ENFORCEMENT FIND THE CULPRITS OF THESE CRIMES. AND HAVE PROVIDED HEALTH AND COUNSELING SERVICES FOR HER RESOURCES FOR THE SURVIVORS. MORE RECENTLY WE ENSURE THAT OUR LEGISLATIVE STAFF HAVE WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTIONS TO REPORT SEXUAL ASSAULT IN THIS BUILDING. AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO MORE TO PROTECT THE INNOCENT AND TO ROOT OUT THOSE WHO PREY UPON THEM. WINSTON CHURCHILL ONCE SAID WE SHOWED DROP FROM THE HEART OF SUFFERING ITSELF THE MEANS OF INSPIRATION AND SURVIVAL. I HEARD YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS MELINDA'S MISS RUBIO YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. GOOD MORNING MR PICKED SPEAKER AND MEMBERS OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE CHAIR ON THE METHOD VIOLENCE I STAND IN STRONG SUPPORT OF HR ONE ONE. AN ESTIMATED FIVE POINT SEVEN MILLION CALIFORNIA WOMEN AND MEN EXPERIENCE INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE EACH YEAR. IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE AN ESTIMATED NINE HUNDRED AND FORTY EIGHT THOUSAND CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS. WHERE THE VICTIMS OF SOME FORM OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE? AND WHEN FACTORING THAT SOME VICTIMS WERE ASSAULTED REPEATEDLY DURING THAT YEAR BUT TOTAL INCIDENTS OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE IN THE STATE EXCEEDS ONE POINT ONE MILLION. A TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN REPORT FOUND THAT THE TANGIBLE COST OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE IN CALIFORNIA. INCLUDING MEDICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH CARE PREVENTION INVESTIGATION SANCTIONING TREATMENT AND VICTIM SERVICES TOTAL OVER AT NINE BILLION DOLLARS. H. ARE ONE ONE DESIGNATES THE MONTHLY PRO TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN A SEXUAL ASSAULT AWARENESS MONTH AND RECOGNIZES APRIL TWENTY FIFTH. AS THEM DAY IN CALIFORNIA.

WHICH RECOGNIZES APRIL TWENTY FIFTH TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AS DENIM DAY IN CALIFORNIA AND ENCOURAGES EVERYONE TO WEAR JEANS ON THAT DAY TO HELP COMMUNICATE. THE MESSAGE THAT THERE'S NO EXCUSE FOR AND NEVER IN INVITATION TO COMMIT RAPE. I THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM GLENDALE. FOR EMPHASIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF INCREASING AWARENESS BECAUSE IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO SUPPORT ALL RAPE SURVIVORS BY TREATING THEM WITH DIGNITY COMPASSION AND RESPECT. WE MUST RECOGNIZE A STRAIN THE COURAGE. CHALLENGES OF THE VICTIMS AND SURVIVORS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. AND THEIR FAMILIES AND FRIENDS AS THEY STRUGGLE TO COPE WITH THE REALITY OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. THERE IS NEVER AN INVITATION FOR RAPE. WE CONDEMN THE ACTIONS OF THE ITALIAN SUPREME COURT WHICH IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT OVERTURNED THE CONVICTION OF THE RAPIST. AS DESCRIBED BY MY COLLEAGUE. JUST AS THE WOMEN IN THE PARLIAMENT LAUNCHED INTO IMMEDIATE ACTION A PROTESTED BY WEARING JEANS TO WORK. WE ALSO JOINED IN SOLIDARITY. YESTERDAY BY WEARING JEANS. BY DOING SO WE PROTEST AGAINST THE MISCONCEPTIONS THAT SURROUND SEXUAL ASSAULT. AND HARMFUL ATTITUDES ABOUT RAPE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT THAT ALLOW THESE CRIMES TO PERSIST AND ALLOW SURVIVORS TO BE RE VICTIMIZED THROUGH VICTIM BLAMING ATTITUDES AND UNRESPONSIVE. GOVERNMENT SYSTEMS. WE MUST NOT ALLOW THIS CULTURE TO EXIST AND INSTEAD WE MUST CHALLENGE A SOCIETAL MYTHS AND BEHAVIORS BUT BUT THAT PERPETUATE RAPE. AND TO ENGAGE COMMUNITIES IN A COMMON GOAL OF ENDING SEXUAL ASSAULT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MS REYES. SEEING NO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THE ITEM. MISS FRIEDMAN YOU MAY CLOSE IF YOU WISH. THANK YOU ALL JUST ADD THAT. EACH AND EVERY DAY WE ALL NEED TO. CONSTANTLY CHALLENGING REEVALUATE THE SOCIETAL NORMS THAT LEAD TO. FEELINGS THAT ABOUT WHO IS POWERFUL AND WHO IS WEAK ABOUT WHAT MASCULINITY MEANS WHAT FAMILY MEANS AND WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A MAN. AND PUSHED BACK ON THE ATTITUDES THAT. TELL YOUNG MEN SOMETIMES THAT. IT THAT. BEING MASCULINE MEANS TO CONQUER TO CONQUER WOMEN. AND THAT IF WOMEN DON'T. CHAU DON'T ACQUIESCE TO THEM THAT THEY ARE THERE TO BE CONQUERED IN THOSE ATTITUDES START VERY EARLY IN VERY YOUNG AND WE ALL NEED TO PUSH BACK ON THOSE. IMAGES THAT ARE SHOWN IN OUR SOCIETY TO YOUNG PEOPLE AND OLDER PEOPLE AND SAY NO THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE AND THAT'S NOT WHAT IT IS TO BE A MAN IN OUR SOCIETY AND THAT'S NOT WHAT IT IS TO BE A WOMAN. ONLY BY CHANGING THEIR CULTURAL WE EVER REALLY AND SEXUAL ASSAULT AND WITH THAT I WOULD ASK FOR CO AUTHORS AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER SPEAKER. THANK YOU MS FRIEDMAN THE AUTHORS ASKING THAT THE FIRST WILL BE OPEN FOR CO AUTHORS ON THE RICH HOUSE RESOLUTION THE CLERK WILL OPEN THE ROLL-ON MEMBERS THIS IS FOR CO AUTHORS ON HR ONE ON ONE THIS. CO AUTHORS. CO AUTHORS ON HR ONE A ONE. CLERK. WILL CLOSE THE ROLE THERE ARE SEVENTY THREE CO AUTHORS ADDED. WE MAY TAKE A VOICE VOTE ON THIS HOUSE RESOLUTION ALL THOSE IN FAVOR SAY AYE. AYE OPPOSED SAY NAY. THE AYES HAVE IT THE RESOLUTION. IS ADOPTED. MEMBERS IN FILE ORDER WE ARE AT FILE ITEM NUMBER ONE TWENTY TWO THIS IS AB THIRTY ONE EIGHTY NINE BY MISTER COOPER THE CLERK WILL READ. ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTY ONE EIGHTY NINE BY SOME A MEMBER COOPER AND ACTUALLY TO MINORS MISTER COOPER. BUT MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS AB THIRTY ONE EIGHTY NINE ALLOWS A MINOR WHO'S THE VICTIM OF INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE. TO CONSENT TO MEDICAL TREATMENT WITHOUT PARENTAL CONSENT. MANY MINERS IN FEAR THEIR PARENTS OR GUARDIANS FINDING OUT ABOUT ABUSE MAY NOT SEEK TREATMENT FOR ABUSE FROM A PARTNER. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE REPORTS AVERAGE ABOUT FIVE REPORTS PER WEEK IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN WE'VE SEEN OVER FIFTEEN HUNDRED CASES. THIS BILL ELIMINATES ADDITIONAL LAYER OF COMPLICATION FOR VICTIMS OF INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE IN MAKES IT EASIER FOR MINORS WHO'VE BEEN ABUSED TO SEEK HELP. THIS BILL RECEIVED BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. AND NO NO VOTES ARE STEFFI ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THINGS COOPER MS BAKER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I'D DO YOU HAVE A QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR. WITHOUT OBJECTION THANK YOU I KNOW WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS JUST AS A POINT OF CLARIFICATION AND THAT IS TO UNDERSTAND MORE CLEARLY THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH A PARENT WILL BE NOTIFIED. OF THE IT'S MEANT DOMESTIC. PARDON THE INTIMATE PARTNER ABUSE I KNOW THERE'S A DEFINITION THAT YOUR BILL REFERENCES IT'S IN ANOTHER CODE SECTION. AND THAT THE BILL INTRO ALSO SUMMARIZES THAT IF THE PHYSICIAN WELL FIRST I ASK THAT QUESTION. IF YOU CAN CLARIFY PLEASE PLEASE UNDER WHICH CIRCUMSTANCES PARENTS WILL STILL BE NOTIFIED THAT THEIR MINOR CHILD HAS VISITED A DOCTOR ABOUT INTIMATE PARTNER ABUSE. THE BE NOTIFIED AFTER THE FACT AS LONG AS THE PARENT IS NOT THE ABUSER. GOD I THINK YOU KNOW MY OWN TIME IF I MAY. AND I APPRECIATE THAT BECAUSE THE IT AND ACTUALLY AND AS WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT I JUST WANNA SO I MORE REALIZE THAT THERE ARE STILL SOME QUESTIONS THAT WE'VE HAD TOGETHER. TO DETERMINE THAT THE PARENTS WILL BE NOTIFIED NOT ONLY NOT JUST IF IT'S SUSPECTED CHILD ABUSE. THERE'S CHILD ABUSE WHICH HAS DEFINITIONS AND THEN THERE'S THE DEFINITION YOU HAVE IN YOUR BILL OF INTIMATE PARTNER ABUSE AND WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S CLEAR THAT IF. A DAUGHTER OF A PARENT IS BEING ABUSED BY. A MINOR DOMESTIC. OR A MINOR PARTNER THAT SHE MAY HAVE THAT THE PARENTS STILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO FIND OUT SO THAT THEY CAN TAKE. APPROPRIATE ACTION WITHOUT ALSO REALIZING THAT IF THE MINOR WITH THE MINERS CONSENT. IF THE MINOR IS. ABUSED AND FEELS THAT THE PARENTS ARE GOING TO HAVE A REACTION THAT WILL KEEP THE MINOR FROM GOING TO THE DOCTOR WE DON'T WANT THAT. BUT MY READ OF YOUR BILL JUST THE TEXT OF THE BILL IS THAT IT. ONLY ALLOWS THE PARENTS TO BE NOTIFIED IF THE PHYSICIAN SUSPECTS CHILD ABUSE. AND I THINK AS THE BILL GOES OVER TO THE SENATE WHICH I HOPE WILL DO TODAY WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY IT'S GONNA BE REALLY IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE WE GET CLEAR ON THAT. BECAUSE THEY DO SEE A POTENTIAL INCONSISTENCY IN THE LANGUAGE AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. PARENTAL NOTIFICATION IF THE PARENTS IS NOT THE ABUSER. I CAN STILL HAPPEN AND AND THE PARENTS CAN STILL THEN TAKE ACTION TO PROTECT THEIR CHILDREN FROM THAT RELATIONSHIP. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MS BAKER MS MELENDEZ YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. COLLEAGUES THIS IS BAD PUBLIC POLICY. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO THE AUTHOR WHO ENJOY WORKING WITH AND I HAVE A GREAT RESPECT FOR BECAUSE OF HIS CAREER IN LAW ENFORCEMENT. THE AUTHOR STATEMENT SAYS THAT THIS BILL WILL REMOVE THE BARRIERS FOR MINERS WHO HAVE BEEN ASSAULTED. IT SHOULD FURTHER GO ON TO SAY IT REMOVES THE PARENTS. FROM THEIR RESPONSIBILITY WITH THEIR CHILD. IMAGINE IF YOU HAVE A CHILD LET'S SAY THERE'S A CHILD A GIRL YOUNG GIRL SHE'S THIRTEEN FOURTEEN WHATEVER. SHE HAS A BOYFRIEND. AND THE PARENTS DON'T LIKE HIM. AND THEY TOLD HER NOT TO SEE HIM. SHE DOES ANYWAY AS TEENAGERS DO. AND THEN SHE'S ASSAULTED. THEN SHE FEELS LIKE SHE CAN'T GO TELL HER PARENTS BECAUSE HE'S GOING TO GET MORE TROUBLE. BECAUSE SHE WASN'T SUPPOSED TO SEE HIM ANYWAY AND OH BY THE WAY OUR PARENTS DIDN'T LIKE HIM IN THE FIRST PLACE. SO WITH THAT THE POINT IN TIME WHERE WE'RE GOING TO REMOVE THE PARENTS FROM THE EQUATION REMOVE THEM FROM THEIR CHILD'S LIFE AT A TIME WHEN THAT CHILD IS GOING TO NEED HER MOTHER OR FATHER AT THE MOST. THAT IS VERY THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT STEP IN THIS PROCESS OF HEALING FOR A CHILD WHO HAS BEEN ASSAULTED. THEY'RE YOUNG THEY ARE VULNERABLE THEY'RE NOT MATURE ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND ALL OF THE THOUGHTS THEY'RE HAVING A WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THEM AND THE LAST THING I THINK WE WANT TO DO. IS TO TELL THEM. GO TO STRANGERS IN THE MEDICAL PROFESSION AND HAVE THEM HELP YOU AND LATER ON AFTER THE FACT. THEN YOU CAN YOU MAY TELL THE PARENTS. EVERY GOING TO ALLOW THE PARENTS TO BE NOTIFIED. WHY DOES IT HAVE TO BE AFTER THE FACT? WHY WOULDN'T IT BE BEFORE WHY ARE WE REMOVING PARENTS? FROM THEIR CHILD'S LIVES. THIS IS UNCONSCIONABLE AND I UNDERSTAND I'M SURE THAT THAT THE MOTIVE IS GENUINE AND SINCERE. BUT I THINK THIS IS BAD PUBLIC POLICY AND I THINK WE OUGHT NOT BE INTERVENING AND SEPARATING PARENTS FROM THEIR CHILDREN AT A TIME WHEN THAT CHILD PROBABLY NEEDS THEIR PARENTS THE MOST THEY'VE. EVER IN THEIR LIVES PLEASE VOTE NOW THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS MELENDEZ. SEEING NO OTHER MEMBERS SEEKING RECOGNITION. ON THE ITEM. MISTER COOPER YOU MAY CLOSE THAT MISTER SPEAKER.
