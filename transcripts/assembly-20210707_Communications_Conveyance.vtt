ADEQUATE AND RELIABLE BROADBAND

00:33:03.648 --> 00:33:05.583

00:33:08.453 --> 00:33:09.954
IS CRITICAL AND THIS PROPOSAL

00:33:10.021 --> 00:33:11.856
REMOVES THAT BARRIER FOR BOTH

00:33:11.923 --> 00:33:12.657

REVIEW STANDARDS WHAT A CITY BE

01:07:25.474 --> 01:07:26.342

JUST KNOW THAT THESE ARE ALWAYS.

01:13:03.045 --> 01:13:05.280
FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND

COMMUNITIES TOUGH. ISSUES TO

01:13:08.350 --> 01:13:09.918
KIND OF RECONCILE BECAUSE ON

01:13:09.985 --> 01:13:11.854
THE ONE HAND YOU'RE CREATING

01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:16.024
GREATER ACCESS- AND- EXPANDING

01:13:16.091 --> 01:13:18.360
BROADBAND WHICH AFTER LAST YEAR

01:13:18.427 --> 01:13:20.562
OBVIOUSLY WE'RE UNDERSTANDING

01:13:20.629 --> 01:13:21.997
HOW IMPORTANT IT IS FOR SOME

01:13:22.064 --> 01:13:23.866
COMMUNITIES ARE GETTING. VERY

01:13:23.932 --> 01:13:27.636
GOOD- BROADBAND TO HAVE GREATER

01:13:27.703 --> 01:13:29.705
ACCESS TO THE INTERNET. ON THE

01:13:29.772 --> 01:13:31.306
OTHER HAND YOU HAVE COMMUNITIES

01:13:31.373 --> 01:13:32.908
THAT ARE ALSO AND I'M LOOKING

01:13:32.975 --> 01:13:35.344
AT LOCAL CONTROL AND WANTED TO

01:13:35.410 --> 01:13:37.713
MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE NOT-

01:13:37.780 --> 01:13:39.848
TURNING AWAY ANY OPPORTUNITY TO

01:13:39.915 --> 01:13:42.117
MAKE SURE THERE'S A- A

01:13:42.184 --> 01:13:42.885
REASONABLE OPPORTUNITY

01:13:42.951 --> 01:13:46.822
INFLUENCE. HOW THESE- PROVIDERS

01:13:46.889 --> 01:13:47.823
INTERACT WITH THE COMMUNITY IN

01:13:47.890 --> 01:13:50.626
THE POLLS ARE TO GO UP SO I

01:13:50.692 --> 01:13:52.661
THINK THAT THE SENATOR HAS

01:13:52.728 --> 01:13:54.663
BASICALLY CODIFIED AS- BEEN

01:13:54.730 --> 01:13:59.201
SAID. FEDERAL LAW THAT NOW IS-

01:13:59.268 --> 01:14:01.336
COVERING THIS ISSUE FOR

01:14:01.403 --> 01:14:03.939
CALIFORNIA I THINK IT'S- A FAIR

01:14:04.006 --> 01:14:05.941
APPROACH THE ADDITIONAL.

01:14:06.008 --> 01:14:09.378
AMENDMENTS SEEM TO MAKE- MAKES

01:14:09.444 --> 01:14:12.347
SENSE BECAUSE THERE CAN GET TO

01:14:12.414 --> 01:14:15.284
A PLACE WHERE- AGAIN I DON'T

01:14:15.350 --> 01:14:16.618
THINK IT HAPPENS TOO OFTEN BUT

01:14:16.685 --> 01:14:18.487
IF THERE'S AN IMPASSE HOW DO

01:14:18.554 --> 01:14:20.422
YOU RESOLVE THAT AND IN A WAY

01:14:20.489 --> 01:14:23.025
THAT ALLOWS THE SERVICE TO GO

01:14:23.091 --> 01:14:26.128
FORWARD BECAUSE IT'S DESIGNED

01:14:26.195 --> 01:14:28.230
TO BENEFIT THE GOOD. OF A

01:14:28.297 --> 01:14:31.266
LARGER NUMBER OF FOLKS AND SO I

01:14:31.333 --> 01:14:33.669
THINK THAT THIS IS A REASONABLE

01:14:33.735 --> 01:14:36.305
APPROACH- THAT I THINK THAT

01:14:36.371 --> 01:14:38.640
THIS IS WORTH SUPPORTING I

01:14:38.707 --> 01:14:40.876
APPRECIATE OBVIOUSLY THE- THE

01:14:40.943 --> 01:14:42.244
NARROW FOCUS THAT THIS

BE DEPLOYED A ZERO EMISSION

01:54:09.709 --> 01:54:11.044
VEHICLES. THERE'S AN EXPERT

01:54:11.110 --> 01:54:12.212
CONSENSUS THAT ELECTRIFYING

01:54:12.278 --> 01:54:13.580
EV'S IS ONE OF THE ESSENTIAL

01:54:13.646 --> 01:54:15.281
COMPONENTS TO ENSURING THAT

01:54:15.348 --> 01:54:16.583
THERE ARE SUSTAINABLE PART OF

01:54:16.649 --> 01:54:18.484
OUR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM. FOR

01:54:18.551 --> 01:54:20.119
EXAMPLE RESEARCH FROM UC DAVIS

01:54:20.186 --> 01:54:21.621
FOUND THAT PERSONALLY OWNED AB

01:54:21.688 --> 01:54:22.722
IS UNLIKELY TO SIGNIFICANTLY

01:54:22.789 --> 01:54:24.257
INCREASE VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED

01:54:24.324 --> 01:54:25.325
WITH A LARGE PORTION OF THOSE

01:54:25.391 --> 01:54:26.659
MILD COMING WINDOW PASSENGERS

01:54:26.726 --> 01:54:28.628
IN THE VEHICLE. AND THE EV'S

01:54:28.695 --> 01:54:29.929
ARE LIKELY TO SHIFT PEOPLE AWAY

01:54:29.996 --> 01:54:31.798
FROM LOWER EMISSION MODE. IF

01:54:31.864 --> 01:54:33.099
YES RESEARCH FOUND THE

01:54:33.166 --> 01:54:34.400
POTENTIAL FOR AB TO INCREASE

01:54:34.467 --> 01:54:35.735
EMISSIONS AND AIR POLLUTION

01:54:35.802 --> 01:54:37.770
EVEN IN A SCENARIO WHERE

01:54:37.837 --> 01:54:38.638
POLICIES ENCOURAGE COOLING IN

01:54:38.705 --> 01:54:40.473
TRANSIT. OUR RESEARCH ALSO

01:54:40.540 --> 01:54:42.041
FOUND THAT NEGATIVE IMPACTS

01:54:42.108 --> 01:54:43.142
