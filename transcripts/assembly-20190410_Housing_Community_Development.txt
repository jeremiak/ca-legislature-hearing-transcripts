WEDNESDAY APRIL TENTH TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN MEETING OF THE ASSEMBLY HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE. OBVIOUS IT THIS TIME WE DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH MEMBERS PRESENT TO ESTABLISH A QUORUM SOME GONNA ASK FOR ALL MEMBERS OF OUR COMMITTEE IF YOU COULD PLEASE JOIN US IN ROOM ONE TWENTY SIX BUT GIVEN HOW MANY ITEMS WE HAVE AND HOW MANY MEMBERS ARE RUNNING AROUND TO DIFFERENT. COMMITTEES I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN IN THE ABSENCE OF A QUORUM AS A SUBCOMMITTEE AND WITH THAT MR BLOOM IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO JOIN US AT THE DÃ­AS. I KNOW YOU HAVE TO ITEMS -- LINE ITEM SEVEN AND EIGHT WOULD YOU LIKE TO TAKE LINE ITEM SEVEN FIRST. WHICH IS -- TWELVE SEVENTY NINE GOT IT IT'S UP TO YOU WHICHEVER ONE YOU WANT TO DO BUT THAT'S THE FIRST IN OUR SEVENTY NINE IN MY HAND TO THE TWELVE SEVENTY NINE FILE ITEM. SEVEN SO THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR REMOVING LAND USE BARRIERS TO EQUITABLE AND INCLUSIVE DEVELOPMENT AND HIGH RESOURCE AREAS OF THE STATE. PLACES WITH GOOD SCHOOLS JOBS ETCETERA IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF ADDRESSING CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING CRISIS AND INCREASING CHOICE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES. MANY OF THE PLACES WITH THE MOST X. A X.. MOST EXISTING RESOURCES AND AMENITIES REMAIN INACCESSIBLE TO LOW INCOME PEOPLE AND PEOPLE OF COLOR. AND THESE OF THE LACK OF DENSE MULTI FAMILY HOUSING IS ONE OF THE MANY BARRIERS THAT IMPEDE THIS ACCESS. HI RESOURCE AREAS MAY OR MAY NOT BE NEAR EXISTING HIGH QUALITY TRANSIT BUT THEY CAN SUPPORT GREEN INFILL DEVELOPMENT WHICH IS CRUCIAL TO SUPPORTING FUTURE TRANSIT EXPANSION. IF WE ARE SERIOUS ABOUT ADDRESSING THE STATE'S HOUSING NEEDS IN REDUCING AUTO DEPENDENCE THEN WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO INCREASE DENSITY AND EXPAND INFILL DEVELOPMENT IN MORE. PARTS OF THE STATE. AB TWELVE SEVENTY NINE WOULD USE DATA AND MAPPING TO IDENTIFY HIGH RESOURCE AREAS WHERE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT IS PREDOMINANTLY LOW DENSITY AND IT WOULD SCREEN OUT PLACES THERE ARE HIGH THAT ARE AT HIGH RISK. FOR GENTRIFICATION AND DISPLACEMENT THE REMAINING AREAS AREAS WHERE THERE ARE STRONG INDICATORS OF EXCLUSIONARY LAND USE PATTERNS WOULD BE SUBJECT IS OWNING OVER RIGHTS TO ENCOURAGE THE PRODUCTION. OF DANCE SMALL SCALE MARKET RATE HOUSING AND LARGER SCALE MIXED INCOME AND AFFORDABLE MULTI FAMILY HOUSING. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS WE NEED TO BUILD BOTH A WE NEED TO BOTH BUILD MORE HOUSING AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY CITY IS DOING THEIR FAIR SHARE. TO PROVIDE A RANGE OF HOUSING TYPES AT A RANGE OF INCOME LEVELS. EVEN PLACES THAT HAVE TRADITIONALLY FROWNED UPON DENSITY THANK YOU AND BY WITNESSES SAID THAT ARE HERE TODAY ARE ON YOUR LAWLER WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY AND BRIAN AUGUSTA WITH THE CALIFORNIA. RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION. YOUR WITNESSES. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBER OF UNTIL OR WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY. THIS BILL IS REALLY TARGETED THE MOST HIGHLY EXCLUSIONARY JURISDICTIONS IN THE STATE THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL AT MAINTAINING LOW. RESIDENTIAL DENSITY PATTERNS MOSTLY SINGLE FAMILY IN PROVIDING VERY FEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR LOWER WAGE WORKERS TO LIVE -- THESE ARE COMMUNITIES THAT EMPLOYEE LOWER WAGE WORKERS -- BUT THOSE WORKERS CANNOT LIVE IN THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH THEY WORK BECAUSE THERE IS NO DANCE MULTI FAMILY OR AFFORDABLE HOUSING -- THE BILL ALLOWS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF BOTH MARKET RATE HOUSING AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND GIVE THE LAKE UP TO THOSE AFFORDABLE PROJECTS BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THOSE PROJECTS ARE GONNA HAVE THE MOST DIFFICULT TIME COMPETING FOR LAND IN THESE COMMUNITIES BECAUSE THEY DO TEND TO BE. HIGHER INCOME AND THAT'S THE LAND IS ALSO MORE EXPENSIVE SO -- WE THINK IT'S A REGIONAL APPROACH TO GET MORE NEEDED HOUSING IN THE PLACES WHERE IT IS LACKING -- AND WOULD ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. GOOD MORNING TURN MEMBERS BY A GUEST -- WITH CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION -- ECHO THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE JUST. NOTE THAT WE THINK THIS WILL BE AN IMPORTANT COMPLEMENT TO SOME THE OTHER TOOLS THAT ARE BEING DISCUSSED THIS YEAR. IN BOTH HOUSES TO IN INCREASED PRODUCTION AND PARTICULARLY HELP INCREASE PRODUCTION OF HOUSING. FOR THOSE MOST IN NEED OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE WOULD URGE AND I'VE OUT. THANK YOU LET ME ASK IF THERE ARE OTHER SUPPORTERS OF THIS MEASURE. I WE ARE CO SPONSORS OF THIS BILL I THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR AND HIS STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US AND WE ASK YOUR AYE VOTE THANKS. TYRONE BUCKLEY HOUSING CALIFORNIA STRONG SUPPORT. LET ME ASK IF THERE'S OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. LET'S BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY. QUESTIONS. I JUST WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR SUPPORTING NEW HOUSING VERTICALLY AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN HI RESOURCE AREAS -- THIS IS A BILL THAT I THINK WOULD PROVIDE MORE FOLKS WITH THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT THEY WANT PARTICULARLY FROM LOWER INCOME. COMMUNITIES AND FROM COMMUNITIES OF COLOR THAT HAVE BEEN SYSTEMATICALLY EXCLUDED FROM HIGH RESOURCE AREAS AND I AM GONNA BE SUPPORTING THIS TODAY AND LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING HOW THE CONVERSATION GOES DURING THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. WE DO NOT YET HAVE A QUORUM SO WE WILL HOLD THIS BILL. FOR A MOTION UNTIL WE DO AND WITHOUT -- MAYBE WILL EXCUSE US HAVE YOU FOR THIS FILE ITEM AND MOVE ON TO FILE ITEM. EIGHT THANK YOU THAT'S A. B. THIRTEEN NINETY NINE MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBER -- THE ELLIS ACT ALLOWS LANDLORDS TO EXIT -- THE BUSINESS OF OF RENTING GUIDE -- TO TENANTS -- HOWEVER SOME LANDLORDS ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF A PERCEIVED AMBIGUITY IN THE LAW BY DRIVING. A TENANTS OUT AND THEN RE RENTING. OF THE PROPERTY -- WHICH CONTRAVENES THE INTENTION OF THE ALICE ACT AS SOME LANDLORDS BELIEVE THAT -- THERE'S A LOOPHOLE THAT ALLOWS THEM TO RE RENT UNITS THAT WERE VACANT AT THE TIME OF THE WITHDRAWAL AT ANY TIME WITHOUT HEARING TO THE LAW'S RESTRICTIONS. ON UNITS RETURNED TO THE MARKET WITHIN CERTAIN TIME PERIODS. AND TO ADDRESS SAID THIS ODD -- MY PROPOSED LEGISLATION WILL CLARIFY THE ELSE ACT IN THE FOLLOWING WAYS. IF A LANDLORD WHO INTENDS TO GO OUT OF THE RENTAL BUSINESS PERMANENTLY -- THE BILL REQUIRES THOSE LANDLORDS TO PERMANENTLY GO OUT OF THE RENTAL BUSINESS. AND THIS WILL HELP PREVENT THE MORE EGREGIOUS ABUSES THAT ENCOURAGE LANDLORDS TO EMPTY ENTIRE BUILDINGS IN ORDER TO EVADE RENT LIMITATIONS. THIS WILL ALSO REDUCE THE INCENTIVE FOR LANDLORDS -- TO TO ALICE A PROPERTY AND THEN LET MUCH NEEDED HOUSING UNITS LIE FALLOW FOR MORE THAN FIVE YEARS SIMPLY SIMPLY SO THAT THEY CAN RE RENT THE UNITS AT MARKET RATES. IT WILL -- THE BILL WILL CLARIFY THAT THE ACT PROHIBITS THE RETURN TO THE RENTAL MARKET OF LESS THAN ALL THE UNITS IN THE SAME WAY THAT THE WITHDRAWAL OF LESS THAN ALL THE UNITS IS PROHIBITED. IN OTHER WORDS ONCE ANY UNIT IS RETURNED TO THE RENTAL MARKET THE ENTIRE PROPERTY IS CONSIDERED BACK ON THE RENTAL MARKET FOR PURPOSES OF THE ACT. FINALLY THE LAW -- WILL MAKE EXPLICIT THAT THE PAYMENT OF A PENALTY DOES NOT EXTINGUISH THE LANDLORDS OBLIGATION TO COMPLY WITH THE LAW. I'M HAPPY TO REPORT THAT WE'VE REACHED AN AGREEMENT WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS ON AMENDMENTS THAT WE WILL TAKE IN THE NEXT COMMITTEE. AND THAT WERE CLOSE TO REACHING AN AGREEMENT WITH THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION WHICH I HOPE TO HAVE RESOLVED BY THE NEXT HEARING IN A PARENTHETICALLY. I WOULD SAY THAT -- LAST YEAR WHEN I CARRIED THIS BILL -- WE HAD WORKED OUT TO AMENDMENTS WITH THE APARTMENT ASSOCIATION SO I THINK THERE'S A GOOD REASON TO BE OPTIMISTIC THAT WE WILL HAVE A FULL AGREEMENT WITH -- BOTH THE APARTMENT ASSOCIATION AND THE REALTORS -- AS OF THE NEXT HEARING -- THIS BILL GETS TENANTS SOME SECURITY AND KEEPING THEIR HOMES -- IN A TIME WHEN HOMELESSNESS FOR OUR POOR SENIORS DISABLED AND EVEN WORKING CLASS IS A REALITY THAT IS JUST A PAYCHECK OR RENT INCREASE AWAY DUE TO LACK. OF READILY AVAILABLE AFFORDABLE HOUSING [inaudible] YOUR WITNESSES. GOOD MORNING OF MY NAME IS ALLISON RING A DEPUTY CITY ATTORNEY FOR THE CITY OF WEST HOLLYWOOD -- UNFORTUNATELY WHAT WE'RE SEEING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IS A GROWING BELIEF AMONG LANDLORDS THAT THEY CAN EMPTY THE BUILDING BY USING ELLIS AND THEN CHERRY PICK WHICH UNITS TO PUT BACK ON THE RENTAL MARKET WHILE HOLDING BACK. OTHERS -- THE INCENTIVE IS. TO GET AS MANY TENANTS OUT OF THE BUILDING BEFORE SERVING ELLIS NOTICES BECAUSE OF THE UNIT IS VACANT WHEN THE ELLIS NOTICES SERVED THERE ARE NO RENT% RESTRICTIONS ON THAT UNIT GOING FORWARD. SO SOME LANDLORDS ARE USING THAT AMBIGUITY IN THE ELLIS ACT TO GET RID OF AS MANY TENANTS AS POSSIBLE THEN SERVE ELLIS NOTICE ON THOSE TENANTS WHO STAY. AND THE TENANTS WHO REMAIN ARE TYPICALLY THOSE THAT ARE MOST VULNERABLE TO HOMELESSNESS THEY'RE THE ONES WHO HAVE BEEN THERE THE LONGEST HOOVER PAYING THE LOWEST RENT AND IT'S THOSE TENANTS THAT ARE THE TARGET OF THIS TACTIC. AND SO ONCE THE ELLIS NOTICES ARE SERVED IN THOSE TENANTS ARE VICTIMS. THE LANDLORD WILL THEN RE RENT ONLY THOSE UNITS THAT ARE WITHOUT RENT RESTRICTIONS MISTAKENLY BELIEVING THAT THEY CAN HAVE ONE FOOT IN THE RENTAL MARKET AND ONE FOOT OUT. THIS BILL WILL CLARIFY THAT YOU'RE EITHER ON THE RENTAL MARKET OR YOU'RE OFF TO PREVENT THOSE KIND OF INCENDIARY TACTICS WE WOULD -- DRIVE OUT THANK YOU. NONE THANK YOU BYE HAVE BRIGHT ACOSTA WITH THE SANTA MONICA RENT CONTROL BOARD IN THE CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION IN. SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE I JUST WANNA. QUICKLY. ADD THAT -- IN ANSWER THAT SIMPLE -- SUMMARY OF THIS BILL IS REALLY THAT WERE CLARIFYING THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE ALICE ACT I THINK -- BAD SIMPLE CLARIFICATION. THAT IS -- IS EVIDENCED BY WHERE WE ARE WITH OUR DISCUSSIONS IN -- WITH INDUSTRY GROUPS WHICH IS THAT WE'VE GOT THE REALTORS OFTEN WORKING WITH CA WE THINK IT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE ACT. AS MS REGAN SAID YOU'RE EITHER IN OR OUT THERE'S ONE THE WHOLE BUILDING IS IN OR THE WHOLE BUILDING IS OUT THAT'S ALL THIS BILL. IS INTENDED TO CLARIFY AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE WOULD URGE IN ABOUT. LET ME ASK IF THERE ARE OTHER SUPPORTERS OF THE BILL. SHOP HER EXACT LOOK AT COMPOUND AND ONE THANK US SERGEANT I'M NOT SURE IF THE MICROPHONE IS ON SOMEONE JUST. DOUBLE CHECK THAT WELL LET ME ASK NOW IF THERE'S OPPOSITION. DEBORAH CURLED WITH A CALIFORNIA APARTMENT CESSATION I WON'T SAID BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO FIND THE ANSWERS THAT WE NEED.

SO I THINK ALL OF US HAVE EXPERIENCED IN OUR DISTRICT ISSUES WITH -- RENTAL INCREASES EVICTIONS HOMELESSNESS THE COST OF LIVING BEING EXTRAORDINARILY EXPENSIVE I KNOW IN MY DISTRICT OF THE EAST BAY THE BEAUTIFUL EAST BAY AS I LIKE TO REFER TO IT. YOU KNOW WE HAVE CHALLENGES TEACHERS CAN AFFORD TO LIVE THERE ANYMORE. ON THEIR LIVING IN STOCKTON IN TRACING COMMUTING TO OAKLAND AND BERKELEY SO WE WE HEAR ABOUT THESE ISSUES I KNOW ALL OF US HERE ABOUT THIS IN OUR DISTRICTS. AND WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE A HOUSING CRISIS AND IT'S IT'S REACHED ON PRESIDENT LEVELS THIS IS A MID MAJOR SHE FOR THIS LEGISLATURE IN A MAJOR ISSUE. FOR THE GOVERNOR AS WELL. WE DON'T HAVE IS CONFERENCE OF STATEWIDE DATA. TO ACTUALLY LOOK AT THE ISSUE AND HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING. I'M FROM AN EMPIRICAL POINT OF VIEW OF THE CHALLENGES THAT FACE OUR COMMUNITIES AND YOU KNOW WHAT ARE THE RENT INCREASES YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT ARE WE SAYING ARE WE SEEING TRENDS WE HAVE. YOU KNOW. YOU KNOW ZILLOW AND OTHERS ARE ARE ARE GIVING SOME INFORMATION THAT THAT EFFECT BUT THE THE GOAL OF THIS BILLS TO REALLY CREATE A STATEWIDE RENTAL. REGISTRY SO WE CAN GET THAT DATA FROM LANDLORDS HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF A WHAT IS FACING OUR COMMUNITIES. I'VE SPENT TIME TALKING WITH BOTH TENANTS RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS AS WELL AS THE APARTMENT ASSOCIATION AND AND MY LOCAL LANDLORDS IN MY DISTRICT -- ABOUT SOME OF THESE ISSUES AND FRANKLY YOU KNOW IN TALKING TO MY LOCAL LANDLORDS THEY ARE ALSO HUNGRY FOR THIS DATA AS WELL -- AS OUR OUR TENANTS AND SO THAT IS WHAT A FUNDAMENTALLY THIS BILL WILL DO IT WILL CREATE A STATEWIDE RENTAL REGISTRY THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. TO ANNUALLY COLLECT THE DATA ON RENTAL UNIT INCREASES TENTATIVE ACTIONS AND UNIT VACANCIES FROM LANDLORDS AND PROPERTY OWNERS. I AM COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE APARTMENT ASSOCIATION -- TO TO FIGURE OUT A SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM -- AND WITH ME TO TESTIFY HERE IS KATHARINE BREEZY FROM TECH EQUITY -- I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANKS FOR OUR FOR HAVING ME -- I'M CATHY BRACEY I FOUNDED AND DIRECT THE TECH EQUITY COLLABORATIVE WHICH IS AN ORGANIZATION BASED IN THE BAY AREA -- THAT BELIEVES THAT THE STATE'S TECH DRIVEN ECONOMY CAN AND SHOULD CREATE BROAD BASED OPPORTUNITY FOR MORE PEOPLE -- OUR CORE MEMBERSHIP CONSISTS OF RANK AND FILE TECH WORKERS WHO WANT TO USE THEIR UNIQUE POWER AS RESIDENTS OF THE STATE TO PUSH FOR POLICY CHANGES THAT WILL. ALLOW THE BENEFITS THAT ARE INDUSTRIES CREATING -- TO CREATE A MORE PEOPLE AND OF COURSE SOLVING HOUSING CRISIS IS OBVIOUSLY A CRITICAL ELEMENT OF THAT EQUATION -- AS TECH WORKERS WE ARE ACUTELY AWARE OF THE IMPACT WE'RE HAVING ON HOUSING COSTS IN CALIFORNIA WE ALSO FEEL THAT CRISIS AS MANY OF US PAY MORE THAN WELL MORE THAN A THIRD OF OUR INCOMES AND FOR HOUSING -- WE KNOW THAT THIS IS PARTICULARLY UNSUSTAINABLE FOR OUR NEIGHBORS WHO ARE NURSES TEACHERS BUS DRIVERS. JANITORS AND OTHERS TO DO THE CRITICAL WORK THAT OUR COMMUNITIES NEED TO THRIVE. AND FOR OUR NEIGHBORS HAVE BEEN MADE HOMELESS OR BEEN DISPLACED OUT OF THE REGION BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING -- AS TECH WORKERS WE ALSO UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING A RELIABLE DATA TO INFORM DECISION MAKING AND OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS OF WE AS WE HAVE BEGUN TO ENGAGE IN HOUSING ADVOCACY WORK WE HAVE FOUND THAT THE POLICY CONVERSATION AROUND TEN A PROTECTIONS IN PARTICULAR -- IS TAKING PLACE IN THE ABSENCE OF REAL DATA ABOUT THE EXTENT OF THE PROBLEM -- THE TRUTH IS NO ONE REALLY KNOWS HOW MUCH RENTS ARE INCREASING ACROSS THE STATE THE THE DATA THAT DOES EXIST FROM PLACES LIKE THE AMERICAN COMMUNITY SURVEY OR COMPANIES LIKE ZILLOW -- ARE INSUFFICIENT IN MANY WAYS THEIR PROPRIETARY THEY'RE EXPENSIVE THEY AREN'T COMPREHENSIVE AND THEY TEND TO REPORT SORT OF TOP LINE DATA SUCH AS AVERAGES. IN ORDER TO MAKE SMART HOUSING POLICY WE NEED GRANULAR TRANSPARENT AND COMPREHENSIVE DATA ABOUT RENTAL PRICES THAT CAN ONLY BE GATHERED BY ASKING LANDLORDS TO SUBMIT THAT DATA DIRECTLY. AND WE'RE HAPPY TO STAND WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER WICKS ON THIS BILL AND ARE URGING ALL OF YOU TO SUPPORT WITH AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU. AND AND JUST TO ADD ON TO THAT AS WELL IF I COULD CHAIRMAN -- YOU KNOW THE GOAL OF THIS IS TO HAVE -- AND CREATE EVIDENCE BASED POLICY BASED ON DATA AND THERE ARE SOME CITIES THAT DO HAVE RENTAL REGISTRIES LOS ANGELES FRESNO -- AND OTHERS BUT THIS WOULD BE A STATEWIDE SYSTEM THAT WE COULD -- YOU SO ORGANIZATIONS LIKE TECH EQUITY AND OTHERS THE TURNER CENTER OTHER ORGANIZATIONS TENDS GROUP'S LANDLORD ORGANIZATIONS WILL HAVE THE DATA THEY NEED. THANK YOU LET'S GO TO OTHER SUPPORTERS. ON A LAWLER WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY IN SUPPORT. HE LUIS MONTI WITH CALIFORNIA MEANS TRANSPORT. IF YOU'RE MEMBERS RAND MARTIN ON BEHALF OF THE AIDS HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. BUT NOW WE HEAR FROM ANY OPPOSITION. HI GOOD MORNING AGAIN MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS -- CREAM GREASY ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS -- IS INTRODUCED US HERE HAD AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON AB -- SEVEN TWENTY FOUR AS THE BILL WOULD HAVE IMPOSED ON OUR STANDARDS ON SMALL LANDLORDS. SEE OURS RECENTLY REACHED A CONCEPTUAL AGREEMENT WITH THE AUTHOR REGARDING AMENDMENTS -- THIS AMENDMENT WOULD EXEMPT SMALL LANDLORDS WHO OWN OR MANAGE. RESIDENTIAL REAL PROPERTY WITH FIFTEEN UNITS ARE LESS FROM THE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL -- BASED ON THE OTHERS COMMITMENT TO AMEND THE BILL SEE OURS NO NEUTRAL ON THE MEASURE AND SEE I WOULD CERTAINLY LIKE TO THINK THE AUTHOR HER STAFF -- AS WELL AS THE SPONSOR AND COMMITTEE COMMITTEE STAFF -- FOR THEIR WORK WITH US -- TELL THIS CAN RESOLVE OUR CONCERNS ON THIS MEASURE -- WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE IT -- WE HAVE SENT A MOCK UP OF THE AMENDMENT TO THE AUTHORS OFFICE AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF AND WE CERTAINLY LOOK FORWARD -- TO WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE -- ON FINALIZING THAT AMENDMENT LANGUAGE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. AT DEVER CARL TO THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION I THINK WE WOULD ARGUE THAT THE SOLUTIONS NOT A DATABASE BUT NOW IT'S GOING TO TAKE OUT 75% OF THE RENTAL HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA IT'S NO LONGER STATEWIDE DATABASE -- BUT IT'S REALLY ABOUT IT SHOULD BE ABOUT A DATABASE OF ABOUT BUILDING HOUSING AND WE'VE ARGUED FOR THE IMPORTANCE OF FINDING AND BUILDING MORE HOUSING SO THAT OUR TEACHERS CAN LIVE CLOSE. I'M OUR CONCERN OF COURSE IS THE BIG PRIVACY INVASION NOT ONLY FOR RENTAL PROPERTY OWNERS BUT FOR TENANTS A LIGHT THEIR NEIGHBORS ARE GONNA NOW NO. THEY'VE GONE FOR WHAT REASON PERHAPS IT IS A FICTION PERHAPS THAT INFORMATION IS ALREADY MASKED IN THE COURTS. WE DON'T WANT TO AT LEAST EXPOSE ALL OF THAT INFORMATION PLUS IF YOU ENDED UP WITH SIX MILLION RENTAL UNITS IN THIS SYSTEM IN A MATTER OF NINETY DAYS. I WOULD SAY THAT'S AN EXPENSIVE A PROPOSITION THAT DOESN'T REALLY PROVIDE US ANY KIND OF SOLUTIONS THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR SO TODAY WE'RE ASKING FOR YOUR NO VOTE. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS PAT RIGHT WITH THEIR AND READING ASSOCIATES REPRESENTING THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA RENTAL HOUSING ASSOCIATION WE APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS THAT -- THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER TOOK WHAT THE TAKE THAT BACK -- TO OUR CLIENT HAVE THEM LOOK AT THAT TO SEE THAT ALL ALTER THEIR POSITION ON THE BILL -- WE DO KNOW THERE'S ONE AMENDMENT THAT SHE COULD TAKE THAT WOULD REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION COMPLETELY IS THE SHE EXEMPTED -- SIX OWNERS WITH SIXTEEN OR MORE UNITS BUT THAT'S PROBABLY NOT HAPPEN. IN LIGHT OF THAT WE ARE WE ARE WE AS WE REMAIN OPPOSED TO THE BILL BUT WE'LL TAKE A LOOK AT THE AMENDMENTS AND SEE IF THAT CHANGES A POSITION THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING SURE MEMBERS KATE ON THE CALIFORNIA RENTAL HOUSING ASSOCIATION WE'RE ALSO GOING TO REVIEW THE AMENDMENTS TAKE A DOCTOR MEMBERSHIP -- BUT WE ARE CONCERNED WITH THE BILL BECAUSE OF THE SHARING OF PRIVATE INFORMATION AND ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN SO THEREFORE OPPOSED THANK YOU. LET'S BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS MISTER MAIENSCHEIN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR I I APPRECIATE ALL THE CONVERSATIONS THAT I'VE HAD WITH THE AUTHOR I KNOW YOU'VE WORKED VERY HARD ON THIS -- IN I DEFINITELY UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO -- I KNOW IT'S STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE -- WORKING WITH -- THAT THE PARTIES INVOLVED THE AMENDMENT -- TO EXCLUDE PROPERTIES AT PROPERTY SMALLER FIFTEEN YEARS SO IT WAS GOOD BECAUSE IT. KINDA GETS TO THOSE MOM AND POP -- ONCE A MIGHT HAVE A HARDER TIME COMPLYING JUST -- FROM A LACK OF A BAND WITH ISSUE I WANT TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY -- COULD BECAUSE I APPRECIATE YOUR HARD WORK AND I APPRECIATE YOUR A COMMITMENT TO KEEP -- THE CONVERSATION MOVING. MY HOPE BY THE TIME IT'S A FOR SOME OF THESE OTHER ISSUES CAN BE WORKED OUT BUT HAPPY TO SUPPORT IT TODAY THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENTS MR YEP. OF THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I GUESS HAVE A QUESTION -- FOR OF THIS WAS CALLED IN A OUR WITNESS OF DEBORAH YOU YOU MENTIONED THAT THE AMENDMENT WILL TAKE AWAY WHAT 75% OF OF WHAT. CAN YOU CLARIFY THAT THE SIXTEEN IF IF THE AUTHOR ACCEPTS THE AMENDMENTS FOR SIXTEEN OR FOR YOUR UNITS THAT IS THE BULK. OF RENTAL HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA. SO WE BELIEVE THAT THAT'S NOT GOING TO GIVE THE AUTHOR THE STATEWIDE DATABASE THAT SHE WANTS NOT THAT WE WOULD SUPPORT IF SHE HAD A BACK IN. SECOND I CAN'T. BUT I DON'T THINK IT ACCOMPLISHES WE HAVE ARGUED THAT THERE'S ALREADY PLENTY OF DATA OUT THERE -- ON PUBLIC WEBSITES ON THE SENSES THE DATA THAT YOU CAN ALREADY CLEAN THAT THE COURTS ALREADY HAVE AN EVICTION SYSTEM. A REPORTING SYSTEM IN WHICH YOU COULD GET EVICTION INFORMATION AS WELL SO WORK REQUIRING WHAT WAS ONCE SIX MILLION UNITS TO BE TO COME INTO A SYSTEM. IS REALLY -- NOT NECESSARY I THINK WE GET THE DATA OTHER PLACES IN A MORE ECONOMICAL WAY. I'M NOT SURE WE HAVE CORM YET BUT I I AND AND THE SHERIN I WAS SAID ABOUT THE THE AUTHOR THIS BILL HAS. HAS HAD MULTIPLE CONVERSATION WITH ME ON IT OF COURSE WE STILL HAVE SOME CONCERNS -- I WILL -- NOT BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY BUT I DO LOOK FORWARD -- TO SUPPORTING ON THE FLOOR IF SHE'S ABLE TO REACH SOME SORT OF AGREEMENT -- WITH THE OPPOSITION GREAT -- MS WHICH HAVE A COMMENT WE WANTED TO ADDRESS THE PRIVACY ISSUE. PLEASE YEAH I WOULD SAY THAT WERE ALSO VERY COMMITTED TO PRIVACY INDIVIDUAL PRIVACY WE'VE AGREED TO ADOPT AN AMENDMENT -- THAT WOULD MAKE SURE THAT THIS -- DATABASE CAN -- COMPLIES WITH ALL STATE LAWS -- ON ON IN TERMS OF PRIVACY -- AND TO BE CLEAR THE DATA THAT WE WOULD BE SUGGESTING THAT WE'RE COLLECTING IS NOT SPECIFIC TO INDIVIDUALS AT SPECIFIC TWO APARTMENT UNITS -- WE DON'T NEED THE ACTUAL ADDRESS LIKE UNIT NUMBER OF THE APARTMENT WE JUST NEED TO KNOW UNIQUELY YOU KNOW IF THERE ARE. TWENTY UNITS IN THIS -- BUILDING UNIT ONE THROUGH TWENTY HAS X. NUMBER OF BEDROOMS AND THE RENT IS X. -- AMOUNTS AND HAS CHANGED YEAR OVER YEAR I DON'T THINK THAT THAT WOULD VIOLATE THE PRIVACY OF OF ANY INDIVIDUAL WHO LIVES IN THAT BUILDING OR THE OR THE LANDLORD FOR THAT MATTER. I JUST WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR MOVING THIS IMPORTANT TOPIC FORD WOW WE ALL KNOW THAT RENTERS AND TENANTS ARE IN THE MOST. INTENSE CRISIS THAT THEY HAVE BEEN IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY AND WE'RE HAVING MANY DISCUSSIONS ABOUT DIFFERENT IDEAS OF HOW TO ADDRESS THE CRISIS -- AND I THINK WE WOULD ALL AGREE ON BOTH SIDES OF THE EQUATION THAT HAVING DATA HAVING FAX WOULD BETTER INFORM THIS. UP ONE THING I I I DO UNDERSTAND FROM THE OPPOSITION THAT YOU BELIEVE THERE ARE OTHER SOURCES FOR US TO RECEIVE THIS DATA. I HAVE TO ADMIT THATI HAVEN'T SEEN THEM AND SO IF YOU WANT TO PROVIDE US WITH THAT DATA AND INFORMATION I WOULD WE LOVE TO SEE WHATEVER YOU FEEL LIKE WE CAN CLEAN -- BUT SINCE WE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT I THINK WE HAVE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH SOME SORT OF DATA COLLECTION BILL. I WANT TO THANK -- THE COMPANY'S DECISION REALTORS FOR YOUR WORK WITH THE AUTHOR I WOULD HAVE PREFERRED THIS TO BE A LOWER THRESHOLD -- AND CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS GOING -- TO IT MEAN THAT WE WILL HAVE LESS DATA BUT I THINK HAVING SOME DATA IS BETTER THAN HAVING NO DATA AND WITH THAT -- GLAD THERE WAS AN UNDERSTANDING AND HOW WE MOVE THIS FORWARD -- THIS ITEM THE SENATE MOVES OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE WILL MOVE TO THE ASSEMBLY JUDICIARY COMMITTEE ON WHICH I ALSO SET SO I'M SURE THIS CONVERSATION WILL CONTINUE. WITH THE OPPOSITION BUT ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE JUST ESTABLISH A QUORUM SO. LET ME JUST -- IN MY COMMENTS AND IF THERE'S NO OTHER QUESTIONS ASK THE AUTHOR IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING YOU LIKE TO SAY IN CLOSING SURE I WOULD JUST WANT TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE MEMBERS ON THIS COMMITTEE -- THE OPPOSITION AND THE STAKEHOLDERS OF THE SPONSORS OF THIS BILL TO GET THIS BILL TO A PLACE WHERE WE CAN ALL VOTE FOR ON THE FLOOR -- AND I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE IN THIS COMMITTEE TO MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND WHAT WE MOVE TO YOUR NEXT ITEM FILE ITEM ELEVEN AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY FIVE THE CO. TWO I WANT TO AGAIN THANK THE CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE -- FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY -- AS I'VE EXPLAINS PREVIOUSLY MY LAST BILL WE ARE IN A HOUSING CRISIS I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST COMMONLY REFERRED TO ISSUES THAT YOU'LL HEAR -- IN THIS BODY -- CURRENTLY NOW -- THE THE GOVERNOR HAS SAID WE NEED TO BUILD THREE POINT FIVE MILLION HOMES -- AS WE KNOW BUILDING HOMES HAS BEEN A CHALLENGE -- IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT IT IS CRITICAL WE NEED TO BUILD HOMES AT ALL INCOME LEVELS HERE -- IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND WE'VE TAKEN CERTAINLY -- MANY ON THIS COMMITTEE AND OTHERS WHO COME BEFORE ME IS I AM A FRESHMAN HERE -- HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS ISSUE FOR A LONG TIME AND OF PUT FORTH VERY THOUGHTFUL POLICIES TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO THAT WE CAN IN FACT BILL MORE HOME SEVENTY TWO IN OUR COMMUNITY. AND IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN GOVERNOR BROWN SIGNED SB THIRTY FIVE SENATOR SCOTT WINNERS BILL -- INTO LAW TO STREAMLINE AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS PROVIDING ON SITE AFFORDABILITY. HOWEVER SB THIRTY FIVE HAS ONLY BEEN EFFECTIVE FOR PRODUCING HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS IN A VERY SPECIFIC INCOME CATEGORY. MY BILL AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY FIVE WILL EXPAND EXISTING STREAMLINING LAWS TO ENCOURAGE MIXED INCOME HOUSING PRODUCTION -- FOR MODERATE INCOME HOUSING IN THE NINE COUNTY BAY AREA IS THE NINE COUNTIES IN THE BAY AREA -- IS WHAT THIS BILL WOULDN'T WHAT IMPACT -- HERE TO TESTIFY WITH ME IS A MATT REGAN FROM THE BAY AREA COUNCIL -- AND MICHAEL LANE IT AS VIÃ§T HOME AND I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. MISTER REAGAN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- I MATT READING WITH THE BAY AREA COUNCIL WE ARE A BUSINESS SPOSORED PUBLIC POLICY ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION. OUR MEMBERSHIPS COMPRISES ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY OF THE LARGEST EMPLOYERS IN THE BAY AREA. OUR NUMBER ONE ISSUE OF CONCERN IS -- THE AFFORDABILITY CRISIS IN OUR REGION IT HAS -- AND WENT A BIT TO BORE YOUR BILL LABOR YOU'VE HEARD IT MANY TIMES I'M SURE BUT WE ARE. PERHAPS THE MOST EXPENSIVE REGION IN THE NATION I THINK SEVENTEEN OF THE TOP TWENTY RENTAL MARKETS IN THE UNITED STATES ARE IN OUR REGION -- IT'S A PLACE WHERE -- NONE BUT THE VERY WEALTHIEST COULD AFFORD TO LIVE AND THAT'S A PROBLEM FOR ALL OF OUR MEMBERS -- AVERAGE RENTS IN SAN FRANCISCO RIGHT NOW FOR A ONE BEDROOM OR NORTH OF THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS A DOOR IN THE REGION AS A WHOLE IT'S BETWEEN TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS AND THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS. AVERAGE CONSTRUCTION COSTS AND SAN FRANCISCO ARE ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A UNIT -- FOR THE REGION IT'S OVER SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A UNIT -- WE'RE SEEING COST INFLATION FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF HOUSING AT ABOUT A TOOL REALLY AVAILABLE TO US TO ADDRESS WHAT WE CALL THE DONUT HOLE THE MISSING MIDDLE WORKFORCE HAS -- THERE'S OBVIOUSLY SOME FUNDING AVAILABLE FOR SUBSIDIZED BELOW MARKET RATE HOUSING OBVIOUSLY NOT ENOUGH BUT SOME SO THERE'S SOME ACTIVITY THERE. THE MARKET CAN AFFORD TO BUILD FOR NONE BUT THE WEALTHIEST AND THE DONUT HOLE IN THE MIDDLE -- OUR TEACHERS ARE CHILD CARE WORKERS. TWO TWO INCOME FAMILIES -- COULD NOT AFFORD TO LIVE IN THE BAY AREA A FAMILY OF TWO TEACHERS -- DOESN'T QUALIFY IN MOST OF OUR REGION FOR SUBSIDIZED HOUSING AND CAN'T AFFORD MARKET RATE HOUSING. THIS BILL PROVIDES A VERY SIMPLE TOOL TO INCENTIVIZE BUILDERS OF HOMES -- TO BUILD MARKET RATE OF MARKET RATE HOUSING FOR THE MISSING MIDDLE PROVIDES IN THE CENTER AN INCENTIVE FOR THEM TO BUILD A PRODUCT THE TWO TEACHERS CAN CAN AFFORD SO I ARCHER I NEXT WITNESS CHURCH IN MEMBERS A MICHAEL A MUSCLE KIND BELLY AT HOME. HOUSING ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION REPRESENT THE SENATE SANTA CLARA COUNTY -- AS NOTED THERE COUPLE POLICY POINTERS ONE EMPHASIZED IS A SUMMER WORK SAID THIS IS REALLY ORIGINAL BILL FOCUSED ON THE HIGH COST AND FRANCISCO BAY AREA AS A PILOT -- AND THE GOAL OF COURSE TO PROVIDE HOUSING FOR THOSE WHO MAKE WHO WEREN'T TOO MUCH. TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS SUBSIDIZE AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUT NOT ENOUGH REALLY TO COMPETE IN THE MARKET FOR HIGHER UP PRICE MARKET RATE UNITS TO TRY TO CREATE A NEW BELOW MARKET RATE IS WE BELOW MARKET RATE UNITS. WITHOUT HAVING TO USE STATE AND LOCAL SUBSIDIES AND THAT'S THE OTHER KEY POINT THE REASON THAT WE'RE REALLY HERE. IN PARTICULAR IN SUPPORT OF THE BILLS WERE SEEN A MOVEMENT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AT THE STATE MORE PRESSURE TO DIVERT. FINITE AND PRECIOUS AFFORDABLE HOUSING RESOURCE DIPPED OF HOUSEHOLDS OF HIGHER AND HIGHER INCOMES. AND WE REALLY TO TARGET THOSE RESOURCES -- AT LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS FOR A 100% AFFORDABLE HOUSING SO THE IDEAS CAN WE COME UP WITH ANOTHER PROGRAM THAT DOESN'T REQUIRE TO TREAT THOSE THOSE THOSE FIGHTING PRESSURES. RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THIS BELOW MARKET RATE. HOUSING AVAILABLE FOR THOSE WITH HIGHER INCOMES IN THAT WE THINK THAT'S A BETTER PUBLIC POLICY APPROACH. AND THAT'S THE REASON WE'RE HERE FOR EXAMPLE SB TO OR FROM THE SOURCE FUNDING. DID ALLOCATE SOME FUNDING FOR MIDDLE INCOME AND IS YOU KNOW GOVERNOR NEWSOME IS ALSO PROPOSED ALLOCATE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN THE STATE BUDGET. TWO COUCHES HIS BIGGEST INCOME PROGRAM WHICH GOES UP OF A IN MY SO WE THINK THOSE EFFORTS ARE FINE BUT THERE WON'T BE SUFFICIENT SUBSIDIES REALLY TO MAKE HEM UP TO THAT HAVE A LOT OF THE SCALE. SO WE THINK A PROGRAM LIKE THIS IS APPROPRIATE PARTICULARLY IN IN HIGH CAN A HIGH COST AREA -- TO TRY THIS TO BE ABLE DELIVER BELOW MARKET RATE UNITS WITHOUT USING A SUB RESOURCES AND WE ARE DRIVE OUT. THANK YOU OTHER SUPPORTERS. HOLLY FOR MANY WITH WHITE HOUSE PUBLIC AFFAIRS ON BEHALF OF HABITAT FOR HUMANITY EAST BAY SILICON VALLEY IN SUPPORT. KEEP THE ROW ENTERPRISE COMMITTEE PARTNERS [inaudible] OTHER SUPPORTERS. IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION. MICHELLE PERCENT WITH PUBLIC ADVOCATES -- WE HAVE NOT TAKEN A FORMAL POSITION ON THIS BILL BUT WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS REGARDING THE EXPANSIONS TO SB. THIRTY FIVE AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR BEFORE THE NEXT COMMITTEE THANKS. GREAT LET'S BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY DISCUSSION MR DEBORAH.

FOURTEEN EIGHTY THREE I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR ATTENTION TO THIS BILL AND NOTE THAT I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS OUTLINED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. TOO MUCH OF THE HOUSING DATA COLLECTED AT THE STATE REGIONAL AND LOCAL LEVEL IS NOT ACCESSIBLE STANDARDIZED OR ORGANIZED IN A MANNER THAT LEVERAGES OUR EXTENSIVE COMMUNITY OF HOUSING RESEARCHERS AND ADVOCATES. AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY THREE WILL DO THE FOLLOWING REQUIRE EIGHT CD TO DEVELOP AND COORDINATE A STATEWIDE PARCEL DATABASE THAT WILL PROVIDE AN OPEN AND FLEXIBLE FRAMEWORK FOR ORGANIZING THE STATE'S HOUSING DATA. REQUIRE CITIES AND COUNTIES TO TRANSPARENTLY PUBLISH A VARIETY OF HOUSING DEVELOPMENT PIPELINE DATA INCLUDING FEES APPLICABLES TO HOUSING DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS AND INFORMATION RELEVANT TO THE PER -- PRESERVATION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND THE PROTECTION OF TENANTS AND HOMEOWNERS REQUIRE CITIES AND COUNTIES TO REPORT ANNUALLY ON INFORMATION THAT WILL HELP US. TO UNDERSTAND THE PROGRESS THEY ARE MAKING ON APPROVING HOUSING INCLUDING THE NUMBER OF DISCRETIONARY PERMITS BUILDING PERMITS AS A TRAFFIC IT'S OF OCCUPANCY ISSUED. FINALLY THE BILL WILL REQUIRE A CD TO DEVELOP A TENURE DATA STRATEGY IN THAT STATE HOUSING PLAN TO ENSURE THAT ALL FUTURE DATA REQUIREMENTS. ARE COORDINATED AND THAT JURISDICTION'S ARE SUPPORTED IN THEIR ROLES. I AM PLEASED TO BE WORKING WITH THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS ON OUR SPECIFIC DATA REQUEST TO BE SURE THAT WE ARE FOCUSED.

TO DETERMINE NEW POST EARTHQUAKE BUILDING PERFORMANCE STANDARDS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ESSENTIAL FACILITIES LIKE HOSPITALS AND FIRE STATIONS CURRENT BUILDING CODE IS ONLY DESIGNED TO PROTECT AGAINST LOSS OF LIFE. IF A MAJOR EARTHQUAKE HITS THE CODE SAYS NOTHING ABOUT WHETHER OR WHEN A BUILDING WILL BE EIGHT UNABLE. A USABLE AFTER A LARGE SEISMIC EVENT. EVEN NEW BUILDINGS ARE EXPECTED TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT REPAIR COSTS AND DOWNTIME AFTER A MAJOR CALIFORNIA EARTHQUAKE. PEOPLE WITH DISPLACED. WOULD BE DISPLACED FROM THEIR HOMES AND WOULD FACE A SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTION TO THE REGIONAL ECONOMY THIS BILL DEFINES A FUNCTIONAL RECOVERY STANDARD AS DESIGN CRITERIA. AND REGULATIONS SUCH AS BUILDING STRUCTURE ARCHITECTURE AND SYSTEMS WOULD MAINTAIN THEIR INTEGRITY OR COULD BE RESTORED TO SUPPORT BASIC FUNCTIONS OF THE BUILDING SPREE EARTHQUAKE USE WITHIN A MAXIMUM ACCEPTABLE TIME. WHICH COULD DEPEND ON BUILDING OCCUPANCY. IT REQUIRES THE C. B. S. C. TO CONVENE A WORKING GROUP TO DETERMINE IF A FUNCTIONAL RECOVERY BUILDING STANDARD IS WARRANTED. AND TO INVESTIGATE PRACTICAL MEANS FOR IMPLEMENTING STANDARDS. AB THREE NINETY THREE IS A STEP TOWARD ENABLING CALIFORNIA TO GET BACK TO NORMAL SOON AFTER A LARGE EARTHQUAKE INSTEAD OF HAVING BUILDINGS CLOSED. FOR MONTHS OR YEARS AT A TIME WHICH WE'VE EXPERIENCED IN MAJOR CITIES IN OUR STATE. I'M JOINED BY STRUCTURAL ENGINEER RYAN CHRIS THING CHAIR OF THE STRUCTURAL ENGINEERS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE ACTION COMMITTEE. AND JOHN PARISH FORMER CALIFORNIA STATE GEOLOGIST ON BEHALF OF THE EARTHQUAKE ENGINEERING RESEARCH INSTITUTE. YOU'RE WITH US AS GREAT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITIES GUS THE IMPORTANCE OF AB THREE NINETY THREE I'M RANCOR STING A PRACTICING STRUCTURAL ENGINEER HERE IN TOWN. SACRAMENTO SPEAKING TODAY ON BEHALF OF OUR THIRTY FIVE HUNTER MEMBERS OF THE STRUCTURAL ENGINEERS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. WHO ARE THE EXPERTS WHEN IT COMES TO UNDERSTANDING THE SEISMIC PERFORMANCE OF OUR BUILDINGS? THE SENTIMENT IS THERE AND GIVE A GREAT SYNOPSIS OF THE BILL SO I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT A FEW KEY POINTS. UP FIRST WE ARE STRUCTURED ENGINEERS KNOW THAT OUR BUILDING CODES ARE FOCUS PRIMARILY IN PROVIDING LIFE SAFETY WE ALSO REALIZE THAT THE PUBLIC DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THIS. WE KNOW THAT THE PUBLIC -- AND MANY OF YOU AND LOCAL LEADERS HAVE START ASK US WHAT CAN WE DO TO DO DIFFERENTLY OR BETTER REGARDING THE RECOVERY ASPECTS NOT JUST THE SAFETY ASPECTS OF pOPPORTUNITY. TO RESPOND TO THAT DESIRE AND INTEREST FOR SOMETHING DIFFERENT OR BETTER IN TERMS OF PERFORMANCE -- THIS BILL EXPLORE INVOLVING OUR BUILDING CODES PROTECT NOT JUST LIFE SAFETY BUT OUR WAY OF LIFE. BY CONSIDERING HOW WE CAN RECOVER AFTER AN EARTHQUAKE. TO THIS BILL DOES NOT MANDATE AN IMMEDIATE CHANGE BUT RATHER INITIATES THE PROCESS FOR KEY STAKEHOLDERS. FROM ACROSS ACROSS THE BUILDING DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY TO DISCUSS. HOW TO BETTER PROTECT INDIVIDUALS AND OUR COMMUNITIES? THE STATE'S ROLE IN THIS CAN BE IN THIS GROUP IS REALLY IMPORTANT WE NEED AND APPRECIATE THE LEADERSHIP OF OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS TO BRING CREDIBILITY. FOCUS AND PRIORITY TO THESE DISCUSSIONS. THIRD THESE ACTIVITIES WILL BE INFORMED BY AND WE'LL COMPLIMENTS BUT NOT DUPLICATE EFFORTS HAPPENING AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL. C. OCAS AWARE OF ENGAGE IN THE EFFORTS THAT THE KNEE HER AGENCIES NESTON FEMA HAVE BEEN TASKED WITH AND ARE ABOUT TO BEGIN. IN FACT ARE WORKING GROUP WILL BE ORGANIZED RIGHT AS THE IT WILL NOT BE A NEW STANDARD CODE YET. OUR AB THREE NINETY THREE WORKING GROUP CAN DISCUSS HOW OR IF THOSE OPTIONS MIGHT APPLY TO CALIFORNIA. WE'RE ALSO ENGAGED IN THE SEPARATE -- CO DEVELOP A PROCESS FOR THE NATIONAL MODEL CODE AS WELL AS THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING CODE. AND THE TIMING OF OUR THREE NINETY THREE WORKING GROUP IS SUCH THAT OUR EFFORTS IN CALIFORNIA COULD BECOME THE BASIS FOR THE DISCUSSION AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL CALIFORNIA ONCE AGAIN LEAD IN THE SEISMIC SAFETY AND SEISMIC RECOVERY FOR OUR COMMUNITY SIAC IS PROUD. TO SPONSOR AND SUPPORT THIS IMPORTANT BILL AND REQUEST AN ENCOURAGE YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING UP MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ON JOHN PARISH REPRESENTING THE EARTHQUAKE ENGINEERING RESEARCH INSTITUTE. E. R. I. IS A NATIONAL NONPROFIT TECHNICAL SOCIETY OF EXPERTS DEDICATED TO REDUCING EARTHQUAKE RISK IT'S MEMBERS INCLUDE PROFESSIONALS -- IN A WIDE RANGE OF SEISMIC SAFETY RELATED SCIENTIFIC AND ENGINEERING DISCIPLINES. CALIFORNIA IS THE MOST SEISMICALLY ACTIVE STATE IN THE NATION OUTSIDE OF ALASKA. HOWEVER BECAUSE OF THE STATE'S VERY LARGE AND COMPLEX INFRASTRUCTURE AND DYNAMIC ECONOMY 66% OR THREE AND A QUARTER BILLION DOLLARS. OF THE NATION'S ANNUALIZED EARTHQUAKE LOSSES ARE IN CALIFORNIA. BY COMPARISON ALASKA'S ANNUALIZED EARTHQUAKE LOSSES AMOUNT TO FORTY MILLION DOLLARS WHICH IS LESS THAN THE LOSSES SUFFERED BY CALIFORNIANS IN THE NINETEEN NINETY FOUR NORTHRIDGE EARTHQUAKE. ABOUT TWO AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS OF CALIFORNIA'S ANNUALIZED EARTHQUAKE LOSSES. ARE CONCENTRATED IN THE GREATER SAN FRANCISCO LOS ANGELES ORANGE COUNTY AND SAN WERE TO DO YOU KNOW COUNTY AREAS. OVER THE PAST TWO HUNDRED YEARS CALIFORNIA HAS EXPERIENCED SEVENTY SEVEN EARTHQUAKES EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN THE MAGNITUDE SIX WHICH IS A DAMAGING LEVEL. LOOKED AT MORE CLOSELY -- THAT BREAKS DOWN TO A DESTRUCTIVE MAGNITUDE SIX EARTHQUAKE EVERY TWO POINT EIGHT YEARS AND A MAGNITUDE SEVEN EARTHQUAKE EVERY ELEVEN YEARS. ACCORDING TO THE UNIFORM CALIFORNIA EARTHQUAKE RUPTURE FORECAST THERE'S A 93% CHANCE OF A MAGNITUDE SIX POINT SEVEN NORTHRIDGE INTENSITY EARTHQUAKE OCCURRING IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND A 97% CHANCE OF THAT MAGNITUDE OCCURRING IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IN THE NEXT THIRTY YEARS. TO DATE THE CALIFORNIA GEOLOGICAL SURVEY HAS PLACED ZONES AROUND FIVE THOUSAND MILES OF ACTIVE SERVICE FAULTS AFFECTING THIRTY SIX COUNTIES AND ONE HUNDRED FIVE CITIES. FAR MORE THAN ANY OTHER STATE. THESE ACTIVE FAULTS AFFECT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF BUILDINGS. IF CALIFORNIA WHICH OPERATES THE WORLD'S FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY AND EMPLOYEES AND SERVICES NEARLY FORTY MILLION INHABITANTS IS TO MAINTAIN AND GROW THAT LEADERSHIP. THAN CALIFORNIA WILL NEED TO TAKE DECISIVE STEPS TO ENSURE THAT THE RESILIENCY FROM THESE EARTHQUAKE EVENTS. WE THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER NECESSARY IN FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE AND RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. LET ME ASK IF THERE ARE OTHER SUPPORTERS. IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION. HIS OUR SECOND. I WANT TO THANK MISTER NAZARIAN FOR BEING REALLY I THINK IN OUR LEGISLATURE THE CHAMPION FOR SEISMIC SAFETY AND EARTHQUAKE PREPAREDNESS AND VERY MUCH.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I REALLY APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE AND THE CHAIR WORKING WITH ME AND MY STOP ON THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION -- THIS BILL IS INTENDED TO HELP SPUR THE CREATION OF EIGHTY USE ACROSS THE STATE IN PARTICULARLY EIGHTY USE AS A SOLUTION TO THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS -- A FINANCING INCENTIVES CAN BE USED TO PROMOTE AFFORDABILITY AND EIGHTY USE APPROACH FOR OWNERS TO CONSTRUCT AND FOR TENANTS ON AN ONGOING BASIS. FOR EXAMPLE AT NAPA COUNTY OFFERS LOW COST LOANS TO HOMEOWNERS TO CONSTRUCT EIGHTY USE WHICH ARE THEN DEED RESTRICTED TO BE AFFORDABLE TO LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. NON GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES SUCH AS THE HOUSING TRUST OF SILICON VALLEY HAVE SIMILAR PROGRAMS. IN LOS ANGELES THE CITY AND COUNTY ARE WORKING TO CREATE INCENTIVES FOR HOMEOWNERS SO THAT EIGHTY USE CAN BE MORE QUICKLY BUILT THROUGH SUBSIDIES TO THE HOMEOWNERS WERE WILLING. TO RENT THEIR UNITS TO HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS OR SECTION EIGHT VOUCHER RECIPIENTS. A LOT OF TIMES THE CREATION OF EIGHTY USE AS A REAL WIN WIN FOR THE COMMUNITY BECAUSE OF THE THESE UNITS CAN BE CREATED AT A MUCH LOWER COSTS THAN TRADITIONAL AFFORDABLE HOUSING. WHICH IN LOS ANGELES CAN BE SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A UNIT AND EIGHTY USE OF COURSE COST A LOT LESS AND THEN YOU HAVE THE PRIVATE HOMEOWNERS ALSO CONTRIBUTING. AB SIX SEVENTY ONE REQUIRES A LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO INCLUDE A PLAN IN THEIR HOUSING ELEMENT TO INCENTIVIZE AND PROMOTE THE CREATION OF EIGHTY USE THAT CAN BE OFFERED AS A PORTABLE RENT FOR VERY LOW LOW AND MODERATE INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. THE BILL REQUIRES THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT TO DEVELOP A LIST OF EXISTING STATE GRANT AND FINANCIAL INCENTIVES TO PROMOTE PLANNING CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATION OF EIGHTY USE. AT AFFORDABLE RAMPS AND POSTED ON THE DEPARTMENT'S WEBSITE. SB SIX SEVENTY ONE CREATES A WORKABLE RESOURCE FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF AFFORDABLE EIGHTY USE OR THE HOMEOWNER LOCAL AND STATE. WITH ME TO SPEAK TODAY IN SUPPORT IS DEBORAH CARLTON WITH THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION AND I REQUEST FULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. MR HOUGHTON I THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU KNOW YOU JUST SAID IT ALL IT. I THINK WILL WIN THE LAST PIECES HERE BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON EIGHTY USE FOR THE LAST DECADE OR SO WHEN WE'VE SEEN IN HUGE INCREASE IN PERMITS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL -- ALMOST TWO THOUSAND IN LOS ANGELES -- OVER A HUNDRED IN OAKLAND AND THIS IS JUST IN THE LAST YEAR SINCE WE'VE REALLY INCREASE THE INCENTIVES FOR A TO USE. THIS BILL WILL PUT I THINK ONE OF THE AN IMPORTANT PIECE INTO LAW AND THAT'S THE INCENTIVE PIECE ESPECIALLY ON THE FINANCING SIDE. AND THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION FINDS THIS TO BE ONE OF THE MOST CREATIVE AND COST EFFECTIVE SOLUTIONS TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS. WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU LET ME ASK IF THERE ARE OTHER SUPPORTERS OF THE BILL. GOOD MORNING NUMBERS JENNIFER SPEC COME OUT OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS WE HAVE A SUPPORT OF AMENDED POSITION ON THE BILL WE SUPPORT THE GOALS OF APPELLANTS AND INCENTIVIZING EIGHTY YOU DEVELOPMENT.

THE PROGRAM PROVIDES FUNDING TO SUPPORT HIGHER DENSITY DEVELOPMENT THAT WAS AND A HALF MILE OF MAJOR TRANSIT STOPS AND A QUARTER MILE A BUS SERVICE ON LAND THAT IS KNOWN FOR MULTI FAMILY HOUSING. CITIES COULD DECIDE TO USE THIS PROGRAM SO THIS IS AN OPT IN PROGRAM IT'S NOT FORCING LOCALITIES. TO BE INVOLVED IT WOULD ALL AND IT WOULD DESIGNATE AREAS TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS FINANCIAL SUPPORT. TO DETERMINE IF A PROJECT IS ELIGIBLE THE PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT MUST BE INSIDE THE CITY CITY DESIGNATED PROGRAM AREA. AND AT LEAST TWO THIRDS OF THE LOCAL OF THE TOTAL SQUARE FOOTAGE MUST BE MULTI FAMILY. THESE DEVELOPMENTS MUST ALSO PROVIDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS BASED ON THE SET ASIDE REQUIREMENTS OF THE PROGRAM. INDIVIDUAL DEVELOPMENTS WOULD RECEIVE FINANCIAL SUPPORT IN THE FORM OF A BOND FROM CALIFORNIA HOUSING FINANCE AUTHORITY IN EXCHANGE FOR PROVIDING HIGH DENSITY DEVELOPMENT WITH INCOME RESTRICTIVE UNITS FOR FIFTY FIVE YEARS.

CITIES WOULD HAVE THE OPTION TO USE THIS TAX INCREMENT TOOL TO PROVIDE THE GAP FINANCING NECESSARY TO MAKE THE CONSTRUCTION OF AFFORDABLE HOMES POSSIBLE. THIS TOOLS DESIGNED IS GIVE CITIES TREMENDOUS FLEXIBILITY TO PROVIDE A MORE OR LESS ASSISTANCE BASED ON A PROJECT DEPENDING UPON THE LEVEL OF AFFORDABILITY SUITED FOR A PARTICULAR NEIGHBORHOOD. LARGE CITIES SUCH AS LOS ANGELES OR SAN FRANCISCO COULD UNDERWRITE THE PROJECTS ON THEIR OWN OR SIT SMALLER CITIES COULD PARTNER WITH CAL HFA WHO COULD ACT AS A CONDUIT LENDER. AB SEVENTEEN SEVENTEEN OFFERS TREMENDOUS PUBLIC BENEFITS IT EXPANDS THE SUPPLY OF LOWER COST HOMES IN AREAS WHERE ONLY MARKET RATE UNITS ARE TRADITIONALLY BUILT SECOND IT REDUCES THE NEED FOR MORE BUILDABLE LAND BY PROMOTING DENSITY.

FOR EVERY ONE THOUSAND HOMES BUILT. THANK YOU AND WE STRONG ONLY ENCOURAGE AN AYE VOTE. OTHER WITNESSES. BUT LUIS MANTE FROM CALIFORNIA BE -- I THINK THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER IN THE AUTHOR DID A GREAT JOB COVERING THE BILL I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT CREATIVE -- HOUSING -- LEGISLATION LIKE IT'S SUCH AS THIS ARE ESSENTIAL FOR MEETING THE STATE'S -- CHRONICLES AND HOUSING AFFORDABILITY GOALS AND URGENT ABOUT. LET ME ASK IF THERE ARE OTHER SUPPORTERS OF THIS BILL. JENNIFER SPEC ABOUT CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS AND SUPPORT. ALORS TALK ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. ALEX STORES ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF VETERANS SERVICE AGENCIES IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. TODD DAVID ON BEHALF OF THE BAY AREA HOUSING ADVOCACY COALITION SUPPORT. MATT REAGAN FROM THE BAY AREA COUNCIL IN SUPPORT. LET ME ASK IF THERE IS ANY OPPOSITION. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS COME MORNING DAVID WILL FOR THE HOWARD JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION WE ARE OPPOSED TO MISTER CHAIRMAN I DO APOLOGIZE FOR THE WEIGHT WATER ON THE SPELL BUT THE LETTERS NOT WITHOUT PRECEDENT. WE DID OPPOSE THE AUTHORS AB TWENTY FIVE FIFTY THREE LAST YEAR WHICH IS SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO THE BILL THAT'S BEFORE US TODAY SO. AGAIN MY APOLOGIES -- LISTEN MEMBERS WE DO HAVE AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROBLEM THERE'S ONE THIRD OF CALIFORNIA RUNNERS THAT SPEND AT LEAST HALF THEIR TAKE HOME PAY ON RENT. WE NEED TO BUILD A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND UNITS OF NEW HOUSING A YEAR JUST TO KEEP PACE WITH DEMAND BUT INSTEAD WE DON'T ABOUT HALF THAT OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS THERE'S ONLY THEN FOUR YEARS AGO WE BUILT A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND UNITS OF NEW HOUSING. SO IT IS ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THAT WE DO NEED MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUT UNFORTUNATELY AND THIS IS A LONG STANDING PRECEDENT FOR THE HOWARD JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION ANYTIME YOU'RE DEALING WITH LONG TERM. DEBT INCLUDING -- LONG TERM DEVELOPMENT ENTITIES WHICH IS WHAT THIS BILL WOULD ESTABLISH WE DO BELIEVE YOU SHOULD HAVE A TWO THIRDS VOTE BEFORE I DEBT IS APPROVED TO ESTABLISH A REDEVELOPMENT ENTITY AND BUILD NEW AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE'VE ALWAYS BELIEVE THAT AND CONTINUE TO THINK THAT'S TRUE HERE I MEAN THIS IS. THAT IT'S GOING TO BE ON THE BOOKS LONG AFTER THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS THAT APPROVED BETTER OUT OF OFFICE -- AND IS NOT GEO DEBT YOU KNOW SO IT'S NOT NECESSARILY BACKED BY THE FULL FAITH AND CREDIT OF A LOCAL MUNICIPALITY SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE DO THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE THE SAFEGUARD OF OUR APPROVAL SO IT ASK FOR NOVA. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THE WISH TO OPPOSE THIS BILL. LET'S BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY DISCUSSION. WHAT SAY THE AUTHOR I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS CONCEPT FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS AND VERY MUCH APPRECIATE? YOUR WORK IN THE WORK OF YOUR SPONSORS WITH OUR COMMITTEE -- I DO THINK THAT THIS IS VERY MUCH WITH YOUR AUTHOR AMENDMENTS A CREATIVE WAY AND HOW WE CAN HELP FUNDS MULTI FAMILY HOUSING -- AND WITH THE AMENDMENTS TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE TIGHTENING UP AFFORDABLE HOUSING COMPONENT SO WITH THAT HAPPY TO SUPPORT IT TODAY. AND UNLESS THERE'S ANY. ADDITIONAL COMMENT. DO YOU WANT. TO CLOSE I WOULD JUST RESPOND TO THE GENTLEMAN FROM HER JERVIS -- BRIEFLY -- TOTALLY UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN I WILL SAY THAT WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS SUCH AS THIS YOU'RE TAKING LAND THAT. IS UNDER DEVELOPED AND WHEN YOU DO THESE PROJECTS YOU RAISE THE AMOUNT OF TAXABLE REVENUE SO EVEN THOUGH THAT REVENUE IS USED FOR A WHILE TO PAY BACK THAT BOND EVENTUALLY YOU HAVE AN ASSET THAT GENERATES MUCH MORE REVENUE. FOR THE FOR THE MUNICIPALITY AND THAT'S CERTAINLY BEEN MY EXPERIENCE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT SO THAT MONEY YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT INVESTING IT IN SOME STOCK SOMEWHERE YOU'RE ACTUALLY BUILDING SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A GOOD RETURN ON THAT MONEY SO -- I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN BUT I THINK IT'S A VERY PRUDENT USE OF PUBLIC MONEY BECAUSE AND YOU ALSO HAVE THE BENEFIT ON LIKE WITH A INVESTMENT A SHOPPING MALL YOU HAVE THE BENEFIT OF OF HOUSING YOUR COMMUNITY. SO I THINK IT'S A VERY SMART USE FOR COMMUNITIES WHO WANT TO USE THIS TOOL. AND WITH THAT THANK YOU FOR YOUR CLOTHES IS OUR MOTION ABOUT THE SPORT [inaudible] THEIR SECOND. I WILL SECOND IT OF MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. MOTION IS TO PASTOR OF THE COMEDIAN LOCAL GOVERNMENT CHIU HI CHIU I GAVE. AT FORTY GABRIELLE GABRIEL I GLORIA [inaudible] KILEY. KILEY NO. LEE MON REMOTE I MAIENSCHEIN. QUIRK SILVA. QUIRK SILVA AYE.

AND WITH THAT WE HAVE TO MORE AUTHORS MYSELF MR GABRIEL I WILL ASK MR GABRIEL IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT YOUR ITEM. FILE ITEM FIFTEEN AB FIFTEEN SEVENTY NINE PLEASE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I AM PLEASED TODAY 2% EIGHTY FIFTEEN SEVENTY NINE A BILL TO ADDRESS OUR STATE'S CRIPPLING SHORTAGE OF STUDENT HOUSING. AS THIS COMMITTEE IS WELL AWARE COLLEGE STUDENTS ARE AT THE FOREFRONT OF OUR STATE'S HOUSING CRISIS ACCORDING TO RECENT DATA. STUDENTS HAVE ENTERED HOMELESSNESS IN THE LAST YEAR AND ALMOST 60% HAVE FACED HOUSING IN SECURITY. CSU AND YOU SEE STUDENTS ALSO REPORT ALARMINGLY HIGH RATES OF HOMELESSNESS AND HOUSING AND SECURITY. AB FIFTEEN SEVENTY NINE SIX TO ADDRESS THIS CHALLENGE BY ELIMINATING IMPACT FEES WITH KNOWN ACCESS THAT CAN SLOW DOWN DEVELOPMENT AND DRIVE UP THE COST OF NEW STUDENT HOUSING. AB FIFTEEN SEVENTY NINE SEEKS TO ENSURE THAT KATE TO THROUGH TWELVE STUDENTS SCHOOL IMPACT MITIGATION FEES CANNOT BE USED TO DELAY THE CONSTRUCTION OF COLLEGE HOUSING OR INCREASED COSTS SINCE ABSENT RARE EXCEPTIONS. DORM LIKE APARTMENTS DO NOT HOUSE K. THROUGH TWELVE STUDENTS. IN SO DOING THIS MEASURE WOULD ENSURE THAT STUDENT HOUSING IS TREATED SIMILAR TO SENIOR HOUSING WHERE DEVELOPERS ARE EXEMPTED FROM PAYING IMPACT MITIGATION FEES. THAT HAVING BEEN SAID THIS BILL RECOGNIZES THAT THERE MIGHT BE A RARE EXCEPTION TO THE RULE SUCH AS A YOUNG STUDENT COUPLE WITH A CHILD. IN THIS REQUIRES OWNERS TO PAY THE APPROPRIATE FEE FOR EACH K. TO TWELVE STUDENT THAT ACTUALLY RESIDES IN THEIR DEVELOPMENT. WITH ME TODAY TO TO TESTIFY ARE TWO EXPERTS ON THE ISSUE -- SYLVIA FERRARI WITH AM CAL A STUDENT AND AFFORDING HOUSING AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPER AND ALICIA HACKER A YOU SEE DAVID STUDENT A UC DAVIS STUDENT FROM ASSEMBLY DISTRICT. FORTY FIVE THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE YOUR WITNESSES. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY MY NAME'S LISA HOCKER AND I'M A SECOND YEAR POLITICAL SCIENCE PUBLIC SERVICE MAJOR FROM UC DAVIS AND I'M HERE TODAY TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF AB. FIFTEEN SEVENTY NINE AND PROVIDE A STUDENT PERSPECTIVE ON THE GROWING HOUSING CRISIS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. JUST A TWENTY MINUTE DRIVE FROM HERE IS THE CITY OF DAVIS A SMALL COLLEGE TOWN THAT'S HOME TO THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS JUST LIKE ME. FOR PASSION ABOUT STUDIES AND WORKING TOWARDS MAKING THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE ONE RELATIVELY HAD IN FACT ABOUT THIS COLLEGE TOWN IS THE HIGH AMOUNT OF HOUSING AND SECURITY THAT TOUCHES NEARLY EVERY STUDENT'S LIFE. ACCORDING TO THE UC DAVIS HOUSING STUDY ABOUT 7% OR CLOSE TO IT TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED STUDENTS HAVE REPORTED EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS FOR SOME PERIOD ABOUT UC DAVIS. A FURTHER 18% OR ABOUT SIX THOUSAND STUDENTS HAVE REPORTED BEING HOUSING AND SECURE FOR SOME PERIOD. NOT KNOWING WHERE YOU GONNA BE ABLE TO SLEEP AT NIGHT OR FEEL HAVE A REPORT OVER YOUR HEAD OR HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN PAYING RENT OR HAVING A GOOD MEAL OR BUYING YOUR BOOKS. FOR YOUR CLASS IMPAIRS A STUDENT'S ABILITY TO SUCCEED IN COLLEGE AB FIFTEEN SEVENTY NINE ENCOURAGES THE DEVELOPMENT OF MORE STUDENT HOUSING AND WILL SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE THE DAILY LIVES OF STUDENTS. AND ALLOW STUDENTS THE FREEDOM TO STUDY COMPLETE THEIR DEGREE WITHOUT THE FEAR OF NOT HAVING A PLACE TO SLEEP AT NIGHT BUT THAT I WANT TO THANK YOU AND ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. FOR EIGHTY FIFTEEN SEVENTY NINE GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBER SILVIO FERRARI HERE ON BEHALF OF AN CAL SO AM CAL HAS BEEN AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUILDER FOR ABOUT THE LAST FORTY YEARS. ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO AND CAL KIND OF TOOK A STEP BACK FOR A MINUTE AND SAID LISTEN WE'VE GOT A GREAT DEAL OF EXPERTISE IN THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING WORLD HOW CAN WE TAKE THIS EXPERTISE. AND APPLY IT TO OTHER AREAS WHERE THERE'S A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF NEED. AND OUT OF THAT STUDY OUT OF THAT REFLECTION WHAT THEY REALLY DISCOVERED IS THAT AS YOU JUST HEARD THERE ARE FAR TOO MANY COLLEGE KIDS THAT ARE PURSUING. COLLEGE EDUCATION AT TRINA THE DREAM OF RECEIVING THAT DIPLOMA AND THEY ARE FACING HOMELESSNESS THEY'RE FACING HOUSING AND SECURITY. SO WHAT WAS BORN OUT OF THAT WAS A PRODUCT THAT I AM CAL HAS BEEN REFERRING TO IS PURPOSE BUILT STUDENT HOUSING. IN FORM AND FUNCTION IN EVERY WAY IT LOOKS JUST LIKE ON CAMPUS DORMS. IT IS A SINGLE KITCHEN SINGLE COMMUNAL -- COMMUNAL LIVING ROOM AND IS SURROUNDED BY INDIVIDUAL ROOMS THAT ARE EACH INDIVIDUALLY RENTED EACH INDIVIDUALLY LOCKED. THEY THEN PARTNER UP WITH THE COLLEGE OR THE UNIVERSITY AND THE ADVERTISED THE PRODUCT ADVERTISE IT TO THE STUDENTS -- AND THEY TRY TO WORK WITH THE COLLEGE TO GET IT LISTED AS OVERFLOW FOR THOSE WHO CANNOT SECURE ON CAMPUS HOUSING. UP PURPOSE BUILT HOUSING IS NOT DESIGNED FOR FAMILIES IT'S NOT CONDUCIVE FOR FAMILIES THAT'S THAT'S WHY IN THE FIVE TO SIX PROJECTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY BUILT. NO FAMILY HAS REQUESTED TO LIVE IN ANY OF THE SITUATIONS NOR DO WE EXPECT THEM EVER TO IN THE FUTURE. SO WE BELIEVE THAT -- THIS IS A RIGHT BALANCE TO SAY -- THERE NEEDS TO BE AN UNDERSTANDING THAT WE ARE NOT GENERATING STUDENTS BUT AGAIN AS THE AUTHOR MENTION IF THEIR CASE EVER COMES ALONG. THERE IS A MECHANISM IN THIS THAT WILL MAKE SURE THAT NO DISTRICT -- IT DOES NOT RECEIVE WHAT THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY DO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME OR CHINA. THANK YOU LET ME ASK IF THERE ARE OTHER SUPPORTERS OF THE BILL. MARINO WHITE WITH THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING CONSORTIUM IN SUPPORT. LOSE MONDAY WITH CALIFORNIA'S SPORT. GALLERY SPOKE ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION AND SUPPORT. PATRICK SAY WELL AS WITH THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL FOR FOR WILL HOUSING IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. LET ME ASK IF THERE'S ANY OPPOSITION. BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS. THAT'S WHAT I THINK THERE'S A MOTION WITH THE BILLS ARE SECOND I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR MOVING THIS FOR I THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO EXEMPT. FROM SCHOOL DISTRICT FEES HOUSING FOR STUDENTS -- AND WITH THE EXCEPTIONS THAT YOU'VE CREATED HERE I KNOW THIS BILL'S GOING TO GO ON TO THE EDUCATION COMMITTEE WHERE SCHOOLS CAN WAY ON THE EDUCATION POLICY ANGLE BUT I THINK FROM A HOUSING POLICY ANGLE. THIS MAKES SENSE WE ASK IF YOU HAVE ANY ITEMS YOU LIKE TO SAY IN YOUR CLOTHES THE SHADED I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE. SECRETARY MOTION TO PASSED TO THE COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION TWO FIVE TWO HI DAVE. HI I GLORIA KILEY. KILEY I IN THE MONTH. THE MONTH I MAIENSCHEIN. QUIRK SILVA HI QUIRK SILVA I GET REAL HIGH EVERY ALLY. EVEN EFFORTS TO GET OUT OF COMMITTEE WILL WAIT FOR OTHER MEMBERS TO ADD ON COLLEGE WE HAVE THREE FINAL ITEMS IN THE ARE MY BILLS SO I'M GOING TO TURN THE GAVEL OVER TO OUR VICE CHAIR [inaudible] START. OKAY WE'LL START WITH THE FILE ITEM ONE A. B. -- ELEVEN CHAIRMAN FOR SERVERS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR COLLEAGUES AB ELEVEN WOULD RECREATE REDEVELOPMENT AS A TOOL TO FUND CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING. WHILE FORMER REDEVELOPMENT DEFINITELY HAD ITS CHALLENGES WITH REGARDS TO TYPICALLY BETWEEN FOUR TO FIVE BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT THE ELIMINATION OF REDEVELOPMENT ALSO BECAUSE OUR STATE TO STOP INVESTING ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING AS WELL AS CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE. WITH THIS BILL WE ARE NOT PROPOSING BRING BACK THE ECONOMIC INVESTMENTS FROM REDEVELOPMENT ONE POINT -- BUT WE ARE ONLY FOCUSED ON HOUSING AND INFRASTRUCTURE ON A SMALLER SCALE THAN FORMER REDEVELOPMENT. OUR BILL WOULD ALLOW CITIES AND COUNTIES TO CREATE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND INFRASTRUCTURE AGENCIES REQUIRING AT LEAST 30% OF THE MONEY GENERATED IN PROJECT AREAS TO FIND HOUSING. TO AVOID ABUSES FROM THE PASTOR BILL HAS MANY SAFEGUARDS REQUIREMENTS OF DETAILED RECORDS AN INDEPENDENT AUDITS FINES FOR VIOLATIONS NEW GOVERNANCE PROVISIONS AND ROBUST REPLACEMENT AND ANTI DISPLACEMENT POLICIES. WHILE OUR STATE CONSTITUTION REQUIRES ALL TAXING ENTITIES ARE RECEIVED PROPERTY TAXES A CITY A COUNTY OR SPECIAL DISTRICT TO PARTICIPATE THE INTENT OF OUR BILL HAS BEEN TO MAKE COUNTY SPECIAL DISTRICTS AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS HOLE. THROUGH PASTORS I'VE ACCEPTED AMENDMENTS SUGGESTED BY THE COUNTY SPECIAL DISTRICTS AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO MAKE CLEAR THAT THEIR PROPERTY TAX ALLOCATION WILL NOT BE IMPACTED BY THE CREATION. OF AN AREA IN THIS BILL THE TOTAL AMOUNT THE STATE WOULD HAVE TO CONTRIBUTE TO BACK FILL SCHOOLS WOULD ALSO BE CAPPED. THIS BILL IS A COMMON SENSE APPROACH TO REESTABLISH. REDEVELOPMENT ON A LIMITED SCALE FOCUSED ON OUR STATE CURRENT PRIORITIES AND WITH SIGNIFICANT STATE OVERSIGHT WANT TO THANK ALL THE MANY JOINT AUTHORS OF THIS BILL. AND AT THIS POINT TURN IT OVER TO OUR WITNESS. GOOD MORNING REBEKAH MARKETS REPRESENTING LEADING H. CALIFORNIA LEADING AGE CALIFORNIA REPRESENTS NONPROFIT PROVIDERS OF SENIOR CARE AND SERVICES INCLUDING AFFORDABLE SENIOR HOUSING DEVELOPERS AND MANAGERS. COLLECTIVELY OUR MEMBERS SERVE OVER ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND OLDER ADULTS ACROSS THE STATE. THE DISSOLUTION OF REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES IS MADE IT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO FINANCE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND PARTICULARLY HOUSING THAT IS AFFORDABLE TO THOSE WERE EXTREMELY AND VERY LOW INCOME. THE STATE'S LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND HIGHER COST OF LIVING IS FORCED MANY OLDER ADULTS TO LIVE ON FIXING TOWN INCOMES AND TO POVERTY AND HOMELESSNESS. AS HOUSING COSTS RISE RETIREMENT INCOME SUCH AS SOCIAL SECURITY AND SSI HAVE REMAINED STAGNANT AND MANY LOW INCOME OLDER ADULTS FIND IMPOSSIBLE PAY THEIR RENT. MORE THAN HALF OF THE PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS IN CALIFORNIA OR OLDER ADULTS LOS ANGELES COUNTY RECENTLY DISCOVERED THAT WHILE THEIR OVERALL HOMELESS POPULATION WENT DOWN 4% AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE NUMBER OF HOMELESS PERSONS AGE SIXTY TWO AND OVER INCREASED 22% IN THE SAME PERIOD. THE AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD INCOME OF RESIDENTS LIVING IN LEADING H. CALIFORNIA MEMBER AFFORDABLE SENIOR HOUSING COMMUNITY STATEWIDE. IS UNDER FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS PER MONTH MOST OF THE BUILDINGS THAT SERVER THEY USE EXTREMELY AND VERY LOW INCOME OLDER ADULTS% WERE BUILT USING REDEVELOPMENT FUNDING. DESPITE NOBLE EFFORTS BY THE LEGISLATURE AND HOUSING ADVOCATES TO CREATE NEW SOURCES OF FUNDING FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FILL THE ONE BILLION DOLLAR A YEAR HOLE LEFT IN THE ABSENCE OF REDEVELOPMENT. THE OLD REDEVELOPMENT PROGRAM HAD ITS FLAWS BUT IT'S UNDENIABLE THAT THE PROGRAM WAS VERY SUCCESSFUL AT PRODUCING AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AB ELEVEN SIX TO REIMAGINE WHAT WORKED FROM THE PRIOR REDEVELOPMENT PROGRAM ALL AIMING TO FIX WHAT DIDN'T WE APPLAUD ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU AND IS CO AUTHORS FOR THEIR LEADERSHIP. ON THIS ISSUE AND WE URGE LIVE OUT. DO WE HAVE ANY -- SUPPORTER. FOR THIS BILL. JENNIFER SPOKE ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS IN SUPPORT. AT A REGULAR IN BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WE HAVE A SUPPORT IF AMENDED. SORRY WE'RE LATE TO ENGAGING. THAT 30% SET ASIDE TAX RATES 10% HIGHER THAN THE FORMER RATE UNDER THE THE DISSOLVED RT A AND WE PREFER TO BE AT THE 20% LEVEL. THE OTHER ISSUES THERE'S CLEAR IT THERE NEEDS TO BE CLARITY AROUND THE PROVISION ABOUT -- AGENCIES PROMOTING GHG CLIMATE POLICIES I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME CLARIFICATION ON THAT AND THEN WE BELIEVE THERE SHOULD BE A PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION BASED ON CONTRIBUTIONS FOR THE GOVERNING BOARD THANKS. HIS NAME AN ORGANIZATION PLEASE. CAPTION RACY TECH EQUITY COLLABORATIVE IN SUPPORT. BRING A WHITE WITH A CALIFORNIA HOUSING CONSORTIUM SUPPORTIVE OF THE CONCEPT OF BRINGING BACK A MORE ROBUST TAX INCREMENT FINANCING TOOL.

THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THERE'S NO ONE ELSE -- IS THEIR OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL -- NONE OPPOSITION SORRY HERE LATE FOR US SUPPORT CONCEPT HOUSING CALIFORNIA TYRONE BUCKLEY THANK YOU. THANK YOU [inaudible] ANYONE ELSE. SEEING NONE OF THOSE IN OPPOSITION. PLEASE TAKE A SEAT. GOOD MORNING A MISTER SHERMAN MEMBERS -- I'M BOB NAYLOR I REPRESENT FEELS STEAD AND COMPANY. WHO SUPPORTED THE GOVERNOR BROWN -- BROWN AND THE TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN EVER TO DISSOLVE REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES FIRST WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR HIS -- STEADFAST EFFORTS TO ADDRESS THE HOUSING CRISIS. BUT WITH ALL RESPECT -- RETURNING TO THE REDEVELOPMENT MODEL HAS IS VERY PROBLEMATIC FIRST REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES WERE NOT VERY EFFICIENT AT SPENDING THEIR HOUSING MONEY. OF THE CALIFORNIA BUDGET PROJECT IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN FOUND THAT ONLY 11% OF THE MONEY WAS SPENT ON ACTUAL HOUSING CONSTRUCTION 31% ON DEBT SERVICE AND SO ON THE LA -- FOUND THAT REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES HAD TWO AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS OF UNSPENT HOUSING MONEY -- ON HAND AT THE TIME OF THEIR DISSOLUTION -- THEY ALSO TENDED TO USE EMINENT DOMAIN -- TO TAKE PROPERTIES AND THEN LEAVE THOSE PROPERTIES -- AN USED FOR YEARS AND YEARS ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS LOOK AT DOWNTOWN SACRAMENTO ON CASE STREET TO SEE. THE RESULTS OF FORTY YEARS OF VACANT PROPERTY -- THE REDEVELOPMENT MODEL IS REQUIRES BONDING AGAINST FUTURE PROPERTY TAX INCREMENT. WITH THAT THAT IS A HIGH RISK BUDGET STRATEGY BECAUSE IT DEDICATES IT REQUIRES THE STATE ESSENTIALLY TO BACK FILL THE SCHOOL REVENUES FOR THIRTY OR FORTY YEARS. AND THIS IS BY THE WAY AND ONLY ON HOUSING. FROM A CITY STANDPOINT WALLING OFF THAT REVENUE TO PAY FOR THE BOND DOES SERVICE MEANS. THEY ARE RESTRICTED AND ADDRESSING THE INCREASING PENSION COSTS AND NEED FOR FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AND ADDRESSING THE HOMELESS PROBLEM. OF THE GOVERNOR IN HIS BUDGET CHOSE A DIFFERENT WAY THAN THE REDEVELOPMNT MODEL AND WE THINK THE GOVERNOR HAS A BETTER WAY RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NOVA. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS COME MORNING DAVID WOLF THE HOWARD JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION OPPOSITION TO THE BILL AND FRANKLY -- MISTER CHAIR I JUST CONCUR WITH THE ARGUMENTS OF MR NAY ARE -- LONG TERM DEBT DOES NEED VOTER APPROVAL -- AS I TALKED ABOUT EARLIER THIS MORNING AND ALSO OTHER SHOULD BE EMINENT DOMAIN PROTECTIONS -- TO ENSURE THAT PRIVATE PROPERTY ISN'T TAKEN FOR PRIVATE USE THEM BECAUSE THOSE THINGS ARE NOT IN THIS BILL WOULD ASK FOR AN OF ART ALSO. DO WE HAVE ANYONE IN THE AUDIENCE -- THAT'S ALSO. IN OPPOSITION THIS BILL SCHNEEMANN ORGANIZATION. FOR MR MY APOLOGIES I MISS THE SUPPORT SEGMENT NANCY TRIED AS A SPIN OFF SITE ON BEHALF OF THE COALITION FOR ADEQUATE SCHOOL HOUSING WE HAD RAISING CONCERNS EARLIER ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THIS BILL COULD HAVE ON EDUCATION FUNDING AND WE JUST WANT TO SAY THAT THOSE. CONCERNS ARE REMOVED WITH THE AMENDMENTS OF THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN DAN CARRIED AWAY. FROM WILL BE THE CALIFORNIA CITY SORT OF IN THE SAME CATEGORY LÃ  OF LATE LATE TO THE TO THE SUPPORT -- COLUMN. WE ARE BOTH THINK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING FOR THIS BILL IT'S A RECOGNITION THAT IN ORDER TO GET BACK TO SOME OF THE TYPES OF PROJECTS THAT. MEMBERS IN THIS BUILDING WANT TO SEE MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING WERE TRANSFERRING DEVELOPMENT. YOU'RE GONNA NEED A MORE POWERFUL TOOL THAT THEN THE ONES THAT ARE THERE TODAY -- WE DO HAVE SOME SOME TECHNICAL ISSUES WITH THE BILL AND CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR ON THOSE BUT WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR FOR FOR BRINGING THE IDEA FORWARD BECAUSE IT'S PART OF THE REALITY OF OF ACTUALLY GETTING GETTING US BACK TO A MORE WORKABLE TOOL. THANK YOU. ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. HEARING NONE ANY -- DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. IT'S A KILEY. GOOD MORNING SIR TO AYE YOU MENTIONED SOMETHING IN YOUR REMARKS ABOUT HOW THIS -- BILL -- WILL NOT PROVIDE IS BROUGHT TO MANDATE -- FOR ECONOMIC REDEVELOPMENT IS THE PRIOR -- WE DON'T WE JUST COULD YOU EXPLAIN THAT LITTLE MORE WHAT THAT DISTINCTION IS ABSOLUTELY AND THAT IS ENTIRELY TRUE SO LET'S JUST GO BACK TO WHAT REDEVELOPMENT USED TO BE. OUR STATE SPENT FIVE TO SIX BILLION DOLLARS ABOUT 80% OF THAT MONEY WENT TO ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND 20% THAT MONEY WAS SET ASIDE. FOR HOUSING AND INFRASTRUCTURE -- IT WAS THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PARTS OF IT THAT WERE REALLY -- WHAT WERE THE CRITICISMS AROUND ABUSE -- MONIES WERE SPENT TO BUILD STRIP MALLS TO BUILD MERMAID BARS IN SACRAMENTO EXCEPT TRUCK. AND I AM NOT PROPOSING THAT WE ARE BRINGING BACK TAX INCREMENT FINANCING TOOL TO DO ANY OF THAT WHAT I AM PROPOSING IS THE PORTION WITH REGARDS TO HOUSING AND INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WEEK GIVEN THIS CRISIS WE HAVE RIGHT NOW BOTH OF THOSE FRONTS. THAT'S WHAT TAX INCREMENT FINANCING SHOULD BE USED SO WE'RE ONLY TALKING ABOUT SAY THE BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR THAT WE HAVE LOST. AND GIVEN THE HOUSING CRISIS THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW -- I THINK ALL CITIES AND COUNTIES WOULD LOVE TO SEE THAT MONEY COME BACK SO I IT AND THE OTHER THING THAT I KNOW YOU UNDERSTAND ABOUT TAX INCREMENT FINANCING -- YOU KNOW THE HOPE IS THAT WE'RE GOING TO WE'RE GONNA USE THESE FUNDS AND PROPERTY TAX VALUES WILL GO UP SO IF WE DON'T MAKE AN INVESTMENT -- ZERO TIMES ZERO IS NOT GONNA LEAD TO ANY GROWTH -- ONE THING THAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT THIS BILL IS WE PUT IN MANY. SAFEGUARDS TO AVOID THE ABUSES OF THE PAST AND I DO UNDERSTAND GIVEN WHAT HAPPENED IN THE PAST THERE JUST A LOT OF CONCERNS THAT PEOPLE HAVE ABOUT WHAT WE DO IN THE FUTURE. WE DELIBERATELY PUT AND DETAILED RECORD RICKY RECORD KEEPING AN INDEPENDENT AUDIT REQUIREMENTS FINES FOR VIOLATIONS SIGNIFICANT GOVERNANCE PROVISIONS -- ROBUST PROVISIONS AROUND REPLACEMENT ANTI DISPLACEMENT TO REALLY ADDRESS WHAT HAPPENED IN THE PAST BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO OBVIOUSLY GO BACK. BUT MY PERSPECTIVE THE BABY DID GET THROWN OUT WITH THE BATH WATER AS I THINK YOU MAY KNOW FROM REDEVELOPMENT HISTORY -- THE INTENT TO WIN THE LEGISLATURE VOTED TO END ASPECTS OF REDEVELOPMENT WERE NOT ENDED THERE WAS ESSENTIALLY A STRIPPED DOWN VERSION REPLACEMENT BUT BECAUSE OF A LAWSUIT. EVERYTHING ENDED UP GETTING THROWN OUT AND WE ARE NOW IN THE PLACE THAT WE ARE AND SO OUR GOAL IS TO KEEP WHAT. WE NEED FROM SO CALLED REDEVELOPMENT ATTACKS AND COMMIT FINANCING BUT TO ENSURE THAT -- THAT THE EXCESSES OF THE PAST ARE NOT BROUGHT BACK. GOT AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE EFFORT TO TO TRY TO REIN IN SOME OF THE THE ABUSES THAT WE SAW. THAT YOU KNOW IT SAYS THAT 30% OF THE MONEY HERE'S TO BE SET ASIDE FOR LOW INCOME HOUSING SO WHERE WERE MY THE OTHER 70% WIND UP CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE WE TO FIND THAT VERY CAREFULLY WHATEVER YOU WOULD UNDERSTAND TO BE SORT OF INFRASTRUCTURE YOU NEED TO BUILD. AROUND HOUSING TO MAKE CHASE A COMMUNITY WORK THAT'S WHAT WE WOULD SET IT ASIDE FOR ONE THING I'LL JUST SAY ABOUT THAT NUMBER IT IS CERTAINLY TRUE THAT IN REDEVELOPMENT ONE POINT NO. THE NUMBER WAS 20% -- THERE'S ANOTHER BILL MOVING IN THE SENATE THAT SUGGESTING THAT NUMBER OUGHT TO BE 50% WE THOUGHT TO SORT OF STRIKE IT DOWN THE MIDDLE 30% 70%. I AM OPEN TO WHAT THAT NUMBER SHOULD BE BASED ON WHAT THE CONSENSUS OF THE BODY IS BUT WE CERTAINLY THINK GIVEN THE HOUSING CRISIS AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE CRISES THAT WE'RE IN RIGHT NOW. WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING MORE THAN WHAT WE ARE DOING. IT DOES THE BILL -- CONTAIN ANY OTHER CONSTRAINTS ON THE USE OF EMINENT DOMAIN I SUPPOSE WHAT YOU JUST SAID COULD BE CONSIDERED ONE CONSTRAINT IN TERMS OF THE TYPE OF PROJECTS WHERE THERE'S A THEIR SUBJECTS THAT WERE CONDEMNATION CAN BE. USED AS A TOOL BUT OTHER OTHER -- LIMITS -- IN THIS BILL THAT DIDN'T EXIST IN THE PREVIOUS REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES WE DON'T ADDRESS THAT IN OUR BILL -- WE'D BE IT JUST WASN'T A TOPIC WE THOUGHT WE NEEDED WHAT WE WE OUGHT TO ADDRESS IN THIS BILL WHAT I WILL SAY IS THERE ARE -- MANY CHALLENGES TO MOVING FORWARD WITH EMINENT DOMAIN THERE ARE. MANY HURDLES THAT A LOCAL JURISDICTION IS TO GO THROUGH BUT THAT WASN'T OR HAS NOT BEEN A FOCUS OF THIS BILL -- YEAH I'D ENCOURAGE THAT TO BE -- YOU KNOW SOME OF THE WE GIVE SOME ATTENTION TO BECAUSE I THINK THAT THERE WAS A TRACK RECORD OF IT BEING USED IN SOME WAYS THAT WERE -- PRETTY -- FOR BAD FOR PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS IN THE PAST -- IF FINAL QUESTION YOU KNOW -- THIS IN ANOTHER WAY ON THAT POINT WE DO HAVE PROVISIONS THERE WERE MANY TIMES WHEN EMINENT DOMAIN WAS USE THAT ENDED UP DISPLACING SENSITIVE AND VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. AND AND WITHOUT ANY SENSE OF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN OF THOSE COMMUNITIES AFTERWARDS AND WE DO HAVE PROVISIONS IN THE BILL TO DEAL WITH THAT. OKAY IT'S GOOD TO HEAR -- AND THERE'S A STATISTIC GOT MISTER NEVER MENTIONS FROM THE CALIFORNIA BUDGET PROJECT THAT ONLY ABOUT 11%. OF THE FUNDS I PREVIOUSLY WOULD IN THE ACTUAL CONSTRUCTION YOU HAVE ANY SENSE OF OF WHY THAT WAS SO LOW AND HOW THAT. IS BEING ADDRESSED HERE I THINK YOU JUST BE THE NUMBER I I THINK THAT'S CORRECT -- I DON'T DISPUTE THE NUMBER I THINK THE REALITY IS -- THE STATE AND WAS NOT IN THE HOUSING CRISIS THAT WE'RE IN NOW AND BOY IF WE COULD HAVE TWO AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS TO SPEND ON HOUSING I HAVE A FEELING OUR COLLEAGUES WOULD KNOW HOW TO USE IT. WE HAVE A OF MOTION AND ANY SECOND ON THE FLOOR ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I GUESS JUST HAVE -- ONE GERMAN IN IN YOUR OPENING REMARKS YOU HAD MENTIONED THAT -- YOU TO SOME AMENDMENTS AND THAT LISTED OF SOME OPPOSITIONS -- I'D. I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A FLOOD IF YOU DO YOU KNOW IF -- THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS IN THE THE CTA. ARE THEY STILL NEUTRAL IN THIS OR OR TO THE AMENDMENTS THAT YOU ACCEPTED DID I BRING HIM TO TO NEUTRALITY OR IT'S IT'S A GOOD QUESTION THERE THEY'RE NOT HERE I I DON'T KNOW. FOR SURE -- THE ISSUE THAT THEY HAD REYES WERE AROUND SPECIAL DISTRICTS AND MAKING SURE THAT WE WERE KEEPING THEM WHOLE AND THAT WAS THE INTENT OF THE MOMENT SO WE'VE TAKEN AT THE REQUEST OF THE COUNTY SPECIAL DISTRICTS IN SCHOOL DISTRICTS. THAT THEIR PROPERTY TAX ALLOCATION WOULD BE IMPACTED SO WE'VE TAKEN THOSE MOMENTS I DO HOPE IT GOES A LONG WAY TOWARD ADDRESSING THOSE CONCERNS BUT I JUST DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY ARE AT THIS POINT. THANK YOU SIR -- IN IN WITH THAT -- YOU MAY CLOSE. UP VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THIS CONVERSATION THIS HAS A AS AS WE ALL KNOW IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN THIS WAS A VERY DIFFICULT CONVERSATION I THINK THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF BUYER'S REMORSE -- BUT WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW -- TO TO USE A ROBUST TOOL TO BUILD A HOUSING AND INFRASTRUCTURE THAT ARE COMMUNITIES NEED I THINK ALL OF US KNOW THAT OUR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS -- HAVE BEEN ASKING FOR SOMETHING IN THIS AREA AND SORE HOPE IS THAT WE ARE BUILDING CONSENSUS ON WHAT THIS TAKES LOOK FOR TO FUTURE CONVERSATIONS ON WAYS THAT WE CAN KEEP IMPROVING THIS. BUT AT THIS POINT I CERTAINLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT IF YOU CAN. THANK YOU AND MOVE WITH THAT -- I I WOULD JUST SAY THE CROW. WHERE WHERE I AM -- CAN I SUPPORT THE BILL RIGHT NOW BUT I'M OPEN TO SUPPORTING IT ON THE FLOOR. IF WE CAN GET SOME OF THE GROUP. TO A TO BE NEUTRAL ON IT SO THE PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. MOTION TO PASSED THE COMEDIAN LOCAL GOVERNMENT [inaudible] DAVE. NO. NO. GABRIEL. GLORIA AYE GLORIA AYE KILEY. KILEY NO. LEE MON THE MONTH I MAIENSCHEIN MAIENSCHEIN NIGHT QUIRK SILVA. QUIRK SILVA AYE GABRIEL GABRIEL HI [inaudible] CHIU [inaudible] HI. THAT MOTION DOES PASS ON TO COMMITTEE ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT YEAH. THEY WERE DONE RIGHT. WE HAVE TWO OF AYE TWO OTHER IDEAS TO WORK AND I THINK THE NEXT ITEM IS FILE ITEM. TWELVE A FIVE FIVE ITEM NUMBER TWELVE OF AB. FOURTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN EIGHTY FOURTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN COLLEAGUES THIS IS A BILL TO ADDRESS THE HOUSING CRISIS IN THE BAY AREA -- AS ALL OF YOU I BELIEVE KNOW OUR REGION HAS BEEN THE EPICENTER OF THE STATE'S HOUSING CRISIS WITH RECORD HOME PRICES RENTS AND HOMELESSNESS LEVELS WITH COUNTLESS RESIDENTS TO SPEND HOURS DRIVING EVERY DAY. WHO ARE ONE PAYCHECK AWAY FROM EVICTION WHO ARE CONTEMPLATING MOVING OUT OF OUR STATE? THE BAY AREA FACES IS CRISIS FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS BUT ONE IN PARTICULAR AS A REGION WE HAVE FAILED TO PRODUCE HOUSING AT ALL INCOME LEVELS WE FAILED TO PRESERVE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. WE FAIL TO PROTECT RESIDENTS FROM DISPLACEMENT AT A TIME WHEN JOB CREATION HAS BEEN AT A RECORD HIGH WITH OUR REGION. WELL HOUSING IS A REGIONAL ISSUE THAT REQUIRES POLICY AND FUNDING COORDINATION THERE HAS NOT BEEN THIS REGIONAL APPROACH IN THE BAY. INSTEAD WE HAVE A HUNDRED AND ONE CITIES AND NINE COUNTIES MAKING INDIVIDUAL DECISIONS -- THAT OF UNFORTUNATELY NOT ADDRESS THE CRISIS. THE CONCEPT FOR THIS BILL CAME FROM A DIVERSE COALITION F BAY AREA HOUSING STAKEHOLDERS THAT ARE TYPICALLY AT ODDS. WHO CAME TOGETHER TO ASK THE STATE TO EMPOWER OUR REGION TO HELP OURSELVES? BECAUSE NO PUBLIC ENTITY IN THE BAY AREA HAS BEEN FOCUSED ON HOUSING THIS BILL WOULD ESTABLISH A REGIONAL HOUSING ENTITY WHICH WE REFER TO AS THE HOUSING ALLIANCE FOR THE BAY AREA. LIKE PREVIOUS STATE BILLS IT CREATED THE BAY AREA TOLL AUTHORITY TO FOCUS ON TRANSPORTATION FUNDING. AND THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY RESTORATION AUTHORITY TO FOCUS ON THE BAY THIS BILL WOULD ESTABLISH. AN ENTITY FOCUSED ON A REGION'S HOUSING NEEDS. IT'S ESTIMATED THAT OUR REGION ALONE NEEDS AN ADDITIONAL TWO AND A HALF A BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR TO ADDRESS OUR HOUSING NEEDS ARE FOR WASHING NEEDS. TO THIS ENTITY WOULD BE ABLE TO PROPOSE REVENUE MEASURES ON THE BALLOT IN THE NINE COUNTY BAY AREA REGION. A SELF HELP APPROACH TO ENABLE OUR REGION TO RAISE REVENUES WITHOUT FURTHER BURDENING THE STATE. THESE REVENUES WOULD BE ADDITIVE TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING FUNDING ALREADY AVAILABLE IN THE REGION AND THE ENTITY WOULD NOT DIVERT ANY EXISTING FUNDING STREAMS FROM LOCAL JURIST TIONS. WITH THESE FUNDS THE ENTITY WOULD PROVIDE CRITICAL FUNDING TO HOUSING PROJECTS AROUND THE BAY PROVIDE STAFF SUPPORT AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. FUND TENANTS SERVICES SUCH AS EMERGENCY RENTAL ASSISTANCE AND ACCESS TO COUNSEL. A SIMPLE PARCELS AND ACQUIRE LAND TO BUILD HOUSING AND MONITOR REPORT ON PROGRESS AT A REGIONAL LEVEL. I WANT TO MAKE IT VERY CLEAR THIS BODY WOULD HAVE NO AUTHORITY TO REGULATE WARNED FORCED LAND USE DECISIONS OR CHOIR PROPERTY BY EMINENT DOMAIN -- THE BODY WOULD BE GOVERNED BY BOARD COMPOSED OF LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS WITH AN ADVISORY BODY COMPRISED OF REGIONAL HOUSING EXPERTS. ARE BAY AREA HOUSING CRISIS NOT ONLY THREATENS THE BAY AREA BUT MAJOR ECONOMIC DRIVERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THIS BILL WOULD EMPOWER OUR REGION TO FINALLY ADDRESS OUR REGIONAL HOUSING CRISIS. WITH THAT LIKE TO TURN OVER TO ONCE IS STARTING WITH YOU TO ROUTE FROM ENTERPRISE COMMUNITY PARTNERS. HI MY NAME IS KEEP THE ROW AND I'M WITH ENTERPRISE CAN YOU PARTNERS AND WE ARE DELIGHTED TO BE STE CO SPONSORING AB. FOURTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN XIN IS TO CREATE OPPORTUNITY FOR LOW AND MODERATE INCOME FAMILIES THROUGH AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND LAST YEAR I CO AUTHORED THIS REPORT IT'S CALLED ELEPHANT IN THE REGION CHARTING A PATH FOR THE BAY AREA MEASURE TO LEAD A BOLD REGIONAL HOUSING AGENDA. AND YES IT DOES HAVE AN ELEPHANT ON IT. AND WHAT THIS REPORT DID IS WE LOOKED AT OTHER REGIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO SEE HOW THEY'RE ADDRESSING THEIR AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS. AND FOR THOSE REGIONS THAT HAVE THAT HAVE DONE IT WELL THERE'S A KEY THERE'S A KEY FINDING. AND THAT'S THAT THEY HAVE BUILT A ROBUST HOUSING INFRASTRUCTURE. AND THAT INFRASTRUCTURE HAS INCLUDED THE FIRST COMPONENT IS FUNDING AND THE SECOND COMPONENT IS CAPACITY CAPACITY TO ADMINISTER PROGRAMS AND POLICIES. AND ALSO DEPLOY INNOVATIVE -- FINANCING SOLUTIONS. SO WE ARE INVESTED IN THIS LEGISLATION. BECAUSE IT IS A BOLD REGIONAL HOUSING SOLUTION AND IT BEGINS TO SAT. THAT ROBUST HOUSING INFRASTRUCTURE THE BAY AREA NEEDS. RIGHT NOW -- WE RELY ON OUR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO SOLVE THE ENTIRE AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS. IN THEIR SIMPLY THERE SIMPLY ISN'T CAPACITY THERE AFTER REDEVELOPMENT WHAT YOU'VE JUST BEEN TALKING ABOUT AFTER WAS DISSOLVED. A LOT OF THE HOUSING DEPARTMENTS ON THEIR STAFF IS BEING GUIDED THEY DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE KNOW HOW. AND SO THIS BILL IS REALLY -- IT'S TO HELP THESE JURISDICTIONS IT'S A SET OF CARROTS IT'S FUNDING IT'S TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AT STAFFING CAPACITY IT HELPS WITH DATA AND MONITORING MODERNI. AND THERE'S NO STICKS AROUND EMINENT DOMAIN OUR LAND USE AUTHORITY. SO ENTERPRISE WE'VE BEEN ENGAGING -- HOUSING DEPARTMENTS AND HOUSING AGENCIES TO FIND OUT HOW COULD THE HOUSING ALLIANCE OF THE BAY AREA HELP THEM. AND THEY'VE GIVEN EXAMPLES AFTER -- THE WILD FIRES TO HELP HAVE HELP ARE DEPLOYING INNOVATIVE FINANCING RESOURCES TO REBUILD COMMUNITIES AND HOUSING -- TO HELP PROVIDE THE GAP FUNDING IN ATLANTA SIMPLY NEEDED FOR TEO DE DEVELOPMENTS. AND ALSO FOR WITH HELP FOR JURISDICTIONS TO ADMINISTER TENET PROTECTIONS. AND SO AND ALSO FOR THE PAST YEAR AND OUR PRICES BUT WORKING REALLY CLOSELY WITH A CORE GROUP OF EQUITY ADVOCATES AND IN THIS BILL -- THE PRESERVATION AND THE PROTECTION AS IT'S JUST IS BALANCED ALONG WITH THE PRODUCTION. SO -- THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY AND WE URGE YOUR A VOTE. UP TO CHAIR MEMBERS AT MATT REAGAN WITH THE BAY AREA COUNCIL AGAIN -- HERE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL I'M JUST FOR SOME PERSPECTIVE -- AND WHY THIS BILL IS NECESSARY IN OUR REGION -- THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA REGION IS THE FASTEST GROWING DEVELOP ECONOMY IN THE WORLD WERE GROWING AT ABOUT FOUR POINT WE'RE ADDING IN SOME MONTHS TEN THOUSAND NEW JOBS A MONTH -- OUR LITTLE NINE COUNTY AREA -- OUR ECONOMY IS LARGER THAN FORTY FIVE STATES -- SO IT'S A IT'S OUR OUR JOB CREATORS ARE ARE DOING A FANTASTIC JOB OF CREATING JOBS BUT WE DON'T HAVE THE TOOLS IN THE TOOLBOX -- TO CREATE A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF NEW HOUSING UNITS TO ACCOMMODATE THAT GROWTH -- WE BUY A QUIRK OF HISTORY AS AS AS CHAIRMAN CHIU SAD -- WE DEVELOPED A VERY BALKANIZED WAY AS A REGION WITH NINE KIND IS A HUNDRED AND ONE CITIES. PEER METROS LIKE NEW YORK OR CHICAGO THEY THEY ANNEXED THEIR BORROWS AND AND A HALF CREATED REGIONAL SOLUTIONS TO THEIR HOUSING PROBLEM WE DID THAT TO A DEGREE WITH WITH AIR QUALITY WE HAVE A WIN AT BAY AREA AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT LATER ADDRESS OUR TRAFFIC ACT CONCERNS TO ADDRESS. SEA LEVEL RISE CONCERNS. BUT OUR BIGGEST CONCERN IS IS HOUSING AND WE DON'T HAVE A REGIONAL SOLUTION TO THAT. THIS BILL WOULD CREATE A REGIONAL FUNDING MECHANISM TO HELP. THOSE ONE HUNDRED AND ONE CITIES AND NINE COYOTES HAVE A A REGIONAL APPROACH IN A REGIONAL FOCUS TO SOLVING OUR AFFORDABLE HOUSING -- CRISIS THIS DOES NOT USURP THEIR AUTHORITY IT AUGMENTS THEIR ABILITY -- SO WE WOULD URGE AN AYE VOTE AND JUST TODAY WE WE HAVE -- PUBLISHED A REPORT ON THE REGION'S HOMELESSNESS PROBLEM AND TO SHARE SOME DATA FROM THAT REPORT THREE HUNDRED AND SIX THOUSAND HOMES IN THE BAY AREA. OR BELOW 30% A AM I 50% OF THOSE HOMES ARE PAYING SORRY TWO THIRDS OF THOSE -- HOUSEHOLDS ARE PAYING OVER 50% OF THEIR TAKE HOME PAY ON RENT -- OUR HOUSING CRISIS IS CREATED GENERATIONAL POVERTY AND WE DON'T HAVE THE TOOLS IN OUR TOOLBOX TO GET FAMILIES OUT OF GENERATIONAL POVERTY. THIS WON'T SOLVE IT BY ITSELF BUT IT IS ONE ADDITIONAL TOO LITTLE HELP OUR RESOLVE OUR AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS WE ORIGINALLY THOUGHT THANK YOU. THANK YOU DO WE HAVE ANY -- A WITNESS IN SUPPORT THIS BILL IN IN THE IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I GUESS AS FOR NAME ORGANIZATIONS. MICHAEL IN MISSILE CONDO AT HOME IS STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU. MICHELLE PERCENT PUBLIC ADVOCATES WE ARE SUPPORT IF AMENDED AND LOVE THE THREE PIECE FRAMING. LOOK FORWARD TO BEING IS FOR THIS BILL. THANK YOU. KEVIN RACY TECH EQUITY COLLABORATIVE WERE IN STRONG SUPPORT. TYRONE BUCKLEY HOUSING CALIFORNIA ALSO SPORT. HI ELIZABETH MY EMPLOYER THE SAN FRANCISCO FOUNDATION IN SUPPORT. TODD DAVID BAY AREA HOUSING UP TO SEE COALITION IN SUPPORT. I FORGOT ABOUT WITH THE NONPROFIT HOUSING ASSOCIATION IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AS A CO SPONSOR AND SUPPORT. KAREN CAMACHO WITH THE HOUSING LEADERSHIP COUNCIL SAN MATTEO COUNTY IN SUPPORT. HOLLY FOR MANY WHITE HOUSE PUBLIC AFFAIRS ON BEHALF A HABITAT FOR HUMANITY EAST BAY SILICON VALLEY IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU -- DO WE HAVE A NEED A WITNESS IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. YEAH MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS COME MORNING AGAIN DAVID WILL FOR THE HOWARD JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION OPPOSITION TO YOU AB. FOURTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN AND MEMBERS AS IT'S BEEN SAID I'LL SAY IT AGAIN WE HAVE AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA LISTEN THE ONLY 30% OF CALIFORNIANS CAN AFFORD A MEDIAN PRICED HOME IN THE STATE. IT COSTS THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ON AVERAGE TO BUILD AN AFFORDABLE UNITS OF HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA IT'S OVER SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS TO BUILD A UNIT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. SO IT IS VERY CLEAR THAT WE NEED MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND MEMBERS WE DO BELIEVE THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS A ROLE TO PLAY IN PROVIDING ADDITIONAL AFFORDABLE HOUSING. BUT WHEN ONLY 30% OF CALIFORNIANS CAN AFFORD A MEDIAN PRICED HOME ADVOCATING -- FOR NEW PERSONAL TAXES WHICH ARE VERY REGRESSIVE WHICH DIRECTLY IMPACT PROPERTY OWNERS ARE NOT GONNA DO ANYTHING TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND AGAIN WE DO BELIEVE THE LEGISLATURE HAS A ROLE TO PLAY THEY CAN LOWER IMPACT FEES THEY CAN REFORM INCLUSIONARY ZONING TO ACTUALLY PROMOTE UNIT DEVELOPMENT. THEY CAN REMOVE COSTLY MANDATES A NEW DEVELOPMENT INCLUDING RENT CONTROL AND SOLAR PANELS ON NEW HOMES -- THEY CAN REMOVE REGULATORY BURDENS ON SEQUEL LOST -- MAINTAINING ALL OF ITS ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONS WHICH WE WOULD BE IN SUPPORT OF WE NEED TO TAKE THE STEPS MEMBERS AND NOT JUST LOOK AT AUTHORIZING NEW REVENUE SOURCES TO FIX THIS PROBLEM. REVENUE HAS A PIECE TO THAT WE DIDN'T TAKE A POSITION ON THE HOUSING BOND LAST YEAR WHEN IT WAS ON THE BALLOT. YOU KNOW REVENUE DOES HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY IN THIS BUT IT'S NOT THE ONLY ROLE I THINK THIS LEGISLATURE CAN DO MORE NEEDS TO DO MORE BEFORE WE ADVANCEMENT PROGRAMS SUCH AS THIS TASK FOR AN OVER. THANK YOU WAS THE WOLF -- ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. SEEING HEARING NONE OF QUESTION OR COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. WHO'S BEEN IN MOTION AND A SECOND OF THIS GERMAN WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. ME JUST CLARIFY A FEW THINGS AND APPRECIATE THE PERSPECTIVE FROM HOWARD JARVIS SO THIS BILL DOES NOT. AUTOMATICALLY AUTHORIZE REVENUES WHAT IT DOES IS IT ESTABLISHES A REGIONAL BODY MADE UP OF LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS THAT COULD DECIDE AMONG A VARIETY OF POTENTIAL REVENUE OPTIONS. WHETHER TO PROPOSE A BALLOT MEASURE THAT GOES TO WITH THE NINE COUNTY BAY AREA REGION. SO THAT VOTERS COULD APPROVE THESE REVENUES SO I WANNA MAKE THAT VERY CLEAR -- SECONDLY -- WE HAVE A VERY WE HAVE AN INTENSE HOUSING CRISIS AROUND THE STATE BUT IN THE BAY AREA AS WE ALL KNOW IT'S INCREDIBLY ACUTE. AS I MENTIONED BEFORE WE HAVE A TWO AND A HALF BILLION DOLLAR FUNDING NEED AROUND AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND RATHER THAN ASKING THE REST OF THE STATE TO PICK THAT UP WHAT WE ARE SAYING AS A REGION IS WE WANT HELP OURSELVES WE KNOW THAT OUR REGION HAS BEEN. ECONOMICALLY SUCCESSFUL AND AS YOU'VE JUST HEARD THERE ARE MANY STAKEHOLDERS FROM THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY -- FROM EQUITY GROUPS AND EVERYONE IN BETWEEN WHO BELIEVE THAT WE CAN. HOPE OURSELVES TO ADDRESSES BUT WE NEED TO COME TOGETHER AS A REGION WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DO THIS AS A HUNDRED AND ONE SEPARATE CITIES AS NINE SEPARATE COUNTIES -- AND WITHOUT NOT ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT IN A STABLE SHEEN A REGIONAL ENTITY SO WE CAN START THIS CONVERSATION. THANK YOU SIR OF THE SECRETARY WILL CALL THE ROLL. OUR MOTION TO PASSED TO THE COMMITTEE ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT GAVE. NINE FORTY AND FOURTEEN APRIL. GABRIEL I GLORIA GLORIA I KILEY. KILEY NO LEE MON. THE MONEY I MAIENSCHEIN MAIENSCHEIN NIGHT QUIRK SILVA. QUIRK SILVA NO [inaudible] CHIU [inaudible] I OF THIS CHAIRMAN YOU HAVE THE OF THE VOTE TO GET THIS OUT OF COMMITTEE THANKS VERY MUCH AND OF MY APOLOGIES THERE'S A COMMITTEE THAT'S BEEN WAITING FOR ME FOR MANY MINUTES TO COMMON. BUT MISTER GLORIA IS A FAR BETTER SOFTBALL PLAYER THAN I AND SO I'VE ASKED IN A PINCH IT. ON THIS. ONE BUT WE DO HAVE WE DO HAVE TIME FOR YOU THAT WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT. YEAH WE WELL -- THANK RACES. THE GERMAN WE WILL TAKE UP NOW ITEM OF FILE ITEM NUMBER SEVENTEEN AB SEVENTEEN SIXTY THREE YOU MAY OPEN SIR THANK YOU THE SHOULD BE A SHORT ITEM AND APPRECIATE MR GLORIA BEING WILLING. TO MOVING QUICKLY APPRECIATE THAT VERY BRIEFLY -- THIS IS A BILL THAT WOULD PROVIDE ADDITIONAL DENSITY BONUSES FOR A TO ADDRESS A NUMBER OF CHALLENGES WE ALL KNOW THAT ZONING IS OFTEN A BEAR TO HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. EXISTING ZONING DENSITY IN HEIGHT ARE OFTEN TOO LOW FOR THESE PROJECTS THE PENCIL OUT. CERTAINLY UP FUNDING FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS VERY SCARCE AND WE WANT TO STRETCH EVERY DOLLAR WE CAN'T BRED TO BUILD MORE UNITS PER DOLLAR. AND THEN THIRDLY FOR FOR WHAT HOUSING DEVELOPERS THAT ARE COMPETING WITH MARKET RATE DEVELOPERS FOR SITE MORE DENSITY CAN MAKE A PROJECT FINANCIALLY FEASIBLE TO GIVE THAT AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPER THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMPETE. UNDER THIS BILL THESE PROJECTS WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR AN 80% DENSITY BONUS ABOVE EXISTING ZONE DENSITY AND FOR INCENTIVES OR CONCESSIONS. ARE -- FOR IF THEY'RE PROJECTS THAT ARE NEAR TRANSIT THEY WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR UNLIMITED DENSITY BONUSES PLUS AN INCREASE IN HEIGHT OR FOR AREA RATIO UP TO A LIMIT. SO WITH THAT LIKE TO TURN OVER TO MS WHITE FROM THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING CONSORTIUM ARE BILL SPONSOR. THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS RAIN A WHITE WITH THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING CONSORTIUM PROUD TO BE A SPONSORING THIS SPELL IT'S REALLY CRITICAL FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS AND REALLY APPRECIATE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU CARRYING THIS BILL I AS AS YOU KNOW AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS FACE MANY CHALLENGES AND BUILDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING -- AND ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO SORT OF GIVE THEM THE FLEXIBILITY TO TO MAKE A PROJECT PENCIL AS WELL AS POSSIBLE IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR US TO DO ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF LIMITED RESOURCES -- AND WHAT WHAT I WANT TO JUST MAKE NOTE OF UNDER EGGS ALL OF THE FINANCING PROGRAMS THAT A FOR A HOUSING DEVELOPERS USE. THEY ALREADY HAVE IT MANY REQUIREMENTS MINIMUM UNIT SIZES -- THE DENSITY BONUS PROGRAM ALLOWS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO IMPLEMENT THEIR OWN PROGRAM THEY'RE STILL LOCAL STANDARDS AND SO WE'RE NOT TRYING TO JUST BUILD SOME MASSIVE BOX WITH IN CRAMPED MANY HOUSEHOLDS AS POSSIBLE AND IT BUT TO JUST GIVE A LITTLE BIT MORE FLEXIBILITY AND ALLOW AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS. TO PRODUCE THE NECESSARY UNITS THAT WE NEED TO STATEWIDE -- SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME OR DRIVE OUT TODAY.
