SB TWO ZERO TWO DEALING WITH ANIMAL BLOOD DONORS. AND SENATOR BEFORE YOU BEGAN IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU MET WITH THE CALVET CALIFORNIA VETERINARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION REGARDING THE USE OF THE TERM GUARDIAN THROUGHOUT THE BILL. AND THAT YOU'RE TAKING AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD REPLACE THE WORD GUARDIAN WITH THE OWNER. ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU. AND YOU'VE AGREED TO TAKE THIS IS AUTHORS AMENDMENTS TODAY. YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH PLEASE GO AHEAD PRESENT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. LIKE WHAT. ARE WE CAN SKIP THAT PART BECAUSE I AM GONNA TAKE THE AMENDMENTS. SO SB TWO OH TWO IS AN IMPORTANT MEASURE TO ENSURE THAT HEALTHY AND BOUNTIFUL BLOOD SUPPLY FOR ANIMALS IS AVAILABLE ACROSS THE STATE. CALIFORNIA'S CURRENTLY FACING A SHORTAGE OF ANIMAL BLOOD PRODUCTS IN THE STATE NEEDS TO HELP TO ENSURE THE WELL BEING OF OUR ANIMALS AND PETS. SB TWO OH TWO CLARIFIES EXISTING LAW TO ALLOW FOR THE LICENSURE COMMUNITY BASED ANIMAL BLOOD BANKS. AMBIGUITY IN THE CURRENT CODE IS LEAD TO MORE LIMITED REGULATORY FRAMEWORK. ALLOWING ONLY FOR THE COMMERCIAL USE OF BLOOD FROM -- CLOSED COLONY BANKS WHICH KEEP DOGS AND CATS HOUSE OF FOR YEARS ON THEIR PREMISES TO TO EXTRACT THEIR BLOOD. WELL THESE BLOOD BANKS PLAY A CRUCIAL ROLE ROLE IN CALIFORNIA'S VETERINARIAN. VETERINARIAN MEDICAL WORLD. MAKING ALLOWANCES FOR COMMUNITY ANIMAL DONORS AS WELL WILL HELP INCREASE THE BLOOD SUPPLY. AND ENSURE THAT BOTH ANIMALS AND FAMILIES PROSPER BY HAVING THESE PETS IN THEIR IN THEIR HOMES THIS BILL WILL ALLOW THE ANIMAL OWNERS TO VOLUNTEER THEIR DOGS AND CATS. FOR BLOOD DONATIONS. UNDER THE OVERSIGHT OF A LICENSED MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL. WE HAVE DISCUSSES PROBE PROPOSAL AT LENGTH WITH EXISTING ANIMAL BLOOD BANKS AND WE ARE RECEPTIVE TO THEIR CONCERNS AND AND WILLING TO CONTINUE TO DIALOGUE ON STICKING ISSUES. LOOK. FOR BOARD WORKING WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS IN REACHING A GOAL THAT SUITS EVERYONE IN BENEFITS THE ENTIRE ANIMAL COMMUNITY. WITH ME TODAY I HAVE DOCTORS KAREN HALOGEN. TO PRESENT TESTIMONY YEAH HI I'M DOCTOR HALOGEN I GRADUATED FROM UC DAVIS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE SO I'VE BEEN PRACTICING THIRTY YEARS. I'M CURRENTLY THAT CHEAP THAT OFFICER FOR THE LUCY PET FOUNDATION AND WE PROVIDE FREE SPIN NEUTER SERVICES AND WELLNESS FOR LOW INCOME RESIDENTS IN THE CITY OF LA. I ALSO SERVED ON THE AMERICAN RED CROSS BOARD IN LOS ANGELES FOR SIX YEARS. AND I AM CURRENTLY ON THE BOARD OF SOCIAL COMPASSIONATE LEGISLATION WHICH IS THE PROUD SPONSOR. OF SB. TWO OH TWO CALIFORNIA IS THE ONLY STATE IN THE NATION. THAT DOES NOT ALLOW COMMUNITY BASED ALLIED BANK. AND THERE'S ONLY TWO COMPANIES IN THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT PROVIDE THIS LIFESAVING BLOOD. OR CATS AND DOGS TO COMPANIES. I BELIEVE IT'S TIME FOR THIS MONOPOLY TO END. AND YOU NEED TO OPEN THE MARKET SO WHAT THAT'S GOING TO DO IS THAT'S GOING TO ALLOW. AT ITS CAN ALLEVIATE THE SHORTAGE THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY SEEING BECAUSE SOMETIMES THE WAIT TIME IS CRITICAL FOR AN ANIMAL IT GETS HIT BY A CAR AND IT'S BLEEDING NOW. WE NEED BLOOD HE HAS AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE IT'S DYING RIGHT THERE IN FRONT OF YOUR EYES WE NEED BLOOD. I EIGHTY THE DOG EATS RAT POISON AND THEY'RE BLEEDING OUT THERE SO MANY TIMES THAT WE NEED BOOD AND THERE'S A CURRENT SHORTAGE. BECAUSE AS I SAID THERE'S ONLY TWO COMPANIES THAT PROVIDE FOR US. I'M AT THAT THE POSSIBILITIES ARE ENDLESS INCLUDING I SEE LIKE THE AMERICAN RED CROSS MOBILE BLOOD BANKS -- THAT'S GONNA ALLOW HUGE INCREASE OF BLOOD TO VETERINARIANS CATS AND DOGS. IN CALIFORNIA SO. SB TWO OH TWO IS GOOD FOR CALIFORNIA THAT'S IT'S GOOD FOR CALIFORNIA DOGS AND CATS AND IT'S GOOD FOR CALIFORNIA. HAD OWNERS TO PLEASE VOTE YES IN SUPPORT SB. TWO OH TWO THANK YOU VERY MUCH DO WE HAVE OTHERWISE -- MY SECOND WITNESS HERE THIS IS DOCTOR HAD THE RALLY TO PROVIDE JUST PLEASE. THANK YOU WELCOME [inaudible] GOOD MORNING. MY NAME IS HEATHER RALLY I'M A CALIFORNIA BASED VETERINARIAN I'VE BEEN WORKING ON FOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS EXCLUSIVELY ON ANIMAL WELFARE ISSUES. AS THE SUPERVISING VETERINARIAN FOR THE PIZZA FOUNDATION -- I'M HERE TO SUPPORT SENATE BILL TWO OH TWO THIS BILL WOULD OPEN UP A NEW FRONTIER FOR VETERINARY BUSINESS AND IT WOULD ALSO HELP CREATE A MORE ROBUST AND RELIABLE SUPPLY OF LIFESAVING BLOOD PRODUCTS. FOR DOGS ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND BEYOND. THIS BILL IS IN MY OPINION LOOKS REALLY A WIN FOR EVERYONE INVOLVED FROM MY VETERINARY COLLEAGUES AND OUR PATIENTS. TO THE OWNERS WHO DEPEND UPON US TO PROVIDE THE BEST VETERANS ARE POSSIBLE TO THEIR BELOVED PETS TO THE DONOR DOGS THEMSELVES. MEET ANY BLOOD BANKS ARE VIABLE AND INDEED ARE LITERALLY THRIVING ACROSS THE COUNTRY RIGHT NOW. IN THESE BUSINESSES HEALTHY DONOR DOGS WHO LIVE IN LOVING HOMES ARE VOLUNTEERED BY THEIR GUARDIANS. TO PROVIDE BLOOD FOR DOGS IN NEED. THESE DOGS AND THEIR OWNERS BENEFIT FROM RECEIVING -- PREVENTATIVE HEALTH CARE AND ROUTINE HEALTH SCREENINGS OFTEN AT LOWER NO COST. AND THEN RECIPIENT DOGS A VETERINARIANS BENEFIT FROM THE AVAILABILITY OF SAFE AND RELIABLE BLOOD PRODUCTS. WHICH ARE ALL TOO OFTEN IN SHORT SUPPLY I'M IN CALIFORNIA. EVERY SINGLE DOG DESERVE TO LIVE IN A LOVING HOME. AND EVERY SINGLE DOES NOT A DOG DESERVES THE BEST VETERINARY CARE POSSIBLE THIS IS BOTH ACHIEVABLE -- THIS IS ACHIEVABLE AND QUITE SIMPLE AND WE PLEASE WE WOULD LIKE FOR YOU FOR SUPPORT FOR SB TO A TWO THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. HI I'M JUDY MAY INCLUSO FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT AS SOCIAL COMPASSION AND LEGISLATION I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF MY GROUP AND COCOA. PLEASE SUPPORT THE BILL AND THANK YOU SENATOR WILK. GOOD MORNING SUSAN MADDEN ACT LIKE HAS PUBLIC AFFAIRS ON BEHALF OF ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE FUND IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION WERE WITH CONCERNS. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF MA'AM JERRY AND OF SHARED WILL MIKE DILLON REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA VETERINARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION WHERE IN THAT -- TWEENER POSITION WE APPRECIATE VERY VERY MUCH THE COMMITTEE AND SENATOR WILK AGREEING TO TAKE OUT OF THE WORD GUARDIAN. AND WITH THESE AMENDMENTS -- WE COMPLETELY REMOVE OPPOSITION AND OUR BOARD OF GOVERNORS MEETS THIS WEEKEND AND THEY WILL BE TAKEN A FORMAL POSITION BUT AS AMENDED WE THINK THE BILL AS A VERY POSITIVE STEP IN ALLOWING FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A COMMUNITY SOURCED. I BANKS AND THE WHILE STILL ALLOWING THE TWO EXISTING BLOOD BANKS TO CONTINUE THEIR OPERATIONS ARE VETERINARIAN FEEL VERY STRONGLY THAT COMPLETING SHUTTING THEM DOWN WOULD BE. A REAL PROBLEM AND SO ALLOWING IT -- TO TO GO FORWARD WE THINK IS A POSITIVE STEP THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NEXT WITNESS. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS CHAT BRIEFLY **** GREENBERG TRAURIG ON BEHALF OF ANIMAL BLOOD BANK -- ANIMAL BLOOD BANK IS VERY SUPPORTIVE OF COMMUNITY SOURCED BLOOD BANKING IN FACT THEY OPERATE A COMMUNITY SOURCED BLOOD BANK IN MICHIGAN -- I WOULD TELL YOU THAT THERE IS A SHORTAGE OF BLOOD NOT ONLY IN CALIFORNIA. BUT THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES WERE COMMUNITY FORCED BLOOD BANKS OPERATE SO WE WELCOME -- QUALITY BLOOD TO THE MARKET. I'M WILL DO OUR BEST TO SUPPORT COMMUNITY BLOOD BANKS. A WE DO HAVE THREE CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL PRINCIPALLY THAT -- THE CONFIDENTIALITY PROTECTION THAT EXISTS IN IN CURRENT LAW AND THAT IS PROPOSED FOR THE COMMUNITY SOURCE BLOOD BANKS NEEDS TO BE CONTINUED. I'M FOR REASONS THAT WERE CLEAR TWENTY YEARS AGO AND REMAIN TODAY. I'M ALSO HAD THE BILL WOULD CHANGE. THE LICENSING REQUIREMENT FROM A PERSON QUALIFIED TO RUN A BLOOD BANK TO A LICENSED VETERINARIAN THAT IS BOTH A TOO STRINGENT INTO ENGINE TO LENIENT IN THAT YOU DON'T NEED TO BE A VETERINARIAN TO RUN A BLOOD BANK. AND JUST BECAUSE YOU ARE A VETERINARIAN DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN'T RUN A BLOOD BANK. SO WE THINK EXISTING LAWS PINE AN EXISTING LAW ALSO REQUIRES OVERSIGHT BY A LICENSED VETERINARIAN SO-- HAVING IT RUN BY A BY A LICENSED VETERINARIAN IS DUPLICATIVE. AND FINALLY. THERE'S A PROVISION IN EXISTING LAW THAT TALKS ABOUT THE MAXIMUM LENGH OF TIME. A DONATION IN THE BILL WOULD CHANGE -- THE WORD OR TAKE AND THAT PROVISION WAS PUT THERE TO ACCOMMODATE THE TWO EXISTING BLOOD BANKS ONE OF WHICH RELIES UPON THE THE FIRST PROPOSITION. EIGHT THEY TAKE. A DONOR OR THEY TAKE DOGS FROM THE GREYHOUND RACING INDUSTRY -- WHO DONATE FOR A PERIOD OF TIME BEFORE THEY -- OR TRANSFERRED OWNERSHIP TO ANOTHER HOME WHERE IS ANIMAL BLOOD BANK HAS ALWAYS RESCUED ANIMALS -- AND NOW HAS TO USE BRED ANIMALS BECAUSE OF RESCUE ANIMALS ARE NO LONGER AVAILABLE TO THEM BUT THOSE ANIMALS DONATE WHILE THEY'RE HEALTHY. AND WHEN THEY'RE NOT HEALTHY THEY CONTINUE ON AS PART OF THE PACK. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION OR WITH CONCERNS. OKAY -- TO THE AUTHOR COULD YOU RESPOND FOR THE COMMITTEE TO THE CONCERNS THAT WERE JUST RAISE AN OPTION. I THINK WE'VE GOT A MEETING SCHEDULE LATER LATER THIS WEEK -- TODAY TO DISCUSS TO DISCUSS THOSE ISSUES -- AND NUMBER THOSE ISSUES I I THINK. RE BE TOTALLY AMENABLE -- TO NEED TO HAVE MORE DISCUSSIONS ON THAT ON THAT. ON THE ASPECT OF THE CONFIDENTIALITY -- WE'RE NOT RELEASING ANY PERSON'S NAME IS JUST GONNA BE DATA ON ON ON ON THE THE DOCKS THEMSELVES MEDICAL DATA SO ON SO BUT WE WE ARE GOING TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS AS YOU KNOW THIS IS A COLLABORATIVE PROCESS. AND THE WHOLE POINT OF THE BILL IS NOT TO PUT ANYBODY OUT OF BUSINESS AS MORE RADICAL APPROACH BEING TAKEN OVER IN THE ASSEMBLY SIDE. BUT TO JUST. TO INCREASE THE RATE LIABILITY OF THESE BLOOD BANKS AND THEN AGAIN AS MENTIONED BY THE DOCTOR TO HAVE THESE. HER DOGS YOU KNOW RAISED IN A LOVING ENVIRONMENT SO IT'S A WIN WIN FOR THE DOGS FOR THE FAMILIES. AND FOR THE RECIPIENTS OF THE OF THE BLOOD DONATION SO YEAH WE'RE GOOD GOING TO CONTINUE TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS. AND AND GET A BILL THAT HOPEFULLY WE ALL CAN GET TO BUT AND IT'S ABOUT RELIABLE. SOURCE OF THE BLOOD -- ARE AT AND PERHAPS YOU COULD CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT MAYBE FURTHER CLARIFYING A PERSON QUALIFIED IN THE FIELD I THINK WE'RE I THINK WE'RE TOTALLY OPEN TO THAT OKAY.

THAT CLOSES A LOOPHOLE IN THE CURRENT LAW THAT ALLOWS FOR COMPANIES TO USE THE NAMES OF APPELLATIONS IN THE PRODUCTS IN ADVERTISING AND IT FURTHER CLARIFIES THE ORGANIC CERTIFICATION PROGRAM FOR CANNABIS IN CANADA PRODUCTS ON THE GOLDEN STATE. CURRENTLY IS YOUNG THOUGH IT IS LEGAL FOR CANVAS PRODUCTS USING NAME OF A CALIFORNIA COUNTY THE PRODUCT'S LABELING ITS MARKETING OR PACKAGING. EVEN IF THE CANNABIS WAS DOT RHONE IN THAT COUNTY BOARDS. BUT THERE IS A LOOPHOLE UNDER THE MEDICAL AND DON'T USE CANNABIS REGULATION AND SAFETY ACT THAT ALLOWS FOR THE LABELING OF CANVAS PRODUCTS TO MISREPRESENT THE NAME OF APPELLATIONS. THIS CAN MAKE CONSUMERS THINK THAT THE PRODUCT THEIR PURCHASING IS GROWN IN A SPECIFIC REGION. IN FACT IT'S NOT. SB ONE EIGHTY FIVE EXPANDS THE PROHIBITIONS RD STATUTE. ON IMPROPERLY USING COUNTY NAMES FOR CANNABIS PRODUCTS DO INCLUDE ANY SIMILAR SOUNDING NAME APPELLATIONS THAT IS LIKELY TO MISREPRESENT THE ORIGIN OF THE PRODUCT. THIS WILL ENSURE THAT IF PRODUCTS ARE LABELED IN WAYS THAT LEAD CONSUMERS TO BELIEVE THERE FROM CERTAIN AREAS. THOSE PRODUCTS SHOULD IN FACT BE FROM THOSE LOCATIONS. SIMULATING LIES HAVE SUCCESSFULLY BEEN IN PLACE FOR WINE HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND AT THE FEDERAL LEVELS FOR YEARS. AND IT IS PROMOTED CORPORATE ACCOUNTABILITY AND CLARITY FOR CUSTOMERS FOR EXAMPLE WHEN A CONSUMER BUYS.

THE DATA COLLECTED WOULD BE ORGANIZED BY SPECIFIC CATEGORIES. SOME COUNTIES ARE FINDING THAT BECAUSE CANNABIS IS CURRENTLY NOT INCLUDED IN THE ANNUAL CROP REPORT IT IS NOT AN ACCURATE REPRESENTATION. OF THE COUNTY'S AGRICULTURAL CULTIVATION. NORMALIZING CANNABIS AS AN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT WILL ENCOURAGE UNLICENSED GROWERS TO COME FORWARD AND BECOME LEGITIMATE PERMITTED AND TAX PAYING BUSINESSES. I UNDERSTAND THAT THE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU FEDERATION IS SUPPOSED UNLESS AMENDED.
