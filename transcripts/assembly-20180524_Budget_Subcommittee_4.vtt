00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:04.682 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT WE REALLY NEED TO

00:38:04.249 --> 00:38:05.750 region:rollup2

CITIES AND COUNTIES AND OTHER

00:38:14.859 --> 00:38:18.596 region:rollup2
JURISDICTIONS THAT RECEIVE THESE

00:38:16.261 --> 00:38:20.198 region:rollup2

THE EXCESS RAINY DAY FUNDS ARE
