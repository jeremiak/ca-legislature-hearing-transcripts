TWO SEVENTEEN OF THE SAFE WATER FOR ALL DRINKING ACT. THANK YOU THE SAFE DRINKING WATER FOR ALL ACT [inaudible] THAT. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE LET ME BEGIN BY ACKNOWLEDGING THE LEADERSHIP OF RICHARD BLOOM WHO -- IS -- TECH TEAMING WITH US ON THIS ISSUE AS YOU MENTIONING AS OF ANOTHER BILL THAT WILL BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE LOOKING AT MORE OF THE MECHANICS THE GOVERNMENT'S OVERSIGHT ACCOUNTABILITY. OF OUR FUND OF THIS MATTER -- IS USED -- BUT THIS PARTICULAR BILL AB TWO SEVENTEEN IS FOCUSING ON THE MECHANISM THE FUNDING MECHANISM THAT IS NEEDED -- TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THE CLEAN WATER NEEDS OF ALL CALIFORNIANS AND I WANT TO EMPHASIZE. ALL CALIFORNIANS BECAUSE THE APPROACH HERE THAT WE'RE TAKING. IS A COMPREHENSIVE -- ONE SINCE LAST YEAR -- WE'VE BEEN IN A SERIES OF MEETINGS WITH. A NUMBER OF ORGANIZATIONS BOTH PUBLIC PRIVATE -- AND ALL. AND LIKE TO SAY STAKEHOLDERS THAT HAVE. US SOME SKIN IN THE GAME WHEN IT COMES TO THIS ISSUE. AND WE'VE BEEN HEARING A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT APPROACHES -- THAT THEY BELIEVE A COULD WORK. FOR US TO MEET WHAT IS AN ULTIMATE GOAL OF GENERATING A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS -- TO PROVIDE THE NECESSARY RESOURCES FOR BOTH OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE. COSTS AND IN SOME CASES THE ONE TIME INFRASTRUCTURE. INVESTMENTS I NEED TO GO IN OF FOR THE DELIVERY OF SAFE CLEAN DRINKING WATER. AND SO I AM NOT GOING TO TELL YOU YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM OUR WITNESSES THAT THERE ARE OVER MILLION CALIFORNIANS UP AND DOWN THE STATE. IRRESPECTIVE OF COMING FROM RURAL OR URBAN AREA -- THERE ARE WATER QUALITY PROBLEMS EVERYWHERE AFFECTING. FAMILIES IN THE HOUSEHOLDS AND SCHOOLS WERE OUR CHILDREN SPEND THE MAJORITY OF THE TIME -- THE WAY WE STRUCTURED THIS BILL. AS I MENTIONED HAS TAKEN A NUMBER OF IDEAS HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED BY. NUMEROUS STAKEHOLDERS. AND ONE IN PARTICULAR TO HELP US FUND -- THE NEED IS BY ESTABLISHING THE AGRICULTURAL FEES THAT MANY OF YOU MAY HAVE BEEN FAMILIAR WITH. IN THE EFFORTS THAT UP ASSEMBLY MEMBER OR SENATOR MONEY PUT FORWARD. THAT WOULD ULTIMATELY RAISE CLOSE TO THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS AND THAT -- FEED THAT WOULD BEGIN IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE AT THIS AMOUNT WOULD BE PAID ANNUALLY -- TO THE SECRETARY BY A PRODUCER THAT OWNS MORE THAN. ONE NON DAIRY CONFINED ANIMAL FACILITY -- AND SO THE OTHER APPROACH IS A FERTILIZER FEED. THAT ALSO WOULD ESTABLISH ITS COLLECTION AND TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND AGAIN VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT WAS SEEN AND SENATE BILL I BELIEVE. SIX TWO SIX SIX TWO THREE WE'VE ALSO TAKEN THE IDEA. THAT MANY WATER AGENCIES HAVE PUT FORWARD AND THAT IS THIS IDEA OF A FUN. A REFERRED TO AS A TRUST FUND ASKING THE GOVERNOR. GIVEN THAT HE HAS MADE THIS ISSUE A TOP PRIORITY. FOR TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. ARE ALLOWING US TO INTEREST TO COLLECT CLOSE TO THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS HELPING US GET CLOSER TO THAT ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR -- TARGET NUMBER -- THERE'S ALSO A CHARGE TO WATER AGENCIES THAT WE'RE REFERRING TO AS THE PUBLIC BENEFIT WATER FUND. THAT WOULD BE IN THE AMOUNT OF FIFTY CENTS TWO QUARTERS. TWO PER MONTH PER MONTH PLEASE YES THANK YOU FOR FOR EMPHASIZING THAT. AND WE'VE ALSO INCORPORATED. LANGUAGE IN THE BILL. BECAUSE IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS TRUST FUND DISCUSSION -- THAT HAS BEEN PUSHED BY WATER AGENCIES -- IT HAS BEEN SAID THAT WE SHOULD JUST FUND THIS ISSUE. THAT IN THAT MANNER USING GENERAL FUND DOLLARS AND I THINK THE MAP SAYS THAT. IN ORDER TO GENERATE THE ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT'S NEEDED. FOR THIS ISSUE YOU HAVE TO PUT A DOWN PAYMENT INTO THE TRUST FUND IN THE AMOUNT OF THREE BILLION DOLLARS. AND I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS IS COMMITTEE BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN HOWEVER. IN THE BILL WE'VE ADDED SUNSET LANGUAGE. THAT IF IN SOME WAY. THAT AMOUNT OF MONEY WAS PUT FORWARD FOR THE PURPOSE OF CLEAN WATER THAT WE WOULD SUNSET THESE WATER FEES THE TWO QUARTERS. THAT -- WERE ASKING YOU KNOW CALIFORNIANS TO PUT INTO THIS PUBLIC BENEFIT WATER FUND. IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE CLEAN WATER FOR OVER A MILLION PEOPLE. WE'VE ADDED A SECTION IN THE BILL. THAT LOOKS AT THE PROBLEM REGIONALLY. AND MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE NOT JUST CONCENTRATING OUR EFFORTS ARE INVESTMENTS IN ONE PART OF CALIFORNIA BUT THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE STATE. AS I MENTIONED THIS PROBLEM. IS OCCURRING IN URBAN AS WELL AS RURAL AREAS OF CALIFORNIA AND WE NEED TO ENSURE. THAT ALL THE WATER AGENCIES AND THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCESS TO THIS FUN TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS. THEIR WATER NEEDS AND SO WE'VE ESTABLISHED A REGIONAL APPROACH. THAT ENSURES THAT 20%. OF 1100% OF THE FUN ACTUALLY GOES BACK TO SPECIFIC AREAS PRIORITIZED BY NEED AS IT RELATES TO WHAT THE WATER BOARD HAS HIGHLIGHTED. AS THE MOST PRESSING AREAS -- WITH THIS PROBLEM. SO AB TWO SEVENTEEN UP PROVIDES A NUMBER OF PAT. FOR US TO GET TO THE END GOAL AND THAT IS TO ENSURE THAT EVERY CALIFORNIAN. AND EVERY CHILD HAS SAFE CLEAN DRINKING WATER OUT TODAY YOU'LL HEAR FROM TWO WITNESSES WE HAVE. UP TO SIGN A DANDA CO FOUNDER AND CO EXECUTIVE THE COMMUNITY WATER CENTER AND METAL AND GLITTER FEEL THE DIRECTOR PARTNERSHIPS FOR UCLA INSTITUTE WHO WILL TESTIFY ON BEHALF OF THIS BILL -- DUE TO THE CONTROVERSY OF THIS BILL AND ON UNIVERSITY OF YES AND THE IMPORTANCE OKAY THE COMPLETE. AND I'VE ALREADY I'VE ALREADY COMMITTED MYSELF TO AN AYE VOTE GIVEN THE IMPORTANCE -- WE'RE GOING TO ALLOW UP TO SIX MINUTES FOR WITNESSES BUT THEN -- FOR THOSE WHO ARE ADDING ON JUST TO NAME ORGANIZATION AND POSITION. SO WITNESSES PLEASE GO AHEAD. GREAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA AND SUB COMMITTEE AND CHAIRMAN FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP I AM SO SOME OF THEM THAT CO DIRECTOR ACTUALLY DIRECTOR AND FOUNDER OF COMMUNITY WATER CENTER. I'VE BEEN WORKING ON SAFE DRINKING WATER FOR OVER A DECADE. I AM HERE ALONG SIDE AND REPRESENTING THE ONE MILLION CALIFORNIANS WITHOUT ACCESS TO SAFE DRINKING WATER. FROM. LED IMPACTING URBAN AREAS TONIGHT TREATED OUR STAKE CONTAMINATED INNER. RULE COMMUNITY TAPS TO CHROMIUM SIX IN OUR SCHOOLS. I AM HERE TODAY ALONGSIDE WITH MOTHERS AND FATHERS WHOSE CHILDREN ARE SLOWLY BEING POISONED BY THIS TAP WATER EXPOSED EXPOSED AT SCHOOL AND AT HOME. TO THE MOST SAFEST PLACES THAT WE SHOULD NOT BE WORRIED ABOUT HEARING CALIFORNIA. IT IS TIME TO CALIFORNIA PASSES THE SAFER FOR DRINKING WATER FUND. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S NEEDED WE NEED A SUSTAINABLE AND PERMANENT FUNDING SOURCE. THAT ADDRESSES THE ROOT CAUSES OF THIS CRISIS AND THAT IT SHOULD AND WILL NOT BE CUT WHEN WE HAVE AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. WE DON'T NEED ANYMORE BANDAIDS TO SOLVE THIS ISSUE. THERE ARE SOME HERE THAT WILL SAY THAT IF HE THE PRICE OF SOME POCKET CHANGES TOO MUCH OR THERE'S ANOTHER WAY TO SOLVE THIS. WE WOULD GLADLY PAY. A LITTLE MORE EVERY MONTH TO ENSURE THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCESS TO SAFE CLEAN AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER. BECAUSE WE'RE ALREADY PAYING THIS WITH THEIR LIVES BEING EXCEPT EXPOSED TO SOME TOXIC WATER. THAT CAN GET A SICK. IT IS ABOUT IT IS THIS IS ABOUT OUR HEALTH AND THE HEALTH OF OUR KIDS. I LIKE TO SAY THAT SHAME ON THOSE THAT STAND IN BETWEEN MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE SAFE DRINKING WATER FOR KIDS ARE FAMILIES. WE RECOGNIZE THAT THIS BILL IS STILL IN PROCESS AND WE HAVE WORK TO DO. FOR THE MOMENT IS IS NOW I TRULY BELIEVE THAT THIS IS THE MOST ONE OF THE MOST DEFINING CIVIL RIGHTS STRUGGLES THAT DEFINES OUR GENERATION. MANY ARE FAMILIES ARE THIRSTY FOR JUSTICE THE HAVE BEEN LIVING LIKE THIS FOR FAR TOO LONG. WE DON'T WANT TO LIVE IN CALIFORNIA LIKE THIS ANY LONGER. WE WANT TO LIVE IN A CALIFORNIA WE CAN PHILIP GLASS A GLASS OF WATER FROM A TAP WITHOUT THE FEAR BECOMING SICK. WE WANT TO LIVE IN A CALIFORNIA WE DON'T CONDEMN FUTURE GENERATIONS TO NOT BE ABLE TO DRINK WATER FROM THE TAPS AT SCHOOL AND THEN GO HOME AND I'LL BE ABLE TO DRINK THAT. WE DON'T WANT THAT ANYMORE AND THE SOLUTION IS HERE. WE NEED TO PASS THE SAVINGS FOR DRINKING WATER FUND. AND ALLOW THIS HUMAN RIGHTS ACTUALLY HAPPEN. FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT HAVE CHILDREN PLEASE THINK OF OUR OWN THINK OF YOURS AS YOU. STICK YOUR VOTE TODAY OR CAN YOU KNOW EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU. TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN HAVE SAFE DRINKING WATER. GLASS YES THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GO AHEAD THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I MEDDLING CLICK FELD UM THE DIRECTOR OF THE UCLA WATER RESOURCES GROUP. AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU ABOUT THE WORK I'VE DONE TO IDENTIFY URBAN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY WATER SYSTEMS IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND HOW HONORED I AM TO BE STE TESTIFYING WITH SUSANNA DE HONDA WHO IS. A HERO IN THIS AREA -- I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT. HOW VOTE HOW AB ONE THIRTY FOUR AND TWO SEVENTY ONE TO SEVENTEEN SHOULD RECOGNIZE THE EXISTENCE OF DISADVANTAGE WATER SYSTEMS AND I SEE YOU FROWNING BECAUSE IT I HEARD YOU AT THE LAST HEARING SAYING WELL THIS ISN'T AN URBAN PROBLEM BUT IT DON'T? YOU KNOW I SAID IT ISN'T A PROBLEM IN MY DISTRICT OKAY. THANKS OKAY -- IS SO DO I AM THERE THERE CAN WELL BE PROBLEMS IN OAKLAND -- THAT WHERE THEY HAVE FLED. GROWING UP IN THE WATER RIGHT RIGHT. SO WHAT WHAT I'M HERE TO SAY IS THAT IF FUNDING COMES FROM URBAN WATER CONSUMERS THE BILL SHOULD AS ASSEMBLYMAN GARCIA HAS SAID. IT'S ONLY RIGHT THAT URBAN JACK SYSTEMS IN THOSE AREAS BENEFIT AND HAVE ACCESS TO THAT FUNDING AND RIGHT NOW. URBAN DECK SYSTEMS DON'T HAVE EASY ACCESS TO THE FUNDING. OF THE WORK I'VE DONE WITH DOCTOR REVOLT WE FOUND THIS THERE ARE TWO HUNDRED AND TEN WATER SYSTEMS LOS ANGELES COUNTY SOME OF THEM STARTED WHEN THE I DEVELOPMENT WOULD COME FROM NO WHERE AND THEY WOULD. DEVELOP THE COUNTY WATER SYSTEM JUST OF A COMMUNITY OR HOMEOWNERS VERSION OF A MUTUAL WATER COMPANY. I NOW OF THE TWO HUNDRED AND TEN SIXTY FOUR HAVE A CONCERT CUSTOMER BASE WITH THE MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME LESS THAN 80%. OF THOSE. SIXTY FOUR TWENTY FOUR ARE SEVERELY DISADVANTAGED OR AT THEY CANNOT AFFORD WATER RATES THAT WILL KEEP THEIR SYSTEM RUNNING. AND IF THEY END UP IN AN INDEPENDENTLY OWNED UTILITY. THEY OFTEN GET THEIR WATER SHUT OFF BECAUSE THEY HAVE GOOD WATER BUT IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE FOR THEM. THIS THIS THIS THE SYSTEMS HAVE A TOTAL OF ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND CONNECTIONS WHICH ROUGHLY AMOUNTS TO A MILLION PEOPLE LIVING IN THE SYSTEMS JUST IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY SO WHEN YOU SEE. IT NO ONE'S EVER LOOKED AT THIS BEFORE OR TRY TO GET A HANDLE ON THIS SO THE NUMBERS ARE BIG THE NUMBERS ARE BIGGER. THEY'RE CLUSTERED IN TWO PARTS OF THE COUNTY WERE POVERTY IS CLUSTERED IN THE ANTELOPE VALLEY. IN THE SOUTHEAST SOUTHWEST REGION OF THE OF THE THE OLDER PART OF TOWN. CAPITAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND OWN AND FUNDING ARE KEY TO ANY SOLUTION SO I HAVE. THREE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR YOU. THE FIRST IS THAT SOMEWHERE IN THIS LEGISLATION THAT YOU YOU ASKED THE STATE BOARD TO DETERMINE DAK WATER SYSTEMS. ON A COUNTY WIDE BASIS RIGHT NOW THEY LOOK AT CAP AT DETERMINING ELIGIBILITY WHEN AN ENTITY COMES INTO RISK. APPLY FOR A GRANT. AND THAT'S EASIER TO DO IN A RURAL AREA THAN IT IS IN URBAN FOR A WHOLE LOT OF REASONS. BUT IT DOESN'T GIVE THE MOST ACCURATE PICTURE OF URBAN SYSTEMS AND IN FACT MOST URBAN TAX SYSTEMS DON'T KNOW THAT THEIR DECK ELIGIBLE YOU HAVE ABOUT TEN SECONDS OKAY. SO I THINK WE THAT SHOULD HAPPEN THEY SHOULD INCLUDE THE FUNDING SHOULD INCLUDE WORK MONEY FOR LOCAL AGENCIES TO DO REGIONAL DAK ASSESSMENTS AND GOVERNMENT STRATEGIES. AND THE TEN THOUSAND PERSON CAP FOR ELIGIBLE DAX SYSTEMS NEEDS TO BE RAISED BECAUSE SMALL IS BIGGER IN URBAN AREAS. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT UP SO WE HAVE. JUST TO BE CLEAR OUR WE'RE TALKING THE AMENDMENT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS TO ADD -- FIFTY CENTS A MONTH. THAT WOULD BE DETERMINED BY THE NUMBER OF CONNECTIONS. IN OUR PARTICULAR -- WATER UTILITY. ONE REASON FOR DOING THAT AND FOR HAVING THE WATER BOARD COLLECTING IT IS WELL. IS TO SIMPLY MAKE THE COLLECTION THAN VERY EASY THEY CAN LOOK UP. THERE MAY BE A NEED FOR ADJUSTMENT LATER ON THE NUMBER CAN. GO HIGHER LOWER. BUT WE'RE JUST STARTING THERE AS A STARTING PLACE -- I NOW WANT LIKE TO HEAR FROM OTHERS IN SUPPORT NAME ORGANIZATION THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME WITH THIS INTERNET [inaudible] MR.

I ALSO WANT TO THANK OUR REGULAR -- LOBBYIST FOR ALLOWING THEM TO SPEAK FIRST I THINK IT WAS VERY ELEGANT. AND I KNOW THEY'RE STILL CONCERNED ABOUT THE BILL SO IT'S TIME TO HEAR FROM THE OPPOSITION THANK YOU CHAIR QUIRK IN MEMBERS CINDY TECH WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES WE HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON AB. TWO SEVENTEEN AND WE SUBMITTED A LETTER YESTERDAY SO I KNOW SOME OF OUR CONCERNS ARE NEW. WE AGREE WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA OF THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM WE WANT THIS PROBLEM SOLVE THIS YEAR -- THERE IS A LOT OF AGREEMENT THIS YEAR ON ON THE ISSUE THE SUBJECT MATTER. PARDON ME MISTER CHAIRMAN -- CAN YOU ASK THE WITNESS TO JUST MOVE THE MICROPHONE CLOSER. TO THAT YEAH THANK YOU YOU KNOW WE CAN HEAR YOU BUT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE VIEWING THIS CANNOT SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH ORIGIN THANK YOU MADAM VICE CHAIR MISTER CHAIR ALONG THOSE LINES COULD. COULD YOU TODAY WITNESS RE -- IDENTIFY HERSELF SURE -- GOOD CINDY TOOK WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES. AND WHAT YOU CAN START FROM THE BEGINNING IF YOU WANT THEN YOU'LL GET THE WHOLE THING ON THE RECORD. I ONCE I'LL START TIME ME NOW OKAY. SO CINDY TOOK WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES WE HAVE AN OPPOSED TO LESS TO SIT ON OPPOSE A LIST AMENDED POSITION ON THE BILL. AND WE AGREE YOU WITH THE AUTHOR ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA THAT THERE IS A REAL PROBLEM AND THAT IT SHOULD BE SOLVE THIS YEAR AND I KNOW A LOT IF YOU WANT TO DO THAT AS WELL. OUR POSITION IS REALLY FOCUSED ON THE PART OF THE BILL THAT IS A NEW PROPOSAL IT'S A DIFFERENT VERSION OF A WATER TAX. THAT'S OUR MAJOR CONCERN ALL ELABORATE ON THAT IN A SECOND. BUT I I FIRST WANTED TO THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA FOR REALLY LISTENING TO STAKEHOLDERS THE MEETINGS THAT YOU REFERENCED EARLIER. ON BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN WILLING TO CONSIDER DIFFERENT IDEAS AND WE GREATLY APPRECIATE THAT. AND FOR EXAMPLE AWKWARD IN THE CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL UTILITIES ASSOCIATION ARE SPONSORING A BILL THIS YEAR SB SIX SIX NINE BY SENATOR CAFIERO WHICH WOULD CREATE THE SAFE DRINKING WATER TRUST. AND WIN THE AUTHOR LEARNED ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL HE WAS INTERESTED IN IT AND INCLUDED THE OF AN IDEA FOR THE TRUST IN THIS BILL SO WE GREATLY APPRECIATE THAT. THE WE THINK THE TRUST PROPOSAL COMPLIMENTS EXISTING FUNDS FEDERAL FUNDING AND BOND FUNDING IN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE AVAILABLE FOR CAPITAL COSTS. AND I THINK WITH THIS BILL IN IN LARGE PART IS AIMING TO DO IS FILL WHERE THERE'S REALLY A GAP IN THE ABILITY TO FUND THINGS AND THAT'S WE CALL IT THE TOUGH NUT TO CRACK IT'S THE OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE COSTS YOU CAN'T USE THE FEDERAL MONEY FOR THAT. YOU GENERALLY CAN'T USE BOND MONEY FOR THAT SO WORLD YOU KNOW TRYING TO SOLVE THAT PROBLEM. IN OUR VIEW THE TRUST IS INTENDED AS OF A MECHANISM TO REPLACE THE WATER TAX IT'S AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE WATER TAX WE WERE INTENDING TO ADD THAT TO THE WATER TAX. SO I I JUST WANTED. TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT WAS CLEAR FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE. CIVIC COREY OF OUR OPPOSITION AGAIN GOES TO THE WATER TAX PART OF THE BILL WE THINK IT'S NOT. GOOD POLICY FOR THE STATE TO TAX SOMETHING LIKE PEOPLE'S TAP WATER THAT IS ESSENTIAL TO LIFE. WE HAVE A HUMAN RIGHT TO WATER POLICY IN CALIFORNIA WHICH IS FOR SAFE WATER BUT IT'S ALSO FOR AFFORDABLE WATER. IN USING A TAX TO FUND A SAFE DRINKING WATER PROGRAM WILL ADD TO THE COST WATER ACROSS THE STATE IT WILL WORK AGAINST WATER AFFORDABILITY. THIS WOULD ALSO BE THE PRESIDENT FOR A STATE TAX ON WATER AND THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER -- INTO TEASE STATE AGENCIES THAT ARE ALREADY TALKING ABOUT IDEAS THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO FIND WITH ATTACKS ON WATER AND THIS WOULD BE THE PRESIDENT FOR THAT. NO THERE ARE SOME PROBLEMS WITH THE LANGUAGE WE OUTLINED SOME OF THOSE IN THE LETTER I'M NOT GONNA CUT TO EVERYONE THAT WE EXPLAINED IN THE LETTER BUT I'LL MENTION ONE OF THEM FOR EXAMPLE. THE BILL AS CURRENTLY AMENDED WOULD ALLOW THE USE OF FUNDING FOR SYSTEMS THAT HAVE SAFE DRINKING WATER. BUT THEIR RATES EXCEED A THRESHOLD IN A YOU WATER BOARD FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE DOCUMENT THAT THRESHOLD IS ONE POINT 5%. OF THE MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME. AND YOU HAVE THAT PROVISION IS WELL INTENDED. BUT AS WE SPEAK THE STATE WATER BOARD IS WORKING ON A A PROGRAM IT'S THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AB FOUR ONE BY A VENN ASSEMBLY MEMBER DIED NOW SENATOR DODD. WE HAD A MEETING AT THE WATER BOARD THAT WENT FROM NINE TO THREE ON FRIDAY ABOUT THIS. THE PROGRAM AT THE WATER BOARD. WOOD THE INTENT OF THAT IS TO END UP WITH A SUBSIDY FOR WATER CUSTOMERS AND IT WOULD SUBSIDIZE ABOUT A THIRD OF THE HOUSEHOLDS IN CALIFORNIA. SO THAT'S A PROGRAM THAT'S UNDER DEVELOPMENT RIGHT NOW WE SUGGEST THAT THIS PROGRAM THIS BILL FOCUS ON WHERE THERE ISN'T SAFE DRINKING WATER. SO THAT'S ONE SPECIFIC ISSUE -- JUST CUTTING TO THE CHASE AGAIN WE HAVE AN OPPOSED TO LESS AMENDED POSITION WE URGE A NO VOTE ON THE CURRENT VERSION OF THE BILL. BUT WE COULD SEE YOU TO WITH PARTS OF THIS IN THE TRUST AND OTHER THINGS A SOLUTION COMING TOGETHER. SO WE APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE'S WORK ON THIS STORY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISS TALK FOR YOUR ELOQUENT STATEMENT THANK YOU. AND AND THANK YOU FOR WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR. ALL RIGHT -- OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS CHASE AND I COULD WITH ADULTS TING GILBERT ROPES AND SPENT ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL UTILITIES ASSOCIATIONS IN YOUR WAY -- I WANNA BE CLEAR SEE MAYES LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE HAS YET TO CONSIDER THIS BUT WE DO NOT TECHNICALLY HAVE AND OPPOSE POSITION ON THE BILL THAT RESPECT FOR THIS COMMITTEE AND THE AUTHOR WE WANTED. TO EXPRESS OUR CONCERNS WITH CERTAIN PROVISIONS IN THE BILL IN PARTICULAR. MISS TUCKER ALREADY TOUCHED ON ON ON MANY OF THE ISSUES RELATED TO THE THE NEW FEE AUTHORITY FOR THE WATER BOARD IN THIS BILL. TO ALL OF SENIOR WAYS MEMBERS ARE PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITIES THEY'RE ALL SUBJECT TO PROPOSITION TWO EIGHTEEN WHICH MEANS THAT ANY FEES THAT IS ASSOCIATED. ON THE WATER AGENCIES THAT ARE MEMBERS OF SENIOR WAY WILL ULTIMATELY BE APPLIED TO ALL RATEPAYERS OF THOSE AGENCIES SO IT THIS ULTIMATELY IS A REGRESSIVE COSTS TO THOSE REPAIRS ARE MOST VULNERABLE THAT WE START. AND SO WE WE WE LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING A FOR FORMAL POSITION IN MORE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE AUTHOR WANTED TO NOTE THIS OKAY AND I PRETENDED YOU WERE SITTING UP HERE BECAUSE IT WAS STILL TIME FOR THE OPPOSITION TO SPEAK SO -- IT'S WELL UNDERSTOOD BUT NO ONE ELSE PLEASE REPEAT THE SAME POINTS BUT YEAH IF YOU WANT TO ADD. A POINT OR TWO WE HAVE ABOUT FORTY SECONDS LEFT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. AND JACK WALK ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF FRESNO -- CITY OF LONG BEACH -- KERN COUNTY WATER AGENCY SAN BERNADINO OF IT VALLEY MUNICIPAL WATER DISTRICT -- DOES ONE POINT I DID WANNA MAKE RELATIVE TO HOW MUCH MONEY'S ALL TO MCKINNEY NEED IT IS I THINK WE'VE GOT. TO HAVE A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF THE ESTIMATES VARY WIDELY BETWEEN WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE THE CASE WHICH IS IN THE THIRTY TO FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR RANGE AND THEN OF COURSE WE'VE HEARD. A HUNDRED FORTY MILLION DOLLARS WHICH DOES INCLUDE CAPITAL COST AND I THINK MISS TALK ELOQUENTLY AS YOU. POINTED OUT INDICATED THAT CAN BE FINANCED WITH BOND MONEY SO WE THINK THEIR ALTERNATIVES THERE AND I THINK WE BEFORE WITH THE LEGISLATURE LEAPS LET'S BE SURE WHAT THE WHAT THE SET OF NUMBERS REALLY -- SO YEAH AND THAT'LL WERE IN AND OUT IN GREAT DETAIL AND APPROPRIATIONS I ASSURE YOU WITH THE GUIDANCE FROM THIS COMMITTEE I TRUST -- TO THE EXTENT THAT WE HAVE EXPERTISE YES BUT IT'S SAD THIS IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT APPROPRIATIONS IS CASUALLY GOOD -- TO WAY WOULD BLOCK OUR STAFF IS ALWAYS AVAILABLE TO THEM. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT FROM NOW ON JUST NAME AND PUT OUR ORGANIZATION. NICKEL CAN UNITS ON BEHALF OF THE HOUSEHOLD AND COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS ASSOCIATION WE REPRESENT THE NON AGRICULTURAL FERTILIZER INDUSTRY AND WE'RE OPPOSE LAST AMENDED OCCUR DUE TO ADOPT THE LANGUAGE AND SB EIGHT FOUR FOUR LAST YEAR WHICH ASSESSES A LOWER MELISSA SMITH FOR THE NON COMMERCIAL FERTILIZER THANK YOU. THANK YOU. SARS DIVERSE WITH A MISSILE WATER DISTRICT OF ORANGE COUNTY HAS NOT HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO AGENDA IS THE BILL BUT DID TAKE A FORMAL POSITION OPPOSING THE TAX AS A MECHANISM A FUNDING THE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER CUSTOMER. LOOKING FOR TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR ON THE DETAILS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR IN THIRTY MILLION ON BEHALF OF MESA WATER DISTRICT WHICH YOU DO NOT HAVE AN OFFICIAL POSITION YET BUT AFTER THE SAME COMMENTS AS AQUA IN SENIOR THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MUNNINGS GREG MORRISON I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF ELSEWHERE VALLEY MUNICIPAL WATER DISTRICT IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. WERE PRACTICALLY 20% OF OUR MEMBERSHIP OUR OUR OUR CUSTOMERS ARE IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND SEVERELY DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND I WOULD SUBMIT TO YOU THAT EVEN A SMALL AMOUNT OF FIFTY CENTS IS A WATER TAX ON THEIR BILLS. WOULD SEVERELY IMPACT THEM AND WE'RE ALREADY TO A CERTAIN DEGREE SUBSIDIZING THOSE PARTICULAR RATE PAYERS WITH NON REPAIR MONEY THAT WE RECEIVE FROM PASSIVE INCOME IN THE AREA SO WE SUPPORT OCT WAS POSITION ON THIS BILL. AND LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. HOW ARE NOT TAKING TIME HERE FOR EAST VALLEY WATER DISTRICT -- WE ARE VIEWS ARE IN ALIGNMENT WITH -- THOSE EXPRESSED BY AQUA AND UNFORTUNATELY FIFTY CENTS MAY SEEM LIKE A SMALL AMOUNT BUT IT'S STILL A STARTER TAX ON WATER. THANK YOU. HI I'M A TWEENER BRIAN AND JACK IN BRIDGEWATER THIRTY NINE POSITION ON THE BILL LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHOR. WE HAVE A CONCERN WITH THE FEES ONE POINT THAT HASN'T BEEN RAISED IS. AMONG OUR LOW INCOME -- CUSTOMERS. WE'RE ABOUT 30% IN SACRAMENTO AREA. TWO MILLION PEOPLE THAT SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE. ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND OF THOSE DOT ACTUALLY DIRECTLY GET A BILL SO THERE'S AND CHALLENGE WITH US HELPING THEM OUT WITH THE OUTLOOK THE POINT OF THIS WAS THAT THEY WON'T HAVE TO BE. GETTING A BAIL. HE LOOKED IT'S DOUBLE THAT WE'VE HAD AND NOT TAKE UP ANYMORE THE TIMES OKAY TO GET IT RECOGNIZED THAT THERE'S GONNA BE A CHALLENGE REACHING THOSE CUSTOMERS AND HELPING THEM OUT WITHOUT WITH A P. A PROPOSED AT SUCH. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS ADAM ROBIN WITH THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WATER ASSOCIATION PROJECT CONVERSATION TODAY WE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE FEW LANGUAGE BUT WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S WILLINGNESS TO ENGAGE STAKEHOLDERS THROUGH INTER ON INTO THIS YEAR LOOK FOR TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON NO AUTOMATIC WITH THE CITY OF ROSE FILE. ASSOCIATE MY COMMENTS WITH THOSE OF CMU AND ARE A. AND JUST ADD THAT WHATEVER FEE THAT WE DO HAVE TO PAY AS A PUBLIC WATER SYSTEM WILL UNFORTUNATELY HAVE TO BE PASSED ON TO OUR CUSTOMERS. AND DISPROPORTIONATELY A FAX THOSE WHO CAN LEAST AFFORD IT. THANK YOU. THAT AFTERNOON CAROLYN JENSEN WITH KP PUBLIC AFFAIRS ON BEHALF OF WESTERN MUNICIPAL WATER DISTRICT WESTLANDS WATER DISTRICT IN THE MOJAVE WATER AGENCY -- WE ALIGN OURSELVES WITH THE COMMENTS OF AQUA AND OF REMAIN OPPOSED TO LET THE TAX ON WATER THANK YOU THANK YOU I THINK WE HAVE ALL THE WITNESSES YOU CAN STAY UP HERE MISS TALK AND I SHOULD ALSO GET AN EXPERT FROM THE PRO SIDE. UP HERE IN CASE THERE ARE TECHNICAL QUESTIONS TO BE ANSWERED I WONDER TWO OF YOU CAN COME UP THERE'S PLENTY OF SPACE. ALL RIGHT MISS BARRET ON HAS ASKED TO SPEAK FIRST -- BECAUSE SHE IS LEAVING SHORTLY TO PRESENT A BELL THANK YOU MISTER. CHAIR -- THANK YOU MR GARCIA FOR BRINGING. THE START TENSION I MEAN I THINK WE ALL WANT CALIFORNIANS TO HAVE SAFE AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER WITH A SHARED GOAL -- ONE QUICK ONE TECHNICAL QUESTION ON THE TRUST IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE LA -- PUT OUT A REPORT SAYING THAT THAT WOULD REQUIRE US TO PUT THREE TO FOUR BILLION DOLLARS OF GENERAL FUND MONEY AWAY FOR THE TRUST TO WORK IS THAT RIGHT. THAT IS CORRECT OKAY -- SO. I HAVE CONCERNS FIRST OF ALL THE YOUR BILL AND MISTER BLOOM SPELLER SEPARATE BECAUSE I THINK THAT. THE IDEA THAT THEY WOULD NOT BOTH COME TO BE LAW WOULD BE. SEVERELY PROBLEMATIC THE OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY IN MISTER BLOOM SPELL IS. I THINK NECESSARY TO THIS BILL AND SO I'D LIKE TO SEE THEM BECOME ONE BILL AND SO WE KNOW THAT THAT OVERSIGHT ACCOUNTABILITY WILL GO HAND IN HAND WITH THIS BILL BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT -- THIS DIMENSION WEEK. HE CAN CONSIDERED JOINING THE BELLS IRAQ IT'S GOOD FOR THEM TO BE SEPARATE BUT WE COULD JOIN THEM WE'LL SEE IF THAT HAPPENED OKAY [inaudible] AND I'M. SO ONE OF MY MAJOR CONCERNS WITH THIS IS THAT. THE UNCLEAN WATER IN MAJORITY OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE'RE FOCUSED ON IS THE RESULT OF POLLUTION. IS THE RESULT OF POLLUTION. DIRECT POLLUTION INTO OUR WATER SOURCES AND SECONDARILY RESULTING FROM DRAWING DOWN OUR GROUNDWATER TO SEVERELY. AND THE EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT WE DRAW DOWN THAT GROUND WATER THAN I TRADE BALANCE GETS OFF AND THAT'S PART OF THE PROBLEM IS HAPPENING HERE. SO IT IS ACTORS CAUSING THIS PROBLEM. AND SO ALTHOUGH. I WOULD YOU KNOW I WANT TO SEE CLEAN DRINKING WATER THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA I ALSO QUERY IS IT RIGHT TO HAVE THE RATE PAYERS A CALIFORNIA PAYING FOR THE ACTIONS. OF THE POLLUTERS AND SO I ALSO WONDER IF 30% IS THE RIGHT NUMBER -- IF WE REALLY LOOK AT WHAT ACTIONS ARE CAUSING THIS IS IT MORE THAN THAT AND I THINK WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THE RESPONSIBLE PARTIES ARE. BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS IN THAT THEY ARE -- THE ONES RESPONSIBLE TO CLEAN IT UP AND SECONDARILY I THINK WE NEED. TO I DON'T WANT US TO JUST BE CLEANING DRINKING WATER. LETTING PEOPLE POLLUTE AND CLEANING DRINKING WATER WE NEED TO ALSO BE WORKING TO STOP THE POLLUTION. SO THAT MOVING FORWARD WE HAVE LAST PROBLEMS WITH CLEAN DRINKING WATER. AND SO ALTHOUGH I UNDERSTAND RIGHT NOW WE HAVE TO CLEAN OUR WATER I ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE AS A COMMITTEE AND AS A BODY ARE LOOKING VERY HARD AT WHAT WE ARE DOING THAT IS CAUSING THIS PROBLEM IN THE FIRST PLACE AND GET TO THE ROOT. CAUSES AND WE'RE PASSING BILLS TO FIX THOSE PROBLEMS AS WELL. I'M. YOU KNOW I I HAVE TO COMMEND YOU AND TO SEE THE ENVIRONMENTALISTS AND THE GROWERS ON THE SAME SIDE IS PRETTY AWESOME SO -- YOU KNOW THAT'S GOOD TO SEE AND IT'S PART OF WITH MAKING ME. I'M MORE COMFORTABLE WITH US MOVING FORWARD IN THIS CONVERSATION BECAUSE I KNOW YOU'RE WORKING WITH ALL INTERESTED PARTIES TO MAKE SURE WE GET TO A PLACE. WHERE THIS BILL IS GOOD -- BUT I ALSO WANT TO ECHO MAKING SURE THAT AS WE HAD IF WE HAD TOWARDS APPROPRIATIONS THAT WE GET THE NUMBER RIGHT I MEAN WHEN I HEARD FROM THE CITY'S A MAYBE A THIRTY TO FIFTY MILLION BUT WE HAVE A HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION. AGAIN BACK TO THE ACCOUNTABILITY THAT WE ARE NOT OVER SUBSCRIBING HERE WE'RE REALLY USING THE BOND MONEY WHERE WE CAN. AND ONLY AND USING THESE FUNDS WHERE WE ACTUALLY NEED THEM FOR ON GOING. CLEANING -- SO THERE'S A LOT LEFT TO BE WORKED OUT. WHICH IS VERY CLEAR AND SO I THINK THAT YOU KNOW. I'M. I WANT IT TO BE CLEAR THAT ANY SUPPORT TODAY IS CONTINGENT ON THIS STUFF BEING WORKED OUT AND THEN WE GET TO A SOLUTION THAT LOOKS TO THE FUTURE OF CLEAN WATER IN A MUCH BROADER SENSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR STATEMENT AND BRINGING UP SOME VERY IMPORTANT ISSUES -- WOULD BE ALRIGHT IF THEY ANSWER THOSE IN THE CLOTHES. OKAY SO WILL TRY AND TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN -- ANSWER OUR QUESTIONS IN THE CLOTHES UNLESS IT'S A VERY BRIEF YES SIR NOW -- MISTER PETER DAHLE YACHT MR DARLING I THINK IS NEXT IN THE NOW I I JUST HAD A SUGAR IN A CLARIFICATION WHICH I HAD. I MEAN. I HAVE. MANY OF THE SAME QUESTIONS THAT. TO MS BAUER CAN HAS AND I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR THEM ADDRESSED AS PART THE CONVERSATION NOT JUST IN A CLOSE. ALL RIGHT THEN -- I'LL LOVE. I'LL I'LL YIELD TO THEN THE QUESTIONS BEING ANSWERED NOW. AND MISS POWER BEHIND WILL HAVE TO CATCH UP LATER -- CAN I ASK MY OKAY GO AHEAD. THEN. ASK YOUR QUESTION AND THEN WE'LL WE'LL LOT WILL GO ON TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ALL RIGHT. I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR MISTER DALI WELL FIRST OFF I WANT. TO LET THE AUTHOR KNOW IN THE IN THE PEOPLE THAT COME HERE TO SUPPORT THIS LEGISLATION IT'S BEEN ONGOING WE KNOW THAT THIS HAS BEEN THE ISSUE BUT I WANT TO POINT OUT SOME. SOME CLEAR FAX. SO I HEARD IN THE TESTIMONY THERE ARE MILLION -- RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA HAVE. AND SPIT DRINKING WATER AND THAT'S A FACT WE KNOW THAT THERE'S IS NITRATES AND AND THAT'S UNACCEPTABLE I AGREE WITH YOU ON THAT BUT THERE THIRTEEN EIGHT MILLION PEOPLE HAVE SAFE AFFORDABLE. SOMEWHAT AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER AND I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU ALSO THAT. WE HAVE PASSED A LOT OF LEGISLATION IN BONDS TO ADDRESS. THESE ISSUES I MEAN I CAN'T I SHOULD HAVE GOT A LIST OF SAFE DRINKING WATER BOND THE EIGHT PROPERTY FOR I CAN GO BACK TWENTY YEARS AND THE PUBLIC HAS BEEN PAYING. MAYBE NOT ON AN A ON A TAX ON WATER. BUT THEY'VE BEEN PAYING THROUGH BONDS WHICH IS THE COMES OUT THE GENERAL FUND WHICH IS PAID BY TAX DOLLARS. AND SO I'M SOMEWHAT FRUSTRATED WITH THE FACT THAT WE CONTINUE TO COME BACK AND AND FOR MAYBE IT'S JUST MAYBE FOLKS ON OUR SIDE OF THE AISLE THAT CONTINUALLY YOU ARE ASKED THE QUESTION IS. YES WE HAVE ISSUE BUT HOW DO WE SOLVE THAT ISSUE AND HOW DO WE ACTUALLY ADDRESS IT WITH. THE BEST AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY AND DROPPING THE RATE THIS IS THIS IS TALKING ABOUT TAXING EVERY SINGLE. TO ME DRINKS AND AND THE STATE THROUGH WATER SYSTEM THAT IS AN ALSO PRODUCERS LIKE MYSELF WHO USE FERTILIZERS I'M GONNA BE IT'S ALREADY TAX AND WE'RE GONNA ADD TO THAT TAX IN THIS LEGISLATION SO. IT'S GONNA BE VERY HARD FOR ME TO SWALLOW THIS KNOWING ALL THE WHILE THAT I'VE ACTUALLY RAN PIECES OF LEGISLATION. THE LOUD POINT OF USE. FILTRATION OF WATER AND THE BILLS GET KILLED.% BUT SOME OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS WHO ARE STANDING HERE SUPPORTING THIS TAX. WHEN I KNOW THAT THAT WOULD HELP ALLEVIATE SOME OF THE PROBLEMS AT THE SOURCE AT THEIR HOUSE TO GIVE SAFE DRINKING WATER? TO CONSTITUENTS IN CALIFORNIA THERE ARE HUNDRED AND FORTY IMPAIRED WATER SYSTEMS IN CALIFORNIA THAT I'M AWARE OF THAT THERE MAY BE MORE THAT ARE REALLY NEED. SOME FOLKS ON THAT'S WHAT WE SHOULD FOCUS. AND SO. AS SOMEBODY WHO HAS. BEEN TAXED A LOT IN THE STATE AND YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO LIVE IN THE STATE. QUITE FRANKLY WHEN EVERYTHING IS THE COST OF LIVING IS GOING UP. AND I JUST DON'T HAVE A A HIGH LEVEL OF TRUST FOR THE WATER BOARD. NUMBER ONE IN IMPLEMENTING WHATEVER PIECE OF LEGISLATION GETS PUSHED OUT. IN A FASHION THAT WILL ACTUALLY AFFECT THE THOSE THOSE CONSTITUENTS WHO NEED THEIR WATER SUPPORTED AND WE'VE SEEN THIS TIME AND TIME AGAIN WHERE WE'VE HAD. LEGISLATION THAT SUPPOSED TO FIX SOMETHING AND THE MONIES GET DIVERTED OFF INTO. ALL KINDS OF OTHER THINGS THAT NO FIX THE PROBLEM AND I'LL GIVE YOU TWO EXAMPLES THAT ARE JUST BLARING IN OUR FACE RIGHT NOW WE DID A THERE WAS A TAX FROM BATTERIES LAST YEAR FOR EXCITED MY GOOD FRIEND. CRISTINA GARCIA. WHO WORKED ON THAT LEGISLATION TO HELP OUR COMMUNITY WITH THE WITH THE THE? LEAD ISSUES LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED DTS TOOK THE MONEY AND EXPANDED THEIR OFFICES AND IS NOT GOING TO THE GROUND WHERE WE NEED TO FIX THE PROBLEM. SO I HAVE. VERY JUST A LOT OF DISTRUST FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO BE ABLE TO DO WHAT WE ASK THEM TO DO NUMBER TWO WE PASSED HEAVILY USED TRACKS ON TRUCKS. MANY MANY YEARS AGO TO FIX OUR ROADS. TO THE TUNE OF A BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. AND THAT MONEY GOT DIVERTED TO THE GENERAL FUND AND TO THIS DAY IS STILL CONCERT CONVERTED TO THE GENERAL FUND. IT IS NOT FIXING OUR ROADS AT THE SAME TIME CAME BACK TO US AND SAID WE NEED TO PASS A TAX FOR FUEL WE CAN FIX THE ROADS. SO I'M JUST I AND I KNOW THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO FIX A PROBLEM THAT IS IN YOUR DISTRICT BUT I JUST WANT TO SHARE WITH THE FRUSTRATION THAT. MANY FOLKS HAVE IN THIS BUILDING THAT JUST CAN'T JUST TRUST US THIS TIME. WELL I DON'T TRUST YOU THIS TIME BECAUSE I I HAVE A LIST OF TIMES THAT WE'VE BEEN TAX AND DRIVING UP THE COST TO CALIFORNIANS AND IT DOESN'T FIX THE PROBLEM. SO I COMMEND YOU FOR BRINGING UP FOR I KNOW IT'S A TOUGH ISSUE AND THERE ARE LOTS OF SPECIAL INTEREST EVERYWHERE OUT THERE BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY. WE WANT TO BUILD THE TRUST WITH THE PUBLIC OF CALIFORNIA WHEN WE'RE ASKING THEM TO PAY AGAIN. AND AGAIN AND AGAIN THE MONEY ACTUALLY FIXES THE PROBLEM AND IT AND WE FIX IT. SO THAT IT DOESN'T COST. MORE THAN IT SHOULD AND IT THERE'S BEEN SOME OBVIOUSLY MISSED TALKING SOME OF THE OTHER ONES HAD SUGGESTED THAT -- MAYBE WERE WERE GET WE'RE TAXING TOO MUCH FOR THE ACTUAL PROBLEM THAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED SO I SHARE THAT WITH YOU I'M GONNA HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME SUPPORTING ANY LEGISLATION UNLESS. THERE'S SOME SAFEGUARDS IN IT THAT SAYS. THIS IS WHERE IT'S GOING TO GO AND THIS IS HOW IT'S GONNA FACT BECAUSE THE TRACK RECORD OF THIS. LEGISLATURE AND THE PEOPLE WHO IMPLEMENT THE LAWS WE PASS IS HORRIBLE. SO IT'S NOTHING PERSONAL I AGREE WE NEED TO HAVE CLEAN SAFE DRINKING WATER BUT THERE THIRTY EIGHT MILLION PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO HAVE GOOD SAFE DRINKING WATER CALIFORNIA. THERE'S A MILLION IT DON'T LET'S FOCUS ON THOSE MILLION FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN GET THEM SAFE DRINKING WATER FOR THEIR FAMILIES THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR ALLEN -- SO. LOTS OF STATEMENTS. WHAT I'D LIKE? ARM. AT YOUR REQUEST IS TO RATHER THAN ADDRESSES IN THE CLOSE ADDRESS IT NOW ALSO SINCE YOU HAVE MANY OF THE SAME QUESTIONS. ARE WE CAN MAKE SURE THERE'S A ANSWERED -- AND WE CAN ALSO MAKE SURE THAT MR DOLLIES OUR QUESTIONS -- ARE ANSWERED SO. WE'LL START WITH YOU. YOU'RE WELCOME TO CALL ON YOUR EXPERTS AT THE END OF THAT I'M GONNA CALL ON MISS TALK IN SEE IF SHE HAS ANY QUESTIONS. I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE DISCUSS THIS FULLY NOW. WE'RE GONNA END UP TAKING MORE THAN AN HOUR ON THIS ITEM AND EVERY MINUTE IS IMPORTANT AND WORTH IT. AND THEN WE'LL GET TO THE OTHER QUESTIONS. BUT THIS IS IT. YOU KNOW IF WE STAY HERE LATE TONIGHT IT'S FINE BECAUSE THIS IS REALLY SO IMPORTANT TO US ALL. THANK YOU AS CHAIR LET ME UP ALL START WITH THE THE COMMENTS AND STATEMENTS MADE BY MY COLLEAGUE. A MISTER DALI IN I DON'T THE I DON'T DISAGREE. WITH THE THE COMMENTS THAT YOU MADE AS IT RELATES TO THE OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY. OF FUNDING STREAMS THAT ARE SAID TO DO ONE THING IN ULTIMATELY END UP. SOMEWHERE ELSE. I THINK THAT -- WITH THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION THERE HAS TO BE SOME DIRECT THE OVERSIGHT OF IDENTIFYING WHERE THESE COMMUNITIES ARE -- THE TYPES OF PROJECTS THAT ARE BEING PUT FORWARD THE COST -- THE TIME LINES AND OF COURSE THE BUDGETARY -- ALLOCATION. WITH THE FOLLOW UP AND FOLLOW THROUGH A NIGHT I'M GOING TO BE WORKING CLOSELY WITH MISTER BOWMAN. CAN WE PUT THESE BILLS TOGETHER ABSOLUTELY WE THINK THOUGH -- IT AT THE CURRENT TIME IT'S IT'S AN EASIER. TASK TO WORK ON THESE IN PARALLEL -- SO THAT WE CAN DEAL WITH THE RESPECT STAKEHOLDERS AS IT RELATES TO THE MECHANISM AND THEN OF COURSE THE ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION -- BUT I DON'T DISAGREE -- YOU GIVE A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF THE ISSUE RELATED TO ROAD INFRASTRUCTURE -- MONEY THAT WAS DEDICATED FOR ONE THING AND EVENTUALLY ENDED UP IN THE GENERAL FUND -- YOU OR I WERE HERE. MY AND SO WE CAN'T BE HELD RESPONSIBLE BUT WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR HOW. THIS NEW FREE ON GAS. IS UTILIZED FOR INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT AND THE VOTERS ALSO. HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO WEIGH IN ON THAT. AND THEY'RE SAYING WE TRUST YOU FOR NOW. AND STAY THE COURSE AS IT RELATES TO IMPROVING OUR ROADS AND INFRASTRUCTURE WITH THAT FEAT. THE VOTERS SPOKE -- AS IT RELATES TO THE EXCITED I THINK. THAT IS A GOOD EXTREMELY CONCERNING. AND I HAVE -- FULL CONFIDENCE IN -- MY COLLEAGUE -- CRISTINA GARCIA AND I WILL SUPPORTER -- TO TAKE THE OPIATE COURSE OF ACTION TO ENSURE THAT THAT MONEY ENDS UP WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE RIGHT. LET'S GET BACK TO THE SUBJECT AT HAND. YOU MENTIONED BONDS. WE KNOW THAT BONDS. ARE NOT ALLOWABLE FOR THE PURPOSE OF OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE. OF THIS PROBLEM. WHICH IS WHY IN ALL THE WE HAVEN'T TALKED A LOT ABOUT THIS CONSOLIDATION CONTINUES TO BE. A NUMBER ONE OPTION. AS IT RELATES TO THE SMALLER SYSTEMS THAT CAN NO LONGER BE SUSTAINED ON THEIR OWN. BUT THOSE LARGER SYSTEMS THAT WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR TAKING THE MON [inaudible] WE'LL NEED. TO HAVE SOME INCENTIVE. RIGHT SOME RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO TAKE ON THAT OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE COSTS. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS FUND FOCUSES ON SO I AM WITH YOU BY WE WERE THE AUTHOR OF THE LAST WATER PARK BOND. THAT. DIRECTED SOME MONEY FOR WATER INFRASTRUCTURE CLEAN WATER BEING ONE SECTION OF THE BILL BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH. THE PRIOR WATER BOND WASN'T EITHER. IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN THAT WAS SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS. THAT GOES TOWARDS INFRASTRUCTURE. IMPROVEMENTS AND NOT SO MUCH THE OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE THAT'S WHY WE ARE PROPOSING THE TWO QUARTER. PUBLIC FUND BENEFIT. FEE TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE -- THAT'S BEFORE US ALL TURNED TO TO OUR CALL THE GAL WHO. SAYS MANY OF HIS CONCERNS ARE ARE. DIRECTLY TIED TO HIS POWER CON AND THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE WERE THAT -- POLLUTERS SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE I THINK THE WATER BOARD IS DOING THAT. YOU CAN TELL ME IF I'M WRONG -- IT THE WATER BOARD IS ON TOP OF THIS ISSUE COULD THEY DO MORE MOST DEFINITELY. AND THE REASON WHY I THINK. THE AG COMMUNITY IS AT THE TABLE WITH US IS BECAUSE THE WATER BOARD IS THREATENING TO DO MORE. AS IT RELATES TO HOLDING THEM ACCOUNTABLE. SO -- I'M APPRECIATIVE OF THE FACT THAT WE ARE APPROACHING THIS IN A COLLABORATIVE WAY. AND WHETHER OR NOT. YOU KNOW AG OR ANY OTHER INDUSTRY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR A PORTION -- THE NUMBER WAS 30% IF IT'S MORE THAN IT SHOULD BE REFLECTED IN THE AMOUNT THAT'S BEING PUT ON THEM TO BE ABLE TO CLEAN THIS UP BUT BUT ULTIMATELY. YOU KNOW I WANT TO SAY THAT I DON'T DISAGREE WITH THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE. AND THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF THAT CONVERSATION TODAY WE HAVE HANDFUL OF AMENDMENTS THAT WE HAVE ACCEPTED -- TO THEN MOVE ON TO IDENTIFYING THE ACTUAL. AMOUNT. OF THE PROBLEM AND ULTIMATELY HAVE APPROPRIATIONS. HELP US BEGIN NARROWING DOWN THE SCULPTOR -- BUT THE COMMENTS ARE WELL TAKEN WELL NOTED AND AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER. ON WE ARE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH EVERYONE WHO HAS STOOD UP IN OPPOSITION. TO THIS BILL AND I KNOW THAT. YOU KNOW WE'VE HAD SOME WATER AGENCIES. WHO WILL GO ON NAME WHO HAVE COME TO MEET WITH US AND HAVE PUT FORWARD SOME IDEAS SOME SOLUTIONS AS IT RELATES TO MECHANISMS ON HOW TO ADMINISTER? COLLECTED AND SEND THE FEEDBACK. TO THE STATE IN ORDER FOR IT TO END UP IN THE FUN -- TO CLEAN UP THESE WATER SYSTEMS IN SPECIFIC PARTS OF THE STATE SO WE ARE. HEARING YOU LOUD AND CLEAR. AND YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN MENTIONED THIS IS A CONTROVERSIAL OR OR A TOUGH ISSUE. IT SHOULDN'T BE. THE IDEA THAT THERE ARE CHILDREN IN SCHOOLS -- THAT DON'T HAVE CLEAN DRINKING WATER THAT SHOULD NOT BE CONTROVERSIAL OR A TOUGH ISSUE. WHEN WE USE THE WORD TAX OF COURSE IT SCARES US IN? FOLKS -- ON WHETHER OR NOT THE WE CAN SUPPORT THIS OR NOT THIS IS A OF FEET. TO BENEFIT THE PUBLIC. RIGHT AND THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TAX AND AND THE FEE THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. TAXES FOR GENERAL SERVICES A FEES WERE SPECIFICALLY. ADDRESSING A SPECIFIC NEED IN AREAS WHERE PEOPLE ARE PAYING THE FEE AND IT'S VERY DIFFICULT. FOR SOMEONE TO SAY I DON'T HAVE THIS PROBLEM IN MY DISTRICT I KNOW -- THERE ARE. STANDARDS. THAT TO CONTINUE TO BE ELEVATED AT THE WATER BOARD. THAT ARE PUTTING SYSTEMS OUT OF COMPLIANCE EVERY SINGLE DAY. AND THAT REQUIRES. RESOURCES TO BUILD THE ADEQUATE INFRASTRUCTURE AND TECHNOLOGY. AND MAYBE IT'S THE TEMPORARY APPROACH OF USING POINT OF USE FILTRATION SYSTEMS AS WE DO IN. THE COACHELLA VALLEY TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF ARSENIC. BUT THE LONG TERM SOLUTION IS TO CONNECT THEM TO CENTRALIZE INFRASTRUCTURE. SO THAT EVERYONE. IS DRINKING THE SAME QUALITY OF WATER THAT STUFF BEING SUPERVISED AND MAINTAIN. OUR BY THE PROFESSIONAL SO -- MANY STATEMENTS WERE MADE THEY WERE IN A LOT OF QUESTIONS OR STATEMENTS THAT WERE MADE IN I WANTED TO ADDRESS THOSE STATEMENTS. IN SUCH WAY AND AGAIN INVITE. YOU. TO GET INVOLVED IN THIS CONVERSATION -- BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS A YEAR THAT WE MUST SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. OKAY -- MISSED MURATSUCHI THERE IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WOULD REQUIRE ADDITIONAL -- CLARIFICATION ON YES I HAVE A SERIES OF QUESTIONS ALL RIGHT I I FORGOT I WAS GONNA LET MISS TALK. A RESPONDED CASE YOU HAD -- UGH JUST BRIEFLY -- IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WOULD LIKE TO RESPOND -- TO YES ON JUST A FEW THINGS. ON BONDS OF COURSE PROP ONE TWENTY FOURTEEN HAD OVER HALF A BILLION FOR SAFE AND CLEAN WATER. THE MOST RECENT BOND -- TWENTY FROM JUNE OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN WITH PROP SIXTY EIGHT THAT INCLUDED AN ADDITIONAL TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION FOR SAFE AND CLEAN WATER AGAIN AVAILABLE FOR CAPITAL NOT -- FOR IN THEM. ON THE POLLUTION ISSUE THAT WAS RAISED EARLIER WE A 100% AGREE THAT RESPONSIBLE PARTY SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE YOU KNOW FOR POLLUTION. ON THE TRUST ISSUE OF THE NUMBER OF A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION CAME UP EARLIER I AM THAT WAS A NEW NUMBER TO ME. LAST YEAR THE NUMBER WAS A HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION I THINK THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WAS TRYING TO RAISE BUT REGARDLESS. AS OUR MISTER KWOK WHO TESTIFIED THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENCES ON THE MONEY THAT WILL BE DISCUSSED AT APPROPRIATIONS. BUT WHEN YOU LOOKED AT THE MOST RECENT NEEDS ASSESSMENT THAT THE STATE WATER BOARD IS ISSUED -- FOR IN M. FOR NITRATE AND OTHER CHEMICALS IT WAS FORTY THREE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS YOU ADD MONEY FOR CONSOLIDATION MAYBE YOU GET TO FIFTY MILLION -- THAT TRANSLATES TO A TRUST OF ABOUT ONE POINT THREE BILLION THAT COULD BE FUNDED OVER ONE TWO OR THREE YEARS FOR EXAMPLE SUGGESTIVE GET THAT INFORMATION OUT THERE. AND FINALLY. THE WAY THE NEW ON THE BE MECHANISM THAT'S BEEN REFERRED TO IS WRITTEN IT IS A TAX UNDER PROP WENTY SIX YES -- VERY GOOD AND THANK YOU FOR BRINGING UP YOUR NUMBERS AGAIN -- THAT WILL BE DETERMINED IN APPROPRIATIONS ARE WE JUST LOOKING AT POLICY HERE -- SO MISTER MURATSUCHI I BELIEVE YOU HAVE SOME QUESTIONS YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH IDEA. BUT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS COMMITTEE DOES ITS JOB OF FULLY VETTING THE POLICY BE RATHER THAN JUST RUBBER STAMPING A WORKS FOR ME YES THANK YOU. SO FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO MAKE IT ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THAT AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED IT'S NOT CONTROVERSIAL. THAT WE SHOULD HAVE SAFE DRINKING WATER FOR ALL SO THE QUESTION IS HOW DO WE GET THERE -- AND ON ON THE ISSUE OF THE WATER FEE OR THE WATER TAX OUR WE MAY CALL IT -- I'M NOT AFRAID OF VOTING FOR A TAX OF VOTED FOR TAXES BEFORE. I WANT TO MAKE SURE HOWEVER THAT THE THAT THE COSTS ARE A RELIABLE -- THERE I AM HEARING TESTIMONY THAT THE NUMBERS. THERE THERE SEEM TO BE SOME DIFFERENCES IN TERMS OF THE AMOUNT. NEEDED INTO THAT THE DOLLARS ARE WELL SPENT. YOU KNOW ALONG THE LINES OF WHETHER THE DOLLARS ARE WELL SPENT I I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH THE AS BARRACK QUE AND THAT -- THAT THAT WE SHOULD BE ASKING RATE PAYERS AND TAXPAYERS TO PAY FOR POLLUTERS. POLLUTERS IF THERE IF THERE THE PROBLEM THEN THEY NEED TO PAY. IF THEY IF THEY SHOULD BE PAYING MORE THAN THAN THAN THIS BILL SHOULD BE MAKING THEM PAY MORE. I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT RATE PAYERS AND TAXPAYERS ARE NOT SUBSIDIZING BAD BEHAVIOR SO. WAIT WAIT WITH THOSE. BASIC -- CONCERNS IN MIND AND ON OUR SIDE SKEWS ME I HAVE TO PRESENT A BILL -- THE VICE CHAIR IS VERY EXPERIENCED IN -- SITTING IN FOR ME. ALL RIGHT BUT I KNOW THAT WE'RE GOING TO HEAR EVERYONE'S QUESTIONS AND I'LL BE BACK AS QUICK AS I CAN. SO MR GARCIA. BY ON THE BASIC PRINCIPLE OF MAKING SURE THAT THE POLLUTERS PAY. YEAH YOU YOU RESPONDED THAT TO THAT THE WATER BOWL BOARD IS HOLDING THE POLLUTERS ACCOUNTABLE BUT HOW. YOU KNOW WHY GIVE ME A COULD YOU OF THE ELABORATE ON THAT YEAH WE WE HAVE -- THEY ARE THE REGULATORS. AND WE PASSED POLICY THAT THEN THEY IMPLEMENT. RIGHT AND SO THEY ARE -- RESPONSIBLE DIRECTLY FOR REGULATING -- SYSTEMS AND OR INDUSTRIES. THAT ARE OUT OF STATE COMPLIANCE REGULATIONS -- THAT'S THE THE BASES OF MY MY STATEMENT. BUT TO CAN THE QUESTION. IF IT IS FOUND -- THAT -- POLLUTERS. ARE CONTRIBUTING TO THE PROBLEM FAR GREATER THAN WHAT WE ARE ESTIMATED IN THIS BILL THEN THIS BILL OUGHT TO REFLECT THAT. THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT OKAY -- SO ALONG THOSE LINES I MEAN I I I I I AM ALL FOR WHAT I'M HEARING IS THAT THE WATER BOARD. IS IS REGULATING AN AND IMPOSING FINES OR PENALTIES WHEN THERE ARE NOT. IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE REGULATIONS BUT WE WE HERE ARE ARE FACED WITH THE THE ISSUE OF WHO'S GOING TO PAY -- PRIMARILY FOR THE OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE A TO ENSURE A SAFE DRINKING WATER FOR ALL AND SO YOU KNOW THAT'S WERE. I I AM NOT HEARING -- AND AND AND AND IF I'M MISSING SOMETHING I ASKING TO HELP ME OUT HERE BUT I'M NOT. HEARING HOW THE WATER BOARD ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES ARE GOING TO HELP PAY. FOR THE OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE COSTS OF INSURING SAFE DRINKING WATER FOR ALL. SO THE WAY THIS BILL IS BROKEN DOWN IS THAT. THERE WILL BE AGRICULTURE FEES FERTILIZER FEES DAIRY FEES. THERE'S A REQUEST OF TWO HUNDRED MILLION FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS TO BE PUT IN THE FUND SIMILAR TO THE AQUA -- CONCEPT OF PROPOSAL AND WE'RE ASKING THAT THERE BE A FEE -- THAT IS A SERVICE CONNECTION FOR YOU ON A MONTHLY BASIS ON ON WATER AGENCIES A TO BE ABLE TO THEN GENERATE. THE ULTIMATE GOAL WHICH I STAND CORRECTED CONTINUES TO BE ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION DOLLARS. TOM. COULD THE NUMBER CHANGE IT COULD FROM NOW. TO THE APPROPRIATIONS BASED ON ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FROM THE WATER BOARD. THAT THERE MAY BE OTHER SYSTEMS AND OTHER PLACES OF THE STATE -- THAT NEED TO BE INCORPORATED INTO THIS EQUATION THIS IS BASED ON THE MOST RECENT AND AVAILABLE INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE -- AKA REPRESENTATIVE HAS MENTIONED THAT THE ESTIMATE AT ONE POINT WAS IN THE FORTY FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS CONSIDERING THE CLEAN UP OF NITRATES -- AND THE CONSOLIDATION -- WHAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE IS THAT -- NOT EVERYONE HERE NOT EVERYONE IN CALIFORNIA IS FACING THE SAME PROBLEM WITH NITRATES -- THERE ARE SCHOOLS IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF CALIFORNIA THAT FACE THE PROBLEM OF LET. THERE ARE OTHER RURAL COMMUNITIES THAT DON'T FACE THE ISSUE OF NITRATES BUT HAVE HIGH LEVELS OF ARSENIC AND CHROMIUM. SIX AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IF WE'RE ASKING. ALL CALIFORNIANS TO PITCH IN TO THIS PROBLEM. THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAP INTO THIS FUN. AND ADDRESS THEIR CLEAN WATER PROBLEMS IN THEIR OWN BACKYARD. OKAY SO ALONG THAT POINT THE DO YOU HAVE. DATA INDICATING WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THESE -- NOW. OPERATIONAL MAINTENANCE COSTS ARE AND ACT AND IN AN AGRICULTURAL AREAS VERSUS URBAN AREAS. I DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION ON ME I I DON'T HAVE THAT OKAY THAT WE WILL FOLLOW UP ON ALL RIGHT SO -- BAG I I I APPRECIATE. TO YOU KNOW -- YOU YOU TOLD ME THAT THIS IS A AN ONGOING GO A PROJECT IN AND AND I WILL RESPECT THAT -- BUT THAT'S GOING TO BE ONE OF THE THE THE THE QUESTIONS THAT I'M GOING TO BE LOOKING. FOR IS -- YOU KNOW I MEAN I I I SHARE SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT MR DOLLY HAS I WANT TO I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE THOSE DOLLARS ARE BEING WELL SPENT THAT IT'S NOT JUST. TO A POLITICAL PITCH TO THROW IN LA COUNTY AND AND TALK ABOUT HOW THIS IS URBAN PROBLEM RATHER THAN JUST ROLL PROBLEM. OF BECAUSE YOU KNOW. AGAIN I I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM IN IN VOTING FOR ATTACKS IF IF IF FIND. IN A SURE THAT THOSE DOLLARS COULD BE WELL SPENT -- THE SO SO YOU KNOW IN IN IN IN IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE THAT POLLUTERS PAY A MEANING. I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH WITH JACKING UP WHAT YOU'RE PROPOSING FOR FOR THE YOU KNOW FOR THE FOR THE FOR THE DAIRY FOR THE FERTILIZER FOR FOR AGRICULTURE. IF THAT'S GOING TO YOU KNOW MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE I I THINK THAT'S THE THE THE THE THE DRIVING PRINCIPLE THERE ARE ARE THEY BEING ASKED TO TO PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE -- SO THAT AGAIN RATE PAYERS AND TAXPAYERS ARE. ARE ARE ARE NOT YOU KNOW. PAYING FOR THE POLLUTERS AND THAT THAT'S ANOTHER QUESTION THAT I'M GOING TO BE LOOKING -- FOR AS AS AS I'M GOING TO AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD -- I TALKED ABOUT -- HOW I GOT A -- BE LOOKING -- FOR YOU KNOW MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE A RELIABLE SET OF COSTS THAT. TO THAT AND THAT THIS BILL IS IS IS BEING BASED ON AND I'M YOU KNOW I I I WANT TO SHARE -- THE CONCERNS OF IT MISS TALK IN IN TERMS OF THIS BEING A PRECEDENT I MEAN IT IT IT BOTHERS ME THAT WE'RE AT YOUR SETTING A PRECEDENT THAT WE'RE GONNA BE TAXING WATER -- AND AND THAT'S WHY AGAIN I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW THEY THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS BILL. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE DOLLARS ARE BASED ON SOLID NUMBERS -- AND THAT AGAIN -- WHERE WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT TO PAYING FOR THE POLLUTERS -- SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE PRINCIPLES THAT I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR THANK YOU THANK YOU. OKAY A SETTLEMENT -- HOLD HOLDEN HAS SOME QUESTIONS I BELIEVE DID YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO ADD MISTER GARCIA BEFORE ONE OF OUR ONE OF OUR WITNESSES WANTED TO KINDA OKAY I I'M SORRY MR HOME WOULD YOU MIND HOLDING ON AND LETTING HER DRESS SOME OF THOSE THANK YOU. THE MANAGER. I LIKE TO JUST ADD I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE UNDERSTAND THAT DRINKING WATER CONTAMINATION HAS A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT CONTAMINANTS. AND I WILL SAY THE FACT THAT WE'RE ALREADY THINKING ABOUT -- TAXING AGRICULTURE AND THERE AT THE TABLE THEY RECOGNIZE THEY'VE CONTRIBUTED TO CONTAMINATION. AND THEY WANT TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION WHICH IS REALLY HISTORIC. AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT AND THE CONTAMINANT THAT'S PART PRIMARILY A BIGGEST SOURCE OF CONTAMINATION FROM THE INDUSTRY IS NITRATES. NOW THAT SAID NEDRY DOES NOT THE ONLY CONTAMINANT THAT WERE FACED WITH SO SOME OF THOSE FEES A WILL COME FROM THE INDUSTRY WILL HELP. SOLVE THE STE THE PROBLEM WHERE WE DO HAVE NITRATES. THE REALITY IS THAT AS WAS MENTIONED BY OUR ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA IS WE HAVE OTHER CONTAMINANTS THAT WE ALSO HAVE TO ADDRESS. SUCH AS ARSENIC ONE TWO THREE T. C. P. URANIUM BACTERIA PER GLORIA IT GOES ON AND ON AND ON AND FOR THOSE CONTAMINANTS WE TO FIGURE OUT A SUSTAINABLE SOURCE OF FUNDING. FOR THE OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE MAINTENANCE OF THIS CONTENT ARE THESE CONTAMINANTS. AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT YES WE PASSED A LOT OF FUN A BOND FUNDING BUT NONE OF IT GOES TOWARDS THE BIGGEST GAP WHICH IS OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE AND THIS IS WHAT THIS BILL WILL HELP ACHIEVE. I ALSO JUST WANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT AS WE TALK ABOUT SHORT TERM SOLUTIONS LIKE THESE POINT OF USE DEVICES. I'M VERY CAUTIOUS WITH THAT BECAUSE WHEN YOU INSTALL A FILTER IN SOMEONE'S HOME. YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT PERSONS MAINTAINING THE FILTER BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T MAINTAIN THOSE FILTERS THE FILTRATION DEVICES IT ACTUALLY INCREASES THE CONCENTRATION. NOW I WILL SAY THAT WERE ACTUALLY TESTING SOME PRIVATE WELLS AND THE CENTRAL COAST AND I'M SEEN SIX TIMES THE LEVEL OF NIGHT TREATS THAT ARE THAT ARE LIMITED IN OUR DRINKING WATER. THERE'S CLEARLY NO CERTIFIED DEVICE TO REDUCE THAT LEVEL OF CONTAMINATION. THERE'S OTHER LOCATIONS WHERE WE HAVE MULTIPLE CONTAMINANTS LIKE PER GLORIA AND NITRATES THERE'S NO SOARED BY POINT OF USE THAT I KNOW OF THAT CAN ACTUALLY REDUCE THAT LEVEL OF CONCENTRATION NOW I JUST WANT TO SAY. THAT IN ADDITION TO THAT WE ALSO HAVE THE NEED GAS -- CLINICS WERE MEMBERS GOAL IN THE CLINICS IN THEIR WATER FOUNTAINS. WE HAD TO INSTALL A POINT OF USED DEVICE BECAUSE WE HAD ARSENIC SO YOU GO TO THE DOCTOR TO GET BETTER BUT THE FOUNTAIN AT THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE HAS ARSENIC. THESE ARE THE CONDITIONS THAT I GOT TO SAY WERE ALSO VERY FRUSTRATED WITH AND SOME OF OUR MEMBERS ARE PAYING SOME OF THE HIGHEST WATER RATES FOR TOXIC WATER OVER EIGHTY DOLLARS A MONTH. AND ON TOP OF THE HAVE TO BUY BOTTLED WATER SO I JUST WANT TO REMIND US THAT THE REALITY RIGHT NOW WE HAVE PLENTY OF STUDIES THAT SHOW WHERE WE HAVE THE PROBLEM. AND THIS FUND WILL ALSO INCLUDE PRIVATE WELLS WHEREAS I BELIEVE THE TRUST DOESN'T INCLUDE THAT AND WE HAVE MANY WELL THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THAT ALSO NEED THIS ASSISTANCE IT'S NOT JUST ONLY PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS BUT ALSO INDIVIDUAL PRIVATE WELL OWNERS ARE IN THE SAME RISK OF MAKING SURE THAT THEY HAVE SAFE DRINKING WATER. OKAY I'M BACK -- WHERE ARE WE NOW WHO IS? MR HOLDING THIS UP. WELCOME BACK THANK YOU. IT WAS AN EASY BILL THANK GOD. NOT LIKE THIS. ONE A FIRST FOR MY MY QUESTION IS MORE OF A CLARIFYING QUESTION BUT LET ME BEFORE I ASKED THAT QUESTION -- LET ME JUST STATE FOR THE RECORD THAT -- I KNOW THAT THE AUTHOR TO BE A VERY A CONSUMMATE Là -- LAWMAKER AND A VERY DILIGENT IN TERMS OF PUTTING THE PIECES TOGETHER WHEN I HEARD. OF THE THE OPPONENTS OR THOSE WHO HAD. QUESTIONS ABOUT THE BILL OF THEIR STILL POSITION THEMSELVES IN A POSITION OF WORKING WITH YOU SO THEY HAVE NOT AS SER GONE -- YOU KNOW TO THE HARDCORE NO AND AND I THINK THAT IS A TESTAMENT OF UNDERSTANDING HOW YOU'RE WILLING TO TAKE WHAT IS A VERY -- A BIG BILL AND AND TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL THE PIECES COME TOGETHER AND AND THEY MAKE SENSE -- AND SO -- HI I WOULD LIE MYSELF A LOT OF THE QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN ASKED WHICH YOU'VE ALREADY INDICATED -- OR IN YOUR WILL HOUSE TO TRY TO GET. OF THE ANSWERS. TO MY MY QUESTION IS A AS A CO AUTHOR. OF CERTAINLY -- ALIGN MYSELF WITH THE INCREDIBLE BENEFITS THAT THIS BILL IS DESIGNED TO ACCOMPLISH. WHAT I WANTED TO DO WAS -- IN THE MANY ANALYSIS. WHERE IT IS ON PAGE TWELVE REFERRING TO POTENTIAL AMENDMENTS I THINK THAT SHE EVER? REFERRED TO IT EARLIER -- WE'RE DESCRIBES -- THE BILL COULD BE AMENDED TO IMPOSE A FIFTY CENT. OF PER CONNECTION FEE ON ALL PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS AND REQUIRE ALL PUBLIC. WATER SYSTEMS TO REMIT THE FEE TO THE STATE WATER BOARD. OF IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE PUBLIC WATER. SYSTEM INCLUDES WHOLESALERS AND I'M I'M WONDERING IF THIS CREATES A POTENTIAL FOR A RATE PAYERS. TO BE -- HAVE A FEE OPPOSE TWICE AS TO IF IF THE WHOLESALERS AND RETAILERS FALL UNDER. OF THIS -- STATE WATER BOARD OUR SYSTEM OF WHAT IS IT THE INTENTION. OF THE BILL -- TO HAVE THE FEE APPLY TO RETAILERS AND WHOLESALERS. BUT ONE TIME. RIGHT NOW OKAY TWICE. IT'S A WILL MAKE SURE THAT THAT IS MADE VERY CLEAR. IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE BILL OKAY. THAT'S THAT'S WHY I WANT TO CLEAR THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THAT UP THANK. VERY GOOD THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION -- WOULD ANYONE ELSE LIKE TO YES MADAM VICE CHAIR THANK YOU AND THE LAST ONE I THINK THAT HAS A SPOKESMAN EXCEPT FOR MISTER BLOOM EVER THERE -- SO THINK WE'LL GET HISTORY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN -- SO A COUPLE OF POINTS THAT I WANT TO MAKE -- I YOU KNOW I HAVE TO AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE. THAT MENTIONED THAT WE HAVE ALREADY TAKEN A NUMBER OF STEPS -- TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S ADEQUATE CLEAN DRINKING WATER FOR CALIFORNIANS IN. SOME OF THE BALLOT MEASURES THAT HAVE BEEN PASSED -- WE JUST. WITH THAT LAST YEAR WE JUST PASSED THE BILL THAT WOULD ALLOW SOME OF THESE WATER -- DISTRICTS TO BE CONSOLIDATED IF THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO PROVIDE CLEAN DRINKING WATER SINCE THAT TIME SINCE THE BILL WAS PASSED. ONE HAS BEEN CONSOLIDATED. THAT'S IT SO WHEN ASSEMBLYMAN DOLLY SUGGEST THAT HE HAS A MISTRUST OF HOW THIS PROCESS IS GOING TO PLAY OUT I HAVE TO AGREE AND I THINK EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM SHOULD BE A LITTLE SUSPECT. OF YOU KNOW I MIGHT START OFF WITH GREAT INTENTIONS BUT IN THE END DOES IT TURN OUT THE WAY WE EXPECTED -- THERE'S DISCUSSION ABOUT IS THAT IT IS A TAX IS A FEE -- IT'S A TAX. IT'S A TAX IN AND I AND I DON'T KNOW HOW. THIS MAY PLAY OUT ON THE COURT I DON'T KNOW WATER IS IN THIS IS IT IS A HUMAN RIGHT. RIGHT DON'T WE WE AGREE ON THAT WATER IS A RIGHT SO I DON'T. I'M HAVING A HARD TIME RATIONALIZING THIS IN MY HEAD HOW WE'RE GOING TO TAX SOMETHING THAT IS A RIGHT -- HOW THAT THAT'S NOT UNCONSTITUTIONAL -- WHICH IS SOMETHING I'M SURE YOU'VE CONTEMPLATED AND I'M SURE YOU'VE HEARD THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS BUT I WILL TELL YOU FROM MY OWN PERSPECTIVE. EVEN NOW I'M SURE YOU MAY ASSUME THAT JUST BECAUSE I'M A REPUBLICAN EVERY TIME I HEAR THE WORD TAX THAT. YOU KNOW MY BLOOD STARTS TO CURL THAT'S NOT TRUE BUT I WILL TELL YOU THAT AS A AS A AS A SOMEONE WHO FEELS IT'S HER OBLIGATION IN YOURS. TO DEFEND THE TAXPAYERS MONEY I THINK WE NEED TO TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY AS TO WHETHER OR NOT IT'S TAX -- FEE AND NOT GET BATTLE AND LET THE COURTS DECIDE WHAT THE INTENT WAS AND WHAT THIS ACTUALLY IS [inaudible] I'M. I MEAN ASK YOU STRAIGHT OUT. BECAUSE I HAVE HEARD RUMORS IN THEY MAY JUST BE THAT RUMORS BUT I HAVE HEARD RUMORS THAT. AT SOME POINT. THIS BILL IS GOING TO CHANGE AND SOMETHING WILL BE INSERTED THAT WILL EXEMPT -- LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS FROM PAYING THIS TAX OR FEE WHICH EVERYONE A COLLEGE IS THAT YOUR INTENTION. SO WE HAVE EVERY INTENTION TO MAKE SURE THAT IF THERE ARE MECHANISMS. THE WEEK IN INTEGRATE INTO THE BILL TO PROTECT DOLE'S. WHO COULD LEAST AFFORD TO PAY? WHAT DO SO AND WILL USE POVERTY LINE? UP PERCENTAGES RIGHT UP BUT I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT. THE PEOPLE THAT YOU HEARD FROM TODAY IN THAT CATEGORY -- AS IT RELATES -- TO INCOME LEVELS. AND THEY'RE HERE SAYING THAT WE'RE PAYING A LOT OF MONEY ALREADY. FOR DIRTY WATER. AND WE DON'T MIND PAYING TWO QUARTERS -- IF THE GOVERNOR DOES HIS PART AND PUTS DOWN THE BIG DOWN PAYMENT. AND THEN INDUSTRY. DOES THEIR PART AND PAY THOSE FEES. OF THAT THEY DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT BUT I GUESS. TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION IT'S NOT A RUMOR WE ARE EXPLORING -- LANGUAGE MECHANISMS THAT WOULD CREATE AN OPPORTUNITY TO PROTECT US CERTAIN POPULATIONS ARE FROM DOING SO NOT ONE I ALSO WANT TO MAKE JUST THE DRAW. CORRELATION BETWEEN -- FEES THAT WE PAY IN OUR ELECTRICAL BILLS. THAT GO TO A PUBLIC BENEFIT FUND. AT THE P. YOU SEE. THAT OLD TIMIDLY GO BACK TO COMMUNITIES TO ESTABLISH LOW INCOME RATE PROGRAMS AND OTHER TYPES OF PUBLIC BENEFIT. SERVICES AND PROGRAMS AND SO THE IDEA THAT THERE'S PRESIDENT BEING SAID IS NOT EXACTLY ACCURATE. WHEN IT COMES TO A FUNDAMENTAL AND BASIC -- UTILITY -- THAT WE ALL NEED AS WELL PERHAPS WATER. FALLS HIGHER THAN THE POWER CONVERSATION BUT THIRD IN MANY WAYS ONE IN THE SAME WHEN IT COMES TO ESSENTIAL. OF AMENITIES -- THAT WE NEED -- SO -- THE ANSWER'S YES WE ARE LOOKING AT IT AND WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT WE COULD GET SOME LANGUAGE THAT WILL BE. INTEGRATED THERE BUT I DO WANT TO REMIND YOU THAT THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE. WHO COME IN SUPPORT THIS BILL ARE THE PEOPLE THAT -- ARE SAYING WE DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM PAYING FOR THIS -- AND WE'RE THE ONES THAT ARE GOING TO BE DIRECTLY IMPACTED IN MR GARCIA JUST TO BE CLEAR -- MANY OF THE PEOPLE ON FOR INSTANCE IN TULARE AND AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY WHO ARE IN SUPPORT OF PAYING THIS EXTRA TAX -- WE ARE RECOGNIZING OF COURSE THAT THERE ARE SO MANY OTHERS THAT ARE IN A WELL SYSTEM THE WOULD NOT BE PAYING THAT TAX CORRECT. SO THE WAY I BELIEVE -- AND IT WAS JUST MENTIONED THAT THE FUND THE TRUST FUND DOES ACTUALLY INCORPORATE -- WELLS -- BUT YEAH NEEDS THAT I GRADED IN THE AMENDMENT YOU'VE TAKEN. DOES NOT INCLUDE PAYMENTS FOR WELL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT I'M ACTIONS ONLY. YOU'RE TALKING THAT CONNECTS RIGHT ONLY WELLS ARE NOT CONNECTED BUT THEY WILL BENEFIT BUT THEY BUT THEY WON'T BE PAYING BUT THEY WON'T BE PAYING BUT TELL. OKAY I JUST WANT TO BE CLEARER ABOUT. OKAY THANK YOU MISTER. BUT I DID WANT TO MENTION BECAUSE IT'S BEEN BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION THAT THE CONSOLIDATION REQUIRES RESOURCES. RIGHT. YOU NEED THE RESOURCES TO CONSOLIDATE THE SYSTEMS AND SO THE FACT THAT THERE'VE BEEN. JUST. ONE TELLS US THAT THE NOW WE HAVE THE PROBLEM. AND THIS IS TRYING TO ADDRESS THAT DIRECTLY. OKAY CAN I TAKE THAT IS YOUR CLOSE I THINK WE'VE WE'VE DONE ALL WE CAN. YES SIR RESPECT YES FREE I'VE OPENED OUR EYES WERE MATTER -- MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL -- WE MEDIA MOTION -- OF HOLDEN. SECOND BLOOM OKAY. THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR PATIENCE.

I I WANT -- TO AS MANY OF YOU DID ACKNOWLEDGE -- THE FOLKS WHO WERE HERE ADVOCATING ON THIS BILL I THINK IT'S A GOOD WAY TO BEGIN WE HAVE THIS ISSUE LAST WEEK. IN BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE THREE AND I CAN TELL YOU THERE WERE PROBABLY FIVE TIMES AS MANY PEOPLE HERE. MOST OF THEM FROM THE SAME COMMUNITIES THAT WERE THAT WERE REPRESENTED HERE THIS MORNING THE AND I I TELL YOU THAT BECAUSE SOME. I WANT YOU TO KNOW HOW INTENSE THE INTEREST IS IN RESOLVING THIS ISSUE. I'VE ONLY BEEN INVOLVED FOR ABOUT THREE YEARS -- WHEN SENATOR MINING -- CAME TO ME A COUPLE YEARS AGO AND SOUGHT TO A TO TO WORK TOGETHER -- IN IN THE FIRST YEAR WE WEREN'T ABLE TO MAKE PROGRESS LAST YEAR IT WAS IT WAS IN THE BUDGET WE SPENT A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF TIME -- TRYING TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AND OF COURSE HERE WE ARE AGAIN HAVING. BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL LAST YEAR -- WE'RE DEALING WITH THE SAME. OR SIMILAR STRUCTURE -- EIGHT AND AND WE ARE STUCK IN MORE OR LESS THE SAME PLACES SOMETHING HAS TO GIVE. THE PROPOSAL THAT YOU HEARD FROM ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA IS A THOUGHTFUL AND ROBUST. ONE ON THAT DOES ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF THE FAILING WATER SYSTEMS THAT WE HAVE AROUND THE STATE THIS HAS TRULY HOW BAD YOU ADDRESS YOUR BILL YEAH I'M GETTING THERE SENATE RIGHT IT'S THE NEXT PARAGRAPH SIR. SAME WE DID WE GET HERE NINETY MINUTES ON THAT [inaudible] ONE HI. A WHAT MISS OPEN THE ROLE REAL QUICK SO I COULD VOTE ON THAT LAST BILL AND I HAVE A SURE THING. THEY HANDED HER MY FOR INDULGING ME -- MADAM SECRETARY -- PLEASE CALL OKAY I'M CALLING THE ROLE ON ITEM ONE AB TWO SEVENTEEN EDUARDO GARCIA. OF THE VOTE IS NOW AT FOUR ZERO DALLI. DALLIS AND NOW. AND MATHIS. MATHIS NOW [inaudible] THANK YOU. OKAY SCENARIO -- MISSED MISTER CHAIR A AB TWENTY TWO SEVENTEEN CREATES THE FUNDING STREAM AND A. B.. ONE THIRTY FOUR ACCOMPLISHES THE GOAL OF FOR A OF MAKING SURE THAT WE ENSURE THAT THE FUNDS ARE SPENT TRANSPARENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY. THE BILL IS PRETTY SIMPLE -- AND STATES THAT IF AND WHEN A SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER FUND IS ESTABLISHED. THE MONEY IN THE FUND SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO TO REQUIREMENTS ONE THAT THE FUNDING BE DISPLAYED IN THE ANNUAL GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. INCLUDING REVENUES EXPENDITURES AND FUND BALANCES AND TO THAT EVERY FIVE YEARS THE LA -- WILL PROVIDE AN ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF EXPENDITURES MANY EXISTING WATER SYSTEMS DID NOT HAVE THE TECHNICAL -- DO NOT HAVE THE TECHNICAL OR FINANCIAL CAPACITY TO ADDRESS THEIR ONGOING COSTS -- AND THAT WAS A SUBSTANTIAL FACTOR IN THEIR ULTIMATE FAILURE HAVING A FUNDING SOURCE THAT PROVIDES CONTINUITY IS IMPORTANT BUT WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE. THAT AS WE DISTRIBUTE FUNDING WE VALUE GOVERNANCE AND LONG TERM SUSTAINABILITY. OF US SOME OF THAT IS ADDRESSED IN AB TWO SEVENTEEN AND HAS BEEN A FOCUS OF MANY OTHER LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS. TO CONSOLIDATE SMALL SYSTEMS AND IN SOME INSTANCES -- WITH ME TOO MANAGERIAL THE INTERVENED AND FAILING SYSTEMS. SO -- WE WANT TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES IN AB ONE THIRTY FOUR AND GIVE THE LEGISLATURE SOME CERTAINTY THAT THE MONEY WILL BE SPENT. JUDICIOUSLY AND EFFECTIVELY AS HAS ALREADY BEEN PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED WITH ME HERE TODAY ARE JENNIFER CLEARING FROM CLEAN WATER ACTION. I THINK I SAW JONATHAN NELSON OF COMMUNITY WATER CENTER AND PHOEBE SETON OF THE LEADERSHIP COUNCIL. JENNIFER CLARY CLEAN WATER ACTION AND I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT BILL I'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR SIXTEEN YEARS NOW. AND THE ONE THING THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO COUNT ON IN TRYING TO GET ACCESS TO SAFE DRINKING WATER FOR COMMUNITIES IS THE SUPPORT OF THE LEGISLATURE. I KNOW PERFECTLY WELL WHAT A DYSFUNCTIONAL AGENCY LOOKS LIKE THAT'S WHY THE DRINKING WATERPROGRAMS THAT THE STATE WATER BOARD AND IN THE FOUR AND A HALF YEARS IT'S BEEN THERE WE'VE MADE GREAT STRIDES. AND SO HAVING ACCOUNTABILITY HERE HAVING THE LEGISLATURE REMAIN PART OF THE SOLUTION IF YOU AS YOU HAVE BEEN FOR SO LONG IS USUALLY IMPORTANT AND THAT'S WHY WE SUPPORT THE BILL. THANK YOU. YEAH I AM. I I CAN'T JONATHAN OUT SO I COULD TAKE OVER HIS FIVE MINUTES IS JUST GETTING CHAIR OF PVC IN LEADERSHIP COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY.

HE SAID GO AHEAD AB SEVENTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT TO A MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS REGULATIONS THAT WERE ENACTED IN TWENTY FOURTEEN TO MINIMIZE HARM FROM ONE SUBSET OF RODENTICIDE ITS. SECOND GENERATION ANTI COAGULANT WROTE DOWN THE SIDES. HAVE PROVEN INEFFECTIVE AS NECROPSY DATA PERFORMED BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE AND OTHER SCIENTISTS HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT UNNECESSARY POISONINGS CONTINUE TO POSE A SIGNIFICANT THREAT. TO WILDLIFE AND PATHS. THE USER BROKE DOWN THE SIDES BY LICENSE PEST CONTROL APPLICATORS TO STILL ALLOW RODENTS TO CONSUMER DATA SITES. AND THEN -- THEY IN TURN POISON UPPER LEVEL PREDATORS WHICH RESULTS IN CONTINUED DEATHS OF WILDLIFE AND PATS. POISONINGS AND DEATHS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE BEEN DOCUMENTED IN NUMEROUS SPECIES SUCH AS EAGLES HAWKS FALCONS OWLS BOBCATS. MOUNTAIN LIONS AND EVEN THE IMPERILED SAN JOAQUIN KIT FOX AND NORTHERN SPOTTED OWL THE PROBLEM IS SO SEVERE THAT OVER CALIFORNIA -- WAS SHOWN TO HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO RODENTICIDE. AND RODENTICIDE ALSO POSE A RISK TO CHILDREN PETS AND DOMESTIC ANIMALS. IN FACT MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED PETS NEEDLESSLY DIE EACH YEAR DUE TO RODENTICIDE EXPOSURE. AB SEVENTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT SIX TO TAKE STRONGER MEASURES TO PROTECT CHILDREN PETS AND WILDLIFE FROM UNINTENTIONAL RODENTICIDE POISONING BY BANNING THE USE AND SALE OF SECOND GENERATION. ANTI COAGULANT RODENTICIDE STATE WIDE AND THE USE OF FIRST GENERATION ANTI COAGULANT RODENTICIDE ON STATE OWNED PROPERTY. NEW ENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE AND MORE HUMANE. MEANS OF CONTROLLING RODENT POULATIONS ARE INCREASINGLY BEING DEVELOPED AND SUCCESSFULLY USED BY THE PEST MANAGEMENT INDUSTRY WHICH OFFERS US HOPE FOR THE FUTURE. YET ACCORDING TO RESEARCHERS AT UCLA VIRTUALLY EVERY MOUNTAIN LION -- THAT UCLA AND AND PS HAVE TESTED AND 90% OF THE BOBCATS TESTED FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA HAVE TESTED POSITIVE FOR ANTI COAGULANT RODENTICIDE. POST FOR BOTH FIRST AND SECOND GENERATION. RODENTICIDE THAT KILLED SEVERAL OF AN ALREADY STRUGGLING POPULATION OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA MOUNTAIN LIONS. GIVEN THE OVERWHELMING HARM POSED BY RODENTICIDE AND THE AVAILABILITY OF COST EFFECTIVE ALTERNATIVES. THESE POISONS SHOULD BE BETTER REGULATED. WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOUR STAFF AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE. TO INFLUENCE HER TO TESTIFY. NOW WITH THIS IS A TWO MINUTES EACH. THANK YOU. MY NAME IS DOCTOR STEPHANIE LEWIS I AM A FULL TIME WILDLIFE AND A MERION AT THE CALIFORNIA WILDLIFE CENTER IN CALABASAS. I RECEIVED MY VETERINARY DEGREE AND COMPLETED A SPECIALTY INTERNSHIP AND WILDLIFE MEDICINE AT TUFTS UNIVERSITY. THE CALIFORNIA WILDLIFE CENTER RECEIVES OVER FOUR THOUSAND PATIENTS EACH YEAR ALL OF THEM SICK INJURED OR ORPHANED WILDLIFE NATIVE TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. OVER JUST THE PAST TWELVE MONTHS WE'VE TREATED AT LEAST ELEVEN PATIENTS SUFFER SUFFERING FROM SECONDARY ANTI COAGULANT RODENTICIDE TALK TO CLOSE THIS. AND OVER THE COURSE OF MY CAREER AS A VETERINARIAN AS A WILDLIFE REHABILITATION -- I'VE TREATED MANY MORE ANIMALS BOTH WILD AND DOMESTIC IMPACTED BY THESE POISONS. THE EFFECTS OF ANTI COAGULANT ARE INSIDIOUS. ANIMALS AFFECTED SLOWLY LOSE BUT THEY'RE A SMALL WOUND OR INTO AN ORGAN OR BODY CAVITY. SICK WILDLIFE TEND TO HIDE IN ORDER TO PROTECT THEMSELVES WHICH MEANS THAT THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS ACTUALLY MAKE IT TO MY EXAM TABLE LIKELY FAR UNDERESTIMATES HOW MANY. ARE SUFFERING FROM THESE POISONS IN THE WILD. I ALMOST ALL I ALSO ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY SEE ANIMALS A VERY LATE IN THE COURSE OF THEIR ILLNESS. THE LAST PIECE I RELEASE WAS AN ADULT RED SHOULDERED HAWKS WHO HAD LOST OVER 80% OF HER RED BLOOD CELLS THROUGH A LACERATION ON A TOE THAT WAS LESS THAN FIVE MILLIMETERS LONG. ONCE YOU PRESENTED TO ME SHE WAS TOO WEAK TO STAND OR EVEN OVER OPEN OUR EYES. SADLY IN MY EXPERIENCE AT LEAST HALF -- TO OVER 80% OF BIRDS OF PREY WITH SECONDARY A. R. TALK THE CLOSEST DIE WITHIN THE FIRST TWENTY FOUR HOURS A PRESENTATION. BEFORE MY VITAMIN K. THERAPY HAS HAD TIME TO COUNTERACT THE POISON AND RESTORE CAN THE STATE'S US. I'VE SEEN ANIMALS BLEED INTO THEIR LUNGS CAUSING VERY SEVERE DISTRESS AS WELL INTO THEIR BRAINS HER EYES JOINTS AND MUSCLES CAUSING SEVERE PAIN AND PERMANENT DISABILITIES. HOWEVER THE FULL EXTENT TO WHICH THIS POISON HAS IMPACTED WILDLIFE IS LIKELY UNDERESTIMATED. WHAT KIND OF WAR SUCH AS BOBCATS MOUNTAIN LIONS ARE SUBJECT TO CHRONIC LONG TERM SUB LEGAL EXPOSURE TO A VARIETY OF ANTICOAGULANTS? AND THIS IS BELIEVED TO ALTERED GENE EXPRESSION AND THE MUSE SYSTEM HEALTH. RESEARCHER IN WILD FIELDS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BY DOCTOR SOUTH RILEY AND OTHERS OVER THE PAST DECADE HAVE DETERMINED A LINK BETWEEN ANTI COAGULANT RODENTICIDE EXPOSURE AND NO TO EITHER MEANS A PARASITIC DISEASE THAT PREVIOUSLY HAD RARELY CAUSE MORTALITY ANY SPECIES. IN. TWO THOUSAND FOUR YOUR NUMBER WITH. DO YOU HAVE ANOTHER WITNESS SIR YES -- WE PROBABLY SHOULD GIVE TIME TO THE OTHER WITNESS -- YOU'VE USED UP TWO MINUTES AND SIXTEEN SECONDS PERHAPS YOU CAN JUST SUMMARIZE YOUR CONCLUSIONS. I'M SURE -- SO AT NEW AGAIN AS A DOCTOR. AS THAT MR BLUEBERRY SAID -- THAT DIED OF SEVERE MAIN HAD A OUR EXPOSURE -- AND THE LOSS OF THESE APEX PREDATORS IS RECOGNIZED BY BIOLOGIST HAVE A CASCADE EFFECT THAT CAUSES WIDESPREAD DESTRUCTION OF ECOSYSTEMS AND THIS CAN LEAD TO CHANGES IN EDUCATION WILD FIRE FREQUENCY INFECTIOUS DISEASES INVASIVE SPECIES AND WATER QUALITY -- AGAIN THE THE THE EXPOSURE FREQUENT WILDLIFE IS IF WE WE WE HAVE TO LEAVE SOME TIME FOR THE OTHER WITNESS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF COMMITTEE MY NAME IS JONATHAN EVANS I AM THE ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH LEGAL DIRECTOR WITH THE CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY. ALSO A MEMBER OF THE DEPARTMENT OF PESTICIDE REGULATION SPECIFIED MANAGEMENT VISOR COMMITTEE. MUCH OF MY CAREER HAS BEEN FOCUSED ON REDUCING THE HARM TO WILDLIFE -- FROM -- FROM PESTICIDES AND IN PARTICULAR SECOND GENERATION ANTICOAGULANT WERE DONE A SIDES ARE THE MOST DEVASTATING PESTICIDE FOR CALIFORNIA'S MOST ICONIC. WILDLIFE SUCH AS MOUNTAIN LIONS BOBCATS SANDWICH CAM K&lt;c.cyan&gt; BOXES&lt;/c&gt; PACIFIC FISHER'S. THERE BEEN A NUMBER OF INCREMENTAL STEPS TO REDUCE THE HARM OF THE BIRD AND ITS SIDES IN PARTICULAR THE SECOND GENERATION ANTI GOING OVER IN A SIZE THAT ARE THE TARGET. OF THIS BILL BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PESTICIDE REGULATION AND EPA BECAUSE THEY RECOGNIZE THE SEVERE HARM OF THESE PRODUCTS. UNFORTUNATELY WE'RE STILL SEEING INCREDIBLY WIDESPREAD EXPOSURE AND INDEED DIRECT MORTALITY AND LEAVE THE MORTALITY OF A LOT OF DIFFERENT WILDLIFE SPECIES. THE BILL BEFORE US TODAY AB SEVENTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT AS A MUCH CLEANER MORE EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE STRATEGY THAN ANY OF THE REGULATORY STEP THAT COULD BE TAKEN. DPR RECENTLY OPENED UP THE REEVALUATION PROCESS BECAUSE OF THE HARM A SECOND GENERATION AND I QUITE OVER IN THE SIDES. UNFORTUNATELY THE PAST TRACK RECORD IN IMPLEMENTING RESTRICTIONS. ON A TENANT TO FOURTEEN YOUR SCALE FOR THESE TYPES OF RED AND SIDES REALLY WILL NOT MINIMIZE THE HARM OF THESE PRODUCTS IN THE SHORT TERM. THERE ARE RANGE OF SAFE COUGHED COST EFFECTIVE. TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX. THERE ARE OVER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DIFFERENT TYPES OF RENDON ASIDES THAT AREN'T COVERED UNDER THE SPELL OF SECOND GENERATION AND ITS. SECOND GENERATION AND ACQUIRED OR ASIDES THAT ARE AVAILABLE FOR USE IN CALIFORNIA TODAY WON'T BE AFFECTED BY THIS BILL THIS BILL IS NARROWLY TARGETED ON THE MOST TOXIC READINESS SIDES. AND HAS CLEAN EXEMPTIONS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH -- PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT AND CALIFORNIA'S AGRICULTURAL ECONOMY. SECOND GENERATION AND I IF YOU COULD JUST SUMMARIZE CERTAINLY I WILL JUST AGAIN PUT FORWARD THE NUMBERS FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT ASIDE REGULATION WHILE THE SECOND GENERATION ANTICOAGULANTS. ARE ONLY THE SMALLEST PERCENTAGE OF YOU SUPPORT ON THE SIDES THEY HAVE THE GREATEST HARM NON ANTI COAGULANT ACUTE TALKS AGAINST. REPRESENTS. DRAMATICALLY MORE USAGE BUT ARE GETTING INTO THE SYSTEM THEIR OTHER TOLD UNTIL BOX THAT WON'T BE AFFECTED BY THIS BILL I GRITTED POSSIBLE TODAY THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT OUR OTHERS IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M LISA OWNS VIANI WITH RAPTORS ARE THE SOLUTION WE HAVE A STRONG. FIFTEEN COALITIONS IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL THANK YOU.

DR PETRA MARCIA NORTH A CALIFORNIA VETERINARIAN IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. FANA TOMLINSON PROJECT KOTV IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT UP OPPOSITION -- LET'S SEE WE'VE GOT. HOW MANY DO WE HAVE THAT WE HAVE TO ALL RIGHT YOU -- YOU MAY ALL. OF THREE WILL STILL HAVE PLENTY OF CHAIRS IF YOU WANT TO COME UP AND IF YOU WANT TO SPEAK. MORE THAN JUST -- YOUR NAME AND IF YOU WANNA. MAKE A COMMENT YOU HAVE FOUR MINUTES TOTAL BETWEEN THE THREE OF YOU. SO. WHO WOULD LIKE TO START? IF I MAKE GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY MY NAME IS JAMES STATE. AND I OWN A LOCAL PEST CONTROL COMPANY HERE IN THE SACRAMENTO AREA. AND WE EMPLOY ABOUT THIRTY PEOPLE AND HAVE ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND CUSTOMERS. I ALSO COME TO YOU TODAY AS THE PRESIDENT OF THE PEST CONTROL OPERATORS OF CALIFORNIA. WE REPRESENT A THOUSAND COMPANIES WHO EMPLOY OVER TEN THOUSAND TECHNICIANS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND IN SHORT WHEN YOU HAVE RATS WHERE THE PEOPLE THAT YOU CALL. WHETHER IT'S HERE IN YOUR HOMES BUSINESSES EVEN IN THE STATE CAPITAL. WE COME HERE TODAY ACTUALLY IN SUPPORT OF THE INTENT OF THE BILL WE BELIEVE THAT THE PROBLEM WITH WILDLIFE. IS. FOR REAL AND SERIOUS WE ONLY HAVE ISSUE WITH THE PROPOSED -- STRATEGY FOR ADDRESSING THAT. THE BACKBONE OF OUR STRATEGY IS TO CONTROL RODENTS WITH AYE PM WE START WITH EXCLUSION. WITH HABITAT MODIFICATION. AND MAKING SURE THAT SANITATION IS PROPERLY MANAGED SO THAT WE DON'T ATTRACT RODENTS TO OUR HOMES AND SCHOOLS AND HOSPITALS. WE USE OUR EMPLOY RODENTICIDE ONLY WHERE NECESSARY IN FACT. IT'S AXIOMATIC THE LESS RODENTICIDE SO THAT WE USE THE MORE MONEY WE MAKE SO WE DON'T LIKE. TO EMPLOY THEM UNLESS WE ABSOLUTELY NEED. TO THE STEWARDSHIP OVER IT AND SIDES IS VERY IMPORTANT TO OUR INDUSTRY. IN FACT IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN P. C. O. C. LAUNCHED THE WEST COAST ROAD AND ACADEMY IN DIRECT RESPONSE TO THE PROBLEM OF RODENTICIDE IN WILDLIFE. THIS IS A THREE DAY ACADEMY WHERE WE BRING IN TECHNICIANS. AND TRAINERS. AND WE TRAIN THEM. TO APPROACH. RODENT PROBLEMS WITH IBM. AND IT'S A ACADEMY THAT INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT I'M SORRY YES THAT'S A GREAT IDEA. SO THIS IS YOU HAVE TEN SECONDS. SORRY WELL I I WOULD JUST LIKE IT'S SO IT JUST FLIES RIGHT I HAD IT DOES. SO. WE ARE VERY ENCOURAGED THAT THE P. R. HAS OPENED THE REEVALUATION HOWEVER THIS ISSUE IS DIRECTLY CONNECTED TO PUBLIC HEALTH. AND WE'RE VERY CONCERNED THAT WHATEVER SOLUTIONS WE EMPLOY PUBLIC HEALTH MUST BE CONSIDERED IN FACT. EVEN NOW WE HAVE ISSUES A PUBLIC HEALTH THAT HAVE EMERGED LAST YEAR YEAH I GOT TO GIVE SOME TIME TO THE OTHER WITNESSES HELLO YOU CAN THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS JOSH BENSINGER ON THE PLASTER COUNTY AGRICULTURAL COMMISSIONER ON BEHALF OF HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURAL COMMISSIONERS AND SEALERS ASSOCIATION. WE'VE ALSO RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF PROTECTING WILDLIFE AND NOW WE WE AS AGRICULTURAL COMMISSIONERS IN -- ENACT DEEP YARDS PESTICIDE REGULATIONS ON THE GROUND IN EACH OF OUR FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES RESPECTIVELY WE ALSO GET THE REPORTS FROM THE APARTMENT FISH AND WILDLIFE WHEN PESTICIDE POISONINGS OCCURRED WHERE WERE AWARE OF WHAT A SERIOUS ISSUE THAT IS. WE CURRENTLY HAVE AN OPPOSE POSITION ON THIS BILL DUE TO THE WAY IN WHICH THE AGRICULTURAL COMMISSIONER IS TASKED WITH THE ROLE THAT IS NOT CONSISTENT. WITH OUR CURRENT -- REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND THE WAY THAT WE IMPLEMENT A PESTICIDE USE ENFORCEMENT PUTS US IN MORE OF A DECISION MAKING ROLL OVER THE USE OF PESTICIDES RATHER THAN IN A ROLE IN WHICH WE ARE EVALUATING AND REGULATING THE SAFE AND LEGAL USE OF THOSE PESTICIDES. THANK YOU OUR NEXT WITNESS MY NAME'S DARREN VAN STEENWIJK I AM ALSO A LOCAL OPERATOR. IN THIS ACKERMAN AREA -- ONE OF THE ENCOURAGING THINGS THAT THE DVR HAS DONE IS THAT THEY'VE ALREADY REACHED OUT TO US WITH A TO START THE CONVERSATION ON WHAT THEY CALL AN ARM PERMIT CONDITIONS WHICH ARE. A CENTURY ESSENTIALLY A TEMPORARY MEDICATION -- THAT WOULD BE ENACTED WHILE THE A RE EVALUATION IS CURRENTLY HAPPENING -- THE DPR HAS A HAS A WIDE VARIETY OF QUESTIONS -- THAT THEY'RE LOOKING TO ANSWER ME P. ARTISTS ARE DEPARTMENT PASSED AT REGULATION AT ALL I APOLOGIZE -- THAT DAY I THAT THEY'RE LOOKING TO ANSWER AS PART OF THEIR REVALUATION -- ONE OF THE BIG QUESTIONS THAT'S OUT THERE IS THE IDEA OF THE SPECIFIC PATHWAY OF OF THESE -- ACTIVES FROM A A FROM POINT A INTO THE INTO THE WILDLIFE BECAUSE TO THE DEPARTMENT PASSED AT REGULATION -- IT DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH DATA TO DETERMINE EXACTLY WHERE THAT POINT A IS AND WHERE IT STARTING -- AND SO THERE -- THEY OF LOOKED AT THE WHITE A WIDE VARIETY OF DATA GAPS -- THAT THEY WANT -- TO FILL IN AS AS PART OF THEIR RE EVALUATION -- AND WILL BE -- WILL BE WORKING VERY DILIGENTLY TO TO FILL IN THE DATA GAPS TO CREATE THE MOST APPROPRIATE -- AND COMPREHENSIVE OF MEDICATION -- THAT THEY FEEL IS NECESSARY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. LOCAL COMMUNITY ON BEHALF OF THE HOUSEHOLD AND COMMERCIAL pAGREE RELY LIKE TO ALLOW THE REEVALUATION PROCESS TO PLAY OUT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE LARA KNOWING HE CHECK ON BEHALF OF RISE IN WESTERN PLAN HEALTH ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION SIMILAR TO THE DPR SHE'LL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS DON KEPT YOUR BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION SEEMS HERE AGREES WITH COMMENTS BEING THANK YOU THANK YOU. ELEONORA CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WE STILLER POSE BUT APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS THAT MR MISTAKEN. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN CAPULETS REPRESENTING ANIMAL PEST MANAGEMENT SERVICES IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS. AS THE MEMBER SHRINK AWAY WE CAN. RIGHT GO AHEAD. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- MISTER A BLOOM BY -- APPRECIATE WE TRY TO DO BECAUSE YEAH I'VE BEEN TRYING. TO BASSAM PESTICIDES IN OTHER -- CONTEXTS ALSO BUT COME. COULD YOU JUST ADDRESS THE THE THE ISSUE. THIS IS A COMMON ARGUMENT THAT I GET FACED WITH ONE IN MY EFFORTS YOU KNOW. WHY WE SHOULD PROCEED WHEN THEY DEPARTMENT A PASS FOR PESTICIDE REGULATION IS? IS A JUST ANNOUNCED THAT THEY'RE GOING TO ENTER INTO A REEVALUATION. THAT PROCESS IS LIKELY TO TAKE A NUMBER OF YEARS WE HAVE A PROBLEM -- THAT IS GROWING FROM THE THE USE OF OF THESE ANTI COAGULANT AND WE NEED TO ACT NOW AND WE CAN CERTAINLY -- LOOK AT THE A INFORMATION AND DETERMINATION OF DPR WHEN THAT IS AVAILABLE BUT IT'S REALLY A AT AN UNCERTAIN AND UNCERTAIN TIME RIGHT NOW. SO SO IN OTHER WORDS WHILE WE OFTEN HEAR THAT WE SHOULD. TO LET THE SCIENCE -- PREVAIL -- SOMETIMES WE CAN'T WAIT FOR THE SCIENCE. OR AT LEAST WHAT I WERE. WE'RE ACTING ON SCIENCE NOW -- THIS IS A VERY MUCH A SCIENCE BASED BILL -- IN FACT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS ISSUE. FOR THREE YEARS FOUR YEARS NOW WE HAVE FOUR FINGERS -- FROM MY CHIEF OF STAFF -- I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS ISSUE FOR FOUR YEARS. AND ALL OF OUR EFFORTS HAVE BEEN BASED ON A SCIENTIFIC REPORTS FROM THE CROPS THESE -- AND FROM A VERY CAREFUL EVALUATION OF WHAT TO THE CAUSE OF BEEN AND DURING THAT PERIOD OF TIME -- WE'VE DEALT WITH A FIRST GENERATION AND AND AND NOW SEEKING. TO WORK ON SECOND GENERATION ANTICOAGULANTS -- BUT THE ISSUE AND THE PROBLEM WAS CONTINUED TO FESTER AND GROW. ALRIGHT THANK YOU. VERY MUCH. OF MADAM VICE CHAIR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN OKAY SO I'VE GOT A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS FOR YOU YOU GUYS -- YOU SAID THAT YOU YOUR ISSUES WITH THE STRATEGY. WHAT DID I HEAR THAT CORRECTLY? THE YEAH JUST THAT'S CORRECT SO THE BILL AS IT'S WRITTEN REQUIRES TO AGENCIES TO SIGN OFF BEFORE -- THESE RED INSIDES ARE EMPLOYED IN CERTAIN CONDITIONS. AND THAT'S THE THE COUNTY COMMISSIONERS AND ALSO THE PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCY. AND SO OUR CONCERN IS THAT NEITHER OF THESE AGENCIES. ARE -- THEY DON'T HAVE THE LANGUAGE THAT THEY NEED TO MAKE THE DETERMINATION. THEY DON'T HAVE THE STAFF THEY NEED TO MEET THE VOLUME BECAUSE THEY'RE COULD LITERALLY BE HUNDREDS OF CALLS PER DAY AT LEAST PER WEEK. AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE FUNDING FOR THE STAFF THAT WOULD THEY WOULD NEED FOR THE INCREASE OF THIS AND THAT'S WHY I SUSPECT THAT THE THAT THE AG COMMISSIONERS ARE HERE WITH US AT THE TABLE SO -- THE THE OTHER ISSUE WE HAVE WITH THIS PARTICULAR STRATEGY IS IT'S FULL OF EXEMPTIONS FOR AGRICULTURE AND AREAS. AND WE FEEL LIKE THE REEVALUATION COULD -- ENACT SOLUTIONS IN THE FIRST SIX TO TWELVE MONTHS WITH THE INTERMEDIATION. THAT WOULD NOT HAVE THESE RESTRICTIONS I THINK WE'LL HAVE BETTER SOLUTIONS COMING OUT OF THE P. R.. THANK YOU I'M. THESE ANTI COAGULANT ARE THESE -- CAN THIS ONLY BE -- BOUGHT COMMERCIALLY. CAN THE AVERAGE CALIFORNIAN GO BUY IT. AT THIS POINT AND THE ANSWER IS NO. NO THE NOW I KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAVE WORKED WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF PESTICIDE REGULATION ON IS -- IS ONLINE INTERNET SALES -- BECAUSE THEY RECOGNIZE THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS -- THAT'S AN UNREGULATED SECTION OF COMMERCE THAT THEY THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO GET THEIR HANDS ON OKAY SO. SO OVER THE COUNTER NO BUT YOU CAN STILL RELATIVELY EASILY GET A GENERALLY OPERATORS ARE THE ONLY ONES WHO HAVE ACCESS. TO THIS TYPE OF CORRECT SOLUTION CORRECT AND IF I CAN ADD TO THAT PLEASE FOR ME I HAVE -- ONE OF THE AGAIN TO SERVE TO SUPPORT WHAT JIM WAS SAYING THAT WE THAT WE DON'T DISAGREE AGAIN WITH THE PREMISE OF THE BILL WE JUST FEEL THAT. THAT -- THAT THE DEPARTMENT PESTERED REGULATION NO HAS A PROCESS SPECIFICALLY TO YOU KNOW TO ADDRESS AND COME FORTH WITH WITH AN APPROPRIATE SET OF MITIGATION THAT -- THAT WE THAT WE CAN -- ARE THAT WE CAN ALL. AGREE UPON. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM. A VICE CHAIR AND ANYONE ELSE. OKAY DO WE HAVE A MOTION. OKAY COULD I GET A MOTION GREAT. ALL RIGHT. THERE'S NOTHING MORE YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- WAITING IS REALLY NOT -- THE BEST OPTION HERE WE KNOW THAT THIS PROBLEM EXISTS IT IS EXISTED FOR SEVERAL YEARS IT'S GOTTEN WORSE -- HOW WE CAN ALWAYS ADJUST LATER ON AND AND MISTER CHAIR YOU KNOW YOU THAT -- ABOVE -- YOU AND THE ADVOCATES -- ON THIS BILL I HAVE THE OF MY THE AGREEMENT TO CONTINUE TO WORK GOING FORWARD ON THE ON THE LANGUAGE. AND PERHAPS WE CAN GET TO A PLACE WERE -- ALL AGREEABLE. IT WOULD BE GREAT ALL RIGHT. HIGHER TO THE THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND EIGHT FOUR YEARS IS TOO LONG TO WAIT -- THIS IS CLEARLY. AN ISSUE RIGHT NOW WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING RIGHT NOW I REGION I VOTE IF YOU VOTES -- WHY DON'T WE CALL THE PREVIOUS TWO ITEMS AGAIN AND GET THE ABSENT MEMBER ITEM ONE WHICH IS AB TWO SEVENTEEN AND ONE OF THE WORKERS SEE ON THE VOTE IS AT? FOUR TWO BAUER-KAHAN. DALY CRISTINA GARCIA CRISTINA GARCIA HI SELECT A COLOR. TWO FIVE TWO SHE PASSES OUT YEAH THAT BILL IS NOW OUT. WE DIDN'T SPEND THAT SEVENTY FIVE MINUTES IN VAIN. WE HAVE ITEM NUMBER TWO AS WELL HERE -- IT'S AB. ONE THIRTY FOUR BLOOM. ON THE VOTE IS AT FOUR ZERO BAUER-KAHAN. DALLY CRISTINA GARCIA. CRISTINA GARCIA AYE THAT TAKES A VOTE.

IS SHE ALRIGHT BELL IS MOVED IS THERE A SECOND [inaudible] DID WE SO YOU MOVED IT RIGHT. ALL RIGHT I'LL SECOND. WE HAVE PEOPLE ASSEMBLY DIGAS. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THIS FIND COMMITTEE TODAY I PRESENT TO YOU AB ELEVEN TWENTY THREE WHICH ENSURES THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND HIS OFFICE RECEIVED NOTICE. OF PROP SIXTY FIVE APPEALS. PROP SIXTY FIVE THE SAFE DRINKING WATER TOXIC ENFORCEMENT ACT OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX REQUIRES THAT THE BUSINESS THAT EXPOSES CONSUMERS TO CHEMICALS LISTED AS CARCINOGENS OR REPRODUCTIVE TOXICANTS MUST FIRST PROVIDE CLEAR AND REASONABLE WARNING. LEAVE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL FORCES PROP SIXTY FIVE TO REDUCE THE PUBLIC'S EXPOSURE TO TOXIC CHEMICALS IN FOOD NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENTS INFANT FORMULA FURNITURE AND A HOST OF OTHER CONSUMER GOODS AND PRODUCTS. IN ACCORDANCE WITH PROP SIXTY FIVE PRIVATE CITIZENS CAN ENFORCE THE STATUTE IN THE PRIDE IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST. CITIZENS MUST SEND A NOTICE TO AN ALLEGED VIOLATOR AND TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL ADVISING OF THE ALLEGED VIOLATION. PRIVATE. ENFORCERS MUST ALSO REPORT TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE WHEN THEY FILE A COMPLAINT OR SETTLEMENT. THESE REQUIREMENTS ALLOW THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO EVALUATE CLAIMS AND ENSURE THAT PRIVATE ENFORCERS CLAIMS HAVE MERIT. AND THAT PRIVATE LAWSUITS AND SETTLEMENTS ARE IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE PUBLIC. HOWEVER THERE ARE NO REQUIREMENTS THE PRIVATE ENFORCES YOUR DEFENSE SUPPORT ANY OTHER PROP SIXTY FIVE ACTIVITIES TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL INCLUDING ONE AN APPEAL IS FILED. AS A RESULT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE MAY BE UNAWARE OF PENDING APPEALS AND THE COURT OF APPEALS. OUR FREQUENTLY ASKED TO OPINE ON THE LAW WITHOUT THE BENEFIT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S INPUT RISKING A DECISION THAT WILL SET PRECEDENTS. AND DAMAGING TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S AUTHORITY TO ENFORCE THE LAW. HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL IS MARIO THE BUT NOT ONLY WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS MARIO DIBERNARDO HERE ON BEHALF OF ATTORNEY GENERAL. SERRA WHO'S PROUD TO SPONSOR THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION -- THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MENTIONED. BASICALLY MOST OF THE POINTS I WAS GOING TO REYES. ONE THING I WOULD LIKE TO ADD IS THAT NGUYEN IS SO IT'S A VERY SIMPLE BILL RIGHT IT'S IF A IF A LITIGANT IS APPEALING A PROP SIXTY FIVE CASE ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS SEND NOTICE TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE THAT THEY'RE DOING SO. NOTHING MORE NOTHING LESS PROPOSITION SIXTY FIVE ALREADY HAS LOTS OF PROVISIONS REGARDING NOTICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL DURING THE TRIAL PHASES OF THE THE CASES. THIS IS RELATED TO THE PALETTE CASE -- IF A CASE GOES SIDEWAYS EITHER WAY IN THE APPELLATE COURT AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WAS NOT AWARE OF THE CASE WE HAVE TO THAN PETITION -- FOR DEEP PUBLICATION TO AVOID A A HARMFUL PRESIDENTIAL DECISION AND THIS IS HAPPENED RECENTLY TWICE. AND WE WANT TO AVOID HAVING TO GO THROUGH THAT BY REQUIRING THIS NOTICE DURING THE APPELLATE STAGE. SO THAT WE HAVE THESE CASES ON OUR RADAR AND WE CAN INFORM THE CORE WHEN IT'S APPROPRIATE. THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHER AREAS OF THE LAW THAT PROVIDE SIMILAR REQUIREMENTS ON LITIGANTS INCLUDING IN THE CALIFORNIA DISABILITY LAWS THE UNFAIR COMPETITION LAWS SEEK WAS AND THE FALSE CLAIMS ACT.

A THOUSAND EMPLOYEES. AND INTO SOME PROPERTY THAT WE ON A PORTABLE PART OF THAT PROJECT IS A TERTIARY TREATMENT PLAN. FOR WITH FOR WATER SO THAT OUR PROJECT HAS NO IMPACT ON PORTABLES POSSIBLE WATER. BUT WITHOUT OPPORTUNITY IN PLACE THE FUNDING THAT WE MAY BE ABLE TO ACQUIRE. WITH THIS BILL CAN. EXPAND THAT. TO REALLY HELP THE CITY OF PORTABLE. WE TRY TO BE THE GOOD NEIGHBOR AS THE TRIBE YOU KNOW THE TRIBE HAS OVER THIRTY DEPARTMENTS OF ITS OWN ITS OWN POLICE ITS OWN FIRE ITS OWN SCHOOL -- BUT A LOT OF OUR CHILDREN GO TO SCHOOL IN PORTABLE -- ALL OF OUR HIGH SCHOOL KIDS GO TO THERE. AND WE HAVE A BIG ISSUE WITH WATER OUR CURRENT PLAN ON THE RESERVATION PRODUCES ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND GALLONS A DAY AND WE PROBABLY IS ABOUT THAT. AND SOMETIMES IN OUR LOW WATER PERIODS THE WATERS THE COLOR OF THIS. TABLE HERE IN FRONT OF ME -- THAT WE ARE FORCED TO DRINK TO TRY PROVIDES. OTHER SOURCES OF WATER FOR YOU KNOW THOSE THAT THAT NEEDED OF THAT RUN OUT. AND I THINK THAT MOVING FORWARD AND IF THIS IS SUCCESSFUL THAT WE CAN REALLY [inaudible] STOP.

OUR NEXT IS ASSEMBLY MEMBER CORREA'S VAL AND CONGRATULATIONS -- TO THE CHIEF AS WELL AS MR MATHIS YOU MAKE PROCEED WHEN READY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M HERE 2% ASSEMBLY BILL. FIFTEEN HUNDRED WHICH WOULD AND BOLD AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO TAKE IMMEDIATE ACTION AGAINST LOCAL THREATS TO OUR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY. IN CAIFORNIA MULTIPLE REGULATORY AUTHORITIES HAVE JURISDICTION OVER BUSINESSES THAT HANDLE OR GENERATE HAZARDOUS HAZARDOUS WASTE A MATERIAL THAT POSE A RISK TO PUBLIC SAFETY. AND HEALTH THIS INCLUDES FOR EXAMPLE THE SOUTH COAST AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT AND THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TOOK A TOXIC SUBSTANCE CONTROL. LOCALLY A CERTIFIED PROGRAM AGENCY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR IMPLEMENTING AND ENFORCING HAZARDOUS MATERIALS AND WASTE LAWS AND THE LOCAL HEALTH OFFICER HAS GENERAL THIRTY TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC'S HEALTH AND EXPAND ORTIZ BIG THIRTY IN CASES OF DECLARED. EMERGENCY. CURRENTLY SOME FACILITIES THAT EMIT HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCE CONTINUE TO OPERATE BECAUSE THEY DO NOT MEET. THE REGULATORY MINIMUM STANDARDS TO CEASE OPERATIONS IMMEDIATELY. A PRIME EXAMPLE OF THIS TYPE OF ATROCITY IMPACTING OUR COMMUNITIES. BEING THE EXIDE BATTERY RECYCLING FACILITY IN VERNON CALIFORNIA THE EXITE PLANT CONTINUOUSLY EXPOSED FAMILIES AND RESIDENTS OF MY DISTRICT. AS WELL AS THE DISTRICTS OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER SANTIAGO GARCIA CRISTINA GARCIA AND SPEAKER RENDON -- COMBINED WE REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY TWO MILLION PEOPLE. THE COMMUNITIES WERE EXPOSED TO DANGEROUS LEVELS OF TOXIC LEAD. UNTIL THE FACILITY WAS FINALLY SHUT DOWN IN. TWENTY FIFTEEN IT PAINS ME TO SHARE THAT PRIOR TO EXCITE. PRIOR TO THE X. I. PLAN BEING SHUT DOWN THE BATTERY RECYCLING FACILITY DEPOSITED HIGHLY DAMAGING LEVELS OF LEAD INTO OUR FAMILY'S HOMES. WALKWAYS AND YARDS FROM NINETEEN TWENTY TWO UNTIL TWENTY FOURTEEN THAT'S OVER NINETY YEARS. NEARLY THREE HUNDRED CHILDREN YOUNGER THAN SIX WHO WERE LIVING. NEAR EXCITED WERE FOUND TO HAVE HIGH BLOOD LEVELS IN. TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THE LAST YEAR THE X. I. PLANT WAS IN FULL OPERATION. THE DELAY TO SHUT THIS FACILITY DOWN LED TO EMISSIONS FROM THE PLANT CONTAMINATING MORE THAN. TEN THOUSAND RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES ACROSS THE NUMBER OF COMMUNITIES IN LA COUNTY. LAST YEAR. MYSELF AND THE MEMBERS MENTIONED -- PARTICIPATED AND CREATED AN OVERSIGHT HEARING THAT THE STATE LEGISLATURE HOSTED IN LOS ANGELES I SHED LIGHT. ON THIS CATASTROPHIC EVENT. WITH THE INPUT OF OUR COMMUNITY. WE DISCUSS EXCITES WRONGDOINGS THAT HAD IMPACTED THE LIVES OF THOUSANDS OF RESIDENTS IN OUR COMMUNITIES. SO MANY STILL LIVE WITH THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE TOXIC LEAD SEEPING INTO THEIR HOMES TILL THIS DAY. ASSEMBLY BILL FIFTEEN HUNDRED IT'S A DIRECT RESPONSE TO THE CONCERNS AND FRUSTRATIONS EXPRESSED IN OUR COMMUNITIES. TO THE MEMBERS OF THE STATE LEGISLATURE. THIS BILL IS IMPERATIVE TO ENSURE THAT LOCAL AUTHORITIES CLOSEST TO OUR COMMUNITIES IMPACTED BY TOXIC. POLLUTION. CAN EXPEDITIOUSLY PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH. AND PUBLIC SAFETY. AB FIFTEEN HUNDRED WILL ENABLE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO DIRECT THE FACILITY OR PORTION OF A FACILITY TO TEMPORARILY DISCONTINUE THE OPERATIONS THAT HAVE EXPOSED. OUR COMMUNITIES TO HARMFUL TOXIC MATERIALS UNTIL THAT ISSUE IS CORRECTED. WITH THE SUPPORT OF OUR SPONSORS WE HAVE CRAFTED A BILL THAT SPECIFIES THE BOARD CAN ONLY EXERCISE. IF THERE IS AN EMINENT THREAT OR EVENT THAT ENDANGERS. OUR RESIDENTS. WE NEED TO DISCOURAGE BUSINESSES FROM OPERATING WITHOUT PERMITS. BUT ALSO ENSURE THAT PUBLIC HEALTH IS OUR NUMBER ONE PRIORITY. IT'S NOT WAIT. FOR A REGULATORY AGENCY TO ALLOW US TO TAKE THE NECESSARY ACTION WHEN THE SAFETY. OF OUR COMMUNITY IS AT STAKE. THAT SAID OUR EXPERT SHOULD BE CONSULTED IN PROTECTING OUR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS WITH THIS IN MIND. I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS TODAY THAT WILL REQUIRE CONSULTATION BETWEEN THE HEALTH OFFICER IN THE PRIMARY PERMITTING AGENCIES. I WOULD LIKE TO SINCERELY THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF. FOR WORKING WITH OUR OFFICE AND STRAINING THE TECHNICAL FRAMEWORK OF THIS VERY IMPORTANT BILL. I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING MY WORK WITH THE KNOWLEDGE WITH KNOWLEDGEABLE STAKEHOLDERS. TO CLARIFY IMMINENT THREAT. AN EMINENT ENDANGERMENT. THAT ARE REFERRED TO IN OUR ASSEMBLY BILL. TO ENSURE THE SCOPE OF THIS LEGISLATION IS NARROWLY TAILORED TO MEET OUR GOALS OF WORKING WITH THE INDUSTRY TO PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES. TODAY WE HAVE DOCTOR DOCTOR CYRUS RANKIN DIRECTOR OF THE BUREAU TOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT -- LA COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT RANDY SAWYER THE CHIEF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH AND HAZARDOUS MATERIAL OFFICER CONTRA COSTA COUNTY. AND I JUST DIDN'T MILAN WHO WILL OFFER MORE -- TESTIMONY. THANK YOU. A PLEASE. BOB FOUR MINUTES TOTAL. MY NAME IS DOCTOR SIRES RANKING I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE BUREAU OF TOXICOLOGY ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND DEPUTY HEALTH OFFICER THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT. AB FIFTEEN HUNDRED IS ABOUT STRENGTHENING THE ABILITY OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO TAKE IMMEDIATE ACTION AGAINST LOCAL THREATS THE PUBLIC'S HEALTH AND SAFETY WHICH IS CURRENTLY LACKING. TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC'S HEALTH AND SAFETY LOCAL HEALTH OFFICERS HAVE LONGSTANDING AUTHORITY TO IMMEDIATELY ORDER TEMPORARY CLOSURE OF A CONTAMINATED BEACH OR WATER SUPPLY WITH THE CLOSURE OF A RESTAURANT FOR INSANITARY CONDITIONS OR TAKE ACTION NECESSARY IN RESPONSE TO FOOD BORNE ILLNESS OR OTHER COMMUNICABLE DISEASE. WILL HELP OFFICER AUTHORITY OVER THESE ENTITIES IS TIED TO AN ESTABLISHED UNDERSTANDING THAT PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS MUST PREVENT THE SPREAD OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES OR BIOLOGICAL THREATS WHENEVER POSSIBLE. HOWEVER WHEN THERE'S A CHEMICAL THREAT TO THE THREAT OF THE PUBLIC'S HEALTH AND SAFETY LOCAL HEALTH OFFICERS LACK STATUTORY AUTHORITY TO TAKE IMMEDIATE ACTION AGAINST THE RESPONSIBLE PARTIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CLEAR EMERGENCY. AB FIFTEEN HUNDRED SEEKS TO ALIGN HEALTH OFFICER AUTHORITY OVER CHEMICAL THREATS WITH ITS ESTABLISHED AUTHORITY TO STOP BIOLOGICAL THREATS. LA COUNTY HAS FACE NUMEROUS CRISES IN IN WHICH RESPONSIBLE PARTIES RELEASE CHEMICALS INTO THE ENVIRONMENT PRESENTING A SUBSTANTIAL ENDANGERMENT TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES THE ABSENCE OF A CLEAR EMERGENCY. FOR EXAMPLE IN AUGUST TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE SOUTH COAST AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT'S AIR MONITORING STATIONS REGISTERED ELEVATED LEVELS OF CHROMIUM SIX A KNOWN HUMAN CARCINOGEN. IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY NOW THE AGENCY DETERMINED THAT THE ELEVATED LEVELS WERE HIGH ENOUGH TO CAUSE LONG TERM HEALTH RISKS BUT SINCE IT DID NOT POSE AN IMMEDIATE RISK TO LIFE AND HEALTH. IT WAS NOT DECLARED AN EMERGENCY AND DUSTED NOT DIRECTED BUSINESSES TO CEASE THEIR OPERATIONS. NOW BECAUSE CHROMIUM SIX IS ONE OF A HANDFUL OF CHEMICALS THAT IS SCIENTIFICALLY PROVEN TO CAUSE HUMAN CANCER. AT THAT TIME OUR LOCAL HEALTH OFFICER ISSUED SEVERAL PUBLIC HEALTH DIRECTIVES TO MIDDLE WORKING FACILITIES IN THE AREA THAT WE'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR ELEVATED LEVELS. OF IF YOU COULD YOU'VE USED TO MINUTES COULD YOU JUST SUMMARIZE VERY QUICKLY ALL WRAPPED UP YES. SO THIS BILL ESSENTIALLY WOULD ALLOW LOCAL AUTHORITIES INCLUDING THE CERTIFIED UNIFIED PLANNING AGENCIES. THE PROGRAM AGENCIES AND LOCAL HEALTH OFFICERS TO TAKE IMMEDIATE ACTION DIRECTOR OF FACILITIES THAT POSE AN IMMINENT AND SUBSTANTIAL ENDANGERMENT TO PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY AND TO TEMPORARILY CEASE OPERATIONS OTHER FACILITY OR PORTIONS OF THEIR FACILITIES UNTIL THE ISSUE IS CORRECT. THANK YOU. OKAY YOU HAVE A MAN AND A HALF LEFT THE CHURCH JUST MULLIN FOR THE LOCAL IN BRAMBLE HEALTH DIRECTORS BECAUSE SPONSORING A BILL WITH LA COUNTY AND I YIELD MY TIME TO THE EXPECT NEXT TO ME. THANK YOU GREAT MY NAME IS RANDY SO HERE AS MENTIONED EARLIER AND CHIEF ENVIRONMENTAL. HEALTH AND HAS JUST MATERIALS OFFICER FOR CONTRA COSTA CANYON -- AS DOCTOR AGAIN BUT SHARED AB FIFTEEN HUNDRED WE'RE NOT GOING STRENGTHENED LOCAL HEALTH OFFICERS ABILITY TO MEET TAKE IMMEDIATE ACTION AGAINST THREAT. BUT IT ALSO STRENGTHENED ABILITY OF THE CERTIFIED YOU KNOW BY FIVE PROGRAMS KNOWN AS COOPER'S. TO DIRECT THIS SILLY SAILING OR GENERATING HAS AS WE MATURE AS A CEASE OPERATIONS THAT FACILITY POSES FINANCIAL OR MAKE IMMEDIATE. THREAT TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY. COOPER'S REGULATE THOUSANDS OF BUSINESS AT HAND OR GENERATE THE HUNT -- HAZARDOUS MATERIALS THESE BUSINESS RANGE IN SIZE FROM A SMALL BUSINESS SUCH AS A MACHINE SHOP. AUTO REPAIR AND DRY CLEANERS TO LARGER BUSINESSES INVOLVED WITH METAL PLATING AND PROCESS AND CHEMICAL FORMULATION -- THOMAS GET DOWN HERE WE HAD A IN CONTRA COSTA COUNTY THERE WAS AN INCIDENT. WHERE -- WE OFFICIALLY REGENERATED SUPPER GAS IT HAD A RELEASE FROM RAIL CAR CONTAINING OLD HIM. AS A RESULT SUFFER TRACKSIDE REACTED WITH WATER IN THE AIR THE PRODUCES OPERATE CAST A CLOUD. OVER TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE SOUGHT MEDICAL ATTENTION FROM THIS RELEASE AFTER THE RELEASE OCCURRED THERE WERE A SERIES OF OTHER SMALLER RELEASES FROM THE SAME FACILITY THEY IMPACTED COMMUNITY. HI RES EXAMPLE BECAUSE DURING THESE ADVANCE WE LACK THE ABILITY TO ACQUIRE THE SILLY TO STOP OPERATIONS AND IS AND TO US. CITY VALUATION COULD BE FORMER BE PERFORMED. SO AB FIFTEEN HUNTER WILL GRANT US THAT THEY'RE READY TO DIRECT SUCH A FACILITY FROM OPERATING THEIR FACILITY. OR PORTIONS OF THEIR FACILITY TO CEASE OPERATIONS INTO SAFETY EVALUATION FORM. ADDITIONALLY AB FIFTEEN HUNDRED HAS COMMONSENSE PROVISIONS IMPOSE FINES AND BUSINESSES THEY ARE SUBJECT TO COOPER LAWS BUT OPERATE WITHOUT PERMITS. THEIR BUSINESS IS THE HANDOVER GENERATE HAZARDOUS MATERIALS TO REMAIN ON REGULATED. THEY NOT ONLY OPERATE OUTSIDE OF THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK BUT THE ALSO MEETING AN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE OVER BUSINESSES THAT ARE COMPLIANT. TO STATE LAWS AND REGULATIONS. MAYBE FIFTEEN HUNDRED ENSURE LOCAL AUTHORITIES HAVE -- THAT THEIR THIRTY DAY ACT IN THE INTERESTS OF BURKE CONSTANTS AND SUCH FACILITIES THREATEN HEALTH AND SAFETY OF OUR COMMUNITIES. THEREFORE I URGE YOU TO PASS A BE. FIFTEEN HUNDRED THANK YOU ARE GAVE AN EXTRA MINUTE. ALL RIGHT -- LET'S SEE OTHERS IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY CALMLY WITH THE LA COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS FOR THE ONE OF THE PROUD SPONSORS OF THIS BILL AND I THINK THE COMMITTEE AND THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING A SPORT THANK YOU. MICHELLE GIVEN THAT THE COUNTY HEALTH EXECUTIVES ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WE REPRESENT LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND PLEASED TO BE HEARD SUPPORT. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS MARIO TRAY SERWIS I'M CURRENTLY THE ACTING DIVISION CHIEF OF THE HEALTH HAZARDS MATERIALS DIVISION A LOS ANGELES COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ALL RIGHT -- SO I'M GLAD WE HAD A THOROUGH DISCUSSION. UP CAN WE HEAR FROM THE OPPOSITION. NO OPPOSITION OKAY GOOD A MISTER MURATSUCHI THANK YOU -- THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BRING IT IS IMPORTANT BILL FOR IT I SEE A NUMBER MY CITIES THAT ALREADY SIGNED ON IN SUPPORT OF OF YOUR BILL -- I I JUST WANT -- TO MMHM -- WELL FIRST ASK -- SO THIS THIS -- AUTHORITY DOESN'T ALREADY EXIST IN AND CURRENT LAW. I CAN HELP ANSWER THAT -- SO. WHEN IT COMES TO A CHEMICAL FACILITY RELEASING LEVELS OF A CHEMICAL THAT ARE IMMEDIATELY DANGEROUS TO LIFE AND HEALTH THEN CERTAINLY OUR FIRE DEPARTMENT CAN STEP IN ORDER EVACUATIONS ETCETERA TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH? HOWEVER WHEN IT COMES TO SOMETHING LIKE THIS WHEN LEVELS OF A CERTAIN CHEMICAL ARE BEING RELEASED INTO COMMUNITY OVER THE COURSE OF SEVERAL WEEKS TO MONTHS TO YEARS -- CAUSING CHRONIC LONG TERM HEALTH RISKS THIS IS WHERE THERE'S A GAP BETWEEN WITH THE FIRE DEPARTMENTS CAN DO IN THE COOPER S. CAN DO AND WHAT HEALTH OFFICERS CAN DO SO THIS WOULD GRANT THE AUTHORITY TO LOCAL HEALTH. HELP OFFICER TO SEIZE THOSE OPERATIONS THAT THE OTHER AGENCIES CANNOT TIRADES. I JUST -- SEE ELABORATE THAT FOUR LONG STANDING LOW IS THAT THE PUT THE HEALTH OFFICER HAS A POLICE POWER. BUT THEY HAVE TO EVOKE EIGHT LOCALS STATE OF EMERGENCY SO THIS WHAT HE SAID THIS WOULD CIRCUMVENT THAT PRICES IN IN A PLACES LARGEST LA YOU DON'T. HAD THE WHOLE COUNTY BEING IN A STATE OF EMERGENCY BECAUSE A ONE FACILITY A ONE LOCATION SO THIS THIS STILL KEEPS THE STANDARD OF IMMINENT PUBLIC HEALTH IT DOESN'T REQUIRE THAT -- DETERMINATION OF THE STATE OF EMERGENCY OKAY SO. AS AS SAYS SOME MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE NO I I HAVE AN ISSUE IN IN IN MY DISTRICT OF THE TORTURE FINERY. WHERE THEY USE A HIGHLY TOXIC CHEMICAL HYDROCHLORIC ACID? I AND MANY PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY ARE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT. YOU KNOW AT IF THAT CHEMICAL WERE -- TO TO TO BE RELEASED ACCIDENTALLY RELEASED -- IT WOULD. TO POTENTIALLY BECAUSE DEATH AND AND AND SERIOUS HARM TO TO THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE LIVING WITHIN THE PERCENT OF THE REFINERY BUT ACCORDING TO THE LA COUNTY THE TESTIMONY YOU'RE YOU'RE SAYING THAT. IF FOR FOR THAT KIND OF IMMEDIATE. LIFE THREATENING -- THAT THAT AUTHORITY I READ EXISTS BUT THIS WOULD BE -- ALSO EXTEND THAT AUTHORITY ALSO TO TO THE EXACT TYPE SITUATIONS WHERE THERE WOULD BE. PERHAPS NOT IMMEDIATE HARM BUT BUT HARM OVER A PERIOD OF TIME THAT'S CORRECT. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ALL RIGHT -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA. THANK YOU AND I THINK JUST TO PAY YOU BACK A LITTLE BIT ON ON YOUR QUESTION -- WE PASSED THE A. B.. ELEVEN THIRTY TWO COUPLE YEARS AGO THEY GAVE AIR DISTRICTS A SIMILAR IT ALREADY AND IT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE THAT WE'RE EXPANDING SOMETHING LIKE THAT FOR OUR HEALTH AGENCIES AND WE SAW IT WITH EXCEPT THAT THEY WERE VERY DIFFERENT AGENCIES THAT COULD TAKE ACTION ENDED IN BUT WE SAW. THE WHOLE THEIR WITH CONNIE AND SIX A AND SOME OF THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY SO WHEN I THINK YOU FOR THE EXPANSION OF THAT APPLICATION TO ANOTHER AGENCY -- MAKES A LOT OF SENSE. VERY GOOD OTHER QUESTIONS. THERE BEING NO OTHER QUESTIONS -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER CARILLO YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AB FIFTEEN HUNDRED IS COMMONSENSE LEGISLATION. THAT WILL ENABLE OUR LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO ACT IN THE INTEREST OF OUR CONSTITUENTS AND BETTER PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES HEALTH. AND SAFETY THIS BILL ENJOYS BROAD SUPPORT FROM LOCAL HEALTH EXECUTIVES LOCAL AGENCIES AND ENVIRONMENTAL ADVOCATES AND I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. ALL RIGHT WE NEED A MOTION AND A SECOND. MOVED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA SECONDED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER MURATSUCHI. NOTHING MORE NEEDED WHAT IS THE MOTION MANAGE TO PASS.

THANK -- GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS IN HERE 2% AB. SEVEN FIVE SIX WHICH YOU REQUIRE PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS IN CALIFORNIA TOMORROW MONITOR FOR FLORA CALL LIKE AND THE FOR THE FOR ALL LOOK COLE WAS UP THE SAYS THE CLASS OF CHEMICALS KNOWN AS P. FIVE IT ALSO REQUIRES THE PUBLIC WATER SYSTEM TO PUBLISH. AND KEEP CURRENT ON THE INTERNET WATER QUALITY INFORMATION RELATING TO REGULATED CONTAMINANTS IN THE WATER SYSTEMS. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE I WILL. FEED MY TEND TO THE EXPERTS TODAY. ALL RIGHT. EXPERTS YOU HAVE FOUR MINUTES TOTAL MY NAME IS SUSAN LITTLE AND WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING GROUP BUT I'M HERE. TO EXPRESS THEIR ARMOR EWG IS SUPPORT AND CONCEPT FOR THIS BILL AS WELL AS CLEAN WATER ACTIONS AND JUST LET YOU KNOW THAT WE ARE. WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR -- TO FURTHER PROMOTE FURTHER PURSUE THIS PERSON PROPOSAL AND I'M STOPPING THERE AND SEATING IF POSSIBLE MY IT'S TIME. TO ANNA RATE -- GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU -- MY NAME IS ANNA READ I'M A SCIENTIST WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL. SCIENTISTS AND HEALTH OFFICIALS AROUND THE WORLD -- HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT THIS CRYING CLASS OF SYNTHETIC CHEMICALS FOR SEVERAL REASONS THEY'RE VERY PERSISTENT WHICH MEANS THEY DON'T BREAK DOWN THE HIGHLY MOBILE WHICH MEANS THAT THEY SPREAD THROUGHOUT OUR ENVIRONMENT VERY QUICKLY. AND THE ONES THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN STUDIES HAVE SHOWN A WIDE VARIETY OF HEALTH -- ADVERSE HEALTH EFFECTS INCLUDING CANCER HARM TO DEVELOPING FETUSES INFANTS AND CHILDREN -- AND HARM TO THE IMMUNE SYSTEM -- ALTHOUGH WE DON'T HAVE HEALTH INFORMATION ALL FORTY FIVE THOUSAND CHEMICALS WITHIN THIS CLASS WE DO KNOW IS THAT -- MORE COMPLEX CHEMICALS WITHIN THIS CLASS BREAK DOWN INTO -- OR OR INTO A SMALL SUBGROUP OF THESE CHEMICALS THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF INFORMATION ON AND IN TERMS OF THEIR TOXICITY -- AND THAT'S WHY THE ACTING DIRECTOR OF DTS THE EXPLAINED IN A STATE HEARING SEVERAL WEEKS AGO THAT ALL ROADS LEAD TO P. FAA'S WHICH IS THE SMALL SUBGROUP. OF P. FAST THAT WE NOW ARE ASSOCIATED WITH -- ADVERSE HEALTH EFFECTS -- AND WHY THE SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM IN CALIFORNIA IS LOOKING AT THE ENTIRE CLASS OF THESE CHEMICALS IN CARPET -- UNDERSTANDING THE EXTENT OF PEANUTS CONTAMINATION IN CALIFORNIA DRINKING WATER. IS AN AND ENTERING THE IMPORTANT STEP IN OUR PROTECT IN CALIFORNIANS FROM EXPOSURE TO THESE TOXIC CHEMICALS. ARE BASED ON NATIONAL MONITORING FOUR YEARS AGO -- THEIR APPROXIMATE THREE POINT FIVE MILLION CALIFORNIANS ABOUT 10% OF OUR POPULATION THAT ARE DRINKING P. FAST CONTAMINATED WATER. HOWEVER THIS IS ACTUALLY -- LIKELY A UNDERESTIMATE -- OF THE THE EXTENT OF CONTAMINATION OF OUR DRINKING WATER THIS IS BECAUSE NATIONAL TESTING -- HAS SEVERAL LIMITATIONS THEIR REPORTING LIMITS WERE VERY HIGH HIGHER THAN LEVELS THAT ARE OF HEALTH CONCERN. ARE THERE WERE ONLY A FEW P. FAST TESTED. FOR TOM AND IT FOCUSED ON LARGER SYSTEMS OVER TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE START. WHICH MEANS THAT THERE COULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE I CALIFORNIANS DRINKING PEOPLE'S CONTAMINATED WATER THAN WE KNOW NOW. FOR REFERENCE -- WHEN MICHIGAN EXPANDED -- IT'S TESTING FOR BEFORE US IN ITS OWN WATER. THEY FOUND ESTIMATES FOR AFFECTED POPULATION WENT FROM UNDER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE TO OVER ONE POINT FIVE MILLION PEOPLE. THERE'S A HANDOUT THAT -- WAS SENT OUT -- IF THERE'S TIME I CAN GO THROUGH A QUICK OR CAN SKIP YOU HAVE ANOTHER. MINUTE AND FIFTEEN SECONDS. BASICALLY IT SHOWS IN THE AND THE THE FIRST MAP SHOWS THE RESULTS FROM THE NATIONAL TESTING. THE SECOND MAP SHOWS FROM WHEN CAP A MICHIGAN DID THEIR OWN TESTING WHERE THEY TESTED ALL OF THE PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS. AND THEY ALSO DID SITE INVESTIGATIONS BASED OFF OF SITES WHERE -- THEY THOUGHT THEY WOULD BE RISK OF CONTAMINATION THEY FOUND OVER -- FIVE FORTY CONTAMINATION SITES NUMBER HUNDRED THEIR PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS WERE AFFECTED -- THIS COMPARISON REALLY HIGHLIGHTS HOW IMPORTANT COMPREHENSIVE TESTING IS FOR UNDERSTANDING -- THE CONTAMINATION EXISTS IN OUR WATER -- THAT WE AND OUR FAMILIES DRINK EVERY DAY -- AND TO WRAP UP AS THE THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD WE SUPPORT THE CONCEPT OF EXPANDED MONITORING AND WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT THE FOCUSES ON THE ENTIRE CLASS NOT JUST ONE CHEMICAL AT THE TIME -- THAT THERE IS A ANNUAL TESTING OF ALL CALIFORNIA PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS AT TO COMPLEMENT THE SITE INVESTIGATIONS THAT ARE GOING ON WITH THAT BY THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD. AND THAT THE MOST CURRENT TESTING METHODS ARE USED. TO CAPTURE THE GREATEST NUMBER OF PEOPLE US -- AT HEALTH RELEVANT LEVELS ON THANK YOU AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR AND WITH THE COMMITTEE AS THIS BILL MOVES TOWARD. ALL RIGHT -- OTHERS IN SUPPORT. NGUYEN COMMISSAIRE CLUB CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT. ANY IN OPPOSITION. ALL RIGHT WELL -- THE NEXT ITEM. WILL BE QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS BEAR. I WAS GONNA MAKE SIMPLY MEMBER BAUER CA HAGEN LEON -- YOU MADE A MOTION AS THEIR SECOND ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND -- QUESTIONS. SO WERE WERE RAT DEALING WITH THE P. FAST [inaudible] SO. OUR FIRST OF ALL THEIR NUMBER OF SORT OF DRAFTING SORTS OF ISSUES THAT WE HAVE HERE IN THE LIST AND I KNOW YOU WORK WITH US AND THOSE -- AND THIS IS A QUESTION FOR THE TECHNICAL EXPERT. SO WHAT THE WATER BOARD DO IS DOING RIGHT NOW IT'S TESTING FOR TO CHEMICALS. THERE IS A METHOD. TO TEST FOR SIXTEEN OTHERS. IT IS NOT CLEAR TO ME WHY WHEN THERE WAS ACTUALLY WITH THE TIME IT WAS DONE IT WAS ONLY TWELVE OTHERS BUT THERE'S COMING UP A NEW. A NEW TEST WHICH SHOULD LAST SIXTY NOW THERE'S BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHEN THAT'LL BE CERTIFIED SO THE POINT IS THERE ARE THERE'S NOW [inaudible] ON YOU THINK WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT THE CLASS IS A WHOLE WHEN WE DON'T HAVE A METHOD OF DOING THAT. SO WHAT WE MEAN BY LOOKING AT THE CLASS AS A WHOLE IS TO TAKE A CLASS BASED APPROACH SO TO THINK ABOUT THE CLASS AS A WHOLE. CLASS CONCERN OBVIOUSLY WORKING WITH IN THE TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY IS THAT WE HAVE NOW SO -- ACTUALLY THE WATER BOARD IN ITS SITE INVESTIGATION SO IT'S DURING A PHASE FRIGHTENED OF MASTICATION ONE THAT MEANS IS THAT THEY'RE GONNA LOOK AT SITES WHERE WE THINK WE KNOW THERE'S KIND CONTAMINATION. BASED OFF OF PREVIOUS USE SO FOR INSTANCE NEAR. DOT SITES -- AND WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE DOING IS ACTUALLY TESTING. FOR THAT THE WHAT WITH THE EPA METHOD WHICH WOULD BE FOURTEEN P. FASTER NOT JUST LOOKING AT THE FILE MP FAST -- FOR PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS THEY HAVE NOTIFICATION LEVELS ARE IN TERM NOTIFICATION LEVELS FOR JUST THOSE TWO AND THAT'S BECAUSE THEY WERE ASKED -- TO THAT THAT'S THE FIRST STEP THAT THEY COULD TAKE RATES OF THE WATER BOARD ASK THEM WHAT WOULD BE ARE. ASKED WE HOW WHAT WOULD BE IN TERM LEVELS FOR THESE TWO BASED OFF OF WHAT THE OTHER INFORMATION OUT THERE AND THEY BASED IT OFF NEW JERSEY'S. RISK ASSESSMENTS THAT THAT THEY'VE ALREADY DONE -- WE HAS NOW DOING ITS OWN ASSESSMENT OF THOSE TWO CHEMICALS BUT THE WATER BOARD -- CAN ASK THEM TO DO THAT AT SET IN TERM LEVELS -- A NOTIFICATION NOVELS FOR THE OTHERS AS WELL SO BUT THE QUESTION IS -- WHAT IS THE ADVANTAGE OF REQUIRING THE -- WATER UTILITIES TO TO ALSO TEST FOR THE OTHER CHEMICALS CAN BE DETECTED RAINY OTHER. TWELVE THE SITE INVESTIGATIONS -- WILL LOOK AT WHAT WE THINK WILL BE USED AREAS OF CONTAMINATION BUT FROM LOOKING OUR MICHIGAN DID -- BECAUSE THEY'VE DONE THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE TESTING IN THE NATION -- WHAT THEY FOUND WAS THERE THE TWO DON'T ALWAYS MATCH UP SO BASED OFF OF HISTORICAL INFORMATION THEY WENT INSIDE INVESTIGATION FROM THE FOUND OVER FORTY PLUS CONTAMINATION SITES WITHIN STATE? WHEREVER THERE ARE SOME -- AND THEN BUT THEY ALSO SURVEYS ALL OF THE PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS AND WHAT YOU SEE IS THERE ARE SOME PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS THAT DON'T HAVE CONTAMINATION -- BUT THERE ARE SITES WITHIN THAT AREA THAT ARE CONTAMINATED NOTS PROBABLY BECAUSE THAT PUBLIC WATER SYSTEM HAS A SOURCE THAT ISN'T NECESSARILY AFFECTED BY A YET BUT THAT AREAS SERVED BY -- WELL WATER. AND THEN VICE VERSA -- THERE ARE WORDS PUBLIC WATER CONTAMINATION UP PUBLIC WATER SYSTEM CONTAMINATION THAT WASN'T PROTECTED BY AT A SITE SO FOR INSTANCE IF YOU LOOK AT THE MAP YEAH BUT THE QUESTION IS. I THAT'S ALL FINE BUT YOU'RE NOT ANSWERING THE QUESTION OF WHY. WE WOULD ASK THE PUBLIC WATER COMPANIES. TO TEST. FOR FOURTEEN RATHER THAN TO AND REPORT ON TO RATHER THAN FOURTEEN RIGHT WHAT IS THE ADVANTAGE OF GOING IT WILL THIS SHOW SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAT IS REALLY THE QUESTION. RIGHT SO WHAT WE SEE AS BAD AND PEOPLE'S BLOOD THERE ARE THAT WE'VE SEEN -- AT LEAST FOUR DIFFERENT BE FAST THAT ARE COMMON THROUGHOUT -- PEOPLE'S BLOOD IN IN NATIONALLY SO THAT MEANS WERE BEING EXPLORED EXPOSED TO MORE THAN JUST THOSE -- TWO ALSO WHAT WE SEE IS THAT A LOT OF THESE CHEMICALS AYE OCCUR -- TOGETHER AND WATER THEY DON'T IT'S NOT THAT IT'S RARE THAT THERE'S ONLY P. PHí FOSS AND WATER. AND ALSO -- THE CDC HAS -- COME UP WITH NUMBERS FOR MORE THAN JUST BE PHONE BEFORE US IN TERMS OF HOW OKAY SO I STILL HAVEN'T HEARD FOR A REASON AND I WHY WE NEED TO TEST. AND GET REPORTS ON THE OTHER DOESN'T I I STILL HAVEN'T HEARD THAT FROM YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE SAYING THAT. THE THING IS HER. IN ARE THE SAME. THE SAME THINGS OCCUR. THAT P. FOSS BE FAST. THESE OTHER CHEMICALS ARE LIKELY TO BE THERE TOO SO WHY DO WE NEED TO TEST THE OTHER. FOURTEEN THAT'S THAT'S THE QUESTION I'M TRYING TO GET AN ANSWER TO BECAUSE THE RATIOS ARE ALWAYS THE SAME SO THE LEVELS OF CONTAMINATION BETWEEN SO THERE ARE SITES WHERE THERE WILL BE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE SHORT CHAINS THEN LONG CHAINS THAT WILL CHANGE THE TYPE OF TREATMENT THAT NEEDS. TO BE USED. ALSO IT GIVES US A BETTER IDEA OF THE TYPE OF CONTAMINATION THAT WE'RE WORKING WITH AND WHAT CHEMICALS WOULD NECESSARILY BE MORE IMPORTANT TO ADDRESS BASED OFF OF THE EXPOSURES THAT WAY OKAY AND YOU WOULD GET THIS BY LOOKING AT THESE OTHER TWELVE CHEMICALS. OKAY. THANK YOU. MR MATHIS THANK YOU ITS DISSOLUTION THE DISCUSSION WHEN IT MAKES SENSE TO TEST THE TO WIN AND IF IT DOES COME UP THEN DO FURTHER TESTING. VERSUS SPENDING THE MONEY. IN ENFORCING THE LOCALS A SPEND THE MONEY TO TO TEST. SEVERAL WHEN WE KNOW OKAY IF WE JUST USED TO IS AS YOU SAID IN YOUR STATEMENT. THAT OFTEN THE OTHERS ARE THERE STILL. LIKE I SAID BEFORE -- THERE ARE. ALL CONTAMINATION SITUATIONS ARE NOT THE SAME SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT INTO THE DETAILED DATA ON IN MICHIGAN THERE ARE SOME SITES WHERE THEY HAVE A LOT OF OTHER TYPES OF THE FAUCET NOT P. FILL MP FOSTER'S. TO AND THEN THERE'S OTHER SITES WORK FOR DOMINATED BY PEOPLE ON% THE FAUCET NOT THE OTHERS AND THE REASON WHY IT'S IMPORTANT IS BECAUSE THE TREATMENT IS DIFFERENT. FOR THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF P. FIVE NINE WE'VE DONE WE ALL UNDERSTAND THE THE TREATMENTS ARE DIFFERENT IT'S GONNA HAVE CONTAMINATION AND WE'RE TESTING FOR TWO TYPES. THAT WE KNOW OKAY NOW IT'S CONTAMINATED WE HAVE TESTS TO SEE WHAT ELSE IS IN THERE. IN A ONE TRIGGERS THE OTHER. BUT YOU YOU'RE SAYING TO GO AHEAD AND JUST. THERE WOULD LIKELY THERE WOULD BE SITES WHERE YOU CAN YOU CAN YOU BETTER SPEAK INTO THE MICROPHONE BECAUSE WE'RE RECORDING THIS AND I KNOW. YOU WANT TO TALK TO THE PERSON IS AND I HAVE A QUESTION. HE CAN HEAR YOU AND THE AUDIENCE AND THE PEOPLE WHO IN THE AUDIENCE AND THE GROUP THAT'S LISTENING TO THE BROADCAST CANCER JUST TALK INTO THE MICROPHONE. RIGHT SO THERE ARE WITH THEIR WILL THERE ARE SITUATIONS WHERE WE'VE SEEN THAT THERE ARE OTHER TYPES OF P.. COSTS WITHIN THE FOURTEEN ARMED THAT HAVE SHOWN UP BUT NOT WOULD NOT BEEN PROTECTED BY -- HE FELL AND THE FAST THE TO OKAY ALL RIGHT.
