SO MY PROBLEM WITH THIS IN ANY

00:54:18.489 --> 00:54:21.225 region:rollup2
OTHER BILL THAT RELIES ON

00:54:19.690 --> 00:54:22.392 region:rollup2
DEDUCTIONS.

00:54:21.225 --> 00:54:24.328 region:rollup2
IS THAT PEOPLE MAKE VERY LITTLE

00:54:22.392 --> 00:54:26.563 region:rollup2
MONEY.

00:54:24.328 --> 00:54:27.698 region:rollup2
WILL GET NO BENEFIT.

00:54:26.563 --> 00:54:29.233 region:rollup2
BUT IF YOU FOR EXAMPLE HAVE A

00:54:27.698 --> 00:54:30.467 region:rollup2

00:54:29.233 --> 00:54:32.236 region:rollup2
THOUSAND A YEAR.

00:54:30.467 --> 00:54:33.036 region:rollup2
YOU GET A LARGE BENEFIT.

00:54:32.236 --> 00:54:34.738 region:rollup2

IN THE OTHER HOUSE --

01:01:42.699 --> 01:01:47.737 region:rollup2

01:01:44.234 --> 01:01:48.972 region:rollup2
EXCEPTION THAT MAKES SOME SENSE.

01:01:47.737 --> 01:01:51.341 region:rollup2

BY.

01:01:51.808 --> 01:01:55.946 region:rollup2

01:01:57.247 --> 01:02:00.717 region:rollup2
THAT SOMEBODY ARM.

01:01:59.049 --> 01:02:02.385 region:rollup2
THE CONTRACTOR COULD BUY A LOT

01:02:00.717 --> 01:02:03.653 region:rollup2

01:02:02.385 --> 01:02:05.689 region:rollup2
IT'S BEING USED ON MULTIPLE

01:02:03.653 --> 01:02:06.957 region:rollup2
SITES.

01:02:05.689 --> 01:02:08.391 region:rollup2
BUT BECAUSE THEY'RE BUYING THEM

01:02:06.957 --> 01:02:10.460 region:rollup2
AT THE TIME THEY HAVE THIS

01:02:08.391 --> 01:02:12.028 region:rollup2
CONTRACT THAT THEY MIGHT --

01:02:10.460 --> 01:02:14.598 region:rollup2
JUST DECIDE TO BUY WHAT THEY

01:02:12.028 --> 01:02:14.898 region:rollup2

01:02:14.598 --> 01:02:16.866 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

01:02:14.898 --> 01:02:17.500 region:rollup2
SO -- THAT

01:02:16.866 --> 01:02:19.803 region:rollup2
WAS A CONCERN I HAVE IN THE BILL

01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:20.870 region:rollup2
--

01:02:19.803 --> 01:02:23.473 region:rollup2
IF YOU'RE EXCLUDING THEM FROM

01:02:20.870 --> 01:02:23.974 region:rollup2
ALL SALES TAXES OPPOSED TO JUST

01:02:23.473 --> 01:02:25.041 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT GO INTO THE

01:02:23.974 --> 01:02:27.043 region:rollup2
BUILDING.

01:02:25.041 --> 01:02:30.080 region:rollup2

OR NOT MACHINERY THAT WAS

01:02:33.483 --> 01:02:38.455 region:rollup2
PURCHASED AT THAT TIME AND MIGHT

01:02:35.218 --> 01:02:41.324 region:rollup2
BE USED IN OTHER --

01:02:38.455 --> 01:02:43.226 region:rollup2

01:02:43.226 --> 01:02:44.794 region:rollup2
YEAH.

01:02:43.793 --> 01:02:46.296 region:rollup2
IF ARGUMENT TO THE CHAIR INSISTS

01:02:44.794 --> 01:02:47.864 region:rollup2
QUESTION BASICALLY THE MEASURE

01:02:46.296 --> 01:02:49.065 region:rollup2
SAYS THAT THE EXEMPTION IS

01:02:47.864 --> 01:02:50.967 region:rollup2
LIMITED TO UNITED STATES

01:02:49.065 --> 01:02:52.435 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE PURCHASES.

01:02:50.967 --> 01:02:53.603 region:rollup2
AND VETERAN AFFAIRS THAT ARE

01:02:52.435 --> 01:02:55.205 region:rollup2
QUALIFIED NONPROFIT

01:02:53.603 --> 01:02:56.873 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS THAT IT IDENTIFIES

01:02:55.205 --> 01:02:59.476 region:rollup2
QUALIFIED FACILITY THE QUALIFIED

01:02:56.873 --> 01:03:00.677 region:rollup2
NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION.

01:02:59.476 --> 01:03:02.212 region:rollup2
THAT HAS TO DONATE.

01:03:00.677 --> 01:03:04.547 region:rollup2
THE ASSET TO THE DEPARTMENT

01:03:02.212 --> 01:03:06.116 region:rollup2
DEFENSE PURSUANT TO SECTION OF

01:03:04.547 --> 01:03:07.450 region:rollup2
UNITED STATES CODE OR THE TH

01:03:06.116 --> 01:03:08.785 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OFFENSE I THINK IT'S

01:03:07.450 --> 01:03:10.353 region:rollup2
PRETTY NARROW.

01:03:08.785 --> 01:03:12.355 region:rollup2
FAIR QUESTION OPENING QUESTION

01:03:10.353 --> 01:03:15.091 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S PRETTY NEARLY CRAFTED

01:03:12.355 --> 01:03:16.059 region:rollup2
OKAY SO THE AND THE HAD IT THAT

01:03:15.091 --> 01:03:18.061 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD MEAN THAT I THINK I

01:03:16.059 --> 01:03:19.429 region:rollup2
TO DATE HAVE TO DONATE THE

01:03:18.061 --> 01:03:20.397 region:rollup2
EQUIPMENT AS WELL.

01:03:19.429 --> 01:03:22.065 region:rollup2
IN ORDER TO GET THE TAX

01:03:20.397 --> 01:03:26.202 region:rollup2
EXEMPTION THEY COULD USE THE

01:03:22.065 --> 01:03:26.803 region:rollup2
EQUIPMENT LATER.

01:03:26.202 --> 01:03:28.204 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT AYE AYE

01:03:26.803 --> 01:03:29.372 region:rollup2
OFFICE IT BUT I THINK THEY CAN

01:03:28.204 --> 01:03:30.940 region:rollup2
GET UP THEY BUY IT OR DOES ARE

01:03:29.372 --> 01:03:32.409 region:rollup2
BUT ARE GONNA CERTAINLY DON'T

01:03:30.940 --> 01:03:33.610 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING GETS DONATED THAT'S

01:03:32.409 --> 01:03:35.812 region:rollup2
HOW CARRIE BEHIND IT AND THE

01:03:33.610 --> 01:03:36.946 region:rollup2
GHOST THE NONPROFIT AND THAT'S

01:03:35.812 --> 01:03:37.714 region:rollup2
THE ONLY REASON THEY GET THE

01:03:36.946 --> 01:03:39.082 region:rollup2
EXEMPTION SURE.
