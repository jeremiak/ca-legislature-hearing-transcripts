THE THE COMMITTEE ON ASSEMBLY COMMUNITY COMMUNICATIONS AND CONVEYANCE AS A SUB COMMITTEE BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A QUORUM. AND IS ONE OF THE AUTHORS IS HERE. ALSO WANTED KNOWLEDGE THAT IT'S THE AUTHORS BIRTHDAY -- MISTER WOOD. COMPLETELY -- UNCONVENTIONAL BUT NONE THE LESS HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU. IF YOU MIND START JUMPING UP HERE. UP ALSO WANT TO NOTICE UP ALSO WANT. TO WELCOME ONCE AGAIN -- MISTER OBERNOLTE HAD -- YOU'RE WELCOME IS A COUPLE WORDS BE LIKE WAS VICE CHAIR THAT'S ALWAYS AN HONOR TO BE HERE IN THE COMMUNICATIONS AND FINANCE COMMITTEE AND I'M LOOKING VERY MUCH. MUCH FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE AS WE MOVE FORWARD THIS YEAR. ALL ANNOUNCED IN ADVANCE THAT MR TEAM WILL BE THE SUBSTITUTE FOR MR GARCIA TODAY ONLY -- SO YOU MADE AGAINST WHAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE DEVASTATING FIRES THAT RAVAGED CALIFORNIA IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN THE STATE AND THE C. U. P. THE P. YOU SEE A C. P. YOU SEE HAVE FOCUS HEAVILY ON THE UTILITIES RESPONSE TO THE MASSIVE DESTRUCTION. HOWEVER LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE IMPACT THESE NATURAL DISASTERS HAD ON THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS NETWORKS AND HOW TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES HAVE RESPONDED. OUR COMMUNICATION SYSTEM IS VITAL FOR PUBLIC SAFETY YET AS WE HAVE SEEN DURING THE WILDFIRES IN THE LAST FEW YEARS IT'S ONE OF OUR WEAKEST LINKS. THIS SHOULD WORRY ALL OF US. I DON'T NEED TO TELL YOU THAT THE FREQUENCY AND INTENSITY AND SIZE OF THESE FIRES IS INCREASING AT AN ALARMING RATE. THERE'S GROWING NEED FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THE CPUC AND OTHER RELEVANT STATE AGENCIES AND THE PUBLIC'S NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE EXTENT AND THE TIMING OF THE RESTORATION EFFORTS OF INFRASTRUCTURE. AND ADEQUATE PREPARE FOR THE INEVITABLE FUTURE COMMUNICATIONS OUTAGES OUTAGES WHILE WE AGREE THAT THE CPUC HAS THE AUTHORITY TO COLLECT MUCH OF THE INFORMATION SPECIFIED IN THE BILL. THE CPUC IS NOT REQUIRED TO REDUCE PRODUCE SUCH A REPORT. ALTHOUGH THE CPUC OUR COMPLETE INVOLUNTARY SUMMARY OF THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN NORTH BAY FIRES BY THE C. P. UC'S OWN ADMISSION THEY BELIEVE THE REPORT NEEDED TO BE MORE COMPREHENSIVE AND DETAILED. THIS BILL WOULD ANSWER THEIR CALL FOR HELP BY GIVING THEM THE RESOURCES THEY NEED AND TO STRENGTHEN THEIR EXISTING AUTHORITY TO COLLECT MORE DETAILED INFORMATION. THE NEED FOR THIS BILL IS HIGHLIGHTED BY THE FACT THAT THE CPUC DID NOT PRODUCE A REPORT. ON COMMUNICATION OUTAGES FOR THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN CAN'T FIRE THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE FIRE IN STATE HISTORY. SEE IF YOU SEE A STATED IN THEIR ANALYSIS OF A PREVIOUS ITERATION OF THIS BILL FROM LAST SESSION. THAT THIS BILL PROPOSES A COMPREHENSIVE DETAILED REPORT AND ANNOUNCES OF AND ON AN ON AN ONGOING BASIS. SOME COUNTY WHICH IS IN MY DISTRICT CONDUCTED AN ALERT AND WARNING DISASTER TEST IN SEPTEMBER OF LAST YEAR TO BETTER PREPARE FOR FUTURE DISASTERS. REQUESTS WERE MADE TO SEVERAL WIRELESS PROVIDERS PROTESTED PAID IN THE EXERCISE AND PROVIDE CELL TOWER INFORMATION. THEY NEITHER PARTICIPATED IN THE TESTER PROVIDED DATA ACCORDING TO A REPORT COMMISSIONED BY CINEMA COUNTY. AB ONE EIGHTY THREE WOULD REQUIRE THE CPUC TO REPORT TO THE APPROPRIATE POLICY COMMITTEE OF THE LEGISLATURE THE IMPACT OF A NATURAL DISASTER ON THE STATE'S TELECOMMUNICATIONS NETWORK. AND RESPONSE HOTEL COMISKEY MCKAY COMMUNICATION COMPANIES LET ME BE CLEAR WHAT THIS BILL WILL NOT DO. THE BILL WOULD NOT REQUIRE TELECOMMUNICATION COMPANIES TO DIVULGE INFORMATION TO BE HARMFUL TO SECURITY SUCH AS DISCLOSURE ADDRESSES A PROPOSED NETWORK FACILITIES OR AN ITEMIZED LIST OF EQUIPMENT DEPLOYED. EXISTING LAW UNDER P. YOU SEE -- CODE SECTION THREE OH FOUR REQUIRES IT OF ANY INFORMATION. PERCENT OF THIS BILL IS DEEMED TO POSE A SECURITY THREAT THE CPUC WOULD HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO WITHHOLD SUB SUCH INFORMATION FROM THE PUBLIC. ADDITIONAL THIS BILL IS NOT A MANDATE ON REAL TIME COLLECTION OF DATA SPECIFIED IN THE REPORT. I'M HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT AND ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AS REGION ACOSTA WITH TURN. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE UTILITY REFORM NETWORK AND FOR THE LAST FORTY YEARS. WE HAVE REPRESENTED THE INTERESTS OF CALIFORNIA UTILITY CUSTOMERS INCLUDING TELEPHONE CUSTOMERS. AND ONE OF THE CORE ESSENTIAL ISSUES OF OUR WORK HAS BEEN ALWAYS TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE RELIABLE UBIQUITOUS COMMUNICATION BECAUSE IT'S SO ESSENTIAL. TO THE ABILITY TO CONTACT EMERGENCY OFFICIALS. IN TO RECEIVE ALERTS BUT IT'S ALSO CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE INDUSTRY THAT SUPPORTS MANY ASPECTS OF PUBLIC SAFETY. AND AS EXPLAINED BY SOME WOMEN WOULD WITH THE CHANGES IN OUR ENVIRONMENT AND THE OUTGROWTH OF THESE LARGE FIRES THIS IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER. I MEAN IT AB ONE EIGHTY THREE AT ITS ESSENCE. IS A BILL THAT WOULD HELP ALL OF US MAKE SURE THAT NO NEIGHBORHOOD OR COMMUNITY IS LEFT BEHIND. IN THE AFTERMATH OF A MAJOR DISASTER THAT DAMAGES TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES IT WOULD ALLOW MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE LOCAL AND REGIONAL AUTHORITIES TO ENSURE THAT ALL COMMUNITIES ARE RECONNECTED. ARM IT PROVIDES KEY PUBLIC SAFETY INFORMATION THAT'S CURRENTLY LACKEY. ARM FOR EXAMPLE OFFER DISTRICTS THAT ARE IMPACTED BY A WILDFIRE THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO OBTAIN. INFORMATION ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE CRITICAL COMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE BOB SO THAT THEY CAN FOR INSTANCE VERIFY THE EFFORTS TO RESTORE THE SERVICE DETERMINE WHETHER THE RESTORATION IS ADEQUATE AND TRULY MEETS THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY. UP THEY CAN USE THE DATA TO SUPPORT LOCAL AND REGIONAL EFFORTS TO MITIGATE FUTURE DAMAGE TO CRITICAL FACILITIES AND BY DOING SO. THAT INFORMATION IS ALSO USEFUL FOR SHORING UP AN IMPROVING OUR NINE ONE ONE ALERT SYSTEM. ARMED. THIS INFORMATION IS NOT ROUTINELY AVAILABLE TODAY. WE DON'T HAVE AS ASSEMBLYMAN WOULD POINTED OUT WE DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION ON THE CAMPFIRE. WE HAVE A LOT OF INFORMATION ON CINEMA AND THEN TO SEE NO COUNTIES BECAUSE THOSE COUNTIES TOOK IT UPON THEMSELVES TO GATHER THE INFORMATION. ON THAT IS A TRIBUTE IN CONGRATULATIONS TO THOSE COUNTIES BUT THE REST OF CALIFORNIA ALSO NEEDS TO BE ABLE. TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPACTS OF IT'S A MAJOR WILDFIRE. ON THE EXPERIENCES OF FIRST RESPONDERS AND THOSE THAT RESIDE IN THE AREAS WHERE THESE EMERGENCIES HAVE DAMAGED COMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES. AND DISRUPTED SERVICE HAVE MADE IT CLEAR THAT THE VOLUNTARY MEASURES ARE JUST NOT ADEQUATE AND THAT INCLUDES THE PROVISION OF INFORMATION -- IT'S ESSENTIAL THAT OUR LOCAL AND REGIONAL AUTHORITIES OF A COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING AND AND THE LEGISLATURE'S A COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING. OF THE IMPACTS OF THESE FIRES AND BE ABLE TO VERIFY THAT IN FACT THE SERVICES RESTORED. THE RESEARCHER MEMBERS -- IGNITES YOUR HERNANDEZ ON BEHALF OF THE COMMUNICATION WORKERS OF AMERICA DISTRICT NINE AND ALSO ON BEHALF OF THE CONSUMER FEDERATION OF CALIFORNIA. IN SUPPORT THINK THE ONLY THING THAT I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT AND MENTION IT IS IN FACT WHAT THE PRIOR WITNESS. ADDRESSED WHICH IS THIS IS REALLY ABOUT ENSURING THAT CERTAIN COMMUNITIES AND NEIGHBORHOODS NOT LEFT BEHIND -- THERE'VE BEEN A NUMBER OF EXAMPLES OVER THE YEARS NOT JUST THE WILDFIRES BUT ALSO STE -- STORMS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WEATHER OUTAGES TO TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES AND AFTER. OF THE STORM IS OVER THERE WAS A LOT OF CONFLICTING INFORMATION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT SERVICES BEEN RESTORED IN ALL COMMUNITIES IN ALL NEIGHBORHOODS. ON THERE'S REALLY NO CENTRAL LOCATION TO OBTAIN THAT INFORMATION -- THERE'S NO REPORT TO TURN TO SO THAT EVERYONE CAN BE ASSURED BOTH -- LEGISLATORS AND COMMUNITY ALIKE. THAT THAT IN FACT SERVICE HAS BEEN RESTORED WHAT IT TOOK TO RESTORE -- OR IF THERE INDIVIDUALS ARE COMMITTEES THAT ARE STILL LEFT WITHOUT SERVICE -- AFTER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT THIS BILL IS GEARED. TO DOING ITS VERY NARROW AS FAR AS UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES THIS REPORT AS INFORMATION BE COLLECTED AND REPORTED THE LEGISLATURE. BUT I CAN TELL YOU I THINK THE NEED FOR IT IS REALLY EXEMPLIFIED. IF WE BROUGHT IN HERE INDIVIDUALS OF WERE IMPACTED BY THE WILDFIRES ARE IMPACTED BY A NUMBER OF OTHER -- YOU KNOW DECLARED EMERGENCIES AND IF THEY ASKED YOU WHETHER OR NOT YOU KNEW OR TURN CAN TURN TO SOMETHING TO PROVE AND TO SHOW. THAT SERVICE HAD BEEN RESTORED IN ALL COMMUNITIES AND WHAT IT TOOK TO DO THAT AND WHEN THAT HAPPENED -- I I WOULD IMAGINE THAT YOU DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION AND RIGHT NOW WE CAN'T POINT TO ANYWHERE TO OBTAIN THAT INFORMATION IN AN EASILY ACCESSIBLE MANNER. THIS WOULD ENSURE THE INFORMATION FLOWS AS THE SOMEONE NUMBER MENTIONED THIS IS NOT REAL TIME COLLECTION WHICH WE KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW TO DO THAT THIS IS AFTER THE FACT. AND THIS IS A WAY TO ENSURE. THAT EVERYONE IS COVERED NO COMMUNITIES ARE LEFT BEHIND IN A WAY TO PREPARE GOING FORWARD SO FOR THOSE REASONS BORN SUPPORT THE BILL [inaudible] CORPORATE. THANK YOU ARE NOTICING THAT THERE'S A QUORUM -- PRESENT MADAM SECRETARY -- PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. SANTIAGO [inaudible] OBERNOLTE. BUT A WHOLE THAT FEAR BONTA [inaudible] PRO [inaudible] CERVANTES [inaudible] TING [inaudible] HOLDEN [inaudible] KAMLAGER-DOVE [inaudible] LOW [inaudible] PATTERSON [inaudible] QUIRK SILVA [inaudible] RODRIGUEZ. WE HAVE A FOUR THANK YOU HAVE A QUORUM ALSO NOTICING THE MISTER -- BRO HAS NOW JOINED THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU. FOR PARTICIPATING AND THIS IS A BEEN A **** BATH THANK BOERNER HORVATH THANK YOU. A B. H. FOR SHORT [inaudible] TV [inaudible] EIGHT TBH. I'M ANY ADDITIONAL WILL -- WITNESSES SUPPORT. DEAR SANDERS REPRESENTING THE PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE FORMALLY THE OFFICER REPAIR ADVOCATES WERE IN STRONG SUPPORT AT EIGHTY ONE EIGHTY THREE THANK YOU. MAIN OPPOSITION WITNESSES MISTER CHAIRMAN THANKS. LEVINE REPRESENTING AT AND T. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND HIS STAFF FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH THEM OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS. IN DISCUSSING DIFFERENT AMENDMENTS TO THE LEGISLATION UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE NOT REACHED A COMMON GROUND ON THIS BILL AND SO THEREFORE WE REMAIN OPPOSED -- TODAY THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION AS YOU'VE HEARD FREQUENTLY HAS BROAD AUTHORITY TO COLLECT NETWORK INFORMATION IT DEEMS NECESSARY TO INVESTIGATE OUTAGES. AND NETWORK PERFORMANCE. BOTH DURING. AND AFTER DECLARED EMERGENCIES I MIGHT ALSO ADD THAT EIGHTEEN T. IS ONE OF MANY AS ALL TELEPHONE COMPANIES ARE CARRIERS OF LAST RESORT WHERE WE ARE REQUIRED BY LAW. TO RESTORE ALL SERVICES TO COMMUNITIES AND WERE REQUIRED TO BE ACT OR BETTER THAN THE SERVICES PRIOR TO THE DISASTER. THE P.YOU SEE ALSO HAS THE AUTHORITY TO REQUEST DATA ON COMPETITIVE SERVICES THAT THEY DO NOT REGULATE. AND SO AS A RESULT IT'S VERY VERY IMPORTANT THAT KEY INFORMATION. THAT IS NON REGULATED COMPETITIVE OR PROPRIETARY OR RELATED TO HOMELAND SECURITY. BE MAINTAINED AS CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION NOW WHAT WAS NOT MENTIONED HERE TODAY IS RECENTLY. THE P. YOU SEE REFORMED ITS RULES. SIXTY SIXTY REFORM IT'S RULES ON HOW IT WILL TREAT. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION RELATED TO THESE TYPES OF DISASTERS AND SO IN SOME INSTANCES INFORMATION COULD BE READILY MADE AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC AND IN OTHER INSTANCESIT MUST REMAIN CONFIDENTIAL BUT THERE IS A PROCESS OF FOR DUE PROCESS. FOR INFORMATION TO BE RELEASED IF IT'S DEEMED UP PUBLIC A BY THE COMMISSION -- WE BELIEVE ONE EIGHTY THREE MISTER WOODS BILL WOULD UNDERCUT THE BALANCE OF THE FRAMEWORK THAT I JUST DESCRIBED. BY EXEMPTING ANNUAL REPORTS FROM EXISTING CONFIDENTIALITY SAFEGUARDS. IN ADDITION WE BELIEVE IT IGNORES ROBUST DISASTER RESPONSE PROCESSES ALREADY IN PLACE AND CLEAR PUBLIC VIEW. THE FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE IS BUILDING INFRASTRUCTURE -- ARE AND A STRONG NETWORK WHEN OUR CONSTRUCTION TEAMS BUILD CELL SITES IN DISASTER PRONE AREAS ALL OF THEM ALL OF THEM ARE BUILT TO MEET OR EXCEED STATE STRUCTURAL STANDARDS. THROUGH THE MULTIPLE WILDFIRES ACROSS CALIFORNIA. IN RECENT YEARS WE HAVE DEPLOYED HUNDREDS OF TECHNICIANS AND A STATEWIDE FLEET OF MOBILE EMERGENCY FACILITIES WHERE INFRASTRUCTURE IS DAMAGED THE IDEA THAT WE LEAVE CONSTITUENCIES WITHOUT SERVICE. IS NOT REFLECTED IN THE REALITY. EVEN AS THE WILD FIRES RAGED ACROSS CALIFORNIA. WE PROVIDE MOBILE PHONES CHARGING STATIONS AND SATELLITE BASED WIRELESS SITES. TO BOTH FIRST RESPONDERS AS WELL AS IMPACTED CONSTITUENCIES. JUST LAST MONTH WE HAD ON THE LAWN OF THE CAPITOL THE EIGHTEEN T. DISASTER RECOVERY TEAM. WITH PROFESSIONAL TECHNICIANS TO DEMONSTRATE THE KINDS OF CAPABILITIES THAT WE BRING. TO THESE EMERGENCY SERVICES AND I MIGHT ADD ALL OF THAT IS DONE AT THE COMPANY'S EXPENSE. NO STATE AGENCY I KNOW LOCAL AGENCY NOR ANY CONSUMER IS EVER BUILD FOR THE KINDS OF SERVICES THAT WE DO IN TERMS OF IMMEDIATE SERVICE AS WELL AS RESTORATION OF SERVICES. SO AS A RESULT WE DON'T BELIEVE THIS BILL IS NECESSARY AND THEREFORE AT THIS TIME WE OPPOSE THE LEGISLATION. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS BERNIE OROZCO WITH CABLE ASSOCIATION. ONE A PIGGYBACK OFF WOOD MISTER DEVINE HAS SAID SO BASICALLY WHAT YOU HAVE TODAY IS UNDER CURRENT STATUTE THE P. C.'S ABILITY TO GET THIS TYPE OF INFORMATION THEY HAVE THAT THERE'S THREE CODE SECTIONS THAT ALLOW THEM TODAY. TO GET THAT INFORMATION AND THEY CAN PUT THAT IN THERE AND REPORT. MIKE LIKE MR LINE SAID THERE'S ALSO ANOTHER CODE SECTION FIVE EIGHT THREE THAT MAKE SURE THAT THAT INFORMATION IS CONFIDENTIAL ONLY RELEASE IF IT'S APPROPRIATE TO RELEASE THAT INFORMATION. SO AS FAR AS HIS BILL THAT PIECES DOESN'T THE IS UNNECESSARY. BUT WHAT THIS BILL ASKS FOR BEYOND WHAT IS ON THE CURRENT LAW IT ASKS FOR THE TYPE OF FACILITIES THAT ARE BEING RESTORED. AND I LISTEN TO THE PROPONENTS SOLICITED AUTHORED A SAID WHAT PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW WHAT'S COMING BACK WHAT'S COMING IN BUT WE JUST TALK ABOUT THAT BEING CONFIDENTIAL IT'S A COMPETITIVE MARKET. I WOULD LOVE NOTHING MORE THAN TO KNOW WHAT MR DEVINE'S DOING HIS BUSINESS SO THAT I CAN COMPETE WITH HIM IF I THINK HE I HAVE A BETTER PRODUCT AND WHAT HE HAS. I WILL SWOOP IN AND COMPETE WITH HIM BUT EVERYONE HAS ONLY SO MUCH CAPITAL FOR THEIR FACILITIES EXPANSION. SO HAVING THAT TYPE OF INFORMATION MADE PUBLIC TO THE LEGISLATURE THROUGH THIS PROCESS IS INAPPROPRIATE IT'S A COMPETITIVE MARKET. IF ANYTHING THIS BILL IS SORT OF A SLIGHT AT THE P. YOU SEE THAT THEY HAVE NOT DONE WHAT THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN DOING I THINK I THINK I'VE HEARD THAT SAID A COUPLE TIMES HERE. AND I LISTEN TO PROPONENTS WHO PARTICIPATED IN WILL MAKE IS THAT -- WILL MAKE IS WORKSHOPS AT THE P. YOU SEE. THIS STUFF COULD BE TO DISCUSS THEIR AT THAT TIME THAT IS THE APPROPRIATE MOMENT TO BRING THAT INFORMATION UP. WE HAVE HAD A NUMBER OF PROCEEDINGS AT THE P. YOU SEE WHERE WE'VE TALKED ABOUT FIRES AND WE'VE TALKED ABOUT WERE APPROPRIATE RESPONSES AND EVERYONE HAS WEIGHED IN ON THAT. THIS BILL COMPLEX WITH THOSE EFFORTS. IF THIS BILL PASSES IT CONFLICTS WITH WHAT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON FOR A COUPLE YEARS NOW SO THE WILDFIRES HAS GENERATED A LOT OF WORK AT THE PC. AND THIS DOES NOTHING MORE THAN TO COMPETE WITH THAT. SO IT'S ALREADY AUTHORIZED UNDER CURRENT LAW FOR INFORMATION IT CAN ALREADY BE SHARED IF IT'S DEEMED APPROPRIATE UNDER PUBLIC UTILITIES CONSTRUCTION. FIVE EIGHTY THREE WHAT THIS ASK FOR IS TO MAKE PROPRIETARY INFORMATION AVAILABLE. AND TO SHARE THAT WITH OTHERS SO THE COMMUNITY KNOWS WHAT IS BEING RESTORED THAT WE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT'S WHAT WE'RE POSTED. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION WITNESSES. A MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS STEVE CARLSON FOR C. K. A THE WIRELESS INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION. I WANTED TO KIND OF TAKE A LITTLE DIFFERENT DIRECTION HERE -- I'LL BE BRIEF -- THE SUGGESTION IS AND I KNOW IT WASN'T -- MISTER WHAT SUGGESTION BUT THE SUGGESTION FROM THE SOME OF THE WITNESSES SAID THAT SOMEHOW OR OTHER. THE INDUSTRY IS SLOW TO RESPOND SLOW TO RESTORE -- NOT DOING THEIR JOB -- WE TAKE SOME OF THE BRIDGE AT THAT -- MY THINK OF MR DEVINE INDICATED OF THE WIRELESS CARRIERS HAVE DONE AN UNBELIEVABLE JOB COMING BACK IN AFTERWARDS -- ACTUALLY WARNING BEFOREHAND COMING BACK IN AFTERWARDS AND THERE'S EVERY INTEREST IN THE WORLD FOR THEM TO DO THAT NOT. PARTLY IT'S HUMANITARIAN THE OTHER PART IS COMPETITIVE YOU WANT TO GET YOUR SYSTEM BACK UP AND IN LINE SO YOU'RE BECAUSE SO YOU HAVE CUSTOMERS AGAIN SO. WE UNDERSTAND WHERE MISTER WHAT'S COMING FROM THIS AND WE CERTAINLY SYMPATHIZE WITH EVERYTHING HIS DISTRICT AS GOD THROUGH BUT WE JUST DON'T THINK THIS IS THE APPROPRIATE APPROACH THANK YOU. ACTUALLY STATED THIS BEFORE A MASS FOR NAME ORGANIZATION POSITION ONLY I DIDN'T WANNA STOP THE FIRST PERSON THAT IN STATE THAT BUT I'LL DO THAT FROM HERE ON OUT THANKS. THIS CHAIR REMEMBERS DOMINIC TOMARI OF HERE ON BEHALF OF FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS. FOR THE REASONS PREVIOUSLY STATED WE ALSO OPPOSE THE BILL. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE ACCURACY ON BEHALF OF VERIZON ALSO RESPECTFULLY HAVE TO OPPOSE THIS BILL THANK YOU. ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. YES WAS OBERNOLTE I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF THE SOMEONE WHAT I WANTED TO GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND TO SOME OF THE ASSERTIONS MADE BY THE OPPOSITION -- ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT THEY REYES AND IT'S A CONCERN THAT I SHARE IS THIS CONCERN OVER A LACK OF CONFIDENTIALITY. THROUGH THIS ALTERNATIVE PATHWAY FOR THE RELEASE OF INFORMATION ANDA ONE OF THE EXAMPLES I WAS THINKING ABOUT. IS IF A TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANY HAD INFRASTRUCTURE DESTROYED IN A NATURAL DISASTER. AND THEN. CHOSE TO INSTALL AN UPGRADED INFRASTRUCTURE WHEN THEY WHO IN RESPONSE NATIONAL DISASTER THAT ENABLE THEM TO COMPETE IN ANOTHER MARKET LIKE ALSO PROVIDE. INTERNET SERVICE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT -- ISN'T THAT VALUABLE INFORMATION THAT THEY WOULDN'T WANT THEIR COMPETITORS TO HAVE. SO I I JUST WONDER IF THERE ISN'T SOME MIDDLE GROUND HERE THAT WE CAN GET TO A PLACE WHERE WE'RE WE'RE NOT RELEASING THAT INFORMATION THAT THEY CONSIDER CONFIDENTIAL. HI I THAT IS NOT MY INTENT TO READ TO YOU KNOW TO RELEASE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION -- CERTAINLY FROM THE STANDPOINT OF SECURITY AS WELL AS PROPRIETARY INFORMATION THAT IS NOT THAT'S NOT THE INTENT AT ALL SO IF THERE IS IF THERE IS A LACK OF CLARITY THERE ARE MORE THAN HAPPY CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION. TO CLARIFY THAT THAT IS NOT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS GET INFORMATION ABOUT THE DISASTER -- HOW CAN WE IMPROVE I MEAN DOES ANYBODY? DO WE NOT WANT TO LEARN FROM FROM DISASTERS AND MAKE THINGS BETTER -- AND WITHOUT A DETAILED REPORT ON WHAT HAPPENED HOW MANY PEOPLE WENT OUT HOW LONG WERE THEY OUT -- WHERE WERE THE OUTAGES HOW DO WE LEARN FROM THAT FROM IN THE PAST WHERE DO WE GO BACK AND REBUILD EXIT THINGS EXACTLY THE WAY WE BUILT THEM -- AND IN THE FUTURE AND HOPE FOR DIFFERENT RESULT IN THE FUTURE SO -- AND I WOULD I WOULD SAY ALSO YOU KNOW I THINK THERE IS A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN IN AN URBAN AREA AND WHAT WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN IN A RURAL AREA. SO WE HAVE A BIG STORMS AND THINGS ALL THE TIME IN OUR AREA AND I WILL TELL YOU -- QUITE FRANKLY WE DO HEAR FROM CONSUMERS -- FREQUENTLY -- THAT WOW BUT I'VE BEEN WITHOUT MY SERVICE FOR TWO THREE WEEKS -- YOU KNOW AND I KNOW I RECOGNIZE IT'S DIFFICULT SOMETIMES FOR CARRIERS TO GET THERE BUT IT ISN'T LIKE WHAT HAPPENS IN IN AN URBAN AREA WHERE SERVICE CAN GET UP PRETTY QUICKLY -- YOU KNOW I SAY THIS OFTEN YOU KNOW IN IN MANY MY AREAS SOMETIMES WORK WORK WORK WE'RE HAPPY WITH ONE GEE I JUST NOTICED ON MY PHONE I GOT FIVE G. NOW I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I DID KNOW THAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN. BUT WE DON'T WE DON'T HAVE WE DON'T HAVE ROBUST ACTIVE ACCESS AND AND I YOU KNOW I HAVE I HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS JUST IN GENERAL ABOUT -- HOW HOW SOME OF THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS MIGHT WORK I WAS FAR AS EMERGENCY ALERTS AND HOW CAN WE IMPROVE UPON THAT WE HAD BIG WE WHEN CERTAIN TOWERS MIGHT GO DOWN IT MIGHT AFFECT THE ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE? IN THE MOST RECENT DISASTER IN OUR DISTRICT -- OF FLOODING IN AND THE BULLS THE LITTLE CITY OF GARDEN GO. THAT'S NOT A BIG CITY IS FOUR THOUSAND FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE OUT THERE. ON A GOOD DAY THEY HAVE TERRIBLE CELL COVERAGE. AND IT WAS A HUGE PROBLEM FOR FEMA AND YES AND OUR EMERGENCY RESPONDERS TO TO T. EVEN COMMUNICATE. NOT TO THE CREDIT OF THE CARRIERS AND I AND I AND I'M VERY THANKFUL FOR THAT THEY DID DEPLOY -- OR UNITS AS MUCH AS AS MISTER DEVINE SAID THAT'S GREAT AND SO FOR ABOUT A WEEK. THE PEOPLE IN THE RIVER COMMITTEE HAD THE BEST CELL PHONE COVERAGE THEY'VE EVER EXPERIENCED IN OUR LIFE. AND IT'S GONE NOW. BUT OF THE SO -- YOU KNOW AND THAT'S JUST THE NATURE OF THE SOME SAID THAT THE WERE WE LIVE IN SO IS NOT MY DESIRE TO TO EXPOSE ANYBODY'S PROPRIETARY INFORMATION MY DESIRE TO SEE. THAT THINGS GET REBUILT -- IN A WAY THAT WE LEARNED FROM ART FROM THE HISTORY OF OF THESE INCIDENTS AND THAT WE CAN IMPROVE FOR EVERYBODY SICK. OUT CERTAINLY SEEMS LIKE WE'RE ALL ON THE SAME PAGE ABOUT THAT SO I WANT TO ENCOURAGE YOU. AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION BECAUSE I'LL BE RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TODAY BECAUSE OF MY CONCERNS BUT I WOULD LOVE TO GET TO A PLACE WHERE. WE COULD A PROTECT THE INFORMATION THAT THEY CONSIDER CONFIDENTIAL AND STILL BE ABLE -- TO PUBLICLY CONSIDERED HOW BEST TO RESPOND TO THESE DISASTERS ABSOLUTELY. I TBH AS ALL PRIVATE NON. THANK YOU -- I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR THIS BILL -- I THINK YOU KNOW WE DO ALL WANT TO LEARN FROM DISASTERS AND I WANT TO ASK THE AUTHOR FIRST OF ALL -- WE'VE HEARD THAT THE CPC CAN'T ALREADY COLLECT THIS INFORMATION -- DID YOU REVIEW THAT DATA COLLECTION HAS IT HAPPENED IS IS. MORE OF A PROBLEM THE CPUC I THINK IT'S CHALLENGES IS RESOURCES QUITE FRANKLY -- SI PC AFTER THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN FIRES DID DID DO A REPORT -- AND I THINK YOU AS YOU HEARD FROM -- MY WITNESS HERE -- AT THE CINEMA COUNTY MENDOCINO COUNTY -- DOODLE COLLECTED A LOT OF A LOT OF INFORMATION BUT THEY WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE DONE A DEEPER DIVE QUITE FRANKLY. AND THERE HAS BEEN NO REPORT ON THE TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN FIRES BIG AND THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT SO PART OF THIS IS IS IS RESOURCES AND SO. SORE ASKING FOR INFORMATION PRESSING FOR INFORMATION FROM THE CARRIERS TO HELP. HELP US TO LEARN FROM THESE THESE -- THESE DISASTERS. THANK YOU -- I I SYMPATHIZE WITH THE ISSUES ANY IN YOUR DISTRICT AND I APPRECIATE YOU BRING UP THE ISSUE BETWEEN. URBAN AND RURAL AREAS AND I THINK EVEN HAD SOMEBODY -- WENT AND SPEAK OUR US SOMEBODY SPEAK -- TALKING ABOUT IN URBAN AREAS THERE'S SO MUCH COMPETITION. THAT THEY WILL GET RESTORED NATIONALLY -- AND I'M NOT SURE THIS INFORMATION WHICH IS A LOT OF GATHERING OF INFORMATION ABOUT THE STATE. STATE IS NECESSARY AND MORE URBAN AREAS I DO SEE THERE'S AN ISSUE -- WITH RURAL AREAS THERE'S ALWAYS AN ISSUE WITH ROLL COVERAGE -- I THINK THAT'S A KIND OF A WORLDWIDE ISSUE AND NOT JUST -- CALIFORNIA UNITED STATES -- SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH INCOME OPPOSITION AND REALLY YOU KNOW IF THERE'S A WAY TO DRAW DOWN ON LESS INFORMATION HOW TO BE REPORTED IT'S GREAT THAT YOU WANT TO WORK WITH OPPOSITION. AROUND THE PROPRIETARY THING BECAUSE I THINK THAT IS SOMETHING WAS REALLY. VALID -- AS WELL AS NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUES -- YOU KNOW THOSE THOSE ARE THINGS ALL THE AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TODAY BUT I'M I'M LOOKING FOR TO YOU WORKING WITH. FOLKS ON THIS AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET TO A PLACE OF YES. ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS. WE WOULD NEED A FIRST AND A SECOND [inaudible] SECOND. ANY CLOSING COMMENTS.

FIFTEEN FOURTEEN THAT WILL MAKE A SUPPOSED SIMPLE CHANGE TO THE PUBLIC UTILITIES CODE. A HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES CLARIFYING AMENDMENTS APPRECIATE THEM CALIFORNIA CPUC OPERATES MULTIPLE DEAF AND DISABLED TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROGRAMS ONE OF THOSE BEING THE CALIFORNIA PHONES PROGRAM THIS PROGRAM% SERVES MORE THAN. FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE DEAF OR DISABLED PROVIDING THEM WITH TELEPHONES IT MAY HAVE LARGER BUTTONS TO MAKE DIALING EASIER YOU'RE ALL FAMILIAR WITH THE APPLICATIONS. THIS APPLICANTS TO THE PROGRAM MUST HAVE A HEALTH CARE PROVIDER CERTIFIED THEIR NEED SIGN OFF ON THEIR APPLICATIONS CURRENT STATUTE IDENTIFIES POSITIONS SPEAKS LANGUAGE PATHOLOGIST. APAMA TRISTEN POSITION ASSISTANCE HAS CERTIFIED PROVIDERS OF THE CURRENT LIST EXCLUDES NURSE PRACTICAL PRACTITIONERS WHO OFTEN SERVE AS THE FRONTLINE PROVIDED MANY COMMUNITIES WITH. PHYSICIAN SHORTAGES A PARTICULARLY IN RURAL PARTS OF THE STATE. A TOP DATING THE CO TWO NURSE PRACTITIONERS TO THE LIST OF CERTIFIED PROVIDERS. IS REALLY A SIMPLE FIX THAT'S GOING TO ENSURE ACCESS TO THE PROGRAM DOES NOT IMPEDE. FOR VULNERABLE INDIVIDUALS IN CALIFORNIA REGULARLY SEE A NURSE PRACTITIONER FOR THEIR PRIMARY CARE NEEDS HERE WITH ME TODAY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL IS CHRISTY WISE. REPRESENTED THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF NURSE PRACTITIONERS AND THE CAP THE RENTAL A NURSE PRACTITIONER AND ASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF NURSING AT FRESNO STATE. WELL FIRST. WELL FIRST A SECOND. ANY ADDITIONAL SUPPORT WHAT IS THIS. HI MY NAME IS KATHERINE DUNCAN AFTERNOON I SERVE ON THE LEGISLATIVE OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE FOR THE WORST LEADERSHIP COALITION FRESNO. I'M ALSO PRACTICING NURSE PRACTITIONER THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AB. FIFTEEN FOURTEEN LOOKING AT THE RED ORIGINAL PUBLIC UTILITY CODE TWO EIGHT EIGHT ONE I THINK IT WAS JUST AN OVERSIGHT THAT NURSE PRACTITIONERS A LAPTOP THIS CODE. I HAVE TWO REASONS FOR THIS FIRST THE CALIFORNIA CODE OF PRACTICE POLICY THE GENDER PRISON SECTION FIVE THREE EIGHT ZERO ZERO IDENTIFIES PRIMERICA BUYERS AS PHYSICIANS NON PHYSICIANS. NURSE PRACTITIONERS AND PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTS. THESE PRATER PROVIDERS HAVE THE AUTHORITY PROVIDE PRIMARY CARE WITHIN THE SCOPE OTHER PRACTICE INCLUDING REFERRALS. BASED ON THIS CALIFORNIA PRACTICE POLICY CODE IF ASSISTANCE ASSISTANCE WHO IS THE MIDDLE OF A PROVIDER. HAS THE AUTHORITY TO CERTIFIED INDIVIDUALS NEED AND SIGN THE APPLICATION FOR THIS PROGRAM THEN IT STANDS TO REASON THE NURSE PRACTITIONER ALSO A MIDDLE OF A PROVIDER. SHOULD ALSO BE ABLE TO DO AS WELL. SECONDLY THE CALIFORNIA BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONAL CODE ARTICLE EIGHT SECTION THREE A TWO EIGHT THREE SIX POINT ONE STATES. NEITHER THIS CHAPTER OR ANY OTHER PROVISION OF LAW SHALL BE CONSTRUED TO PROHIBIT A NURSE PRACTITIONER FROM FOR NURSING FORWARDING DRUGS OR DEVICES. ONE OF THE FOLLOWING APPLY THIS MEANS IN ACCORDANCE WITH STANDARDIZED PROCEDURES BETWEEN THE NURSE PRACTITIONER IN THE POSITION. AND THE DRUGS AND DEVICES ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE PRACTITIONERS EDUCATIONAL AND CLINICAL COMPETENCY. BASED ON THIS CALIFORNIA CODE DIAGNOSING PRESCRIBING TREATING AN ORDER THREE MEDICAL DEVICES AS WELL WITHIN THE NURSE PRACTITIONER SCOPE OF PRACTICE. UPDATING THE POLICY OF THE UTILITY CO TO INCLUDE NURSE PRACTITIONERS TO LIST TO CERTIFY PROVIDERS WILL NOT ONLY CORRECT THIS OVERSIGHT. IT WILL ALSO MORE IMPORTANTLY ENSURE ACCESS TO THIS PROGRAM FOR QUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS IN BOTH RURAL AND URBAN AREAS WHO TYPICALLY HAVE ACCESS TO ONLY A NURSE PRACTITIONER AS A PRIME PROVIDER. I TO RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE FOR A. B. FIFTEEN FOURTEEN THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

NINE ELEVEN CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY IS HOME TO EIGHT MILLION PERSON PEOPLE WHO ARE EITHER OLDER ADULTS. ARE PERSONS WITH MOBILITY CENTURY INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENTAL AND OR MENTAL HEALTH DISABILITIES. THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE CONSIDERED AT RISK WHO HAVE UNIQUE NEEDS. AND REGULARLY REQUIRE SPECIAL ACCOMMODATIONS ESPECIALLY DURING CASES OF EMERGENCY WERE THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO CLEARLY COMMUNICATE WITH FOR FOR SPONSORS. IN ORDER TO BEST SERVE THOSE WHO NEED. WHO NEED HELP AND MINIMIZE ANY RISK OF INJURY IT IS CRITICAL THAT OFFER FOR SPONSORS FIRED LAW ENFORCEMENT EMS? BE PROVIDED WITH A PERSON'S VITAL HEALTH INFORMATION PART ARRIVING ON SCENE. AB NINE ELEVEN WERE DIRECT CAL -- YES TO ESTABLISH A SMART. NINE ONE ONE TYPE SYSTEM THAT ENABLES AT RISK INDIVIDUALS TO VOLUNTARY DISCLOSE IMPORTANT. HEALTH INFORMATION TO BE AVAILABLE TO FIRST RESPONDERS. HOW THE INFORMATION WOULD INCLUDE MEDICAL CONDITIONS AND MEDICATIONS PHOTOGRAPHS AND EMERGENCY CONTACTS EACH BEING A CRITICAL PIECE OF INFORMATION FOR OUR FIRST RESPONDERS? MEMBERS I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT EVEN THOUGH CALIFORNIA'S CURRENT UPGRADING ITS NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM TO NEXT GEN TECHNOLOGY. WILL BE CAPABLE OF PERFORMING THE FUNCTIONS OF A SMART NINE ONE SYSTEM AT DESCRIBED IN THIS BILL. WITH ME TODAY PROVIDE TESTIMONY IS JAMIE HUDSON A DISPATCHER WHAT THE ELK GROVE POLICE DEPARTMENT. AND AFTER DOING A GOT FROM U. D. W. [inaudible] THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS JAMIE HUDSON A DISPATCH SUPERVISOR FOR THE OAK GROVE POLICE DEPARTMENT. I'M ALSO THE STATE COORDINATOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA TELE COMMUNICATOR EMERGENCY RESPONSE TASKFORCE WHICH IS OUR STATE'S DISPATCH MUTUAL AID PROGRAM. I'VE BEEN A DISPATCHER FOR TWENTY SIX YEARS. ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO THE GROW POLICE DEPARTMENT PARTNERED WITH THE COMPANY TO OFFER A SMART NINE ONE ONE SERVICE TO THE CITIZENS OF ELK GROVE. THE DESIRE WAS TO OFFER A SYSTEM WHICH ALLOWED VOLUNTARY PROFILE CREATION FOR CITIZENS. WHO WANTED OUR NINE ONE ONE DISPATCHERS TO HAVE ACCESS TO PARTICULAR INFORMATION IF ANY OF THEIR REGISTERED TELEPHONE NUMBERS CALLED NINE ONE ONE FROM WITHIN OUR JURISDICTION? THIS WAS RESULT OF OUR AGENCY WANTING TO OFFER MORE COMPREHENSIVE SERVICES TO A VARIETY OF COMMUNITY MEMBERS WITH DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES OR NEEDS. FOR INSTANCE WE WANTED A FASTER WAY FOR CALLERS FROM OUR DEAF COMMUNITY TO COMMUNICATE INITIAL INFORMATION TO US. WE ALSO WANTED PARENTS OF JUVENILE AND DEPENDENT ADULTS. BECAUSE HE'S BEEN DEPENDENT CHILDREN TO BE ABLE TO STORE PICTURES OF THEIR CHILDREN IN CASE THEY WENT MISSING. AND LASTLY WE WANTED OUR COMMUNITY TO TELL US ANY VOLUNTARY INFORMATION RELATED TO POTENTIAL HEALTH CONDITIONS AND HOUSING ACCESS INFORMATION. TO MAKE ANY RESPONSE TO THEM MORE EFFICIENT. THE DRAWBACK THAT ELK GROVE EXPERIENCED IN THIS WAS LIMITED GEOGRAPHICAL AREA THAT THE SYSTEM WAS AVAILABLE AND THAT OUR INITIAL GOAL WAS TO GET TOGETHER WITH OTHER AGENCIES AND GET THEM ON BOARD TO ESTABLISH A WIDE REGIONAL AREA. THE PUBLIC SAFETY ANSWERING POINTS WHICH OFFER THIS SERVICE. IF IT WAS REGIONAL LIES TO SOMEONE WHO LIVES IN SAY THE CITY OF ROSEVILLE BUT WORKED IN THE CITY OF GALT. COULD HAVE THEIR PROFILE INFORMATION POP UP IN FRONT OF ANY THERE ARE NINE ONE ONE DISPATCHERS. IN JURISDICTIONS TO WHICH THE CALLER LIVES WORKS OR PASSES THROUGH. THIS TYPE OF REGIONAL NET IS WHAT WE BELIEVE IS NECESSARY FOR A SERVICE LIKE THIS TO THE ULTIMATELY BE SUCCESSFUL. WHILE I WAS NOT WORKING IN THE PUBLIC SAFETY ANSWERING POINTS TO FIELD EMERGENCY CALLS. DURING THE INITIAL EVACUATION OF THE AREAS AFFECTED BY THE CAMPFIRE IN BUTTE COUNTY. I CAN ONLY IMAGINE THAT IF PROFILE INFORMATION POPULATED FOR THOSE NINE ONE ONE DISPATCHERS ANSWERING THE LINES. THERE WOULD'VE BEEN A LOT OF HELPFUL INFORMATION AVAILABLE EVEN WITHOUT THE CALLER SPEAKING. IT IS NEVER AN IDEAL SITUATION FOR CALLERS NOT TO TALK TO NINE ONE ONE DISPATCHER BUT CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE OFFERED AN ADDITIONAL LAYER OF POTENTIAL LIFE SAVING INFORMATION FOR THOSE DISPATCHERS. AS A DISPATCH SUPERVISOR FOR THE OAK GROVE POLICE DEPARTMENT AND AS THE STATE COORDINATOR FOR THE TELE COMMUNICATORS SEE RESPONSE TASK FORCE. WHICH SENT OVER ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY DISPATCHERS FROM AROUND THE STATE FROM THIRTY MUTUAL AID AGENCIES. I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT FOR A BI NINE ELEVEN IS I BELIEVE A STATEWIDE SYSTEM AVAILABLE TO ALL CALLERS WHO CREATE PROFILES WILL ULTIMATELY. MAKE PROVIDING EMERGENCY SERVICES MORE EFFICIENT AND COULD POTENTIALLY ASSISTANCE AND SAVING LIVES. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU. NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS ASTRAZENECA I AM THE EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT OF UNITED DOMESTIC WORKERS ASKED ME LOCAL THIRTY NINE THIRTY WE REPRESENT OVER A HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND HOME CARE PROVIDERS ACROSS THE STATE. WHOSE -- CLIENTS WHO ARE THE ELDERLY AND DISABLED MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY WOULD BENEFIT FROM A PROGRAM SUCH AS THIS. I AM I AM HERE TODAY TO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND I VOTE FOR A. B.. NINE ONE ONE THE MANY ALERT ACT -- AND I'LL GIVE YOU A BRIEF BACKGROUND AS TO WHY. THE MAIN REASON IS MY SON MANNY. I HE IS TWENTY YEARS OLD. HE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH AUTISM AND INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY AT THE AGE OF THREE HI HE IS AT THE MORE SEVERE END OF THE SPECTRUM. WHERE HE HAS NONVERBAL COMBATIVE HE DOESN'T FOLLOW VERBAL COMMANDS? AND HE'S A FLIGHT RISK WITH NO FEAR OF WATER HEIGHTS CARS. I HAD AND HE'S ALSO AN EPILEPTIC. AND WHILE HE LOOKS VERY HANDSOME NORMAL YOUNG MAN ON THE OUTSIDE HE IS VERY CHILD LIKE. HE LOVES THINGS SUCH AS CARTOONS DISNEY MOVIES DOOR THE EXPLORA HE LOVES MUSIC -- NICE BOUNCY HOUSES AS BUT HE DEPENDS ON SOMEONE FOR HIS DAILY LIVING TASKS AS WELL. AND IT WAS ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO WHEN HE MANAGED TO GET OUT OF MY HOUSE ONE OF MY OTHER CHILDREN FORGOT TO LOCK THE GATE. AND I'M SURE YOU CAN IMAGINE AS MOST OF YOU ARE PROBABLY PARENTS. THE FEAR WHEN I REALIZED THAT HE WAS GONE. I LUCKILY FOR ME WE DID FIND IN ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTE WINDOW. WHICH FELT LIKE ETERNITY. HOWEVER WE FOUND ABOUT TWENTY FEET AWAY FROM A BRIDGE DOWN THE ROAD FROM MY HOUSE. SO IN THOSE MOMENTS AFTER GETTING HIM HOME COMING DOWN. HARD SOMEWHAT COMING DOWN. AT MY WILL STARTED SPENDING AND ALL OF MY FEARS AT THAT POINT HAD ALMOST COME TO A REALITY. I STARTED THINKING ABOUT ALL OF THE WHAT IFS WHAT IF HE HAD GOTTEN INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE BRIDGE AND SAW THE WATER BECAUSE HE LOVES TO PLAY IN WATER. HE WOULD HAVE JUMPED. AND WHAT IF HE GOT HIT BY A CAR BECAUSE HE HAS NO FEAR OF THOSE THINGS HE JUST. WALKS RIGHT OUT INTO THE STREET -- ALSO ONE OF A FIRST RESPONDER IN THIS INSTANCE PRIMARILY A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER WOULD HAVE COME INTO CONTACT WITH HIM. AND MISTAKEN HIS CALM NON COMPLIANCE FOR JUST THAT. BUT NOT PART OF HIS DISABILITY. ON IT WAS AT THAT POINT MY WILL STARTED SPENT IN AND I DECIDED I WAS NOT GOING TO SIT BY AND LET MY SON BECOME MANY ONE OF THE MANY STORIES I HAD HEARD OF FROM ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND I HAD. HAD TO TAKE INTO ACTION. WHAT I FELT WAS NECESSARY -- AND KIND OF BRING FORWARD. PUZZLE PIECES SO TO SPEAK OF THIS BIGGER PICTURE OF ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES. SO I STARTED DOING SOME RESEARCH AS TO WHAT WAS AND WASN'T HAPPENING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- I KNEW WE HAD TO HAVE BETTER LET SYSTEMS TRAINING -- TOOLS TO BETTER HELP -- SERVER DISABLE COMMUNITY AND OUR FIRST RESPONDERS. SO I REACHED OUT TO LIKE MINDED LEGISLATORS LIKE ASSEMBLY MEMBER RODRIGUEZ AND MANY OTHERS. TO HELP ME AND FIXING THIS ISSUE. I WILL. AB SO I SPENT MUCH OF THE LAST COUPLE YEARS MEETING WITH -- GROVE -- SANTA CLARITA AND MANY OF THE OTHER -- AGENCIES ACROSS THE STATE THAT ALREADY HAVE THE SIMILAR THINGS IN PLACE. HOWEVER -- WE NEED ONE STATEWIDE COHESIVE PROGRAM -- I'D SPOKEN WITH A POLICE OFFICER TO MANY PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITY THAT I ASKED FOR THIS -- AND THEY WANT IT HI PAT AS OUR CAPTAIN TELL ME THAT WE CANNOT WAIT FOR THIS TO HAPPEN IT HAS TO HAPPEN NOW. AND I JUST. I COULD GO ON FOR DAYS TALKING ABOUT IT AND I CAN SEE YOU GIVING ME THE EYE -- SO -- I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIRMAN SANTIAGO AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR ALLOWING ME TO SHARE JUST A SMALL PORTION OF MY STORY TODAY -- AND AGAIN THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER RODRIGUEZ COMMITMENT TO ME FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS AND HELPING ME GET THIS PAST -- AND I HUMBLY ASK FOR YOUR ALL'S I VOTE THANK YOU.

TO ANY MAIN OPPOSITION WITNESSES. ASSUMING THERE'S NO ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION WITNESSES. I APOLOGIZE I I'M SORRY THAT'S OUR EIGHT BACK A KRAMER MATTER ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA HERE WITH CONCERNS THAT THEY'RE NOT ADEQUATE PRIVACY PROTECTIONS IN THE BILL TO ENSURE THAT THE INFORMATION SUBMITTED. IS ONLY USED FOR THE PURPOSE HIGHLIGHTED IN THE BILL AND NOT USED FOR OTHER PURPOSES AND ALSO THERE'S NOT. WAYS TO ENSURE THAT THE INFORMATION SUBMITTED IS IN FACT VERIFIED AND BY THAT INDIVIDUAL AND SO WE ASK FOR AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS THANK YOU. ANY ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION WITNESSES -- AIR CARRIERS WITH DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIAN WE'D HAVE THE SAME CONCERNS THANK YOU. A QUESTIONS FOR COMMITTEE MEMBERS. YES -- IS CRUCIAL. HI NOT A QUESTION BUT I DO WANNA COMMEND DONE NOT ONLY THE AUTHOR BUT YEAH AMY AND HER STORY ABOUT HER SON AS IT REALLY PAINTS THE PICTURE. UP FOR MANY PARENTS AS THEY SEE THEIR CHILDREN GROW INTO DULTS AND THEY WORK ON THAT BALANCE BETWEEN INDEPENDENCE AND SAFETY. I KNOW THAT -- WE ALSO HAVE A GROWING COMMUNITY OF OCT TWO STICKS TIME -- CHILDREN AND YOUNG ADULTS AND SO THIS MEASURE -- IN THE FUTURE I THINK WOULD BE ABLE TO BE EXPANDED TO APPLY TO MANY OTHERS THAT OUR PARTICULARLY AS THEY GET OLDER THE THE ONE FACT THAT REALLY. HITS HOME IS THE COMPLIANCE AS FAR AS PUBLIC SAFETY WOULD GO AND UNDERSTANDING WHO THEY MAY BE ENCOUNTERING SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. MR OBERNOLTE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF SOMEONE A GREAT BILL THANK YOU FOR BRINGING FORWARD CERTAINLY WILL BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY. A COUPLE CONCERNS I WANTED TO SHARE WITH YOU -- FIRST OF ALL LIKE TO ASK. WHAT'S YOUR FEELING IS ABOUT -- THIS SYSTEM CREATING ADDITIONAL LIABILITY FOR FIRST RESPONDERS BECAUSE ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT'S BEEN RAISED. IS THAT A FAILURE TO UTILIZE INFORMATION IN THE SYSTEM MIGHT CREATE LIABILITY. FOR A FIRST RESPONDER AND I THINK THAT IT WOULD BE A GOOD THING TO HAVE MAYBE SOME SAFE HARBOR IN THE BILL ESPECIALLY DURING A PHASE IN PERIOD. WHEN WE GET THE SYSTEM OPERATIONAL YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT THAT YES I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT YOU KNOW IT IT'S A NEW SYSTEM AS WERE TRANS -- TRENDS. TRENDS GOING INTO THE NEW SYSTEM WITH NEXT GEN NINE ONE ONE THE SMART. NINE ONCE IN ORDER CAN A JOINT IT'S IT'S VERY OPEN AND I'M OPEN TO WORK WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS TO MAKE SURE WE GET THE SYSTEM RIGHT. AND AS I TALKED ABOUT IT -- I DON'T THINK PEOPLE REALIZE. THAT IN A DAY AND AGE NOT TO RESPOND -- FROM MY PREVIOUS EXPERIENCES WORKING ALBERS INDUSTRY THERE MANY TIMES YOU GET THAT NINE ONE ONE HANG UP CALL THE QUESTRADE. TO THE NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM SO YOU DON'T KNOW IF IT'S A MEDICAL AID CALL IT'S A FIRE CALL OR A SAFETY ISSUE WITH PD. BUT WOULDN'T BE BETTER THAT AS REMOVING TO THIS NEXT GENERATION OF MY ONE SYSTEM. THAT WE GET ALL THAT RELEVANT INFORMATION THAT HEY YOU KNOW WHAT. THERE IS SOMEBODY THAT VOLUNTARILY -- PUT THEM SOUTH PUT THEIR INFORMATION ON THE SYSTEM SO WE KNOW. WHAT TYPE OF PERSON WE MAY COME INTO THAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN THAT PERSON? THAT WASN'T ABLE TO TALK BUT WE HAVE THE MY ONE CARD THAT WE ALREADY HAVE ALL THE HELP MEDICAL INFORMATION SO WE CAN BETTER RESPOND. TO PREPARE OURSELVES ONCE WE ARRIVED ON THE SCENE OF THE CALL TO PROVIDE THE BEST TREATMENT ANSWER FOR THOSE -- PERSON THAT ARE EITHER SICK OR INJURED. AND IT'S KIND OF A PLACE IN A ROAD MAP TO HOW WE GET THERE BUT MAKING SURE THAT WE GET IT RIGHT FOR THE RIGHT REASONS YEAH I SOME OPEN. AND IT'S SOME OF THAT INFORMATION THAT'S GOING TO BE THE MOST CRITICAL FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU HAD A A MEDICATION ALLERGY THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU VERY MUCH WANT TO FIRST RESPONDERS TO KNOW ABOUT BUT IF YOU WERE TO PUT THAT IN. TWO VIEWS A RIDICULOUS EXAMPLE THE DAY AFTER THE ROLL OUT OF THE SYSTEM AND TWO DAYS AFTER A PARAMEDIC CAME OUT DIDN'T CHECK THAT IN ITS PRESCRIBE THAT MEDICATION FOR YOU. AND YOU KNOW THAT THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING WHERE THAT MIGHT CREATE -- SOME LIABILITY AND A CAUSE OF ACTION -- FOR AGAINST THAT FIRST RESPOND OR NO MAYBE LONG TERM THAT'S APPROPRIATE BUT BUT I THINK AS WE ROLL OUT WE NEED TO BE SENSITIVE TO THAT. I'D ONE OTHER CONCERN TO SHARE WITH YOU AND AND THIS IS. NOT A CRITICISM BECAUSE I REALIZE THIS IS IN THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS THAT YOU WERE JUST ASKED TO TAKE SO I WAS NEGOTIATION WITH THE COMMITTEE I'M AWARE OF THAT BUT AMONGST THE PIECES OF INFORMATION YOU'RE ADDING TO THE SYSTEM IS RATE THE RACE OR ETHNICITY. AND I KNOW WE'RE ALL AWARE OF THE EFFORTS THAT WE'VE MADE RECENTLY IN THE LEGISLATURE TO TRY AND ROOT OUT RACISM IN. A LAW ENFORCEMENT -- WE CERTAINLY WOULDN'T WANT TO CREATE A NEW SOURCE OF INFORMATION THAT COULD BE USED TO PERPETUATE RACISM. AND I I JUST. WHAT WOULD ACTUALLY BE SENSITIVE TO THAT BECAUSE? THE HOUSE THE BILL MOVES FORWARD I I'M NOT SURE THAT THAT'S INFORMATION THAT WE WANT PEOPLE TO BE AWARE OF BEFORE THEY SHOW UP AT THE EVENT. AND I THINK THAT'S JUST. GIVE THE FIRST RESPONDERS A BETTER IDEA OF THE TYPE OF PERSON THE LOOKING FOR RIGHT AS WE LOOK AT THE RACE AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE I'M NOT ENOUGH OF IT UNDER CENTER INTENSE CRYING I MEAN AND AND I WOULD HATE TO PUT THE ONUS ON THE OTHER BECAUSE WE DID. A SUGGEST THE AMENDMENTS THAT THAT'S WHY AND THE AND THE AUTHORS ACCEPTED THEM -- I WOULD ECHO WHAT THE AUTHOR SAID NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO DARLING WHICH BEARS -- AND TO THE DEGREE THAT WE'RE COLLECTING INFORMATION IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT A FIRST RESPONDER -- SHOWS UP -- A GOOD EXAMPLE MY PARENTS AND AND THEY DON'T HAVE GOOD GOOD -- A GOOD GRASP OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE THAT THAT THE PERSON WOULD HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN WE'RE SPEAKING TO THIS PERSON THAT ARE WALKING AND IF THE IF THERE ISN'T A RESPONSE TO THE WRIST THE LACK OF RESPONSE MIGHT IMMEDIATELY BE. THE FACT THAT THERE MAY BE A LANGUAGE BARRIER AS OPPOSED AND THAT WHICH IS VERY CERTAINLY I COULD SEE FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE -- WHAT WHAT YOU MIGHT HAVE SEEN THAT IN THE AMENDMENTS THAT THAT WAS NOT THE INTENT THE INTENT WAS SOMETHING ELSE OKAY WELL? THEN PERHAPS WE SHOULD RENAME THAT LANGUAGE -- BUT WHAT WHAT I'M TRYING TO AVOID IS I MEAN GOD FOR BID WE HAVE ANY. FIRST RESPONDERS THAT WOULD LOOK AT SOMEONE'S RACE AND BE LESS LIKELY TO RESPOND TO PROVIDE ACCURATE SERVICE I HOPE THAT THERE'S NO ONE IN CALIFORNIA THAT COULD BE TRUE UP -- IF THERE IS THOUGH I WOULD HATE TO ENABLE THEM BY MAKING THAT INFORMATION AVAILABLE WE WOULD BOTH BE ON THE SAME SIDE IS CERTAINLY WE WOULD TAKE A LOOK AT BUT THAT BUT THAT THE INTENT THAT -- THE AUTHOR ECHOED IN ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS IN THE INTENT THAT I SUGGESTED -- WERE THE LINES THAT WE ARE VIEWING THIS ENTERING THIS OKAY WELL I JUST WANTED TO SHARE THAT CONCERN WITH YOU BUT ASSEMBLYMAN AS AS A GREAT BILL AND WHICH YOU ARE. THE BEST OF LUCK IN APPROPRIATIONS GET THAT THROUGH BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS A SYSTEM THAT CALIFORNIA NEEDS THANK YOU. ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS.
