00:31:42.433 --> 00:31:43.134

VARIES BUT A COMMON.

00:31:48.006 --> 00:31:49.173
CAUSE STRUCTURE OF CROSS PUBLIC

BENEFITS AND RETIREMENT BENEFITS

00:31:54.812 --> 00:31:55.847
AND A KEY DISTINCTION BETWEEN

00:31:55.913 --> 00:31:57.348
THESE BENEFITS IS THAT SALARY

00:31:57.415 --> 00:31:59.717

UP IT'S NOT RECEIVED UNTIL SOME

00:32:07.558 --> 00:32:11.562
FUTURE DATE AFTER THEY RETIRE --

00:32:11.629 --> 00:32:12.864
AND WITHIN THE BUCKET OF

00:32:12.930 --> 00:32:14.032
RETIREMENT BENEFITS PENSIONS ARE

00:32:14.098 --> 00:32:15.633
WHAT WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT

00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:16.567
MOSTLY TODAY.

00:32:16.634 --> 00:32:18.036
BUT THERE ARE ALSO RETIREE

00:32:18.102 --> 00:32:19.937
HEALTH CARE BENEFITS.

00:32:20.004 --> 00:32:21.339
THAT -- MANY --

00:32:21.406 --> 00:32:22.440
PUBLIC EMPLOYEES ACROSS THE

00:32:22.507 --> 00:32:23.841
STATE RECEIVE --

00:32:23.908 --> 00:32:24.742
AND ONE THING I WANTED TO

00:32:24.809 --> 00:32:27.078
MENTION ON IN TERMS OF PENN.

00:32:27.145 --> 00:32:29.480
IT HAS A DIFFERENT --

00:32:29.547 --> 00:32:30.948
ALTHOUGH IT'S IMPORTANT BENEFITS

00:32:31.015 --> 00:32:32.250
FOR ALL EMPLOYEES IT HAS THAT

00:32:32.317 --> 00:32:33.851
KIND MORE IMPORTANCE FOR UP

00:32:33.918 --> 00:32:34.919
CERTAIN GROUPS OF EMPLOYEES AND

00:32:34.986 --> 00:32:36.487
IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR.

00:32:36.554 --> 00:32:38.323
NAMELY TEACHERS AND POLICE

00:32:38.389 --> 00:32:40.091
OFFICERS AND FIREFIGHTERS WHO

00:32:40.158 --> 00:32:41.926
ARE NOT ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE

00:32:41.993 --> 00:32:43.394
IN SOCIAL SECURITY --

00:32:43.461 --> 00:32:45.096
WHERE AS MANY MISCELLANEOUS

00:32:45.163 --> 00:32:46.397
PUBLIC EMPLOYEES ARE TO

00:32:46.464 --> 00:32:47.665
PARTICIPATE IN SOCIAL SECURITY

00:32:47.732 --> 00:32:48.800
ANNA PENSION BENEFITS WHEN THEY

00:32:48.866 --> 00:32:50.968
RETIRE THEY HAVE? TO GUARANTEED

00:32:51.035 --> 00:32:52.937
INCOME STREAMS AND RETIREMENT --

00:32:53.004 --> 00:32:55.173
TEACHERS IN PEACE OFFICERS --

00:32:55.239 --> 00:32:56.841
REALLY RELY ON THE PENSION AS

00:32:56.908 --> 00:32:59.344
THEIR PRIMARY INCOME SOURCE IN

00:32:59.410 --> 00:33:00.745
RETIREMENT.

00:33:00.812 --> 00:33:01.479
AND THE OTHER THING I WANT TO

00:33:01.546 --> 00:33:02.113
TALK ABOUT IN TERMS OF THE ROLE

00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:03.281
OF PUBLIC --

00:33:03.348 --> 00:33:04.615
OF RETIREMENT AND COMPENSATION

00:33:04.682 --> 00:33:06.284
IS JUST PEPPER IT'S THE PUBLIC

00:33:06.351 --> 00:33:09.320
EMPLOYEES PENSION REFORM ACT OF

00:33:09.387 --> 00:33:09.821
TWENTY THIRTEEN AND IT'S

00:33:09.887 --> 00:33:10.855
IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO KNOW JUST

00:33:10.922 --> 00:33:11.823
BECAUSE IT.

00:33:11.889 --> 00:33:13.991
IT REDUCED BENEFITS GOING

00:33:14.058 --> 00:33:15.493
FORWARD FOR FUTURE EMPLOYEES AND

00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:17.829
ALSO CREATED A STANDARD WHERE BY

00:33:17.895 --> 00:33:19.364
EMPLOYEES WILL CONTRIBUTE HALF

00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:21.099
OF WHAT'S CALLED THE NORMAL COST --

00:33:21.165 --> 00:33:22.166
AND THE NORMAL COST IS

00:33:22.233 --> 00:33:23.468
ESSENTIALLY THE AMOUNT OF MONEY

00:33:23.534 --> 00:33:24.836
THE ACTUARIES DETERMINE MUST BE

00:33:24.902 --> 00:33:26.537
SET ASIDE EACH YEAR TO PRE FUND

00:33:26.604 --> 00:33:28.072
THE BENEFIT OVER THE COURSE OF

00:33:28.139 --> 00:33:29.607
THE EMPLOYEES CAREER SO THAT.

00:33:29.674 --> 00:33:31.809
THE MONEY IS AVAILABLE AT THE

00:33:31.876 --> 00:33:32.377
END OF THEIR CAREER FOR IN

00:33:32.443 --> 00:33:33.978
RETIREMENT --

00:33:34.045 --> 00:33:34.579
TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE'S AN

00:33:34.645 --> 00:33:37.215
UNFUNDED LIABILITIES TURNS FOR

00:33:37.281 --> 00:33:38.182
LESS THAN ACTUAR IS ASSUMED WHEN

00:33:38.249 --> 00:33:40.017
THEY DEVELOP THE NORMAL COST --

00:33:40.084 --> 00:33:41.352
THE UNFUNDED LIABILITIES

00:33:41.419 --> 00:33:43.221
RESPONSIBILITY OF THE EMPLOYER

00:33:43.287 --> 00:33:44.722
AND THAT WOULD BE WHY.

00:33:44.789 --> 00:33:46.290
THE THERE'S A LITTLE DISPARITY

00:33:46.357 --> 00:33:47.091
IN BETWEEN --

00:33:47.158 --> 00:33:48.393
IN TERMS OF THE AMOUNT THAT

00:33:48.459 --> 00:33:50.027
EMPLOYEES CONTRIBUTE VERSES THE

00:33:50.094 --> 00:33:50.495
SIZE OF THE EMPLOYER

00:33:50.561 --> 00:33:52.230
CONTRIBUTIONS BECAUSE EMPLOYERS

00:33:52.296 --> 00:33:53.264
ALSO.

00:33:53.331 --> 00:33:55.633
PAYING DOWN THE ON FROM

00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:57.101
LIABILITY IF THERE IS.

00:33:57.168 --> 00:33:58.336
ONE THAT'S UP TURNING TO THE LAY

00:33:58.403 --> 00:33:58.903
OF THE LAND OF THE PENSION

00:33:58.970 --> 00:34:00.071
SYSTEMS --

00:34:00.138 --> 00:34:01.572
EACH PENSION SYSTEM IS DIFFERENT

00:34:01.639 --> 00:34:02.940
AND THAT THEY OFFER DIFFERENT

00:34:03.007 --> 00:34:04.542
BENEFITS THEY SERVE DIFFERENT

00:34:04.609 --> 00:34:05.510
LAWYERS THEY SERVE DIFFERENT

00:34:05.576 --> 00:34:07.178
TYPES OF EMPLOYEES --

00:34:07.245 --> 00:34:09.046
BUT THERE ARE SOME COMMON THINGS

00:34:09.113 --> 00:34:10.748
ACROSS ALL THE SYSTEMS ONE IS

00:34:10.815 --> 00:34:11.983
THAT THEY'RE ADMINISTERED BY

00:34:12.049 --> 00:34:13.317
PENSION BOARD.

00:34:13.384 --> 00:34:15.052
AND THE PENSION BOARD HAS

00:34:15.119 --> 00:34:16.354
PLENARY AUTHORITY AS WELL AS FOR

00:34:16.421 --> 00:34:18.022
TO SHARE RESPONSIBILITY TO THE

00:34:18.089 --> 00:34:20.158
MEMBERS OF THE SYSTEM --

00:34:20.224 --> 00:34:21.426
TO ENSURE THAT THIS BENEFIT

00:34:21.492 --> 00:34:23.494
EXISTS ONCE THEY THEY DO RETIRE

00:34:23.561 --> 00:34:24.662
AND AND SO THE DIFFERENCE

00:34:24.729 --> 00:34:25.930
BETWEEN THE EMPLOYER AND THE

00:34:25.997 --> 00:34:27.398
BOARD IS REALLY THAT THE

00:34:27.465 --> 00:34:28.232
EMPLOYER.

00:34:28.299 --> 00:34:29.400
AND THE ALSO THE EMPLOYEE TO

00:34:29.467 --> 00:34:30.868
THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS PUTS THE

00:34:30.935 --> 00:34:33.504
MONEY INTO THE PENSION TRUST AND

00:34:33.571 --> 00:34:35.339
IT'S UP TO THE BOARD TO THEN

00:34:35.406 --> 00:34:36.140
DETERMINE HOW TO INVEST THE

00:34:36.207 --> 00:34:37.275
FUNDS --

00:34:37.341 --> 00:34:38.776
WHAT ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS USED

00:34:38.843 --> 00:34:40.344
TO DETERMINE WHAT CONTRIBUTIONS

00:34:40.411 --> 00:34:42.046
ARE NECESSARY AND REALLY TO IT

00:34:42.113 --> 00:34:43.114
JUST ADMINISTER THE BENEFIT

00:34:43.181 --> 00:34:45.082
GOING FOR BUT THE PENSION?

00:34:45.149 --> 00:34:47.018
SYSTEM ITSELF DOES NOT PAY FOR

00:34:47.084 --> 00:34:50.855
THE HE'S CONTRIBUTIONS.

00:34:50.922 --> 00:34:51.856
AND SO THERE'S REALLY TWO

00:34:51.923 --> 00:34:53.057
DIFFERENT TYPES OF PENSION

00:34:53.124 --> 00:34:54.325
SYSTEMS IN CALIFORNIA THERE'S A

00:34:54.392 --> 00:34:56.294
STATE WIDE SYSTEMS AND THERE'S

00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:57.662
THE LOCALLY ADMINISTERED SYSTEMS.

00:34:57.728 --> 00:34:59.630
FROZE FOR THE STATEWIDE SYSTEMS

00:34:59.697 --> 00:35:01.365
THERE'S CALPERS AND CAL STIRS --

00:35:01.432 --> 00:35:03.000
AND ALSO YOU SEE OUR P. WHICH IS

00:35:03.067 --> 00:35:04.602
OUR P. IS AVAILABLE TO

00:35:04.669 --> 00:35:05.937
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA PLEASE

00:35:06.003 --> 00:35:07.672
AND IS ADMINISTERED BY THE BOARD

00:35:07.738 --> 00:35:08.539
OF REGENTS.

00:35:08.606 --> 00:35:10.408
ALSO FOR THIS PURPOSE FOR TALK

00:35:10.475 --> 00:35:11.709
MOSTLY ABOUT CALPERS AND CAL

00:35:11.776 --> 00:35:12.910
STIRS BECAUSE WHAT THE

00:35:12.977 --> 00:35:14.545
LEGISLATURE HAS THE MOST OF THE

00:35:14.612 --> 00:35:16.514
WORK DIRECT AUTHORITY OVER --

00:35:16.581 --> 00:35:17.815
CALPERS IS --

00:35:17.882 --> 00:35:19.484
PROVIDES BENEFITS TO LOCAL

00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:21.419
GOVERNMENTS AS WELL AS TO STATE

00:35:21.486 --> 00:35:23.421
GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES AND FOR THE

00:35:23.488 --> 00:35:24.222
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AS THOSE LOCAL

00:35:24.288 --> 00:35:25.189
GOVERNMENTS WHO CHOOSE TO

00:35:25.256 --> 00:35:26.891
CONTRACT WITH CALPERS TO PROVIDE

00:35:26.958 --> 00:35:28.392
PENSION BENEFITS --

00:35:28.459 --> 00:35:29.727
IN ADDITION CALPERS ALSO

00:35:29.794 --> 00:35:31.329
ADMINISTERS PENSION BENEFITS FOR

00:35:31.395 --> 00:35:32.597
SCHOOL DISTRICT EMPLOYEES WERE

00:35:32.663 --> 00:35:34.432
NOT TEACHERS SO CAFETERIA

00:35:34.499 --> 00:35:38.202
WORKERS CUSTODIAL STAFF THOSE

00:35:38.269 --> 00:35:41.472
TYPES OF CLASSIFICATIONS --

00:35:41.539 --> 00:35:42.039
IN ADDITION TO THE PENSION

00:35:42.106 --> 00:35:43.307
BENEFITS CALPERS ALSO

00:35:43.374 --> 00:35:44.709
ADMINISTERS HEALTH BENEFITS FOR

00:35:44.775 --> 00:35:45.776
STATE EMPLOYEES AND STATE

00:35:45.843 --> 00:35:46.978
RETIREES.

00:35:47.044 --> 00:35:49.046
AND ALSO FOR ANY EMPLOYEES

00:35:49.113 --> 00:35:50.781
RETIREES OF PARTICIPATING LOCAL

00:35:50.848 --> 00:35:52.383
GOVERNMENTS.

00:35:52.450 --> 00:35:53.885
AND SO UNDER FOR CAL STIRS THEY

00:35:53.951 --> 00:35:54.552
PROVIDE PENSION BENEFIT A

00:35:54.619 --> 00:35:56.020
MINISTER THE PENSION BENEFITS

00:35:56.087 --> 00:35:57.321
FOR TEACHERS --

00:35:57.388 --> 00:35:58.189
AND THE ONE THING I WANT TO

00:35:58.256 --> 00:35:59.891
HIGHLIGHT ABOUT CAL STIRS THE

00:35:59.957 --> 00:36:01.259
TWENTY FOURTEEN FUNDING PLAN.

00:36:01.325 --> 00:36:03.594
WHERE THE LEGISLATURE ADOPTED A

00:36:03.661 --> 00:36:04.996
FUNDING PLAN WERE BY?

00:36:05.062 --> 00:36:07.131
TEACHERS AS WELL AS THE SCHOOL

00:36:07.198 --> 00:36:08.900
DISTRICT AND THE STATE ALL BE

00:36:08.966 --> 00:36:10.735
CONTRIBUTE MORE MONEY INTO THE

00:36:10.801 --> 00:36:11.769
CAL STIR SYSTEM.

00:36:11.836 --> 00:36:13.037
SO THAT --

00:36:13.104 --> 00:36:14.605
THE PENSION SYSTEM WILL BE FULLY

00:36:14.672 --> 00:36:16.741
FUNDED BY TWENTY FORTY SIX

00:36:16.807 --> 00:36:18.676
THAT'S THE TARGET DATE. FIVE

00:36:18.743 --> 00:36:21.846
WHICH WILL BE FULLY FUNDED.

00:36:21.913 --> 00:36:22.446
OKAY THEN THERE'S THIS OTHER

00:36:22.513 --> 00:36:23.614
POCKET OF OF SYSTEMS THAT ARE

00:36:23.681 --> 00:36:24.916
LOCALLY ADMINISTERED AND AS THE

00:36:24.982 --> 00:36:27.084
CHAIR INDICATORS THE NINETEEN

00:36:27.151 --> 00:36:27.652
THIRTY SEVEN ACCIDENTS WHICH

00:36:27.718 --> 00:36:29.887
THOSE ARE THERE'S TWENTY SYSTEMS

00:36:29.954 --> 00:36:31.088
THERE AND RUN BY COUNTIES UNDER

00:36:31.155 --> 00:36:32.023
THAT LAW.

00:36:32.089 --> 00:36:33.791
AND IT'S THE COUNTY EMPLOYEES

00:36:33.858 --> 00:36:35.526
RETIREMENT LAW OF NINETEEN

00:36:35.593 --> 00:36:36.127
THIRTY SEVEN BUT WE REFER TO

00:36:36.193 --> 00:36:37.528
THEM AS THE THREE SAT SEVEN X.

00:36:37.595 --> 00:36:38.429
SYSTEMS.

00:36:38.496 --> 00:36:39.797
IN ADDITION OF THE COUNTY SAN

00:36:39.864 --> 00:36:42.466
LUIS OBISPO ALL ITS OWN

00:36:42.533 --> 00:36:43.968
INDEPENDENT SYSTEM BUT THAT'S

00:36:44.035 --> 00:36:45.269
ESTABLISHED UNDER ANOTHER

00:36:45.336 --> 00:36:46.604
SECTION OF LAW.

00:36:46.671 --> 00:36:48.406
CHARTER CITIES ALSO ADMINISTER

00:36:48.472 --> 00:36:50.775
OR CANISTER THEIR OWN SYSTEM SO

00:36:50.841 --> 00:36:52.843
FRESNO SAN DIEGO A LOS ANGELES

00:36:52.910 --> 00:36:54.345
ALL MINISTER THEIR OWN --

00:36:54.412 --> 00:36:56.047
SYSTEM OTHER THAN THAT THE

00:36:56.113 --> 00:36:57.582
COUNTIES AND CITIES AND OTHER

00:36:57.648 --> 00:36:58.282
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS A SPECIAL

00:36:58.349 --> 00:36:59.850
DISTRICTS CAN CHOOSE CONTRACT

00:36:59.917 --> 00:37:01.285
WITH EITHER THE COUNTY SYSTEMS

00:37:01.352 --> 00:37:02.153
OR WITH.

00:37:02.219 --> 00:37:04.155
CALPERS TO ADMINISTER THE

00:37:04.221 --> 00:37:06.757
BENEFITS FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES.

00:37:06.824 --> 00:37:08.893
OKAY SO NOW LOOKING AT THE

00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:10.394
STATE'S KIND OF PERSPECTIVE OF

00:37:10.461 --> 00:37:11.762
OF PAYING FOR THIS BENEFIT --

00:37:11.829 --> 00:37:13.497
THAT OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS OR

00:37:13.564 --> 00:37:15.032
SO THE COSTS OF REALLY.

00:37:15.099 --> 00:37:16.233
GROWN SIGNIFICANTLY IN THIS IS

00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:17.702
SOMETHING THAT ALL EMPLOYERS

00:37:17.768 --> 00:37:19.937
HAVE EXPERIENCED --

00:37:20.004 --> 00:37:22.807
AND JUST TO ILLUSTRATE THIS --

00:37:22.873 --> 00:37:24.375
IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN SO IN THE

00:37:24.442 --> 00:37:27.178
CURRENT BUDGET YEAR THE STATE'S --

00:37:27.244 --> 00:37:28.312
CONTRIBUTION AS A PERCENTAGE OF

00:37:28.379 --> 00:37:31.849
PAY RANGES BETWEEN 19% AND 54% A

00:37:31.916 --> 00:37:32.883
CALPERS --

00:37:32.950 --> 00:37:34.151
AND THE STATE'S FIVE PENSION

00:37:34.218 --> 00:37:35.753
PLANS IN CALPERS AND A

00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:37.088
CONTRIBUTION AMOUNT VARIES

00:37:37.154 --> 00:37:39.156
DEPENDING ON THE GENEROSITY THE

00:37:39.223 --> 00:37:41.158
BENEFIT WHICH IS DETERMINED BY.

00:37:41.225 --> 00:37:43.427
THE EMPLOYEE TYPES OR THE PEACE

00:37:43.494 --> 00:37:44.495
OFFICERS WAS IS THEIR ONLY FORM

00:37:44.562 --> 00:37:49.200
OF INCOME IN RETIREMENT ETCETERA

00:37:49.266 --> 00:37:51.969
AND TO THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN

00:37:52.036 --> 00:37:53.337
RATES AND EIGHT OR NINE OTHER

00:37:53.404 --> 00:37:56.774
RATES RANGE FROM 16% 232% OF THE

00:37:56.841 --> 00:37:57.742
COUNTRY'S RATES OF REALLY GONE

00:37:57.808 --> 00:37:59.810
UP QUITE A BIT OVER THE PAST TEN

00:37:59.877 --> 00:38:00.544
YEARS.

00:38:00.611 --> 00:38:01.579
JUST AS ONE EXAMPLE THE

00:38:01.646 --> 00:38:02.913
MISCELLANEOUS PLAN WHICH IS THE

00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:05.816
STATE'S LARGEST PLAN WAS --

00:38:05.883 --> 00:38:07.885
BY SIXTEEN POINT 6% IN --

00:38:07.952 --> 00:38:10.121
EIGHT OR NINE AND IT'S NOW 29%

00:38:10.187 --> 00:38:12.890
OF PAY SO IT'S GONE QUITE A BIT

00:38:12.957 --> 00:38:14.191
AND THE MEAT THERE REALLY TO

00:38:14.258 --> 00:38:15.926
DRIVING FACTORS BEHIND THIS ONE

00:38:15.993 --> 00:38:17.094
ARE ARE THE INVESTMENT LOSSES

00:38:17.161 --> 00:38:18.396
MOST NOTABLY BECAUSE OF THE

00:38:18.462 --> 00:38:20.097
GREAT RECESSION --

00:38:20.164 --> 00:38:21.298
I MEAN I'VE I PULLED AWAY --

00:38:21.365 --> 00:38:22.299
TO NINE NUMBERS FOR REASON IS

00:38:22.366 --> 00:38:23.768
KINDA ILLUSTRATING JUST BEFORE

00:38:23.834 --> 00:38:26.637
WE HAD THE LARGE INVESTMENT

00:38:26.704 --> 00:38:29.006
LOSSES --

00:38:29.073 --> 00:38:31.108
AND THEN ALSO THERE SINCE THE

00:38:31.175 --> 00:38:31.876
GREAT RECESSION HAVE ALSO BEEN

00:38:31.942 --> 00:38:32.943
SOME PERIODS WHERE THERE HAVE

00:38:33.010 --> 00:38:33.711
BEEN LOWER THAN ASSUME

00:38:33.778 --> 00:38:35.246
INVESTMENT RETURNS AND SO THOSE

00:38:35.312 --> 00:38:36.514
OF ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO IT.

00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:39.116
BUT ALSO NOTABLE IS THAT THE

00:38:39.183 --> 00:38:40.551
CALPERS BOARD IS ADOPTED NEW

00:38:40.618 --> 00:38:42.286
ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS.

00:38:42.353 --> 00:38:43.421
ARE THAT REALLY ARE INTENDED TO

00:38:43.487 --> 00:38:45.389
PUT THE SYSTEM ON A BETTER

00:38:45.456 --> 00:38:46.824
FOOTING FOR MORE SUSTAINABLE

00:38:46.891 --> 00:38:48.592
BENEFIT GOING FORWARD AND THESE

00:38:48.659 --> 00:38:49.460
THESE ACT WORLD SECTIONS OF

00:38:49.527 --> 00:38:50.361
INCLUDED.

00:38:50.428 --> 00:38:52.229
ASSUMING THAT --

00:38:52.296 --> 00:38:52.863
MEMBERS LIVE LONGER BECAUSE THEY

00:38:52.930 --> 00:38:56.434
REAL ASSUMING AND ALSO MOST

00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:58.469
IMPORTANTLY IS THE LOWERING OF

00:38:58.536 --> 00:38:59.537
THE DISCOUNT RATES IN OTHER

00:38:59.603 --> 00:39:01.305
WORDS THEY'RE ASSUMING THAT. FOR

00:39:01.372 --> 00:39:02.973
LESS MONEY WILL BE COMING IN FOR

00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:04.809
THEIR INVESTMENT GAINS IN THE

00:39:04.875 --> 00:39:05.409
FUTURE WHICH MEANS MORE MONEY

00:39:05.476 --> 00:39:06.744
HAS TO COME IN.

00:39:06.811 --> 00:39:08.145
THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS --

00:39:08.212 --> 00:39:09.447
AND THAT'S ALL I HAVE PREPARED

00:39:09.513 --> 00:39:10.514
IF I'LL BE HAPPY TO TAKE AND

00:39:10.581 --> 00:39:11.949
VERY NICE THANK YOU VERY MUCH

00:39:12.016 --> 00:39:14.118
FOR SURE QUESTIONS.

00:39:14.185 --> 00:39:16.253
WELCOME YES HOMELESSNESS AND MY

00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:17.788
NUMBER DOWN THANK YOU I HAVE A

00:39:17.855 --> 00:39:19.390
COUPLE QUESTIONS IN A MAYBE YOU

00:39:19.457 --> 00:39:20.491
ARE THE INDIVIDUAL HANSON MAYBE

00:39:20.558 --> 00:39:21.025
YOU'RE NOT --

00:39:21.092 --> 00:39:22.226
WITH REGARD TO A DEFINED

00:39:22.293 --> 00:39:23.828
CONTRIBUTION --

00:39:23.894 --> 00:39:25.229
THAT'S TYPICALLY ON A FOUR

00:39:25.296 --> 00:39:25.830
THIRTY SEVEN RIGHT MEGACITIES

00:39:25.896 --> 00:39:26.664
OPTED OUT OVER THE PAST SEVERAL

00:39:26.731 --> 00:39:27.765
YEARS.

00:39:27.832 --> 00:39:30.234
TO INTO IT OPTED OUT OF OF PURSE

00:39:30.301 --> 00:39:31.802
OR WHATEVER MAYBE YOU EVEN

00:39:31.869 --> 00:39:36.807
MODIFIED THEIR OWN SYSTEM X.

00:39:36.874 --> 00:39:38.576
INDIA IS AN EXAMPLE OF THAT.

00:39:38.642 --> 00:39:39.877
WHAT WOULD THAT CITY IF THEY DO

00:39:39.944 --> 00:39:41.479
NOT HAVE AN UNDEFINED ATTENTION

00:39:41.545 --> 00:39:42.880
WHICH AND THEY HAD A DEFINED

00:39:42.947 --> 00:39:43.748
PENSION WITH THEY HAVE?

00:39:43.814 --> 00:39:45.950
TO PAY SOCIAL SECURITY.

00:39:46.016 --> 00:39:49.019
I'M I'M NOT SURE THAT I THINK

00:39:49.086 --> 00:39:49.620
WOULD HAVE TO TALK WITH A TAX

00:39:49.687 --> 00:39:50.421
ATTORNEY HOME.

00:39:50.488 --> 00:39:51.989
ANOTHER BECAUSE I I GUESS THE

00:39:52.056 --> 00:39:53.157
QUESTION IS IS IT A FINE PLAN A

00:39:53.224 --> 00:39:54.892
PENSION.

RIGHT BECAUSE YOU CAN YOU CAN

00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:57.828
OPT OUT OF SOCIAL SECURITY HER

00:39:57.895 --> 00:39:58.963
PUBLIC AGENCY OR COULD HAVE AT

00:39:59.029 --> 00:40:00.664
SOME POINT I BELIEVE.

00:40:00.731 --> 00:40:02.767
IF IF YOU IF YOU IF YOU HAVE A

00:40:02.833 --> 00:40:04.969
PUBLIC PENSION RIGHT.

00:40:05.035 --> 00:40:06.937
I'M DEEMED YOU KNOW THE ANSWER

00:40:07.004 --> 00:40:08.038
THAT I DON'T KNOW THE OKAY

00:40:08.105 --> 00:40:09.440
THAT'S OUR THAT'S UNDERSTOOD --

00:40:09.507 --> 00:40:11.008
AND WITH REGARD UP TO PERSON

00:40:11.075 --> 00:40:12.476
STIRS WHAT IS I GUESS WHO IS AT

00:40:12.543 --> 00:40:13.711
THE DISCOUNT RATE THE RATE OF

00:40:13.778 --> 00:40:15.613
RETURN WHAT IS IT WHAT IS IT FOR

00:40:15.679 --> 00:40:16.747
OUR THE SYSTEM SIMILAR.

00:40:16.814 --> 00:40:18.482
WE HAD A NUMBER OF BOTH GOING

00:40:18.549 --> 00:40:21.018
DOWN 27% AND THAT'S ABOUT GOING

00:40:21.085 --> 00:40:21.652
AND THEY REALLY SHOULD BE A WHAT

00:40:21.719 --> 00:40:24.054
[inaudible] FIVE WHY THERE'S A

00:40:24.121 --> 00:40:27.525
LOT OF A LOT OF DE THAT DECLARES

00:40:27.591 --> 00:40:28.159
Là CONVERSATION ABOUT WHT THE

00:40:28.225 --> 00:40:29.460
RATE SHOULD BE IF YOU LOOK AT

00:40:29.527 --> 00:40:31.495
THEIR HISTORICAL RETURNS FOR THE

00:40:31.562 --> 00:40:32.897
PAST THIRTY YEARS FOR CALPERS.

00:40:32.963 --> 00:40:34.131
THE RETURNS OF ACTUALLY BEEN

00:40:34.198 --> 00:40:36.934
OVER 8% ON BUT THE FUTURE

00:40:37.001 --> 00:40:37.768
DOESN'T NECESSARILY LIKE THE

00:40:37.835 --> 00:40:38.536
PAST.

00:40:38.602 --> 00:40:39.603
AND SO THERE'S A LOT OF

00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:41.739
SPECULATION AS FAR AS WHAT THAT

00:40:41.806 --> 00:40:42.273
ASSUMPTION SHOULD BE GOING

00:40:42.339 --> 00:40:43.040
FORWARD WITH THE MORE

00:40:43.107 --> 00:40:45.509
CONSERVATIVE FOUR OR MORE OR

00:40:45.576 --> 00:40:46.410
MORE.

00:40:46.477 --> 00:40:47.878
RISKY SO THAT THAT THE TO

00:40:47.945 --> 00:40:51.949
INDIVIDUAL BOARDS ACTUALLY SET

00:40:52.016 --> 00:40:53.284
THE DISCOUNT RATE AT LEAST OFF

00:40:53.350 --> 00:40:54.852

00:48:22.966 --> 00:48:23.934
THERE'S A TABLE AT THE BOTTOM

00:48:24.001 --> 00:48:25.469

ELEVEN TO THIRTEEN THEN

00:48:42.319 --> 00:48:43.453

FIRST PAGE.

00:48:50.894 --> 00:48:51.928
BUT THE MAIN THING TO REMEMBER

00:48:51.995 --> 00:48:53.530
IS THAT WHEN IT COMES TO FINDING

00:48:53.597 --> 00:48:55.399
A PENSION PLAN INVESTMENT RETURN

TO GO UP.

00:49:04.975 --> 00:49:06.276

AS THE LORD A CONTRIBUTION RATE

00:49:14.451 --> 00:49:16.019
IT'S LIKE GETTING A FIFTEEN

00:49:17.688 --> 00:49:18.855
THIS CONCLUDES MY TESTIMONY I

00:49:18.922 --> 00:49:19.923
WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY

00:49:19.990 --> 00:49:20.724
QUESTION.

00:49:20.791 --> 00:49:21.925
AND JUST TO START WITH YOUR

00:49:21.992 --> 00:49:23.226
QUESTION YOU HAD EARLIER MISTER

00:49:23.293 --> 00:49:24.328

BE IN SOCIAL SECURITY BECAUSE

00:49:29.399 --> 00:49:31.835
NOT ALL EMPLOYEES CAN BE.

00:49:31.902 --> 00:49:34.237
AS LONG AS THE FOUR ONE K. PLAN

00:49:34.304 --> 00:49:35.806

00:49:44.081 --> 00:49:45.916
2% OF THE EMPLOYEES OUT OF REACH

00:49:45.982 --> 00:49:47.451
WOULD NOT BE HIGH ENOUGH THE

00:49:47.517 --> 00:49:49.186
IRIS HAS RULES AS TO IF YOU

00:49:49.252 --> 00:49:49.953
DON'T WANT TO PROVIDE SOCIAL

00:49:50.020 --> 00:49:50.687
SECURITY.

00:49:50.754 --> 00:49:52.089
YOU HAVE TO AT LEAST PROVIDE A

00:49:52.155 --> 00:49:54.224
MINIMUM BENEFIT AT THE IRIS HAS

00:49:54.291 --> 00:49:55.559
RULES AS I DON'T HAVE THEM IN

00:49:55.625 --> 00:49:57.461
FRONT OF ME BUT IT IS POSSIBLE

00:49:57.527 --> 00:50:00.530
AS LONG AS YOU MEET THE MINIMUM

00:50:00.597 --> 00:50:01.832
RULES SET BY THE IRS

00:50:01.898 --> 00:50:02.132
[inaudible]

00:50:02.199 --> 00:50:04.501
THANK YOU.

00:50:04.568 --> 00:50:06.203
THANK YOU OTHER QUESTIONS FOR

00:50:06.269 --> 00:50:08.538
ANYONE.

00:50:08.605 --> 00:50:09.873
UP I I HAVE WHEN YOU KNOW HOW

00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:10.707
HOW DO YOU DETERMINE WHETHER OR

00:50:10.774 --> 00:50:12.476
FUNDS ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS ARE

00:50:12.542 --> 00:50:13.944
ACCURATE OR CORRECT OR

00:50:14.010 --> 00:50:14.511
REASONABLE.

00:50:14.578 --> 00:50:15.679
AND HOW HOW DOES THAT WORK IN

00:50:15.746 --> 00:50:17.280
THE LENGTH OF TIME THAT THE

00:50:17.347 --> 00:50:18.815
AMORTIZATION PERIOD.

00:50:18.882 --> 00:50:20.884
GOES IN THE DETERMINATION OF

00:50:20.951 --> 00:50:22.586
THAT I KNOW WITH STIRS WE SET A

00:50:22.652 --> 00:50:23.687
CERTAIN DATE.

00:50:23.754 --> 00:50:25.422
ARBITRARILY I THINK A COUPLE OF

00:50:25.489 --> 00:50:27.724
YEARS AGO --

00:50:27.791 --> 00:50:30.394
IN WHICH THE THE BASIS OF THAT

00:50:30.460 --> 00:50:32.162
SO OF ALLEN AT THE GALA APPROACH

00:50:32.229 --> 00:50:33.096
YOUR QUESTION TWO DIFFERENT WAYS

00:50:33.163 --> 00:50:34.398
WITH RESPECT TO THE ACTUAL

00:50:34.464 --> 00:50:35.699
ASSUMPTION FOR EXAMPLE THE

00:50:35.766 --> 00:50:36.867
INVESTMENT RETURN.

00:50:36.933 --> 00:50:38.735
ALONG MEMBERS ARE EXPECTED TO

00:50:38.802 --> 00:50:39.369
LIVE.

00:50:39.436 --> 00:50:40.937
MOST RETIREMENT SYSTEMS IN

00:50:41.004 --> 00:50:43.140
CALIFORNIA PERFORM WHAT'S CALLED

00:50:43.206 --> 00:50:44.541
AN EXPERIENCED ADD YOUR REVIEW

00:50:44.608 --> 00:50:45.976
OF THE ASSUMPTIONS EVERY FOUR

00:50:46.042 --> 00:50:47.944
YEARS MORE WERE YOU LOOK AT THE

00:50:48.011 --> 00:50:49.613
ACTUALEXPERIENCE OF THE PLAN

00:50:49.679 --> 00:50:51.982
ALONG A MEMBERS LIVING --

00:50:52.048 --> 00:50:54.084
SALARY INCREASES EVERYTHING THAT

00:50:54.151 --> 00:50:55.652
YOU CAN THINK ABOUT.

00:50:55.719 --> 00:50:59.189
THAT COULD AFFECT THE MEMBERS

00:50:59.256 --> 00:51:03.026
BENEFIT SO DOES A THE BOARD AND

00:51:03.093 --> 00:51:04.561
THOSE ASSUMPTIONS ARE ADOPTED.

00:51:04.628 --> 00:51:06.396
SO BASICALLY THE WAY YOU MAKE

00:51:06.463 --> 00:51:07.564
SURE THEY'RE APPROPRIATE IS BY

00:51:07.631 --> 00:51:09.399
ENSURING THAT WHAT YOU ASSUME IS

00:51:09.466 --> 00:51:11.401
IN LINE WITH YOUR ACTUAL

00:51:11.468 --> 00:51:13.069
EXPERIENCE OF YOUR PLAN. TO

00:51:13.136 --> 00:51:14.204
ANSWER YOUR OTHER QUESTION ABOUT

00:51:14.271 --> 00:51:17.407
THE FUNDING PERIOD THIS IS MORE

00:51:17.474 --> 00:51:17.974
OF A I'M NOT SURE THERE WAS

00:51:18.041 --> 00:51:19.676
SOMETHING.

00:51:19.743 --> 00:51:21.478
TAKE AN EXACT ANSWER HERE WHEN

00:51:21.545 --> 00:51:22.879
YOU TRY TO FUND A PENSION PLAN

00:51:22.946 --> 00:51:24.014
IT'S ALMOST LIKE THE SAME

00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:25.081
QUESTION YOU HAVE AS AN

00:51:25.148 --> 00:51:26.183
INDIVIDUAL YOU'RE ABOUT TO BY

00:51:26.249 --> 00:51:27.384
YOU FOR WAS HOUSE.

00:51:27.451 --> 00:51:28.985
YOU WALK INTO THE BANK.

00:51:29.052 --> 00:51:30.754
AND NOW YOU ASK YOURSELF SHOULD

00:51:30.821 --> 00:51:32.389
I GET A FIFTEEN YEAR MORTGAGE OR

00:51:32.456 --> 00:51:33.123
SHOULD I GET A THIRTY YEAR

00:51:33.190 --> 00:51:33.990
MORTGAGE.

00:51:34.057 --> 00:51:35.792
IF YOU CAN AFFORD IT.

00:51:35.859 --> 00:51:36.660
I THINK EVERYONE WOULD AGREE

00:51:36.726 --> 00:51:38.328
IT'S PROBABLY BETTER TO HAVE A

00:51:38.395 --> 00:51:39.429
FIFTEEN YEAR MORTGAGE YOU GOING

00:51:39.496 --> 00:51:40.964
TO PAY LESS INTEREST LONG TERM.

00:51:41.031 --> 00:51:42.499
BUT NOT EVERYONE CAN AFFORD IT

00:51:42.566 --> 00:51:44.034
THAT THE FUNDING A PENSION PLAN.

00:51:44.100 --> 00:51:45.302
IS THE SAME THING IT'S A

00:51:45.368 --> 00:51:47.037
BASICALLY IT'S A COMPROMISE

00:51:47.103 --> 00:51:49.039
BETWEEN HOW QUICKLY DO YOU WANT

00:51:49.105 --> 00:51:52.442
TO GET. TO A 100% FUNDED VERSUS

00:51:52.509 --> 00:51:53.877
ALL HIGH THE CONTRIBUTION RATES

00:51:53.944 --> 00:51:55.145
NEED TO BE AND HOW MUCH

00:51:55.212 --> 00:51:57.314
VOLATILITY ARE YOU WILLING TO

00:51:57.380 --> 00:51:58.949
TAKE ON ON THE YEAR TO YEAR

00:51:59.015 --> 00:51:59.850
BASIS.

00:51:59.916 --> 00:52:01.451
SENATOR THERE IS AN EXACT ANSWER

00:52:01.518 --> 00:52:03.119
TO QUESTION IT'S MORE OF A I

00:52:03.186 --> 00:52:04.554
THINK IT'S WHAT MOST OF THE BORE.

00:52:04.621 --> 00:52:06.189
MOST OF THE RETIREMENT SYSTEM

00:52:06.256 --> 00:52:07.390
THE BOARD MEMBERS WILL GO TO

00:52:07.457 --> 00:52:10.227
THIS DISCUSSION WITH IRAQ TREES

00:52:10.293 --> 00:52:14.931
AS TO WHAT'S AN APPROPRIATE --

00:52:14.998 --> 00:52:17.601
FUNDING PERIOD AND BOARD MADE

00:52:17.667 --> 00:52:19.836
THE DECISION GOING FORWARD IN

00:52:19.903 --> 00:52:21.471
THE FUTURE TO GO FROM THIRTY

00:52:21.538 --> 00:52:22.606
YEARS TO A TWENTY YEAR

00:52:22.672 --> 00:52:24.307
AMORTIZATION.

00:52:24.374 --> 00:52:26.510
A FAUCET CAL STIRS --

00:52:26.576 --> 00:52:28.144
DE FUNDING PERIOD AS WAS QUOTED

00:52:28.211 --> 00:52:30.647
EARLIER IS SET IN STATUTE WE'RE

00:52:30.714 --> 00:52:32.849
TRYING TO FIND AND ELIMINATE THE

00:52:32.916 --> 00:52:34.417
UNFUNDED LIABILITY BY TWO

00:52:34.484 --> 00:52:35.819
THOUSAND AND FORTY SIX BUT FOR

00:52:35.886 --> 00:52:37.387
MOST OF THE RETIREMENT SYSTEMS

00:52:37.454 --> 00:52:38.455
IN CALIFORNIA.

00:52:38.522 --> 00:52:40.524
THE BOARD WILL GO THROUGH THIS

00:52:40.590 --> 00:52:43.693
DISCUSSION AND DECIDE WHAT IS AN

00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:44.761
APPROPRIATE FUNDING PERIOD.

00:52:44.828 --> 00:52:49.866
PERIOD THANK YOU MISTER ALAA YES

00:52:49.933 --> 00:52:51.935
SEVEN OVER DOT.

00:52:52.002 --> 00:52:53.937
HOW HAS LIFE EXPECTANCY AND YOU

00:52:54.004 --> 00:52:55.138
MAY NOT YOU I'M YOU MAY NOTICE

00:52:55.205 --> 00:52:55.939
HOW THE TOP YOUR HEAD YOU MAY

00:52:56.006 --> 00:52:57.474
NOT LET'S JUST TAKE MAYBE LAST

00:52:57.541 --> 00:52:57.841
FIFTEEN YEARS?

00:52:57.908 --> 00:53:01.111
HOW HAS LIFE EXPECTANCY CHANGED?

00:53:01.177 --> 00:53:03.747
IT HAS YOU HAVE THE NUMBERS YES

00:53:03.813 --> 00:53:05.415
I DO AN ENTER TO CREATE BUT HOW

00:53:05.482 --> 00:53:07.684
AMONG CREASE. FOR US AT CAL STAR

00:53:07.751 --> 00:53:09.653
IS WE'VE ADDED ALMOST FIVE TO

00:53:09.719 --> 00:53:10.253
SIX YEARS --

00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:11.555
THE OTHER THING THAT'S VERY

00:53:11.621 --> 00:53:16.159
IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT IS OF NOT

00:53:16.226 --> 00:53:17.861
EVERYONE IN THE UNITED STATES.

00:53:17.928 --> 00:53:19.729
LIVE A HAS THE SAME LIFE

00:53:19.796 --> 00:53:20.897
EXPECTANCY FEW LOOK ACROSS THE

00:53:20.964 --> 00:53:22.799
US IT'S QUITE DIFFERENT WE YEAH.

00:53:22.866 --> 00:53:24.568
WE ARE BLESSED IN CALIFORNIA

00:53:24.634 --> 00:53:25.569
BEING IN IN IN THE STATE WHERE

00:53:25.635 --> 00:53:26.570
LIFE EXPECTANCY TENDS TO BE

00:53:26.636 --> 00:53:27.437
LONGER THAN THE REST OF THE

00:53:27.504 --> 00:53:28.338
COUNTRY.

00:53:28.405 --> 00:53:29.739
AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT RETIREMENT

00:53:29.806 --> 00:53:32.542
SYSTEMS IN CALIFORNIA NOT I

00:53:32.609 --> 00:53:33.777
DON'T KNOW IF YOU SAW SAID THERE

00:53:33.843 --> 00:53:35.445
WERE A COUPLE NEW STORIES

00:53:35.512 --> 00:53:38.014
RECENTLY ABOUT THE A STUDY

00:53:38.081 --> 00:53:39.115
RELEASED BY THE SOCIETY OF

00:53:39.182 --> 00:53:40.450
ACTUARIES.

00:53:40.517 --> 00:53:41.585
IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN WELL

00:53:41.651 --> 00:53:43.453
KNOWN TO US BUT FOR EXAMPLE

00:53:43.520 --> 00:53:44.988
TEACHERS HAVE ALWAYS LIVE MUCH

00:53:45.055 --> 00:53:46.122
LONGER THAN THE REST OF THE

00:53:46.189 --> 00:53:47.424
POPULATION.

00:53:47.490 --> 00:53:49.526
IF YOU LOOK AT US AT CAL STARS

00:53:49.593 --> 00:53:51.227
AND YOU COMPARE TO CALPERS CAL

00:53:51.294 --> 00:53:53.530
STAR WAS MEMBERS LIVE ON AVERAGE

00:53:53.597 --> 00:53:54.497
THREE YEARS LONGER THAN THE

00:53:54.564 --> 00:53:55.732
CALPERS MEMBER.

00:53:55.799 --> 00:53:57.133
AND A CALPERS MEMBER LIVE

00:53:57.200 --> 00:53:58.635
SOMETIME ON AVERAGE TWO THREE

00:53:58.702 --> 00:54:00.904
YEARS LONGER THAN YOUR TYPICAL

00:54:00.971 --> 00:54:03.006
SOCIAL SECURITY --

00:54:03.073 --> 00:54:05.508
INDIVIDUAL TO SOMETIME AGO WHEN

00:54:05.575 --> 00:54:07.110
WE HAD A DISCUSSION CAL STARS

00:54:07.177 --> 00:54:08.478
OVER THE PROPER ASSUMPTIONS YOU

00:54:08.545 --> 00:54:09.613
HAVE.

00:54:09.679 --> 00:54:11.581
TO YOU KNOW WHEN THE SYSTEM PAYS

00:54:11.648 --> 00:54:13.583
THAT CALPERS AND CAL STIRS WILL

00:54:13.650 --> 00:54:15.485
BOTH PAYING IN THE FIFTEEN TO

00:54:15.552 --> 00:54:16.219
TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS OF

00:54:16.286 --> 00:54:17.954
BENEFIT TO YOU --

00:54:18.021 --> 00:54:19.589
YOU CAN DO THE MATH QUICKLY WHEN

00:54:19.656 --> 00:54:23.360
YOU ADD ONE YEAR LIFE EXPECTANCY.

00:54:23.426 --> 00:54:25.095
IF THAT IT ADDS UP QUICKLY AND

00:54:25.161 --> 00:54:27.130
SO A A ARE THOSE ASSUMPTIONS.

00:54:27.197 --> 00:54:28.865
THAT YOU MIGHT REBOOT THAT

00:54:28.932 --> 00:54:30.000
NUMBER IN FUTURE YEARS ARE THOSE

00:54:30.066 --> 00:54:31.167
ASSUMPTIONS BUILT IN YOUR

00:54:31.234 --> 00:54:33.003
PROJECTIONS THEY ARE SO RIGHT

00:54:33.069 --> 00:54:34.170
NOW THEY ARE BUILT INTO IT.

00:54:34.237 --> 00:54:35.939
IT IS IT IS PROBABLY THE SECOND

00:54:36.006 --> 00:54:37.907
BIGGEST DRIVER BEHIND COST AFTER

00:54:37.974 --> 00:54:39.643
THE INVESTMENT RETURN ASSUMPTION.

00:54:39.709 --> 00:54:40.877
IS THE WHAT WE CALL THE

00:54:40.944 --> 00:54:42.445
MORTALITY ASSUMPTION OF THE LIFE

00:54:42.512 --> 00:54:44.681
EXPECTANCY AT AND THEN WHAT IS A

00:54:44.748 --> 00:54:47.050
WHAT IS FULLY FUNDED OR 1100%

00:54:47.117 --> 00:54:49.252
FUNDED ME DOESN'T MEAN. FOR THE

00:54:49.319 --> 00:54:51.554
MEMBERS YOU HAVE NOW YOU WON'T

00:54:51.621 --> 00:54:53.790
HAVE TO PUT ANOTHER DOLLAR IN.

00:54:53.857 --> 00:54:55.058
AND THEY WERE AND YEARS AGO WHEN

00:54:55.125 --> 00:54:56.192
I WAS ON THE CITY COUNCIL USE

00:54:56.259 --> 00:54:57.627
THE TERM SUPER FUNDED RIGHT.

00:54:57.694 --> 00:54:58.428
THERE WAS A CLAIM THAT THEY WERE

00:54:58.495 --> 00:54:59.329
SUPER FUN AND I THINK YOU'D

00:54:59.396 --> 00:54:59.996
NEVER HAVE TO PUT ANOTHER DOLLAR

00:55:00.063 --> 00:55:01.431
EVER.

00:55:01.498 --> 00:55:02.732
IN IN IN THE PERSON.

00:55:02.799 --> 00:55:06.036
CAN YOU CAN YOU WHAT WHAT ARE

00:55:06.102 --> 00:55:07.537
THE DIFFERENCES THERE YES SO

00:55:07.604 --> 00:55:09.372
FULLY FUNDED IT DOESN'T MEAN

00:55:09.439 --> 00:55:10.440
YOU'LL NEVER HAVE TO PUT A

00:55:10.507 --> 00:55:11.708
DOLLAR IN.

00:55:11.775 --> 00:55:14.177
A SO FULLY FUNDED MEANS THAT YOU

00:55:14.244 --> 00:55:16.279
HAVE.

00:55:16.346 --> 00:55:18.715
YOU HAVE NO UNFUNDED LIABILITY

00:55:18.782 --> 00:55:20.383
FOR THE SERVICE THAT'S LREADY

00:55:20.450 --> 00:55:21.785
BEEN ACCRUED BY THE MEMBERS

00:55:21.851 --> 00:55:23.720
MISTER SHORTER BEFORE TALKED

00:55:23.787 --> 00:55:25.655
ABOUT THE NORMAL COST.

00:55:25.722 --> 00:55:28.191
ON AN ONGOING BASIS THERE ALWAYS

00:55:28.258 --> 00:55:29.993
NEEDS TO BE A CONTRIBUTION TO

00:55:30.060 --> 00:55:31.928
PAY IF YOU WANT FOR THE SERVICE

00:55:31.995 --> 00:55:33.296
THAT THE MEMBERS ARE ORDERING

00:55:33.363 --> 00:55:34.631
AND THAT YOU.

00:55:34.698 --> 00:55:36.299
MAY KNOW THE REASON BUT WHY MOST

00:55:36.366 --> 00:55:38.334
RETIREMENT SYSTEMS IN CALIFORNIA

00:55:38.401 --> 00:55:39.803
A COLLECTING CONTRIBUTIONS THAT

00:55:39.869 --> 00:55:41.638
EXCEED THE NORMAL COST IS

00:55:41.705 --> 00:55:43.073
BECAUSE MOST SYSTEMS HAVE AN

00:55:43.139 --> 00:55:44.474
UNFUNDED LIABILITY.

00:55:44.541 --> 00:55:45.775
SO THE SYSTEMS ARE TRYING TO

00:55:45.842 --> 00:55:46.910
ELIMINATED.

00:55:46.976 --> 00:55:48.511
SO TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU'RE A

00:55:48.578 --> 00:55:49.879
100% FUNDED.

00:55:49.946 --> 00:55:51.414
THEN THERE WOULD BE THEN THE

00:55:51.481 --> 00:55:52.816
CONTRIBUTION WOULD SIMPLY BE THE

00:55:52.882 --> 00:55:54.117
NORMAL COST.

00:55:54.184 --> 00:55:55.418
A COUPLE YEARS AGO THE TERM

00:55:55.485 --> 00:55:56.986
SUPER FUNDED STARTED TO FLOAT

00:55:57.053 --> 00:56:00.623
AROUND BECAUSE IF YOU GO BACK.

ABOVE A 100% FUNDED.

00:56:05.662 --> 00:56:07.831
AND MANY SYSTEMS NOT ALL BUT

00:56:07.897 --> 00:56:11.901
MANY TOOK ALLOWED EMPLOYERS TO

00:56:11.968 --> 00:56:13.803

CONTRIBUTION HOLIDAY BUT MANY

00:56:18.308 --> 00:56:18.908
DID.

00:56:18.975 --> 00:56:20.677
AND THOSE SYSTEM THOSE PLANS

00:56:20.744 --> 00:56:22.645
WERE OFTEN REFERRED AS SUPER

00:56:22.712 --> 00:56:24.114
FUNDED SO YOU WERE YOU WERE

00:56:24.180 --> 00:56:25.215
ALLOWED TO TAKE SOME KIND OF

00:56:25.281 --> 00:56:26.549
CONTRIBUTION HOLIDAY.

00:56:26.616 --> 00:56:27.584
WHICH NOW.

00:56:27.650 --> 00:56:31.554
WITH GOV REFORM PEPPER ON TWO

00:56:31.621 --> 00:56:33.022
THOUSAND AND THIRTEEN DOES

00:56:33.089 --> 00:56:34.591
CONTRIBUTION HOLIDAYS WILL NO

00:56:34.657 --> 00:56:36.192
LONGER BE ALLOWED IN CALIFORNIA

00:56:36.259 --> 00:56:37.527
SO IF THERE'S EVER A TIME WHERE

00:56:37.594 --> 00:56:39.395
WE ARE ONCE AGAIN.

00:56:39.462 --> 00:56:41.898
WHICH YOU KNOW I HOPE WE DO --

00:56:41.965 --> 00:56:43.199
WHERE WE ARE AND A SURPLUS

00:56:43.266 --> 00:56:45.101
POSITION FROM A FUNDING

00:56:45.168 --> 00:56:47.637
PERSPECTIVE THEN OF CONTRIBUTION

00:56:47.704 --> 00:56:49.806
WOULD STILL HAVE TO FLOW INTO

00:56:49.873 --> 00:56:50.840
THE PENSION SYSTEM?

00:56:50.907 --> 00:56:51.374
AND WITH REGARD TO THE

00:56:51.441 --> 00:56:53.209
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WHICH IS

00:56:53.276 --> 00:56:54.811
THREE BILLION INTO STIRS RIGHT

00:56:54.878 --> 00:56:57.447
WAS IT ONLY STIRS.

00:56:57.514 --> 00:56:59.082
IT'LL BUT IT'S BASICALLY FOR

00:56:59.149 --> 00:57:00.517
YEAH SO FOR US IT'S A

00:57:00.583 --> 00:57:01.985
FORECASTERS IT WOULD BE.

00:57:02.051 --> 00:57:03.419
BASICALLY I THINK IN THE COMING

00:57:03.486 --> 00:57:05.288
BUDGET YEAR FOUR POINT ONE

00:57:05.355 --> 00:57:07.290
BILLION TWO CAL STIRS AN ADDICT

00:57:07.357 --> 00:57:08.725
THREE BILLION TO CALPERS AND

00:57:08.792 --> 00:57:09.926
IT'S REALLY ONLY A HOLIDAY FOR

00:57:09.993 --> 00:57:12.328
TWO YEARS OUT ITS NOT A HOLIDAY

00:57:12.395 --> 00:57:14.831
IT'S JUST TO PAY OFF THE ARE NOT

00:57:14.898 --> 00:57:15.632
A LOT OF LEADER IT'S IT'S SOME

00:57:15.698 --> 00:57:15.932
IT'S PART.

00:57:15.999 --> 00:57:16.900
OF A HOLIDAY BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT

00:57:16.966 --> 00:57:18.434
RAISING IT TO THE LEVEL THAT

00:57:18.501 --> 00:57:19.536
THEY WOULD OTHERWISE CORRECT

00:57:19.602 --> 00:57:22.005
IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENCE OF

00:57:22.071 --> 00:57:23.673
FOR THE FOR THE THREE BILLION

00:57:23.740 --> 00:57:25.942
THAT'S COMING TO CALLAS STAR IS

00:57:26.009 --> 00:57:27.477
ON BEHALF OF THE EMPLOYER IS.

00:57:27.544 --> 00:57:29.345
WHAT THE WHAT THE PROPOSAL IS TO

00:57:29.412 --> 00:57:31.181
YOU WAS SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION TO

00:57:31.247 --> 00:57:33.283
PAY THE AMOUNT ON BEHALF OF THE

00:57:33.349 --> 00:57:34.050
EMPLOYER IS RIGHT?

00:57:34.117 --> 00:57:35.652
AND THE OTHER TWO POINT THREE

00:57:35.718 --> 00:57:37.754
BILLION TO REDUCE THE SIZE OF

00:57:37.821 --> 00:57:41.191
THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY SO IT'S A

00:57:41.257 --> 00:57:44.294
IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF BOTH.

00:57:44.360 --> 00:57:47.463
THANK YOU THANK YOU DR BEN.

00:57:47.530 --> 00:57:49.799
I THANK YOU.

00:57:49.866 --> 00:57:51.367
IT YOUR PRESENTATION WHEN THINGS --

00:57:51.434 --> 00:57:53.636
AS I HEAR YOUR ANSWER --

00:57:53.703 --> 00:57:54.938
TO SUMMER MCDONALD'S QUESTION IS --

00:57:55.004 --> 00:57:55.905
IS REALLY THINKING ABOUT HOW DO

00:57:55.972 --> 00:57:56.940
WE COMMUNICATE TO THE PUBLIC

00:57:57.006 --> 00:57:59.542
THIS WHOLE --

00:57:59.609 --> 00:58:01.811
TERM OF FUNDED UNDER FUNDED OVER

00:58:01.878 --> 00:58:03.813
FUNDED SUPER FUNDED OR WHATEVER.

00:58:03.880 --> 00:58:07.083
BECAUSE I THINK UNFORTUNATELY AS

00:58:07.150 --> 00:58:08.718
WE HEAR TRY TO MAKE PUBLIC

00:58:08.785 --> 00:58:10.486
POLICY AND MAKE THE RULES LIKE

00:58:10.553 --> 00:58:13.056
PEPPER OTHER TYPES RULE.

00:58:13.122 --> 00:58:15.992
THE THE HELP GOVERN --

00:58:16.059 --> 00:58:16.226
BOTH --

00:58:16.292 --> 00:58:17.627
STIRS IN PERSON.

00:58:17.694 --> 00:58:18.828
THAT I THINK PUBLIC

00:58:18.895 --> 00:58:21.331
MISPERCEPTIONS ARE AN ABILITY TO

00:58:21.397 --> 00:58:22.999
CLEARLY COMMUNICATE WHAT DOES IT

00:58:23.066 --> 00:58:23.800
MEAN WHEN SOMEONE SAYS YOU'RE

00:58:23.867 --> 00:58:26.402
FULLY FUNDED OR YOU'RE UNDER

00:58:26.469 --> 00:58:28.805
FUNDED OR YOUR SUPER FUNDED --

00:58:28.872 --> 00:58:30.707
CAN LEAD TO BAD POLICY MAKING

00:58:30.773 --> 00:58:32.342
BECAUSE I THINK WITHOUT A TRUE

00:58:32.408 --> 00:58:33.843
UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THAT

00:58:33.910 --> 00:58:35.545
REALLY MEANS.

00:58:35.612 --> 00:58:37.347
WE START MAKING BAD POLICY

00:58:37.413 --> 00:58:39.482
DECISIONS WE CAN ARGUE ABOUT THE

00:58:39.549 --> 00:58:41.317
PENSION HOLIDAYS ARE MADE RIGHT

00:58:41.384 --> 00:58:42.185
WHAT WAS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN

00:58:42.252 --> 00:58:43.052
WHEN YOU'RE FULLY FUNDED OR

00:58:43.119 --> 00:58:44.520
SUPER FUNDED RIGHT WHAT DOES

00:58:44.587 --> 00:58:45.622
THAT REALLY MEAN SO.

00:58:45.688 --> 00:58:46.823
I GUESS I WOULD URGE AND I KNOW

00:58:46.890 --> 00:58:47.056
THAT --

00:58:47.123 --> 00:58:48.224
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE --

00:58:48.291 --> 00:58:49.993
THE OTHER SYSTEMS COME UP MORE

00:58:50.059 --> 00:58:50.860
SPECIFICALLY ON THE ACTARIAL

00:58:50.927 --> 00:58:52.462
SIDE TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE

00:58:52.528 --> 00:58:54.898
COMMUNICATE THESE THINGS RIGHT

00:58:54.964 --> 00:58:55.465
NOW WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO

00:58:55.531 --> 00:58:56.799
COMMUNICATE WHAT DOES IT MEAN

00:58:56.866 --> 00:58:58.001
THAT WERE UNDER FUNDED RIGHT

00:58:58.067 --> 00:58:59.035
THERE'S A LOT OF ANXIETY ABOUT

00:58:59.102 --> 00:59:00.837
THAT WATER UNFUNDED LIABILITY IS

00:59:00.904 --> 00:59:02.372
AND I THINK THERE'S SOME.

00:59:02.438 --> 00:59:04.674
MISPERCEPTIONS ABOUT THAT AND

00:59:04.741 --> 00:59:06.042
THEN ALSO IF.

00:59:06.109 --> 00:59:06.943
I HOPE WE GET TO A SITUATION

00:59:07.010 --> 00:59:07.877
WHERE WE CAN SAY WERE FULLY

00:59:07.944 --> 00:59:08.778
FUNDED BUT WHAT DOES THAT REALLY

00:59:08.845 --> 00:59:10.980
MEAN RIGHT THAT DOESN'T MEAN

00:59:11.047 --> 00:59:11.981
THAT -- WELL

00:59:12.048 --> 00:59:13.116
ALL THE MONEY'S THERE WE CAN

00:59:13.182 --> 00:59:15.818
JUST WALK AWAY AND OR YOU DON'T

00:59:15.885 --> 00:59:17.954
NOW WE CAN GIVES MORE STUFF AWAY

00:59:18.021 --> 00:59:18.821
RIGHT -- AND

00:59:18.888 --> 00:59:19.422
WE KNOW THE MARKETS GO UP AND

00:59:19.489 --> 00:59:22.458
DOWN OVER FUNDED IS WHEN THE

00:59:22.525 --> 00:59:24.327
MARKET'S UP IN WHEN THE MARKET

00:59:24.394 --> 00:59:25.895
FALLS THAT UNDER FUNDED THAT.

00:59:25.962 --> 00:59:27.764
FULLY FUND THEIR SUPER FUND IT'S

00:59:27.830 --> 00:59:29.299
ONLY BECOMES UNDERFUNDED GREAT.

00:59:29.365 --> 00:59:31.034
ARE UNFUNDED LIABILITY SO I

00:59:31.100 --> 00:59:32.635
GUESS THAT WOULD BE MY PLEA TO

00:59:32.702 --> 00:59:33.636

00:59:41.544 --> 00:59:43.379
CAN COMMUNICATE OR CONSTITUENTS.

00:59:43.446 --> 00:59:44.314

01:01:56.479 --> 01:01:58.381
BILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR AND

01:01:58.448 --> 01:01:59.715
PENSION BENEFITS SEND MOST OF

01:01:59.782 --> 01:02:01.918
THOSE BENEFITS ARE BEING SPENT

01:02:01.984 --> 01:02:03.286
IN CALIFORNIA.

01:02:03.352 --> 01:02:04.120
SO WE'VE TALKED A LITTLE BIT

01:02:04.187 --> 01:02:05.421
ABOUT THE EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTION

01:02:05.488 --> 01:02:07.824
RATES THE NUMBER CONTRIBUTIONS

01:02:07.890 --> 01:02:09.125
THAT TWO THIRDS OF THAT BENEFIT

01:02:09.192 --> 01:02:10.526
IS ACTUALLY BEING PAID OUT OF

01:02:10.593 --> 01:02:12.028
THE INVESTMENT RETURNS WHICH IS

01:02:12.095 --> 01:02:13.329
WHY THIS ROLE SITTING NEXT ME

01:02:13.396 --> 01:02:14.430
THIS PERSON SITTING NEXT TO ME

01:02:14.497 --> 01:02:15.965
IS REALLY CRITICALLY IMPORTANT

01:02:16.032 --> 01:02:17.433
TO THE SYSTEM.

01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:19.469
AND THE OVERALL HEALTH.

01:02:19.535 --> 01:02:20.369
NOT MAJOR DECISIONS HAVE BEEN

01:02:20.436 --> 01:02:22.905
MADE IN TWO THOUSAND AND

01:02:22.972 --> 01:02:24.107
SEVENTEEN THAT SYSTEM SET AT

01:02:24.173 --> 01:02:26.943
ABOUT 68% FUNDED ARE MEETING

01:02:27.009 --> 01:02:29.245
WITH 68% OF THE ASSETS NEEDED TO

01:02:29.312 --> 01:02:30.680
PAY FOR THE BENEFITS OF THE

01:02:30.746 --> 01:02:31.848
LIABILITIES.

01:02:31.914 --> 01:02:34.317
AS OF JUNE THIRTIETH OF TWO

01:02:34.383 --> 01:02:35.785
THOUSAND EIGHTEEN A SYSTEM SET

01:02:35.852 --> 01:02:37.386
AT 71%.

01:02:37.453 --> 01:02:38.754
AND THERE ARE SOME DECISIONS

01:02:38.821 --> 01:02:41.757
THAT HAD TO BE MADE AGAIN.

01:02:41.824 --> 01:02:43.693
TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SYSTEM WAS

01:02:43.759 --> 01:02:45.561
IN A SUSTAINABLE --

01:02:45.628 --> 01:02:47.630
PLACE THINK EVERYONE HAS THEIR

01:02:47.697 --> 01:02:48.397
COPIES DOWN.

01:02:48.464 --> 01:02:49.398
AND THE FIRST DECISION THAT WAS

01:02:49.465 --> 01:02:49.966
MADE AND THAT WAS ACTUALLY

01:02:50.032 --> 01:02:52.101
DECEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND AND

01:02:52.168 --> 01:02:53.169
SIXTEEN WE TALKED ABOUT THE

01:02:53.236 --> 01:02:54.470
LOWERING OFTHE DISCOUNT RATE.

01:02:54.537 --> 01:02:56.038
SO WE LOWERED IT FROM SEVEN

01:02:56.105 --> 01:02:59.509
POINT FIVE THE STEPS AND WE

01:02:59.575 --> 01:03:01.177
HEARD LOUD AND CLEAR FROM OUR

01:03:01.244 --> 01:03:02.145
THREE THOUSAND PUBLIC EMPLOYERS

01:03:02.211 --> 01:03:04.413
THAT THEY NEEDED TO PLAN FOR

01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:06.382
THOSE REDUCTIONS THROUGH A MORE

01:03:06.449 --> 01:03:08.718
METHODICAL WAY I EAT DON'T PUSH

01:03:08.784 --> 01:03:09.252
THAT OUT IN A WHEN YEAR

01:03:09.318 --> 01:03:10.686
REDUCTION AND GIVE US A LITTLE.

01:03:10.753 --> 01:03:11.988
BIT OF TIME TO PLAN FOR THAT IN

01:03:12.054 --> 01:03:14.023
OUR BUDGETS SO WE DID THAT THE

01:03:14.090 --> 01:03:15.324
STATE TOOK IT IN THE FIRST YEAR

01:03:15.391 --> 01:03:16.626
SCHOOLS AND LOCAL STICK IT IN

01:03:16.692 --> 01:03:17.760
THE SECOND YEAR.

01:03:17.827 --> 01:03:19.562
AND WE ARE MOVING THROUGH ALL OF

01:03:19.629 --> 01:03:21.531
OUR VALUATION REPORTS AND

01:03:21.597 --> 01:03:22.465
LOWERING THAT AGAIN THAT

01:03:22.532 --> 01:03:24.767
DISCOUNT RATE DOWN TO SEVEN OF

01:03:24.834 --> 01:03:26.769
WHICH THE STATE IS AT SEVEN I'LL

01:03:26.836 --> 01:03:27.537
ASPIN TO TALK ABOUT THE ASSET

01:03:27.603 --> 01:03:28.571
ALLOCATION.

01:03:28.638 --> 01:03:29.939
BUT WE ALSO SPOKE A LITTLE BIT

01:03:30.006 --> 01:03:31.107
ABOUT THE SHORTER AMORTIZATION

01:03:31.174 --> 01:03:32.441
WHERE WE TOOK THE THIRTY YEAR

01:03:32.508 --> 01:03:34.243
AMORTIZATION AND WE LOWERED IT

01:03:34.310 --> 01:03:34.977
TO TWENTY YEAR.

01:03:35.044 --> 01:03:36.112
AND THE TWENTY YEARS ONLY FOR

01:03:36.179 --> 01:03:38.014
FUTURE GAINS AND LOSSES AT THE

01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:39.148
THIRTY YEAR REMAINS IN EFFECT

01:03:39.215 --> 01:03:40.616
FOR ALL FORMER --

01:03:40.683 --> 01:03:42.451
GAINS OR LOSSES RELATED TO THE

01:03:42.518 --> 01:03:43.486
U. L..

01:03:43.553 --> 01:03:44.620
AND ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE

01:03:44.687 --> 01:03:46.055
DID THAT TWICE WE SOUGHT

01:03:46.122 --> 01:03:47.690
NEGATIVE AMORTIZATION AND IN THE

01:03:47.757 --> 01:03:49.492
FUND AND THAT IS NOT A GOOD

01:03:49.559 --> 01:03:50.626
FINANCIAL POSITION --

01:03:50.693 --> 01:03:52.228
FINANCIAL POLICY FOR THE

01:03:52.295 --> 01:03:53.996
ORGANIZATION SO AGAIN WORKING

01:03:54.063 --> 01:03:55.298
THROUGH NUMEROUS STAKEHOLDERS

01:03:55.364 --> 01:03:56.799
THE EMPLOYERS REALLY WORKING

01:03:56.866 --> 01:03:59.502
THROUGH THE AFFECTS OF THAT KIND

01:03:59.569 --> 01:04:00.870
OF CHANGE ON BUDGETS.

01:04:00.937 --> 01:04:03.072
SO WE WERE ABLE TO GET THAT IN

01:04:03.139 --> 01:04:04.373
PLACE.

01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:06.108
AND WE ALSO TALKED A LITTLE BIT

01:04:06.175 --> 01:04:07.944
ABOUT THE EXTRA CONTRIBUTIONS

01:04:08.010 --> 01:04:09.412
THAT HAVE COME INTO CALPERS SO

01:04:09.478 --> 01:04:10.513
GOVERNOR BROWN AND THIS

01:04:10.580 --> 01:04:12.481
LEGISLATIVE BODY SIX BILLION

DOLLARS CAME INTO THE PLANET TWO

01:04:15.151 --> 01:04:15.651

THE FACES REALLY DO A FEW

01:06:54.009 --> 01:06:55.878

01:08:11.854 --> 01:08:12.855
A LONG TERM FOCUS SO THAT'S

01:08:12.922 --> 01:08:14.023
WHERE WE SEE THAT UNIQUE

01:08:14.089 --> 01:08:14.990

SECTION FROM MY MY TALK HERE IS

01:08:44.119 --> 01:08:45.521
THE IMPORTANCE OF FOR PROBABLY

01:08:45.588 --> 01:08:46.889
MARKET.

01:08:46.956 --> 01:08:48.824
SO IT IF YOU LOOK AT CALPERS OUR

01:08:48.891 --> 01:08:49.592
HISTORY.

01:08:49.658 --> 01:08:50.526
WILL OUR OWN EXPERIENCE IN THE

01:08:50.593 --> 01:08:52.595
PAST TWENTY YEARS PRIVATE EQUITY

01:08:52.661 --> 01:08:54.463
IS A THE ONLY ASSET CLASS AT

01:08:54.530 --> 01:08:55.631
DELIVERED A RETURN THAT HIGHER

01:08:55.698 --> 01:08:56.832
THAN 7%.

01:08:56.899 --> 01:08:58.267
AS YOU CAN SEE THE ONSLAUGHT ON

01:08:58.334 --> 01:08:59.268
THE NEXT SLIDE.

01:08:59.335 --> 01:09:01.003
UP IN THE PAST TWENTY YEAR

01:09:01.070 --> 01:09:03.105
PERIOD PRIVATE EQUITY DELIVERED

01:09:03.172 --> 01:09:04.974
TO ATTEND A HALF PERCENT AND THE

01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:07.143
LAST YEAR A THEATER WITH US --

01:09:07.209 --> 01:09:08.277
16%.

01:09:08.344 --> 01:09:09.612
AND WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT GOING

01:09:09.678 --> 01:09:12.248
FORWARD PRIVATE EQUITY IS EYES

01:09:12.314 --> 01:09:14.617
ACOSTA DOUBLE GIVE US THE HIGHS

01:09:14.683 --> 01:09:20.089
CHONG'S.

01:09:20.155 --> 01:09:22.791
TO ACHIEVE THE 7%.

01:09:22.858 --> 01:09:24.760
AND SO THE AS DO SOME OF YOU

01:09:24.827 --> 01:09:26.428
KNOW THAT'S THE AWAY ARE

01:09:26.495 --> 01:09:27.530
EXPLORING BECAUSE WE NEED A

01:09:27.596 --> 01:09:29.398
PRIVATE EQUITY TO ACHIEVE THE

01:09:29.465 --> 01:09:30.933
REQUIRED ME --

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:31.534
TO RETURN AND ALSO PROVIDE THE

01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:33.969
STATE -- AND

01:09:34.036 --> 01:09:35.971
WE CAN DO SO --

01:09:36.038 --> 01:09:37.973
TO SYLVIA MOST MARK IN THE MODE

01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:40.075
RISK PRUDENTLY IN A SMART WAY

01:09:40.142 --> 01:09:41.744
NEAR SMARTLY WHAT I MEAN BY THAT

01:09:41.810 --> 01:09:43.112
IS REALLY.

01:09:43.178 --> 01:09:44.446
TO TAKE A LOT FIRST AND THEN THE

01:09:44.513 --> 01:09:46.749
FLY OUR COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGES

01:09:46.815 --> 01:09:48.484
AND THEN A TAKE A WANTED TO

01:09:48.551 --> 01:09:49.051
FIGURE OUT A YOU MUST MISS

01:09:49.118 --> 01:09:50.920
STRATEGY TO TAKE A LONGER TO OFF

01:09:50.986 --> 01:09:53.556
OUR A STRUCTURE.

01:09:53.622 --> 01:09:55.391
OF THE MONTH TO JUICE AND ONE OF

01:09:55.457 --> 01:09:58.360
THESE TO TO A TO DO SO IS REALLY.

01:09:58.427 --> 01:10:00.462
TO IMPART TO INCREASE OUR ALL

01:10:00.529 --> 01:10:02.131
ALLOCATION TO PRIVATE EQUITY --

01:10:02.197 --> 01:10:03.532
AND WE WILL HAVE BEEN TALKING

01:10:03.599 --> 01:10:05.267
ABOUT TO TO ADDITIONAL BUSINESS

01:10:05.334 --> 01:10:07.169
MODELS IN ADDITION TO WHAT ABOUT

01:10:07.236 --> 01:10:09.271
DOING NOW WHICH IS THE CALPERS

01:10:09.338 --> 01:10:11.807
INNOVATION AND A CELL CALPERS

01:10:11.874 --> 01:10:12.775
PARTISAN FONT.

01:10:12.841 --> 01:10:14.009
SO THESE ARE THE NEW IDEAS WE

01:10:14.076 --> 01:10:15.411
ARE EXPLORING WAYS --

01:10:15.477 --> 01:10:21.083
WITH THE INVESTMENT COMMITTEE AT

01:10:21.150 --> 01:10:23.652
CALPERS -- I

01:10:23.719 --> 01:10:25.955
THINK WE CAN SKIP THE LAST SLIDE

01:10:26.021 --> 01:10:28.223
ON THE ALREADY IN CAVES AND

01:10:28.290 --> 01:10:29.792
ENGAGEMENT AND DIVERSE MEANT ALL

01:10:29.858 --> 01:10:30.659
POLICIES.

01:10:30.726 --> 01:10:32.394
AND TURN OF BACK TO MARCY FOR

01:10:32.461 --> 01:10:34.229
THE CLOSING REMARKS AND THEN

01:10:34.296 --> 01:10:35.130
WE'LL BE READY TO ALL FEEL

01:10:35.197 --> 01:10:36.365
QUESTIONS ALRIGHT SO JUSTIN KEY

01:10:36.432 --> 01:10:37.700
TAKE AWAYS ONE OF THE THINGS WE

01:10:37.766 --> 01:10:38.334
WANTED TO DO WITH YOU ALL THIS

01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:39.234
MORNING IS TO UNDERSTAND THE

01:10:39.301 --> 01:10:40.235
STRATEGIES THAT WE ARE WORKING

01:10:40.302 --> 01:10:40.803
ON TO IMPROVE THE FUNDED.

01:10:40.869 --> 01:10:43.339
STATUS 70% IS CERTAINLY A VITAL

01:10:43.405 --> 01:10:44.239
SIGN ARTS A VITAL SIGN IT'S

01:10:44.306 --> 01:10:44.873
COMMUNICATED OUT TO THE MEMBERS

01:10:44.940 --> 01:10:46.575
AND TO THE PUBLIC ABOUT HOW

01:10:46.642 --> 01:10:47.643
HEALTHY IS CALPERS.

01:10:47.710 --> 01:10:50.879
SO WE TAKE THAT VERY SERIOUSLY

01:10:50.946 --> 01:10:53.616
WE HAVE IT IN OUR OWN INNER IN A

01:10:53.682 --> 01:10:55.751
RED INDICATOR FRANCIS 70% IS A

01:10:55.818 --> 01:10:57.119
RED INDICATOR TO GET INTO A

01:10:57.186 --> 01:10:58.487
YELLOW INDICATOR WERE THINKING

01:10:58.554 --> 01:10:59.888
EIGHTY PERCENTILE TO GET INTO A

01:10:59.955 --> 01:11:00.723
GREEN INDICATOR.

01:11:00.789 --> 01:11:04.126
THAT'S GOING TO BE A 95% FUNDED

01:11:04.193 --> 01:11:05.461
STATUS AND NAY STRATEGIES ARE

01:11:05.527 --> 01:11:07.029
LONG TERM THESE ARE TWENTY

01:11:07.096 --> 01:11:07.663
THIRTY YEARS STRATEGIES THIS IS

01:11:07.730 --> 01:11:08.764
NOT A FIX THAT WILL HAPPEN

01:11:08.831 --> 01:11:09.898
OVERNIGHT.

01:11:09.965 --> 01:11:11.634
BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE 7%

01:11:11.700 --> 01:11:13.068
RETURN TARGET IS SOMETHING THAT

01:11:13.135 --> 01:11:14.570
OUR INVESTMENT OFFICE HAS TO

01:11:14.637 --> 01:11:16.238
FOCUS ON AND ONE OF THE WAYS

01:11:16.305 --> 01:11:17.840
THAT THEY WANT TO FOCUS IS

01:11:17.906 --> 01:11:19.775
REALLY LOOKING AT THE PRIVATE

01:11:19.842 --> 01:11:21.410
EQUITY OR PRIVATE MARKETS.

01:11:21.477 --> 01:11:22.411
AND LEVERAGING THOSE PRIVATE

01:11:22.478 --> 01:11:24.046
MARKETS TO HELP US ATTAIN THAT

01:11:24.113 --> 01:11:26.482
7% NOW THAT COMES THAT'S A VERY

01:11:26.548 --> 01:11:27.650
HIGH REWARD --

01:11:27.716 --> 01:11:29.785
TARGET 7% HIGH REWARD YOU HAVE

01:11:29.852 --> 01:11:31.286
TO TAKE SOME RISK AND YOU HAVE

01:11:31.353 --> 01:11:32.554
TO USE INNOVATION TO GET THERE

01:11:32.621 --> 01:11:33.656
BUT WE HAVE TO BE VERY PRUDENT

01:11:33.722 --> 01:11:35.190
ABOUT THE RISKS THAT WERE TAKING

01:11:35.257 --> 01:11:36.558
BECAUSE AGAIN NOT BEING FULLY

01:11:36.625 --> 01:11:37.993
FUNDED WE HAVE TO BE.

01:11:38.060 --> 01:11:39.428
CAREFULLY MONITORING THAT FUNDED

01:11:39.495 --> 01:11:42.097

01:14:37.639 --> 01:14:38.140
WELL IF YOU HAVE MORE MONEY

01:14:38.207 --> 01:14:40.409
GOING OUT AND COMING AND THAT

01:14:40.475 --> 01:14:42.611
ALSO MEANS THAT YOU MAY HAVE TO

01:14:42.678 --> 01:14:44.246
HAVE A LARGER CASH POSITION YOU

01:14:44.313 --> 01:14:45.881
MAY HAVE TO BE WHEN ANYONE WHO'S

01:14:45.948 --> 01:14:47.049
BY THE MONEY MARKET.

01:14:47.115 --> 01:14:48.383
ARE DOES THAT THAT RETURN IS A

01:14:48.450 --> 01:14:49.985
BIT DIFFERENT THAN WHAT YOU CAN

01:14:50.052 --> 01:14:51.386
GET THE STOCK MARKET.

01:14:51.453 --> 01:14:53.088
AND ALSO THAT MEANS THAT SO YOU

01:14:53.155 --> 01:14:54.089
HAVE TO HAVE A MORE CONSERVATIVE

01:14:54.156 --> 01:14:55.624
THERE SHOULD BE SURE OF THE CASH

01:14:55.691 --> 01:14:57.359
TO MEET YOUR OBLIGATIONS YOUR

01:14:57.426 --> 01:14:58.660
OBJECT CURRENT OBLIGATIONS NOT

01:14:58.727 --> 01:15:03.966
JUST IN THE FUTURE ONES AND SO --

01:15:04.032 --> 01:15:04.600
AND SO JUST A I THINK ALSO THAT

01:15:04.666 --> 01:15:07.703
ALL BECAUSE GIVING THAT

01:15:07.769 --> 01:15:09.771
LIQUIDITY SO IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT --

01:15:09.838 --> 01:15:10.372
I HAVE A CHUNK OF MONEY I CAN

01:15:10.439 --> 01:15:12.341
JUST TAKE IT ALL THE SB FIVE

01:15:12.407 --> 01:15:13.275
HUNDRED AND WHICH HAS A NINE

01:15:13.342 --> 01:15:14.243
POINT NINE THE AND ALL THREE

01:15:14.309 --> 01:15:15.711
YEAR RETURN IT'S ADDRESS THAT

01:15:15.777 --> 01:15:16.979
YOU HAVE TO HAVE THAT BALANCE

01:15:17.045 --> 01:15:18.413
AND MAKES THE RIGHT OUT.

01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:19.748
YOU WON'T BE KEPT TRYING TO

01:15:19.815 --> 01:15:21.083
LIQUIDATE ASSETS.

01:15:21.149 --> 01:15:22.651
WHEN THE MARKET'S DOWN RIGHT

01:15:22.718 --> 01:15:23.318
BECAUSE THEN YOU REALLY HAVE TO

01:15:23.385 --> 01:15:25.153
TAKE THE LOSS YOU CAN'T IT'S NOT

01:15:25.220 --> 01:15:26.588
TO THE PAPER LOSSES REAL LOSS SO

01:15:26.655 --> 01:15:27.890
I GUESS THE OTHER QUESTION THOSE

01:15:27.956 --> 01:15:28.991
AROUND THE PRIVATE EQUITY IN

01:15:29.057 --> 01:15:31.827
NICE CERTAINLY HEAR WHAT YOU'RE

01:15:31.894 --> 01:15:33.428
SAYING ABOUT PRIVATE EQUITY?

01:15:33.495 --> 01:15:34.630
AT THE SAME TIME A I THINK THERE

01:15:34.696 --> 01:15:36.398
IS PUBLIC CONCERN ABOUT SOME

01:15:36.465 --> 01:15:38.200
THESE PRIVATE EQUITY GROUPS

01:15:38.267 --> 01:15:40.002
BECAUSE SOME OF THEM CHARGE VERY

01:15:40.068 --> 01:15:41.236
LARGE FEES.

01:15:41.303 --> 01:15:42.504
SO FORTH SO --

01:15:42.571 --> 01:15:44.539
AND AGAIN --

01:15:44.606 --> 01:15:45.941
YEAH WE THINK ABOUT CALPERS IS A

01:15:46.008 --> 01:15:47.709
VERY BIG SYSTEM WORD PROBABLY

01:15:47.776 --> 01:15:49.912
COMPARED TO OTHER INVESTORS WERE

01:15:49.978 --> 01:15:51.513
NOT SO BIG GUY THERE CERTAINLY.

01:15:51.580 --> 01:15:53.015
NOW SOVEREIGN WEALTH FUNDS OTHER

01:15:53.081 --> 01:15:53.615
TYPES OF THINGS OUT THERE AS

01:15:53.682 --> 01:15:55.417
WELL BUT TO WHAT DEGREE DO YOU

01:15:55.484 --> 01:15:56.251
THINK.

01:15:56.318 --> 01:15:58.020
WHAT STEPS CALPERS IS ABLE TO

01:15:58.086 --> 01:16:00.522
TAKE? ONE AS YOU ARE IN THE

01:16:00.589 --> 01:16:02.190
PRIVATE EQUITY MARKET TO TRY.

01:16:02.257 --> 01:16:03.525
TO NOT JUST MAXIMIZE RETURNS

01:16:03.592 --> 01:16:05.127
THAT'S ALWAYS THE GOAL ONE BUT

01:16:05.193 --> 01:16:06.662
ALSO SOMETIMES RETURNS ARE

01:16:06.728 --> 01:16:08.297
DEPEND ON WHAT FEES PEOPLE TAKE

01:16:08.363 --> 01:16:09.631
OUT AS WELL AND WILL OFTEN SEE

01:16:09.698 --> 01:16:10.933
ARTICLES CRITICIZING THE LEVEL

01:16:10.999 --> 01:16:13.135
FEES THAT ARE BEING CHARGED BY.

01:16:13.201 --> 01:16:15.003
THESE PRIVATE EQUITY FUND SO

01:16:15.070 --> 01:16:16.738
WHAT ARE WE GONNA WHERE THINGS

01:16:16.805 --> 01:16:18.674
CALPERS CAN DO.

01:16:18.740 --> 01:16:19.341
TO LOWER THE FEES WHICH ACTUALLY

01:16:19.408 --> 01:16:20.475
THAT INCREASES OUR RETURNS AS

01:16:20.542 --> 01:16:23.478
WELL AND AND STILL BE ABLE TO

01:16:23.545 --> 01:16:25.547
PARTICIPATE IN THIS.

01:16:25.614 --> 01:16:27.716
TELL US INDEPENDENCE BERKELEY

01:16:27.783 --> 01:16:30.118
QUESTIONS SO YOU GO TO SLIDE

01:16:30.185 --> 01:16:32.688
FIFTEEN TO NEW PROPOSALS THAT --

01:16:32.754 --> 01:16:34.022
UNDER DISCUSSION UNDER

01:16:34.089 --> 01:16:36.425
CONSIDERATION CALPERS IN THE

01:16:36.491 --> 01:16:38.327
INNOVATION HARDER THAN FUND

01:16:38.393 --> 01:16:39.528
COUNSEL YOU OUGHT TO WRITE THAT

01:16:39.594 --> 01:16:41.263
YOU KNOW --

01:16:41.330 --> 01:16:44.299
IT COULD GET THEIR TWO POINTS --

01:16:44.366 --> 01:16:45.734
WE LOOK AT A PRIVATE PRIVATE

01:16:45.801 --> 01:16:47.769
EQUITY AND I SAT CLASS A. HAS

01:16:47.836 --> 01:16:52.708
DUE TO DELIVER THE BEST

01:16:52.774 --> 01:16:55.811
PERFORMANCE TO ASSUME THAT HE'S

01:16:55.877 --> 01:16:57.045
I COULD BE AS HIGH AS A CLASS

01:16:57.112 --> 01:16:57.813
THAT WE DO NOT LIKE.

01:16:57.879 --> 01:16:59.748
FOCUS ON THE HIGHER FEES BUT

01:16:59.815 --> 01:17:01.650
AGAIN THE PULLED UP ALL

01:17:01.717 --> 01:17:03.719
PERFORMANCE WHERE CODING IS

01:17:03.785 --> 01:17:05.287
NIGHT OF THE FEES EVEN AFTER ALL

01:17:05.354 --> 01:17:07.356
THE FEES EXPENSES TO THE BEST

01:17:07.422 --> 01:17:08.924
PERFORMING ASSET CLASS.

01:17:08.991 --> 01:17:10.559
BUT THERE ARE THINGS I DECIDED

01:17:10.625 --> 01:17:12.327
HIGHER FEES LACK OF TRANSPARENCY

01:17:12.394 --> 01:17:14.062
LACK OF CONTROL.

01:17:14.129 --> 01:17:15.630
AND THAT THAT'S EXACTLY WHY WE

01:17:15.697 --> 01:17:17.933
ARE PROPOSING AND CONSIDERING A

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.135
SLIGHT FIFTEEN OFFSET FIFTEEN

01:17:20.202 --> 01:17:21.570

INNOVATION WAS ALL YOU KNOW

01:17:32.848 --> 01:17:36.251
PATIENT IT'S LESS LIKELY WILL WE

01:17:36.318 --> 01:17:37.152
CAN GET THAT TARGETS.

01:17:37.219 --> 01:17:40.222
BUT DOING INNOVATION --

01:17:40.288 --> 01:17:40.756
DOING IT --

01:17:40.822 --> 01:17:41.790

NEW PIECES MODELED ON THE

01:17:43.225 --> 01:17:45.327
CONSIDERATION WILL REDUCE THE

01:17:45.394 --> 01:17:46.094

BUT FOR US HERE IN GOVERNMENT

01:20:53.014 --> 01:20:55.650
IT'S VERY CLEAR WE ARE

01:20:55.717 --> 01:20:57.018
ABSOLUTELY FIDUCIARY SO.

01:20:57.085 --> 01:20:58.286

SAVINGS ACCOUNT BALANCE IN THE

01:21:16.304 --> 01:21:17.405
UNITED STATES.

01:21:17.472 --> 01:21:19.341
SO THIS IS THE MEDIAN AMOUNT OF

01:21:19.407 --> 01:21:22.177
MONEY PEOPLE HAVE.

01:21:22.244 --> 01:21:23.945
IN A SAVINGS ACCOUNT.

01:21:24.012 --> 01:21:24.579
YOU'LL BE SHOCKED AT THE NUMBER

01:21:24.646 --> 01:21:26.448
THE SIMPLEST NUMBER TO REMEMBER

01:21:26.514 --> 01:21:28.683
THE NUMBER IS.

01:21:28.750 --> 01:21:29.584
ZERO AN UNFORTUNATE WHAT YOU

01:21:34.356 --> 01:21:34.889
THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND

01:21:34.956 --> 01:21:35.523
THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND BUT THOSE

01:21:35.590 --> 01:21:36.157
ARE THOSE ARE PEOPLE THAT HAVE

01:21:36.224 --> 01:21:37.726

THE AVERAGE BELCHES ZERO IN OUR

01:21:39.794 --> 01:21:41.363
COUNTRY.

01:21:41.429 --> 01:21:42.564
THE PERCENTAGE OF WORKERS THAT

01:21:42.631 --> 01:21:45.634
HAVE NO RETIREMENT ACCOUNT IS

01:21:45.700 --> 01:21:48.937
59% IN THIS COUNTRY.

01:21:49.004 --> 01:21:50.105
THE PERCENT OF WORKERS THAT FALL

01:21:50.171 --> 01:21:52.140
SHORT OF THE MOST CONSERVATIVE

01:21:52.207 --> 01:21:54.409
SAVINGS TARGET FOR THEIR AGE.

01:21:54.476 --> 01:21:57.712
IS 77%.

01:21:57.779 --> 01:21:59.214

SCREAMS AT CAL STIRS WOMEN ARE

01:22:01.883 --> 01:22:03.652

IN POVERTY IN RETIREMENT.

01:22:05.887 --> 01:22:07.822
THAT IS THE PICTURE WE FACE IN

01:22:07.889 --> 01:22:09.424
THIS COUNTRY AND WE HAVE TO

01:22:09.491 --> 01:22:10.625
THINK ABOUT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

01:22:10.692 --> 01:22:12.761
THIS PENSION AND THE GOOD JOB IT

01:22:12.827 --> 01:22:14.162
DOES FOR PRIMARILY THE WOMEN.

01:22:14.229 --> 01:22:16.097
BECAUSE 72% OF OUR MEMBERS ARE

01:22:16.164 --> 01:22:17.032
WOMEN.

01:22:17.098 --> 01:22:18.566
HOME PORT IN THIS IS WHEN WE GO

01:22:18.633 --> 01:22:19.801
THROUGH THESE CONTROVERSIES IN

01:22:19.868 --> 01:22:21.503
CHALLENGES AND POLITICAL

01:22:22.137 --> 01:22:23.004
THINGS.

01:22:23.071 --> 01:22:26.107
THIS ISTHAT IMPORTANT TO ALMOST

01:22:26.174 --> 01:22:26.608
ONE MILLION TEACHERS IN

01:22:26.675 --> 01:22:27.642
CALIFORNIA.

PENSION PLANS.

01:22:46.628 --> 01:22:47.595
I DID WANT TO MENTION ONE

01:22:47.662 --> 01:22:49.431
WONDERFUL STATISTIC FOR YOU

01:22:49.497 --> 01:22:51.966

OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE TO TAKE THAT

01:22:55.203 --> 01:22:56.638
INTO CONSIDERATION THE DIFFERENT

01:22:56.705 --> 01:22:57.539

INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF MONEY.

01:23:38.446 --> 01:23:40.248
THAT HAS TO BE ACQUIRED IN SOME

01:23:40.315 --> 01:23:41.850
WAY IN THESE PENSIONS TO THAT.

01:23:41.916 --> 01:23:43.284
THE EXACT NUMBER FOR WOMEN IF

CREDIBLE.

01:23:49.924 --> 01:23:51.426
AS WAS MENTIONED OUR TEACHERS DO

01:23:51.493 --> 01:23:52.360
NOT EARNED SOCIAL SECURITY

01:23:52.427 --> 01:23:54.262
CREDITS OTHER HIGHLY DEPENDENT

01:23:54.329 --> 01:23:54.963
UPON THIS SYSTEM FOR THEIR

01:23:55.029 --> 01:23:57.565
BENEFIT THEY ALSO DO NOT GET IN

01:23:57.632 --> 01:23:59.000
THIS IS OFTEN MISUNDERSTOOD.

01:23:59.067 --> 01:24:00.535
MOST OF THE TEACHERS IN

01:24:00.602 --> 01:24:02.504
CALIFORNIA GET ZERO FINANCIAL

01:24:02.570 --> 01:24:04.372
ASSISTANCE IN RETIREMENT FOR FOR

01:24:04.439 --> 01:24:05.440
HEALTH CARE.

01:24:05.507 --> 01:24:06.908
IT IS NOT LIKE STATE EMPLOYEES

01:24:06.975 --> 01:24:08.410
OR OTHER LOCAL GOVERNMENT

01:24:08.476 --> 01:24:09.577
WORKERS SO THEY MUST TAKE THAT

01:24:09.644 --> 01:24:10.979
INTO CONSIDERATION.

01:24:11.045 --> 01:24:12.347
AND THEN FINALLY I TALKED OUR

01:24:12.414 --> 01:24:14.115
TEACHERS ALL THE TIME INTO OUR

01:24:14.182 --> 01:24:15.283

THERE'S TO TAKE AWAYS FROM THAT

01:24:16.851 --> 01:24:17.485
I THINK.

01:24:17.552 --> 01:24:19.854
AGAIN WE HAVE TO HEAR THE VOICE

01:24:19.921 --> 01:24:22.557
OF THESE PEOPLE ONE THING IS

01:24:22.624 --> 01:24:24.125
THEY STILL WORRIED IS THE

01:24:24.192 --> 01:24:25.226
PENSION GOING TO BE THERE FOR

01:24:25.293 --> 01:24:26.861
THEM I STILL HEAR THAT BECAUSE

01:24:26.928 --> 01:24:28.029
THEY READ THESE NEWSPAPER

01:24:28.096 --> 01:24:30.131
STORIES ABOUT THE POLITICAL

01:24:30.198 --> 01:24:31.666

THAT PENSION GOING TO BE THERE

01:24:34.335 --> 01:24:35.336
FOR THEM AND THE SECOND THING IS

01:24:35.403 --> 01:24:37.138
THEY WANT TO TEACH THEY DON'T

01:24:37.205 --> 01:24:38.673
WANT TO BE FINANCIAL EXPERTS.

01:24:38.740 --> 01:24:39.874
THEY DON'T WANT TO UNDERSTAND

01:24:39.941 --> 01:24:41.609
HOW TO MANAGE THEIR PORTFOLIO

01:24:41.676 --> 01:24:43.311
WORD REDO ASSET ALLOCATION FOR

01:24:43.378 --> 01:24:45.880

01:24:45.947 --> 01:24:47.215
STIRS TO DO THAT FOR THEM SO.

01:24:47.282 --> 01:24:48.983
THOSE ARE TWO VERY IMPORTANT

01:24:49.050 --> 01:24:50.485
THINGS WE ARE VERY HIGH TOUCH

01:24:50.552 --> 01:24:52.320
ORGANIZATION WE ABSOLUTELY

01:24:52.387 --> 01:24:53.321
BELIEVE THAT IF YOU'RE GONNA

01:24:53.388 --> 01:24:54.756
RETIRE AND MANAGER*

01:24:54.823 --> 01:24:56.424
SUCCESSFULLY YOU CAN'T DO IT BY

01:24:56.491 --> 01:24:57.725
READING A WEB PAGE TO GET ALL

01:24:57.792 --> 01:24:59.294
THAT INFORMATION NOW WE ALL HAVE

01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:00.428
THAT WONDERFUL STUFF.

01:25:00.495 --> 01:25:02.464
ON THE WEB BUT WE HAVE A VERY

01:25:02.530 --> 01:25:04.232
EXTENSIVE COUNSELLING SYSTEM WE

COUNTER LOCAL FRONT COUNTER

01:25:16.511 --> 01:25:17.779
CONVERSATION SO THERE ARE

01:25:17.846 --> 01:25:19.914
THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS PERSON

01:25:19.981 --> 01:25:20.482
TO PERSON.

01:25:20.548 --> 01:25:22.717
SERVICE OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE DO

01:25:22.784 --> 01:25:25.253
WITH OUR MEMBERSHIP TO MAKE SURE

01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:26.421
THEY WERE TAKING CARE OF THEM.

01:25:26.488 --> 01:25:28.122
I DID WANT TO TOUCH ON THE

01:25:28.189 --> 01:25:30.291
FUNDING STATUS BECAUSE WE WERE

01:25:30.358 --> 01:25:31.626
ABSOLUTELY HEADING TOWARD

01:25:31.693 --> 01:25:33.294
INSOLVENCY BEFORE THE FUNDING

01:25:33.361 --> 01:25:36.464
BILLS PASSED IN --

01:25:36.531 --> 01:25:37.232
TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN AND THAT

01:25:37.298 --> 01:25:38.800
WAS A TERRIBLE MESSAGE FOR A

01:25:38.867 --> 01:25:39.801
YOUNG TEACHER HERE STARTING

01:25:39.868 --> 01:25:41.736
SCHOOL WHAT HOW WILL THIS HAPPEN

01:25:41.803 --> 01:25:42.203
SO.

01:25:42.270 --> 01:25:43.671
THE FUNDING BILL THAT PASSED WAS

01:25:43.738 --> 01:25:46.074
ABSOLUTELY WHAT WAS NEEDED IT'S

01:25:46.140 --> 01:25:46.941
A VERY.

01:25:47.008 --> 01:25:48.610
AS THE LA A WAS A POINTED OUT A

01:25:48.676 --> 01:25:49.511
NUMBER OF TIMES IT'S A VERY

01:25:49.577 --> 01:25:51.179
COMPLICATED FUNDING PLANNED

01:25:51.246 --> 01:25:52.547
UNDERSTAND --

01:25:52.614 --> 01:25:54.282
BUT WE DO THINK IT'S DOING THE

01:25:54.349 --> 01:25:55.783
JOB AND WHAT IT'S IN THE HOW

01:25:55.850 --> 01:25:57.185
IT'S DEVELOPED.

01:25:57.252 --> 01:25:58.786
IT PROVIDES FOR SEVEN YEARS OF

01:25:58.853 --> 01:26:00.555
INCREASE SCHOOL CONTRIBUTIONS

01:26:00.622 --> 01:26:01.990
WHICH RAISE THEIR RATES FROM

01:26:02.056 --> 01:26:04.259
EIGHT AND A QUARTER PERCENT TO

01:26:04.325 --> 01:26:05.560
NINETEEN POINT 1%.

01:26:05.627 --> 01:26:09.364
WE'RE IN YEAR FIVE OF THAT NOW

01:26:09.430 --> 01:26:11.165
THE CONCERNS RAISED AROUND THAT

01:26:11.232 --> 01:26:12.400
AND SCHOOL BUDGETS AND WE

01:26:12.467 --> 01:26:14.302
APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH THAT

01:26:14.369 --> 01:26:15.803
WAS IN FACT THE REASON WHY.

01:26:15.870 --> 01:26:17.305
THE LEGISLATION PROVIDED A RAMP

01:26:17.372 --> 01:26:21.142
UP AND WAS NOT SOME IMMEDIATE --

01:26:21.209 --> 01:26:22.777
SIGNIFICANT JUMP IN THEIR

01:26:42.897 --> 01:26:44.499
RISKS AROUND THIS IN THE WRIST

01:26:44.566 --> 01:26:46.334
ALWAYS AROUND LONG TERM

01:26:46.401 --> 01:26:48.102
INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE.

01:26:48.169 --> 01:26:48.836
THAT'S WHY THE GOVERNOR'S

01:26:48.903 --> 01:26:51.072
PROPOSAL WAS SO WELCOME TO

01:26:51.139 --> 01:26:52.707
BECAUSE AGAIN A PROVIDES JUST A

01:26:52.774 --> 01:26:54.876
BIT MORE EDGE. TO HELP ON THE

01:26:54.943 --> 01:26:57.145
FUNDING PLAN OF WHAT WE NEED AND

01:26:57.211 --> 01:27:00.949
AGAIN VERY VERY PLEASED TO SEE --

01:27:01.015 --> 01:27:01.449
THE EARLY --

01:27:01.516 --> 01:27:03.418
UP OFFERING OF THAT IN THE

01:27:03.484 --> 01:27:05.687
BUDGET PROCESS.

01:27:05.753 --> 01:27:07.522
ON THE INVESTMENT SIDE OF THE S.

01:27:07.589 --> 01:27:09.257
MARCY PUT SAID WITH CALPERS

01:27:09.324 --> 01:27:12.260
THERE IT'S 7% WE'RE AT 7%.

01:27:12.327 --> 01:27:13.828
YOU KNOW THIS NUMBERS BANDIED

01:27:13.895 --> 01:27:15.463
ABOUT LOTS OF PEOPLE HAVE

01:27:15.530 --> 01:27:17.031
OPINIONS ONTHIS INVESTMENT SOME

01:27:17.098 --> 01:27:18.733
SHOULD I WANT IT BANNED THAT FOR

01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:20.802
YOU SO WE GET.

01:27:20.868 --> 01:27:22.870
SOME SENSE OF ITS NORMALCY --

01:27:22.937 --> 01:27:26.274
LET BUSINESS OPTION SO I WENT

01:27:26.341 --> 01:27:28.509
INTO THE DATABASE FOR THE TOP

01:27:28.576 --> 01:27:29.844
ONE HUNDRED PRIVATE SECTOR

01:27:29.911 --> 01:27:31.145
PENSION FUNDS.

01:27:31.212 --> 01:27:33.014
IS SOMETIMES THIS IS CONSTRUED

01:27:33.081 --> 01:27:35.016
AS SOME PUBLIC SECTOR DRAMA

01:27:35.083 --> 01:27:36.217
AROUND THIS ASSUMPTION IF YOU

01:27:36.284 --> 01:27:38.586
TAKE THE TOP ONE HUNDRED PRIVATE

01:27:38.653 --> 01:27:39.721
SECTOR PENSION FUNDS.

01:27:39.787 --> 01:27:40.755
THEIR CURRENT INVESTMENT

01:27:40.822 --> 01:27:42.757
ASSUMPTION IS SIX POINT 8% ON

01:27:42.824 --> 01:27:44.125
AVERAGE.

01:27:44.192 --> 01:27:45.760
IF YOU TAKE THE BODY A PUBLIC

01:27:45.827 --> 01:27:47.762
PENSION PLANS IN AMERICA THEY

01:27:47.829 --> 01:27:49.197
JUST RELEASED THAT.

01:27:49.263 --> 01:27:50.598
OUR TRADE ASSOCIATION JUST

01:27:50.665 --> 01:27:51.766
RELEASED THAT STUDY THIS WEEK

01:27:51.833 --> 01:27:54.302
THAT AVERAGES ABOUT SEVEN POINT

01:27:54.369 --> 01:27:54.936
25%.

01:27:55.003 --> 01:27:57.438
SO YOU CAN KIND OF SEE THE

01:27:57.505 --> 01:27:58.640
BOOKENDS TO THAT NUMBER.

01:27:58.706 --> 01:28:00.575
AND AGAIN REMEMBER.

01:28:00.642 --> 01:28:02.377
EVEN IN THE ABSTRACT THIS NUMBER

01:28:02.443 --> 01:28:03.945
IS IT'S A PRECARIOUS THING TO

01:28:04.012 --> 01:28:04.812
COMPARE.

01:28:04.879 --> 01:28:06.547
HOW YOU INVEST YOUR MONEY WOULD

01:28:06.614 --> 01:28:07.815
PROBABLY BE DIFFERENT THAN HOW I

01:28:07.882 --> 01:28:09.584
INVEST MY MONEY SO THIS NUMBER

01:28:09.651 --> 01:28:11.252
HAS TO BE A REFLECTION?

01:28:11.319 --> 01:28:12.587
OF THE ASSET ALLOCATION AND

01:28:12.654 --> 01:28:14.389
CAN'T BE SOME NUMBER WE PULL OUT

01:28:14.455 --> 01:28:17.058
OF THIN AIR AND SAY OH IT'S 7% --

01:28:17.125 --> 01:28:19.427
NO IT'S 8% DON'T KNOW IT'S 5%.

01:28:19.494 --> 01:28:21.229
IT HAS TO STEP BE STEM BASICALLY

01:28:21.295 --> 01:28:22.864
FROM THE CONSTRUCTION OF YOUR

01:28:22.930 --> 01:28:24.866
INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO SO WILL BE

01:28:24.932 --> 01:28:25.933
GOING TO THAT EXERCISE AGAIN

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:27.435
THIS YEAR AN ASSET ALLOCATION

01:28:27.502 --> 01:28:29.003
PROCESS WITH OUR BOARD.

01:28:29.070 --> 01:28:30.138
AND AT THE END OF THE YEAR WE

01:28:30.204 --> 01:28:31.205
WILL LOOK AT THE INVESTMENT

01:28:31.272 --> 01:28:32.473
ASSUMPTION AND IN PLACE OF AN

01:28:32.540 --> 01:28:33.708
ASSUMPTION IN THE MORTALITY

01:28:33.775 --> 01:28:35.176
ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE USE IN THE

01:28:35.243 --> 01:28:37.945
PLAN WE DO THAT EVERY FOUR YEARS.

01:28:38.012 --> 01:28:39.347
TO MAKE SURE WE'RE ON TRACK.

01:28:39.414 --> 01:28:41.282
LAST COUPLE ISSUES I MENTIONED I

01:28:41.349 --> 01:28:43.017
DO WANT HAVE INVESTMENT COSTS.

01:28:43.084 --> 01:28:45.153
BECAUSE THE NUMBERS FOR SYSTEM

01:28:45.219 --> 01:28:46.654
OUR SIZE OUR CALPERS ARE.

01:28:46.721 --> 01:28:47.989
TREMENDOUS.

01:28:48.056 --> 01:28:50.825
ALL WE WERE ONE OF THREE TO

01:28:50.892 --> 01:28:52.927
DEVELOP A PUBLIC COST REPORT

01:28:52.994 --> 01:28:54.429
THAT'S ON OUR WEBSITE.

01:28:54.495 --> 01:28:57.031
THE DETAILS ACROSS EVERY ASSET

01:28:57.098 --> 01:28:58.866
CLASS NOT JUST PRIVATE EQUITY.

01:28:58.933 --> 01:29:00.768
BUT EVERY ASSET CLASSES WHAT

01:29:00.835 --> 01:29:02.670
WE'RE PAYING OUT AND FEES AS

01:29:02.737 --> 01:29:04.505
WELL WORTH WORKING LOOKING AT

01:29:04.572 --> 01:29:06.941
RIGHT NOW OF THE PORTFOLIO COSTS

01:29:07.008 --> 01:29:08.209
FEES FOR THE OUT EXTERNAL

01:29:08.276 --> 01:29:09.777
MANAGERS EXCEED A BILLION

01:29:09.844 --> 01:29:11.779
DOLLARS AND IF WE ADDED IN WHAT

01:29:11.846 --> 01:29:13.114
WE CALL CARRIED INTERESTS AND

01:29:13.181 --> 01:29:14.582
PRIVATE EQUITY THAT NUMBER GOES

01:29:14.649 --> 01:29:16.150
TO A ONE POINT. EIGHT BILLION

01:29:16.217 --> 01:29:17.719
DOLLARS.

01:29:17.785 --> 01:29:19.253
SO IT'S A LOT OF MONEY THAT WE

01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:21.155
HAVE TO SPEND TO MANAGE TWO

01:29:21.222 --> 01:29:24.258
HUNDRED TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS.

01:29:24.325 --> 01:29:26.027
97% OF ALL OF OUR PORTFOLIO

01:29:26.094 --> 01:29:28.129
COSTS ARE WITH THOSE EXTERNAL

01:29:28.196 --> 01:29:32.400
MANAGERS SO 97%. 3% OF THE COSTS

01:29:32.467 --> 01:29:34.001
ARE FOR OUR STAFF.

01:29:34.068 --> 01:29:36.404
YET THEY ONLY MANAGE 56% OF THE

01:29:36.471 --> 01:29:38.306
ASSETS I WANNA MAKE SURE YOU SEE

01:29:38.372 --> 01:29:38.840
THAT.

01:29:38.906 --> 01:29:40.007
THAT CONCEPTUAL CONTRADICTION

01:29:40.074 --> 01:29:41.476
THERE.

01:29:41.542 --> 01:29:43.978
SO OUR OWN STAFF IS MANAGING 44%

01:29:44.045 --> 01:29:45.880
OF THE ASSETS.

01:29:45.947 --> 01:29:47.381
BUT TAKING UP ONLY 3% OF THE

01:29:47.448 --> 01:29:48.549
COST.

01:29:48.616 --> 01:29:50.017
THAT'S THE COST EQUATION WE

01:29:50.084 --> 01:29:51.853
GOTTA START STRUGGLING WITH ALL

01:29:51.919 --> 01:29:53.321
OF US IN RECOGNIZE.

01:29:53.387 --> 01:29:54.555
THE EASIEST WAY TO MAKE MONEY

01:29:54.622 --> 01:29:56.624
HERE IS NOT MAKING BEST BETS ON

01:29:56.691 --> 01:29:57.959
THE MARKET IS SAVING ON FEES

01:29:58.025 --> 01:29:59.727
ALWAYS I MEAN WE SHOULD DO THAT

01:29:59.794 --> 01:30:01.129
OUR PERSONAL LIFE YOU SHOULD

01:30:01.195 --> 01:30:02.363
ALWAYS LOOK FIRST TO FEES.

01:30:02.430 --> 01:30:04.665
THAT IS WHERE THE SWEET SPOT

01:30:04.732 --> 01:30:06.400
HERE IS FOR CHANGE FOR ALL OF US.

01:30:06.467 --> 01:30:07.835
NOW I WOULD NEVER SAY TO YOU

01:30:07.902 --> 01:30:08.970
WE'RE GOING TO BE EXPERTS HERE

01:30:09.036 --> 01:30:10.404
IN PICKING A PRIVATE EQUITY

01:30:10.471 --> 01:30:11.939
INVESTMENT IN CHINA.

01:30:12.006 --> 01:30:13.474
BUT THERE'S A LOT MORE WE CAN DO

01:30:13.541 --> 01:30:14.742
DIFFERENTLY AND THAT'S WHAT OUR

01:30:14.809 --> 01:30:16.310
BOARD IN OUR BEST AND STAFF FOR

01:30:16.377 --> 01:30:18.346
PURSUING NOW IS HOW COULD WE

01:30:18.412 --> 01:30:19.881
PUSH IT THIS MODEL.

01:30:19.947 --> 01:30:21.048
AND THINK DIFFERENTLY.

01:30:21.115 --> 01:30:24.085
THERE IS A LEGEND BACK TO YOU

01:30:24.152 --> 01:30:26.254
WITH THIS TO THE MORE WE PUSH ON

01:30:26.320 --> 01:30:27.889
THAT MODEL THE MORE WE THINK

01:30:27.955 --> 01:30:29.190
MORE.

01:30:29.257 --> 01:30:31.292
LIKE A PRIVATE SECTOR ENTITY.

01:30:31.359 --> 01:30:32.727
CAN WE SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE THIS

01:30:32.794 --> 01:30:34.929
WELL WITH SOME OF THE GOVERNMENT

01:30:34.996 --> 01:30:36.397
APPARATUS AROUND US.

01:30:36.464 --> 01:30:38.199
THERE ARE MANY PURCHASING HUMAN

01:30:38.266 --> 01:30:40.468
RESOURCE ISSUES THAT SURROUND

01:30:40.535 --> 01:30:42.203
WORKING IN STATE GOVERNMENT AND

01:30:42.270 --> 01:30:43.371
THERE WAS MAY NOT ALWAYS FIT A

01:30:43.437 --> 01:30:44.872
COMMERCIAL MODEL AND THOSE ARE

01:30:44.939 --> 01:30:46.474
THINGS WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT

01:30:46.541 --> 01:30:48.876
BECAUSE YOU CAN SEE. FOR EVERY

01:30:48.943 --> 01:30:50.545
TEN DOLLARS I PAY X. Y. Z. ON

01:30:50.611 --> 01:30:51.979
WALL STREET I'M GONNA PAY ONE

01:30:52.046 --> 01:30:53.514
DOLLAR.

01:30:53.581 --> 01:30:54.949
DO CAL STIRS EMPLOY SO IF WE CAN

01:30:55.016 --> 01:30:57.084
PUSH ON THAT SUCCESSFULLY IN IT

01:30:57.151 --> 01:30:58.753
IS THE BE ALL OF IT YOU CAN SAY

01:30:58.820 --> 01:31:00.454
POTENTIALLY HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS

01:31:00.521 --> 01:31:01.756
OF DOLLARS HERE.

01:31:01.823 --> 01:31:03.124
IN THIS EQUATION.

01:31:03.191 --> 01:31:04.859
LAST POINT ON DIVEST BUT IF I

01:31:04.926 --> 01:31:06.694
COULD RESTATEMENT THAT IT'S

01:31:06.761 --> 01:31:08.095
WITHOUT THAT WAS GOING TO BE MY

01:31:08.162 --> 01:31:08.896
QUESTION YEAH THAT --

01:31:08.963 --> 01:31:11.499
MISTER O'DONNELL REYES DID AND I

01:31:11.566 --> 01:31:13.000
WANT TO SAY THE OLDER MAN DID I

01:31:13.067 --> 01:31:14.535
I THINK WE ALL SHOULD LOOK HERE

01:31:14.602 --> 01:31:16.337
THIS LEARN IT AND HOPEFULLY

01:31:16.404 --> 01:31:17.805
THOSE ARE WATCHING.

01:31:17.872 --> 01:31:19.740
OF CAN UNDERSTAND IT IS WELL IT

01:31:19.807 --> 01:31:20.541
AND I WANNA I WANNA SETTLE

01:31:20.608 --> 01:31:21.809
DIFFERENTLY THAT'S BEEN CHAD

01:31:21.876 --> 01:31:23.544
ABOUT SO FAR TODAY IT IS I'D

01:31:23.611 --> 01:31:24.946
LOOK AT INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO

01:31:25.012 --> 01:31:26.814
THIS IS A GLOBALLY DIVERSE

01:31:26.881 --> 01:31:28.382
PORTFOLIO ACROSS THE ENTIRE

01:31:28.449 --> 01:31:29.050
WORLD.

01:31:29.116 --> 01:31:34.155
IN EVERY INDUSTRY SECTOR.

01:31:34.222 --> 01:31:34.655
THERE IS WE HAVE TO BE

01:31:34.722 --> 01:31:35.623
RECOGNIZED FOR SOMETHING BAD

01:31:35.690 --> 01:31:37.525
GOING ON ALWAYS SOMEWHERE IN

01:31:37.592 --> 01:31:38.659
BUSINESS.

01:31:38.726 --> 01:31:40.194
WHETHER IT'S A DAMN THAT BREAKS

01:31:40.261 --> 01:31:41.462
OF BRAZIL.

01:31:41.529 --> 01:31:42.897
A PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCT THAT

01:31:42.964 --> 01:31:44.432
TURNS OUT TO BE DANGEROUS CHILD

01:31:44.498 --> 01:31:46.767
LABOR TO MAKE A CLOTHING PRODUCT.

01:31:46.834 --> 01:31:50.905
OF COAL.

01:31:50.972 --> 01:31:52.607
EMISSIONS THESE ARE RISKS THE

01:31:52.673 --> 01:31:55.343
PERVADE THE ENTIRE PORTFOLIO.

01:31:55.409 --> 01:31:57.478
SO WE CAN'T LOOK AT THIS

01:31:57.545 --> 01:31:58.679
HAPHAZARDLY AND SAY MY GOSH

01:31:58.746 --> 01:32:00.214
HERE'S AN ISSUE CERTAINLY LET'S

01:32:00.281 --> 01:32:01.249
JUMP ON THIS ISSUE.

01:32:01.315 --> 01:32:02.583
AND AND TAKE THAT OUT OF THE

01:32:02.650 --> 01:32:06.020
PORTFOLIO IF BE NOTHING LEFT IF

01:32:06.087 --> 01:32:07.121
WE LOOK AT RISK AND AGAIN I'M

01:32:07.188 --> 01:32:08.456
GONNA GOT MY INSURANCE.

01:32:08.522 --> 01:32:10.258
MINDSET ON THIS BECAUSE RISK PER

01:32:10.324 --> 01:32:13.160
FADES ALL THE PORTFOLIO THIS IS

01:32:13.227 --> 01:32:14.929
ABOUT HOW TO MANAGE THAT RISK

01:32:14.996 --> 01:32:16.664
AND HOW TO DO THAT INTELLIGENTLY.

01:32:16.731 --> 01:32:18.466
SO THERE THERE ARE ISSUES AT

01:32:18.532 --> 01:32:20.201
TIMES THAT DESERVE THAT LEVEL OF

01:32:20.268 --> 01:32:22.003
ANALYSIS WHETHER AT WELL WITH

01:32:22.069 --> 01:32:24.305
THEIR SERVICING THE PORTFOLIO

01:32:24.372 --> 01:32:26.007
WELL AND BRINGING VALUE.

01:32:26.073 --> 01:32:27.508
AND THEN WHAT TO DO WITH IT.

01:32:27.575 --> 01:32:29.844
SO WE AND AND AS AS CALPERS WE

01:32:29.911 --> 01:32:31.245
HAVE EXTENSIVE STAFF NOW THAT

01:32:31.312 --> 01:32:33.481
OUR ENGAGEMENT BASED EMPLOYEES.

01:32:33.547 --> 01:32:35.082
THAT REALLY ARE USING THOSE

01:32:35.149 --> 01:32:37.518
TECHNIQUES TO ENGAGE A COMPANY

01:32:37.585 --> 01:32:38.819
AND DISCUSSED BUSINESS STRATEGY

01:32:38.886 --> 01:32:40.621
AROUND THOSE ISSUES WHETHER IT'S

01:32:40.688 --> 01:32:43.391
SAFE WORKING PRACTICES WORKING

01:32:43.457 --> 01:32:44.926
CONDITIONS LABOR PRACTICES --

01:32:44.992 --> 01:32:46.527
DIVERSITY ON A BOARD IS A HUGE

01:32:46.594 --> 01:32:48.496
ISSUE RIGHT NOW --

01:32:48.562 --> 01:32:50.197
THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT

01:32:50.264 --> 01:32:51.565
COULDN'T WHERE WE CAN MAKE A

01:32:51.632 --> 01:32:53.034
DIFFERENCE AND WE'VE GOT A TRACK

01:32:53.100 --> 01:32:54.502
RECORD DOING IT AND WE PROVIDE A

01:32:54.568 --> 01:32:56.137
SMALL HAND OUT IN YOUR FOLDER

01:32:56.203 --> 01:32:57.738
AROUND AS OF THE VARIOUS

01:32:57.805 --> 01:32:58.706
ENGAGEMENTS THAT WE HAVE GOING

01:32:58.773 --> 01:33:00.675
ON WHERE WE HAVE IN FACT MOVE

01:33:00.741 --> 01:33:01.409
THE BALL FOR THIS.

01:33:01.475 --> 01:33:02.543
ISN'T JUST ABOUT LOVE WRITING A

01:33:02.610 --> 01:33:04.078
LETTER TO ACCOMPANY THIS IS

01:33:04.145 --> 01:33:05.146
ACTUALLY SITTING DOWN WITH

01:38:48.622 --> 01:38:49.957
THOUGH BETWEEN THE COUNTY

01:38:50.024 --> 01:38:51.992
SYSTEMS AND THIS BIG STATEWIDE

01:38:52.059 --> 01:38:54.228
SYSTEMS IS THAT WE THE EACH

01:38:54.295 --> 01:38:55.929
SYSTEM IS REALLY THE IS IT'S

01:38:55.996 --> 01:38:57.164
IT'S THE ON THE GOVERNANCE

01:38:57.231 --> 01:38:58.766
STRUCTURE SO EACH SYSTEM HAS A

01:38:58.832 --> 01:39:00.334
LOCAL RETIREMENT BOARD.

01:39:00.401 --> 01:39:03.537
AND WE DON'T HAVE ONE RETIREMENT

01:39:03.604 --> 01:39:05.539
FOR THE A TWENTY INDEPENDENT

01:39:05.606 --> 01:39:06.607
RETIREMENT BOARD'S.

01:39:06.674 --> 01:39:07.708
LIMIT ABOVE ELECTED EMPLOYEES A

01:39:07.775 --> 01:39:09.743
RETIREE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS

01:39:09.810 --> 01:39:11.645
APPOINTEES AND THE COUNTY

01:39:11.712 --> 01:39:12.813
TREASURER.

01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:14.214
AND LOCAL CONTROL --

01:39:14.281 --> 01:39:15.182
MEANS LOCAL ACCOUNTABILITY --

01:39:15.249 --> 01:39:16.684
PLAN MEMBERS THE STAKEHOLDERS

01:39:16.750 --> 01:39:19.253
HAVE A LOT OF A LOT MORE ACCESS

01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:21.322
TO ON TO US.

01:39:21.388 --> 01:39:21.789
AND I THINK A STRONGER

01:39:21.855 --> 01:39:22.589
RELATIONSHIP.

01:39:22.656 --> 01:39:24.625
TO THE THE BIGGEST THAT PART ONE

01:39:24.692 --> 01:39:25.292
OF THE BIGGER DIFFERENCE IS ALSO

01:39:25.359 --> 01:39:26.160
IS THAT --

01:39:26.226 --> 01:39:35.102
SO CALPERS HAS THREE THOUSAND

01:39:35.169 --> 01:39:37.404
EMPLOYERS SAID ROUGHLY --

01:39:37.471 --> 01:39:38.906
INTO A THIRD THE STATE A THIRD

01:39:38.972 --> 01:39:40.040
SO SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN A THIRD --

01:39:40.107 --> 01:39:40.974
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND THE COUNTY

01:39:41.041 --> 01:39:41.942
SYSTEMS THE COUNTY IS THE

01:39:42.009 --> 01:39:43.410
DOMINANT MAIN EMPLOYER --

01:39:43.477 --> 01:39:44.411
IT'S USUALLY ABOUT 90% OF THE

01:39:44.478 --> 01:39:45.179
ENTIRE MEMBERSHIP.

01:39:45.245 --> 01:39:45.779
OR MORE SO WE HAVE A REALLY

01:39:45.846 --> 01:39:47.214
REALLY CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH --

01:39:47.281 --> 01:39:48.749
WITH THE COUNTY.

01:39:48.816 --> 01:39:55.356
AND WHAT WE HAVE SORT OF A LOWER

01:39:55.422 --> 01:39:55.923
PROFILE IN THE BIG STATES

01:39:55.989 --> 01:39:57.224
SYSTEMS WE DO AS STRIVE TO BE A

01:39:57.291 --> 01:39:58.359
GOOD RESOURCE FOR STAKEHOLDERS

01:39:58.425 --> 01:39:59.193
IN THE LEGISLATURE SERVICE AN

01:39:59.259 --> 01:40:00.194

01:40:07.534 --> 01:40:08.736
WHAT'S THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE

01:40:08.802 --> 01:40:09.670
TODAY FACING THE THIRTY SEVEN

01:40:09.737 --> 01:40:10.137

01:40:11.305 --> 01:40:12.439
SYSTEMS.

01:40:12.506 --> 01:40:14.208
I THINK THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE

01:40:14.274 --> 01:40:16.076
TODAY IS REALLY --

01:40:16.143 --> 01:40:23.350
THE TRANSITION TO FOR A IN

01:40:23.417 --> 01:40:23.951

WATCHING REALLY CLOSELY.

01:40:30.157 --> 01:40:31.325
SO -- IN THE

01:40:31.392 --> 01:40:33.127
COUNTY AND THE COUNTY WORLD.

01:40:33.193 --> 01:40:36.630
WE BASED ON A LONG HISTORY OF OF

01:40:36.697 --> 01:40:38.098
COURT DECISIONS AND AND

01:40:38.165 --> 01:40:40.768
SETTLEMENTS OF AGE COUNTY SYSTEM.

01:40:40.834 --> 01:40:42.803
TO CRAFTED THEIR OWN SET OF

01:40:42.870 --> 01:40:44.271
RULES ABOUT WHAT COUNTS TOWARDS

01:40:44.338 --> 01:40:46.206
COMPENSATION --

01:40:46.273 --> 01:40:47.341
THEY CAN BE USED TO CALCULATE

01:40:47.408 --> 01:40:48.675
YOUR PENSION BENEFITS FOR THESE

01:40:48.742 --> 01:40:50.344
LEGACY MEMBERS.

01:40:50.411 --> 01:40:52.846
AND TAPPARA ESTABLISHED --

01:40:52.913 --> 01:40:54.348
A LOT STRICTER RULES ABOUT THAT

01:40:54.415 --> 01:40:56.417
ON A AND A MUCH TIGHTER STANDARD

01:40:56.483 --> 01:40:58.018
AND ALSO GAVE DIRECTION TO THE

01:40:58.085 --> 01:41:00.554
KIND RETIREMENT SYSTEMS --

01:41:00.621 --> 01:41:01.989
TO TO GO BACK AND MAKE SURE THAT

01:41:02.055 --> 01:41:03.857
NO ONE WAS IN AN APPROPRIATELY

01:41:03.924 --> 01:41:05.292
ENHANCING PENSION BENEFITS.

01:41:05.359 --> 01:41:06.994
AND WHAT THAT MEANS REALLY KIND

01:41:07.060 --> 01:41:09.696
OF OPENS A PANDORA'S BOX OF WHAT

01:41:09.763 --> 01:41:11.398
LITTLE NUANCES OF YOUR

AND THAT GETS VERY HOT LEGALLY

01:41:15.702 --> 01:41:17.805
AND WE HAVE A LOT OF CASES THAT.

01:41:17.871 --> 01:41:20.107
HAVE --

01:41:20.174 --> 01:41:21.408
SINCE TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN OF I

01:41:21.475 --> 01:41:25.179
THINK IT'S PRO BIGGEST ISSUES OF

01:41:25.245 --> 01:41:26.580
IF THE COURT GIVES US DIRECTION

01:41:26.647 --> 01:41:29.149
HOW WE ON WINE SOME OF THOSE OR

01:41:29.216 --> 01:41:30.751
WHERE WE KIND OF GOT MOVED GOING

01:41:30.818 --> 01:41:32.886
FORWARD AND WHAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:41:32.953 --> 01:41:33.554
MIGHT BE CONFRONTED WITH AT THAT

01:41:33.620 --> 01:41:35.255
POINT.

01:41:35.322 --> 01:41:36.356
TWO INTERESTED IN IS MISTER

INDEPENDENT RETIREMENT SYSTEMS

01:41:42.362 --> 01:41:43.330
WE TALKED ABOUT THE RATE OF

01:41:43.397 --> 01:41:44.798
RETURN OR THE RETURN THAT WE'RE

01:41:44.865 --> 01:41:47.568
GETTING FROM THE LARGER SYSTEMS

01:41:47.634 --> 01:41:51.071
OR IS THERE A OF WHICH THE RANGE

01:41:51.138 --> 01:41:52.372
THAT SURE YEAH YET SO IT SO

01:41:52.439 --> 01:41:53.006
BECAUSE THERE'S TWENTY SYSTEMS

01:41:53.073 --> 01:41:53.907
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A LITTLE BIT.

01:41:53.974 --> 01:41:54.641
OF DEVIATION --

01:41:54.708 --> 01:41:57.644
I WOULD SAY GENERALLY THE THE

01:41:57.711 --> 01:41:58.745
ASSUME RIGHT OF RETURN FOR MOUSE

01:41:58.812 --> 01:42:01.215
THE SYSTEMS IS ABOUT 7% BUT IT

01:42:01.281 --> 01:42:02.783
CAN RANGE ON SAM CEREBUS US A

01:42:02.850 --> 01:42:04.451
MATTEO --

01:42:04.518 --> 01:42:05.018
COUNTY EMPLOYEES RETIREMENT

01:42:06.653 --> 01:42:09.389
POINT 75% INVESTMENT ASSUMPTION

01:42:09.456 --> 01:42:11.291
BUT SOME SYSTEMS ARE STILL ABOUT

01:42:11.358 --> 01:42:12.526
SEVEN A QUARTER BUT THEY'RE ALL

01:42:12.593 --> 01:42:14.461
TRENDING TRENDING DOWN BECAUSE

01:42:14.528 --> 01:42:17.331

01:42:24.805 --> 01:42:26.006
OF A MAYBE A LAG BUT I THINK

01:42:26.073 --> 01:42:27.407
YOU'RE SAYING EVERYONE COME DOWN

01:42:27.474 --> 01:42:29.009

OF PUSHING DOWN THE THE OVERALL

01:42:46.159 --> 01:42:47.394
ASSUMPTION RIGHT OR THAT THOSE

01:42:47.461 --> 01:42:48.695
THAT ARE ACTUALLY GETTING A RATE

01:42:48.762 --> 01:42:51.265
OF RETURN IT'S MUCH LOWER THAN

01:42:51.331 --> 01:42:53.534
THAT OR MUCH HIGHER.

EDGE AND JUST --

02:02:49.628 --> 02:02:50.963
ONE TO REITERATE THE POINTS ON

02:02:51.030 --> 02:02:51.964
DIVEST MEANT THAT THAT

02:02:52.031 --> 02:02:54.100
SIGNIFICANT WHEN IT COMES TO THE

02:02:54.166 --> 02:02:55.768
DISCOUNT RATE --

02:02:55.835 --> 02:02:57.870
IT IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR US THAT

02:02:57.937 --> 02:02:59.271
THE DISCOUNT RATE IS ACCURATE.

02:02:59.338 --> 02:03:01.640
THAT IT NOT BE ARBITRARILY SET

02:03:01.707 --> 02:03:04.276
AT A HIGHER LEVEL TO SAVE OUR

02:03:04.343 --> 02:03:06.078

02:03:06.145 --> 02:03:08.080
WHAT HAPPENS IF THE DISCOUNT

FUNDED LIABILITY GOES UP AND

02:03:11.717 --> 02:03:13.819
THAT THAT THE TOTAL COST OF THAT

02:03:13.886 --> 02:03:15.488
UNFUNDED LIABILITY AT THIS TIME

02:03:15.554 --> 02:03:17.022
IS BORED BY THE EMPLOYER.

02:03:17.089 --> 02:03:19.959
SO IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US THAT

02:03:20.025 --> 02:03:22.495
THAT AT THAT NUMBER WE'RE FACING

02:03:22.561 --> 02:03:23.829
A LOT OF CHALLENGES WITH WITH

RETIREMENT AS IT RELATES TO

02:07:24.903 --> 02:07:26.505
EDUCATORS --

02:07:29.475 --> 02:07:30.943
THAT CHECKING IS WITHOUT CAL

02:07:31.010 --> 02:07:33.579
STAR HEAD IS NOTED THAT 72% OF

CALPERS MEMBERS ARE WOMEN SO

02:07:35.247 --> 02:07:36.982
THIS IS A WOMEN'S ISSUE IN THAT

02:07:37.049 --> 02:07:38.450
OFTEN GETS LEFT OUT OF THE

02:07:38.517 --> 02:07:39.918
DISCUSSION AS WE TALK ABOUT

02:07:39.985 --> 02:07:41.420
DOLLARS AND CENTS IT'S A VERY

02:07:41.487 --> 02:07:42.488
IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:07:42.554 --> 02:07:43.889
WE'RE PUTTING UP PHASE SO.

02:07:43.956 --> 02:07:45.357
WE CAN ACCURATELY REFLECT THE

02:07:45.424 --> 02:07:46.658
MYRIAD OF ISSUES THAT ARE

02:07:46.725 --> 02:07:48.794
MEMBERS FACE IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT

02:07:48.861 --> 02:07:49.561
TO KNOW --

02:07:49.628 --> 02:07:50.929
THAT IS A JACKET SAID

02:07:50.996 --> 02:07:52.931
ADDITIONALLY OUT MOST REMEMBERS

02:07:52.998 --> 02:07:54.666
DON'T HAVE RETIREE HEALTH AFTER

02:07:54.733 --> 02:07:56.735
EACH SIXTY FIVE SO WHEN THE

02:07:56.802 --> 02:07:59.171
REPLACEMENT RATIO WHICH IS THE

02:07:59.238 --> 02:08:00.906
THAT TOTAL DOLLARS THAT OUR

02:08:00.973 --> 02:08:01.874
MEMBERS ARE GETTING FOR THEIR

02:08:01.940 --> 02:08:04.176
CAL STIRS BENEFIT OVERALL.

02:08:04.243 --> 02:08:06.178
MAY NOT BE ENOUGH TO COVER THE

02:08:06.245 --> 02:08:07.379
TOTAL COSTS IF THEY'RE GONNA

02:08:07.446 --> 02:08:09.415
HAVE AS A RETIREE AND COUPLED

02:08:09.481 --> 02:08:10.482
WITH THE FACT THAT THEY'RE

02:08:10.549 --> 02:08:12.184
LIVING LONGER WHICH MEANS IF

02:08:12.251 --> 02:08:13.752
THEY'RE CAL STIRS BENEFIT.

02:08:13.819 --> 02:08:16.655
IS THE PRIMARY MECHANISM THAT'S

02:08:16.722 --> 02:08:18.057
GOING TO BE THE DIFFERENCE

02:08:18.123 --> 02:08:19.925
BETWEEN HAVING A SECURE

02:08:19.992 --> 02:08:21.760
RETIREMENT FUTURE AND LIVING IN

02:08:21.827 --> 02:08:22.861
POVERTY.

02:08:22.928 --> 02:08:24.963
IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT

02:08:25.030 --> 02:08:26.598
OUR MEMBERS SINCE THEY'RE

02:08:26.665 --> 02:08:28.133
PRIMARILY WOMEN HAVE

02:08:28.200 --> 02:08:29.802
DISPROPORTIONATELY A LOWER

02:08:29.868 --> 02:08:31.170
AMOUNT OF SERVICE CREDIT THAN

02:08:31.236 --> 02:08:34.440
THEIR MALE COUNTERPARTS BECAUSE

02:08:34.506 --> 02:08:36.241
CHILDREN. TO CARE FOR OTHER

02:08:36.308 --> 02:08:37.543
FAMILY MEMBERS.

02:08:37.609 --> 02:08:39.144
ALL OF THIS HELPS THE PAIN TO

02:08:39.211 --> 02:08:41.513
REAP A PICTURE SPECIALLY NOTING

02:08:41.580 --> 02:08:42.748
THAT OUR MEMBERS DON'T GET

02:08:42.815 --> 02:08:44.983
SOCIAL SECURITY AND WE'VE MADE

02:08:45.050 --> 02:08:46.852
IT A POINT AS A STATE FOR A FEW

02:08:46.919 --> 02:08:49.021
DECADES NOW TO RECRUIT EDUCATORS

02:08:49.088 --> 02:08:50.956
AS A SECOND CAREER. TO BRING

02:08:51.023 --> 02:08:52.758
PEOPLE IN TO TEACH MATH SCIENCE

02:08:52.825 --> 02:08:55.360
A NUMBER OF OTHER ISSUES WITHOUT

02:08:55.427 --> 02:08:56.929
HELPING THEM TO UNDERSTAND THAT

02:08:56.995 --> 02:08:58.263
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S WAY OF

02:08:58.330 --> 02:09:00.232
THINKING THEM IS TO REDUCE OR

02:09:00.299 --> 02:09:01.600
ELIMINATE THE SOCIAL SECURITY

02:09:01.667 --> 02:09:03.302
BENEFITS THAT THEY HAD ACTUALLY

02:09:03.368 --> 02:09:09.374
PAID INTO. TO THEIR OTHER CAREER

02:09:09.441 --> 02:09:12.711
SO THIS APPRECIATIVE OF THE FACT

02:09:12.778 --> 02:09:14.813
THAT GOVERNOR NEW SIM CONTINUES

02:09:14.880 --> 02:09:16.348
TO BELIEVE RETIREMENT SECURITY

02:09:16.415 --> 02:09:18.417
IS IMPORTANT MORE APPRECIATIVE

02:09:18.484 --> 02:09:19.952
OF THE RESOURCES THAT HE'S

02:09:20.018 --> 02:09:21.553
PROVIDING THAT CERTAINLY GOING

02:09:21.620 --> 02:09:23.555
TO BE HELPFUL FOR OUR MEMBERS AS

02:09:23.622 --> 02:09:25.557
WELL AS FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS --

02:09:25.624 --> 02:09:27.926
WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT --

02:09:27.993 --> 02:09:29.995
THAT RETIREMENT SECURITY IS THE

02:09:30.062 --> 02:09:32.698
KEY BECAUSE FOR OUR MEMBERS

02:09:32.764 --> 02:09:33.599
THAT'S GOING TO BE THE

02:09:33.665 --> 02:09:35.167
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THAT AND

02:09:35.234 --> 02:09:37.136
POVERTY WE ALSO NEED TO NOTE

02:09:37.202 --> 02:09:39.204
THAT EDUCATION IS REALLY TAKEN A

02:09:39.271 --> 02:09:40.739
SIGNIFICANT HITS.

02:09:40.806 --> 02:09:42.174
SO DURING THE RECESSION --

02:09:42.241 --> 02:09:44.343
PROP NINETY EIGHT HAD SIXTY FIVE

02:09:44.409 --> 02:09:46.812
BILLION DOLLARS ELIMINATED --

02:09:46.879 --> 02:09:48.347
ESSENTIALLY FUNDS THAT WERE

02:09:48.413 --> 02:09:50.015
REDUCE DURING THE RECESSION THAT

02:09:50.082 --> 02:09:51.650
WE DID NOT GET PAID BACK FOR AS

02:09:51.717 --> 02:09:53.185
OTHER ENTITIES WHEN THEY HAD

02:09:53.252 --> 02:09:55.687
MONEY THAT WAS I USE.

02:09:55.754 --> 02:09:57.256
THEY RECEIVE THOSE MONIES BACK

02:09:57.322 --> 02:09:59.124
WITH INTEREST EDUCATION DIDN'T

02:09:59.191 --> 02:10:00.526
SEE THAT WHICH MEANS THAT THE

02:10:00.592 --> 02:10:02.427
RECESSION LEFTA WHOLE

02:10:02.494 --> 02:10:05.464
GENERATION OF OUR MEMBERS HAVING

02:10:05.531 --> 02:10:06.698
FURLOUGHS.

HAVE BEEN STALLED IN FLAT SALARY

02:10:09.101 --> 02:10:11.069
RATES FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS

02:10:11.136 --> 02:10:12.337
THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY

02:10:12.404 --> 02:10:14.039
YOU'RE SEEING A LOT OF HOT SPOTS

02:10:14.106 --> 02:10:15.641
AROUND THE TWO ON AROUND THE

02:10:15.707 --> 02:10:16.375
STATE.

02:10:16.441 --> 02:10:17.509
YOU THERE'S A LOT OF FOLKS THAT

02:10:17.576 --> 02:10:19.077

02:10:19.144 --> 02:10:22.214
TIME TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE --

02:10:22.281 --> 02:10:23.715
AN ADEQUATE FUNDING FOR

02:10:23.782 --> 02:10:25.317
EDUCATION WERE NOT EVEN

02:10:25.384 --> 02:10:26.919
PROVIDING THAT SO THAT ALSO

02:10:26.985 --> 02:10:28.554
REFLECTS INTO THE SALARIES THAT

02:10:28.620 --> 02:10:30.189
OUR MEMBERS MAKE WHICH MEANS

02:10:30.255 --> 02:10:31.056
IT'S GOING TO HAVE A LONG TERM

02:10:31.123 --> 02:10:31.990
IMPACT.

02:10:32.057 --> 02:10:33.425
ON THE TOTAL PENSION THAT

GOING TO HAVE BUT THE LONG TERM

02:10:52.311 --> 02:10:53.912

SO RETIREMENT SECURITY OPPONENTS

02:13:13.752 --> 02:13:14.953
HAVE BEEN ALSO WARNING FOR THE

02:13:15.020 --> 02:13:16.288
PAST TWENTY YEARS THAT THERE'S A

02:13:16.355 --> 02:13:17.923
PENSION CRISIS DUE TO UNFUNDED

02:13:17.989 --> 02:13:19.424
LIABILITIES HE TALKED ABOUT THAT

02:13:19.491 --> 02:13:20.125
TODAY.

02:13:20.192 --> 02:13:21.860
THE REALITY IS IS THAT UNFUNDED

02:13:21.927 --> 02:13:24.229
LIABILITIES OF ALWAYS FLUCTUATED

02:13:24.296 --> 02:13:25.630
OVER THE PAST SEVENTY FIVE YEARS

02:13:25.697 --> 02:13:26.365
THERE HAVE BEEN PERIODS WHERE

02:13:26.431 --> 02:13:27.532
UNFUNDED LIABILITIES HAVE BEEN

02:13:27.599 --> 02:13:30.402
FAR WORSE.

02:13:30.469 --> 02:13:31.503
AND FAR BETTER THAN TODAY.

02:13:31.570 --> 02:13:32.137
THERE WAS A TIME WHEN PENSION

02:13:32.204 --> 02:13:34.239
FUNDS WERE UNDER 50% FUNDED AND

02:13:34.306 --> 02:13:35.240
IN THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS

02:13:35.307 --> 02:13:37.843
PENSIONS WERE OVER 1100% FUNDED

02:13:37.909 --> 02:13:39.244
AS WAS NOTED SUPER FUNDED.

02:13:39.311 --> 02:13:40.779
IN THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS MOST

02:13:40.846 --> 02:13:43.415
PENSIONS WERE OVER A 100% FUNDED.

02:13:43.482 --> 02:13:44.950
AND THE LOWER FUNDED STATUS

02:13:45.016 --> 02:13:47.219
TODAY IS NOT THE FAULT OF PUBLIC

02:13:47.285 --> 02:13:48.787
EMPLOYEES AND BENEFITS IT WAS

02:13:48.854 --> 02:13:50.322
CAUSED BY WALL STREET REAL

02:13:50.389 --> 02:13:52.090
ESTATE ABUSES WHICH WOULD TO

02:13:52.157 --> 02:13:53.892
WEAR THAT DEREGULATE DERIVATIVES

02:13:53.959 --> 02:13:54.960
TRIGGERED --

02:13:55.026 --> 02:13:56.828
THE THE GREAT RECESSION STILL

02:13:56.895 --> 02:13:58.797
THE DOOMSDAY PREDICTIONS OF THE

02:13:58.864 --> 02:14:00.766
ANTI PENSION ZEALOTS OF THAT

02:14:00.832 --> 02:14:02.167
THEY'VE MADE YEAR AFTER YEAR FOR

02:14:02.234 --> 02:14:03.368
THE LAST TWENTY YEARS HAVE NOT

02:14:03.435 --> 02:14:04.603
COME TRUE.

02:14:04.669 --> 02:14:05.704
SINCE THE GREAT RECESSION

02:14:05.771 --> 02:14:10.242
UNFUNDED LIVE 580% WHICH IS FAR

02:14:10.308 --> 02:14:12.244
ABOVE THE LEVELS OF FUNDED

02:14:12.310 --> 02:14:13.578
STATUS IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES

02:14:13.645 --> 02:14:15.147
AND EARLIER AND IN ADDITION THE

02:14:15.213 --> 02:14:16.448
PERCENTAGE OF THE STATE BUDGET

02:14:16.515 --> 02:14:18.116
DEDICATED TO PENSIONS.

02:14:18.183 --> 02:14:19.451
HAS ACTUALLY GONE DOWN IT'S

02:14:19.518 --> 02:14:21.319
LOWER TODAY THAN IT HAS BEEN FOR

02:14:21.386 --> 02:14:22.754
THE PAST DECADE.

02:14:22.821 --> 02:14:24.122
SO THE RETIREMENT SECURITY

02:14:24.189 --> 02:14:25.791
OPPONENTS THEN TELL US THAT THE

02:14:25.857 --> 02:14:26.892
SOLUTION IS TO ELIMINATE DOUBT

02:14:26.958 --> 02:14:28.660
DEFINED BENEFIT PENSIONS AND PUT

02:14:28.727 --> 02:14:29.995
EVERYBODY IN A RISKY FOR ONE

02:14:30.061 --> 02:14:31.329
CASE DOUBT PLAN.

02:14:31.396 --> 02:14:32.964
WHAT THEY DON'T TELL YOU IS THAT

02:14:33.031 --> 02:14:33.965
FOR ONE K. PLANS WERE NEVER

02:14:34.032 --> 02:14:35.434
INTENDED AS A REPLACEMENT FOR

02:14:35.500 --> 02:14:37.335
PENSIONS THEY WERE CONCEIVED BY

02:14:37.402 --> 02:14:40.005
A MAN NAMED TED BENNETT AND?

02:14:40.071 --> 02:14:40.639
NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE TED BENNETT

02:14:40.705 --> 02:14:41.740
WAS A CONSULTANT FOR THE JOHNSON

02:14:41.807 --> 02:14:43.775
COMPANY HIS CLIENT WAS A BANK

02:14:43.842 --> 02:14:45.110
PRESIDENT WHO WANTED TO REPLACE

HIS CASH BONUS PLAN WITH THE

DEFERRED RETIREMENT ACCOUNT.

02:14:48.547 --> 02:14:49.881
BENNETT DID SOME RESEARCH AND

02:14:49.948 --> 02:14:52.551
FOUND A LOOPHOLE IN THE IRS CODE

02:14:52.617 --> 02:14:53.652
FOUR OH ONE K..

02:14:53.718 --> 02:14:54.953
AND THAT ALLOWED THAT BANK

02:14:55.020 --> 02:14:56.555
PRESIDENT TO DEFERRED HIS

A FOUR ONE K. PLANS.

02:15:06.031 --> 02:15:07.065
THIS CHANGE HAS BEEN FINANCIALLY

02:15:07.132 --> 02:15:08.900
DEVASTATING FOR ALL BUT THE MOST

02:15:08.967 --> 02:15:10.936
HIGHLY PAID WORKERS PRIMARILY IN

02:15:11.002 --> 02:15:12.337
THE PUBLIC SECTOR.

02:15:12.404 --> 02:15:13.472
THE WALL STREET JOURNAL REPORTED

02:15:13.538 --> 02:15:15.040
THAT THE AVERAGE WORKER WITH A

02:15:15.106 --> 02:15:16.441
FOUR ONE K. RETIRES WITH ONLY

02:15:16.508 --> 02:15:18.944
ENOUGH SAVINGS TO LAST 25% INTO

02:15:19.010 --> 02:15:20.378
THEIR RETIREMENT.

02:15:20.445 --> 02:15:21.780
MANY OF THESE ARE BABY BOOMERS

02:15:21.847 --> 02:15:22.914
WHO WILL RETIRE AND END UP ON

02:15:22.981 --> 02:15:24.616
PUBLIC ASSISTANCE OR MOVING IN

FORCED TO GO BACK TO WORK DURING

02:15:27.185 --> 02:15:28.453
THEIR GOLDEN YEARS.

02:15:28.520 --> 02:15:29.654
EVEN BENNETT HAS SINCE BEEN

02:15:29.721 --> 02:15:31.189
QUOTED AS STATING THAT HE

02:15:31.256 --> 02:15:33.425
REGRETS CREATING THE FOUR ONE K.

02:15:33.492 --> 02:15:34.593
BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN APPLIED IN

02:15:34.659 --> 02:15:36.294
A MATTER THE BENEFITS WALL

RETAIN A RECRUIT POLICE AS THEY

02:15:44.069 --> 02:15:45.370
LEFT IN DROVES AND CRIME

02:15:45.437 --> 02:15:47.205
SKYROCKETED THE NEW MAYOR HAS

02:15:47.272 --> 02:15:48.940
SINCE NEGOTIATED A NEW DEAL TO

PLANS.

02:16:04.523 --> 02:16:05.891
THESE ARE THE WORST TYPE OF

02:16:05.957 --> 02:16:08.159
HYPOCRISIES THE FACT IS PENSIONS

02:16:08.226 --> 02:16:09.494

IF THEY WORK IN THE PRIVATE
