IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IT'S

00:56:57.680 --> 00:56:59.115
IT'S TREMENDOUS AND PEOPLE

00:56:59.182 --> 00:57:01.084
CANNOT LIVE IN THEIR OWN HOME

00:57:01.151 --> 00:57:02.552
UNLESS THEY HAVE SOME SORT OF

00:57:02.619 --> 00:57:05.789
SUBSIDY IN WE THIS PROGRAM HERE

00:57:05.855 --> 00:57:07.891
IS IT LEAVING A HOLE. IN IN

00:57:07.957 --> 00:57:09.726
PERPETUITY FOR PEOPLE WITH

00:57:09.793 --> 00:57:11.027

00:57:14.297 --> 00:57:15.598
CAN DONATE THIS HOME TO A

00:57:15.665 --> 00:57:17.867
HOUSING ORGANIZATION NONPROFIT.

00:57:17.934 --> 00:57:18.935
THAT WILL KEEP THEIR HOME FOR

00:57:19.002 --> 00:57:20.303
THE CHILD AND PROVIDE THEIR

00:57:20.370 --> 00:57:21.971
SUPPORT ENOUGH THAT HOME IS NO

LONGER APPROPRIATE FOR THE CHILD

00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:24.808
THEN THE MONEY CAN FOLLOW THE

00:57:24.874 --> 00:57:26.843
CHILDHOOD WHATEVER IS IMPORTANT

00:57:26.910 --> 00:57:28.545
SO WE HAVE A LACK OF HOUSING IN

CALIFORNIA. THIS MODEL IS GOING

00:57:31.047 --> 00:57:32.348
