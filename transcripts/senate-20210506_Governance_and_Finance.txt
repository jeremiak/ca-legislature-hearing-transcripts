HAS EFFECTIVELY CORNERED THE MARKET ON THIS POWERFUL OFFICE BY LITERALLY BANNING. EVERYONE ELSE FROM RUNNING IS SIMPLY UNACCEPTABLE IT LEADS TO A PROFOUND LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND CREATES MAJOR PROBLEMS IN VARIOUS COUNTY JAILS.

AND IN DEMO RESTRICTION ON WHO CAN RUN FOR SHERIFF. WE ARE CONTINUALLY REMINDED OF THE IMPORTANCE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT ACCOUNTABILITY WHEN IT COMES TO THE ROLE OF SHERIFF'S. SHERIFF'S CARRY OUT PUBLIC HEALTH ORDERS OR SOMETIMES DON'T CARRY THEM OUT.

TO THE SOUTH COAST AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT GOVERNING BOARD. DESPITE SIGNIFICANT AIR QUALITY IMPROVEMENT OVER THE LAST SEVERAL DECADES THE SOUTH COAST AIR BASIN HAS BECOME. AND IS ONE OF THE WORST AIR QUALITY- AREAS IN THE NATION. DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN OVERBURDENED WITH THE IMPACTS OF AIR POLLUTION AND CONTAMINATION IN THE SOUTH COAST BASIN WITH HIGHER RATES OF PREMATURE DEATHS. ASTHMA HOSPITALIZATIONS AND EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS ONLY EXACERBATED BY KOBE NINETEEN. THESE COMMUNITIES LIKE THOSE IN MY DISTRICT IN SOUTHEAST LOS ANGELES AND ALONG THE WEST SIDE OF LONG BEACH. AND THE I. SEVENTEEN CORRIDOR PAY THE HIGHEST COST WITH THEIR LIFE AND HEALTH. APPOINTING MEMBERS OF A COMMITTEE BOARD THAT REPRESENT AND WORK DIRECTLY WITH COMMUNITIES THAT ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY BURDENED. BY HIGH LEVELS OF POLLUTION WILL BRING VALUABLE EXPERTISE. CONCERNING THE ENVIRONMENTAL BURDENS THAT ARE UNDERMINING THE REGION'S ABILITY TO MEET AIR QUALITY STANDARDS. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THIS BILL DOES NOT UNDERMINE LOCAL CONTROL I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR. TWO THIRDS OF THE IT CAN D. BOARD. WOULD STILL BE APPOINTED BY LOCAL CITIES AND COUNTIES. AS B. THREE FORTY TWO WILL SIMPLY BEGIN CORRECTING INJUSTICES STEMMING FROM DECADES OF DISCRIMINATORY LAND USE AND POLICY DECISIONS. WE MUST ACT NOW TO DELIBERATELY INCLUDE INVOICES AND ESTABLISH ACTIVE LONG TERM COMMUNITY REPRESENTATION AS WE STRUGGLE TO MEET FEDERAL AIR QUALITY STANDARDS.

IT IS VITALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE ADDRESS OUR AIR QUALITY CHALLENGES THIS ROLE IS ONE I TAKE SERIOUSLY EIGHT IN MY ROLE ON THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD AS WELL AS LOCALLY AS A MEMBER OF THE SAN DIEGO AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT BOARD. BOTH OF THESE BOARDS HAVE PJ REPRESENTATION AND WE ARE MORE AFFECTED BODIES BECAUSE OF IT. I SERVE ON THE BOARD BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT ADDRESSING OUR AIR QUALITY ISSUES IT'S AN ABSOLUTE IMPERATIVE SH MANY REGIONS OF THE STATE ARE IN SEVERE NON ATTAINMENT WITH FEDERAL CLEAN AIR ACT STANDARDS SH WE HAVE CHILDREN THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA INCLUDING IN MY SUPERVISORY ALL DISTRICT.

OF FOUR TO FROM A FAMILY MEMBER TOGGLE IN NINE. BECAUSE IT IS. OUR PCT FOR AND WAY THAT DIRECTLY EXPANDED LOCAL. THIS CELL JUST LIKE A REPORT YOUR EMPOWERS WILL CONTROL IT DOESN'T TAKE IT AWAY. EMPOWERS LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE WITHOUT TAKING AWAY REPRESENTATION FROM ANY OTHER INDUSTRY OR IMPACTED GROUP. AND IT MAKE SURE THAT ALL VOICES ARE EQUAL THIRTY SECONDS LOCAL COMMUNITY MEMBERS. ARE TRULY ACCOUNTABLE TO THE COMMUNITY THEY REPRESENT BECAUSE THEY LIVE AND WORK THERE.

COALITION FOR CLEAN AIR STRONGLY SUPPORTS SB THREE FORTY TWO WHAT WOULD ADD TWO NEW SEATS TO SOUTH COAST EACH YEAR MEANS GOVERNING BOARD. TO BETTER REPRESENT ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES. THOSE LIVING AND WORKING IN THE SOUTH COAST AIR BASIN READ SOME OF THE DIRTIEST AIR IN THE NATION. SADLY THIS BURDEN FALLS HEAVIEST ON DISADVANTAGED AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. MANY OF THE COMMUNITIES ARE LOCATED NEAR POLLUTION SOURCES SUCH AS REFINERIES. THE RECORD. INDUSTRIAL FACILITIES. DECISIONS MAY DECADES. SUCH AS BILL FREEWAYS THROUGH OUR NAME. CONTINUE TO HAVE ONE LASTING HEALTH AND- NO LESS FIVE LARGE OIL. THE BOOK OF CAL OIL REFINING. ARE WE SEE OR NEAR LAFAYETTE IS WILLING NC PETER NEIGHBOR AS WELL AS THE CITY OF CARSON. TODAY WE'RE ARE SPREAD UP CLOSE AND CLOSER TO HOME SCHOOLS IN THE INLAND EMPIRE BRINGING POLLUTION TRAFFIC IN OTHER QUALITY OF LIFE IMPACTS CLOSE TO HOME AND IN SOME CASES NEXT DOOR. THE SOUTH COAST AIR BASIN IS CURRENTLY IN A NON IS IN NON ATTAINMENT OF MULTIPLE FEDERAL AND STATE AIR QUALITY STANDARDS. FURTHER THE TOXIC AIR CANCER RISK WHICH IS ALREADY ELEVATED IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ITS HIGHEST IN COMMUNITIES NEAR GOODS MOVEMENT CORRIDORS DUE TO DIESEL PARTICULATE MATTER. THE EFFECT OF THAT COUPLED WITH OTHER INEQUITIES ARE STARK. THE LIFESPAN IN MY ZIP CODE ON THE WESTERN SIDE OF LONG BEACH IS THAT THE EIGHT YEAR SHORTER. THAN THE MARK CITIES MORE OF FLUID EASTERN ZIP CODES. AT THREE FORTY TWO WOULD BEGIN CORRECTING THIS PROBLEM BY GIVING ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES MORE REPRESENTATION. CURRENTLY THE FORMS AVAILABLE THE KEY TO YOUR COMMUNITIES ARE AT BEST ADVISORY. PRESENTATION WILL NOT PREDETERMINE OUTCOMES OF THE RULE MAKINGPROCESS RATHER IT GIVES IMPACTED COMMUNITIES AN ACTUAL DIRECT VOICE ON THE MATTERS ABOUT THE AIR THEY BREATHE.

AND A LINE FOR OVER TWO HUNDRED BUSINESS ORGANIZATION TO REPRESENT OVER FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND EMPLOYERS AND FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING. WE ARE CALLING IN OPPOSITION TO SB THREE FORTY TWO FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS. WHY THE BILL IS UNNECESSARY SPEAKER OF THE FAMILY THE FEDERAL COMMITTEE AND THE GOVERNOR ALREADY HAVE AN APPOINTMENT TO BE CAN BE BORED. THEIR APPOINTEES TIME AND TIME AGAIN HAVE EXPRESSED THEIR COMMITMENT TO IMPROVING OUR ENVIRONMENT. BUT BOTH THE SENATE AND THE ASSEMBLY APPOINTEES RESIDE IN ENVIRONMENTAL. COMMUNITIES ADDRESS I CALLIN BUYERS. NUMBER TWO IF WE CAN GOOGLE LOCAL CONTROL. IT TAKES THREE TO AUTHORITY AWAY FROM LOCAL. WERE HELD ACCOUNTABLE THEIR CONSTITUENTS. AT THREE FORTY TWO WOULD GET THEIR APPOINTED NOT ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES ONE THIRD OF THE SEATS IN THE REGIONAL BOARD THAT IS MEANT TO BE REPRESENTED BY LOCAL INTERESTS. AND IS CURRENTLY REPRESENTED BY THIRTEEN HUNDRED BUSHELS FROM THE AREA THE ELECTED OFFICIALS SERVING ON THE BOARD HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO THEIR VOTERS. AND THE VOTERS ALLOWED THE PUBLICATION OF THE WEEKEND BY ADDING MORE POINTS YOU SCORE NOT ACCOUNTABLE TO THE PUBLIC. NUMBER THREE AND ATTACKED THE COMPETENCE OF LOCAL LEADERS BY ADDING BOARD SEATS AT THE THREE FORTY. FIVE BUT LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS SERVING ON THE BOARD ARE NOT EFFECTIVELY SETTING LOCAL POLICIES. SOMETHING OF A CURRENT THIRTEEN MORE MEMBER BOARD HAS DONE FOR ALMOST FIFTY YEARS. THANK YOU THE RECENTLY RELEASED THEIR MADE FIVE STUDY WHICH MEASURES THE PROGRESS MADE AN ERRANT ACTION. AND SOME OF THE GREATEST RSK REDUCTIONS HAVE OCCURRED ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES. SPECIFICALLY THE STUDY SHOWED BACK IN TWENTY TWELVE TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN A 55% REDUCTION IN THE CROATIAN HEALTH RISK FROM AIR CONTAMINANTS. NINETEEN NINETY THE REGION'S POPULATION INCREASED BY ABOUT 30% IN THE REGION HAS EXPERIENCED A GREATER THAN 75% REDUCTION IN INFLATION HELPED RESTRICT AIR CONTAMINANTS. I KNOW DON'T DESIGN VALUES DECREASED BY ABOUT FIFTY PERCENT. IT SHOWS THAT THE PARTICULAR MATTER CONTINUE TO BE THE PRIMARY RISK DRIVER IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. BUT ON OUR DIESEL EMISSIONS WILL DROP BY THE DIVISIONAL 7080% BY TWENTY TWENTY THREE DUE TO CARBURETION. THE FALCONS AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT. HAS MORE THAN EFFECTIVELY REDUCED. FEATURED BUDGETED OVER SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OR EIGHTY SIX SEVENTEEN COMMUNITIES WHICH REQUIRED THE DISTRICT TO FORMULATE DURING MANY. WHO DIRECTLY WORK WITH STAFF TO PRIORITIZE AREAS FOR REDUCTION. THIRTY SECONDS YOU'VE EARNED ALREADY TODAY. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THE THREE FORTY TWO IF NECESSARY AND DOES NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THE INCREDIBLE WORK THAT'S ALREADY BEEN DONE BY THE AGENCY BOARD MEMBERS OVER THE YEARS. THE CURRENT MAKE UP OF THE BOARD SHOULD REMAIN WITH A LOCAL ELECTED LEADERS NOT WITH A POINTY ONLY HELD ACCOUNTABLE BY THE A POINTERS. WE STRONGLY OPPOSE SB THREE FORTY TWO THANK YOU.

HISTORY DECISIONS HAVE BEEN MADE. ABOUT THEM. I AM NOT BY THEM. OR NOT WITH THEIR PARTICIPATION. AND INPUT- AND WE KNOW WHAT THE IMPACTS ARE. WHEN OUR FRONT LINE WORKING CLASS COMMUNITIES OF COLOR IN PARTICULAR- ARE NOT AT THE TABLE AND DON'T HAVE THE VOICE THAT THEY NEED. IT IS NOT A COINCIDENCE WHEN WE LOOK AT WHERE FREEWAYS ARE BUILT WITH A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF POLLUTION THAT COMES OFF THOSE FREEWAYS IT'S NOT A COINCIDENCE. THAT THOSE FREEWAYS THAT OVERWHELMINGLY WERE BUILT THROUGH LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR BECAUSE THAT WAS CONSIDERED TO BE THE POLITICALLY EASIEST QUOTE ON QUOTE- APPROACH. BECAUSE THESE ARE COMMUNITIES THAT WERE PERCEIVED AS NOT BEING ABLE TO STAND UP. FOR THEMSELVES AND SO THEY GOT ROLLED HI AND THE AND THE IMPACTS THE HEALTH IMPACTS WERE HUGE IN TERMS OF HEALTH AND THE HEALTH OF CHILDREN AND SO FORTH. HIGHWAYS TO GO RIGHT BY LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES SCHOOLS AND PLAYGROUNDS AND HOMES. WHEN WE LOOK AT WHERE.

FIRST WE HAVE LONGSTANDING LAND USE ORDINANCES TO HELP PREVENT URBAN SPRAWL AND PROTECT NATURAL RESOURCES WHILE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO INCREASE THE BUILDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IN NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT FIFTY THREE YEARS AGO WE ESTABLISHED THE FIRST AGRICULTURAL PRESERVE ZONING DESIGNATION IN THE UNITED STATES. AND SINCE THEN OUR LAND USE PRINCIPLES ARE AGRICULTURAL LAND SHOULD BE PROTECTED AND DEVELOPMENT SHOULD OCCUR IN URBAN AREA. AND THE PILOT PROGRAM WOULD NOT DISTURB THOSE GUIDING TENET. OUR SECOND CENTRAL REASON FOR SUPPORTING SB THIRTEEN RELATE TO HOW IT CAN HELP PROPERTY OWNERS IN THE AGRICULTURAL PLAN TO CREATE MORE AGRICULTURAL EMPLOYEE HOUSING. PURSUANT TO HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE SECTION ONE SEVEN OH TWO ONE POINT EIGHT. THE COST OF BUILDING SUCH HOUSING INCLUDE ADEQUATE WELL WATER AND SEPTIC SYSTEM IF ONE BUILDING ON AGRICULTURAL LAND. REDUCING THOSE COSTS BY MAKING THE POSSIBILITY OF ACCEPTING PUBLIC WATER AND SEWER WILL ADD AN INCENTIVE. FOR AGRICULTURAL PROPERTY OWNERS TO SEEK TO BUILD SUCH HOUSING WITHOUT REQUIRING TO AG LAND BE TAKEN INTO.

THANK YOU SO MUCH- MISTER CHAIR VERY EXCITED TO BE HERE AND- I'VE ALWAYS BEEN AN ADVOCATE FOR- COLLABORATIVE IMBALANCE LEGISLATION SO WE CAN COME TOGETHER AND WORK. COLLABORATIVELY TO MAKE THESE HAPPEN- WERE ON BOARD. I WOULD LIKE TO THINK THAT YOU'RE IN THE SOUTH FOR ALL THE HARD WORK THEY HAVE PUT INTO BOTH OF MY BILLS THAT ARE UP TODAY SB SIX WANTED TO STEP TO THE RIGHT DIRECTION TOWARDS AT LEVELING THE PLAYING FIELD FOR FIRST TIME HOME BUYERS. IT WOULD DO SO BY ALLOWING HOMEOWNERS TO SELL THEIR HOMES TO A FIRST TIME HOME BUYER TO EXCLUDE CAPITAL GAINS- OF THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR SINGLE FILERS INSTEAD OF THE CURRENT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS MAXIMUM. IS SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND FOR JOINT FILERS INSTEAD OF THE CURRENT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND MAXIMUM FOR BOTH FOR. FROM THEIR GROSS INCOME. AS WE KNOW CALIFORNIA IS MADE TO THE HOUSING CRISIS. THE MEDIAN PRICE OF A SINGLE FAMILY HOME IN CALIFORNIA'S OVER SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS WHICH IS MORE THAN TWICE THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. AN ANALYSIS DONE BY THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS SHOW THAT ONLY 20% OF HOUSEHOLDS COULD AFFORD A HOME AT THIS PRICE. 28% BECAUSE OF THESE HIGH PRICES MOSTLY DUE TO THE SEVERE LACK OF HOUSING SUPPLY TO MEET INCREASED DEMAND. ONE OF THE MANY CONSEQUENCE OF THE SUPPLY SHORTAGE. IS EXTREMELY COMPETITIVE MARKET FOR POTENTIAL HOME BUYERS. ESPECIALLY BUYERS LOOKING. BUYERS LOOKING TO PURCHASE THEIR FIRST HOME. MMHM AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I EXPERIENCED PERSONALLY AS A REAL TORE. UP MEANT THAT CALIFORNIA RANKED AS A TOP THIS RATE IN THE NATION PER PERSON HOME BUYERS ACCORDING TO A REPORT DONE BY BANKRATE .COM. THE REPORT NAMES AND NUMBER OF REASONS FOR THIS RANKING. THE RELATIVELY HIGH COST OF HOUSING THE TIGHT MARKET FOR AVAILABLE ENTRY LEVEL HOMES. AND THE STRUGGLE FOR THE MILLIONS FACING SAVING FOR A DOWNPAYMENT. HOMEOWNERSHIP IS THE BEDROCK OF THE AMERICAN DREAM TOO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE ARE SEEING THIS REMOVED FURTHER FURTHER AWAY. BUT IF THE REACH DUE TO THE HIGH COST OF HOUSING AND THE LACK OF OPPORTUNITY IN CALIFORNIA. SIX A ONE IS JUST A SMALL STEP THAT WE CAN TAKE TOWARDS MAKING THAT DREAM A MORE ATTAINABLE.

MR VICE CHAIR THAT A MOTION SIR. BILL THANK YOU SO MUCH WE DO HAVE A MOTION AC GENERAL COMMITTEE EMOTION BY- THE DEAN OF THE SENATE VICE CHAIR NIELSEN. ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS CONVERSATION PLEASE SENATOR AWESOME YES I JUST WANT TO SAY I HAVE. TO WELL CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL- IN THAT WHAT IT REALLY- HELP FIRST TIME HOME OWNERS. I THINK THAT'S A BIG QUESTION FOR ME AND I WOULD PREFER THAT WE DO THIS THROUGH PROGRAMS THAT ALREADY EXIST FOR FIRST TIME HOME BUYERS- I THINK OTHERWISE IT'S THIS THE TAXPAYER THE SELLER OF THE HOME. THAT WOULD BE GETTING A WINDFALL THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH VERY GRATEFUL. ALL RIGHT. SEEING NO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS COMMENTS- WE'RE GONNA TURN IT BACK TO CENTER TO A VOTE IF YOU WANNA PLEASE ADDRESS THE CONCERN THAT WAS ADVANCED BY CENTER DRAWS ABOUT. HOW THIS IS SERIOUS THE FINANCING- RECEIVING THE FINANCING. THE INSURING THAT FIRST TIME HOME BUYERS ARE GOING TO BE ASSISTED BY THE BILL AND THEN WE'LL TAKE THAT YOUR CLOTHES THANK YOU SO MUCH ENERGY OVER. THANK YOU SENATOR R. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I WOULD BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO ADDRESS THE QUESTION AND I THINK IT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION IN IN HELPING TO UNDERSTAND THE PROCESS IN WHICH THIS WORKS. I'VE BEEN A REALTOR FOR EIGHTEEN YEARS IN BROAD REALTOR HELPING FAMILIES ACHIEVE THE AMERICAN DREAM WHICH IN MY OPINION IT IS THE BEDROCK OF HOMEOWNERSHIP. THE REASON THIS BILL HELPS. EIGHT GET FIRST TIME ENTRY LEVEL OR FIRST TIMER ENTRY LEVEL HOMEOWNERS INTO HOMES. IS THAT WHEN A SELLER'S LIST HER HOME. YOU FOR THE MOST PART ESPECIALLY IN OUR AREA IN THE INLAND EMPIRE. WE USUALLY HAVE MULTIPLE. OFFERS AND- THE MORE OFFERS WHAT WE DO AS LEASING AGENTS IS THAT WE- SORT OF PRIORITIZED OF COURSE SELLERS ALWAYS WHEN MAXIMIZE THEIR THEIR GAMES THEY'RE LOOKING AT DATE OFFERS THAT WILL NET THEM THE MOST MONEY. SO WHAT HAPPENS IS CASH BUYERS ALWAYS HAVE AN ADVANTAGE BECAUSE THEY'RE QUICK AND THEY'RE USUALLY NOT THAT THE SELLER THE MOST MONEY. AND THEN YOU HAVE SECONDARY TO THAT YOU HAVE FINANCED BUYERS WHICH ARE NORMALLY ARE FIRST TIME HOME BUYERS WHO ARE USUALLY THE ONES ARE HAVING TO FINANCE OUR HOME. SO WHEN THEY'RE LOOKING AT MULTILE OFFERS IF THE SELLER HAS THE OPTION TO SAY OKAY WE HAVE A CASH BUYER WHICH USUALLY SOMETIMES EITHER OFFER AT. I'M I'M GIVING YOU THE PRACTICAL REAL LIFE SCENARIO HERE. THEY WILL USUALLY GIVE FULL PRICE OFFERS ON THESE HOMES. FINANCE OFFERS FIRST TIME BUYERS USUALLY WILL OFFER A LITTLE BIT MORE OR ASK PRICE IF THEY WANT TO COMPETE AT ALL. SO WHAT HAPPENS IS WHEN YOU HAVE A CASH BUYER AND HAVE A FINANCED BUYER. WITH FINE AS BUYERS SELLERS HAVE MORE COST ON THEIR END TO USUALLY. END WILL NET A LITTLE LESS SO WHAT THE DISPOSITION IS THAT IF WE HAD A PROGRAM SUCH AS THIS WHERE IT ACTUALLY- GIVES THE ABILITY FOR SELLERS TO NET MORE MONEY. BY HAVING A HIGHER EXCLUSION FROM TWO HUNDRED FIFTY TO THREE HUNDRED FROM FIVE HUNDRED TO SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN ACTION NULLIFIES SOME OF THAT COST THAT COMES FROM ACCEPTING A FINANCED BUYER. SO IT ACTUALLY INCENTIVIZES THEM TO SAY FIRST TIME HOME BUYER I WANT THIS FAMILY SPECIALLY SOMEONE WHO'S LIVED IN THE HOME FOR A VERY LONG TIME. LOOKS AT A YOUNG FAMILY COMING IN FOR HALF AND YOU TEACHER COMING INTO THE CITY AND SAYS OKAY WE HAVE A- A FINANCED BUYER. BUT YOU HAVE THIS IN PLACE. IN THEN YOU HAVE A BUYER. IT USUALLY WILL WILL INCENTIVIZE THE SELLER TO CHOOSE A FIRST TIME BUYER FIRST A CASH BUYER TO GIVE THEM A LITTLE BIT OF AN INCENTIVE TO SAY OKAY EVEN THOUGH THIS WHOLE LEVEL US OUT FINANCIALLY SO THAT THE FIRST TIME BUYER CAN ACTUALLY HAVE A CHANCE AT GETTING THAT OFFER ACCEPTED. VERSES THAT ALL CASH BUYERS SO THAT'S WHY IN THIS INSTANCE OF ICE THE FIRST TIME BUYER IT'S ACTUALLY A GREAT BENEFIT. FOR OUR BUYERS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE SOMETHING IN PLACE BECAUSE IT ALLOWS ME TO COMPETE WITH CASH BUYERS. THAT'S YOUR QUESTION SENATOR RAWSON. THIRD RESIDUE TO COMMENT. IF THANK YOU FOR THE ANSWER THANK YOU SO MUCH SIR ALL RIGHT I KNOW WE WERE JUST IN THE CLOTHES THERE- SO BRIEFLY PLEASE MR VICE CHAIR. I JUST WANT TO ADD THIS WOULD BE IN THE- RESPONSE TO MY OWN MOTION HERE. OVER THE MONTHS WHAT WE'VE BEEN SEEING IN THIS REAL ESTATE MARKET. IS I'M SORRY MR VENTURE DO YOU MIND IF. THE WHAT WE SEE IN THE REAL ESTATE MARKET IS. A SELLER WILL PUT A PRICE. AND THEN THE DESCENDANTS OF THEIR DESCENDED UPON BY THOSE WHO WILL PAY WAY OVER THE PRICE. NOW THAT KIND OF PERSON THE CASE PERSON IS NOT GOING TO BE. THE ONE WHO HAS RESOURCES IT'S NOT GOING TO BE THE FIRST TIME BUYER. WE NEED AND THAT'S WHAT THIS TARGETS THAT FIRST TIME BUYER WHO'S STRUGGLING A LITTLE BIT. AND WHO CAN'T KEEP BUILDING IN THE PRICE UP FILL IT AND IF IT FITS INTO THE MARKET. NICHE RIGHT NOW. TO LIGHT A FIRE IN REAL ESTATE AND DEVELOP CONFIDENCE. IN THE COMMUNITIES. ALONG THE OTHER THINGS THAT WE HAVE GOT TO DO BUT I THINK IT'S A GOOD BILL I STAND BY MY MOST. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER VICE CHAIR SO LAZY AND WE DO HAVE THAT MOTION ON THE FLOOR BY THE VICE CHAIR. OF WE ARE GONNA TURN IT OVER TO CHILL BOOK THE SEARCH- BOOK FOR THE CLOTHES. I JUST I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT. WE CAN PUT THIS ON THE SELLERS AT SELLERS ADVANTAGE BUT IT TRULY IS A WAY TO BENEFIT AND HELP AND ASSIST UP FIRST TIME BUYER GET INTO AND HAVE. A CHANCE. AT HAVING AT THEIR OFFERS ACCEPTED. THE NICE XP SPEAKS TO THAT FACT AS A REALTOR FOR EIGHTEEN YEARS HELPING YOUNG FAMILIES AND- YOUNG. YOUNG PROFESSIONAL DOES TRYING TO GET INTO THE MARKET AND I CAN TELL YOU FROM FIRSTHAND THAT THIS WOULD BE AN INCREDIBLE PROGRAM. TO HELP OR FIRST TIME BUYERS GET INTO OUR HOME. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW I'M A DAUGHTER OF IMMIGRANT PARENTS AND FIRST GENERATION HERE AND I CAN TELL YOU. BUY MY FIRST HOME WAS THE MOST AMAZING. EXPERIENCE THAT I'VE HAD AS A AS A HUMAN BEING AS A AS A AS SOMEONE WHO LIVES IN THIS COUNTRY AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT WHEN I BOUGHT MY FIRST HOME. MY DAD CAME OVER AND WAS LOOKING AT THE HOUSE AND WAS DOING OUTSIDE OF OUR WINDOW AND JUST LOOKED AT ME WITH TEARS IN HIS EYES AND SAID. HI YOU ARE RIGHT YOU MADE HE WAS SO PROUD THAT I HAVE ACHIEVED THAT DREAM. SO BEAR WITH ME AS I HAD. ADDRESSED THE FOLLOWING STATEMENTS IN SPANISH FOR THOSE THAT CAN UNDERSTAND AND WHO ARE SPYING TO BE HOMEOWNERS HERE IN CALIFORNIA.

THANK YOU MR CHAIR. HIS B. SIX ME BYE WITH SIMPLY GIVE COUNTIES THE OPTION. TO IMPLEMENT A PROGRAM THAT TO ALLOW TAXPAYERS FOR SIXTY TWO YEARS OF AGE OR OLDER OR WHO RECEIVE SUPPLEMENTAL SECURITY INCOME. TO PAY THEIR PROPERTY TAXES IN MONTHLY INSTALLMENTS. RATHER THAN INTO LUMP SUMS. THIS WOULD BE A VOLUNTARY PROGRAM FOR BOTH THE COUNTY. AND THAT TAXPAYER. ALL ABOUT OPTIONS AND CHOICES AS EXISTING LAW STANDS NOW PROPERTY TAXES ARE PAID INTO ANNUAL INSTALLMENTS EXCEPT IF AN ORDER IS IN DEFAULT. THIS SYSTEM BECOMES PART PARTICULAR PROBLEM WHEN HOMEOWNERS OWNED THE PROPERTY OUT RIGHT ARE NO LONGER PAYMENT MONTHLY MORTGAGES AND HAVE NO IMPOUND ACCOUNTS. THEY MUST RELY ON THEIR OWN CASH MANAGEMENT AND BUDGETING SKILLS TO AVOID DEFAULT PENALTIES AND POTENTIAL BURGLARS ENTERED RESIDENCIES. THIS IS PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT FOR TAXPAYERS RELY ON FIXED INCOMES SUCH AS THOSE OVER THE AGE OF SIXTY TWO AND TAXPAYERS WHO RECEIVE SUPPLEMENTAL SECURITY INCOME FOR DISABILITY. SB SIX SEVENTY FIVE WILL ALLOW-COUNTIES TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR INDIVIDUALS LIVING ON FIXED INCOMES TO PAY THE PRINCIPAL. OF THE TAX DEADLY. THIS BILL IS A TIMELY GIVEN. THE INCREASED NUMBER OF OPTIONS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO COUNTIES THANKS TO RECENT TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES ONE SUCH OPTION IS A PROGRAM DEVELOPED AT THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES FINANCE COMMITTEE CALL THE EASY SMART PAY. IN COUNTIES THAT OFFER EASY SMART PASTE A SOLUTION FACTORS CAN CHOOSE TO CREATING EASY SMART PAY ACCOUNT TO PAY PROPERTY TAXES MONTHLY WITH A CREDIT OR DEBIT CARD OR DIRECTLY FROM THE CHECKING ACCOUNT. THERE'S NO COST TO THE COUNTY ONCE AGAIN NO COST TO THE COUNTY AND NO NEED TO DEVELOP A NEW SYSTEM OR SOFTWARE ONCE AGAIN. NO NEW SYSTEM OR SOFTWARE AS EASY SMART BAKING GENERATES SEAMLESSLY WITH EXISTING SYSTEMS. EASY SMARTPAY HAS BEEN A PILOT PHASE FOR THREE YEARS BUT SEE SACKS FINANCE COMMITTEE SAY THEY HAVE THIS PROGRAM. THIS PROGRAM TO. TO HAVE THIS PROGRAM BE AVAILABLE TO ALL COUNTIES IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS. JOIN ME TO TESTIFY SUPPORTERS ALLEGRA FOURTEEN RT ON BEHALF OF THE SPONSOR OF THIS BILL THE CALIFORNIA SENIOR LEGISLATURE.

LATER THE FLOOR IS YOURS WE WELCOME YOU TO COMMITTEE PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU AND GOOD AFTERNOON I AM A LIQUOR FORTUNE ARE YOU A MEMBER FROM SAN FRANCISCO THE CALIFORNIA. LEGISLATURE SH AND ORGANIZATION SPONSORING THE BILL I WISH TO EXPRESS MY VERY STRONG SUPPORT FOR SB SIX SEVENTY FIVE- WHICH HAS BEEN DESCRIBED BY- SENATOR- SHOW ABOUT- AS THIS BILL IS FOR RESIDENTS OR JUST LOOKING FOR AN EASIER WAY TO PAY THEIR TAXES AND WOULD NOT NEED A PROGRAM LIKE THE CO. PROPERTY TAXES PHONE MINT PROGRAM OUTLINED IN THE ANALYSIS. UNDER THE EXISTING PAYMENT. SYSTEM BY ANNUAL PROPERTY TAX BILLS TO BE A SHOCK TO THOSE HOMEOWNERS WHO OWN THEIR PROPERTY OUT RIGHT AND NO LONGER HAD THE IMPOUND ACCOUNTS THERE IS A NEED NOW FOR ANOTHER OPTION THAT WILL HELP HOMEOWNERS SHOULD MORE EASILY MANAGE THEIR PAYMENTS NOT ONLY. FOR LOW INCOME OLDER ADULTS BUT FOR ADULTS WHO ARE CARING FOR AND HANDLING FINANCES AND THEIR OLDER FRAIL OR DISABLED PARENTS. SOME WITH LIMITED COGNITIVE ABILITY. A MONTHLY PAYMENT OPTION CAN ALSO TAKE A HUGE BURDEN OFF CONSERVATIVES REDUCE AREAS AND REPRESENTATIVE PAYEES SERVICE POPULATIONS CREATING A SYSTEM WITH AUTOMATIC DEDUCTIONS THAT HELP THEM EASILY MANAGE PROPERTY TAX PAYMENTS. WE L. MEMBER TO BE A- OF SUCH SYSTEM THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS AND FRIENDS HAVE RUN A SALAD EXISTING BI ANNUAL. TAX PAYMENT SYSTEM ON HER SYSTEM THAT CAN LEAD TO INTEREST PAYMENTS AND PENALTIES FOR DELINQUENCIES AND DEFAULTS. AND EVEN PUT THEM IN JEOPARDY OF LOSING THEIR HOMES AND EVENTS THAT CAN BE PARTICULARLY DEVASTATED ORDERED CALIFORNIA TO KNOW WITH LOWER INCOME. OTHER MEMBERS WHO HAVE FINANCIAL POWERS OF ATTORNEY FOR THEIR TRAIL PARENTS HAVE TALKED THROUGH THE ADVANTAGES OF SUCH A SYSTEM SH WHEN MANAGING TAX PAYMENTS FOR THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS. THIS BILL ALSO FURTHERS THE GOVERNOR'S MASTER PLAN FOR AGING WHICH HAS CALLED FOR AN AGING DISABILITY FRIENDLY CALIFORNIA. THAT ENABLES OLDER ADULTS AND ABLE. THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COUNTY TREASURERS AND TAX COLLECTORS OPPOSED THE BILL BECAUSE IN THE END THEY'RE MISTAKEN PERCEPTION THAT IF ADOPTED THEIR COUNTIES WOULD HAVE TO COMPLETELY UPGRADE OR REPLACE THEIR EXISTING TAX COLLECTION SYSTEM. BUT AT LEAST SIX SEVENTY FIVE DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY UPDATES OR REPLACEMENTS BECAUSE THE BILL IS SILENT ABOUT THE METHOD OF IMPLEMENTATION. AS AN EXAMPLE OF AN INEXPENSIVE ALTERNATIVE SEATAC- FINANCE CORPORATION IS CURRENTLY DEVELOPED A PAYMENT GATEWAY PLATFORM. EASY SMART PAY THAT ALLOWS HOMEOWNERS TO SET UP AUTOMATIC MONTHLY PAYMENTS WHICH THE DEBIT OR CREDIT CARD OR DIRECT SECOND THEIR BANK ACCOUNT E. EIGHTY AGE. INTO A PROPERTY TAX ACCOUNT THE ONLY EXPENSE ACCOUNT NEEDS TO BE ADDING THIS OPTION TO THEIR WEBSITE THAT ADVERTISED THE AVAILABILITY EACH TO THEIR RESIDENCE I RESPECTFULLY AND STRONGLY URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR SB SIX SEVENTY FIVE.

TO SP SIX SEVENTY FIVE WE DO HAVE ONE LEAD OPPOSITION WITNESS THAT'S CAROLING CAROLING REPRESENTS THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COUNTY TREASURERS AND TAX COLLECTORS MISSLING THE FLOOR IS YOURS YOUR THREE MINUTES IT WILL GIVE YOU THIRTY SECOND PROBLEM. GOOD AFTERNOON GOOD AFTERNOON THIS LINE. THANK YOU SENATOR I THINK I THINK YOU MISTER CHAIR CAROLING AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION. ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COUNTY TREASURERS AND TAX COLLECTORS. R. POSE FOR A COUPLE OF REALLY KEY REASONS I WANT TO EMPHASIZE TODAY AND WOULD YOU RECOGNIZE THAT IT IS NOT A MANDATE ON COUNTY BUT ONLY AN OPTION. ALTHOUGH IN REALITY IT'S NOT REALLY AN OPTION BECAUSE THERE'S NO FUNDING ASSOCIATED WITH HOW CAN YOU SHED EMPLOYMENT. ARE PROPOSED PROGRAM FOR ELIGIBLE TAXPAYERS. MOST IMPORTANTLY THE PROPERTY TAX SYSTEM EVEN THOSE COMPANIES ARE DECADES OLD AND ARE NOT FLEXIBLE OR EASILY CHANGED. AND WHEN THEY WERE WHEN THEY WERE SENT OUT. THEY WERE SET UP TO FOLLOW THE CURRENT GUIDELINES WHICH ARE A FULL TIME TEN DECEMBER TENTH INNING AND THEY'RE SET UP TO COLLECT POINTS HERE. AND THE PENALTIES AND INTEREST THAT APPLY FOR LATE PAYMENTS ARE SET UP TO APPLY BASED ON THE TWO TIMES PER YEAR PAYMENT SYSTEM. ACCOUNTED THAT HAVE GONE THROUGH THE PROCESS OF UPDATING YOUR TALK TAX DOCTOR WHO SPENT TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO DO SO AND IT TAKES SEVERAL YEARS TO DO IT RIGHT I CANNOT EMPHASIZE. THE WALLET I NOTICED THEY ARE YOU KNOW HAVING A VERY LARGE TECHNOLOGY PROJECTS. THAT INVOLVE PEOPLE MONEY HAS TO BE DONE RIGHT AND IT'S VERY VERY EXPENSIVE TO DO STORY COUNTY DEPARTMENT SHARE THE PROPERTY. TAX COLLECTIONS COLLECTIONS OF FOUND. WE DON'T HAVE A- TO. THE PROGRAM THAT BEING PROPOSED- JOHN HUNT COUNTY DEPARTMENT THAT RELY ON. THE BUDGET AND BACK JUST LIKE EVERY OTHER. AND I'VE YOU CAN. RIGHT ABOUT NOW THEY'RE NOT WINNING AND THEY HAVE TO GO UP AGAINST THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. PROXIMITY FURTHERMORE MAKING A CHANGE TO MONTHLY BILLING WOULD COST A HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY TO A VERY. SMALL POTENTIAL GROUP OF TAXPAYERS GIVEN OTHER PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AND ANALYSES. BEFORE THE WAR TRYING TO KEEP TRACK OF THEM MONTHLY BILLING. AND AN EXCEL CHART- QUICKBOOKS IS NOT THE SOLUTION THOSE ARE OFFLINE MANUAL OPTIONS DON'T COMPORT WITH OUR PLUG INTO THE PROPERTY TAX SYSTEM. AND ARE MORE VULNERABLE TO HUMAN ERROR WHICH CANNOT HAPPEN GIVEN THE CONSEQUENCE OF THE CAR. AND SECONDLY THE BILLET RESTRAINT APPEARS TO REQUIRE MONTHLY. APPOINTMENTS TO THE TAXING ENTITIES. ONE UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT OF THAT GIVEN THAT HEATER PERSON'S NOT HERE COUNTY AND WHAT THAT MEANS FOR THE TAXING ENTITIES. AS FAR AS WHETHER OR NOT THE SCHOOL OF THE CITY AT THE SPECIALISTS ARE ALL HAVE TO KEEP TRACK. OF WHAT THEY RECEIVE MONTHLY BURST OF. FIRE IN THE COMMUNAL INSTALLMENT APPORTIONMENT. AND YOU SHOULD TO LEGISLATURE ABOUT HALF OF WHAT WE COLLECTED SCHOOL MONEY. AT THE CRITICAL TO BE DONE CORRECTLY. AND THEN FINALLY IN THE BILL IN ITS CURRENT FORM DOES CREATE SOME QUALITY GAPS IT SHOULD BE ENACTED ALONG WITH IT. AND SPEAKING TO THE TEACHER IS DOING OTHER THINGS. AND I WASN'T EXPECTING AN EASY SMART PAINT PROGRAM CAN BE REFERENCED BUT IT'S WORTH NOTING IN THIS CASE. IT DIDN'T REQUIRE LEGISLATION TO BE ESTABLISHED. THEY DO CHARGE TAX. EVERY MONTH FOR THE SERVICE. AND BASED REMAIN ACCOUNT IN THE TWO ANNUAL INSTALLMENT. WHICH BRINGS US BACK TO OUR ORIGINAL CONCERN. WE ARE NOT SET UP FOR THAT. THE REASON WE REGRETFULLY OUR CLOSING ASPECTS NEED TO HOLD THE MEASURE TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND MISS FLYING APPRECIATE THE TESTIMONY IS ALWAYS GOOD TO HEAR YOUR VOICE HOPE YOU'RE DOING WELL IT'S FAMILIES WHO WELL LET'S.

THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PARTNERSHIP. IN ALSO THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS CRITICAL ISSUE. WELL THANK YOU I MISTER CHAIR ON SENATOR MCGUIRE- FOR THAT INTRODUCTION ON THE ON. THE IT'S B- NO PROPOSITION NINETEEN IT WAS CANCER S. B. NINETEEN. F. B. SIX SIXTY EIGHT- IT IS A VERY VERY SERIOUS- ISSUE THAT DEVELOPED AFTER THE- VOTE OF FOUR EIGHT GMT ON NOVEMBER ELECTIONS SO I'M VERY PLEASED TO PRESENT IT TODAY ON AND WE WILL HAVE THAT ONGOING DISCUSSION BECAUSE IT NEEDS FIXES AS WE ALL KNOW. OF THE OUTCRY CAME AFTER ON I THINK THE VOTE- ON PAST IT. I MEAN IT PASSED WITH A VOTE. THAT ACTUALLY BROUGHT IT TO MY ATTENTION ALL AS I GOT MANY MANY CALLS FROM TRUST ATTORNEYS IN RESIDENCE ON. THE FACT THAT THEY WERE UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING MANY BUILDINGS WERE CLOSED AT THAT TIME SO IT IS A VERY VERY TIMELY ISSUE AS FAMILIES LOOK AT THESE INTERGENERATIONAL PROPERTY TRANSFERS AND THE IMPACT PROBLEM NINETEEN IS HAVING ON THEM. RETROACTIVELY ACTUALLY SO. LET ME GIVE YOU THE- FULL OF THE BILL AND THEN YES I DO HAVE PEOPLE ON THE LINE WHO WISH TO SUPPORT IT. IT WILL DELAY THE IMPLEMENTATION DATE OF PROPOSITION NINETEEN SPECIFICALLY THE PROPERTY TAX FAIRNESS FOR FAMILY HOME SECTION. BY CHANGING THE FEBRUARY SIXTEENTH TWENTY TWENTY ONE IMPLEMENTATION DATE TO FEBRUARY SIXTEENTH TWENTY TWENTY THREE. THAT GIVES A TWO YEAR OB TIME. IN WHICH TO WORK THROUGH SOME OF THESE VERY SIGNIFICANT ISSUES ARE THAT CURRENTLY EXIST WITH THAT. IN THE NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ELECTION- PROP NINETEEN REPEAL PROPOSITION FIFTY EIGHT. AND PROPOSITION NOT ONE NINETY THREE CHANGING THE RULES FOR TAX ASSESSMENTS ON PROPERTY TRANSFERRED WITHIN FAMILIES. PRIOR TO PROP PROPOSITION NINETEEN PARENTS OR GRANDPARENTS COULD TRANSFER PRIMARY RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES TO THEIR CHILDREN OR GRANDCHILDREN WITHOUT THE PROPERTY'S TAX ASSESSMENT. RESETTING TO MARKET VALUE OTHER TYPES OF PROPERTY SUCH AS VACATION HOMES FAMILY FARMS AND BUSINESS PROPERTIES COULD BE TRANSFERRED WITH THE FIRST TWO MILLION DOLLARS OF ASSESSED REASSESSMENT WHEN TRANSFERRED. PROPOSITION NINETEEN ELIMINATED THE PARENT TO CHILD AND GRANDPARENT TO GRANDCHILD EXEMPTION IN CASES WHERE THE CHILD OR GRANDCHILD DOES NOT USE THE INHERITED HOME AS THEIR PRINCIPAL RESIDENCE. THE MEASURE ALSO ELIMINATED THE MILLION DOLLAR EXEMPTION FOR OTHER PROPERTIES. PROPOSITION NINETEEN DID MAKE AN EXCEPTION ONLY FOR HOMES THAT THE CHILDREN MOVE INTO WITHIN ONE YEAR AND USES THEIR PRINCIPAL RESIDENCE HOWEVER AS WE ALL KNOW IT'S NOT ALWAYS POSSIBLE FOR FAMILY MEMBERS TO IMMEDIATELY RELOCATE. UNDER THIS NEW LAW CHILDREN COULD NOW BE FORCED BY HIGHER TAXES TO SELL THEIR FAMILY'S PROPERTY SUCH AS A SMALL BUSINESS THAT HAS PROVIDED THE FAMILY WITH FINANCIAL SECURITY. IN THEIR LONG TIME HOME IF THEY CAN'T MOVE IN FAST ENOUGH SINCE THE PROPOSITION WAS APPROVED A 51% OF THE VOTERS THERE HAVE BEEN CONCERNS FROM ASSESSORS. BOARD OF EQUALIZATION LAWYERS AND TAXPAYERS ON HOW BEST TO IMPLEMENT THE LARGEST CHAIN TO CALIFORNIA'S PROPERTY TAX SYSTEM SINCE PROP THIRTEEN IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT. A MAJOR OBSTACLE THAT TAXPAYERS HAVE FEES PRIOR TO AND SINCE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PROPOSITION NINETEEN AS TRANSFERRING THEIR PROPERTY DURING THE CALL THE NINETEEN. LITTLE PANDEMIC PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS HAVE BEEN HANDICAPPED IN THEIR ABILITY TO TRANSFER. THE GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS BEING CLOSED TO THE PUBLIC. TO PROVIDE MORE TIME FOR OUR TAXING. AGENCIES AND ARE AFFECTED TAXPAYERS HOMEOWNERS TO DEAL WITH THIS MAJOR CHANGE IN INTERGENERATIONAL PROPERTY TRANSFERS SB SIX SIXTY EIGHT WELL THE WAY THE IMPLEMENTATION FROM FEBRUARY SIXTEENTH TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO FEBRUARY SIXTEENTH TWENTY TWENTY THREE THIS DELAY. MAKES FOR AN APPROPRIATE EXTENSION LIKE HE MANY EXTENSIONS ARE STATE HAS ISSUED FOR STRUGGLING CALIFORNIANS ESPECIALLY DURING THIS GLOBAL PANDEMIC I WOULD LIKE TO THANK MEMBER TED GAINES WITH THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION AND SCOTT KAUFMAN AND HIM BE ABLE WITH HOWARD JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION WHO ARE HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU SO MUCH SUGAR BEET CIVIL WAR FIRST HERE FROM THE HONORABLE TAKE GAINS- FORMER SENATOR WANT TO SENATOR ALWAYS A SENATOR HARDWORKING NEIGHBOR THE STATE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION NOW.

AND I'LL GIVE YOU THIRTY SECOND PROMPT. FANTASTIC THANK YOU VERY MUCH SURE WHAT WERE PRECEDED THIS. OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK AS A- FORMER STATE SENATOR AND I CORPS CURRENT MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION- THAT'S OF MANY RESPONSIBILITIES AT THE PORT I'M ONE OF THOSE IS PROVIDING GUIDANCE TO ASSESSORS. UNIFORMITY IN PROPERTY ASSESSMENTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT WE SEEK TO ENSURE FAIRNESS CLARITY IN PROPERTY TAX ADMINISTRATION THAT IS WHY I'M PLEASED TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF SENATE BILL SIX SIXTY EIGHT THE BUILDING THIS TAXPAYERS MORE REASONABLE TIMELINE TO UNDERSTAND THE CHANGES BROUGHT FORTH BY PROP NINETEEN AT TO USE THAT KNOWLEDGE IN THE PROPERTY. TAX TRANSFERS. AS IT STANDS. BUT THE CHILD IN GRAND TO CREATE EXCLUSION- THOSE CHANGES ARE POORLY UNDERSTOOD AND LEAVE MANY QUESTIONS UNANSWERED MY OFFICE IN THE BOARD RECEIVED COUNCIL'S CATALYST ENQUIRING REGARDING SPECIFIC QUESTIONS SURROUNDING HOW THE NEW RICH BENEFACTORS PROPERTIES IN TRUCKS MY RESIDENCE REQUIREMENTS FINDING A FRACTIONAL OWNERSHIP AND MANY OTHER QUESTIONS TOO MANY OF THESE QUESTIONS. THAT REMAIN UNRESOLVED. SINCE THE- NINETEEN. OR WE CAN OVER A HUNDRED TWENTY TWENTY THOUSAND ON OUR WEBSITE SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO CURRENT NINETEEN HI WE ARE WORKING TO CLARIFY AS MUCH AS WE CAN AND DO SO AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN BUT THERE ARE SO MANY FAMILIES WHO DID NOT GET HACKED BEFORE THE. GREAT SIX NEEDS THE DEADLINE. IT'S NOT EVEN BEEN AWAY OF THESE CHANGES. HOUSES ALSO THE FAMILY'S BIGGEST ASSET WE NEED TO PROVIDE A LONGER LEAD TIME. FOR EVERYONE TO COMPLY WITH THE MANDATE OF THE NEW LAW. NOT JUST THOSE WEALTHIEST SOPHISTICATED MAPS HAVE A TAX ATTORNEY OR FINANCIAL PLANNER ON SPEED DIAL. NUMBER AND THAT IS SOMETHING ELSE THAT WE WANT TO KNOW ABOUT PROP NINETEEN WAS SOLD. AS A WAY OF CLOSING LOOPHOLES ON CROSS FRONT ERRORS EAST COAST INVESTORS AND HOLY BUT FOR WHATEVER NEDS. BUT THAT IS NOT WHAT WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING AT THE KIA WE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE REACHING OUT TO US- WORRIED AND CONFUSED AND THEY'RE JUST MIDDLE CLASS FOLKS. ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM. SO YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN WE WITH- WHAT CHAMBLEE SAP. INDIVIDUALS WHO THANKS THAT THE IT WORKED ALL THEIR LIVES THE FILM STAR HOME. TO LEAVE AT FOR THEIR CHILDREN- SISTER DISABLED ADULTS WHO WANT TO USE RENTAL INCOME TO HELP COVER THEIR CHILD'S LIVING EXPENSES AFTER THEY PASS AWAY. THEY'VE BEEN BLINDSIDED BY PROP NINETEEN SIMPLY NEED MORE TIME TO MAKE PLANS THIRTY SECONDS IS BILL IS NOT ABOUT I'M DOING THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE. BUT IMPLEMENTED DRAMATIC CHANGES IN A WAY THAT RESPECTS THE COMPLEXITY. AND IMPORTANCE. MUST MAKE ABOUT THE- FUTURE. THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY SPEECH YET TODAY I WANT TO THANK SENATOR BATES. ACTING QUICKLY TO HELP TAXPAYERS STRUGGLING TO COMPILE TO COMPLY WITH THE EFFECTS OF PROP NINETEEN. AND PLEASE NOTE THE BOARD HAS NOT TAKEN A POSITION. ON THIS LEGISLATION I'M SPEAKING ON MY OWN BEHALF. AND I ENCOURAGE YOU TO SUPPORT SENATE BILL SIX SIXTY EIGHT. CHOIR THANK YOU MUCH. SHARING THESE DISCUSSIONS- WITH SENATOR HERTZBERG YOURSELF. TO SEE IF WE CAN COME TO A REMEDY THAT PROVIDES SOME RELIEF AFTER THOSE TWO- ARE STRUGGLING I NEED IT. IF WE- LOOK. AT THE WHOLE. IT WOULD APPEAR THAT OBAMA THE MORE YOU ARE SPREADSHEET FOR RETIREMENT OR PASSING ON. FILE OPEN SOME SOME JUST GOT CAUGHT IN THE SHOPS. THAT NOBODY OF THE PROPOSITION THAT. I PROCEEDED CENTER ITSELF AND YOUR HELP AND- MOVING THIS FORWARD THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU MR SENATOR VERY GRATEFUL- THAT BOARD OF EQUALIZATION. MEMBER MISTER TED GAINES ALSO A FORMER ENATOR HERE IN THE STATE SNATE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SENATOR IN ALWAYS WONDERFUL TO HEAR YOUR VOICE AND PLEASE GIVE OUR BEST THE BEST AS WELL ALL RIGHT BUT WE ARE NOW GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO MISTER KAUFMAN REPRESENTING THE HOWARD DRIVERS JERVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION. BUT MR COPPING YOU KNOW THREE MINUTES AND I'LL GIVE YOU THIRTY SECOND PROBLEM PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOU I BELIEVE MR GAINS ELOQUENTLY EXPRESSED THE NEED FOR THIS BILL SO IF THE CHAIR WOULD ALLOW I WOULD LIKE TO YIELD MY TIME TO MY ASSOCIATE HERE TEN BATTLE BECAUSE I THINK HE'S BETTER TO SPEAK TO THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF THE COMMITTEE MAY HAVE CONCERNS WITH THAT'S OKAY WITH YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH YES THE TURN IT OVER TO MR BIDDLE MISCIBILITY OF THREE MINUTES. AND I'LL GIVE YOU THIRTY SECOND PROMPT GOOD. AFTERNOON THIS CHAIR- THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS FOR A P. SIX SIX. RAISED THE CALL. POSED BY THE BILL'S OPPONENTS. WHETHER S. P. SIX SIX EIGHT CONFLICTS WITH PROPOSITION NINETEEN. IT DOES NOT. PROPOSITION NINETEEN DID NOTHING MORE THAN SCALE DOWN THE INHERITANCE EXCLUSION THAT IS CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED HE DID NOT SAY THAT EVERYONE ELSE MUST BE TAXED. IF A SPECIFIED CONSTITUTIONAL EXCLUSION WERE INTERPRETED AS A REQUIREMENT THAT EVERYONE ELSE MUST BE TAXED. IN THE SPECIFIED EXCLUSION FOR TRANSFERS BETWEEN SPOUSES WOULD MAN THE DOMESTIC PARTNERS MUST BE TAXED. BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT THE COURTRULED IN STRONG VERSUS BOARD OF EQUALIZATION THE COURT RULED THAT A VOTER APPROVED CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTION FOR ONE GROUP DOES NOT PROHIBIT THE LEGISLATURE FROM STATUTORILY PROTECTING OTHER GROUPS OR SITUATIONS SUCH AS DOMESTIC PARTNERS. EXAMPLES OF THE LEGISLATURE DOING JUST THAT ABOUND. ARTICLE THIRTEEN SECTIONS THREE FOUR SEVEN AND EIGHT LIST ALL OF THE CATEGORIES OF PROPERTY THAT ARE EXEMPT FROM TAXATION UNDER THE CONSTITUTION FOR EXAMPLE PUBLIC PROPERTY CHURCHES HOSPITALS SCHOOLS ET CETERA BUT THE LEGISLATURE IN THE REVENUE AND TAXATION CODE. HAS ADDED SEVERAL EXEMPTIONS NOT MENTIONED IN THE CONSTITUTION INCLUDING VETERANS ORGANIZATIONS VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENTS NONPROFIT SCIENCE LABS AND NONPROFIT BOOKSTORES. CHANGE IN OWNERSHIP IS A TERM DEFINED BY THE LEGISLATURE IN STATUTE IT ALWAYS HAS BEEN. OPPOSITION NINETEEN DID NOT TAKE THAT AWAY OR PROHIBIT THE LEGISLATURE FROM CREATING ADDITIONAL EXCLUSIONS FROM ITS DEFINITION. AND IT'S NOT SURPRISING THAT PROP NINETEEN PUT NO LIMITS ON THE LEGISLATURE SINCE PROP NINETEEN WAS A PRODUCT OF THE LEGISLATURE. IT WAS YOUR OWN ACA ELEVEN YOU DID NOT TIE YOUR OWN HANDS ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY SUGGESTED BY THE BILL'S OPPONENTS IS SIMPLY MISTAKEN. HOWEVER IF THE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE STAFF PREFER AMENDMENTS OR A DIFFERENT APPROACH WE ARE HAPPY TO COOPERATE. I CAN MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND FOR WHAT WE WERE GOING TO COME IN ON THAT HERE IN JUST A MOMENT REALLY GRATEFUL FOR THAT THE PRESENTATION TODAY THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US SIR.

SIX DEFECTIVE WE DELAY THE INTERGENERATIONAL PROVISIONS N PROPOSITION NINETEEN BY REDEFINING THE CHANGE IN OWNERSHIP EXCLUSION. I THINK SIX SIX EIGHT PICKS AND CHOOSES WHICH PROVISION SHOULD ADHERE TO THE EFFECTIVE. DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION OF PROPOSITION NINETEEN. BUT DELAYED EFFECTIVE DATE HOWEVER IT'S INCONSISTENT WITH THE EXPRESS LANGUAGE OF PROPOSITION NINETEEN WHICH IS INCLUDED IN THE STATE CONSTITUTION. CALIFORNIA COURTS HAVE HELD THAT THE VOTERS SHOULD GET WHAT THEY ENACTED NOT MORE AND NOT LESS. IN DECIDING WHETHER A PARTICULAR STATUTORY PROVISION AMENDING AN INITIATIVE CAN GO FORWARD. THE COURTS HAVE HELD THE QUESTION WHETHER IT PROHIBITS WHAT THE INITIATIVE AUTHORIZES. OR AUTHOR I DID WITH THE INITIATIVE PROHIBIT IN THIS CASE WE FIND. THAT AT LEAST SIX SIX EIGHT. DIRECTLY ACROSS. THE BUT THE VOTERS ARE. IN SOME THIRTY SIX SIX EIGHT SIX THE CIRCUMVENT THE WILL OF THE VOTERS AND ANY SUCH AMENDMENT TO PROPOSITION NINETEEN MUST BE SUBMITTED TO THE VOTERS FOR APPROVAL EXACTLY A CALIFORNIA BEGINS TO BRIEF ITSELF FOR WHAT HAD RECENTLY BEEN COINED A TRIPLE THREAT BOB FIRES WITHIN THE RESOURCES PROVIDED UNDER PROPOSITION NINETEEN WILL BE OF GREAT ASSISTANCE IN DEFENDING THE MUCH NEEDED HOUSING INVENTORY FROM RESIDENTS MOST VULNERABLE IN THE BONFIRE EVENT.

ISSUE AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND GET JUST WANNA TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY THANK YOU SO MUCH AND- BAITS FOR YOUR- YOUR FOCUS ON THIS. WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO SEE IF THERE ARE QUESTIONS CONCERNS FROM COMMITTEE. PLEASE MISTER VICE CHAIR AND THIS IS A PRESENTATION ONLY TODAY MISTER VICE CHAIR. YEAH MR CHAIRMAN I'D LIKE TO- INQUIRE OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM ORANGE COUNTY IF ONE OF OUR WITNESSES COULD EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THIS OWNERSHIP TRANSFER ISSUE AND IF THE PROPERTY I'M SORRY MR VICE CHAIR WHERE TO START THE NEW POP IT DOESN'T TRANSFER WITHIN THREE YEARS- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN EIGHTY NINE POINT 9% AND THEN IT GOES NOT WITHIN THREE YEARS AS IT DID THERE SEEMS TO BE THERE'S SOME CONFUSION THERE AT LEAST THERE WAS ON MY PART. GOOD MAYBE. ONE OF OUR WITNESSES TALK WITH US ABOUT THAT A BIT. WITH THE WONDER THAT DESERVE. TRAN I BELIEVE. THIS REPRESENTS A BIG IMPORTANT ISSUE IN THIS IN THIS WHOLE ISSUE. E. III I BELIEVE THAT MAYBE OUR NEXT. BILL THE NEXT BILL YES OKAY YEAH I JUST DON'T WANT THAT TO SLIP BY NO NO YOU'RE ACTUALLY RIGHT MR MAJOR COULDN'T REACH YOU MORE ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. SO LOOK I. I THINK THAT- A COUPLE OF ITEMS. BUT WE WILL TO AVOID IS HAVE. I DON'T WHERE YOU POINT ME ALL YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO WORK FOR POINT. OKAY SIR WINNER. THE REDDIT. I YOU KNOW WHATEVER IT IS DUE TO WANT TO CALM AND THE CONCERN- THAT THAT THE PLAN OF THE BILL OR EXPRESSING BUT I DO WANT TO SAY THAT IN TERMS OF PUTTING ASIDE WHETHER WE CAN CONSTITUTIONALLY DO THIS I KNOW THAT IS A REAL REAL ISSUE I KNOW THIS DEBATE OVER THAT JUST IN TERMS OF ON THE POLICY WITH THE VOTERS WERE VOTING ON THERE WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE MYSELF INCLUDED. WHO DID NOT SUPPORT THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF PROP NINETEEN FROM A COUPLE YEARS BEFORE BECAUSE IT WAS ALL IT DID WAS ALLOW PEOPLE TO BUY AND SELL AND TRANSFER THEIR BASES TO ANOTHER COUNTY EVEN THOUGH THE ACCOUNT WAS IMPETUS. WHITE BALANCE THAT AL IMPROV NINETEEN WHY SOME OF US WERE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT- WAS BECAUSE IT ADDRESSED THE ISSUE OF SOMEONE IN HER READING. BASICALLY UP HOME FROM THEIR PARENTS AND NOT LIVING AT RENTING IT OUT USING IT AS AN INCOME PROPERTY AND STILL BEING ABLE TO HAVE THE FULL PROP THIRTEEN PROTECTION WHICH WAS NEVER THE INTENT FOR PEOPLE TO GET PROP THIRTEEN PROTECTION EVEN THOUGH THAT ALL LIVING IN A HOME. AND SO PUTTING ASIDE THE CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES THIS RAISES REAL ISSUES OF THE VOTERS VOTED ON THIS I THINK WITH A CERTAIN UNDERSTANDING ANNA AND I THINK WE SHOULD BE VERY HESITANT TO CHANGE OUT WITH US SAID I KNOW THE CHAIR AND CENTER HERTZBERG SAID. WE'LL BE WORKING ON THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU SO MUCH- SIR WE ARE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THOSE COMMENTS ANYONE ELSE FROM COMMITTEE. ALL RIGHT I'M GONNA TURN IT OVER TO SENATOR BATES FOR CLOSE TO THE ONE ITEM IS. THIS CAN BE VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT CENTER WE KNEW WAS GOING TO SAY THAT ONE- I THINK THAT THERE IS AREAS THAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO. LOOK AT CLEANING UP I KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME OTHER AREAS IT CENTER BATES WILL WANT TO BE ABLE TO EXPLORE- I THINK THE CHALLENGE WITH WHAT WAS CURRENTLY IN FRONT OF US TODAY WAS THAT THE CONCERNED ABOUT HAVING TWO SETS OF LAWS ON THE BOOKS ONE THAT IS A CONSTITUTIONAL. MANDATE THE OTHER IS A STATUTE PASSED BY THE LEGISLATURE- IN THE CONFUSION THAT THAT THAT THAT WOULD BRING IN REGARDS TO ASSESSORS ABORTED EQUALIZATION AND THAT THERE IS A COMMITMENT TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH SENATOR BATES MY EXACT WORDS THE CENTER BASED IN PLACE FOR TRACKING USER BASES- WE'LL SEND IN. A REQUEST HERE STARTING NEXT WEEK TO BE ABLE TO START GETTING THE DATE ON THE CALENDAR TO BE ABLE TO BEGIN TO TALK ABOUT THIS AND THE REASON WHY WE HAVE ADVANCED- THE INVITATION TO SENATOR HERTZBERG CENTERS FOR IS ALSO BEEN VERY INTERESTED IN LOOKING AT- AREAS WITHIN PROP NINETEEN HE WAS VERY FOCUSED ON IT LAST YEAR AS WELL- AND THINK IT WOULD BE FRUITFUL DISCUSSION. I AM VERY GRATEFUL TO THE- GOOD CENTER CENTER BAITS FOR THE WILLINGNESS TO BE ABLE TO ENGAGE IN THAT AND OBVIOUSLY WE'LL BE ENGAGING IN THE COALITION THAT SHE'S BRINGING FORWARD AS WELL SO THIS IS A PATIENT AT PRESENTATION ONLY BUT I'D LIKE TO BE TO. GIVE THE LAST WORD TO SENATOR BATES FOR CLOSING AGAIN SIR BATES THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR ON GOING WILLINGNESS TO WORK ON THIS ISSUE CELEBRATES AFTER THE CLOSE. I THANK YOU CHAIRMAN CHOIR AND CERTAINLY I THANK YOU FOR THOSE WHO SPOKE ENOUGH SUPPORT IN THOSE WHO SPOKE IN OPPOSITION I THINK THE MOST UP FUNDAMENTAL DISCUSSION THAT HAS TO GO FORWARD WITH- YOUR COMMITMENT THAT WE WILL. CONVENE A WORKING GROUP A STAKEHOLDER GROUP- IF YOU WILL- TO EXPLORE. THE ISSUES REGARDING I THINK WHAT MR BIDDLE BROUGHT TO THE DISCUSSION THE QUESTION OF CONSTITUTIONAL CONFLICTS ARE. THAT THE BILL IN ITS CURRENT FORMED- PRESENT HE CITED LEGAL AUTHORITY THAT CHANNEL. THE NOTION. DELAYING AND- RUNS AFOUL. THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTION OF. PROP NINETEEN AND- I'M NOT GOING TO GET INTO THE DEBATE OF WHY I DON'T AGREE WITH THAT BECAUSE WE'RE NOT REPEALING IT. WE'RE GIVING AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE ON. ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ISSUE ARE TAX AGENCIES THAT ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE AFFECTED AND THAT'S ACROSS THE BOARD. HOW TO. FIND A RESOLUTION ABOUT SO- WE GOTTA ROLL UP OUR SLEEVES TAKE A- HARD SHOT AT IT AND- HOPEFULLY. WE WILL GET TO THAT IN A PERFECT SPOT TO REBALANCE SAID DAN AND TO. REFLECT WHAT THE VOTERS VOTED ON- WITH PROP NINETEEN POUNDS HOPEFULLY I'LL- THAT'LL RESOLVE IT ON ALL FRONTS I WILL MENTION THAT A CONSTITUENT OF MINE SPENT. TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. A VERY- SINGLE MOM. SHE IS A REALTOR AND SHE- WAS SO QUITE FRIGHTENED WITH WHAT WAS HAPPENING BECAUSE THAT PARTICULAR PROPERTY THAT SHE ALWAYS HAS BEEN A MAINSTAY. HI IN HER LIFE FOUR. AS A RENTAL AND CERTAINLY PASSING TO OUR CHILDREN. WHO ARE IN A SIMILAR SITUATION SO. THAT THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT ISSUES AND I THINK WE CAN ADDRESS THOSE WITH OUR GROUP. SO WITH THAT. THANK YOU AND- WE CAN. WE ON TO MY- IF WE HAVE TO BUILD IF BASED YOU HAVE A WAY YOU WOULD LIKE TO DO TO MASSAGES- YES MA'AM THANK YOU MUCH WE'RE NOT GONNA BE MOVING ON ITEM EIGHTEEN SP SEVEN OH SIX OF FLORES YOUR CENTER BATES THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU- FIND ME. TALKING POINTS HERE. SO MY SECOND BILL IS AND IT STARTED WITH GOOD MORNING BUT I THINK- WE'VE KIND OF PASS THERE HAVEN'T WE- THANK YOU GUYS FOR HANGING IN THERE. R. S. B. SEVEN OH SIX CLARIFIES THAT A CHANGE OF CONTROL IN A CORPORATE ENTITY OCCURS IF 90% OF THE OWNERSHIP INTERESTS IN THAT ENTITY. CHANGES HANDS WITH THE WITHIN ANY THREE YEAR PERIOD. EVEN IF NO ONE PERSON GETS A MAJORITY INTEREST IN THE LEGAL ENTITY. THIS CHANGING CONTROL WOULD TRIGGER A CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP AND REASSESSMENT OF THE CORPORATIONS REAL PROPERTY. FOR PROPERTY TAX PURPOSES. CURRENTLY PROPOSITION THIRTEEN OF NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT ENSURES THAT PROPERTY TAXES DO NOT GET OUT OF CONTROL. FOR ANY CALIFORNIA HOMEOWNER OR BUSINESS HOWEVER THERE IS AN ANTI GUY AMBIGUITY IN. IT THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED A PRIME EXAMPLE IS THE TWO THOUSAND SIX PURCHASE OF A HOTEL IN SANTA MONICA. WHERE THE PURCHASER AND REALIZED HE COULD STRUCTURE. THE TRANSACTION WITH THE POWER TO ANY ONE ENTITY OWNING A 50% MAJORITY SHARE IN THE PROPERTY. DESPITE THE FACT THAT 100% OF THE OWNERSHIP OF THE HOTEL. DID CHANGE HANDS THE PROPERTY WAS NOT REASSESS. RESULTING IN A TAX LOSS TO LOS ANGELES COUNTY. OF OVER A MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. YES B. SEVEN OH SIX WOULD INSTEAD. SAY THAT A CHANGE IN OWNERSHIP OCCURS WHEN OWNERSHIP INTEREST TRANSFERS IN A SINGLE. TRANSACTION IN THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION ANALYSIS OF SP THIRTEEN NINETEEN WHICH WAS MY BILL LAST YEAR. THAT WAS IDENTICAL TO THIS BILL IT WAS ESTIMATED THAT THE ANNUAL REVENUE GAINS. COULD AMOUNT TO ABOUT. THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE STATE. THIS IS SIGNIFICANT A SIMILAR BILL SB TWO FIFTY NINE. WHICH I AUTHORED IN TWENTY FIFTEEN DID PASS OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE- SIX TWO ZERO ZERO. THAT BILL WOULD HAVE ALSO TRIGGERED REASSESSMENT WHEN 90% OF THE DIRECTOR INDIRECT OWNERSHIP INTERESTS TRANSFER IN A SINGLE. PLANT TRANSACTION IN A THREE YEAR PERIOD. YES B. SEVEN OH SIX DOES NOT FROM THIRTEEN. SIMPLY JUST HOW IT IS INTERPRETED IN STATUTE. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK ERIC MESQUITE WITH THE CALIFORNIA BUSINESS ROUNDTABLE AND SCOTT KAUFMAN WITH THE HOWARD JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION. WHO ARE HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU SO MUCH INNERVATES ALRIGHT SO LAZY GENERAL GONNA GO TO OUR LIVE TELECONFERENCE LINE WE'RE GONNA START WITH THAT ERICA MAY KEEP THE CALIFORNIA BUSINESS ROUNDTABLE. MR MACKEY YOU ARE THREE MINUTES I'LL GIVE YOU THIRTY SECOND PROMPT THE FLOOR IS YOURS SIR YOU'RE NOW IN COMMITTEE PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS ERIC MINSKY REPRESENTING THE BUSINESS ROUNDTABLE SUPPORT AT THE SEVEN OF THE- AT THE TURN OF THE WELL THOUGHT OUT CAREFULLY BALANCED MEASURE TO ADDRESS THE TAX PLANNING OPPORTUNITY THAT HAS TURNED INTO A POTENTIAL FOR ABUSE. OCT THIRTEEN PROPERTIES ONLY WE GET THAT UPON A CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP. UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW CORPORATION SEPARATE LEGAL IDENTITIES FROM THEIR SHAREHOLDERS AND CAN OWN PROPERTY IN THEIR OWN MINI. FIRSTLY THE AVERAGE SHAREHOLDER HAS NO RIGHT TO DEATH OCCUPIED OR DISPOSE OF PROPERTY. IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT THEN IT FEEDS THEM ARGUE PROP THIRTEEN SHOULD ONLY RESET THE CORPORATE OWNED PROPERTY WHEN THE CORPORATION ITSELF SOLD THAT PROPERTY TO AN UNRELATED PERSON OR ENTITY. AND NOT WHEN THE OWNERSHIP INTEREST MY CORPORATION TRANSFERRED AND YOU KNOW THAT WAS ACTUALLY A RECOMMENDATION OF THE ORIGINAL PASSPORT WHO- THAT WAS FORMED UNDER THE AUSPICES. OF THE ASSEMBLY REVENUE TAX COMMITTEE AFTER PROP THIRTEEN PASSED THAT TEST SCORES. BUT WHEN THE LEGISLATURE ADOPTED IMPLEMENTING LEGISLATION NOR THAT SEPARATE ENTITY RECOMMENDATION AND BREAK STRUCTURE WE HAVE TODAY AND TODAY IS 50% OF THE OWNERSHIP INTERESTS OF THE BATH IN A SINGLE PERSON OR ENTITY THE ULTIMATE CONTROL THAT AND HE IS BEING TRANSFERRED. AND THAT NEW MAJORITY INTEREST HOLDER CONTENT TERMING THE DISPOSITION OF CORPORATE PROPERTY WAS ALSO- BEING TO BE A CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP OF THAT CORPORATE PROPERTY BUT IT'S WITH THE LIMITED FICTION THAT WAS ACTUALLY NOT THE PROP THIRTEEN FORTY. BUT WITH THE DOCTOR THE LEGISLATURE BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT IT WOULD BOUNCE THE RELATIVE TAX BURDEN TO BUSINESSES. AND RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY. BUT IT BECAME- A OPPORTUNE FOR SURE ATTACKS PLANNERS WHEN THE REAL THEY COULD TRANSFER ALL THE- AND- THREE THREE THREE. ENTITIES KEEPING EACH OF THE TRANSFEREE OWNERSHIP INTEREST BELOW FIFTY PERCENT. AND COULD AFFECT WE SELL PROPERTY WITHOUT CAUSING THE CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP. AND REINVESTMENT OF THE PROPERTY. OF THE- PLANNING OPPORTUNITY. BECAME AN ALL CONTEMPT THE POTENTIAL FOR ABUSE. AND THAT'S WHAT THE READER- BIG MENTION THE OCEAN AVENUE LLC CASE INVOLVING- THE MICHAEL DELL TRANSACTION. THAT WOULD BE SO BY- FIFTY SEVEN OF THE- THAT'S WHAT THE BILL WOULD- I WOULD LIKE TO RESPOND BRIEFLY TO JUST ONE OF THE CONCERNS RAISED BY THE OPPONENT. THE COMPANY THAT THE GOVERNMENT PICKED LOWERS THE EXISTING STANDARD FOR CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP BECAUSE THE PARTS FROM THE CURRENT 50% STANDARD IN EXISTING LAW. BUT THAT THE MISUNDERSTANDING OF CURRENT LAW. UNDER CURRENT LAW A CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP OF A CORPORATE ON PROPERTY OCCURS WHEN A PERSON THE PAIN CONTROL OF MORE THAN 50% OF THE VOTING STOCK OF SELLING AND IT. SO UNDER LAW THE BILLING ENTITY SO TRIGGERING A CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP SO LONG AS NO ONE PERSON. PHONE TOWARD THE OF THE BUYER'S PHONE FOR THAN 50% OF THE STOCK. THAT'S WHAT CREATES THE PROBLEM IN FACT FIFTY SEVEN OH SIX RAMAGE. THIRTY SECOND SEVEN OF THE FIRST. SURE AT OH SIX THE FIRST. FOCUSES ON WHAT ITS SOUL AND IT'S NOT WHAT IT'S UNDER CONTROL FIVE SINGLE PURCHASER. FOR THE QUOTE. BUT I THINK THE REASON MEASURED APPROACH THAT WOULD ELIMINATE POTENTIAL COULD BE USE. AND GLADLY RAISE MUCH NEEDED REVENUE FOR SCHOOLS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AROUND PEOPLE STRONGLY RECOMMEND THE INDOOR TWO. THIRTY SEVEN OF IFTY BANKS IN A DEBATE FOR SPONSORSHIP AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE MAY HAVE SEX WITH HIM. THANK YOU SO MUCH JUST TO MAKE A VERY GATEFUL AND THEY SING GERMAN WE'RE NOT GONNA BE GOING TO THE MAN WHO HAS BEEN HERE FROM THE BEGINNING THAT HIS NAME IS SCOTT KAUFMAN FROM THE HOWARD JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION. SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OF SB. SEVEN OH SIX MISTER COFFIN. BEING HERE ALL DAY SIR PUTS. INTO PERSPECTIVE THE WORK YOU ALL DO SO THANK YOU FOR LET ME SPEAK TO YOU AGAIN- CURRENT LAW ALLOWS FOR PROPERTY TO BE REASSESSED WHEN IT IS SOLD HOWEVER IF THE PROPERTY IS OWNED BY MULTIPLE PEOPLE OR- INTERPRETATION WHAT QUALIFIES AS CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP HAS SOMETIMES BEEN EXPLOITED. IN A MANNER INCONSISTENT WITH PROPOSITION THIRTEEN. THIS OCCURS WHEN INDIVIDUALS USE COMPLEX REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS TO AVOID REASSESSMENT EVEN. WHEN FAR MORE THAN 50% OF OWNERSHIP INTERESTS HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED. IT HAS THE EFFECT OF CROSSING THE STATE LOCAL MINUTES MUNICIPALITIES TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN LOST REVENUE. FOR THE HOWARD JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION HAS ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT ANYONE. INDIVIDUAL OR BUSINESS SHOULD PAY THE PROPERTY TAXES THEY LEGITIMATELY- IF THE LAW IS BEING ABUSED IN SUCH A WAY THAT LEADS TO UNFAIR TAX POLICY IT SHOULD BE CORRECTED. WILL CURB OF USEFUL GENERATING MILLIONS IN NEW REVENUE WITHOUT RAISING TAXES FOR ALL THREE PROPOSITION THIRTEEN. INSTEAD OF PLAIN BALLOT MEASURE POLITICS OF THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. LET'S PASS THIS BILL TO PROVIDE TAX FAIRNESS FOR ALL COMMERCIAL PROPERTY OWNERS. WE ASK THAT YOU SUPPORT SB.

CHECK IN WITH OUR LEAD OPPOSITION WITNESS- OUR LEAD OPPOSITION WHEN THIS IS LENNY GOLDBERG FROM THE CALIFORNIA TAX REFORM ASSOCIATION MR GOLDBERG THREE MINUTES I'LL GIVE OU A THIRTY SECOND PROMPT. THE FLOOR IS NOW YOURS IN OPPOSITION OF SB SEVEN OH SIX. THANK YOU SENATOR MCGUIRE GOOD HERE IT'LL BE TWO YEARS. BILL NOT ONLY DOESN'T CLOSE THE LOOPHOLE AND THE ABUSES THAT THE PROPONENTS WERE TALKING ABOUT BUT IT MAKES THINGS WORSE- THE FIRST THING IS THAT WE INTRODUCED A BILL LIKE THIS. MANY YEARS AGO AND THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY SAID THIS IS WHAT ROLE WE CAN'T GO FOR A WEE ASPIRIN CANCER TUMORS A LOOK AT THE PROBLEMS IN CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP. AND THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY SAID WE CAN'T GO FOR THAT THAT'S- THE FACT IS THAT NOT ONLY IS THIS. LITTLE CONTINUES BECAUSE WITH THE THREE YEAR PERIOD YOU CAN SELL 1989% OF YOUR PROPERTY AND WHEN THE THREE YEAR AND YOU BUT IT ADDS A NEW. PIECE OF LAW WHICH SAYS THAT THE STOCK TRANSMITTERS DON'T COUNT AS CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP WE KNOW THAT LARGE CORPORATIONS ARE PAYING AMONG THE LOWEST PROPERTY TAXES THEY CHANGED OWNERSHIP YEARS AND YEARS. BUT HAVE NEVER BEEN THE SS NOW THE HISTORY ON THIS IS THAT SENATOR CLINTON COP IN THE NINETIES AND SENATORS KIA MARCUS YES IN THE ARTS SAID LET'S TAKE THE STANDARD IN MAMA. 50% SALANDER AND MAKE IT CLEAR MILITANTS AND AS SOON AS YOU MAKE IT A CUMULATIVE SALANDER MUCH OF THIS ONE CALL IS GONE THAT'S NOT TO SAY THE CLOSELY HELD BUSINESSES CAN LAST YOU WILL GO ON FOREVER. WITHOUT BEING BSS BUT IF YOU ALLOW FOR A CUMULATIVE 50% STANDARD AT LEAST- LOOPHOLE SAYS WHEN CHANGING OWNERSHIP OCCURS AS DEFINED IN LAW AT FIFTY PLUS ONE PERCENT. THAT WOULD BE A CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP GENERATE UNION SAYS. BUT WHAT IS WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS PRETEND BECAUSE THERE'S A CHALLENGE. TO THE AS YOU KNOW WHEN PROP FIFTEEN AND WAY. A BIG CHALLENGE TO REFORM THIS THAT IS BROKEN INTO WORK IN SOME OF WHOM PAUL. BUT THE INTENT HERE IS TO PUT LIPSTICK ON A PIG BASED. BASICALLY TO SAY- WE'VE CLOSED THIS. NOW YOU KNOW MARGIE YOUR GIVE. NOW MARCH OLD GALA DAYS ALL THESE YEARS MANY OF THESE ACCOUNT TRANSACTIONS OCCUR ALL THE TIME AND THE NOTION THAT THIS BILL WILL PUT AN END TO THE ABUSES IS ON ITS FACE THE ABSURD BECAUSE YOU CAN EASILY SEE.

THAT A SOME BUT IT'S- LOT BETTER YOU CAN DO SOMETHING BUT THIS BILL DOES NOTHING AND MAKES IT WORSE BY EXEMPTING PUBLICLY TRADED CORPORATIONS AND SHARES IN STOCK JUST YET HE NOT WITHSTANDING- IT IS WORSE THAN CURRENT LAW.

THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER MODERATOR HAS BEEN WORKING HARD TODAY SO THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER MODERATOR WE ARE GOING TO RIGHT NOW BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE DC POLICE CENTER WINNER. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN I BUT YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE WHAT THE AUTHOR IS YOU KNOW TRYING TO DO BUT I- I DON'T SUPPORT- THIS BILL- UNITING THE ULTIMATE SOLUTION WOULD BE- TO NOT HAVE LARGE COMMERCIAL PROPERTY- INCLUDED IN PROP THIRTEEN AT ALL I- YOU KNOW I THINK ONE OF THE OWNERS. I WAS NOT HERE IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT SO- CENTER NO THINKING CORRECT ME IF I'M IF I'M WRONG ALTHOUGH MY UNDERSTANDING IS- WHEN PEOPLE IN THE CAMPAIGN FOR. PROP THIRTEEN WAS ABOUT PEOPLE'S HOMES- AND PEOPLE NOT LOSING THEIR HOMES ESPECIALLY PEOPLE ON FIXED INCOMES. AND THE FACT THAT LARGE YOU KNOW THESE. BUILDINGS IN DOWNTOWN SAN FRANCISCO OUR DOWNTOWN LA IS HIGH RISES- OR DISNEYLAND'S- OR ARE OR OR THE GOOGLE CAMPUS OR INCLUDED A PROP THIRTEEN IS OUR YOU KNOW HONESTLY IS ABSURD. AND THE FACT THAT YOU CAN EFFECTIVELY SELL PROPERTY- AND COMMERCIAL PROPERTY AND NOT HAVE A REASSESSMENT OF THE EXERCISE INSULT TO INJURY BECAUSE OF COURSE PEOPLE CAN'T DO THAT WITH OUR HOME- I THINK THAT THERE. COULD BE A WAY TO CLOSE A LOOPHOLE OR SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE IT LEGISLATIVELY- I DON'T THINK THAT THIS PROPOSAL REALLY DOES THAT EFFECTIVELY HAS TWO MAIN EXCLUSIONS THE 90% THRESHOLD IS TOO HIGH. AND IT DOES THIS IF WE WERE TO PASS THIS LEGISLATION IT COULD CREATE AN ACCURATE PERCEPTION THAT WOULD SOMEHOW SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. AND THEN TAKE MOMENTUM AWAY FROM EFFORTS TO ACTUALLY SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. SO WHILE I APPRECIATE WHAT THE AUTHOR IS TRYING TO DO I DON'T THINK IT CUTS US THERE- AND SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS. THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATOR WIENER WOULD LIKE TO GO TO SEE IF WE HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS COMMENTS MR MEISTER DID YOU WANT TO CHIME IN ON THIS. YEAH PLEASE RESERVATION. D. O. N. THANK YOU SO MUCH- SO THE VICE CHAIR IS MOVED THE BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SO- BEFORE WE TURN IT OVER TO SENATOR BATES I JUST WANT TO SAY FIRST AND FOREMOST- GRATEFUL TO ALWAYS WORK WITH SENATOR BATES TRULY- LOOK THIS IS THE FOURTH TIME THAT THE GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE COMMITTEE HAS HEARD THIS MEASURE. ADEN THE CENTRE BATES AND I. E. A. R. TEAM HAD SOME CONVERSATION ABOUT POTENTIAL COMPROMISE. AMENDMENTS UNFORTUNATELY WE- WEREN'T ABLE TO GET THERE ON THOSE AND THEN MENTION THE NAME IS WHAT IT DELETED THAT. THREE YEAR WINDOW SET BY THE BILL SO- WHENEVER OF A LEGAL ENTITY CHANGED. IT WOULD HAVE TRIGGERED THAT REASSESSMENT OF THE PROPERTY- THAT SAID- KNEW NO THAT WE COULDN'T COME TO CONCLUSION ON THE AMENDMENTS- CAN'T SUPPORT I CANNOT SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY BUT I'M GRATEFUL. TO SENATOR BATES FOR HER WORK. IN FOR HER ENGAGEMENT AND KNOW THAT WE'RE GONNA BE WORKING TOGETHER ON OTHER ISSUES HERE IN THE WEEKS AND MONTHS TO COME. SENATE RATES WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE ABLE TO CLOSE WE DO HAVE A MOTION ON THE FLOOR BY SENATOR NELSON- THANK YOU- TURMAN REQUIRING. THANK YOU FOR THOSE COMMENTS. I AM CERTAINLY OFFER THE CONVERSATION TODAY ON BOTH THE SUPPORTERS SAY ON TO THOSE OPPOSED. I THINK WE DO HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO TIGHTEN UP ON THE ASSAULT. OPPORTUNITY FOR ABUSE- THE- THE DISCUSSION GOES ON I THINK WE NEED TO. YOU KNOW GET THEIR HIGH AND NOT TRY TO BALANCE AGAIN BECAUSE I THINK WE HEARD LOUD AND CLEAR WITH PROP FIFTEEN. PEOPLE ARE NOT READY FOR THAT HAS A LOT TO DO WITH. WHAT TRICKLES DOWN TO PEOPLE WHO ARE. LEASING AND RENTING PROPERTY FROM THOSE WHO OWNED A LARGE. CORPORATE JOB. FACILITIES OF CENTER AND ALL THAT THAT'S- A HUGE ISSUE OUT THERE YOU KNOW ALL RIGHT- COMMUNITIES WHERE PEOPLE. ARE YOU KNOW I HAD BOGGED IN COMMERCE AND HAVE SOUGHT TO. DO DURING THE PANDEMIC BASICALLY STAY ALIVE AND WHEN IT LOOKED LIKE- THIS WAS GOING TO GO THROUGH AND THAT THEIR THEIR TAXES SO WE'RE GONNA GO UP THERE FOR THEIR CUSTOMERS. YOU KNOW RAN CHAN LEAF WAS GOING TO GO UP THE EXPONENTIALLY I THINK THAT THAT MADE THE DIFFERENCE SO THERE'S A SOLUTION THERE I ALWAYS LOOK AT THESE THINGS THAT WAY. MAYBE WE HAVEN'T FOUND IT YET BUT WE'RE GETTING CLOSE I FELT THAT THIS BILL SIMPLY. REMOVE THE TEMPTATION FOR TO ABUSE AND IN THE INTERIM BEFORE WE FIND THE PERFECT SOLUTION TO CERTAINLY WOULD BE A WAY THAT YIELD GOING FORWARD AND NOT IN THE NEAR TERM ON THE TO. GET ADDITIONAL TAX REVENUE. FROM THOSE WHO DO SEEK. NINE TO FIVE FIND A LOOPHOLE ANNEX AND- ESCAPE. ARE THERE LEGITIMATE- RESOURCES THAT SHOULD GO TO OUR STATE SO WITH THAT THANK YOU AND I WILL RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN I. BOAT. AND WE WILL REVISIT THE ISSUE.

AND ALLIN ABS FROM THE BEER QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT THANK YOU OBVIOUSLY I STRUGGLE YOU WANT TO GIVE US A QUICK THIRTY SECOND SUMMARY OF THE BILL PLEASE SERVICE DEPARTMENT- THIS IS REALLY A PROACTIVE STEP TOWARDS ENCOURAGING LOW INCOME CONSUMERS. JUST WHAT THE OLDER POLLUTING VEHICLES FOR A CLEANER ONE AND REALLY EASES THE FINANCIAL. BARRIERS AS YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT GONNA HIT OUR CLIMATE GOALS WERE NOT REALLY GONNA CHEAP WHAT WE NEED TO- IN LESS WE START GETTING. WIDESPREAD ADOPTION B. B. T. V.'S PARTICULARLY IN LOWER INCOME IN DISADVANTAGED NEIGHBORHOODS. AND THIS EFFORT ENCOURAGING USED DVDS AND HIGH MAS HYBRIDS. IS A STEP IN THAT DIRECTION. IT IS GOING TO TAKE A MOMENT BEFORE WE GO TO OUR WITNESSES AT CENTRE BECKER IN HIS TEAM THEY HAD BEEN DEEPLY INVOLVED IN THIS BILL. REALLY WE TRY TO MAKE THIS BILL AS PRACTICAL AS POSSIBLE WHAT I ALSO REALLY APPRECIATE ABOUT CENTER BACKERS FOCUSES ON THIS BILL. IS CREATING DEMAND FOR USED CAR MARKET FOR THESE EV'S BUT WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING LIKE THAT AT THE MOMENT- IT IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL TO BRING EQUITY TO COMMUNITIES AND JUST WANNA. TAKE A MOMENT TO BE ABLE TO ACKNOWLEDGE SENATOR BAKER FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THIS- AS WE MEET THESE. ZERO EMISSION GOALS- AND HAVE TO PHASE OUT THAT COMBUSTIBLE ENGINE THIS IS GOING TO BE A BIG PART OF IT AS WE MOVE FORWARD.

CLEAN AIR NOW YOU ARE NOW IN COMMITTEE. THE FLOOR IS YOURS PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU YOUR MEMBERS ALL BE. MY IS TOM KNOX I'M SELL IT. AIR NOW. AND ON BEHALF OF THE DOLLAR DISTRICT THE ADMIN. BECAUSE PROGRAMS IN SEVENTY DOLLARS. THE REASON THAT GREEN CARDS ALSO IMPORTANT IS A LOW INCOME FAMILY STATUS DISPROPORTIONATE AMOUNT OF THEIR INCOME ON TRANSPORTATION COSTS. A LACK OF ACCESS TO TRANSPORTATION MAINLY DUE TO YOUR EMPLOYMENT AND EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES. A STUDY BY THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA DOWN THE ONE WAY TO WORK OR TO DRIVE A-CAR OR HAVE ACCESS TO MORE THAN TWO TIMES JOB OPPORTUNITIES WITH WORKERS WHO DEPEND ON PUBLIC TRANSIT. ACCESS TO RELIABLE TRANSPORTATION IS CRUCIAL TO MAINTAINING STABLE EMPLOYMENT. REACHING EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES CARING FOR FAMILY AND STAYING HEALTHY. BY PROVIDING A SALES TAX EXEMPTION FOR VEHICLES PURCHASED THROUGH CLEAN CARS FOR ALL SB SEVEN SEVEN ONE OR THE- ECONOMIC MOBILITY BY LOWERING TRANSPORTATION COSTS FOR WORKING FAMILIES. WHILE% HELPING THE STATE REQUIREMENT AN AIR QUALITY GOALS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. HEY MR KNOX THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS- AND VERY GRATEFUL FOR THAT STATEMENT. THANK YOU FOR HANGING WITH US. NOT SO LATE HERE INTO THE AFTERNOON. LAZING GENTLEMAN I WORK IN NOW GOING TO ALLE ABS FROM THE BAY AREA AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT. MR ABBAS YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES WE'RE GONNA ASK FOR A TRUNCATED VERSION IS YOUR OF YOUR STATEMENT. AS WE DO HAVE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IN COMMITTEE MR ABBAS. WELCOME SIR GOOD TO HEAR YOUR VOICE. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR CHOIR MEMBERS OF COMMITTEE I ALAN WITH BAY AREA QUALITY. DISTRICT I'M TESTIFYING TO EXPLAIN THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CLEAN CARS FOR ALL PROGRAM IN THE BAY AREA TO SUPPORT EQUITY IN ADVANCING A CLEAN CAR FUTURE. CLEAN CARDS FOR ALL OF THE RETIRE AND REPLACE PROGRAM INCOME QUALIFIED RESIDENTS IN COMMUNITIES DISPROPORTIONATELY BURDENED BY POLLUTION CAN TURN IN AN OLDER VEHICLE. AND GET AN INCENTIVE TO PURCHASE OR LEASE A NEW OR USED TO PLUG IN HYBRID ELECTRIC VEHICLE OR FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLE. IN THE TWO YEARS THAT THE BEARING HMD HAS ADMINISTERED THIS PROGRAM WE HAVE SUPPORTED APPROXIMATELY EIGHTEEN HUNDRED VEHICLE PURCHASES. WITH TWO THIRDS OF THOSE OCCURRING IN OUR MOST DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. CURRENTLY DESPITE THE PANDEMIC WE AVERAGE ABOUT ONE HUNDRED FOR. A VEHICLE PURCHASES A MONTH. THE HOUSEHOLD INCOME IN THE VEHICLE CHOSEN DETERMINES THE GRANT AMOUNT YOU CAN RECEIVE FROM THIS PROGRAM WITH GRANTS RANGING FROM FIFTY FIVE HUNDRED TO NINETY FIVE HUNDRED DEPENDING ON INCOME. AND THE VEHICLE TYPE. BUT THE AVERAGE CLEAN CARS FOR ALL VEHICLE CURRENTLY COSTS TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS WELL THE AVERAGE CLEAN CARS FOR ALL INCENTIVE IS EIGHTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS. WITH THE AVERAGE LOAN FINANCING BEING FOURTEEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED. BUT THAT STILL REQUIRES A SIGNIFICANT OUT OF POCKET EXPENSE FOR MOST ELIGIBLE APPLICANTS. PROVIDING AN ADDITIONAL INCENTIVE OR LIMITING THE TAX BURDEN ON INDIVIDUALS PARTICIPATING IN THIS PROGRAM WILL HELP EXPAND THE APPLICANT POOL AND SUPPORT CALIFORNIA'S EQUITY IN ZERO EMISSION BOWL. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY AND I LOOK FORWARD TO ANSWERING ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE.
