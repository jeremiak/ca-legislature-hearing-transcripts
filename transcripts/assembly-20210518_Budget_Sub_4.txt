GOVERNOR NEW SUMS CALIFORNIA COME BACK PLAN ON HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS. THE CALIFORNIA COME BACK PLAN BUILT ON THE PRINCIPLE THAT AN EQUITABLE ECONOMIC RECOVERY MUST INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS AND HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS. THE BUDGET PLAN PREVENT EVICTIONS AND DISPLACEMENT BY PROVIDING DIRECT RELIEF TO RENTERS. LANDLORDS HOMEOWNERS THROUGH EXPANDED RENTAL ASSISTANCE FOR CLOSURE PREVENTION. AND HOMEBUYER DOWN PAYMENTS OF. IMPORTANTLY A CENTERFOLD OF THE COME BACK IS ON CALL. THE PLAN PRESENTS A BOLD PROPOSAL TO HOME KEY WHICH IS BEING A DOT BY STATES AND ALSO BY OUR FEDERAL PARTNER AS AN- MODEL. IT ALSO ADVANCES A COMP. IN LAW PRONG OF. THAT'S TO A FOUND HOME OVER TO FIVE. WITH THE C. S. H. AND THE HEALTH AND HUMAN. HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY WORKING CLOSELY. COLLECTIVELY THESE APPROACHES ADVANCED THE STATE'S COMMITMENT TO EXPAND HOUSING ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY. THROUGH INCREASES IN HOUSING VOLUME. I COUNT ABILITY AND FACILITATING EXPEDIENCY ALL WITH A FOCUS ON EQUITY. THE MAY REVISION LAYS THE FOUNDATION FOR AN EQUITABLE RECOVERY AND BUILT UPON THE INVESTMENTS PROPOSED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING PACKAGE OF NINE POINT THREE BILLION IN THE HOMELESSNESS PACKAGE OF TWELVE POINT FOUR BILLION. THIS PROPOSAL INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING ITEMS ADMINISTERED THROUGH PCS H. AND IT'S THE APARTMENTS. FIRST BEGINNING WITH HOUSING. TO HELP STABILIZE CALIFORNIA TENANTS THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES TO EXPAND THE CURRENT RENT WOULD BE PROGRAM TO COVER UP TO A 100% OF BACK RENT AND FUTURE RENT TO USING AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN FUNDING TO KEEP FAMILY'S HOUSE. IN ADDITION TO THE COMBINED FIVE POINT TWO BILLION AND RENTAL ASSISTANCE THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES TWO BILLION IN UTILITY ASSISTANCE. AND TWENTY MILLION FOR LEGAL AID SERVICES FOR TENANTS IN MORTGAGE LENDER HOLDERS. TO PREVENT HOMEOWNERS FROM GOING INTO FORECLOSURE THE U. S. TREASURY HAS ALLOCATED ONE BILLION IN OUR FANS WHO ARE HOMEOWNER ASSISTANCE WHICH WILL BE ADMINISTERED BY THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY. THIS WILL PROVIDE MORTGAGE RELIEF AND PRINCIPLE REDUCTIONS TO HOMEOWNERS WITH MORTGAGE DELINQUENCIES. A COMBINATION OF RENTAL ASSISTANCE AND HOMEOWNER RELIEF PRESENTS A HOLISTIC SET OF SOLUTIONS FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. IN TWENTY TWENTY THIRTEEN THOUSAND FAMILIES ACHIEVE HOMEOWNERSHIP THROUGH CALIFORNIA FACED DOWN PAYMENT DOWN PAYMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS 61% OF THE HOUSEHOLDS THAT WERE SERVED WERE BLACK OR LATINO CONTRIBUTING TO THE NARROWING OF THE STATE'S WEALTH GAP IN REDRESSING PAST RACIAL INJUSTICES. THE MAJOR REVISION PROPOSES TO ADD A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO EXPAND THE STATE'S FIRST TIME HOME BUYER PROGRAM AND TO HELP BETWEEN FIVE TO EIGHT THOUSAND MORE LOW TO MODERATE INCOME FAMILIES. THIS WILL BE PAIRED WITH AN ONGOING STRATEGY TO INCREASE A ROBUST PRESENCE IN DISADVANTAGED AREAS INCLUDING EXPANDING RENDON NETWORKS AND LEVERAGING THE BUILDING BLACK WEALTH IN HOUSING COUNSELING INITIATIVES. I'D LIKE TO JUST COSTA THANK THE LEGISLATURE FOR HAVING SIGNIFICANT LEGISLATION IN RECENT YEARS TO ADVANCE HOUSING- AND ALSO TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR CALIFORNIANS TO BUILD ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS OR EIGHTY YEARS. IN RECOGNITION OF THE NEED TO EXPAND TO LUCIA'S FOR ANYTHING YOU FINANCING HOW MUCH OF A HAS BEEN IN THE PROCESS OF STANDING UP A PROGRAM USING NINETEEN MILLION IN EXISTING FUNDS TO CATALYZETHE PRODUCTION OF INGREDIENTS. THE MAY REVISION PROPOSES TO EXPAND THIS PROGRAM BY ADDING EIGHTY ONE MILLION TO HELP LOW AND MODERATE INCOME. HOMEOWNERS FINANCE EIGHTY YOU. INCREASING THE SUPPLY OF HOUSING WHILE ALSO FURTHERING OUR GOAL OF HOUSING EQUITY. IN THINKING. IN THINKINGABOUT THE HOUSING SPECTRUM THIS PROPOSAL DOES NOT OVERLOOK A SEGMENT OF OUR MOST ESSENTIAL WORKERS. MIGRANT FARM WORKERS THE GOVERNOR IS PROPOSING A TOTAL THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR ATVS MY CURRENT FARMWORKER HOUSING TO ADDRESS DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND MAKE HEALTH AND SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS AND TO ENHANCE THE LIVABILITY OF THESE COMMUNITIES. WITH A FOCUS ON PRESERVATION THREE HUNDRED MILLION AND OUR PIPELINES ARE ALSO BEING PROPOSED TO SUSTAIN THE AFFORDABILITY REQUIREMENTS OF HEVS LEGACY PROJECTS AS AFFORDABILITY COVENANTS EXPIRE. AND AS THESE PROJECTS BECOME AT RISK FOR TRANSITIONING INTO THE MARKET RATE HOUSING INVENTORY. IN CALIFORNIA OVER THE LAST YEAR DEMAND FOR FINANCING TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING HAS OUTPACED FUNDS THAT ARE AVAILABLE IN MANY PROJECTS HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO SECURE THE FINAL FINANCING NECESSARY TO START CONSTRUCTION. BY INVESTING IN AT ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION AND ARE FOR FUNDS WE WILL BE ABLE TO EXPEDITE THE CONSTRUCTION OF MORE THAN SIXTY THREE HUNDRED UNITS. OF SHOVEL READY PROJECTS ARE THAT ARE ALL AFFORDABLE. MY MOVING QUICKLY PROJECT WILL ALSO AVOID DEVELOPMENT DELAYS AND ACCUMULATING COSTS. WE CONTINUE TO WORK IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES AND OTHER LOCAL PARTNERS TO LEVERAGE STATE EXCESS LANDS AND TO REPOSITION THE SITES FOR HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. WITH AN ADDITIONAL FORTY FIVE MILLION AND ARE FOR FINANCE H. ET WILL SCALE UP STATE EXCESS LAND DEVELOPMENT WITH FUNDING FOR VITAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND TO MAKE HOUSING PROJECTS VIABLE. ADDITIONALLY THE CALIFORNIA COME BACK PLAN ALSO PRIORITIZE PRIORITIZE THIS PART STATE GOAL OF REDUCING GREENHOUSE GASES. WE KNOW THAT PLANNING WITH COMMUNITIES AROUND SUSTAINABLE LIVING IT'S IMPORTANT TO MEETING THIS GOAL. TO ASSIST LOCAL COMMUNITIES ADVANCED COMPREHENSIVE PLANS THAT BRING CLIMATE TRANSIT AND HOUSING INVESTMENTS TOGETHER. FIVE HUNDRED MILLION IN FINES HAVE BEEN PROPOSED FOR PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION GRANTS TO PROVIDE REGIONAL ENTITIES THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADVANCE INFO INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS AND PLANNING INITIATIVES. THESE COMBINED HOUSING INVESTMENTS COUPLED WITH THE STRATEGIES AND PROGRAMS TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS WILL LEAD TO UNLOCKING AT LEAST. FORTY SIX THOUSAND NEW HOUSING UNITS AND HOUSING PLACEMENTS. NOT LET ME SPEAK WITH YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT- HOMELESSNESS. ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS COMPREHENSIVELY IS THE CENTRAL FOCUS OF THE GOVERNOR'S CALIFORNIA COME BACK PLAN WITH A COMBINED TWELVE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS FOR A UNIFIED MULTI AGENCY APPROACH TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS. THE PLAN PROPOSES HOUSING SOLUTIONS FOR THE FULL DIVERSITY OF PEOPLE THAT ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND WITH A FOCUS ON RACIAL EQUITY. THE MAY REVISION INCLUDES ABOUT SEVEN BILLION FOR ACQUISITION AND WE HAVE OF HOUSING INCLUDING CONVERSION OF HOTELS IN VACANT BUILDINGS THE INTERIM AND PERMANENT HOUSING FOR INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. THE PLAN LEVERAGES THE SUCCESS OF LAST YEAR'S HOME HE- IN JUST SIX MONTHS LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WERE ABLE TO ACQUIRE NINETY FOUR PROJECTS INCLUDING EIGHT SIX THOUSAND UNITS TO HOUSE INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AT A COST OF EIGHT HUNDRED AND FORTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS. THIS YEAR THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING THREE POINT FIVE BILLION HOLE T. TWO POINT NOW WITH ONE BILLION TARGETING FAMILIES EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS OR AT RISK OF BECOMING HOMELESS. I AM PARTICULARLY EXCITED THAT THE GOVERNOR IS PROPOSING A FOCUS ON FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN THIS IS A BOLD INITIATIVE THAT SEEKS TO END FAMILY HOMELESSNESS BY TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN AND I KNOW WE CAN DO IT. ASSEMBLY HOMELESSNESS IS THE FASTEST GROWING SEGMENT OF CALIFORNIANS. WHO ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS OVER THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND FAMILIES EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS WERE SERVED BY THE STATE'S HOMELESSNESS RESPONSE SYSTEM THE TWENTY TWENTY. A DATA POINT THAT WE ARE NOW ABLE TO HAVE THANKS TO THE HOMELESS DATA INTEGRATION SYSTEM THAT WAS RECENTLY LAUNCHED BY THE HOMELESS COORDINATING AND FINANCING COUNCIL. THIS FOCUS ON ENDING FAMILY HOMELESSNESS WILL REQUIRE UP ORDINATED APPROACH ACROSS THE STATE GOVERNMENT AND IN PARTNERSHIP WITH FEDERAL AGENCIES LOCAL LEADERS AND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. IN ADDITION TO THE SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN FUNDING FOR THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING SUPPORT IN BRINGING FAMILIES HOME PROGRAMS WHICH ARE ADMINISTERED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. THE MAY REVISION INCLUDES FORTY MILLION FOR ENDING FAMILY HOMELESSNESS CHALLENGE GRANTS AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SUPPORT HCFC. FIFTY POINT THREE MILLION FOR EACH YEAR SEEK TO PARTNER WITH CALTRANS AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO MITIGATE SAFETY RISKS ADDING COMPLIMENTS ON. OPERATING AND TO ADMINISTER TARGETED GRANTS TO LOCAL. THIS INVESTMENT HONORS A FACT THAT WILL PERMIT HOUSING IS THE ONLY TRUE SOLUTION TO ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS THERE ALSO ARE THOUSANDS OF UNSHELTERED CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE FACING URGENT AND DANGEROUS CRISIS SEES EVERY SINGLE DAY WE NEED OUR SUPPORT. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ALSO CALLS ATTENTION TO ACCOUNTABILITY. HCFC LAUNCH H. H. THE I. S. THE STATE'S FIRST STATEWIDE HOMELESSNESS. LET'S NOT STATE AN ANALYSIS BY COMBINING INFORMATION FROM THE FORTY FOUR CONTINUE ARMS OF CARE ACROSS THE STATE INTO ONE SINGLE POINT OF ACCESS. THE GOVERNOR IS PROPOSING FIVE POINT SIX MILLION FOR HDFC TO BUILT ON THE LEARNINGS FROM H. YEAH YES AND TO CONDUCT IN FRANCE GIVE ASSESSMENT OF LOCAL HOMELESS NET SERVICE PROVIDERS AND STATE FUNDED HOMELESSNESS PROGRAMS. THE ASSESSMENT WILL PROVIDE A DETAILED. VIEW OF THE RANGE OF SERVICES AND THE STRATEGIES THAT ARE UTILIZED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND HELP DETERMINE THE STATE INVESTMENT ARE LINED WITH LOCAL HOMELESSNESS RESPONSIVE AND- IT WILL ALSO ENSURE THAT COLLECTIVELY THERE'S GREATER ACCOUNTABILITY AROUNDTHE PLANNING AND THE EXPENDITURE OF HOMELESSNESS RESOURCES. FINALLY AT THE STATE CONTINUES TO RECOVER AND BOLSTER LONG TERM EQUITY AND RESILIENCY. CALIFORNIA COME BACK PLAN CONTINUES TO BUILD UPON ITS SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH YOU ALL IN PARTNERSHIP WITH LOCALS AND WITH SUPPORT FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. IN C. A. S. H. AND THAT'S DEPARTMENTS HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH OUR SYSTEM PARTNERS TO ACHIEVE GREATER COORDINATION AND ALIGNMENT IN BOTH HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS. WE HAVE THE CAPACITY AND THE DRIVE TO IMPLEMENT THESE INVESTMENTS. IN CLOSING I'M HAPPY TO SHARE THESE COMPONENTS OF THE CALIFORNIA COME BACK PLAN WITH ALL OF YOU AB I TRULY BELIEVE THAT THIS WILL LEAD TO AN EQUITABLE RECOVERY THAT POSITION AT THE STATE. AND THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE WORK WITH TO ROAR BACK WITH STRENGTH AND RESILIENCY. THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND YOUR TIME. I LOOK FORWARD TO OUR CONTINUED PARTNERSHIP. AND NOW I'M JOINED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND MEMBERS OF MY TEAM TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM SECRETARY BEFORE WE CONTINUE LET'S ESTABLISH QUORUM MR SECRETARY CAN YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. CORREO HERE TO HEAR COOPER- LACKEY HERE LET'S AREA. I DON'T KNOW I. ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MISTER CHIP. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- LET ME FIRST JUST SAY TO MADAM SECRETARY JUST APPRECIATE. YOUR COMMITMENT IN OUR GOVERNOR'S COMMITMENT TO ADDRESSING THE MORAL CRISIS OF THE DAY BEFORE THE PANDEMIC AND DURING AND AFTER WHICH IS HOMELESSNESS- I THINK WE ALL RECOGNIZE THAT. THIS HAS BEEN A SITUATION THAT'S BEEN COMPLETELY UNTENABLE AND AS THE GOVERNOR SAID THIS BUDGET SURPLUS IS A ONCE IN A LIFETIME OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO INVEST AND MAKE MAJOR PROGRESS TO END HOMELESSNESS AND A VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT ALSO WANT TO COMMEND THE ADMINISTRATIONFOR. YOUR SUCCESSES AROUND HOME KEY WHICH REALLY HAS BEEN- AN INCREDIBLE MODEL- AND THE FOCUS IN THIS BUDGET AROUND FAMILY HOMELESSNESS I THINK WE HAVE A REAL CHANCE OF BEING ABLE TO NOT JUST REDUCE THOSE NUMBERS BUT HOPEFULLY. AFFECTIVELY ENDED HI IN THE COMING YEARS- I WANNA REYES MISTER CHEWING UP SO SORRY MY APOLOGIES TO INTERRUPT YOU BEFORE WE GO TO YOUR QUESTION CAN WE HEAR FROM THE ALLEY- FIRST ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU AT THE OFFICE OF THE ONLY A PLACE. MISS MORALIS. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M THAT'S WHAT I THAT'S WHAT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE I'LL BE WRITING A FEW OVER ARCHING COMMENTS ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S NAME REVISION HOUSING HOMELESSNESS PROPOSALS BEFORE MAKING SOME SPECIFIC COMMENTS THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISION CONTINUES TO RECOGNIZE THE STATE'S HOUSING AFFORDABILITY AND HOMELESSNESS CHALLENGES ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES HAVE BEEN A PRIORITY OF THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR AND ARE WORTHWHILE GOALS. IN THE MAY REVISION THE GOVERNOR SETS A GOAL TO FUNCTIONALLY AND FAMILY HOMELESSNESS AND FIGHTERS TO DO SO HE INTRODUCES OVER THIRTY FIVE PROPOSALS THAT FINDING YOU AN EXISTING PROGRAM ACROSS THIRTEEN STATE ENTITIES AT THIS TIME IT'S UNCLEAR TO US HOW THE VARIOUS COMPONENTS OF THE GOVERNOR'S ME REVISION PACKAGE WORK TOGETHER TO MEET THE SCHOOL. ADMINISTRATION DOES NOT IDENTIFIED IN TROUBLES TO MEASURE THE STATE'S PROGRESS REPORTS FUNCTIONALLY ENDING FAMILY HOMELESSNESS IN FIVE YEARS IN ADDITION BALLOT HOMELESSNESS IS ONE DIMENSION OF THE STATE HOMELESSNESS CRISIS THE LEGISLATURE WILL HAVE TO ASSESS IT THERE IT HAS OTHER GOALS IN OTHER DIMENSIONS OF HOMELESSNESS AND WHETHER OR THE STATE. BUDGET CAN ADDRESS THOSE GOALS AS WELL. THE GOVERNOR'S AND MAJOR HOME AND- FOR STARTING NEXT. EXISTING STATE PROGRAM TO BUILD. HOUSING AND- OF THE STATE THE AT. THAT OFFER HAPPINESS. RECENT BUDGETS HAVE PROVIDED FLEXIBLE FUNDING DIRECTLY TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SO THEY CAN ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS AND NOT FROM COMMUNITIES. THE MAIN REVISION DOES NOT INCLUDE THIS TYPE OF PROPOSAL. THE LEGISLATURE WE WANT TO AFFECTED IT'S COMFORTABLE WITH THIS CHANGE FOR WHAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO NINETEEN FLEXIBLE HUNTING FOR LOCALS AS A FEATURE OF THE. STATE ALMOST MISTER SPOCK'S. TO WRAP UP MY GENERAL COME. IN THE PAST TRUMP RECOMMENDED THE LEGISLATURE ESTABLISH A PLAN FOR ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS THE GOVERNOR'S MEMBERS ARE LAID OUT ONE POSSIBLE APPROACH. NOW THE LEGISLATURE SIGNED IF IT WANTS TO ADOPT THE GOVERNOR STRATEGY OR MAKE SOME MODIFICATIONS. TURNING TO SPECIFIC PROPOSALS IN THE IN THE GOVERNOR'S NAME REVISION. MANY OF THE GOVERNOR'S UNIVISION PROPOSALS REQUIRE LEGISLATION TO IMPLEMENT. WHICH IS NOT YET AVAILABLE SOME OF THE KEY QUESTIONS THAT REMAIN THAT COULD BE ADDRESSED THREE TBL ARE WHICH PROJECTS IN EACH CITY'S BACKGROUND WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR FUNDING FOR THE GOVERNOR'S ONE POINT SEVEN FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. PORTABLE HOUSING PRODUCTION BACKGROUND MUSCLE. AND HOWARD LESSONS LEARNED OVER THE LAST YEAR ABOUT HOME HE INFORMED HOW THE PROPOSED TWO POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDING WOULD BE USED. AS AN EXAMPLE HOW COULD YOU FACILITATE THE USE OF A DIFFERENT MIX OF PROPERTIES AS HOTELS AND MOTELS MAY NOT BE AS READILY AVAILABLE FOR USE TO COMPETE. AT THE EFFECTS OF THE PANDEMIC SUBSIDE. IN OTHER CASES. SUCH AS THE REGION EARLY ACTS. PLANNING PRO PROPOSAL. UNIONIST THAT MISSION INTO. IT INTENT OF. ALIKI METHOD. THAT MINISTRY. FOLLOWING THE ADOPTION OF THE PROJECT RATHER THAN TO KEEP OUT THIS APPROACH WOULD LIMIT THE LEGISLATURE'S AUTHORITY. IN ADDITION ALLEGE HAS MADE MAJOR INVESTMENTS TO EXPAND THE STATE AFFORDABLE HOUSING STOCK IN RECENT YEARS THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED NEW PROVISION ON PROPOSES ADDITIONAL AUGMENTATIONS IN THE SPACE AS PART OF THE REVISION. THE LEGISLATURE WILL HAVE TO DETERMINE HOW IT WILL PRESERVE THESE GAMES IN THE LONG TERM. IN PARTICULAR IN THE CASE OF HOME HE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE PLANS FOR OPERATING SITES FOR FIVE YEARS HOW HOME HE CITES WILL BE OPERATED AND MAINTAINED BEYOND FIVE YEARS IS UNCLEAR. THIS UNCERTAINTY COULD MAKE SOME LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HEADED INTO PARTICIPATING HOME KEY AND COULD CREATE THIS WILL PRESSURES FOR THE STATE AND THE LONG TERM TO PROTECT HUNKY INVESTMENTS. THE STATEMENT WANT TO CONSIDER HOW IT BALANCES CAPITAL INVESTMENTS AND OPERATING. COSTS WITHIN THE HOME KEEP PROGRAM. THE STATE TO EXPAND DRIVE ADDICTS AND PROPOSED. PROPOSED WITHIN THE TWO. ON ESTABLISHED AMERICA. IS ALSO CLEAR IN MANY CASES THE- FUNDING IS MANY. OF BHAGWAT QUESTIONED PROVIDED FOR THESE PROGRAMS IN THE PAST IN PARTICULAR THE THREE POINT FIVE BILLION IN FUNDING ACROSS TWO YEARS FOR HUNKIEST SIGNIFICANT. THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN FUNDING IS AVAILABLE THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY FOUR THE LEGISLATURE IMAGES TO ALLOCATE A PORTION OF PROPOSED FUNDING. THAT MORE CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH THE EXPECTED CAPACITY IN ALLOCATE ADDITIONAL FUNDS LATER. THIS TO PROVIDE THE LEGISLATURE ADDITIONAL TIMETO MAKE HE POLICY DECISIONS ABOUT ITS APPROACH TOWARDS ADDRESSING. THE STATE'S HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS CHALLENGES. FINALLY THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS RELATED TO THE HOMELESSNESS. ACROSS MANY DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS IT WILL BE MORE CRUCIAL THAN EVER FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO SET CLEAR EXPECTATIONS TO STATUTE AND BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE. ESTABLISHING REPORT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS WILL ALSO HELP THE LEGISLATURE EXERCISE OVERSIGHT OVER THE STATE'S PROGRESS TOWARD ADDRESSING. A HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS CHALLENGES IN THE STATE THESE ARE JUST SOME OF OUR INITIAL COMMENTS ON THESE PROPOSALS AND WILL CONTINUE TO ANALYZE THEM. RIGHT YOU WHEN YOU'RE STUCK ONE PERMISSION IT'S TRAILER. BILL BECOMES AVAILABLE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS ONE ISLAND TO GET UP. MISS TWO THREE CONTINUE YOUR QUESTION. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- AS I WAS MENTIONING VERY MUCH APPRECIATE- THE GOVERNOR FOR ON PROJECT HOME KEY IN THE SIX RELAY TO THAT AS WELL AS WHAT I DO UNDERSTAND IN THE MAY REVISED PROPOSALS. THE FOCUS ON FAMILY HOMELESSNESS GIVEN OUR CHANCE TO LITERALLY AND THAT IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS I WANTED TO RAISE THREE SORT OF BIG PICTURE- POINTS OF FEEDBACK THAT WE HAVE RECEIVED FROM AROUND THE STATE ABOUT WHAT MORE WE NEED TO BE DOING. AND JUST I ASK MADAM SECRETARY FOR SOME COMMENTS OF THE FIRST IS- THE CURRENT BUDGET PROPOSAL FOCUSES ON FAMILY HOMELESSNESS BUT WE ALL KNOW. THAT WHAT HAS BEEN FRUSTRATING- OUR CITIES AND HOMELESS ADVOCATES AND SO MANY OF US IS THE LACK OF PROGRESS RELATED TO STREET HOMELESSNESS. WHO ARE TYPICALLY NOT FAMILIES BUT SINGLE INDIVIDUALS- SOMETIMES WITH MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES SUBSTANCE ABUSE CHALLENGES IN OTHERS. AND FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF A LOT OF- WHO WHO REVIEWED THIS BUDGET IT DOESN'T APPEAR THAT THIS BUDGET IS FOCUSING ON WHAT WE SEE EVERY DAY. IN OUR COMMUNITY SO LOVE IT LOVE SOME THOUGHTS ON STREET HOMELESSNESS. SECONDLY I AS I'M SURE YOU'VE BEEN HEARING FROM CITIES AND COUNTIES IN THE LAST COUPLE YEARS. THE BUDGET HAS INVESTED IN CITIES AND CONTINUUM'S OF CARE AND COUNTIES TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS. TO SHELTERS INTERM HOUSING AND RAPID RE HOUSING THIS BUDGET DOESN'T REALLY INCLUDE MONIES FOR THOSE ACTIVITIES AND- WE'RE CERTAINLY HEARING FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ABOUT THE CHALLENGE. IN MAINTAINING EXISTING SHELTER AN EMR HOUSING SOLUTIONS UNDER HE CAN HOP. I'M SURE YOU'RE WELL AWARE OF THE THAT REQUEST FROM THE BIG CITY MAYORS- IN THE SPACE AND TO THE DESIRE FOR MORE FLEXIBLE FUNDING IN THIS AREA WANTED TO UNDERSTAND WHETHER THAT WAS A DELIBERATE DECISION AND WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ARE ON ON THAT. AND THEN THE THIRD BIG PICTURE QUESTION I HAVE IS WE'VE HEARD FROM THE L. A- ABOUT JUST THE FRAGMENTATION IN OUR SYSTEM AND ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS AND I THINK. MANY OF US WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A STEP BACK BACK. IN MOVE FORWARD WITH A MORE COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH THAT FIRST STARTS WITH. A GAPS IN NEEDS ANALYSIS UNDERSTANDING IN EVERY JURISDICTION AT EVERY LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT WHAT'S HAPPENING WHAT'S NOT HAPPENING. MOVING FOR WITH REAL SHORT AND LONG TERM PLANNING. ON HAVING A LONG TERM STRATEGY TO ACTUALLY AND HOMELESSNESS AND- THINKING THROUGH ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES AS WE ARE ABOUT TO PUSH OUT POTENTIALLY. AT LEAST TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS OR THANK YOU FOR UP TO MANY OF US IN THE LEGISLATURE OR A HIGHER AMOUNT. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE INVESTINGIN OUR COMMUNITIES AND THAT MONEY IS BEING PUT TO GOOD USE AND SO LOVE SOME THOUGHTS ABOUT. THIS DISCUSSION AROUND A MORE COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH OF ANALYSIS PLANNING AND ACCOUNTABILITY. SO I KNOW THIS IS A LOT OF QUESTIONS IN ONE BUT- SECRETARY FEW THOUGHTS ON ANY OF THOSE TOPICS WOULD APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU SO MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND AT ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES CMPREHENSIVELY- I DON'T WILL START OFF WITH A RESPONSE AND THEN I WILL ASK OUR DEPUTY SECRETARY FOR HOMELESSNESS TO AND ADD ADDITIONAL DETAIL. ON THE FIRST OF ALL LET ME JUST TRY TO CLARIFY THAT D. R. TWELVE POINT FOUR BILLION THAT IS PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR- TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS. IS PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON- HOMELESSNESS INDIVIDUALS AND SUPPORTING LOCAL EFFORTS TO ADDRESS AND INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE ACCESSING THE HOMELESSNESS RESPONSE SYSTEM- AND I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY THAT ONE COMPONENT- OF THE OVERALL- PLAN IS. TO DEVELOP THAT WERE NEEDED A COMPREHENSIVE AND MULTI PRONGED STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS FAMILY HOMELESSNESS SO FOR EXAMPLE OUT OF THAT THREE POINT FIVE BILLION- THAT IS BEING PROPOSED FOR HOME P. ONE BILLION WOULD BE SET ASIDE FOR FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN- OF THE ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION THAT. IS BEING PROPOSED TO ACCELERATE AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTY OR OR SO IS BEING PROPOSED- FOR- FOR FAMILY AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS SO I SHARE THAT AS AN EXAMPLE BECAUSE I DON'T WANT- I WANTED TO CLARIFY- ASSEMBLY MEMBER THAT. WE ARE COMPLETELY I'M STILL VERY MUCH FOCUSED ON ADDRESSING- HOMELESSNESS AMONG INDIVIDUALS ADDRESSING- INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS THAT ARE LIVING IN KATHMANDU- BUT ALSO YOU KNOW RECOGNIZE THAT- IT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE HAVE. FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN AND I DON'T HAVE A PLACE TO CALL HOME AND YOU KNOW I DO THINK THAT WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO COORDINATE WITH OUR- SISTER AGENCY HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES WITH LOCAL PARTNERS. AND ALSO TO LEVERAGE A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS THAT ARE COMING IN FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OUT TO MAKE A REAL DENT- IT HONEST- SECONDLY I WILL ALSO MENTION THAT IN TERMS OF. STRATEGY AND A PLAN TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS AT THE STATE- I AM PROUD TO SHARE THAT. THE HOMELESS COORDINATING A PLAN FINANCING COUNCIL JUST TO TWO MONTHS AGO MAYBE THREE MONTHS AGO ADOPTED A COMPREHENSIVE. ACTION PLAN TO PREVENT AND END HOMELESSNESS THAT SPEAKS TO THE COMMITMENT OF VARIOUS. STATE DEPARTMENTS AND STATE AGENCY EAST AND LOCAL- TO. SMOKE THE MEAT ON THIS- AND SO WE KNOW VERY MUCH BUT THAT. THIS IN OUR AGE- COUNCIL OR IN OUR AGENCY ACCOUNT ON HOME. WHICH IS THAT HM C- PAST THE PLAY AND NOW HAS THE DATA EIGHT. THE H. E. I. S. SYSTEM TO BE ABLE TO DRIVE- THIS ORDINATED APPROACH- INTO ALSO THE LAND OF THE SUPPORT OUT TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES- AND THEN WITH REGARD TO THE FUNDING- IN THAT WAR- YEAH ADDITIONAL FUNDING AT TO SUPPORT HOMELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS. IT IS THIS YOU KNOW WE CONTINUE TO HAVE- HAP IN FEET TALLER SUSTAINABLE. AND THAT IT TO SOME YOU KNOW- IN SOME JURISDICTIONS OR IN SOME LOCALITIES AT THOSE DOLLARS ARE BEING DEPLOYED AND MADE. AVAILABLE TO ADVANCE A LOCAL SOLUTIONS AND IN SOME OTHER AREAS OUR TEAM IS CONTINUING TO WORK CLOSELY TO ENSURE THAT THOSE FOLDERS ARE INVESTED INPUT TO SOLUTIONS THAT WILL. I HAVE- SIGNIFICANT- AND POSITIVE OUTCOMES- SO WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO MAYBE ASK DEPUTY SECRETARY- ALLEY SEVEN IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO WAIT. AND THEN ADD ANY ADDITIONAL DETAILS. THANK SECRETARY I THINK I WOULD IF I AT A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL TO A OF THE PIECES. AROUND HOMELESS- WITH THAT IS QUITE A BIT ACT AND THEN THE- AND BENNETT WELL IT A LOTOF THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. I'M VERY ARE THE COMING HARMONIUM OF. OH I'M SORRY I CAN ALSO TALK ABOUT LOTTERY. GREAT RIGHT AND SO WE JUST THINK I THINK THAT THAT AND THERE'S QUITE A FEW PEOPLE IN THE PROPOSAL THAT WILL ACTUALLY DIRECTLY SUPPORT FOLKS THAT ARE EXPERIENCING A SHELTERED HOMELESSNESS. I THINK THAT THE POTENTIAL THAT THE WAY WE HAVE IT STRUCTURED IT IT'S NOT AS OBVIOUS IN THAT AND THAT MADE ME ARE YOU HAD AN OPEN BOOK ON FIRST BLUSH BUT- DOUBLE OF THOSE EITHER BUT I WOULD JUST CALL OUT- BECAUSE WITH THAT I AGREE MORE ON THAT THE AGENT OUTSIDE AND THAT THE BEHAVIORAL- HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE PIECES WE REALLY DO YOU THINK WILL HELP FOLKS- THAT THAT THREAT ARE COMING IN FROM ST HOMELESSNESS THAT NEED A LONGER TERM RESPITE BETTER THINGS LIKE THAT. THAT WOULD HAVE CALL OUT THAT IS THE IS THE PIECE THAT WE DO THINK WILL BE A SAFE LANDING SPOT FOR A LOT OF FOLKS EXPERIENCING UNSHELTERED HOMELESSNESS WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE HOUSING ELEMENT THAT THE HOUSING DISABILITY ADVOCACY PROGRAM THAT WERE IN THAT YES THAT'S RIGHT BUT WE'RE ENCOURAGING AN INCREASE IN THE PROPOSAL. REALLY DIRECTLY UP- SUPPORTS A LOT OF FOLKS THAT ARE EXPERIENCING CHRONIC FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE YES- AND THEN THE THIRD PIECE THAT I WOULD JUST CALL OUT THAT IS NEW AND WE'RE ACTUALLY QUITE EXCITED ABOUT THAT AT THE END- REACHED YES THE IS AROUND ARGUMENT EFFORTS. WE KNOW THAT THERE'S A LOT MORE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE NOW WE KNOW THERE'S A LOT MORE TO LEARN THERE AND YOU REALLY WANT TO ENCOURAGE AND SUPPORT- LEARNING THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND SO THOSE BOTH BUT EXPERIENCE THAT WE INTEND THAT THAT ARE PROPOSED IN THAT. IN THAT- GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL REALLY ARE INTENDED TO GO OUT TO COMMUNITIES WITH LARGER ENCAMPMENTS HELP THEM FIGURE OUT HOW TO RESOLVE THAT AND I THINK AND STABLE WAY FOR FOLKS MOVING EVERYONE INTO PERMANENT HOUSING AND THEN TAKING THOSE LEARNINGS AND REALLY I'M SHARING THAT WITH THE ENTIRE STATE I THINK YOU'RE GOING ON. AND SO IS MY NEPHEW THAT IF HE SAID THAT ARE A LITTLE EMBEDDED WITHIN SOME OF THE PROPOSAL BUT THAT WILL BE DIRECTLY SUPPORTIVE UP. UP THERE EXPERIENCING STREET. JUST TO FOLLOW UP. I GUESS WHAT I DID HEAR. TIED SAY I DO SUPPORT CAN. MONEY CITIES AND- ARE FLEX. AND THEN. DECIDE TO OF A MORE CA. APPROACH OF TOLD FROM FOR WITHIN THE MINISTER. THAT YEAR YOU GOING TO REQUIRE. LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS TO DO REGIONAL CAPS NEEDS ANALYSES AND MORE LONGER TERM PLANNING. WITH ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES- I AM HOPING THAT WILL BE IN BUDGET TRAILER THAT'S SOMETHING I WILL BE LOOKING FOR VERY SPECIFICALLY- WE DON'T HAVE TO. IT LET'S HAVE A QUICK ANSWER NOW. HAPPY TO ENGAGE WITH YOU AFTER THIS. HEARING ON THAT BUT- VERY MUCH HOPE THAT THAT WILL BE PART OF THE PICTURE AS WELL- ONE FINAL QUESTION I KNOW WE COULD TALK. FOR A LONG TIME ON THIS BUT I JUST HAVE ONE FINAL QUESTION WHICH IS- THERE WAS A MENTION OF RENTAL ASSISTANCE AND WE SPENT AN AWFUL LOT OF TIME BEFORE THE END OF JANUARY. AROUND SB NINETY ONE. AND AT THIS MOMENT- WE HAVE POTENTIALLY FIVE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS THAT CAN GO OUT. AS FAR AS RUN RELIEF. OF THE LAST REPORT WE GOT WAS THAT AT THIS POINT ONLY FOUR HUNDRED MILLION HAS BEEN APPLIED FOR AND HOPING. OVER THE LAST WEEK THAT NUMBER'S GONE UP BUT- GIVEN THAT IT IS ONLY SIX WEEKS UNTIL. THE JUNE THIRTIETH DEADLINE WHEN ALL OF THE CURRENT EVICTION PROTECTIONS WILL GO AWAY- VERY MUCH ONE UNDERSTAND THE ADMINISTRATION'S PLANS ON NEXT STEPS AND- I'D ENCOURAGE WOULD REALLY LIKE. EVERYONE TO. START FOCUSING SIGNIFICANTLY ON THIS OF JUST HOW DO WE GET THE MONEY OUT AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN. AND HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT- WHEN THAT DEADLINE COMES WE DON'T SEE- VERY DIFFICULT CONSEQUENCES FOR RENTERS- LOVE SOME THOUGHTS ON ON WHERE THE CONVERSATION IS WITH REGARDS TO- RENT RELIEF. AND WHAT'S GOING ON WITH STRUGGLING TENANTS AND LANDLORDS. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND I WILL AT. BEGAN WITH THE A BRIEF RESPONSE AN OVERVIEW AND THEN ASK A MEMBER OF R. ICHIKI TEAM TO GIVE YOU SOME ADDITIONAL SPECIFICS I BET I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ENHANCE OUR BEAT THE RIGHT RELIEF PROGRAM WITH THE ADDITIONAL DOLLARS THAT ARE COMING IN FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BUT ALSO WITH THE ARE THE CHANGES THAT U. S. TREASURY HAS PROVIDED- JUST ABOUT A WEEK AND A HALF AGO WE RECEIVED NOTIFICATION FROM U. S. TREASURY. MAKING SIGNIFICANT ADMINISTRATIVE CHANGES THAT WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF INCORPORATING INTO THE APPLICATION PORTAL THAT WE BELIEVE WILL LEAD TO AN APPLICATION THAT IS- MORE AND- LESS EXPENSIVE OR LESS YOU KNOW DANCE AS IT'S CURRENTLY AT. AS A CURRENTLY YES I WE DO AT OUR YEAH OF COURSE- OR NOT ONLY SORT OF RELYING ON AN APPLICATION PORTAL WE DO HAVE A LOCAL PARTNER NETWORK. OF A COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH ASK CLASSES STATE TO ENSURE THAT THIS RESOURCE IS MADE AVAILABLE TO TENANTS AND LANDLORDS- A LOOK FORTINO TO WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE LEGISLATURE AS WE CONTINUE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS ON.

FOR TO BE ABLE TO GET LAUNCHED OF THE- YEAR BOB GOOD PROGRESS THAT WE'RE SPEAKING ALL YOUR PERCENT PERSPECTIVE AND A 100% GREERS- WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IS THAT THAT WOULD LIKELY OPEN UP THE DOOR MUCH MORE WIDELY.

WELL THERE'S A LOT OF OUR IT'S A COMBINED EFFORT IN TERMS OF ALL THE FUNDING THAT'S BEING PROPOSAL VARIOUS DIFFERENT- MEANS RIGHT. ALL IN AN EFFORT TO END HOMELESSNESS AND ACHIEVE A MEASURABLE GOAL TO ENSURE THE PEOPLE HOUSE HAVE HOUSING I'M JUST CURIOUS AS TO WHAT IS THE COORDINATED EFFORT THAT THE GOVERNOR IS PROPOSING AND HOW WILL WE ENSURE THAT THERE'S ACCOUNTABILITY TRANSPARENCY IN A MEASURABLE GOAL OF SUCCESS. AS TO HOW WE WILL GET THERE. YES THE GREAT QUESTION ADD CHAIR AND- YOU KNOW LET ME AND- JUST SAY THAT THE AGENCY THE BUSINESS CONSUMERS- SERVICES AND HOUSING AGENCY. HAS BEEN PLAYING A VERY IMPORTANT AND CRITICAL ROLE AND TERMS OF COORDINATING ALL OF OUR HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS ANNOUNCEMENTS. I S. IF THE SECRETARY OF THIS AGENCY AND ALSO WITH A DEEP YOUR PASSION AND- BACKGROUND IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING HAVE BEEN WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH. A BEAT THE LEADERS- BOTH BEING OUT THAT. ART DIRECTOR OF H. T. V. THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CALLAGY SAYING- THE DEPUTY. AND SECRETARY AND THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER WITHIN HDFC AND ALSO BRINGING AND OF COURSE OF THE PART IN THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING WHICH IS ALSO UNDER AGENCY. ALONG WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF REAL ESTATE. I AND I WORKING CLOSELY WITH- THAT ARE YOU KNOW THE TREASURER'S OFFICE. SO MUCH OF THE COORDINATION- CHAIR IS HAPPENING THROUGH OUR AGENCY- WE HAVE. AND ALSO INVESTING OUT SIGNIFICANTLY AND ESTABLISHING- DATA SYSTEMS THAT GIVE US A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IS HAPPENING ACROSS THE STATE. AS AN EXAMPLE THE HVAC. AS ANOTHER EXAMPLE HEP RECENTLY RELEASED AFTER HOUSING DATA VIEWER THAT GIVES A LOCAL- COMMUNITIES THE ABILITY TO SEE HOW THEY'RE DOING IN TERMS OF MEETING OF FAIR HOUSING GOALS. SO THAT THAT EFFORT OF COORDINATION AND INTEGRATION AND CONTESTING THIS HAPPENING. I'M THROUGH V. M. YEAH THE THROUGH OUR AGENCY LEADING THAT WORK- AND I WOULD SAY THAT YOU KNOW WE ARE VERY MUCH- ONLINE AND SHARE IN TERMS OF THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING METRICS AND- BEING ABLE TO HAVE BILLS AS PUBLIC METRICS OR- INFORMATION THAT WE CAN SHARE PUBLICLY SO THAT. WE ARE ALSO NOT ONLY TRACKING OUR PROGRESS. BUT ALSO I'M LOOKING AT AND WHERE WE NEED AT LEAST. JOURNAL TO OR NO WAY OF DOING I'M AT WORK. THANK YOU HAVE A VARIETY OF TO QUESTION AT THE FAR UP BUT I ALSO WANT GIVE MY- COLLEAGUES IN OPERA TO QUESTIONS AND- JUST A REMINDER THAT THERE'S A LOT OF INFORMATION THAT WE ARE JUST LEARNING ABOUT AS- AS WE TRY TO GET THROUGH THIS. VERY IMPACTFUL. HEARING OR WE HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENT ISSUE AREAS MISTER LUCKY I TURN IT OVER TO YOU. WELL THANK YOU AND- GOD I HOPE I CAN BE HEARD ALIVE. THERE WILL BE HEARD. YES I AM I WANTED JUST TO SAY FIRST OF ALL IT IS AN HONOR TO MEET YOU MADAM SECRETARY AND I KNOW YOU HAVE A HUGE RESPONSIBILITY. AND I CERTAINLY RESPECT IT AND I WANT TO JUST GIVE. A LITTLE FOOD FOR THOUGHT IN A LITTLE DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE I. I'D I'VE SEEN OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS THE HOUSING FIRST EMPHASIS- AND I THINK- HONKY THE LANKY PROGRAM IS ONE OF THOSE. AND I'VE I FEEL LIKE. OF THE CERTAINLY. HOUSING IS A CRITICAL FUNCTION. BUT THE I BELIEVE THAT SOMETHING THAT IS MUCH MORE POWERFUL AND- AND THE AND THE MEASURE OF SUCCESS OF ARE HOMELESS- EXPENSES. IS WHAT PEOPLE SEE ON THE STREETS AND I THINK ST HOMELESSNESS. HE HAS THE BEST MEASURE OF HOW SUCCESSFUL OUR PROGRAMS ARE. AND I THINK ONE HAVING. THE EXPERIENCE OF BEING A LAW ENFORCEMENT PROFESSIONAL FOR ALMOST THIRTY YEARS. ONE OF THE WAYS WE DEAL WITH A LOT OF THEM THE DYSFUNCTION IN OUR SOCIETY MR LAW ENFORCEMENT I THINK IT'S VERY UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE IT'S VERY- IT'S VERY INEFFECTIVE. AND IT'S VERY VERY TEMPORARY. AND I THINK THE HOUSING FOCUS IS ALSO TEMPORARY AND I THINK WELL WHAT WE NEED TO TRY TO DO IS TO SHIFTED. OUR OUR SERVICES SUPPORT FIRST- BECAUSE WE AS AS YOU KNOW THAT. A LARGE SHARE OF OUR HOMELESS POPULATION. BATTLE MENTAL ILLNESS ADDICTIONS AND ADAPTIVE BEHAVIOR DISORDERS AND I FEEL LIKE I DON'T SEE A WHOLE LOT OF. BUNDY GOING IN THAT DIRECTION AND I DON'T SEE A LOT OF PLANNING GOING IN THAT DIRECTION I THINK THAT THAT IS REALLY. HOW WE GET AT THE HEART OF THIS PROBLEM AND I THINK PART OF THE REASON WHY WE DON'T IS BECAUSE IT'S MUCH MORE DIFFICULT. AND I THINK IT'S TIME THAT WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE SERVICES. ARE UNDER EMPATHIZED AND I REALLY REALLY WOULD HOPE. THAT WE WOULD- START FOCUSING OUR ATTENTION ON THE DEMANDS OF THESE PROBLEMS AND TO ACTUALLY ADDRESS SERVICES FIRST SUPPORT SERVICES FOR SO THAT WE CAN HAVE SUSTAINABLE. RECOVERY WE CAN GET WE CAN GET SOMEBODY A PLACE TO STAY BUT IT'S NOT SUSTAINABLE UNLESS THEY HAVE. THE SKILLS AND THE TOOLS TO ADAPT. TO LIFE AND I'M HOPING THAT- WE CAN SEE MORE FUNDING AND MORE ORGANIZATION IN THAT DIRECTION BECAUSE- IF IT DOESN'T AND THIS PLAN IT'S HARD TO SEE. AND I THINK THAT'S A PROBLEM IT SHOULDN'T BE HARD TO SEE IT SHOULD BE BALANCED WITH THE WITH THE HOUSING. COMPONENT AND SO THOSE ARE JUST MY THOUGHTS YET YOU DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER THAT IT'S JUST A PERSPECTIVE I THINK IS VERY VERY CRITICAL AND I HOPE THAT- WE COULD SEE SOME ADAPT SOME OF THAT TATIAN. TO THAT PERSPECTIVE THANK YOU. ANY COMMENTS FROM SECRETARY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER- FOR AND THE- RIGHT YOU NEVER RAISING THE IMPORTANCE OF- SOCIAL SERVICES WE YOU KNOW COMPLETELY RECOGNIZE THAT ACT IT IS A COMBINED EFFORT AND I MAY ASK YOUR CHAIR- ALLEY A SUDDEN OUR DEPUTY SECRETARY FOR HOMELESSNESS SHE JUST MAYBE ELABORATE AND SPEAK A LITTLE BIT MORE AND- TOWARDS THE INVESTMENTS. THAT ARE COMING IN THROUGH THE AGENCY TO HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY AND THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES- MOST OF THE SOCIAL SERVICES AND HEALTH YOU KNOW SERVICE INVESTMENTS ARE COMING IN THROUGH- H. H. H. S. S. OUT AND HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY AND SO- ALLEY DO YOU WANNA GO HEAD IN CHINA AND- AFTER THE OTHER. I'LL BE REAL QUICK AND I WOULD SAY I THINK THAT THERE'S A LOT. THAT WE CAN ATTACK AROUND THE KILLING PROPOSAL AND MAKE SURE THAT WE'LL GET I DON'T WANT TO MISS IT AND WE CAN'T REALLY HEAR YOU CAN YOU SPEAK A LITTLE LOUDER PLEASE. YES SORRY I WILL DO MY VERY. I WOULD JUST SORT OF THING I THINK THAT THERE IS QUITE A BIT WITHIN THE CALLING PROPOSALS. THAT WOULD ADDRESS A LOT OF THAT IS. A LOT OF THE CONCERN YOU'RE SEEING. THAT THAT I WOULD I WOULD. I WOULD HAVE TO TAKE TO GET INTO MUCH DETAIL HERE AND SPEAK FOR THAT FOR THEM BUT- YOU KNOW SPECIFICALLY AROUND SOME OF THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE PIECES THAT WOULD INCLUDE SUPPORT AND SERVICES. A LOT OF THAT THEIR RENTAL ASSISTANCE EFFORTS THAT ARE HAPPENING WITHIN BOTH THE FAMILY HOMELESSNESS PART BUT ALSO. YOU KNOW WITHIN CURRENT FUNDING IS NOT JUST FOR HER HOUSING AND RENTAL ASSISTANCE THEY ALSO INCLUDES A LOT OF IT'S A PART OF SERVICES. LIKE THIS. I'M AND THEN WHICH WOULD ALSO JUST CALL OUT BECAUSE I THINK IT'S A SMALL PIECE OF IT BUT I THINK ARE REALLY CRITICAL ONE IS THERE'S ALSO A PROPOSAL AND THEY'RE- OUT OF FOR OUR DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS. ABOUT SUPPORTIVE SERVICES FOR VETERANS THAT HIGHLIGHTED BY HOMELESS ARE CURRENTLY HOMELESS. THAT WOULD REALLY GET A LOT OF THIS WORK TO DO SO JUST. APPRECIATING VERY MUCH THAT THAT WE COULD DO MORE AT TEN FRAME AND FLAG THOSE PIECES- BUT BUT. DO VERY MUCH BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE IN THEIR- THANK YOU FOR. I WE WILL COME. TO RIVER I KNOW THAT YOU AND I HAD A- AS- A- MEETING OF. WEEK OR SO AGO. WHERE SOME OF THE SAME- RUSSIANS WERE RAISED IN TERMS OF HOW DO WE ALIGNED. WHAT WE SEE IN BUDGETS OF FOR AND WHAT IS COMING OUT OF BUDGETS UP TO THAT'S RELATED TO WRAPAROUND SERVICES AND MENTAL HEALTH ASSISTANCE AND HELP ASSISTANCE IN GENERAL FOR OUR OWN HOUSE POPULATION. AS WE TRY TO ALSO DO THE WORK NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE PROVIDING HOUSING SO WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO. MERGE THE TWO SO THAT WE CAN HAVE AN OVERALL PICTURE. AS TO WHAT THE OVERALL- OUT RESULTS OF MEASUREMENTS WILL BE. MISTER COOPER. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR ABILITY COMMITTEE FOR SEVEN YEARS NOW WE TALK ABOUT THIS. YEAH WE'VE GOT SIX POINT EIGHT BILLION THIS BUDGET PREVIOUSLY WE'VE SPENT OTHER TWO BILLION OF HOMELESSNESS FOR- PROJECT ROOM KEY AND HOME KEY. INFALLIBLE MAKE YOU MISTER LACKEY'S COMMENTS. IT'S THE ADMINISTRATION IT. YOU NEVER HEAR THE ISSUES DEALING WITH MENTAL ILLNESS AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE WELL THE PRIMARY ISSUES. YOU CAN GO TO HOUSING YOU WANT THESE FOLKS DON'T HAVE THE CAPABILITY THE ABILITY. TO MAKE THAT DECISION TO MAKE THAT CHOICE IN ALL WANT TO MAKE IT FOR THEM. I'VE NEVER HEARD ANYONE FROM THE MISTRESS TALK ABOUT CONSERVATORSHIP SOME THESE FOLKS CANNOT MAKE A DECISION. AND WHAT WHAT'S THAT IS- THE JAILS HELD A LOT OF FOLKS WITH MENTAL ILLNESS THEY SHOULD NOT BE THERE. BUT I HAVE SEEN IN THERE THEY'VE GOT OKAY OR GOTTEN SOMEWHAT NORMAL ON MEDICATION. AND NO ONE'S EVER TALKED ABOUT THAT. MOST USEFUL CANNOT MAKE THOSE DECISIONS FOR THEMSELVES SOMEONE HAS TO MAKE THAT. AND TOLD THE ADMINISTRATION OR SOMEBODY ELSE. RECOGNIZE THAT TAKE FULL STEPS. THINGS ARE GONNA CHANGE. OF THIS THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE IN THE PUBLIC IS HOMELESSNESS IN DEALING WITH IT. WE'RE THROWING A LOT OF MONEY AT IT. ARE WE GONNA SOLVE IT I THINK. SOMEWHAT BUT TO REALLY DO A DEEP DIVE. INTO HAVE A HAVE A- LASTING AFFECT. IN WE ADDRESS THOSE. ISSUES WE'RE NOT GONNA MAKE A SNIFF IMPACT WE SAID IT TIME AND TIME AGAIN WE SAID IT LAST BUDGET CYCLE WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS ON THIS COMMITTEE AND IT HASN'T CHANGES HIS HOUSING HOUSING HOUSING HOUSING THE PART BUT IF YOU'RE UNABLE TO MAKE THAT DECISION ERRED THEY HAVE THE ABILITY BECAUSE OF WHATEVER IMPAIRMENT- IT JUST DOESN'T WORK AND YEAH THIS WRAPAROUND SERVICES IN THIS INCLUDE IN THERE SOME MIDDLE HEALTH AND SUBSIDIES BUT NOTHING OF SUBSTANCE THAT REALLY HELP THESE INDIVIDUALS DO THAT IN. THE PUBLIC TIRED OF THIS PUBLIC EXPECTS GOVERNMENT DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT AND THE REALLY- AGREE JUST CASES YOU SEE OUT THERE WE'RE DOING NOTHING FOR THEM. AT ALL SO AT SOME POINT OPCIONAL WAKES UP IN THE ADMINISTRATION A. N. N. HAS THE COURAGE TO DEAL WITH THAT AND TALK ABOUT CONSERVATORSHIP FOR SOME OF THE WORST CASE. THE WIDER MEET ME ON THE STREETS YOU KNOW SUMMERTIME IT'S HOT NOW AND- IT'S JUST A IN JUST AS WE'RE DOING THESE PEOPLE. SO HOPEFULLY THEY MISSED AND SOME TO SO TO DO SOME. THANK YOU MISTER COOPER ANNIE COMMENT FROM. THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. THE WHITE HOUSE. OUR COLLEAGUES FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO RESPOND. THIS IS CHRIS. CRYSTAL THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I WOULD LIKE TO BRIEFLY ADDRESS THE ATTACKS REYES REGARD WE ARE ON THE UP PERSON STRUGGLING WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AND OF THE TWELVE POINT. REALLY DON'T PACKAGE FORTUNATELY FORTY MILLION DOLLARS WAS TARGETED TOWARDS PERSONS WHO ARE ON MULTIPLE POPULATIONS. IT'S INCLUDES A TWO POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONSORTIUM INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. FOR THE HOUSING DISABILITY ADVOCACY PROGRAM- TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR HOME SAFE. AND ONE BILLION DOLLARS FOR COMMUNITY CARE EXPANSION. AND THEN TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR SUPPORTIVE SERVICES FOR VETERANS SO WE DO HERE WHAT MEMBERS ARE SAYING ME. WE APPRECIATE THE IMPORTANCE OF- REACHING OUT ALL ELEMENTS OF THE HOMES. POPULATION IN UNDER EARNING A SIGNIFICANT MONEY DISBURSED. OKAY THANK YOU FOR THAT- MISTER NAZARIAN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. GOT IT GOT THREE. QUICK QUESTIONS THAT I'D LIKE TO FOCUS ON AT FIRST- THANK YOU MADAM SECRETARY FOR BEING HERE WITH US- AND- AND I WANT TO FIRST LOOK AT THE. LITTER ABATEMENT PROGRAM THAT IS WELL OVERALL THE CALTRANS SUPPORT DOLLARS I SEE THAT IN THE EXPANDED CALTRANS COORDINATION AND DRESSING CAN'T MINCE ENCAMPMENTS THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT POTS FIFTY MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND FOR THE ENCAMPMENT RESOLUTION GRANTS AND THEN THE TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION FOR THE CALTRANS ENCAMPMENT COORDINATORS POINT PLAN. AND THAT IS A BIT OF A SEEMS LIKE A SMALL RELATIVELY SMALL AMOUNT GIVEN THE CONSTANT AND CONTINUED NEED IN HAVING TO ADDRESS THE SYSTEMIC ISSUES WITH- WITH ENCAMPMENTS THAT. ARE VERY SIMILAR TO FAVELAS SO THAT'S ONE BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT THERE'S A FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTEEN MILLION LITTER ABATEMENT PROGRAM SIDE WANT TO. UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT HOW THESE DIFFERENT FUNDS. ARE GONNA BE COORDINATING OR WORKING TOGETHER- SECOND. MANAGER I'M HAPPY TO ASK ALL THE QUESTIONS NOW OR KEEP IT ONE BY ONE. ALL AT ONCE. SECOND IS THAT- YOU KNOW THROUGH HAPPENED THAT WAS ESTABLISHED A FEW YEARS AGO WE HAD THE BENEFIT OF FLEXIBLE FUNDING- FOR SERVICES AND AS YOU CAN TELL FROM THE MYRIAD OF COMMENTS NOW THAT HAVE BEEN MADE EITHER BY. MR LACKEY THE CHAIR OR OR MISTER COOPER AND MR CHIU- WE CAN SPEND A LOT OF MONEY ON THE HOUSING AND- BUT THE NEED FOR INVESTING CRITICAL AND SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN SERVICES IS WHAT'S GONNA ALLOW US. TO GET OVER THE HUMP OF DEALING WITH SYSTEMIC HOMELESSNESS AND SO I WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE HAP COMMITMENT OR FLEXIBLE FUNDING COMMITMENT. IS GONNA BE THIRD- SOMETHING THAT I'VE FOCUSED ON FOR MANY YEARS NOW BEING IN THE LEGISLATURE BUT I'VE ALWAYS LOOKED AT IT FROM THE PRISM OF CAL- YES. AND NOT MUCH FROM THE HOUSING BUDGET BUT NOW I'M BRINGING IT INTO THE HOUSING CONVERSATION. GIVEN THIS ONE TIME OPPORTUNITY OF MAKING THIS. GIVEN THIS ONE TIME. SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT THAT WE CAN MAKE IS LOOKING AT A SEISMIC AN EARTHQUAKE RESILIENCY INVESTMENT- SOMETHING THAT WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT. WE'RE TALKING BECAUSE THE ABOUT PUTTING IN BILLIONS OF DOLLARS INTO HOMELESSNESS BUT ONE THING WE CONTINUE TO LACK. IN OUR VISION IS THAT WE ARE SITTING ON EIGHTY THOUSAND VULNERABLE HOUSING STRUCTURES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA EIGHTY THOUSAND. THESE ARE THESE INCLUDE SOFT STORY BUILDINGS AS WELL AS OLDER BRICK BUILDINGS DUCTLESS BUILDINGS THAT ARE POTENTIALLY JUST ONE MAJOR SEISMIC ACTIVITY AWAY FROM CRUMBLING DOWN AND A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF THESE BUILDINGS ARE IN THE HOPES OF THE BAY AREA AND GREATER LA AREA WHERE. GEOLOGICALLY THAT'S WHERE MOST OF THE SEISMIC ACTIVITY IS AND SO GIVEN WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT AT THE POTENTIAL- UNFORTUNATE CIRCUMSTANCE OF ONE MAJOR EARTHQUAKE BRINGING DOWN A LOT OF THESE BUILDINGS. AND THESE ARE. THE POOR CONDITION BUILDINGS THAT HOUSE THE MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. SO YOU CAN JUST IMAGINE TO WHAT EXTENT ARE HOMELESSNESS IS GOING TO EXPAND OVERNIGHT SO MUCH SO THAT FOR ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO ARIZONA STATE CONDUCTED A EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS EXERCISE IN ANTICIPATION OF POTENTIALLY FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS. LEAVING CALIFORNIA IN IN THE EVENT OF AN EARTHQUAKE AND REESTABLISHING THEMSELVES IN ARIZONA- THAT THAT NEWS HAS JUST STAYED WITH ME EVER SINCE AND IT JUST STRIKES ME THAT WE- WILL NOW HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT BUT I'M NOT SEEN. RESILIENCY DOLLARS IN MAKING SURE THAT THESE- THESE VULNERABLE BUILDINGS ARE ADDRESSED IN ADVANCE SO THAT WE'RE NOT DEALING WITH A GREATER NUMBER OF HOMELESSNESS SO IF YOU CAN. PLEASE PROVIDE RESPONSES TO ALL THREE QUESTIONS I'D APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. UNFORTUNATELY OUR SECRETARY HAD ANOTHER COMMITMENT AND INTENT TO HOP OFF AND BUT I WILL I WILL TAKE IT. I DON'T THINK THE FIRST ONE AND THEN MAYBE AND OVERNIGHT APARTMENT OF FINANCE NEEDS TV FOLKS FOR THE OTHER TWO- RELATED TO THE ENCAMPMENT PIECE- AND THE WORK THAT WILL BEGIN TO CALTRANS- HCFC HAS BEEN WORKING VERY VERY CLOSELY WITH CALTRANS. PARTICULARLY SINCE THAT THE PANDEMIC AND HELPING THINK THROUGH HOW TO KEEP- FOLKS THAT ARE THAT ARE ENCAMPMENTS PARTICULARLY ON STATE LANDS HOW TO KEEPTHEM SAFE I'M NOT ENSURE THAT THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS SAFE AND WHEN NEEDED HOW THAT HOW TO SAFELY MOVE FOLKS AND- DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND RESOLVING CAN'T RENT AND SO A LOT OF THE WORK. I'M THE STAFF THAT ARE THAT ARE RECOMMENDED FOR- CALTRANS IS FOR A LOT OF THT WORK THAT THEY HAVE BEEN DOING LOCALLY WE HAD HDFC WOULD ALSO HAVE A PIECE AND THAT OUR NATION WITH LOCAL ENTITIES I'M NOT HOMELESSNESS EXPERT SIDE AND GETTING FOLKS INTO PERMANENT HOUSING. AND THAT'S WHERE A LOT OF THAT GRANT FUNDING WOULD GO IS REALLY TARGETING I'M SPECIFIC ENCAMPMENTS PRIMARILY IN CAMPUS THAT ARE OVER FIFTY INDIVIDUALS REALLY HELPING. THOSE FOLKS INTO SAFER AND MORE PERMANENT HOUSING THAT SORT OF THOSE PIECES THE LETTER ABATEMENT PEACE IN THE PART OF THAT- AS WE KNOW WE CAN'T REMOVE ALL THESE CAMPAIGNS IMMEDIATELY THERE IS QUITE A BIT. OF LETTER EFFORTS THAT THAT THE CALTRANS IS CURRENTLY UNDERTAKING TO KEEP THOSE PHONES- ENCAMPMENTS AS CLEAN AS SAFE AS POSSIBLE AND WORK TO ACTUALLY MOVE OPENED A PERMANENT HOUSING SO THAT THAT IS WHERE THAT FUNDING COMES THEN. I WOULD MORE DETAIL AND WE PROBABLY NEED UPON OUR CALTRANS FOLKS BUT BUT WE HAVE BEEN COORDINATING WITH THEM QUITE CLOSELY AND I MATH PIECE- AND ARE ARE EXCITED TO CONTINUE THAT WORK AND LEARN. HOW BEST TO SUPPORT LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND ENDING CAN'T RESOLUTION- AND THEN RIGHT HANDED OVER TO OUR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE BROKE DOWN. ON THAT THE MORE FLEXIBLE FUNDING AND THAT RESILIENCY PIECES SO SKEWS ME JUST A FOLLOW UP THEN VERY QUICKLY WHICH IS FOR EXAMPLE THAT. FIFTY MILLION. INDIAN CAPITAL RESOLUTION GRANT. AND THE CALTRANS AND CORPS. OF TWO SEVEN. WE DO YOU EXPECT TO SEE HAPPEN WHAT WILL WHAT WITH IN THE- BASED ON. BUT I CALTRAIN GET MY- AND AGAIN IN MY ACTUAL GET OVER FINANCE TO TALKS ITS ITS FIRST BUT- I'M REALLY DO THEY'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF WORK WITH LOCAL COMMUNITIES TRYING TO FIGURE OUT AND HOW TO KEEP HOW TO KEEP THESE THE USING CANON SAFE AND WHEN NECESSARY TO RESOLVE THAT THERE'S A LOT OF JUST. TIENEN TENTATIVE OUT WORK BEING DONE AND SO THAT WOULD BE THE BIG LEAGUE HARPER SACK TO KEEP THAT WE'RE DOING AND EXPAND THE WORK THEY'VE BEEN THEY'VE BEEN DOING. ON THE FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS ON OUR END SOME OF THAT WOULD ALSO INCLUDE HDFC STAFF TO CONTINUALLY A SIGNING WITH WITH LOCAL COMMUNITIES BUT AND LARGE MAJORITY OF THAT THE FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS WILL GO FOR HIS HANDFUL OF COMMUNITIES. THAT ARE ALREADY STARTED THINKING THROUGH AND HAVE BROUGHT RESOURCES TO THE TABLE I'M KIND OF RESOLVE ANY TIRING CAN'T MANY MOVE FOLKS IN THE STATE FOR UNSTABLE HOUSING. WHERE THEY NEED ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO DO THAT AND LEARNING FROM IT SORT OF WHERE THEY HAVE GREATER INNOVATIVE WAYS TO DO THAT- THE EXPECTATION S THAT WE WOULD BE USING THOSE FUNDS FOR VERY TARGET AND THANK YOU EVENTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT WE THINK WE CAN FULLY RESOLVED. AND THE FOLKS AND A PERMANENT HOW THE ENTIRE COME. IN CANADA CANADIAN DEPARTMENT. MR FRIEDMAN. THE LOCAL. BUSINESS THERE AND I WANTED TO FOLLOW UP AND QUESTION THAT BE. IN MY IN MY CA. AND LIKE YOU MENTIONED AND- PARTS OF L. COUNTY AND ACROSS THE STATE. STATE PROPERTY IN CALTRANS. IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO GET CALTRANS TO GO OUT TO A PROPERTY JUST FOR BASIC CLEAN UP TO BEGIN WITH. THEN THERE'S ALL OF THE- TRASH AND DEBRIS AND HUMAN WASTE THAT IS. LEFT OVER AND TURNED KAMIN SAID MISS AND I HEAR YOU SAY I HEARD YOU SAY. THESE SPECIFIC INDIVIDUALS WOULD BE TO KEEP ENCAMPMENTS SAFE. CAN YOU ELABORATE ON WHAT THAT ACTUALLY MEANS BECAUSE WE HAD A RECENT AND CAPMAN CLEANED WHERE WE FOUND A LOT OF. UNFORTUNATELY NEEDLES DRUGS A LOT OF. A LOT OF THINGS THAT REALLY ACTUALLY SHOULDN'T BE ON THE STREET AND SO EASILY ACCESSIBLE AND COMMUNITIES AND SO I'M JUST CURIOUS AS TO. WHAT THE TRANSITION ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE AND WHAT IS THE MEASUREMENT OF SUCCESS TO KEEP. CALTRANS AND STATE PROPERTY CLEAN. AND NOT TO WITH ADDITIONAL ENCAMPMENTS ONCE THOSE INDIVIDUALS HAVE BEEN SAFELY MOVED. INTO MORE PERMANENT HOUSING. YEAH I THOUGHT MAYBE AND JUST TALKING THROUGH THAT A RANGE OF INTERVENTIONS RIGHT SO THAT THAT LED OUR BASEMENT I THINK THERE'S ALSO AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT ARE FINANCE SPOKESMAN MRS WELL THAT IS SORT OF AT A HAZARDOUS WASTE CLEANUP PIECE OF BAD PROPOSAL AS WELL. BOTH OF THOSE ARE REALLY INTENDED TO TRY TO KEEP THE ISLANDERS THAT THAT'S SORT ONGOING CAMPAIGN SETTINGS THAT'S HELPING. ME OUT THAT LETTER HELP KEEP THEM AS SAFE AS POSSIBLE WHILE WE TRY TO TRANSITION INTO PERMANENT HOUSING REQUIRED BUT THAT WOULD BE STATEWIDE. THE FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS WOULD BE VERY TARGETED TOWARDS SPECIFIC. HOMELESS ENCAMPMENTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT WE THINK WITH SOME ADDITIONAL FUNDING WE COULD RESULT BEING TIRING CANNOT MOVE ALL OF THOSE FOLKS AND A PERMANENT HOUSING AND THEN CALTRANS OR THE LOCAL COMMUNITY COULD COULD FIGURE OUT WAYS TO ENSURE THAT THAT PROPERTY IS. THE CERTIFICATE CARE AND THERE'S NOT AN ADDITIONAL. ARGUMENT THAT THAT POPS UP. AND JEFF YOU KNOW MY NAME I AND TO BUILD UPON WHAT THE MADAM CHAIR. ASTON OR MAYBE JUST COMPLEMENT WHAT SHE'S SAYING. WHAT WHAT EXACT. WHO WHO'S GONNA BE IN CHARGE OR THEY'RE GONNA BE MATRIX EXPECTED TO BE RECEIVED. AND AS WE CONSTANTLY RUN INTO THIS PROBLEM SO I YOU KNOW THIS IS A THIS IS A CRISIS WITH THAT NO ONE WANTS TO SEE GO TO WASTE. IF WE CAN BE MAKING INVESTMENTS THAT WE KNOW WE CAN GET RESULTS FOR WHO'S GOING TO BE IN CHARGE. TO BE RECEIVING THE DOCUMENTATION OF WHAT WAS EXACTLY DONE WITH THE DOLLARS THAT ARE BEING INVESTED. YES OVER THE FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT'S FULLY HDFC- THE BEAUTY OF AGI AFTER THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO TRACK- HOUSING OUTCOMES THAT LONG TERM HOUSING SUSTAINABILITY. FOR ANYBODY THAT IS RECEIVING SERVICE THAT FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN THE ENCAMPMENTS ON W. AND SO WE GARY MATCH EXPECT THAT THERE WILL BE AN ONGOING. DATA ANALYSIS. FROM THE FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS TO DETERMINE- HOW THOSE FOLKS HAVE MOVED IN HOUSING HAVE BETWEEN AND WITHIN THE HOUSING AND HOW LONG THEY WERE ABLE TO MAINTAIN THAT HOUSING THAT HAPPENED EXACTLY. AND WHO WILL BE AND WHO WILL BE THE- INSTITUTION OR THE PERSON IN CHARGE. OR. L. OR RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS. FINALLY IT COMING TO THE HOMELESS COURT MEETING IN COMES THAT WE BE OKAY. ARE AND OKAY THANK AND THEN- AS FOR THE OTHER TO THE HAP WERE TO FLEXIBLE FUNDING AND THE RESILIENCE FUNDING. BRITAIN IS ALSO DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO THE BUDGET CURRENTLY DOES NOT INCLUDE ANY FLEXIBLE FUNDING BUT WE ARE OPEN TO HAVE-CONVERSATIONS WITH THE LEGISLATURE ABOUT WHAT FLEXIBLE FUNDING WOULD LOOK LIKE. AND WHAT ACCOUNTABILITY OF THOSE FUNDS WILL LOOK LIKE I ALSO WANT TO NOTE THAT THE FUNDING FOR HELP TWO POINT OH HAS NOT GOING ON GOING OUT YET INTERVIEWS MULTI YEAR AVAILABILITY FOR THAT FUNDING. AND I'LL MOVE ON TO YOUR YOUR QUESTION ABOUT RESILIENT COMMUNITIES THERE IS TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND IN THE BUDGET FOR THIS PURPOSE. I DON'T KNOW ALL THOSE DETAILS AS IT FALLS ON A DIFFERENT POLICY AREA BUT I CAN CERTAINLY GO BACK TO MY COLLEAGUES A FINANCE AND GET THOSE DETAILS TO YOU. I THINK WE WOULD LIKE THAT VERY MUCH. GETTING THE DETAILS TO THIS PROPOSAL IN PLAN WOULD HELP US REALLY WORK WITH YOU IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET TO A GOOD SPACE WHICH I THINK IS THE DIRECTION THE MISTER NAZARIAN IS HEADING UP. SURE IT'S CALLED THE PREPARE CALIFORNIA INITIATIVE IF YOU. WANT TO LOOK FORWARD IN THE BUDGET SOMEWHERE BUT I WILL GET THOSE SPECIFIC DETAILS TO YOUR STAFF THANK YOU. AND MENTORED DECREES APARTMENT A FINANCES MIGHT ALSO ADD ON A SPECIFICALLY TO SOME OF THE HOUSING PROPOSALS THAT COULD BE COVERED. OKAY COVER SEISMIC RETROFITTING- JUST WANT TO KNOW THAT POTENTIALLY REAP OR THE IMPLEMENTATION AND- PLANNING GRANTS. TO GO TOWARDS US I THINK RETROFITTING AS WELL AS OUR PRESERVATION PROPOSAL- AND A- OUR INFLUENCES SUCH A GRANT PROPOSAL THAT WE HAD- FROM THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ENABLE ONE. UNDER COULD ALSO GO TOWARDS ISAAC RETROFITTING. THANK YOU AND MISTER CHRIS THANK YOU FOR THAT I ACTUALLY HAD A FOLLOW UP QUESTION ON THE REAP FUNDING AND HOW IT WILL ACTUALLY BE DISTRIBUTED CAN YOU ELABORATE A LITTLE BIT ON THAT. CERTAINLY SO FOR THE REFUNDING IT'S LARGELY TO MIRROR KIND OF HOW OF ROOF WAS DONE IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. WE ARE LOOKING TOWARDS- HAVING THE FUNDING GO OUT TOWARDS WE TO ENTITIES IN THIS CASE THE- THE COUNCILS OF GOVERNMENTS. OR A METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION- COMMITTEE OR SOME OF THE- AS WITH THE CURRENT REPROGRAMMED. IF THERE ARE NO OF. SUCH ENTITIES ENTERED AS CERTAIN AREAS THAN A WORKING GROUP MULTI AGENCY GROUP. OF THE FUNDING TO GO TOWARDS THEM. ALLOCATED- ALLOCATED TOWARDS THEM. IS THERE IS A DETAILED PROPOSAL TO YOU CAN ALSO SEND OVER WITH REGARDS TO THE DISTRIBUTION OF REFUNDS. YES SO MENTAL WE'RE WORKING TOWARDS. FINALISING THE ULTRA LIBERAL THAT CAN PROVIDE SOME MORE INFORMATION AS TO THE ALLOCATION AND- I CAN PROVIDE THAT ONCE THAT IS- FINALIZED. THANK YOU. MISTER NAZARIAN ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS. OKAY OKAY. BEFORE WE MOVE FORWARD- I ACTUALLY DO HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS THAT I WANTED TO. ADDRESS AND REALLY RELATING TO. YOUTH HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS CAN YOU PLEASE ELABORATE AS TO WHAT THE PLAN IS TO ENSURE THAT- YOUTH HOMELESSNESS IS ALSO ADDRESSED. GET AFTERNOON VENTURE MEMBERS DANA CRUZ DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I COULD TAKE A STAB AT US IN THE HOUSING PROPOSES AND THEN REFER TO- MY COLLEAGUES YOU CAN ADD FURTHER- WE ARE PROPOSING- FIVE MILLION GENERAL FUND ONGOING FOR FOSTER'S FORMER FOSTER CARE YOUTH AGES EIGHTEEN THROUGH TWENTY ONE I NAVIGATORS HOPE THAN A SIXTY FIVE HOUSING STABILITY AS WELL AS MICHAEL I'M GOING A TRANSITIONAL HOUSING- HOUSING STABILITY SERVICES FOR. ACTIONS IS A GROUP OF EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE- OF FORMER FOSTER YOUTH OR EVEN- FOR PROBATION- A YOUTH- AND HAVING TO PASS IT OVER TO YOU- IF YOU'RE AFTER SIGNED- IF. SHE HAS ANYTHING ELSE TO ADD FOR THE HOME SIDE. YEAH ABSOLUTELY AND SO I THAT ALSO A GOOD AMOUNT I WAS TRYING TO PULL IT UP HERE THERE'S SO MUCH- BUT THAT THERE'S NOT A LARGE CHUNK THAT IS ALSO GOING FOR STUDENT HOMELESSNESS SPECIFICALLY IT DO YOU THINK HE'S- A LITTLE BIT LOUDER PLACE YOU'RE YOU'RE FADING IN. YOUR AUDIO. VERY SORRY ABOUT THAT I THINK I'M HAVING BAD TIMES INTERNET TODAY APOLOGIES FOR THAT. IT WAS JUST I'M ALSO MENTIONING THAT THERE IS. A CHUNK OF FUNDING TAT I WILL HAVE A NUMBER FOR HERE JUST A SECOND- AROUND SEAT FOR FIRST YOU HOMELESSNESS WITH CSU'S. ADAMS COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND THE UC SYSTEM AND SO I'M I'M KIND OF LOOKING TO SEE IF HE IS THE EXACT A DOLLAR ON THAT- ARE AMAZING FOR IT. I HAVE BIRTH BRITNEY THOMPSON TO PARTLY FINANCE. YES ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AT THE STATE COLLEGES FOR STUDENT HOMELESSNESS. IN ADDITION TO THE PROPOSAL TO BAN OUTLINED THERE'S ALSO. EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE TRANSITIONAL HOUSING PROGRAM WHICH IS FOR A PRIORITY GIVEN TO FORMER FOSTER YOUTH. AND THEN THERE'S GOING TO BE A 8% YOU SET ASIDE IN HOME KEY. THANK YOU FOR THE TECH THE TO THAT I'M TO TAKE TERMS OF HOW WILL A PROJECT HOME KEY B. SIGNIFICANT. FACTOR IN ENSURING SO. THE HOUSING FOR YOUNG PEOPLE BUT THERE'S THREE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS THAT I HEARD YOU TALK ABOUT. ONE IS A FOSTER YOUTH SECOND IS STUDENT- HOMELESSNESS AND THEN TRANSITIONAL HOUSING. SO HOW DOES ALL OF THAT COMPARED TO- EFFORTS THAT WERE MADE IN THE PAST. AND I WOULD I WOULD JUST MENTION REAL QUICKLY ON THE PHONE KEY PIECE THAT IS CRITICAL IN TERMS OF THAT WILL BE A PERMANENT HOUSING I PLACE IT FOR YOU SO WHEN YOU'RE THINKING THROUGH THE FULL THE FULL RANGE AND WE WILL HAVE A TRANSITIONAL HOUSING AND FOSTER YOUTH AND STUDENT WE ALSO HAVE PERMANEN HOUSING EFFORTS TO COMPETE. I'M ABOUT 8% I THINK ALL OF THAT- WILL THEN. THE STUDENT HOMELESSNESS PROPOSAL. THERE HAVE BEEN THINK YOU KNOW TO. THE DAYCARE BEEN OF THAT WORK OR BEING DONE I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A- SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THOSE FINDINGS BUT BRITNEY IN DATA YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO SPEAK TO THAT MARK. ON ALL OF THIS IS VERY MUCH BUILDING ON WHAT YOU'VE DONE AND YOU CAN COUNT. AYE WE HAVE SEEN COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE REALLY DOUBLING DOWN. ON EFFORTS WITH USE HOMELESSNESS AND UNDERSTANDING THAT POPULATION BETTER AND WHAT IS MORE WHAT IS MOST NEEDED FOR THAT POPULATION. SO WE WOULD EXPECT THAT THESE RESOURCES ARE VERY WELCOME PARTICULARLY THE HOME KEY EFFORTS I THINK WILL BE PARTICULARLY WELCOMING COMMUNITIES. THAT I STARTED UNDERSTANDING. THE POPULATION BETTER AND HOW BEST TO SERVE THEM. THANK YOU FOR THEM IS MISTER. THE FOUR HUNDRED MILLION BEING INVESTED AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE LEVEL THE CSU IN THE UC. HOW WILL THAT BE THIS DISTRIBUTED WHAT IS THE PROGRAM MANAGEMENT LOOK LIKE. THREE THOUSAND IF I. SO FUNDING SPREAD ACROSS CAL COMMUNITY CALL. CAL STATE YOU. AND TO USE.

THANK YOU AND IN FACT CAN YOU WALK ME THROUGH THE PROCESS SO I'M A STUDENT AT AT A COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND I NEED ASSISTANCE WHERE DO I GO. WHO'S IN CHARGE. I DON'T HAVE THE SPECIFICS ON THAT BUT I CAN CERTAINLY GET THAT FOR YOU AND YOUR STAFF. HOW AND THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY INCREDIBLY IMPACTFUL- PIECE TO DIVE INTO IN TERMS OF HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT OUR STUDENTS AND YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO RESOURCES BUT I'M ALSO VERY CONCERNED IN TERMS OF LIKE THE MANAGEMENT OF THESE FUNDS AND HOW EXACTLY ON THE GROUND LEVEL SOMEBODY THE NEEDS ASSISTANCE CAN ACTUALLY- OBTAINED RESOURCES AND FIND OUT HOW TO GET INFORMATION. AND IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ALSO NEED TO WORK ON THEN YOU KNOW WE SHOULD FIGURE THAT PIECE OUT. SURE I'M GONNA WALK THROUGH ON HOW TO ACCESS THE FUNDING TO MAKE SURE TO STUDENTS ARE ABLE TO EFFICIENTLY AND QUICKLY ACCESS EIGHT DIGITAL DETAILS. THANK YOU- ONE FINAL QUESTION AND FOR THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE IS CAN THE DEPARTMENT EXPLAIN WHY THE AYE AYE G. PROGRAM CONCENTRATES ON BROWNFIELD. HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE FOR THE TYPICAL IG PROJECT TO BE COMPLETED HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO- BROWN FOR PROJECT I'M SORRY TO BE COMPLETED AND SHOULD THE LEGISLATURE FOCUS ON MORE SHOVEL READY READY PROJECTS. SANTA CRUZ DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I GOING THE SENATE THE BROWN TO REMEDIATE ISSUE IN THEN PLAN TO THE- IF HAVE ANYTHING ELSE TO ADD.

PUT THAT ON THE TABLE THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I PERSONALLY WANT TO- REALLY DIVE INTO A LITTLE BIT DEEPER AND REALLY ENSURE THAT. THIS BUDGET. ALLOWS FOR A REFLECTION OF OUR VALUES IN WHICH YOUTH HOMELESSNESS IS ALSO REFLECTED IN A WAY THAT ACTUALLY OFFER SOME ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE OUTSIDE OF THE- THE GROUPS THAT WERE MENTIONED.

WHICH CERTAINLY SAVE LIVES IN WHICH THAT HAS NOW MADE CALIFORNIA ONE OF THE PLACES OF LOWEST KOBE TRANSMISSION IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY ALSO REQUIRED TREMENDOUS SACRIFICE AND THE SACRIFICES LIKE THE EFFECTS OF THE PANDEMIC ITSELF WERE NOT BORN EQUALLY WORKERS OF COLOR LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS WOMEN HAVE BEEN PARTICULARLY HARD HIT. THIS IS AND SOME CASES WHOLE INDUSTRIES WERE ESSENTIALLY SHUT DOWN OVERNIGHT AND WORKERS HAVE PAID THE PRICE BOTH ON THE FRONT LINES AND ON THE UNEMPLOYMENT LINES. WE HAVE HAD MANY DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE CHALLENGES THAT UNEMPLOYED WORKERS HAVE FACED ALL OF US NOT JUST MY TEAM AT THE LABOR AGENCY BUT ALSO YOUR STAFF HAVE WORKED COLLECTIVELY WITH EDTA TRYING TO ADDRESS THEM. AND THIS WORK OF COURSE IS ONGOING AND THE PROPOSED BUDGET INCLUDES SIGNIFICANT ONE TIME INVESTMENTS TO ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES AND SHORTCOMINGS THAT PREDATED THE PANDEMIC. WHAT WERE MADE IMPOSSIBLE TO IGNORE BY IT. THIS INCLUDES BENEFITS SYSTEMS MODERNIZATION SOMETHING THAT EDT STARTED BEFORE THE PANDEMIC BUT WE ARE NOW FORCED TO AND HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO THINK REALLY DIFFERENTLY ABOUT WHAT A MODERN SYSTEM BASED ON GOOD TECHNOLOGY. ALSO WITH A HUMAN CENTERED CLAIMANTS CENTERED A VISION COULD LOOK LIKE- AND SO THIS BUDGET- PROPOSES TO- PICK UP THAT WORK AGAIN- AND THAT WORK WAS PUT ON HOLD WHILE EDT FOCUSED ON MEETING THE IMMEDIATE NEEDS OF THE PANDEMIC. AND WE ARE FORCED TO RELY ON THE EXISTING SYSTEM TO DO SO- IT ALSO INCLUDES IN THE EDT BUCKET- MONEY TO IMPLEMENT DIRECT DEPOSIT SOMETHING YOU HAVE ALL RAISED AS WELL AS WE HAVE INTERNALLY TALKED ABOUT- THIS WILL. BOTH ADDRESS THE NEED FOR PROMPT PAYMENTS AND ALSO- HAVE A SAFEGUARDS AGAINST FRAUD. WELL THERE'S ALSO A PROPOSAL TO HAVE YOU Y. NAVIGATORS AT THE- AMERICAN JOB CENTERS SO- EXPANDING IMPROVING SUSTAINABILITY OF UP PEOPLE TO ASSIST CLAIMANTS WHEN THEY NEED IT- THAT EIGHT. IT. ALSO IT IS MILLION DOLLAR- ITEM FOR DEFERRED WORKLOADS THIS IS WORKLOAD ASSOCIATED WITH THE PANDEMIC SEARCH AND THEN THERE IS- TWENTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS TO SUPPORT- EDT LANGUAGE ACCESS INITIATIVE AGAIN SOMETHING THAT YOU ALL AND I STARTED WANTING KNOWLEDGE ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU LEADERSHIP ON THIS- TO ENSURE ACCESS TO IMPROVE MULTI LINGUAL SERVICES- IT ALSO INCLUDES GRANTS TO CBO'S TO PROVIDE OUTREACH EDUCATION TO THOSE LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENT COMMUNITIES- THIS BILL IS ON THE VISION THAT THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS HAD OF WORKING IN CONJUNCTION WITH CBO'S WHAT THE TRUST OF COMMUNITIES THAT WE NEED TO SERVICE. AND DIRECTOR REDESIGNS IS ALSO HERE TODAY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE ABOUT THESE ITEMS WHAT WE ALSO KNOW IS THAT BEFORE THE PANDEMIC EVEN PEOPLE WHO WERE EMPLOYED WERE NOT ENJOYING THE QUALITY OF JOBS LIVABLE WAGES HEALTH BENEFITS JOB SECURITY UNION PROTECTIONS UPWARD MOBILITY AND OTHER ASPECTS OF THE JOB THAT WE WANT FOR OURSELVES FOR OUR LOVED ONES AND FOR ALL WORKERS CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY LIKE THAT THE NATION'S FASTING GROWTH IN BOTH HIGH WAGE JOBS AND LOW WAGE JOBS BUT A HOLLOWING OUT OF THE MIDDLE CLASS AND A DECLINING SHARE OF WORKERS WHO RECEIVE HEALTH BENEFITS RETIREMENT BENEFITS IMPORTANT SOURCES OF ECONOMIC SECURITY AND KEY MEASURES OF JOB QUALITY. AND WE KNOW THAT NOT ALL REGIONS OF CALIFORNIA HAVE FULLY PARTICIPATED IN CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMIC SUCCESS PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ALL PARTICIPATE IN A VIBRANT ECONOMY THAT WE ARE GOING TO BUILD AND SO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WHAT WE CALLED THE CALIFORNIA COME BACK PLAN PROPOSES TO NEARLY ONE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN AN ECONOMIC RESILIENCE AND JOBS PACKAGE TO TACKLE THE CHALLENGES HAT WERE BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE PANDEMIC BUT ALSO THAT EXISTED BEFORE. IT ACKNOWLEDGES THAT BAD JOBS. ARE CHOICE JUST AS GOOD JOB BOB CHOICE AND THROUGH THE- INVEST. YOU ARE TO THE THAT WE- TO PAUL DECISIONS THAT WE MAKE WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENT CHOICE SO WE ARE THE PROPOSAL LOOKS AT REBUILDING OUR ECONOMY. AND ALSO REVERSING THE DECADES LONG TRENDS BEFORE THE PANDEMIC OF GROWTH IN LOW WAGE JOBS AND GOOD THE GROWING GAP BETWEEN THE RICH AND POOR. AND THIS BUDGET REALLY- LACES STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS IN HOW WE DELIVER ON ON ON THAT WORK. IT INCLUDES A SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR COMMUNITY ECONOMIC RESILIENCE FUND FOCUSED ON BOTTOM UP PLANNING FOR EACH REGION RECOGNIZING THAT ONE SIZE DOESN'T FIT ALL AND THAT WE HAVE TO BE INTENTIONAL ABOUT WHAT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND GROWTH ARE GONNA LOOK LIKE WE HAVE TO BE INTENTIONAL ABOUT JOB CREATION. IN THE LANGUAGE OF ECONOMIST WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THE DEMAND SIDE FOR LABOR. AND THE GOVERNOR'S PLAN ALSO INCLUDES ROUGHLY THREE HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS TO GET WORKERS INTO THOSE GOOD JOBS IT INCLUDES BUILDING BRIDGES BETWEEN COMUNICADO EDGES AND I WORKFORCE AGENCIES IT'S ABOUT TRANSFORMING OUR WORKFORCE SYSTEM SO THAT WE ARE TRULY PREPARING WORKERS FOR THE JOBS OF THE FUTURE WE'RE MEETING EMPLOYER NEEDS AND WE'RE COMBATING THE SYSTEMIC EXCLUSION OF THOSE WHO. WALKING BEHIND EVEN IN GOOD TIMES SO THIS IS ABOUT THE SUPPLY SIDE OF LABOR AND WE CANNOT DO JUST ONE WE HAVE TO DO BOTH OF THOSE THINGS AND THIS BUDGET REFLECTS THAT SO EACH OF THESE TWO PIECES HAS TWO CATEGORIES UNDER IT- SO REALLY FOUR PIECES THAT COMPLEMENT ONE ANOTHER THAT ARE THAT ARE REALLY INTERLOCKING. SO FIRST ON THE SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR FUND THIS IS AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT FUNDING THAT WOULD TREAT THIS COMMUNITY ECONOMIC RESILIENCE FUND THE TWO COMPONENTS ONE IS PLANNING IT WILL PROVIDE PLANNING GRANTS TO EACH OF THE STATE'S REGION'S RECOGNIZING THAT I SAID THAT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND GROWTH STRATEGIES HAVE TO COME BOTTOM UP BY THOSE WHO KNOW THE REGION'S BEST WHO KNOW THEIR ASSET ASSETS WHO CAN ALIGN THE REGION'S. STRENGTHS ALONG WITH THEIR CHALLENGES WHO CAN LOOK AT HOW TO ECONOMICALLY DIVERSIFY EACH REGION FOR LONGER TERM RESILIENCE AND THAT WILL ALSO REFLECT THE ADMINISTRATION'S COMMITMENT TO CLIMATE AND EQUITY AND ACCESS SO- THE THAT THAT FUNDING WILL GO TOWARD HIGH ROAD TRANSITION COLLABORATIVE'S WORKER VOICES ARE HEARD WHAT INDUSTRY MEETING LABOR AND MANAGEMENT COME TOGETHER AND WE'LL BE HEARD. ACROSS CALIFORNIA'S DIVERSE REGIONS THE BILL AND QUEST LIKE WILL WE THE JOB OF ARGUE. WHERE WILL THE JOBS COME FROM SO THE FIRST PART OF THAT IS PLANNING GRANTS THE SECOND PART OF THAT AGAIN THE TO UNDER THE FUND THE SECOND PIECE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PLANS THAT COME. INTO ACTION- IMPLEMENTING REGIONAL ECONOMIC PLANS. AND IMPLEMENTING WHAT THIS INCLUSIVE PROCESS- COMES UP WITH SO THAT WERE ACTUAL THE- CREATING STRONG INDUSTRIES WITH GOOD JOBS IN THEM ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THEN HE SAID GO UNDER THE WORK FORCE THE JOB READY INSIDE. THAT'S THE DEMANDS. ONE IS HOW DO WE CREATE STRONG TRAINING PROGRAMS THAT TALK WAYS- IN AN EQUITABLE WAY AND THESE ARE INVESTMENTS IN A HIGH ROE TRAINING PARTNERSHIPS AND HYBRID CONSTRUCTION CAREERS- THE BUDGET PROPOSED AN ADDITIONAL NINETY MILLION DOLLARS ON TOP OF THE TWENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN THE ORIGINAL. TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND THIS WILL ADDRESS INDUSTRIES IN DEMAND GROWTH INDUSTRIES LIKE HOSPITALITY TRANSPORTATION HEALTH CARE- AND OTHERS THESE ALSO ALIGNED WITH OTHER PARTS OF THE BUDGET AND OTHER PARTS OF OUR ECONOMY RIGHT JOBS. THAT INCLUDE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES- HOUSING- WOULD YOU JUST HEARD ABOUT RIGHT TRANSPORTATION- AND ALSO HAS THE FUNDING FOR THE EMPLOYMENT TRAINING PANEL. TO FIND I. T. ADVANCED MANUFACTURING HEALTHCARE AND PUBLIC SECTOR JOBS TO TRADE ABOUT TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND WORKERS THESE ARE SECTORS THAT ARE NOT CURRENTLY COVERED UNDER ETP- SO THERE'S THAT THOSE TRAINING PIECES- THAT ALLOW. THAT THAT FIT INTO OTHER- PRIORITIES IN THE BUDGET AND PARTIES TO MAKE CALIFORNIA YOU'RE JUST HELP CALIFORNIA PLAN FOR THE FUTURE AND THE LAST PIECE IS INVESTMENTS IN THE STATE'S WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS. THAT STRENGTHEN THE LINKS BETWEEN COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND WORKFORCE PROGRAMS SO- REALLY YOU KNOW IT'S A HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS TO IMPROVE THOSE PARTNERSHIPS- OF THIS KIND OF FIFTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS COMPLIMENTS THE FUNDS I JUST TALKED ABOUT TO H. I. T. P.'S HRC SEES. REALLY ADDRESSING A LONGSTANDING CRITIQUE THAT OUR EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS AND PATHWAYS DO NOT CORRELATE TO CURRENT AND FUTURE QUALITY JOBS SO FOR INTERLOCKING COMPONENTS UNDER TWO BIG BUCKETS ONE IS THE THAT THE PLANNING FOR THE KINDS OF JOBS WE WANT TO KIND OF IT KIND OF WOULD HAVE REGION BY REGION. AND THE OTHERS HOW WE GET PEOPLE CALIFORNIANS ESPECIALLY THOSE USUALLY GET LEFT OUT IT INTO THOSE JOBS THE LAST THING I JUST WANT TO SAY IS THAT WELL. SO MUCH ABOUT THE LAST YEAR WAS NOT WORSE. SOME OF THE THAT REFLECT IN THE IN THIS CALIFORNIA COME BACK PLAN IN THIS NEW REVISED ARE THE RESULT OF SEEDS THAT WERE PLANTED BEFORE THE PANDEMIC. AND AS WE'VE SEEN THE LAST YEAR AS MANY OF OUR CONVERSATIONS HAVE BEEN ABOUT WE CANNOT. FIX THE LEAKY ROOF ON THE HOUSE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STORM SO WE ARE EXCITED ABOUT THE INVESTMENT IN STRONG. AND THE STRONG WITH THAT HAS BEEN DONE BEFORE AND THE LEADERSHIP OF TIM RAINEY OF THE CALIFORNIA WILL PUT YOU ON THE BOARD AND READ HAVE YOU HEARD OF THE EMPLOYMENT TRAINING PANEL AND BOTH OF THEM ARE ALSO HERE TO ANSWER YOUR SPECIFIC QUESTIONS. ABOUT THOSE INVESTMENTS THAT WORK WAS. INVESTING IN HIGH ROAD JOBS AND WORKFORCE INNOVATION- AND APPRENTICESHIPS- AND OPPORTUNITIES AND SO- WE GET THAT THE BUDGET BUILT ON THE WE COULDN'T DO THESE THINGS WITHOUT THE ONE THAT HAD BEEN DONE IN A PRIOR AND THE BEST IS THAT YOU ALL HAVE. A B. TWO PRIOR ALSO AND I JUST WANT TO KNOWLEDGE OUR COLLEAGUES AT THE OFFICE OF PLANNING RESEARCH TAKE PART IN A STERILE WHITE STAIRS ALSO ON TO ANSWER QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE ABOUT THIS. AND WE HAD A FUTURE FOR COMMISSION EFFORT THAT THAT'S ALSO REFLECTED ALL OF THIS TO WRITE YOUR COLLEAGUE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER ASH KALRA WAS ON THAT COMMISSION THAT COMMISSION RECOMMENDED JOB FOR EVERY CALIFORNIA WHO WANTS ONE PARTICULARLY JOBS THAT MEET OUR CLIMATE GOALS LOOK YET TIME IT DOES NOT JUST OPPORTUNITY FOR CLEAN. WATER AND CLEAN AIR BUT ALSO GOOD JOBS. ARE HELD IS BEING- INVESTMENTS NOT JUST OPPORTUNITIES TO COMBAT HOMELESSNESS AND AFFORDABILITY ISSUES BUT ALSO CREATING GOOD JOBS SO- SO ARE. THESE INVESTMENTS REFLECT THAT- IT REFLECTS KIND OF FUTURE PROOF CALIFORNIA PIPELINE NETWORK OR SYSTEM OR EDUCATION STUDENTS AND OUR JOBS. OF THE FUTURE AND IT REALLY- SHOWS YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA'S ASPIRATION TO BE A HIGH ROAD STATE WHERE OUR STRONG COMMITMENT TO WORKING PEOPLE IS AS CRITICAL TO OUR IDENTITY AS OUR TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS AND OTHER THINGS THAT MAKE CALIFORNIA GREAT. AND THESE PRINCIPLES ARE REALLY INFUSED THROUGHOUT THE PROPOSAL AND I'LL STOP THERE TO SEE- IF THE IF OUR COLLEAGUES. THE DEPARTMENT FINANCING ANYTHING THAT THEY WANT AT. FIVE HUNDRED PUBLICLY APARTMENT- FINANCING HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD AFTER THAT SUMMARY ON THE CURRENT HEARING NEED CHAIR IN THE ASSEMBLY. THANK YOU WE WILL CONTINUE ON ON THE SALAMA WITH THE L. L. CHAZELLE LOW WITH THE L. A. L. MIND COMING THROUGH FIRE. WE CAN HEAR YOU FINE PLEASE CONTINUE THANK YOU. THANK YOU ON EARLIER TODAY OUR OFFICE RELEASED A- BRIEF HANDOUT SUMMARIZING THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISION WORKFORCE RELATED PROPOSALS NOT ONLY WITHIN THE LABOR AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AGENCY BUT ACROSS ALL OF STATE GOVERNMENT. ON OUT WE WERE ABLE TO IDENTIFY MORE THAN THIRTY FIVE NEW WORK WORK RELATED PROPOSALS IN THE BUDGET ACROSS THIRTEEN DIFFERENT ENTITIES. AND TOTAL WE SOME. NEW FUNDING FOR THESE PROPOSALS TO GET JUST ABOUT FIVE BILLION. DOLLARS FOR THE BUDGET YEAR- AND SORT OF HIGH CAR HI LEVEL COME ABOUT. THE WORK FORCE PROPOSALS REGARDING- AND BEFORE TURNING TO THE SO CALLED JOBS PACKAGE THAT SECRETARY SUIT JUST WALK YOUR- ARM SO SPEAKING BROADLY ABOUT PROPOSALS ON WE'VE GOT A FEW CERTAINLY HAVE MERIT- AND WORK LEGISLATORS CONSIDERATION. GENERALLY WE VIEW. ALSO IS THAT EXPAND UPON IT IS. STATE WORKFORCE PROGRAMS THAT HAVE SHOWN SUCCESS OUGHT TO BE THOSE. I WOULD MOST AMERICANS ARE MANY I HAVE SHORTCOMINGS AT THIS POINT AT LEAST- FOR INSTANCE ARE MADE APPROVALS ARE NEW AND THE RELATIVELY LARGE- ACTUALLY DAY RELATIVE. TO WHAT THE- MENTENG AGENCY HAS OFTEN AND PAST AND SO WE'RE NOT SURE IF EACH OF THESE ENTITIES WILL HAVE TO ADMINISTRATIVE CAPACITY TO MANAGE SUCH A NEW LARGE WORKLOAD- SIMILARLY MANY THE PROPOSAL'S LACK OF CLEARLY DEFINED ROLES. ARE UP FOR INDUSTRY OR OTHER PARTNERS AND THIS RELATES TO AT THIS POINT IN THE MAY REVISION CYCLE. IN ESSENCE A LACK OF SIGNIFICANT DETAIL FOR EACH OF THE PROPOSALS THAT'LL GET INTO MORE IN A SECOND ON IT FINALLY WORK THEIR OVERARCHING COMMENT IT'S NOT CLEAR WHAT THE- SORT OF. UP CLEAR OVERARCHING PLAN IS FOR THE GOVERNOR'S NAME REGION WORKFORCE PROPOSALS AS I MENTIONED THERE SPREAD ACROSS ACROSS DIFFERENT ENTITIES AND IN SOME CASES INTERACT WITH EXISTING PROGRAMS BOB MAYBE DUPLICATIVE OF EXISTING PROGRAMS ON IT SO MORE INFORMATION IS NEEDED FROM THE ADMINISTRATION AT THIS. POINT BEFORE MAKING AN ASSESSMENT. I WANT TO THE SPECIFIC PACKAGE IT'S A- STUDENTS WALKING AGAIN TOPICAL IS NEARLY ONE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS PRIMARILY AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN FUNDS THE LARGEST COMPONENT IS THE COMMUNITY ECONOMIC RESILIENCE BONTA SECRETARY SUIT MENTIONED- THIS WOULD BE SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR GRANTS. TO REGIONAL PARTNERSHIPS- OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS TO IMPLEMENT PROGRAMS. ON THAT ARE ALIGNED WITH THE STATE'S OP FORTHCOMING REPORT OF THE INVESTIGATION PLANS TO PUBLISH IN JULY- CALLED THAT JUST TRANSITION ROADMAP. FONG I DON'T THINK WE WOULD POINT OUT IS THAT BECAUSE THE ROADMAP ISN'T YET PUBLIC AND LEGISLATURE HASN'T HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW IT IN DETAIL OR PROVIDE COMMENTS OR FEEDBACK IT'S A BIT CHALLENGING AT THIS TIME. SENATE TO SORT OF REFLECT UPON THE RESILIENCY FUNDED AND IT'S PACKAGED- THROUGH THE LENS OF THE JUST TRANSITION ROAD MAP. BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T YET HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK THROUGH THAT- ADDITIONALLY IN THERE ARE EIGHT OTHER COMPONENTS OF THE JOBS PACKAGE- THEY'RE ALL INCLUDED IN ONE BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL THERE'S RELATIVELY LIMITED INFORMATION AT THIS TIME- BUT- IN LARGE PART A OUR- NEW PROPOSALS RATHER THAN EXPANSION OF EXISTING PROPOSALS- I WOULD MENTION THAT. THE WARRANTY EXPANSION OF AN EXISTING PROGRAM IS THE NINETY MILLION DOLLAR EXPANSION TO THE I ROADS TRAINING PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM IN THE COMMUNITY WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD THIS IS A PRIME EXAMPLE OF A PROPOSAL THAT IN OUR VIEW WARRANTS. CONSIDERATION HAS MERIT BECAUSE EXISTING PROGRAMS THAT ARE SORT. OF THE TOOK BREAD AND BUTTER WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. PROGRAM AT THE STATE'S OPERATED- IT HEARING ARE ALL IS REYES CONCERN AND- THE DEPARTMENT OF. AS WELL ABOUT STATE'S JUST FRAG WORK SYSTEM- AND WE WERE IT'S POINT GIVEN THE MULTI OF NEW PROPOSED. ARE THAT RELIGION COULD COME TO A FIVE. EVEN THOUGH MANY OF THE PEOPLE ARE JUST TO TOGETHER DIFFERENT ENTITY- AND ASK A LOT OF MOVING. ALL AT ONE TIME AND IT SHOULD BE TAKEN UNDER CAREFUL CONSIDERATION. ON MY FINAL REMARKS WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH- JANUARY PROPOSAL LOOKING BACK AT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED NEW DEPARTMENT OF BETTER JOBS AND HIGHER WAGES WHICH WOULD BE A DEPARTMENTAL REORGANIZATION. ARE CONSOLIDATING I PORTION OF THE E. D. WITH THE EMPLOYMENT TRAINING. PANEL OF THE COUPLE WORKFORCE AT ALL BOARD AS WELL ADDS- DIVISION OF APPRENTICESHIP STAY WITHIN TI ALL. YEAH THE TIME R. O. NOTE THAT WE REMAIN CONCERNED THAT PURSUING A DEPARTMENTAL REORGANIZATION THIS TIME GIVEN THAT CHALLENGES AT THE E. D. WHAT'S THE STATE'S UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE PROGRAM. I WAS WORRISOME AND- NOW WHAT ARE WE MUST AMPLE THOSE CONCERNS ARE BECAUSE OF THE MAGNITUDE OF THE PROPOSALS INCLUDED IN MAY REVISION AND THEY AT THE FORTHCOMING AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACTS FUNDS- WILL QUESTION WHETHER. SPECIFICALLY COMPLEMENT WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD WILL HAVE TO SPEND MINISTRY CAPACITY ALONGSIDE LABOR AGENCY TO IMPLEMENT THIS NEW YORK REORGANIZATION IT'S TIME- THANK YOU HAVE TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU FOR THAT WELL THIS IS DEFINITELY A LOT OF INFORMATION THEY WERE ALL KIND OF TRYING TO DIVE. DEEP INTO AYE I HAVE A LOT OF- I HAVE SOME FOLLOW UP BUT I ALSO WANT TO OPEN IT UP TO. TO MY COLLEAGUES AS WELL BUT LET ME BEGIN WITH SECRETARY SUE CAN YOU PLEASE ELABORATE AS MUCH AS YOU CAN UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS PROPOSAL HAS NOT. BEEN MADE AVAILABLE YET- THE JUST TRANSITION ROAD MAP WHAT EXACTLY DOES THAT LOOK LIKE. IT IS A CONVERSATION THAT WE ALL HAVE JUST TRANSITION ARE. ARE HOT WORDS THAT WE TALK A LOT ABOUT. BUT I AM ACTUALLY QUITE INTERESTED IN TERMS OF THE WHAT WE'VE DONE AND THE LEGISLATURE TO. ENSURE THAT WORKERS HAVE THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO RETAIN A GOOD JOB A GOOD UNION JOB A GOOD SALARY JOB- IN INDUSTRIES THAT ARE POTENTIALLY BEING- IMPACTED BY LEGISLATION AND CURIOUS AS TO WHAT THAT FUTURE LOOKS LIKE. THANK YOU SO MUCH MADAM CHAIR I AM ACTUALLY GOING TO TURN THIS OVER TO US SEVERAL WHITE- FROM OPR WHO IS HERE- WE HAVE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY ON IT BUT SHE HAS REALLY- BEEN DRIVING A LOT OF THAT I WOULD LOVE TO GIVE HER A CHANCE TO SHARE. THAT VISION SERRA. EXACTLY NEED- THANK YOU SO MUCH SECRETARY SUE FONG THANK YOU TO ALL THAT THE MEMBERS FOR- ENGAGING IN CONVERSATION WITH US ABOUT THIS INCREDIBLE INVESTMENT IN CALIFORNIA'S WORKERS AND COMMUNITIES. I THINK THE THING TO SAY ABOUT THE JUST TRANSITION ROAD MAP IS THAT. WE TRIED REALLY STEER AWAY FROM THE LANGUAGE OF JUST TRANSITION FOR ALL KINDS OF REASONS WE RECORDED WITH AS A I WROTE TRANSITION YOU'LL FIND THE NAMES. IN THIS OP PROPOSAL ALIGNED WITH THAT HARBOR COLLABORATIVES CENTER WERE HIGH ROAD IS A VISION OF SUSTAINABILITY EQUITY JOB QUALITY SHARED PROSPERITY ALL OF THE THINGS THE VALUES THAT THAT THIS LEGISLATURE HAS HELD UP IN IN TOTAL WANT TO SEE IT DIFFERENT WAYS SO IT IS A TRANSITION. IS NOT. ONLY A TRANSITION- IT TWO FAR A CARBON ECONOMY WHICH AFFECTS EVERYTHING SECTOR NOT JUST ENERGY TRANSPORTATION BUT ALSO SMALL JOBS AS WELL AS THE RECOVERED. FROM THE ECONOMY OF THE STATE IN MANY REGIONS AND MANY SECTORS BY THE PANDEMIC SO WE THINK ABOUT RECOVERY AND WE THINK ABOUT TRANSITION AND HOW DO WE DO THAT IN A WAY THAT LIFTS UP ALL CALIFORNIANS I THINK A SECRETARY SU SAID SO ELOQUENTLY. IT'S NOT AS IF THE ECONOMY BEFORE THE PANDEMIC WAS ANSWERING ALL OF OUR ECONOMIC INEQUALITY OUT QUESTIONS SO WHERE THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE HERE SO FOR US. WE'VE BEEN DISCOVERING IN OUR MANY CONVERSATIONS THIS YEAR IS THIS HIRING TRANSITION REALLY IS THIS THE LONG RANGE PLANNING GAME THERE ARE CERTAIN SHORT TERM THINGS THAT WE CAN ALL DO INCLUDING THE THINGS IN THIS PROPOSAL. BUT REALLY THERE ARE FIVE ELEMENTS SO I THINK WHAT WE THINK ABOUT IT LET ME JUST. DIRECTOR TENSIONS WORKFORCE IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS BUT WE SIMPLY CANNOT TRAIN OUR WAY OUT OF A JOB FIRST AS WE CANNOT TRAIN BEFORE JOBS THAT DON'T EXIST OR QUALITY JOBS YET THAT'S NOT AN EQUITY AGENDA SO MILLION THINKING ABOUT. FIVE ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION INDUSTRIAL PLANNING. WARNING THE SAFETY NET. BUILDING. THE WORK. OVER THE PAST YEAR- AND THEN DOING SUMMER WE LOVE SO THAT WE ACTUALLY DECIDE WITH THEIR OWN CANNOT. WILL LIKE THAT'S WHAT MY UP THE JEFF TRANSITION. SO WE ARE UP- SERIES OF- AREAS OF WAR. TO BE LOOKING AND MY THINK OF THAT IN THIS. THE BUT YOU CAN RESILIENCE FUNDS AT THE ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION. AND HE TURKEY. REALLY LIVE UP SORT OF THE COUNTRY'S CUTTING EDGE VISION OF HOW TO. ADEQUATELY PREPARE WAS FIRST- FOR A NEW ECONOMY AND THE LAST THING I'LL SAY IS THAT WE'RE REALLY THINKING ABOUT A LOT OF DIFFERENT CALIFORNIANS HERE NOT JUST FOLKS WHOSE JOBS HAVE BEEN OR MAY BE DISRUPTED. BUT FOLKS WHO HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED FROM OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL KINDS OF BUSINESS BUILDING AN ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR THAT SO JUST TRANSITION IS NORTHWEST CATEGORY. IN WHICH WE'RE LOOKING AT ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT SECTORS AND THIS. OP REPUBLICANS. SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSES TWO OF THEM. AND WHAT IS AND IF I MAY WHAT IS THE- EFFORT TO ENSURE THAT. HI ROAD OR JUST TRANSITION IS NOT JUST SOLELY FOR WORKERS THAT ARE- WHOSE INDUSTRIES MAY BE IMPACTED. BUT THAT WE ARE ALSO CREATING A PIPELINE OF NEW WORK FORCE. SOME CURIOUS AS TO WHAT THE DIRECTION IS GOING TO BE FOR OUR CAPE THROUGH FOURTEEN. EDUCATION SYSTEM TO ENSURE THAT AS YOU WORK ON A PLAN. WE ARE INCLUDING THE FUTURE WORKFORCE AND ENSURING THAT THEY ALSO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR A GOOD JOB A GOOD SALARY AND AN OPPORTUNITY TO SUCCEED IN CALIFORNIA. THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION I WILL I WILL ANSWER ONE PIECE OF IT AND TURN IT BACK TO. SECRETARY OF STATE. I THINK THAT. IF YOU LOOK AT THE PROPOSAL BUILDING JUST TRANSITION COLLABORATIVE ALLOWING REGIONS TO DECIDE WHAT THEIR ECONOMIES LOOK BY. THE WAY THAT WE GET. FROM THE EQUITY QUESTIONS AND BROAD QUESTIONS OF- OF. ECONOMIC AND WORKFORCE PIPELINES IS THAT IT IS SETTING THE STATE'S ROLE IS TO SET AN INCREASE OF TABLE THE STATE'S ROLE IS TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE- PUTTING SOME GUARD RAILS ON THE WORK WHENEVER WE INVEST MONEY DOESN'T. CHEAT BOT SUSTAINABILITY GOALS THE CHIEF EQUITY METRICS DOESN'T ACHIEVE JOB QUALITY METRICS. THAT REMAINS TO BE DETERMINED BUT I THINK THEY STILL HAVEN'T GONZALEZ SO THE TABLE AT WHICH LABOR COSTS TO BE PRESENT AT WHICH COMMUNITY GROUPS- ARE REALLY GROUND LEVEL ECONOMIC EQUITY GROUPS ARE INVOLVED IN THE VOICES OF WORKERS INVOICES A COMMUNITIES. AND RESIDENTS ARE ALL PARTICIPATING AS WELL AS- EDUCATION SYSTEMS AS WELL AS THE BUSINESSES AS WELL AS LABOR UNIONS AS WELL AS OTHER FORMS OF WORKER VOICE AS WELL AS THE WORKFORCE BOARDS- AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL SO IT'S A BIG TABLE THERE'S ROOM FOR EVERYONE TO HAVE THEIR VOICE IN THIS. AND THAT IS THE WAY THAT WE- DECIDED THAT- OR THAT WE ENSURE THAT THERE ARE NONE BOB BROUGHT ACCESS TO THESE JOBS AND I WILL ALSO SAY THAT THE HIGHER TRAINING PARTNERSHIPS. REALLY ENSURE THAT NOT ONLY INCOME BUT WORKERS BUT THAT THERE ARE COMPLAINTS IAN FOR PEOPLE THAT'S- COULD NOT HAVE ACCESS SCHOOLS GOOD JOBS YET SO IT IS IT IS. PART AND PARCEL OF THE HARDWOOD VISION. THAT- THAT THESE PIPELINES SPENDING ACCESS ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY. IS OPEN. TO ALL PROBLEMS. I'M SURE I'LL JUST ADD TO THE A LITTLE BIT RIGHT. YOU'RE THE QUESTIONS WE'VE BEEN LIKE YOU THESE ARE THAT THE THINGS THAT WERE TRYING TO ADDRESS AND- THERE'S THAT. YOU KNOW THE CALL THAT THERE STATE IT'S ALL LIKE THERE'S TOO MANY. OF IT TO WORK YEAH THAT REALLY THERE ARE STILL PIECES TO IT BECAUSE IT REALLY DOES. WE'RE REALLY LOOKING AT THE WHOLE OF THE SYSTEM AS A WHOLE TO SEE HOW IT ALL FITS TOGETHER INTO AGAIN THE KIND OF ECONOMY THAT WE WANT CALIFORNIA- HAVE- AND YOU KNOW. AGAIN HOW DO WE GET PAST THE WORDS THIS IS THIS IS THIS IS THE EFFORT RIGHT IT HAS TO BE. REGION'S WE YOU KNOW WE SAY BOTTOM UP PLANNING BECAUSE EVERY REGION HAS HAS DIFFERENT ASSET THERE ARE DIFFERENT CHALLENGES THEIR DIFFERENT STATES OF TRANSITION THERE ALSO IN DIFFERENT STATES IN TERMS OF. HOW FAR ALONG. THEY ARE IN A YOU HAVE YET TO HAVE ALREADY SET WHAT WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE CLEAR THAT WE WANT TO BE INCLUSIVE RIGHT WE WANT THERE TO BE. YOU DON'T THAT DON'T HAVE TO LEAVE IT THERE HAS TO BE MANAGED BUT THERE HAS TO BE UP COMMUNITY. AND AND BEYOND THAT BUT WE EXPECT THAT THE REGION'S ASKED YOU KNOW SO OFTEN THE CASE WHEN WE GIVE THAT SORT OF SET THE TABLE GIVE THEM OPPORTUNITY. THAT THAT THERE ARE- THAT THERE THAT THERE WILL BE IDEAS THAT DEVELOP THAT THEN WE WANT TO INVEST IN. AND WE NEED TO DO IT ALL UP QUICKLY WHICH IS WHY THESE ARE THESE ARE REALLY BIG INVESTMENTS- I ALSO JUST WANT TO ADDRESS YOU KNOW I THINK ON THE ON THE KEY TO FOURTEEN PIECE. SO YOU KNOW THERE WILL BE A PLANNING PROCESS BUT THE REASON I SAY THIS- FOR INTERLOCKING COMPONENTS BUT THE ONLY TO EXIST IS THAT THERE YOU KNOW THAT THIS THIS LAST PIECE ABOUT WHAT WHAT'S THE ROLE OF. ALL OF THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM RIGHT THERE THERE'S A HUNDRED FIFTY. FIVE HUNDRED ONE DOLLARS INVESTMENTS HERE IN COMMUNITY COLLEGES PARTNERING SO THAT THEIR ROLE IS CLEAR TO WRITE SO THAT SO THAT YOU KNOW WHEN WE HAVE. EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM CERTIFICATION PROGRAMS THAT THESE ARE ALL ALSO- PART OF ONE VISION SO THAT PEOPLE AREN'T GETTING YOU KNOW TRAINED ON THINGS FOR WHICH THERE ARE NO JOBS- AND YOU'LL BE BECAUSE- SYSTEMS TEND TO. REACT SLOWLY. WE NEED TO DO THE PLAY. HEADED TO. SO THAT STILL SO THAT WE DRIVING THE SAME TO. SO THAT'S WHY THERE'S SO MANY PIECES TO IT. AND WHAT WE SEE IN THE MICROCOSM OF THE H. R. T. P. H. I. C. C. WORLD IS THAT IS THAT IT DOESN'T WORK. YOU KNOW I JUST I SORT OF- CHALLENGE THAT THE NOTION THAT THERE'S NOT ENOUGH AND CARE ABOUT. YOU KNOW WHAT'S OF ALL INDUSTRY AND WHAT YOU KNOW WE DEFINED INDUSTRY AS BOTH. THE WORKERS AND THE EMPLOYERS WE'VE SEEN THEM COME TOGETHER AND H. R. T. P. H. I. C. C. CONTEXT. AND AND WE BELIEVE THAT THAT IS WHAT IS NEEDED. FOR THE FOR THE DEMAND SIDE FOR THE FOR THE PLAN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT SIDE NOT JUST THE TRAINING CENTER. THINGS TO THAT'S WHAT THIS FUND WOULD. WHAT WOULD WOULD DO TO HELP MAKE SURE THAT HAPPENS. THANK YOU I SECRETARY SUE. I WANT TO GO BACK A LITTLE BIT TO THE SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR FIGURE- THAT'S PART OF THE AMERICAN RESCUE PAN. PLAN AND I FEEL LIKE YOU MENTIONED A LITTLE BIT IN THE BEGINNING. BUT HOW WAS THAT FIGURED DECIDED. GO AHEAD SIR I'M SORRY I WAS. SORRY- STILL THERE I THINK THE DISCUSSION WAS NOT THERE IS A TREMENDOUS SENIOR ONCE IN A GENERATION MOMENT HERE- AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE SEEN IN CALIFORNIA AND OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRIES THAT OFTEN BECAUSE THERE'S MONEY FOR PLANNING VERY RARELY IS THERE FOLLOW UP INFORMATION TO REALLY BUILD ONE BILLS YEAH IDEA IS IF TO INVEST AND THIS WILL GIVE US. YOU KNOW WE CAN DO THE MATH OF A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS AND WE COULD SAY IT DEPENDING ON HOW THE RELATIVES SEVEN TEN MILLION DOLLAR PROJECTS BURKE SENSES READING AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO ACTUALLY CARVING IT UP THAT WAY BUT IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT IT'S ENOUGH MONEY TO ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT SOME OF THE CRITICAL EQUITABLE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS THAT ARE THAT ARE CRITICAL TO KEEPING CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY- GOING ON IN A WAY THAT IS ACCESSIBLE TO ALL FOLKS WHO IS REALLY ABOUT PARTLY HAVING A FARM FONG THAT HAD ENOUGH MONEY THAT WE DIDN'T REGION'S FIGHTING OVER ONE ANOTHER. FOR MONEY BUT THAT THERE WAS ENOUGH MONEY FOR EVERY REGION TO HAVE A HANDFUL OF PROJECTS WHICH THEY FELT WOULD BEST LIFT UP THEIR ECONOMY IN A WAY THAT WORKED- REQUIREMENT THAT WOULD THAT WORK IN THEIR WORKERS AND THAT WAY TO WORK WITH THEIR PROPERTY TAX BASE RIGHT THAT THAT THIS IS THE THIS IS THE IDEA BEHIND IT THAT THAT WERE COMMONPLACE WITH THAT WE'RE OPPORTUNITY COME AT THIS FROM A PLACE OF AMPLITUDE RIGHT. THAT WAS THE THINKING IN SUCH A BIG. PART THANK YOU FOR THAT I WANT TO PICK NOW AND SAY- I REALLY HOPE AS WE- OUT THIS HIGH. TRANSITION ROAD MAP THAT WE ARE ALL CONSIDERING THE COMPLICATIONS OF DIVERSE. AND EQUITY AND ENSURING THAT. REGIONS ACROSS THE STATE HAVE ACCESS TO. THE RESOURCES TO JOB TRAINING TO THE JOBS OF THE FUTURE TO ENSURING THAT. IT IT GOES IN A WAY THAT'S DIVERSIFIED ACROSS THE STATE AND THAT EQUITY IS AT THE FOREFRONT OF THE CONVERSATION WHICH I BELIEVE- WE IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE ALL ALL DISCUSSED- BE IT. I WANT TO PIVOT ON TO THE ISSUE OF. EDT I'M CURIOUS AS TO HOW THE- LANGUAGE ACCESSIBILITY COMPONENT IS GOING TO BE. ROLLED OUT CAN YOU PLEASE DETAIL WHAT IS PLANNED IN TERMS OF LANGUAGE ACCESS AND EXPANSION. SURE SURE LET ME ACTUALLY ASK FOR SIGNS TO DO. WE SUBJECT RESPONSE POSSIBLE SHE DIDN'T MAKE IT NASTY VARIOUS WITH EDT- THANK YOU VERY MUCH- YEAH NO PROBLEM OH OKAY SORRY THAT SHE'S GOING AND NANCY SORRY. I THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION SO- YOU KNOW WE HAVE- I'VE MENTIONED THIS IN SEVERAL FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO THE COMMITTEE- FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP- ON THIS ISSUE IT IS SOMETHING THAT- YOU KNOW EDT HAT AND YOU KNOW. IT HAS BEEN WORKING ON FOR A WHILE- AND YOU KNOW WITH THE HELP OF THAT COMMITTEE EMBERS- AS WELL AS THE STAKEHOLDERS- I THINK WE'RE IN A GOOD PLACE TO START- WHAT WE WANT TO DO AND YOU KNOW BASICALLY WHAT WE'D LIKE TO SEE IS YOU KNOW EVERYBODY WE HAVE THE GOAL OF EVERYONE OF SERVICING EVERYONE IN THEIR NATIVE LANGUAGE THAT IT THAT IS OUR GOAL- AND SO JUST JUST A FEW THINGS JUST TO TOUCH ON- WE'RE GOING TO CREATE. A LANGUAGE ACCESS PORTAL- SO IT'S EASIER FOR INDIVIDUALS TO NAVIGATE THE WEBSITE- IN ACCESS TRANSLATED FORMS IN THEIR NATIVE LANGUAGE- WE'RE GOING TO EXPAND THE TEAM TRANSIT ODD THE TELEPHONE INTERPRETIVE SERVICE SERVICES THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW- WE'RE LOOKING AT OVER. A. HUNDRED AND FIFTY DIFFERENT LANGUAGES. I AND OF- AS- THE SECRETARY MENTIONED WE ARE GOING TO- PROVIDE DIRECT GRANTS TO COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS- TO DO TARGETED OUTREACH AND EDUCATION WE DO SOME OF THAT INTERNALLY AT EDT BUT WE REALIZED. THAT YOU KNOW WE REALLY COULD USE THE- THE HELP OF THE STAKEHOLDERS THAT ACTUALLY DEAL WITH THIS DAY TODAY- WE ARE GOING TO BE HIRING A MULTI LINGUAL. ACCESS COORDINATOR- WITH DECISIONS UNDERNEATH THAT PERSON TO BASICALLY OVERSEE- ALL ALL OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW LANGUAGES- WE ARE WORKING ON- HIRING ADDITIONAL STAFF. TO PROCESS I'D NEW MULTI LINGUAL- PAPER FAX AND PHONE APPLICATIONS FOR THOSE THAT MAY NOT HAVE ACCESS.

THAT HELP CLAIMANTS NOW- AND- WE YOU KNOW RECENTLY WE DID HIRE A CLAIMANT STAKEHOLDER AS WELL IT'S NOT NECESSARILY PART OF THE B. C. P. BUT- HE DID- HIGHER CLAIM AND STAKEHOLDER THAT'S HELPING WITH A LOT OF THE- MARKETING SOME OF THE PROMOTION TO DO OUTREACH TO STAKEHOLDERS AND WOULD LIKE TO JUST BRING THAT ALL TOGETHER. THANK YOU I WANT TO OPEN IT UP TO MY COLLEAGUES ON THE DIETS MR CHU. THANK YOU I'M GONNA BE BRIEF BECAUSE I KNOW WE HAVE A LONG AGENDA TODAY BUT FIRST I JUST WANT TO THANK- THE AGENCY AND EDT FOR. THE INVESTMENT THAT THEY PROPOSED TO THE MAY REVISE- IN THE LAST COMMITTEE HEARINGS ON THIS. I THINK A NUMBER OF US FROM THIS COMMITTEE WE EXPRESSED. OUR HOPE THAT EDT WAS GOING TO HAVE MORE BUDGET PROPOSALS AND THE SPACE AND- REALLY WANT TO COMMEND- TDD DIRECTOR IN THE LABOR AGENCY FOR COMING BACK TO US. WITH WHAT I THINK ARE VERY MEANINGFUL INVESTMENTS TO ADDRESS OGOING ISSUES. BOB SPECIFICALLY AROUND LANGUAGE ACCESS AROUND IT MODERNIZATION AROUND DIRECT DEPOSIT. BOB YOU KNOW I KNOW THERE ARE STILL MANY DETAILS TO BE HAMMERED OUT BUT LOOK FORWARD TO THAT. CONVERSATION I WANT TO JUST ASK ONE QUESTION WHICH WAS RELATED TO THE ALLOCATION OF THE TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS. ONE TIME GENERAL FUND MONEY TO ADDRESS DEFERRED WORKLOAD AND ONGOING WORK NO WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT HOW WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT WE'RE AT THE END OF THE WE'RE SEEING THE LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL WHEN IT COMES TO THE PANDEMIC- BUT I THINK WE ALL KNOW. WITH REGARD ET DE THERE'S AN AWFUL LOT OF WORK BUT STILL HAS TO HAPPEN. MY UNDERSTANDING IS EDT ESTIMATES ARE THERE OVER ELEVEN MILLION WORK ITEMS THAT STILL NEED TO BE ADDRESSED THAT COULD TAKE UP TO THREE AND A HALF YEARS TO COMPLETE. BUT WITH THE RECENT BUDGET PROPOSAL- WE CAN HOPEFULLY BRING THAT WORKLOAD DOWN TO TWELVE MONTHS WANT TO JUST UNDERSTAND. HOW CERTAIN ARE YOU AROUND THAT TWELVE MONTH TIME PERIOD IS THERE ANY WAY FOR US TO ACCELERATE THAT- THAT DOES AS YOU CAN IMAGINE ON BEHALF FOR CONSTITUENTS FEELS LIKE AN AWFUL LONG TIME. TO WAIT. FOR THE END OF THIS TIME PERIOD. I THINK WE ALL REMEMBER AT ONE OF THESE PRIOR HEARINGS IN SEPTEMBER WE WERE TOLD THE BACKLOG WAS COULD BE CLOSED BY JANUARY OF THIS YEAR AND OBVIOUSLY THAT'S JUST CONTINUED. ON WANT TO JUST GET YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON ON ON THAT TIME FRAME AND WHETHER THERE'S ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO PULL THAT UP IT INCLUDING. MORE EXPENDITURE IN THIS AREA. I'M HAPPY TO DIRECT THAT TO THE DIRECTOR OR TWO MYSTERIOUS. WHOEVER WANTS ANSWERS. REDESIGNS YOU GATE. SO MANY CLARIFIED THAT THE ONE POINT SIX MILLION- BACK HAS BEEN COMPLETED. THAT'S NOT THE WORKLOAD THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS IF YOU RECALL IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HEIGHT O THE PANDEMIC WHILE WE WERE WORRIED ABOUT GETTING PEOPLE PAID. WE CHANGED OUR POLICIES AND HELD BACK SOME DETERMINATION PROCESSES. THAT IS THE WORKLOAD THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NOW. SO I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY THAT BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAD A LOT OF CONCERN ABOUT THAT ONE POINT SIX MILLION AND SO I WANT TO REASSURE YOU THAT JOB. IT THAT WAS HANDLED IN JANUARY SO COULD I JUST UNDERSTAND BECAUSE MY UNDERSTANDING IS THERE STILL A MILLION FOLKS WERE OUT THERE FOR HIM THERE IS NOT RESOLUTION OF WHERE THEIR THEIR THEIR THEIR CASES ARE- IF YOU COULD YES. AND THAT'S IT'S BEEN DIFFICULT FOR US TO UNDERSTAND WE WERE JUST GETTING A HAMMER WITH CALLS WE SEE ALL THESE NUMBERS AND WE UNDERSTAND NOT ONE POINT SIX MAYBE IT'S ONE POINT OH. WHAT WE TALKING ABOUT OR NOT YES THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION ASSEMBLY WHEN ARE WE- D. NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE THAT YOU SEE WHO ARE READING. OF THAT WE HAD YOUR FOR YOUR TAKE A LOOK AT OUR DASHBOARD WE HAVE A DIVIDED INTO TWO PARTS. WE HAVE A NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE WE ARE WAITING FOR THEM TO CONTACT US. TO CERTIFY. FOR THEIR BENEFITS YEAH IT'S BEEN A MYSTERY TO OUR AND WE HAVE. COMMUNICATED WITH THIS GROUP AT LEAST THREE TIMES BY. EMAIL BY TEXT ARE ENCOURAGING THEM TO CERTIFY. THAT'S THAT'S THE FIRST. THEN THERE'S A BUCKET OF BACKLOG OF OURS THERE HAS BEEN NO EXPERIENCED A SURGE IN PART DUE TO THE- IN END OF BENEFIT YEAR IT'S REALLY IT'S REALLY MAGNIFIED THE WORKLOAD AND I AND I KNOW THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BECAUSE THIS IS HAPPENING FOR LEGISLATIVE STAFF AS WELL- WE HAVE. A HUNDRED NINETY NINE THOUSAND- CASES THAT ARE TWENTY ONE DAYS LATE AT. WE'RE WORKING ON NOW THIS WORKABLE. IS NEITHER ONE OF THOSE ITEMS. THIS WORKLOAD THIS ARE DEFERRED WORKLOAD IS WHAT NEEDS TO BE DETERMINED THE DETERMINATIONS NEED TO BE COMPLETED. AND THE REASON THAT'S SO IMPORTANT IS THAT. THEY ONE OF OUR CONCERNS OVER PAYMENTS AND WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT WE GET TO PEOPLE IN TIME SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE A HUGE OVERPAYMENT PROBLEM SO THAT'S PART OF THE REASON THAT WE'RE GOING BACK TO THESE DETERMINATIONS SO THAT'S A SEPARATE ARE DEFERRED WORKLOAD. I HOPE I ANSWERED YOUR QUESTION. I THINK SO BUT YOU KNOW AGAIN WHAT I'M ASSUMING IS THAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE TWELVE MORE MONTHS BEFORE THESE ELEVEN MILLION WORK ITEMS THAT INVOLVE A LOT OF FOLKS GET RESOLVED AND THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO TO REALLY BRING THAT TIME FRAME UP. ARE AT THE VARIOUS WITH WINDY DAYS SO I MEAN I CAN SAY THAT THAT IS THAT IS THE CURRENT PROPOSAL- YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW- AND THAT'S YOU KNOW GIVING THE- GIVEN THE PROJECTIONS THAT WE DID THAT'S WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE I MEAN WE ALWAYS. YOU KNOW DEPENDING ON IF THEY CAN GET THROUGH SOMETHING FASTER THAN SOMETHING ELSE I MEAN THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT IT TAKES LESS TIME. WE'RE WE'RE CERTAINLY NOT OPPOSED TO THAT- BUT GIVEN THE UP THE NUMBER OF HOURS THAT THAT WERE POINTED OUT. YEAH THAT'S THAT'S WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW. OKAY I JUST WANTED TO ASK- YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY TWELVE MONTHS IS AN AWFUL LOT OF TIME RIGHT NOW FOR FOLKS ARE STRUGGLING SO. WANNA MAKE THAT POINT IF IT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO USE SOME PORTION OF THE- TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF BUDGET SURPLUS TO ADDRESS THAT AND BRING THAT DOWN WE ARE.

OF CLIENTS COMING YOUR WAY TO EDT HAVE YOU CONSIDERED MAYBE DOING SOME SOME VIDEOS IN ADVANCE POTENTIALLY ON YOUTUBE SO OR ON SOCIAL MEDIA THAT DESCRIBE. WHAT TO DO WHERE TO GO HOW TO ACCESS RESOURCES. SO THAT OUR OUR OFFICES ARE ALSO NOT INUNDATED WITH THE SAME QUESTIONS AND THE WEBSITE IS VERY HARD TO NAVIGATE.

THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE INCLUDED TEN BILLION FOR THE RE AUTHORIZATION OF THE STATE SMALL BUSINESS CREDIT INITIATIVE TO STRENGTHEN STATE PROGRAMS THAT SUPPORT FINANCING A SMALL BUSINESSES. CALIFORNIA IS ESTIMATED TO RECEIVE AT LEAST EIGHT HUNDRED AND NINETY FIVE MILLION IN THREE TRANCHES. THE U. S. TREASURY IS STILL DEVELOPING THEIR GUIDANCE FOR PROGRAMS AND ANTICIPATES ROLLING THEM OUT OVER THE NEXT TWO TO SIX MONTHS. GIVEN THE AVAILABILITY OF ADDITIONAL FEDERAL STATE SMALL BUSINESS CREDIT INITIATIVE FUNDING THE MAY REVISION REDUCES THE AMOUNT BUSINESS FROM THE FIFTY MILLION PROVIDING THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET TO TWENTY MILLION. THE MAY REVISION ALSO CONTINUES THE FOLLOWING PROPOSALS INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION ONE TIME TO CREATE A CALIFORNIA COMPETES GRANT PROGRAM FOR BUSINESSES THAT PROMISE TO MEET SPECIFIC CRITERIA.

AND THIRTY MILLION TO EXPAND THE FILM TAX CREDIT FOR PRODUCTIONS THAT WEEK LOCATE FROM OTHER JURISDICTIONS ADD THIS CONCLUDES MY PRESENTATION WE HAVE FINANCE STAFFING DEPARTMENT EXPERTS ON HAND TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU LET'S HEAR FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IF THERE'S ANY COMMENTS. NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS ABOUT THE L. A. U. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAD ALOE AGAIN FROM THE L. A. L. ALL SPEAK TO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED GOLDEN STATE STIMULUS PROPOSAL AND ENTERED MY COLLEAGUE BRIAN WHETHER FOR- TO DISCUSS THE BUSINESS SIDE- COMPONENTS OF THE PROPOSALS ON. THE GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED A SECOND BROADER ROUNDED GOLDEN STATE STIMULUS PAYMENTS TOTALING EIGHT POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS FOR FAMILIES WITHOUT A DOUBT THE GROSS INCOME UP TO SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS ON THE COST OF THAT SECOND ROUND IS. SLIGHTLY MORE THAN DOUBLE THE COST OF THE FIRST ROUND OF THE GOLDEN STATE STIMULUS PAYMENTS AND THIS IS BECAUSE THE BROADER SECOND ROUND WOULD PROVIDE PAYMENTS TO CALIFORNIANS WITH HIGHER EARNINGS SO THERE WILL BE MORE. BENEFITS- DISTRIBUTOR. I WE KNOW IT IN OUR- OF THE GOVERNOR'S FIRST PROPOSED ROUND. BONTA STATE'S. ESPECIALLY RELATIVE TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO PROVIDE PANDEMIC RELIEF IS LIMITED- AT THAT TIME AND WE CONTINUED TODAY TO RECOMMEND THAT THE OLD EPIDEMIC RELIEF OF THIS SORT BE TARGETED TO THOSE MOST IN NEED. AND IT FOCUSES ON THOSE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL AND A RELEASE- AND MOST NOTABLY THIS GROUP OF UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS WHO FILE TAXES USING AN ITEM. ON IN REVIEWING THE GOVERNOR SECOND ROUND GOLDEN STATE STIMULUS. BECAUSE ALL- WE FIND AT THE BACK MAJORITY OF THE PROPOSED PAYMENTS WILL GO TO HOUSEHOLDS WITH ALREADY RECEIVED. FEDERAL STIMULUS CHECKS- AS ONE EXAMPLE- COMPARING TWO OTHERWISE SIMILAR HOUSEHOLDS OF FORCE OF TWO WORKERS IN TWO CHILDREN- I GREW UP IN THE HOUSEHOLD THAT IT'S ELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL STIMULUS CHECKS WHAT ABOUT THIS TIME RECEIVED ABOUT TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN COMBINED FEDERAL BENEFITS UNDER THOSE THREE. SETS OF PETROL STIMULUS PAYMENTS WHEREAS A SIMILAR HOUSEHOLD BUT WITH UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS WHO ARE INELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL AID BUT ONLY HAVE RECEIVED ABOUT. TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS AT THIS POINT. I'M SO MY OF THIS INEQUITY- WE PERCENT ALTER. AND RECALL THAT WE JUST PUBLISHED THIS- BUT THE ONE. CONSIDER IF YOU WANT MORE. TARGET STATE STIMULUS ASSISTANCE UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS THAT THE FIRST EXAMPLE OR ALTERNATIVE THIS IS WHAT WE CALL THE EXPAND ALTERNATIVES- FOR INSTANCE THE LEGISLATURE ADDED. ON TOP OF THE EIGHT POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS PROPOSING OF A REVISION. TO PROVIDE. INCREASED BENEFITS TO UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS AS AN EXAMPLE HAVING TWO BILLION DOLLARS TO THE STIMULUS PROPOSAL WE ESTIMATE. THAT SALES PAYMENTS FOR FUND DOCUMENTED WORKERS COULD BE INCREASED FROM FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS EACH WHICH IS THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS EACH. OUR SECOND ALTERNATIVE OF IF WE PROPOSAL LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION WHAT WE CALL THE REDIRECT ALTERNATIVE- AND IN ESSENCE THIS WOULD WORK WITHIN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET AMOUNT OF EIGHT POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS. BUT INSTEAD LIMIT- STIMULUS CHECKS FOR THE SECOND ROUND TO HOUSEHOLDS WITH. ADJUSTED GROSS INCOME UP TO FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS RATHER THAN SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR EXAMPLE- RESPONSE COULD BE YEARS BY THE LEGISLATURE TO INCREASE PAYMENTS. MADE TO DOCUMENT IT HOUSEHOLDS BOB WE BELIEVE IN THIS EXAMPLE THAT PAYMENTS COULD BE INCREASED FROM FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS. TO ABOUT THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER UNIT HOUSEHOLDS- THAT THAT SCHOOLS THAT I PRESENTED ARE SIMPLY EXAMPLES OF THESE TWO OPTIONS THE LEGISLATURE HAS WHEN WORKING WITHIN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO. TARGET STATE AIDED TO FILL IN THE GAPS IN FEDERAL ASSISTANCE. TODAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISTRIAL MUCH APPOINT OF KERR FOR. WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY. UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS AND THE SPACE. I'M NOT REAL IS IT REALLY TO THIS REALLY TO I'D OR SEPARATE. THAT'S RIGHT I SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE CLEAR YOU'LL HAVE TO FORGIVE ME- ON THE FIRST ROUND OF GOLDEN STATE STIMULUS PAYMENTS INCLUDE PAYMENTS TO UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS WHO FILE TAXES USING HIGH TEN OF THE SECOND ROUND OF PROPOSED PAYMENTS WHICH WOULD FOLLOW THE SAME STRUCTURE AND THE FISCAL ESTIMATES THAT WE PRESENTED JUST NOW- ARE CONSISTENT WITH THAT SO. THE SMALLER SORT OF SUBSET OF THE STATE'S UNDOCUMENTED RESIDENTS WHO FILE THEIR TAXES USING. THANK YOU AND THE WANT TO MAKE A POINT OF CLARIFICATION THAT NOT ALL I TEN TAXPAYERS ARE UNDOCUMENTED WE HAVE TPS RECIPIENTS THAT ARE ALSO- I TEND TO TAXPAYERS SO JUST. JUST FOR CLARITY IN TERMS OF THE POPULATION THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE THERE ARE SEVERAL DOCUMENTED WORKERS AT. A FALL WITHIN DIFFERENCE BASIS OF WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE. YOU'RE RIGHT GENERAL TAKE THAT POINT OF CLARITY INTO. CONVERSATION THANK YOU SO WE ARE SPEAKING SPECIFICALLY ABOUT. IN YOUR IN YOUR ALTERNATIVE PROPOSAL ABOUT INCREASING THE FUNDING OR THE OPPORTUNITY AND RESOURCES FOR ITIN TAXPAYERS. PREVIOUS DURING THE BEGINNING OF CODED WHERE WE HAD THE ADDITIONAL PLAN GOING THROUGH THE COMMUNITY NONPROFIT GROUPS THAT WERE SERVING UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS WITHOUT WITHOUT ITEMS CORRECT. THAT'S RIGHT YEAH OKAY JUST I WHAT I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE CLEAR ON THAT. THANK YOU. FOR ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. I JUST HAVE A I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS I'M GONNA START WITH THE SMALL BUSINESS PROGRAM CAN WE GET SOME CLARIFICATION IN TERMS OF HOW MANY APPLICATIONS HAVE BEEN PLANTED YES SO SOARED INTO A MEDICARE I'D LIKE TO- PRESENT OUR COMMENTS ON THE SMALL BUSINESS GRANTS OLYMPIC ENERGY JOBS AND IF YOU DON'T MIND I'M SO SORRY MISTER WEATHERFORD PLEASE GO AHEAD. IT'S QUITE ALRIGHT THERE'S A LOT ON THE AGENDA TODAY- SO I'LL BE VERY BRIEF- THE GOVERNOR'S ON. X. THE PROPOSAL TO- PROPOSES. TO EXPAND THE- COVERED RELIEF GRANT FROM BY ONE POINT FIVE BILLION. DOLLARS WOULD PROVIDE SUFFICIENT FUNDING FOR MORE THAN- A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS I MEAN I'M SORRY- A HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND MORE GRANTS. AT THE SAME TIME THE PROGRAM TODAY HAS RECEIVED A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND MORE APPLICATIONS AND I WAS ABLE TO FIND. AND SO WE- WE ESTIMATE THAT ANOTHER EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WOULD BE NECESSARY TO FIND ALL OF THE GRANTS THAT HAVE BEEN REQUESTED SO FAR AND WE- UNDERSTAND THAT- THERE ARE VARIOUS OBJECTIVES FOR THESE GRANTS AND WE'D BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH IN YOUR STUFF TO THINK ABOUT VERY SALT. OF FUNDING ALTERNATIVES. REGARDING THE- THE JOBS INITIATIVES- THE GOVERNOR. PROPOSED SEVERAL NEW INITIATIVES TO EXPAND THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY PROPOSALS AND WE PROVIDED SOME COMMENTS IN JANUARY. THAT WE THINK STILL APPLY. AND I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT- ARE KEY RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THAT. THE FIRST IS WE RECOMMEND REJECTING THE PROPOSED INCREASE IN THE CAP ON THE KATE. EXCLUSIONS BECAUSE ROUGHLY TWO THIRDS OF THE COST. WILL BE BORNE BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. AND MOREOVER WE DO NOT TINK THIS PROPOSAL PROVIDES EFFECTIVE. OR TIMELY PANDEMIC RELEASE. WE SIMILARLY WRECKED REJECTING THE PROPOSED EXPANSIONS OF THE CALIFORNIA COMPETES. GRANT PROGRAM BECAUSE THE LEGISLATURE COULD PROVIDE MORE EFFECTIVE ECONOMIC RELIEF TO BUSINESSES IN OTHER WAYS. IN PARTICULAR WE PREVIOUSLY NOTED THAT EXPANDING THE MAINSTREAM HIRING CREDIT. WOULD BE WELL SUITED TO ASSISTING THOSE BUSINESSES THAT WERE HIT HARDEST BY THE PANDEMIC. WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE ONE TIME FUNDING TO THE CALIFORNIA HAS MERIT. SINCE THE TOURISM INDUSTRY CONTINUES TO BE DEPRESSED WE FURTHER RECOMMEND CONSIDERING A TEMPORARY REDUCTION IN THE TOURISM ASSESSMENT FEE TO PROVIDE RELIEF TO TOURISM BUSINESSES. AND LASTLY WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS WITH THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN GRANTS TO THE PORT AUTHORITIES. IF THE LEGISLATURE DOES WANT TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO THE PORTS WE RECOMMEND LINKING GRANTS TO COMMITMENTS TO ACHIEVE OTHER STATEWIDE POLICY OBJECTIVES SUCH AS IMPROVING AIR QUALITY. OR ADAPTING TO SEA LEVEL RISE NECKLACE OR COMMENTS ON THOSE ON PARTS OF THE PER THE PACKAGE. THANK YOU MUCH APPRECIATED LET SOME LET'S START WITH SOME SOME QUESTIONS AND- HOW MANY APPLICATIONS HAVE BEEN FUNDED WITH THERE ARE CURRENT ROUND OF FUNDING AND HOW MANY APPLICATIONS REMAIN ON THE WAIT LIST. IS THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING INTENDED TO FOCUS ON THOSE WHO ARE ON WAIT LISTS ON THE WAIT LIST OR NEW APPLICANTS. THIS IS RELATED TO THE SMALL BUSINESS PROGRAM. CAROLYN GRAY HERE HELLO SB A DIRECTOR. WE HAVE RECEIVED TO DATE FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE THOUSAND I FINISHED APPLICATIONS WHICH REPRESENTS JUST OVER SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN REQUEST. AND OF THOSE HOW MANY HAVE BEEN FUNDED. WE HAD THE EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND TWENTY ONE SUNDAY OR AWARDS MADE. EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND FUNDED OKAY AND- ALL OF THE COMPLETED SO YOU HAVE. FOR TWENTY NINE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY NINE THOUSAND COMPLETED APPLICATIONS EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND THAT HAVE BEEN FUNDED WHAT IS A PERCENTAGE OF THE OF THE DIFFERENCE THAT WILL BE MOVING FORWARD. ARE THEY ALL ON THE WAIT LIST OR IS THE PERCENTAGE OR IS A PORTION OF THAT LIKE SIMPLY NOT MOVING FORWARD. WELL THERE WILL BE A PERCENTAGE OF THE APPLICATIONS THAT FOR WHATEVER REASON DO NOT MOVE FORWARD TO SAY. VERIFICATION OR VALIDATION PROCESS SEES- WE HAVE CONTROLS IN PLACE FOR FRAUD WASTE AND ABUSE. ON THE INSTILL- POTENTIALLY THERE IS A PERCENTAGE OF APPLICATIONS THAT WILL NOT MOVE FORWARD FOR THAT REASON. OKAY SO IT'S THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR THE WAIT LIST OF THE DIFFERENCE OR FOR NEW APPLICANTS. OR A COMMON COLD WE INTEND TO ACHIEVE BOTH ON WHAT WE WOULD LIKE TO DO IS TO RUN- BROWN'S FOR. CLOSED BROWN'S FOR A WAIT LISTED ON APPLICATIONS AND- ROUND A FINAL ROUND THAT WOULD BE OPEN TO EVERYONE. SO WE HOPE TO ACHIEVE BOTH. AND WHAT ARE THE- THANK YOU AND WHAT ARE THE MEASUREMENTS OF SUCCESS TO DO THAT LIKE WHAT IS THE ANTICIPATION PLAN OR THE ANTICIPATED PLAN. TO BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THAT. WE FOR NEW APPLICATIONS- THAT HAVE NOT YET ACCESS THE PROGRAM. WE WOULD BE GOING BACK TO THE PARTNERS IN THE NETWORK AND RESUME THE WEBINARS. AND OUT REACH THAT WE- HAVE BEEN DOING. IT WITH A D. INCLUDE YOU KNOW ADDITIONAL INVITATIONS TO MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE LOCAL CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS. CBS CHAMBERS ON SMALL BUSINESS AND ETHNIC ORGANIZATIONS TO CONTINUE OUTREACH. I ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE HAVE PROPOSED ON THE FINAL ROUND TO BE AN OPENING ROUND. AS WE WOULD LIKE TO GET THE MAXIMUM AND THAT AMOUNT OF TIME POSSIBLE. TO CONDUCT OUTREACH. THANK YOU THAT WE EVEN HIT THOSE THAT DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE PROGRAM TO DATE. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THAT UP BECAUSE I ACTUALLY WANTED TO DISCUSS THE ADDITIONAL OUT REACH. OUT REACH PROVISIONS CAN YOU EXPLAIN OR GIVE ME THE PLAN IN WHICH YOU'RE OUT REACHING TO A DIVERSE POOL OF RESOURCES AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS AND SMALL CHAMBERS TO ENSURE THAT- SMALL BUSINESSES THAT MAY NOT BE TAPPED INTO EXISTING. PROGRAMS AND RESOURCES ALSO KNOW THAT THIS FUNDING IS AVAILABLE. YES- GO AHEAD DID YOU NOTICE OKAY I APOLOGIZE THAT IT BROKE UP JUST A LITTLE BIT YES TO DATE WE HAVE SEVENTY FOUR ON ETHNIC MEDIA PARTNERS ON THAT ARE ALREADY ENGAGED WE ARE PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ACROSS OUR NETWORK PARTNERS AND THIRTY DIFFERENT LANGUAGES ARE REPRESENTED ON AND IT DOES NETWORK PARTNERS AND STILL WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO AMPLIFY AND TO RELY ON OUR NETWORK PARTNERS TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THAT HELP REACH AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SUPPORT. AND WHAT ARE THE METRICS OF SUCCESS TO DO THAT THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OKAY I'M GONNA REACH OUT I'M GONNA DO OUR REACH WITH THE SEVENTY FOUR. COMMUNITY PARTNERS BUT THE RESULTS OF THE APPLICATIONS MAY NOT MAYOR THE SUCCESS RATE THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S DIVERSITY AND EQUITY IN THE SMALL BUSINESS PROPOSAL GRANT SO. WHAT DOES THAT ACTUALLY LOOK LIKE. I THINK THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO- PARTNER WITH MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE AND MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE REACHING INTO DISTRICTS AND AREAS. WHERE THE TARGET POPULATION THE IS. I THINK THAT- WE HAVE SEEN A CORRELATED IMPACT. FROM ROUNDS ONE INTO- VERSES THE LATER ROUNDS WERE WEEK INCREASED- THE ETHNIC MEDIA PARTICIPATION. INCREASED IN LANGUAGE SUPPORT WE SAW. A POOR LADY INCREASING THE NUMBER OF SUCCESSFUL APPLICATIONS AND AWARDS. SO I CAN GET IT WOULD BE REASONABLE. I'M TO BELIEVE THAT MOVING FORWARD IF WE WERE TO- CONTINUE. I'LL OR TO DOUBLE DOWN ON THE IN LANGUAGE AND RURAL AREAS SUPPORT THAT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO SEE. I'M THE SAMETYPE. OF IMPROVEMENT IN WARDS. THANK YOU I WOULD SAY TO YOUR COMMENT OF WORKING THE LEGISLATURE TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S PARTNERSHIP AND THE PREVIOUS- ISSUE AREA THAT WE COVERED IT WITH EDT. BECAUSE OF THE ISSUES WITH EDT AND ARE STAFFED ESPECIALLY OUR DISTRICTS STOPS BEING SEVERELY IMPACTED BY WORKING ON CASES WITH EDT. IT HAS NOT ALLOWED OUR LEGISLATIVE AND DISTRICT OFFICES TO BE ABLE TO DO THE WORK. THAT TRADITIONALLY WE WOULD HAVE DONE TO ENSURE THAT THEIR WE ARE WORKING WITH OUR CONSTITUENTS IN OUR COMMUNITY TO- PROGRAM EQUALLY WITH YOU TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE DOING THE OUR REACH NECESSARY SO I WOULD JUST. YOU KNOW IN FOR LACK OF BETTER WORD JUST PUSH BACK A LITTLE BECAUSE WE ARE ALSO AT CAPACITY AND SO WE ARE LOOKING WE ARE LOOKING TO YOU FOR SOME GUIDANCE IN TERMS OF HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT. YOU KNOW COMMUNITIES OF COLOR LOW INCOME MICRO BUSINESSES MICRO ENTERPRISES AT CETERA HAVE ACCESS TO THIS WEEK THESE RESOURCES AND- AND THAT THE FUNDING AVAILABLE TO AND THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO DO THAT OUTRAGE IS AT THE FRONT AND CENTER OF THE CONVERSATION. AND THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING THE MEASUREMENTS AND METRICS OF SUCCESS OF WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE KNOWING. THAT BECAUSE OF. ISSUES RELATED TO EDT IN THE OFFICE AND OUR OFFICE IS WORKING ON THOSE CASES. WE ARE ALSO NOT A CAPACITY TO BE ABLE TO ASSIST IN THE MANNER THAT WE WOULD TRADITIONALLY DO. YES I UNDERSTAND. AND THOSE ARE PRIORITY AREAS AS WELL. AND WE ARE DOING EVERYTHING WE THAT WE CAN TO REACH INTO THOSE AREAS- THE ONLY THING THAT I WOULD SAY. I'M REGARDING THAT IS THAT YOU ALL KNOW YOUR CONSTITUENCY BETTER THAN WE DO. AND SO WE- HAVE LOOKED TO ENGAGE AS MUCH AS WE CAN WITH MEMBERS SO THAT WE- TARGET THE AREAS THAT YOU ALL KNOW. ME TO BE TARGETED WITHIN YOUR DISTRICTS SO AND UNDERSTOOD WE ARE ALL TRACKS. THANKS THANK YOU YES WE ARE. I pGOOD AS WE POSSIBLY CAN TO ENSURE THAT OUR SMALL BUSINESSES HAVE RESOURCES.

I WANT TO PIVOT JUST A LITTLE BIT- IN THE SAME TOPIC RELATED TO ART MUSEUMS AND CULTURAL ARTS CENTERS THAT CATER TO ETHNIC COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AS WELL SPECIFICALLY THAT HAPPEN. HARDEST HIT- AND DUE TO THE PANDEMIC WHAT ARE THE LONG TERM EFFECTS OF HAVING THE CENTERS POTENTIALLY SHUT DOWN. AND WHAT'S YOUR FINANCIAL IMPACT TO FULLY RECOVER AT AND HOW CAN WE SUPPORT OUR CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS- BY FUNDING THEM- FUNDING THE CENTERS AT THIS TIME. I THINK THAT- AS- FIRST OF ALL OUR CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS ARE VERY SIGNIFICANT- COMMUNITY ASSETS- BUT- YOUR SPECIFIC QUESTIONS I. DON'T HAVE ANSWERS TO AT THE MOMENT BUT- MY OFFICE COULD CERTAINLY. WORK WITH YOU TO FOLLOW UP ON ON THE SPECIFICS THAT THAT. HAPPENED TO YOU I'M HAVE A CALL. TO ENJOY DOWN ON THAT OKAY. THANK YOU THAT WOULD BE GREAT AS WE KNOW THAT ARTS AND CULTURE PLAY A HUGE ROLE IN THE MORALE OF OUR COMMUNITIES AS WELL AS THE- YOU KNOW UNDERSTANDING. THAT YOU KNOW WHERE WE COME FROM WHERE WE'RE GOING IN OUR HISTORY ETCETERA AND- SCIENCE IS CLEARLY. AT THE AT THE HEAD OF THE CONVERSATION WHEN IT COMES TO THIS. MEXICAN MOMENT THAT WE'RE LIVING THROUGH IT SO THANK YOU I APPRECIATE. I WOULD APPRECIATE SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THAT. I WANT TO PIVOT A LITTLE BIT TOO- THE FILM TAX CREDIT. A THREE HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION AND THIRTY MILLION. IN ADDITION FOR A FUNDING TO. TO KEEP PROJECTS HERE- I'D LIKE TO UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT BETTER AS TO WHAT THE DIVERSITY EFFORTS ARE FOR THE FILM. TAX CREDIT AND WHAT ARE THE TRADE OFFS. CALLING BELL THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- OUR DIVERSITY TO CREATE. DIVERSITY REQUIREMENT CAREER READINESS INITIATIVE IN PILOT SKILLS TRAINING PROGRAM. ENCOURAGE AND CLINTON'S INCLUSIVENESS FOR PROVIDING. OPPORTUNITIES FOR INDIVIDUALS FROM DIVERSE BACKGROUNDS- WE JUST LAUNCHED THREE POINT OUT IN. JULY IN WITH THE PASSAGE OF THREE POINT OUT FUNDING WAS ESTABLISHED TO CONTRIBUTIONS. MADE BY THE APPROVED- PROJECTS THAT ARE IN OUR PROGRAM TO CREATE A PILOT SKILLS TRAINING PROGRAM. THAT TARGETS PEOPLE IN UNDER SERVED- AREAS AND UNDER REPRESENTED AREAS- SO THAT THEY CAN RECEIVE TRAINING AND ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY PRODUCTION WORK.

TO PROVIDE PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE FOR THEM SO WE HAVE A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT PROGRAMS IN PLACE. CAN YOU PROVIDE SOME STATISTICS IN TERMS OF WHAT THAT DIVERSITY AND EQUITY ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT IS THE PERCENTAGE OF. THE FILMMAKERS THAT ARE AFRICAN AMERICAN AND LATINO API WHAT IS THE BELOW THE LINE TRAINING LOOK LIKE AND WHAT IS THE WRITER'S ROOM LOOK LIKE I IMAGINED THAT. THESE ARE ALL PART OF THE CONVERSATIONS THAT YOU HAVE WHEN YOU APPROVE. OF THE PROJECT MOVING FORWARD OR AS THE INDUSTRY SAID WHEN YOU GREEN LIGHT A PROJECT. MOVING FORWARD. WHY WOULDN'T THE EXPANSION OF OPPORTUNITY IS FUNDAMENTAL I CAN GIVE YOU SOME STTISTICS ON- SINCE. TWO TWO THOUSAND NINE APPROVED PROJECTS IN PROGRAM TO POINT UP SUBMIT DIVERSITY INFORMATION FOR CAST AND CREW MEMBERS THAT ARE HIRED- THIS INFORMATION WAS VOLUNTARILY SUPPLIED- IT DOES NOT REPRESENT FULLY THE CASTING CREW HIRED BUT- OUT OF A HUNDRED FIFTY NINE PROJECTS. EXCLUDING BACKGROUND PERFORMERS- THERE WERE TWO HUNDRED SIXTY SIX THOUSAND. ROUGHLY PRODUCTION HIRES. AND OUT OF THOSE THERE WERE TWENTY TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIVE- LATINOS ON THE CREW AND THREE HUNDRED AND- THREE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY- LATINOS. AND NOW MOVING FORWARD AS I MENTIONED WITH THIS NEW ITERATION THE FAMILY TV TAX CREDIT PROGRAM WE WILL HAVE THE ABILITY TO TRACK DATA BECAUSE WE DO REQUIRE- IT IS A PROVISION OF THREE POINT OUT OF FOR THE PROJECTS TO SPEECH SUBMIT THIS IMPORTANT INFORMATION. WHAT ABOUT TALENT WHAT IS THE POOL OF TALENT LOOK LIKE. ONSCREEN THE POOL OF TALENT ON SCREEN I CAN GIVE YOU UP ENIK ANECDOTALLY I THINK. I'VE GROWN UP PERSONALLY- IN TERMS OF IN TERMS OF OUR OUR OUR PROJECTS- IT WAS HARD TO IT'S HARD TO- TO SAY EXACTLY REGARDING THOSE BUT THERE. AYE I DO BELIEVE THERE ISN'T AS MUCH REPRESENTATION- THAT THERE THAT THERE SHOULD BE. FRANKLY OKAY WELL THAT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT SO A LOT OF THE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE PROJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN GREEN LIGHTED. YOU HAVE STATUS FOR SOME OF THE- BELOW THE LINE WORKERS BUT IN TERMS OF REPRESENTATION AND TALENT. WE CAN QUICKLY LOOK IT UP AND SEE WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE. YES MADAM CHAIR I DID SAY CAST AND CREW I JUST CAN'T PULL OUT THE AMOUNT IN TERMS THE EXACT AMOUNT OF THE CAST AS RELATED TO THE CREW IN THOSE NUMBERS. WHY AND IF I MAY ASK WHY IS THE WHITE WHY IS IT A VOLUNTEER BASED IN TERMS OF THOSE STATISTICS. AND THAT WOULD BE AND ENGAGE IN TWO POINT OH THREE POINT OH IS DIFFERENT THIS IS THIS IS MANDATORY REPORTING SO THIS IS THE- FOR THREE POINT OUT AND I THINK I BELIEVE THAT WE WERE THE FIRST STATE ACTUALLY TO INTRODUCED THIS PROVISION AND AN AT BAT FROM A TV TAX CREDIT PROGRAM. ALTHOUGH NEW YORK ALSO HAS ONE NOW. WE HAD A VERY SUCCESSFUL HEARING WITH AN INITIATIVE THAT WE HAVE IN THE ASSEMBLY CALL THE- THING LETTING US INITIATIVE CHAIRED BY. ASSEMBLYWOMAN LORENA GONZALEZ IN WHICH ONE OF THE LAST HEARINGS THAT WE DID WAS SPECIFICALLY ON. ON HOLLYWOOD. AND THEN A SUBSIDY TO ENSURE THAT REPRESENTATION AND IN FILM. AND TV- IN MOVIES. IT LOOKS LIKE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND SO I'M- I'M ACTUALLY QUITE CURIOUS AS TO WHAT THREE POINT A LOOKS LIKE TO ENSURE THAT. WE MOVE IN THE DIRECTION THAT HAS EQUITY. WHEN IT COMES TO THESE FUNDS. WELL ALSO WITH IN TERMS OF. THEY ALSO HAVE TO REPORT PROJECTS REPORT THEIR VOLUNTARY. PROGRAMMING THAT THEY DO AND SOME EXAMPLES THAT WE HAVE OUR FRIENDS DID SO MANY SO MANY TELEVISION HAS A DIVERSE DIRECTORS PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDES ACCESS AND EXPOSURE TO QUALIFIED CANDIDATES FROM DIVERSE BACKGROUND EPISODIC. DIRECTING SO WE DO HAVE THEY THEY ARE DOING PROGRAMS OF THEIR OWN THROUGH THEIR OWN- D. III PROGRAMS AS WELL. AND IF I MAY I JUST WANT TO BRING IT BACK OUT HUESO THIRTY MILLION- AN ADDITIONAL DOLLARS ONLY FOR RELOCATION. BOB FOR RELOCATING SHOWS WEALTH THAT THE GOVERNOR SAID THAT IN TERMS OF LOWERING BACK A PRODUCTIONS THAT WOULD LIKE TO OR NOT. LAUREN BACK WITH LAUREN PRODUCTIONS IT WOULD LIKE TO COME FROM A JURISDICTIONS- HE HE STATED THAT PERHAPS FROM JURISDICTIONS WHOSE VALUES DON'T NECESSARILY ALIGN. WITH THEIRS AND SO THIS IS ME WE LIVE IN THAT THE STATE. OF CALIFORNIA I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE GREAT ASSETS THAT WE HAVE HERE IN TERMS OF PRODUCING HERE AND FOR KEEPING PRODUCTIONS HERE IN THE STATE BRINGING PRODUCTIONS HERE ARE YOU KNOW BE A VALUES THAT HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED SO MUCH YOU KNOW EVEN HERE AT THIS HEARING. AND I UNDERSTAND THAT I'M I'M JUST HOPING THAT THERE IS A CORRELATION BETWEEN. RELOCATION OF CERTAIN PRODUCTIONS AS WELL AS DIVERSITY AND EQUITY WITHIN THE WITHIN THAT RELOCATION. YEAH WELL YOU KNOW AND WE BATES SAID THE FILM TV TAX CREDIT PROGRAM IS A- PROVEN JOB CREATOR AND YOU KNOW SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC SPENDING- TAKES PLACE WHEN PRODUCTIONS PRODUCED HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THERE IS A GENERAL I CAN GIVE YOU OF I I'D SAY- EMPHASISED AND COMMITMENT TO DIVERSITY- IN THE PRODUCTION ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCTION- ENVIRONMENT AND SO IT THAT CONTINUES CONTINUES TO GROW AND AGAIN WE'LL HAVE AN IDEA AT THE END OF THE ROUTE OF THOSE RELOCATING SHOWS. OF YOU KNOW WHAT WERE THEIR HIRING PRACTICES- WENT WHEN THEY DECIDED TO COME AND SHOOT HERE AND SO THERE IS THAT KIND OF ADDED GOING TO BRING ENCOURAGEMENT I THINK THAT IS. THAT IT IS INCLUDED IN. THE AND THE THREE POINT OH PROVISION. THEY YOU AYE AYE MUCH APPRECIATE THAT DIRECTION. JUST KNOW THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL OF US THAT ARE LOOKING AT HOW THE FILM TAX CREDIT IS CREATING A- THE FUTURE OF CALIFORNIA IN TERMS OF HOW STORIES ARE TOLD IN HOTELS- STORIES AND- WHAT THOSE STORIES LOOK LIKE SO I LOOK FORWARD TO. WORKING WITH YOU MORE IN UNDERSTANDING. WHY THAT DIVERSITY AND EQUITY. IS IMPORTANT BUT ALSO ENSURING THAT THAT DATA IS ALSO BEING PROVIDED TO THANK YOU MUCH APPRECIATED. WE'RE GOING TO. THANK YOU. TO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS RELATED TO PORTS AND VISIT CALIFORNIA. RELATED TO PORTS WHAT ISSUES DOES THE ADMINISTRATION WANT TO ADDRESS WITH THE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN PROPOSAL FOR PORTS AND WHAT IS THE REGION'S THAT THE STATE IS TARGETING. HELLO MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS THIS IS MORAL FIRST SEE WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. AND JUST ONE SECOND. MY NOTES HERE RIGHT I'M SO THE NEED AT YOUR APPOINTMENT MILLION DOLLAR ALLOCATION WERE- OUR INTENT IS TO ADDRESS THE LOSS IS IDENTIFIED BY THE CALIFORNIA PORTS AND WE ARE LOOKING WILL ALL LOVE IN PUBLIC WORKS WOULD BE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE THE FUNDING. AND SPECIFICALLY THAT THE FUNDS WOULD BE USED FOR LOST WAGES AND CAPITAL INVESTMENT CONSISTENT WITH CLEAN AIR ACTION PLANS THAT ARE MANDATED BY THE GOVERNOR'S. ZERO MISSION EXECUTIVE ORDER. AND WHAT. SOME SORRY I MISSED THE PART WHAT REGION IS THE STATE ACTUALLY TARGETING. WHAT ARE THE REGIONS THAT ARE BEING TARGETED SHOW IT'S ALL ALL ELEVEN PORTS- ALL ELEVEN PORTS OKAY. AND THE BUDGET IS FOCUSING ON RE FILLING BUCKETS FOR EASY ADMINISTRATION OF PROGRAMS MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE ARE VERY LITTLE DETAILS ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE GROUNDS FOR THE PORTS. HAS THE ADMINISTRATION THOUGHT ABOUT SENDING THESE GRANTS THROUGH THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION THAT HAS AN EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE TO IMPLEMENT A GRANT PROGRAM. SURE THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- SO MADAM CHAIR THE- I THINK SO GO VISIT IS POSITIONED TO SUPPORT THIS GRANT PROGRAM PROGRAM IN THE SENSE THAT- BOTH THROUGH OUR INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS AND STREET UNIT- AS WELL AS OUR SUSTAINABLE FREIGHT AND GOODS MOVEMENT UNIT WE DO HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF INTERACTION WITH THE COURTS AND IN SUPPORTING. UP LOGISTICS AND TRADE AND- AND YOU KNOW THAT THAT IS ALL THE ACTIVITIES THAT ARE RELATED TO THE PORTS M. S. YOU KNOW HUGE ECONOMIC DRIVERS IN THE STATE SO I'M IN TERMS OF EXAMINING WHETHER THE STATE LANDS WITH ME. AN NTITY THAT COULD BE MORE EFFECTIVE I MEAN I THINK. WE'RE ONE ADMINISTRATION OR ONE TEAM I WOULD SAY I WOULD SAY THAT PERSON FOR MOST- I THINK THERE ARE OF COURSE QUITE EQUIPPED I'M AND I HAVE NO DISPUTE ON THAT BUT- I THINK THE FOR THE REASON I MENTION ABOUT GOKU'S SPECIFICALLY I BELIEVE THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING OF WHY- WE ARE POSITIONED TO ALSO SUPPORT THIS PROGRAM. DOES GO BILLS HAVE THE STAFF. TO IMPLEMENT THIS NEW GRANT. SHE SO. WE HAVE STAFF THAT ARE IN OUR INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS UNIT WE HAVE TRADE REPRESENTATIVES- ANALYSTS- AND STUFF AND WE ALSO HAVE STAFF WITHIN OUR GREAT AND SUSTAINABLE. SUSTAINABLE FREIGHT AND GOODS MOVEMENT MOVEMENT UNIT SO YOU KNOW BUT I THINK INTO THIS. I THINK. THE ANSWER YOUR QUESTION IS YES WE WILL FIND A WAY TO. LIFT IT UP- YOU KNOW THE U. S. A. ENDING A FEW PEOPLE MENTION THAT U. S. TREASURY GUIDELINES WERE JUST ISSUED. A LAST WEEK AND WE DOVE IN AS DEEPLY AS WE COULD TO THIS POINT WE THINK WELL WE HAVE A GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE EXPECTATION IS IN TERMS OF ELIGIBILITY AND- AN- ALLOWABLE USES THE FUNDING AND HOW THE STATE WOULD WANT TO STAY ON THIS PROGRAM UP- SO. YES WE WOULD WE WOULD. WE HAVE STAFF WHERE WE WOULD MAKE IT WORK. OKAY YOU SEEMS LIKE WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT IT A LITTLE BIT MORE TO ENSURE THAT YOU'RE SUCCESSFUL IN THAT EFFORT. AND THAT THERE IS ACTUAL STAFF READY TO TAKE THIS ON. WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO VISIT CALIFORNIA. WHAT SORT OF OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES HAS THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE INCLUDED IN THE PROPOSAL. I'M SORRY MADAM CHAIR CAN YOU REPEAT THE QUESTION I HAD A HARD TIME HEARING YOU. SURE I'LL ACTUALLY A LAST TWO QUESTIONS IN ONE WHAT SORT OF OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES HAS THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE INCLUDED IN THE PROPOSAL FOR VISIT CALIFORNIA AND WHAT SORT OF ANALYSIS WAS DONE TO GET TO THE NINETY FIVE MILLION. I YES IN TERMS OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVERSIGHT VISIT CALIFORNIA'S GOVERNED BY A THIRTY SEVEN MEMBER BOARD- THERE'S OVER TWENTY THOUSAND INVESTORS ARE SESSION BUSINESSES THAT NORMALLY FIND THE DAY TO DAY OPERATIONS- AS PART OF THAT FRAME GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK WE HAVE THREE TO FOUR HUNDRED MEMBERS OF THE INDUSTRY- THAT ARE LOOKING. AT OUR- PROGRAM OF WORK ON A DAILY BASIS AND THEN ON A FINANCIAL LEVEL WE ARE REQUIRED BY STATE LAW TO CONDUCT. AN ANNUAL AUDIT EVERY YEAR- AND I WILL SAY THAT WE'VE HAD OVER TWENTY TWO YEARS OF CLEAN UNQUALIFIED AUDITS WITH NO MANAGEMENT OPINIONS. AND THAT THOSE ARE VERY FOR ALL COMPREHENSIVE ON IT SO WE'RE CONSTANTLY LOOKING AT OUR PROGRAMS AND PROCESSES. IN TERMS OF THE- ANALYSIS FOR RETURN ON INVESTMENT AND IMPACTS. THE TRAVEL INDUSTRY PARTICULARLY DESTINATIONS SUCH AS CALIFORNIA FLORIDA LAS VEGAS NEW YORK CHICAGO WHATEVER DESTINATION. YOU KNOW THAT IS PROMINENT IN AMERICA. FOR THE MOST PART USES THE SAME DEPLOYMENT OF METHODOLOGY FOR ANALYSIS IN OUR CASE WE USE AN INDEPENDENT RESEARCH FIRM THAT LOOKS AT. A CONTROL GROUP AND LOOKING AFTER. ADAM WEIRDNESS AND INTENT TO TRAVEL THROUGH MULTIPLE WAYS. TO LOOK AT THAT INCREMENTAL SPENDING AND VISITATION AND FRANKLY TAX REVENUE AND JOBS THAT COME OUT OF. OUR ACTIVATIONS PARTICULARLY AS THEY RELATE TO MEDIA BUYING. AND A TOUCH POINT DIRECTLY WITH THE CONSUMER IT'S VERY EASY TO MEASURE ECONOMIC IMPACT. AND IT'S A NATIONAL STANDARD. AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THIS PROJECT WHAT IS THE TARGET AUDIENCE- AND WHAT IS THE MESSAGE FOR THE CALIFORNIA. UP FIRST AND FOREMOST OUR JOB IS TO SHORTEN THAT RECOVERY KIRK AND OUR LOWEST HANGING FRUIT ARE ACTUALLY CALIFORNIANS THEMSELVES. AS WELL AS A NATIONAL AUDIENCE SO THAT WOULD BE THE TARGET OF OUR MESSAGING AND WE ARE LOOKING AT THREE ISSUES AROUND. OUR STRATEGIES AND OBJECTIVES FIRST AND FOREMOST IS TO REALLY SUPPORT BRAND HEALTH BECAUSE WE GAVE NOT ONLY GONE THROUGH A BRAND TARNISHED SITUATION RELATED TO KOBE. BUT OF COURSE PRIOR PRIOR TO THAT WE HAVE IMPACTS ON THE BRAND AROUND WHILE BURKE RACES AND OTHER CRISIS AND WE KNOW WE WILL BE ANTICIPATING THAT COMING EVEN OUT OF THIS PANDEMIC. SECOND IS TO TRIGGER ACTIVE CONSIDERATION AMONGST THE TARGETED MARKET WHICH BY THE WAY IS TWENTY FIVE TO FIFTY FOUR IN TERMS OF THE MEDIA BUYING TARGET. AND THEN FINALLY DRIVE MARKET DEVELOPMENT- AND THAT'S REALLY TO GET TO THE TRANSACTIONAL LEVEL AND CREATE AN URGENT CALL TO ACTION THE KEY MESSAGE FOR US IS RECOVERY. AND THE FACT THAT PEOPLE HAVE MISSED OUT ON A YEAR OF MILESTONES IN THEIR LIFE WHETHER THAT'S WEDDINGS SPORTING EVENTS FAMILY GET TOGETHERS FRANKLY JUST LEISURE ACTIVITIES VACATIONS ARE THE DREAM OF A LIFETIME. FORTUNATE FOR US WERE ABLE TO MONETIZE THOSE IN SUBSTANTIAL TAX REVENUE BUT OUR JOB IS TO GET TO THE MESSAGE OF THE POWER OF POSSIBILITY. AND BEING ABLE TO MAKE UP TIME AND THE BILL YOU'RE DREAMING CALIFORNIA IT WHILE WE THINK OF CALIFORNIA AS A GOVERNMENT PROCESS LIKE THIS HEARING. CONSUMERS ACROSS THE NATION SEE IT JUST LIKE A RETAIL PRODUCT ARE THEY CHOOSING COCA COLA OR PEPSI ARE THEY CHOOSING FLORIDA ARE THEY CHOOSING CALIFORNIA AND OUR JOBS TO DRIVE THAT TOP OF MIND AWARENESS AND. GET THEM INTO THE CONSIDERATION SET. SO IT'S- IT SEEMS AS WE ARE GETTING INTO THE STAGE OF COMPLETE RE OPENING WITH FULL VACCINATION AND THE STATE IS DOING REALLY WELL COMPARATIVELY ACROSS THE STATE ASKING FOR NINETY FIVE MILLION WHEN FOLKS ARE ALREADY WILLING AND READY TO TRAVEL I'M JUST CURIOUS AS TO WHAT THE DIRECTION IS IN TERMS OF HOW THAT FUNDING IS GOING TO BE USED IN- EXACTLY YOU'RE TARGETING. AND IF WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF ALSO RECOVERING FROM COAL BED. WHILE OTHER STATES ARE NOT AT THAT LEVEL. I'M CONCERNED AS TO WHAT THAT. ATTENTION WE CAN LOOK LIKE FOR THE STATE. SO WE THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION IT'S EXCELLENT WEEK WE HAVE A SERIOUS ISSUE IN CALIFORNIA AS IT RELATES TO COMING OUT OF THIS PANDEMIC CALIFORNIA LOST MORE MARKET SHARE THAN ANY OTHER STATE IN THE CONTINENTAL US WE ACTUALLY LOST 26% OF OUR SHARE BECAUSE- WE TOOK A VERY CAUTIOUS APPROACH HERE IN CALIFORNIA DURING THE PANDEMIC. BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT SENT A SIGNAL TO THE NATION THAT WE WERE NOT OPEN FOR BUSINESS SO FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY WE ACTUALLY LAGGED BEHIND COMPETITIVE STATES IN TERMS OF THAT TOP OF MIND AWARENESS OR WHAT WE CALL DESTINATION READY NESS IN TERMS OF. ARE PEOPLE LOOKING THAT IS CALIFORNIA READY FOR THAT OPEN FOR BUSINESS MESSAGING AND THAT THAT TAKES AN EXTRAORDINARY EFFORT TO COME FROM BEHIND TO DO SO WHAT OTHER STATES ACTUALLY MADE UP SHARE DURING THE PANDEMIC SO AGAIN OUR TARGET IS RESTORING CONSUMER CONFIDENCE THE CALIFORNIA IS READY AND OPEN FOR BUSINESS AT THIS TIME WHEN THE COMPETITION IS ADDED TO YOUR SUS POINT. AND THAT'S WHAT THE MONEY WILL BE USED FOR AND CREATE A DIFFERENCE I WILL NOTE THAT THERE IS STILL INDUSTRY INVESTMENT AND THE ONLY WAY THAT WE CAN FULLY RECOVER IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A FULL THROTTLE APPROACH TO SHORTEN THAT RECOVERY KERR SO OUR GATEWAY CITIES SAN FRANCISCO LOS ANGELES ORANGE COUNTY SAN DIEGO SUFFERED THE MOST OUR URBAN CORES. SO PART OF OUR INVESTMENT IS TO DOUBLE DOWN ON AND URBAN LAYER TAKE AND RESTORE CONFIDENCE AND TOP OF MIND AWARENESS FOR THOSE URBAN CORES. THANK YOU AND I 1100% APPRECIATE THAT THE RESTORE CONFIDENCE CALIFORNIA HAS LED THE WAY IN TERMS OF COBIT RECOVERY. AN OPENING AND WE'RE GOING AND WHERE DO A LOT OF WORK TO ENSURE THAT ARE SMALL BUSINESSES HAVE THE FUNDING AND RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED AS MUCH AS WE ARE ALSO WORKING ON THE EQUITY ISSUE WITH VACCINE WHICH WE'RE SLOWLY. GETTING TO A GOOD PLACE ON AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT IN MY OWN PARTICULAR DISTRICT. OF MANY ESSENTIAL WORKERS AND MOST OF WHOM ARE LATINO SUFFERED THE MOST AND SO WHEN I WHEN I HEAR YOU SAY ABOUT. IN YOU KNOW OTHER STATES HAVE DONE BETTER DURING THE PANDEMIC I THINK OF FLORIDA I THINK OF WHAT WE SAW IN THE NEWS IN TERMS OF COLLEGE KIDS OR GENERAL POPULATION NOT WEARING MASKS NOT BELIEVING IN THE VACCINE. COMING TO CALIFORNIA AND ACTUALLY NEGATIVELY IMPACTING ALL OF THE GOOD WORK THAT WE HAVE DONE. SO I'M I'M JUST VERY PRECAUTIONS ABOUT WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE BECAUSE WE ARE NOT FULLY. IN A STATE OF- 1100% OR CLOSE TO. THE TOP OF A HERD IMMUNITY ACROSS THE NATION AND SO. I JUST I WANT US TO THINK ABOUT THAT BECAUSE THE HEALTH OF OUR STATE AND THE PEOPLE THAT LIVE HERE SHOULD BE. AT THE PRIORITY OF THE OF THE CONVERSATION. HI I AGREED MADAM CHAIR AND IF I CAN CLARIFY ARI A 100% SUPPORT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING AND PERHAPS. MISSED COMMUNICATED THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT CONSUMERS BELIEVE AND WHY I THINK WE DID IN TERMS OF THE RIGHT THING AND OUR UNIQUE APPROACH TO THIS. AS A MATTER OF FACT WE'VE NOW LAYERED IN AND PERHAPS YOU'VE SEEN IT AND SOME OF OUR IN STATE MEDIA THAT'S RUNNING. IS A RESPONSIBLE TRAVEL CODE. ASK DEAN AND BORING PEOPLE TO RECEIVE HER TRAVEL RESPONSIBLY WE HAVE AN ENTIRE RESPONSIBLE TRAVEL HUB ON OUR WEBSITE. THAT IS FRANKLY A BEST IN CLASS WITH THE NATION THAT OUR LOCAL DESTINATIONS ARE REPLICATING AND ACTUALLY HAVE SOME SYNERGY WITH SO. ARE YOU SUPPORT BACK CAUTIOUS APPROACH I IT IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENT ISSUE HOW DO THEN WE CLOSE THE GAP WITH THE CONSUMERS I DO NOT SUPPORT SOME OF THE RECKLESS BEHAVIOR THAT WE SAW ON FLORIDA I'M I'M I'M- THANKFUL APPRECIATIVE. OF OUR APPROACH AND NOW THE REALITY IS WHEN WE GET PAST YOU IN FIFTEENTH WE NEED TO START TO LOOK AT HOW WE MAKE OUT GROUND BECAUSE- WE ACTUALLY ARE LOOKING AT AT A TIME LINE FOR TOTAL RECOVERY. THAT TAKES US THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY FOUR AND WOULD COST THE STATE SEVENTY SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN CONSUMER SPENDING WHICH FRANKLY HURTS THE VERY COMMUNITIES. THAT YOU JUST SPOKE UP BECAUSE A LARGE PART OF OUR WORK FORCE. ARE LATINOS AND MINORITIES THAT ARE VERY MUCH PART OF THE HOSPITALITY FAMILY THAT WE WANT TO SEE HAVE THOSE OPPORTUNITIES GOING FORWARD. THANK YOU AND THERE'S A LOT THAT WE CAN SAY ABOUT HOSPITALITY AND WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE AN ENSURING THAT. WE HIRING EFFORTS OF THESE WORKERS IS ACTUALLY AGAIN- PART OF THE LARGER CONVERSATION. ABOUT RE OPENING AND RE OPENING SAFELY- TO A DISH QUESTION FOR YOU TO AND I WANT TO JUST KEEP IT GOING WELL WHAT WAS THE LAST GENERAL FUND INVESTMENT THAT WAS MADE NTO VISIT CALIFORNIA AND MOVING FORWARD WITH THIS PUT THIS THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL. HOLE WOULD BE. IN CHARGE FOR THE GOVERNMENTAL REPRESENTATIVES THAT WOULD BE- DIRECTING THE DISTRIBUTION OF THESE FUNDS. THE LAST TIME THAT VISIT CALIFORNIA HAD PUBLIC DOLLARS IN A SUBSTANTIAL WAY WAS ACTUALLY COMING OUT OF THE AFTERMATH OF NINE ELEVEN. THEN GOVERNOR DAVIS PUT TOGETHER A SPECIAL PROCREATION ARE SIMILAR TO THE PLAYBOOK AND TRYING TO GET TO THE SAME PLACE. IT PAID OFF VERY WELL ACTUALLY CALIFORNIA WAS ONE OF THREE STATES IN THE NATION TO GROW SHARE DURING THAT TIME. IN TERMS OF OVERSIGHT AGAIN PRINCIPALLY PER THE STATUTE- OUR BOARD WOULD BE SIGNING OFF ON THE FINAL PLAN OF WORK AFTER WE GO THROUGH ACTUALLY A STATEWIDE TASK FORCE RECOVERY TASK FORCE THAT CENTER MCGUIRE. AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER SHARON QUIRK. SILVA HAS ASKED FOR AND IN ADDITION TO THAT- WE HAVE TWELVE GUBERNATORIAL APPOINTEES THAT SIT ON OUR BOARD- AS WELL AS THE HEAD OF GOBIZ. DIDI MEYERS WHO SITS ON OUR EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE SO I THINK I BELIEVE THERE'S A LOT OF TOUCH POINTS AND SYNERGY- THROUGH LAYERED THROUGHOUT OUR PROGRAM. AND I'M SORRY IF I MISSED IT BUT DID YOU ACTUALLY GIVE GIVE ME THE NUMBER. WHAT WAS THE INVESTMENT MADE ORIGINALLY AND NINE AFTER NINE ELEVEN WITH GOVERNOR DAVIS. IT WAS APPROXIMATELY. EIGHT AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS. OKAY SO EIGHTY A HALF MEN TO NOW NINETY FIVE MILLION A A HUGE JUMP. YES THAT CAMPAIGN WAS REALLY A MORE SILOS- SPECIFIC CAMPAIGN DESIGNED TO REALLY CREATE CONSUMER CONFIDENCE WITH CALIFORNIANS- THAT WAS THE MAIN REASON BUT IT WAS ALSO LEVERAGED BY THE INDUSTRY AND MANY MEDIA PARTNERS SO IT ACTUALLY HAD A TOTAL LEVEL SPENDING OF ABOUT TWENTY FIVE MILLION. OKAY I WILL I WILL NOTE. I'M SURE ALSO THAT THE INDUSTRY CALIFORNIA IS THE ONLY STATE IN THE NATION THAT THE INDUSTRY BONDS THE TOURISM PROMOTIONAL EFFORTS- PRIOR TO KOBE IN THE INDUSTRY HAD INVESTED A HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS EACH YEAR TO SUPPORT THE GLOBAL BRAND HEALTH OF NOT ONLY THE HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY BUT THE BRAND STEWARDSHIP OF CALIFORNIA BECAUSE REALLY TRAVEL HOSPITALITY IS AN INVITATION AND A WELCOME IT'S BASICALLY THE CONCIERGE FOR BUSINESS. SO WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH OTHER ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ENTITIES AROUND MESSAGING AND POSITIONING ON BEHALF OF ALL CALIFORNIA BUT REALLY FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS WERE TALKING IN UPWARDS OF A BILLION PLUS DOLLARS THAT THE INDUSTRY PAID FOR NOT THE TAXPAYER DOLLARS AND CREATED THIS GLOBAL FOUNDATION AND FRAMEWORK SO SIMPLY THIS REPRESENTS A ONE TIME SPENDING LESS TO GET THAT. CAR IF YOU WILL RE FIELD- SO THAT THE INDUSTRY THEN CAN SHORTEN THE RECOVERY CURVE AND CONTINUE FUNDING FROM HERE ON OUT AS OPPOSED TO PUBLIC DOLLARS. THANK YOU IT MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR ANSWERS IN RESPONSE- I WANT TO GO BACK TO THE ATC PROGRAM JUST HAD ONE FINAL QUESTION IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH HOW MANY OR HOW MUCH OUTRAGE DOLLARS ARE AVAILABLE FOR OUT REACH FOR EITC. I'M SURE THIS CALL THE WHITE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND- I DON'T THINK MY- CALLING FROM FINANCES ON THE LINE THAT WOULD HAVE THAT INFORMATION SO I CAN GET THAT BACK GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT I'M NOT RICH. THREE ITC. THAT WOULD BE GREAT TO I WANT TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S A FUNDING AVAILABLE TO ENSURE THAT THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE HOPE TO BE ABLE TO ASSIST ACTUALLY KNOW.

IN DOLLARS CLAIMED- AND I BELIEVE ONE POINT ONE BILLION AND IN THE TO TWENTY TWENTY TAX YEARS WHAT WE'RE EXPECTING SO THERE FOUGHT TAXPAYERS ARE FILING RIGHT NOW AND CLAIMING CREDITS RELATED TO THE TWENTY TWENTY ATTACKS HERE THERE'S NO. THERE'S NO LIMIT IN THE SENSE THAT THAT THERE'S NO BUDGET LIMIT IN THE SENSE THAT IF IT ENDS UP BEING- ONE POINT YOU KNOW ENDS UP BEING A LARGE AMOUNT THE CREDITS ARE.

THAT WERE PROPOSED IN JANUARY WE THINK THAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD WAIT AND TELL THESE PROGRAMS ARE IMPLEMENTED I REQUEST INFORMATION FROM THE DEPARTMENT ABOUT THE STATE'S IDEAS OUR- SYSTEM STABILIZATION. AND MODERNIZATION NEEDS TO CONSIDER HOW BEST TO PRIORITIZE THE RELATED SPENDING. NATURAL SPEECH TO THE- PROPOSAL- WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT THE PROPOSED DEPARTMENT OF CANNABIS CONTROL ON THE MAY REVISION INCLUDES ONE HUNDRED MILLION AND ONE TIME GENERAL FUND SUPPORT FOR A NEW CANNABIS LOCAL JURISDICTION A SYSTEMS GRANT PROGRAM. THE GRANT PROGRAM WOULD PROVIDE FUNDS TO CITIES AND COUNTIES IN ORDER TO EXPEDITE THE TRANSITION OF CANNABIS LICENSEES FROM PROVISIONAL LICENSURE TO ANNUALIZED INJURE. THE PROPOSAL RAISES A NUMBER OF ISSUES THAT THE LEGISLATURE WILL WANT TO CONSIDER AS IT DELIBERATES- ABOUT ITS APPROVAL. FIRST ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT THE LEGISLATURE WILL NEED TO ANSWER IS WHETHER IT'S APPROPRIATE TO USE THE GENERAL FUND TO OFFSET LOCAL TOPS AT COSTS THAT ARE NORMALLY COVERED WITH LOCAL FEES AND OR LICENSEES PRIVATE FUNDS. IN ADDITION THE LEGISLATURE WILL NEED TO CONSIDER WHETHER IT'S APPROPRIATE TO SUBSIDIZE THE COST OF ANNUAL LICENSURE FOR ONLY A PORTION OF LICENSEES. AND WHETHER STRUCTURING THE PROGRAM AS A LOAN RATHER THAN A GRANT WOULD BE MORE APPROPRIATE. OUR NEXT ALL TURN TO THE PROPOSALS WITHIN THE CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL FIRST THE- PROPOSED CALIFORNIA CREATED CORPS PILOT PROGRAM. UP THIS IS THE PROGRAM THAT WOULD PROVIDE SIXTY MILLION ONE TIME IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. CREATE PUBLIC AWARENESS MESSAGES REGARDING THE PANDEMIC- THE ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL JUSTICE AND CIVIL ENGAGEMENT. THERE ARE SOME KEY QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS PROGRAM THAT REMAIN UNANSWERED FOR EXAMPLE IT'S UNCLEAR HOW EFFECTIVE. THE PROGRAM WOULD BE ADDED SHE BEING ITS INTENDED OUTCOMES TO THE EXTENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS INTERESTED IN APPROVING THIS PROPOSAL WE RECOMMEND THAT IT ONLY MAKES FUNDING AVAILABLE- CONTINGENT ON A PLAN BEING PROVIDED THAT WOULD DETAIL PRECISELY HOW THE GRANT WOULD BE ADMINISTERED. AND EVALUATED FOR COST EFFECTIVENESS. WITH RESPECT TO THE- ART COUNCIL'S CREATIVE YOUTH DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM- WE WOULD NOTE THAT MOST OF THE- PROGRAMS THAT ARE PROPOSED FOR FUNDING HAVEN'T BEEN EVALUATED TO DETERMINE WHETHER THEY'RE EFFECTIVE AT ACHIEVING THEIR RESPECTIVE GOALS. AS SUCH IT'S UNCLEAR IF PROVIDING THEM WITH ADDITIONAL FUNDING IS APPROPRIATE TO THE EXTENT THE BLOOD LOOK THAT THE LEGISLATURE MONSTER PROVIDEADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR ARTS PROGRAMS IT COULD CONSIDER WHETHER THESE PARTICULAR PROGRAMS ARE ALIGNED. WITH ITS INTERESTS WORK WOULD PREFER TO DIRECT. THE FUNDING TO OTHER PROGRAMS. NO WILL SPEAK TO THE- OUTPUT% FOR THE- VOLUNTEER- THE CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEERS IS STILL WORKING OUT SOME KEY DETAILS OF THE TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE MILLION CALIFORNIANS FOR ALL COLLEGE SERVICE PROGRAM. BUT APPEARS TO BE CLOSELY COORDINATING WITH THE STATE FARM COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY SYSTEMS WE KNOW THAT THE CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEERS WILL NEED TO WORK CLOSELY WITH OTHER STATE AGENCIES IN IMPLEMENTING THIS NEW PROGRAM IN ORDER TO AVOID. NEGATIVE INTERACTIONS WITH STUDENTS FINANCIAL AID PROGRAMS THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION PROPOSED FOR USE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT GRANT PROGRAM COULD PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO EXISTING PROGRAMS. WE RECOMMEND HOWEVER THAT YOU DIRECT CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEERS TO ONE OF ALL OF THEIR GRANTS ON A COMPETITIVE BASIS FINALLY WE RECOMMEND REJECTING THE THREE MILLION FOR THE START OF TEACHER RECRUITMENT- GRANTS BECAUSE IT'S DISCONNECTED FROM THE STATE'S BROADER. TEACHER RECRUITMENT ACTIVITIES. ALL RIGHT NOW I WILL TURN TO THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROPOSAL THAT WAS PREVENT PRESENTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRE. DEPARTMENTS RECEIVING DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FUNDING TO REPORT ON THE PROPOSED PROJECTS THEY WILL IMPLEMENT WELL DEFERRED MAINTENANCE IS GENERALLY INEFFECTIVE STRATEGY FOR MAINTAINING FACILITIES AND OPERATING MORE EXPENSIVE REPAIRS ON THE LONG TERM. IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE ADMINISTRATION TO IDENTIFY ITS PRIORITY MAINTENANCE PROJECTS TO ENSURE THEY ARE CONSISTENT WITH LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES. I NOW BE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH LET'S BEGIN I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS REMAIN RELATED TO THE CANNABIS. ON CANNABIS WHAT IS THE LONG TERM PLAN WITH PROVISIONAL LICENSES AND HOW WILL WE ENSURE A TRANSITION TOWARDS PERMANENT LICENSES. NOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS THIS IS RICHARD PARROTT AND WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FOOD NEVER CULTURE- I CAN GO AHEAD AND ANSWER THAT QUESTION- LOOKING A LONG TERM- IN ADDITION TO THIS- PROPOSED LOCAL JURISDICTIONS SYSTEMS PROGRAM- WE ALSO- IN THE TRAILER BILL. ARE PROPOSING TO EXTEND THE SUNSET DATE FOR PROVISIONAL LICENSES- AND ALSO ARE PROPOSING A DATE WHERE WE WOULD- DISCONTINUED THE ISSUANCE OF NEW PROVISIONAL LICENSES- AND THEN WORK WITH THOSE ALL OF THOSE EXISTING PROVISIONAL LICENSEES. AND MAKING PROGRESSION TOWARDS ANNUAL LICENSES SO WE ARE PROPOSING THAT IN THE TRAILER BILL AS WELL- SO THAT WE COULD- GET A SOLUTION AND NOT RUN INTO A SITUATION WHERE. I'M MORE UP AGAINST ANOTHER SUNSET DATE AND LOOKING AT PROVISIONAL- LICENSES EXPIRING AND HAVING TO THEREFORE POTENTIALLY DROP OUT OF THE LICENSED- SYSTEM. THANK YOU FOR THAT AND I ALSO WANT TO OPEN IT UP TO MY COLLEAGUE MISTER COOPER JUST A FOLLOW UP ON THE TERMS QUESTION. IT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR HOW LONG THE PROVISIONAL LICENSES FOR THREE YEARS OR- HOW MANY YEARS. THANK YOU MEMBER COOPER WE STARTED- WE BEGAN OUR PROGRAMS WITH TEMPORARY LICENSES AND- TEMPORARY LICENSURE SUNSET AT THE END OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN- THE CONCEPT OF PROVISIONAL LICENSES CAME FORWARD. MID TWENTY EIGHTEEN WHEN WE REALIZE THAT ONLY ABOUT 20% OF THE TEMPORARY LICENSEES WOULD BE ABLE TO QUALIFY FOR ANNUAL LICENSES- IT WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO. SEEK WHAT% AND OTHER LOCAL- MEETING OTHER LOCAL REQUIREMENTS SO THE CONCEPT OF PROVISIONAL LICENSES CAME INTO EXISTENCE- THAT AND SO IT HAS BEEN ABOUT- SO WE WERE ISSUING PROVISIONAL LICENSES AND ANNUAL LICENSES FOR THOSE WHO TO QUALIFY. WE'VE BEEN DOING THAT SINCE TWENTY NINE- SPRING OR SUMMER OF TWENTY NINETEEN. OKAY I WAS GLAD TO SEE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET- SIT WITH AN INCREASING EMPHASIS ON ENFORCEMENT RESOURCES. FOR CANNABIS THERE'S A MAY REVISE INCLUDING INCREASING LAW ENFORCEMENT RESOURCES. UNFORTUNATE RESOURCES. I'M A MEMBER COOPER CHEMICALS ON FROM THE BUREAU I'M SURE IT DOES NOT THE MAYBE BY JUST NOT INCLUDE INCREASED STAFFING- FOR PEACE OFFICERS SPECIFICALLY. SO ONE OF THE PROJECT WORK PROJECT WORK FOR THE SIXTY THREE SEWER PROJECTS TO RESTORE PEACE ALTERNATIONS OF PETITIONS. SO RIGHT NOW WE HAVE SEVENTY SIX ONE PEACE OFFICER POSITIONS IN TOTAL- AND SO THEY WILL CONTINUE TO WORK THE I'M LICENSE CASES ARE DOING RIGHT NOW. DO YOU HAVE SUFFICIENT PROPOSITIONS STATIONS. I'M GOING TO GET ARE YOU GOING TO GIVE HIM THE REQUEST. WELL I THINK WE DO IT THIS TIME- WE GET OUT AND FORCE MEANT FROM DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS OBVIOUSLY THE LAW ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES WITH THE SEARCH WARRANTS AND ACTIVITIES OF THAT NATURE BUT WE ALSO ARE WORKING VERY HARD AND PART OF THE WAIT REASON. WE'RE DOING THIS AS THE PROVISIONAL ARE TO TRY TO GET PEOPLE INTO THE LICENSE MARKET SO THAT WE CAN. HELP QUELL THE UNLICENSED MARKET THAT WAY THAT WE DON'T HAVE BY A LICENSED- PEOPLE TURNING TO THE ILLEGAL MARKET BECAUSE THEY CAN'T SUCCESSFULLY NAVIGATE THE LICENSING PROCESS. WE ALSO- HAVE BEEN DOING CONCERTED EFFORTS AND CONTINUE TO DO TO EDUCATE THE PUBLIC TO USE THEIR- THE Q. R. CODE AND OTHER RESOURCES TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE AND PURCHASING IT FROM LICENSED RETAILERS TO SUPPORT THE LICENSE MARKET. YOU KNOW TWO YEARS AGO WE HAD NO TWO YEARS AGO WITH THE BLACK MARKET THEY BEING SPECIFICALLY VAPING DESK. IN COVERT SUCKED ALL THE AIR OUT OF THE ROOM ON THAT THAT IS STILL AN ISSUE. WITH THE BILL DONE TO DEAL WITH THAT. I'M WE HAVE DONE THE- ONE OF THE THINGS WE DID WITH THE YOUR CO CAMPAIGN AND TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE KNEW THEY WERE PURCHASING FROM A LICENSED RETAILER MOST OF THE ISSUES CAME FROM. THE UNLICENSED MARKET- SO WE'VE CONTINUED TO DO THAT WE ALSO INVESTIGATED ANY LEADS WE HAVE RELATED TO THE VAPING CRISIS ADDITIONALLY WE ARE CONTINUING OUR RECRUITMENT EFFORTS TO FILL ARE VACANT- SWORN PEACE OFFICER POSITIONS. SO THAT WE CAN SEE WHERE WE'RE AT WITH THE RESOURCES THAT ARE CURRENTLY ALLOCATED. IF WE DETERMINE THAT THAT'S ENOUGH WE WILL COME BACK AND ASK FOR MORE IF WE IF WE DON'T THINK THAT SUFFICIENT ONCE REBEL TO DO THAT. I GUESS MY TO DRILL DOWN FURTHER THE- THEY HAD ONE- INVESTIGATION LA THEY GOT IT A PRETTY SIZEABLE- YEAH. I GUESS ENTITY THAT WAS DOING THE BLACK MARKET VAPING. AND THAT WAS IT SINCE THEN- THERE HAVEN'T BEEN ANY MORE LARGE SCALE OPERATIONS. IN THE BLACK MARKET CONTINUES TO THRIVE OUT THERE ESPECIALLY IN THE VAPING. PORTION SO- WHAT'S THE PLAN OF ATTACK BECAUSE IT HASN'T GONE AWAY- I SAID COVERT TOOK ALL THE AIR OUT OF THE ROOM SO THE FOCUS BEEN ON COVERT. WITH EVERYBODY ELSE BUT I HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING FROM THE- BUREAU ABOUT. BLALOCK IF THEY BEING. EIGHTY IS THERE A PLAN TO DEAL WITH IT. AND DEAL WITH THAT SURE WE'RE CONTINUING TO- WORK ARE UNLICENSED CASES- WE'VE DONE NOTHING DOING A NUMBER OF SEARCH WARRANTS- TO DEAL WITH THOSE. WE DON'T FOCUS JUST ON TAPING OBVIOUSLY IF SOMETHING COMES IN FROM BABY THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS. WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT AND WHEN WE DETERMINE WHAT. WE KEEPS WILL TAKE PRIORITY WE LOOK AT THE BIG PICTURE AS TO PUBLIC HARM- BUT WE ARE OUT THERE DOING SEARCH WARRANTS ON A REGULAR BASIS AND FOLLOWING UP ON LEADS DOING UNDERCOVER SURVEILLANCE AND THOSE SORTS OF ACTIVITIES. YOU SENATORS THAT'S OVER IBM'S TO SEE WHAT YOUR STATS ARE- FOR THE PAST MY GUESS FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS. YOU MEAN THE NUMBER OF SEARCH WARRANTS NUMBER SEARCH FOR SERVICE MEMBERS. INVESTIGATIONS ARE INVESTIGATION. WE KNOW THAT LIKE MARGOT IS MUCH LARGER THAN THE ARTICLE MARKET IN CALIFORNIA. SO I WANT TO SEE WHAT KIND OF ENFORCEMENT IS GOING ON. GOING ON ACTUALLY PUTTING AGENT AND ACTUALLY BRING IT TO ME BECAUSE WHEN YOU TELL ME THAT YOU STILL NEED A RESOURCE YOU. ASK FOR. FROM WHAT I'VE BEEN TO BY EVERYBODY. EARLY IN THE LONG FOR. LOS FOUR ZERO IS THAT STILL THERE ARE SOME REALLY. REALLY FOCUS MORE ON DOING LESS IS MORE ON THEIR LIFE. WITH THE LEGAL. ILLEGAL MARKET. SO WE CAN CERTAINLY GET YOU SOME UPDATED INFORMATION- FROM THE INFORMATION WE PROVIDED PREVIOUSLY ON THE SEARCH ONE OPERATIONS AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE- WE DO HAVE- ACTIVITIES GOING ON RELATED TO LICENSING AND LICENSING ENFORCEMENT OUR PEACE OFFICER UNIT IS PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON ALL THE M. LICENSE ACTIVITIES THEY CONTINUE TO DO THAT WE ARE OF COURSE ALSO CONTINUING TO FILL ANY VACANCIES WE HAVE AND FEEL THAT ONCE WE DO THAT WANT TO BE IN A BETTER POSITION TO ASSESS WHETHER OR NOT WE SHOULD REQUEST ADDITIONAL POSITIONS. MISTER COOPER BEFORE YOU CONTINUE LET ME JUST SUGGEST TO OUR PANELISTS TO GO ON MEAL WELL YOU SPEAK SO THAT THERE'S NO ECHO THANK YOU. HOW MANY VACANCIES DO YOU CURRENTLY HAVE. SO WE CURRENTLY HAVE FORTY ONE VACANCIES HOWEVER WE HAVE THIRTY EIGHT PEOPLE IN BACKGROUND RIGHT NOW FOR THE STATE. SO YOU HAVE THIRTY ONE VACANCIES OUT OF HOW MANY EUROPE WAS TO OFFER I STAFF SEVENTY SOMETHING OFFICERS. FIRST WE HAVE SEVENTY SIX TOTAL THIRTY FIVE ARE FILLED AND THIRTY EIGHT OF THOSE POSITIONS ARE ALL BUT THREE THAT REMAIN HAVE PEOPLE IN THE BACKGROUND PROCESS RIGHT NOW SO THAT'S GREAT IN THE BACKGROUND PROCESS BUT I MEAN YOU'RE BASICALLY RUNNING AT HALF STRENGTH IN HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN THAT WAY FOR. WHAT I WOULD HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK I WASN'T IN THIS POSITION TO BE SAFELY I'D HAVE TO. TAKE GO BACK HISTORICALLY LOOK AT SOME OF THOSE NUMBERS. THE PROBLEM WITH THE STATE IS NO MATTER WHERE YOU ARE- THAT'S LEVELS THE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES BECAUSE THE STATE THE PAY IS. IS NOT VERY GOOD AND IT'S ALL OVER DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU ARE WHETHER YOU'RE AT. A CANNABIS OR YOUR CONSUMER AFFAIRS OR REAL ESTATE- YOU THINK INVESTIGATORS INVESTIGATOR FOR THE STATE BUT THE STATE IS. SO DYSFUNCTIONAL WE HAVE DIFFERENT PAY SCALES ARE DIFFERENT BARRING AGREEMENTS SO MAKES IT HARD TO RECRUIT INDIVIDUALS WITH THIS. BECAUSE THE PAY IS LOCAL PROCEDURE OF MUSICALITY IS. THAT PAY MUCH BETTER SO IT'S ALWAYS BEEN AN ISSUE THINK ON THIS SUBCOMMITTEE. OVER THE YEARS WE'VE SEEN IT WITH DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS IN THE STATE SO. IT- ARE YOU DEBATE I'VE USED UNTIL. GOING BACK LOOKING BACK FOR THE PAST THREE OR FOUR YEARS. WHAT'S YOUR VACANCY RATE WAS. AND HOW LONG THESE POSITIONS HAVE BEEN VACANT FOR. I WOULD I WOULD LIKE TO THOSE NUMBERS ALSO. THAT WOULD BE VERY. SURE I CAN DO THAT THE PEACE OFFICERS WERE ONLY FORMALLY TRANSFERRED INTO THE BUREAU THIS FISCAL YEAR CORRECT BUT THERE WERE SOME RULES BEFORE THOUGH. YOU COMBINE THREE TO. NINE ONE. ONE THERE ARE STILL SO THERE ARE STILL SOME. CORRECT THEY WERE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS IN THERE AS PART OF THEIR STRUCTURE BEFORE AD THE SPECIFICALLY MADE TO MOVE TO THE BE HONEST SURE IT'S NOT BE HELPFUL SO. I'M THE VICTIMS WERE THERE BACK THEN. CHECK OUT APARTMENT OF FINANCE IF I MAY- I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY THAT- WE JUST READ OF THIS FISCAL YEAR WE JUST ADDED TWENTY NINE NEW OFFICER POSITIONS THAT WEREN'T PART OF YOU KNOW DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS. AND THESE TYPE OF PSITIONS FOR THE RECRUITMENT PROCESS IT TYPICALLY TENDS TO BE BLINKING AND YOU KNOW THE BEAR HAS BEEN WORKING HARD TO TRY TO FILL THESE POSITIONS SO- JUST WANTED TO POINT OUT THAT YOU KNOW WE JUST RECENTLY ADDED A BUNCH POSITION ITSELF AS THE POSITIONS WHICH IS PROBABLY CONTRIBUTING TO THE CURRENT VACANCY RATE IS THAT IN ADDITION. TO THE SEVENTY PLUS POSITIONS ARE ON TOP OF. ON TOP OF THAT. THAT'S INCLUDE THAT INCLUDED IT ESPECIALLY. OKAY SOMETIMES A THAT THEY HAD FEWER- TRYING TO YOUR PS OFFICER POSITIONS OKAY. LET'S SEE THE INFORMATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER COOPER SOME ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS ARE RELATED TO CANNABIS HOW IS THE ONE HUNDRED MILLIGRAM FIGURE GENERATED. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THIS IS RICHARD PRYOR WAS DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE- WE LOOKED AT- SEVERAL DIFFERENT- JURISDICTIONS ACROSS THE STATE A WE LOOKED AT WHERE WE HAVE THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF PROVISIONAL LICENSE HOLDERS- IN THE TOP EIGHT I JURISDICTIONS FOR CULTIVATION- RETAIL MANUFACTURING DISTRIBUTION. AND THEN WE TOOK A LOOK AT WITHIN THOSE JURISDICTIONS- GENERAL COSTS FOR- A PROVISIONAL LICENSE YOU TO BE ABLE TO QUALIFY FOR AN ANNUAL LICENSE I'M PRIMARILY LOOKING AT COSTS FOR SECRET DOCUMENTS FIRST THE SEQUEL PROCESS. AND BASED ON THAT- WE WERE ABLE TO COME UP WITH THE ALLOCATION OF- HOW FAST HOW THE I. ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS COULD BEST BE USED ACROSS THESE JURISDICTIONS I'M WE ALSO INCLUDED IN THAT FORMULA- I GUESS AT THE TOP EIGHT- STE COUNTIES OR CITIES WITH PROVISIONAL LICENSE HOLDERS. AND THEN WE ALSO LOOKED AT JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE SOCIAL EQUITY PROGRAMS AS WELL SO WE COULD FOCUS ON- SMALLER LEGACY GROWERS AS WELL AS- EQUITY- EQUITY OF BUSINESSES. THANK YOU FOR THAT THAT WAS ACTUALLY MY NEXT QUESTION IS HOW ARE WE ENSURING THAT THERE'S DIVERSITY AND EQUITY AND THE LICENSING PROCESS. YES SO- THAT I THINK THIS IS- THIS THIS A LAND THIS ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR GRANT PROGRAM LENDS TOWARD THAT END. CONSIDERING NOT ONLY- THE HIGHEST NUMBER PROVISIONAL LICENSEES BUT ALSO A LOOK LOOKING AT JURISDICTIONS THAT DO HAVE SOCIAL EQUITY PROGRAMS- TOWARD THOSE JURISDICTIONS WITH SOCIAL EQUITY PROGRAMS AS WELL- THEREBY- MAKING SURE. THAT I THINK WE'RE GETTING THE BEST USE OF THAT MONEY AND- THIS THIS- BOB POOL OF PROVISIONAL LICENSE HOLDERS I'M- TRYING TO CAPTURE SMALLER LEGACY FARMERS AS WELL AS SOCIAL EQUITY- BUSINESSES- IN IN ALL THOSE RESTRICTIONS I HAVE THOSE PROGRAMS. THANK YOU I THINK WOULD BE VERY INTERESTED IN KNOWING- THE AREA THAT I REPRESENT THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES HAS ALSO IMPLEMENTED A DIVERSITY AND EQUITY PROGRAM AND I'M CURIOUS AS TO WHAT THAT IS THAT COULD POTENTIALLY LOOK LIKE FOR THE ENTIRE STATE VERY SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS QUESTION THAT I ASKED REGARDING FILM TAX CREDITIN REGARDS TO EQUITY AND INCLUSION. SAME FOR CANNABIS LICENSING TO ENSURE THAT IT'S A REFLECTION OF THE STATE. YES YEAH AND I AND I THINK THAT THAT'S- YOU KNOW A VERY IMPORTANT. PART OF OUR PROGRAM I KNOW THAT THE BUREAU OF CANNABIS CONTROL. AS AN EQUITY- UNIT THAT WORKS VERY CLOSELY WITH THE JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE SOCIAL EQUITY PROGRAMS- WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT- ENHANCING THAT IN THIS NEW DEPARTMENT- I BELIEVE THAT- IT WAS MENTIONED AT THE BEGINNING FROM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THAT THERE'S ALSO- A PROPOSAL TO HAVE- DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF EQUITY. AND INCLUSION IN THE NEW DEPARTMENT AS WELL TO CONTINUE GROWING THAT PROGRAM AND ENSURING THAT WE ARE. WORKING WITH ALL THESE JURISDICTIONS. I'M TO HAVE THE MOST INCLUSION AND DIVERSITY IN OUR AND OUR POPULATION OF LICENSEES THAT WE CAN. THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE THE THOUGHTFULNESS BEHIND IT I YOU KNOW IN PREVIOUS HEARINGS WE HAVE ALSO DISCUSSED THAT THIS NEW OFFICE OF. EQUITY AND INCLUSION ENSURING THAT ONE INDIVIDUAL IS NOT SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THE EQUITY AND DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION EFFORTS THAT THE STATE HAS TO. WORK ON SINCE THAT SEEMS TO BE- AN UNREASONABLE. REQUEST FOR ONE INDIVIDUAL TO SOLELY DO THIS JOB FOR THEM FOR THESE VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS ACROSS THE STATE- ONE ONE FINAL ONE FINAL QUESTION BEFORE I HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE ARTS CAUGHT THE COUNCIL WELL THIS PROPOSAL TARGETS THE AREAS IN THE STATE WHERE THE MOST PROVISIONAL LICENSES ARE HELD IT WOULD MAKE FUNDS MORE DIFFICULT TO COME BY ELSEWHERE WHAT MEASURES ARE IN PLACE TO MAKE SURE WE DON'T SIMPLY MOVE THE PROVISIONAL LICENSING PROBLEM TO A NEW JURISDICTION. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR IN THE AND LOOKING AT THE JURISDICTIONS- WE DID. WE DID REALLY TRY AND FOCUS ON- FIRST SECTION OF THE SOCIAL EQUITY PROGRAMS AND THOSE WITH. REALLY THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF PROVISIONAL LICENSEES- LOOKING ACROSS THE OTHER- LOOKING ACROSS THE OTHER JURISDICTIONS WHERE THERE ARE PROVISIONAL LICENSES- WE STILL WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH- ALL OF THE JURISDICTIONS ACROSS THE STATE. EDUCATING THEM ON PATHWAYS FOR PROVISIONAL LICENSEES TO GET TO ANNUAL LICENSEES- IN IN LOOKING AT THIS FUNDING PROGRAM- YOU KNOW FOR THE OTHER JURISDICTIONS THAT WE STILL HAVE THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT FOR THOSE OTHER JURISDICTIONS- IF THEY NEED INFORMATION- TO BE ABLE TO EIGHT TO. GET THEIR THEIR LICENSEES INTO ANNUAL AN INTANGIBLE LICENSURE. THANK THANK YOU FOR THAT I'M GONNA MOVE ON TOWARDS A QUESTION FOR THE ARTS COUNCIL THE MAY REVISION PROPOSES SIXTY MILLION TO ESTABLISH THE CALIFORNIA CREATIVE CORPS PILOT PROGRAM IN ANOTHER FORTY MILLION TO FUND A YOUTH ARTS PER A YOUTH ART ARTS GRANTS WHAT METRICS WILL YOU BE USING TO DETERMINE THE SUCCESS OF THESE PROGRAMS. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. AND SHARE. AND BOND PROPERTIES IN THE CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL- THE METRIC THAT WE USE WILL USE- WILL BE FOR. IMPACT ON COMPANIES THROUGH THE CREATIVE CORE WILL BE DEVELOPED AS WE GO ALONG WE'RE WE'RE CURRENTLY DOING EIGHT- CAN ABOUT UA ATION OF ALL OUR GRANT PROJECTS. AND PROGRAMS AND THOSE TYPES OF METRICS WILL BE PART OF THAT AND BE ENCOURAGED FOR THAT NOW- IN TERMS OF THE METRICS THAT WILL USE FOR BETTER. WE HAVE USED DEVELOPMENT. THAT WILL USE SIMILAR METRICS THAT WE USED IN ORDER TO ALREADY EVALUATE AND ASSESS THEIR JUMPSTART'S PROGRAM WHICH IS ONE OF OUR CREATIVE YOUTH DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS WHERE WE DID AN INTENSIVE. EVALUATION AND ASSESSMENT REPORT ON THAT NOW FROM. THE METRICS INVOLVED YEAH ASSEMBLY INVOLVES SOCIAL EMOTIONAL LEARNING HOW TO HOW TO THE- KIDS OUR- KEEP COMING TO SCHOOL WHAT'S A RETENTION HOW HOW DID THEY BECOME EMPATHETIC HOW THEY WORK WELL AS LEADERS AS TEAM MEMBERS AND THEN HOW DO THEY GO FROM GRADE SCHOOL TO HIGH SCHOOL ON TO COLLEGE AND CAREERS. NO I UNDERSTAND THAT I JUST I'M CURIOUS AS TO I'M CURIOUS AS TO THE MEASUREMENTS OF SUCCESS THE METRICS AND WHICH YOU WILL DETERMINE WHETHER THE ONE. THERE'S DIVERSITY THERE'S EQUITY THERE'S OUT REACH THAT THIS POTENTIAL NEW PROGRAM THE CALIFORNIA CREATIVE COURT COURTS PILOT PROGRAM. IS A REFLECTION OF THE POPULATION OF THE STATE. THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND THAT SITS AT THE HEART OF THE PROJECT IT'S A REGIONALLY BASED PRODUCT PROJECT WE NEED TO COVER. ALL THE COUNTIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND HAVE REGIONAL FOCUS IN EACH CHARACTER THANK. THAT WAY WE MAKE SURE THAT WERE BURNED REACHING. EVERYBODY INAPPROPRIATE MATTER AND ARE USING TRUSTED MESSENGERS FROM THE PARTICULAR REGIONS THAT THEY'LL THAT ARTISTS WILL BE HIRED FROM. WELL WE HAVE A STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK FOR RACIAL EQUITY AND IN COLLUSION SITS AT THE CENTER OF IT AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO USE THAT FRAMEWORK IN ORDER TO MAKE THIS SOME PROJECT EFFECTIVE. IN ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. HOW YOU DETERMINE THOSE TRUSTED MESSENGERS WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE. SO WE HAVE A PRETTY CLEAR PLAN IN A PASS FORWARD FOR PUTTING THIS TOGETHER WE PLAN OFTEN OF MENDING OUR FIFTY FOUR COUNTY DESIGNATED ARTS COUNCILS WHICH WE CALL STATE LOCAL PARTNERSHIPS WITH GRANT CONTRACTS. IT'S JUST SO TAKE THEIR RE GRANTING CAPACITY TO LOCAL UNEMPLOYED AND UNDER EMPLOYED ARTISTS STATEWIDE. FIRST OF THE HE'S ALSO BE CONTRACTS SEVERAL PARTNERS WILL BE IDENTIFIED TO SERVICE REGIONAL LIAISONS. TO SUPPORT THE CREATIVE CORE PROGRAM IN THOSE REGIONAL LIAISONS WILL HELP HELP LOOK AT EACH AREA OF THE STATE AND MAKE SURE THAT IT IS TRULY APPROPRIATE AND REPRESENTING THAT PARTICULAR REGION IN ADDITION CA CO CONTRACTS SEVERAL ADMINISTERING NONPROFIT ARTS ORGANIZATIONS. THAT HAVE A CAPACITY FOR RAPID PAYMENT TO THE ARTISTS TO CREATE PUBLIC AWARENESS AND ENSURE OUT REACH TO ALL OF THOSE AREAS. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THE RESPONSE BUT I GUESS WHAT I'M NOT HEARING IS ACTUALLY YOUR YOUR PLAN WHAT IS- HOW YOU DETERMINED. THE REGIONAL TRUSTED MESSENGERS AN ADDITIONAL TO THE REGIONAL. POTENTIAL NONPROFITS THAT CAN SUPPORT THIS PLAN. SO WE ALREADY HAVE A STATE LOCAL PARTNERSHIP NETWORK IN PLACE. OKAY THEY ARE- IN THEIR DESIGNATED BY THEIR COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND THEY ARE PARTNERS THAT WE HAVE LONG STANDING THROUGHOUT THE STATE. IT IS HIGHLY LIKELY THAT MANY OF THOSE PARTNERS WILL ALSO BECOME THEIR REGIONAL LEADS. WE'RE WORKING ON A MORE DETAILED PLAN NOW AND WE CAN GET THAT TO YOU AND NOW FOR THE FUTURE WEREN'T ENCOURAGING EXCITED BY THE REACTION FIRST A LOCAL PARTNERS TO BE IN THE MIDST OF THIS WORK. AND DETERMINING ON IF IT THE- RESPONSE IS APPROPRIATE FOR THE REGION WILL BE PART OF THE GRANT GUIDELINES HOW THEY'LL DO THAT HOW IT MAPS WELL WITH OUR STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK. SO IF I WERE TO JUST AN EXAMPLE- YEAH IF I WERE TO. CALL LOS ANGELES COUNTY SUPERVISOR AND ASK FOR WHO IS ON CALL IN L. A. COUNTY-HAS BEEN TAPPED TO BE A TRUSTED COMMUNITY NONPROFIT RELATED TO THE ARTS THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO PROVIDE ME A LIST THAT HAS A DIVERSE GROUP OF POTENTIAL NONPROFITS. YES THEY WERE ACTUALLY THEY WOULD BE RESEARCH FOR FIRST TWO CHRISTENSEN KATAKU C. X. EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THAT L. A. COUNTY ARTS CULTURE. DEPARTMENT WHO IS ALSO OUR STATE LOCAL PARTNER IN THAT AREA. AND THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO THEY DO RE GRANTING THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO PROVIDE A LIST OF THEIR CURRENT GRANTEES. AND SOMEONE. AND OTHER STATE LOCAL PARTNER THEY THEY WILL GO THROUGH A VERY. BAD AND- PROCEDURE TO READ GRANT AND SO THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO LOOK IN THEIR AREA AND LOOK IN THE COUNTY. TO ASSESS. WHO CAN COME ON BOARD IF THEY DON'T ALREADY HAVE. OKAY I BELIEVE THAT I IF MEMORY SERVES ME CORRECTLY I HAD ASKED FOR A PLAN IN THE LAST HEARING THAT WE HAD AND MAYBE TO PREVIOUS HEARINGS AGO. AND IT SEEMS LIKE A BASED ON WHAT I JUST HEARD YOU SAY THAT YOU'RE STILL WORKING ON THAT PLAN IS THAT ACCURATE. WORKING ON THE DETAILS BUT WE HAVE A VERY CLEAR PATH USING OUR STATE LOCAL PARTNERS IN OF BANNING THEIR CURRENT GRANTS. AND UPLIFTING THEM WITH RESOURCE. TO BEAT THE NETWORK THAT WILL. DO THIS PROGRAM. GOT IT OKAY THANK YOU. I WE ARE DONE WITH THIS ISSUE THANK YOU AGAIN TO ALL THE PANELISTS THAT HAVE PARTICIPATED AND WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TOWARDS PUBLIC COMMENT.
