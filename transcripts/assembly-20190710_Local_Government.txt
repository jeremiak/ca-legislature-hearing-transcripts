LOCAL GOVERNMENT COMMITTEE IN ROOM FOUR FOUR FOUR SERGEANTS PLEASE CALL THE ABSENT MEMBERS. FOR MORE WAIT BRIEFLY TO HAVE THEM. ARRIVE THAT'S FOR YOU [inaudible] YEAH. IF YOU DON'T LOSE. YOUR LIFE TO SURVIVE. OKAY. WELCOME TO THE LAST LOCAL GOVERNMENT HEARING. ON SENATE BILLS JUST A FEW HOUSEKEEPING ITEMS TO GO OVER BEFORE WE START. THE SPEAKER HAS APPOINTED ASSEMBLY MEMBER LORENA GONZALEZ TO REPLACE ASSEMBLY MEMBER THREE OF US FOR TODAY'S HEARING. WE HAVE TEN ITEMS ON THE AGENDA TODAY WE HAVE ONE ITEM PROPOSED FOR CONSENT WHICH IS ITEM NUMBER TEN SB. SEVEN EIGHTY THE COMMITTEE ON GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE. IN THE INTEREST OF TIME ON THIS LINK THE LINK THE AGENDA WE ASKED FOR TWO MAIN WITNESSES IN SUPPORT AND TWO MEN WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. FOR EACH BILL. FOR ANY WITNESSES BEYOND THAT PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME YOUR ORGANIZATION AND POSITION ON THE BILL THAT'S IT -- WILL ENTERTAIN A MOTION ONE THING THAT WE GET A QUORUM AND WE'LL GO AHEAD AND START AS A SUB COMMITTEE. WE'LL BEGIN TODAY WITH OUR FIRST BILL WE HAVE SIGNED IN ORDER WILL BEGIN WITH THE FIRST BILL TODAY. IS ITEM NUMBER SIX SB THREE THREE ZERO SENATOR SKINNER WELCOME JUST BROKE MY KNEE IN THE PIT. THAT THE YOUR FUNNY BONE IT'S OKAY. WRECKED MY BEAUTIFUL OPENING TO THANK [inaudible] MADAM CHAIR. AND MEMBERS BUT WE WILL COMPOSE OURSELVES IN BEGIN. THANK YOU. FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT. SB. THREE THIRTY AND I THINK WE ALL AGREE THAT HOUSING IS A HUMAN RIGHT AND UNFORTUNATELY. IN CALIFORNIA IT'S INCREASINGLY A RIGHT THAT. MANY MANY PEOPLE CAN'T AFFORD MANY PEOPLE OF LOST AND I WE HAVE A SERIES HOUSING CRISIS -- I THINK YOU ALL KNOW THE COST. OF HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA AND HOW IT EXCEEDS BASICALLY ALMOST EVERYWHERE IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY. BUT UNFORTUNATELY PART OF THE REASON THAT OUR COSTS ARE SO HIGH IS BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT PROVIDED THE NUMBER OF UNITS THAT WE NEED FOR OUR POPULATION. WE ARE THE SECOND LOWEST IN THE STATE. OF NUMBER OF HOUSING UNITS PER PERSON OF ANYWHERE IN THE US. FORTY NINE THEN HOUSING UNITS PER CAPITA. SCARCITY INCREASES COST. AND THAT COST THEN. HAS CAUSED HOMELESSNESS ADDITIONALLY. SO WE KNOW WE'RE IN A CRISIS IN MY BILL. WAS DESIGNED REALLY TO ADDRESS THAT CRISIS AND WHILE I SAY THAT IT WAS TO ADDRESS THAT CRISIS IT IS ALSO A MODEST BILL. BECAUSE IT STARTS FROM THE PREMISE THAT. WHILE I PERSONALLY WOULD LIKE TO SEE INCREASED DENSITY IN VARIOUS PLACES. IT STARTS FROM THE PREMISE THAT. ARE EXISTING ZONING RULES IN OUR IN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS UP AND DOWN THE STATE. HAVE ALREADY PROVIDED FOR CONCEPTUALLY. THE NUMBER OF HOUSING UNITS WE NEED. NOW YOU KNOW SOMEONE COULD QUIBBLE LITTLE BUT BASICALLY. ON THE BOOKS. ARE CONCEPTUALLY A GREAT NUMBER OF HOUSING UNITS THEY HAVEN'T BEEN BUILT YET. SO WHAT IS MY BILL DO IT RESPECTS THE EXISTING LOCAL ZONING BUT IT SAYS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS JOIN WITH US. AND GIVE THE HOUSING APPLICANTS SOME CERTAINTY. AND PROCESS THEIR PERMIT IN A SPECIFIC TIME. AND DON'T CHANGE THE RULES WHEN YOU'RE IN THE MIDST OF PROCESSING THAT PERMIT. AND THAT WAY WE COULD ACTUALIZED. THE HOUSING THAT WE'VE ALREADY CONCEPTUALLY APPROVED ON THE BOOKS SO THAT'S REALLY THE VERY CORE OF THIS BILL. IT'S BEEN MYTHOLOGIZED. YES. VERY SENT TO TEASE HAVE TRIED TO CHARACTERIZE IT IS SOMETHING IT IS NOT. IT IS REALLY ABOUT JUST GIVING CERTAINTY TO THOSE PROJECTS WHICH YOU'VE ALREADY CONCEPTUALLY SETTER OKAY SO THAT WHEN AN APPLICANT COMES IN. WITH SOMETHING THAT MEETS YOUR RULES. MEET YOUR EXISTING DESIGN REVIEW STANDARDS MEETS EVERYTHING YOU WOULD -- ASKED. THAT THEN YOU DON'T CHANGE THE RULES MIDSTREAM. YOU DON'T INCREASE THEIR FEES WHILE THAT APPLICANT IS IN PROCESS AND THAT'S ANOTHER THING ON THE FEES PARK. LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SO FEARFUL HORSE FOR TO COVER ALL THE FEES NO. JUST FREEZES THE FEES FOR THAT APPLICATION WHILE THAT APPLICANTS PERMIT IS BEING PROCESSED. AND THE BILL WAS BASED ON WHAT SANTA ROSA DID AFTER THE COFFEE FIRE. IN SANTA ROSA LOST HOW MANY UNITS I DON'T REMEMBER IT CALLED EXACT NUMBER BUT WAS OVER THOUSAND UNITS I THINK WAS IN THE ORDER OF IT WAS MORE AND THREE THOUSAND UNITS. AND THEY KNEW THAT THE NEEDED TO HELP PEOPLE GET BACK INTO THEIR HOMES. SO THEY LOOKED AT THEIR OWN PERMIT PROCESS. AND THEY LOOKED AT HOW TO STREAMLINE IT AND HOW TO HELP PEOPLE. GET BACK WITH WHAT THEY HAD ALREADY AGREED. TO SO THAT'S WHAT THE BILL'S REALLY ORIENTED. TO OF OBVIOUSLY I CAN ADDRESS ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS I REALLY APPRECIATED THE WORK WITH YOUR CONSULTANT HAS BEEN VERY VERY HELPFUL. ALL THE QUESTIONS AND WE IT WAS GREAT WORK TOGETHER -- BUT NOW I WOULD ALLOW MY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT TO INTRODUCE THEMSELVES AND TO SPEAK ON THE BILL. THANK YOU SENATOR. GOOD AFTERNOON -- CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS DAVID GARCIA ON THE POLICY DIRECTOR AT THE TURNER CENTER FOR HOUSING INNOVATION AT UC BERKELEY HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF SENATE BILL THREE THIRTY SO I'M I DON'T THINK I NEED TO REMIND EVERYONE HERE WE ARE IN THE STEPS OF A VERY. SERIOUS AND WORSENING HOUSING CRISIS HERE IN CALIFORNIA -- SO I WON'T BELABOR THE POINT BUT WHAT I WILL SAY IS THAT THE TIME TO FIND SOLUTIONS TO THIS CRISIS. THAT THAT TIME WAS YESTERDAY TODAY WE NEED TO BE. TALKING ABOUT ACTIONS WE WE CAN WE CAN UNDERTAKE AND THAT THE MEASURES PROPOSED IN THIS BILL ARE BOTH -- MEETING FULL AS WELL SENSIBLE AND SO I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. THE ISSUE OF COST AND HOW THIS BILL ADDRESSES THAT SPECIFIC ITEM AS AS OUR WORK AT THE TURNER CENTER HAS SHOWN. BUILDING HOUSING A CALIFORNIA IS INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE PARTICULARLY FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE ACTUALLY HAVE A REPORT. THAT WILL BE RELEASED NEXT MONTH THAT DETAILS THE SPIRALING COST OF LOCUM HOUSING PROJECTS. WE ARE SEEING PROJECTS COME IN AT EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS TO MEET SOMETIMES EVEN NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS PER UNIT TO BUILD IN THESE. RESULTS DOVE TAIL WHAT THE GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE FOUND LAST YEAR THEIR NATIONWIDE REPORT SHOWING THAT CALIFORNIA IS AN EXTREME OUT LIAR IN THE COST IT TAKES TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND SO THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT POINT TO BRING UP BECAUSE AS YOU ALL KNOW THE STATE HAS COMMITTED. SIGNIFICANT NEW DOLLARS TO BUILD NEW FOUR WHEEL HOUSING BUT AS COSTS CONTINUE TO ESCALATE THESE DOLLARS ARE GOING TO BECOME LESS AND LESS EFFECTIVE. AND SO OUR WORK HAS SHOWN AT THESE COSTS ARE DRIVEN BY A VARIETY OF FACTORS BUT CHIEF AMONG THEM ARE UNCERTAIN TIME LINES WENT THE REVIEW PROCESS SEES. AYE CHANGING IMPACT FEES AND SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THIS BILL ACTUALLY PROVIDES LEVEL OF CERTAINTY FOR BUILDERS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING TO BE ABLE TO MEET THEIR CRITICAL DEADLINES TO ALIGN WITH STATE LET PROGRAMS -- THAT THAT'S GOING TO DO A LOTS TO HELP ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF COST WHEN IT COMES TO BUILDING THE UNITS THAT WE ALL AGREE ON WE NEED TO BE BUILDING AS A STATE SO -- I'LL KEEP MY COMMENTS BRIEF I'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT I WANT TO THANK THE SENATOR FOR HER LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE I THINK THE COMMITTEE FOR THE CONVERSATION AND THE COURAGE AND I VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU IN ONE MORE IN SUPPORT AND WILL DO THE ME TO USE. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR ARGUE ARE CURRY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS PEDRO GOLF I WHEN I'M WITH THE NONPROFIT HOUSING ASSOCIATION OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. WE ARE A LONG STANDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION WITH THAT WORKS IN ALL NINE BAY AREA COUNTIES IN OUR MISSION IS. TO FOR BAY AREA WHERE EVERYONE HAS A STABLE AND AFFORDABLE PLACE TO CALL HOME AND WE'RE HERE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SB. THREE THIRTY BECAUSE AS THE SENATOR SAID AND AND DAVID ADDED -- PEOPLE CREATE MORE CERTAINTY AND TRANSPARENCY IN THE APPROVAL PROCESS OF CAN OF BUILDING MORE HOMES BUT SPECIFICALLY AFFORDABLE HOMES. ARE -- OUR MEMBERS -- LIKE OTHER DEVELOPERS HAVE ALSO BEEN IN SITUATIONS WHERE. ONCE THE DEVELOPMENT HAS ONCE AN APPLICATION HAS BEEN TURNED IN THE RULES HAVE CHANGED MIDSTREAM ADDING TO COST -- CAUSING FOR SIGNIFICANT DELAYS BECAUSE OF PORTABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS HAVE TO BUILD WITH SUBSIDIES SO THEY HAVE TO GO OUT AND FIND NEW SOURCES. AND SO NOT ONLY DOES THAT THE LATE THE PROJECT COST THE PUBLIC MORE MONEY BUT IT THE LADIES. BE DELIVERY OF CRITICALLY NEEDED HOMES AFFORDABLE TO LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS. AND SO -- WITH THE CERTAINTY AND TRANSPARENCY THAT THIS BILL WILL PROVIDE WE WE WOULD REALLY WANT TO ENCOURAGE THE COMMITTEE TO TAKE AN AYE VOTE FOR BE BELIEVE THAT THIS WILL MAKE IT EASIER FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE A SAFE AND AFFORDABLE PLACE TO CALL.

WE HAVE TWO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION THEN THE ME TO USE FOLLOWING GOOD AFTERNOON WELCOME. GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU CHAIRMAN -- MY NAME IS PETER PAPADOPOULOS AND I AM. WITH THE MISSION ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AGENCY IN SAN FRANCISCO. AND WE SERVE -- SEVEN THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED CLIENTS A YEAR PREDOMINANTLY LOW INCOME LATINO FAMILIES IN THE AREAS OF COMMUNITY ASSET BUILDING SOCIAL SERVICES AND THEN WE ALSO ARE. IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING BILLS THAT WE BUILD EXTREMELY LOW INCOME VERY LOW INCOME MIDDLE INCOME HOUSING -- IN THAT CONTEXT I THINK WE FELT IT WAS IMPORTANT. TO RAISE OUR OVER ARCHING CONCERNS WHICH COULD BE -- DESCRIBE MOST SIMPLY AS I THINK SOCIAL JUSTICE CONCERNS WITH THIS BILL ESSENTIALLY ARE POTENTIALLY UNINTENDED IMPACTS FROM THE BILL WHICH WE WOULD. BE HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR ON THESE CONCERNS FOR OUR COMMUNITY. I THINK THAT -- OBVIOUSLY WE'RE LOOKING FOR THINGS THAT PROMOTE. VERY MUCH AN EQUITY FIRST LANDS THAT IS WANTING TO MAKE SURE THAT AS WE SPEED UP THINGS LIKE OUR HOUSING PRODUCTION DURING THIS CRISIS WHICH WE KNOW WE NEED TO DO WE ARE VERY MUCH -- FOR EQUITABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WE ARE BUILDERS OURSELVES SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE INCLUDE OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITY MEMBERS. MAKING SURE THAT THEY ARE ARE PROSPEROUS AND STABILIZED THE DURING THIS TIME OUR NEIGHBORHOOD ALONE HAS ALREADY LOST EIGHT THOUSAND LATINO COMMUNITY MEMBERS RECENTLY. AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE FINDING. OUR WAY TO TO MAKE SURE THAT CULTURAL ECO SYSTEMS ARE PROTECTED AND SOMETIMES THAT IS A LITTLE MORE SUBTLE. AND IT ALLOWS THE VOICE OF THE COMMUNITY TO BE HEARD AND IT ALLOWS SOME DISCRETION ON BEHALF OF OUR LOCAL LAND USE BOARDS. WORKING TOGETHER WITH THE ELEMENT TEAMS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE STABILIZING OUR COMMUNITY FIRST AND FOREMOST -- ALREADY WE SEE THAT THIS BILL FROM OUR UNDERSTANDING FOR EXAMPLE WOULD DISRUPT. OUR LATINO CULTURAL DISTRICT STILL WORKING AFTER HUNDREDS OF HOURS BETWEEN CITY AND COMMUNITY TO ESTABLISH ITS DESIGN GUIDELINES SOME OF THOSE DESIGN GUIDELINES WE UNDERSTAND WOULD BE INVALIDATED. BY THIS PROPOSAL SIMILARLY WE UNDERSTAND OUT OF LOS ANGELES BECAUSE OF THE JANUARY FIRST RETROACTIVE TIMELINE THAT A COMMUNITY AREA PLAN THEIR SIMILARLY WOULD ALSO BE. DISRUPTED BY THIS PROCESS -- TO TO NAME A COUPLE MORE PARTICULAR CONCERNS OF PASSAGES. WE CAN CURVE WITH THE FLAGGING THAT WAS DONE IN THE SENATE GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE. REGARDING THE POTENTIAL ISSUE OF A SORT OF SPOT ZONING THAT SEEMS TO BE ALLOWED BY LANGUAGE THAT WE DETAILED IN OUR LETTER -- THAT SEEMS TO SAY YOU CAN DEFER TO A GENERAL PLAN INSTEAD OF A SPECIFIC ZONING IF YOU FEEL SOMEHOW THAT ZONING IS NOT QUITE. IN CONCORDANCE WITH THE SURROUNDING TERRITORY BUT THAT SOMETIMES CAN BE DONE FOR REASONS OF CULTURAL ECO SYSTEM. AS WE MENTIONED LIMITING THE NUMBER OF HEARINGS TO A TOTAL OF FIVE WE THINK IS. A WAY OF OF LIMITING ARE VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES VOICES THAT'S ALREADY BEING OVERRUN BY LARGE FORCES AND THIS IS ONE WAY THAT WE HAVE TO ENGAGE WITH OF ELEMENT. I MAKE SURE OUR COMMUNITY IS ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN THEIR FUTURE WE'D LIKE TO SEE THAT NUMBER EXPANDED OR OVER ELIMINATED OR SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT THAT WE MAKE SURE WE STILL HAVE APPEALS AS A POSSIBILITY RIGHT NOW YOU COULD VERY WELL GO THROUGH A PROCESS AS WE KNOW AND END. UP WITH NO APPEALS WERE THERE TO BE SOME ISSUES. WE UNDERSTAND THERE'S NEW DEMOLITION LANGUAGE TODAY WE'D LIKE TO REVIEW THAT. OF PARTICULAR CONCERN WAS SQUARE FOOTAGE LOSS AND ALSO THE POTENTIAL FOR STATE DENSITY BONUS INTERACTING WITH THIS AS AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND FINALLY WE DO HAVE A CONCERN THAT THERE COULD BE SOME ISSUE WITH THIS. ASSESSING OF FEES AND IMPACT FEES AT THE TIME OF THE PRE OP WHERE THINGS ARE NOT CERTAIN YET AND WE'RE NOT SURE HOW THAT COULD COULD WORK SO WE'D LIKE TO LOOK INTO THAT WITH THE AUTHOR OF POSSIBLE. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS RAND MARTIN HERE ON BEHALF OF THE AIDS HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION FOR THOSE THAT DON'T KNOW HF IS NOT ONLY THE LARGEST PROVIDER OF CARE AND TREATMENT OF PEOPLE WITH HIV IN THE WORLD. BUT IT ALSO HAS A GROWING PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL AND GROWING HOUSING PROGRAM IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY WE ARE ALSO DEVELOPER OF HOUSING FOR LOW INCOME PEOPLE -- WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT THE AUTHOR HAS DONE ON THIS BILL -- A LOT OF PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE -- AND I REALLY DO APPRECIATE THAT AND WE DO CONTINUE TO HAVE A COUPLE OF ISSUES THAT WE STILL LIKE TO WORK OUT WITH HER AS THE BILL. NOW MOVES FORWARD. ONE IS AS MOST PAPADOPOULOS'S HAS INDICATED HAVE HAS TO DO WITH THE OPERATIVE DATE RELATIVE TO GENERAL PLANS ON THAT DATE IS STILL JANUARY FIRST OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE KNOW IT HAS LIMITED IMPACT BUT IT DOES IMPACT IN LOS ANGELES IN PARTICULAR. A COMMUNITY PLAN THAT WAS DEVELOPED OVER THE LAST ELEVEN YEARS I'M WITH LEADERS FROM THE SOUTH LA COMMUNITY -- THAT DIDN'T GO INTO EFFECT UNTIL AFTER JANUARY FIRST OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE'RE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT WHETHER THAT'S GOING TO HAVE IT WHETHER THIS BILL IS GOING TO HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE ABILITY OF THAT. OF THAT TO A PLAN TO BE FULLY REALIZED THE WAY PEOPLE ANTICIPATED IT -- WE WELCOME THE LANGUAGE THAT WAS ADDED TO THE BILL RELATIVE TO DEMOLITION AND WE THINK OVERALL IT'S A IT'S A GOOD SECTION AND GOOD THAT THEY'VE ADDED IT -- UNFORTUNATELY THERE COUPLE THINGS IN THERE THAT WOULD STILL LIKE TO SEE FIXED -- I KNOW THIS IS RECENT LANGUAGE AND WE'RE JUST NOW GETTING A CHANCE TO RESPOND TO IT -- BUT WE ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT -- UNDER POTENTIALLY UNDERMINING THAT'S NOT RIGHT THE THE RIGHT TERM BUT IT IMPEDING THE ABILITY OF THE DENSITY BONUS LAW TO WORK THE WAY IT WAS INTENDED -- TO SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S CLEAR THAT -- THAT USING THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL DOES NOT GET THE DEVELOPER ADDITIONAL DENSITY BONUS POINTS -- AS IT WERE -- AND NUMBER -- TWO THEY TALK ABOUT HAVING THE SAME NUMBER OF BEDROOMS AS BEING THE EQUIVALENTS IN TERMS OF THE SIZE OF THE OF THE UNIT. SAME NUMBER OF BEDROOMS IN LOS ANGELES IN PARTICULAR IS NOT GREAT FOR FAMILIES WHO ARE LIVING IN -- IN A TIGHT SPACES MULTIPLE FAMILIES IN MANY CASES. YOU HAVE MANY PEOPLE LIVING IN THE SAME NUMBER OF BEDROOMS BUT WITH A MUCH SMALLER SQUARE FOOTAGE YOU HAVE MUCH MORE UNACCEPTABLE PLACE -- FOR FOR PEOPLE TO LIVE I'M SORRY BE CONCERNED ABOUT -- ABOUT FIXING THAT -- BOTH THOSE ARE THE TWO REMAINING ISSUES AT THIS POINT THAT WE HAVE -- WITH THE BILL I MEAN LOOK FORWARD -- TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR FURTHER -- IF THIS BILL MOVES FOR THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS A SMILEY CALIFORNIA CITIES AND WE DO HAVE AN OPPOSING THIS AMENDED IN A POSITION ON THIS BILL THE BILL HAS COME A LONG WAY WE CERTAINLY KNOWLEDGE THE EFFORTS. OF THE AUTHOR OUR MAIN CONCERN IS REALLY THE PROJECT SPECIFIC FEES -- THE WAY THE BILL OPERATES NOW WE WOULD BE PROHIBITED FROM CHARGING THOSE BECAUSE IT FREES UP BEFORE WE KNOW WHAT THEY POSSIBLY COULD BE. A MYTH THAT ISSUE GETS RESOLVED I THINK WE CAN GO TO NEUTRAL THANK YOU. THANK YOU JUST AS A REMINDER YOUR NAME AND OKAY SILLY ON BEHALF OF THE CITIES OF BOWMAN CUPERTINO LAFAYETTE IN OPPOSITION.

GOOD AFTERNOON HEIDI FELT ON ON BEHALF OF A NEWLY FORMED STATEWIDE ALLIANCE CALLED A BETTER WAY FORWARD TO HOUSE CALIFORNIA. IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. RECALL REPRESENTING TWO GROUPS OF THE CULTURAL ACTION NETWORK -- WHICH WORKS IN THE MISSION DISTRICT -- BELIEVES THAT THE LATEST ADDITIONS TO THE BILL -- CREATE ESSENTIALLY A DEMOLITION DERBY. THEY ARE NOT GOOD BUT IT NEEDS TO BE EXAMINED THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE. VITAL SOURCE OF SORRY I'M YES I WANNA THINK THE AUTHOR I KNOW WE ARE IN A HOUSING CRISIS AND I THINK THIS POINT OF PART OF THE STATE THAT REMAINS UNAFFECTED. YOU'VE TAKEN A NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS AND I'M SORRY I MISSED YOUR OPENING STATEMENT COULD YOU RUN THROUGH THE AMENDMENTS THAT YOU'VE TAKEN -- OVER ALL THE COMMITTEES I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE PUBLIC TO HEAR I APPRECIATE THAT IT'S IMPORTANT BUT THIS AND I AND I DON'T MEAN TO BE CAVALIER AT ALL BUT THIS BILL. IN AND I'M NOT SAYING THIS IN ANY WAY TO DIMINISH THE STILL VERY BENEFICIAL ASPECTS OF THIS BILL BUT THIS BILL IS A SHADOW OF ITS FORMER SELF. I WOULD BE -- VERY PLEASED TO BE PRESENTING TO YOU THE BILL I ORIGINALLY INTRODUCED AND I WOULD STAND STILL BY THE BILL I ORIGINALLY INTRODUCED. BUT I ALSO APPRECIATE THAT THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS IS SUCH THAT WE NEED TO BE RESPONSIVE LEGITIMATELY RESPONSIVE TO CONCERNS THAT ARE RAISED SO FOR EXAMPLE. THE LIMITATIONS ON PARKING WHICH WE'VE HEARD SOME OF THE OBJECTION NOT ALL TO THE BILL IS SOME IS THE FEAR. ABOUT THE IMPACT ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND BURDEN IN NOTE THAT WE'VE HEARD PRIMARILY -- THAT AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS AND THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY ARE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL BUT LET ME THE POINT I'M TRYING TO MAKE IS THAT. WHY A PAD PARKING IN THERE WHY I HAD THE REMOVAL? OF THE MINIMUM REQUIRED PARKING UNITS IN THE ORIGINAL BILL. IS BECAUSE PARKING ADDS COST. AND I DON'T WANT TO ADD COST WE ARE IN A HOUSING AFFORDABILITY AND A HOUSING SUPPLY CRISIS WE HAVE THE HIGHEST COST OF CONSTRUCTION OF ANYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY. A PARKING UNIT DEPENDING ON THE PROJECT CAN BE MINIMAL FIFTY THOUSAND UPWARDS TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND JUST FOR A PARKING SPOT. SO I WAS TRYING TO BRING DOWN COSTS BUT THERE WAS SO MUCH OBJECTION I COMPLETELY ELIMINATED. DE ANY REFERENCE TO ANYTHING TO DO WITH PARKING SO THAT'S GONE. THERE WAS ALSO CONCERN THAT THE BILL. AFFECTED COASTAL HEIGHT LIMITS SO I PUT IN THE BILL EXPLICITLY THAT THE BILL IN NO WAY CAN IMPACT INTERFERE WITH OR IMPACT OR EFFECT COASTAL HEIGHT LIMIT SO THAT IS EXPLICIT NOW IN THE BILL. THERE WAS ALSO CONCERN THAT THE BILL. WOULD -- THAT I ORIGINALLY FROZE FEES BECAUSE AND WHAT I DIDN'T SAY WHEN I OPEN AND I'M APOLOGIES THIS BILL SUNSETS IN FIVE YEARS THIS IS JUST FOR FIVE YEARS. AND I WAS TRYING TO FREEZE FEES IN ORDER. TO GET THE COST DOWN. BUT THERE WAS. VERY LEGITIMATE INSUBSTANTIAL REACTION TO THAT. SO WE ELIMINATED THAT THE ONLY PORTION WE RETAINED IS THAT ONCE CHAU AYE MY HOUSING APPLICANTS AND THIS COVERS ALL HOUSING IT COULD BE A SINGLE FOR IT COULD BE I'M THE OWNER OF A LOT. I WANT TO PUT IN A SINGLE FAMILY HOUSE SO I GO TO MY LOCAL PERMIT COUNTER I SUBMIT MY INITIAL APPLICATION. MY CITY OF COURSE CAN THEN USUALLY ALWAYS THE APPLICATION IS NOT COMPLETE THEY GO BACK AND FORTH WITH ME MAYBE THERE SOME HEARINGS THEN IT MIGHT THERE'S NO LIMITS ON THE HEARINGS THEN -- THEY ARE DETERMINING WHAT THE FEES ARE. ONCE THEY HAVE DEEMED TO MY APPLICATION COMPLETE THAT IS WHEN THE FEES FREEZE AND IT ONLY FREEZES AROUND MY APPLICATION. NOT ON ANYTHING ELSE SO. I THINK THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT ONE SO I DO APPRECIATE THE QUESTION BUT I DON'T THINK I CAN NECESSARILY GO THROUGH ALL THE OTHER -- ANOTHER. ONE IT WAS ORIGINALLY FOR TEN YEARS NOW IT SUNSETS IN. FIVE ADDITIONALLY. I HAD IN ORIGINAL BILL. THE NIGHT IS WHEN I SAY THIS I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE BE LIKE HOW COULD YOU EVER CONSIDER THIS I HAD SUSPENDED BECAUSE THE WHOLE POINT OF THE BILL WAS TO SUSPEND. SOME OF PUT. A HOLD ON THE THINGS THAT LIMIT HOUSING JUST FOR A LIMITED PERIOD OF TIME SO WE KNOW THAT SOME OF OUR JURISDICTIONS THERE'S BEEN VOTER INITIATIVES. THAT BASICALLY HAVE PREVENTED A LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO UP SOONER PREVENT OR MADE A LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAVE ONLY SO MANY HOUSING. SO WIDE SUSPENDED THOSE VOTER APPROVALS OR THE ABILITY TO PUT SOMETHING BEFORE THE VOTERS. BUT OF COURSE AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT WAS HER CAUSED A LOT OF REACTION SO I GOT RID OF IT. IT'S NO LONGER THERE -- AND I ELIMINATED. I MADE SURE THAT NOTHING IN THE BILL IMPACTS SEA QUEST. SO THOSE ARE AMONG THE AMENDMENTS AND I KNOW THERE ARE COUNTLESS OTHERS BUT I HOPE IF THERE'S ANY OTHER ASPECT THAT WAS OF PARTICULAR CONCERN. I WILL BE HAPPY TO LOOK THROUGH IN AN ANSWER THOSE SPECIFICALLY. YES I'M I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR ALL THE HARD WORK AND AND TAKING ON THE AMENDMENTS -- I STILL HAVE SOME CONCERNS THAT WE CAN TALK ABOUT OFFLINE -- SOMEONE BE VOTING NO TODAY BUT I HOPE TO WORK WITH YOU AND MAYBE WE GET TO THE PLACE WHERE. I CAN VOTE YES ON THE FLOOR THANK YOU. THE OTHER QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE. I DO HAVE A MOTION. WHATEVER MOTION BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER RIVAS SECOND BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER READ OR ALMOST -- WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE MR BETTER YES I WAS HIS NAME SORRY SORRY TO GET MY HAND UP BOOK QUICKLY ENOUGH BUT THAT THIS IS A A VERY QUICK QUESTION I THINK THE AUTHOR KNOWS THAT -- AT LEAST ONE OF MY STE WELL COUPLE MY CITIES -- HAVE ISSUES BUT ONE OF THOSE CITIES IN PARTICULAR IS A CITY THAT PRODUCES A LOT OF HOUSING -- WE'VE TALKED ABOUT -- YOU'RE CONTINUING TO CONVERSE WITH THEM TO SEE IF BY SOME OF THEIR ISSUES CAN BE WORKED OUT I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S ON THE RECORD. YES ABSOLUTELY THE APPRECIATE THAT YES THERE ARE -- AN ARM. THERE WERE A COUPLE OF THEM THAT WERE TIME SEARCH TECHNICAL IN NATURE AND I THINK THOSE ARE THE TYPE OF AMENDMENTS. AS WE'VE DONE SOME CLARIFYING IN TECHNICAL THAT DON'T CHANGE THE SUBSTANCE OF THE BILL BUT HELP TO ADDRESS SOME VERY SPECIFIC CONCERNS THAT. THE CITY THAT TERM. ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOM RACING SO ABSOLUTELY WE AND ON THE BILL GOES TO APPROACH NEXT AND WE WE KNOW THAT THE YOUR CONSULTANT YOUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT CONSULTANT WILL WORK WITH US. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE IF THAT IN DOING SO WE DON'T UP AND ANYTHING ELSE THAT THE COMMITTEES ANALYSIS. WE WOULD NOT WANT TO DO ANYTHING THAT -- INTERFERED WITH YOU KNOW THE DIRECTION THE COMMITTEE WANTS GOING BUT ABSOLUTELY HAVE THAT COMMITMENT. AND THEN THE I JUST WANTED TO ADD THAT. THERE WAS REFERENCE TO THE DEMOLITION PART THE DEMOLITION PART HAS ALWAYS BEEN IN THE BILL ALL WE DID WAS MOVE THE SECTION. IT'S ALWAYS BEEN IN THERE AND WHAT I'M WHAT I'M SAYING IS FROM DAY ONE THIS BILL WAS DESIGNED TO PROTECT OF EXISTING AFFORDABLE HOUSING. I AM THE AUTHOR NOT ALONE WITH MANY PEOPLE BUT I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN THE WRITING AND DELIVERY OF BERKELEY'S RENT CONTROL ORDINANCES SINCE. NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN AND IF THAT AGES ME. SO BE IT. BUT I'VE WORKED ON OUR BERKELEY'S RENT CONTROL ORDINANCE IN. REMEMBER BUT ANYWAY AND I HAVE A STRONG COMMITMENT TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING I DO NOT WANT. PEOPLE WHO ARE CURRENTLY PROTECTED BY RENT CONTROL TO HAVE THIS BILL DISRUPT THEM I DO NOT WANT ANYONE IN A PERMANENTLY AFFORDABLE UNIT TO BE DISRUPTED AND SO WE BUILT IN VERY STRONG PROTECTIONS WHICH IS WHY THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY FOR EXAMPLE IS IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. AND I'LL TAKE THAT AS YOUR CLOTHES THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR -- I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FOR IT I KNOW IT WAS TOUGH I KNOW YOU HAD A LOT OF AMENDMENTS YOU TOOK NOT ALL THAT YOU WANTED TO BUT I THINK WE HAVE A FRAMEWORK RIGHT NOW START TO MOVE FORWARD. SO I APPRECIATE THAT. I DO HAVE A FEW THAT REMAINING CONCERNS WE'VE ADDRESSED SOME OF THOSE AND I'M JUST GOING TO GO THROUGH THOSE -- I HOPE TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON DESIGN STANDARDSAND THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE BILL. WORKING WITH THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT ASSOCIATION ON THE PROJECT SPECIFIC FEE. ISSUE THAT THEY'VE BROUGHT UP AND LASTLY IN WORKING ON REFINING THE DEFINITION AFFECTED CITY AND AFFECTED COUNTY -- AGAIN I I APPRECIATE THE HARD WORK BECAUSE YOU'RE RIGHT HOUSING CRISIS. AND WE'VE GOT TO WE'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. AND WITH THAT I WILL ASK THE SECRETARY DETECTABLE THE MOTION IS DO PASS AND REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS AGUIAR-CURRY HI AGUIAR-CURRY I LACKEY. LACKEY AYE BLOOM.

AND WE'RE GOING TO REMIND EVERYBODY YOU HAVE TWO PEOPLE -- FOR OPPOSITION AND SUPPORT AND THEN THE ME TO USE WILL FOLLOW ALL RIGHTY. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS THIS IS SB ONE EIGHTY TWO IT IS A BILL THAT REDUCES THE RISK OF CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES DAMAGE TO CALIFORNIA'S COMMUNITIES. BY STRENGTHENING LOCAL PLANNING REQUIREMENTS FOR DEVELOPMENT APPROVALS IN VERY HIGH FIRE HAZARD AREAS AND BY DIRECTING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO DEVELOP COMPREHENSIVE RETROFIT. AND FIRE RESPONSE STRATEGIES FOR EXISTING COMMUNITIES IN NEED OF FIRE HARDENING I KNOW THE CHAIR IS WELL AWARE OF THIS ISSUE AND IT IS IN AN AREA WHERE THERE'S A KIND OF EFFORT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. THE INCREASING THREATS OF WHILE FAR TO OUR STATE POSE A SIGNIFICANT RISK TO HOMES AND BUSINESSES. AND WHILE MUCH IS BEING DONE TO FIGHT THESE FIRES AND TO BETTER MANAGE OUR FORESTS. MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE TO HARDEN OUR COMMUNITIES. AND MAKE THEM MORE RESISTANT TO WILDFIRE. AT A MARCH THIRTEENTH HEARING FOCUSED ON DEVELOPMENT IN FIRE PRONE REGIONS THE SENATE GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE COMMITTEE IN THE SENATE NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE. RECOMMENDED THAT THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER ACTION TO BOLSTER LOCAL PLANNING EFFORTS TO DESIGN MORE RESILIENT COMMUNITIES. CONDITION DEVELOPMENT APPROVALS TO ENSURE THAT STRUCTURES AND COMMUNITIES ARE ADEQUATELY PROTECTED FROM FIRE. OR ENCOURAGE DEVELOPMENT OUT OF HARM'S WAY. THAT IS PRECISELY WHAT THIS BILL DOES. AMONG OTHER THINGS THE BILL REQUIRES NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN VERY HIGH FIRE RISK AREAS TO MEET SPECIFIED WILDFIRE RISK REDUCTION STANDARDS. IT REQUIRES LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO VERIFY ON GOING COMPLIANCE WITH THE FENCIBLE SPACE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT AND LOCAL FIRE -- PLAN AND WHILE FIRE HAZARD MITIGATION PLANS. THE DIRECTIONAL OCAL GOVERNMENTS TO DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE RETROFIT STRATEGY FOR STRUCTURES THAT ARE VULNERABLE TO WILDFIRE. INCLUDING BUYS ESTABLISHING GOALS ANTI MINDS FOR COMPLETING RETROFIT WORK AND IDENTIFYING FUNDING SOURCES AND FINANCING STRATEGIES. IT REQUIRES ALL DEVELOP. ALL DEVELOPMENT IN VERY HIGH FIRE RISK AREAS TO MEET SPECIFIED FIRE RESPONSE. WATER INFRASTRUCTURE AND IGNITION REDUCTION STANDARDS. AND FURTHER DIRECTS THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL TO ESTABLISH NEW WILDFIRE RISK REDUCTION STANDARDS THAT ACCOUNT MORE PRECISELY FOR CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE WEATHER TOPOGRAPHY AND DEVELOPMENT PATTERNS. MEMBERS WITH CLIMATE CHANGE CREATING THE POTENTIAL FOR LONGER AND MORE SEVERE WILDFIRES IN CALIFORNIA WHICH MANY IN THIS ROOM HAVE ALREADY EXPERIENCED. IT IS NOW I'M MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER WE ACT TO STRENGTHEN OUR PLANNING POLICIES TO REDUCE THE RISK TO OUR COMMUNITIES. AND TO FUTURE GENERATIONS.

THAT THE TIMING IS CRITICAL TO PASS THIS BILL WE BELIEVE THAT A LOT CAN BE DONE -- ON THE PLANNING SIDE UP FRONT TO REALLY START TO PREPARE OUR COMMUNITIES HARDEN THOSE EXISTING HOMES THAT ARE IN OUR COMMUNITIES WHERE THEY ARE NEEDED. AND ALSO LOOK AT WHAT WE CAN DO FOR NEW DEVELOPMENT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S ADEQUATE PROTECTION IN PLACE SO.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR GOOD AFTERNOON GOOD AFTERNOON AND MEMBERS HI. ONE NOVEMBER IN NOVEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE VOTERS IN BRISBANE CALIFORNIA IN MY DISTRICT MADE A SIGNIFICANT COMMITMENT TO REGIONAL HOUSING. WHEN THEY APPROVED MEASURE JJ WHICH WOULD PERMIT THE DEVELOPMENT OF EIGHTEEN HUNDRED TO TWO THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED UNITS OF HOUSING ON THE BAY LANDS? THIS WOULD MORE THAN DOUBLE THE HOUSING STOCK IN THE CITY OF BRISBANE. PASSED THE MEASURE JJ WAS A WATERSHED MOMENT FOR BRISBANE IN THE STATE. JJ REVERSES NEARLY FIFTY YEARS OF VOTES AGAINST DEVELOPMENT OF THE BAIL AND IT REPRESENTS THE TYPE OF LOCAL LEADERSHIP WE NEED THROUGHOUT THE BAY AREA. N. THE STATE IF WE ARE GOING TO PUT A REAL DENT IN THE HOUSING CRISIS. SB SIX SEVENTY TWO ALLOWS BRISBANE TO FOCUS ITS EFFORTS ON GETTING THE BAY LANDS AN IMPORTANT REGIONAL PROJECT. DEVELOPED PROPERLY THE BILL DOES DOES THIS BY INSURING CONSISTENCY IN BRISBANE'S REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ARE ALLOCATIONS. DURING THIS PLANNING CYCLE AND THE NEXT IN RECOGNITION OF THE COMMITMENT ALREADY MADE BY THE CITY'S VOTERS TO DOUBLE DOUBLE ITS HOUSING STOCK. SB SIX SEVENTY TWO IS NOT A GIFT THAT IS THE BENEFIT TO BRISBANE UNDER THE BILL IS ONLY AVAILABLE IF THE CITY CONTINUES TO MAKE STEADY PROGRESS WITH THE BALANCE DEVELOPMENT UNDER THE OVERSIGHT.

ON THE BAY LANDS IS HEAVILY ENVIRONMENTALLY IMPACTED WAS A FORMER LANDFILL -- AND RAILYARD -- THE PROJECT WILL BE COMPLEX WILL REQUIRE YEARS OF COORDINATION BETWEEN VARIOUS -- AGENCIES THE CITY THE DEVELOPER AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE SO -- THIS BILL IS REALLY AN IMPORTANT MEASURE TO ALLOW THE ALLOW PLANNING CONSISTENCY FOR THE COMMUNITY -- AND WITH THAT REALLY AS FOR YOUR IPHONE.

CASKEY WELCOME. MADAM CHAIR -- GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS LET ME START OFF BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. ON PAGE EIGHT OF THE ANALYSIS. IN FULL I SB THIRTEEN ADDRESSES THE TOP EIGHTY YOU BARRIERS IDENTIFIED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT WHICH INCLUDES REDUCING IMPACT FEES. ELIMINATING OWNER OCCUPANCY AND PROVIDING A SAFE PATH OF FOR I'M PERMITTED EIGHTY USED TO BE BROUGHT UP TO CODE. WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT STUDIES FROM PLACES SUCH AS THE CITY OF SANTA CRUZ AND UC BERKELEY THEY HAVE SHOWN THAT DEVELOPER IMPACT FEES ARE EXCESSIVELY HIGH FOR ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS. FOR INSTANCE UC BERKELEY FOUND THAT SOME LOCALITIES ARE CHARGING AS MUCH AS FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER UNIT. AND THAT NUMBER DOESN'T EVEN INCLUDE THE IMPACT FEES CHARGED BY DID YOU TELL THE DISTRICTS AND OTHER DISTRICTS MANY HOMEOWNERS THAT WANT TO BUILD A THE USE A READER STOPPED IN THEIR TRACKS WERE BILLED THEM ILLEGALLY I'M PERMITTED. WHEN THEY'RE HANDED THAT THESE FEES IS ESTIMATED THAT THERE ARE NEARLY? 330-010-00300 THOUSAND AND PERMITTED UNITS IN THE GREATER LOS ANGELES AREA ALONE. EIGHTY USER BUILT ON LOTS THAT ARE HAVE ALREADY HAVE ALREADY PAID DEVELOPMENT FEES HOMEOWNERS SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY. THEM AGAIN LET ALONE PAY THE AMOUNT CHARGED FOR THE PRIMARY UNIT. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT HOMEOWNER CAN EXPAND THEIR HOUSE FOR A BED FOR BEDROOM KITCHEN A BATHROOM AND THEY WOULD PAY ZERO IMPACT FEES. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS I THINK I MENTIONED THIS LAST YEAR MY WIFE AND I BUILT A FOUR HUNDRED FORTY SQUARE FOOT. ADDITION ONTO OUR HOUSE PUT ANOTHER. STOVE IN A BRAND NEW BATHROOM AND FOUR HUNDRED FORTY FEET IT WAS A ONE DAY PERMIT. OF ONE DAY OVER THE COUNTER -- PERMIT AND WE DIDN'T PAY ANY IMPACT FEES. SO SB THIRTEEN ALSO ADDRESSES THE OWNER OCCUPANCY ORDINANCES WHICH REQUIRED THAT THE OWNER TO LIVE ON EITHER THE EIGHTY YOU OR THE PRIMARY UNIT AND WE'RE NEARING THE BLOOM LANGUAGE THAT WAS ADOPTED BY THIS COMMITTEE EARLIER. THERE IS THERE'S AN UNFOUNDED FEAR. THAT INVESTORS WILL BE BUYING HOMES JUST TO BUILD THEIR EIGHTY USED TO RENT THEM OUT. IN REALITY STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT THIS FEAR. IS MISS PLACE AND THAT THE MAJORITY OF EIGHTY USE ARE BUILT BY HOMEOWNERS TO HOUSE FAMILY AND FRIENDS. THE CITY OF PORTLAND DID A STUDY THAT FOUND THAT OUT OF ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY YOU SURVEY ONLY 10% WERE BUILT BY INVESTORS. OWNER OCCUPANCY REQUIRES -- REQUIREMENTS LIMIT THE MARKETABILITY OF EIGHTY USE AND PREVENTS THE CONSTRUCTION OF THEM. THERE HAVE BEEN BANKS REFUSING TO GIVE A LOAN OUT TO HOMEOWNERS BECAUSE OF THIS REQUIREMENT. THERE IS NO OTHER TYPE OF RESIDENTIAL UNIT THAT HAS SUCH RESTRICTIONS THE STATE OF OREGON IS ON THE VERGE OF BANNING HOME OCCUPANCY AND SEATTLE JUST RECENTLY PASSED AN ORDINANCE PREVENTING AT CALIFORNIA SHOULD FOLLOW IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF WILL HAVE FIVE YEAR PERIOD. TO SEE HOW THAT LOOKS. OUT WE NEED TO ADDRESS THESE REMAINING BARRIERS THAT PROFESSIONALS RESEARCHERS AND BANKERS HOMEOWNERS AND LEGISLATURE HAVE IDENTIFIED AS IMPORTANT ISSUES WITH ME TODAY ARE A COUPLE OF EXPERTS. WE HAVE A STEEP ALEJO'S WHO'S DEPRESSED THE PRESIDENT OF PRE FAB EIGHTY YOU AND I HAVE DOCTOR BEEN THAT -- MUKHERJEE MUJAHID SKEWS ME DOCTOR WHO'S A PROFESSOR IN THE DEPARTMENT CHAIR OF URBAN PLANNING AT UCLA. DOCTOR. WELCOME THANK YOU THANK YOU -- GOOD AFTERNOON. MY MY RESEARCH IS ON INFORMAL HOUSING WHICH I CALLED. ON PERMITTED AND UNREGULATED HOUSING AND I USED TO DO THIS MORE IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES BUT RECENTLY LAST FEW YEARS -- CALIFORNIA AND CITY OF LOS ANGELES PARTICULARLY. BY LOOKING AT SALES REAL ESTATE SALES LISTINGS UP TRY TO ESTIMATE HOW MANY ON PERMITTED SINGLE FAMILY HOMES HOW MANY UNITS. HOW MANY UNCOMMITTED ES DE USER THERE WITH SINGLE FAMILY HOMES IN THE CITY OF LA AND MY ESTIMATE SO WE HAVE ABOUT? FIFTY THOUSAND IN THE CITY OF LA AND ROUGHLY. TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND IN THE COUNTY OF LA -- SINCE THE VARIOUS. SB TEN SIXTY NINE IN AB TWENTY NINE TWENTY TWO NINETY NINE LOS HERE THE CITY OF LA HAS HAD SUCCESS. IN A LOVING COMMITTED A. B. USE. AND WE HAVE SEEN. ALMOST TEN THOUSAND TO PERMIT APPLICATIONS FOR EXCESS THREE DWELLING UNITS IN THE CITY OF LA. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THE CITY OF LA SUCCESS. HAS LARGELY BEEN BASED ON THE LACK OF THE OWNER OCCUPANCY. REQUIREMENT IN THE CITY -- THE CITY OF LA ALSO HAS. RELATIVELY LITTLE. PERMIT FEES NOT PERMIT FEES BUT DEVELOPMENT FEES RELATED TO EIGHTY YOU SAID THOSE TO HAVE BEEN. A KEY IN THIS MOVE TO WOODS MORE FORMAL LADY USE. N.. I THINK IT WOULD BE. HELPFUL TO HAVE SIMILAR REQUIREMENTS ACROSS THE OTHER CITIES IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND CERTAINLY THE STATE WE WILL ARE LIKELY TO SEE. MANY MORE PERMITTED A TO USE IF THE FEES WERE LESS IF OWNER OCCUPANCY REQUIREMENTS WILL LOWER. AND IT IS. MY ESTIMATES ARE IF IF WE DO HAVE FIFTY THOUSAND ON COMMITTED UNITS. THAT IS ABOUT SEVEN AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS OF REAL ESTATE VALUES THAT COULD BRING IN -- SEVENTY FIVE MILLION OR SO IN REAL ESTATE TAXES EVERY YEAR AT THE CITY COUNTY LEVEL THAT WOULD BE THREE HUNDRED MILLION. SO THERE MIGHT BE WAYS OF MAKING UP FOR LOST REVENUE ON THE DEVELOPMENT FEES SIDE THROUGH PROPERTY TAXES. BUT WE WOULD HAVE WE BEEN BILL AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO REGULATE SOME OF THESE UNITS AND STOP THE ONES THAT ARE PARTICULARLY. DANGEROUS. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH WELCOME. I THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE -- MY NAME IS STEVE LAOS -- I'M THE PRESIDENT OF PRE FAB EIGHTY YOU -- I'E BEEN BUILDING A USE FOR ABOUT FOURTEEN YEARS NOW -- SO I'VE I'VE SEEN THE CHANGE -- IN THE EIGHTY YOU INDUSTRY -- SINCE -- PURELY LEGISLATION IS TO AND AND TO WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW -- I BUILT OVER A HUNDRED EIGHTY OF THEM SCATTERED ACROSS MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS -- SO I'VE SEEN A LOT OF DIFFERENT CITIES AND AND AND HOW THEY REACT TO EIGHTY USE -- WE KEEP ABOUT FIFTEEN TO TWENTY ACTED BUILDS IN ABOUT THIRTY TO FIFTY IN THE DESIGN AND APPROVAL PROCESS SO WE WERE VERY AWARE ABOUT WHAT'S ACTIVELY GOING ON IN THE MARKET SO I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU SOME INFORMATION ABOUT. THE MARKET ITSELF AND THEN AND THEN HELP -- REALLY FOCUS ON THESE TO THESE TWO KEY ISSUES OF HONOR OCCUPANCY AND IMPACT FEES. SO RIGHT NOW WE'VE DONE A STUDY OF OF OF THE OF THE MARKET AND THERE'S ABOUT NINE MILLION HOMES IN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT WOULD QUALIFY FOR AN EIGHTY YOU -- WITH STUDIES COMING OUT OF THE BAY AREA COUNCIL -- YOU'RE DOING RESEARCH ON HOMEOWNER INTEREST -- THE INTEREST LEVELS ABOUT 25% SO THAT WOULD MEAN THAT IN CALIFORNIA THERE'S ROUGHLY ABOUT TWO POINT TWO FIVE MILLION -- HOMES THAT WOULD BE INTERESTED IN DOING EIGHTY OF SO. NEED TO SAY THERE'S A THERE'S A HUGE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS AFFORDABLE HOUSING WITH EIGHTY YEARS AND I THINK IT'S MUCH GREATER THAN MOST PEOPLE -- EVEN EVEN THINK THAT'S POSSIBLE. AS WE SPEAK LA IS RECORDED OVER TEN THOUSAND A YOU APPLICATIONS SINCE. SINCE THE EARLY TWENTY SEVENTEEN BILL FROM MY KOWSKI -- AND WE'RE CURRENTLY WORKING ON A DEAL WITH SAN JOSE RIGHT NOW TO PRODUCE FIVE THOUSAND UNITS FOR THEM ---AND FOCUSING ON THEM BEING AFFORDABLE AND AN EXPEDITED -- AND WE'RE WORKING ON SIMILAR EFFORTS WITH SAN MATTEO NAPA SONOMA COUNTY AS WELL AS OAKLAND SO THE INTEREST LEVEL IS DEFINITELY THERE THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT -- EVERYBODY SEES THIS IS A VIABLE WAY TO ADDRESS FOR WILL HOUSING BUT WHAT DOES THAT REALLY MEAN. SO WHEN WE LOOK AT EIGHTY USE AND WE AND WE DO EIGHTY USE AND WE ACTUALLY PROVIDE FINANCING IN HOUSE WHAT IT MEANS IS THAT WE CAN GENERATE HOMES ACTUALLY -- CAN BE RENTED OUT AT 15250% OF THE LOCAL A MY LEVELS -- AND I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT BECAUSE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A PRODUCT HERE. THAT DOESN'T REQUIRE SUBSIDIES. SO THERE'S NOT A LOT OF RED TAPE IT DOESN'T REQUIRE INFRASTRUCTURE DOESN'T REQUIRE US ALLOCATING LAND -- IT'S A IT'S A PRETTY SEAMLESS PRODUCT IN TERMS OF OF WHAT CAN BE DONE HERE AND AND AS AN EXAMPLE WE'RE ACTUALLY WRAPPING UP A PROJECT-- IN DAVIS WHICH I THOUGHT WOULD BE OF INTEREST TO YOU -- THE THE EIGHTY YOU IS IS ACTUALLY COSTING THEM EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY DOLLARS A MONTH -- FINANCED. AND SO MARGUERITE UNITS ARE GOING FOR ABOUT TWENTY TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH SO THAT'S ABOUT A THIRTEEN HUNDRED DOLLAR THIRTEEN SEVENTY SAVINGS AND THAT PUTS THEM AT RIGHT ABOUT 50% THE AND MY LEVEL TO PUT A FAMILY MEMBER IN THAT UNIT SO -- AND AGAIN ALL WITHOUT SUBSIDIES SO HE HE THESE THIS EFFORT HERE IS IS HUGELY IMPORTANT IN A AND I I WANT TO I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT BUT WHEN WE LOOK AT THE THINGS THAT ARE BARRIERS -- OWNER OCCUPANCY IS IS DEFINITELY -- IS A CONCERN AS AS AS THE CENTER MENTIONED. IN EIGHTY USE ARE THE ONLY THING THAT SEEMS TO BE SITTING ON SINGLE FAMILY PROPERTIES THAT ARE GETTING IN ON A ROCK HITS THE REQUIREMENTS. AND IT'S STRANGE THAT EVEN SHOWS UP TIED TO EIGHTY USE GOING INTO MULTI FAMILY WHERE WE THAT SAME MULTI FAMILY PROPERTY WE CAN BUILD A DUPLEX AND THERE'S NO ON OUR OCCUPANCY ON IT. SO IT IT IT'S A IT'S A LITTLE STRANGE TO DO THIS AND HOMEOWNERS ARE VERY RECEPTIVE TO THAT -- BUT BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU THAT THAT AS A BUILDER OF EIGHTY USE AND AND REALLY THE NUMBER ONE BUILDER VIDEOS IN THE STATE. 80% OF OUR BUSINESS IS DONE FOR FAMILIES SO I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S A FEAR THAT -- BUT THIS COULD BE SOMETHING WHERE INVESTORS COME IN AND AND RUIN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. BUT BUT WITHOUT WITHOUT ANYBODY YOU KNOW REALLY. IF FOCUSING ON RESTRICTING THAT. WE'RE WE'RE STILL DOING 80% IN AREAS LIKE LIKE OAKLAND THAT DOESN'T HAVE OWNER OCCUPANCY REQUIREMENTS. SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT THAT THAT THERE'S A FEAR BUT IT'S NOT IT'S NOT BASED IN FACT IT'S BASED IN YOU KNOW A POTENTIAL OUR CONCERN OF WHAT COULD HAPPEN. WE DO KNOW AS AS CENTER MENTIONED FROM PORTLAND THAT -- THAT WENT OUT ON OUR COMMITTEE WAS REMOVED SEVERAL YEARS BACK IT YOU KNOW THEY'RE THEY'RE STILL SEEING THAT SPECULAR BILL SPECULATIVE BILLS ARE ONLY. 10% OF THE MARKET -- WE ALSO KNOW THAT. WHEN WE LOOK TO MARKETS THAT ARE MORE DEVELOPED AND TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THEM? THERE ARE FOUR MARKETS THAT ARE THE BIGGEST EIGHTY MARKETS IN IN NORTH AMERICAN THAT'S PORTLAND. LOS ANGELES VANCOUVER IN AUSTIN AND ALL OF THEM HAVE ONE THING IN COMMON. THEY DON'T HAVE OWNER OCCUPANCY RESTRICTIONS. SO IT'S IF WE'RE GOING TO TAP INTO THE POTENTIAL OF EIGHTY USE. IT'S IT'S INCUMBENT THAT WE FIND A WAY TO REMOVE THAT OUR OCCUPANCY REQUIREMENTS. IS THAT IS THAT IS SOMETHING THAT HOMEOWNERS JUST DON'T SEEM TO UNDERSTAND. AND I THINK IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT THING WHEN WE GET INTO IMPACT FEES THAT'S ANOTHER PIECE OF THIS PUZZLE THAT I I THINK IS A IS A BIG DEAL BREAKER -- WE JUST RECENTLY COMPLETED A PROJECT IN DUBLIN. THE TOTAL FEES WERE THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THREE HER SQUARE FOOT UNIT THE EIGHTY YOU COST NINETY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. SO THOSE FEES REPRESENT ABOUT DIVVY UP THE FEES THE ACTUAL BUILDING PERMIT PORTION OF IT IS ONLY THIRTY NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS. SO -- REALLY SAYING IS THAT THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT TWENTY SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS WORTH OF IMPACT FEES TIED TO THIS THREE HUNDRED SQUARE FOOT EIGHTY YOU. AND I I THINK WE NEED TO ADDRESS THIS BECAUSE THERE'S A THERE'S A EVEN AT THE CITY LEVEL THERE'S A MISUNDERSTANDING ABOUT THAT PROPORTIONATE. SCALE AND HOW TO APPROPRIATELY DEAL WITH THAT. AND WHEN THERE'S A MISUNDERSTANDING THERE'S A TENDENCY TO LEAVE THINGS THE WAY THEY ARE AND MAKE THE HOMEOWNER THAT THE THE ONE WHO BURDENS THAT RATHER THAN ADDRESS IT AND AND THAT'S WHY I THINK IT REALLY DOES NEED TO BE ADDRESSED. AT THIS LEVEL ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I ALWAYS TELL PEOPLE WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS IS WHEN WE BRING TWO SCENARIOS AND COMPARE THEM TO EACH OTHER. WE LOOK AT IN ADDITION AND WE LOOK AT AN EIGHTY YOU OF THE SAME PROPERTY THE SAME SIZE HOUSE. ONE PERSON DOESN'T ADDITION THE OTHER PERSON DOES THE DATE THE EIGHTY YOU THE ADDITION ISN'T ASSESSED ANY OF THOSE IMPACT FEES. BUT YET THE EIGHTY YOU IS ONE SOLUTION THE ADDITION JUST CREATES A A MCMANSION PROBLEM FOR US. THE OTHER IS ACTUALLY PROVIDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUT YET THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING SOLUTION IS GETTING HIT WITH THE IMPACT FEES. SO WE REALLY NEED TO LOOK AT THIS AND THINK ABOUT THIS AND UNDERSTAND IT BECAUSE IT ISN'T AS IF WE'RE TAKING MONEY AWAY FROM CITIES WHEN WE TALK ABOUT. REMOVING THIS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ACTUALLY GETTING THEM TO UNDERSTAND IT IN THE SAME WAY THEIR UNDERSTANDING THAT ADDITION WHICH ISN'T HELPING THE CITY OUT AT ALL CAN YOU WRAP IT UP. YES THANK YOU THAT'S ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE OTHERS IN SUPPORT PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR ADAM WRIGLEY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN STRONG SUPPORT THANKS.

DAVID GARCIA TURNER CENTER FOR HOUSING INNOVATION AT UC BERKELEY IN SUPPORT. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS MICHAEL GOING WITH THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION HERE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHERS IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. SEEING NONE WILL MOVE OVER TO THE OPPOSITION [inaudible] ME [inaudible] GOOD AFTERNOON. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS. EXCUSE ME J. SLIGHTLY CALIFORNIA CITIES. WE HAVE AN APOSTLE SUBMITTED POSITIONS BILL WE'VE WORKED A LOT. WITH CENTER Y. CASKEY IN THE SUMMER BLOOM ON ON THESE VARIOUS CD YOU BILLS OVER THE YEAR. I THINK THAT THE MAIN STICKING POINT REALLY IS AROUND YOUR FEES WE'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT IMPACT FEES. AND IT IS LIKE A MINOR ONE THAT YOU KNOW THE IMPACT FEES AND WE DON'T MAKE MONEY ON IT. IF WE'RE GONNA YOU KNOW THE GENTLY BEFORE WAS TALK ABOUT HOW YOU KNOW WE'RE IS CAN DEPRIVE CITIES OF MONEY. I THINK WE DON'T HAVE THE IMPACT FEES ARE WE'RE DEPRIVING RESIDENTS OF THE SERVICES THAT THEY'RE GONNA DEMAND WHEN THEY LIVE IN OUR COMMUNITY -- BUT WE DO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IT CAN BE A PROBLEM AND IT CAN BE A BEAR AND I THINK YOU KNOW WHAT THOSE FEES STUDY COMING OUT WE SERVE OUR WORK IN THE LEGISLATURE IN ADDRESSING. ON THAT THE FEE ISSUE -- BUT YOU KNOW. WE WITH THAT PROVISION IN THE BILL WE MUST RESPECTFULLY -- REMAIN OPPOSED LOS AMENDED. THANK YOU [inaudible] WELCOME -- MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS ERIN HOLLAND PUBLIC INFORMATION OFFICER FOR THE NORTH TAHOE FIRE PROTECTION DISTRICT ON BEHALF OF FIRE CHIEF MIKE SCHWARTZ. NORTH TAHOE FIRES A SPECIAL FIRE DISTRICT SERVING MOST OF THE CALIFORNIA SIDE OF THE LAKE TAHOE BASIN. THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF A TRUE CRISIS IN REGARD TO HOUSING. AS A PUBLIC SAFETY AGENCY OPERATING IN A HIGH END SEASONAL RESORT TOWN WE FEEL THE CRISIS OF AFFORDABLE WORKFORCE HOUSING TO OUR CORE. AND WE ADMIRE AND SUPPORT THE AUTHORS DEDICATION TO SEEK SOLUTIONS HOWEVER WE MUST STATE A POSITION OF OPPOSE AS WRITTEN. DUE TO THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF SB THIRTEEN IN ITS CURRENT FORM. AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS NOT THE ONLY CRISIS THAT WE FACE. THE FLOW THE SLOW MOVING CRISIS LOOMING OVER ALL OF US IN CALIFORNIA IS INSURE ABILITY OR THE LACK THERE OF IN MY FIRE DISTRICT SEVEN OUT OF TEN HOMEOWNERS ARE BEING FACED WITH CANCELLATIONS OR NON RENEWALS FOR SINGLE FAMILY HOMES. THESE ARE HOMES THAT HAVE DEFENSIBLE SPACE THAT MEET THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL'S CODE REQUIREMENTS AND THAT WERE BUILT WITH ACCEPTABLE MATERIALS. THESE HOMEOWNERS PAY THEIR PREMIUMS ON TIME AND HAVE A SOLID HISTORY OF NO CLAIMS. AND ARE BEING BLANKETED BY THE ZIP CODE WITH CANCELLATIONS OR INCREASES THAT ARE PUTTING THEIR MONTHLY INSURANCE PREMIUMS. UP THERE WITH THEIR MONTHLY MORTGAGE PAYMENTS. WHAT IS THAT GOING TO DO TO PROPERTY VALUES WHO WILL FINANCE HOMES THAT CAN'T BE INSURED AND WHO CAN PURCHASE A HOME WITH THE MONTHLY INSURANCE PREMIUM AS HIGH AS THEIR MORTGAGE? A LARGE PORTION OF THE STATE IS RATED AS HIGH OR VERY HIGH FIRE DANGER LIKE MY FIRE DISTRICT. AN EXISTING HOMEOWNERS ARE STRUGGLING TO FIND INSURERS. EIGHTY USE WITHIN HIGH FIRE DANGER AREAS ARE NO LONGER REQUIRED TO MEET MANY OF THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL'S CODE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS. THAT APPLY TO OTHER DWELLINGS IN THESE AREAS AS A RESULT OF EFFORTS TO KEEP EIGHTY USE AFFORDABLE. THIS MEASURE OLYMPIC IT ELIMINATES THE MITIGATION FEES THAT WOULD FIND THE ADDITIONAL FIRE SERVICE PROTECTION REQUIRED FOR THIS ADDITIONAL DENSITY. THAT IS LACKING FIRE PROTECTION SYSTEMS. OUR STATIONS MANY OF THEM ARE AT CAPACITY WITHOUTTHESE FEES WE DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO FIND MORE PERSONNEL FOR ADDITIONAL APPARATUS. AFTER THE RECENT DEVASTATING FIRE SEASONS SEASONS THAT HAVE SET NEW RECORDS FOR CALIFORNIA AND LOSS OF MIKE'S. IN LOSS OF LIFE AND PROPERTY IT IS ALL TOO CLEAR THAT FIRE LIFE SAFETY REQUIREMENTS CANNOT BE OVERLOOKED OR WAIVED FOR ANY REASON. ADDING DENSITY ADDS RISK. WAVING CODES AND FEES WAVES SAFETY PERIOD. MEASURES TO ADD DENSITY MUST INCLUDE FIRE LIFE SAFETY CODES AND MUST INCLUDE MITIGATION MEASURES TO MAINTAIN FIRE PROTECTION SERVICE LEVELS THAT MEET THE DEMANDS OF AN INCREASE SERVICE POPULATION. FIRE DISTRICTS ARE WITHOUT A REVENUE SOURCE TO KEEP US TO KEEP UP WITH POPULATION GROWTH AND THE NEW SERVICE AN INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IT DEMANDS. AS A RESULT OF PROPOSITION TWO EIGHTEEN FIRE DISTRICTS ABILITY TO LEVY SURCHARGES FEES ARE ASSESSMENTS. IS NOT SIMPLE OR LIKELY TO BE ACHIEVED. EIGHTY USE MAY NOT OUT PARCELS BUT THEY WILL ADD DENSITY. MY DISTRICT ALREADY HAS A SCALABLE FEEL FEE SCHEDULE WHERE BY OUR FEES ARE RELATED TO THE ADDITIONAL SQUARE FOOTAGE OR FUEL BEING ADDED TO THE FOREST. KEEPING DEVELOPMENT AFFORDABLE. EIGHTY USE ARE ALLOWED TO BE CONSTRUCTED UP TO TWELVE HUNDRED SQUARE FEET IN MOST COMPETE COMMUNITIES THAT IS THE SIZE OF A TYPICAL THREE BEDROOM TWO BATHROOM SINGLE FAMILY HOME. IN THE WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE THAT MAY BE CONSIDERABLY LARGER THAN THE ORIGINAL WELLING. THERE ARE NO PROVISIONS THAT REQUIRE THESE UNITS TO ADDRESS WORKFORCE HOUSING ISSUES BY RENTING FOR BELOW MARKET PRICE. THERE ARE NO PROVISIONS THAT PROHIBIT THESE UNITS FROM BEING PLACED INTO VACATION RENTALS. AND THERE ARE NO PROVISIONS THAT REQUIRE THE UNIT ACTUALLY BE RENTED OUT AT ALL AND NOT SIMPLY BE TREATED AS A CHEAP WORK AROUND FOR A HOMEOWNER TRYING TO BUILD ON IN ADDITION. THESE ARE ALL UNFORTUNATE CONSEQUENCES OF ALLOWING THIS WELL INTENDED BILL TO PASS IS WRITTEN AND DO NOT FULFILLTHE MAJORS INTENT OF ADDRESSING THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS ESPECIALLY IN THE WAKE OF THIS INSURANCE CRISIS. WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT YOU OPPOSE THE BILL AS WRITTEN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. A GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS KAREN LAYING ON THE OF THE SOLANO COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS THE OPPOSITION IS BASED ENTIRELY ON THE CODE ENFORCEMENT PIECE OF THAT THEY DID OF A CHICKEN COOP CONVERTED TO AN EIGHTY YOU AT ONE POINT THAT THEY HAD TO ABATE. SO THEY'RE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT PIECE SPECIFICALLY THANK YOU. JUST YOUR NAME IN YOUR THE CHICKEN COOP GOT ME. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS ENTRY ENTRY ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF BEVERLY HILLS AND OPPOSITION. SURPRISE.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH ALL RIGHT WE HAVE NO OTHERS IN OPPOSITION OTHERS ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU ARE ALMOST MADAM CHAIR AND JUST TO JUST TO BE CLEAR THERE'S SEVERAL AMENDMENTS THAT WERE -- OFFERED IN AND THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL DID ACCEPT THOSE AMENDMENTS WE HEARD SOME. TESTIMONY RIGHT NOW AS FAR AS OPPOSED AND UNLESS AMEND IT. BUT THERE WAS SOME SEVERE AMENDMENT -- THAT WERE OR OFFERED AND ACCEPTED BY BY THE AUTHOR IS THAT CORRECT. YES IT IS MY REPUTATION PRECEDES ME SO I'M WHICH I HAVE ACCEPTED THE AMENDMENTS CONTAINED IN THAT REPORT -- I THIS IS STE -- THE FOURTH YEARS I'VE HAD AND ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT BILL AND IT'S GENERALLY THE SAME. GROUP OF PEOPLE OR SAME INTERESTS THAT HAVE OPPOSED THE BILL SO I'M I THINK SOME OF THE OF THE SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO ABOUT OPPOSE WHEN THEY GET A CHANCE TO LOOK AT THE AMENDMENT TO LOOK AT THAT THEY MIGHT WITHDRAW OR GO NEUTRAL ON IT THAT'S OUR OUR HOPE. BUT I WOULD IMAGINE THEY'LL STILL BE PEOPLE WHO WILL OPPOSE. ANYTHING THAT HAS WHITE HOUSE HIS NAME AND EIGHTY YOU I GET I GET THAT. I GET IT. BUT I THINK IT'S SIX IT'S SIGNIFICANTLY ALTERED THE THE CONCERNS THAT THEY HAVE WITH -- IMPACT FEES AT A CERTAIN SIZE WE'RE WE'VE CUT IT OFF AT SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY FEET AFTER THAT THE IMPACT FEES ARE THERE AND HOMEOWNERSHIP MERE -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOM SPELL THAT WILL ALLOW FOR NO HOMEOWNERSHIP FOR FIVE YEARS I'M. I EXPECT TO STUDY IT EXTENSIVELY TO DETERMINE WHAT THE THE TRUE IT IMPACT IMPACT HIS BUT THOSE SEEM TO BE THAT THE TWO BIG ENCHILADAS THAT ARE CONCERNING PEOPLE [inaudible] THANK YOU. ANY OTHER SUB QUESTIONS ASSEMBLYMEMBER BLOOM QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS. I CAN NOT THAT I I I CAN ASK A QUESTION THAT HAS IT REALLY BEEN FOUR YEARS. SINCE -- YOU AND I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS -- ISSUE FOR A LONG TIME THAT THAT'S A THAT'S FOR SURE AND IT IS -- A REMARKABLE HOW MANY -- UNITS HAVE BEEN BUILT IN THAT PERIOD OF TIME. I THINK -- YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF RESPONDING TO THE HOUSING CRISIS THE THIS RELATIVELY SIMPLE CHANGE AROUND EIGHTY USE. HAS PRODUCED A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF HOUSING -- WHEREAS OTHER EFFORTS UNFORTUNATELY HAVE OR MANY OF THEM HAVE HAVE LANGUISHED -- SO I'M GLAD THAT -- YOU AND I CONTINUE TO TO TO BE -- OF PUSHING THIS A LONG WEEK -- ALONG WITH TWO OTHER MEMBERS HAVE FOR THE HAVE LEGISLATION THIS YEAR THERE'S INTENSE INTEREST IN THE SUBJECT I THINK BECAUSE OF A AS AS I'VE. FOR A SUGGESTED -- TO TOO MANY AT LEAST IN MY COMMUNITIES -- IT THIS IS A AN EFFORT THAT IS SUPPORTED BY BOTH HIM BEES AND THEN THESE. ARE THE FOLKS WHO I TALKED -- TO IN MY DISTRICT WHO HAVE TYPICALLY BEEN. OF THE FOLKS WHO HAVE OPPOSED A DEVELOPMENT HAVE EMBRACED IN WELCOME TO EIGHTY IS. AND TO AND OF COURSE -- THOSE SIR WHO I JOIN WITH AND IN IN PROMOTING ADDITIONAL HOUSING EFFORTS OF HAVE ALSO HAVE ALSO. BEEN -- BEEN VERY ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT EIGHTY IS I THINK THE CHANGES THAT ARE -- THAT ARE IN -- IN YOUR BILL ARE ARE IMPORTANT -- I APPRECIATE THE FACT TO THAT YOU -- WORKED HARD TO BE ABLE -- TO COME TO AGREEMENT WITH THE COMMITTEE ON AMENDMENTS -- YOU AND I SPOKE YESTERDAY ABOUT MY BECOMING A CO AUTHOR OF YOUR BILL HELP YOU'LL BECOME A UNLESS YOU ALREADY ARE A CO AUTHOR OF WHAT -- BUT I I'M HAPPY TO MOVE THIS FORWARD AND MAKE THE MOTION THANK.

SO WHAT'S HAPPENED IS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IMPLEMENTED TO THE STATE SYSTEM STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD HAVE BASICALLY COME UP WITH A METHOD. TO FIND GOVERNMENTS AND AND IN THE LA COUNTY WHERE I COME FROM WE PASSED A BIG MEASURE THAT REQUIRES A CLEAN UP BEFORE THE DISCHARGE. I WANTED TO CAPTURE THAT WATER AND REUSE IT THAT'S FOR ANOTHER CHAPTER IN ANOTHER DAY. BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO DO HERE SO HOW DO WE ENFORCE THAT HERE'S THE PROBLEM. THAT SO MANY COMPANIES WHO ARE REQUIRED TO GET THESE PERMITS FOR DISH CHARGE DON'T DO IT. SO HOW DOYOU COME UP WITH A CREATIVE WAY THAT REQUIRES THEM TO DO SO AND IT'S PARTICULARLY EGREGIOUS BECAUSE IF A BUNCH OF COMPANIES ARE POLLUTING. E. THEY THEY GO OUT THEY POLLUTE BUT THE BURDEN IF IT FALLS IN ALL THE COMPLIANCE COMPANIES SO HOW DO YOU CREATE EQUITY AND FAIRNESS FOR BUSINESSES HOW DO YOU REDUCE LIABILITIES FOR CITIES AND COUNTIES. AND WHAT WE DID IS WE SAID WHEN YOU GO OUT THE CITY OR COUNTY THAT HAS. THAT HAS A BUSINESS PERMIT IF IT DOES NOT REQUIRE ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS WHICH IS ONE OF THOSE. WE JUST BASICALLY GO AND WE SAY LOOK WHEN YOU DO YOUR PERMIT YOU GOTTA GO LOOK IT UP ON TO THE WEBSITE AND MAKE SURE THAT THE PEOPLE HAVE A PERMIT. IT WHEN THEY'RE GETTING A BUSINESS LICENSE IT'S A PRETTY SIMPLE THING A GOOD THE BENEFIT TO THE CITY YOU KNOW AND PEOPLE COMPLAIN AND BELLY ACHE ABOUT THAT THE COSTS. BUT IT'S A PRETTY IN BALANCING THE COST TO THE CITY BY ALL THIS POLLUTION THAT THAT THE HARM TO THEIR THE COMMUNITY THAT MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY OF OF THE BUSINESSES THAT ACTUALLY COMPLY. IS A PRETTY. ELEGANT SOLUTION IN MY JUDGMENT TO BE ABLE TO CREATE MORE COMPLIANCE REDUCE REST EVERYBODY ELSE AND CLEAN UP OUR OUR WATERWAYS AND STORM WATER RUNOFF THAT'S WHY REDUCE THE BILL THAT'S WHY I'M HERE TODAY. AND ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE THANK YOU RICH SENATOR -- OTHERS IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME SEAN BOTHWELL IN THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIA BECAUSE KEEPER LANCE -- I WANT TO START WITH JUST A CLICK MAKING CLARIFICATION OF THE INTENT OF THIS BILL BECAUSE THERE HAS BEEN CONFUSION IN THE PAST. SB TWO OH FIVE DOES NOT REQUIRE IN ANY WAY THE MUNICIPALITY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THAT THE THE INDUSTRIAL FACILITIES UNDER THE STORMWATER PERMIT. THAT THEY'RE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE PERMIT AS A WHOLE THAT MEANS THEY DON'T NEED TO FIGURE OUT IF THEY'RE IN CHARGE OF THAT THEY MET WATER QUALITY STANDARDS THAT'S OF WATER BOARD -- FORTY THING TO DO THE INTENT OF THIS BILL IS THE ONLY ENSURE THAT INDUSTRIAL FACILITIES WITHIN THE MUNICIPALITY OR IN ROLLED UNDER THIS INDUSTRIAL GENERAL PERMIT. AND REALLY AS THE SUMMER DESCRIBED. ALL THAT REQUIRES IS -- PUT IT A FOUR DIGIT AS I SEE CODE ONTO AN APPLICATION WE'VE ALREADY WORK WITH THE STATE WATER BOARD TO HAVE A WEB PAGE THAT SAYS ALL THIS I SEE CODES THAT NEED. TO BE UNDER THIS PERMIT YOU MATCH UP THE THE THE FOUR DIGIT CODE AND IF THEY MATCH UP AND THEN THERE'S ADDITIONAL UP THE PAPERWORK TO JUST SHOW THAT YOU HAVE COMPLIED UNDER THE PERMIT. I'M IS SENATE SAID TO THIS. THIS BILL IS A REALLY ELEGANT SOLUTION -- TO HELPING MUNICIPALITIES WITH LIABILITY RELIEF AND AND ALL TRY TO EXPLAIN WHY IT'S A LITTLE TECHNICAL BUT INDUSTRIAL GENERAL PERMIT -- YOU HAVE THE SELF AND ROLL INTO YOUR NOT AUTOMATICALLY INTO THE PERMITS SOCIAL HERE I'M IN THE SECOND FROM THE REGULATED COMMUNITY A LOT OF FOLKS HAVE BUT IT'S REALLY ONLY ABOUT ONE OUT OF FOUR ONE OUT OF FIVE INDUSTRIAL PHILLIES. SPECIALTIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE HOW IN THE WORLD THAT'S ABOUT ARE UNDER THIS PERMIT. SO WHAT HAPPENS SPLIT LET'S TAKE LOS ANGELES FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S A LOT OF INDUSTRIAL FACILITIES THERE -- IT TOOK THE LA RIVER ID LET'S SAY THE LA RIVERS IN IMPAIRED OR IS TO TOXIC TO BE ABLE TO SWIM IN WITH THE REGIONAL BOARD DOES THERE IS THEY LOOK AT HOW MUCH. HOW MUCH METALS CAN BE DISCHARGED INTO THAT RIVER? OUR WITHOUT MAKING IT TALKS. AND THE TAKE THAT NUMBER IN THE DIVIDED AMONG ALL THE PROPERTIES BUT IF 80% OF THE FOLKS THE DESTRUCTION METALS INTO THE RIVER ARE NOT A PERMITS HE THEN THAT THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT THIS PROGRAM EXIST AND INSTEAD THE MUNICIPALITIES IN LA -- LA COUNTY AND THE INDUSTRIAL FOLKS THEIR LEFT ARM ON THE HOOK TO PAY AND DO ALL THE IMPROVEMENTS NECESSARY TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE BUT THEY'LL NEVER ACTUALLY REACH THAT TARGET BECAUSE AGAIN 80% OR EVEN UNDER THE PERMIT. SO THIS IS GOOD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT IT'S GOOD FOR THE REGULATED COMMUNITY TO PROVIDE AN EVEN LATE LATE LEVEL PLAYING FIELD -- AND IT'S GOOD TO THE MUNICIPALITY TO REALLY DOES HELP WITH THEIR LIABILITY RELIEF UNDER STORM WATER FOR THAT ANSWER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WELCOME GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR LAURIE CAMERA REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA METALS COALITION -- CMC IS HOME TO ABOUT -- FOUR THOUSAND METAL MANUFACTURES IN CALIFORNIA WHO CREATE APPROXIMATELY THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND JOBS -- WE ARE PART OF THAT 20% WE ARE THE SMALL BUSINESSES THEY'VE THE FAMILY OWNED BUSINESSES THE METAL FOUNDRIES WHO -- PAY THE SEVENTEEN HUNDRED DOLLAR FEE ON AVERAGE -- WE NEED TO BRING INTO COMPLIANCE THAT OTHER 80% -- SO THAT WE'RE NOT AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE FOR THOSE READ FOR THESE REASONS WE OUR RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT. I FELT PLEASE. YEAH MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS GAVIN THE QUEUE ON BEHALF OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OUT OF DISTILLERS. ASSOCIATION WITH THE GREAT THINGS ABOUT THIS BILL IS THAT IT SAID OPPORTUNITY FOR THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY TO WORK TOGETHER ON A BILL THAT'S BOTH GOOD REALLY GOOD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT BUT ALSO GOOD FOR BUSINESS. I THINK FOR THOSE REASONS OF IT'S A GOOD BILL WHICH IS SUPPORTED THANK YOU. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS THEIR CALL HIM AFTER THE CALIFORNIA CITIES ALSO ASKED -- TO REPRESENT CALIFORNIA OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES WITH THE AMENDMENTS WERE HAPPY TO REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION WE REALLY DO APPRECIATE WORKING WITH -- THE COMMITTEE AND WITH THE SENATOR AND HIS STAFF ON THIS BILL AND THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR HARD WORK ON THE ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. IS THERE A MOTION [inaudible] SECOND. WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND. WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE A CLOSING STATEMENT SENATOR GOOD THANK YOU SO MUCH LIKE THE CONSIDERATION WALK. THE MOTION IS DO PASS AS AMENDED AMENDED AND RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS AGUIAR-CURRY LACKEY. BLOOM AYE BLOOM AYE BURNER HERVE RAMOS. RAMOS SIDE GONZALEZ ROBERT RIVAS VOEPEL. AYE VOEPEL AYE. THANK YOU SO MUCH. MEASURE NEEDS TO MORE VOTES WILL HOLD THAT OPEN. I SEE SENATOR CABALLERO. SIR ARE YOU GETTING THE THIRD STRING UP HERE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER LACKEY -- GETS BACK HE'LL WILL STEP IN NO PROBLEM. WHENEVER YOU'RE READY THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- MISTER CHAIRMAN. AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. AS YOU KNOW THE LEGISLATURE HAS RECOGNIZED THE NEED FOR FUNDS AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO HELP ALL CALIFORNIANS. ACCESS SAFE AND RELIABLE TO DRINKING WATER THIS IS A NEW ISSUE THAT I'M DEEPLY PASSIONATE ABOUT. SB EIGHT FOUR ONE FOUR MAKES IMMEDIATE AND LASTING GOVERNANCE REFORM TOO MANY OF THE NEARLY THREE HUNDRED WATER SYSTEM SAY STATEWIDE. THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD HAS IDENTIFIED -- CHRONICALLY FAILED TO SERVE SAFE DRINKING WATER GENERALLY THE SYSTEMS LACK THE FINANCIAL MANAGERIAL AND TECHNICAL RESOURCES NECESSARY TO ADDRESS ONGOING CONTAMINATION. AND INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUES NECESSARY TO OPERATE HIGH FUNCTIONING WATER SYSTEMS. THE VAST MAJORITY OF THESE SYSTEMS ARE SMALL RURAL. RURAL SYSTEM SERVING DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND ISOLATED COMMUNITIES WITH NO WITH NO LARGER SYSTEM NEARBY. A SUSTAINABLE SOLUTION IS NEEDED TO ADDRESS AS ONGOING HEALTH AND SAFETY CRISIS WHILE LAWS HAVE BEEN PASSED THAT ADDRESS VARIOUS ELEMENTS OF THE WATER ACCESSIBILITY ISSUE IMMEDIATE AND LASTING CHANGES ARE NEEDED TO ADDRESS THE UNDERLYING ISSUES OF THE FAILING SYSTEMS. SB FOUR ONE FOUR CREATES A MECHANISM TO MERGE THE SMALL NON COMPLIANT WATER SYSTEMS INTO LARGER MORE ROBUST PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS THAT CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IMPROVED ECONOMIES OF SCALE. STREAM STREAMLINED MANAGERIAL FUNCTIONS ENHANCED FINANCIAL CAPACITY AND ROBUST PUBLIC PARTICIPATION. THIS BILL COMPLIMENTS EXISTING STATE BOARD CONSOLIDATION AUTHORITY. INCLUDING THOSE IMPLEMENTED TO RATHER BILLS AS WELL AS EFFORTS CONTEMPLATED BY THE LEGISLATURE IN SB TWO HUNDRED AND THROUGHOUT THE BROUGHT THE BUDGET PROCESS IT ESTABLISHES NEW AUTHORITY FOR THE WATER BOARD. AND A POWERFUL TOOL. SB FOUR ONE FOUR ALSO INCORPORATES A ROBUST LAUGH CO PROCESS TO ENSURE NOTICE PUBLIC HEARINGS TRANSPARENCY AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT. SOME OF ARGUED THAT THIS PROCESS IS CUMBERSOME. BUT IT IS ESSENTIAL TO ALLOWING RESIDENTS IN MY RURAL UNDERSERVED AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THE OPPORTUNITIES TO PARTICIPATE. TO COMMENT AND HAVE VOTING POWER IN THE NEWLY CREATED SYSTEMS TO ENSURE THE LONG TERM SUSTAINABILITY OF THE NEW SYSTEMS. WITH ME TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY TODAY ARE DANIEL COATS OF EASTERN MUNICIPAL WATER DISTRICT AND DANIEL BLANCHETTE OF THE CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL UTILITIES ASSOCIATION BILL SPONSORED. THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M DANIEL COATS WITH EASTERN MUNICIPAL WATER DISTRICT OF WATER WASTEWATER AND RECYCLED WATER COMMITTEE. ITER TO OVER EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND RESIDENTS IN WESTERN RIVERSIDE COUNTY. EASTERN IS PLEASED AND SUPPORTIVE OF THE INCREDIBLE PROGRESS MADE BY THE LEGISLATURE IN THE ADMINISTRATION TOWARDS ESTABLISHING A LONG TERM FUNDING SOLUTION. AND FUNDING IMPLEMENTATION PLAN TO ENSURE ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCESS TO SAFE AND RELIABLE DRINKING WATER. WELL THESE SOLUTIONS OFFER REMARKABLE PROGRESS WE BELIEVE THERE IS AN ADDITIONAL ELEMENT THAT IS NEEDED UNDER THROUGH GOVERNANCE REFORM. THAT WOULD ENSURE THERE IS A FULL PORTFOLIO OF SOLUTIONS AVAILABLE TO ENSURE THAT SUSTAINABLE AND RELIABLE WATER SERVICES PROVIDED IN AN EXPEDITED AND COST EFFECTIVE MANNER. IN DEVELOPING AS BEFORE FOURTEEN WE HAVE MET WITH AND CONSIDERED AND PUT FROM A VERY FROM A VARIETY OF STAKE HOLDERS INCLUDING EXPERT. FROM MUTUAL AND PRIVATE WATER COMPANIES LAUGHTER REPRESENTATIVES PUBLIC WATERS PROVIDERS ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ADVOCATES HOWARD JARVIS AND THE STATE BOARD AMONG AND OTHERS. THE RESULT IS LEGISLATION THAT NOT ONLY FACILITATES REGIONALIZATION OF FAILING WATER SYSTEMS THROUGH THE FORMATION OF A SMALL SYSTEM WATER AUTHORITY. THAT IMPLEMENTS NEEDED GOVERNANCE REFORMS THROUGH A LOCAL TRANSPARENT LASKO PROCESS THAT ENSURES LOCALS INTERESTS AND COMMUNITY NEEDS ARE APPROPRIATELY CONSIDERED AND THE BEST PATH TO MEET THE COMMUNITIES WATER QUALITY NEEDS ARE. ARE ADEQUATELY ASSESSED. CONDITIONALLY FORMATION WITH FORTY BENEFITS FROM ENHANCE STATE AND LOCAL OVERSIGHT ARGUABLY MORE SO THAN ANY OTHER AVENUE FOR CONSOLIDATION. TO ENSURE THAT LONG TERM FINANCIAL OPERATIONAL VIABILITY OF AND HIGHER QUALITY WATER IS DELIVERED. THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH STATE BOARD MEETINGS AND OVERSIGHT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL BUT THE LOCAL LASKO AND ANNUAL REPORTING AT THE LOCAL LASKO PUBLIC HEARINGS THROUGH THE LAST GO PROCESS. ULTIMATELY THIS EFFORT TRANSITIONS THE LOCAL MUNICIPAL SERVICE REVIEW PROCESS ADDITIONALLY FOLLOWING THE FORMATION THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE IS REQUIRED PERFORMANCE FISCAL AN OPERATIONAL HEALTH ASSESSMENT. OF EACH AUTHORITY. AND THE STATE BOARD IS REQUIRED TO SUBMIT A REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE ON THE CONSOLIDATIONS THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE AND ANY OUTSTANDING REPORTED DRINKING WATER QUALITY ISSUES. AS LOCAL PUBLIC AGENCIES THESE ENTITIES WILL ALSO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR A VARIETY OF TRANSPARENCY REQUIREMENTS AND REPORTING TO STATE AND LOCAL ENTITIES. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS TRANSLATES INTO A BILL THAT WILL ULTIMATELY AND SURE THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES WILL RECEIVE PERMANENT ACCESS TO SAFE AND RELIABLE DRINKING WATER AND FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST DRIVE OUT. I THINK YOU TURN MEMBERS MY NAME IS DANIEL BLASTED WITH CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL UTILITIES ASSOCIATION WE ARE PROUD TO BE CO SPONSORS AND SUPPORTERS OF SB. FOUR FOURTEEN ON THE LEGISLATURE'S ACTED ON FINDING A POLICY PROPOSALS THAT RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF CONSOLIDATION AS A TOOL TO ENSURE SAFE DRINKING WATER FOR MANY COMMUNITIES. SB FOUR FOURTEEN SIX TO BRIDGE AN IMPORTANT GAP IN THE STATE'S CURRENT CONSOLIDATION AUTHORITY RIGHT NOW THE STATE MUST RELY ON A RECEIVING AGENCY TO MERGE WITH THE SYSTEM THAT IS CONSISTENTLY FAILING TO PROVIDE SAFE DRINKING WATER. WHICH CAN BE A CHALLENGE FOR VARIETY OF REASONS THE PROCESS AND AS WE FOR FOURTEEN WOULD INSTEAD ALLOW CHRONICALLY NON COMPLIANT WATER SYSTEMS TO MERGE AND BECOME A FUNCTIONAL MORE ROBUST SYSTEM. AS A RESULT OF THE BENEFITS OUTLINED BY THE AUTHORED OR CO SPONSOR THIS PROCESS OUTLINED IN SB FOUR FOURTEEN IS COMPLEMENTARY TO EXISTING AUTHORITIES RATHER THAN DUPLICATING OR SUPERSEDING. EXISTING PROCESSES IF THE STATE BOARD FINDS OF THE CREATION OF A SMALL SYSTEM WATER THIRTY IS THE MOST APPROPRIATE SOLUTION THE SUBSEQUENT PROCESS IS A COULD LOCALLY CONTROLLED AND TRANSPARENT WHICH WE BELIEVE IS ESSENTIAL TO LONG LASTING GOOD GOVERNANCE. WE BELIEVE THE CUSTOMERS CAN AND SHOULD FULLY PARTICIPATE IN DECISIONS RELATED TO THE FUTURE OF THEIR WATER SUPPLY AND IN THIS SCENARIO CUSTOMERS OF EXISTING SYSTEMS WOULD HAVE MORE OF A VOICE. THAN TRADITIONAL CONSOLIDATIONS BECAUSE THE BILL REQUIRES THAT THE INITIAL BOARD OF DIRECTORS INCLUDED REPRESENTATIVES FROM EVERY WATER SYSTEM THAT JUST MERGED INTO THE NEW AUTHORITY. THIS TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX ALSO WILL COMPLEMENT NOT CONFLICT WITH THE PLAN AND ACTIVITIES OUTLINED IN SB TWO HUNDRED AND CAN EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS THE SYSTEMS THAT ARE NOT CLOSE ENOUGH TO ANOTHER SYSTEM. TO ANOTHER LARGER SYSTEM TO TO MERGE SB FOUR FOURTEEN WILL NOT DELAY EXISTING CONSOLIDATIONS IT WILL NOT CREATE ORPHANS SYSTEMS OR DIVERT RESOURCES FROM OTHER SOLUTIONS BECAUSE THE WATER BOARD IS TRULY IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT. I WANT SELECT THE OPTION THAT IS MOST APPROPRIATE FOR THE SITUATION THE TIME IS NOW TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES FACING OUR STATE WE APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK THE LEGISLATURE HAS PUT INTO THIS ISSUE. AND WE BELIEVE SB FOUR FOURTEEN PROVIDE SUSTAINABLE PATH FORWARD TO HELP ACHIEVE THIS GOAL AND WE URGE YOUR AYE VOTE.

WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION WE GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU CAN BE SEEN WITH LEADERSHIP COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY -- WE SHARE -- THAT THAT AUTHORS AND THE SPONSORS CAN DESIRE TO SEE TO ADDRESS. SOME OF THAT CAN INTRACTABLE OBSTACLES IN SMALL COMMUNITIES IN THERE CAN EFFORTS TO SECURE SAFE AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER -- ISN'T AS I'M SURE MANY OF YOU KNOW I THINK OUR BIGGEST CONCERN ARE THE WHERE WERE WE THE REASONS THAT UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO SUPPORT THIS BILL. IS THAT WE THINK THAT THE STATE BOARD CURRENTLY HAS -- THE TOOLS AND ASSETS IN PLACE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ADDRESSING THE SMALL SYSTEMS THROUGH KIND OF A COMBINATION OF CONSOLIDATION AUTHORITY. BUT ALL TO THE ADMINISTRATOR AUTHORITY WHICH SB TWO HUNDRED IMPROVED UPON -- THAT CAN USE THAT THAT THAT THAT WERE AND IT WERE BY AN ADMINISTRATOR CAN WORK WITH A GROUP THING A SERIES OF SYSTEMS -- AND MANAGE THEM BRING THEM TOGETHER WE DO -- SEE POTENTIALLY A ROLE FOR REGIONAL AUTHORITY -- CA AS THIS BILL ENVISIONS RECEIVED IS A FAR DIFFERENT PATH AND WHAT WE ARE HOPEFUL FOR IS THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THAT WITH THE SPONSORS WITH THE AUTHORED WITH OTHER STAKEHOLDERS. TO TO ACTUALLY DETERMINE WHAT THAT CORRECT PATH IS TO CREATE A STRONG SUSTAINABLE WATER SYSTEMS OF ARE GOING. TO BECOME A KEY KEY ISSUES KEY CONCERNS WITH THIS IS THE FAIRLY CUMBERSOME AND PROCESS. THAT THEY STATED THE THAT PRESENTATION DISCUSSED ARE CONCERNED THAT THIS IS CUMBERSOME AND CAN CREATE NOT JUST A HUGE AMOUNT OF COST ON THE PART OF THE STATE -- BUT ALSO A HUGE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF DELAY FOR COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN FIGHTING FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS FOR SAFE DRINKING WATER -- AND IN THE END OF THIS PROCESS COULD BE. IN THE END AND UNSUCCESSFUL AFTER DELAY AFTER SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY ANOTHER GOING TO ISSUES ON TO RAISE REAL QUICKLY IS THAT IMPORTANT WE SHARE. A COMMITMENT TO PUBLIC PROCESS IN THE IMPORTANCE OF COMMUNITY MEMBERS HAVING A SAY IN THE FATE OF THEIR WATER SYSTEM IN THE WATER DELIVERY -- WE ARE WE HAVE WORKED VERY VERY HARD WITH LEGISLATION OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE STATE'S TOOLS INCLUDE AND INCORPORATE A VERY STRONG PUBLIC PROCESS. THAT MAKE SURE IS THAT MAKES SURE THAT COMMUNITY RESIDENTS IMPACTED BY UNSAFE DRINKING WATER AND WORKING TOWARDS A DRINKING WATER SOLUTION CAN TAKE PART IN THE PROCESS -- THROUGH THE CONSOLIDATION AUTHORITY THE ADMINISTRATOR AUTHORITY OR THROUGH OTHER TOOLS AND MEANS. THANKS SO MUCH. THANK YOU. WELCOME. THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS JONATHAN NELSON WITH THE COMMUNITY WATER CENTER WANT TO START JUST BY SAYING THANK YOU TO THE SENATOR FOR SUPPORT OF SB.

I JUST BRIEFLY WANT TO ECHO THE COMMENTS MADE BY A LEADERSHIP COUNCIL GIVEN THE PASSAGE OF THIS SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER FIND RATHER THAN PROCEED -- WITH THE FRAMER PROPOSED IN THIS LEGISLATION. WE WOULD PREFER TO WORK WITH THE STATE WATER BOARD TO IN PARTNERSHIP WITH PUBLIC STAKEHOLDERS HAVE THE BOARD IDENTIFY WHAT CHANGES ADDITIONAL CHANGES OR MODIFICATIONS MAY BE NEEDED TO EFFECTUATE CONSOLIDATIONS. AT BOTH THE LOCAL AND REGIONAL LEVEL -- AND WE WOULD LOOK FORWARD TO PARTICIPATING IN THAT PROCESS THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE THERE OTHERS IN OPPOSITION [inaudible] GOOD AFTERNOON. AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS TELETRACK NUMBER HALF THE WATER FOUNDATION MUSIC TO ECHO THE SAME CONCERNS ARE COLLEAGUES IN OPPOSITION [inaudible] THANK YOU. MANY OTHERS IN OPPOSITION SAYING NONE. OF ANY QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE. OKAY WE HAVE A MOTION -- WE DO HAVE A QUESTION FROM ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOM -- MOSTLY A COMMENT I ALSO IS GOING TO GIVE A SHOUT OUT TO A SENATOR MINING THIS HAS BEEN A PRETTY EXTRAORDINARY -- OF OF A FEW DAYS SO ON ON AN ISSUE THAT HAS REALLY. ODD AND ONE OF THE MORE INTRACTABLE ISSUES AT AND AN IMPORTANT ISSUES -- THAT THAT WENT ON RESULTS FOR FOR SEVERAL YEARS SO WE'RE WE'RE IN A GOOD PLACE NOW WHERE -- AGREE OR DISAGREE WITH THE FUNDING SOURCE WE'VE GOT A FUNDING SOURCE IS GOING TO GENERATE A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR -- ROUGHLY AND AND SO I THINK IT'S WE FIND OURSELVES IN A VERY ENVIABLE PLACE AND NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. FIVE THE THE IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS AND HOW WE GO ABOUT DOING THAT -- I'M GONNA BE A SUPPORTING THE THIS BILL TODAY I DO WANT -- TO A CALL OUT THE THE FACT THAT -- AB ONE THIRTY FOUR ALSO DEALS WITH THE WITH SOME OF THESE ISSUES IN A PERFECT WORLD -- WE WOULD BE HAVING A CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW TO MOVE BOTH OF THESE VEHICLES FORWARD IN A IN A WAY THAT -- COMPLIMENTED ONE ANOTHER UNFORTUNATELY MINDS ON A TWO YEAR TRACK NOW SO THINGS ARE A LITTLE BIT DISCOMBOBULATED AND AND I REALLY HOPE THAT WERE -- AND CERTAINLY NOT OF BY ANY -- EFFORTS OF YOUR SENATOR BUT I HOPE THAT WE DON'T ALL GET BOGGED DOWN -- IN A WAY THAT MAKES IT TO THE THAT STRETCHES OUT PERIOD OF TIME WITHIN WHICH A IMPLEMENTATION REALLY HAPPENS AND AND GEARS UP AND AND AND AND MOVES FORWARD BECAUSE THIS ISSUES ALREADY WAITED TOO LONG. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY OTHER COMMENTS TO THE COMMITTEE. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND I I WON A SECOND YOUR COMMENT THAT THIS IS. BEEN TO IT'S BEEN IN IN THE WINGS WAY TOO LONG -- I THINK THAT THAT THE CHALLENGE WITH ME WITH THE OPPOSITION IS THAT FRANKLY THERE HAS BEEN NO PROPOSAL THAT SAYS THIS IS A BETTER WAY TO DO IT -- NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO IS -- THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT I'VE WORKED ON THIS I WORKED ON THIS WHEN I WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY. AND THE WHOLE PURPOSE IS TO I'M AND AND LET ME JUST START OFF BY SAYING IT. FOR ME TO BE GIVING MORE THIRTY TO THE WATER BOARD IS. IT IT'S IT'S UNIQUE. BECAUSE GENERALLY SPEAKING A LOT OF THE THINKS THE WATER BOARD DOES I GET I DON'T AGREE WITH BUT THERE IN THE IN THE PRIMARY POSITION TO BE ABLE TO SAY HERE ARE THE SYSTEMS. AND HERE'S THE DATA WE'VE RECEIVED FROM THEM IN REGARDS TO WHY WHY THEIR WATER IS NOT POTABLE AND AND SO THEY HAVE THIS ABILITY TO GO IN AND AND AND IDENTIFY THOSE AND SO WE'RE GIVING THEM THE AUTHORITY THROUGH THIS -- TO TO START A PROCESS THAT THEN INVOLVES LAUGH GO. ON AND AND LAUGH GOES IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE REGIONAL. THEY HAVE THE THE THE VIEW OF THE REGION AND WE GIVE THEM THE AUTHORITY TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT -- HOW LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WENT WILL INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER -- AND SO -- I'M I'M. WE'VE WORKED REALLY HARD AT TRYING TO STREAMLINE TO MAKE THIS A MUCH AS MUCH AS EFFICIENT AS POSSIBLE. AND IT IS A TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX THEY CAN USE IT OR NOT AT THEIR DISCRETION AND IF THERE'S A BETTER WAY TO GET TO YES QUITE FRANKLY I'D LIKE TO SEE THEM GET TO YES. IN A BETTER WAY BUT WE NEED TO GIVE THEM THE TOOLS TO BE ABLE TO LOOK AT CREATING J. P. A.'S ACROSS THE REGION THAT HAVE. THE ABILITY TO REALLY START CLEANING UP THE SMALL WATER SYSTEM SO -- I REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY PERCENT THIS BILL HERE TODAY AND I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR AS YOU KNOW FROM COMING FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT ANY TOOL THAT WE CAN HELP A COMMUNITY MOVE FORWARD -- THE TOOLBOX IS PRETTY IMPORTANT SOMETIMES IT WAS DRAINED AND NOW WE GOT A PHILLIP BACK UP RIGHT.

REFINING AND IMPROVING SB -- ONE EIGHTY NINE SINCE ITS ESTABLISHMENT IN NINETEEN SEVENTEEN THE FORT ORD MILITARY BASE HAS BEEN AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE MONTEREY BAY REGIONS ECONOMY. WHEN THE BASE CLOSED IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR THE STATE LEGISLATURE ESTABLISHED THE FORWARD REDUCE A THORNY KNOWN AS FOR A? TO CARRY OUT THE PLANNING FINANCING AND MANAGEMENT OF THE FORMER FORT ORD FACILITY AS DESCRIBED IN THE NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN RE USE PLAN. DUE TO AN ECONOMIC RECESSION FOR STRUGGLE TO EXECUTE THE BASE REDUCE PLAN. IN TWENTY TWELVE THE LEGISLATURE PASSED ASSEMBLY BILL SIXTEEN FOURTEEN WHICH EXTENDED THE SUNSET DATE FOR FOR A FROM JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY FOURTEEN TO JUNE THIRTIETH. TWENTY TWENTY THE BILL ALSO REQUIRED FOR TO DEVELOP THE TRANSITION PLAN TO FULFILL ALL OUTSTANDING OBLIGATIONS. THE FOUR BOARD HAS APPROVED A TRANSITION PLAN IN IS CURRENTLY NEGOTIATING IMPLEMENTING AGREEMENTS FOR WATER AUGMENTATION TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE ENVIRONMENTAL RESTORATION. CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS LOCAL FUNDING MECHANISMS TO SUPPORT THESE ACTIVITIES AND UNEXPLODED ORDINANCE REMOVAL. FOREIGN NEEDS TO ADDITIONAL YEARS TO ALLOW LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO IMPLEMENT ADEQUATE FUNDING MECHANISMS TO SUPPORT PROJECTS IDENTIFIED IN THE FOR A TRANSITION PLAN. AS WELL AS TO ENSURE CONTRACTS THAT CONTRACTS ARE ESTABLISHED FOR ALL TRANSITION PLAN IMPLEMENTING AGREEMENTS. SB ONE EIGHTY NINE NARROWS THE JURISDICTIONAL OVERSIGHT OF THE FOUR OH BOARD AS WELL AS REDUCES THE NUMBER OF BOARD MEMBERS FROM. THIRTEEN TO FIVE THE BOARD THE FOR A TRANSITION PLAN UNTIL JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY TWO WHEN THE BOARD WILL SUNSET. UNDER THIS BILL PROPOSAL. THIS BILL ENSURES THAT THE COMMUNITIES IMPACTED BY THE REDEVELOPMENT OF FOR A HAVE ADEQUATE FUNDING MECHANISMS TO ACHIEVE THE REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT THAT WAS PROMISED WHEN THE AUTHORITY WAS ESTABLISHED. WE'RE WORKING HARD TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PATH FORWARD BENEFITS THE MONTEREY BAY REGION AS A WHOLE AND IS CONSISTENT WITH THE OBJECTIVES OF THE BASE REDUCE PLAN. APPROPRIATE TIME I RESPECTFULLY SECURE AYE VOTE TODAY IN THROUGH THE CHAIR WOULD LIKE 2% WITNESSES IN SUPPORT STARTING WITH PRESIDENT EDUARDO A CHIRLA PRESIDENT OF CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY AT MONTEREY BAY. WELCOME MISTER PRESIDENT OF CHIRLA. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF SB ONE EIGHTY NINE CENTER MONIES BILL TO EXTEND THE AUTHORIZATION. FOR THE FOUR DOOR REVIEWS OF THORNY. I BELIEVE THIS BILL IS IN THE BEST INTERESTS OR UNIVERSITY IN OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE SERVE. AS MOST OF YOU KNOW CAST A MONTEREY BAY HAS A UNIQUE HISTORY FOUNDER A PORTION OF THE SITE OF THE HISTORIC FORT ORD. WERE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF OUR TROOPS WERE TRAINED FOR MUCH OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY. CSU NB WAS THE RESULT OF AN INTENSE COMMUNITY WIDE EFFORT BOTH TO MITIGATE THE ECONOMIC EFFECTS OF THE BASE CLOSURE. AND TO PROVIDE INCREASED EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES TO PEOPLE IN OUR REGION AND OUR STATE. WHEN I CAME TO THE CAMPUS AS PRESIDENT IN? TWO THOUSAND TWELVE ASSOCIATION BEES ONGOING RELATIONSHIP WAS COMMUNITIES AS ONE OF THE UNIVERSITIES GREAT ASSETS. I'M A STRONG BELIEVER IN THE CONCEPT OF STEWART OF PLACE. THE IDEA THAT PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO BE ACTIVELY INVOLVED THEIR COMMUNITIES TO HELP THEM ADVANCE THE ONLY EDUCATIONALLY BUT ALSO SOCIALLY CULTURALLY AND ECONOMICALLY. SYSTEM BE CANNON HAS ACTED AS A CONVENER AND THOUGHT LEADER IN HELPING THE MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDERS IN THE REGION CHARTER FUTURE FUTURE DIRECTION ALONG THESE DIMENSIONS. AS A CUSTODIAN OF THE FOR ARGUES PLANNED FOR A HAS BEEN A KEY AGENCY AND HELPING FACILITATE THOSE CONVERSATIONS. BEYOND ITS UNIQUE FUNDED HISTORY CSU IN BE IS AN UNUSUAL CAMPUS AND OTHER ASPECTS OF WELL. WE DO NOT EXIST WITHIN A TRADITIONAL COLLEGE TOWN. WE SIT ASTRIDE THE CITY LIMITS OF CAESAR MARINO. AND ARE BOUNDED BY LAND GOVERNED BY A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS. ALSO UNLIKE MANY OTHER CAMPUSES IN THIS ISSUE SYSTEM WE HAVE ROOM TO GROW OUR AND ROMAN SUBSTANTIALLY. TO HELP OUR STATE MEET IS WELL DOCUMENTED NEED FROM COLLEGE GRADUATES. THAT GROWTH WILL REQUIRE BOTH A THOROUGH UNDERSTANDING OF ITS IMPACT ON NATURAL RESOURCES AND TRAFFIC. AND A SHARED STRATEGY AMONG SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES ON HOW BEST TO MEET THE NEEDS OF A GROWING COLLEGE CAMPUS. AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES IT PRESENTS FOR ALL OF THEM. AS PRESIDENT I HAVE TAKEN A PERSONAL ROLE AND WORKING DIRECTLY WITH FOR A AN AGENCY THAT I SEE AS INSTRUMENTAL IN FORGING THOSE CONNECTIONS. IN MY EXPERIENCE FOR HAS BEEN EFFECTIVE IN PROMOTING THE CONSTRUCTION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHICH IS VITAL BOTH TO SEIZE HIM BE AND THE LARGER COMMUNITY. IT DOESN'T GET ASIAN IMPORTANT ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICATIONS OF HELPS PROTECT THE MONTEREY BAY. IT HAS HELPED FINISH REMOVAL OF UNEXPLODED MUNITIONS A MORE THAN THREE THOUSAND ACRES OF THE FORMER ARMY BASE. AND HAS HELPED SPEARHEAD EFFORTS TO REMOVE DILAPIDATED ARMY STRUCTURES THAT WE'RE BOTH AN EYESORE AND POTENTIAL SAFETY HAZARDS. AND IT HAS DEVELOPED A TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE WITHIN THE FORMER FORT ORD NEEDED FOR PLANNED DEVELOPMENT. WELL FOR HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN MANY ASPECTS OF MANAGING THESE TRANSITIONS IS WORK IS NOT FINISHED. OUR REGION CONTINUES TO SEEK WAYS TO GENERATE FINANCING FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION INFRASTRUCTURE AND OTHER CROSS BOUNDARY CAPITAL NEEDS. THE NEED TO DEVELOP AFFORDABLE HOUSING REMAINS IMMENSE. HABITAT PROTECTION A WELFARE MITIGATION OR ONGOING CONCERNS. AND FUTURE CAMPUS GROWTH WILL REQUIRE US TO FULLY ADDRESS TRANSIT INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS ON A CORE NAY BASIS AS ENVISIONED IN THE FORT ORD REUSE PLAN. I BELIEVE FOR REMAINS AN EXCELLENT FORUM FOR THOSE DISCUSSIONS AMONG REPRESENTATIVES OF VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS. I WAS PLEASED TO SEE THE MARIE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AGREED IN PASSING A RESOLUTION SUPPORTING FOR HIS EXTENSION. DURING THE 200-019-2000 TWENTY ACADEMIC YEAR CAL STATE MONTEREY BAY WILL CELEBRATE. OUR TWENTY FIFTH ANNIVERSARY. WE HAVE COME A LONG WAY. WE HAVE MUCH POTENTIAL STILL TO BE FULFILLED. I SEE THE EXTENSION OF THE FORD OR REUSE OF THOR IS AN IMPORTANT ASSET IN THAT EFFORT. AND I GREATLY APPRECIATE THE COLLABORATIVE APPROACH THE CEREMONY AND HIS STAFF HAVE TAKEN IN CRAFTING THIS BILL TO MEET THE DIVERSE NEEDS OF STAKEHOLDERS IN OUR REGION. THANK YOU.

AND LAUNCHING A NEW REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY FOCUSED ON DRONES AUTOMATION AND ROBOTICS TECHNOLOGIES. NEVER LET THE LESS EVEN WITH ALL THE PROGRESS TO DATE THERE STILL REMAINS CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION CONSERVATION WORK YET TO BE COMPLETED.

EXISTENCE OF 475% OF THE LAND TO BE DEVELOPED IS HE IN OUR TO COMMUNITIES IT'S NOT IN THE COUNTY IT'S NOT IN. HOW ALL THESE ADJACENT AREAS IT'S IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND WE LIVE WITH THE DAY TO DAY? TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO FOR WAS A GREAT IDEA HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WERE PLANNED. TO BE GENERATED FOR THESE MASSIVE ROAD PROJECTS MASSIVE HABITAT CONSERVATION PROJECT MASSIVE WATER INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT HUGE SINGLE FAMILY HOME SAID TURN. THE CLOSURE FORD OF THE FORMER FORWARD INTO THE JEWEL OF MONTEREY PENINSULA TWENTY FIVE YEARS LATER. IT'S CLEAR THE PLAN IS DEEPLY FLAWED IN THE PICTURES SHOW WAY IS DEEPLY FLAWED. THIS MASSIVE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM CAN NEVER BE FUNDED -- THE FUNDING WILL NEVER BE THERE UNTIL SO THE SOLUTION HAS ALWAYS BEEN IN TWENTY FOURTEEN LET'S KICK THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD LET'S EXTEND FOR AGAIN AND SO THE SOLUTION ONCE AGAIN. LET'S EXTEND FOR TWO MORE YEARS. WELL SB ONE EIGHTY NINE ELIMINATES MANY OF THE PROBLEM ELEMENTS OF THE BASE FOR USE PLAN. IF FOUR IS ALLOWED TO SUNSET IN TWENTY TWENTY ALL OF THE PROBLEMS WILL BE ELIMINATED AND THEY WILL GO AWAY AND READ IT AND SEE SIDE WILL HAVE THE TOOLS. TO DO THE REDEVELOPMENT THAT WE NEED TO DO. AS STATED THEIR OPPOSITION LETTER ALL THE REGIONAL AGENCIES ARE IN PLACE AND HAVE SAID THAT THEY'RE FULLY ABLE TICKLE THEIR REGIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES. TRANSPORTATION AGENCY MONTEREY COUNTY THEY CAN TAKE OVER THE ROAD TO ME IMMEDIATELY RATED COAST WATER DISTRICT THEY'LL TAKE OVER ALL THE WATER INFRASTRUCTURE SEE CITED SAID THEY'LL TAKE OVER ALL THE MUNITIONS REMOVAL LAUGH CO HAS SAID THEY ARE IN PLACE TWENTY TWENTY THEY'LL BE READY TO GO -- HABITAT WE NEED TO WORK OUT BUT WE DON'T NEED AN EXTENSION A TWO YEARS PRESS TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE WANNA FORMER JP OR SOME OTHER -- OR ORGANIZATION TO OVERSEE THE HABITAT EXTENDED FOR TWO MORE YEARS. SIMPLY EXTENDS THE FUNDING OF PRIORITIES OF CARMEL PACIFIC GROVE MONTEREY MONTEREY COUNTY DEL RIO OAKS THE WEALTHY COMMUNITIES OF THE AREA. AND THEY DIVERTED FROM THE PRIORITIES OF SEASIDE IMERINA. THAT THE PICTURES THAT YOU SHOW THEIR THERE'S SIX HUNDRED THIRTY THREE REMAIN IN BLIGHTED STRUCTURES FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT OF THOSE ARE IN OUR COMMUNITY THE SURROUND OUR HIGH SCHOOL. THE SURROUND OUR MAIN INTEREST FOR CITIES THE STRONGER PARKS THESE AROUND OUR NEIGHBORHOOD HOMES. THEY'RE FULL OF LEAD THEY'RE FULL OF ASBESTOS HOMELESS LIVE IN THEM. DOESN'T SEEM MATTER THE EFFECT OF HOMELESS PEOPLE ON THOSE ARE SCHOOL KIDS THEY PLAN THEM THEY TAKE DRUGS TO THEM THEY DO ALL SORTS OF THINGS THOSE HOMES. AND THERE'S NO PLAN FROM TO GO AWAY. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THE SITTER MARINA TOOK OUT AT THIRTY SIX MILLION DOLLAR INTEREST ONLY LOAN PURCHASE PRESTON PARK FROM FOR A AND LAND SO DOLLARS PARTY IS TO GO -- TO BLIGHT REMOVAL ED THAT THIRTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS. ZERO OF THE FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT HOMES IN MARINO RICK WERE REMOVED THIRTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS. ZERO HOMES REMOVED THAT SHOWS YOU WHERE THE PLAYER PRIORITY OF THE FOUR BOARD. IS GOING IT'S NOT INTO THE BIKE REMOVAL AND IT'S CERTAINLY NOT INTO. TO THE PARTIES OUR COMMUNITY OUR PRIORITIES ARE WE HAVE EXISTING ROADS AND INFRASTRUCTURE THERE ARE FALLING APART. WE HAVE PARKS WE HAVE EXISTING. STRUCTURES THAT NEED TO BE REHABILITATED. THEY GIVE THE EXAMPLE THERE'S A OLD POOL BUILDING FROM THE ARMY INDOOR POOL TWENTY FIVE YEARS OLD. VACANT FALLING APART. WE HAVE FEASIBILITY STUDIES TO RENOVATE THE BUILDING -- TURNED INTO AN AQUATIC CENTER THAT THE BOMB RIPPED PENINSULA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT CAN USE FOR COMPETITIVE SWIMMING. THE VETERANS TRANSITION CENTER OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES CAN USE. BUT THERE'S NO FUNDING IN A COUPLE YEARS THAT STRUCTURE WILL FALL AWAY WE HAVE AN EXISTING STRUCTURE IN EXISTING POOL. AT BUT THE MONEY'S NEVER COME TO PRODUCE LIKE THIS WE HAVE FOURTEEN ACRES A PARK RIGHT NEXT TO THAT. COVERED THE BLIGHTED HOMES. WE HAVE. A LOCAL GROUP THAT WANTS TO BUILD AN ALL INCLUSIVE PLAYGROUND WHICH IS A DISABLED PLAYGROUND THE LARGEST IN CALIFORNIA PROBABLY THE LARGEST IN THE WESTERN REGION. THEY WANT TO BUILD IT THERE IT'S A J. SENT TO THE POLE ADJACENT TO THE BEACH HI MOM. BUT WE HAVE THESE BLIGHTED HOMES WE HAVE NO ABILITY TO PUT. MONIES INTO THE PRIORITIES THE IMPORTANT TO OUR COMMUNITIES HOW WE HAVEN'T ARTS VILLAGE WE HAVE TWO QUARTER MILE LONG WAREHOUSES IN A MASON ARTS VILLAGE PLAN TO BRING IN ARTISTS FROM AROUND THE WORLD WE'VE TALKED WITH. A LOT OF PEOPLE GET MOVING FORWARD THOSE STRUCTURES IN A COUPLE YEARS WILL BE GONE IF WE DON'T DIVERT MILLION CENTER. REHABILITATING THEM AND SO REALLY WHAT IT GETS DOWN TO IS PRIORITIES. THE FOUR BOARD IN THE REGION HAS ITS PRIORITIES FOR THE REGIONAL ROADS IN THESE MASSIVE HABITAT PROJECTS. ON OUR COMMITTEES CONTINUE TO FAIL AND FALL APART OUR ROADS FALL APART. AND WE WOULD ASK THAT YOU NOT. SB ONE EIGHTY NINE IT REALLY OF TEXAS -- IF YOU ALLOW FOR TO SUNSET IN. TWENTY TWENTY I CAN GUARANTEE A YOU'LL SEE A TRANSFORMATION START KERR. IN OUR COMMUNITIES A MARINE IN SEASIDE WE WILL HAVE THE RESOURCES AND THE REVENUE AND THE FUNDS WILL RECONSTRUCT TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE. IN OUR POOR COMMUNITIES THAT WILL TRANSFORM THE REGION. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE THERE OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE OUR COMMENTS.

I KNOW WE'RE IN DISAGREEMENT WITH THE TO THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS A MARINE IN SEASIDE AS WAS POINTED OUT. ON BY THE WITNESS THE COUNCIL MEMBER FROM DEL REY OAKS THERE'S BEEN A LITTLE BIT OF A I WOULD SAY IN IMBALANCE IN HOUSE SOME OF THE DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES HAVE PROCEEDED. A LOT OF THE HOUSING HAS BEEN. BUILT IN MARINA -- HOTELS BUSINESS PARK IT CETERA OM WE HAVE A REGIONAL RESPONSIBILITY AND I WOULD REASSURE THE CITIES OF SEASIDE IMERINA. THAT THERE IS NOTHING IN SENATE BILL ONE EIGHTY NINE BEFORE YOU TODAY THAT PREVENTS THEM FROM MOVING FORWARD. ON THEIR OWN BREAKING TIES WITH FOR A ANNA. THEY SECURE THEIR FUNDING MECHANISMS THEY ARE FREE TO MOVE FORWARD -- AND PURSUE THEIR SELF DETERMINATION. AS A SENATOR REPRESENTING THE AREA AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER RIVAS KNOWS IN AS THE OTHERS WHO TESTIFIED IN FAVOR. THIS IS A REGIONAL RESOURCE AND SOME SAY WE CAN WALK AWAY FROM THIS TOMORROW. WE HAVEN'T HAD THE FULL COOPERATION OF ALL REGIONAL ENTITIES LAUGH GO HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO OVERSEE THIS TRANSITION THEY'RE SEEKING INDEMNIFICATION AND PROTECTION THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE ALL CURRENT OBLIGATIONS ARE FULLY ASSIGNED. YOU GET ALL THE JURISDICTIONS IN THEIR LAWYERS TOGETHER. AS A LAWYER MYSELF I KNOW WHAT LAWYERS DO WHEN THEY GET CLOSE ROOMS TOGETHER. EVERYONE HAS A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO HOW THINGS SHOULD BE SOLVED SO WE BELIEVE THAT THIS THREAD A NEEDLE OF CREATING AN ONGOING GLIDE PATH FOR THE DISSOLUTION OF FOR A CONSISTENT. WITH THE DISSOLUTION PLAN APPROVED BY THE FOR A BOARD IN WOULD ASK FOR YOUR COMMITTEES SUPPORT IN FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR -- THESE ARE TOUGH ONES. I'VE BEEN THERE DONE THAT WE'VE HAD A COUPLE OF FACILITIES WE'VE HAD TO A PARTICULAR ONE IN MY DISTRICT.

EVERYTHING EVERYTHING GET WHAT THEY WANT THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN THAT WAY YOU KNOW YOU GOT ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES GOT THE HOUSING ISSUES YOU'VE GOT OLD BUILDINGS YOU GOT. AS BEST AS I MEAN BEEN THERE DONE THIS IT'S NOT FUN AND IT'S DIFFICULT.

OKAY WELCOME WELL THANK YOU -- I WANT TO SAY THAT MY MOM AND DAD -- BEFORE THEY GOT MARRIED WENT TO DANCES AT FORT ORD. SO. SHE'S FROM HOLLISTER. HE'S FROM LOS GATOS OF THESE THE FOR THEY GOT MARRIED THEY WENT WITH OTHER FRIENDS DOWN THERE SO. IT'S GOT GOOD MEMORIES THERE. SO GOOD AFTERNOON -- MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS AND PRESIDING SB FIVE TODAY. THIS IS -- PART OF A PACKAGE OF BILLS THAT CENTER MCGUIRE AND I HAVE WITH CENTER PORTANTINO. AND THE PACKAGE IS BASED ON INPUT GATHERED THROUGH A SERIES OF PUBLIC HEARINGS WE CONVENE. ROUTE THE STATE THIS FALL WE WENT AROUND WE DID A TOUR OF THE STATE WE LISTENED AND HEARD A LOT OF CRITICISM. BUT WE DECIDED WE CAN PULL SOMETHING TOGETHER HERE AND THAT'S WHERE WE CAME UP WITH SB. FIVE HOUSINGS CRISIS IS STAGGERING AND SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTIES. WE HAVE BEEN PRODUCED THAT EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND NECESSARY NEW HOUSING UNITS PER YEAR. NOW AS RESULT OF NEARLY A HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN. IN CALIFORNIA LIVED IN OUR STREETS LAST YEAR. THERE IS OFTEN A MISCONCEPTION ABOUT. WHO WE ARE TALKING ABOUT WHEN WE'D SAY HOMELESS AND? YOU KNOW WE KNOW NOW THAT IT'S COLLEGE STUDENTS WORKING FAMILIES OUR NEIGHBORS ARE BEING PUSHED DOWN THE HOMELESSNESS BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD RANTS. AND THIS YEAR'S BUDGET WE TOOK SOME BIG STEPS AND INCLUDE A HISTORIC ONE TIME. INVESTMENTS TO HELP SHELTER THOSE ON OUR CITY STREETS AND PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT FUNDS. TO GET A LOCAL GOVERNMENT. INVOLVED IN COMPLIANCE WITH THEIR HOUSING ELEMENTS BUT IT FAILS TO ADDRESS THE ROOT CAUSE OF OUR HOMELESSNESS PROGRAM WHICH IS THE LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS -- IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE TWO POINT TWO MILLION. OF THE CATEGORY OF EXTREMELY LOW INCOME AND VERY LOW INCOME RENTER HOUSEHOLDS AND THEIR COMPUTING ACTUALLY FIRST. SIX HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR THOUSAND AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS SO THAT LEAVES -- OF SHORTAGE. OF ONE POINT FIVE FOUR MILLION CALIFORNIANS OF LOWEST INCOME HOUSEHOLDS THAT'S HOUSEHOLDS NOT PEOPLE. WITHOUT ACCESS TO HOUSING AND THE RISK OF BECOMING HOMELESS AND CITIES LIKE SO LOS ANGELES FOR EXAMPLE BECAUSE DESPITE THE BEST INTENTIONS THAT PASSED THE BOND ELECTION THE THEIR KEEP. THEY KEEP WORLD STRUGGLING. TO KEEP UP WITH THE EVER GROWING PRODUCTION NEEDS TO KEEP WROTE THE RENT BURDEN VERY AND VERY LOW INCOME FAMILIES OFF THE STREETS AND THEY'RE NOT. THEY'RE FALLING BEHIND. SIX OF THE TRUTH -- FALLING BEHIND. AND MARKET RATE HOUSING IS PART OF THE SOLUTION OF COURSE BUT WITHOUT DELIBERATE INVESTMENTS. IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING IT CONTRIBUTES TO THE RISING COST OF RENTS. AND THAT'S WHY THE STATE NEEDS TO INVEST ONGOING FUNDS. TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING. NOW SB FIVE DOES A CREATES A LONG TERM FINANCIAL PARTNER TO IMMEDIATELY CONSTRUCT. DESPERATELY NEEDED HOUSING. FOR HARD WORKING CALIFORNIANS AND COMPLIMENTS THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. AND OUR LATE -- TWENTY NINETEEN INVEST WE JUST DID. THE BILL CREATES -- EIGHTY SIX THOUSAND NEW AND REHABILITATED HOUSING UNITS. IT HELPS ALLEVIATE POVERTY CREATES JOBS NEEDS ARE STATEWIDE ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS WITHOUT AFFECTING SCHOOL FUNDING. AND SPECIFICALLY -- SB FIVE ALLOWS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO COLLABORATE ON A STATE APPROVED COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT PLANS. WHICH WILL BE FUNDED BY REDUCING THEIR CONTRIBUTION. AND EDUCATION REVENUE AUGMENTATION FUNDS. EMPHASIS WILL BE PAID IT TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF HOUSING FOR VERY LOW LOW AND MODERATE INCOME FAMILIES AS WELL AS TRANSIT ORIENTED. PRIORITY PROJECTS ADDITIONALLY INFILL DEVELOPMENT AND PROJECTS THAT MEDICAID. MITIGATE DEFECTIVE SEALEVEL RISE IN CLIMATE CHANGE OR ALSO PRIORITIZE -- SB FIVE CREATES A A CAP. ON THE FUNDING AVAILABLE AT TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY BEGINNING IN TWENTY TWENTY AND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION. ANNUALLY AFTER THAT IN FIVE AFTER THE PROGRAM IS RAMPED UP OR A TEN YEAR PERIOD IT CANNOT EXCEED THE TENT TWO BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. THE STATE GENERAL FUNDS WILL YOU WILL BE USED TO BACK FILL THE PROPERTY TAX -- SCHOOL FUNDS ACCORDING TO THE LA -- REPORT THE BILL HAD NO IMPACT ON SPENT ON SCHOOL FUNDING. THE LEGISLATURE CAN SUSPEND NEW PLANS DURING THE FISCAL DOWNTURNS THE BILL ALIGNS WITH OTHER STATE AND FEDERAL PROGRAMS TO ENSURE. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS LEVERAGE ADDITIONAL NON STATE GENERAL FUNDS. AND THE LEGISLATURE CONSTRAINTS. STRONG ACCOUNTABILITY PROVISIONS TO ENSURE FUNDS ARE ONLY SPENT ON THE DESIGNATED PROJECTS AND TO PROTECT THE SCHOOL FUNDING. THE BILL CAN CREATE A STATE COMMITTEE. A HOUSE UNDER THE HOUSING COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT. TO REVIEW AND APPROVE PROPOSED PLANS PROVIDING STRONG STATE OVERSIGHT. THE COMMITTEE IS THIS COMMITTEE IS EMPOWERED TO TAKE CORRECTIVE ACTION. WHEN LOCALS DID NOT MEET THEIR PLAN OBJECTIVES THIS IS SUPPORTED BY A LARGE COALITION? OF BUSINESS LABOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT HOUSING ADVOCATES AND COMMUNITY LEADERS -- WILL TURN IT OVER WITNESSES RDS FROM THE BUILDING CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL AND MAYOR JOHN DUNBAR FROM A YOUNG BILL. AND WE'LL TURN OVER. JOHN WAS OVER GO AHEAD. GONNA GO FIRST. THANK YOU WELCOME. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M JOHN DUNBAR MAYOR OF THE TOWN OF YOU DON'T FILL. I'M ALSO HERE TODAY IS THE SECOND VICE PRESIDENT OF THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES. AND I WANT TO EXPRESS THE LEAGUES AND MY SUPPORT FOR SENATE BILL. FIVE I COMMEND THE GOVERNOR'S LEADERSHIP TO INSPIRE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT ALL INCOME LEVELS. I APPLAUD HIS COMMITMENT TO SUPPORT LOCAL GOVERNMENT. WITH SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN THE BUDGET. WHICH CALL FOR MORE THAN TWO BILLION DOLLARS FOR HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS HOWEVER. THESE FUNDS LARGELY ARE ONE TIME REVENUES. SB FIVE WOULD COMPLEMENT THE BUDGET ALLOCATIONS BY CREATING AN ONGOING FUNDING PARTNERSHIP. BETWEEN THE STATE AND CALIFORNIA CITIES. THE JUMPSTART THE ACTUAL PRODUCTION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS. THIS NEW PROGRAM WOULD PROVIDE CITIES AND COUNTIES. THE RESOURCES TO SUBSIDIZE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. INVESTED RELATED INFRASTRUCTURE AND ADDRESS OTHER CRITICAL STATE PRIORITIES. LIKE CLIMATE CHANGE IN FIRE WISE BUILDING. LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS ARE PREPARED TO USE THE REVENUE GENERATED BY SB. FIVE TO SUPPORT THE CONSTRUCTION OF BELOW MARKET RATE UNITS FOR FAMILIES STRUGGLING TO AFFORD HOUSING YOUR THEIR JOBS. DEVELOP TRANSIT ORIENTED HOUSING THAT WILL REDUCE TRAFFIC CONGESTION. THE COURAGE URBAN INFILL DEVELOPMENT. BY HER REHABILITATING AN IMPROVING INFRASTRUCTURE. AND PROTECT COMMUNITIES ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY SEA LEVEL RISE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND OTHER SECURE SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. NOW BILL IS A SMALL TOWN TO FEWER THAN THREE THOUSAND RESIDENTS WHEN THE HEART OF THE NAPA VALLEY. IN. NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT NAPA COUNTY ADOPTED THE NATION'S FIRST AGRICULTURAL PRESERVE IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE RURAL CHARACTER AND ECONOMY OF OUR REGION. DESPITE LOCAL EFFORTS INCLUDING THE PASSAGE LAST YEAR. OF A COUNTY WIDE 1% INCREASE IN THE HOTEL TAX THAT'S DEDICATED TO WORKFORCE HOUSING PROJECTS. WE STRUGGLE WITH HIGH HOME PRICES AND LOW INVENTORY. THAT KEEP HOUSING. OUT OF REACH FOR MANY WORKING HOUSEHOLDS. THE LARGEST EMPLOYER IN OUR COMMUNITIES THE CALIFORNIA VETERANS HOME. WHICH IS HOME TO CLOSE TO ONE THOUSAND MILITARY VETERANS. AND NEARLY NINE HUNDRED EMPLOYEES. UP TO ONE HUNDRED CARE GIVER JOBS REMAIN UNFILLED AT THE VETERANS HOME. MAINLY BECAUSE THE COST OF LIVING IN THE AREA DOES NOT ALIGN WITH HOUSEHOLD INCOMES. OUR NAPA VALLEY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT CONTINUES TO EXPERIENCE DECLINING ENROLLMENT IN LARGE PART BECAUSE FAMILIES CANNOT AFFORD TO LIVE IN THE AREA. THE RELATED DROP IN STATE FUNDING HAS RESULTED IN MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN BUDGET CUTS. AN IMMINENT CLOSURE OF SEVERAL HIGH PERFORMING BUT SMALL PUBLIC SCHOOLS INCLUDING. YOUNTVILLE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WHICH DATES BACK TO THE EIGHTEEN EIGHTIES. FOR MORE THAN THREE YEARS I WORK WITH LEADERSHIP OF THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS GENERAL SERVICES. HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE TO BRING HOUSING TO UNDER UTILIZED AREAS. OF THE SIX HUNDRED PLUS ACRE VETERANS HOME CAMPUS. IN CONJUNCTION WITH GOVERNOR NEWSOME'S EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT PRIORITIZES ACCESS STATE OWNED PROPERTY FOR HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. WE HAVE IDENTIFIED LOCATION SUITABLE FOR HOUSING. AND THE TOWN OF YOKO HAS COMMITTED ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR A FEASIBILITY STUDY. TO CREATE HOUSING THE CONSERVATORIES. HOMELESS VETERANS AND OTHERS. COMBINED WITH EXISTING PLANNING DESIGN DOLLARS SB FIVE COULD PROVIDE ENOUGH MONEY TO ACTUALLY GET THIS HOUSING BILLS. THIS MONTH THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES IS EXPECTED TO RELEASE ITS LIST OF AN ESTIMATED ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY STATE OWNED PROPERTIES. SUITABLE FOR HOUSING. CITIES ARE PREPARING RIGHT NOW TO PARTNER WITH THE STATE AND THE DEVELOPMENT INDUSTRY TO MOVE THE NEEDLE ON HOUSING AFFORDABILITY AND AVAILABILITY. WITH SB FIVE DOLLARS THESE OPPORTUNITIES CAN GO FROM CONCEPT TO REALITY. I URGE YOU TO VOTE A ON SENATE BILL FIVE AND SUPPORT INVESTMENT IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WELCOME THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS SISTER THE OTHER BEHALF FOR THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS LEGISLATION. ARE WE WANT TO THANK THE SENATOR FOR INTRODUCING THIS VERY INNOVATIVE -- CREATIVE WAY TO FUND AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE ALSO WANT TO THANK MANY MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE ESPECIALLY YOU MAN CHAIR FOR YOUR EFFORTS TO TRY TO ADDRESS THE VOTER THRESHOLD ISSUES THAT EXISTS -- FOR THE LOCAL LEVEL AS LOCALITIES ARE SEEKING TO ACTUALLY DO FOR THEMSELVES AND PROVIDE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING FUNDING SO THEY CAN BUILDING INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE PROJECT NEEDED. TO KEEP PEOPLE IN THEIR HOMES AND IN THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. THIS BILL IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT TRIES TO BRIDGE ONLY AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUT CLIMATE CHANGE ISSUES IN A WAY THAT IS MEANINGFUL. THE STATE DOES HAVE TO PARTICIPATE IN A VERY MEANINGFUL WAY TO PROVIDE THAT TYPE OF LEVERAGE FUNDING RESOURCES. IT HAS DONE SO THROUGH SB TWO BACK IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AS WELL AS SB. THREE THOSE WERE MONUMENTAL BUT THERE WERE DOWN PAYMENT AND THE NECESSARY FUNDING THAT'S REQUIRED BECAUSE OF THE LOSS OF REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES. THAT WAS A HARD HIT ARE WE STILL HAVE NOT RECOVERED FROM THAT AND I THINK WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PUT THE PUZZLE BACK TOGETHER IN A WAY THAT DOES NOT HARM SCHOOLS. AND OTHER VERY VITAL PUBLIC SERVICES THAT ARE PROVIDED THROUGH THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THIS BILL ACHIEVES THAT WE BELIEVE THAT IS A VERY CREATIVE VERY COLLABORATIVE IT'S A GOOD WAY TO ACTUALLY ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT ARE BEING WORKED BY REYES BY. OUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS IN THE A SCHOOL COMMUNITY. WE ALSO THINK THAT THE BILL CONTAINS VERY IMPORTANT PROTECTIONS FOR THE WORKERS THAT ARE ACTUALLY BUILDING THE HOUSING AND BY ENSURING THAT THERE'S APPRENTICES ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO PARTICIPATE THEY'RE ALSO ALL LOOKING TO THE WORKFORCE SHORTAGE. SAID THERE'S GOING TO BE THE READILY ACCESSIBLE SKILLED AND TRAINED WORK FORCE TO ADDRESS THE FUTURE PROJECTS FOR ANY FUTURE TYPE OF BIG MARKET RATE PRODUCTION TYPE LEGISLATION. SO WE BELIEVE SB FIVE IS COMPLEMENTED COMPLEMENTARY TO THE GOVERNOR'S HOUSING GOALS AND THE STATE BUDGET. TO PROVIDE NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO WORK TOGETHER REVITALIZED COMMUNITIES AND BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHILE ADDRESSING THE CLIMATE. CHANGE IMPACTS PROVIDING GOOD MIDDLE CLASS JOBS IN A TIME OF A LOT OF INCOME INEQUALITY FOR THOSE REASONS WE STRONGLY URGE YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT JUST YOUR NAME IN YOUR TITLE IN YOUR ABSOLUTELY MADAM CHAIR -- MANAGER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE PLUGINS ALL OF US HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE CITIES OF LAKE WOULD ROSEMEAD BELAY -- Là MARADA ROSE FILL THOUSAND OAKS CAME RIO RANCHO CUCAMONGA SIR RIDEAU'S PALMDALE ATASCADERO NORWALK AND PARAMOUNT.

ARE THERE ANY OTHERS IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION WELCOME GOOD AFTERNOON AND JENNIFER BAKER WITH THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION ON AND UNFORTUNATELY WE DO OPPOSE THE BILL AND IT'S A VERY PRECARIOUS SITUATION -- THAT WERE INVOLVED AND WE ABSOLUTELY DON'T -- OPPOSE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND WE BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO TAKE SIGNIFICANT STEPS TO HELP -- FAMILIES TO BE ABLE TO HAVE AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE SEE THE IMPACT OF THAT DIRECTLY IN THE CLASSROOM AS OUR SCHOOL SYSTEMS ARE WORKING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN GIVE STUDENTS AS MUCH OF A STABLE ENVIRONMENT IN THE CLASSROOM. WHEN WE HAVE THEM DURING THE DAY -- THE SOLE DILEMMA THAT WE HAVE WITH THIS MEASURE IS THE USE OF THE RAF FUNDS THAT HAS AN IMPACT ON PROPERTY TAXES THAT WOULD GO TO SCHOOLS. NOW FORTUNATELY CENTER BILL HAS BEEN EXTREMELY HELPFUL IN TRYING TO AMELIORATE ANY KIND OF ISSUES OF THAT HE CAN IN REGARD TO TRYING TO PROTECT SCHOOLS SO WHEN WE ARE IN GOOD ECONOMIC TIMES LIKE THIS YEAR TO NOT A PROBLEM THE BILL DOESN'T HURT AS IT DOESN'T. IMPACT US IN A NEGATIVE WAY AND WE DO APPRECIATE THAT MULTITUDE OF A TENSE THAT THE CENTER HAS. TRIED TO ACHIEVE TO ADDRESS -- ISSUES THAT COULD HARM SCHOOLS OUR PROBLEM IS WHAT HAPPENS IF WE GET INTO ANOTHER FISCAL DECLINE WHICH COULD POTENTIALLY HAPPEN WE LEARN VERY CLEARLY DURING THIS PAST RECESSION WHEN PROP NINETY EIGHT WAS SUSPENDED TWICE. THAT OUR SCHOOLS ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT HARM THE ANALYSIS OF THE MEASURE ACTUALLY NOTES THAT GENERALLY THE THE GENERAL FUND WILL BACK FILL OUR SCHOOLS AND THIS SIGNIFICANT WORD TO KIAN ON IS GENERALLY BECAUSE TWICE IN THE PAST DECADE. THE STATE DID NOT BACK FOR ALL OUR SCHOOLS THAT IS THE SOLE REASON WHY WERE OPPOSING THIS MEASURE IF WE DO GO INTO AN ECONOMIC DECLINE. THIS OUR SCHOOLS THAT ARE RELIANT ON THOSE PROPERTY TAX REVENUES COULD BE IN A SITUATION WHERE THE STATE COULD CHOOSE NOT TO BACK FILL. I'M IN THE DILEMMA THAT WE WOULD HAVE IS IF WE'RE IN THAT ECONOMIC SITUATION THE SCHOOLS THAT ARE RELYING ON THOSE FUNDS WOULD BE HURT EVEN MORE SIGNIFICANTLY THAN THEY WERE OR IN THE LAST ECONOMIC DECLINE. BECAUSE WHEN TIMES ARE TOUGH IN IF THE STATE DOESN'T BACKFILL SCHOOLS THE PROPERTY TAXES THAT THEY WOULD RECEIVE WOULD HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN A MORE STABLE ECONOMIC SOURCE -- THEN THE PROP NINETY EIGHT FUNDS THAT THEY COULD HAVE RECEIVED AN UNECONOMIC DECLINE FOR SO FOR THOSE REASONS CTA'S UNFORTUNATELY IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH YES MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS. GOOD AFTERNOON DAVID WOLF WITH THE HOWARD JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION OPPOSED SB. FIVE AND MEMBERS I ACTUALLY IS SORT OF BIZARRE BUT I WANT TO MERE SOME OF MS BAKER'S COMMENTS THIS -- SIMPLY SIMPLY IN REGARDS TO THE FISCAL IMPACT OF THIS BILL. OF THE MONEY HERE THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. YOU KNOW COULD RESULT IN WOULD BE THE EQUIVALENT OF A THIRTY BILLION DOLLAR GENERAL FUND BOND I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S HE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE THAT COULD BE BONDED OUT. OVER A PERIOD OF DECADES BUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A GENERAL OBLIGATION BOND AND WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED IN SB. FIVE IS THAT G. O. BONDS REQUIRE A TWO THIRDS VOTE OF THE LEGISLATURE AND STATEWIDE VOTER APPROVAL NONE OF THAT EXISTS UNDER SB. FIVE RIGHT NOW LISTEN WE HAVE A DEBT SERVICE RATIO IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA 6% THAT MEANS THE FIRST 6% OF REVENUE OUT OF STATE GENERAL FUND GOES TO NOTHING MORE OR LESS THAN PAYING OFF. BOND AND TO MISS BAKER'S POINT WE REALLY DO NEED TO BE CONCERNED I THINK WHEN AND IT WILL BE WHEN AND NOT IF WE HAD AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN THAT WE SIMPLY DO NOT HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY. GOING FORWARD WITH FIND AT AND OTHER GENERAL FUND EXPENDITURES TO BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH THIS PROBLEM -- NUMBER TWO REGARDING -- PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS HAMMOND COME IN OBVIOUSLY AN IMPORTANT ISSUE AT THE HOWARD JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION. EXPLICIT EMINENT DOMAIN AUTHORITY IS IN THIS BILL AND IS EXPRESSLY NOT PROHIBIT. THE TAKING OF PRIVATE PROPERTY SHOULD AND FUNDAMENTALLY ONLY BE FOR A PRIVATE USE AND THAT RESTRICTION IS NOT IN THE BILL. MEMBERS IN CLOSING WE DO NEED TO ASK AND THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE WITH SB TWO AND SB THREE FLOATING AROUND OUT THERE THERE ARE EXISTING DEDICATED SOURCES OF REVENUE. FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROGRAMS THEIR EXISTING REVENUE STREAMS OUT THERE IN THE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR SB THREE WAS A FIVE BILLION DOLLAR HOUSING BOND. PLENTY OF MONEY THERE -- BUT IN EXCHANGE WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH SB FIVE IS IT WORTH THE LIMITING OUR FLEXIBILITY TO ISSUE BONDS. IS IT WORTH LIMITING FUNDING FOR OTHER GENERAL FUND PROGRAMS AND IS IT WORTH NOT CREATING ONE OR TWO OR EVEN -- THREE YOU KNOW REVENUE STREAMS OUT OF THIS BILL BUT UP TEN NINE NEW REVENUE STREAMS TO FUND THIS PROPOSAL. ON AVERAGE THAT'S ONE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR OF GENERAL FUND COSTS AND IT COULD GO -- THEY COULD GO MUCH MUCH HIGHER THAN THAT AND THIS CLASS OVER THIRTY EIGHT YEARS MEMBERS. THIRTY EIGHT YEARS AND AFTER NINE YEARS WE ARE LOCKED IN. LOCKED INTO THE SPENDING WITH NO WAY OUT. AND AGAIN WHEN YOU'RE FACING UNIQUE A POTENTIAL ECONOMIC DOWNTURN IN THE FUTURE THIS DOESN'T SEEM LIKE A WISE FISCAL PATH TASK FOR NUMBER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. BROUGH UP TO THE MICROPHONE NAME -- PARKER THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BOARDS ASSOCIATION FOR THE COMMAS PREVIOUS SEDATED WERE IN OPPOSITION.

THROUGH THAT MONEY IN THE BACK FEELING OF THAT [inaudible] WELL -- TO GET THAT CLARIFIED WE ACTUALLY WENT TO THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND WE ASK THEM TO ANALYZE THIS PARTICULAR QUESTION -- IT TURNS OUT THAT THIS IS BEEN DONE BEFORE. IN TERMS OF THE E. RAF -- SHIFTING TO PAY OFF -- STATE DATIN FOR STATE PURPOSES BACK WHEN. THE EARLY YOU KNOW LIKE FIFTEEN YEARS AGO. WHEN WHEN THIS OCCURRED BUT THIS BILL AND ONLY THIS BILL? HAS A SPECIFIC SECTION IN IT THAT GUARANTEES THAT ALL THE FUNDS THAT ARE TAKEN OUT OF THE E. RAFFLE BE BACK FILLED. BY THE STATE GENERAL FUND AND IF THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN OCCURS AS QUESTION -- WE FOUND OUT THAT PEOPLE HAD QUESTIONS ABOUT THERE IS THERE IS A PAUSE BUTTON THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR CAN DO COULD PUSH. THAT WILL STOP THIS PROGRAM FROM CONTINUING. AND IT WILL -- IT IS IN ESSENCE -- SAY WE'RE NOT GOING TO THIS PROGRAM THIS YEAR BECAUSE OF THE PROBLEM. WITH -- PROP NINETY EIGHT SO THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S CONCLUDED. ED SAYS -- IT IS IN THE SUMMARY I GOT THEY HAVE A THREE PAGE LETTER THEY RIP THEY WROTE. AND IT'S PUBLISHED A PUBLISHED LETTER. IS IS UNDER SB FIVE THE STATE WOULD REQUIRED TO READ BENCH THE RAFT REDUCTIONS. AUTHORIZED BY THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENT PROGRAM. THIS REQUIREMENT MEANS THE STATE EFFECTIVELY WOULD BE COVERING THE COST OF THE PROGRAM THROUGH GENERAL FUND SPENDING RATHER THAN REDUCTION IN SCHOOL FUNDING. IN OTHER WORDS IT'S GOING TO BE COMPLETELY COVERED AND I THINK IF YOU WANTED TO GET INTO DETAIL. OF FURTHER ON THE SUBJECT -- THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST HAS HAS LOOKED AT SO -- WE WE'VE LOOKED AT THIS MANY DIFFERENT WAYS WE PUT A LOT OF GUARANTEES TO PROTECT SCHOOLS AND I THINK THEY RECOGNIZE THAT WE TRIED TO DO THAT. THEY'RE JUST OBJECTING TO THE USE OF THE ROUGH I THINK. THEY KNOW THAT THIS BILL AS OPPOSED TO MANY OTHER BILLS THAT HAVE GONE THROUGH THIS COMMITTEE. AND THROUGH THE SENATE -- RELATING TO PROPERTY TAX -- OF SHIPS. THAT HAD NO PROTECTION WHATSOEVER. THIS BILL IS THE ONLY BILL THIS YEAR THAT ACTUALLY HAS THE PROPERTY TAX PROTECTION. OF ANY KIND OF SHOW OF PROTECTING SCHOOLS SO. SO SOME OF THE COMMENTS AS FAR AS WHAT'S BEEN DONE IN THE PAST AS FAR AS BACK FEELING NOT COMING TO FRUITION DURING SOME. OF TOUGH TIMES WITHIN THE BUDGET THIS BILL HAS BUILT IN PROTECTIONS TO ENSURE THAT ANY MONEY COMING OUT OF THROUGH THIS BILL FROM PROP NINETY EIGHT WILL. WILL BE BACK FIELD AND IF THERE IS SOME HESITANCE TO THAT THE LEGISLATURE DOES HAVE THE WHERE WITH ALL TO STOP THAT. FROM CONTINUING FOR THAT'S DIFFERENT THAN WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON IN THE PAST. AND WE HAVE ALSO OF COURSE NOW. THE LAW REQUIRES IS TO HAVE A RAINY DAY FUND. WHICH PROVIDES A RESERVE IN CASE WE NEED TO USE THAT AND IF THE RAINY DAY FUND ISSUES THIS BILL FREEZES PROGRAM. AND PROHIBITS OF PROHIBITED TO GO ON FOR EXAMPLE. SO WE HAVE WE HAVE SOME PROTECTIONS IN THE BILL THAT PROTECT OUR SCHOOLS OKAY THANK YOU I WOULD HAVE OPPOSE A BILL OF THAT MYSELF PERSONALLY. OKAY I REMEMBER CHAIR AND THE FINAL BILL DEPARTMENT AS WELL AS ME IT'S THAT THE COMMITTEE'S TIME -- EXCUSE ME OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER VOEPEL. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. SENATE BILL. ON PAGE TWENTY FOUR THE BILL LINES TWENTY ONE THROUGH TWENTY FOUR IT SAYS IT THIS NEWLY ALONG. THIS NEW ENTITY AS ALLOWED TO ACQUIRE IN TRANSFER REAL PROPERTY AND CARRY ON ANY OTHER ACT NECESSARY TO CARRY OUT A PROJECT. SOME OF IT INTERPRETED THIS INCLUDING MYSELF TO INCLUDE THE POWER OF EMINENT DOMAIN. AND I KNOW THAT THERE WAS MUCH BACK AND FORTH IN A HOUSING COMMITTEE ABOUT WHETHER. THAT IS WHAT IT MEANS -- SO I KNOW THIS IS BEEN BEAT UP A LITTLE BIT BEFORE. GIVEN THE CONTROVERSIAL NATURE OF THIS POWER AND TO MAKE THE LANGUAGE MORE CLEAR. WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO ADD A SIMPLE LINE TO THE EFFECT. OF NO PROPERTY SHALL BE ACQUIRED OR TRANSFERRED BY EXERCISING THE POWER OF EMINENT DOMAIN. YOU COULD MAKE THAT AMENDMENT OR THROW THAT IN THEN I WOULD BE. LOVELY TO SUPPORT THIS BILL WELL WE WE DID WE DID LOOK AT THAT AS KIND OF THE BILL DOES NOT. CHANGE EMINENT DOMAIN OFF OKAY FIRST OF ALL. IT DOES NOT MAKE IT EASIER TO EXPAND WHO ARE WATER WHEN IT CAN BE USE IT DOESN'T MAKE A CHANGE ON EMINENT DOMAIN. AND THE EXISTING FINANCE TOOLS THAT WE HAVE. RIGHT NOW ALL OF SUCH AS ENHANCE INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCE DISTRICTS AND SO FORTH. THEY ALREADY HAVE THE EMINENT DOMAIN IN THOSE LAWS THEY HAVE THAT ENTERED THIS BILL DOES NOT HAVE. EMINENT DOMAIN MENTIONED AND THAT. IS IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THAT THE BILL'S FOCUS ALSO IS ON BUILDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING. NOT ON ELIMINATING BLIGHTED DOING SLUM CLEARANCE KIND OF REDEVELOPMENT OLDSCHOOL REDEVELOPMENT TYPE PROJECTS THAT'S NOT THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL THIS PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IT ALSO INCLUDES TEN PROTECTIONS SUCH AS ANTI DISPLACEMENT PROTECTIONS. AND THEREFORE I DO NOT EXPECT A LOT OF ARE INTO IT ENTITIES USING THIS THIS -- BILL TO FINANCE ANYTHING WILL USE EMINENT DOMAIN SPECIFICALLY THE BILL REQUIRES EACH PROJECT IDENTIFIED IN THE PLAN. A REQUIREMENT AND KNOWING FICTION. HAS BEEN MADE ON A PROJECT SITE WITHIN THE LAST TEN YEARS. PROTECTIONS TO AVOID DISPLACEMENT INDIVIDUALS BY THE PROJECTS SO SO THERE IS THERE IS SOME REALLY SERIOUS -- PROTECTIONS -- THAT I I THINK RESULT IN VERY LITTLE IF IF IF NOT ALL. OF VERY VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF EMINENT DOMAIN PERIOD AND I DON'T THINK IT'S NECESSARY TO ELIMINATE -- THAT IS AND YOU KNOW IN THIS BILL I MEAN IF YOU WANT TO INTRODUCE A BILL AN EMINENT DOMAIN TO DISCUSS IT THAT'S A POLICY ISSUE. THAT WE SHOULD HAVE MORE OR BROADER DISCUSSIONS ON I MEAN THIS IS -- A BIGGER ISSUE SO. THAT'S I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY MY ANSWER FOR YOU I HOPE I DID THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE. HEY WE HAD RIVER MOTION YET. OKAY WE HAVE A MOTION. WE HAVE A SECOND -- I DO HAVE THIS IS A SUPPORT WITH AMENDMENTS IS THAT TRUE. OKAY. EXCEPT THE MOMENT OKAY -- WHO WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE? THANK YOU VERY MUCH I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE SOME INVESTMENTS IN THE IN THE HOUSING ON ON GOING BASIS WE DID A GREAT JOB ON THE BUDGET -- THE BUDGET -- DOES NOT -- INCLUDE ANY ONGOING HOUSING FUNDS. OF THE THE HOUSING BOND WAS. THREE THREE BILLION DOLLARS NOT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS TO SO WE CAN CORRECT THAT SO I I THINK I THINK -- WE NEED TO HAVE THIS ON GOING A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CITIES IF WE'RE GOING TO BE CLOSING RULES REGULATIONS. REQUIREMENTS. ND SO FOR ON THE CITY WE GOT INTO SOME TO PROVIDE THEM WITH SOME AND CENTER THE BILL THE HOUSING THIS IS WHAT THIS BILL DOES I REGION I VOTE -- SENATOR I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY BUT IF YOU HAVE A COUPLE OF COMMENTS NUMBER ONE IS THAT -- I SIT BACK AND THINK ABOUT WHERE ARM MAYOR OF FROM -- TELL REAL BILL IS -- THEIR STRUGGLE LIVING ON THE BEAUTIFUL NAPA VALLEY WITH GETTING HOUSING AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IN THAT AREA THE IN THE SCHOOLS ARE STRUGGLING BECAUSE AND CLOSING BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE HOUSING FOR THE TEACHERS. AND SO -- I THINK ABOUT THAT FOR A RURAL AREAS A MINT THE STATE'S VAST AND WE GET LEFT OUT SOMETIMES IN A RURAL COMMUNITIES AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR MAKING SURE THAT. YOUR ENSURING THAT ARE REAL COMMUNITIES HAVE A FAIR SHOT RECEIVING SOME OF THIS FUNDING AND THAT'S IMPORTANT TO ME PERSONALLY. AND THAT -- EACH COMMUNITY HAS A DIFFERENT LOOK ABOUT IT BUT THIS IS I THINK. A GOOD BILL AND I APPRECIATE YOUR BRINGING IT FORWARD -- FOR MAKING SURE YOUR HOUSING FOR SO MANY PEOPLE IN THE STATE. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I'LL BE SUPPORTING TODAY SECRETARY. THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED AND RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS AGUIAR-CURRY. AGUIAR-CURRY I LACKEY VOTING LACKEY NOT VOTING BLOOM. BLOOM AYE BOERNER HORVATH. BOERNER HORVATH I RAMOS. RAMOS SIDE GONZALEZ. GONZALEZ I ROBERT RIVAS VOEPEL. VOEPEL NOT VOTING. MEASURES OUT FIVE ZERO THANK YOU VERY MUCH VERY MUCH SENATOR. THANK YOU FOR SHOWING UP. ALL RIGHT WE HAVE ITEM NUMBER EIGHT IS. SENATOR WIENER HERE I KNOW HE WAS -- THERE YOU ARE HIDING BEHIND EVERYONE. I KNOW I WAS. LOOKING FOR YOU [inaudible] ALL RIGHT. LET OF THEIR A PISTOL. THE RING [inaudible] TO CARILLO [inaudible] EVERYONE. OKAY WELCOME SENATOR ITEM NUMBER EIGHT SB FIVE NINETY TWO MISTER WEINER WE LIKE TO PEOPLE SPEAK IN SUPPORT TO IN A POSITION IN THE ME TO USE THE THREE TWO AND THEN SOMEONE HERE PER AT FOR ANY QUESTIONS. THAT'S FABULOUS OKAY PLEASE BEGIN I THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MADAM CHAIRMAN THANK YOUR YOUR STAFF -- FOR WORKING WITH US SENATE TO FIVE NINETY TWO AND I'M HAPPY TO ACCEPT. OF THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENT TO REMOVE THE COMPENSATORY DAMAGES PROVISION -- FROM THE BILL. I SENATE BILL -- FIVE NINETY TWO CLARIFIES EXISTING LAW CONTAINED IN THE HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND. OF THE COUNTRY TO SOME STATEMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE BY SOME ABOUT THE BILL. OF HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT IS NOT BEING ENACTED BY THIS BILL IT WAS ENACTED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO WHEN I WAS TWELVE YEARS OLD -- AND HAS BEEN ON THE BOOKS FOR THIRTY SEVEN YEARS -- TWO YEARS AGO AS PART OF THE LEGISLATURE'S HOUSING PACKAGE ON THE BILL -- SOME MORE TEETH IN ENFORCEMENT WERE PUT INTO THE BILL. AND TODAY -- BEFORE USE -- FIVE NINE TWO WHICH MAKE SOME CLARIFICATIONS -- AND CLOSES SOME LOOPHOLES IN THE BILL -- TO MAKE CLEAR WHAT WE THINK IS ALREADY THE INTENT OF THE BILL. AND WHAT THE HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT IS ABOUT AND WHAT THIS BILL WILL HELP FURTHER. ON THE H. A. IS ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT -- CITIES AND COUNTIES FOLLOW THEIR OWN RULES THAT THEY HAVE ADOPTED AND THAT THEY DON'T CHANGE THE RULES IN THE MIDDLE. OF THE GAME -- SO IF THE CITY HAS ZONED -- PARCEL FOR FOUR UNITS ARE SIX UNITS ARE TEN UNITS. THEN THE CITY NEEDS TO ALLOW ABOUT ZONING TO BE PROPELLED OF ITS OWN FOR THIRTY FEET -- IN NEEDS TO ALLOW THAT IF IT IS ADOPTED CERTAIN OBJECTIVE DESIGN STANDARDS PEOPLE NEED TO BE ABLE TO RELY ON THOSE DESIGN STANDARDS AND CAN'T BE CHAINS AND PULL THE RUG OUT. SO THIS IS REALLY JUST ABOUT CITIES FOLLOWING -- THEIR OWN -- RULES -- AND THAT'S AT THE HEART OF THE H. A THIS BILL -- DOES A FEW THINGS -- IT CLARIFIES -- THAT WHEN THE HA TALKS ABOUT A A LOWER A REDUCTION IN DENSITY OR REDUCTION AND HOUSING -- THAT ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS ON COUNT AS HOUSING -- AND ALSO DIED NEW BEDROOMS -- ACCOUNT AS HOUSING -- TO THE CITY FIVE EIGHTY USE ARE ALLOWED THE CITY CAN'T ARBITRARILY REFUSED TO ALLOW YOU TO PUT THE EIGHTY AND OR IF THE BUILDINGS WHAT IN THE ZONING ALLOW. FOR THREE BEDROOMS YOU HAVE TO BE ALLOWED. TO PUT IN THREE BEDROOMS AND THEY CAN'T ARBITRARILY SAY NO -- YOU CAN ONLY HAVE ONE BEDROOM AND STUFF BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT ANY CHILDREN -- IN THIS COMMUNITY FOR EXAMPLE -- SO -- AGAIN WANT TO THANK THE THE COMMITTEE AND THE CHAIR -- I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE BOAT WITH ME HERE TODAY -- HOLLY FOR MANY FROM HABITAT FOR HUMANITY A JENNIFER STOCKTON CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS AND DEALING CASEY FROM. WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR TECHNICAL QUESTIONS FROM THE CALIFORNIA RENTERS LEGAL ADVOCACY AND EDUCATION FUNDS. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH WELCOME. HI HOLLY FOR ME ON BEHALF OF HABITAT FOR HUMANITY CALIFORNIA AND HABITAT IT'S BEEN FORCED IN RECENT YEARS LIKE MANY OTHER NONPROFITS TO GET REALLY CREATIVE AND HOW DO WE SERVE MORE FAMILIES WITH LESS MONEY AND LESS LAND. SO THE EIGHTY YOU MODEL AND ONE OF OUR AFFILIATES IN SANTA CRUZ HAS BEEN THE TRAILBLAZER AT COMING UP WITH A CREATIVE NEW TOOL TO TRY TO CREATE MORE EIGHTY USED TO ALLOW US TO SERVE AGAIN MORE FAMILIES WITH LESS. WITH LESS LAND AND WITH LESS MONEY. IN SOME OF OUR AFFILIATES OF STARTED TO USE THAT MODEL BECAUSE IT'S CREATED A TENANT IN COMMON ARRANGEMENT HAVE MORE AFFORDABLE CO OWNERSHIP -- OPPORTUNITIES IN THE COMMUNITIES BUT ALSO SOME OF OUR AFFILIATES ARE ALSO STARTING TO BUILD AND FINANCE EIGHTY USE THAT ARE RENTAL PROPERTIES FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES BE RESTRICTED TO HAVE AN ADDITIONAL LOWER INCOME. RENT OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM ON THEIR PROPERTY THAT THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE -- TO BUILD THEMSELVES. THREE TO USE ON THE NATURAL -- ARE MORE AFFORDABLE UNITS WITH LESS SUBSIDY IS BECAUSE THEY'RE SMALLER AND THE RENTS JUST NATURALLY WITHOUT DEED RESTRICTIONS ARE GONNA BE A MORE AFFORDABLE SO WE SUPPORT THAT -- PHILOSOPHICALLY BUT THIS BILL ALSO IS COMPLEMENTARY TO SEVERAL OTHER BILLS THAT THIS COMMITTEE HAS PASSED THIS YEAR AND EIGHTY USE INCLUDING OUR SPONSOR BELL -- HIS FRIEDMAN'S A. B. I'M FIVE EIGHT SEVEN WHICH WE'RE PROUD TO SPONSOR AND AND WITH SEVERAL OTHER BILLS THAT WERE SUPPORTING AND THIS WILL HELP AND YOU DON'T HAVE ENFORCEABLE. MECHANISMS TO ENSURE THAT THAT SAME PROTECTION THAT'S AFFORDED TO OTHER HOUSING UNITS IN THE COMMUNITY UNDER THE H. A. WILL ALSO BE AFFORDED THE SAME PROTECTIONS TO THE EIGHTY UNITS SO WITH THAT WE EXPECT RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE ABOUT. THANK YOU. WELCOME. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JENNIFER SPEC ABOUT FOR THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS BUT WE ARE PLEASED TO BE A SPONSOR OF SB FIVE NINETY TWO WHICH SEEKS TO ENCOURAGE THE DEVELOPMENT OF VITALLY NEEDED HOUSING UNITS BY EXPANDING THE HA A A TO PROTECT. THE EVELOPMENT OF AN EIGHTY YOU OR JUNIOR EIGHTY YOU. THOUSAND CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA IS TAKING THE LARGEST TOLL ON LOW INCOME AND WORKING FAMILIES EVERY TIME LOCAL GOVERNMENTS DENY HOUSING DEVELOPMENT APPLICATIONS FAMILY SUFFER. THE BILL SIMPLY SIX TO HOLD LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ACCOUNTABLE BY PROTECTING FAMILIES ABILITY TO CREATE NEEDY YOU OR TO CONVERT EXISTING BEDROOM TO A JUNIOR EIGHTY YOU. FAMILIES WHO LEGALLY CHALLENGE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS DECISION TO DENY THEIR EIGHTY YOU ARE FACED WITH THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN LEGAL FEES. WHICH CANNOT BE RECOUPED. THE FAMILIES CHALLENGING THAT ALLOW ME WHEN THE DECISION BUT THE MONEY SET ASIDE TO BUILD THE UNIT IS NOW GONE. IT SEEMS ONLY FAIR THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ALSO FACE A FINANCIAL CONSEQUENCE IF THE COURTS FIND THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS DENIED AN EIGHTY YOU WITHOUT APPROPRIATE BECAUSE SB FIVE NINETY TWO ALSO MAKES IT CLEAR THAT PROJECTS CONSISTENT WITH STATE LOCAL PLANNING LAW THE RECEIVE MINISTERIAL APPROVAL ARE. ADDED TO THE AJ. PROJECTS THAT ARE MINISTER WE PROVED ARE BY THEIR NATURE CONSISTENT LOCAL PLANNING AND ZONING AND SHOULD NOT BE DENIED UNLESS THEY VIOLATE HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS AS REQUIRED BY THE HA. SB FIVE NINETY TWO CLOSE TO SEVERAL LOOPHOLES IN HA WHICH WILL HELP LOCAL TOLD LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ACCOUNTABLE FOR PROVING MUCH NEEDED HOUSING UNITS WHEN THOSE UNITS ARE CONSISTENT WITH LOCAL JURISDICTIONS OWN PLANNING AND ZONING LAW. IT'S FOR THESE REASONS THAT WE RESPECTFULLY OUR CLUSTER AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER OTHER OP OF BUSINESSES IN SUPPORT.

A WE HAVE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. CITY GEORGE WITH THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION REALLY APPRECIATE ALL THE AMENDMENTS HAVE BEEN TAKEN WERE DOWN TO JUST A FEW -- I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY WITH WITH THE COMPENSATORYDAMAGES GOING TO BE TAKEN OUT THE COMMITTEE OKAY. THIS WILL MAKE SURE THAT SO WE'RE REALLY DOWN TO ONE MAJOR ISSUE AND THAT IS DEALING WITH THE MINISTERIAL PERMITS -- THE WAY THE LANGUAGES IN THE BILL IT DOESN'T DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN PROJECTS THAT HAVE MINISTERIAL PERMITS AND ALL MINISTERIAL PERMITS AND THE WAY THE HA. IS ACTUALLY STRUCTURED FOR EVERY PERMIT WE WOULD HAVE -- TO DO WHAT EXTENSIVE ANALYSIS EVEN THOUGH IT'S JUST A CHECKLIST SO WE HAVE SUBMITTED SOME LANGUAGE WE THINK WE'LL TAKE CARE OF THAT ISSUE IN CORRAL. THE PROJECTS THAT HAVE THE PERMITS THE MINISTER OF PERMITS AS OPPOSED TO ALL MINISTERIAL PURPOSE REGARDLESS SO WE'RE HOPING WE CAN WORK ON THAT OVER THE TIE THANK YOU I CAN HAVE ONE PERSON APPROVED PROPOSITION IF THERE'S WANTED. TO SPEAK. I'M SORRY WHAT WE ALREADY HAD TO SHE KIND OF GOT MOVE FARTHER THAN. YEAH THERE WERE MORE MEN WITNESS GO AHEAD. WELCOME THANK YOU. I'M GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS HEIDI FELDSTEIN AND I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE STATE WHAT ALLIANCE. CALLED THE BETTER WAY FORWARD HOUSE CALIFORNIA AND ALSO ON BEHALF OF LIVABLE CALIFORNIA -- I'M HERE TO OBJECT TO THIS BILL REALLY ON THREE BASIS THE FIRST ONE IS PROCESS. THIS BILL PASSED THE SENATE AS A BILL ON BARBERS AND COSMETOLOGY IS A LICENSING BILL. IT WAS GUIDED IN AMENDED BEFORE THIS ASSEMBLY AND SHOWED UP AS A HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY BILL BY SURPRISE. THAT IS A PROCESS THAT CANDIDLY PARTICULARLY ON THE SUBJECT THE SENSITIVE THAT HAS DIVIDED OUR STATE. AND HONESTLY DIVIDED OUR PARTY AS STRONGLY AS THIS ONE HAS. REALLY SHOULD NOT BE TOLERATED BY THIS BODY. IT IS NOT NECESSARY AT THIS POINT YOU JUST BACK PAST THREE THIRTY OUT. AND THERE IS NO REASON TO KEEP GOING WITH THESE KINDS OF COTTON AMEND PROCEDURES. ON THERE REALLY MISPERCEIVED BY THE ELECTORATE. AND I WOULD URGE YOU TO NOT GO FORWARD ON A PROCESS BASIS ALONG ALONE THE SECOND REASON IS SUBSTANCE. ALTHOUGH THE BILL HAS BEEN AMENDED AND I REALLY DO APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE DONE IN THE HOUSING COMMITTEE. OM I AM CONCERNED BECAUSE THE LAST WORD FROM CHAIRMAN CHIU WITH THE HOUSING COMMITTEE WAS BE CAREFUL WE MAY USE THE SUMMER RECESS. TO BRING BACK SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE TOOK OUT. AND THAT WOULD BE COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS TAKEN OUT WAS THE ONE THAT WOULD PERMIT MANSIONS. IT BASICALLY SAID THAT THE HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT WOULD APPLY TO A SINGLE UNIT. AND THERE SEEMS TO BE A CONSTANT PUSH FROM SACRAMENTO. TO IMPOSE THE KIND OF LEGISLATION OF ONE SIZE FITS ALL THAT WOULD PERMIT MAKE MANSIONS THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH HOMELESSNESS. NOTHING TO DO WITH AFFORDABILITY. AND IS WAY BEYOND WHAT WE OUGHT TO BE DOING AGAINST LOCAL CONTROLS AND SO I WOULD URGE THIS BODY TO NOT PERMIT. THIS BILL TO GO FORWARD WHEREIT COULD BE GUIDED IN AMENDED TO DO THAT AGAIN. A THIRD REASON IS NEAT. YOU DON'T NEED THIS BILL YOU JUST PASSED OUT SB. THREE THIRTY YOU JUST PASSED OUT SB. THIRTEEN IF ALL THIS BILL IS DOING. IS REALLY KEEPING CITIES AND COUNTIES THE HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT WE JUST HEARD SENATOR SKINNER SAID THAT'S WITH THREE THIRTY WAS DOING. IF WHAT THIS IS DOING IS MAKING EIGHTY USE MORE AFFORDABLE AND MORE ACCESSIBLE WITH US AT A LOCAL LEVEL WE JUST HEARD SENATOR WE CAL SKI SAY. THAT'S WHAT SB THIRTEEN INSTANTLY. AND WE DO KNOW THAT -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOM IN ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN. HAVE BILLS THAT HAVE PASSED OUT OF COMMITTEES IN THE SENATE WE DON'T NEED THIS BILL FOR OVER OF FOR EIGHTY USED AT ALL. OKAY SO LET'S EXAMINE WHAT'S LEFT OF THIS BILL WHAT IS IT DOING. AND I DON'T MEAN TO BE PARANOID BUT WITH CUTS IN A MAN'S LAST YEAR AND GOTTEN A MAN'S THIS YEAR ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IT'S ARGUABLY DOING. IS PROVIDING A VEHICLE FOR YET ANOTHER GUT AND AMEND IN AUGUST OR SEPTEMBER. THE COULD AGAIN SURPRISED ELECTRIC. AND I SUBMIT TO THIS COMMITTEE THAT THAT'S NOT AN APPROPRIATE THING TO PASS OUT INTO A PASSWORD. THE SECOND THING THAT IT IS DOING IS IT IS PROVIDING. ARGUMENT AND A LIMITATION ON BEDROOMS LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT FOR A MINUTE VERY FEW CITIES AND COUNTIES. SAY THAT THEY REGULATE THE NUMBER OF BEDROOMS. CERTAINLY NO CITY OR COUNTY SAID YOU CAN'T HAVE. FROM FEWER THAN THREE BEDROOMS THIS ISN'T AN ANTI FAMILY BILL WHAT MOST CITIES AND COUNTIES SAVES YOU CAN'T REDUCE A BEDROOM TO A TEN BY TEN DORM ROOM. STACK IT WITH BUNK BEDS. AND THEN RENT OUT BETS AS A CO HOME SHARING ARRANGEMENT WHICH REALLY CREATES DENSITY WHAT YOU HAVE IS YOU HAVE A LOT OF INDUSTRY THAT'S COMING IN PLACE IS CALLED UPSTART. THAT CITIES ARE TRYING TO LICENSE AND REGULATE BECAUSE ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU HAVE LEAGUE LIVE WORK ARRANGEMENTS AND LOW DENSITY RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS. WITH THE TRASH COLLECTION IN THE PARKING IN THE CITY SERVICES CAN'T KEEP UP WITH IT. OUR CITIES ARE TRYING TO DO THE ACT. WHAT BEDROOMS NUMBER OF BEDROOMS IS JUST NOT SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE REGULATED ONE SIZE FITS ALL FROM SACRAMENTO? I URGE YOU OKAY ESPECIALLY ON A GOTTEN THE MEN WERE A POLICY COMMITTEE HASN'T HAD A CHANCE TO REALLY LOOK AT THIS AND EXAMINE WHAT IT DOES ON A STATEWIDE BASIS. TO JUST SAY NO FINALLY THE DEFINITION OF LOWER DENSITY IS INCREDIBLY FAKE. IT CREATES NOW WITHOUT THE COMPENSATORY DAMAGES BECAUSE IT'S NOT AS BAD. BUT IT CREATES A REALLY VAGUE DEFINITION FOR A DEVELOPER TO COME IN AND ARGUE THAT WHAT YOU ARE DOING BUY EXTRA WIRES YEAR REQUIRING COMPLIANCE WITH SOMETHING COMPOSED AS A LOWER DENSITY. AND SO FOR ALL OF THESE REASONS I WOULD URGE THIS COMMITTEE TO STOP THIS BILL AS UNNECESSARY YOU'VE PASSED OUT THREE THIRTY YOU'VE PASSED OUT. THIRTEEN PLEASE STOP THIS ONE HERE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE A MOMENT I WANT TO LINE MY COMMENTS WITH THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU. MANAGERS MEMBERS SAID JASON RILEY CALIFORNIA CITIES WE HAVE AN IT WAS AWESOME IN A POSITION OF THE BILL CERTAINLY AGREE WITH WHAT HE BE APA MENTIONED -- BUT THE REMOVAL OF THE COMPENSATORY DAMAGES A BIG DEAL FOR US REALLY APPRECIATE THE SENATOR DOING THAT. TIME WAS CERTAINLY -- REEVALUATE OUR POSITION THANK YOU THANK YOU. KIANA VALENTINE ON BEHALF OF THE URBAN COUNTIES OF CALIFORNIA AT REITERATE OUR GRATITUDE FOR THE COMPENSATORY DAMAGES AMENDMENT AND I WOULD LIKE MY COMMENTS WITH A P. AS WELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. DAVID JONES ABOUT CITY SAN MARCUS WE APPRECIATE THE REMOVAL OF THE COMPENSATORY DAD DAMAGES WILL LOOK AT IT AND SEE IF WE CAN REMOVE OPPOSITION THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ENTER ENTRY ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF BEVERLY HILLS ECKEL OTHER THANKS ON THE AMENDMENT REMOVING THE COMPENSATORY DAMAGES WE'LL TAKE A LOOK NEVER LOOK AT THE BILL BUT I'M HERE TODAY. TO EXPRESS THE CITY'S OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON PETER PAPADOPOULOS WITH THE MISSION ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AGENCY IN SAN FRANCISCO WE APPRECIATE THE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS THROUGH AMENDMENTS INCLUDING TODAY WHICH WE SUPPORT WITHIN AN OPPOSE POSITION WE STILL ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE DISCUSSION OF POSSIBLY BRINGING BACK -- ESPECIALLY SOME OF OUR MOST CONCERNING ELEMENTS THAT WE HAVE HEARD SO WE ARE CONTINUING TO MONITOR THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ALEX GIVES HERE TODAY AND WE HAVE THE CITIES OF CUPERTINO LAFAYETTE AND WALNUT CREEK LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS AND WE WLL ONCE AGAIN ALIGN OUR COMMENTS OF PREVIOUS BECAUSE WELL. DAVID CAN TANA WITH L. AIDS HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION -- CURRENTLY OPPOSE BUT ONCE WE SEE THE A COMPENSATORY DAMAGE REMOVAL AND PRINT WE'RE PREPARED TO REMOVE OPPOSITION THANK THANK YOU. RECALL LIVABLE CALIFORNIA AND CULTURAL ACTION NETWORK STRONGLY OPPOSE [inaudible] THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE. FOREVER. HI THANK YOU SO MUCH -- I A YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS MY MY CITY DOESN'T ALWAYS DO HOUSING WELL BUT ONE THING WE DO WELL AS EIGHTY USE. AND WE ACTUALLY TRY TO GET EIGHTY USE AS PART OF A HABITAT FOR HUMANITY PROJECT. SO I APPRECIATE THE ADDITION OF EIGHTY YEARS INTO THIS BILL. YOU KNOW WHEN I WAS GOING THROUGH IT I THINK THE CENTER I HAD SEVERAL CONVERSATIONS. THE PERCEPTION OF THIS BILL IS IT. WHAT? DOES NOT ALLOW CITIES TO HAVE ANYMORE DISCRETIONARY PERMITTING PROCESS AND COULD YOU JUST. GO ON RECORD ABOUT THAT BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S CAUSING THAT YOU CAN I DON'T WHAT KNOW WHAT PART OF THE LANGUAGE BECAUSE OF THE CONFUSION BUT IF YOU COULD JUST. CLARIFY THAT FOR ON THE RECORD THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL. SURE THAT A MICROPHONE BACK -- YET THERE BUT A LOT OF THINGS SAID ABOUT THIS BILL SOME PEOPLE WHEN I INTRODUCED TO ANNOUNCED. THAT I HAD AMENDED SB FIFTY INTO THE SPELL SO THERE WERE SOME PEOPLE -- WHO -- DECIDED NOT TO READ THE BILL OR SOME PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY I THINK DELIBERATELY SPREAD MISINFORMATION TO THE LOT OF THINGS THAT I'VE BEEN SPREAD AROUND -- AROUND THIS BILL UNFORTUNATELY IT'S A PRETTY -- A DISCREET BILL THAT THAT SOME VERY SPECIFIC. THINGS THIS DOES NOT AND DISCRETIONARY PERMITTING. THE H. A CURRENTLY EXISTS AND REQUIRES CITIES TO ABIDE BY THEIR OWN. LOCALLY ADOPTED RULES THAT EXIST RIGHT NOW SO TO TO THE EXTENT THAT THAT LIMITS DISCRETION. THAT DISCRETION HAS BEEN LIMITED SINCE -- NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO THIS DOES NOT CHANGE THAT -- YOU I'M FOR EXAMPLE WE HEARD ABOUT THE THE BAY DEFINITION OF LOWER DENSITY THAT'S IN A THAT'S THE DEFINITION IN THE EXISTING HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT SO. IF PEOPLE COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE EXISTING A TODAY PEOPLE ARE ENTITLED TO THE COMPLAINTS BUT THAT'S NOT AN ISSUE -- WITH THIS BILL -- SO ALL WE'RE DOING IN THIS BILL IS MAKING CLARIFICATIONS ABOUT A FEW THINGS THAT. ARE INCLUDED IN THE HA WE'RE NOT CHANGING THE STANDARDS OF THE H. A.. THE OTHER THING -- IF YOU COULD ANSWER THIS QUESTION SUMMER IN IN MY IN MY CITIES NONE OF US HAVE PERMITTING -- OR ANY SPECIFICATIONS AROUND NUMBER OF BEDROOMS THAT'S NOT SOMETHING IN OUR ZONING -- SO IT'S CONFUSING I THINK TO SOME PEOPLE IN MY DISTRICT AND THEY READ IT BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THAT COULD YOU GO INTO WHY YOUR BILL TALK ABOUT THAT YES -- AND THERE ARE SOME CITIES THAT I SHOULD DO IN THEIR ZONING HAVE SAY A MINIMUM NUMBER OF BEDROOMS FOR EXAMPLE WANTING MORE FAMILY SIZE HOUSING -- SO THERE THERE ARE SOME CITIES THAT DO THAT -- BUT WHAT THE IN THIS BILL IT WOULD YES IF YOU HAPPEN TO HAVE AS YOU'RE REQUIRED TO BYE BYE -- BUT WHAT THE BUILT WITH IT'S DESIGNED TO GET AT IS THAT SOMETIMES FOR EXAMPLE. A PERSON MIGHT BE KNOWN FOR FOR UNITS -- AND BASED ON THE HI AND THE MASS ALLOWED BY LOCAL ZONING WHICH IT SAYS NOT OVERRIDE -- YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO BUILD FOR UNITS OUTSIDE OF NINE HUNDRED SQUARE FEET EACH. WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DISALLOWED MAYBE EACH OF THEM HAVING TWO BEDROOMS OR MAYBE THREE SO COMICAL ABOUT -- WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DISALLOW THAT THE CITY CAME BACK AND SAID YOU KNOW WHAT WE KNOW IS GOING TO FOR FOR UNITS WE KNOW WE SAID AX HI WE KNOW WE SAID THIS IS A STEP BACK REQUIRED? AND WE KNOW THAT THAT MEANS YOU CAN DO FOR UNITS AT NINE HUNDRED SQUARE FEET EACH. WE'RE GONNA REALLY ONLY ALLOW YOU FOR UNITS AT THREE HUNDRED SQUARE FEET EACH. BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT A FAMILY LIVING THERE WOULD PREFER TO HAVE A SINGLE PERSON LIVING THERE SO THE CITY WOULD HAVE OVER ROAD AND VIOLATED ITS OWN RULES. AND SO UNDER THE BUILDING CODE WHEN YOU HAVE -- A HOUSING UNIT OF ACTS FOOT PRINT ABOUT SUMMER SQUARE FEET. THE BUILDING CODE WILL DICTATE HOW MANY WHAT'S THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF BEDROOMS THAT YOU CAN. FIT THEIR CONSISTENT WITH THE HEALTH AND SAFETY AND AND THE BUILDING CODE THERE MIGHT BE ONE BEDROOM OR MIGHT BE. TWO THREE FOR WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE. AND ALL WE'RE SAYING IS WHATEVER YOU HAVE ZONE FOR WITH HIGH BALK AND DENSITY -- YOU NEED TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO PUT BEDROOMS AND CONSISTENT WITH THE BUILDING CODE UNDER THAT BOOK PRINT THAT YOU'VE ESTABLISHED LOCALLY -- AND THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. I DO APPRECIATE THOSE CLARIFICATIONS BECAUSE WHEN WHEN YOU READ THROUGH ESPECIALLY THE MEN AND A BILL THAT TAKES OUT THE THE THE LEGAL FEES THAT WAS THAT WAS A NO GO FOR FOR ME AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT. SO I'LL BE VOTING YESTERDAY AND YOU KNOW AS LONG AS IT STAYS THIS WAY I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONSIDER SOME SORT OF A MOMENT MAKES CLARIFICATIONS FOR WITH CITIES THAT DON'T HAVE THAT BEDROOM REQUIREMENT. I THINK THAT IS VERY CONFUSING FOR FOR FOLKS WHEN THEY READ IT SO MAYBE THAT'S SOMETHING YOU CAN CONSIDER. AND AS IT STAYS LIKE THIS OFF I GUESS ON THE FLOOR THANK YOU WILL GO BACK AND TAKE A LOOK AT THAT LANGUAGE MAKE SURE IT'S CLEAR. SO REMEMBER LACKEY. YES TO THE CHAIR IF I COULD JUST ASK A A QUESTION IF I COULD HAVE -- SANDY GEORGE COME BACK AND SPEAK TO THE ISSUE OF MINISTERIAL PERMITTING BECAUSE I I FEEL LIKE. THE GOOD SENATOR SENSE OF THE HAS MADE THAT CONFUSED ON SURE NOW WHAT THAT HAS. TO IT'S A VERY CRITICAL ISSUE VERY IMPORT PART OF THIS BILL FOR ME. YES I HAVE. YOU VOICE SOME CONCERN ABOUT THE MINISTERIAL PERMITTING AND IF YOU COULD JUST EXPAND ON THAT REAL QUICKLY AND HELP ME UNDERSTAND BECAUSE OF I'M GETTING KIND OF CONFLICTING INFORMATION FROM GOOD CENTER THERE. I DON'T THINK YEAH. I DON'T THINK WE'RE ON A DIFFERENT PAGE THERE I THINK IT'S THE WAY THE AMENDMENT WAS WRITTEN BECAUSE IT WAS SUPPOSED TO ACTUALLY MAKE SURE THAT THE PROJECTS THAT ARE SUBJECT THE HA IF THEY HAVE. MINISTERIAL PERMITS THAT THOSE MINISTERIALES PERMITS WOULD BE SUBJECT TO THE PENALTIES NATURE A IF THEY WERE VIOLENCE OF FOOD IF YOU DELAY THEM WE DON'T APPROVE THEM. THAT WOULD BE -- A VIOLATION UNDER THE HA AS IT IS NOW THOUGH YOU CAN'T SEPARATE BETWEEN MINISTERIAL PERMITS AND A PROJECT THAT HAS MISTER REAL PERMITS. SO ACTUALLY ADDS EVERY MINISTERIAL PERMIT ITSELF NO MATTER WHAT PROJECT INTO THE HA AND HA REQUIRES ANYTHING THAT YOU DO -- IMPOSE ON A DEVELOPMENT PROJECT TO HAVE EXTENSIVE ANALYSIS AND THOSE MINISTERIAL OF PERMITS ARE JUST A A CHECKLIST OF THINGS YOU CHECK THEM OFF. AND YOU GET THE PERMIT AT THE END OF THE PROCESS IT'S NOT REALLY DISCRETIONARY. VENTURE BY IF I MAY ADD TO THAT. AND WHAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH A P. AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TO MAKE SURE THE BILL IS DOING WHAT WE INTEND I BELIEVE IT PAYS DISTINGUISHING. BETWEEN LET THEM MINISTER A PERMIT FOR A LIKE FOR A PROJECT FOR EXAMPLE IN THERE LIKE IN SB THIRTY FIVE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. BIRTH IS SORT OF A MORE MINOR MINISTERIAL PERMIT SO WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH A PA -- TO TRY TO MAKE SURE TO SEE IF WE CAN -- OCT CLARIFY THE LANGUAGE AND JUST CLARIFY TO THAT UNDER THE HA THERE'S DIFFERENT CIVIL COLD PROCEDURES FOR MINISTERIAL DISCRETIONARY PER PERMITS -- AND ACTIONS AND YOU CAN'T COMBINE THE TWO JUST BY. TRYING TO DO THAT SO WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THOSE STILL ARE INTACT IN THEIR SEPARATE SO THAT ANY OTHER PRISONER AMENDMENT BUT WHERE THIS WILL COME INTO PLAY IS IF YOU GOT THE OF A PROJECT. THAT IS WITH THE HAS MINISTERIAL APPROVAL -- AND IF I IF OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT LET'S SAY IT'S JUST IN BAD FAITH SAID WE'RE NOT GIVE ME THE PERMIT EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE LEGALLY ENTITLED TO IT TO MINISTERIAL PERMIT FOR THE PROJECT. THEN THE HA COULD BE USED TO SAY WAIT YOU'VE VIOLATED THE RULES. SO SO WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH A PA ON THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE. ARE WE NEED A MOTION. HEY WE HAVE A MOTION BY. PHONE NUMBER ALMOST SECOND BY THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER VOEPEL. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND I APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION TODAY I I MEAN WE HEARD ONE OF EMPLOYMENTOPPONENTS OF THIS BILL WILL BOTH I'M NOT DO ANYTHING AND WILL DO EVERYTHING UNDER THE SUN. I THINK IT'S SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN.
