00:32:26.577 --> 00:32:29.247
FROM THE TREASURER'S PERSPECTIVE --

00:32:29.314 --> 00:32:31.516
IS DEPLOYED AND THEY MANAGE TO

00:32:31.582 --> 00:32:34.218
TRILLION DOLLARS OF BANKING

00:32:34.285 --> 00:32:36.054
TRANSACTIONS A YEAR NOW

00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:38.356
UTILIZING THE FISCAL SYSTEM.

00:32:38.423 --> 00:32:40.191
AND THAT IS WITH -- EIGHT LARGE

00:32:40.258 --> 00:32:44.195
BANKS AND ALL OF THE INTERNAL.

00:32:44.262 --> 00:32:46.831
BORROWING AND AND FINANCIAL

00:32:46.898 --> 00:32:49.000
TRANSACTIONS CASH TRANSACTIONS

00:32:49.067 --> 00:32:49.901
THAT HAPPENED IN THE SYSTEM.

00:32:49.967 --> 00:32:51.069
LIKE I SAID THERE'S A HUNDRED

00:32:51.135 --> 00:32:53.037
AND FIFTY TWO DEPARTMENTS AND

00:32:53.104 --> 00:32:54.005
THAT TRANSLATES INTO IN THE

00:32:54.072 --> 00:32:55.239
ACCOUNTING PIECE WHICH IS ALSO

00:32:55.306 --> 00:32:56.307
DEPLOYED THE DEPARTMENTAL

00:32:56.374 --> 00:32:57.475
ACCOUNTING PEACE HAS BEEN

00:32:57.542 --> 00:32:58.976
DEPLOYED TO THESE DEPARTMENTS.

00:32:59.043 --> 00:33:01.112
IT REPRESENTS THAT WE HAVE

00:33:01.179 --> 00:33:03.548
EIGHTEEN I'M CLOSER ACTUALLY.

00:33:03.614 --> 00:33:04.982
TO TWENTY THOUSAND END USERS

00:33:05.049 --> 00:33:06.617
UTILIZING THE SYSTEM TODAY.

00:33:06.684 --> 00:33:09.253
THAT REPRESENTS ABOUT 8% OF THE

00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:12.623
TOTAL STATE EMPLOYEE WORK FORCE.

00:33:12.690 --> 00:33:15.393
SO NOT ONLY IS FISCALE ONE OF

00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:17.195
THE LARGEST I. T. UNDERTAKINGS

00:33:17.261 --> 00:33:18.763
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:19.831
BUT WE HAVE FUNDAMENTALLY

00:33:19.897 --> 00:33:21.799
CHANGED THE WAY THAT CALIFORNIA

00:33:21.866 --> 00:33:23.735
DOES BUSINESS AND FUNDAMENTALLY

00:33:23.801 --> 00:33:26.237
CHANGE THE WAY EIGHTEEN THOUSAND

00:33:26.304 --> 00:33:27.405
END USERS DO THEIR DAY TO DAY

00:33:27.472 --> 00:33:29.707
WORK.

00:33:29.774 --> 00:33:32.310
SO -- IN THE OTHER SORRY THE

00:33:32.377 --> 00:33:33.478
OTHER PIECE OF FUNCTIONALITY

00:33:33.544 --> 00:33:34.579
THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN FULLY

00:33:34.645 --> 00:33:36.681
DEPLOYED IN CAME OUT IN TWENTY

00:33:36.748 --> 00:33:37.115
SIXTEEN OF COURSE.

00:33:37.181 --> 00:33:40.351
IS THE PROCUREMENT PIECE SO WE

00:33:40.418 --> 00:33:41.986
RETIRED THE LEGACY BID SYNC

00:33:42.053 --> 00:33:46.457
SYSTEM THAT CONTRACTORS UTILIZED --

00:33:46.524 --> 00:33:47.125
TO TO SELL GOODS AND SERVICES TO

00:33:47.191 --> 00:33:48.860
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND WE

00:33:48.926 --> 00:33:51.896
NOW UTILIZE -- CALLIE PROCURE

00:33:51.963 --> 00:33:54.232
WHICH IS A SYSTEM RUN OUT WITH.

00:33:54.298 --> 00:33:56.167
ON TOP OF THAT THE PEOPLE SOFT

00:33:56.234 --> 00:34:00.004
SYSTEM WE HAVE NINETY SEVEN

00:34:00.071 --> 00:34:00.571
THOUSAND VENDORS THAT SELL.

00:34:00.638 --> 00:34:01.239
GOODS AND SERVICES TO THE STATE

00:34:01.305 --> 00:34:02.507
OF CALIFORNIA.

00:34:02.573 --> 00:34:03.908
THROUGH THE DEPLOYMENT OF CALLIE

00:34:03.975 --> 00:34:06.577
PROCURE WE WERE ABLE TO WE THIS

00:34:06.644 --> 00:34:08.045
IS RIGHT AWAY MY MY PARTNER SAID

00:34:08.112 --> 00:34:10.515
TGS IN THIS CASE WAS ABLE TO

00:34:10.581 --> 00:34:13.818
CERTIFY SMALL BUSINESSES -- SB

00:34:13.885 --> 00:34:15.486
DVD SO DISABLE BUSINESS VETERAN

00:34:15.553 --> 00:34:18.189
ENTERPRISES UTILIZING THE SYSTEM

00:34:18.256 --> 00:34:19.457
SO THAT.

00:34:19.524 --> 00:34:23.561
IS AN EASE OF ARM AND BIGGER

00:34:23.628 --> 00:34:25.196
ACCESS POINT FOR THE SMALLER.

00:34:25.263 --> 00:34:26.631
COMPANIES AND SO THAT AGAIN IS

00:34:26.697 --> 00:34:29.867
SOMETHING THAT WE'RE INCREDIBLY --

00:34:29.934 --> 00:34:33.337
PROUD OF D. WITH RESPECT -- TO

00:34:33.404 --> 00:34:34.906
FUNCTIONALITY THAT WE'VE NEVER

00:34:34.972 --> 00:34:38.309
HAD BEFORE -- WE'VE HAD THE

00:34:38.376 --> 00:34:39.811
ABILITY SENSE THE SYSTEM HAS

00:34:39.877 --> 00:34:42.747
BEEN PUT IN PLACE. TO ENFORCE

00:34:42.814 --> 00:34:45.650
THE UNDERLYING RULES AND

00:34:45.716 --> 00:34:47.418
REGULATIONS THAT EXIST IN THE

00:34:47.485 --> 00:34:49.554
STATE WITH RESPECT TO ACCOUNTING

00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:51.122
BUDGETING AND AND OTHER

00:34:51.189 --> 00:34:52.490
FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT.

00:34:52.557 --> 00:34:54.625
SO THESE SYSTEM THAT DEPARTMENTS

00:34:54.692 --> 00:34:55.927
OPERATED IT AND YOU'RE WERE

00:34:55.993 --> 00:34:57.462

00:34:57.528 --> 00:34:58.763
ADMINISTRATIVE MANUAL OR OTHER

00:34:58.830 --> 00:35:01.566
REGULATION TO DO CERTAIN THINGS.

00:35:01.632 --> 00:35:03.167
BY COMBINING ALL OF THE SYSTEMS

00:35:03.234 --> 00:35:04.702
INTO A SINGLE INTEGRATED

00:35:04.769 --> 00:35:06.237
SOLUTION.

00:35:06.304 --> 00:35:08.039
THE DEPARTMENTS AT THE COMPUTER

00:35:08.105 --> 00:35:10.274
IS THAT CHECK FOR THE CONTROL

00:35:10.341 --> 00:35:11.876
AGENCIES SO BEFORE YOU CAN.

00:35:11.943 --> 00:35:13.744
MAKE AN EXPENDITURE OUT OF THE

00:35:13.811 --> 00:35:14.879
FISCAL SYSTEM.

00:35:14.946 --> 00:35:16.647
THE SYSTEM TAX DO YOU HAVE

00:35:16.714 --> 00:35:18.015
APPROPRIATIONS AUTHORITY.

00:35:18.082 --> 00:35:19.617
YOU'RE ALWAYS SUPPOSED TO SPEND

00:35:19.684 --> 00:35:20.651
ONLY IF YOU HAVE A PREPARATION

00:35:20.718 --> 00:35:21.919
PRETTY BUT THE THE BUT THE

00:35:21.986 --> 00:35:23.254
COMPUTER IS NOT FORGIVING.

00:35:23.321 --> 00:35:24.422
THEN WHEN YOU GO TO ACTUALLY

00:35:24.489 --> 00:35:26.524
MAKE AN EXPENDITURE DO YOU HAVE

00:35:26.591 --> 00:35:27.692
CASH IN THAT ACCOUNT.

00:35:27.758 --> 00:35:29.293
AT THIS MOMENT WHEN THE MONEY

00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:31.529
NEEDS TO BE THERE AGAIN THOSE

00:35:31.596 --> 00:35:32.096
ARE THINGS THAT ARE IN THE

00:35:32.163 --> 00:35:33.331
SYSTEM.

00:35:33.397 --> 00:35:36.534
SOME OF THE STRUGGLES THAT --

00:35:36.601 --> 00:35:37.869
WE'VE HAD. FOR SOME OF THE

00:35:37.935 --> 00:35:40.204
DEPARTMENTS.

00:35:40.271 --> 00:35:42.807
OUR OUR INTO THAT FACT THAT SOME

00:35:42.874 --> 00:35:45.810
OF THESE RESPONSIBILITIES THAT

00:35:45.877 --> 00:35:47.445
THEY NEEDED TO BE DOING.

00:35:47.512 --> 00:35:48.980
ARE NOW ALL HAPPENING IN REAL

00:35:49.046 --> 00:35:51.682
TIME IN IN THIS SINGLE SYSTEM SO

00:35:51.749 --> 00:35:54.485
YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD -- I DID A

00:35:54.552 --> 00:35:56.120
DAY DELAY BETWEEN WHEN YOU

00:35:56.187 --> 00:35:58.189
YOU'RE RIGHT YOUR CHECK TO WHEN

00:35:58.256 --> 00:36:00.358
IT GETS DEPOSITED -- OR CASH IT

00:36:00.424 --> 00:36:02.560
AND THAT'S NOT THE CASE SO MUCH

00:36:02.627 --> 00:36:04.362
AND AND NOT FISCAL TODAY SO IT'S

00:36:04.428 --> 00:36:08.332
MORE REAL TIME AND THEREFORE.

00:36:08.399 --> 00:36:10.668
AS THERE IS THAT UP FRONT WORK

00:36:10.735 --> 00:36:11.435
AND ACCOUNTABILITY THAT IS

00:36:11.502 --> 00:36:13.170
HAPPENING.

00:36:13.237 --> 00:36:15.072
I 98% OF ALL OF THE

00:36:15.139 --> 00:36:17.008
FUNCTIONALITY THAT WE SET OUT TO

00:36:17.074 --> 00:36:17.842
BUILD.

00:36:17.909 --> 00:36:20.111
HAS BEEN BUILT.

00:36:20.177 --> 00:36:21.546
THE REMAINING FUNCTIONALITY

00:36:21.612 --> 00:36:24.448
WRITTEN REMAINS AROUND TO THE

00:36:24.515 --> 00:36:26.117
CASH BOOK OF RECORDS SO THE

00:36:26.183 --> 00:36:28.786
LEGACY -- SYSTEM AT THE AT THE

00:36:28.853 --> 00:36:29.887
STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE WHICH

00:36:29.954 --> 00:36:31.389
DOES THE CASH ACCOUNTING FOR THE

00:36:31.455 --> 00:36:32.523
STATE.

00:36:32.590 --> 00:36:35.059
NEEDS TO BE HAVE REPLICATED

00:36:35.126 --> 00:36:36.827
ALLEN TO PUT INTO A FIST CAL AND

00:36:36.894 --> 00:36:38.763
THAT IS WHAT WE WILL BE DOING IN

00:36:38.829 --> 00:36:39.897
THIS NEXT YEAR.

00:36:39.964 --> 00:36:42.900
WE DIVIDED IT THE INTEGRATED WE

00:36:42.967 --> 00:36:46.771
DIVIDED THE ASIO RELEASE IN. TWO

00:36:46.837 --> 00:36:48.372
FIVE MAJOR MILESTONES.

00:36:48.439 --> 00:36:50.374
AND THIS WAS AFTER SEVERAL YEARS

00:36:50.441 --> 00:36:51.509
OF US.

00:36:51.576 --> 00:36:53.144
TRYING TO DO TO FIGURE OUT THE

00:36:53.210 --> 00:36:55.012
BEST WAY TO BRING ON ALL OF THE

00:36:55.079 --> 00:36:57.448
FUNCTIONALITY THE COMPTROLLER'S

00:36:57.515 --> 00:36:59.417
WE HAD MANY MEETINGS ALONG THE

00:36:59.483 --> 00:37:00.985
WAY AND ULTIMATELY THE FOUR

00:37:01.052 --> 00:37:03.421
PARTNERS DECIDED THAT.

00:37:03.487 --> 00:37:05.556
INSTEAD OF DOING A YOU KNOW

00:37:05.623 --> 00:37:06.891
BANDAID RIPOFF THE BAND AID

00:37:06.958 --> 00:37:07.959
APPROACH AND CUTTING OVER THE

00:37:08.025 --> 00:37:09.660
BOOK OF RECORD IN ALL OF THEIR

00:37:09.727 --> 00:37:10.861
OTHER FUNCTIONALITY ALL ONCE.

00:37:10.928 --> 00:37:12.196
WE DEVELOP SOMETHING CALLED THE

00:37:12.263 --> 00:37:13.965
INTEGRATED SOLUTION WHERE WE'RE

00:37:14.031 --> 00:37:14.999
INTERFACING.

00:37:15.066 --> 00:37:16.534
OUR SYSTEM WITH THE LEGACY

00:37:16.601 --> 00:37:19.203
SYSTEM SO THAT WE CAN COMPARE --

00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:21.372
IN ON A DAILY BASIS WHAT THOSE

00:37:21.439 --> 00:37:23.541
NUMBERS ARE AND MAKING SURE THAT

00:37:23.608 --> 00:37:24.909
EVERYTHING IS FULLY TESTED

00:37:24.976 --> 00:37:26.410
BEFORE WE START TURNING OFF THE

00:37:26.477 --> 00:37:28.613
LEGACY SYSTEM FUNCTIONALITY AT

00:37:28.679 --> 00:37:29.814
THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE.

00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:31.282
SO AGAIN THE ONLY PIECES THAT

00:37:31.349 --> 00:37:33.351
ARE LEFT TO DEPLOY AND THAT

00:37:33.417 --> 00:37:34.418
REALLY ARE AROUND THE CASH

00:37:34.485 --> 00:37:35.086
MANAGEMENT.

00:37:35.152 --> 00:37:37.121
WE HAVE WE ARE QUITE A WAYS DOWN

00:37:37.188 --> 00:37:38.889
IN THE BUILDING.

00:37:38.956 --> 00:37:40.324
BUT BECAUSE AGAIN.

00:37:40.391 --> 00:37:41.459
IT.

00:37:41.525 --> 00:37:43.894
HAS A REQUIREMENT TO BE RELEASED

00:37:43.961 --> 00:37:44.895
ON THE BEGINNING A FISCAL YEAR

00:37:44.962 --> 00:37:46.497
TO HAVE TO GO JULY.

00:37:46.564 --> 00:37:47.865
ONE I CAN'T DO IT IN THE FIRST

00:37:47.932 --> 00:37:49.533
QUARTER THE SECOND QUARTER EVEN

00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:50.901
THOUGH WE MIGHT BE READY TO

00:37:50.968 --> 00:37:53.270
DEPLOY IT HAS TO COINCIDE WITH

00:37:53.337 --> 00:37:53.904
THE WITH THE CALENDAR YEAR SO

00:37:53.971 --> 00:37:54.739
THAT.

00:37:54.805 --> 00:37:57.074
THAT PIECE OF WORK IS IS AGAIN --

00:37:57.141 --> 00:37:58.576
WORKING VERY WELL WITH WITH THE

00:37:58.643 --> 00:38:00.144
COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE AND THEIR

00:38:00.211 --> 00:38:01.879
THEIR STAFF IN MAKING SURE THAT.

00:38:01.946 --> 00:38:03.781
IT IS BUILT BUT THEN IT IS ALSO

00:38:03.848 --> 00:38:06.050
FULLY TESTED AND VALIDATED

00:38:06.117 --> 00:38:09.053
BEFORE WE PUT IT INTO PRODUCTION

00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:10.521
FOR THE REST OF THE STATE.

00:38:10.588 --> 00:38:14.825
AND IN THE FINAL PIECE THAT IS

00:38:14.892 --> 00:38:15.559
LEFT TO BUILD.

00:38:15.626 --> 00:38:17.762
IS THE KAFFIR WHICH IS THE OKAY

00:38:17.828 --> 00:38:18.629
I HAVE TO ALWAYS READ THE

00:38:18.696 --> 00:38:19.263
COMPREHENSIVE ANNUAL FINANCIAL

00:38:19.330 --> 00:38:20.765
REPORT FOR THE STATE OF

00:38:20.831 --> 00:38:21.866
CALIFORNIA.

00:38:21.932 --> 00:38:24.635
AND IT IS A KEY DOCUMENT THAT IS

00:38:24.702 --> 00:38:26.070
UTILIZED BY.

00:38:26.137 --> 00:38:27.471
BY THE RATING AGENCIES BUT ALSO

00:38:27.538 --> 00:38:29.106
BY OTHER INVESTORS AND STATE

00:38:29.173 --> 00:38:31.709
CALIFORNIA AND SO -- IT IS A KEY

00:38:31.776 --> 00:38:33.377
AN IMPORTANT DOCUMENT TO US AND

00:38:33.444 --> 00:38:35.112
WE WILL BE CONTINUING THAT BUILD

00:38:35.179 --> 00:38:37.048
AND DEPLOYMENT AS WELL IN THIS

00:38:37.114 --> 00:38:38.916
YEAR.

00:38:38.983 --> 00:38:39.784
SO HAVING SAID THAT ABOUT THE

00:38:39.850 --> 00:38:41.886
SYSTEM I WANT TO SHIFT A LITTLE

00:38:41.952 --> 00:38:43.554
BIT TO THE ACTUAL USE OF THE

00:38:43.621 --> 00:38:44.321
SYSTEM.

00:38:44.388 --> 00:38:45.623
SO HOW ARE THE DEPARTMENTS THE

00:38:45.690 --> 00:38:46.557
HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO

00:38:46.624 --> 00:38:47.658
DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE IN THE

00:38:47.725 --> 00:38:49.627
SYSTEM HOW ARE THEY THE FAIRING.

00:38:49.694 --> 00:38:51.962
SO FIRST -- ONE OF THE THE

00:38:52.029 --> 00:38:53.497
ISSUES THAT HAS COME UP IN THE

00:38:53.564 --> 00:38:56.467
CASF A AS WELL AS THE I PO AS

WELL AS IN -- THE CONTROLLERS

00:38:58.703 --> 00:38:59.737
LETTER WAS THAT.

00:38:59.804 --> 00:39:01.172
THAT WOULD WE NEED TO NOT BRING

00:39:01.238 --> 00:39:02.540
ON ANYMORE DEPARTMENTS UNTIL

00:39:02.606 --> 00:39:04.008
WE'VE WE'VE KIND OF STATE LAST.

00:39:04.075 --> 00:39:05.342
ONE HAPPY TO SAY THAT ALL OF THE

00:39:05.409 --> 00:39:06.744
DEPARTMENTS ARE ON THAT WE HAD

00:39:06.811 --> 00:39:08.946
INTENDED TO DO SO THAT IT WAS

00:39:09.013 --> 00:39:10.448
KIND OF A TIMING ISSUE WHEN WHEN

00:39:10.514 --> 00:39:11.716
WE GOT THAT LETTER WHEN WE WE

00:39:11.782 --> 00:39:13.250
DEPLOYED ALL OF THE DEPARTMENTS.

00:39:13.317 --> 00:39:14.919
THE REMAINING DEPARTMENTS ON

00:39:14.985 --> 00:39:16.454
JULY.

00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:17.054
ONE TWENTY NINETEEN NOW THIS

00:39:17.121 --> 00:39:20.357
DEPLOYMENT EFFORT WAS VERY --

00:39:20.424 --> 00:39:24.328
JULY ONE TWENTY EIGHTEEN SORRY

00:39:24.395 --> 00:39:26.230
WE'RE NOT THERE YET -- IS THAT

00:39:26.297 --> 00:39:26.864
THIS EFFORT WAS DIFFERENT THAN

00:39:26.931 --> 00:39:27.498
SOME OF OUR OTHER ON BOARDING

00:39:27.565 --> 00:39:30.835
EFFORTS IN THAT THIS REMAINING

00:39:30.901 --> 00:39:31.869
SIXTY FOUR I DIDN'T HAVE ANOTHER

00:39:31.936 --> 00:39:33.437
CO COURTED DEPARTMENTS. TO DO

00:39:33.504 --> 00:39:35.840
THE CHANGE MANAGEMENT AND THE

00:39:35.906 --> 00:39:37.742
TASKS THAT ARE INVOLVED IN

00:39:37.808 --> 00:39:39.610
BRINGING THEM ON SO I WAS ABLE

00:39:39.677 --> 00:39:41.545
TO TAKE MY STAFF IN BED THEM

00:39:41.612 --> 00:39:42.379
WITH SOME OF THE LARGER

00:39:42.446 --> 00:39:43.748
DEPARTMENTS THE MORE COMPLICATED

00:39:43.814 --> 00:39:44.915
DEPARTMENTS.

00:39:44.982 --> 00:39:45.916
AND WORK WITH THEM SO THAT THEY

00:39:45.983 --> 00:39:48.085
COULD HAVE AN EASIER ON BOARDING

00:39:48.152 --> 00:39:49.620
THAN WE'VE EXPERIENCED IN THE

00:39:49.687 --> 00:39:50.588
PAST.

00:39:50.654 --> 00:39:52.389
THIS HAS PAID DIVIDENDS IN THAT

00:39:52.456 --> 00:39:54.058
MANY OF THE LARGER DEPARTMENTS

00:39:54.125 --> 00:39:56.227
THAT WE MADE THAT INVESTMENT IN

00:39:56.293 --> 00:39:57.428
UP FRONT.

00:39:57.495 --> 00:40:00.698
HAS BEEN ABLE -- TO KEEP UP WITH

00:40:00.765 --> 00:40:03.367
THEIR MINDS AND AT IS ARE

00:40:03.434 --> 00:40:04.602
FURTHER ALONG IN IN BETTER SHAPE

00:40:04.668 --> 00:40:05.503
THAN WHAT WE'VE SEEN AT THIS

00:40:05.569 --> 00:40:07.238
POINT IN TIME FOR PREVIOUS

00:40:07.304 --> 00:40:08.172
RELEASES.

00:40:08.239 --> 00:40:09.406
NOW ONE DEPARTMENT THAT STICKS

00:40:09.473 --> 00:40:12.109
OUT IN MY MIND IS CAL FIRE AND

00:40:12.176 --> 00:40:13.010
AGAIN WHEN I SAY WE

00:40:13.077 --> 00:40:15.179
INDIVIDUALIZED AND WE WERE ABLE

00:40:15.246 --> 00:40:16.514
WE HAVE THE CAPACITY BECAUSE WE

00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:18.382
WEREN'T WORKING ON BRINGING ON

00:40:18.449 --> 00:40:19.784
THE NEXT CULL COURT.

00:40:19.850 --> 00:40:21.585
WE WERE ABLE TO PROVIDE THEM

00:40:21.652 --> 00:40:22.753
THERE AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT

00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:25.156
TEAM AND KNOWING THAT JULY ONE

00:40:25.222 --> 00:40:26.824
MIGHT BE THE ABSOLUTE BEST TIME

00:40:26.891 --> 00:40:28.259
TO CUT OVER FOR FINANCIAL

00:40:28.325 --> 00:40:29.126
RECORDS.

00:40:29.193 --> 00:40:31.061
IT IS ONE OF THE ABSOLUTE WORST

00:40:31.128 --> 00:40:31.996
TIMES FOR THE STATE OF

00:40:32.062 --> 00:40:34.365
CALIFORNIA -- TO MOVE THAT THE

00:40:34.431 --> 00:40:35.533
DEPARTMENT OF FORESTRY AND FIRE

00:40:35.599 --> 00:40:37.334
PROTECTION SO THEY'RE IN THE THE

00:40:37.401 --> 00:40:39.537
HEAT OF THE FIRE SEASON -- AND

00:40:39.603 --> 00:40:41.138
AND DOING THIS CHANGE MANAGEMENT

00:40:41.205 --> 00:40:42.373
IN THE MIDDLE WHEN THEY NEED TO

00:40:42.439 --> 00:40:44.475
BE ABLE TO PAY THEIR BILLS.

00:40:44.542 --> 00:40:45.075
IT IT YOU KNOW WHEN THEY'RE

00:40:45.142 --> 00:40:47.244
EXPEDITED FASHION AND NOT HAVE

00:40:47.311 --> 00:40:48.746
THIS THIS CHANGE AND ROB THEM.

00:40:48.813 --> 00:40:50.147
SO WE DID A CONVERSION WITH THEM

00:40:50.214 --> 00:40:52.783
AND THEN IN JANUARY THEY STARTED

00:40:52.850 --> 00:40:54.385
TRANSACTING IN THE SYSTEM.

00:40:54.451 --> 00:40:55.519
SO WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BRING

00:40:55.586 --> 00:40:56.854
THEM.

00:40:56.921 --> 00:40:59.456
ALONG WITH US WORKING WITH THEM

00:40:59.523 --> 00:41:00.324
THEY'VE HAD AN INCREDIBLE

00:41:00.391 --> 00:41:02.026
COMMITMENT AND I I JUST I DO

00:41:02.092 --> 00:41:05.262
HAVE TO SING THE PRAISES OF OF

00:41:05.329 --> 00:41:05.930
CAL FIRE.

00:41:05.996 --> 00:41:06.797
BECAUSE IT WAS THIS MUTUAL

00:41:06.864 --> 00:41:08.032
UNDERSTANDING OF HOW IMPORTANT

00:41:08.098 --> 00:41:09.466
THEIR CORE FUNCTIONS WORK AND

00:41:09.533 --> 00:41:10.434
WHAT WE NEEDED TO DO TO MAKE

00:41:10.501 --> 00:41:12.002
SURE THEY WERE ABLE TO NOT MISS

00:41:12.069 --> 00:41:15.639
A BEAT WHEN THEY CAME ON TO OUR

00:41:15.706 --> 00:41:16.240
SYSTEM.

00:41:16.307 --> 00:41:17.107
I'M HAPPY TO SAY THAT THEY ARE

00:41:17.174 --> 00:41:17.741
ONE OF THE DEPARTMENTS THAT IS

00:41:17.808 --> 00:41:19.343
CURRENT SO THEY HAVE CLOSED NINE

00:41:19.410 --> 00:41:20.211
MONTHS OUT OF THE NINE MONTHS

00:41:20.277 --> 00:41:21.812
WE'RE EXPECTED TO HAVE CLOSED AT

00:41:21.879 --> 00:41:24.215
THIS POINT IN TIME -- AND I WILL

00:41:24.281 --> 00:41:25.349
YOU KNOW IGNORE ALL AGE THAT

00:41:25.416 --> 00:41:26.650
THEY'VE ONLY RECONCILED TO OF

00:41:26.717 --> 00:41:28.285
THOSE MONTHS BUT AGAIN THAT

00:41:28.352 --> 00:41:29.587
HAPPENS IT'S AN ACCOUNTING

00:41:29.653 --> 00:41:31.488
ACTIVITY OUTSIDE OF THE FISCAL

00:41:31.555 --> 00:41:32.756
SYSTEM.

00:41:32.823 --> 00:41:35.192
THAT THEY DO -- ON THEIR OWN OR

00:41:35.259 --> 00:41:37.294
WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF SAY THAT

00:41:37.361 --> 00:41:39.296
THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE.

00:41:39.363 --> 00:41:41.465
ADDITIONAL PAIN POINTS THAT THE

00:41:41.532 --> 00:41:43.901
DEPARTMENTS HAVE HAD.

00:41:43.968 --> 00:41:45.502
IS DETAILS.

00:41:45.569 --> 00:41:47.438
SO INSTEAD OF DOING ON A HIGH

00:41:47.504 --> 00:41:50.507
LEVEL HAS SINGLE CLAIM AUDIT FOR

00:41:50.574 --> 00:41:52.276
UP -- FOR SINGLE CLAIM FOR A LOT

00:41:52.343 --> 00:41:55.112
OF INVOICES THEY'RE HAVING TO DO

00:41:55.179 --> 00:41:56.046
IT LINE ITEM.

00:41:56.113 --> 00:41:58.382
SO EACH LINE OF AN INVOICE GETS

00:41:58.449 --> 00:41:59.683
ENTERED INTO THE SYSTEM.

00:41:59.750 --> 00:42:00.918
AND THE REASON THAT IS IS

00:42:00.985 --> 00:42:03.454
BECAUSE THIS IS.

00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:05.489
THE AMOUNT OF TRANSPARENCY THAT

00:42:05.556 --> 00:42:07.157
WAS ONE OF THE KEY GOALS OF THE

00:42:07.224 --> 00:42:08.692
FISCAL SYSTEM.

00:42:08.759 --> 00:42:11.195
REQUIRES THAT -- THAT IN ORDER

00:42:11.262 --> 00:42:12.529
FOR US TO BE ABLE TO KNOW HOW

00:42:12.596 --> 00:42:14.131
MUCH WE'RE SPENDING ON ON ON

00:42:14.198 --> 00:42:17.067
CRITICAL AREAS WE NEED TO HAVE

00:42:17.134 --> 00:42:17.234
IT.

00:42:17.301 --> 00:42:19.103
CAPTURED THAT WAY.

00:42:19.169 --> 00:42:21.839
THE FLIP SIDE OF THAT COIN IS DO

00:42:21.906 --> 00:42:23.841
WE COLLECT -- YOU KNOW DO WE

00:42:23.908 --> 00:42:25.209
NEED TO KNOW THAT THE PRISONS

00:42:25.276 --> 00:42:26.343
ARE BUYING.

00:42:26.410 --> 00:42:27.945
GALA APPLES OR GRANNY SMITH

00:42:28.012 --> 00:42:29.380
APPLES OR DO I NEED TO KNOW THAT

00:42:29.446 --> 00:42:30.281
THEY'RE BUYING FOR IT.

00:42:30.347 --> 00:42:31.949
AND SO THIS IS A POLICY

00:42:32.016 --> 00:42:33.317
DISCUSSION THAT IS HAPPENING

00:42:33.384 --> 00:42:34.818
RIGHT NOW BETWEEN THE STATE

00:42:34.885 --> 00:42:35.619
COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE IN THE

00:42:35.686 --> 00:42:36.921
DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES

00:42:36.987 --> 00:42:38.455
AND THEY'RE WORKING ON WHAT IS

00:42:38.522 --> 00:42:40.457
THE RIGHT LEVEL OF DETAIL TO BE

00:42:40.524 --> 00:42:40.724
CAPTURED.

00:42:40.791 --> 00:42:41.892
AND SO THAT.

00:42:41.959 --> 00:42:43.060
IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK IS YOU

00:42:43.127 --> 00:42:44.428
KNOW MORE PERFECT FOR THAT THE

00:42:44.495 --> 00:42:45.629
SECOND PANEL BUT THOSE ARE THE

00:42:45.696 --> 00:42:46.797
TYPES OF ISSUES THAT ARE

00:42:46.864 --> 00:42:48.198
DEFINITELY DRIVING ADDITIONAL

00:42:48.265 --> 00:42:51.368
WORK. FOR THE DEPARTMENTS AND ON

00:42:51.435 --> 00:42:52.636
THE FLIP SIDE THE ADDITIONAL

00:42:52.703 --> 00:42:54.738
WORKON THE CONTROL AGENCY SIDE

00:42:54.805 --> 00:42:55.639
IS THAT.

00:42:55.706 --> 00:42:59.043
AGAIN WHEN WE WERE WE WOULD SEND

00:42:59.109 --> 00:43:01.078
AND WE GET IT RIGHT BE

00:43:01.145 --> 00:43:04.081
CONSIDERATE WE WOULD HAVE A SO

00:43:04.148 --> 00:43:06.050
BASICALLY IF A CONSOLIDATED --

00:43:06.116 --> 00:43:08.752
DEPOSIT NOW THE DEPOSITS FOR

00:43:08.819 --> 00:43:10.754
EACH DEPARTMENT ARE EACH

00:43:10.821 --> 00:43:12.122
TRANSACTION HAVE ITS OWN LINE

00:43:12.189 --> 00:43:13.557
ITEM IN THERE SO WHERE'S THE

00:43:13.624 --> 00:43:15.159
CONTROLLERS WORKLOAD WENT FROM

00:43:15.225 --> 00:43:17.061
OKAY WE'VE GOT THIS DEPOSIT OF A

00:43:17.127 --> 00:43:17.861
MILLION DOLLARS INTO THIS HIGH

00:43:17.928 --> 00:43:19.129
LEVEL ACCOUNT.

00:43:19.196 --> 00:43:20.431
BECAUSE AGAIN THE CONTROLLERS AT

00:43:20.497 --> 00:43:22.166
A MUCH HIGHER LEVEL OF REPORTING

00:43:22.232 --> 00:43:23.734
IN THE FISCAL SYSTEM WANTED THIS

00:43:23.801 --> 00:43:25.069
MORE DETAILED LEVEL.

00:43:25.135 --> 00:43:26.603
WE'RE NOW REQUIRING THEM TO COME

00:43:26.670 --> 00:43:27.838
TO PUT THE INFORMATION IN A

00:43:27.905 --> 00:43:30.107
DETAILED LEVEL THERE BY DRIVING

00:43:30.174 --> 00:43:32.309
WORK -- EFFORT AT THE STATE

00:43:32.376 --> 00:43:33.744
COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE AS OTHERS

00:43:33.811 --> 00:43:34.445
THAT BACK LAW.

00:43:34.511 --> 00:43:35.646
AND SO WE HAVE BEEN PARTNERING

00:43:35.713 --> 00:43:36.714
WITH THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S

00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:39.149
OFFICE TO LOOK AT THAT WORK FLOW

00:43:39.216 --> 00:43:41.452
AND LOOK AT WAYS THAT WE CAN.

00:43:41.518 --> 00:43:42.886
MEET THEIR NEEDS TO MAKE SURE

00:43:42.953 --> 00:43:43.887
THAT WE'RE HITTING THE RIGHT

00:43:43.954 --> 00:43:45.122
FUNDS AND THAT THEY HAVE THE

00:43:45.189 --> 00:43:46.256
RIGHT LEVEL OF OVERSIGHT.

00:43:46.323 --> 00:43:51.128
WITHOUT BEING AN UNDUE BURDEN ON

00:43:51.195 --> 00:43:51.729
THE ADDITIONAL WORK THAT THEY

00:43:51.795 --> 00:43:52.262
HAVE.

00:43:52.329 --> 00:43:53.731
SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE THE THE

00:43:53.797 --> 00:43:54.631
ISSUES THAT WE HEAR ABOUT FROM

00:43:54.698 --> 00:43:57.401
THE DEPARTMENTS -- THEN WE ALSO

00:43:57.468 --> 00:43:59.670
HEAR SOME CONCERNS FROM.

00:43:59.737 --> 00:44:02.339
FROM VENDORS.

00:44:02.406 --> 00:44:03.540
SO THIS HAS BEEN SOMETHING THAT

00:44:03.607 --> 00:44:05.009
WHEN I'VE I'VE BEEN ON THE

00:44:05.075 --> 00:44:06.877
PROJECT FOR ABOUT FOUR YEARS NOW.

00:44:06.944 --> 00:44:08.045
I WHEN I FIRST CAME ON WE HAD

00:44:08.112 --> 00:44:10.614
JUST.

00:44:10.681 --> 00:44:12.816
RELEASE WE HAD ABOUT THIRTY OR

00:44:12.883 --> 00:44:14.518
FORTY DEPARTMENTS IN IN THAT

00:44:14.585 --> 00:44:16.153
THIS IS NEVER THE SMALLER ONES

00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:16.987
THEY WERE THE ONES THAT WERE

00:44:17.054 --> 00:44:20.391
BOARD MEMBERS AND HAD -- USUALLY

00:44:20.457 --> 00:44:21.792
OTHER DEPARTMENTS EITHER HELPING

00:44:21.859 --> 00:44:22.893
THEM WITH THEIR BOOKS OR NOT.

00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:23.861
BUT I WAS CALLED IN FRONT OF A

00:44:23.927 --> 00:44:25.329
LEGISLATURE A COUPLE OF TIMES AS

00:44:25.396 --> 00:44:27.231
WELL AS IN FRONT OF THE

00:44:27.297 --> 00:44:27.865
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE TO EXPLAIN --

00:44:27.931 --> 00:44:28.799
CABLE.

00:44:28.866 --> 00:44:29.867
I'VE GOT BOARD MEMBERS THAT ARE

00:44:29.933 --> 00:44:31.402
GETTING PAID.

00:44:31.468 --> 00:44:32.803
AND I BRING THIS EXAMPLE UP

00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:34.204
BECAUSE I THINK THAT THIS IS A

00:44:34.271 --> 00:44:35.706
SUCCESS OF FISCALE. ONE OF THE

00:44:35.773 --> 00:44:37.307
REQUIREMENTS TO GET PAID FROM

00:44:37.374 --> 00:44:38.242
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS THAT

00:44:38.308 --> 00:44:39.676
YOU HAVE THE APPROPRIATE TAX

00:44:39.743 --> 00:44:41.011
INFORMATION.

00:44:41.078 --> 00:44:42.346
RECORDED WITH THE STATE SO WE

00:44:42.413 --> 00:44:44.281
KNOW HOW.

00:44:44.348 --> 00:44:46.784
TO ISSUE YOUR TEN NINETY NINE OR

00:44:46.850 --> 00:44:48.919
YOUR W. TWO OR WHATEVER YOU THE

00:44:48.986 --> 00:44:50.721
RIGHT TAX DOCUMENT IS.

00:44:50.788 --> 00:44:51.355
SO WE CALL THAT IT'S YOU KNOW

00:44:51.422 --> 00:44:54.224
IT'S A STANDARD TWO OH FOUR FORM.

00:44:54.291 --> 00:44:55.859
WE FOUND THAT WHEN WE

00:44:55.926 --> 00:44:56.994
IMPLEMENTED FISCALE.

00:44:57.061 --> 00:44:58.595
THERE WERE A LOT OF VENDORS

00:44:58.662 --> 00:45:01.432
INCLUDING MEMBERS THAT WERE PART

00:45:01.498 --> 00:45:02.533
TIME MEMBERS ON BOARD CHECK OUT

00:45:02.599 --> 00:45:04.935
PER DIEM THEY DIDN'T HAVE THESE

00:45:05.002 --> 00:45:06.336
THIS INFORMATION ON FILE.

00:45:06.403 --> 00:45:08.338

ATTENTION KIND OF THIS

00:56:18.374 --> 00:56:20.710
FUNDAMENTAL DISCONNECT ABOUT THE

00:56:20.777 --> 00:56:22.846
DEFINITION OF DEPLOYED AND WHAT

00:56:22.912 --> 00:56:24.614
THAT ACTUALLY MEANS SO NOT AS

00:56:24.681 --> 00:56:25.682
OTHER SAID ACCORDING TO THE

00:56:25.749 --> 00:56:26.883
PROJECT OFFICE.

00:56:26.950 --> 00:56:28.752
IMPLEMENTED MEANS SYSTEM IS

00:56:28.818 --> 00:56:30.286
READY TO USE AND THE ENTITY HAS

00:56:30.353 --> 00:56:31.721
A STARTING POINT FOR RECORDING

00:56:31.788 --> 00:56:33.123
TRANSACTIONS.

00:56:33.189 --> 00:56:35.792
IMPLEMENTED DOES NOT MEAN THAT

00:56:35.859 --> 00:56:37.861
ENTITIES HAVE TRANSITION FOR

00:56:37.927 --> 00:56:39.162
LEGACY SYSTEMS TO PASCAL NOR

00:56:39.229 --> 00:56:40.563
DOES IT MEAN THAT USERS WITH IN

00:56:40.630 --> 00:56:42.799
THOSE ENTITIES ARE FULLY TRAINED

00:56:42.866 --> 00:56:44.868
DOT TRANSACTION ARE CONDUCTING

00:56:44.934 --> 00:56:46.469
THE STATE'S BUSINESS.

00:56:46.536 --> 00:56:47.704
WITH BEST GAL SO I THINK WHEN I

00:56:49.305 --> 00:56:51.107
PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY USING IT.

00:56:51.174 --> 00:56:52.942
WHEN YOU SAY FULLY DEPLOYED?

00:56:53.009 --> 00:56:54.844
WHAT DO YOU ACTUALLY MEAN SO AT

00:56:54.911 --> 00:56:56.713
THIS POINT IN TIME?

00:56:56.780 --> 00:56:59.215
I ONLY HAVE FIVE DEPARTMENTS

00:56:59.282 --> 00:57:01.317
UTILIZING A LEGACY SYSTEM OKAY

00:57:01.384 --> 00:57:03.453
SO FOUR OF THEM.

00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:05.221
ARE USING THE CAL STAR SYSTEM.

00:57:05.288 --> 00:57:07.123
TWO OF WHICH ARE DOING IT FOR A

00:57:07.190 --> 00:57:08.525
FEDERAL REPORT.

00:57:08.591 --> 00:57:10.493
THAT AGAIN THE ISSUE -- IS RIGHT

00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:12.095
NOW OUTSIDE OF THE SYSTEMS

00:57:12.162 --> 00:57:14.430

00:57:21.137 --> 00:57:21.938
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

00:57:22.005 --> 00:57:23.706
SO AGAIN IT'S NOT PER SE A

00:57:23.773 --> 00:57:25.441
SYSTEM ISSUE IT'S IT'S THAT

00:57:25.508 --> 00:57:27.110
POLICY IN MAKING SURE THAT THAT

00:57:27.177 --> 00:57:27.610

SYSTEM -- AND WILL LIKELY CLOSE

00:57:38.221 --> 00:57:39.322
IN THE CAL STARS SYSTEM AND THAT

00:57:39.389 --> 00:57:40.757
WOULD BE THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD.

00:57:40.824 --> 00:57:42.258
AND AGAIN WITH THE NATURE OF

00:57:42.325 --> 00:57:45.028
WHAT THEY DO YOU -- IT WAS

00:57:45.094 --> 00:57:47.430
DEEMED AGAIN BY THE DEPARTMENT

00:57:47.497 --> 00:57:48.531
FINANCING THE PROJECT IT WAS IT

00:57:48.598 --> 00:57:50.333

00:57:50.400 --> 00:57:52.202
THAT THAT ADDITIONAL SAFETY NET

00:57:52.268 --> 00:57:54.737
FOR THEM -- AND THEN THAT SECOND

00:58:02.412 --> 00:58:03.613
BEHIND ME -- THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:58:03.680 --> 00:58:05.248
SOCIAL SERVICES IS IS THAT THE

00:58:05.315 --> 00:58:06.716
SECOND DEPARTMENT THAT WILL BE

00:58:06.783 --> 00:58:08.318
CLOSING UTILIZING A LEGACY

00:58:08.384 --> 00:58:09.018
SYSTEM.

00:58:09.085 --> 00:58:10.520
NOW THE OTHER DEPARTMENT THAT IS

00:58:10.587 --> 00:58:12.121
UTILIZING A LEGACY SYSTEM THAT

00:58:12.188 --> 00:58:15.391
WE THAT WE ARE AWARE OF IS --

00:58:15.458 --> 00:58:16.092
THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT

00:58:16.159 --> 00:58:19.596
DEPARTMENT EDT AND THEY DO NOT

00:58:19.662 --> 00:58:22.832
USE CAL STARS SO IT'S UNCLEAR TO

00:58:22.899 --> 00:58:25.201
US HOW MUCH -- OF THE WORK WE DO

00:58:25.268 --> 00:58:26.569
HAVE VISIBILITY INTO THEIR

00:58:26.636 --> 00:58:28.304
LEGACY SYSTEM SO I CAN'T REALLY

00:58:28.371 --> 00:58:29.606
DO A FAIR COMPARISON TO KNOW

00:58:29.672 --> 00:58:30.773
WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE WORK IS

00:58:30.840 --> 00:58:32.342
HAPPENING IN FISCAL VERSES.

00:58:32.408 --> 00:58:33.643
IN THEIR LEGACY BUT MY

00:58:33.710 --> 00:58:35.345
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THEY TOO

00:58:35.411 --> 00:58:36.512
WILL BE CLOSING THEIR BOOKS THIS

00:58:36.579 --> 00:58:38.948
YEAR IN THEIR LEGACY SYSTEM.

00:58:39.015 --> 00:58:40.884
SO WE SAID THAT WAS DEPLOYED TO

00:58:40.950 --> 00:58:42.952
ALL THE DEPARTMENTS WE HAD DONE

00:58:43.019 --> 00:58:44.354
THEIR CONVERSIONS.

00:58:44.420 --> 00:58:46.422
AND WE HAVE HAD THEM READY IN A

00:58:46.489 --> 00:58:48.224
POSITION WHERE WHAT WAS THE NEXT

00:58:48.291 --> 00:58:51.060
STEPS WITH A NEEDED -- TO

00:58:51.127 --> 00:58:53.229
VALIDATE THE INFORMATION THAT

00:58:53.296 --> 00:58:54.230
HAD BEEN CONVERTED.

00:58:54.297 --> 00:58:55.665
DO ANY ADDITIONAL CONFIGURATIONS

00:58:55.732 --> 00:58:56.866
THAT NEEDED TO BE DONE ON THE

00:58:56.933 --> 00:58:58.334
POST GO LOCAL GO LIVE SIDE

00:58:58.401 --> 00:58:59.535
BECAUSE EACH OTHER DEPARTMENTS

00:58:59.602 --> 00:59:00.904
CAN DO THEIR OWN CONFIGURATIONS

00:59:00.970 --> 00:59:02.472
FOR LABOR AND ALLOCATIONS AND

00:59:02.538 --> 00:59:03.373
SOME OF THOSE THINGS.

00:59:03.439 --> 00:59:07.510
AND IT ABSOLUTELY THERE WAS A

00:59:07.577 --> 00:59:08.511
NUMBER OF DEPARTMENTS AT THE

00:59:08.578 --> 00:59:09.746
BEGINNING OF THE THE CUTOVER

00:59:09.812 --> 00:59:12.215
THAT WERE UTILIZING BOTH FISCALE

00:59:12.282 --> 00:59:13.750
AND AND CAL STARS.

00:59:13.816 --> 00:59:14.817
BUT THAT WAS TRUE WITH ALL OF

00:59:14.884 --> 00:59:18.721
THE RELEASES IT IS THAT THAT.

00:59:18.788 --> 00:59:20.490
COMFORT WITH WHAT YOU NOW IN IN

00:59:20.556 --> 00:59:22.692

WERE TAKING THEM FROM THERE.

00:59:35.605 --> 00:59:38.308
YOU KNOW WHAT DID CAL STARS AND

00:59:38.374 --> 00:59:40.476
YOU KNOW I WANTED TO RUN REPORT.

00:59:40.543 --> 00:59:41.110
WELL FOR WHATEVER IT IS THAT IT

00:59:41.177 --> 00:59:42.545
MEANS SOMETHING IN PLAIN

00:59:42.612 --> 00:59:43.780
LANGUAGE.

00:59:43.846 --> 00:59:45.515

WELL AS LINKS FROM MY SIDE SO WE

00:59:57.327 --> 00:59:58.928
ARE CONTINUING TO IDENTIFY THOSE

00:59:58.995 --> 00:59:59.929
TYPES OF ISSUES AND ONE OF THE

00:59:59.996 --> 01:00:01.064
HURDLES.

01:00:01.130 --> 01:00:02.999
BETTER KEEPING DEPARTMENTS FROM

01:00:03.066 --> 01:00:04.334
BEING AS FLOWING TO THE SYSTEM.

01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:06.903
BUT VERY FEW DEPARTMENTS STILL

01:00:06.970 --> 01:00:08.271
HAVE ACCESS BESIDES VIEWING

01:00:08.338 --> 01:00:11.341
ACCESS TO THEIR CAL STARS DATA.

01:00:11.407 --> 01:00:12.775
OKAY SO IN IN THAT DEPARTMENT OF

01:00:12.842 --> 01:00:14.610
TECHNOLOGIES MARCH TWENTY

01:00:14.677 --> 01:00:16.879

FIVE FTV DSS -- DUAL AND EDT ON

01:00:31.861 --> 01:00:33.062
SOME OTHER LEGACY SYSTEM SO IT'S

01:00:33.129 --> 01:00:34.063
NOW SEVEN DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE

01:00:34.130 --> 01:00:37.900
ON GET THAT IS A FIVE IS CAL

01:00:37.967 --> 01:00:40.503

01:00:40.570 --> 01:00:42.038
LEGACY THINGS ARE A LOT OKAY

01:00:50.613 --> 01:00:53.049
THIS LEGACY SO. SIX SIX SIX IN

01:00:53.116 --> 01:00:55.418
TOTAL OKAY AND ARE THERE ANY OF

01:00:55.485 --> 01:00:56.085
THESE APARTMENTS STILL REPORTING

01:00:56.152 --> 01:00:57.587
CONCERNS WITH USING FISCALE TO

01:00:57.653 --> 01:00:59.522
MEET FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS.

01:00:59.589 --> 01:01:00.723
THERE IS A COUPLE THAT.

01:01:00.790 --> 01:01:01.657
THAT THE ISSUE THAT WAS

01:01:01.724 --> 01:01:03.092
OUTSTANDING AS TO WHY THEY WERE

01:01:03.159 --> 01:01:05.328
UTILIZING CAL STARS WAS FOR A

01:01:05.395 --> 01:01:06.629
SPECIFIC REPORT.

01:01:06.696 --> 01:01:08.831
THAT REPORT HAS BEEN AS FAR AS I

01:01:08.898 --> 01:01:10.666
KNOW HAS BEEN WORKED OUT WITH

01:01:10.733 --> 01:01:12.735
THE SCO AND THAT THE CONTROLLER

KNOW IF THEY'VE SUBMITTED IT YET

01:01:17.974 --> 01:01:18.741
SO AGAIN I WOULD BE MORE

01:01:18.808 --> 01:01:20.176
APPROPRIATE FOR THE NEXT PARENTS

01:01:20.243 --> 01:01:22.445
CIVIL ASSET NEXT TIME SO AND

01:01:22.512 --> 01:01:24.147
THEN AND THERE PERHAPS.

01:01:24.213 --> 01:01:25.448
THIS IS THE QUESTION THE NEXT

01:01:25.515 --> 01:01:27.016
HOUSE ALBEIT AT WHAT IS THE

01:01:27.083 --> 01:01:27.617
STATUS OF MONTH AND CLOSE PRO

01:01:27.683 --> 01:01:28.317
ENTITY SO HOW MANY OF THESE

01:01:28.384 --> 01:01:29.018
DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE.

01:01:29.085 --> 01:01:32.622
USING THE SYSTEM ARE ACTUALLY

01:01:40.096 --> 01:01:42.632
ARE 40% AMOUNTS WERE CLOSED.

01:01:42.698 --> 01:01:44.100
THAT NEEDED TO BE CLOSED AT THAT

01:01:44.167 --> 01:01:45.334
POINT IN TIME.

01:01:45.401 --> 01:01:48.971
TODAY SENT 42% OKAY DAY I'M UP

01:01:49.038 --> 01:01:51.841
273% OKAY SO WE ARE AGAIN THOSE

01:01:51.908 --> 01:01:53.409
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES THAT WE'VE

01:01:53.476 --> 01:01:54.811
BEEN ABLE.

01:01:54.877 --> 01:01:57.146
TO MOVE IN SHIFT FROM OTHER

01:01:57.213 --> 01:01:58.181

01:01:58.247 --> 01:01:59.515
AUGMENTATION THAT IS COMING IN

01:01:59.582 --> 01:02:03.086

01:02:19.102 --> 01:02:20.336
THAT'S BY WHEN THAT WILL BE BY

01:02:20.403 --> 01:02:22.572
THE THE THE DATES THAT WERE SET

01:02:22.638 --> 01:02:25.241
FORTH BY -- THAT BUT BY THE

01:02:25.308 --> 01:02:27.343

AND BUT THEN I KNOW THAT IN THE

01:02:40.790 --> 01:02:41.057
PAST WE HAVE.

01:02:41.124 --> 01:02:42.425
HAD REALLY UNTIL ABOUT OCTOBER

01:02:42.492 --> 01:02:44.727
FIRST OF SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH

01:02:44.794 --> 01:02:46.462
BEFORE THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE

01:02:46.529 --> 01:02:47.830
AND THAT THE COMPTROLLER'S

01:02:47.897 --> 01:02:48.431
OFFICE START WORKING WITH THE

01:02:48.498 --> 01:02:49.966
DEPARTMENT TO DO ESTIMATES SO.

01:02:50.032 --> 01:02:52.568
THAT BY THAT TIME FRAME IS WHAT

01:02:52.635 --> 01:02:54.637
WE'RE LOOKING AT SO TRY TO GET

01:02:54.704 --> 01:02:55.972
AS MANY AS WE CAN BY THE THE

01:02:56.038 --> 01:02:58.508
REQUIRED DEADLINES AND THEN ALSO.

01:02:58.574 --> 01:03:00.710
TARGETING THOSE BIG DEPARTMENTS

01:03:00.776 --> 01:03:02.278
ARE THOSE THOSE BIG DOLLAR VALUE

01:03:02.345 --> 01:03:04.547
DEPARTMENTS -- THE ONES ARE MOST

01:03:04.614 --> 01:03:06.182
MATERIAL TO THE STATE OF

01:03:06.249 --> 01:03:07.683
CALIFORNIA THOSE.

01:03:07.750 --> 01:03:09.118
ARE RECEIVING THE BULK OF OUR

01:03:09.185 --> 01:03:09.552
ATTENTION.

01:03:09.619 --> 01:03:10.786
SO WHAT THAT MEANS THAT THERE

01:03:10.853 --> 01:03:13.656
ARE SOME THAT WE'VE ANALYZED AND

01:03:13.723 --> 01:03:15.958
BASED ON EITHER HISTORY -- SIZE

01:03:16.025 --> 01:03:18.194
OR COMPLEXITY OR VACANCY RATES

01:03:18.261 --> 01:03:18.828
ARE THERE'S A NUMBER OF THINGS

01:03:18.895 --> 01:03:22.832
THAT WE LOOKED AT THERE WILL BE

01:03:22.899 --> 01:03:25.234
ABOUT -- THIRTY DEPARTMENTS THAT

01:03:25.301 --> 01:03:27.170
WE EXPECT WILL BE DOING.

01:03:27.236 --> 01:03:28.504
ESTIMATES THAT WE'RE WE'RE

01:03:28.571 --> 01:03:29.872
FAIRLY CONFIDENT WE'LL BE DOING

01:03:29.939 --> 01:03:30.640
ESTIMATES.

01:03:30.706 --> 01:03:33.109
AND THAT'S NOT A BAD THING WHEN

01:03:33.176 --> 01:03:34.477
YOU SEE THAT THEY REPRESENT.

01:03:34.544 --> 01:03:35.945
YOU KNOW WHAT.

01:03:36.012 --> 01:03:38.080
LESS THAN A FEW PERCENT OF THE

01:03:38.147 --> 01:03:39.615
TOTAL EXPENDITURES FOR THE STATE

01:03:39.682 --> 01:03:40.917
THEY'RE NOT FEDERALLY FUNDED

01:03:40.983 --> 01:03:43.853
DEPARTMENTS SO WILD THE GOAL IS

01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:45.888
YOU KNOW NEXT YEAR TO BE ABLE TO

01:03:45.955 --> 01:03:46.889
TO HAVE THEM ALL.

01:03:46.956 --> 01:03:49.392
YEAH WITH A VERY THICK THERE'S

01:03:49.458 --> 01:03:50.193
ALWAYS SOME THAT THEY DON'T.

01:03:50.259 --> 01:03:52.028
BUT WHAT WE WANT TO BE PUTTING

01:03:52.094 --> 01:03:52.662
THEM IN A POSITION WHERE THEY'RE

01:03:52.728 --> 01:03:54.263
ABLE.

01:03:54.330 --> 01:03:55.865
TO SOMETIMES DEPARTMENTS DON'T

01:03:55.932 --> 01:03:56.832
CLOSE FOR THINGS OUTSIDE OF

01:03:56.899 --> 01:03:58.401
FISCAL.

01:03:58.467 --> 01:04:00.169
AND AGAIN FISCAL HAS BROUGHT

01:04:00.236 --> 01:04:02.805
THESE THINGS TO LIGHT SO THERE

01:04:02.872 --> 01:04:05.741
ARE CERTAIN -- THINGS THAT ARE

01:04:05.808 --> 01:04:07.410
ACCEPTABLE -- ACCOUNTING

01:04:07.476 --> 01:04:09.345
PRACTICES THAT SOMETIMES YOU

THERE IS THIS LEARNING CURVE AND

01:04:22.358 --> 01:04:23.259
THE DEPARTMENTS ARE

01:04:23.326 --> 01:04:24.794
SIGNIFICANTLY.

01:04:24.860 --> 01:04:26.629
BETTER POSITIONS TO BE ABLE TO

01:04:26.696 --> 01:04:28.264
GET THEIR THEIR WORK DONE IN A

A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF WORK

01:12:03.652 --> 01:12:03.886
LEFT TO DO.

01:12:03.952 --> 01:12:04.920

SYSTEM ACTUALLY ON TO FACE CAL

01:13:21.897 --> 01:13:23.132
COMPLETELY.

01:13:23.198 --> 01:13:25.367
AND WHAT WAS THE ANTICIPATED --

01:13:25.434 --> 01:13:27.069
TIMELINE FOR THAT WERE WE WERE

01:13:27.136 --> 01:13:28.470
NO LONGER BE USING THE LEGACY

01:13:28.537 --> 01:13:30.405

DOUBLING UP. TO THE SENATE.

01:13:36.645 --> 01:13:37.980
THE DEPARTMENTS -- MIGHT HAVE

01:13:38.046 --> 01:13:38.981
OTHER LEGACY SYSTEMS THEY DO

01:13:39.047 --> 01:13:40.249
THINGS THAT ARE OUTSIDE THE

01:13:40.315 --> 01:13:40.816
SCOPE OF THE OF THE FISCAL

01:13:40.883 --> 01:13:41.850
SYSTEM.

01:13:41.917 --> 01:13:43.252
I CAME FROM A DEPARTMENT THAT

01:13:43.318 --> 01:13:46.355
THAT HAD ONE OF THOSE PRIOR TO I

01:13:46.421 --> 01:13:46.989
TOO WAS A A USER OF THE FISCAL

01:13:47.055 --> 01:13:47.489
SYSTEM.

01:13:47.556 --> 01:13:50.726
PRIOR TO COMING TO SCALE -- SO

01:13:50.793 --> 01:13:51.426
THERE ARE SOME OF THOSE THAT ARE

01:13:51.493 --> 01:13:53.495
OUTSIDE JUST THE INITIAL SCOPE

01:13:53.562 --> 01:13:54.830
AND AND WE WOULD HAVE TO TO

01:13:54.897 --> 01:13:56.698
THINK ABOUT ARE THOSE THINGS

01:13:56.765 --> 01:13:58.567
THAT WE WANT TO ADD ON BUT WITH

01:13:58.634 --> 01:14:00.402
RESPECT TO THE FOUR PARTNERS AND

01:14:00.469 --> 01:14:02.371
THEIR LEGACY SYSTEMS AND THEIR

01:14:02.437 --> 01:14:04.306
LEGACY MAINFRAMES -- THE

01:14:04.373 --> 01:14:05.841
DEPARTMENT FINANCES RETIRED FOUR

01:14:05.908 --> 01:14:06.842

TREASURER'S OFFICE IS READY TO

01:14:08.310 --> 01:14:09.945
RETIRE FOUR OF THEM BUT HASN'T

01:14:10.012 --> 01:14:11.180
YET BECAUSE THERE'S ONE PIECE

01:14:11.246 --> 01:14:13.482
THAT IS -- TIED TO THE

01:14:13.549 --> 01:14:15.551
CONTROLLERS FUNCTIONALITY THAT

WILL BE COMING BY THE END OF

01:14:16.218 --> 01:14:16.985
THIS YEAR.

01:14:17.052 --> 01:14:18.654
AND THEN ONCE THE CONTROLLER

01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:20.856
FUNCTIONALITY COMES ON WE HAVE

01:14:20.923 --> 01:14:23.058
THIS THE EXPECTATION IS THAT

01:14:23.125 --> 01:14:24.293
WE'RE GONNA RUN.

01:14:24.359 --> 01:14:26.662
IN IN PARALLEL -- FOR AT LEAST

01:14:26.728 --> 01:14:28.130
YOU KNOW FOR AT LEAST A YEAR TO

01:14:28.197 --> 01:14:29.598
MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ABLE TO

01:14:29.665 --> 01:14:31.099
PRODUCE THE KAFFIR WITH A HIGH

01:14:31.166 --> 01:14:33.068
CONFIDENCE RIGHT OUT OF OUR

01:14:33.135 --> 01:14:34.069
SYSTEM AND AND BE ABLE TO

01:14:34.136 --> 01:14:35.704
COMPARISON TO COMPARE THAT WITH.

01:14:35.771 --> 01:14:36.805
THE CAFFERTY INCREASED OUT OF

01:14:36.872 --> 01:14:38.707
THE LEGACY SYSTEM SO AGAIN THAT

01:14:38.774 --> 01:14:40.542
ULTIMATE WHEN DO YOU DEPARTMENTS

01:14:40.609 --> 01:14:43.245
OF THE CONTROL AGENCIES TURN OFF

01:14:43.312 --> 01:14:44.613
THEIR LEGACY SYSTEMS.

01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:46.515
THAT THAT'S MORE IN IN IN THEIR

01:14:46.582 --> 01:14:47.549
COURT IT'S ONCE THEY FEEL THAT

01:14:47.616 --> 01:14:48.817
WE HAVE BUILT ALL THE

01:14:48.884 --> 01:14:50.319
FUNCTIONALITY AND CAPACITY

01:14:50.385 --> 01:14:52.154
WITHIN HOURS -- AND LIKE I SAID

01:14:52.221 --> 01:14:54.623
WE'RE 98% OF THE REQUIREMENTS

01:14:54.690 --> 01:14:55.457
THAT WERE KNOWN REQUIREMENTS

01:14:55.524 --> 01:14:56.225
THAT.

01:14:56.291 --> 01:14:58.760
TODAY THAT I KNOW ABOUT -- THOSE

01:14:58.827 --> 01:15:01.096
ARE HAVE BEEN ALREADY DEPLOYED

01:15:01.163 --> 01:15:02.497
AND WITH RESPECT TO THE ANOTHER

01:15:02.564 --> 01:15:03.832
LEGACY SYSTEM THAT WE EXPECT TO

01:15:03.899 --> 01:15:05.267
BE RETIRED.

01:15:05.334 --> 01:15:07.302
IS THE CAL STARS SYSTEM AND

01:15:07.369 --> 01:15:08.737
WE'RE EXPECTING THAT ALSO TO BE

01:15:08.804 --> 01:15:11.206
WINDING DOWN -- IN TWENTY

01:15:11.273 --> 01:15:11.974
NINETEEN AS WELL AND AGAIN

01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:13.242
THERE'S ONLY A FEW DEPARTMENTS

01:15:13.308 --> 01:15:14.409
THAT ARE UTILIZING IT.

01:15:14.476 --> 01:15:16.945
REMAINING AND IT BECOMES AS YOU

01:15:17.012 --> 01:15:18.881
WERE YOU WERE ALLUDING TO IT

01:15:18.947 --> 01:15:22.217
BECOMES JUST AT THE WORKLOAD.

01:15:22.284 --> 01:15:23.552
FOR THE CONTROL AGENCIES OF THE

01:15:23.619 --> 01:15:24.920
DEPARTMENTS THEMSELVES TO IT TO

01:15:24.987 --> 01:15:27.189
BE HAVING A FOOT IN EACH DOOR.

01:15:27.256 --> 01:15:30.726
ARE IN EACH SYSTEM -- IT'S IT'S

01:15:30.792 --> 01:15:31.994
VERY BURDENSOME AND SO TO THE

01:15:32.060 --> 01:15:33.896
EXTENT THAT WE CAN GET THOSE

01:15:33.962 --> 01:15:35.731
APARTMENTS OFF OF CAL STARS WILL

01:15:35.797 --> 01:15:37.733
BE NOT ONLY RELIEF TO TO THE

01:15:37.799 --> 01:15:39.568
DEPARTMENTS BUT ALSO I WOULD.

01:15:39.635 --> 01:15:41.203
PRESUME A RELIEF TO THE FOLKS AT

01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:43.272
THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE THAT HAVE

01:15:43.338 --> 01:15:44.973
TO SUPPORT THAT SYSTEM.

01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:46.541
AND SO YOU MENTIONED THE RUN

01:15:46.608 --> 01:15:47.943
AROUND A PERIL SYSTEM IS THAT

01:15:48.010 --> 01:15:48.510
WITH THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S

01:15:48.577 --> 01:15:48.977
OFFICE YES.

01:15:49.044 --> 01:15:50.412
OKAY SO THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S

01:15:50.479 --> 01:15:52.414
OFFICE WILL BE THE LAST.

01:15:52.481 --> 01:15:53.916
OF THE INITIAL BATCH THE LAST

01:15:53.982 --> 01:15:55.484
WANTS TO MOVE AWAY FROM THE

01:15:55.550 --> 01:15:56.451
LEGACY SYSTEM.

01:15:56.518 --> 01:16:01.290
AND SO WE ANTICIPATE THAT STILL

01:16:01.356 --> 01:16:04.960
ANOTHER YEAR OUT [inaudible]

01:16:48.003 --> 01:16:50.138
YOUR FACING SOME RESISTANCE IN

01:16:50.205 --> 01:16:52.808
TERMS OF CHANGING WHICH I WOULD

01:16:52.874 --> 01:16:54.076
ANTICIPATE PEOPLE ARE PEOPLE ARE

01:16:54.142 --> 01:16:55.444
GENERALLY COMFORTABLE WITH A

01:16:55.510 --> 01:16:57.879
SYSTEM AND IT'S YOU KNOW LIKE IF

01:16:57.946 --> 01:16:59.314
YOU ASKED US ALL.

01:16:59.381 --> 01:17:01.049
TO GET OFF OF MICROSOFT WORD AND

01:17:01.116 --> 01:17:03.151
GO USE SOMETHING ELSE TOMORROW

01:17:03.218 --> 01:17:05.053
YEAH YOU WOULD YOU WOULD FACE

01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:06.455
RESISTANCE I JUST.

01:17:06.521 --> 01:17:08.590
IS REALITY EVEN OTHER COMPARABLE

01:17:08.657 --> 01:17:09.157
SYSTEMS EXACT SORT OF WHAT

01:17:09.224 --> 01:17:10.492
YOU'RE IN FOR ABSOLUTELY SIR AND

01:17:10.559 --> 01:17:12.427
AND AND YOU KNOW HUMANS HUMANS

01:17:12.494 --> 01:17:13.795
DON'T REACT THE CHAINS.

01:17:13.862 --> 01:17:14.896
THAT WELL SOME DO BETTER THAN

01:17:14.963 --> 01:17:16.865
OTHERS -- GOVERNMENT'S NOT VERY

01:17:16.932 --> 01:17:17.833
GOOD AT CHANGE MANAGEMENT

01:17:17.899 --> 01:17:18.800
BECAUSE WE DON'T TEND TO THINK

01:17:18.867 --> 01:17:19.768
OF THE HUMAN ASPECT OF OUR

01:17:19.835 --> 01:17:21.303
ACTIONS WE JUST WE'RE GOVERNMENT

01:17:21.370 --> 01:17:21.970
WE DO THINGS THE WAY WE DO

01:17:22.037 --> 01:17:23.705
THINGS AND EVERYBODY SORT HAS TO

01:17:23.772 --> 01:17:24.506
CONFORM TO THAT.

01:17:24.573 --> 01:17:27.876
AND THEN THAT'S COUPLED WITH AN

01:17:27.943 --> 01:17:29.277
ENVIRONMENT.

01:17:29.344 --> 01:17:31.980
LARGE IN OUR ACCOUNTING STAFF

01:17:32.047 --> 01:17:33.348
THAT THEY THEY'VE OPERATED IN

01:17:33.415 --> 01:17:35.450
AND IN A SYSTEM AND OUT WORLD

01:17:35.517 --> 01:17:36.585
FOR DECADES AND AND THEN WE

01:17:36.651 --> 01:17:37.552
WOULD DROP THIS MASSIVE NEW

01:17:37.619 --> 01:17:38.420
SYSTEM ON THEM THAT.

01:17:38.487 --> 01:17:39.087
HAS A LOT OF COMPLEXITY LOT MORE

01:17:39.154 --> 01:17:40.255
DETAIL WHICH BRINGS WITH IT

01:17:40.322 --> 01:17:42.090
TRANSPARENCY TRANSPARENCY COMES

01:17:42.157 --> 01:17:43.692
AT A COST -- SO SO THERE'S

01:17:43.759 --> 01:17:45.260
WORKLOAD THERE THERE'S NEW WAYS

01:17:45.327 --> 01:17:47.229
OF DOING BUSINESS -- AND THEN

01:17:47.295 --> 01:17:48.764
WE'RE FINDING OUT AS WE ROLLING

01:17:48.830 --> 01:17:50.532
THIS OUT THAT THERE'S CERTAIN

01:17:50.599 --> 01:17:51.833
THINGS THAT THESE DEPARTMENTS

01:17:51.900 --> 01:17:52.267
NEED THAT.

01:17:52.334 --> 01:17:53.702
WITH THE NEXT THING ALSO WERE

01:17:53.769 --> 01:17:54.503
BUILDING SOME OF THAT FOR THEM

01:17:54.569 --> 01:17:55.137
TO MAKE THEIR LIFE IS A SO IT'S

01:17:55.203 --> 01:17:56.104
SO IT'S ALL THAT'S WHAT'S THE

01:17:56.171 --> 01:17:56.738
EARLY OUT REACH ITS ENGAGEMENTS

01:17:56.805 --> 01:17:57.973
GETTING THEIR INPUT INTO THE

01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:00.342
SYSTEM DESIGN AND HOW IT WORKS.

01:18:00.409 --> 01:18:01.510
IT'S BRING AMENDED TRYING THEM

01:18:01.576 --> 01:18:02.844
ON SITE TEST GIVE US FEEDBACK

01:18:02.911 --> 01:18:04.746
ITERATE AND AND SUPPORT AMONG

01:18:04.813 --> 01:18:05.747
ROLLED OUT LIVE IT'S ALL OF

01:18:05.814 --> 01:18:07.049
THOSE THINGS -- SUITS WHICH

01:18:07.115 --> 01:18:08.150
DEPARTMENT WOULD YOU SAY ARE THE

01:18:08.216 --> 01:18:13.688
FURTHEST ALONG THAT CURVE CHANGE

01:18:13.755 --> 01:18:15.624
MANAGEMENT -- WE HAVE A NUMBER

01:18:15.690 --> 01:18:16.725
THAT -- ARE CLOSING ON A ON A

01:18:16.792 --> 01:18:18.794
REGULAR AND CONSISTANT BASIS SO --

01:18:18.860 --> 01:18:19.895
YEAH THE PARTNERS ARE VERY FAR

01:18:19.961 --> 01:18:21.897
ALONG ON THAT BUT I'D SAY THAT

01:18:21.963 --> 01:18:23.331
THAT CALIFORNIA'S FAR AND THEY

01:18:23.398 --> 01:18:25.367
WERE TWENTY EIGHTEEN RELEASE

01:18:25.434 --> 01:18:27.202
DEPARTMENT -- AND THEN I HAVE

01:18:27.269 --> 01:18:29.204
SOME THAT WERE IN MY WAVE ONE

01:18:29.271 --> 01:18:30.372
THAT ARE LAGGING BEHIND THE

01:18:30.439 --> 01:18:31.940
CURVE ON IT.

01:18:32.007 --> 01:18:34.176
AND IN THEIR INSTANCES THEY'VE

01:18:34.242 --> 01:18:36.845
HAD SIGNIFICANT -- TURN OF

01:18:36.912 --> 01:18:37.712
RATIONS IT'S NOT.

01:18:37.779 --> 01:18:38.547
IT'S BECAUSE OUR SMALL

01:18:38.613 --> 01:18:39.815
DEPARTMENT YOU LOSE ONE PERSON%

01:18:39.881 --> 01:18:42.217
YOU'VE LOST YOU KNOW 20% OF YOUR

01:18:42.284 --> 01:18:43.952
ACCOUNTING STAFF OR OR MORE IN

01:18:44.019 --> 01:18:45.187
SOME CASES.

01:18:45.253 --> 01:18:47.856
AND SO THAT LEARNING CURVE IS

01:18:47.923 --> 01:18:49.558
YOU KNOW A DIFFERENT CHALLENGE

01:18:49.624 --> 01:18:50.025
FOR FOR SOME OF THOSE

01:18:50.092 --> 01:18:51.760
DEPARTMENTS BUT WE DO HAVE QUITE

01:18:51.827 --> 01:18:53.261
A FEW I MEAN F. T. B. EVEN

01:18:53.328 --> 01:18:53.895
THOUGH THEY'RE GONNA BE CLOSING

01:18:53.962 --> 01:18:54.729
IN LEGACY.

01:18:54.796 --> 01:18:57.132
THEY HAVE BEEN EXCELLING IN THIS

01:18:57.199 --> 01:18:58.233
THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH

01:18:58.300 --> 01:19:00.435
HAS BEEN -- K. PUSHING.

01:19:00.502 --> 01:19:01.903
PUSHING AHEAD AND SOME OF THOSE

01:19:01.970 --> 01:19:03.205
WERE I MENTION BECAUSE THEY THEY

01:19:03.271 --> 01:19:04.506
WERE SURPRISING TO ME THEY WERE

01:19:04.573 --> 01:19:06.641
THE ONES THAT I HAD ON MY RADAR

01:19:06.708 --> 01:19:10.479
AS ALL MY GOSH I I THESE ARE

01:19:10.545 --> 01:19:11.046
THINGS THAT THAT ABSOLUTELY

01:19:11.113 --> 01:19:12.514
CANNOT FAIL WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE

01:19:12.581 --> 01:19:14.249
THAT THESE DEPARTMENTS.

01:19:14.316 --> 01:19:16.384
ARE SUCCESSFUL CHP IS ANOTHER

01:19:16.451 --> 01:19:17.285
ONE IT WAS A TWENTY EIGHTEEN

01:19:17.352 --> 01:19:18.420
DEPARTMENT THAT -- WE'RE NOT

01:19:18.487 --> 01:19:19.788
EVEN PROVIDING ADDITIONAL

01:19:19.855 --> 01:19:20.856
RESOURCES TO HELP THEM BECAUSE

01:19:20.922 --> 01:19:22.390
THEY ARE SOMEONE TOP OF THAT

01:19:22.457 --> 01:19:24.960
THEY HAVEN'T HAD -- ANY ISSUE SO

01:19:25.026 --> 01:19:26.161
SO THERE'S DEFINITELY

01:19:26.228 --> 01:19:27.496
DEPARTMENTS THAT IN AGAIN.

01:19:27.562 --> 01:19:29.131
DESPITE WHAT I THINK SOME OF THE

01:19:29.197 --> 01:19:30.265
ORIGINAL THINKING WAS WE'RE

01:19:30.332 --> 01:19:30.765
GONNA BRING ON THE SMALL

01:19:30.832 --> 01:19:33.535
DEPARTMENTS AND AND WE LEARNED

01:19:33.602 --> 01:19:35.203
FROM CONTROL AGENCY ANNA AND THE

01:19:35.270 --> 01:19:36.004
PROJECT.

01:19:36.071 --> 01:19:37.372
BUT HAD WE BROUGHT IN THE LARGER

01:19:37.439 --> 01:19:39.674
DEPARTMENTS FIRST I THINK THAT

01:19:39.741 --> 01:19:41.810
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN EASIER HOLE

01:19:41.877 --> 01:19:42.477
FOR THE SMALLER ONES BECAUSE WE

01:19:42.544 --> 01:19:43.311
WOULD HAVE.

01:19:43.378 --> 01:19:43.778
BECAUSE THERE'S MORE

01:19:43.845 --> 01:19:45.547
SOPHISTICATION IN THESE LARGER

01:19:45.614 --> 01:19:46.815
DEPARTMENTS AND THERE'S MORE TO

01:19:46.882 --> 01:19:47.949
ACCOUNTING THAT NEEDED TO HAPPEN

01:19:48.016 --> 01:19:50.118
MORE COMPLEXITY SO THE ISSUES

01:19:50.185 --> 01:19:52.287
THAT THAT WE'RE IDENTIFYING WE

01:19:52.354 --> 01:19:53.555
WOULD HAVE IDENTIFIED.

01:19:53.622 --> 01:19:54.422
EARLIER IN THE CURRENT AND IN

01:19:54.489 --> 01:19:57.025
REGARDS TO CAL FIRE WHAT WHAT

01:19:57.092 --> 01:19:59.027
WOULD YOU THINK MADE THEN.

01:19:59.094 --> 01:20:00.562
ADOPT OR WHAT WHAT WHAT MADE

01:20:00.629 --> 01:20:01.229
THEM SUCCESSFUL.

01:20:01.296 --> 01:20:04.266
BOTH CAL FIRE IN C. H. P. HAD A

01:20:04.332 --> 01:20:05.567
DESIGNATED.

01:20:05.634 --> 01:20:08.069
SENIOR PERSON WHO OWNS THIS GUY

01:20:08.136 --> 01:20:10.405
IT WAS THEIR JOB TO BRING THEIR

01:20:10.472 --> 01:20:13.508
DEPARTMENT -- ON TO FISCAL.

01:20:13.575 --> 01:20:14.009
AND THEY WERE GIVEN THE

01:20:14.075 --> 01:20:15.210
AUTHORITY.

01:20:15.277 --> 01:20:17.345
AND THE RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO

01:20:17.412 --> 01:20:20.382
DO THAT SO WITH THE WITH CAL

01:20:20.448 --> 01:20:23.285
FIRE THEY HAVE -- INVESTED

01:20:23.351 --> 01:20:24.853
BECAUSE THEY'RE ONE OF THOSE

01:20:24.920 --> 01:20:25.954
DISPERSED DEPARTMENTS SAID

01:20:26.021 --> 01:20:27.355
THEY'VE GOT OFFICES IN AN

01:20:27.422 --> 01:20:28.857
ACCOUNTING HAPPENING ALL UP AND

01:20:28.924 --> 01:20:29.457
DOWN THE STATE YOU THINK THAT

01:20:29.524 --> 01:20:31.760
WOULD BE HARDER THEY HAVE HAD

01:20:31.826 --> 01:20:33.228
THIS INDIVIDUAL HAS TRAVELED UP

01:20:33.295 --> 01:20:34.329
AND DOWN THE STATE THEY HAVE

01:20:34.396 --> 01:20:35.997
BEEN DOING CHANGE MANAGEMENT.

01:20:36.064 --> 01:20:38.400
FOR ALMOST TWO YEARS -- AND SO

01:20:38.466 --> 01:20:40.001
IT WASN'T JUST WHEN WE STARTED

01:20:40.068 --> 01:20:56.184
ENGAGING

01:22:54.436 --> 01:22:54.736
IT'S THAT HAVE LIKE

01:22:54.803 --> 01:22:56.538
THAT SINGLE POINT OF CONTACT.

01:22:56.604 --> 01:22:58.907
AND THEY AREN'T.

01:22:58.973 --> 01:23:01.242
THE THE SPONSOR THE VANDALS BUT

01:23:01.309 --> 01:23:02.677
BUT THEY ARE THE ONES THAT ARE

01:23:02.744 --> 01:23:04.813
THE DECISION MAKERS THOSE

01:23:04.879 --> 01:23:06.081
DEPARTMENTS STRUGGLE MICHAEL.

01:23:06.147 --> 01:23:07.515
BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS A SINGLE

01:23:07.582 --> 01:23:09.250
BOTTLENECK IN THAT CASE SO WE'VE

01:23:09.317 --> 01:23:10.852
TAKEN THE SPONSOR TO AN EXTRA IN

01:23:10.919 --> 01:23:11.953
WHERE THEY ARE THE ONLY ONES

01:23:12.020 --> 01:23:14.356
THAT CAN MAKE DECISIONS AND

01:23:14.422 --> 01:23:14.956
THOSE DEPARTMENTS CONTINUE TO

01:23:15.023 --> 01:23:17.625
STRUGGLE.

01:23:17.692 --> 01:23:19.294
IT ENDED IN TERMS OF AND SO AS

01:23:19.361 --> 01:23:21.196
YOU DEAL WITH THESE DEPARTMENTS

01:23:21.262 --> 01:23:23.398

YOUR THAT THAT PROJECT LEADER.

01:23:29.070 --> 01:23:30.438
IN EACH DEPARTMENT IS SWITCHING

01:23:30.505 --> 01:23:31.940
UP THOSE PEOPLE OR WHAT WHAT HOW

ARE YOU APPROACHING AT THAT

01:23:33.208 --> 01:23:34.442
AGAIN THAT'S THAT DEPENDENT

01:23:34.509 --> 01:23:35.744
APARTMENTS GET TO MAKE THEIR

01:23:35.810 --> 01:23:37.312
ASSIGNMENTS AS TO WHO WORKS ON

THESE TYPES OF EFFORTS.

01:23:38.713 --> 01:23:40.115
BUT AS PART OF OUR CHANGE

01:23:40.181 --> 01:23:41.883

01:24:48.616 --> 01:24:51.119
HAS A NEWER SYSTEM.

01:24:51.186 --> 01:24:53.388
SO IT'S NOT TOTALLY INTEGRATED

01:24:53.455 --> 01:24:54.956
IT'S JUST TO INTERFACE A HOUSE

01:24:55.023 --> 01:24:56.925
HOW DOES THAT WORK WITH.

01:24:56.991 --> 01:24:58.793
SISTEMA DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE --

01:24:58.860 --> 01:25:00.361
DEPLOYED BUT THEY THEY AND THEY

01:25:00.428 --> 01:25:01.196
HAVE THEIR OWN SYSTEM WHERE

01:25:01.262 --> 01:25:02.797
YOU'RE JUST THE SYSTEM TO JUST

01:25:02.864 --> 01:25:04.299
SORT OF TALKING TO EACH OTHER.

01:25:04.365 --> 01:25:05.099
WITH THE RIGHT NOW OUR

01:25:05.166 --> 01:25:07.068
INTERFACING INTO THE STATE

01:25:07.135 --> 01:25:08.670
COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE ON THE

01:25:08.736 --> 01:25:09.871
ACCOUNTING.

01:25:09.938 --> 01:25:11.873
AND IT'S AT THE HIGH LEVEL THAT

01:25:11.940 --> 01:25:13.441
THOSE INTERFACES EXIST WHEN A

01:25:13.508 --> 01:25:14.742
CONTROLLER COMES ON THOSE

01:25:14.809 --> 01:25:16.411
INTERFACES WILL BE POINTED YEAH

01:25:16.478 --> 01:25:17.979
MOVED FROM THEIR LEGACY INTO MY

01:25:18.046 --> 01:25:18.713
SYSTEM.

01:25:18.780 --> 01:25:22.083
BUT IT'LL STILL BE THAT HIGH

01:25:22.150 --> 01:25:23.585
LEVEL OF CAPTURE.

01:25:23.651 --> 01:25:24.519
IT'S NOT UNTIL WE USE A HIGH

01:25:24.586 --> 01:25:25.420
LEVEL MEETING TO SINCE YOU DON'T

01:25:25.487 --> 01:25:26.621
YOU DON'T SEE F. T. E. ZERO C.

01:25:26.688 --> 01:25:27.922
POSITIONS JUST.

01:25:27.989 --> 01:25:30.291
JUST BROAD BRUSH EXPENDITURES

01:25:30.358 --> 01:25:31.226
I'M IN THE PAST THAT I DON'T

01:25:31.292 --> 01:25:33.628
KNOW WHAT LEVEL OF DETAIL YOU

01:25:33.695 --> 01:25:35.063
GUYS CAPTURE I DON'T.

01:25:35.129 --> 01:25:35.930
I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO BE

01:25:35.997 --> 01:25:37.599
AT THAT LEVEL OF DETAIL UNTIL

01:25:37.665 --> 01:25:39.200
THEY'RE ACTUALLY ON FISCAL.

01:25:39.267 --> 01:25:39.801
GOING TO BE MORE OF A SUMMARY

01:25:39.868 --> 01:25:41.135
LEVEL.

01:25:41.202 --> 01:25:43.037
SOME OF THE LIKE WE SPENT THIS

01:25:43.104 --> 01:25:45.406
MUCH MONEY AND WE GOT THIS MONEY

01:25:45.473 --> 01:25:46.641
LIKE WHEN YOU SEE SOME ELECT

01:25:46.708 --> 01:25:47.609
FIVE LINE ITEM TO DOCUMENT ON

01:25:47.675 --> 01:25:48.877
I'LL BE MORE NAP BUT IT'S NOT

01:25:48.943 --> 01:25:49.711
GOING TO BE THE KIND OF DETAIL

01:25:49.777 --> 01:25:51.646
WHERE YOU CAN BE ABLE TO SEE HOW

01:25:51.713 --> 01:25:52.046
MUCH THEY SPENT.

01:25:52.113 --> 01:25:55.316
ON ON FRUITS AND VEGETABLES FOR

01:25:55.383 --> 01:25:57.252
EXAMPLE HERE SAYS.

01:25:57.318 --> 01:25:59.888
A MUCH BROADER ARM OF LEVEL LIKE

01:25:59.954 --> 01:26:01.556
MAYBE FOOD RIGHT.

01:26:01.623 --> 01:26:03.324
WHAT WHAT WHAT WE'RE DOING PC

01:26:03.391 --> 01:26:04.192
HIS ON AFTER ANNOUNCEMENT BUT

01:26:04.259 --> 01:26:04.859
JUST HAVE SO IT'S LIKE SO CAN WE

01:26:04.926 --> 01:26:05.927
SEE ALL THE DIFFERENT?

01:26:05.994 --> 01:26:08.396
BC PEAS AND WORK WHERE THEY'RE

01:26:08.463 --> 01:26:09.964
GOING.

01:26:10.031 --> 01:26:12.867
ON THE BUDGET SIDE -- I JUST SIX

01:26:12.934 --> 01:26:13.368
I DIDN'T.

01:26:13.434 --> 01:26:14.836
LIKE THAT LIKE SO FOR US WE GET

01:26:14.903 --> 01:26:15.970
A LOT OF BUDGETARY PROPOSALS.

01:26:16.037 --> 01:26:17.906
THAT THOSE ARE ALL SORT OF TIED

01:26:17.972 --> 01:26:19.207
TO PRIMARILY HEAD COUNT.

01:26:19.274 --> 01:26:22.043
AND SO DO WE DO WE SEE.

01:26:22.110 --> 01:26:24.479
WOULD WE SEE BE ABLE TO SEE THAT

01:26:24.546 --> 01:26:26.481
IN FRISCO IN THE BUDGET.

01:26:26.548 --> 01:26:27.916
AND THE BUDGET SIDE ABSOLUTELY

01:26:27.982 --> 01:26:29.617
ON THE BUDGET SIDE BUT NOT AS ON

01:26:29.684 --> 01:26:30.552
THE DEPARTMENT HE SOMEONE ON A

01:26:30.618 --> 01:26:32.320
COUNTY.

01:26:32.387 --> 01:26:32.954
RIGHT WOULDN'T COME TO US ON THE

01:26:33.021 --> 01:26:34.088
ACCOUNT GOT.

01:26:34.155 --> 01:26:35.056
SO FISCAL HAS BOTH -- FISCAL HAS

01:26:35.123 --> 01:26:37.559
BOTH THE HYPERION PLATFORM IN

01:26:37.625 --> 01:26:39.127
SYSTEM THAT WE DO THE BUDGET ON

01:26:39.193 --> 01:26:42.830
AND THAT THE PEOPLE SOFT AS TO

01:26:42.897 --> 01:26:44.566
WHAT WE DO THE ACCOUNTING SIDE.

01:26:44.632 --> 01:26:47.335
GOT IT -- AND SO THEN FOR THE

01:26:47.402 --> 01:26:47.936
ACCOUNTING SOFTWARE THAN WITH

01:26:48.002 --> 01:26:49.938
THEIR IT IS A GOAL TO HAVE A

01:26:50.004 --> 01:26:50.672
MORE.

01:26:50.738 --> 01:26:54.342
SAY DETAILED BREAKDOWN OF CDC

01:26:54.409 --> 01:26:56.544
ARE OR CALTRANS VEGAS WHERE

01:26:56.611 --> 01:26:57.946
WHERE IS THIS GOING.

01:26:58.012 --> 01:26:59.213
YES I MEAN THE THE LEVEL OF

01:26:59.280 --> 01:27:00.515
DETAIL WE HAVE CURRENTLY IN THE

01:27:00.582 --> 01:27:02.283
SYSTEM IN THIS IS AGAIN A GOOD

01:27:02.350 --> 01:27:02.850
CONVERSATION I THINK FOR THE

01:27:02.917 --> 01:27:05.486
SECOND PANEL -- BUT THE THE

01:27:05.553 --> 01:27:06.688
LEVEL OF DETAIL THAT THE

01:27:06.754 --> 01:27:07.789
APARTMENTS CAN RECORD

01:27:07.855 --> 01:27:10.325
INFORMATION IN IN OUR SYSTEM CAN

01:27:10.391 --> 01:27:12.427
BE IT IS QUITE.

01:27:12.493 --> 01:27:13.795
A FINE LEVEL NOW IS THAT.

01:27:13.861 --> 01:27:16.164
THE LEVEL WE WANT. TO REQUIRE

01:27:16.230 --> 01:27:18.032
DEPARTMENTS TO TO PROVIDE

01:27:18.099 --> 01:27:19.701
INFORMATION GIVEN THE THE FLIP

01:27:19.767 --> 01:27:21.369
SIDE WHICH IS THE WORKLOAD AND

01:27:21.436 --> 01:27:22.337
WHAT IS THE VALUE OF KNOWING

01:27:22.403 --> 01:27:24.973
THAT IT'S A GALA APPLE VERSES OF

01:27:25.039 --> 01:27:26.941
FUJI APPLE.

01:27:27.008 --> 01:27:28.576
OR GRANNY SMITH APPLE YOU KNOW.

01:27:28.643 --> 01:27:30.545
SO SO THERE HAS TO BE KIND OF

01:27:30.612 --> 01:27:33.181
THAT BALANCE OF AT WHAT LEVEL OF

01:27:33.247 --> 01:27:34.415
DETAIL DO YOU WANT THAT BUT THE

01:27:34.482 --> 01:27:37.018
SYSTEM HAS THE ABILITY TO

01:27:37.085 --> 01:27:38.686
CAPTURE AT A VERY FINE.

01:27:38.753 --> 01:27:40.388
OKAY IF I CAN JUST ADD ON THAT

01:27:40.455 --> 01:27:43.091
SIR -- IT WAS THAT I WAS

01:27:43.157 --> 01:27:44.125
INVOLVED IN THE EARLY PLANNING

01:27:44.192 --> 01:27:45.760
OF THIS PROJECT TWELVE FOURTEEN

01:27:45.827 --> 01:27:48.396
YEARS AGO AND AND THAT THAT TIME.

01:27:48.463 --> 01:27:49.697
THE ADMINISTRATION BACK THEN AND

01:27:49.764 --> 01:27:50.832
WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE WE HAD

01:27:50.898 --> 01:27:52.300
A FEW BIG DEPARTMENTS THAT THAT

01:27:52.367 --> 01:27:53.368
NEEDED TO MOVE FORWARD WITH

01:27:53.434 --> 01:27:54.802
ACCOUNTING SYSTEMS WITH THE RP

01:27:54.869 --> 01:27:56.337
SYSTEMS AND BUT WE ALSO KNOW

01:27:56.404 --> 01:27:57.338
WE'RE TRYING TO PUT SOMETHING

01:27:57.405 --> 01:27:58.506
FROM STATEWIDE PERSPECTIVE BUT

01:27:58.573 --> 01:28:00.742
IT THE DECISION THAT MADE AT THE

01:28:00.808 --> 01:28:01.009
TIME THAT.

01:28:01.075 --> 01:28:02.076
YOU KNOW CALTRANS IS SO BIG

01:28:02.143 --> 01:28:02.810
CITIES ARE SO BIG THEY HAVE

01:28:02.877 --> 01:28:03.811
THEIR OWN ECONOMIES OF SCALE

01:28:03.878 --> 01:28:05.013
THAT IT WAS WORTH IT TO INVEST

01:28:05.079 --> 01:28:06.514
IN THOSE SYSTEMS AT THAT TIME.

01:28:06.581 --> 01:28:07.348
KNOWING THAT AT SOME POINT DOWN

01:28:07.415 --> 01:28:08.282
THE ROAD WE WOULD BE THE

01:28:08.349 --> 01:28:10.218
STATEWIDE SYSTEM AND EVENTUALLY

01:28:10.284 --> 01:28:11.386
WE WE WOULD BRING THEM INTO THE

01:28:11.452 --> 01:28:12.387
FOLD THIS WAS PLANNED ALLALONG

01:28:12.453 --> 01:28:13.388
THIS WAS IT WAS IT WAS

01:28:13.454 --> 01:28:14.589
UNDERSTOOD IN THE EARLY PLANNING

01:28:14.656 --> 01:28:15.790
STAGES.

01:28:15.857 --> 01:28:17.291
AND AND IT'S STILL OUR PLANET

01:28:17.358 --> 01:28:18.593
WHEN WHEN IT'S TIME TO REPLACE

01:28:18.660 --> 01:28:19.794
THOSE THE OUR PEACE THEY'RE NOT

01:28:19.861 --> 01:28:21.162
GOING TO REPLACE MY PLAN IS TO

01:28:21.229 --> 01:28:22.163
ROLL THEM INTO FISCAL UNABLE TO

01:28:22.230 --> 01:28:23.765
HAVE FULL FUNCTIONALITY THAT

01:28:23.831 --> 01:28:24.932
POINT FACTOR UNDERLYING QUESTION.

01:28:24.999 --> 01:28:26.901
WELL THE LARGEST COST FOR US IS

01:28:26.968 --> 01:28:30.438
A STATE IS ON PERSONNEL AND IN A

01:28:30.505 --> 01:28:31.706
STAFFING ACOSTA WELL.

01:28:31.773 --> 01:28:37.378
WILL WE SEE THAT FROM A

01:28:37.445 --> 01:28:39.147
DEPARTMENT LEVEL.

01:28:39.213 --> 01:28:40.615
IT DOES THIS THE PERSONAL COSTS

01:28:40.682 --> 01:28:41.449
ARE IN THE BUDGET THEY'RE IN THE

01:28:41.516 --> 01:28:42.517
BUDGET ACT IN AND I WOULD JUST

01:28:42.583 --> 01:28:43.918
ADD ANOTHER THING TO DISCUSS

01:28:43.985 --> 01:28:45.319
BROUGHT TO US AND I THINK MISSES

01:28:45.386 --> 01:28:46.821
ME DON'T COVER IN OUR OPENING

01:28:46.888 --> 01:28:49.290
BUT THIS THE PAST THREE BUDGETS

AND THIS NEXT BUDGET WHEN IT'S

01:28:49.991 --> 01:28:51.192
DONE -- WILL BE AT A LEVEL OF

01:28:51.259 --> 01:28:52.060
DETAIL THAT BE DONE IN THE

01:28:52.126 --> 01:28:53.561
SYSTEM AND A LITTLE DETAIL TO

01:28:53.628 --> 01:28:55.029
THE LEGISLATURE IN THE PUBLIC

01:28:55.096 --> 01:28:55.697
THAT IS THE SAME UPDATE THAT WE

01:28:55.763 --> 01:28:57.465
PURCHASE PREVIOUSLY COULD ONLY

01:28:57.532 --> 01:28:59.000
PROVIDE THE JAN TEN BUDGET.

01:28:59.067 --> 01:29:02.937

THAT SHE IS NOT COMMITTED TO THE

01:29:54.422 --> 01:29:56.557

THE CONTROLLERS LETTER AND HER

01:30:02.864 --> 01:30:04.232
CONCERNS WERE BASICALLY AROUND

01:30:04.298 --> 01:30:05.600
SOME OF THE TIMELINESS ISSUES

01:30:05.666 --> 01:30:06.834
REGARDING THE BOOK A RECORD

01:30:06.901 --> 01:30:08.970
BECAUSE OF THE INTERFACES THAT

01:30:09.036 --> 01:30:10.805
WERE MENTIONED EARLIER -- AS WE

01:30:10.872 --> 01:30:12.874
MENTIONED THE INTERFACES CAUSED

01:30:12.940 --> 01:30:14.976
SOME ADDITIONAL WORKLOAD. TO THE

01:30:15.042 --> 01:30:16.511
COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE STAFF WERE

01:30:16.577 --> 01:30:17.912
SOME OF THE CASH REMITTANCES

01:30:17.979 --> 01:30:19.781
COULDN'T BE CAPTURED AS TIMELY

01:30:19.847 --> 01:30:21.549
AS WE WOULD HAVE NEEDED.

01:30:21.616 --> 01:30:23.151
TO ON THE LEGACY SIDE ON THE FOR

01:30:23.217 --> 01:30:24.418
THE BOOK A RECORD.

01:30:24.485 --> 01:30:25.720
AND THEREFORE WE PRODUCE THAT

01:30:25.787 --> 01:30:27.155
CASH REPORT THAT MONTH THE

01:30:27.221 --> 01:30:30.291
NUMBERS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER

01:30:30.358 --> 01:30:32.360
AND THAN WHAT SOME OF THE OTHER

01:30:32.426 --> 01:30:33.594
REPORTS WERE SHOWING SUCH THAT'S

01:30:33.661 --> 01:30:34.829
WHAT HER CONCERN WAS ABOUT THAT

01:30:34.896 --> 01:30:36.564
WE NEED A TIME TO MAKE SURE.

01:30:36.631 --> 01:30:39.433
THAT THIS OUR WORKLOAD WAS ABLE

01:30:39.500 --> 01:30:40.802
TO BE PROCESSED WE NEED SOME

01:30:40.868 --> 01:30:42.937
ASSISTANCE FROM A PROJECT TO

01:30:43.004 --> 01:30:43.971
CREATE THESE ENHANCEMENTS THAT

01:30:44.038 --> 01:30:45.473
WE NEEDED TO BE ABLE.

01:30:45.540 --> 01:30:46.974
TO GET THIS WORK DONE.

01:30:47.041 --> 01:30:49.477
AND WE NEED IT TO BE ABLE TO

01:30:49.544 --> 01:30:51.045
SLOW DOWN AND WE USE THE TERM

01:30:51.112 --> 01:30:52.513
STABILIZATION EVEN ON THAT MAY

01:30:52.580 --> 01:30:53.147
NOT HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY

01:30:53.214 --> 01:30:55.049
ACCURATE STABILIZE THE SYSTEM IF

01:30:55.116 --> 01:30:55.650
YOU WILL.

01:30:55.716 --> 01:30:57.652
SO THAT THE CASH MANAGEMENT

01:30:57.718 --> 01:30:58.319
STAFF CAN ACTUALLY DO THEIR WORK

01:30:58.386 --> 01:30:59.287
AND HAVE.

01:30:59.353 --> 01:31:00.354
NUMBERS IN THE BOOK OF RECORD

01:31:00.421 --> 01:31:01.823
THAT THEY CAN TRUST THAT'S WHAT

01:31:01.889 --> 01:31:03.157
IT WAS ALL ABOUT.

01:31:03.224 --> 01:31:04.325
AND WE WORK TOGETHER WITH THE

01:31:04.392 --> 01:31:05.827
PROJECT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

01:31:05.893 --> 01:31:07.195
AND WE DID COME UP WITH SOME

01:31:07.261 --> 01:31:09.463
SOLUTIONS TO TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN.

01:31:09.530 --> 01:31:11.032
AND IT IS WORKING BETTER AT THE

01:31:11.098 --> 01:31:12.967
TIME THAT CASH MANAGEMENT STAFF

01:31:13.034 --> 01:31:14.101
WERE SPENDING IN PROCESSING

01:31:14.168 --> 01:31:15.369
REMITTANCES.

01:31:15.436 --> 01:31:17.939
HAS GONE DOWN FROM A MAXIMUM OF

01:31:18.005 --> 01:31:19.607
FIFTEEN DAYS AND WE'RE DOWN TO

01:31:19.674 --> 01:31:21.175
THREE DAYS RIGHT NOW BECAUSE OF

01:31:21.242 --> 01:31:22.710
ALL THE STABILIZATION EFFORT SO

01:31:22.777 --> 01:31:24.178
WE WANT TO GET DOWN TO ONE DAY

01:31:24.245 --> 01:31:24.745
WHICH IS WHAT OUR GOAL HAS

01:31:24.812 --> 01:31:26.013
ALWAYS BEEN.

01:31:26.080 --> 01:31:28.182
HOWEVER IT IS GETTING BETTER --

01:31:28.249 --> 01:31:29.283
SO THAT'S WHAT THE LETTER WAS

01:31:29.350 --> 01:31:30.318
ABOUT IT WASN'T TO IMPLY THAT

01:31:30.384 --> 01:31:31.953
THE PROJECT IS A FAILURE OR TO

01:31:32.019 --> 01:31:33.921
IMPLY THAT WE'RE NOT COMMITTED

01:31:33.988 --> 01:31:34.589
TO IT AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO SEE

01:31:34.655 --> 01:31:35.423
IT THROUGH.

01:31:35.489 --> 01:31:36.724
THESE INTERFACES THE PARALLEL

01:31:36.791 --> 01:31:37.892
SYSTEM THAT WE'VE DISCUSSED

01:31:37.959 --> 01:31:39.126
REALLY WHAT IT IS IS AN

01:31:39.193 --> 01:31:40.995
INTERFACE SYSTEM WHERE WE HAVE.

01:31:41.062 --> 01:31:43.097
SCO'S LEGACY SYSTEM INTERFACING

01:31:43.164 --> 01:31:44.599
WITH THE PASCAL SYSTEM AND

01:31:44.665 --> 01:31:46.300
TRANSACTIONS ARE FLYING BACK AND

01:31:46.367 --> 01:31:50.938
FORTH AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT

01:31:51.005 --> 01:31:52.073
HAS CAUSED A LOT MORE NEED FOR

01:31:52.139 --> 01:31:52.440
RECONCILIATION.

01:31:52.506 --> 01:31:52.907
THERE'S A MUCH HIGHER

01:31:52.974 --> 01:31:53.541
RECONCILIATION WORKLOAD BECAUSE

01:31:53.608 --> 01:31:53.808
OF THAT.

01:31:53.875 --> 01:31:55.209
AND REALLY WERE TRYING TO FORCE

01:31:55.276 --> 01:31:56.344
TO SYSTEMS TO TALK TO EACH OTHER

01:31:56.410 --> 01:31:57.011
THAT.

01:31:57.078 --> 01:31:57.545
SOMETHING OTHER WHATEVER

01:31:57.612 --> 01:31:59.080
DESIGNED TO DO SO YOU CAN

01:31:59.146 --> 01:32:00.448
UNDERSTAND HOW COMPLEX THAT IS

01:32:00.514 --> 01:32:01.182
AS WELL.

01:32:01.249 --> 01:32:03.618
SO ALL OF THAT TO SAY IS THAT

01:32:03.684 --> 01:32:04.218
WE'RE GETTING THERE AND BUT IT

01:32:04.285 --> 01:32:04.986
HAS.

01:32:05.052 --> 01:32:06.554
WE HAD HAD BUMPS IN THE ROAD AND

01:32:06.621 --> 01:32:08.022
THAT ISN'T SOMETHING THAT WERE

01:32:08.089 --> 01:32:10.458
SURPRISED ABOUT TO BE HONEST

01:32:10.524 --> 01:32:11.092
WITH YOU BUT WE ARE COMMITTED TO

01:32:11.158 --> 01:32:16.464
SEEING THIS THROUGH.

01:32:16.530 --> 01:32:16.764
IF YOU LIKE.

01:32:16.831 --> 01:32:18.733
TO AT RIGHT MISS BAILEY -- WE

01:32:18.799 --> 01:32:20.001
DID PROVIDE A HAND UP FOR YOU

01:32:20.067 --> 01:32:21.102
ALL BUT GIVEN THE LARGE AMOUNT

01:32:21.168 --> 01:32:22.270
OF GROUND WE'VE COVERED ALREADY

01:32:22.336 --> 01:32:23.037
WILL TRY TO KEEP OUR COMMENTS

01:32:23.104 --> 01:32:24.705
SHORT -- JUST WANNA NOTE

01:32:24.772 --> 01:32:25.940
REGARDING KIND OF THE THE

01:32:26.007 --> 01:32:28.476
PROJECT PLAN WE ARE CURRENTLY

01:32:28.542 --> 01:32:29.977
WORKING UNDER S. P. R. SEVEN WE

01:32:30.044 --> 01:32:32.013
KNOW S. P. R. EIGHT IS -- UNDER

01:32:32.079 --> 01:32:34.482
REVIEW AND APPROVAL BY C. T. --

01:32:34.548 --> 01:32:35.449
BUT WE WOULD NOTE THAT UNDER S.

01:32:35.516 --> 01:32:37.852
PAIR SEVEN JULY TWENTY NINETEEN

01:32:37.919 --> 01:32:38.686
WAS ESTABLISHED AS THE END DATE

01:32:38.753 --> 01:32:40.655
FOR THE PROJECT AND AS WE NOTED

01:32:40.721 --> 01:32:42.023
IN OUR ANALYSIS WE FOUND THAT TO

01:32:42.089 --> 01:32:43.791
BE A RATHER ARBITRARY IN DAY FOR

01:32:43.858 --> 01:32:45.092
THE PROJECT GIVEN YOU DO HAVE

01:32:45.159 --> 01:32:46.494
ALL THESE DEFERRED DEPARTMENTS

01:32:46.560 --> 01:32:46.761
THAT ARE.

01:32:46.827 --> 01:32:48.629
GONNA BE COMING ON AFTERWARDS AS

01:32:48.696 --> 01:32:49.964
WELL AS YOU'RE SEEING NOW BUDGET

01:32:50.031 --> 01:32:51.766
CHANGE PROPOSALS COMING IN TO

01:32:51.832 --> 01:32:52.800
GIVE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES

01:32:52.867 --> 01:32:54.168
DEPARTMENTS ACTUALLY USE THE

01:32:54.235 --> 01:32:55.469
SYSTEM AND SO THEY'RE GOING TO

01:32:55.536 --> 01:32:56.704
BE CONTINUING COSTS FOR THIS

01:32:56.771 --> 01:32:58.072
PROJECT GOING FORWARD.

01:32:58.139 --> 01:32:59.407
WE ALSO WOULDN'T WANT TO GLOSS

01:32:59.473 --> 01:33:00.741
OVER THE FACT THAT THE

01:33:00.808 --> 01:33:01.776
INTEGRATED SOLUTION IS STILL

01:33:01.842 --> 01:33:03.144
UNDER DEVELOPMENT THOUGH THIS

01:33:03.210 --> 01:33:05.413
PROJECT IS STILL A HUMAN CHANGE

01:33:05.479 --> 01:33:06.647
MANAGEMENT EFFORT.

01:33:06.714 --> 01:33:07.682
INTEGRATED SOLUTION IS A

01:33:07.748 --> 01:33:09.550
CRITICAL PART OF THE PROJECT AND

01:33:09.617 --> 01:33:10.851
THERE ARE STABILIZATION AND

01:33:10.918 --> 01:33:13.020
SUPPORT EFFORTS UNDER WAY FOR

01:33:13.087 --> 01:33:14.422
THAT TO WORK FOR THINGS THAT

01:33:14.488 --> 01:33:15.890
HAVE ALREADY BEEN DEPLOYED AND

01:33:15.957 --> 01:33:17.625
THERE IS ADDITIONAL WORK TO DO

01:33:17.692 --> 01:33:19.360
FOR THE REMAINING MILESTONES --

01:33:19.427 --> 01:33:21.195
WE DO ALSO WANT TO NOTE AGAIN AS

01:33:21.262 --> 01:33:22.296
THE DIRECTOR MENTIONED THE

01:33:22.363 --> 01:33:23.531
ISSUES AROUND THE MONTH AND YEAR

01:33:23.597 --> 01:33:25.232
AND CLOSE OF FINANCIAL

01:33:25.299 --> 01:33:27.535
STATEMENTS -- IN SEVENTEEN

01:33:27.601 --> 01:33:28.102
EIGHTEEN THERE ARE AT LEAST

01:33:28.169 --> 01:33:29.470
FIFTEEN DEPARTMENTS THAT HAD TO

01:33:29.537 --> 01:33:30.938
SUBMIT ESTIMATED STATEMENTS

01:33:31.005 --> 01:33:31.872
ACCORDING THE STEERING COMMITTEE

01:33:31.939 --> 01:33:34.275
DOCUMENTS IT LOOKS LIKE AT LEAST

01:33:34.342 --> 01:33:35.209
FORTY FIVE DEPARTMENTS COULD BE

01:33:35.276 --> 01:33:37.979
SUBMITTING ESTIMATES. FOR

01:33:38.045 --> 01:33:38.612
EIGHTEEN NINETEEN TO THE EXTENT

01:33:38.679 --> 01:33:39.113
THAT THERE ARE CONTINUE

01:33:39.180 --> 01:33:40.748
CHALLENGES USING THE SYSTEM THAT

01:33:40.815 --> 01:33:43.351
NUMBER COULD GO UP -- AND THOSE

01:33:43.417 --> 01:33:44.585
DEPARTMENTS THAT WERE UNABLE TO

01:33:44.652 --> 01:33:46.253
CLOSE FOR SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN ARE

01:33:46.320 --> 01:33:47.989
CONTINUING TO HAVE -- TROUBLE

01:33:48.055 --> 01:33:48.589
FOR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN SO THERE

01:33:48.656 --> 01:33:49.757
COULD BE ONGOING RAMIFICATIONS

01:33:49.824 --> 01:33:54.128
OF NOT CLOSING THE BOOKS ON TIME --

01:33:54.195 --> 01:33:54.729
WE ALSO AGAIN AS WE MENTIONED

01:33:54.795 --> 01:33:55.296
CONTINUE TO SEE REQUEST FOR

01:33:55.363 --> 01:33:56.764
ADDITIONAL FUNDING AND RESOURCES

01:33:56.831 --> 01:33:58.332
FOR DEPARTMENTS WE NOTED AT

01:33:58.399 --> 01:34:00.368
LEAST.

01:34:00.434 --> 01:34:00.935
TWELVE THREE NINETEEN TWENTY

01:34:01.002 --> 01:34:01.569
THOSE ARE NOT BEING CATALOGUED

01:34:01.635 --> 01:34:02.837
IN ANY CONSISTENT WAY AND ARE

01:34:02.903 --> 01:34:04.238
NOT CONSIDERED TO BE PART OF THE

01:34:04.305 --> 01:34:05.606
PROJECT COSTS THAT WE WOULD

01:34:05.673 --> 01:34:06.974
ANTICIPATE THEM BEING CONTINUING

01:34:07.041 --> 01:34:08.009
COSTS.

01:34:08.075 --> 01:34:10.044
AS YOU NEED TO AUGMENT RESOURCES

01:34:10.111 --> 01:34:12.346
FOR DEPARTMENTS -- AND AGAIN I

01:34:12.413 --> 01:34:14.181
THINK WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING FOR TO

01:34:14.248 --> 01:34:15.416
ANALYZING AS P. R. EIGHT AND

01:34:15.483 --> 01:34:16.517
PROVIDING ANALYSIS TO THE

01:34:16.584 --> 01:34:18.853
LEGISLATURE -- BUT AGAIN THOSE

01:34:18.919 --> 01:34:23.324
CONCERNS REMAIN FROM S. PAIR.

01:34:23.391 --> 01:34:24.525
SEVEN TO S. P. R. EIGHT AS IT'S

01:34:24.592 --> 01:34:25.693
BEEN SCOPED.

01:34:25.760 --> 01:34:27.661
OUT.

01:34:27.728 --> 01:34:30.698
HAS THE PROJECT COMPLETING JULY

01:34:30.765 --> 01:34:32.733
OF TWENTY TWENTY I BELIEVE.

01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:35.102
BASED ON OUR CONVERSATION ON THE

01:34:35.169 --> 01:34:36.237
NUMBER OF DEPARTMENTS THATHAVE

01:34:36.303 --> 01:34:37.505
BEEN DEFERRED.

01:34:37.571 --> 01:34:38.973
IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY SOUND LIKE

01:34:39.040 --> 01:34:40.241
IT'S GOING TO BE.

01:34:40.307 --> 01:34:41.842
COMPLETE BY JULY TWENTY TWENTY

01:34:41.909 --> 01:34:44.945
SO THE THE PROJECT AS IT IS YOU

01:34:45.012 --> 01:34:46.614
KNOW IDENTIFIED IN THE F. S. R.

01:34:46.680 --> 01:34:47.948
AND THEN THE SUBSEQUENT S. P.

01:34:48.015 --> 01:34:48.716
R.'S.

01:34:48.783 --> 01:34:50.317
IDENTIFIED A HUNDRED AND FIFTY

01:34:50.384 --> 01:34:52.219
TWO DEPARTMENTS TO BE UTILIZING

01:34:52.286 --> 01:34:54.855
THE SYSTEM AND THEN ALL OF THE

01:34:54.922 --> 01:34:55.990
FUNCTIONALITY TO BE BUILT.

01:34:56.057 --> 01:34:59.060
THAT IS THE FISCAL PROJECT.

01:34:59.126 --> 01:35:01.128
SO WHEN THAT IS DONE THAT'S NOT

01:35:01.195 --> 01:35:02.363
TO SAY THAT WE WILL NOT CONTINUE

01:35:02.430 --> 01:35:03.864
TO HAVE ENHANCEMENT WORK NOR

01:35:03.931 --> 01:35:05.199
DOES IT SAY THAT WE WILL NOT BE

01:35:05.266 --> 01:35:06.367
IN A POSITION TO HAVE TO ON

01:35:06.434 --> 01:35:07.735
BOARD DEPARTMENTS.

01:35:07.802 --> 01:35:09.970
AT A LATER DATE WHAT I DID YOU

01:35:10.037 --> 01:35:11.739
KNOW INDICATE WAS IT SURELY I

01:35:11.806 --> 01:35:13.641
WOULD NEED -- YOU KNOW BE SEE

01:35:13.707 --> 01:35:15.142
PEOPLE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO

01:35:15.209 --> 01:35:16.977
BRING ON SOME OF THESE LARGER --

01:35:17.044 --> 01:35:18.612
DEFERRED DEPARTMENTS WHAT MAY

01:35:18.679 --> 01:35:21.382
ALSO HAPPEN IS DEPENDING ON WHAT

01:35:21.449 --> 01:35:23.050
THAT GAP ANALYSIS SHOWS.

01:35:23.117 --> 01:35:24.351
IF I NEED TO DO ADDITIONAL

01:35:24.418 --> 01:35:26.520
FUNCTIONALITY OR CHANGE THE

01:35:26.587 --> 01:35:28.823
SYSTEM IN ANY SIGNIFICANT WAY

01:35:28.889 --> 01:35:30.524
BUT I WOULD ALSO AT THAT POINT

01:35:30.591 --> 01:35:33.661
TRIGGER ANOTHER -- PROJECT AND

01:35:33.727 --> 01:35:35.062
SO WE WOULD HAVE.

01:35:35.129 --> 01:35:36.497
THE PROJECT TO IMPLEMENT YOU

01:35:36.564 --> 01:35:37.431
KNOW EITHER.

01:35:37.498 --> 01:35:39.700
CDC ARE CALTRANS AND AND THAT

01:35:39.767 --> 01:35:42.169
WOULD BE TRACKED AND AND HAVE

01:35:42.236 --> 01:35:43.270
OVERSIGHT.

01:35:43.337 --> 01:35:44.705
ON ITS OWN AS A PROJECT OKAY SO

01:35:44.772 --> 01:35:45.773
YOU'RE SAYING THERE COULD BE A

01:35:45.840 --> 01:35:47.308
FIFTY CAL PHASE TWO OR PHASE

01:35:47.374 --> 01:35:50.010
CALIPHATES THREE AS IT WERE.

01:35:50.077 --> 01:35:52.279
AND THE MONEY THAT IS CURRENTLY

01:35:52.346 --> 01:35:54.748
IN THE BUDGET BELL I THINK IT'S

01:35:54.815 --> 01:35:56.250
MEN LIKE SIXTY FOUR MILLION

01:35:56.317 --> 01:35:56.917
DOLLARS OVER THE COURSE OF THE

01:35:56.984 --> 01:35:59.286
NEXT THREE YEARS [inaudible]

01:35:59.353 --> 01:36:01.388
THAT.

01:36:01.455 --> 01:36:04.391
DOES NOT COVERED THE ON BOARDING

01:36:04.458 --> 01:36:05.926
OF THAT ANY OF THESE DIFFERENT

01:36:05.993 --> 01:36:07.828
DEPARTMENTS OR ANY THE PROJECT

01:36:07.895 --> 01:36:09.697
COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT.

01:36:09.763 --> 01:36:10.965
CORRECT WE'RE NOT INCLUDE WELL

01:36:11.031 --> 01:36:12.700
THESE AND WE BELIEVE WE'RE GONNA

01:36:12.766 --> 01:36:14.301
BE ABLE TO BRING ON CD T. WITHIN

01:36:14.368 --> 01:36:16.070
EXISTING RESOURCES BECAUSE IT IS

01:36:16.137 --> 01:36:17.104
SUCH A SMALL DEPARTMENT.

01:36:17.171 --> 01:36:20.908

PARTNERS AGENCIES BACKGROUND --

01:42:40.888 --> 01:42:42.623
INTO SOME OF THOSE WE HAVE BEEN

01:42:42.689 --> 01:42:46.360
ABLE TO ADDRESS -- I THAT THE

01:42:46.426 --> 01:42:50.597
STABILIZATION WITH -- BESIDES.

01:42:50.664 --> 01:42:53.300
BESIDES THE THAT INTEGRATION I

01:42:53.367 --> 01:42:54.067
DON'T THINK THAT THERE IS

01:42:54.134 --> 01:42:56.303
ANYTHING LEFT ON ON MILESTONE TO

01:42:56.370 --> 01:42:57.271
WHITE AND I CAN GIVE YOU A

01:42:57.337 --> 01:42:59.206
SPECIFIC ITEM THAT THAT WAS DONE

01:42:59.273 --> 01:43:01.141
SO WHAT THE PROJECT IT IS THEY

01:43:01.208 --> 01:43:02.376
STREAMLINED THEIR BATCH

01:43:02.442 --> 01:43:03.277
PROCESSES.

01:43:03.343 --> 01:43:05.279
AND PARTLY THEY ACTUALLY BROKEN

01:43:05.345 --> 01:43:07.147
UP INTO SMALLER PIECES SO THAT

01:43:07.214 --> 01:43:08.382
WAS MORE EASILY TO HANDLE SO.

01:43:08.448 --> 01:43:10.250
IF YOU HAD A HUGE BATCH PROCESS

01:43:10.317 --> 01:43:11.084
THAT WAS RUNNING AND YOU HAD A

01:43:11.151 --> 01:43:13.086
PROBLEM SAY THREE QUARTERS OF

01:43:13.153 --> 01:43:14.021
THE WAY FACT IT WOULD CAUSE

01:43:14.087 --> 01:43:16.256
MAJOR PROBLEMS FOR THE BROKEN UP

01:43:16.323 --> 01:43:18.559
INTO SMALLER CHUNKS OF THAT.

01:43:18.625 --> 01:43:20.193
I'D BE MUCH MORE EFFICIENT.

01:43:20.260 --> 01:43:21.595
AT AND THEN THE RELEASE ONE INTO

01:43:21.662 --> 01:43:23.797
WHICH IS DEPLOYED IN DECEMBER.

01:43:23.864 --> 01:43:24.598
TWENTY EIGHTEEN IS THAT STILL

01:43:24.665 --> 01:43:26.066
EXPERIENCING CIVILIZATION ISSUES

01:43:26.133 --> 01:43:27.334
ARE HAVE THOSE BEEN RESOLVED

01:43:27.401 --> 01:43:29.136
ACTUALLY THOSE ARE RELATED TO

01:43:29.202 --> 01:43:31.238
MILESTONE TWO AND THREE THOSE

01:43:31.305 --> 01:43:31.872
ARE ALSO OKAY THOSE ARE RELATED

01:43:31.939 --> 01:43:34.141
[inaudible] FIVE AND THEN THE

01:43:34.207 --> 01:43:36.009
MOUSE AND FOUR AND FIVE WERE THE

01:43:36.076 --> 01:43:38.211
ONES THAT WERE RE BASS LINES.

01:43:38.278 --> 01:43:41.481
AND HE'S GOT A I GOT.

01:43:41.548 --> 01:43:43.517
SO WITH THAT I THINK PERHAPS WE

01:43:43.584 --> 01:43:45.986

01:43:46.053 --> 01:43:48.589

THOUGHT WOULD PROPOSE A

01:45:18.679 --> 01:45:19.713
THOUGHTFUL APPROACH WE'RE GONNA

01:45:19.780 --> 01:45:21.048
WE'RE GONNA SPEND THIS NEXT YEAR

01:45:21.114 --> 01:45:22.349
GETTING THEM READY.

01:45:22.416 --> 01:45:24.918
TO CUT OVER -- AND THEN WE'RE

01:45:24.985 --> 01:45:25.819
GONNA RUN THEIR SYSTEM PARALLEL.

01:45:25.886 --> 01:45:27.454
SO THEY CAN.

01:45:27.521 --> 01:45:28.355

CATHERINE AND HAVE AND HAVE THE

01:45:30.257 --> 01:45:31.758
CONFIDENCE THAT THAT WHAT'S BEEN

01:45:31.825 --> 01:45:32.693
WITHOUT ONE SYSTEM TYPES WHAT'S

01:45:32.759 --> 01:45:34.061
PRODUCED A LEGACY SYSTEM.

01:45:34.127 --> 01:45:35.228
AND AT THAT POINT WE CAN SHUT IT

01:45:35.295 --> 01:45:37.130
DOWN BUT I FEEL LIKE WE'RE IN A

01:45:37.197 --> 01:45:38.732
GOOD PLACE -- WE'VE LEARNED A

01:45:38.799 --> 01:45:41.735
LOT AND AND AND WITH THE HELP OF

01:45:41.802 --> 01:45:43.637
THE LEGISLATURE AS I SAID WE'RE

01:45:43.704 --> 01:45:44.905
WE'RE GET WEIRD BEEN DEPLOYING

01:45:44.971 --> 01:45:46.139
OUR RESOURCES MORE TARGETED TO

01:45:46.206 --> 01:45:47.574
HELP THOSE DEPARTMENTS WERE TO

01:45:47.641 --> 01:45:48.775
GET THE BEST VALUE -- AND WITH

01:45:48.842 --> 01:45:53.980
THE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES THAT

01:45:54.047 --> 01:45:55.215
THE LEGISLATURE.

01:45:55.282 --> 01:45:56.149
WAS NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO HELP US

01:45:56.216 --> 01:45:57.451
WITH IN THE SPRING -- WHEN THOSE

01:45:57.517 --> 01:45:58.785
COME ON BOARD UNTIL I WE'RE

01:45:58.852 --> 01:46:00.921
GOING TO DO THE SAME SO?

01:46:00.987 --> 01:46:02.856
AND THAT SOMETHING ELSE YOU

01:46:02.923 --> 01:46:03.523
WANNA TOWARD.

01:46:03.590 --> 01:46:04.291
YEAH THIRTY SETTER WITH FINANCE

01:46:04.357 --> 01:46:04.958
AND I'LL JUST ADD THAT -- WE'VE

01:46:05.025 --> 01:46:05.559
BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE

01:46:05.625 --> 01:46:06.326
PROJECT ON PROVIDING THAT

01:46:06.393 --> 01:46:07.728
ADDITIONAL TRAINING TO THE

01:46:07.794 --> 01:46:09.296
DEPARTMENTS TO HELP THEM GET

01:46:09.362 --> 01:46:11.098
CURRENT IN CLOSING WE THINK THAT

01:46:11.164 --> 01:46:13.233
THAT'LL BE A SUCCESS FACTOR WHEN

01:46:13.300 --> 01:46:14.534
IT'S TIME TO PRODUCE THE KAFIRS

01:46:14.601 --> 01:46:15.736
MAKING SURE THAT DEPARTMENTS ARE

01:46:15.802 --> 01:46:17.237
CLOSING IN A TIMELY MANNER.

01:46:17.304 --> 01:46:19.272
SO INVESTING A LOT OF TIME AND

01:46:19.339 --> 01:46:22.109
EFFORT INTO THEM.

01:46:22.175 --> 01:46:24.344
WHAT I WANT TO ADD IS THAT?

01:46:24.411 --> 01:46:26.079
ONCE WE'RE DONE I HAVE NO DOUBT

01:46:26.146 --> 01:46:27.881
THAT THIS WILL WORK.

01:46:27.948 --> 01:46:28.548
I THINK ONCE WE'RE DONE IT WILL

01:46:28.615 --> 01:46:30.150
WORK -- IT'S WORKED AT THE

01:46:30.217 --> 01:46:31.651
COUNTY LEVEL IT'S WORKED IN

01:46:31.718 --> 01:46:32.753
OTHER STATES.

01:46:32.819 --> 01:46:33.553
EVEN THE WERE MUCH MORE

01:46:33.620 --> 01:46:35.155

WE HAVE STARTED THAT. TO TAKE

01:47:41.521 --> 01:47:42.055

01:47:42.722 --> 01:47:43.290
TABLED FOR THAT SO.

01:47:43.356 --> 01:47:44.357
ARE THERE ENTITIES THAT ARE

01:47:44.424 --> 01:47:46.059

01:47:58.672 --> 01:47:59.906
THAT HAS RAISE THAT CONCERN IN

01:47:59.973 --> 01:48:01.341
IN MAY AND MAY STILL BE A LITTLE

01:48:01.408 --> 01:48:03.343
BIT CURRENT HIS PARCEL SERVICES

01:48:04.511 --> 01:48:05.812
USING CAL STARS.

01:48:05.879 --> 01:48:06.913
AND THEY WANTED TO USE THAT IN

01:48:06.980 --> 01:48:08.849
PART TO HELP THEM VALIDATE THE

01:48:08.915 --> 01:48:11.084

01:48:13.286 --> 01:48:14.654
INDICATION FROM THEM THAT THEY

01:48:14.721 --> 01:48:16.256

WAS SOMETHING THAT THEY IT WAS A

01:48:17.524 --> 01:48:18.892
TOOL THAT THEY WANTED TO USE TO

01:48:18.959 --> 01:48:20.460
HELP THEM ENSURE.

01:48:20.527 --> 01:48:21.261
THAT THEY COULD CONTINUE TO

01:48:21.328 --> 01:48:22.662
PROVIDE THAT FED THE FEDERAL

01:48:22.729 --> 01:48:24.364
REPORTING.

01:48:24.431 --> 01:48:25.031
OKAY SO THEY'RE KIND OF RUNNING

01:48:25.098 --> 01:48:28.535
TO DO ALL APPROACH THAT AT THE

01:48:28.602 --> 01:48:28.768
MOMENT.

01:48:28.835 --> 01:48:29.936

01:48:30.003 --> 01:48:31.204
I'M AND THEN.

01:48:31.271 --> 01:48:33.540
AGAIN BACK TO THE QUESTION OF

01:48:33.607 --> 01:48:35.876
SORT OF LEVEL OF DETAIL.

01:48:35.942 --> 01:48:38.511
THAT -- THAT THIS GAL THE SYSTEM

01:48:38.578 --> 01:48:40.280
IS CAPABLE OF SO I THINK THE

01:48:40.347 --> 01:48:41.615
DIRECTORIES AS THE EXAMPLE OF OF

01:48:41.681 --> 01:48:43.617
APPLE APPLES RIGHT SO IF YOU'RE

01:48:43.683 --> 01:48:44.885
CLASSIFYING SAVVY CAN.

01:48:44.951 --> 01:48:47.320
NEW START WITH FOOD AND FRUIT

01:48:47.387 --> 01:48:51.024
AND VEGETABLES APPLES YOU HAVE

01:48:51.091 --> 01:48:54.027
GALA APPLES OR YOU CAN EXPRESS.

01:48:54.094 --> 01:48:55.028
HOW?

01:48:55.095 --> 01:48:56.529
LIKE WE HAVE TO HAVE A AN

01:48:56.596 --> 01:48:58.365
APPROACH TO SELECTING WHAT LEVEL

01:48:58.431 --> 01:49:00.066
OF GRANULARITY WE WANT AND MAKE

01:49:00.133 --> 01:49:02.102
SURE THAT ALL DEPARTMENTS ARE

01:49:02.168 --> 01:49:03.637
THAN USING THAT SAME LEVEL OF

01:49:03.703 --> 01:49:04.971
GRANULARITY.

01:49:05.038 --> 01:49:06.673
THAT ACTUALLY STRIKES ME AS

01:49:06.740 --> 01:49:07.908
QUITE A MASSIVE.

01:49:07.974 --> 01:49:10.143
UNDERTAKING WHAT IS OUR APPROACH

01:49:10.210 --> 01:49:12.345
TO THAT RIGHT NOW AND AND HOW

01:49:12.412 --> 01:49:13.980
ARE WE INSURING THAT SAM.

01:49:14.047 --> 01:49:16.516
THE DEPARTMENTS ARE GOING TO BE

01:49:16.583 --> 01:49:18.551
OPERATING IN UNIFORM FASHION.

01:49:18.618 --> 01:49:20.787
WELL I'LL TAKE A FIRST CUT AT IT --

01:49:20.854 --> 01:49:22.822
OUR APPROACH WAS THAT TO BE

01:49:22.889 --> 01:49:24.090
HONEST WITH YOU THAT.

01:49:24.157 --> 01:49:24.724
WE GOT CAUGHT OFF GUARD -- BUT

01:49:24.791 --> 01:49:26.626
BY THE LEVEL OF DETAIL IN ON THE

01:49:26.693 --> 01:49:28.128
PROCUREMENT SIDE AND THE THE

01:49:28.194 --> 01:49:29.095
WORKLOAD THAT THEY PUT ON A

01:49:29.162 --> 01:49:30.764
DEPARTMENTS AND SO AS A STEERING

01:49:30.830 --> 01:49:32.332
COMMITTEE AS IS CONTROL AGENCIES

01:49:32.399 --> 01:49:33.433
WE CAME TOGETHER SO WHAT WE DO

01:49:33.500 --> 01:49:34.234
ABOUT THIS AND SO WE BACK

01:49:34.301 --> 01:49:35.635
CUSTOMERS REQUIREMENTS IN THE

01:49:35.702 --> 01:49:36.369
SHORT TERM.

01:49:36.436 --> 01:49:37.737
SO WE DIDN'T CRUSH THE STATE'S

01:49:37.804 --> 01:49:40.507
BECOME A PROCESS -- WELL WE'RE

01:49:40.573 --> 01:49:42.108
WORKING TOGETHER TO D. G. S. AND

01:49:42.175 --> 01:49:43.343
CONTROLLER IN PARTICULAR BUT

01:49:43.410 --> 01:49:44.778
WHAT WE'RE INVOLVED THE IT'S

01:49:44.844 --> 01:49:46.546
IT'S IT'S IT'S NOT A PROJECT

01:49:46.613 --> 01:49:47.747
ISSUE PER SE IT'S MORE OF A

01:49:47.814 --> 01:49:49.783
POLICY CALL -- BUT WE'RE WORKING

01:49:49.849 --> 01:49:50.884
TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE WE FIND

01:49:50.951 --> 01:49:52.218
WHAT WHAT IS BUT WE DO WE THINK

01:49:52.285 --> 01:49:53.453
THAT RIGHT LEVEL DETAIL IS AN

01:49:53.520 --> 01:49:54.654
AND ONCE WEEK SORT OF LAND THAT

01:49:54.721 --> 01:49:55.622
WE WILL ENGAGE WITH THE

01:49:55.689 --> 01:49:56.823
LEGISLATURE -- BECAUSE YOU HAVE

01:49:56.890 --> 01:49:58.058
SOME EXPECTATIONS OF OF

01:49:58.124 --> 01:49:59.225
TRANSPARENCY OUT OF THE SYSTEM

01:49:59.292 --> 01:50:01.861
AND AND WE'RE SHOWCASING SOME OF

01:50:01.928 --> 01:50:03.596
THAT IN A PILOT RIGHT NOW OF ON

01:50:03.663 --> 01:50:05.365
THE PROCUREMENT SIDE LIKE.

01:50:05.432 --> 01:50:06.666
WHAT DEPARTMENTS PURCHASE AT A

01:50:06.733 --> 01:50:09.803
VERY GRANULAR LEVEL DETAIL -- SO

01:50:09.869 --> 01:50:10.537
IN THAT CONTEXT WE WOULD WE

01:50:10.603 --> 01:50:14.474
WOULD COME BACK AND HAVE A

01:50:14.541 --> 01:50:15.809
CONVERSATION ABOUT.

01:50:15.875 --> 01:50:17.010
YOU KNOW WHAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:50:17.077 --> 01:50:17.911
THINKS IS RIGHT LEVEL DETAIL BUT

01:50:17.978 --> 01:50:19.446
YOU KNOW WE WE DON'T THANK LEAST

01:50:19.512 --> 01:50:20.046
FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE WE DON'T

01:50:20.113 --> 01:50:20.613
THINK IT THESE IN THE APPLE

01:50:20.680 --> 01:50:21.715
ANALOGY THAT'S THAT'S BEEN USED

01:50:21.781 --> 01:50:23.350
FAR TOO OFTEN BUT BUT BUT WE

01:50:23.416 --> 01:50:24.751
DON'T THINK IT MATTERS IF IT'S A

01:50:24.818 --> 01:50:25.585
GREEN APPLE OR FOOD.

01:50:25.652 --> 01:50:27.654
THE APPLE OR MACINTOSH APPLE OR

01:50:27.721 --> 01:50:30.256
OR BRAEBURN YOU KNOW THAT --

01:50:30.323 --> 01:50:31.891
IT'S WHAT WHAT WHAT THAT WHAT

01:50:31.958 --> 01:50:33.927
WHAT FOOD WE BUYING FOR OUR

01:50:33.994 --> 01:50:34.594
TWENTY FOUR HOUR CARE FACILITIES

01:50:34.661 --> 01:50:35.996
OUR PRISONS AND HOW MUCH WE'RE

01:50:36.062 --> 01:50:37.130
PAYING FOR IT WHERE WE SOURCING

01:50:37.197 --> 01:50:38.498
IT AND WE GETTING THE BEST VALUE

01:50:38.565 --> 01:50:39.332
FOR THE STATEMENT THAT'S THAT'S

01:50:39.399 --> 01:50:40.867
A SORT INFORMATION THAT WE NEED

01:50:40.934 --> 01:50:43.103
TO NOW -- IS AN ADMINISTRATION

01:50:43.169 --> 01:50:43.670
THAT THE LEGISLATURE I WOULD

01:50:43.737 --> 01:50:45.138
ASSUME WANTS TO KNOW FROM AN

01:50:45.205 --> 01:50:47.040
OVERSIGHT PERSPECTIVE ON AND AND

01:50:47.107 --> 01:50:48.041
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING WE'RE

01:50:48.108 --> 01:50:48.942
TRYING TO THREAD THAT NEEDLE IF

01:50:49.009 --> 01:50:49.976
YOU WILL RIGHT AND THEN IT'S

01:50:50.043 --> 01:50:51.044
JUST ENSURING THAT THAN THE

01:50:51.111 --> 01:50:52.679
BUSINESS ROLES ARE.

01:50:52.746 --> 01:50:54.214
THE SENATE WILL ENSURE THE

01:50:54.280 --> 01:50:55.148
BUSINESS RULES THAT THEY WON'T

01:50:55.215 --> 01:50:56.182
BE ABLE TO SAY WHAT AND THAT'S

01:50:56.249 --> 01:50:58.318
THAT'S THAT'S WHY IT BECAME AN

01:50:58.385 --> 01:51:02.856
ISSUE ON THE FRONT END AND HAVE.

01:51:02.922 --> 01:51:04.391
THE RIGHT.

01:51:04.457 --> 01:51:05.725
AND ON THE BACK AND IT'S ALSO

01:51:05.792 --> 01:51:06.726
GOING TO FOLLOW IN OUR CLAREMONT

01:51:06.793 --> 01:51:07.694
IT'S FOLKS WHEN THEY'RE

01:51:07.761 --> 01:51:08.428
APPROVING THE VOUCHERS FOR

01:51:08.495 --> 01:51:09.229
PAYMENT THEY'RE GONNA WANT TO

01:51:09.295 --> 01:51:09.929
SEE THE DETAILS.

01:51:09.996 --> 01:51:11.264
AS WELL SO THE SYSTEM GONNA

01:51:11.331 --> 01:51:12.065
REQUIRED THEN THEY'RE GONNA

01:51:12.132 --> 01:51:12.699
MIGHT BE SURE THAT IT'S IN THE

01:51:12.766 --> 01:51:13.366
VOUCHER INFORMATION BEFORE THEY

01:51:13.433 --> 01:51:14.868
ACTUALLY ALLOW THAT WARRANT TO

01:51:14.934 --> 01:51:16.770
BE ISSUED.

01:51:16.836 --> 01:51:18.104
AB AND I THINK ONE LAST QUESTION

01:51:18.171 --> 01:51:20.273
FOR ME ON THIS ON ON THIS TOPIC

01:51:20.340 --> 01:51:21.941
THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE

01:51:22.008 --> 01:51:23.643
MENTIONED THAT THERE FORTY FIVE

01:51:23.710 --> 01:51:25.311
DEPARTMENTS -- THE REASON

01:51:25.378 --> 01:51:27.313
ESTIMATES FOR CLOSING I BELIEVE

01:51:27.380 --> 01:51:28.281
IS THE NUMBER.

01:51:28.348 --> 01:51:31.117
DOES THAT GIVE YOU PAUSE OR A

01:51:31.184 --> 01:51:35.455
CAUSE FOR CONCERN.

01:51:35.522 --> 01:51:36.689
SO AS AN ACCOUNTANT I CAN NEVER

01:51:36.756 --> 01:51:38.525
SAY THAT THAT ONE GIVE ME CAUSE

01:51:38.591 --> 01:51:40.360
FOR CONCERN BUT ESTIMATES

01:51:40.427 --> 01:51:41.528
ANOTHER NEW THINGS WE'VE HAD

01:51:41.594 --> 01:51:42.695
DEPARTMENTS DOING ESTIMATES IN

01:51:42.762 --> 01:51:43.930
THEIR OLD LEGACY SYSTEMS FOR A

01:51:43.997 --> 01:51:45.999
VARIETY OF REASONS AS WELL --

01:51:46.066 --> 01:51:47.667
NOT AS MANY GRANTED BUT IT HAS

01:51:47.734 --> 01:51:49.069
HAPPENED IT'S NOT A NEW THING.

01:51:49.135 --> 01:51:50.570
UP THE DEPARTMENT ARE GOING TO

01:51:50.637 --> 01:51:52.639
DO ESTIMATES THIS YEAR ARE NOT

01:51:52.705 --> 01:51:53.506
MATERIAL.

01:51:53.573 --> 01:51:54.774
FROM MY POINT OF VIEW NOW

01:51:54.841 --> 01:51:56.109
WHETHER THE STATE AUDITOR AGREES

01:51:56.176 --> 01:51:58.078
WITH THAT STATEMENT.

01:51:58.144 --> 01:52:00.013
IT'S GOING TO BE THEIR CALL.

01:52:00.080 --> 01:52:01.815
I THINK WE'LL BE FINE BUT HAVING

01:52:01.881 --> 01:52:03.016
ESTIMATES IS NOT NECESSARILY A

01:52:03.083 --> 01:52:04.084
BAD THING AS LONG AS THEY CAN

01:52:04.150 --> 01:52:05.518
DEFEND THOSE ESTIMATES AND WHEN

01:52:05.585 --> 01:52:06.653
THE AUDITOR WALKS INTO THEIR

01:52:06.719 --> 01:52:07.787
OFFICE TO SAY HEY.

01:52:07.854 --> 01:52:09.055
YOU GUYS PROVIDED ESTIMATES HOW

01:52:09.122 --> 01:52:10.790
DID YOU COME UP WITH THAT SHOW

01:52:10.857 --> 01:52:11.858
ME HOW YOU CAME UP WITH IT.

01:52:11.925 --> 01:52:13.660
AND SEE IF THEY'RE SATISFIED IF

01:52:13.726 --> 01:52:15.061
THEY CAN SATISFY THE AUDITOR.

01:52:15.128 --> 01:52:17.230
WILL BE FINE -- BUT AGAIN

01:52:17.297 --> 01:52:18.431
ESTIMATES ARE NOT A NEW THING

01:52:18.498 --> 01:52:20.333
HOPEFULLY THEY'LL BE MINIMAL AND

01:52:20.400 --> 01:52:21.201
HOPEFULLY AS WE MOVE FORWARD

01:52:21.267 --> 01:52:23.636
WILL HAVE LESS AND LESS AND

01:52:23.703 --> 01:52:25.939
HOPEFULLY AT SOME POINT.

01:52:26.005 --> 01:52:27.540
NINE AND I JUST LIKE TO ADD THAT --

01:52:27.607 --> 01:52:28.708
ONE OF THE EFFORTS BROKE THAT

01:52:28.775 --> 01:52:29.876
ARE CURRENTLY UNDER WAY IS TO

01:52:29.943 --> 01:52:31.111
WORK CLOSELY WITH THE CONTROLLER

01:52:31.177 --> 01:52:32.645
AND THE STATE AUDITOR. TO

01:52:32.712 --> 01:52:34.247
PROVIDE ADDITIONAL GUIDELINES TO

01:52:34.314 --> 01:52:35.315
DEPARTMENTS WHO HAVE TO DO

01:52:35.381 --> 01:52:36.850
ESTIMATES TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE

01:52:36.916 --> 01:52:37.717
DONE.

01:52:37.784 --> 01:52:40.086
ACCURATELY ACCURACY IS THE MOST

01:52:40.153 --> 01:52:42.755
IMPORTANT THING IN REGARDS TO

01:52:42.822 --> 01:52:44.357
THOSE ESTIMATES -- EVERY

01:52:44.424 --> 01:52:46.025
DEPARTMENT USES ESTIMATES FOR

01:52:46.092 --> 01:52:47.627
YOUR AND REPORTING PURPOSES THE

01:52:47.694 --> 01:52:48.828
DIFFERENCE WITH THE DEPARTMENTS

01:52:48.895 --> 01:52:49.629
ARE A LITTLE BIT BEHIND OF

01:52:49.696 --> 01:52:50.830
FISCALES ARE AT A DIFFERENT

01:52:50.897 --> 01:52:52.232
STARTING POINT.

01:52:52.298 --> 01:52:54.000
SO WHICH COULD HELP THEM KIND OF

01:52:54.067 --> 01:52:57.070
DEFECTIVE DEVELOP THAT PROCESS

01:52:57.137 --> 01:53:00.540
AND ENSURE THAT IT'S ACCURATE.

01:53:00.607 --> 01:53:03.443
ANYTHING ELSE THAT YOU WOULD ADD.

01:53:03.510 --> 01:53:06.579
JUST IN TERMS OF OF OVERSIGHT.

01:53:06.646 --> 01:53:08.548
I IN THE CONTEXT OF A SCALE.

01:53:08.615 --> 01:53:10.083
NO I WOULD I WOULD SAY -- YOU

01:53:10.150 --> 01:53:11.718

01:53:15.688 --> 01:53:17.190
HAVE ONGOING DIALOGUE ABOUT THIS

01:53:17.257 --> 01:53:18.925
PROJECT WE APPRECIATE THE

01:53:18.992 --> 01:53:20.560
LEGISLATURE SUPPORT.

01:53:20.627 --> 01:53:21.761
THE MOVE WE'VE BEEN HERE A

01:53:21.828 --> 01:53:23.229
COUPLE OF TIMES YOU KNOW HADN'T

01:53:23.296 --> 01:53:24.631
HAND ASKING FOR ADDITIONAL

01:53:24.697 --> 01:53:26.299
RESOURCES BRING US AND CROSS THE

01:53:26.366 --> 01:53:27.267
FINISH LINE AND AND LET SUCH AS

01:53:27.333 --> 01:53:28.635
BEEN EVERY TIME SO WE THANK YOU

01:53:28.701 --> 01:53:31.070
FOR THAT AND WE LOOK FORWARD.

01:53:31.137 --> 01:53:32.205

TUNG WHERE WE ARE AND HAVING

01:53:36.109 --> 01:53:36.576
THEM CONTINUOUS PRODUCTIVE

01:53:36.643 --> 01:53:37.944
CONVERSATION.

01:53:38.011 --> 01:53:39.212
WELL THANK YOU AND THANK YOU AND

01:53:39.279 --> 01:53:40.313

JOIN US TWENTIES TODAY AND AND

01:53:41.314 --> 01:53:42.448
TAKING TIME TO UPDATE THE

01:53:42.515 --> 01:53:43.516
COMMITTEE.

01:53:43.583 --> 01:53:45.485
COMMITTEES ON ON THE PROJECT

01:53:45.552 --> 01:53:46.085
STATUS.

01:53:46.152 --> 01:53:48.755
I THINK I'M FROM MY PERSPECTIVE.

01:53:48.821 --> 01:53:49.822
THINK LIKE WE SAID THIS IS HAS

01:53:49.889 --> 01:53:52.692
BEEN A TRULY MASSIVE UNDERTAKING

01:53:52.759 --> 01:53:54.460
FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- I

01:53:54.527 --> 01:53:56.262
THINK A LOT HAS BEEN

01:53:56.329 --> 01:53:57.564
ACCOMPLISHED WE'VE CERTAINLY.

01:53:57.630 --> 01:53:59.699
SOUNDS LIKE WE HAVE A A FAIR

01:53:59.766 --> 01:54:01.501
WAYS TO GO WHEN YOU THINK OF

01:54:01.568 --> 01:54:03.136
THAT IN THE CONTEXT OF OF THE

01:54:03.203 --> 01:54:04.437
THE SUBSEQUENT FACE SAYS.

01:54:04.504 --> 01:54:06.039
AND I WAS STRUCK IN YOUR

01:54:06.105 --> 01:54:07.874
TESTIMONY I THINK BY THE NUMBER

01:54:07.941 --> 01:54:08.975
OF LESSONS.

01:54:09.042 --> 01:54:10.577
THE REASONS THAT WE'VE LEARNED

01:54:10.643 --> 01:54:11.778
OVER THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS.

01:54:11.844 --> 01:54:15.515
AND MUCH WITH THE PROCESS IS TO

01:54:15.582 --> 01:54:17.483
ENSURE THAT WE DON'T MAKE THE

01:54:17.550 --> 01:54:18.985
SAME MISTAKES ON UP TO KEEP

01:54:19.052 --> 01:54:20.620
RELEARNING THOSE LESSONS RIGHT

01:54:20.687 --> 01:54:21.254
BECAUSE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

01:54:21.321 --> 01:54:22.422
WE'RE GOING.

01:54:22.488 --> 01:54:25.358
TO KEEP ON TAKING ON GIGANTIC.

01:54:25.425 --> 01:54:27.427
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND OTHER

01:54:27.493 --> 01:54:29.195
LARGE SCALE PROJECTS AND I THINK

01:54:29.262 --> 01:54:30.230
SOME OF THE THINGS YOU

01:54:30.296 --> 01:54:31.998
HIGHLIGHTED AROUND.

01:54:32.065 --> 01:54:33.499
FACT THAT YEAH IT'S NEVER JUST A

01:54:33.566 --> 01:54:35.501
TECHNOLOGY PROJECT IT'S A IT'S A

01:54:35.568 --> 01:54:37.136
HUGE CHANGE MANAGEMENT PROJECT.

01:54:37.203 --> 01:54:39.439
THAT IS SO IMPORTANT -- SOME OF

01:54:39.505 --> 01:54:40.373
THE THINGS YOU TALKED ABOUT.

01:54:40.440 --> 01:54:43.910
IN TERMS OF THE ROLL OUT AS AND

01:54:43.977 --> 01:54:46.012
VERY DIFFUSE PROJECT ACROSS MANY

01:54:46.079 --> 01:54:47.380
DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS AND SEEN

01:54:47.447 --> 01:54:48.648
THE SPIKY NESS.

01:54:48.715 --> 01:54:50.283
OF SIX ASSN FOR YOU'RE NOT A

01:54:50.350 --> 01:54:52.118
RIGHT ACTUALLY IF WE CAN ADOPT

01:54:52.185 --> 01:54:53.686
THIS IS A BEST PRACTICE.

01:54:53.753 --> 01:54:56.389
THEN WE CAN ENSURE THAT EVERYONE.

01:54:56.456 --> 01:54:57.957
IS HAVING A SUCCESSFUL ROLLOUT

01:54:58.024 --> 01:54:58.725
SO.

01:54:58.791 --> 01:54:59.926
I'M THE ONE THING THAT I THINK

01:54:59.993 --> 01:55:01.828
WOULD BE REALLY VERY VALUABLE IS

01:55:01.894 --> 01:55:04.430
PARTICULARLY AS WE HAVE THEY HI

01:55:04.497 --> 01:55:06.666

01:55:06.733 --> 01:55:08.167
THAT'S GONNA BE STARTING UP IS

01:55:08.234 --> 01:55:09.369
TO ENSURE THAT.

01:55:09.435 --> 01:55:11.304
AS THIS PROJECT WINDS DOWN THAT

01:55:11.371 --> 01:55:12.739
THERE'S A REALLY THOROUGH KIND

01:55:12.805 --> 01:55:15.008
OF DEBRIEF AND AND REFLECTION SO

01:55:15.074 --> 01:55:17.944
