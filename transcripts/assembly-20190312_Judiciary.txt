TUESDAY MARCH TWELFTH. AND WE DO NOT YET HAD TO HAVE A QUORUM BUT WE HAVE SUFFICIENT MEMBERS TO START AS A SUB COMMITTEE SO WE WILL DO JUST THAT. AND OUR FIRST BILL IS GOING TO BE MR GABRIEL SO WE'LL START WITH ITEM NUMBER SIX AB FOR TWENTY FOUR HI GOOD MORNING THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I AM PLEASED TODAY TO PRESENT A. B.. FOUR TWO FOUR WHICH CLARIFIES EXISTING LAW REGARDING THE ADMISSIBILITY OF CERTAIN DEPOSITION TRANSCRIPTS. AS YOU MAY BE AWARE CALIFORNIA IS CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING A SHORTAGE OF LICENSE COURT REPORTERS. THIS SORTED SHORTAGE HAS CAUSED MANY ATTORNEYS TO RELY ON UNLICENSED VIDEOGRAPHERS TO RECORD THEIR DEPOSITIONS WITH THE TRANSCRIPT TO BE PREPARED AT A LATER DATE. VIDEOTAPED DEPOSITIONS ARE ADMISSIBLE IN COURT UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS BUT CONFUSION EXISTS ABOUT WHO MAY LAWFULLY TRANSCRIBE RECORDED DEPOSITIONS AND WHAT IS REQUIRED TO ENSURE THAT TRANSCRIPTS OF THOSE DEPOSITIONS. CAN BE ADMITTED WITHOUT CONTROVERSY AB FOR TWO FOUR RESOLVES THIS CONFUSION BY AMENDING THE CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE. TO CLARIFY THAT ONLY A CALIFORNIA LICENSED COURT REPORTER MAY STENOGRAPHY TRANSCRIBE RECORDED DEPOSITION. THIS BILL PROTECTS THE PUBLIC IN THAT AGAINST BY ENSURING THE TRANSCRIPTS FROM VIDEOTAPED DEPOSITIONS ARE PREPARED BY LICENSE REPORTERS WHO ARE COMPETENT QUALIFIED AND ACCOUNTABLE TO THE COURT REPORTERS BOARD. I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE AND WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS JAMES GROSS ON BEHALF OF THE DEPOSITION REPORTERS ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU FIRST WHEN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- MR GABRIEL SUMMARIZED IT VERY WELL -- THIS IS A IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION IT IS TECHNICAL BUT NONE THE LESS -- WILL ELIMINATE CONFUSION WITH -- BOTH THE VIDEO ARE GRAFFITI ITSELF AND WHO IS APPROPRIATE AND LEGALLY REQUIRED TO TRANSCRIBE IT WE ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. TWENTY GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN BIRDS ARE NOT YOUR HERNANDEZ ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA COURT REPORTERS ASSOCIATION. WE ARE KIND OF AN IN BETWEEN OPPOSITION RIGHT NOW AND I THINK ON THE SOMEONE NUMBER SO STAFF SPOKE YESTERDAY ALSO THE SPONSORS WILL START CONVERSATIONS. WOULD YOU SUPPORT THE CONCEPT. OF THIS BILL WE DO BELIEVE THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME CLARIFICATION SOME WORK DONE IN THIS AREA -- TO PROTECT THE INTEGRITY OF THE TRANSCRIPT AND VIDEO -- ONLY A DEPOSITION PROCEEDINGS -- WE DO HAVE SOME IDEAS ON ON MAYBE SOME -- STRONGER OR EVEN MORE EFFECTIVE WAYS TO DO THAT -- SO WE'LL CONTINUE OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHOR THE SPONSOR HOPEFULLY WE GET TO A POINT TO BE OFFICIALLY SUPPORT WE DO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT -- OR ASSOCIATION HAS A LITTLE DIFFERENT TAKE ON THE DRIVERS OF A PERCEIVED -- VARIOUS COUNTIES FOR OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER POSITIONS FOR EXAMPLE WE ALSO SEEN. OF A VAST ARRAY OF A REPORTERS AVAILABLE FOR DEPOSITIONS BUT THERE ARE SOME STRUCTURAL -- ISSUES SO WE WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THERE IS IS A LARGE OF A PERCEIVED. AS AS SOME FOLKS MAY SAY -- BUT WE DO THINK THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE WORKING ON THIS VIDEO DEPOSITION ARENA SO WE DO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHORED SPONSOR TO GETTING TO SUPPORT POSITION AND I THANK THEM FOR BRINGING THE BILL. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT OR IN BETWEEN. SEEING NONE IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION. MORNING GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS KATHY DE LORENZO I'M THE DIRECTOR OF COURT REPORTING WITH PLANET DUBOSE. A COURT REPORTING FIRM WITH BUSINESS INTERESTS HERE IN CALIFORNIA -- I HAVE BEEN. STENNETT GRAPHICALLY TRAINED AND CREDENTIALED AS A COURT REPORTER AND HAVE BEEN IN THE BUSINESS FOR NEARLY FORTY YEARS. THE SHORTAGE. IN THE COURT REPORTING PROFESSION ISRAEL I HAVE COPIES OF THE REPORT HERE THAT WAS COMMISSIONED BY THE NATIONAL COURT REPORTERS ASSOCIATION BACK IN TWENTY THIRTEEN I DO HAVE COPIES AVAILABLE. THE SHORTAGE IS ACKNOWLEDGED AS THE SPONSOR SAID BY. AGENCIES ACROSS THE UNITED STATES WHO ARE EAGER TO COVER THEIR CALENDARS ALSO THE THE D. R. A. THE SPONSOR OF THE BILL STATE ASSOCIATIONS AS WELL AS THE NATIONAL COURT REPORTERS ASSOCIATION. IN TWENTY THIRTEEN THE REPORT CONCLUDED THAT THERE WOULD BE FIFTY FIVE HUNDRED OPEN POSITIONS. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND HE DID RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA SINCE THAT TIME THREE HUNDRED SIXTEEN HAVE BEEN CERTIFIED WHICH IS. MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND SHY OF THE REQUIRED. NUMBER AT THAT THE REPORT PREDICTED. THAT'S NOT TO INCLUDE THOSE ARE WHO ARE RETIRING EACH AND EVERY DAY AT THE TIME THE REPORT WAS COMMISSIONED THERE WERE SIXTEEN COURT REPORTING PROGRAMS HERE IN CALIFORNIA SINCE THEN SEVEN OF THEM HAVE CLOSED AND NINE REMAIN. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THERE'S OF THAT THE SCHOOL CLOSURES IS A REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF ENROLLEES A REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER WHO ARE GRADUATING AND OF COURSE THEN THERE A REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER WHO ARE TESTING IT BECOMING CERTIFIED? COURT REPORTERS IN CALIFORNIA. AS OF RIGHT NOW WE FIND NO VIABLE SOLUTION TO REVERSE THE TREND IN STENOGRAPHIC REPORTING TO RECOVER FROM THE LOSSES THAT WE'VE HAD IN THE PAST -- THE CALIFORNIA SHORT HIM REPORTERS BOARD HAS SUGGESTED -- AND JUST RECENTLY -- APPROVED VOICE TECHNOLOGY REPORTERS WHO CONTEST FOR THE CSR EXAM BUT AT THE MOMENT OF THOSE NINE SCHOOLS THAT ARE IN PLACE IN CALIFORNIA NONE OF THEM ARE. SET UP AND IMPLEMENTING VOICE TECHNOLOGY AND A PHONE CALL LAST WEEK. WITH THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE CALIFORNIA SHORTHAND REPORTER SUPPORTIVE ON FENNER SHE SAID THAT THEY WILL SOON BE LOOKING OUT THE REQUIREMENTS THE CURRICULUM REQUIREMENTS FOR VOICE TECHNOLOGY AND THAT IS NOT EXPECTED -- TO TAKE PLACE FOR ANOTHER EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR MONTHS THAT'S HOW LONG THE PROCESS IS EXPECTED TO LAST -- ANOTHER TECHNOLOGY THAT IS -- SAID TO BE AT AN OPTION ON THE TABLE IS REMOTE TECHNOLOGY WHICH BASICALLY MEANS THAT A A REPORTER HERE IN SACRAMENTO COULD COVER A DEPOSITION DOWN IN LOS ANGELES. REMOTELY AND PROVIDED THAT ACCEPTABLE AND IT'S OKAY FOR THE COURT REPORTER NOT TO BE IN THE ROOM WE'RE STILL DEALING WITH A FINITE NUMBER OF COURT REPORTERS. WHO ARE ABLE TO COVER THOSE PROCEEDINGS? DIGITAL REPORTING ANOTHER -- OPTION AS WELL AS VIDEO REPORTING THAT IS INCLUDED IN THIS BILL IS BEING USED NOW TO SUPPLEMENT STENOGRAPHIC COURT REPORTERS THESE DIGITAL REPORTERS ARE TRAINED IN THE EXACT SAME. PROCEDURES PROTOCOL CODE OF ETHICS THAT STENOGRAPHIC REPORTERS ART ARE TRAINED AND THE BOTTOM LINE THE TRANSCRIPT IS WHAT WILL ALWAYS BE A VERBATIM. EXCUSE ME AN ACCURATE VERBATIM RECORD OF RECORD OF THE PROCEEDINGS. MA'AM I DO NEED WRAP UP THE SURE ALL WRAPPED UP IN SORRY OKAY -- AS OF RIGHT NOW TRANSCRIPTION IN. AN IN DEPOSITIONS THAT ARE TAKEN OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA IN STATE THEN YOU'D CASES ARE BEING DONE BY COURT REPORTERS ALL OVER THE UNITED STATES THERE ARE NOT CALIFORNIA CS OURS. THERE IS NO ISSUE WITH ADMISSIBILITY IN COURT LIKEWISE THE FEDERAL THE THE FEDERAL COURTS ARE USING TRANSCRIPTION IS ALL ACROSS THE NATION TO TRANSCRIBE DIGITALLY RECORDED PROCEEDINGS. AND FOR ALL OF THESE REASONS WE OPPOSE A BEFORE TWENTY FOUR I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN A POSITION PLEASE. GET COME THE MICROPHONE. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN MY NAME IS SUSAN IMPERIAL I'M A CALIFORNIA'S CSR OF OVER TWENTY TWO YEARS. I AM ALSO THERE CURRENTLY THE DIRECTOR OF DIGITAL REPORTING FOR STORY CLOUD. THIS BILL FARMS THREE CONSTITUENCIES THE CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA NEEDING LEGAL SERVICES PARTICULARLY LOW INCOME WILL SUFFER ADVERSELY IF THIS BILL PASSES. DIGITAL REPORTING SLASH RECORDING ALLOWS FOR A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN COSTS DUE TO SCALABILITY. THE ECONOMICS OF THE PROPOSED STENOGRAPHIC REQUIREMENT OF TRANSCRIPTION MAKES COST EFFICIENCY IMPOSSIBLE THAT'S PUTTING OUT OF REACH. FAIR AND APPROPRIATE LEGAL REPRESENTATION FOR THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIA LEGAL CONSUMERS. ATTORNEYS FACING OWNERS COSTS OF STENOGRAPHIC TRANSCRIPTIONS SERVICES CANNOT REPRESENT THEIR CLIENTS ADEQUATELY OR OPTIMALLY. CONVERSELY DIGITAL REPORTING SLASH RECORDING DUE TO COST EFFICIENCY. ALLOWS THE ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIA TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE ADVOCATES ON BEHALF OF THEIR CLIENTS. COURT REPORTERS THEMSELVES ARE ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECTED. BY LIMITING REPORTERS TO THE TASK. OF EDITING TRANSCRIPTION WHICH MANY IF NOT MOST COURT REPORTERS CURRENTLY DO NOT OPT TO DO. THEY HAVE A HIGHER SCOPE IS TO DO THAT. YOU ARE NOT ONLY RELEGATING THEM TO THE TASK OF EDITING. BUT YOU HE TO WORK EFFECTIVELY AS REPORTERS. MOREOVER THERE IS AN OVERWHELMING SHORTAGE AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED OF STENOGRAPHIC REPORTERS CURRENTLY IN CALIFORNIA. AS WELL AS NATIONWIDE DUE TO UNTENABLE COMPETENCY THRESHOLDS. AND THE CLOSING OF COURT REPORTING SCHOOLS UP AND DOWN THE STATE. IN ADDITION YOU ARE DENYING QUALIFIED EDITORS AND SCOPE IS THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO WHAT THEY DO BEST PREPARE QUALITY TRANSCRIPTS. YOU WOULD BE PUTTING OUT OF BUSINESS THOUSANDS OF QUALIFIED CALIFORNIA'S SCOPUS WHAT WORSENING THE ALREADY ADVERSE STATUS OF THE CURRENT STENOGRAPHIC COURT REPORTING LABOR MARKET. BOTTOM LINE THIS BILL WILL GREATLY DIMINISH THE NUMBER OF TRANSCRIPTION JOBS IN CALIFORNIA WITHOUT PROVIDING [inaudible] ADEQUATE. WOMAN AND MAN POWER. TO DO THE JOB OF EDITING TRANSCRIPTION. AND IT WILL ADVERSELY HARM THE CITIZENS ATTORNEYS REPORTERS AND SCOPAS OF CALIFORNIA. THIS BILL THROWS THE CALIFORNIA COURT REPORTING INDUSTRY INTO CHAOS. AND IT DOES NOT COOL THE FIRE IT FUELS THE FIRE. THANK YOU THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. RIGHT SEE NONE OF BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMON. ALL RIGHTS -- SEEING NONE OF US TO GABRIEL I A THANK YOU I KNOW WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS ISSUE AND TRYING TO ESTABLISH THE LEVEL QUALITY FOR COURT REPORTERS AND STENOGRAPHERS WHICH I THINK IS CRITICAL. FROM MY STANDPOINT YOUR BILL ABSOLUTELY PASSES MUSTER FOR THIS COMMITTEE I APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THIS FORWARD. AND SHOULD LIKE YOU CAN CLOSE I APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH AND ALL YOUR WORK MISTER CHAIRMAN RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU ONCE WE GET A QUORUM WE WILL DO THAT IN A SECOND.

THAT ARE INCLUSIVE OF THE YOUTH EXPERIENCING EASILY ACCESSIBLE -- TO EMPOWER THEIR DECISION MAKING THE FOSTER YOU HAVE THE OLD HAVE TO OVERCOME INSURMOUNTABLE ODDS AND HAVE A HIGH RATE OF UNEMPLOYMENT. AND INCARCERATION THESE YOU TURN TO THAT CAN HELP THEM UNDERSTAND THE RESOURCES AND THE RIGHTS ENTITLED TO THEM UNDER THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. HELLO BACKGROUND IN TWO THOUSAND AND ONE SENATOR -- SENATE BILL EIGHT NINE NINE BY LOU ECSTATIC TO FALL FOR YOU THE BILL OF RIGHTS. AND REQUIRED THE SOCIAL WORKER TO NOTIFY FOSTER YOU -- UP THERE IN A LITTLE RIGHTS IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN I AUTHORS SIMPLY BUILT TEN SIXTY SEVEN WHICH WAS FIVE BY THE END GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES TO CONVENE A WORK GROUP. TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS AN UPDATE PROVISIONS TO THE FOSTER YOUTH BILL OF RIGHTS. ASSEMBLY BILL ONE SEVENTY FIVE IS BEFORE YOU TODAY AT SPECIFICALLY THE RIGHTS TO RECEIVE GROOMING. HI GENE PRODUCTS. REGARDLESS OF SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND GENDER IDENTIFICATION. TO BE REFERRED TO REFERRED -- TO BY THEIR PREFERRED NAME OR PRONOUN. DO YOU HAVE REASONABLE ACCESS TO COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY. AND THE INTERNET AMONG OTHERS. WITH ME TO HEAR TO PROVIDE SUPPORTING TESTIMONY -- FOR ASSEMBLY BILL ONE SEVENTY FIVE IS REVEREND LINDA DO HER SOON THAT'S THEIR RIGHT PRETTY GOOD OKAY -- OF THE TABLE. AT THIS CHURCH A FOSTER PARENT AND THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM CALIFORNIA YOU CONNECTION IN SUPPORT OF AB. ONE SEVENTY FIVE THANK YOU FIRST WITH US PLEASE. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND YET YOU SPEAK IN THE MICROPHONE THAT THAT BECOME NERVOUS. I CAN GET A BREEZE. GREAT. OKAY THERE YOU GO -- MY NAME IS LINDA DO HERE'S TO AS HE SAID AND I'M A CO PASTOR OF A UNITED METHODIST CHURCH IN SACRAMENTO WE CALL OURSELVES THE TABLE. AND IN OUR CHURCH IN SAC ARE MANY FOSTER PARENTS AND FOSTER CHILDREN -- FOSTER PROFESSIONALS IN THE SYSTEM. I MYSELF AM ACTUALLY AN ADOPTIVE MOM NOT A FOSTER MOM -- MY FAMILY AS PART OF AN OPEN ADOPTION -- AND WE ARE IN COMMUNITY WITH OUR SON'S BIRTH MOM WHO HERSELF WAS A PART OF THE CALIFORNIA FOSTER SYSTEM. AND OURS SON IN OUR FAMILY ARE A PART OF AN OPEN ADOPTION WITH HIS BIRTH SIBLINGS. SOME TIME AGO I SERVED ON A CONTINUUM OF CARE TEAM IN NAPA COUNTY WHERE WE THEN LEFT WHICH SUPPORTED FOSTER FAMILIES WHO FOSTER TEENAGERS TO FIND WAYS. TO COMMUNICATE AND BUILD TRUST HIM VERY DIFFICULT AND CHALLENGING CIRCUMSTANCES -- SO I KNOW THAT FOSTER TO TING THE TRAUMA OF SEPARATION FROM THEIR BIRTH FAMILIES FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS. AND AS A UNITED METHODIST PASTOR I BELIEVE ALL CHILDREN SHOULD BE TREATED WITH RESPECT AND DIGNITY REGARDLESS OF THEIR RACE OR SEXUAL ORIENTATION. GENDER IDENTITY OR THEIR RELIGION. IN ORDER FOR THE WORK OF OUR CALIFORNIA FOSTER CARE SYSTEM TO BE SUCCESSFUL I BELIEVE WE NEED AN INTERSECTIONAL APPROACH WHICH RECOGNIZES THAT. BARRIERS -- DEBERRY YEARS THAT ARMED PEOPLE EXPERIENCE AROUND RACE SEXUAL ORIENTATION GENDER IDENTITY AND RELIGION THAT CREATE CHALLENGES FOR OUR PROFESSIONAL WORKERS AND TO THOSE WHO SEEK. TO BE FOSTER PARENTS. SO AS A PASTOR SUPPORTING A LOT OF FOSTER PARENTS AND CHILDREN I BELIEVE IT IS IT -- OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO SUPPORT THEM AT ESPECIALLY THE FOSTER PARENTS TO PROVIDE THE BEST LOVING AND STABLE ENVIRONMENT -- FOR THEIR FOSTER CHILD. REGARDLESS OF WHO THE CHILD IDENTIFIES AS OR WHAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO BE CALLED I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT THE WORK TOWARD FULL INCLUSION FOR FOSTER YOUTH IS VARIED. AND VERY COMPLEX IS SO I AM. DEEPLY IN SUPPORT OF AB ONE SEVENTY FIVE WHICH SEEKS TO MODERNIZE THIS FOSTER YOUTH BILL OF RIGHTS WHICH IS A WONDERFUL THING -- SO THAT IT ADDRESSES CURRENT KLAY TO RECEIVE GROOMING AND HYGIENE PRODUCTS REGARDLESS OF SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND GENDER IDENTITY AND I DON'T MEAN THIS AS A JOKE BUT ALL TEENAGERS NEED GROOMING AND HYGIENE PRODUCTS I HAVE THREE TEENAGERS -- GOODNESS. TO ATTEND CULTURAL ACTIVITIES CONSISTENT WITH OUR IDENTITY. AND TO BE REFERRED TO BY THEIR PREFERRED NAMES AND THEIR GENDER PRONOUNS AND I SAY THIS RESPECTFULLY -- AND WITH PASSION THANK YOU THANK YOU. NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. GOOD MORNING MY NAME SERVE AS A HERNANDEZ I'M THE DIRECTOR POLICY FOR CALIFORNIA'S CONNECTION. SEE WE SEE THE EUCLID ORGANIZATION OF CAR AND FORMER FOSTER YOUTH ACROSS THE STATE. MANY OF YOU HAVE MAYBE MY OUR MEMBERS THROUGH SATURDAY OR ARE ADVOCACY DAY AND WHAT'S UNIQUE ABOUT SEE WE SEE IS THAT WE PUT OUR YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT OF OUR POLICY PLATFORM. A THE FIRST YOUTH BILL OF RIGHTS SPECIFICALLY CAN BE CONSIDERED ONE OF COS HE'S LEGACY PROJECTS WE WERE THERE IN TWO THOUSAND ONE WHEN IT WAS ORIGINATED -- ANOTHER BILL WE RAN WAS TO CREATE THE FALSE KAREN BUT OFFICE AND AGAIN IN PARTNERSHIP. WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER GIPSON WHEN WE UPDATED IT TWO YEARS AGO. MY DO THIS HAS BEEN SEVERAL GENERATIONS OF CIC MEMBERS WHO HAVE ADVOCATED FOR THIS BILL OF RIGHTS TO REFLECT WHAT RIGHTS AND MANDATES ARE THERE TO PROTECT THEM. IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. SPECIFICALLY THE ORIGINS OF THE FALLS TO THE BILL OF RIGHTS WERE REALLY DESIGNED TO SUPPORT -- OUR YOUNG PEOPLE AND CONGREGATE CARE AS WE KNOW WHAT THE MAJOR C. C. R. REFORM THERE'S A BIG PUSH FOR HOME BE SETTINGS -- BUT WE CAN WE MUST LOOK AT THE SYSTEM HOLISTICALLY WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT POLICY SHIPS. MY MEMBERS ARE EXCITED ABOUT THE UPDATE UPDATED FALLS TO THE BILL OF RIGHTS AS THEY HAVE FULLY PARTICIPATED IN THE TWO YEAR STAKEHOLDER PROCESS. LED BY THE FOSTER CARE -- BUT OFFICE. AND MY MEMBERS ARE CLEAR WHEN THEY SAY THAT THEY DESERVE TO KNOW THEIR RIGHTS -- IN A WAY THAT MAKES SENSE TO THEM AND THAT IS AGE APPROPRIATE. THEY ALSO SHARE THAT GROWING UP IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM THERE IS A LOT OF LOSS THERE'S GRIEF BUT THERE'S ALSO POWER WHEN THEY LEARN HOW TO NAVIGATE THE SYSTEM BECOME. AN ADULT THE COW YOUTH STUDY STATES THAT 80% BETWEEN 8290% OF YOUNG PEOPLE WANT TO GO TO COLLEGE AND GO ON TO LIVE HAPPY HEALTHY LIVES. THIS IS HOW I EXPERIENCE MY MEMBERS THEY ALSO SHARE THAT HAVING A SUPPORT NETWORK EVEN BETTER A FAMILY AS THE BEST WAY TO SUPPORT THEM. IN THAT QUALITY FOSTER PARENTS WHO ARE UNDER THERE AND RESPECT THEIR FULL IDENTITY IS ONE OF THE BEST -- INTERVENTIONS THAT THE SYSTEM CAN PROVIDE WITH THIS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY. THANK YOU THIS GIPSON DO YOU HAVE OTHER WITNESSES WORK NO OKAY OTHERS IN SUPPORT. IF YOU JUST GIVE US YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION. HEY I LET'S GET THE MICROPHONE TURNED ON GOOD MORNING MR TURN MEMBERS CONNIE DELGADO FOR THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION SUPPORT. THANK YOU. BECCA KRAMER MATTER ON BEHALF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA ALSO INSTANCE SUPPORT. HELEN ROWLAND MEMBER OF THE DAVIS UNITED METHODIST CHURCH SUPPORT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN BURSTING HEARST HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS AND SUPPORT. N. MATTHEW SMITH -- UNITED METHODIST PASTOR IN SUPPORT. RENDON AWESOME PASSED TO THE DAVIS UNITED METHODIST CHURCH IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. ALRIGHT SING NONE OPPOSITION. IF YOU COULD YOU CLEAR THE TABLES PLEASE FOR THE FOLKS TO COME UP. THANKS [inaudible] THE TEXT MORNING THE MORNING ARE YOU. THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS -- MY NAME'S GREG BIRDS AND I WORK FOR THE CALIFORNIA FAMILY COUNCIL. ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SEVERAL REASONS OUR ORGANIZATION IS OPPOSING AB ONE SEVEN FIVE I'M GONNA FOCUS ON THE PROVISION. THAT GIVES FOSTER KIDS THE RIGHT TO DEMAND THAT OTHERS USE THEIR PRONOUN A PREFERENCE. THE FIRST ISSUE IS OF MORALITY. IT IS WRONG TO TEACH FOSTER KIDS THAT THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO FORCE OTHER PERSONS TO SAY WORDS THAT THAT PERSON DOESN'T BELIEVE. IN ANY OTHER CONTEXT THIS WOULD BE UNTHINKABLE. WHEN A CHILD OR EVEN ADULT TRIES TO MAKE ANOTHER PERSON SAY SOMETHING THAT CONTRADICTS THAT PERSON'S BELIEF SYSTEM? IT'S RUDE AND OBNOXIOUS. BUT WHEN THE GOVERNMENT GETS INVOLVED AND TRIES TO MANDATE THE WORDS THAT COME OUT OF A PERSON'S MOUTH. IT'S TO RAN A COAL. THE FIRST AMENDMENT DOES NOT NOT ONLY PROTECTS OUR FREEDOM TO SPEAK WORDS THE GOVERNMENT DOESN'T LIKE. BUT THE PROHIBITS THE GOVERNMENT FROM COMPELLING US TO SAY WORDS OR PROMOTE IDEAS WE DON'T BELIEVE. THIS COMMITTEE LEARNED THAT THE HARD WAY LAST YEAR WHEN THE US SUPREME COURT INVALIDATED ONE OF ITS LAWS THIS COMMITTEE APPROVED SEVERAL YEARS AGO. HERE IS WHAT JUSTICE ANTHONY KENNEDY SAID WHEN HE AND FOUR OTHER JUSTICES STRUCK DOWN THE REPRODUCTIVE FACT ACT. AS UNCONSTITUTIONAL. AND I QUOTE. GOVERNMENTS MUST NOT BE ALLOWED TO FORCE PERSONS TO EXPRESS THE MESSAGE CONTRARY TO THEIR DEEPEST CONVICTIONS. FREEDOM OF SPEECH SECURES FREEDOM OF THOUGHT AND BELIEF. THIS LAW IN PERIL OF THOSE LIBERTIES CLOSE QUOTE. NO ONE WANTS TO BE FORCED TO SAY WHAT THEY DO NOT BELIEVE. WHEN YOU FORCE TRANSGENDER PRO SOMEONE WHO BELIEVES THAT GENDER IS BINARY? AND DETERMINED BY BIOLOGY YOU ARE COMPELLING SPEECH. IT'S COMMON KNOWLEDGE THE CALIFORNIA DOES NOT HAVE ENOUGH FOSTER FAMILIES FOR THOSE CHILDREN NEEDING THEM. DURING THE LAST HEARING ASSEMBLYMAN GIBSON ARGUE THAT HIS BILL HAS AND I QUOTE GREAT POTENTIAL OF INCREASING PARENTS TAKING IN FOSTER CHILDREN REALLY. COMMON SAYS SINCE WITH SAY THAT THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE. RULES LIKE THIS MAKE FOSTER PARENTS THINK TWICE ABOUT TAKING ON THE RESPONSIBILITY OF FOSTERING. AND THIS IS NOT FEAR MONGERING. PEOPLE OF FAITH WANT TO LOVE AND CARE FOR FOSTER CHILDREN AND THIS BILL SENDS THE MESSAGE THAT THEIR HELP IS NOT WANTED. SO WE ASK THAT YOU PLEASE OPPOSE AND VOTE NO ON AB ONE SEVEN FIVE THINK SO MUCH. THANK YOU BEFORE WE GO TO THE NEXT WITNESS I'D LIKE TO STARVATION FORM PLEASE STONE HERE [inaudible] GALLAGHER. CHAO YEAH CHIU. GONZALEZ HOLDEN KALRA KILEY MAIENSCHEIN [inaudible] OBERNOLTE [inaudible] PETRIE-NORRIS REYES. THANK YOU N. AS I'D ALSO LIKE. TO WELCOME OUR NEW VICE CHAIR MR GALLAGHER AND MR OVER OBERNOLTE WHO'S A NEW MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE THIS IS OUR FIRST. REGULAR HEARING AND A WE HAD ONE OFF THE FLOOR EARLIER BUT WELCOME TO THE NEW MEMBERS AND A APPRECIATE EVERYONE BEING HERE I WOULD ALSO SINCE WE HAVE THIS HOUSE FOR LIKE TO KNOW THAT ITEM NUMBER FOUR A. B.. THREE TEN SANTIAGO HAS BEEN PULLED FROM OUR AGENDA TODAY. ALL RIGHT WE WILL CONTINUE WITH HEARING ON THIS ITEM NEXT WITNESS PLEASE -- MISTER CHAIRMAN MISTER VICE CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE GOOD MORNING MY NAME'S KEVIN SNYDER A WITH PACIFIC JUSTICE NSTITUTE CENTER FOR PUBLIC POLICY OR I SERVICE CHIEF COUNSEL. THE BILL BEFORE YOU GIVES TEENS UNFETTERED. IN AN UNFETTERED RIGHT TO ATTEND RELIGIOUS AND CULTURAL SERVICES AND ACTIVITIES. OF THEIR CHOICE. SO IF A A YOUNG PERSON -- TELLS A FOSTER PARENT. I DON'T WANT TO GO TO YOUTH GROUP -- AND NOTICE ONUS HE'S BEEN RADICALIZED THROUGH THE HIS THROUGH THE INTERNET WHICH IS A NEW RIGHT. ANY SAYS INSTEAD -- DROP ME OFF AT THE NORDIC TEMPLE SO I COULD BE WITH PEOPLE OF LIKE FAITH IN LIKE RACE. THE BILL THIS BILL REQUIRES FOSTER PARENTS TO LISTEN AND OBEY THEIR TEAM. THIS. CAN BE RESOLVED AS DESCRIBED IN THE LETTER THAT I SUBMITTED TO THE COMMITTEE THROUGH AMENDMENT. BUT THE BILL THEN TAKES A CONSTITUTIONALLY PERILOUS TURN BY WEAPONIZE IN AN ADOLESCENT WITH THE FORCE OF LAW. TO COMPEL UNWILLING ADULT THIRD PARTIES TO REFER TO THIS TEENAGER BY WHATEVER NAME OR PRONOUN THAT THEY DESIRE. FOR EXAMPLE A TEENAGE BOY COULD DIRECT A FOSTER PARENT TO USE THE PRONOUN THEY INSTEAD OF HE THIS IS CONTENT BASED SPEECH. THIS IS COMPELLED SPEECH. JUST THIS LAST YEAR THE US SUPREME COURT IN THE JANICE DECISION MADE IT CLEAR THAT THE GOVERNMENT CANNOT COMPEL INDIVIDUALS TO MOUSE SUPPORT FOR VIEWS THEY FIND [inaudible] OBJECTIONABLE. IF YOUR RELIGIOUS CONVICTIONS SCIENCE OR THE LOGIC OF GRAMMAR LEAD YOU TO BELIEVE THAT A MALE IS THAT HE OR ONE PERSON IS NOT THE A THE GOVERNMENT CANNOT FORCE YOU. TO SAY SOMETHING YOU KNOW TO BE DEMONSTRABLY FALSE. IT IS AS ORWELLIAN IS FORCING SOMEONE TO SAY TWO PLUS TWO EQUALS. FIVE SACRAMENTO NATIVE JUSTICE KENNEDY. A WROTE PERHAPS THE LAST OPINION THAT CAME FROM HIS PAN LAST YEAR -- ON THE REPRODUCTIVE FACT DECK. IT WAS JUST QUOTED AND I'LL QUOTED AGAIN FOR YOUR BENEFIT GOVERNMENTS MUST NOT BE ALLOWED TO FORCE PERSONS TO EXPRESS A MESSAGE CONTRARY. TO THEIR DEEPEST CONVICTIONS THAT WAS. A OPINION IN A CONCURRENCE WHICH I WOULD DIRECT YOU TO READ. I WON'T ASK FOR SHOW OF HANDS BUT SEVERAL OF YOU VOTED FOR THE REPRODUCTIVE FACT ACT AND YOU WERE WARNED THAT THAT WAS UNCONSTITUTIONAL. AND SO I WOULD SUGGEST THAT YOU READ THAT OPINION. YOUNG PEOPLE DO NOT NEED A BIG BROTHER TO WRITE A LONG LIST OF HOUSE PRIVILEGES THEY NEED PARENTS WHO CAN PARENTS. THEM THROUGH THE TURBULENCE OF BEING A TEENAGER MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MISTER VICE CHAIRMAN I THANK YOU FOR YOUR DELIBERATION ON THIS MATTER FOR YOUR SERVICE TO THE COMMUNITY. AND I URGE THE MEMBERS TO VOTE NAY. SECOND MOTION AND A SECONDS. OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. IF YOU BECOME THE MICROPHONE GIVE US YOUR NAME AND AFFILIATION PLEASE. ALL RIGHT SIGNALED A BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS. SIR OBERNOLTE AND THE MISTER KALRA. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF MISTER GIBSON. A QUESTION ABOUT THE PART OF THE BILL THAT. GIVES FOSTER YOUTH THE RIGHT TO BE PLACED IN THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE SETTING POSSIBLE. AND THERE'S NO DEFINITION OR ELABORATION ON WHAT THAT MEANS COULD YOU COULD YOU TELL US WHAT YOUR INTENT WAS WITH THAT SECTION BECAUSE I HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT IT. GO AHEAD AND JUMP IN I'M PLEASE RESPECT AT LEAST RESTRICTIVE STUDYING IS -- ALLUDING TO CONGREGATE HOMES IN INSTITUTIONS WHERE WE HAVE FOUND THAT FOSTER YOUTH HAVE BEEN IN THE HOUSE. IN THE PAST WITH NO JUSTIFICATION AND SO WHAT THE CONTINUE OF CARE REFORM LEAST RESTRICTIVE MEANS HOME BASED WITH AL -- CURFEWS WITHOUT RULES AND REGULATIONS THAT PROHIBIT THEIR NORMAL LIVES AND SO WE FIND THIS MOST IN GROUP HOMES SETTINGS THIRTEEN AND FOURTEEN AN INSTITUTIONAL -- INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE RESTRICTED THEIR THEIR NORMAL ACTIVITIES SO IT'S A SYNONYM FOR A HOME BASED PLACEMENT. OKAY. I APPRECIATE THE CLARIFICATION I WISH THEY BECAUSE I'M GONNA HAVE TO BE IN RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO THE BILL AND IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE LANGUAGE ABOUT GENDER ORIENTATION IN THE BILL. AND MORE TO DO WITH MY CONCERNS THAT. IF GOD FORBID MY CHILDREN WHEREVER HE PLACED IN FOSTER CARE I WOULD WANT THE FOSTER PARENTS TO BE PARENTS. CAN BEING A PARENT SOMETIMES REQUIRES PLACING RESTRICTIONS ON CHILDREN BECAUSE THEIR CHILDREN AND THEY NEED TO BE GUIDED. AND THE LANGUAGE IN THIS BILL ABOUT. THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE SETTING AND THE LANGUAGE IN THIS BILL ABOUT -- NOT HAVING GIVING FOSTER PARENTS THE RIGHT TO TAKE AWAY ACCESS TO ACTIVITIES. MAKES ME BELIEVE THAT IT A ROADS THE FOSTER PARENTS ABILITY TO PARENTS -- BUT I THANK YOU FOR THE ANSWER THE QUESTION. AND IF I MAY STEP IN -- THAT IS A PRETTY WELL ESTABLISHED TERM IN. THROUGH THAT PROCESS BOTH FEDERAL LAW AND STATE LAW AND RULES AND REGULATIONS IN FACT ALL THIS BILL REALLY DOES. ISN'T CAPULET CAPS LATE EXISTING LAW. EXISTING REGULATIONS AND PRACTICES AT DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES SO THE TERMS THAT ARE USED IN HERE ARE IN THIS REALM PRETTY WELL DEFINED IN PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD. I'LL HAVE TO RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH YOU MISTER CHAIR THE WASN'T CLEAR TO ME ON A PLAIN LANGUAGE READING OF THE BILL THAT THAT'S WHAT LEAST RESTRICTIVE SETTING THAT. OKAY IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE ANALYSIS I THINK IT'S FAIRLY CLEAR AND IF YOU LIKE I CAN GET YOU MORE RESOURCES ON THE THE THE LAW WITH HER OUR SYSTEM. WHERE THIS IS VERY HEAVILY CODIFIED? I THINK OF USEFUL THANK YOU SURE A MISTER KALRA. THANK THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK SUMMER GIPSON -- I I KNOW WAS WORK ON FOSTER YOUTH ISSUES THE ENTIRE TIME HE'S BEEN IN THE LEGISLATURE AND ALL THIS IS A CONTINUE TO A PART OF THAT WORK -- TO ENSURE THAT WERE SUPPORTING OUR FOSTER YOUTH WHO WILL BE ALL KNOW HAVE -- MANY CHALLENGES AND I BELIEVE DESERVE -- SUPPORTIVE -- ENVIRONMENTS THAT -- VALIDATE WHO THEY ARE -- AND YOU KNOW. I I REALLY APPRECIATE THE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. OF FOR THEIR FOR THEIR TESTIMONY AND YOU KNOW IF SOMEONE CANNOT. SUPPORT UP ANY YOUTH AND AND I THINK THAT -- I APPRECIATE -- BUT THE THE WORK THAT LEGISLATORS DONE PEOPLE PRIOR TO MEET MY COME HERE BUT EVEN THE LAST COUPLE YEARS. IN RECOGNIZING THE THE CHALLENGES OF BEING OF AUSTRIA. AND OFTENTIMES PARTICULARLY -- LGBT Q. -- YOUTH ARE THE ONES THAT HAVE -- DIFFICULTY -- IN FOSTER PLACEMENTS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT ACCEPTED WITH A ARE AND HAVE A MUCH GREATER LIKELIHOOD OF OF ENDING UP HOMELESS -- ANY UP IN THE PROMOTE JUSTICE SYSTEM AND THE A BEING VICTIMS AND WITHIN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AS WELL AND SO I THINK THAT IT DOES REQUIRE US TO TAKE -- EXTRA STEPS TO ENSURE THEIR SAFETY AND ENSURE THAT WERE SUPPORTING GIVE THEM ONCE AGAIN FOR WHO THEY ARE AND I WANT TO THANK A ASSEMBLY GIPSON COMING THIS BEFORE THANK YOU THANK YOU [inaudible] THE STAFF. I JUST HAVE A QUICK QUESTION ON THE ENFORCEMENT COMPONENT SO WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF OF PUBLIC SERVICES -- BE THE AND FORCING AGENCY IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE OR ALL OF THE CASES YES [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] THIS GALLAGHER. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN -- SO. ASSUMING GIPSON A NOTE WE SHARE A PASSION FOR FOSTER USE AND AND CERTAINLY IN TRYING TO ENSURE THAT -- YOU KNOW WE PROVIDE. A GOOD EXPERIENCE FOR FOSTER USE THAT -- THAT WE KNOW THERE HAS BEEN PROBLEMS -- IN THE PAST -- ABUSES -- I GUESS ONE OF MY CAN SELL START UNUSUALLY MY CONCERN IS I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN IN CLOSE CONTACT WITH THE GROUP. OF THE STAKEHOLDER GROUP IN THAT PROCESS BUT NONE THE LESS THE PROCESS IS NOT DONE YET IT'S NOT COMPLETED. AND I THINK IT BE KINDA BE PUTTING THE CART BEFORE THE HORSE BEFORE WE HAD THAT FULL REPORT BACK. AS TO YOU KNOW WHAT WE SHOULD DO IN TERMS OF UPDATING THE FOSTER CARE BILL OF RIGHTS -- I ALSO THINK IS HAS BEEN AS IT'S BEEN POINTED OUT AND I DON'T SEE ANY REASON WHY WE COULDN'T. PUT THE SOFT ON NEXT YEAR ONCE WE HAVE THE REPORT IN FRONT OF US AND WE CAN EVERYBODY CAN GO THROUGH THAT -- BUT I ALSO THINK IT'S BEEN POINTED OUT SOME OF THESE THINGS -- YOU KNOW COULD BE INTERPRETED AWAY THE INTERFERES WITH THE ABILITY OF A FOSTER PARENT. TO BE A PARENT. WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT WE WANT -- WE DO WANT ARE FOSTER PARENTS TO YOU KNOW [inaudible] BY A A GOOD PLACE -- FOR FOR A FOSTER USE -- BUT PART OF THAT IS IS IS. IS BEING ABLE TO PARENT THE WAY THAT YOU. SEE FIT FOR THAT CHILD -- WHICH COULD INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON YOU KNOW TIME USING THE INTERNET. WHICH COULD INCLUDE I MEAN NOT EVERYONE HAS TO GIVE AN ALLOWANCE. HE I MEAN CERTAIN SAYING THESE THINGS ARE RIGHT -- WHEN YOU KNOW THERE'S? HERE'S DEFINITELY THINGS THAT COULD BE A REASONABLE USE OF A PARENT UTILIZING THEIR AUTHORITY IN TRYING TO ESTABLISH BOUNDARIES AND TRYING -- TO YOU PROVIDE THAT STRUCK -- THAT I THINK ALL OF US. THOSE OF US WHO WHO ARE HERE AS PARENTS. DO OURSELVES YOU KNOW AND SO. WHY WOULD WE KIND OF EXPECT SOMETHING DIFFERENT? FOR FOSTER PARENTS AND WE WOULD EXPECT -- THEN WE WOULD EXPECT OF OURSELVES AS PARENTS. PARENTING OUR OWN CHILDREN -- SO I THINK WE NEED TO REALLY THINK ABOUT THAT BEFORE WE JUST ESTABLISHED THIS IS SOME SORT OF RIGHT -- AND I THINK WITH WITH WITH REGARD TO THE GENDER IDENTITY ISSUE I KNOW THAT'S OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING IS VERY SENSITIVE. TO A LOT OF PEOPLE -- BUT THERE ARE CASES WHERE YOU KNOW WHERE THERE'S GENDER DYSPHORIA AND AND THAT ACTUALLY -- THE CHILD ENDS UP GOING BY THEIR BIOLOGICAL SEX BY THE TIME THEY REACH ADULTHOOD -- AND SO. AND THERE MAY BE ISSUES WE KNOW THAT FOSTER USE DEAL WITH A LOT OF ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES AS WE KNOW ACES -- THERE COULD BE A YOU KNOW OTHER THINGS GOING ON THAT IS PART OF A COUNSELING -- REGIMEN AS PART OF SUPPORTING THAT USE IN GETTING THROUGH THIS THEY MAY HANDLE THAT DIFFERENTLY THAN. SAY THE PEOPLE ON THIS COMMITTEE. THANK YOU SHOULD HANDLE THAT. AND YOU KNOW I DON'T REALLY THINK THAT THAT'S OUR PLACE TO DETERMINE. YOU KNOW YOU KNOW WHAT NAMES YOU SHOULD USE. YOU HOW YOU SHOULD DEAL WITH THAT SITUATION AND A AND IT I THINK IT IS VERY SPECIFIC TO THE CHILD THAT'S INVOLVES NOT EVERY CHILD IS THE SAME WE ALL KNOW THAT WE ALL SAY THAT -- BUT WE SEEM TO HAVE A PROBLEM. DOING THAT IN PRACTICE WHEN WE'RE WHEN WE'RE PASSING LAW -- SO YOU KNOW I JUST THINK THAT AT THIS TIME APPOINTED TIME WITH WHERE THIS BILLS THAT IT'S PREMATURE AND I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT NEED TO BE WORKED THROUGH -- THAT COULD ACTUALLY IMPEDE. THE ABILITY OF OF FOSTER PARENTS TO PROVIDE THAT. THAT SAVE SPACE THAT STRUCTURED SPACE THAT PLACE IS GOING TO BRING THIS CHILD TO ADULTHOOD. AND INTO A PRODUCTIVE LIFESTYLE LONG TERM -- AND SO I KNOW WE DON'T WANT TO DO THAT. AND THAT'S WHY I WOULD JUST SAY HEY I THINK THIS ME SOME MORE TIME NEED SOME MORE DISCUSSION. AND I YOU KNOW CAN'T BE SUPPORTER OF IT IN ITS CURRENT FORM. HI THANK YOU MISTER GIBSON FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I WOULD POINT OUT TO THE COMMITTEE THAT IF YOU LOOK AT THE ANALYSIS EVERYONE OF THE RIGHTS THAT'S LISTED. HAS A STATUTORY OR REGULATORY REFERENCE ASSOCIATED WITH THAT THERE IS NOTHING IN THIS BILL THAT ESTABLISHES ANY NEW RIGHTS. OR OBLIGATIONS THEY ARE ENTIRELY EXISTING IN CALIFORNIA LAW THE VALUE OF THIS STATEMENT. AND WHY A THERE'S NOT A QUESTION OF CONSTITUTIONALITY WHERE THERE'S NOT A QUESTION THAT WERE IMPOSING ANYTHING. IS THAT IT IS A VERY. CLEAR SO FOR FOSTER KIDS TO BE ABLE TO SEE WHERE THEIR RIGHTS ARE ENUMERATED BECAUSE THEY ALREADY EXIST IN STATUTE EXISTED REGULATION. THERE'S NOTHING NEW IN HERE SO I DON'T SEE ANY REASON WHY THEY SHOULD MOVE FORWARD I DON'T SEE WHY. WE NEED TO WAIT FOR ANYTHING IN ADDITION I THINK YOU'VE DONE A VERY GOOD JOB WITH THIS MISTER GIBSON THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND ALL RIGHT MISTER GALLAGHER. I MEAN IF IF I MIGHT -- YOU KNOW WE HAVE SOME GREAT PEOPLE UP HERE WHO DO ANALYSES AND AND AND MY GIVE THEM A LOT OF CREDIT FOR WHAT THEY PUT TOGETHER BUT AN ANALYSIS OF THE COMMITTEE IS NOT LIKE THE END ALL BE ALL. AND HEY THAT'S THE FINAL ANSWER -- NO AND AND I GUESS THE OTHER PART WOULD BE. YOU KNOW. YOU KNOW IF THIS IS TRUE THAT IS ALL STATUTORY REGULATORY THAN THAT WOULD NEGATE THE NEED FOR THE BILL. BECAUSE OF ITS ALREADY IF IT'S ALREADY ESTABLISHED LAW WHY ARE WE DOING ANOTHER LAW. TO JUST REPEAT THAT I SUSPECT THAT THAT'S ACTUALLY NOT THE CASE AND THAT'S WHY I'M MANY OF THE CONCERNS BEEN REYES AGAIN IF YOU LOOK AT THE ANALYSIS AND I'M NOT SAYING THE ANALYSIS IS IS WHAT ESTABLISHES THAT. BUT IF YOU LOOK AT EACH OF THE PROVISIONS. THAT ARE LAID OUT IN IT IS KEYED TO EXISTING STATUTES OR SIZE YOU WOULD NEED TO GO READ THE STATUTES AND EACH REGULATORY REFERENCE TO UNDERSTAND WHERE ALL OF THE PROVISIONS ARE. AND GIVEN THAT THERE IS A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING EVEN HERE OF THE CONNECTIVITY TO THE STATUTORY FRAMEWORK INTO THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK THINK HOW. DIFFICULT THAT IS FOR A FOSTER CHILD TO NAVIGATE. THE VALUE OF THIS BILL THE VALUE OF THIS STATEMENT OF FOSTER CHILD'S BILL OF RIGHTS IS SO THAT IS CLEARLY PUT IN ONE PLACE. FOR REFERENCE THIS IS A DOCUMENT THAT WOULD BE PROVIDED. TO FOSTER CHILDREN WHO ARE IN THE CARE OF THE STATE. SO THAT THEY AT LEAST HAVE A CLEAR STATEMENT THAT OF WHAT THEIR RIGHTS ARE THEY CAN PURSUE THAT. IF OTHERWISE NECESSARY BUT THERE'S NOTHING REALLY IN HERE THAT'S NOT ALWAYS ALREADY WELL ESTABLISHED MR. TO THANK YOU. I WASN'T GOING TO SPEAK ON THIS BUT FIRST WELL GLAD TO HAVE MISTER GALLAGHER BACK IN THE COMMITTEE -- AND I WOULD LIKE -- TO TO SAY A FEW THOUGHTS ON THIS. VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT THE AUTHOR IS ADDRESSING THE REALITY -- THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CHILDREN WHO OPPORTUNITY TO BE WHO THEY ARE -- I DISCUSS THIS BILL WITH MY WIFE LAST NIGHT SHE MANAGES A FOSTER CARE PROGRAM AND SHE WILL TELL YOU. AND THE COMMUNITY OF FOLKS WHO WORK WITH FOSTER CARE CARE CHILDREN WILL TELL YOU JUST HOW MUCH INCREDIBLE HURT THERE HAS ALREADY BEEN -- BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT CHILDREN CONTINUE TO BE DENIED THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE WHO THEY ARE AND THE SUGGESTION THAT WE SHOULD NOT ADDRESS THAT AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN -- IT IS ONE THAT I SIMPLY DISAGREE WITH I ALSO WANNA JUST TAKE THE MOMENT I KNOW THERE WERE SOME REFERENCE TO SUGGEST THAT THE SUPREME COURT. HAS WAITED ON THIS IS AND I THINK ARE THE OPPONENTS OF THIS BILL WOULD KNOW THAT BILL WAS IN A VERY DIFFERENT CONTEXT I DON'T THINK ONE COULD SAY -- THAT THE CONTEXT OF THE NEW FLU DECISION HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE SUBJECT THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY. AND I WOULD ALSO SAY -- RESPECTING THE PERSPECTIVE THAT IS BROUGHT BY THE OPPONENTS I KNOW -- IT COMES FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE OF WHAT IT MEANS TO BE CHRISTIAN I WOULD JUST SAY AS A CHURCH GOING CHRISTIAN [inaudible] MYSELF. THE GREATEST COMMANDMENT THAT WE HAVE IS TO LOVE AND I THINK FUNDAMENTALLY THIS BILL IS ABOUT. IS ABOUT SAYING THAT WE RESPECT AND LOVE CHILDREN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM AND WE WANT THEM. TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE WHO THEY WANT WITH THAT. HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS BILL AND I'M ALSO HAPPY TO BE ADDED ON AS A CO AUTHOR OF THAT SOMETHING THE AUTHOR WOULD WOULD WOULD WOULD LIKE [inaudible] THANK YOU. I THANK YOU SEE GETTING MY CLOTHES THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS CERTAINLY I HAVE -- LISTEN LISTENED ATTENTIVELY AND APPRECIATE THE ROBUST CONVERSATION AROUND THIS BILL WANT TO CLARIFY A FEW THINGS -- ONE BEING THAT -- YOU KNOW WITH INDIVIDUALS OF COOPER FAST THEIR FAITH IS BEING CHRISTIANS -- ARE WE FISHERMAN'S OF MAN AND NOT AQUARIUM KEEPERS. AQUARIUM KEEPERS VERY SELECTIVE. OF THE FISH THAT THEY PUT INTO OF C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; OUT OF KOREA.&lt;/c&gt;</u> BUT A FISH MAN A MAN IS WHATEVER YOU CATCH. YOU BRING IN. AND IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A FOSTER HOME. IF A FOSTER PARENT CHOOSES TO BE A FOSTER PARENT AND BRING THAT CHILD IN. I'M HOPING THAT THAT CHILD WILL RECEIVE THE SAME KIND OF SUPPORT LOVE -- GUIDANCE IN WHICH WE GIVE OUR OWN BIOLOGICAL CHILDREN. I'M HOPING THAT YOU KNOW ONE WE WOULD NOT HAVE TO CODIFY CERTAIN THINGS IN LAW -- IF THEY WORK BEING DONE SO RIGHT NOW AND FOSTER HOME. WE TALK ABOUT IN THIS BILL HI GENE. GROOMING. IT'S INDICATION THAT THAT'S NOT HAPPENING IN SOME OF THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM SO FOSTER HOMES THAT WE HAVE TODAY OR WE IT WOULDN'T BE NECESSARY FOR US TO PUT THAT IN THE BILL. TODAY AND SO WE THESE ARE RIGHTS THAT WE'RE SAYING THAT. MAKING SURE THAT OUR CHILDREN KNOW THESE INELIGIBLE RIGHTS THAT THEY HAVE MAKE SURE THE SOCIAL WORKER UNDERSTAND ABOUT THE RIGHTS OF THEIR CHILDREN WHEN THEY PLACING THESE CHILDREN INTO THE BOSTON IN A FOSTER HOME. WE WANT TO PROVIDE CHILDREN WHO ALREADY HAVE TRAUMA -- BUT OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE A NEW NARRATIVE A NEW NARRATIVE TO GROW UP TO BE YOU KNOW CITIZENS WILL BE WHO EVER THEY CHOOSE TO BE AND IDENTIFY WITH WHICH IS STILL LOVE THEM REGARDLESS. IF MY SON SAYS DAD I'M GET LOVE MY SON UNCONDITIONALLY WHY BECAUSE MY FATHER LOVE ME UNCONDITIONALLY. IN THE MIDST OF ALL MY FLAWS AND PITFALLS THE WHOLE NINE YARDS WE HAVE THE LOVE EVEN THOSE WHO ARE OUR FOSTER KIDS WHO HAVE GONE THROUGH TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE. AND WE'RE GOING TO SAY WE DON'T ACCEPT THEM WE SHOULD ACCEPT THEM AS THEY ARE AND NOT PUSH THEM ASIDE. AND BE REALLY FISHERMAN'S OF MEN I RESPECTFULLY ASK WHEN I VOTE.

I'M NOT SURE WHEN WE'LL SEE HERE MISTER KALRA. WELCOME WILL MOVE TO ITEM NUMBER FIVE AB. FOR EIGHTEEN OH BY THE WAY THE CONSENT AGENDA THE BILL THAT WAS PASSED THERE WAS AB. THREE TWENTY EIGHT WHICH IS MISTER MAIENSCHEIN SPELL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. AB FOR EIGHTEEN WOULD ESTABLISH EVIDENTIARY PRIVILEGE PROHIBIT THE DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATIONS MAY BETWEEN EMPLOYEE AND THERE YOU REPRESENTATIVE. PRIVILEGES AN EXCLUSIONARY RULE OF EVIDENCE THAT PROTECTS CERTAIN CLASSES OF COMMUNICATIONS FROM DISCLOSURE TO OPPOSING PARTIES AT FROM ENTRY INTO EVIDENCE IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. THE RATIONALE IS THAT ALTHOUGH CERTAIN INFORMATION MAY BE RELEVANT IT IS NONETHELESS EXCLUDED BECAUSE OF OVERRIDING SOCIAL INTERESTS. THE CALIFORNIA EVIDENCE CODE CURRENTLY CONTAINS A NUMBER OF SPECIFIC PRIVILEGES FOR CERTAIN COMMUNICATIONS INCLUDING COMMON PRIVILEGES BETWEEN ATTORNEY AND CLIENT OR POSITION AND PATIENT. ALTHOUGH IT IS UNFORTUNATE -- MANY WORKERS A FACE WHICH IS A DISCRIMINATION EXPORTER IN. A PLEASE ASSUME THAT SUCH COMMUNICATIONS DISCUSS WITH THEIR OFFICIAL YOU REPRESENTATIVE IS CONFIDENTIAL AND THAT INFORMATION MAY NOT BE DISCLOSED THE EMPLOYER OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES. HOWEVER NO STATUS TO A STATUE PROVIDE SUCH COMMUNICATIONS WITH AN EVIDENTIARY PRIVILEGE NORRIS CASE I RECOGNIZE SUCH A PRIVILEGE. THIS EXTENDS TO INSTANCES OF SEXUAL ASSAULT HARASSMENT AND DISCRIMINATION WHERE EMPLOYEE PREFERS TO APPROACH HIS OR HER HE REPRESENTATIVE RATHER THAN HUMAN RESOURCES DEPARTMENT. IN REPRESENTATIVES ARE IMPORTANT THIRD PARTY WHEN THERE IS REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THE EMPLOYER DOES NOT HAVE THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE EMPLOYEE. IN MIND. DURING THAT TIME -- WERE DISCRIMINATORY AN UNFORTUNATE EVENTS OCCUR IN THE WORKPLACE ADDITIONAL CONFIDENTIAL AVENUES TO REPORT THESE INSTANCES ARE IN GREATER NEED. BY ALLOWING EVIDENTIARY PRIVILEGED TO WORKERS AND YOU REPRESENTATIVES WE CAN HELP TO ENSURE THE SAFE PRIVATE AND FULL DISCLOSURE OF WORKPLACE CONCERNS AND NEEDS. AND WITH WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL WITH THE EROSION OF WORKERS RIGHTS AS BOTH A AND WASHINGTON DC BUT THE GOP ADMINISTRATION AS WELL AS THE SUPREME COURT. I THINK IT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER THAT WE ALLOW FOR AVENUES FOR WORKERS TO HAVE GREATER PROTECTIONS AS WELL AS THE UIT PRESENT LIVES THAT THAT WORK CLOSELY WITH THEM TO PROTECT THEIR RIGHTS. WOULD BE UP BY SUPPORTING TESTIMONY IRVINE ALISON -- POLITICAL LET'S SAY DIRECTOR. OF OVER ASKED ME -- REPRESENT REPRESENTATION SPECIALS THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU FIRST WITH US PLEASE. WITH THE CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE BRIGHT HOUSE IN ABOUT HALF THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF STATE COUNTY MUNICIPAL EMPLOYEES I'LL KEEP MY COMMENTS INCREDIBLY PRE FIGHT JUST LIKE TO THANK THE MEMBER FOR TAKE A TAKEN ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION ALSO LIKE TO INTRODUCE MICHAEL SEVILLE. ARE FROM -- APPS ME DISTRICT COUNCIL FIFTY SEVEN EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR TO PROVIDE SUBSTANTIVE TESTIMONY. THANK YOU NEXT WITH THIS PLEASE MORNING MR CHAIR MICHAEL SEVILLE WITH APPS ME COUNCIL -- FIFTY SEVEN PROBABLY REPRESENTING YOUR THIRTY THOUSAND WORKERS AT THE STATE -- CITY COUNTY UTILITY IN TRANSIT AND EDUCATION DISTRICTS I TOO WANT TO THANK. OF THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR SPONSORING THIS BILL IN JUST ONE HIT ON A COUPLE POINTS. THAT HE MADE IN HIS OPENING REMARKS -- HE IS RIGHT THAT WORKERS ARE UNDER ATTACK AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL -- BOTH COMING OUT OF CONGRESS AND THE SUPREME COURT WE SEE DALY DELUSIONS AYE WHAT WHETHER IT'S AT THE ADMINISTRATIVE LEVEL THROUGH THE NLRB. OR THE COURTS HANDING DOWN RULES FURTHER WE NEED THESE PROTECTIONS HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE'VE SEEN AN EXPLOSION OF LITIGATION IN THE POST -- JANICE WORLD -- EVERY DAY WERE CONFRONTED WITH THE EXCITING AND VERY IMPORTANT ME TO MOVEMENT AND GIVING WORKERS -- THIS SENSE OF CONFIDENTIALITY AND THE TRUST THAT THEIR CONVERSATIONS WITH THEIR UNION AGENTS. WON'T BE USED AGAINST THEM ARE DISCLOSED -- IN IN A JUDY COULD OF OR JUDICIAL -- PROCESS HAS NEVER BEEN MORE IMPORTANTTO GIVE WORKERS THAT FREEDOM TO TALK ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON AT THE WORKPLACE AND TRUST THAT NO IT WILL BE USED AGAINST THEM IN ANY OTHER WAY IF THEY DISCLOSE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION THAT THE EMPLOYER HAS NO RIGHT TO KNOW. SECONDLY NOTHING IN THIS BILL CHANGES THE EMPLOYER'S ABILITY TO CONDUCT WORKPLACE INVESTIGATIONS. NOTHING THEY CAN STILL CONDUCT ALL OF THE INVESTIGATIONS JUST AS THEY DO NOW WITH THIS BILL. THEY'RE ALLOWED TO CALL WITNESSES THEY'RE ALLOWED TO INVESTIGATE THE ALLOWED TO ASK QUESTIONS NOTHING PREVENTS OR PROHIBITS THEM FROM DOING THAT AND ALLOWS AN EMPLOYEE TO REFUSE TO ANSWER A QUESTION THAT IS DIRECTLY ASKED. BY THE EMPLOYER THEY SIMPLY HAVE TO CONDUCT THEIR OWN INVESTIGATIONS. AND THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO A QUICKLY MAKE CHAIR IS THAT. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A UNION AND A REPRESENTED EMPLOYEE IS UNIQUE. UNIONS HAVE UNDER THE LAW HAVE A DUTY KNOWN AS THE DUTY OF FAIR REPRESENTATION TO CONDUCT WORKPLACE INVESTIGATIONS AND REPRESENT OUR MEMBERS AND REPRESENT EMPLOYEES TO THE FULLEST -- EXTENT OF OUR CAPACITY THAT MEANS WE HAVE TO ASK QUESTIONS THAT MEANS THAT INFORMATION MAY JUST BE DISCLOSED DURING THAT PROCESS AGAIN THAT WERE LEGALLY OBLIGATED -- TO IT HERE. TO THAT SHOULD NOT BE -- FORCED TO BE TURNED OVER TO THE EMPLOYER -- AND IN A JUDY COULD EVER JUDICIAL SETTING AND I AGAIN I THINK THIS ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR DOING THIS BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS A BIG POINT THAT THERE IS A UNIQUE RELATIONSHIP -- THAT GOES ON WHEN WE RECEIVE A SUBPOENA BEEN DOING THIS FOR FIFTEEN YEARS I'M AN ATTORNEY I'VE DONE THIS IN PRIVATE PRACTICE AND I CAN'T TELL YOU WHEN WE GET A SUBPOENA FROM AN EMPLOYER AND A CASE THAT. THE IN THE UNION CONDUCTS AN INVESTIGATION IT'S DECIDED THAT IS A BETTER TO MOVE IT AND A QUARTER SOMETHING GET A SUBPOENA FOR THE EMPLOYER AND HAVETO TURN OVER THE INTERNAL NOTES AND COMMUNICATIONS THAT WERE MADE BETWEEN. THE WORKER AND THE UNION AGENT -- IS DEVASTATING TO THE BOTH PARTIES REALLY AND SO AGAIN THANK YOU SOMEONE MEMBER FOR FOR BRINGING FOR THIS REALLY IMPORTANT ALL. THANK YOU THAT'S WITH US PLEASE. GOOD MORNING CHAIR STONE AND THAT WAS THE COMMITTEE MY NAME'S JASON CONLON REPRESENTATION SPECIALS WITH CALIFORNIA FACULTY ASSOCIATION CFA AS A CO SPONSOR OF THIS BILL. WHEN I DISCUSS ISSUES WITH OUR MEMBERS I CAN TELL YOU THAT MOST OF THEM ASSUME THAT COP COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THEM AND ME ARE CONFIDENTIAL? AND THAT INFORMATION WILL NOT BE DISCLOSED TO THE EMPLOYER OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES -- IN REPRESENTED THROUGH THIS UNION COULD FAR MY UNION WERE UP TO ME WITH OUR MEMBERS ON A NUMBER OF SENSITIVE ISSUES INCLUDING WORKPLACE DISCIPLINE GRIEVANCES SEXUAL ASSAULT HARASSMENT CIVIL RIGHTS VIOLATIONS. AND EVERYTHING UNDER THE SUN. IS IMPORTANT FOR OUR WORK IN RESOLVING WORKPLACE PROBLEM STEP UNFILTERED CONVERSATION SO THAT WE KNOW EVERYTHING INVOLVED IN A SITUATION AND ON OCCASION TO SOMETIMES GIVE BLUNT ADVICE TO OUR MEMBERS. I HAVE THREE EXAMPLES TO SHARE WITH YOU THAT ILLUSTRATE THIS NEED FOR PRIVILEGED COMMUNICATION BETWEEN A UNION REPRESENTATIVE IN OUR MEMBERS. THE FIRST SCENARIO -- RECENTLY AT TWO SEPARATE ARBITRATIONS WE LEARNED THAT THE LONG BEACH STATE -- CAMPUS AND SACRAMENTO STATE YOUR THE MEMBERS TO FIND THEIR CORRESPONDENCE WITH UNION REPRESENTATIVES AND OTHER PEOPLE. THE CSU LAWYER COMMENTED THAT THERE IS NO PRIVILEGE BETWEEN A MEMBER IN THERE SEE IF A LEADERS AND ADVOCATES. EVEN WHEN THAT TOPIC IS TO ADVISE ABOUT ENFORCING THE CONTRACT EMPLOYMENT RIGHTS. BUT BY DENYING THE PRIVILEGE TO SEE IF YOU SEE AS YOU WAS ABLE TO TAKE EMAIL CORRESPONDENCE COMPLETELY OUT OF CONTEXT AND PRESENT THOSE ADDED AN ARBITRATION. THE SECOND SCENARIO A CFA FIELD STAFF MEMBER AT SAN JOSE WAS SERVED WITH A SUBPOENA FOR ALL OF FOR EMAILS WILL LIVE AGAIN WHO IS SUING THE CSU FOR CIVIL RIGHTS VIOLATIONS -- THIS LITIGANT HAD ENGAGED IN NUMEROUS HUNDREDS OF PAGES OF EMAILS WITH THE FAA ABOUT HER EMPLOYMENT RIGHTS AS A FACULTY MEMBER. IN THIS YES YOU GOT ALL OF THEM BECAUSE THE FIELD STAFF MEMBER COULD NOT AVOID COMPLIANCE WITH THE SUBPOENA THEY WEREN'T AN ATTORNEY. AND IN THE THIRD SCENARIO -- THERE WAS A RECENT INCIDENT IN WHICH A FACULTY RIGHTS ADVOCATE WAS ASKED. THAT'S A GOOD STEWARD -- WAS AFTER THAT A SUBPOENA TO PROVIDE COPIES OF EMAILS THAT SHE HAD WITH THE FACULTY LED TO GET IT CHANNEL ISLANDS. AT THE CSU SIMPLY WANT ALL THE ADVICE WE GIVE THE MEMBER OVER HER EMPLOYMENT RIGHTS AND FOR THIS ONE WE ADVISE THE FACT OF THE RIGHTS CHAIR TO WAIT UNTIL THERE'S A SUBPOENA. IF UNIONS COULD AFFORD AN ARMY OF IT OF LAWYERS THIS WOULDN'T NECESSARILY BE AN ISSUE BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT REPRESENTATION WORK IS PERFORMED BY FACULTY VOLUNTEERS A TRAINED STAFF. MOST MOST OF WHOM ARE NOT ATTORNEYS -- OF MY COLLEAGUES TO DO THE SAME WORK I DO OUR ATTORNEYS BUT I'M NOT. THIS MEANS THAT COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THOSE. TWO THOSE TWO COLLEAGUES AND MEMBERS IS PROBABLY CATION BETWEEN MEMBERS AND ME MAY NOT BE PRIVILEGED. THIS DESPITE THE FACT THAT WE DO THE EXACT SAME WORK. UNIONS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR WORKING WITH THEIR MEMBERS TO SOLVE PROBLEMS IN THE WORKPLACE OFTENTIMES ON VERY SENSITIVE ISSUES WE CAN SOLVE THOSE PROBLEMS MORE EFFECTIVELY IF WE CAN OF HONESTY COMPLETE COMMUNICATIONS WITH OUR MEMBERS WITHOUT WORRYING THAT OUR PLAYERS GOING TO SUBPOENA THOSE COMMUNICATIONS. WE WILL THAT IS APPROPRIATE -- RIGHT UNION REPRESENTATIVES PRIVILEGED COMMUNICATION WITH OUR MEMBERS WE ORGY TO SUPPORT A BEFORE EIGHTEEN THANK YOU THANK YOU. I WOULD LIKE. TO NO ONE ELSE IN SUPPORT IF YOU COULD COME FORWARD TO THE MICROPHONE AND GIVE YOUR NAME AND AFFILIATION PLEASE. MICHAEL YOUNG WITH CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION ANOTHER CO SPONSOR THE BILL AN ARCH RIVAL. MR MEMBERS PACMAN WITH THEIR AND READING ASSOCIATES REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF PROFESSIONAL SCIENTIST ORANGE COUNTY EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION AND PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERS IN CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT ON SUPPORT THANK YOU.

CENTER BURGER WITH THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE IS THERE OPPOSITION. TELL ME IF YOU COULD CLEAR THE TABLE FOR THE OPPOSITION THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MORNING. IS IS ON YEAH CAM STONE OF STONE ADVOCACY ON BEHALF OF THE CIVIL JUSTICE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA -- THAT CIVIL JUSTICE ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE ASSEMBLY BILL FOR EIGHTEEN OUR MEMBERS BELIEVE THAT READ RELEVANT EVIDENCE SHOULD BE ADMISSIBLE. IN TRIAL AND AVAILABLE TO THE JURY OR THE FACT FINDER IN ARBITRATION AND THAT THE WE URGE THE LEGISLATURE TO BE CIRCUMSPECT IT WHEN GRANTING. NEW OUR CREATING NEW PRIVILEGES JUDGES DO HAVE DISCRETION TO EXCLUDE SPECIFIC EVIDENCE FOR EXAMPLE OF ITS MORE PREJUDICIAL THAN PROBATIVE -- OUR MEMBERS AGREE WITH GOVERNOR BROWN WHO VETOED A SIMILAR -- THAT MEASURE BEFORE MEMBER RELATIONSHIP -- IS IS NOT ANALOGOUS TO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SPOUSES BETWEEN A LAWYER AND A CLIENT. BETWEEN A DOCTOR AND A PATIENT BETWEEN A THERAPIST -- AND THEIR PATIENT OR BETWEEN A CLERGYMAN PENITENT ALSO THIS PRIVILEGE IS IS DIFFERENT THAN THOSE OTHER PRIVILEGES IN THAT IT RUNS BOTH WAYS. BOTH THE WITH THE WORKER ARE AND THE REPRESENTATIVE -- MAY HOLD THE PRIVILEGE AND THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UNUSUAL CONFLICT IF FOR EXAMPLE THERE WAS A SITUATION WHERE THE INDIVIDUAL WORKER MAY HAVE A DIFFERENT INTEREST THAN THE UNION AS A WHOLE AND THE UNION REPRESENTATIVE COULD ASSERT THAT PRIVILEGE -- THERE FOR OUR ORGANIZATION REMAINS CONCERNS AND MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THIS BILL. THANK YOU THAT'S WITH US PLEASE. MORNING MR CHAIR JAPANESE -- WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES -- REPRESENT NEEDS OF MY COLLEAGUES WHO COULDN'T BE HERE. THIS MORNING FROM THE LEAGUE OF CITIES AND THAT CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION AND THE ASSOCIATION OF JOINT POWERS AUTHORITIES -- WANTED TO SHARE OUR CONCERNS WITH THE BILL AS WELL M. ABOUT THE THIS THAT PRIVILEGE WHICH IS DIFFERENT IN KIND FROM OTHER EVIDENTIARY PRIVILEGES NOT JUST IN IN DEGREE -- AND ARE CONCERNED THAT -- THIS PRIVILEGE COULD PAIN IN THE TRUTH OF A SITUATION. A LOT OF THE OTHER PRIVILEGES NOT THE SPOUSAL ONE OF COURSE REQUIRE A CERTAIN DEGREE OF OF TRAINING AND LICENSURE IT THAT INCLUDE AMONG MANY OTHER THINGS THE THE TRAINING FOR PEOPLE TO KNOW WHEN THEY HAD THESE PRIVILEGES APPLY. AT WHEN THEY DON'T AND SO WITH THAT WITH THOSE COMMENTS WE'D LIKE TO RESPECTFULLY. URGE YOUR OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU. THERE ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. YOU JUST COME FOR TO GIVE YOUR NAME AND AFFILIATION PLEASE. FAIR ABOUT JUST WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOL BUSINESS OFFICIALS AND OPPOSITION. JEAN HEARST HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE URBAN COUNTIES OF CALIFORNIA ALSO IN A POSITION. LARA PRESTON ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. ALL RIGHTS IN NONE OF BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS. THERE IS A MOTION IS THERE SECONDS. MR HOLDEN HAS THE SECOND THANK YOU MISTER KALRA N.. I THINK THIS LEGISLATURE DOES TAKE THIS VERY SERIOUSLY AND SHOULD WITH RESPECT TO ESTABLISHING. NEW EVIDENTIARY PRIVILEGES BUT IN THIS CASE I THINK THERE. THAT IS FAIRLY CLEAR THAT IT SHOULD BE ESTABLISHED AND WHEN WE LOOK AT WHERE WE'VE ALLOW THESE PRIVILEGES BEFORE. THE THE NATURE OF COMMUNICATIONS IS WHAT WE LOOK AT AND THE RISK OF THE INDIVIDUALS IS IS WHAT WE LOOK AT THE I THINK THE OPPOSITION THAT WAS COLOR BRINGS UP AN INTERESTING POINT IN THAT THIS. PRIVILEGES HELD SORT OF BY TWO DIFFERENT POTENTIALLY CONFLICTING AREAS AND I THINK FROM MY STANDPOINT THE BILL IS SATISFACTORY I'M RECOMMENDING AND I AND I DO HOPE WE PASS IT OUT TODAY. I THINK THAT'S ONE CRITICISM YOU MIGHT WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT HIS IN EACH OF THESE CASES IT IS THE DISCLOSURE OF THE INFORMATION WHO TYPICALLY HOLDS THAT PRIVILEGE AND CONTROLS THAT PRIVILEGE. AND I THINK IF WITH THIS WERE STRUCTURED. MORE LIKE. OTHER PRIVILEGES IN A SIMILAR WAY THAT THAT MIGHT. ALLEVIATE SOME OF THE CONCERN BUT I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WORTH LOOKING AT AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD. RIGHT OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS SEEING NONE MISTER KALRA YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF THE FEAR COMMENTS AS WELL AS THE COMMENTS ABOUT SUPPORT IN OPPOSITION. THIS BILL -- THERE'S NO DOUBT THE PROTECTING EMPLOYEE RIGHTS IS A CORE FUNCTION OF LABOR ORGANIZATIONS AND AND I I WANT. TO REALLY THANK FOR THE EXCELLENT JOB AND DOES AND DISCUSSING THESE ISSUES IN THE REPORT -- INCLUDING THE ISSUE REGARDING THE TWO WAY -- OF PRIVILEGE TO AND AS STATED IN THE REPORT. THAT -- UNION AGENT DOES OWE A DUTY NOT ONLY THE EMPLOYEE BUT ALL THE EMPLOYEES REPRESENTED BY THE UNION I THINK. IN THESE TIMES IT'S PARTICULARLY. IMPORTANT THAT WE RECOGNIZE THAT AND SO THAT A A SOMETHING THAT I'LL CONTINUETO WORK. WITH THE FUTURE COMMITTEES ON AS WELL AS AS AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD I HOPE -- THE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THAT ISSUE FURTHER -- AND IF MORE SPECIFICITY IS NECESSARY OR IF THERE'S MORE -- WORKING NEEDED IN ORDER TO JUSTIFY -- THAT TO A PRIVILEGE CERTAINLY UP BECAUSE YOU TO WORK ON THAT BUT I DO APPRECIATE THE THE AYE RECOMMENDATION FOR TODAY'S HEARING THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU.

THIS SAD BILL OF COURSE YOU US ALL LAST YEAR AND MOST OF YOU VOTED FOR IT AND IT TO GET VETOED BY OUR GOVERNOR AND WE'RE BRINGING IT BACK THIS YEAR AGAIN -- PER SECOND SHOT AB TWO EIGHTEEN EXTEND THE CIVIL STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS FOR IT VICTIMS OF CHILDHOOD SEXUAL ASSAULT FROM AGE. TWENTY SIX TO EIGHT FORTY IN CASES OF DOUBLE DELAYED DISCOVERY FROM THREE YEARS AFTER THE DISCOVERY. TO FIVE AND THE BILL WOULD ALSO INCREASE AMOUNT DAMAGES RECOVERABLE IN INSTANCES WHERE THERE WAS A COVER UP THAT LED TO FURTHER ABUSE AND ALLOW FOR SHORT THREE YEAR WINDOW FOR PAST VICTIMS TO SLIP THROUGH THE CRACKS. BASICALLY THE LONGER WE WAIT ON THE BUILD PATTERN UNFORTUNATELY OF ABUSE BY A NUMBER OF ENTITIES THAT -- DESPITE EXTENDING THE STATUE OF LIMITATIONS FOR CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR -- JUST HAVEN'T BEEN ADDRESSED IN IMPACT INSTITUTIONS THEMSELVES HAVE BEEN A COMPLACENT AND BEEN PART OF COVER UPS -- AND IN AS A RESULT MORE KIDS HAVE BEEN ABUSED IT'S TIME IT STOPS AND I THINK THIS BILL WILL HELP PUT AN END TO THIS PROLONGED -- BATTLE WE'RE HAVING UNFORTUNATELY IN SOCIETY WHERE WHERE AT THE EXPENSE OF ALL OF US CHILDREN ARE BEING ABUSED. BYE BYE FOLKS THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO TRUST AND INSTITUTIONS ARE HIDING IT SO -- WITHOUT A RESPECT LAST NIGHT ABOUT. THANK YOU PRESS WITH US PLEASE GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN STONE AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS JOE WELL CAST X.. I WAS BORN AND RAISED IN SANTA ANA AND STILL LIVE IN ORANGE COUNTY. I'M AN ADVOCATE FOR OTHER ADULT SURVIVORS OF CHILD SEXUAL ASSAULT LIKE MYSELF. I HAD BECOME ONE OF THE LEADING NATIONAL SPOKES PEOPLE ON BEHALF OF VICTIMS. AS A TEENAGER I WAS SEXUALLY ASSAULTED BY THE CHOIR DIRECTOR AT MY HIGH SCHOOL. HE DELIBERATELY TARGETED ME. BECAUSE I WAS VULNERABLE. HE KNEW I WAS POWERLESS. I HAD SPENT TIME IN A PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL FOR A SUICIDE ATTEMPT. MY MOTHER WAS AN ALCOHOLIC MY FATHER WAS IN DENIAL. I YEARNED FOR MENTORSHIP AND A STRONG ADULT FIGURE IN MY LIFE. I DID NOT YEARN FOR AN ADULT TO SEXUALLY ASSAULT ME. DURING THE TWO YEARS HE TARGETED ME I WAS THE SUBJECT OF REPEATED SEXUAL ASSAULTS AND RAPES ON SCHOOL PROPERTY AND ELSEWHERE. BY THE TIME I GRADUATED HIGH SCHOOL I WAS PREGNANT AND HAD A SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASE. AND LIKE MOST VICTIMS I LIVED WITH CRIPPLING SHAME AND SECRECY FOR MORE THAN A DECADE. I AM NOT A FAMOUS PERSON. I AM NOT A MOVIE STAR NOR A GYMNAST. I'M NOT A C. E. O. NOR CELEBRITY. BUT IT IS NO LESS ON ME WHEN A HARVEY WEINSTEIN OR A ROY MOORE OR LARRY NASSER CUT A SWATH OF SEXUAL ASSAULT ACROSS OUR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. IT IS NO LESS ON ME TO STAND HERE BEFORE YOU AND SAY THAT OUR LAW MUST CHANGE. WE HAVE SEEN A COMPLETE SHIFT IN OUR CULTURE WHEN IT COMES TO HOW WE VIEW CHILD SEXUAL ASSAULT. IT IS TIME TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT CULTURAL SHIFT. I HUMBLY URGE YOU. TO VOTE I THANK YOU. THANK YOU THAT'S WHAT IS PLEASE. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS MIKE FINNIGAN I'M AN ATTORNEY WHO WAS ASKED TO BE HERE ON BEHALF OF THE VICTIM POLICY INSTITUTE. THE ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESS IN SUPPORT. IF YOU COULD GIVE US YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION PLEASE. CAROLINE DON CAP YOU MAKE YOU KEPT CAN ASSOCIATES ON BEHALF OF CRIME VICTIMS UNITED OF CALIFORNIA ALSO IN STRONG SUPPORT [inaudible] THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING I'M NANCY PEPPERING ON BEHALF OF THE CONSUMER TRAITS OF CALIFORNIANS STRONG SUPPORT THANK. GIVE ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. RIGHT SIGNAL OPPOSITION THIS CHAIRMAN MEMBERS JOHN OR WOULD ON BEHALF THE INDEPENDENT INSURANCE AGENTS AND BROKERS OF CALIFORNIA -- WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THIS BILL CHANGING THE SPATULA TAKE HIS AGE FROM TWENTY SIX TO FORTY AND ANYTHING TO DO WITH PERPETRATORS THIS HOW THIS BILL APPLIES TO PERPETRATORS. NOW WE RESPECTFULLY HAVE TO OPPOSE THIS BILL -- IN THE VIEW OF OUR MEMBERS WE THINK THIS BILL IS SO RADICAL IN LIGHT OF WITH CALIFORNIA'S ALREADY DONE IN THE SPACE. THAT IT WILL EFFECTIVELY ELIMINATE THE ABILITY OF OUR MEMBERS TO SERVE -- BUSINESSES AND ORGANIZATIONS IN THEIR DISTRICT WHICH INCLUDE AMONG OTHERS OVER FORTY THOUSAND DAY CARE AND FAMILY DAY CARE FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA. OVER THREE THOUSAND PRIVATE SCHOOLS ZONING NINE THOUSAND SCHOOLS -- NUMEROUS CHILDREN'S HOSPITALS AND CLINICS AN UNTOLD NUMBER OF NON PROFITS IN VARIOUS -- JANITORIAL CONSTRUCTION AYE. TECH FIRMS THAT GO ON DO A SCHOOL CAMPUSES THAT MANY DISTRICT REQUIRED TO HAVE THIS COVERAGE -- INSURANCE IS ALL ABOUT BALLOTS AND WE WERE SEEING THAT IN THE FIRE KIND OF A SITUATION RIGHT NOW -- AND WE THINK THIS SKEWS THE BALANCE. CALIFORNIA ALREADY PROVIDES VICTIMS WITH A LIFETIME -- TO BRING THEIR CASES AGAINST AN EMPLOYER OF A PERPETRATOR -- CERTAINLY WE HAVE AGE TWENTY SIX RIGHT NOW BUT ABOVE AGE TWENTY SIX FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE AS LONG AS THERE'S REPRESSED MEMORY OR THE CLAIM OF REPRESSED MEMORY YOU HAVE IN. THE ABILITY TO BRING A CLAIM AGAINST THE EMPLOYER OF THE PERPETRATOR. A CALIFORNIA. IN ADDITION -- THE CURRENT STAFF NINETY X. STATUE WE HAVE RIGHT NOW -- THE IN ADDITION CALIFORNIA'S ONE OF ONLY FIVE STATES IF EVER WE OPEN THE STATURE LIMITATIONS -- NATIONWIDE WERE TWENTY YEARS AHEAD OF THE STATE'S THAT YOU'RE SEEING DEBATE THIS TOPIC NOW IN NEW YORK AND PENNSYLVANIA NEW JERSEY CONNECTICUT THOSE TYPES OF THINGS. SO WE'VE GOT WE'VE DONE THAT ONCE AND TO DO IT AGAIN I THINK SENDS. THE WRONG SIGNAL TO THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY THAT BASICALLY IS IN A SITUATION WHERE THE THERE WILL NEVER GET OFF A RISK -- IN ADDITION THIS BILL THEN ADDS TROUBLE DAMAGES IN A SITUATION NOT TO PREVENT FUTURE CONTACT. BUT RETROACTIVELY SO ESSENTIALLY YOU'RE PUTTING VICTIMS IT COME. FORWARD IN THE SECOND REVIVAL IN THREE TIMES BETTER POSITION THE VICTIMS A CELL JUST TEN YEARS AGO. I MEAN YOU YOU CAN'T CHANGE THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF WHAT HAPPENED IN THE FIFTIES SIXTIES SEVENTIES EIGHTIES WERE THERE IN FACT WAS COVER UPS YOU CAN'T CHANGE THAT AND SO. IT'S JUST AN INVITATION TO TROUBLE DAMAGES -- WILL LASTLY THE BILL CHANGES THE THRESHOLD FOR THE MOST LATE LAWSUIT SOMEONE'S AFTER TWENTY SIX OR IF THIS BILLS AMENDED TO FORTY AFTER FORTY OR YOU'RE TRYING TO SUE THE EMPLOYER. WHERE NOW UNDER CURRENT LAW THE EMPLOYER HAS TO HAVE SOME NOTICE SOME KNOWLEDGE THAT TO THEIR EMPLOYEE IF THERE IS IS? PROBLEMATIC AND THEN DIDN'T DO ANYTHING TO CHANGE THIS BASICALLY SAYS IT'S A WAR SO WITHOUT ANY NOTICE ALL THE EMPLOYERS ARE HELD TO THE HIGHEST STANDARD OF CARE OF DOING SOMETHING IS ESSENTIALLY STRICT LIABILITY FOR CASES ARE ALMOST. IMPOSSIBLE TO DEFEND SO -- POINT AND WILL DRIVE THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY AWAY FROM THIS KIND OF COVERAGE IN THAT WILL ACTUALLY RESULT IN SITUATIONS. THAT -- ARE MORE RISKY FOR CHILDREN IN THAT INSURERS IN ORDER TO GET THIS KIND OF COVERAGE DO THE JOB OF OF GUIDING OF TRAINING OF TELLING -- BUSINESSES ORGANIZATIONS WITH A NEED TO DO TO GET THIS COVERAGE WHAT KIND OF POLICIES THEY HAVE TO IMPLEMENT. AND SO WE THINK IT ACTUALLY MAKES A SAFER WORLD SO FOR THOSE REASONS -- THAT'S OUR POSITION AND APPRECIATE THAT BYE BYE. THANK YOU SEX WITH US WITH GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MY NAME IS SERRA BOTCHES REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOL BUSINESS OFFICIALS. AND OUR EDUCATION COLLEAGUES INCLUDING ACCESS CSPA THE CALIFORNIA JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY ANOTHER'S WITHOUT OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION. WE THINK ASSEMBLYMEMBER GONZALEZ FOR ALWAYS BEING A CHAMPION FOR VICTIMS AND WE SINCERELY WANT TO WORK TOGETHER ON THIS CRITICAL ISSUE. AS WE ARE SUPPORTED WITH THE NEED TO PUT WELL THIS THE ATTENDED IT REQUIRES AMENDMENTS TO ENSURE SCHOOLS CAN IMPLEMENT IN ORDER TO PREVENT THESE HORRIBLE ACTS FROM EVER TAKING PLACE AGAIN. WE PROPOSED TO COMPLY WITH EXTENDED STATURE OF LIMITATION TO AGE FORTY THIS CHANGE IS ESTIMATED - TO COST AT A MINIMUM AND IMPOSE A FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FROM DAMAGES AWARDS AND SETTLEMENTS THE COST CA RANGE AS HIGH AS HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. THIS ESTIMATE IS BASED ON OUR ESTIMATE OF THE NUMBER OF NEW CLAIMS TO BE MADE POSSIBLE BY RELAXING THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS SO THAT A PLANE TOUGH AS OLD AS FORTY YEARS OF AGE. CAN FILE A SEXUAL ASSAULT CLAIM WE HAVE ALL NOT YET DERIVED AN ESTIMATE AND FOR THE NEW CLAIMS TO BE GENERATED BY THE BILL'S OTHER PROVISIONS. TO RELAX THE STATUE OF LIMITATIONS OR THE BILL'S PROVISIONS CALLING FOR THE STRICT LIABILITY TO REPLACE NEGLECT NEGLIGENCE AS THE STANDARD TO DETERMINE LIABILITY BUT THESE PROVISIONS WERE CLEARLY AT A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT. TO THE NEW CLAIMS SIMILARLY THE BILL'S PROVISION CALLS FOR TROUBLE DAMAGES THAT ARE NOT YET INCLUDED IN THE ESTIMATES PROVIDED HERE. BUT THERE WILL ALSO ADDED SIGNIFICANT COST TO THE NEW CLAIMS BEING MADE AS PART OF THE SPELL. WE HAVE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS THE SPECIFIC CONCERNS WERE ASKING FOR THE REMOVAL OF TREBLE DAMAGES PROPOSED IN THE SPELL COUPLED WITH THE OTHER PROVISIONS OF THE BILL THIS COMPONENT WILL RESULT IN BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND COST TO SCHOOLS. TO SETTLE CLAIMS THAT ARE DECADES OLD AND OCCURRED UNDER. SCHOOL BOARDS AND ADMINISTRATORS ARE LONG GONE WE LOOK. WITH LITTLE TO NO EVIDENCE AVAILABLE SCHOOL DISTRICTS WILL BE FORCED TO SETTLE LAWSUITS RESULTING AND DIVERSION OF CRITICAL RESOURCES AND SERVICES FOR TWO DAYS STUDENTS. WELL WE CAN MAKE CHANGES TO SUSTAIN AN INCREASE STATUE OF LIMITATIONS THAT REQUIRES AN ADDITIONAL FOURTEEN YEARS OF COVERAGE FOR WHICH NO PREMIUM OR SAVINGS HAVE BEEN SET ASIDE. WE CANNOT SUSTAIN THE RISK AIMS TO HAVE ALREADY BEEN SETTLED AS THE BILL ALLOWS THEREFORE WE REQUEST ELIMINATION OF THE THREE YEAR REVIVAL WINDOW. WE'RE ALSO ASKING FOR CONSIDERATIONS OF REQUIREMENTS FOR SCHOOLS TO IMPLEMENT ZERO TOLERANCE PREVENTATIVE MEASURES WHICH INCLUDE STRICTLY ENFORCED PROCEDURES TO IDENTIFY AND ACT UPON ANY INDICATION OF BEHAVIOR THE CONSTITUTES ARE CUT LEAD TO SEXUAL ABUSE. PROCEDURES ALIKE IN DEPTH TRAINING FOR TEACHERS STUDENTS VOLUNTEERS AND OTHER SCHOOL PERSONNEL. THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE INTERPRETATION WHEN SEXUAL ABUSE HAS OCCURRED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE VICTIM IS GIVEN ALL NECESSARY MEDICAL COVER AND COUNSELING HAS ACCESS TO COMPENSATION WITHIN THE SHORTEST POSSIBLE TIME FRAME WITHOUT HAVING TO GO THROUGH A TYPICAL ADVERSE RURAL. PROCEDURE THAT FORCES THEM TO RELIEVE THE STRESS TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCES AND BOTTOM LINE BENEFITS ATTORNEYS WE MUST FOCUS ON PREVENTATIVE MEASURES AND INCREASED TRAINING TO ENSURE THAT THESE PROCEDURES ARE UNDERSTOOD AND STRICTLY ADHERE. TO WE NEED A COMPENSATION SYSTEM THAT IS FAIR AND REASONABLE AND DESIGNATED TO BRING SWEAT COMPENSATION BEING A PROCESS THAT MINIMIZES THE HARM TO OUR VICTIMS. WE NEED A STATEWIDE STRUCTURE AND SUPPORT TO FORCE ALL OF THESE MEASURES AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE NOT JUST WORDS ON PAPER. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND THOUGHTFUL DELIBERATION. THANK YOU OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. IF YOU COULD COME FOR TO THE MICROPHONE TO GIVE US YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION PLACE. JERMAINE SIN CALIFORNIA CIVIL LIBERTIES ADVOCACY IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING LEILANI I CANNOT ON BEHALF OF THE SCHOOLS ACCESS LIABILITY FUND IN OPPOSITION. LARA PRESS ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS ALSO IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU OTHER THAN OPPOSITION. I'D SAY NONE OF BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. IT'S IT'S INTERESTING THAT THE OPPOSITION AND I UNDERSTAND THAT IS IS FISCAL. BUT ONE THINGS THAT. WE LOSE IF WE ONLY LOOK AT FISCAL IS THE DAMAGE AND IN THE INDIVIDUALS THE VICTIMS WHO WHO HAD BEEN HURT. AND LOOKING FORWARD I WOULD HOPE WE PUT IN PLACE ALL OF THE PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES TO PREVENT THIS FOR THE FUTURE. BUT THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING. TRYING TO LIVE WITH A GREAT DEAL OF EMOTIONAL TRAUMA AND OTHER ISSUES AND SINCE IT SEEMS TO BE IN OUR CULTURE. THE REMEDY FOR ALL KINDS OF HARM IS MONEY. WRITE A CHECK AND YOU'RE ALL BETTER WHICH WE KNOW IS NOT EXACTLY TRUE. I'M NOT SURE WHAT ELSE TO DO AND SO ARBITRARILY KIND OF CLOSING THE DOOR. TO AND THEN STATURE LIMITATIONS ARE ARBITRARY STATEMENTS EIGHT CLOSING THE DOOR. TO DO THAT THE ONE REMEDY MONEY THAT SEEMS TO BE WHAT WE CAN PROVIDE. IS. IS A REAL CHALLENGE SO I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND THE FISCAL IMPACT I THINK THAT'S BUT THAT'S NOT THE QUESTION HERE. SINCE THE APPROPRIATIONS OR SOMEONE ELSE IS GOING TO NEED TO DEAL WITH THAT. FROM A POLICY STANDPOINT ENSURING THAT VICTIMS. HAVE REDRESS THAT'S REALLY WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT AND THAT'S WHY I ENJOY THAT AYE RECOMMENDATION. OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. RIGHT SIGNAL SKINS US TO MAKE LOVE WELL -- IN SOME WAY I'M HEARTENED THAT I FINALLY GOT AN ESTIMATED COST FROM SCHOOLS IN ANOTHER WAY I'M HORRIFIED. BECAUSE IF WE THINK THAT BECAUSE OF COVER UPS THAT THEY CLEARLY KNOW ABOUT IN INCIDENCES OF ABUSE THAT THEY CLEARLY KNOW ABOUT. THAT THERE'S HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN DAMAGE OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF DAMAGE OF SUITS THAT ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BE AND I HEARD THIS THEY'RE JUST GOING TO HAVE TO BE SETTLED -- THAT THAT THE LACK OF EVIDENCE GOES ON BOTH SIDES AFTER YEARS SO IF THEY'RE SUGGESTING THESE NUMBERS I I WOULD SUGGEST THAT THEY'VE KNOWN ABOUT THIS FOR A LONG TIME AND THEY'VE HELD THE KEYS TO CHANGING BEHAVIOR. I HAVE ANOTHER BILL TO TO DEAL WITH THAT SITUATION BUT IT'S MONEY IS IT IS NOT. THE PANACEA OUR SITE SHOULDN'T BE. BUT UNTIL YOU MAKE PEOPLE HURT THIS BEHAVIOR DOESN'T STOP AND WE'VE SEEN THAT THIS WAS THIS WAS TALKED ABOUT YEARS AGO IN THIS BUILDING PEOPLE MIL. YOU KNOW -- WE CAN WE CAN OPEN UP FOR A YEAR AND WILL TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF HURT AND THEN WE'LL MOVE FORWARD AND YET THIS CONTINUES TO HAPPEN. I WOULD I WOULD CLEAN THAT PROTECTING OUR CHILDREN IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WE CAN DO AND PROTECTING OUR CHILDREN IN PARTICULAR FROM CHILDHOOD SEXUAL ASSAULT. SOMETHING THAT WILL STAY WITH THEM AND WE KNOW STAYS WITHIN THEIR ENTIRE LIFE. IN AN UPSET EVERY ASPECT OF THEIR LIFE AND WE'RE SEEING MORE AND MORE THAT IT TAKES YEARS AND SOMETIMES DECADES TO DEAL WITH THAT TYPE OF PAIN. IF WE DON'T GET SERIOUS ABOUT THE COVER UP OF ADULTS WHO ARE HURTING CHILDREN SOMETHING THAT HAS HAPPENED SYSTEMATICALLY IN THIS COUNTRY FOR FAR TOO LONG IN THE STATE. THEN WE WILL NEVER STOP IT IN THE FUTURE. SOMEBODY WHO ABUSES HAS ON AVERAGE OF FIFTY ONE VICTIMS FIFTY ONE YEAH I WANT TO PUT IN PLACE SOMETHING. THAT'LL PREVENT. VICTIM NUMBER [inaudible] TWO NOT. TO SAVE A TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX THIS IS A IT'S ENOUGH IT'S ENOUGH IN EVERY DAY WE SEE IN THE MEDIA. THE THE THE EXTENT TO WHICH THIS IS GROWING THE EXTENT TO WHICH PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO SAY ARE THAT'S NOT TOO SERIOUS I AM HORRIFIED AT FROM THE THINGS I READ. ABOUT SUGGESTIONS THAT STATUTORY RATE BETWEEN OF A TEACHER AND A CHILD AREN'T THAT SERIOUS. THAT SOMEHOW WE'RE DOING THAT CHILD A FAVOR BY BY INTRODUCING THEM TO FAX AND THAT WAS IN THE NEWS TODAY. THIS IS WHAT PEOPLE THINK AND THAT'S WHY THIS IS NEVER BEEN TAKEN SERIOUSLY AND THAT'S WHY IT'S APPROPRIATE TO GIVE TREBLE DAMAGES TO THE COVER UP AND THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT. THAT WE ACTUALLY MAKE INSTITUTIONS FACE THE CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR PAST BEHAVIOR SO THAT WE NEVER ARE IN THIS POSITION AGAIN I RESPECTFULLY ASK AND I THANK YOU MOTION WE DO HAVE A MOTION A SECOND.
