ORDER THE HEARING OF THE PRIVACY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION COMMITTEE. OF BY JUNE NINETEEN TWENTY EIGHTEEN LET ME BEGIN BY WELCOMING OUR NEWEST MEMBER ASSEMBLY MEMBER JESSE. ARE GABRIEL TO OUR COMMITTEE. AND WE ALSO HOUSE -- NICOLE OUR O. SECRETARY SO WITH THAT WE HAVE TODAY WE HAVE A TOTAL OF EIGHT BILLS IN TWO OF WHICH ARE ON PROPOSED CONSENT. AND I NOTICED THAT SENATOR HILL IS ALREADY HERE SO WITH THAT WITHOUT FURTHER ADO LIKE ASKING TO COME UP TO PRESENT HIS BILL. AND HE HOUSE AS BE. THIRTEEN FIFTY FIVE WELCOME A SENATOR HILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR. AND MEMBERS SB THIRTEEN FIFTY FIVE MAKES IT ILLEGAL TO KNOWINGLY AND INTENTIONALLY OPERATE IN UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEM ON OR ABOVE THE GROUNDS OF THE STATE PRISON OR A JAIL. THERE ARE SEVERAL RECENT INCIDENTS OF DRONES BEING USED TO DROP CONTRA RAN INTO PRISONS AND JAILS FOR EXAMPLE. IN OCTOBER OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN A SMALL DRONE CRASHED INSIDE THE PERIMETER OF ELMWOOD CORRECTIONAL FACILITY IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY. INVESTIGATORS FOUND A PACKAGE OF MATH ONBOARD AN INMATE AT A HIGH SECURITY FEDERAL PRISON IN VICTORVILLE CALIFORNIA. RECRUITED SOMEONE TO USE A DRONE TO SMUGGLE INTO CELL PHONES IN MARCH OF TWENTY FIFTEEN THE PHONES WERE NOT FOUND BY PRISON OFFICIALS FOR FIVE MONTHS IN FEBRUARY NEAR DELANO'S KERN VALLEY STATE PRISON. A DRONE DROPPED A BAG FILLED WITH CELLPHONES SIM CARDS HACKSAW BLADES A HUNDRED EIGHTY GRAMS OF HEROIN. IN SIXTY NINE GRAMS OF MYTH THE FOLLOWING DAY STAFF FOUND THREE MORE BAGS CONTAINING DRUGS LIGHTERS AND ROLLING PAPERS AMONG OTHER ITEMS. WELL SMUGGLING CONTRABAND INTO PRISON OR JAIL THROUGH ANY METHOD IS ILLEGAL STATUTE CURRENTLY BARS DRONES FROM FLYING NEAR NO STATUTE CURRENTLY BARS DRONES FROM FLYING NEAR CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES. SB THIRTEEN FIFTY FIVE UPDATES CURRENT LAW TO MAKE CLEAR THAT USING DRONES TO SMUGGLE CONTRABAND INTO CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES IS ALSO UNLAWFUL. S. B. THIRTEEN FIFTY FIVE DOES NOT PROHIBIT DRONE TECHNOLOGY BUT INSTEAD CREATES A PENALTY. TO DEFEAT TERROR ANY UNAUTHORIZED PERSON FROM OPERATING A DRONE NEAT DRONE NEAR A PRISON OR JAIL FACILITY I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. MEMBERS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL PLEASE [inaudible] OPPOSITION. SEEING AND HEARING NONE LET'S BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS MISTER CALDERON GO. CENTER HELD THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I'VE DONE LEGISLATION IN THIS AREA -- TO TRY. TO PROHIBIT THINGS FROM BEING FLOWN OVER FENCES HAVE THAT WE ALL NO SHOULD BE FLOOR OVER FENCES ALONG WITH NOT INTERFERING WITH OTHER PUBLIC SAFETY TYPE UP -- SITUATIONS -- GOVERNOR VETOED THAT BILL I HOPE YOU HAVE A BETTER CHANCE -- WITH YOUR BILL BUT HAPPY SUPPORT I'M OF THE BILL TAKE YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH ERA. WHEN WE HAVE QUORUM THEN WE COULD TAKE THAT UP BUT ALSO OTHER ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS ARE? SEEING NONE I WANT TO THANK YOU ALSO SENATOR FOR BRINGING THE BILL FORWARD I WE HAVE SO MANY OF US HAVE SEEN HIS BILL IN FACT I UNDERSTAND THAT THE GOVERNOR VETOED SIMILAR. A BILL OF YOURS FROM LAST YEAR WE CHANGE THE PENALTY. FOR POSITION TO HOLD EXACTLY CHANGE SOLVE THAT PROBLEM EXACTLY THANK YOU VERY. OKAY HAD MISTER OBERNOLTE -- BAKER RESEARCHER CENTER I'M SUPPORTIVE OF YOUR BILL A AND I THINK YOU FOR BRINGING FORWARD I HAVE ONE CONCERN I JUST WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU. AND I JUST READING FROM THE BILL YOU'VE GOT A AN EXCEPTION INHERITED SAYS THIS SECTION DOES NOT APPLY TO ANY ENTITY FOR WHOM. THE FAA HAS AUTHORIZED THE USE OF THE UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEM IN THE UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS OPERATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE AUTHORIZATION. AND I'M SURE YOU'RE AWARE THAT THE FAA NOW REQUIRES. THE LICENSED IN THE DRONES THEMSELVES TO BE REGISTERED SO I'M CONCERNED THAT YOU COULD INTERPRET THAT AS BEING FAA AUTHORIZATION AND I WOULDN'T WANT ANYONE TO TRY TO USE THAT AS A WAY TO GET AROUND -- THE PRO THE PROHIBITIONS IN YOUR BILL SO I JUST WANT TO BRING THAT TO YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND WE WILL LOOK INTO THAT AND MAKE SURE THAT THAT DOESN'T TO FALL INTO A CRACK THERE'S I THINK IT'S VERY GOOD OBSERVATION THANKS. THANK YOU ARE WITHOUT THE WHICH LIKE A CLOSE HOW EXPECT WE ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME THANK YOU MISTAKE I THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE BUT AS SO I THINK. WAS JERRY WAS YEAH OKAY I NOTICED THAT SENATOR GALGIANI IS HERE SO LIKE TO WELCOME HER. SHE IS GOING TO PRESENT ON ITEM. NUMBER EIGHT SP THIRTEEN NINETY SIX WITH DATA SENATOR ANYTIME YOU'RE READY YOU MAY PRESENT. AND TO THE AVAILABILITY OF TECHNOLOGY INCLUDING GOVERNMENT WEBSITES IT'S CRITICAL THAT ON MY WEBSITES AND TECHNOLOGY BE ACCESSIBLE FOR PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES. SO THAT THEY CAN ACCESS INFORMATION SERVICES AND BENEFITS THAT THEY'RE ALREADY ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE. S. B. THIRTEEN NINETY SIX TAKES IMPORTANT STEP OF MOVING TOWARD ENSURING EVERY STATE AGENCY AND ENTITIES WEBSITE IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH STATE AND FEDERAL DISABILITY ACCESSIBILITY LAWS. THESE ACCESSIBILITY REQUIREMENTS HAVE BEEN IN THE LAW FOR YEARS BUT ENSURING THAT ALL STATE AGENCIES WEBSITES ARE COMPLIANT HAS BEEN LACKING. IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES HAVE THE SAME ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND SERVICES AS PERSONS WITHOUT DISABILITIES HIS PROPOSAL WOULD ESTABLISH THAT ACCOUNTABILITY. I HAVE WITH ME TO SPEAK ON THIS BILL CURTIS CHILD WITH DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA. AND JEFF TOM WITH THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL OF THE BLIND. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FAIR EITHER. THAT YOU VERY MUCH EFFORTS WITNESS PLEASE -- DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA -- WE'RE VERY PLEASED TO SPONSOR THIS LEGISLATION THAT WE THINK IS CRITICAL. TO ENSURING THAT WE'RE GETTING CLOSER TO HAVING ALL OF OUR STATE -- WEBSITES AND TECHNOLOGY SINCE WITH -- WITH DISABILITIES AS YOU KNOW THE LAW HAS BEEN IN PLACE FOR WELL DECADES OR SO -- AND THE CHALLENGE HAS BEEN WHETHER WE HAVE AS A STATE EXERCISED THE NECESSARY LEADERSHIP TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY GETTING TO THE PLACE -- THAT WILL ENSURE THAT ALL OF OUR STATE AGENCIES AND STATE ENTITIES WILL IT WILL MAKE THEIR WEBSITES A AVAILABLE AS YOU KNOW SO MANY SERVICES NOW -- SO MUCH INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE ONLINE AND DUH TO NOT MAKE THAT AVAILABLE TO PERSONS WHO WHO HAVE DISABILITIES -- RELATE DEPRIVES THEM AS THEY ARE OF THE OPPORTUNITY -- TO ACCESS -- THE IMPORTANT STATE SERVICES AND SO FOR THAT REASON WE WOULD -- URGE YOUR AYE VOTE I WOULD ALSO JUST LIKE TO THANK STAFF FOR THE EFFORTS THAT THEY WENT THROUGH IN MAKING I THINK TO SAY -- BETTER BILL FOR US. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. JEFF HOME OF THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL OF ONE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- ARE RATHER THAN REITERATE WHAT HAS ALREADY BEEN SAID I'LL JUST MENTION THAT. ON THIS BILL IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT WILL HELP INSURE THAT WE ARE ABLE TO NUMBER. ONE MEET FEDERAL GUIDELINES THAT WILL ENSURE COMPLY. WITH STATE AND FEDERAL LAW. GUIDELINES THAT ALREADY EXISTS AND THAT CAN RELATIVELY EASILY BE MET IF STAFF ARE AWARE OF THEM AND HAVE THE EXPERTISE TO IMPLEMENT THEM AND THOSE ARE REALLY THE TWO PROBLEMS. BUT THIS BILL CAN ADDRESS BY HAVING INDIVIDUALS. WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY WHERE THEY SHOULD BE TO GUY OF STATE AGENCY STAFF THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA WE CAN FINALLY. COME TO THE TIME WHEN ALL INFORMATION AND SERVICES. A CAN BE ACCESSED BY PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES THROUGH ONLINE. OTHER WEBSITES ANOTHER ONLINE METHODOLOGIES THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WE ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WHO LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL PLEASE COME FORWARD CLINTONIAN CALIFORNIA COUNCIL OF THE BLIND AND I DEFINITELY SUPPORT BILL THIRTEEN NINETY SIX THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. ARE THERE ADDITIONAL WITNESSES. IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. SEEING NINE OPPOSITION CNN. LET'S BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SCENE NINE I WANT TO THANK OF THE SENATOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD ALSO -- LET ME ALSO ACKLEY COMMENTS MADE EARLIER AND THAT IS IT JUST. VERY IMPORTANT FOR US. TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR STATE AGENCIES TO COMPLY WITH THE OUR REQUIREMENTS ACCESSIBILITY OR OTHERWISE AND AND UP THIS IS ONE GOOD WAY OF DOING IT. ARM. I UNDERSTAND THERE'S ANOTHER BILL A BONTA BUILT THAT IS SO ALSO -- TENDS TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE SAME SAME ISSUES SO I'M GONNA ASK THE SENATE TO TO LOOK TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY OUR CONFLICT BETWEEN YOUR BUILDING ALSO A MISTER BONTA SPILL. I UNDERSTAND BUT MISSED BAKER ALSO -- HAS A BILL LAST YEAR'S FOR ON SO I THINK THAT ALSO ATTEMPTED TO ADDRESS SOME SUMMER ISSUES SO I LIKE TO ASK YOU TO LOOK INTO -- THOSE TWO BILLS TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY CONFLICTS THERE SAY WITHOUT US SEEING NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS ARE WHICH LIKE TO CLOSE. AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THE COMMITTEE HAS PROPOSED SOME AMENDMENTS. CORRECTLY YES BUDGET AND I'M WILLING TO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS TO CLARIFY THE PURPOSE AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE NAY OFFICE ENSURE CONSISTENCY TO THE TERMINOLOGY USED. SECOND TO REMOVE THE PUBLIC REPORTING REQUIREMENT OF NONCOMPLIANT OFFICES IN FAVOR OF AN UPDATE OF THE STATE'S COMPLIANCE. WHAT THE SENSIBILITY STANDARDS WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGIES EXISTING ANNUAL IT REPORT? AND THIRD TO ENSURE THAT THE LIST OF STATUTES AND STANDARDS ARE USED CONSISTENTLY THROUGHOUT THE BILL IN EXISTING LAW AND MAKE THEIR CLARIFYING CHANGES. AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK TO HELP ME MAKE THIS A BETTER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE STILL DO NOT HAVE A QUORUM AND THAT WILL TAKE UP YOUR ITEM WHEN WE DO HAVE A QUORUM. SO THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE THANK YOU THANK YOU. I NOTICE OF SENATOR DODD IS HERE I STILL LIKE TO INVITE HIM TO UP TO THE WITNESS TABLE. AND PRESENT HIS BILL TODAY HE IS PRESENTING ARE SP NINE EIGHTY ONE AND THAT'S ITEM THREE ON THE AGENDA. WELCOME SENATOR DODD THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. CURRENT LAW SPECIFIES THAT WHEN A CUSTOMER WISHES TO PURCHASE A WATER TREATMENT SYSTEM FOR THEIR HOME. AND THEY SIGNED A CONTRACT WITH THE SELLER NO WATER TREATMENT DEVICE OR MATERIALS MAY BE DELIVERED AND NO SERVICES MAY BE PERFORMED UNTIL THE VERY END OF THE THREE DAY RIGHT TO BE. SEN PERIOD EXPIRES. THIS BILL WOULDALLOW FOR THE INSTALLATION OF WATER TREATMENT DEVICES DURING THE THREE DAY RIGHT TO RE SAID PERIOD. ONLY WHEN REQUESTED BY THE CUSTOMER. WATER TREATMENT COMPANIES UNLIKE OTHER -- AT SIMILAR DOOR TO DOOR SALES INDUSTRIES ARE UNIQUELY SINGLED OUT WITH THIS THREE DAY PROHIBITION AGAINST INSTALLATION. WHILE THE OTHER. SALES INDUSTRY OR ARE HELD TO THE SAME THREE DAY RIGHT TO RECEIVE AND CONSUMER PROTECTION STATUTE. THEY'RE NOT PROHIBITED FROM DELIVERING MATERIALS OR INSTALLATION DURING THIS TIME PERIOD. S. B. NINETY ONE CREATES PARITY IN THE APPLICATION OF THE LAW FOR WATER TREATMENT COMPANIES. FURTHER THE BILL STRENGTHENS EXISTING LAW REQUIRING THE SELLER OF THE PRODUCT TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL COSTS IN REMOVING THE INSTALLED WATER TREATMENT DEVICE WITHIN TWENTY DAYS OF CANCELED BY CUSTOMER. AND THE SELLER MUST ALSO RESTORE THE PREMISES TO ITS ORIGINAL CONDITION. I HAVE BUT JOSIAH YOUNG HERE ON BEHALF OF THE SPONSOR OF THE PACIFIC WATER QUALITY ASSOCIATION TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH EFFORTS WHEN HIS PLACE BUT YOU SENATOR THANK YOU -- CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS I'M JUST SHY YOUNG I'M HALFOF THE PACIFIC WATER QUALITY ASSOCIATION. AWARE THE SPONSORS OF THIS MEASURE IN TO BE TREATED AS THE OTHER LICENSE CATEGORIES -- UNDER THE PURVIEW OF THE STATE CONTRACTOR LICENSING BOARD ARE TREATED -- AS SENATOR DODD INDICATED AND WHERE BOMB URGING YOUR YES IN SUPPORT ON THIS THANK YOU VERY MUCH OUR NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. ABOUT MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS RICHARD MARCUSSEN ON BEHALF OF THE PLUMBING HEATING COOLING CONTRACTORS OF CALIFORNIA AND THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA CHAPTERS OF ASSOCIATED BUILDERS AND CONTRACTORS. IN STRONG SUPPORT A AND NOT ONLY OF OUR MEMBERS ARE PREPARED TO ABIDE BY THE STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS OF THE LAW BUT THE INTENT AS WELL. I KNOW WHEN IN OUR INDUSTRY IS LOOKING FOR A BLACK EYE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR CUSTOMERS ARE SATISFIED WITH THE EQUIPMENT OR IF FOR WHATEVER REASON THEY DECIDE THAT. IT'S NOT THE THE RIGHT OF FIT FOR THEM DURING THE THREE DAY RECISION PERIOD A TO RESTORE THE PROPERTY 21100% OF ITS A A STATUS BEFORE THE INSTALLATION WAS MADE WE SUPPORT THE BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. SEEN AN OPPOSITION. JUST FOR THE RECORD I LIKE TO NOTE THAT THE COMMUNITY DID RECEIVE A OUR LETTER OF OPPOSITION AS OF YESTERDAY. ARE FROM THE CONTRACTORS STATE LICENSE BOARD ARE. ALWAYS. WE DO APPRECIATE THE INPUT FROM THE BOARD. OF A GIVEN THE FACT THAT THE LETTER WAS RECEIVED WELL AFTER THE DEADLINE IS NOT REFLECTED IN THE COMEDIAN ALICE'S. AND JUST. OF FORWARD THE INFORMATION OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS AT THAT THE LETTER BASICALLY -- MAKES THE POINT THAT THE BILL CAN WHO CONFUSES THE LICENSE REQUIREMENTS FOR LICENSEES AND AND CONSUMERS BUT BUT AS FAR AS THE CAN. AND I THINK WERE TOTALLY FINE WITH THE PROVIDING DOT CONSUMER PROTECTIONS ARE LIKE TO ASK THE AUTHOR TO MAKE SURE YOU IF YOU DIDN'T RECEIVE A COPY OF THE LETTER YOU DO HAVE. THIS CHAIR WAS IT VERY GOOD THOUGH SO HAVING SAID THAT SO LET ME OPEN IT UP FOR QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS. COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SCENE NINE SO ON WHICH I CLOSE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WHEN WE DO A QUORUM THEN WILL TAKE A FEW BILLION. THANK YOU THANK YOU [inaudible] GOD. THAT SET OF STANDARDS THEN. SO GOT A SYSTEM DOWN PAT. ARE A BUT WAITING FOR OTHER MEMBERS SENATORS. MISTER KILEY HAS A BILL TO PRESENT SO AT THIS TIME I TO A TURN IT OVER TO HIM AND HE HAS ITEM NUMBER ONE ACR TWO ONE FIVE A TIME YOU'RE READY YOU MAY PROCEED. SHARON MEMBERS HAVE TODAY WE ARE. WE SHOULD FIRST BE A SOMEWHAT SYMBOLS ASGUIDING VALUES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. IN JUST THE LAST FEW YEARS SEVERAL BREAKTHROUGHS IN THE APPLICATION OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE HAVE UNDERSCORED THE TECHNOLOGY'S POTENTIAL FOR ECONOMIC. AND SOCIAL IMPACT. IN MARCH OF TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN GOOGLE DEEP MINES ALPHA GO BEAT THE WORLD'S REIGNING GO CHAMPION USING TACTICS SEATED IN SOPHISTICATION AND ELEGANCE STRATEGIES DEVELOPED OVER TWO MILLENNIA. OF HUMAN EXPERIENCE. IN NOVEMBER OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN TESLA ANNOUNCED THAT ITS VEHICLES HAVE COLLECTIVELY DRIVEN OVER THREE HUNDRED MILLIONMILES USING AUTONOMOUS STEERING AND NAVIGATION SURPASSING BY UP 240% THE SAFETY RECORD. OF HUMAN DRIVE OOPS. AND JUST LAST MONTH GOOGLE UNVEILED A NEW TYPE OF A HIGH A SYSTEM WHICH USES LANGUAGE INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM THAT OF A NATIVE SPEAKER TO MAKE RESERVATIONS. BOOK FLIGHTS AND SCHEDULE MEETINGS OVER THE PHONE. THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING. OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IS POISED TO DISRUPT DOMAINS THAT INCLUDE HEALTHCARE LAW FINANCE MANUFACTURING. AND EDUCATION. IN EACH AREA A AYE CARRIES THE POTENTIAL TO DRAMATICALLY IMPROVE ECONOMIC PROSPERITY AND HUMAN WELL BEING SO LONG AS IS DEVELOPED IN A MANNER THAT ENSURES SECURITY. RELIABILITY AND CONFIDENCE WITH HUMAN VALUES. THE PURPOSE OF TODAY'S RESOLUTION. IS TO IDENTIFY A SET OF SHARED VALUES THAT CAN UNDERPIN COOPERATION BETWEEN POLICYMAKERS A AYE RESEARCHERS. AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS AS WE WORK TOGETHER TO UNLEASH THE POSITIVE POTENTIAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. THERE'S PERHAPS NO BETTER VEHICLE FOR THIS THAN THE ASILOMAR PRINCIPLES. THE PRINCIPLES WERE DEVELOPED HERE IN CALIFORNIA AT THE CONVENTION SITE NEAR PACIFIC GROVE THAT IS THEIR NAMESAKE -- HERE IN JANUARY OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN OF THE WORLD'S LEADING A AYE RESEARCHERS ECONOMISTS LEGAL SCHOLARS AND PHILOSOPHERS MET TO DISCUSS HOW BEST TO ENSURE A AYE AYES DEVELOPS SAFELY [inaudible] AND ADEQUATE. THE RESULT OF THEIR COOPERATION. OR TWENTY THREE PRINCIPLES. PUT BRIEFLY THESE PRINCIPLES STRESS THE NEED FOR SAFETY STANDARDS COOPERATION AMONG A AYE RESEARCHERS AND POLICY MAKERS TRANSPARENCY PRIVACY PROTECTIONS AND ALIGNMENT. WITH HUMAN VALUES. MANY OF THESE PRINCIPLES HAVE PARTICULAR RELEVANCE TO THE WORK OF THIS COMMITTEE. SUCH AS THE PRINCIPLE THAT PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO ACCESS MANAGE AND CONTROL THE DATA THEY GENERATE. GIVEN A AYE SYSTEMS POWER TO ANALYZE AND UTILIZE THAT DATA. THE ASILOMAR PRINCIPLES HAVE BEEN INDEPENDENTLY ENDORSED BY MORE THAN TWELVE HUNDRED LEADING EXPERTS IN THE FIELD OF A AYE. INCLUDING STEPHEN HAWKING YOU ON MUSK AND DENNIS. HAS ABA A SOB EXPOUNDER OF DEEP MIND. HE BY ENDORSING THESE PRINCIPLES TODAY THE LEGISLATURE WILL MAKE AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP IN RECOGNIZING SHARED VALUES. THAT CAN BE APPLIED TO RESEARCH DEVELOPMENT AND LONG TERM PLANNING. I'M HERE TODAY WITH -- TO EXPERT WITNESSES. PROFESSOR ANTHONY GEARY TEACHES PHYSICS AT UC SANTA CRUZ IN ALONG WITH MIT PROFESSOR MAX TEGMARK IS A FOUNDER OF THE FUTURE OF LIFE INSTITUTE. THE FUTURE OF LIFE INSTITUTE A THINK TANK DEDICATED TO A AYE SAFETY RESEARCH AS THE SPONSOR OF THIS RESOLUTION. JERRY THE LAW IS A FORMER RESEARCHER IN ROBOTICS AND MACHINE LEARNING AND NOW SERVES AS THE TECHNOLOGY POLICY DIRECTOR OF THE ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH JEFFERSON WHEN HIS PLEASE WELCOME GOOD AFTERNOON. I'M ANTHONY GEARY PROFESSOR OF PHYSICS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT SANTA CRUZ. AND CO FOUNDER AND CO DIRECTOR OF THE FUTURE OF LIFE INSTITUTE WHICH HAS MENTIONED-- ADDRESSES. SOCIETY SHAPING NEW TECHNOLOGY SUCH AS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AS WE'VE HEARD ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND MACHINE LEARNING ARE SUDDENLY EVERYWHERE. FROM THE DRIVING DIRECTIONS I GOT COMING UP HERE THIS MORNING TO CARS WILL SOON DRIVE THEMSELVES. ALONG WITH SYSTEMS THAT RECOGNIZE SPEECH AND FACES TRANSLATE DOCUMENTS ORGANIZE NEWS FEEDS TO FEET GO MASTERS. EVEN SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND SO ON IN JANUARY OF LAST YEAR THE INSTITUTE CONVENE A MEETING AND SO MARK CALIFORNIA. TO BRING TOGETHER PRIME MOVERS IN A AYE AND RELATED FIELDS TO DISCUSS AN URGENT QUESTION. GIVEN THIS RECENT EXPLOSION IN CAPABILITY AND ADOPTION OF A AYE. HOW DO WE ENSURE OVER THE COMING DECADES AYE AYE AYES NOT JUST POWERFUL? AND NOT JUST PROFITABLE BUT BENEFICIAL. WE SEARCH FOR THIS GROUP A PARTICULAR TASK TOGETHER PROPOSALS REGARDING A AYE POLICY AND DISTILL THEM INTO A SET OF PRINCIPLES THE GUY TECHNOLOGISTS POLICY MAKERS AND OTHERS. THIS PROCESS I WOULD SAY IT SUCCEEDED BEYOND OUR EXPECTATIONS RESULTING IN TWENTY THREE PRINCIPLES IS LISTED IN THE RESOLUTION. I WITH EXCELLENT CONSENSUS ON THEM. THEY BROAD SUPPORT AS WE'VE HEARD FROM THE HEADS OF A AYE RESEARCH A COMPANIES INCLUDING GOOGLE DE MINED FACEBOOK OPEN A AYE GOOGLE BRAIN. APPLE AND OVER A THOUSAND MORE A AYE RESEARCHERS AS WELL AS LEADERS IN THE CALIFORNIA TECH INDUSTRY LIKE YOU ON MOSQUEIN SAM ALTMAN AND ACADEMICS FROM THE LATE STEPHEN HAWKING. TO A AYE PIONEER STUART RUSSELL AND PETER NORFOLK ALSO CALIFORNIANS. PART OF WHAT MAKES THIS CONSENSUS POSSIBLE I THINK IS THAT MANY OF THESE PRINCIPLES ARE ALMOST SELF EVIDENTLY DESIRABLE. WE ALL WANT AND I SYSTEMS THAT ARE SAFE THAT ARE UNDERSTANDABLE THE RESPECT OUR LIBERTY AND PRIVACY AND RIGHTS. SUPPORT OUR SHARED PROSPERITY MITIGATE RISKS AND KEEP US HUMANS IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT. WE ALL KNOW THAT THESE DESIRES ARE FAR FROM SELF FULFILLING SAFE TECHNOLOGIES DON'T HAPPEN BY THEMSELVES PRIVACY IS NOT AUTOMATICALLY RESPECTED. CIVIC PROCESSES ARE NOT INHERENTLY IMMUNE FROM SUBVERSION. ENSURING THAT LOOK BENEFIT OF TECHNOLOGY TAKES ACTIVE EFFORT AND PARTICIPATION FROM RESEARCHERS DEVELOPERS POLICY MAKERS SUCH AS YOURSELVES AND THE PUBLIC. CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN AND WILL BE THE BIRTHPLACE OF MANY CUTTING EDGE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES INCLUDING AYE AYE. IT WAS POSSIBLE IN VITAL FOR CALIFORNIA TO TAKE THE LEAD ALSO AND HOW THOSE TECHNOLOGIES CAN BE USED FOR THEIR ULTIMATE PURPOSE. TO BETTER HUMANS LIVES AND SOCIETIES FUNCTIONING. LIKE YOU SAW MY PRINCIPLES IT ENDORSES THIS PRINT THIS RESOLUTION DOES NOT OF COURSE BY ITSELF REQUIRE ANYONE TO DO ANYTHING. RATHER WE HOPE IT WILL INSPIRE SIMILAR ACTIONS ELSEWHERE. AND HELP HIGHLY THESE PRINCIPLES A SET OF CORE ASPIRATIONS TO HELP A AYE REVOLUTION HAPPENED IN ITS BENEFICIAL AWAY AS POSSIBLE FOR ALL [inaudible] THANK YOU. TAKE IMAGINEXT WHEN HIS PLACE. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS JEREMY KULA -- HAS -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER KILEY SAID I'M A TECHNOLOGIST AND TAKE POLICY DIRECTOR AT THE ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION -- PRIOR TO JOINING YET THAT I RECEIVE MY PHD IN COMPUTER SCIENCE FROM STANFORD WHERE MY RESEARCH FOCUSED ON HOW TO GUARANTEE SAFETY FOR MACHINE LEARNING SYSTEMS. PART OF THAT IRON MY BACHELORS DEGREE AT ANOTHER GREAT CALIFORNIA SCHOOL CAL TECH -- WHERE I SPENT MY SUMMERS DOING RESEARCH ON AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES? NOW PART OF MY AND IT EFF IS THE WAY A AYE SYSTEMS WILL IMPACT PRIVACY AND CIVIL LIBERTIES. WHEN THE UP THAT WAS FOUNDED ALMOST THREE DECADES AGO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE WAS THE STUFF OF CYBERPUNK SCIENCE FICTION STORIES? NOW A AYE IS A REALITY AND IS VERY QUICKLY PERMEATING OUR LIVES FROM THE ALGORITHMS THAT DETERMINE WHAT ADS WE SEE ONLINE TO FACE RECOGNITION SYSTEMS TO THE SOFTWARE THAT DRIVES AUTONOMOUS CARS AND THAT'S JUST THE BEGINNING. THE STATE OF THE ART IS ADVANCING RAPIDLY. YEAH I PRESENTS ENORMOUS OPPORTUNITIES TO MAKE TECHNOLOGY WORK BETTER FOR SOCIETY BUT IT ALSO COMES WITH GREAT RISK. YEAH I SYSTEMS THAT ARE CAREFULLY DESIGNED OVER A LITTLE THOUGHT WAS GIVEN TO THE ACCURACY OF THE TRAINING DATA USED. CAN RESULT IN OUTCOMES THAT ARE UNFAIR OR BIASED. THIS CAN HAPPEN EVEN IF THE DESIGNER DIDN'T HAVE MALICIOUS INTENT. IN ORDER TO AVOID OUTCOMES LIKE THIS TECHNOLOGISTS AND LAWMAKERS NEED TO CAREFULLY THINK THROUGH HOW THEY'RE DESIGNING AND DEPLOYING NEW A AYE SYSTEMS AND HOW THEY WILL BE PUT INTO. DOCUMENTS LIKE THE ASILOMAR A AYE PRINCIPLES CAN HELP IN THIS REGARD. THEY DON'T PROVIDE ALL THE ANSWERS BUT THEY DO A VERY GOOD JOB OF HELPING US FLAG THE SORTS OF ISSUES WE NEED TO THINK THROUGH. MANY OF THEM MAY SEEM OBVIOUS BUT WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THESE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES HAVE BEEN MISSED BY THOSE DEVELOPING AND DEPLOYING A AYE SYSTEMS. THESE PRINCIPLES REPRESENT A STEP FORWARD IN THE RESPONSIBLE DEVELOPMENT TODAY I AND WILL HELP US ENSURE THAT A AYE BENEFITS BENEFITS US ALL AS WE ENTER THE SCIENCE FICTION FUTURE. THANK YOU KNOW THE COURT YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHAU ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL PLEASE COME FORWARD. SEEN AN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE LET'S BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE MISTER CALDERON GO AHEAD -- ONES ARE YOU FOR BRINGING THE RESOLUTION FOR MY OFFICE IS ACTUALLY BEEN LOOKING AT INTO ISSUES REGARDING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE -- YOU KNOW RECENTLY ALONG MOSQUE -- PAID FOR US OUR DOCUMENTARY TO BE ONLINE FOR A LITTLE WHILE IT'S CALLED THE TRUSSES COMPUTER AND OF ANY OF YOU HAVE BEEN AT AT OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT IT TALKS ABOUT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IS PROGRAMMING CODE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. YOU KNOW LIKE CERTAIN COMMANDS AND THEN THERE'S A THOMAS. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IS FREE THINKING I THINK THE CONCERN THAT I HAVE RIGHT NOW IS THAT WE HAVE STE COMPANIES THAT ARE -- NOT REALLY STOPPING TO THINK ABOUT IS OF WORKING ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE -- AND AT ANY POINT TIME COULD RELEASE A COMPLETELY INDEPENDENT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENT BEING OVER THE NETWORK AND ONCE IT'S OUT THERE THERE'S NO THERE'S NO STOPPING IT. THERE IS NO ON OFF BUTTONTO ANY TYPE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ONCE IT'S ONCE PERMEATED THROUGHOUT OUR NETWORKING THROUGHOUT OUR SYSTEM THERE'S NO STOPPING IT OTHER THAN STE. MAYBE SHUTTING DOWN THE ENTIRE SYSTEM WHICH A IS NOT REALLY FEASIBLE POWER NOT POSSIBLE LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD BE HURT BY THAT AND I I I I STILL QUESTION THE THE REALITY BEING ABLE TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT. SO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE I THINK IS SOMETHING THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BEING THAT WE ARE THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD WE ARE THE HOME TO THE TECH INNOVATION SECTOR. AND PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT US WORLDWIDE TO SEE WHAT WE DO ON THESE ISSUES IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME AND A LOT OF ENERGY FOCUSING ON THIS BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW GOOGLE'S DOING BEHIND THE SCENES RIGHT NOW OTHER COMPANIES DO BEHIND THE SCENES RIGHT. NOW THAT COULD POTENTIALLY UNLEASH AN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENT BEING THROUGHOUT OUR NETWORK AND ONCE IT'S OUT THERE AGAIN WE HAVE NO ABILITY THERE'S NO ON AND OFF SWITCH IT'S IT. IT'S DONE AND SO I THINK YOU I'M I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH THAT WITH THE PRINCIPLES I APPRECIATE THE RESOLUTIONS AND I CAN I CAN I GO IN AND SPEND SOME MORE TIME LOOKING OUT THE PRINCIPLES ACTUALLY DO BUT IT REALLY IS IMPORTANT THAT WE PUT A LOT OF TIME. AND ENERGY OUT INTO THE SUBJECT MATTER BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT OUR LIVES OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW AND KNOW THE DIFFERENCE AND AGAIN. YOU KNOW THE TECHNOLOGY THAT HAS BEEN USING THAT AS MORE COATED TO GIVE A CERTAIN COMMAND -- LIKE. I SEARCH FOR THESE THIS TYPE OF INFORMATION ONLINE AND THEREFORE I'M EXPOSED TO THAT TYPE OF INFORMATION ONLINE I THINK THAT'S ACTUALLY DETRIMENTAL. I END AND I THINK PART OF WHY WE ARE SEEING SUCH DIVERSE OF POLITICAL -- SPEECH OUT THERE RIGHT NOW IS BECAUSE WERE ONLY BEING FED WHAT AN ALGORITHM BELIEVES WE SHOULD. SEE OR WHAT THEY THINK WE WANT TO SEE WHAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO SEE OPPOSING POSITIONS IN A BEEN OPPOSING POINTS OF VIEW SO I THINK THAT. IT IS ABSOLUTELY THE PLACE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO GET INVOLVED AT LEAST FOR OUR OWN STATE. BECAUSE WE ARE LOOKING AT OTHER PEOPLE LOOKING AT US FOR LEADERSHIP BUT ALSO TO TO REALLY PUSH THE ENVELOPE TO ENCOURAGE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO DO SOMETHING BECAUSE THERE'S A LACK OF REGULATION BECAUSE IS LACK OF UNDERSTANDING IS A LACK OF INTEREST. AND IT'S KIND OF THIS -- ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE A THING OF THE MOVIES. MORE IT IS A REALITY IT IS HERE. AND WE NEED REAL REGULATION WHEN MS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE SO I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE MEASURE WHENEVER WE CAN OPPORTUNITY MOVE AT ALL MOVE IT I WOULD APPRECIATE YOU ARE BRINGING THE MEASURE. FOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF MISTER OBERNOLTE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I ALSO WILL BE SUPPORTING THE RESOLUTION I I HAD A COUPLE OF CONCERNS THAT I JUST WANTED TO VOICE BECAUSE I MEAN THIS IS A SET OF VALUES THAT WERE ADOPTED OUT OF THE CONFERENCE AND WE ARE POLICY BODY. SO WE WORRY ABOUT HOW THOSE VALUES TRANSLATE INTO POLICY AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT. WAYS IN WHICH I THINK THAT SOME OF THE VALUES EXPRESSED IN THIS RESOLUTION. NOW AND IN THE CAR OUTPUT OF THE CONFERENCE ARE GOING TO HAVE DIFFICULTY GETTING TRANSLATED INTO POLICY AND I JUST WANTED TO TALK ABOUT A COUPLE OF THEM. BOB FIRST FAILURE TRANSPARENCY IT SAYS IF A NAY I SYSTEM CAUSES HARM RICHARD PIPE POSSIBLE TO ASCERTAIN Y. WHICH I TOTALLY AGREE WITH. AND THIS IS A REALLY DIFFICULT THING TO DO WITH ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE BECAUSE BY DEFINITION A AYE IS A NON I MEAN IT IT'S IT'S WE DO IT WE IMPLEMENTED DETERMINISTIC KLAY. BUT THE OUTCOME OF OF THE NAY AYE CALCULATION IS NOT DETERMINISTIC SO. I IF YOU DO SOMETHING WITH MACHINE LEARNING THEIR IT'S IT'S REALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO GO BACK AND SAY WHY DID YOU MAKE THAT DECISION IT'S WELL CAN YOU TRAIN ME ON ALL THESE DIFFERENT DATA SETS AND I SUMMED UP ALL THESE WEIGHTS ON THESE DIFFERENT NEURONS AND THAT'S THE OUTPUT. THAT I SELECTED AND YOU CAN'T SAY WELL WHY DID YOU SAY THAT YOU KNOW -- YOU DID HARM WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT TO RETRAIN IT RIGHT SO IT IT'S THIS IS A CRITICALLY CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. HOWEVER WE KNOW BY DEFINITION BECAUSE WERE WERE LYING ON A AYE TO MAKE THESE LEAPS -- OF OF LOGICAL THINKING ARE BY DEFINITION WE'RE NEVER GOING TO BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THAT EXACTLY -- ANOTHER ONE HAS RESPONSIBILITY THE CONFERENCE SAYS THAT DESIGNERS AND BUILDERS OF A AYE SYSTEMS ARE STAKEHOLDERS IN THE MORAL IMPLICATIONS OF THEIR USE MISUSE AND ACTIONS WITH A RESPONSIBILITY TO SHAPE THOSE IMPLICATIONS. AND THAT IS GREAT AS A VALUE. OUR I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE THINKING ABOUT THE POLICY IMPACT THOUGH THAT VALUE BECAUSE IF YOU EQUATE RESPONSIBILITY WITH LIABILITY. THEN IT COULD HAVE A VERY CHILLING IMPACT ON THE DEVELOPMENT AND THE DEPLOYMENT OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE CAN IMAGINE IF YOU. OVER WORD A DEVELOPER OF ANY AYE SYSTEM AND OUR LEGAL SYSTEM PUT RESPONSIBILITY FOR EVERY SINGLE MISTAKE THAT THAT PIECE OF A I MADE AND ITS ENTIRE COMMERCIAL LIFETIME ON YOU. YOU CAN SEE THAT THAT WOULD NOT BE A COMMERCIALLY VIABLE THING TO DO. AND THE LAST THING I WANT TO TALK ABOUT WAS OTHER VALUES IN HERE HUMAN VALUES IT SAYS A AYE SYSTEM SHOULD BE DESIGNED AND OPERATED. SO AS TO BE COMPATIBLE WITH THE IDEALS OF HUMAN DIGNITY RIGHTS FREEDOMS AND CULTURAL DIVERSITY -- AS A POLICY MAKER I UNDERSTAND WHAT THOSE ARE. A IS A COMPUTER SCIENCE I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE A I AM EVEN EVEN THOUGH IT IS ANTHROPOGENIC IT IS NOT ANTHROPOMORPHIC. THEY AYE SYSTEMS LOOK AND THINK NOTHING LIKE HUMANS DO AND TO THE EXTENT THAT IT A AYE HOUSE IN RESPECT VALUES. IT'S ONLY TO THE EXTENT THAT WE PROGRAM IT TO DO THAT. AND I'M NOT EVEN SURE HOW YOU WOULD TRANSLATE THAT INTO POLICY ADMIN IF YOU'RE DESIGNING A SORT OF A AYE. TO TO TRY AND FIGURE OUT WHAT LIFE EXPECTANCY IS FOR LIFE INSURANCE ACTUARIAL TABLES FOR EXAMPLE. HOW WOULD YOU ANSWER THE QUESTION AS IT RESPECTING CULTURAL DIVERSITY WHEN IT DOES THAT? SO I I JUST WANT TO CAUTION US THAT IT'S IT'S GREAT TO ADOPT THESE IDEALS BUT WE NEED TO BE VERY VERY CAREFUL AS WE TRANSLATE THEM INTO POLICY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE DOING IT IN WAYS THAT ARE WORKABLE AND THAT ARE USEFUL. SO SORRY FOR THE MONARCH KNOW THANK YOU VERY MUCH DO YOU KNOW IT'S COUNT ON A FELLOW EYE CONTACT GRAD TO STIR THE POT OF THE MINNESOTA. THAT'S WHAT WE DO -- AYE I I I I I THINK THERE'S A GREAT POINTS I AM I DON'T THINK OUR INTENTION IS TO SAY THAT EACH OF THESE PRINCIPLES NECESSARILY HAS A A POLICY QUARREL IT -- OR CONCRETE POLICY THAT I THINK -- MORE THE THINKING IS THAT -- I YOU KNOW IN THE COMING YEARS ADVANCEMENTS AND I ARE GONNA -- YOU KNOW I TRANSFORM THE WAY WE APPROACH PERHAPS EVERY POLICY AREA AT THAT WE DEAL WITH THAT AT THE CAPITOL HERE AND SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT -- WE AT LEAST START TO KIND OF THINK ABOUT THAT IN THESE PRINCIPLES I THINK PROVIDE US A REALLY GOOD BASIS TECH KIND OF GROUND THAT THOUGHT PROCESS AND DISCUSSION IN THAT ARE OF YOU. ANYONE THAT -- YEAH I WOULD JUST AGREE WITH THAT IN THAT -- THESE PRINCIPLES AS ENVISIONED BY THE PEOPLE WHO ARE WRITING THE MORE. I THINK DID NOT HAVE THE INTENTION OF EACH ONE WOULD TRANSLATE INTO A POLICY BUT SOME OF THEM MIGHT TRANSLATE INTO OTHER THINGS FOR EXAMPLE. YOU BROUGHT UP THE ISSUE OF FAILURE TRANSPARENCY AND EXPLAIN ABILITY AND I SYSTEMS WHICH IS. AS YOU MENTIONED TERRIBLE AT THE MOMENT YOU SORT OF THERE'S NO ANSWER TO WHY DID YOU DO THAT OTHER THAN. THOSE WITH IT THAT WAY TO MY NARAL NETWORK SAID BUT THAT IS A RESEARCH PROGRAM OF LOOKING FOR HOW TO CREATE MACHINE LEARNING SYSTEMS THAT DO HAVE SOME LEVEL OF TRANSPARENCY AND EXPLAIN ABILITY SO. HAVING A CAN ENCOURAGE INVESTMENTS AND EFFORT PUT INTO RESEARCH THAT ON THE TECHNICAL SIDE BRING SOME OF THOSE CAPABILITIES INTO BEING AND THEN. IF THERE IS A TECHNICAL CAPABILITY DO IT THEN YOU CAN THINK OF IS THEIR POLICY THAT THEY COULD ENCOURAGE THAT ARE EVEN REQUIRED IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE SAY SAFETY WAS VERY CRITICAL OR SOMETHING -- SO I THINK THE SOME OF THEM MAY TRANSLATE MORE LESS DIRECTLY IN A POLICIES BUT OTHERS ARE MORE ASPIRATIONAL GOALS IT MIGHT MIGHT ENCOURAGE RESEARCH OR MIGHT ENCOURAGE -- A AYE RESEARCHERS THEMSELVES TO THINK DIFFERENTLY ABOUT THINGS THAT WOULD IT'S IT'S COVERING ALL THOSE DIFFERENT FACES I WOULD SAY. FOR NOW I I REALIZE THAT AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT. THE INTENTION WAS NOT TO TRANSLATE DIRECTLY INTO POLICY HOWEVER I JUST WANTED TO CAUTION EVERYONE BECAUSE WE ARE ADOPTING AND SUPPORTING IT THAT WE NEED TO START THINKING ABOUT HOW THEY WILL GET TRANSLATE INTO POLICY. BECAUSE IN FUTURE YEARS WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GRAPPLE WITH THAT ISSUE. I THINK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. SEEING NINE THAT WAS NICE OF VERY NICE EXCHANGE AND I WANNA THANK GOD THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS ACR FORD. AND ARE YOU MAY RECALL THAT -- BACK IN MARCH WE WE THE COMMITTEE HAD A HEARING ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE WHERE WE INVITED OUT. OF VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS TO BE A PART OF IT AND INCLUDING OF INDUSTRY FOLKS -- ACADEMIA AS WELL AS LABOR FOLKS THAT YOU TO EXPLORE SOME OF THE IS THAT MAYBE IT THAT MAY BE FORTHCOMING. AND THAT WAS A VERY PRODUCTIVE -- HEARING AND DUCKS ARE OUT THERE AFTER I HAD A CHANCE TO BE PART OF ANOTHER BECAUSE CONFERENCE IN FACT -- WITHOUT FOLKS FROM OTHER OTHER COUNTRY AND WHERE I LEARNED -- FROM ARE THESE OTHER -- PEOPLE THAT THEY WERE HEAVILY AND INVESTING IT INTO A AYE AS WELL. AND THEY ALWAYS ALWAYS WANTED TO KNOW WHAT CALIFORNIA'S DOING AND YOU KNOW SO I HAD A CHANCE TO KIND OF SHARE SOME OF THE IDEAS WITH THEM -- BUT ARE I THINK WE'RE ON THE RIGHT TRACK AND ALL THE DE R. THE AMOUNT OF WORK THAT WE DOING HERE I THINK REFLECTS -- ADOT ALSO I THINK I'M I'M I WANT TO THANK YOU BOTH GENTLEMEN FOR BEING HERE BECAUSE I THINK THERE IS A LOT MORE THAT WE CAN DO TOGETHER -- IDEA FROM FROM OUR POLICY ASSEMBLY AND WORKING WITH ACADEMIA ARE AS WELL AS THE INDUSTRY SO I LOOK FOR TO CONTINUING WORKING WITH YOU FOLKS ARE. AND THAT TOO HE SAID WE CAN COOPERATE WE WANT TO DO THAT SO WE THOUGHT I'D LIKE TO YASSER -- CHAIR VICE CHAIR KIND CLOSING COMMENTS. HOW THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I APPRECIATE THAT THE THE COMMENTS AND DISCUSSION AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR I? THANK YOU VERY MUCH ONCE WE HAVE QUORUM IT'S ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE WE WE I SEE MISS BAKER JOINING US SO WE WILL ESTABLISH QUORUM. SO I THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR FOR BEING A GENTLEMAN AND WE WILL.

FOR ABSENT MEMBERS SHELL AND A NOTICE THAT A SENATOR HERTZBERG IS HERE WELCOME SENATOR HERTZBERG AND YOU HAVE -- ITEM NUMBER FOUR SP ONE THOUSAND AND ONE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS APPRECIATE VERY MUCH ARMED. THIS BILL DEALS WITH THE NOTION OF BOTS. WHAT'S A BOT IN BROAD TERMS IT IS WHERE. YOU USE A COMPUTER TO FAKE. THAT YOU'RE A HUMAN BEING THAT YOUR IMPERSONATING A HUMAN BEING. AND WE HAVE SEEN THIS BOX. I HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT IN A NUMBER OF ASPECTS OF OUR SOCIETY THAT MERITS GOVERNMENT INVOLVEMENT [inaudible] WHY? WE SEEN IN ELECTIONS -- CERTAINLY BONT'S THESE THINGS THAT YOU THINK ARE PEOPLE ARE OUT THERE AND CITING IDEAS AND COMMENTS ARE. ARE CERTAINLY PEOPLE HAVE THE RIGHT UNDER THE CONSTITUTION TO SAY WHAT THEY WANT BUT THE NOTION IS TO MANIPULATE ELECTIONS WE SAW ON PARK LAND. IN THE FIRSTCOUPLE OF HOURS AFTER THE SHOOTING A SERIES OF BOTS -- INCITING -- MESSAGING ON BOTH SIDES OFTEN NOT JUST FOR POLITICAL REASONS BUT FOR ECONOMIC GAIN I KNOW THROUGH MY RELATIONSHIPS THAT THE A NUMBER OF INTERESTS IN BULGARIA. USE THIS BECAUSE THE WAY PEOPLE GET PAID IS THROUGH TRANSFERS WILL YOU WRITE IN CENTURY HEADLINES. AND THEN THAT THE YOU GET SHARES AND YOU GET PAID FOR ON THE SHARES. WE SEEN A A COMPANIES WHERE SOMEBODY GOES OUT AND WANTS TO BE A F. FANCY SH NANCY MOVIE STAR SOMETHING AND THEY GO ON HIRE A COMPANY THAT SAYS FIND ME FOLLOWERS. AND THEY FIND THE MOTHS. WE KNOW IN MY OWN POLITICAL CAMPAIGN WHEN I JUST RAN FOR OFFICE MY OPPONENTS IN A CERTAIN INDUSTRY CREATED ROBOTS. AND WE'VE SEEN THE SAME THING. IN A NUMBER ABOUT IT IN IN CERTAINLY COMPANIES TO GO TO THE PUBLIC MARKETS WHERE THEY GET VALUATIONS AND SAY WE HAVE A HUNDRED THOUSAND HUNDRED MILLION FOLLOWERS WHEN THEY REALLY DON'T. AND WE FURTHER NO FROM FOR THAT A NIGHT THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN STUDY ESTIMATES AS MANY AS 15% OF THOSE ACCOUNTS ON TWITTER AREN'T HUMAN BEINGS THEIR BOTS. WE GO SIXTY MILLION PEOPLE ON FACEBOOK THAT ARE BOTS SO SIGNIFICANT QUESTION. SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE IS TO BASICALLY TO TELL THE TRUTH BILL. TELL THE TRUTH BILL ARE YOU A HUMAN ARE YOU A COMPUTER. ARE YOU GENERATED FOR THAT PURPOSE THAT'S WHAT THIS BILLS ABOUT. NOW WHEN YOU DEAL IN THE ISSUE OF TRUTH YOU RUN INTO THE FOLLOW THE CONSTITUTION. I WOULD SUGGEST THAT WHAT WE SEEING WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO THE CREDIBLE STAFF YOU HAVE THIS COMMITTEE THAT THEY HAVE TAKEN IN THE QUE TORTURED VIEW OF THE CONSTITUTION. FROM SOMEBODY WHO HAS SPENT HIS ENTIRE LIFE IN THAT REGARD. THE TRICK THAT'S OFTEN PLAYED ON PEOPLE IS THAT YOU WRITE A DOCUMENT YOU CITE CASES AND YOU CITE CASES FOR PROPOSITIONS THAT ARE BROUGHT PROPOSITIONS THAT LOOK LIKE THEY'RE REALLY IMPORTANT CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES I WANT TO GIVE YOU A FEW. THAT WERE CITED BECAUSE I READ THE CASES. FOR EXAMPLE IN TALLY VERSUS CALIFORNIA THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES PASSED AN ORDINANCE. THAT SAID NO PERSON SHALL DISTRIBUTE ANY HAND BILL WITHOUT PUTTING THEIR NAME ON IT. THE CONSTITUTION PROTECTS PEOPLE'S RIGHT TO BE ANONYMOUS. THE FEDERALIST PAPERS IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE COMMONSENSE IN THE CONSTITUTION THERE'S A REASON WHY YOU WANT TO BE ANONYMOUS. BUT ANONYMITY ISN'T FRAUD. YOU CAN SAY WHATEVER YOU WANT IN THE CONSTITUTION. YOU CAN IS LAWS NOT YELLING FIRE IN A CROWDED THEATER BUT YOU COULD NOT COMMIT FRAUD WE HAVE IN THIS STE AND AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILLS ABOUT FRAUD BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE SECTION. SEVENTEEN FIVE HUNDRED WHICH IS REFERENCED HERE TALKS ABOUT ACT ACTIONS WHICH ARE UNTRUE WERE MISLEADING. THE CONSTITUTIONAL LAWS YOU TO MAKE UP EXAGGERATE TWEET IF YOU'RE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. BUT THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT THAT. THIS BILL ISN'T SAYS THAT I'M THOMAS PAINE OR I'M ALEXANDER HAMILTON THIS BILL SAYS THAT I'M A COMPANY IN BULGARIA THAT'S TRYING TO INCITE ACTIVITY. AND ALL WE'RE SAYING IS IF YOU'RE A BOT WE'RE TRYING TO CREATE A PROCESS WHEREBY WE'RE DEALING WITH THIS THING IN A THOUGHTFUL INTELLIGENT MANNER. THAT'S SOMETHING HAPPENS IN THIS LEGISLATIVE BUILDING THAT I FIND EXTRAORDINARILY FRUSTRATING. THE INTEREST GROUPS THAT ARE NARROW MINDED IN THEIR OWN LITTLE WAYS TRY TO ENGAGE IN BEHAVIOR BUT WE SEEN HERE IN THIS BILL. IS THE MERGER OF THE LEFT AND THE RIGHT. THE CONSERVATIVES WHO WANT BUSINESS AS USUAL AND DON'T UPSET MY BUSINESS AND THE CONSTITUTIONALIST TO TAKE A TORTURED VIEW IN ADDITION I HAVE ALL THE OTHER CASES THE MCINTYRE CASE. AND THE TURNER BROADCASTING CASE AND THERE ARE A V. CASE WHICH WAS A ST PAUL'S CASE THAT DEALT WITH INCENDIARY LANGUAGE IN SAINT PAUL WHICH IS NOT WHAT I'M DEALING WITH IN THIS BILL. THIS IS ABOUT TELLING THE TRUTH AND USING THE COMPUTERS TO MANIPULATE PEOPLE'S LIVES. NOW BECAUSE OF THE POLITICS OF THIS BILL THEY HAVE AGREED TO TAKE THESE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE NOT HAPPY ABOUT BUT I WANT. TO COOK THE INCREMENTALLY MOVE THE STRIKE SECTION SEVENTY NINE FORTY TWO FROM THE BILL WHICH IS. GUTS IT PRETTY DRAMATICALLY BUT I WILL BE BACK. I AM PERSON OF GREAT -- RESILIENCE AND I WILL PUSH THROUGH AND DEAL WITH WHAT I'VE GOT TO DEAL WITH BUT I WANT TO KEEP THE RECORD CLEAR AND STRAIGHT ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED HERE AND WHY. AND THAT YOU KNOW WHEN WHEN I THINK THAT IS MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ARE AFFECTED BY THESE IMPERSONATIONS THERE'S GOING TO BE MORE EFFORT TO MOVE THE BALL FORWARD IN WHAT HAPPENS IN GOVERNMENT. WHICH IS QUITE CHALLENGING FOR ME IS THAT WE WE DON'T GET TO THINK THROUGH THE FUTURE WE RESPOND TO WHAT HAPPENS AND SO THERE WILL BE MORE CONTROVERSIES THERE WILL BE MORE ARE URGENCY IS THERE WILL BE MORE -- SCANDALS THAT WILL RESULT IN WHY WE DON'T DO THIS BUT AT LEAST AS A BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT. WE WILL HAVE IN MY VIEW MOVE THE BALL BY BEGINNING TO IDENTIFY THIS INSTEAD OF CUTTING AND RUNNING AT LEAST GETTING IN THE GAME SUCKS UP THE MEASUREMENTS WE'RE TRYING TO DEAL WITH THE ISSUE WHERE PEOPLE PHONY BALONEY AT UP. AND LARGE POINT HERE IS TO IT WHICH YOU HAVE THE MOST ROBUST CONSTITUTIONAL DISCUSSION BUT NOT IN A WAY WHERE THE THE THESE THESE ARGUMENTS ARE MADE ON BOTH SIDES ONE SIDE WANTING. TO DE SAY YOU GOT A BILL AND AND AND AND AND WE DID SOMETHING ABOUT IT WHEN NOTHING'S DONE. AND THE OTHER SIDE AN OVERZEALOUS READING OF THE CONSTITUTION IN MY JUDGMENT WITH THAT. I TURNED OVER TO COMMONSENSE IS THE SPONSOR OF THIS MEASURE. THANK YOU MEMBERS MY NAME SEAN PRESTON I'M HERE REPRESENTING COMMON SENSE MEDIA BUT I'M ALSO HERE BECAUSE I WAS FORMERLY THE DIRECTOR OF COMMUNICATIONS FOR THE CALIFORNIA JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND I WANT TO TAKE ONE MOMENT. AND REMIND EVERYBODY OF THE PROFOUND NATIONAL SECURITY AMMAN FORSMAN IMPLICATIONS OF THIS BILL. JUST LOOKING AT SOME OF THE REPORTS WE'VE SEEN IN THE LAST MONTH ON MAY TWENTY FIRST UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA RESEARCHER PUT OUT A STUDY FINDING THAT BREXIT. AND THE TWENTY SIXTEEN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS COULD WELL STATISTICALLY HAVE BEEN TIPPED BY THE MESSAGES PUMPED OUT BY ILLEGAL BOTS. ON JUNE TWELFTH OF THIS YEAR ROBERT MUELLER WHO HAS ALREADY INDICTED THIRTEEN RUSSIANS FOR THEIR INTERFERING IN THE AMERICAN ELECTIONS -- PUT FILING INTO THE FEDERAL COURT IN WHICH HE SAID THAT THESE ELECTION INTERFERENCE EFFORTS CONTINUE WE DON'T KNOW HOW WE DON'T KNOW. HOW MUCH -- IN THIS CONTEXT WHERE OUR DEMOCRACY ITSELF AND WHERE ELECTIONS ARE SELF ARE BEING UNDERMINED IT IS WE WOULD NORMALLY TURN TO WASHINGTON DC TO FIX THAT BUT THERE IS NO RATIONAL MIND IN THIS COUNTRY THAT BELIEVES THAT DONALD TRUMP IS GOING. TO TURN ON THE BILLS THAT HELPED GET HIM ELECTED. AND SO FOR THE SECURITY OF OUR DEMOCRACY AND MORE IMPORTANTLY FOR VOTERS TO HAVE FAITH AND CONFIDENCE THAT OUR DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM IS STRONG. I ASK THAT WE FIND A SOLUTION ON THIS BILL THIS IS AN URGENT ISSUE I BELIEVE MOST AMERICANS MOST CALIFORNIANS WISH THAT THEY KNEW IF THEY WERE TALKING TO A BUY OR NOT. ONE FINAL POINT IN THE TWENTY SIXTEEN ELECTIONS. A HUNDRED TWENTY SIX MILLION AMERICANS WERE EXPOSED TO RUSSIAN PROPAGANDA ON FACEBOOK FACEBOOK HAS TOLD US THAT. WE CAN ONLY GUESS WAS WHAT TWELVE OR THIRTEEN MILLION CALIFORNIANS WE DON'T EVEN KNOW THIS IS AN URGENT ISSUE FOR US TO CONSIDER THANK. THANKS VERY MUCH NEXT WHEN AS WE SPEAK. ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL PLEASE HOW COME FORWARD. SEEING THEN OPPOSITION WELCOME. DEAR CHAIRMAN SHALL AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- AS YOU HEARD BEFORE MY NAME IS JEREMY GLOW LA I'M TECH POLICY DIRECTOR AT THE ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION. TOP FIRST AND FOREMOST WE APPRECIATE AUTHORS WILLINGNESS TO LISTEN TO OUR CONCERNS ABOUT THE IMPACTS SB ONE THOUSAND ONE AND AS IT WAS BEFORE THE AMENDMENTS WOULD HAVE HAD ON FREE SPEECH -- CAUSING PEOPLE SPEECH BE TAKEN OFFLINE AND CREATING AN INCENTIVE FOR PEOPLE -- TO BASICALLY TARGET THEIR ENEMIES ONLINE BY LABELING THEM AS POTS -- SO WE APPRECIATE THE REMOVAL OF THE USER REPORTING TAKE DOWN IN LABELING REGIME AND THE NARROWING OF THE SCOPE TO THE PRECISE HARMS AS OPPOSED TO ALL BOTS -- WE DO STILL HAVE SOME CONCERNS FOR EXAMPLE THE INTENT LANGUAGE IN THE AMENDMENTS REMAINS A LITTLE BIT CONFUSING TO US -- WE ALSO THINK THE DEFINITION OF POT COULD BE TIGHTENED UP -- HOWEVER THE THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AND THE REMOVAL OF SECTION SEVENTY NINE FORTY TO DO GET YOU FF ABOUT. 90% OF THE WAY TO NEUTRAL -- AND WE WERE ME AND SO WE REMAIN OPPOSED UNTIL ALL THE DETAILS ARE WORKED OUT BUT WE DO LOOK FORWARD TO WORK CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR. TO ACTUALLY MAKE THIS A STRONG BILL THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU MUCH NEXT WHEN HIS PLACE. THANK CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TODAY MY NAME'S KEVIN KINLEY ON THE TRACTOR. OF CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR AFFAIRS FOR INTERNET ASSOCIATION -- I THINK SENATOR HERTZBERG FIRST BILL IN THE PROCESS AND KEEPING AN OPEN DOOR FOR US TO EXPRESS OUR ISSUES IN TERMS OF THE BILL. THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS -- ONGOING PLATFORMS ROUTINELY FORCE COMMITTEE STANDARDS TO SOMETHING THAT WE TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY HAS BEEN TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF RESOURCES TO MAKE SURE THAT IT GETS DONE BETTER AND BETTER EVERYDAY -- AND THE SENATOR HERTZBERG. OUTLINED IN HIS OPENING. THAT THIS IS REALLY ABOUT TELLING THE TRUTH AND PEOPLE NOT CARING A FRAUDULENT ACTS. ON THE INTERNET AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY WE THINK THE AMENDMENTS. FOCUS ON THIS ISSUE WELL -- SO WITH THE AMENDMENTS AND ELIMINATING THE SAME SECTION SEVENTY NINE FORTY TWO WE LOOK FORWARD -- TO IRKS ME MOVE TO A NEUTRAL POSITION AND IT THIS COUPLE TECHNICAL TWEAKS BUT BOTH JUST THAT WASN'T HERTZBERG. SO WILL BE NEUTRAL NOW. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL PLEASE COME FORWARD. FELLER INNER FOR THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WE ARE STILL IN IN OPPOSITION. WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE AMENDMENTS FIRST. THANK YOU MUCH [inaudible] ANYONE ELSE. SEEING NONE LET'S BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE KYLE QUESTION COMMENTS MISTER OBERNOLTE GUIDE. I THINK IT WAS CHAIR US SENATOR I AM ACTUALLY REALLY SUPPORTIVE OF WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO HERE I THINK IT'S AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TOPIC THINGS UP BUT I HAVE SOME BIG CONCERNS ABOUT THE WAY THAT YOU'VE WORKED AT THE BILL. AND AND I'LL JUST GIVE YOU A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES BUT BASICALLY MY CONCERN CENTER AROUND. THE WAY THAT THIS BILL WOULD LIMIT. THE APPLICATIONS OF TECHNOLOGY -- TO HUMAN PRODUCTIVITY AND MAKING HUMAN LIFE BETTER -- AND I DON'T WISH TO FOCUS ON THE FEELS THAT I'M FAMILIAR WITH YOU KNOW I'VE HAD A THIRTY YEAR CAREER AS A VIDEO GAME DESIGNER AND DO SO. I WILL GIVE YOU A HYPOTHETICAL SO YOU KNOW I'M PLAYING A VIDEO GAME ON MY PC. WHICH IS CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET -- I'M WALKING UP I MEAN I'M A NIGHT NOR THE GUARD RECOGNIZE ME DRAWS HIS SWORD AND AN EPIC BATTLE ENSUES. RIGHT SO THE QUESTION IS IS THAT A VIOLATION OF YOUR BILL NO. OKAY WELL I DISAGREE WITH YOU ONLY READ YOU KNOW THIS IS SECTION. NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE FORTY ONE WHICH IS NOT THE SECTION THAT YOU ARE REMOVING IN YOUR AMENDMENTS IT SAYS IT SHALL BE UNLAWFUL FOR ANY PERSON TO USE A BOX. TO COMMUNICATE OR INTERACT WITH NATURAL PERSONS IN CALIFORNIA ONLINE WITH THE INTENTION OF MISLEADING AN ACTUAL PERSON ABOUT ITS ARTIFICIAL IDENTITY CORRECT OKAY SO -- THIS IS BOUND IT'S NOT CLEAR WHETHER OR NOT THE GUARD AT THE CASTLE GATE THAT I'M INTERACTING WITH IS A POT. WHAT IS WEEK WE CALLED THE VIDEO GAME PARLANCE -- AN NPC A NON PLAYER CHARACTER WORK IS BEING CONTROLLED BY HUMANS SOMEWHERE ELSE WE HAVE TO DISCLOSE THAT TO ANYONE IT CERTAINLY INTERACTING WITH US SO I MEAN I WOULD SAY THAT'S A VIOLATION OF OUR OF THE BILL. YOU KNOW IN AND OFTEN WERE TELLING A STORY IN A VIDEO GAME THAT'S A VIDEO GAME. WHO A MISSUS UNLESS I'M JUST LIKE AND NOT A KID TO PLAY VIDEO GAMES HER? AND MASS THAT I TALK TO TOYS AND BUILDING BLOCKS IN MY DAY BUT BUT BY ITS NATURE TO VIDEO GAME YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S NOT A HUMAN BEING. IT'S NOT IT'S ARE WHAT WOULD YOU SAY YOU'RE GOING UP AGAINST THE GUARD MY KID I WATCH MY KIDS PLAY THESE GAMES AND YET THERE'S PEOPLE ON THE OTHER ENDS ARE NOT ON THE AT OTHER ENDS BUT YOU KNOW THAT YOU'RE PLAYING THE GAME VERSES. IN THE TALKS ABOUT THE IDEA OF INTENTIONAL MISREPRESENTATION WITH RICH AS AMENDED IN TERMS OF THE ISSUE. ARE ARE SO THE PURPOSE HERE IS TO INTENTIONALLY MISREPRESENT WE'RE GOING TO THE POINT THAT THAT THAT WAS ARTICULATED BY THE WITNESS AND COMMON SENSE ABOUT. THAT THE DANGERS HERE INTENTIONALLY MISREPRESENTING SO YOU'RE THAT VIDEO GAME OF THE GUARDS THERE THERE'S NO INTENTIONAL MISREPRESENTATION IN ORDER TO TRY TO CAUSE YOU TO BELIEVE THEY'RE DEALING. WITH THE U. WITH A PERSON THAT THE THE THE THE NOTION BEHIND THE BOTTOM HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU SIR TERMS OF YOUR EXPERTISE TO A LOT OF RESPECT FOR YOUR BRAIN. BUT BUT THE NOTION IS THAT THAT. WE'RE TRYING TO DEAL WITH YOU KNOW AGAIN WE DON'T STOP SPEECH DAY WHAT YOU WANT. JUST IDENTIFIED THAT EUROPE MACHINE THAT'S ALL BUT IF I'M IN MY VIDEO GAME IF IF I WALK UP TO THE GUARD AND I HAVE TO HAVE A SOMETHING FLOATING IN THE AIR ABOVE HIM THAT SAYS. YOU KNOW NOT A REAL PERSON BECAUSE IN IN IN GAMES MODERN GAMES LIKE WORLD WARCRAFT LEAGUE OF LEGENDS. IT'S NOT CLEAR WHEN YOU'RE INTERACTING WITH. AN ENTITY IN THE GAME WHETHER OR NOT IT'S A REAL PERSON OR SOMETHING THAT'S CONTROLLED BY THE A I OF THE GAMEPLAY. GIVEN THE POINT IS LIKE BUT I GUESS THE QUESTION IS A CERTAIN CHAIR IF I COULD. WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET TO IS THIS? IF YOU'VE GOT SOME IDEAS TO MAKE IT CLEAR I'M ALL FOR IT YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT GAMES IN MY THING IT WOULD LOVE TO GET YOUR INSIGHTS ON THAT HAPPY TO MAKE CHANGES IN THAT REGARD. BUT WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET TO IS TO MAKE SURE. IN THESE CONTEXTS WHAT HAVE WE SEEN WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO EVEN HIM EVEN THE MAJORITY LEADER YOUNG GUY RIGHT. THE GUY SIT NEXT TO HIM THESE GUYS IN HAVE BOTS WHEN THEY WERE KIDS DID YOU. IT WAS A DIFFERENT WE HAD VIDEO GAMES AND STUFF BUDGET THAT BOTS TODAY IT'S ALL BECOME A REALLY BIG THING. AND SO I'M JUST TRYING TO GET TO IT BY VIRTUE OF THE IMPACT IT'S HAVING ON BUSINESS SONS IT'S HAVING ON POLITICAL DISCOURSE. AND TRYING TO BASICALLY LABEL IT SO THAT BECAUSE THE YOUR INTENTIONALLY TRYING TO DECEIVE THAT'S THE POINT. AND IT TALKS ABOUT INTENTIONAL DECEPTION WE'RE AND FURIOUS AGREEMENT OKAY WELL ALL WORK WITH THE ON THIS AND AND AND LET'S MENTAL TIME A BY A LUNCH AND LET'S SEE IF WE CAN COME AYE SOME FURTHER CLARIFIED. BUT I MEAN IF MY POINT IS IF WE RELY ON COMMON SENSE TO INTERPRET THE LAW THEN A LOT OF THE LEGAL SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA WOULD BE MUCH BETTER. WE HAVE TO GO ON IS IS WHAT IS IN THE LAW AND THE WAY THAT YOU'VE WRITTEN THIS MAKES IT BROAD ENOUGH THAT. A LOT OF DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF HUMAN COMPUTER INTERACTION COULD BE IMPACTED AND I JUST RAISE ONE HAVE BEEN WE JUST OF VIDEO GAMES BUT I'M WORRIED ABOUT -- VIRTUAL REALITY AND AUGMENT FIELDS WHERE -- IS REALLY GOING TO BLUR THE LINES BETWEEN -- INTERACTING WITH REAL PEOPLE INTERACTING WITH MACHINE SO YOU READ THE PREFACE WHEN VERY SURE THAT WE THAT WE TIGHTEN DOWN. OKAY YOU KNOW THE LOOK AT IT WILL MEAN BY FIVE MISLEAD NO. I JUST ALL I CAN TELL YOU IS IT IS COMMON SENSE WHEN YOU READ THE PREFACE TO OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES THE COMMON LAW IN THE FIRST PARAGRAPH IT SAYS THE LIFE OF THE LAW. HAS NOT BEEN LOGIC IT'S BEEN EXPERIENCE EVERYTHING THAT WE DO HERE EVERY LAW THAT WE WRITE EVERY JUDGE'S INTERPRETATION IS BASED ON EXPERIENCE. IT IS ULTIMATELY REGULATION OF THE HUMAN CONDITION AND SO THAT IS IT IS ULTIMATELY COMMON SENSE AND HAVE ALWAYS HAS TO BE EVERY TIME WE WRITE A LAW. THAT'S MY VIEW. ASSEMBLY MEMBER IF I COULD JUST POINT OUT THERE IS A CARVE OUT IN THE BILL THAT THIS ONLY APPLIES TO CASES OF COMMERCIAL SALE OF PRODUCTS OR TO INFLUENCE THE VOTE IN AN ELECTION THAT SOUNDS TO ME MORE LIKE AN ENTERTAINMENT I SEE HOW YOU COULD. THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE A COMMERCIAL SALE -- WASN'T I I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH LANGUAGE ABOUT ELECTIONS I MEAN COMMERCIAL MEANT THAT THIS IS WHAT WE DO IS COMMERCIAL RIGHT ON TOP TALK ABOUT A COMMERCIAL PRODUCT. ANYWAY UNTIL ONE WELL I DON'T I DON'T HAVE LONG DEBATE YELLIN FORWARD TO OUR DISCUSSION -- I'M GONNA HAVE TO OPPOSE THE BILL TODAY BECAUSE ALL I HAVE TO JUDGE IT ON IS WHAT'S IN PRINT BUT I WOULD LOVE TO GET TO A POSITION OF SUPPORT. YEAH THAT WAS IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THAT WAS A FASCINATING EXCHANGES OF THANK YOU VERY MUCH A AND I DO INVITE ALL OF YOU TO CONTINUE WORKING TOGETHER OUT BECAUSE THIS IS AN AREA THAT WE WANT TO SPEND A LITTLE MORE TIME ON I THINK THIS IS. BUT AS YOU SAY THAT -- MIST MISTER HERTZBERG IS VERY IT'S GETTING LARITY OR OR OTHERWISE SO I DO INVITE ALL OF YOU TO GET ENGAGED -- LIVERMORE AND ON ARE THERE ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS -- FOR THE SENATOR. IT OPENS MISTER KALRA GUY. I'M JUST GONNA SAY THAT THIS IS A DIFFICULT AREA TO WADE INTO BECAUSE YEAH. I I DO AGREE THAT THERE ARE CONCERNS OWES CONSTITUTIONAL CONCERNS WHEN IT COMES TO REGULATING SOMETHING LIKE THE INTERNET FREEDOM SPEECH AND IT'S OUR JOB TO BE WORRIED ABOUT IT'S WE HAVE TO TAKE IT SERIOUSLY AND I APPRECIATE. THE COMMITTEE TAKING THE TIME TO TAKE THAT SERIOUS AND I APPRECIATE YOUR WILLINGNESS TO A SEE THE BIGGER PICTURE MOVE THE BALL MOVE THE BALL FORWARD BECAUSE I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH THAT NIGHT. I MET MY BILLS ALL THE TIME TO MOVE THE BALL FORWARD BECAUSE IT'S A IT'S WHAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO DO HERE IS TO KEEP THE CONVERSATION GOING BUT THIS IS EXTREMELY. BIG ISSUE WHEN IT COMES TO OUR ONLINE OF WHAT PEOPLE ARE EXPERIENCING I MEAN NOT JUST WHAT YOU TALKED ABOUT THE INCITING OF CERTAIN SPECIFIC GROUPS. PUSHING THEM INFORMATION TO GET THEM TO BELIEVE SOMETHING THAT ISN'T THE CASE AND WE ARE THERE A LOT OF REAL WORLD APPLICATIONS A LOT OF DAMAGE TO BE THAT IS BEING DONE. OBVIOUSLY TO POLITICAL AND CIVIL DISCOURSE BUT THEN ALSO TO OUR KIDS AND WHAT THEY'RE BEING EXPERIENCE TO AN EXPOSED TO SO I THINK THAT'S THE BROADER PICTURE SO I THINK THAT YOU DID. YOU'VE DONE THE RIGHT THING TODAY ABOUT US AT THE SAME TIME IT'S ALWAYS AND IT'S ALWAYS EASIER TO NOWWAITING TO CONVERSATION LIKE THIS BECAUSE IT'S COMPLICATED AND CONVOLUTED EVERYBODY'S GONNA BE UPSET. BUT IT SO YOU GOT TO START SOMEWHERE AND YOU GOT HAVE SOME TYPES. OF OF STARTING POINTS I THINK THAT CRUCIATE THE OPPOSITION CONTINUING TO TAKE TIME TO WORK WITH SENATOR BECAUSE I KNOW HIM TO BE A VERY. HONORABLE AND REASONABLE PERSON AND I I'M GONNA BE VOTING TODAY AND I RESPECTFULLY MOVE BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF MISTER ABRAM LATER.

ACTUALLY DIFFER FROM MY FOR MY COLLEAGUE OVER THERE I'M I'M MORE CONCERNED ABOUT THE REGULATION OF POLITICAL SPEECH ON HIM ABOUT THE REGULATION A COMMERCIAL SPEECH AND SO -- I APPRECIATE YOU STARTING THIS CONVERSATION TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY BECAUSE I THINK IT SUPPORT TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION BUT I WOULD LIKE TO TALK WITH YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT IN DETAIL TO THINK ABOUT THIS BECAUSE AFTER BY LUNCH. TO ABSOLUTELY. I I JUST I I'D INVITE IF NOTHING YEAH.
