OKAY YOU CAN READ ANYTHING NO. I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE WILLING TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS ON ON HERE ABSOLUTELY SO- GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS I DON'T KNOW HOW TO MODULATE TO THIS MASK AND I ALSO DON'T KNOW HOW TO KEEP MY- SIS FROM BEING STILL LEARNING ALL. SO SB ONE ONE ONE FIVE IS A RE INTRODUCTION. TO MY SB TWO OH TWO FROM LAST YEAR WHICH IS COMMITTEE SUPPORTED. BY CLUSTERS BILL SB ONE ONE ONE FIVE ALLOWS FOR THE COMMERCIAL LICENSURE OF COMMUNITY BLOOD BANKS MANY PEOPLE WOULD BE ALLOWED. TO VOLUNTEER THEIR CANINES TO GIVE BLOOD. CURRENTLY CANINE BLOOD DONATION OCCURS TOO CLOSE TO CALL ANY COMMERCIAL BLOOD BANKS FOR CANINES MUST BE KEPT PERSONALLY ON THE PREMISES CONTINUOUSLY DONATING BLOOD FOR A PERIOD OF THEIR LIVES. IT'S BEEN MUCH CONTROVERSY SURROUNDING THE- CAPTIVE CANINE IN A COMMUNITY BLOOD DONATION PROGRAM WILL ALLOW FOR DONOR CAN IT IS TO GO HOME. WITH THEIR OWNERS. VETERINARIANS SO FACING SAID FORTY TO CANDLE. MANY EXISTING BLOOD BANKS SIMPLY ARE PROVIDING ENOUGH FOR THEIR PRACTICES. PERSISTENT DAYDREAM THE LIGHTS OF ANNA WHO NEED BLOOD TRACK SHINS AN EMERGENCY SITUATIONS. IN WHICH RESULT IN MANY PREVENTABLE DEATHS THIS. IDEA CAME TO ME FROM THE SOMEBODY BROUGHT AND BLACK WHO'S VERY PROM IN THIS COMMUNITY AND HER BELOVED WINCED IN DIED BECAUSE ATHER VETERINARIAN HERE. IN SACRAMENTO DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH BLOOD HAD TO CALL ALL OVER THE REGION. BLOOD IN IS RIVAS ONCE IN PASSED ON THE DRIVE FROM SACRAMENTO TO DAVIS SO COMMUNITY BLOOD BANKS FOR CRACK CANINES WOULD OPERATE UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A LICENSED VETERINARIAN AND WOULD WORK JUST THE WAY PEOPLE DONATE BLOOD GO AND DONATE BLOOD AND THEN GO BACK HOME. SURPRISINGLY THIS IS A LEGAL FOR ANIMALS IN CALIFORNIA EVEN THOUGH ALL FORTY NINE OTHER STATES ALLOW FOR IT. AS MENTIONED EARLIER THIS AND REINTRODUCTION OF SB TWO OH TWO WHICH WAS VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR BECAUSE HE DIDN'T BECAUSE IT DID NOT COME IN EIGHT DAYS FOR CLOSURE OF THE POST. THIS BILL CONTAINS THIRTY OUT USING BLOOD SUPPLY. IS A METRIC FOR COMMUNITY BLOOD BANKS TO MEET BEFORE THE PHASE OUT TRIGGERS FOR CLOSE COUNTY BLOOD BANKS. BUT ALSO LIKE TO ACCEPT AS MENTIONED EARLIER ALL OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS HIS PROPOSED ON PAGE SIX DENOUNCED. THE PERSON. VIEWS TWENTY EIGHTEEN TWENTY NINETEEN AMOUNT OF BLOOD PRODUCED BY CLOSE COUNTY BLOOD BANKS. AS THE MATE. METRIC FOR COMMUNITY BLOOD BANKS TO ME BEFORE THE PHASE OUT HIS TRIGGER FOR THE CLOSING FOR THE CLOSE CALL IN THE BLOOD BANKS. ONCE THIS METRIC IS MET THE SECOND IT'S A THREE YEAR PHASE OUT FOR THE CLOSE CALL ANY BLOOD. DO I. TRANSITION OPERATION. JUST TO BE CLEAR THIS CHANGE WILL NOT HAPPEN OVERNIGHT IT WILL TAKE SOMETIME FOR COMMUNITY BLOOD BANKS TO. THE SAME IN BLOCK AS WE PRODUCED BY THE CLOSE COLONY. WITH THE ACCEPTED A- GIVE ME THIS BILL. THAT THE DOUBT CLOSE. PRODUCE AN EQUAL OF BLOOD PHASE OUT HIS TRIGGERED WE ARE CONFIDENT THE WILL LEAD AN OVERALL INCREASE IN BLOOD SUPPLY HIS MORE BEEN ARIENS OEN COMMUNITY SOURCE TO BLOOD BANKS.

SENATORS GOOD AFTERNOON AND MADAM CHAIR I COMING TO ON YOUR ON YOUR MASK AT THE PHILIP KAPLEAU RIGHT. THANK YOU YOU'RE WELCOME SO FOR THE PAST FOURTEEN YEARS I HAVE SERVED AS THE MEDICAL DIRECTOR OF THE UC DAVIS VETERINARY BLOOD BACK WHE WE STARTED OUR PROGRAM OUR GOAL IS CREATE A MODEL COMMUNITY BASED CANINE BLOOD DONOR PROGRAM AND TO DEVELOP BEST PRACTICES FOR COMMUNITY BASED BLOOD BANKS IN CALIFORNIA. SENATE STARTED OUR PROGRAM WE HAVE COLECTED FROM OVER EIGHT HUNDRED DOGS ON BY MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY AND HAVE ADMINISTERED OVER SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED LIFESAVING CANINE BLOOD PRODUCTS. WITH AN AVERAGE NORTH THE SIX HUNDRED CANINE BLOOD COLLECTION APPOINTMENTS A YEAR. I'M PROUD TO SAY THAT WE HAVE NEVER HAD A BLOOD BORNE INFECTION. THESE TRANSMISSION. OR AN ADVERSE EVENT THAT WOULD HAVE PLAYED A DONOR OR A BLOOD RECIPIENT. IN DANGER. US OF OUR PROGRAM IS PROOF THAT COMMUNITY BASED BLOOD DONOR PROGRAMS CAN PROVIDE A STATE RELIABLE AND CONSISTENT BLOOD SUPPLY IN CALIFORNIA. THESE ARE INDEED. TIMES IN DEMAND FOR CANINE BLOOD GROWS DAILY AND IN TIMES OF CRISIS SUCH AS WHAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING WITH COLBERT NINETEEN THAT DEMAND IS MAGNIFIED. BECAUSE OF THE LAW ARE UC DAVIS THREE BLOOD BANK CANNOT LEGALLY PROVIDE OUR EXCESS BLOOD TO CALIFORNIA VETERINARIANS AND AS A RESULT WE ARE FORCED TO THROW AWAY MANY POTENTIALLY LIFE SAVING UNITS OF BLOOD. THE TRACK. THE HARD TRUTH THAT ANIMAL LIVES WILL BE LOST DUE TO A LACK OF BLOOD PRODUCTS FOR TRANSFUSIONS UNLESS WE DO SOMETHING TO CHANGE THE EQUATION. UNFORTUNATELY VETERINARIANS IN CALIFORNIA CAN ONLY LEGALLY PURCHASE BLOOD FROM ONE OF TO CLOSE COUNTY BLOOD. AND BLOOD BANKS ARE UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO FIRST PROVIDE BLOOD FOR CALIFORNIA VETERINARIAN AND CAN FREELY SELL THEIR BLOOD ACROSS THE COUNTRY. PUT SIMPLY THIS INEQUITY PUT IT CAN. CALIFORNIA ELEVEN FIFTY CRUCIAL IF WE'RE GOING TO CORRECT THIS INJUSTICE.
