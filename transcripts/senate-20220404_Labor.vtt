MOST FOSSIL FUEL COMPANIES ARE

01:20:45.941 --> 01:20:47.909

01:20:53.882 --> 01:20:56.251

GOOD INTENDED BILLS- AND I'M

02:10:06.698 --> 02:10:08.867
BEING TO EXPRESS MY CONCERNS

02:10:08.934 --> 02:10:11.537
THAT I HAVE RIGHT NOW WHICH HAVE

02:10:11.603 --> 02:10:13.238
. I ALWAYS TRY TO BE VERY FAIR

02:10:13.305 --> 02:10:15.274
BALANCED AND WHEN I THINK ABOUT-

02:10:15.340 --> 02:10:18.143
BILLS AND I TRIED TO REALLY

02:10:18.210 --> 02:10:20.145
THINK THROUGH THE UNINTENDED

02:10:20.212 --> 02:10:22.981
CONSEQUENCES THAT COME FROM. AT

02:10:23.048 --> 02:10:25.484
WHAT IT CALLED WARM HEARTED AND

02:10:25.551 --> 02:10:28.520
GOOD INTENDED BILLS SOMEONE IT

02:10:28.587 --> 02:10:30.956
JUST BEGAN BY EXPRESSING WHAT

02:10:31.023 --> 02:10:34.193
I'VE LEARNED THIS PAST YEAR-

02:10:34.259 --> 02:10:36.929
WITH REGARD TO THE OIL INDUSTRY

02:10:36.995 --> 02:10:40.532
AND- THE ENVIRONMENT. ONE I'VE

02:10:40.599 --> 02:10:42.868
LEARNED THAT- CALIFORNIA ONLY

02:10:42.935 --> 02:10:46.939
PRODUCES OF ABOUT30% OF THE OIL

02:10:47.005 --> 02:10:49.174
THAT WE UTILIZE IN THE STATE IN

02:10:49.241 --> 02:10:51.109
THAT WE IMPORT ABOUT 70% OF THE

02:10:51.176 --> 02:10:53.378
OIL WHICH AS YOU CAN IMAGINE WE

02:10:53.445 --> 02:10:55.214
IMPORTED FROM AREAS THAT DON'T

02:10:55.280 --> 02:10:57.749
HAVE THE SAME STANDARDS-

02:10:57.816 --> 02:10:58.550
ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICE THAT WE

02:10:58.617 --> 02:11:00.552
HAVE SO. LET ME JUST BEGIN BY

02:11:00.619 --> 02:11:04.656
THAT- LET ME ALSO STATE THE FACT

02:11:04.723 --> 02:11:07.693
THAT CALIFORNIA. IS THE LEADING

02:11:07.759 --> 02:11:10.028
STATE WHEN IT COMES TO

02:11:10.095 --> 02:11:11.797
ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS LABOR LAWS

02:11:11.863 --> 02:11:14.866
GENDER LAWS. AND EVERY OTHER LAW

02:11:14.933 --> 02:11:16.868
YOU CAN THINK OF CALIFORNIANS

02:11:16.935 --> 02:11:20.539
LEADS THE WAY SO IF WE'RE GOING

02:11:20.606 --> 02:11:22.774
TO TALK ABOUT ENVIRONMENTALLY

02:11:22.841 --> 02:11:28.413
RESPONSIBLE- AT MARKET

02:11:28.480 --> 02:11:30.549
EVERYWHERE WE CAN PRODUCE

02:11:30.616 --> 02:11:33.185
MANUFACTURE DISTRIBUTE. OIL IT

02:11:33.252 --> 02:11:35.854
WOULD BE US SO I'M A LITTLE BIT

02:11:35.921 --> 02:11:37.389
QUITE FRANKLY DISTURBING THE

02:11:37.456 --> 02:11:39.024
FACT THAT WE WOULD TRUST OTHER

02:11:39.091 --> 02:11:41.560
COUNTRIES TO PRODUCE THE OIL

02:11:41.627 --> 02:11:45.998
THAT WE UTILIZE IN CALIFORNIA-

02:11:46.064 --> 02:11:46.832
THEY DON'T HAVE THE SAME

02:11:46.898 --> 02:11:49.568
STANDARDS THAT WE DO AND BY.

02:11:49.635 --> 02:11:51.603
BASICALLY CLOSING OUR EYES AND

02:11:51.670 --> 02:11:53.372
SAYING OKAY AS LONG AS WE DON'T

02:11:53.438 --> 02:11:55.507
SEE HOW THEY DO THAT THINGS WERE

02:11:55.574 --> 02:11:57.509
GOING TO TAKE THEIR OIL I THINK

02:11:57.576 --> 02:11:59.544
WE HAVE A PROBLEM. SO THAT'S

02:11:59.611 --> 02:12:00.279
NUMBER TWO NUMBER THREE THE

02:12:00.345 --> 02:12:02.114
OTHER CONCERN THAT I HAVE WITH

02:12:02.180 --> 02:12:04.950
THIS WITH THIS BILL- BUYS THAT

02:12:05.017 --> 02:12:07.753
DIVESTMENT OF IT IS THAT THE

02:12:07.819 --> 02:12:09.621
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE OF

02:12:09.688 --> 02:12:13.392
CURBING INNOVATION- TOWARDS LOW

02:12:13.458 --> 02:12:15.260
IN ZERO EMISSION TECHNOLOGY

02:12:15.327 --> 02:12:16.595
BECAUSE MANY OF THESE COMPANIES

02:12:16.662 --> 02:12:19.231
ARE ALSO TRYING TO- ARE HAVE

02:12:19.298 --> 02:12:21.933
SHOWN AN EFFORT. IN TRYING TO

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:24.636
LEAD THE- BASICALLY THE EFFORT

02:12:24.703 --> 02:12:26.705
OF TRYING TO FIND NEW WAYS OF

02:12:26.772 --> 02:12:30.542
UTILIZING TECHNOLOGY- THAT IS

02:12:30.609 --> 02:12:32.744
ZERO AND LOW EMISSION. NUMBER

02:12:32.811 --> 02:12:35.981
FOUR- SOMETHING THAT I HEARD I

02:12:36.048 --> 02:12:39.151
HEARD TODAY AND THAT'S THE- THE

02:12:39.217 --> 02:12:42.154
UNINTENDED. THE CIVILIZATION OF

02:12:42.220 --> 02:12:44.423
THE LOCAL WORKFORCE THAT WHAT

02:12:44.489 --> 02:12:48.226
HAPPENED- WITH THE DIVESTMENT-

02:12:48.293 --> 02:12:51.363
THAT WOULD OCCUR- WITH REGARDS

02:12:51.430 --> 02:12:52.931
TO OUR LOCAL MARKETS BECAUSE WE

02:12:52.998 --> 02:12:54.499
STILL HAVE THAT 30% OF THAT

02:12:54.566 --> 02:12:56.134
WORLD IT'S BEING MANUFACTURED

02:12:56.201 --> 02:12:57.502
MOVES TO REACH YOUR LOCALLYSO

02:12:57.569 --> 02:12:59.071
THAT'S ANOTHER CONCERN THAT I

02:12:59.137 --> 02:13:03.175
WOULD HAVE. IN THE AREA- SO. I

02:13:03.241 --> 02:13:04.643
AM ONCE AGAIN GOING BACK TO

02:13:04.710 --> 02:13:06.244
CALIFORNIA BEING THE LEADER IN

02:13:06.311 --> 02:13:08.080
ENVIRONMENTAL LABOR GENDER IN

02:13:08.146 --> 02:13:11.016
EVERY SINGLE OTHER- FIELD WHEN

02:13:11.083 --> 02:13:13.352
IT COMES TO LAWS WE HAVE IT

02:13:13.418 --> 02:13:15.954
HERE. SO IF I WOULD TRUST IN AND

02:13:16.021 --> 02:13:17.689
I'M NOT SURE WHETHER OR NOT THE

02:13:17.756 --> 02:13:18.623
BILL ADDRESSES THAT I WAS TRYING

02:13:18.690 --> 02:13:20.759
TO REACH HERE IN THE NIGHT THE

02:13:20.826 --> 02:13:21.793
ANALYSIS AND I COULDN'T FIND IT

02:13:21.860 --> 02:13:24.329
SO. I'M NOT SURE IF I OVERLOOKED

02:13:24.396 --> 02:13:25.497
IT BUT IT DIDN'T SPECIFY WHETHER

02:13:25.564 --> 02:13:27.065
OR NOT YOU WERE REFERRING TO

02:13:27.132 --> 02:13:28.433
DIVESTMENT OF OIL COMPANIES HERE

02:13:28.500 --> 02:13:31.136
IN THE U. S. AND- INTERNATIONAL

02:13:31.203 --> 02:13:32.637
COMPANIES OR IS IT JUST

02:13:32.704 --> 02:13:34.072
INTERNATIONAL COMPANIES THAT YOU

02:13:34.139 --> 02:13:37.075
WANT TO DIVEST FROM- SO THAT'S-

02:13:37.142 --> 02:13:39.010
I'M NOT SURE IF YOU OUT INTO THE

02:13:39.077 --> 02:13:40.512
CHAIR AT THE TIME. WHEN YOU KNOW

02:13:40.579 --> 02:13:42.481
WHEN THE TIME COMES I WOULD LOVE

02:13:42.547 --> 02:13:43.648
TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT THAT WOULD

02:13:43.715 --> 02:13:46.551
BE OUT- SOMETHING THAT I MISSED

02:13:46.618 --> 02:13:49.788
HERE SOMEWHERE BUT- TO ME- THOSE

02:13:49.855 --> 02:13:51.390
ARE SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT I

02:13:51.456 --> 02:13:53.158
HAVE WITH THIS BILL- THAT I

02:13:53.225 --> 02:13:55.460
FEEL. ARE PROBABLY NOT

02:13:55.527 --> 02:13:56.728
SOMETHING. I CAN'T SUPPORT IT

02:13:56.795 --> 02:13:59.498
TODAY- AND- I HOPE THAT I'VE

02:13:59.564 --> 02:14:00.766
MADE CLEAR AS TO SOME OF THE

02:14:00.832 --> 02:14:02.934
CONCERNS THAT I HAVE WITH REGARD

02:14:03.001 --> 02:14:05.103
TO THIS BILL. THAT

02:14:05.170 --> 02:14:07.172
WHOLEHEARTEDLY WELL INTENDED.

02:14:07.239 --> 02:14:09.040
THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES I

02:14:09.107 --> 02:14:11.476
THINK IN THE LONG TERM AND

02:14:11.543 --> 02:14:14.012
CURRENTLY WITH THAT WOULD NEED

02:14:14.079 --> 02:14:16.114
TO HAVE THE PRODUCTION OF OIL-

02:14:16.181 --> 02:14:20.051
WITH REGARDS TO I SEE. NEEDY NOT

02:14:20.118 --> 02:14:23.155
OIL IN CALIFORNIA AND- CURBING

02:14:23.221 --> 02:14:25.557
THE ABILITY TO DO THAT FOR

02:14:25.624 --> 02:14:26.491
COMPANIES HERE IN CALIFORNIA

02:14:26.558 --> 02:14:28.794
WOULD BE A HUGE CONCERN SO-

02:14:28.860 --> 02:14:31.430

02:20:26.551 --> 02:20:27.852
TRYING TO GET THOSE MEASUREMENTS

02:20:27.919 --> 02:20:28.920
TOGETHER RIGHT NOW THERE ARE A

02:20:28.987 --> 02:20:30.722
LOT OF APPLES TO ORANGES

02:20:30.789 --> 02:20:31.956
COMPARISONS ARE NOT THERE'S NOT

02:20:32.023 --> 02:20:33.324
CONSISTENCY ACROSS THE INDUSTRY

02:20:33.391 --> 02:20:35.026

SCOPE TWO AND SCOPE THREE

02:20:36.194 --> 02:20:37.695
EMISSIONS. AND SO WE'RE LOOKING

02:20:37.762 --> 02:20:40.064

CONSISTENT ACROSS THE INDUSTRY

02:20:42.033 --> 02:20:44.402
SO THAT A HOLISTIC ANALYSIS CAN

02:20:44.469 --> 02:20:45.804
BE DONE TO DETERMINE HOW TO

02:20:45.870 --> 02:20:47.572
REDUCE EMISSIONS AND IN A ONE

02:20:47.639 --> 02:20:49.073
PIECE OF ACTION IS HAPPENING ON

02:20:49.140 --> 02:20:50.708
THAT IS THAT THE SEC AT THE

02:20:50.775 --> 02:20:52.177
FEDERAL LEVEL. WHEN THERE ARE

02:20:52.243 --> 02:20:54.445
TRYING TO GET THAT CONSISTENT

02:20:54.512 --> 02:20:56.014
MEASUREMENT OUT THERE NOT FOR

02:20:56.080 --> 02:20:57.615
EXAMPLE. AND I APPRECIATE THAT

02:21:56.875 --> 02:21:58.243
REASON WAS CENSORSHIP GIVEN CUT

02:21:58.309 --> 02:21:59.911
THE UKRAINE SITUATION THAT THAT.

02:21:59.978 --> 02:22:01.579
THAT CIRCUMSTANCES IN AFFECTING

02:22:01.646 --> 02:22:04.015
OUR WILL BE AT THE TIME OF

02:22:04.082 --> 02:22:05.116
SHELTERING THE THAT THE BILL

02:22:05.183 --> 02:22:06.551
PASSES. WE THINK YOU OF THE

02:22:06.618 --> 02:22:08.820
CENTER WAS TALKING ABOUT EARLIER

02:22:08.887 --> 02:22:16.427
IS THAT YOU KNOW BASED ON ON THE. ADVICE OF THIS COMMITTEE- WE

02:22:16.494 --> 02:22:18.563
AS ALLEGES- CAN I. DICTATE TO

02:22:18.630 --> 02:22:21.199
THE PENSION FUNDS- HOW DO THIS

02:22:21.266 --> 02:22:22.800
WITH WE CAN DIVE WE CAN ASK HIM

02:22:22.867 --> 02:22:24.569
TO DIVERSE ACTUALLY WE CAN

02:22:24.636 --> 02:22:26.070
DICTATE TO THEM TODAY BECAUSE-

02:22:26.137 --> 02:22:27.939
WE CAN'T TELL THEM HOW TO INVEST

02:22:28.006 --> 02:22:33.077
SO. THE AMENDMENTS CALL FOR. DO

02:22:33.144 --> 02:22:34.646
CREATE A KIND OF FORCE MAJEURE

02:22:34.712 --> 02:22:36.781
CLAUSE THAT ALLOWS YOU KNOW THE

02:22:36.848 --> 02:22:37.649
FUNDS TO SUSPEND THE

02:22:37.715 --> 02:22:40.785
REQUIREMENT- BASED ON. THEIR

02:22:40.852 --> 02:22:42.954
FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY TO

02:22:43.021 --> 02:22:46.591
REACT. UP TO IDENTIFY AND REACT

02:22:46.658 --> 02:22:49.694
TO THE TYPICAL KINDS OF-

02:22:49.761 --> 02:22:51.663
CIRCUMSTANCES THAT YOU SEE IN IN

02:22:51.729 --> 02:22:52.797
THAT KIND OF FORCE MAJEURE

02:22:52.864 --> 02:22:54.565
CLAUSE ACT OF GOD WAR

02:22:54.632 --> 02:22:56.701
UNFORESEEABLE. EVENT CREATES

02:22:56.768 --> 02:22:58.870
CONDITIONS THAT. THE IMPACT

02:22:58.937 --> 02:23:01.172
NORMAL MARKET MECHANISMS. WHAT

02:23:01.239 --> 02:23:03.241
IS SAYS IS SO INEFFECTIVE

02:23:03.308 --> 02:23:05.877
INFECTED WITH READING THROUGH IS

02:23:05.944 --> 02:23:08.680
THAT. ONCE THAT DETERMINATION

02:23:08.746 --> 02:23:10.214
HAS THEN BEEN RELAXED BY THAT

02:23:10.281 --> 02:23:11.916
SEEM MORE NOW BY THE

02:23:11.983 --> 02:23:15.753
LEGISLATURE- THEY HAVE- A ROLE%

02:23:15.820 --> 02:23:17.655
TO BE SHORT PERIOD OF TIME-

02:23:17.722 --> 02:23:19.357
CALLED OUT IN IN THE AMENDMENTS

02:23:19.424 --> 02:23:21.192
IN IN THE IN THE IN THE BILL

02:23:21.259 --> 02:23:23.328
LANGUAGE AS IT. IS IT WOULD NOW

02:23:23.394 --> 02:23:24.395
STAND- TO BEGIN REINVESTING

02:23:24.462 --> 02:23:27.031
AGAIN- HOWEVER NOTED THAT GOES

02:23:27.098 --> 02:23:28.633
BEYOND TWENTY THIRTY FIVE WHICH

02:23:28.700 --> 02:23:30.401
WAS JUST A TIED TO. A SUMMER

02:23:30.468 --> 02:23:32.103
CLIMATE GOALS AS YOU KNOW THAT

02:23:32.170 --> 02:23:33.338
BECAUSE EITHER THE GOVERNOR'S

02:23:33.404 --> 02:23:34.706
OFFICE SIX AT THE SECTOR BRANCH

02:23:34.772 --> 02:23:37.241
LEGISLATURE IS ALREADY PUT IN

02:23:37.308 --> 02:23:38.176
PLACE. AND I DON'T THINK THAT I

02:23:38.242 --> 02:23:39.410
WOULD THAT BE THE SUNSET IF

02:23:39.477 --> 02:23:41.779
YOU'D LIKE US TO MAKE SENSE BUT

02:23:41.846 --> 02:23:42.880
I I'M STILL UNCLEAR AS TO

02:23:42.947 --> 02:23:44.148
WHETHER OR NOT- THESE CONDITIONS

02:23:44.215 --> 02:23:45.950
WOULD APPLY NOW DID THIS IS A

02:23:46.017 --> 02:23:48.586
MATTER OF SEVEN ASSERTION BY THE

02:23:48.653 --> 02:23:50.388
FUNDS THEMSELVES. SO THAT THAT

02:23:50.455 --> 02:23:52.256
DEMOCRATS SUGGEST MISS. MARTINEZ

02:23:52.323 --> 02:23:53.658
WAITED YOU KNOW TO THE EXTENT

02:23:53.725 --> 02:23:55.460
THAT THERE IS A YOU KNOW A

02:23:55.526 --> 02:23:56.828
GLOBAL CONFLICT GOING ON WHICH

02:23:56.894 --> 02:23:57.895
IS HAVING A MEANINGFUL IMPACT.

02:23:57.962 --> 02:23:59.397
ON ENERGY PRICES IN THAT MARKET

02:23:59.464 --> 02:24:01.265
HE WOULD WITH THAT APPLY NOW.

02:24:01.332 --> 02:24:03.334
WITH THAT BE A GOOD BASIS FOR

02:24:03.401 --> 02:24:10.708
SUSPENDING- YOUNG. LIQUIDATION

02:24:10.775 --> 02:24:11.743
DIVESTMENT ON THE BASIS. THANK

02:24:11.809 --> 02:24:13.845
YOU CENTER I CAN'T TO THE EXACT.

02:24:13.911 --> 02:24:15.179
BUT WE ARE. SCANNING THE PORT

02:24:15.246 --> 02:24:16.781
FOR RISK ALL THE TIME WE HAVE.

02:24:16.848 --> 02:24:18.449
TO FIVE RE FACTOR THE WE ARE

02:24:18.516 --> 02:24:19.884
LOOK AT- AND OUR INVESTMENT

02:24:19.951 --> 02:24:20.918
MANAGERS ARE MAKING DECISIONS

02:24:20.985 --> 02:24:22.453
BASED ON THAT SO SOMETHING RISES

02:24:22.520 --> 02:24:24.756
TO A LEVEL THAT IT WILL HAVE A

02:24:24.822 --> 02:24:26.024
NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE FUNDS

02:24:26.090 --> 02:24:27.358
THEY DO TAKE ACTION OF THEIR

02:24:27.425 --> 02:24:27.959
INTERNAL BUSINESS AFTER THEY

02:24:28.026 --> 02:24:29.694
WORK WITH OUR EXTERNAL MANAGERS.

02:24:29.761 --> 02:24:31.129
OF EXAMPLE OF THAT IS WITH THE

02:24:31.195 --> 02:24:32.730
RUSSIAN INVASION OF UKRAINE.

02:24:32.797 --> 02:24:34.699
THAT TRIGGERED ARE RISK FACTORS

02:24:34.766 --> 02:24:36.501
RELATED TO WAR AND VIOLENCE AND

02:24:36.567 --> 02:24:37.835
SO THERE WERE ACTIONS THAT WERE

02:24:37.902 --> 02:24:39.504
TAKEN ALMOST IMMEDIATELY. FROM

02:24:39.570 --> 02:24:40.772
LATE FEBRUARY TO EARLY MARCH

02:24:40.838 --> 02:24:43.441
THAT REDUCED OUR DIRECT

02:24:43.508 --> 02:24:44.475
INVESTMENTS IN RUSSIA. I

02:24:44.542 --> 02:24:46.844
APPRECIATE THAT AND SO IT'S ON

02:24:46.911 --> 02:24:48.713
THE ON THE SECOND. AMENDMENT IT

02:24:48.780 --> 02:24:50.481
IT IT REQUIRES AN ANALYSIS

02:24:50.548 --> 02:24:52.884
METHODS OPPORTUNITIES- YOU KNOW

02:24:52.950 --> 02:24:55.019
SO AS TO MAKE A SMART TRANSITION

02:24:55.086 --> 02:24:56.554
AND ACTUALLY WITH A PARTICULAR

02:24:56.621 --> 02:24:58.656
ON ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. ABOUT

02:24:58.723 --> 02:24:59.590
FORTY BOTH RETIREMENT FUNDS AND

02:24:59.657 --> 02:25:00.825
THE NET EMPLOYMENT EARNINGS OF

02:25:00.892 --> 02:25:02.760
STATE WORKFORCE. AND SO EACH OF

02:25:02.827 --> 02:25:03.761
THESE ARE RELATIVELY NEW MEMBERS

02:25:03.828 --> 02:25:06.197
SO I WANT TO SEND STAND THEM. TO

02:25:06.264 --> 02:25:07.698
THE EXTENT THAT THIS IS NOW

02:25:07.765 --> 02:25:09.400
INCLUDED. WOULD WOULD THE

02:25:09.467 --> 02:25:13.137
CONDUCT OF THAT ANALYSIS BE A

02:25:13.204 --> 02:25:14.138
SUFFICIENT TO HOLD IN ABEYANCE.

02:25:14.205 --> 02:25:15.473
YOU KNOW DIVESTMENTS OF SUCH

02:25:15.540 --> 02:25:18.376
TIME IS AN ANALYSIS IS COMPLETED

02:25:18.443 --> 02:25:22.080
. I GUESS IF I IF YEAH IF I MEAN

02:25:22.146 --> 02:25:23.381
THIS IS A TEACHER BECAUSE-

02:25:23.448 --> 02:25:25.116
COMMITTEE. DRAFTED A MEMBER'S

02:25:25.183 --> 02:25:26.984
HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED- THAT IS PART

02:25:27.051 --> 02:25:29.287
OF A SECTION OF THE BILL THAT

02:25:29.353 --> 02:25:30.788
REQUIRES A REPORT TO COME BACK

02:25:30.855 --> 02:25:32.256
ANNUALLY TO THE LEGISLATURE

02:25:32.323 --> 02:25:35.059
WHICH WITHIN T. UP- SO TO SPEAK

02:25:35.126 --> 02:25:36.961
THOSE THOSE ISSUES SO. IT WOULD

02:25:37.028 --> 02:25:38.863
IT WOULD ALLOW THIS DEBATE TO

02:25:38.930 --> 02:25:40.331
CONTINUE ON INTO THE

02:25:40.398 --> 02:25:41.566
DELIBERATIONS AND DEBATE THAT

02:25:41.632 --> 02:25:42.834
WE'RE HEARING TODAY ON ON AN

02:25:42.900 --> 02:25:45.203
ANNUAL ASIS OF COURSE- IN IN

02:25:45.269 --> 02:25:46.637
CERTAINLY IT WOULD BRING THAT

02:25:46.704 --> 02:25:47.872
INFORMATION FORWARD TO THE

02:25:47.939 --> 02:25:49.774
LEGISLATURE WANT TO STEP IN. AND

02:25:49.841 --> 02:25:51.275
MODIFY THIS APPROACH OF

02:25:51.342 --> 02:25:53.711
WORKFORCES IS STRUGGLING WE JUST

02:25:53.778 --> 02:25:55.880
GOT THAT FROM THE FIRST ANNUAL

02:25:55.947 --> 02:25:57.748
REPORT- NET IMPLEMENTER RESERVE

02:25:57.815 --> 02:26:01.185
DROPPED OFF THE TABLE AND- THESE

02:26:01.252 --> 02:26:02.820
OTHER CIRCUM THERE'S THE

02:26:02.887 --> 02:26:05.623
TRANSITION- WHAT WE'RE GETTING

02:26:05.690 --> 02:26:06.924
FROM THE ANNUAL REPORT IS THAT

02:26:06.991 --> 02:26:07.759
OPPORTUNITIES ROUGHLY

02:26:07.825 --> 02:26:09.827
EFFECTIVELY. A REDUCE FOSSIL

02:26:09.894 --> 02:26:12.096
FUELS AND TRANSITION ARE NOT

02:26:12.163 --> 02:26:13.798
AVAILABLE IF THAT WAS IN THE

02:26:13.865 --> 02:26:15.399
REPORT THE I THINK THE IDEA IS

02:26:15.466 --> 02:26:17.068
THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD THEN.

02:26:17.135 --> 02:26:18.436
ACT BY BRINGING FORWARD A

02:26:18.503 --> 02:26:20.872
SUBSEQUENT BILL. OKAY BUT BUT

02:26:20.938 --> 02:26:22.707
BUT BUT DID NOT OF THIS WOULD

02:26:22.773 --> 02:26:24.275
WOULD SLOW DOWN OR OTHERWISE

02:26:24.342 --> 02:26:25.543
INTERFERE WITH INVESTMENT

02:26:25.610 --> 02:26:27.578
PROCESS IS CALLED UPON. NOT THE

02:26:27.645 --> 02:26:29.747
BILL NOT OTHERWISE EXCEPT FOR

02:26:29.814 --> 02:26:31.549
THE EXERCISE OF THE BOARD'S

02:26:31.616 --> 02:26:33.551
FIDUCIARY. DUTIES AND

02:26:33.618 --> 02:26:34.952
RESPONSIBILITIES SO THEY THEY

02:26:35.019 --> 02:26:36.687
HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE

02:26:36.754 --> 02:26:40.091
THAT ANALYSIS THEMSELVES- TO THE

02:26:40.158 --> 02:26:42.160
EXTENT THAT. THIS OF. COURSE

02:26:42.226 --> 02:26:43.794
MEASURE LANGUAGE EARLY IS IN

02:26:43.861 --> 02:26:46.964
EFFECT- IF HEY'RE IF THEY'RE

02:26:47.031 --> 02:26:49.000
CONTINUING ON THEIR MERRY WAY-

02:26:49.066 --> 02:26:50.735
THEY HAVE TO AT LEAST. A

02:26:50.801 --> 02:26:52.603
DISCLOSING TO CLEAR WHAT'S GOING

02:26:52.670 --> 02:26:53.604
ON THIS ANNUAL REPORT TO THE

02:26:53.671 --> 02:26:54.972
LEGISLATURE SO THE LEGISLATURE

02:26:55.039 --> 02:26:56.307
COULD CONSIDER ACTION I SAW IT

02:26:56.374 --> 02:26:58.109
SO I GUESS I MEAN. MIGHT BE

02:26:58.176 --> 02:26:59.577
CONFUSING- ASSIST WITHOUT THEIR

02:26:59.644 --> 02:27:01.546
MERRY WAY IS THE BILL'S

02:27:01.612 --> 02:27:07.418
PRESCRIBED WAY. BABY FROM WHAT I

02:27:07.485 --> 02:27:07.985
UNDERSTAND FROM TESTIMONIES.

02:27:08.052 --> 02:27:09.720
THERE THERE. CURRENT INCLUDE IS

02:27:09.787 --> 02:27:11.589
TO DO A SIR WAY OUR FIRST IF

02:27:11.656 --> 02:27:13.224
THIS PASSES TO DO IT ANOTHER WAY

02:27:13.291 --> 02:27:14.859
RIGHT AND SO THE ANALYSIS. MAKES

02:27:14.926 --> 02:27:19.597
PERMISSIVE. THERE OBSERVE

02:27:19.664 --> 02:27:20.598
ADDITION ALICE'S INACTION OR

02:27:20.665 --> 02:27:22.400
DOES IT SIMPLY. KOREANA STRIP

02:27:22.466 --> 02:27:23.701
COMBINE THESE TWO THINGS

02:27:23.768 --> 02:27:26.003
SERVICES TWO TRACKS LATER IN THE

02:27:26.070 --> 02:27:28.039
DAY WOULD THEY WOULD STILL I

02:27:28.105 --> 02:27:29.874
ASSUME- BE REQUIRED BY

02:27:29.941 --> 02:27:32.109
LEGISLATION TO DIVEST SO WHAT

02:27:32.176 --> 02:27:34.779
WHAT IS WHAT IS THE ANALYSIS TO

02:27:34.845 --> 02:27:37.615
BY WAY OF. SLOWING THAT DOWN OR

02:27:37.682 --> 02:27:40.484
NOT- THE I THINK THE BILL'S

02:27:40.551 --> 02:27:41.719
PRETTY CLEAR THAT DIVESTMENT HAS

02:27:41.786 --> 02:27:45.256
TO OCCUR BETWEEN JANUARY FIRST

02:27:45.323 --> 02:27:47.225
TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND TWENTY

02:27:47.291 --> 02:27:50.761
TWENTY SEVEN- FIRST. THOUGH I

02:27:50.828 --> 02:27:52.430
THINK THIS FIRST PART OF THE

02:27:52.496 --> 02:27:56.634
ANSWER- HOWEVER THE BILL. HAS

02:27:56.701 --> 02:28:02.039
VERY CLEAR LANGUAGE- THAT WITH

02:28:02.106 --> 02:28:04.342
DEFERENCE TOWARDS THE PENSION

02:28:04.408 --> 02:28:06.143
FUNDS OWN FIDUCIARY DUTY

02:28:06.210 --> 02:28:08.679
RESPONSIBILITY AND IN IN THE

02:28:08.746 --> 02:28:10.781
CASE OF THE LEGISLATURE HAS NO

02:28:10.848 --> 02:28:12.083
THERE'S NOTHING IN THE BILL OR

02:28:12.149 --> 02:28:15.086
FOR THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT- TO

02:28:15.152 --> 02:28:16.887
ENCROACH UPON THEIR FIDUCIARY

02:28:16.954 --> 02:28:18.489
RESPONSIBILITY SO HOW THEY

02:28:18.556 --> 02:28:21.792
INVEST. FUNDAMENTALLY COMES DOWN

02:28:21.859 --> 02:28:22.793
TO IT THEY'RE ON THE SAME DAY

02:28:22.860 --> 02:28:24.829
MISTER CHAIRS WELL TO ADD YOU

02:28:24.895 --> 02:28:25.830
KNOW SOLD ON THAT- THESE ARE

02:28:25.896 --> 02:28:26.897
YOUR AMENDMENTS NAY APPRECIATE

02:28:26.964 --> 02:28:28.566
THEM I THINK AT THE END OF THE

02:28:28.633 --> 02:28:30.401
DAY THAT OVER TWO HUNDRED

02:28:30.468 --> 02:28:31.636
THOUSAND UNION MEMBERS THAT

02:28:31.702 --> 02:28:33.404
CALLED FOR THIS DIVESTMENT BILL.

02:28:33.471 --> 02:28:35.239
ARE ALSO ASKING FOR ADDITIONAL

02:28:35.306 --> 02:28:36.907
TRANSPARENCY AS WELL I THINK

02:28:36.974 --> 02:28:39.577
THAT'S ALSO PART OF THIS- YOU

02:28:39.644 --> 02:28:41.112
KNOW FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND PART

02:28:41.178 --> 02:28:44.448
OF THIS AND I KNOW THAT- YOU

02:28:44.515 --> 02:28:46.050
KNOW. FOR SOME TIME CALPERS AND

02:28:46.117 --> 02:28:48.019
CAL STIRS HAVE RELIED ON ONE

02:28:48.085 --> 02:28:50.021
TYPE OF POLICY WHICH IS

02:28:50.087 --> 02:28:50.755
ENGAGEMENT POLICY WITH BIG OIL

02:28:50.821 --> 02:28:53.424
WHICH IS FINE. WE HAVE TO BE AT

02:28:53.491 --> 02:28:54.759
THE TABLE IF THAT'S WHAT THEY

02:28:54.825 --> 02:28:56.694
WANT TO DO THAT'S GREAT TO BE

02:28:56.761 --> 02:28:58.696
ABLE TO PUSH FORWARD. YOU KNOW

02:28:58.763 --> 02:28:59.897
AN AGENDA OF NET ZERO AT BY

02:28:59.964 --> 02:29:01.632
TWENTY FIFTY OR TWENTY THIRTY

02:29:01.699 --> 02:29:02.867
FIVE. BUT IT SHOULDN'T TAKE OFF

02:29:02.933 --> 02:29:04.135
THE TABLE DIVESTMENT AS WELL

02:29:04.201 --> 02:29:07.872
WHICH IS PROVEN TO BE- TO BE. A

02:29:07.938 --> 02:29:09.607
GOOD RETURN ON INVESTMENT FOR

02:29:09.674 --> 02:29:11.776
MEMBERS OVERALL SO THAT ANY AND

02:29:11.842 --> 02:29:12.943
AGAINST THAT SENATORS I WAS I

02:29:13.010 --> 02:29:14.412
REALLY DO APPRECIATE WHERE WERE

02:29:14.478 --> 02:29:16.013
YOU IN CENTER WE'RE TRYING TO

02:29:16.080 --> 02:29:16.947
HEAR- BUT THERE'S NOTHING

02:29:17.014 --> 02:29:18.616
PREVENTING EITHER THESE FUNDS

02:29:18.683 --> 02:29:19.850
FROM DIVESTING NOW SO WHAT WE'RE

02:29:19.917 --> 02:29:21.419
DOING IS. WE'RE GIVEN VERY CLEAR

02:29:21.485 --> 02:29:23.621
GUIDANCE THAT THAT IS IN FACT

02:29:23.688 --> 02:29:24.655
WHAT THEY'RE LEGALLY REQUIRED TO

02:29:24.722 --> 02:29:26.490
DO. AND YOU KNOW YOU KNOW YOU

02:29:26.557 --> 02:29:28.326
YOU MENTIONED- UNION MEMBERS AND

02:29:28.392 --> 02:29:29.660
AGAIN I DO APPRECIATE AND I'VE

02:29:29.727 --> 02:29:31.429
HEARD FROM LOTS OF. THAT BUT WE

02:29:31.495 --> 02:29:32.797
HAVE ALSO HEARD FROM MANY IN

02:29:32.863 --> 02:29:34.865
OPPOSITION TODAY AND I HAPPEN TO

02:29:34.932 --> 02:29:36.167
KNOW. A FAIR NUMBER OF THESE

02:29:36.233 --> 02:29:39.670
FOLKS DID YOU KNOW MANY OF WHOM

02:29:39.737 --> 02:29:41.739
WERE FOR THE BUILDING TRADES-

02:29:41.806 --> 02:29:42.106
ARE THEMSELVES.

02:29:42.173 --> 02:29:42.640
ENVIRONMENTALISTS WHO ARE

02:29:42.707 --> 02:29:44.508
THEMSELVES. FULLY COMMITTED TO

02:29:44.575 --> 02:29:45.242
DECARBONISING CALIFORNIA'S

02:29:45.309 --> 02:29:47.378
ENERGY ECONOMY. BUT IT IS THEIR

02:29:47.445 --> 02:29:48.679
VERY STRONG OPINION THAT THIS

02:29:48.746 --> 02:29:51.382
WILL HAVE A- AN ADVERSE EFFECT

02:29:51.449 --> 02:29:52.583
ON ON THEIR WORKING CONDITIONS

02:29:52.650 --> 02:29:56.821
AND SO. HOW DO WE RECONCILE THAT

02:29:56.887 --> 02:29:59.757
. BUT I WOULD SAY AGAIN- GOING

02:29:59.824 --> 02:30:01.092
BACK TO THIS BILL WHICH IS WHAT

02:30:01.158 --> 02:30:01.892
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE

02:30:01.959 --> 02:30:06.630
DIVESTMENT. YOU TO BE ABLE TO

02:30:06.697 --> 02:30:08.566
DIVEST ON THEIR OWN HOWEVER IF

02:30:08.632 --> 02:30:09.767
YOU LOOK ON THEIR WEBSITE THEY

02:30:09.834 --> 02:30:11.702
HAVE A CLEAR POLICY THAT ALREADY

02:30:11.769 --> 02:30:13.671
SET DEEMS DIVESTMENT AS A AS A

02:30:13.738 --> 02:30:15.706
RISK WHEN WE KNOW IT'S REALLY

02:30:15.773 --> 02:30:17.641
NOT THAT ALREADY DEEMS IT- IN A

02:30:17.708 --> 02:30:19.043
NEGATIVE LIGHT IN MY OPINION AND

02:30:19.110 --> 02:30:21.212
SO WHAT I'M SAYING WITH THIS IS

02:30:21.278 --> 02:30:22.713
THAT WE HAVE TO DO THIS BECAUSE

02:30:22.780 --> 02:30:24.515
ALL THEY WANTED TO DO IS ENGAGE

02:30:24.582 --> 02:30:26.450
WITH. AND SIT DOWN AT THE TABLE

02:30:26.517 --> 02:30:28.319
WITH EXAM WHICH IS FINE YOU SIT

02:30:28.386 --> 02:30:29.620
ON THE TABLE WITH EXXON MOBIL TO

02:30:29.687 --> 02:30:31.555
GET THREE MORE ENVIRONMENT

02:30:31.622 --> 02:30:32.590
ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY BOARD

02:30:32.656 --> 02:30:34.392
MEMBERS TO A TWELVE MEMBER BOARD

02:30:34.458 --> 02:30:36.427
THAT'S GREAT THAT'S NOT A QUORUM

02:30:36.494 --> 02:30:38.629
NUMBER TWO IT'S STILL NOT MOVING

02:30:38.696 --> 02:30:40.598
OF THE NEEDLE FAST ENOUGH FOR

02:30:40.664 --> 02:30:42.466
WHERE WE NEED TO GO GIVEN YOU

02:30:42.533 --> 02:30:45.269
KNOW WHERE WE ARE CURRENTLY. SO

02:30:45.336 --> 02:30:47.071
AGAIN THIS IS NOT LOOKING AT

02:30:47.138 --> 02:30:48.839
NECESSARILY THE WORK FORCE AND

02:30:48.906 --> 02:30:50.574
WHAT THIS WILL DO THIS IS SIMPLY

02:30:50.641 --> 02:30:51.609
A DIVESTMENT BILL THAT WILL LOOK

02:30:51.675 --> 02:30:54.478
AT ENSURING THAT IF WE ARE

02:30:54.545 --> 02:30:55.746
DIVESTING IN THIS MOVES FORWARD

02:30:55.813 --> 02:30:57.882
THAT THE ASSUMPTION IS THAT THE

02:30:57.948 --> 02:30:59.383
CALPERS AND STIRS BOARD WOULD

02:30:59.450 --> 02:31:01.185
THEN START SHIFTING MORE

02:31:01.252 --> 02:31:03.554
ENVIRONMENTALLY SET FRIENDLY-

02:31:03.621 --> 02:31:05.489
INVESTMENTS BUT ALSO LABOR

02:31:05.556 --> 02:31:07.057
FRIENDLY COME COMPANIES AS WELL

02:31:07.124 --> 02:31:09.160
AS- ERIN LEHANE ALLUDED TO THE

02:31:09.226 --> 02:31:12.163
ESG. RISK PORTFOLIO IS WHAT WE

02:31:12.229 --> 02:31:14.398
WANT TO OUR ESG MORE- MORE ESG

02:31:14.465 --> 02:31:15.966
INVESTMENT IS WHAT WE WANT TO BE

02:31:16.033 --> 02:31:17.902
GEARED TOWARDS NOT JUST THE

02:31:17.968 --> 02:31:19.136
ENVIRONMENTALLY SOUND BUT ALSO

02:31:19.203 --> 02:31:20.604
SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE ARE THEY

02:31:20.671 --> 02:31:23.307
PROTECTING LGBTQ EMPLOYEES DO

02:31:23.374 --> 02:31:24.442
THEY HAVE GOOD GOVERNANCE AND

02:31:24.508 --> 02:31:26.510
TRANSPARENCY CLASSES LIKE WHAT

02:31:26.577 --> 02:31:27.845
WHAT ELSE CAN WE INVEST AND

02:31:27.912 --> 02:31:29.213
THAT'S NOT JUST ENVIRONMENTALLY

02:31:29.280 --> 02:31:31.015
FRIENDLY BUT THE WHOLE PORTFOLIO

02:31:31.081 --> 02:31:32.016
OF SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE

02:31:32.082 --> 02:31:34.518

02:31:37.855 --> 02:31:39.557
THEY NEED TO GO FARTHER IN ORDER

02:31:39.623 --> 02:31:41.926
FOR US TO HIT OUR GOALS. AND

02:31:41.992 --> 02:31:44.228

CLEAR IS IT TRUE THAT IT IS YOUR

02:35:15.973 --> 02:35:17.608
ASSESSMENT THAT THIS BILL WOULD

NOT ONLY BE DETRIMENTAL TO THE

02:35:19.309 --> 02:35:20.544
RETURNS OF THE INVESTING FUNDS

02:35:20.611 --> 02:35:22.880

02:36:29.480 --> 02:36:32.850
IT IT IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE I

02:36:32.916 --> 02:36:35.519
AM A FORTY YEAR. CREDIT MEMBER

02:36:35.586 --> 02:36:39.723
IN THE PER SYSTEM AND IT IN THE

02:36:39.790 --> 02:36:41.291
NINETEEN EIGHTIES I WAS VERY

02:36:41.358 --> 02:36:43.227
ACTIVE IN THE DIVESTMENT FROM

02:36:43.293 --> 02:36:46.330
SOUTH AFRICA MOVEMENT AND THAT

02:36:46.396 --> 02:36:48.298
HAPPENED THE VOTERS OF MY TOWN

02:36:48.365 --> 02:36:50.067
WHEN I WAS MAYOR APPROVED THE

02:36:50.134 --> 02:36:51.769
DIVESTMENT BALLOT MEASURE THAT

02:36:51.835 --> 02:36:54.304
WE PUT ON THE BALLOT. INTO A LOT

02:36:54.371 --> 02:36:56.039
OF THE SAME ARGUMENTS WERE MADE

02:36:56.106 --> 02:36:58.842
WE HEARD TODAY A. N. THOSE

02:36:58.909 --> 02:37:00.611
NEGATIVE THINGS DID NOT

02:37:00.677 --> 02:37:03.413
MATERIALIZE AND I THINK IN

02:37:03.480 --> 02:37:05.983
RETROSPECT ANYBODY THAT STOOD UP

02:37:06.049 --> 02:37:09.386
ARE FOR NOT INVESTING IN SOUTH

02:37:09.453 --> 02:37:11.522
AFRICA WAS ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF

02:37:11.588 --> 02:37:13.657
HISTORY. IN A AND A LOT OF THE

02:37:13.724 --> 02:37:15.692
SAME ARGUMENTS ARE MADE THIS IS

02:37:15.759 --> 02:37:16.960
GONNA BE LOSE WE'RE GOING TO

02:37:17.027 --> 02:37:19.363
LOSE MONEY IT'S GONNA PUSH THE

02:37:19.429 --> 02:37:21.865
PENSION SYSTEMS INTO A CORNER

02:37:21.932 --> 02:37:23.967
AND IT JUST DIDN'T I THINK THE

02:37:24.034 --> 02:37:27.371
SIGNIFICANT THING IN THE DEBATE

02:37:27.437 --> 02:37:30.040
THAT WAS GOING ON. WHAT THERE

02:37:30.107 --> 02:37:30.674
FIVE YEARS TO DIVEST THERE'S ALL

02:37:30.741 --> 02:37:33.610
THE OTHER THINGS THAT CAME IN IN

02:37:33.677 --> 02:37:35.345
THE AMENDMENTS ABOUT. ACTS OF

02:37:35.412 --> 02:37:37.514
GOD AND EVERYTHING AND YOU KNOW

02:37:37.581 --> 02:37:38.982
NINE ELEVEN HAPPENED SO FOUR

02:37:39.049 --> 02:37:41.018
YEARS AND ELEVEN MONTHS AND

02:37:41.084 --> 02:37:42.986
TWENTY FIVE DAYS AND OKAY-

02:37:43.053 --> 02:37:44.354
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU WOULD

02:37:44.421 --> 02:37:45.923
HOPE THAT THOSE AMENDMENTS WOULD

02:37:45.989 --> 02:37:48.292
TAKE INTO ACCOUNT. BUT IN FIVE

02:37:48.358 --> 02:37:51.195
YEARS WITH THE PENSION SYSTEM

02:37:51.261 --> 02:37:52.830
SHOULD HAVE THE UPS THE DOWNS

02:37:52.896 --> 02:37:54.832
THE EVERYTHING TO BE ABLE TO

02:37:54.898 --> 02:37:57.201
DEAL WITH THIS IN A WAY THAT IS

02:37:57.267 --> 02:37:59.203
RESPONSIBLE TO THE FIDUCIARY

02:37:59.269 --> 02:38:01.805
INTERESTED AND TO ME THAT TIME

02:38:01.872 --> 02:38:04.274
FRAME HAS BEEN THE TIME FRAME.

02:38:04.341 --> 02:38:07.611
IS THAT THAT HAS BEEN USED IT IN

02:38:07.678 --> 02:38:10.113
OTHERS AND THE- THERE THERE BEEN

02:38:10.180 --> 02:38:11.648
A LOT OF ARGUMENTS MADE AND I

02:38:11.715 --> 02:38:13.283
THINK SOME OF THEM ARE

02:38:13.350 --> 02:38:16.186
CONFLATING THINGS BECAUSE IT'S A

02:38:16.253 --> 02:38:18.956
WHOLE ISSUE OF NOT FROM

02:38:19.022 --> 02:38:21.525
INVESTING IN FOSSIL FUEL IN

02:38:21.592 --> 02:38:24.027
THESE TIMES BUT- THE SOMEBODY

02:38:24.094 --> 02:38:25.195
THAT SUPERVISED THE OIL

02:38:25.262 --> 02:38:27.998
REGULATOR FOR EIGHT YEARS IT THE

02:38:28.065 --> 02:38:30.267
ISSUE IS RIGHT THAT WAS SAID WE

02:38:30.334 --> 02:38:31.869
IMPORT A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF

02:38:31.935 --> 02:38:34.171
OIL IN CALIFORNIA. AND I THINK

02:38:34.238 --> 02:38:37.241
THAT IS AN ARGUMENT FOR THAT IS

02:38:37.307 --> 02:38:38.976
NOT NECESSARILY RELATED TO THIS

02:38:39.042 --> 02:38:40.811
BILL BUT IT IS A VERY VALID

02:38:40.878 --> 02:38:43.180
ARGUMENT IF YOU. YOU KNOW JERRY

02:38:43.247 --> 02:38:44.848
BROWN WAS FORTHRIGHT ON THAT

02:38:44.915 --> 02:38:49.786
ISSUE THAT ARM JEEZ IF WE FORCE

02:38:49.853 --> 02:38:52.422
ADDITIONAL. IMPORTS BECAUSE WE

02:38:52.489 --> 02:38:54.658
CUT CALIFORNIA PRODUCTION AND

02:38:54.725 --> 02:38:56.326
IT'S A CHOICE BETWEEN TANKERS

02:38:56.393 --> 02:38:57.961
AND OIL TRAINS AND ALL THESE

02:38:58.028 --> 02:38:59.162
THINGS THAT AREN'T NECESSARILY

02:38:59.229 --> 02:39:02.466
SAFE HOW WAS THAT SMART PUBLIC

02:39:02.532 --> 02:39:04.568
POLICY THE REAL PUBLIC POLICY.

02:39:04.635 --> 02:39:07.170
IS ABOUT LOWERING DEMAND IT AND

02:39:07.237 --> 02:39:10.340
THAT IS WHAT. HAS BEEN DONE IN

02:39:10.407 --> 02:39:11.174
THERE ALWAYS ARGUMENTS THAT WERE

02:39:11.241 --> 02:39:13.243
MADE LIKE. THAT CALIFORNIA WAS

02:39:13.310 --> 02:39:15.145
GOING TO GOT THE AUTOMOBILE

02:39:15.212 --> 02:39:17.381
INDUSTRY BY DOING THE TAILPIPE

02:39:17.447 --> 02:39:19.783
STANDARDS AND WHAT HAPPENED.

02:39:19.850 --> 02:39:21.084
THERE WAS SO MUCH IN THE MARKET

02:39:21.151 --> 02:39:22.986
DRAINING TWO OUT OF THE COUNTRY

02:39:23.053 --> 02:39:25.055
CAR COMPANIES THAT MET WHAT THE

02:39:25.122 --> 02:39:28.692
CONSUMERS WANTED. THAT IN FACT

02:39:28.759 --> 02:39:30.994
THE GOVERNMENT HAD TO BAIL OUT

02:39:31.061 --> 02:39:33.497
OF THE U. S. AUTO COMPANIES IN

02:39:33.563 --> 02:39:35.632
TIME TO ALLOW THEM TO SHIFT TO

02:39:35.699 --> 02:39:36.733
WHERE THE PUBLIC WAS IN THE

02:39:36.800 --> 02:39:38.802
MARKET WAS AND WHEN THE- THE

02:39:38.869 --> 02:39:40.437
REGULATIONS WERE DONE

02:39:40.504 --> 02:39:43.340
NATIONALLY. VERY ALARMED AT THE

02:39:43.407 --> 02:39:44.741
OTHER FORTY NINE STATES WITH

02:39:44.808 --> 02:39:47.711
CALIFORNIA THAT WAS THE WAY THEY

02:39:47.778 --> 02:39:49.780
DEALT WITH IT AND THAT WAS. THE

02:39:49.846 --> 02:39:53.383
LOWERING DEMAND AND THAT THAT IS

02:39:53.450 --> 02:39:55.018
A LOGICAL ARGUMENT TO HAVE BUT

02:39:55.085 --> 02:39:56.420
THAT'S NOT WHAT'S CENTRAL TO

02:39:56.486 --> 02:39:58.689
THIS BILL. ON THIS BILL IS ABOUT

02:39:58.755 --> 02:40:00.757
INVESTING IN THE COMPANIES AND

02:40:00.824 --> 02:40:01.858
THE LOWERING DEMAND IS A

02:40:01.925 --> 02:40:04.328
SEPARATE ISSUE THAT I THINK WE

02:40:04.394 --> 02:40:09.900
STILL VERY MUCH HAVE TO ADDRESS.

02:40:09.967 --> 02:40:12.069
IT AND THE TOUGH THING IS THAT.

02:40:12.135 --> 02:40:14.171
I GROANED I HAVE A VERY RETAIL

02:40:14.237 --> 02:40:16.039
DISTRICT AND I MEET WITH PEOPLE

02:40:16.106 --> 02:40:18.175
ALL THE TIME AND I MEET WITH

02:40:18.241 --> 02:40:20.210
THESE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT ARE JUST

02:40:20.277 --> 02:40:21.678
. YOU KNOW THE VERSION AS YOU

02:40:21.745 --> 02:40:23.213
OLDER PEOPLE OF REALLY SCREWED

02:40:23.280 --> 02:40:24.781
THINGS UP THANKS FOR LEAVING

02:40:24.848 --> 02:40:27.050
THIS ARE WE REALLY APPRECIATE IT

02:40:27.117 --> 02:40:28.986
YOU WON'T EVEN BE HERE WHEN WE

02:40:29.052 --> 02:40:31.254
HIT THE BIGGER IMPACTS BUT- HE-

02:40:31.321 --> 02:40:34.624
YOU KNOW. HE I LIVE IN THIS

02:40:34.691 --> 02:40:36.226
PLACE WHERE WE TREASURE THE FOG

02:40:36.293 --> 02:40:38.228
IN THE SUMMER AND THE SUMMER

02:40:38.295 --> 02:40:40.664
BEFORE LAST. WE LOST NINE

02:40:40.731 --> 02:40:41.832
HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE HOMES

02:40:41.898 --> 02:40:44.134
AND PLACES THAT IT NEVER BURNED

02:40:44.201 --> 02:40:46.603
BEFORE HISTORY. AND THE WE

02:40:46.670 --> 02:40:48.271
DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES

02:40:48.338 --> 02:40:49.706
WERE CONSIDERING A BILL NATURAL

02:40:49.773 --> 02:40:51.008
RESOURCES TOMORROW MORNING WE

02:40:51.074 --> 02:40:52.442
DON'T HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES TO

02:40:52.509 --> 02:40:53.643
FIGHT THE FIRE THE FIRE WAS AT

02:40:53.710 --> 02:40:55.545
FAULT FOR THREE OR FOUR DAYS. WE

02:40:55.612 --> 02:40:57.748
JUST HAD OUR FIRE DEPARTMENT AT

02:40:57.814 --> 02:40:59.082
THE CITY LIMITS ONE BIG WIND AND

02:40:59.149 --> 02:41:00.984
IT'S AND I WAS PACKED AND READY

02:41:01.051 --> 02:41:02.953
TO GO IN THIS TEMPERATE SEASIDE

02:41:03.020 --> 02:41:04.254
TOWN. AND EVERYBODY IS ASKING

02:41:04.321 --> 02:41:07.491
WHAT ARE WE DOING HOW ARE WE

02:41:07.557 --> 02:41:09.726
GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE MAKE

02:41:09.793 --> 02:41:11.795
A STATEMENT AND WE DEAL WITH IT

02:41:11.862 --> 02:41:14.231
AND IT'S- IT IS AND- I THINK

02:41:14.297 --> 02:41:16.733
SOME OF THE CONCERNS. NOT NOT ON

02:41:16.800 --> 02:41:19.069
THE INVESTMENT BUT ON THE JOBS

02:41:19.136 --> 02:41:21.338
ARE REALLY LEGITIMATE AND IT AND

02:41:21.405 --> 02:41:24.908
IT REALLY IS HOW DO WE MAKE SURE

02:41:24.975 --> 02:41:26.777
THAT. THAT THERE ARE JOBS THAT

02:41:26.843 --> 02:41:28.678
ARE GOOD PAYING JOBS WITH

02:41:28.745 --> 02:41:30.947
PENSIONS BUT- I DON'T THINK THAT

02:41:31.014 --> 02:41:32.449
MEANS ACCOMMODATING THE CHANGING

02:41:32.516 --> 02:41:34.584
CLIMATE IN A WAY THAT. THAT IS

02:41:34.651 --> 02:41:37.087
AFFECTING US EVERY YEAR WE SAY

02:41:37.154 --> 02:41:40.090
THE FIRE SEASON IS THE WORST IN

02:41:40.157 --> 02:41:40.624
HISTORY AND NOW. ALREADY

02:41:40.690 --> 02:41:41.892
PREDICTING THIS NEXT ONE'S GOING

02:41:41.958 --> 02:41:43.927
TO BE THE WORST IN HISTORY AND-

02:41:43.994 --> 02:41:46.163
AND WE ARE SEEING THE IMPACTS OF

02:41:46.229 --> 02:41:48.065
THE CHANGING CLIMATE NOW. AND

02:41:48.131 --> 02:41:51.101
SO. IT MAKES THIS REALLY

02:41:51.168 --> 02:41:55.605
DIFFICULT. BUT I THINK THAT.

02:41:55.672 --> 02:41:56.740
THERE'S ENOUGH BILL TO THIS BILL

02:41:56.807 --> 02:41:58.942
ON THE PAST. OF THINGS LIKE

02:41:59.009 --> 02:42:00.043
SOUTH AFRICA BUT SO CHAU WE HAVE

02:42:00.110 --> 02:42:01.778
FIVE YEARS TO DEAL WITH THIS.

02:42:01.845 --> 02:42:03.313
AND WE HAVE THE AMENDMENTS THAT

02:42:03.380 --> 02:42:05.348
TAKEN TO EMERGENCY SITUATIONS

02:42:05.415 --> 02:42:09.086
AND- IT N. I SUSPECT IF I WENT

02:42:09.152 --> 02:42:11.288
DOOR TO DOOR. IN MY DISTRICT I

02:42:11.354 --> 02:42:13.490
WOULD FIND OVERWHELMING SUPPORT

02:42:13.557 --> 02:42:17.527
FOR THIS AND SO. OF EVEN KNOW I

02:42:17.594 --> 02:42:19.463
WANT TO WORK TO TRY TO

02:42:19.529 --> 02:42:20.330
ACCOMMODATE EVERYBODY THAT

02:42:20.397 --> 02:42:23.166
TESTIFIED IN THEIR WAYS WE STILL

02:42:23.233 --> 02:42:25.469
HAVE TO DO IT. ARM I'M GOING TO

02:42:25.535 --> 02:42:30.640
VOTE FOR THIS BILL. FIVE ZERO

02:42:30.707 --> 02:42:33.710
ZERO THANK YOU- I WANT TO THANK

02:42:33.777 --> 02:42:36.546
THE CHAIR. FOR GETTING INVOLVED

02:42:36.613 --> 02:42:39.282
IN THE WAY THAT IS GOING TO I

02:42:39.349 --> 02:42:41.318
THINK TAKE IS MORE IN THE

02:42:41.384 --> 02:42:43.653
DIRECTION. OF WHERE I PERSONALLY

02:42:43.720 --> 02:42:48.625
FEEL WE NEED TO GET- THE FIRST

02:42:48.692 --> 02:42:51.361
AMENDMENT I THINK IS. BECAUSE OF

02:42:51.428 --> 02:42:52.095
WHAT WE'RE GOING THROUGH WITH

02:42:52.162 --> 02:42:54.364
THE UKRAINE AND RUSSIA THAT

02:42:54.431 --> 02:42:55.966
MAKES SENSE TO PUT THAT IN MAYBE

02:42:56.032 --> 02:42:57.801
A FEW YEARS AGO WE WOULDN'T HAVE

02:42:57.868 --> 02:43:00.504
THOUGHT OF THAT BUT WE ARE IN A

02:43:00.570 --> 02:43:03.073
REAL LIFE SITUATION REAL REAL

02:43:03.140 --> 02:43:06.977
TIME IN HERE- THIS IS NOT A-

02:43:07.043 --> 02:43:09.146
GOOD GUYS VERSUS THE BAD GUYS.

02:43:09.212 --> 02:43:11.648
THIS IS. GOOD GUYS BAD GUYS ON

02:43:11.715 --> 02:43:14.384
BOTH SIDES OF THE OF THE LINER

02:43:14.451 --> 02:43:17.220
THE EQUATION HERE ANNA I THINK

02:43:17.287 --> 02:43:19.823
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. THAT

02:43:19.890 --> 02:43:21.725
EVERYONE WHO CALLED IN IN

02:43:21.791 --> 02:43:25.529
OPPOSITION IS NOT OPPOSE. TO A

02:43:25.595 --> 02:43:27.230
CLEANER ENVIRONMENT IS NOT

02:43:27.297 --> 02:43:29.933
OPPOSE IS NOT FIGHTING FOR THE

02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:31.835
JOBS BECAUSE THEY DON'T CARE

02:43:31.902 --> 02:43:33.603
ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT AND I

02:43:33.670 --> 02:43:35.605
THINK WE REALLY HAVE TO REMEMBER

02:43:35.672 --> 02:43:37.674
THAT AS WE LOOK TO FIND THESE-

02:43:37.741 --> 02:43:39.643
THE SOLUTIONS AND THE BEST WAY

02:43:39.709 --> 02:43:42.512
OF GETTING WHERE WE HAVE TO GET.

02:43:42.579 --> 02:43:44.848
OUT ONE THING- BUT IF IT WAS

02:43:44.915 --> 02:43:46.750
BROUGHT UP TODAY OR IN THE PAST

02:43:46.816 --> 02:43:49.853
IS THE AND I THINK THAT WAS A

02:43:49.920 --> 02:43:53.523
QUESTION BY- SENATOR NEWMAN IS

02:43:53.590 --> 02:43:56.459
THE IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE FOSSEL

02:43:56.526 --> 02:43:58.562
FEEL WHAT IS A FOSSIL FUELS. IF

02:43:58.628 --> 02:44:00.530
YOU'RE DOING BOTH YOU KNOW IF

02:44:00.597 --> 02:44:02.766
YOU'RE DOING BOTH PRODUCTION OF

02:44:02.832 --> 02:44:04.334
FOSSIL FUEL AND YOU'RE DOING

02:44:04.401 --> 02:44:08.338
PRODUCTION OF CLEAN CLEAN ENERGY

02:44:08.405 --> 02:44:11.474
SO I JUST WANT TO. FOR ME THESE

02:44:11.541 --> 02:44:15.845
AMENDMENTS- INDICATED THE- AN

02:44:15.912 --> 02:44:18.181
INCLUSION OF THE ISSUES THAT I

02:44:18.248 --> 02:44:22.085
CARE ABOUT. THAT WERE NOT IN THE

02:44:22.152 --> 02:44:24.955
OTHER VERSION OF. SO I WOULD

02:44:25.021 --> 02:44:28.091
LIKE TO ESPECIALLY OF THE ONE

02:44:28.158 --> 02:44:30.927
RELATED TO AND NOT CONTRIBUTING

02:44:30.994 --> 02:44:32.195
TO ECONOMIC CONDITIONS THAT

02:44:32.262 --> 02:44:34.564
WOULD DAMAGE THE RETIREMENT

02:44:34.631 --> 02:44:36.566
FUNDS OR THE EMPLOYMENT EARNINGS

02:44:36.633 --> 02:44:38.501
OF THE WORK FORCE IS SOMETHING

02:44:38.568 --> 02:44:39.636
THERE THAT I THINK IS REALLY

02:44:39.703 --> 02:44:42.606
IMPORTANT THAT. MAYBE WE COULD

02:44:42.672 --> 02:44:44.908
CONTINUE TO I HOPE WE CAN

02:44:44.975 --> 02:44:46.209

02:44:46.276 --> 02:44:50.647
OTHER ONE IS THE ADDAMS THE TIME

02:44:50.714 --> 02:44:55.151

YET YOU KNOW MAKE SURE- MOVING

02:45:04.928 --> 02:45:06.863
IN THAT DIRECTION AND NONE OF

02:45:06.930 --> 02:45:09.532
THEM ARE THIS. QUICK AND I KNOW

02:45:09.599 --> 02:45:12.168
QUICK SOUNDS TERRIBLE BECAUSE

02:45:12.235 --> 02:45:14.804
THINGS ARE HAPPENING- AS SENATOR

02:45:14.871 --> 02:45:16.306

THAT'S GOING ON BUT TO ME

02:45:20.010 --> 02:45:21.444
COMPARED TO THE OTHER ONES AND

02:45:21.511 --> 02:45:24.080

02:45:24.147 --> 02:45:25.315
AUTHOR HAS A- OF A PARTICULAR

02:45:25.382 --> 02:45:27.250
EXPLANATION AS TO WHY TWENTY

02:45:27.317 --> 02:45:28.952
TWENTY SEVEN. COMPARED TO A LOT

02:45:29.019 --> 02:45:31.388
OF THE OTHER STATES THAT WE'RE

02:45:31.454 --> 02:45:33.223
WORKING TOWARDS AS A STATE

02:45:33.290 --> 02:45:37.360

02:45:43.933 --> 02:45:46.703
URGENCY BUT WHY EXISTE. COMPARED

02:45:46.770 --> 02:45:48.238
TO THE DATES THAT WERE

02:45:48.305 --> 02:45:51.574
ADDRESSING AS A STATE- BETTER

02:45:51.641 --> 02:45:54.377

02:45:54.444 --> 02:45:56.646
BOTH OF REGARDS TO THE DATE ON

02:45:56.713 --> 02:45:58.982
BOTH OF AND THE SECOND AMENDMENT

02:45:59.049 --> 02:46:02.252
ON THE ECONOMIC IMPACT- THAT WE

02:46:02.319 --> 02:46:04.254
COULD. WORK FURTHER ON THAT

02:46:04.321 --> 02:46:06.289
FRONT BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S

02:46:06.356 --> 02:46:09.726
THE- MORE I UNDERSTAND THAT ARE

02:46:09.793 --> 02:46:13.463
CHAIR HAS BEEN WORKING ON THIS.

02:46:13.530 --> 02:46:16.499
OKAY THANK YOU- IF YOU'LL LET ME

MAKE A COUPLE. THAT IS. THAT IS

02:46:23.306 --> 02:46:26.710
NOT MAYES MEDINA SOMEBODY. WE

02:46:26.776 --> 02:46:28.645
STILL HAVE A MODERATOR THAT CAN

02:46:28.712 --> 02:46:30.480
ASK PEOPLE TO ME THAT WAS NOT ME

02:46:30.547 --> 02:46:33.049
SOMEBODY JUST SPILLED ALL THEIR

02:46:33.116 --> 02:46:34.417
DISHES ON THE TABLE FOR NOVEMBER

02:46:34.484 --> 02:46:35.885
THAT'S RIGHT IT IS I THINK IT'S

02:46:35.952 --> 02:46:38.088
WORTH NOTING HERE THAT JUST ONE

02:46:38.154 --> 02:46:38.688
LAST COMMENT THAT CENTER LATE

02:46:38.755 --> 02:46:40.623
ACTION MADE A VERY GOOD POINT

02:46:40.690 --> 02:46:42.525
WHICH IS. EITHER THE WORK WE

02:46:42.592 --> 02:46:43.560
SHOULD BE DOING THE WORK WE ARE

02:46:43.626 --> 02:46:44.761
DOING BUT THERE THAT WE SHOULD

02:46:44.828 --> 02:46:46.763
REALLY ALWAYS IS ON DEMAND ON ON

02:46:46.830 --> 02:46:47.997
SHIFTING THE DEMAND CURVE IN

02:46:48.064 --> 02:46:49.399
CALIFORNIA SO I THINK THE

02:46:49.466 --> 02:46:50.600
QUESTION OF THE S. WITH RESPECT

02:46:50.667 --> 02:46:52.836
TO THIS BILL AS ADMIRABLE AS ITS

02:46:52.902 --> 02:46:55.572
INTENT IS DOES IT DO THAT AND I

02:46:55.638 --> 02:46:57.040
THINK THE ANSWER UNFORTUNATELY

02:46:57.107 --> 02:46:59.576
ISN'T NO IT WILL NOT DO THAT IT

02:46:59.642 --> 02:47:01.144
MAY IT MAY DEGENERATE SHIFT THE

02:47:01.211 --> 02:47:03.012
SUPPLY CURVE. RIGHT BY BY

02:47:03.079 --> 02:47:05.181
CHANGING KIND OF THE YOU KNOW

02:47:05.248 --> 02:47:06.516
THE FIVE FINANCIAL POSTURE BUNCH

02:47:06.583 --> 02:47:08.351
COMPANIES WHO IN THIS INDUSTRY-

02:47:08.418 --> 02:47:09.919
THAT MIGHT ACTUALLY HAVE THE

02:47:09.986 --> 02:47:11.221
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THE

02:47:11.287 --> 02:47:13.123
COSTING CALIFORNIANS MORE

02:47:13.189 --> 02:47:15.792
BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT CHANGED THE

02:47:15.859 --> 02:47:17.060
DEMAND IN CALIFORNIA WE WILL

02:47:17.127 --> 02:47:18.895
STILL AS AS I THINK MISCELLANY

02:47:18.962 --> 02:47:20.497
MENTION WITH YOU KNOW FOR THE

02:47:20.563 --> 02:47:23.266
FORESEEABLE FUTURE- SOME. THIRTY

02:47:23.333 --> 02:47:24.401

UNTIL WE. FIGURE OUT HOW TO GIVE

02:47:34.544 --> 02:47:35.578
THEM AN ALTERNATIVE. MUCH OF

02:47:35.645 --> 02:47:37.347
THIS WON'T MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE

02:47:37.414 --> 02:47:38.748
WHEN FOR. ALTHOUGH IT WILL BE

02:47:38.815 --> 02:47:40.550

02:48:35.705 --> 02:48:38.007
REDUCTION OF GHG WHICH ACCORDING

02:48:38.074 --> 02:48:39.876

VERY DIFFICULT TO READ BUT WHAT

02:49:43.840 --> 02:49:45.408
WE HEARD FROM THE OPPOSITION I

02:49:45.475 --> 02:49:46.943
DON'T THINK I COULD DO IT TODAY

02:49:47.010 --> 02:49:48.811
WHO WAS A BRILLIANT OPPOSITION-

02:49:48.878 --> 02:49:52.148
BUT IT'S ALSO- IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME

02:49:52.215 --> 02:49:53.550
TO READ BUT THE FACT THAT WE

02:49:53.616 --> 02:49:55.818
NEED TO KEEP MOVING FORWARD. IN

02:49:55.885 --> 02:49:57.687
I JUST WANT TO CLOSE MY OWN

02:49:57.754 --> 02:50:00.423

COMMITTEE BY SAYING THE ONLY

02:50:03.526 --> 02:50:04.994
THING I'M ABSOLUTELY SURE OF

02:50:05.061 --> 02:50:06.829
THIS IS HERE TODAY IS THAT WE

02:50:06.896 --> 02:50:08.631
NEED TO GET THE BILL OUT OF

02:50:08.698 --> 02:50:09.999
COMMITTEE. SO THAT THIS ISSUE OF

02:50:10.066 --> 02:50:12.869
EFFICACY CAN CAN CAN ACHIEVE A

02:50:12.936 --> 02:50:13.970
BROADER DEBATE IN THIS

02:50:14.037 --> 02:50:15.638
LEGISLATURE SOMETIMES THAT

02:50:15.705 --> 02:50:17.273
HAPPENS AND SOMETIMES.

02:50:17.340 --> 02:50:20.143
OCCASIONALLY HERE AS EACH YEAR I

02:50:20.209 --> 02:50:22.512
FEEL THAT MY JOB IS SIMPLY

02:50:22.579 --> 02:50:24.147
SUPPORT OR OPPOSE LIKE EVERYONE

02:50:24.213 --> 02:50:27.350
ELSE IT COMES FORWARD. BASED ON

02:50:27.417 --> 02:50:30.753
MY VALUES. THERE ARE A FEW TIMES

02:50:30.820 --> 02:50:32.855
. THAT COME ALONG WORK I FEEL

02:50:32.922 --> 02:50:38.461
THAT MY JOB IS TO. MAKE SURE

02:50:38.528 --> 02:50:40.597
THAT THE BILL ADVANCES TO THE

02:50:40.663 --> 02:50:42.398
BROADER DEBATE THAT REALLY NEEDS

02:50:42.465 --> 02:50:44.734
TO HAPPEN ON THESE ISSUES- AND I

02:50:44.801 --> 02:50:46.736
THINK- EVEN IS ELAINE TALKING

02:50:46.803 --> 02:50:48.671
ABOUT THE BROADER DEBATE OF IF

02:50:48.738 --> 02:50:50.840
YOU'RE GOING TO DIVEST DO YOU

02:50:50.907 --> 02:50:52.942
AVOID THAT SLIPPERY SLOPE OR DO

02:50:53.009 --> 02:50:55.011
YOU EMBRACE THE ISSUE OF

02:50:55.078 --> 02:50:56.479
ALIGNING CALIFORNIA'S VALUES

02:50:56.546 --> 02:50:57.680
WITH THEIR PENSION INVESTMENT IS

02:50:57.747 --> 02:51:00.350
A MUCH BROADER DISCUSSION- IF

02:51:00.416 --> 02:51:01.651
THAT DISCUSSION IS GOING TO

02:51:01.718 --> 02:51:02.552
HAPPEN THIS YEAR IN THIS

02:51:02.619 --> 02:51:04.887
SESSION. WE NEED TO MOVE THIS

02:51:04.954 --> 02:51:05.622
BILL FORWARD BECAUSE IT'S

02:51:05.688 --> 02:51:06.789
OBVIOUSLY TRIGGERING THAT

02:51:06.856 --> 02:51:08.391
CONVERSATION AND I THINK THAT'S

02:51:08.458 --> 02:51:11.561
A GOOD THING- WE- IF THE BILL

02:51:11.628 --> 02:51:13.463
GETS OUT TODAY LIKELY WE WILL

02:51:13.529 --> 02:51:17.166
ALL. HAVE ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO

02:51:17.233 --> 02:51:19.168
MAKE A DECISION BASED ON OUR

02:51:19.235 --> 02:51:21.170
THIS IS OUR VALUES IN BASED ON

02:51:21.237 --> 02:51:22.538
WHAT WE THEN BELIEVE THE

02:51:22.605 --> 02:51:24.874
EFFICACY OF THE BILL AS FURTHER

02:51:24.941 --> 02:51:28.177
AMENDED IS AS FOR THE DEBATED-

02:51:28.244 --> 02:51:30.246
IN THAT'S GOING TO BE A TOUGH

02:51:30.313 --> 02:51:32.015
VOTE THIS COULD BE A TOUGH FOR

02:51:32.081 --> 02:51:34.250
B. AS WELL BUT TODAY I'M GOING

02:51:34.317 --> 02:51:34.884
TO VOTE FOR GETTING. THE BILL

02:51:34.951 --> 02:51:36.486
OUT OF COMMITTEE INCLUDED ALONG

02:51:36.552 --> 02:51:37.787
SO THAT BROADER DEBATE CAN

02:51:37.854 --> 02:51:40.490
OCCUR- THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY

02:51:40.556 --> 02:51:42.291
ANY OTHER COMMENTS OF METAL BY

02:51:42.358 --> 02:51:43.593

MAKE SURE. THAT THE CIRCLE BACK

02:51:48.498 --> 02:51:49.832
TO IN CASE THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE

02:51:49.899 --> 02:51:53.536
YOU NEED TO SAY IT IS JUST

02:51:53.603 --> 02:51:58.074
GETTING. BROWN TO OF COURSE. I

02:51:58.141 --> 02:51:59.609
JUST WANT O SORT OF JUST

02:51:59.676 --> 02:52:03.713
REITERATE THAT THE COMMENT THAT

02:52:03.780 --> 02:52:06.416
. I UNDERSTAND THE INTENT BEHIND

02:52:06.482 --> 02:52:09.619
THE BILL AND- JUST THE CONCERN

02:52:09.686 --> 02:52:11.621
THAT I HAVE WITH REGARDS TO IF

ENVIRONMENTAL- PROGRESS YOU KNOW

02:52:16.926 --> 02:52:19.429
WITH THE URGENCY I THINK

02:52:19.495 --> 02:52:22.532
CALIFORNIA CAN LEAD THE WAY- AND

02:52:22.598 --> 02:52:24.467
IT HAS BEEN LEADING THE WAY THE

02:52:24.534 --> 02:52:28.171
PROBLEM IS THAT. WE WERE.

02:52:28.237 --> 02:52:31.741
REGULATING OUR OWN STATE THE

02:52:31.808 --> 02:52:34.977
POINT WHERE WE CAN'T DO. I DO A

02:52:35.044 --> 02:52:37.280
JOB WELL DONE AND WE EXPECT

02:52:37.346 --> 02:52:39.082
OTHER COUNTRIES TO DO IT ON OUR

02:52:39.148 --> 02:52:40.316

02:52:40.383 --> 02:52:42.518
DIVESTMENT IN THIS IN YOUR WITH

02:52:42.585 --> 02:52:44.854
YOUR BILL BUT THE IMPACT THAT

02:52:44.921 --> 02:52:48.958
HAS ON THE MARKET- WITH.

02:52:49.025 --> 02:52:50.860
LIMITING OUR ABILITY TO PRODUCE

02:52:50.927 --> 02:52:53.096
AND MANUFACTURE HERE VERSUS

02:52:53.162 --> 02:52:54.897
HAVING TO IMPORTED I THINK IT'S

02:52:54.964 --> 02:52:57.533
JUST A MAJOR CONCERN FOR ME.

02:52:57.600 --> 02:52:59.001
BECAUSE AS AS MENTIONED EARLIER

02:52:59.068 --> 02:53:01.571
THE DEMAND IT HAS TO BE- AND I

02:53:01.637 --> 02:53:03.840
THINK WE ARE DOING PROGRESS IN

02:53:03.906 --> 02:53:05.875
THAT SENATOR- MAN I THINK I

02:53:05.942 --> 02:53:07.009

CALIFORNIA ARE BECOMING MUCH

02:53:08.778 --> 02:53:09.579

CHOICES THAN THEY'VE EVER HAD

02:53:13.516 --> 02:53:15.618
BUT I THINK IT'S A SLOW PROCESS-

02:53:15.685 --> 02:53:17.520
JUST THE WAY THE HUMAN NATURE IS

02:53:17.587 --> 02:53:19.355
BUT I THINK CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN

02:53:19.422 --> 02:53:20.656
AND WILL BE LEADING THE WAY THE

02:53:20.723 --> 02:53:24.360
PROBLEM THAT I SEE. IS MOSTLY

02:53:24.427 --> 02:53:26.763

EDUCATION ENTITIES ARE A WE

03:30:37.992 --> 03:30:38.959

03:30:39.026 --> 03:30:40.527
TEACHER WHO TEACHES AT A PUBLIC

03:30:40.594 --> 03:30:42.062

SECURITY BENEFITS- IN THE STATE-

03:30:47.768 --> 03:30:49.636
AND THEN ON THE CLASSIFIED SIDE-

03:30:49.703 --> 03:30:51.238
IT'S THE SAME IF THOSE MEMBERS

03:30:51.305 --> 03:30:53.574

03:30:53.640 --> 03:30:55.776
IS POSSIBLE FOR CHARTERS TO DO-

03:30:55.843 --> 03:30:57.211

TO THEIR CALPERS BENEFIT AND

03:30:58.512 --> 03:31:00.481

EITHER TO INDIVIDUALS OR THE

03:31:05.219 --> 03:31:06.687

03:31:06.754 --> 03:31:08.055
GOING TO BRING IN EXISTING

03:31:08.122 --> 03:31:10.057

03:31:10.724 --> 03:31:12.626
BIT OF A LOGISTICAL NIGHTMARE

03:31:12.693 --> 03:31:14.828

FROM WITHIN AND WITHOUT OF THE
