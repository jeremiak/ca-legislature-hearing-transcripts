See a dark here c√πng what's the care sample cut comma. Council over American Islamic relations right as well as a and W. C. P. not a different bill be here late but. I'm is that where the- thank you thank you very much for coming you know I Creek this says subcommittee on hate crimes three years ago in response to the rice all pay crime through all the state of California. In addition to myself to come meet he is make up of pan of my colleagues in the California State Assembly one of them is here. And the assembly select committee on hate crime serve as a tool to foster community engagement and open dialogue. And collaboration of ethnic and religious organizations LGBT Q. groups law enforcement number profit and other organizations. As much as California has drive to inclusive. And to progressive we still have the highest number of hay group. The sharp increase in hate and bullying related crimes even sold those crimes are generally under reported. So I aid requested audit by the state auditor other hate crying in California we have do we receive the result in may of twenty eighteen include- and the result from the audit report of were very disappointing but not surprising. Hey crime were on the rise yet our state auditor fall many- when. Under reported I reported so due to a variety of reasons including the lack of awareness training and trust between the community and the law enforcement. So in order to protect our community and captured appropriate date. We need stronger policies and implementation of bills policies across the state. This year I have authors for bills god to deal with to protection from hate crime us should a trying to implement some of two recommendation from there a report. They didn't it did take up- didn't go too far I didn't not talk go very far the- AB thrill one. Of both a hate crime data collection and all reach bill. And there will have mandate the repeal of all law enforcement agencies. Every three years to your value a their accuracy of the hate crime data an agency Hey crime policies because they law changes road road we got. A rather the regarding to the hate crime I wanna make sure that all the- his officers a get hated. On the most current a hate crime law. AB fifteen oh two which is a bill that would require peace officers to receive initial and ongoing training. On how to deal with a crime. Es de all did I mention earlier found that under reporting. Work harder- partly due to the lack of updated training so among make short I. R. peace officer receive adequate training. To deal with this is a very important issue. Unfortunately those bill didn't really make it into law. Partially because this state legislature this year we have a police involved shooting bail of what we're trying to. And that really trying to change the police officer's own own use of extreme force or use of force in general. So that a put a lot of. Of a burden responses for. The you post police officers standard training which is a organization there are responsible to provide a of the materials and the training for de um of peace office so they did oppose from pretty much to say well we're we don't have enough capacity. The van was to do to do more of the- training materials and pro by a training to our- of peace officers up and down the California so their own but I'm not I haven't given up on those ideas yet. So next year I would be- willing to- work with my colleagues here and continue push him for about her reporting more accurate reporting better training for the peace officers to address this the. Escalating problem in our state. Often so another another legislative late another legislative idea which I really clean cannot claim credit. Because I know many of the cities and the counties and California have adopted this compassionate other a resolution. So I wanted to make California the first state in the United States. That adopt this compassionate resolution which world declared California V. the pot compassionate to stay in in the United States of America. That's my is C. R. one little eight. Were brought to vote connect your in the assembly and is one of the important reason why we are here. Today to host those hearing. Making California- and compassionate state is not an idea. And I can claim image credit I wanted to the thank. The city of Fremont you know that we have. The adopt this I'd this to a- resolution earlier you know- but as the Buddhist myself. It will have a Hindu hater. Compassionate is to read a way of life. I don't think we can step out hate with Dahle compassion. And being genuine to our approach. This is a ball treating others was. Empathy with respect and putting effort into being hi. It is such a fortunate thing that our district is so diverse I love to brag about this diverse city anyone anywhere I go and I think that along with a great policy ideas. There is a lot of room for us to be kinder to each other in order to prevent and a drop the hatred that is spreading rapidly around our nation. And today we will be hearing from our panel a distinguished panel of M. of religious leaders in our community from a from the district and how they help their community to deal with and to prevent hate crimes Chu compassion. There by will be in your hand out along with a copy of the hate crimes all that report. You can pick the pick them up- at the registration desk outside inside. And we're we're outside okay great. So before any introduced AB- detected distinguished panelists here. Of a like to ask to- my colleague here to make any statement. Thank you very much chair Kansen Chu I do wanna. Certainly thank- a Chris nor would the board I mean the it would not just be and an excellent advocate for education before hosting us- a this evening as well as a- upper per- Basel water vice mayor free one for being here as well- and- and the students- the many students I know I always enjoyed me without the other students here. And I've enjoyed also seen them the student the climate strike as well and I appreciate the advocacy overseeing for young people in the for them to be here I think is really important- and the- the panelists. And I want to get to the palace in the good thing is that you have about thirteen minutes each usually you got to Sacramento if you have one or two minutes so I'm glad we have a chance you actually to finish some thoughts. As you- as you present- but we have an all star panel here that I've known many of them for many years. I certainly compassionate and very thoughtful leaders so I'm so grateful that you're all you're not able to represent this community but as a Kansen said it's very diverse community I think it's a very loving community. But we also have our challenges are always important for us to engage and talk with one another and be that. Model for the rest of the state especially as- it is Kansen moves forward with passion California resident Xin. I only talk about compassionate California that are being compassionate to be apart and should be what woven into everything we do whether it's budgets- whether it policy or whether it's community advocacy and so that's why. I'm very grateful to Kansen Chu up. A chair of the select committee. Thank you thank Kansen Chu so much. His compassionate leadership- which will certainly be missed a state legislature but it's not going anywhere because he's not going anywhere. And I won a. This is a you know get a Kansen days were always going to have them as part of our community sharing that compassion love it so I want to thank Kansen and I look forward to hearing from our panelists. All right thank you AJ. And vice mayor. Thank you. Very well then. Good evening assembly member is- honor to be here- I really appreciate you taking the lead on this- compassionate. California which is one. I in Fremont we are fortunate to have passed the- compassionate Fremont charter. And basically that's relies on the golden rule which is everybody wants treated equally. And at that we take care of our fellow members. And. And so- it's very I need to be some of the hate crimes are happening a lot of them started for example nine then- many of our Sikh Americans suffered a lot of hate crimes and have because of the misperceptions. And just recently in Sunnyvale we also had a hate crime which was a Hindu American was targeted because it up they were of Muslim. And so on only a lot of these are fear based- crimes or- you know tribalism and also a mental health issues and so- I definitely believe that the state needs to have better reporting- and I appreciate the assembly member for- I trying to pass this new- law. Which will allow for better a classification of the crimes by the police department and also be logged in better in the department of justice serving classify the a hate crimes better than we can actually do something about that so I definitely command. Our leaders assembly member Kansen Chu is taking the lead on this and of course our good friend assembly member ash Kalra thank you for having me and look forward to all the speakers it's a great panel. When I know most of the panelists those again thank you. Thank thank you very much I wrote. Five number for. Us to the- president. To make some I'm and I also want to recognize. That our superintendent assure Jordan is in the audience. Wave thank you very much for letting us use your a beautiful a room here and also we have just joined as a Michael hi another school board member. For Milpitas union school district en en captain- whose- on the West Valley mission college bloom. And thank you. President this feature is yours. Thank you and- our office- Kansen thank you very much for being in a previous unified school district of known you guys for. A long time in your work- your work around the community in the county has always been very strong your relationships with schools and school districts- have as have been equally as strong. Because you understand where the work starts so one of the reasons why we're grateful to have the opportunity to host this type of event because we deal with- hate crimes in a very different way. It's where and in the school system is called bullying. And so the fact that this is being hosted here will be able to share it with our students with our teachers. With our leaders and saying that we have an opportunity in a role to play as we create as we work with the development of our young people. If we can help reduce bullying we should believe that there's a correlating affect that we should help reduce hate crimes. So I'm very excited to be here to listen to this distinguished group of panelists. And look for the evening. Thank you. Thank you president or what. So let's get to day Axford less. Introduced to the panelists. A star from my- from my laughed you're right. Is the U. mon tech here and will. Yes thank you. Give them a round of applause you might might will go one at a time okay will die and be patient. We'll get to you. Good evening ladies and gentlemen- my name is t√Åi here on water I'm here on behalf of the Muslim community here in the South Bay- I'd like to begin by thanking assembly member Chiu for facilitating this. And of course the rest of my friends- right in front and on the panel as well. I've got thirteen minutes for an imam thirteen this is actually very very little. But and because of the topic that I've been assigned- I'm gonna be very theological if I may and so I'm gonna free I ask for your forgiveness and hands for that. But with that said I'm hoping I don't take the entire thirty minutes but don't be surprised if I do- the question that was asked is in our religion and our faith how do we promote inclusivity and compassion towards others- as a Muslim- I turn to of course. The holy text as as Muslims we turn to the Koran first and then we turn to the traditions of the prophet Muhammad peace be upon him and I'm gonna spend a few minutes. Just speaking about that- the Koran we believe has a hundred and fourteen chapters and except for one of them- every single one of them begins with in the name of god the most compassionate the most merciful. So that's the first verse in the Koran we talk about compassion and mercy- if we- look at of course the Koran is about the size of the Old Testament which I spent two years of my life memorizing from cover to cover. And my son is done next until the fourth generation who has memorized it from cover to cover- but there's for have topics that are heavily stressed- in the Koran compassion. Of benevolence justice and wisdom. And all of these have to do with things that where- dealing with today in fact there's a direct versus the Koran were god says my mercy encompasses all things we are reminded in our tradition that mercy being merciful is intrinsic. As to who we are as human beings in fact the Arabic word era because not my mother tongue just for the record my parents are from India I learned Arabic much later in my life- the word for wound. In the Arabic language is awesome- and I'm actually literally means mercy and that's where members we built we believe in our tradition where mercy begins the love between the compassion the love between the mother and the child which then gets passed on to. The community there's two verses in the Koran that I want to share portions of the verses that I want to share in this these are sort of- Guiding. Light for us in our tradition- god says in chapter forty nine let not a people ready killing other people perhaps they may be better than them. Nor let women ready kill other women perhaps they may be better than that and do not insult one another and do not call each other by offensive nicknames the Koran is very very clear about just calling others by names are making fun of other individuals. Let alone hurting them right one is to make fun of someone and then the other is to bully them or a hate crime and that sort of the foundation. As far as you know we've been talking about I've I've lived in the Silicon Valley I've lived in San Jose for- thirty seven years now- we talk about a very diverse community how to Muslims deal with diversity- if you've been to any. Muslim of you know there's a verse of the Koran that is often cited an off shared we've created you from male female did you people in tribes so that you may know one another. Indeed the most noble of you the sight of god is the most righteous of you. And so we. He our tradition believe in diversity we believe that people are going to be diverse. Act traditionally as Muslims- when we refer to individuals- as a sign of remembering that you're known by the name of the town that you're from so in fact one of the- some of the most. Up with resourceful books that we have in our tradition are so for example let me give you an example one of the collections of the traditions of the prophet Muhammad which is really really famous. Is the individual's name no one knows about his name they know ms Behati. The reason they known as bodies because he's from the town of bajada. And similarly. You know when I was studying- my I'd no one ever knew my last name my last name was a many key. The American. Yeah that's that's very interesting and so we when we talk about diversity diversity is intrinsic to who we are but we are one family we are one family as a people of our faith and we're also one family as humanity. We turn to the traditions of the prophet Muhammad and this is something which is- you know a very commonly mentioned in every every religion has sort of a saying around this in in our tradition we remind ourselves. No one truly believes until they desire for their brother or sister with a desire for themself in other words if you want peace mercy compassion for yourself that's what you you if you're not a perfect human being unless otherwise you desire that for the other individual. And a lot of times my kids are a little older now when they understand but when I was younger- my children sorry when my children sorry when I well when I was younger too but when my children. Were younger and they wouldn't see me at home in the evening and some of you who've known me in the room no that I was a great advocate needs senior a lot of different places. My children ask and say why and I would really believe and I tell- individuals that you know I San Jose is home for me California is home for me the United States is home for me and my religion. Teaches me too sure that my home my and remains a safe place and so it is my faith. That drives me to go up there not to convert people very clear about that is not I'm not do and you know that you know I'm not here to proselytize I don't do my work to proselytize I'm here to do my work because that's I feel that it's an obligation on me as an individual. To ensure that I do my part for my community that. You know we don't hate you and we don't hate each other and when we talk about hating each other you can't you know sometimes when you don't know someone- you may hate them but you may still be a wonder around them right who. Are they what are they do it took a I've. I've lived in San Jose for. Of a number of years now and I'm for some of my neighbors it took them a little while to warm up to me. I'm gonna be honest with you this and as a for god's sake. You know they couldn't figure out who I was when they figured out it was Muslim. You know you it's like okay what do you do inside your house. Of until they saw my kids playing outside and running outside in me playing ball my kids and so on and so forth it's sort of. A humanize me. Around my neighbors- but I didn't do that for my neighbors I did that for my own self I did that because my faith teaches me to be compassionate. And to be. Nine towards the individuals around be. I just want to share a few traditions. From the prophet Mohammed- this is of course this is fourteen hundred years ago a man came to the prophet Muhammad said- profit I have ten sons and I've never kissed any of them. The profit looked at looked at him and said he who has no compassion will receive none. Right when you talk about compassion this is directly from the teacher the prophet Mohammad. The prophet Muhammad is narrated to have said. A kind word or even a smile is a form of charity. Serve muscles are walking around smiling. It's because you know we're being charitable and if we're not. Tell us to smile. We talk about we talk you know we begin with we begin with home we talk about our neighbors- it there's a tradition of the prophet Muhammad that says. That you're not a complete believer. Unless you've ensured that forty of your neighbors all of your neighbors have. Been fed. And so they went to the prophet Muhammad and similar to other religious traditions all they would probably moms of any neighbors at forty homes. Forty homes I don't know forty my neighbors and is going to be honest with you. But not yet. But but I mean that's that's that's our tradition in fact. There's so much in our in our tradition around the rights. Of neighbors. That of the companions his his companions later on said that the prophet Muhammad would mention that are the rights of neighbors so much. That we thought they would actually inherit from us when we would pass- that's that's when we talk about so that's that's part of my tradition and my religion now of course. I can I can say so much more but I'm I'm gonna stop with that piece. As Muslims up you know. Muslims came to americana to what a lot of people believe. Since came to America with Columbus. Muslims came to the Americas- during slave trade to the all of America's so we've been here. For a very very long time there's entire- books written on this topic if you're interested in reading about it I can share some names with you- a lot of the immigrant. Push sort of came in the fifties and sixties and seventies. Where people like my parents came out here- for you know to get an education to. Be a part of this community and they made this land home. So people still me sometimes and think I don't speak a word of English. I actually speak English in about four one accents and I do them all very well. But what you know as so you know our Moscow our mosque in San Jose is operating our fortieth anniversary next year that's our fortieth formal anniversary we've been around for about five years. Before that one of the things some of the things that we do in our community we get a lot of community service health click soup kitchens- if you come our our sermons are on Friday they're open to the entire community we you know it's not like. If someone else walks in from a different community the imam pulls out another sermon I always joke about it right the sermons are for everyone- and a lot of what we discussed in our sermons is community service is compassion is mercy. Is how to. Be kind to those around you combine to even those who are not kind to you in return that's what my faith teaches people- now. If some people of my faith choose not to do that you can't hold me responsible for that- if. Certain media outlet may want to cover certain things in a different way well there's only so much that I can do. About that- but you know the things any evil act that's being done in the world in in the name of my faith or the name of any faith for that matter anyone will tell you that. That's not correct- that's not how it's going to be- yeah I know I told you I wasn't a mom I take the full thirteen minutes. You can that's okay. I'm just gonna I'm really quickly I'm gonna close- up the hate crimes against Muslims of course is not just on a large scale in the United States but believe in us actually very heavily funded as well lot of people don't realize this there's risen tire- research reports statistics and I knew I to have time for citing bring them but if you go online and hate crime funding against Muslims there's an entire report out there where this entire the Islamophobia industry is heavily funded by people living right here. In the United States of America- there was a report released last week by care and I saw some in here a little while ago from care of California report being bullied because of their faith more than twice the national average for bullying in schools for all students. Which is why many Muslim families and I don't think it's fair but many Muslim families are choosing to homeschool their children so their children don't have to face a lot of this and it's not fair to the children- I'm I'm gonna close I'm gonna close with one quote from Henry David Thoreau- he said it is never too late to give up your- business. Thank you very much. Thank you. Among was his cells of the lawmaker association and actually have a die in fishers who's a director of Jewish community relations council of Silicon Valley I am taking a thank you assemblymember for including me too and I think it says something that all the folks sitting here on know each other and have a long history of encouraging comparison in our community. Of. So money first thought and Piney this request to talk about compassion in the Jewish community. Led me to revisit the vigil for solidarity against hate that we held in front of St as a city hall. Almost a year ago a and that was in response to the shooting of eleven people at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh. And that image of so many diverse faiths represented and government. Everyone standing in solidarity in mourning. And in saying we are better than that together was a very profound expression of compassion- and the ease some of you may have seen aye sixty minutes last Sunday for the anniversary of this event there was a piece on sixty minutes and- the- we're showing them a service at a synagogue. Where any mom said just tell us where you need us to be what do you need us to do what do you need so that you feel safe. Rate and to me that's what this is about right this is a an expression of compassion is what what is it take for kindness to be expressed to affect someone else's life. Eight and I think this is what religion is about trying to I don't think it's so much about believe I think it's about. Behaving in a compassionate way- it's about empathy and concern and justice tolerance in fairness and respect rate so even though that the Jewish code of ethics is based on a very well known commandment love your neighbor as yourself it's really not about a motion rate it's a commandment that's about. Hannibal behavior in our everyday lives. SO we have individual acts of compassion and these can combine into communal compassionate- accident in Jewish tradition. Is considered important that we be buried. Of at least in part by our friends and family not just by strangers right so we have this tradition where you actually. Difficult pick up a shovel and participate in the burial rate. He did the same rate in the Muslim tradition nay on and it's an ultimate act of compassion because the disease person can't repay the effort to you right. On providing healthcare is another area that I thought about because it's very deeply can connected to compassion in in Jewish tradition in many traditions. My synagogue holds a on. An annual health fair that's usually at eastside church every year where dozens of doctors and nurses come and provide free exams are procedures- collaboration with other health care providers from other faith communities. And another thing that came to my mind was about a year ago I visited at a hospital in Israel in northern Israel where I spoke with three Syrian man who were there getting treatment on the day had been injured in and the fighting. In Syria they had come to the border on to come to the Israeli hospital so that was an act of compassion it had nothing to do with anything else right. Thinking about the on. Recent efforts by the department of homeland security to change the- the meaning and effective public charge. People than filing that rate nay the which can that affect people's ability to be admitted as immigrants United States- which fortunately has been temporarily stopped by a preliminary injunction but- I thought about it a different compassionate approach to helping immigrants- that my community- had which was- keeper free loan. Rate about a hundred years ago in Jewish people were immigrating a larger numbers to this country on. He were free loan was created so with that and people could have a an interest free loan to start a business or adopt children or pay for health care- you know get job training them any kind of emergency. And it was basically advertises a alone for those who need a hand up not a hand out a that was the purpose and my husband's grandparents- got an interest free loan and started a little a hardware store in the Fillmore district in San Francisco. And now we have three generations of our family that have continued to thrive because of that act of compassion. On something that's it was an important example for me. Some people we think that legislating compassion is perhaps it sounds like we're trying to do is impossible but even if I just look at my own Jewish tradition it's clear. That when we talk about kind is give me live has said in Hebrew it's a behavior that we say everyone should engage in whether you feel motivated to do it or not Hey that's good or not. The point ray- and in the Hebrew Bible we- are we've known to repeat thirty six times some form of Dona press the stranger rate. And the rabbi say it's repeated because it's really hard rate it's a goal for us to treat people that are different from ourselves with compassion but we need the reminder and I think. This assembly resolution on compassion is another necessary reminder rate let's let's just say this a lot and often because we clearly in a time when we need this reminder. So where it work discussing this compassion partly because of Kern Armstrong's wish in two thousand eight rate that. That there's a charter for compassion around the same time Jeremy Rifkin read a book. Titled the empathic civilization and he wrote that were software to experience others feelings. Through mirror neurons in our brains Hey we have empathy because we understand our own frailties and we feel solidarity with other people's vulnerability. And the last ten years is in a lot of research on the assumptions of our human nature. Rate on it shows that we're not software to be utilitarian and self interested in materialistic rate. That sociability an attachment. Affection and empathy our our key wiring so our government and our families and our businesses and our education. They need to be in a re oriented to it to be adapted. To our focus center human capacity for compassion. Our cell phones in our communication tools are often considered to be like our big down fall in our ability to be compassionate but they also function to bring more diverse people together so in Jeremy Rifkin's but he also talks about what brought people into empathic feelings for each other. On and how that's changed from ancient civilizations till now so compassionate aging times was basically blood ties rate if you really related to somebody and then religious ties right all Muslims feel tight and all Jews held tight enough Christians feel tied to each other. And then we had national identity ties rate Creek French and German ties whatever rate of that but now people have the ability to empathize with others that don't live near them at all they don't. They don't. Have the same religion that don't even speak the same language right you can use Google translate and you can talk to anybody anywhere in the world. So we have individual power to communicate with each other without any kind of top level controls mandating it we have like distributed compassion possibility. And really at the end of our lives it's that Ana empathic connection to people which we consider. To be the most important thing we've done it all in our time. So in light of our current social ills I think this focus on compassion also needs to take. The form of practicing tolerance for people who. Think differently than ourselves and particularly in California we're gonna set a trend this is important. S. Hebrew word for tolerance is sold l√† newt. It derives from the words several which means. To suffer so in other words we have to injure a certain amount of discomfort. To tolerate people with different views ray and Kern Armstrong also said that a compassionate city one of the things about it is it needs to be an- uncomfortable. City rate SB we just need to accept that. Tolerance isn't isn't just about acting kindly to people that we believe are a rung. It's also recognizing that there might be some truth. In positions that we disagree with rate the Talmud teaches that intellectual growth depends on exposing yourself to a variety of viewpoints a we need to. To know about other views with which we possibly do we otherwise we have an incomplete understanding. But there's one. Thing that Jewish tradition teaches. As where in tolerance is a virtue. Which is in opposition to someone who if they gain power would deny freedom to those with which they disagree. So we should stand strongly against anyone using democracies tolerance for an effort to overthrow it so I think that in our current situation this call for compassion. Should be joined together with a call to sustain our democracy thanks. Thank you thank you Diane I think you you had the head of the nail right beard see you know this compassionate. A resolution is really only serve as a reminder you know we need to the committee involvement we need to religious leaders seem often through the to move to our state and the more compassionate stay so it was you really truly. A reminder I'll also wanna thank you for your- your work on the roof G. settlement. I remember was Mike my district staff was one one day want to our office and stuff a lot of back pack will going back to school so thank you very much for reaching out to the community. And actually. Have a father Joe home prodigal. Father John is from a Catholic charities of Santa Clara county. Okay Sir thank you very much for inviting me to speak to this issue Margaret Mead was asked. What was the signed the first sign of civilization and she responded the heel femur he'll femur bone of the strong his bones in the body but once is broken it's very very difficult and it makes it income it it- percent Mendoza prison unable to defend him or herself they will need other people the to care for them so the early sign of a civilization was actually finding. A healed femur bone because it presumes that the people that were- with this particular group of early humanoids are bandied around gathered around this individual and care for the person just put themselves in front of danger to heal this person and that fact that was healed that person was was taking care for a long time so that idea. Of compassion is hard wired into our species but it's also broke in our by a deliberate design decision to go against our human nature what we see happening right now. Hate crimes increasing gets Latinos are over 50% and I think that you heard the mom to hear who'd excused of for purposes a few minutes- talked about the increase in in hate crimes against Muslims in the Jewish to hate crimes increase 60% in these- in the past two years of the hate crime is not an accident that is happening but it's to the direct language coming from the very top. So we understand that I was just in el Paso with bishop mark science who signed a pastoral letter linking and very clearly showing the linkage between hate language racism and border policies and how that affects people in el Paso he's a bishop in el Paso he's he watched and was walking with the people the twenty three people that were murdered- because of their race and when we speak to people in our community have gone to do focus groups have gone to my own membership and- different groups around the county. Income in this district that people are saying that they now for. Feel they are hunted because of the color of their skin and his identifies Latinos. This is coming on the heels what law in the Latino community in the Catholic outlet here community they see these these ideas of a public charge they see these are the separation of our family the border. Over the phone into cages are at the their deliberately top being targeted by these policies and by the language- and children are very very aware of what's happening. I to them and because of that we want to I just want to say this very clearly because I know speaking as a is there a question in all of this and I. Come out of the Catholic tradition but- since I was Reyes Buddhist and my dad was a Protestant and I became Catholic- I think I can speak on a three ecumenical experience. Level experience a level- and hang out with a lot of my friends are Jewish that are going to Buddhist things and other Sufi things so I having a lot of these very strange friends. But the idea what I do one is. So strange you know but I think. Substituting but with these guys up here but I think where the people are. The whole going on. But I think that what you we is people of faith. I did exception that. Leadership of at the very highest levels are co opting religious language. As a way to justify hatred. And then activity even with those who are Christian. That we know that within in their Christian ranks. There are a number of people that agree with these policies. That see nothing wrong with. Putting children in cages they see nothing wrong with. A taking away health care. Of from families in need. And they see nothing wrong with ignoring the Fourteenth Amendment which gives every. Person living in the United States and any of its territories. The same due process and everybody else. That we they they forget that there's a constitutional reality. And they're willing to overlook that and overlook all the- evo all these kinds of things and so I called my Christian brothers and sisters. Who may be in this room but certainly to let you. Know that- that we came out of. You out of it out of a Jewish context. And so we have inherited a rich tradition of what Dianne just finished speaking about of course said of loving kindness. Of loving mercy of living that out in faith we can't do that so out of Christian Christian scriptures have to be understood in the context of what is it mean. To reflect on the Torah on the law of god love more. Is revealed to Moses and that we and all of our teachings come out of the idea that. That in are there is no distinction of male female slave or free that we are all one it doesn't make that difference so that that makes it very clear that this question of. Separate bathrooms is ninety and you can't use that is a it from a Christian perspective I think you can think you are but you clearly when you look at scripture. Once and such strong ground the other ideas at that in if even within Christian scripture speaks of salvation is being. Everyone gathered around the one throne of god and the lamb of god they identified as Christ Jesus. That at around that lamb of god in this kind of idea this. Powerful imagery it is all nations gather regardless of race tried nation and people that they're all gather together and seeing each other as one. Again so with in the Christian tradition there is. A sense of racial equality there is no sense of separation superiority and lastly- the historically asistir lanes now speaking of the character historical tradition. We have always been a church of immigrants so we came over as immigrants ourselves- most of the of the priest of the dice is a San Jose or immigrants very few were actually native born the from. India the from different countries in Africa they're from different countries and Spanish speaking America's- Europe and all throughout Asia. So we is a Catholic Church in this diocese. You know are not just video of a church of immigrants your church that is solidly walking with him in immigrants. In it is specifically of those were the most broken most vulnerable to these policies. And there's a language that has victimized- our people. Are lastly we talk about the idea of some of the as a victim. Of violence then that that you know we used to think there's only two choices when you're silent victim you just take it. Your strong you move on that's my mother's Japanese tradition that you know you just. All the things that happened her folks the her people I'm that you just. Yo you just move ahead. And you move ahead was silent and steely determination. But not everybody how's that and once that is an option. To and the other thing that we don't want the people have another option they think is just being an object of someone else's charity well at the legislators. Make a rule for us will make will have a grant finder give us some money will have some teacher some other institution speak for us. And that's wrong. Because people are to speak for themselves. And so that the job of the religious community is certainly in my experience. Is that we need to create that space for those who are directly affected those were directly. Beaten by these kinds of policies this kind of language and physically attacked because of their race their gender identity this sexual orientation or their religious affiliation because- these are the people that need to be at the table to speak and views the people that need to be the cages. Tables that make those decisions about what does it mean to be compassionate. Because IT. You can pass as white I'm not white but I can pass a sense all day get you know sure. But you know what. Not everybody that can pass by. Not everybody can enjoy the certain privileges. And so that our belief at least in for our Calvet tradition is that people we need to create that space for people to speak directly from their experience we but we- have a- verse that we- we- we understand is. God hears our cries the poor some thirty four. Or thirty three diverse aye account by the to that this idea is that. You god is hearing the cries the poor and therefore it is incumbent upon those who call themselves allegiance to god or people of god. They must also here these very same crises. They can't go empty into the desert. So creating space means this and it's a simple theology- that we are getting from- that we receive is Catholics. From a pope Francis who leads us by example and by. By by encouraging. Not just Catholics but people of all good will is that creating space means you quite in if you increase the space for listening. Encuentro and that is really that the mutually. Transformative experience of listening to another person creating that space for that. That story that narrative to be told and that means that we have to step back. And recover the art of listening and stop the dialogue in. In in in in tweets are in income will silly remarks. My roommate making finger gestures from the earth to the moon whatever I mean you can't do those things without stopping and listening and creating that space. For an interpersonal. Connection to happen so our methodology at least I'm working with a group that's working on the methodology of encuentra that is mutually counter we're we listen and those who have that. Have privilege don't talk about the privilege but they simply listen. They become aware of who they are and who space they walk and we're aware of the land. On a who. You on a who we occupy we occupy the because stone's we occupy the Aloni we occupy the met various different me walk the various different. Communities and nations that there on this land we are inherently wear that and we're connected to the planet were connected to listening and so that encuentra. Is that dialogue that begins in listening and humbleness of you where people are in their lives and that experience with calls is solidarity or celebrity that. That experience a solidity that of solidarity weakens in us we call continues us you own. A wakening and not just awareness but a commitment. To continuing that dialogue. And so for- for from my perspective fact I think that and I. One minute. Okay thank our get sick as a priest in go on forever but I won't- but but I want to talk about the idea of solidarity because that's ultimately what we're all call to do in terms of creating compassion and solidarity is it just as a stance in your head or- ideological perspective it is actually putting our bodies. Next to other people our bodies are in solidarity not our minds on if not a theology not our ideology and it's not about honest commitment of walking with feeling empathizing and making it your because as well as I think that the piece in terms of faith me that's the work that we're trying to do we do that in a bunch of different kind of zip codes where we were as Catholic charities we work. With our agent we work with rather with our clients we trick train those who work with the people are case workers a case managers it is all about that listing and accompanying an individual. No matter what's happened that compassion has to flow from our humidity at that comes from the fact that we have a heel femur in our ancestor and that he'll teamer. Has to be handed down from generation to generation. Thank you thank you very much. Of the John. Does want to take a- few minutes to. Go over some housekeeping I can. And do will be time for public comment at the end. And for those in the audience that would like to make a public comment. Please raise your hand and one of my staff can provide you with the car. Views me. Thank you now- moving on to- Jewish shop from the- the cofounder of the chain center. And all of northern California by hearing in milk this. Cherish. Okay. In the technology world you always have to line. Thank you again for inviting me. I I'm going to talk a little bit of our to our fate because most people who may not know all what Chen is a means. And what we believe. And there is the freight the green we live in. The twine with compassion no the principles are really. Intel integrated into our belief system so I will talk about a little so you can understand that I come from. A Chen community is a very small community. Even in India it is less than 1% of end of population. In America is about the same. And all we are about two hundred thousand James in North America US and Canada. And here in the bay area we probably are about. Twenty five hundred families that are part of heart. Number here in may be this. So we don't experience all the different problems that other communities of experience because we are invisible. And of course in of pecan del Rio in a Jan because we looked like any other Indian or any other a in in America so. It's kind of difficult. But we Chen said later the lenders contribution to India and its culture. Far beyond is numbers. In all kinds of situations are open and culturally economically everything a charity Gen seven to the forefront in India. En route to a trying to emulate dot over here by being generous in the community. So what does it bring back to those who do not much margin ism. I like to say that. Journalism arose from pension prehistorical time in India. That I've never twenty four forty quality. Operators of human in all nay in nature the born human and the victims the end and they became probably it'll journalism op that the twenty to thirty the- program which is impossible. Not was about eight hundred and fifty BC. My average of the twenty fourth. Teachings often followed now are was six hundred BC and this tool. At the moment was not it is have been accepted by historians as historical people so that they exist at and they'll drone the land of India. Even though I llama is all in of the lie l√† my knees book for as a group conserve afraid describe Jenny's on. As it principally of. Buddhism. Because more Chen is up some photos from what is known as Camelot division of. That was they have a long long time. Many of our principles are similar. Journalism is a way of life. It's a philosophy and a way of life. We don't have a god creator. Because you believe the universe of exist a four hour and continues to exist. Nothing gets destroyed nothing gets created in the works. Hands. Which survey of life and is driven by the beauty of karma. That you saw watch hello you reach such a saw. And that that is how we have always constantly to be. At our best because anything that we do is going to come back to haunt him. For thousands of years Gen certain practicing vegetarianism about meditation and the environment. James believing that those old bridges o'donnell and divine we believe which are sold as a Donald and divine. By the way there is no sections. So does have a sex so what we have is a body solo plaza body when it takes both. Sometimes you might get a female parties under the main body sometimes you get a neutral party. In a transgender. But we also recognize that beyond the physical body which is. Which you get based on your he got the karma. Or nam karma. There is actually a mental state. And so you could have a physical he in all male body but your mental state because of your of karma the type of for my dad did delude in government. You could have a female magic. And that's what so we recognize that there is a difference between the mind set or room in the inclination reverses the physical body you up. Which means that you should be looking at if I look at you grandson and say oh grandson is Chinese American. I have committed issues crime. I should be seeing you as Kansen Chu √Åi servicing as a soldier. Has loan Reyes there there's no. No collar low S. sex nothing at all so moment think of someone else other. You are actually. Driving that violence on the person. And of course is that violence is on your part and we believe that violence of talked is equally bad as violence of actual physical one. Because we believe not harming himself or non violence is by after a speech and by thought. And all of them have to be controlled by you. A three ton that's that we have is the second one is under god what or multi procedural viewpoint. And I call that as a non while of talked. Because in our view on the multiplicity of viewpoints. Look and think about the other's point of view. Muscles point of view were the same. And by looking at others point of view you may see something different life altogether. And that makes two thousand actually the word tolerance is not as Burke as acceptance we call it you have to accept the other stocks because there may be some. Faith in its on putting it and you have to find that. Silicon Albright discard a by because of principle of an icon. The other one of course is. Of non possessiveness and I'm not gonna talk about Medina long position that which we have but Paul just a mental long possessiveness. Attachment to your children is mental possessiveness. Attachment to or hate to someone else is a mentor possessiveness. It's it is your mental this implies that you have to control so that you would not be affected by your. The very important part of Chen philosophy is forgiveness and I want to read something one of our aphorism. Is commonly so would you agree so would you recommend to me. The missile will borders so. Number John McKenzie. Everybody in the store that. I forgave all of the all beings may all living beings brown who forgiveness. My friendship as with all living beings I have no animosity towards any that's what the effort as a means. It truly says I am asking and this is the this aphorism is practical. Saved by. The challenge the bill Jones are overlap baptising Gaines. Almost every single day. To do mind you constantly that you have to ask for forgiveness you have to give forgiveness and forget and you should be friendly with everyone and you should. Not have any enemies I would go on to that is. Another row. I will keep my time I think I better not so bad this forgiveness will destroy hatred and fear. When you forgive somebody you can no longer hate. And possibly forgiving and also the Skinner forgiveness which we do. With a worse for me Charlie but I'm- and I'm sure you heard some of those books. Which means that I'm asking for part excuse. For give me because I have done something wrong. Joint committee is as I was saying is a small committee is a charitable committee does a lot of chatter W. unknown projects in India. He had even our youth will all to serve those at the shelter. The global serve the homeless. And we encourage our children to. Participate but you know because our Sunday school children. And we're getting to get involved in too many of the activities not as many as I like. But because of the numbers are small and many of our people have come recently H. one B. visa guys so they hadn't that that here for sort of trying. To has of course I have been here fifty sixty hours so I have seen this. Land here change and this is home. Never talk about the concurrent resolution a one oh eight. This is the resolution that we need to have an adoption I am very happy glad that are. Eminem the member Kansen Chu has taken that and- for that resolution up. Any of the community like is a free will and others have signed on. Site because time and I county also has signed on toward ambassadors and adapted confirmed. And I'm also represent Silicon Valley interreligious counselor the war wise chair and we have been part of that effort. Promote people adopt a charter for a charter for compassion. What this will do is it'll become a lighting roar lightning roar to everybody in the community in the California. Because once it is state is his added compassionate state everybody will want to get on the band. And high hopes that enable to encourage them to get on the background and signed the combatant compassion and become compassionate not just by name. Because you would have to that act accordingly. Your a all of the laws you may have to be judge by the measure of compassion and on maybe compassion index or something like that that we create so the region's matted like the tried each item back stashed in a statement that. Many of the copies half. Those indexes can be created and we can see on the truly compassionate. There's actually a study by city alluvial. Did they did what is a compassionate index and they started all the different districts to see how compassionate bill there and we will look into it after. Your resolution is passed to see how that technology. That methodology can help us. Measure compassion that is and measure the change that happens. In my opinion the get income in California as a compassionate state will foster cultural compaction compassionate action and talk so if you want to create a culture of compassionate action promoting friendliness among California residents which will help us all current community. Challenges we have a blank compassion games the lastly I want to recommend I recommend a couple things first include forgiveness and compassion training in schools I non black non religious basis children should learn forgiveness right from the charter. Rear tires I'm also the board member of getting the vision- organization and V. remote mindfulness and live still living in skilled rise scores of some of the schools in South Bay. And children not very happy doing five minutes of meditation in the morning and the results are. Absolutely of a sky in terms of the behavior and up so there so we should promote second is modernize forums to promote. Compassion and forgiveness and general public periodically. And my third is that view to create a measure compassionate such as index for different counties in California. Thank you. Thank you very much interest your but. Next we'll move to. Rajiv our our. Under rare Iago for over you are you all use a podium it Ohara. Okay. No beer is was to seek coalition. Thank you right- so of thank you for having me here. I am the best thing of I am not a religious let leader by any measure. I am actually a volunteer with sickle Rhaetian and also a member of a grassroots level team that we founded in city of Fremont to deal with the backlash. Of that we felt after nine eleven and I have a co founders of the team in my room and in the room as well. In our eyes I'm standing. Because I. I'm used to talking what step out. I I'm a software engineer so I just feel lost if I'm talking with a slight so that you will see some slides. And I'm also a college. As of another reason to have slides up the right. Plus I can see you- that it is so wonderful to see all the young faces initial the students this is this is the next generation of Americans that it at this heart warming to see them here and actually listen in. At and be part of this. Let me begin with a heartfelt thanks to. The Assemblymembers. The brain behind issue out of one oh eight and the co authors of one it. I would also like to room extend my thanks to. All the people who have worked behind behind the scenes on this this is this is not something that can be done easily. Hey and I'm looking forward to the day of an S. C. R. well no it does get passed and it helps us to a point where we can say. For me a second. As the. California usually is all and- select decision for each each no we met him in another it's not. Shop did. It's to give you a quick overview of who six are because not everybody knows who six are the- even though in in the bay area visit believe there seem to be a lot because of that our months. But there are very few six of in terms of percentage of population if you look at a number of the demographics nationwide even in India. Get six for less than 2% of the population. So what. What okay judge. Okay am I doing anything okay there is there's just a lack. All right. Okay so of. Six sick ism- is it it has compassion in grand into stagings in so many ways of that- it is hard to explain it in a few words. The compassion that was exemplified by founder of the faith who we call a good- the word good who has a very special meaning for six it's not an export of some kind in a subject matter Google means a person who shows you the way throughout your life. The person who enlightens your path. So when you his sit here lower good in the sick contacts please please. Take note of the distinction so compassion was exemplified by the thick crews in my many ways it is built into the golden rules of the sick faith. The six prayer the daily six prayer actually ends with the asking for well being of all. All humans all creation. Get six plus the worship which are known as good a daughters we have a good but I had a movie does a go to the three mile island Santa. Ana the liberalism of the- they also this. Nothing.

The rest of the members and is here one. We can help look up first compassion US thank you. Thank you very. Last but not least we have the can do a mereka and foundation points north in California chapter Raji you've seen. Good evening and I must say thank you namaste. Thank you assembly member Chiu for a giving us this. Opportunity and organizing the event. While I'm here representing him the American foundation as you said I'm also representing the wider into our community only in California but also nationwide- I want to take the opportunity to also thank assembly members bloom Burke Kalra lackey and however for co authoring the resolution. Thank you in CinemaCon Reyes here. I'll be a little more scripted- than other presenters because I'm presenting about five thousand years of story of come compassion here. So that said as a Hindu I'm glad to report that I can share more than one definition often those. Regardless of which ever narrative you choose- to remember your discover that Hinduism means many philosophies and schools of thought many forms to express these thoughts. And a rich tapestry of human values. The more Hindus he will meet the more you realize that there is not one but numerous numerous bats practices and piety there is no one perfect way our world. In fact we embrace in perfect because it lands us an opportunity to understand the world around us. Now if I were to tell you the same story but in reverse order. The narrative will be something like this. There are people in this world who are comfortable with this imperfect world that we live in. Either through their own natural constitution. All through the observation of the richness of the creation around us they have come to respect the different avenues people have historically taken. To understand the world around them. The trace this open an acceptance of parts to overturn lainnya. Too many texts art forms lower and practices. These other hinders. And that is pluralism I believe off the COR offended them all beings from the smallest organism man are considered manifestations of the divine or deflections of Devine's qualities. Because of this shared divinity in those views the universe as the family or as in Sanskrit we say it must've they've become. The Hindu world has been able to embrace the reality of diversity and relish and religious freedom through its philosophy of pluralism. Every being with their varying likes and dislikes their own unique personalities and different cultures normally connect with one another in their own unique ways. But connect with the wind in their own individual way. This embrace of tourism has taken contributed to the incredible spiritual and religious freedom. One witnesses within Hinduism which often confuses up people in the west. The word pluralism is not just acceptable to Hindus but all members of universal family accordingly does it make knowledge is not just the possibility but also the existence of more than one path. Or way of really into the truth bath being religion and truth being caught. This is true on adulterated pluralism is captured in the ancient Sanskrit pan which are will translate in English that says truth is one the wise call it by the names. It doesn't matter which direction narrative of Hinduism. Fix your interest what you're likely to discover is that none of the diversity and richness and in the tradition would have been possible without respect. Not mere tolerance but respect. And then you will discover the substrate underneath all of this which is compassion that Hindus have not only for us but for every life form around us in fact comparison isn't grained in the ultimate goal of every- moksha or freedom from the cycle of birth and rebirth is characterized by the overcoming of spiritual ignorance the complete elimination of material desires and attachments the affected ability to live in the present moment. And XP is absolute peace. Most importantly the awakening of your compassion towards all. Dianne talked about the progression of a bit earlier off- blood ties to religious ties to natural ties it by under sorted right. One man. Took that advice. Many many years ago and created one of the biggest moments which we today because the Gandhi's. Still rights disobedience moment which was non violent. And he then also influenced. Outside of his nation to the global war people like Dr king to take on with the same compassion the biggest challenges that he faced in his time and his people face for many many. Centuries before that. See this is what we cannot. Get him while we are here in California is the California's biggest story of compassion right here at home. I h√¨nh saw or non violence. Is one of the most important pillars of Hindu philosophy. Concept of a hand size deeply embedded in the videos the engine in the pictures which proposed that all beings from the smallest optimism man Acosta manifestations of god and members of universal family. This word view what plans and talked. Words he'd against a living being is contrary to the natural balance of this universe. Not just physical violence but violence in fought and. And even that the. The spirituality is a more by the Hindus. Compassion is a psychological construct that day let hate to situate in a society. But the question still remains which is how do we spread compassion. Compassionate California's announced that. It encourages us to improve the lives of all can only a residents. And treat them with dignity the consistently and emphatically to frame from inflicting pain to act or speak violently out of spite or self interest towards any of the being or group of beings. Impoverishing exploit or deny basic rights to anybody and to incite hatred by denigrating others these are not my words these are the works. Of the resolution that you folks have written great profound words compassionate club California. Is the and in the sale of organizations. American foundation that amber pretending here today. That is a gazed in efforts to bring justice to victims of hate crime. Working to stop bullying in schools. Acting bias in textbooks and promoting human rights and religious freedom. Weakened them and work against hatred violence and discrimination against all community. That's why we've we proud to work with us remember choose office on important pieces of hate crime legislation here in California that make all communities safer to strengthen. Hate crime protection assembly bill three hundred. Accuracy in reporting of hate crimes and incidents and assembly bill one zero five two. Require peace officers to and- comprehensive training on hate crimes to better identify and respond to hate crimes. Then you also talked about legislating compassion. Earlier our new use the word impossible or difficult but something along those lines. But I think that's only half of the equation. Even if we manage to legislate compassion which I think we are sincerely wanting to do that's what I'm sensing the. With the with the strength in which we have shown up. The young people that I think is the future of California I think will be successful in it. We have to promote a culture of compassion. It is the only sensible approach to making such a diverse collection of people have in California a place that is safe peaceful and welcoming. But compassion is more than just. About being able to call up a home and feel safe and secure. A bigger outcome of compassion. Is the diversity dividend. Which we are already reaping hearings at in Silicon Valley. But we have a bigger opportunity in front of us so even if you are not a person who believes in combat is an out of. Compassion out of spirituality if you are business minded person capitalist a hardcore capitalist. There is a story of compassionate California that only propel us even farther father had. On the global economic index if they were to be one. Hindus have a thousand a few thousand years of history to share as evidence- compassion is not a political necessity it doesn't exist existentialists yesterday. And then. About a billion of us who can tell you that it works. So with that thank you again for the opportunity thank you assembly members and thank you for all the- Dahle staff for making this possible. Thank you thank you so much. The thank you for the D. percent through the two distinguished panelists your feedback and recommendations are specially valuable as you understand. What our community needs you know we have about twenty minutes- sure okay how how long can we keep this room. So don't get don't do many ideas. All right so I know we have some high school students and- they have some comments or questions so before we can go back to the dais can we ask of high school students to come up first you can make your common you're welcome to stay as long as you can. Or you go home and finish your homework. So we. I understand that you have some prepared comments so feel free to come up it. To the to the podium. Uhhuh working right now Hello of my name's Kristy park and I'm originally eerie and we're from archbishop many high school representing the midi advocacy project our schools student run social justice advocacy club on thank you so much for having us here and to his Chen for inviting us of it's really great opportunity of end we think that a ACR one away is really great because it perfectly aligns with our mission of creating a compassionate community- one bond and empathy and okay understanding- and as father John in ms Fisher talked about creating a- space for open dialogue. And that's one of the things that we really pursued during our of time that maybe because we've invited speakers such as the National Alliance on mental illness as well as the Brady campaign now participated in strikes such as the climate strike out and we've created all these opportunities because we think it's really important to create a space thoughts open to so many different perspectives- and to have the opportunity. To gain a more holistic understanding of our community. Yeah and that's why we believe that the guidance that would be foster under having a community of compassion and having such a framework would be so important especially in the regime of you know building more supportive and compassionate communities. So in light of this initiative we've come up with a couple of ideas for tangible Paul implementation to back having this statute of the theoretical resolution. So our first idea is to integrate more hate crime prevention training within school the school curriculum- starting all the way from kindergarten up to senior year of high school. So last year actually in my junior year I'm a senior currently of I took a social justice class and one of the units that was the most impactful for me was a unit on implicit bias. And so basically what we did during that time was we took a couple of test that pinpointed specific our biases. Thought were I guess intrinsic within our perspective the I wasn't even aware about. And I think thought was a prime of moment for me in shaping and I guess I understanding where I was coming from and understanding the people around me. And so in light of that we are think side integrating more training on hate crime prevention within schools- such as activities Taylor to grade levels such as addressing stereo types in decreasing the casual integration of. Racial slurs or- name calling and students everyday vernacular that's just way too casual to be correct of would be of. Important first step to take. And we also want to emphasize the need for awareness both in our community through local events or even in libraries like through the research that we've done we found that. This violence against Pacific communities especially minority communities is gotten so common that it's become normal and as I'm sure everyone knows that this is not normal and it's not okay. And this is especially the case because individuals don't have the needed resources or access to the kind of community atmosphere that they require to have the resolutions to these. Hate crimes both in the in a workplace or even on just a regular cat colloquial level like Christy talked about- and that's why I'm gonna awareness we feel like we should have. A repeal or even a redefinition of for by which is which stands for the federal education rights and privacy act and it's- so the statue like. You to remote privacy among school communities it actually makes it's almost impossible for individuals to come forward when they have experience hate crimes and it's especially important in the school context for youth like us. Because as we've seen first hand in other schools other communities school resource officers often criminalize individuals Ashley minority youth for the most menial I'm kind of infractions. And it's this kind of legislation that prevents individuals from coming forward to talk about the violence in the communities and be able to vocalize that this is in fact not what we as a community should or need to stand for. And. We think that having this framework of having this. For compassion within California is so importance because a it's necessary to get rid of this kind of stigma for help seeking and the ability for individuals to come forward and promote. More representation both in front of. In front of audiences as well as creates a better community for everyone to feel embraced. Great thank you very much. Well to more through them from meeting high school. Please come forward. And to have any limitation on the public comment. Two minutes. Okay. Hello everyone all our names are issued by the north and mobile auger wall and- we're also from the media advocacy project on under the policy consultants for this area but so we also agree with the- compassion for the- the mandate for compassion but we believe that in order to of all this like a review and- Christie said we need to have some concrete legislation so we have a few different ideas for this so one of our ideas about per people funding so California's spending billions of dollars and recently I read on the news that Gavin Newsom is going to sign one of the biggest- federal or state mandates for education in the history of California. However something that we thought was like kind of striking was that the per pupil funding specifically is limited so what we think is that the per pupil funding should be expanded because what's going on right now is that schools aren't able to find out orange is specially cam low income schools in like low income areas aren't able to find an adequately provide the education and resources needed to foster like a safe educational learning environment so that's why we think if we increase per pupil funding that can foster a better educational environment for these children to succeed I'm and learn I'm also teachers lack the available resources in order to create search safe environment so. By increasing per pupil funding we think that these teachers will be a better able to stir such safe and environments and further different forms. Of education that a reaching Christy were talking about. So in addition another thing that believes is that school funding should not be biased towards a high income areas. However on the certain policies that are in place right now seem to be leaning towards these ideas. Currently many low income schools in areas of several students are not able to go to- school as often because they have less income. And that's why we're seeing right now that there- school absenteeism in the lower income areas are it is around In areas with our well I'm I'm Bridger hoods and so this causes a sort of a vicious cycle in which- the people who are that these people are less incentivized to go to school in the first place. Because of the fact that our current system it funds the schools based on the attendance a not the actual- enrollment in the school which means the overall less people are incentivized to go to school in the first place. Since there's less funding as the absenteeism and this creates a sort of cycle when which blessed people a less and less people go to school in these low income areas. So we believe that we should be able to stop this by making it based on enrollment. And not based on. The of the of amount of attendance in the school. So just to close off map firmly believes that the compassion a resolution should be supported and it'll be in it would play a key role in the- implementations of. Several programs throughout. The state and- you be unifying force among schools and also greeting California is one of the first compassionate states would serve as a good model not only for California but- I think for the country as well. Proving that we are compassionate and we do truly care about our neighbors and the people around us so. Thank you for your time again and- thank you. Yeah right. Thank you very much. More students for have public comment or questions. Please come forward okay your welcome to state and if you have homework to do you make sure you finish it tonight for you go to bat or- I I'm also debating you know because I know that after the presentation of my colleagues here in the dais might have some questions or comment to may or. Sure we you the time for the. Poll on the audience who I have the of quite a number of cars that. They have they have common to our country. You are you I'm I know I'm trying to get some consensus I thought this is ready if president Reagan- ready to make. We can do calm and not questions we used them and then they can do follow up after they are questions whether there. Are at least everyone gets a chance to including the public. Okay great. Okay because the way have about ten minutes left that's why I am debating. Okay let's so let's go to of public common error and before I do that I also want to recognize who wore. A president trump you haven unified school district. It was the suit Sir rob jet car Chiu most here with- heard two wonderful it's a children. So thank you very much. And this is the of I don't know in the ordered- we have- but I would like to call to media loose men from console of American Islamic group relationship care. To come for. This a similar issue in the room she's coming up. Okay and the next one I like throughout. The state and from and double ECP. To come up and you use one of. Hello I'm again my name is Salinas mon on the government relations coordinator for care thank you so much again for having this panel- on- you know the interface- community and also discussing- hate crimes- what our organization does that we provide free legal services to- people who have been facing any Islamophobic discrimination and hate crimes. School bullying law enforcement harassment and also now we're offering- immigration services as well- we have seen the new year after year- a number of cases that have come into our office almost a thousand- Acosta California of total civil rights cases- but we've also- received about a hundred and thirteen. Cases dealing specifically with hate crimes or hate incidences- and- you know people have been- we've been seeing a lot of these cases especially- so after the press or leading up to the presidential election and after the presidential election and it has- also extended into the workplace is sick Elsa extended into the schools. I'm a mom thought he had mentioned report that we just recently put out- of a survey that place of- about fifteen hundred students across California asking them what their experiences are in school and we found that again had experienced some form. Of bowling in not only from- fellow students but also from their teachers and that is really concerned so that's why we had worked with- the assembly and actually work with a- to. A two bills the safe place to learn act one that would provide- school site and online resources to deal with bowling based on one's- religious affiliation once percent relapse affiliations that passed in two thousand sixteen and also your for that so thank you so much- we also. Ask another bill in two thousand eighteen which. Would provide training for teachers on how to deal with these issues. Again you know while it's true we cannot legislate compassion we cannot legislate tolerance or whatnot. At the same time it is important to have are like to the officials. Pass these type of- you know bills or ordinances or what not and I think that this resolution the compassion resolution. Is I definitely I a big step in the right direction to ensure that we as California state that we want to have a compassionate state. And we need to work together in order to do this and so- you know I. Hope to work with you and I hope to work with them that the members of our community in order to create a more compassionate community because we can't do this alone we- do this together and we are stronger together- so what what lastly I wanted to say that- as I mentioned the reports that we had- recently put out. I'm gonna it we've already looked at a few on the table over there so please. Feel free to pick it up- and if there run out then you can also find it on our website and that's- at C.

So funny for everybody's right is our mandate. I'm we strongly support this bill because you know even though other parts of the country criticized for compassion we feel that our compassion is our strength. We have to do things together in order to survive and move ahead. We watch in horror as his hate crimes against the people of different faiths of now a different sexual orientations of different races have increase. And we had teachers who harassed in this county. We have I've had student move away because the parents could not stand the harassing to get because their muscle. I'm trying to be vehicles A. I. as a teacher you know we sometimes get carried away. Yeah we are yeah I've worked with lots of these people here a lot of familiar faces here you know. Assume the caller is from in two. This Fisher. For the big day. On issues like this yeah yeah all these great crimes a risen based on the Brewster rhetoric coming out of Washington from our so called leaders. No so the people who. Feel justified people who go on yeah. Will used to hide behind the Bible for ya to justify to hatred and bigotry you know forget about the teaching the Bible about the treatment strangers in the good Samaritan- saying Jesus will children on Sunday should but the border on Monday. Hello we feel that this resolution and other steps. A go a long way to healing the soul of our state and a and a country. We're given our strong support to it thank you thank you very much. And that's how I would- of new haven who will member the president Sir object to come up. And what's your children while great. I'm sure they have all come with some comments to make. Good evening everybody this to my grandson and you sing and is the reason for me to work with the schools and education in general and he's a kid so could you would sing and he when we were coming here I asked him on that. When he asked we really going I said that is interfere I log so he asked me if there is any Melissa committee members or you know. Who will be the at high said I don't know this is my first time so but I know there will be some good dialogue about the bullying in the schools he said that's good you know then. I don't have to worry about that. This is ten year old. So in respect of the time I will not. Keep my a common set of just testimony that this is the what we are doing for other future followed kids of and one thing I would ask from you being assembly members that more funding for the field funding for that for the schools. And the there is a restorative justice justice practices so dole's- the they had to be a funded fully so that we can train our teachers and other schools they're going to be and thank you so much for choosing this venue for the schools and I'm not forget to commend you and- stuff who invited me. To come to this for thank you so much thank you very much and thank you very much for your patience as well- next all like to call all rock then rex fans to bring a friend of mine I am very a strong advocate for the LGBTQ. Community rock fan. Thank you for this moment to address you. My name is rocks and I'm advocate for transgender women- I just want to go I recognize that we face a 100% unemployment there's not one of its employed in the legislature. And in our own legislature in Sacramento at any level. And I say that 80% of we have an 80% murder rate now I know why to define murder different because you all know about trans women getting beaten knife to killed in the street. But the factor my community is so afraid to go outside that when they do they're covered up and they do the best not to present as a trans woman. So what do they do they stay in that room. And I don't care how strong you are you can't stay in your room for ever. When you become afraid to walk out your front door. At some point you kill yourself and I think that's just society killing us the slow way. That's how we get to the 80% The death threats. It's happened to me twice in the last two years San Jose P. D. won't even show up to take a report. So and you know A. B. six fifty just got killed this year in appropriations that was Evan low's. Attempt to say that when were murdered. Were at least worth a check mark in law enforcement killed that bill so- that is the hurdle that you have to go through I own a house up in. By writing. I'm actually afraid to go up there and I'm selling my house because it's just not safe for me to go up there anymore. Info if finally I want to stress that this is not just because people think we dress funny and of our appearance this is been institutionalized hate. In the eight in fifty four cities in this state passed laws that said wearing the dress of the opposite sex. Is he went to prison. You went to jail for six months in if you can did it the second time. You are a race from society put an insane asylum for the rest of your life. So it's the imp the students talked about implicit bias and that's basically what we face I would just add a convention in Sacramento this week. A professor from UCSF which claims to know all about us. Got up and gave a lecture on empathy. But what was the example he used. It was a man wearing high heels. And he thought it was funny I don't. So I'll close in asking and addressing the audience. I know when I walk in here most of you say. Have nothing in common with trans. We what is life. One car pulls up behind this week's we steering wheel a little tighter. When we will know what it's like to judge just by our appearance. We what it's like to lose jobs not get jobs just because of our repair. And I think that goes for me communities and we would like to join you in changing. The acceptance of hate against all of this because of our parents. Thank you very much. How old were were past eight o'clock through I really like to in respect of everybody's time- I just wanted to maybe invite to more than any of further comment please feel free to contact my office or arches office or anybody. Office here so I'm just picking to randomly and I have a. Alison McDonnell Alison Huron. Good evening assembly member Kansen Chu assembly member ash Kalra. Vice mayor Koch saw one and- school board president Chris nor would I am so glad that you chose to have this event here in Milpitas- I am president of sunny hills neighborhood association and a member of the mission peak Unitarian universalist congregation and Fremont. I did not have the pleasure of attending the. The discussions that you had in Fremont about the- possibility of. Creating a homeless navigation center. Fremont is a compassionate city according to the ordinance that you pastor proclamation that you passed in Fremont and yet people I've heard through friends who were in attendance at that meeting at those meetings or saying terrible things about homeless people who for the most part are homeless because they can't afford the housing prices here. Because they can't afford the rapidly increasing runs because they may have a fixed income or disability or- a mental problem. And so my question and I think that the students actually went to some way towards some proposals that might do what I'm talking about. My question for you was. How how do we go beyond a declaration a proclamation and make it real in the community to create a change in the culture which is very order for there to truly be compassion and communities. Thank you thank you very much hello. Kellogg I've been getting some ideas from the all on the analyst and- Diane say the diss would really serve as a reminder I am definitely aware that we have a lot of work ahead of us in I would rely on your comments and your suggestions. Your recommendation as we go forward. By the way Alison I have not received your invitation to do you of the hollow in part here. Your your your problem. You promised me a have not receive it but then. Next one of the like to invite peak here Bob yeah she PJ. The drummer. The tight hole frontier. Hello all thank you so much for our convening here and this is something that I advocating for years myself but I just wanted to bring to of. My name is PJ hereby actually. And I'm a founder activator of. East Akron act I'm for tylko Japanese. Partnerships and the sea and creative power meant. I am also a founding member and charter member of San Jose tackle forty six years in the making. Anyway I I'd like to just bring to your attention as an artist. There is a strong and growing group. As that's creating a movement called coalition of artists and creative for passionate communities. And it's through. We've in spirituality activism art. We feel that the arts is essential tool. Compassionate community building and its partnerships who share principles of empathy and empowerment by voice and visibility through creative expression. Please note arc our communities are real Eddie for this movement. And it has to happen here in California regarded as radical but let's show. That we are actually a model- for progressive compassionate change. Thank you PJ no I haven't survey after the committee chair of the state assembly our entertainment sports tourism media tech OG. I am very happy por last your idea of advocates for ten million dollar more true California arts council who there some money there you know but a part of the money would actually of dedicated for to California prison all make sure that this- people that incarcerated has an opportunity. To express themselves through art and use our the as the as part of their healing so was stellar I would like to open up the microphone of the- on the d√≠as an ashram will go first yeah I'll all in the end so much of the almost peak fast which I you know all you know I can do- and- I want to thank all the panelists I mean really. Like I said is an all star group of folks are so committed to the community and really exemplifies what we need to spread. More I think we're very blessed to represent the community that we deal we certainly have a lot of problems but we have a lot of compassion as well it does make it a bit of a mention. Of but what I am trying to with the legislating compassion I do think a very proud to be a co author almost always think that you need to state your intention because your intentions in your thoughts leader actions. Well I absolutely. Masters like the but this Hindu and us kind of manifesting itself to legislation in some sense but I think that each and everyone of you in some matter. Reflected that right that is the of the way you think of when you treat others. The way the US your spiritual your thoughts- always come for your actions anyway. This expanded health care to. Undocumented the residents letter twenty six that is legislating compassion. Right and that's a very real action. Of that goes beyond the words there's plenty of things that we can do as a what I would. Ask in but kind of in my- comments- is. Bob as father job deferring to an and a couple others well- me obstruction to locked up in cages we have children being away from their parents. I that we need to show our actions are cash to actions of standing up is families. We are homelessness as was mentioned actuation Fremont I've heard the same thing as house elves a Cupertino Paul to. You know everyone has compassion but then when there's a when it comes to doing something about it in your own backyard people show up and many of those people are in your congregations. On the weekends or during the course of the week. And so we need to do what a better job myself absolutely first online included- job really articulate that. Not just about how we pray or who we pray to- but how do we actually act upon that believe that faith and that means standing up for our how. How's community as vigorously as compassionately as possible- are incarcerated and informally incarcerated those getting released people get worried sometimes also be released well the best way to make sure. Of that- that there's no harm because is to embrace them and bring them back into the community and to love them. And I think that. That is what I. Lots legislating compassion and is also demonstrating compassion through our actions and I think also you. It's a very tough last comment on makes a very tough place- to live very expensive a lot of people working really hard are struggling to survive. Some are are homeless or very close to it- somewhere but clear our bathroom summer serving our food- and- there are a lot of people struggling back right now and I see some of the teachers reading- wearing red is about to teachers striking and- school workers striking in. Chicago and I just wanna make mention of the workers in the plot the workers again I think that we must do you can up left everyone. Especially those are struggling to make ends meet and ends up. As we beat. Up were as the feet of the homeless and on housing that's and ways to by the way to put them as well. As as well as that physical nourishment the spiritual nourishment and that activism that of that- all of our face the can down. Straight through action and so on this very hopeful being here- in and not just hearing to live for the folks the audience but- our panelists and so I think that. Plenty of cause of action. That that we can take up. And I know that there's nothing we can't achieve of fighting all that. The hatred and bullying and bigotry fighting it with the love that I see a is unstoppable and so I want to thank all of you. Right thank you all. And large. Thank you symbol member for a hosting this important discussion and also they can assembly member Kalra for signing on this- resolution. A special thanks all the panelists everybody who came out today. It was interesting that almost all of used almost very similar if you look at the key principles. And again goes back to the golden rule you know treat others the way you want to be treated. And so I felt that- you know what you like this is a greater than what divide this and we are the human race and- we have so much to- in common- the speaker mention about compassionate Fremont. I was a great charter and everybody bought it to it until it can be implementing it. And to live out the can. Values when we had the home navigate to center. We had a lot of ugliness that came out. And I made a quote that you know everybody wants to help the homeless but just on doing your me. And so we have to live those principles and so in Fremont we did end up- unanimously. Voting for that. Hello yes thank you. Although I like to say we use one what political lives on that. And so now it's up to us to prove that this will six will concept and to make sure that we are the trust of the community. And hopefully with time the committee will come to see it- we had fights like this previously I when it came to four wheel housing it was the same thing people audit fought it. And then now the champion it so I think the same will happen with these. Centers so I'm hopeful that we can all come together- it you know for the greater good. And that support this effort that up symbol members leading I think this is the right thing and I think California is compassion state and we need to make sure to let everybody know that. Thank you. All right. Your to five final word down trying to see if the community of Milpitas could speak if we could get a little support if you have access to the internet. On the laptop. Superintendent is helping her bill. You have a slide show the little too many the element of the deal all right.
