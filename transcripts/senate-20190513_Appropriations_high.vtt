VERY PERSONAL TO ME TWENTY YEARS

00:20:20.819 --> 00:20:22.120
AGO I HEARD THE THREE WORDS AND

00:20:22.187 --> 00:20:23.155
NOBODY EVER WANTS TO HEAR.

00:20:23.221 --> 00:20:24.323
YOU HAVE CANCER.

00:20:24.389 --> 00:20:24.957
YEARS LATER WHEN I WAS SERVING

00:20:25.023 --> 00:20:25.424
AS AN ASSEMBLY MEMBER

00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:26.425
CONSTITUENT CAME FOR WITH A

00:20:26.491 --> 00:20:27.259
STORY ABOUT BEING CONTRACT

00:20:27.326 --> 00:20:28.160
CONTACTED.

00:20:28.226 --> 00:20:29.227
BY A RESEARCHER BEFORE SHE'D

00:20:29.294 --> 00:20:30.329
EVEN DECIDED TO TELL HER FAMILY

00:20:30.395 --> 00:20:31.597
ABOUT HER DIAGNOSIS OF CANCER.

00:20:31.663 --> 00:20:33.632
SHE WAS FURIOUS SHE HAD NO IDEA

00:20:33.699 --> 00:20:34.866
HOW THE RESEARCHER GOT HER

00:20:34.933 --> 00:20:36.468
INFORMATION BECAUSE SHEWAS

00:20:36.535 --> 00:20:38.704
UNAWARE THAT THE CANCER REGISTRY

00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:40.272
EVEN EXISTED.

00:20:40.339 --> 00:20:42.574
ALONG THAT HELD HER PERSONAL AND

00:20:42.641 --> 00:20:43.909
MEDICAL INFORMATION.

00:20:43.976 --> 00:20:46.345
I WAS SURPRISED TOO BECAUSE AS A

00:20:46.411 --> 00:20:47.613
CANCER SURVIVOR MYSELF I WAS

00:20:47.679 --> 00:20:49.181
ALSO AWARE OF THE REGISTRIES

00:20:49.247 --> 00:20:51.149
EXISTENCE.

00:20:51.216 --> 00:20:52.484
AS I DUG FURTHER INTO THE ISSUE

00:20:52.551 --> 00:20:54.119
I REALIZE IS ACTUALLY A

00:20:54.186 --> 00:20:55.120
STATEWIDE ISSUE.

00:20:55.187 --> 00:20:56.688
THAT I BELIEVE THE LEGISLATURE

00:20:56.755 --> 00:20:57.856
NEEDS TO ADDRESS.

00:20:57.923 --> 00:20:59.124
THE CURRENT VERSION OF THIS BILL

00:20:59.191 --> 00:21:00.626
ALLOWS FLEXIBILITY FOR THE

00:21:00.692 --> 00:21:01.960
DEPARTMENT IN AN ATTEMPT TO

00:21:02.027 --> 00:21:03.495
ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT. TO PICK

00:21:03.562 --> 00:21:05.197
THE MOST EFFECTIVE METHOD OF

00:21:05.263 --> 00:21:06.398
GETTING THE INFORMATIONAL

00:21:06.465 --> 00:21:08.567
BROCHURES. TO THE INDIVIDUALS

00:21:08.634 --> 00:21:10.235
ADDED TO THE REGISTRY.

00:21:10.302 --> 00:21:11.737
UNFORTUNATELY I DO NOT AGREE

00:21:11.803 --> 00:21:13.138
WITH THE COSTS ESTIMATED BY THE

00:21:13.205 --> 00:21:14.673
DEPARTMENT.

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:16.942
THE LARGE VARIANCE IN COST FROM

00:21:17.009 --> 00:21:18.143
ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS TO

00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:19.578
ONE POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS.

00:21:19.645 --> 00:21:20.712
BASED ON THE FACT THAT THE BILL

00:21:20.779 --> 00:21:23.682
IS AMBIGUOUS IS UNREALISTIC IN

00:21:23.749 --> 00:21:25.951
FACT THIS SOME BIG AMBIGUITY

00:21:26.018 --> 00:21:27.185
SHOULD HELP LOWER THE COST

00:21:27.252 --> 00:21:28.887
BECAUSE UNDER THE CURRENT BILL.

00:21:28.954 --> 00:21:30.188
THE TO THE DEPARTMENT CAN EVEN

00:21:30.255 --> 00:21:33.158
CHOOSE TO UTILIZE EMAIL RATHER

00:21:33.225 --> 00:21:34.259
THAN STANDARD MAIL.

00:21:34.326 --> 00:21:35.560
ADDITIONALLY THE DEPARTMENT

00:21:35.627 --> 00:21:37.229
CLAIMS THAT THEY WILL NEED TO

00:21:37.295 --> 00:21:39.097
ADD EXTRA DATA FIELDS TO THEIR

00:21:39.164 --> 00:21:40.332
SYSTEM IN ORDER TO SEND THESE

00:21:40.399 --> 00:21:41.433
BROCHURES OUT.

00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:43.468
HOWEVER THE REGISTRY ALREADY

00:21:43.535 --> 00:21:47.572
COLLECTS ADDRESSES BECAUSE THEY-PROVIDE THEM TO THE RESEARCHERS

00:21:47.639 --> 00:21:48.940
TO CONTACT THE INDIVIDUALS ON

00:21:49.007 --> 00:21:50.308
THE REGISTRY.

00:21:50.375 --> 00:21:52.377
FINALLY AT THE REGISTRY FILLS

00:21:52.444 --> 00:21:53.679
THEY'RE GOING TO NEED TO

00:21:53.745 --> 00:21:56.014
ADDITIONAL STAFFERS JUST TO

00:21:56.081 --> 00:21:57.783
HANDLE THE CALL BY VOLUME FROM

00:21:57.849 --> 00:21:58.850
THE NOTIFICATIONS.

00:21:58.917 --> 00:22:00.619
WELL I THINK THAT SPEAKS TO THE

00:22:00.686 --> 00:22:01.853
NEED OF THE BILL.

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:03.388
YOU SHOULDN'T BE FINDING OUT

00:22:03.455 --> 00:22:05.590
ABOUT THE AGE CANCER SURVIVOR

00:22:05.657 --> 00:22:06.992
SHOULD NOT BE FINDING OUT ABOUT

00:22:07.059 --> 00:22:08.694
THE REGISTRIES EXISTENCE WHEN

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:09.661
YOU'RE BEING ASKED TO

00:22:09.728 --> 00:22:11.596

YOUR INFORMATION IS ENTERED.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.535
MAYBE IF PATIENTS ARE NOTIFIED

00:22:16.601 --> 00:22:17.769
EARLIER IN THE PROCESS THEY

00:22:17.836 --> 00:22:19.204
WON'T BE AS SHOCKED TO FIND OUT

00:22:19.271 --> 00:22:21.239
ABOUT THE REGISTRY.

00:22:21.306 --> 00:22:22.240
I THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT

00:22:22.307 --> 00:22:23.975
BILL I LOOK FORWARD TO THE TO

00:22:24.042 --> 00:22:25.377
THE CHANGE TO CONTINUE WORKING

00:22:25.444 --> 00:22:26.611
WITH THE DEPARTMENT.

00:22:26.678 --> 00:22:28.580
AND AT THE TIME APPROPRIATE I

00:22:28.647 --> 00:22:30.315
ASK YOUR AYE VOTE.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU

MISTER JONES ANYBODY IN SUPPORT

00:22:33.785 --> 00:22:34.553
OF THIS BILL [inaudible]

00:22:34.619 --> 00:22:37.656
ANY OPPOSITION.

00:22:37.723 --> 00:22:51.536
AND ONE PERSON COMING UP

00:22:51.603 --> 00:22:51.837
[inaudible]

00:22:51.903 --> 00:22:53.271
THIS YEAR.

00:22:53.338 --> 00:22:54.072
THE AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY

00:22:54.139 --> 00:22:54.873
CANCER ACTION NETWORK AND

00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:56.108
UNFORTUNATELY WE ARE STILL

00:22:56.174 --> 00:22:57.409
OPPOSED TO THIS BILL.

00:22:57.476 --> 00:23:00.378
WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS.

00:23:00.445 --> 00:23:01.580
THIS IS A DOCTOR PATIENT

00:23:01.646 --> 00:23:04.282
RELATIONSHIP ISSUE WE THINK THAT

00:23:04.349 --> 00:23:04.583
IT'S BEST.

00:23:04.649 --> 00:23:06.384
THE PATIENT LEARN ABOUT THE

00:23:06.451 --> 00:23:07.919
REGISTRY THROUGH THE TO THE

00:23:07.986 --> 00:23:09.354
DOCTOR AS IT'S CURRENTLY

00:23:09.421 --> 00:23:10.322
SUPPOSED TO BE.

00:23:10.388 --> 00:23:11.590
AND WE'RE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT

00:23:11.656 --> 00:23:14.259
THE METHOD PROPOSED IN THIS BILL.

00:23:14.326 --> 00:23:16.428
THE REGISTRY IS ON A SIGNIFICANT

00:23:16.495 --> 00:23:18.530
DELAY AND BY THE TIME THAT THE

00:23:18.597 --> 00:23:22.634
MAIN REGISTRY GETS THE PAMPHLET

00:23:22.701 --> 00:23:23.235
ARE THE INFORMATION ABOUT THE

00:23:23.301 --> 00:23:24.035
PATIENTS.

00:23:24.102 --> 00:23:24.536
IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THE

00:23:24.603 --> 00:23:25.637
RESEARCHERS WILL ALREADY REACHED

00:23:25.704 --> 00:23:27.506
OUT BEFORE THEY GET THE

00:23:27.572 --> 00:23:29.007
PAMPHLETS OUT TO THE PATIENTS.

00:23:29.074 --> 00:23:31.209
AND SO WE THINK THAT THEIR NEEDS

00:23:31.276 --> 00:23:32.811
TO BE A FIX TO THE REGISTRY.

00:23:32.878 --> 00:23:34.946
AND AND THAT THERE'S A DIFFERENT

00:23:35.013 --> 00:23:37.149
WAY TO ADDRESS THIS TO STILL GET

00:23:37.215 --> 00:23:38.183
TO HAVE GUESTS REAL CONCERNS --

00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:39.417
WE DO WE THINK THAT THIS WILL BE

00:23:39.484 --> 00:23:41.920
A VERY COSTLY WAY TO HAVE THIS

00:23:41.987 --> 00:23:43.421
ADDRESS AGAIN IF IT'S A DRESS

00:23:43.488 --> 00:23:44.055
THE WAY THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE

00:23:44.122 --> 00:23:45.757
WITH THE DOCTOR PATIENT

00:23:45.824 --> 00:23:46.625
RELATIONSHIP.

00:23:46.691 --> 00:23:48.760
THEN THERE'S NO COST TO THE

00:23:48.827 --> 00:23:49.995
STATE IT'S ALREADY.

00:23:50.061 --> 00:23:51.263
BUT THE PAMPHLETS WILL BE A VERY

00:23:51.329 --> 00:23:53.598
COSTLY WAY TO GET THAT

00:23:53.665 --> 00:23:55.133
INFORMATION OUT.

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:57.035
ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION.

00:23:57.102 --> 00:24:00.806
FINANCE NO FILE.

00:24:00.872 --> 00:24:02.874
WHICH JONES WOULD YOU LIKE.

00:24:02.941 --> 00:24:04.242

00:24:04.309 --> 00:24:04.910
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AS A

00:24:04.976 --> 00:24:05.777

PATIENT RELATIONSHIP IS VERY

00:24:06.578 --> 00:24:08.013
IMPORTANT AND I BELIEVE THAT

00:24:08.079 --> 00:24:12.250
THAT'S PART OF THE REASON WHY --

00:24:12.317 --> 00:24:13.718
LOTS OF CANCER PATIENTS ARE

00:24:13.785 --> 00:24:15.453
RECEIVING THE INFORMATION OR

00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:16.688
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY HAVE

00:24:16.755 --> 00:24:18.089
RECEIVED INFORMATION BECAUSE

00:24:18.156 --> 00:24:19.658
IT'S COMING AT A TIME WHEN

00:24:19.724 --> 00:24:20.659
THEY'RE BEING BOMBARDED WITH

00:24:20.725 --> 00:24:22.460
LOTS OF OTHER INFORMATION.

00:24:22.527 --> 00:24:24.062
OR THE DOCTORS ARE.

00:24:24.129 --> 00:24:25.197
HE YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE DEALING

00:24:25.263 --> 00:24:26.798
WITH CANCER YOU HAVE SEVERAL

00:24:26.865 --> 00:24:28.400
DOCTORS THAT ARE PROVIDING YOUR

00:24:28.466 --> 00:24:30.168
CARE AND EACH DOCTOR MAY NOT

00:24:30.235 --> 00:24:31.403
KNOW.

00:24:31.469 --> 00:24:31.937
MAYBE EXPECTING THE OTHER

00:24:32.003 --> 00:24:33.572
DOCTORS TO DO IT WHICH I THINK

00:24:33.638 --> 00:24:35.307
WAS THE CASE IN MY CASE --

00:24:35.373 --> 00:24:38.043

THIS IS ALL TO DEAL WITH A VERY

SMALL NUMBER BUT UNKNOWN NUMBER

ANOTHER STATED GOAL OF THIS BILL

01:41:36.056 --> 01:41:37.291
IS TO REDUCE THE POCKETS WHERE

BUT BECAUSE CHILDREN ARE OVERDUE

01:41:55.309 --> 01:41:56.276
WITH THAT VACCINATIONS OR
