BRIEF HISTORY. OF A LITTLE BIT

00:31:45.136 --> 00:31:46.504
A THE STATE OF THE ART IN.

00:31:46.571 --> 00:31:49.540
RECENT ADVANCES IN CHALLENGES

00:31:49.607 --> 00:31:51.676

RECOGNITION. SO I SHOW YOU A

00:31:54.746 --> 00:31:56.581
PICTURE ON ON A SCREEN OR

00:31:56.648 --> 00:31:59.017
FISCAL PICTURE WHATEVER- YOU

00:31:59.083 --> 00:32:00.918
CAN VERY QUICKLY TELL ME. THERE

00:32:00.985 --> 00:32:02.754

WHERE THE FACES HOW LARGE THEY

00:32:11.529 --> 00:32:13.865
ARE YOU CAN MAYBE SAY. WHAT THE

00:32:13.931 --> 00:32:15.099
SEX OF THE PEOPLE ARE

00:32:15.166 --> 00:32:17.402
APPROXIMATE AGES ALL KINDS OF

00:32:17.468 --> 00:32:19.137
THINGS ABOUT THIS PEOPLE IN AN

00:32:19.203 --> 00:32:20.938
IMAGE- YOU'VE SEEN. THOSE

00:32:21.005 --> 00:32:22.640
PEOPLE BEFORE YOU PROBABLY GIVE

00:32:22.707 --> 00:32:24.075
THE IDENTITY OF THE PEOPLE IN

00:32:24.142 --> 00:32:25.843
THE IMAGE. YOU WOULD HAVE A

00:32:25.910 --> 00:32:27.679
LITTLE MORE PROBLEM THOUGH IF

00:32:27.745 --> 00:32:30.181
THE PICTURE WAS VERY DARK WERE

00:32:30.248 --> 00:32:34.619
FOR FACE WORK. WERE FIFTY IS

00:32:34.686 --> 00:32:38.890
WERE UP SO DOWN. STREAM CAN

00:32:38.956 --> 00:32:40.892
CURATE. UP PLACES WE SOME IN

00:32:40.958 --> 00:32:43.294
THE IN YOUR WAS VERY LOW RESIN

00:32:43.361 --> 00:32:44.862
OR PAUL. MAJOR TOM THING THE

00:32:44.929 --> 00:32:46.264
PERSON WEARING ON. THIS IS

00:32:46.331 --> 00:32:47.799
SCOTT EYES THEIR LOT OF

00:32:47.865 --> 00:32:48.399
CHALLENGE TO FACE RECOGNITION

00:32:48.466 --> 00:32:50.068
IS SOMETHING THAT WE AS HUMANS

00:32:50.134 --> 00:32:52.503
DO VERY EASILY AND QUICKLY YOU

00:32:52.570 --> 00:32:54.472
DON'T HAVE TO THINK ABOUT. BUT

00:32:54.539 --> 00:32:56.407
IT'S A QUITE A CHALLENGE TO GET

00:32:56.474 --> 00:33:01.112
IN THE IN TO DO IT. SO THE GOAL

00:33:01.179 --> 00:33:10.922
OF ALL. FACE CAN IS TO. IS OF

00:33:10.988 --> 00:33:13.858
THE- MACHINE. GIVE THE CHOICE

00:33:13.925 --> 00:33:16.427
THE IDEA. OF THAT. LOS THIS IN

00:33:16.494 --> 00:33:19.297
MAY TO DO FOR THOSE OF THINGS

00:33:19.364 --> 00:33:23.034
TO ME. SURE TO EXPRESS. IN THIS.

00:33:23.101 --> 00:33:30.908
THINGS YOU ABLE TO. WIN FROM.

00:33:30.975 --> 00:33:32.977
RECOGNITIONS IT IS IDENTITY WHO

00:33:33.044 --> 00:33:34.145
IS THAT PERSON CAN WE TELL WHO

00:33:34.212 --> 00:33:36.514
THAT PERSON IS. AND THAT SYSTEM

00:33:36.581 --> 00:33:38.149
CAN BE FULLY AUTONOMOUS THEY

00:33:38.216 --> 00:33:40.385
CAN MAKE THAT DECISION ITSELF

00:33:40.451 --> 00:33:41.953
AND MAYBE DO SOMETHING BASED ON

00:33:42.019 --> 00:33:43.888
THAT DECISION- AWARD COULD

00:33:43.955 --> 00:33:45.957
ACTUALLY PROVIDE INFORMATION TO

00:33:46.023 --> 00:33:48.726
GIVE TO A PERSON. LIKE I HAVE

00:33:48.793 --> 00:33:50.595
75% CERTAINTY THAT THISIS

00:33:50.661 --> 00:33:53.564
PERCENT. OR IT'S ONE OF THESE

00:33:53.631 --> 00:33:54.766
FIVE PEOPLE MOST LIKELY OR

00:33:54.832 --> 00:33:56.100
SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND THEN

00:33:56.167 --> 00:33:58.636
PEOPLE CAN THEN MAKE DECISIONS-

00:33:58.703 --> 00:34:00.872
BASED ON THAT. SO FACE

00:34:00.938 --> 00:34:02.940
RECOGNITION IS A PART OF THE

00:34:03.007 --> 00:34:04.542
FIELD THAT'S CALLED COMPUTER

00:34:04.609 --> 00:34:07.545
VISION SO MAKING COMPUTERS HE-

00:34:07.612 --> 00:34:08.846
OR IN SOME CASES AB BETTER THAN

00:34:08.913 --> 00:34:11.015
PEOPLE SEE. COMPUTER VISION HAS

00:34:11.082 --> 00:34:13.785
A FIFTY SIX YEAR OLD HISTORY.

00:34:13.851 --> 00:34:15.686
IT'S USED CURRENTLY IN THINGS

00:34:15.753 --> 00:34:16.988
LIKE DRIVER ASSISTANCE

00:34:17.054 --> 00:34:18.856

THINGS- AND THIS IS GENERALLY

00:34:32.303 --> 00:34:33.771
INTELLIGENCE SO WHEN WE TALK

00:34:33.838 --> 00:34:34.939
ABOUT FACE RECOGNITION SORT OF

00:34:35.006 --> 00:34:37.008
A SUB SUB AREA OF ARTIFICIAL

00:34:37.074 --> 00:34:38.409
INTELLIGENCE. IT'S ALSO

00:34:38.476 --> 00:34:40.044
RELATED- AS WAS MENTIONED

00:34:40.111 --> 00:34:41.412
EARLIER TO THIS AREA CALLED

DISCIPLINE HAS A LOT IN COMMON

00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:07.972
WITH BIOMETRICS OVERLAPS WITH

00:35:08.039 --> 00:35:09.874
BIOMETRIC SPEND BUT CAN BE

00:35:09.941 --> 00:35:12.043
QUITE DIFFERENT TIMES TO. SO

00:35:12.109 --> 00:35:13.578
HERE'S A SLIDE TO GIVE YOU A

THINGS IN THE FAMILY OF FACE

00:35:18.716 --> 00:35:20.785
PROCESSING TECHNOLOGIES SO ON

00:35:20.852 --> 00:35:22.987
THE LEFT COLUMN YOU HAVE A FEW

00:35:23.054 --> 00:35:24.889
IMAGES ASSOCIATED WITH FACE

00:35:24.956 --> 00:35:27.191
DETECTION THAT IS. OUR THEIR

00:35:27.258 --> 00:35:29.060
FACES IN THOSE IMAGES CAN WE

00:35:29.126 --> 00:35:30.928
FIND THEM AND IDENTIFY WHERE

00:35:30.995 --> 00:35:32.330
THEY ARE IN THE APPROXIMATE

00:35:32.396 --> 00:35:33.998
SIZE OF THE FACE AND ALL THAT

AND AS YOU CAN SEE. THAT CAN BE

00:35:35.666 --> 00:35:37.201
DONE POTENTIALLY IN A VIDEO

GIVEN A FACE. CAN WE BUILD SOME

00:35:50.014 --> 00:35:51.549
KIND OF MODEL OF THAT FACE

00:35:51.616 --> 00:35:53.284
MAYBE IT'S A TWO DIMENSIONAL OR

00:35:53.351 --> 00:35:54.352
THREE DIMENSIONAL MODEL MAY BE

00:35:54.418 --> 00:35:56.621

THEM. CLIP BECAUSE IT'S

00:36:13.971 --> 00:36:15.873
MODELING FACE KNOWING WHERE TO

00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:17.642
PUT THAT KIND OF THING. THE

00:36:17.708 --> 00:36:18.910
THIRD COLUMN IS FACIAL

00:36:18.976 --> 00:36:21.312
EXPRESSION ANALYSIS SO- PEOPLE

00:36:21.379 --> 00:36:23.180
WORK ON UNDERSTANDING THE FACE

00:36:23.247 --> 00:36:25.349
AND MOTIONS OF THE FACE. TO GET

00:36:25.416 --> 00:36:27.618
A SENSE OF HOW IS THE FACE

00:36:27.685 --> 00:36:29.353
CONFIGURED AT DIFFERENT TIMES

00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:31.622
BASED ON DIFFERENT EXPRESSIONS

00:36:31.689 --> 00:36:32.456
YOU MIGHT MAKE- HER LEFT

00:36:32.523 --> 00:36:34.559
EYEBROW MIGHT BE RAISED.

00:36:34.625 --> 00:36:38.429
PERCENT BE SMILING FOR IN EVER.

PRIMARILY HERE TO TALK ABOUT

00:36:41.666 --> 00:36:43.334
FACE RECOGNITION AND THE

00:36:43.401 --> 00:36:44.969
RELATED SUBSET OF THAT CALL

00:36:45.036 --> 00:36:46.938
FACE VERIFICATION. IN THE TOP

00:36:47.004 --> 00:36:48.773
RIGHT SOMEONE IS BASICALLY

00:36:48.839 --> 00:36:50.174

VERIFICATION YES OR NO. ON THE

00:36:58.583 --> 00:37:00.084
BOTTOM RIGHT THERE'S AN IMAGE

00:37:00.151 --> 00:37:02.386
AND THAT PERSON. WHO'S RED

00:37:02.453 --> 00:37:04.155
BOXES AROUND HER FACE SHE COULD

00:37:04.221 --> 00:37:06.357
BE ONE OF HUNDREDS DOZENS

00:37:06.424 --> 00:37:07.758
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE SO THAT'S

00:37:07.825 --> 00:37:08.893
FACE RECOGNITION TRYING TO

00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:11.095
FIGURE OUT WHO OF MANY POSSIBLE

00:37:11.162 --> 00:37:14.632
PEOPLE IS THIS PERSON. SO ALL

00:37:14.699 --> 00:37:15.533
OF THESE ARE ARE INVOLVED IN

00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:17.234
THE FAMILY FACE PROCESSING

00:37:17.301 --> 00:37:19.203
ANALOGIES BUT IT'S THE FAR

00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:20.605
RIGHT THAT WERE PRIMARILY

00:37:20.671 --> 00:37:23.541
CONCERNED WITH BUT MAY USE

00:37:23.608 --> 00:37:29.213
ASPECT THE- ALMOST AS WELL. SO

00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:32.350
HOW FACE SYSTEMS ACOMPLISH.

00:37:32.416 --> 00:37:34.118
AND THAT'S A OF ABLACK AND

00:37:34.185 --> 00:37:36.654
WHITE OR COLOR IMAGE- OR MAYBE

00:37:36.721 --> 00:37:38.289
A VIDEO WHICH IS JUST A BUNCH

00:37:38.356 --> 00:37:41.559
OF IMAGES- MAYBE THIRTY SIXTY

00:37:41.626 --> 00:37:43.027
HUNDRED PER SECOND IT COULD BE

00:37:43.094 --> 00:37:45.329
MULTI VIEW IMAGERY LIKE TWO OR

00:37:45.396 --> 00:37:47.932
MORE CAMERAS MAKING IT SO FACE.

00:37:47.999 --> 00:37:49.967
BE A RED IMAGE LOW IN FOR YOUR

00:37:50.034 --> 00:37:52.203
NEAR INFRARED IT COULD BE A

00:37:52.269 --> 00:37:53.838
DEATH IMAGE FROM VARIOUS

00:37:53.904 --> 00:37:55.206
TECHNOLOGIES OF IN DEPTH

00:37:55.272 --> 00:37:57.808
INSTEAD OF INTENSITIES AND

00:37:57.875 --> 00:37:58.776
OTHERS OR SO COULD BE A

00:37:58.843 --> 00:38:02.780
COMBINATION OF THINGS. SO IN

00:38:02.847 --> 00:38:04.448
EMERGES IF WE SEE THE TOP LEFT

00:38:04.515 --> 00:38:05.149
SO THERE'S A IMAGE OF PEOPLE

00:38:05.216 --> 00:38:07.551
HAVE COFFEE. AND THE YELLOW BOX

00:38:07.618 --> 00:38:10.087
THERE IS THEN SHOWN TO THE

00:38:10.154 --> 00:38:11.789
RIGHT AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT

00:38:11.856 --> 00:38:13.257
THE COMPUTER SEASON THAT YELLOW

00:38:13.324 --> 00:38:15.860
BOX THE COMPUTER HAS A BUNCH OF

00:38:15.926 --> 00:38:18.229
NUMBERS. NUMBER A REPRESENTING

00:38:18.295 --> 00:38:20.998
INTENSITIES AND COLORS IN THAT

00:38:21.065 --> 00:38:23.367
PARTICULAR BOX IN THE LARGER

00:38:23.434 --> 00:38:26.037
IMAGE. SO THERE THERE'S BASE

00:38:26.103 --> 00:38:27.505
RATE FIRST THERE'S THREE

00:38:27.571 --> 00:38:29.573
NUMBERS THERE'S- NUMBERS THE

00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:32.109
COPPER RGB. THAT LITTLE SEARCH

00:38:32.176 --> 00:38:35.379
NUMBER. SHOWING THE VALUE

00:38:35.446 --> 00:38:36.013
BEHIND IT OR GREEN AND BLUE THE

00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:39.083
AS WELL. SO THOSE THOSE LARGE

00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:40.651
LARGE MATRICES OF NUMBERS

00:38:40.718 --> 00:38:42.420
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS PERHAPS

00:38:42.486 --> 00:38:44.155
SEVERAL MILLION NUMBERS ARE

00:38:44.221 --> 00:38:45.656
BEING FED INTO A COMPUTER TO

00:38:45.723 --> 00:38:47.692
REPRESENT THAT SINGLE IMAGE SO

00:38:47.758 --> 00:38:49.293
THE COMPUTERS JOB IS TO TAKE

00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:51.062
THAT LARGE ARRAY OF NUMBERS.

00:38:51.128 --> 00:38:53.097
AND FIGURE OUT POTENTIALLY IS

00:38:53.164 --> 00:38:55.199
THERE A FACE THERE WHO IS THAT

00:38:55.266 --> 00:38:57.101
PERSON SO IT IT'S A COMPLICATED

00:38:57.168 --> 00:38:58.602
PROBLEM. AND SEE A PERSON'S

00:38:58.669 --> 00:39:00.771
FACE AN ARRAY OF NUMBERS AND

00:39:00.838 --> 00:39:02.740
PROBABLY YOU CAN EITHER BUT THE

00:39:02.807 --> 00:39:04.575
TASK IS TO MAKE A COMPUTER DO

00:39:04.642 --> 00:39:06.410
THAT. SO THERE ARE LOTS%

00:39:06.477 --> 00:39:08.245
CHALLENGES IN DOING THAT WE

00:39:08.312 --> 00:39:10.147
CAN'T JUST TAKE THOSE NUBERS

00:39:10.214 --> 00:39:12.516
AND COMPARE TO ANOTHER SET OF

00:39:12.583 --> 00:39:15.352
NUMBERS AND SEE IS THAT. OR NOT

00:39:15.419 --> 00:39:16.353
THAT JUST DOES NOT WORK IN THE

00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:18.456
REASON IS THOSE NUMBERS ARE SO

00:39:18.522 --> 00:39:20.491
DEPENDENT ON MANY DIFFERENT

00:39:20.558 --> 00:39:22.860
FACTORS ON THE EXPRESSION THE

00:39:22.927 --> 00:39:24.095
FACIAL EXPRESSION OF THE

00:39:24.161 --> 00:39:25.629
PEOPLE. ON THE WAITING OF THE

00:39:25.696 --> 00:39:26.864
ENVIRONMENT ON THEIR HEAD

00:39:26.931 --> 00:39:28.499
ORIENTATIONS WHERE THEY'RE

00:39:28.566 --> 00:39:31.569
LOOKING. ON ON THEIR AGE ON ON

00:39:31.635 --> 00:39:32.870
A CLINICIANS MAYBE SOMEBODY'S

00:39:32.937 --> 00:39:34.605
WEARING SUNGLASSES A BASEBALL

00:39:34.672 --> 00:39:37.475
CAP- ON THE QUALITY OF THE

00:39:37.541 --> 00:39:41.445
IMAGE ON THEIR THEIR HAIR STYLE

00:39:41.512 --> 00:39:43.047
THEIR FACIAL. ALL KINDS OF.

00:39:43.114 --> 00:39:44.548
GOOD DETERMINING THOSE LARGER.

00:39:44.615 --> 00:39:46.584
NUMBERS AND IT'S AWESOME TO

00:39:46.650 --> 00:39:49.053
JUST TO MATCH THE NUMBER. SOME

00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:50.988
SENSE. SO WE HAVE A LOT OF

00:39:51.055 --> 00:39:52.957
CHALLENGES- IN TERMS OF

00:39:53.023 --> 00:39:54.625
CHANGING EXPRESSION CHANGING

00:39:54.692 --> 00:39:57.328
LIGHTING. CHANGING HEAD

00:39:57.394 --> 00:39:59.430
ORIENTATION WHERE SOMEONE'S

00:39:59.497 --> 00:40:00.131
LOOKING FOR THE RESPECT TO A

00:40:00.197 --> 00:40:02.399
CAMERA CHANGING AGE ON ON THE

00:40:02.466 --> 00:40:03.734
TOP RIGHT THERE ARE SEVERAL

00:40:03.801 --> 00:40:05.636
IMAGES OF THE SAME PERSON OVER

00:40:05.703 --> 00:40:08.506
DECADES OF HER LIFE- IN IN

00:40:08.572 --> 00:40:10.908
VARIOUS WAYS OF INCLUDING FACES

00:40:10.975 --> 00:40:12.209
THESE ALL POSE VERY VERY

00:40:12.276 --> 00:40:13.911
SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS TO FACE

00:40:13.978 --> 00:40:15.312
RECOGNITION AND TO ANY THOUGHT

00:40:15.379 --> 00:40:17.648
OF TAKING THAT LARGE LARGE

00:40:17.715 --> 00:40:19.316
ARRAY OF NUMBERS. IN MAKING

00:40:19.383 --> 00:40:21.585
SOME SENSE OUT OF IT SO THAT'S

00:40:21.652 --> 00:40:23.020
KIND OF THE PROBLEM IN A REALLY

00:40:23.087 --> 00:40:26.390
REALLY HIGH LEVEL SO INSTEAD OF

00:40:26.457 --> 00:40:28.993
TAKING THE IMAGE OF ONE OF

00:40:29.059 --> 00:40:31.629
THOSE AND JUST. BRING IT TO HIM

00:40:31.695 --> 00:40:34.131
OF ME. PEOPLE KEEP FACE RECKON

00:40:34.198 --> 00:40:36.267
SYSTEM THE WHAT'S IMPORTANT IN

00:40:36.333 --> 00:40:37.701
EACH OF THOSE IMAGES WHAT'S

00:40:37.768 --> 00:40:39.303
REALLY FUNDAMENTALLY PART OF

00:40:39.370 --> 00:40:41.405
THAT PERSON'S IDENTITY THAT CAN

00:40:41.472 --> 00:40:43.240
BE SHARED WITH OTHER IMAGES OF

00:40:43.307 --> 00:40:44.775
THAT PERSON SO HAPPEN WE

00:40:44.842 --> 00:40:47.478
REPRESENT THAT PERSON'S FACE

00:40:47.545 --> 00:40:50.047
FROM THE DATA. INPUT TO THE

00:40:50.114 --> 00:40:51.982
COMPUTER IN THE IMAGE SO WE

00:40:52.049 --> 00:40:54.318
WANT TO IGNORE THE CONFOUNDING

00:40:54.385 --> 00:40:56.554
FACTORS THE FACIAL EXPRESSIONS

00:40:56.620 --> 00:40:57.521
THE LIGHTING THE ORIENTATIONS

00:40:57.588 --> 00:40:59.824
ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS AND

00:40:59.890 --> 00:41:01.292
FOCUS ON THE THINGS THAT ARE

00:41:01.358 --> 00:41:02.026
GOING TO BE CORPS

00:41:02.092 --> 00:41:02.760
REPRESENTATION THEY'RE GONNA

00:41:02.827 --> 00:41:04.562
REPRESENT THE ESSENCE OF

00:41:04.628 --> 00:41:06.997
PERSON. ON AND SO IF WE COULD

00:41:07.064 --> 00:41:09.266
DO THAT PERFECTLY THEN EVERY

00:41:09.333 --> 00:41:11.569
SINGLE PERSON'S FACE- THE EVERY

00:41:11.635 --> 00:41:13.437
FACE OF A SINGLE PERSON WOULD

00:41:13.504 --> 00:41:16.340
MAP TO A PARTICULAR NUMBER OR

00:41:16.407 --> 00:41:19.043
SET OF NUMBERS OR SOME KIND OF

00:41:19.109 --> 00:41:20.544
REPRESENTATION. THAT DOESN'T

00:41:20.611 --> 00:41:21.545
HAPPEN IT'S TOO DIFFICULT WHAT

00:41:21.612 --> 00:41:24.481
WE REALLY END UP BEING IS FORM

00:41:24.548 --> 00:41:28.252
SOME REPRESENTATION OF ANY OF

00:41:28.319 --> 00:41:30.554
THOSE FACES THE MUCH. VERSION

00:41:30.621 --> 00:41:33.057
IN ALL MILLION FIRST IT'S A

00:41:33.123 --> 00:41:34.258
DOZEN OF ARE FOR HUNDRED OR

00:41:34.325 --> 00:41:36.293
SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT THAT

00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:37.928
THE IDEAS THAT REPRESENTATION

00:41:37.995 --> 00:41:39.597
IS THE ESSENCE OF A PERSON-

00:41:39.663 --> 00:41:41.131
TRIES TO BE THE ESSENCE OF THAT

00:41:41.198 --> 00:41:44.568
PERSON AND THEN COMPARE THOSE

00:41:44.635 --> 00:41:47.371
REPRESENTATIONS. AND SO THAT IS

00:41:47.438 --> 00:41:50.040
CLASS FLYING BASES BY COMPARING

00:41:50.107 --> 00:41:51.342
REP IS FINE FINDING

00:41:51.408 --> 00:41:53.611
SIMILARITIES BETWEEN A

00:41:53.677 --> 00:41:54.979
REPRESENTATION YOU JUST

00:41:55.045 --> 00:41:56.780
COMPUTED FROM IN IN. AN URGENT

00:41:56.847 --> 00:41:58.816
SINCE YOU HAVE STORED OF

00:41:58.883 --> 00:42:02.586
VARIOUS THAT YOU COMPUTED

00:42:02.653 --> 00:42:04.188
BEFORE. ANYTHING RECALL VERY

00:42:04.255 --> 00:42:05.155
SMACK SOME APPLICATIONS OF A

00:42:05.222 --> 00:42:07.391
VERY HIGH. APPLICATION ARE

00:42:07.458 --> 00:42:09.126
IMPORTANT TO GET RIGHT THEN YOU

00:42:09.193 --> 00:42:10.561
WANT A VERY HIGH BAR FOR THAT

00:42:10.628 --> 00:42:12.997
SIMILARITY MATCH IF IT'S

00:42:13.063 --> 00:42:14.365
SOMETHING NOT SO IMPORTANT

00:42:14.431 --> 00:42:16.233
LIKE. RISING THE PHOTOS ON YOUR

00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:18.035
PHONE FOR EXAMPLE THEN YOU

00:42:18.102 --> 00:42:22.106
MIGHT HAVE A MUCH LOWER BAR OF

00:42:22.172 --> 00:42:22.706
WHAT IT TAKES TO BE COUNTED AS

00:42:22.773 --> 00:42:24.975
A MATCH. SO THE FIRST ONE OF

00:42:25.042 --> 00:42:26.277
AUTOMATIC FACE RECOGNITION

00:42:26.343 --> 00:42:27.811
SYSTEMS TO DO THIS KIND OF

00:42:27.878 --> 00:42:29.613
THING WAS IN THE NINETEEN

00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:31.448
SIXTIES SO LONG TIME AGO. OF

00:42:31.515 --> 00:42:33.017
THE FIRST SYSTEM THAT RELEASE

00:42:33.083 --> 00:42:34.184
FROM START TO FINISH WAS A

00:42:34.251 --> 00:42:36.186
FULLY AUTOMATED SYSTEM TO DO

00:42:36.253 --> 00:42:38.322
FACE RECOGNITION WAS A PHD

00:42:38.389 --> 00:42:40.925
THESIS IN JAPAN IN NINETEEN

00:42:40.991 --> 00:42:41.659
SEVENTY THREE SO ALSO A LONG

00:42:41.725 --> 00:42:43.060
TIME AGO. THAT'S SYSTEM

00:42:43.127 --> 00:42:44.662
REQUIRED A FRONTAL VIEW OF A

00:42:44.728 --> 00:42:46.363
FACE THAT WOULDN'T WORK ON ANY

00:42:46.430 --> 00:42:48.766
OTHER KIND OF USE- IT FOUND

00:42:48.832 --> 00:42:50.267
ABOUT TWENTY DIFFERENT FEATURES

00:42:50.334 --> 00:42:51.936
ON THE FACE IMAGE WHERE THE

00:42:52.002 --> 00:42:54.204
EYES ARE THE WITH OF THE EYES.

00:42:54.271 --> 00:42:57.675
THE WITH OF THE LIPS THE WITH

00:42:57.741 --> 00:43:00.110
OF THE OF THE MOUTH- NOSTRILS A

00:43:00.177 --> 00:43:01.712
BUNCH OF POINTS ON THE FACE.

00:43:01.779 --> 00:43:02.713
AND THEN IT TOOK SEVERAL

00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:05.649
COMBINATIONS OF THOSE POINTS

00:43:05.716 --> 00:43:09.186
DISTANCES RATIOS ANKLES THINGS

00:43:09.253 --> 00:43:10.654
LIKE THAT AND CAME UP WITH

00:43:10.721 --> 00:43:12.556
SIXTEEN MEASURES SIXTEEN

00:43:12.623 --> 00:43:14.858
NUMBERS. THAT WHAT THE

00:43:14.925 --> 00:43:17.728
REPRESENTATION OF FACE THE

00:43:17.795 --> 00:43:26.704
GOING FROM. SHOULD TO SICK. FOR

00:43:26.770 --> 00:43:27.638
A LOT OF DIFFERENT APPROACHES

00:43:27.705 --> 00:43:29.573
TO TRY TO DO THIS- AND THE

00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:31.041
COMMON THEME WAS LET'S THINK

00:43:31.108 --> 00:43:32.743
ABOUT WHAT A FACES AND THINK

00:43:32.810 --> 00:43:34.011
ABOUT HOW WE CAN MAKE A

00:43:34.078 --> 00:43:35.779
REPRESENTATION THAT WOULD DO

00:43:35.846 --> 00:43:37.915
WHAT WE NEED TO DO HERE. NOT A

00:43:37.982 --> 00:43:39.149
LOT OF SUCCESS IN IN A REAL

00:43:39.216 --> 00:43:42.386
WORLD. AND ACTUALLY SOME PRETTY

00:43:42.453 --> 00:43:43.954
WELL KNOWN FAILURES DURING THAT

00:43:44.021 --> 00:43:46.623
TIME. AROUND NINETEEN NINETY

00:43:46.690 --> 00:43:48.125
THERE ARE SOME APPROACHES THAT-

00:43:48.192 --> 00:43:50.294
STARTED TO EXPLORE A FOCUS ON

00:43:50.361 --> 00:43:52.162
LEARNING FROM THE DATA INSTEAD

00:43:52.229 --> 00:43:54.665
OF. THE HUMAN PROGRAMMERS AND

00:43:54.732 --> 00:43:56.433
RESEARCHERS SAYING LET'S TRY TO

00:43:56.500 --> 00:43:58.869
THINK HOW TO DO THIS. THE THIS

00:43:58.936 --> 00:44:00.671
NEW IDEA WAS LET'S AND DATE A

00:44:00.738 --> 00:44:02.639
BUNCH OF FACE IMAGES AND

00:44:02.706 --> 00:44:04.541
LABELED FACE IMAGES OF WHO

00:44:04.608 --> 00:44:06.377
THESE PEOPLE ARE. BRING THEM TO

00:44:06.443 --> 00:44:08.946
IT MACHINE A LET THE COMPUTER

00:44:09.013 --> 00:44:09.747
FIGURE OUT WHAT'S IMPORTANT

00:44:09.813 --> 00:44:12.316
INSTEAD OF THE P. IN A PROJECT.

00:44:12.383 --> 00:44:13.851
TO IMPORTANT. SO THIS IS WHAT'S

00:44:13.917 --> 00:44:15.853
THE MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH

00:44:15.919 --> 00:44:17.788
TO FACE RECOGNITION TRAINING

00:44:17.855 --> 00:44:19.723
SYSTEM. WITH LOTS AND LOTS OF

00:44:19.790 --> 00:44:21.458
DATA LABELED FACE IMAGES

00:44:21.525 --> 00:44:23.694
TRANTOR REPRESENT THOSE FACE

00:44:23.761 --> 00:44:25.562
IMAGES EFFICIENTLY AND WELL.

00:44:25.629 --> 00:44:26.797
THE TRAINING CAN TAKE A VERY

00:44:26.864 --> 00:44:28.532
LONG TIME WITHIN A TRAINS A

00:44:28.599 --> 00:44:30.667
SYSTEM THAT CAN BE RUN VERY

00:44:30.734 --> 00:44:33.504
VERY QUICKLY. OKAY SO ABOUT FOR

00:44:33.570 --> 00:44:35.873
ABOUT TWENTY YEARS THAT WAS-

00:44:35.939 --> 00:44:37.741
WORKED ON MORE AND MORE AND

00:44:37.808 --> 00:44:40.878
THEN IN RECENT YEARS THE LAST.

00:44:40.944 --> 00:44:41.678
TEN FIFTEEN OR SO YEARS THERE'S

00:44:41.745 --> 00:44:43.781
BEEN A REVOLUTION IN THIS AREA

00:44:43.847 --> 00:44:44.581
KNOWN AS DEEP LEARNING WHICH IS

00:44:44.648 --> 00:44:45.849
PART OF ARTIFICIAL

00:44:45.916 --> 00:44:47.885
INTELLIGENCE. WHERE MORE DATA

00:44:47.951 --> 00:44:49.787
BECAME AVAILABLE MUCH FASTER

00:44:49.853 --> 00:44:54.091
MACHINES AVAILABLE AND BETTER.

00:44:54.158 --> 00:44:55.692
IS TO CHECK IN THE SYSTEM. SO

00:44:55.759 --> 00:45:01.865
BAY. WHAT IS THE THIS WAY OF

00:45:01.932 --> 00:45:03.167
LEARNING FROM DATA. OF

00:45:03.233 --> 00:45:06.370
INSTRUCTING THE TEAM PEOPLE HAS

00:45:06.437 --> 00:45:09.406
VERY. SOON PASSED YEARS AND BY

00:45:09.473 --> 00:45:10.407
THE WAY A LOT THAT'S TAKEN

00:45:10.474 --> 00:45:13.477
PLACE IN CALIFORNIA IT

00:45:13.544 --> 00:45:17.614
UNIVERSITIES ANDBENEATH. SO

00:45:17.681 --> 00:45:20.117
THIS IS A SAMPLE. OF AND

00:45:20.184 --> 00:45:21.485
VERSION OF. DEEP NEURAL NETWORK

00:45:21.552 --> 00:45:23.187
TO DO FACE IN THEIR- SOCIAL

00:45:23.253 --> 00:45:26.323
NETWORK- FRIEND TAGGING YOUR

00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:27.758
FACE TAGGING AND BASICALLY IT'S

00:45:27.825 --> 00:45:29.626
JUST A REPRESENTATION OF WERE

00:45:29.693 --> 00:45:31.361
TOO MUCH ABOUT THE DETAILS WEAR

00:45:31.428 --> 00:45:34.164
A FACE ON THE LEFT INPUT TO THE

00:45:34.231 --> 00:45:36.366
SYSTEM- EITHER ON THE TOP

00:45:36.433 --> 00:45:38.001
WRITER TOP BOTTOM THERE JUST TO

00:45:38.068 --> 00:45:39.503
FOR TWO DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF

00:45:39.570 --> 00:45:41.438
SHOWING THE SAME THING AND IT

00:45:41.505 --> 00:45:44.541
GETS SORT OF RUN THROUGH THAT

00:45:44.608 --> 00:45:46.543
DEEP NEURAL NETWORK IN AT THE

00:45:46.610 --> 00:45:51.748
FAR RIGHT. IS A- SMALL AREA

00:45:51.815 --> 00:45:54.017
REPRESENT. ACTION THE HE IS THE

00:45:54.084 --> 00:45:55.986
A RELATIVE SMALL OF NO SO THIS

00:45:56.053 --> 00:45:58.021
DEEP NETWORK TAKES A LONG TIME

00:45:58.088 --> 00:45:59.223
TO TRAIN IT CAN TAKE DAYS TO

00:45:59.289 --> 00:46:01.258
TRAIN EVEN A WEEK SOMETIME TO

00:46:01.325 --> 00:46:03.327
TRAIN BUT THEN IT CAN BE RUN

00:46:03.393 --> 00:46:06.697
ONCE IT'S TRAIN VERY VERY

00:46:06.763 --> 00:46:08.198
QUICKLY AND IT TURNS AT THE- I.

00:46:08.265 --> 00:46:09.800
DEEP NETWORKS UP. FRONT

00:46:09.867 --> 00:46:12.402
PROGRESS GOING FROM THE SIXTEEN

00:46:12.469 --> 00:46:14.505
PARAMETERS FROM DECADES AGO TO

00:46:14.571 --> 00:46:15.973
MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF

00:46:16.039 --> 00:46:17.808
PARAMETERS THAT ARE LEARNED IN

00:46:17.875 --> 00:46:18.909
THIS TRAINING PROCESS THE

00:46:18.976 --> 00:46:20.544
CONVENTICLES RECOGNITION VERY

00:46:20.611 --> 00:46:22.846
VERY QUICKLY. SO MODERN FACE

00:46:22.913 --> 00:46:24.948
RECOGNITION SYSTEMS ARE SOME

00:46:25.015 --> 00:46:27.618
VERSION OF THIS KIND OF SYSTEM-

00:46:27.684 --> 00:46:28.919
DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS THE

00:46:28.986 --> 00:46:31.488
DETECTIVE FACE THE A LINE PROP

00:46:31.555 --> 00:46:33.023
AND RE SIZE OF FACE THE

00:46:33.090 --> 00:46:35.225
REPRESENTED AT THE END OF THAT

00:46:35.292 --> 00:46:36.326
NEURAL NETWORK AND THEY DO SOME

00:46:36.393 --> 00:46:38.162
KIND OF CLASSIFICATION. THEY

00:46:38.228 --> 00:46:39.897
MAKE ERRORS THEIR ERRORS IN

00:46:39.963 --> 00:46:41.798
EACH OF THOSE STEPS- AND

00:46:41.865 --> 00:46:43.667
THERE'S ERRORS IN THE TRAINING

00:46:43.734 --> 00:46:45.035
BUT THEIR PERFORMANCE HAS BEEN

00:46:45.102 --> 00:46:46.837
INCREDIBLE COMPARED TO THE PAST

00:46:46.904 --> 00:46:48.906
AND HAS IN SOME CASES SURPASSED

00:46:48.972 --> 00:46:51.475
HUMANS AND HUMANS ABILITIES. SO

00:46:51.542 --> 00:46:53.443
CURRENT RESEARCH AND

00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:55.646
DEVELOPMENT IN FACE RECOGNITION

00:46:55.712 --> 00:46:57.347
CONTINUES TO WORK ON DOING THIS

00:46:57.414 --> 00:46:59.716
BUT IN. UNSTRUCTURED

00:46:59.783 --> 00:47:01.718
ENVIRONMENT SO TO WORK ANYWHERE

00:47:01.785 --> 00:47:03.820
IN ANY KIND OF FACE IMAGERY- TO

00:47:03.887 --> 00:47:08.392
WORK OVER AS SOMEBODY AGES- TO-

00:47:08.458 --> 00:47:09.626
IT DO IT WITH VERY LITTLE

00:47:09.693 --> 00:47:11.395
TRAINING DATA. TO DO IT IN A

00:47:11.461 --> 00:47:12.796
WAY THAT'S REVOKE HERBAL SO IN

00:47:12.863 --> 00:47:15.032
CASE YOUR INFORMATION GETS LOST

00:47:15.098 --> 00:47:16.333
OR STOLEN OR SOMETHING LIKE

00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:17.334
THAT IT WON'T TO BE

00:47:17.401 --> 00:47:20.671
NECESSARILY- A TERRIBLE THING.

00:47:20.737 --> 00:47:22.472
AND SO THE GRAND CHALLENGE A

00:47:22.539 --> 00:47:24.241
FACE RECOGNITION IS TO BUILD

00:47:24.308 --> 00:47:26.210
FIX RECOGNITION FICK FACE

00:47:26.276 --> 00:47:27.678
RECOGNITION SYSTEMS THAT ARE

00:47:27.744 --> 00:47:30.180
ACCURATE ROBUST EASY TO USE

00:47:30.247 --> 00:47:32.082
EXTENSIBLE WORKS WELL FOR

00:47:32.149 --> 00:47:34.151
EVERYBODY. AND USABLE ONLY IN

00:47:34.218 --> 00:47:36.353
WAYS THAT ARE SAFE RESPONSIBLE

00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:38.589
ACCESSIBLE AN ETHICAL AND

00:47:38.655 --> 00:47:40.224
THAT'S WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE

00:47:40.290 --> 00:47:42.125
CONTINUE TO WORK ON TODAY. SO

00:47:42.192 --> 00:47:43.860
WE'RE VERY QUICK VERSION OF HOW

00:47:43.927 --> 00:47:45.429
I SEE FACE RECOGNITION THANK

00:47:45.495 --> 00:47:46.430
YOU VERY MUCH- FOR THAT

00:47:46.496 --> 00:47:48.031
PRESENTATION- BEFORE WE OPEN IT

00:47:48.098 --> 00:47:49.566
UP FOR QUESTIONS I'D LIKE TO

00:47:49.633 --> 00:47:51.068
ALSO WELCOME A COLLEAGUE-

00:47:51.134 --> 00:47:52.102
ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF A ROUTE

00:47:52.169 --> 00:47:53.670
THREE OF US SO WHO HAS

00:47:53.737 --> 00:47:55.138
EXTENSIVE- ENGINEERING

00:47:55.205 --> 00:47:56.506
BACKGROUND IS ALL THANK YOU.

00:47:56.573 --> 00:47:57.741
FOR JOINING US HERE TODAY SO

00:47:57.808 --> 00:48:00.177
WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO OPEN IT

00:48:00.244 --> 00:48:03.247
UP FOR QUESTIONS COMMENTS OR-

00:48:03.313 --> 00:48:04.514
OBERNOLTE OKAY. IF YOU HAVE

00:48:04.581 --> 00:48:06.683
QUESTIONS SO. I HAD A QUESTION

00:48:06.750 --> 00:48:08.518
ABOUT THIS LAST SLIDE. THAT

00:48:08.585 --> 00:48:10.120
ILLUSTRATES THE WAY THAT THE

00:48:10.187 --> 00:48:11.822
DEEP LEARNING IS- IS USED TO

00:48:11.888 --> 00:48:13.590
APPLY TO THE DATA SO- IF I

00:48:13.657 --> 00:48:15.392
UNDERSTAND IT RIGHT AND I'M NOT

00:48:15.459 --> 00:48:17.160
SURE I DO BUT- THEY'RE WITH ME

00:48:17.227 --> 00:48:18.729
SO- WE'VE GOT. VARIOUS LEVELS

00:48:18.795 --> 00:48:19.997
OF ABSTRACTION THAT WE'RE GOING

00:48:20.063 --> 00:48:21.265
THROUGH. WHEN WE'RE GOINGFROM

00:48:21.331 --> 00:48:23.800
A FACE. YOU KNOW PICTORIAL

00:48:23.867 --> 00:48:25.902
PRESENTATION WITH FACE. UP INTO

00:48:25.969 --> 00:48:27.537
OF IF YOU KNOW IT FINAL RESULT

00:48:27.604 --> 00:48:28.872
WHICH TO CALL. A START LIMITED

00:48:28.939 --> 00:48:29.873
SORT OF COORDINATES THAT YOU

00:48:29.940 --> 00:48:31.208
KNOW REPRESENTS YOU KNOW

00:48:31.275 --> 00:48:34.144
NUMERICALLY WHAT THE FACES. SO

00:48:34.211 --> 00:48:35.279
IN THE CASE OF FACIAL

00:48:35.345 --> 00:48:37.014
RECOGNITION- IS HUMAN

00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:39.383
INTERVENTION USED TO DECIDE

00:48:39.449 --> 00:48:40.217
WHAT THOSE LEVELS OF

00:48:40.284 --> 00:48:42.119
ABSTRACTION ARE I MEAN WE SAY

00:48:42.185 --> 00:48:43.353
OKAY. IN THIS LEVEL WE'RE WE'RE

00:48:43.420 --> 00:48:45.489
LOOKING FOR YOU KNOW FOR THE OP

00:48:45.555 --> 00:48:46.690
ARE IN THE IN THE STATE. OF THE

00:48:46.757 --> 00:48:47.391
EYES IN THIS LEVEL WE'RE

00:48:47.457 --> 00:48:48.825
TALKING. YOU KNOW SHAPE OF

00:48:48.892 --> 00:48:52.663
YEARS OR WHATEVER IT IS. OR IS.

00:48:52.729 --> 00:48:53.330
HE THE MACHINE OR- AND- THAT IS

00:48:53.397 --> 00:48:54.931
WELL. YEAH SO. THE LATTER THE

00:48:54.998 --> 00:48:55.932
MACHINELEARNING IS CONTROL OF

00:48:55.999 --> 00:48:57.634
THAT THE FORMER SORT OF HOW

00:48:57.701 --> 00:48:58.902
HEALTH PEOPLE USED TO DO

00:48:58.969 --> 00:49:01.338
THINGS. AND NOW WE LET THE DATA

00:49:01.405 --> 00:49:04.308
DETERMINE. BUT YOU. HAVING SAID

00:49:04.374 --> 00:49:06.310
THAT THERE'S STILL THE QUESTION

00:49:06.376 --> 00:49:07.377
OF HOW YOU'RE GOING TO BUILD

00:49:07.444 --> 00:49:09.446
THIS SYSTEM IN PERSON. SEN WAS

00:49:09.513 --> 00:49:10.047
SORT OF SORT OF THE OVAL ARE

00:49:10.113 --> 00:49:13.116
ALL OVERALL ARE. SURE IN WHICH

00:49:13.183 --> 00:49:14.618
THE LEARNING TAKES PLACE IN

00:49:14.685 --> 00:49:21.258
WHICH DATA. TRACK ASSIST. AND

00:49:21.325 --> 00:49:26.830
SO THEY SORT OF. SOME ICE. AB

00:49:26.897 --> 00:49:27.597
TWO ONE. THE MACHINE IS MAKING

00:49:27.664 --> 00:49:29.032
THE DECISIONS IN NOT IT'S NOT A

00:49:29.099 --> 00:49:30.867
PERSONAL. IT POINT SAYING

00:49:30.934 --> 00:49:32.569
LEARNED THIS VAN AND- THEN

00:49:32.636 --> 00:49:34.805
OKAY. SO THEN ASKING THE

00:49:34.871 --> 00:49:36.406
QUESTION IN REVERSE I KNOW ONE

00:49:36.473 --> 00:49:38.642
OF THE CRITICISMS OF MACHINE

00:49:38.709 --> 00:49:40.544
LEARNING ALGORITHMS HAS BEEN

00:49:40.610 --> 00:49:42.412
THAT THERE'S NO WAY TO ASK THEM

00:49:42.479 --> 00:49:44.514
IT THE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

00:49:44.581 --> 00:49:46.616
TO JUSTIFY HOW IT MADE A

00:49:46.683 --> 00:49:47.784
CERTAIN DECISION SO IN OTHER

00:49:47.851 --> 00:49:49.619
WORDS YOU SHORT YOU ASKED THE

00:49:49.686 --> 00:49:50.554
QUESTION RIVERS AND SORT OF

00:49:50.620 --> 00:49:56.259
SHOWING A FACE. AND. WHY DO YOU

00:49:56.326 --> 00:49:58.595
THINK THAT THAT IS YOU KNOW

00:49:58.662 --> 00:49:59.830
WHAT THE FACES AND I THINK THAT

00:49:59.896 --> 00:50:02.566
THIS PARTICULAR RELEVANCE TO

00:50:02.632 --> 00:50:03.734
USING THIS TECHNOLOGY IN A LAWN

00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:05.569
PERSPECTIVE BECAUSE ULTIMATELY

00:50:05.635 --> 00:50:07.671
YOU KNOW WHAT- IF WE HAVE TO GO

00:50:07.738 --> 00:50:09.506
TO COURT AND WE USE IT IN AN

00:50:09.573 --> 00:50:11.074
EVIDENTIARY WAY YOU HAVE TO

00:50:11.141 --> 00:50:12.242
HAVE JUSTIFICATION FOR. YOU

00:50:12.309 --> 00:50:13.977
KNOW WHY WE THINK THIS IS THE

00:50:14.044 --> 00:50:16.613
WAY IT IS SO IS THERE A WAY AS

00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:17.247
THEY DON'T OF THE DEEP LEARNING

00:50:17.314 --> 00:50:18.815
ALGORITHMS THAT ARE BEING USED

00:50:18.882 --> 00:50:20.617
FOR THE SYSTEM IS THERE A WAY

00:50:20.684 --> 00:50:21.084
TO CREATE THAT RIVERS

00:50:21.151 --> 00:50:23.120
JUSTIFICATION. THERE A LOT OF

00:50:23.186 --> 00:50:24.121
PEOPLE WORKING ON THAT RIGHT

00:50:24.187 --> 00:50:25.922
NOW IT'S A WELL KNOWN CONCERN

00:50:25.989 --> 00:50:27.491
AND PROBLEM AND IN FACT THE

00:50:27.557 --> 00:50:28.825
GOVERNMENT IS FUNDING PROGRAMS-

00:50:28.892 --> 00:50:30.694
CALLED EXPLAINABLE ARTIFICE

00:50:30.761 --> 00:50:31.762
ARTIST SO INTELLIGENCE IN

00:50:31.828 --> 00:50:33.497
GENERAL TO DO THAT SORT OF

00:50:33.563 --> 00:50:35.499
THING- BUT I WOULDN'T SAY THAT

00:50:35.565 --> 00:50:37.434
THERE ARE. VERY GOOD TOOLS

00:50:37.501 --> 00:50:39.002
RIGHT NOW THAT ACCOMPLISH THAT

00:50:39.069 --> 00:50:40.537
IT'S A PEOPLE ARE ON THEIR WAY

00:50:40.604 --> 00:50:42.706
WORKING TOWARD THAT END. RIGHT

00:50:42.773 --> 00:50:44.641
THANK YOU. I HAVE A COUPLE

00:50:44.708 --> 00:50:46.276
QUESTIONS ON THE SAME LINE.

00:50:46.343 --> 00:50:47.978
OBVIOUSLY THE HOW THE DECISION

00:50:48.044 --> 00:50:51.114
IS BEING MADE IS DETERMINED BY

00:50:51.181 --> 00:50:52.249
THE- TYPE OF OTHER THAN BEING

00:50:52.315 --> 00:50:54.384
USED. AND I PRESUME THERE THERE

00:50:54.451 --> 00:50:56.353
IS- GOOD AUGER RHYTHMS OUT

00:50:56.420 --> 00:50:57.621
THERE AND THERE ARE. A BETTER

00:50:57.687 --> 00:50:59.389
ARE YOUR THE OTHER ISMS OUT

00:50:59.456 --> 00:51:01.758
THERE OR OR NOT AS GOOD SO. SO

00:51:01.825 --> 00:51:03.160
HOW DO HOW DO HOW DOES ONE

00:51:03.226 --> 00:51:05.529
DETERMINE. OF YOU KNOW WHAT

00:51:05.595 --> 00:51:06.897
WHAT TO USE I KNOW IT'S PART OF

00:51:06.963 --> 00:51:08.698
IT IS THE DENNIS STANDARD AND

00:51:08.765 --> 00:51:11.001
ALL THAT BUT- BUT HOW. HOW CAN

00:51:11.067 --> 00:51:12.402
LET'S A LAY PERSON YOU KNOW

00:51:12.469 --> 00:51:14.204
DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT. A

00:51:14.271 --> 00:51:16.239
CERTAIN A PARTICULAR ORDER THEM

00:51:16.306 --> 00:51:18.008
OUGHT TO BE USE OR HOW HOW IT

00:51:18.074 --> 00:51:19.509
A- LOGARITHM. OUGHT TO BE

00:51:19.576 --> 00:51:21.344
JUDGED. FO EXAMPLE. WILL

00:51:21.411 --> 00:51:22.646
GENERALLY LAY PERSON IS NOT

00:51:22.712 --> 00:51:23.647
GOING TO BE MAKING THAT

00:51:23.713 --> 00:51:24.781
DECISION RIGHT LAY PERSON'S

00:51:26.016 --> 00:51:27.951
THEIR SYSTEMS GOING TO LET YOU

00:51:28.018 --> 00:51:28.618
IN IT OR NOT RIGHT OR LAY

00:51:28.685 --> 00:51:29.352
PERSON'S GOING TO GO TO THE

00:51:29.419 --> 00:51:31.121
AIRPORT AND SOMEONE SYSTEM IS

00:51:31.188 --> 00:51:32.722
GOING TO. LET THAT PERSON

TALK TO THE PEOPLE WHO MADE THE

00:51:39.830 --> 00:51:41.198
SYSTEMS AND MAKE THOSE CHOICES.

00:51:41.264 --> 00:51:42.766
OR OR AT ARE YOU ASKING

00:51:42.833 --> 00:51:44.034
SOMETHING DIFFERENT YEAH I

00:51:44.100 --> 00:51:44.868
THINK ESSENTIALLY THAT THAT'S

00:51:44.935 --> 00:51:47.304
IT. NOW ALL IN LIGHT OF ALL THE

00:51:47.370 --> 00:51:48.705
CHALLENGES THAT YOU MENTION-

00:51:48.772 --> 00:51:51.007
SUED THE QUESTION THAT I HAVE

00:51:51.074 --> 00:51:52.642
IS- YOU KNOW IF ART. THE

00:51:52.709 --> 00:51:57.747
TECHNOLOGY OUR- THE GOOD. TIME

00:51:57.814 --> 00:52:04.354
THE BASE. SAID UP. HOW TO

00:52:04.421 --> 00:52:07.090
DEPLOY A- G. R. IN A CELL. R.

00:52:07.157 --> 00:52:09.960
IT SO THEN. YOU KNOW. THEN

00:52:10.026 --> 00:52:10.794
MAYBE JUST THE PART OF. FIRST

00:52:10.861 --> 00:52:11.962
YES WITH VERY. KEEPING MIND

00:52:12.028 --> 00:52:13.763
THAT FOR. RECOGNITION IS A LOT

00:52:13.830 --> 00:52:14.898
OF THINGS ARE HAS A LOT OF

00:52:14.965 --> 00:52:16.333
DIFFERENT KINDS OF APPLICATIONS

00:52:16.399 --> 00:52:19.135
SO FOR EXAMPLE. IT TO USE IT

00:52:19.202 --> 00:52:21.304
TO- AUTOMATICALLY. CLUSTER

00:52:21.371 --> 00:52:23.039
IMAGES ON YOUR LARGE IMAGE

00:52:23.106 --> 00:52:24.307
COLLECTION ON YOUR PHONE OR

00:52:24.374 --> 00:52:26.943
COMPUTER OR SOMETHING- THAT

00:52:27.010 --> 00:52:28.478
DOESN'T HAVE TO BE PERFECT IT'S

00:52:28.545 --> 00:52:30.113
NOT GONNA HURT TOO MANY PEOPLE

00:52:30.180 --> 00:52:31.314
HIGH THINK AT ALL. IF THEIR

00:52:31.381 --> 00:52:33.149
MISTAKES IN THEIR- IN FACE

00:52:33.216 --> 00:52:35.085
RECOGNITION CAN DO A GREAT JOB

00:52:35.151 --> 00:52:36.086
OF THAT RIGHT NOW. OR FOR

00:52:36.152 --> 00:52:37.988
EXAMPLE SUGGESTING A FRIEND TO

00:52:38.054 --> 00:52:39.256
BE YOU KNOW LABELED IN YOUR

00:52:39.322 --> 00:52:41.525
PERSONAL COLLECTION OF IMAGES.

00:52:41.591 --> 00:52:42.626
THERE'S NOT TOO MANY RISKS

00:52:42.692 --> 00:52:43.894
ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE KINDS OF

00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:45.695
BEHAVIORS. AND SO FACE RECKON

00:52:45.762 --> 00:52:46.963
IT FACE RECOGNITION HAS BEEN

00:52:47.030 --> 00:52:49.232
USED FOR A LOT FOR A WHILE NOW

00:52:49.299 --> 00:52:50.700
FOR THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. IS

00:52:50.767 --> 00:52:52.702
IT READY TO BE FULLY AUTOMATIC

00:52:52.769 --> 00:52:53.637
TO PULL THE TRIGGER ON THE

00:52:53.703 --> 00:52:56.606
DECISION. IT'S GOING TO HAVE A

00:52:56.673 --> 00:52:57.474
SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON

00:52:57.541 --> 00:53:00.310
SOMEBODY'S LIFE. IT DEPENDS THE

00:53:00.377 --> 00:53:02.612
SCENARIO. IMAGE CENTER IT

00:53:02.679 --> 00:53:05.715
DEPENDS THAT AFFECTS IS THERE.

00:53:05.782 --> 00:53:11.054
KIND OF. IF IN THAT CASE. US I.

00:53:11.121 --> 00:53:15.458
THINK IT'S A- YES WHEN. THE

00:53:15.525 --> 00:53:20.530
SORT OF A- LIKE A TO A- I.

00:53:20.597 --> 00:53:23.166
ARMED HEY SIR IS NOW YOUR

00:53:23.233 --> 00:53:26.436
MENTION ABOUT THE 30% TO THE-

00:53:26.503 --> 00:53:28.071
TO THE EQUATION I WANTED TO TRY

00:53:28.138 --> 00:53:30.640
THAT THE OF THE OF THE TWO. NOW

00:53:30.707 --> 00:53:33.677
FOR SOMEFACES PART PART OF THE

00:53:33.743 --> 00:53:35.145
FACE IS BEING CONCEALED OR

00:53:35.211 --> 00:53:36.379
LET'S SEE IF SOMEBODY'S MOVING

00:53:36.446 --> 00:53:38.214
THEN ALL THOSE THINGS WILL COME

00:53:38.281 --> 00:53:42.319
INTO PLAY I PRESUME. YEAH THE-

00:53:42.385 --> 00:53:45.789
QUESTION THAT I HAVE WAS. ARE

00:53:45.855 --> 00:53:51.628
YOU LET'S SAY. OUGHT WHAT ABOUT

00:53:51.695 --> 00:53:53.630
DIFFERENT CAMERAS LET YOU KNOW.

00:53:53.697 --> 00:53:55.932
ARE THERE SITUATIONS WHERE YOU

00:53:55.999 --> 00:53:56.466
NEED TO HAVE MORE THAN ONE

00:53:56.533 --> 00:54:00.537
CAMERA FOR EXAMPLE. POTENTIALLY

00:54:00.604 --> 00:54:02.272
I I'D SAY A MORE SIGNIFICANT

00:54:02.339 --> 00:54:04.207
CORE ISSUE OR QUESTION IS JUST

00:54:04.274 --> 00:54:06.142
THE IMAGINING ENVIRONMENT OR IS

00:54:06.209 --> 00:54:07.911
IT SORT OF A PASSPORT PHOTO

00:54:07.978 --> 00:54:09.179
SCENARIO WHERE SOMEONE'S

00:54:09.245 --> 00:54:10.780
WALKING IN IT IN FRONT OF A

00:54:10.847 --> 00:54:12.282
CAMERA AND LOOKING AT THE

00:54:12.349 --> 00:54:13.516
CAMERA AND WAITING FOR THE

00:54:13.583 --> 00:54:15.251
PICTURE TO BE TAKEN. OR ARE YOU

00:54:15.318 --> 00:54:16.620
LOOKING AT PEOPLE WALKING

00:54:16.686 --> 00:54:18.254
DOWNTOWN AND TRYING TO FIGURE

00:54:18.321 --> 00:54:19.589
OUT IF THAT SOMEONE YOU CARE

00:54:19.656 --> 00:54:20.523
ABOUT YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S A

00:54:20.590 --> 00:54:22.392
MUCH BIGGER DIFFERENTIAL

00:54:22.459 --> 00:54:23.593
BETWEEN THOSE TWO SCENARIOS.

00:54:23.660 --> 00:54:25.595
THAN MAYBE ONE CAMERA CAMERON

00:54:25.662 --> 00:54:30.033
IN MOST SITUATIONS. GOT IT ARE

00:54:30.100 --> 00:54:33.770
EIGHT. OKAY THIS CREDIT CARD I

00:54:33.837 --> 00:54:34.270
JUST TO FOLLOW UP ON THE

00:54:34.337 --> 00:54:36.573
QUESTION BEFORE THAT SO ARE YOU

00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:38.375
ARE WE ABLE TO- GENERATE

00:54:38.441 --> 00:54:41.277
CONFIDENCE INTERVALS OR- BY YOU

00:54:41.344 --> 00:54:42.412
KNOW ADJUSTING THE NUMBER OF

00:54:42.479 --> 00:54:44.748
PARAMETERS UP ORDER DOWNWARD-

00:54:44.814 --> 00:54:47.584
CALIBRATE THE- YOU KNOW THE

00:54:47.651 --> 00:54:48.985
CERTAINTY ARE THE ODDS OF A

00:54:49.052 --> 00:54:50.487
FALSE POSITIVE OR A FALSE

00:54:50.553 --> 00:54:51.388
NEGATIVE AND THEN ADJUST THAT

00:54:51.454 --> 00:54:52.989
ACCORDINGLY DEPENDING ON THE

00:54:53.056 --> 00:54:57.160
SITUATION- YES AND NO SO YES

00:54:57.227 --> 00:54:58.828
UNCERTAINTIES ARE CALCULATED

00:54:58.895 --> 00:54:59.963
WITH MOST COMPOSED OF THE

00:55:00.030 --> 00:55:02.065
SYSTEMS THAT ARE USEFUL BUT

00:55:02.132 --> 00:55:04.267
THEY'RE NOT ACTUAL- OFFICE.

00:55:04.334 --> 00:55:05.969
THEY'RE NOT YOU KNOW-

00:55:06.036 --> 00:55:08.204
PROBABILITIES AND SO THEY'RE

00:55:08.271 --> 00:55:09.506
USEFUL NUMBERS THEY CAN HELP

00:55:09.572 --> 00:55:11.541
YOU UNDERSTAND THE USER OF THE

00:55:11.608 --> 00:55:14.477
SYSTEM OR OR THE PERSON LOOKING

00:55:14.544 --> 00:55:15.779
AT THE DECISIONS MADE BY THE

00:55:15.845 --> 00:55:17.981
SYSTEM HOW COMMON IT WAS THAT

00:55:18.048 --> 00:55:19.516
DECISION I NEED I WILL CHOOSE A

00:55:19.582 --> 00:55:21.985
OR LIKE A BAT OF THERE'S NO

00:55:22.052 --> 00:55:26.523
pTHOSE UNCERTAINTIES. I'M

00:55:26.589 --> 00:55:27.624
THINKING OF KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE

00:55:27.691 --> 00:55:28.258
A DNA ACT OR SOMETHING THIS AS

00:55:28.324 --> 00:55:29.192
THEIR AND WANTED BILLION JAN

00:55:29.259 --> 00:55:30.760
THAT THIS IS WRONG I COULD

00:55:30.827 --> 00:55:34.364
SIMILAR. STATEMENTS BE MADE.

00:55:34.431 --> 00:55:36.533
YES I DON'T KNOW HOW. PRECISE

00:55:36.599 --> 00:55:37.867
SUCH STATEMENTS CAN BE MADE

00:55:37.934 --> 00:55:39.936
TODAY BUT I BELIEVE IT'S MOVING

00:55:40.003 --> 00:55:40.837
THAT DIRECTION BE ABLE TO MAKE

00:55:40.904 --> 00:55:42.238
QUITE PRECISE STATEMENTS ABOUT

00:55:42.305 --> 00:55:44.340
THAT BUT EVEN EVEN IF THE DNA

00:55:44.407 --> 00:55:45.341
THERE'S A THERE'S A CERTAIN

00:55:45.408 --> 00:55:47.577
AMOUNT OF UNCERTAINTY WITH

00:55:47.644 --> 00:55:48.211
THOSE RIGHT SO WITH ALL OF FROM

00:55:48.278 --> 00:55:50.880
THERE WOULD BE. I THINK IF I

00:55:50.947 --> 00:55:53.283
COULD GO BACK OUT I THINK THAT

00:55:53.349 --> 00:55:53.850
WAS THE QUESTION KIND OF THE

00:55:53.917 --> 00:55:54.951
QUESTION THAT I WAS GOING TO.

00:55:55.018 --> 00:55:56.352
ASK AND THAT IS THE ERROR. I

00:55:56.419 --> 00:55:59.022
MEAN IS THERE A THRESHOLD IS A-

00:55:59.089 --> 00:56:02.959
HE ARE- INDICATED THAT. PEOPLE

00:56:03.026 --> 00:56:05.095
CAN USE TO SAIL. THIS PROGRAM

00:56:05.161 --> 00:56:07.063
IS LET'S SAY 5% ERROR RATE IN.

00:56:07.130 --> 00:56:07.864
YOU KNOW IS THERE SOMETHING

00:56:07.931 --> 00:56:09.399
THAT THAT WE CAN USE. OUR

00:56:09.466 --> 00:56:11.034
FAMILY NAME IS FOR THOSE

00:56:11.101 --> 00:56:15.238
PERSPECTIVE. AGAIN I SEE THAT

00:56:15.305 --> 00:56:16.773
MORE AS SOMEONE WHO'S

00:56:16.840 --> 00:56:18.174
IMPLEMENTING A SYSTEM FOR THEIR

00:56:18.241 --> 00:56:20.176
COMPANY YOUR GOVERNOR WHATEVER

00:56:20.243 --> 00:56:20.877
TO LOOK AT THOSE KINDS OF

00:56:20.944 --> 00:56:22.112
NUMBERS FOR THE VENDORS YOU

00:56:22.178 --> 00:56:23.580
MIGHT CONSIDER. YOU KNOW

00:56:23.646 --> 00:56:25.315
PURCHASING A SYSTEM FROM I

00:56:25.381 --> 00:56:27.717
DON'T SEE HOW- LAYPERSON

00:56:27.784 --> 00:56:30.019
CONSUMER WILL NECESSARILY MAKE

00:56:30.086 --> 00:56:31.988
USE OF THOSE KINDS OF NUMBERS I

00:56:32.055 --> 00:56:33.456
WAS ONE OF THE TWENTY PLUS

00:56:33.523 --> 00:56:35.825
LEGISLATORS ARE MISIDENTIFIED

00:56:35.892 --> 00:56:37.727
BY PROGRAM BY WAY OF FORTY

00:56:37.794 --> 00:56:40.096
PROGRAM. AND SUBSEQUENT TO THAT

00:56:40.163 --> 00:56:41.264
I THINK I SOMEBODY MENTIONED TO

00:56:41.331 --> 00:56:44.000
ME THAT. IF DE UM. IF THE

00:56:44.067 --> 00:56:47.137
THRESHOLD WAS ADJUSTED PROPERLY

00:56:47.203 --> 00:56:48.438
ON MEANING THAT LET'S SEE IF

00:56:48.505 --> 00:56:49.806
THE ERROR RATE WAS SALAS AND

00:56:49.873 --> 00:56:51.808
FIVE PERCENT. THEN THE YOU KNOW

00:56:51.875 --> 00:56:53.276
I WOULD BEEN OF PROPERLY

00:56:53.343 --> 00:56:55.545
IDENTIFIED BY THE PROGRAM- IS

00:56:55.612 --> 00:56:56.846
THAT SOMETHING THAT'S KIND OF

00:56:56.913 --> 00:56:59.949
COMMON IN IN THE INDUSTRY- YES-

00:57:00.016 --> 00:57:01.751
AND AN MEANS TWO THINGS TO SAY

00:57:01.818 --> 00:57:04.387
THAT THAT ERROR RATE. GOES DOWN

00:57:04.454 --> 00:57:05.555
EVERY YEAR SO IN A WITH A AS OF

00:57:05.622 --> 00:57:07.557
TECHNOLOGIES LIKE THIS IT GETS

00:57:07.624 --> 00:57:10.226
BETTER ALL THE TIME- AND- YES

00:57:10.293 --> 00:57:12.128
YOU IF. ARE PROPERLY LOOKING AT

00:57:12.195 --> 00:57:13.930
NOT ONLY THE ANSWER BUT ALSO

00:57:13.997 --> 00:57:15.832
THE UNCERTAINTY MEASURE OR YOU

00:57:15.899 --> 00:57:16.299
KNOW OTHER INFORMATION

00:57:16.366 --> 00:57:18.168
ASSOCIATED WITH THAT- THERE

00:57:18.234 --> 00:57:19.469

AVAILABLE TO MAKE GOOD

00:57:20.470 --> 00:57:22.272
DECISIONS. THAN SOME OF THESE

00:57:22.338 --> 00:57:24.207
PUBLIC TEST MIGHT ACTUALLY LEAD

00:57:24.274 --> 00:57:26.009
YOU TO BELIEVE. GOT IT OKAY

MANY DEVELOPERS OFFICIAL

00:58:24.500 --> 00:58:26.035
RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY AND

00:58:26.102 --> 00:58:28.404
CALIFORNIA'S ACTUALLY HOME TO

00:58:28.471 --> 00:58:30.073
SEVERAL LEADERS IN THIS FIELD I

00:58:30.139 --> 00:58:31.574
ACTUALLY WANTED TO- BEFORE

00:58:31.641 --> 00:58:32.842
PROCEEDING OF THE QUESTION

00:58:32.909 --> 00:58:33.843
WE'RE JUST TALKING ABOUT THE

00:58:33.910 --> 00:58:36.646
LAST SEGMENT- SO THE MAYBE HELP

00:58:36.713 --> 00:58:39.515
LIKE I COULD EXPLAIN SO- EVEN A

00:58:39.582 --> 00:58:40.350
SIMPLER WAITED TO UNDERSTAND

00:58:40.416 --> 00:58:41.918
FISH RECOGNITION IS BASICALLY.

00:58:41.985 --> 00:58:43.887
COME UP PHOTO COMPARISON TOOL

00:58:43.953 --> 00:58:45.955
SO YOU'VE GOT ONE PHOTO YOU'RE

00:58:46.022 --> 00:58:47.957
COMPARING IT WITH ONE OR MANY

00:58:48.024 --> 00:58:49.192
MORE OTHER PHOTOS. THE JOB DID

00:58:49.259 --> 00:58:51.027
THE PART THAT IS THAT THE

00:58:51.094 --> 00:58:52.462
MACHINE DOES IS CREATE A

00:58:52.528 --> 00:58:54.931
SIMILARITY SCORE RATES THAT FOR

00:58:54.998 --> 00:58:56.699
OTHER PHOTO OR OTHER PHOTOS ON

00:58:56.766 --> 00:58:58.201
HOUSE SOMEWHERE THEY ARE TOO.

00:58:58.268 --> 00:58:59.202
THE PHOTO YOU'RE COMPARING

00:58:59.269 --> 00:59:01.571
AGAINST IN SO- BUT AS YOU

00:59:01.638 --> 00:59:03.172
MENTIONED- GERMAN AT THE-

00:59:03.239 --> 00:59:05.508
THRESHOLD IS SAT. OVER WHICH

00:59:05.575 --> 00:59:07.944
THE SYSTEM MAKES A- POTENTIAL

00:59:08.011 --> 00:59:09.445
MATCH DETERMINATION OR

00:59:09.512 --> 00:59:10.346
MASTURBATION UNDER WHICH IT

00:59:10.413 --> 00:59:12.048
DOESN'T. SET THRESHOLD IS

00:59:12.115 --> 00:59:14.884
ABSOLUTELY- ADJUSTED BY HUMAN

00:59:14.951 --> 00:59:16.619
SO EITHER THE OPERATOR WHERE

00:59:16.686 --> 00:59:17.987
THE DEVELOPER WAS SAID IT AND

00:59:18.054 --> 00:59:18.955
THAT IS GOING TO DEPEND ON THE

00:59:19.022 --> 00:59:21.524
PURPOSE. SO JUST TO TWO

00:59:21.591 --> 00:59:23.026
EXAMPLES ONE IF THE PURPOSE OF

00:59:23.092 --> 00:59:24.227
THE SYSTEM IS TO HELP SPEED

00:59:24.294 --> 00:59:26.162
ENTRIES LIKE SAY TO UP TO A

00:59:26.229 --> 00:59:27.964
VENUE- YOU WANT TO SET IT SO

00:59:28.031 --> 00:59:29.198
YOU'RE NOT GONNA HAVE A LOT OF

00:59:29.265 --> 00:59:31.834
FALSE- FALSE. THIS IS MISS

00:59:31.901 --> 00:59:33.069
RATES SO YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE

00:59:33.136 --> 00:59:35.204
LINE'S ANY LONG SOMEONE SOMEONE

00:59:35.271 --> 00:59:36.439
MAYBE IT'S POSITIVE SOMEONE IS

00:59:36.506 --> 00:59:37.473
A TICKET THAT'S KIND OF

00:59:37.540 --> 00:59:40.743
UNLIKELY TO HAPPEN THAT'S NOT

00:59:40.810 --> 00:59:41.311
AS MUCH OF A CONCERN. ON THE

00:59:41.377 --> 00:59:41.911
FLIP SIDE. SHOW LIKE FOR LAW

FACE RECOGNITION WHICH IS GOING

01:00:03.066 --> 01:00:04.133
ON FOR TWENTY YEARS. IT'S

01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:05.268
DEFINITELY A WORLD STANDARD ON

01:00:05.335 --> 01:00:07.003
EVALUATING ACCURACY OF THE OF

01:00:07.070 --> 01:00:09.005
THE ALGORITHMS. ARE BASICALLY

01:00:09.072 --> 01:00:10.573
IN LOOKING AT THIS WORK THE

01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:11.407
BOTTOM LINE FROM OUR

01:00:11.474 --> 01:00:12.875
PERSPECTIVE IS THAT MODERN

01:00:12.942 --> 01:00:13.543
MODERN FACIAL RECOGNITION

01:00:13.609 --> 01:00:15.678
TECHNOLOGY IS HIGHLY ACCURATE-

01:00:15.745 --> 01:00:16.879
N'EST IS FOUND AT THE FACIAL

01:00:16.946 --> 01:00:18.848
RECOGNITION SOFTWARE TEST IS

01:00:18.915 --> 01:00:19.615
NOW MORE THAN TWENTY TIMES IS

01:00:19.682 --> 01:00:21.084
ACCURATE. AND JUST A FEW YEARS

01:00:21.150 --> 01:00:22.452
AGO AND RETRIEVING A MATCHING

01:00:22.518 --> 01:00:23.853

PERFECT PERFORMANCE BY HIGH

01:00:26.322 --> 01:00:27.590
QUALITY ALGORITHMS WITNESS

01:00:27.657 --> 01:00:28.691
RATES AVERAGING JUST POINT ONE

01:00:28.758 --> 01:00:30.360
PERCENT. THIS REACHES THE

01:00:30.426 --> 01:00:31.194
ACCURACY OF AUTOMATED

01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:35.198

IDENTIFICATION. ON THE ISSUE OF

01:00:36.666 --> 01:00:37.533
DEMOGRAPHIC EFFECTS ARE YOU

01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:38.101
KNOW WE'RE GONNA BE TALKING

01:00:38.167 --> 01:00:39.936
MORE ABOUT- THIS HEARING. THE

01:00:40.003 --> 01:00:41.804
CONTEXT IS CRITICAL BECAUSE-

01:00:41.871 --> 01:00:43.306
IMAGE QUALITY ISSUES MANY OF

01:00:43.373 --> 01:00:45.041
WHICH WERE WORKED ARE SHOWN IN

01:00:45.108 --> 01:00:46.209
THE LAST PRESENTATION. HAVE

01:00:46.275 --> 01:00:46.909
ACTUALLY BEEN THE MOST

01:00:46.976 --> 01:00:47.677
SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGED AFTER

01:00:47.744 --> 01:00:49.846
SEEING NOT- DEMOGRAPHIC

01:00:49.912 --> 01:00:51.647
EFFECTS. A HOWEVER- THE OUR

01:00:51.714 --> 01:00:52.782
VIEW IS THAT THE REASON THIS

01:00:52.849 --> 01:00:54.050
DEMOGRAPHIC REPORT THAT CAME

01:00:54.117 --> 01:00:55.585
OUT IN DECEMBER. PROVIDES A

01:00:55.651 --> 01:00:56.786
CONFERENCE OF ANSWER TO MANY OF

01:00:56.853 --> 01:00:57.854
OUR MOST PRESSING QUESTIONS

01:00:57.920 --> 01:00:58.521
ABOUT FACIAL RECOGNITION

01:00:58.588 --> 01:01:01.224
ACCURACY. I AND RELATED

01:01:01.290 --> 01:01:02.592
CONCERNS ABOUT BIAS. IT FOUND

01:01:02.658 --> 01:01:03.259
THE HIGHEST PERFORMING

01:01:03.326 --> 01:01:04.794
ALGORITHMS HAD UNDETECTABLE

01:01:04.861 --> 01:01:06.062
DIFFERENCES IN PERFORMANCE

01:01:06.129 --> 01:01:07.430
ACROSS DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS.

01:01:07.497 --> 01:01:08.931
WHILE MOST OTHERS PERFORMED

01:01:08.998 --> 01:01:09.932
MORE CONSISTENTLY THAN AND

01:01:09.999 --> 01:01:11.434
WIDELY REPORTED IN THE MEDIA

01:01:11.501 --> 01:01:12.935
AND ALSO IN SEVERAL NON

01:01:13.002 --> 01:01:15.138
SCIENTIFIC TESTS. WELL SOME

01:01:15.204 --> 01:01:16.272
COMMENTARY SPOKES ON THE VERY

01:01:16.339 --> 01:01:17.440
LOWEST PERFORMING ALGORITHMS

01:01:17.507 --> 01:01:18.775
IT'S IMPORTANT POINT OUT THAT

01:01:18.841 --> 01:01:19.976
KEY GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS ARE

01:01:20.043 --> 01:01:21.344
ALREADY USING SO THE HIGHEST

01:01:21.411 --> 01:01:23.112
PERFORMING TECHNOLOGY DEFIED.

01:01:23.179 --> 01:01:24.647
WITH ACCURACY RATES WELL ABOVE

01:01:24.714 --> 01:01:26.282
99% AN UNDETECTABLE FALSE

01:01:26.349 --> 01:01:27.517
POSITIVE PERFORMANCE ACROSS

DEMOGRAPHICS EVEN WHEN TESTED

01:01:29.452 --> 01:01:30.920
AGAINST GALLERIES OF UP TO

01:01:30.987 --> 01:01:33.189
TWELVE MILLION. IMAGES SO TO

01:01:33.256 --> 01:01:34.991
FULLY COMPREHEND THE BENEFITS

01:01:35.058 --> 01:01:36.392
THIS TECHNOLOGY YOU HAVE TO

01:01:36.459 --> 01:01:37.927
CONSIDER WHETHER THE USE OF IT.

01:01:37.994 --> 01:01:39.362
WHICH IS TYPICALLY TO ASSIST

01:01:39.429 --> 01:01:40.997
NOT REPLACE HUMAN ANALYSIS AND

01:01:41.064 --> 01:01:43.099
DECISION MAKING. IS BETTER THAN

01:01:43.166 --> 01:01:43.599
THE ALTERNATIVE OF HUMAN

01:01:43.666 --> 01:01:45.301
RECOGNITION ONLY. HEAR THE

01:01:45.368 --> 01:01:46.636
EVIDENCE IS INDISPUTABLE AS

01:01:46.702 --> 01:01:48.071

YEARS AGO AND ELSEWHERE.

01:01:49.739 --> 01:01:50.840
AUTOMATED FACIAL RECOGNITION

01:01:50.907 --> 01:01:52.508
ALONG WITH EVEN ANALYSIS IS

01:01:52.575 --> 01:01:54.444
MORE ACCURATE AND LESS BIASED

01:01:54.510 --> 01:01:55.845
THAN HUMAN RECOGNITION ALONE.

01:01:55.912 --> 01:01:56.746
YOU'VE LIKELY HEARD SOME

01:01:56.813 --> 01:01:57.680
PERSPECTIVES THE CALL FOR

01:01:57.747 --> 01:01:59.015
SEVERELY RESTRICTING OR EVEN

01:01:59.082 --> 01:02:00.450
BANNING THE TECHNOLOGY. THE KEY

01:02:00.516 --> 01:02:01.717
QUESTION HERE IS WHETHER IT'S

01:02:01.784 --> 01:02:03.252
APPROPRIATE TO LIMIT PROCESSES

01:02:03.319 --> 01:02:04.821
TO HUMAN CAPABILITY ALONE WHEN

PHOTOS AT THE PRESENT TIME

01:14:17.152 --> 01:14:18.453
BECAUSE THE IDENTITIES OF THE

01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:19.988
IN THE INDIVIDUALS ARE KNOWN

01:14:20.055 --> 01:14:21.623
WITH BIOMETRICS THAT ARE

SOCIAL MEDIA ARE NOT POSSIBLE

01:14:48.851 --> 01:14:50.786
BUT I THINK WHAT- IT

01:14:50.853 --> 01:14:52.521
DEMONSTRATES HOPEFULLY TO THIS

01:14:52.588 --> 01:14:54.256

01:15:08.804 --> 01:15:09.972
IN IN MANY INSTANCES IT'S GOING

01:15:10.038 --> 01:15:13.041
TO BE- DEPENDING UPON. HOW THE

01:15:15.210 --> 01:15:17.546
IT. IT IS FIT FOR DIFFERENT

01:15:17.613 --> 01:15:19.548

IN THAT TYPE OF SETTING GIVEN

01:15:33.695 --> 01:15:36.198

HAVE A OF REFERENCED MULTIPLE

01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:40.629
TIMES THREE HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT

01:16:40.696 --> 01:16:42.564
PEOPLE CONVICTED AND SENTENCED

01:16:42.631 --> 01:16:45.000
TO DEATH SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY

01:16:45.067 --> 01:16:47.035
NINE HAVE BEEN EXONERATED. OF

01:16:47.102 --> 01:16:50.172
THESE 71% HAD BEEN CONVICTED

01:16:50.238 --> 01:16:53.041
THROUGH WHAT I'LL CALL I

01:16:53.108 --> 01:16:54.810
WITNESS MISIDENTIFICATION. AND

01:16:54.876 --> 01:16:56.912
IT SERVED AN AVERAGE OF

01:16:56.979 --> 01:16:57.579
FOURTEEN YEARS BEFORE THE

01:16:57.646 --> 01:16:59.915
EXONERATION. OF THOSE FALSE

01:16:59.982 --> 01:17:03.251

CROSS RACIAL MISIDENTIFICATION.

01:17:08.657 --> 01:17:09.191
TWO HUNDRED TWENTY ONE OF THE

THREE HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT THAT

01:17:09.858 --> 01:17:12.327
I- HAD JUST MENTIONED WERE

01:17:12.394 --> 01:17:16.264
BLACK. SO WE ASK THE QUESTION

01:17:16.331 --> 01:17:17.966
WHEN WE APPROACH SORT OF FUTURE

01:17:18.033 --> 01:17:20.135
USES IN AND OUR EVEN OUR

01:17:20.202 --> 01:17:20.602
CURRENT USAGE OF THIS

01:17:20.669 --> 01:17:22.671
TECHNOLOGY. WITH HIGH

01:17:22.738 --> 01:17:25.674
DEFINITION IMAGERY AND FACIAL

01:17:25.741 --> 01:17:28.210
LOW JUST SAY TOP TIER FACIAL

01:17:28.276 --> 01:17:30.145
RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGIES. COULD

01:17:30.212 --> 01:17:32.481
THE FATE OF THESE MOSTLY BLACK

01:17:32.547 --> 01:17:34.616
MEN HAVE CHANGED COULD THESE

01:17:34.683 --> 01:17:36.718
TECHNOLOGICAL TOOLS HAVE.

01:17:36.785 --> 01:17:38.286
REDIRECTED LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:17:38.353 --> 01:17:41.590

INNOCENT MEN WHO MAY OR MAY NOT

01:17:45.260 --> 01:17:47.396
HAVE BEEN IN PROXIMITY TO THE

01:17:47.462 --> 01:17:49.464
CRIME OF THE CRIME SCENE- IN

01:17:49.531 --> 01:17:51.433
OUR MIND THERE'S NOTHING WORSE

01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:53.168
IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF

01:17:53.235 --> 01:17:55.570
JUSTICE THAN. US UTILIZING

01:17:55.637 --> 01:17:59.074
TAXPAYER RESOURCES TO PURSUE

PROSECUTE AND CONVICT SOMEONE

01:18:06.081 --> 01:18:07.382
THAT WE WEREN'T EVEN REALLY

01:18:07.449 --> 01:18:10.285
TRYING TO CATCH IN RAISING THIS

01:18:10.352 --> 01:18:14.956
ISSUE. AND WE WONDER WHAT THE

01:18:15.023 --> 01:18:16.858
ROLE IS OF THIS TECHNOLOGY IN

01:18:16.925 --> 01:18:18.727
FACILITATING SORT OF A MORE

01:18:18.794 --> 01:18:21.063
EVEN RACIALLY JUST JUSTICE

01:18:21.129 --> 01:18:22.531
SYSTEM THAT DRASTICALLY LOWERS

01:18:22.597 --> 01:18:25.200
ARM MIS IDENTIFICATIONS HOW DO

01:18:25.267 --> 01:18:26.268
WE UTILIZE IT TO BE MORE

01:18:26.334 --> 01:18:28.336
PRECISE ACCURATE WITH OUR

01:18:28.403 --> 01:18:30.472
ACTIVITIES- SO THAT WE DON'T

01:18:30.539 --> 01:18:33.475
GET ACCUSED OF THINGS LIKE.

01:18:33.542 --> 01:18:36.244
OVER POLICING. IRRESPECTIVE OF

01:18:36.311 --> 01:18:37.879

OUR WORK- HOW DO WE LEVERAGED

01:18:44.386 --> 01:18:45.320
THE TECHNOLOGIES MYCOLOGIST

01:18:45.387 --> 01:18:47.456
MENTIONED TO DEAL WITH THE

01:18:47.522 --> 01:18:48.323
THOUSAND TENS OF THOUSANDS OF

MISSING ADULTS IN CALIFORNIA

01:18:50.158 --> 01:18:52.494
BUT ALSO TENSOF THOUSANDS. OF

01:18:52.561 --> 01:18:54.763
MISSING CHILDREN WERE NOT FULLY

01:18:54.830 --> 01:18:56.598
THERE YET IN LA COUNTY BUT IT

01:18:56.665 --> 01:18:58.733
IS IT IS TOP OF CONSCIENCE WILL

01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:01.203
PUT IT THAT WAY- FIFTEEN HERE

01:19:01.269 --> 01:19:02.137
BEING THAT WE WANT TO PREVENT

01:19:02.204 --> 01:19:03.939
CRIMES WANNA SOLVE CRIMES WE

01:19:04.005 --> 01:19:07.509
REALLY REUNITE MISSING PERSONS

01:19:07.576 --> 01:19:08.110
WE WANT TO REDUCE UNNECESSARY

01:19:08.176 --> 01:19:11.546
POOL. SERVE IN CAP. REDUCE X.

01:19:11.613 --> 01:19:14.116
IT UNNECESSARY EXPERIENCES WITH

01:19:14.182 --> 01:19:15.917
THE JUSTICE SYSTEM. AND

01:19:15.984 --> 01:19:18.320
INCREASE COMMUNITY CONFIDENCE.

01:19:18.386 --> 01:19:22.224
ARM I'LL CONCLUDE WITH-

01:19:22.290 --> 01:19:23.391
TOUCHING ON A COUPLE OF THE

01:19:23.458 --> 01:19:26.261
POINTS IN IN A LITTLE BIT MORE

01:19:26.328 --> 01:19:26.895
DETAIL THAT MY COLLEAGUES HAVE

01:19:26.962 --> 01:19:29.464
MENTIONED- WE'RE VERY CONCERNED

01:19:29.531 --> 01:19:33.535
ABOUT SOME OF THE- PROPAGANDA

01:19:33.602 --> 01:19:37.973
ASSOCIATED WITH- THE WITH THE

01:19:38.039 --> 01:19:39.641
USE OF THIS TECHNOLOGY. MANY OF

YOUR WHERE IT'S EASY YOU ALL OF

01:19:40.876 --> 01:19:42.310
CITED IT MISSED THE NATIONAL

01:19:42.377 --> 01:19:44.045
INSTITUTE OF STANDARDS AND

01:19:44.112 --> 01:19:46.348
TECHNOLOGY THEY REGULARLY

01:19:46.414 --> 01:19:48.483
EVALUATE THESE TECHNOLOGIES IN

01:19:48.550 --> 01:19:49.951
THEIR MOST RECENT REPORT

01:19:50.018 --> 01:19:52.888
RELEASED ONLY A FEW MONTHS AGO.

01:19:52.954 --> 01:19:54.589
THEY EVALUATED TWO HUNDRED

01:19:54.656 --> 01:19:56.091
RHYTHMS FROM NINETY NINE

01:19:56.158 --> 01:19:57.959
DEVELOPERS WHICH COMPRISES A

MAJORITY OF THE INDUSTRY- AND

01:20:00.595 --> 01:20:04.099
THIS IS GLOBALLY. MANY OF THEIR

01:20:04.166 --> 01:20:07.469
ALGORITHMS THAT THE- TESTED DID

01:20:07.536 --> 01:20:10.839
DISPLAY SOME BIAS. AND YOU KNOW

01:20:10.906 --> 01:20:12.707
NEW SET NEWS OUTLETS YOU KNOW

01:20:12.774 --> 01:20:15.243
TOOK THAT TO WRITE THEIR THEIR

THEIR STORIES TO BASICALLY

01:20:16.344 --> 01:20:18.380
CONCLUDE THAT ALL FACIAL

01:20:18.446 --> 01:20:19.648
RECOGNITION SOFTWARE WAS THE

01:20:19.714 --> 01:20:21.550
SAME IN ALL FACIAL RECOGNITION

01:20:21.616 --> 01:20:24.920
SOFTWARE WAS IN SOME WAY SHAPE

01:20:24.986 --> 01:20:26.855
OR FORM RACIST OR SEXIST- BUT

01:20:26.922 --> 01:20:29.558
IF YOU PAY YOUR INSIDE THE

01:20:29.624 --> 01:20:31.526
REPORT. IT HIGHLIGHTS THAT AS

01:20:31.593 --> 01:20:33.762
MY **** MENTION THE MOST

01:20:33.828 --> 01:20:36.031
ACCURATE ALGORITHMS HAD DO HAVE

01:20:36.097 --> 01:20:38.133
UNDETECTABLE- DIFFERENCES

01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:40.302
BETWEEN DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS AND

01:20:40.368 --> 01:20:42.604
IT'S STILL WORTH STATING IN OUR

01:20:42.671 --> 01:20:45.974
OPINION THAT. ARM WHEN YOU LOOK

01:20:46.041 --> 01:20:47.876
AT WHEN YOU CONTRAST THE

01:20:47.943 --> 01:20:51.746
ACCURACY. OF EVEN THE MID TIER

01:20:51.813 --> 01:20:53.815
NOT THAT WE WOULD EVEN WANT TO

01:20:53.882 --> 01:20:55.016
APPROACH YOUR MID TIER

01:20:55.083 --> 01:20:57.786
TECHNOLOGIES BUT IF YOU IF YOU

01:20:57.852 --> 01:21:00.322
CONTRAST MID TIER TECHNOLOGIES

01:21:00.388 --> 01:21:03.124
WITH. THE HISTORIC PRACTICES OF

01:21:03.191 --> 01:21:06.361
LAW ENFORCEMENT. BOMB THOSE MID

01:21:06.428 --> 01:21:07.395
TIER TECHNOLOGIES ARE

01:21:07.462 --> 01:21:09.764
INFINITELY MORE ACCURATE THAN

01:21:09.831 --> 01:21:12.100
OUR OLD SCHOOL WAYS SO THAT'S

01:21:12.167 --> 01:21:14.869
WHY OF MISTER CHAIRMAN WHEN THE

01:21:14.936 --> 01:21:17.138
FICTITIOUS CLAIM STARTED LAST

01:21:17.205 --> 01:21:20.275
YEAR ALLEGE THAT. 20% OF

01:21:20.342 --> 01:21:20.709
LEGISLATORS HAD BEEN

01:21:20.775 --> 01:21:24.346
MISIDENTIFIED. IT IMMEDIATELY

01:21:24.412 --> 01:21:26.081
IT PROVOKED- I THINK A LOT OF

01:21:26.147 --> 01:21:27.949
QUESTIONS ON OUR SIDE THAT WE

01:21:28.016 --> 01:21:30.518
ATTEMPTED TO DIALOGUE ABOUT BUT

01:21:30.585 --> 01:21:32.587
UNFORTUNATELY DIDN'T HAVE A

01:21:32.654 --> 01:21:35.090
WILLING RECIPIENT DIALOGUE-

01:21:35.156 --> 01:21:36.224
WHERE DID YOU SET THE ACCURACY

01:21:36.291 --> 01:21:38.226
THRESHOLDS FOR THE SOFTWARE.

01:21:38.293 --> 01:21:39.761
WHAT WAS THE POLICY OF THE

01:21:39.828 --> 01:21:41.997
IMAGES OF THE LEGISLATORS THAT

01:21:42.063 --> 01:21:44.766
YOU USE. ARM WHAT WAS THE

01:21:44.833 --> 01:21:46.835
QUALITY OF THESE. MYSTERIOUS

01:21:46.901 --> 01:21:48.703
PUBLIC DATABASE THAT YOU

01:21:48.770 --> 01:21:50.839
UTILIZE BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT

01:21:50.905 --> 01:21:52.307
CRIMINAL OFFENDER RECORD

01:21:52.374 --> 01:21:55.644
INFORMATION- IS CONFIDENTIAL IS

01:21:55.710 --> 01:21:57.112
ONLY USED FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:21:57.178 --> 01:22:00.081
PURPOSES SO. AND WE CAN VOUCH

01:22:00.148 --> 01:22:01.816
FOR THE QUALITY OF THE DATA

01:22:01.883 --> 01:22:04.819
THAT IS INSERTED INTO THAT

01:22:04.886 --> 01:22:07.255
SYSTEM WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE

01:22:07.322 --> 01:22:10.492
DATABASE THAT WAS USED ARM WE

01:22:10.558 --> 01:22:10.959
DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE

01:22:11.026 --> 01:22:13.895
METHODOLOGY. DID RECEIVE IT TO

01:22:13.962 --> 01:22:14.796
THOSE QUESTIONS AND THEN MORE

01:22:14.863 --> 01:22:17.866
IMPORTANTLY. ARM DID WE USE TOP

01:22:17.932 --> 01:22:19.834
TIER FACIAL RECOGNITION

01:22:19.901 --> 01:22:22.837
TECHNOLOGY AND ALGORITHMS- AS

01:22:22.904 --> 01:22:25.440
JUDGE BY NEST OR DID WE

01:22:25.507 --> 01:22:29.511
SOMETHING ELSE SO. EVEN IN THE

01:22:29.577 --> 01:22:31.112
EVENT THAT LET'S JUST SAY

01:22:31.179 --> 01:22:32.580
HYPOTHETICALLY ALL OF THE

01:22:32.647 --> 01:22:38.953
TECHNOLOGIES. ARM WERE 20%

01:22:39.020 --> 01:22:39.387
INACCURATE FOR THIS

01:22:39.454 --> 01:22:41.923
HYPOTHETICAL IF WE HAVE TO

01:22:41.990 --> 01:22:44.326
CHOOSE BETWEEN THE 71%

01:22:44.392 --> 01:22:47.796
MISIDENTIFICATION NUMBER- OF

01:22:47.862 --> 01:22:49.097
THOSE WHO ARE FALSELY ACCUSED

01:22:49.164 --> 01:22:53.234
AND SENTENCED. TO DEATH ARM OR

01:22:53.301 --> 01:22:58.139
OUR HYPOTHETICAL 20% ARM IF WE

01:22:58.206 --> 01:22:59.207
HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY IN THIS

01:22:59.274 --> 01:23:01.142
THIS FALSE HYPOTHETICAL TO CUT

01:23:01.209 --> 01:23:02.477
THE NUMBER OF WRONGLY

01:23:02.544 --> 01:23:04.179
INCARCERATED PEOPLE BUT MORE

01:23:04.245 --> 01:23:07.015
THAN 65% WE WOULD JUST ASK THE

01:23:07.082 --> 01:23:10.185
QUESTION WHY THE STATUS QUO. I

01:23:10.251 --> 01:23:11.519
THINK FORTUNATELY FOR YOU ALL

01:23:11.586 --> 01:23:13.121
YOU DON'T TO CHOOSE BETWEEN A

01:23:13.188 --> 01:23:15.623
FALSE DICHOTOMY THERE ARE A LOT

01:23:15.690 --> 01:23:17.492
OF TECHNOLOGIES AND TOOLS OF

01:23:17.559 --> 01:23:19.461
BILLABLE THAT MUCH ACCURATE ARM

01:23:19.527 --> 01:23:21.162
WE SEE THIS AS AN IN THE GATE

01:23:21.229 --> 01:23:22.864
OF TOOL OUT THAT'LL LEAD US TO

01:23:22.931 --> 01:23:24.933
THE RIGHT INVEST IF PASSED THE

01:23:24.999 --> 01:23:28.703
TECHNOLOGY BY ITSELF. ARMED IS

01:23:28.770 --> 01:23:31.005
NOT GIVE US PROBLEMS BECAUSE WE

01:23:31.072 --> 01:23:33.141
AGREED TO IN A MINUTE TO BE

01:23:33.208 --> 01:23:36.544
PLACED IN THE LAW I SEE THAT.

01:23:36.611 --> 01:23:38.213
THE TECHNOLOGY SHOULD WILL NOT

01:23:38.279 --> 01:23:39.581
IN AND OF IT DOUBLES PROBABLE

01:23:39.647 --> 01:23:42.584
CAUSE WE UNDERSTAND THAT REAL

01:23:42.650 --> 01:23:43.651
INVESTIGATIVE WORK NEEDS TO BE

01:23:43.718 --> 01:23:45.954
DONE- WE HAVE TO PROVE TO A

01:23:46.020 --> 01:23:48.590
JURY BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT-

01:23:48.656 --> 01:23:51.359
IN IN THAT IS ALL THE A COMPASS

01:23:51.426 --> 01:23:53.061
THAT I HAVE HERE TODAY

01:23:53.128 --> 01:23:53.528
AVAILABLE TO TAKE ANY

01:23:53.595 --> 01:23:55.230
QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH

01:23:55.296 --> 01:23:55.930
THANK YOU REYES OF LEGITIMATE

01:23:55.997 --> 01:23:57.499
QUESTION MY HOPE IS OUT MAYBE

THE P. R. PALETTE THE NEXT TWO

01:23:59.801 --> 01:24:01.403
PANELS WOULD ADDRESS THE

01:24:01.469 --> 01:24:03.705
ISSUES. AND WITHOUT THAT I LIKE

01:24:03.772 --> 01:24:05.273
TO OPEN UP FOR QUESTIONS OR

01:24:05.340 --> 01:24:08.009
COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS.

01:24:08.076 --> 01:24:11.079
THE LOOK AT THE SERVICE RIGHT.

01:24:11.146 --> 01:24:13.615
THANK YOU- FOR A YEAR

BEING USED FOR. LAWN FOR

01:34:33.968 --> 01:34:37.638
PURPOSES. TO BE CLEAR. THE DISK

01:34:37.705 --> 01:34:39.173
ABOUT TO GET REALIZE INTO SOME.

01:34:39.240 --> 01:34:41.542
THAT PROBE WERE OF. DEPENDING

01:34:41.609 --> 01:34:43.377
ON THE SEARCH. A PERSON MAY

01:34:43.444 --> 01:34:44.378
HAVE A FIRST AND FOURTH

01:34:44.445 --> 01:34:46.147
AMENDMENT CLAIM THAT WOULD MAKE

01:34:46.213 --> 01:34:48.482
THE INITIAL COLLECTION OF THE

01:34:48.549 --> 01:34:50.818
PHOTO UNCONSTITUTIONAL. SO

01:34:50.885 --> 01:34:51.952
BEFORE RUNNING A SEARCH LAW

01:34:52.019 --> 01:34:53.120
ENFORCEMENT MUST ENSURE THAT

01:34:53.187 --> 01:34:54.989
THE PROBE PHOTO WILL LEAD TO A

01:34:55.056 --> 01:34:56.690
VIABLE RISK MATCH. PRO PHOTOS

01:34:56.757 --> 01:34:58.426
ARE GENERALLY TAKEN UNDER LESS

01:34:58.492 --> 01:35:00.194
THAN IDEAL CIRCUMSTANCES THEY

01:35:00.261 --> 01:35:01.862
MAY BE BLURRY THEY CAN BE TAKEN

01:35:01.929 --> 01:35:03.798
AND ANGLE THE LIGHTING MAY BE

01:35:03.864 --> 01:35:05.433
BAD THE PERSON'S EYES MIGHT BE

01:35:05.499 --> 01:35:06.867
CLOSED OR THEIR FACE MIGHT BE

01:35:06.934 --> 01:35:08.502
OBSCURED ALL OF THESE SORTS OF

01:35:08.569 --> 01:35:10.037
ISSUES MAKE THE SOFTWARE LESS

01:35:10.104 --> 01:35:11.872
ACCURATE. LAW ENFORCEMENT WILL

01:35:11.939 --> 01:35:13.707
REGULARLY MANIPULATE PRO PHOTOS

01:35:13.774 --> 01:35:15.409
SO THE SOFTWARE IS MORE LIKELY

01:35:15.476 --> 01:35:17.578
TO FIND A MATCH AND IN DOING

01:35:17.645 --> 01:35:19.146
SO- POLICE MAY INTRODUCED BY A

SEIZE OR INACCURACIES INTO THE

01:35:20.848 --> 01:35:23.084
ORIGINAL IMAGE. FOR EXAMPLE IF

01:35:23.150 --> 01:35:25.419
OMEONE'S EYES ARE CLOSED AND

01:35:25.486 --> 01:35:26.287
LAW ENFORCEMENT ADDS EYES TO

01:35:26.353 --> 01:35:27.588
THE PICTURE THEY HAVE NO WAY OF

01:35:27.655 --> 01:35:31.225
KNOWING WHAT COLOR EYES THE

01:35:31.292 --> 01:35:33.260
ACTUAL PERSON IN THE PHOTO HAS.

01:35:33.327 --> 01:35:34.962
THEN LAW ENFORCEMENT RUNS THE

01:35:35.029 --> 01:35:36.497
SEARCH. WHETHER AN AGENT MUST

01:35:36.564 --> 01:35:37.965
BE TRAINED AND WHAT TRAINING IS

01:35:38.032 --> 01:35:39.567

01:35:41.669 --> 01:35:43.404
NOT BE. THE SAME IS TRUE FOR

01:35:43.471 --> 01:35:44.872
VARIOUS TECHNICAL THRESHOLD FOR

01:35:44.939 --> 01:35:46.540
DEFINING A MATCH. AND FOR WHICH

01:35:46.607 --> 01:35:48.342
CRIMES FACIAL RECOGNITION CAN

01:35:48.409 --> 01:35:49.310
BE USED TO DURING THE

INVESTIGATION. THE SOFTWARE

01:35:51.879 --> 01:35:53.514
COMPARES THE PRO PHOTO TO THE

PRETRIAL ISSUES LIKE THIS. I

01:38:35.943 --> 01:38:37.144
MEAN IF YOU COURTS OF HAD THE

01:39:05.372 --> 01:39:07.074
AGAIN BECAUSE LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:39:07.141 --> 01:39:08.242
SO FAR GENERALLY CONCEDES THE

DIFFICULT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO

HAVE BEEN SLOW IN COMING AS A

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.336

01:39:44.311 --> 01:39:46.080
BECAUSE FORCE CAN CHOOSE SHIELD

01:39:46.146 --> 01:39:47.815
THE TECHNOLOGY FROM QUEST BY IN

01:39:47.881 --> 01:39:49.249
FOR ONLY THE I WOULD I DONE IT

01:39:49.316 --> 01:39:52.219
EVENTUALLY. THESE WE COMPLEX

01:39:52.286 --> 01:39:54.254
ARE NOT EASY TO FIX EVEN THEY

01:39:54.321 --> 01:39:56.924
MAY SEEM LIKE SIMPLE FIXES

01:39:56.990 --> 01:39:58.392
THEY'RE INTERLOCKING AND THE

01:40:07.534 --> 01:40:08.669
THIS I WOULD ENCOURAGE ALLEGE

01:40:08.736 --> 01:40:10.971
THE LAW. TO TAKE TIME AND CARE

01:40:11.038 --> 01:40:12.639
TO CRAFT A REGULATORY REGIME

01:40:12.706 --> 01:40:14.108
BUT ADEQUATELY SAFEGUARDS

01:40:14.174 --> 01:40:15.943
CALIFORNIANS CIVIL LIBERTIES

01:40:16.009 --> 01:40:18.846

FACE RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY

01:40:20.581 --> 01:40:22.082
SIMPLY COMES WITH TOO MANY

01:40:22.149 --> 01:40:23.250
RISKS TO CRIMINAL DEFENDANTS

01:40:23.317 --> 01:40:25.552

ONE WAY TO DO THAT BY PASSING A

01:48:04.411 --> 01:48:06.079
MORATORIUM NOW. THANK YOU FOR

01:48:06.146 --> 01:48:08.315
OF IT ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK AND

01:48:08.381 --> 01:48:10.050
I WELCOME ANY QUESTIONS THANK

01:48:10.116 --> 01:48:11.451
YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR

01:48:11.518 --> 01:48:12.085
PRESENTATIONS WITHOUT THE LIKE

01:48:12.152 --> 01:48:13.253
TO OPEN UP FOR QUESTIONS

01:48:13.320 --> 01:48:15.255
COMMENTS MISTER NO THE CUP.

01:48:15.322 --> 01:48:16.256
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR LIKE TO

01:48:16.323 --> 01:48:17.357
THANK YOU BOTH FOR YOUR

01:48:17.424 --> 01:48:22.229
TESTIMONY. YOU KNOW I IT'S

01:48:22.295 --> 01:48:22.829
INTERESTING WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

01:48:22.896 --> 01:48:25.699
THE ETHICAL RAMIFICATIONS OF

01:48:25.765 --> 01:48:27.434
FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY-

01:48:27.500 --> 01:48:29.703
I. YOU KNOW I THINK WE NEED TO

01:48:29.769 --> 01:48:32.505
DISTINGUISH. PHILOSOPHICALLY

01:48:32.572 --> 01:48:33.907
THE THINGS THAT ARE DIFFERENT

01:48:33.974 --> 01:48:36.009
ABOUT FRT THAT YOU KNOW WE ARE

01:48:36.076 --> 01:48:36.910
ARE BRING UP ISSUES THAT WE

01:48:36.977 --> 01:48:39.512
HAVEN'T FACED BEFORE SO- YOU'RE

01:48:39.579 --> 01:48:40.981
ONE OF THOSE ISSUES MY MIND IS

01:48:41.047 --> 01:48:42.983
WHETHER OR NOT THE PUBLIC HAS A

01:48:43.049 --> 01:48:44.651
REASONABLE EXPECTATION OF

01:48:44.718 --> 01:48:45.719
PRIVACY WHEN THEY'RE IN A-

01:48:45.785 --> 01:48:46.853
PLACE. BECAUSE RIGHT NOW WE

01:48:46.920 --> 01:48:48.655
KNOW WANT TO STAND THAT FOR

01:48:48.722 --> 01:48:50.290
EXAMPLE BARKING AT HAVE A

01:48:50.357 --> 01:48:52.325
SURVEILLANCE CAMERA- THAT

01:48:52.392 --> 01:48:54.060
RECORDS THE PATRONS TO COME

01:48:54.127 --> 01:48:55.061
INTO THE BAR NO ONE IS SAYING

01:48:55.128 --> 01:48:56.830
THAT A BAR SHOULDN'T COOPERATE

01:48:56.897 --> 01:48:59.833
WITH OTHER BARS AND- SHARING A

01:48:59.900 --> 01:49:01.368
NO A LIST- YOU KNOW PICTURES OF

01:49:01.434 --> 01:49:02.802
KNOWN TROUBLEMAKERS SO THAT THE

01:49:02.869 --> 01:49:04.638
OTHER BARS- COULD POTENTIALLY.

01:49:04.704 --> 01:49:06.539
NOT ALLOW THE PEOPLE INTO THE

01:49:06.606 --> 01:49:08.174
ESTABLISHMENT SO I'M WONDERING

01:49:08.241 --> 01:49:10.043
YOU KNOW WHY WHAT'S DIFFERENT

01:49:10.110 --> 01:49:11.912
ABOUT THIS APPLICATION THAT

01:49:11.978 --> 01:49:13.179
JUST BECAUSE IT'S DONE IN AN

01:49:13.246 --> 01:49:15.782
AUTOMATED WAY MAKES YOU THINK

01:49:15.849 --> 01:49:17.384
THAT PEOPLE CIVIL LIBERTIES ARE

01:49:17.450 --> 01:49:20.520
BEING IMPACTED. ENERGY LIKE.

01:49:20.587 --> 01:49:22.856
I'M I THINK THAT PART OF IT IS

01:49:22.923 --> 01:49:25.492
AN AUTOMATED WAY IF SOMEONE IS

01:49:25.558 --> 01:49:26.826
LOOKING AT SURVEILLANCE TAPES

01:49:26.893 --> 01:49:28.628
FOR EXAMPLE IT TAKES A LOT OF

01:49:28.695 --> 01:49:31.031
PEOPLE POWER TO SORT THROUGH

01:49:31.097 --> 01:49:33.600
THE HOURS OF TAPES TO TRY AND

01:49:33.667 --> 01:49:35.869
IDENTIFY EVERYONE IN THEM WARES

01:49:35.936 --> 01:49:37.737
FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY-

01:49:37.804 --> 01:49:39.539
ALLOWS FOLKS THAT TO HAPPEN IN

01:49:39.606 --> 01:49:42.309
REAL TIME QUICKLY WITHOUT A LOT

01:49:42.375 --> 01:49:44.110
OF STAFF POWER AND SO IT.

01:49:44.177 --> 01:49:45.712
AMPLIFIES THE ABILITY TO

01:49:45.779 --> 01:49:48.515
SURVEIL PEOPLE AND IDENTIFY

01:49:48.581 --> 01:49:49.783
THEM IN PRIVATE SPACES WHICH IS

01:49:49.849 --> 01:49:51.184
RIDICULOUSLY TROUBLING WHEN

01:49:51.251 --> 01:49:53.653
COMBINED WITH BLACK LISTS THAT

01:49:53.720 --> 01:49:54.888
PEOPLE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO

01:49:54.955 --> 01:49:56.823
KNOW WHY THERE ON THOSE LISTS

01:49:56.890 --> 01:49:58.925
AND MIGHT- AND THAT THE FOLKS

01:49:58.992 --> 01:50:00.360
THAT CREATE THE LESS MIGHT ALSO

01:50:00.427 --> 01:50:02.295
NOT BE ABLE TO DETERMINE WHY

01:50:02.362 --> 01:50:04.664
SOMEONE WAS BLACKLISTED IF THEY

01:50:04.731 --> 01:50:07.200
ARE NOT ABLE TO UNDERSTAND. WHY

01:50:07.267 --> 01:50:08.635
THAT THE ALGORITHM BEHIND THE

01:50:08.702 --> 01:50:10.270
TECHNOLOGY BUT I DON'T HAVE

01:50:10.337 --> 01:50:12.038
THAT PROBLEM NOW AND SOMEONE

01:50:12.105 --> 01:50:13.773
COULD BE BLACKLISTED FROM A BAR

01:50:13.840 --> 01:50:14.574
BASED ON A PICTURE THAT WAS

01:50:14.641 --> 01:50:16.643
TAKEN UP OUR NAKED PROTECT THE

01:50:16.710 --> 01:50:21.448
TRUTH YEARS AGO RIGHT- HOW. HAS

01:50:21.514 --> 01:50:23.183
ELEVEN THAT'S ALL OF A BIGGER

01:50:23.249 --> 01:50:24.150
AND IF I AM FOR EXAMPLE

01:50:24.217 --> 01:50:26.152
BLACKLISTED AT A BAR I AND

01:50:26.219 --> 01:50:27.921
YOU'RE THE PERSON NOT LETTING

01:50:27.988 --> 01:50:29.756
ME AND I COULD ASK YOU. AND YOU

01:50:29.823 --> 01:50:31.791
WOULD BE ABLE TO SAY WE GOT

01:50:31.858 --> 01:50:33.860
YOUR PICTURE FROM THIS BAR AND

01:50:33.927 --> 01:50:37.163
THEY BLACKLISTED YOU AND I

01:50:37.230 --> 01:50:37.764
COULD GO TO THEM AND SAY. WHY

01:50:37.831 --> 01:50:39.566
WAS I. AND SOMEONE THERE WOULD

01:50:39.632 --> 01:50:41.201
KNOW THE ANSWER WHERE AS IF

01:50:41.267 --> 01:50:42.002
WE'RE RUNNING FACIAL

01:50:42.068 --> 01:50:43.236
RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY IT COULD

01:50:43.303 --> 01:50:45.071
JUST BE THAT MY PHOTO WAS

01:50:45.138 --> 01:50:47.240
MISIDENTIFIED. AND FLAGGED AS

01:50:47.307 --> 01:50:49.909
SOMEONE WHO I'M NOT. AND THE

01:50:49.976 --> 01:50:51.244
PERSON RUNNING THE TECHNOLOGY

01:50:51.311 --> 01:50:53.213
MAY NOT KNOW THE ANSWER THEY

01:50:53.279 --> 01:50:54.814
WOULD JUST SAY THAT YOU'RE DONE

01:50:54.881 --> 01:50:56.349
AND I KNOW. THAT WAS TRUE

01:50:56.416 --> 01:50:57.584
THIRTY YEARS AGO THE PERSON

01:50:57.650 --> 01:50:59.319
LOOKING AT THE PICTURE COULD

01:50:59.386 --> 01:51:00.253
HAVE MISIDENTIFIED YOU I'M JUST

01:51:00.320 --> 01:51:01.488
A- YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S

01:51:01.554 --> 01:51:02.922
IMPORTANT TO DISTINGUISH. THE

01:51:02.989 --> 01:51:06.092
THING THAT ARE FUNDAMENTALLY

01:51:06.159 --> 01:51:06.659
YOU KNOW ETHICALLY DIFFERENT

01:51:06.726 --> 01:51:07.861
FROM THE APPLICATION OF TESTIS

01:51:07.927 --> 01:51:11.131
TECHNO. TO THE SOCIETAL NORMS

01:51:11.197 --> 01:51:12.165
WE'VE ESTABLISHED ALREADY

01:51:12.232 --> 01:51:13.666
PERHAPS IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO

01:51:13.733 --> 01:51:16.269
LOOK AT A DIFFERENT EXAMPLE SO

01:51:16.336 --> 01:51:17.670
FOR EXAMPLE. I HAVE PHOTOS ARE

01:51:17.737 --> 01:51:19.773
ELDERLY AGAIN AT- PROTEST AND

01:51:19.839 --> 01:51:21.875
RALLIES WE SEE THEM ON THE NEWS

01:51:21.941 --> 01:51:24.210
CENTER- NO ONE IS SITTING THERE

01:51:24.277 --> 01:51:25.678
AT THE END OF FINE WHO EXACTLY

01:51:25.745 --> 01:51:28.481
IS IN EACH OTHER'S BUT IT'S

01:51:28.548 --> 01:51:30.950
WITH BASS. RECOGNITION IT IS

01:51:31.017 --> 01:51:34.988
POSSIBLE TO. FIND ANY THE

01:51:35.055 --> 01:51:38.158
PEOPLE. AND SO IT'S SCALE OF.

01:51:38.224 --> 01:51:44.564
THE THAT. THE. I MEAN I'M

01:51:44.631 --> 01:51:45.532
STRUCK WITH THIS OKAY SO IF

01:51:45.598 --> 01:51:46.933
THOUGHT SHE TO ATTACK A RALLY.

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:48.601
YOU KNOW A- NO. THAT PHOTO

01:51:48.668 --> 01:51:50.036
BEFORE GRAY ARE BEING TO AT THE

01:51:50.103 --> 01:51:50.970
RALLY. I HAVE A REASONABLE LIKE.

01:51:51.037 --> 01:51:51.571
THAT SOMEONE'S NOT GOING TO BE

01:51:51.638 --> 01:51:52.172
ABLE TO TAKE A PICTURE. AND I

01:51:52.238 --> 01:51:53.239
DO. THAT I WAS AT THAT RALLY

01:51:53.306 --> 01:51:54.874
RIGHT THAT WAS TRUE THIRTY

01:51:54.941 --> 01:51:56.009
YEARS AGO IT'S TRUE NOW. YOU

01:51:56.076 --> 01:51:57.944
KNOW I'VE GIVEN UP THEIR

01:51:58.011 --> 01:52:00.080
EXPECTATION OF PRIVACY BY GOING

01:52:00.146 --> 01:52:01.448
TO A RALLY THE PUBLIC PLACE. SO

01:52:01.514 --> 01:52:03.016
I MEAN I DON'T UNDERSTAND

01:52:03.083 --> 01:52:04.417
WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT. FACIAL

01:52:04.484 --> 01:52:05.885
RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY OTHER

01:52:05.952 --> 01:52:07.353
THAN IT'S EASIER NOW THAN IT

01:52:07.420 --> 01:52:09.122
USED TO BE. BUT I MEAN

01:52:09.189 --> 01:52:09.756
ETHICALLY THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO

01:52:09.823 --> 01:52:11.157
BE TO BE DISTINCTION. I AM I

01:52:11.224 --> 01:52:12.358
WOULD DISAGREE WITH YOUR

01:52:12.425 --> 01:52:13.893
CLASSIFICATION OF GIVING UP

01:52:13.960 --> 01:52:15.628
THEIR RIGHT TO PRIVACY SIMPLY

01:52:15.695 --> 01:52:17.097
BY BEING OUT IN THE PUBLIC I

01:52:17.163 --> 01:52:18.531
THINK THAT THE CONSTITUTION IN.

01:52:18.598 --> 01:52:19.466
PARTICULAR THE CALIFORNIA

01:52:19.532 --> 01:52:21.668
CONSTITUTION. WHICH

01:52:21.734 --> 01:52:23.203
SPECIFICALLY LESS OUT THE RIGHT

01:52:23.269 --> 01:52:25.505
TO PRIVACY. WOULD ALLOW FOR US

01:52:25.572 --> 01:52:26.873
TO CONTINUE TO HAVE A RIGHT TO

01:52:26.940 --> 01:52:28.808
PRIVACY EVEN WHEN WE ACCESS OUR

01:52:28.875 --> 01:52:32.011
HOUSE. OR IN PUBLIC SPACES. I

01:52:32.078 --> 01:52:33.379
MEAN THAT THAT'S THAT TO ME

01:52:33.446 --> 01:52:34.547
WHAT WHAT YOU JUST SAID IS THAT

01:52:34.614 --> 01:52:36.182
GOES TO THE HEART OF. YOU KNOW

01:52:36.249 --> 01:52:37.450
THE THIS PHILOSOPHICAL

01:52:37.517 --> 01:52:38.618
DISCUSSION THAT WE'RE HAVING

01:52:38.685 --> 01:52:39.452
AND I THINK THAT'S THE ISSUE

01:52:39.519 --> 01:52:40.320
THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO

01:52:40.386 --> 01:52:41.888
GRAPPLE WITH. AS A SOCIETY OF

01:52:41.955 --> 01:52:43.289
YOU KNOW WHAT MAKES THIS

01:52:43.356 --> 01:52:45.125
PARTICULAR SITUATION. DIFFERENT

01:52:45.191 --> 01:52:46.926
AT IT BUT BUT I YOU KNOW I

01:52:46.993 --> 01:52:48.962
STRUGGLE WITH THAT. MYSELF BUT

01:52:49.028 --> 01:52:50.964
I MEAN I THINK WE BALANCE THAT.

01:52:51.030 --> 01:52:53.032
AGAINST THE SOCIETAL GOOD THAT

01:52:53.099 --> 01:52:55.068
WE THAT CAN BE. BROUGHT ABOUT

01:52:55.135 --> 01:52:56.669
BY THE USE OF THIS TECHNOLOGY.

01:52:56.736 --> 01:52:58.838
SO I WAS ONLY ABLE WHAT DID YOU

01:52:58.905 --> 01:53:01.174
HAVE DISCUSSIONS. I'LL CUT

01:53:01.241 --> 01:53:03.643
MISCALCULATED. SO I AND YOU CAN

01:53:03.710 --> 01:53:04.744
COUNT ME AMONG THE EIGHTY SOME

01:53:04.811 --> 01:53:07.147
PERCENT OF AMERICANS WHO DON'T

01:53:07.213 --> 01:53:07.881
WANT THE GOVERNMENT MONITORING

01:53:07.947 --> 01:53:09.582
AND TRACKING ME I KIND OF

01:53:09.649 --> 01:53:10.750
WONDER ABOUT THE TEN PLUS

01:53:10.817 --> 01:53:13.586
PERCENT WHO DO ON THAT- HOWEVER

01:53:13.653 --> 01:53:14.921
I'M NOT SURE I QUITE UNDERSTAND

01:53:14.988 --> 01:53:16.556
THE ACLU'S OPPOSITION WHICH AS

01:53:16.623 --> 01:53:17.991
FAR AS I UNDERSTAND THIS KIND

01:53:18.057 --> 01:53:20.527
OF A WHOLESALE- MORATORIUM ON

01:53:20.593 --> 01:53:22.562
THE TECHNOLOGY ITSELF I MEAN

01:53:22.629 --> 01:53:23.863
THERE'S YOU KNOW WITH ANY

01:53:23.930 --> 01:53:25.131
TECHNOLOGY AND SHE CAN COME UP

01:53:25.198 --> 01:53:26.900
WITH AN ENDLESS LIST OF-

01:53:26.966 --> 01:53:30.236
POTENTIALLY MALICIOUS- USES AND

01:53:30.303 --> 01:53:31.938
GENERALLY WE TRY TO. REGULATE

01:53:32.005 --> 01:53:34.274
OR PROHIBIT THOSE PARTICULAR

01:53:34.340 --> 01:53:36.543
MALICIOUS USES- AS OPPOSED TO

01:53:36.609 --> 01:53:38.945
JUST- YOU KNOW BAND THE

01:53:39.012 --> 01:53:41.114
TECHNOLOGY ITSELF SO YOU KNOW

01:53:41.181 --> 01:53:42.015
WHAT IS IT ABOUT THIS

01:53:42.081 --> 01:53:43.082
TECHNOLOGIES KIND OF SIMILAR TO

01:53:43.149 --> 01:53:45.385
MR OBERNOLTE IS QUESTION AT

01:53:45.451 --> 01:53:47.487
THAT IS SO DISTINCTIVE SUCH

01:53:47.554 --> 01:53:48.688
THAT YOU KNOW WHAT THAT WINDS

01:53:48.755 --> 01:53:51.191
GOVERNMENT YOU

01:53:51.257 --> 01:53:53.026
JUST AUTOMATICALLY FOLLOW WHAT

01:53:53.092 --> 01:53:55.261
WE- TAKE AN APPROACH THAT'S A

01:53:55.328 --> 01:53:57.330
LITTLE MORE FOCUSED AND WE'LL

01:53:57.397 --> 01:54:00.133
GET WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR

01:54:00.200 --> 01:54:01.401
ABUSES EXIST. SO I BELIEVE THAT

01:54:01.467 --> 01:54:03.203
LIKE MOST LEGISLATORS AND THAT

01:54:03.269 --> 01:54:05.171
WITHOUT IMMEDIATE ACTION.

01:54:05.238 --> 01:54:06.806
GOVERNMENT AND CORPORATE USE A

01:54:06.873 --> 01:54:08.241
FACIAL RECOGNITION DOES HAVE

01:54:08.308 --> 01:54:10.677
THE CAPACITY TO KIND OF SPIRAL

01:54:10.743 --> 01:54:11.678
OUT OF CONTROL WITH SOME OF

01:54:11.744 --> 01:54:13.913
THOSE- SITUATIONS THAT YOU FEEL

01:54:13.980 --> 01:54:15.982
LIKE. TO CROSS THE BORDER OF

01:54:16.049 --> 01:54:17.684
WANTING TO OF BEING TRACKED ALL

01:54:17.750 --> 01:54:19.886
THE TIME FOR EXAMPLE- AND SO

01:54:19.953 --> 01:54:21.588
IT'S PRUDENT TO TAKE A PAUSE.

01:54:21.654 --> 01:54:23.223
WITH THE MORATORIUM AND

01:54:23.289 --> 01:54:25.758
CONSIDER THE IMPLICATIONS FOR

01:54:25.825 --> 01:54:27.760
OUR FREEDOMS OUR SAFETY AND OUR

01:54:27.827 --> 01:54:30.530
DEMOCRACY AND FIGURE OUT. IF

01:54:30.597 --> 01:54:32.699
THERE ARE ANY SUCH USES THAT

01:54:32.765 --> 01:54:34.634
MIGHT BE ACCEPTABLE FOR FACIAL

01:54:34.701 --> 01:54:38.404
RECOGNITION BECAUSE- THERE ARE.

01:54:38.471 --> 01:54:41.007
REAL BENEFITS THAT I- AND

01:54:41.074 --> 01:54:42.342
EITHER NO REAL REST OR THE

01:54:42.408 --> 01:54:43.943
OUTWEIGH THE REAL BREASTS BUT

01:54:44.010 --> 01:54:46.145
RIGHT NOW TO TAKE A PAUSE. SO

01:54:46.212 --> 01:54:47.747
THAT TECHNOLOGY IS NOT BEING

01:54:47.814 --> 01:54:48.748
DEPLOYED IN THESE DANGEROUS AND

01:54:48.815 --> 01:54:50.450
HARMFUL WAYS SO IT SOUNDS LIKE

01:54:50.516 --> 01:54:51.651
YOU MORE OR LESS AGREE WITH MY

01:54:51.718 --> 01:54:52.986
APPROACHED. TIMIDLY WE SHOULD

01:54:53.052 --> 01:54:56.222
BE. REGULATING ON THAT YOU KNOW

01:54:56.289 --> 01:54:57.490
CASE BY CASE OUR APPLICATION

01:54:57.557 --> 01:54:58.958
BASED YOU KNOW BASIS AS

01:54:59.025 --> 01:55:00.960
OPPOSED. BUT BUT YOU THINK THAT

01:55:01.027 --> 01:55:02.295
THE TECHNOLOGY IS KIND OF GOT

01:55:02.362 --> 01:55:02.929
AND THE HEAD OF OUR

01:55:02.996 --> 01:55:04.430
UNDERSTANDING SO WE NEED TO.

01:55:04.497 --> 01:55:05.531
CREATE SPACE FOR THOSE

01:55:05.598 --> 01:55:06.799
DECISIONS TO BE MADE IS THAT

01:55:06.866 --> 01:55:09.068
THE- I'M I WOULD SAY THAT WE DO

01:55:09.135 --> 01:55:11.971
NEED TO CREATE THE SPACE FOR-

01:55:12.038 --> 01:55:18.144
THE- EXAMINATION TO CONTINUE.

01:55:18.211 --> 01:55:20.046
BUT I. NECESSARILY AT THAT AT

01:55:20.113 --> 01:55:20.613
THIS POINT I'M- SAYING THAT

01:55:20.680 --> 01:55:21.814
THERE ARE OFTEN USES THAT

01:55:21.881 --> 01:55:23.316
SHOULD BE ALLOWED OR THAT COULD

01:55:23.383 --> 01:55:26.986
BE. THE HARMS TO A. B. C.

01:55:27.053 --> 01:55:29.022
MITIGATED OR ELIMINATED THREE

01:55:29.088 --> 01:55:30.590
REGULATIONS THAT THAT'S PART OF

01:55:30.657 --> 01:55:31.457
THE REASON THAT WE NEED TO

01:55:31.524 --> 01:55:34.060
PRESS PAUSE. AND LOOK AT THAT

01:55:34.127 --> 01:55:36.663
MORE THOROUGHLY WHILE NOT USING

01:55:36.729 --> 01:55:39.532
THE TECHNOLOGY IN THE MEANTIME.

01:55:39.599 --> 01:55:40.800
I IF I COULD JUST FOLLOW UP ON

01:55:40.867 --> 01:55:42.235
THAT A LITTLE BIT- AND THEN I

01:55:42.302 --> 01:55:44.871
HAVE ANOTHER FOLLOW UP QUESTION

01:55:44.937 --> 01:55:48.074
TO. WHAT FOR WHAT YOU KNOW- FOR

01:55:48.141 --> 01:55:49.776
PURPOSES OF DISCUSSION JUST TO

01:55:49.842 --> 01:55:52.178
TODAY. ARE YOU'RE PROPOSING A

01:55:52.245 --> 01:55:54.213
KIND OF A MORATORIUM A COMPLETE

01:55:54.280 --> 01:55:55.281
BAN UNTIL YOU HIT YOU HIT THE

01:55:55.348 --> 01:55:56.949
PAUSE BUTTON. BUT AREN'T YOU

01:55:57.016 --> 01:55:59.552
ALSO- DISMISSING A LOT OF

01:55:59.619 --> 01:56:01.187
BENEFITS CREATED BY THE BY THE

01:56:01.254 --> 01:56:03.156
TECHNOLOGY ITSELF IN LIGHT OF.

01:56:03.222 --> 01:56:05.825
YOU KNOW THE- THINGS THAT IT'S

01:56:05.892 --> 01:56:08.895
BEING. YELP CREATED OR- THE

01:56:08.961 --> 01:56:10.863
FACT THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT IS

01:56:10.930 --> 01:56:12.298
USING THE TECHNOLOGY AND THAT'S

01:56:12.365 --> 01:56:13.733
A FIGHTING CRIME AND ALL THAT

01:56:13.800 --> 01:56:16.102
SO ARE YOU DISMISSING ALL THAT

01:56:16.169 --> 01:56:18.404
YOU KNOW AT THE SAME TIME- I

01:56:18.471 --> 01:56:19.972
MEAN I. IT BY HITTING THE PAUSE

01:56:20.039 --> 01:56:22.141
BUTTON ARE YOU SEE SOME SIMPLY

01:56:22.208 --> 01:56:23.109
SUGGESTING THAT WE SHOULDN'T

01:56:23.176 --> 01:56:26.012
USE THAT AT ALL WHATSOEVER- YOU

01:56:26.079 --> 01:56:27.046
KNOW YOU TO BUY A LAW

01:56:27.113 --> 01:56:29.148
ENFORCEMENT OR OTHERWISE. SO

01:56:29.215 --> 01:56:30.783
YOU CAN'T BUILD A FACIAL

01:56:30.850 --> 01:56:33.052
SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM INTENDED

01:56:33.119 --> 01:56:35.221
FOR CRIME FIGHTING WITHOUT ALSO

01:56:35.288 --> 01:56:37.090
CREATING ONE THEY CANBE IS TO

01:56:37.156 --> 01:56:40.026
STIFLE PROTESTS- ATTACK

01:56:40.093 --> 01:56:42.095
IMMIGRANTS MONITOR PEOPLE JUST

01:56:42.161 --> 01:56:43.129
GOING ABOUT THEIR DAILY LIVES

01:56:43.196 --> 01:56:46.165
THAT THEY COME. HAND IN HAND-

01:56:46.232 --> 01:56:48.534
BECAUSE IT'S THE TECHNOLOGY IN

01:56:48.601 --> 01:56:49.769
THE SYSTEM ITSELF THAT ALLOWS

01:56:49.836 --> 01:56:52.004
IT TO BE USED IN EITHER WAY AND

01:56:52.071 --> 01:56:54.173
SO ONCE THE SYSTEMS ARE BUILT

01:56:54.240 --> 01:56:56.609
THE HARM IS DONE AND SUPPORT.

01:56:56.676 --> 01:56:59.445
SERIOUS ABOUT SOLVING THE WORST

01:56:59.512 --> 01:57:01.748
CRIMES I WOULD SUGGEST THAT

01:57:01.814 --> 01:57:03.349
RATHER THAN ASKING LAW

01:57:03.416 --> 01:57:05.685
ENFORCEMENT TO HANDLE EDITION

01:57:05.752 --> 01:57:07.687
BUT ISSUES THAT WOULD BE BETTER

01:57:07.754 --> 01:57:09.021
ADDRESSED BY PUBLIC HEALTH

01:57:09.088 --> 01:57:10.690
INTERVENTIONS AND COMMUNITY

01:57:10.757 --> 01:57:13.126
PROGRAMS. SUCH AS STOPPING THE

01:57:13.192 --> 01:57:15.161
CRIMINALIZATION OF DRUG

01:57:15.228 --> 01:57:17.196
ADDICTION CRIMINALIZATION OF

01:57:17.263 --> 01:57:19.132
MENTAL ILLNESS AND POVERTY. AND

01:57:19.198 --> 01:57:21.100
MOVING IN SAID TOWARDS A

01:57:21.167 --> 01:57:23.136
CULTURE OF CARE THAT WOULD GO A

01:57:23.202 --> 01:57:24.704
LONG WAY TO MAKING SAFE

01:57:24.771 --> 01:57:26.205
COMMUNITY. WITHOUT INTRODUCING

01:57:26.272 --> 01:57:28.107
ALL OF VERY REAL HARMS THAT

01:57:28.174 --> 01:57:29.675
FEATURE RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY

01:57:29.742 --> 01:57:31.844
PRESENTS. ARE WHAT DO YOU THINK

01:57:31.911 --> 01:57:33.045
THE FOURTH AMENDMENT COME INTO

01:57:33.112 --> 01:57:36.883
PLAY IN THIS CONTACTS A- D. THE

01:57:36.949 --> 01:57:41.988
VIEW THAT THE USE OF- F. R. T.

01:57:42.054 --> 01:57:42.722
CONSTITUTE A SEARCH UNDER THE

01:57:42.789 --> 01:57:44.991
FOURTH AMENDMENT. OUR IN IT IT

01:57:45.057 --> 01:57:46.359
THE TO MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE

01:57:46.426 --> 01:57:50.430
BETWEEN ITS STATE IMAGES TAKEN

01:57:50.496 --> 01:57:51.998
OPENS THIS IS LOW. FIVE EIGHT I

01:57:52.064 --> 01:57:54.801
SET YOU KNOW SETTING OR EVEN SO.

01:57:54.867 --> 01:57:59.772
FOR THE PERRIN FOR INSTANCE.

01:57:59.839 --> 01:58:03.643
I'M SAY THAT ADAM CURRY CASE I

01:58:03.709 --> 01:58:05.511
WOULD INTO THAT THERE ARE DO IN

01:58:05.578 --> 01:58:06.479
YOUR OF PRIVACY UNDER THE

01:58:06.546 --> 01:58:08.147
FOURTH AMENDMENT DEPENDING ON

01:58:08.214 --> 01:58:10.082
WHERE THE PHOTO WAS TAKEN YES

01:58:10.149 --> 01:58:13.085
BUT I'M AS I'M WAS EARLIER SAID

01:58:13.152 --> 01:58:14.654
BEING OUT PUBLIC DOESN'T FULLY

01:58:14.720 --> 01:58:18.224
DIMINISH YOUR AN EXPECTATION OF

01:58:18.291 --> 01:58:21.661
PRIVACY SO FROM YOU KNOW THE

01:58:21.727 --> 01:58:23.429
WORK THAT I HAVE DONE ON THIS

01:58:23.496 --> 01:58:25.131
ISSUE THERE IS A FOURTH

01:58:25.198 --> 01:58:28.201
AMENDMENT- RIGHT AT PLAY THAT

01:58:28.267 --> 01:58:30.102
MIGHT HAVE TO DEPEND ON THE

01:58:30.169 --> 01:58:32.071
PARTICULAR CONTEXT IN WHICH

01:58:32.138 --> 01:58:33.206
FACIAL RECOGNITION IS BEING

01:58:33.272 --> 01:58:35.475
USED IN A PARTICULAR CASE IF

01:58:35.541 --> 01:58:38.010
THAT MAKES SENSE AS FAR AS

01:58:38.077 --> 01:58:38.644
WHERE THE PROBE PHOTO WAS TAKEN

01:58:38.711 --> 01:58:40.313
FROM. I'M AND I WOULD JUST ALSO

01:58:40.379 --> 01:58:42.248
ADD THAT FACIAL RECOGNITION

01:58:42.315 --> 01:58:43.883
WOULD CALL INTO QUESTION A

01:58:43.950 --> 01:58:46.419
PERSON'S RIGHT NOT TO IDENTIFY

01:58:46.486 --> 01:58:48.020
THEMSELVES TO LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:58:48.087 --> 01:58:50.656
THAT- WE HAVE THE RIGHT NOT TO

01:58:50.723 --> 01:58:52.492
SAY WHO WE ARE BUT IF LAW

01:58:52.558 --> 01:58:53.926
ENFORCEMENT CAN JUST SNAP A

01:58:53.993 --> 01:58:55.261
PHOTO OF US. RUN IT THROUGH A

01:58:55.328 --> 01:58:56.829
DATABASE AND COME UP WITH THAT

01:58:56.896 --> 01:58:58.498
ON OUR OWN THAT THAT WOULD

01:58:58.564 --> 01:59:00.900
IMPLICATE THAT RIGHT- AND THAT

01:59:00.967 --> 01:59:03.336
THAT SOMETHING THAT ALSO NEEDS

01:59:03.402 --> 01:59:04.170
TO BE LOOKED AT. YEAH I SEE.

01:59:04.237 --> 01:59:06.973
THE USE OF THE TECHNOLOGY IS-

01:59:07.039 --> 01:59:09.075
CONTINUING SO TO SPEAK- I

01:59:09.141 --> 01:59:11.611
THINK- YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY- ARE

01:59:11.677 --> 01:59:13.246
CURRENTLY. YOU KNOW THE

01:59:13.312 --> 01:59:14.647
TECHNOLOGY IS NOT REGULATED

01:59:14.714 --> 01:59:16.749
HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND ALL ON

01:59:16.816 --> 01:59:17.817
THE OTHER EXTREME OF THE

01:59:17.884 --> 01:59:20.219
CONTINUUM IS A COMPLETE. BAN OR

01:59:20.286 --> 01:59:22.221
A MORATORIUM FOR EXAMPLE. IN

01:59:22.288 --> 01:59:25.091
ALONG THE CONTINUUM DO YOU SEE

01:59:25.157 --> 01:59:27.460
VIEW SOME KIND OF A YOU KNOW A

01:59:27.527 --> 01:59:30.296
SPOT WHERE. IT IS MORE

01:59:30.363 --> 01:59:33.132
REASONABLE- TO BE ADDED FOR THE

01:59:33.199 --> 01:59:36.235
STATE OF FOR EXAMPLE I'M JUST

01:59:36.302 --> 01:59:37.370
THROWING THINGS OUT. WHETHER

01:59:37.436 --> 01:59:39.539
OBTAINING CONSENT OR NOTICE AND

01:59:39.605 --> 01:59:42.174
OR NOTICE- TO THE PERSONS WHOSE

01:59:42.241 --> 01:59:44.577
IMAGES BEING. CAPTURE WOULD DOT

01:59:44.644 --> 01:59:46.479
ALSO ALLEVIATE SOME OF THE

01:59:46.546 --> 01:59:49.615
CONCERNS. ALONG THAT CONTINUUM

01:59:49.682 --> 01:59:50.983
FOR EXAMPLE AND THAT'S AN

01:59:51.050 --> 01:59:53.519
EXCELLENT QUESTION AND ONE THAT

01:59:53.586 --> 01:59:55.021
I THINK WOULD BE WONDERFUL TO.

01:59:55.087 --> 01:59:56.756
PONDER AND DISCUSS WHILE WE

01:59:56.822 --> 01:59:58.190
HAVE A MORATORIUM IN PLACE TO

01:59:58.257 --> 01:59:59.859
PUT A PAUSE ON THE USE OF

01:59:59.926 --> 02:00:01.193
FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY

02:00:01.260 --> 02:00:04.263
UNTIL WE HAVE AN ANSWER- AS A

02:00:04.330 --> 02:00:06.232
CALIFORNIA ON AND JUST TO

02:00:06.299 --> 02:00:08.234
FOLLOW UP WHO WHO. WHO IS A

02:00:08.301 --> 02:00:10.202
DINO WHO IS CONDUCTING ON THE

02:00:10.269 --> 02:00:12.138
STATE EASE WHILE WE HIT THE

02:00:12.204 --> 02:00:15.107
PAUSE BUTTON. ON TO SOME EXTENT

02:00:15.174 --> 02:00:16.342
THAT DEPENDS ON WHETHER THE

02:00:16.409 --> 02:00:18.444
LEGISLATURE DECIDES TO ASK

02:00:18.511 --> 02:00:21.781
SOMEONE TO- I KNOW THAT THIS IS

02:00:21.847 --> 02:00:23.950
NOT AT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT

02:00:24.016 --> 02:00:26.085
IS BEING DISCUSSED IN CIVIL

02:00:26.152 --> 02:00:27.286
RIGHTS AND CIVIL LIBERTY

02:00:27.353 --> 02:00:29.221

02:00:29.288 --> 02:00:31.824
THERE ARE ANY POTENTIAL

02:00:31.891 --> 02:00:33.459
POSITIVE USES OR WHETHER THE

02:00:33.526 --> 02:00:35.528
HARMS REALLY DO OUTWEIGH. ANY

02:00:35.595 --> 02:00:38.831
BENEFITS- AND AS OF RIGHT NOW-

02:00:38.898 --> 02:00:41.567

OTHERS HERE SAID THAT THE RIGHT

02:00:51.844 --> 02:00:54.113
THING TO DO IS TO EITHER HIT

02:00:54.180 --> 02:00:55.448
POTS WITH A MORATORIUM OR DO AN

02:00:55.514 --> 02:00:57.450
OUTRIGHT BAN THAT THAT IS WHERE

02:00:57.516 --> 02:01:00.052
THEY SEE IT THE- APPROPRIATE

02:01:00.119 --> 02:01:01.187
BALANCE. YOUR IMAGE IF THERE

02:01:01.253 --> 02:01:03.089

ROOM ACTUALLY OF THE YEAR THERE

SOME PEOPLE BELIEVE THE

02:02:35.715 --> 02:02:36.816
TECHNOLOGY SHOULD BE BANNED OUT

02:02:36.882 --> 02:02:38.951
RIGHT MAYBE SOME PEOPLE FROM

BUT I IMAGINE MOST OF US FALL

02:02:43.422 --> 02:02:44.957
SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS

02:02:45.024 --> 02:02:47.993
QUESTION- MOST OF US ALL OF US

02:02:48.060 --> 02:02:49.528
I WOULD SAY ONE AT THE CAPITOL

02:02:49.595 --> 02:02:50.329
BECAUSE THAT SHOOTER TO BE

02:02:50.396 --> 02:02:52.131
FOUND AND OFFICIAL RECOGNITION

02:02:52.198 --> 02:02:54.633
CAN DO THAT- ALL THE BETTER. AT

02:02:54.700 --> 02:02:56.235

02:02:56.302 --> 02:02:58.304
CONCEDE THAT POINT WHILE ALSO

02:02:58.370 --> 02:02:59.538
BEING DEEPLY TROUBLED BY THE

02:02:59.605 --> 02:03:01.640
USE OF THIS TECHNOLOGY- AND I'D

02:03:01.707 --> 02:03:03.943
LIKE TO SPEND MY TIME- TALKING

02:03:04.009 --> 02:03:05.377

CIVIL LIBERTIES CONSEQUENCES OF

02:03:06.946 --> 02:03:08.314
DEPLOYMENT OF FACIAL

02:03:08.380 --> 02:03:09.782
RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY BY LAW

02:03:09.849 --> 02:03:11.684
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES PRETTY IT

02:03:11.751 --> 02:03:15.087
IMPACT ON THE- BEING IN PUBLIC.

02:03:15.154 --> 02:03:17.256
AND THOUGH I WILL DO THAT IN

02:03:17.323 --> 02:03:18.224
REFERENCE TO THE FIRST AMEND

02:03:18.290 --> 02:03:20.025
RIGHT AT TWO ASSEMBLY AND THE

02:03:20.092 --> 02:03:21.460
FOURTH AMENDMENT RIGHT TO

02:03:25.397 --> 02:03:27.099
CONSTITUTION MAY. OR WHAT THE

02:03:27.166 --> 02:03:30.669
PROTECT OUR UP THAT SAID THE

02:03:30.736 --> 02:03:33.339
CEILING AND THIS BY HAS NO ROLE

02:03:33.405 --> 02:03:34.206
TO DETERMINING THE RULES OF THE

02:03:34.273 --> 02:03:39.645
ROAD FOR USING THIS TECHNOLOGY-

02:03:39.712 --> 02:03:40.946
SO. ONE OF REASONS WE'VE BEEN

02:03:41.013 --> 02:03:41.981
DISCUSSED TO IS WHAT IS A- DE

02:03:42.047 --> 02:03:42.982
ABOUT THE USE OF FACIAL.

02:03:43.048 --> 02:03:44.350
TECHNOLOGY I THINK MEMBER

02:03:44.416 --> 02:03:46.085
OBERNOLTE WAS AT TALKING ABOUT

02:03:46.152 --> 02:03:49.355
THAT- AND- EIGHT IT IS JUST A

02:03:49.421 --> 02:03:51.924
VAST EXPANSION OF THE ABILITY

02:03:51.991 --> 02:03:53.292
TO IDENTIFY PEOPLE WHEN THEY

02:03:53.359 --> 02:03:55.594
ARE OUT IN PUBLIC. IT IS A HUGE

02:03:55.661 --> 02:03:57.763
CHANGE IT IS TRUE THAT THERE

02:03:57.830 --> 02:03:59.632
HAVE BEEN VIDEO. SURVEILLANCE

02:03:59.698 --> 02:04:01.834
CAMERAS IN PUBLIC PLACES FOR A

02:04:01.901 --> 02:04:03.969
LONG TIME. BUT IN GENERAL NO

02:04:04.036 --> 02:04:05.070
ONE LOOKED AT THE FOOTAGE RIGHT

02:04:05.137 --> 02:04:06.105
YOU MIGHT LOOK AT THE FOOTAGE

02:04:06.172 --> 02:04:07.873
IF FOR EXAMPLE A CRIME

02:04:07.940 --> 02:04:10.309
OCCURRED- AND YOU'RE TRYING TO

02:04:10.376 --> 02:04:13.078
IDENTIFY SOMEONE- BUT THERE WAS

02:04:13.145 --> 02:04:14.480
NO PERSISTENT PERPETUAL

02:04:14.547 --> 02:04:17.683
REVIEWING OF THE FOOTAGE. AND

02:04:17.750 --> 02:04:19.852
IN LOOKING AT THE FOOTAGE

02:04:19.919 --> 02:04:20.953
REQUIRED SOME EFFORT SOME

02:04:21.020 --> 02:04:21.887
PEOPLE ARE FOR THIS HOSPITAL

02:04:21.954 --> 02:04:23.255
REQUIRES TIME IT REQUIRES

02:04:23.322 --> 02:04:24.156
COMMITMENT A LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:04:24.223 --> 02:04:27.259
RESOURCES. AND FACIAL

02:04:27.326 --> 02:04:28.994
RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY COUPLED

02:04:29.061 --> 02:04:30.963
WITH ALGORITHM ALGORITHMS THAT

02:04:31.030 --> 02:04:32.565
CAN ANALYZE FOOTAGE RAISE THE

02:04:32.631 --> 02:04:34.233
PROSPECT OF BEING ABLE TO

02:04:34.300 --> 02:04:35.267
IDENTIFY PEOPLE ON A FAIRLY

02:04:35.334 --> 02:04:37.136
PERSISTENT BASIS IN PUBLIC

02:04:37.203 --> 02:04:39.371
PLACES. AND FOR A PRACTICAL

02:04:39.438 --> 02:04:42.074
MATTER THAT IS A RADICAL CHANGE

02:04:42.141 --> 02:04:44.210
TO HOW WE ARE IN PUBLIC- IS THE

02:04:44.276 --> 02:04:47.880
ESSENTIAL EXAMPLE COMES FROM

02:04:47.947 --> 02:04:49.882
THE FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHT. WE

02:04:49.949 --> 02:04:50.449
HAVE A PERSON MEANT. I JUST

02:04:50.516 --> 02:04:53.786
READ OF SPEED BUT ALSO TO SOME.

02:04:53.853 --> 02:04:55.888
IN THE- AND- IN COURT HAS ROAD.

02:04:55.955 --> 02:04:56.822
THAT AND THE RIGHT TO ACCESS

02:04:56.889 --> 02:04:58.657
THESE RIGHTS ANONYMOUSLY. THE

02:04:58.724 --> 02:05:00.659
QUINTESSENTIAL CASE IS THE NWC

02:05:00.726 --> 02:05:03.596
TV ALABAMA CASE IN WHICH- THE

02:05:03.662 --> 02:05:05.231
STATE OF ALABAMA ATTEMPTED TO

02:05:05.297 --> 02:05:07.066
REQUIRE THE AND DOUBLE ACP TO

02:05:07.132 --> 02:05:08.834
DISCLOSE ITS MEMBERSHIP. THIS

02:05:08.901 --> 02:05:10.135
CASE DATED FROM THE NINETEEN

02:05:10.202 --> 02:05:11.770
FIFTIES ANYONE WHO KNOWS

02:05:11.837 --> 02:05:12.938
ANYTHING AT ALL ABOUT AMERICAN

02:05:13.005 --> 02:05:14.773
HISTORY UNDERSTANDS THAT YOU A

02:05:14.840 --> 02:05:16.442
DATE THE TO IDENTIFY YOURSELF

02:05:16.508 --> 02:05:18.410
AS AN AND DOUBLE ACP. MEMBER IN

02:05:18.477 --> 02:05:20.646
ALABAMA NINETEEN FIFTY WOULD BE

02:05:20.713 --> 02:05:22.348
UNLIKELY TO JOIN AND THE

02:05:22.414 --> 02:05:23.782
SUPREME COURT SAID THAT THE

02:05:23.849 --> 02:05:25.384
FIRST AMENDMENT ENCOMPASSES THE

02:05:25.451 --> 02:05:27.586
RIGHT. NOT JUST TO- EXERCISE

02:05:27.653 --> 02:05:30.089
YOUR FREEDOMS BUT TO DO SO FREE

02:05:30.155 --> 02:05:32.491
FROM HAVING TO DO SO PUBLICLY

02:05:32.558 --> 02:05:34.059
AND THAT'S EXTENDED TO PUBLIC

02:05:34.126 --> 02:05:35.694
PROTESTS AND IT IS SURE IT IS

02:05:35.761 --> 02:05:37.830
TRUE TO BE SURE. THAT WHEN

02:05:37.897 --> 02:05:39.131
YOU'RE OUT IN PUBLIC YOU MIGHT

02:05:39.198 --> 02:05:40.966
BE INCIDENTALLY IDENTIFIED

02:05:41.033 --> 02:05:42.334
RIGHT YOU COULD RUN INTO A

02:05:42.401 --> 02:05:43.636
FRIEND YOU COULD RUN INTO A

02:05:43.702 --> 02:05:44.970
NEIGHBOR YOU COULD DRAW THE

02:05:45.037 --> 02:05:46.338
ATTENTION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:05:46.405 --> 02:05:48.173
AGENCIES SOME HOW BUT IT IS

02:05:48.240 --> 02:05:50.409
FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT- I WAS

02:05:50.476 --> 02:05:52.411
REALLY STRUCK BY- THE FIRST

02:05:52.478 --> 02:05:53.846
PRESENTER SLIDER HE SHOULD AN

02:05:53.913 --> 02:05:55.514
IMAGE OF A CROWD. WITH A LITTLE

02:05:55.581 --> 02:05:57.082
YELLOW BOX AROUND EVERY FACE

02:05:57.149 --> 02:05:59.518
RIGHT THAT AND WHEN ULTIMATELY

02:05:59.585 --> 02:06:01.053
BEING ABLE TO NOT JUST

02:06:01.120 --> 02:06:02.721
RECOGNIZE THOSE FACES WHICH IS

02:06:02.788 --> 02:06:04.089
WHAT THAT SLIDE WAS ABOUT BUT

02:06:04.156 --> 02:06:05.724
ULTIMATELY TO IDENTIFY THOSE

02:06:05.791 --> 02:06:06.759
PEOPLE. AT SCALE IT

02:06:06.825 --> 02:06:08.460
FUNDAMENTALLY. AND THE MOST

02:06:08.527 --> 02:06:10.195
STRIKING EXAMPLE OF ALL OF THIS

02:06:10.262 --> 02:06:12.331
WAS NOT A U. S. BASED EXAMPLE

02:06:12.398 --> 02:06:13.866
BUT A HONG KONG BASED EXAMPLE

02:06:13.933 --> 02:06:15.000
WHEN WE ARE WATCHING PROTESTERS

02:06:15.067 --> 02:06:17.303
IN MASKS- GOING OUT TO PROTEST.

02:06:17.369 --> 02:06:19.905
BECAUSE OF THEIR DESIRE TO

02:06:19.972 --> 02:06:21.941
EXPRESS THEMSELVES BUT FEAR OF

02:06:22.007 --> 02:06:23.208
THE CONSEQUENCES AND YOU CAN

02:06:23.275 --> 02:06:25.678
SEE WHAT IS LOST AT POTENTIALLY

02:06:25.744 --> 02:06:27.079
FROM THE PUBLIC SQUARE IF

02:06:27.146 --> 02:06:29.415
PEOPLE- IT CAN'T GO OUT AND

02:06:29.481 --> 02:06:30.749
PROTEST WITHOUT THINKING THAT

02:06:30.816 --> 02:06:32.384
THEIR EVERY MOVEMENT IS. AT

02:06:32.451 --> 02:06:34.053
EVERY IMAGE IS GOING TO BE

02:06:34.119 --> 02:06:36.822
TRACKED- SO. THOSE ARE SOME OF

02:06:36.889 --> 02:06:38.090
THE FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS

02:06:38.157 --> 02:06:38.958
ANOTHER QUESTION THAT WE'VE

02:06:39.024 --> 02:06:41.860
BEEN TALKING ABOUT IS WHERE TO

02:06:41.927 --> 02:06:42.928
THE FOURTH AMENDMENT RIGHT TO

02:06:42.995 --> 02:06:45.497
PRIVACY COME IN. IF THERE IS A

02:06:45.564 --> 02:06:47.566
TO BE FREE FROM UNREASONABLE

02:06:47.633 --> 02:06:51.303
SEARCHES AND SEIZURES. AND IT

02:06:51.370 --> 02:06:55.374
TO THE MATTER. WE DON'T KNOW

02:06:55.441 --> 02:06:56.675
HOW THAT PLAY PATIENT.

02:06:56.742 --> 02:06:58.944
TECHNOLOGY ON THE HAND PEOPLE'S.

02:06:59.011 --> 02:07:00.346
SAID TO HAVE A RIGHT TO HAVE A

02:07:00.412 --> 02:07:00.980
SEAT IN THERE FOR. PARTICULARLY

02:07:01.046 --> 02:07:01.981
PUBLIC. A THE OTHER HAND IN A

02:07:02.047 --> 02:07:04.283
SERIES RECENT CASES THE U. S.

02:07:04.350 --> 02:07:05.084
SUPREME COURT HAS BEEN

02:07:05.150 --> 02:07:07.386
GRAPPLING WITH THE QUESTION. OF

02:07:07.453 --> 02:07:08.988
TO WHAT EXTENT ARE DIGITAL

02:07:09.054 --> 02:07:10.089
TECHNOLOGIES DIFFERENT FROM

02:07:10.155 --> 02:07:12.424
ANALOG TECHNOLOGIES UP SO FOR

02:07:12.491 --> 02:07:15.728
EXAMPLE. IT IS OFTEN CNCLUDED-

02:07:15.794 --> 02:07:16.895
THAT THERE ARE MEANINGFUL

02:07:16.962 --> 02:07:19.064
DIFFERENCES- IN A RECENT CASE

02:07:19.131 --> 02:07:21.266
FOR EXAMPLE- THE SUPREME COURT

02:07:21.333 --> 02:07:22.634
CONCLUDED THAT THE GOVERNMENT

02:07:22.701 --> 02:07:23.702
NEEDED A WARRANT BASED ON

02:07:23.769 --> 02:07:26.872
PROBABLE CAUSE. TO OBTAIN-

02:07:26.939 --> 02:07:29.375
I'LL- SELL SITE LOCATION AT IS

02:07:29.441 --> 02:07:31.877
IT PROBABLE CAUSE TO SEARCH THE

02:07:31.944 --> 02:07:32.878
CONTENT OF AN ARRESTED PERSON

02:07:32.945 --> 02:07:34.880
CELL PHONE. NOW THOSE OF YOU

02:07:34.947 --> 02:07:36.749
WHO ARE LAWYERS KNOW THAT

02:07:36.815 --> 02:07:38.150
SEARCHING SOMEONE'S POCKETS

02:07:38.217 --> 02:07:39.485
RIGHT IT'S SOMETHING YOU COULD

02:07:39.551 --> 02:07:41.053
SIMPLY DO INCIDENT TO ARREST

02:07:41.120 --> 02:07:42.521
WITH NO WARRANT WHATSOEVER JUST

02:07:42.588 --> 02:07:43.055
BECAUSE SOMEONE HAS BEEN

02:07:43.122 --> 02:07:44.723
ARRESTED. BUT THE SUPREME COURT

02:07:44.790 --> 02:07:47.026
DECLINES TO EXTEND THAT TO

02:07:47.092 --> 02:07:48.060
ALLOWING LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:07:48.127 --> 02:07:49.361
AGENCIES TO SEARCH A CELL

02:07:49.428 --> 02:07:51.230
PHONE. AND IT DID SO BECAUSE IT

02:07:51.296 --> 02:07:53.165
THOUGHT. THAT SAYING THAT

02:07:53.232 --> 02:07:55.334
SEARCHING POCKETS COMPARED TO

02:07:55.401 --> 02:07:56.602
SEARCHING A CELL PHONE WAS LIKE

02:07:56.668 --> 02:07:58.504
SAYING A RIDE ON HORSEBACK IS

02:07:58.570 --> 02:08:00.639
IN DISTINGUISHES MATERIALLY

02:08:00.706 --> 02:08:02.074
INDISTINGUISHABLE. FROM A

02:08:02.141 --> 02:08:03.609
FLIGHT TO THE MOON RIGHT

02:08:03.675 --> 02:08:04.610
THERE'S REALLY NO DIFFERENCE

02:08:04.676 --> 02:08:06.512
AND THERE'S A VAST DIFFERENCE

02:08:06.578 --> 02:08:08.847
IN TERMS OF PRIVACY INVASION.

02:08:08.914 --> 02:08:10.015
OF GOING THROUGH SOMEONE'S

02:08:10.082 --> 02:08:11.617
POCKETS AND GO THROUGH THE BILL

02:08:11.683 --> 02:08:19.792
DECK. OF AND- SOMEONE ELSE

02:08:19.858 --> 02:08:24.129
PREVIEW. SEC FOLLOWING SOMEONE

02:08:24.196 --> 02:08:25.664
THAT MAY NOT IMPLICATE A FOURTH

02:08:25.731 --> 02:08:26.665
AMENDMENT RIGHT READY

02:08:26.732 --> 02:08:28.467
PHYSICALLY FOLLOW SOMEONE AND

02:08:28.534 --> 02:08:31.537
SOME ARGUED THAT WHY THEN CAN'T

02:08:31.603 --> 02:08:33.238
YOU SIMPLY OBTAIN SOMEONE'S

02:08:33.305 --> 02:08:36.041
HISTORICAL CELL PHONE LOCATION

02:08:36.108 --> 02:08:38.710
HERDS. AS WELL RIGHT THAT IS

02:08:38.777 --> 02:08:40.112
ALSO- TRACKING EOPLE WHERE

02:08:40.179 --> 02:08:42.414
THEY MOVE UP BUT THE SUPREME

02:08:42.481 --> 02:08:43.982
COURT HAS SAID THAT THAT

02:08:44.049 --> 02:08:45.717
ACTUALLY DOES REQUIRE OF FOURTH

02:08:45.784 --> 02:08:47.753
AMENDMENT WARRANT- AND IT IS

02:08:47.820 --> 02:08:49.254
BECAUSE OF THE DIGITAL NATURE

02:08:49.321 --> 02:08:52.224
OF THE DATA- BECAUSE THE COURT

02:08:52.291 --> 02:08:53.992
SAID THAT THE TIME STAMP DATA

02:08:54.059 --> 02:08:55.894
PROVIDED INTIMATE WINDOW INTO A

02:08:55.961 --> 02:08:57.229
PERSON'S PERSONAL LIFE.

02:08:57.296 --> 02:08:58.197
REVEALING NOT ONLY HIS

02:08:58.263 --> 02:08:59.798

ASSOCIATIONS RIGHT THERE WHEN

02:09:05.537 --> 02:09:06.738
YOU START TO BE ABLE TO TRACK

02:09:10.676 --> 02:09:12.211
ARE SIMPLY YOU KNOW A MOONS

02:09:12.277 --> 02:09:14.113
LINK AWAY FROM OUR PREVIOUS

02:09:14.179 --> 02:09:16.148
ANALOG WORLD IN WHICH YOU MIGHT

02:09:16.215 --> 02:09:19.852
HAVE- INDIVIDUALS- LOOKING AT

ONE- ONE AT TANK DONE IF I. AN

02:09:25.924 --> 02:09:26.959
SO GUTEN BEFORE. OF THE

02:09:30.262 --> 02:09:31.230
AND THE FACT THAT THEIR

CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS ISSUE

02:09:32.264 --> 02:09:34.933
PLAYS. AT PLAY DOES NOT MEAN

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:36.568
THAT THIS BODY SIMPLY WAIT FOR

02:09:36.635 --> 02:09:40.572
COURTS TO RESOLVE THIS- THAT

02:09:40.639 --> 02:09:41.306
TENDS TO TAKE A LONG TIME IT

02:09:41.373 --> 02:09:44.576
TOOK THE COURT UNTIL- THE-

02:09:44.643 --> 02:09:45.110
TWENTY TEN FOR EXAMPLE TO

02:09:45.177 --> 02:09:47.946
DECIDE THAT A CELL PHONE-

02:09:48.013 --> 02:09:49.047
RESEARCH TRIGGERS THE FOURTH

02:09:49.114 --> 02:09:50.482
AMENDMENT WE DON'T WANNA RATE

02:09:50.549 --> 02:09:51.183
AROUND FOR SIMILAR PERIODS OF.

02:09:51.250 --> 02:09:53.051
TIME AND ALSO THE SUPREME COURT

02:09:53.118 --> 02:09:54.486
HAS BEEN SEPARATELY SIGNALING

02:09:54.553 --> 02:09:56.188
THAT IT WOULD VASTLY PREFER IT

02:09:56.255 --> 02:09:58.724
LEGISLATORS RATHER THAN- THE

02:09:58.790 --> 02:10:00.859
SUPREME COURT DECIDE THESE

02:10:00.926 --> 02:10:02.327
TECHNOLOGY ISSUES AS- JUSTICE

02:10:02.394 --> 02:10:04.429
LEADER REMARKED IN AN OPINION A

02:10:04.496 --> 02:10:06.965
LEGISLATIVE BODY IS WELL SUITED

02:10:07.032 --> 02:10:08.267
TO GAME. CHANGING PUBLIC

02:10:08.333 --> 02:10:10.702
ATTITUDES TO DROP DETAILED

02:10:10.769 --> 02:10:11.403
LINES AND TO BALANCE PRICE AND

02:10:11.470 --> 02:10:13.472
HOW SAFETY IN A COMPREHENSIVE

02:10:13.539 --> 02:10:16.575
WAY AND THAT IS OF COURSE OR

02:10:16.642 --> 02:10:17.609
JOB HERE. THE ONE THING I THINK

02:10:17.676 --> 02:10:19.311
YOU SO I TALK A LITTLE BIT

02:10:19.378 --> 02:10:20.045
ABOUT WHAT I THINK YOU SHOULD.

02:10:20.112 --> 02:10:22.481
YOU AB WHICH FEELS I'M SURE

02:10:22.548 --> 02:10:24.650
INVITE ME JUST THAT SO HERE I

02:10:24.716 --> 02:10:26.818
AM THE ONE THING I. SHOULD NOT

02:10:26.885 --> 02:10:28.754
IS TO. IS UNIQUE IN THAT IN THE

02:10:28.820 --> 02:10:31.690
DAYS BE PERMITTED THIS REGULATE

02:10:31.757 --> 02:10:34.626
WE HAVE TREMENDOUS I'M OF

02:10:34.693 --> 02:10:42.234
RESEARCH. FOR BUT POLICE. WELL

02:10:42.301 --> 02:10:44.036
PLACE TO MAKE VALUES TRADE OFFS

02:10:44.102 --> 02:10:45.971
AND IT IS YOUR JOB TO DECIDE

02:10:46.038 --> 02:10:47.839
HOW TO VALUE PUBLIC SAFETY

02:10:47.906 --> 02:10:49.408
VERSUS PRIVACY VERSUS FREE

02:10:49.474 --> 02:10:50.509
SPEECH AND WHERE THOSE LINE

02:10:50.576 --> 02:10:52.911
SHOULD BE DRAWN- SO WHEN IT

02:10:52.978 --> 02:10:55.214
COMES TO- REGULATION A FACIAL

02:10:55.280 --> 02:10:56.548
RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY I THINK

02:10:56.615 --> 02:10:57.382
REASONABLE MINDS CAN DIFFER

02:10:57.449 --> 02:11:00.352
ABOUT WHAT WE DO- AND- BY THE

02:11:00.419 --> 02:11:02.120
WAY. ALTHOUGH A MORATORIUM

02:11:02.187 --> 02:11:04.623
SOUNDS EXTREME IF YOU'RE NOT

02:11:04.690 --> 02:11:06.458
GOING TO ACT IN MORATORIUM HAD

02:11:06.525 --> 02:11:07.426
TO ACTUALLY PUT IN DETAILED

02:11:07.492 --> 02:11:09.294
REGULATIONS A MORATORIUM ME

02:11:09.361 --> 02:11:10.963
SOUNDS LIKE A VERY GOOD IDEA.

02:11:11.029 --> 02:11:13.031
AND THAT'S BECAUSE THERE IS NO

02:11:13.098 --> 02:11:15.500
STAYING STILL THIS DEBATE. IF

02:11:15.567 --> 02:11:16.702
YOU DO NOTHING THIS TECHNOLOGY

02:11:16.768 --> 02:11:19.938
IS SIMPLY GOING TO BECOME MORE

02:11:20.005 --> 02:11:20.572
ENTRENCHED AND THEN IT IS GOING

02:11:20.639 --> 02:11:22.641
TO BE EVER HARDER FOR YOU TO

02:11:22.708 --> 02:11:23.408
REGULATE. BECAUSE LAW ENFORCER

02:11:23.475 --> 02:11:27.579
THAT. LOT ON THIS TECH. IT THE

02:11:27.646 --> 02:11:29.348
ARE YOU CAN THEN CUT AND

02:11:29.414 --> 02:11:31.550
REGULATE IS WILL APPEAR EVEN.

02:11:31.617 --> 02:11:33.885
RESTIVE SO. YOU MAY BE WILL

02:11:33.952 --> 02:11:35.187
POSE NOW TO MAKE IT OFFICIAL

02:11:35.254 --> 02:11:37.556
CONNECTION DATE BUT IF YOU SIDE

02:11:37.623 --> 02:11:39.324
THAT FURTHER TIME IN EVOLUTION

02:11:39.391 --> 02:11:42.894
OF TECHNOLOGY IS. A REQUIRED

02:11:42.961 --> 02:11:44.429
THAT AT LEAST ONE LAW

02:11:44.496 --> 02:11:46.298
ENFORCEMENT USES AND SO IT

02:11:46.365 --> 02:11:47.733
WOULD BE BETTER PUT MORE

02:11:47.799 --> 02:11:50.135
INTERNET PLACE OR MAINLY THE

02:11:50.202 --> 02:11:57.643
WINDOW AND HIGHLY. THERE IS A-

02:11:57.709 --> 02:11:59.211
AND IS POTENTIAL AND THAT IS

02:11:59.278 --> 02:12:00.078
WHEN IT TO THE PERVASIVE USE

02:12:00.145 --> 02:12:01.213
RECOGNITION TO IN PUBLIC PLACES

02:12:01.280 --> 02:12:02.814
IT MAY BE THE AMERICANS ARE

02:12:02.881 --> 02:12:04.650
PREPARE TO KNOW THAT EVERY TIME

02:12:04.716 --> 02:12:05.717
THEY STEP OUT OF DOORS- THEY

02:12:05.784 --> 02:12:09.221
COULD POTENTIALLY BE- MONITORED

02:12:09.288 --> 02:12:11.490
WITHOUT SUSPICION- TO LOOK AT

02:12:11.556 --> 02:12:13.058
PEOPLE'S FACES TO ENGAGE IN

02:12:13.125 --> 02:12:15.594
SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY CORRELATION

02:12:15.661 --> 02:12:16.128
THAT AND IF THINGS. AREN'T

02:12:16.194 --> 02:12:18.030
QUESTION REALLY A YOU KNOW AND

02:12:18.096 --> 02:12:19.598
THAT'S A WITH RELATIVELY EASY

02:12:19.665 --> 02:12:21.633
TO WRITE TO REGULATE RIGHT NOW

02:12:21.700 --> 02:12:23.101
BECAUSE IT'S NOT HAPPENING.

02:12:23.168 --> 02:12:24.136
THAT'S RIGHT IT MAY BE THE

02:12:24.202 --> 02:12:25.871
FUTURE BUT IT IS NOT THE

02:12:25.937 --> 02:12:26.505
PRESENT AND THEREFORE YOU DON'T

02:12:26.571 --> 02:12:27.372
HAVE TO OPPOSE ANYONE'S

02:12:27.439 --> 02:12:30.242
ENTRENCHED PROGRAM. I THINK THE

02:12:30.309 --> 02:12:32.611
REAL QUESTION COMES- BUT WHEN

02:12:32.678 --> 02:12:34.479
YOU LOOK AT NEVER USES WHEN LAW

02:12:34.546 --> 02:12:35.781
ENFORCEMENT SUSPECTS A

02:12:35.847 --> 02:12:37.282
PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL WHO'S

02:12:37.349 --> 02:12:39.885
BEEN CAUGHT ON VIDEOTAPE- HAS

02:12:39.951 --> 02:12:42.321
BEEN- IT IS HAS BEEN SHOWN

02:12:42.387 --> 02:12:43.822
ENGAGING IN A CRIME AND THEY

02:12:43.889 --> 02:12:45.824
IDENTIFY THAT. AND THAT'S

02:12:45.891 --> 02:12:47.492
LEGITIMATE USE THIS TECHNOLOGY

02:12:47.559 --> 02:12:48.960
IN MY VIEW BUT IT SHOULD BE

02:12:49.027 --> 02:12:52.164
REGULATED- AND- SOME OF MY

02:12:52.230 --> 02:12:53.965
FELLOW LAW PROFESSORS FRIEDMAN

02:12:54.032 --> 02:12:55.534
AND ANDREW. HAVE MADE A

02:12:55.600 --> 02:12:56.702
PROPOSAL THIS IS I THINK IS

02:12:56.768 --> 02:12:58.537
REALLY QUITE REASONABLE FIRST

02:12:58.603 --> 02:12:59.037
OF ALL THEY THINK THIS

02:12:59.104 --> 02:13:00.672
TECHNOLOGY SHOULD BE USED UNTIL

02:13:00.739 --> 02:13:02.607
ISSUES A BIASED CAN BE WORKED

02:13:02.674 --> 02:13:05.877
OUT THEY'RE NOT ISSUES A BIAS

02:13:05.944 --> 02:13:08.046
ALREADY COUSIN IN POLICING. WE

02:13:08.113 --> 02:13:08.647
DON'T WANT TO MAKE THINGS WORK

02:13:08.714 --> 02:13:13.618
BUT THAT HARD. LAN FOR TO BE A-

02:13:13.685 --> 02:13:14.252
TO. THEY WANT TO USE THE SECOND

02:13:14.319 --> 02:13:15.420
IT'S NOT BANNED BUT YOU DO HAVE

02:13:15.487 --> 02:13:17.456
TO GO TO JUDGE SO YOU HAVE A

02:13:17.522 --> 02:13:18.890
PROBABLE CAUSE TO BELIEVE THAT

02:13:18.957 --> 02:13:19.925
SOMEONE IS ENGAGED IN

02:13:19.991 --> 02:13:21.360
WRONGDOING AND THAT USING THIS

02:13:21.426 --> 02:13:22.961
PARTICULAR TECHNOLOGY WILL HELP

02:13:23.028 --> 02:13:24.062
IDENTIFY SOMEONE HAS COMMITTED

02:13:24.129 --> 02:13:28.100
A CRIME. A THIRD. THERE SHOULD

02:13:28.166 --> 02:13:32.337
BE AS OTHERS HAVE SAID- OF.

02:13:32.404 --> 02:13:34.873
REQUIRED THAT IT THAT THE CRIME

02:13:34.940 --> 02:13:36.708
AT ISSUE BE A SERIOUS ONE THIS

02:13:36.775 --> 02:13:37.776
IS EXACTLY WHAT THE FEDERAL

02:13:37.843 --> 02:13:39.711
GOVERNMENT DID WHEN IT FIRST

02:13:39.778 --> 02:13:41.847
IMPLEMENTED WIRE TAPS- IT

02:13:41.913 --> 02:13:43.014
PASSED TITLE THREE OF THE WIRE

02:13:43.081 --> 02:13:44.282
TAP LAW SAYING THAT YOU CAN

02:13:44.349 --> 02:13:45.450
ENGAGE IN. WIRE TAPS BUT

02:13:45.517 --> 02:13:47.085
BECAUSE IS THE PRIVACY INVASIVE

02:13:47.152 --> 02:13:48.820
TECHNOLOGY YOU CAN ONLY DO SO

02:13:48.887 --> 02:13:50.722
FOR THE NUMERATOR LIST OF

02:13:50.789 --> 02:13:51.289
CRIMES THAT ARE PARTICULARLY

02:13:51.356 --> 02:13:53.792
SERIOUS. ON AND FIND. OF IT AND

02:13:53.859 --> 02:13:56.561
I THINK HERE I IN THE POLICE

02:13:56.628 --> 02:13:58.430
UNION A THREE- THERE SHOULD BE

02:13:58.497 --> 02:14:01.166
REALLY EXTENSIVE TRANSPARENCY

02:14:01.233 --> 02:14:03.101
AND ACCOUNTABILITY OR FIREMEN

02:14:03.168 --> 02:14:04.002
SO THERE SHOULD BE PUBLIC

02:14:04.069 --> 02:14:05.604
POLICIES WHAT THEY USE THEY

02:14:05.670 --> 02:14:06.271
SHOULD OUTLINED THE

02:14:06.338 --> 02:14:07.572
CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH THE

02:14:07.639 --> 02:14:09.441
TECHNOLOGY WILL BE USED- AND IT

02:14:09.508 --> 02:14:10.909
SHOULD BE AUDIT REQUIREMENTS

02:14:10.976 --> 02:14:12.944
THAT YOU SHOULD KNOW WHO HAS

02:14:13.011 --> 02:14:15.247
USED THIS TECHNOLOGY. AND IF

02:14:15.313 --> 02:14:18.917
BEST. IT RESULT IN A MATCH I. A

02:14:18.984 --> 02:14:20.886
VERY OFTEN POLICE TECHNOLOGIES

02:14:20.952 --> 02:14:24.222
PROPAGATE- AND- USED- BUT WE

02:14:24.289 --> 02:14:24.756
DON'T HAVE ANSWERS TO THE

02:14:24.823 --> 02:14:25.991
FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION WHICH IS

02:14:26.057 --> 02:14:27.092
THIS ACTUALLY HELPING TO SOLVE

02:14:27.159 --> 02:14:29.394
CRIME WE OFTEN HEAR LONG LIST

02:14:29.461 --> 02:14:30.529
OF VERY COMPELLING ANECDOTES

02:14:30.595 --> 02:14:32.330
ABOUT THAT HIS CELL PARTICULAR

02:14:32.397 --> 02:14:33.532
CRIMES. BUT WE'RE TRYING TO

02:14:33.598 --> 02:14:34.466
FIGURE OUT WHETHER DO SOMETHING

02:14:34.533 --> 02:14:36.134
SYSTEMATICALLY WE SHOULD HAVE

02:14:36.201 --> 02:14:38.336
SYSTEMATIC EVIDENCE THANK YOU.

02:14:38.403 --> 02:14:39.538
THANKS VERY MUCH CHAU. MISTER

02:14:39.604 --> 02:14:44.176

CHAIRMAN CHAO WASTE YOUR KILEY

02:14:48.613 --> 02:14:49.047
AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE

02:14:49.114 --> 02:14:50.515
COMMITTEE I SINCERELY

02:14:50.582 --> 02:14:52.317
APPRECIATE THIS OPPORTUNITY.

02:14:52.384 --> 02:14:53.652
FISHER RECOGNITION IS IMPORTANT

02:14:53.718 --> 02:14:55.020
TECHNOLOGY IS ALREADY PROVIDED

02:14:55.086 --> 02:14:56.188
SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS TO OUR

02:14:56.254 --> 02:14:57.789
SOCIETY FOR EXAMPLE AS A

02:14:57.856 --> 02:14:59.324
BELIEVE WE DISCUSSED EARLIER

02:14:59.391 --> 02:15:00.392
THE TECHNOLOGY HAS HELPED

02:15:00.459 --> 02:15:01.860
IDENTIFY IN LEE TO THE RESCUE

02:15:01.927 --> 02:15:02.861
FROM CHAPTER TRAFFICKING

02:15:02.928 --> 02:15:04.463
VICTIMS. INCLUDING HERE IN

02:15:04.529 --> 02:15:06.531
CALIFORNIA. THE BENEFITS ALSO

02:15:06.598 --> 02:15:07.833
INCLUDE INCREASED CONVENIENCE

02:15:07.899 --> 02:15:09.634
FOR CONSUMERS AND A TEST OF THE

02:15:09.701 --> 02:15:10.902
LOS ANGELES INTERNATIONAL

02:15:10.969 --> 02:15:12.103
AIRPORT FISHER RECOGNITION

02:15:12.170 --> 02:15:13.905
REDUCE THE TIME IT TAKES TO

02:15:13.972 --> 02:15:15.040
BOARD A PLANE BY HALF.

02:15:15.106 --> 02:15:17.709
NONETHELESS FISHER RECOGNITION

02:15:17.776 --> 02:15:18.176
TECHNOLOGIES ALSO MISS

02:15:18.243 --> 02:15:19.678
UNDERSTOOD. THIS

02:15:19.744 --> 02:15:20.812
MISUNDERSTANDING IS ONE REASON

02:15:20.879 --> 02:15:22.714
WHY SOME OUR SOCIETY AKON FOR

02:15:22.781 --> 02:15:24.649
FACIAL RECOGNITION BANDS.

02:15:24.716 --> 02:15:25.584
IMPLEMENTING A BANNING

02:15:25.650 --> 02:15:26.384
CALIFORNIA WOULD BE THE WRONG

02:15:26.451 --> 02:15:28.854
APPROACH. TODAY LIKE TO FOCUS

02:15:28.920 --> 02:15:30.789
ON THREE THINGS FIRST I WOULD

02:15:30.856 --> 02:15:31.423
LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT THAT

02:15:31.490 --> 02:15:32.657
CALIFORNIANS ARE PROTECTED FROM

02:15:32.724 --> 02:15:34.025
POSSIBLE ABUSES OFFICIAL

02:15:34.092 --> 02:15:35.560
RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY AND

02:15:35.627 --> 02:15:37.028
SEVERAL WAYS INCLUDING BY STATE

02:15:37.095 --> 02:15:39.564
LAW. THE US CONSTITUTION AND

02:15:39.631 --> 02:15:40.465
SELF REGULATORY EFFORTS BY

02:15:40.532 --> 02:15:42.534
INDUSTRY. SECOND I WILL OFFER

02:15:42.601 --> 02:15:43.768
NUMEROUS WAYS LAWMAKERS CAN

02:15:43.835 --> 02:15:45.003
FURTHER PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S

02:15:45.070 --> 02:15:46.605
FROM POTENTIAL ABUSES OF THE

02:15:46.671 --> 02:15:48.540
TECHNOLOGY. THIRD I WOULD

02:15:48.607 --> 02:15:50.208
DISCUSS WIDE BAND OFFICIAL

02:15:50.275 --> 02:15:50.976
RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY

02:15:51.042 --> 02:15:52.944
TEMPORARY PERMIT IS NOT IN THE

02:15:53.011 --> 02:15:54.579
INTERESTS OF CALIFORNIA. BUT

02:15:54.646 --> 02:15:56.648
BACK TO MY INITIAL POINT. THE

02:15:56.715 --> 02:15:57.716
INAPPROPRIATE USE OF FACIAL

02:15:57.782 --> 02:15:59.284
RECOGNITION IS CONSTRAINED IN

02:15:59.351 --> 02:16:00.519
SEVERAL WAYS WHICH IS ONE

02:16:00.585 --> 02:16:01.887
REASON WHY TARGET REGULATIONS

02:16:01.953 --> 02:16:03.255
RATHER THAN BANDS IS THE BEST

02:16:03.321 --> 02:16:05.590
PATH FORWARD. FOR EXAMPLE THE

02:16:05.657 --> 02:16:06.791
NEWLY ENACTED CALIFORNIA

02:16:06.858 --> 02:16:08.360
CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT PROVIDES

02:16:08.426 --> 02:16:09.561
CALIFORNIA'S NUMEROUS PRIVACY

02:16:09.628 --> 02:16:11.196
RIGHTS BETWEEN THE COLLECTION

02:16:11.263 --> 02:16:12.230
USE AND SHARING OF PERSONAL

02:16:12.297 --> 02:16:14.065
DATA. INCLUDING IMAGERY OF THE

02:16:14.132 --> 02:16:17.602
FACE. THE LAW REQUIRES

02:16:17.669 --> 02:16:19.104
BUSINESSES TO INFORM CONSUMERS

02:16:19.170 --> 02:16:20.105
OF THEIR COLLECTING PERSONAL

02:16:20.171 --> 02:16:21.907
DATA CONSUMERS ALSO HAVE THE

02:16:21.973 --> 02:16:23.208
RIGHT TO KNOW THE REASON WHY A

02:16:23.275 --> 02:16:25.577
BUSINESS IS COLLECTING DATA AND

02:16:25.644 --> 02:16:26.177
IF THE BUSINESS TO SOME OF THE

02:16:26.244 --> 02:16:27.546
DATA AND TO HIM. BUSINESS IS

02:16:27.612 --> 02:16:28.847
ALSO UP TO DELETE PERSONAL DATA

02:16:28.914 --> 02:16:30.415
THE CONSUMERS REQUESTS AND

02:16:30.482 --> 02:16:31.449
CONSUMERS CAN BLOCKING

02:16:31.516 --> 02:16:32.684
ORGANIZATION FROM SELLING THEIR

02:16:32.751 --> 02:16:34.452
DATA. COLLECTIVELY THESE RIGHTS

02:16:34.519 --> 02:16:36.821
INCREASE THE TRANSPARENCY OF

02:16:36.888 --> 02:16:37.422
THE USE OF FACIAL RECOGNITION

02:16:37.489 --> 02:16:39.324
BY PRIVATE ACTORS. AND LIMIT

02:16:39.391 --> 02:16:40.825
POTENTIAL ABUSES SUCH AS THE

02:16:40.892 --> 02:16:42.060
UNWANTED SALE OFFICIAL

02:16:42.127 --> 02:16:44.195
RECOGNITION DATA. AND LAST YEAR

02:16:44.262 --> 02:16:46.932
CALIFORNIA ALSO PASSED AB

02:16:46.998 --> 02:16:47.766
TWELVE FIFTEEN ALSO KNOWN AS

02:16:47.832 --> 02:16:48.567
THE BODY CAMERA ACCOUNTABILITY%

02:16:48.633 --> 02:16:50.835
ACT THE ACT PROHIBITS LAW

02:16:50.902 --> 02:16:52.137
ENFORCEMENT FROM USING FISHER

02:16:52.203 --> 02:16:53.772
RECOGNITION IN CONJUNCTION OF

02:16:53.838 --> 02:16:55.574
BODY CAMERAS. IN ADDITION THE

02:16:55.640 --> 02:16:56.908
US CONSTITUTION LIKELY PROTECT

02:16:56.975 --> 02:16:57.909
CALIFORNIA'S FROM LAW

02:16:57.976 --> 02:16:58.777
ENFORCEMENT ABUSING THE

02:16:58.843 --> 02:17:00.345
TECHNOLOGY. A. D. THE USE OF

02:17:00.412 --> 02:17:01.580
FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY

02:17:01.646 --> 02:17:02.981
TO SEVILLE AN INDIVIDUAL FOR

02:17:03.048 --> 02:17:04.416
EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME WITHOUT

02:17:04.482 --> 02:17:06.251
A SEARCH WARRANT. IS LIKELY A

02:17:06.318 --> 02:17:06.751
VIOLATION OF THE FOURTH

02:17:06.818 --> 02:17:08.820
AMENDMENT. THE STATE OR PUBLIC

02:17:08.887 --> 02:17:10.255
BECAUSE TO MAKE AN ARREST ALSO

02:17:10.322 --> 02:17:12.757
PROTECTS CALIFORNIANS. FINALLY

02:17:12.824 --> 02:17:13.758
INDUSTRY HAS DEVELOPED

02:17:13.825 --> 02:17:15.260
VOLUNTARY SELF REGULATION AND

02:17:15.327 --> 02:17:16.928
PRINCIPLES TO FOSTER FOSTER THE

02:17:16.995 --> 02:17:17.963
RESPONSIBLE USE OF THE

02:17:18.029 --> 02:17:19.898
TECHNOLOGY. INDEED MANY OF THE

02:17:19.965 --> 02:17:21.299
LEADING FISHER RECOGNITION

02:17:21.366 --> 02:17:22.767
TECHNOLOGY VENDORS INCLUDING

02:17:22.834 --> 02:17:24.669
GOOGLE MICROSOFT AND AMAZON.

02:17:24.736 --> 02:17:25.737
HAVE DEVELOPED PRINCIPLES OUR

02:17:25.804 --> 02:17:27.539
GUIDANCE FOR THE USE OF FACIAL

02:17:27.606 --> 02:17:29.374
RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY. MY

02:17:29.441 --> 02:17:30.642
SECOND POINT IS THAT CALIFORNIA

02:17:30.709 --> 02:17:31.543
CAN IMPLEMENT ADDITIONAL

02:17:31.610 --> 02:17:32.844
PROTECTIONS TO PREVENT THE

02:17:32.911 --> 02:17:35.280
POTENTIAL ABUSES. ARE OR

02:17:35.347 --> 02:17:35.981
POTENTIAL MISUSE OF THE

02:17:36.047 --> 02:17:37.782
TECHNOLOGY. FOR EXAMPLE THE

02:17:37.849 --> 02:17:38.717
STATE LEGISLATURE SHOULD

02:17:38.783 --> 02:17:39.718
REQUIRE THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:17:39.784 --> 02:17:41.019
AGENCIES PUBLICLY DISCLOSED

02:17:41.086 --> 02:17:42.787
THEY ARE USING THE TECHNOLOGY.

02:17:42.854 --> 02:17:44.022
THE STATE SHOULD ALSO CAR THAT

02:17:44.089 --> 02:17:45.156
THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF

02:17:45.223 --> 02:17:46.157
JUSTICE ONE OF THE ROLE OF AN

02:17:46.224 --> 02:17:48.126
AGENCY ESTABLISHED PERFORMANCE

02:17:48.193 --> 02:17:48.793
STANDARDS FOR FACIAL

02:17:48.860 --> 02:17:50.295
RECOGNITION SYSTEMS. STANDARDS

02:17:50.362 --> 02:17:51.796
WHEN THE GOVERNMENT INCLUDING

02:17:51.863 --> 02:17:53.131
LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN YOU SPECIAL

02:17:53.198 --> 02:17:54.366
RECOGNITION AND SENSE OF

02:17:54.432 --> 02:17:54.866
ENVIRONMENTS SUCH AS AYE

02:17:54.933 --> 02:17:57.135
PROTESTS. AND POLICIES FOR HOW

02:17:57.202 --> 02:17:58.603
THE STATE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES

02:17:58.670 --> 02:18:01.406
CAN ACQUIRE AND SHARE PHOTOS

02:18:01.473 --> 02:18:02.040
USED FOR FACIAL RECOGNITION. IN

02:18:02.107 --> 02:18:03.408
ADDITION THE STATE SHOULD

02:18:03.475 --> 02:18:04.442
REQUIRE THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:18:04.509 --> 02:18:05.844
OBTAIN A WARRANT TO USE FACE

02:18:05.910 --> 02:18:07.879
RECOGNITION. OR ANY TECHNOLOGY

02:18:07.946 --> 02:18:09.114
TO TRACK THE LOCATION OF AN

02:18:09.180 --> 02:18:10.181
INDIVIDUAL OVER AN EXTENDED

02:18:10.248 --> 02:18:12.717
PERIOD OF TIME. FINALLY THE

02:18:12.784 --> 02:18:13.885
LEGISLATURE SHOULD REQUIRE HAT

02:18:13.952 --> 02:18:15.186
STATE AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:18:15.253 --> 02:18:16.788
ENTITIES HAVE WRITTEN POLICIES

02:18:16.855 --> 02:18:17.822
AND HOW THEY WERE USED THE

02:18:17.889 --> 02:18:19.557
TECHNOLOGY AS WELL AS ENCOURAGE

02:18:19.624 --> 02:18:21.326
LAW ENFORCEMENT TO POUT PILOT

02:18:21.393 --> 02:18:21.793
THE TECHNOLOGY BEFORE

02:18:21.860 --> 02:18:23.395
IMPLEMENTING IT. POUTING THE

02:18:23.461 --> 02:18:24.396
TECHNOLOGY WOULD HELP LAW

02:18:24.462 --> 02:18:25.363
ENFORCEMENT LEARN A PARTICULAR

02:18:25.430 --> 02:18:26.398
FISHER RECOGNITION SYSTEM

02:18:26.464 --> 02:18:28.633
STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES. AND

02:18:28.700 --> 02:18:29.934
ABOUT HOW PERFORMS IN THEIR OWN

02:18:30.001 --> 02:18:32.003
COMMUNITIES. IF CALIFORNIANS

02:18:32.070 --> 02:18:33.238
WERE TO SHAPE THE FUTURE OF

02:18:33.304 --> 02:18:35.173
THIS TOP TECHNOLOGY SHOULD KEEP

02:18:35.240 --> 02:18:36.808
A SET THE TABLE WHICH PILOTS

02:18:36.875 --> 02:18:38.510
CAN HELP IT DO. MY THIRD AND

02:18:38.576 --> 02:18:40.078
FINAL POINT. IS THAT THERE ARE

02:18:40.145 --> 02:18:41.246
SIGNIFICANT REASONS WHY THE

02:18:41.312 --> 02:18:42.414
LEGISLATURE SHOULD ADOPT

02:18:42.480 --> 02:18:44.149
TARGETED LEGISLATION. FOR

02:18:44.215 --> 02:18:45.216
FISHER RECOGNITION RATHER THAN

02:18:45.283 --> 02:18:47.786
BAND THE TECHNOLOGY. FIRST MANY

02:18:47.852 --> 02:18:49.154
CRITICS CONTRABAND STATE

02:18:49.220 --> 02:18:50.255
MISLEADING RESEARCH TO BOLSTER

02:18:50.321 --> 02:18:52.190
THEIR CLAIMS. FOR EXAMPLE THE

02:18:52.257 --> 02:18:53.425
AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION

02:18:53.491 --> 02:18:54.426
HAS PRODUCED TWO MISLEADING

02:18:54.492 --> 02:18:56.494
REPORTS. THE ENACT WE SUGGEST

02:18:56.561 --> 02:18:57.762
FACIAL RECOGNITION SYSTEMS ARE

02:18:57.829 --> 02:18:59.330
ACCURATE. AND THE FIRST REPORT

02:18:59.397 --> 02:19:00.999
THE A SO YOU USE AMAZON'S

02:19:01.066 --> 02:19:02.500
RECOGNITION SERVICE. TO COMPARE

02:19:02.567 --> 02:19:04.169
MUGSHOT IMAGES OF CRIMINALS TO

02:19:04.235 --> 02:19:05.570
PHOTOS. OF MEMBERS OF THE

02:19:05.637 --> 02:19:07.472
NIGHT'S IT'S CONGRESS. COVER

02:19:07.539 --> 02:19:08.973
THE ACER USE THAT ARTIFICIALLY

02:19:09.040 --> 02:19:11.109
LOW CONFIDENCE SPECIALS FOR

02:19:11.176 --> 02:19:12.043
MATCHING FACES. TO CREATE THESE

02:19:12.110 --> 02:19:13.378
RESULTS THAT MANY FALSE

02:19:13.445 --> 02:19:14.512
POSITIVES WERE ALLOWED WHICH I

02:19:14.579 --> 02:19:16.214
BELIEVE WE DISCUSSED EARLIER.

02:19:16.281 --> 02:19:18.116
INDEED AMAZON HAS NOTED THAT

02:19:18.183 --> 02:19:19.584
THE A STILL USE ERROR RATES FOR

02:19:19.651 --> 02:19:20.785
MATCHING MEMBERS OF THE UNITED

02:19:20.852 --> 02:19:21.686
STATES CONGRESS WOULD HAVE

02:19:21.753 --> 02:19:23.154
DROPPED TO ZERO. IF I TO USE AN

02:19:23.221 --> 02:19:24.756
APPROPRIATE CONFISCATED SKEWS

02:19:24.823 --> 02:19:27.625
ME APPROPRIATE CONFIDENCE

02:19:27.692 --> 02:19:29.260
THRESHOLD OF 99% THE ACLU

02:19:29.327 --> 02:19:30.729
REPEATED ITS TEST IN THE SAME

02:19:30.795 --> 02:19:32.363
MANNER FOR CALIFORNIA LAWMAKERS

02:19:32.430 --> 02:19:33.865
EVEN AFTER AMAZON HAVE PUBLICLY

02:19:33.932 --> 02:19:35.467
CLARIFIED ITS POSITION ON

02:19:35.533 --> 02:19:37.869
APPROPRIATE COMP AND SOCIALS.

02:19:37.936 --> 02:19:39.571
SECOND THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE

02:19:39.637 --> 02:19:40.572
OF STANDARDS AND TECHNOLOGY HAS

02:19:40.638 --> 02:19:41.506
FOUND THAT THE BEST FACIAL

02:19:41.573 --> 02:19:43.074
RECOGNITION ALGORITHMS ARE

02:19:43.141 --> 02:19:44.909
EXTREMELY ACCURATE. FOR EXAMPLE

02:19:44.976 --> 02:19:46.478
THE BEST OUR THEM THIS TESTED

02:19:46.544 --> 02:19:47.746
IN A TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN

02:19:47.812 --> 02:19:49.314
REPORT FILTERING THE CORRECT

02:19:49.380 --> 02:19:50.682
CANDIDATE AS THE MOST LIKELY

02:19:50.749 --> 02:19:52.751
MATCH ONLY ZERO ONE POINT 2% OF

02:19:52.817 --> 02:19:54.119
THE TIME WHEN PERFORMING A

02:19:54.185 --> 02:19:55.186
SEARCH OF A DATABASE THAT

02:19:55.253 --> 02:19:57.021
CONTAINED. IMAGES OF THREE

02:19:57.088 --> 02:20:01.893
MILLION INDIVIDUALS. THIRD THE

02:20:01.960 --> 02:20:02.527
BEST FACIAL RECOGNITION SYSTEMS

02:20:02.594 --> 02:20:03.762
HAVE NO OR LITTLE BIAS. IN THIS

02:20:03.828 --> 02:20:05.630
REPORT. ACTOR ALBUMS HAVE

02:20:05.697 --> 02:20:08.133
UNDETECTABLE BIASES-

02:20:08.199 --> 02:20:09.768
UNDETECTABLE EXCUSE ME

02:20:09.834 --> 02:20:10.402
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN DEMOGRAPHIC

02:20:10.468 --> 02:20:12.604
GROUPS. THIS IS A VERY

02:20:12.670 --> 02:20:13.404
SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE THE

02:20:13.471 --> 02:20:14.873
MOTIVATION FOR MANY OF THE

02:20:14.939 --> 02:20:16.341
BANDS IS A CONCERN ABOUT RACIAL

02:20:16.407 --> 02:20:19.144
BIAS BUT IS SIMPLY NOT TRUE FOR

02:20:19.210 --> 02:20:21.146
THE BEST PERFORMING ALGORITHMS.

02:20:21.212 --> 02:20:22.914
FOURTH FANS CAN HAVE UNINTENDED

02:20:22.981 --> 02:20:24.716
CONSEQUENCES FOR EXAMPLE SAN

02:20:24.783 --> 02:20:26.317
FRANCISCO'S BAN A GOVERNMENT

02:20:26.384 --> 02:20:27.051
AGENCIES USING FACIAL

02:20:27.118 --> 02:20:28.787
RECOGNITION MEDIA LEGAL FOR THE

02:20:28.853 --> 02:20:30.155
SEASON POINTS YOU CITY ISSUE

02:20:30.221 --> 02:20:31.456
OUR PHONES WHICH USE FACIAL

02:20:31.523 --> 02:20:33.925
RECOGNITION. FIFTH THIS IS NOT

02:20:33.992 --> 02:20:34.826
THE FIRST TIME WE'VE HEARD

02:20:34.893 --> 02:20:36.194
CLAIMS A TECHNOLOGY WILL LEAD

02:20:36.261 --> 02:20:37.996
TO WIDESPREAD SURVEILLANCE FOR

02:20:38.062 --> 02:20:39.397
EXAMPLE IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES

02:20:39.464 --> 02:20:40.765
MANY PEOPLE FEEL TRANSISTOR

02:20:40.832 --> 02:20:42.667
FEARED TRANSISTORS WOULD SPELL

02:20:42.734 --> 02:20:44.669
THE END OF PIRACY AS MINIATURE

02:20:44.736 --> 02:20:46.271
ELECTRONICS COULD BE USED USED

02:20:46.337 --> 02:20:47.839
UP ON PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS.

02:20:47.906 --> 02:20:49.374
AND IN THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS

02:20:49.440 --> 02:20:52.510
PRIVACY ADVOCATES CALLED FOR

02:20:52.577 --> 02:20:53.044
BANDS OF RFID CHIPS WE USE

02:20:53.111 --> 02:20:54.412
RATED WHICH USE RADIO WAVES TO

02:20:54.479 --> 02:20:56.714
TRANSMIT. DATA AND THE FEARS

02:20:56.781 --> 02:20:57.749
THAT STORES GOVERNMENTS ARE

02:20:57.816 --> 02:20:59.317
TERRACE TRACKING INDIVIDUALS

02:20:59.384 --> 02:21:01.553
WITH RFID NEVER MATERIALIZED

IN JUST A COUPLE OF YEARS. WE

02:26:02.320 --> 02:26:03.521
NEED TO ENSURE THAT ANY

CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE TO ENACT

OTHER BIOMETRIC HARVESTING

02:26:48.466 --> 02:26:50.768
UNDER THAT LAW. SOME CONSUMERS

02:26:50.835 --> 02:26:51.936
MIGHT BELIEVE IT'S IN THEIR

02:26:52.003 --> 02:26:53.304
INTEREST TO ALLOW THIS IS TO

02:26:53.371 --> 02:26:54.639
COLLECT THEIR FACE PRINT FOR

02:26:54.705 --> 02:26:56.107

CONSUMER TO WEIGH THE PROS AND

02:27:03.714 --> 02:27:06.450
CONS FOR THEM. OF DOING SO- IT

02:27:06.517 --> 02:27:07.618
SHOULD BE THEIR OWN ECONOMIST

02:27:07.685 --> 02:27:09.120
CHOICE FREELY GIVEN. AND IT

02:27:09.187 --> 02:27:10.454
SHOULD NOT BE BUSINESSES THAT

ASIDE FOR CONSUMERS- WEATHER

02:27:13.391 --> 02:27:13.891
APP THIS IS IN THE CONSUMERS

02:27:13.958 --> 02:27:16.027
INTERESTS. TO BE CLEAR IT IS A

02:27:16.093 --> 02:27:18.129
NOT ENOUGH WE BELIEVE. FOR

02:27:18.196 --> 02:27:19.430
STATE LAW TO REQUIRE BUSINESS

02:27:19.497 --> 02:27:21.866
SIMPLY TO NOTIFY CONSUMERS THAT

FACE RECOGNITION IS GOING ON

02:27:23.167 --> 02:27:25.336
EITHER IN A PHYSICAL PLACE OR

02:27:25.403 --> 02:27:27.705
IN A DIGITAL PLACE. THAT GIVES

02:27:27.772 --> 02:27:29.240
THE POWER OF CHOICE TO THE

02:27:29.307 --> 02:27:30.541
BUSINESSES AND NOT TO THE

02:27:30.608 --> 02:27:32.176
CONSUMERS- EXCEPT IN THE NARROW

02:27:32.243 --> 02:27:33.878
SENSE THAT CONSUMER CAN REFUSE

TO GO- ON THE INTERNET OR TO

02:27:36.514 --> 02:27:38.149
PUBLIC PLACES WHICH WE THINK IS

02:27:38.216 --> 02:27:39.717
REALLY. AT NO CHOICE AT ALL IN

02:27:39.784 --> 02:27:42.286
IN THIS DAY AND AGE I DO WANT

JUSTICE SYSTEM NUMBER TWO- OVER

02:28:37.575 --> 02:28:40.077
TIME NEW TECHNOLOGIES HAVE BEEN

02:28:40.144 --> 02:28:42.113
DEPLOYED DESPERATELY TO

02:28:42.179 --> 02:28:43.848
MINORITY COMMUNITIES AND

THE ERROR BIAS WHICH IS A

02:29:03.668 --> 02:29:06.237
SERIOUS ISSUE- I WOULD URGE

DOES SHOW THAT HAS SOME OF THE

02:29:16.947 --> 02:29:18.282
ERROR IS GOING DOWN WITH SOME

02:29:18.349 --> 02:29:20.351
OF THE SYSTEMS. IT ALSO SHOWS

02:29:20.418 --> 02:29:21.719
THAT A LOT OF ERROR IS

02:29:21.786 --> 02:29:22.920
CONTINUING WITH A LOT OF THE

02:29:22.987 --> 02:29:23.988

BE TALKING ABOUT- GOVERNMENT

02:29:26.157 --> 02:29:27.958
USE OF FACE RECOGNITION OR

02:29:28.025 --> 02:29:29.760
BUSINESSES ARE USING IT WITHOUT

02:29:29.827 --> 02:29:31.595
CONSENT WELL THOSE- ISSUES

02:29:31.662 --> 02:29:33.297
LINGER. WE'VE HEARD ABOUT

02:29:33.364 --> 02:29:35.533
EXONERATION NO DOUBT- THERE ARE

02:29:35.599 --> 02:29:36.734
A LOT OF PEOPLE BEHIND BARS WHO

02:29:36.801 --> 02:29:37.902
DON'T BELONG THERE AND WE

02:29:37.968 --> 02:29:39.003
SHOULD DO IT WE SHOULD SOLVE

02:29:39.070 --> 02:29:40.304
THOSE PROBLEMS BY GOING TO THE

02:29:40.371 --> 02:29:41.839
ROOT OF THE PROBLEM SUCH AS-

02:29:41.906 --> 02:29:42.773
HAVING BETTER FIGHTER.

02:29:42.840 --> 02:29:44.875

CARS XIN AS THOSE TWO I'M DOING

02:29:50.114 --> 02:29:51.682
THIS KIND OF INDIRECT APPROACH

02:29:51.749 --> 02:29:54.852
TO THE PROBLEM- BY THROWING

02:29:54.919 --> 02:29:55.619
MORE TECHNOLOGY AT IT. I DO

02:29:55.686 --> 02:29:56.520
WANT TO FINALLY JUST NOTE THE

02:29:56.587 --> 02:29:57.755
PROBLEM OF MISSION CREEP YOU

02:29:57.822 --> 02:29:59.490
KNOW WE'VE HEARD THE IDEA. THAT

02:29:59.557 --> 02:30:00.658
WE CAN BEGIN JUST BY

02:30:00.725 --> 02:30:02.426
IDENTIFYING A NOTE SUSPECT IN A

02:30:02.493 --> 02:30:04.128
PHOTOGRAPH BUT WE WON'T SEE YOU

SURVEILLANCE AND COMMUNITY

02:30:09.133 --> 02:30:10.935
PLACES. BUT WE'VE HEARD TODAY

02:30:11.001 --> 02:30:12.636

HEAR THAT PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT

02:30:32.289 --> 02:30:34.558

IN THAT CREATE A LOT OF

02:31:50.434 --> 02:31:52.503
CONCERNS ABOUT THE IMPLICATIONS

02:32:07.017 --> 02:32:09.119
CHALLENGES FRANKLY THAT WE'VE

02:32:09.186 --> 02:32:11.689

ADVOCATE AS WE'VE DONE SINCE

02:32:26.003 --> 02:32:26.604
TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE FOR

02:32:26.670 --> 02:32:27.872
COMPREHENSIVE PRIVACY LAWS IN

RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY THAT'S

02:32:35.379 --> 02:32:38.516
BEEN CONTROVERSY. IT'S BECAUSE

02:32:38.582 --> 02:32:40.050
SOME OF OUR FRIENDS IN INDUSTRY

02:32:40.117 --> 02:32:42.353
TO CRITICIZE US FOR ASKING FOR

02:32:42.419 --> 02:32:44.054

QUOTE LEGITIMIZE TECHNOLOGY. I

02:33:01.272 --> 02:33:02.940
THINK THAT PRESENTS A AN

THE VERY SERIOUS CONCERNS THAT

THE TECHNOLOGY POSES. SO

02:33:41.845 --> 02:33:43.280
THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT FACE

02:33:43.347 --> 02:33:45.049

02:34:52.282 --> 02:34:54.718
WITH THE CONCERNS. THE CONCERNS

02:34:54.785 --> 02:34:56.420
ABOUT BIAS IN THEM AND

02:34:56.487 --> 02:34:57.488
DISCRIMINATION THERE ARE

02:34:57.554 --> 02:34:59.323
ABSOLUTELY STUDIES AND IT DOES

02:34:59.390 --> 02:35:00.991
NO ONE ANY GOOD TO SHY AWAY

02:35:01.058 --> 02:35:03.060
FROM THEM THAT SHOW THAT THE

02:35:03.127 --> 02:35:04.595
TECHNOLOGY IN MANY INSTANCES

02:35:04.662 --> 02:35:06.563
HAS BEEN MORE ACCURATE FOR

02:35:06.630 --> 02:35:08.265
YOUNG WHITE MALES THAN IT HAS

02:35:08.332 --> 02:35:11.635
BEEN FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR THAN

02:35:11.702 --> 02:35:12.269
IT HAS BEEN FOR WOMEN THAT BEEN

02:35:12.336 --> 02:35:15.673
FOR OLDER PEOPLE. THOSE THINGS

02:35:15.739 --> 02:35:18.709
SHOULD CONCERN ALL OF US.

02:35:18.776 --> 02:35:19.677
THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE

02:35:19.743 --> 02:35:21.512
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRIVACY AND

02:35:21.578 --> 02:35:23.614
CIVIL LIBERTIES WITH THE

CONTINUED DEPLOYMENT OF CAMERAS

02:35:25.683 --> 02:35:28.886
IN PUBLIC SPACES. AND THE RAPID

02:35:32.856 --> 02:35:35.726
CONCERNS ABOUT. SURVEILLANCE OF

02:35:35.793 --> 02:35:39.596
THE PUBLIC. BASS A RECOGNITION

02:35:39.663 --> 02:35:42.066
TECHNOLOGY SHOULD NOT BE USED

02:35:42.132 --> 02:35:42.700
TO CONDUCT MASS SURVEILLANCE OF

02:35:42.766 --> 02:35:49.273
THE PUBLIC. SO. THEIR CONCERNS

02:35:49.339 --> 02:35:51.175
AS WELL ABOUT DUE PROCESS THESE

02:35:51.241 --> 02:35:52.576
ARE CONCERNS FRANKLY THAT

02:35:52.643 --> 02:35:55.045
RELATE TO THE USE OF A AYE MORE

02:35:55.112 --> 02:35:57.614
GENERALLY PARTICULARLY A BLACK

BOX ALGORITHMS OUR ALGORITHMS

02:35:59.883 --> 02:36:01.952
WHICH ARE VERY GOOD AT DERIVING

02:36:02.019 --> 02:36:04.221
CONCLUSIONS FROM BROAD SETS OF

02:36:04.288 --> 02:36:05.989

BROAD SETS OF DATA BUT WHICH

02:36:08.225 --> 02:36:11.495
AREN'T AS GOOD. AT TELLING US

02:36:11.562 --> 02:36:11.995
HOW THEY ARRIVE AT THOSE

02:36:12.062 --> 02:36:14.465
CONCLUSIONS. THOSE KINDS OF

02:36:14.531 --> 02:36:16.667
PROGRAMS CAMPOS REAL CHALLENGES

02:36:16.734 --> 02:36:18.469
IF THEY ARE GOING TO BE USED IN

02:36:18.535 --> 02:36:20.170
CONJUNCTION WITH DECISIONS

02:36:20.237 --> 02:36:22.406
ABOUT PEOPLE THAT WOULD HAVE

02:36:22.473 --> 02:36:24.141
CONSEQUENTIAL AFFECTS OR LEGAL

02:36:24.208 --> 02:36:25.375

INSURANCE EDUCATION SECTOR. SO

02:36:31.548 --> 02:36:34.051
HOW CAN WE START TO ADDRESS

02:36:34.118 --> 02:36:37.121
THOSE CONCERNS. WELL MAKING

02:36:37.187 --> 02:36:39.923
SURE WE ENABLE THE BENEFITS THE

02:36:39.990 --> 02:36:41.792
TECHNOLOGY IS PROVIDING THERE

02:36:41.859 --> 02:36:43.227
ARE CERTAIN THINGS THAT

02:36:43.293 --> 02:36:46.864
COMPANIES CAN DO THEMSELVES. SO

02:36:46.930 --> 02:36:49.433
THESE ARE THE KINDS OF CONCERNS.

02:36:49.500 --> 02:36:51.635
THAT LED MICROSOFT FOR EXAMPLE

02:36:51.702 --> 02:36:53.203
TO CREATE AN ETHICS COMMITTEE

02:36:53.270 --> 02:36:56.406
WITHIN THE COMPANY. THE ETHER

02:36:56.473 --> 02:36:57.608
COMMITTEE AND I ALWAYS BLANK ON

02:36:57.674 --> 02:36:59.042
WHAT YOU THROUGH MEANS THE A.

02:36:59.109 --> 02:37:00.811
I. IN ETHICS IN ENGINEERING AND

02:37:00.878 --> 02:37:02.513
RESEARCH COMMITTEE IT'S AN

02:37:02.579 --> 02:37:03.347
ETHICS COMMITTEE THAT CONSISTS

02:37:03.413 --> 02:37:05.682
OF SENIOR MEMBERS ARE SENIOR

02:37:05.749 --> 02:37:08.218
LEADERS AROUND THE COMPANY.

02:37:08.285 --> 02:37:09.920
WHICH PRODUCED AND PUBLISHED A

02:37:09.987 --> 02:37:11.054
SET OF ETHICAL PRINCIPLES THAT

02:37:11.121 --> 02:37:13.056
GOVERN THE WAY WE DEVELOP AND

02:37:13.123 --> 02:37:14.858
DEPLOY THE TECHNOLOGY. THEY

02:37:14.925 --> 02:37:17.694
REVIEW HOW WE'RE DOING AND

02:37:17.761 --> 02:37:18.262
WHETHER WE'RE COMPLYING WITH

02:37:18.328 --> 02:37:20.864
OUR PRINCIPLES. DAVE USE THAT

02:37:20.931 --> 02:37:24.501
TO TURN DOWN BUSINESS. WE FOR

02:37:24.568 --> 02:37:26.436
EXAMPLE HAVE TURNED DOWN

02:37:26.503 --> 02:37:28.205
PROPOSALS TO DEPLOY FACIAL

02:37:28.272 --> 02:37:29.807
RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY ON

02:37:29.873 --> 02:37:31.575
POLICE BODY WORN CAMERAS

02:37:31.642 --> 02:37:33.210
BECAUSE WE THINK IT WOULD BE

02:37:33.277 --> 02:37:34.978
UNETHICAL TO DO SO. THE

02:37:35.045 --> 02:37:37.147
TECHNOLOGY IS NOT THERE IT'S

02:37:37.214 --> 02:37:39.116
INACCURATE AND THE RISKS OF

02:37:39.183 --> 02:37:41.018
GETTING SOMETHING WRONG IN THE

02:37:41.084 --> 02:37:43.353
SCENARIOS IN WHICH IT WOULD BE

02:37:43.420 --> 02:37:46.723
DEPLOYED ARE FAR TOO GREAT.

02:37:46.790 --> 02:37:47.825
IT'S THE KIND OF THING THAT LED

02:37:47.891 --> 02:37:49.726
US TO DEVELOP A SIMILAR SET OF

02:37:49.793 --> 02:37:52.062
ETHICAL PRINCIPLES SPECIFICALLY

02:37:52.129 --> 02:37:52.529
FOR FACIAL RECOGNITION

02:37:52.596 --> 02:37:56.333
TECHNOLOGY. BUT SELF REGULATION

02:37:56.400 --> 02:38:00.103
IS NOT ENOUGH. NONE OF US

02:38:00.170 --> 02:38:01.471
SHOULD BE COMFORTABLE WITH

02:38:01.538 --> 02:38:04.374
RELYING UPON CORPORATIONS TO

02:38:04.441 --> 02:38:06.109
REGULATE THEMSELVES AND MAKE

02:38:06.176 --> 02:38:08.512
THEIR OWN DECISIONS IN THIS

02:38:08.579 --> 02:38:09.713
SPACE THE TECHNOLOGIES TOO

02:38:09.780 --> 02:38:11.181
POWERFUL THE RISKS ARE TOO

02:38:11.248 --> 02:38:15.385
GREAT. AND FRANKLY NOT EVERY

02:38:15.452 --> 02:38:18.355
ORGANIZATION WILL HAVE THE WILL

02:38:18.422 --> 02:38:19.923
OR THE RESOURCES OF A PLACE

02:38:19.990 --> 02:38:23.694
LIKE MICROSOFT. TO IMPOSE RULES

02:38:23.760 --> 02:38:27.264
UPON ITSELF. WE'VE ALREADY SEEN

02:38:27.331 --> 02:38:29.967
RECENT EXAMPLES PERHAPS OF THAT

02:38:30.033 --> 02:38:32.536
IN THE PRESS AND FRANKLY. A

02:38:32.603 --> 02:38:34.171
RACE TO THE BOTTOM IN AN

02:38:34.238 --> 02:38:35.505
UNFETTERED MARKETPLACE BENEFITS

02:38:35.572 --> 02:38:40.377
NO ONE. IT'S WHY WE HAVE BEEN

02:38:40.444 --> 02:38:42.546
CALLING SINCE THE SUMMER OF TWO

02:38:42.613 --> 02:38:43.313
THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN

02:38:43.380 --> 02:38:45.349
SPECIFICALLY FOR GOVERNMENT TO

02:38:45.415 --> 02:38:51.154
STEP IN AND PASS LAWS. SO WHAT

02:38:51.221 --> 02:38:54.291
SHOULD THOSE LAWS LOOK LIKE.

02:38:54.358 --> 02:38:56.760
WE'VE SUPPORTED LEGISLATION IN

02:38:56.827 --> 02:38:59.129
OUR HOME STATE OF WASHINGTON.

02:38:59.196 --> 02:39:00.330
HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE WOULD

02:39:00.397 --> 02:39:01.565
APPLAUD YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR

02:39:01.632 --> 02:39:03.767
YOUR LEADERSHIP IN INTRODUCING

02:39:03.834 --> 02:39:05.636
AB TWO TWO SIX ONE WE'VE

02:39:05.702 --> 02:39:07.104
SUPPORTED LEGISLATION IN OTHER

02:39:07.170 --> 02:39:09.039
PLACES THAT WOULD REGULATE BOTH

02:39:09.106 --> 02:39:11.074
THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND THE

02:39:11.141 --> 02:39:12.843
PUBLIC SECTOR IN THEIR USE AND

02:39:12.910 --> 02:39:16.313
DEVELOPMENT OF TECHNOLOGY- OF

02:39:16.380 --> 02:39:17.981
FACE RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY.

02:39:18.048 --> 02:39:21.351
FOR EXAMPLE. WE'VE SUPPORTED

02:39:21.418 --> 02:39:23.120
RESTRICTIONS ON THE PRIVATE

02:39:23.186 --> 02:39:25.289
SECTOR RULES THAT WOULD REQUIRE

02:39:25.355 --> 02:39:27.925
IT FOR EXAMPLE TO ADDRESS

02:39:27.991 --> 02:39:29.526
CONCERNS OF BY SYMPTOMS AND

02:39:29.593 --> 02:39:31.161
DISCRIMINATION BY REQUIRING

02:39:31.228 --> 02:39:33.196
THEM TO TEST THE TECHNOLOGY

02:39:33.263 --> 02:39:33.697
TECHNOLOGY FOR BIAS AND

02:39:33.764 --> 02:39:36.099
DISCRIMINATION. BY REQUIRING

02:39:36.166 --> 02:39:38.302
THEM TO ENABLE INDEPENDENT

02:39:38.368 --> 02:39:39.670
THIRD PARTIES TO TEST THE

02:39:39.736 --> 02:39:41.571
TECHNOLOGY FOR BY CENTER AND

02:39:41.638 --> 02:39:42.139
DISCRIMINATION WHETHER IT'S

02:39:42.205 --> 02:39:44.875
THROUGH. THE EIGHTEEN AN API AN

02:39:44.942 --> 02:39:45.776
APPLICATION PROGRAMMING

02:39:45.842 --> 02:39:47.044
INTERFACE OR SOME OTHER

02:39:47.110 --> 02:39:48.645
MECHANISM TO ALLOW THIRD

02:39:48.712 --> 02:39:50.314
PARTIES TO TEST THE TECHNOLOGY

02:39:50.380 --> 02:39:53.417
NOT ALL COMPANIES DO THAT. BY

02:39:53.483 --> 02:39:56.653
REQUIRING THEM. TO HAVE TO PUT

02:39:56.720 --> 02:39:58.655
IN PLACE A PLAN TO ADDRESS ANY

02:39:58.722 --> 02:40:00.791
CONCERNS ANY INACCURACIES IN

02:40:00.857 --> 02:40:03.060
ERRORS AND BIASES PARTICULARLY

02:40:03.126 --> 02:40:05.862
ERRORS IN BY A SEIZE ACROSS A

02:40:05.929 --> 02:40:08.532
POPULATIONS- TO ACTUALLY PUT IN

02:40:08.598 --> 02:40:10.434
PLACE PLANS TO START TO ADDRESS

02:40:10.500 --> 02:40:12.269
THOSE THINGS. WE THINK IT'S

02:40:12.336 --> 02:40:13.737
IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE HAVE SEEN

02:40:13.804 --> 02:40:15.072
OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS

02:40:15.138 --> 02:40:17.341
THAT COMPANIES WHO HAVE EXPOSED

02:40:17.407 --> 02:40:19.643
THEIR TECHNOLOGY TO INDEPENDENT

02:40:19.710 --> 02:40:21.878
TESTING. TO THE SORT OF PUBLIC

02:40:21.945 --> 02:40:23.380
SHAMING THAT FRANKLY WE WERE

02:40:23.447 --> 02:40:26.083
PART OF WITH THE RECENT MIT

02:40:26.149 --> 02:40:28.185
GENDER SHOULD STUDY. A STUDY

02:40:28.251 --> 02:40:30.220
THAT IN TWO THOUSAND AND

02:40:30.287 --> 02:40:31.855
EIGHTEEN TESTED THE GENDER

02:40:31.922 --> 02:40:35.559
CLASSIFIER FOR VARIOUS- FACE

02:40:35.625 --> 02:40:37.094
RECOGNITION ALGORITHMS AND

02:40:37.160 --> 02:40:40.063
COMPARED THE ERROR RATES ACROSS

02:40:40.130 --> 02:40:43.433
VARIOUS SUBGROUPS. FIRST SET OF

02:40:43.500 --> 02:40:45.469
RESULTS WAS REVEALED IN TWO

02:40:45.535 --> 02:40:47.704
THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN AND- FOR

02:40:47.771 --> 02:40:49.106
OUR OUT PROGRAMS FRANKLY THEY

02:40:49.172 --> 02:40:52.776
WERE EMBARRASSING. THE ERROR

02:40:52.843 --> 02:40:55.045
RATE FOR WHITE MEN WAS 0% AS

02:40:55.112 --> 02:40:58.482
YOU MIGHT GUESS. THE ERROR RATE

02:40:58.548 --> 02:41:01.385
FOR BLACK MEN WAS 6% THE ERROR

02:41:01.451 --> 02:41:02.452
RATE FOR WHITE WOMEN WAS ONE

02:41:02.519 --> 02:41:04.588
POINT 7% TO AIR IT FOR BLACK

02:41:04.654 --> 02:41:08.492
WOMEN WAS TWENTY POINT 8%

02:41:08.558 --> 02:41:13.330
ACCEPTABLE. IT EMBARRASSED OUR

02:41:13.397 --> 02:41:14.464
ENGINEERING TEAM SO THEY GOT TO

02:41:14.531 --> 02:41:16.466
WORK IMPROVING THE ALGORITHMS

02:41:16.533 --> 02:41:19.302
AND SPECIFICALLY IMPROVING THE

02:41:19.369 --> 02:41:20.971
QUALITY AND THE PROPORTIONALITY

02:41:21.038 --> 02:41:22.205
OF THE DATA SETS THEY WERE

02:41:22.272 --> 02:41:24.741
USING TO TRAIN THEIR ALGORITHMS

02:41:24.808 --> 02:41:26.910
WE CAME BACK A YEAR LATER. THE

02:41:26.977 --> 02:41:28.645
ERROR RATES WERE AGAIN 0% FOR

02:41:28.712 --> 02:41:30.647
WHITE MEN POINT 3% FOR BLACK

02:41:30.714 --> 02:41:35.619
MEN. POINT 3% FOR WHITE WOMEN.

02:41:35.685 --> 02:41:37.888
IN ONE POINT 5% FOR BLACK WOMEN

02:41:37.954 --> 02:41:40.524
NOT WHERE WE WOULD LIKE THEM.

02:41:40.590 --> 02:41:41.625
BUT WE'VE SEEN DRAMATIC

02:41:41.691 --> 02:41:42.559
IMPROVEMENTS AND WE'VE SEEN

02:41:42.626 --> 02:41:43.827
THAT WITH RESPECT TO OTHER

02:41:43.894 --> 02:41:45.962
TESTING AS WELL. WE'VE

02:41:46.029 --> 02:41:48.198
SUPPORTED. RULES THAT WOULD

02:41:48.265 --> 02:41:50.634
REQUIRE. SIMILAR TO WHAT MISTER

02:41:50.700 --> 02:41:52.769
SHORTS IS SUGGESTING CONSENT IN

02:41:52.836 --> 02:41:55.038
ORDER TO ENROLL AN IMAGE OPT IN

02:41:55.105 --> 02:41:56.973
CONSENT IN ORDER TO ENROLL AN

02:41:57.040 --> 02:42:00.477
IMAGE OR A TEMPLATE CREATED BY.

02:42:00.544 --> 02:42:02.446
YOUR IMAGE AND A FACIAL

02:42:02.512 --> 02:42:04.414
RECOGNITION DATABASE WE'VE

02:42:04.481 --> 02:42:06.416
SUPPORTED OTHER RULES THAT

02:42:06.483 --> 02:42:08.218
WOULD REQUIRE TRANSPARENCY THAT

02:42:08.285 --> 02:42:10.587
WOULD REQUIRE FOR EXAMPLE A

02:42:10.654 --> 02:42:12.823
PERSON TO BE IN THE LOOP. MEAN

02:42:12.889 --> 02:42:14.091
FOR HUMAN REVIEW OF SOMEONE WHO

02:42:14.157 --> 02:42:16.126
IS IN POWER TO CHANGE A

02:42:16.193 --> 02:42:17.661
DECISION THAT MIGHT BE MADE

02:42:17.727 --> 02:42:20.263
ABOUT AN INDIVIDUAL- FOR

02:42:20.330 --> 02:42:21.665
SIGNIFICANT DECISIONS ABOUT

02:42:21.731 --> 02:42:23.266
PEOPLE IF FACE RECOGNITION

02:42:23.333 --> 02:42:24.768
TECHNOLOGY IS TO BE USED IN

02:42:24.835 --> 02:42:25.368
CONJUNCTION WITH THOSE

02:42:25.435 --> 02:42:27.671
DECISIONS. NAMELY DECISIONS

02:42:27.737 --> 02:42:30.107
THAT WOULD HAVE CONSEQUENTIAL

02:42:30.173 --> 02:42:32.642
ILLEGAL AFFECTS ON PEOPLE. AND

02:42:32.709 --> 02:42:35.112
FRANKLY WE ALSO HAVE SUPPORTED

02:42:35.178 --> 02:42:37.247
AND DO SUPPORT RESTRICTIONS ON

02:42:37.314 --> 02:42:38.281
THE GOVERNMENT'S USE OF

02:42:38.348 --> 02:42:41.651
TECHNOLOGY. RULES THAT WOULD

02:42:41.718 --> 02:42:44.087
REQUIRE GREATER OVERSIGHT AND

02:44:16.947 --> 02:44:18.215
WE'VE SEEN AS AT OTHER TIMES IN

OUR HISTORY THE EXAMPLE OF WIRE

02:44:19.950 --> 02:44:22.719
TAPS IS A GOOD ONE. POWERFUL

02:44:22.786 --> 02:44:24.254
TECHNOLOGY THAT CAN GIVE THE

SUPPORT AND HAVE SUPPORTED

02:44:34.397 --> 02:44:36.800
RULES THAT FOR EXAMPLE WOULD

02:44:36.866 --> 02:44:38.568

METHODS TO COLLECT THE EVIDENCE

OR THAT THOSE SORTS OF METHODS-

02:45:16.873 --> 02:45:18.708
WOULD BE UNREASONABLY DANGEROUS

02:45:18.775 --> 02:45:19.843
ARE ON RECENTLY LIKELY TO

02:45:43.500 --> 02:45:45.735
THAT OCCURRED TO ME AS I WAS

02:45:45.802 --> 02:45:47.604
THINKING ABOUT THE HISTORY OF.

02:45:47.671 --> 02:45:52.142

SORTS OF BENEFITS BUT ALSO

02:46:02.052 --> 02:46:03.520
POTENTIALLY GAVE THE GOVERNMENT

02:46:03.586 --> 02:46:05.288
A WINDOW INTO PRIVATE

02:46:05.355 --> 02:46:07.290
CONVERSATIONS THAT PEOPLE USED

02:46:07.357 --> 02:46:08.792

02:46:08.858 --> 02:46:12.595
THE TELEGRAPH AND THE TELEPHONE.

02:46:12.662 --> 02:46:14.364
AND WE SAW A LOT OF CONTROVERSY

02:46:14.431 --> 02:46:15.398
AND UNEASE ABOUT THE

02:46:15.465 --> 02:46:19.803

TWENTY SEVEN INITIALLY RULED

02:46:25.608 --> 02:46:26.676
THAT THE GOVERNMENT DID NOT

02:46:26.743 --> 02:46:28.378
NEED A WARRANT IN ORDER TO

02:46:28.445 --> 02:46:30.413

THE MEDIA OUTCRY INFECTED

02:46:36.686 --> 02:46:38.088

02:46:46.563 --> 02:46:48.898
REALLY FIX THE PROBLEMS OF THE

SEIZURES IN THEIR PHONE CALLS

02:47:14.124 --> 02:47:14.557
IN THAT GOVERNMENT COULD

02:47:14.624 --> 02:47:16.393
VIOLATE THAT. WITHOUT

VIEW SOME OF THE RESTRICTIONS

02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:25.301
THAT WE HAVE SUPPORTED IN IN

02:47:25.368 --> 02:47:27.036

USING CELL SITE LOCATION

02:47:44.187 --> 02:47:48.191
INFORMATION. WE THINK THE SAME

02:47:48.258 --> 02:47:49.392
SORT OF PRINCIPLES AT MINIMUM I

02:47:49.459 --> 02:47:51.394
TO APPLY TO THE GOVERNMENT'S

02:47:51.461 --> 02:47:52.996
SIMILAR USE OF FACE RECOGNITION

02:47:53.062 --> 02:47:55.298
TECHNOLOGY IN SIMILAR

02:47:55.365 --> 02:47:58.168
CIRCUMSTANCES SO. WITH THAT I'D

02:47:58.234 --> 02:47:59.335
THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY

02:47:59.402 --> 02:48:00.637
TO BE HERE TODAY AND I'D BE

02:48:00.703 --> 02:48:02.605
HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS

THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR

02:48:05.041 --> 02:48:06.643
LIKE TO OPEN A FOR MISTER

02:48:06.709 --> 02:48:09.579
KILEY. YOUR QUESTION. I YEAH I

02:48:09.646 --> 02:48:10.613
JUST A COUPLE CONCLUDING

02:48:10.680 --> 02:48:11.748
REMARKS ON I THINK THE CHAIR

02:48:11.815 --> 02:48:13.082
AND THAT COMMITTEE FOR WHEN I

02:48:13.149 --> 02:48:13.716
WAS IN THIS AND THIS IS A VERY

02:48:13.783 --> 02:48:16.386
HELPFUL DISCUSSION- I- YOU KNOW

02:48:16.453 --> 02:48:18.188
A COUPLE TAKE AWAYS FROM ME ARE

02:48:18.254 --> 02:48:20.757
AT. I THINK THAT. ANY TALK

02:48:20.824 --> 02:48:22.392
RIGHT NOW OF THE CATEGORICAL

02:48:22.459 --> 02:48:24.994
BANNER MORATORIUM- WOULD- WIPE

02:48:25.061 --> 02:48:26.963
OUT TREMENDOUS. A SOCIAL AND

02:48:27.030 --> 02:48:29.632
ECONOMIC VALUE AND SO I WOULD

02:48:29.699 --> 02:48:31.167
NOT FAVOR THAT IN FACT I THINK

02:48:31.234 --> 02:48:31.868
THAT IF THERE ARE

02:48:31.935 --> 02:48:32.802
MUNICIPALITIES THAT ARE

02:48:32.869 --> 02:48:34.504
IMPOSING SUCH BANDS ABOUT. A

02:48:34.571 --> 02:48:36.840
RATIONAL BASIS THERE MIGHT BE A

02:48:36.906 --> 02:48:38.241
NEED FOR SOME LEVEL OF. OF

02:48:38.308 --> 02:48:40.143
UNIFORMITY BUT- AT THE SAME

02:48:40.210 --> 02:48:42.946
TIME I DON'T THINK IT'S ENOUGH.

02:48:43.012 --> 02:48:43.580
TO SAY THAT IF YOU CAN MAKE AN

02:48:43.646 --> 02:48:47.116
ANALOGY. TO AN EXISTING- HUMAN

02:48:47.183 --> 02:48:49.686
PROCESS OR IF ALL WE'RE DOING

02:48:49.752 --> 02:48:52.121
IS. ENHANCING THE CAPABILITY OF

02:48:52.188 --> 02:48:54.991
A- OF A- HUMAN PROCESS THAT

02:48:55.058 --> 02:48:56.426
THERE AREN'T DISTINCTIVE

02:48:56.493 --> 02:48:57.994
PRIVACY CONCERNS I DO THINK

02:48:58.061 --> 02:48:59.863
THAT- AT A CERTAIN POINT A

02:48:59.929 --> 02:49:01.764
DIFFERENCE OF DEGREE BECOMES. A

02:49:01.831 --> 02:49:05.702
DIFFERENCE OF. KIND FOR- SOME

02:49:05.768 --> 02:49:06.302
OF THE REASONS THAT HAVE BEEN

02:49:06.369 --> 02:49:08.071
STATED. BY HAVING TO DO WITH

02:49:08.137 --> 02:49:10.006
SCALE OR MAKING SOMETHING-

02:49:10.073 --> 02:49:11.541
SYSTEMATIC AND I THINK EVEN

02:49:11.608 --> 02:49:12.809
WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF. AN

02:49:12.876 --> 02:49:14.878
EXPECTATION OF PRIVACY- YOU

02:49:14.944 --> 02:49:15.712
KNOW WHEN IT COMES TO THE

02:49:15.778 --> 02:49:17.981
PUBLIC SURVEILLANCE ISSUE- YOU

02:49:18.047 --> 02:49:18.715
DO HAVE A REASONABLE

02:49:18.781 --> 02:49:20.483
EXPECTATION THAT SOMEONE MIGHT.

02:49:20.550 --> 02:49:22.151
SEE YOUR FACE EVEN PERHAPS

02:49:22.218 --> 02:49:23.553
SOMEONE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT WHEN

02:49:23.620 --> 02:49:25.588
YOU STEP OUTSIDE YOUR HOME- BUT

02:49:25.655 --> 02:49:26.789
PERHAPS YOU DON'T HAVE. A

02:49:26.856 --> 02:49:28.224
REASONABLE EXPECTATION THAT

02:49:28.291 --> 02:49:30.460
IT'LL BE- YOU KNOW- CAPTURED

02:49:30.527 --> 02:49:32.695
AND ANALYZED AND IDENTIFIED.

02:49:32.762 --> 02:49:35.665
AND STORES SO- I LOOK FORWARD

02:49:35.732 --> 02:49:37.534
TO WORKING WITH THE CHAIR- TO

02:49:37.600 --> 02:49:38.768
ADDRESS THESE ISSUES IN A WAY

02:49:38.835 --> 02:49:40.870
THAT- THAT YOU KNOW MAXIMIZES

02:49:40.937 --> 02:49:42.805
THE UPSIDE WILL MINIMIZING-

02:49:42.872 --> 02:49:44.641
THE- THE LEGITIMATE RISKS AND I

02:49:44.707 --> 02:49:45.942
WANT TO THANK EVERYONE FOR

02:49:46.009 --> 02:49:47.043
THEIR PARTICIPATION TODAY.

02:49:47.110 --> 02:49:50.413

OBERNOLTE. THANK YOU MISTER

02:49:51.581 --> 02:49:52.715
CHAIR OF BETTER FOR. DISCUSSION

02:49:52.782 --> 02:49:54.017
I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE FOR

02:49:54.083 --> 02:49:57.487
PARTICIPATING AT IT I MEAN. A

02:49:57.554 --> 02:49:58.388
COUPLE COMMENTS I HAVE WHAT

02:49:58.454 --> 02:49:59.455
WILL BE FIRST SAY THAT I THINK

02:49:59.522 --> 02:50:00.957
WE'RE ALL IN FURIOUS AGREEMENT

02:50:01.024 --> 02:50:02.759
THAT THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT

02:50:02.825 --> 02:50:04.027
SHOULD BE TACKLED.

02:50:04.093 --> 02:50:05.728
LEGISLATIVELY AND I ACTUALLY

02:50:05.795 --> 02:50:07.397
HAVE A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE ON

02:50:07.463 --> 02:50:09.699
WHY THAT IS- I THINK THE COURTS

02:50:09.766 --> 02:50:11.668
ARE SENDING US A SIGNAL THAT.

02:50:11.734 --> 02:50:12.902
THEY REALLY DON'T HAVE A FIRM

02:50:12.969 --> 02:50:14.170
JUDICIAL BASIS FOR TACKLING

02:50:14.237 --> 02:50:15.271
THIS SOME IN THE FOURTH

02:50:15.338 --> 02:50:16.739
AMENDMENT THE CONSTITUTION IS

02:50:16.806 --> 02:50:17.907
NOT ABOUT PRIVACY IT'S ABOUT.

02:50:17.974 --> 02:50:19.042
UNREASONABLE SEARCH AND

02:50:19.108 --> 02:50:20.443
SEIZURES AND SO YOU KNOW THE

02:50:20.510 --> 02:50:21.377
COURTS HAVE BEEN PUSHED FURTHER

02:50:21.444 --> 02:50:22.278
AND FURTHER AND FURTHER KIND OF

02:50:22.345 --> 02:50:23.913
OUT ON A LIMB THERE IN REALLY

02:50:23.980 --> 02:50:24.948
THEY'VE GONE AS FAR AS THEY CAN

02:50:25.014 --> 02:50:26.282
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT. THAT

02:50:26.349 --> 02:50:27.817
YOU KNOW IS APPROPRIATELY

02:50:27.884 --> 02:50:29.252
GOVERNED BY THE LEGISLATIVE

02:50:29.319 --> 02:50:29.953
BRANCH OF NOT THE JUDICIAL

02:50:30.019 --> 02:50:31.287
BRANCH SO I MEAN I THINK WE'RE

02:50:31.354 --> 02:50:32.622
DOING THE RIGHT THING HERE AND

02:50:32.689 --> 02:50:35.491
HAVING. THIS DISCUSSION- OVER

02:50:35.558 --> 02:50:36.693
TO WILL ALSO WANT TO TALK JUST

02:50:36.759 --> 02:50:38.328
TO TOUCH ABOUT SOMETHING WAS

02:50:38.394 --> 02:50:40.597
SAID ABOUT THE NATURE OF THAT

02:50:40.663 --> 02:50:41.164
AT A BECAUSE- I MEAN I THINK

02:50:41.230 --> 02:50:42.298
THAT. THAT'S REALLY THE CRUX

02:50:42.365 --> 02:50:44.634
OF. WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

02:50:44.701 --> 02:50:45.201
WHEN WE ARGUE ABOUT PRIVACY

02:50:45.268 --> 02:50:46.703
WHEN I TALK ABOUT DIGITAL

02:50:46.769 --> 02:50:49.138
VERSUS ANALOG. THE REASON WHY.

02:50:49.205 --> 02:50:50.273
THE COURTS HAVE RULED THAT YOU

02:50:50.340 --> 02:50:51.374
NEED A SEARCH WARRANT TO SEARCH

02:50:51.441 --> 02:50:53.042
SOMEONE'S PHONE IS BECAUSE

02:50:53.109 --> 02:50:54.110
THERE'S INFORMATION IN THERE

02:50:54.177 --> 02:50:55.745
THAT'S NOT AVAILABLE TO THE

02:50:55.812 --> 02:50:56.646
PUBLIC YOU KNOW YOU HAVE NOT

02:50:56.713 --> 02:50:59.282
DISCLOSED IT. I MEAN I CAN'T

02:50:59.349 --> 02:51:00.316
LOOK AT YOU AND KNOW WHAT YOUR

02:51:00.383 --> 02:51:01.751
SEARCH HISTORY IS ON YOUR

02:51:01.818 --> 02:51:04.420
IPHONE AND FRANKLY I DON'T WANT

02:51:04.487 --> 02:51:06.889
TO KNOW. BUT YOU KNOW BUT- YEAH

02:51:06.956 --> 02:51:07.924
AND THAT'S THE REASON WHY IT IT

02:51:07.991 --> 02:51:09.058
IT REQUIRES A WARRANT IS

02:51:09.125 --> 02:51:10.159
NOTHING TO DO WITH THE FACT

02:51:10.226 --> 02:51:11.628
THAT IT'S DIGITAL OR ITS ANALOG

02:51:11.694 --> 02:51:12.528
AND I THINK THAT THAT'S- KIND

02:51:12.595 --> 02:51:13.830
OF. AN INTERESTING THING ABOUT

02:51:13.896 --> 02:51:15.632
FACIAL RECOGNITION IS THAT WHEN

02:51:15.698 --> 02:51:16.432
YOU STEP OUTSIDE REALLY. YOUR

02:51:16.499 --> 02:51:18.067
FACE IS THERE. I MEAN IF YOU'RE

02:51:18.134 --> 02:51:19.002
HONG KONG YOU'RE GOING TO

02:51:19.068 --> 02:51:20.570
PROTEST AND YOU PUT A MASK ON.

02:51:20.637 --> 02:51:21.738
YOU'RE MAKING THE DECISION THE

02:51:21.804 --> 02:51:23.206
DECLARATION. YOU KNOW I'M NOT

02:51:23.272 --> 02:51:24.874
SHARING THAT INFORMATION OF.

02:51:24.941 --> 02:51:26.542
WHAT MY IDENTITY IS. AND IF YOU

02:51:26.609 --> 02:51:27.744
WALK OUTSIDE WITHOUT A MASK

02:51:27.810 --> 02:51:29.212
IT'S AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THAT.

02:51:29.278 --> 02:51:30.613
THAT YES SOMEONE MIGHT LOOK AT

02:51:30.680 --> 02:51:32.215
ME AND RECOGNIZE ME AND I MEAN

02:51:32.281 --> 02:51:33.850
I THINK THAT THAT'S- YOU KNOW

02:51:33.916 --> 02:51:34.317
THAT THAT'S A FUN. THE

02:51:34.384 --> 02:51:36.386
FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE. I ALSO

02:51:36.452 --> 02:51:38.054
ONE OF VEHEMENTLY DISAGREE WITH

02:51:38.121 --> 02:51:38.755
SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN A SET A

02:51:38.821 --> 02:51:40.523
COUPLE OF TIMES. I BELIEVE IT

02:51:40.590 --> 02:51:41.791
WAS ON THIS PANEL. WHICH IS

02:51:41.858 --> 02:51:44.060
THAT. THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE

02:51:44.127 --> 02:51:45.194
CRIME SHOULD BE ONE OF THE

02:51:45.261 --> 02:51:46.429
THINGS THAT DISTINGUISHES

02:51:46.496 --> 02:51:48.264
WHETHER NOT FACIAL RECOGNITION.

02:51:48.331 --> 02:51:49.666
TECHNOLOGY IS APPROPRIATE. I

02:51:49.732 --> 02:51:51.668
VERY MUCH DISAGREE WITH THAT. I

02:51:51.734 --> 02:51:53.469
MEAN IF YOU ASK THE AVERAGE.

02:51:53.536 --> 02:51:56.239
CONSTITUENT OF OURS. WHETHER OR

02:51:56.305 --> 02:51:57.840
NOT. THEY THINK. THAT THEY

02:51:57.907 --> 02:52:00.977
SHOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE THEIR

02:52:01.044 --> 02:52:03.746
THEIR THEIR DOOR CAM. FOOTAGE

02:52:03.813 --> 02:52:05.148
WHEN SOMEONE STEALS AN AMAZON

02:52:05.214 --> 02:52:06.949
PACKAGE OFF OF THEIR PORCH. AND

02:52:07.016 --> 02:52:08.217
GIVE THAT TO LAW ENFORCEMENT SO

02:52:08.284 --> 02:52:09.719
THEY CAN IDENTIFY WHO DID IT.

02:52:09.786 --> 02:52:11.020
AND PREVENT IT FROM HAPPENING

02:52:11.087 --> 02:52:12.155
FROM SOMEONE TO SOMEONE ELSE.

02:52:12.221 --> 02:52:14.824
YOU KNOW. 99% OF PEOPLE WILL

02:52:14.891 --> 02:52:17.093
SAY YES. OKAY THAT'S THAT'S

02:52:17.160 --> 02:52:20.196
REALLY ON THE LEAST SERIOUS.

02:52:20.263 --> 02:52:20.697
AXIS OF THE WHOLE CRIME

02:52:20.763 --> 02:52:21.798
SPECTRUM RIGHT. SO I MEAN I

02:52:21.864 --> 02:52:23.032
REALLY I REALLY THINK THAT IT'S

02:52:23.099 --> 02:52:24.534
IMPORTANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT.

02:52:24.600 --> 02:52:25.468
THAT YOU KNOW THERE'S SOCIETAL

02:52:25.535 --> 02:52:26.803
BENEFITS THAT. COME FROM THIS

02:52:26.869 --> 02:52:28.404
THAT. DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO

02:52:28.471 --> 02:52:30.239
WITH SERIOUSNESS OF CRIME. BOB

02:52:30.306 --> 02:52:32.041
AND I ALSO WISH. AND THIS IS

02:52:32.108 --> 02:52:33.476
PROBABLY IF YOU'LL HOLD BUT I

02:52:33.543 --> 02:52:34.877
MEAN I WISH WE COULD DIVORCE.

02:52:34.944 --> 02:52:36.979
THIS KIND OF PHILOSOPHICAL

02:52:37.046 --> 02:52:38.948
DISCUSSION OF THIS ISSUE FROM.

02:52:39.015 --> 02:52:40.183
SOME OF THE VERY EMOTIONAL

02:52:40.249 --> 02:52:41.517
TOPICS THAT WE WRESTLE WITH AS

02:52:41.584 --> 02:52:43.352
A SOCIETY. AND BIASES A GREAT

02:52:43.419 --> 02:52:44.721
EXAMPLE. YOU KNOW WHEN WE SAY

02:52:44.787 --> 02:52:46.289
BYPASS. I MEAN I THINK THAT

02:52:46.355 --> 02:52:48.257
CONFLATES. AN EMOTIONAL BY US

02:52:48.324 --> 02:52:49.726
ON THE SENSE IN THE SENSE OF A

02:52:49.792 --> 02:52:53.696
PERSON. YOU KNOW WITH. A IRAQ

02:52:53.763 --> 02:52:55.164
AN INACCURACY FOR AN ALGORITHM

02:52:55.231 --> 02:52:56.265
RIGHT OR IT'S NOT FAIR TO SAY

02:52:56.332 --> 02:52:57.834
THAT THE ALGORITHM IS BIASED.

02:52:57.900 --> 02:52:59.001
WE CAN SAY THAT THE ALGORITHM

02:52:59.068 --> 02:53:02.939
HAS A DIFFERENT- SUCCESS RATE.

02:53:03.005 --> 02:53:03.573
FOR PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT

02:53:03.639 --> 02:53:05.241
ETHNICITIES THAT BE CORRECT NOT

02:53:05.308 --> 02:53:06.209
SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO HAVE

02:53:06.275 --> 02:53:07.110
KNOWLEDGE. AND WE NEED TO WORK

02:53:07.176 --> 02:53:09.178
ON. BUT IT'S AN IMPROVEMENT

02:53:09.245 --> 02:53:11.547
OVER. OUR WHAT WE HAD IN THE

02:53:11.614 --> 02:53:12.148
PAST WHICH IS KIND OF

02:53:12.215 --> 02:53:14.984
UNACKNOWLEDGED. HUMAN BY US.

02:53:15.051 --> 02:53:16.352
RIGHT SO IT'S ACTUALLY BY BY

02:53:16.419 --> 02:53:17.587
HAVING AN ALGORITHM DO IT AS

02:53:17.653 --> 02:53:19.155
LONG AS WE'RE CAREFUL ABOUT IT

02:53:19.222 --> 02:53:21.124
WE'RE ACTUALLY MOVING. IN THE

02:53:21.190 --> 02:53:23.326
RIGHT DIRECTION. I SAW IT I

02:53:23.392 --> 02:53:25.595
THINK GOINGON HERE. IT'S BEEN

02:53:25.661 --> 02:53:26.195
SAID A COUPLE TIMES IN THIS

02:53:26.262 --> 02:53:27.764
ROOM TODAY THAT. FACIAL

02:53:27.830 --> 02:53:28.831
RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY

02:53:28.898 --> 02:53:30.066
THREATENS THE SAFETY OF

02:53:30.133 --> 02:53:32.201
IMMIGRANT. COMMUNITIES RIGHT

02:53:32.268 --> 02:53:33.035
BUT WHAT WHAT WE'RE TALKING

02:53:33.102 --> 02:53:35.371
ABOUT NOW HERE. IS NOT. THE

02:53:35.438 --> 02:53:36.606
ALGORITHM WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A

02:53:36.672 --> 02:53:38.508
DISAGREEMENT OVER FEDERAL

02:53:38.574 --> 02:53:39.542
IMMIGRATION LAW AND WHAT SHOULD

02:53:39.609 --> 02:53:40.777
BE ENFORCEABLE WHAT SHOULDN'T

02:53:40.843 --> 02:53:42.979
BE THAT'S- THAT'S A COMPLETELY

02:53:43.045 --> 02:53:44.247
DIFFERENT TOPIC. THE SOLVING OF

02:53:44.313 --> 02:53:47.083
FINALLY JUDGE THINK. ARE AGREE

02:53:47.150 --> 02:53:49.752
WITH MR KILEY ABOUT THE FACT

02:53:49.819 --> 02:53:51.954
THAT IT. OFFICIAL RECOGNITION

02:53:52.021 --> 02:53:53.589
TECHNOLOGY HAS A LOT OF

02:53:53.656 --> 02:53:55.658
BENEFICIAL USES YEAH I THINK

02:53:55.725 --> 02:53:56.893
IT'S IMPORTANT I MEAN FIRST OF

02:53:56.959 --> 02:53:57.860
FIRST OF ALL I THINK IT'S A

02:53:57.927 --> 02:53:59.061
VERY IMPORTANT FOR US NOT TO

02:53:59.128 --> 02:54:01.063
POINT ON THIS ISSUE IN PASSING

02:54:01.130 --> 02:54:02.765
A MORATORIUM WOULD BE PROJECT.

02:54:02.832 --> 02:54:03.833
RIGHT WERE SAY ONE TO THROW THE

02:54:03.900 --> 02:54:05.134
BABY OUT WITH THE BATH WATER

02:54:05.201 --> 02:54:06.936
AND SAY YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE

02:54:07.003 --> 02:54:07.837
GOING TO DISALLOW ALL THE

02:54:07.904 --> 02:54:09.438
BENEFICIAL USES AS WELL AS THAT

02:54:09.505 --> 02:54:11.474
IS THE NON BENEFICIAL USES I

02:54:11.541 --> 02:54:12.942
THINK INSTEAD WE NEED TO DO A

02:54:13.009 --> 02:54:14.744
VERY CAREFUL AND STUDIED

02:54:14.811 --> 02:54:17.280
ANALYSIS OF. HOW THIS

02:54:17.346 --> 02:54:19.215
TECHNOLOGY COULD BE ABUSED AND

02:54:19.282 --> 02:54:20.016
I MEAN IF YOU GO OUT ON THE

02:54:20.082 --> 02:54:21.684
LONG AXIS OF ABUSE RIGHT HOW

02:54:21.751 --> 02:54:23.252
COULD IT BE ABUSED WELL IF THE

02:54:23.319 --> 02:54:26.189
GOVERNMENT NEW. EVERY TIME-SOMEONE WENT INTO A PUBLIC

02:54:26.255 --> 02:54:27.657
PLACE EXACTLY WHO THEY WERE AND

02:54:27.723 --> 02:54:29.492
WHERE THEY WENT IF THAT RECORD

02:54:29.559 --> 02:54:30.993
WAS AVAILABLE ON A CONTINUAL

02:54:31.060 --> 02:54:32.595
BASIS YOU KNOW THROUGH ALL OF

02:54:32.662 --> 02:54:34.397
THE YEARS OF SOMEONE'S LIFE THE

02:54:34.463 --> 02:54:35.965
GOVERNMENT COULD USE THAT TO

02:54:36.032 --> 02:54:38.267
IDENTIFY DISSIDENTS- TO STIFLE

02:54:38.334 --> 02:54:39.869
FREE SPEECH IN WAYS THAT HAVE

02:54:39.936 --> 02:54:41.037
DONE BEEN DONE ELSEWHERE IN

02:54:41.103 --> 02:54:43.606
HUMAN HISTORY BY AUTHORITARIAN

02:54:43.673 --> 02:54:44.407
REGIMES. THAT'S TERRIFYING

02:54:44.473 --> 02:54:45.675
RIGHT THAT IS WHAT TRYING TO

02:54:45.741 --> 02:54:48.644
AVOID HERE. OKAY BUT TO SAY

02:54:48.711 --> 02:54:50.479
WE'RE GOING TO BAN FACIAL REST

02:54:50.546 --> 02:54:51.714
RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY ALL

02:54:51.781 --> 02:54:52.782
TOGETHER BECAUSE WE'RE AFRAID

02:54:52.849 --> 02:54:54.750
OF THAT OUTCOME IS LIKE SAYING

02:54:54.817 --> 02:54:56.052
THAT WE'RE GOING TO WE'RE

02:54:56.118 --> 02:54:57.854
AFRAID THAT PEOPLE OCCASIONALLY

02:54:57.920 --> 02:54:58.855
WE'LL GET INTO FATAL CAR

02:54:58.921 --> 02:54:59.989
ACCIDENT AND SO WE'RE GOING TO

02:55:00.056 --> 02:55:01.390
PREVENT ANYONE FOR PRIVATE CAR

02:55:01.457 --> 02:55:02.592
RIDES IT EXHIBIT BRUTICUS

02:55:02.658 --> 02:55:03.926
EXAMPLE BUT ESSENTIALLY

02:55:03.993 --> 02:55:05.228
PHILOSOPHICALLY THAT'S WHAT

02:55:05.294 --> 02:55:06.329
WE'RE DOING. INSTEAD I THINK WE

02:55:06.395 --> 02:55:10.766
NEED TO FOCUS ON HOW THE USES

02:55:10.833 --> 02:55:11.434
OF THIS TECHNOLOGY CAN GO WRONG.

02:55:11.500 --> 02:55:13.102
AND PREVENT. THE GOVERNMENT USE

02:55:13.169 --> 02:55:14.837
OF THAT TECHNOLOGY IN WAYS.

02:55:14.904 --> 02:55:16.906
THAT THAT THAT LEAD TOWARDS

02:55:16.973 --> 02:55:18.307
THOSE OUTCOMES. RIGHT THAT'S

02:55:18.374 --> 02:55:19.742
WHAT WE NEED TO BE DOING HERE

02:55:19.809 --> 02:55:20.643
AND IT'S GONNA TAKE A LOT OF

02:55:20.710 --> 02:55:21.577
TIME IT'S GOING TO TAKE

02:55:21.644 --> 02:55:23.279
ENGAGEMENT BY. ALL OF US ARE

02:55:23.346 --> 02:55:24.347
ALL OUR VARIOUS USER

02:55:24.413 --> 02:55:25.915
COMMUNITIES- AND IT'S GOING TO

02:55:25.982 --> 02:55:28.784
TAKE- Y'ALL A LOT OF HEARINGS.

02:55:28.851 --> 02:55:29.385
AND A LOT OF DELIBERATION BUT

02:55:29.452 --> 02:55:31.153
THAT'S WHERE WE NEED TO GO. SO

02:55:31.220 --> 02:55:32.555
ARE YOU KNOW TO THAT AND MISTER

02:55:32.622 --> 02:55:33.623
CHAIRMAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH

02:55:33.689 --> 02:55:34.991
FOR CONVENE HEARING- THIS IS

02:55:35.057 --> 02:55:36.092
EXACTLY THE KIND OF DIALOGUE

02:55:36.158 --> 02:55:37.460
THAT WE NEED TO BE HAVE. HAVING

02:55:37.526 --> 02:55:38.361
ON THIS TOPIC AS WE MOVE

02:55:38.427 --> 02:55:40.096
FORWARD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH

02:55:40.162 --> 02:55:41.364
FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND-

02:55:41.430 --> 02:55:43.132
INDENTURES OF TIME I I'M GONNA.

02:55:43.199 --> 02:55:45.034
JUST THERE PROBABLY CONCLUDE.

02:55:45.101 --> 02:55:46.135
BY THANKING ALL OF YOU FOR

02:55:46.202 --> 02:55:47.737

03:00:53.175 --> 03:00:56.412
A LITTLE SHORTER ALL RIGHT ERIC

03:00:56.478 --> 03:00:58.147
SABATINI ON THE CALEDON MANAGER

03:00:58.214 --> 03:01:00.316
FOR LACK CHRIS LOS ANGELES

03:01:00.382 --> 03:01:02.585
COUNTY SO- I ALSO HAD A FOUR

03:01:02.651 --> 03:01:04.620
MINUTE SPIEL AND I'M GONNA CUT

03:01:04.687 --> 03:01:06.422
IT DOWN JUST AS LIKE A BUNCH OF

03:01:06.488 --> 03:01:09.925
QUESTIONS- ONE THING I THINK

03:01:09.992 --> 03:01:11.894
THAT REALLY NEEDS TO BE.

03:01:11.961 --> 03:01:14.230
CLARIFIED IS THE USE FOR

03:01:14.296 --> 03:01:15.464
SURVEILLANCE AND THE USE AND

03:01:15.531 --> 03:01:18.300
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS TWO

03:01:18.367 --> 03:01:18.867
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THINGS

03:01:18.934 --> 03:01:19.635
FISH RECOGNITION IS NOT

03:01:19.702 --> 03:01:21.370
SURVEILLANCE IT'S A TOOL THAT

03:01:21.437 --> 03:01:23.405
CAN BE USED IN SURVEILLANCE.

03:01:23.472 --> 03:01:24.707
BUT IT IS NOT SURVEILLANCE IN

03:01:24.773 --> 03:01:26.609
ITSELF I THINK THAT WAS ONE OF

03:01:26.675 --> 03:01:27.543
THE THINGS IS KIND OF MUDDY THE

03:01:27.610 --> 03:01:29.178
WATER A LITTLE BIT. THE OTHER

03:01:29.245 --> 03:01:31.113
THING IS FACE RECOGNITION IS

03:01:31.180 --> 03:01:32.681
NOT SOMETHING NEW. IT'S NOT

03:01:32.748 --> 03:01:33.415
SOMETHING NEW IN LAW

03:01:33.482 --> 03:01:36.218
ENFORCEMENT AND IT'S BEEN PART

03:01:36.285 --> 03:01:37.553
OF A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION

03:01:37.620 --> 03:01:39.588
SENSE IF YOU WANT TO GO BACK TO

03:01:39.655 --> 03:01:40.589
ORGANICALLY TILL THE WANTED

03:01:40.656 --> 03:01:43.892
POSTER. RIGHT THE BOTTOM LINE

03:01:43.959 --> 03:01:47.529
IS THAT SOMEONE NEEDS TO BE A-

03:01:47.596 --> 03:01:48.264
THE SUSPECT HAS TO BE

03:01:48.330 --> 03:01:50.065
IDENTIFIED IN COURT. IT IS

03:01:50.132 --> 03:01:51.300
PROBABLE CAUSE THROUGH THE

03:01:51.367 --> 03:01:53.002
INVESTIGATION THAT IDENTIFIES

03:01:53.068 --> 03:01:55.170
AN INDIVIDUAL IS NOT A MACHINE

03:01:55.237 --> 03:01:56.538
OR DEVICE THAT SPITS OUT A

03:01:56.605 --> 03:01:57.973
PICTURE. AND SAYS THIS IS YOUR

03:01:58.040 --> 03:02:00.476
GUY GO ARREST THEM. SO I THINK

03:02:00.542 --> 03:02:01.977
