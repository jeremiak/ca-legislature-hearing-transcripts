00:38:39.617 --> 00:38:42.520
I THE HISTORY MOSTLY HAS BEEN

00:38:42.586 --> 00:38:43.487
ANECDOTAL.

00:38:43.554 --> 00:38:45.523
OF FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS

00:38:45.589 --> 00:38:46.757

00:38:46.824 --> 00:38:48.526

00:38:48.592 --> 00:38:49.860

00:38:52.296 --> 00:38:54.832
THAT THEY WERE VOTER PROBABLY

00:38:54.899 --> 00:38:55.900
WANTED TO REGISTER INDEPENDENT.

00:38:55.966 --> 00:38:57.334
AND AS WE BROUGHT THIS ISSUE UP

00:38:57.401 --> 00:38:58.969
THE FEEDBACK WE ALWAYS RECEIVED

00:38:59.036 --> 00:39:00.071

AS MANY AS VOTERS AS WE COULD

00:39:15.686 --> 00:39:17.021
FROM THAT POLITICAL PARTY TO TRY

00:39:17.088 --> 00:39:18.856
TO IDENTIFY NOT JUST POLICY

00:39:18.923 --> 00:39:20.391
STANCES BUT WHETHER THEY COULD

00:39:20.458 --> 00:39:21.425
IDENTIFY THEIR POLITICAL PARTY

00:39:21.492 --> 00:39:24.762

ASKED WHAT IS YOUR POLITICAL

REGISTERED AMERICAN INDEPENDENT.

00:40:21.085 --> 00:40:22.787
I SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAS

00:40:22.853 --> 00:40:24.421
CONTINUED EVEN THOUGH WE'VE

00:40:24.488 --> 00:40:26.290
SHOWN A LIGHT ON IT WITH THE LA

00:40:26.357 --> 00:40:27.625
TIMES.

00:40:27.691 --> 00:40:28.292
IT'S SOMETHING THAT HAS

00:40:28.359 --> 00:40:31.328
CONTINUED I YOU KNOW EVEN AS

00:40:31.395 --> 00:40:32.830
THEIR OF AN ACTIVE CAMPAIGNS AND

00:40:32.897 --> 00:40:35.699
EFFORTS TO TRY TO INFORM VOTERS --

00:40:35.766 --> 00:40:37.401
AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT AT THIS

00:40:37.468 --> 00:40:39.637
POINT I BELIEVE TALKING WITH THE

00:40:39.703 --> 00:40:40.604
SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE AND

00:40:40.671 --> 00:40:41.705
WITH LEGISLATORS.

00:40:41.772 --> 00:40:42.473
THERE'S REALLY NO OTHER

00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:44.275
APPROPRIATE REMEDY TO TRY TO

00:40:44.341 --> 00:40:45.309
RESOLVE THIS.

00:40:45.376 --> 00:40:46.510
IT DOES BRING UP IN THE

00:40:46.577 --> 00:40:48.312
COMMITTEE ANALYSIS SOME CONCERNS

00:40:48.379 --> 00:40:49.346
ABOUT.

00:40:49.413 --> 00:40:50.481
THE ISSUE OF IS THERE A

00:40:50.548 --> 00:40:52.283
COMPELLING STATE INTEREST AND MY

00:40:52.349 --> 00:40:54.819
ARGUMENT IS THAT VOTER INTENT IS

00:40:54.885 --> 00:40:55.953
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT

00:40:56.020 --> 00:40:58.022
YOU AS A COMMITTEE OR THE STATE

00:40:58.088 --> 00:40:59.924
AND MINISTERING ELECTIONS CAN.

00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:01.492
HOLD ON TO IS VOTER INTENT AND

00:41:01.559 --> 00:41:03.294
THERE'S CLEAR VOTER INTENT HERE

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:04.995
FOR PEOPLE TO REGISTER AN

00:41:05.062 --> 00:41:06.864
AFFILIATE WITHOUT BEING A PART

00:41:06.931 --> 00:41:08.833
OF A POLITICAL PARTY BEING

00:41:08.899 --> 00:41:09.333
INDEPENDENT OR NO PARTY

00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:10.501
PREFERENCE.

00:41:10.568 --> 00:41:11.502
THE SECOND ISSUE IS FREEDOM OF

00:41:11.569 --> 00:41:13.337
ASSOCIATION.

00:41:13.404 --> 00:41:14.705
AND I WOULD ARGUE THAT FREEDOM

00:41:14.772 --> 00:41:16.540
OF ASSOCIATION DOESN'T COUNT IF

00:41:16.607 --> 00:41:18.709
YOU'RE BEING MISLED OR TRACTOR

00:41:18.776 --> 00:41:20.578
UNAWARE OF WHAT YOUR ASSOCIATING

00:41:20.644 --> 00:41:21.478
WITH.

00:41:21.545 --> 00:41:23.447
AND WE HAVE A LOT OF EVIDENCE

00:41:23.514 --> 00:41:25.082
AND CONTINUE TO BUILD EVIDENCE

00:41:25.149 --> 00:41:26.383
TO SHOW THAT PEOPLE REGISTERED

00:41:26.450 --> 00:41:27.651
AMERICAN INDEPENDENT.

00:41:27.718 --> 00:41:29.286
ARE NOT INTENDING TO BE A PART

00:41:29.353 --> 00:41:31.589
OF THIS POLITICAL PARTY I AM BE

00:41:31.655 --> 00:41:33.224
AFFILIATED WITH IT -- THEY ARE

00:41:33.290 --> 00:41:35.459
CHOOSING TO BE NO PARTY

00:41:35.526 --> 00:41:36.861
PREFERENCE AND I ALSO WANT TO BE

00:41:36.927 --> 00:41:38.195
DOWN ONE RUMOR.

00:41:38.262 --> 00:41:39.530
THAT IS THAT THIS IS SOMETHING

00:41:39.597 --> 00:41:40.564
THAT JUST HAPPENS TO LOW

00:41:40.631 --> 00:41:41.832
INFORMATION VOTERS.

00:41:41.899 --> 00:41:43.801
PEOPLE WHO JUST DON'T GET IT

00:41:43.868 --> 00:41:44.401
ACCIDENTALLY GET TRICKED INTO

00:41:44.468 --> 00:41:47.504
THIS -- THERE ARE TWO FAMILY

00:41:47.571 --> 00:41:49.306

00:41:49.373 --> 00:41:51.108
STATE LEGISLATORS WHO BEEN

00:41:52.476 --> 00:41:53.611
THERE IS STAFF MEMBER THE

00:41:53.677 --> 00:41:55.412
SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE AND

00:41:55.479 --> 00:41:56.614
THERE IS A MEMBER OF THIS

00:41:56.680 --> 00:41:57.815
CURRENT ADMINISTRATION.

00:41:57.882 --> 00:41:58.816
THAT HAVE BEEN REGISTERED

00:41:58.883 --> 00:42:00.451
AMERICAN INDEPENDENT INCORRECTLY.

00:42:00.517 --> 00:42:02.820
SOME VERY VERY VERY ENGAGED AND

00:42:02.887 --> 00:42:04.154
IN A COUPLE CASES ELECTED

00:42:04.221 --> 00:42:06.056
OFFICIALS WHO DID NOT KNOW THAT

00:42:06.123 --> 00:42:07.458
THEY HAD INADVERTENTLY

00:42:07.524 --> 00:42:09.126
REGISTERED WITH A POLITICAL

00:42:09.193 --> 00:42:10.527

AND AS WE GO TOWARDS THE PRIMARY

00:42:16.367 --> 00:42:17.601
WE START TO SEE WHERE THIS

00:42:17.668 --> 00:42:20.905
REALLY HAS AN ACT AN ACUTE HARM.

00:42:20.971 --> 00:42:21.839

COLLEAGUES FOR QUESTIONS OR

00:52:59.142 --> 00:53:01.778

DOWN TO A DISAPPEAR

00:53:06.683 --> 00:53:09.986
CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUE -- THIS IS

00:53:10.053 --> 00:53:11.388
A PARTY THAT'S HAD THAT NAME

00:53:11.454 --> 00:53:15.058
SINCE AS I UNDERSTAND IT.

00:53:15.125 --> 00:53:15.692
NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT THERE IS IT

00:53:15.759 --> 00:53:17.327
THAT THE FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION

00:53:17.394 --> 00:53:19.996
ISSUE IS IS ONE OF THE PARTIES.

00:53:20.063 --> 00:53:21.398
AND THE ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO

00:53:21.464 --> 00:53:22.933
HAVE THE NAME THAT THEY'VE HAD

00:53:22.999 --> 00:53:27.003
FOR THE LAST. FIFTY PLUS YEARS --

00:53:27.070 --> 00:53:29.706
AND FOR US TO COME IN AND SAY

00:53:29.773 --> 00:53:31.241

CHANGE THEIR NAME YOU KNOW THE

00:53:36.580 --> 00:53:38.048
YOU KIND OF IT SEEMS LIKE PEOPLE

00:53:38.114 --> 00:53:39.316
KIND OF CUT AROUND THE EDGES

00:53:39.382 --> 00:53:40.717
THIS YES FIRST YOU WOULD NEED A

00:53:40.784 --> 00:53:42.085
COMPELLING STATE INTEREST TO DO

00:53:42.152 --> 00:53:43.720
SO BECAUSE IT WOULD CLEARLY BE A

00:53:43.787 --> 00:53:45.488
FIRST AMENDMENT ISSUE.

00:53:45.555 --> 00:53:46.556
YOU NEED A COMPELLING STATE

00:53:46.623 --> 00:53:47.757
INTEREST IN HOW TO BE NARROWLY

00:53:47.824 --> 00:53:50.560
TAILORED. TO ACCOMPLISH THE

00:53:50.627 --> 00:53:51.661
PURPOSE.

00:53:51.728 --> 00:53:53.229
AND HERE I I DON'T KNOW THAT A

00:53:53.296 --> 00:53:54.297
COMPELLING STATE INTEREST IS

00:53:54.364 --> 00:53:57.000
THAT BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE CONFUSED.

00:53:57.067 --> 00:53:58.702
AND ANYBODY COULD READ THEIR

00:53:58.768 --> 00:54:00.236
PLATFORM ANYBODY COULD GO ON AND

00:54:00.303 --> 00:54:01.871
LOOK AND SEE WHAT THEIR PARTY IS

00:54:01.938 --> 00:54:03.239
ABOUT AND DECIDE WHETHER NOT TO

00:54:03.306 --> 00:54:05.675
BE PART OF THE AMERICAN

00:54:05.742 --> 00:54:08.411
INDEPENDENT PARTY OR NOT -- THE

00:54:08.478 --> 00:54:11.648
FACT THAT OUR ELECTORATE.

00:54:11.715 --> 00:54:13.883
YOU KNOW MAY NOT UNDERSTAND.

00:54:13.950 --> 00:54:14.784
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'RE VOTING FOR

00:54:14.851 --> 00:54:17.554
I MEAN AT I THINK THERE'S PEOPLE

00:54:17.621 --> 00:54:18.188
AROUND THIS ROOM WHO WOULD ARGUE

00:54:18.254 --> 00:54:19.155
THAT.

00:54:19.222 --> 00:54:20.490
YOU KNOW.

00:54:20.557 --> 00:54:22.225
PEOPLE MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT

00:54:22.292 --> 00:54:23.927
ELECTIONS ALL THE TIME THAT ARE

00:54:23.994 --> 00:54:29.532
NOT NECESSARILY -- WELL INFORMED.

00:54:29.599 --> 00:54:33.803
IF YOU WILL -- BUT I DON'T KNOW

00:54:33.870 --> 00:54:35.438
THERE'S A COMPELLING STATE

00:54:35.505 --> 00:54:36.906
INTEREST AGO FORCE THEM.

00:54:36.973 --> 00:54:39.175
YOU KNOW -- TO TO CHANGE OF A

00:54:39.242 --> 00:54:41.177
PARTY NAME TO DO SO -- AND THEN

00:54:41.244 --> 00:54:42.045
YOU HAVE TO BE NARAL NARROWLY

00:54:42.112 --> 00:54:43.380
TAILORED I MEAN IF YOU WANTED TO

00:54:43.446 --> 00:54:44.681
GET OUT THAT ISSUE OF VOTER

00:54:44.748 --> 00:54:45.815
CONFUSION.

00:54:45.882 --> 00:54:47.350
THE STATE HAS RESOURCES TO

00:54:47.417 --> 00:54:49.252
EDUCATE PEOPLE IN FACT WE HAVE A

00:54:49.319 --> 00:54:50.253
BILL.

00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:51.988
MOVING THROUGH THIS LEGISLATURE

00:54:52.055 --> 00:54:53.490
RIGHT NOW THAT WOULD REQUIRE

00:54:53.556 --> 00:54:55.925
THREE NOTICES TO GO OUT -- TO

00:54:55.992 --> 00:54:58.294
VOTERS BEFORE -- BEFORE THE

00:54:58.361 --> 00:55:00.997
PRIMARY ELECTION I BELIEVE IT IS --

00:55:01.064 --> 00:55:02.399
JUST SO DON'T KNOW HEY ARE YOU

00:55:02.465 --> 00:55:04.200
SURE THIS IS THE PARTY YOU WANT

00:55:04.267 --> 00:55:06.236
TO BE REGISTERED WITH -- AND AND

00:55:06.302 --> 00:55:08.204
AND ALSO TO KNOW A IF YOU WANT

00:55:08.271 --> 00:55:08.705
IT WOULD.

00:55:08.772 --> 00:55:10.407
BE A A TRUE INDEPENDENT AND BILL

00:55:10.473 --> 00:55:12.275
IN THE DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY FOR

00:55:12.342 --> 00:55:14.444
INSTANCE -- YOU KNOW SO THAT THE

00:55:14.511 --> 00:55:16.246
STATE HAS ITS OWN RESOURCES TO

00:55:16.312 --> 00:55:17.714
GET INFORMATION OUT THERE TO

00:55:17.781 --> 00:55:21.084
VOTERS WHO MIGHT BE CONFUSED --

00:55:21.151 --> 00:55:23.620
AND THAT WOULD BE A MUCH LESS.

00:55:23.687 --> 00:55:25.155
THAT WOULD BE A MORE NARROWLY

00:55:25.221 --> 00:55:26.723
TAILORED WAY OF GETTING OUT THAT

00:55:26.790 --> 00:55:29.125
PURPOSE THEN MAKING A PARTY

00:55:29.192 --> 00:55:31.194
THAT'S EXISTED FOR OVER FIFTY

00:55:31.261 --> 00:55:32.595
YEARS CHANGE ITS NAME -- AND SO

00:55:32.662 --> 00:55:34.397
I MEAN I THINK.

00:55:34.464 --> 00:55:35.498
EVEN IF YOU'RE ABLE TO GET THIS

00:55:35.565 --> 00:55:37.434
BILL PASSED IT'S GONNA GET

00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:39.269
STRUCK DOWN BY THE COURTS.

00:55:39.335 --> 00:55:41.471
AND TO ME I JUST.

00:55:41.538 --> 00:55:43.006
I THINK THERE'S OTHER THINGS WE

00:55:43.073 --> 00:55:44.974
COULD DO TO HELP BETTER EDUCATE.

00:55:45.041 --> 00:55:47.243
THE THE THE VOTING PUBLIC AND

00:55:47.310 --> 00:55:48.478
THAT'S KIND OF LARGE HOUSE LOOK

00:55:48.545 --> 00:55:50.080
AS NOT ANSWER THE GOVERNMENT'S

00:55:50.146 --> 00:55:51.181
JOB TO DO.

00:55:51.247 --> 00:55:53.149
IT'S I THINK ALL OF OUR JOBS TO

00:55:53.216 --> 00:55:54.751
DO IS TO HELP EDUCATE PEOPLE

00:55:54.818 --> 00:55:55.752
ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THEIR

00:55:55.819 --> 00:55:57.487
GOVERNMENT THAT'S PART OF WHAT I

00:55:57.554 --> 00:55:59.055
DO AS A REPRESENTATIVE.

00:55:59.122 --> 00:56:00.290
I THINK EVERYBODY AROUND THIS

00:56:00.356 --> 00:56:02.025
TABLE DOES THAT -- BUT THIS JUST

00:56:02.092 --> 00:56:05.462
SEEMS LIKE A VERY DRASTIC

00:56:05.528 --> 00:56:05.762
[inaudible]

00:56:05.829 --> 00:56:10.066
AND AT USING A HAMMER -- WHEN

00:56:10.133 --> 00:56:11.701
YOU COULD USE A SCALPEL --

00:56:11.768 --> 00:56:13.136
APPROACH.

00:56:13.203 --> 00:56:14.637
BUT I UNDERSTAND THE THE REASON

00:56:14.704 --> 00:56:16.573
BEHIND IT AND THE MOTIVATION

00:56:16.639 --> 00:56:17.841
BEHIND IT.

00:56:17.907 --> 00:56:19.375
THE MEN'S RESTROOM IS.

00:56:19.442 --> 00:56:21.377
I THANK YOU SENATOR -- FOR FOR

00:56:21.444 --> 00:56:23.113
BRING THIS FORWARD -- I KNOW

00:56:23.179 --> 00:56:25.982
THAT.

00:56:26.049 --> 00:56:26.950
AT LEAST ON OUR SIDE THERE IS --

00:56:27.016 --> 00:56:28.485
RECOMMENDATION IS IS AN

00:56:28.551 --> 00:56:30.320
OPPOSITION BUT I I UNDERSTAND

00:56:30.386 --> 00:56:32.856
THE NEED -- FOR IT BECAUSE OF

00:56:32.922 --> 00:56:34.724
THERE CERTAINLY IS NO DOUBT --

00:56:34.791 --> 00:56:37.393
THAT OF VOTERS ARE CONFUSED WHEN

00:56:37.460 --> 00:56:38.428
THEY'RE REGISTERING TO VOTE AND

00:56:38.495 --> 00:56:40.063
A RIP BUT THEN THEY AND WHEN

00:56:40.130 --> 00:56:42.332
THEY REGISTER THAT THEY OFTEN

00:56:42.398 --> 00:56:43.967
TIMES -- THEY WANT TO BE

00:56:44.033 --> 00:56:45.401
INDEPENDENT AND SO THEY GO TO

00:56:45.468 --> 00:56:47.370
THE AMERICAN INDEPENDENT PARTY --

00:56:47.437 --> 00:56:50.640
THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT --

00:56:50.707 --> 00:56:51.641
THERE'S THE REALLY THREE WORDS

00:56:51.708 --> 00:56:53.910
AND AN AMERICAN -- POLITICAL

00:56:53.977 --> 00:56:56.012
LEXICON IT'S YOUR DEMOCRATS YOUR

00:56:56.079 --> 00:56:57.247
REPUBLICAN OR YOU'RE NEITHER OF

00:56:57.313 --> 00:56:58.414
THEM YOU'RE AN INDEPENDENT AND

00:56:58.481 --> 00:56:59.415
OF COURSE THERE'S THE GREEN

00:56:59.482 --> 00:57:01.885
PARTY LIBERTARIAN PARTY.

00:57:01.951 --> 00:57:02.418
BUT WHEN PEOPLE THINK THAT

00:57:02.485 --> 00:57:03.753
THEY'RE INDEPENDENT.

00:57:03.820 --> 00:57:04.521
MAYBE THEY'RE INDEPENDENT SO

00:57:04.587 --> 00:57:05.321
THEY'RE GOING TO REGISTER TO

00:57:05.388 --> 00:57:06.589
VOTE AND THEY GO DOWN THE THE

00:57:06.656 --> 00:57:08.792
LIST OF OPTIONS THEY DON'T LOOK

00:57:08.858 --> 00:57:10.794
IT NO PARTY PREFERENCE THEY

00:57:10.860 --> 00:57:12.295
DON'T LOOK AT DECLINE TO STATE.

00:57:12.362 --> 00:57:13.263
BILL ACCORDS INDEPENDENT AT

00:57:13.329 --> 00:57:14.297
BECAUSE THAT'S THAT'S WHO I WANT

00:57:14.364 --> 00:57:15.732
TO BE I WANT TO BE AN

00:57:15.799 --> 00:57:17.667
INDEPENDENT -- BUT NOT

00:57:17.734 --> 00:57:20.069
NECESSARILY ESTABLISHED WITH THE

00:57:20.136 --> 00:57:20.637
AMERICAN INDEPENDENT PARTY I

00:57:20.703 --> 00:57:23.072
UNDERSTAND THAT -- I DO THINK

00:57:23.139 --> 00:57:24.641
THE BILL IS INCOMPLETE --

00:57:24.707 --> 00:57:26.376
HOWEVER BECAUSE I FEEL AS THOUGH

00:57:26.442 --> 00:57:27.877
IF WE'RE GONNA DO THIS THEN WE

00:57:27.944 --> 00:57:28.678
NEED TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT IF

00:57:28.745 --> 00:57:30.346
YOU'RE NEITHER A DEMOCRAT OR

00:57:30.413 --> 00:57:31.781
REPUBLICAN OR GO OR GREEN PARTY

00:57:31.848 --> 00:57:32.582
LIBERTARIAN.

00:57:32.649 --> 00:57:33.449
THE YOU ARE ACTUALLY AN

00:57:33.516 --> 00:57:35.051
INDEPENDENT YOU CAN CHECK A BOX

00:57:35.118 --> 00:57:37.453
IS INDEPENDENT I'M NOT DECLINE

00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:38.621
TO STATE AND NOTE FOR NOTE NO

00:57:38.688 --> 00:57:39.489
PARTY PREFERENCE AND I FEEL LIKE

00:57:39.556 --> 00:57:40.790
IF WE GO DOWN THIS ROAD WE

00:57:40.857 --> 00:57:42.926
SHOULD ADD THAT SO -- MAYBE WE

00:57:42.992 --> 00:57:44.227
CAN WORK ON THAT AND THE NEXT

00:57:44.294 --> 00:57:46.763
LEGISLATIVE SESSION -- BUT I

00:57:46.830 --> 00:57:46.996
THINK.

00:57:47.063 --> 00:57:47.630
THAT.

00:57:47.697 --> 00:57:50.033
USING THE TERM INDEPENDENT MAKES

00:57:50.099 --> 00:57:55.772
A MAKES SENSE -- AND THEN YOU

00:57:55.839 --> 00:57:56.573
KNOW TO THOSE WHO DON'T LIKE THE

00:57:56.639 --> 00:57:57.207
NAME CHANGE UNDERSTAND THE THE

00:57:57.273 --> 00:57:57.807
NAMES BEEN AROUND FOR A LONG

00:57:57.874 --> 00:57:59.843
TIME BUT I'M LOOKING AT THE BILL --

00:57:59.909 --> 00:58:01.544
ON PAGE.

00:58:01.611 --> 00:58:05.748
FOUR AND THEIR ONLINE -- SIX

00:58:05.815 --> 00:58:06.850
WILLIS DEADLINE FOR IT SAYS THE

00:58:06.916 --> 00:58:08.384
SECRETARY STATE SHALL NOTIFY

00:58:08.451 --> 00:58:09.853
EACH VOTER REGISTERED TO A PARTY

00:58:09.919 --> 00:58:11.855
DESCRIBED IN THIS SECTION AS

00:58:11.921 --> 00:58:13.089
FOLLOWS.

00:58:13.156 --> 00:58:14.958
AND THEN IT SAYS IF THE PARTY

00:58:15.024 --> 00:58:16.759
LAWFULLY CHANGES ITS NAME AS

00:58:16.826 --> 00:58:17.961
PROVIDED IN THIS SECTION AND

00:58:18.027 --> 00:58:19.829
NOTICE SHALL BE SENT INFORMING

00:58:19.896 --> 00:58:20.430
THE VOTER OF THE PARTIES NEW

00:58:20.496 --> 00:58:21.397
NAME.

00:58:21.464 --> 00:58:22.866
THAT THE VOTER SHALL CONTINUE TO

00:58:22.932 --> 00:58:24.300
BE REGISTERED TO THE PARTY BUT

00:58:24.367 --> 00:58:25.702
UNDER THE NEW NAME.

00:58:25.768 --> 00:58:27.203
AND SO FOR THIS IDEA THAT SOME

00:58:27.270 --> 00:58:28.872
ALL MY GOSH PEOPLE AREN'T GOING

00:58:28.938 --> 00:58:30.540
TO REGISTER FROM THAT'S NOT TRUE

00:58:30.607 --> 00:58:32.141
PEOPLE ARE CURRENTLY REGISTERED

00:58:32.208 --> 00:58:33.443
AS AN AMERICAN INDEPENDENT PARTY

00:58:33.509 --> 00:58:35.011
THEY'LL CONTINUE. TO BE

00:58:35.078 --> 00:58:36.813
REGISTERED UNDER THE NEW NAME OF

00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:38.348
THE PARTY SO WON'T HARM HARM

00:58:38.414 --> 00:58:40.550
THEM NOW OF COURSE AFTERWARDS

00:58:40.617 --> 00:58:42.085
THEY LOOK AT IT AWAY I'M NOT

00:58:42.151 --> 00:58:42.919
REGISTERED TO THAT AND THEY CAN

00:58:42.986 --> 00:58:44.487
DECIDE. TO CHANGE SO I THINK

00:58:44.554 --> 00:58:45.855
THAT'S CRAFTED WELL I JUST THINK

00:58:45.922 --> 00:58:48.358
IT'S INCOMPLETE -- I THINK -- WE

PERSPECTIVE -- AS A MILLENNIAL

00:59:14.550 --> 00:59:17.353
AND UNDERSTANDING -- THE IMPACT

00:59:17.420 --> 00:59:18.187
OF THIS COULD HAVE ON FUTURE

00:59:18.254 --> 00:59:19.789
GENERATIONS I I DON'T THINK THIS

00:59:21.958 --> 00:59:23.192
WINNERS LOSERS BETWEEN THE

00:59:23.259 --> 00:59:24.494
DIFFERENT PARTY PLATFORMS AND

00:59:24.560 --> 00:59:25.395
SEE THIS IS A POLITICALLY

00:59:25.461 --> 00:59:26.729
MOTIVATED ISSUE BECAUSE WE DON'T

00:59:53.156 --> 00:59:54.891
THAT THEY'RE NOT QUITE SURE

00:59:54.958 --> 00:59:56.159
WHERE THEY FALL BUT WHAT THEY DO

00:59:56.225 --> 00:59:57.260
KNOW IS THAT THEY'RE NOT

00:59:57.327 --> 00:59:58.361
NECESSARILY SIGNING UP TO BE A

00:59:58.428 --> 00:59:59.762
DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN BECAUSE

00:59:59.829 --> 01:00:01.030
THEY DON'T LIKE THE IDEA OF

01:00:01.097 --> 01:00:03.132
BUYING ALL IN TO ONE PARTY.

01:00:03.199 --> 01:00:04.801
THEY DON'T WANT TO BE DEFINED BY

01:00:04.867 --> 01:00:06.402
HAVING A D. BY THEIR NAME OR BY

01:00:06.469 --> 01:00:07.337
HAVING AN ARE BY THEIR NAME

01:00:07.403 --> 01:00:08.671
BECAUSE THEY DON'T SUBSCRIBE

ENTIRELY. TO WHAT EITHER OF

01:00:10.606 --> 01:00:11.841
THOSE PARTIES REPRESENT THEY

01:00:11.908 --> 01:00:13.343
WANT TO BE ABLE TO DECIDE FOR

01:00:13.409 --> 01:00:14.410
THEMSELVES.

01:00:14.477 --> 01:00:16.112
OKAY HERE'S A CANDIDATE THIS IS

01:00:16.179 --> 01:00:17.246
WHAT THEY STAND FOR THIS IS WHAT

01:00:17.313 --> 01:00:18.781
THEY REPRESENT AND THAT'S HOW

01:00:18.848 --> 01:00:19.916
THIS IS HOW IT ALIGNS WITH MY

01:00:19.983 --> 01:00:21.250
VALUES IS NOT THAT THEY'RE

01:00:21.317 --> 01:00:22.618
DEMOCRAT OR THE REPUBLICAN WHICH

01:00:22.685 --> 01:00:23.753
IS WHY I'M GONNA VOTE FOR THEM.

01:00:23.820 --> 01:00:24.787
IT'S WHO THEY ARE AS THE PRESENT

01:00:24.854 --> 01:00:26.489
PERSON WHAT THEY BRING TO

01:00:26.556 --> 01:00:27.790
GOVERNMENT THE KIND OF CHANGE IN

01:00:27.857 --> 01:00:29.125
THE IDEAS THAT THEY SUPPORT THAT

01:00:29.192 --> 01:00:30.760
I SUPPORT I WANT TO SUPPORT THAT

01:00:30.827 --> 01:00:31.661
INDIVIDUAL.

AND SELL THEIR NEEDS IT NEEDS TO

01:00:34.230 --> 01:00:34.931
BE CLEAR.

01:00:34.998 --> 01:00:36.666
WHEN I SIGN UP AND I WANT TO BE

01:00:36.733 --> 01:00:37.867
AN INDEPENDENT?

01:00:37.934 --> 01:00:39.669
IT'S NOT CLEAR.

01:00:39.736 --> 01:00:41.504
BECAUSE I HAVE TOO MANY OPTIONS

01:00:41.571 --> 01:00:43.172
THE LABEL ME AN INDEPENDENT.

01:00:43.239 --> 01:00:44.974

PARTY PREFERENCE OR ANYBODY ELSE

01:00:57.186 --> 01:00:58.354
AND SO THERE NEED TO BE MORE

01:00:58.421 --> 01:00:59.789
CLARITY ON THIS ISSUE.

01:00:59.856 --> 01:01:01.457
SO THAT WE ARE NOT RUNNING INTO

01:01:01.524 --> 01:01:02.859

THOSE AMENDMENTS ARE DIESEL IN

01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:00.349
COMMON FOR ONE OF THE ANALYSIS.

01:02:04.620 --> 01:02:06.556
I WANT TO THANK.

01:02:06.622 --> 01:02:07.323
WITH SENATOR FOR BRINGING THIS

01:02:07.390 --> 01:02:09.525
FORWARD -- I ASKED A COUPLE

01:02:09.592 --> 01:02:10.293
PEOPLE THAT I KNOW WHO BELIEVE

01:02:10.359 --> 01:02:11.260
THEIR INDEPENDENT WHO SIGNED UP

01:02:11.327 --> 01:02:12.595
FOR THIS AND NONE OF THEM HAD

01:02:12.662 --> 01:02:14.530
EVER READ ANYTHING ABOUT IT IS A

01:02:14.597 --> 01:02:16.165
FAIRLY INTELLIGENT PEOPLE.

01:02:16.232 --> 01:02:17.967
AND WHEN THEY READ IT THEY SAID

01:02:18.034 --> 01:02:19.535
THIS IS NOT WHAT I STAND FOR IN

01:02:19.602 --> 01:02:20.703
TERMS OF A PARTY.

01:02:20.770 --> 01:02:23.139
AND I I WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY

01:02:23.206 --> 01:02:25.141
I THINK TO MAKE THINGS VERY

01:02:25.208 --> 01:02:27.210
CLEAR -- TO INDIVIDUALS AND NOT

01:02:27.276 --> 01:02:28.244
TO DECEIVE THEM WE'VE BEEN ON

01:02:28.311 --> 01:02:30.413
THIS WHOLE ISSUE OF TRANSPARENCY

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:32.315
AND I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT --

01:02:32.381 --> 01:02:34.750
THAT WE MAKE THINGS AS CLEAR AS

01:02:34.817 --> 01:02:36.119
POSSIBLE SO PEOPLE CAN CHOOSE

01:02:36.185 --> 01:02:37.687
WHAT THEY REALLY BELIEVE.

01:02:37.753 --> 01:02:39.088
AND AND WHAT THEY REALLY WANT TO

01:02:39.155 --> 01:02:41.157
BE A PART OF AND SOME FOLKS WHO

01:02:41.224 --> 01:02:42.625
ARE VERY DISGUSTED WITH ALL

01:02:42.692 --> 01:02:44.093
PARTIES WANT TO BE INDEPENDENT.

01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:45.094
AND THEY THINK THEY ARE WHEN

01:02:45.161 --> 01:02:46.696
THEY SIGN UP FOR THIS THEY THEY

01:02:46.762 --> 01:02:47.330
THINK THEY ARE AND THEN THEY

01:02:47.396 --> 01:02:50.099
REPEAT WHAT THE PARTIES ABOUT AN

01:02:50.166 --> 01:02:52.335
OUT STARTED AND GEORGE WALLACE

01:02:52.401 --> 01:02:53.436
IN AUSTIN AGO GOD NO THAT'S NOT

01:02:53.503 --> 01:02:54.904
WHAT I'M ABOUT AND I SAID BUT

01:02:54.971 --> 01:02:56.239
THAT'S WHAT YOU SIGNED UP.

01:02:56.305 --> 01:02:58.941
FOR SO I THINK IT IT REALLY IS --

01:02:59.008 --> 01:03:00.543
YOU KNOW IT SOUNDS DIFFICULT TO

01:03:00.610 --> 01:03:01.711
TO HAVE TO GO AND DO THIS BUT AT

01:03:01.777 --> 01:03:04.347
THE SAME TIME IF YOU REALLY.

01:03:04.413 --> 01:03:05.681
JUST KNOWING HOW FOLKS ARE AND

01:03:05.748 --> 01:03:06.716
WHAT PEOPLE WANT TO BE

01:03:06.782 --> 01:03:07.750
INDEPENDENT YOU HEAR THE TERM

01:03:07.817 --> 01:03:09.986
INDEPENDENT AND AND AND AND MANY

01:03:10.052 --> 01:03:11.154
OF THEM AND WEEKS WE'VE

01:03:11.220 --> 01:03:12.488
OURSELVES OF CONFUSE PEOPLE WITH

01:03:12.555 --> 01:03:13.890
THIS OPEN PRIMARY THAT ISN'T

01:03:13.956 --> 01:03:14.957
REALLY OPEN.

01:03:15.024 --> 01:03:16.959
AND ALL THOSE OTHER KINDS OF

01:03:17.026 --> 01:03:17.793
THINGS THAT PEOPLE GET REALLY

01:03:17.860 --> 01:03:19.695
CONFUSED AND THEY THEN THEY GET

01:03:19.762 --> 01:03:21.030
FRUSTRATED WHEN THEY TRY TO VOTE.

01:03:21.097 --> 01:03:22.165
OF FOR PARTICULAR PARTY OR FILL

01:03:22.231 --> 01:03:23.666
OUT A FORM AND DISCOVER THAT

01:03:23.733 --> 01:03:25.067
THEY CAN'T VOTE BECAUSE THE

01:03:25.134 --> 01:03:26.636
AMERICAN INDEPENDENT THEY DIDN'T

01:03:26.702 --> 01:03:27.637
THINK THEY WERE IN A PARTY BUT

01:03:27.703 --> 01:03:28.504
THEY WERE BEING INDEPENDENT AND

01:03:28.571 --> 01:03:29.105
THEY COULD VOTE REPUBLICAN A

01:03:29.172 --> 01:03:29.972
DEMOCRAT.

01:03:30.039 --> 01:03:31.674
IN THE PRIMARY NOW THEY CAN'T

01:03:31.741 --> 01:03:32.975
AND THEY'RE FRUSTRATED AS IF

01:03:33.042 --> 01:03:34.677
WE'VE CONDOM AND AS A RESULT

01:03:34.744 --> 01:03:36.412
THEY LOSE ALL KINDS OF INTEREST

01:03:36.479 --> 01:03:37.947
IN THE POLITICAL PROCESS.

01:03:38.014 --> 01:03:39.682
BECAUSE THEY FEEL DECEIVED SO I

01:03:39.749 --> 01:03:41.117
THINK IS IS MANY THINGS WE CAN

01:03:41.184 --> 01:03:43.119
DO TO TRY TO CREATE CLARITY FOR

01:03:43.186 --> 01:03:44.687
VOTERS TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT

01:03:44.754 --> 01:03:45.755
THERE IS NO.

01:03:45.821 --> 01:03:46.789
UNDERLYING.

01:03:46.856 --> 01:03:49.592
MOTIVE IN THOSE KINDS OF THINGS

01:03:49.659 --> 01:03:50.159
TO SHIP THEM INTO A CERTAIN

01:03:50.226 --> 01:03:52.361
DIRECTION THE BETTER WE ARE AND

01:03:52.428 --> 01:03:54.096
OF THE FEW PEOPLE I ASKED ABOUT

01:03:54.163 --> 01:03:54.764
THIS WHO.

01:03:54.830 --> 01:03:56.165
LOOKED AT IT IT AND FELT THAT

01:03:56.232 --> 01:03:56.799
THEY HAD BEEN TO SEE THAT THEY

01:03:56.866 --> 01:03:57.867
HAD SIGNED UP WITH SOMETHING

01:03:57.934 --> 01:03:59.735
THAT THEY TRULY WERE FAR FAR

01:03:59.802 --> 01:04:00.503
AWAY FROM.

01:04:00.570 --> 01:04:02.638
IN TERMS OF THEIR OWN POLITICS

01:04:02.705 --> 01:04:04.006
AND HAD NO IDEA THAT THERE

01:04:04.073 --> 01:04:05.908
REALLY WAS A PARTY THEY LOOK FOR

01:04:05.975 --> 01:04:07.176
INDEPENDENT THEY WANT TO BE

01:04:07.243 --> 01:04:08.744
INDEPENDENT AND THEY DID THAT.

01:04:08.811 --> 01:04:09.879
AND SO I THINK WE HAVE TO DO

01:04:09.946 --> 01:04:11.514
WHAT WE CAN TO CLARIFY TO MAKE

01:04:11.581 --> 01:04:12.949
SURE THAT VOTERS ACTUALLY

01:04:13.015 --> 01:04:14.383
SIGNING OF WHAT THEY WANT.

01:04:14.450 --> 01:04:16.586
AND AND DO THAT I THINK ALSO WE

01:04:16.652 --> 01:04:18.321
WE NEED TO MOVE ALSO IS POOR

01:04:18.387 --> 01:04:19.188
SOMEONE POINTED OUT TO A

01:04:19.255 --> 01:04:20.656
CATEGORY OF INDEPENDENT SO

01:04:20.723 --> 01:04:21.857
PEOPLE CAN JUST SEE THAT UP

01:04:21.924 --> 01:04:23.593
FRONT RATHER THAN HAVING.

01:04:23.659 --> 01:04:29.532
TO KIND OF WAIT THE WHOLE BUNCH

01:04:29.599 --> 01:04:30.566
OF STUFF TO FIND IT BUT THANK

01:04:30.633 --> 01:04:31.367

ATTENTION -- I APPRECIATE THE

01:04:32.501 --> 01:04:33.569
RESEARCH HAS FINALLY BEEN DONE

CREATING AN INDEPENDENT PARTY.

01:06:06.495 --> 01:06:08.931

INCORPORATED INTO THIS AWARE

THAT'S ANOTHER SEPARATE EFFORT

01:07:26.809 --> 01:07:27.443
THAT SOMETHING WILL HAVE TO

HERE'S HERE'S WHAT WE NOW.

01:08:06.182 --> 01:08:07.183
WE KNOW THAT IF YOU'RE

01:08:07.249 --> 01:08:08.651
REGISTERED AS AN AMERICAN

01:08:08.717 --> 01:08:10.519
INDEPENDENT PARTY MEMBER YOU

01:08:10.586 --> 01:08:12.188
CANNOT VOTE IN THE DEMOCRATIC

01:08:12.254 --> 01:08:13.956
PRIMARY HOWEVER IF YOU ARE.

01:08:14.023 --> 01:08:15.391
A DECLINE TO STATE WHICH MOST

01:08:15.458 --> 01:08:16.992
PEOPLE TRADITIONALLY THINK OF AS

01:08:17.059 --> 01:08:18.627
AN INDEPENDENT YOU CAN'T WHETHER

01:08:18.694 --> 01:08:19.628
REPUBLICAN PARTY PERMITS THAT

01:08:19.695 --> 01:08:20.229
ARE NOT.

01:08:20.296 --> 01:08:21.464
THAT'S A SEPARATE QUESTION BUT

01:08:21.530 --> 01:08:22.431
THEY MAY WELL.

01:08:22.498 --> 01:08:23.799
ADOPT THE SAME RULES AS THE

01:08:23.866 --> 01:08:25.501
DEMOCRATIC PARTY WHICH AGAIN

01:08:25.568 --> 01:08:26.602
WOULD PRECLUDE AMERICAN

01:08:26.669 --> 01:08:28.037
INDEPENDENT PARTY MEMBER FROM

01:08:28.103 --> 01:08:29.672
VOTING IN THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY

01:08:29.738 --> 01:08:30.840
SO WE KNOW THAT.

01:08:30.906 --> 01:08:32.741
THAT EXISTS TODAY WE ALSO KNOW

01:08:32.808 --> 01:08:35.044
THE EVIDENCE IS OVERWHELMING

01:08:35.110 --> 01:08:36.745
THAT THOSE WHO ARE REGISTERED

01:08:36.812 --> 01:08:39.148
THE AS AMERICAN INDEPENDENCE --

01:08:39.215 --> 01:08:41.383
IN LARGE PART OBVIOUSLY NOT ALL

01:08:41.450 --> 01:08:43.185
BUT LARGE PART REGISTERED

01:08:43.252 --> 01:08:44.954
BECAUSE THEY TRULY WANTED TO BE.

01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:46.689
INDEPENDENT OF THE QUESTION

01:08:46.755 --> 01:08:47.790
RAISED BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER

01:08:47.857 --> 01:08:49.225
GALLAGHER IS TO WHETHER OR NOT

01:08:49.291 --> 01:08:50.326
THAT'S A COMPELLING STATE

01:08:50.392 --> 01:08:51.727
INTEREST I OBVIOUSLY DO BELIEVE

01:08:51.794 --> 01:08:53.028
IT'S A COMPELLING STATE INTEREST

01:08:53.095 --> 01:08:54.697
I THINK THAT THE EVIDENCE WILL

01:08:54.763 --> 01:08:55.564
DEMONSTRATE THAT IT'S A

01:08:55.631 --> 01:08:56.165
COMPELLING.

01:08:56.232 --> 01:08:58.200
STATE INTEREST TO ENSURE THAT

01:08:58.267 --> 01:09:00.169
VOTERS ARE NOT DECEIVED IN SO

01:09:00.236 --> 01:09:02.404
THAT VOTERS CAN FULLY EXERCISE

01:09:02.471 --> 01:09:04.340
THEIR FRANCHISE -- IN IN THE

01:09:04.406 --> 01:09:06.175
UPCOMING ELECTION AND IN FUTURE

01:09:06.242 --> 01:09:08.811
ELECTIONS -- BUT I SUPPOSE

01:09:08.878 --> 01:09:10.813
REASONABLE MINDS MIGHT DIFFER --

01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:12.915
AND IF IF IT DOES GO TO THE

01:09:12.982 --> 01:09:14.450
COURT HI I THINK THAT.

01:09:14.517 --> 01:09:16.385
ON BALANCE THE COURT WILL FIND

01:09:16.452 --> 01:09:17.486
THAT THERE IS A COMPELLING STATE

01:09:17.553 --> 01:09:19.021
INTEREST IN IN.

01:09:19.088 --> 01:09:21.423
PREVENTING SORT OF OF OBVIOUS AN

01:09:21.490 --> 01:09:25.528
INTENTIONAL VOTER CONFUSION.

01:09:25.594 --> 01:09:26.161
SO HAVING SAID THAT I WOULD URGE

01:09:26.228 --> 01:09:27.997
AN AYE VOTE.

01:09:28.063 --> 01:09:29.098
THE CENTER -- WHILE AND WELL IT

01:09:29.164 --> 01:09:31.200
IS A SIGNIFICANT STEP TO REQUIRE

01:09:31.267 --> 01:09:32.868
POLITICAL PARTY TO CHANGES NAME.

01:09:32.935 --> 01:09:34.370
THERE IS SIGNIFICANT EVIDENCE

01:09:34.436 --> 01:09:35.471
THAT A LARGE NUMBER OF VOTERS

01:09:35.538 --> 01:09:37.439
WHO DO NOT WANT TO BE AFFILIATED

01:09:37.506 --> 01:09:38.607
WITH POLITICAL PARTIES ARE

01:09:38.674 --> 01:09:40.376
MISTAKENLY REGISTERING WITH THE

01:09:40.442 --> 01:09:41.777
AMERICAN INDEPENDENT PARTY.

01:09:41.844 --> 01:09:43.245
AND THAT MISTAKE CAN PREVENT

01:09:43.312 --> 01:09:45.214
VOTERS FROM BEING ABLE TO VOTE

01:09:45.281 --> 01:09:46.715
FOR THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE

01:09:46.782 --> 01:09:48.350
OF THEIR CHOICE WHICH I AGREE IS

01:09:48.417 --> 01:09:49.952
A COMPELLING STATE INTEREST --

01:09:50.019 --> 01:09:50.953
SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS

01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:52.321

FOR WORKING WITH US -- BECAUSE

01:12:27.543 --> 01:12:28.577
THIS SONG LEGISLATION IT ARISES

01:12:28.644 --> 01:12:29.278
OUT OF TWO PIECES OF LEGISLATION

01:12:29.344 --> 01:12:30.212
THAT THE LEGISLATURE PASSED IN

01:12:30.279 --> 01:12:32.414
THE GOVERNOR SIGNED IN.

01:12:32.481 --> 01:12:34.249

OF INCREASING TRANSPARENCY FOR

01:12:37.786 --> 01:12:41.190

01:12:41.256 --> 01:12:43.392
REQUIRING THAT IN THE SEVENTY

01:12:43.459 --> 01:12:45.427
FIVE WORD OP BALLOT QUESTION

WOULD BE REQUIRED TO BE INCLUDED --

01:12:54.269 --> 01:12:57.005
WHILE THIS APPROACH MAKES SENSE

01:12:57.072 --> 01:12:58.607
FOR A VERY SIMPLE TAXES SUCH AS

01:12:58.674 --> 01:13:01.043
SALES TAX OR A STRAIGHT UP --

01:13:01.110 --> 01:13:03.512
PARCEL TAX WITH ONLY ONE RATE

WITH NO EXEMPTIONS -- FOR BONDS

01:13:05.914 --> 01:13:07.850
OR FOR MORE COMPLICATED PARCEL

01:13:07.916 --> 01:13:14.022
TAXES -- IT DOESN'T WORK AND SO

01:13:14.089 --> 01:13:16.225
FOR EXAMPLE.

01:13:16.291 --> 01:13:18.660
HI OF RIGHT NOW I HAVE A PURE --

A MULTI TIER PARCEL TAX -- AND

01:13:21.396 --> 01:13:22.231
WE FREQUENTLY HAVE PARCEL TAXES

01:13:22.297 --> 01:13:23.031
WHERE FOR EXAMPLE COMMERCIAL

01:13:23.098 --> 01:13:24.566
MIGHT PAY MORE THAN RESIDENTIAL

01:13:24.633 --> 01:13:26.368
OR MIGHT BE TIERED BASED ON THE

01:13:26.435 --> 01:13:28.704
SIZE OF A PROPERTY OR THE VALUE

01:13:28.771 --> 01:13:32.007
OF PRO OR THE OR OTHER --

01:13:32.074 --> 01:13:33.609
FACTORS OR YOU MIGHT HAVE A

01:13:33.675 --> 01:13:35.878
SENIOR EXEMPTION OR A LOW INCOME

01:13:35.944 --> 01:13:38.247
EXEMPTION -- AND UNDER THE LAW

01:13:38.313 --> 01:13:40.649
AS IT IS NOW FOR A PARCEL TAX IN

01:13:40.716 --> 01:13:43.252
THAT SEVENTY FIVE WORDS YOU HAVE.

01:13:43.318 --> 01:13:45.187
TO YOU HAVE TO DESCRIBE EVERY

01:13:45.254 --> 01:13:47.689
SINGLE TEAR -- AND WHEN YOU HAVE

01:13:47.756 --> 01:13:48.824
MORE THAN ONE TEAR.

01:13:48.891 --> 01:13:50.392
ON IT BECOMES PHYSICALLY

01:13:50.459 --> 01:13:52.895
IMPOSSIBLE TO FIT IT WITH IN

01:13:52.961 --> 01:13:56.365
SEVENTY FIVE WORDS THIS IS ONE

01:13:56.431 --> 01:13:59.301
OF PARTICULAR -- PARTIAL TAX

01:13:59.368 --> 01:14:01.570
QUESTION.

01:14:01.637 --> 01:14:03.839
AND WHAT WE'VE DONE IS WE HAVE

01:14:03.906 --> 01:14:05.174
BEEN IN BLACK UP TO THOSE

01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:07.042
SEVENTY FIVE WORDS AND AFTER

01:14:07.109 --> 01:14:08.043
SEVENTY FIVE WORDS IT'S GREAT

01:14:08.110 --> 01:14:08.644
OUT.

01:14:08.710 --> 01:14:11.747
YOU CAN SEE THAT UNDER THE LAWS

01:14:11.814 --> 01:14:12.981
THAT WE PASS TWENTY FIFTEEN

01:14:13.048 --> 01:14:14.016
SEVENTEEN THIS PARCEL TAX WOULD

01:14:14.082 --> 01:14:15.784
EFFECTIVELY BECOME ILLEGAL IN

01:14:15.851 --> 01:14:17.686
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- AND

01:14:17.753 --> 01:14:19.087
WEBELIEVE THE OVERWHELMINGLY

01:14:19.154 --> 01:14:21.023
TIERED PARCEL TAXES EVEN SIMPLE

01:14:21.089 --> 01:14:22.991
ONES OUT PROVIDE ONE OR TWO

01:14:23.058 --> 01:14:24.693
EXEMPTIONS TO SENIOR TO LOW

01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:25.060
INCOME PEOPLE.

01:14:25.127 --> 01:14:26.962
OUGHT WOULD EFFECTIVELY BE

01:14:27.029 --> 01:14:28.897
PROHIBITED IN THE STATE OF

01:14:28.964 --> 01:14:30.299
CALIFORNIA THAT WOULD AND FORCE

01:14:30.365 --> 01:14:32.801
US TO HAVE MORE REGRESSIVE

01:14:32.868 --> 01:14:34.469
TAXATION BECAUSE THE ONLY KIND

01:14:34.536 --> 01:14:36.538
OF PARCEL TAX YOU COULD EVER DO.

01:14:36.605 --> 01:14:38.707
IS A FLAT PARCEL TAX THAT

01:14:38.774 --> 01:14:39.842
EVERYONE PAYS THE SAME THE

01:14:39.908 --> 01:14:41.076
MATTER HOW RICH OR POOR WEATHER

01:14:41.143 --> 01:14:43.312
A BIG COMMERCIAL BUILDING OR A

01:14:43.378 --> 01:14:44.813
SINGLE FAMILY HOME.

01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:46.782
ALSO ON PARTS YOUR PARCEL TAXES

01:14:46.849 --> 01:14:50.919
THE THE THE LEGISLATION

01:14:50.986 --> 01:14:53.655
EFFECTIVELY BANS ON ONE BONDS --

01:14:53.722 --> 01:14:54.556
THE IT ALSO CREATES SIGNIFICANT

01:14:54.623 --> 01:14:55.190
PROBLEMS FIRST OF ALL IT

01:14:55.257 --> 01:14:56.225
REQUIRES A LOT OF ADDITIONAL

01:14:56.291 --> 01:14:58.660
LANGUAGE THAT TAKES AWAY FROM

01:14:58.727 --> 01:14:59.728
THE SEVENTY FIVE OR A

01:14:59.795 --> 01:15:00.996
DESCRIPTION OF WHAT THE BOND

01:15:01.063 --> 01:15:02.831
ACTUALLY DIES AND MAKES IT A LOT

01:15:02.898 --> 01:15:04.967
HARDER -- FOR CITIES AND LOCAL

01:15:05.033 --> 01:15:06.602
GOVERNMENTS TO DESCRIBE WHAT THE

01:15:06.668 --> 01:15:08.837
BOND DOES AN ACCURATE WAY.

01:15:08.904 --> 01:15:10.105
IT ALSO CREATES SIGNIFICANT

01:15:10.172 --> 01:15:13.942
CONFUSION BECAUSE YOUR OUGHT WE

01:15:14.009 --> 01:15:15.644
KNOW THAT IN TERMS OF THE TAX

01:15:15.711 --> 01:15:17.346
IMPACT OF BONDS YOU CAN'T

01:15:17.412 --> 01:15:18.680
PREDICT WHAT IT IS WHEN YOU GO

01:15:18.747 --> 01:15:19.648
TO THE BALLOT.

01:15:19.715 --> 01:15:21.383
IT DEPENDS ON WHAT THE INTEREST

01:15:21.450 --> 01:15:23.585
RATE IS A TIME FOR EXAMPLE AND

01:15:23.652 --> 01:15:25.587
SO IT DEPENDS ON WHEN THE BOND

01:15:25.654 --> 01:15:27.055
IS SOLD IN A BOND CAN BE SOLD

01:15:27.122 --> 01:15:27.756
YEARS.

01:15:27.823 --> 01:15:29.191
AFTER THE VOTERS ACTUALLY

01:15:29.258 --> 01:15:31.560
AUTHORIZED THE BOND AND SO WHAT

01:15:31.627 --> 01:15:35.130
THAT FORCES AUG CITIES TO DO IS

01:15:35.197 --> 01:15:36.498
TO LIST EITHER A BLINDING OR AN

01:15:36.565 --> 01:15:38.600
AVERAGE -- RANGE AS VERY

01:15:38.667 --> 01:15:40.569
SPECULATIVE AND MISLEADING TO

01:15:40.636 --> 01:15:43.805
THE VOTERS THE GOAL HERE IS

01:15:43.872 --> 01:15:46.308
TRANSPARENCY.

01:15:46.375 --> 01:15:46.875
AT A AT A FORCES CITIES TO

01:15:46.942 --> 01:15:48.310
PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT

01:15:48.377 --> 01:15:48.877
PEOPLE WILL PAY ON BONDS.

01:15:48.944 --> 01:15:50.679
THAT MAY NOT PERTAIN TO THAT

01:15:50.746 --> 01:15:51.513
PARTICULAR.

01:15:51.580 --> 01:15:53.515
PERSON THIS IS ALL WITHIN THE

01:15:53.582 --> 01:15:54.850
SEVENTY FIVE WORDS WE KNOW THAT

01:15:54.917 --> 01:15:56.718
IN -- TWENTY EIGHTEEN IN TERMS

01:15:56.785 --> 01:15:59.054
OF STATEWIDE THE PERCENTAGES ON

01:15:59.121 --> 01:16:00.622
THESE BONDS IMPARTIAL TAXES WENT

01:16:00.689 --> 01:16:02.724
DOWN AND WE BELIEVE IT WAS A

01:16:02.791 --> 01:16:04.326
REAL AS A RESULT OF OF THIS

01:16:04.393 --> 01:16:06.828
CHANGE WE MAKE IT EXCEPTIONALLY

01:16:06.895 --> 01:16:07.562
HARD.

01:16:07.629 --> 01:16:09.031
IN CALIFORNIA FOR LOCAL

01:16:09.097 --> 01:16:11.266
GOVERNMENTS TO RAISE REVENUE.

01:16:11.333 --> 01:16:12.668
WE THEY OVERWHELMINGLY HAVE TO

01:16:12.734 --> 01:16:14.569
GET A TWO THIRDS VOTE ON BONDS

01:16:14.636 --> 01:16:16.271
WITH THE EXCEPTION SCHOOL

01:16:16.338 --> 01:16:17.606
FACILITIES.

01:16:17.673 --> 01:16:20.309
A AND ON PARCEL TAXES TWO THIRDS

01:16:20.375 --> 01:16:21.643
VOTE IS A VERY VERY HIGH

01:16:21.710 --> 01:16:24.046
THRESHOLD ALREADY AND WE SEE THE

01:16:24.112 --> 01:16:25.514
CONSEQUENCES OF HEALTH HARDLY

01:16:25.580 --> 01:16:27.115
MAKE IT FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT.

01:16:27.182 --> 01:16:29.284
IN THAT THE FUNDING OF LOCAL

01:16:29.351 --> 01:16:31.420
CRITICAL SERVICES THAT FIRE

01:16:31.486 --> 01:16:34.156
STATIONS THAT CLOSE LIBRARY THIS

01:16:34.222 --> 01:16:35.257
NUMBER OF CITIES OF SCALE BACK

01:16:35.324 --> 01:16:37.292
OR ELIMINATED THEIR LIBRARY

01:16:37.359 --> 01:16:37.893
SYSTEMS.

01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:39.795
ROAD PAVING PUBLIC

01:16:39.861 --> 01:16:40.829
TRANSPORTATION.

01:16:40.896 --> 01:16:42.130
THERE'S SO MUCH THAT WE EXPECT

01:16:42.197 --> 01:16:43.799
OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND WE MADE

01:16:43.865 --> 01:16:49.771
IT HARD AND WE MADE IT MUCH.

01:16:49.838 --> 01:16:52.307
HARDER EVEN HARDER WITH THESE

01:16:52.374 --> 01:16:53.809
TWO LAWS -- SO WHAT THIS BILL

01:16:53.875 --> 01:16:55.077
WILL DO IS -- INSTEAD OF REQUIRE

01:16:55.143 --> 01:16:56.378
ALL THAT IN THE SEVENTY FIVE

01:16:56.445 --> 01:16:57.546
WORDS TO PUT IT INTO THE VOTER

HANDBOOK WITHOUT INDICATION --

01:16:59.915 --> 01:17:02.050
AS AMENDED PER -- OF THE GREEN

01:17:02.117 --> 01:17:03.618
WITH THE COMMITTEE SO THE VOTERS

01:17:03.685 --> 01:17:04.987

01:17:05.053 --> 01:17:06.955
DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT TAX

01:17:07.022 --> 01:17:08.657
IMPACTS.

01:17:08.724 --> 01:17:10.125
WHEN YOU GO TO THE VOTER GUIDE?

01:17:10.192 --> 01:17:11.827

BILLS TOGETHER -- WE SAT DOWN WE

01:17:20.569 --> 01:17:22.571
TALKED ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR --

01:17:22.637 --> 01:17:24.473
BILL AND IT'S NEVER COMFORTABLE --

01:17:24.539 --> 01:17:26.375
TO TRY -- TO CHANGE -- REPEAL A

01:17:26.441 --> 01:17:27.909
BILL THAT A COLLEAGUE A

01:17:27.976 --> 01:17:29.711
RESPECTED COLLEAGUE -- HAS A

01:17:29.778 --> 01:17:32.347
AUTHORED BUT I THINK HERE -- WE

01:17:32.414 --> 01:17:34.516
NEED TO DO THIS US OF THAT OUR

01:17:34.583 --> 01:17:35.884
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS.

CAN ACTUALLY OP FUND THEMSELVES --

01:17:38.053 --> 01:17:38.820
AND I THINK THAT THE RESOLUTION

01:17:38.887 --> 01:17:40.422
REACH WITH THE COMMITTEE IS A

01:17:40.489 --> 01:17:42.858
GOOD ONE USES THE WORD TAX IT'S

IT AS A PARCEL TAX.

01:17:49.731 --> 01:17:51.433
SO I THINK THAT THE TRANSPARENCY --

01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:53.268
IS MAINTAINED -- AND I

01:17:53.335 --> 01:17:54.669

01:18:22.798 --> 01:18:23.298
LOCAL BONDS ARE THE PRIMARY

01:18:23.365 --> 01:18:24.566
SOURCE OF REVENUE TO CONSTRUCT

01:18:24.633 --> 01:18:26.201

DESERVES A CLEAN SAFE SCHOOL PER

01:18:30.806 --> 01:18:33.075
OUR CONSTITUTION -- IT IS

01:18:33.141 --> 01:18:35.377
IMPORTANT THAT WE COMMUNICATE

01:18:35.444 --> 01:18:37.379
CLEARLY AND ACCURATELY WITH OUR

01:18:37.446 --> 01:18:38.814

COVENANTS BETWEEN SCHOOL

CONTINUE TO HAVE THE SUPPORT OF

01:18:48.757 --> 01:18:49.958
OUR COMMUNITIES.

01:18:50.025 --> 01:18:51.226
RECENT CHANGES TO THE ELECTIONS

01:18:51.293 --> 01:18:52.527
COULD MAKE IT SIGNIFICANTLY MORE

01:18:52.594 --> 01:18:54.996
DIFFICULT FOR SCHOOLS ESPECIALLY

01:18:55.063 --> 01:18:57.032
LOW WEALTH DISTRACTS. TO MEET

01:18:57.099 --> 01:18:58.400
THEIR OBLIGATIONS HOUSE STUDENTS

01:18:58.467 --> 01:18:59.868
WERE ESPECIALLY CONCERNED BY THE

01:18:59.935 --> 01:19:01.470
A FAX THAT THE RECENT CHANGES

01:19:01.536 --> 01:19:02.904
HAVE ON DISTRICTS ABOUT A

01:19:02.971 --> 01:19:04.840
DEMONSTRATED HISTORY OF

01:19:04.906 --> 01:19:06.241
SUPPORTING LOCAL BONDS. FOR

01:19:06.308 --> 01:19:07.542
LOCAL BONDS AS THE SENATOR

01:19:07.609 --> 01:19:10.145
DESCRIBED THE RATE CHARGED TO

01:19:10.212 --> 01:19:11.246
PAY PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST

01:19:11.313 --> 01:19:13.315
PAYMENTS DOES CHANGE ANNUALLY

01:19:13.381 --> 01:19:14.783
BASED ON ECONOMIC FACTORS SUCH

01:19:14.850 --> 01:19:16.284
AS INTEREST RATES AND PROPERTY

01:19:16.351 --> 01:19:17.285
VALUES.

01:19:17.352 --> 01:19:19.354
IN ONE EXAMPLE WE HAD A SCHOOL

01:19:19.421 --> 01:19:21.623
WITH A RATE OF NINETEEN DOLLARS

01:19:21.690 --> 01:19:22.991
PER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS

01:19:23.058 --> 01:19:24.693
ASSESSED VALUATION IN TWO

01:19:24.759 --> 01:19:26.294
THOUSAND AND NINE THEN THE GREAT

01:19:26.361 --> 01:19:27.796
RECESSION HIT OUR PROPERTY

01:19:27.863 --> 01:19:29.331
VALUES TANKS AND THEY HAD TO

01:19:29.397 --> 01:19:31.800
RAISE THAT RATE. TO SIXTY FOUR

01:19:31.867 --> 01:19:33.135
DOLLARS THE VERY NEXT YEAR AND

01:19:33.201 --> 01:19:33.969
TWENTY TIMES YOU CAN SEE IT'S A

01:19:34.035 --> 01:19:35.971
REALLY WIDE SPREAD AND IT'S VERY

01:19:36.037 --> 01:19:37.305
DIFFICULT TO COMMUNICATE THOUGHT

01:19:37.372 --> 01:19:38.573
TO VOTERS.

01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:40.075
ON THE SEVENTY FIVE FOR A BALLOT

01:19:40.142 --> 01:19:44.212
STATEMENT.

01:19:44.279 --> 01:19:45.514
THE ABOUT THAT WE REYES ANNUALLY.

01:19:45.580 --> 01:19:47.182
THE AMOUNT OF THE DURATION WILL

01:19:47.249 --> 01:19:47.782
ALSO FLUCTUATE.

01:19:47.849 --> 01:19:48.416
THE BOTTOM LINE OF ALL OF THIS

01:19:48.483 --> 01:19:49.484
IS THAT THE INFORMATION DOESN'T

01:19:49.551 --> 01:19:51.153
MAKE SENSE FOR LOCAL BONDS AND

01:19:51.219 --> 01:19:53.054
WE DON'T HAVE SPACE ON THAT

01:19:53.121 --> 01:19:53.555
SEVENTY FIVE OR BALLOTS

01:19:53.622 --> 01:19:54.523
STATEMENT TO MAKE THE DETAILED

01:19:54.589 --> 01:19:56.024
EXPLANATION.

01:19:56.091 --> 01:19:57.392
THE COST OF THIS IS VOTER

01:19:57.459 --> 01:19:59.361
CONFUSION WHEN VOTERS ARE

01:19:59.427 --> 01:20:01.129
CONFUSED THE TO VOTE NOW AND

SURE MEMBER SAYS THAT IS ONLY

01:20:30.525 --> 01:20:31.526

FINANCIAL NEEDS FOR

01:20:48.510 --> 01:20:50.312
INFRASTRUCTURE -- WE HAVE SEEN

01:20:50.378 --> 01:20:51.780
THAT THE BALLOT LABELS OF

01:20:51.846 --> 01:20:54.783
CURRENTLY ARE AFFECTING VOTER OF

01:20:54.849 --> 01:20:56.318
A GUIDANCE HERE ON THESE ISSUES.

01:20:56.384 --> 01:20:57.652
IN FACT I'M ALSO A MEMBER OF THE

01:20:57.719 --> 01:20:58.787
STATE ALLOCATION BOARD WHERE WE

01:20:58.853 --> 01:21:00.522
JUST APPROVED.

01:21:00.589 --> 01:21:03.158
A A SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT HAD

01:21:03.225 --> 01:21:04.793
GONE -- IT WAS BIG ACTUALLY

01:21:04.859 --> 01:21:06.094
UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT WOULD

01:21:06.161 --> 01:21:08.129
GONE TO THE BALLOT FOUR TIMES TO

01:21:08.196 --> 01:21:10.065
GET A LOCAL BOND MEASURE PASSED

01:21:10.131 --> 01:21:10.665
AND THEY WERE AFFECTED BY THE

01:21:10.732 --> 01:21:13.702
FIRE -- AND OF COURSE THIS STATE

01:21:13.768 --> 01:21:14.769
OCCASION BOARD WAS ABLE TO

01:21:14.836 --> 01:21:16.705
EXEMPT THE CURRENT REGULATIONS

01:21:16.771 --> 01:21:17.839
TO PROVIDE THEM THE NECESSARY

01:21:17.906 --> 01:21:19.341
FUNDING THAT THEY PROVIDED.

01:21:19.407 --> 01:21:20.508
BUT THEY HAD GONE OUT FOUR TIMES

01:21:20.575 --> 01:21:23.044
AND THEY RAN OUT AGAIN IN.

01:21:23.111 --> 01:21:24.412
TWENTY EIGHTEEN OF THE VOTERS IN

01:21:24.479 --> 01:21:27.415
THAT AREA ARE VERY CONSERVATIVE --

01:21:27.482 --> 01:21:29.050
THE BALLOT LABEL ALONE DID NOT

01:21:29.117 --> 01:21:29.751
ALLOW THAT SCHOOL DISTRICT

01:21:29.818 --> 01:21:30.685
ACTUALLY FULFILL THEIR

01:21:30.752 --> 01:21:32.354

01:21:32.420 --> 01:21:33.388

01:21:33.455 --> 01:21:35.757
WE BELIEVE THAT OUT OF THE DEAL

01:21:35.824 --> 01:21:37.692
THAT HAS BEEN STRUCK THE BALANCE

01:21:37.759 --> 01:21:38.893
THE OLDER HAS BEEN STRUCK BY

01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:40.562
YOURSELF IN THE AND THE SENATOR

01:21:41.496 --> 01:21:41.930
COMMITTEE.

01:21:41.997 --> 01:21:43.565
IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT

01:21:43.632 --> 01:21:50.605
STILL ALLOWS VOTERS TO BE

01:21:50.672 --> 01:21:52.274
DIRECTED TO THE VOTER GUIDE I TO

01:21:52.340 --> 01:21:52.907

01:21:52.974 --> 01:21:53.808
LOT OF THE INFORMATION LIVES AND

01:21:53.875 --> 01:21:54.075
SHOULD BE.

01:21:54.142 --> 01:21:55.443
IT SHOULD NOT BE.

01:21:55.510 --> 01:21:56.611
AND THE ACTUAL LANGUAGE BECAUSE

01:21:56.678 --> 01:21:57.979

01:21:59.314 --> 01:22:01.216
GOOD AT A LOSS AS TO WHAT THE

01:22:02.984 --> 01:22:03.652
CRIME IS FOR THAT INFRASTRUCTURE --

SEEKS TO EXEMPTS THESE BOND

01:25:20.281 --> 01:25:21.950
ISSUANCES FROM WAS BUILT

01:25:22.016 --> 01:25:23.284

AB EIGHT OH NINE ORIGINALLY AND

01:25:24.886 --> 01:25:26.821

THAT THE TRANSPARENCY

01:25:29.324 --> 01:25:30.692
REQUIREMENTS EXTENDED TO BOND

01:25:30.758 --> 01:25:32.694
ISSUANCES MY MOTIVATION FOR

01:25:32.760 --> 01:25:34.262
INTRODUCING THAT LEGISLATION WAS

01:25:34.329 --> 01:25:35.930
A STRONG FEELING THAT WE OUGHT

01:25:35.997 --> 01:25:36.898
TO BE TRANSPARENT WITH VOTERS

01:25:36.965 --> 01:25:38.700
WHEN THEY VOTE ON SOMETHING THAT

01:25:38.766 --> 01:25:40.268
INCREASES TAXES ON THE BALLOT.

01:25:40.335 --> 01:25:43.438
THAT IT IS INDEED A TAX INCREASE.

01:25:43.505 --> 01:25:44.439
AB ONE NINETY FIVE SEVERAL YEARS

01:25:44.506 --> 01:25:46.074
AGO PASSED UNANIMOUSLY IN BOTH

01:25:46.140 --> 01:25:47.408
CHAMBERS EVERY MEMBER OF THIS

COMMITTEE VOTED FOR IT.

01:25:48.943 --> 01:25:51.212
NOW I WILL BE THE FIRST TO ADMIT

01:25:51.279 --> 01:25:52.313
THAT THE LAST OF SOME OF THE

01:25:52.380 --> 01:25:53.515
CONCERNS OF BEEN RAISED BY THE

01:25:53.581 --> 01:25:54.949
SPONSOR HERE ARE COMPLETELY

01:25:55.016 --> 01:25:57.118
VALID -- I THINK THAT THE CHAIR

01:25:57.185 --> 01:25:58.386
TAX RATES FOR SOMETHING THAT

01:25:58.453 --> 01:26:00.822
SHOULD GO IN THE VOTER GUIDE --

01:26:00.889 --> 01:26:02.891
I THINK THAT THE SAFE HAVEN THAT

01:26:02.957 --> 01:26:04.192
THEY PROPOSED FOR IF THEY'VE

01:26:04.259 --> 01:26:05.994
USED A GOOD FAITH ESTIMATE OF

01:26:06.060 --> 01:26:07.328
THINGS LIKE BONTA RATIONS --

01:26:07.395 --> 01:26:09.697
BOND RATES THAT -- THEY OUGHT TO

01:26:09.764 --> 01:26:10.331
BE -- IS LONG AS THEY'VE ACTED

01:26:10.398 --> 01:26:11.833
IN GOOD FAITH IF THEY OUGHT TO

01:26:11.900 --> 01:26:13.167
BE -- PROTECTED AGAINST

01:26:13.234 --> 01:26:17.205
VALIDATION I WOULD AGREE WITH

01:26:17.272 --> 01:26:18.106
ALL OF THAT HOWEVER.

01:26:18.172 --> 01:26:19.240
I STILL THINK WE NEED TO TELL

01:26:19.307 --> 01:26:19.841
THE VOTERS THAT THEY'RE VOTING

01:26:19.908 --> 01:26:20.909
ON A TAX INCREASE AND THAT SEEMS

01:26:20.975 --> 01:26:22.844
TO BE WHAT THEY WANT TO AVOID

01:26:22.911 --> 01:26:23.778
DOING SO.

01:26:23.845 --> 01:26:25.747
IN THE YEARS SINCE AB ONE NINETY

01:26:25.813 --> 01:26:27.482
FIVE PASSED I HAVE TRIED TWICE

01:26:27.549 --> 01:26:29.183
TO WORK WITH THE SPONSOR.

01:26:29.250 --> 01:26:31.085
IN RECTIFYING THE SITUATION AND

01:26:31.152 --> 01:26:32.186
THEY HAVE OPPOSED MY LEGISLATION

01:26:32.253 --> 01:26:33.855
BOTH TIMES BECAUSE THE ONE THING

01:26:33.922 --> 01:26:35.523
I'M NOT WILLING TO DO.

01:26:35.590 --> 01:26:36.724
IS TO AVOID TELLING VOTERS THAT

01:26:36.791 --> 01:26:39.327
THEY'RE VOTING ON A TAX INCREASE.

01:26:39.394 --> 01:26:40.395
SO.

01:26:40.461 --> 01:26:41.195
I DON'T WANT TO VILIFY THE

01:26:41.262 --> 01:26:42.764
SPONSORS HERE REALIZE THAT THEY

01:26:42.830 --> 01:26:43.631
HAVE A JOB TO DO.

01:26:43.698 --> 01:26:44.899
AND THE THE REPRESENTING THEIR

01:26:44.966 --> 01:26:46.601
INTERESTS BUT WE HAVE A JOB TO

01:26:46.668 --> 01:26:48.102
DO TO IN OUR JOB IS TO BE THE

01:26:48.169 --> 01:26:49.804
FULCRUM BETWEEN SPECIAL

01:26:49.871 --> 01:26:51.105
INTERESTS ON ONE SIDE.

01:26:51.172 --> 01:26:52.874
AND TAXPAYER PROTECTION ON THE

01:26:52.941 --> 01:26:54.676
OTHER SIDE AND I DON'T THINK

01:26:54.742 --> 01:26:56.744
IT'S UNREASONABLE TO TELETEXT

01:26:56.811 --> 01:26:57.812
PLAYERS THAT THEY'RE VOTING ON A

01:26:57.879 --> 01:26:58.780
TAX INCREASE.

01:26:58.846 --> 01:27:00.515
SO TALKING ABOUT THE SPECIFIC

01:27:00.582 --> 01:27:01.683
LANGUAGE OF THIS BILL.

01:27:01.749 --> 01:27:04.018
THIS BILL JUST REQUIRES THAT

01:27:04.085 --> 01:27:05.453
EVERYTHING GO IN THE VOTER GUIDE

01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:06.754
AND THAT THE ONLY THING ON THE

01:27:06.821 --> 01:27:10.892
BALLOT STATEMENT SAY AS AMENDED

01:27:10.959 --> 01:27:12.093

01:27:15.697 --> 01:27:18.232
THIS MEASURE.

01:27:18.299 --> 01:27:18.833
IT REDUCES THE BOND THAT WERE

01:27:18.900 --> 01:27:20.234

SEE VOTER GUIDE FOR TAX RATE

01:27:25.073 --> 01:27:26.407
INFORMATION I DON'T THINK THAT

01:27:26.474 --> 01:27:28.076
THAT'S BEING TRANSPARENT.

01:27:28.142 --> 01:27:30.178
SOME SOLUTIONS THAT I HAVE

01:27:30.244 --> 01:27:31.279
OFFERED.

01:27:31.346 --> 01:27:32.780
WERE FIRST I OFFERED.

01:27:32.847 --> 01:27:34.248
I PUT EVERYTHING THE VOTER GUIDE

01:27:34.315 --> 01:27:35.750
AND LET'S SAY.

01:27:35.817 --> 01:27:37.518
THIS MEASURE INCREASES PROPERTY

01:27:37.585 --> 01:27:39.287
TAXES SEE VOTER GUIDE FOR

01:27:39.354 --> 01:27:40.355
INFORMATION.

01:27:40.421 --> 01:27:42.857
I WAS TOLD THAT NO YOU CAN'T SAY

01:27:42.924 --> 01:27:44.425
TAX INCREASE THAT THAT'S A NON

01:27:44.492 --> 01:27:44.993
STARTER.

01:27:45.059 --> 01:27:46.427
SO I SAID OKAY ABOUT THIS.

01:27:46.494 --> 01:27:49.030
THIS MEASURE AFFECTS TAX RATES

01:27:49.097 --> 01:27:52.133
SEE VOTER GUIDE FOR INFORMATION.

01:27:52.200 --> 01:27:54.636
AND THAT WAS REJECTED ALSO.

01:27:54.702 --> 01:27:55.503
YOU KNOW I THINK IT REALLY GOES

01:27:55.570 --> 01:27:56.904
TO THE MOTIVATION HERE OF WHAT

01:27:56.971 --> 01:27:57.705
WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH

01:27:57.772 --> 01:27:58.006
[inaudible]

01:27:58.072 --> 01:28:00.308
UP.

01:28:00.375 --> 01:28:02.744
IF THIS SHOULD NOT PASSED TODAY

01:28:02.810 --> 01:28:04.112
AND I'M ASKING YOU TO EITHER

01:28:04.178 --> 01:28:05.079
VOTE NOR JUST TO LAY OFF A WE

01:28:05.146 --> 01:28:06.648
WORK THIS OUTI WILL PLEDGE TO

01:28:06.714 --> 01:28:08.716
TRY A THIRD TIME NEXT YEAR TO

01:28:08.783 --> 01:28:10.385
INTRODUCE LEGISLATION THAT WILL

01:28:10.451 --> 01:28:11.319
ADDRESS THE CONCERNS OF THE

01:28:11.386 --> 01:28:12.253
SPONSOR.

01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:13.955
BUT THE ONE THING THAT.

01:28:14.022 --> 01:28:16.758
I WILL NOT DO IS TO AGREE TO TRY

01:28:16.824 --> 01:28:17.692
AN OBSCURE FROM THE VOTER THE

01:28:17.759 --> 01:28:19.093
FACT THAT THERE ARE INDEED

01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:20.061
VOTING ON SOMETHING THAT WILL IN

01:28:20.128 --> 01:28:20.928
FACT.

01:28:20.995 --> 01:28:22.697
INCREASE TAXES AND I DON'T THINK

01:28:22.764 --> 01:28:23.798
YOU SHOULD.

01:28:23.865 --> 01:28:24.899
TOO AND LASTLY I'D LIKE TO

01:28:24.966 --> 01:28:26.134
ADDRESS SOMETHING THAT HAD BEEN

01:28:26.200 --> 01:28:27.435
BROUGHT UP WHICH IS THE

01:28:27.502 --> 01:28:29.771
PERCEIVED DIFFICULTY OF PASSING.

01:28:29.837 --> 01:28:31.739
THESE BOND ISSUANCES ON THE

01:28:31.806 --> 01:28:32.874
BALLOT.

01:28:32.940 --> 01:28:36.511
THERE IS ANALYSIS HERE.

01:28:36.577 --> 01:28:38.012
THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS THAT YOU

01:28:38.079 --> 01:28:38.646
OF THAT -- YOU RECEIVED ON THIS

01:28:38.713 --> 01:28:40.048
BILL ALL OF THE MEASURES THAT

01:28:40.114 --> 01:28:41.549
WERE PROPOSED LAST YEAR.

01:28:41.616 --> 01:28:43.051
THAT PUT BOND INCREASES ON

01:28:43.117 --> 01:28:44.719
BALLOTS IN CALIFORNIA THERE WERE

01:28:44.786 --> 01:28:46.187
ALMOST FOUR HUNDRED OF THEM AND

01:28:46.254 --> 01:28:47.221
THE PASSAGERATE.

01:28:47.288 --> 01:28:49.657
WAS OVER 82%.

01:28:49.724 --> 01:28:51.659
SO I DON'T ACCEPT THE FACT THAT

01:28:51.726 --> 01:28:54.028
THIS IS PREVENTING OTHERWISE

01:28:54.095 --> 01:28:56.230
GOOD BOND ISSUANCES FROM PASSING

01:28:56.297 --> 01:28:57.498
AND IN FACT I THINK IF WE EVER

01:28:57.565 --> 01:28:58.733
GET TO A 100%.

01:28:58.800 --> 01:29:00.368
TAX PASSAGE RATE THAT THAT WOULD

01:29:00.435 --> 01:29:01.903
BE INDICATIVE OF A DIFFERENT

01:29:01.969 --> 01:29:04.539
PROBLEM SO I WOULD DOT URGE YOU

01:29:04.605 --> 01:29:05.506
TO EITHER VOTE NO OR LAY OFF AND

01:29:05.573 --> 01:29:06.641
GIVE US AN OPPORTUNITY TO WORK

01:29:06.708 --> 01:29:08.309
OUT SOMETHING THAT BALANCES THE

01:29:08.376 --> 01:29:09.711
NEED. TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE

01:29:09.777 --> 01:29:11.679
PROBLEMS WITHIN RAISED WITH

01:29:11.746 --> 01:29:13.781
PROTECTION OF TAXPAYERS.

01:29:13.848 --> 01:29:14.949
THE MEASURE WANT OBERNOLTE.

01:29:15.016 --> 01:29:16.250
MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS GOOD MORNING

01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:20.722
OPPOSITION AND FORTUNATELY DEBTS

BE TWO SIXTY EIGHT MEMBERS OF MR

01:29:23.024 --> 01:29:24.125
WROTE -- OBERNOLTE MENTION WE DO

01:29:24.192 --> 01:29:25.993
HAVE A LONG AND STORIED HISTORY

01:29:26.060 --> 01:29:28.062
WITH THIS CODE SECTION WE WERE

01:29:28.129 --> 01:29:29.764
THE SPONSORS OF BOTH AB EIGHT OR

01:29:29.831 --> 01:29:31.432
NINE AND AB.

01:29:31.499 --> 01:29:33.134
ONE OH FIVE AND MEMBERS AS EVEN

MISTER WERE NORTH YOU MENTION WE

01:29:34.502 --> 01:29:36.971
UNDERSTAND THAT THIS INFORMATION

01:29:37.038 --> 01:29:39.741
CAN BE DIFFICULT TO LESS THAN A

01:29:39.807 --> 01:29:40.708
SEVENTY FIVE WORD ABOUT LABEL WE

01:29:40.775 --> 01:29:42.009
TO HAVE WORKED WITH CASH AND

01:29:42.076 --> 01:29:42.910
OTHERS.

01:29:42.977 --> 01:29:44.512
OVER MULTIPLE YEARS OUT OF

01:29:44.579 --> 01:29:46.581
RECOGNITION ON THIS PROBLEM TO

01:29:46.647 --> 01:29:47.882
TRY AND REACH SOME SORT OF

01:29:47.949 --> 01:29:49.584
AMENDMENT IN CONCLUSION THAT

01:29:49.650 --> 01:29:51.285
WOULD ACTUALLY WORK WHILE STILL

01:29:51.352 --> 01:29:52.820
PROVIDING INFORMATION TO

THERE'S OVERTURES WERE REJECTED

ARE SOLD IN SERIES AND AREN'T

01:30:01.829 --> 01:30:03.331
SOLD EVERY YEAR IT'S VERY

01:30:03.397 --> 01:30:04.365
DIFFICULT TO GET THAT

01:30:04.432 --> 01:30:07.034
INFORMATION ON A SEVENTY FIVE OR

01:30:07.101 --> 01:30:07.935
A BALLOT LABEL.

01:30:08.002 --> 01:30:08.936
BUT AS THE ASSEMBLYMAN ALSO

01:30:09.003 --> 01:30:10.471
MENTIONED JUST BECAUSE SOMETHING

01:30:10.538 --> 01:30:17.411
IS DIFFICULT DOES NOT MEAN IT IS

01:30:17.478 --> 01:30:18.880
IMPOSSIBLE.

01:30:18.946 --> 01:30:21.182
CAL TAX -- AS THE SOME WOMEN

01:30:21.249 --> 01:30:21.749

THE BALLOT IN THE LAST ELECTION

01:30:25.453 --> 01:30:27.155
CYCLE SINCE THESE BILLS A BAN IN

01:30:27.221 --> 01:30:27.588
PLACE WERE PROOF.

01:30:27.655 --> 01:30:29.724
THAT IS AN 82% PASSAGE RATE IT'S

01:30:29.791 --> 01:30:31.993
NOT AS IF THESE DON'T PASS WITH

01:30:32.059 --> 01:30:35.163
THAT REQUIRED TRANSPARENCY

01:30:35.229 --> 01:30:38.099
INFORMATION IN PLACE -- WE DO

01:30:38.166 --> 01:30:39.500

01:30:41.736 --> 01:30:43.204
LEVEL IN A MANNER THAT MAKES

01:30:43.271 --> 01:30:44.672
SENSE TO VOTERS.

01:30:44.739 --> 01:30:46.073
AND MAYBE LISTEN IF WE CAN

01:30:46.140 --> 01:30:49.110
EXPLAIN THE NUANCES OF A BOND

MEASURE IN SEVENTY FIVE RATES

01:30:50.244 --> 01:30:52.213
MAYBE WE SHOULD INCREASE THE

01:30:52.280 --> 01:30:53.281
NUMBER OF PORTS.

01:30:53.347 --> 01:30:55.650
MAYBE WE SHOULD LIMIT THE

01:30:55.716 --> 01:30:57.185
SEVENTY FIVE WORD BALLOT LABEL

01:30:57.251 --> 01:30:58.586
DIGEST THE RATE DURATION AND

01:30:58.653 --> 01:30:59.987

GOES TO SUPPORT.

01:31:06.227 --> 01:31:07.962
PUT THAT SOMEWHERE ELSE.

01:31:08.029 --> 01:31:08.996
BECAUSE LISTEN THESE MEASURES

01:31:09.063 --> 01:31:11.499

UNDERSTAND.

01:31:51.572 --> 01:31:52.907
YOU'RE ADVOCATING.

FOR TAX RATE INFORMATION.

01:32:02.917 --> 01:32:04.151
I THINK THAT'S A REASONABLE.

01:32:04.218 --> 01:32:05.620
APPROXIMATION OF WHAT YOU'RE

01:32:05.686 --> 01:32:07.421
ADVOCATING FOR MY QUESTION IS

01:32:07.488 --> 01:32:08.556
AROUND.

01:32:08.623 --> 01:32:09.924
THE SUGGESTION THAT A VOTER

01:32:09.991 --> 01:32:11.292
WOULD NOT HAVE ANY SENSE THAT

01:32:11.359 --> 01:32:12.493
THEY'RE VOTING ON A PARCEL TAX

01:32:12.560 --> 01:32:14.262
AT ALL.

01:32:14.328 --> 01:32:16.097
IN THAT THE DESCRIPTION HERE

01:32:16.163 --> 01:32:17.932
WHICH TO ME LOOKS LIKE A FAIRLY

01:32:17.999 --> 01:32:19.533
COMMON DESCRIPTION IN THE

01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:21.702
DESCRIPTION ITSELF IT SAYS RENEW

01:32:21.769 --> 01:32:23.871
AN EXPIRING PARCEL TAX.

01:32:23.938 --> 01:32:25.273
I THINK JUST ON THE NATURAL

01:32:25.339 --> 01:32:26.507
THESE FISCAL MEASURES THAT GO

01:32:26.574 --> 01:32:29.810
BEFORE VOTERS WILL INDICATE THAT

01:32:29.877 --> 01:32:31.579
THERE IS A TAX IN PLAY.

01:32:31.646 --> 01:32:32.546
THAT THERE IS A QUESTION BEFORE

01:32:32.613 --> 01:32:35.416
THE VOTERS REGARDING A NEW TAX

01:32:35.483 --> 01:32:38.286
OR RENEWAL OF EXPIRING TAX.

01:32:38.352 --> 01:32:39.120
BUT FOR THAT DETAILED

01:32:39.186 --> 01:32:40.788
INFORMATION GO TO THE VOTER

01:32:40.855 --> 01:32:43.457
GUIDE. TO ME THAT MEETS THE

01:32:43.524 --> 01:32:45.993
THRESHOLD FOR TRANSPARENCY.

01:32:46.060 --> 01:32:47.862
AND DISCLOSURE THAT A VOTER IS

01:32:47.929 --> 01:32:49.163
IN FACT VOTING ON A TAX AND IF

01:32:49.230 --> 01:32:50.531
THEY WANT DETAILED INFORMATION

01:32:50.598 --> 01:32:51.766
TO GO TO THE VOTER GUIDE SO I

01:32:51.832 --> 01:32:53.901
APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR ENGAGEMENT

01:32:53.968 --> 01:32:54.835
ON THIS I THINK IT'S A

01:32:54.902 --> 01:32:56.804
REASONABLE -- AMENDMENT -- THAT

01:32:56.871 --> 01:32:59.040
THE AUTHOR IS WILLING TO TAKE IN

01:32:59.106 --> 01:33:07.114
WITH THAT I WOULD MOVE THE BILL.

01:33:07.181 --> 01:33:08.716
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR.

01:33:08.783 --> 01:33:10.618
I'M JUST CURIOUS.

01:33:10.685 --> 01:33:12.186
MR VERNAL TO SUGGESTION THIS

01:33:12.253 --> 01:33:14.188
MEASURE AFFECTS TAX RATES.

01:33:14.255 --> 01:33:17.058
WHY WAS UNACCEPTABLE?

01:33:17.124 --> 01:33:18.125
SO IT MAY OR MAY NOT BECAUSE FOR

01:33:18.192 --> 01:33:19.927
EXAMPLE IF YOU ARE RENEWING AN

01:33:19.994 --> 01:33:22.029
EXISTING PARCEL TAX AND NOT

01:33:22.096 --> 01:33:23.531
INCREASING AND MIGHT BE EXACTLY

01:33:23.597 --> 01:33:26.167
THE SAME OR COULD EVEN BE LOWER --

01:33:26.233 --> 01:33:28.736
YOU'RE NOT A IT'S NOT A FACTOR

01:33:28.803 --> 01:33:31.272
BUT WELL IT'S LOWERING YES THAT

01:33:31.339 --> 01:33:32.273
AFFECTS OF BUT IF YOU'RE JUST

01:33:32.340 --> 01:33:35.743
RENEWING AN EXISTING ONE NOT

01:33:35.810 --> 01:33:37.078
CHANGE YET IT DOESN'T AFFECTED.

01:33:37.144 --> 01:33:39.146
IN ADDITION FOR BONDS.

01:33:39.213 --> 01:33:40.348
DIFFERENT CITIES HAVE DIFFERENT

01:33:40.414 --> 01:33:42.116
POLICIES FOR EXAMPLE -- IN SAN

01:33:42.183 --> 01:33:43.417
FRANCISCO WE HAVE A BINDING

01:33:43.484 --> 01:33:46.587
POLICY THAT WE DO NOT ISSUE.

01:33:46.654 --> 01:33:48.589
NEW EVEN IF VOTERS COMMEMORATIVE

01:33:48.656 --> 01:33:50.057
VOTERS APPROVE A BOND.

01:33:50.124 --> 01:33:52.360
THOSE BONDS DON'T EVER HAVE TO

01:33:52.426 --> 01:33:53.995
BE ISSUED RIGHT OF DID THE VOTER

01:33:54.061 --> 01:33:55.563
APPROVAL SIMPLY AUTHORIZES THE

01:33:55.629 --> 01:33:56.731
SALE OF THE BONDS AND THE BONDS

01:33:56.797 --> 01:33:57.999
ARE NEVER SOLD WHICH

01:33:58.065 --> 01:33:59.767
OCCASIONALLY DOES HAPPEN.

01:33:59.834 --> 01:34:01.135
THAN NOT BEEN THERE'S NO IMPACT

01:34:01.202 --> 01:34:02.636
ON ANYTHING SO SOMETIMES YOU

01:34:02.703 --> 01:34:04.638
HAVE A BOND IT'S AUTHORIZED AND

01:34:04.705 --> 01:34:07.108
THEN EITHER IT'S ONLY PARTIALLY

01:34:07.174 --> 01:34:09.010
SOLD OR NOT SOLD AT ALL.

01:34:09.076 --> 01:34:10.811
AND SOMETIMES I'LL EXAMINE CISCO

01:34:10.878 --> 01:34:12.546
WE HAVE A POLICY THAT WE DO NOT

01:34:12.613 --> 01:34:14.648
SELL AND ISSUE A NEW BOND.

01:34:14.715 --> 01:34:16.617
UNLESS WE ARE RETIRING AND

01:34:16.684 --> 01:34:18.185
EQUIVALENT BOND -- AND SO IT

01:34:18.252 --> 01:34:19.687
DOES NOT AFFECT PEOPLE'S TAX

01:34:19.754 --> 01:34:21.522
RATES AT ALL IN THE TO POLICY

01:34:21.589 --> 01:34:23.024
THE CITY I I'M I DON'T KNOW IF

01:34:23.090 --> 01:34:23.891
THERE ARE OTHER CITIES THAT DO

01:34:23.958 --> 01:34:26.894
THAT I BELIEVE THERE ARE -- SO

01:34:26.961 --> 01:34:28.929
THAT'S WHY -- USING THE WORD A

01:34:28.996 --> 01:34:35.436
FAX IT WE THINK IS MISLEADING.

01:34:35.503 --> 01:34:36.037
I THINK IT'S BETTER TO TO SAY

01:34:36.103 --> 01:34:37.538
FOR TAX INFORMATION AND MAKES IT

01:34:37.605 --> 01:34:39.840
CRYSTAL CLEAR THAT THE TAX

01:34:39.907 --> 01:34:41.609
APPLIES HERE -- TAX INFORMATION

01:34:41.675 --> 01:34:42.810
SEE THE VOTER HANDBOOK AND I

01:34:42.877 --> 01:34:43.677
UNDERSTAND THAT YOU KNOW THE

01:34:43.744 --> 01:34:45.246
ARGUMENT IS THAT WILL NOT

01:34:45.312 --> 01:34:46.580
EVERYONE GOES AND READ THE VOTER

01:34:46.647 --> 01:34:47.982
HANDBOOK BUT THE WHOLE POINT OF

01:34:48.049 --> 01:34:48.983
THE VOTER HABITATS WE PUT THE

01:34:49.050 --> 01:34:49.517
TAXED.

01:34:49.583 --> 01:34:52.119
OF OF BALLOT MEASURES WE PUT ALL

01:34:52.186 --> 01:34:52.787
SORTS OF INFORMATION IN THERE SO

01:34:52.853 --> 01:34:53.687
THE PEOPLE CAN ACCESS THAT

01:34:53.754 --> 01:34:54.221
INFORMATION WE CAN'T FORCE

01:34:54.288 --> 01:34:55.756
PEOPLE. TO DO IT BUT BUT THEY

01:34:55.823 --> 01:34:58.292
SAY THAT BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE ARE

01:34:58.359 --> 01:34:58.893
GOING TO READ THE HANDBOOK.

01:34:58.959 --> 01:35:00.227
WE SHOULD THEREFORE BE PUTTING

01:35:00.294 --> 01:35:02.430
ALL THIS INFORMATION IN THE

01:35:02.496 --> 01:35:02.997
SEVENTY FIVE WORDS IN EITHER

01:35:03.064 --> 01:35:04.698
CREATE AN OUTRAGEOUS SITUATION

01:35:04.765 --> 01:35:06.867
LIKE THIS OR A SITUATION WHERE

01:35:06.934 --> 01:35:08.135
YOU'RE JUST MAKING AN EXCEPTION

01:35:08.202 --> 01:35:09.403
HARD TO EVEN DESCRIBE A SIMPLE

01:35:09.470 --> 01:35:10.304
MEASURE.

01:35:10.371 --> 01:35:10.905
I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S A

01:35:10.971 --> 01:35:13.541
SOLUTION I THINK THIS IS A GOOD

01:35:13.607 --> 01:35:15.543
ACCOMMODATION THE METAL.

01:35:15.609 --> 01:35:19.947
THANK YOU SENATE I'M AS MR OVER

01:35:20.014 --> 01:35:21.682
MULTI I'M JUST.

01:35:21.749 --> 01:35:23.584
I'M JUST CURIOUS YOU KNOW WHEN

01:35:23.651 --> 01:35:25.086
IT COMES -- TO WHEN MY COLLEAGUE

01:35:25.152 --> 01:35:26.620
MISTER MALL AND JUST SAID SEEMS

01:35:26.687 --> 01:35:27.354
LIKE THE COMPROMISE IS WORKED

01:35:27.421 --> 01:35:27.855
OUT BY THE CHAIR IN THIS

01:35:27.922 --> 01:35:28.789
COMMITTEE IS RELATIVELY CLOSE TO

01:35:28.856 --> 01:35:30.324
WHAT YOU'RE ASKING FOR SEE VOTER

01:35:30.391 --> 01:35:31.992
GUIDE FOR TAX RATE INFORMATION.

01:35:32.059 --> 01:35:32.626
AGAIN JUST GOING TO LOVE IT WHY

01:35:32.693 --> 01:35:34.328
IS THAT NOT SUFFICIENT WHY DOES

01:35:34.395 --> 01:35:36.497
IT HAVE TO INCREASE WISE HAVE TO

01:35:36.564 --> 01:35:37.832
BE AFFECTS WHAT YOU KNOW WHY IT

01:35:37.898 --> 01:35:39.333
WHY DO YOU BELIEVE THAT ISN'T

01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:40.668
CLEAR ENOUGH FOR VOTERS. TO

01:35:40.734 --> 01:35:43.304
REASONABLY DISCERN THAT THERE'S

01:35:43.370 --> 01:35:46.207
GOING TO BE SOME TYPE OF IMPACT --

01:35:46.273 --> 01:35:47.541
TO A TAX RATE OR TO TAXES BY BY

01:35:47.608 --> 01:35:50.077
THE PASSAGE OF THAT THAT OF THAT

01:35:50.144 --> 01:35:50.744
MEASURE.

01:35:50.811 --> 01:35:51.912
I THINK IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT

01:35:51.979 --> 01:35:53.848
THAT THE VOTER RECOGNIZE THAT

01:35:53.914 --> 01:35:55.449
THERE'S GOOD AND BAD IN THE

01:35:55.516 --> 01:35:56.550
PROPOSITION.

01:35:56.617 --> 01:35:58.152
THE GOOD IS THAT WE'RE GOING TO

01:35:58.219 --> 01:35:59.620
ISSUE BONDS AND DO ALL OF THIS

01:35:59.687 --> 01:36:00.654
GOOD STUFF BUILT A FIRE STATION

01:36:00.721 --> 01:36:02.456
OR WHATEVER IT IS AND THE BAD IS

01:36:02.523 --> 01:36:03.924
THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO

01:36:03.991 --> 01:36:05.659
INCREASE PROPERTY TAXES TO DO IT.

01:36:05.726 --> 01:36:07.328
SO IF YOU JUST SAY SEE VOTER

01:36:07.394 --> 01:36:08.996
GUIDE FOR TAX RATE INFORMATION

01:36:09.063 --> 01:36:10.965
DOESN'T CONVEY THE IMPRESSION

01:36:11.031 --> 01:36:14.702
THAT THERE IS A PRICE TO BE PAID --

01:36:14.768 --> 01:36:16.003
SO THAT'S WHY I DON'T THINK IT'S

01:36:16.070 --> 01:36:18.672
UNREASONABLE TO SAY AFFECTS TAX

01:36:18.739 --> 01:36:19.740
RATES.

01:36:19.807 --> 01:36:21.308
AND OF THE AUTHORED I HAD A

01:36:21.375 --> 01:36:22.476
DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS OF MY

01:36:22.543 --> 01:36:25.112
RESPONSE TO THE CRITICISM OF

01:36:25.179 --> 01:36:26.280
WELL SOME OF THEM DON'T.

01:36:26.347 --> 01:36:28.215
WAS WILL FIND THAT'S GREAT LET'S

01:36:28.282 --> 01:36:29.583
JUST PUT WILL SPLIT IT WILL SAY

01:36:29.650 --> 01:36:31.652
IF IT AFFECTS TAX RATE YOU SAY

01:36:31.719 --> 01:36:32.920
THIS MEASURE AFFECTS TAX RATES

01:36:32.987 --> 01:36:34.355
SEE VOTER GUIDE.

01:36:34.421 --> 01:36:35.222
AND IF IT DOESN'T YOU JUST SAFE

01:36:35.289 --> 01:36:36.657
YOU SEE VOTER GUIDE FOR

01:36:36.724 --> 01:36:38.392
INFORMATION HE'S EASILY SOLVED

01:36:38.459 --> 01:36:39.894
BUT THAT WAS ACCEPTABLE EITHER.

01:36:39.960 --> 01:36:41.929
AND AND JUST SO FOLKS KNOW I TRY

01:36:41.996 --> 01:36:44.165
TO WORK WITH -- MISTER WHEN ALL

01:36:44.231 --> 01:36:50.938
THE ON THIS -- IS MEASURE IT MAY

01:36:51.005 --> 01:36:52.273
AFFECT TAX RATES SEE VOTER GUIDE

01:36:52.339 --> 01:36:53.374
FOR INFORMATION AND AND THAT WAS.

01:36:53.440 --> 01:36:55.543
REJECTED -- SO WE WE TRIED ALSO

01:36:55.609 --> 01:36:57.011
SPEAK MORE TO THAT AT THE END --

01:36:57.077 --> 01:36:59.013
BUT THIS IS THE THE FINAL RESULT

01:36:59.079 --> 01:37:00.481
THAT WE ENDED UP AT WELL I I

01:37:00.548 --> 01:37:01.348
APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT YOU TO

01:37:01.415 --> 01:37:02.183
INVESTIGATION AND OTHERS A LOT

01:37:02.249 --> 01:37:03.217
OF RESPECT BETWEEN YOU TWO AND

01:37:03.284 --> 01:37:04.652
AS A LOT OF RESPECT FROM THE

01:37:04.718 --> 01:37:05.452
MEMBERS ON THIS COMMITTEE FOR

THAT MAJORITY REPUBLICAN THREE

01:37:12.359 --> 01:37:12.893
REPUBLICANS TO DEMOCRATS AND

01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:14.295
THEY CAME TO ME VERY WORRIED --

01:37:14.361 --> 01:37:15.429
THIS LAST YEAR THAT THEY WERE

01:37:15.496 --> 01:37:16.564
GOING TO HAVE THE VOTES THAT

01:37:16.630 --> 01:37:18.098
THEY'RE GOING TO NEED.

01:37:18.165 --> 01:37:20.534
TO PASS A MEASURE TO ALLOW THEM

01:37:20.601 --> 01:37:22.303
TO BE TO TO BUILD A NEW LIBRARY.

01:37:22.369 --> 01:37:23.938
ALSO THE AFTER MY SUPPORTERS I

01:37:24.004 --> 01:37:24.705
SUPPORTED IT AND YOU KNOW DID

01:37:24.772 --> 01:37:25.940
WHATEVER WE COULD TO TO GET THE

01:37:26.006 --> 01:37:27.141
INFORMATION OUT THERE BUT

01:37:27.208 --> 01:37:29.610
ULTIMATELY -- WHILE IT WAS

01:37:29.677 --> 01:37:31.779
SEEMINGLY PROMISING ON ELECTION

01:37:31.845 --> 01:37:32.980
NIGHT THE THE MEASURE ENDED UP

01:37:33.047 --> 01:37:35.382
FAILING -- TO REACH THE

01:37:35.449 --> 01:37:36.584
THRESHOLD AND NEEDED TO REACH

01:37:36.650 --> 01:37:39.520
OUT TO GET THE SUPPORT -- TO

01:37:39.587 --> 01:37:45.826
BUILD THE NEW LIBRARY -- INSEL.

01:37:45.893 --> 01:37:47.094
I I DO I DO FIND THAT ESPECIALLY

01:37:47.161 --> 01:37:47.728
WHEN IT COMES TO A LOCAL ISSUE

01:37:47.795 --> 01:37:48.395
THAT THESE.

01:37:48.462 --> 01:37:49.697
THE VERBIAGE AND WHAT IS THERE

01:37:49.763 --> 01:37:50.698
AND WHAT IS NOT THERE REALLY

01:37:50.764 --> 01:37:51.899
TENS OF FACT AND IMPACT THE

01:37:51.966 --> 01:37:54.034
OUTCOME AND WE'RE ALL BUSY WE

01:37:54.101 --> 01:37:56.337
ALL OF A LOT OF THINGS TO DO --

01:37:56.403 --> 01:37:57.204
I THINK IT'S GOOD FOR

01:37:57.271 --> 01:37:58.806
INFORMATION TO BE THERE BUT

01:37:58.872 --> 01:38:00.040
INFORMATION IS BE CLEAR NEEDS TO

01:38:00.107 --> 01:38:01.709
BE CONCISE BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE

01:38:01.775 --> 01:38:03.244
JUST GOING.

01:38:03.310 --> 01:38:04.712
TO REALLY KINDA HIT REAL QUICK

01:38:04.778 --> 01:38:05.779
AND MAKE A DECISION RIGHT THEN

01:38:05.846 --> 01:38:06.780
AND THERE IS THIS WHAT I WANT IS

01:38:06.847 --> 01:38:09.083
THIS WHEN I'M WILLING TO TO PAY

01:38:09.149 --> 01:38:10.517
FOR IT -- AS LONG AS IT'S

01:38:10.584 --> 01:38:12.286
REASONABLY CLEAR THAT THERE'S

01:38:12.353 --> 01:38:14.221
GONNA BE SOME TYPE OF AN IMPACT --

01:38:14.288 --> 01:38:16.156
WHEN IT COMES TO TAX RATES I

01:38:16.223 --> 01:38:16.724
THINK IT'S?

01:38:16.790 --> 01:38:18.592
IT'S IMPORTANT I TO CLEAN THAT

01:38:18.659 --> 01:38:20.094
UP AS MUCH AS WE POSSIBLY CAN

01:38:20.160 --> 01:38:21.428
WHILE PROVIDING THE INFORMATION

01:38:21.495 --> 01:38:22.329
SO THAT PEOPLE.

01:38:22.396 --> 01:38:23.464
IF THEY ARE INTERESTED CAN

01:38:23.530 --> 01:38:26.066
UNDERSTAND HEY THIS IS WHAT THIS

01:38:26.133 --> 01:38:26.700
IS WHAT I'M IN FOR AND THIS IS

01:38:26.767 --> 01:38:28.836
HOW IT'S GONNA SPECIFICALLY

01:38:28.902 --> 01:38:30.070
IMPACT ME.

01:38:30.137 --> 01:38:31.138
YOU KNOW I I KNOW YOU KIND OF

01:38:31.205 --> 01:38:32.039
QUALIFIED TAX IS A BAD THING.

01:38:32.106 --> 01:38:33.407
YOU KNOW IF I COULD PAY TWENTY

01:38:33.474 --> 01:38:36.877
MORE DOLLARS -- YOU KNOW A MONTH

01:38:36.944 --> 01:38:37.678
TO BUILD A NEW LIBRARY OR CURE

01:38:37.745 --> 01:38:38.979
CANCER WHATEVER IT IS I'M MORE

01:38:39.046 --> 01:38:41.582
THAN HAPPY TO DO THAT -- AND I

01:38:41.649 --> 01:38:42.182
DON'T NECESSARILY SEE THAT'S

01:38:42.249 --> 01:38:43.250
ABOUT THAT BECAUSE I THINK IT'S

01:38:43.317 --> 01:38:44.952
ALL ON US TO PAY FOR THE TYPE OF

01:38:45.019 --> 01:38:46.287
SOCIETY THAT WE WANT TO LIVE IN.

01:38:46.353 --> 01:38:51.158
BUT IT SEEMS AT THIS POINT THAT.

01:38:51.225 --> 01:38:52.860
IT'S REASONABLE BUT I WOULD

01:38:52.926 --> 01:38:54.395
ENCOURAGE CONTINUE TO WORK

01:38:54.461 --> 01:38:56.297
TOGETHER GOT A LOT OF A LOT OF

01:38:56.363 --> 01:38:58.399
PRECIADO -- FOR WHAT WE'RE

01:38:58.465 --> 01:38:59.500
TALKING ABOUT AND HOW WE'RE

01:38:59.566 --> 01:39:01.201
GOING ABOUT IT AND I AND I THINK

01:39:01.268 --> 01:39:02.002
THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO HAVE AN

01:39:02.069 --> 01:39:03.437
OPPORTUNITY TO TO LOOK AT A LOT

01:39:03.504 --> 01:39:06.006
OF DIFFERENT EXAMPLES -- BUT IF

01:39:06.073 --> 01:39:07.875
THERE'S MORE WORK TO BE DONE IN

01:39:07.941 --> 01:39:09.510
A SOMETHING WOULD LIKE TO SEE.

01:39:09.576 --> 01:39:10.344
THANK YOU.

01:39:10.411 --> 01:39:11.679
ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR

01:39:11.745 --> 01:39:12.780
COMMENTS AND COLLEAGUES.

01:39:12.846 --> 01:39:14.815
I HAVE A MOTION AS FOR ME THE

01:39:14.882 --> 01:39:15.683
SECOND.

01:39:15.749 --> 01:39:19.320

THOUGHTFUL CONVERSATION ON ON

01:39:24.525 --> 01:39:26.827
THIS ISSUE IT -- I DO JUST WANT

01:39:26.894 --> 01:39:27.828
A TWO THINGS FIRST OF ALL

01:39:27.895 --> 01:39:28.829
BECAUSE THE AUTHOR AND I'VE

01:39:28.896 --> 01:39:30.130
ALREADY COMMITTED WE'RE GONNA

01:39:30.197 --> 01:39:33.400
CONTINUE. TO TO TO TALK AND SEE --

01:39:33.467 --> 01:39:36.003
IF THERE IS A AWAY BUT I THINK

01:39:36.070 --> 01:39:36.904
ON A CAT CAN NEVER GUARANTEE

01:39:36.970 --> 01:39:41.709
RESULTS -- BUT I WILL SAY THAT

01:39:41.775 --> 01:39:42.876
THE THE CHAIR.

01:39:42.943 --> 01:39:45.245
PUSH US OUT OF OUR COMFORT ZONE.

01:39:45.312 --> 01:39:46.780
RIGHT AND THAT MEASURE THE

01:39:46.847 --> 01:39:47.381
TERRIBLE ATTACHED -- WE WERE

01:39:47.448 --> 01:39:51.151
INITIALLY VERY RESISTANT TO WHAT

01:39:51.218 --> 01:39:54.121
THE GENERAL MOTORING.

01:39:54.188 --> 01:39:54.722
HI CAN ATTEST AND THE CHECK.

01:39:54.788 --> 01:39:55.689
AND FOR THE CHAIR AND I WE WE

01:39:55.756 --> 01:39:56.557
WENT BACK AND FORTH AND WHAT I

01:39:56.623 --> 01:39:58.125
THINK WE CAME TO A GOOD.

01:39:58.192 --> 01:40:00.060
COMPROMISE AND I APPRECIATE THAT

01:40:00.127 --> 01:40:00.994
AND BY ONE OF THOSE A REFERENCE

01:40:01.061 --> 01:40:04.698
MADE TO SPECIAL INTERESTS AND I

01:40:04.765 --> 01:40:05.366
DON'T AS MUCH AS I LOVE THAT AND

01:40:05.432 --> 01:40:07.034
I'VE I'VE HAD MY DISAGREEMENTS

01:40:07.101 --> 01:40:07.868
WITH THOUGHT.

01:40:07.935 --> 01:40:09.403
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN CALIFORNIA

01:40:09.470 --> 01:40:11.572
PARTICULARLY AROUND THE ISSUE OF

01:40:11.638 --> 01:40:12.406
HOUSING.

01:40:12.473 --> 01:40:14.975
TIME TO TIME -- BUT BUT BUT BUT

01:40:15.042 --> 01:40:16.343
OUR CITIES AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS

01:40:16.410 --> 01:40:17.978
AND COUNTIES AND SCHOOL DISTRICT

01:40:18.045 --> 01:40:19.646
I WOULD NOT DO THEM A SPECIAL

01:40:19.713 --> 01:40:21.348
INTERESTS THESE ARE.

01:40:21.415 --> 01:40:27.921
PUBLIC ENTITIES THAT WE A LOCKED

01:40:27.988 --> 01:40:29.656
TO EDUCATE OUR KIDS.

01:40:29.723 --> 01:40:30.457
TO NOT PROVIDE WATER AND SEWER

01:40:30.524 --> 01:40:31.892
SERVICES TO KEEP THE LIBRARIES

01:40:31.959 --> 01:40:33.360
OPEN AND KEEP THE FIRE STATIONS

01:40:33.427 --> 01:40:35.329
OPEN -- AND SO I THINK THEY ARE

01:40:35.396 --> 01:40:36.296
PART OF OUR PUBLIC FAMILY AND I

01:40:36.363 --> 01:40:36.897
THINK THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO

01:40:36.964 --> 01:40:38.031
RAISE REVENUE AND IT'S ALREADY

01:40:38.098 --> 01:40:38.732
HARD ENOUGH.

01:40:38.799 --> 01:40:39.933
BOB WE SHOULDN'T BE MAKING IT

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.669
HARDER -- AND I RESPECT WESTERN

01:40:42.736 --> 01:40:43.170
AGO.

01:40:43.237 --> 01:40:44.405
THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- AND AND

01:40:44.471 --> 01:40:46.840
THANK YOU TO TO THE FOLKS IN

01:40:46.907 --> 01:40:48.242
FAVOR THE FOLKS IN SUPPORT.

01:40:48.308 --> 01:40:49.877
OF THE CONVERSATION ALSO FROM

01:40:49.943 --> 01:40:52.513
COLLEAGUES WHEN -- I HEARD ABOUT

01:40:52.579 --> 01:40:54.281
THIS BILL AND I SPOKE WITH BOTH

01:40:54.348 --> 01:40:55.315
CENTER WIENER AND AND SOME

01:40:55.382 --> 01:40:56.717
NUMBER ONE ON THE AND ENCOURAGE

01:40:56.784 --> 01:40:58.118
THEM. TO TRY TO WORK OUT A

01:40:58.185 --> 01:41:00.120
COMPROMISE AND AND REALLY HOPE

01:41:00.187 --> 01:41:03.023
THAT THEY WOULD -- AND THEN THEY

01:41:03.090 --> 01:41:04.124
CAME TO ME A COUPLE OF DAYS SO

01:41:04.191 --> 01:41:04.625
CLOSE.

01:41:04.691 --> 01:41:05.292
AND THEY CAME TO ME A COUPLE OF

01:41:05.359 --> 01:41:06.960
DAYS AGO AND SAID WE JUST CAN'T

01:41:07.027 --> 01:41:09.329
GET THERE -- AND I KNEW THEN

01:41:09.396 --> 01:41:11.765
THAT I'D HAVE TO GUIDE GET MORE

01:41:11.832 --> 01:41:14.835
INVOLVED AND AND END UP COMING

01:41:14.902 --> 01:41:15.436
TO A RESULT THAT DISAPPOINTED

01:41:15.502 --> 01:41:17.438
EVERYBODY -- AND I THINK I'VE

01:41:17.504 --> 01:41:21.442
ACCOMPLISHED THAT.

01:41:21.508 --> 01:41:22.309
BUT I THINK I THINK IT'S IT'S

01:41:22.376 --> 01:41:24.111
THE RIGHT PLACE FOR THIS BILL --

01:41:24.178 --> 01:41:25.813
YOU KNOW.

01:41:25.879 --> 01:41:28.982
I HAVE SO MUCH AFFINITY FOR THE

01:41:29.049 --> 01:41:30.617
EFFORT THAT GOES INTO PASSING

01:41:30.684 --> 01:41:32.820
PARCEL TAXES AND SCHOOL BONDS

01:41:32.886 --> 01:41:34.087
WERE THE FIRST THINGS I DID AT

01:41:34.154 --> 01:41:35.489
THE LOCAL LEVELS VOLUNTEER.

01:41:35.556 --> 01:41:37.324
AND TWO THOUSAND TEN ON A LOCAL

01:41:37.391 --> 01:41:38.926
PARCEL TAX OF THE YARD SIGN GUY

01:41:38.992 --> 01:41:39.827
THAT WAS THAT WAS WHAT I WAS IN

01:41:39.893 --> 01:41:41.628
CHARGE OF WHEN THEY WENT BACK TO

01:41:41.695 --> 01:41:42.996
RENEW THAT PARCEL TAX I WAS THEN

01:41:43.063 --> 01:41:44.031
ON THE CITY COUNCIL -- AND I CAN

01:41:44.097 --> 01:41:45.933
ENDORSE IT AND MAYBE WAS ON THE

01:41:45.999 --> 01:41:47.367
BALLOT -- AS A SIGNATORY I CAN'T

01:41:47.434 --> 01:41:48.969
RECALL AND THEN A COUPLE YEARS

01:41:49.036 --> 01:41:50.070
LATER WHEN I WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY

01:41:50.137 --> 01:41:51.305
THEY CAME TO ME AND ASK FOR MY

01:41:51.371 --> 01:41:52.372
HELP IN SUPPORTING THE BOND

01:41:52.439 --> 01:41:54.107
MEASURE -- AND I'VE SEEN THE

01:41:54.174 --> 01:41:56.243
ENDLESS HOURS FROM VOLUNTEERS IN

01:41:56.310 --> 01:41:58.412
THE COMMUNITY WHO ARE TRYING TO

01:41:58.479 --> 01:41:59.446
IMPROVE THEIR COMMUNITY FOR

01:41:59.513 --> 01:42:03.016
THEIR KIDS FOR THEIR FAMILIES.

01:42:03.083 --> 01:42:04.518
FOR THE OTHER NEIGHBORS -- AND

01:42:04.585 --> 01:42:05.786
HOW DIFFICULT THAT IS WITH A LOT

01:42:05.853 --> 01:42:06.820
OF THESE EFFORTS WITH THE TWO

01:42:06.887 --> 01:42:09.590
THIRDS THRESHOLD THAT I THINK IS

01:42:09.656 --> 01:42:12.226
UNNECESSARILY HIGH -- AND THAT I

01:42:12.292 --> 01:42:13.393
FULLY SUPPORT LOWERING -- AND I

01:42:13.460 --> 01:42:14.728
FULLY SUPPORT A CA ONE THAT I

01:42:14.795 --> 01:42:16.897
KNOW HAS BEEN INTRODUCED TO DO

01:42:16.964 --> 01:42:21.301
THAT -- BUT WHILE THE THE THE

01:42:21.368 --> 01:42:22.903
THRESHOLD IS.

01:42:22.970 --> 01:42:23.871
UNNECESSARILY HIGH AND ALLOWS A

01:42:23.937 --> 01:42:25.706
STRONG MINORITY TO DEFEAT THE

01:42:25.772 --> 01:42:27.441
WILL OF A VERY STRONG MAJORITY.

01:42:27.508 --> 01:42:28.242
I THINK IT'S CRITICALLY

01:42:28.308 --> 01:42:29.409
IMPORTANT THE LANGUAGE THAT WE

01:42:29.476 --> 01:42:30.944
HAVE ON THE BALLOT AND AND THE

01:42:31.011 --> 01:42:33.180
FACT THAT -- PROVIDING VOTERS

01:42:33.247 --> 01:42:34.982
WITH WITH USEFUL AND TRANSPARENT

01:42:35.048 --> 01:42:36.617
ACCURATE INFORMATION IN THE VERY

01:42:36.683 --> 01:42:39.486
LIMITED SPACE THAT IS AVAILABLE

01:42:39.553 --> 01:42:41.688
IS INCREDIBLY CHALLENGING -- AND

01:42:41.755 --> 01:42:42.856
THAT'S WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT

01:42:42.923 --> 01:42:44.558
THAT THE INFORMATION.

01:42:44.625 --> 01:42:45.726
IS INCLUDED IN THE VOTER GUIDE

01:42:45.792 --> 01:42:46.593
AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES

01:42:46.660 --> 01:42:48.295
IS IT TAKES A REMARKABLY

01:42:48.362 --> 01:42:49.830
COMPLICATED SITUATION.

01:42:49.897 --> 01:42:51.231
IT SAYS IT'S FULLY FLUSH THAT

01:42:51.298 --> 01:42:52.699
OUT IN THE VOTER GUIDE -- AND

THAT ALLOWS PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT

U. S. CITIZENS TO RUN FOR COUNTY

02:00:05.998 --> 02:00:07.567
CENTRAL COMMITTEE.

CURRENTLY THERE IS NO PATH TO

LEFT MIDDLE NOT EVEN ON THE

02:03:35.141 --> 02:03:37.777
SPECTRUM -- BUT WE THINK THAT

02:03:37.843 --> 02:03:39.745
THIS IS USEFUL INFORMATION FOR

02:03:39.812 --> 02:03:41.247

02:03:41.313 --> 02:03:42.848
EMPOWER PEOPLE THE BALLOT BOX

02:03:42.915 --> 02:03:45.017
MORE AND LESS SO. TO THE IMPACT

02:03:45.084 --> 02:03:47.253

02:03:58.497 --> 02:03:59.064
BEEN A PRETTY PRODUCTIVE

02:03:59.131 --> 02:04:01.133

02:04:17.583 --> 02:04:18.150
AS WE WORKED ON THE THE

02:04:18.217 --> 02:04:19.385
CALIFORNIA DISCLOSE ACT OVER THE

02:04:19.451 --> 02:04:21.720
YEARS WE'VE BEEN DOING THAT --

02:04:21.787 --> 02:04:23.222
BECAUSE THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE

02:04:23.289 --> 02:04:25.424
WANT TO KNOW THE MOST ARE WHO IS

02:04:25.491 --> 02:04:27.159
BEHIND INITIATIVES.

02:04:27.226 --> 02:04:28.260

INITIATIVES AND PEOPLE ALSO

02:04:29.395 --> 02:04:30.796
WON'T WANT TO KNOW WHO IS

SUPPORTING AND OPPOSING

02:04:31.897 --> 02:04:33.666
INITIATIVES WITH THE DISCLOSE

02:04:33.732 --> 02:04:35.234
ACT ON POLITICAL ADS WE CAN'T

02:04:35.301 --> 02:04:37.369
REQUIRE THEM TO PUT.

02:04:37.436 --> 02:04:38.637
HERE'S YOUR AT IT NOW YOU HAVE

02:04:38.704 --> 02:04:39.805
TO LIST YOUR OPPONENTS ABOUT

02:04:39.872 --> 02:04:40.940
THAT WOULD NOT BE A RECALL

02:04:41.006 --> 02:04:41.607
REASONABLE THING TO DO FOR

02:04:41.674 --> 02:04:42.441
POLITICAL ADS.

02:04:42.508 --> 02:04:44.210
BUT WE CAN PROVIDE THAT WE DO

02:04:44.276 --> 02:04:46.378
PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION AND THE

02:04:46.445 --> 02:04:47.646
BALLOT PAMPHLET.

02:04:47.713 --> 02:04:49.415
AND WE COULD PROVIDE IT ON THE

02:04:49.481 --> 02:04:52.284
BALLOT ITSELF THE BALLOT ITSELF

02:04:52.351 --> 02:04:54.520
IT IS CURRENTLY THE SEVENTY FIVE

02:04:54.587 --> 02:04:55.855
WORDS ON THE BALLOT IS A U.

02:04:55.921 --> 02:04:58.057
USEFUL CONDENSED SUMMARY.

02:04:58.123 --> 02:05:00.860
OF JUST THE THE THAT THREE OR

02:05:00.926 --> 02:05:03.863
FOUR PAGE -- OBJECTIVE ANALYSIS

02:05:03.929 --> 02:05:06.432
AND THEN THE ONE OR TWO PAGE

02:05:06.498 --> 02:05:08.334
FISCAL IMPACT STATE A STATEMENT

02:05:08.400 --> 02:05:10.569
BUT IT'S A VERY VERY CONDENSER

02:05:10.636 --> 02:05:12.371
SUMMARY THAT REALLY DOESN'T GIVE

02:05:12.438 --> 02:05:14.273
VOTERS JUST KIND OF GIVES.

02:05:14.340 --> 02:05:16.508
A REMINDER PERHAPS OB BUT THE

02:05:16.575 --> 02:05:18.043
BALLOT BUT ALSO HAS THE OTHER

02:05:18.110 --> 02:05:19.678
CRUCIAL INFORMATION OF THOSE

02:05:19.745 --> 02:05:21.447
ARGUMENTS FOR AND AGAINST AND

02:05:21.513 --> 02:05:23.382
MOST IMPORTANTLY -- WHO IS

02:05:23.449 --> 02:05:24.650
SIGNING THEM PEOPLE THAT PEOPLE

02:05:24.717 --> 02:05:26.919
TRUST ONE WAY OR THE OTHER SO WE

02:05:26.986 --> 02:05:27.620
THINK THAT IS?

02:05:27.686 --> 02:05:28.888
REALLY CRUCIAL CRUCIAL

02:05:28.954 --> 02:05:30.456
INFORMATION FOR VOTERS.

02:05:30.522 --> 02:05:32.124
I THINK THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF

02:05:32.191 --> 02:05:34.727
CONFUSION IN THE BILL ABOUT.

02:05:34.793 --> 02:05:36.362
THE AMOUNT OF SPACE THAT IT

02:05:36.428 --> 02:05:38.797
REQUIRES -- AND I CAN ACTUALLY

02:05:38.864 --> 02:05:40.099
SEE IN THE LANGUAGE.

02:05:40.165 --> 02:05:42.201
OF OF THE BILL THAT IT COULD BE

02:05:42.268 --> 02:05:44.603
CLARIFIED TO TO TO TO MAKE THIS

02:05:44.670 --> 02:05:45.304
CLEAR.

02:05:45.371 --> 02:05:47.006
THE THE CLERKS WERE CONCERNED

02:05:47.072 --> 02:05:48.507
THAT COULD THAT EACH OF THE FUND

02:05:48.574 --> 02:05:50.075
SUPPORTERS AND OPPONENTS HAD TO

02:05:50.142 --> 02:05:52.077
BE LISTED ON SEPARATE LINES.

02:05:52.144 --> 02:05:53.045
THAT IS NOT THE INTENT OF THE

02:05:53.112 --> 02:05:53.779
BILL.

02:05:53.846 --> 02:05:54.713
THE INTENT OF THE BILL IS TO

02:05:54.780 --> 02:05:56.582
GIVE FIFTEEN WORDS DESCRIBING

02:05:56.649 --> 02:05:58.517
THE SUPPORTERS FIFTEEN WORDS

02:05:58.584 --> 02:05:59.718
DESPITE DESCRIBING THE OPPONENT

02:05:59.785 --> 02:06:01.287
SO TOTAL THIRTY TWO WORDS.

02:06:01.353 --> 02:06:03.656
ON THE SEVENTY TWO WE MARK THAT

02:06:03.722 --> 02:06:06.191
UP AND THAT MEANS A MODE IN MANY

02:06:06.258 --> 02:06:08.494
CASES IT'S JUST TO ADDED LINES.

02:06:08.560 --> 02:06:10.462
AND IN MOST AND AND THE WORST WE

02:06:10.529 --> 02:06:12.364
EVER SEEN WAS THREE ADDED LINES

02:06:12.431 --> 02:06:19.672
ON IN LA COUNTY A BALLOT THAT WE

02:06:19.738 --> 02:06:25.010
ACTUALLY MOCKED UP ON SO --

02:06:25.077 --> 02:06:27.246
INITIATIVES AN AVERAGE OF TWO OR

02:06:27.313 --> 02:06:29.148
THREE LINES IT WOULD BE AT MOST

02:06:29.214 --> 02:06:30.215
THIRTY ADDITIONAL LINES.

02:06:30.282 --> 02:06:31.951
IN FACT IN MANY OF THOSE THERE'S

02:06:32.017 --> 02:06:33.519
EXTRA BLANK SPACE AT THE END SO

02:06:33.585 --> 02:06:34.420
THERE'S A VERY GOOD CHANCE THEY

02:06:34.486 --> 02:06:35.721
WOULDN'T HAVE TO PRINT ANY EXTRA

02:06:35.788 --> 02:06:37.489
PAPER AT ALL -- IN THIS CASE

02:06:37.556 --> 02:06:38.524
WHERE THEY MIGHT HAVE TO PRINT

02:06:38.590 --> 02:06:40.292
ONE EXTRA PAGE WE THINK THIS IS

02:06:40.359 --> 02:06:41.527
INFORMATION THAT BE.

02:06:41.593 --> 02:06:43.429

WORDS WILL TAKE UP ON THE BALLOT

02:12:42.120 --> 02:12:44.122
IN JUST A POINT ON THAT -- WE

02:12:44.189 --> 02:12:45.057
HAVE CAN'T WORDS BASED ON

02:12:45.123 --> 02:12:47.125
ELECTION CODE SECTION NINE WHICH

02:12:47.192 --> 02:12:48.460
SAYS THAT PROPER NOUNS ARE

02:12:48.527 --> 02:12:50.295
CONSIDERED ONE WORD SO.

02:12:50.362 --> 02:12:53.732
EVERY NAME -- MOST OF A TITLE.

02:12:53.799 --> 02:12:54.833
EVEN IF IT'S MADE UP OF MULTIPLE

02:12:54.900 --> 02:12:56.068
WORDS WOULD YOU CONSIDER ONE

02:12:56.134 --> 02:12:57.569
WORD UNDER THAT SO.

02:12:57.636 --> 02:12:58.804
WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE FACT

02:12:58.870 --> 02:13:00.939
THAT THIRTY WORDS ARE THIRTY SHE

02:13:01.006 --> 02:13:01.573
WORDS MIGHT NOT BE THIRTY TWO

02:13:01.640 --> 02:13:02.040
WORDS.

02:13:02.107 --> 02:13:03.909
AT THE ADDED COST APPROVING

02:13:03.975 --> 02:13:05.610
TRANSLATING ADDITIONAL TEXT.

02:13:05.677 --> 02:13:06.578
WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE COSTS

02:13:06.645 --> 02:13:07.746
ASSOCIATED WITH PRINTING MORE

02:13:07.813 --> 02:13:09.514
BALLOT CARDS IF THE ADDITIONAL

02:13:09.581 --> 02:13:11.249
TAX CREATES A NEED FOR MORE

02:13:11.316 --> 02:13:12.651
BALLOT CARDS.

02:13:12.718 --> 02:13:13.285
WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE COSTS

02:13:13.352 --> 02:13:15.153
ASSOCIATED WITH THAT MAILING

02:13:15.220 --> 02:13:16.521
VOTE BY MAIL BALLOTS BOTH

02:13:16.588 --> 02:13:18.056
MAILING TO THE VOTERS.

02:13:18.123 --> 02:13:20.158
AND OF COURSE NOW THE POSTAGE

02:13:20.225 --> 02:13:21.927
PAID RETURN COSTS OF RECEIVING

02:13:21.993 --> 02:13:23.895
BALLOTS BACK FROM VOTERS IF THE

02:13:23.962 --> 02:13:25.564
ADDITIONAL TAX CREATES THE NEED

02:13:25.630 --> 02:13:26.365
FOR MORE ABOUT CARDS.

02:13:26.431 --> 02:13:31.103
AND WE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT HOW

02:13:31.169 --> 02:13:31.703
THE BILL MIGHT POLITICIZE THE

02:13:31.770 --> 02:13:32.504
BALLOT.

02:13:32.571 --> 02:13:33.638
HOW VOTERS MIGHT BE CONFUSED AS

02:13:33.705 --> 02:13:34.239
TO WHY THIS DOESN'T EXTEND TO

02:13:34.306 --> 02:13:34.606
LOCAL MEASURES?

02:13:34.673 --> 02:13:35.273
AND THE NEED FOR SPECIFICITY ON

02:13:35.340 --> 02:13:35.841
THE NAY ALLEN HOW THE NAME

02:13:35.907 --> 02:13:37.743
SHOULD BE PRESENTED ON THE

02:13:37.809 --> 02:13:39.211
BALLOT IF THIS WERE TO PASS.

02:13:39.277 --> 02:13:40.212
BUT BECAUSE STATE ELECTIONS ARE

02:13:40.278 --> 02:13:42.114
NOT REIMBURSABLE ELECTIONS

02:13:42.180 --> 02:13:42.714
MANDATES HAVE NOT BEEN FUNDED

02:13:42.781 --> 02:13:43.782
FOR SOMETIME.

02:13:43.849 --> 02:13:45.083
WE'RE FEARFUL THAT THE CASA

02:13:45.150 --> 02:13:47.819
SENATOR ASSISTED WITH SIX AT

02:13:47.886 --> 02:13:48.453
THIRTY SIX WILL BE BORNE BY THE

02:13:48.520 --> 02:13:49.654
COUNTIES.

02:13:49.721 --> 02:13:51.390
HOWEVER WE HAVE AS I SAID BEEN

02:13:51.456 --> 02:13:52.324

WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING

02:13:56.495 --> 02:13:57.429
HOW WE MIGHT MITIGATE OR

02:13:57.496 --> 02:13:58.997
ELIMINATE ALL OF THESE ISSUES.

02:13:59.064 --> 02:14:02.100

02:14:12.511 --> 02:14:13.412
WOULD.

02:14:13.478 --> 02:14:15.180
INCREASE VOTING LINES AND MAKE

02:14:15.247 --> 02:14:17.282
THE TIMES IN THE POLLS LONGER

02:14:17.349 --> 02:14:18.417
WHICH WOULD CREATE EVEN MORE

02:14:18.483 --> 02:14:20.452
LINE LONG LINES BECAUSE OF THE

02:14:20.519 --> 02:14:22.721
LENGTH OF OF THE BALLOT AND

02:14:22.788 --> 02:14:24.556
PEOPLE TRYING TO READ ALL THE

02:14:24.623 --> 02:14:26.625

OBSERVED THAT THE THE ENLARGED

02:14:43.308 --> 02:14:44.910
TO CARD BALLOT CREATED A LOT OF

02:14:44.976 --> 02:14:46.912
CONFUSION BETWEEN WITH THE POLL

02:14:57.889 --> 02:14:59.391

THAT THE ELECTORATE READ THEM.

02:25:28.352 --> 02:25:30.788
STUDY THEM AND THEN VOTE ON

02:25:30.855 --> 02:25:35.093
THEIR CONSCIENCE -- BECAUSE WE

02:26:09.093 --> 02:26:10.294
WE WE WE DO NOT EVEN HERE WHEN

WITH TIME.

02:26:13.731 --> 02:26:14.565
BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THESE

02:26:14.632 --> 02:26:16.033
STATEWIDE INITIATIVE EVEN LOCAL

02:26:16.100 --> 02:26:18.002
MEASURES IT IS INCREDIBLY

02:26:18.069 --> 02:26:19.537
IMPORTANT FOR ELECTED TO GO AND

02:26:19.604 --> 02:26:21.038
DIG AND FIND OUT AS MUCH

02:26:21.105 --> 02:26:22.507
INFORMATION AS THEY CAN.

02:26:22.573 --> 02:26:24.275
THE BILL TO MAKE A DECISION AND

OFTEN TIMES -- IF YOU GO AND

02:26:27.011 --> 02:26:28.479
LOOK AND JUST GO WELL MY MY THE

02:26:28.546 --> 02:26:29.213
PEOPLE THAT I'VE SUPPORTED ARE

02:26:29.280 --> 02:26:30.448
SUPPORTING US WITHOUT ACTUALLY

02:26:30.515 --> 02:26:31.916
DIGGING INTO IT.

02:26:31.983 --> 02:26:33.885
NINE I CAN THINK OF A AND A

02:26:33.951 --> 02:26:36.254
STATEWIDE INITIATIVE THAT I WAS --

02:26:36.320 --> 02:26:37.788
AND AUTHOR OF HERE THEY GOT ON

02:26:37.855 --> 02:26:38.789
THE BALLOT IN NAM AND THE

02:26:38.856 --> 02:26:40.224
CALIFORNIA REPUBLICAN PARTY

02:26:40.291 --> 02:26:41.959
OPPOSED IT AND MADE ABSOLUTELY

02:26:42.026 --> 02:26:44.795
ZERO SENSE TO ME -- AND IF.

02:26:44.862 --> 02:26:46.597
IF IF THIS HAD GONE STATEWIDE IT

02:26:46.664 --> 02:26:47.698
WOULD HAVE GONE ON WERE MOST

02:26:47.765 --> 02:26:48.366
REPUBLICANS WOULD HAVE SUPPORTED

02:26:48.432 --> 02:26:50.134
BUT SOME IN THE PARTY DECIDED

02:26:50.201 --> 02:26:52.837
THEY WANTED -- TO TO TO TO GET

02:26:52.904 --> 02:26:54.405
BACK AT ME AND SO THEY SAID NO

02:26:54.472 --> 02:26:54.972
WE'RE GOING TO OPPOSE THIS

02:26:55.039 --> 02:26:56.941
MEASURE WITHOUT THE ELECTORATE

02:26:57.008 --> 02:26:58.242
WITHOUT REPUBLICANS LOOKING AT

02:26:58.309 --> 02:26:59.844
SING YOU KNOW THIS IS IMPORTANT.

02:26:59.911 --> 02:27:02.146
SO I THINK BY LISTING NAMES HERE

02:27:02.213 --> 02:27:04.215
ACTUALLY WILL SKEW -- WHAT THE

02:27:04.282 --> 02:27:06.684

02:28:35.606 --> 02:28:36.907
DANGEROUS.

02:28:36.974 --> 02:28:40.077
