CAMPAIGN- HAS MULTIPLE FACETS-

00:40:23.521 --> 00:40:26.457

ENVIRONMENT THAT IS NOT

00:40:55.286 --> 00:40:58.222
ACCESSIBLE I'M TO CHILDREN. SO

00:40:58.289 --> 00:41:01.225
THE TOBACCO HAS A HUGE ILLEGAL

00:41:01.292 --> 00:41:02.960

PRETTY NEW LEGAL MARKET

00:41:35.626 --> 00:41:36.827
INCLUDING THE REGULATORY

00:41:36.894 --> 00:41:38.362
FRAMEWORK ASSOCIATED WITH THAT

00:41:38.429 --> 00:41:40.164

I CHOICES AS WELL AS CONSUMPTION

00:41:50.841 --> 00:41:52.877
CHOICES. SO WHAT IS THE PART IN

00:41:52.943 --> 00:41:56.080
DOING A TO GO AFTER SHUT DOWN

00:41:56.146 --> 00:41:58.182
ILLEGAL RETAIL STORES. AND THE

00:41:58.249 --> 00:41:59.149
MORE RESOURCES TO SHUT DOWN

00:41:59.216 --> 00:42:05.289
THOSE ILLEGAL RETAILERS. THANK

00:42:05.356 --> 00:42:06.824
YOU FOR THAT QUESTION- AS I

00:42:06.891 --> 00:42:08.959
INDICATED IN MY COMMENTS THE

00:42:09.026 --> 00:42:11.862
DEPARTMENT HAS- TAKEN SOME STEPS

00:42:11.929 --> 00:42:15.466
OVER THE LAST SEVEN MONTHS- TO

00:42:15.532 --> 00:42:17.568
ISSUE WARRANTS OR SUPPORT. OUR

00:42:17.635 --> 00:42:18.969
PARTNERS WHETHER THAT BE ON THE

00:42:19.036 --> 00:42:20.771
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT SIDE STATE

00:42:20.838 --> 00:42:22.473
LINE OR STATE LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:42:22.539 --> 00:42:26.143
SIDE. I RELATED TO ILLICIT OR

00:42:26.210 --> 00:42:27.745
ILLEGAL CANNABIS OPERATIONS

00:42:27.811 --> 00:42:29.680
INCLUDING RETAIL THOSE EFFORTS

00:42:29.747 --> 00:42:31.916
WILL CONTINUE. DOES THAT MAKE

00:42:31.982 --> 00:42:33.717
MORE SENSE TO IDENTIFY THE

00:42:33.784 --> 00:42:35.552
ILLEGAL RETAIL STORES AND SHUT

00:42:35.619 --> 00:42:36.587
HIM DOWN. INTO THE SPENDING SIX

00:42:36.654 --> 00:42:37.554
MILLION DOLLARS TO CONVINCE

00:42:37.621 --> 00:42:40.624
CONSUMERS NOT TO BUY FROM THESE

00:42:40.691 --> 00:42:44.028
ILLEGAL OUTLETS. AS I'VE SAID

00:42:44.094 --> 00:42:45.930
PREVIOUSLY I THINK THAT THIS IS

00:42:45.996 --> 00:42:47.765
A MULTI FACETED EFFORTS THEY ARE

00:42:47.831 --> 00:42:49.400
NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE BOTH ARE

00:42:49.466 --> 00:42:51.402
REQUIRED. BUT I THINK IT IS

00:42:51.468 --> 00:42:53.270
BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT WHEN

00:42:53.337 --> 00:42:54.772
THIS FIRST STARTED OFF A COUPLE

00:42:54.838 --> 00:42:57.207
YEARS AGO- WITH THE WITH THE

00:42:57.274 --> 00:42:59.543
COVETED. WE HAD A LOT OF ILLEGAL

00:42:59.610 --> 00:43:01.078
DEATH WITH VAPING IT WAS

00:43:01.145 --> 00:43:02.813
MARIJUANA VAPING FROM BLACK

00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:05.182
MARKET SO WE HAD AND- AS FAR AS

00:43:05.249 --> 00:43:07.584
I'M TOLD THAT STILL GOING ON.

00:43:07.651 --> 00:43:09.486
JUST LIKE THE ISSUES WITH THE-

00:43:09.553 --> 00:43:11.021
FIT IN ALL ITS JUST COVERT IS

00:43:11.088 --> 00:43:11.989
SUCKED ALL THE AIR OUT OF THE

00:43:12.056 --> 00:43:13.691
SPACE. SO YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT

00:43:13.757 --> 00:43:15.826
THAT MUCH THOSE DEATHS ARE UP-

00:43:15.893 --> 00:43:18.562
UNTIL WE STILL HAVE GUESTS FROM

00:43:18.629 --> 00:43:22.266
THE BLACK MARKET- VAPING. SO BUT

00:43:22.333 --> 00:43:23.500
SIX MORE DOLLARS GO A LOT

00:43:23.567 --> 00:43:25.369
FURTHER AND BECAUSE YOU HAVE A

00:43:25.436 --> 00:43:26.904
LOT OF ALICE OUT THERE SELLING

00:43:26.971 --> 00:43:29.139
RIGHT NOW. IN SHOWING THOSE

00:43:29.206 --> 00:43:33.377
OUTLETS DOWN. I THINK WE REQUIRE

00:43:33.444 --> 00:43:34.912
BOTH OF THOSE EFFORTS ASSEMBLY

00:43:34.979 --> 00:43:37.748
MEMBER- WITH A VALLEY THERE.

00:43:37.815 --> 00:43:39.016
WERE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER F

00:43:39.083 --> 00:43:40.517
THOSE PRODUCTS THAT WERE

00:43:40.584 --> 00:43:41.285
PURCHASED OFF OF THE ILLEGAL

00:43:41.352 --> 00:43:43.487
MARKET HOWEVER WE DID SEAT

00:43:43.554 --> 00:43:45.889
CONSUMER PATTERNS CHANGE- DURING

00:43:45.956 --> 00:43:48.459
A VALLEY BECAUSE IT WAS SUCH A

00:43:48.525 --> 00:43:50.394
PUBLIC- RIGHTS CAMPAIGN QUITE

00:43:50.461 --> 00:43:52.229
FRANKLY I RELATED TO THE HARM

00:43:52.296 --> 00:43:53.897
THAT THOSE PRODUCTS WERE CAUSING

00:43:53.964 --> 00:43:55.966
FOR CONSUMERS. SO ENSURING THAT

00:43:56.033 --> 00:43:57.801
THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT PRODUCTS

00:43:57.868 --> 00:44:00.170
ARE LEGAL IS IMPORTANT SO THAT

00:44:00.237 --> 00:44:02.373
THEIR PURCHASING THOSE PRODUCTS-

00:44:02.439 --> 00:44:04.308
LEGALLY AND CONSUMING PRODUCTS

00:44:04.375 --> 00:44:06.276
THAT HAVE BEEN TESTED WHILE ALSO

00:44:06.343 --> 00:44:08.645
CAN CURRENTLY GOING ON- AND

00:44:08.712 --> 00:44:09.680
ENFORCING AGAINST THE RETAIL

00:44:09.747 --> 00:44:11.281
OPERATIONS IN THE MANUFACTURING

00:44:11.348 --> 00:44:13.017
OPERATIONS THAT ARE PRODUCING.

00:44:13.083 --> 00:44:14.485
THERE'S A LEGAL PRODUCTS

00:44:14.551 --> 00:44:17.254
INCLUDING BIG CARTRIDGES THAT

00:44:17.321 --> 00:44:18.389
ARE HARMFUL TO CONSUMERS. WILL

00:44:18.455 --> 00:44:20.557
THAT 506030% A MARIJUANA GROWING

00:44:20.624 --> 00:44:22.559
CALIFORNIA'S GONNA LEAVE ILLEGAL

00:44:22.626 --> 00:44:24.595
MARKET AS FAR AS RETAIL WHAT DO

00:44:24.661 --> 00:44:28.265
YOU NUMBERS. ON ILLEGAL RETAIL

00:44:28.332 --> 00:44:33.203
SHOPS WHAT PERCENTAGE. IT IS A

00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:34.772
GOOD QUESTION ASSEMBLY MEMBER

00:44:34.838 --> 00:44:36.073
AND I DON'T KNOW THE EXACT

00:44:36.140 --> 00:44:37.574
NUMBER OF THE LEGAL RETAIL

00:44:37.641 --> 00:44:38.909
LOCATIONS BUT I CAN TELL YOU

00:44:38.976 --> 00:44:40.344
THAT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF

00:44:40.411 --> 00:44:42.546
THE STATE DOES NOT HAVE ACCESS

00:44:42.613 --> 00:44:43.380
TO LEGAL RETAIL BECAUSE THE

00:44:43.447 --> 00:44:45.015
JURISDICTIONS HAVE. PROVIDE ARE

00:44:45.082 --> 00:44:46.984
PROHIBITED OP PATHWAYS TO

REGULATED RETAIL FOR BUSINESSES

00:44:48.852 --> 00:44:50.254
IN THEIR JURISDICTIONS SO THAT

00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:51.822
IS SOMETHING WE ARE ALSO WORKING

00:44:51.889 --> 00:44:53.791

GOVERNMENTS. I AM CREATING

00:44:55.526 --> 00:44:56.927
PATHWAYS FOR LEGITIMATE

00:44:56.994 --> 00:44:58.495
BUSINESSES TO PROVIDE LEGAL

00:44:58.562 --> 00:45:00.097
PRODUCTS TO CONSUMERS WITHOUT

00:45:00.164 --> 00:45:02.132
PART OF PROP SIXTY FOUR NICHOLS

LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WHATEVER SAY

00:45:03.233 --> 00:45:04.935
SO. WHEN THEY HAD CANNABIS IN

00:45:05.002 --> 00:45:06.870
THEIR JURISDICTIONS ARE NOT. SO

00:45:06.937 --> 00:45:08.205
IT IS STILL GOES BACK YOU CAN

00:45:08.272 --> 00:45:12.176
SPEND MONEY ON A PROBLEM. AND

00:45:12.242 --> 00:45:13.310
YET YOU DON'T KNOW THE SCOPE OF

00:45:13.377 --> 00:45:14.044
THE PROBLEM. SO YOU CAN'T TELL

RESTORE RETAIL STORES ARE ARE SO

00:45:21.852 --> 00:45:24.221
FOR ME THAT IS DOESN'T JIVE. YOU

00:45:24.288 --> 00:45:25.322
GOT TO HAVE SOME IDEA WHAT

00:45:25.389 --> 00:45:28.058

00:45:29.493 --> 00:45:30.994
STATEMENT I THINK AS IT RELATES

00:45:31.061 --> 00:45:33.063
TO SPECIFIC JURISDICTIONS. I WE

00:45:33.130 --> 00:45:34.098
DO HAVE A SENSE OF WHAT WE'RE

00:45:34.164 --> 00:45:35.866

THAT'S A LIVING SORT OF-

00:45:41.872 --> 00:45:43.740
ENVIRONMENTS WHERE THOSE POP UP

00:45:43.807 --> 00:45:46.009

00:45:47.845 --> 00:45:50.380
CONTINUE TO BE PART OF OUR

00:45:50.447 --> 00:45:51.081
ENFORCEMENT STRATEGY- BUT

00:45:51.148 --> 00:45:53.083
CONCURRENT TO THAT WE ALSO THINK

00:45:53.150 --> 00:45:54.618
IT'S- JUST EQUALLY AS IMPORTANT

00:45:54.685 --> 00:45:56.053
TO ENSURE CONSUMERS KNOW WHAT IS

00:45:56.120 --> 00:45:57.654
THE EAGLE AND WHAT IT'S NOT. BUT

WHATSOEVER. SO HOW ARE YOU IT

00:46:15.772 --> 00:46:16.974

PROBLEM THEIR POP UPS. YOU CAN'T

00:48:23.867 --> 00:48:25.702
PIN THAT DOWN. AND THERE SHOULD

00:48:25.769 --> 00:48:27.571
BE SOME WAY THROUGH SEARCH

00:48:27.638 --> 00:48:29.539
WARRANTS THROUGH INVESTIGATIONS.

00:48:29.606 --> 00:48:30.941
AND MOST AS INVESTIGATIONS ARE

00:48:31.008 --> 00:48:32.309
NOT DONE BY THE BUREAU OF

00:48:32.376 --> 00:48:34.077

GOT A PROBLEM WE'LL HAVE BIGGER

00:48:50.927 --> 00:48:53.130
PROBLEM IS. IT I DON'T. ACCEPT

00:48:53.196 --> 00:48:54.698

WE HAVE ISSUED OR SUPPORTED

00:49:12.115 --> 00:49:13.650
EIGHTY FOUR SEARCH WARRANTS

00:49:13.717 --> 00:49:14.818
TWENTY FOUR OF THOSE HAVE BEEN

00:49:14.885 --> 00:49:17.521
ON RETAIL SINCE. THIS INST

00:49:17.587 --> 00:49:19.456
ESTABLISHMENT OF A LEGAL

00:49:19.523 --> 00:49:21.491
COMMERCIAL MARKET AND THERE HAS

00:49:21.558 --> 00:49:23.093
BEEN A HUNDRED AND FORTY NINE

00:49:27.331 --> 00:49:28.265
THAT'S BEAUTIFUL BECAUSE YOU CAN

00:49:28.332 --> 00:49:29.733
GET A LOCAL JURISDICTION EVEN

00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:32.602
HERE SACRAMENTO WHERE IS THE IS

00:49:32.669 --> 00:49:34.905
THE FIFTH LARGEST COUNTY AND

00:49:34.971 --> 00:49:36.173
THEY DO THAT RESEARCH ONCE IN

00:49:36.239 --> 00:49:37.874
ONE COUNTY SO IF THAT'S THE MOST

00:49:37.941 --> 00:49:41.111
NOT YOU'VE DONE STATEWIDE. THAT

00:49:41.178 --> 00:49:42.579
IS ABYSMAL. EMPIRE THE PROBLEM

00:49:42.646 --> 00:49:43.380
IS THERE IS NO ENFORCEMENT FOR

00:49:43.447 --> 00:49:44.715

00:49:44.781 --> 00:49:46.750
WHATSOEVER. THERE IS ZERO FOR

00:49:46.817 --> 00:49:48.318

00:49:48.385 --> 00:49:49.653
GETTING LICENSES AND GETTING

KNOW THE BLACK MARKET IS A BIG

00:49:52.589 --> 00:49:54.991
PROBLEM IS NEVER BEEN TACKLED SO

00:49:55.058 --> 00:49:56.226
FOR THOSE NUMBER OF WARRANTS

00:49:56.293 --> 00:49:57.694
YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT. THOSE ARE

00:49:57.761 --> 00:50:01.031
MINUSCULE THAT IS ABYSMAL TO DO

00:50:01.098 --> 00:50:02.699
THAT SO I'M NOT GONNA BELIEVE

00:50:02.766 --> 00:50:04.835
THE POINT BUT I'M DONE BUT- YOU

00:50:04.901 --> 00:50:06.803
GUYS HAVE TO HAVE BETTER NUMBERS

00:50:06.870 --> 00:50:07.804

00:50:25.188 --> 00:50:26.890
ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOWEVER WE THINK

00:50:26.957 --> 00:50:27.924
IT'S IMPORTANT TO DO A

00:50:27.991 --> 00:50:29.860
CONCURRENT WITH THAT FOCUS.

00:50:29.926 --> 00:50:30.827
ADDITIONAL THINGS LIKE

COUNTIES THAT IS ONE PERSON FOR

00:50:47.444 --> 00:50:49.980
COUNTY SO THE MAJORITY THIS WORK

00:50:50.046 --> 00:50:51.948
IS BEING DONE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL

00:50:52.015 --> 00:50:53.984
THE NOT THE STATE LEVEL AND

00:50:54.050 --> 00:50:55.051
THAT'S WHERE THE MAJORITY ARE

00:50:55.118 --> 00:50:58.021
EXPERTISE LIES WITH THOSE LOCAL

00:50:58.088 --> 00:50:58.989
INVESTIGATORS NOT AT THE STATE

00:50:59.055 --> 00:51:00.924
LEVEL. AND I THINK WE CAN CARE

00:51:00.991 --> 00:51:02.058
WITH YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHICH

00:51:02.125 --> 00:51:03.493
IS WHY THE MAJORITY OF OUR

WARRANTS ARE H. OURS ARE DONE IN

00:51:05.796 --> 00:51:15.705

00:51:25.115 --> 00:51:26.783
FROM THE FRONT- THE WAS X. AND

00:51:26.850 --> 00:51:28.752
THE LACK OF APPETITE ON THE

00:51:28.819 --> 00:51:30.754
ENFORCEMENT SIDE- CERTAINLY

00:51:30.821 --> 00:51:34.424
THERE. WE TRULY KNOW THAT THE

00:51:34.491 --> 00:51:36.359
ILLICIT MARKET THERE'S CLEARLY

00:51:36.426 --> 00:51:38.295
OVERPOWERING THE LEGITIMATE

00:51:38.361 --> 00:51:40.230
MARKET AND I SEE THAT THERE ARE

00:51:40.297 --> 00:51:41.965
SOME EFFORTS HERE TO TRY TO.

00:51:42.032 --> 00:51:44.034
CORRECT THAT TO SOME DEGREE BUT-

00:51:44.100 --> 00:51:45.702
THAT THE ENFORCEMENT ASPECT

00:51:45.769 --> 00:51:47.637
ESPECIALLY IN THE DISTRICT I

00:51:47.704 --> 00:51:51.541
LOVE. NOT SO MUCH IN THE RETAIL

00:51:51.608 --> 00:51:54.044
SPACE BUT AND THE- THE GROW. THE

00:51:54.110 --> 00:51:56.580
ACT ILICIC GROWS THAT WE HAVE

00:51:56.646 --> 00:51:59.216
OUT IN THE DESERT ARE ALARMING.

00:51:59.282 --> 00:52:01.418
AND- WAY OVERPOWERING. AND IT

00:52:01.485 --> 00:52:03.019
DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THERE'S MUCH

00:52:03.086 --> 00:52:04.521
OF AN APPETITE TO REALLY ADDRESS

00:52:04.588 --> 00:52:07.557
THAT PROBLEM. AND I THINK THAT-

00:52:07.624 --> 00:52:09.493
THAT'S A VERY CRITICAL ASPECT.

00:52:09.559 --> 00:52:11.294
AND I WOULD HOPE THAT- YOUR

00:52:11.361 --> 00:52:12.295
DEPARTMENT WOULD HAVE INTEREST

00:52:12.362 --> 00:52:14.965
IN TRYING TO PARTNER WITH WITH

00:52:15.031 --> 00:52:17.033
THE EFFORTS TO TRY TO CURB. AND

00:52:17.100 --> 00:52:19.569
TO ELIMINATE THAT PARTICULAR

00:52:19.636 --> 00:52:21.538
ASPECT OF THE CANNABIS MARKET IT

00:52:21.605 --> 00:52:24.241
TRULY IS A HEARTBREAK TO KNOW

00:52:24.307 --> 00:52:26.276
THAT- THERE ARE PLENTY WHO ARE

00:52:26.343 --> 00:52:28.745
TRYING TO FOLLOW BY THE RULES

00:52:28.812 --> 00:52:30.046
AND PLAY BY THE RULES AND THEY-

00:52:30.113 --> 00:52:32.115
THEY EXPEND A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT

00:52:32.182 --> 00:52:34.484
OF MONEY TO TRY TO BE IN

00:52:34.551 --> 00:52:36.219
COMPLIANCE AND- THE DISTINCTION

00:52:36.286 --> 00:52:38.154
EVEN AT THE RETAIL LEVEL AS

00:52:38.221 --> 00:52:40.857
BROUGHT UP BY MY COLLEAGUE. IS

00:52:40.924 --> 00:52:43.693
ALSO VERY- DISARMING. AND I

00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:45.595
THINK YOU BRING UP A GOOD POINT

00:52:45.662 --> 00:52:47.664
THOUGH THAT THE CONSUMER OFTEN.

00:52:47.731 --> 00:52:49.799
HAS A HARD TIME DISCRIMINATING.

00:52:49.866 --> 00:52:53.003
UPSIDE A PRICE- BECAUSE THE

00:52:53.069 --> 00:52:54.671
PRICE ADVANTAGE IN THE ILLICIT

00:52:54.738 --> 00:52:56.907
MARKET AS YOU KNOW. AS ARE NOT

00:52:56.973 --> 00:52:59.776
CLOSE TO COMPETING AT HAS AN

00:52:59.843 --> 00:53:01.311
EXTREME AND MANAGE AND THAT'S

00:53:01.378 --> 00:53:04.314
WHY IT'S DOING SO WELL. SO

00:53:04.381 --> 00:53:05.315
ANYWAYS I THINK THE LACK OF

00:53:05.382 --> 00:53:07.651
APPETITE FOR FORSMAN IS

00:53:07.717 --> 00:53:08.218
DISCOURAGING BUT- I'M HOPING

00:53:08.285 --> 00:53:11.288
THAT- WE CAN WORK ON THAT

00:53:11.354 --> 00:53:15.258
TOGETHER. THANK YOU FOR THOSE

00:53:15.325 --> 00:53:16.526

QUARTERS AS YOU CAN SEE HAS BEEN

00:57:02.018 --> 00:57:04.320
MUCH SLOWER. NEXT WE WILL COVER

00:57:04.387 --> 00:57:06.623
SOME OF THE BASIC FEATURES OF

STATE AND LOCAL CANNABIS TAXES

00:57:08.391 --> 00:57:11.194
AND CALIFORNIA. PROPOSITION

00:57:11.261 --> 00:57:11.728
SIXTY FOUR SET THE STATE'S

00:57:11.795 --> 00:57:15.165
EXCISE TAX RATE AT 15% OF THE

00:57:15.231 --> 00:57:18.334
RETAIL PRICE. SB NINETY FOUR

00:57:18.401 --> 00:57:19.335
MOVED THE REMITTANCE

00:57:19.402 --> 00:57:22.705
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS TAX FROM

00:57:22.772 --> 00:57:25.074
RETAILERS TO DISTRIBUTORS. BUT

00:57:25.141 --> 00:57:26.643
WHEN RETAILERS BUY CANNABIS

00:57:26.709 --> 00:57:28.077
PRODUCTS FROM DISTRIBUTORS

00:57:28.144 --> 00:57:29.546
NOBODY KNOWS FOR SURE WHAT THE

00:57:29.612 --> 00:57:32.448
ULTIMATE RETAIL PRICE WILL BE SO

00:57:32.515 --> 00:57:34.050
TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR

00:57:34.117 --> 00:57:36.953
DISTRIBUTORS TO REMIT THE TAX SB

00:57:37.020 --> 00:57:38.254
NINETY FOUR EFFECTIVELY TURNS

THEIR SO CALLED RETAIL TAX INTO

00:57:41.224 --> 00:57:43.993
A WHOLE SALES TAX. THE STATUTE

00:57:44.060 --> 00:57:45.228
DIRECTS THE DEPARTMEN OF TAX

00:57:45.295 --> 00:57:46.796
AND FEE ADMINISTRATION TO

00:57:46.863 --> 00:57:48.832
ESTIMATE THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE

00:57:48.898 --> 00:57:51.234
RETAIL MARKET. AND THEY USE THAT

00:57:51.301 --> 00:57:53.603
NUMBER TO ESTIMATE THE WHOLESALE

00:57:53.670 --> 00:57:56.272
TAX RATE IT'S EQUIVALENT ON

00:57:56.339 --> 00:58:00.376
AVERAGE TO A 15% RETAIL TAX

00:58:00.443 --> 00:58:05.348

00:58:05.415 --> 00:58:06.416
OF THE WHOLESALE PRICE. THE

OTHER STATEWIDE CANNABIS TAXES

00:58:08.151 --> 00:58:10.820
THE CULTIVATION TAX THIS TAX IS

00:58:10.887 --> 00:58:12.755
A FIXED DOLLAR AMOUNT PER IN

00:58:12.822 --> 00:58:14.557
HOUSE WITH DIFFERENT RATES FOR

00:58:14.624 --> 00:58:16.092
THREE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES OF

00:58:16.159 --> 00:58:18.494
HARVESTED CANNABIS. PROP SIXTY

00:58:18.561 --> 00:58:19.629

00:58:19.696 --> 00:58:21.264
INFLATION ADJUSTMENTS FOR THESE

00:58:21.331 --> 00:58:23.333
TAX RATES AND THAT KEEPS THE

00:58:23.399 --> 00:58:25.301
REAL TAX RATE CONSTANT OVER THE

00:58:25.368 --> 00:58:28.504
LONG TERM. SB NINETY FOUR MADE

00:58:28.571 --> 00:58:29.873
DISTRIBUTORS RESPONSIBLE FOR

00:58:29.939 --> 00:58:31.541
REMITTING THIS TAX TO THE STATE

00:58:31.608 --> 00:58:33.910
JUST AS IT DID FOR THE RETAIL

00:58:33.977 --> 00:58:35.545
EXCISE TAX. THE THIRD MAJOR

00:58:35.612 --> 00:58:36.980
PIECE OF THE PUZZLE IS THE

00:58:37.046 --> 00:58:38.448
CANNABIS TAXES THAT LOCAL

00:58:38.514 --> 00:58:40.149
GOVERNMENTS IMPOSE ON BUSINESSES

00:58:40.216 --> 00:58:41.818
ALL UP AND DOWN THE CANNABIS

00:58:41.885 --> 00:58:44.520
SUPPLY CHAIN. IN TWENTY NINETEEN

00:58:44.587 --> 00:58:45.755
WE ESTIMATED THAT THE TOTAL

00:58:45.822 --> 00:58:48.224
STATEWIDE AVERAGE LOCAL CANNABIS

00:58:48.291 --> 00:58:49.993
TAX WAIT RATE WAS ROUGHLY

00:58:50.059 --> 00:58:55.431
EQUIVALENT. TO A 14% TAX ON

00:58:55.498 --> 00:58:58.268
RETAIL SALES. NOW I'LL SHOW YOU

00:58:58.334 --> 00:59:00.970
A FIGURE HERE. THE ILLUSTRATES

00:59:01.037 --> 00:59:03.907
THE FLOW AND TAX PAYMENTS FOR

00:59:03.973 --> 00:59:06.876
THE TWO STATEWIDE CANNABIS TAXES

00:59:06.943 --> 00:59:08.845
. UNDER CURRENT LAW BEFORE

00:59:08.912 --> 00:59:10.580
BUSINESSES MAKE TAX PAYMENTS TO

00:59:10.647 --> 00:59:13.116
THE STATE AS YOU CAN SEE THE

00:59:13.182 --> 00:59:15.184
FIGURE WE HAVE TAX PAYMENTS FROM

00:59:15.251 --> 00:59:17.053
BUSINESSES TO OTHER BUSINESSES

00:59:17.120 --> 00:59:18.454
AND THEN IN THAT CASE THE

00:59:18.521 --> 00:59:20.723
CULTIVATION TAX SOMETIMES ONCE

00:59:20.790 --> 00:59:22.025
OR TWICE MORE TO OTHER

00:59:22.091 --> 00:59:23.426
BUSINESSES AND OTHER BUSINESSES

00:59:23.493 --> 00:59:24.694
BEFORE THEY EVENTUALLY MAKE

00:59:24.761 --> 00:59:28.731
THEIR WAY TO. THE STATE. AND

00:59:28.798 --> 00:59:29.933
I'LL WRAP UP MY REMARKS BY

00:59:29.999 --> 00:59:31.067
HIGHLIGHTING A FEW

00:59:31.134 --> 00:59:32.769
RECOMMENDATIONS FROM A

00:59:32.835 --> 00:59:35.772
STATUTORILY REQUIRED REPORT OUR

00:59:35.838 --> 00:59:36.906
OFFICE PUBLISHED IN TWENTY

00:59:36.973 --> 00:59:39.242
NINETEEN. THESE RECOMMENDATIONS

00:59:39.309 --> 00:59:40.576
REFLECT A SEQUENCE OF THREE

00:59:40.643 --> 00:59:43.880
MAJOR POLICY CHOICES FIRST

00:59:43.947 --> 00:59:45.214
THERE'S THE CHOICE OF WHAT TYPE

00:59:45.281 --> 00:59:47.450
OF TAX TO LEVY. OUR PRIMARY

00:59:47.517 --> 00:59:49.319
RECOMMENDATION WAS TO REPLACE

00:59:49.385 --> 00:59:51.054
THE STATE'S CANNABIS TAXES WITH

00:59:51.120 --> 00:59:53.456
A POTENCY BASED OR CHEERED AT

00:59:53.523 --> 00:59:56.626
VALOREM TAX ALTERNATIVELY IF

00:59:56.693 --> 00:59:58.261
EASE OF ADMINISTRATION AND

00:59:58.328 --> 01:00:00.196
COMPLIANCE IS THE TOP PRIORITY

01:00:00.263 --> 01:00:02.565
THE LEGISLATURE COULD. STICK

01:00:02.632 --> 01:00:05.201
WITH THE RETAIL EXCISE TAX

01:00:05.268 --> 01:00:07.003
EITHER WAY WE RECOMMENDED

01:00:07.070 --> 01:00:09.839
ELIMINATING THE CULTIVATION TAX.

01:00:09.906 --> 01:00:12.175
SECOND WE RECOMMENDED COLLECTING

01:00:12.241 --> 01:00:14.010
TAXES FROM BUSINESSES THAT

01:00:14.077 --> 01:00:16.813
PARTICIPATE DIRECTLY IN WHATEVER

01:00:16.879 --> 01:00:18.648
ACTIVITY IS BEING TAXED. THAT

01:00:18.715 --> 01:00:20.016
WOULD MEAN FOR EXAMPLE

01:00:20.083 --> 01:00:21.918
COLLECTING THE RETAIL EXCISE TAX

01:00:21.985 --> 01:00:24.821
FOR RETAILERS RATHER THAN

01:00:24.887 --> 01:00:26.356
DISTRIBUTORS. AND THIRD WE NOTED

01:00:26.422 --> 01:00:28.057
THAT THE LEGISLATURE REASONABLY

01:00:28.124 --> 01:00:29.926
COULD CONSIDER A WIDE RANGE OF

01:00:29.993 --> 01:00:32.095
TAX RATE. I CONCLUDES MY

01:00:32.161 --> 01:00:33.696
PREPARED REMARKS AND I'D BE

01:00:33.763 --> 01:00:35.898

IN REVENUE. AND THAT FIGURE

01:01:21.444 --> 01:01:23.946

SALES AND USE TAX ACTUALLY GOES

01:01:25.681 --> 01:01:29.585
BACK- TO MUNICIPALITIES AROUND

THOSE FIGURES THAT'S NOT ALL

01:01:33.890 --> 01:01:36.492
STATE REVENUE- I KNOW THERE'S

01:01:36.559 --> 01:01:38.094

CANNABIS BEING TOO HIGH AND CD

01:01:41.197 --> 01:01:44.534
TFA. IS THAT GNOSTIC ON THAT

01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:47.804
QUESTION- WE WILL ADMINISTER THE

01:01:47.870 --> 01:01:50.573

THE RATES HOW. I DO THINK THAT

01:01:57.980 --> 01:01:59.348
THERE ARE- ARE TWO IMPORTANT

01:01:59.415 --> 01:02:01.984
GENERAL TAX PRINCIPLES- THAT I

01:02:02.051 --> 01:02:03.019
WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO KEEP IN

01:02:03.086 --> 01:02:04.320
MIND AS YOU CONSIDER ANY

01:02:04.387 --> 01:02:06.489
POSSIBLE MODIFICATIONS- TO THE

01:02:06.556 --> 01:02:10.660
STATE'S CANNABIS TAXES. FIRST

01:02:10.726 --> 01:02:12.562
TAXES SHOULD BE AS SIMPLE AS

01:02:12.628 --> 01:02:15.131
POSSIBLE AT C. D. T. F. A. WE

01:02:15.198 --> 01:02:15.631
ADMINISTER THIRTY EIGHT

01:02:15.698 --> 01:02:17.033
DIFFERENT TAX AND FEE PROGRAMS.

01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:18.067
ON BEHALF OF THE STATE OF

01:02:18.134 --> 01:02:19.502
CALIFORNIA AND I CAN CONFIRM

01:02:19.569 --> 01:02:21.204
WHAT MANY IF YOU ALREADY

01:02:21.270 --> 01:02:24.907
SUSPECT. TAXES ARE COMPLICATED.

01:02:24.974 --> 01:02:29.078
BUT EVEN IN- THAT WORLD

01:02:29.145 --> 01:02:30.780
COMPLICATED TAXES CALIFORNIA'S

01:02:30.847 --> 01:02:33.749
CAMPUS TAXES ARE PARTICULARLY

01:02:33.816 --> 01:02:35.718
COMPLEX AND THAT COMPLEXITY.

01:02:35.785 --> 01:02:37.120
NEGATIVELY IMPACTS OUR

01:02:37.186 --> 01:02:39.922
ADMINISTRATION OF THE TAXES AND

01:02:39.989 --> 01:02:41.824
IT ADDS A BURDEN FOR BUSINESSES

01:02:41.891 --> 01:02:43.326
THAT ARE BEING RESPONSIBLE AND

01:02:43.392 --> 01:02:45.394
IF YOU'RE INTO THE POOLS. MIGHT

01:02:45.461 --> 01:02:46.329
BE HAPPY TO DISCUSS THOSE

01:02:46.395 --> 01:02:47.964
COMPLEXITIES I'M IN MORE DETAIL

01:02:48.030 --> 01:02:50.032
IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS. THE

01:02:50.099 --> 01:02:51.901
SECOND PORTENT POINT I THAT I

01:02:51.968 --> 01:02:55.471
THINK- I ENCOURAGE YOU TO KEEP

01:02:55.538 --> 01:02:57.006
IN MIND. IS THAT THE TAX

01:02:57.073 --> 01:02:58.975
STRUCTURE SHOULD BE FAIR TO

01:02:59.041 --> 01:03:00.009
THOSE BUSINESSES THAT ARE

01:03:00.076 --> 01:03:04.280
COMPLYING AS YOU HAVE ALREADY-

01:03:04.347 --> 01:03:06.516
BIRD TODAY. CALIFORNIA FACES

01:03:06.582 --> 01:03:08.551
THIS- A PROBLEM OF NON

01:03:08.618 --> 01:03:10.520
COMPLIANCE I IN THE CANNABIS

01:03:10.586 --> 01:03:14.257
SPACED. AND WE AT CD TFA

01:03:14.323 --> 01:03:15.424
FREQUENTLY HEAR FROM LEGAL

01:03:15.491 --> 01:03:17.026
CANNABIS BUSINESSES THAT THEY

01:03:17.093 --> 01:03:18.060
ARE BEING UNDERCUT BY THOSE

01:03:18.127 --> 01:03:20.530
BUSINESSES OPERATING OFTEN

01:03:20.596 --> 01:03:22.231
OPERATING TOTALLY OUT IN THE

01:03:22.298 --> 01:03:24.834
OPEN- OUTSIDE OF THE LEGAL

01:03:24.901 --> 01:03:27.036
MARKET. AND TO ADDRESS THIS

01:03:27.103 --> 01:03:27.904
PROBLEM AND TO BRING FAIRNESS TO

01:03:27.970 --> 01:03:30.039
THE MARKET I IT'S IMPORTANT THAT

01:03:30.106 --> 01:03:32.008
CONSIDERATIONS OF TAX CHANGES

EXPLOITING ANY UNFAIR TAX

01:03:39.916 --> 01:03:44.187
ADVANTAGE- I THERE ARE MANY

01:03:44.253 --> 01:03:46.122
POSSIBLE WAYS TO DO THIS EVEN

01:03:46.189 --> 01:03:48.858
JUST EXPECT EXTENDING MANY OF

01:03:48.925 --> 01:03:50.159
THE ENFORCEMENT MEASURES THAT WE

01:03:50.226 --> 01:03:51.894

INSTANCE. TO THE CANNABIS TAXES

01:03:55.031 --> 01:03:58.935
WOULD HELP GREATLY- AS WE TRY TO

01:03:59.001 --> 01:04:01.037
LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD AND

01:04:01.103 --> 01:04:03.973
CLOSE DOWN ILLEGAL OPERATORS

01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:06.676

LEGAL MARKET VERSUS THE ILLEGAL

01:10:33.162 --> 01:10:34.997

01:16:42.464 --> 01:16:45.133
IS- POTENCY BASED SORT OF LIKE

01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:46.301
THE ONE WE DISCUSSED IN OUR

01:16:46.368 --> 01:16:47.703
REPORT THAT'S ANOTHER TYPE IT'S

01:16:47.769 --> 01:16:50.539
OUT THERE- SO THAT'S IT WITH

01:16:50.605 --> 01:16:52.607
REGARD TO SIR STATE LEVEL TAXES

01:16:52.674 --> 01:16:54.977
THAT'S SORT OF AN OVERVIEW. ONE

01:16:55.043 --> 01:16:56.378
STRIKING DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

01:16:56.445 --> 01:16:59.648
CALIFORNIA AND OTHER STATES WITH

01:16:59.715 --> 01:17:01.750
LEGAL CANNABIS IS HOW WE

01:17:01.817 --> 01:17:05.153
APPROACH LOCAL TAXATION SO MOST

01:17:05.220 --> 01:17:09.524
OTHER STATES. ARE PLACED AT A

01:17:09.591 --> 01:17:10.559
FAIR BIT OF- LIMITS OR

01:17:10.625 --> 01:17:12.294
RESTRICTIONS ON HOW THEIR LOCAL

01:17:12.361 --> 01:17:14.162
GOVERNMENTS CAN TAX CANNABIS AND

01:17:14.229 --> 01:17:16.365
HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE DON'T DO

01:17:16.431 --> 01:17:18.367
THAT PRETTY MUCH THE LOCALS ARE.

01:17:18.433 --> 01:17:21.136
ARE PERMITTED TO TAX AS THEY

01:17:21.203 --> 01:17:23.705
WISH- AND SO ARE THE SPECIFIC

01:17:23.772 --> 01:17:25.040
TYPES OF RESTRICTIONS THAT YOU

01:17:25.107 --> 01:17:26.908
TEND TO SEE IN OTHER STATES IS

01:17:26.975 --> 01:17:28.210
TYPICALLY LIMITING LOCAL

01:17:28.276 --> 01:17:30.412
TAXATION OF CANNABIS TO THE

01:17:30.479 --> 01:17:32.948
RETAIL LEVEL ON- THE ONLY OTHER

01:17:33.015 --> 01:17:34.282
STATE THAT WE'RE AWARE OF THAT

01:17:34.349 --> 01:17:36.351
ALLOWS TAXES ON OTHER TYPES OF

01:17:36.418 --> 01:17:38.387
NON RETAIL CANNABIS BUSINESSES

01:17:38.453 --> 01:17:41.323
IS. ILLINOIS AND EVEN THEN THEY

01:17:41.390 --> 01:17:43.725
DO CAP RATES THAT LOCAL

01:17:43.792 --> 01:17:45.127
GOVERNMENTS CAN LET THE STAFF

01:17:45.193 --> 01:17:47.229
JUST A QUICK OVERVIEW AS FAR AS

01:17:47.295 --> 01:17:51.099
LESSONS LEARNED- THE ONE MAJOR

01:17:51.166 --> 01:17:52.868
CANNABIS TAX REFORM IN OTHER

01:17:52.934 --> 01:17:54.936
STATES THAT WE'RE AWARE OF IT IS

01:17:55.003 --> 01:17:56.838
A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO AND

01:17:56.905 --> 01:17:59.107
WASHINGTON. WHAT THEY USED TO

01:17:59.174 --> 01:18:02.911
HAVE WAS THEY HAD- TAXES THAT

01:18:02.978 --> 01:18:04.913
WORK PERCENTAGE OF THE PRICE AT

01:18:04.980 --> 01:18:07.449
A VARIETY OF OUR- DIFFERENT

01:18:07.516 --> 01:18:09.451
LEVELS STAGES OF PRODUCTION

01:18:09.518 --> 01:18:10.285
DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE SUPPLY

01:18:10.352 --> 01:18:11.753
CHAIN. AND WHAT THEY DID WAS

01:18:11.820 --> 01:18:14.089
THEY DID NOT SIMPLIFY THEIR

01:18:14.156 --> 01:18:16.358
SYSTEM TO ARE THEY ESSENTIALLY

01:18:16.425 --> 01:18:17.893
ELIMINATED THE TAXES OF THE

01:18:17.959 --> 01:18:19.294
OTHER PARTS OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN

01:18:19.361 --> 01:18:22.197
AND INCREASES THE RATE AT THE-

01:18:22.264 --> 01:18:24.232
RETAIL LEVEL SO THAT SORT OF DAY

01:18:24.299 --> 01:18:26.134
I THINK THEY DID FIND THAT.

01:18:26.201 --> 01:18:29.538
PRIOR SYSTEM TO BE- UNDESIRABLE

01:18:29.604 --> 01:18:30.639
FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS

01:18:30.705 --> 01:18:32.240
CERTAINLY THERE'S THE COMPLEXITY

01:18:32.307 --> 01:18:38.013
ASPECT BUT. ALSO- I THINK THAT

01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:41.183
THE I THAT IT I. CREATE A- I. AN

01:18:41.249 --> 01:18:42.818
ADVANTAGE FOR VERTICALLY

01:18:42.884 --> 01:18:44.519
INTEGRATED BUSINESSES THAT

01:18:44.586 --> 01:18:51.393
POSSIBLY DUE TO TAX STRUCTURE.

01:18:51.460 --> 01:18:52.494
THANK YOU THERE ARE NO

01:18:52.561 --> 01:18:53.862
ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS- MISTER

01:18:53.929 --> 01:18:56.698
LUCKY. IT'S JUST A KIND OF A

01:18:56.765 --> 01:18:58.500
COMMENT AND THEN A- A QUESTION

01:18:58.567 --> 01:19:00.969
REAL QUICKLY. MY BELIEVE THAT

01:19:01.036 --> 01:19:03.538
IS. THAT THE GOAL OF PROP SIXTY

01:19:03.605 --> 01:19:04.473
FOUR WAS TO TAKE CANNABIS

01:19:04.539 --> 01:19:05.607
PRODUCTION OF CELLS OUT OF THE

01:19:05.674 --> 01:19:07.542
HANDS THE ONLY. THE ILLEGAL

01:19:07.609 --> 01:19:10.212
MARKET THAT IS NECESSARY AND WE

01:19:10.278 --> 01:19:12.280
HEARD THIS EXPRESSED EARLIER.

01:19:12.347 --> 01:19:13.281
FOR THE LEGAL MARKET TO BE

01:19:13.348 --> 01:19:14.950
FAIRLY TAXED AND OPERATE IN A

01:19:15.016 --> 01:19:17.119
SIMPLIFIED COMPLIANCE AND

01:19:17.185 --> 01:19:20.722
REPORTING SYSTEM- AND IT ALSO

01:19:20.789 --> 01:19:22.624
HAS TO BE SUBJECT TO INSPECTION

01:19:22.691 --> 01:19:24.292
AND ENFORCEMENT. THAT COULD BE

01:19:24.359 --> 01:19:27.028
CARRIED OUT RELATIVELY SIMPLE

01:19:27.095 --> 01:19:29.931
THESE ACTIONS CANNOT. CANNOT

01:19:29.998 --> 01:19:30.432
OCCUR UNDER THE CURRENT

01:19:30.499 --> 01:19:33.034
CONDITIONS. IF THERE'S TO BE A

01:19:33.101 --> 01:19:35.403
CANNABIS TAX REFORM WHAT WOULD

01:19:35.470 --> 01:19:37.172
THAT LOOK LIKE AND HOW THE

01:19:37.239 --> 01:19:39.908
IMPACT. THAT THE ECONOMIC

01:19:39.975 --> 01:19:41.710
VIABILITY OF THE INDUSTRY THAT'S

01:19:41.776 --> 01:19:43.411
THE SOURCE OF THE CANNABIS TAX

01:19:43.478 --> 01:19:45.247
FUND AND THE PROGRAMS THAT RELY

01:19:45.313 --> 01:19:46.381
ON ITS FUNDING HOW WOULD THAT

01:19:46.448 --> 01:19:51.553
LOOK AT I HEAR THAT YOU- VOICE A

01:19:51.620 --> 01:19:53.221
BIT OF FRUSTRATION THAT- LOCAL

01:19:53.288 --> 01:19:55.190
GOVERNMENTS COULD TAX AT ANY

01:19:55.257 --> 01:19:56.024
LEVEL AND I SHARE THAT

01:19:56.091 --> 01:19:58.627
FRUSTRATION. I DO THINK THAT

01:19:58.693 --> 01:20:01.696
THERE'S A BIG APPETITE TO- TAX

01:20:01.763 --> 01:20:04.032
THE COMPETITIVE NATURE. OF THE

01:20:04.099 --> 01:20:05.367
LEGAL MARKET RIGHT OUT OF THE

01:20:05.433 --> 01:20:06.868
PICTURE AND I THINK TO SOME

01:20:06.935 --> 01:20:09.004
DEGREE THAT'S WHAT OUR PROBLEM.

01:20:09.070 --> 01:20:10.539
IS CURRENTLY WOULD YOU SHARE

01:20:10.605 --> 01:20:15.944
THAT VIEW. I THANK YOU ASSEMBLY

01:20:16.011 --> 01:20:18.480
MEMBER LACKEY FOR THE QUESTION-

01:20:18.547 --> 01:20:21.516
I THINK- IT IT'S- THERE'S

01:20:21.583 --> 01:20:24.052
CERTAINLY A VARIETY OF FACTORS

01:20:24.119 --> 01:20:27.589
AT PLAY WE HAVE NOT CONDUCTED A

01:20:27.656 --> 01:20:31.927
COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OF THE-

01:20:31.993 --> 01:20:34.563
AND- CHALLENGES FACING- THE

01:20:34.629 --> 01:20:36.364
LICENSED CANNABIS INDUSTRY I

01:20:36.431 --> 01:20:38.166
THINK YOU YOU'VE IN YOUR REMARKS

01:20:38.233 --> 01:20:39.834
IDENTIFIED A FEW AS WELL AS SORT

01:20:39.901 --> 01:20:43.371
OF GET THE EARLIER DISCUSSION IN

01:20:43.438 --> 01:20:47.342
HEARING- I. WOULD SAY THERE IS-

01:20:47.409 --> 01:20:52.647
AT. OUR TWENTY NINETEEN REPORT I

01:20:52.714 --> 01:20:55.650
DID EXAMINE ONE SPECIFIC ISSUE

01:20:55.717 --> 01:20:58.019
WHICH WAS THEIR STATEWIDE TAXES

01:20:58.086 --> 01:21:00.055
WITCHER'S STORED AT A FAIR BIT

01:21:00.121 --> 01:21:01.890
OF WHAT WE'RE DISCUSSING NOW AND

01:21:01.957 --> 01:21:06.494
DID FIND THAT- LOWER STATEWIDE

01:21:06.561 --> 01:21:10.799
TAX RATES WOULD- MAKE THE- I

01:21:10.865 --> 01:21:12.701
SINCE MARKET MORE COMPETITIVE

01:21:12.767 --> 01:21:14.436
WITH THE ILLICIT MARKET AND

01:21:14.502 --> 01:21:15.604
THERE ARE CERTAINLY A NUMBER OF

01:21:15.670 --> 01:21:19.441
OTHER POLICY OPTIONS BAKER THAT

01:21:19.507 --> 01:21:20.575
PUTS THINGS IN THAT DIRECTION AS

01:21:20.642 --> 01:21:22.444
WELL. THANK YOU I JUST THINK

01:21:22.510 --> 01:21:24.246
IT'S THAT DESERVES TO BE STATED

01:21:24.312 --> 01:21:27.082
AS LOUDLY AS POSSIBLE. THAT THE

01:21:27.148 --> 01:21:29.217
THOSE WHO ARE TRYING TO COMPLY.

01:21:29.284 --> 01:21:31.119
ARE THE ONES THAT ARE THE ONES

01:21:31.186 --> 01:21:34.589
TO GET MORE. ENFORCEMENT AND I

01:21:34.656 --> 01:21:36.391
FIND THAT TO BE AN ENIGMA WHEN.

01:21:36.458 --> 01:21:37.993
THOSE WHO ARE IN THE ILLICIT

01:21:38.059 --> 01:21:40.762
SPACE SEEM TO HAVE A LOT MORE

01:21:40.829 --> 01:21:42.897
FREEDOM OF ENFORCEMENT AND I

01:21:42.964 --> 01:21:45.200
THINK THAT THAT'S A- MISGUIDED

01:21:45.267 --> 01:21:46.835
AND I THINK THAT WE NEED TO DO

01:21:46.901 --> 01:21:49.704
BETTER AND- SIMPLIFYING. OUR TAX

01:21:49.771 --> 01:21:52.207
STRUCTURE AND- ALLOWING ARE

01:21:52.274 --> 01:21:54.042
THOSE WHO ARE TRYING TO COMPLY

01:21:54.109 --> 01:21:57.212
AND RECOGNIZE THAT AND ALLOW

01:21:57.279 --> 01:22:04.219
THEM TO BE MORE SUCCESSFUL.

THE COMMUTE. WE WOULD FIRST BE

02:10:08.066 --> 02:10:08.734
LOOKING FOR VALUE- THAT WOULD

02:10:08.800 --> 02:10:10.302

OUR COMMUNITY PANEL AND WE WOULD

02:10:15.874 --> 02:10:17.576
HAVE OPENED FORMA DISCUSSION OF

02:10:17.643 --> 02:10:19.211
WHAT ARE THE ISSUES. YOU KNOW

02:10:19.278 --> 02:10:20.312
SOMETIMES A CUT THE IDEA OF THE

02:10:20.379 --> 02:10:21.680
PUBLIC DISTRICT THAT'S ONE THING

02:10:21.747 --> 02:10:24.082
BUT HOW IT'S ACTUALLY BEEN.

02:10:24.149 --> 02:10:24.950
IMPACTING THE COMMUNITY AS A

02:10:25.017 --> 02:10:28.754
MATTER SO WE WANT. TO KNOW THAT

02:10:28.820 --> 02:10:29.354
FROM THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS. I

02:10:29.421 --> 02:10:31.356
WOULD ADD. TO OTHER CREDIT. THE

02:10:31.423 --> 02:10:33.325
ENGAGEMENT AS WELL AS IS THAT

02:10:33.392 --> 02:10:35.093
PARTNERSHIP REALLY FUNCTIONING.

02:10:35.160 --> 02:10:36.195
WHEN WE ORIGINALLY ROLLED OUT

02:10:36.261 --> 02:10:36.962
THE PILOT OF THE CULTURAL

02:10:37.029 --> 02:10:38.697
DISTRICT WE DIDN'T JUST DO AN

02:10:38.764 --> 02:10:40.098
APPLICATION WE DID AND LETTER OF

02:10:40.165 --> 02:10:42.201
INTENT. THEY DID AN APPLICATION

02:10:42.267 --> 02:10:44.203
AND THEN WE DID A SITE VISIT.

02:10:44.269 --> 02:10:45.003
AND WILL BE WITH THE OTHER

02:10:45.070 --> 02:10:46.205
FACTOR THAT WE FOUND OUT THAT

02:10:46.271 --> 02:10:48.373
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WERE

02:10:48.440 --> 02:10:49.641
INDICATED IN THE APPLICATION

02:10:49.708 --> 02:10:50.576
ONE. IMPLEMENTED IN REAL

02:10:50.642 --> 02:10:52.978
RELATIONSHIP AND SO IN THIS CASE

02:10:53.045 --> 02:10:54.379
IF WE DO THE SAME THING. THAT

02:10:54.446 --> 02:10:55.514
THEY DO THE APPLICATION THEY

02:10:55.581 --> 02:10:57.349
WOULD HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE. AND

02:10:57.416 --> 02:10:59.384
SHOW LETTERS OF. PARTNERSHIP BUT

02:10:59.451 --> 02:11:01.119
ALSO THAT WE HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE

02:11:01.186 --> 02:11:07.626
AND PROVE THAT. THROUGH WITH.

02:11:07.693 --> 02:11:09.127
THE CROSS. I THINK WE LEARNED A

02:11:09.194 --> 02:11:10.295
LOT IN THE- BUT WE WOULD ALSO

02:11:10.362 --> 02:11:12.564
INCLUDE IN OUR- OUT OF THIS. I

02:11:12.631 --> 02:11:14.333
WANT. TO EXPAND OUR PARTNERSHIP

02:11:14.399 --> 02:11:15.968
AND I DO WANT TO GET ONE MORE

02:11:16.034 --> 02:11:18.237
CHECK BACK APPLE TO. ONE OTHER

02:11:18.303 --> 02:11:19.938
THING WHEN WE FIRST ROLLED OUT

02:11:20.005 --> 02:11:22.174
THE PA. WE DO NOT HAVE GOOD.

02:11:22.241 --> 02:11:24.443

CAN MAKE SURE THAT WE HAD MORE

02:11:32.884 --> 02:11:34.119
DIVERSITY AND I CAN'T JUST FOR

02:11:34.186 --> 02:11:34.987
THE FOURTEEN THAT'S A VERY SMALL

02:11:35.053 --> 02:11:36.188
GROUP BUT WE USED OUR OWN. THEIR

02:11:36.255 --> 02:11:38.023

WE WOULD- ALSO. A PLAN AND

02:38:45.816 --> 02:38:47.384
REACHING OUT. OKAY I SURE THAT

02:38:47.451 --> 02:38:50.053
BECAUSE- BROADBAND. CLEARLY IS A

02:38:50.120 --> 02:38:52.356
PRIORITY TO ALL MEMBERS IN THE

02:38:52.422 --> 02:38:54.558
LEGISLATURE BOTH AND RURAL. AND

02:38:54.625 --> 02:38:56.793
URBAN AREAS GIVEN THE LAST TWO

02:38:56.860 --> 02:38:59.897
YEARS OF CODED. WE HAVE SEEN-

02:38:59.963 --> 02:39:03.000
REALLY HOWL. LACK OF AXIS HAS

02:39:03.066 --> 02:39:04.902
IMPACTED STUDENTS. THE

02:39:04.968 --> 02:39:06.637
ACHIEVEMENT GAP IS ONLY GROWING

02:39:06.703 --> 02:39:08.505
BIGGER. AND SO WHETHER YOU ARE

02:39:08.572 --> 02:39:10.874
IN THE INNER CITY LIKE ME AND

02:39:10.941 --> 02:39:12.743
STILL HAVE A DISTRICT THAT IS

02:39:12.809 --> 02:39:14.177
20% BELOW THE NATIONAL POVERTY

02:39:14.244 --> 02:39:16.179
LINE. AND NOT HAVING ACCESS TO

02:39:16.246 --> 02:39:17.714
BROADBAND OR WHETHER YOU ARE IN

02:39:17.781 --> 02:39:19.349
THE CENTRAL VALLEY OR ANY OTHER

02:39:19.416 --> 02:39:21.985
AREA. WE UNDERSTAND THAT THIS

02:39:22.052 --> 02:39:25.656
NEED IS REALLY ABOUT EQUITY. AND

02:39:25.722 --> 02:39:26.623
IT REALLY IS ABOUT ENSURING

02:39:26.690 --> 02:39:29.192
THAT. ACCESS TO BROADBAND GIVEN

02:39:29.259 --> 02:39:30.127
THE TECHNOLOGY IN THE WORLD THAT

02:39:30.193 --> 02:39:31.962
WE LIVE IN. THIS ACCESSIBLE TO

02:39:32.029 --> 02:39:34.064
ALL AND SO I THINK IT WOULD BE.

02:39:34.131 --> 02:39:35.365
IN THE BEST INTEREST OF. THE

02:39:35.432 --> 02:39:36.767
AGENCY AS WELL AS THE

02:39:36.833 --> 02:39:38.101
LEGISLATORS TO UNDERSTAND AND

02:39:38.168 --> 02:39:40.370
KNOW. HOW THIS IS BEING IMPACTED

02:39:40.437 --> 02:39:42.239
AND IMPLEMENTED IN THEIR

02:39:42.306 --> 02:39:43.106
COMMUNITY AND IN THEIR

02:39:43.173 --> 02:39:44.641

PRETTY MUCH OKAY MY QUESTIONS

02:40:02.092 --> 02:40:04.294
ARE DIRECTED TOWARDS- CDT AND MR

02:40:04.361 --> 02:40:07.130
MORALE THE NOVEMBER OF TWENTY

TWO FORTY SEVEN FROM HIGH DESERT

02:40:21.311 --> 02:40:25.015
BARSTOW TO A PLACE CALLED. BORN

02:40:25.082 --> 02:40:26.249
MY QUESTION MY FIRST QUESTION IS

02:40:26.316 --> 02:40:27.818
HOW MANY UNSERVED HOUSEHOLDS. IN

02:40:27.884 --> 02:40:31.254
THIS AREA. ARE IN THIS AREA AND

02:40:31.321 --> 02:40:32.622
WILL BE CONNECTED TO THE LAST

02:40:32.689 --> 02:40:34.324
MILE FACILITIES AS A RESULT OF

02:40:34.391 --> 02:40:35.959
THIS MIDDLE MILE NETWORK

02:40:36.026 --> 02:40:38.595
LOCATION. YOU HAVE ANY IDEA.

02:40:38.662 --> 02:40:39.863
YEAH I'M SORRY I DON'T HAVE THAT

02:40:39.930 --> 02:40:41.832
NUMBER FOR YOU I KNOW THAT WE

02:40:41.898 --> 02:40:45.335
TRACK THAT- TO YOUR POINT- YOU

02:40:45.402 --> 02:40:47.404
KNOW WHEN WE BUILD MIDDLE MILE-

02:40:47.471 --> 02:40:49.139
YOU KNOW WE REMIND. PEOPLE THAT

02:40:49.206 --> 02:40:50.607
THAT MIDDLE MILE DOESN'T YOU

02:40:50.674 --> 02:40:52.976
KNOW THAT GETS THE BROADBAND TO

02:40:53.043 --> 02:40:55.512
A COMMUNITY- AND SO- WHEN WE

02:40:55.579 --> 02:40:57.047
LOOK AT THE POTENTIAL

02:40:57.114 --> 02:40:59.449
COMMUNITIES THERE- ON THE ON THE

02:40:59.516 --> 02:41:00.417
PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION'S

02:41:00.484 --> 02:41:02.219
MAPS. THAT'S WHERE WE WOULD

02:41:02.285 --> 02:41:04.488
IDENTIFY THAT- THE NUMBERS ARE

02:41:04.554 --> 02:41:05.555
COMMUNITIES THAT ARE ALONG THOSE

02:41:05.622 --> 02:41:06.990
ROUTES THAT WOULD EVENT THAT

02:41:07.057 --> 02:41:09.526
COULD EVENTUALLY BE SERVED- BUT

02:41:09.593 --> 02:41:11.661
THEN THERE. THERE'S THE

02:41:11.728 --> 02:41:13.764
SUBSEQUENT PROCESS FOR THAT NOT

02:41:13.830 --> 02:41:15.198
EVEN SUBSEQUENT BECAUSE BUT AS

02:41:15.265 --> 02:41:17.200
FAR NOTABLE MISTRUST BORN THERE

02:41:17.267 --> 02:41:19.369
ARE A- THAT- SEVENTEEN YEARS

02:41:19.436 --> 02:41:21.204
PROCESS OF THAT THAT THE PUBLIC

02:41:21.271 --> 02:41:21.905
UTILITIES COMMISSION IS GOING

02:41:21.972 --> 02:41:23.373
THROUGH HER DEFINING THOSE LAST

02:41:23.440 --> 02:41:25.909
MILE PROJECTS. BUT BUT IN TERMS

02:41:25.976 --> 02:41:28.678
OF THE NUMBER. OF HOUSEHOLDS- WE

02:41:28.745 --> 02:41:31.448
CAN CIRCLE BACK ON THAT- I KNOW.

02:41:31.515 --> 02:41:34.284
WE HAVE WE HAVE AN ESTIMATE. BUT

02:41:34.351 --> 02:41:35.018
BUT I DON'T HAVE THAT WITH ME.

02:41:35.085 --> 02:41:36.987
K. MANY OF THESE QUESTIONS THAT

02:41:37.054 --> 02:41:38.355
I'M GUESSING YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE

02:41:38.422 --> 02:41:40.190
THE ANSWER TO BUT I WOULD HOPE

02:41:40.257 --> 02:41:41.825
THAT YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET

02:41:41.892 --> 02:41:42.726
THEM TO US. I BECAUSE THEY'RE

02:41:42.793 --> 02:41:44.094
THEY'RE VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE

02:41:44.161 --> 02:41:45.295
OF MY FOLLOW UP QUESTION WOULD

02:41:45.362 --> 02:41:47.030
BE DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT THE

02:41:47.097 --> 02:41:48.031
COST WOULD BE OF DEPLOYING THE

02:41:48.098 --> 02:41:53.470
MIDDLE MILE NETWORK. IN THAT

02:41:53.537 --> 02:41:54.071
LOCATION AND I JUST REFER TO.

02:41:54.137 --> 02:41:55.338
I'M GUESSING PROBABLY TO. ARE

02:41:55.405 --> 02:41:56.706
PREPARED FOR THAT ANSWER. RIGHT

02:41:56.773 --> 02:41:59.276
OKAY- I ALSO WANT TO ASK ABOUT

02:41:59.342 --> 02:42:00.844
THIS PROJECT RELATIONSHIP TO THE

02:42:00.911 --> 02:42:02.846
DIGITAL THREE NINETY FIVE

02:42:02.913 --> 02:42:04.748
PROJECT DUE TO ITS LOCATION AND

02:42:04.815 --> 02:42:06.950
THAT DIGITAL THREE NINETY FIVE

02:42:07.017 --> 02:42:08.819
PROJECT WAS COMPLETED IN TWENTY

02:42:08.885 --> 02:42:10.754
FOURTEEN I CONNECTED ABOUT TWO

02:42:10.821 --> 02:42:12.489
HUNDRED AND FIFTY ONE ACRE

02:42:12.556 --> 02:42:13.957
INSTITUTIONS BUT IT'S UNCERTAIN

02:42:14.024 --> 02:42:16.593
HOW MANY PREVIOUSLY UNSERVED

02:42:16.660 --> 02:42:18.695
HOUSEHOLDS HAVE BECOME CONNECTED

02:42:18.762 --> 02:42:19.763
. FOR EXAMPLE ALL SEVEN INDIAN

02:42:19.830 --> 02:42:21.731
RESERVATIONS IN THE DIGITAL

02:42:21.798 --> 02:42:23.066
THREE NINETY FIVE QUARTER MAY

02:42:23.133 --> 02:42:23.934
HAVE. A CENTRAL FFICE

02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:26.036
CONNECTION BUT MOST INDIVIDUAL

02:42:26.103 --> 02:42:28.071
HOMES STILL DO NOT HAVE LAST

02:42:28.138 --> 02:42:30.740
MILE SERVICE. AND MY NEXT

02:42:30.807 --> 02:42:32.275
QUESTION WOULD BE PREDICTABLE

02:42:32.342 --> 02:42:33.710
HOW HOW WOULD YOU ENSURE THAT

02:42:33.777 --> 02:42:34.945
THE NEW STATE MIDDLE MILE

02:42:35.011 --> 02:42:36.513
NETWORK INCLUDING THE BAR

02:42:36.580 --> 02:42:38.014
STARTED TOWARD ROUTE. WELL

02:42:38.081 --> 02:42:39.983
ACTION RESULT IN LAST MILE

02:42:40.050 --> 02:42:43.487
CONNECTIONS. TO THESE UNSERVED

02:42:43.553 --> 02:42:44.087
HOUSEHOLDS BECAUSE THAT'S THE

02:42:44.154 --> 02:42:46.723
THAT'S THE GOAL. ABSOLUTELY AND

02:42:46.790 --> 02:42:48.291
THAT'S REALLY WHERE I THINK THAT

02:42:48.358 --> 02:42:49.025
THE PUBLIC UTILITIES

02:42:49.092 --> 02:42:50.627
COMMISSIONS- THE FUNDING

02:42:50.694 --> 02:42:52.028
PROVIDED BY THE LEGISLATURE FOR

02:42:52.095 --> 02:42:53.930
THIS LAST MILE- ACCOUNTS THAT

02:42:53.997 --> 02:42:55.499
PROJECTS AND THE PUBLIC UTILITY

02:42:55.565 --> 02:42:56.900
CAN UTILITIES COMMISSIONS

02:42:56.967 --> 02:42:59.503
PROCESS FOR. ADMINISTERING THOSE

02:42:59.569 --> 02:43:01.638
GRANTS IS GOING TO BE HELPFUL-

02:43:01.705 --> 02:43:04.841
WE KNOW THAT- MORE BROADLY- THE

02:43:04.908 --> 02:43:06.843
PROVIDERS HAVE BEEN RELUCTANT TO

02:43:06.910 --> 02:43:09.279
FUND THE COST- IN A LOT OF CASES

02:43:09.346 --> 02:43:11.581
OF. BOTH THAT THAT MIDDLE MILE

02:43:11.648 --> 02:43:12.549
SEGMENT TO GET OUT TO THAT LAST

02:43:12.616 --> 02:43:15.919
MILE SO- WE KNOW THAT- WHEN

02:43:15.986 --> 02:43:17.621
SIMILAR MARKETS TODAY ANNOUNCED

02:43:17.687 --> 02:43:19.422
WHERE I'VE BEEN REALLY CREATES-

02:43:19.489 --> 02:43:20.624
A AND IT'S MUCH MORE OF AN

02:43:20.690 --> 02:43:22.859
INCENTIVE- FOR LAST MILE

02:43:22.926 --> 02:43:25.328
PROVIDERS TO BECOME INVOLVED AND

02:43:25.395 --> 02:43:27.097
TO WORK. TO BUILD OUT THEIR

02:43:27.164 --> 02:43:28.899
SERVICE BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE

02:43:28.965 --> 02:43:30.700
THE ADDED COST OF BUILDING UP

02:43:30.767 --> 02:43:32.302
THAT MIDDLE MILE. SO WE KNOW

02:43:32.369 --> 02:43:34.271
THAT CERTAIN ALTERNATIVE MARKET

02:43:34.337 --> 02:43:36.072
WILL HELP US ALL FOR THAT AS

DIGITAL THREE NINETY FIVE. BE

02:43:58.495 --> 02:44:00.463
AWARE WHETHER THAT'S A REALITY

02:44:00.530 --> 02:44:09.839
OR NOT- YES I BELIEVE. THERE

02:44:09.906 --> 02:44:11.241
THERE'S THE EIGHTEEN PROJECTS

02:44:11.308 --> 02:44:12.309
WHICH WERE DONE PRIMARILY TO

02:44:12.375 --> 02:44:16.012
LEARN RIGHT I MEAN WE HAD A THEY

02:44:16.079 --> 02:44:17.714
WERE AREAS WHERE AT THE- THE

02:44:17.781 --> 02:44:19.182
PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION HAD

02:44:19.249 --> 02:44:20.951
GONE FAR ENOUGH AND IN THEIR

02:44:21.017 --> 02:44:24.087
ANALYSIS TO BE ABLE TO BE

02:44:24.154 --> 02:44:25.989
CERTAIN THAT THERE WAS- INDEED

02:44:26.056 --> 02:44:27.390
THERE THERE WAS A SOLUTION WAS

02:44:27.457 --> 02:44:31.161
NEEDED AND SO WE MOVED FORWARD

02:44:31.228 --> 02:44:32.862
WITH THEM- ABSOLUTELY HERE IN.

LIKE. AND SO THAT'S WHERE WE GET

02:44:39.469 --> 02:44:42.138
A BETTER IDEA OF- OF CONNECTED

02:44:42.205 --> 02:44:44.374
BUT IN THE END. WE'RE BUILDING A

02:44:44.441 --> 02:44:46.776

IDENTIFYING THE EIGHTEEN

SERVICE THAT WOULD BE- ERROR FOR

02:46:44.627 --> 02:46:46.262
AREAS THAT MOVE A PROJECT THAT

02:46:46.329 --> 02:46:47.464
HAD BEEN FUNDED. OR WE'RE GOING

02:46:47.530 --> 02:46:50.533
TO BE FUNDED- BUT REALLY- THAT

02:46:50.600 --> 02:46:51.701
THE CONNECTIVITY IS GOING TO

02:46:51.768 --> 02:46:55.505
COME WHEN WE BUILT THE REST AND

02:46:55.572 --> 02:46:57.240
IT ALL. TIES TOGETHER. AND SO

02:46:57.307 --> 02:46:59.409

02:47:22.799 --> 02:47:24.634
A COMMUNITY- THEN YOU PROBABLY

02:47:24.701 --> 02:47:26.469
YOU MAY NOT HAVE GONE THROUGH

02:47:26.536 --> 02:47:28.271
THE PROCESS OF IDENTIFYING WHAT

TO DATE THE PROJECT IS

02:51:15.465 --> 02:51:16.866
ARGUMENTATIVE OVER SEVENTY

02:51:16.933 --> 02:51:18.768
DIFFERENT LESSONS LEARNED THAT

02:51:18.835 --> 02:51:20.470
SPANNED MAJOR CATEGORIES SUCH AS

02:51:20.536 --> 02:51:22.205
THOSE RAISED BY THE TASK FORCE

02:51:22.271 --> 02:51:24.374
ON RE ENGINEERING IT PROCUREMENT

02:51:24.440 --> 02:51:26.376
FOR SUCCESS. ALL THE WAY DOWN TO

02:51:26.442 --> 02:51:28.745
HOW TO RUN A BETTER VIRTUAL

02:51:28.811 --> 02:51:30.113
REQUIREMENTS VALIDATION SESSION

02:51:30.179 --> 02:51:31.981
. TOPPING THIS LIST IS

02:51:32.048 --> 02:51:34.083
ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE MANAGEMENT

02:51:34.150 --> 02:51:35.184
. THE PROJECT TRACKS THESE

02:51:35.251 --> 02:51:36.786
LESSONS AND CONTINUES TO REVIEW

02:51:36.853 --> 02:51:39.022
ITS WORK AS A PERFORMS AT AND

02:51:39.088 --> 02:51:40.890
ADJUST AS NEEDED TO ACHIEVE

02:51:40.957 --> 02:51:44.394
BETTER OUTCOMES. WHAT WE LEARNED

02:51:44.460 --> 02:51:45.828
FROM OUR RESEARCH WAS THAT WE

02:51:45.895 --> 02:51:48.197
MUST HAVE CLEARLY DOCUMENTED

02:51:48.264 --> 02:51:48.798
REQUIREMENTS BEFORE BEGINNING

02:51:48.865 --> 02:51:51.467
PROCUREMENT. THIS KEY ELEMENT

02:51:51.534 --> 02:51:53.469
WAS MISSING FROM PAST EFFORTS.

02:51:53.536 --> 02:51:54.737
BUT WE DIDN'T START BY READING

02:51:54.804 --> 02:51:57.173
REQUIREMENTS INSTEAD WE STARTED

02:51:57.240 --> 02:51:59.008
BY DOCUMENTING OUR CURRENT

02:51:59.075 --> 02:52:00.176
BUSINESS PROCESSES FROM END TO

02:52:00.243 --> 02:52:02.245
END. AND WE CLOSELY EXAMINE

02:52:02.311 --> 02:52:04.213
THOSE PROCESSES SEEKING WAYS TO

02:52:04.280 --> 02:52:06.416
IMPROVE THEM. WITH THIS SUBJECT

02:52:06.482 --> 02:52:08.217
MATTER EXPERTS TO NEARLY FORTY

02:52:08.284 --> 02:52:10.219
DIFFERENT STATE DEPARTMENTS WE

02:52:10.286 --> 02:52:12.455
PUT THE PROJECT DOCUMENTED OUR

02:52:12.522 --> 02:52:14.490
FUTURE STATE BUSINESS PROCESSES

02:52:14.557 --> 02:52:16.025
AND THEN WROTE MID LEVEL IN

02:52:16.092 --> 02:52:17.527
DETAIL REQUIREMENTS FOLLOWED BY

02:52:17.593 --> 02:52:20.263
EVEN MORE DETAIL BUSINESS RULES.

02:52:20.329 --> 02:52:22.031
AS WE ALL KNOW THE DEVIL'S IN

02:52:22.098 --> 02:52:23.766
THE DETAILS AND THE CULMINATION

02:52:23.833 --> 02:52:25.368
OF THIS ACTIVITY HAS RESULTED IN

02:52:25.435 --> 02:52:27.570
QUITE AN EXQUISITE SIDE OF

02:52:27.637 --> 02:52:29.272
REQUIREMENTS. LESSONS LEARNED

02:52:29.338 --> 02:52:31.074
ALSO INFORMED US THAT REDUCING

02:52:31.140 --> 02:52:33.509
COMPLEXITY IS KEY TO ACHIEVING

02:52:33.576 --> 02:52:34.844
OUR OBJECTIVES IN THE

02:52:34.911 --> 02:52:37.447
REQUIREMENTS WE DEVELOP REFLECTS

02:52:37.513 --> 02:52:39.182
SIGNIFICANT COMPLEXITY REDUCTION

02:52:39.248 --> 02:52:40.783
. THIS ONE LESSON IS CRITICALLY

02:52:40.850 --> 02:52:42.552
IMPORTANT BECAUSE ONE STATE

02:52:42.618 --> 02:52:44.554
CONFORMS TO STANDARD PRACTICES

02:52:44.620 --> 02:52:46.055
THE COMPLEXITY OF THE SYSTEM IS

02:52:46.122 --> 02:52:48.057
ALSO REDUCED WHICH INCREASES THE

02:52:48.124 --> 02:52:49.392
PROBABILITY OF A SUCCESSFUL

02:52:49.459 --> 02:52:51.527
IMPLEMENTATION. AND REDUCES

02:52:51.594 --> 02:52:54.630
ONGOING OPERATIONAL EXPENSE.

02:52:54.697 --> 02:52:56.365
PAUL ROBUST AND RIGOROUS TESTING

02:52:56.432 --> 02:52:58.367
OF COURSE WILL OCCUR DURING THE

02:52:58.434 --> 02:53:00.403
EXECUTION PHASE OF THIS PROJECT

02:53:00.470 --> 02:53:02.138
WE'RE FOLLOWING THIS PRINCIPAL

02:53:02.205 --> 02:53:03.573
DURING PROCUREMENT AS WELL.

02:53:03.639 --> 02:53:04.674
PERSPECTIVE VENDORS WILL BE

02:53:04.741 --> 02:53:06.075
REQUIRED TO SHOW HOW THEIR

02:53:06.142 --> 02:53:06.909
PRODUCT WILL MEET OUR

02:53:06.976 --> 02:53:08.978
REQUIREMENTS THROUGH PROOF OF

02:53:09.045 --> 02:53:09.746
CONCEPT PHASE OF THE

02:53:09.812 --> 02:53:11.547
PROCUREMENT. WHERE THE STATE

OVERHEAD COSTS THIS LIST TO

COVER THE OVERHEAD. COMPONENT

03:12:15.490 --> 03:12:17.158
AND THE INTER COMPONENT- IT

03:12:17.225 --> 03:12:19.628

PRIMARILY A COST RECOVERY

03:12:24.399 --> 03:12:27.669
ORGANIZATION- WHEN I CAME TO SEE

03:12:27.736 --> 03:12:29.070
TO TAKE FOUR YEARS AGO WE WERE

03:12:29.137 --> 03:12:32.274

RABBIT HOLE THAT IS GOING TO BE

03:13:00.001 --> 03:13:04.673

OTHER PLACES THAT NATURE- IT IS

03:13:16.551 --> 03:13:18.119
A FAIRLY HIGH BECAUSE IT RUNS A

03:13:18.186 --> 03:13:19.387
DATA CENTER WITH A FAIRLY HIGH

03:13:19.454 --> 03:13:20.622
FIXED COST STRUCTURE JUST TO

SHORT RUN SO WHEN WE WHEN WE

03:13:43.812 --> 03:13:44.980
HAVE CUSTOMERS A LEAK. WE LOSE

03:13:45.046 --> 03:13:46.448
THE REVENUE BUT WE CAN'T

03:13:46.514 --> 03:13:49.117

LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT CONTINUES

03:14:55.283 --> 03:14:55.750
THROUGH THE ANNUAL BUDGET

03:14:55.817 --> 03:14:57.485
PROCESS. OF THE GOVERNOR'S

03:14:57.552 --> 03:14:59.454

ADDRESS REVENUE LOSSES BUT A

03:15:07.062 --> 03:15:08.963
DECLINING CUSTOMER BASE FOR THE

DEPARTMENT STATE DATA CENTER.

03:15:10.932 --> 03:15:11.866
ONE REASON APPEARS TO BE SOME

STATE DATA CENTER RATES ARE NOT

03:15:13.735 --> 03:15:15.837
COMPETITIVELY PRICED. ANOTHER

03:15:15.904 --> 03:15:17.806
REASON IS DIRECT RATE COMPARISON

03:15:17.872 --> 03:15:19.307
BETWEEN PRIVATE VENDORS AND THE

03:15:19.374 --> 03:15:21.042

ANTICIPATED RATE REEVALUATION

03:15:34.289 --> 03:15:37.092
PROCESS THAT IS EXPECTED TO.

03:15:37.158 --> 03:15:39.127
ADDITIONAL REVENUE LOSSES AND

03:15:39.194 --> 03:15:41.096
MAKES THE DATA CENTER RATES MORE

03:15:41.162 --> 03:15:42.964
COMPETITIVE. BASED ON OUR

03:15:43.031 --> 03:15:43.731
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE

03:29:53.948 --> 03:29:55.716
MAKE AN APPOINTMENT. IF THEY

03:29:55.783 --> 03:29:57.418
DIDN'T SPEAK ENGLISH THEY WERE

03:29:57.484 --> 03:29:59.286
CERTAINLY CUT OFF BECAUSE OF

03:29:59.353 --> 03:30:01.689
LACK OF LANGUAGE ACCESS. AND SO

03:30:01.755 --> 03:30:03.424
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT A CENTER FOR

03:30:03.490 --> 03:30:04.658
GOVERNMENT EXCELLENCE I'M

03:30:04.725 --> 03:30:06.894
CURIOUS AS TO WHAT THAT ACTUALLY

03:30:06.961 --> 03:30:08.963
LOOKS LIKE BECAUSE THIS. FIRST

03:30:09.029 --> 03:30:11.799
FACILITY. WAS IN MY DISTRICTBUT

03:30:11.865 --> 03:30:13.867
IT WAS NOT FOR MY DISTRICT AND

03:30:13.934 --> 03:30:16.937
SO I THINK. I WANT TO POINT OUT

03:30:17.004 --> 03:30:18.839
HOW WILL THE CENTER ACTUALLY

03:30:18.906 --> 03:30:20.574
CREATE AN OPPORTUNITY IN WHICH

03:30:20.641 --> 03:30:22.843
GOVERNMENT TREATS CONSTITUENTS

03:30:22.910 --> 03:30:24.778
AND THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA AND

03:30:24.845 --> 03:30:29.917
MORE EQUITABLE WAY. THANK YOU

03:30:29.984 --> 03:30:31.518

I'M SURE AND THANK YOU MEMBERS

03:30:33.587 --> 03:30:35.723
OF THE COMMITTEE- THAT IS

03:30:35.789 --> 03:30:37.324
SOMETHING THAT WE COULD LOOK AT

03:30:37.391 --> 03:30:40.661
IN IN THE SHAPE OF A PILOT-

03:30:40.728 --> 03:30:42.963
WHERE WE COULD SEE WHERE.

03:30:43.030 --> 03:30:45.132
LOOKING AT PROBLEMS IN PLACE TO

03:30:45.199 --> 03:30:48.736
OUR- CREATE GREATER ACCESS AND

03:30:48.802 --> 03:30:50.804
TO CREATE ACCESS ON A- MORE

03:30:50.871 --> 03:30:52.506
REGULAR AND CONSISTENT BASIS I

03:30:52.573 --> 03:30:54.641
MEAN WE'VE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT-

03:30:54.708 --> 03:30:56.443
REACHING OUT TO HARD TO FIND

03:30:56.510 --> 03:30:57.745
COMMUNITIES THROUGH OUR SENSES

03:30:57.811 --> 03:30:59.913
WORK- AS WELL THROUGH. THE

03:30:59.980 --> 03:31:02.549
VACCINATION WORK THAT ARE-

03:31:02.616 --> 03:31:05.586
SECRETARY LED TO- AS WELL AS THE

EMERGENCY BROADBAND. OF BENEFIT

03:31:09.056 --> 03:31:11.258
BUT- THE CENTER WOULD UP TO TAKE

03:31:11.325 --> 03:31:12.993
THOSE LESSONS. AND TO PUT THEM

03:31:13.060 --> 03:31:14.695
IN A WAY THAT COULD BE MORE

03:31:14.762 --> 03:31:16.563
EASILY SHARED ACROSS GOVERNMENT

03:31:16.630 --> 03:31:17.798
. EITHER THROUGH A PILOT OR

03:31:17.865 --> 03:31:21.368
THROUGH- A CASE STUDY OR A BEST

03:31:21.435 --> 03:31:24.304
PRACTICES DOCUMENT. BUT PART OF

03:31:24.371 --> 03:31:25.272
THE POWER OF HAVING THE

03:31:25.339 --> 03:31:27.207
PARTICULARLY IN IN THE AGENCY

03:31:27.274 --> 03:31:29.777
LEVEL. IS TO- THE ABILITY TO

03:31:29.843 --> 03:31:33.347
COORDINATE AND CONVENE. AND THAT

03:31:33.414 --> 03:31:33.981
THAT'S WHERE WE CAN GET PEOPLE

03:31:34.048 --> 03:31:36.050
FROM THE OUTSIDE. AS WELL AS

03:31:36.116 --> 03:31:38.285
PEOPLE FROM WITHIN THE STATE TO

03:31:38.352 --> 03:31:38.952
KIND OF WORK THROUGH THESE

03:31:39.019 --> 03:31:42.689
ISSUES AND COME UP. WITH A- THE

03:31:42.756 --> 03:31:45.092
STRATEGY PARTICULARLY ONE OF THE

03:31:45.159 --> 03:31:47.161
KEY PIECES OF THE GET CENTER IS

03:31:47.227 --> 03:31:48.195
THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE CONTROL

03:31:48.262 --> 03:31:51.565
AGENCIES- AND TO GET THEM TO

03:31:51.632 --> 03:31:52.800
COORDINATE. AND ALIGN THEIR

03:31:52.866 --> 03:31:55.636
THEIR- THEIR PRIORITIES AND THIS

03:31:55.702 --> 03:31:57.604
IS A WAY WE COULD BUILD-

03:31:57.671 --> 03:32:00.507
INFRASTRUCTURE IN TERMS OF

03:32:00.574 --> 03:32:03.477
REGULATIONS AND STANDARDS. AND

03:32:03.544 --> 03:32:06.980
GUIDANCE- CHU CHU TAKE A BETTER

03:32:07.047 --> 03:32:11.485
AND MORE EFFECTIVE- YOU KNOW.

03:32:11.552 --> 03:32:14.321
BUT ABILITY TO DO THIS KIND

03:32:14.388 --> 03:32:16.123
ABOUT REGION CERTAIN PEOPLE WITH

03:32:16.190 --> 03:32:18.859
I MEAN THIS IS- THIS IS

03:32:18.926 --> 03:32:19.626
SOMETHING WE ARE VERY CONCERNED

03:32:19.693 --> 03:32:22.029
ABOUT A WITH WITH- THE WHOLE

03:32:22.096 --> 03:32:24.298
BROADBAND ISSUE WHICH WE NEED TO

03:32:24.364 --> 03:32:24.932
BE ABLE TO REACH INTO

03:32:24.998 --> 03:32:27.301
COMMUNITIES- AND DIFFERENT HAVE

03:32:27.367 --> 03:32:28.936
DIGITAL SERVICES AND ASK PEOPLE

TO USE- YOU KNOW MODERN

03:32:30.971 --> 03:32:33.240
TECHNOLOGIES WE HAVE TO BE ABLE

03:32:33.307 --> 03:32:34.074
TO REACH THEM AND THEY HAVE TO

03:32:34.141 --> 03:32:35.576
BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE. IN

03:32:35.642 --> 03:32:38.345
CALIFORNIA- GOVERNMENT CULTURE

03:32:38.412 --> 03:32:40.481
AS AS AS WELL AS ANYBODY WHO

03:32:40.547 --> 03:32:44.985
LIVES WITH WITH VERY QUICK AND-

03:32:45.052 --> 03:32:47.321
THANK YOU FOR THAT ANSWER I. YOU

03:32:47.387 --> 03:32:48.822
KNOW I THINK IT'S- IT'S

03:32:48.889 --> 03:32:50.224
INTERESTING TO CREATE A NEW

03:32:50.290 --> 03:32:51.825
CENTER FOR GOVERNMENT THE CENTER

03:32:51.892 --> 03:32:53.627
FOR GOVERNMENT EXCELLENCE AND IT

03:32:53.694 --> 03:32:55.496
SOUNDS REALLY GREAT. BUT YOU

03:32:55.562 --> 03:32:56.864
DON'T NEED TO CREATE A CENTER TO

03:32:56.930 --> 03:32:57.998
BE ABLE TO WORK WITH THE

03:32:58.065 --> 03:32:59.333
LEGISLATURE THAT CAN TELL YOU

03:32:59.399 --> 03:33:00.734
DIRECTLY HOW COLD IT IS

03:33:00.801 --> 03:33:02.903
IMPACTING OUR COMMUNITIES. I

03:33:02.970 --> 03:33:04.471
THINK THE YOU SPOKE ABOUT A

03:33:04.538 --> 03:33:06.473
COORDINATED EFFORT WITH THIS

03:33:06.540 --> 03:33:10.110
PARTICULAR- CENTER. BUT THE

03:33:10.177 --> 03:33:11.078
COORDINATED EFFORT IN THE

03:33:11.145 --> 03:33:12.980
OPPORTUNITY ALREADY EXISTS IF

03:33:13.046 --> 03:33:14.414
THE ADMINISTRATION SIMPLY

03:33:14.481 --> 03:33:15.682
ACTUALLY COORDINATED AND

03:33:15.749 --> 03:33:18.585
COMMUNICATED. NEEDS AND GOALS

03:33:18.652 --> 03:33:20.454
WHAT THE LEGISLATURE AND THE

03:33:20.521 --> 03:33:21.121
MEMBERS THAT REPRESENT THESE

03:33:21.188 --> 03:33:24.291
COMMUNITIES. AND SO I SAW THAT

03:33:24.358 --> 03:33:26.994
THAT WAS A COMPLETE- LACK OF

03:33:27.060 --> 03:33:28.662
SAFETY NET FOR MANY OF US

03:33:28.729 --> 03:33:29.830
ESPECIALLY THOSE THOSE

03:33:29.897 --> 03:33:31.064
COMMUNITIES THAT WERE HIT

03:33:31.131 --> 03:33:32.166
HARDEST BY COLD AT MINE

03:33:32.232 --> 03:33:34.234
INCLUDED. I REPRESENTATIVE SAID

03:33:34.301 --> 03:33:35.335
IT MULTIPLE TIMES IN THIS

03:33:35.402 --> 03:33:37.271
HEARING. I REPRESENT A COMMUNITY

03:33:37.337 --> 03:33:38.906
THAT HAS TWENTY PERCENT. BELOW

03:33:38.972 --> 03:33:41.241
THE NATIONAL POVERTY LINE MAKES

03:33:41.308 --> 03:33:43.277
STATUS UNDOCUMENTED FAMILIES.

03:33:43.343 --> 03:33:45.078
THE CENSUS COUNT WAS INCREDIBLY

03:33:45.145 --> 03:33:46.246
LOW IN OUR COMMUNITY SO WE KNOW

03:33:46.313 --> 03:33:47.781
THAT THE RESOURCES ARE NOT GOING

03:33:47.848 --> 03:33:49.583
TO BE THERE ON THE FEDERAL

03:33:49.650 --> 03:33:50.450
LEVEL. WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE

03:33:50.517 --> 03:33:51.552
OUT WAYS IN WHICH THE STATE CAN

03:33:51.618 --> 03:33:55.155
BE RESPONSIVE. AND YET. BASIC

03:33:55.222 --> 03:33:57.057
SOLUTIONS LIKE. COMMUNITY

03:33:57.124 --> 03:33:59.226
CLINICS OR SCHOOL SITES THAT

03:33:59.293 --> 03:34:00.894
ENABLE BETTER ABLE TO PROVIDE

03:34:00.961 --> 03:34:04.298
WALKABLE. CLOSE OPPORTUNITIES

03:34:04.364 --> 03:34:06.166
FOR MULTI GENERATIONAL FAMILIES

03:34:06.233 --> 03:34:08.135
TO BE ABLE TO GET TESTED AND GET

03:34:08.202 --> 03:34:11.004
THE VACCINE. DIDN'T EXIST UNTIL

03:34:11.071 --> 03:34:13.006
WE PUSHED AND PUSHED AND PUSHED.

03:34:13.073 --> 03:34:15.642
AND SO IT'S BEEN IT'S BEEN

03:34:15.709 --> 03:34:17.911
INTERESTING TO SAY THE LEAST. TO

03:34:17.978 --> 03:34:19.479
TRY TO FIND EQUITABLE SOLUTIONS

03:34:19.546 --> 03:34:21.148
THAT THOSE OF US TO COME FROM

03:34:21.215 --> 03:34:22.950
THE DISTRICT THAT WE REPRESENT.

03:34:23.016 --> 03:34:26.220
CAN QUICKLY ARTICULATE- IN NEED

03:34:26.286 --> 03:34:28.622
AND RESOURCES AND YET HERE WE

03:34:28.689 --> 03:34:30.190
ARE CREATING MORE DEPARTMENTS TO

03:34:30.257 --> 03:34:32.793
CREATE DATA TO CREATE

03:34:32.859 --> 03:34:33.527
COORDINATED EFFORTS. WHEN WE

03:34:33.594 --> 03:34:35.462
COULD HAVE DONE IT SOONER AND SO

03:34:35.529 --> 03:34:37.064
FOR ME I WANT TO ASK YOU THE

03:34:37.130 --> 03:34:40.033

WORK WELL IN AND HOW DO WE SCALE

03:35:02.089 --> 03:35:03.857
ENACTMENT COLUSA LANGUAGE ACCESS

03:35:03.924 --> 03:35:05.325
SOME DEPARTMENTS DO A LOT BETTER

03:35:05.392 --> 03:35:07.160
THAN OTHERS AT LANGUAGE ACCESS

03:35:07.227 --> 03:35:08.695
AS IT RELATES TO THEIR PROGRAMS

03:35:08.762 --> 03:35:10.397

THINGS SO WE CAN START WORKING

03:36:12.959 --> 03:36:15.996
ON ACCESS TO CLINICS. ACCESS TO-

03:36:16.063 --> 03:36:17.297
MORE DOCTORS IN THE MEDICAL

03:36:17.364 --> 03:36:18.832
SPACE WE HAVE NOW INCREASED

03:36:18.899 --> 03:36:20.967
ACCESS TO MEDICAL TO.

LEGISLATURE ON SOME AREAS WHERE

03:37:02.843 --> 03:37:03.910
THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE

03:37:03.977 --> 03:37:04.745
IMPROVEMENTS IN STATE OPERATIONS

03:44:53.613 --> 03:44:55.849
PRESENT A THREAT OR CONCERN FOR

03:44:55.915 --> 03:44:58.117
THE LIVES AND LIVELIHOODS OF THE

03:44:58.184 --> 03:45:01.621
TARGETED AUDIENCE- OUR AUDIENCES

03:45:01.688 --> 03:45:03.823
. F. FIFTH ONE IS CROSS AGENCY

03:45:03.890 --> 03:45:04.891
COORDINATION AND THIS IS

03:45:04.958 --> 03:45:06.226
CRITICAL BECAUSE IN PART OF

03:45:06.292 --> 03:45:08.962
WARRANTY- OPR IS AN APPROPRIATE

03:45:09.028 --> 03:45:11.164
PLACE- WE CONSTANTLY ENGAGE IN

03:45:11.231 --> 03:45:13.099
THAT PROCESS- AGENCY

03:45:13.166 --> 03:45:14.767
COORDINATION SO THIS WILL BE

03:45:14.834 --> 03:45:16.169
ISSUES THAT REQUIRE COORDINATION

03:45:16.236 --> 03:45:17.637
AND COLLABORATION ACROSS

03:45:17.704 --> 03:45:19.806
MULTIPLE AGENCIES. OR

03:45:19.873 --> 03:45:21.307
DEPARTMENTS I MENTIONED THAT

03:45:21.374 --> 03:45:22.742
STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL FOR

03:45:22.809 --> 03:45:24.477
EXAMPLE BETTER SEVEN AGENCIES

03:45:24.544 --> 03:45:27.347
THAT ARE REPRESENTED JUSTIN DOT

03:45:27.413 --> 03:45:29.148
BUCKET BUT THE OFFICE WORKS

03:45:29.215 --> 03:45:31.584
ACROSS MANY AGENCIES AND THEN

03:45:31.651 --> 03:45:34.420
LAST ONE EMERGING- MERCHANT

03:45:34.487 --> 03:45:36.623
MATTERS AND THEN- OUTCOMES

03:45:36.689 --> 03:45:37.957
ISSUES THAT HAVE CLEAR AND

03:45:38.024 --> 03:45:40.326
MEASURABLE GOALS. AND WE HAVE A

03:45:40.393 --> 03:45:41.928
SHORT TIME BUT ALSO THE KEY

03:45:41.995 --> 03:45:43.563
CRITERIA THAT WE HAVE IDENTIFIED

03:45:43.630 --> 03:45:45.098
BUT WE WILL DEFINITELY WORK WITH

03:45:45.164 --> 03:45:48.067
TH LEGISLATURE. AND THE

03:45:48.134 --> 03:45:50.403
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF THE PROGRAM

03:45:50.470 --> 03:45:53.206
DEVELOPS TO IDENTIFY. THE WAY-

03:45:53.273 --> 03:45:58.511
COMPANIES. GET SELECTED. THANK

03:45:58.578 --> 03:45:59.712
YOU FOR THE AS THIS IS AN

03:45:59.779 --> 03:46:00.780
INITIAL THAT PART OF THE

03:46:00.847 --> 03:46:02.315
GOVERNOR OFFICE VERSUS A STATE

03:46:02.382 --> 03:46:03.516
DEPARTMENT. THERE HAVE BEEN SOME

03:46:03.583 --> 03:46:05.685
FLOODING CONCERNS REGARDING THE

03:46:05.752 --> 03:46:08.221
CONTINUING OF THE PROGRAM BEYOND

03:46:08.288 --> 03:46:10.223
OUR CURRENT GOVERNOR'S TERM. HOW

03:46:10.290 --> 03:46:12.258
CAN YOU HELP HOW WOULD YOU

03:46:12.325 --> 03:46:13.259
RESPOND TO SOME OF THOSE

03:46:13.326 --> 03:46:17.096
CONCERNS. THE I'M SORRY FOR THE

03:46:17.163 --> 03:46:19.098
FACT THAT THIS IS THAT IN THE

03:46:19.165 --> 03:46:19.899
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. VERSUS THE

03:46:19.966 --> 03:46:24.904
DEPARTMENT. YES SO AGAIN THERE'S

03:46:24.971 --> 03:46:27.006
NO OTHER AGENCY THAT HAS THE

03:46:27.073 --> 03:46:30.543
SINGLE- THAT THAT- STRUCTURE

03:46:30.610 --> 03:46:33.012
THAT REALLY REACHES OUT TO ALL

03:46:33.079 --> 03:46:35.815
CROSS CUTTING ISSUES I THINK OPR

03:46:35.882 --> 03:46:38.451
BY STATUES ACTUALLY CREATED TO

03:46:38.518 --> 03:46:40.320
ADAPT AND TO ADVISE BOTH THE

03:46:40.386 --> 03:46:43.456
LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR AND

03:46:43.523 --> 03:46:45.358
NOT HAS BEEN HISTORICALLY THE

03:46:45.425 --> 03:46:46.826
WORK IT HAS BEEN DOING BUT I

03:46:46.893 --> 03:46:49.829
THINK THE CENTRAL ISSUE IS.

03:46:49.896 --> 03:46:51.464
THERE IS NO BETTER STRUCTURE

03:46:51.531 --> 03:46:54.500
WITHIN THIS ESTATE AGENCIES THAT

03:46:54.567 --> 03:46:57.403
HAS THE MOST- CROSSCUTTING

03:46:57.470 --> 03:47:00.039
ISSUES THAT OPR AS PART OF ITS

03:47:00.106 --> 03:47:03.042
START YOU UP TO THE- ENGAGES IN

03:47:03.109 --> 03:47:06.079
SO. THAT WE WOULD DEFINITELY- IT

03:47:06.145 --> 03:47:08.214
MAY BE NAMED BUT STRUCTURE AS

03:47:08.281 --> 03:47:10.183
THE OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR BUT

03:47:10.249 --> 03:47:13.152
IT IS PRETTY MUCH ALMOST- AT AN

03:47:13.219 --> 03:47:16.956
AGENCY THAT SURPRISING AND

03:47:17.023 --> 03:47:20.994
ADVISES- BOTH ARE BRANCHES. AND

03:47:21.060 --> 03:47:23.529
HOW IS THE SIXTY FIVE MILLION-

03:47:23.596 --> 03:47:26.432
DOLLAR AMOUNT CREATED WHERE DID

03:47:26.499 --> 03:47:29.535
THAT COME ABOUT. SO THOSE BASED

03:47:29.602 --> 03:47:31.671
ON THE LESSONS FONG A LOT THE

03:47:31.738 --> 03:47:35.475
LAST CENSUS AND CORBETT- THERE

03:47:35.541 --> 03:47:37.377
IS MUCH LARGER AMOUNTS

03:47:37.443 --> 03:47:40.279
IDENTIFIED THERE SO THE SIXTY

03:47:40.346 --> 03:47:43.249
FIVE WAS BASED ON THAT-

03:47:43.316 --> 03:47:45.284
EXPERIENCE AND A LOT OF THE- AND

03:47:45.351 --> 03:47:48.321
SO CURRENTLY IT'S DIVIDED INTO.

03:47:48.388 --> 03:47:49.422
POTENTIALLY FIFTY MILLION

03:47:49.489 --> 03:47:52.592
DOLLARS TO- FOR COMMUNITY BASED

03:47:52.658 --> 03:47:54.160
ORGANIZATIONS AND FIFTEEN

03:47:54.227 --> 03:47:57.397
MILLION FOR STATE OPERATIONS THE

03:47:57.463 --> 03:47:58.765
FIFTY MILLION IT I BELIEVE

03:47:58.831 --> 03:48:03.369
ALMOST HALF OF WHAT WAS- THAT-

03:48:03.436 --> 03:48:07.373
THAT SENSES OKAY WELL FROM THE

03:48:07.440 --> 03:48:09.442
PREVIOUS PROGRAM. I THINK I

03:48:09.509 --> 03:48:10.977
APPRECIATE THAT YOU HAVE BROUGHT

03:48:11.044 --> 03:48:13.646
UP- THE CENSUS QUITE A BIT IN IN

03:48:13.713 --> 03:48:16.883
THE CONVERSATION. SO MY DISTRICT

03:48:16.949 --> 03:48:18.184
IS ONE OF THE LOWEST COUNTED IN

03:48:18.251 --> 03:48:19.285
THE CENSUS AS I'VE MENTIONED A

03:48:19.352 --> 03:48:21.354
COUPLE OF TIMES NOW AND THIS

03:48:21.421 --> 03:48:23.456
BUDGET HEARING JUST BASED ON THE

03:48:23.523 --> 03:48:25.858
FACT THAT WE HAVE. EXPERIENCED

03:48:25.925 --> 03:48:27.860
CODED WELL WE'RE ALSO

03:48:27.927 --> 03:48:29.862
EXPERIENCING EXPERIENCED THE

03:48:29.929 --> 03:48:32.632
CENSUS COUNT AND SO WE KNOW THAT

03:48:32.698 --> 03:48:33.666
THE NUMBERS ARE MUCH LOWER

03:48:33.733 --> 03:48:35.535
ESPECIALLY IN UNINCORPORATED

03:48:35.601 --> 03:48:37.003
EAST LOS ANGELES AND ON THE EAST

03:48:37.070 --> 03:48:38.805
SIDE IN GENERAL. SURROUNDING

03:48:38.871 --> 03:48:40.506
COMMUNITIES INCLUDING SOUTH LOS

03:48:40.573 --> 03:48:43.142
ANGELES ALSO- EXPERIENCE THE

03:48:43.209 --> 03:48:45.678
SAME I WOULD I WOULD ENCOURAGE

03:48:45.745 --> 03:48:47.080
THAT MAYBE WE LOOK AT CENSUS

03:48:47.146 --> 03:48:49.182
TRACTS AND THE CONGRESSIONAL

03:48:49.248 --> 03:48:51.150
DISTRICTS THAT. WERE VASTLY

03:48:51.217 --> 03:48:53.052
MOVED AND SHIFTED BECAUSE OF

03:48:53.119 --> 03:48:55.054
CENSUS AND MY SIDE OF THE- THE

03:48:55.121 --> 03:48:56.589
CITY OF LOS ANGELES WE ACTUALLY

03:48:56.656 --> 03:48:58.324
LOST A HISTORIC SEAT AND I WAS

03:48:58.391 --> 03:49:00.193
THE SEAT OF. CONGRESSWOMAN

03:49:00.259 --> 03:49:03.029
LUCILLE ROYBAL ALLARD. BECAUSE

03:49:03.096 --> 03:49:05.798
OF THE LACK OF- BECAUSE OF THE

03:49:05.865 --> 03:49:08.201
LOWER NUMBER THRESHOLD- TO THE

03:49:08.267 --> 03:49:10.770
CENSUS SO. I WOULD HOPE THAT YOU

03:49:10.837 --> 03:49:13.406
START. IN AREAS LIKE FINE AND

03:49:13.473 --> 03:49:15.074
OTHERS ACROSS THE DISTRICT IN

03:49:15.141 --> 03:49:17.710
WHICH WE KNOW CENSUS NUMBERS ARE

03:49:17.777 --> 03:49:19.612
MUCH LOWER THAN WHAT WE KNOW

03:49:19.679 --> 03:49:20.313
ACTUALLY IS THE LIVED

03:49:20.379 --> 03:49:22.548
EXPERIENCE. OF THE PEOPLE IN OUR

03:49:22.615 --> 03:49:24.750
COMMUNITY. AND SO CAN I HOPE

03:49:24.817 --> 03:49:26.419
THAT'S HELPFUL AT LEAST IN SOME

03:49:26.486 --> 03:49:28.121
GUIDANCE. IN WHERE TO GET

03:49:28.187 --> 03:49:29.655
STARTED AND I KNOW I'M NOT THE

03:49:29.722 --> 03:49:31.591
ONLY ONE ACROSS THE STATE BUT-

03:49:31.657 --> 03:49:33.126
BECAUSE WE EXPERIENCED A

03:49:33.192 --> 03:49:34.927
SPECIFIC LOSS OF A MEMBER OF

03:49:34.994 --> 03:49:37.763
CONGRESS- AND THE EXPANSION OF

03:49:37.830 --> 03:49:38.898
CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS BECAUSE

03:49:38.965 --> 03:49:42.168
OF IT. I THINK IT WOULD BE

03:49:42.235 --> 03:49:43.169
IMPORTANT FOR THAT TO BE

03:49:43.236 --> 03:49:44.837
RECOGNIZED. YEAH I THINK IT'S SO

03:49:44.904 --> 03:49:46.172
THE CENTRAL PART OF THIS

03:49:46.239 --> 03:49:48.141
THINKING I THINK IS HOW DO WE

03:49:48.207 --> 03:49:49.809
SUPPORT THE CBO SAID LOCAL

03:49:49.876 --> 03:49:51.811
COMMUNITY SO WHEN I SAY FIFTY

03:49:51.878 --> 03:49:53.546
MILLION DOLLARS IS TO SUPPORT.

03:49:53.613 --> 03:49:56.349
THAT TO. CREATE LOCAL RESOURCES

03:49:56.415 --> 03:49:58.484
AND MAKE THAT PERMANENT IS NO

03:49:58.551 --> 03:50:00.052
ONE KNOWS THE LOCAL ISSUES

03:50:00.119 --> 03:50:01.487
BETTER BETTER BETTER THAN THE

03:50:01.554 --> 03:50:04.891
CBO. WE WANT TO FORMALIZE THAT.

03:50:04.957 --> 03:50:06.192
TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE QUESTIONS

03:50:06.259 --> 03:50:07.927
THAT YOU'RE RAISING OF THE UNDER

03:50:07.994 --> 03:50:10.596
COUNTY- ISSUES. THEY ARE MORE

03:50:10.663 --> 03:50:13.332
TRUSTED DONE OBVIOUSLY- OTHER

03:50:13.399 --> 03:50:15.968
CONSULTANTS OR GOVERNMENTS-

03:50:16.035 --> 03:50:17.470
OPERATIONS SO WE WANT TO BUILD

03:50:17.537 --> 03:50:20.840
ON THE TRUST. AND RESOURCE OF

03:50:20.907 --> 03:50:22.241
LOCAL COMMUNITY BASED

03:50:22.308 --> 03:50:24.343
ORGANIZATIONS THAT HELP AGAIN

03:50:24.410 --> 03:50:29.682
MORE THRUST AND WE'RE- HOPING IT

03:50:29.749 --> 03:50:30.650
OUT BUT WE BELIEVE. THAT WOULD

03:50:30.716 --> 03:50:32.485
HAVE MORE. AND OFF IN THE

03:50:32.552 --> 03:50:34.654
COMMENTS BUT I TAKE YOUR POINT

03:50:34.720 --> 03:50:37.823
THAT IS- AND SPECIALLY NOW WITH.

03:50:37.890 --> 03:50:40.226
REDISTRICTING IT IS AN ISSUE AND

03:50:40.293 --> 03:50:41.627
IN TERMS OF WHERE WE START WILL

03:50:41.694 --> 03:50:43.196
DEFINITELY WORK WITH THE

03:50:43.262 --> 03:50:46.799
LEGISLATURE TO- ONE THREE IN A-

03:50:46.866 --> 03:50:50.703
WORK ON THE DETAILS- OF. THE

03:50:50.770 --> 03:50:51.704
SELECTION PROCESS. AS THE

03:50:51.771 --> 03:50:53.372
COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS ON THE

03:50:53.439 --> 03:50:55.374
GROUND I APPRECIATE YOU SAY THAT

03:50:55.441 --> 03:50:57.210
SAYING THAT ARE ALSO INCREDIBLY

03:50:57.276 --> 03:50:59.545
OVERWORKED AND UNDERFUNDED. AND

03:50:59.612 --> 03:51:01.514
SO IT'S ADDING ON TO ADDITIONAL

03:51:01.581 --> 03:51:03.649
RESPONSIBILITIES AND PRESSURES

03:51:03.716 --> 03:51:05.718
AND SO IF WE ARE GOING TO DO

03:51:05.785 --> 03:51:06.652
THAT THEN WE SHOULD FIGURE OUT A

03:51:06.719 --> 03:51:08.721
WAY THAT WE ALSO FUND

03:51:08.788 --> 03:51:09.889
ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE GOOD

03:51:09.956 --> 03:51:12.225
PARTNERS. TO THE WORK THAT THE

03:51:12.291 --> 03:51:12.959
ADMINISTRATION IS HOPING TO DO

03:51:13.025 --> 03:51:15.261
IN AN EFFORT TO BE ABLE TO HELP

03:51:15.328 --> 03:51:17.263
AS MANY CALIFORNIANS AS POSSIBLE

03:51:17.330 --> 03:51:19.165
. YEAH AND THEN THE WHAT'S WAS

03:51:19.232 --> 03:51:21.267
REMARKABLE IN THE PREVIOUS A

03:51:21.334 --> 03:51:23.002
NUMBER OF CHALLENGING OF THE

03:51:23.069 --> 03:51:24.537
CENSUS WAS OR THE OUTREACH

03:51:24.604 --> 03:51:27.773
THROUGH CORBETT WAS- THE- STOCK

03:51:27.840 --> 03:51:28.908
THAT'D BE WORKING WITH THE

03:51:28.975 --> 03:51:30.776
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AS WELL AS A

03:51:30.843 --> 03:51:32.511
NUMBER OF AGENCIES. I BUILD A

03:51:32.578 --> 03:51:34.914
SIGNIFICANT DATABASE ABOUT FIVE

03:51:34.981 --> 03:51:37.617
CBO ORGANIZATIONS. SO WE DON'T

03:51:37.683 --> 03:51:39.785
WANT TO LOSE THAT AND COME BACK

03:51:39.852 --> 03:51:42.088
AND- YOU KNOW FIVE YEARS TO TEN

03:51:42.154 --> 03:51:44.624
YEARS LATER RATHER WE- RESOURCE

03:51:44.690 --> 03:51:46.659
GOALS AND WORK WITH THEM. TO HOW

03:51:46.726 --> 03:51:47.994
ABOUT CONTINUATION AND

03:51:48.060 --> 03:51:50.663
FORMALIZATION- I'VE SAID THIS

03:51:50.730 --> 03:51:53.633
BEFORE- PREVIOUSLY- OTHER STATES

03:51:53.699 --> 03:51:55.268
ARE LOOKING TO SOMETHING LIKE

03:51:55.334 --> 03:51:58.371
THAT AS WELL BECAUSE THERE'S A

03:51:58.437 --> 03:52:01.674
LOT OF FUN- WORKING FACT BE OF

03:52:01.741 --> 03:52:04.110
COLD AND IN SOME CASES BECAUSE

03:52:04.176 --> 03:52:05.878
OF A SENSE OF SELF I THINK THIS

03:52:05.945 --> 03:52:08.981
STATE AND THIS PROPOSAL IS I

03:52:09.048 --> 03:52:12.785

STATES THAT A LOT OF PLACES ARE

03:52:15.021 --> 03:52:16.522
LOOKING TO FORMALIZE THIS KIND

03:52:16.589 --> 03:52:18.391
OF ENGAGEMENT AND RESOURCE LOCAL

03:52:18.457 --> 03:52:22.328
PPO. FOR THIS PURPOSE HERE

IN THE CREATION OF THE TREE

03:52:29.802 --> 03:52:31.070
PROGRAM WHICH HELPED

COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS
