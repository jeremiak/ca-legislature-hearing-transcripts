03:16:00.915 --> 03:16:02.884
INCREASE TO THE COST PRESSURES

03:16:02.951 --> 03:16:04.752
ON THE FUND. FOR THE GOVERNOR'S

03:16:04.819 --> 03:16:06.988
PROPOSAL TO MOVE FROM SIX TO

03:16:07.055 --> 03:16:08.456
EIGHT WEEKS THAT'S CORRECT.

03:16:08.523 --> 03:16:09.858
AND IT IT ACTUALLY MEAN.

03:16:09.924 --> 03:16:12.060
IT THE IT'S NOT AN INCREASE IN

03:16:12.127 --> 03:16:13.628
THE RATE FROM YEAR TO YEAR UNDER

03:16:13.695 --> 03:16:15.497
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IT MEANS

03:16:15.563 --> 03:16:17.732
THE RATE WILL NOT GO DOWN IN

03:16:17.799 --> 03:16:18.933
NINETEEN TWENTY WHICH OTHERWISE

03:16:19.000 --> 03:16:21.202
WOULD HAVE OCCURRED ABSENT THE

03:16:21.269 --> 03:16:21.503
GOVERNOR'S.

03:16:21.569 --> 03:16:24.272
PROPOSAL. TO THE MAXIMUM RATE IS

03:16:24.339 --> 03:16:25.940
A ONE ONE HALF PERCENT CORRECT

03:16:26.007 --> 03:16:29.277
AND I I BELIEVE WE ARE AT ONE

03:16:29.344 --> 03:16:30.945
NOW AND WE WILL GO WE WOULD GO

03:16:31.012 --> 03:16:32.580
TO A ONE ONE ONE TWO UNDER THE

03:16:32.647 --> 03:16:34.716
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO GO FROM

03:16:34.782 --> 03:16:35.150
SIX TO EIGHT WEEKS.

03:16:35.216 --> 03:16:36.518
OKAY AND SO IT LOOKS AS WE WOULD

03:16:36.584 --> 03:16:38.186
WE WOULD STAY AT ONE VERSUS

03:16:38.253 --> 03:16:39.621
GOING TO POINT NINE I'M SORRY

03:16:39.687 --> 03:16:41.189
OKAY SO I MEAN TO PUT IT A

03:16:41.256 --> 03:16:41.923
DIFFERENT WHEN AND I WOULD

03:16:41.990 --> 03:16:43.458
IMAGINE THIS IS GONNA BE ABOUT

03:16:43.525 --> 03:16:45.026
50% MORE.

03:16:45.093 --> 03:16:45.894
IF WE GO FROM A WAY TO REPLACE

03:16:45.960 --> 03:16:50.131
RATE OF 60% 290%.

03:16:50.198 --> 03:16:52.133
ARE WELL YOUR YOUR INCREASING

03:16:52.200 --> 03:16:53.434
THE WAGE REPLACEMENT RATE WITH

03:16:53.501 --> 03:16:55.370
KERR UP BY ABOUT 50% THAT'S

03:16:55.436 --> 03:16:56.938
CORRECT I THINK IT WOULD DEPEND

03:16:57.005 --> 03:16:59.107
ON TAKE UP AND THE DISTRIBUTION

03:16:59.174 --> 03:17:01.576
OF TAKE UP AN INDIVIDUAL'S WAGES

03:17:01.643 --> 03:17:02.010
UNDER.

03:17:02.076 --> 03:17:03.144
OKAY WHAT LET ME TELL YOU MY

03:17:03.211 --> 03:17:05.013
CONCERN BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO

03:17:05.079 --> 03:17:07.081
PROLONG THE DISCUSSION BUT IF.

03:17:07.148 --> 03:17:09.150
IF IT'S WERE TALK ABOUT A POINT

03:17:09.217 --> 03:17:10.218
1%.

03:17:10.285 --> 03:17:11.653
ESSENTIALLY TAX ON ALL PAYROLL

03:17:11.719 --> 03:17:12.987
IN CALIFORNIA IS PLAYED BY THE

03:17:13.054 --> 03:17:14.556

THE AVERAGE PAY THE WAGES

03:17:16.324 --> 03:17:18.159
CALIFORNIA'S ABOUT SIXTY TWO

03:17:18.226 --> 03:17:18.860
THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR LAST

03:17:18.927 --> 03:17:21.362
YEAR SO ESSENTIALLY WE'RE TAKING

03:17:21.429 --> 03:17:22.063
IF WE ADOPT THIS TODAY WE'RE

03:17:22.130 --> 03:17:26.935

GET THAT RIGHT.

03:17:31.105 --> 03:17:32.574
I BELIEVE IF I WAS FALLING MATH

03:17:32.640 --> 03:17:34.075
CORRECTLY AYE AYE AYE TH I THINK

03:17:34.142 --> 03:17:35.243
THAT IS CORRECT OKAY WELL THAT

03:17:35.310 --> 03:17:36.578
THAT'S MY CONCERN I MEAN I THINK

03:17:36.644 --> 03:17:38.112
THE IN THE DISCUSSION WE'VE BEEN

03:17:38.179 --> 03:17:39.013
HAVING WE'RE PRETENDING THAT

03:17:39.080 --> 03:17:40.381
THIS HAS NO COSTS.

03:17:40.448 --> 03:17:41.816
BUT IT REALLY DOES EVERY

03:17:41.883 --> 03:17:42.917

FROM OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE IS

03:48:45.511 --> 03:48:48.047
NOT NOW NECESSARY. ONE IS

03:48:48.114 --> 03:48:50.817
CHANGED IN THE LAST WEEKS MONTHS

03:48:50.883 --> 03:48:51.918
THAT HAVE.

03:48:51.984 --> 03:48:54.320
ELIMINATED THE NEED TO FOR A

MAINTENANCE IS AT ALL TAKEN CARE

03:48:59.392 --> 03:49:00.426
OF BY ITSELF.

03:49:00.493 --> 03:49:02.195
ARE WE GETTING VOLUNTEERS TO DO

03:49:02.261 --> 03:49:03.362
THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE SORT OF

03:49:03.429 --> 03:49:04.997
BEING A LITTLE FACETIOUS HERE

03:49:05.064 --> 03:49:05.998
BUT THIS IS A PRETTY.

03:49:06.065 --> 03:49:07.900
SIGNIFICANT CUT IN DEFERRED

03:49:07.967 --> 03:49:09.368
MAINTENANCE AND WE HAVE BEEN

03:49:09.435 --> 03:49:11.270
TRYING STARTED WITH JEFF

03:49:11.337 --> 03:49:12.805
GOVERNOR BROWN TO GET CAUGHT UP.

03:49:12.872 --> 03:49:14.173
ON DEFERRED MAINTENANCE

03:49:14.240 --> 03:49:16.275
PERFECTLY IN THE SACRAMENTO AREA

03:49:16.342 --> 03:49:17.944
SO.

03:49:18.010 --> 03:49:18.711
WHITE WHY SO LATE.

03:49:18.778 --> 03:49:20.012
SO THE STATE'S DEFERRED

03:49:20.079 --> 03:49:21.280
MAINTENANCE NEEDS EXCEED IN

03:49:21.347 --> 03:49:23.116
ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION TWO

03:49:23.182 --> 03:49:23.749
HUNDRED NINE DOLLARS SO IN ANY

03:49:23.816 --> 03:49:25.151
GIVEN BUDGET THE QUESTION IS

03:49:25.218 --> 03:49:26.385
WHAT CAN WE DO GIVEN.

03:49:26.452 --> 03:49:27.553
THE OTHER PRIORITIES THAT WE

03:49:27.620 --> 03:49:29.188
HAVE IN THE BUDGET AND SO THIS

03:49:29.255 --> 03:49:30.723
BUDGET -- A HUNDRED MILLION

03:49:30.790 --> 03:49:32.125
DOLLARS STILL IS IN THE BUDGET

03:49:32.191 --> 03:49:33.526

ALLOCATIONS FOR UC AND CSU.

03:49:37.230 --> 03:49:38.831

03:49:38.898 --> 03:49:40.266
PRIORITIES THAT WE HAVE TO

03:49:40.333 --> 03:49:41.234

THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS

03:49:52.912 --> 03:49:54.213
THE ALLOCATION THAT WE HAD THEIR

03:49:54.280 --> 03:49:55.648
BACKS ALL THESE NINETEEN

03:49:55.715 --> 03:49:56.916

03:50:09.362 --> 03:50:10.630
PUT NINETEEN DEPARTMENTS THAT

03:50:10.696 --> 03:50:11.397
ARE BEING REDUCED THEY HAD MEANS

03:50:11.464 --> 03:50:12.398
THAT EXCEEDED THE INITIAL

03:50:12.465 --> 03:50:13.866
ALLOCATION THAT WE GAVE THEM SO --

03:50:13.933 --> 03:50:15.268
THAT THEY WILL JUST NOT GET AS

03:50:15.334 --> 03:50:16.569

BILLION DOLLARS SURPLUS.

03:50:41.060 --> 03:50:42.161
THAT MEANS THAT THAT HUNDRED

03:50:42.228 --> 03:50:44.463
MILLION WENT TO OTHER THINGS

03:50:44.530 --> 03:50:44.764
