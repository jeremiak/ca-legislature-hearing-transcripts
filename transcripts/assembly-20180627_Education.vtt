THESE MEASURES MOVING FORWARD AS

00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:51.174
WE DO BELIEVE THAT THEY WOULD

00:51:51.241 --> 00:51:53.477
HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS ON PROP

00:51:53.543 --> 00:51:54.077

00:52:09.493 --> 00:52:10.794
FISCAL YEAR BASIS.

00:52:10.861 --> 00:52:12.262
IT ALSO FEELS TO INCLUDE THE

00:52:12.329 --> 00:52:13.597
BASELINE SUPPLEMENT --

00:52:13.663 --> 00:52:15.765
SUB ACCOUNT INTO THE ACTUAL

00:52:15.832 --> 00:52:17.334
MAINTENANCE FACTOR ITSELF IT

00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:19.436
ALSO DOESN'T PROVIDE --

00:52:19.503 --> 00:52:20.770
FOR WHAT HAPPENS IN THE EVENT

00:52:20.837 --> 00:52:22.806
THAT THE IRS SAYS THAT --

00:52:22.873 --> 00:52:24.708
THEY ARE NOT GOING TO ACCEPTANCE

00:52:24.774 --> 00:52:27.010

00:52:33.850 --> 00:52:34.918
ADDITIONALLY IT DOESN'T

00:52:34.985 --> 00:52:36.052
CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED

00:52:36.119 --> 00:52:37.420

00:53:01.912 --> 00:53:04.347
WITH WHAT SOME CALLED A TAX CUT.

00:53:04.414 --> 00:53:05.482
RICE THAT'S VERY UNFORTUNATE IN

00:53:05.549 --> 00:53:07.250

WHAT THEIR OFFERINGS ARE SO IF

01:17:17.265 --> 01:17:18.367
YOU LIVE WITHIN A DISTRICT MIGHT

01:17:18.433 --> 01:17:20.035

ISSUE IN FUTURE YEARS OUT WE

01:17:34.149 --> 01:17:35.417
SHOULD.

01:17:35.484 --> 01:17:36.718
THINK HARD ABOUT WHAT THE RIGHT

01:17:36.785 --> 01:17:37.519

01:17:55.170 --> 01:17:56.271
YOUR COMMENTS A MISTER VICE

I U. S. --

01:17:59.875 --> 01:18:02.110
YOU YOU YOU YOU OBSERVE THAT YOU

01:18:02.177 --> 01:18:03.645
KNOW MAYBE SOME DISTRICTS DON'T

01:18:03.712 --> 01:18:04.479
HAVE.

01:18:04.546 --> 01:18:06.348
A DIFFERENT ART PROGRAMS AT SOME

01:18:06.415 --> 01:18:07.149
OTHER SCHOOLS I CAN TELL YOU

01:18:07.215 --> 01:18:08.717
THAT I'M LONG BEACH WE DO WE

01:18:08.784 --> 01:18:10.552
HAVE A MEDIA ARTS SCHOOL --

01:18:10.619 --> 01:18:11.953
IT'S VERY COMPUTER BASED AND

01:18:12.020 --> 01:18:13.922
THEN WE HAVE OF THE RENAISSANCE

01:18:13.989 --> 01:18:15.390
HIGH SCHOOL WHICH IS MORE.

01:18:15.457 --> 01:18:17.159
THE I GUESS VISUAL ARTS SPACE SO

01:18:17.225 --> 01:18:18.226
THERE ARE DISTRICTS THAT ARE

01:18:18.293 --> 01:18:20.062
DEVELOPING THESE PROGRAMS ACROSS

01:18:20.128 --> 01:18:20.729
THE STATE I DON'T THINK WE WANT

01:18:20.796 --> 01:18:21.730
TO MANDATE.

01:18:21.797 --> 01:18:23.031
THAT TO OCCUR FROM SACRAMENTO IS

01:18:23.098 --> 01:18:25.000
WE DON'T KNOW THE NEEDS OF EVERY

01:18:25.067 --> 01:18:26.902
LOCAL DISTRICT AND TO YOUR POINT

01:18:26.968 --> 01:18:28.370
ABOUT CREATING ANOTHER CANNIBAL

01:18:28.437 --> 01:18:29.438
CORPORAL PROGRAM I DON'T THINK

01:18:29.504 --> 01:18:30.705
THIS DOES THAT I THINK WHAT THIS

01:18:30.772 --> 01:18:33.075
DOES IS IT INCENTIVIZE BEHAVIOR.

01:18:33.141 --> 01:18:34.643
AND WHAT I FOUND --

01:18:34.709 --> 01:18:36.745
DURING MY TIME IN SACRAMENTO IS

01:18:36.812 --> 01:18:37.279
BETTER THAT WE INCENTIVIZE

01:18:37.345 --> 01:18:38.480
BEHAVIOR.

01:18:38.547 --> 01:18:39.881
THEN WE MANDATE BEHAVIORS AND

01:18:39.948 --> 01:18:43.885
YOU GET MORE SIDE WHEN YOU WHEN

01:18:43.952 --> 01:18:45.420
YOU INCENTIVIZE IT'S DIFFERENT

01:18:45.487 --> 01:18:46.688
TYPES OF BEHAVIOR AND AGAIN I

01:18:46.755 --> 01:18:47.956
THINK THE INTENT HERE IS TO

01:18:48.023 --> 01:18:49.825
CREATE THAT CAPACITY.

01:18:49.891 --> 01:18:51.293
AT THE DISTRICT AND SCHOOL SITE

01:18:51.359 --> 01:18:52.928

01:18:56.198 --> 01:18:56.965
IT CAPACITY IN THE

01:18:57.032 --> 01:18:58.266
INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:18:58.333 --> 01:19:00.001
