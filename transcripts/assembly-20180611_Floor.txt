JUNETEENTH PROVIDES US WITH A POWERFUL AND SOBERING MESSAGE OF ENDURANCE AND STRENGTH IN THE FACE OF ADVERSITY. FREEDOM WAS TOO LONG IN COMING FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS IN THE UNITED STATES AND WE MUST NEVER FORGET THE STRUGGLE OF LIBERTY AND JUSTICE THAT MADE FINAL EMANCIPATION POSSIBLE. WE KNOW THAT THE CONSEQUENCES OF SLAVERY STILL ECHO TO THIS DAY I WITH AS WE STILL SEE PEOPLE. THAT ARE BEING RIPPED APART FROM THEIR FAMILIES. AS A MEANS OF CONTROL AND DISCRIMINATION. THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT A WE COMMEMORATE THIS DAY AND EMPHASIZE THE DIGNITY AND ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY. UNLIKE A CERTAIN HIP HOP ARTISTS WHO CLAIM RECENTLY THAT SLAVERY WAS A CHOICE WE KNOW BETTER. WE KNOW. THAT THE CHAINS OF OPPRESSION AND MARGINALIZATION WERE LITERAL SHACKLES THAT BOUND TO PEOPLE INTO CENTURIES. A POVERTY. IT IS ONLY THROUGH THE LIBERATION OF ALL PEOPLE. BILL WE CAN ALL TRULY BE FREE. I THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM PASADENA FOR BRINGING THIS RESOLUTION. TO THE FLOOR AND I URGE YOU AYE VOTE FOR HR ONE OF SIX THANK YOU. MAKING HIS GRIMACE LEVINE YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. pSPEAKER AND MEMBERS I ALSO RISE IN SUPPORT ON BEHALF OF THE JEWISH CAUCUS FOR HR ONE OF SIX IMPORTANT. TO MARK JUNETEENTH AND HOW IMPORTANT THIS WAS I BET THAT THE EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION AND THEN THE FISCAL AUTHORITY TO ACTUALLY FREE. SLAVES WAS FOR ALL AMERICANS AND OF COURSE FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS BUT IT IS ALSO. IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT FORMER SLAVES THAT DAY. WE'RE NOT. DELIVERED INTO FREEDOM. AND LIBERATION THEY WERE USHERED INTO AN ERA OF THE BLACK COATS AND THE JIM CROW SOUTH. AND IF YOU THINK THAT'S BEHIND US. OPEN YOUR EYES WE HAVE A WHOLE LOT MORE TO DO. AND SPUR SOME IT'S AS THOUGH LINCOLN'SPROCLAMATION STILL HAS YET TO ARRIVE I URGE ALL AND I THE ONLY TRUE IN A SIX. THINGS SURE LEVINE DOCTOR WEBER. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I RISE IS A MEMBER OF THE CAUCUS AT THANK ONCE AGAIN. OUR OUR LEADER OF MISTER HOLDEN FROM PASADENA IN BRINGING THIS RESOLUTION FOR. YOU A JUNETEENTH IS AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT DAY WAS HISTORICALLY IN THE LIFE OF AFRICAN AMERICANS. BECAUSE IT ENDED FOR AT LEAST LEGALLY. SLAVERY IN THIS COUNTRY. BUT AS POINTED OUT IT ISSUED IN A NEW ERA. IN THAT ERA CONTINUES TO THIS DAY IN DIFFERENT FORMS. AND DIFFERENT METHODS AND DIFFERENT OPPORTUNITY ACT OF OPPORTUNITY FOR SO MANY. BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT ALSO TO RECOGNIZE THAT EVEN THOUGH. IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY FIVE WHEN EMANCIPATION CAME AND WAS TOLD TO THE LAST WEEK WITH PEOPLE AND TEXAS THAT THEY HAD BEEN FREED LEGALLY FREE. THE RESIDUAL IMPACT OF THAT IS STILL FELT. AND I THINK LAST YEAR A TALK TO YOU ABOUT A A WALLET THAT I SAW WHEN I WAS AT THE MUSEUM. AND HOW PRECIOUS FREEDOM WAS BECAUSE IT WAS SO FRAGILE TO THOSE WHO ARE WHO ARE IN SLAVE AND THOSE WHO WOULD NOT ENSLAVED. BUT IT ALSO HAS AN IMPACT ON PEOPLE'S LIVES TODAY. HOW'S THAT A BOOK CLUB YESTERDAY AND WE WERE READING A BOOK CALLED HOMECOMING BY THE AFRICAN AUTHOR. AND ONE OF THE THINGS OF THE FAME OF ONE OF THOSE BOOKS WAS THE ISSUE OF BELONGING. AND UNDERSTANDING WHO YOU ARE. AND I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM FROM THE ASSEMBLY DISTRICT ONE. AND THE MEMBERS OF HIS OF HIS STAFF. FOR HELPING US TO GET A LITTLE BIT CLOSER TO UNDERSTANDING THE IMPACT OF THAT SLAVERY HAS HAD ON OUR LIVES. YOU KNOW MOST OF YOU CAN BEGIN TO TALK ABOUT YOUR FAMILY. A YOU CAN TALK ABOUT HOW FAR YOU CAN GO BACK AND YOU CAN REMEMBER YOUR RELATIVES AND YOU HAVE PHOTOGRAPHS WE HAVE PICTURES AND YOU HAVE. ALL OF THIS STUFF THAT HELPS YOU TO DEFINE WHO YOU ARE AS A PERSON. IF YOU'RE AN AFRICAN AMERICAN. YOU'LL BE LUCKY TO KNOW YOUR GREAT GRANDFATHER. IF YOU'RE MY AGE. OTHERS MAY KNOW THEIR GREAT GREAT IF THEY'RE YOUNGER. BUT THE ABSENCE OR THE ERASING OF HISTORY AND HERITAGE. IS SO PROFOUND. THAT IT BECOMES DIFFICULT TO HAVE A SENSE OF BELONGING. A SENSE OF IDENTITY. AND KNOWING WHO YOU ARE. YOU CAN ONLY IMAGINE IT'S ALMOST AS IF YOU WERE AN ORPHAN. YOU CAN ONLY IMAGINE HOW FAR YOU CAN GO BACK AND UNDERSTANDING. BECAUSE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF AMERICAN SLAVERY WAS AN ATTEMPT TO COMPLETELY ERASE. PASSED THE THE HISTORY THE GREATNESS OF AFRICANS IN THIS COUNTRY. SO THAT THEIR FAMILIES WERE SEPARATED AND DIVIDED NEVER TO BE FOUND AGAIN. AND ONE OF THE GREATEST THINGS THAT HAPPENED AT THE END OF EMANCIPATE OF OF SLAVERY WAS A PEOPLE BEGAN TO LOOK FOR FAMILY. AND THAT NUMBER PLAYS ABOUT PEOPLE LOOKING FOR FAMILIES JOE TURNER'S COME AND GONE IS ONE OF THOSE BUT AUGUST WILSON. AND IN THAT THERE'S ALWAYS THIS SERVES TO TRY TO FIND WHO YOU'RE PEOPLE WORK. BECAUSE YOU WERE SEPARATED. YOU MIGHT KNOW BROTHER SISTER IF THEY HAPPEN TO REMAIN AT THE SAME PLANTATION. BUT THE LIKELIHOOD OF ACTUALLY TRACING YOUR FAMILY BACK IT'S DIFFICULT. AND IT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN TO THOSE WHO HAVE ALL OF THAT IN THEIR PAST. JUST HOW ABSENCE IT FEEL IN YOUR HEART BUT YOU DON'T KNOW THAT. I WAS FORTUNATE TO CHEER TO BASICALLY GET SOME OF THAT INFORMATION NOT ALL OF IT. BUT I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW IT FELT TO FOR WANT TO SEE MY GREAT GRANDFATHER SPACE. BUT I HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE. AND TO SEE A NAME ON A SINCE HIS RECORD. OF A GREAT GRANDFATHER. AND HAVE SOME SINCE OF TRYING TO PIECE THOSE PIECES TOGETHER BUT I HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO PIECE TOGETHER. I HOPE WE UNDERSTAND WHY I TALK THE WAY I TALK. WHY HAD THE PASSION THAT I HAVE I KNOW IT COMES FROM MY PARENTS BUT I ALSO WONDER DID IT COME FROM SOME OF THEM? THAT I GET SOME OF THIS PASSION AND SOME OF THIS ELOQUENCE YOU GUYS SAY I HAVE FROM SOME OF THEM. I DON'T KNOW. AND SO IT'S THE LOS PIECES THAT ARE IN OUR LIVES THAT SLAVERY HAS TAKEN AWAY. THAT WILL NEVER BE REPLACED. AND SO I JUST WANTED TO SHARE THAT WITH YOU BECAUSE WE OFTEN TALK ABOUT THE CELEBRATION AND THE ENDING OF SLAVERY AND THE MOVING FORWARD AND THE CHALLENGES OF JIM CROW. BUT THIS OTHER PIECE THAT MAKES US HUMAN. IS THERE. I CAN REMEMBER WHEN OF. ONE OF THE AUTHOR HAD WRITTEN A BOOK AND HE WENT TO THE FREEDOM OF OF EGGMAN GHANA AND HE SAT THERE AND HE WATCHED PEOPLE. WHEN GOT I GOT ITS LIBERATION IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES. HE SAID HE'S SADDAM LEBRON BENNETT WAS THE AUTHOR HE SAW THEM CRYING FOR THEIR FREEDOM AND LOVE FOR THEIR COUNTRY. AND HE SAID HE SAT THERE CRYING FOR HIMSELF. BECAUSE HE DIDN'T HAVE THAT DEEP HISTORY. AND THAT DEEP LOVE FOR AMERICA. BECAUSE IT WAS SUCH A SHORT HISTORY. AND HE DIDN'T HAVE ALL OF THE PIECES THAT MADE HIM AN AMERICAN. IT'S I WANTED TO SHARE THAT SO YOU UNDERSTAND WHO WE ARE. UNDERSTAND THE ANGST BUT MORE IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND THE DEVASTATING IMPACT OF SLAVERY. AND THAT AS WE CAST THEM THINK ABOUT IT WE SAY TO OURSELVES NEVER AGAIN. BECAUSE OF THE LONG TERM PERMANENT IMPACT IT HAS ON THE LIFE OF PEOPLE WHEN YOU DEHUMANIZE THEM AND YOU TAKE THEIR HUMANITY. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR HR ONE ALL SIX. THANK YOU DOCTOR WEBER. SEEING NO ADDITIONAL COMMENT. ON THE RESOLUTION MISTER HOLDING YOU MAY CLOSE WE WISH. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND LET ME JUST THINK ARE MY COLLEAGUES WHO HAVE. RISEN TO SHARE WORDS OF ELOQUENCE. AND A REFLECTION OF WHAT THIS DAY MEANS. A NOT JUST WHAT IT MEANS TO AFRICAN AMERICAN. COMMUNITY BUT WHAT IT MEANS TO ALL OF US. BECAUSE WE'RE INFLUENCE AND IMPACTED BY HISTORY WHETHER IT FELT. SPECIFICALLY ON OUR PARTICULAR COMMUNITY BUT IT HAD RIPPLES ACROSS ALL OF OUR. COMMUNITIES. SO WE'RE ONE AMERICA SO WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THE HISTORY AND THE IMPACTS GOOD BAD AND INDIFFERENT THAT IT HAS HAD ON ALL OF OUR CAN. SO THIS IS THE DAY FOR THEY OFTEN AMERICAN COMMUNITY TO REJOICE IN THE FACT THAT THERE WAS AN INTO SLAVERY. YES THERE WERE OTHER CHALLENGES THAT CAME AFTERWARDS. WE PERSEVERE. TODAY. WE COLLABORATE. WE COME TOGETHER ON THIS FLOOR. DEBATE ISSUES THAT IMPACT ON ALL OF US. SO WE ARE JUST PLEASED TODAY THAT WE CAN LOOK BACK FOR A MOMENT TO REFLECT ON. WHAT HAS HAPPENED SO THAT WE CAN LEARN NOT JUST? ABOUT THE HISTORY OF THE PAST. BUT THAT IT CAN ALSO. PARIS TO HOW TO MOVE FORWARD IN YOUR FUTURE MISTER SPEAKER I ASK FOR THE FIRST RULE OF THE OPEN FOR COLLECTORS.
