00:28:44.589 --> 00:28:48.226
HELPFUL IT PROVIDES SOME

00:28:48.293 --> 00:28:48.760

AND- I WANTED TO CALL YOUR

00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:54.933
ATTENTION TO THIS TABLE BECAUSE

00:28:54.999 --> 00:28:56.468
IT HIGHLIGHTS SOME OF THE KEY

00:28:56.534 --> 00:28:57.802
DIFFERENCES- BETWEEN THE IBEACON

00:28:57.869 --> 00:28:59.838
CPSC PROGRAMS THAT- BURKE WERE

00:28:59.904 --> 00:29:02.140
DISCUSSED AND IF YOU LOOK IN THE

00:29:02.207 --> 00:29:04.409
MIDDLE- COLUMN ON TOTALLY

00:29:04.476 --> 00:29:06.144
FINANCING FRIENDS I'M SORRY THE

INVESTMENTS AND THEN THE AVERAGE-AMOUNT YOU'LL SEE THAT THE

00:29:09.914 --> 00:29:11.649
CAPITAL ACCESS PROGRAM SUPPORTED

00:29:11.716 --> 00:29:14.119
A- RELATIVELY LARGE NUMBER OF

00:29:14.185 --> 00:29:15.553
LOANS. THAT WERE ALSO

00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:18.756
RELATIVELY- SMALL DOLLAR AMOUNTS

00:29:18.823 --> 00:29:22.093
AND- THE LOAN GUARANTEE PROGRAM-

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:23.928
FOR EXAMPLE- BUT LISTEN TO SOME

00:29:23.995 --> 00:29:25.363
OF YOUR LOANS BUT MUCH LARGER

00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:26.965
DOLLAR VALUE SO I THINK THAT'S

00:29:27.031 --> 00:29:29.167
IMPORTANT- IN CONTEXT AND- WHAT

00:29:29.234 --> 00:29:30.502
WAS JUST DISCUSSED AND ALSO

00:29:30.568 --> 00:29:31.870
THINKING ABOUT. ON THE PROGRAM

00:29:31.936 --> 00:29:36.508
MOVING FORWARD- AND WE CAN TALK

00:29:36.574 --> 00:29:37.475
ABOUT MORE OF THIS IF YOU WANTED

00:29:37.542 --> 00:29:40.011

ATTORNEY. NINE DESCRIBE SECOND

00:29:42.046 --> 00:29:44.015
ITERATION OF THE SST SAGT AND

00:29:44.082 --> 00:29:45.216
I'M NOT GOING TO DWELL ON THIS

00:29:45.283 --> 00:29:46.284
BECAUSE THE PREVIOUS PANELISTS

00:29:46.351 --> 00:29:48.586
DESCRIBED IT VERY WELL. I DID

00:29:48.653 --> 00:29:49.387
WANT TO CALL YOUR ATTENTION TO

00:29:49.454 --> 00:29:51.489
THE THREE VOTES FOR BOTTOM OF

00:29:51.556 --> 00:29:52.724
PAGE NINE SO ON THESE ARE THE

00:29:52.790 --> 00:29:54.425
PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS THE MISTER

00:29:54.492 --> 00:29:57.195
KELLAN I JUST DESCRIBED. AND IT.

00:29:57.262 --> 00:29:58.463
IS MIGHT HAVE BEEN CLEAR FROM

00:29:58.530 --> 00:30:00.431
THAT BUT- WE WANT TO CALL

00:30:00.498 --> 00:30:01.399
ATTENTION TO IT TO SOME EXTENT

00:30:01.466 --> 00:30:03.668
THE VARIOUS REQUIREMENTS OF THE

00:30:03.735 --> 00:30:05.270
FEDERAL- PROGRAM. WORK AT CROSS

00:30:05.336 --> 00:30:06.938
PURPOSES- AND THE PROGRAMS WILL

00:30:07.005 --> 00:30:07.772
NEED TO BALANCE THESE

00:30:07.839 --> 00:30:09.941
REQUIREMENTS IN ORDER FOR THE

00:30:10.008 --> 00:30:11.509
PROGRAMS TO ACHIEVE ALL OF THEIR

00:30:11.576 --> 00:30:13.178
OBJECTIVES. AND IN THE LAST

00:30:13.244 --> 00:30:14.412
COUPLE DAYS AND ALSO REPRINTED

00:30:14.479 --> 00:30:16.447
IN THE AGENDA ARE SOME OF OUR-

00:30:16.514 --> 00:30:18.449
KEY TAKE AWAYS BUT THE MAIN

00:30:18.516 --> 00:30:19.517
OVERARCHING POINT IS THAT THE

00:30:19.584 --> 00:30:21.920
STATE. WILL NEED TO INCREASE ITS

00:30:21.986 --> 00:30:22.787
CAPACITY FOR THESE LENDING

00:30:22.854 --> 00:30:23.688
SUPPORT PROGRAMS ON PRETTY

00:30:23.755 --> 00:30:25.890
QUICKLY. AND THAT THIS WILL

00:30:25.957 --> 00:30:27.258
LIKELY REQUIRE THE STATE TO TAKE

00:30:27.325 --> 00:30:30.094
ON A LITTLE BIT MORE RISK. OTHER

00:30:30.161 --> 00:30:31.162
PROGRAMS WILL NEED TO

00:30:31.229 --> 00:30:32.197
SIMULTANEOUSLY GIVE ATTENTION

00:30:32.263 --> 00:30:33.464
BOTH TO PROGRAMS THAT HELP THE

00:30:33.531 --> 00:30:35.500
SMALLEST BORROWERS AS WELL AS

00:30:35.567 --> 00:30:42.006
THOSE THAT HELP SMALL BUSINESSES. AT THE LARGER END OF THE

00:30:42.073 --> 00:30:43.074
SPECTRUM. AND THEN- REALLY TO.

00:30:43.141 --> 00:30:44.876
OF IS- WE SUGGEST YOU LOOK

00:30:44.943 --> 00:30:46.544
FORWARD AHEAD TO TWENTY THIRTY.

00:30:46.611 --> 00:30:47.845
AND BEGIN THINKING ABOUT HOW THE

00:30:47.912 --> 00:30:49.681
FUNDS THAT- ARE MADE AVAILABLE

00:30:49.747 --> 00:30:51.883
FOLLOWING THE REPAYMENT OF LOANS

00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:54.586
ARE REDEPLOYED. AND RECYCLED IN

00:30:54.652 --> 00:30:57.322
THESE PROGRAMS. TO THIS END YOU

00:30:57.388 --> 00:30:58.456
WILL LIKELY WANT TO ENSURE THE

00:30:58.523 --> 00:30:59.857
PROGRAMS ARE TRANSPARENT THEY

00:30:59.924 --> 00:31:01.326
KEEP GOOD RECORDS AND AVOID

00:31:01.392 --> 00:31:02.527
INTERMINGLING STATE AND FEDERAL

00:31:02.594 --> 00:31:04.963
FUNDS FOR EXAMPLE. MOREOVER

00:31:05.029 --> 00:31:07.332
WHILE THE PROGRAMS ARE TO SOME

00:31:07.398 --> 00:31:09.767
EXTENT. SELF SUSTAINING TWO

00:31:09.834 --> 00:31:11.002
THREE OTHER FEES AND INTEREST

00:31:11.069 --> 00:31:13.037
PAYMENTS AND SO FORTH- THEY DO

00:31:13.104 --> 00:31:15.306
TYPICALLY- OVER THE LONG RUN

00:31:15.373 --> 00:31:17.475
REQUIRE SOME- MAY REQUIRE SOME

00:31:17.542 --> 00:31:18.977
GENERAL FUND SUPPORT SO YOU'LL

00:31:19.043 --> 00:31:20.912
WANT TO CONSIDER WITH THE

00:31:20.979 --> 00:31:21.512
APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF ON GOING

00:31:21.579 --> 00:31:22.714
SUPPORT WOULD BE FOR THESE

00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:24.549
PROGRAMS- THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED

00:31:24.616 --> 00:31:25.650
FOR THEM TO CONTINUE AT A

00:31:25.717 --> 00:31:26.551
CERTAIN LEVEL. AND SO THIS

00:31:26.618 --> 00:31:27.619
CONCLUDES OUR INITIAL COMMENTS

00:31:27.685 --> 00:31:30.088
BUT WE CAN DIG INTO ANY SPECIFIC

00:31:30.154 --> 00:31:31.256
ASPECTS- MORE DEEPLY DEPENDING

00:31:31.322 --> 00:31:33.891
ON YOUR LEVEL OF INTEREST. OKAY

00:31:33.958 --> 00:31:36.094
THANK YOU FOR THAT- WE DON'T

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:37.862
HAVE AYONE ELSE CUED UP WE'RE

00:31:37.929 --> 00:31:40.164
GOING TO BRING IT BACK TO

00:31:40.231 --> 00:31:41.199
COMMITTEE SENATOR ROB DO YOU

00:31:41.266 --> 00:31:44.369
HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. SENATOR ROTH

00:31:44.435 --> 00:31:46.471
SAID NOW YOU KNOW WELL MISTER

00:31:46.537 --> 00:31:48.740
WEATHERFORD YOU- SORT OF

00:31:48.806 --> 00:31:50.675
SUGGESTED I LOVE IT YOU SAID

00:31:50.742 --> 00:31:51.576
WHAT WE MIGHT NOT HAVE THE

00:31:51.643 --> 00:31:53.745
CAPACITY. THE STATE WILL NEED TO

00:31:53.811 --> 00:31:55.179
INCREASE THE CAPACITY AND HERE I

00:31:55.246 --> 00:31:57.148
WAS THINKING WHERE DO WE GET TO

00:31:57.215 --> 00:31:59.117
THE PLACE WHERE WE CAN OFFER

00:31:59.183 --> 00:32:01.686
ZERO. 3% INTEREST LOANS. TO

00:32:01.753 --> 00:32:04.589
SMALL BUSINESSES- THAT NEED THIS

00:32:04.656 --> 00:32:06.024
KIND OF HELP GIVEN THAT THERE

00:32:06.090 --> 00:32:08.026
ARE NUMBER OF ORGANIZATIONS THAT

00:32:08.092 --> 00:32:09.761
ARE ALSO DOING THIS KIND OF WORK

00:32:09.827 --> 00:32:11.462
ON A MUCH SMALLER SCALE THAT

00:32:11.529 --> 00:32:14.932
HAVE VERY HIGH REPAYMENT- RATIOS

00:32:14.999 --> 00:32:17.769
AND SO BUT THAT JUST. MIGHT BE

00:32:17.835 --> 00:32:19.370
MY SOCIALIST SELF COMING. YOU

00:32:19.437 --> 00:32:21.673
KNOW IF I IF I IF I CAN I THINK

00:32:21.739 --> 00:32:23.141
ABOUT IT HIGHLIGHTS- THESE THESE

00:32:23.207 --> 00:32:25.877
THIS BALANCING THAT THE AND YOU

00:32:25.943 --> 00:32:27.278
KNOW THE TREASURER'S OFFICE I

00:32:27.345 --> 00:32:28.579
THINK MIGHT BE A PROVIDES MORE.

00:32:28.646 --> 00:32:29.781
DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT THIS

00:32:29.847 --> 00:32:31.115
BUT THE HIGHLIGHTS THAT THE

00:32:31.182 --> 00:32:32.884
TRUTH THE CHALLENGES THAT THE

00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:34.085
REQUIREMENTS IMPOSED BECAUSE

00:32:34.152 --> 00:32:35.386
THERE'S THE LEVERAGE. PROVIDING

00:32:35.453 --> 00:32:38.890
A 0% INTEREST RATE WOULD- MAYBE

00:32:38.956 --> 00:32:40.525
NOT GET THE- THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF

00:32:40.591 --> 00:32:42.593
LEVERAGE RATIO OR MIGHT- REQUIRE

00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:43.928
THE STATE TO TAKE ON MORE RISK

00:32:43.995 --> 00:32:45.496
TO MEET HISTORICALLY- BEEN

00:32:45.563 --> 00:32:46.998
COMFORTABLE TAKING ON SO IT'S

00:32:47.065 --> 00:32:48.666
ABOUT BALANCING THESE COMPETING

00:32:48.733 --> 00:32:50.535
OBJECTIVES. NO I DON'T KNOW IF

00:32:50.601 --> 00:32:52.470
ANYONE ELSE WANTS TO COMMENT ON

00:32:52.537 --> 00:32:54.205
THAT QUESTION MISTER CALLUM YEAH

00:32:54.272 --> 00:32:56.541
YEAH- I THINK ONE THING TO POINT

00:32:56.607 --> 00:32:58.743
OUT TO YOU IS THAT THESE ARE

00:32:58.810 --> 00:32:59.744
CREDIT SUPPORT PROGRAMS. SO

00:32:59.811 --> 00:33:01.112
THEY'RE SUPPORTING BANKS BEING

00:33:01.179 --> 00:33:03.514
ABLE TO PROVIDE CAPITAL THEY'RE

00:33:03.581 --> 00:33:05.383
NOT ABLE TO BE DIRECT GRANTS TO

00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:07.485
BANKS AND SO THERE STILL HAS TO

00:33:07.552 --> 00:33:08.953
BE A FINANCIAL INTEREST IN THE

00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:11.089
BANK MAKING LOAN- AND WHERE

00:33:11.155 --> 00:33:13.291
WE'RE TRYING TO. MITIGATE RISK-

00:33:13.358 --> 00:33:15.293
AND IN THAT MITIGATION AND

00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:16.728
THEY'LL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE

00:33:16.794 --> 00:33:18.629
CAPITAL THEY MAY LOWER THAT

00:33:18.696 --> 00:33:19.464
INTEREST RATE- BUT GIVEN THAT

00:33:19.530 --> 00:33:21.332
THEY ARE. YOU KNOW THEY OPERATE

00:33:21.399 --> 00:33:24.268
ON- A MARGIN THEY HAVE TO CHARGE

00:33:24.335 --> 00:33:25.737
SOME INTEREST AND SO OUR

00:33:25.803 --> 00:33:27.739
PROGRAMS ARE CERTAINLY AIMED AT

00:33:27.805 --> 00:33:30.341
TRYING TO LOWER THOSE. COSTS BUT

00:33:30.408 --> 00:33:32.343
I ELIMINATING THEM ALL TOGETHER-

00:33:32.410 --> 00:33:34.212
ISN'T REALLY AS A POSSIBILITY

00:33:34.278 --> 00:33:35.980
WITH THIS PROGRAM. ALL RIGHT

00:33:36.047 --> 00:33:38.616
MOVING BACK TO CAPITALISM. I'M

00:33:38.683 --> 00:33:41.452
I. HAD A QUESTION THE- MISS

00:33:41.519 --> 00:33:43.755
SERIN TALKED ABOUT. YOU'RE

00:33:43.821 --> 00:33:45.289
WORKING WITH A LENDER COMMUNITY

00:33:45.356 --> 00:33:47.225
AND ALSO OBVIOUSLY HOPING TO

00:33:47.291 --> 00:33:50.128
EXPAND. THAT NETWORK- YOU KNOW

00:33:50.194 --> 00:33:54.198
GIVEN WHAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE-

00:33:54.265 --> 00:33:55.900
IN FRONT OF US. HAVE GIVEN ANY

00:33:55.967 --> 00:33:58.369
THOUGHT TO. SPECIFICALLY WHAT

00:33:58.436 --> 00:34:00.104
THAT KIND OF ALTERNATIVE OR

00:34:00.171 --> 00:34:02.140
EXPANDED OUTREACH WOULD LOOK

00:34:02.206 --> 00:34:04.409
LIKE I MEAN I ALWAYS AM ASKING

00:34:04.475 --> 00:34:07.678
FOLKS TO CONSIDER- GROUPS THAT

00:34:07.745 --> 00:34:09.213
YOU HAVEN'T NORMALLY WORKED WITH

00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:10.982
IN THE PAST BECAUSE THEY CAN

00:34:11.048 --> 00:34:14.819
HELP US CONNECT WITH FOLKS THAT-NEED THIS INFORMATION AND ALSO

01:06:21.677 --> 01:06:22.945
BUSINESS OWNERS WHO HAVE BEEN

01:06:23.012 --> 01:06:25.314
VICTIMS OF RETAIL THEFT. AS WE

01:06:25.381 --> 01:06:26.582
NOTED IN FEBRUARY IMPLEMENTING

01:06:26.649 --> 01:06:28.317
THIS CONCEPT WOULD FACE A LOT OF

01:06:28.384 --> 01:06:30.386
PRACTICAL CHALLENGES AND WE

01:06:30.453 --> 01:06:31.921
HIGHLIGHTED IN PARTICULAR HOW IT

01:06:31.987 --> 01:06:33.356
WOULD LIKELY BE DIFFICULT TO

01:06:33.422 --> 01:06:35.024
DEFINE THE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA

01:06:35.091 --> 01:06:37.259
AND HOW BEST TO DOCUMENT LOSSES

01:06:37.326 --> 01:06:38.627
BUSINESS OWNERS EXPERIENCE

01:06:38.694 --> 01:06:40.963
RELATED TO BOTH. FROM LEGAL

01:06:41.030 --> 01:06:42.431
DEFINITIONS AS WELL AS I'M

01:06:42.498 --> 01:06:43.999
TRYING TO MINIMIZE THE BURDEN ON

01:06:44.066 --> 01:06:45.601
ON BUSINESSES- THAT APPLY FOR

01:06:45.668 --> 01:06:47.570
THE GRANTS AFTER REVIEWING THE

01:06:47.636 --> 01:06:48.571
TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE AND

01:06:48.637 --> 01:06:51.474
MEETING WITH- WITH DIRECTOR GRAY

01:06:51.540 --> 01:06:53.275
AND- THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF

01:06:53.342 --> 01:06:53.743
BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC

01:06:53.809 --> 01:06:54.543
DEVELOPMENT THE DEPARTMENT

01:06:54.610 --> 01:06:56.612
FINANCE WAS CLEAR THAT- THE

01:06:56.679 --> 01:06:57.480
ADMINISTRATION'S GRAPPLED WITH

01:06:57.546 --> 01:06:59.248
THESE CHALLENGES. THEY'VE

01:06:59.315 --> 01:06:59.915
THOUGHTFULLY ATTEMPTED TO

01:06:59.982 --> 01:07:03.185
BALANCE. PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS-

01:07:03.252 --> 01:07:04.520
THIS FOR OUR CURRENCY DURING

01:07:04.587 --> 01:07:06.188
CONFLICT- SO FOR EXAMPLE THE

01:07:06.255 --> 01:07:07.356
PERSON WOULD NEED TO REQUIRE

01:07:07.423 --> 01:07:08.524
SOME SORT OF DOCUMENTATION IN

01:07:08.591 --> 01:07:09.825
ORDER TO REDUCE LIKELIHOOD FRAUD

01:07:09.892 --> 01:07:11.127
WHILE ALSO BEING FLEXIBLE AND

01:07:11.193 --> 01:07:12.361
SIMPLE ENOUGH TO MINIMIZE BERMAN

01:07:12.428 --> 01:07:14.530
APPLICANTS. NONETHELESS WE NOTE

01:07:14.597 --> 01:07:15.731
THAT THE DEFINITION OF RETAIL

01:07:15.798 --> 01:07:17.466
THEFT AND THE ELIGIBILITY

01:07:17.533 --> 01:07:19.668
CRITERIA BOTH ARE QUITE BROAD

01:07:19.735 --> 01:07:21.370
AND THIS RAISES TWO MAJOR

01:07:21.437 --> 01:07:23.906
CONCERNS SO FIRST WE BELIEVE THE

01:07:23.973 --> 01:07:25.040
PROGRAM WILL QUICKLY BE

01:07:25.107 --> 01:07:26.342
OVERSUBSCRIBED. AND SECOND IT

01:07:26.409 --> 01:07:27.743
SEEMS LIKE WITH THE PROGRAMMING

01:07:27.810 --> 01:07:30.946
NOT- PROVIDE. THE THIS SORT OF

01:07:31.013 --> 01:07:32.448
ASSISTANCE THEY MIGHT HAVE IN

01:07:32.515 --> 01:07:34.417
MIND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT- YOU

01:07:34.483 --> 01:07:36.152
KNOW PROGRAM THAT'S DESIGNED TO-

01:07:36.218 --> 01:07:38.053
PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO SMALL

01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:41.424
RETAILERS AFFECTED BY ORGANIZED

01:07:41.490 --> 01:07:43.259
RETAIL. SO FIRST- OF THE TWENTY

01:07:43.325 --> 01:07:44.627
MILLION DOLLARS TO THE

01:07:44.693 --> 01:07:45.628
ADMINISTRATION'S PURPOSE FOR THE

01:07:45.694 --> 01:07:46.762
PROGRAM THREE MILLION DOLLARS

01:07:46.829 --> 01:07:47.797
WOULD BE RESERVED FOR

01:07:47.863 --> 01:07:50.266
ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. 15% ON

01:07:50.332 --> 01:07:52.067
LEADING SEVENTEEN MILLION

01:07:52.134 --> 01:07:55.037
DOLLARS FOR GRANTS. SO SKINNER.

01:07:55.104 --> 01:07:57.640
HAVE AN AVERAGE GRANT OF FIFTEEN

01:07:57.706 --> 01:07:59.275
THOUSAND DOLLARS WHICH WE THINK

01:07:59.341 --> 01:08:01.377
IS VERY REASONABLE- FOR A

01:08:01.444 --> 01:08:03.212
PROGRAM WITH A MAXIMUM OF TWENTY

01:08:03.279 --> 01:08:04.947
FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS WE

01:08:05.014 --> 01:08:05.781
ESTIMATE THE PROGRAM WOULD WORK

01:08:05.848 --> 01:08:06.816
FEWER THAN TWELVE HUNDRED

01:08:06.882 --> 01:08:07.750
GRANTS. AND GIVEN THE BROAD

01:08:07.817 --> 01:08:09.952
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA WE EXPECT

01:08:10.019 --> 01:08:11.187
THAT THE PROGRAM WOULD QUICKLY

01:08:11.253 --> 01:08:13.556
BECOME OVER STRIPED- HOWEVER WE

01:08:13.622 --> 01:08:15.458
SHOULD NOTE THAT NEITHER WE NOR

01:08:15.524 --> 01:08:16.625
THE ADMINISTRATION. HAS

01:08:16.692 --> 01:08:18.027
CONDUCTED ANALYSIS THE NUMBER OF

01:08:18.093 --> 01:08:20.296
SMALL BUSINESSES THAT THAT ARE

01:08:20.362 --> 01:08:22.131
LIKELY TO BE VICTIMS OF THEFT

01:08:22.198 --> 01:08:24.233
ARSON AND VANDALISM I BETWEEN

01:08:24.300 --> 01:08:26.168
JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO

01:08:26.235 --> 01:08:28.637
AND WITH THE PERFORMANCE- BUT I

01:08:28.704 --> 01:08:30.739
DO SAY SMALL BUSINESSES ON VERY

01:08:30.806 --> 01:08:31.440
INTENTIONALLY BECAUSE OF THE

01:08:31.507 --> 01:08:32.975
CARE THAT. PRETTY MUCH ANY

01:08:33.042 --> 01:08:35.277
BUSINESS- THAT MEETS THE REVENUE

01:08:35.344 --> 01:08:37.313
ELIGIBILITY AND HAS BEEN A

01:08:37.379 --> 01:08:38.781
VICTIM OF PROPERTY DAMAGES AFTER

01:08:38.848 --> 01:08:40.282
VANDALISM ARSON WOULD LIKELY BE

01:08:40.349 --> 01:08:42.818
ELIGIBLE. AND SO RETAILERS

01:08:42.885 --> 01:08:45.488
MAINLY COMPRISE A PORTION OF THE

01:08:45.554 --> 01:08:47.022
BUSINESSES THAT ARE ABLE TO

01:08:47.089 --> 01:08:48.324
SECURE A GRANT. ON THE FOR THE

01:08:48.390 --> 01:08:50.059
FUNDING IS EXHAUSTED AND GIVEN

01:08:50.125 --> 01:08:51.760
THESE POTENTIAL CONCERNS WERE.

01:08:51.827 --> 01:08:53.295
CONCERNED THAT BY CREATING THIS

01:08:53.362 --> 01:08:55.297
PROGRAM YOU COULD FIND YOURSELF

01:08:55.364 --> 01:08:56.799
IN A SITUATION DOWN THE ROAD

01:08:56.866 --> 01:08:59.001
WHERE- SIMILARLY TO THE SMALL

01:08:59.068 --> 01:08:59.969
BUSINESS COVERED RELIEF GRANT

01:09:00.035 --> 01:09:01.470
PROGRAM WHERE MULTIPLE

ADDITIONAL ROUNDS OF FUNDING

01:09:02.972 --> 01:09:05.975
WOULD BE REQUIRED TO MEET THE ON

01:09:06.041 --> 01:09:09.245
THE DEMAND THAT. ON THE

01:09:09.311 --> 01:09:10.412

01:09:10.479 --> 01:09:12.281
LASTLY WANTED TO THE WORLD CAN

01:09:12.348 --> 01:09:13.716
THAT THE PROBE SEEMS BE RELATIVE

01:09:13.782 --> 01:09:14.950
EXPENSIVE. SIMILAR PROGRAMS HAVE

01:09:15.017 --> 01:09:15.718
COST OF ONLY AROUND FIVE

01:09:15.784 --> 01:09:18.754
PERCENT- RELATIVE TO THE 15%

01:09:18.821 --> 01:09:20.422
HERE SET ASIDE FOR THIS PROGRAM.

01:09:20.489 --> 01:09:21.624
NOW GIVEN THE CHALLENGES POSED

01:09:21.690 --> 01:09:23.292
BY SETTING UP THIS NEW AND

01:09:23.359 --> 01:09:25.060
FAIRLY COMPLICATED PROGRAMS THAT

01:09:25.127 --> 01:09:25.728
MAY NOT BE IN A REASONABLE

01:09:25.794 --> 01:09:28.664
AMOUNT BUT IT DOES. INFORM YOUR

HUNDRED DOLLARS ADMINISTRATIVE

01:09:36.906 --> 01:09:39.441

01:10:29.258 --> 01:10:32.561
REAL- VANDALISM AND BURGLARY AND

THEFT HAVE HIT A NUMBER F OUR-

01:10:35.831 --> 01:10:37.499
BUSINESSES UP AND DOWN THE

01:10:37.566 --> 01:10:40.436
STATE. OUT WE DO HAVE TO GET A

01:10:40.502 --> 01:10:41.704
HANDLE ON IT I'M JUST WONDERING

01:10:41.770 --> 01:10:44.106
IF THERE IS A BETTER WAY FOR US

01:10:44.173 --> 01:10:46.175
TO BE COMPASSIONATE TOWARDS

01:10:46.241 --> 01:10:47.509
THOSE FOLKS WHO HAVE BEEN

01:10:47.576 --> 01:10:49.845
VICTIMS OF THEFT RATHER THAN

01:10:49.912 --> 01:10:51.447
SOMETHING LIKE THIS WHICH STILL

01:10:51.513 --> 01:10:54.483
IS RATHER VAGUE- I IF I RECALL

01:10:54.550 --> 01:10:55.684
FROM THE HEARING THAT WE HAD

01:10:55.751 --> 01:10:58.020
EARLIER IN THE YEAR THERE- WAS

01:10:58.087 --> 01:10:59.521
MENTIONED THAT THERE ARE MANY

01:10:59.588 --> 01:11:01.757
VICTIMS OF RETAIL THEFT. THAT

01:11:01.824 --> 01:11:03.425
EITHER HAVEN'T FILED REPORTS SO

THAT WERE AFRAID TO REACH OUT

01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:06.662
BECAUSE OF RETALIATION AND OTHER

01:11:06.729 --> 01:11:09.031
ISSUES AND SO MY CONCERN WOULD

01:11:09.098 --> 01:11:11.900
&lt;c.green&gt;E THAT- LARGER COMPANIES THAT&lt;/c&gt;

01:11:11.967 --> 01:11:14.169
HAVE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT KNOW

01:11:14.236 --> 01:11:15.671
HOW TO ACCESS THESE KINDS OF

01:11:15.738 --> 01:11:16.939
FUNDS THAT ACTUALLY HAVE PEOPLE

01:11:17.006 --> 01:11:20.743
ON THE PAY ROLL WHO ARE WATCHING

01:11:20.809 --> 01:11:22.444

FIND AND APPLY FOR RESOURCES

01:11:24.046 --> 01:11:25.714
WOULD BE FIRST IN LINE SINCE

THIS IS FIRST COME FIRST SERVE

01:11:27.750 --> 01:11:29.518
AND MANY OF THE SMALL BUSINESSES

01:11:29.585 --> 01:11:31.153
AND MOM AND POP BUSINESSES THAT

01:11:31.220 --> 01:11:32.554
I'VE ALSO SUFFERED FROM RETAIL

01:11:32.621 --> 01:11:33.589
THEFT AND DON'T HAVE THE

01:11:33.656 --> 01:11:35.624
CAPACITY TO DO THAT. ARE GOING

01:11:35.691 --> 01:11:38.961
TO MISS OUT- 15% ALSO SEEMS KIND

01:11:39.028 --> 01:11:40.963
OF HIGH THAT'S LIKE A BAD CREDIT

01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:42.631
CARD I WONDER WHY THE COSTS ARE

01:11:42.698 --> 01:11:44.633
SO HIGH FOR ADMINISTERING THIS

01:11:44.700 --> 01:11:48.270

01:11:52.341 --> 01:11:54.243
THE PAPER AROUND YOU KNOW JUST

01:11:54.309 --> 01:11:55.811
THE CHALLENGES WITH EDT THE

EVICTION MORATORIUM. DOLLARS AND

01:12:02.718 --> 01:12:04.553
EFFORTS AND I WOULDN'T WANT THIS

01:12:04.620 --> 01:12:06.955
TO BE ANOTHER BAD HEADLINE- AND

01:12:07.022 --> 01:12:08.891

01:12:08.957 --> 01:12:11.460
CAN COLLECT DATA. ON THE NUMBER

01:12:11.527 --> 01:12:13.362
OF SMALL MIDSIZE AND LARGE

01:12:13.429 --> 01:12:16.198
COMPANIES- THAT HAVE SUFFERED

01:12:16.265 --> 01:12:18.767
FROM ORGANIZED STAFFED AND IF WE

01:12:18.834 --> 01:12:19.935
CAN FIND ANOTHER WAY TO

01:12:20.002 --> 01:12:22.638

REPAIRS GET BACK ON TRACK.

01:12:26.675 --> 01:12:28.644
BECAUSE AN AVERAGE OF TWENTY

01:12:28.711 --> 01:12:30.612
FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS- MIGHT NOT

01:12:30.679 --> 01:12:32.214
BE WORTH THE TIME THAT IT TAKES

01:12:32.281 --> 01:12:33.916
SOMEONE TO TRYING TO HUSTLE UP

01:12:33.982 --> 01:12:35.851

THEY HAD THE ASSISTANCE THEY

01:13:50.259 --> 01:13:51.760
