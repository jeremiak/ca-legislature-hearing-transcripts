REPRESENTED EMPLOYEE WHO SEEKS

00:18:19.131 --> 00:18:20.766
INFORMAL COUNSEL.

00:18:20.833 --> 00:18:23.802
FROM SOMEONE ALSO.

00:18:23.869 --> 00:18:25.304
USING THE SAME ARGUMENTATION.

00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:27.239
THAT I WANT TO HAVE THE FREE

00:18:27.306 --> 00:18:29.775
FLOW OF IDEAS IN SEEK ADVICE

00:18:29.842 --> 00:18:31.310
FROM THOSE IN A FORMAL OR

00:18:31.376 --> 00:18:32.411
INFORMAL CAPACITY.

00:18:32.478 --> 00:18:34.079
I DON'T KNOW WE COULD HOW WE

00:18:34.146 --> 00:18:34.847
COULD ARGUE.

00:18:34.913 --> 00:18:37.516
THAT NO THIS EXCLUSION IS GOOD

00:18:37.583 --> 00:18:39.751

FROM HAVING THAT SEEM FREE FLOW

00:18:43.355 --> 00:18:45.591
OF INFORMATION HOW WOULD BE ABLE

00:18:45.657 --> 00:18:46.458
TO STOP THAT EITHER.

00:18:46.525 --> 00:18:49.161
I THINK THIS IS.

00:18:49.228 --> 00:18:50.896
A UNIQUE SITUATION BUT THE

00:18:50.963 --> 00:18:52.698
CONSEQUENCES OF EXTENDING THIS

00:18:52.764 --> 00:18:54.833
PRIVILEGE I THINK COULD BE VERY

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:55.701
DANGEROUS.

00:18:55.767 --> 00:18:56.935
BECAUSE I THINK WAS MENTIONED

00:18:57.002 --> 00:18:57.669
BEFORE.

00:18:57.736 --> 00:19:01.573
THIS IS BEEN.

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:03.976
PRUDENCE AT CERTAIN -- CERTAIN

PLACE.

00:19:07.346 --> 00:19:08.547

SO ON AND SO FORTH.

00:19:13.685 --> 00:19:15.053

00:19:18.023 --> 00:19:19.858
PROFESSIONAL REQUIREMENTS.

00:19:19.925 --> 00:19:21.059
DON'T DON'T APPEAR TO BE S. AS

00:19:21.126 --> 00:19:26.031
STRICT -- IS THERE ANOTHER WAY

00:19:26.098 --> 00:19:27.966
FORWARD.

00:19:28.033 --> 00:19:29.935
THAT CAN ALLOW FOR A FREE FLOW

00:19:30.002 --> 00:19:31.937
OF INFORMATION MAYBE I'LL ASK

00:19:32.004 --> 00:19:34.773

EXTENDING THE PRIVILEGE IN SUCH

00:19:40.812 --> 00:19:41.914
A WAY THAT WOULD BE MORE

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:43.348
POWERFUL THAN THE EXISTING

00:19:43.415 --> 00:19:44.850
ATTORNEY CLIENT.

AND THAT'S JUST THAT'S A

00:19:57.129 --> 00:19:57.996
STRIKING DEVIATION.

00:19:58.063 --> 00:19:59.331

THIS IS NOT SOMETHING NEW.

00:20:23.956 --> 00:20:25.757
THIS PROVISIONS EXIT IS THIS A

THERE'S NO DOUBT THE AGING ALSO

00:20:49.648 --> 00:20:50.315

00:21:05.263 --> 00:21:05.597
CITIES.

00:21:05.664 --> 00:21:06.865
WHEN  WAS ON THE SOUND IS CITY

00:21:06.932 --> 00:21:09.101
COUNCIL?

00:21:09.167 --> 00:21:11.103
THE SUGGESTION THAT SOMEHOW.

00:21:11.169 --> 00:21:12.104
THE CITY WAS LOOKING OUT FOR THE

00:21:12.170 --> 00:21:14.806
BEST INTEREST OF THE EMPLOYEE.

00:21:14.873 --> 00:21:16.308
YOU KNOW I I JUST DON'T THINK

00:21:16.375 --> 00:21:16.842
IT'S FACTUAL I THINK WERE

00:21:16.908 --> 00:21:17.809
FINDING MORE MORE CONTENTION

00:21:17.876 --> 00:21:18.777
THAT'S EXISTING.

00:21:18.844 --> 00:21:19.311
BETWEEN OF THE MANAGEMENT

00:21:19.378 --> 00:21:20.412
WHETHER IT BE PRIVATE SECTOR OR

00:21:20.479 --> 00:21:21.813
PUBLIC AND THE WORKER AND SO

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:23.215
THAT'S WHY THAT PROTECTION NEEDS

00:21:23.281 --> 00:21:24.182
TO BE THERE FOR BOTH.

00:21:24.249 --> 00:21:24.983
ENDS OF THIS COMMUNICATION

00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:26.118
BECAUSE OFTEN TIMES THE

00:21:26.184 --> 00:21:27.753
COMMUNICATIONS BEING USED

00:21:27.819 --> 00:21:29.554
AGAINST ALL WORKERS.

00:21:29.621 --> 00:21:30.489
WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO I THE

00:21:30.555 --> 00:21:31.757
CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS ARE COMES

00:21:31.823 --> 00:21:33.725
DOWN TO A WHOLE WIDE SLEW OF

00:21:33.792 --> 00:21:37.829
ISSUES THAT NOW?

00:21:37.896 --> 00:21:40.532
ARE BEING MORE AND MORE

00:21:40.599 --> 00:21:40.832
[inaudible]

00:21:40.899 --> 00:21:44.036
THE THE AGGRESSIVELY OF

00:21:44.102 --> 00:21:45.771
CONFLICTED WITH THE IN IN THIS

00:21:45.837 --> 00:21:46.104
DAY AND AGE.

00:21:46.171 --> 00:21:47.305
THAT'S WHY I BELIEVE THAT THIS

00:21:47.372 --> 00:21:47.806
IS NARROWLY TAILORED AS

00:21:47.873 --> 00:21:49.241
NECESSARY FOR THE PURPOSE OF

00:21:49.307 --> 00:21:50.475
PROTECTING THAT RELATIONSHIP.

00:21:50.542 --> 00:21:52.310
HOW WOULD THIS BE DIFFERENT?

00:21:52.377 --> 00:21:54.379
IF YOU HAD AN ON REPRESENTED

00:21:54.446 --> 00:21:56.314
EMPLOYEE WHO SOUGHT THE INFORM

00:21:56.381 --> 00:21:58.116
INFORMAL COUNCIL.

00:21:58.183 --> 00:22:00.786
OUR REGARDING WORKPLACE ISSUE

00:22:00.852 --> 00:22:01.319
SHOULD THAT INDIVIDUAL BE

00:22:01.386 --> 00:22:04.389
AFFORDED PROTECTION TO PROMOTE.

00:22:04.456 --> 00:22:06.591
FREE DISCOURSE OF THOUGHTS AND

00:22:06.658 --> 00:22:11.930
RECOMMENDATIONS.

00:22:11.997 --> 00:22:13.098
THROUGH THE CHAIR AT OUT -- I

00:22:13.165 --> 00:22:13.665
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE

00:22:13.732 --> 00:22:14.966
THAT THE UNION REPRESENTATIVE

00:22:15.033 --> 00:22:16.568
HAS A LEGAL OBLIGATIONS

00:22:16.635 --> 00:22:17.669
REPRESENT.

00:22:17.736 --> 00:22:18.937
MEMBERS AND NON MEMBERS ALL

00:22:19.004 --> 00:22:20.038
WORKERS ARE COVERED UNDER THE

00:22:20.105 --> 00:22:21.573
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:22.541
SO REGARDLESS IF YOU'RE A MEMBER

00:22:22.607 --> 00:22:24.943
OF THE UNION OR IF YOU'RE NOT A

00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:26.111
MEMBER IF YOU'RE COVERED UNDER

00:22:26.178 --> 00:22:26.311
THAT.

00:22:26.378 --> 00:22:27.479
SELECT BARGAINING AGREEMENT

00:22:27.546 --> 00:22:28.680
BETWEEN THE THE YOUR PRESENT IT

00:22:28.747 --> 00:22:29.915
HAS A LEGAL OBLIGATION TO

00:22:29.981 --> 00:22:31.349
REPRESENT YOU IN THOSE MATTERS I

00:22:31.416 --> 00:22:36.221
THINK THAT'S A DISTINCTION FROM

00:22:36.288 --> 00:22:37.823
AN EMPLOYEE TALKING.

00:22:37.889 --> 00:22:39.658
TO SOME THIRD PARTY TO GET

00:22:39.725 --> 00:22:42.461
ADVICE WORDS -- TO TO TO GAUGE

00:22:42.527 --> 00:22:43.028
INTEREST OR THINGS LIKE THAT

00:22:43.095 --> 00:22:43.729
THAT THAT THAT A LEGAL

00:22:43.795 --> 00:22:45.130
OBLIGATION REPRESENTATION

00:22:45.197 --> 00:22:46.331
WOULDN'T EXIST IN THAT MATTER SO

00:22:46.398 --> 00:22:47.999
IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT.

00:22:48.066 --> 00:22:49.367
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS SENATOR

00:22:49.434 --> 00:22:52.370
UMBERG.

00:22:52.437 --> 00:22:52.971
YOU RAISE AN INTERESTING POINT

00:22:53.038 --> 00:22:56.541
JUST -- SUMMER KALRA YOU'D SAID

00:22:56.608 --> 00:22:57.442
THAT THERE IS IF I UNDERSTOOD

00:22:57.509 --> 00:22:59.344
YOU CORRECTLY THERE IS A DUTY TO

00:22:59.411 --> 00:23:01.580
THE INDIVIDUAL WHO COMMUNICATES

00:23:01.646 --> 00:23:02.981
TO THE AGENT.

00:23:03.048 --> 00:23:03.648
IS THAT RIGHT THAT'S CORRECT AND

00:23:03.715 --> 00:23:07.552
THEN AT THAT AGING HAS A DUTY TO

00:23:07.619 --> 00:23:09.921
THE UNION AS WELL IS THAT RIGHT.

00:23:09.988 --> 00:23:10.922
AND SO IT IS IN IN THIS

00:23:10.989 --> 00:23:11.857
HYPOTHETICAL THAT'S A

00:23:11.923 --> 00:23:13.759
RESPONSIBILITY TO BUT NOT THAT

00:23:13.825 --> 00:23:15.660
THE PRIVILEGES NOT FOR THE I'M.

00:23:15.727 --> 00:23:16.495
I'M IN GENERAL THERE'S

00:23:16.561 --> 00:23:17.429
RESPONSIBILITY TO THE UNION BUT

00:23:17.496 --> 00:23:20.432
THIS CASE THAT THIS PRIVILEGES

00:23:20.499 --> 00:23:22.934
BETWEEN.

00:23:23.001 --> 00:23:24.870
IN REPRESENTATIVE AND THE WORKER

00:23:24.936 --> 00:23:27.906
HAND IN PLACE.

00:23:27.973 --> 00:23:29.107
AND SO IT'S A TWO WAY BE.

00:23:29.174 --> 00:23:30.542
A MOTHER BARBARA THERE'S THERE'S

00:23:30.609 --> 00:23:31.743
NOT EXPENSE A PRIVILEGE TO THE

00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:34.012
ENTIRE ORGANIZATION ALL THIS ALL

00:23:34.079 --> 00:23:36.214
THE WORKERS.

00:23:36.281 --> 00:23:37.015
OKAY LOOK LET ME ASK YOU A

00:23:37.082 --> 00:23:37.949
HYPOTHETICAL IT'S BASED ON REAL

00:23:38.016 --> 00:23:39.184
EVENTS.

00:23:39.251 --> 00:23:41.119
SO IF TO EMPLOYEES EMPLOYEE ONE

00:23:41.186 --> 00:23:43.088
LET'S ASSUME AS A WOMAN EMPLOYEE

00:23:43.155 --> 00:23:44.723
TO LET'S ASSUME IS A MAN.

00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:46.525
PLOY ONE REPORTS TO MANAGEMENT

00:23:46.591 --> 00:23:49.394
THAT EMPLOYEE TO IS CALLED HER

00:23:49.461 --> 00:23:51.429
SIX TIMES THE PREVIOUS DAY. FIVE

00:23:51.496 --> 00:23:52.697
TIMES A DAY BEFORE THAT FOUR

00:23:52.764 --> 00:23:54.266
TIMES THE BEFORE THAT SHE'S NOT

00:23:54.332 --> 00:23:57.302
RESPONDED EMPLOYEE TO HAS MADE.

00:23:57.369 --> 00:23:58.770
INAPPROPRIATE OVERTURES TO HER

00:23:58.837 --> 00:24:00.405
EMPLOYEE TO HIS VISITOR HOUSE A

00:24:00.472 --> 00:24:02.174
NUMBER OF TIMES THE LAST FOR

00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:03.375
FIVE DAYS.

00:24:03.441 --> 00:24:05.076
EMPLOYEE ONE THE WOMAN REPORTS

00:24:05.143 --> 00:24:07.445
AT THE MANAGEMENT MANAGEMENT.

00:24:07.512 --> 00:24:09.447
IS CONCERNED AND THEY DISCIPLINE

00:24:09.514 --> 00:24:11.550
EMPLOYEE TO EMPLOYEE TO GOES TO

00:24:11.616 --> 00:24:13.819
HIS UNION AGENT AND SAYS.

00:24:13.885 --> 00:24:15.587
I'M NOT HARASSING HER I DON'T

00:24:15.654 --> 00:24:17.155
CONSIDER THESE PHONE CALLS AND

00:24:17.222 --> 00:24:18.657
VISITS TO HER HOME TO BE

00:24:18.723 --> 00:24:20.225
HARASSMENT AND I INTEND TO

00:24:20.292 --> 00:24:22.127
CONTINUE TO DO EXACTLY THAT

00:24:22.194 --> 00:24:23.461
BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT IF I

00:24:23.528 --> 00:24:25.397
CONTINUE THIS BEHAVIOR THAT THIS

00:24:25.463 --> 00:24:26.665
WOMAN EVENTUALLY.

00:24:26.731 --> 00:24:30.368
WILL SEE THE LIGHT AND BASICALLY

00:24:30.435 --> 00:24:32.437
HAVE A RELATIONSHIP.

00:24:32.504 --> 00:24:34.706
SO THE QUESTION IS IS THE UNION

00:24:34.773 --> 00:24:36.708
AGENT WHO HAS RECEIVED THIS

00:24:36.775 --> 00:24:38.710
DISCLOSURE DOES HERE SHE HAVE

00:24:38.777 --> 00:24:45.517
ANY DUTY TO EMPLOYEE NUMBER.

00:24:45.584 --> 00:24:47.052
ONE SO IN OTHER WORDS DOES DOES

00:24:47.118 --> 00:24:48.520
THE UNION AGENT THEN HAVE ANY

00:24:48.587 --> 00:24:50.322
DUTY TO COME FORWARD. TO SAY

00:24:50.388 --> 00:24:52.123
THAT THIS EMPLOYEE IS GOING TO

00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:54.392
CONTINUE THIS BY ALL ACCOUNTS

00:24:54.459 --> 00:24:55.861
OTHER THAN UNION THE OTHER THAN

00:24:55.927 --> 00:24:57.829
EMPLOYEE TWOS.

00:24:57.896 --> 00:25:01.499
HARASSMENT OF EMPLOYEE NUMBER.

00:25:01.566 --> 00:25:03.635
ONE THERE'S NOT A IN THE

00:25:03.702 --> 00:25:04.469
PROPOSED BILL THERE'S THERE'S

00:25:04.536 --> 00:25:05.971
NOT A DUTY TO AN ACID BUT THE

00:25:06.037 --> 00:25:08.273
PRIVILEGE WOULD NOT ATTACHED IF

00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:11.376
THERE WAS IT WAS AN ON GOING --

00:25:11.443 --> 00:25:13.411
CRIMES SO IF THERE WAS CITY ROSE

00:25:13.478 --> 00:25:15.513
LEVEL OF BEING CRIMINAL BY THEN

00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:16.748
DID YOU WOULDN'T HAVE A DUTY TO

00:25:16.815 --> 00:25:17.649
REPORT BUT THEY WERE THERE WOULD

00:25:17.716 --> 00:25:18.416
BE NO PROTECTION.

00:25:18.483 --> 00:25:19.784
UNDER THE PRIVILEGE EXIT THE

00:25:19.851 --> 00:25:22.053
THIS IS NOT A CRIME WELL IT

00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:23.288
COULD BE A CRIME THIS IS

00:25:23.355 --> 00:25:24.723
STALKING.

00:25:24.789 --> 00:25:25.991
WELL IT IS CLEAR THAT THE REFS

00:25:26.057 --> 00:25:26.791
BUT THERE'S THERE'S A THERE'S A

00:25:26.858 --> 00:25:28.226
QUESTION THERE AS TO WHAT LEVEL

00:25:28.293 --> 00:25:29.294
WHAT RISE THE LEVEL.

00:25:29.361 --> 00:25:31.129
OF A CRIME AND WHO MAKES THAT

00:25:31.196 --> 00:25:31.963
DETERMINATION.

00:25:32.030 --> 00:25:39.170
SO THE SECOND QUESTION THEN IS.

00:25:39.237 --> 00:25:39.804
IF IT EVEN ATTORNEY RECEIVES A

00:25:39.871 --> 00:25:41.606
COMMUNICATION AND THE ATTORNEY

00:25:41.673 --> 00:25:42.807
DISCLOSE IT RIGHT.

00:25:42.874 --> 00:25:46.077
SO BY THE WAY EVEN IF IT'S A AN

00:25:46.144 --> 00:25:47.879
OUT AND OUT THE THE ATTORNEY IS

00:25:47.946 --> 00:25:48.914
ONLY REQUIRED TO DISCLOSE IF

00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:49.681
THERE'S GOING TO BE IMMINENT

00:25:49.748 --> 00:25:50.248
BODILY HARM OR SOME OTHER.

00:25:50.315 --> 00:25:51.549
SERIOUS HARM.

00:25:51.616 --> 00:25:52.150
THERE'S NO INDICATION AS HARM

00:25:52.217 --> 00:25:53.852
HERE THE QUESTION IS IS LET'S

00:25:53.919 --> 00:25:55.954
SAY THAT UNION AGENT THEN SAYS

00:25:56.021 --> 00:25:57.355
YOU KNOW WHAT I AM GOING TO

00:25:57.422 --> 00:25:58.990
PROTECT EMPLOYEE NUMBER.

00:25:59.057 --> 00:26:00.926
ONE I'M GOING TO INFORM EMPLOYEE

00:26:00.992 --> 00:26:02.794
NUMBER ONE THAT THIS PERSON IS

00:26:02.861 --> 00:26:04.963
CAN GOING TO CONTINUE TO HARASS.

00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:07.299
YOU IS THERE ANY SANCTION THAT

00:26:07.365 --> 00:26:08.600
IS APPLIED TO THE UNION AGENT

00:26:08.667 --> 00:26:09.701
FOR EXAMPLE AN ATTORNEY WHO

00:26:09.768 --> 00:26:10.869
DISCLOSE AN ATTORNEY CLIENT

00:26:10.936 --> 00:26:12.604
PRIVILEGE COMMUNICATION THEN CAN

00:26:12.671 --> 00:26:14.072
BE POTENTIALLY BEEN DISBARRED SO

00:26:14.139 --> 00:26:15.073
IS THERE ANY.

00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:16.808
SANCTION IT CAN BE APPLIED TO

00:26:16.875 --> 00:26:18.176
THE UNIONREPRESENTATIVE.

00:26:18.243 --> 00:26:20.245
NOT IT NOT IN THE LEGISLATION

00:26:20.312 --> 00:26:21.713
AND AS YOU POINT OUT CENTER THAT

00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:23.648
SANCTION WOULD COME FROM THE A

00:26:23.715 --> 00:26:26.284
PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATION -- NOT

I'M NOT SURE I FULLY UNDERSTAND

00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:50.548
IF IT RELATES TO A DUTY TO

00:30:50.615 --> 00:30:52.684

ATTORNEY ENDER THAT'S NOT A

00:38:03.347 --> 00:38:04.582
PRIVILEGED COMMUNICATION.

JUST BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO BE

ANOTHER TURNING IT HAVE TO BE A

00:38:07.451 --> 00:38:08.319
UNION REP.

00:38:08.386 --> 00:38:09.720
THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS BILL

00:38:09.787 --> 00:38:12.189
THAT EDUCATES THE DOOR A UNION

00:38:12.256 --> 00:38:13.791
REPRESENTATIVE SAID THAT'S NOT

00:38:13.858 --> 00:38:14.892

THAT BUT THERE'S A BUNCH OF

00:38:19.897 --> 00:38:21.065
HARASSMENT IN.

00:38:21.132 --> 00:38:23.034
IN CHALLENGES IN THE WORK FORCE

00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:26.270
IF YOU'RE REPRESENTING EVERYBODY.

00:38:26.337 --> 00:38:27.171
THAT WE DON'T DO THAT IN THE LAW

00:38:27.238 --> 00:38:28.906
AND THE ON A PRIVILEGE WE

00:38:28.973 --> 00:38:30.675
REPRESENT ONE PERSON HEY YOU YOU

00:38:30.741 --> 00:38:32.610
RAISE A OF A GREAT POINT I WOULD

00:38:32.677 --> 00:38:33.177
NOTE THAT THE SCOPE

00:38:33.244 --> 00:38:35.279
REPRESENTATION IS DEFINED IN THE

00:38:35.346 --> 00:38:36.714
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT.

00:38:36.781 --> 00:38:38.215
SO WHEN THE TWO PARTIES WHEN THE

00:38:38.282 --> 00:38:40.051
UNION AND THE MANAGEMENT --

00:38:40.117 --> 00:38:41.085
ORGANIZATION SET THE TABLE

00:38:41.152 --> 00:38:42.520
THAT'S THE DOCUMENT THAT DEFINES

00:38:42.586 --> 00:38:44.388
OUR SCOPE REPRESENTATION AND IN

00:38:44.455 --> 00:38:46.257
OUR REPRESENTATION IS NARAL TO

00:38:46.323 --> 00:38:47.258
THE FOUR CORNERS THAT CONTRACT

00:38:47.324 --> 00:38:48.893
SO WHILE MIGHT NOT BE DELINEATED

00:38:48.959 --> 00:38:50.861
IN THE BILL.

00:38:50.928 --> 00:38:51.829
OBVIOUSLY YOU ONLY HAVE A UNION

00:38:51.896 --> 00:38:53.264
IN THE CONTEXT OF THE COLLECTIVE

00:38:53.330 --> 00:38:54.498
BARGAINING AGREEMENT AND THAT

00:38:54.565 --> 00:38:56.200
THE DOCUMENT YOU REFERRED TO FOR

00:38:56.267 --> 00:38:57.935
YOUR SCHOOL REPRESENTATION.

00:38:58.002 --> 00:39:07.211
AND AND MILLIONS ALL THE TIME.

00:39:07.278 --> 00:39:09.480
EDUCATE OUR STEWARDS AND EDUCATE --

00:39:09.547 --> 00:39:11.449
ARE EVERYTHING IS STAFF WON THE

00:39:11.515 --> 00:39:13.184
CONTRACT IN IT IS WILL ASK HE'S

00:39:13.250 --> 00:39:13.784
NOT SHOULD ELABORATE AND SAY

00:39:13.851 --> 00:39:14.985
IT'S GOOD REPRESENTATION WILL

00:39:15.052 --> 00:39:16.654
ALSO BE DELINEATED AND THEIR

00:39:16.721 --> 00:39:17.254
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING STATUTES

00:39:17.321 --> 00:39:17.555
AS WELL SO.

00:39:17.621 --> 00:39:20.291
THOSE WILL BE THE DOCUMENTS THAT

00:39:20.357 --> 00:39:21.459
WOULD DELINEATE.

00:39:21.525 --> 00:39:22.193
OUR OBLIGATIONS TO THE EMPLOYEE

00:39:22.259 --> 00:39:22.827
WHICH WOULD BE NEGOTIATED WITH

00:39:22.893 --> 00:39:23.394
THE EMPLOYER.

00:39:23.461 --> 00:39:24.729
SO WOULD YOU BE.

00:39:24.795 --> 00:39:25.563
AND AND I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN

00:39:25.629 --> 00:39:26.197
I THINK THE WITH THAT WERE KIND

00:39:26.263 --> 00:39:27.465
OF TALKING AT DIFFERENT LEVELS

00:39:27.531 --> 00:39:28.065
HERE WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS AS

00:39:28.132 --> 00:39:28.332
LAWYERS.

00:39:28.399 --> 00:39:28.966
YOU'RE LOOKING AT THIS AS THE

00:39:29.033 --> 00:39:30.134
RESPONSIBILITIES YOU HAVE

00:39:30.201 --> 00:39:30.835
PURSUANT TO A COLLECTIVE

00:39:30.901 --> 00:39:32.770
BARGAINING AGREEMENT WHICH ISN'T

00:39:32.837 --> 00:39:33.904
REFERENCED HERE.

00:39:33.971 --> 00:39:36.173
AND I WOULD LIKE TO SUGGEST THAT

00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:37.708
WORSE IS BILLS SUPPOSED TO GO

00:39:37.775 --> 00:39:39.977
NEXT.

00:39:40.044 --> 00:39:44.448
SENATE FLOOR -- WE NEED IT I

00:39:44.515 --> 00:39:45.950
THINK WE NEED TO CLARIFY THAT

00:39:46.016 --> 00:39:47.384
BECAUSE I THINK WE ALL SHARE

00:39:47.451 --> 00:39:48.919
THAT CONCERN AND AND SOME OF US

00:39:48.986 --> 00:39:50.121
HAVE STARTED FROM THIS

00:39:50.187 --> 00:39:52.423
PERSPECTIVE IN SOME OF OVER HERE.

00:39:52.490 --> 00:39:54.125
USING OUR EXPERIENCES LAWYERS

00:39:54.191 --> 00:39:56.560
WHERE WE DO A VERY SPECIFIC.

00:39:56.627 --> 00:39:58.162
NOT ONLY LIMITATIONS BUT

00:39:58.229 --> 00:39:59.797
SANCTIONS IF WE DON'T.

00:39:59.864 --> 00:40:03.134
RESPECT THAT RELATIONSHIP SO --

00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:04.401
I WONDER IF WE COULD.

00:40:04.468 --> 00:40:06.137
PERHAPS.

00:40:06.203 --> 00:40:08.839
TIGHTEN THAT UP IF THAT IS THE I

00:40:08.906 --> 00:40:10.674
I I SHARE THAT CONCERN BUT I

00:40:10.741 --> 00:40:12.710
ALSO WAS FOCUSING ON THE

00:40:12.777 --> 00:40:13.978
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING NATURE.

00:40:14.044 --> 00:40:15.613
IT SETS THE PARAMETERS BUT

00:40:15.679 --> 00:40:17.915
THAT'S NOT IT IS NOT CLEARLY

00:40:17.982 --> 00:40:19.650
SPECIFIED IN THE BILL MADAM

00:40:19.717 --> 00:40:21.051
CHAIR CENTERS I'M MORE THAN

00:40:21.118 --> 00:40:23.087
HAPPY TO TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON

00:40:23.154 --> 00:40:25.689
THIS A WORK SPACE AND AND AND

00:40:25.756 --> 00:40:26.357
COME TO YOUR SPECIFIC OFFICES AS

00:40:26.423 --> 00:40:28.692
WE CONTINUE TO WORK TO CLARIFY.

00:40:28.759 --> 00:40:30.227
IT IS DIFFERENT THAN ATTORNEY

00:40:30.294 --> 00:40:31.162
CLIENT PRIVILEGE I HAVE

00:40:31.228 --> 00:40:36.000
OBVIOUSLY VERY WELL AWARE.

00:40:36.066 --> 00:40:39.336
OF THE VERY -- ORTON A TRIP

00:40:39.403 --> 00:40:41.739
RELATIONSHIP TO THE ATTORNEY

00:40:41.806 --> 00:40:42.907
CLIENT.

00:40:42.973 --> 00:40:43.841
PRIVILEGE RIGHTFULLY HAS THIS IS

00:40:43.908 --> 00:40:45.409
A DIFFERENT KIND OF OF PRIVILEGE

00:40:45.476 --> 00:40:46.277
BUT I THINK THAT WOULD REQUIRE

00:40:46.343 --> 00:40:47.244
GREATER CLARITY THAN CURRENTLY

00:40:47.311 --> 00:40:48.512
EXISTS TO FOR THE COME FOR THE

00:40:48.579 --> 00:40:50.447
SENATE -- THE SENATORS AND SO

00:40:50.514 --> 00:40:51.482
I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO GET YOU

00:40:51.549 --> 00:40:52.850
TO WORK ON THAT WITH THE

00:40:52.917 --> 00:40:53.951
ASSISTANCE OF YOUR YOUR STAFF IS

00:40:54.018 --> 00:40:55.052
I I THINK IT WOULD PROBABLY BE

00:40:55.119 --> 00:40:56.587
MOST HELPFUL IF YOU WORK

00:40:56.654 --> 00:40:59.256
DIRECTLY WITH OUR STAFF WE ALSO

00:40:59.323 --> 00:41:01.091
HEARD THIS BILL LAST YEAR -- IT

00:41:01.158 --> 00:41:02.326
DID GET TO THE GOVERNOR HE DID

00:41:02.393 --> 00:41:04.228
EXPRESS SOME CONCERNS AND I

00:41:04.295 --> 00:41:07.731
THINK THAT HAS -- IT ENGENDERED

00:41:07.798 --> 00:41:09.533
SOME ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS THAT I

00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:11.368
THINK ARE LEGITIMATE -- BUT I'M

00:41:11.435 --> 00:41:12.670
NOT BUT I DON'T THINK THAT'S

00:41:12.736 --> 00:41:15.439
WHAT YOU WERE ANTICIPATING TO BE

00:41:15.506 --> 00:41:16.974
A PROBLEM SO IF WE COULD PERHAPS

00:41:17.041 --> 00:41:18.876
I'M GONNA ALLOW A COMMENT FROM

00:41:18.943 --> 00:41:21.011

00:41:21.078 --> 00:41:21.679

WITH YOUR SOME.

00:41:27.418 --> 00:41:28.118
THE WILLINGNESS WILL.

00:41:28.185 --> 00:41:29.453
PUT THIS OVER PERHAPS A WEEK AND

00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:29.987
WILL TRY TO CLEAN THIS UP

00:41:30.054 --> 00:41:31.255
BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE ALL.

00:41:31.322 --> 00:41:33.791
THE A LITTLE UNSURE OF WHAT THIS

00:41:33.858 --> 00:41:34.758

THAT OUR CLIENTS CANNOT DISCLOSE

00:41:53.944 --> 00:41:55.346
THE COMMUNICATIONS THAT WE HAVE

00:41:55.412 --> 00:41:57.982

WITH FOLKS BUT PART OF THE

00:42:46.897 --> 00:42:47.965
PROBLEM IS THAT.

00:42:48.032 --> 00:42:50.501
IT IN A SITUATION WHERE YOU HAVE

00:42:50.567 --> 00:42:55.639

00:43:10.888 --> 00:43:12.323
CERTAIN ISSUE BUT IT HAS A

00:43:12.389 --> 00:43:14.024

OF THAT THAT'S A PRETTY UNIQUE.

00:43:20.597 --> 00:43:21.799
