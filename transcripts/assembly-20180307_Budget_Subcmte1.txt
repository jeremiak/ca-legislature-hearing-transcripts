THIS WILL BEGIN TODAY'S SUB ONE HEARING ITS ARE THIRD HEARING OF THE YEAR. WE WILL START WITH ISSUE ONE DEPARTMENT OF REHABILITATION IF YOU CAN COME FORWARD. AND PERCENT BEFORE WE BEGIN I'D LIKE TO ESTABLISH QUORUM. DOCTOR ARAMBULA. HERE. HARPER. NOT THIS HERE RUBIO. WOULD. QUORUM. THANK YOU WITH THAT IF COULD HAVE OUR FIRST PANEL BEGINS. SO. THIS IS NOT OKAY THANK YOU. SO GRADING SOME GOOD AFTERNOON. I WANTED TO. FIRST START BY. JUST THINKING THE MEMBERS. I AM I HAVE TODAY WITH ME KELLY HIGH GRAYSON DIRECTOR OF JOBS EVEN FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF REHABILITATION I HAVE WITH ME TODAY. KELLY HARGREAVES IS A CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR. AND EVEN THOUGH OUR IN Y. LATE WAS LISTED ON THE AGENDA SHE ENFORCEMENT AS SALES NOT ABLE TO BE WITH US TODAY. WE CERTAINLY ALWAYS LOOK FORWARD. AN OPPORTUNITY TO SHOW ABOUT OUR PROGRAMS AND CERTAINLY TO ANSWERING YOUR QUESTIONS. THAT YOU MAY HAVE. THE AGENDA DOES A GOOD JOB OF DESCRIBING THE TOPIC SO I JUST WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE OF THE. VIETNAM. ISSUES ON THE AGENDA. ONE IS THAT THE INDEPENDENT LIVING SERVICES SECTION STAFF IS SUPPORTED WHAT PROGRAM INCOME. AND THAT WE HAVE BEEN USING A PROGRAM INCOME TO SUPPORT THE TRANSITION OF STUDENT SERVICES FROM. TO TO STUDENT SERVICES FROM THE ADULT SERVICES SIDE IS A FIFTEEN PERCENT SHIFT THAT WAS MANDATED BY FEDERAL STATUTE. AS A RESULT OF. ARE THE CHANGES IN THE W. WHEN I AND EIGHT WORKFORCE INVENTION OPPORTUNITY I ACT. WE WERE RESTRICTED TO GIVE MINISTRATION OF UNIT PET LIVING SERVICES SECTION STAFF DEFY PERCENT SO ABOUT NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS SHIFTED. TO BE AVAILABLE TO THE NETWORK TO PROVIDE THE. FUNDING FOR THE PRIORITIES OF THE STATE PLAN FOR INDEPENDENT LIVING. AND THEN A COUPLE OF OTHER QUICK TOPICS I'M FOR YOU WOULD BE THE PROGRAM INCOME. AND WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR ME TO CONTINUE TO POINT OUT ABOUT PROGRAM INCOME IS AT ITS GENERATED. FROM INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE ON SUPPLEMENTAL SECURITY INCOME WHO DO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO BACK TO WORK. WHO ARE ATTAINING EARNINGS ABOVE SUBSTANTIAL GAINFUL ACTIVITY? AND THOSE WHO OF COURSE ARE STAYING AT WORK FOR AT LEAST. NINETY DAYS. WE DO ANTICIPATE THAT AS A RESULT OF A SHIFT IN OUR CASE LOAD TO A MUCH YOUNGER POPULATION. THAT WHAT ABOUT THE PROGRAM INCOME WOULD BE IMPACTED IN YEARS TO COME. THE PROGRAM INCOME IS OF COURSE A MANDATED USE FOR THE VOCATIONAL REHABILITATION PROGRAM IT'S ALLOWED USE. FOR THE INDEPENDENT LIVING SERVICES PROGRAM THE OLDER INDIVIDUALS WERE BLAMED PROGRAM. ONE OF THE FINAL TOPIC WOULD BE ORDER OF SELECTION. OUT WE TODAY ARE IN ORDER OF SELECTION IT AS A MECHANISM OF THE FEDERAL LAW FOR COST CONTAINMENT ONE WE DO NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT FUNDS. TO MEET ALL OF THAT NEED. AND. WHILE IN RECENT YEARS WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CLEAR THE WAITING LIST FOR THAT WE HAVE BEEN IGNORED OF SELECTION SINCE THE MID NINETIES. AND THE LONG TERM. USE OF ORDER OF SELECTION AS A COST CONTAINMENT HAS CREATED DETERRENT FOR PEOPLE WHO WOULD OTHERWISE APPLY FOR OUR SERVICES. THANK YOU. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE LA WHEN IT COMES. ANY PUBLIC COMMENTS ON ISSUE ONE AT THIS TIME. TARGET AREA MARKET. I AM WITH THE CALIFORNIA FOUNDATION FOR INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTERS. AND WE REPRESENT TWENTY ONE OF. CALIFORNIA'S TWENTY EIGHT INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTERS. WE STRONG SUPPORTER PROPOSAL TO MOVE TOWARD AN EQUITABLE FUNDING FORMULA THAT INCLUDES FACTORS SUCH AS BASE FUNDING POPULATION GEOGRAPHY. AND THE COST OF LIVING INDEX. THE PARTNER CREEP WITH PATIENTS OF REPORT INDICATES THAT THERE'S BEEN A POSITIVE IMPACT ON SERVING PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. THROUGHOUT THE STATE'S. THROUGH THE STATE'S REASON INVESTMENT OF A MODEST SEVEN HUNDRED FIVE THOUSAND. DOLLAR INVESTMENT FOR THREE OF OUR CENTERS. UP WE BELIEVE THAT OUR NETWORK OF CENTERS IS A COST EFFECTIVE INVESTMENT. THAT IMPROVES CALIFORNIA'S HEALTH SILT TERMINATION AND INDEPENDENCE OUTCOMES FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. HOWEVER WE BELIEVE THAT AN APPROPRIATELY FUNDED EVIDENCE BASED STUDY OF CALIFORNIA'S TWENTY EIGHT. AND URBAN LIVING CENTERS IN THE ROLE IN IMPACTING. A SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH IS OVERDUE. WE BELIEVE THAT. OUTCOMES AND METRICS DERIVED FROM SUCH A STUDY. TO CREATE CONDITIONS WHERE CALIFORNIA'S HEALTH CARE SYSTEM SEES VALUE. AND INCREASES PARTNERSHIPS. AND INVESTMENT THROUGH MODELS OF CARE THAT INCLUDE INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTERS. SUCH A STUDY WOULD AMPLIFY THE INDUSTRY LEVEL CASE FOR CROSS SECTOR PARTNERSHIPS. AS AFFECT A STRATEGY FOR HEALTH SYSTEM IMPROVEMENT. PROMOTE NEW WAYS OF THINKING AND. HAVE OF FOLKS ARMS SERVICE DESIGN. IT POSITIONS THE INDEPENDENT LIVING NETWORK TO BE ACTIVE PARTNERS WHO ARE VALUED. FOR OUR. FOR I LIVED DIFFICULT EXPERIENCES PROFESSIONAL HIGH PERFORMING A QUALITY LIFE OUTCOME. ALSO WOULD CREATE CONDITIONS WHERE CALIFORNIA'S HEALTH CARE SYSTEM SEES VALUE AND INVESTMENT MODELS OF CARE THAT INCLUDE IN THE PEDDLING CENTERS. AND OUR INTEGRATED PERSON CENTERED AND COST EFFECTIVE. IT WOULD FINALLY ALLOW INFINITE LIVING SENATE CREATE A NEW REVENUE STREAM. OR REVENUE GENERATING CONTRACTS WITH HEALTH CARE LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORT ENTITY. WE ASK THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND TO YOU OUR SUPPORT THE I'LL NETWORK IN BUILDING SUCH A STUDY. WITH THE OVERALL INTENT OF IMPROVING POPULATION HEALTH IN QUALITY OF LIFE FOR OUR DISABLED AGING COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR. HI. I'M SUSAN MILLER KNOWN AS TANK MILLER EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR PLASTER INDEPENDENT RESOURCE SERVICES IN AUBURN WE ARE ONE OF THE THREE INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTERS THAT HAVE BENEFITTED FROM THE SPECIAL ALLOCATION THIS YEAR OF FUNDING. US SINCE WE DO NOT RECEIVE BASE FUNDS AND WHICH IS INCLUDED AGAIN IN THE GOVERNOR'S. PROPOSED BUDGET FOR THE COMING YEAR ON AND I JUST WANTED TO SHARE BECAUSE WERE VERY SMALL CENTER WE SERVE PLASTER ELDORADO AND HELPING COUNTIES. WHICH IS FOUR THOUSAND SQUARE MILES OF SIERRA MOUNTAINS. AND SO WE HAVE CHALLENGES OF TRYING TO SERVE THE PEOPLE ACROSS THAT TERRITORY FROM OUR WHEN OFFICE IN AUBURN AND SO THESE FUNDS AND I HAVE. BEEN DIRECTED FOR US TO OPEN AN OFFICE IN PLACERVILLE SO THAT WE CAN SERVE THE RESIDENTS OF ELDORADO COUNTY AND ALPINE COUNTY. AND IT'S VERY CHALLENGING WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE COST OF HAVING STAFF TRAVEL AND MANY MILES ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS REIMBURSING THEIR MILEAGE AS WELL AS. THAT COST OF THEIR TIME. THE DIFFICULTIES OF TRAVEL WITH WHEN A WEATHER AND SO WE CANNOT EFFECTIVELY SERVE THEM FROM AUBURN AT WHICH IS WHY WE HAVE MADE IT A PRIORITY TO OPEN A SATELLITE OFFICE IN PLACERVILLE. SO I WANTED TO EXPLAIN WHAT WHAT THE FUNDS ARE BEING USED FOR AND AS WE GET THAT OFFICE A FULLY STAFFED AND UP AND RUNNING. THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT WE SERVE WILL INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY AND WE THINK IT WILL BE EQUAL TO THE NUMBER THAT WE CURRENTLY SERVE OUT OF OUR OFFICE IN AUBURN. THANK YOU THANK YOU.

AND WE ALSO REALLY WORK TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS. BOTH A LOT OF THE WORK THAT WE DO IS HELPING PEOPLE FIND HOUSING AND HELPING KEEP THEM FROM BEING A VICTIM ED AND BECOMING HOMELESS.

AND LASTLY YOU KNOW WE REALLY INDIVIDUALS WORK WITH A REPORT THAT THEY HAVE INCREASED QUALITY OF LIFE FROM OUR SERVICES. SO I WANTED TO MENTION THAT THE IDEA OF LOOKING AT OUR DATA AND DOING A STUDY ON HOW WE CAN REALLY BECOME AN INTEGRAL PART.

DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES AND I'M HERE WITH LANE THE FINE DEPUTY DIRECTOR AND CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR ON JOHN DOYLE. SO JUST GO TO PROVIDE. A HIGH LEVEL BECAUSE THE AGENDA DOES ADDRESS I'M THE REALLY CRITICAL POINTS THAT'S RE LATER TO THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER CLOSURES. BUT TO PROVIDE SOME. POOL UPDATED INFORMATION. THAT YOU MIGHT FIND HELPFUL BUT AS THE AGENDA DOES REFLECT. WE. ANNOUNCED AND MAY HAVE TWENTY FIFTEEN THE CLOSURE OF THREE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS CINEMA. PORTERVILLE. THOUGH GENTLE TREATMENT AREA PORTERVILLE AND. FAIRVIEW. AS OF. MAY TWENTY FIFTEEN OUR POPULATION FORECLOSURE WAS EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX TODAY WE HAVE A CURRENT POPULATION FOR INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE TRANSITIONING TO THE COMMUNITY. OF THREE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN. WE ARE PROTECTING AND GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THAT WE ARE GONNA BE REDUCING THAT POPULATION BY JUNE THIRTIETH FOR CURRENT YEAR. TO TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY AND THEN AT THE END OF JUNE THIRTIETH AND TWENTY NINETEEN. SEVENTY FOUR INDIVIDUALS. THAT SEVENTY FOUR INDIVIDUALS REFLECTS THAT FOR CINEMA DEVELOPMENT ALSO NOTE THAT THE LAST PERSON WOULD BE MOVING FROM CINEMA I'M PRIOR TO DECEMBER OF. THIS YEAR. ADDITIONALLY LIKE TO JUST SHARE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE. THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT FOR FEAR OF YOU IMPORT AVAIL SO WE HAVE A REQUIREMENT TO OBTAIN THE FEDERAL FUNDING TO MAINTAIN A POPULATION THAT IS CONTINUING TO DECLINE OF TRANSITIONING FOLKS TO THE COMMUNITY. AS OF JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY EIGHTEEN THERE AGREEMENT REFLECTS THAT WE SHOULD HAVE A POPULATION OF FIFTY SEVEN. WE CURRENTLY HAVE A POPULATION FOR THE INTERMEDIATE CARE FACILITY WHICH IS. FOR THE INDIVIDUALS THAT NEED A TRANSITION UNDER THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT. THAT WE ARE WE ARE CURRENTLY AT SIXTY SEVEN SO WE HAVE TEN MORE THAT WE NEED TO TRANSITION BY JUNE THIRTIETH. AND THEN FOR PORTED FILTHY AGREEMENT REFLECTS SIXTY ONE INDIVIDUALS ON THAT WE NEED TO BE BY JUNE THIRTIETH OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND WE'RE CURRENTLY AT FIFTY SEVEN SO WHERE. WE'VE ALREADY MANDATE FOR THIS CURRENT YEAR. AND ONE OF THE OTHER AREAS THAT'S OF PARTICULAR INTEREST FOR. SUPPORTING INDIVIDUALS TRANSITIONING TO THE COMMUNITY AS FOR MY YOUR STAFF. THE COMMITTEE STATE STOP PROGRAM HAS BEEN A VERY STE. IMPORTANT PROCESS THAT THE CLOSURE ON SO WE'RE CONTINUING TO SUPPORT THAT MAKING SURE THAT THE STAFF WERE FAMILIAR WITH WHAT THE OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE TO THEM. WE'VE INCREASED THE CONTRACTS AND WE'RE CONTINUING TO DO THAT A INTERVIEWS TO. TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE AVAILABLE TO THE SERVICE PROVIDERS TO CHOOSE TO SELECT UP TO SUPPORT THEM IN THE COMMUNITY. ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS WERE HAPPY TO ANSWER THANK YOU. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE OLEO ANY COMMENTS ON ISSUE ONE. SEEING NONE WILL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENTS ON. WE HAVE A REPRESENTATIVE FROM DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA YEAH I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR YOUR TESTIMONY BEFORE PUBLIC COM. GREAT THANK YOU SO MUCH SIR. UP SO DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA IS THE FEDERALLY MANDATED PROTECTION AND ADVOCACY AGENCY HERE CALIFORNIA WE ALSO HAVE THE OFFICE OF CLIENTS RIGHTS ADVOCACY WHICH IS THROUGH A STATE CONTRACT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES. AND I'M KATIE HORNBERGER NAM THE DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF CLIENTS RIGHTS ADVOCACY. ALSO I'M WE REALLY ARE VERY PLEASED WITH THE MOVEMENT THAT WE'VE BEEN SEEING. BY THE DEPARTMENT AND THE REGIONAL CENTERS AND MOVING PEOPLE OUT OF THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS. ON WE WERE ALSO A VERY PLEASED WHEN THE DEPARTMENT ISSUED ON THE SAFE TO SERVE REGULATIONS ON REGARDING THOSE INDIVIDUALS. ON THAT WOULD BE INVEST SECURE TREATMENT AREA AT PORTERVILLE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER. ON LARGELY THOSE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE CURRENTLY INCARCERATED. OF AND. NEED TO BE MOVED TO ANOTHER CITING FOR TREATMENT CLUB UNFORTUNATELY IN THE REGULATIONS ON WHICH INCLUDED A LOT OF ON TRANSPARENCY WHICH WAS IS. IT IS REALLY HELPFUL TO ALL OF US. OF. WHAT WE? ASCERTAIN THROUGH BREEDING THOSE IS THAT IT REALLY GUESTS THAT APARTMENT BETWEEN FIVE AND SIX MONTHS TO MAKE WHAT'S CONSIDERED A SAFE TO SERVE DETERMINATION. WHICH WOULD MEAN WHETHER OR NOT THE PERSON WOULD LEAVE THEIR CURRENT SETTING IN BE ADMITTED TO PORTER VELL DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER. ON IN AS A SAFE SAID MANY OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE CURRENTLY INCARCERATED. ON. WE BELIEVE THAT THAT TIME PERIOD IS WAY TOO LONG TO MAKE THAT DECISION AND WE WOULD ASK THAT THE DEPARTMENT MAKE THAT DETERMINATION. CALM WITHIN THIRTY DAYS WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH A LOT OF OTHER TIME LINES IN OUR SYSTEM AROUND COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENTS AND MAKING OTHER KINDS OF DETERMINATIONS. ON WE WOULD ALSO ASK THAT THE CLIENT'S RIGHTS ADVOCATES ON OUR NOTICED OF ALL OF THOSE DECISIONS. ON THE RECENT TEST TO SPEED UP THAT DETERMINATION IS THAT UNFORTUNATELY IF SOMEONE IS FOUND NOT SAFE TO SERVE. ON THE NEXT STEPS TO DEVELOPING AN APPROPRIATE PLACEMENT FOR THEM. ALL OFTEN. CAN BE VERY TIME CONSUMING AND SO IF WE'VE ALREADY HAD SOMEONE SITTING DOWN IN AN APPROPRIATE SETTING FOR FIVE TO SIX MONTHS WHEN WE BEGAN. TO INVESTIGATE WHAT OUR NEXT STEPS ARE THAT. DELAYS THE PROCESS SIGNIFICANTLY SO THE SOONER THAT ON THAT DETERMINATION CAN BE MADE THE SOONER THAT IF THAT PERSON IS DENIED ADMISSION WE CAN BEGIN DEVELOPING OUT ANOTHER PLAN FOR THEM. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I'M JUST ONE QUESTION BEFORE WE TAKE PUBLIC COMMENTED SEEMED LIKE YOU MENTIONED THIRTY DAYS RIGHT HERE AND YET IN OUR. AND THAT WE HAVE A TWENTY ONE DAY LIMIT SO WANTED TO CLARIFY WHICH WAS APPROPRIATE OR WHICH. WAS RIGHT AND SO ON IT YOU KNOW I'M I KNOW EARLY ON WE HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT A TWENTY ONE DAY TIME LIMIT. AND THEN ON IN REVIEWING OTHER STATUTE STATUTORY AND REGULATORY FORUMS THIRTY SEEMED UPON. BUT THE MOST OFTEN USED NUMBER ON FOR A LOT OF THINGS THAT COME IMPACT ON PEOPLE WHO MAY HAVE CHALLENGING BEHAVIORS OUR OTHER NEEDS THAT MAKE THEM MORE CHALLENGING TO SERVE. ON AND SO THOUGHT THAT NUMBER WAS MORE APPROPRIATE. WILL LAST FOR A RESPONSE BUT AFTER PUBLIC COMMENT IF WE CAN SO WE WILL NOW TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE ONE. SEEING NONE WE WILL BRING IT BACK UP TO THE DYESS AND NOW I WOULD HOPEFULLY HAVE THE DEPARTMENT RESPONDS TO. A WHAT WE COULD DO TO TRY TO MEET THE EXPECTATION OF THIRTY DAYS. SEEMS LIKE FIVE OR SIX MONTHS AS A WHILE BUT. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS JOHN DOYLE DTS ON WHAT WE APPRECIATE DRC'S CONCERNS ABOUT REGARDING THE LENGTH OF TIME IT COULD POTENTIALLY TAKE IT AND JUST TO BE CLEAR. FIVE OR SIX MONTHS IS NOT A TIME PERIOD THAT'S A LATIN STATUTE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. CURRENTLY IT TAKES ABOUT SEVENTY FOUR DAYS TO DO AN ASSESSMENT OF AN INDIVIDUAL PROPOSED TO BE COMMITTED TO PORTER BILL. SO IN THAT SEVENTY FOUR DAYS INCLUDES THE TIME THAT IT TAKES TO GET A COURT ORDER. TO VISIT THE INDIVIDUAL IN JAIL TO BEGIN THE ASSESSMENT PROCESS. AND RIGHT NOW WE'VE GOT. TWO HUNDRED ELEVEN BED SUPPORTER BILL CURRENTLY ABOUT TWO HUNDRED OF FULL. SO ON. AND WE'VE GOT A REFERRAL LIST OF NINE INDIVIDUAL SO. IT'S NOT AN ISSUE THAT WE DON'T HAVE SPACE TO PUT PEOPLE IT'S THE TIME THAT IT TAKES TO DO A THOROUGH ASSESSMENT. AND ONE OF THINGS I THINK WE WOULD ALSO ONE NOTE IS THAT FOR INDIVIDUALS. WHO POTENTIALLY COULD BE UNSAFE TO SERVE? YOU'RE WE WITH THEIR OTHER RISK FACTORS THAT WE LOOK AT SO WE WANNA KNOW. ON YOU DON'T IT DESERVES INDIVIDUALS BEHAVIORS. POSE A RISK TO THAT RESIDENTS OR THE STAFF AT PORTERVILLE. OWN ARE THERE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES THAT ARE PREDOMINANT IS THE INDIVIDUAL MORE APPROPRIATE PLACED IN A STATE HOSPITAL. ON. IS THE INDIVIDUAL ACTION RISK OF INJURY BECAUSE OF IT AT A PRE EXISTING MEDICAL CONDITIONS SO. AND THEN THERE ARE. THE OTHER THING I THINK WE ALSO NOTED SIT DOWN. THE CASESARE VERY COMPLEX AND THEY'RE USUALLY CONTRADICTORY ASSESSMENTS. ARM SO THAT THIRTY DAYS OFTEN ISN'T ENOUGH TIME TO MAKE A DETERMINATION WHETHER THE INDIVIDUAL OF SAFE TO SERVE. AND. YOU KNOW WE THE DEPARTMENT USES A PERSON CENTERED PLANNING PROCESS TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE ARE GETTING THE APPROPRIATE SERVICES AND SUPPORTS IT BUT ME. AND YOU KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THAT INDIVIDUAL IS ACTIVELY ENGAGE WITH THE REGIONAL CENTER. ALSO MAKES A DIFFERENCE AS FAR AS HOW QUICKLY DID SUSSMAN CAN BE DONE. AND I THINK FINALLY I WOULD NOTE THAT YOU KNOW SINCE TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN. WE'VE HAD ONE INDIVIDUAL WHERE WE HAD TO MAKE A DETERMINATION ON AND NOT SAFETY SERB ASSESSMENT SO. I WOULD I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT THE THERE'S NOT A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF CASES THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH. IS THERE ANYTHING ON THE STATE SIDE WE CAN DO TO HELP WITH WORKLOAD TO HELP LOWER SOME OF THAT TIME FRAME AND. WHAT WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE? SO AT THIS FANCY APARTMENT YOU KNOW AT THIS TIME I THINK THAT THE BEST THING THAT THAT WE CAN CERTAINLY DO IS JUST CONTINUE WITH OUR COMMITMENT OF MAKING SURE THIS AS. AYE MISTER DOYLE HAD INDICATED THAT WHILE THE FIVE AND SIX MONTHS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT IS IT'S NOT ROUTINE IT'S CERTAINLY NOT THERE. THE. STANDARD THAT WE WOULD LOOK TO DO AND SO WITHIN THE STAFF THAT WE HAVE IN OUR EXISTING RESOURCES THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO. MAKE SURE THAT IN EVERY INSTANCE THAT WEEKEND. MEET TIME LINES THAT ARE WITHIN OUR ABILITY BASED ON WHAT THE COURT DATES ARE BASED ON THE OTHER FACTORS THAT WE MAY NOT HAVE AS MUCH CONTROL LOVE. ON THAT WE'RE COMMITTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN GET FOLKS TO AMEND ASSESSMENT SO WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT THE. NEEDS OF THE INDIVIDUAL IS IDENTIFIED SO THE BEST SERVICES CAN BE DONE. SO THAT THE FIVE TO SIX MONTHS IS NOT IS IS NOT AN AREA IN WHICH WE'VE EVEN EXPERIENCED. NOR DO I ACTUALLY ANTICIPATE IT TAKING FIVE TO SIX MONTHS SO WITH OUR EXISTING RESOURCES WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE PRIORITIES TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE ASSESSED. SO THEY CAN REALLY GET TO THE BEST SERVICE OPTIONS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO THEM. WITHOUT ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS FOR MY COLLEAGUES. SEEING NONE WE WILL HOLD ISSUE ONE OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE TO. DOCTOR CHAIR MEMBERS AB AND SONY PREDICT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. YOU SHOULD ALL HAVE A HANDOUT RELATED TO ISSUE TO. ON SEQUESTERING SAVINGS WONDERFUL THANK YOU. AS NOTED IN THE AGENDA OUR OFFICE WAS ASKED TO ASSESS THROUGH SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT LANGUAGE. I THE PROPHETIC PROPOSAL TO TAKE THE POTENTIAL SAVINGS THAT COULD RESULT FROM THE CLOSURE OF DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS AND APPLYING IT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES COMMUNITY SERVICES PROGRAM. I WILL BRIEFLY WALK YOU THROUGH THE FINDINGS FROM. FROM OUR. EXAMINATION OF THIS ISSUE. IF YOU CAN TURN TO PAGE ONE OF THE HAND OUT THERE REALLY TWO POSSIBLE SOURCES OF SAVINGS AS GUY WHEN IT COMES TO THE CLOSURE OF DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS. ONE IS NET OPERATIONAL SAVINGS AND ON PAGE TWO WE'VE NOTED. REVENUES GENERATED FROM THE SALE REPURPOSE SING OF DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER PROPERTIES. I'M GOING TO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE THREE GOING TO WALK YOU THROUGH HOW WE CALCULATED NET OPERATIONAL SAVINGS. SENATE OPERATIONAL SAVINGS WILL RESULT IF THE COST TO SERVE INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY IS LESS THAN WHAT IT COSTS THE STATE TO SERVE INDIVIDUALS IN INSTITUTIONS. SO THE FIRST THING WE HAD TO DO WAS LOOK AT WILL WHAT DOES IT COST THIS STATE TO SERVE INDIVIDUALS IN INSTITUTIONS. SO. TO DO THIS WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE GYM STATE GENERAL FUND BECAUSE FIRST OF ALL WE CAN'T LOOK AT TOTAL FUNDS AND WE ALSO NEED TO LOOK AT THE COSTS OF THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS THAT ARE CLOSING SINCE. THERE ARE TWO FACILITIES THAT WILL REMAIN OPEN. SO WHEN WE A NARROW IT DOWN TO THIS IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN THE STATE SPENDING ABOUT TWO HUNDRED MILLION GENERAL FUND TO SERVE. INDIVIDUALS AT THE DC'S. THE NEXT THING SO THIS IS WHAT YOU CAN THINK OF IS THE AVOIDED COST ONCE THE DISEASE ARE CLOSED RELATIVE TO TODAY. THE SECOND THING WE NEED TO LOOK AT IS WHAT IS ACOSTA SERVE INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY. WE ESTIMATE THAT ONCE THE FINAL CLOSURES ARE CA ARE COMPLETE THE COST TO SERVE THE REMAINING ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY INDIVIDUALS WHO WILL HAVE MOVED FROM TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN THROUGH FINAL CLOSURES. WILL BE ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE MILLION ANNUALLY FROM THE GENERAL FUND THIS INCLUDES COST TO BOTH THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES AS WELL AS COSTS IN OTHER STATE PROGRAMS SUCH AS MEDICARE OF. FINALLY WE DO NEED TO LOOK AT THE GENERAL FUND BECAUSE TO PROVIDE SAFETY NET AND CRISIS SERVICES IN THE COMMUNITY. THESE OUR SERVICES THAT WERE FORMERLY FORMERLY PROVIDED AT FAIRVIEW IN CINEMA DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS ONCE THEY'RE CLOSED. THE DEPARTMENT IS WORKING TO BUILD UP A SYSTEM IN THE COMMUNITY TO PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES. WE PAID BACK COST ABOUT TWENTY FIVE MILLION GENERAL FUND ANNUALLY. AND THAT'S LIKELY THE LEAST THAT THE STATE WOULD SPEND. SO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE FOUR WE HAVE SORT OF A A BREAKDOWN. OF THE THE REDUCE COSTS AS WELL THERE ARE THE REDUCE SPENDING IT DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS AS WELL AS THE ESTIMATED COMMUNITY COSTS. WE ESTIMATE THAT THE MOST THE STATE COULD SAVE IN ANNUAL GENERAL FUND DOLLARS IS A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND THIS IS AFTER FINAL CLOSURES ARE COMPLETE. AND I WOULD MAKE. TWO IMPORTANT POINTS ABOUT THIS CALCULATION ONE IT DOESN'T FACTOR IN THE SORT OF DYNAMIC CHANGES BETWEEN NOW AND FINAL CLOSURE SO WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT THE REDUCED. COSTS AT DC'S BETWEEN NOW AND THEN BUT WE'RE ALSO NOT LOOKING AT THE SIGNIFICANT COSTS TO THE STATE TO DEVELOP NEW HOMES AND RESOURCES OUT MY COMMUNITY. WE'RE ALSO JUST NOTE. THAT THIS ESTIMATE IS HIGHLY VARIABLE. A HUNDRED MILLION IS REALLY THE MOST WE THINK THE STATE COULD SPEND THAT SAFE. NEXT IF YOU TURN TO PAGE FIVE I'LL JUST BRIEFLY WALK THROUGH A OPTIONS FOR RAISING REVENUES FROM THE SALE RE PURPOSING OF DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER PROPERTIES. WHEN IT COMES TO SELLING INDIVIDUAL PARCELS OUR ENTIRE DC PROPERTIES THERE ARE SOME BENEFITS TO THIS OPTION ONE IT WOULD REDUCE THE STATE'S LIABILITY AT THESE PROPERTIES. COULD ALSO GENERATE A ONE TIME INFLUX OF REVENUES THIS REVENUE CAN ALSO BE INVESTED TO GENERATE INTEREST WHICH WILL BE AN ONGOING SOURCE OF FUNDING. AND THERE ARE SOME CHALLENGES AND ISSUES TO CONSIDER WITH THIS OPTION HOWEVER AT EACH OF THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER PROPERTIES HAS UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT COULD AFFECT THE SALE POTENTIAL IN MARKET VALUE OF THE PROPERTY SO FOR EXAMPLE. THERE'S AGING INFRASTRUCTURE ITS NO MY. THE PORTERVILLE LOCATION IS FAIRLY REMOTE TO AN IS IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THIS YEAR SECURE TREATMENT PROGRAM. THERE ARE ALSO LOCAL PREFERENCES TO CONSIDER OTHER LOCAL ZONING ORDINANCES AS WELL AS. BOTH AT FAIRVIEW AT SORRY IN THE CITY OF COSTA MESA AND THEN ALSO. I WEAR CINEMA DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER IS LOCATED THERE VOTER APPROVAL REQUIREMENTS FOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS. WE ALSO DON'T KNOW THE CURRENT VALUE OF THE PROPERTIES AND THEN FINALLY I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT THE STATE IF IT WANTS TO GENERATE REVENUES FROM THE SALE OF DC PROPERTY SPECIFICALLY FOR THE DTS SYSTEM. AND IT WANTS TO MAXIMIZE THE SALE POTENTIAL IT MAY HAVE TO BYPASS THE TYPICAL STATE SURPLUS OF PROPERTY PROCESS THERE IS PRECEDENT FOR DOING THIS IS JUST AN ISSUE TO TO KEEP IN MIND. ANOTHER OPTION OF WHEN IT COMES TO DC PROPERTIES IS TO LEASE INDIVIDUAL PARCELS OF THE PROPERTY. THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS INCLUDE THIS COULD BE AN ONGOING SOURCE OF REVENUE I'D ALSO KEEPS THE PROPERTIES IN THE STATE'S HANDS IF IT. IF IT NEEDS NEEDS THOSE PROPERTIES FOR PRETEND OF FUTURE STATE USE. AND THERE ARE SOME CHALLENGES FOR ONE THE STATE IS NOT IN THE BUSINESS OF BEING A LANDLORD IT DOES NOT TYPICALLY LEASED PROPERTIES AND ACT AS A LANDLORD FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF RAISING REVENUES. AND AGAIN THE UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS OF EACH PROPERTY COULD AFFECT THE LEASING POTENTIAL. AND I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT ONE ONE OPTION FOR LEASING HOWEVER WHICH IS TO LEAST. INDIVIDUAL PARCELS TO DEVELOP AFFORDABLE HOUSING THERE'S PRECEDENT FOR DOING THIS AT THE FAIRVIEW DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER PROPERTY THERE'S CURRENTLY A HOUSING DEVELOPMENT AND ANOTHER ONE IN THE WORKS. I THIS COULD INCREASE THE SUPPLY OF HOUSING FOR BOTH DS CONSUMERS AS WELL AS OTHER CALIFORNIANS. THE SURPLUS RENTAL PROCEEDS COULD BE USED TO SUBSIDIZE THE WRENCH OF DC A DDS CONSUMERS. AND I WOULD JUST NOTE THE THE POTENTIAL CHALLENGES OF ASSOCIATED WITH THIS OPTION ON PAGE SEVEN. I'M AGAIN HAS TO DO WITH SOME OF THE UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS OF EACH DC PROPERTIES SO FOR EXAMPLE WOULD VOTERS. IN COSTA MESA APPROVE A THIRD HOUSING DEVELOPMENT PROJECT THAT'S UNKNOWN. EYES NOMO WE WOULD NOTE IS IN NOT CLOSE PER IS NOT IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE OTHER TYPES OF SERVICES AND SUPPORTS THAT DTS CONSUMERS WOULD NEED. FINALLY ON PAGE EIGHT I WOULD JUST NOTE A COUPLE OTHER ISSUES FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION. I'M ONE WE WOULD JUST NOTE THAT A LOT OF THE STATE BUDGET IS ALREADY WALKED IN AND EARMARKED FOR CERTAIN PURPOSES THIS WOULD BE ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF DOING THAT. OF COURSE THE LEGISLATURE COULD DECIDE TO SUSPEND THAT REQUIREMENT IF IT NEEDED THE FUNDS FOR ANOTHER PURPOSE. BUT WE'RE ALSO NOT THE LEGISLATURE ALWAYS HAS THE OPTION TO INCREASE SPENDING ON DDS BUT SERVICES. AND FINALLY WE WOULD JUST NOTE THAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD THINK ABOUT HOW TO EFFECTIVELY TARGET THE SAVINGS SO FOR PROPOSAL IT MAY WANT TO THINK ABOUT PARAMETERS FOR. THE SPECIAL FUNDS OF AND THAT IT WOULD LIKELY SET UP TO DEPOSIT THE SAVINGS INTO. AND WE WOULD ALSO RECOMMEND. CONSIDERING A COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT OF SERVICE GAPS IN THE DDS COMMUNITY SERVICES PROGRAM. AND JUST TO CONCLUDE IF THE LEGISLATURE DECIDES TO PURSUE THIS PROPOSAL THERE DEFINITELY OPPORTUNITIES FOR. A GENERATING SAVINGS FROM THE CLOSURE OF DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS AND THERE'S JUST A FEW IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES THAT MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER. GREAT THANK YOU THANK YOU. UP NEXT WE'LL HAVE SOME GLIMMER MATHIS. BUT HER. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I'M HERE TO EXPRESS MY SUPPORT OF THE LAND LETTERMAN'S COALITION BUDGET REQUEST. THE NEED FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS FOR PEOPLE WITH DEVELOP MENTAL DISABILITIES IS BOTH VITAL AND URGENT. IF YOU ARE AWARE THE THREE REMAINING DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS INCLUDING THE SECURE TREATMENT PROGRAM. AT PORT A BILL AND THE CANYON SPRINGS FACILITY WILL BE CLOSED BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AS SUCH WE MUST DECIDE WHAT HAPPENS TO THE MONIES SAVED FROM THE CLOSURES OF THESE FACILITIES. MORE IMPORTANTLY WE MUST DECIDE HOW TO ENSURE. THAT THE REMAINING FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN INDIVIDUALS. IN THE DE SEIZE ARE PROVIDED FOR AS THEY TRANSITION INTO THE COMMUNITY. I BELIEVE THAT THIS CONVERSATION MUST BEGIN WITH ENSURING AFFORDABLE HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES. THE LATTER MEN COALITION HAS PROPOSED THE CREATION OF THE. INTEGRATED COMMUNITY LIVING. FUND. WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES. THIS FUND WILL SERVE AS A. REPOSITORY. WHEN REVENUE IS GENERATED FROM NEW USES OF THE DC PROPERTIES. THE FUND WILL BE UTILIZED TO FINANCE CAPITAL COSTS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW HOUSING UNITS FOR REGIONAL CENTER. CLIENTS. AS YOU ARE AWARE. A PORTION OF THE SITE AT FAIRVIEW DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER. IS RUN AS HARBOR VILLAGE A MIXED RESIDENT COMMUNITY WHICH SERVES AS A MANDATED. PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. THE REMAINDER OF THE UNITS ARE LEAST TO THE PUBLIC AT MARKET RATES. THIS MODEL HAS GENERATED REVENUES FOR HARBOR VILLAGE. ULTIMATELY FUNNELS BACK INTO DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES TO INCREASE SERVICES FOR PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. THIS MODEL HAS PROVED EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE. I PROVIDING HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES FOR INDIVIDUALS TRANSFERRING. OUT OF THE STATE'S REMAINING DC'S AS WELL AS PROVIDING HOUSING OPTIONS FOR INDIVIDUALS ALREADY IN THE COMMUNITY. IN NEED OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHICH WE ARE TO HAVE AN ISSUE WITH IN OUR STATE. LAST FALL I VISITED THIS SITE PERSONALLY. I'VE SEEN HOW EFFECTIVE IT IS AT SERVING PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. IS MY GOAL TO SEE THIS STYLE OF INTEGRATED HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES. SPANNED THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WITHIN A MY DISTRICT THE CITY'S OF WHEN THE IMPORT OF BILL HAVE ALREADY EXPRESSED A STRONG DESIRE TO. CREATE THIS INTEGRATED HOUSING OPTION WITHIN THEIR COMMUNITIES. WITHOUT ACTION FROM THIS SUBCOMMITTEE ANY FUNDS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CLOSURE OF DC'S. AND THE SALE OR LEASE OF THE PROPERTY. WILL BE LOST TO THE GENERAL FUND. WE CANNOT ALLOW THESE FUNDS TO BE TAKEN AWAY FROM THIS COMMUNITY. AS A MEMBER OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE I AM EXTREMELY PROUD TO BE. IN SUPPORT OF THE LETTERMAN'S COALITION BUDGET REQUEST ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT AS WELL. WITH ME TODAY IS MISTER LINDSEY FROM ARC IN ALIGNMENT COALITION IS ALSO PROVIDES CONNECTS. THANK YOU. THANK MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. SOMEONE MATHIS FOR YOUR COMMITMENT TO THIS ISSUE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR YOUR GREAT ANALYSIS AND THE LA GO. ON THERE A THROUGH REPORT OF THIS ISSUE. A MISTER CHAIR I AM RIPPING THE LAYMAN COALITION WHICH CONSISTS OF MORE THAN TWENTY STATEWIDE ORGANIZATIONS INVOLVED IN THE ADVOCACY FOR THE DEVELOPER DISABILITY COMMUNITY. AND WHEN ALL OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS CONVENE DURING THE SUMMER TO DISCUSS WHAT WILL BE OUR PRIORITY FOR THIS YEAR. A WE COLLECTIVELY DECIDED THAT THE CLOSURE OF THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS PRESENTS AN IMPORTANT AND TIME SENSITIVE WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY. TO PRY IMPROVE THE LIVES OF PEOPLE. INTELLECTUAL DEVELOP THE DISABILITIES IN THE COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND WE DECIDED THAT OUR TOP PARTY THIS YEAR IS TO MAKE SURE THAT DOLLARS IN ASSETS THAT ARE USED TO SERVE PEOPLE WITH ID DE TODAY WILL CONTINUE TO SERVE PEOPLE ID DE TOMORROW. THERE ARE ESSENTIALLY TO POTENTIAL POTS OF MONEY AVAILABLE TODAY. AND THE REQUEST KNOWS TO BE USED TO CONTINUE TO BE STE TO SUPPORT THE COMMUNITY. FIRST PART OF MONEY OPERATING DOLLARS AND DC'S AS WE HEARD FROM ELIO. OTHER PROPOSALS ON THE AGENDA TODAY. AS WELL AS OTHER CRITICAL NEEDS WITHIN THE COMMUNITY BACK TO BE FUNDED THROUGH THE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR NET SAVINGS ONGOING. AND WE CAN. AND WE CAN SCORE THOSE SAVINGS TODAY TO FUND NEEDS AND THE COMMUNITY NOW. THE SECOND PART OF MONEY. IS ANYBODY THAT STATE RECEIVED FROM ASSETS THEMSELVES THE PROPERTIES AS ASSEMBLYMAN MATHIS JUST DESCRIBED. FOR MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YEARS COMBINED THESE ASSETS BEEN PART OF THAT YOU THE SYSTEM AND CALIFORNIA'S NOT UNIQUE MANY OTHER STATES AND HAD TO DEAL THE EXACT SAME OPTION. THEY HAVE THE SAME HISTORY AS OURS OF LARGE SITES INSTITUTIONS BEEN DEVELOPED AND WHAT DO THEY DO NOW NOW WE'RE CLOSING THEM THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. OTHER STATES HAVE DONE EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING TO DO TODAY. TO RETAIN THOSE MONIES TO BE USED FOR THE BENEFIT THE COMMUNITY. SO WHEN IS THE REQUEST THE REQUEST IS TO USE REVENUES IF WHEN THEY COME INTO THE STATE FROM THESE ASSETS CONTINUE TO BENEFIT CALIFORNIA'S WITH ID DE. THE FIRST NEED IDENTIFIED BY THE COALITION. IS THE NEED FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. SO WE PROPOSE TO CREATE NEW INTEGRATED COMMUNITY HOUSING UNITS THROUGHOUT THE STATE BY THE CREATION OF A FUND AT DTS AND MANAGED BY THE DEPARTMENT. OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. EIGHT CITY WOULD ADMINISTER THE FUN THE SAME WAY IT DOES MANY OTHER FUNDS BY SEEKING PROPOSALS FROM DEVELOPERS. OR NONPROFIT NONPROFIT HOUSING ORGANIZATIONS ETCETERA TO CREATE NEW UNITS SET ASIDE SPECIFICALLY FOR REGIONAL CENTER CLIENTS. THEY NEED FOR HOUSING THE COMMUNITY IS CRITICAL AND WE KNOW THIS. BECAUSE OF DISCRIMINATION AFFORDABILITY AND ACCESSIBILITY IT IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE PER PERSON WITH ID DE WITH AN S. SOCIETIES P. INCOME. TO FIND HOUSING RIGHT NOW IN CALIFORNIA THIS PROPOSAL WILL HELP IT WON'T SORTS ALL POLL THE PROBLEMS BUT WILL GET SOME PEOPLE INTO A SAFE AN INTEGRATED PLACE TO LIVE. THE ADDED BENEFIT OF HOUSING PROPOSALS LIKE THIS. IS THAT IT CREATES ADDITIONAL HOUSING SUPPLY THROUGHOUT THE STATE. ON AVERAGE THE STATE WOULD SPEND AND HOW SPENT ON PROGRAMS LIKE IT'S ABOUT SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR A NEW UNIT TO BE BUILT. WHEN ON AVERAGE ARE COSTING THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND ON THE MARKET BUILT. BUT IT IT IT ALSO LEVERAGES YOU THINK LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS TO BUILD AN ADDITIONAL FOUR OR FIVE FAIR MARKET PRICE HOUSING UNITS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND OTHER WORDS EVERY DOLLAR THE STATE PUTS INTO DEVELOPING HOUSING CREATES FOUR DOLLARS AND TWENTY FIVE CENTS. ADDITIONAL HOUSING DOLLARS TO CREATE UNION NEW UNITS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. ALSO REGARDING SONOMA DEVELOPMENTS DEVELOPMENT CENTER WE ARE WORKING WITH CENTER REQUIRES OFFICE TO RESOLVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE PROPOSAL BUT WE ARE OPTIMISTIC THAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THOSE CUTS CONCERNED SOON. AND QUICKLY WHAT THIS PROPOSAL IT IS NOT IT IT'S NOT. ASSEMBLY FOR PEOPLE COMING OUT THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS ONE MAKE THAT CLEAR THIS IS FOR ALL REGIONAL CENTER CLIENTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT ARE NEEDED FOR OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. ALSO WHILE WE. AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED THERE ARE MODELS ALREADY ABOUT BUILDING ON SITES AGAIN PROPOSALS NOT. DISCIPLINE NECESSARILY ONLY ABOUT DEVELOPING ON SITES THEIR NEEDS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THAT WE CAN ADDRESS WITH THIS. S. OF THE LIMON COLLISION RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT THE COMMITTEE SUPPORT THIS ONCE AND THEN IT'S GONE OPPORTUNITY TO TO FULFILL SOME OF THE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIANS WITH INTELLECTUAL DEVELOP DISABILITIES THINKING. NEXT WE HAVE A REPRESENTATIVE FROM SCO YOU. WE MAKE THIS SPACE FOR HER IF THAT'S POSSIBLE. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS AYE TIFFANY WHITE WITH THE SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION. I REQUEST HERE TODAY 䇶 YOU HAVE A HIGHLY CONSIDER THAT LEASING. PORTIONS OF THE PROPERTIES FROM THE DC CLOSURES OF OUR MEMBERS FIND A VITAL THAT THERE ARE THERE'S MULTIPLE SERVICES THAT ARE. A NEED WITHIN THE DD SYSTEM WE WOULD AGREE WITH THE LATTER AT COALITION THAT HOUSING IS THE IMMEDIATE NEED OUT BUT THAT SHOULDN'T LIMIT US FOR MAKING SURE THAT THE ENTIRE SYSTEM IS FUNDED ADEQUATELY. ARMS OUR REQUEST IS THAT THERE BE A SPECIAL FINE BECKONED ADDRESS THE HOUSING NEED BUT IN THE OUT YEARS BE ABLE TO HAVE SOME SUSTAINABLE ONGOING FINDING. TO ADDRESS OTHER CONCERNS ANOTHER NEEDS WITHIN THE DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES. SYSTEM WE THINK LEASING IS THE BEST OPTION BECAUSE IT DOES PROVIDE A SUSTAINABLE. ONGOING I'M FUNDING SOURCE AS OPPOSED TO SELLING WHICH YOU KIND OF JUST GET A SINGLE BANG FOR YOUR BUCK. OFTENTIMES UCF IN THIS COMMITTEE WERE COMING BACK TO ASK FOR DIFFERENT. SOURCES OF FUNDING FOR DIFFERENT SERVICES. AND WE TAP INTO THE GENERAL FUND QUITE OFTEN IF WERE ABLE TO HAVE A SPECIAL FUND THAT'S DEDICATED TO SERVICES THAT WE CAN KIND OF GET INTO THEN WE DON'T HAVE TO ALWAYS CONTINUOUSLY. TAP INTO THE GENERAL FUND I'M IN THE OUTGOING YEAR SO. I REQUEST THAT IF THE AYE YOU AGAIN WE'VE WE'VE HIGHLY AGREE WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER MATHIS AND WHAT THE LATIMER COALITION THAT THE IMMEDIATE NEED IS HOUSING BUT GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY AND I BELIEVE THE DEPARTMENT AND. THE STATE IS LOOKING INTO LEASING AS THE OPTION WE WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE YOU GUYS TO CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THAT AS A VIABLE OPTION AS IT DOES PROVIDE I'M ONGOING FUNDING FOR THE ENTIRE SYSTEM. AND WE ALL KNOW THAT THE SYSTEM IS IN DIRE NEED. OF LITTLE INDETERMINATE THIS TIME BECAUSE THE POPULATION THAT REMAINS IN THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS TEND TO BE THE HIGHEST NEED AND I SECURITY PATIENTS SO. IT'S A DIFFICULT COST COMPARISON WE CAN'T PASS TRANSITIONS I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO NOTE THAT THE POLICING OF THE REVENUE WOULD REQUIRE STATUTORY CHANGES. AND THAT BASED ON EXPERIENCE AT HARBOR VILLAGE WE DIDN'T REALIZE SIGNIFICANT GENERAL FUND. REVENUES UNTIL DECADES AFTER PROPOSAL WAS IMPLEMENTED SO WOULD LIKE TO CAUTION AGAINST. USING. REVENUES FROM THOSE PROPOSALS FOR ANY ONGOING FUNDING REQUESTS. THANK YOU SIR. NEXT TIME I'D LIKE TO HEAR FROM AT THE DEPARTMENT IF I CAN ABOUT WHAT THE LA COMMENTED ON. IF YOU'RE READY TO. DISCUSS OTHERWISE WE CAN TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT AND ASK QUESTIONS LATER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR ARM. YOU EARNS ABOUT THE COST OF SERVICES IN THE COMMUNITY AS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE POINTED OUT AS WELL. WE THINK THAT RATHER THAN SIXTY MILLION A YEAR TO SERVE PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY BASED ON. THE ESTIMATE PROCESS WE USE WE'RE LOOKING AT NUMBERS MORE LIKE EIGHTY FOUR MILLION. THANK YOU SIR. WITH THAT WE WILL NOW TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE TO. EVELYN I'M HOUSING DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S MULTIPLE PROPOSALS. I'M OUT HERE ON THE ISSUE OF THE DC PROCEEDS NO MATTER WHICH PROPOSALS ARE ADOPTED WE BELIEVE THAT THE DC PRESS IT SHOULD STAY IN THE SYSTEM. FOR PEOPLE FOR THE BENEFIT OF PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES WE ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE LOCAL COMPLEXITY THINGS TAKE COMPLEXITIES INVOLVED WITH THE WHOLE PROCESS OF WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH. THE DEPARTMENT THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE AS THE PROCESS MOVES FORWARD THINK YOU. THANK YOU MA'AM. CURRENT HOLDEN WITH EASTER SEAL CALIFORNIA I REMEMBER THE LETTERING COALITION AND AND IN SUPPORT PRIMARILY BECAUSE WE SERVE. PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES ON A DAILY BASIS AND THE MAJOR BARRIER TO GREATER LEVELS OF INDEPENDENCE FOR THOSE IN INDEPENDENT LIVING IN SUPPORT OF LIVING IS CLEARLY ACOSTA HOUSING. IS A MAJOR A. HOWEVER CRISIS LEVEL ALMOST BECAUSE IT'S THE PRIMARY BARRIER THAT'S KEEPING PEOPLE FROM OUR INDEPENDENT LIFE SO ANYTHING WE CAN DO. TO BE ABLE TO HAVE SOME DEDICATED FUNDING TO IT WOULD BE A GREAT RELIEF THANK YOU. ARGUMENT. DR ARAMBULA MEMBERS OF THE% COMMITTEE IT DISTINGUISHED STAFF A RICK ROLLINS REPS IN ARKANSAS SHE SHE REGIONAL CENTER AGENCIES WERE HERE TO EXPRESS OUR. SUPPORT FOR PRIORITIZING HOUSING AS A. THEM HUGE NEED IN OUR SYSTEM AYE AND WITH THE CLOSURE THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS AND MAINTAINING. THE BENEFIT OF THAT TO IN OUR SYSTEM THANK YOU BECAUSE. SHERMAN MEMBERS CARLIN AND I'M HALF THE ALLIANCE SPORTING. INDIVIDUALS WITH INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT DISABILITIES ALSO IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE. WHEN EMMA COALITION'S PROPOSAL AND I DO WANT TO NOTE THAT. THIS IS MISTER LINDSEY SAID YOU'VE GOT TO POTS THERE'S THE. PROPERTIES THEMSELVES THE ASSET OF THE PROPERTIES THERE SECONDLY THE OPERATIONS DOLLARS. WE THINK HELIOS DONE A GREAT JOB. WE MIGHT ARGUE THAT THEY WERE PERHAPS A BIT CONSERVATIVE EVEN BUT HAVE DONE A GREAT JOB. AT PULLING APART THE POSSIBILITY OF SAVINGS AND. WE'RE ASKING THAT THE LEGISLATURE BE VERY CREATIVE I'M LOOKING AT THIS BECAUSE IT IS AS MR LENSES AT A ONE TIME. OPPORTUNITY. THERE'S NO REASON WE COULDN'T FOR EXAMPLE EXTRAPOLATE IN THE FUTURE LOOK AT FUTURE SAVINGS. AND IN FACT SECURITIZED AGAIN SO SAVINGS. TO PROVIDE BENEFIT TODAY. YOU KNOW FIFTEEN YEARS FROM NOW WHEN THERE'S NO DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER WILL BE STILL BE SAVING A HUNDRED MILLION AND WHATEVER PLUS. THAT WE OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE SPENT HAD WE KEPT THE CENTERS OPEN. WHY NOT LEVERAGE AGAINST THAT MONEY JUST LIKE WE HAVE BEEN TOBACCO TAX SOLOMON'S ANOTHER FINANCIAL SCHEMES STAYS LOOK AT? TO EXPEDITE MONEY INTO THE SYSTEM TODAY BECAUSE THERE IS NO QUESTION. THAT THE SYSTEM IS NOT HOLDING TOGETHER UNDER THE RATE STRUCTURE THAT WE HAVE TODAY. SO IS A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO PRIDE LEADERSHIP NOT DO THINGS THE WAY WE'VE ALWAYS DONE IT BEFORE. ONE WE'VE CLOSED DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER AFTER DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER THERE'S BEEN ZERO BENEFIT TO THE COMMUNITY AND ON THE ISSUE OF ACUITY OF PERSONS WHO RESIDE THERE. I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT WHEN A FIRE GOES THROUGH A FACILITY LIKE A DOZEN CINEMA WE SUDDENLY EXPEDITE PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR WITHIN FIVE MINUTES. SO ACUITY OR NOT IF I WOULD LOOK AT THIS MORE FOR THE SYSTEM AS A FISCAL EMERGENCY. AND IT'S TIME TO RE REACTIVE TO THAT EMERGENCY TO TRY TO GET THE SYSTEM HEALTHY AND WHOLE SO THE PEOPLE THE COMMUTER GETTING HIGH QUALITY SERVICES. AND THE STATE IS USING ITS RESOURCES ADEQUATE IN THIS REGARD THANK YOU VERY MUCH THINK. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS ERIC RATHER THE STATE COUNCIL ON DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES THE STATE COUNCIL'S POSITION IS THAT THESE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS EXIST TO FOR THE CARE AND THE HOUSING. NAM OF INDIVIDUAL WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AND THEY'VE DONE THAT THE PAST IN THE SAME DOLLARS SHOULD BE COMMITTED GOING FORWARD BOTH OPERATIONAL DOLLARS AND FROM THE SALE OF THE ASSETS. AT THIS POINT STATE COUNCIL RIPPER UP SUPPORTS THE PROPOSAL FOR THE INTEGRATED COMMITTEE HOUSING FUND THANK YOU. HELLO MY NAME IS JACKIE DELUDE FOST WITH THE CALIFORNIA SUPPORTER LIVING NETWORK. OUR BOARD MET YESTERDAY THE NUMBER ONE PRIORITY FOR THE SUPPORTED LIVING NETWORK WHICH IS IN SUPPORTED LIVING INDEPENDENT LIVING ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING. WE CAN DO SUPPORT OF LIVING WE CANNOT DO IT IF WE HAVE NOWHERE SO FOR SOME OF THE LIVE AND WE HAVE NO DIRECT SUPPORT PROFESSIONALS. I'M AND I WANTED A DEPARTMENT FINANCE I TALKED ABOUT THE SEVERITY OF THE NEED IN THE COMMUNITY IN COMPARISON TO DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER. AGAIN THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE CONTINUE TO LIVE IN OUR COMMUNITY FIVE AND SEVENTY THREE MANY OF THOSE MY AGENCY FORTUNATELY FORTY FIVE PEOPLE HAVE TRANSITION OUT OF THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER. AND WHAT THEY'RE STRUGGLING WITH TODAY. IS HOUSING. A TWO BEDROOM TWO BATH IN SACRAMENTO IS FOURTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH. WE TALK ABOUT INDEPENDENT LIVING THERE IS NO SAFETY NET FOR SOMEONE WHO GETS FIFTEEN HOURS A MONTH OF SUPPORT THEY DON'T HAVE PLACES TO LIVE SOME OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD YOU WOULD NOT WANT YOUR FAMILY MEMBER TO LIVE UP. THAT'S THE SAFETY NET RIGHT NOW IS ON THE STREET WHERE DO THEY GO I DON'T KNOW. I JUST THINK WE HAVE TO RE LOOK AT OUR SYSTEM THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS ARE CLOSING I WAS READING THROUGH THE LA REPORT EIGHTEEN NINETY ONE. EIGHTEEN NINETY ONE THIS HOUSE PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES THEY LIVE THERE THEY DIED THERE IT'S TIME TO MAKE SURE THE PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY CAN LIVE AND THRIVE. SO WE NEED TO RE LOOK AT THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT THIS FUND WE NEED TO DO WHATEVER IS IN OUR POWER TO DO AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IT'S NOT JUST A HOMELESS PROBLEM IS NOT JUST OF THAT PROBLEM IT'S A DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES PROBLEM EVERYDAY PICK. JAMIE DAVIS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR MORE ADVENTURES AND SANDRA FELT TODAY PROGRAM. SERVING ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN PEOPLE. WE JUST INTEGRATED SIX PEOPLE FROM THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER ENTIRE DAY PROGRAM AND I CAN ASSURE YOU WE'RE NOT GETTING ONE PENNY MORE FOR THEM THAT WE GOT FOR THE OTHER PEOPLE. SO THEY'RE NOT COSTING MORE FOR THEIR DAY PROGRAM SERVICES. SO CONSIDERING THAT AN AVERAGE OF A MILLION DOLLARS PER PERSON IS GOING TO BE SPENT NEXT YEAR ON DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER. CLIENTS THAT LEAVES NINE HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR EACH OF THESE PEOPLE TO BE SUPPORTED IN THE COMMUNITY. I THINK THERE'S A DIFFERENCE. AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE HOUSING RATES ARE DON'T KNOW. THEY ALL LIVE IN ONE GROUP HOME DOWN THE STREET FROM OUR PROGRAM. BUT I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S THEIR SPENDING NINE HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER PERSON ON pBECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH IT DOESN'T MEAN WE CAN'T AGREE IN PRINCIPLE THAT IS A GOOD PLAN THANK YOU. I CAN. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN IS THE COMMITTEE PERRY GETTING WITH THE CALIFORNIA DISABILITY SERVICES ASSOCIATION I WANNA SIT REGISTER OUR SUPPORT FOR THE WHEN WE COALITION PROPOSAL CDSA IS A MEMBER OF THE LET ME COALITION. AS WELL I WANT TO SUPPORT THE THE IDEA THAT WE DO NEED TO CAPTURE THESE OPERATIONS DOLLARS I AGAIN I WANT TO COMPLIMENT THE LA A ON THE REPORT. I THINK SONNY DID A GREAT JOB AND REALLY WE'VE BEEN YIELDING SAVINGS FOR MANY YEARS AS A DEVELOPMENT OF CENTERS OF CLOSE DOWN THIS IS REALLY OUR LAST SHOT TO TRY TO CAPTURE SOME OF THESE DOLLARS WERE COMING AT YOU. WITH A LAST GASP PROPOSAL SAYING WE HAVE A BUNCH OF GAPS WE'VE A BUNCH OF NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY. AND THIS IS OUR LAST CHANCE TO REALLY COMMIT DOLLARS HAVE ALREADY GOING TO THIS POPULATION TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY STAY IN THE SYSTEM FUNDING PEOPLE AND COMMUNITY. THANK YOU PRODUCER. I AM TEMAS MET WITH STRATEGIES TO EMPOWER PEOPLE I'M I'M HERE IN SUPPORT OF. HAVING THE MONEY FOLLOW THE PEOPLE THAT IT SERVED IT REALLY DOES IT SERVED SO MANY PEOPLE THERE WHY SHOULD IT NOT CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THEM AS THEY MOVE OUT IN THE COMMUNITY AND LEAVE. LIVE INDEPENDENT LIVES. AND IT ALSO WILL BE SO MUCH EXTRA LEFT OVER TO HELP ADDITIONAL PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY LIVING ON THE COMMUNITY OR. AS I LIKE TO SAY I HAVE TWENTY PEOPLE LIVING AND NOT IDEAL SITUATIONS BECAUSE THERE IS NO HOUSING. THEY'RE LIVING WITH OTHER PEOPLE THAT THEY REALLY WOULD PREFER NOT TO BECAUSE THEY CAN'T FIND HOUSING OR BECAUSE ANYBODY LIVING OFF SSA SSI ONLY GETS UNDER NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH. NO RENT IN SACRAMENTO IS NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS. EVERYBODY JUST RAISE THE RENTS AGAIN FOR PEOPLE THAT WERE ON BUDGETS OR LOW INCOME HOUSING AND THEIR LOW INCOME HOUSING IS THAT. WILL YOU BEING NINE HUNDRED IT'S NINE HUNDRED NOW WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT TWELVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY DAYS. NOBODY WANTS TO TAKE IT THEY WANT THREE TIMES THE AMOUNT OF RENT IT'S HORRIBLE LET ALONE RDSP TURN OVER RATE BECAUSE OF THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING THEY CAN AFFORD TO WORK. WITH THE PEOPLE THAT WE SUPPORT AND THEY NEED QUALITY SUPPORT STAFF. IT'S ALL AROUND WE NEED MONEY TO FOLLOW THEM. THANK YOU I CAN. UNABLE COMMITTEE I'M MARGARET FIREMEN I'M THE CEO OF UCP OF THE NORTH BAY. THAT IS SO NO MY NAPA SOLANO COUNTY AND I DO OF A BIT OF THAT BECAUSE HE WORKED WITH THE UC P. ARC A COLLABORATION AS WELL AS LOCAL COMMITTEES DISABILITY COMMITTEES. UNIVERSALLY THE NUMBER ONE PROBLEM IN OUR SYSTEM IS AFFORDABLE HOUSING. I DO NOT RUN HOUSING SERVICES I BROWN AND EMPLOYMENT SERVICES BUT I CAN'T GET STAFF THEY HAVE NO PLACE TO LIVE AND THE FOLKS THAT I HAVE TRADITIONALLY SERVED ARE MOVING. INTO THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND HOMES AND FAMILIES ARE BEING BROKEN UP BECAUSE OF THE PROBLEM IN THE NORTH BAY THIS IT'S ONLY BEEN EXACERBATED BY THE FIRES THIS LAST YEAR. SO I REALLY WANT YOU TO CONSIDER THIS PROPOSAL VERY SERIOUSLY THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OTHER ITEMS IN THE LANTERN AND PROPOSAL NONE OF THEM ARE IS CRUCIAL IS THE HOUSING. KEEPING THE ASSETS OF THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS IN OUR SYSTEM IS ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL AT THIS TIME. THINK ACUMEN. WHATEVER WITH USERS EXPLORE TO A STAND AND SUPPORT OF THE POLICY DECISION YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE IT WAS PREDICTED A GREAT JOB OF TRYING TO DO ANALYSIS IS ON SOME REALLY COMPLEX ISSUES. LITERALLY POLICY. ARE THOSE ASSETS THAT WERE HOUSING FOR FOURTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE IN NINETEEN SEVENTY. GONNA BE FOURTEEN THOUSAND UNITS IN THE COMMUNITY WE HAVEN'T MADE THAT MANY IS PEOPLE OF CONVERTED OUT INTO THE COMMUNITY WE NEED THAT ASSET. WHERE MY LEAD ADVOCATES LOSS FOR SECTION EIGHT HOUSING? WAS GIVEN TWELVE MONTHS NOTICE IT TOOK US FIFTEEN MONTHS TO FIND HER A PLACE IN A NEIGHBORHOOD THAT NONE OF US WOULD WANT TO LIVE. SHE'S HAD MULTIPLE BREAK INS MULTIPLE ISSUES IT'S NOT SAFE THAT'S WHERE FOLKS ARE HAVING TO LIVE IS A CRITICAL ISSUE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR. HI MY NAME'S PATTY DIXON I'M HERE AS AN EMPLOYEE FOR OVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS WITH FOLKS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. AS WELL AS A PARENT. AND. HOUSING IS A HUGE CRISIS IT'S IT'S CRITICAL AGAIN THEY'RE ASKING FOR THREE TIMES THE INCOME IN ORDER TO RENT A PLACE. WHICH ARE FOLKS DON'T HAVE. AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS A HUGE ISSUE AND NOT ONLY FOR. THE FOLKS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES BUT ALSO THEIR STAFF. BECAUSE OF COURSE THERE ISN'T IN THE BUDGET MONEY TO PAY THEM A LIVING. GOOD WAGE SO I SUPPORT ALIGNMENT COALITIONS PROPOSAL THANK YOU. THANK YOU MA'AM. PHOENIX CALIFORNIA DISABILITY RIGHTS WHERE WE'RE IN SUPPORT OF LETTERMAN COALITION. AND DOM PROPOSAL WANNA THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO SEE IF THAT NANA YES THE HOUSING. COSTS TO BE AFFORDABLE BUT HAS TO BE ACCESSIBLE. A NEW DTS PROGRAM UNDERSTANDS THIS THEY KNOW THAT WHEN THEY BUILT THESE DOMINICAN HAVE UNITS THESE HOUSES WILL BE ACCESSIBLE PICKING USM. RIGHT NOW IF YOU GET A HOUSE DON'T TWENTY SEVEN PERCENT OF ALL HOUSING IT'S ACCESSIBLE IN THIS STATE THAT'S THE LAW. BUT WITH THE DDS POPE BOZELL HERE W. LOT MORE ACCESSIBLE HOUSING AND A BILL TO MOVE RIGHT IN RIGHT AWAY AND THAT IS WHAT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT IN ORDER TO LIVE INDEPENDENTLY THEY GOT TO BE ABLE TO LIVE. INDEPENDENTLY. AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE IN SUPPORT OF THIS PROPOSAL. IF MILLER REPRESENTING THE LOS ANGELES COALITION OF SERVICE PROVIDERS. VERY STRONGLY SUPPORT. AT THAT THE POLICY THAT THE TAX DOLLARS THAT WERE. DEVOTED TO SERVICES FOR PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES REMAIN PURPOSED IN THAT DIRECTION. TRUTHFULLY BUT THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS HAVE BEING HAVE BEEN. DEPOPULATED OVER THIRTY YEARS MOST OF THE PEOPLE. I WHO HAVE COME OUT OF THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS OVER THE LAST THIRTY YEARS ARE BEING SERVED BY COMMUNITY SERVICE PROVIDERS. I EVERY YEAR WHEN WE COME AND WE ASK FOR A FEW A FEW CRUMBS FEW EXTRA DOLLARS. THE QUESTION THAT WE ALWAYS HEAR IS WHAT WHERE WILL THOSE DOLLARS COME FROM. HERE WE'RE LOOKING AT THE REALITY OF RESOURCES THAT CALIFORNIA HAS DEVOTED TO THIS POPULATION. AND THAT IS WHERE THE RESOURCES SHOULD COME FROM. WE SHOULDN'T BE LOOKING AT. ACTUALLY CAN SCRIPTING. CALIFORNIA'S RESOURCES FOR THE DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED. BY. LETTING THEM PERVERTED THE GENERAL FUND WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT THAT AS THE POOL OF RESOURCES. THAT THE THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND PLUS PEOPLE NEED. AND BY RE PURPOSING THOSE DOLLARS. SAVE THAT QUESTION OF WHERE WILL THE MONEY COME FROM THIS IS A SOURCE THAT CONSERVE THE COMMUNITY FOR MANY YEARS. WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE LIMIT COALITION. THANK YOU SIR. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS MICHAEL LONG TO HELP OF MINOR CASE OF SERENA PAULSON AND ACCORDING TO IF THAT'S THE BILL IN ITS. AND HOUSING IS ONE IN THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS FOR HER HUTS. AND THE REASON WHY IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT GIVES US OPPORTUNITY TO. BEEN ABLE TO LIVE. IN THE COMMUNITY. YOU KNOW JACQUI WERE SAYING THAT THE RAMP MUCH FOURTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS THERE'S ANOTHER PROBLEM. I'M FACING PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES LIKE MARCEL. AND THEIR IDEAS SHE GOT TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THREE TIMES AS MUCH AS THE INCOME. TO BE ABLE TO QUALIFY IN THIS SITUATION. OF BEING ABLE TO LIVE IN A COMMUNITY. SO I STRONGLY SUGGESTS TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE HOUSE SCENE. ON PROPOSAL THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON LYNN DEPLORED WITH THE VERY INK IN. NAPA. SOLANO CINEMA AND LAKE COUNTIES AFFILIATED WITH THE ARK CALIFORNIA AND ALSO WITH CALIFORNIA SUPPORTED LIVING NETWORK. I AM VERY EXCITED TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION TODAY'S BEEN A CONVERSATION THAT'S BEEN THE REGIONAL CENTER SYSTEM IN IN THE THIS FIELD OF SERVICES FOR MANY MANY YEARS. WAS REGIONAL CENTER EMPLOYEE MANY YEARS AGO. WE ALWAYS WANTED THE MONEY TO FOLLOW THE PERSON WHEN THE INDIVIDUAL LEFT THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER WHY WASN'T THE MONEY FOLLOWING THE PERSON THAT MADE NO SENSE. WE'RE UNDERFUNDED IN THE COMMUNITY. NOW IS A PROVIDER OF SERVICE I SEE IT I SEE IT EVERY SINGLE DAY THE STRUGGLE THAT WE FACE WITH HOUSING. IT'S INCREDIBLY CHALLENGING. IT WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO LIVE IN THE HOME THAT THEY CHOOSE. YET THERE ARE SO MANY LIMITATIONS LIKE THE GENTLEMAN BEFORE ME SPOKE. THREE TIMES THE RENT IS REQUIRED IF THEY DON'T HAVE THE FAMILY MEMBER WHO WANTS TO SIGN ALONG WITH THEM. THEY DON'T GET THE HOUSING. THERE ARE LIMITATIONS WITH REGIONAL CENTER ASSISTANCE OF COURSE WITH YOU WITH THE RENTING. SO THEY'RE LEFT TO LIVE WITH TWO OTHER PEOPLE THEY MAY NOT WANT TO BE LIVING WITH. I AM IN FULL SUPPORT OF THE LETTERMAN PROPOSAL AND. I AM HOPING THAT WE HAVE COME TO THE REALIZATION THAT THE MONEY NEEDS TO ACTUALLY FOLLOW THE PERSON SO THAT THEY CAN LIVE. INDEPENDENTLY LIKE YOU OR I WOULD WANT TO WITHIN THE COMMUNITY THANK YOU. THANK YOU MA'AM. I AM WHEN HYTNER AND I'M FROM STRATEGIES TO EMPOWER PEOPLE THAT'S A SUPPORTED LIVING IN AN INDEPENDENT LIVING. AGENCY HERE IN SACRAMENTO. I LET'S BE FRANK YOU HAVE MY FULL SUPPORT FOR THE WOMEN COALITION PROPOSAL. EVERY YEAR FOR DECADES I'VE BEEN HERE AT THE CAPITOL. TELLING YOU ABOUT WHY YOU NEED TO CLOSE THE DC'S AND THAT THE PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN THE DISEASE CAN BE. SAFELY AND WONDERFULLY SUPPORTED. OUT IN THE COMMUNITY. AND EVERY DAY AND I'M NOT EXAGGERATING I GET A NEW REFERRAL. AT THE AGENCY AND I HAVE TO PUT THEM ON A VERY LONG WAITING LIST. AND EVERY OTHER AGENCY IN TOWN IS IT DOESN'T ISN'T TAKING REFERRALS AND THE BIG PROBLEM IS THERE'S KNOW HOUSING FOR PEOPLE THAT THEY CAN AFFORD. AND THERE'S NO STAFF. TO SUPPORT THEM. THOSE TWO THINGS GO HAND IN HAND THIS IS A SOLUTION THAT WILL ADDRESS AT LEAST SOME OF IT. PART OF IT A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. THANK YOU HEGUMEN. LIKE MANY MEMBERS MIGHT AGAIN MY NAME IS RON HAY LONG AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR CREEL COMMITTEE RESOURCES FOR INDEPENDENT. LIVING AND ALSO A MEMBER OF THE LATTER MIKKOLA XIN WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF A LATIN COALITION ON. WE JUST TO LET YOU KNOW I HEARD A TWO BEDROOM FOR FOURTEEN HUNDRED AND STOCKTON AREA. IN HAYWARD IT'S ONE BEDROOM AT SIXTEEN HUNDRED. AND SO IT'S NOT ONLY HAS TO BE AFFORDABLE AND ACCESSIBLE BUT ALSO SUBSIDIZE. AND SO FOR PEOPLE TO LIVE IN OUR AREA WE HAVE TO MAKE IT WE HAVE TO MAKE IT WORK. AND AGAIN I BELIEVE IN SUSTAINABILITY OF THIS AND FULLY SUPPORT BOTTOM COALITION. EVERYONE GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS SARAH ONE. I HAVE A HOUSE PAYMENT IS ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED HOURS A MONTH EXPERT WITH MY ROOMMATE AND CUT THE HOUSE AND HOW. BUT IF I HAVE TO WE. OR I'M LEFT WITH NOTHING. SO I SAY IN IN THE SAFE HOUSE. AND I PAY I'M PAY HALF AND HALF IT'S OKAY I CAN AFFORD IT. BUT IF YOU GUYS CUT THE HOUSING WHERE AM I SUPPOSED TO GO. YOU THOUGHT I WANT TO STAY IN MY HOUSE FOREVER. SO IF YOU CUT IT. AND THEN I HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE HOSPITAL OR. DOES NOT HAVE TO DO IT THINK YOU. THANK YOU SIR. ANY FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE TO. SEEING NONE I'LL BRING IT BACK TO THE DYESS FRONT QUESTIONS WE MAY HAVE GOT ONE MORE. OKAY YEAH YES MA'AM. MY NAME IS. I THINK. MY NAME IS RENEE FORWARD AND I HAVE A DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY AND I'M BEING SUPPORTED IN THE COMMUNITY. BY THIS STEP AGENCY. AND YOU REALLY DO NEED TO LOOK AT HOUSING THE ONLY REASON I HAVE A HOUSE I CAN AFFORD. IS THAT THE OWNERS OF THE HOUSE HAD. DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED. BROTHER AND SISTER WHO LIVED IN THE HOUSE SO THEY'RE KEEPING THE HOUSE OPEN. FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. IF THEY WEREN'T. I COULDN'T AFFORD THE RENT IN THE AREA THAT I LIVE IN. AND IT'S FUNNY WE'VE BEEN GETTING PHONE CALLS FROM MILITARES CONSTANTLY GOING WOULD YOU LIKE TO PUT YOUR HOUSE ON THE MARKET. SO I KNOW MY LANDLORD THE OWNER IS MAKING GREAT SACRIFICE. BY. LETTING US LIVE THERE AT A LITTLE RANT. IT IS TRUE THAT IF YOU'RE DISABLED AND YOU WANT TO LIVE INDEPENDENTLY. YOU CAN'T FIND HOUSING. THE SO ISUPPORT THE LANHAM ACT AS FAR AS IT GOES THE OTHER THING IS SHE SHOULD. DEVELOP A POT OF MONEY FOR. PAYING STOCK. BECAUSE RIGHT NOW IF THEY LEFT US THEY COULD. MAKE MORE MONEY. AT TARGET OR WALMART OR AND. A LOT OF DIFFERENT PLACES. SO. SOMETIMES THEY LEAVE BECAUSE THIS SACK CAN'T LIVE ON WHAT I'M MAKING I LOVE YOU I LOVE THE WORK BUT I CAN'T LIVE ON. WHAT I'M MAKING AND SO THIS IS NOT GOOD? THE OTHER THING IS BECAUSE. THE REST OF FOR ORDINARY PEOPLE. YOU'VE ALL IS ACCEPTED THAT THIS COST OF LIVING IN CALIFORNIA IS REALLY HIGH. THE MINIMUM WAGE IS GOING TO GO UP TO FIFTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR. AND THAT WILL MEAN TO MY AGENCY WHERE THEY'VE WORKERS ARE LUCKY IF THEY GET UP TO FIFTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR THE AFTER WORK THERE FOR YEARS TO DO THAT. THEN THEY'LL BE PAID AT THE TOP RATE FOR ALL THEIR EXPERIENCE DEDICATION HARD WORK AND THE FACT THAT THEY'VE MOVED UP. IN THE CARE GIVING SKILLED. AND THEN THE NEW PEOPLE JUST OFF THE STREET WHO NEED TO BE TRAINED FOR EVERYTHING. STILL GET THE SAME WAGE. THIS IS NOT A PRACTICAL OUTCOME. PEOPLE WILL JUST DESSERT ALL THE AGENCIES AND I UNDERSTAND THAT A LOT OF THE SMALLER AGENCIES IF I WANTED TO MOVE OUT TO THE COUNTRY. MY FAMILY SAYS I SHOULD. BUT IF I MOVED OUT THERE I'M. THE SMALLER AGENCIES HAVE GONE OUT OF BUSINESS. AND THERE COUNTIES. DON'T HAVE THE SERVICES THAT SACRAMENTO COUNTY HAS. THEY ALL LIVE UP IN OUR BRING CALIFORNIAN RIGHT NOW I CAN'T THINK OF THE NAME OF THE COUNTY THAT I'M SURE SOME OF YOU KNOW IT. AND THEY JUST DON'T HAVE THE AVAILABILITY OF THE SERVICES. BUT IF YOU CAN'T. SHE'S RIGHT ABOUT ALL THE PEOPLE WAITING FOR HOUSES. IT'S PROBABLY NOT ALSO OUR AGENCY BUT OTHER AGENCIES BUT THEY'VE QUIT TAKING REFERRALS BECAUSE THEY CAN'T HIRE STAFF. AND I CAN'T FIND HOUSING. SO. YEAH. ó ALSO BROUGHT WRITTEN COMMENTS FROM PRISTINE GOAL. JUDGES GREAT YOU GIVE IT TO THE SERGEANTS WE CAN. DISTRIBUTOR. YEAH. THANK YOU MAY. THINK YOU. SO WITH THAT. BRINGING HIM BACK TO THE DYESS CAN I WANTED TO ALSO THANK SONYA PREDICATE THE LA O. FOR. COMPLETING THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE IT WAS A QUESTION WE HAD LAST YEAR. IN ON PAGE FIFTEEN OF THE ELLIOT REPORT THAT YOU HAD. SORRY AGNESE CAME WITH A HANDOUT. IT HAD TALKED ABOUT HOW. THE. REGIONAL CENTER STRUGGLE TO HELP CONSUMERS FIND CERTAIN SERVICES SUCH AS AFFORDABLE ACCESSIBLE AND SAFE HOUSING AS WE'VE HEARD FROM MANY IN TESTIMONY TODAY. BUT ALSO REGULAR DENTAL CARE EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND TRANSPORTATION ND SO I WANTED TO GET A SENSE FROM THE DEPARTMENT. WHAT TYPE OF COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT OF SERVICE GAPS ARE WE DOING RIGHT NOW? TO RELATE THIS UNMET. FUNDING REQUIREMENTS IN THE COMMUNITY SERVICE SYSTEM. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR YOU KNOW ONGOING ASSESSMENT AND DISCUSSIONS AS FAR AS WHAT THE NEEDS ARE IS IS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO DO AND THE CURRENT AVENUES THAT WE'RE USING. WE HAVE THE DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES TASK FORCE THAT WAS ESTABLISHED BY SECRETARY DULY WORKING WITH THE COMMUNITY TO UNDERSTAND WHERE THOSE SERVICE GAPS ARE. NOT ONLY FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH THAT ARE MOVING FROM DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS OR HAVING THE NEEDS WITH VERY KIND OF COMPLEX NEEDS BECAUSE CERTAINLY A LOT OF FOCUS HAS BEEN THERE. BUT UNDERSTANDING WHERE SOME OF THE OTHER SERVICE GAPS ARE HAVING SMALLER WORK GROUPS TO WORK THROUGH SOME OF THE DETAIL REGARDING SOME OF THE HOUSING ISSUES. SO THAT SCENARIO IN WHICH HAD HAS HELPED INFORM US AS A DEPARTMENT ON SOME OF SERVICE GAPS THE OTHER AREAS THAT WE TAKE A LOOK AT IS THE OPPORTUNITY THAT WE HAVE WITH A COMMUNITY PLACEMENT PLAN. THIS LAST YEAR WE'VE HAD AND. APPROVAL THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS TO BE ABLE TO USE A COMMUNITY RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT FUND. AS A FOLLOW UP FROM COMMITTEE PLACEMENT PLAN BECAUSE WHERE. I'M DEVELOPED REALLY PRIMARILY ALL THE RESOURCES FOR FOLKS WHO ARE MOVING FROM THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER SO NOW FOCUSING ON INDIVIDUALS ON AND THE NEEDS WITHIN THE COMMUNITY. AND I MENTION THAT BECAUSE PART OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GUIDELINES ONE IS WE HAVE TO REACH OUT TO. ON THE STAKEHOLDERS FOR INPUT AND WANT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE WELL WHAT ARE THE PRIORITIES THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT. TO PRIORITIZE THE USE OF THE FUNDS. TO DEVELOP THE COMMUNITY RESOURCES IN DEVELOPING THE GUIDELINES AND MEETING WITH STAKEHOLDERS ONE OF THE AREAS THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IS HOW DO WE REALLY GET A SENSE OF WHAT THE NEEDS ARE. SO CERTAINLY WITH CPP DOLLARS WE ARE ABLE TO LOOK AT HOW MANY INDIVIDUALS WERE IN A DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER WHAT. YOU KNOW WHAT ARE THE NEEDS AND BEING ABLE TO DEVELOPED BUT IT'S NOT AS DEFINED WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. YOU KNOW JUST DISTRICT JUST DISTRIBUTE DISTRIBUTING THAT. THE RESOURCES UNDER THE COMMUNITY RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT FUNDS SO IN THE GUIDELINES WERE GOING TO ASK TO REGIONAL CENTERS TO CEMENT TO US NOT ONLY THE DATA. THAT WOULD SUPPORT THE PROPOSALS THAT ARE WITHIN THAT. THE SUBMISSIONS THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE RECEIVING BUT ALSO COMMUNITY INPUT TO START IDENTIFYING WHERE THOSE GAPS OF SERVICES SO WE CAN REALLY LINK THOSE TWO. ALSO A RESEARCH TEAM IS AN AREA IN AND IDENTIFY MORE WHERE HE TRENDS AS WE'RE LOOKING AT TRENDS IN OUR CHANGES OF THE. A COMMUNITY WHERE THOSE NEEDS GOING TO BE EMERGING OVER TIME HOW MANY INDIVIDUALS ARE GRADUATING HIGH SCHOOL HOW MANY INDIVIDUALS ARE GOING AND WE'RE SEEING AN AGING POPULATION. SO'S WE WE CAN'T LOOK AT ONE SIZE FITS ALL AS FAR AS THE INFORMATION THAT'S COMING TO US WE REALLY DO HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK AT. KIND OF THE UNIVERSE AND AND GATHERING THAT INPUT TO HELP INFORM THE SOME OF THOSE AREAS OF GAPS OF SERVICES WELL AS THE TASK FORCE IS COMING TO SOME CONCLUSIONS I HOPE YOU WOULD INCLUDE THE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE SURE WE HAD. THE APPROPRIATE INFORMATION IN FRONT OF US MAY BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE UPDATES THANK YOU. WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE TO OPEN AT THIS TIME AND FOR PROCEDURAL PURPOSES WE WILL MOVE ON TO ISSUE FOR SINCE WE HAVE ASSEMBLYMEMBER OLD. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. TRADE. EVEN ALLAH CHO ON HERE UP IN JUST UP TO THAT YOU KNOW. THE CHAIRPERSON HAD TO GO TO ANOTHER MEETING SOMEBODY STANDING IN FOR. OKAY. CLOSE GOING TO THINK THE THE CHAIR AND I'LL THINK IT'S HERE. THROUGH. OUR ILLUSTRIOUS A COLLEAGUE. OF FOUR IS A CONSIDERATION AND ALLOWING US TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY PRESENT ON THIS PARTICULAR ITEM. MEMBERS SAID I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT. A TODAY MY REQUEST TO THIS COMMITTEE. THIS TO RECOGNIZE THAT WHILE IT MAY BE DIFFICULT TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE SERVICES ANYWHERE IN OUR STATE. WITH THE CURRENT RATE STRUCTURE. IT IS VERIFIABLY IMPOSSIBLE TO DO SO IN AREAS OF OUR STATE THAT ARE AMONG THE MOST EXPENSIVE PLACES TO LIVE. IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY. I ENCOURAGE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE TO RECOGNIZE THE VERY SIMPLE TRUTH ACOSTA OPERATE ANY BUSINESS ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE LABOR MARKET IN WHICH THEY OPERATE. WE SIMPLY CANNOT EXPECT A SERVICE PROVIDER IN SAN DIEGO SAN FRANCISCO OR PASADENA FUNCTION WITH THE SAME REIMBURSEMENTS THAT THE STATE PAYS. AND LOWER COSTS AREAS OF OUR STATE. WE KNOW PROVIDERS ARE STRUGGLING AND FAILING AND TO KEEP UP IN HIGH COST REGION'S. AS THEY STRUGGLE OR CLOSE IT IS THE PEOPLE DEPENDING UPON THEM WHO WILL SUFFER. GRANTING THIS REQUEST FOR TARGETED BRIDGE FUNDING WILL PREVENT THESE. ORGANIZATIONS TO CONTINUE SERVING THE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIANS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES WHILE WE WAIT. FOR THE COMPREHENSIVE RATE REFORM EXPECTED IN THE COMING YEARS. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE. AND WILL TURN THE REST OF MY TIME OVER TO GEORGE STEVENS AND MARC KLAAS. FIRST ONE EXPRESSED BY SINCERE APPRECIATION TO THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY. SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOLDINGS BUDGET REQUEST. THE TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN ANNUAL BRIDGE FUNDING IS DESPERATELY NEEDED BY SERVICE PROVIDERS STATEWIDE ESPECIALLY THOSE IN HIGH COST AREAS. ULTIMATELY THESE DOLLARS TO SUPPORT A THREE YEAR THOUSAND CONSUMERS INDIVIDUALS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DIABILITIES THAT LIVE IN COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. MY NAME'S GEORGE STEVENS AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE NORTH LOS ANGELES COUNTY REGIONAL CENTER. I'M ALSO THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA CONFERENCE REGIONAL CENTER DIRECTORS AND THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY DIRECTORS GROUP. THE HOSTAGES COUNTY REGIONAL CENTER SERVES TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED THIRTY NINE CONSUMERS. WHERE CURRENTLY PROVIDING INTAKE ASSESSMENT SERVICES SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY ONE INFANTS CHILDREN AND ADULTS? THE SOONERS THE THIRD LARGEST REGIONAL CENTER IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ONE OF THE FASTEST GROWING RULING OVER ONE THOUSAND NEW CONSUMERS EVERY YEAR. HAS SEARCHED NEED FOR VIABLE IN EXPANDING SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM IS UNQUESTIONABLE AND NECESSARY TO FILL THE STATE'S OBLIGATION UNDER THE LANHAM ACT. I'M ME HALF THE SENATE BORDER DIRECTORS THE COMMUNITY THE CENTER SERVES CENTER SERVICE PROVIDERS I'M VOICE IN OUR COLLECTIVE SUPPORT FOR ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOLDS TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR BUDGET REQUEST. THE IRAQIS WERE WE FIND THE VALUES IN THE MISSION OF THE STATE SET FORTH IN PROVIDING COMMUNITY SERVICES FOR CONSUMERS AND THEIR FAMILIES. THE ACT STATES APART LEGISLATURE FINDS THAT THE MERE EXISTENCE. OR DELIVERY OF SERVICES AND SUPPORT IS IN ITSELF INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE A PROGRAM EFFECTIVENESS TO ME PROGRAM MEANS THE COMMUNITY SERVICE AS A WHOLE. MOREOVER LETTERMAN ACT GOES ON TO STATE THAT AND I'M PARAPHRASING THE SERVICES SHOULD BE AVAILABLE STATEWIDE TO PROMOTE OPPORTUNITIES FOR CONSUMERS. TO BE INTEGRATED INTO THE MAINSTREAM OF LIFE IN THEIR HOME COMMUNITIES. FOR VARIOUS FINANCIAL REASONS BUSINESS COSTS AND RATES WERE NOT ABLE TO ENSURE THAT THE SERVICES AND SUPPORTS AUTHORIZED AN INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS AYE PPVS ARE AVAILABLE STATEWIDE EFFECTIVE OR EMPOWER CONSUMERS AS ENVISIONED LAMBERT. THIS IS DEMONSTRATED IN PART BY THE TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY NINE PROGRAM CLOSE THE LOAN WITHIN THE NORTH OF THINGS COMING REGIONAL CENTER SERVICE HEARING OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. IN ADDITION NORTH LA HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO EXPAND NEEDED SERVICES BECAUSE I REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS TO DEVELOP NEW SERVICES HAVE GONE UNANSWERED. THE PRIMARY CAUSES TO THE DISCONNECT BETWEEN ALLOWABLE RATES AND COST TO CONDUCT BUSINESS. TING PLYWOOD FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL MANDATES PROVIDERS HAVE INCURRED UNAVOIDABLE BUSINESS BECAUSE THEY MAKE IT INCREASINGLY POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO EFFECTIVELY SERVE AND SUPPORT CONSUMERS. COST PRESSURES SUCH AS THE MANDATE TO PROVIDE HEALTH INSURANCE PROTECT PERSONAL HEALTH INFORMATION. AND COST OF HIGH TECH PAIN ESCALATING WORKER'S COMP INSURANCE A SIMILAR FINANCIAL AUDITS AND PAYING REQUIRED LOCAL WAGES. OTHER COST DRIVERS OR RENT TRANSPORTATION EMPLOYMENT COSTS DUE TO HIGH TURNOVER. REGIONAL CENTERS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO INCREASE RATES DUE TO A STATUTORY RATE FREEZE AND MEDIUM RATES REQUIRING WORKS HOW SORRY ABOUT THAT. AND MEDIA RATE SETTING REQUIREMENTS WORKS WITH THE PRESS. PRESS NEW EMPLOYER RATES AS COSTS IN HAWKEYES HIGH COST AREAS. I CAN NOT SOME KIND OF WAY. WELL YOU GOT IT. WITH UP TO THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS MORE CONSUMERS WILL BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY PROGRAM CLOSURES. AND NORTH PHILLY OVER TWENTY ONE HUNDRED CONSUMERS HAVE BEEN DISPLACED. BY PROVIDERS WHO HAVE CLOSER DISCONTINUED SERVICES. JUST THIS LAST WEEK TO MORE PROVIDERS THAT GAVE NOTICE THAT THEY PLANNED CLOSE CITING RATES ARE TOO LOW TO SUSTAIN THEIR BUSINESSES. AS A CONSEQUENCE MORE CONSEQUENCE WHERE CONSUMERS WILL BE DISPLACED EMPLOYEES WILL LOSE JOBS. VACANCIES TURNOVER RATES ARE ALSO SEVERE SO SEVERE THAT CONSUMERS ARE TURNED AWAY ON FROM THERE DON'T THEY SERVICES DUE TO INSUFFICIENT STAFF TO MEET REQUIRED. CONSUMER STAFF RATIOS AS SUCH CONSUMERS ABSENT FROM PAID EMPLOYMENT AND RISK LOSING THEIR JOBS. REALLY START PROVIDERS I'M NOT ABLE TO HIRE THE RENT AND RETAIN THE APPROPRIATE CLINICAL STAFF TO SERVE INFANTS AND TODDLERS CONSISTENT WITH THEIR INDIVIDUAL FAMILY SERVICE PLANS. PROVIDE AN ALTERNATIVE SUPPORTS THAT CONSUMERS. WHO HAVE BEEN DISPLACED WERE WHO'VE PROVIDERS OF CLOSE BUSINESS ARE COSTLY AND ARE NOT LIKELY TO MEET THEIR BY PP OBJECTIVES AS ENVISIONED? WE FIND OURSELVES IN MANY REGIONAL CENTER SERVICE COORDINATORS SPENDING DAYS SEARCHING FOR ATTORNEYS AND COBBLING TOGETHER A PATCHWORK OF COSTLY SUPPORTS MEANT TO REPLCE CAUGHT THE LOST OF THE MOST APPROPRIATE SERVICES. HUMAN COST IN THE SITUATIONS CANNOT BE MEASURED ESPECIALLY THE LOSS OF TRUSTING RELATIONSHIP. IN CLOSING. WHAT IS TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS MEAN TO THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND CONSUMERS WE SERVE? UNSUPPORTED DAILY IN MEANS THE WORLD TO THEM. IT'S A NOMINAL COST THE PAVE TO ENSURE EACH CONSUMER CONTINUES TO HAVE A PRODUCTIVE AND MEANINGFUL LIFE. ASK ANOTHER WAY CAN CALIFORNIA FOR TWENTY THREE CENTS A DAY PER CONSUMER TO INSURE THEIR WELLBEING AND THE CONTINUITY OF THEIR SERVICES AND SUPPORTS. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK FOR TODAY AND IN SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOLDS TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR BUDGET REQUEST. THANK YOU. LIKE YOU COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS MARK CLAUS I'M THE PRESIDENT AND CEO FOR HOME OF GUIDING HANDS HOME GRADING HANDS IS LOCATED IN SAN DIEGO. WE HAVE BEEN PROVIDING SERVICES TO INDIVIDUALS WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES SINCE NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN SO WE WE'VE BEEN AROUND FOR A FEW YEARS. CELEBRATE OUR FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY. LAST YEAR. THE VAST MAJORITY OF. THE SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE ARE ARE FUNDED THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES OR MEDI CAL WE HAVE SOME. INTERMEDIATE CARE FACILITY HOMES. WHEN I SAY ALMOST ALL. TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE LAST YEAR WE'VE RAISED OVER TWO MILLION DOLLARS A TO FUNDS SERVICES DUE TO THE INADEQUATE RATES. THIS YEAR WE HAVE RAISED FOUR MILLION DOLLARS AND WE KNOW I THINK WE'RE AT THAT FOR A KIND OUR PERSPECTIVE. UP TO KEEP GOING BACK TO OUR COMMUNITY TO TRY THE FUND SERVICES. IT IT'S BECOMING MORE DIFFICULT AND IT'S IT'S ACTUALLY A BAD BUSINESS MODEL. I AM ALSO A BOARD MEMBER THE SAN DIEGO REGIONAL CENTER REPRESENTING THE FENDERS AND SAN DIEGO AND IMPERIAL COUNTIES AND ANDMAYBE MOST IMPORTANTLY. THE GRANDFATHER OF A YOUNG MAN WHO IS RECEIVE SERVICES. THROUGH THE EARLY START PROGRAM IN THE REGIONAL CENTERS OF. I'M HERE TODAY AS WELL ASKING IF YOUR FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOLDEN'S TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR REQUEST FOR BRIDGE FUNDING. FROM THE PARDON OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES. TO BEGIN OF FISCAL YEAR TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN BEGINNING JULY FIRST. THE REQUESTED APPROPRIATIONS AS GEORGE MENTIONED WOULD ALLOW FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF SUMMARY RATE RELIEF ON AT NUMEROUS COST PRESSURES. FACING PROVIDERS THEIR STRUGGLING TO KEEP THE DOORS OPEN. AND CONTINUING OF THE SERVICES TO PROVIDE GOOD QUALITY SERVICES THESE FUNDS WILL HELP PRESERVE ESSENTIAL SERVICES MAY TAKE OVER LOVE RELATIONSHIPS. THAT SERVICE PROVIDERS HAVE WITH THE INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES THEY SERVE. AND IN DOING SO PREVENT THE STATE FROM HAVING TO LOOK AT FUNDING ALTERNATIVE SERVICES THAT TYPICALLY REQUESTED REQUIRES SIGNIFICANTLY MORE INVESTMENT. IT IS GEORGE MENTIONED A ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOLDINGS OFFICE. DID A SURVEY OF PROVIDERS WITH OVER A HUNDRED PARTICIPANTS FORTY SEVEN PERCENT OF THOSE COMMUNITY AGENCIES THAT RESPONDED. REPORTED DOWNSIZING PROGRAM CAPACITY. OR CLOSING. LOOKING AT CLOSING PROGRAMS DUE TO INADEQUATE FUNDING OF. AS A RESULT OF INADEQUATE FUNDING INDIVIDUALS ARE MOVING LOSING SERVICES. AND. THEN A WEEK WE CAN'T WAIT FOR THE RATE STUDY I HEAR A LOT OF YOU KNOW A LOT OF LEGISLATORS LOT OF MY COLLEAGUES AND WILL pGREAT STUDIES COMING OUT IN THE ALL. MARCH OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN SUCH A LITTLE BIT TOO LATE TO GET INTO NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET. AND WE ARE IN CRISIS TODAY. THE BOTTOM LINE REALLY IS THAT THIS ISN'T ABOUT MY ORGANIZATION THIS ISN'T ABOUT HOME OF HEIGHT GUIDING HANDS ARE THE MANY PROVIDERS THAT ARE WOEFULLY UNEXPECTED. WITH EXCEPTIONAL DIRECT CARE STAFF THAT ARE PLAYED. INADEQUATE WAGES THIS IS ABOUT THE PEOPLE THIS IS ABOUT PEOPLE THAT WE SERVE. THIS IS ABOUT YOUNG MAN. NAME TERRY TERRY HAS LIVED WITH US. SINCE NINETEEN SINCE AUGUST FIRST OF NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN HE SO HE'S RESIDE IN ONE OF OUR HOMES. FOR FIFTY YEARS HIS FATHER WAS ONE OF THE FOUNDERS. IT'S ABOUT RJ RJ SEE YOUNG MAN HE SEVENTEEN. HE'S ONE OF THE EIGHTEEN CHILDREN THAT WE SUPPORT AND FOR COMMUNITY CARE LICENSE HOMES A FOR CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS WITH SUMS SEVERE BEHAVIORAL CHALLENGES. THAT'S BEEN IDENTIFIED FROM MY UNDERSTANDING IS WHAT HIGHEST NEEDS OF OF THE REGIONAL CENTER SYSTEM AND EDS. BUT HONESTLY I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG OUR ORGANIZATION CAN CONTINUE TO OPERATE THESE HOMES. THESE FOUR HOMES A EIGHT MONTHS INTO THE YEAR. WERE LOSING THREE HUNDRED AND NINETY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THESE FOUR HOMES SO LET'S OVER YOU KNOW FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS A DAY. JUSTIN OUT SOMEWHERE BETWEEN A THOUSAND FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS A DAY. WITHOUT SOME IMMEDIATE RELIEF THERE REALLY ARE NO OPTIONS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE OTHER THAN HIGHER COSTS OPTIONS FOR SOMEONE LIKE TERRY FOR SOMEBODY LIKE ARCHERY. THIS IS WHAT KEEPS ME UP AT NIGHT THIS IS WHAT KEEPS ME GOING AT THE OFFICE AT FOUR AM THIS IS WHAT GETS ME ON THE SIX THAT TWENTY FLIGHT OUT OF SACRAMENTO IN THE EIGHT TEND TO GO BACK. IT REALLY IS ABOUT THE PEOPLE THAT WE SUPPORT IT'S NOT ABOUT PROVIDERS IT'S NOT ABOUT THE REGIONAL CENTERS. IT'S ABOUT THE PEOPLE THAT COUNT ON US EVERYDAY. SO I'M ASKING FOR YOUR SUPPORT. SUPPORT YOUR COLLEAGUES. ASSEMBLYMEMBER'S ALL ASSEMBLY MEMBERS AND SENATORS. SUPPORT BRIDGE FUNDING REQUEST THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOLDEN HAS PUT OUT THERE FOR TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I THINK YOU CAN THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. AND THINK YOU TO SOME WOMEN HOLDEN FOR HIS INCREDIBLE. A COMMITMENT TO THIS ISSUE IT AND CHAMPION THIS CAUSE. JORDAN LINDSAY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE ARK IN UNITED THROUGH PULLED THE CALIFORNIA COLLABORATIVE AND. WATER AND THERE ARE MANY. PROPOSALS IN HERE AND I'M JUST GONNA SPEAK BECAUSE MANY PARENTS BECAUSE THEY'RE SPECIFICALLY TO A MINIMUM WAGE. AND THAT WE JUST HEARD FROM SO MANY A COUPLE PEOPLE ABOUT THE NEED FOR HOW HOW DIRECT SUPPORT PATCH PROFESSIONALS CAN GO GET A HIGHER PAYING JOB TARGET OR DOING SOMETHING ELSE OTHER THAN SUPPORTING. THEN INDIVIDUALS AND WITH WHAT THEY LOVE TO DO AND THEY'RE VERY GOOD AT IT IS A SKILLED NEED. SO IT'S INCREDIBLY PORTENT THAT THEIR. THAT THE WAGES REFLECT THAT. IN THE OPEN MARKET IF COSTS GO UP OR MINIMUM WAGE GOES UP FOR A TARGET THAN THEY CAN RAISE THEIR PRICES TO COMPENSATE IF THEY MUST. FOR PROVIDERS IN THE COMMUNITY IT IS A STATE RIGHT ACROSS THE TABLE ACROSS THE STATE. AND AS SOME WOMEN HOLDEN. SO PERFECTLY OUTLINED ITS IT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL FOR THE STATE'S JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. AND. WE HAVE HEARD THAT'S IS IN THE CP I GOES UP AS MINIMUM WAGE GOES UP AND I WANT IT THAT IN THE RATES OF STAY THE SAME. IT'S BECAUSE PROGRAMS TO CLOSE INCREDIBLE PRESSURES AND I JUST WANT SPEAK REAL SPECIFICALLY TO ONE ISSUE WHICH WAS BOTTOM OUTLINED VERY WELL ON THE AGENDA BUT JUST TO ADD TO IT. THAT THE DOUBLE WHAMMY THAT IS HITTING PROVIDERS IN THE CERTAIN REGIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. IN THAT NOT ONLY ARE THERE COSTS HIGHER BECAUSE THE MINIMUM WAGE. BUT IT IN AND THE REIMBURSEMENT RATES. IS AT THIS. IT'S LOWER THAN LET'S SAY SOMEBODY IN BAKERSFIELD FOR SOME AN ALLEY. AS THE STATEMENT WAGE HAS JUST INCREASE IN ON THE BOOKS WE HAVE THE ABILITY. TO INCREASE. PROVIDER RATES BASED ON THE STATE MINIMUM WAGE. THAT PROVIDER BAKERSFIELD OR MODESTO AS IN THE AGENDA JUST GOT THAT BOMB. THE PROVIDER IN LA DID NOT GET THAT BUMP THE PROVIDER IN BAKERSFIELD JUST GOT SO IT'S A DOUBLE WHAMMY FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS NOT ONLY TO HAVE HIGHER COSTS ARE ALSO NOT EVEN GETTING THE REIMBURSEMENT INCREASE REIMBURSEMENT. THAT THOSE IN OTHER PARTS THE STATE HAVE RECEIVED. IN AND SO WE ARE DEAFENING SUPPORT OF US WOMEN HOLDINGS REQUEST. AND. IT AND WHAT WE WHAT WE HAVE SAID ABOUT THIS DEBATE AROUND THE LOCAL MINIMUM WAGES THAT WE HATE HATE HATE THAT WE ARE HERE. ARGUING ABOUT MINIMUM WAGE. WE WISH WE ARGUE ABOUT SOMETHING SO MUCH MORE THAN THAT RIGHT NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MINIMUM WAGE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS AMY WESTLING I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE ASSOCIATION OF REGIONAL CENTER AGENCIES ALSO KNOWN AS OUR CAB WE REPRESENT ALL TWENTY ONE OF THE STATE'S REGIONAL CENTERS. AND FIRST AND FOREMOST I WANT TO THANK THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR HEARING THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE TODAY THANK YOU CHAIR WONDERFUL STAFFER AGENDA USING IT AND. BRINGING UP BEFORE YOU THANK YOU ALSO TO MISTER HOLDEN FOR CONTINUING TO SUPPORT OUR COMMUNITY AND CONTINUING TO PUSH THIS ISSUE BECAUSE IT IS VITAL. THE ASSOCIATION OF REGIONAL CENTER AGENCIES IS GRATEFUL THAT THROUGH A. B. X. TWO ONE THERE WAS FUNDING SET ASIDE TO DO A COMPREHENSIVE RATE STUDY IN OUR SYSTEM. OUR RATE SYSTEM IS BROKEN AND THERE IS AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF THAT I OFTENTIMES SAY THAT IT WANTS STARTED OFF LOOKING SORT OF LIKE A THREE BEDROOM TWO BATH HOUSE. IT WAS CUTE AND FUNCTIONAL AND NOW IT LOOKS MORE LIKE THE WINCHESTER MYSTERY HOUSE AS WE'VE ADDED ON OUT OF NECESSITY. AND WE APPRECIATE THE THOROUGH AND TRANSPARENT PROCESS THAT THE DEPARTMENT AND THEIR CONTRACTOR BURNT ASSOCIATES IS GOING THROUGH TO UPDATE THE RATES. BUT IN THE MEANTIME WE HAVE A CRISIS TODAY AS MISTER CLAUS NOTED. THE RATE STUDY IS DUE OUT A. BY MARCH OF TWENTY NINETEEN BUT TODAY WE'RE CONTINUING TO SEE PROVIDER STRUGGLE PARTICULARLY IN HIGH COST AREAS OF THE STATE. AND SO WE APPRECIATE MISTER HOLDEN'S REQUEST FOR THIS BRIDGE FUNDING WHICH REALLY IS A BRIDGE BETWEEN NOW AND THE RELEASE OF THE RATE STUDY AND RATE REFORM. INTO A SYSTEM THAT MAKES MORE SENSE AND IS BASED AGAIN ON REAL COSTS FOR THIS PROVISION OF SERVICES. AS MR STEVENS AND MR KRAUSS NOTED IT'S NOT ABOUT REGIONAL CENTERS IT'S NOT ABOUT SERVICE PROVIDERS IT'S ABOUT ENSURING. THAT THE LETTERMAN ACT. IS A REALITY FOR PEOPLE AND THE WAY THAT WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT IS BY ENSURING THAT THEY HAVE ADEQUATE SERVICE PROVIDERS TO MEET THEIR NEEDS. AND THIS IS A BUSINESS WHERE. IT IS ALL ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS IT IS ALL ABOUT THAT PERFECT MATCH BETWEEN THAT ONE INDIVIDUAL AND THEIR SERVICE PROVIDER AND SO IS SERVED SERVICE PROVIDERS BEGINNING TO. DECLINING ADMISSIONS OR NEED TO CUT BACK ON SERVICES OR CLOSE THEIR DOORS. THAT CAUSES DISRUPTION IN REAL PEOPLE'S LIVES AND THESE PEOPLE ARE COUNTING ON US TO ENSURE THAT THOSE PERFECT MATCHES REMAIN AND THAT THEIR SERVICES AREN'T SOMETHING THAT WE JUST COBBLE TOGETHER. BUT REALLY ARE HELPING THEM TO ACHIEVE THEIR STATED GOALS AND DREAMS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MA'AM. NEXT WE HAVE VERY GIARDINI WITH CALIFORNIA DISABILITY SERVICE ASSOCIATION FOLLOWED BY CATHERINE BLAKE MARK. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE VERY JEDINI CALIFORNIA DISABILITY SERVICES ASSOCIATION. AND I THINK I'M A LOT OF A LOT MY TESTIMONY ON OUR OUR FOUR PERCENT RATE INCREASE IT COULD BE STOLEN JUST FROM WHAT WE'VE HEARD ON A ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOLDING I WANNA. JUST FIRST EXPRESS MY GRATITUDE ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOLDEN FOR KEEPING THE ISSUE I WANT STRONG SUPPORT HIS TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR BRIDGE FUNDING REQUEST FOR THOSE HIGH COST AREAS. BUT WE WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT WE ARE IN A IN A REAL CRISIS AS A AS A SYSTEM AS AS WE'VE HEARD. AND SO WHAT WHAT CITIES IS PROPOSING IS AND REQUESTING IS A FOUR PERCENT INCREASE IN RATES AGAIN UNTIL WE GET. TO THE POINT WHERE THAT RATES THAT WE'VE HEARD ABOUT IS IMPLEMENTED. AND THE REASON IS THAT YOU KNOW YOU MIGHT WANT TO ASK HER WE GET FOUR PERCENT WILL THAT TRACKS YOU KNOW THE CPI INCREASE SINCE WE GOT OUR LAST INCREASE WITH THE VX TWO ONE FUNDING. AND I WANT TO GO BACK JUST A LITTLE BIT ON THE HISTORY OF RATE INCREASES PRIOR TO A. B. X. TWO ONE AND TWENTY SIXTEEN THE SYSTEM HAD RECEIVED ANY INCREASE AS A AS RATES SINCE TWO THOUSAND SIX. SO WE WERE LOOKING AT A TWENTY PERCENT RAISE OUR INCREASE IN CPI DURING TWO FROM TWO THOUSAND SIX TO TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN WE DID GET THE A B. X. TWO ONE FUNDING. AND THE X. TWO ONE FUNDING WAS CERTAINLY IT AN ABSOLUTE NECESSARY THING BUT PREDOMINATELY IT WAS FOCUSED ON A WAGE AND BENEFIT PASSED THROUGH FOR DIRECT SERVICE PROFESSIONALS. I THINK ALL THE PROVIDERS IN THE ROOM WOULD PROBABLY TELL YOU THAT'S THAT'S REALLY WHERE A LOT OF THE MONEY NEEDED TO GO BUT IT DID LEAVE A LOT OF GAPS UNADDRESSED A A LOT OF COSTA PROVIDERS JUST TO RUN THE SERVICE DID NOT GET. ACCURATE ARE YOU KNOW COMMENSURATE INCREASES TO KEEP THEM KEEP THE BUSINESSES FUND FUNCTIONAL. SO WE'RE AT A POINT WHERE WE'RE SEEING PROVIDERS. WHO WHO CANNOT DELIVER SERVICES THAT THEY WANT TO DELIVER IN THERE DEVELOPING INTERNAL WEIGHTLESS REGARDING HEARD SOME TESTIMONY ABOUT THAT? AND SO WE'RE REALLY AT A POINT WHERE WE DO NEED SOME SORT OF TEMPORARY STABILIZATION UNTIL WE CAN GET ACROSS THE FINISH LINE WITH THE RATE STUDY. THAT'S REALLY WHAT THE FOUR PERCENT ABOUT IN THE OTHER THE OTHER PIECE OF THE REQUEST IS REALLY TO ELIMINATE THOSE MEDIAN RATE CAPS WHICH WAS SUPPRESSING A SERVICES KEEPING NEW PROVIDERS OUT OF A SERVICES. THAT THAT DON'T ALLOW REGIONAL CENTERS TO NEGOTIATE WITH PROVIDERS TO INCREASE RATES SO ULTIMATELY THEY HAVE TO CLOSE PROGRAMS. AND I I THINK WE HEARD MISTER STEVENS VETOED AND WE SPOKE A LITTLE BIT AS WELL AT THAT MEETING RATE CAPS ARE REALLY KILLERS ON KEEPING SERVICES AVAILABLE TO THE CONSUMERS WHO RELY ON THEM. WE DID AT AN INFORMAL INTERNAL SURVEY WITH CDSA MEMBERS WE HAVE ROUGHLY OVER EIGHTY MEMBERS OF THE CDSA TWENTY THREE OF OUR MEMBER ORGANIZATIONS RESPONDED TO THE SURVEY. AS ONE TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF AN IDEA IT'S IT'S OBVIOUSLY NOT ASSEMBLY REPRESENTATIVE BUT IT GIVES YOU A FLAVOR OF WHAT WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH. YOU KNOW THOSE TWENTY THREE ORGANIZATIONS OPERATE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE PROGRAMS FORTY TWO OF THOSE PROGRAMS HAVE WAIT LISTS TODAY. WE ARE WE HAVE THE LANHAM ACT WILL NOT POST THAT WE LISTEN CALIFORNIA BUT IN REALITY WE DO BECAUSE WE HAVE SERVICES THE PEOPLE WANT. THAT WE JUST CANNOT PROVIDE BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ADEQUATE STAFFING DUE TO THE LOW RATES. AUTHOR OVER A THIRD OF THOSE PROGRAMS HAVE REDUCE CLIENTS IN THE LAST YEAR BECAUSE OF THE STAFF SHORTAGE SO THEY'VE REDUCED THE NUMBER SERVICES AVAILABLE. FOR THOSE ORGANIZATIONS HAVE CLOSE PROGRAMS ENTIRELY DUE TO STAFF SHORTAGE OR RATE INADEQUACY SO WE'VE GOT WE'VE GOT SOME VERIFIABLE PROBLEMS I THINK PART OF THE PROBLEM WE DON'T HAVE A REALLY GOOD DATA SYSTEM. IN TERMS OF PROGRAM CLOSE AND OVER THERE THAT ARC HAS DONE A SURVEY THE REGIONAL CENTERS TO DETERMINE HOW MANY PROGRAMS HAVE CLOSE BUT I DO THINK IF IF YOU REALLY TOOK A GOOD SNAPSHOT OF THE COMMUNITY YOU WILL SEE A COMMUNITY IN CRISIS AT THIS POINT. AND AGAIN. WE YOU KNOW WE ARE AT A POINT WHERE WE ARE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING NOT NOT FOREVER BUT THEIR POINT WHERE WE CAN JUST KEEP OURSELVES AFLOAT. UNTIL THE NEW RATES COME IN THROUGH THE RATE STUDY WE THINK THE SAVINGS FROM THE CLOSING THE DC THE MOST PERFECT OUTLINED IN THE LA OVER PORT COULD HELP BACKFILL SOME OF THIS. WE KNOW IT'S A SIGNIFICANT ASK BUT WE ALSO THINK IT'S AN UPSWING NECESSARY ACTS SO THAT WE CAN DELIVER ON THE PROMISE OF THAT LIMON ACT. SO WE DON'T LEAVE PEOPLE SITTING AT HOME WITHOUT SERVICES NOT GETTING YOU KNOW NOT LIVING FULFILLING LIVES THAT'S THAT'S NOT WHO WE ARE AS CALIFORNIA THAT'S NOT WHAT WE SHOULD ASPIRE TO BE. AND WE WOULD LIKE YOUR SUPPORT IN MAKING SURE THAT THAT'S NOT WHO WE. THINK IS. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ABOUT A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT ISSUE ARM AND FOR YOUR ONGOING INTEREST AND COMMITMENT TO THE ISSUES FACED IN THE SYSTEM BOTH MISTER HOLDEN AND ALL OF THE MEMBERS OF THE OF THE COMMITTEE. I WANNA TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT INDIVIDUALS WHO LIVE IN VERY RESTRICTIVE SETTINGS OR WHO ARE LIKELY TO GO TO THOSE SETTINGS AND THESE ARE THE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE MOST LIKE THE INDIVIDUALS WHO PREVIOUSLY LIVED IN STATE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS THEY HAVE. VERY INTENSIVE BEHAVIORAL CHALLENGES. AND BECAUSE IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT WE IMPOSED A MEDIAN RATE FREEZE IT IS INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT FOR INDIVIDUALS TO MOVE FROM THESE VERY RESTRICTIVE SETTINGS OR IF THEY NEED A DIFFERENT KIND OF PLACEMENT BECAUSE OF A BEHAVIORAL CHALLENGE THEY'RE EXPERIENCING. TO FIND AN APPROPRIATE PLACE FOR THEM AND SO WHAT WE'RE SUGGESTING IS BOTH WISE IN TERMS OF POLICY AND FISCALLY SOUND. AND BAD IS THAT FOR INDIVIDUALS IN THESE VERY RESTRICTIVE SETTINGS MOON MANY OF WHICH ARE CALLED INSTITUTIONS FOR MENTAL DISEASE THEIR LARGE WALK SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES THIRDS TO THAT SERVE INDIVIDUALS ON IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA FOR EXAMPLE. THOSE THOSE FACILITIES DON'T GET ANY FEDERAL DOLLARS IT'S A REQUIREMENT BY FEDERAL LAW THAT IF YOU LIVE IN AND AM I AM DE THAT YOU'RE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL FINANCIAL PARTICIPATION SO WE ARE PAYING SLOW SOLELY WITH. STATE GENERAL FUND MONEY OF THE COST OF THAT INDIVIDUALS CARE WHICH IS VERY EXPENSIVE FOR THAT INDIVIDUAL. AND THAT'S BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE BUT EFFECTIVE MECHANISM TO HELP PEOPLE LEAVE THOSE SETTINGS OR PREVENT THEIR INSTITUTIONALIZATION THEIR AND OUR SOLUTIONS ARE. FIRST THAT WE RESTORE TO THE REGIONAL CENTERS FOR THE SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE THE ABILITY TO NEGOTIATE RATES BETTER BE ON THE MEDIAN RATE BECAUSE THESE ARE INDIVIDUALS IN CRISIS AND NEED A PLACE TO GO. AND THEN WHEN THEY'RE CRISIS IS RESOLVED A PLACE TO MOVE INTO. AND SECOND THAT WE FIX THE FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE BROKEN HEALTH AND SAFETY WAIVER PROCESS WHICH IS A VERY LONG PROCESS AND II DON'T SAY THAT TO BE CRITICAL OF THE DEPARTMENT I THINK THEY'RE ACTUALLY SERVE TRYING TO WORK THROUGH THE. BILL BACKLOG OF REQUESTS FOR HEALTH AND SAFETY WAIVERS FOR YOU AS BEST THEY CAN BUT WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT IT TAKES A HUNDRED AND FIFTY SIX DAYS ON AVERAGE WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT PENDING AS WELL AS THE NEW REQUEST THAT ARE COMING IN. TO PROCESS A HEALTH AND SAFETY WAIVER. IF YOU'RE IN CRISIS AND YOU NEED A PLACE TO GO THAT'S THAT'S A BIT TOO LONG TO WAIT BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GETTING THE SERVICES YOU NEED. SO. FIRST OF ALL FOR INDIVIDUALS CENTER IN THE MOST RESTRICTIVE SETTINGS ARE IN DANGER OF GOING THERE NICK LET THE DEPTH FLAT THE REGIONAL CENTERS DO WHAT WE THINK THEY'RE CAPABLE OF DOING NEGOTIATED DIFFERENT RATE FOR THAT INDIVIDUAL. AND FOR OTHER INDIVIDUALS WHO NEEDS HELP HEALTH AND SAFETY WAIVERS PROVIDE A MORE TRANSPARENT AND FAIR PROCESS WITH SPECIFIC TIME LINES BY WHICH THE REGIONAL CENTER WILL. WILL ACT ARM AND RESOLVE. BUT THE NEED FOR THAT SERVICE THANK YOU THANK YOU. NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM DIRECTOR BARGMANN. I THANK YOU. SO HAS YOU CAN SEE OUR SYSTEM IS EXTREMELY COMPLEX AND. CERTAINLY OUR OUR COMMUNITY IS STATES SUCH AN ELOQUENT JOB AND OUT OUTLINING IMPORTANT ISSUES AND AND THE THINGS THAT WE CONTINUE TO HAVE DISCUSSIONS ON ON A VERY FREQUENT BASIS SO. I'M APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS A COUPLE OF THE ITEMS THAT ARE OUTLINED IN ON THE OBJECTIVE TODAY AND HAS CERTAINLY BEEN DISCUSSED ON THROUGH THE DISCUSSIONS THAT YOU JUST HAD. SO SPECIFICALLY REGARDING THE THE RATE STUDY ON JUST TO GIVE A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON IT. THAT. AB EX TWO ONE REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT TO SUBMIT A RATE STUDY ON THAT WOULD BE AS IT WAS STATED. RELEASED IN MARCH OF TWENTY NINETEEN. WE DO HAVE A CONTRACT WITH BURNS AND ASSOCIATE. THEY'VE BEEN VERY ENGAGED IN WORKING WITH THE STAKEHOLDER COMMUNITY TO LISTEN TO THE CONCERNS TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S ARE DEVELOPING. ON THE SURVEY THAT THE SERVICE PROVIDERS NEED TO COMPLETE THAT IT'S CONSIDERING THE IMPORTANT ELEMENTS THAT THAT IS GOING TO HELPINFORM THAT TRAIT STUDY PROCESS. WE LIVE ESTABLISHED. AS A SUB WORKGROUP FROM THE DS TASK FORCE ON TO BE THE CENTRAL POINT TO WORK DIRECTLY WITH BURNS AND ASSOCIATE. IN ADDITION TO THE NUMBER OF STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS THAT HAVE BEEN THERE AND CERTAINLY THE DISCUSSIONS THAT. THAT HAVE BEEN. IDENTIFIED PART TODAY AS WELL AS MY DOES ADDITIONAL DISCUSSIONS HAVE BEEN VERY INFORMATIVE. TO OUR CONTRACTOR IN THAT PROCESS. ON THE OTHER AREA THAT IS LISTED ON THE AGENDA THAT. WANT TO SPEAK TO DO WHICH WAS JUST SHARED AS FAR AS A QUICK KIND OF THE COMPLEXITIES BUT ALSO. THE BARRIERS RELATED TO OUR HEALTH AND SAFETY PROCESS SO BACK AND. TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WHEN. THERE'S A RESPONSE TO LOOKING AT THE ECONOMIC CRISIS YOU KNOW LOOKIG AT HOW WE CAN ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE AREAS MANY OF THE INITIATIVES. DIFFICULT DECISIONS WERE MADE ONE OF THE AREAS WAS A RATE FREEZE. AS PART OF THAT PROCESS TO TAKE A LOOK AT WITH THE. RATE FREEZE COULD ABOUT COINCIDING LOOK AT HOW TO IS THERE GOING TO BE. A SAFETY NET OR A RELIEF VALVE IF IN THE EVENT OF CONSUMER SAFETY IS IN QUESTION SO THE HEALTH AND SAFETY PROCESS WAS ESTABLISHED IN ALLOWED. THE DEPARTMENT AUTHORITY TO BE ABLE TO ADJUST THEIR RATES IN RESPONSE TO HAVE ASSURANCE OF MEETING THE HEALTH AND SAFETY NEEDS OF INDIVIDUALS. SO CERTAINLY OVER TIME THAT PROCESS THAT WE'VE GONE THROUGH AS YOU'VE YOU'VE HEARD AND THAT. REQUIRED US THROUGH LAST YEAR IS TO ESTABLISH A WORK GROUP. TO IDENTIFY WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS WHAT THE BARRIERS THAT THEY'RE IDENTIFYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE STARTED DRESSING ON THE. THE LIST OF THE HEALTH AND SAFETY ITEMS THE REQUEST THAT HAVE COME IN. AND WE DO HAVE A BACKLOG AND IT HAS TAKEN TIME FOR US TO KIND OF WORK THROUGH THEM. THE WORKGROUP WAS VERY HELPFUL IN IDENTIFYING WAYS THAT WE CAN START ADDRESSING AT SOME OF THE AREAS A MUCH CERTAINLY THE CRITICAL AREAS AND WE DID WHAT THEY INDIVIDUALS MOVING FROM DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS WE PRIORITIZED. ON LAST YEAR AND WE HAD OPPORTUNITIES TO BE ABLE TO DO PROVISIONAL APPROVALS ON IN THE EVENT THAT WE NEEDED ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BUT THE SAME TIME NOT TO DELAY THAT PROCESS WHERE EXTREMELY OPEN TO BROADENING THAT. OPPORTUNITY TO PRIORITIZE FOR INDIVIDUALS IN. RESTRICTIVE SETTINGS THAT ARE AT RISK OF GOING TOO RESTRICTIVE SETTINGS AND WORKING WITH THE REGIONAL CENTERS TO EXPEDITE THOSE REVIEWS. ADDITIONALLY STREAMLINING THE PROCESS OF MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE WORKING WELL IN COMMUNICATING WHAT IS THAT. AYE AREAS THAT WE NEED TO HAVE TO INFORM US FOR THOSE APPROVALS SO WE CAN ALSO EXPEDITE. THE OTHER AREA THAT WE DID AT THE DEPARTMENT AS THAT WERE REVIEWING WITH THE EXECUTIVE TEAM EARLIER SO WE CAN BE ENGAGE IN THE PROCESS TO SAY OKAY WE DO NEED TO IDENTIFY THE VERY SPECIFIC ITEMS SO WE CAN. MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT GETTING STUCK IN SOME OF THE. BACK AND FORTH DISCUSSIONS SO WE CAN. I CAN HELP. JOHN DOYLE THE CHIEF DEPUTY CAN HELP WE CAN HELP KIND OF MOVE FORWARD WITH SOME OF THE THE BACKLOG MOVE THINGS. AND IT. IN A WAY THAT IS A TURN AROUND THAT IS GOING TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE INDIVIDUALS WHILE NOT PERFECT IT CERTAINLY IS AN AREA THAT IS A PRIORITY FOR US TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON. UNDERSTANDING THE THE URGENT NEEDS WITH SOME OF THE INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE SERVING. NIKITA ACTOR NEXT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE MALAYO INCOMES. SONYA PARTICULARLY OWE A LOT OF IMPORTANT ISSUES OBVIOUSLY WE'RE JUST AB BROUGHT UP. BUT WE WANT TO FOCUS ON JUST ONE OF THE ISSUES WHICH MISTER. WINS HE DID A GOOD JOB OF LAYING OUT WHICH IS THEM THIS ISSUE THAT AT THE WAY STATUE IS CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTED DOES NOT ALLOW VENDORS WHO ARE IN AREAS WITH LOCAL MINIMUM WAGES THAT CURRENTLY EXCEEDS THE STATE MINIMUM WAGE. Q. ACCESS A RATE. INCREASES. THAT ARE PROVIDED. WHEN THE STATE MINIMUM WAGE GOES UP SO JUST TO TAKE AN EXAMPLE THE VENDOR IN SAN FRANCISCO. WHERE THERE'S BEEN A LOCAL MINIMUM WAGE THAT'S HIGHER THAN THE STATE MINIMUM WAGE SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN? A VENDOR THERE MAY NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ACCESS ANY OF THE RATE INCREASES ASSOCIATED WITH THE STATE. MINIMUM WAGE INCREASES WHICH OCCURRED FOUR TIMES. SINCE THEN. SO WE HAVE. WE WOULD JUST RECOMMENDED THAT IF. THAT THE LEGISLATURE CLARIFY ITS INTENT DID INTEND FOR ALL VENDORS ACROSS THE STATE TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS THOSE RATE INCREASES AND IF THAT WAS THE INTENT THEN TO. A POTENTIALLY CLEAN UP THE STATUTE TO. MAKE IT SO THAT ALL VENDORS CAN ACCESS. THANK YOU. JACOB WHEN DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE'RE GOING THE MINIMUM WAGE ISSUES WERE HAPPY THIS WORK WITH THEIR STAFF IN THE LA ODA KIND OF GET OUR ARMS AROUND WHAT THE PROPOSAL WOULD BE TO DEVELOP THAT FISCAL ESTIMATE BECAUSE DEPENDING ON THE WAY THAT THAT. WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED COULD REALLY IMPACT OF. THE FISCAL IMPACT ON THE ROAD. IF YOU. NEXT WE'LL HAVE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE FOR. MY NAME IS DENNIS DEGREE. I WORK FOR THE SANDRA FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT. ALL THROUGHOUT. BOARD MEMBER OF. TASH. EL I WOULD BE UNDER. TO. HELP A FILM HOLDER. TO. HOPE WOOD HUMAN. MY NAME IS. STICK ME I'M MY. DANIEL'S MIGHT. THE FACT MATTER IS THAT WITHIN THE BAY AREA AND OTHER HIGH LIVING CENTERS. ONE CANNOT FIND AVENGERS TO TO ASSIST. A LANTERN MAX BEEN SET UP YET THE FUNDING HAS NOT BEEN PUT IN PLACE FOR REGIONAL CENTERS TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN HELPING THE POPULATION THAT THEY ARE INTENDED TO SERVE. WE CAN SPEAK FIRST HAND IN WHICH WE HAD SET UP FOR AN APARTMENT VENDORS AND THEN AND THEN THAT THE PEOPLE THAT WERE ASSIGNED TO US IN THE SIMPLEST WEEK WE CANNOT WE CAN'T. AFFORD TO LIVE HERE ON THAT AMOUNT. THE TWENTY FIVE MILLION IS ALLOWING FOR FOR THE WAGES TO BE AT MINIMUM WAGE YET. MANY PEOPLE WITHIN THE CAPITAL WOULDN'T WORK FOR MINIMUM WAGE NOR SHOULD DAY AND I FEEL LIKE MANY WHO WORK IN THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY ARE BEING PENALIZED FOR THAT. AND I THINK THAT THERE IS. RESTRICTIONS BEING PLACED ON THE REGIONAL CENTERS ON THE MEDIAN CAP FOR EXAMPLE THE ABILITY NOT TO NEGOTIATE WITH IN DIFFERENT GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS WHERE THERE'S A HIGHER COST OF LIVING. IN ORDER FOR FOR THE WAYNE SHERMAN ACT BE SUCCESSFUL ADEQUATE FUNDING ON. I THINK IT WAS THERE WAS A OR OTHER CALIFORNIA DISABILITY SERVICE SOCIALIZATION RECOMMENDED A HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION. AND AND THAT IS A SMALL STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION IN ORDER TO HAVE CARE GIVERS WHO WHO CAN LIVE WITHIN THE BAY AREA OR SAN DIEGO OR LA. A IN ORDER TO TAKE CARE OF OF OF THE MOST VULNERABLE POPULATION. WE WE HAVE THE FUNDING AND WE CERTAINLY ARE TAXED FOR IT ON YET WE'RE NOT TAKING THAT FUNDING AND HELPING THOSE THAT NEED IT THE MOST. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME CONSIDERATION THANK YOU. STEVE MILLER REPRESENTING THE LOS ANGELES COALITION OF SERVICE PROVIDERS BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY REPRESENTING. MY SELF WHO WORKED. FOR IN WITH PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES FOR SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY. EARLY SEVENTY NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT. I THINK THERE ARE SOME QUESTIONS THAT THAT NEED TO BE ARE ADDRESSED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IN THE DEPARTMENT DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES. THAT HAVE TO DO WITH COMMON. SENSE AND LOGIC. IS IT. IS THAT THEIR POSITION THAT AN ORGANIZATION SERVING PEOPLE IN SAN FRANCISCO. OR SERVING PEOPLE AYE IN. PASADENA. CAN FUNCTION WITH THE SAME REIMBURSEMENTS AS A PROGRAM SERVING PEOPLE AND TO LAURIE. OR A A A A MUCH MORE. MODERATE COST OF LIVING AREA. CAN THE SAME DOLLARS DELIVER THE SAME SERVICES. IT'S AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH. BUT IT IS STILL A TRUTH THAT IT COSTS A LOT OF MONEY. TO LIVE IN TO DELIVER SERVICES IN AIR IN HIGH COST AREAS. IS THERE ANY IS THERE ANY LOGIC THAT CAN BE PRESENTED THAT SAYS THAT IT DOESN'T COST MORE. I'D LOVE TO KNOW THE ANSWER TO. MOSTLY I AM HERE BECAUSE NOW I'M. I DID A LEADING ORGANIZATION THAT SERVES A MANY PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE LOS ANGELES AND PASADENA AREA FOR IT FOR MANY MANY YEARS. AND I STILL HAVE IN MY HEAD. THE CONVERSATION WAS A CONVERSATION. THE PLAINTIVE CRIES AND YELLING. AS I WAS TELLING OFF ARE A FATHER WHO CALLED ME WHEN I HAD TO LET HIM KNOW THAT WE WERE CLOSING A PROGRAM. THAT DID SERVE PEOPLE WITH VERY SIGNIFICANT MENTAL HEALTH. AND BEHAVIORAL ISSUES. AND WE COULD NO LONGER HIRE STAFF THAT HAD ANY QUALIFICATIONS TO SERVE PEOPLE WITH THOSE LEVEL OF DISABILITIES. SO I HAD TO CALL. AND EXPLAINED THAT THE SERVICES WERE ENDING IN TWO WEEKS. AND I HEAR. SOMEWHERE ELSE IN THE ROOM. THE WIFE. YELLING AT HER HUSBAND WHAT ARE WE GONNA TO TELL HIM WHERE WE GONNA DO. AND HE'S ON THE PHONE THREATENING TO. SUMI. DEMANDING. THE ONLY THING THAT ANY OF THE ORGANIZATIONS GET IN BUSINESS TO DO IS TO SERVE. WE JUST NEED THE RESOURCES TO SERVE. ASSEMBLYMEMBER HOLDEN'S REQUEST FOR TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IS NOTHING MORE THAN A VERY VERY SMALL TRANSFUSION. KEEP PROVIDERS ALIVE AND FUNCTIONING. AND OUT LAST THING I'LL SAY IS THIS WILL NOT BE THE FIRST BLACK COST STUDY THIS WILL NOT BE THE FIRST RATE STUDY. THAT THE DEPARTMENTS UNDERTAKEN IN THE LAST THIRTY YEARS. AND I'M OLD ENOUGH TO HAVE BEEN PART OF THE OTHER TWO. THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO GUARANTEE. FIRST OF ALL WHAT THE ECONOMIC CONDITION OF CALIFORNIA'S GOING TO BE IN TWO OR THREE YEARS. OR WHAT THE DECISION WILL BE ABOUT HOW MUCH OF WHATEVER THE RATE STUDY PROVIDES. WILL BE FUNDED. BUT WE'LL SEE IF WE CAN GETS KICKED DOWN THE ROAD AGAIN. IN THE MEANWHILE. PEOPLE EVERY DAY NEED SERVICES. THIS IS A VERY MODEST AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT IS GONNA MAKE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF DIFFERENCE IN THE LIVES OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. AND I AND I STRONGLY URGE YOU. TO CONSIDER THE INCONVENIENT TRUTH THAT WERE ASKING THIS ADMINISTRATION FOR A LITTLE BIT MORE MONEY THAT IS DESPERATELY NEEDED. THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR. HI GOOD AFTERNOON KELLY WHITE WITH VILLAESPERANZA SERVICES ARE SERVING ABOUT SIX HUNDRED FIFTY INDIVIDUALS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AND THAT BOTH LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND VENTURA COUNTIES. OF PRIMARILY OUR MAIN OFFICE IS IN PASADENA WHICH IS. BEING HIT WITH XCELERATED A STATE LOCAL MINIMUM WAGE ORDINANCE. THAT IS COSTS IN OUR AGENCY ON AFFECTED JULY FIRST ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS SOME REALLY SERIOUS DECISIONS HAVE TO BE MADE. WERE NOT THE ONLY ORGANIZATION THAT'S NEED TO LOOK AT THIS. IT'S BEEN VERY DIFFICULT TO RECRUIT A INDIVIDUALS IT'S BEEN TO SAID BEFORE HERE THAT. ARE INDIVIDUALS THAT WE SERVE WITH THEM TO RATE REIMBURSEMENT WE RECEIVE CAN GO WORK AT TARGET THEY'RE NOT TAKING CARE SIX INDIVIDUALS. MEDICATING HELPING WITH THEIR DAILY LIVING SKILLS FEE HELPING FEED THEM SIX PEOPLE IN A GROUP HOME. AND AND NOT AND MAKING. LESS MONEY THAN SOMEBODY WORKING AT TARGET YOU HAVE TO BE A VERY VERY HUMBLE PERSON. WHICH WE JUST CANNOT SUSTAIN AT THE SYSTEM CANNOT SUSTAIN IT SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE CLOSING THEIR DOORS. AND SO PLEASE PLEASE CONSIDER NAM HOW IMPORTANT THIS BRIDGE A GAP. THAT FINN ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOME HAS BEEN GRACIOUSLY. OF STEP FORWARD AND POSING ABOUT WHAT'S DISPLAY NEEDED WE NEED WE NEED THE TWENTY FIVE NINE. TO GET TO EVEN TO THE RATE STUDY AND AND BEYOND THAT SO THE SYSTEM IS THAT ON A BRINK TOM THANK YOU. THANK YOU MA'AM. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS KEVIN RATHBUN FROM A MINUS WE SERVE FOURTEEN HUNDRED UP WITHOUT MENTAL DISABILITIES IN SAN FRANCISCO EAST BAY. I'M ALSO WITH THAT CALIFORNIA'S DISSOCIATION AND WITH THE CALIFORNIA'S PUT LIVING NETWORK. AND AND DO ON. TO HOLDEN'S. GREAT EFFORTS. WE'VE GOT TO HAVE THAT BUT I WANT TO SPEAK ON THE RATE STUDY. IN ORDER. TO ACHIEVE THE RATE SETTING GOALS. MANDATE IN AB EX TO DOESN'T. OF CONSUMER CHOICE AND QUALITY OUTCOMES. STUDY MUCH USE MARKETPLACE COST TO CALCULATE SERVICE PROVIDER RATES. BELOW THE LOCAL COSTS OF LABOR AND BUSINESS RESOURCES ARE THE ONLY VALID BENCHMARK FOR CREATING RATES. THE LOCAL MARKET CONDITIONS. DICTATE HOW MUCH IT COSTS TO DELIVER SERVICES. WHEN RATES ARE SET USING LOCAL MARKET COSTS AS THE BENCHMARK. THERE WILL BE AN ADEQUATE NUMBER OF SERVICE PROVIDERS BECAUSE THEY WILL BE ABLE TO PAY FOR THEIR EXPENSES. SERVICE PROVIDERS. COMPETE WILL COMPETE FOR CLIENTS. CREATING A QUALITY COMPETITION IT DELIVERS QUALITY SERVICES. WHEN AGENCIES COMPETE FOR CLIENTS THESE CLIENTS HAVE CHOICE. I WILL CHOOSE THE VENDOR THAT BEST SUITS THEIR NEEDS. CALIFORNIA'S PUT LIVING NETWORK. IT'S CREATED FIFTEEN PRINCIPLES THAT CONSTITUTE A MARKET RATE MODEL. SETTING. A HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED SERVICE RATES. THESE PRINCIPLES SHOW HOW TO TAKE MARKET BECAUSE RATES IN CONCERT AND CALCULATE VENDOR RATES FOR DIFFERENT SERVICE TYPES. ESPECIALLY HOME BASED COMMUNITY SERVICE. WE WILL BE SHARING THESE PRINCIPLES. WITH YOUR COMMITTEE AND OTHER STATE LEGISLATORS. BUT THE MARKET LATE MODEL. NEEDS MARKET DATA. WE'RE DISAPPOINTED WITH BURNS AND ASSOCIATES THE VENDOR CONTRACTED TO PERFORM THE RATE STUDY. WHICH HAS PUBLICLY STATED THAT THEY ARE NOT GOING TO COLLECT MARKET DATA FOR THEIR STUDY. WHILE WE. ARE ENCOURAGED THAT BURNS AND ASSOCIATES HAS AGREED TO ACCEPT MARKET DATA FROM VENDORS. WE DON'T KNOW WHY THEY ARE PERFORMING THIS RICHARD RESEARCH THEMSELVES. UNLESS BURNS AND ASSOCIATES USES LOCAL MARKET DATA THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WE ARE FORCED TO CONCLUDE THAT THEIR WHICH STUDY. WILL BE DIVORCED FROM THE MARKETPLACE REALITIES SERVICE PROVIDERS FACE EVERY DAY AS THEY STRUGGLE TO SUPPORT PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AT THE CURRENT. BELOW MARKET PROVIDER RATES. WE ALSO MUST RELUCTANTLY CONCLUDE. THAT THE RATE STUDY. IT'S CURRENTLY DESIGN. WILL NOT MEET THE MANDATED GOALS. OF CONSUMER CHOICE. AND QUALITY SERVICES OUTCOMES THAT THE STATUTE DEMANDS THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR. CARLENE HOLDEN REPRESENTING MISTER SEAL AFFILIATES IN CALIFORNIA. I'VE GOT IT GIVE CREDIT FOR THIS WHOLE TOPIC IN THE WAY IT'S BEEN HANDLED LITERALLY AS I HEARD. EACH OF THE. PRESENTATIONS I CAN IDENTIFY THAT EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM WAS RIGHT ON. AUG CLEARLY IN THE LA MARKET WITH THE WITH DIFFERENT CITIES AT DIFFERENT LEVELS WE'VE GOT TO HAVE A UNIFORM PLACE WHICH REGULARLY PUTS US. ABOVE AND NOT ABLE TO ACCESS WHAT THE STATE HAS BEEN DOING THE REIMBURSEMENT ON AUG BILL WILL FIX OUT PART. AND. OF THE FACT THAT IT'S GOING IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE I'VE BEEN RATE INCREASES THAT HELPED A STABILIZER AT THE LABOR FORCE. I THINK THE INTERMOUNTAIN BEING REQUESTED ON THE FOUR PERCENT IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT ON THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT MANY PLACES THERE WAITING LISTS BECAUSE PEOPLE WILL NOT APPLY FOR THE JOB. SO CLEARLY IS AN ENTITLEMENT PROGRAM WE ARE HAVING A RUBBER MEETS THE ROAD ON THE FRONT LINES IF WE CAN'T GET PEOPLE WHO WILL COME AND APPLY FOR THE JOB WE CAN'T. A START IN A REASONABLE TIME SOMEBODY WHO NEEDS TO SERVICE. UP CLEARLY. IT'S NOT UNUSUAL FOR ME TO HAVE SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN THERE. AND THEN I AM OUR FACILITY. HEART WRENCHING STORIES SO ALL I CAN DO IS VERIFIABLY TESTIMONY THAT YOU'VE HEARD AND URGE YOUR SUPPORT. JAMIE DAVIS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR MARIN VENTURES AND CENTER FILE. A WE'RE ALSO MEMBER OF CDSA AND ON WE DO SUPPORT THE FOUR PERCENT INCREASE REQUEST. ONE OF THE THINGS I LIKE A LOT ABOUT LIVING IN CALIFORNIA NATIVE HOOSIER HERE A. IS THE COMPASSION SHOWN FOR THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE HERE. AND THAT'S EVIDENCED IN THE NEWS. WITH THE NEW LAWS PROTECTING IMMIGRANTS WHO. MAY OR MAY NOT. HAVE COME THROUGH THE APPROPRIATE CHANNELS TO OUR STATE. OF ABOUT EIGHTY PERCENT OF MY STAFFER IMMIGRANTS. I WAS JUST ON A VERY EXPENSIVE PHONE CALL. WITH GETTING LEGAL ADVICE ABOUT HOW DO I PROTECT MY EMPLOYEES. IN THE EVENT OF AN AYE NINE AUDIT FOR EXAMPLE. THESE THE KIND OF COSTS THAT WE DIDN'T GET COVERED IN THE WAGE AND BENEFIT PASSED THROUGH THAT MY STAFF DID APPRECIATE. BUT UP FOUR POINT FOUR TWO PERCENT ADMIN WHICH WAS ELEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND I CHOSE TO GIVE RAISES TO MY ADMIN STAFF. THERE A LOT OF OTHER COST PRESSURES. VETERAN ACTED EVERY YEAR. THAT WE CAN'T MEET. OR WE MEET THEM HALFWAY. OR. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT WE DO IT ALL THE WAY. YOU KNOW WE'RE ALWAYS JUGGLING THE PRIORITIES FOR. THE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDED TO SUPPORT OUR CLIENTS THERE'S A BIG PUSH FOR COMMUNITY INTEGRATION. GUESS WHAT MOST OF OUR CLIENTS ARE IMPOVERISHED IF COMPACT COMPLEX NEEDS. THEY'RE USE WHEELCHAIRS MOBILITY DEVICES. THEIR ELDERLY. WHO PAYS FOR THEM TO GO TO THE GYMIN MILL VALLEY SEVEN DOLLARS A POP? WHEN VENTURES. THROUGH FUND RAISING. WHO PAYS FOR THEM TO GO SWIMMING? MORE ADVENTURES. THAT COST MONEY IT COST MONEY TO FUND RAISER COST MONEY TO PAY THE STAFF IT COST MONEY TO FIND THE PLACES TO GO. SO ALL OF THESE PRESSURES. MAKE IT VERY HARD FOR PROGRAMS HAVE QUALITY AND THAT'S WHAT REALLY NEED FOR THESE PEOPLE I'VE DONE THIS WORK THIRTY YEARS. I LOVE THE PEOPLE. AND THAT'S WHY I'M HERE. STARTED OUT FIVE BUCKS AN HOUR IN AN ICF. IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN. SO I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE AT A DIRECTOR STAFF. I KNOW WHAT'S LIKE TO BE MIDDLE MANAGER I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE A LEADER. AND. IT'S HARD ALL THE WAY AROUND WHEN YOU DON'T GET ENOUGH TO SUPPORT A PROGRAM. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. I'M CONFLICTED DO I SPEAK IS APPARENT OR PROVIDER BECAUSE I WEAR BOTH HATS SO I'M. I LIKE TO SPEAK AS A PARENT FIRST AND MY NAME'S MICHELLE HI I HAVE A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD WHO WAS DIAGNOSED WITH AUTISM WHEN HE WAS TWO IT BECAME A CLIENT OF. THE REGIONAL CENTER AT THAT TIME I HAD NO IDEA WHAT THE REGIONAL CENTER EVEN WISE THANK GOODNESS FOR THE SERVICES. AND SUPPORTS THAT HE RECEIVED AND THIS TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THAT I AM ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOLDEN HAS REALLY CHAMPION FOR OUR COMMUNITY IS JUST SEVERELY NEEDED TO MAINTAIN THE QUALITY OF THE SERVICES. THAT ARE NECESSARY FOR PEOPLE TO LIVE QUALITY LIVES IN THEIR COMMUNITY ALONGSIDE THEIR PEERS WITH THEIR FAMILY AND ENJOYING ALL THE SAME BENEFITS THAT YOU AND I. I RECEIVE AS A PROVIDER ONE OF THE ON THINGS THAT I'D LIKE TO SPEAK TO IS THE MEDIAN RATES. MEDIAN RATES REALLY HAVE PREVENTED A NEW PROVIDERS FROM ENTERING INTO AND THE NETWORK OF PROVIDERS BECAUSE IN SOME. AND SPACES THE MEDIAN RATES ARE LOWER THAN WITH THE TRADITIONAL RATES THAT WERE NEGOTIATED AND THEN PROVIDERS ARE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO OPEN THEIR DOORS BECAUSE THEIR COMPETITORS ARE MAKING. A LOT MORE PER HOUR THAN WHAT THEY WOULD BE MAKING UNDER THE MEDIAN RATES AND I AM A MEDIAN RATE PROVIDER AND THE STRUGGLES. ARE REAL WEEK I HAVE TO LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF REGIONAL CENTER CLIENTS THAT I TAKE BECAUSE THAT RATE IS SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER THAN THE MARKET RATE FOR THE SERVICE. AND THAT I PROVIDE SO I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOLDING THANK YOU FOR THE TIME AND I AM I HOPE THAT WE CAN WORK ON. INCREASING THE RATES FOR REGIONAL CENTER PROVIDERS THANK YOU THANK YOU MA'AM. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS CARL LONDON I'M HAPPY LAND SUPPORTING PEOPLE WITH THE IT. INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT DISABILITIES. TRY TO BE BRIEF I I WANNA START JUST BY PRAISING THE STAFF FORMATS THEY SOME IMAGE IN THE EARLY IS. REALLY INTERESTING WAY PERCENT THE FACTS FROM TODAY AND LET PEOPLE TALK ON THIS REVENUE HAVING JUST TRADITIONAL. DEPARTMENT SAYS THE CENTER BY RESPONSE TO THANK YOU FOR THAT A PROCEED VIA THE WAY IT WAS PRESENTED AND ALSO YOU GUYS FOR HANGING IN HERE AND. LISTENING TO THE STUFF IS IT'S A LOT OF WORK ON YOUR BEHALF SO. IT'S GREATLY APPRECIATED I DON'T EXPRESS. SUPPORT FOR MR HOLDS PROPOSAL THANK HIM FOR PROVIDING. LEADERSHIP HEHAS ON THIS FOR REAL IN THE PAST COUPLE YEARS THAT'S VERY. CRITICAL IMPORTANT WHERE MEMBERS AND SECONDLY ONE EXPRESS. STRONG SUPPORT FOR THE PROPOSAL THAT MR GIARDINI OUTLINED WE HAVE TO HAVE SOME KIND OF BRIDGE RATE INCREASE IN BETWEEN NOW AND WHEN THE STREET STUDY COMES OUT. ARE WITH THE RATES DAY'S GONNA SAY. BUT IF IT'S HONEST INTELLECTUALLY IT'S GOING TO SAY THAT WE'RE NOT PAYING ENOUGH FOR THE SERVICES THAT WE'RE TRYING TO PROVIDE. OR IT'S GOING TO SAY MAYBE WE SHOULD BE PROVIDING CERTAIN THINGS ANYMORE AND THEREFORE ONLY PAY FOR THESE THINGS AND THIS IS HOW MUCH THE COST. WHO KNOWS BUT UNTIL THEN YOU HAVE A PROBLEM BECAUSE YOU OF OVER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE STATEWIDE? MANY OF WHOM BY THE WAY AREN'T EVEN ASKING FOR SERVICES WE DON'T EVEN TALK ABOUT THE SAVINGS. IN THIS SYSTEM FROM THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO SIMPLY DON'T GET SERVICES. SO EVERYBODY ELSE THAT IS GETTING SERVICES IS AFTER STRUGGLING TO FIND ANYTHING. OF SOME KIND OF QUALITY. GETTING MORE AND MORE DIFFICULT EVERYDAY THE RATES DON'T MATCH UP TO THAT THE STAFF THAT WERE PEEING OUR LOWER LOWER PAID RELATIVE TO THE COST LIVING THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT. THAT COST OF LIVING GOES UP EVERY SINGLE YEAR. IN WITH IT ANY CHART IN AMERICA IT'LL SHOW COLA THE COST OF LIVING GOING UP. AND THE RATES HERE ARE FROZEN OVER AND OVER AGAIN. YOU'RE NOW TALKING ABOUT THE PROVIDERS THAT ARE ON THE ROPES OF THE ONES WHO HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR FIFTY SIXTY FORTY YEARS. THE BIG ONES THE ONES WHO HAVE BEEN IN THE COMMUNITY AND EVERY PERSON WAS GETTING SERVICES. IS GETTING SERVICES DIRECTED BY AN IPP PROCESS THROUGH THE SYSTEM MEAN THAT THE. LEGISLATURE IN THE PAST TO SET UP TO THE WOMEN. ACT YOU HAVE BEEN AYE PP IN PLACES IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO GET. OUT OF THE SERVICE MODEL AND WE CAN'T PROVIDE THE SERVICES ANYMORE. I ALSO JUST WHAT IT'S WORSE THAN ON OF A BOARD. OF A LOCAL NONPROFIT YEAR'S SACRAMENTO I TRY TO PUT MY MONEY FROM A MOUTH IS BUT BEING INVOLVED IN THE SYSTEM. IN THAT MANNER WE JUST SAP TO A BUDGET PRESENTATION BUYER CFO RECENTLY AND I CAN TELL YOU IN LOOKING AT YEAR OVER YEAR OF LAST YEAR TO THIS YEAR. I WAS STUNNED BECAUSE I'VE BEEN SITTING ON THIS POOR FOR NUMBER YEARS. BUT TO WATCH THE FLIP THE NUMBER OF CATEGORIES OF SERVICES THAT WE GET RATES FOR. THAT SUDDENLY YOU ARE IN THE RED THAT USED TO BE IN THE BLACK NEARLY EVERY PROGRAM TYPE THAT WE PROVIDE. IS IN THE RED BASED ON THE ROAD ON THE RATES NOW. THERE'S A COUPLE OF AREAS THAT ARE FLOATING ARREST ANYONE TO SEE WITH THE ARE BECAUSE YOU GUYS MIGHT GRAB. AND DECIDE WE'RE BEING OVERPAID THOSE AREAS BUT THAT'S LITERALLY. WHAT'S HOLDING THE SYSTEM TOGETHER RIGHT NOW AND THIS IS AN AGENCY THAT'S BEEN AROUND FOR SIXTY YEARS LONG BEFORE I WAS. HERE SIXTY FIVE YEARS ACTUALLY CREATED BY PARENTS AND CONCERNED PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY FOR THEIR CHILDREN. IT'S BEEN AROUND THAT LONG IN THAT TWENTY MILLION DOLLAR AGENCIES STARTING TO LOOK EVEN ON THE ROPES AND TEETERING AND AND HAVING TO REFUSE. TO PROVIDE SERVICES BECAUSE WE CAN'T DO IT WE CAN'T OF THE STAFF TO COMMAND. SO WE WILL NOT BE OFFICIAL WAITING LIST BUT WE ARE LITERALLY TELLING THE REGIONAL CENTER. NO MORE UNTIL WE GET SOMEBODY TO LEAVE THAT WILL TAKE SOMEBODY NEW AND THAT'S THE ONLY WAY WE CAN DO IT NOW. THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU WANT IN THE SYSTEM SO DO THIS RATE INCREASE SHOW SOME LEADERSHIP DO THIS AS AN INTERIM STEP SUNSET IT I DON'T CARE. BUT A SUNSET ON IT. IN RECOGNITION OF THE FACT THAT WE'RE GOING EVER RATES STEADY ACOSTA IT'LL BE DONE BY THEN. AND WILL LOOK AT IT AGAIN BUT DO SOME KIND OF INCREASED A WHOLE THIS THING TOGETHER UNTIL THEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HELLO MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AIRING CARRUTHERS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE STATE COUNCIL ON DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES RISING IN SUPPORT OF TWO ADVOCACY PROPOSAL ITEMS THAT ARE IN THE AGENDA ON THIS ITEM. THE FIRST IS THE HEALTH AND SAFETY WAIVER PROCESS THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF THE PROPOSAL IN THE AGENDA IS TO LIMIT THAT TO THIRTY DAYS. A SIDE EFFECT OF THE MINIMUM WAGE QUESTION IS THAT THIS PROCESS WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT IS THE ONE THAT BECOMES THE VEHICLE. TO ADDRESS DIFFERENCES IN LOCAL MINIMUM WAGE UP BETWEEN THE STATE WHAT THE STATE PAYS AND WHAT THE LOCAL ORDINANCES. AT THIS PROCESS NOT SET UP FOR THIS PURPOSE BUT IT'S SERVING IT'S PURPOSE NOW SO AS THE NUMBERS OF THOSE REQUESTED SKYROCKETED FROM ZERO FIVE YEARS AGO TO NINETY EIGHT. JUST LAST YEAR THE WAIT TIME FOR PEOPLE HAS INCREASED WERE AT A FIVE YEAR HIGH IN WAIT TIMES OF MODERN FIFTY SIX DAYS OF THE PROPOSALS TO BRING DOWN THE THIRTY DAYS WE REPRESENT AND PEOPLE WITH DEVELOP DISABILITIES THEIR FAMILIES. WHO HAVE FROM THEIR POINT OF VIEW A TRUE HEALTH AND SAFETY? CRISIS THEY NEED A WAIVER FOR IN THEIR MINDS A MINIMUM WAGE LOCAL STATE DIFFERENTIAL. IS NOT WHAT'S ON THEIR MIND AS AS A CRISIS. SO PLEASE WE CAN DO TO ADDRESS THAT. TIME DIFFERENCE IN THE TIME DIFFERENCE IS THERE REALLY NO FAULT THE DEPARTMENTS IT'S JUST AM WHERE THAT CRUNCH HAS LANDED. AND THE SECOND ISSUE IS A DIFFERENT WAIVER IT'S THE SELF DETERMINATION WAY FROM WHICH IS THE PROPOSAL FROM. THE STATES TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO GET FLEXIBILITY IN THE SERVICES WE PROVIDE SO THAT INDIVIDUALS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES HAVE CONTROL AND CHOICE OVER THEIR OWN SERVICES. AND THE BUDGETS THEY CREATE OF THE STATE COUNCIL DEVELOPMENT IS ABILITIES AND I INVITED THE DEPARTMENT TO ONE OF ITS RECENT STATEWIDE SELF DETERMINATION VISOR COMMITTEE. MEETINGS WHERE THEY WERE REALLY PRETTY FRUSTRATED WITH THE DEPARTMENT FOR THE LACK OF PROGRESS AND AND THE DEPARTMENT RESPONDED NANCY. DIRECTOR BARGE MEN FOCUSED WITH HER MANY MANY PRIORITIES ASHY PULL THIS ONE OUT AND SAID THIS IS GONNA BE A PRIORITY IN HAS MADE GREAT PROGRESS IN ADVANCING THIS TOWARD THE FINISH LINE. IF GETTING ITS ADMITTED SO THE COUNCIL APPLAUDS OF THE DIRECTORS LEADERSHIP I'M IN THIS IT'S IMMINENTLY BEING ARE GOING TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. KEEP CHECKING MY EMAILS. HOURLY TO SEEING WHEN THAT WILL HAPPEN AT ONCE IT DOES THERE WERE ATTENTIONTURNS TO IMPLEMENTATION THERE MANY QUESTIONS A TO BE ANSWERED ARE NURSING THE DEPARTMENTS WORKING ON A PLAN. OUR STATE WEITZEL DETERMINATION VISOR COMMITTEE MEETS AGAIN NEXT WEEK AND WE ARE READY TO BE PARTNERS WITH THE DEPARTMENT IN FIGURE OUT THE IMPLEMENTATION SALUTE SMITH ROBERT STEPHENS THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR. HI MICHAEL COCKY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF ALL IN CALIFORNIA. WE PROVIDE RESIDENTIAL MONDAY SERVICES AND THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA LOS ANGELES COUNTY SO WE HAVE MAYBE A HEIGHTENED EXPERIENCE OF THE CHALLENGES OF WORKING WITH. A FIXED MEDIAN RATES. THE PEOPLE WE SERVE HAVE VERY COMPLEX. SKILLED NURSING NEEDS AND SOME OF OUR HOMES AND VERY COMPLEX BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS AND SOME OF OUR HOMES. AND IT KILLS ME THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ADVOCATING FOR MINIMUM WAGE FOR PEOPLE WHO AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED BY OTHERS. HAVE REALLY SIGNIFICANCE SKILL SETS TO IT AND SOPHISTICATION IS TO WORK WITH OUR RESIDENTS SIR WE SUPPORT THE TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR. ON GAP FUN BUT I THINK WE CAN DO BETTER. I THINK YOU KNOW AS SOMEBODY WHO SPEAKS ON A DAILY BASIS WITH OUR DIRECTOR STAFF A FOUR PERCENT INCREASE WOULD BE MEANINGFUL. BUT WOULD STILL LEAVE PEOPLE WITH CHALLENGES. LIVING AND THE AREAS WHERE WE PROVIDE SERVICE AND SO I'M HERE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT AND AND TO HOPE THAT WE CAN LOOK FORWARD AND YOU BETTER THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR. HELLO MY NAME IS SANDY JONES ON THE HUMAN RESOURCES DIRECTOR FOR STRATEGIES TO EMPOWER PEOPLE SUPPORTED LIVING AGENCY HERE IN SACRAMENTO AREA. I JUST WANNA GIVE YOU A FEW. THINGS TO THINK ABOUT AS YOU CONSIDER ALL THE INFORMATION A VAT. ALL TO SAY THIS A MONTH IN WHICH OUR TURNOVER RATE IS ONLY FORTY FIVE PERCENT IS A GOOD MONTH. THE IT'S CRAZY A GOES UPWARDS OVER FIFTY PERCENT CAN YOU IMAGINE TRYING TO WORK ON ANY OF YOUR PROJECTS ARE YOUR GOALS. AND HALF YOUR STAFF LEAVE. AND NOW RATHER THAN BEING ABLE TO WORK ON YOUR PROJECTS AND GOALS OR EVEN YOUR DAILY WORK YOU HAVE TO SPEND YOUR TIME. FINDING NEW STAFF TRAINING NEW STAFF GETTING THAT STAFF EXPERIENCE THAT'S WHAT WE DEAL WITH ALL THE TIME. EVERY DAY ALL DAY LONG. THE OTHER PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE IS WE CAN'T JUST SAY WELL MINIMUM WAGES ENOUGH TO HIRE PEOPLE WE ALSO HAVE TO TRAIN THEM. WITH THEIR TRAINING AND THEIR LENGTH OF SERVICE THERE SHOULD BE REWARD AN INCENTIVE. THAT WE STRUGGLE TO PROVIDE. WE ALSO HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE COMPACTION ISSUE OF THE PEOPLE THAT DO DECIDE THE STATE FOR LOWER THAN THEY SHOULD. THAT THEY MAKE THIS AND NEW PEOPLE GET THE COMING RIGHT HERE SO WHERE DO WE GO WITH THAT. THERE IS NO FUNDING TO GO UP HIGHER FOR EXPERIENCE LONG TERM STAFF WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THESE THINGS AND ALL THE OTHER THINGS THAT AS EMPLOYERS IN THIS STATE WE HAVE TO PROVIDE. SO PLEASE CONSIDER THOSE THINGS AS YOU HEAR ALL THE INFORMATION THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE CONSIDERING THINK YOU. HE CAME. TIFFANY RIGHT WITH THE SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION AND WE JUST WANT TO SPEAK SPECIFICALLY TO THE MINIMUM WAGE ISSUE FOR THOSE I'M CITIES I HAVE A HIGH. MINIMUM WAGE AND THEY'RE UNABLE TO ACCESS THE RATE INCREASE WE FEEL AS THOUGH THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO ACCESS THAT RATE INCREASE SO AT ECHO THE COMMENTS MADE BY MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE ARCTIC IN WHICH IS. ECHO THE COMMENTS ALSO MADE BY THE LA O. AND ENCOURAGE EVERYBODY TO KIND OF LOOK AT WHAT THE INTENT OF THAT IS. TO MAKE SURE AND ENSURE THAT THOSE CITIES ARE ABLE TO ACCESS THAT RATE INCREASE ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE A PARTY ESTABLISH HIGHER A MINIMUM WAGE THANK YOU. BUT YOU. GUY HOUSTON MISSION HOPE DAY PROGRAM. IN THE EAST BAY WE SIR FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY INDIVIDUALS EVERY SINGLE DAY. IT'S TOUGH BEING THE LAST IN THESE KIND OF THINGS BECAUSE EVERYTHING'S BEEN SAID OVER AND OVER SO. MUCH MORE ELOQUENTLY THAN THAT I CAN DO IT. BUT I JUST WANT TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT OUR PROGRAM. WE'VE BEEN IN EXISTENCE FOR OVER EIGHTEEN YEARS AND THIS IS JUST OUR EXPERIENCE THAT WE'VE HAD WITH WITH RATES. SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TWO. OUR NET INCREASE IN RATES IS SEVEN PERCENT. I AND THAT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE INCREASE IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. OF THOSE DOLLARS OF THAT SEVEN PERCENT SIX AND A HALF PERCENT FOR OUR PROGRAM. WAS OFF PASSED THROUGH TO OUR EMPLOYEES SO ARE SO US AS AN ORGANIZATION. WHICH AGAIN SEARCH FORM FIFTY PEOPLE ARE AND. IN SIX DIFFERENT LOCATIONS YEAH WE HAVE A HALF A PERCENT INCREASE FOR RUNNING THE BUSINESS. I AT THE SAME TIME YOU HAVE THINGS NOT ONLY COSTS GO UP NOT ONLY IN THE BAY AREA BUT EVERYWHERE. YOU HAVE THINGS THAT. THAT GOVERNMENT OF YOU KNOW FORCES UPON US A WE HAD THE TAX INCREASE OF FOR GASOLINE. ARE WE A MAJOR COMPONENT OF OUR PROGRAM IS TRANSPORTATION. AND SO THE GAS TAX INCREASE INCREASED OUR COST TWENTY TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH. EVERY MONTH SINCE THAT'S BEEN INSTITUTED. ARE IF THAT COULD BE REBATED OUR PASTOR BACK TO IS THAT BE FOR OUTSTANDING BUT THAT'S A COST. ANOTHER ITEM YOU'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT LATER IS IS EXTRA TWO DAYS OF OF THE EXTRA VACATION DAYS WILL THOSE OUR VACATION DAYS US WAS OUR PENALTY DAYS. BECAUSE ARE INDIVIDUALS ARE GETTING SERVICES. WE'RE NOT GETTING PAID FOR THOSE DAYS. SO IT'S A PENALTY AYE ITS ATTACKS ON US. BUT I I PASSED OUT YOU KNOW OUR HISTORY FROM OUR ORGANIZATION. AND AGAIN. LA ZEROES IN MOST OF THE YEARS. AND THAT THE SAME TIME ALL I HAVE TO COMPARE IS IS THE BAY AREA. THE BAY AREA. CP I. AND OVER THE COURSE OF THAT. FIFTEEN YEARS SINCE TWO THOUSAND TO THE COST OF LIVING HAS GONE UP FORTY FOUR AND A HALF PERCENT. AND AGAIN WE GOT OUR SEVEN PERCENT BUT THAT WAS PASSED TO EXCLUSIVELY ALMOST TWO EMPLOYEES. SO I'M HERE TO SUPPORT THE OTHER PROPOSAL CDSA OF THAT YOU KNOW WE NEED TO HAVE THAT FOUR PERCENT INCREASE. IT NEEDS TO BE OUT THERE IMMEDIATELY AND LOOK AT THAT AS A DOWN PAYMENT BECAUSE. AS BEEN SAID EARLIER IF THERE'S ANY INTELLECTUAL HONESTY IN THIS REPORT AYE IF WE REALLY HAVEN'T GOT INCREASE IN SIXTEEN YEARS THAT OBVIOUSLY WE'RE NOT GETTING ENOUGH MONEY TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES FOR OUR. INDIVIDUALS I AND SO LOOK AT THAT AS A AS A DOWN PAYMENT A VERY GOOD ONE AND MUCH APPRECIATED. BUTTA GOING FORWARD BEYOND IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE OF MOST OF YOUR GOING TO BE HERE. LOOK AT THAT IS AS. HOW WE CAN MAKE THE SYSTEM SUSTAINABLE ARE GOING FORWARD THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU CERN WELCOME BACK ASSEMBLY MEMBER THANK YOU? WELL CENTRIFUGES EXPLORED. IT'S ABOUT PEOPLE. WE'RE ADDING OVER TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE TO THE SYSTEM. WE'RE NOT ADDING. THE THREE THOUSAND DIRECT SERVICE PROFESSIONALS BECAUSE WE CAN'T FIND HIM WE CAN'T HIRAM WE NEED THOSE DOLLARS REALLY MAKE THAT WORK. I HAVE A KEY ADVOCATE I'VE ALREADY MENTIONED ONCE ALL MAKE SURE AGAIN CRUCIAL BIT HER LATER. WHO LOST A LONG TERM STAFF? TO GAS STATION. BECAUSE SHE GOT A HIGHER WAGE. THAT'S WHAT SOME A LOT SOMEONE WHO NEEDS TWENTY FOUR SEVEN SUPPORT GREAT COMMUNICATION WANTS BE HERE AS A ADVOCATE LOBBYIST AS A PROFESSIONAL. SHE NEEDS A LEVEL SUPPORT TO BE SUCCESSFUL IT'S ABOUT PEOPLE. SO THOSE PROPOSALS THEY'RE THEY'RE BOTH THE MEDIAN RATE RELIEF IS A KEY ISSUE FOR THINGS THAT ARE AT THAT WE NEED TO GET SOME WAY TO GET AROUND THAT. AND WE NEED SOMETHING THAT GETS US TO THE RATE STUDY BECAUSE COULD TAKE ANOTHER YEAR FOR THE LEGISLATURE DECIDE. HOW TO ACTUALLY FUND THAT SO WE'RE TALKING AT LEAST TWO YEARS OUT EVEN IF WE GOT IT ON MARCH NINETEENTH? THANK YOU SIR. MARTY MOTOR CALIFORNIA DISPLACINGYOUR CREE ACTION NETWORK AND ALSO A FAMILY MEMBER JUST WANNA SAY FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU FOR LISTENING TO ALL OF US. I KNOW YOU'VE CONDUCTED A LOT HEARINGS ON UNIVERSAL HEALTH COVERAGE AND OTHER ISSUES SUCH A FACING CALIFORNIA AND YOU'VE BEEN REALLY GOOD THE COMMITTEE. YOU AND THE STAFF HAVE BEEN REALLY GOOD ABOUT LISTENING. JUMP TO THE VOICES THAT NORMALLY ON HER I JUST WANNA SAY IS A FAMILY MEMBER THOUGH WHEN MY SISTER WAS STILL LIVE HERE DEVELOPMENT DISABILITIES OF WAS MORE ABOUT THE SERVICES SHE COULD NOT GET. IN THE SERVICES THAT SHE HAD. AND WAS A CONSTANT STRUGGLE AND SHE DIED IN TWO THOUSAND THREE. AND SAD TO HEAR AND I RAN INTO FAMILIES NOW WHEN THAT SITUATION STILL EXISTS. ONE ALSO SAY THAT DECEIT YOU'VE HEARD. PROVIDERS AND FAMILIES AND OTHERS TALK ABOUT. PEOPLE CLOSING BECAUSE OF OF LACK OF RESOURCES FROM THE STATEMENT YOU'VE HEARD IT FOR THE PAST TEN FIFTEEN TWENTY YEARS WHAT'S DIFFERENT NOW. IS THAT NEVER BEFORE IN HISTORY OF CALIFORNIA OR ACTUALLY IN THE NATION. HAVE MINIMUM WAGE GONE UP IN CONSECUTIVE YEARS FIRST ONE CONSECUTIVE YEARS BUT ALSO BY THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT IT THAT HAS BEEN INCREASED THOSE ARE GOOD THINGS FOR CALIFORNIA. NEVER BEFORE HAVE THERE BEEN INCREASES IN LOCAL MINIMUM WAGES. AS THERE HAVE BEEN IN SO AND ALSO THERE'S HEALTHCARE COSTS ALTERED CIRCUMSTANCES THAT DIDN'T EXIST. TEN YEARS AGO AND AGAIN THESE ARE GOOD THINGS ARE HAPPENING FOR CALIFORNIA WORKERS. BUT IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. SO I JUST WANTED TO POINT THAT OUT SO SECOND. TOWARD THAT END I DO WANT AN URGE THAT THE SUBCOMMITTEE IN THE LEGISLATURE. AND THE SUBCOMMITTEE IN THE OTHER HOUSE. SERIOUSLY CONSIDER THE PROPOSALS REGARDING. RELIEF AND I WOULD STE I WOULD A URGE YOU THAT I KNOW THAT JUST CONCERNED BUT ONGOING COSTS WHILE THERE'S GONNA WITHOUT KNOWING HOW THE RATE CITY'S GONNA LAND. IN MAY BE. TAKING UP THE SUGGESTION THAT SOME OTHERS HAVE MADE AND I WOULD ARE CHEAPER TO SUPPORT MAKE IT A ONE TIME. APPROPRIATION OF ONE YEAR OR TWO YEARS OR SOMETHING. UNTIL A RATE STUDY IS OF OR RATE RESTRUCTURING IS IS IS IS WELL FALLING ADOPTED BY THE LEGISLATURE. ALSO I WOULD OF ONENESS SUPPORT THE. ISSUES RAISED BY TO. ASSEMBLY RIGHT CALIFORNIA I THINK THERE IS ON THE RIGHT TRACK OF LOOKING AT PERSON CENTERED. ADVOCACY IN TERMS OF PEOPLE WHO WERE PLACED IN RESTRICTIVE SETTINGS THAT THEY SHOULD NOT BE PLACED IN. AND I DON'T APPLY DRC FOR ALWAYS STANDING UP FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS WE SHOULD BE PUTTING OUR RESOURCES TO GET THOSE PEOPLE OUT OF THOSE SETTINGS. I'M LAST WEEK ON THE RATE STUDY I'M ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF SERVICES TASK FORCE. AND I SERVE ON THE RATE STUDY WORKGROUP. AND I WON APPLAUD THE DEPARTMENT FOR THE WORK OF THAT YOU'VE DONE I'M LOOKING AT SHOULD. NANCY PARCHMENT. BUT I WANT TO SAY THAT ONE THING THAT'S MISSING AND IT NEEDS TO BE INCLUDED THAT WOULD URGE THE LEGISLATURE. TO REALLY INSIST THAT IT'S A DONE THE INCLUSION. OF FAMILIES AND PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES IN TERMS OF BEING SURVEYED. AND HAVING THEIR VIEWS PART OF THE DISCUSSION. IN A IN A FORMAL WAY SECONDLY. I THINK THEY'RE THEY'RE TRYING TO DO A PROVIDER RATE STUDY AND I THINK THAT NEEDS TO BE RE LOOKED AT. LOOKING AT A RATE STUDY AMINO RATE PROVIDER SURVEY THAT LOOKS AT HOW THE SYSTEM SHOULD BE. RATHER THAN THE RETRO LOOK AT HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS THAT'S BASED ON COSTS. AND DOES NOT TIE INTO OUTCOMES. WHICH IS A FAMILY MEMBER IT WAS ALL ABOUT OUT COMES FOR MY SISTER AND FOR EVERYBODY ELSE. SO THANK YOU. I AM JACKIE DELUDE VOSS WITH THE CALIFORNIA'S PART OF THE NETWORK AND ALSO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF STEP FIRST WE WANT TO RECOGNIZE ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOLDEN ABOUT THE BRIDGE FUNDING. I WAS LOOKING AT. THE THIRD CUP MANY THE THIRD ITEM ON THE AGENDA AS THE SAFETY NET. AND OF OUR DIRECT SUPPORT PROFESSIONALS ART OUR CURRENT SAFETY NET THAT WERE COMPLETELY LOST AND IF THIS BRIDGE FUNDING GETS US TO A RATE STUDY THAT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO GET US TO A RATE INCREASE. WHICH UNFORTUNATELY I'VE BEEN AROUND LONG ENOUGH TO BE SKEPTICAL I'M HOPEFUL. I'M ALWAYS HOPEFUL I WOULDN'T BE HERE EVERY YEAR AFTER YEAR BUT IF WE CAN'T SAY TO THESE PROVIDERS HAS TWENTY THREE COUNTIES TWENTY THREE COUNTIES AND THEIR BAKER TO SAY HEY DISCOVERY THE FUNDING. SO I CAN A POLICE PAY MY STAFF THE LOCAL MINIMUM WAGE IT'S NOT LIKE THEY'RE DOING A PIE IN THE SKY ASK THERE IS SAYING. GIVE ME ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY LOCAL MINIMUM WAGE SO AS WE TALK ABOUT THE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS BEING SERVED IN THE SAFETY NET PROGRAM AND EVERYTHING THAT WE ARE DOING. THERE ARE EXISTING PROVIDERS MY AGENCIES BEEN AROUND SINCE NINETEEN NINETY FOUR I USE TO THINK I WAS A YOUNG ONE AND I'M NOT. WE HAVE TO THINKWHAT ARE WE DOING TO THESE PROVIDERS THAT ARE EXISTING RIGHT NOW THAT ARE STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW AND LA AND IN SAN DIEGO AND IN EMERYVILLE WHO KNEW THE HIGHEST. HIGHEST MINIMUM LOCAL MINIMUM WAS EMERYVILLE I DID NOT. I'M IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY IVA COMPACTION ISSUE I HAVE A MINIMUM WAGE PROBLEM HERE HER FROM MY AGE ARE DIRECTOR OF A FORTY FIVE PERCENT TURNOVER RATE WERE DESPERATE THE FOUR PERCENT THE CDSA TALKS TO. HE HELLO LOOK I HEARD ENOUGH AMONG AB IF STUDENTS WANT ABOUT THE GOVERNOR HATES ACROSS THE BOARD I DON'T HAVE TO HEAR IT AGAIN I KNOW I'M GONNA HEAR IT. WHAT I HATE IS TURNOVER RATE THE LOSS OF QUALITY AND THE LOSS OF RESPECT UBER PROVIDER COMMUNITY SAY WE'RE JUST TRY TO DO THE BEST WE CAN? AND IF WE CANNOT RECOGNIZE THIS COMMUNITY TO DAY THAT'S BEEN IN THE SYSTEM SINCE NINETEEN SIXTY NINE AS OUR SAFETY NET BUT WE WILL BE LOST SO LET'S DO THE RIGHT THING AND BRED FUND THE SYSTEMS. THAT NEED TO SUSTAIN THEMSELVES BECAUSE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF CLOSING TWENTY TWENTY ONE HERE WE ARE. HERE WE ARE SO THANK YOU. NANCY CHANCE CHOICES PERSON CENTERED SERVICES I'M I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR. I AM. ONE ECHO PRETTY MUCH WHAT YOU'VE HEARD IN ADVANCE AND I WILL REPEAT THAT I JUST HAVE TWO THINGS I WANTED TO BRING UP WEARING A STAFFING CRISIS. I MEAN THERE IT YOU'VE HEARD THAT BUT IT'S TRUE AWARENESS STAFFING CRISIS WE CAN'T HIRE PEOPLE FOR WHAT WE'RE ABLE TO PAY AND SO QUALITY. IS IS THAT. AFFECTED. AND IF EURO. AN AGENCY LIKE OURS LIKE JACKIE'S LIKE THE PEOPLE THAT YOU'VE HEARD FROM YOUR GONNA TRY TO PAY MORE. AND GET THOSE QUALITY PEOPLE AND BUT IT THAT OUT THE. RISK OF GOING IN THE HOLE EVERY SINGLE MONTH WE ALSO HAVE A PROGRAM IN TRUCKING THAT'S THE SECOND THING I'M GONNA SAY TREKKIE IS EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE TO LIVE MEN. WE HAVE HAD A RATE INCREASE TO THAT PROGRAM IN YEARS AND WE'RE TRAVELING TO PAY FOURTEEN TO FIFTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR JUST FOR OUR DAY SERVICE PROGRAM. AND WE'RE THE ONLY PROGRAM THERE NOW THERE ISN'T ANY OTHER PROGRAM FOR THOSE PEOPLE THAT LIVE THERE IF WE CLOSE. THEY DON'T HAVE SERVICES AND THERE'S NOT A MECHANISM TO HELP US SO I SUPPORT THE BRIDGE FUNDING I SUPPORT BUT THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED HERE BUT WE HAVE TO. WE HAVE TO REALIZE WHERE THE STAFFING CRISIS AND WE OUT THE FIND A WAY TO FUND OUR STAFF THANK YOU. THANK YOU MA'AM. HELLO MY NAME'S CHATS FOR DOOR GOING ON THE. NEW VICE PRESIDENT FOR AL WHEN AND. SO I THINK I'VE BEEN ON THE JOB NOW ABOUT FOUR WEEKS AND. I'M GOING BACK AND FORTH FROM PENNSYLVANIA A COUSIN HAVING A TOUGH TIME MYSELF FINDING. AFFORDABLE HOUSING. SO. SO. YOU KNOW THE ISSUES HERE. ARE REAL AND. SO I DON'T WANT TO KIND OF REITERATE ON ON ON WHAT EVERYBODY ELSE SAID BUT. YOU KNOW WHEN WE TALK ABOUT LOSING PEOPLE TO A GAS STATION YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT. YOU KNOW SOMEONE GOING SOMEWHERE FOR A BETTER WAGE OKAY BUT. YOU KNOW. THE PEOPLE THAT I'VE MET ONE OF MY FIRST OBJECTIVES WAS TO GO IN AND TO GO TO ALL OF OUR HOMES AND MEET WITH OUR STAFF. AND THIS WAS AN ISSUE FOR EVERYONE OF THEM OKAY SO NOT ONLY. OUR PEOPLE CAN LEAVING OR CONSIDERING LEAVING. FOR BETTER WAYS TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR FAMILIES OKAY BUT WE'RE ALSO TAKING AWAY THEIR DREAM. THE PASSION IN THE DREAMS OF THE PEOPLE WHO WORK. WITH WITH YOU KNOW OUR RESIDENTS IT'S THEIR PASSION IT'S THEIR DREAM. SO WE HAVE TO FIGURE THIS OUT. THE THE OTHER THING I LIKE TO COMMENT ON IN THE LAST COUPLE WEEKS. YOU KNOW WHAT WE HAD A DELEGATION FROM NEW JERSEY. WHO CAME HERE BECAUSE? CALIFORNIA IS RECOGNIZED AS THE MODEL. WERE THE MODEL WHEN IT COMES TO PROGRAMS AND SERVICES BUT CLEARLY. WERE NOT THE MODEL WHEN IT COMES TO THE FINANCE PART OF IT. SO NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY FOR PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA. BUT THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY. AND THE REST OF THE COUNTRY IS LOOKING UPON OUR LEADERSHIP. TO FIGURE THIS OUT. BECAUSE WHEN WE FIGURE THE SAL. OTHER PEOPLE WILL FIGURE OUT TILL AND IF WE CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT. THEN IT'S MOST LIKELY THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT. A FEW DAYS AGO I TALKED TO SOMEONE FROM ISRAEL. WHO WANTS TO COME DOWN AND SEE THE CALIFORNIA MODEL SO THEY GONNA BE DOWN HERE IN JULY? SO NOT ONLY. WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA. BUT WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TOWARD COUNTRY. AND WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO THE WORLD. BECAUSE WHEN WE FIGURE THIS OUT. WALL FIGURED OUT FOR THE COUNTRY AND WILL FORGET OUT FOR THE WORLD. SO YOU KNOW. LET'S MAKE THIS HAPPENED BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT. YOU NO PROVIDING PEOPLE THE MONEY OR NOT PAYING ENOUGH MONEY. WE'RE LITERALLY RIPPING THE DREAMS AND THE PASSION. AWAY FROM PEOPLE WHO DO THIS WORK. BECAUSE THEIR STOCK. DO WE TAKE CARE OF THE RESIDENTS. OR DO WE HAVE TO LEAVE OUR DREAM AND OUR PASSION. TO TAKE CARE OF OUR FAMILY. THAT'S A TOUGH SPOT. AND IT'S NOT A SPOT THAT I'VE. YOU KNOW. REALLY HAD TO STRUGGLE WITH AS MUCH. UNTIL NOW. OKAY SO LET'S FIGURE THIS OUT AND TAKE CARE OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE TAKING CARE THE PEOPLE. OKAY THANK YOU SIR. YOU HAD I OUR DOG PASCO WERE FROM IMAGINE SUPPORTED LIVING SERVICE IN SANTA CRUZ COUNTY AND I'M. HERE TO SPEAK AS A FORMER GAS STATION ATTENDANT WHO CAME TO WORK IN THIS SYSTEM. BOTH WAYS AND I JUST WANT ARE ENCOURAGE THE LEGISLATURE AND THANK THE DEPARTMENT TO OF FOLLOW UP ON WHAT. MARTY SAID THAT. IT WOULD TO REDO THE RATES ARE NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT OUTCOMES AT. FEELS LIKE A WAY OF PERPETUATING WANTS CALMNESS HERE SO I HOPE THAT'LL BE ON PEOPLE'S MINDS. THANK YOU SIR. I RUN A LOT WITH CREEL I AM I JUST WANT TO SAY WE SUPPORT. ASSEMBLY HOLDINGS BRIDGE TO A FUNDING IT'S LIKE WE DEFINITELY NEED THAT BUT I HEARD THAT THERE'S A LOT ABOUT MINIMUM WAGE. YOU NO I WENT INTO THIS FIELD BECAUSE IT WAS A PROFESSION NOT A MINIMUM WAGE JOB. AND FOR A LOT OF THE PEOPLE THAT WORK HERE THINK THAT THIS IS A PROFESSION WHEN WE SHOULD BE ACTUALLY PAYING THEM FROM IT. I ALSO THINK TWO FOUR PERCENT PER YEAR. AND HAVE A SUNSET ON THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A FOUR PERCENT A YEAR EVERY YEAR UNTIL WE DO GET A WAGE RATE ADJUSTMENT ON THIS. WE NEED IT IT'S LIKE WHICH CAN DO THIS ONE TIME SAY OKAY WE DONE IT AND WE'RE GONNA DO A STUDY ON IT. BUT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS DOES GET DONE. THANK YOU. YES SIR ANY OTHER PUBLIC COMMENT. WE'LL BRING IT BACK UP TO THE DYESS I FIRST WANTED TO START BY THANKING ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOLDEN FOR. DOING THE HARD WORK THAT'S NECESSARY. NICKEL VASQUEZ OUR STAFFER FOR HUMAN SERVICES HAS SAID THAT WE'VE NEVER GOTTEN A LETTER PRIOR TO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET COMING OUT. BUT YOUR EFFORTS AND YOUR HARD WORK. HAVE BEEN REFLECTED BY THE QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF. INFORMATION THAT WE'VE GOT INSIDE JUST WANTED TO THANK YOU FOR THAT. I'D LIKE TO OPEN IT UP FOR ANY QUESTIONS THAT WE MAY HAVE HERE ON THE DICE. I I KNOW MISTER HOLDEN IS THE GIG GONE SO I DON'T WANT YOU TO BE LATE SO KEEP IT SHORT. FIRST THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THE LAST FOR THE HARD WORK FOR WORKING WITH EVERYBODY STAFF. I'M HONORED TO BE A CO AUTHOR ON IT WITH YOU. YEAH AND I THINK PART OF THE THING THAT WAS A MISSION WITH THE BRIDGE FUNDING IS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TWENTY FIVE MILLION FROM THE GENERAL FUND. BUT THERE'S ALSO MATCHING FUNDING FROM. THE FEDS THAT ARE ACTUALLY BRING THIS UP TO I BELIEVE THE NUMBERS FORTY FOUR MILLION. SO I THINK THAT'S WORTH MENTIONING. THE ENDOWMENT THEY OFFER THE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND SPEAK AS A DAD. I'VE LITERALLY BEEN THROUGH THIS WITH MY SON. WHERE WE LOST THE PROVIDER? BECAUSE OF FUNDING ISSUES AND THAT PROVIDER GOT SHUT DOWN SO I THINK. IT WE WE GET INTO THIS PROVIDER CLIENT CONVERSATION WHEN WE'RE UP HERE. BOUGHT IT. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE THAT ARE WORKING TRYING TO GET BY AND PROVIDE FOR THEIR FAMILIES WHO WAS REFERRED TODAY HAVE YOU KNOW SOME PEOPLE LOVE TO BE GAS STATION ATTENDANTS. SOME OF LEFT FROM GAS STATION ATTENDANTS COME HERE. BUT. WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE THAT PICKED A PROFESSION SERVE IN AND TO HELP. PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. WHO'VE MADE IT THEIR LIFE. THE SAME TIME THAT. BUT AS A DAD. WITH THE SUN THAT THAT'S BEEN DOWN THIS ROAD. WE HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS WHO ARE EXTREMELY. DEPENDENT ON THE SERVICES. I SURELY THINK FOR THEM THAT MY SON DID WELL IN IN THESE MAINSTREAM AT SCHOOL NOW. WITHOUT THAT HE MAY NOT HAVE BEEN. AND I THINK IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT AS WE'RE DOING THE STUDIES. AND AND WE'RE DOING ALL OF THIS WE HAVE TO CONSIDER WHY. IT LOOKS LIKE. WHEN A CHILD OR PERSON REVERTS. BECAUSE THAT IS AN EXTREME DIFFICULTY. FOR THAT FAMILY FOR THAT INDIVIDUAL. AND THEY HAVE TO FIND ANOTHER PROVIDER TO COMMIT ME HAVE TO START ALL OVER. AGAIN. AND THAT'S AN ADDED COST. THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE PERSONALLY THOSE OF US ON THE DYESS. DEPARTMENT A FINE LA OF THE THAT WE LOOK INTO. BECAUSE THAT NEEDS TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR AS WELL. SHELDON. AGAIN. THERE IS A MEMBER I'M EXTREMELY HONORED TO BE WORKING. WAIT WITH YOU. THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOLDEN ON THIS. AND I HOPE MY COLLEAGUES ON THE DICE PHIL IS IDEAL BECAUSE I KNOW I'LL BE ADVOCATING BE ON THE SCENE FOR THIS IS WHAT. SO I HAVE A COUPLE REQUESTS IF I MAY AS WE CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THE PROPOSAL'S RAISED UNDER THIS ISSUE. FIRST CAN THE DEPARTMENT AND FINANCE PLEASE PROVIDE A FISCAL AFFECT ASSESSMENT OF THE STATUTORY CLEAN UP PURSUANT TO THE LA O. RECOMMENDATION. REGARDING THE MINIMUM WAGE. AND SECONDS CAN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE PLEASE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THOSE MAKING PROPOSALS IN THIS AREA. EVEN IF IT IS TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO SEE HOW THESE IDEAS COULD BE WORKABLE IF THEY WERE ADOPTED BY THE ASSEMBLY. WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN AND RETURNED TO. ITEM ISSUE THREE. I THINK. SO. FACILITY. DIRECTOR GAINER YOU YES. TO CONFINE MY SPOT DIDN'T WHERE WE ARE TODAY. SO I'M AGAIN I IN IN RESPECT OF EVERYBODY'S TIME I I DO WANT TO MAKE NOTE THAT THE AGENDA. HAS PROVIDED AN UPDATE ON OUR SAFETY NET. PROPOSALS AND IT'S ON PAGE TWENTY TWO PROVIDES A GRID. THAT HAS SOME AREAS. BUT JUST A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND ON THAT I'D LIKE TO JUST SHARE. IN IN HEARING. OVERTIME CONCERNS ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENT OF RESOURCES IN THE COMMUNITY. WE HAVE. FOR MANY MANY YEARS IDENTIFIED OPPORTUNITIES FOR DEVELOPING RESOURCES AND WHILE THERE CONTINUES TO BE GROWTH IN OUR SYSTEM AND CHANGES AS FAR AS THE NEEDS OF INDIVIDUALS. YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE. THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE SOMEWHAT FLEXIBLE AND AND MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE TAKING A LOOK AT WHAT THOSE NEEDS ARE. CERTAINLY IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE WHEN THERE'S A MORATORIUM REPLACEMENTS AND DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS I'M NOT ONLY DID THAT TIME IDENTIFIED THE NEED TO DEVELOP RESOURCES BECAUSE INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE IN THAT COMMUNITY. THAT EITHER MAY HAVE BEEN REFERRED TO OR NEEDING. SUPPORT SERVICES SIMILAR TO THOSE AT AT THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER WE HAD TO START DEVELOPING RESOURCES. SO OVER TIME WE'VE REALLY IDENTIFIED HOW CAN WE START LOOKING AT DEVELOPING THE COMMUNITY RESOURCES TO SUPPORT INDIVIDUALS. WITH COMPLEX NEEDS. WITH THE SECRETARY'S DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER TASK FORCE AND THEN THE THE. FOLLOWING THE DC TASK FORCE THE DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES TASK FORCE. REALLY CAME FROM A DISCUSSION WITH ADVOCATES CONSUMERS FAMILY MEMBERS. AND AND THE MANY MEMBERS THAT ARE PART OF IT TO HELP INFORM US WHAT THE PRIORITIES ARE. MANY OF THOSE PRIORITIES FOR DEVELOPING NEW MODELS OF SERVICE. BUT ALSO RECOGNIZING THAT THEIR SERVICES ARE NOT ONLY FOR INDIVIDUALS MOVING FROM DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS BUT RECOGNIZING THAT THERE IS A NEED IN THE COMMUNITY AS WELL. SO AGAIN WITH THE SERVICES THAT ARE OUTLINED IN THE SAFETY NET PLAN THAT WAS INTRODUCED LAST YEAR. A A A DO WANT TO JUST MAKE NOTES THAT A PLAN IS NOT JUST A ONE TIME EVENT. IT'S IT'S A COMMITMENT THAT THAT WERE MAKING TO HAVE THE CONTINUE DISCUSSION. WITH THE INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY AND OUR AND MAINTAINING THAT COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT. WE HAVE A SUB WORKGROUP OF THE DS TASK FORCE ON THAT IS A VERY IMPORTANT ON VOICE TO US AS WE TAKE A LOOK AT CONTINUED NEEDS AS WELL. SO. AND IF THERE'S ANY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS REGARDING THE STATUS OF WHAT IS ON OUTLINED OR ON THE SAFETY NETWORK HAPPY TO ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS I JUST WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU I HAVE DOCTOR BRAD. BACKSTROM HERE WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ON THE OVERSIGHT OF THE STAR SERVICES IN THE ACUTE CRISIS SERVICES IN HAS BEEN. INTIMATELY INVOLVED IN DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING. THE DEVELOPMENT FOR THE ITEMS THAT ARE OUTLINED IN THE SAFETY NET PLAN. NEXT WE WILL HAVE KATHERINE BLAKEMORE FROM THE DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA FOLLOWED BY. AYE DIANA CARSEN FROM DISABILITY VOICES UNITED THANK YOU SO MUCH AND I WILL BE BRIEF BECAUSE I KNOW IT'S GETTING ON LATE. I JUST WANNA START BY SAYING YOU KNOW I AM THE DIRECTOR OF THE AGENCY THAT TWICE SUED THE STATE TO CLOSE STATE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS. AND I'M REALLY PLEASED WHERE WE ARE BUT IT ALSO MEANS I FEEL THIS UNIQUE RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT WITH THE CLOSURE OF THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS. THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE A SYSTEM THAT WILL ENSURE THAT PEOPLE PARTICULARLY THOSE IN CRISIS GET WHAT THEY NEED. SO WITHOUT I WANNA JUST ARM GIVE YOU MY THINKING AND MY AGENCIES THINKING ABOUT SOME RECOMMENDATIONS OF THINGS THAT WE ARM THAT WE NEED TO DO. BUT FIRST JUST MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE LOCAL CAPACITY FOR CRISIS SERVICES AND YOU KNOW WHAT THE THE DEPARTMENT'S CORRECT WE ARE DEVELOPING THIS I JUST WORRY THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE THIS THESE GAPS AND PEOPLE ARE NOT GOING TO. GET WHAT THEY NEED AND SO I THINK THE PLACE TO START IS TO ASSESS WHAT IS THE CURRENT. CAPACITY IN LOCAL COMMUNITIES WHERE ARE THE GAPS SO THAT WE KNOW IN ALL CORNERS OF THE STATE IN ALL REGIONAL CENTERS THAT THERE IS SUFFICIENT LOCAL CRISIS ARM CAPACITY BECAUSE THAT'S WE SHOULD START KEY PEOPLE WHERE THEY ARE. GIVE THEM WHAT THEY NEED TO AMELIORATE THE CRISIS AND LET THEM CONTINUE TO LIVE IN THE CURRENT LIVING ARRANGEMENT. WE ARE JUST ABOUT TO HAVE COMMUNITY CRISIS HOMES WHICH IS REALLY A TERRIFIC MODEL AND I APPLAUD THE DEPARTMENT FOR THEIR DEVELOPMENT OF THE COMMITTEE CRISIS HOMES. PART OF WHAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE IS THAT WE HAVE AFTER SOMEONE'S CRISIS IS AMELIORATED THAT THEY HAVE A PLACE TO GO BECAUSE IF THEY DON'T THE COMMUNITY CRISIS HOME WILL BECOME THEIR NEW HOME. WHILE WE'RE LOOKING FOR ALTERNATIVE ARRANGEMENTS AND I DON'T YET KNOW THAT WE HAVE THE NUMBER AN ARRAY OF SERVICES THAT ARM THAT WE NEED. THE NEXT IS TO REDUCE ARM OUR RELIANCE ON INSTITUTIONS FOR MENTAL DISEASE THAT I TALKED ABOUT OF A FEW MINUTES AGO. WE KNOW WE HAVE A GOOD MODEL IN THE STATE ACUTE CRISIS SERVICES THOSE WORK REALLY WELL. KUDOS TO THE DEPARTMENT FOR DEVELOPING A MODEL THAT ACTUALLY COMPLIES WITH THE STATUTE DOES COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENTS WORKS HARD TO GET PEOPLE BACK INTO THE COMMUNITY WITH THE WITHIN THE TIME LINES. BUT BECAUSE THAT CAPACITY HAS YET NOT YET BEEN SUFFICIENT WHAT WE END UP DOING IS PLACING INDIVIDUALS INSTEAD IN INSTITUTIONS FOR MENTAL DISEASE. AND THEY STAY THERE AND THEY ARE PLACES WHERE WE NOW GET DATA THAT SHOW VERY HIGH USES OF CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL RESTRAINTS OF INDIVIDUALS. WE SHOULD WE WE KNOW THAT PEOPLE HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME GETTING OUT OF THERE BECAUSE THERE ISN'T A MECHANISM TO DO VERY EFFECTIVE. ON TRANSITION PLANNING. SO WHAT WE. WHAT WE WANNA DO IS CHANGE ON HOW PEOPLE GO INTO THESE? INSTITUTIONS FOR MENTAL DISEASE AND AND ENSURE THAT PEOPLE CAN COME OUT MORE QUICKLY SO THE FIRST IS PEOPLE BUT GOING TO THE STATE UNITS AND PEOPLE WERE GOING TO I AM THESE ARE EXACTLY THE SAME PEOPLE BUT WE HAVE DIFFERENT ADMISSION CRITERIA. WE SHOULD HAVE A SINGLE CRITERIA BY WHICH PEOPLE GET ADMITTED TO EITHER ONE OF THOSE PLACES WITH I THINK THE STATE PROVIDING SOME OVERSIGHT ABOUT HOW PEOPLE END UP WHERE THEY AND WHERE THEY END UP. I'M SURE THAT DURING THAT TIME THAT INDIVIDUALS ARE IN I AM DES THAT WE TIMELY TO THE ASSESSMENT CENTER COMPREHENSIVE. AND THAT IS PART OF THAT PROCESS WE TAKE CARE TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE FIGURING OUT FROM THE BEGINNING WHAT SERVICES THE PERSON NEEDS ON TO LEAVE. I SAY THIS BECAUSE OF INDIVIDUALS WE REPRESENT ON GIVE YOU ONE VERY QUICK EXAMPLE WOULD REPRESENT A YOUNG WOMAN. ON WHO HAS BEEN IN AND I AM DE FOR THREE AND A HALF YEARS AT FIRST SHE WAS TOLD SORRY THERE JUST AREN'T ANY PLACES FOR YOU. AND SHE'S TOLD YOU'RE ON A WAITING LIST TO GET INTO PLACE AND THEN. SOMEBODY ELSE GOT THAT PLACEMENT WE'VE WE NOW INTERVENED AND HAD. ASSESSMENT IMPORT PEOPLE TOLD HER IS SHE'S NOT READY TO MOVE TO THE COMMUNITY SHE'S BEEN IN AN I. M. D. FOR THREE AND A HALF YEARS OF YOU'RE NOT READY TO MOVE TO THE COMMUNITY AFTER THREE AND A HALF YEARS. WHAT HAVE WE BEEN DOING AND WHAT MONEY HAVE WE BEEN SPENDING SO? TAKING SERIOUSLY AND HONORING THAT PROCESS SO THAT PEOPLE CAN LEAVE AND MOVE TO OTHER LIVING ARRANGEMENTS IS REALLY JUST NOT ONLY GOOD POLICY BETTER USE OF. THE STATE'S ARM THE STATE'S MONEY AND I THINK ONE WAY TO ENSURE THAT THAT HAPPENS WITH A LITTLE MORE FIDELITY IS RIGHT NOW THE DEPARTMENT HAS TO APPROVE. ANY EXTENSION ARM AT A NINETY DAY MARK WHICH IS HALF WAY THROUGH THE INDIVIDUALS ARM COMMITMENT THERE. INVOLVE THE DEPARTMENT EARLIER AND MORE FREQUENTLY AND REQUIRE THAT THE ARM. REVIEW THIS AT A THIRTY DAY MARK AND EVERY ONGOING THIRTY DAY MARK SO INDIVIDUALS ARE NOT STUCK THERE FOR THREE AND A HALF YEARS ONLY TO LEARN THAT THEY'RE NOT READY TO HAVE. TO MOVE ON OUT THE LAST ONE I'LL TALK ABOUT ON IN THE REST IS JUST IN OUR TESTIMONY IS WE HAVE CLIENTS RIGHTS ADVOCATES ARM. WHO HAVE? CONTINUE TO REPRESENT PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THESE RESTRICTIVE LIVING ARRANGEMENTS WITH A FAIR AMOUNT OF SUCCESS OF SOME OTHER EXAMPLES OF THAT COULD WORK AT THE END. ONE OF THE WAYS THEY CAN BE MOST EFFECTIVE AND HOPEFUL IN THAT PROCESS IS BY HAVING ACCESS TO THE SAME INFORMATION THAT OTHER MEMBERS OF THE TEAM HAVE. WHO ARE PARTICIPATING IN THAT TRANSITION PLANNING WE'VE DONE THAT IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES WHEN THEY GET NOTICED BUT NOT CONSISTENTLY STATUTORILY SO WE WANT TO WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT TO CLEAN UP THAT LANGUAGE IN AND THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND ENSURE THAT? OUR STAFF CAN BE THE MOST HELPFUL AND HELPED DESIGN THE KIND OF. AFFECTED TRANSITION PLANS THAT WILL KEEP PEOPLE MOVING TO THE OTHER TYPES OF PLACES IN IN THE COMMUNITY THANK YOU. THANK YOU. HI MY NAME IS THE ANNA PASTERNAK CARSON IM WITH DISABILITY VOICES UNITED I'M A KINDERGARTEN TEACHER. AYE IN SAN DIEGO I ALSO TEACH AT SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY IN THE FIELD OF DISABILITY STUDIES. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY I AM A SISTER AND AN ADVOCATE FOR MY BROTHER PLUCKING CARSON. AND IF I MAY SAY YOU HAVE A WONDERFUL NAME MY FAMILY WOULD AGREE INCLUDING MY GRANDFATHER* MY UNCLE PLUCKING MY THREE COUSINS JOAQUIN AND MY. AUNT JOAQUIN. TRUE STORY. MY BROTHER JOAQUIN WASTED A TOTAL OF FIFTEEN YEARS ON TWO SEPARATE OCCASIONS. ONCE FOR EIGHT YEARS AND ONCE FOR SEVEN YEARS IN FAIRVIEW DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER. WHICH WAS TWO HOURS AWAY FROM. OUR HOME OUR FAMILY TRAVELED TWO TO THREE HOURS EACH WAY IN TRAFFIC EVERY WEEKEND. TO SPEND TIME WITH HIM AND ASSURE HIM THAT WE STILL LOVED HIM. BOTH TIMES IN THE DC WERE THE RESULT OF BEHAVIORAL CRISES WITH NO COMMUNITY SUPPORTS OR RESOURCES TO SERVICE NEEDS AND MEET OUR FAMILY'S NEEDS. WE HAD NO ALTERNATIVE. WE VOWED THAT WE WOULD GET HIM OUT AND NEVER LET THIS HAPPEN AGAIN. WE ENTERED A THREE YEAR LEGAL BATTLE WITH THE HELP OF. DRC. AGAINST THE SAN DIEGO REGIONAL CENTER TO BRING WALKING BACK HOME INTO THE COMMUNITY WITH SUPPORTIVE LIVING SERVICES. HE'S BEEN HOME FOR SIX YEARS. OUR FAMILY HAS BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE WALKING WITH THE HOME OF HIS OWN THAT IS WALKING A FIGHT AS WE CALL IT. ON OUR PROPERTY. AND CREATIVE SUPPORT THAT ARE PERSONALIZED BASED ON HIS NEEDS. HE'S HAD CRISES SINCE HE'S BEEN HOME. BUT HE AND WE HAVE GOTTEN THROUGH THEM SAFELY BECAUSE OF THE PERSON SENATE CENTER PLANNING. I NEEDED RESOURCES THAT ARE IN PLACE. ALTHOUGH OUR FAMILY HAS FUNDED JOAQUIN'S HOUSING. BECAUSE JOAQUIN WAS A DC RESIDENT HE HAS EXTRA FUNDING AND RESOURCES TO HELP ENSURE HIS SUCCESS IN THE COMMUNITY AND FOR THAT OUR FAMILY IS ETERNALLY GRATEFUL. BUT JOAQUIN WOULD NOT HAVE ENDED UP. IN THE DC TWICE. HAD SAFETY NET SERVICES BEEN IN PLACE TO BEGIN WITH. WHEN HE WAS A CHILD. AND THAT IS WHAT WE WANT TO SPEAK TO TODAY. CRISES HAPPEN NOT ONLY TO ADULTS EXITING DC'S BUT THEY ARE VERY REAL FOR MANY FAMILIES MANY CHILDREN WERE LEFT FLOUNDERING WITHOUT HELP WITHOUT HOPE. CRISES HAPPEN. FOR CHILDREN AND ADULTS AND FAMILIES DVD YOU ONCE THE LEGISLATURE TO UNDERSTAND THIS REALITY AND BE COGNIZANT OF THE IMPACT OF YOUR DECISIONS RELATED TO FUNDING AND OVERSIGHT OF DTS. ONE OF OUR CONCERNS IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND DTS THE SAFETY NET PLAN HAVE. FOCUSED ON DEVELOPING SERVICE SERVICES FOURTH FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR DC MOVERS AND NOT ENOUGH ATTENTION HAS BEEN PAID. TWO THE FAR GREATER NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS WHO RESIDE WITH THEIR FAMILIES ARE IN COMMUNITY SETTINGS WHO HAVE EQUALLY CHALLENGING SUPPORT NEEDS. ANOTHER CONCERN IS THAT DTS IS PLAN IS MOVING SLOWLY. THE CRISES THAT FAMILIES EXPERIENCE ARE VERY REAL AND DC CLOSURES ALTHOUGH A GOOD THING MEAN THAT PEOPLE WILL END UP IN EMERGENCY ROOMS. AND IN JAILS WITHOUT THERAPEUTIC SERVICES FOR EXTENDED PERIODS OF TIME IF WE DO NOT ENSURE THAT APPROPRIATE SUPPORTS IN PLACE WITHIN EACH REGIONAL CENTER AREA. ALTHOUGH WE THINK DDS FOR INCLUDING STAKEHOLDERS IN THE PLANNING PROCESS AND WE ARE ENCOURAGED THAT DTS HAS PROMISED. THAT SERVICES WILL BE DEVELOPED THROUGH PERSON CENTERED PLANNING. WITH A FOCUS ON CULTURAL COMPETENCE POSITIVE BEHAVIOR SUPPORTS AND TRAUMA INFORMED CARE. WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THERE IS NOT ADEQUATE OVERSIGHT TO ENSURE THAT THESE GOALS ARE MET. WITH EACH INDIVIDUAL MEETING SAFETY NET SERVICES. WE'VE LAID OUT A SET OF RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE REALITY CHECK PAPER. THAT YOU HAVE. WITH THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF KEEPING INDIVIDUALS IN CRISIS IN THEIR HOMES IN THE COMMUNITY BUT THAT IF THAT IS NOT POSSIBLE WE ADVOCATE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF SERVICES AND SUPPORTS THAT CAN'T SAY NO. MEANING THEY CANNOT DENY OR REMOVE THE INDIVIDUAL BECAUSE OF THEIR BEHAVIORS. THE SPECIFIC RECOMMENDED EAT DACIANS ARE IN THE PACKET BUT I'M GOING TO SUMMARIZE A FEW. WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT PARENTS ARE INFORMED ABOUT AVAILABILITY OF A CONTINUING. CONTINUUM OF CRISIS SERVICES THAT SUPPORT PEOPLE STAYING IN THEIR HOMES AND COMMUNITIES. WE NEED TO MAKE IT EASIER AND FASTER FOR INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES IN CRISIS TO RECEIVE A HEALTH AND SAFETY WAIVER FROM DTS SO THAT THEY CAN PAY THEIR WORKERS. HIGHER RATE IN ORDER TO SUPPORT SOMEONE WITH EXTREME BEHAVIORS. WE NEED TO CREATE DEADLINES NOW BECAUSE PEOPLE IN CRISIS CANNOT WAIT WE NEED TO BE SURE THAT SERVICES AND HOUSING ARE AVAILABLE TO ALL INDIVIDUALS IN CRISIS INCLUDING CHILDREN. AND NOT FOCUS PRIMARILY ON THOSE LIVING OUT OF DC'S WE NEED TO BE SURE THAT PEOPLE. NEEDS HAVE BEEN MET WHEN THEY ARE IN CRISIS AND THAT THEY BECOME STABILIZED IN ORDER TO TAKE THEM BACK HOME OR INTO THE COMMUNITY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. WE NEED TO HOLD REGIONAL CENTERS ACCOUNTABLE FOR PROVIDING CHOICES THAT FIT WITH THE FAMILIES CULTURAL PREFERENCES. AND BASED ON PERSON CENTERED PLANNING. THERE NEEDS TO BE CHOICES OFFERED. WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT CRISIS TEAMS AND COMMUNITY AGENCY STAFF ARE TRAINED. TO RECOGNIZE. AND TREAT THE ROOT OF THE CRISES IN A DIGNIFIED AND RESPECTFUL MANNER. IN ORDER TO DO ALL THESE THINGS. WE NEED TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO DEVELOP MORE OPTIONS FOR INDIVIDUALS. INCLUDING RESTORING FUNDS FROM THE FISCAL YEAR TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN TO TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. WELL STAKEHOLDERS HAVE BEEN AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE DTS PLANNING PROCESS AND WE THINK THEM FOR THAT. ALL OF THE FAMILY MEMBERS WHO SERVE ON THE DISABILITY SERVICE TASK FORCE REPRESENT OLDER ADULTS MOST OF WHOM HAVE LIVED OR CURRENTLY LIVE IN A DC. HE NET SHOULD BE WIDENED INCLUDE FAMILY MEMBERS. CHILDREN AND YOUNG ADULTS WHO ARE IN CRISIS AS WELL. THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF DISABILITY VOICES UNITED ALL OF US OF WHOM ARE VOLUNTEERS URGE YOU TO STUDY OUR REPORT AND RECOMMENDATIONS AND RELY ON THEM TO MAKE THE MOST INCLUSIVE AND MOST RESPONSIBLE. DECISIONS FOR CALIFORNIANS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES WHO ARE IN CRISIS. THE FEEL FREE TO CONTACT US IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR NEED OUR ASSISTANCE IN ANYWAY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU DIANA AND TELL MY THE CRYO YOUR BROTHER. THE CHIEF PARLIAMENTARIAN HAS TOLD ME IN. OUR STATE'S HISTORY ON THE FIRST JOAQUIN WE WERE ELECTED TO THIS NEW LEGISLATURE. BUT BUT BUT BUT. I WILL HE MIGHT BE FOLLOWING YOU. HAPPY TO GRADUALLY SOME FUN. NEXT I'D LIKE TO HEAR FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE KNOW THEY'LL PLEASE. SONYA PADDICK ILIO. M. AS HAS BEEN ALLUDED TO BY THE PREVIOUS SPEAKERS. THE STATE MAY VERY WELL HAVE TO CONSIDER WHAT FUTURE WHAT WHAT SERVICES ARE NEEDED IN THE FUTURE BEYOND WHAT'S ALREADY BEEN APPROVED AND. FIVE FUNDS HAVE BEEN APPROPRIATED FOR. SO TO THIS AND WE NOTE THAT IN LAST YEAR'S TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. SHEET THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS REQUIRED TO PROVIDE QUARTERLY UPDATES TO LEGISLATIVE STAFF. ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE COMMUNITY BASED. SAFETY NET AND CRISIS SERVICES. WE SUGGESTED THAT THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT REQUEST SOME ADDITIONAL SUBVERT MEAN SPECIFIC INFORMATION TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHETHER THE. CURRENT SERVICES THAT ARE PLANNED ARE GOING TO BE ADEQUATE WHETHER THEY'RE REALLY FEELING THE NEED AND WHAT. AND AND GIVE THE LEGISLATURE SORT OF INSIGHT INTO WHAT MIGHT BE NEEDED IN THE FUTURE. WE PROVIDED SOME EXAMPLES THAT ARE IN THE AGENDA SUCH AS HOW OFTEN THE MOBILE CRISIS UNITS ARE ENGAGED ARM HOW OFTEN THE SAFETY NETS TO HOMES REACH CAPACITY. HOW DDS IS COORDINATING WITH REGIONAL CENTERS? AND. MORE INFORMATION ABOUT HOW MANY INDIVIDUALS GET PLACED IN MORE RESTRICTIVE SETTINGS AS MS BLACKMAR. SPOKE ABOUT. AND WE DO WANT TO NOTE HOWEVER THAT. THE DEPARTMENT IN THE IN THE LAST MEETING OF THE COMMUNITY SUPPORTS AND SAFETY NETWORK GROUP THAT'S PART OF THE DS TASK FORCE THE DEPARTMENT DID PROVIDE. A LOT OF A FAIRLY DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT SOME OF THESE ISSUES AND WERE WILLING TO WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS ON SPECIFIC REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION. NEVERTHELESS THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO FORMALIZE. SOME OF THESE INFORMATION REQUESTS THE DEPARTMENT. DEPARTMENT FUNDS. JACOB I'M DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE'RE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOUR STAFF GO LOOK AT WHAT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION CAN PROVIDE DURING THE QUARTERLY BRIEFINGS TO MAKE THAT BENEFICIAL FOR ALL PARTICIPANTS ó WE PREFER TO STAY AWAY FROM SOLANO. PORTING LANGUAGE BUT AGAIN WE'RE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOUR STAFF TO SEE WHAT WE CAN PROVIDE DURING THE CORD BRIEFINGS THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WILL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE THREE. AARON CARRUTHERS EXECUTRIX OF THE STATE COUNCIL ON DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES RISING IN SUPPORT OF THE TESTIMONY FROM THE DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA RELATED TO ASSESSING THE SAFETY NET ARMED SERVICES. AND CAPACITY AND MOST IMPORTANTLY THE GAPS OF THE COW THE STATE COUNCIL THINKS IN A VERY EFFECTIVE STRATEGY ARE THE MOBILE CRISIS UNITS. AND WANTS TO BE SURE THAT AS THE STATE'S DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES HAS SOME OF THESE AND REGIONAL CENTERS HAVE SOME OF THESE. THAT WE INCORPORATE THOSE INTO UNDERSTANDING THE COMPLETE PICTURE OF SERVICES THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANY FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE THREE. YEAH HI MY NAME IS PHILBIN A AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE LOCAL REGIONAL CENTER HERE IN SACRAMENTO WE SERVE. ABOUT TWENTY THREE THOUSAND FOLKS AND. HAVE BEEN REALLY BIG PARTNERS I THINK WITH THAT WITH OTHER REGIONAL CENTERS IN WITH THE DEPARTMENT IN THAT. HELPING PEOPLE LEAVE THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS WHICH HAS REALLY BEEN ONE OF THE THE GREAT. GREAT PROJECTS THAT I'VE BEEN ABLE TO WORK ON IN MY LIFE. BUT BIRD WE'RE NEARING THE END AT OUR REGIONAL CENTER WERE DOWN TO TEN PEOPLE AT HOME A DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER I MEAN THAT IS. THAT IS AN AMAZING DAY TO BE AT. BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE DON'T STILL HAVE A LOT OF FOLKS WITH. THE I MEAN THE SAME NEEDS AS THE PEOPLE WHO WERE COMING OUT OF THEIR WHO ARE BEING INCREDIBLY WELL TAKEN CARE OF FROM WHAT I CAN SEE. BUT THE EXCITING THING IS WHAT WE'VE LEARNED. FROM THE DEVELOPMENT OF OF SERVICES INCLUDING MOBILE CRISIS SERVICES AND OTHER TYPES OF SERVICES FROM OUR DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER EXPERIENCE I THINK WE GET TO FINALLY. NOT HAVE TO ALWAYS WORRY ABOUT TAKING PEOPLE OUT OF THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS AND WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO SPEND THAT MONEY IN THE COMMUNITY AND THERE ARE NEW FUNDS AS WE'VE HEARD. THAT ARE BECOMING COMING FORWARD FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMMUNITY RESOURCES AND. I KNOW THAT MANY OF US ARE GOING TO BE. FIGHTING HARD ON BEHALF OF THE FOLKS WHO FIND THEMSELVES OCCASIONALLY AND REALLY SERIOUS CRISIS SITUATIONS SANTA. WE'VE LEARNED HOW HOW TO HELP PEOPLE WE REALLY HAVE AN ENHANCED BEHAVIORAL. SUPPORT HOMES ARE ONE WAY THAT PEOPLE DON'T GET KICKED OUT ZERO. ZERO REJECTION OPTIONS ARE CLOSE TO ZERO REJECTION OPTIONS I THINK ARE REALLY IMPORTANT TO OUR FOLKS SO. I WANT TO THANK THE DEPARTMENT FOR THEIR THEIR LEADERSHIP HERE AND ADD MORE CERTAINLY HAPPY TO BE PART OF THE TEAM THAT'S GONNA. BRING THIS AROUND TEN AND HELP FOLKS IN CRISIS. THANK YOU SIR OKAY. SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT ON BRING IT UP TO THE DYESS MANY QUESTIONS WE MAY HAVE. SEEING NONE. REGARDING THE ONLY OWES SUGGESTION ON OVERSIGHT I'M INTERESTED IN FORMALIZING THE INFORMATION REQUESTED ON SAFETY NET THAT THE LA O. HAS SUGGESTED. CAN I ASK FOR THE ELIOT TO ASSIST IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF DRAFT SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING LANGUAGE. THAT THE SUBCOMMITTEE COMMITTEE MAY CONSIDER WHEN WE TAKE UP THE MAY REVISION. FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES. AND THEN SECONDLY I WANT TO THANK THE DEPARTMENT FOR PROVIDING SOME INITIAL FEEDBACK ON WHAT ADVOCATES HAVE RAISED. AND SPECIFIC SUGGESTIONS FROM DR SEE I'D LIKE TO ASK THE DEPARTMENTS TO PLEASE WORK WITH THE SUBCOMMITTEE STAFF. TO FOLLOW UP ON THESE IN MORE DEPTH IN PREPARATION FOR OUR WORK IN MAY AND JUNE. WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE THREE OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE FIVE. EXCUSE ME I NOW SEE ASSEMBLY MEMBER LACKEY HERE WERE ACTUALLY GOING TO TAKE ISSUE TWELVE UP. AT THIS MOMENT WHEN YOU'RE READY ASSEMBLY MEMBER. OKAY WELL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY. BE HERE TODAY TO PRESENT IDEAS THAT COULD HELP THE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES. IDENTIFYING REPORT SERVICE GAPS FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. EVER SINCE I BEGAN MY CAREER AS A SPECIAL ED TEACHER. I'VE BEEN PASSION ABOUT HOW WE CAN BETTER SERVE THE NEEDS OF INDIVIDUALS PUT. DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. CURRENTLY DDS COLLECTION REPORTS A GREAT DEAL OF INFORMATION ABOUT CONSUMERS SUCH AS CASELOAD AGE. QUALIFYING DIAGNOSIS. RAGE I'M SORRY RACE ETHNICITY. LANGUAGE METAPHYSICAL HEALTH STATUS AND REGION AND MANGA AMONG OTHER THINGS. DDS ALSO HAS INFORMATION ABOUT VENDORS SUCH AS THE NUMBER PROVIDERS WITH EACH SERVICE CATEGORY. AMOUNT OF EXPENDITURES BY VENDOR AND THEIR LOCATION. WHAT SEEMS TO BE MISSING IS A CLEAR AND EASILY REPORT OF A LINK BETWEEN THE TWO? WHICH IS NEEDED TO IDENTIFY SERVICE GAPS FOR EXAMPLE. WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT SERVICE CATEGORIES HAVE PROBLEMS WITH DTS CLIENTS OBTAINING ACCESS TO SERVICES. NOR DO WE HAVE DATA TO KNOW WHICH REGIONS HAVE PROBLEMS WITH ACCESS. IN MY AREA ACCESS TO APPROPRIATE TRANSPORTATION IS SHE IS A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE. WITHOUT DOUBT WE CANNOT IDENTIFY THE ROOT CAUSE OF SERVICE CAPS. A GOOD FIRST STEP IN BETTER UNDERSTANDING THE MISSING LINK BETWEEN DOUBT ABOUT CONSUMERS AND VENDORS. WOULD BE FOR STATUTES. TO DIRECT THE CONVENING OF A WORKGROUP COMPROMISED OF DDS STAFF LEGISLATIVE STAFF. REGIONAL CENTER STAFF AND STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING SERVICE PROVIDERS CONSUMERS AND FAMILIES. THE WORKGROUP WOULD DEVELOP A PLAN FOR IMPROVING DDS DATA COLLECTION. PROCESSES IN AN EFFORT TO BETTER IDENTIFY QUANTIFY SERVICE GAPS AT THE ROOT CAUSES. THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE WOULD BE TO MORE EFFECTIVELY USE DATA TO INFORM THE ADMINISTRATION A SISTER LEGISLATIVE DECISION MAKING ABOUT FUNDING. THIS GROUP COULD WORK IN CONCERT WITH THE A DS TASK FORCE. HOWEVER THE SCOPE OF THIS NEW WORKGROUP WOULD BE BROADER NATURE. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENTED DAY AND I HOPE THE COMMITTEE WILL CONSIDER THIS REQUEST GO FORWARD THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM THE DIRECTOR IF YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS OR. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ANOTHER. THOUGHT I'D JUST LIKE TO SAY THAT. WITH THE THE WORK OF THE DS TASK FORCE AND AND CERTAINLY THE. THINGS THAT WE'VE HEARD TODAY AS FAR AS ASSESSING THE GAPS IN SERVICES IT'S AN AREA THAT WE CONTINUE TO. WELCOME INPUT AND. WELCOME DISCUSSION THANK YOU. YOU. SONYA PARTICULARLY. THIS IS AN ISSUE ON WHICH WE AGREE WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER LACKEY. IT'S. ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE TO LINK WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT CONSUMERS. WITH WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT SERVICE PROVIDERS TO MORE SYSTEMATICALLY AND OBJECTIVELY IDENTIFY GAPS IN RELATED UNMET FUNDING REQUIREMENTS. A LOT OF THE CURRENT EFFORTS WHILE THEY HAVE A LOT OF MERIT AND REMAIN VERY IMPORTANT. THEIR MORE. ANECDOTAL AND DEPENDED ON WHO SPEAKS UP. IT WE THINK IT WOULD BE REALLY IMPORTANT TO HAVE A WAY TO ADDRESS THESE SERVICE GAPS ON I'M. IN A MORE SYSTEMATIC WAY THERE MAY BE. THE OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT SOME IN OF ABOUT. WAYS TO. UMKC TO GATHER AND COMPILE THEM DATA FOR THIS EFFORT THIS WOULD REALLY I THINK AID BOTH STRIPPED THE DEPARTMENT AND THE LEGISLATURE IN. MAKING SPENDING DECISIONS. COULD YOU. THE PUBLIC COMMENT ON THE ISSUE TWELFTH. AS CHAIR MEMBERS SAID RECALLING TRIPS AND ARC ASSOCIATION REGIONAL CENTER AGENCIES WHO WANT THANK MISTER LACKEY AGAIN FOR SINCERE ATTEMPT TO TRY TO HELP. IN GATHERING IMPORTANT DATA FOR US TO FILL A FIGURE OUT OUR AND UNMET NEEDS AND SERVICE GAPS IN THE SYSTEM AND LOOK FOR TO WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT MIST MISTER LACKEY THIS. COMMITTEE IN THE LEGISLATURE AND NOT PURSUING THIS INITIATIVE THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR. HI MICHELLE HEIGHT OF A BOARD CERTIFIED BEHAVIOR ANALYSTS PROVIDER AND A PARENT AND I WOULD JUST LIKE TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER LACKEY FOR BRINGING THIS. I'M TO THE COMMITTEE'S ATTENTION AND BEING SUCH A VOCAL ADVOCATE FOR THE DISABILITY COMMUNITY HAS REALLY APPRECIATE IT AND I HOPE THAT YOU CONSIDER THE REQUEST THANK YOU. BECAME. PHONE THIS CHAIR MEMBERS JORDAN TO THE OUR CAN YOU SEE P.. AGAIN JUST WANNA.

THE DEPARTMENT AND THE LEGISLATURE IN DOING SO THANK THANK YOU. HELLO KEVIN WRATH MANOS CRA IT'S YES A LAN. WE'VE ADVOCATED FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS FOR A SEVERAL YEARS AT THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER LACKEY FOR YOUR CONCERN A WE BELIEVE THAT CREATING. A DATABASE OF VENDORS. IS THE WAY TO GO WE HOPE THAT. THE DEPARTMENT WILL A LOOK AT THIS AD THAT WOULD AT THAT WOULD ADDRESS THE ISSUES BUT IT WOULD ALSO ADDRESS. WHAT WHAT SERVICES AND NEED TO BE DEVELOPED IN WHICH AREAS BECAUSE YOU COULD JUST SAY FOR EACH FOR EACH EACH VENDOR COULD HAVE A SMALL HOME PAGES SAY? THIS IS THE SERVICES WE PROVIDE THESE ARE THE. THESE ARE THE CERTAINTIES OF THE SERVICE BECAUSE THAT WERE ACCEPTING NEW CLIENTS ON. THESE OF THE CULTURAL COMPETENCIES THAT WE HAVE THESE OF THE LANGUAGES THAT WE SPEAK FOR THE SERVICES WE COULD WE COULD ADDRESS THAT POS DISPARITY ISSUE. AND A LOT OF OTHER ISSUES TO A VENDOR DATABASE AND ENHANCE CONSUMER CHOICES I'VE BEEN A PARENT CONFERENCES WHERE THEY'VE ASKED FOR THESE KIND OF THINGS. I'M ASSUME AND THIS THIS THAT THIS TECHNOLOGY IS A DECADE OLD SO I THINK WE CAN DO IT NOW THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR. PAGE EIGHTEEN CALIFORNIA DISABILITY SERVICES ASSOCIATION TO TWENTY THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER LACKEY FOR BRING THIS ITEM TO THE TABLE WERE CERTAINLY IN SUPPORT OF ANY ANY EFFORTS TO BRING MORE DATA INTO THE SYSTEM AND WE SPOKE EARLIER ABOUT SOME THE REACH CHALLENGES WERE FACING SOME. THANKS MUCH. SEEING NO FURTHER COMMENT I'LL BRING IT BACK UP TO THE DYESS AND SEEING THAT WE HAVE NO QUESTIONS I WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER LACKEY FOR THIS PROPOSAL WILL. HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN TICKET SAYING THAT WE HAVE ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER HERE I'D LIKE TO BRING THEM UP FOR ISSUE ELEVEN. NO. EVEN. WHEN YOUR INTEREST. MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT FOR YOU TODAY. IN MY SIX YEARS IS AN ASSEMBLY MEMBER THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I PRESENTED BEFORE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE SO YOU KNOW IT MEANS SOMETHING TO ME. THE TOPIC I'M HERE TO DISCUSS IS ONE THAT REQUIRES THE COMMITTEE'S CONSIDERATION IN THE LEGISLATURE'S ACTION. I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST A REASONABLE APPROPRIATION OF FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO EXPAND EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED INDIVIDUALS. WE MUST NOT LEAVE ANYONE BEHIND. THIS MODEST INVESTMENT WILL HELP DESERVING INDIVIDUALS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. CIVIC COOLEY IT WILL GO TOWARD IMPLEMENTING COMMUNITY VOCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT SERVICES. THAT WILL EMPOWER THOSE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES TO ATTAIN BETTER UP EMPLOYMENT. WE KNOW THAT STEADY EMPLOYMENT GREATLY ENRICHES ALL OF OUR LIVES. INDIVIDUALS IN COMMUNITY WORK SETTINGS CAN CONFIDENCE AND HAVE A HIGHER QUALITY OF LIFE. THEY CONTRIBUTE TO THEIR LOCAL ECONOMY PAY TAXES AND REYES RELIED LESS ON. PUBLIC MONEY. CURRENTLY INDIVIDUALS WITH DD ARE RESTRICTED IN THEIR OPPORTUNITIES. FOUR YEARS AGO THE LEGISLATURE RECOGNIZED THE MERIT OF EXTENDING UP IMPLEMENT OPPORTUNITIES TO INDIVIDUALS WITH DD ONE AMP APPROVED S. B. FIVE SEVENTY SEVEN. UNFORTUNATELY S. B. FIVE SEVENTY SEVEN WAS NOT IMPLEMENTED DUE TO PURE BUREAUCRATIC RESTRICTIONS. EXPERTS WHO FOLLOW ME WILL EXPLAIN THIS IN DETAIL. MY COLLEAGUES IN TWENTY THIRTEEN THE LEGISLATURE CLEARLY STATED THAT COMPETITIVE EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES SHALL AND I WILL REPEAT SHALL BE REGALED IN THE HIGHEST PRIORITY. FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES REGARDLESS OF THE SEVERITY OF THEIR DISABILITIES AND THROUGH THE EMPLOYMENT FIRST POLICY. WE AND GOVERNOR BROWN NEED TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO THE PROMISES WE MADE THE DD POPULATION. I'VE ALWAYS SAID PROMISES MADE SHOULD BE PROMISES KEPT. WE NEED TO INVEST IN THIS UNDERSERVED POPULATION. LET ME TODAY'S WILL SANFORD EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF FUTURES EXPLORED AND BARRY JORDANIAN GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA'S DISABILITY SERVICE ASSOCIATION TO ELABORATE FURTHER ON THIS PROGRAM AND ITS BENEFITS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION THANK YOU AND WELCOME TO A BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE. I'LL BE BACK WITH. GREAT THAT THAT YOU MISTER CHAIR BAY JUTTING CDSA THINK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER FOR YOUR CONSTANT TENSION ON THIS YOU KNOW AND I'M JUST GONNA TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE BACKSTORY OF THESE COMMUNITIES VOCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT SERVICES AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER TOUCHED ON THIS WITH A PILOT PROGRAM. THAT WAS CHAPTER DONE SIGNED BACK IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN THAT ONE TENER PAVLEY WAS HERE UNFORTUNATELY WAS NEVER IMPLEMENTED. BECAUSE AS A PILOT PROGRAM IT WASN'T ELIGIBLE FOR EACH CBS WEAVER FUNDING. I BECAUSE IT WASNT AVAILABLE THROUGHOUT THE STATE. UP AT WHEN WE WHEN WE DISCOVER THAT LAST YEAR WE APPROACH THEM WITH MEMBER FRAZIER GRACIOUSLY OFFER OFFER TO AUTHOR AB SIXTY NO SEVEN WHICH GOT THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS WITH ABSOLUTE AL UNIBODY NO NO VOTES GOT TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK. BEFORE HE VETOED IT SAYING WELL IT HAS MERIT THIS BELONGS IN THE BUDGET DISCUSSION SO HERE WE ARE FOR COMPLETE WE'RE BACK AND AT AT THIS POINT WHERE WE'RE REALLY. LOOKING TO EXPAND AS AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER SAID EXPLAINABLE EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES IN SOME OF THE PRE EMPLOYMENT. OF VOCATIONAL SERVICES THAT PEOPLE NEED IN ORDER TO GET INTO COMPETITIVE INTEGRATE EMPLOYMENT. I LEAVE IT TO WILL TO DESCRIBE SOME OF THE PARTICULARS BUT ULTIMATELY IT'S ABOUT GIVING PEOPLE THE OPPORTUNITY. TO ACHIEVE COMPETITIVE INNOVATIVE EQUIPMENT AND FOR THOSE IN CERTAIN SETTINGS TO START TRANSITION INTO MORE COMPETITIVE IMMIGRANT EMPLOYMENT. GOTTA GET THE EASY PART OF IT WILL SAN FOR WHAT FEATURES EXPLORED. THE GOAL OF THIS RELEASE OF FIGURE OUT A WAY THAT WE CAN DO ACT WITH THE LEGISLATURE OFFERED. THREE B. X. TWO ONE WHAT'S PAID INTERNSHIP PROGRAM WHICH AN OPPORTUNITY FOR FOLKS TO BE PAID WALLY DO INTERNSHIPS IN THE COMMUNITY. MANY DAYS SERVICES WANT TO DO THAT BUT THIRD OF ONE TO THREE ONE TO FOUR ONE SIX RATIO. THEY HAVE NO WAY TO STAFF ITS SUPPORT BESTTHIS OPTION WOULD PROVIDE SOMEONE WANTS SERVICES THAT COULD BE USED TO HELP SUPPORT PEOPLE. GET OUT IN THE COMMUNITY DO THE PAGAN WORSHIP GAIN THAT VOCATIONAL EXPERIENCE SO THAT WAS A BIG PART OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO. BETTER AS WE KNOW THAT THE HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED SETTINGS RULES COMING. WE NEED TO FIND MORE WAYS INTEGRATOR FOLKS INTO THE COMMUNITY THIS TO BE ANOTHER WAY TO HELP PROGRAM SORT OF FIND DIFFERENT WAYS TO GET PEOPLE INVOLVED AND ACTIVE IN THE COMMUNITY IDEAL INDEPENDENT IMPLEMENT. THAT MAYBE OTHER OPPORTUNITIES ALSO THE OTHER PIECE WE PUT INTO THIS IS WE KNOW THAT WORK ACTIVITYPROGRAMS IS A SERVICE. ARE CLEARLY IN THE CROSSHAIRS OF SEGREGATED SERVICES THAT WILL PROBABLY GO AWAY. THESE ARE FOLKS WHO WANT TO WORK WHO HAVE BEEN WORKING MANY FOR THIRTY FORTY YEARS. BUT WE NEED A WAY TO HELP THEM GET ACROSS THE BARRIER. AND WHAT OUR OPTIONS ARE THERE'S WE ACTUALLY PROPOSED AT TAYLOR DAYS SERVICE AS NOT IN LIEU OF SERVICES BUT IT'S CONJUNCTION ON A SMALL SCALE TO HELP THEM MOVE TO COMPETITIVE NB IMPLEMENTS A LEADING TO MORE SEGREGATED SHELTERED EMPLOYMENT. TO MORE COMMUNITY BASED EMPLOYMENT SO IS REALLY THE FOCUS IS HOW CAN WE MOVE PEOPLE TO TO HAVE THOSE OPPORTUNITIES CROSS THE REALLY LARGE GAP FROM A. SEGREGATED SETTING TO A MUCH MORE COMMUNITY BASED SETTING. WITHOUT A LOT OF SUPPORT OPTION SO THAT WAS REALLY THE FOCUS OF THE EFFORT AND WE AGAIN THANK SOMEONE ARE FRAZIER BOTH AUTHOR BILL LAST AND THEN BRING IT BACK. THE BUDGET PROCESS. THANK YOU NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM THE CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR YOU HAVE A COMMENT FOLLOWED BY LEN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. ON WE APPRECIATE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRASIER'S UP PROPOSAL AND AS WAS NOTED. THE ADMINISTRATION. DOES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THESE SERVICES HAVE MERIT. HOWEVER WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSED DOLLAR AMOUNT. AND WHEN THE DEPARTMENT DID ITS ANALYSIS OF AB SIXTY NO SEVEN NO QUESTION HARD NUMBERS WERE PROBABLY ON THE HIGH SIDE THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT. BUT I THINK WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS THAT THIS FIVE MILLION DOLLAR ESTIMATE MAYBE ON THE LOW SIDE. ON WE ITS IT FOCUSES ON TAYLOR DAY SERVICES AS. BUT MR SANFORD MENTIONED AND. ONLY EIGHT REGIONAL CENTERS USE THOSE SERVICES SO WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS THAT THIS NUMBER MAY BE LOW. AND THAT. THE PROBLEM THAT IT COULD CREATE IS THAT BECAUSE. OUR SERVICES ARE PART OF AN ENTITLEMENT PROGRAM. IF MORE IF A IF A NUMBER IS LOW IT COULD CREATE PROBLEMS DOWN THE ROAD. IS THERE A MORE ACCURATE NUMBER THAT YOU WOULD RECOMMEND THAT. WOULD BE. AND WE DON'T HAVE A REVISED ESTIMATE AT THIS POINT NOW. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HELLO. NOW WILL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE ELEVEN.

WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE ELEVEN OPEN AND THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER FOR BRINGING THANK FOR CONSIDERATION PATRICIA THINK. WITH THAT WE WILL MOVE ON TO ISSUE FIVE JUST CONFIRMING RUN ISSUE FIVE. CORRECT. WE WILL NOW GO SEQUENTIALLY. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR LIKE TO INTRODUCE BRIAN WHEN FILLED. THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF A COMMUNITY SERVICES DIVISION THAT WILL PROVIDE A BRIEF OVERVIEW FOR YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING I'LL PROVIDE YOU WITH AN OVERVIEW OF THE DEPARTMENTS OVERSIGHT OF DISPARITY FUNDING SO THAT AB EX TWO ONE PROVIDES THE DEPARTMENT WITH THE METHOD ELEVEN MILLION DOLLARS. CHIU. AWARD CHIU A REGIONAL CENTERS AND THIS YEAR THAT WAS EXPANDED TO ALSO INCLUDE CANADA BASED ORGANIZATIONS. FOR I PROPOSALS THAT THEY SUBMIT TO THE DEPARTMENT THAT THEY IMPLEMENT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WITHIN EACH REGIONAL CENTER CATCHMENT AREA. TO ADDRESS DISPARITIES THAT STATE THAT ARE IN EACH OF THEIR AREAS. SO LAST YOU WE APPROVE NINETY SIX PROPOSALS FROM REGIONAL CENTERS. AND AS I MENTIONED BEFORE THIS YEAR IT WAS THAT EXPANDED TO INCLUDE COMMITTEE BASED ORGANIZATIONS. THAT APARTMENT RECEIVED. HUNDRED AND FORTY PROPOSALS TOTALING OVER TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AND WE WERE ABLE TO APPROVE SIXTY SIX OF THOSE PROPOSALS THIRTY FIVE OF THOSE WENT TO JUNIOR. COMMITTEE BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND THIRTY ONE OF AWARDS WERE FOR REGIONAL CENTERS TWENTY FOUR OF THOSE BEING FOR CONTINUING PROJECTS FROM FISCAL YEAR SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN. THE DEPARTMENT HAS SCORED THE PROPOSAL'S WITH THAT TEAM OF HAVE INDIVIDUALS WHO USE THAT THAT APART AND. DEPARTMENT OF REHABILITATION WAS REPRESENTED AND DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA WAS ALSO REPRESENTED AND SCORING THE PROPOSALS. AND FOR THE DEPARTMENT. I'D ALSO LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF WORKING WITH EACH OF THE ENTITIES UPON THE MEASURES THAT WILL BE USED TO. TO. LOOK AT THE PROGRESS AT EACH OF THESE PROPOSALS MAKES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL SENSE AT SOME OF THE PROS PROPOSALS ARE THINGS LIKE OUTREACH THE LOCAL COMMUNITY. TRAINING AND PROMO TORAS MODELS WE'RE WORKING WITH THOSE ORGANIZATIONS TO DETERMINE HOW THEY WILL. LOOK AT SUCCESS OF THESE PROJECTS. I'D ALSO LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT THE SENATE HUMAN SERVICES COMMITTEE LAST YEAR REQUESTED THAT THE DEPARTMENT PREPARE A PLAN ON HOW IT WOULD ADDRESS DISPARITIES. AND TO THE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS CAN'T ON THE OUTCOMES THAT DEPARTMENT WILL USE TO DETERMINE THE PROGRESS IS BEING MADE. AND KEY AREAS WITHIN THE PURCHASE OF REGIONAL CENTER SERVICES. SO WITH THAT. HOW STOP WITH DISPARITIES? THANK YOU. TIME THAT RESPITE. PLEASE. SO I IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE DURING THE BUDGET CRISIS ONE OF THE COST SAVING MEASURES WAS A CAP ON THE AMOUNT OF REST BUT THE REGION CENTER COULD PURCHASE AT NINETY HOURS OF IN HOME RESPITE PER QUARTER. AND TWENTY ONE DAYS OF OUT OF HOME RESPITE PER YEAR. DOT CAP IN STATUTE ALSO HAD AN EXCEPTIONS PROCESS OR A. KEY SO THAT IF AN INDIVIDUAL NEEDED ADDITIONAL RESPITE THE REGIONAL CENTER COULD APPROVE IT. LAST YEAR TRAILER THE LANGUAGE LIFTED THE CAP ON RESPITE AND SO. I HAD FACT IN JANUARY FIRST OF THIS YEAR THAT CAPITAL EXISTS IN STATUTE. IN AUGUST OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE DEPARTMENT ISSUED A DIRECTIVE TO REGIONAL CENTERS TO. ASKED THEM TO CONDUCT OUTREACH TO THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO INFORM THEIR COMMUNITIES ABOUT THIS LEFT OF THE RESPITE CAP AND TO PAY PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO. MIGHT NOT TYPICALLY AVAIL THEMSELVES OF REGIONAL CENTER SERVICES WE ALSO REQUESTED THE REGIONAL CENTERS REVISED THE PURCHASE OF SERVICE POLICIES. TO REFLECT THIS CHANGE IN STATUTE REGIONAL CENTERS USED THEIR POLICIES TO PROVIDE SOME PRIDE PARAMETERS AROUND THE SERVICES THAT THEY PROVIDE. SAID DEPARTMENT IS CURRENTLY REVIEWING REGIONAL CENTERS PURCHASE OF SERVICE POLICIES AND THE LAW REQUIRES THE DEPARTMENT TO APPROVE THOSE POLICIES PRIOR TO IMPLEMENTATION. THAT POLICIES MUST INCLUDE AND EXCEPTIONS PROCESS SO THAT IF THERE ARE ARE EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES THAT HOW FALL OUTSIDE OF THOSE PARAMETERS THAT THE REGIONAL CENTER HAS ESTABLISHED. THAT THROUGH THE PLANNING TEAM PROCESS THE REGIONAL CENTER WILL WILL CONSIDER THOSE EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES AND CAN GRANT. EXCEPTIONS TO ADD THE AMOUNT OF HOUSE AND HOME OR OUT OF A RESTAURANT THAT THEY PROVIDE. THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR. NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM. THAT KATIE HORNBERGER. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND AND AS I RECOGNIZE THE TIME I WILL TALK FAST WHICH I'M GOOD AT. UP ASSUME WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE DEPARTMENT'S EFFORTS ON IN BOTH ON ENSURING THAT MEASURABLE OUTCOMES. OR ACHIEVED ON I'M AND THINK THAT THEY'RE VERY MUCH ON THE RIGHT TRACK IN THAT REGARD I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE. THOSE ON MEASURES PUBLICLY ON STATED IN A PUBLIC FORUM DOWN IN A WAY THAT WE CAN BOTH FOUND REPLICATE THINGS THAT WORK AND STOP DOING AND STOP SPENDING MONEY ON THINGS THAT DON'T. ANSWER PROVIDING THAT IN A PUBLIC FORUM I THINK IS AN IMPORTANT STEP TOWARD THAT. IN TERMS OF SPENT ON ONE OF THE THINGS THAT. WE HAVE DISCOVERED IN THE COURSE OF ARE ADVOCACY IS THAT IN ADDITION TO PURCHASE OF SERVICE POLICIES. REGIONAL CENTERS ALSO HAVE INTERNAL PROTOCOLS ARE GUIDELINES THAT THEIR SERVICE COORDINATORS USED TO MAKE DECISIONS PARTICULARLY AROUND RESPITE. FROM WE HAVE SEEN A FEW OF THOSE PROTOCOLS HOWEVER IT SOME REGIONAL CENTERS WHEN WE'VE ASK FOR THEM THEY HAVE REFUSED TO GIVE THEM TO US ON. STATING THAT THEY ARE NOT REQUIRED TO UNDER ANY LAW. AND. I WOULD ENCOURAGE ON THE DEPARTMENT ON AND THE LEGISLATURE TO LOOK ALSO AT THOSE POLICY IT VIA PROTOCOLS AND GUIDELINES NOT JUST THE PURCHASE OF SERVICE POLICIES. ON MANY OF THEM. STILL CONTAIN A A CAP AND ON THE. CONTAIN AN ASSESSMENT TOOL THAT DON IS NOT NECESSARILY MADE ON PUBLIC SO FAMILIES CANNOT AVAIL THEMSELVES OF THAT TOOL TO BETTER PREPARE FOR THAT PLANNING PROCESS. BOB LIKE. REALLY ON ENCOURAGE EVERYONE TO HAVE THOSE ON PROCEDURES MADE PUBLIC ON IN AN EFFORT TOWARD TRANSPARENCY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. BERMAN A FINANCE ELLIOTT. ANY PUBLIC COMMENTS ON THE ISSUE FIVE. HELLO IT'S ME AGAIN AND I HAVE ON OF WEARING MY CALIFORNIA REST ASSOCIATION HAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR MOVING THE CAP. THAT WAS DEVASTATING. AND. WE USE TO I MEAN FOR THE CAP WE GOT. PROBABLY USED TO GET ABOUT SIXTY HOURS SEVENTY HOURS. A MONTH. FOR CLIENTS HOME IN SO. SO IT'S IT'S GREAT TO SEE THAT THE OPPORTUNITIES THERE TO INCREASE RESPITE SINCE WEST IS SO EFFECTIVE AND SAVES THE STATE SO MUCH MONEY IN PROVIDES. SO MUCH SUPPORT FOR FAMILIES. A AND THAT AND OF COURSE THE CLIENTS THAT WE SERVE. COUPLE THINGS ARE. WE'D ARM. WE LIKE WILL CLEAR POLICIES WOULD LIKE THEM PUBLISHED. CALIFORNIA REST ASSOCIATION WOULD LIKE A COPY. WE LIKE THEM PUBLISHED AS WE HEAR FROM OUR BY ASSOCIATION MEMBERS THAT. THAT FAMILIESARE CONFUSED. THEY DON'T KNOW ABOUT IT. AND THIS ISN'T LIKE US THEY'RE NOT NOBODY'S TRYING TO KEEP A SECRET RIGHT IT'S JUST WE GOT TO GET OUR ACT TOGETHER ON THE STUFF I'M. AND THEN I'M ONE OF THE WHERE THE MOST. CONFUSING THINGS THAT WE'D LIKE CLARIFIED IN WHEN AS AS THE DEPARTMENT WITH VIEWS POLICIES IS. IS THERE SOME KIND OF TRADE OFF YOU KNOW IF YOU GET. A BUNCH MORE. RESPITE YOU CAN'T GET OUT OF HOME RESPITE. WE'VE SEEN. FAMILIES. WE'VE HEARD JUST ANSWER TOTAL STUFF THERE'S NOT ENOUGH DATA OF COURSE BUT I'M WE'VE HEARD PEOPLE SAY GOSH YOU KNOW NOW WE CAN'T HAVE ANY OUT OF HOME RESPITE BECAUSE WE GOT A BUNCH OF IN HOUSE IN HOME RESPITE. SO SO JUST TO CLARIFY THAT AND SO THE PARENTS AND CASE MANAGERS KNOW THAT TOO. THAT AND WE WE WE HOPE THAT INCREASING RESPITE DOESN'T MEAN IN HOME RESPITE DOESN'T MEAN DECREASING OUT OF HOME RESPITE. AND THAT THERE SOME CAP SOME TOTAL CAP BETWEEN IN HOME IN OUT OF HOME RESPITE FOR EACH CLIENT. WE WE DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT TO BE THE CASE AND WE WOULD REQUEST. THAT. BE ON. THERE BE. GUIDELINES PUBLISHED GUIDELINES AND THAT WOULD BE THE GUIDELINES FOR THE CASE MANAGERS AND THAT THERE NOT BE. PUBLIC GUIDELINES AND THEN SECRET IN HOUSE GUIDELINES RIGHT. WHERE WE'RE AT THAT CONTRADICT OR SOMEHOW SUBVERT THE PUBLIC GUIDELINES SO WE LIKE THERE TO BE? NO PROTOCOLS INSIDE REGIONAL CENTER FOR CASE MANAGERS EXCEPT THE PUBLIC GUIDELINES THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU SIR. JORDAN INTO THE OUR COMMUNITY PEEING A THREE QUICK THINGS OR ONE REGARDING THE RESPITE THE COMMUNITIES INCREDIBLY GRATEFUL THAT THAT WAS A RESTORED AND WE pRECORDS LET'S THAT LEGISLATURE. IN THE NEXT YEAR INTO IN THE DEPARTMENT TO MAKE SURE THAT ACTUALLY PEOPLE ARE NOW UTILIZING IT MORE. AS IT IS A CRITICAL SERVICE IN THE COMMUNITY A NUMBER TWO REGARDING THE RACIAL DISPARITIES WE HAVE TO CONTINUE AS I KNOW OTHER CHAIR IN THIS COMMITTEE WILL TO CONTINUE TO KEEP A CLOSE EYE ON THAT AND MAKE THAT A TOP PRIORITY. WE THE LEGISLATURE HAS APPROVED A A GOOD CHUNK OF CHANGE FOR GRANTS TO BOTH THE LAST OF THE REGIONAL CENTER. AND THIS YEAR REAL CENTER INCOMING PROVIDERS TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO MAKE AND IN IN IN MAKING A DENT IN THIS DISPARITY WE ENCOURAGE LEGISLATURE TO. WATCH THAT CLOSELY IS IT WORKING WHAT ARE THOSE DOLLARS GOING FOR IT IS ACTUALLY MOVING THE NEEDLE AND. THE IT IF NOT THEN LET'S JUST. FINALLY. REGIONAL CENTERS AND THANKS TO YOUR REQUIREMENTS REPORT DISBANDED AT THE RACIAL PURCHASER PURCHASERS IS BASED ON. MANY FACTORS INCLUDE RACE AND ETHNICITY. HOWEVER IT'S NOT UNIFORM BETWEEN RITUAL CENTERS AND JUST IN TERMS OF EVALUATED AND TRYING TO COMPARE APPLES TO APPLES MAKES IT DIFFICULT IT WOULD BE REALLY. A IT WOULD BE APPRECIATE IF THERE'S SOME WAY THAT WE CAN MAKE THAT MORE UNIFORM BETWEEN ALL THE UNIFORM. ALL REGIONAL CENTERS REPORTING UP SPECIFIC TO THAT THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON EVENING. MY NAME IS AMY WESTLING I'M FROM ARQUEBUSES SHIZHEN OF REGIONAL CENTER AGENCIES FIRST AND FOREMOST I WANT TO. ACKNOWLEDGE THE LEGISLATURE FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND. HELPING US TO RESTORE THE RESPITE HAD LAST YEAR. IT WAS SOMETHING THAT OUR COMMUNITY SORELY NEEDED AND WE WERE PROUD TO PARTNER WITH DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA IN OUR ADVOCACY EFFORTS ON THAT. CRITICAL RESTORATION. IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT REGIONAL CENTERS PROVIDE NEED SPACE SERVICES. AND SO OF COURSE THERE HAS TO BE A WAY TO DETERMINE NEED. THAT ONE OF THE MOST CHALLENGING THINGS THAT SERVICE COORDINATORS MUST DO IS HELP TO DIFFERENTIATE NEED PURSES WANT. AND THE THINGS THAT REGIONAL CENTERS CONSIDER WHEN THEY LOOK AT A FAMILY'S RESPITE NEEDS ARE THE INDIVIDUAL SELF CARE SKILLS THEIR MEDICAL NEEDS THEIR BEHAVIORAL SUPPORT NEEDS. THE FAMILY DYNAMICS AND COMPOSITION THE INDIVIDUALS DAILY SCHEDULE ALL OF THESE THINGS PLAY INTO HOW MANY HOURS THERE ARE IN A DAY AND HOW WHAT'S THE TRUE NEED FOR RESPITE. ADDITIONALLY ONE OF THE JOBS OF A REGIONAL CENTER SERVICE COORDINATOR. IS TO. TEASE OUT WHAT EXACTLY A FAMILY IS ASKING FOR. IF FOR INSTANCE SOMEONE ASKS FOR TWO HUNDRED OF HOURS A MONTH OF RESPITE AND THE SERVICE COORDINATOR DRILLS DOWN A LITTLE DEEPER AND FIND OUT IT'S SO MOM AND DAD CAN GO TO WORK. THAT'S NOT RESPITE THAT'S DAYCARE BUT WE KNOW THAT OFTEN TIMES PEOPLE WILL ASK FOR SERVICES THAT THEY KNOW THE NAME OF. AND IT'S INCUMBENT UPON SERVICE COORDINATORS. AND THEY DO A FANTASTIC JOB WITH THIS TO DRILL DOWN AND FIGURE OUT EXACTLY WHAT IS THAT NEED AND WHAT IS THAT. WHERE IS THAT COMING FROM? AND SO WHILE THE RESTORATION OF RESPITE WAS A GREAT THING. WE NEED TO REMEMBER. THAT AT THE END OF THE DAY THE SERVICE IS ABOUT ENSURING THAT INDIVIDUALS AND THEIR FAMILIES HAVE THE SUPPORTS TO STAY TOGETHER. AND THAT THEIR NEEDS ARE MET THANK YOU. ACUMEN. SEEING NO. FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT I WILL BRING IT BACK UP TO THE DYESS FOR ANY COMMENTS YOU MAY HAVE. SEEING NONE. I'D LIKE TO MAKE A REQUEST A RESPONSE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES IN WRITING TO THE ISSUES. AND QUESTIONS RAISED BY DRC FOR BOTH THE DISPARITIES FUNDING. AND THE RESPITE RESTORATION BY THE END OF THIS MONTH FRIDAY MARCH THIRTIETH PLEASE. WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE FIVE OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE SIX. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR HIS NEXT ISSUE ARE IS THE ADMINISTRATION'S PUT PROPOSAL. TO RESTORE THE UNIFORM HOLIDAY SCHEDULE. IN TWO THOUSAND NINE TEN THE STATE WAS FACING A TWENTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR GENERAL FUND SHORTFALL. AND AND NUMBER OF GENERAL FUND SAVINGS PROPOSALS WERE PUT IN PLACE. TO REMEDIATE THAT SHORTFALL THIS IS ONE OF THOSE PROPOSALS. ON. WHAT THE PROPOSAL DID WAS IT AMENDED THE EXISTING STATUTE THAT CALLED FOR TEN? HOLIDAYS DURING THE YEAR THAT WERE TIED TO BASICALLY THE FEDERAL HOLIDAY SCHEDULE. IT ADDED FOR HOLIDAYS THE FOUR DAYS BETWEEN CHRISTMAS AND NEW YEARS. AT THAT TIME IT RESULTED IN THE GENERAL FUND SAVINGS OF SIXTEEN POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS. UPDATING THAT NUMBER TO. THOUGHT BASED ON OUR CURRENT CASELOAD EXPENDITURE NUMBERS WE WE THINK THAT THE SAVINGS. BY REINSTITUTING HIS PROPOSAL IS CLOSER TO NINETEEN POINT FIVE MILLION. AS NOTED IN THE AGENDA SERVICE PROVIDER ORGANIZATIONS BROUGHT A LAWSUIT AGAINST THE DEPARTMENT AND IT RESULTED A IN QUITE A BIT OF BACK AND FORTH BUT AT ONE POINT THERE WAS AN INJUNCTION PLACED ON THE DEPARTMENT FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SCHEDULE. THE US DISTRICT COURT. VACATED THAT INJUNCTION IN ON AUGUST OF TWENTY SIXTEEN. UGH THERE WAS AN APPEAL FILED BUT THE YEAH FEDERAL APPELLATE COURT UPHELD THE DISTRICT COURT DECISION IN MAY OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN. SO. WHAT THE DEPARTMENT IS NOW PROPOSING CONSISTENT WITH THE COURT'S RULING IS TO RE IMPLEMENT? STATUTE EFFECTIVE JULY FIRST OF TWENTY EIGHT TEN. THANK YOU. COME NEXT I'D LIKE TO HEAR FROM. JORDAN THEN AMY FOLLOWED BY KATIE AND IF WE COULD MAKE ROOM FOR A MINUTE SOMEWHERE THAT BE GREAT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN RESULT BE AS QUICK AS POSSIBLE. YEAH I I WANNA MAKE IT START BY SAYING HOW BLESSED WE ARE THAT WE'RE AT A COMMITTEE HEARING. AND WHAT'S NOT TWO THOUSAND AND I WORK EVERY SINGLE THING ON THE AGENDA AS A CUT. AND WE ARE AT A PLACE WHERE EVERY SINGLE THING ON THE AGENDA IS HOW WE CAN IMPROVE PEOPLE'S LIVES. EXCEPT THIS. WHY IS THIS HERE? THIS IS THE LEGACY CUT FROM THE RECESSION. AND ONE WHICH THE ARK CALIFORNIA ALONG WITH UCP SAN DIEGO ENTERED INTO LAWSUIT AGAINST THE CITY CALIFORNIA THE FEDERAL COURT. RULED IT AS A DIRECT CUT. SYSTEM THAT'S WHAT THEY SAID THE ONLY REASON WHY WE DIDN'T WIN IN COURT IS BECAUSE IN THE US SUPREME COURT SAID THE THIRD PARTIES NOW LONG NO LONGER HAVE STANDING. TWEEN. MEDICAID IN IN MEDICAID CASES THAT'S THE ONLY REASON WHY. SO ONE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A PROPOSAL WHICH IS A CUT SO THAT FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUALS DRUM DISABILITIES FOR DAYS. ADDITIONAL FOUR DAYS ARE LEFT TO FEND FOR THEMSELVES FOR CERTAIN SUPPORTS AND SERVICES. AND THAT WON'T BE PROVIDED. IT WILL CAUSE PEOPLE AND FAMILIES. TO HAVE TO MAY BE APPARENT TAKE DAYS OFF WORK OR AN INDIVIDUAL. HAVE TO SIT AT HOME THE WHOLE DAY AND ALSO IS A RATE CUT TO PROVIDERS WHO PROVIDING SUPPORTIVE LIVING SERVICES INDEPENDENT SERVICES BECAUSE THEY STILL HAVE TO PROVIDE. THE SERVICE IN THE HOME. SO THAT ADDITIONALLY THIS IS COSTING THE STATE IN THIS LAWSUIT IT'S IT'S SOMETHING WHICH IS NOT NEEDED IT'S A RECESSION ERICA. IN IT'S HARMING FAMILIES. IT. AN ADDITIONAL WERE ABOUT TO HEAR PROPOSAL ABOUT INCREASE TO. A HEADQUARTERS AT A TIME WHERE THERE'S ALSO PROPOSAL TO. CUT SERVICES AND SUPPORTS THE PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY I THINK THAT. FLAT OUT REJECTING THIS PROPOSAL IS WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR THE LA DID A GREAT JOB IN IN THEIR THREE. SUGGESTED OPTIONS HERE THEY ARE CAN YOU SEE PIECE. WOULD LIKE TO REQUEST THAT THE COMMITTEE ADOPT THE SECOND PROPOSAL THERE TO JUST FLAT OUT REJECT THIS THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR ALL OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR PATIENCE AS WE WORK THROUGH THESE CRITICAL ISSUES IN OUR SYSTEM. AS JORDAN NOTED THIS IS. ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT WAS AROUND DURING THE RECESSION THAT CAME BECAUSE EVERYONE. STATEWIDE IN LOTS OF STATE FUNDED SERVICES WERE BEING ASKED TO TAKE FURLOUGHS. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT A HOLIDAY WE NEED TO REMEMBER THESE ARE NOT PAID HOLIDAYS FOR SERVICE PROVIDERS. IT'S NOT PAID HOLIDAYS FOR DIRECT SERVICE. PROVIDERS OR THEIR STAFF. IT IS TIME OFF WORK WITHOUT PAY. BUT AGAIN LIKE WE BEEN CIRCLING BACK TO ALL DAY THIS IS ABOUT PROVIDING SERVICES THAT PEOPLE CRITICALLY NEED TO BE INTEGRATED INTO THEIR COMMUNITIES. WE KNOW THAT. DAYS SERVICES OFTENTIMES HELP PEOPLE TO BECOME EMPLOYED AND HELP PEOPLE TO MAINTAIN THE UNEMPLOYMENT. AND OFTENTIMES NGUYEN INDIVIDUALS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES ARE WORKING THE SAD TRUTH IS THAT THEY'RE WORKING IN LOW WAGE JOBS AND THEY CAN'T DICTATE THEIR OWN DAYS OFF. SO IF THERE SERVICE PROVIDERS CAN'T. BE PAID FOR THE DAYS THEY SUPPORT THEM FOR SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE FACED WITH EITHER. NOT SUPPORTING THEM AND THE PERSON LOSES THEIR EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY. OR SUPPORTING THEM IN THE SERVICE PROVIDER GOES WITHOUT PAY. WE DID A SURVEY OF THE REGIONAL CENTERS TO FIND OUT WHAT'S THE CURRENT STATE OUT THERE BECAUSE WE KEEP HEARING A LOT ABOUT. TEN DAYS IS THE NORM. WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT CURRENTLY SEVEN REGIONAL CENTERS ARE OPERATING UNDER A HOLIDAY SCHEDULE? WITH FIVE OF THOSE TAKING TEN DAYS A YEAR ONE TAKING NINE ONE TAKING TWELVE. BUT THE OTHER FOURTEEN CENTERS ARE ALL LETTING THEIR SERVICE PROVIDERS TELL THEM WHEN IT MAKES SENSE FOR THEM TO BE OFF. IF A SERVICE PROVIDER IS PROVIDING SERVICES. AND NOT IN AN EMPLOYMENT SETTING IT LIKELY WON'T MAKE SENSE FOR THAT PERSON FOR THAT PROVIDER TO BE OPEN ON CHRISTMAS DAY. BUT IF A SERVICE PROVIDER IS SUPPORTING SOMEONE WHO WORKS IN RETAIL. IT MAY MEAN THAT THEY REALLY DO NEED TO PROVIDE CRITICAL SUPPORTS ON THANKSGIVING. SO OUR CODE IS. JOINING WITH THE ARE CAN YOU SEE P. AND MANY MANY OTHER GROUPS IN ASKING FOR REJECTION OF THIS PROPOSAL. THANK YOU IF YOU. FOLLOW ALONG WITH WHAT AMY WAS SAYING ON THE CURRENT LAW EXEMPTS INDIVIDUALS WHO RECEIVE SUPPORTED WORK SERVICES HOWEVER HAS NOT BEEN UPDATED. TO INCLUDE INDIVIDUALS WHO WORK IN THE PAID INTERNSHIP PROGRAM OR THOSE THAT ARE ENGAGED IN COMPETITIVE INTEGRATIVE EMPLOYMENT WITH SUPPORTS. AND SO WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT OUR CONSUMERS WHO ARE IN INTERNSHIPS AND IN IN COMPETITIVE JOBS WHICH IS OUR ULTIMATE GOAL FOR PEOPLE. ON ARE NOT NEGATIVELY IMPACTED ON IN ANY WAY BY A HOLIDAY SCHEDULE ON. WE SORT OF ASSUME IT WAS NEVER THE DEPARTMENT'S INTENTION THAT THOSE ON ADDITIONAL SERVICES BE COVERED BY IT BUT BELIEVE THAT CLARIFICATION OF THE STATUTE WOULD ON ENSURE THAT THERE ARE NO UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. THANK YOU. NEXT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE NOEL. SONYA PADDICK ILIO. AND. WE KNOW THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS THREE OPTIONS ON THIS ISSUE IT CAN IMPROVE THE PURPOSE THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL CAN REJECTED OUTRIGHT OR IT COULD DO SOME KIND OF COMPROMISE WHERE IT APPROVES. AND A UNIFORM HOLIDAY POLICY BUT REDUCES THE NUMBER OF DAYS TO SAY TEN. AT THIS TIME WE'D LIKE TO JUST PROVIDE A BIT MORE CLARITY ON THE FISCAL IMPACT OF THESE VARIOUS OPTIONS SO. ONE THING TO KNOW IS THAT WHEN. IN TWENTY FIFTEEN THE DEPARTMENT QUIT IN FORCING THE YOU THE FOURTEEN DAY UNIFORM HOLIDAY POLICY SO IT'S NOT BEEN ENFORCED SINCE THAT TIME. WHAT THIS MEANS IS AS MS WAS LAYING? NOTED A LOT OF THE REGIONAL CENTERS HAVE EITHER GONE BACK TO. HOLIDAY POLICY OF TEN DAYS NINE DAYS OR TWELVE DAYS OR THEY DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC AND SET HOLIDAY POLICY. WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT EVEN THOUGH THE ADMINISTRATION DIDN'T PUT? URGENT REQUEST FUNDING TO PUT BACK IN THE BUDGET WHEN THEY QUIT ENFORCING THE POLICY IT MEANS THAT. SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE LIKELY BILLING FOR THESE SERVICES ON THOSE ADDITIONAL DAYS ON THE NATURAL. SO IF THE LEGISLATURE WERE TO. PROVE THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL WE AGREE WITH THE DEPARTMENT THAT THIS COULD RESULT IN SAVINGS NEXT YEAR OF CLOSE TO TWENTY MILLION GENERAL FUND. HOWEVER IF THE LEGISLATURE CHOSE TO REJECT THE POLICY WE THINK THAT THE ADDITIONAL COST A TWO TWO I'M. GO BACK TO TEN DAYS OR WHATEVER THE REGIONAL CENTERS WANTED TO DO WOULD ONLY COST ME ABOUT THREE MILLION. GENERAL FUND BECAUSE SERVICE PROVIDERS HAVE ALREADY BEEN DOING FOR THOSE DAYS THAT MAKES IT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. JAKE Y. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE OF. PUSHING BACK A LITTLE BIT ON THE LA US POSITION ON THIS I THINK WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT MANY OF THE REGIONAL CENTERS OF RETURN TO OF THEIR OWN. HOLIDAY SCHEDULE THERE REALLY ISN'T A UNIFORM ON A SCHEDULE IN PLACE CURRENTLY. BUT BECAUSE EACH OF THE REGIONAL CENTERS HAS BEEN BUILDING ON DIFFERENT DAYS AND THERE IS NO UNIFORMITY WE WOULD RECOMMEND THAT ANY CHANGE THIS PROPOSAL. WOULD BE RESTORED AS CUT SO BUILDING IN THE. FULL TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET YEAR TO ENSURE THAT. THE DEPARTMENT IS IN SHORT ON RESOURCES IN THE BUDGET HERE AND HAVE TO COME BACK AND MAKE AND. CORNER BUDGET REQUEST. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WILL NOT TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE SIX. RICK ROLLINS ON BEHALF OF ARKANSAS SHE SHOULD REVEAL CENTER AGENCIES AND IDEA. BAKER INDULGENCE OF MY BOSS AB DID A GREAT JOB IN HER PRESENTATION BUT THERE'S ONE THING I DID WANT TO ADD. AND THAT IS SO HIGH HIGH AS MANY OF YOU KNOW I AM A PARENT OF A SON WITH AUTISM. WHO RECEIVES REGIONAL CENTER SERVICES? IF THIS PROGRAM DOES GOING TO A. POLICY GOES INTO EFFECT OF HIM HIS DAY PROGRAM IS IMPACTED AND I'M TOLD I HAVE TO TAKE CARE MY SON WHILE I'M SUPPOSED TO BE AT A BUDGETS HAVE ONE HEARING. AT THE CAPITOL I'M GONNA CALL MY REGIONAL CENTER QUITE FRANKLY AND SAY HEY I NEED HELP. YOU NEED TO SEND PERSONAL ASSISTANTS WHICH BY THE WAY IT'S GOING TO COST YOU MORE THAN KEEPING MY DAY PROGRAM OPEN FOR THAT DAY. THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR. NANCY CHANCE CHOICES PERSON CENTERED SERVICES ON HERE IN OPPOSITION OF. THE REINSTATEMENT OF HOLIDAY SCHEDULE WILL. I MEAN WE NEED TO JUST SAY IT LIKE IT IS THIS IS A CUT TO A SYSTEM THAT YOU'VE JUST HEARD. THROUGHOUT THIS TESTIMONY TODAY IS ALREADY SUFFERING IS ALREADY STRUGGLING WITH ON PAYING THEIR FOLKS AND GETTING PEOPLE AND HOLDING ON TO. EMPLOYEES AND NOW WE'RE GONNA FURLOUGH THEM FOR FOUR MORE DAYS WITH NO PAY ON AND WE'RE GONNA SEND OUR GUYS THAT WERE SUPPORTING. HOME. TED FOR SOMEBODY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO WITH THEM AND I JUST THINK THAT'S. IT'S IT'S NOT NECESSARY RIGHT NOW. YOU KNOW WHERE ARE THE STRUGGLING LIKE WE SAID WITH THE MINIMUM WAGE. FROZEN FROZEN. RATES AND WITH RISING HEALTHCARE COSTS. AND IN ADDITION THIS PROPOSAL. AND THE QUITE FRANKLY ANY HOLIDAY SCHEDULE TO ME ISN'T IT ISN'T IT. COMP ON CONTRADICTION TO THE NEW HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES ROLE. BUT SAYS WE NEED TO BE PERSON CENTER WE NEED TO REACH SHOULDN'T BE DOING ANYTHING UNIFORMLY WE SHOULD BE OUT THERE DOING WHAT THE PERSON NEEDS. SO TO ME THIS IS IN CONTRADICTION TO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH HERE THROUGH THE THE TWO THROUGH H. CBS. AND FINALLY. IF WE CAN'T GET YOU TO FLATLY REJECT MAYBE WE COULD PUT IT OFF FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS TILL WE HAVE A RATE. STUDY BACK AND YOU KNOW DELAY IT DON'T INSTITUTE RIGHT NOW DELAY IT FOR A COUPLE YEARS TO WE HAVE THE RATE STUDY TO WE KINDA KNOW WHERE THAT WHERE WE'RE GOING TO BE GOING WITH RATES. AND THEN LOOK AT IT AGAIN BUT IF WE CAN FLATLY DENIED THAT BE GREAT. THE HUMAN. PARDEE EMOTO CALIFORNIA DISABILITY SENIOR COMMITTEE ACTION NETWORK ALSO A FAMILY MEMBER. I SUPPORT THE PREVIOUS COMMENTS ESPECIALLY FROM NANCY CHANCE AND ALSO THE THE PANEL UP UNDERSCORING ONE THING. GIVEN ALL THE ISSUES REGARDING. CUTS OVER THE PAST OF SEVERAL YEARS AND HOW PEOPLE HAVE BEEN HARMED. IMPOSING THIS REDUCTION NOW. IT IS SIMPLY UNFAIR AND THAT'S HOW IT NEEDS TO BE VIEWED IT AS THE SUN FAIR. AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE FACT HOW THE STATE VIEWS REQUEST FROM ADVOCATES OF. FOR ACROSS THE BOARD RATE INCREASES OR MORE RESOURCES NOT JUST FROM DEVELOPMENT SERVICES IN OTHER AREAS I JUST SAYS MEDI CAL. IN THE STATE'S RESPONSE IS A CAN'T. DO THESE THINGS ESPECIALLY IN DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES. ONE OF THE REASONS IS BECAUSE OF THE RATE STUDY. IT. GOING ON THAT LOGIC THOUGH IF YOU'RE NOT BEEN IMPOSED ACROSS THE BOARD RATE INCREASES OR FUNDING RESOURCES BECAUSE THERE IS A RATE STUDY. IN THE STATE OUT OF FAIRNESS SHOULD NOT BE IMPOSING AN ACROSS THE BOARD CUT. AND A ONE OF THE THINGS OUT WITH THE LA O. SHOOT THE THREE OPTIONS YOU CAME UP WITH THERE'S UP FOR ADOPTION THAT NANCY CHANCE JUST MENTIONED. WHICH IS RATHER IN THE REJECT IT COMPLETELY BECAUSE I KNOW LEGISLATURE DOESN'T LIKE TO DO CERTAIN THINGS ARE SO IF YOU KNOW DID. DEFINITIVE SOMETIMES SOMETIMES. MAYBE DELAY IT. A REINSTATEMENT FOR YEAR UNTIL THE RATE STUDY IS COMPLETED AND SEE IF SEE IF THIS EVEN MAKES SENSE IN THE SCHEME OF THINGS AND ALSO DOES IT MAKE SENSE OF THIS IS HOW WHAT THE STATE WANTS TO DO IN TERMS OF COMPLIANCE. OF HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES RULES THANK YOU. IF YOU WANNA GET CLOSER. THANK YOU. REMOVED. WHO? I NEED HELP. GOOD AFTERNOON I AM THEY CALLED US LAW FROM ANTIOCH IF THE FOR FORCED CLOSURE DAYS ARE IMPLEMENTED I WILL BE FORCED TO STAY HOME I WILL BE ISOLATED UNHAPPY AND WILL ONLY HAVE MY HOME CARE STAFF. TO SOCIALIZE WITH DR I AM NOT OUT IN THE COMMUNITY WITH MY PEERS AND CANNOT INTEGRATE WITH OTHERS I AM ALSO DENIED DISAPPOINTS TO WORK AND HELP OTHERS IN THE COMMUNITY THE CLOSURE DAYS WILL ALSO AFFECT. THE SUPPORT STAFF BY HAVING THEM TO WORK LAWYER DOCTOR STATE WILL HAVE TO PAY MORE IN THE LONG RUN BECAUSE OF THE EXTRA STAFFING NEEDED FOR THE HOME CARE GIVERS ALSO THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING. AT THE DAY AT WORK PROGRAMS WILL LOSE MONEY TO THEY CANNOT PAY THEIR BILLS SO THEY GO FIND MORE CONSISTENT EMPLOYMENT THIS LEADS TO A VERY HIGH TURNOVER RATE AND MAKES IT HARD. TO FIND GOOD QUALITY PEOPLE I HOPE YOU WILL CONSIDER THE PERSONAL IMPACT OF THESE FOR FORCED CLOSURES ON THE PEOPLE THAT USE AND NEED THE SERVICES TO LEAD A NORMAL AND SUCCESSFUL LIFE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MA'AM AND THANK YOU FOR BEING AN ADVOCATE. CARLENE HOLD WITH EASTER SEAL DITTO I CAN'T FOLLOW THAT SHE WAS SO ARTICULATE A GREAT JOB OF HER ARTICULATING THE ISSUES THANK YOU. THANK YOU. JAMIE DAVIS MORE ADVENTURES. I PAID ATTENTION ON THE GOVERNOR RELEASED THE BUDGET AND LISTEN IN TO. A PHONE CALL I THINK WAS DIANA DO WAY GOING OVER IT. PERHAPS NANCY. AND THAT ARE VERY FIRST I SAW THIS ARTICLE. CALIFORNIA'S COLLECTING SO MUCH OF YOUR MONEY IT CAN'T SAVE AT ALL. SO I HEAR THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE FOR ADDITIONAL DAYS IN WHICH OUR AGENCY WILL LOSE FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND MY STAFF WILL HAVE TO STAY HOME WITH NO PAY. AND I KNOW THIS ARTICLE IS ABOUT THE COMPLEXITY OF THE RAINY DAY FUND. BUT IMAGINE IF YOU WORK FOR A SMALL BUSINESS AND YOU FIND OUT. YOU'RE GETTING A PAY CUT.

WELL SEVERAL FEATURES EXPLORED I WAS HERE IN THOSE DARK DAYS I WAS IN THOSE DISCUSSIONS AND TWO THOUSAND NINE WHERE WE HAD TRYING CUT SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS WE DIDN'T QUITE IN THAT HAVEN'T GOT THAT MUCH BECAUSE I'M JUST UNDER FIVE HUNDRED. AND WE AGREED TO THE STATE EMPLOYEES WERE TAKING FOUR DAYS OFF. EVERYBODY ELSE WAS TAKEN FOR LOW SAID OKAY WE WILL OUR FOLKS ARE WILLING TO GIVE. ALL THOSE THINGS HAVE BEEN RESTORED. EXCEPT FOR US SO WHAT IS IT ABOUT THE NICOLES THE WORLD THAT SAYS THEY DON'T DESERVE TO HAVE A FULL LIFE LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE. SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT I BRING IT UP TO THE DYESS FOR ANY COMMENTS WE MAY HAVE. IT WOULD. S. REMOVED TWO I MOVED TO REJECT THIS ITEM. THE SECOND. I AM BEING NOTIFIED THAT. FOR US TO TAKE SPECIFIC ACTIONS WE HAVE TO. HAVE CERTAIN PROCEDURES IN PLACE. RON I WOULD LIKE TO SAY FOR THE SAKE OF A FULLER PICTURE OF THE OPTIONS ONLY. CAN FINANCE PLEASE PROVIDE THE SUBCOMMITTEE STAFF WITH WHAT WOULD BE THE COST IF ANY. OF ADOPTING A COMPROMISE OF A TEN DAY UNIFORM HOLIDAY SCHEDULE VIS A VIS WHAT THE GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED IN HIS BUDGET. WORK TO GET THAT TO YOUR STAFF GREAT. WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN AND I SEE SENATOR WILK HERE AND WE WILL MOVE ON TO ISSUE NOT. THEN ONE WOULD GET MAD IF I DIDN'T KNOW FEDERAL. THEN WE'VE GOT. TO HAVE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS IN AND THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR HARD WORK ON THIS COMMITTEE IS A VERY IMPORTANT COMMITTEE AND I REALLY. APPRECIATE THE WAY THAT YOU DO IN SUCH A THOUGHTFUL THOUGHTFUL MANNER. I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT I WANNA THANK YOU FIRST FOR JAN DIES IN THIS REQUEST WHICH CHANGES THE AGE OF ONSET DEFINITION OF DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY. FROM A DISABILITY THAT ORIGINATES BEFORE AGE EIGHTEEN TO ONE WHICH ORIGINATES BEFORE AGE TWENTY TWO. THIS CHANGE WILL CONFORM TO THE FEDERAL AGE OF ONSET DEFINITION WHICH WAS CHANGED ALMOST FORTY YEARS AGO. THIRTY STATES HAVE ALSO UPDATED THEIR AGE OF ONSET. A TO THE DEFINITION OF TWENTY TWO WHY. OUR BECAUSE MODERN SCIENCE AND UNANIMOUS MEDICAL CONSENSUS LONG AGO CONCLUDED THAT THE BRAINS DEVELOPMENT. DEVELOPMENT DEVELOPMENTAL PHASE IS NOT COMPLETED AGED EIGHTEEN BUT CONTINUES TO AT LEAST AGE TWENTY TWO. INDIVIDUALS MADE NEW NEWLY ELIGIBLE FOR DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY SERVICES AT BY THIS AGE OF ONSET WOULD BE ALMOST ENTIRELY WITHIN THE LANHAM ACT CATEGORY FIVE. QUOTE OTHER HANDICAPPING CONDITIONS FOUND TO BE CLOSELY RELATED TO INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY OR TO REQUIRE TREATMENT SIMILAR TO THAT REQUIRED FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY IN QUOTE. THIS CATEGORY CONTAINS BRAIN INJURIES WHICH ARE EXPECTED BE THE PRIMARY GROUP OF NEWLY ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS BRAIN INJURIES ARE DIVIDED INTO TWO SUBCATEGORIES ACQUIRED BRAIN INJURY AB AYE. INFORMATIK BRAIN INJURY. TB I. OUR SOURCE RESEARCH CONCLUDES THAT AN ESTIMATED THREE HUNDRED NINETY FOUR NEW ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS BETWEEN AGES EIGHTEEN AND UP TO TWENTY TWO WOULD BECOME ELIGIBLE FOR REGIONAL CENTER SERVICES UNDER THIS BUDGET REQUEST. IN THE FIRST YEAR THIS SOURCE RESEARCH WAS PROVIDED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES THE ALEJO AND THIS COMMITTEE. THE DEPARTMENT DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES SUPPLEMENTAL BUDGET REPORT FROM FISCAL YEAR TWENTY SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN THIS THE AVERAGE AND REGIONAL CENTER PROCLAIM EXPENDITURE AT FIFTEEN THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE. ACCORDING TO THE TWENTY ONE INDIVIDUAL REGIONAL CENTERS EXPENDITURE REPORTS FOR THE SAME FISCAL YEAR. THE AVERAGE ANNUAL EXPENDITURE FOR FIFTH CATEGORY CLIENTS IS THIRTEEN THOUSAND OATH FORTY ABOUT SEVENTEEN PERCENT LESS THAN THE AVERAGE FOR ALL CATEGORIES. WELL THIS AVERAGE ANNUAL PER CAPITA EXPENDITURE ROUNDED UP TO THIRTEEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED IN THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS MAY NEWLY ELIGIBLE BY THIS BUDGET REQUEST ROUND AFTER FOUR HUNDRED. THE TOTAL ANNUAL FUNDING INCREASES ESTIMATED AT FIVE POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS. THIS WOULD INCLUDE A FORTY ONE PERCENT UP FROM FEDERAL FUNDS AND FIFTY NINE PERCENT STATE GENERAL FUNDS OF THREE POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS. THIS AMOUNT IS LESS THAN ONE TENTH OF ONE PERCENT OF THE REGIONAL CENTER SPY POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLAR ANNUAL BUDGET. WOULD RECTIFY DECADES LONG IN EQUITY IN THE LA FOR SOME OF OUR STRUGGLING YOUNG DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED CALIFORNIANS. AND HELP ALLEVIATE SOME OF THEIR SUFFERING. SOME OLDER CASES OF TRAUMATIC OR ACQUIRED BRAIN INJURY FROM PRIOR USED WHAT ALSO BECOME ELIGIBLE IN THIS NUMBER IS LESS CLEAR. YET IT WOULD BE A LOGICAL TO ASSUME THAT PRIOR YEARS WOULD HAVE HIGHER NUMBERS. THE MORE LIKELY BE LOWER MOST OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS WILL HAVE ALREADY FOUND AN ALTERNATIVE SOURCE OF SUPPORT. OTHERS AND PARTIALLY WILL NOT OF SURVIVED. ALSO SOME INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE DENIED SERVICES DUE TO THEIR AGE OF ONSET WILL HAVE FALLEN INTO. LEVELS HAD A DISABILITY THAT THEY WOULD HAVE HAD IT BEEN GIVEN TIMELY SUPPORT SERVICES. AND MAY NOW HAVE GREATER STATE EXPENDITURES BEING SPENT ON THEM AND LONG TERM FACILITIES SOMETHING THIS BUDGET REQUEST WOULD PREVENT GOING FORWARD. OUR REGIONAL CENTER SPECIALIZED PROVIDING COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES WHICH ENABLE INDIVIDUALS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL THE CIVIL ADD DISABILITIES. SUCH AS A PARTY DRAMATIC BRAIN INJURY TO CHIEF THEIR FULL POTENTIAL. AND HIGHEST LEVEL SELF SUFFICIENCY. THE EVIDENCE IS CLEAR THAT IF WE GIVE THESE INDIVIDUALS THE MEDICAL. NECESSARY TREATMENT THEY NEED THEIR LIKELIHOOD OF REHABILITATION THAT LISA HIGHER LEVELS OF SELF SUFFICIENCY WILL BE GREATER AND THEY WILL ULTIMATELY BE MUCH LESS OF A FINANCIAL BURDEN TO THE STATE. ALSO IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT TB AYE IN INCIDENCES ARE DECLINING GRADUALLY AND HAVE BEEN FOR YEARS LIKELY DUE TO GREATER AWARENESS AND PREVENTION. CHANGING AGE OF ONSET DEFINITION WILL MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO ACTIVELY SERVE ALL OF THE DEVELOPED DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED CALIFORNIANS NOT JUST SOME OF THEM. WITH PERMISSION THE CHAIR I HAVE TWO WITNESSES OUGHT TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY. AYE WITH ME I HAVE FIVE. CARLENE HOLDEN WITH EASTER SEALS A SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND KATHERINE KITTY GRAHAM A MOTHER OF A SON WITH TBI. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING US TO BE A PART OF THE DISCUSSION AND I INFORMED THE DEBATE. I'D LIKE TO OFFER. EXPERIENCE. RELATED IN A AND A VARIETY OF FASHIONS. ONE OF WATCH IS FROM A PUBLIC POLICY PERSPECTIVE. A AND THE OTHER IS FROM KIND OF THE MANAGEMENT OF THE EASTER SEAL UP BOTH MY MY ONE EXPERIENCE AS WELL AS OUR AFFILIATE HERE IN SACRAMENTO. AND THEN THIRD I'D LIKE TO SHARE PERSONAL EXPERIENCES CONSIDERING I HAVE A GRANDSON AND WE WENT THROUGH THE PROCESS IF YOU HAD AN INVALID. TOP. SO IN A VARIETY OF REASONS I'M VERY INTERESTED THE TOPIC AND I'VE GOT TO BE A PART OF THE DEBATE. FROM THE A PUBLIC POLICY PERSPECTIVE. OFF FOR ME IT'S A PARODY ISSUE. AW WHEN YOU END UP WITH A SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH THAT'S BACKED UP OF THE FACT THAT THE BRAIN DOES CONTINUE TO DEVELOP TELL AT THE STATE'S TWENTY TWO OF NOT TWENTY FIVE OR TWENTY SIX. YOU KNOW IT GOT THE SCIENTIFIC BACKING BUT WE'VE ALSO HAD THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY BEHIND IT. WE'VE HAD THE THE NATIONAL. RULES CHANGED OUR WE'VE HAD THE HEALTH CARE RULES CHANGE EIGHT PST TO GOES UP TO AGE TWENTY TWO. FOSTER CARE GOES UP TO AGE TWENTY TWO SPECIAL EDUCATION EVEN GOES UP TO AGE TWENTY TWO SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PUBLIC FUNDED DOLLARS. IT'S LIKE EVERYONE ELSE IN THE SYSTEMS ARE KIND OF ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THE AGE ARE WHERE YOU ARE STILL DEVELOPING IT'S UP TO AGE TWENTY TWO. OF FROM OF IN A FUNDING PERSPECTIVE OUR REGIONAL CENTER SERVICES A MUCH SMALLER SUBSET OF ALL OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. AND YET WE HAVE A CARD UP WITHIN THE STATE OR WITHIN THE IN THE COUNTRY ON THE. ON THE ISSUE OF OF WHAT CONSEQUENCES TO TO DEVELOPMENT DISABILITY AND MORE THAT AGES SO PROPULSIVE PERSPECTIVE WE ENCOURAGE. IT TO COME TO TWENTY TWO. NOW IF. A FROM A MANAGEMENT PERSPECTIVE. I VISITED OUR EASTER SEAL AFFILIATE AND. SACRAMENTO A NUMBER OF TIMES OF THEY HAVE A TWO TIER BAD BRAIN INJURY PROGRAM I'VE ALWAYS BEEN VERY PROUD OF THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING AND I BELIEVE OUR OTHER WITNESS HERE IS GONNA BE ABLE TO GIVE A PERSONAL EXPERIENCE OF. OF HOW VARIOUS. I TALKED WITH THEIR EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR JUST THIS WEEK BECAUSE I WAS ASKING FOR THE TBI PROGRAM WATER THE NUMBERS GOING TO BE AND ARE WE LOOKING AT KIND OF WHAT WHAT'S THE UPTAKE. IS EVERYBODY WHO'S GOING TO BE ELIGIBLE AUTOMATICALLY GOING TO BE FLOODING THE SYSTEM. AND WHAT THEY WERE SAYING IS THEY THEY DON'T THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE THE CASE AT ALL. AND KEEP IN MIND THAT EVEN WHEN YOU'RE RUNNING A TBI SOONER YOUR NUMBERS ARE VERY LARGE SO I THINK THEY NORMALLY RUN. AB TWENTY FOUR PEOPLE PARTICIPATING IN THE GET PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER CALIFORNIA. ON. REPRESENTING MANAGEMENT STAFF IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AYE AND UP WITH PEOPLE WHO FIND OUR SERVICES BECAUSE THEY'RE SO ALIGNED WITH INDEPENDENT LIVING IN SUPPORT OF LIVING. THAT THEY'LL MAKE THE REQUEST ARE ONLY TO FIND OUT LATER THAT THEY MISSED THE CUT OFF AGE. SO YOU KNOW I LOOK AT THE SERVICES AND SUPPORTS THAT THEY WOULD NEED I WOULD GO THEY WOULD FIT FROM OUR. LONG TERM SERVICE AND SUPPORT PERSPECTIVE BUT THEY MISSED THE CUT OFF AGE SO I THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN VERY HEART WRENCHING. BECAUSE IT JULIA. WEEK EARLIER A YEAR EARLIER THEY CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE HAD A MUCH BETTER FUTURE IN FRONT OF THEM. ON A PERSONAL LEVEL WHICH OF COURSE IS ALWAYS MUCH HARDER TO TALK ABOUT. AND IT WENT THROUGH WE WIN THROUGH TIME AT. PALO ALTO. OH WELL MY GRANDSON WAS GETTING SURGERIES THERE WENT THROUGH SURGERIES FOR ABOUT IT AYE A YEAR MAYBE A YEAR PLUS. ANTI WE STAYED UP ON AND OFF AT THE FAMILY UNIT THAT WAS THERE SO I GOT TO KNOW NOT ONLY HIS CARE BUT ALL OF THE OTHER PEOPLE WHO WERE THERE. FROM ACROSS THE COUNTRY SO IF WE'RE PREPARING NUMBERS AND PROJECTIONS BASED ON HOW MANY PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA GET THE SURGERY JUST REMEMBER THAT SOME OF THOSE HOSPITALS. ARE LITERALLY ACTING AS A TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY FOR ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND YET THEY ARE STILL SMALL. SO WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT NUMBERS I DON'T THINK WE'RE LOOKING AT LARGE NUMBERS IN YOU LOOKING CLEARLY THAT THAT. THE MEDICAL GETS TAKEN CARE OF SO FAR IN ADVANCE OF WHEN THE LONG TERM CARE LONG TERM SERVICES A SUPPORT KICK HIM. SO MY GRANDSON WAS. GETTING. MULTIPLE SURGERIES. THEN HE TRANSFERRED TO. A REHAB FACILITY AND THEN HE TRANSFERRED TO CAST THE COLINA. SO ON THE REVIEW HAVE FACILITY THEY'RE STILL LOOKING AT VERY MUCH MEDICAL. AND ABOUT THE. TRANSITIONAL LIVING CENTER THEY SERVE FORTY TWO PEOPLE AND THEY ARE PRIMARILY FROM CALIFORNIA I THINK PROBABLY SOME FROM OUT OF STATE. AND. THEY'LL HAVE A GRADUATED. LEVELS OF INDEPENDENT FUNCTIONING I GOT TO KNOW THAT PARTICULAR PROGRAM WELL WELL I WATCHED MY GRANDSON AND THE PEOPLE THAT HE WAS GOING TO THE PROGRAM WITH. AND. I DON'T THINK THE UPTAKE IN THERE IT IS. EITHER IT IS ALSO NOT GOING TO BE A HUNDRED PERCENT OF AYE. ION. I THINK THAT AS OUR GRADUATING TO GREATER LEVELS OF INDEPENDENCE. AND GIMMICK THAT WAS COVERED BY MEDICAL SO HE WOULDN'T SEE HE. THE PEOPLE WHO WILL CHOOSE IT WOULD TRANSITION TO A REGIONAL CENTER FUNDED SERVICE WITH A WARM HAND OFF. WHICH IS EXACTLY HOW WE WOULD. ALWAYS WATER SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA TO BE. SO ARE WE THINK THAT. IT MAKES A LOT OF THINGS AYE AYE TOPPED A MODEL THE WAY THEY HAD SET UP THE MODEL WAS VERY SIMILAR TO THE WAY WE WOULD SET UP. A THE STEPS OF GREATER LEVEL OF INDEPENDENCE WITHIN OUR REGIONAL CENTER FUNDED SERVICES. SO FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS. I THINK THAT BECAUSE OF THE PARODY ARGUMENT I ALSO THINK BECAUSE OF THE LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORTS NEEDED. AND THE FACT THAT LITERALLY AS A PROVIDER WE ARE SERVING THE PEOPLE WITH THE EXACT SAME. LEVELS OF NEED. IT JUST HAPPENED A YEAR OR TWO BEFORETHE PRIOR CUT OFF SO I THINK OUR SYSTEM IS SET UP FOR BEING ABLE TO HANDLE IT AND OR CAN MAKE THE ADJUSTMENTS ESPECIALLY UNDER PERSON CENTERED PLANNING. AND I THINK OUR SERVICES WERE VERY ALIGNED ACTUALLY WITH KATHLEEN A MODEL. SO FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS I I WOULD LIKE TO ENCOURAGE YOUR SUPPORT AND I JUST WANT ONE LAST PLEA BEFORE I TURN IT OVER TO OUR PARENTS. PERHAPS IT'S ALWAYS THE PARENTS THE PARENTS WERE THERE AT EVERY STEP BUT PALO ALTO. WE WERE ALL THERE WE. YOU KNOW WE FOUGHT FOR THE HEALTH OF OF ARE CERTAIN SIN DOCTORS AND THEIR SONS AND DAUGHTERS. AND. THE PARENTS ARE ALWAYS GONNA BE THERE SO THE PARENTS ARE ASKING FOR. THE SAME LEVEL OF SUPPORT OF OTHER PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. AND LET ME TURN IT OVER TO HER PARENTS IF YOU. DIDN'T I MY NAME IS KATHERINE I'M FROM UKIAH AND I WAS. REALLY GRATEFUL TO BE ABLE TO COME HERE AND TALK WITH ASSEMBLYMAN WOULD AND I'M WITH THE SUBCOMMITTEE ABOUT. MY SON AND HOW IMPORTANT THIS ISSUE IS FOR FAMILIES AS WELL AS FOR THE YOUNG PEOPLE. OF OUR COMMUNITIES. I WAS SO GRATEFUL TO DR BLOOMBERG WHO IS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF MY LOCAL REGIONAL CENTER WHO ENCOURAGED ME AND KNEW OF SENATOR WILKES. EFFORTS AND ENCOURAGE ME TO INVESTIGATE AND DO WHAT I COULD. SO I'M VERY HAPPY TO BE HERE. MY SON IS NOW THIRTY SEVEN AND WHEN HE WAS TWENTY ONE HE SEPARATE A DRAMATIC BRAIN INJURY. HE WAS IN. A REHAB FACILITY FOR NINE MONTHS AND. IT MADE PHENOMENAL PROGRESS. WENT FROM WHAT THEY SAID WOULD BE A VEGETABLE NEVER WALK NEVER TALK NEVER DO ANYTHING TO BEING RELATIVELY HIGH FUNCTIONING RIGHT NOW. I THINK THAT ATTESTS TO THE PLASTICITY OF THE BRAIN IN THE ABILITY OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE. TO IN FACT MAKE PROGRESS. IT WAS A NEW THEORY AT THE TIME AND I LATCHED ONTO IT YOU CAN BET THAT BLESSED IS THE OF THE BRAIN. BUT ANYWAY HE. AFTER NINE MONTHS HE CAME BACK INTO THE COMMUNITY AND WE WANTED TO CONTINUE THE PROGRESS THAT HE HAD MADE. AND. WE REACHED OUT FOR SERVICES AND THE SERVICES. IN THE BEGINNING OF COURSE TO INTEGRATE THEM INTO THE COMMUNITY AND AND BECOME SELF SUFFICIENT WE LOOK FOR THE DAY CARE PROGRAMS. AND THE DAYCARE PROGRAMS WOULD OF BEEN ABLE TO. HELP HIM SET GOALS HELPING HAVE FRIENDS BECAUSE ALL OF HIS OLD FRIENDS WERE OF COURSE GONE AT THIS POINT BUT. IT TO SET GOALS AND TO. TO DO BEHAVIOR MODIFICATION AND TO LEARN TO SOCIALLY INTERACT APPROPRIATELY AND ALL OF THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF SKILLS WITH TRAINED PEOPLE WHO COULD SUPPORT HIM IN THIS JOURNEY AND WOOD TALK ABOUT IMAGE. AND HELP HIM OF THIS WHOLE STAFF BUT. ALL OF THE DAY PROGRAMS WERE REGIONAL CENTER FUNDED AND WE WERE NOT ALLOWED TO ENTER INTO ANY OF THEM. SO MY SON ENDED UP AT A SENIOR CENTER PLAYING BINGO SO THAT HE HAD SOMETHING TO DO WHILE I HAD TO RETURN TO WORK. SO THEN THE NEXT ONE WAS WORKING JOE WANTED TO WORK HE HAD A HIGH WORK AT THE KEY. WAS. VERY MOTIVATED TO WORK IT WAS. HIS IDENTITY WAS TO WORK AND SO WE WENT TO DEPARTMENT WE HAVE BEEN DEPARTMENT OF THREE HAVE. DID SOME ASSESSMENTS AND YOU KNOW FOUND SOME JOB POSITIONS FOR HIM AND. HE WAS WORKING AS A JANITOR YOU KNOW CLEANING TOILETS FOR SWEEPING FLOORS AT SUCH A WHICH HE WAS HAPPY TO DO WITH THE POINT. BUT. DEPARTMENT WE HAVE ONLY HAS A JOB COACH FOR SIX WEEKS AND SICK JOE WAS JUST NEWLY COMING YEAR IS JUST REALLY NEWLY OUT FOR DRAMATIC BRAIN INJURY AND SO. SIX WEEKS WAS MOSTLY LIKE GETTING HIS ATTENTION IT YOU KNOW AND HE NEEDED SOMEBODY TO COME IN AND SAY AND TO. INTERACT WITH THE BOSS AND SAY WELL YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO ADJUST THIS OR TO HELP JOE UNDERSTAND YOU CAN'T DO THAT OR TO HELP YOU KNOW IMPULSIVITY OR. JOE THOUGHT HE COULD DO IT BETTER THAN THE BOSS COULD DO IT YOU KNOW I MEAN THESE KINDS OF THINGS CAN'T DO AND SO. YOU KNOW TO HELP NEGOTIATE THESE KINDS OF THINGS AND. REGIONAL CENTER YOU KNOW COULD COME IN EVEN ONCE A MONTH TO SAY OKAY HOW'S IT GOING YOU KNOW OF AND THEY HAVE JOB GO TO SIT WILL GO A LIFETIME IF YOU NEED IT BUT JOE WOULDN'T NEEDED IT FOR A LIFETIME JUST NEEDED. TO GET OVER THOSE BECOMES YOU KNOW AND. SO WE. WE LOST THAT OPPORTUNITY AND SO WE DISCOVERED EASTER SEALS IN SACRAMENTO AND SO WE CAME OVER HERE AND A PARTICIPATED IN THE EASTER SEALS PROGRAM WHICH WAS FABULOUS. AND. YOU KNOW WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE COST IT WAS THERE WERE SO MANY OTHER PEOPLE IN THERE WERE SO MANY SERVICES THAT WERE BEING OFFERED AT THE CITY. SAMETIME SPEECH IN PHYSICAL THERAPY AND AND ALL THIS COMMUNITY INTEGRATION AND STUFF AND IT IT WAS A FABULOUS PROGRAM AND SO THEN WE HAD TO THE WORK COMPONENT AND WE FOUND ANOTHER. ALTA REGIONAL CENTER PROGRAM WHO WAS WILLING TO JUST SOAK JOE INTO THEIR PROGRAM AND THEY PUT HIM ON A A WORK CREW WHERE HE WAS A TAKING FROM BOX TO FLORIDA A. DINING ROOM CHAIR IN REBUILDING IT AND PUTTING IT TOGETHER AND HE WAS SO PROUD OF DOING THAT HE WASN'T UP THE INDUSTRY STANDARDS BUT. HE WAS ON A WORK CREW IT DIDN'T COST THEM REALLY ANYTHING TO TAKE ON. ONE MORE PERSON TO WORK WITH THEM AND HE WAS IN HEAVEN. IN BEING ABLE TO WORK BUT THEN THE OTHER COMPONENT OF LIVING IN SACRAMENTO SINCE I'M IN UKIAH IS THE LIVING SITUATION AND I FOUND OF. A RESIDENTIAL CARE THAT WOULD HAVE TAUGHT HIM TO COOK AND TELL HIM TO SHOP AND TAUGHT HIM TO BE INDEPENDENT AND SOCIALLY INTERACT WITH PEOPLE AND STUFF. AND THEY WERE IT WAS A REGIONAL CENTER. THAT RESIDENTIAL AND THEY SAID BUT WE HAVE THIS OTHER EXTRA ROOM THAT WAS LIKE LIKE A CLOSET YOU KNOW BUT WE WERE WILLING TO LIVE IN IT BUT THE REGIONAL CENTER SAID. NO IF YOU PUT SOMEBODY IN THERE THAT IS NOT A REGIONAL CENTER CLIENT WE WILL CANCEL YOUR VENDOR SHIP. SO JOE LOST OUT ON THAT RESIDENTS AND THE GATE PUT HIM INTO ANOTHER RESIDENTIAL CARE THAT. DIDN'T HAVE THE SUPPORT THAT DIDN'T HAVE THE INTEREST THAT DIDN'T HAVE ANY OF GOALS OUR DIRECTION AND JOE ENDED UP. SMOKING TOO MUCH IN GETTING SOME CIGARETTES AND HAVING A SEIZURE AND HAD ANOTHER HEAD INJURY AND SO I HAD TO BRING HIM HOME. SO WE STARTED OVER AGAIN IN UKIAH HE WANTED TO. TO LIVE INDEPENDENTLY I MEAN EVERYTHING WAS TO FOR HIS OWN SELF ESTEEM AND TO BUILD INDEPENDENCE WHAT WE WANTED WAS INDEPENDENCE FOR HIM AND. THE ONLY WAY I COULD REALLY DO IT WAS I BECAME THE CASE MANAGER I MANAGE THE STAFF I MANAGED EVERYTHING AND YOU TELL ME ANY TWENTY ONE TO THIRTY SIX YEAR OLD THAT WANTS THEIR MOTHER AROUND ALL THE TIME. IS NOT HAPPENING YOU KNOW SO IT WAS IT WAS HARD FOR JOE BECAUSE HE WAS RESISTANT AND. AND I IT JUST BECAME A CHALLENGING BANG AND THE LAST ONE IS GETTING A JOB WITH BY MYSELF FOUND SOMEBODY IN SANTA ROSA WHICH IS AN HOUR'S DRIVE TO AND FROM. THAT WAS WILLING I THOUGHT TO GIVE HIM A JOB BUT I JUST GOT AN EMAIL THIS MORNING SAYING. SORRY WE CAN'T DO A JOB COACH BECAUSE HE'S NOT A REGIONAL CENTER CLIENT. SO I NOW HAVE A SON SIXTEEN YEARS OUT WHO WAS HIGHLY MOTIVATED HIGH WORK ETHIC VERY POSITIVE APPROACH WHICH WERE HEAD INJURIES IS NOT ALWAYS THE CASE THAT CAN BE VERY NEGATIVE AN ANGRY. BUT HE WAS POSITIVE HE WOULD MAKE PEOPLE LAUGH JUST WALKING INTO THE ROOM. AND HE'S NOW DISCOURAGED DEPRESSED AT HOME AS WE SPEAK PUBLICLY ON THE COMPUTER PLAYING CANDY CRUSH AND WATCHING MOVIES AND DISCOURAGED AND NOT. ABLE TO BE A PRODUCTIVE MEMBER OF OUR SOCIETY WHICH IS WHAT HE WANTED TO BE HE WANTED TO BE INDEPENDENT AND CERTAINLY. ABLE TO BE PRODUCTIVE WE ENVISION FOR AWHILE HIM BEING ABLE TO GO TO THE HIGH SCHOOL AND TALK TO HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS ABOUT DRINKING AND DRIVING BUT. THAT'S LIKE NOT EVEN VAGUELY ON THE AGENDA AT THIS POINT YOU KNOW BECAUSE HE DOESN'T HAVE THE SKILLS HE DOESN'T HAVE THE ABILITY. AND MY CONTENTION IS THAT IF HE WAS ON SUCH A ROLL FROM THE REHAB IT THAT IN THE COMMUNITY WE COULD HAVE HAD THOSE EARLY INTERVENTIONS THAT REGIONAL CENTER PROVIDES. WHICH REALLY WOULDN'T COST ALL THAT MUCH BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN PHENOMENAL FOR HIM HE COULD BE A PRODUCTIVE MEMBER OF OUR SOCIETY NOW HE COULD BE DOING. CONTRIBUTING POSITIVE THINGS AND IT REQUIRES THAT EARLY INTERVENTION AND THAT EARLY SUPPORT AND IF WE DON'T HAVE THAT THEN WE CAN'T HAVE THE PRODUCTIVE MEMBERS OF OUR SOCIETY AS THEY WOULD LIKE TO BE SO I WOULD. ENCOURAGE YOU TO THINK THAT MAYBE IT'S A LITTLE EXPENSIVE ON THE EARLY INTERVENTION SIDE BUT SO MUCH OF IT COULD BE INCORPORATED TO THINGS THAT ARE ALREADY HAPPENING TO ONE OR TWO MORE PEOPLE DON'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE. AND WHAT IS THE COST AT THE OTHER END BECAUSE NOW JOE IS NOT INDEPENDENT HE NEEDS TWENTY FOUR HOUR SUPERVISION I AM NOT GOING TO BE ALIVE FOR EVER SO I'M GOING TO REQUEST A STATE CONSERVATIVE SHIP TO MANAGE HIM. HE'S GOING TO BE PULLED FROM HIS COMMUNITY THAT IS THE ONLY THING HE HAS LEFT PROBABLY PUT DOWN IN SOME HOME SOMEWHERE IN LA OR WHATEVER HAVE NOTHING GOING ON FOR AND THE COST OF SOCIAL SERVICES THE COST OF. LUCKILY FOR JOE NOT JUDICIAL BUT MANY HEAD INJURIES ENTERED THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM THE STATE CONSERVATORSHIP YOU TELL ME THE COST AT THE OTHER END. PURSES BILL EXPENSE OF INCORPORATING THEM INTO A REGIONAL CENTER WHICH IS ALREADY. FUNCTIONING AND PRODUCING POSITIVE WONDERFUL THINGS. SO THANK YOU FOR CONSIDERING INCORPORATE ó IN THE AGE EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY ONE THEY ARE DEFINITELY YOUNG THE PLASTICITY OF THE BRAIN IT WAS SO OBVIOUS THOUGH. THANK YOU FOR CONSIDERING THE OPTION. AND I JUST WANTED TO SAY JOE'S A LUCKY MAN TO HAVE A MOM LIKE YOU FIND HOME FAN. AND WITH THAT I IF WE COULD MAKE A SPACE FOR THE DEPARTMENT AND THEN I'D ALSO LIKE TO HEAR FROM. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AS WELL AS FULLY. DO YOU THINK OF. TO COME. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR ARM. AS SENATOR WILK NOTED THE PRIMARY CONCERN WE HAVE A COUPLE CONCERNS WITH HIS PROPOSED BUT THE PRIMARY ONE. IS THAT WELL YOU CAN ESTIMATED NUMBER FOR WHAT ANNUAL COSTS MIGHT BE IT'S SUBJECTIVE BECAUSE YOU COULD ESTIMATED A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS. THE CONCERN IS WHAT THE IMPACT WOULD BE FOR OLDER CASES. AS WAS NOTED IN THEIR ESTIMATE THEY REALLY DON'T HAVE ALL THE WAY TO PROJECT WHAT THOSE NUMBERS MIGHT BE. IT'S AN UNKNOWN. THE CONCERN WE HAVE IS THAT. THE SERVICE IS WHETHER SOME THERE'S AN INTERSECTION OF BETWEEN THE TYPES OF SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE IN THE TYPES OF SERVICES. THAT INDIVIDUALS. WITH ACQUIRED DRAMATIC BRAIN INJURY MAY NEED. I'M NOT ALL SERVICES IT WE DON'T PROVIDE ALL THE TYPES SO THIS COULD RESULT IN THE DEPARTMENT HAVING TO DEVELOP NEW. MODELS OF SERVICE TARA FIND NEW PROVIDERS TO PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES AND. WE THINK THAT YOU KNOW THAT THE COST OF DEVELOPING THOSE SERVICES COULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN WHAT'S PROJECTED HERE. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ELLIOTT. AS SONYA PARTICULARLY HEALTH. I AM I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT. THE LA O. HAS BEEN WORKING WITH THE SENATOR'S OFFICE ON REFINING THE ESTIMATE WERE ALSO HAPPY TO. RESPOND TO ANY SPECIFIC REQUESTS FROM THE SUBCOMMITTEE. OF THEIR WE THINK THERE ARE A COUPLE AREAS WHERE THAT WE CAN REFINE THAT ESTIMATE INCLUDING. LOOKING AT THE AVERAGE COST FOR ADULTS ARE CURRENTLY THAT ESTIMATE IS SORT OF BASED ON ALL AGES AND WE THINK THAT MIGHT INCREASE THE ESTIMATE A BIT. HOW WE ALSO NEED TO INCLUDE THE COST OF REGIONAL CENTER OPERATIONS INTO THE PER PERSON COST? AND THEN THERE'S THIS ISSUE OF LOOKING AT. THE OLDER ADULTS WHO MAY NOW BE ELIGIBLE FOR SERVICES BECAUSE THEY HAD AN INJURY IN AGES EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY ONE. WE DO THINK THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN YOU KNOW POTENTIALLY COME UP WITH A A RANGE OF OF ESTIMATES FOR THIS AND WERE. WE PLAN TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE SENATOR'S OFFICE OVERTHE NEXT COUPLE MONTHS. TO COME UP WITH A BETTER ESTIMATE. WE WOULD ALSO JUST NOTE THAT ALL THAT WE DO AGREE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF THAT. CERTAIN SERVICES MAY NEED TO BE EXPANDED OR DEVELOPED. BUT WE WOULD NOT THAT THE DEPARTMENT CURRENTLY. BUT DOES SERVE PEOPLE WHO HAVE SUFFERED FROM TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURIES IF THEY ACQUIRED THE INJURY WHEN THEY WERE SEVENTEEN FOR EXAMPLE. SO IT MAY BE THE CASE THAT EXPERTISE WOULD WOULD NEED TO BE EXPANDED AND SERVICES EXPANDED BUT. IT'S IT'S NOT A TOTALLY UNHEARD OF. ROLL. JAIL AND PART OF FINANCE JUST ECHOING THE FISCAL CONCERNS IN THE DEPARTMENT AND SOME OF. CHALLENGES AND PUTTING A FISCALLY OUT OF THAT WAS MENTIONED BY THE LA WE ALSO JUST LIKE TO NOTE THE. INCREASING ONGOING CAUSES MORE FOLKS BECOME ELIGIBLE FOR THE SERVICES AND ARE IN THE SYSTEM. AND WOULD NOTE THAT IS AN ONGOING CONCERN THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WILL NOT TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE NINE. PATRICK ROLLINS ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION REGIONAL CENTER AGENCIES THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING OUR SENATOR WELL CAN HAS SAW STAFF SINCE THE INCEPTION OF THE BILL FROM LAST YEAR WHICH WAS PROOF BY THE POLICY COMMITTEE BED. FAILED TO GET OFF THE SUSPENSE FILE LAST YEAR SO THEREFORE. OF THE EFFORTS BEEN THE MOVE TO THE BUDGET PROCESS SO YOU'RE SERVING SERVICE A POLICY AND FISCAL SIDE OF THIS ISSUE AND CLEARLY. YOU KNOW ALL OF US IN AM A PARENT AND MY HEART GOES OUT TO YOU I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH. THIS SYSTEM UNFORTUNATELY IS A. FINITE SYSTEM IS A CLOSED SYSTEM IF YOU HAVE A CHILD IN CALIFORNIA FOR INSTANCE WHO HAS TRIPPED SYNDROME YOU'RE NOT QUALIFIED. BASED ON THE DIAGNOSIS OF TOURETTE'S TO BE AND IN OUR SYSTEM. ARE OUR SYSTEMS GROWING WITH THE CURRENT POPULATION OF ACCORDING TO THE DDS AND THE ADMINISTRATION WERE GONNA BE ADDING FIFTEEN THOUSAND. NEW CLIENTS IN THIS COME UP COMING FISCAL YEAR WITH WHAT WE HAVE TODAY. AND OF THOSE FIFTEEN THOUSAND SEVENTY PERCENT ARE GOING TO BE KIDS WITH AUTISM SO THAT'S ONE NEW CHILD WITH AUTISM EVERY FORTY EIGHT MINUTES COMING INTO THE REGIONAL CENTER SYSTEM. YOU'VE HEARD HOURS OF TESTIMONY HERE AND WILL CONTINUE ABOUT THE UNDER FUNDED NATURE OF THIS SYSTEM AND IT REALLY COMES DOWN TO THE DOLLARS. I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYONE THAT WOULD ARGUE THAT FOLKS WITH BRAIN INJURY ARE DESERVING OF SERVICES. OUR SYSTEM OF WAS SET UP. TO SERVE PEOPLE DEVELOPMENT DISABILITIES WE HAVE SOME GREAT SERVICE PROVIDERS LIKE EASTER SEALS AND OTHERS WHO DO PROVIDE. SERVICES THAT THIS POPULATION BUT WE AGREE THAT THERE WOULD BE A NEED TO DEVELOP NEW SERVICES AND OUR IN OUR SYSTEM TO NOT CARE FOR FOLKS. WITHOUT WITH BRAIN INJURY SO OUR POSITION ESSENTIALLY AS WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH SENATOR WELCOME. WE UNDERSTAND THE NEED FOR PROVIDING SERVICES TO PEOPLE IN NEED THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ALL ABOUT. WE'D LIKE TO BRING TO THE COMMITTEE'S ATTENTION THAT BY RAISING THE. ELIGIBILITY AGE FROM EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY TWO IT NOT ONLY IMPACTS FOLKS WITH BRAIN INJURY BUT ALL ANYONE ELSE IN OUR SYSTEM AS WELL SO THE OPIATE OF FISCAL TIED TO THAT. I'M SURE ARE AS THINGS MOVE ON SO I DON'T HAVE ANY. GREAT WORDS OF WISDOM OUR GUIDANCE FOR YOU ON WHAT TO DO ON THIS BUT CLEARLY. THAT IT'S IT THERE'S A LOT OF MONEY INVOLVED WE NEED TO HAVE A DEAL WITH THE FISCAL SIDE OF THIS ONE FUND THESE PROGRAMS. OR UNDERFUNDED ALREADY AND ALSO WE WOULD REALLY THINK THAT. WE CAN'T MOVE FORWARD ON THIS PROPOSAL. FROM THE REGIONAL CENTERS PERSPECTIVE UNLESS THE MEDIAN RATE UP HIS ARM IS REMOVED ARE THESE. ARE TYPES OF SERVICES FOR PEOPLE WITH BRAIN INJURY TEND TO BE EXPENSIVE THERE SOME OF ARM AND REDUCE OUR PEOPLE BRAIN INJURY ALREADY. IN OUR SYSTEM UNDER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN THEY TEND TO BE EXPENSIVE SERVICES. THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR. CARING CARRUTHERS OF THE STATE COUNCIL ON DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES ESTATE COUNCIL EXIST IN FEDERAL AND STATE LAW THERE'S A COUNCIL LIKE OURS IN EVERY STATE AND TERRITORY THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY WE LOOK AT AND FOLLOW BOTH FEDERAL DD ACT AND THE STATE LANCEMENT ACT. RISING TO CONFIRM THAT THIS PROPOSAL WOULD CONFORM STATE DEFINITION OF DEVELOPED A DISABILITY TO THE FEDERAL DEFINITION WHICH IS OUR AGE TWENTY TWO THANK YOU. MICHELLE HIDE. AS A PROVIDER IN APPARENT I WOULD JUST LIKE TO THANK SENATOR WILK FOR HIS ADVOCACY IN THIS. AREA AND ALSO SUPPORT THE EXPANSION OF ELIGIBILITY TO MATCH WITH THE FEDERAL DEFINITION SO THANK YOU BECAME. MEANING CHAIRMEN AND COMMITTING MY NAME'S ASTRA ZENECA I'M THE VICE PRESIDENT OF UNITED DOMESTIC WORKERS HOUSE MEDICAL THIRTY NINE THIRTY. ON I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO SENATOR WILK FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE MOTHER FOR HER TESTIMONY. AS A PARENT MYSELF EXIT WITH A TOAD WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY. THEY GO THROUGH A LOT AND THEY DEPEND ON THE SERVICES AND THANK YOU TO THE TO DTS AND THE REGIONAL CENTERS FOR THE SERVICES THAT ARE PROVIDED TO US. ON WE ARE FAR BEHIND TIMES IF WE DON'T DO THIS. AND I WON'T PUT A PRICE TAG ON MY SON'S LIFE. SO. I WOULD URGE YOUR SUPPORT OUR UNION URGES YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS. AND WE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BRINGING US FOR. EVELYN I WILL HASN'T WITH DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA WE DO THINK THAT PEOPLE WITH ON TV I WOULD BENEFIT FROM THE REGIONAL CENTER SERVICES THEY HAVE A LOT OF THE SAME ISSUES THE PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES TO. AMEND WHILE WE DO SUPPORT THE PROPOSAL WE WOULD. REQUEST THAT THE FISCAL RESOURCES FOLLOW THE PROPOSAL SO THAT CURRENT UP SERVICES ARE NOT IMPACTED. WITH THE ONSLAUGHT OF NEW PEOPLE. MARTY MOTO CALIFORNIA DISPLACING YOU COMMITTEE ACTION NETWORK ALSO A FAMILY MEMBER JUST WANNA SAY. AS A FAMILY MEMBER APPRECIATE IN IN STRONG SUPPORT OF YOUR PROPOSAL SENATOR WILK A. S. FAMILY MY I'VE RUN ACROSS FAMILIES ACROSS THE STATE. IN MY TWENTY YEARS AND STATEWIDE ADVOCACY FAMILIES TO JUST LIKE YOU. OF WHO ARE IN DESPERATE BECAUSE OF JUST BECAUSE OF THE CALENDAR WHERE THEIR SON OR DAUGHTER. ACQUIRED YOUR TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY. TWO THOUSAND THREE WE ORGANIZE MASSIVE RALLIES TO FIGHT. THAT THEN ADMINISTRATION BY GOVERNOR WORK SCHWARZENEGGER TO. OF SUSPEND THE LANHAM ACT AND WE HAD FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE ON THE CAPITOL LAWN. ONE OF THE FAMILY IS DEBATE TO FAMILIES WHO ASKED ME IF THEY COULD SPEAK. AND THERE WERE FAMILIES OF PEOPLE WHO HAD DRAMATIC BRAIN INJURIES WHO DID NOT QUALIFY FOR REGIONAL CENTER SERVICES. WE WERE THERE TO SPEAK FOR JUSTICE JUST LIKE THE PARENTS WERE. FIFTY YEARS AGO. AND THE THING FOR THE. FAMILIES LIKE YOU. AND THE FAMILIES THAT I'VE TALKED TO IN THE PAST AND FAMILIES WHO SPOKE TO THAT AUDIENCE OF FIVE THOUSAND. IS THAT INJUSTICE THAT THEIR CHILDREN. WERE NOT COVERED. AND WERE NOT GIVEN SERVICES AND SO SOMETHING NEEDS TO CHANGE AND TOTALLY UNDERSTAND. THAT THE THE CHALLENGE BEFORE ALL OF US POLICY MAKERS OF THE LIMITED RESOURCES THAT THE STATE HAS. AND I THINK THAT'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE A CHALLENGE FOR US IT NEVER GOES AWAY BUT SOMETIMES DOING THE RIGHT THING AND. I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING MISTER ROUNDLY YOU SAID MISTER WOULD YOU SAID ON THE ISSUE OF UNIVERSAL HEALTH COVERAGE DOING THE RIGHT THING IS SO IMPORTANT. IN THE CHALLENGES HOW DO WE GET THERE AND SO I HOPE THIS SUBCOMMITTEE DOESN'T SAY NO. TO SENATOR WILK PROPOSAL BUT OTHER THAN THAT. IF WE CAN'T FUNDED THROUGH THE REGIONAL CENTERS AND LET'S FIND A WAY. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DID THE RIGHT THING AND HELP PEOPLE WITH TB I AND THE OTHER. BRAIN INJURIES THERE'S GOTTA BE A WAY TO ACTUALLY. GIVE THE JUSTICE TO THESE FAMILIES THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING VERY GETTING CALIFORNIA DISABILITY SERVICES ASSOCIATION ONE I THINK YOU CENTER WILL FOR BRING THIS PROPOSAL.

THANK GOD AND I NEVER THOUGHT I'D SAY THAT THAT THE VA HAD COGNITIVE RETRAINING THERAPY OR I PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE SITTING BEFORE YOU TODAY ON THE SIDES. WE DO NOT HAVE A CIVILIAN. EQUIVALENT.

SEVERAL YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. AS TO MY REQUEST FOR THE DEPARTMENT. AND FOR THE ALEJO. PLEASE WORK WITH THE SENATOR GIVE THEM COUNCIL ON HOW TO FIGURE THIS OUT. BECAUSE QUITE FRANKLY THE THOUGHT THAT. SOMEBODY PLAYING FOOTBALL RIDING A BIKE OR GETTING IN A CAR WRECK. COULD NOT RECOVER THE WAY THAT I'D BEEN BLESSED TO BE ABLE TO RECOVER. IS NOT ACCEPTABLE. SO WE HAVE TO FIGURE THIS OUT WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT THE FUNDING MECHANISM. TO MAKE THIS. WHERE? WE ARE ABLE TO HAVE THIS WORK. BECAUSE PEOPLE DESERVE AT THAT THE FACT THAT SOMEBODY GETS OVER AGE BRACKET. AND WE'RE SCUTTLED FOLLOWING THE CRACKS. IS A JOKE AND I'M NOT OKAY WITH THAT.

WE ACTUALLY KNOW THAT IN SOME PORTIONS OF THE BRAIN THEY'RE STILL DEVELOPING TO AGE TWENTY SIX. AND WE KNOW THAT FROM ADDICTION WE KNOW THAT BECAUSE OF SMOKING. AND AND AND HOW ADDICTIVE THOSE THINGS CAN BECOME AND SO. SO THE FACT THAT WE'RE NOT TAKING THE SINGS IN THE CONSIDERATION HERE. AND WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS IS A LINE ITEM YESTERDAY GOING TO BE A COST TO IT BUT LOOK AT THAT LOOK AT THE OUT YEARS. IF YOU COULD INTERVENE AT THIS AT THESE AGES UP TO TWENTY TWO AND AFFECT THE ABILITY OF SOMEONE TO INTEGRATE BACK INTO SOCIETY TO BE ABLE TO WORK. WHAT IS THAT GOING TO SAVE US IN THE LONG RUN? GETS A LINE ITEM NOW BUT IT COULD BE IT COULD BE SO MUCH MORE COSTLY ON THE OTHER END. AND I JUST IMPLORE YOU TO FIND A WAY TO FIGURE THIS OUT. PLEASE. THIS IS YOU NO I AYE MOFFETT FRUSTRATED IN GENERAL ON ON HEALTHCARE ISSUES THAT WE DON'T THINK STRATEGICALLY ABOUT THINGS WE THINK OF THINGS PEOPLE AS A LINE ITEM AND IT HAPPENS OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND SO. I ASK YOU TO LOOK LOOK LOOK AT THE BIG PICTURE LOOK AT THE POTENTIAL SAVINGS AND LOOK AT THE POTENTIAL QUALITY OF LIFE FOR SOMEBODY OUT THERE AND THE FAMILIES AND I'M AND. AND TRY TO FIND A WAY TO HELP THIS HAPPEN AND MAYBE WE CAN START A TREND AND. AND AND LOOKING AT THESE THINGS MORE STRATEGIC CLAY. AND I I HOPE I HOPE WE CAN MOVE FORWARD THAT WAY THANK YOU THANK YOU SOME. I'M GONNA HAVE TO REQUEST IF I MAY FIRST I'D LIKE TO GET WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S ASSESSMENT OF THE FISCAL. AFFECT OF THIS PROPOSAL WOULD BE. AND SECOND I WOULD LIKE TO ASK IF THE ADMINISTRATION DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND LA JOH. CAN CONSIDER THE CROSS OVER EFFECT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF REHABILITATION SERVICES AND IF THAT MIGHT MITIGATE THE FISCAL OF FACT TO MAKING THIS TICKET. WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD THIS ISSUE BERMAN AND MOVE BACK TO ISSUE SEVEN. A HIP HOP THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT HIS INCLUDED A THREE BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSALS IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. OF THE FIRST REQUEST TWO MILLION DOLLARS ONE POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND IN NINE POSITIONS. IN HEADQUARTERS TO INCREASE OUR CLINICAL STAFF OVERSIGHT INTO AN ONGOING MONITORING OF OUR COMMUNITY A. BETTER RESIDENTIAL HOMES THE ARE PUSHING HOMES THE MEDICAL MODEL HOMES OF THEM BEHAVIORAL HOMES. AT THESE RESOURCES ARE JUST ANOTHER COMPONENT IN THE DEPARTMENT SAFETY NET PROPOSAL. THE SECOND PROPOSAL SHIFTS TWO POINT ONE MILLION. DOLLARS SIX BY ONE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND AND FIFTEEN AND A HALF POSITIONS. UP FROM THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS BUDGET TO HEADQUARTERS THIS IS MORE OF A TECHNICAL CLEAN UP. IT UP IMPROVES TRANSPARENCY IN THE BUDGET BECAUSE THESE POSITIONS PROVIDE SUPPORT STATEWIDE AND WE JUST WANT TO BRING THEM TO HEADQUARTERS. BECAUSE THEY WILL BE PROVIDING ONGOING ACTIVITIES AFTER THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS CLOSE. THE FINAL PROPOSAL. REQUEST TWO HUNDRED NINETY FIVE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY EIGHT THOUSAND GENERAL FUND. INTO POSITIONS TO A BEGIN STARTUP IN PLANNING ACTIVITIES FOR. AN INTERNAL AUDIT UNIT OUR DEPARTMENT DOESN'T HAVE A UNIT AT THIS TIME. TO DO INTERNAL AUDITS WE HAVE TO. WE HAVE AUDITOR'S TO. DO AUDITS OF THE REGIONAL CENTERS AND OF OUR PROVIDERS. AND WE HAVE TO REDIRECT THOSE RESOURCES IN ORDER TO WIN WE HAVE TO. LOOK AT INTERNAL ISSUES OR WHEN WEHAVE TO RESPOND TO AUDITS BY THE BUREAU OF STATE AUDITS THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE THINGS LIKE THAT. SO THAT'S THE ANYA INTENT OF THESE NEW POSITIONS. HELLO DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. WHY NOT TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE SEVEN? THANK MISTER CHAIRMAN FOR THE ARC. JORDAN'S WITH YOUR CAN CP. WHAT WE HAVE NO COMMENT ON WHETHER OR NOT THE FUND SHOULD HAPPEN THAT IS YOUR DECISION WE JUST WANT TO MAKE A PUBLIC COMMENT THAT THE ARE CAN USE P. I AM HAS? GREATLY APPRECIATED THE CURRENT LEADERSHIP OF THE DEPARTMENT AND THE WAY THAT THEY HAVE REACHED OUT TO THE COMMUNITY AND TO THE FAMILIES TO THE PROVIDERS TO WORK WITH US. AND WE JUST WANT TO SAY THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WITH THAT CAN SING NO COMMENTS FROM THE DYESS WE WILL HOLD ISSUE SEVEN OPEN AT THIS TIME AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE A. THANK YOU SO. BY THE SOCIAL WRECKING CAMP SERVICES. I THINK THAT THE AGENDA IS WELL OUTLINES ON IT PRESENTS THE ISSUE THAT WAS. BEFORE. THE. THE SERVICE SYSTEM WHEN THERE WAS FOR. CUT SINCE THE SPENDING CAP SERVICES ANSEL SAREK SERVICES AND IT ALSO ADDRESSES THE ESTIMATE FROM THE DEPARTMENT. THINK YOU WERE ALSO GOING TO HAVE ON ISSUE EIGHT AMY JORDAN AND. AND EVELYN. IN THAT ORDER IF WE MAY. DAVID. GOOD EVENING. IT SEEMS LIKE WE'RE TALKING A LOT ABOUT TWO THOUSAND NINE TONIGHT. AND THIS IS ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO REVISIT SOME OF THOSE PAINFUL CHOICES WE HAD TO MAKE DURING THE RECESSION. AT THAT TIME. THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES WAS FACED WITH MAKING SIGNIFICANT CUT THERE WAS A ROBUST STAKEHOLDER PROCESS ABOUT HOW BEST TO ACHIEVE THOSE CUTS WHILE KEEPING. SERVICES IN PLACE FOR INDIVIDUALS THAT THE REGIONAL CENTERS WERE SUPPORTING. AND A PAINFUL CHOICE WAS MADE THE CUT FAMILY SUPPORT SERVICES. BUT THAT WAS A PROMISE THAT THE SERVICES WOULD BE RESTORED WHEN THE INDIVIDUAL TWICE BUDGET. WAS IT ACTED AND THAT'S OUR PROGRAM THE STATE IS NO LONGER PURSUING SO NOW THERE'S REALLY NO PATH FORWARD. IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT THE MISSION OF REGIONAL CENTERS IS TO HELP PEOPLE TO BECOME PARTS OF THEIR COMMUNITIES. AND IF WE REALLY WANT PEOPLE TO BE INCLUDED. AND IN A MEANINGFUL WAY IN THEIR COMMUNITIES WE HAVE TO PROVIDE THEM WITH THE ABILITY TO DO THAT. SOCIAL RECREATION IN CAMP SERVICES PROVIDE THAT MISSING PIECE WHICH ALLOWS REGIONAL CENTERS TO COMPLETE THEIR HOLISTIC APPROACH TO THIS PROCESS. IT'S ABOUT INCLUSION. WE THROW AROUND THINGS LIKE PERSON CENTERED PLANNING A LOT BUT WE DON'T TAKE THE TIME TO ASK REALLY WHAT IS THAT. THE FEDERAL DON'T GOVERNMENT GIVES US A FANTASTIC DEFINITION AND IT TELLS US THAT WE NEED TO BALANCE. WHAT'S IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE. TO IT AGAINST WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO PEOPLE. WHAT'S IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE OR THOSE THINGS THAT ARE NEEDED FOR HEALTH AND SAFETY. SUPERVISION MEDICAL CARE. WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO PEOPLE ARE THOSE THINGS THAT MAKE LIFE WORTH LIVING. THINGS THAT. MAKE IT SO THAT WE WANT TO GET UP AND WE WANT TO ENJOY YOUR DAY AND WE WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN OUR COMMUNITY. SOCIAL RECKON CAN'T REALLY PROVIDE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO TAKE SKILLS THAT THEY'RE LEARNING. AND TO APPLY THEM IN A WAY THAT MAKES LIFE MEANINGFUL AND SUCCESSFUL FOR THEM. IT BRINGS IMMEASURABLE VALUE TO THEIR LIVES. AND IT AFFORDS THEM THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES THAT PEOPLE WITHOUT DISABILITIES ENJOY. AND REALLY AT THE END OF THE DAY THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ALL HERE FOR. IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT AS THE SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAM IS ROLLED OUT. PEOPLE WHO WERE ENROLLED IN THE SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAM WILL HAVE THE OPTION TO PURCHASE THE SERVICES WORDS PEOPLE IN THE TRADITIONAL SERVICE SYSTEM WILL NOT. SORT OF A SENSE OF EQUITY IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE PROVIDE PEOPLE IN BOTH SYSTEMS THE ABILITY TO ACCESS THESE CRITICAL SUPPORTS. ADDITIONALLY WE KNOW THAT THESE ARE SERVICES THAT INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES FROM DIVERSE COMMUNITIES VALUE. AND WE NEED TO GIVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO ACCESS THEM AGAIN. AND FINALLY. WE KNOW THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS AN EXPECTATION THAT PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. WELL ACCESS THEIR COMMUNITIES AND WILL BE INTEGRATED IN THOSE COMMUNITIES. AND THIS SET OF SERVICES ALLOWS PEOPLE TO DO THAT SO IT ALLOWS US TO MEET FEDERAL EXPECTATIONS. THEY ALLOW US TO MEET THE EXPECTATIONS AND DESIRES OF INDIVIDUALS AND THEIR FAMILIES. AND THEY ALLOW US TO DO THE RIGHT THING FOR NOT THAT MUCH MONEY THANK YOU. THE NOVEL AND I'M HUSON DISOBEY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA JUST ECHO. ON A LOT OF THE COMMENTS THE AMY HAVE AS MADE YOU KNOW SOCIAL RECKON CAMPING MAY PROMOTE COMMUNITY INTEGRATION AND SOCIALIZATION AFTER REGIONAL CENTERS CAN CONSUMERS. WE KNOW THAT THIS PARTICULAR CUT IMPACTED. GROUPS FROM UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES AND IMPACT THE DISPARITY ISSUES THAT WE ARE FACING TODAY ARM AND WE KNOW FROM TALKING TO FAMILIES AND THAT THAT THIS IS A SERVICE THAT THEY WOULD. ASK FOR IF IT WAS AVAILABLE AND FOR THOSE FOR REASONS WE STRONGLY SUPPORT. THE REINSTATEMENT OF THE SERVICES AND HAVE ADVOCATED FOR THAT OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS. I CAN GIVE. I THINK YOU JORDAN ENDS WITH THE ARE CAN YOU SEEKING A QUICKLY ARE THE ONLY COMMENTS I WILL AND IF YOU. TALK WITH INDIVIDUALS WHO WHO DID RECEIVE THE SERVICES IN THE PAST. AND WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT THE SERVICE THAT'S WHEN THEIR EYES LIGHT UP AND THEY SAY OH MY GOSH. THAT. WEEK WHERE I WAS AWAY FROM MY PARENTS AND WAS ACTUALLY LIVING IN PHILLY THAT CHANGED MY LIFE. AND IT SIMILAR TO THAT ITSELF A WRECK ACTIVITIES OUT AT IT IT'S A LIFE CHANGING. AND OFTEN TIMES THOSE INDIVIDUALS AREN'T HIGH UTILIZES OF OTHER SERVICES THESE ARE THE ONES WHICH A LIFE CHANGING FOR THEM. AND WE THINK YOUR EFFORTS LAST YEAR UPON THIS AS WELL SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'RE VERY HOPEFUL THAT THIS WILL CONTINUE FORWARD AND WILL GIVE GOLD WITH HIM THANK YOU. I LEóN DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. ANY PUBLIC COMMENTS ON ISSUE EIGHT. I GUESS. I'M I'M RUNNING A STAMPER SICKENING I'M I'M GENERAL'S PRIMARY CAREGIVER. ONE OF THINGS THAT DANIEL LOVES IN THE SUMMERS CAN'T CRAM. ANY GUESS TO HEALTH FRIENDS AND SOCIALISING AWAY FROM ME. AND I AM AND SERIOUSNESS KID HAVING THE INDEPENDENCE AND WITH ABILITY TO GARDEN PURSUE DIFFERENT A DESIRES IN ENJOY DIFFERENT PURSUITS. AND HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE CAMPS FOR DENTAL HAVE THAT OPTION AND WE LISTED OUT WE GO WHICH CAMP YOU WANNA GO WHICH PROGRAM. AND IN THIS THE SUMMER HOPEFULLY A DINO INTENDS TO BE GONE FOR THE MONTH OF JUNE. I HAS BACK TO BACK THAT'S WE WANT TO DO I WOULD RESPECT THAT. AND IF IF WE CAN MAINTAIN PROGRAM SENTINEL HASN'T AUTONOMY DO THAT JUST EVERYONE ELSE WOULD LIKE TO DO I THINK THAT'S ONLY APPROPRIATE THINK IT'S JUST. THANK YOU SIR. HEARING CARRILLO STATE COUNCIL ON DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES RISING IN SUPPORT OF THIS PROPOSAL. FIT BUDGET COMMITTEE OFTEN HEARS REQUEST FROM THE DD COMMUNITY RELATED TO DIFFERENT RATES PROVIDER RATES MINIMUM WAGE RATES. WE REPRESENT THE THE PERSPECTIVE A FAMILIES AND OF PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES AND WE ASK THEM WHAT'S IMPORTANT OF THEM THIS IS THE ANSWER THAT COMES FORWARD.

PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF ISOLATION LACK OF SOCIAL OPPORTUNITIES LACK OF SOCIAL CHOICE BECAUSE. WE DON'T SUPPORT THOSE OPTIONS ARE FOLKS ANYMORE SO I THINK THE CRITICAL THING THAT WE ADD BACK INTO FAMILIES TO REALLY YOU KNOW IN AND PROVIDE OUR FOLKS THAT OPPORTUNITY TO BE. LIKE ALL THE REST OF US WE ALL WORK WE ALL LIVE SOMEWHERE AND WE ALL HAVE RECREATION ACTIVITIES THAT WE DO. THEY NEED THAT SUPPORT. MARTY MOTOR CALIFORNIA DISABILITY CAMINO ACTION NETWORK ALSO FAMILY MEMBER MY SISTER ACTUALLY WHEN SHE WAS ALIVE VALUED.

SPEAK ENOUGH ABOUT HOW AWESOME CAMP IS AND HOW IT'S A GAME CHANGER. BUT ALSO WHAT THE RECREATIONAL THERAPY SIDE. THERE'S A PLACE OUT WHEN I WAS AT FRESNO STATE THERE'S A PLACE UP IN. CLOVIS. THAT IS CALLED HARD A HORSE THERE PETE RANCH. AND I'VE LITERALLY SEEN CHILDREN THAT HAVE BEEN NON VERBAL GET ON THE BACK OF A HORSE. AND GET OFF THE HORSE TALKING. SO THE RECREATIONAL SIDE. EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AS A COMPLETE GAME CHANGER. OFFERED GETTING PEOPLE OUT AND INTO THE COMMUNITY AND DOING THINGS THAT QUITE FRANKLY MANY OF THEM. PROBABLY NEVER THOUGHT THAT THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO DO. WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE EIGHT OPEN AND MOVE ON TO OUR FINAL ISSUE ISSUE TEN THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE. EUROPE AFTER THE WAR. YEAH. ONE. HELLO. GOOD AFTERNOON I AM JUST GO BROKE STATE DIRECTOR FOR BEST BUDDIES CALIFORNIA A STATE AFFILIATE OF BASS BUDDIES INTERNATIONAL. FOUNDED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE BEST BUDDIES IS A FIVE OH ONE C. THREE NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION WHOSE MISSION IS TO PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR ONCE ONE FRIENDSHIPS. INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT AND LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT FOR PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH THE STATE HELP SPOTS BODIES PROVIDE A UNIQUE MIX OF ESSENTIAL INCLUSION EMPLOYMENT AND LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT SERVICES TO NEARLY SIXTY FOUR HUNDRED CALIFORNIANS. FOR MANY YEARS BASS BODIES HAS BEEN FORTUNATE TO PARTICIPATE IN A PRODUCTIVE WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH THE LEGISLATURE THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES ALL JOINING TOGETHER AND DELIVERING MUCH NEEDED SERVICES FOR THOSE CALIFORNIANS WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. THIS COMMITTEE AND ITS MEMBERS HAVE BEEN DILIGENT AND UNDERSTANDING AND SPEARHEADING THE INCLUSION OF THOSE WITH IDT WITH AND SOCIETY AND FOR THAT WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL TO BE OUR PARTNER. WE CURRENTLY DELIVER OUR SOCIAL INCLUSION SERVICES THROUGH ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN BEST BUDDIES CHAPTERS AT ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS MIDDLE SCHOOLS HIGH SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THIS IS A THIRTY SEVEN PERCENT INCREASE IN THE CHAPTERS OVER THE PREVIOUS ACADEMIC SCHOOL YEAR. THESE PROGRAMS FACILITATE THE SOCIAL INTEGRATION OF INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES ARE STAFF WORK WITH VOLUNTEERS STUDENT AND FACULTY LEADERSHIP TEAMS FROM THESE CHAPTERS TO CREATE AND MANAGE ONE'S ONE FRIENDSHIPS BETWEEN PARTICIPANTS WITH AND WITHOUT DISABILITIES. ADDITIONALLY CHAPTERS ORGANIZE SCHOOL AND COMMUNITY BASED ACTIVITIES FOR THEIR MEMBERS THESE SCHOOL BASED PROGRAMS BREAK DOWN LONGSTANDING SOCIAL AND PHYSICAL BARRIERS THAT INHIBIT INTERACTIONS BETWEEN PEOPLE WITH AND WITHOUT DISABILITIES. AS A RESULT BEST BUDDIES PARTICIPANTS ARE LESS LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF THESE BARRIERS SUCH AS INCREASED VULNERABILITY TO BULLYING. AND DAMAGING SOCIAL ISOLATION THAT CAN IMPACT THEIR ABILITY TO LIVE HAPPY HEALTHY LIVES. ADDITIONALLY PARTICIPATION IN BASS BUDDIES MAKE STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES BOTH COLLEGE AND CAREER READY BY SUPPORTING THE DEVELOPMENT OF ESSENTIAL SOCIAL SKILLS. IN ADDITION TO OUR INCLUSION PROGRAMS BEST BUDDIES ALSO PLACES ADULTS WITH DISABILITIES AND JOBS IN THE COMMUNITY. BEST BUDDIES STAFF MEMBERS PROVIDE INDIVIDUALIZED ASSESSMENT JOB DEVELOPMENT JOB PLACEMENT ON THE JOB TRAINING AND FOLLOW ALONG SUPPORT FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AGED EIGHTEEN AND UP. ALL SERVICES ARE PERSON CENTERED AND BASED ON THE INDIVIDUALS INTERESTS SKILLS AND CAREER GOALS. BEST BUDDIES HAS A PROVEN TRACK RECORD OF HELPING PARTICIPANTS SECURE NONTRADITIONAL SUPPORTED EMPLOYMENT IN SETTINGS LIKE LAW FIRMS FINANCIAL PLANNING FIRMS THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY HOSPITALS LUXURY HOTELS AND HIGH PROFILE GOVERNMENT OFFICES. THE HOURLY WAGE OF A PARTICIPANT PLACED BYPASS BUDDIES IN CALIFORNIA IS THIRTEEN SEVENTY FIVE WHICH IS SIGNIFICANTLY ABOVE THE AVERAGE WAGE FOR PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES WHICH AVERAGES SIX FORTY FOUR TO EIGHT FORTY EIGHT PER HOUR. AND THE FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE OF SEVEN TWENTY FIVE AND CALIFORNIA'S OWN MINIMUM WAGE OF TEN FIFTY. WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST ONE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR FISCAL YEAR TWENTY NINETEEN TO SUPPORT EIGHT THOUSAND PARTICIPANTS AT ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN BEST BUDDIES CHAPTER STATEWIDE. TWENTY NEW CHAPTERS IN LOS ANGELES THE INLAND EMPIRE CENTRAL CALIFORNIA NORTHERN CALIFORNIA ORANGE COUNTY AND OR SAN DIEGO. ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO ADULTS WITH DISABILITIES ALREADY PLACED IN COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT. SPANS EMPLOYMENT SERVICES TO INCLUDE A CLASS OF NINE NEW AND TURNS OUT THE FRESNO PROJECTS SEARCH SITE. TWELVE NEW JOB PLACEMENTS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA TEN NEW JOB PLACEMENTS IN LOS ANGELES FIVE NEW JOB PLACEMENTS IN LONG BEACH AND AND TAKE A CLASS OF EIGHT ME AND TURNS AND THE HARBOUR CITY PROJECTS SEARCH. TWENTY EIGHTEEN TWENTY NINETEEN CLASS THINK YOU. THINK YOU. DEPARTMENT. BERMAN FINANCE VALLEJO. M. SONY PARTICULARLY. NOT WE WE DON'T COME IN ON THE MERITS OF THE PROPOSAL BUT JUST WANTED TO PROVIDE A BIT OF HISTORICAL CONTEXT FOR YOUR REFERENCE WHICH IS THAT BEST BUDDIES WAS PROVIDED A STATE APPROPRIATION FOR IN FROM TWO THOUSAND ONE TO TWO THOUSAND EIGHT ABOUT ONE MILLION GENERAL FUND. ANNUALLY. FROM TWO THOUSAND NINE TO TWENTY FIFTEEN THE FUNDING WAS CUT BAM LIKELY DUE TO THE RECESSION. AND THEN IN TWENTY SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN FUNDING WAS RESTORED AT THE ONE MILLION DOLLAR LEVEL AND THEN LAST YEAR ONE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS. THANK YOU WE WILL NOT TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE TEN. HAVING SUPPORTED BEST BUDDIES OVER THE YEARS AND BEEN A BEST BUDDIES CHAPTER THEIR WORK IS ADMIRABLE. BUT IT'S AVERELL IT'S THE SAME AS THE OTHER SIXTEEN THOUSAND VENDORS TO PROVIDE SERVICE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I PROVIDE EVERYONE IN THE SERVICES THE BEST BUDDIES DOES IN DIFFERENT WAYS. WE DO A COMPETITIVE EMPLOYMENT ON REQUIRED TO CARVE CERTIFIED. ALL THOSE THINGS ARE OUT THERE. THAT THEY'RE THE ONLY VENDOR. IN THE STATE. THE GETS MONEY FROM THE LEGISLATURE IS ACTUALLY SOMEWHAT OFFENSIVE IN MY VIEW. ALL THE REST OF US HAVE TO PLAY THROUGH ALL KINDS OF OTHER RULES. THEY ARE GREAT PROGRAM NO DOUBT ABOUT IT BUT THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF GREAT PROGRAMS THAT DIDN'T MERIT THAT SAME ISSUE. THE OTHER ONE IS WE JUST TALKED ABOUT SOCIAL RIGHT IS PROHIBITED I CAN'T SUPPORT MY ADULTS DO SOCIAL RACK. PART OF THEIR PROGRAM IS ABOUT SOCIAL RACK. HOW IS THAT? FAIR FOR OUR FOLKS AGAIN. HOW COME THE COAL CAN GET THAT SAME BENEFIT THANK YOU? THANK YOU SIR. WITH THAT WILL BRING IT UP TO THE DYESS FRONT COMMENTS WE MAY HAVE SEEN NON WE WILL HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN.
