KNOW WE'RE SPREAD OUT ALL OVER THE STATE TO PUT A HEARING LIKE THIS TOGETHER SO. VERY MUCH APPRECIATE PEOPLE WORKING WITH US AND TRYING TO HELP. HELP US SO WE'RE THROUGH SOME REALLY DIFFICULT- TECHNICAL CHALLENGES SOMETIMES AND ALSO A VERY. IMPORTANT ISSUE BEFORE US RIGHT NOW. SO WELCOME TO THE ASSEMBLY HEALTH COMMITTEE HEARING EXPLORING HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY AND HOW TO CONTROL COSTS IN CALIFORNIA. DUE TO THE CONTINUED STAY AT HOME WATER WE ARE PRACTICING PHYSICAL DISTANCE SEEN HERE IN THE HEARING ROOM AND THROUGHOUT THE CAPITOL BUILDING SO WE'RE ONLY ABLE TO HAVE A LIMITED NUMBER OF PEOPLE WATCH- AND PARTICIPATE AT THE HEARING IN PERSON. ROSS OF REQUIRING THAT MASS BE WORN IN FISCAL DISTANCING BE MAINTAINED BY ALL MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TESTIFYING WEATHER HERE IN THE ROOM OR IN A VIDEO CONFERENCING SITE. IF YOU DON'T HAVE A MASK WE CAN PROVIDE ONE FOR YOU. THANK YOU TO ALL OF OUR SPEAKERS FOR COMPANY IN A REQUEST TO PREVENT PRESENT AT THIS HEARING DURING THIS ERA OF THE PANDEMIC. NOW MORE THAN EVER WITH OVER NINETEEN CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS DESERVE NOT ONLY QUALITY HEALTH CARE BUT HEALTHCARE THAT IS ACCESSIBLE AND AFFORDABLE. HOWEVER MANY CALIFORNIANS ARE STRUGGLING TO MEET THEIR HEALTHCARE NEEDS. EVEN THOUGH MORE THAN 50% OF OUR RESIDENTS RECEIVE THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE THROUGH THEIR EMPLOYERS. NO FAMILY HAS ESCAPED THE FINANCIAL BURDEN AND HARDSHIP ASSOCIATED WITH RISING HEALTHCARE COSTS. YESTERDAY THE SACRAMENTO BEE REPORTED THAT EVEN WITH THE HEALTH CARE COVERAGE EVEN WITH HEALTH CARE COVERAGE OPTIONS. CERTAIN CALPERS PLANS ARE SPEEDING TOWARDS COLLAPSE AS PRICES FOR EXPENSIVE PLANS ARE BECOMING INFLATED. AND BENEFITS AREN'T GOOD ARE GOOD AS OUR PRICES AREN'T AS GOOD AS OUR PRICES SUGGEST. DUE TO THE YEAR- DUE TO YEAR TO YEAR PRICE HIKES IN HEALTH CARE- SURVEY AFTER SURVEY REVEALED THE EXTREMES CALIFORNIANS ARE GOING THROUGH. CUTTING THEIR MEDICATIONS NOT GETTING THEIR PRESCRIPTION FILLED DELAYING PROCEDURES ARE WERE SKIPPING CARE ALTOGETHER. MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS ARE FACING THIS REALITY THIS SHOULD NOT BE. WE HAD A HEARING IN FEBRUARY OF THIS. ON OF THIS CUT YEAR ON COST CONTAINMENT OPTIONS BUT DUE TO THE PANDEMIC WE HAD TO PAUSE MANY OF OUR PRIORITIES. THIS HEARING EXPLORES THE SAME ISSUES BECAUSE HEALTH CARE CAN COST CONTINUE. TO DOMINATE THE DISCUSSION I ALSO WHAT I THINK WHAT WE ALSO WANT THE LEGISLATURE TO UNDERSTAND THE COMPLEXITY OF COST CONTAINMENT. AND MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO KNOW THAT WE ARE LISTENING TO YOU. WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO FIND SOLUTIONS THAT IMPROVE THE HEALTH CARE STATUS OF OUR RESIDENTS. WHILE CONTROLLING COSTS FOR TODAY FOR MEMBERS AND THE PUBLIC IN THE ROOM. WE ASKED- WHEN YOU- WHEN WE REACH THE PUBLIC COMMENT PORTION OF THE AGENDA. AND ASKED THAT MANY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC HERE IN THE ROOM PLEASE APPROACH THE MIKE ONE PERSON AT A TIME. AND PLEASE MAINTAIN SOCIAL DISTANCING AS YOU MOVE AROUND THE ROOM. BUT ASSET PUBLIC NOT TOUCH THE MICROPHONE.

THAT I'VE BEEN TRYING TO BE ENGAGE WITH AND BE PRESENT FOR SO- SORRY I COULDN'T BE THERE IN PERSON. BUT BUT I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING WHAT'S BEING DISCUSSED WHAT'S BEING PRESENTED I'M GONNA HAVE SOME QUESTIONS MYSELF BECAUSE THIS IS A- OF A VERY BIG ISSUE AREA AND AN AREA THAT WE'RE- I'M SURE IS GOING TO BE KEEPING US BUSY FOR THE NEXT YEAR IF NOT AT LEAST THE NEXT TERM- AND I LOOK FORWARD TO. WORKING WITH YOU AS WELL AS ALL OUR COLLEAGUES ON THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEMBER NECESSARY AND WE HAVE ANYONE ELSE WHO'S OUT THERE. THIS POINT OKAY WE MAY HAVE OTHERS WHO POP IN SO. SO AT THIS POINT- AND I THINK- THANK MR MAYES FOR HELPING KEEP ME ON TRACK HERE SO. CLEARLY IDEA NEED ALL THE HELP I CAN GET. I DO WANT TO GO AHEAD WITH OUR FIRST PANEL. MEMBERS PANEL IS- INCLUDE IS DR GLENN MELNICK- A SENIOR FELLOW AT THE USC SCHAEFFER CENTER. THE USC PRICE SCHOOL OF PUBLIC POLICY IS AN EXPERT IN HEALTH ECONOMICS AND FINANCE. AND LARA LUCY FROM THE UC BERKELEY LABOR CENTER SHE'S THE DIRECTOR OF THE HEALTH CARE PROGRAM AND LABOR CENTER WHERE SHE'S WORKED SINCE TWO THOUSAND NINE AND ANALYZING HEALTH CARE POLICY. WHO WILL YOU YOU EACH HAVE ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES AND- AFTER YOU AFTER EACH PANEL WILL OUT ALLOW MEMBERS TO ASK QUESTIONS AND SO. THESE WHENEVER YOU'RE READY DOCTOR MELNICK. HELLO EVERYONE THANK YOU DOCTOR WOULD IT MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR CONVENING THIS REALLY IMPORTANT HEARING AND GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTRIBUTE MUCH OF MY RESEARCH IS FOCUSED ON UNDERSTANDING AND IMPROVING HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. I DON'T SEE THE SLIDES. WE SHOULD BE NOW ON SLIDE THREE. YES ON'T WE'VE GOT HIM ON OUR END SO. I THOUGHT. SO OUR SLIDE SAYS HEALTH SPENDING LANDSCAPE. SO WE DO HAVE A DOWN OF ON A ON A SCREEN HERE BUT- DO NOT HAVE IT ON YOUR COMPUTER. FIVE OF US. IT IS ON I WON HIS GUN THAT'S GREAT. I DON'T KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO. OKAY. DO YOU HAVE THE SLIDE THE SLIDES IN FRONT OF YOU. OR YOU'RE YOU'RE A LINE ON THE SCREEN. KAMALA COVER LYING ON THE SCREEN. AND WE DON'T HAVE A WAY TO GET THE SLIDES. AM I HAVE A HARD COPY IN FRONT OF ME OKAY I JUST NEED SOMEONE TO ADVANCE THEM YES WE WILL YEAH JUST SAY ADVANCE THE SLIDE AND WE'LL DO THAT FOR YOU. THANK YOU BYE NUMBER THREE. HEY. OKAY LET'S SEE. HEALTH SPENDING LANDSCAPE IS AFTER THAT LOOKS LIKE PERFECT YES THANK YOU. OKAY SO- TO MONITORS HEALTH SPENDING WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO BUILD A COMPREHENSIVE DATA AND REPORTING SYSTEM BUT IN THE MEANTIME WE CAN USE EXISTING DATA TO HELP US UNDERSTAND- SPENDING IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE CAN USE BOTH EXISTING DATA FROM NATIONAL SOURCES AS WELL AS CALIFORNIA SPECIFIC DATA MY PRESENTATION PAID TODAY WILL DRAW ON THESE DATA SOURCES LET LISTED ON THE SLIDE. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE NUMBER FOUR. THIS SLIDE SHOWS HEALTHCARE SPENDING DISTRIBUTED ACROSS DIFFERENT SERVICES IN CALIFORNIA. AS YOU CAN SEE MORE THAN 60% GOES TO HOSPITALS AND DOCTORS. AND DRUGS INCLUDING RETAIL MAKES UP ABOUT ONE FIFTH. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. THIS SLIDESHOW SPENDING BY SERVICE SECTOR THE SERVICE SECTOR OVER TIME IN CALIFORNIA AS YOU CAN SEE SPENDING HAS INCREASED IN ALL SECTORS. OVER THIS TIME PERIOD YOU CAN SEE IT'S BEEN LED BY OFFICE BASED IN PATIENT CARE AND DRUG SPENDING IN CALIFORNIA. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. WHAT FACTORS ARE DRIVING THESE TRENDS CITIES AND INCREASED HEALTH CARE SPENDING WE CAN LOOK AT NATIONAL CLAIMS DATA TO GAIN SOME INSIGHT WE WILL CAPTAIN CALIFORNIA WILL HAVE OUR OWN CLAIMS DATA IN THE FUTURE BUT WE CAN LOOK AT NATIONAL CLAIMS DATA TO GIVE US SOME INSIGHT INTO THESE TRENDS. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. THIS LINE RELIES ON A NATIONAL CLAIMS DATABASE ANALYZED BY THE HEALTH CARE COST INSTITUTE. IT SHOWS TOTAL SPENDING PER CAPITA INCREASE BETWEEN. TWENTY FOURTEEN TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN BY EIGHTEEN POINT 4% AND MOST OF THAT INCREASE WAS DUE NOT TO UTILIZATION BUT TO INCREASE PRICES. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. THIS SLIDESHOW SIMILAR DATA BUT REMOVES THE EFFECTIVE GENERAL INFLATION WHICH ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS OUT OF A NINE HUNDRED DOLLAR INCREASE OVER THAT TIME PERIOD IN INCREASED SPENDING. THE DATA SHOW THE PRICE INCREASES ABOVE INFLATION. THAT'S THE ARE IN SECTION OF THE CURVE OR PRICE INCREASES YOU COULD SEE PRICE INCREASES ARE DOMINATING INCREASE SPENDING NOW IN AMERICA. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. THIS LINE NOW PRESENTS CALIFORNIA DATA FROM US BIT ON THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN HOSPITAL SPENDING AND UTILIZATION FOR HOSPITALS TREATING COMMERCIALLY INSURED PATIENTS BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE BLUE LINE TRACKS HOSPITAL UTILIZATION IN CALIFORNIA. AS YOU CAN SEE CALIFORNIANS ARE USING LESS AND LESS HOSPITAL CARE OVER TIME TOTAL HOSPITAL UTILIZATION OR VOLUME DECLINED BY 15% OVER THIS TIME PERIOD DESPITE INCREASED POPULATION YET THE GOLD BARS WHICH REPRESENTS THE AMOUNT OF MONEY COLLECTED BY HOSPITALS FROM COMMERCIALLY INSURED PATIENTS WHEN UP A STAGGERING TWO HUNDRED AND 83% OVER THIS TIME PERIOD. USUALLY AND MARKETS ONE VOLUME DECLINES WE SEE PRICE CUTS IN ORDER FOR ORGANIZATIONS TO MAINTAIN MARKET SHARE. IN TH CASE OF HOSPITAL CARE CALIFORNIA WHAT WE SEE IS PRICES INCREASED NOT ONLY TO OFFSET REDUCE VOLUME BUT WELL ABOVE. TO INCREASE THEIR REVENUE BY ALMOST 3100% THAT INCREASE REPRESENTS PRICE INCREASES. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. WHY ARE PRICES INCREASING SO QUICKLY THERE'S AT LEAST TWO FACTORS THAT ARE DRIVING HOSPITAL PRICE INCREASES IN CALIFORNIA. ONE IS THE INCREASED CONSOLIDATION OF HOSPITALS INTO MULTI HOSPITAL SYSTEMS THAT CAN ACCUMULATE MARKET POWER. AND RAPIDLY RISING HOSPITAL BILL CHARGES FOR OUT OF NETWORK EMERGENCY CARE NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SEE I CAN'T TO THIS SIDE I CAN'T SEE THE GRAPH IS THEIR GRAPH ON THAT SLIDE YES YES. I'M HOPING THAT THERE IS THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES LICENSE IT PROVIDES EVIDENCE THAT COMPETITION CAN WORK THERE WE GO CAN WORK IN HEALTH CARE. WHEN MARKETS ARE COMPETITIVE. THE DATA ON THIS SLIDE TRACK HOSPITAL PRICES PER DAY THE BLUE BARS BETWEEN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE IN TWENTY SIXTEEN FOR COMMERCIALLY SHORT PATIENTS IN CALIFORNIA. IF YOU LOOK TO THE EARLY YEARS WHICH ARE ON THE LOWER LEFT HAND SIDE THE BLUE BARS YOU CAN SEE PRICES WERE LOWER IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE. BUT ALSO THEY WERE LOWER IN THE NINETY SIX NINETY SEVEN AND NINETY EIGHT PRICES WERE ACTUALLY GOING DOWN. IN CALIFORNIA. THIS IS WHEN COMPARED MARKETS WERE COMPETITIVE. THEN WE SEE THIS TREND RE BEGIN TO REVERSE AND PRICES IN HOSPITALS GROW RAPIDLY. AS I MENTIONED THERE'S TWO SETS OF FACTORS THAT ARE DRIVING THIS CALIFORNIA IN EARLY TWO THOUSANDS ADOPTED PRUDENT LAYPERSON RULES. THAT INCREASED UTILIZATION OF HOSPITAL EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS AND MANDATED THAT HEALTH PLANS PAY FOR OUT OF NETWORK EMERGENCY CARE. IN ADDITION MORE AND MORE HOSPITALS WERE JOINING MULTI HOSPITAL SYSTEMS AND MORE OF THOSE SYSTEMS WERE DEMANDING ALL LEARN CONTRACTS. REFLECTING INCREASED MARKET POWER NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. THIS NEXT SLIDE. THE LINE GRAPH SHOWS INCREASES IN BILL CHARGES OVER TIME AND YOU COULD SEE IN THE EARLY PERIOD BILL CHARGES PER DAY WERE GOING UP SLIGHTLY AND THEN THEY STARTED TO ACCELERATE AND EXPLODED. ALL RIGHT THIS REFLECTS HOSPITALS RAISING THEIR BILL CHARGES AS THE DEFAULT PRICE FOR OUT OF NETWORK EMERGENCY CARE. THESE THESE BILL CHARGES BECAUSE THEY WENT UP SO QUICKLY. REYES THE IN NETWORK PRICES WHICH OF THE BLUE BARS AND SO THERE'S A DIRECT CORRELATION BETWEEN THE ABILITY OF HOSPITALS TO RAISE THEIR BILL CHARGES AND TO DEMAND THOSE PRESS AS OUT OF NETWORK PRICES THOSE DROVE IN NETWORK PRICES HIGHER AND ARE MAJOR FACTORS DRIVING INCREASE HOSPITAL PRICES IN CALIFORNIA. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. THIS SLIDESHOWS CALIFORNIA DATA AND PRICE PERMISSION OVER TIME BETWEEN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN FOR HOSPITALS IN THE TWO LARGEST MULTI HOSPITAL SYSTEMS THAT'S THE RED LINE AND ALL OTHER HOSPITALS IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S THE BLUE LINE. THE GREEN LINE AT THE BOTTOM IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE TWO GROUPS OF HOSPITALS IF YOU LOOK TO THE LOWER LEFT HAND CORNER YOU CAN SEE THE PRICES IN THOSE TWO GROUPS OF HOSPITALS WERE ABOUT THE SAME. THEN BEGINNING IN EARLY TWO THOUSAND ONE HOSPITAL STARTED TO DEMAND ALL OUR NON CONTRACTS IT IS REPORTED THAT THESE TWO SYSTEMS- STARTED THAT PRACTICE AROUND THEN. WE SEE THE PRICES START TO GROW FASTER THAN THE REST OF HOSPITALS IN THE MARKET. AND CONTINUE TO GROW AND NOW YOU CAN SEE ON THE LOWER RIGHT HAND SIDE THE GAP. BETWEEN THOSE TWO GROUPS HOSPITALS IS ALMOST SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. BILL CHARGES PER DAY IN CALIFORNIA WITH MORE RECENT OSCAR DATE AND OUR OVER TWENTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS PER DAY. AGAIN HOSPITALS USING. THEIR ABILITY TO DEMAND OUT OF NETWORK PRICES AS WELL AS ALL IN ON CONTRACTING TO GAIN HIGHER PRICES FOR IN NETWORK CARE. INCIDENTLY THE PRICES HERE ARE JUST A FOR CASE MIX. DIFFERENCES A WAGE INDEX AND HOSPITAL OUTPATIENT UTILIZATION AS WELL. AND WE'VE DONE ADDITIONAL ANALYSES. CONTROLLING FOR MANY OTHER FACTORS IS THE STATISTICAL MODEL THESE DIFFERENCES STILL REMAIN BETWEEN HOSPITALS AND THE LARGEST SYSTEMS AND ALL OTHER HOSPITALS REFLECTING MARKET POWER DIFFERENCES. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. THIS SLIDE SHOWS RECENT UNIQUE REAL TIME DATA ON HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS ON EDIE VISITS IN CALIFORNIA AN INPATIENT ADMISSIONS COMPARING POST CODE TO PRE COBIT. SO THIS COMPARES UTILIZATION IT DIDN'T SEEM TO AND TWENTY TWENTY COMPARED TO THE SAME TIME PERIOD IN TWENTY NINETEEN. AND AS YOU CAN SEE VOLUME DROPPED SUBSTANTIALLY IN THE EARLY PERIOD OF COVE IT HAS REBOUNDED BUT IS STILL WELL BELOW PRE COVERT LEVELS INPATIENT UTILIZATION CALIFORNIA'S RUNNING ABOUT 10% BELOW AND EDIE VISITS ARE RUNNING ABOUT TWENTY PERCENT. BELOW SO HOSPITALS HAVE LOST MONEY DURING THIS TIME PERIOD WELL THEY DID GET SOME FUNDING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND WERE ABLE TO CUT SOME OF THEIR EXPENSES THEY UNDOUBTEDLY LOST MONEY DURING THIS TIME PERIOD. ONE CONCERN IS ARE THEY LIKELY TO LOOK FOR PRICE INCREASES WHEN THEIR CONTRACTS EXPIRE TO MAKE UP THESE LOSSES AND WHAT DO THEY HAVE THE MARKET POWER TO MAKE THOSE PRICE INCREASES STICK. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. RIGHT THERE IS SOME POTENTIAL GOOD NEWS FOR CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE CONSUMERS SO THIS SLIDE PRESENTS DATA. FROM RECENT FILINGS WITH THE FROM THE A. M. EIGHT C. FOR HEALTH PLANS FOR THE FULLY INSURED POPULATION PROJECTING THEIR PREMIUM INCREASES FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THESE DATA ARE COLLECTED AND MADE AVAILABLE- BY I SPIT. BUT IT SHOWS FOR THE TWENTY SEVEN PLANTS REPRESENTING ABOUT THREE AND A HALF MILLION INSURED POPULATION. THE AVERAGE INCREASE IN PREMIUMS IS ONLY GONNA BE ONE PERCENT. FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE THIS IS THE LOWEST LEVEL WE'VE SEEN IN A LONG TIME. ALL RIGHT HOWEVER GIVEN WHAT THE DATA WE SAW ON THE PREVIOUS SLIDE WHERE UTILIZATION IS RUNNING BELOW THREE COVERT LEVELS. UP VOTE FOR IN PATIENT CARE AND EDIE VISITS AND ALSO WE SEE SIMILAR DATA FOR DOCTOR VISITS AS WELL. ONE MIGHT ASK WHY THESE PREMIUM INCREASES ARE ACTUALLY NOT NEGATIVE FOR NEXT YEAR. AND BE INTERESTING TO SEE HOW THESE TRENDS FLY OUT IN THE COMING MONTHS AND THE REST OF THIS YEAR. NEXT ABOUT NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO THESE DATA. HIGHLIGHT THE POTENTIAL VALUE OF MORE COMPREHENSIVE DATA SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT WE MOVE QUICKLY. WE SHOULD FORMA CASF WITHOUT FORCE OR WORKING GROUP TO ADVISE POLICY MAKERS HOW WE CAN SUPPLEMENT. THE FANTASTIC GOLDMINE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE WHICH IS THE HEALTH PAYMENTS DATABASE WITH ADDITIONAL DATA. AND WE SHOULD LEVERAGE OUR EXTENSIVE NETWORK OF EXPERTS IN WITHIN CALIFORNIA TO HELP US FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE DEVELOP QUICKLY A COST EFFECTIVE DATA SYSTEM. SECOND LET US MONITOR THESE TRENDS. LATER ON IN TODAY'S SESSION BUT NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. LATER ON A TODAY SESSIONS I'LL PROVIDE SOME LESSONS FROM OTHER STATES THAT HAVE IMPLEMENTED AND DEVELOPED STATE LEVEL COSTS COMMISSIONS TO MONITOR SPENDING AND SET SPENDING TARGETS FOR AFFORDABILITY- THAT CONCLUDES MY PRESENTATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU DOCTOR MELNICK AND WILL HAVE QUESTIONS FOR YOU AFTER AFTER WE HEAR FROM- FROM OF THE SIERRA AND HER SO A LAURA MERCIER SO THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH CAN I DO WE KNOW DOES THE PUMP IS A PUBLIC SEEN. THESE SLIDES ON THEIR SCREEN THEY ARE OKAY OKAY THAT'S AND THAT'S IMPORTANT OKAY VERY VERY GOOD THANK YOU- THANKS FOR BEING A GUINEA PIG OUT THERE TOO DR MONICA NO THIS IS. ALLAH ALLAH CHALLENGE ALL CHALLENGING SO AT THIS POINT WOULD LIKE TO GO ON TO MOVE ON TO I MISS THE SIERRA THANK YOU HI HOW ARE YOU. PLEASE GO AHEAD WHEN YOU'RE READY. GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD INTO THE COMMITTEE FOR HOSTING THIS HEARING ON THIS IMPORTANT TOPIC OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY MY PRESENTATION TODAY WILL FOCUS ON THE- AVAILABLE RESEARCH AND DATA ON THE IMPACTS THAT HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY HAS. ON CALIFORNIA WORKERS CONSUMERS AND EMPLOYERS. NEXT SLIDE. IS THERE A WAY ON OUR END TO RETURN THAT A- WE CAN HEAR A LITTLE BETTER. OKAY GO AHEAD WE'LL SEE HOW THIS GOES. I CAN'T SEE THE FIVE SO I AM NOT SURE FOR ON THE RIGHT WE RUN THE VIRUS ON SITE TO WEAR ON THE CYTISUS CERTAIN HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY CONCERNS HOUSE AT. OKAY GREAT THANK YOU. SO IN LATE TWENTY NINETEEN THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH CARE FOUNDATION SPONSORED A SURVEY THAT FOUND THAT MORE THAN TWO THIRDS OF CALIFORNIA ADULTS REPORTED THAT THEY WERE VERY OR SOMEWHAT WORRIED ABOUT UNEXPECTED MEDICAL BILLS OR AFFORDING THEIR OUT OF POCKET COSTS WHEN ACCESSING HEALTH CARE THIS IS A HIGHER PERCENTAGE. THAN THAT 54% HE SAID THEY WERE VERY OR SOMEWHAT WORRIED ABOUT AFFORDING THEIR RENT OR MORTGAGE. I THINK THIS PUTS INTO PERSPECTIVE HOW DIRE HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY CONCERNS HAVE BECOME FOR CALIFORNIANS. IN ADDITION TO BEING WORRIED ABOUT UNEXPECTED MEDICAL BILLS AN OUT OF POCKET COSTS HALF OF ADULTS THAT THEY WERE WORRIED ABOUT PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS AND MORE THAN FOUR OUT OF TEN WHO HAD HEALTH INSURANCE WE'RE WORRIED ABOUT AFFORDING THEIR MONTHLY PREMIUMS. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. USING THE SAME SURVEY WE SEE THAT HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY CONCERNS ARE EVEN MORE COMMON AMONG HISPANIC BLACK AND ASIAN CALIFORNIA ADULTS THAN AMONG WHITE ADULTS NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. WELL HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY CONCERNS ARE TOO COMMON ACROSS ALL INCOME GROUPS LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS AND HOUSEHOLDS WITH INCOME BELOW TWICE THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL WERE MORE LIKELY TO WORRY ABOUT HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY THAN THEIR COUNTERPARTS WHO EARNED MORE. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. BE THE FORD ABILITY CONCERNS MEAN THAT PEOPLE AREN'T GETTING THE CARE THEY NEED AT THE TIME THEY NEED IT MANY CALIFORNIANS ARE SKIPPING PRESCRIPTIONS ARE CUTTING PILLS IN HALF SKIPPING RECOMMENDED TESTS OR TREATMENTS POSTPONING NEEDED MEDICAL CARE WHETHER THAT PHYSICAL HEALTH CARE MENTAL HEALTH CARE DENTAL CARE. AND OVER HALF OF CALIFORNIA ADULTS EXPERIENCED AT LEAST ONE OF THESE ACCESS TO CARE PROBLEMS DUE TO AFFORDABILITY. IN ADDITION HEALTHCARE AFFORDABILITY CONCERNS HAVE FINANCIAL CONSEQUENCES SUCH AS A PEOPLE CUTTING BACK ON OTHER BASIC NECESSITIES TAKING ON DEBT AND EVEN IN SOME CASES DECLARING BANKRUPTCY. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY IS AN ISSUE THAT AFFECTS NEARLY ALL CALIFORNIANS BUT TODAY MAY PRESENTATION WILL MOSTLY FOCUS ON THE MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIA ADULTS WHO HAVE COVERAGE THE THEIR OWN JOB OR A FAMILY MEMBER'S JOB AND- THE 11% OF CALIFORNIA ADULTS WHO HAVE COVERAGE. THROUGH THE INDIVIDUAL MARKETS. BUT TWO OF GROUPS I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT THAT PARTICULARLY FACE AFFORDABILITY CHALLENGES DUE TO HIGH AND RISING HEALTH CARE COSTS ARE UNINSURED CALIFORNIANS AND THOSE ENROLLED IN MEDICARE. TURNING TO JOB BASED COVERAGE TO FLY THE HEAD PLEASE. IF. IT TOGETHER CALIFORNIA EMPLOYERS AND WORKERS SPENT A HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS ON COVERED HEALTHCARE BENEFITS IN TWENTY NINETEEN THAT'S EQUIVALENT TO APPROXIMATELY 5% OF OUR STATE'S ECONOMY. THIS SPENDING INCLUDED FORTY FOUR BILLION THAT WORKERS PAID IN PREMIUMS AND OTHER COST SHARING- AND I'M GONNA TALK MORE IN A MINUTE ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS WORKERS SPENDING AND HOW IT RELATES TO THE SPENDING BY EMPLOYERS. BUT FIRST I WANT TO ADDRESS THE HUNDRED BILLION- THAT EMPLOYERS SPEND ON PREMIUMS EACH YEAR INCLUDING FIVE BILLION THAT THE STATE SPEND ON HEALTH BENEFITS FOR STATE EMPLOYEES WHO GET THEIR COVERAGE THROUGH CALPERS. CALIFORNIA EMPLOYERS ARE SPENDING THIS HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS. EACH YEAR AND A MARKET THAT'S BROKEN IN A LOT OF WAYS WHICH WE'VE ALREADY STARTED TO HEAR ABOUT THIS HEARING IN WHICH- I THINK WE'LL BE HEARING MORE ABOUT. HEALTHCARE COSTS ARE GROWING RAPIDLY AND WITHOUT A CLEAR AND CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN THE VALUE RECEIVED. HEALTH CARE PURCHASERS OFTEN LACK GOOD INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE BUYING. HEALTH CARE MARKETS IN THE STATE ARE HIGHLY CONSOLIDATED AND OFTEN LACK COMPETITION. NOT ONLY LEADING TO HIGHER PRICES BUT ALSO LARGE VARIATION IN PRICES THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE A CORRESPONDING. VARIATION IN IN QUALITY OR OUTCOMES. A LOT OF LARGE EMPLOYERS INCLUDING CALPERS. HAVE TAKEN STEPS TO TRY TO BEND THE COST CURVE WITH SOME SUCCESS BUT THEIR ABILITY TO CONTROL COSTS IS CONSTRAINED IN OUR CURRENT SYSTEM. EVEN THE LARGEST COMPANIES IN THE STATE HAVE OFTEN HIT ROADBLOCKS AND ATTEMPTING TO TRY TO ENSURE THE HIGHEST VALUE FOR THEIR HEALTH CARE SPENDING. FOR SMALL EMPLOYERS THE CHALLENGES WITH PURCHASING HEALTH BENEFITS ON BEHALF OF THEIR EMPLOYEES ARE EVEN GREATER. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE AVERAGE TOTAL PREMIUM FOR FAMILY HEALTH BENEFITS IN THE STATE EXCEEDED TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR OF KAISER FAMILY FOUNDATION PUT THAT THAT THE COUPLE INTO BUYING A NEW CAR EVERY YEAR. FOR SOMEONE WORKING FORTY HOURS A WEEK ABOUT THE COMPLAINT TO TEN DOLLARS AN HOUR AND HEALTH BENEFITS ALONE WHICH IS AN AMOUNT THAT APPROACHES THE MINIMUM WAGE IN THE STATE. SO HEALTHCARE IS A BIG PART OF WORKERS TOTAL COMPENSATION AND WHEN EMPLOYERS MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT HOW TO ADDRESS RISING HEALTH CARE COSTS. THEY'RE GENERALLY THINKING ABOUT THEIR RESPONSE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE OVERALL COMPENSATION INCLUDING WAGES RETIREMENTS PAID TIME OFF AND OTHER BENEFITS SIX. NEXT SLIDE. PREMIUMS ARE NOT ONLY HIGH BUT GROWING RAPIDLY AVERAGE FAMILY PREMIUMSHAVE GROWN BY ALMOST 50% OVER THE LAST DECADE AFTER ACCOUNTING FOR INFLATION WHILE WAGES FOR THE TYPICAL WORKER HAVE ESSENTIALLY REMAINED FLAT AFTER ACCOUNTING FOR INFLATION. IT'S DIFFICULT TO ISOLATE THE A FACT THAT RISING HEALTH CARE COSTS ALONE HAVE HAD ON LIEGE'S COMPARED TO THE OTHER FACTORS THAT AFFECT WAGES. SO THIS GRAPH IS NOT NECESSARILY SAY THAT WAGE STAGNATION IS SOLELY DUE TO RISING HEALTHCARE COSTS BUT THERE HAS BEEN RESEARCH SHOWING A CONNECTION BETWEEN RISING HEALTH CARE COSTS AND WAGE GROWTH. THAT IS SLOWER THAN THE WAGE GROWTH THAT WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE HAVE OCCURRED WITHOUT RISING HEALTH CARE COSTS. ANALYSTS AHEAD COUPLE FOR TO FLY. THIRTEEN IN THE INTEREST OF TIME. THANK YOU. ONE EXAMPLE OF THIS TYPE OF RESEARCH IS THE NATIONAL STUDY- THAT WAS CO AUTHORED BY ONE OF THE EXPERTS THAT WILL BE TESTIFYING LEADER IN THIS HEARING CHRISTOPHER WHALEY THIS NATIONAL RAM STUDY FOUND THAT HOSPITAL MERGERS OVER THE TWENTY TEN TO TWENTY SIXTEEN PERIOD LED TO A FIVE HUNDRED AND TWENTY ONE DOLLAR INCREASE IN HOSPITAL PRICES AND A SIMILARLY SIZED INCREASE IN HOSPITAL SPENDING AMONG PEOPLE WITH PRIVATE INSURANCE AND A SIMILARLY SIZED REDUCTION IN WAGES. NEXT SLIDE. IN ADDITION TO HAVING AN IMPACT ON WAGES ANOTHER. WAY THAT EMPLOYERS HAVE RESPONDED TO RISING HEALTHCARE COSTS IS BY INCREASING HOW MUCH WORKERS HAVE TO PAY OUT OF POCKET WHEN THEY ACCESS CARE THIS GRAPHIC SHOWS- THAT OVER THE LAST DECADE THE PERCENTAGE OF CALIFORNIANS WHO HAVE A DEDUCTIBLE AS PART OF THEIR JOB BASED COVERAGE HAS INCREASED. THE NATIONAL PERCENTAGE OF 82% WITH THE DEDUCTIBLE- BUT IT'S STILL GROWING. AND IMPORTANTLY THE AMOUNTS OF THE DEDUCTIBLE AMOUNT FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE A DEDUCTIBLE HAS NEARLY DOUBLED OVER THE LAST DECADE. TO FOURTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS. SENATE ADOPTABLE IS JUST ONE MEASURE OF COST SHARING THAT'S RELATIVELY EASY TO TRACK OVER TIME- BUT PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE THE DEDUCTIBLES HAVE ALSO SEEN. AN INCREASE IN THEIR COST SHARING AS WELL. AN ABILITY TO AFFORD OUT OF POCKET COSTS AND HEALTH CARE IS NOT ONLY DRIVEN BY HEALTH CARE PRICES IT'S ALSO TIED IN WITH THE LARGER PROBLEMS OF INCOME AND WEALTH INEQUALITY IN THIS COUNTRY- AS ONE EXAMPLE THE FEDERAL RESERVE ESTIMATED THAT 40% OF AMERICAN ADULTS. DON'T HAVE FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS IN SAVINGS TO USE IN AN EMERGENCY AND THAT THAT REALLY. HELPS PUT THE FOURTEEN HUNDRED DOLLAR DEDUCTIBLE AND CONTEXT. NEXT SLIDE. SO GIVEN THAT THE ACA OF THAT RISK AGAIN I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT BUT OVERTURNING THE ACA WOULD ONLY MAKE MATTERS WORSE FOR THOSE WITH JOB BASED COVERAGE BOTH IN TERMS OF ELIMINATING IMPORTANT PROTECTIONS ON OUT OF POCKET SPENDING THAT BENEFITED PEOPLE WITH JOB BASED COVERAGE AND ALSO IN TERMS OF THE COVERAGE EXPANSIONS UNDER THE ACA MANY CALIFORNIA YOUNG ADULTS ARE ABLE TO BE ON THEIR PARENTS JOB BASED COVERAGE AS A RESULT OF THEIR ACA. AS A RESULT OF THE ACA AND THE MAJOR ACA COVERAGE EXPANSIONS THE MEDICAID EXPANSION AND SUBSIDIZING CHURNED THROUGH COVERED CALIFORNIA ARE REALLY IMPORTANT PROTECTION FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE JOB BASED COVERAGE IN CASE THEY LOSE THAT COVERAGE OR LOSE THEIR JOB. COURTEOUS BY THE HEAD PLEASE. FIVE SEVENTEEN. TURNING TO THE INDIVIDUAL MARKETS- THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT GROUPS IN THAT MARKET- THAT ARE AFFECTED BY COSTS GROWTH DIFFERENTLY. FOR THE MORE THAN ONE POINT THREE MILLION CALIFORNIANS WHO GET THEIR INSURANCE THROUGH COVERED CALIFORNIA WITH A C. A. R. STATE SUBSIDIES. THOSE SUBSIDIES IMPROVE. AN AVERAGE PREMIUM OF FIVE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY TWO DOLLARS A MONTH DOWN TO AN AVERAGE NET PREMIUM OF A HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN DOLLARS AFTER SUBSIDIES. BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT THE ACA AND THE STATE SUBSIDIES ARE STRUCTURED THE THAN ROWLEY'S ARE PROTECTED FROM THEIR PREMIUMS INCREASING IN ACCORDANCE WITH COST GROWTH. BUT THERE ARE ANOTHER NEARLY ONE MILLION CALIFORNIANS PURCHASE COVERAGE THROUGH COVERED CALIFORNIA OR DIRECTLY FROM AN INSURER WITHOUT SUBSIDIES. AND FEES AND ROWLEY'S PREMIUMS ARE DIRECTLY AFFECTED BY UNDERLYING COST GROWTH AND THEIR PREMIUM GROWTH AVERAGED SIX POINT 3% PER YEAR IN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE THOUGH IN THE CURRENT YEAR- AND NEXT YEAR PREMIUM INCREASES ARE LESS THAN SUBSIDIZED ENROLLEES ARE LARGELY PROTECTED FROM COST TRENDS IN TERMS OF THEIR PREMIUMS THEY ARE NOT SHIELDED FROM GROWTH IN OUT OF POCKET COSTS. THIS GRAPH SHOWS ED THAT FOR THE SILVER PLAN IN COVERED CALIFORNIA WHICH IS THE BENCHMARK PLAN THE MAXIMUM OUT OF POCKET LIMIT HAS GROWN BY COVERED CALIFORNIA. AND THE MEDICAL DEDUCTIBLE HAS MORE THAN DOUBLED AND IF GROWTH RATES ARE A REFLECTION OF HEALTHCARE COSTS GROWING MORE RAPIDLY THAN THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL AND THEN COMPARED TO CALIFORNIA INFLATION. THE ACA DID SET STANDARDS FOR THE SHARE OF COSTS THAT AN INSURER PAYS. ACROSS AN AVERAGE POPULATION FOR A GIVEN PLAN LEVEL FOR EXAMPLE INSURANCE PAY SILVER PLANS AND CONSUMERS PAY THE REMAINING THIRTY PERCENT. THROUGH COST SHARING BUT WHEN UNDERLYING MEDICAL COSTS ARE GROWING RAPIDLY THE CONSUMER IS SHARE OF COSTS ALSO GROWS RAPIDLY AN ABSOLUTE DOLLARS. I WANTED TO HEAR THAT MOST CONSUMERS DON'T REACH THEIR DEDUCTIBLE OR THEIR OUT OF POCKET MAXIMUM BUT THESE ARE EXAMPLES TO ILLUSTRATE THE GROWTH AND EXPOSURE TO OUT OF POCKET COSTS OVER TIME. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. AT TWENTY SEVENTEEN SURVEY OF CALIFORNIA INDIVIDUAL MARKET ENROLLEES SHOWED THAT A SUBSTANTIAL FRACTION HAD DIFFICULTY PAYING THEIR PREMIUMS AND OUT OF POCKET COSTS- AND THAT THAT WAS TRUE ACROSS THE INCOME SPECTRUM. THE SURVEY WAS DONE BEFORE THE STATE SUBSIDY PROGRAM THAT BEGAN THIS YEAR. LAKE WITH JOB BASED COVERAGE THESE AND OF THESE AFFORDABILITY CONCERNS IN THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET TRANSLATE TO BARRIERS TO CARE AND FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES. NEXT. FIVE SO TO SUMMARIZE CALIFORNIA ADULTS HAVE EXPRESSED A HIGH DGREE OF WORRY ABOUT HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY AND THOSE WORRIES ARE MORE COMMON AMONG BLACK LATINO AND ASIAN CALIFORNIANS AND LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY CONCERNS CAN HINDER ACCESS TO CARE AND CAUSE FINANCIAL HARDSHIP. CALIFORNIA WORKERS AND EMPLOYERS SPEND A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT ON TOPICS COVERAGE EACH YEAR AND PREMIUMS HAVE BEEN GROWING MORE RAPIDLY THAN WAGES AND INFLATION. THESE TRENDS HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO WAGE STAGNATION AND RAPIDLY INCREASING. AT END HAVE RAPIDLY INCREASED THE EXPOSURE TO OUT OF POCKET COSTS OVER THE LAST DECADE. IN THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET UNSUBSIDIZED ENOLLEES FACE THE FULL WRATH OF HEALTHCARE RISING HEALTH CARE COSTS WELL SUBSIDIZED ENROLLEES ARE LARGELY PROTECTED ON THE PREMIUM SIDE BUT FACE THE FULL IMPACT OF RISING HEALTH CARE COSTS IN TERMS OF THEIR OUT OF POCKET COSTS. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS HEARING AND I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR SEAH AND I'D LIKE AT THIS POINT TO TURN THIS OVER TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OF. EACH EITHER WITNESSES. DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. YES THIS IS MISS AGUIAR-CURRY- THANK YOU FOR PRESENTATION- SO WHEN THE DUST SETTLES- ON TWENTY TWENTY DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THE HEALTH CARE MARKET. IN CALIFORNIA WILL COMPLETELY REVERT BACK TO THE PRE COVERED STRUCTURE. MR A DOCTOR MELNICK MAYBE I CAN ANSWER THAT IS THAT OKAY THE APOLOGIES I WAS. HOBBLING THAT AND FORTH HERE DR MONICA STORY. I KNOW HE IS BECAUSE HE'S GONNA BE TALKING AGAIN LATER YES. SO I THAT IT I MIGHT DEFERRED TO DOCTOR MAY ON THE ONE OKAY DOCTOR MELNICK. MORE THAN. THAT OKAY NO GO AHEAD THERE WE GO PERFECT. SO WHAT YOU HAD REPEAT YOUR QUESTIONS OKAY WE BACK ON. WHEN THE DUST SETTLED ON TWENTY TWENTY PEOPLE THEY WERE HEALTHCARE MARKETING CALIFORNIA WILL COMPLETELY REVERT BACK TO THE PEOPLE THAT STRUCTURE. SO THERE'S A COUPLE OF- PIECES FIT TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION FIRST OF ALL I THE- I THINK THAT THE CODE WOULD AFFECT ON UTILIZATION. IS GOING TO BE WITH US THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY ONE. SO I THINK WE'RE GOING TO SEE IT CONTINUE TO SEE DEPRESSED UTILIZATION. YEAH EVEN THOUGH I TOLD YOU I WE I LOOKED AT THESE TWENTY SEVEN FILINGS FOR- INSURANCE POLICIES FOR NEXT YEAR. ONLY TO THE TWENTY SEVEN BUILT IN ANY ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT KOVIC IT. BUT I BELIEVE THAT THAT WE'RE GONNA THAT UTILIZATION AND SPENDING WILL BE DOWN AGAIN. NEXT YEAR UNLESS WE HAVE SOME KIND OF HUGE SPIKE IN COVERT RELATED UTILIZATION AND EVEN THAT MOST OF THAT WOULD BE COVERED BY MEDICARE. SO I THINK SPENDING WILL BE DOWN- WE AVE SEEN THE L. POTENTIAL SILVER LINING SAID THE FED THAT THAT TELEHEALTH. WHICH HAD BEEN SLOW TO GROW XCELERATED AND THERE COULD BE POTENTIAL LONG TERM STRUCTURAL CHANGE THERE THAT COULD COULD COULD DELIVER VALUE IF WE FIGURED OUT HOW TO DO THAT RIGHT- BUT THEN I ALSO WORRY ABOUT- BECAUSE MARKETS ARE NOT COMPETITIVE ARE WE GONNA SEE PRICE SPIKES. ON THE PROVIDER SIDE WHICH ARE THEN GOING TO FILTER INTO THE TWENTY TWENTY TO PREMIUMS. THANK YOU. MISTER PRESIDENT IS MCCARTY FIRST AND THEN MISTER MAY SOME SORT. THANK YOU- ALL THIS FOR BEING LATE WE HAD A EDUCATION BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE HEARING THIS MORNING. AS WELL- SO I MISSED THAT THE BEGINNING OF MISTER MELNICK'S PRESENTATION BUT- I GUESS KIND OF THE BIG PICTURE TO THIS IS. LOOKED AT THE COST OF HEALTHCARE FOR CALIFORNIANS AND BUSINESSES HAS BEEN INCREASING A LOT OF PEOPLE COMPLAIN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS THERE'S- A BIG DEDUCTIBLES FOR INDIVIDUALS THERE'S DRUG PRICING THERE'S- HOSPITAL OF PRICING THERE IS THE DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN WHAT YOU PAY IN CALIFORNIA FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU'RE GOING TO. THAT HAVE A CHILD IN A HOSPITAL VERSUS NEVADA ARIZONA SO THERE A LOT OF FACTORS BUT I GUESS TO DR- NAMIK OR TO THE REPRESENTED FOR THE LABOR CENTER. YOU KNOW MY LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICT IS ON THE VERGE OF BANKRUPTCY. RUNNING OUT OF MONEY. AND IT'S A SCHOOL DISTRICT AND SOME EDUCATION ABOUT THE ISSUE THAT THEY KEEP TALKING ABOUT OUR HEALTH CARE COSTS. HEALTHCARE COSTS AND PEOPLE CALL MY OFFICE ABOUT TALKED ABOUT THEIR FAMILY BANKRUPTCY OR TROUBLES. A LOT OF IT GOES BACK TO- MAJOR HEALTH CARE EXPENSES SO IT'S SUCH A DRIVER IN SO MANY ASPECTS OF OUR LIFE. AND WE HAVE SEEN THAT THE COST OF HEALTHCARE- HAS BEEN INCREASING. HIGHER THAN- INFLATION AND GROWTH AND IN THE CPI SO I GUESS MY QUESTION IS THIS SUSTAINABLE AND SO YOU KNOW. BUT IF WE CONTINUE AT THIS AT THIS TREND AND DO NOTHING. IS IT SUSTAINABLE FOR THE ECONOMY OF CALIFORNIA FOR YOU KNOW GOVERNMENT CALIFORNIA FOR OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS LIKE RIGHT HERE FOR. FAMILIES FOR SMALL BUSINESSES SO. IF ANYBODY WANTS TO TACKLE THAT PLACE THANK YOU. GO GO AHEAD DOCTOR MELNICK ENSURE DYSLEXIA WILL HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY YES WELL. AND PLEASE TRY TO SPEAK UP AS MUCH AS YOU GO AND WORK WE'RE HAVING A HARD TO GET YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT. THESE TRENDS YOU KNOW IT IN MY OPINION ARE NOT SUSTAINABLE. THE YOU KNOW THE CHALLENGES- THE- THERE WILL BE NO FINITE BREAKING POINT THE PROBLEM IS THE BREAKING POINT WILL HIT DIFFERENT FAMILIES. AT DIFFERENT ECONOMIC LEVELS EARLIER AND LATER. THE WAY OUR SYSTEM IS SET UP- AND SO BUT THESE THE SPENDING IS HAVING MANY AND NEGATIVE- ECONOMIC AND HEALTH EFFECTS RIGHT FAMILY TAKE HOME PAY IS BEING DEPRESSED. OUT OF POCKET. SPENDING IS INCREASING WHICH IS REDUCING FAMILY BUDGET SO THERE'S ALL KINDS OF NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES- THAT JUST ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO ACCELERATE ACCUMULATE. AND I AGREE WITH YOU I DON'T THINK IT IS SUSTAINABLE. THIS LUCY A DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT ON THAT. IN A POT OF PLEASE GO AHEAD APOLOGIES I COULDN'T HEAR PROFESSOR MELNICK THE ANSWER IF I MAY REPEAT SOME OF WHAT HE SAID- BUT I DEFINITELY THINK THAT THIS COST GROWTH IS UNSUSTAINABLE- FOR FINANCIAL REASONS THAN FOR HEALTH REASONS M. FINANCIALLY M. HEALTHCARE COST GROWTH IS HAVING SUCH A BIG IMPACT ON WORKERS WAGES IT SAYS A STRUGGLE FOR EMPLOYERS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY'RE GONNA DO EVERY YEAR IN RESPONSE TO RISING HEALTHCARE COSTS- AND ED THE PROBLEM IS ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE OVER TIME AS AND IN-TERMS OF THE HEALTH IMPACTS WE ALREADY SEE SO MANY CALIFORNIANS. NOT GETTING THE HEALTH CARE THAT WE NEED AND- IT THE HEALTH IMPACTS OF AVOIDING CARE DUE TO COST ARE JUST GOING TO GET WORSE AND WORSE OVER TIME. THANK YOU. MISTER MASON. I THINK STARTER WOULDN'T I'M NOT SURE AND I KNOW THAT OF THEM LOOKING AT THE AGENDA YOU KNOW WE'RE GONNA BE TALKING ABOUT HEALTH CARE COST DRIVERS- WE'RE GONNA GET DOWN TO HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION AND RIGHT TOWARDS THE- LOOKS LIKE OPTIONS TO CONTROLLING COSTS. BUT THE I'VE BEEN ON THIS COMMITTEE NOW FOR. SEVERAL YEARS- AND- IT SEEMS AS THOUGH WE CONTINUE TO KEEP. ASKING THESE QUESTIONS SO WE CAN CONTINUE TO KEEP TALKING ABOUT CONTROLLING COSTS BECAUSE COSTS KEEP GOING UP. AND EVEN THOUGH I'VE BEEN ON THIS COMMITTEE FOR A COUPLE YEARS THIS IS NOTHING NEW. TO THIS COMMITTEE IN ARE NOTHING NEW TO THIS LEGISLATURE- THE SEVEN RICCARDI WAS TALKING ABOUT THE SCHOOLS OPENING UP BUT I KNOW SOME OF THE MCCARTY SERVED ON. OF THE SACRAMENTO CITY COUNCILS I SERVED ON. MY SMALL TOWN- CITY COUNCIL BACK IN STARTING IN TWO THOUSAND TWO YOU KNOW WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT TWO THOUSAND TWO. AND TWO THOUSAND THREE. AND TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR AND TWO THOUSAND FIVE. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RISING COST OF HEALTHCARE AND HOW THAT WAS TAKING A LARGER LARGER CHUNK. OF OUR BUDGETS THIS IS NOTHING NEW OR NOW TWENTY YEARS. AS THE TIME THAT I'VE- AT IN MY PUBLIC SERVICE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS. AND EVERYBODY KEEPS TALKING ABOUT COSTS GOING UP BUT WE NEVER GET DOWN TO WHAT THE SOLUTION. IS AND SO. I'M GONNA KEEP ASKING THIS QUESTION OF THESE EXPERTS BECAUSE WE KEEP WE KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEM IS RIGHT WE CAN START TO POINT THINGS OUT OF THE BIG PHARMA OR ITS CONSOLIDATIONS OR WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE. HOW DO WE SOLVE THIS PROBLEM A FEW YEARS AGO WHEN THE ACA CAME UP THAT SEEM TO BE OF THE OVERALL ANSWERED YET WE NOW KNOW EVEN FOR THE ACA. I'M ISN'T AS IN A FACT THAT COSTS ARE STILL GOING UP AND SO WOULD LIKE TO ASK THE QUESTION OF BOTH OF YOU. IS WHAT'S THE ANSWER TO THIS WE KNOW THAT THIS ISN'T A FREE I'M A FREE MARKET KIND OF A GUY. BUT THERE'S BEEN MARKET FAILURE WITH OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM TO FACT. SO HOW DO WE HOW DO WE SOLVE THAT MARKET FAILURE TO BE ABLE TO ULTIMATELY GET REAL COST REDUCTIONS WITH OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM HOW DO WE MAXIMIZE VALUE. OF FOR THE PEOPLE THAT WE SERVE BECAUSE I DON'T WANNA BE HERE TWENTY YEARS AROUND TWENTY YEARS FROM NOW AND STILL TALKING ABOUT. THIS VERY SAME THING. ACTUALLY YOU PROBABLY WON'T BE BECAUSE OF TERM LIMITS BUT I DIDN'T I DIDN'T EVEN LIKE AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER BUT I'M- TALKING ABOUT. IN CALIFORNIA- AND IN SOME IN SOME CAPACITY. YEAH SORRY WE HAVE TO HAVE A LITTLE FUN HERE. PLEASE EITHER BOTH OF YOU WOULD LOVE TO HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS. PLEASE UP MS WITH VIA. YES. GO AHEAD. WELL I THINK WE THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE HEARING ABOUT SOME OF THE SOLUTIONS LATER IN THIS HEARING AND FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN FROM THE AGENDA IT LOOKS LIKE THAT YOU KNOW THE RIGHT KIND OF SOLUTIONS ARE ON THE- ON THE AGENDA A WE DEFINITELY NEED BETTER DATA ABOUT THEM BUT M. HOWEVER MANY OF CURRENTLY BEING SPENT AND END UP THE FOUNDATION FOR IMPROVING UPON THE SYSTEM IT'S CERTAINLY NOT SUFFICIENT- AT IT WE NEED TO EARNED. IT MORE ACCOUNTABILITY WITHIN THE SYSTEM AND ONCE WE HAVE THAT DATA FOR REDUCING THE COST GROWTH- THE PROPOSAL THAT WAS MADE LAST YEAR AND THE LEGISLATURE BY A FAMILY MEMBER WOULD AND BY THE GOVERNOR IN TERMS OF THE OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY I THINK WOULD MOVE US SENATE A GREAT DIRECTION IN TERMS OF- CAPPING HOW MUCH ARE COST GROWTH IN OUR COSTS ARE GROWING EACH YEAR- AND PUTTING SOME ACCOUNTABILITY IN THE SYSTEM FOR THAT WE ALSO. NEED TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF EMERGENCY. OUT OF NETWORK. PRICE OF THE- AT PROFESSOR MILLER TALKED OF. AND THERE HAVE BEEN SOLUTIONS PROPOSED AT THE STATE LEVEL AND THE FEDERAL LEVEL TO ADDRESS THAT CONCERN- AND THOSE ARE JUST A FEW OF THE- EXAMPLES. OF SOLUTIONS THAT I THINK ARE VERY POSSIBLE AT THE STATE LEVEL. THANK YOU DOCTOR MELNICK. MAGIC BULLETS HERE GUESSES BUT STILL HOLDING OUT HOPE THAT WE CAN HAVE A COMPETITIVE SYSTEM BUT I AGREE WITH. THAT YEAH THERE'S MARKET FAILURE THROUGHOUT OUR SYSTEM RIGHT NOW AND SO I'M NOT A BIG FAN OF REGULATION BUT REGULATION IS NEEDED TO RESTORE COMPETITION TO OUR MARKET. AND UP STILL HAVE HOPE THAT IF WE UNDERTAKE THE RIGHT PUBLIC POLICIES AND GET US BACK TO A COMPETITIVE MARKET THAT CAN BE PART OF THE SOLUTION HERE AND SO WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS DATA AND TRANSPARENCY WHICH IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT TO COMPETITIVE MARKETS SO WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THE INVESTMENT. TO GET THE DATA OUT THERE SO WE COME MORE TRANSPARENT SO ALL OF US UNDERSTAND WHAT THE TRADE OFFS ARE ALL RIGHT THEN YEAH IT IN MY MIND THAT YOU KNOW THERE'S A COUPLE OF SPECIFIC THINGS UP I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT THEM LATER. BUT YEAH WE REALLY SHOULD FOLLOW THE ATTORNEY GENERAL JUST SETTLED A BIG ANTI TRUST CASE IN THE HOSPITAL MARKET IN CALIFORNIA WE SHOULD LOOK AT THAT SETTLEMENT BECAUSE THAT CASE PRODUCED EVIDENCE THAT SHOWS. THE POWER OF MARKET POWER BY BIG SYSTEMS AND THAT'S SETTLEMENT INCLUDES TERMS THAT WOULD RESTORE COMPETITION TO THE BIGGEST DRIVER OF HEALTHCARE SPENDING WHICH IS HOSPITAL SPENDING IN CALIFORNIA SO THERE ARE THINGS WE DO KNOW ENOUGH NOW THAT WE CAN MOVE QUICKLY. AND THEN GET MORE DATA AND FIGURE OUT OTHER AREAS TO RESTORE COMPETITION. SO THAT'S DRIVING EFFICIENCY. QUALITY AND VALUE GOING FORWARD. THANK YOU THANK YOU DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR. ONLY THING I HAVE TO ASK ABOUT TRANSPARENCY IN DATA BUT WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THAT LATER. OKAY MISTER NAZARIAN. ARE YOU OUT THERE IF YOU HAD TO HAVE A QUESTION. I'M GOOD THANK YOU ABOUT YOU MISS WALDRON CAN YOU CAN YOU I KNOW YOU'RE HAVING DIFFICULTY HEARING US. YES I HAVE A- A COUPLE QUICK QUESTIONS. BOB PERMISSIBLE THEA I GUESS I COULD START. REGARDING THE DAY OUT OF POCKET COSTS WHICH ARE YOU KNOW. WHAT ROSE UP AS A BIG CONCERN- IN THE COST ISSUES THAT PEOPLE WORRIED ABOUT- WHEN YOU LOOK AT OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IN GENERAL THE WAY IT'S SET UP- YOU KNOW IT'S BASICALLY OF QUALCOMM'S THERE ARE THOUSANDS HOW CAN YOU NAVIGATE. THE COMPLEX SYSTEM WHEN WE LOOK AT YOU KNOW WHAT. WHAT ARE CO PAYS ARE. WE'VE THAT ONE WHERE THERE MAY BE WERE IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM THEN ABOUT A MONTH OR SO AGO FIVE WILL GET AN ESTIMATE FROM THE INSURANCE COMPANY THAT YOU KNOW. IS SO HIGH THAT YOU'RE SCARED TO DEATH THINKING HOW CAN I HAVE A PAY THAT THEN ALL THE SUDDEN ANOTHER MONTH OR TWO GOES BY HERE IS THE NOTHING. AND THEN YOU GET A BILL AND IT. HARDLY ANYTHING OR IT COULD BE QUITE A LOT SO I CAN DEFINITELY SEE HOW PEOPLE CAN BE WORRIED ABOUT THOSE OUT OF POCKET COSTS SPECIALLY WHEN THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE- WHEN YOU GO IN AND BE NICE IF YOU KIND OF KNEW WHAT YOU'RE PAYING FOR WHEN YOU GO AND WHAT THAT WOULD COST. BUT IT'S SUCH A CALM. THIS YOU KNOW IF ENGLISH OF THE FACT LET. CO YOU KNOW HOW CAN YOU EVER TRY TO NAVIGATE THE NIGHT I KNOW. ANOTHER ISSUE IS YOU KNOW YOU LOOK AT DENTAL INSURANCE. AND I KNOW I DO IT MYSELF IF- IT RUNS OUT BUT THAT THAT DOESN'T PAY FOR ALL THAT MUCH ANYWAY YOU JUST CARRIED OVER AND CONTINUE THE TREATMENT NEXT YEAR AND THE NEXT CALENDAR YEAR RATHER THAN FINISHED IT YOU KNOW WHEN IT NEEDS TO BE SO. I MEAN THAT THOSE ARE ISSUES THAT I SAW WHEN I WAS I WAS GOING THROUGH THE SLIDE AHEAD OF TIME. THAT CAME TO LIGHT TO ME AS THE WAY PEOPLE IN GENERAL BEHAVE- DUE TO WHAT THEY'RE PRESENTED WITH IN OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND- I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE SOLUTION S TO THAT. AND THE MORNING IF THAT'S WHAT YOU THOUGHT HE WAS YOUR DATA CAME UP. MR SEAH. ED THE QUESTION HERE. YOU COULDN'T EGGMAN IN THE REMAIN WOMEN'S ACKERMAN I COULD REPEAT IT I COULDN'T HEAR ANY OF IT. I WELL I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT YOU CAN HEAR THAT. MAYBE WE CAN EMAIL THE QUESTION TO YOU AND- WE'LL GET AN OUTLET THAT WAY I APOLOGIZE MISS WALDRON IT SEEMS TO BE THAT THERE WE WE'VE GOT. A TECHNICAL CHALLENGE IN GETTING AND I WILL DO A BETTER JOB IN THE FUTURE I WILL BE TRY TO WRITE DOWN THE QUESTION AS OUR OUR MEMBERS ARE TRYING TO ASK QUESTIONS REMOTELY SO ALL RIGHT THEM DOWN SO AGAIN I APOLOGIZE MISS WALDRON I THINK THAT SOME OF WHAT YOU'RE ASK IT WAS MISS WALDRON IS ASKING WILL BE. PROBABLY ADDRESSED AS WE GO FORWARD IN THE PROGRAM HERE- I THINK WE'RE GENERAL GENERAL QUESTION IN GENERAL CONCERNS ABOUT YOU KNOW AS THE COST CONTINUE YOU KNOW CAN CONTINUE TO RISE IN THE OVERALL EFFECT ON PEOPLE WHICH- IS I AM I AM I FEEL PRETTY CONFIDENT THAT THAT THAT WILL COME UP HOWEVER IF. MISS WALDRON DOESN'T GET THAT QUESTION ANSWERED IT WILL HAVE FOR WHAT WILL GET YOU IN WRITING WE'LL GET WE'LL SEE WE GET A DIRECT ANSWER THAT WAY SO ANYWAY BUT IT DANCE AROUND THAT ONE A LITTLE BIT SO- THANK YOU I WANT TO AND FIRST BUT THAT WAS A THANK YOU TO BOTH BOTH PANELISTS I THINK THIS IS REALLY INFORMATION GOOD INFORMATION TO HELP TO SET THE STAGE FOR THINGS AND I WANT TO GO TO DOCTOR MELNICK. AS OF A COUPLE KIND OF SPECIFIC QUESTIONS AND THEN IT WILL MOVE ON IN THE INTEREST OF TIME SO. TO QUESTIONS HERE FIRST OF ALL. YOUR SLIDE ON. PAGE NINE IT'S SAYS IT SAYS CALIFORNIA DATA SHOW SIMILAR TRENDS. PRICES INCREASING OR DRIVING INCREASED HOSPITAL SPENDING SO WHAT YOU SAID WITH YOUR SLIDE SAYS. THAT BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT AND TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN WE HAD A FIFTEEN PERCENT. DROP IN. VOLUME AND A TWO HUNDRED AND 83% INCREASE IN SPENDING SO. YOU KNOW YOU'RE THE ECONOMIST HERE. IS THAT THOSE INCREASES TRYING TO MAKE UP FOR THE FOR THE LOST REVENUE IN IN THE VOLUME AND FOR WHAT IS THERE ANOTHER DELTA THERE AS WELL BECAUSE IF YOU'RE VOLUMES GOING DOWN. YEAH AND YOU'RE NOT AND YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO INCREASE EFFICIENCIES THE ONLY WAY YOU'RE GOING TO RESTORE THAT REVENUE IS TO INCREASE PRICES SO. SO DOES THOSE INCREASE PRICES LEAD TO. INDEED ADDITIONAL PROFITS OR ARE THEY TRYING TO MAKE UP FOR THE DECREASE IN VOLUME. WELL IT'S A CUT IT'S A GOOD QUESTION IS A COMBINATION OF FACTORS SO- YOU KNOW IT PART OF THAT INCREASE GENERAL INFLATION. BUT INFLATION WAS RELATIVELY LOW DURING THAT TIME PERIOD I CAN'T REMEMBER THE NUMBERS BUT MAYBE- YOU YOU'RE A BABY 30% OF THAT TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY PERCENT. IS UNDERLYING CPI YEAH THEN ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAPPENED IS- HOSPITALS HAVE ALSO BECOME QUIETLY OVER TIME GIANT EMERGENCY CENTERS. SO IN CALIFORNIA TWO THIRDS OF THE PATIENTS ADMITTED TO A HOSPITAL COME THROUGH THE EMERGENCY ROOM. AND SO THEY TEND TO BE SICKER. AND MORE OF THE LESS SEVERELY ILL PATIENTS ARE BEING TREATED NOW AS OUTPATIENTS SO PART OF THAT INCREASE IS CHANGING PATIENT MIX SEVERITY OF ILLNESS CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY AND THINGS LIKE THAT. SO THAT INCREASE BUT A BIG CHUNK OF IT IS AND ONE ONE COMMERCE TALK ABOUT A FEW OUR PRICE INCREASE WHAT THEY MEAN IS. IT'S NOT DRIVEN BY CHANGES IN THE PRODUCT BUT RATHER IN THIS CASE WERE TRIPPING IT TO. MARKET POWER THE ABILITY TO RAISE PRICES NOT BECAUSE THE PRODUCT IS BETTER OR SERVICES BETTER WHATEVER SIMPLY BECAUSE WE CAN WE HAVE THE POWER TO RAISE PRICES- TO USE THAT MONEY TO DO OTHER THINGS. IN SOME CASES HOSPITAL PROFITS YOU KNOW INCREASED DRAMATICALLY. YOU KNOW FOR THE CENTER CASE THERE WERE THERE'S DATA IN THE RECORD THAT SHOWED. UP FOR TEN YEAR PERIOD- SUTTER WAS AVERAGING FORTY PLUS PERCENT PROFIT MARGIN ON COMMERCIAL PATIENTS EVERY YEAR FOR TEN YEARS. BECAUSE OF THEIR MARKET POWER SO IN THAT CASE THEY WERE GENERATING PROFITS FROM THOSE INCREASE PRICES. OF STOP THEIR IN A KIND OF A FOLLOW UP TO THAT SO IT WHAT ARE YOUR SLIDES AND I'M JUST LOOKING FOR A KIND OF A GENERAL ANSWER HERE AS HE TALKED ABOUT OUT OF NETWORK. CAUGHT UP COSTS IN EMERGENCY ROOMS WHAT POINT DID YOU START WE START TO SEE THAT BEGIN TO SPIKE. BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE DID WE HAVE WE HAVE A SURPRISE BILLING. WE HAVE SURPRISE BILLING BILL IN CALIFORNIA AB SEVENTY TWO WAS PASSED IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN. AND IT DOESN'T COVER EMERGENCY ROOMS AND ENOUGH YOU'RE IN AN EMERGENCY SOMETIMES IF YOU'RE BROUGHT TO A HOSPITAL YOU DON'T HAVE A CHOICE WHERE YOU'RE GOING. SO YOU MAY BE OUT OF NETWORK. AND YOU KNOW WE HAVE TRIED AND THE LET'S INTEREST TRIED TO MOVE. YOU KNOW THE SURPRISE BILLING INTO THE E. R. AND HAS NOT BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN THAT SO I'M CURIOUS. WHERE WHAT TIME FRAME DID WE START TO SEE THAT SPIKE. AND BECAUSE IT IT FEELS LIKE IT'S IT HAS IT IS A SPIKE AND IT'S HAPPENED FAIRLY RECENTLY. IT EVOLVED OVER TIME AND SO WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE OF THE LEGISLATION IN CALIFORNIA WHICH WAS A GOOD LAW BASICALLY SAID YOU KNOW FOR PUBLIC HEALTH PURPOSES IF YOU HAVE AN EMERGENCY USUALLY GO TO THE NEAREST EMERGENCY ROOM AND YOUR PLAN HAVE TO PAY. BUT THE HOSPITAL'S FIGURED OUT A WE RAISE OUR BILL CHARGE WE DON'T HAVE A CONTRACT WE'RE GOING TO NOW SUBMIT THAT AS THE PRICE. AND SO THAT HAS CONTINUALLY GROWN AND GROWN AND GROWN OVER TIME AT THE SAME TIME AS I MENTIONED. HOSPITALS HAVE BECOME GIANT EMERGENCY CENTERS AND SO MORE OF THEIR VOLUME COMES THROUGH THE E. D. SO- WE DID A STUDY THAT SHOWED HOSPITALS WHEN THEY- EVEN IF THEY CANCEL THEIR CONTRACTS. THEY KEEP HALF OF THE EMERGENCY VALUE EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE NOT IN THE NETWORK. AND THEN THEY COULD CHARGE FULL BILLS BILL CHARGES AND SO THAT PUTS TREMENDOUS PRESSURE ON THE PLANTS TO SAY OKAY WE CAN'T AFFORD TO LET THIS HOSPITAL OUT OF THE NETWORK BECAUSE THEY'RE GONNA COME BACK INSTEAD OF IT BEING A FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR BILL. FREDDIE OUR VISIT COULD BE FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO PAY. SO THAT IS IF YOU WANTED TO CUT COSTS. YOU LIMITED AND WE DIDA STUDY OF THIS A HUNDRED AND 60% OF THE COST OF A- FOR EACH POSSIBLE YOU LIMIT THEIR ER PRICE. FOR OUT OF NETWORK SAVE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN CALIFORNIA OVERNIGHT. JUST FROM THAT CHANGE. THANK YOU MISTER MAYES HAD ANOTHER. AND WE MIGHT GETTING TO THIS A LITTLE BIT LATER BUT DOCUMENTED BECAUSE YOU BROUGHT UP THE HOSPITAL'S BECOME EMERGENCY CENTERS OUR MINDS ME OF- TOUR THAT I HAD DONE ONE OF MY SMALLER HOSPITALS IN MY DISTRICT. THE AND THE NUMBER OF- OF THE BEHAVIOR HEALTH. THAT PATIENTS- THAT THEY HAD MENTAL HEALTH OF PATIENTS- THAT THEY HAD. IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM AND HOW LONG THAT THEY WERE HAVING TO STAY. THERE CAN YOU ADDRESS- THAT A BIT WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT COSTS. IT HAS NOT BEEN STUDIED ENOUGH BUT THERE'S A CHANGING MIX. OF EDIE OF EIGHTY PATIENTS OVER TIME AND MENTAL HEALTH VISITS AND MENTAL HEALTH ADMISSIONS. HAVE BEEN TAKING AN INCREASING SHARE. OF THAT AND WE REALLY. REALLY HAVEN'T APPRECIATED THAT STUDY THAT AND FIGURED OUT HOW TO HANDLE THAT. CHANGE IN UTILIZATION EFFICIENTLY. MR THANK YOU THANK YOU DR RON- I HAVE A QUESTION A AND WANT TO GO BACK TWENTY SAID PUSH YOUR BUTTON THERE I IT'S PUSHED OUT OKAY I'M SORRY I HAVE MY MASK IN MY LITTLE BOYS DON'T TRAVEL WELL- SO. HAS THERE BEEN A STUDY ON HOW WHAT PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE WHO ARE UTILIZING THE EMERGENCY ROOM I KNOW IN MY DISTRICT WHICH IS. MORE CHALLENGE COMMUNITY- WE TEND. OUR FOLKS TEND TO USE THE EMERGENCY ROOM BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE REGULAR DOCTOR. AND SO I GUESS MY QUESTION WOULD BE AND THEY WILL WAIT FOR HOURS BECAUSE- THAT'S BETTER THAN WAITING FOR DAYS. NOW THAT THERE ARE TRULY SICK. WHAT PERCENTAGE AND THAT'S MY DISTRICT BUT WHAT PERCENTAGE YOU THINK OF HAS THERE BEEN STUDIES ON HOW MANY PEOPLE WHAT PERCENT OF PEOPLE ARE DOING USING THE EMERGENCY ROOM BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO PROPER HEALTH CARE. THAT BE MY FIRST QUESTION AND THEN MY SECOND QUESTION IS NOT YOU'VE IDENTIFIED YOUR AN IMPORTANT. DEFICIENCY IN OUR SYSTEM SO BASICALLY THERE ARE LITERALLY THOUSANDS OF VISITS IN THE E. D. WHERE PATIENTS ARE SUBSTITUTING THE E. D. WHICH IS A HIGHER LEVEL MORE EXPENSIVE LEVEL OF CARE. FOR WHAT COULD BE HANDLED. WITH A DOCTOR VISIT NOW THE GOOD NEWS IS IF WE LEVERAGE WHAT HAPPENED WITH TELEHEALTH DURING THE PANDEMIC. WE CAN ACTUALLY IMPROVE ACCESS- UP AND MAKE IT MORE ACCESSIBLE TO COMMUNITIES PARTICULARLY RURAL AREAS BUT ALSO OTHER COMMUNITIES WHERE THERE'S A SHORTAGE OF LOCAL DOCTORS TO TREAT THOSE PATIENTS SO THERE IS A POTENTIAL SILVER LINING- IF WE FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO IT CORRECTLY. AND THEN MY FOLLOW UP QUESTION WOULD BE IS THAT. IS THERE A BALANCING ACT BETWEEN IF ARE THERE STATES THAT HAVE ACTUALLY PUT THIS KIND OF LIMIT ON EMERGENCY ROOM COSTS- DO THEY BALANCE THAT OUT WITH REIMBURSEMENT SO THAT LOWER INCOME COMMUNITIES ACTUALLY. HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE ACCESS I MEAN IS THERE A BALANCING ACT THAT HAS TO BE DONE IF YOU WOULD DO ONE IS THERE ANY SORT OF SCALE THAT IS IN BALLOTS IF YOU DO ONE WITHOUT THE OTHER. WELL IF I UNDERSTAND YOUR QUESTION SO THE ONLY STATE THAT THAT HAS LIMITED. EMERGENCY OUT OF NETWORK HOSPITAL THERE ARE STATES THAT HAVE DONE POSITION BUT NOT THE HOSPITAL FEES THE ONLY STATE AS MARYLAND. AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE DATA IT'S AMAZING THEIR BILL CHARGES HAVE HARDLY GROWN. BECAUSE THERE'S NO REASON THE RAISE YOUR CHARGES BECAUSE YOU CAN'T GET THEM. HEY SO THE L. WHICH SHOWS THAT LIMITING THE NET PRICE THAT YOU WOULD GET FROM HIGH BILL CHARGES COULD BE AN EFFECTIVE MECHANISM. AS I MENTIONED WE STUDIED- WE DID A SIMULATION THAT SAID WE COULD PAY EVERY HOSPITAL CALIFORNIA IF THEY TREAT AN EMERGENCY PATIENT OUT OF NETWORK. WE COULD PAY THEM A HUNDRED AND THEM A 60% OFF OF MARGIN AND STILL. REDUCE THE LEVERAGE THAT LEADS TO THESE HIGH PRICES SYSTEM WHY SO WE YEAH WE HAVE THE POWER TO DO THAT IF WE KNOW IF WE HAVE SUPPORT TO DO IT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WE WILL GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON TO OUR SECOND PANEL NOW AND- WILL CALL FORTH A WE CAN WE CAN FIND I'M NOT SURE WHERE DR BENNETT OR BOND OR FITNESS. BUT DR KATE BOND OR IF IS AN ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF MEDICINE AND SENIOR FELLOW STANFORD INSTITUTE FOR ECONOMIC POLICY RESEARCH. AND SHE WILL BE TALKING TO US ABOUT. HEALTHCARE COSTS DRIVERS SO- AND THE MORE YOU IF YOU CAN SPEAK UP AS MUCH AS YOU CAN I KNOW THESE MASKS REALLY MUTE US AND- YOU KNOW MUTING CAN BE A NICE THING IF YOU GOT TO THROW VOIGTS BUT- SOMETIMES IT'S A LITTLE HARD TO HEAR SO- PLEASE GO AHEAD AND- SPEAK BOLDLY IF YOU CAN. THE WHENEVER YOU'RE A I WILL DO MY BEST TO SPEAK BOLDLY. I CAN THINK OF ANOTHER WORD TO. THINK OF ANOTHER WORD. SO THERE'S A LITTLE ECHO HERE FOR ME NOW. AND THAT MUCH MUCH MUCH BETTER OKAY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME I'M HERE TODAY TO TESTIFY ON THE TOPIC OF A HEALTHCARE COSTS DRIVERS. AN LET'S GO TO THE FIRST SLIDE PLEASE X. OKAY SO YOU FOLKS I I'VE BEEN ABLE TO HEAR SOME OF THE QUESTIONS ALTHOUGH NOT ALL OF THE QUESTIONS AND VERY FEW THE RESPONSES RIGHT SO I'LL TRY TO ADJUST. MY PRESENTATION ACCORDINGLY I'M GOING TO FOCUS MOSTLY ON THE NATIONAL LEVEL AND THINK ABOUT RESEARCH ON THE TOPIC OF HEALTH CARE COSTS GROWTH IN THE SOURCE OF HEALTHCARE COST GROWTH. SO FOLKS ARE PROBABLY FAMILIAR WITH THESE NUMBERS. ON MY SCREEN IS VERY BLURRY SO I ACTUALLY CAN'T EVEN SEE THEM BUT WE SPEND A LOT ON HEALTHCARE IN THE AGGREGATE AS A PERCENT SEVENTEEN POINT 7% OF GDP. AND NEARLY ARE OVER ELEVEN THOUSAND PER PERSON. SECOND FLIGHT. OUR NEXT SLIDE. OKAY ON THIS FIGURE AT YOU CAN SEE THE TRENDS IN HEALTH CARE EXPENDITURES PER CAPITA AS WELL AS I HEALTHCARE SPENDING AS A PERCENT OF GDP. SUIT IF YOU LOOK AT HEALTHCARE EXPENDITURES PER CAPITA NO SURPRISE AND HEALTH YOU KNOW THAT THE BIG ISSUE IN THE U. S. HEALTHCARE ECONOMY IS KIND OF THE-RELENTLESS RISE OF HEALTHCARE SPENDING PER CAPITA YEAR OVER YEAR IT GROWS THE LINE SHOWS US YOU KNOW WHAT SOME OF THE OTHERS SPEAKERS HAVE TALKED ABOUT. NOT ONLY IS HEALTHCARE SPENDING GROWING BUT IT'S GROWING AS A PERCENTAGE OF GDP SO WE'RE DEVOTING MORE OF OUR RESOURCES TO HEALTHCARE OVER TIME. ABOUT SLIGHTLY MORE SUBTLE POINT I WANNA MAKE WITH THIS AN WITH THE SLIDE IS TO REALLY THINK ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE. BETWEEN THE LEVEL AND THE GROWTH OF SPENDING. RIGHT SO IF WE LOOK AT THE LEVEL OF SPENDING AND IF WE THINK ABOUT AN INTERVENTION. THAT DECREASED THE LEVEL OF SPENDING IN A GIVEN YEAR. THAT WOULD BE NICE WE WOULD REDUCE OUR HEALTHCARE COSTS COULD. REDUCE THEIR HEALTHCARE COSTS FOR THAT YEAR. BUT THAT'S NOT REALLY GOING TO SOLVE OUR PROBLEM THAT'S GOING TO IF WE DON'T ADDRESS THE COST GROWTH WE'RE GOING TO BE SPENDING FROM A WE'RE GOING TO RESUME TO OUR OLD LEVELS OF HEALTHCARE COST GROWTH. FROM THAT NEW LOWER LEVEL SO ECONOMIST THINK ABOUT THAT WELL THAT'S A ONE TIME FIX BUT AS A ONE TIME INTERVENTION WHAT WE'RE REALLY LOOKING FOR IT WHEN WE THINK ABOUT HEALTHCARE COSTS IS HOW CAN WE SLOW THE RATE OF GROWTH OF HEALTH EXPENDITURES. NEXT SLIDE. OKAY AND WHAT HOW AND I'D LIKE YOU TO IT- I'D LIKE TO ENCOURAGE YOU TO THINK ABOUT THE COST PROBLEM. YOU KNOW MAYBE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY THAN YOU THOUGHT ABOUT BEFORE WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE COST PROBLEM I THINK OF TWO PROBLEMS. THE FIRST IS A VALUE PROBLEM AND THE SECOND IS THE AFFORDABILITY PROBLEM. SO THE VALUE PROBLEM IS THE FOLLOWING SO WHEN WE THINK ABOUT OUR HEALTH CARE SPENDING WHAT WE REALLY WANT TO THINK ABOUT IS DOES THE BENEFIT THAT WE GAIN FROM HEALTH CARE EXCEED THE PRODUCT COST US OF PRODUCING THOSE SERVICES. SO WE WANT TO THINK ABOUT KIND OF OUR BANG FOR OUR BUCK WHAT ARE WE GETTING FROM HEALTH CARE SPENDING. IN THIS IS AN IMPORTANT CONCEPT IN THE U. S. HEALTHCARE SYSTEM BECAUSE- YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT. TONS OF PHENOMENAL YOU KNOW THINGS TECHNOLOGY SERVICES THAT ARE GOOD FOR PATIENTS. BUT WE'VE ALSO GOT YOU KNOW OTHER THINGS WE HAVE LOTS OF EVIDENCE OF WHAT PEOPLE CALL LOW VALUE CARE RATES SO THAT. CARE FOR WHICH THE COST YOU EITHER SLIGHTLY OR VASTLY EXCEEDS THE BENEFITS- AND WE ALSO HAVE LOTS OF EVIDENCE OF NOT PROVIDING HIGH VALUE CARE. SO OUR COST PROBLEM IS NOT REALLY A PROBLEM OF JUST LIKE DOING LESS OR SPENDING LESS IT'S DEEPER THAN THAT AND YOU KNOW UNFORTUNATELY IT'S A LITTLE BIT HARDER THAN THAT IT'S KIND OF. RE ORGANIZING OUR CARE TO MOVE AWAY FROM LOW VALUE CARE AND TOWARDS HIGH VALUE CARE. I'LL GIVE YOU SOME EXAMPLES OF THAT IN THE NEXT SLIDE. THE PROBLEM YOU KNOW IF WE PULL THE COST PROBLEM APART AND YOU'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT THIS ALREADY THIS MORNING AND SOME YOU KNOW GREAT EXAMPLES OF THIS. IS YOU KNOW IT OUR ISSUES OF AFFORDABILITY SO THE THOUGHT EXPERIMENT I'D LIKE YOU TO YOU KNOW CONSIDER. IS YOU KNOW I TALKED IN THE LAST SIDE ABOUT- WHAT WE REALLY WANT TO DO IS SLOW THE RATE OF GROWTH OF HEALTH CARE SPENDING. NOW I'M SAYING WE WANT TO DO IN A GOOD WAY INA WAY THAT PRESERVES VALUE. BUT EVEN IF WE SLOW THE RATE OF GROWTH OF HEALTH CARE SPENDING WE'RE STILL GONNA HAVE AFFORDABILITY PROBLEM RIGHT SO RIGHT NOW YOU KNOW HE HAD WITH MANY EXAMPLES OF THIS FROM THAT FROM THAT LET YOU KNOW LAST DAM- FROM THE LAST PRESENTATION. YOU KNOW THE AVERAGE PREMIUM IN THE U. S. FOR FAMILY COVERAGE JUST WENT OVER TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS THE MEDIAN INCOME IN THE U. S. A SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. EVEN IF WE CAN SLOW THE RATE OF GROWTH OF HEALTHCARE SPENDING TOMORROW WE'RE STILL GONNA HAVE THIS AFFORDABILITY PROBLEM WE STILL HAVE TO MAINTAIN. WAYS TO KEEP PEOPLE ON. YOUR PROTECT THEM FROM THE FINANCIAL RISK OF HEALTHCARE SPENDING. OKAY NEXT FLIGHT PLEASE. OKAY SO I WANT. YOU TO GIVE YOU SOME EXAMPLES OF VALUE OR IF IT REALLY YOU KNOW THINK THROUGH THIS VALUE ISSUE. I DO WANT TO PREFACE MY COMMENTS BY GIVING YOU EXAMPLES OF THAT PARTICULAR SERVICES. AND I AM NOT ADVOCATING FOR EXAMPLE A BAN ON THE ANNUAL EXAM. I'M TRYING TO MAKE YOU KIND OF THINK THROUGH- HOW WE COULD DO YOU PRIMARY CARE EXAMS BETTER OKAY SO THAT MAY BECOME A LITTLE MORE CLEAR AFTER I GO THROUGH THIS BUT- YOU KNOW WHY I'M NOT REALLY FOCUSING ON. ANY OF THESE PARTICULAR SERVICES FOR. A SPECIFIC POLICY BUT JUST TO DEMONSTRATE A CONCEPT. OKAY SO WHAT HOW DO WE THINK ABOUT VALUE SO WE CAN THINK ABOUT THE TYPES OF HEALTH CARE WE PROVIDE. AN ARRAY IT ALONG TWO DIMENSIONS WE CAN THINK ABOUT WHETHER. IT'S EFFECTIVE OR NOT YOU KNOW DOESN'T WORK OR DOESN'T IT. AND WE CAN THINK ABOUT WHETHER IT'S CHEAPER EXPENSIVE. RIGHT AND THINGS THAT ARE NOT EFFECTIVE. WE PROBABLY DON'T WANT TO DO. RIGHT SO I'M GONNA PUT THE- AND WE DON'T WANT TO DO THEN EVEN IF THEY'RE CHEAP. SO I'M GONNA PUT THE ANNUAL EXAM FOR HEALTHY PEOPLE. IN THAT BUCKET THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS NOT PARTICULARLY EXPENSIVE. BUT ALL THE EVIDENCE WE HAVE SUGGESTS. THAT IT'S NOT PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE. THIS IS ONE THAT REALLY. STRIKES AT THE HEART OF PEOPLE THEY FEEL VERY PROTECTIVE OF THE ANNUAL EXAM. SO I'M NOT SAYING YOU SHOULDN'T GO TO YOUR DOCTOR AND SAYING. AN ANNUAL EXAM FOR PEOPLE ARE HEALTHY AND DON'T HAVE CON- YOU KNOW CHRONIC CONDITIONS AND- ARE GETTING MAYBE THE RECOMMENDED SCREENINGS YOU KNOW THROUGH OTHER MECHANISMS. WE HAVE VERY LITTLE EVIDENCE THAT THIS ANNUAL EXAM IS A IS A WORTHWHILE. MAYBE WE WANT TO REDO THE ANNUAL EXAM FOCUS THE ANNUAL EXAM USE THE ANNUAL EXAM BETTER BUT AND IT'S YOU KNOW KIND OF CURRENT FORM- IT IS AT. A LOW VALUE SERVICE. WE HAVE SERVICES THAT ARE NOT EFFECTIVE AND THEY ARE EXPENSIVE THOSE ARE THINGS THAT WE WANT TO GET- WOULD WONDER WHO REALLY THINK TWICE ABOUT. YOU CAN THINK ABOUT PCI- FOR PEOPLE WITH STABLE ORDINARY ARTERY DISEASE. IF ARE HAVE A HEART ATTACK IN MANY SITUATIONS YOU SHOULD ABSOLUTELY GET THIS AND THIS WILL SAVE YOUR LIFE. BUT IF YOU'RE NOT IF YOU HAVE SYMPTOMS OF CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE THERE IS A VERY LARGE CLINICAL TRIAL THAT SUGGESTED THAT OUTCOMES FOR THESE PATIENTS GETTING THIS EXPENSIVE PROCEDURE. WERE NOT BETTER THAN AND OUTCOMES FOR PATIENTS WHO DIDN'T GET THE PROCEDURE SO THAT'S AN EXAMPLE OF SOMETHING THAT'S EFFECTIVE. I'M SORRY THAT IS NOT VERY EFFECTIVE IN IS EXPENSIVE YOU KNOW SEEMS LIKE THOSE ARE THE TYPES OF THINGS WE'D LIKE TO DO LESS OF. IT WE CAN ALSO THINK ABOUT THINGS THAT ARE. EFFECTIVE AND CHEAP SO A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THIS IS SCREENING FOR COLORECTAL CANCER CANCER WE HAVE MANY DIFFERENT MODALITIES OR SEVERAL DIFFERENT MODALITIES FOR SCREENING FOR COLORECTAL CANCER. THERE IS A FICKLE BASED ATTESTED THAT IS VERY CHEAP VERY EFFECTIVE IT'S ONE OF THE VERY FEW PREVENTIVE SERVICES. THAT IS ACTUALLY COST SAVING. WHAT DO WE DO IN THE U. S. WE ASK THAT WE ACTUALLY DO COLONOSCOPY WHICH IS ACTUALLY. IT'S EFFECTIVE AND IT IS EVEN BY. A RELEVANCE AT AT METRICS COST EFFECTIVE. BUT IT'S NOT COST SAVING LIKE THE OTHER TESTS RIGHT SO EVEN IN THE C. WHERE WE HAVE. A AND EFFECTIVE SERVE. WE OFFER TO USE THEM. AND THEN RE WHETHER HITS ROAD IN THE DIFFICULT THIS. ARE ARE THINGS THAT IF. IN THEIR- RIGHT SO PROBLEM DRUG PERHAPS WERE THE BEST EXAMPLE OF THIS INCREDIBLY EFFECTIVE. INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE IN THOSE ARE DIFFICULT DECISIONS THAT THAT THAT WE NEED TO MAKE. OKAY NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. OKAY SO THERE IS A- I'LL YOU LISTEN ABOUT WHAT DRIVES GROWTH IN HEALTHCARE SPENDING THERE IS A IN AN ACADEMIC LITERATURE. LOOKING AT OVER THE LONG RUN WHAT DRIVES GROWTH IN HEALTHCARE SPENDING AND REMEMBER WE'RE NOT THINKING ABOUT LEVELS WERE THINKING ABOUT GROWTH RIGHT ARCHITECT BUT THE GROUP. GROWTH IS THE THING THAT WE REALLY CARE ABOUT. AND I THINK THE ACADEMIC LITERATURE IS SURPRISING TO FOLKS AND HOW AND WHAT IS THIS LITERATURE LOOK LIKE WELL. WHEN IN THE ACADEMIC THEY LOOK AT YOU KNOW TRENDS OVER TIME AND- HEALTH CARE SPENDING. AND THEN THEY LOOK AT THE THINGS THAT THEY CAN MEASURE RIGHT LIKELY WHAT ARE THE PRIMARY CULPRITS WATER THAT. YOU KNOW THINGS THAT PEOPLE POINT TO IN THE CONTEXT OF A HEALTHCARE COST GROWTH WILL BEGIN TO GET THE AGING OF THE POPULATION YOU KNOW CHANGES IN PRICE INCREASES IN INSURANCE- HE HAS IT TO A CERTAIN EXTENT THINGS ABOUT. ABOUT YOU KNOW THAT IF WE CAN MEASURE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS WE CONTROL FOR THE THINGS THAT WE CAN MEASURE. AND THEN WE SEE HOW MUCH IS LEFT IN THE RESIDUAL. AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE SLIDE YOU CAN SEE THERE SEVERAL DIFFERENT STUDIES IN SEVERAL OF THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE OFTEN TALK ABOUT. FOR EXAMPLE THE AGING OF THE POPULATION. OVER THAT TIME. WHICH WERE IN ADMITTEDLY WAS A WHILE AGO AGING OF THE POPULATION ACTUALLY HAD A VERY SMALL CONTRIBUTION TO GROWTH AND HEALTH CARE SPENDING. INCREASES IN INSURANCE RIGHT LIKE. THE ACT THAT YOU KNOW ADDING ONE MORE INSURANCE PERSON TO THE INSURANCE ROLES- IN THE SPREAD OF THIRD PARTY PAYMENT HAD A RELATIVELY SMALL CONTRIBUTION TO HEALTH CARE SPENDING. WHAT THAT'S THE SAME THING AS SAYING WELL THE RESIDUAL WAS VERY LARGE THE PORTION WE COULDN'T EXPLAIN IS VERY LARGE. AND HOW IT WOULD HOW COMMON IS THINK ABOUT THAT IS YOU KNOW WE KIND OF PUT THIS IN A BUCKET OF TECHNOLOGY. THAT'S BASICALLY SAYING WE'RE DOING MORE STUFF WE HAD NEW THINGS WE HAVE NEW SERVICES.% AND WE ARE TAKING THIS THING SERVICES AND APPLYING THEM AND USING THEM IN NEW WAYS NEW POPULATION NEW PEOPLE ETCETERA RIGHT SO THE RESIDUALS TECHNOLOGY. AND MANY OF THE STUDIES AGREE. THAT THE THAT THAT TECH NOT THAT BIG TECHNOLOGY BUCKET IS THE BIGGEST CON. CONTRIBUTOR TO HEALTH CARE SPENDING. OKAY SO IT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE DATES ON THE STUDIES YOU'LL BE LIKE OH THOSE ARE VERY OLD STUDIES KATE- AND- YOU KNOW YOU WOULD BE RIGHT TO SAY THAT. I DO WANT TO POINT OUT TWO THINGS WHICH I THINK ARE OF GROWING IMPORTANCE I THINK THE- THRUST OF THIS LITERATURE. IS A RIGHT RIGHT IN THE SENSE THAT IT'S STILL TECHNOLOGY IT'S SILL WERE DOING MORE STUFF- BUT THE TWO FACTORS THAT I THINK ARE- YOU KNOW A LITTLE BIT MORE IMPORTANT NOW. ONE IS THE AGING OF THE POPULATION IF YOU REALLY LOOK CLOSELY AT THE- AT. THE FORECAST FOR MEDICARE SPENDING YOU CAN SEE THIS STORY OVER TIME- THE ACTUARIES WHO FORECAST MEDICARE SPENDING- ARE ATTRIBUTING A GREATER PORTION OF SPENDING GROWTH TO THE- AGING OF THE POPULATION. IT'S STILL CERTAINLY DOESN'T WORK THAT TECHNOLOGY ARGUMENT BUT IT'S BECOMING MORE IMPORTANT. ON THE OTHER THING THAT I THINK IS VERY IMPORTANT TOUCH ON A LITTLE BIT MORE IN THIS PRESENTATION AND I THINK YOU'VE ALREADY HAD A LITTLE BIT DISCUSSION. OF DISCUSSION ON IS PRICES. RIGHT SO PRICES I THINK YOU DO TO CONSULT INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION. UP PRICES ARE. GROWING IN WAYS THAT THEY WERE NOT GROWING DURING THAT TIME. OF THE STATE. ON SLIDE PLEASE. OKAY A. I. MANAGING OF MANY OF YOUR PANELISTS WILL HAVE THEIR FAVORITE MARKET CONSOLIDATION SLIDE AND HERE'S MINE- THIS IS RESEARCH THAT I'VE DONE WITH MY- COLLEAGUES AND DAN KESSLER AND LAUREN BAKER BOTH ALSO AT SANFORD. AND WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT HERE IS- MARKET CONSOLIDATION AND HOSPITAL SPENDING N. THIS PAPER THE FOCUS OF THIS PAPER WAS VERTICAL INTEGRATION HOSPITAL'S MERGING- WITH- HOSPITALS IN A MERGING OR PURCHASING PHYSICIAN PRACTICES AND THAT BAR ON THE LEFT YOU CAN SEE THAT SAY A PERCENTAGE PRICING CHANGE FOR A ONE PERCENTAGE- ONE STANDARD DEVIATION INCREASE. IN THAT IN VERTICAL AND CONSOLIDATION IN A HEALTH CARE MARKET LEADS TO HIGHER SPENDING REMEMBER SPENDING IS PRICE TIMES QUANTITY SO EITHER OF THOSE THINGS COULD BE GOING UP THERE. TO GO OVER TO THAT RIGHT BAR THE LIGHT BLUE BAR THAT IS COMPARING DEACON VERTICAL CONSOLIDATION TO HORIZONTAL CONSOLIDATION TO HOSPITALS GETTING TOGETHER AND MERGING AND YOU KNOW HORIZONTAL CONSOLIDATION ALSO IN A HAS A VERY BIG THAT AFFECT ON PRICES. WHEN YOU GO OVER TO THE RIGHT A YOU CAN SEE THE EFFECT AND QUANTITY THE LAST FIGURE WITH PRICE TIMES QUANTITY SPENDING GOING UP THE RIGHT IS QUANTITY ONLY- THIS IS BASICALLY SAYING WELL THE RELATIVELY LITTLE EFFECT AND QUANTITY OF THESE TYPES OF CHANGES IN PROVIDER ORGANIZATION AND MARKETS SO YOU KNOW KIND OF BY DEFAULT IT LOOKS LIKE IT WAS PRICES. RIGHT SO THERE ARE LOTS OF THE GROWING LITERATURE LOTS OF STUDIES THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT PROBLEM FOR A HEALTH CARE SYSTEM NOW IN PART BECAUSE ONCE WE DO CONSOLIDATION IT'S HARD TO DO IT RIGHT S OF THE CONSOLIDATION INSPECTS AFFECTS SOME PRICES IMPORTANT WHEN NO I WANT TO MAKE ON THIS STUDY IS THAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS- AND IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT AND THINKING ABOUT- HOSPITAL CONSOLIDATION IN HOSPITAL INTEGRATION. ALSO TO THINK ABOUT OUT ASIAN HOSPITAL SERVICES THERE'S A LAW OF ACTION THERE TO WELL. A NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. OKAY SO HERE I WANNA I WANNA MAKE A POINT ABOUT- EXPANSIONS INSURANCE AND INSURANCE COVERAGE AN OUT OF POCKET SPENDING SO WHAT I'VE DONE HERE IS I'VE PLOTTED- NATIONAL HEALTH EXPENDITURES BY A FUNDING SOURCE AND ON THE BOTTOM IN THAT GRAY AND- I ON IN THOSE GRAY BARS YOU CAN SEE THE PROPORTION OF HEALTH CARE EXPENDITURES THAT ARE FUNDED OUT OF POCKET. N. I MEAN WHO AT THIS IS A VERY LONG TIME PERIOD I THINK THAT NUMBER OVER THERE AND THE LEFT ISN'T EARLY NINETEEN SIXTIES AND YOU CAN SEE THAT PROPORTION OF HEALTH EXPENDITURES THAT IS FUNDED BY OUT OF POCKET PAYMENTS NON INSURED PAYMENTS HAS ACTUALLY BEEN DECLINING OVER TIME SO THE DECLINE HAS BEEN LESS DRAMATIC IN RECENT YEARS. BUT IT'S BEEN DECLINING- AT THE SAME TIME WE'VE HAD PRETTY DRAMATIC INCREASES OVER TIME- IN THE PROPORTION OF EXPENDITURES THIS ISN'T THE PORTION OF PEOPLE THIS IS A PROPORTION OF EXPENDITURES THEY'RE COVERED BY EITHER PUBLIC OR PRIVATE INSURANCE AND IF YOU YOU KNOW SQUINT REALLY HARD AT THAT YOU CAN SEE THAT MAYBE THERE'S A SLIGHTLY BIGGER INCREASE AND- PUBLIC INSURANCE. AND PRIVATE INSURANCE DURING THIS TIME RIGHT SO THIS IS THIS LITTLE BIT SURPRISING TO PEOPLE BECAUSE WE HEAR A LOT ABOUT OUT OF POCKET PAYMENTS AND THAT IS ABSOLUTELY IMPORTANT OURSELVES A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT ON THE NEXT SLIDE IT'S ABSOLUTELY IMPORTANT BUT REALLY ARE OUT OF AND ANOTHER THING I WANT TO MAKE A POINT I WANT TO MAKE ABOUT THE SLIDE IS WHEN I SAY OUT OF POCKET PAYMENTS THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE INSURED AND PAY FOR SOME OF THEIR SERVICES OUT OF POCKET. AS WELL AS PEOPLE WHO ARE UNINSURED RIGHT SO THERE'S A MIX BETWEEN BENEFIT GENEROSITY AND HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR EXAMPLE BENEFIT GENEROSITY COULD BE DECLINING AND MORE PEOPLE ARE GETTING HEALTH INSURANCE AND THAT COULD BE AN OFFSETTING EACH OTHER AND IN INTERESTING WAYS. BUT THE POINT I WANT TO MAKE HERE IS THAT YOU KNOW WE TALK A LOT ABOUT OUT OF POCKET SPENDING IN OUT OF POCKET SPENDING IS ACTUALLY EITHER. AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL HEALTH EXPENDITURE IS THAT GOING TO SO. MAY THINGS STATE IN RECENT YEARS. THE BIG PROBLEM THE ELEPHANT IN THIS ROOM IS TOTAL SPENDING- I AND I'M NOT SAYING OUT OF POCKET EXPENSE SPENDING IS NOT IMPORTANT FOR CONSUMERS. BUT I'M SAYING THE THING THAT IS DRIVING OUT OF POCKET SPENDING FOR CONSUMERS IS TOTAL SPENDING. OKAY NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. OKAY THIS KIND OF MAKES THE SAME POINT CERVANTES TOO QUICKLY THIS IS BASICALLY SHOWING THAT YOU KNOW OUT OF POCKET EXPENDITURES ARE OUR PER CAPITA INDEED ARE GOING UP AT THE SAME TIME THE SHARE OF A EXPENDITURES FINANCE OUT OF POCKET IS GOING DOWN ONCE AGAIN THAT'S BECAUSE HEALTH CARE EXPENDITURES PER CAPITA ARE GROWING SO QUICKLY. EXIDE PLEASE. AND OKAY SO I WANT TO JUST TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE DISTRIBUTION OF SPENDING BY SECTOR YOU KNOW HERE WE HAD THE BIG THREE ARE REALLY HOSPITAL SERVICES AND OFTEN PEOPLE ARE SAYS SURPRISE AT THE LARGE SHARE SPENDING DEVOTED TO HOSPITAL SERVICES IT SOUNDS FROM THE QUESTIONS I COULD HEAR THAT YOU GUYS PROBABLY ARE NOT THAT SURPRISED. BY THAT PHYSICIAN SERVICES ALSO IMPORTANT PHARMACEUTICALS REPRESENT ABOUT 10% OF HEALTHCARE EXPENDITURES THAT IS FOCUSED ON RETAIL PHARMACEUTICALS AND INJECTABLES ARE IMPORTANT ALSO BUT THEY DON'T SHOW UP IN THAT PHARMACEUTICALS AND PIECE OF THE PIE BECAUSE THEY OUGHT TO SHOW UP IN EITHER THE HOSPITAL OR THE PHYSICIAN. SERVICES ON IT'S HARD TO GET GREAT DATA ON WHAT PROPORTION OF HOSPITAL OR PHYSICIAN SERVICES YOU KNOW HOW ARE DEVOTED TO- INJECTABLE AND OTHER TYPES OF DRUGS THAT YOU WOULD GET IN- A HOSPITAL OR PHYSICIAN'S SETTING- BUT SOME PEOPLE OF ESTIMATED THAT MAYBE THAT BRINGS UP THE PHARMACEUTICAL SHARE AT TWO FIFTEEN YOU KNOW SOME PEOPLE SAY 20% IT HARD TO GET GRADED ON THAT. CAN EXCITE. OKAY HERE I JUST WANNA TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE GROWTH RATE AND GROW YOU KNOW ONCE AGAIN. I STARTED BY SAYING THE GROWTH RATE IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE LEVELS- THAT IS A TRUE HERE YOU CAN SEE IN OF TRENDS AND THE GROWTH RATE OVER TIME. THE NINETIES WAS A PERIOD OF LARGE INCREASES IN THE- ORDER RAPIDLY RISING EXPENDITURES FOR PHARMACEUTICALS- THE CURRENTS AND A GROWTH RATES ARE OVER THERE. ON THE RIGHT IT'S NE THING TO KEEP IN MIND AS WELL THE GROWTH RATE OF THESE THINGS HAS ANOTHER ROUGHLY IN A SIMILAR THEY DON'T TO OF EACH OF THESE SECTORS. BUT WHEN WE APPLY A SIMILAR GROWTH RATE ON A VERY LARGE BASE A VERY LARGE BASE OF HOSPITAL SPENDING FOR EXAMPLE. THAT AND TRANSLATES INTO A LOT OF DOLLARS RIGHT SO A GOOD AS A YOU KNOW A GROWTH RATE ON A SMALL SHARE RELATIVE TO A GROWTH RATE ON A LARGE SHARE THE SAME GROWTH RATE ON A LARGE SHARE. MEANS A DIFFERENT THING FOR OVERALL SPENDING. OKAY NEXT SLIDE PLAY. AND HERE IS SOME INFORMATION THAT THE- THE NATIONAL X. HEALTH EXPENDITURES FOLKS PUT TOGETHER TRYING TO KINDA DECOMPOSE IN TO ODD THAT THE HEALTHCARE COST GROWTH INTO ONCE AGAIN AGING OF THE POPULATION PRICE AND QUANTITY AND YOU CAN SEE IN A KIND OF IN THE NINETIES OVER THERE ON THE LEFT ESPECIALLY THAT SECOND BAR FROM THE LEFT YOU KNOW THERE IS A PERIOD OF RELATIVELY LOW HEALTH CARE COSTS GROWTH. BUT DURING THAT TIME IT'S INTERESTING WHAT HEAD YOU KNOW WHAT HEAD- PRICES WERE STILL GROWING BUT QUANTITY WASN'T RATE ONCE WE EMERGED INTO A TIME PERIOD WHERE HEALTHCARE SPENDING GROWTH TOOK OFF AGAIN WE WERE MOVING MOVING MORE TOWARD MORE TOWARDS QUANTITY AND ONCE AGAIN THAT IS YOU KNOW QUANTITY IS A BIG BROAD CATEGORY OF STUFF GRADING OF NEW STUFF- EXISTING AND NEW APPLICATIONS FOR EXISTING PROCEDURES AND BILLS ETCETERA I DO WANT TO ADD ONCE AGAIN BRING ATTENTION TO ASIAN THE POPULATION YOU KNOW IMPORTANT BUT NOT INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AND. AND RELATIVE TO THESE OTHER FACTORS. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. OKAY SO- YOU KNOW WHAT CAN WE DO WELL AND YOU KNOW WE NEED TO FOCUS ON- YOU KNOW WHAT WE NEED TO FOCUS ON- QUANTITY AND THINKING ABOUT YOU KNOW HOW WE CAN MOVE AWAY FROM WE CAN MOVE TOWARD A HIGH VALUE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IN A VERY SIMPLE WAY- AS I'VE DRAWN ON THE SLIDE RIGHT THERE ARE. THERE ARE PATIENTS AND PEOPLE THERE ARE PAIRS AS OUR ROUGHLY INSURERS ARE MEDICARE MEDICAID AL ON IN THEIR PROVIDERS WE REALLY HAVE THREE PLACES THAT WE CAN INTERVENE RIGHT WE CAN WE CAN THINK ABOUT HOW- THAT CONSUMERS ARE CHOOSING HEALTH PLANS RIGHT SO THAT'S IN THE UPPER LEFT HAND CORNER. WE WANT TO THINK ABOUT INCENTIVES FOR CHEETAH FOLKS TO CHOOSE HIGH VALUE COVERAGE WITH PREMIUMS SIGNALS WE CAN THINK ABOUT- HOW WE PAID PROVIDERS THAT'S THE RELIEF OVER THERE ON THE TOP RIGHT THAT'S THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PAYERS AND PROVIDERS WE CAN INTERVENE THERE TO CREATE INCENTIVES TO DELIVER HIGH VALUE CARE AND THEN WE CAN THINK ABOUT THE BOTTOM WE CAN THINK ABOUT HOW PATIENTS INTERACT WITH THEIR HEALTH PLANS AND THINK ABOUT THE INCENTIVES THAT WE'RE GIVING TO PATIENTS TO USE HIGH VALUE SERVICES. OF COURSE PEOPLE WOULD WEIGH THESE DIFFERENT MECHANISMS THE IMPORTANCE OR THAT YOU KNOW EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE DIFFERENT YOU KNOW TYPES OF MECHANISMS DIFFERENTLY- BUT YOU KNOW THOSE ARE KIND OF THE CHOICES THAT WE HAVE ON THE TABLE. X. SLIDE PLEASE. OKAY SO IF I A N. ADDISON US SUMMARIZE I BASICALLY WANT TO REINFORCE THIS IDEA THAT I THINK YOU KNOW WE WANT TO SEE IS THAT IT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE COST PROBLEM BUT AS A VALUE PROBLEM AND AFFORDABILITY PROBLEM AND IF WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TOWARD VALUE WE HAVE TO DO YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE INCENTIVES INTACT CENTER FACING INSURERS WOULD HAVE TO ADD THE SENTENCES FACING PROVIDERS AN INCENTIVE FACING CONSUMERS- IN A RISING MARKET CONCENTRATION I THINK IS A PROBLEM IN PRICES SENATE FOCUSED ON THAT. BUT I THINK IT'S ALSO A PROBLEM BECAUSE IT MAY IT CREATES A BARRIER PUTS A LOT OF POWER IN THE HANDS OF- OF PROVIDER ORGANIZATIONS AND EVEN INSURERS- TO THAT YOU KNOW TO PUSH BACK AGAINST THE TYPES OF CHANGES THAT WOULD MOVE US TOWARD A MORE HIGH VALUE SYSTEM- AND THEN OF COURSE WE NEED TO ADD SUBSIDIES TO MAKE HEALTH CARE AFFORDABLE BUT YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO ACTUALLY REALLY THINK ABOUT THE DESIGN OF SUBSIDIES- IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT THE WAY WE'RE SUBSIDIZING CONSUMERS AND THE AREA. OF HEALTHCARE IS PROMOTING HIGH VALUE CARE. THANK YOU. WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT THAT- PRESENTATION AND WITH A LOT OF REALLY VALUABLE INFORMATION LIKE TO SEE IF THERE MIGHT QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE I THINK WERE THEY WERE ABSORBING A LOT HERE SO. PLEASE SEMICIRCULAR CURRY THANK YOU VERY MUCH GOOD PRESENTATION I AM ASKING THE QUESTIONS A LITTLE OFF- A BECAUSE I REPRESENT RURAL AREAS AND I'M CONCERNED ABOUT ACOSTA KEEPS COMING UP. AND I KEEP GETTING ASKED AND. REGULATIONS FOR HOSPITALS ARE ESTIMATED BY RAN TO COST MORE THAN A HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS. DO YOU BELIEVE THIS EXPENSE WOULD BE BORNE BY HEALTH CARE CONSUMERS AND WOULD THIS BE CONSIDERED AS A MAJOR HEALTH CARE COST DRIVER. PLEASE THAT IS A GREAT QUESTION- I DON'T AND I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION- I THINK YOU KNOW AS AN ECONOMIST I WILL SAY- DEFINITIVELY IT DEPENDS- AND WHAT DOES IT DEPEND ON- I THINK IT DEPENDS ON YOU TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH PUBLIC SUBSIDIES ARE AVAILABLE FOR- HELPING HOSPITALS RESPOND TO THIS- AND- IF YOU KNOW HOSTAGE YOU KNOW IT AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH HOSPITALS HAVE TO- ED GENERATE THE FUNDS FOR RETROFITTING US THROUGH THE SALE OF SERVICES TO CONSUMERS THAN IT DEFINITELY WILL RAISE PRICES SO DEPENDS ON YOU. AS IN MOST THINGS I THINK IT DEPENDS ON WHO PAYS. THANK YOU THANK YOU AND THAT THAT UMBER IS A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS AS I RECALL THANK YOU SO IT'S A LARGE NUMBER. MISTER MASON. SO I REPRESENT AN AREA THAT'S- FAIRLY THE RULED BY ACTUALLY PART OF MY DISTRICT IS VERY REPEAT IT IS IT IS VERY RURAL- AND THERE IS OF ABOUT HALF OF MY DISTRICT POPULATION OF MY DISTRICT- THERE IS FOR HOSPITALS- AND THERE WAS TWO HOSPITALS THAT WERE. HAD CONTRACTED OUT WITH ONE PARTICULAR SYSTEM THE END OF THE RURAL COMMUNITY THAT I SERVE I HAD A PUBLIC HOSPITAL THEY JUST WEREN'T MAKING IT- AND- THE BOARD MADE THE DECISION A FEW YEARS AGO- TO. CALL YOU THE TERM CONSOLIDATE- WITH THAT THAT OTHER SYSTEM SO OF THE FOUR HOSPITALS THERE'S THREE. I'M HOSPITALS ARE NOW WITH THAT THAT THAT SYSTEM AND THE REASON WHY THE BOARD MADE THAT DECISION BECAUSE THERE'S A LACK OF PROVIDERS IN THOSE RURAL COMMUNITIES. AND THEY FOUND THAT THEY WOULD ACTUALLY GET BY HIGHER THAT THEY THOUGHT THEY WOULD GET HER HEALTH CARE MORE PROVIDERS OR ACCESS TO THOSE PROVIDERS. SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT COST DRIVERS HOW DO YOU FACTOR THE AREAS THAT ARE RURAL VERSUS THOSE THAT ARE MORE SUBURBAN TO URBAN WHERE THEY'RE MOST MORE PROVIDERS. TO THAT QUESTION MAKE SENSE. THAT QUESTION. YEAH I MEAN I THINK THERE'S A LOT GOING ON THERE I THINK ISSUES OF RURAL HEALTH CARE AND HOSPITAL AND COMPETITION ARE YOU PROBABLY TRICKY AND SOME OF THE MORE TRICKY AREAS WE HAVE BECAUSE YOU KNOW IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE YOU KNOW WHAT ARE THE LONG TERM TRENDS IN WHAT HOSPITALS DO HOSPITALS ARE REALLY MOVING THINGS TO OUTPATIENT CARE RATES SO- YOU KNOW MANY OF THE THINGS THAT WE STUDENT PATIENT YOU KNOW AND WE CAN NOW DO OUTPATIENT. SO IN SOME SENSE THAT'S GOOD YOU KNOW IN THE CONTEXT OF RURAL HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS BECAUSE MAYBE YOU KNOW THEY'RE LOWER FIXED COST TO ME WE CAN SUPPORT LARGER COMPETITION ARE MORE COMPETITION BUT IT DOES SUGGEST THAT YOU KNOW THERE'S A THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH COMPETITION- IN RURAL AREAS FOR ACUTE CARE SERVICES YOU KNOW SOME YOU KNOW WILL ALWAYS NEED WORK AT LEAST FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE WE WILL NEED SOME ACUTE CARE SERVICES AND YOU KNOW COMPETITION IT'S- IT'S TOUGH TO GENERATE ENOUGH SCALE AND HOSPITALS TO SUPPORT COMPETITION IN THESE AREAS SO. I MEAN I THINK THAT I WOULD SAY THAT I AM NOT AN EXPERT AND RURAL HEALTH BUT THAT DOES SEEM LIKE AN AREA IN WHICH- YOU KNOW POLICY COULD THINK ABOUT HOW TO- A SUPPORT HOSPITALS OR AT LEAST REGULATE HOSPITAL PRICES IN AREAS YOU KNOW ECONOMISTS WOULD CALL THAT A NATURAL MONOPOLY YOU KNOW IF THAT INDEED IS THE CASE WE MIGHT WANT TO THINK ABOUT. HOW TO TREAT THOSE HOSPITALS DIFFERENTLY. THANK I BELIEVE MISTER NAZARIAN HAS A QUESTION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR CAN YOU HEAR ME YES. OKAY AND THEN DOES THE PRESENTER ALSO HEAR ME. DR BHANDARI I DON'T THINK SO I'M GONNA DO MY BEST TO WRITE YOUR QUESTION DOWN. AN ADULT OKAY OKAY. SORRY MISTER CHAIR I GOT A FEW. ONE IT'S SO THE FIRST ONE IS ON THE- ON THE SLIDE THAT SAYS WHAT DRIVES GROWTH IN HEALTHCARE SPENDING. I'M LOOKING AT THE AGING POPULATION AT 2% IN TWO THOUSAND I'M JUST WONDERING WHAT WOULD THAT NUMBER BE IN TWENTY TWENTY GIVEN THAT IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS. WE'VE ALSO SEEN. SEEN AS SPIKE IN A LOT OF THE- DEGENERATIVE DISEASE. DISEASES AND THE COST AND CONSUMPTION THAT THAT. TAKES A AND THE TOLD THAT IT'S TAKING SO- I'M WONDERING IF THAT WE WOULD SEE OF MORRIS AT THAT DIFFERENT PERCENTAGE AND A GREATER CONTRIBUTION OF COST. OKAY THAT'S ONE I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO ASK THAT FIRST OR WHAT ROUTE ME TO CAN YOU ABOUT HOUSTON'S LET'S PUT THEM ALL TOGETHER AND I'M I'M WRITING NOTES AND THEN. WE'LL A WE'LL GO FROM THERE IF I SCREWED UP OKAY NAMA. TEXT TEXT ME. OKAY AND THEN AND THEN THE SECOND ONE IS ON THE TWO TWO SLIDES LATER- DISTRIBUTION OF NATIONAL HEALTH EXPENDITURES. WHERE WHERE WE'RE LOOKING AT THE COST SHARE CHANGING SINCE NINETEEN SIXTY TO TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN BETWEEN. THE OUT OF POCKET COSTS PUBLIC INSURANCE PRIVATE INSURANCE AND OTHER. WHAT I'M INTERESTED TO KNOW IS HOW DOES THIS COMPARE. TO OTHER ADVANCED COUNTRIES. GREAT QUESTION GREAT QUESTION OKAY SO I WILL. GO AHEAD AND- WHAT ONE LAST WELL AND THEN ONE LAST ONE ANY COULD BE EITHER ON THIS- THIS SLIDE FOR THE NEXT SLIDE BUT WHICH WHICH HAS TO DO WITH THE OUT OF POCKET COSTS WHERE SHOULD THE OUT OF POCKET COST B. MA'AM I'M A BELIEVER THAT THERE SHOULD BE. A SMALL COST BORN ON THE INDIVIDUAL. BECAUSE THAT ALSO KEEPS IN CHECK AND ACCOUNTABILITY THAT THAT INDIVIDUALS DON'T TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE SYSTEM SO THERE SHOULD BE A SMALL COST BUT OVER HERE IT SAYS BASICALLY IT'S AROUND. 10% RIGHT WHERE SHOULD IT ACTUALLY HE WHERE IT'S BEEN THE SUCCESS THAT WE'VE SEEN IN OTHER COUNTRIES THAT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ACHIEVE THAT. GREAT KEEP SUCCESS OKAY THANKS THANK YOU THANK YOU SO OKAY SPRING DR BEND OR BACK AND I'M GONNA DO MY BEST ON THESE QUESTIONS. OKAY SO WE'VE GOT THREE QUESTIONS FOR YOU. THE FIRST ONE IS- YOUR SLIDE THE SAYS WHAT DRIVES GROWTH IN HEALTHCARE SPENDING. AND WE'VE GOT- AGING OF THE POPULATION YOU GO FROM. NINETY TWO TO NINETY FIVE TO TWENTY TWO THOUSAND AND IT'S LIKE 2% EACH OF THOSE. WHERE YOU KNOW WHERE DO YOU SEE WHAT CAN YOU GIVE US AN IDEA WHERE YOU SEE THAT. NUMBER MIGHT BE IN TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY YEARS IS A LONG TIME AND WE HAVE AN AGING POPULATION SO DO YOU DO YOU SEE WHERE WHERE WOULD YOU SEE THAT PROJECT IN AN OBVIOUSLY WELL WE'RE NOT GONNA HOLD YOU TO IT. BUT BUT YOU KNOW GIVE US YOUR BEST SHOT AT IT. YEAH OKAY THANK YOU FOR NOT HOLDING ME TO THAT. BUT I DO HAVE I DO HAVE A SLIDE RIGHT SO I FEEL CONFIDENT THREE. REJECTION SO ONE OF THE SLIDES TOWARDS THE END- THERE WERE UPDATED NUMBERS I THINK THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN KIND OF YOU KNOW IS THAT SLIDE IN THE END WHERE WE DECOMPOSED- RIGHT AND COST GROWTH INTO. A PRICE QUANTITY AND AGING OF THE POPULATION. RATIO AND YOU KNOW I ACTUALLY CAN'T SEE MY SLIDES- SO I THINK IT WAS A VERY SMALL BAR YES THE ROLE KNOWN LICENSING. THANK YOU THIRTY GOOD AT. HELPING YOU WITH THAT NUMBER. YEAH THERE WE GO PERFECT THAT'S AWESOME YEAH SO I CAN SEE THE RED BAR BUT I CAN'T SEE THE POINT IS THAT LIKE LAKE. LAKE FIVE INCH FOUR INCH 66% DOWN THEIR- WAY OVER ON THE RIGHT. YEAH IT'S ACTUALLY YEAH IT'S ACTUALLY EVEN SMALLER THAN THAT BUT I THINK THAT THE IMPORTANT TREND THERE IS THAT IT SEEMS TO BE FAIRLY STABLE. THAT IS ISN'T IN OTHER WORDS THAT YES YOU KNOW IT'S SO AT THE ABSOLUTELY SO THAT WAS MY NEXT AT POINTS THAT'S THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND THEN YOU KNOW YOU KNOW DEBTS. AS YOU SAID IT'S BEEN PRETTY STABLE SO IT'S NT A HUGE LEAP OF FAITH TO THINK THAT IT WILL BE SIMILAR IN TWENTY TWENTY. OKAY THAT BEING SAID- I WANT TO MAKE TWO QUALIFICATIONS TO THAT SO. IF YOU GO AND YOU KNOW AND MAYBE I CAN SEND SOME OF THE STATE THAT AFTERWARDS AND YOU LOOK AT THE EXPENDITURES. FOR MEDICARE- DONE BY THE AND MEDICARE ACTUARIES. THEY FORECAST THAT FOR MEDICARE THIS THIS SHARE IS INCREASING RIGHT IT'S- YOU KNOW IT'S A YOU KNOW IT USED TO EXPLAIN YOU KNOW SO MAYBE 5210% OF MEDICARE AND MAYBE IT'S GOING UP TO FIFTEEN THOSE ARE. THOSE ARE BALLPARK NUMBERS THERE THAT'S WHERE I'M GONNA TAKE YOU UP ON YOUR OFFER OF YOU KNOW NOT. AN EXACT ESTIMATE THAT WILL SURELY A. B. AND COULD. AS WE GO FOR. BECAUSE THE- IS GOING TO AGE RAPIDLY THAN IT DID IN THE PAST. OKAY SO THAT'S ONE THING I WANNA SAY THE OTHER THING I THINK YOU MENTIONED NEUROSURGEON DIGITAL DEGENERATIVE DISEASES. THE OTHER THING IS A LITTLE TRICKY ABOUT THIS IS THAT. THE COMPOSITION OF THE POPULATION. WILL DRIVE WHAT TYPES OF TECHNOLOGIES ARE DEVELOPED IN THE FUTURE RIGHT SO YOU KNOW WE HAVE A LOT OF LITTLE ENTREPRENEURS AND BIG ENTREPRENEURS OUT THERE AND HEALTH CARE SYSTEM AND THEY'RE LOOKING AT THE POPULATION AGING AS WELL. SO YOU KNOW PEOPLE WILL BE INVESTING THEIR MONEY AND NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO TREAT OUR AGING POPULATION- AND THAT IS NOT OFTEN NOT DIRECTLY ACCOUNTED FOR IN THESE NUMBERS RIGHT SO- SO WE CAN THINK THAT MAYBE THAT THE AND THAT AND I GUESS WHAT I'M SAYING OR WHAT I AM SAYING. IS THAT THERE'S AN INTERACTION BETWEEN THE AGING OF POPULATION THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES. THAT WE HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND AND MAYBE THE AGING OF THE POPULATION WILL EITHER BE MORE IMPORTANT IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE OF THE INTERACTION. THE OTHER THING I WANT TO SAY THAT I ACTUALLY FORGOT TO SAY N. M. WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT THOSE STUDIES AND- A DAD YOU KNOW. A PULLED APART THE SOURCES OF HEALTH CARE COSTS GROWTH USING THE HISTORICAL DATA. IS INTO IT AS JUST AS THERE IS AN INTERACTION BETWEEN AGING OF THE POPULATION IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW TECHNOLOGY. THERE ISN'T INTERACTION BETWEEN INSURANCE COVERAGE AND THE DEVELOP OF NEW TECHNOLOGY SO ENTREPRENEURS OUT THERE SAYING OKAY SO. YOU KNOW WHEN MEDICARE AND EXPANDED HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR PHARMACEUTICALS TO AND- OLDER ADULTS WE SAW. A YOU KNOW A BURST OF. INNOVATION FOR DRUGS USED TO TREAT THE CONDITIONS THAT PRIMARILY ARE YEAH YOU KNOW RELEVANT FOR THESE OLDER ADULTS SO THE- INTERACT AND WHEN WE THINK OF LONG TERM COSTS GROWTH THE INTERACTION OF INSURANCE AND TECHNOLOGY IS ALSO IMPORTANT. AND SO THAT WAS THE FIRST. OKAY THREE YEAH THING THAT I COULD HEAR FUMBLE OF THEM. YEAH THE SECOND IS SHOULD I GO AHEAD AND ANSWERED YEAH THAT'S REGARDING THE DISTRIBUTION OF NATIONAL HEALTH EXPENDITURES. SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO OUT OF POCKET EXPENSE. AND HOW DOES THAT COMPARE TO WHAT WE SEE IN OTHER ADVANCED COUNTRIES. SO ARE NOT SO IT. YEAH GO AHEAD I'M SORRY. YEP YEP SO THAT'S THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION IT VARIES I WOULD SAY THAT WE TEND TO BE ON THE HIGHER SIDE OF OUT OF POCKET PAYMENTS THAN OTHER COUNTRIES OTHER THAT'S THAT'S NOT UNIVERSALLY TRUE GREAT SO BUT WE TEND TO BE ON THE HIGHER SIDE. WE HAVE HAD A- I WOULD SAY A BIGGER CHANGE OVER THAT LAST LONG TIME PERIOD RIGHT AS WE YOU KNOW A IN OTHER COUNTRIES EXTENDED. INSURANCE COVERAGE YOU KNOW PARTICULARLY YOU KNOW IN THE EIGHTIES AND WHATNOT EARLY TO A BROADER SET OF THE POPULATION EARLIER THAN WE DID RIGHT SO. MAYBE THE CHANGE HAS NOT BEEN AS DRAMATIC AND I THINK OUR LEVELS ARE A BIT HIGHER. ON IN PART BECAUSE JUST OUR EXPENDITURES ARE HIGHER SO IT'S A DIFFERENT THAT THIS THE DIFFERENCE IS MORE STRIKING IF YOU LOOK AT LEVELS OF HEALTHCARE SPENDING. THAT IF YOU LOOK AT THE PROPORTION OF HEALTH CARE EXPENDITURES FUNDED OUT OF POCKET. I'M RELATED TO THE I THINK IT WAS THE NEXT PART OF THAT QUESTION- YOU KNOW ONE POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS. OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE COUNTRY TO HAVE LOWER HEALTH CARE EXPENDITURES RELIED LESS. ON OUT OF POCKET EXPENDITURES DRESS ADDRESSED A DIRECTED WORKING TOWARD CONSUMERS. TO CONTROL HEALTH CARE COSTS RIGHT BUT THEY RELY AND OTHER MECHANISMS RIGHT THEY HAVE TIGHTER CONTROLS AT THE CENTRAL LEVEL. OR YOU KNOW THEY MAY BE- YOU KNOW HAVE DIFFERENT WAYS OF PRICING PHARMACEUTICALS AND MOVING PEOPLE TOWARD YOU KNOW LET YOU KNOW THAT MOVING. AT PEOPLE TOWARD LOWER COST PHARMACEUTICALS. SO IT'S- IT'S AN E. DIFFERENT COUNTRIES EVEN ROUGHLY THINKING ABOUT LAST NIGHT THAT I HAD OF YOU KNOW THEY'RE BASICALLY THREE PLACES TO INTERVENE RIGHT YOU KNOW THE WAY PAY PROVIDERS THE WAY CONSUMERS CHOOSE PLANS AND COST SHARING ANOTHER- INTERVENTIONS TARGETED AT CONSUMERS. DIFFERENT YOU CAN THINK OF DIFFERENT COUNTRIES CHOOSING DIFFERENT BASKETS OF THOSE THINGS RIGHT SOVIET LOW COST. GOT TO DO SOMETHING ELSE. GRAY AND I THINK I THINK YOU OF THEIR YOU WE THE THIRD QUEST WAS REALLY WHERE IDEALLY SHOULD THAT BE BUT I THINK. IT THAT THAT'S REALLY KIND OF A MOOT POINT BECAUSE THE SYSTEMS ARE ARE ARE DIFFERENT AND- IN COUNTRIES LIKE YOU SAID THAT HAVE LOWER. LOWER COST FOR CARE THE OUT OF POCKET IS LOWER BECAUSE THERE OF OTHER CENTRALIZED CONTROL SO- SO I KNOW MISTER NAZARIAN SAID HE HE HE WOULD LIKE TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOU- AT A LATER DATE ON THIS AND SO WE'LL FIND A WAY TO CONNECT THE TWO OF YOU. MISTER NAZARIAN JUST SO YOU KNOW IS THE CHAIR FOR AGING A LONG TERM CARE. COMMITTEE AND SO. THAT YOU KNOW THESE ARE THESE ARE REALLY CRITICAL ISSUES RELATED TO OUR TO OUR AGING POPULATION SO. SO AND WITH THAT I THINK WE'LL GO AHEAD AND- SAY THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH FOR YOUR- PRESENTATION AND REALLY APPRECIATE THE INFORMATION. AND WE WILL MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT PANEL SO THANK YOU SO MUCH APPRECIATED DR UNDER. OUR NEXT PANEL. IS A IS A BIGGER PANEL. AND OUR FIRST SPEAKER ON THE PANEL IS GOING TO BE DR CHERYL BURKE. HE'S THE CHAIR IN HEALTH CARE PAYMENT POLICY IN PRINCIPLE SENIOR RESEARCHER. FOR THE RAND CORPORATION. DR DAM BERG THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU DOCTOR WOULD AND THE REST THE COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK HERE TODAY. I AM GOING TO SPEND MY TIME. THE RECOVERING TO BROAD SPACES ONE IS TO PROVIDE A REFRESHER ON WHAT ALL PAYER CLAIMS DATABASE THESE ARE- AND TO HELP THE COMMITTEE THINK ABOUT- THE INFORMATION THAT THEY CONTAIN AND THEN- SHOWING YOU SOME EXAMPLES SOME USE CASES. TO LET YOU KNOW HOW THE DATA THAT WILL BE AGGREGATED HERE IN CALIFORNIA CAN BE PUT TO USE TO TRY TO ADDRESS- THE VERY QUESTION THAT WAS AISED EARLIER WHICH IS HOW DO WE SOLVE. THE AFFORDABILITY AND COST PROBLEMS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. SO LET ME START BY JUST. DOING SOME SET UP- IF WE CAN GO TO SLIDE TO. SO JUST SO EVERYBODY'S ON THE SAME PAGE IN TERMS OF ONE AND ALL PAYER CLAIMS DATABASE SAYS SO THIS IS- THE DATABASE THAT AGGREGATES PULLS TOGETHER INFORMATION FROM BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PAYERS OF HEALTH CARE. AND IT PULLS TOGETHER INFORMATION ON MEDICAL PHARMACY AND DENTAL CLAIMS AND THERE'S ALSO INFORMATION ON THE ELIGIBILITY SO WHO'S ELIGIBLE FOR WHAT TYPES OF INSURANCE COVERAGE ON WHAT TYPES OF BENEFITS- AS WELL AS THE PROVIDERS- THAT THEY SEE AN CHARACTERISTICS ABOUT THOSE PROVIDERS. WE MOVED TO THE NEXT SLIDE. SLIDE. THREE SO IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE MAP OF THE UNITED STATES WHAT YOU CAN SEE AND THIS IS A BEEN A MAP THAT'S BEEN IN TRANSITION- RIGHT NOW THERE'S EIGHTEEN STATES THAT HAVE ALL PAYER CLAIMS DATABASE SIS- SIX THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF IMPLEMENTING- INCLUDING CALIFORNIA- AND I WOULD SAY THAT- THERE'S BEEN TREMENDOUS INTEREST AROUND THE COUNTRY AND TRYING TO BUILD THESE DATABASES. FOR VARIETY OF REASONS- WHICH I'LL GET TO AND A COUPLE OF SLIDES SO IF WE MOVE ON TO SLIDE- I THINK IT'S FOR. SO AND YOU CAN KEEP FLIPPING THROUGH TO ALL THE BULLETS SHOW UP SINCE I'M NOT CONTROLLING- THE SLIDES MYSELF. CLAIMS DATABASES HAVE A LOT O ADVANTAGES OVER THE CURRENT DATA SAID THAT- PEOPLE LIKE MY COLLEAGUES WHO SPOKE BEFORE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO LEVERAGE FOR YEARS BOB HAVE BEEN DOING IMPORTANT WORK TO TRY TO DESCRIBE THE HEALTH CARE MARKET PLACE- AND SOME OF ITS SHORT COMINGS- BUT THE REAL ADVANTAGE OF THESE DATASETS ARE THAT- YOU ARE ABLE TO PULL TOGETHER DATA FROM ALL THESE DIFFERENT SOURCES TO DESCRIBE A COMPLETE PICTURE OF WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH CARE MARKET PLACE- MANY STUDIES- THAT HAVE EXISTED TO DATE HAVE LOOKED AT SEGMENTS OF THE MARKET SO MAY LOOK JUST AT THE MEDICAID PORTION OR MEDICARE- AND- I THINK AS WE ALL KNOW THESE DIFFERENT INSURANCE MECHANISMS HAVE DIFFERENT- STRUCTURES. AND SORT OF HOW THE OUTCOMES THAT ARE DELIVERED FROM THOSE PROGRAMS VERY- AND- WE KNOW THAT PROVIDERS BEHAVIOR VARIES BASED ON SORT OF THE STRUCTURE OF A SET OF- INCENTIVES THAT ARE BUILT INTO THE IT'S- INSURANCE- PACKAGES IF YOU WELL AND- SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT ALL PAYER CLAIMS DATABASE IS ALLOW YOU TO DO IS GET A COMPLETE PICTURE FOR SENATE GIVEN PROVIDER OR SET OF PROVIDERS IN THE MARKET PLACE NOT TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND AS SHE- APPLY PRESSURE IN ONE SEGMENT OF THE MARKET PLACE WHAT IS THE LIKELY A FAX- FOR THAT SAME PROVIDER IN ANOTHER PART OF THE MARKETPLACE- THE OTHER THING THAT I THINK- WHEN WE'VE SORT OF SLICED AND DICED- THE HEALTH CARE MARKET BY THESE. SORT OF NARROW DATABASE SIS IS- THE SHORTCOMINGS ARE YOU END UP WITH VERY SMALL SAMPLE SIZES AND- IT'S HARD TO GET WHAT I CALL RELIABLE ESTIMATES ON PROVIDER. PERFORMANCE WHETHER THAT'S QUALITY PER BERMAN. ON THE EXISTING OF DISK AND HEALTH CARE- OR- IN MANY CASES COSTS. OF THE DELIVERY OF THAT CARE- SO PULLING THAT INFORMATION TOGETHER GIVE SHOUP'S OF STRENGTH IN NUMBERS IF YOU WILL- TO TRY TO- MAKE SURE THAT YOUR ESTIMATES ARE STARS SOUND. SO IF WE GO ON TO THE NEXT SLIDE- I THINK EVERYBODY HERE IS FAMILIAR WITH THE FACT THAT WE'VE HAD- TO BILLS PASSED- IN THIS PAST YEAR- AND THEY- ARE REALLY PUSHING CALIFORNIA TO THE FOREFRONT OF BUILDING THE LARGEST ALL PAYER CLAIMS DATABASE- IN THE COUNTRY- WHICH IS REALLY EXCITING- THE AND I KNOW NOT ONLY THE RESEARCHERS HERE- IN CALIFORNIA BUT- NATIONALLY ARE LOOKING FORWARD. TO TRYING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF EXPLORING THESE DATA AND- HELPING TO BUILD EVIDENCE- AROUND- SAVE- DIFFERENT TYPES OF PAYMENT MODELS THAT ARE MARK SUCCESSFUL- AS WELL AS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS IMPLEMENT CERTAIN POLICIES- WHETHER IT'S AROUND COST CONTAINMENT OR IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF CARE. WHETHER OR NOT THOSE TYPES OF INTERVENTIONS ARE EFFECTIVE. SO ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHTEEN TEN- ALLOWED ALL SHE COULD TO CONVENE A REVIEW COMMITTEE A FULL DISCLOSURE I WAS ON THAT COMMITTEE- AND THIS WAS A MULTI STATE GOVERNMENT STAKEHOLDER GROUP THAT CAME TOGETHER. TO HELP ADVISE OFSHE COULD AT THE VERY EARLY STAGES AROUND THE ESTABLISHMENT- IMPLEMENTATION AND ADMINISTRATION OF THIS DATABASE. I SUBSEQUENTLY- A. B. EIGHTY- NOW IT HAS PROVIDED OFSHE FITTED WITH THE AUTHORITY TO ESTABLISH THE HEALTH CARE PAYMENT DATABASE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND I WHAT I WANT TO LEAVE THE COMMITTEE WITH IS THIS A P. C. D. IT'S GOING TO BE A VITAL RESOURCE TO SUPPORT THE EFFORTS OF CALIFORNIA TO TRY TO IMPROVE THE AFFORDABILITY ISSUE- THAT SOME OF THE PREVIOUS SPEAKERS HAVE. SPOKEN TO. AND IF WE MOVE TO THE NEXT SLIDE SO THIS IS REALLY WHERE THE RUBBER MEETS THE ROAD ABOUT WHY ARE WE MAKING THIS HUGE INVESTMENTS- IN DATA SYSTEMS- AND PULLING ALL THIS INFORMATION TOGETHER BECAUSE WE KNOW THIS IS NOT- SORT OF A FREE ENDEAVOR- BUT WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT- IT CAN HELP SPOTLIGHT OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVING. OUR HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM AND I THINK WE'VE ALREADY SEEN EVIDENCE OF THIS BASED ON SOME WORK THAT'S BEEN GOING ON IN THE STATE OF THROUGH THE INTEGRATED HEALTHCARE ASSOCIATION WHICH HAS COMPILED A MULTI STE- PAYER DATABASE- AND HAS BEEN USING THOSE DATA TO- ADDRESS MANY OF THE ITEMS THAT ARE SHOWN ON THE SLIDE- AND SO THE A. P. C. D. IS GOING TO TAKE THAT. EVEN FURTHER- SO WE WILL BE ABLE TO NOT ONLY UNDERSTAND TRENDS AND SPENDING SOME OF WHICH- KATE HAD SHOWN- AND THAT PASSED PRESENTATION- BUT WILL BE ABLE TO LOOK AT. THE EFFECTS OF PROVIDER CONSOLIDATION ED MAYBE BE ABLE TO HAVE- EARLIER WARNING SIGNS WHERE THAT'S HAPPENING AND BE IT WILL TO THINK ABOUT HOW TO MOD DIFFERENT POLICIES TO AFFECT CONSOLIDATION- AND TO UNDERSTAND WHETHER THOSE POLICIES HAVE BEEN EFFECTIVE- SIMILARLY- THERE'S A LOT OF EXPERIMENTATION GOING ON. THE PLACE AROUND ROOF AND THINKING ABOUT WHETHER AS WE MOVE TO A DIFFERENT TYPES OF PAYMENTS SO- TOWARDS MORE CAPITATION- OR HOLDING UP PROVIDERS AT RISK- FOR NOT ONLY COST BUT ALSO QUALITY PERFORMANCE- ARE THOSE EFFECTIVE MECHANISMS FOR TRYING TO DRIVE IMPROVEMENTS IN OUR DELIVERY SYSTEM. SO LET'S GO ON TO THE NEXT SLIDE- SAID- SIDE SEVEN. SO IN ADDITION TO ADDRESSING COST ISSUES- THE HEALTH CARE PAYMENT DATABASE ALSO HAS- AT THE ABILITY TO HELP PROVIDE A LOT OF INSIGHTS INTO OTHER KEY QUESTIONS THAT WE AS CALIFORNIANS ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT- AND THAT INCLUDES DISPARITIES IN HEALTH CARE- AND UNDERSTANDING THE ROLE OF SOCIAL RISK FACTORS- IN- QUALITY PERFORMANCE BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF HEALTH CARE OUTCOMES- WE ALSO ANT TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND ARE CERTAIN PROVIDERS MORE EFFICIENT THAN OTHERS. AND IF SO WHAT CHARACTERIZES THOSE PROVIDERS AND WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM THOSE PROVIDERS THAT CAN BE POTENTIALLY- ADOPTED BY OTHER PROVIDERS IN THE MARKET PLACE- AND IMPORTANTLY- AND- SPEAKING TO- ONE OF THE SLIDES THAT KATE SHOWED YOU ABOUT VALUE IN HEALTH CARE- WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT THE QUALITY OF CARE IS THAT'S BEING DELIVERED IN THE MARKETPLACE- AND WHAT WE ARE GETTING FOR THE MONEY WE ARE SPENDING. SO THESE ARE ALL- THE ARRAY OF THINGS THAT CAN BE CONSIDERED- FOR- LOOKING AT WITH THE ALL PAYER CLAIMS DATA SO LET'S MOVE ON TO THE NEXT SECTION WHICH I THINK IS REALLY KIND OF WHERE THE ACTION IS- WHICH IS HOW WILL WE USE THE DATA THIS THIS GREAT RESOURCE THAT'S GOING TO BE IN FRONT OF US. TO THINK ABOUT SOLVING PROBLEMS AND IF YOU GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE I'M GONNA GIVE YOU SOME EXAMPLES FROM WHAT OTHER STATES HAVE BEEN DOING WHAT THEY'RE ALL PAYER CLAIMS DATA. SO FIRST THE STATE OF VIRGINIA USE THEIR DATA TO MEASURE WASTEFUL SPENDING THEY WANTED TO SPOTLIGHT AREAS WHERE LOW VALUE CARE WAS BEING DELIVERED SO THAT THEY COULD BRING ATTENTION TO- PROVIDERS IN THE MARKET PLACE THAT THIS IS AN AREA WHERE WE ARE NOT GETTING A BETTER VALUE FOR THE SPEND- AND WE NEED TO THINK A ABOUT WAY. OF REDUCE. THE USE OF THESE SERVICES SO THAT WE CAN RE DIRECT- DOLLARS WHETHER IT'S TOWARDS OTHER HEALTH CARE AREAS OR OTHER AREAS THAT THE STATE NEEDS TO SPEND MONEY ON SUCH AS PUBLIC EDUCATION. IF YOU GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE. NEW HAMPSHIRE HAS USED ITS ALL PAYER CLAIMS DATA TO CREATE SOMETHING THAT'S CALLED HEALTH COST- THIS IS A COST COMPARISON SHOPPING TOOL AND I PROVIDED- A SINGLE SCREENSHOT THIS IS FOR- A REGULAR COLONOSCOPY AND- WHAT YOU CAN SEE- I KNOW THE SIDES NOT SUPER CLEAR BUT- PROVIDERS DO VERY IN TERMS OF THEIR PRICE FOR OFFERING THESE SERVICES- THE AND THERE'S ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON QUALITY OF CARE PROVIDED AS WELL. BOB AND INDIVIDUALS CAN- ENTER DIFFERENT PROCEDURES THAT THEY'RE GOING TO- UNDERGO IN THIS WEBSITE- LOOK UP AND SEE WHAT PROVIDERS IN THEIR AREA ARE CHARGING BOB FOR THESE DIFFERENT PROCEDURES. THESE TYPES OF TOOLS CAN BE- EXCEEDINGLY HELPFUL- NOT JUST FOR CONSUMER EDUCATION BUT ALSO FOR PAYER- EDUCATION JUST IN TERMS OF THINKING ABOUT HOW THEY MIGHT BE. MORE EFFECTIVE IN NEGOTIATING PRICES WITH PROVIDERS BUT ALSO THEY CAN BUILD BENEFIT PACKAGES THAT TRIED TO ENCOURAGE THE USE OF THESE TOOLS BY CONSUMERS- SUCH AS IN THE CASE OF REFERENCE PRICING- WHERE. A PAIR MIGHT SAY WE ARE GOING TO PAY UP TO- THE MEDIAN PRICE IN YOUR MARKET PLACE AND YOU THE CONSUMER ARE ON THE HOOK FOR ANYTHING THAT EXCEEDS THE MEDIAN PRICE. THAT TYPE OF- TOOL HAS ENCOURAGED PATIENCE I CONSUMERS TO SHOP FOR HEALTH CARE. SO THAT'S AN EXAMPLE FOR HOW THIS INFORMATION COULD BE USED. IF WE GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE SIMILARLY- IN COLORADO- THERE'S AN ORGANIZATION THAT CIVIC THAT- THAT DOES A LOT OF ANALYSIS WITH THE ALL PAYER CLAIMS DATA IN THAT STATE- HERE AGAIN WE'RE LOOKING AT THE DIFFERENCES- IN THE PRICES FOR ULTRASOUND. AND YOU CAN SEE IT AGAIN I'M ONLY SHOWING YOU A HANDFUL OF WHAT SHOWS UP ON THAT PAGE- THERE'S A LOT OF VARIATION IN PRICING- WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THIS PRESENTATION IS THEY SHOW SIDE BY SIDE BOTH PRICE AND QUALITY SO CONSUMERS CAN START TO. GET EDUCATED ABOUT THE VALUE PROPOSITION OF WHAT THEY'RE SPENDING AND THAT THE HIGHEST PRICE. BOB PROVIDER ISN'T ALWAYS THE HIGHEST QUALITY PROVIDER. IF WE MOVE ON TO THE NEXT SLIDE. AND HERE ARE BORROWING SOME INFORMATION FROM- MY COLLEAGUES WHO WILL SPEAK LATER ON IN TODAY'S SESSION- CHRIS WHALEY. SO CHRIS HAS DONE A LOT OF WORK AB AND I ENCOURAGE YOU TO- FOLLOW UP WITH HIM ABOUT THIS. COMPARING THE RELATIVE PRICES THAT ARE PAID. TO HOSPITALS- COMPARED TO MEDICARE PRICES AND WHAT YOU SEE ON THIS SLIDE. WAS THAT UP COMMERCIAL PAYERS ARE PAYING TWO TO TWO AND A HALF TIMES WHAT MEDICARE PAYS FOR THE SAME SETS OF SERVICES- AND THAT THIS IS RAISING A LOT OF QUESTIONS IN THE MARKETPLACE ABOUT WHAT IS THE APPROPRIATE PAYMENT LEVEL THAT WE SHOULD BE PAYING FOR THE SENSE OF SERVICES AND ARE THERE OPPORTUNITIES FOR REDUCING SPEND IN THIS SPACE- BY LOWERING- WHAT WE PAY HOSPITALS- ON THE COMMERCIAL SIDE. I RELATEDLY IF WE GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE THIS ALSO COMES FROM WORK THAT CHRIS WHALEY AND- CHICKEN WHITE- AND BRAND- DID- FOR COLORADO. USING THEIR ALL PAYER CLAIMS DATA. SO THIS IS SORTING BY COUNTY IN THE STATE OF COLORADO- THE RELATIVE PRICES PAID. FOR HOSPITAL SERVICES AND YOU CAN SEE AT THE TOP OF THE SLIDE. I HAD THESE COUNTIES HAVE- COMMERCIAL PAYMENT RATES THAT ARE THREE TIMES- THE MEDICARE PRICES SO AGAIN TRYING TO SPOTLIGHT OPPORTUNITIES FOR SAVINGS- IN DIFFERENT MARKETS AROUND THAT STATE. IF WE GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE- MASSACHUSETTS- HAS BEEN VERY ACTIVE IN LEVERAGING THEIR ALL PAYER CLAIMS DATA. AND THEY HAVE A HOSPITAL- I'M SORRY A HEALTH POLICY COMMISSION- THAT WAS- FORMS THAT I'M SORT OF LATE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE EARLY AT TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN. WHERE THIS GROUP MEETS- TO DISCUSS TRENDS THAT THEY'RE SEEING IN THE DATA- AND TO SET BENCHMARKS FOR WHERE THEY WOULD LIKE SPENDING IN THE STATE TO BE- AND THEY MONITOR PERFORMANCE AGAINST THOSE BENCHMARKS. AND WHAT YOU CAN SEE ON THIS SLIDE IS THAT- AFTER FORMATION OF THIS HEALTH POLICY COMMISSION AND ACTIVE FOCUS ON COST CONTAINMENT IN THAT STATE. MASSACHUSETTS WHILE IT IS MIRRORING NATIONAL TRENDS IT MANAGED TO BRING IT SPENDING BELOW THE NATIONAL TREND AND TO KEEP IT THERE. IF WE GO ON TO THE NEXT SLIDE SLIDE FIFTEEN. THE NEXT FEW SLIDES I'M GOING TO- SHOW YOU A NUMBER OF OTHER WAYS IN WHICH THAT MASSACHUSETTS ISSUES THEIR DATA THAT SO IN THIS NEXT SLIDE- WHAT THIS DOES IS IT TAKES SPENDING YEAR OVER YEAR. AND IT BREAKS IT INTO THE VARIOUS COMPONENTS WHETHER IT'S THE COMMERCIAL PORTION OF THE MARKET PLACE MEDICARE- MASS HEALTH IS THE PUBLIC PORTION AND SO ON. AND WHAT THEY'RE REALLY LOOKING TO DO IS TO TRACK NOT ONLY OVERALL INCREASES IN THE MARKETPLACE BUT TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND HOW THAT BREAKS OUT BY. TYPE OF PAYER. IF WE GO ON TO THE NEXT SLIDE. SO ON SLIDE SIXTEEN WHAT YOU'RE NOW SEEING AS AT THE DATA ARE NOW BROKEN OUT BY TYPE OF SPENDING AREA WHETHER THAT'S INPATIENT HOSPITAL CARE. HOSPITAL OUTPATIENT CARE PHARMACY PHYSICIAN SERVICES AND SO ONAND AGAIN TRACKING WHERE SOME OF THE BIGGEST CHANGES HAVE BANNED AND IN THIS CASE PHARMACY- WAS A BIG- YOU'RE OVER YEAR INCREASE AREA. IF WE GO ON TO THE NEXT SLIDE. SLIDE SEVENTEEN- HERE AS THEY ARE BREAKING OUT COSTS BASED ON- SEGMENTS OF THE MARKET AB IN THIS CASE LARGE GROUP INSURANCE. OF VERSES THE SELF INSURED- SO AS I MENTIONED EARLIER THIS PRESENTATION AT THE HEALTH CARE MARKET PLACE IS VERY FRAGMENTED IN TERMS OF- ALL THESE DIFFERENT PRODUCTS THE WAY THEY'RE STRUCTURED THE TYPES OF INCENTIVES THAT ARE BUILT INTO THEM AND SO ON. AND SO THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO TRY TO BOTH UNDERSTAND THE LARGER PICTURE AND AGGREGATED WAY BUT ALSO TO BREAK IT OUT AND UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING IN EACH OF THESE DIFFERENT SEGMENTS. IF WE GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE. SO I MENTIONED THAT- PAYERS ARE EXPERIMENTING WITH ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MODELS SO ONE OF THESE- TYPES OF MODELS- IS REFERRED TO AS ACCOUNTABLE CARE ORGANIZATIONS WHERE PROVIDERS WHO ENTER INTO THESE CONTRACTS WITH INSURERS ARE ACCOUNTABLE FOR DELIVERING QUALITY CARE BUT ALSO HOLDING SPENDING DOWN. AND WHAT MASSACHUSETTS WAS TRYING TO BETTER UNDERSTAND IS WHAT WAS THE ADOPTION OF THESE DIFFERENT- ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MODELS FIVE MARKET SEGMENT- AND WHAT YOU CAN SEE ON THIS SLIDE IS THAT IN THE COMMERCIAL. SIDE OF THE BUSINESS- IT'S BEEN RELATIVELY STABLE IN TERMS OF THE ADOPTION OF THOSE MODELS AND WHERE IT HAS REALLY TAKEN OFF IS IF YOU LOOK IN THE MIDDLE PART OF THE SLIDE- UNDER MASS- M. CO A CEO. IS THE- PUBLIC- THAT PAYMENT SYSTEM HAS REALLY SHIFTED TO ADOPTING THESE ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MODELS. NEXT SLIDE SO THAT GIVES YOU A SNAPSHOT OF SOME OF THE- USE CASES- THERE ARE MANY MANY MORE- AND I'D BE HAPPY TO TALK TO ANY OF YOU- ABOUT OTHER TYPES OF USE CASES BUT LET ME JUST BEFORE I CLOSE OUT MENTIONED SOME KEY ASPECTS. THAT ARE IMPORTANT FOR CALIFORNIA ALL PAYER CLAIMS DATABASE. SO THE WAY IN WHICH THESE DATABASES ARE TYPICALLY BUILT ARE BASED ON CLAIMS INSURANCE CLAIMS FOR FEE FOR SERVICE TYPE CLAIMS- OR PER DIEM IS FOR HOSPITALS. BUT IN CALIFORNIA WE KNOW THAT WE'VE HAD A VERY STRONG PRESENCE OF CAPITATED MODELS- AND INCREASINGLY WITH THESE ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MODELS OTHER FORMS OF PAYMENTS THAT ARE MOVING FROM INSURERS TO PROVIDERS. AND OUR ALL PAYER CLAIMS DATABASE IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT WE CAPTURED THIS FULL PICTURE OF SPENDING SO WE WANT TO KNOW- WHAT THESE PROVIDERS EARNED IN SHARED SAVINGS WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT THEY EARNED AND PAY FOR PERFORMANCE INCENTIVES- AND WE WANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE RECEIVING IN THE FORM OF CAPITATED PAYMENTS. SAIDTHIS IS A CRITICAL ASPECT OF THE DATABASE AS IT GETS BUILT AND LOOKING TO FIND WAYS TO INCLUDE THESE DATA. IF WE GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE. AS I MENTIONED- THIS IS A BIG PART OF THE CALIFORNIA PICTURE IN TERMS OF THESE ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT MODELS- BUT OTHER STATES HAVE FOUND WAYS TO COLLECT THESE AND WE NEED TO LEARN FROM THEM HOW THEY'VE DONE IT. BUT ALSO I WOULD AGAIN REMIND PEOPLE THAT HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE INTEGRATED HEALTHCARE ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN WORKING TO DO THIS FOR YEARS AND THERE'S MUCH TO LEARN FROM THAT ORGANIZATION TO ENSURE THAT WE CAPTURE THOSE DATA. SO ON TO THE KEY ISSUES FOR THE CALIFORNIA APCD DATA IN ADDITION TO THESE ALTERNATIVE PAYMENTS- IT'S ESSENTIAL THAT WE INCLUDE THE MEDIC CAL DATA- BECAUSE A THIRD OF CALIFORNIANS ARE COVERED UNDER THIS INSURANCE MECHANISM. WE ALSO NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CONTRACT HAITIANS- WITH UNIQUE PATIENT IDENTIFIERS BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THERE'S CHURNING IN THE INSURANCE MARKET AND PATIENTS WILL SHIFT. IN AND OUT OF MEDICAID OR IN AN OFFICE IN AND OUT OF THE ACT CALIFORNIA HEALTH INSURANCE EXCHANGE. SO IT'S A CRITICAL THAT WE FIND WAYS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE UNDERSTAND WHETHER. PATIENTS ARE CONTINUOUSLY COVERED- AND WHAT TYPES OF INSURANCE- THEY'VE HAD OVER TIME. AT THE OTHER- PIECE OF THIS IS HAVING UNIQUE PROVIDER IDENTIFIERS- THAT CAN BE MAPPED TO- PHYSICIAN ORGANIZATIONS AND TO HEALTH SYSTEMS. BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE THAT INDIVIDUAL PROVIDERS TYPICALLY WORK IN LARGER ORGANIZATIONS AND THOSE LARGER ORGANIZATIONS BRING THINGS TO THE TABLE THAT CAN EITHER HELP IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF CARE OR ADD COSTS. AND SO TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE CONNECTEDNESS OF ALL THESE DIFFERENT PLAYERS INTO THESE ORGANIZATIONS WHETHER IT'S MEDICAL GROUPS HOSPITALS OR HEALTH SYSTEMS IS VITALLY IMPORTANT FOR THE STATUS AT I SHOULD ALSO NOTE THAT- WHILE THE STATE HAS RESOURCES TO LEVERAGE. INFORMATION COMING OUT OF THE STATE ASIDE- IT IS GOING TO BE VITALLY IMPORTANT THAT THE DATA BECOME AVAILABLE TO THE RESEARCH COMMUNITY WHO CAN REALLY HELP CALIFORNIA LEVERAGE THE INFORMATION OUT TO ADDRESS THE CRITICAL QUESTIONS THAT ARE BEING ASKED ABOUT. HOW DO WE TRY TO IMPROVE THE AFFORDABILITY OF HEALTH CARE. SO LET ME JUST CLOSE OUT- IF WE GO TO SLIDE TWENTY TWO SO AS I MENTIONED AT THE START- THE HEALTH CARE PAYMENT DATABASE- REVIEW COMMITTEE- TIED TO AB EIGHTEEN TEN. MATT OVER- TWENTY NINETEEN AND INTO EARLY TWENTY TWENTY JUST RIGHT BEFORE THE END OF- ARE THE START OF CODED. THIS GROUP WAS A MULTI STAKEHOLDER GROUPS THAT MADE THIRTY SIX UNANIMOUS RECOMMENDATIONS- IT WAS A HIGHLY FUNCTIONING GROUP WORKING WITH- YOU KNOW REALLY TALENTED PEOPLE OVER IT ALL SHE COULD. TO COME UP WITH THE BASIC STRUCTURE OF THE PLAN FOR MOVING FORWARD. AND THIS INFORMATION WAS- PULL TOGETHER IN A LEGISLATIVE REPORT THAT WAS SUPPLIED TO THE LEGISLATURE IN JULY. OF TWENTY TWENTY. I'M NOW WE MOVE ON TO THE LAST SLIDE. WE ARE NOW IN THE NEXT PHASE- ANDTHERE IS A PROGRAM ADVISORY COMMITTEE AGAIN FULL DISCLOSURE- I AM ON THAT COMMITTEE- THIS IS ONCE AGAIN A MULTI STAKEHOLDER GROUP THAT REPRESENTS CONSUMERS PROVIDERS PURCHASERS INSURERS ORGANIZED LABOR- THE HEALTH CARE SERVICE PLANS THE SELF INSURED PLANS- AS WELL AS THE RESEARCH COMMUNITY. AND THIS GROUP OF PEOPLE ARE REALLY COMMITTED TO MAKING SURE THAT THIS IS THE SIXTH SUCCESSFUL ENDEAVOR AND THAT IT DELIVERS ON THE PROMISE OF PROVIDING INFORMATION THAT CAN HELP BUILD POLICY SOLUTIONS. AND THIS GROUP IS WORKING WITH OFSTED TO ADVISE THEM- IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS PROGRAM BECAUSE AS I THINK YOU CAN APPRECIATE THERE ARE MANY DECISIONS- ALONG THIS PATH TO IMPLEMENTATION- AND HAVING THIS BROAD REPRESENTATION- IT IS IMPORTANT FOR ENSURING THAT. ALL STAKEHOLDER VOICES ARE HEARD- AND CONSIDERED IN THIS PROCESS- AND THAT WE CAN WORK TO BUILD A REALLY STRONG RESOURCES THAT WILL BE USEFUL NOT ONLY TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- BUT ALL OF THE STAKEHOLDERS WHO REALLY KIND OF MAKE THE CALIFORNIA. ENGINE WORK. SO WITH THAT I WILL CLOSE AND I'M HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU- WE'D LIKE TO GO THROUGH THE ENTIRE PANEL AND COME BACK TO YOU IF THAT'S IF THAT'S OKAY NOW THAT I KNOW YOU'RE- YOUR- MIGHT KEEP YOU AROUND FOR AWHILE BUT- I THINK IT IF IT WILL HELP US TO FRAME OR FRAME OUR THOUGHTS AROUND THAT BUT I WANT TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH- THIS PROJECT NEAR AND DEAR TO MY HEART. IN OFFICE ENGINE WITH DISCLOSURE THERE IS I THINK THAT THE VALUE OF THE DATA IS REALLY REALLY CRITICAL TO US BEING ABLE TO GET TO A POINT WHERE WE CAN REALLY UNDERSTAND HOW WE'RE SPENDING MONEY AND WHAT WE'RE GETTING FOR IT QUITE FRANKLY SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK ON THAT MUCH APPRECIATED IN YOUR FUTURE WORK AS WELL. I HOPE THAT FIRST MEETING WENT WELL LAST WEEK AND- AND- LOOK FORWARD TO THE PROGRESS ON THE SOUTH THANK YOU SO MUCH THINKPROGRESS. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO.

POSSIBLE DEVELOP POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO ENSURE THE PRIVACY SECURITY AND CONFIDENTIALITY OF CONSUMERS INDIVIDUALLY IDENTIFIABLE HEALTH INFORMATION AS PROTECTED. THAT MY PREPARED REMARKS FOR THE H. P. UPDATE- I'M HAPPY TO MOVE TO THE SUMMARY OVERVIEW OF AUSTIN FACILITY LEVEL DATA REPORTING THAT BE GREAT THANK YOU PLEASE GO AHEAD. RIGHT I AM PLEASED THAT ENHANCE A SLIGHT SLIGHT THREE THANK YOU SO MUCH- AS DEMONSTRATED IN. THE PRESENTATIONS TODAY OFTEN HAS A LONG HISTORY OF SERVING AS A CENTRAL CLEARINGHOUSE FOR HEALTHCARE DATA COLLECTION TRANSPARENCY AND PUBLIC REPORTING. ARTICLE IT'S HEALTHCARE DATA FROM THOUSANDS OF HEALTHCARE FACILITIES LICENSED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. AND OFTEN MAKES DATA AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC RESEARCHERS POLICY MAKERS THE MEDIA. ANDOTHERS. IT ALSO PRODUCES ANALYSES AND REPORTS ON HEALTHCARE OUTCOMES QUALITY COSTS AND OTHER RELATED HEALTH TOPICS. WE HAVE SEVERAL DIFFERENT FACILITY LEVEL DATA REPORTING PROGRAMS. THE PATIENT UTILIZATION DATA REPORTING PROGRAM INCLUDES INPATIENT DISCHARGES. EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT VISITS ENABLE TOWARDS SURGERY VISITS. ALL CALIFORNIA LICENSE HOSPITALS EXCLUDING STATE HOSPITALS ARE QUITE AFFORD THESE DATA ALONG WITH THE TABLE TOWARDS SURGERY CENTERS. THE IN PATIENT DATA CALLED BEGAN IN NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE AND THE REPORTING OF EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT ENABLE TOWARDS SURGERY DATA BEGAN IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE. ON A SEMI ANNUAL BASIS FOR INPATIENT DISCHARGES AND QUARTERLY FOR THE OTHER PROGRAMS FACILITY SUBMIT ABSTRACTED ADMINISTRATIVE DATA FROM INDIVIDUAL PATIENT RECORDS WHICH INCLUDE DATA ON A PATIENT'S ZIP CODE. RICINUS CITY SEX BIRTH DATE PREFERRED LANGUAGE DIAGNOSES TREATMENTS AND PROCEDURES. AS WELL AS THE TOTAL CHARGES EXPECTED SOURCE OF PAYMENT. IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN CLICK TO THREE POINT EIGHT MILLION INPATIENT DISCHARGES FORM FROM FOUR HUNDRED FORTY FIVE HOSPITALS. TWELVE POINT EIGHT MILLION EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT VISITS. FROM THREE HUNDRED FIFTEEN HOSPITALS WITH EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS AND TWO POINT ONE MILLION AMATORY SURGERY VISITS FROM THREE HUNDRED FIFTY. HOSPITALS A DIFFICULT TO APPROXIMATELY NINETY FOUR THOUSAND AMATORY SURGERY VISITS FROM FREESTANDING AMATORY SURGERY CENTER. TO PROTECT THE INDIVIDUAL PATIENT CONFIDENTIALITY ANY REPORTING A RECORD LEVEL DATA IS AGGREGATED AND DE IDENTIFIED. RECORD LEVEL DATA IS ALSO AVAILABLE FOR QUALIFIED ENTITIES SUCH AS CALIFORNIA LICENSE HOSPITALS AND LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. AND QUALIFIED RESEARCH ENTITIES. THESE DATA ARE USED TO UNDERSTAND HEALTHCARE VOLUME UTILIZATION AND OUTCOMES ACROSS CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA HOSPITALS AND OTHERS USE THESE DATA TO BETTER UNDERSTAND POSSIBLE MARKET SHARE THE CASE MIX WITHIN THE HOSPITAL MARKET AND SURROUNDING MARKETS. AND SERVICE BY MINERALIZATION BY EXPECTED SOURCE OF PAYMENT SENT TO NEIGHBORING FACILITIES. IT ALSO PRODUCES ONLINE VISUALISATIONS AND REPORTS THAT DISPLAY THIS INFORMATION TO THE PUBLIC. THE AWKWARD COLLECTS IMAGERY SURGERY VISITS FOR AMBULATORY SURGERY ENCOUNTERS IN THE HOSPITAL SETTING MANY FREESTANDING AMATORY SURGERY CENTERS OPERATE UNDER POSITIONS MEDICAL LICENSE BROTHER HOSPITALIZED SINCE THERE FOR THOSE SURGERY CENTERS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO REPORT IT TO US BUT- TWO OTHER PATIENT LEVEL DATA REPORTING PROGRAMS ARE THE CORONARY. ARTERY BYPASS GRAFT SURGERY OR CABBAGE AND ELECTIVE PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTION OR PCI PROGRAMS. BOTH PROGRAMS BY ANNUAL PERFORMANCE REPORTS OF THE HOSPITAL AND A CERTAIN LEVEL BI ANNUALLY FOR CASH. THE MOST RECENT CABINET REPORTS INCLUDED RATINGS FOR ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR HOSPITALS AND TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE SERVICE. MOST RECENT ELECTIVE PCI REPORT INCLUDED RATINGS FOR ELEVEN HOSPITALS CERTIFIED BY THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH TO PERFORM THE PROCEDURE WITHOUT ON SITE FOR TO GO BACK. AND ADD CITY PH CONTINUES TO CERTIFY NEW HOSPITALS REPORTS WILL REFLECT THIS GROWTH. THE PRIMARY COMPONENTS MEASURES ON WHICH OFTEN REPORTS OUR MENTALITY STROKE. AND EMERGENCY CABBAGE FOR THE ELECTIVE PCI PROGRAM. ADDITIONALLY THESE DATA ARE USED TO UNDERSTAND TRENDS IN UTILIZATION INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF NEWLY EMERGENT CARDIAC PROCEDURES SUCH AS TAVR. AND ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN PROCEDURAL. AND PATIENT OUTCOMES. XIN OUTCOME BY EXPECTED PAYER TYPE AND- IN OUTCOMES BY THE TOTAL OF CARE. OR CAPTURED. THE PLACE THE ADVANCED LIFE. THANK YOU. BUT ALSO BECAUSE FINE AND YOU DATA FROM HEALTHCARE FACILITIES ALL LICENSE COPY HOSPITAL AND LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES ARE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORTS ALSO IT'LL ALSO SUBMIT QUARTERLY FINANCIAL REPORTS THE ANNUAL PORTS ARE MORE DETAILED AND REQUIRED REPORTED WITHIN SEVEN MONTHS FOLLOWING THE CONCLUSION OF FACILITIES FISCAL YEAR. ADDITIONALLY THOSE FACILITIES MUST ALSO SUBMIT AN ANNUAL UTILIZATION REPORT OFFICE. EVERY FEBRUARY FIFTEENTH FOR THE PRIOR CALENDAR YEARS DATA. FOR TWENTY NINETEEN AUSTIN COLLECTED OVER EIGHTEEN HUNDRED DETAILED FINANCIAL REPORTS NOT COLLECTING THESE REPORTS FROM HOSPITAL SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE. EXAMPLES OF INFORMATION COLLECTED INCLUDE TYPE OF OWNERSHIP MEDICAL STAFF SPECIALTIES HOSPITAL SERVICES NUMBER OF BIDS UTILIZATION DATA BY PAYER BALANCE SHEETS AND STATEMENTS OF CHANGES IN EQUITY INCOME STATEMENTS STATEMENTS OF CAPELO REVENUES BY PAYER AND COST ALLOCATION CALCULATIONS. THE DATA ARE USED BY A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT GROUPS. TO UNDERSTAND SAUDI PAYER MIX. UTILIZATION BY PATIENT DAYS. REVENUE CHARITY CARE AND OTHER FINANCIAL MARGINS FOR THE PURPOSES OF HEALTHCARE ADMINISTRATION AND POLICY MAKING ADDITIONALLY THE LONG TERM CARE IN A REPORT ALSO SERVES AS THE MEDICARE COST REPORT AND THAT DATA SHARED WITH UPS TO ESTABLISH FACILITY SPECIFIC MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT RATES. ALL OF THIS INFORMATION IS PUBLICLY AVAILABLE AND HELPS HEALTHCARE ADMINISTRATORS AND POLICYMAKERS UNDERSTAND HOSPITAL AND LONG TERM CARE MARKET IN CALIFORNIA. THE PANTS TO SLIDE. FIVE CAN FINALLY ACOSTA COLLECTS HOSPITAL CHARGE MASTERS FAIR PRICING POLICIES AND COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLANS EACH HOSPITAL IS ANY OF THE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT A COPY OF ITS CHARGEMASTER A LIST OF AVERAGE CHARGES FOR TWENTY FIVE COMMON OUTPATIENT PROCEDURES AND THE ESTIMATED PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN GROSS REVENUE DUE TO PRICE CHANGES. THE HOSPITAL CHARGE MASTERS OR THE LIST PRICE FOR HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND SUPPLIES. SOME HEALTHCARE SERVICE ENTITIES USE THE CHARGEMASTER AS A BASELINE FOR SETTING REIMBURSEMENT RATES AND ALLOWED AMOUNTS. OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES SUCH AS CONSUMER ADVOCATES AND HEALTH CARE PURCHASERS USE THE CHARGEMASTER TO UNDERSTAND VARIATION IN CHARGES BY FACILITY. AUSTIN ALSO COLLECTS FAIR PRICING POLICIES FROM HOSPITALS. HOSPITALS RECORDED LIKE EACH HOSPITAL FROM THE HOSPITAL CHECK A COPY OF ITS CHARITY CARE POLICY. DISCOUNT PAYMENT POLICY. ELIGIBILITY PROCEDURES FOR THOSE POLICIES THE REVIEW PROCESS AND THE APPLICATION FORM THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROGRAM IS TO MAKE THIS INFORMATION AVAILABLE FOR PUBLIC TRANSPARENCY. AND FINALLY THE HOSPITAL COMMUNITY COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLANS ARE ANOTHER REPORT REQUIRED TO BE SUBMITTED TO IT. EACH NON WORLD PRIVATE NONPROFIT HOSPITALS REQUIRED TO CONDUCT COMMUNITY NEEDS ASSESSMENT EVERY THREE YEARS AND TO ANNUALLY SUBMIT IT'S COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN TO OFFICE. REPORTS INCLUDE WAYS HOSPITALS ARE ADDRESSING PRIORITY HEALTH NEEDS IN COLLABORATION WITH THE COMMUNITY. IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWO HUNDRED TWENTY HOSPITAL SUBMITTED PLANS TO WATCH BUT- PREVIOUSLY THERE WAS NO STANDARDIZED CALCULATION OF THE ECONOMIC VALUE OR STANDARDIZED REPORTING A DEFINED CATEGORIES OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS. THIS RESULTED IN DIFFICULTY COMPARING WHAT DIFFERENT HOSPITAL SPEND OR SUMMARIZING WHAT IT'S BEEN OVERALL FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS. INTO THE. FOUR AUTHORED BY CHAIRMAN WOULD WHICH REQUIRES PRODUCT NON NONPROFIT ACUTE CARE HOSPITALS FOLLOW SPECIFIED METHODOLOGY VALUING CARE IF TO THEIR COMMUNITIES. OVER THAT AMOUNT TO BE. WITH CHAIRED COSTS AS FOR A DOCTOR. THE FIRST COMMUNITIES BENEFIT REPORTS WITH AB TWO CORK ARE BEING COLLECTED NOW I ALSO. FOLLOWING EACH HOSPITALS TO TWENTY YEAR END. ALL TWENTY BETTER REPORTS WILL BE MADE PUBLIC. IN. TWENTY TWENTY. SUMMARY OF THE OFF CLOSED. DATA HEALTHCARE PAYMENTS DATA WILL FILL GAPS THE CARE CONTINUUM. WITH MORE DETAIL DATE. INCLUDING THE ACTUAL. REMARKS THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MUCH APPRECIATED AND- LOOK FORWARD TO THE INFORMATION AS IT COMES FORWARD IN THE PROGRESS AND CONTINUED PROGRESS ON THE ON THE DATABASE SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATED GONNA MOVE ONTO OUR NEXT PANELIST- MARRYING A WATANABE- THE ACTING DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTH CARE AND I BELIEVE SHE'S GOING TO BE JOINING US BY PHONE SO. MARY IF YOU'RE OUT THERE PLEASE. GO AHEAD. GOOD AFTERNOON CAN YOU HEAR ME OK YES. GREAT OKAY- SO I AGAIN I'M VERY WATCH LOBBY ON THE ACTING DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTH CARE I AM JOINED BY IT'S PRETTY GOOD THAT OUR DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF OUR IOP WITH THE FINANCIAL RUBIO. BOB DID YOU MAKE THE MISSION IS TO PROTECT CONSUMERS HEALTH CARE RIGHT SINCE YOU'RE A STABLE HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM FOR THE STATE AGENCY RESPONSIBLE FOR LICENSING AND REGULATING A HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE HEALTH CARE SERVICE PLANS THAT PROVIDE HEALTH COVERAGE TO MORE THAN. TWENTY SIX MILLION CONSUMERS IN CALIFORNIA. WE REGULATE MORE THAN 96% OF THE COMMERCIAL AND GOVERNMENT HEALTH PLAN ENROLLMENT IN THE STATE. WERE INVITED HERE TODAY TO PROVIDE INFORMATION REGARDING OUR REPEAL HEALTH PLAN PREMIUM- AND- ALSO TALKED BRIEFLY ABOUT THE IMPACT OF PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS IN HEALTH CARE PREMIUMS. I'LL START WITH THE GENERAL OUTLINE OF THE THREE MAJOR CATEGORIES OF GREAT INFORMATION THAT WE COLLECT. THE FIRST IS A GREAT PILING FOR HEALTH PLANS SUBMIT THE RATES THEY INTEND TO CHARGE FOR THEIR SPECIFIC PRODUCT. FOR HEALTH PLAN PRODUCTS OFFERED IN THE INDIVIDUAL AND SMALL GROUP MARKETS WE RECEIVE RATE FILINGS AT LEAST A HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS PRIOR TO THE HELP ON IMPLEMENTING A GREAT CHANGE. THESE FILINGS INCLUDE THE FINANCIAL DATA THE PLAN TO USE TO DETERMINE JUST BY THEIR PROPOSED STRAIGHT. ALL OF WHICH IS REVIEWED BY THE DEPARTMENT. BUT A LARGE GROUP MARKET WE COLLECT SPECIFIC RATE FOR EACH OF THE HEALTH PLANS MARCH WERE. BUT RATHER WE COLLECT THE METHODOLOGY FACTORS AND ASSUMPTIONS THE PLANT YOU CAN DEVELOP AT THE RATE. OF ALSO WERE COLLECTED ANNUALLY AND HAD AND ONE HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS BEFORE THE PLANNED EMPLOYMENT CHANGE. THE SECOND CATEGORY IS AGGREGATED DATA WHAT IS DATA THAT IS AVERAGED ACROSS PRODUCT OR GROUP. HEALTH PLANS OFFERING PRODUCTS IN A LARGE GROUP MARKET ARE. ALSO REQUIRED TO SUBMIT THEIR AGGREGATE RATE INFORMATION AND LIKE TO THE DELIGHT. THE STARTING OCTOBER FOR OF TWO TWO ONE HEALTH PLAN OF THE IN. AND SMALL MARK FOR ALL BE REQUIRED TO LET YOU KNOW I COULD GET RID OF. TO DEPARTMENT. AND ALLOW CATEGORY OF PRE RELATED DATA WEEK. PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS ENOUGH COMMERCIAL HEALTH PLANS. WHICH IS RECORDED ANNUALLY AS REQUIRED BY SB SEVENTEEN WHICH WOULD ACT ENACTED IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN. NOW WILL PROVIDE MORE DETAIL- REVIEW OF EACH OF THESE CATEGORIES STARTING WITH OUR RATE REVIEW PROGRAM. WHAT DO YOU MAKE A GREAT REVIEW PROGRAM IS AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF OUR OVERSIGHT OF HEALTH PLAN FINANCES THIS OVERSIGHT NOT ONLY ENSURES THAT HEALTH PLAN BURKE FINANCIALLY SOLVENT BUT ALSO MONITORS HOW THEIR EXPENSES RELATE TO THE AMOUNT THEY CHARGE CONSUMERS A PREMIUM. AND THOUSAND AND TEN THE AFFORD CARE ACT REQUIRED STATES TO ESTABLISH A PROCESS FOR THE REVIEW OF HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS TO PROTECT CONSUMERS. FROM UNREASONABLE RATE INCREASES. IN RESPONSE TO THE ACA RATE REVIEW PROGRAM CALIFORNIA PASSED SENATE BILL S. B. ELEVEN SIXTY THREE. WHICH REQUIRES HEALTH PLANS TO SUBMIT PREMIUM RATE INFORMATION AND REQUIRES THE DMH BE TO REVIEW THESE BREAK BY LEADS AND DETERMINE IF ANY PROPOSED RATE INCREASE THAT ARE FOUND TO BE ANGRY. ALL HELLO PLAN TO REQUIRE TO FOR THE THEIR RATE CHANGE WITH THE MAKES THE A HUNDRED DAYS PRIOR TO IMPLEMENTING A RATE CHANGE WITH INDIVIDUAL MARKET. PRODUCT THE DEPARTMENT REVIEWS PROPOSED PREMIUM RATE CHANGES AND THE SUPPORTING DATA INCLUDING UNDERLYING MEDICAL COST TRENDS. AND THE INFORMATION USED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE RATES TO DETERMINE IF PROPOSED RATE CHANGES ARE UNREASONABLE OR OBJECTIFIED. YEAH THE HEALTH PLAN PROVIDES DATA AND INFORMATION SUPPORTING THE RATE OF FILING A CLOSE TO COMPLETE. IT THE RATE IS NOT SUPPORTED ON HEALTH PLAN REFUSES TO ADJUST REACHED THE DM MAKES THE FIND THE FILING AND REASONABLE. IN THAT SITUATION THE HEALTH PLAN MUST NOTIFY MEMBERS OF THE OTHER REASONABLE. FIGHT DURING THE REGULAR PROCESS THE MAKES QUESTION PLAN AND WHETHER PER. AND NEGOTIATE WITH ON THE- DURING IN ORDER TO AVOID ANDREAS FINE. TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN THE DAMAGE PREMIUM RATE REVIEW BOB PROGRAM HAS CONNECTED TO AND SIX MILLION. AT THE END OF IT MARKET MARKET. NOW MOVING ON TO A AVERAGE RATE READ INTO THAT WE RECEIVE. UNDER IN THE INTERNET AND SMALL GROUP RATE REVIEW PROGRAM DO YOU MAKE SHE DOES NOT REVIEW EVERY SPECIFIC CONTRACT HOLDER RIGHT THE LARGE GROUP MARKET. SB FIVE FORTY SIX WHICH WAS ACTED TWENTY FIFTY FIFTEEN INITIATED LARGE GROUP AGGREGATE REPORTING. BUT DO YOU MAKE THE BEGAN COLLECTING LOT OF VARIETY OF AGGREGATED DATA A LARGE GROUP PREMIUMS IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. AND PRESENTED THE DATA AT ITS FIRST PUBLIC MEETING ON MARCH GROUP AGGREGATE RATE TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN. WE HAD OUR FOURTH MEETING EARLIER THIS YEAR PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC STRUCK. THE PUBLIC MEETINGS ARE ACCOMPANIED BY A REPORT SHOWING THE LARGE GROUP RATE DATA BROKEN DOWN THE ROAD FOR IDEA OF WAYS THAT SHOWING EUROPE FOR YOUR TRIP. AMONG THE DATA GROUP REPORTER PLANTS THE GREAT INFORMATION BRING IN FIVE BY VARIOUS INVOLVEMENT GROUP MEDICAL EXPENSIVE. EXPENSIVE AND IT'S MINISTRY TO COST AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE PREMIUM. AND DATA BY DIFFERENT BREEDING METHODS USED TO MARCH FOR COVERAGE. OBSERVATIONS FROM THE STATE OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS INCLUDES THAT THERE IS FAR LESS VARIATION IN RATE CHANGES ACROSS THE LARGE GROUP MARKET. THAN IN THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET. OVER 90% OF THE LARGE GROUP IN RALEIGH THIRTY COVERAGE WITH AN ACTUARIAL VALUE OF 80% OR HIGHER. WHICH MEANS THAT ON AVERAGE THE HEALTH PLAN COVERS. PUBLIC MEETINGS HAVE ALSO SERVED THE USE FOR A FOR PA COMMENT CAN. AB GROUP OTHER. FOR THE DAY AND DO YOU HAVE BEEN TO RECEIVE BACK IN. FROM AND I'LL BE OF THE IT'S A GROUP. SLASH YEAR THE LEGISLATURE AB SEVENTY ONE NUMBER. THE HELP OPERATE CONTRACT CALLED IN A LARGE GROUP MARK TO FILE SPECIFIED BREAK INTO. BUT DO YOU MAKE BEGAN YELLING. AT AT LEAST A HUNDRED DAYS BEFORE IT. A RATE CHANGE. THE DMA IT WILL DETERMINE WHETHER THE METHOD. FACTORS IN SOME. USED DEVELOP A NEW THREE ARE. OR NOT JUST A- IN THE GROUP MARKET GROUP WORKS THE HELP FOR TO BUY GREAT AND IN TWENTY NINE THERE ARE THIRTY DOLLARS SIX RENO BURKE. CALGARY OVERSTEP AND A HALF MILLION AND- SO IT INDIVIDUAL. A REVIEW OF THE RATE FOR EACH CONTRA WOULD BE IN. REVIEWING THE METHODOLOGY FACTOR IN AT SOME YOU BY THESE THE BILL IN THE RIGHT OF THE BENEFIT TO ALL LARGE COUNTRY HOLDERS BECAUSE THAT WE GIVE THEM PREVIOUS UNAVAILABLE. THAT THE MATH OF THE PLAN FOR YOU THEN THE RATES ARE REASONABLE. ADDITIONALLY JULY FIRST OF NEXT YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE A LARGE GROUP CONTRACT HOLDER THAT HAS EXPERIENCE RATED A BLENDED COVERAGE AND MEET SPECIFIED CRITERIA CAN APPLY TO THE DM MAKES THE WITHIN SIXTY DAYS OF RECEIVING NOTICE OF A RATE CHANGE. ASKING US TO REVIEW A RATE CHANGE INDETERMINATE THE THREE UNREASONABLE ARE NOT JUSTIFIED. AB SEVEN THIRTY ONE REQUIRES THE DEPARTMENT TO USE REASONABLE EFFORTS TO COMPLETE THE REVIEW WITHIN SIXTY DAYS OF RECEIVING ALL THE INFORMATION REQUIRED TO MAKE A DETERMINATION. IN ADDITION THIS YEAR THE GOVERNOR SIGNED A B. TWENTY ONE EIGHTEEN LITTLE REQUIRED MUCH OF THE SAME AGGREGATE REPORTING FOR HELP PLANT PRODUCTS AND INDIVIDUAL SMALL GROUP MARKET. SO IN FUTURE YEARS THE PUBLIC MEETINGS REPORTS WILL INCLUDE FOR MORE AGGREGATED DATA TRANSFER SMALL INDIVIDUAL MARKET. WE CAN ALL. NOW I'D LIKE TO END UP MY REMARK BUT THAT CAT. WERE THE- OF OUR ROLE IN. ANOTHER BRIEF IN OUR AND- LAW AT SEVENTEEN. SB SEVENTEEN TRYING TO LAW IN TWENTY FIVE. WITH THE GOAL INCREASING TREND. AND PER THE- WITH. ABOUT THE- OF PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS ON HEALTHCARE. SB REQUIRES HEALTH PLANS THAT FALL RATE INFORMATION WITH THE D. IT MAKES THE ANNUAL REPORT WITH THE FEC DATA RELATED TO THE COST OF COVERED PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. THE BILL ALSO REQUIRES THE DAY MAKES YOU TO PREPARE AN ANNUAL REPORT SUMMARIZING THE DATA AND THE IMPACT PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS AND HEALTH CARE PREMIUM. ANNUALLY COMMERCIAL HEALTH HEALTH PLANS MUST REPORT THE TWENTY FIVE MOST FREQUENTLY PRESCRIBED DRUGS. THE TWENTY FIVE MOST COSTLY DRUG BY TOTAL ANNUAL SPENDING. THE TWENTY FIVE DRUGS WITH THE HIGHEST YEAR OVER INCREASE IN TOTAL ANNUAL SPENDING BY CATEGORY IS A GENERIC BRAND OF SPECIALTY DRUGS. AND THEY ALSO HAVE TO REPORT INFORMATION ON THE OVERALL OVERALL IMPACT OF DRUG COSTS AND HEALTH CARE PREMIUMS. TO DATE DATE MIGHT FEEL RELEASED REAP. THAT THE FILM COMING BUT THE MOST RECENT REPORT RELEASED IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR. IN DEVELOPING THE REPORTS THE DAMAGE TO CONSIDER THE TOTAL VOLUME OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS PRESCRIBED IN THE TOTAL COSTS BY HEALTH PLANS FOR THE STRUGGLING BOTH IN AGGREGATE SPENDING MOBILE. AND A PER MEMBER PER MONTH BASIS. ADDITIONALLY THE DEPARTMENT ANALYZES HOW THE TWENTY FIVE MOST FREQUENTLY PRESCRIBED DRUGS ACROSS THE DRUGS AND THOSE WITH THE HIGHEST YEAR OVER YEAR INCREASE IN TOTAL ANNUAL SPENDING. IMPACTED HEALTH PLAN PREMIUM. I WILL JUST HERE TO NOTE THAT THE DATA REPORT DO YOU REPORTS DO NOT INCLUDE COSTS PRESCRIPTION DRUGS ADMINISTERED IN THE HALL FOR A DOCTOR'S OFFICE. OR OTHERWISE PAID FOR THROUGH A CAPITATED ARRANGEMENT AND ONLY INCLUDE COSTS FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS THE FENCE OF RETAIL OR MAIL PHARMACY. HAVING SAID THAT THE INFORMATION WE'VE COLLECTED SO FAR SHOWS THE IMPACT OF PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE PREMIUMS THE SIGNIFICANT. AND A DEAL MAKES HIS MOST RECENT REPORT HEALTH PLANS REPORTED PAID NEARLY NINE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS FOR SIXTY ONE. DOLLARS AND SIXTEEN CENTS PER MEMBER PER MONTH PER PRESCRIPTION DRUGS IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. TO TWELVE POINT 7% OF THE TOTAL HEALTH PLAN PREMIUM AND AN INCREASE OF. FOUR HUNDRED MILLION FOR TWENTY SEVENTEEN. YES THE SENATE REPORT OF A OF DAY THAT DOUBLES HOW COST OF THE TWENTY MOST FREQUENTLY PRESCRIBED DRUGS RELATE TO DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF HEALTH. SPENDING PREMIUM. WE HAVE TWO YEARS OF AVAILABLE DATA IN THE REPORTS ARE BILL THE TIPSTER TRANSPORT PROVE IN FUTURE YEARS. THE SB SEVENTEEN REPORTS ARE ALSO DISCUSSED THE MADE AVAILABLE PART OF OUR ANNUAL PUBLIC MEETING ON MARCH COULD AGGREGATE RATE- ALL NOTE THAT THE DEER MAKES HIS WEBSITE CONTAINS DETAILED DATA ON THE RATE FILING ALONG WITH TOOLS TO THORTON GRAPH FOR VARIOUS STATE APPOINTED NEARLY TRENDS. THERE'S ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PUBLIC COMMENT ON THE GREAT. PILOTS ARE POSTED ON OUR WEBSITE. IT IMPORTANT UNDER OF THAT WILL BE IN THE STATE A- REPORTING OF THE SIGNIFICANT TOOL OUR INFORMATION DOES NOT EXTEND TO OTHER TYPES OF COVERAGE SUCH AS SELF INSURED GROUPS THAT ARE NOT UNDER OUR JURISDICTION. DO YOU NEED. TO MAKE THESE ROLE WITH RESPECT TO PREMIUM RATE THE DATA COLLECTION IS JUST ONE ASPECT OF OUR OVERSIGHT OF HEALTH PLAN FINANCES. WHICH ALSO INCLUDES MODERATE FINANCIAL STABILITY AND THE REGULATION OF MEDICAL ASSURE ABOUT LOSS RATIO OR MLR REQUIREMENTS. YOU GET FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE THE COMMITTEE WITH THIS INFORMATION THAT COULD BUT REMARKS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MUCH APPRECIATED AND A LOT OF GREAT INFORMATION THERE AND- I THINK IT ONCE THE PANEL CONCLUDES WE MAY COME BACK TO YOU WITH SOME QUESTIONS SO. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE INFORMATION- LIKE TO GO WE'RE GOING BACK TO DOCTOR MELNICK NOW I WAS GOING TO TALK TO US ABOUT- COST GROWTH TARGETS. AND WHENEVER YOU'RE READY DOCTOR MELNICK. HI GREETINGS FROM LA SO LET'S SEE ON MY SLIDE DECK- SLIDE NUMBER ONE. IS THAT UP. YOUR IT WAS YOUR TITLE SIDE I GUESS AND ACTUALLY SITE NUMBER TWO PERFECT WE GOT WE'RE ON THE SAME DATE. THEN THAT'S IT OKAY. SO YOU HEALTHCARE SPENDING IS REACHING LEVELS THAT ARE INCREASINGLY UNAFFORDABLE. WE'VE WE'VE BEEN COVERING THAT TOPIC AT. MANY OF THE SPEAKERS TODAY CALIFORNIA COULD LEARN FROM OTHER STATES IN DEVELOPING A COMMISSION TO MONITOR. AND SET SPENDING TARGETS. AND THIS COULD PROVIDE POLICY MAKERS A MECHANISM TO PROVIDE RELIEF TO RISING HEALTH SPENDING HERE IN CALIFORNIA NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. CALIFORNIA'S OVERWHELMINGLY WANT POLICY MAKERS TO ENGAGE ON HEALTHCARE COSTS ISSUES THIS C. H. CF SURVEY FROM EARLY TWENTY TWENTY SHOWS THAT MORE THAN 80% OF THOSE SURVEYED STRONGLY SUPPORT. POLICY MAKERS TO ENGAGE ON HEALTHCARE COSTS ISSUES SO THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT- TO CALIFORNIANS NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. ONE OF THE REASONS SO IMPORTANT THAT HEALTH SPENDING CONTINUES TO RISE THIS SLIDE SHOWS DATA ON HEALTHCARE SPENDING PER CAPITA OVERTIME IN THE U. S. AS YOU CAN SEE THAT LINE JUST GOES UP AND UP AND UP AND UP. VERY RARELY IF EVER ANY RELIEF AND NOW WE'RE WELL WE'RE ABOVE TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER PERSON PER YEAR AND HEALTH CARE SPENDING. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. HEALTHCARE HELP HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS- ALSO CONTINUE TO RISE. WITH WORKERS PAYING MORE TOWARDS THEIR FAMILY PREMIUMS THIS IS A- THIS THIS LINE IS WITH C. PROBABLY BEEN SHOWN EARLIER TODAY. IN TWENTY TWENTY TOTAL PREMIUM REACHED TWENTY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. FOR A FAMILY WITH THE WORKERS SHARE. ABOVE FIFTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR. THAT'S BEFORE ANY OF OUR OUT OF POCKET. PAYMENTS FOR SERVICES THAT WOULD BE USED SO AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THIS SLIDE. HEALTH INSURANCE HAVE BEEN GOING UP THE CONTRIBUTION FROM THE WORKERS GOING UP AND MORE MORE PLANTS ARE DEMANDING. THE INSURED PERSON OR FAMILY TO PAY MORE OUT OF POCKET AGAIN JUST DATA THAT SHOWS. WE'RE INCREASINGLY BECOMING UNAFFORDABLE EVEN IF YOU HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE. NEXT ONE PLEASE. THREE YOU KNOW THIS ONE SHOWS THAT CO SPENDING GROWTH IS NOT SUSTAINABLE IT HEALTHCARE SPENDING IS OUTPACING EARNINGSAND UNDERLYING INFLATION THE TWO TOP LINES REPRESENT HEALTHCARE SPENDING THE TOOTH BUT SLOWER GROWING LINES ARE MORE BASIC ECONOMIC INDICATORS EARNINGS AND UNDERLYING INFLATION SO CLEARLY HEALTH SPENDING IS OUTPACING BOTH AGAIN CONTRIBUTING TO THE- ON SUSTAINABILITY OF THIS TREND. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. THIS IS CAUSING MORE AND MORE CALIFORNIANS EVEN THOSE WITH INSURANCE TO WORRY ABOUT COSTS MORE THAN HALF OF THOSE WITH INSURANCE REPORTED THAT THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT COSTS. EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE INSURANCE. AND OBVIOUSLY THOSE WITHOUT INSURANCE ALMOST A 100% ARE WORRIED ABOUT COSTS IN CALIFORNIA NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. THESE HIGH HEALTH COSTS THAT POSE HEALTH RISKS AS WELL HALF OF THOSE SURVEYED WITH INSURANCE SAID THAT THEY ACTUALLY REDUCE THEIR USE OF CARE DUE TO COST CONCERNS EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE INSURANCE AND HALF OF THAT GROUP. REPORTED NEGATIVE HEALTH EFFECTS NOW WE SEE THAT THESE RISING COSTS ARE GENERATING NOT ONLY A COST PROBLEM AN ECONOMIC PROBLEM POTENTIALLY A PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM BECAUSE THAT HALF OF THOSE REPORTING DELAYING WORK OR MISSING CARE AND HAVING NEGATIVE HEALTH EFFECTS. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. THE CALIFORNIA COMMISSION COULD HELP POLICY MAKERS IN PRO PROVIDE THE PUBLIC WITH THE DATA TO UNDERSTAND THESE ISSUES AND DEVELOP POLICIES TO PROVIDE MANY BENEFITS THE DAVID NEEDED ARE GOING TO BE COMPLEX. AND IT. IT BECAUSE OUR SYSTEM IS SO COMPLEX AND WE'RE GONNA NEED A WHOLE SERIES OF POLICY CHANGES IF WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO FIX THE SYSTEM AND WE SUPPORT COMPETITION. AT NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SEVERAL STATES HAVE DEVELOPED COMMISSIONS ALREADY A C. H. CF STUDY THAT I WORKED ON THE STUDY FOR STATES IN DETAIL THERE'S A REPORT ON THE- THE CHC WEBSITE AT THE STATE'S. ARE WELL DEVELOPED AND VERY IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS I CAN RUN THROUGH A FEW THAT THE DIFFERENCES QUICKLY NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. MARYLAND IS THE OLDEST THE- COMMISSION IN THE COUNTRY BREAK DATES BACK TO THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES. IT'S EVOLVED OVER TIME. ONE IMPORTANT FEATURE OF THE MARYLAND PROGRAM EVEN TODAY IS A FUN TARGETS ONLY HOSPITAL SPENDING. NOW IT COVERS HOSPITAL SPENDING FOR ALL PAYERS INCLUDING MEDICARE BECAUSE IT HAS A SPECIAL WAIVER FROM MEDICARE TO INCLUDED IN THIS PROGRAM. THEY STARTED OUT BY SETTING JUST IMPATIENT RATES PRICES FOR IN PATIENT CARE THEY EXPANDED THAT TO INCLUDE OUTPATIENT SERVICES AT HOSPITALS AND THAT ULTIMATELY NOW HAVE A TOTAL GLOBAL BUDGET SYSTEM FOR HOSPITALS. THIS ALLOWS THEM TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT NOT ONLY PRICES BUT UTILIZATION AND FACTORS THAT AFFECT BOTH OF THOSE THINGS OVER TIME. THERE IS EXPLORING WAYS TO ADD IN PHYSICIAN SPENDING. UNDER THEIR MODEL IN MARYLAND NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. OREGON THE- TARGETS MEDICAID SPENDING AND HEALTH PLAN RATES FOR PUBLIC EMPLOYEES ONLY SO AGAIN HERE'S AN EXAMPLE OF A COMMISSION THAT HAS LIMITED PURVIEW LET'S CALL IT. ALL RIGHT AND SO THEY THEY HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO REGULATE MEDICAID SPENDING AND ALSO THE AUTHORITY TO IMPACT HEALTH PLAN RATES FOR UP. HEALTH PLANS THAT COVER THE PUBLIC EMPLOYEES BECAUSE THOSE TWO POPULATIONS ARE PRETTY BIG IN OREGON COVERS ABOUT 30% OF THE OF THE COMMERCIALLY INSURED- NON MEDICARE POPULATION. INTERESTINGLY AS PART OF THE REGULATIONS THEY'RE ABLE TO ACTUALLY IMPOSE RATE CAPS. UP WITHIN THE HOSPITAL CONTRACTS SETTING PRICE LIMITS OF 2100% OF MEDICARE FOR THOSE PLANS THAT SERVE A PUBLIC EMPLOYEES SO IT'S A COMBINATION OF HEALTH INSURANCE PLUS RATE REGULATION. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. RHODE ISLAND'S INSURANCE PREMIUM REGULATION MODEL IT COVERS THE COMMERCIALLY COMMERCIAL PLANS FOR THE FULLY INSURED POPULATION ONLY DOES NOT COVER A RISA PLANTS THE HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSIONER- REVIEWS IN ADVANCE FOR THE UPCOMING YEAR PROPOSED RATE INCREASES AND BENEFIT PACKAGES AND HAS THE AUTHORITY TO. REQUIREBOTH CHANGES IN IN IN RATES AS WELL AS COMPONENTS OF THE HEALTH BENEFITS SO FOR EXAMPLE- THE HEALTH COMMISSIONER RECENTLY REQUIRED PLANTS TO INCLUDE SMOKING CESSATION AS ONE OF THE BENEFITS THAT WOULD BE COVERED IN THAT HELP PLANTS SO AGAIN IT'S A PREMIUM- HEALTH PLAN REGULATION MODEL. LIMITED JUST TO COMMERCIALLY INSURED FULLY INSURED POPULATION. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. THE MASSACHUSETTS MASSACHUSETTS IS THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE AND WELL DEVELOPED UP BOTH PROGRAM AND DATA AND REPORTING SYSTEM IN THE COUNTRY ALL RIGHT AND THEY'RE ORGANIZED IS BASICALLY TO AGENCIES THE MASSACHUSETTS HEALTH POLICY COMMISSION AND THEN- WHAT'S CALLED CHEER CENTER FOR HEALTH INFORMATION THESE ARE TWO SEPARATE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES THAT WORK TOGETHER THE DATA AGENCIES RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THE DATA COLLECTION PREPARING THE DATA THAT'S THEN ANALYSED. BY THE POLICY COMMISSION THE HEALTH POLICY COMMISSION IS AN INDEPENDENT ALTHOUGH IT'S A GOVERNMENT AGENCY IT'S GOT INDEPENDENT MEMBERS- AND THEY SET SPENDING TARGETS FOR THE ENTIRE POPULATION- TOTAL SPENDING FOR ALL SERVICES FOR THE ENTIRE POPULATION EXCEPT FOR THE UNINSURED. THEY HAVE EXPLICIT BENCHMARKS THEY HAVE EXTENSIVE AUTHORITY TO COLLECT COMPREHENSIVE DATA AS I MENTIONED THEY HAVE THIS INDEPENDENT AUTHORITY PLUS THEY HAVE A VERY FAIRLY ELABORATE A STAKEHOLDER- STRUCTURE THAT INCLUDES STAKEHOLDERS AT VARIOUS ASPECTS. WHICH THEY- KILL ME MAKES THE WHOLE PROCESS MORE EFFICIENT THEY DON'T DEVELOP DATA COLLECTION PLANS THAT ARE INEFFICIENT FOR EXAMPLE BY INCLUDING STAKEHOLDERS THEY'RE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND EARLY ON OKAY THIS FIELD IS JUST WAY TOO EXPENSIVE TO ADD TO OUR DATA COLLECTION. THIS YEAR WE NEED TO PUT THAT OFF TO YOUR TO OUR TWO YEAR THREE THINGS LIKE THAT SO THEY'VE LEARNED ABOUT. HOW TO DO THAT. A OR A AND THE COOK THAT THEY ALSO HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO MONITOR SPENDING. OF WHAT'S CALLED HEALTH CARE ENTITIES WHICH COULD BE MEDICAL GROUPS HOSPITALS INSURANCE PLANS ED IF THE GROWTH RATES ARE IT EXCESS OF THE TARGETS THAT THEY SET EACH YEAR. THEY HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DIG IN. AND DEMAND- REMEDIAL PLANS FROM EACH OF THESE ENTITIES THEY ALSO HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO REVIEW TRANSACTIONS. AND IF THEY THINK THOSE TRANSACTIONS ARE ANTI COMPETITIVE REFER THEM TO THE STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO THIS SITE SUMMARIZES THOSE FOUR STATES SOME OF THE KEY FEATURES AS I MENTIONED THEY VERY IN THEIR SCOPE OF THE TYPES OF- ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS AND THINGS LIKE THAT ALL OF THE STATE'S SET EXPLICIT BENCHMARKS FOR GROWTH IN HEALTHCARE SPENDING AND IT'S TIED IN SOME WAY TO PROJECTED STATE GDP SO THAT'S HOW THEY'RE KIND OF- TIDYING HEALTHCARE SPENDING TO AFFORDABILITY IF OUR ECONOMY GROWS AT A CERTAIN RATE WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO AFFORD TO SPEND MORE ON HEALTHCARE BUT NOT MORE. THAN WERE- INCREASING IN TERMS OF OUR ECONOMIC OUTPUT. ALL RIGHT NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. ABOUT ONE MORE HERE WE GO SO CALIFORNIA MY CONSIDER SOME OF THE IMPORTANT FEATURES IN THESE PROGRAMS THE VALUE OF EXPLICIT BENCHMARKS THE AUTHORITY TO COLLECT COMPREHENSIVE DATA. GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE THAT INCLUDES STAKEHOLDER COLLABORATION AND THEN SOME OF THE ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS THAT ARE PRESENT IN THE STATE'S MIGHT BE HELPFUL IN A CALIFORNIA TYPE MODEL. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. NO MATTER WHICH DIRECTION CALIFORNIA GOES I HIGHLY ENCOURAGE CALIFORNIA TO MOVE QUICKLY. TO ESTABLISH A SOME KIND OF AN OFFICE FOR AFFORDABILITY. AND COST MONITORING RATE MARILYN I THINK IS A REALLY WORTHWHILE MODEL BECAUSE IT'S THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE THEY'VE BEEN DOING IT FOR MANY YEARS THEY'VE KIND OF LEARNED THE HARD WAY WHAT DATA WE CAN GET EASILY WHAT DATASETS RELIABLE THINGS LIKE THAT. THEY'VE OFFERED TO WORK WITH CALIFORNIA'S STAFF AND ANY KIND OF A TASK FORCE THAT YOU BUY FOR. TO GIVE US THEIR THE LESSONS LEARNED AND HOW WE MIGHT FACE IN DATA COLLECTION- SO I THINK IT'S A WORTHWHILE MODEL TO EXPLORE- YOU KNOW AS I SAID BEFORE I RECOMMEND THAT WE MOVE QUICKLY. I THINK CALIFORNIA ESPECIALLY IF WE IF WE GET GOING WITH THE COMMISSION. HAS THE OPPORTUNITY A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY SPENDING IS ACTUALLY GOING DOWN NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME. SINCE I'VE BEEN STUDYING HEALTH CARE. WHICH IS A LONG TIME AND THEN THE QUESTION IS CAN WE LEVERAGE THIS. YEAR UNFORTUNATE PANDEMIC WHICH IS REDUCING SPENDING TO SET A NEW LOWER COST BASE AND THEN MAYBE SAID GETS. THE DON'T ALLOW US TO REBOUND BACK TO WHERE WE WERE. ALL RIGHT SO WE HAVE A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY BUT I DO THINK WE HAVE TO MOVE QUICKLY BUT AGAIN I THINK THE DATA- COULD BE MADE AVAILABLE QUICKLY. OF MARYLAND IN ADDITION TO HAVING AT ALL PAYER CLAIMS DATABASE LIKE THE ONE THAT CALIFORNIA'S GONNA HAVE. ALSO HAS THE AUTHORITY AND HAS DEVELOPED A MUCH MORE EXTENSIVE REPORTING SYSTEM. WHERE THEY DIFFER WHERE THEY REQUIRE AGGREGATE REPORTS FROM ENTITIES WITHIN THE STATE. THAT ARE MUCH MORE FEASIBLE AND ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE ARREST OF CONSTRAINTS SO AGAIN I HIGHLY ENCOURAGE CALIFORNIA. TO TALK TO THE FOLKS THAT MEASURE IN MASSACHUSETTS FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY'VE GOT WHAT THOSE REPORTS LOOK LIKE- THAT WOULD SAVE US SOME TIME TO GET GOING QUICKLY. ALL RIGHT NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. LET'S SEE SO FEEL FINALLY I AS I MENTIONED IMMEDIATE ACTION- BECAUSE COSTS AND PRICES ARE GOING UP AS WE SPEAK. I MENTIONED EARLIER THE IDEA OF BUILDING ON THE RECENT ATTORNEY GENERAL SETTLEMENT AND THE TREMENDOUS RECORD THAT WAS BUILT THAT LAWSUIT STARTED IN TWENTY FOURTEEN. IT SHOWS YOU HOW OFTEN WE CANNOT RELY ON PRIVATE LAWSUITS TO BRING BACK COMPETITION TO THE MARKET WE NEED POLICYMAKERS TO ACT. WE'VE GOT A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF INFORMATION THAT WAS MADE PUBLIC THAT PREVIOUSLY WAS PRIVATE. THAT WE COULD STUDY AND WE COULD SEE FROM THAT SETTLEMENT. ELEMENTS THAT WOULD HELP TO RESTORE COMPETITION TO THE MARKET LIMITING ALL IN NON CONTRACTED WHICH IS ONLY GONNA GET WORSE NOW WITH THE PANDEMIC MORE THE SYSTEM FOR BUYING UP STRUGGLING HOSPITAL STRUGGLING MEDICAL GROUPS. WE'RE GETTING MORE AND MORE CONCENTRATED IT HEY THAT'S GOING TO GIVE THEM MORE POCKET POWER AND IF WE DON'T O SOMETHING TO PROTECT CONSUMERS THEY'RE GONNA COME BACK WITH BIG PRICE INCREASES. IN THE IS SUES THEIR CONTRACTS RUN OUT- SO. OUR RESEARCH THAT JUST THESE TWO POLICY CHANGES COULD LITERALLY SAVE BILLIONS FOR CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS RELATIVELY QUICKLY MAYBE ESTABLISHED A NEW BENCHMARK OF SPENDING. UP AND GET OUR CONSUMER SOME SAVINGS AND A SLOWER GROWTH RATE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH MELNICK. WE ARE WE'RE RUNNING UP AGAINST A LITTLE BIT OF A TIME CRUNCH HERE AND- I YOU KNOW NOT AND WE'VE SOME ARE MEMBERS OF A HAD TO MOVE ON BUT I SO I MAY FOLLOW UP INDIVIDUALLY WITH QUESTIONS- ON SOME OF THESE ISSUES BUT BUT I WANT TO JUST HIGHLIGHT ON- YOU KNOW WHAT WE'VE WHAT WE'VE HEARD HERE WE'VE GOT AN UPDATE ON THE ON THE DATABASE WE'VE GOT WE KNOW THE- THE VALUE OF THE DATABASE WHICH IS. THE FOUNDATION FOR US OF UNDERSTANDING HOW WE'RE SPENDING OUR MONEY HERE WE HEARD ABOUT SOME OF THE DATA WE'VE HEARD HOW THE DEPARTMENT MANAGED HEALTHCARE OPERATES AND WE'RE GETTING SOME EARLIER EARLY DATA ON ON- DRUG PRICE TRANSPARENCY. AND THOSE AND THE WAY I UNDERSTOOD THAT THOSE NUMBERS ARE ACTUALLY COMING IN HIGHER PERCENTAGE THAN WHAT WE'VE HEARD IN THE PAST WITH- THROUGH OTHER OTHER ESTIMATES WHICH MAKES THAT DRUG SPEND TO BE EVEN A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF THE OVERALL HEALTH CARE SPEND. SO THE VALUE OF TARGETS. AND LOOKING TO MARYLAND AS A PARTNER AS A PARTNER AS WE MOVE FORWARD ON SOME OF THESE THINGS LOOKING TO GO GLOBAL BUDGETING AND- WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT WITH YOU LOOKING AT THOSE TARGETS THOSE TARGETS- ARE OBVIOUSLY LOWER THAN WHAT WE'RE SPENDING CURRENTLY IN CALIFORNIA. I MEAN IF WE'RE AT THREE IN THE 3% RANGE. ON THOSE TARGETS WHETHER IT'S MARYLAND OR MASSACHUSETTS. OR I CAN'T REMEMBER THE OTHER STATE THERE BUT- YOU HAD TO GET- RHODE ISLAND AND OREGON THEY'RE ALL IN THE THREE PERCENTAGE RANGE AND WE'RE HIGHER THAN THAT IN CALIFORNIA SO OBVIOUSLY- THEY'RE DOING SOMETHING RIGHT AND WE'RE WE'RE AND WE'RE BEHIND THE ONE QUESTION I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU AND THEN AND THEN I'VE GOT OF SHIFT THE ORDER A LITTLE BIT I'M GONNA HAVE TO APOLOGIZE TO OUR SPEAKERS BUT- IS THE SKY FALLING. WITH WITH THE STAFF THESE. BY WE- YOU KNOW HOW IT DOESN'T IF THESE BEEN GOING ON FOR A WHILE NOW IN THE STATES. AND I THINK THE PUSH BACK WE WOULD POTENTIALLY GET IN CALIFORNIA'S. OH MY GOODNESS WE COULD NEVER DO THAT IN CALIFORNIA. SO IS THE HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM. FUNCTIONAL VIABLE IN THOSE STATES OR ARE THESE TARGETS WE EIGHTEEN- UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES FOR ACCESS OF FOR AND QUALITY OF CARE. THAT'S FOR YOU DOCTOR MELNICK'S. QUESTION I THINK IT AS PART OF OUR RESEARCH FOR THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH CARE FOUNDATION WE DID INTERVIEW LOTS OF FOLKS IN THE STATES. NONE OF THEM REPORTED HEROES DOWN. YEAH TO- SETTING TARGETS AND ACHIEVING THEIR TARGETS SO AT THE END FORGET WE'RE STARTING FROM AN ENORMOUS COST BASE. AND SO AND THE THESE THE TARGETS THEY CENTER NOT DRACONIAN BY ANY MEANS- AND SO. THEY DIDN'T REPORT- YOU KNOW ANY SUBSTANTIAL NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON THE DELIVERY SYSTEM OUTCOMES QUALITY AVAILABILITY ABILITY THOSE KINDS OF THINGS BUT CERTAINLY THOSE ARE THINGS THAT YOU WANT TO BUILD IN AND MONITOR. IN A COMPREHENSIVE DATA SYSTEM FOR THE STATE RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I WANT TO THANK THE ENTIRE PANEL FOR THE DISCUSSION AND I FOR ONE WILL GO BACK AND RE WATCH THIS BECAUSE I WANT TO PICK UP SOME MORE INFORMATION SO. MY APOLOGIES TO THE NEXT TWO SPEAKERS WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE ORDER- AND WE NEED TO ASK THE DOCTOR WHALEY SPEAK- APPARENTLY IN SAN FRANCISCO THEY'RE GOING TO CLOSE THE BUILDING WHERE HE IS AT FIVE O'CLOCK WHICH MEANS THAT IF WE DON'T CHANGE THE ORDER OF OUR PRESENTATIONS. WE WILL GET TO HEAR MISTER WHALEY AND I OUR DOCTOR WEEKLY AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE HEAR THIS- HIS HIS COMMENTS ARE BOTH IMPORTANT AND I SO I APOLOGIZE TO MR GREENY- I HOPE YOU CAN STICK WITH US- AND BECAUSE I KNOW YOUR YOUR PORTION IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO US AS WELL- AND I HOPE THAT YOUR BILL IS NOT GOING TO GET CLOSED BUT WE DO KNOW IN SAN FRANCISCO THEY'RE GOING TO CLOSE THE BUILDING AT FIVE O'CLOCK SO. SO I'D LIKE TO HAVE- DR WHALEY IF YOU ARE AVAILABLE TO- SPEAK TO US- PLEASE. SIR PLEASE JUMP IN. THE DOCTOR THE DOCTOR WAY THESE IN SAN FRANCISCO TO THOSE. AHA. GREAT MOSTLY WE ADJUST THE CAMERA CARE HERE TALLER THAN SORRY THERE WE GO. THANK YOU AND PLEASE PLEASE A PLEASE GO AHEAD DOCTOR WHALEY IS A POLICY RESEARCHER AND PROFESSOR. PARDEE RAND GRADUATE SCHOOL AND HE'S GOING TO BE TALKING TO US ABOUT OPTIONS. FOR CONTROLLING COSTS OF DOCTOR WINNING. GO AHEAD LOOK THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME AND I'M EXCITED TO TALK ABOUT HEALTHCARE AFFORDABILITY IN CALIFORNIA CAN YOU PULL THE MICROPHONE CLOSER TO YOU OR SPEAK UP YOU PULL THE MICROPHONE CLOSER TO YOU OR SPEAK AT. OKAY THE LAST IS THAT YEAH IT'S A LITTLE BIT. HARD TO MASK. AND SO I TRY TO SPEAK UP. IF A GHOST OR SOMETHING MOVING YOUR MICROPHONE UNDER RECORD NEXT. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THAT IS A DRIVING ISSUE OF MANY THINGS AND TALK ABOUT TODAY IS JUST THE GROWING CONCERN FOR HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY FOR MANY CALIFORNIANS IN A RECENT SURVEY CONDUCTED BY THE KAISER FAMILY FOUNDATION OF A CALIFORNIANS CALIFORNIA LISTED HEALTHCARE COSTS IS A GROWING CONCERN HEALTHCARE AFFORDABILITY. WHEN ASKED ABOUT SPECIFIC AREAS OF HEALTHCARE COSTS THEIR CONCERNS. ARE FIT THINGS LIKE MENTAL HEALTH CARE INCREASE ACCESS TO PROVIDERS AND AT LOWER COSTS FOR HEALTHCARE WE'RE SPECIFIC AREAS OF ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY. THAT OUR CONCERNS FOR CALIFORNIANS. THE CLIPPERS. IN LIGHT WITH THE AFFORDABILITY THAT THAT MANY CALIFORNIA- EXPRESSING IT'S IMPORTANT TO THINKABOUT MAYBE THE COST PRESSURES THAT ARE BEING PLACED ON CALIFORNIANS FOR HEALTH CARE THESE ARE NUMBERS THAT ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE THEY WERE PRESENTED BY BY MANY THE PREVIOUS PANELISTS AND SO I THINK THERE'S A GROWING CONSENSUS AMONG RESEARCHERS THAT THE ISSUES AROUND AFFORDABILITY ARE IMPORTANT FOR POLICY MAKERS AND FOR CALIFORNIANS. IN CALIFORNIA THE AVERAGE EMPLOYER PLAN OR THE RIGHT AVERAGE PREMIUM RATHER FOR EMPLOYER SPONSORED PLAN. IS NOW OVER TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS WHICH AN INCREASE OF A DEDUCTIBLES FOR CALIFORNIANS HAVE INCREASED OVER 210060% AND NOW THE TYPICAL DEDUCTIBLE FOR CALIFORNIA FAMILY PLANNING FOR THOSE WITH EMPLOYER SPONSORED INSURANCE IS OVER ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS. LOOKING AT THE CURRENT COVER CALIFORNIA MARKET FOR THOSE WHO RECEIVE INSURANCE THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA EXPERIENCE SINCE CHANGE. AVERAGE PREMIUMS NOW AVERAGE AROUND FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. THANKS I PLEASE. I THINK THIS IS THE SAME CHART WHAT WAS PRESENTED IN THE PROFESSOR BALLOTS PRESENTATION BUT THERE'S ALSO IT IN LIGHT OF THE GROWING COST A CONCERN THAT THAT WE ARE CENTRALLY PAYING FOR HEALTH CARE COSTS AND RISING HEALTH CARE COSTS AND WAGES AND OTHER TYPES OF BENEFITS. JUST AN EXAMPLE OF THIS THIS USES DATA FROM FROM A NATIONWIDE SURVEY OF EMPLOYER PLANS. AND IF WE LOOK AT THE AVERAGE COST GROWTH FOR EMPLOYERS. DEDUCTIBLES HAVE INCREASED BY A 162% OVER THE LAST DECADE AT THE SAME TIME PREMIUMS INCREASE INCREASE BY ABOUT FIFTY PERCENT. WHICH IS MUCH FASTER THAN WAGES AND AT AND IT JUST OVERALL GENERAL PUSH. THE CLIPPERS. TO HELP LOOK AT SOME OF THE ISSUES AROUND HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY. MY COLLEAGUES AT RAND AND I LOOKED AT THAT HOSPITAL PRICES AND HOW THEY VARY ACROSS THE COUNTRY. TO DO SO WE USED A LARGE COLLECTION OF INSURANCE DATA FROM BOTH EMPLOYER PLANS AND ALSO AIR ALL PAYER CLAIMS DATABASE IS. WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT ACROSS THE COUNTRY. EMPLOYERS IN AND PRIVATE INSURANCE PLAN TO PAYING PRICES THERE WERE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND 47% MEDICARE. IN CALIFORNIA THE PRICE WAS A LITTLE BIT HIGHER. THE RELATIVE TO MEDICARE THE AVERAGE PRICE FOR INSURANCE PLANS IN THE STATE WAS ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND BOARD CALIFORNIA. ROGEN'S PLANS AND INDIVIDUALS WITH INSURANCE COVERAGE IN CALIFORNIA ARE PAYING ABOUT TWICE WHAT MEDICARE WOULD PAY FOR HOSPITAL SERVICES. NEXT I PLEASE. WE ALSO LOOK TO BE RANGING HOSPITAL PRICES AND IT'S NOT SO WE FOUND THAT WHILE THE AVERAGE WAS ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND 60% THE PRICE FOR HOSPICE SERVICES RANGE QUITE DRASTICALLY SO WE HAVE SOME HOSPITALS THE LOWER END THAT ARE PRICED AT ABOUT HOSPITALS THAT ARE OVER TWICE AS HIGH AND ABOVE 4100% MEDICARE. AND SO THE STORY OF A HOSPITAL PRICES IN CALIFORNIA IS NOT THAT THERE'S A SINGLE PRICE THAT'S HIGHER LOWER BUT RATHER THAT THERE'S A WIDE RANGE DISTRIBUTION OF PRICES. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. AT THE SAME TIME WHILE PRICES VARY WIDELY QUALITY OF SERVERS AS WELL. AND ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE DID THE STUDY AND HOW ONE OF THE GOALS THAT WE HOPE EMPLOYERS POLICYMAKERS AND OTHERS WILL USE OF THE STATE UP IS ACTUALLY TO COMBINE INDIVIDUAL OVER PRICE DATA WITH WITH HOSPITALS- CHOIR OR QUALITY DATA RATHER. TO LOOK AT THE HIGH QUALITY AND LOW PRICE HOSPITALS WHICH YOU CAN THINK OF IN TERMS OF VALUE PERSPECTIVE REPRESENT THE HIGH VALUE HOSPITALS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO HERE THE THESE HOSPITALS ARE ARE HIGHLIGHTED AT THE BOTTOM CORNER IT BLEW. THE NEEDS OF THE HOSPITALS THAT HAVE BELOW AVERAGE PRICES. AND QUALITY THAT IS ABOVE AVERAGE FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AS YOU CAN SEE THERE THERE ARE MANY WELL KNOWN HOSPITALS- THAT THAT WE'VE HIGHLIGHTED AND SO IT'S THERE THERE ARE HOSPITALS THAT ARE WELL KNOWN BECAUSE THIS TO CALIFORNIA. AND HELP OF LOW PRICES AND HIGH QUALITY. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. AND WHEN WE LOOK A BIT DEEPER THE RANGE OF PRICES THAT THE VARIATION PRICES IN ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS REALLY DRIVEN BY RELEASED WHAT ONE CONTRIBUTING FACTOR THAT WE NOTICE RIGHT AWAY IS THAT IF WE LOOK AT HOSPITAL PRICES THERE MANY HOSPITAL PRICES IN IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA THAT TEND TO BE MORE EXPENSIVE. COMPARED TO HOSPITALS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND SO ACTUALLY IF WE IF WE LOOK AT OUR DATA. AND DISTINGUISHED USING BB AFFORDABLE- THAT THE COVER CALIFORNIA RATING AREAS. AND SPLIT THE OUR OUR SAMPLE IN USING SOME OTHER DATA LOOKING AT IT HOSPITAL RATING REGIONS. AND LOOK AT HOSPITALS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. WE FIND THAT HOSPITALS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. ABOUT THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS MORE EXPENSIVE FOR INPATIENT MISSION. WHERE AVERAGE COST FOR NORTHERN CALIFORNIA INCREASED MISSION IS ABOUT THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS COMPARED ABOUT TWENTY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. IF WE LOOK AT THE SAME PRICE RELATIVE TO MEDICARE FOR A HOSPITAL'S OVERALL. WE FIND THAT NORTHERN CALIFORNIA HOSPITALS ARE ABOUT 23% MORE EXPENSIVE THAN OTHER CALIFORNIA HOSPITALS. AT 210080% MEDICARE- RELATIVE TO ABOUT 210030% MEDICARE. AND THEN IF WE USE OUR ADDITIONALLY A MARKET CONSTRUCTION MEASURES DEVELOPED BY BY FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATORS. TO THINK ABOUT WHAT'S A HEALTH. ARE OUR COMPETITORS. AS MEASURED BY BODY MEASUREMENT CALLED THE HER FOR DAHLE TO TRY WHERE A HIGHER IF YOU TRY TO DO INDICATES A LESS COMPETITIVE AND MORE COST FREE MARKET. IN THE LOWER EIGHTY CHINA INDICATES A- A MORE COMPETITIVE MARKET. WE FIND THAT POTENTIALLY A LT OF THE VARIATION THE REFINED OR DIFFERENCE OF PRICES RATHER GOOD FIGHT BETWEEN NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. IS ACTUALLY EXPLAINED. BY BY DIFFERENCES IN MARKET STRUCTURE. SO NORTH CALIFORNIA WE FIND THAT THE HOSPITAL A TO TRY. THIS JUST UNDER THREE THOUSAND THE FTC AND DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE CONSIDER IT A MARKET THAT IS VERY CONCENTRATED USING OTHER INDUSTRY DEFINITIONS AND OTHER INDUSTRIES AND IN A TO A TYPE OF TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED. AND SO APPLYING THAT SAME MARKET DEFINITION OR MARKET CONSTRUCTION MEASURE TO HOSPITALS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA SUGGESTED THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL MARKET IS NOT COMPETITIVE- USING BEAUTY METRICS THAT HAVE BEEN APPLIED BY BY FEDERAL REGULATORS. IN CONTRAST THE EIGHTY GIANT CALIFORNIA IS ABOUT 60% OF BAD NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AT ABOUT. EIGHTEEN HUNDRED. AND IF WE LOOK AT IT PREMIUMS ON THE ACA. RECOVER CALIFORNIA RATHER OUR PREMIUMS IN IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA FOR A SILVER THE SECOND MOST EXPENSIVE SILVER PLAN. FOR A FIFTY FIVE YEAR OLD. ARE ABOUT CALIFORNIA VERSUS OTHER CALIFORNIA. ABOUT ONE POTENTIAL EXPLANATION IS THAT IT'S JUST CAUGHT MORE COSTLY TO DO BUSINESS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA FOR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. OR POTENTIALLY- WAGES ARE HIRED IN NORTHERN VERSUS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIANS SO THEY COST MORE TO PROVIDE HEALTH CARE BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO PAY DOCTORS AND NURSES MORE. BUT IF WE ACTUALLY LOOK AT JUST TO KIND OF METRICS OF JUST OVERALL MARKET DIFFERENCES OUTSIDE OF HEALTHCARE. WE ACTUALLY FIND IT THROUGH THE STORY MAY NOT BE EXPLAINED BY THOSE TYPES OF DIFFERENCES. SO FOR EXAMPLE IF WE LOOK AT OVERALL WAGES WAGES IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. ARE JUST 4% HIGHER THAN THAN IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND IF WE LOOK AT HOUSING COSTS. WHICH WE MEASURED HERE TO THE AVERAGE HOME VALUE. HOUSING COSTS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA ARE ACTUALLY LESS EXPENSIVE THAN IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA INTO THIS MIGHT BE ONE POTENTIAL BAROMETER OF OUR COST OF LIVING. ANSWERS IS WE'RE WE'RE COMPARING PRICES AND MARKET STRUCTURE ACROSS CALIFORNIA. THERE ARE NOTICEABLE DIFFERENCES IN PRICES. BETWEEN NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THESE PRICES DON'T SEEM TO BE EXPLAINED BY DIFFERENCES IN JUST THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS IN NORTHERN VERSUS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. BUT THE STRUCTURE OF THE HOSPITAL INDUSTRY IN HOSPITAL MARKETS ARE DRASTICALLY DIFFERENT BETWEEN NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. M. IN A RELATED STUDY COLLEAGUES AT THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA BERKELEY AND I HAVE LOOKED AT THAT THE STRUCTURE OF MARKETS ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND HOW THEY'VE EVOLVED OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS. WE DID THIS STUDY IS WE CREATED AN INDEX OF HOSPITAL MARKET CONCENTRATION HERE SCALE GOES FROM ZERO SO THAT THE COMPETITIVE MARKET. WITH WHAT THE COMPETITION. TO OUR HIGHEST MEASURE OF SIX WHICH IS A MANAGER MARKET WITH LITTLE COMPETITION AND LOTS OF VERTIGO CONCENTRATED MARKET. WHAT WE FIND IS THAT OVERALL BETWEEN THE TWO THOUSAND TEN TO TWENTY SIXTEEN PERIOD. MARKETS AND IN CALIFORNIA DID BECOME MORE CONCENTRATED. HOWEVER THE CONCENTRATION OF THE LARGEST GROWTH MARKET CONCENTRATION REALLY OCCURRED IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. IN A PARTICULAR IN IN THE FAR KIND OF REACHES NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND ALSO IN IN THE SIERRA FOOTHILLS. AND SO WHAT WE ARE. HAPPY TALKED ABOUT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PRICES IN OTHER MARKETS STRUCTURE IN NORTHERN VERSUS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THIS CHART ILLUSTRATES WHERE A LOT ABOUT CHANGING MARKET CONCENTRATION IS ACTUALLY OCCURRING. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. ANOTHER RECENT TREND THAT IS ALSO HAPPENING IN CALIFORNIA IS ALSO THE IS THAT THE TREND OF VERTICAL INTEGRATION WHERE PHYSICIANS ARE EMPLOYED BY HOSPITALS OR HEALTH SYSTEMS KATE TOUCHED ON SOME OF THE AFFECTS OF VERTICAL INTEGRATION BUT HERE I JUST WANT TO ILLUSTRATE WHAT'S HAPPENING IN TERMS OF THE RISE IN BROOKLYN GRATION. IN CALIFORNIA. IN THE SAME STUDY THAT THAT HIGHLIGHTED EARLIER. WE DOCUMENTED TRANS IN VERTICAL INTEGRATION OF CALIFORNIA PHYSICIANS USING DATA ON BOTH PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS WHICH IS- INDICATED BLUE HERE. PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS INCREASED FROM ABOUT- 26% OF PHYSICIANS BEING VERTICALLY INTEGRATED TO JUST UNDER 40% IN IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. FOR SPECIALIST POSITIONS INDICATED READ THE GROWTH WAS PRETTY RUDE TO THIS MUCH MORE DRAMATIC INCREASING FROM ABOUT 20% IN SEVEN ADDITION TO CHANGING MARKET STRUCTURE MORE AND MORE PHYSICIANS ARE NOW POISED BY A HOSPITAL OR HEALTH SYSTEM AND THERE ARE FEWER INDEPENDENT PHYSICIANS. A LOT OF- A DOCTOR UNDER FROM COLLEAGUES WORK SUGGESTS THAT THEY'RE BOTH PRICE COMPETITION AND QUALITY EFFECTS OF VERTICAL INTEGRATION INTO THIS TYPE OF TREND IS SOMETHING THAT. THAT REGULATORS IN CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE AWARE OF. EXIDE THE BILL. MOST OF OUR WOULD HAVE TALKED ABOUT TODAY WERE ALL OVER TALK ABOUT THE RATHER HAS FOCUSED ON ON HOSPITAL COSTS BUT I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO KNOWLEDGE THAT PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS ACCOUNT FOR GROWING SHARE OF SPENDING. IF WE LOOK ACROSS THE LAST THREE YEARS PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS ACTUALLY SHOW THAT THE LARGEST INCREASE IN SPENDING AND NOW COUNT FOR ABOUT 21% OF HEALTHCARE COSTS IN CALIFORNIA. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. ADDITIONALLY ANOTHER POLICY CONCERN FOR MANY CALIFORNIA'S OUT OF NETWORK BILLS WERE SURPRISED BILLS. IN A SURVEY CONDUCTED BY THE KAISER FAMILY FOUNDATION ABOUT A THIRD OF CALIFORNIA'S REPORTED THEY HAD RECEIVED AN UNEXPECTED OR A SURPRISE BILL IN THE LAST YEAR. UNEXPECTED AND SURPRISE BILLS- THAT THAT HAPPENED WITH WIND A PATIENT GOES OUT OF NETWORK FOR A SERVICE WHERE THEY THEY ARE NOT ANTICIPATING. RECEIVING OUT OF NETWORK BILLING BELIEVE THAT EVERYTHING IS IN NETWORK. OR BOTH SOMETHING THAT BECAUSE LOTS OF DISTRESS TO PATIENTS WITH IT IN ADDITION OR SOMETHING THAT THEY CAN ALSO LEAD TO HIGHER PRICES FOR IN NETWORK CARE. NEXT I PLEASE. FINALLY WHO WOULD HAVE DISCUSSED SO FAR HAS REALLY FOCUSED ON ON THE POPULATION THAT RECEIVES INSURANCE THIRD EMPLOYER OTHER TYPES OF PRIVATE INSURANCE INCLUDING THROUGH COVERED CALIFORNIA. IT'S IMPORTANT TO ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE MANY PATIENTS WHO WHO RECEIVE CARE OUTSIDE OF THE EMPLOYER SPONSORED OR PRIVATE INSURANCE SYSTEM. IN PARTICULAR THERE THERE ARE ABOUT A HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE FEDERAL QUALIFIED HEALTH CARE CENTERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. TO PROVIDE CARE FOR OVER FOUR MILLION CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE PREDOMINANTLY LOW INCOME. IN ADDITION THERE ARE THIRTY SIX CRITICAL ACCESS HOSPITALS. THAT PROVIDE CARE FOR RURAL CALIFORNIANS. AND CALIFORNIA IS ALSO HOME TO OVER TEN MILLION MEDICAID ENROLLEES AND- ALMOST THREE MILLION PEOPLE WITHOUT INSURANCE. AND THOSE WERE THINKING ABOUT POLICIES TO ADDRESS THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO KNOWLEDGE THAT THE PRICE ISSUES THAT THE MARKET COMPETITION ISSUES THAT HIGHLIGHTED EARLIER. EMILY TARGET TO PRIVATELY INSURED POPULATION AND THEIR OTHER POPULATIONS WHERE WE NEED TO ENSURE WE HAVE ADEQUATE ACCESS TO CARE. NEXT I PLEASE. AND SO THAT THAT'S KIND OF THE LANDSCAPE POLICE AS I SEE THE PRIMARY ISSUES AFFORDABILITY CALIFORNIA. AND AS WE'RE THINKING ABOUT POLICIES TO ADDRESS AFFORDABILITY AND TO ENSURE ACCESS TO AFFORDABILITY I THINK THAT THE LEAST THE WAY I THINK OF IT IS THROUGH THERE IS A CONTINUUM OF POLICY OPTIONS. WITH INCREASING EFFORTS AND INCREASING CHALLENGES TO IMPLEMENTING ITS POLICY BUT THE SAME TIME INCREASING REWARDS. AND SO IT JUST EXAMPLE- CALIFORNIA HAS MADE GREAT STRIDES RECENTLY TO ADOPT PRICE TRANSPARENCY. AD I THINK THIS IS A POLICY OPTION THAT CAN. BE TO FURTHER CHANGES BUT WE HAVE TO BE REALISTIC THAT PRICE TRANSPARENCY BY ITSELF ISN'T SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO WHOLESALE CHANGE THAT THE MARKET CALIFORNIA. GIVEN THE EFFORT THAT THE CALIFORNIA'S INVESTED IN IN PROMOTING PRICE TRANSPARENCY I THINK THERE ARE WAYS TO THINK ABOUT LEVERAGING A LOT OF THAT WORK TO BUILD ON ON ON PRICE TRANSPARENCY FOR FURTHER POLICIES. SO FOR EXAMPLE MANY EMPLOYERS IN CALIFORNIA I AM GONNA HIGHLIGHT SOME SPECIFIC SPECIFIC EXAMPLES ARE REALLY DOING REALLY INNOVATIVE WORK AROUND INSURANCE BENEFIT DESIGN. WHERE THEY'RE USING PRICE TRANSPARENCY INFORMATION TO INFORM HOW THE STRATEGICALLY SET BENEFITS FOR THE WORKERS. AND THEN FINALLY FOR THINKING ABOUT ADDRESSING MARKET COMPETITION AND ADDRESSING PRICES FOR FROM MORE OF A REGULATORY STANDPOINT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT CAN BUILD ON ON ON PRICE TRANSPARENCY. BUT IT MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT REQUIRES MORE EFFORT FOR BRENDA LATERS AND POLICY MAKERS BUT IT MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT COULD HAVE A BROADER IMPACT ON AFFORDABILITY FOR CALIFORNIANS. NEXT I PLEASE. IT TOO IF WE THINK ABOUT WAYS TO ADDRESS PRICE TRANSPARENCY I THINK THE ALL PAYER CLAIMS DATABASE THAT THE MY COLLEAGUE CHERYL DEBRA MENTIONED IS A REALLY GREAT START FOR CALIFORNIA AND AN EXCELLENT WAY TO PROMOTE PRICE TRANSPARENCY. ONE OF THE CHALLENGES OF PRICE TRANSPARENCY NOT JUST IN CALIFORNIA BUT IN IN EVERY OTHER STATE IS THAT THE THROUGH THE RECENT SUPREME COURT DECISION TWENTY FOURTEEN. OF KOBE VERSES OF THE METRIC MUTUAL LIMITS THE ABILITY OF CALVET OR IF OF STATE UP HERE CLAIMS DATABASES. TO COLLECT DATA FROM FROM SELF FUNDED INSURANCE PLANS WHICH PRIMARILY COVER THE LARGE GROUP INSURANCE MARKET THAT'S REGULATED THROUGH ARRESTED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THIS IS A KEY. A SHORTCOMING OF MANY ARE ALL PAYER CLAIMS DATABASE IS. WHAT POTENTIAL OPTIONS WERE THESE POLICY THAT THE CALIFORNIA COULD COULD EXPLORE AND HAS BEEN- DISCUSSED IN OTHER STATES IS TYING A PARTICIPATION OTHER INSURANCE PRODUCTS IN CALIFORNIA TO SUBMISSION TO THE PCT FOR SELF FUNDED PLANS. FOR EXAMPLE. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA COULD THINK ABOUT WAYS TO REQUIRE THAT FIRMS WHO WHO OFFERED INSURANCE THROUGH COVERED CALIFORNIA ALSO SUBMIT THEIR SELF FUNDED DATA TO A CALIFORNIA APCD. OTHER FOR STATE TO HAVE ADOPTED MODELS WERE INSURANCE PLANS TO PROVIDE BENEFITS TO THE STATE PLAY HEALTH PLAN. I HAVE TO PROVIDE INSURANCE FOR THEIR HIRD NON STATE PLAY HEALTH PLAN TO THE STATE APC APCD AS A PARTICIPATION FOR UP FOR ADMINISTERING THE EMPLOYEE HEALTH PLAN DATA. AND THAT'S A POTENTIAL POLICY THAT THE CALIFORNIA COULD CONSIDER AS WELL. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. THIS IS EXAMPLE OF HOW HOW CALIFORNIA PUBLIC PURCHASERS HAVE ABUSED DRUG PRICE TRANSPARENCY I THINK REALLY COME FROM THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC EMPLOYEES RETIREMENT SYSTEM OR CALPERS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE CALPERS NOTICE SEVERAL YEARS AGO THAT PRICES FOR MANY COMMON SERVICES VARY PRETTY WIDELY. THE CALPERS THAT HAVE ACCESS TO AN ALL PAYER CLAIMS DATABASE BUT IS DEVELOPED OVER-THE LAST OF YEARS A PRETTY SOPHISTICATED APPROACH FOR THINKING ABOUT PRICES WITHIN THEIR THEIR OWN EMPLOYEE POPULATION. JUST EXAMPLES OF THE PRICE RANGE THAT THE CALPERS FACED THIS SLIDE SHOWS THE RANGE IN PRICES FOR COST PLEASE ON THE LEFT. ONE OF THINGS THAT THE CALPERS NOTICED. THAT PRICES FOR CORNOS BEES LIKE MANY OTHER SERVICES RANGE PRETTY DRASTICALLY SO HERE PRICES RANGE FROM A LOW OF ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS. ALL THE WAY UP TO TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. THE OTHER THING THAT CALPERS NOTICED. IS THAT THERE ARE MANY DID PROVIDER DELIVERY ORGANIZATIONS THAT DELIVER COMMENTS SERVICES BUT CHARGE DRASTICALLY DIFFERENT PRICES. ONE OF THINGS THAT THE CALPERS NOTICE FOR COST PLEASE IS THAT HOSPITAL OUTPATIENT DEPARTMENTS OF OUTPATIENT FACILITY- OPERATION UNIT AFFILIATED WITH A HOSPITAL. TEND TO CHARGE PRICES THAT ABOUT TWICE THE PRICE AS OF AMADOR SURGICAL CENTERS WHICH TEND TO BE INDEPENDENT AND FREESTANDING CENTERS. CALPERS IMPLEMENTED A REFERENCE BASED PRICING PROGRAM WHERE THEY THE- THRESHOLD ADD TO THAT- FROM ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS RATHER. INDICATED BY THE BLACK LINE HERE. AND SHIFTED PATIENTS TO LOWER PRICE PROVIDERS USING FINANCIAL INCENTIVES. IN A STUDY PUBLISHED BY- OUR COLLEAGUES AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY HIGH WE DOCUMENTED THAT ONCE CALPERS IMPLEMENTED THIS PROGRAM. PATIENTS SHIFTED PRETTY DRASTICALLY TOWARDS LOWER PRICE PROVIDERS. AND SO ON THE RIGHT FIGURE WE SHOW THE INCREASE ADOPTION OF LOWER PRICED PROVIDERS FOLLOWING IMPLEMENTATION THE PROGRAM CALPERS THE REDLINE RELATIVE TO COMPARISON GROUP RATHER CALIFORNIA PURCHASERS THE BLUE LINE. AND TO THESE TYPES OF PROGRAMS LEVERAGE OF PRICE TRANSPARENCY. WHICH IS SIMILAR TO THE DATA BEING COLLECTED THROUGH AN ALL PAYER CLAIMS DATABASE BUT THE PAIR WITH BENEFIT DOT DESIGN INFORMATION AND FINANCIAL INCENTIVES. TO ENCOURAGE THE USE OF LOWER PRICE PROVIDERS. THE CLIPPERS. AND SO IS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS THINKING IT ABOUT LEVERAGING SOME OF THE INFORMATION COLLECTED THROUGH PRICE TRANSPARENCY I THINK THERE'S AN IMPORTANT ROLE- THAT THE CALIFORNIA CAN CONSIDER IN TERMS OF PROMOTING SOME OF THE WORK THAT THE CALPERS IS DONE. FROM MY VIEWPOINT CALPERS IS ONE OF THE MOST INNOVATIVE PURCHASERS OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES THE UNITED STATES. THEY'VE PIONEERED PROGRAMS SUCH AS REFERENCE PRICING AND MORRIS. AND THEY'VE ADDRESSED PRIVATE POLICIES TO ADDRESS PRICE VARIATION OF HIGH PRICES FOR A VARIETY OF SERVICES INCLUDING OUTPATIENT SERVICES INPATIENT SERVICES. AND ALSO PHARMACEUTICAL SERVICES. AND SO I THINK A TERM AMOUNT OF. FOR THE STATE OF TO HIRE SOME OF THE WORKERS IS DOING TO IMPLEMENT INNOVATIVE BENEFITS. AND TO POTENTIALLY ALLOW OTHER EMPLOYERS TO LEARN FROM SOME OF THE WORK CALPERS IS DOING AND IN SOME SENSE ADOPTED BEING DONE IN THEIR OWN BACKYARD. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. THE CLUB IS. AND SO IT IS WERE AWESOME THINK ABOUT PREVIOUS LIKELY. AT OTHER POLICIES. I THINK IT'S A PER TO THINK TO KEEP IN MY- JUST THE ROLE OF ENSURE ACT TO. MARKET TO GET. AND WE CAN'T. AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE. IF PROVIDE MARKETS ARE NOT. AND IF PATIENTS TO HAVE AND TO LOWER COST PER. AS I HIGHLIGHTED. THERE MAY NORTH CALIFORNIA MARKET. WHERE THE HEALTH TO SYSTEM FRANKLY IS NOT COMPETITIVE. AND SO THERE MAY NEED TO BE OVERSIGHT OF MARKETS OR POLICIES THAT THE PLATE PUT IN PLACE PRICE LIMITS FOR MARKETS THAT BUT FRANKLY ARE NOT COMPETITIVE. SECOND WE KNOW THAT CONSOLIDATION IS DRIVEN BY BY PRICING DIFFERENTIALS. AND SO REGULATORS MAY WANT TO CONSIDER SOME OF THESE UNDERLYING PRICE DIFFERENCES THAT PROVIDE THE- THE GROUNDWORK FOR CONSOLIDATION AND PROVIDE INCENTIVES FOR CONSOLIDATION THAT WE SEE HAPPENING CALIFORNIA. ONE ONE POTENTIAL EXAMPLE WOULD BE TO THINK ABOUT POLICIES THAT LIMIT FACILITY FEES FOR SERVICES THAT DON'T HAPPEN IN IN- FACILITY SERVICES ARE HAPPENING NON FACILITY AS A SET OF CARE. THIS IS A SYSTEM OR A OF PRICING MAR THAT SCRIPT OFTEN INTEGRATION FOR BECAUSE- AND ABOUT WAYS TO ADDRESS THAT DR OF INTEGRATION. MORE DIRECTLY BE SOME THAT MIGHT A POTENTIAL. REDUCING THE OF FOR INTEGRATION. AND THEN FOR I ABOUT I OF NETWORK EARLIER. I DON'T BILLS OR SOMETHING LEAD TO LOTS OF FINANCE DISTRESS FOR CAO. AND OTHERS WHO RECEIVE A NETWORK. BUT THEY ARE PLAY IMPORTANT ROLE IN LEADING TO HIGHER NEGOTIATED FOR IN NETWORK SERVICES. IN A RECENT. BY BY IN A UNIVERSE OF THE CALL DUFFY AND I DOCUMENTED HOW MUCH CAL. ANOTHER COULD SAVE IF ADDED THAT POLICY WERE WORD. AN ESSENTIAL IF WE THOUGHT ABOUT POLICY THAT LIMIT HOW MUCH PATIENTS A WRIST. FOR OUT OF NETWORK CARE. IN OUR PAPER WILL BE FOR. WHAT WE- WAS THAT IF. WAS TO THINK ABOUT A THAT WOULD CAP. AT A NETWORK BILL AT 2% MEDICARE. INTO A FEW KEY A OUT OF NETWORK BILL. THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT THAT YOU IS A PATIENT FOR IS 2% MEDIC. THE BATTLE PLACE DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON HOW ENDEAVOR PRICES ARE OR GOING TO GO SHADED AND COULD LEAD SAVINGS OF 30% OVER FOR IN PRICE. AT THE SAME TIME THE ALTERNATIVE APPROACH OF INSTEAD OF CAPPING RELATIVE TO MEDICARE. AND INSTEAD TYING TO THE AVERAGE PRICE IN CALIFORNIA. WOULD RELEASE TWO WOULD RESULT IN. SIMILAR SAVINGS OF A TWO SEVEN PER. NEXT I PLEASE. AND THIRD DISAGREED THE CAL HEALTH CARE LANDSCAPE VARIOUS. AS I'VE DISCUSSED A FEW TIME. HI PRICES IN NORTHERN. OUR TRIP BY MARKET CUTS. AND THE BEEN SEVERAL THE DOCUMENTED THE MARKET STRUCTURE FOR PROVIDER DELIVERY SYSTEM NORTHERN CALIFORNIA IS IT NOT A LIAR COMPARED THE REST COUNTRY. K. CAN CAN USE BOTH PRICE TRENDS. AND MARKET OVER TO PROMOTE. IN TWO TO MAKE HEALTH CARE MORE FOR MORE FOR BECAUSE- BUT WHILE DOING SO WE NEED TO. THE VOTING PATIENTS IN THE POOR THAT SERVE THE PATIENTS STILL HAVE ADEQUATE ACCESS TO PROVIDE. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME AND HAPPY TO ANSWERING OTHER QUESTION. HOW YOU VERY MUCH DOCTOR IT'S A YOU GIVE US A LOT OF VALUE AND- WE'VE NOW FOR QUITE A WHILE THAT PRICES NORFOLK. ARE DEAF HIGHER THAN SOUTHERN. I GUESS- WITH YOUR CHART YOUR BY IS A IS A TRIP IT WAS. OF THAT AND- YOU KNOW I GUESS PART OF ME WONDERS YOU KNOW HAVE BEEN SOMEONE WHO LIVES IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WHEN YOU- THE YOU LOOK AT THAT AND THE STARK DIFFERENCE THERE DO WONDER IF THIS IS. I HAVE A HARD TIME BELIEVING THAT THE COST OF THE LIVER CARE IS THAT MUCH HIGHER RIGHT THIS FEELS LIKE MAYBE IT'S HIGHER BECAUSE IT CAN BE HIGHER- AND- I THINK WE MIGHT HEAR SOME OF ABOUT A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT AND THERE YEAH BUT YOU KNOW WITH. GARCIA CONSOLIDATION BUT I DO AS YOU LOOK AT THAT TOO IT IS IT IS IT REALLY IS A DOUBLE WHAMMY WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE TABLE TO CALIFORNIA'S THERE BECAUSE- NOT ONLY ARE YOU PAYING YOU KNOW A THIRTY ONE PERCENT. INCREASE IN THE HOSPITAL INPATIENT HOSPITAL PRICES- YOU'RE ALSO. PAIN IN OF FOR THREE PER HIGHER. SO THOSE. HAVE TO BE CONNECTED IN SOME SO YOU'RE GETTING YOUR GETTING A DOUBLE WHAMMY THERE. THAT MORE THAN OFFSETS THE 4% DIFFERENCE IN IN SALARIES. AND YET YOUR PRICE A HOME MIGHT BE LOWER BUT- BUT IF YOU GET A BIG NASTY HEALTH CARE BILL- THAT DOESN'T FEEL SO GOOD AND IT REALLY PROBABLY DOES MAKE MUCH DIFFERENCE IN YOUR OVERALL QUALITY OF LIFE SO. SO I WANT TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE INFORMATION I SUSPECT WILL HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL. OF FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS WE AT SOME POINT. BUT I ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT YOUR BUILDINGS GOING TO CLOSE IN ONE MINUTE. AND UNLESS YOU WANT TO SPEND THE NIGHT THERE YOU KNOW. YOU KNOW WE MAY NEED TO MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT BIGGER. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION I REALLY APPRECIATE IT SO. AND IT IS NOT IS MR. SO INTERVIEW. TO STOP. MISTER NAZARIAN. THEIR PHONE. IF HE IS I WANT TO GO ME A SHOT. AT REAL QUICK IF. MAY MAYBE NOT AT THIS. SO OKAY. WE WILL GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON TO OUR FINAL SPEAKER I WANT TO. AND APOLOGY THANK YOU MISTER GRAINY GRAINY. FOR YOUR PATIENCE I APOLOGIZE FOR CHANGING THE ORDER NUMBER WE HEARD YOUR BUILDING DOESN'T CLOSE UNTIL FIVE THIRTY SO MY APOLOGIES SINCERE APOLOGIES. THE MR GREEN IS THE A VISITING OF LAW AT THE UC LED HASTINGS LAW SCHOOL AND HE'S GOING TO TALK TO US ABOUT HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION SO PLEASE WHENEVER YOU'RE READY SIR AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PATIENCE REALLY APPRECIATE IT. GERMAN WOULDN'T THANK YOU FOR THE COMMITTEE FOR THE INVITATION- IT'S REALLY- A PLEASURE TO TALK ABOUT THIS IMPORTANT SUBJECT. YOU KNOW AS ACADEMICS WE DEFINE AN IMPORTANT SUBJECT IS SOMETHING WE'VE BEEN WRITING ABOUT. AND I'VE BEEN SPENDING MOST OF MY CAREER FIRST AS A- A TRIAL LAWYER AND- SUPERVISOR IN THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IN WASHINGTON. GOVERNING HEALTHCARE ANTI TRUST MATTERS AND IN THE LAST THIRTY YEARS AS A TEACHER AND A- A WRITER AND AN OCCASIONAL KITS ARE ABOUT HEALTHCARE POLICY. I'M SO I'M GONNA GO QUICKLY OVER SOME OF THE ECONOMICS DATA THAT YOU'VE YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT. A MORE TO SET UP WHAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHICH IS LAW AND WE HAVEN'T TALKED THAT MUCH ABOUT LAW AND REGULATION. AND YOU KNOW THAT I THINK IS THE CRITICAL JUNCTURE WE'RE AT NOW WITH SO MUCH CONCENTRATION. HE HAD SO MUCH ATTENTION BEING PAID TO HEALTH CARE SO IF. YOU'LL GO TO THE FIRST SLIDE PLEASE. OKAY THIS IS TO A NIFTY IF YOU'LL AT THE RIGHT HAND THAT THAT WOULD BE A 100% TREATY CALIFORNIA- OF THE UNITED STATES RATHER. AS A HUNDRED PERCENT. CAN YOU SEE ALL THOSE DOTS SCATTERED AROUND THOSE ARE DOTS OF OTHER COUNTRIES FOR EACH OF THOSE PROCEDURES EVERYTHING FROM HIP REPLACEMENTS AND ANGIOPLASTY TO CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION AND SO FORTH. AND YOU SEE THERE JUST A FRACTION OF THE UNITED STATES CHARGES. AND IF YOU HIT THE SLIDE ONE MORE TIME YOU'LL SEE A POP UP- GOING ON. AND THE ANSWER THE IS THAT PRICE ARE PRIMARY REASON THE U. S. SPENDS MORE THE WONDERFUL ARTICLE WAS WRITTEN YEARS AGO BY A- TERRIFIC ECONOMIST WITH A REINHARDT. AT ANY IT IT'S THE PRICE STUPID AND I WAS TRYING TO CONVINCE. POLICY MIGHT. MAKERS THIS WAS FIFTY YEARS AGO THAT YOU DON'T PAY A TO PRICES THAT'S THE REAL DRIVER OF HEALTH HEALTH CARE AND I THINK THAT'S REAL FOCUS THE FOCUS HAS TO BE- COULD ENCOURAGE. A NUMBER OF YOU SPEAKERS SAID IT'S NOT DIVERT. IT'S NOT UTILIZATION IT'S AND IT'S CERTAINLY NOT QUALITY OR OUTCOMES WE ARE A LITTLE WE ARE LAGGING THE WORLD AND IN THE END QUALITY. CRAFTED OKAY NEXT COULD SLOW. COULD YOU PUT THE MICRO CLOSE TO YOU AND SO CAN HEAR YOU BETTER. SURE. AT SURE. THE THING YOU. THE UP. IF YOU COULD HIT THE NEXT SLIDE THE- THIS IS THAT IT REVEALED BY THIS IN THE DATA YOU HEARD ORAL TODAY HOSPITAL BECAUSE IN CALIFORNIA ARE EX. AND WHAT THIS LAW ILLUSTRATES IS THAT. A BIG OF LAW INCREASES OUR HOSPITAL SYSTEMS THAT IS ENTITIES THAT OWN THREE OR MORE HOSPITALS- AND MULTI HOSPITAL SYSTEMS ARE REALLY THE LARGEST DRIVER OF COST THEY WERE THE TARGET OF THE SUTTER CASE THAT I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT IN A LITTLE LITTLE WHILE BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT CONCENTRATION REALLY DOES DRIVE COSTS HERE. WHEN HIT THE NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. THIS JUST REPEAT WHAT YOU JUST HEARD FROM THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER AND IT'S JUST A SNAPSHOT OF THE NORTH SOUTH DIVIDE IN CALIFORNIA WITH THIS. SHOWING A 30% DIFF IN IN NORTH FOR SOUTH. OF IT WHAT'S THE X. FOR ALL THIS WELL. CERTAINLY CONCENTRATE IS I THINK MOST OF. AGREE THE REASON THE BOTTOM DRY OF HI COSTS AND DO WE MEAN BY CA. YOU COULD ACCOUNTS. AS A SHORE. FOR LACK OF COMPETITION TOO FEW COMPETITORS HAVE WITH THEIR TOO FEW COMPETITORS JUST A COUPLE OF GAS STATIONS ACROSS THE STREET FROM EACH OTHER. THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE NO INCENTIVE TO DRIVE PRICES DOWN AND THAT'S THE STORY THROUGHOUT ECONOMIC HISTORY AND IT'S CERTAINLY THE STORY IN HEALTHCARE JUST TONS OF ECONOMIC STUDIES. SHOWING JUST THAT WHEN I GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE. SO THIS IS THIS CHART IS A IT A NOTABLE ONE. UP IN A MAY BE A LITTLE HARD TO READ. BUT IT IT DISPLAYS THE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF. CONCENTRATION IN CALIFORNIA. NOW THE WAY TO THINK ABOUT CONCENTRATION IS THERE'S A LEVEL AT WHICH THE LAW THE ECONOMISTS AND OTHERS SAY IS HIGHLY CONCENTRATED. AND THAT LEVEL IS AROUND BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND THREE THOUSAND ON THIS H. H. I. INDEX. SO IF YOU LOOK IF YOU TO AN IMAGINARY LINE RIGHT BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND THREE THOUSAND AT TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED THAT'S WHERE WE REALLY START TO WORRY ABOUT CONCENTRATION. AND WE'RE GOING TO SEE YOU SEE THAT THE BOTTOM LEVEL THE LEVEL THAT'S PRIMARY CARE IT'S BELOW THAT LEVEL SO MOST PRIMARY CARE PRACTICES ARE NOT HIGHLY CONCENTRATED. BUT AS YOU MOVE UP YOU SEE THE INSURANCE THE NEXT LINE UP THE SCALE THE INSURANCE MARKET IS. SOMEWHAT HIGHLY CONCENTRATED CERTAINLY ABOVE TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED. AND AS YOU GO FURTHER UP THE NUMBERS BECOME ASTRONOMICAL- SPECIALTY PHYSICIANS AT FORTY. ONE HUNDRED S. LEVEL AN HOSPITALS AT FIVE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED NINETY FIVE IN CALIFORNIA JUST TO GIVE YOU WHAT THE SNAPSHOT OF WHAT THAT MEANS. THAT HIGH CONCENTRATION RATE AT THE HOSPITAL LEVEL THIS MEANS IT'S A ONE HOSPITAL TOWN STE THE HOSPITAL HAS SEVENTY MAYBE 75% OF THE OF THE PATIENT ADMISSIONS. AND MAYBE ANOTHER HOSPITAL HAS TENER OR FIFTEEN. SO THAT'S THAT'S WHERE WE ARE IN CALIFORNIA HIGH CONCENTRATION ACROSS. THE BOARD NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. WHAT I JUST TALKING ABOUT IS HOW. COMPTON COUNTS. FEW COMPETITORS FOR EACH HOSPITAL IN THEIR MARKET VIEW COMPETITORS FOR EACH SPECIALTY PHYSICIAN IN THEIR MARKET. NOW I'M TURNING TO VERTICAL CONCENTRATION AND BY VERTICAL AS A COUPLE SPEAKERS HAVE MENTIONED VERTICAL CONCENTRATION HAS TO DO WITH HOSPITALS ACQUIRING PHYSICIANS- END. DID ECONOMICS WE SAY YOU REQUIRE AN IMP TORQUE. TO YOUR SIR. IN CAN SEE IS DE INCREASE IN THE OF HIGH. PRACTICES THAT HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED BY ODDS FISTS GIVE PHYSICIAN PRACTICE THE HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED BY HOSPITAL. SPECIALTY. PRACTICES ARE NOW UP 252% OWNED BY. OR COULD BY HOW. AND FORTY TWO PER FOR PRIMARY. OKAY SO LET'S JUMP TO THE NEXT SLIDE SO WHAT IS THIS ALL WE US WELL. THE TAKE AWAY HERE IS. THIS IS THE L. THAT INCREASE CONCENTRATE. LEADS TO HIGHER PROVIDE PROVIDER PRICES SO HIGHER. CONCENTRATION MEANS THEY CAN BARGAIN FOR HIGHER PRICES AND HIGHER PRICES LEAD TO HIGHER PREMIUMS THAT'S THE SCENARIO THAT I THINK THE OVERWHELMING NUMBER OF STUDIES AND ECONOMIST AGREE ON I WON'T GO INTO ANY AT THE DATA THAT MUCH THE FIRST THE FIRST. BULLET POINT SHOWS YOU THAT EVEN NIGHT WITH A MODEST INCREASE OF CONCENTRATION- YOU SEE IN A THOUSAND DOLLAR A YEAR INCREASE IN IN PRICES- STUDIES HAVE SHOWN INCREASES OF 2240% AFTER MERGERS OF CLOSELY. RELATED HOSPITALS IN LOCAL MARKETS. SO TO WITH PHYSICIAN. CONCENTRATION CRITIC POSITION CRISIS CONCENTRATION RES IN HIGH PRICE. TO GO DOWN TO THE THIRD LOW WHAT IS HAVE TO DO WITH WITH COST. ACAP ARE A GOOD MATCH. AND IT TURNS OUT THAT FOR TO AND IS A- WITH HIGHER PRICES THESE THREE STUDIES OUR ROLE FROM THE PETROUS. GROUP AT THE BERKELEY AND THEY'VE DONE JUST REMARKABLE STUDIES AND THEY SOME OF THEIR STUDIES WERE INSTEAD. IN GETTING TO HELP BRING THE- THE SUTTER CASE AND FINALLY THE LAST ONE'S REALLY INTERESTING BECAUSE NOW THERE'S A STUDY COMING OUT OF STANFORD- BY LAWRENCE BAKER SHOWING THAT. WHEN SPECIALIST INTEGRATE WITH GENERALIST WITH PRIMARY CARE THE PRICES OF BOTH GO UP WITHOUT NOTABLE INCREASES IN QUALITY SO. THE POTENTIAL FOR HIGHER PRICES OCCURS ACROSS THE BOARD WHEN THERE'S CONCENTRATION. WE COULD GET FLIPPED TO THE NEXT SLIDE. THIS THIS NEXT. FOCUS ON THE CULPRITS WHO ARE THEY AND HOW TO WE GET HERE THAT FOR COOPER AND I SHOULD MENTION I NINE YEARS AS AN IN WITH THE JUST TO AND EACH DIVISION AND THERE HAS BEEN UNDER ENFORCEMENT OF ANTITRUST MERGER LAW A PERIOD OF SEVEN YEARS ELAPSED IN THE LATE NINETIES UP WHEN NO CASES WERE BROUGHT AND THAT. GAVE A BRIGHT GREEN LIGHT TO MERGERS CONSOLIDATION WENT ON A PACE AND WE SAW A HUGE INCREASE IN MERGERS RESULTING AND CONCENTRATION- THIS IS BEEN REVERSED EXTENT BUT THERE HAVE BEEN A SERIES OF A RONI IS. BY THE COURTS NOW AS A LAW PROFESSOR LIKE DECLINE THE COURTS NO DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING BUT IN THE CASE THE DATA ACTUALLY IT. STAY OF RETROSPECTIVE STUDIES HOSPITAL MERGERS THAT WERE ALLOWED TO GO THROUGH. THEY WENT TO TRIAL AT A COURT APPROVED THEM THESE RETROSPECTIVE STUDIES- THE PRICES DID IN FACT INCREASE AS WAS PREDICTED BY THE GOVERNMENT. SO THOSE CASES PLUS THE GREEN LIGHT OF UNDER ENFORCEMENT REALLY LEAD TO CONCENTRATION. WHAT ELSE IS OUT THERE WELL AS YOU'VE JUST HEARD. FROM FOR MR WILEY THE- THERE WERE GAPS IN BREAK. AND IN FACT SOME RAKE. ACTUALLY ENCOURAGE MERGERS YOU HEARD HIM TALK ABOUT PAYMENTS. THAT WE PHYSICIAN AT. OF SOAK SIDE OF SERVICE. AND THERE'RE A NUMBER OF OTHERS I'VE WRITTEN A COUPLE PAPERS THAT TRY TO. WHERE THE RED BROTHER FELL BY ACTUALLY. CONCENTRATION WITHOUT HELPING CONSUMERS ANOTHER ANOTHER- BECAUSE OF CONCENTRATION IS WHAT I CALL THE ACA MAY BE DO WHAT DEFENSE THEY SAY ALL THE ACA WANTED EVERYBODY TO GET TOGETHER OF WANTED INTEGRATION. NOTHING COULD BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH I SOMETIMES TELL MY STUDENTS YOUR DOCTOR MAY TELL YOU AND DOCTORS HAVE FOUND YOU KNOW A GLASS OF WINE WITH DINNER MAY BE GOOD FOR YOUR CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM. BUT YOUR DOCTOR WOULD TELL YOU DON'T DRINK THREE BOTTLES OF WINE WITH DINNER- THAT'S THE THAT'S THE FALLACY THAT THAT SO OFTEN PORTRAYED BY SOME OF THE- MERGING PARTIES THAT THEY'RE JUST. TO REGULATION THAT IS NOT WHAT THE ACA WAS ABOUT AND FINALLY WILL THIS CREATED WHAT I CALL A GOLD RUSH MENTALITY HOSPITALS BEGAN TO THINK BOY IF I DON'T REQUIRE MY NEIGHBOR SOMEONE ELSE WILL OR IF I DON'T GRAB A POLE WITH. SO ELSE WILL. WE GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE. SO THE NEXT LINE I I'D I JUST AS WELL ABOUT A TRUST LAW. WE HAVE A HIGH TWENTY. OF IT FOR OF AN H. LAW WE'VE- UP SOME BIG WE'VE- STOPPED. COULD AND AREAS WHAT'S GOING ON WELL FIRST OF ALL I MENTIONED THE SEVEN YEARS NEGLECT THAT. TO THESE- A LOT OF THE CONSOLIDATION AND BY THE WAY LET ME JUST MENTION THE COURTS HAVE RIGHTED THE SHIP. THE LAST FIVE OR SIX CASES BROUGHT BY THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IN FTC. HAVE REALLY CORRECTED THE ERRORS OF THE OF THE EARLIER CASES THERE'S A MAJOR CASES PENDING RIGHT NOW IN FACT THERE'S A MAJOR ONE IN PHILADELPHIA OF JEFFERSON HOSPITAL IN. EINSTEIN HOSPITAL BUT I THINK I THINK IT BE SAID THAT THE COOK THE LAW REALLY HAS HAS CLASS. THE STANDARDS BUT IN SOME WAYS THE HORSES OUT OF THE BARN. WHAT ABOUT CONDUCT CAN ANY TRUST REALLY PENAT SHOULD DANNY TRUST REALLY PENALIZE. BAD ACTS. ACTION BY DA PER. WELL HERE'S THE THING THAT A LOT OF GOOD CERTAINLY A LOT OF LA PEOPLE TO KNOW. ANTI TO. DOES NOT PROHIBIT MEN ARE PRICE. THERE'S NOT IN THE LAW THAT SAYS AMANDA. CAN CHARGE HIGH. OLYMPIC LAW DOES. IS SAY. ANTI THAT DOMINATE CAN'T DO THAT MAKE. THEIR MEN ARE THAT ARE IN. OR OBTAIN THE MONOPOLY. SO WHICH WAS THE- AT. HOLDING ONTO YOUR MAY NOT BY. MEANS BUT YOU'VE GOT IT YOU CAN CHARGE PRICE IN A- IS A PAY TIGER WITH TO GO TO THAT. KIND OF CONDUCT. AND FOR RELYING ON IT EACH LIVE IS DIFFICULT BECAUSE IT'S SO COSTLY AND THESE CASES TAKE FOR EVER TO BE. TO BE FINISHED. AND THE ONLY APPLIED TO ONE PARTY. SO WHEN YOU ONE SUIT ONE WITH OTHER WOULD PAY ATTENTION. AND NOT DO THE SAME THING HAVE GOTTEN GAUGE OF THE MERGER. BUT SOMETIME IT'S WERE IT I IS THIS I USE TO HEAR SO OF MY FRIEND AND PRIVATE PRACTICE UNDER. THE SAID THERE'S NO WAY THERE NO MERGE NOT TRY. IT OKAY THROWN IN. YOU DON'T IN A SERIOUS TROUBLE LOSE SOME IN. BUT IT MIGHT WORTH IT TO TRY TO GO MY- AND FIND ANOTHER. IS THAT THERE'S AN ADDED IN FOR. OFTEN THE IN JUSTO KNOW WHEN TO BE THE CASES HAVE ACCESS TO EXPERTS AT CETERA AND THAT'S WHY I THINK THE DISCUSSION WE'VE BEEN HAVING ABOUT THE HPC IS REALLY IMPORTANT. HAVING THAT EXPERT AT THE ALREADY TO HELP IS REALLY IMPORTANT. CAN WE FLIP TO THE NEXT SLIDE- OKAY I GOT A BUNCH OF MINUTES I WOULD JUST WANT TO BRIEF ADDRESS ABOUT CONSOLIDATION. THE FIRST ONE I'VE WRITTEN A COUPLE PAPERS ON THIS I CALL IT THE SUMO WRESTLER FALLACY. AND THE IDEA HERE IS THAT SOME PEOPLE ASSUME IN SOME COURTS OF ACTUALLY SORT OF ASSUMED. THAT CONSUMERS ARE BETTER OFF WHEN YOU HAVE A BIG INSURER HEALTH INSURER. BUMPING ITS BELLY AGAINST A BIG HOSPITAL SYSTEM. THE TWO WILL JUST ORT OF DUKE IT OUT IN THE RING AND CONSUMERS WILL BE BETTER OFF. AGAIN NOTHING COULD BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH ECONOMIC THEORY DOESN'T SUPPORT THAT. AND ECONOMIC HISTORY DOESN'T SUPPORT THAT WE HAVE A NUMBER OF CASES WHERE THE TWO WRESTLERS SHOOK HANDS THERE'S A FAMOUS CASE UP IN BOSTON WITH THE DOMINANT. INSURER IN THE DOMINANT HOSPITAL SYSTEM. ESSENTIALLY HAD BUT THE BOSTON GLOBE CALLED A HANDSHAKE IN THE SNOW. SO IT'S JUST AS EASY FOR THEM TO TAKE CARE OF EACH OTHER AS IT IS TO CONCLUDE. ANOTHER METHOD X. IS THE I THAT MARK ARE SELF CORRECT AND IN SOME AREAS SURE ENTRY AND OTHER FACTORS CAN CORRECT. MARKET POWER AND DEAL WITH. A DOMINANT FIRMS IN INNOVATION CAN CHANGE THINGS. THAT ISN'T THE CASE IN HEALTHCARE THEIR ENORMOUS BARRIERS TO ENTRY AND ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SOME IMPORTANT INNOVATIONS THAT NEED TO BE ENCOURAGED INCLUDING TELEMEDICINE. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO. REPLACE THE NEED FOR IN IN PATIENT CARE. AND HOSPITALS HAVE BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL IN MOVING TO OUTPATIENT CARE DOMINANCE AS WELL. FINALLY ANOTHER BIT IS THAT QUALITY IMPROVES EXERCISE INCREASES. AGAIN THE ECONOMIC STUDIES DON'T SUPPORT THAT- THEIR NUMBER OF CAUGHT THE ECONOMIC STUDIES OUT THERE THAT SHOW AT BEST. QUALITY REMAINS NEUTRAL IN FACT THERE SEVERAL STUDIES THAT SAY QUALITY WORSENS AS YOU GET BIGGER AND BIGGER- THERE ARE CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THERE IS A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE VOLUME OF. SERVICES PROVIDED AND QUALITY THERE THOSE HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO EXIST IN THE- IN TRAUMA AND A FEW OTHERS. BUT THERE'S CERTAINLY NO REASON FOR IT ACROSS THE BOARD LENIENCY. SHOULD WE THROW GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. ONE LAST MYTH THE IDEA THAT SELL. IS INTO IT'S AN- COULD. MEET REAL MEANS JUST BRINGING ENTITIES. INTEGRATE REALLY MAY DOING THE HARD OF GETTING RID OF THE IT FOR. PROP THE SILO EFFECTS AND ALL THE OTHER EFFECTS THAT PLAGUE THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. AND THIS SAID ONE OF THE TOP ECONOMIST PUT IT I THINK PRETTY WELL WHEN HE SAID CONSOLIDATION WAS PRIMARILY FOR THE PURPOSE OF ENHANCING THE BARGAINING POWERS OF THE MERGING PARTIES. VIS A VIS THE PAYERS AND IT DIDN'T LEAD TO REAL INTEGRATION. AND ANOTHER POINT HE'S MADE ANOTHER SURVEY YOU DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO MERGE WITH. A RIVAL TO GET THE BENEFITS OF INTEGRATION YOU CAN DO THAT BY JOINT VENTURES AND OTHER KINDS OF ARRANGEMENTS THAT ARE SHORT OF MERGER BECAUSE MERGERS REMEMBER MERGERS FOR AND JOINT VENTURE ARE LESS LESS PER MINUTE. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. OKAY SO LET ME JUST CLOSE BY BY GOING THROUGH A COUPLE OF. IMPORTANT AT. POLICY PAPERS THAT WE'VE DONE IT YOU HASTINGS LAW SCHOOL AND ARE WORKING WITH THE FOLKS AT THAT THE PETROUS CENTER AT BERKELEY- WE'VE LOOKED AT DEB. PARTICULARLY AT THE CONDUCT OF DOMINANT PROVIDER AND PAYERS AND WE'VE ISOLATED A NUMBER OF SO CALLED ANTI COMPETITIVE CONTRACTING CLAUSES. AND THESE ARE CLOSE IS THE DOMINANT HOSPITALS IN PARTICULAR UP PUT IN PLACE THAT KEEP THEIR MONOPOLY- MOST FAVORED NATIONS CLAUSES ANTI STEERING ANTI TEARING GAG CLAUSES AS TO PRICE ALL OR NOTHING CONTRACTED EXCLUSIVE DEALING. AND THE IDEA HERE IS THAT EACH OF ONE OF THESE AND- IT LOOKS LIKE I'M NOT CONNECT TIME TO GO INTO MUCH DETAIL BUT EACH ONE OF THESE ARE SORT OF DEVICES TO PRESERVE MARKET POWER JUST TAKE ANTI STEERING FOR A MINUTE ANTI STEERING REALLY SAYS- THE DOMINANT HOSPITAL SAYS TO THE INSURER. DON'T PUT ME IN A LESS FAVORED TIER WITH YOUR BENEFICIARIES DON'T MAKE THEM PAY HIGHER- HIGHER COPAY. FOR ME BECAUSE IF YOU DO I'M GOING TO DROP. I'M GOING TO DROP OUT OF YOUR NETWORK AND IF I DROP OUT OF YOUR NETWORK YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SELL ANY AND SHARON'S THOSE KIND OF CLOSES ARE REALLY TAILOR MADE TO HELP MONOPOLIST MAINTAIN ITS MARKET POWER. ALL OR NOTHING CLOSES ARE ANOTHER ONE IN WHICH THE DOMINANT HOSPITAL SAYS- YOU WANT MY MUST HAVE HOSPITAL THE HOSPITAL YOU REALLY NEEDED AND- IN- IN OAKLAND OR OR BERKELEY HE REALLY NEED THAT HOSPITAL WELL YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO PAY THAT SAME HIGH PRICE FOR MY OTHER HOSPITALS. WHERE I DON'T HAVE MARKET POWER WHERE THERE IS REAL COMPETITION THOSE ARE JUST TWO EXAMPLES. IN THAT THESE WERE REALLY PART OF THE BECAUSE THE EVIDENCE THAT WAS GOING TO BE PRESENTED IN THE CASE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL BROUGHT AGAINST SUTTER HEALTH AND THERE IS ANOTHER CASE IS STILL PENDING THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S CASE ALONG WITH THE OTHER HE BROUGHT BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND A UNION. ARE IN THE PROCESS OF BEING SETTLED WITH THE A DECREE THAT WILL CURB THEIR CONDUCT- BUT THERE IS A CONCERN I HAVE HERE AT LEAST THAT. I THINK THEY WERE THE SETTLEMENT IS A- AND NOW. BUT IN WAYS WERE WHACK A MOLE WITH DOMINO HOSP THEY WILL COME UP WITH WAYS OF AROUND SOME OF THE SOME OF THE- SOME OF THE FIXES WE PUT IT. OKAY LET ME JUST BRIEFLY GO OVER A COUPLE OF THE TWO OF POLICY PAPERS WE'VE PUT OUT COULD I GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. THE FIRST ONE REALLY GOES BACK TO THE QUESTION OF CAN WE IMPROVE JUST MERGER ENFORCEMENT CAN WE REALLY GET. AT LEAST WITH RESPECT TO MERGERS GOING FORWARD FROM NOW ON CAN WE GET BETTER ATTENTION PAID TO THEM. AND HERE I THINK THE STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL CAN PLAY THAT ADAM PORTEN ROLE AND CERTAINLY- THE CALIFORNIA STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS BEEN A LEADER- IT NOT JUST THIS ATTORNEY GENERAL PICK FOR YEARS PAST HAS BEEN A LEADER IN IN THIS AREA- AND WHAT DO THEY NEED. WHAT DO THEY NEED WHAT THEY MIGHT NEED SOME LEGISLATIVE HELP TO IMPROVE THEIR PERFORMANCE ONE IS THEY SHOULD HAVE PRIOR NOTICE OF ALL MERGERS MANY MERGERS ARE UNDER THE RADAR SCREEN THEY OCCUR AND ONCE A MERGER HAPPENS. IT IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO CHALLENGE BECAUSE YOU CAN'T UNSCRAMBLE THE EGG THE PEOPLE HAVE THE MERGING PARTIES HAVE REARRANGED THEIR BUSINESS. THEY LAID PEOPLE OFF SO UNLESS THEY GET PRIOR NOTICE- IT'S VERY HARD AND THEY'RE JUST I. DON'T HAVE TIME TO GO INTO IT BUT THERE'S BEEN A BIG MOVEMENT AMONG HEDGE FUNDS TO ACQUIRE PRACTICES AROUND THE COUNTRY AND THOSE HAVE BEEN LARGELY INVISIBLE. YOU MIGHT ALSO WANT PRIOR APPROVAL BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS A FIRST CRACK AT IT. AND THEN IT'S UP TO THE PARTIES TO APPEAL. INPUT IS IMPORTANT DATA AND WE HAVE TO MENTION BEFORE HAVING ALL. AT ALL PAYER DATABASE IS A- SO THE GENERAL COULD DO A BETTER JOB- YOU MIGHT HAVE GROW. AS SUCH STANDARDS APPLY YOU CERTAINLY OUGHT TO HAVE. LOOKED AT MERGERS THAT YOU HAVE LET GO LET GO THROUGH. TAKE A LOOK AND SEE WHETHER. THE AND I CAN. HARMS DID OCCUR. GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. THE SECOND PAPER WE WROTE WAS. HAD TO DO WITH THE CON. IF I MAY EARLIER IN SOME STATES HAVE GONE FOR IN A BEAR ANTI COMPETITIVE. WITH REESE TO MOST FAVORED NATIONS IS ONE. AND IT A PORTENT DOT POSSIBLE IS SB NINE SEVENTY SEVEN WHICH WAS CONSIDERED BY THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE LAST YEAR. WHICH REALLY WOULD PUT IN PLACE AUTHORITY OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. TO TAKE A HARD LOOK AT THESE CONTRACTS RANGING FROM THE ONES I LISTED EARLIER INCLUDING. AS WELL EXCLUSIVE DEALING AND TO SAY WHEN A DOMINANT HOSPITAL PUTS THOSE IN PLACE. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OR TO TAKE A HARD LOOK AT THEM AND SEE IF THEY ARE INDEED ANTI COMPETITIVE AND HAVE THE BENEFIT OF ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW OF THEM- SO THERE IS A STRONG ARGUMENT FOR- THE KIND OF. AUTHORITY THAT SB NINE SEVENTY SEVEN WOULD PUT IN PLACE- ANTI TRUST LITIGATION AS I DISCUSSED IS IMPORTANT IT'S IT PLAYS A ROLE BUT AS I SAID IT'S CERTAINLY NOT ENOUGH TO TAKE CARE OF THE- THE PROBLEM I LISTED SOME OF THE SUCCESSFUL CASES THE GOVERNMENT IS BROUGHT. THERE'S ANOTHER POSSIBILITY IT THAT'S GIVING THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE AUTHORITY TO REVIEW THESE PROVIDER CONTRACTS. THIS IS A SOMEWHAT AKIN TO WHAT'S BEING DONE IN RHODE ISLAND. THE STATE ATTORNEY THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE CAN TAKE A LOOK AT CONTRACTS AND SAY. YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT GONNA APPROVE YOUR CONTRACT IF THE PROVIDER- CLAUSES. ARE OF THE ANTI COMPETITIVE TYPE I'D LOOKED AT OR SIMPLY TO. YOU'RE PAYING MUCH THIS WOULD STRENGTHEN THE ABILITY OF THE INSURER TO BARGAIN EFFECTIVELY- YOU COULD GO FURTHER YOU COULD HAVE RATE CAPS ON A DOMINANT PROVIDERS AND THEIR OTHER. REGULATORY TOOLS OUT THERE THAT SOME STATES ARE FOOLING AROUND WITH SOME OF WHICH I DON'T THINK OUR GREAT IDEA THERE'S ONE CALLED. THE CERTIFICATE OF PUBLIC THE- REGULATION. WHICH WOULD CREE ANOTHER A- LIKE A SORE. OF NEED AGE AND I THINK THERE PROBLEM WITH THAT. AND FINALLY YOU COULD GO FOR EVEN FURTHER AND HAVE PAYER RIGHT. IT'S ARE. COMING OUT THE NEXT LIFE. I JUST WANTED TO A WITH THE SNAP OF WHERE ISLAND SITS THAT THAT'S ONE THAT'S OF INTERESTED ME AND I THERE ARE A LOT OF POLICY PEOPLE AT IT. TO UP IN POWER THE STATE ATTORNEY. THAT SORRY THE STATE. OF INSURANCE. TO DISAPPROVE PLAN RATES. BASED ON AFFORDABILITY AND THAT BATES CALLED THEIR AFFORDABILITY LOSS SO IT REALLY IS FOCUSING ON. ARE THE CONTRACTS THAT THE- HOSPITALS ARE ENTERING INTO WITH THE PAYERS. ARE THEY REALLY DRIVING THE HIGHER COSTS AS- THE OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE SEEMS TO. TO BE. THE CASE. AND THIS LAW ACTUALLY- DID SEVERAL INTERESTING THINGS BE IT REQUIRED- IF REQUIRED INSURERS TO INCREASE HOW MUCH WAS BEING PAID OUT FOR PRIMARY CARE. SHE WAS TRYING TO READ BALANCE THE- THE PAYMENT LEVEL WITH TOO MUCH MONEY GOING TO- TO SPECIALTY CARE NOT ENOUGH TO PRIMARY CARE. BECAUSE THERE IS JUST TO PUT IT BLUNTLY MORE BANG FOR YOUR BUCK IN PRIMARY CARE. ED AYE AYES AYE BUT I JUST MENTIONED HERE COULD BE. TO PUT IN GREAT REGULATION OF CERTAIN SO CERTAIN KIND. SUCH AS SETTING MAXIMUM REIMBURSEMENT RATES AS A PERCENTAGE OF MEDICARE. AND REQUIRE VALUE BASED PAYMENTS SO THERE ARE A LOT OF REGULATORY OPTIONS OUT THERE. AND I UNDERSTAND THE COMMITTEE'S GOING TO HOLD SOME HEARINGS- IN IN THE COMING MONTHS ABOUT THEMSELVES. YOU KNOW THE THOSE OF US WORKING THIS AT THAT THAT HASTINGS HAD BERKELEY WERE BE HAPPY TO. PARTICIPATE. ONE MORE SLOW. SO HE MY TAKE A THE WE HAVE HIGH KERR. RESULTS IN HIGHER PER PRICE THAT'S VERY WELL. THOSE HIGHER PROVIDER RESULTING HIGHER PREMIUMS AND THE DOCTOR AND HAD AFFECT AT. ALL OF WHICH RESULTS IN UNDER INSURANCE AND ON INSURANCE- OF ANY TRUST OVERSIGHT IS NECESSARY BUT NOT SUFFICIENT WE OUGHT TO ENCOURAGE AND EMPOWER THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO THE EXTENT WE CAN BUT IT DOESN'T DO THAT MUCH ABOUT EXISTING CONCENTRATION THAT'S WHERE THE POWER IS AND THAT'S WHERE THE COSTS ARE BEING DRIVEN. WE HAVE SOME LEGISLATIVE OPTIONS THAT I'VE I'VE DISCUSSED VERY BRIEFLY WHETHER THEY BE PROHIBITING THE CONTRACT TERMS ARE PUTTING IN PROVIDER RATE CAPS PUTTING IN MAXIMUMS. OF EMPOWERING THE INSURANCE DEPARTMENT TO DO SOME OF THAT OVERSIGHT OR EMPOWERING THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO HAVE AUTHORITY TO TAKE A LOOK AND BRING BRING CASES. ON ONE MORE SLIDE PLEASE. I KNOW THERE'S BEEN SOME DISCUSSION TODAY AND I KNOW MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE ARE VERY INTERESTED IN THE- IN THE- RURAL MARKETS OF WHAT. WHAT THE SITUATION IS FOR WORLD MARKETS. M. CALIFORNIA IS VIA JUSTICE WONDERFULLY I MOVED HERE THREE YEARS AGO FROM MISSOURI AND IT'S AND IT'S HEAVEN ON EARTH I'LL GIVE YOU GIVE YOU THAT BUT IT'S A VERY DIVERSE STATE. AND YOU HAVE SO MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF. COMMUNE AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AROUND THE STATE LET'S GO ONE MORE SLIDE WE LOOK AT CONCENTRATION. WE SEE A REAL VARIETY IN. HOW MUCH CONCENTRATION THERE IS BY MARKET. AND THIS WAS JUST A LIST THAT THE PEOPLE OF PETROUS PUT TOGETHER- UP COMPARING ALL THE DIFFERENT COUNTIES BY THE HER FOR DAHLE INDEX. I REMEMBER. TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED IS HIGHLY CONCENTRATED AND WHEN YOU GET DOWN TO THE EIGHT THOUSAND AND EIGHTY. THREE HUNDRED YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ONE HOSPITAL. COUNTIES SO. THE ISSUE HERE IS. ARE THERE ISSUES THAT ARE PECULIAR TO RURAL COUNTIES THAT HAVE TO BE SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSED BECAUSE IN SOME CASES THEY ARE WHAT THEY CALL THE ACTUAL MONOPOLIES THERE ARE GOING TO BE MULTIPLE HOSPITALS IN THOSE TOWNS AND ARE THERE IT REGULATORY OR OTHER MEANS TO. A FIGURE OUT WHETHER THERE IS EXCESSIVE PRICING BECAUSE THEY MAY HAVE HIGHER COSTS- DIFFERENTIALS AND SECONDLY IF THERE IF THERE ARE THOSE MECHANISMS HOW COULD THEY BE EFFECTIVELY DEPLOYED AND TO GO AFTER THE PROBLEM AREAS TO NOT HURT THOSE PERFORMING WELL AND JUST A COUPLE THINGS I WANT TO MENTION TO THE TO THE TO THE COMMITTEE- YOU KNOW ONE OF THE REALLYINTERESTING THINGS THAT'S BEEN GOING ON OBVIOUSLY. WITH COVE IT HAS BEEN THE RELIEF THAT WAS THAT WAS- PARCELED. OUT BY THE GOVERNMENT THE CARES ACT. THIS A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE. BILLION WITH A B. DOLLARS TO CALIFORNIA. HOSPITALS AND PROVIDERS- THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY AND THE QUESTION IS WHERE DID IT GO WELL THE AGAIN THIS THE A STUDY DONE BY BY THE PETROUS CENTER- RACING REALLY SEVERE QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT BECAUSE IT APPEARS. A LOT OF THAT MONEY WENT TO THE- THE HOSPITALS THAT ARE DOMINANT THE HOSPITALS THAT HAVE. A LOT OF MONEY IN THE BANK IN FACT- THE WRITERS OF THAT REPORT SUGGESTED- THE WAY THE MONEY WAS ALLOCATED WENT. ON THE BASIS OF PATIENT REVENUE FROM PRIVATE INSURERS PER HOSPITAL WELL THE BIG. HEALTHY HOSPITALS HAVE A LOT OF MONEY FROM PRIVATE INSURERS MANY OF THE RURAL AND SMALLER HOSPITALS DO NOT. IN THE MONEY WENT- IN A HIGHER PROPORTION AND AT LEAST THE AUTHORS OF THAT STUDY SUGGESTS THAT THE- THE FACT THAT HIGHLY CONCENTRATED MARKET HOSPITALS ARE ABLE TO. EXTRACT HIGHER PRICES AND THOSE HIGHER PRICES TURNING TO HIRE. CARES ACT RELIEF- IS REALLY PROBLEMATIC SO I THINK WE OUGHT TO TAKE A LOOK AT JUST WHERE THE MONEY WENT TO WHETHER WHETHER SOME OF THAT. EXCESS RELIEF- OR TO BE RE EXAMINED- THERE ARE A NUMBER OF INTERESTING- ANECDOTES OUT THERE IN THE NEW YORK TIMES RUN ARTICLES. SHOWING THAT HOSP WOULD LITERALLY. OF CASH IN THE BANK. RECEIVED A LOT OF KERR'S. SO THAT CERTAINLY SOMETHING TO LOOK AT AS WELL AS TAKING A HARD LOOK AT JUST WHAT THE COST AND- EXPENSE SITUATION. IS FOR THE RURAL HOSPITALS. WE I THINK. I THINK OUR GOING TO CLOSE PRETTY SOON TO BUT I A CERTAIN APPRECIATE THE OPERA SO IF YOU WANT TO. ASACOL BE HAPPY TO ADDRESS THE FOUR FIVE ONE MORE OF IN MY TO SO I SAW THAT'S IN ON. THE NICER DARK SO THERE WE GO. SO I JUST WANT SAFE YOU FOR THE- AND- THE WAY YOU HAVE. DID I IT'S REALLY VALUE TO US AS A AS WE LOOK LOOK TO THE FUTURE. AND OBVIOUSLY.

THANK YOU CHAIR WOODEN MEMBERS BARBARA GLAZER WITH A CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION AS THE COLOR CALIFORNIA'S HEALTHCARE SYSTEM HOSPITAL A CRITICAL ROLE IN MAKING HEALTH CARE MORE AFFORDABLE FOR CONSUMERS. A LITTLE KNOW THAT THE SYSTEM IN ITS CURRENT FORM CAN BE IMPROVED BILLING IS COMPLICATED PLANTS ARE DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE AND THERE ARE BARRIERS IN ACCESS TO CARE ESPECIALLY FOR SPECIALTY SERVICES. WHICH REQUIRING THE SYSTEM EVERY CALIFORNIAN HAS ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY AFFORDABLE CARE IS A PRIORITY FOR HOSPITALS AND SHOULD BE A PRIORITY FOR OUR ENTIRE. HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. I LITTLE SUPPORT THE CONCEPT OF IT INTO ANALYSIS EXPERT REVIEW AND MONITOR AND HELP CARE COSTS TREND. RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD CONSIDER METHODS TO MODERATE THE RATE OF GROWTH IN HEALTHCARE SPENDING AND ENCOURAGE INNOVATION. SH THIRD DOUBLE PRACTICAL ACHIEVABLE STEPS TAKEN DIRECTLY REDUCE THE RATE OF GROWTH IN HEALTHCARE SPENDING FOR CONSUMERS INCLUDING EXPAND OUR CURRENT EFFORTS TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF CALIFORNIANS WITHOUT HEALTH INSURANCE. REDUCE THE FINANCIAL BURDEN ABOUT FADED OR ANOTHER VERY REGULATION. MANY OF THE REGULATIONS FOR THE LICENSING AND CERTIFICATION OF HEALTH CARE FACILITIES AND OTHER PROVIDERS NO LONGER ALIGNED WITH TODAY'S CHANGING HEALTH CARE ENVIRONMENT. YET STILL ACCOUNT FOR A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF PRODUCT WITHIN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. THANK MAKE REGULATIONS ALONE ARE ESTIMATED TO COST MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED BILLION AND EXPENSE THAT WILL BE BORNE BY HEALTHCARE CONSUMER. ENCOURAGE INNOVATION AND FOCUS ON REFORMING THE CURRENT HEALTHCARE REIMBURSEMENT FRAMEWORK THE FAILED TO HELP PROTECT COSTS WITHIN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. THE LAST AS WE CONSIDER LET.

WE MUCH APPRECIATE YOU HOLDING THIS IMPORTANT HEARING ON CONTROLLING THE COST OF HEALTHCARE IN CALIFORNIA.

IN PARTICULAR LOW WAGE WORKERS ARE PREDOMINANTLY WORKERS OF COLOR FIND THEMSELVES FOR GOING HEALTH CARE BECAUSE THEY CANNOT AFFORD IT EVEN WHEN THEY HAVE COVERAGE THE SKYROCKETING HEALTH CARE COSTS ALSO THREATENED EFFORTS TO ATTAIN UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE COVERAGE IN CALIFORNIA. IN CONSIDERING THE OPTIONS WE HAVE MOVING FORWARD WELL WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE AND HAVE ARE PARTICIPATED IN EFFORTS TOWARDS GREATER TRANSPARENCY TRANSPARENCY. BE THE GOAL ITSELF WE ALREADY KNOW THAT SOME HEALTH SYSTEMS ARE FAR MORE XPENSIVE THAN OTHERS. BUT THERE'S A LITTLE BIT LOW INCOME CONSUMERS CAN DO WITH THE FACT. THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH POWER INFORMATION ABOUT WHERE TO GET CARE NOR SHOULD THEY BEAR THE RESPONSIBILITY WHEN THEY'RE THE PLAYERS IN THE SYSTEM. WITH THE LEAST INFORMATION. ANY SOLUTION MUST ALSO INCORPORATE ACTUAL REGULATION AND OVERSIGHT THAT REQUIRES THE HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY TO DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY. FOR THIS REASON WE HAVE SUPPORTED SOLUTION BUT THE CREATION OF THE OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY AND LEGISLATION THAT WOULD CONTROL SURPRISE MEDICAL BILLS. AND HOPE TO SEE MORE SOLUTIONS LIKE THAT THAT WOULD REQUIRE REAL INDUSTRY CHANGE AND CONTROL HEALTHCARE PRICES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT NEXT CALLER PLEASE. NOT LINE THIRTY SEVEN I HAD.
