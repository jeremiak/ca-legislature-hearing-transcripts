of America. And to the Republic for which it stands one nation under god indivisible. Cristina. That on. Good afternoon thank you for coming assembly member autumn Burke and I represent the sixty second assembly district which includes Inglewood Hawthorne. Gardena Lennix west Athens marina Delray Venice. El Segundo to name a few. I'd think you for attending this year th of this year's first select committee hearing on career technical education and building a twenty first century workforce. I also and I think assembly member Sabrina Cervantes for hosting at this hearing and her assembly district and Marco community college for allowing us to use the space to have this important conversation. I have been a champion for CT on workforce development in the California State Legislature because I understand the role it plays. For people getting living wage jobs and for our economy to grow it in California. Workforce is important for every community in California and that's why we are here and thank you for being here for to have this conversation with us today. The intent of this hearing is to get a greater understanding of the need for CT and workforce development and to hear from the people who are the boots on the ground. And businesses who need a skilled trained workforce. This year I am proud to join the author AB seventeen forty three which is a bipartisan coalition of members to ensure that we continue funding. California's career technical and education incentive grant program at five hundred million every year for the next three years. We understand that these programs are more expensive so we need to invest the adequate funds of curriculum and tech techniques keep up as economy is changing so rapidly as you all know. We would be ill served if we created economy of those who have access to good paying jobs and those who do not. So we must ensure all Californians have the opportunity gain the skills necessary to obtain a job that provides a economic certainty and security for their families and we must support a strong and growing middle class. I wanna thank you in advance for your support on these issues I I see a lot of familiar faces here and some new one so we're happy to see you here. And now I will turn it over to assembly member Sabrina Cervantes for her opening remarks. Can everyone hear me excellent so again good afternoon I am assembly member Sabrina Cervantes representing the sixtieth assembly district. Aye and that encompasses it while the city of Norco the city of east a bill corona group of Valley. And portions of riverside forty percent of the city of riverside so thank you for being with us today and thank you for hosting the city of Norco Norco committee college for hosting us here. For today's discussion but before we dive into this I want to just think my colleague chair of the select committee assembly woman autumn Burke for coming to the district and. I seen the great opportunities and we have here right riverside county. I think you for your willingness to come here and share the your unique relationship aye with what you're doing and the LA county area. And of course we're going to hear a great testimony today from many of our leaders within the industry. In any case with that some of the challenges that we face I want to give you a snapshot. Of the Inland Empire in the sixtieth assembly district as a region in the Inland Empire. Our top industries I want to share with you are advance manufacturing global trade and logistics and the health care industry. Within. Evolving world of technology information and communication technology has been identified as one of the key emerging sectors of our time. The unemployment rate here in the sixtieth assembly district is out three point seven percent. Slightly less than the overall state average so how do we continue to promote these middle to high skilled occupations and how do we continue to educate the necessary work force it takes. To meet our industry needs. So hopefully we can get a little closer today and eh identifying some of this those solutions it's imperative that I recognize the wonderful collaboration. That we have between my office and of course the president at Norco college in this your and your entire team. I president Dr Reese. In the back thank you so much for your ongoing collaboration and truly I do we taking that extra step to. Turn Norco college into Aurora world renowned institution. Yeah dot three so please feel free to approach the podium to provide some welcoming remarks So thank you to both of you for having us here today job I'd like to make a few opening remarks and then turn it over to my colleagues here for us some similar remarks. I first of all I'd like to I think. Everybody for coming in welcome to the beautiful Norco college campus. Were happy to hold these events into please that. You enjoy coming effort for these hearings I think it's a it's a win win for for both of us. You know one of the things we talk a lot about in in higher ed is this idea of building pathways. It's been a a very very strong conversation going on in the community colleges and in our unified school districts. And when we think about building pathways or trying to do is create a very clear. Pathway of instruction for students so there so they understand exactly what courses they need to take. Courses they don't need to take. And provide all kinds of support around that pathway that helps keep students moving in a in a you know a productive direction. One of the big challenges in creating a successful pathway is getting to students to think early on. What the into that pathway looks like and that's where? Career education comes in. In my mind career education Creek technical education is not a program. It's a philosophical approach to to higher ed every single program that we offer on campus leads to some kind of career to leading in some direction. And it's. It's important that we get students to think about that I know I know are not all students are gonna know exactly what they want to do. You know I had. All kinds of crazy ideas when I was you know eighteen nineteen twenty years old that type thing but getting them to think along the lines of where this. This takes us is is really critical to our students having. A successful and transformational experience there a couple of things I'd like to encourage you to think about and I know there be more details in the room. As we go through the hearing. Up first of all the idea of guided pathways are I would like to encourage you to continue funding that program it's something that the entire board believes is having had a direct impact. It's something that's all three colleges are working on it something that corona Norco unified Albert unified who rip of al unified they're all we're all trying to build. A these pathways. A second thing of like you know a can continue supporting and think about is to enrollment. Are your colleagues in the unified school district that really thinking deliberately about programs. That lead students into careers. The technical careers in in in a professional careers. And they once I and I and I want to also build seamless pathways that move from unified school districts into the community colleges and into jobs or into the our community colleges and Anna into the universities. And this requires you know unified school this of several bureaucracy and we have our own bureaucracy in these of these have evolved over. Over decades and they don't just you know sync up release. So we we have to be very thoughtful about how we put these together so it's a a a seamless experience for students in the requires. A a great deal of time and energy and a little bit of funding. But I just to give you a quick sense of how valuable these are we are we have a program here at JFK where we have students in high school my transfer or they take college classes through dual enrollment. Bomb us last year we invested about two hundred and fifty thousand dollars in taxpayer money to put that connection together. And we saved families in the region about one point eight million dollars and educational cost because of the. The seamless are because we're able to offer this dual enrollment program. Other the third thing I'd like. To mention is a pretty ships this is a really impair important program. Aye norcal colleges on the front lines a of a pretty ships United courage you two are to continue supporting this was very important. That we get students early and are to jobs so they're able to to get a sense of how practical they're studying yes no it it adds meaning and value to their to their education. I'm gonna in my comments there and I'd like to. Turn it over to three my colleagues here. I'm not sure what order you guys wanna go in but I'm thinking we start with the president the school board. To receive a car is president of our. School border our board of trustees we also have Mister bell Hendrick he's our. One of our. Board members also and. Doctor Irving Hendrix is also here to represent RCC and the and the college so alternate overtop president. In this you here today on behalf of love my trustees Michael trustees I can tell you that the initiative around CT <u>&lt;c.green&gt;</u> probably one the for front ones that we play talk about the most. In making sure that we're identifying programs that bring a living wage. I am I have the great pleasure of not only serving the colleges a trustee on here in this region but I also work in the area of critical education. However twenty any unified school district in their I. M. the college careers and economic development director I bought some of our team with us from fontina we share a border with riverside. And is a partner in the region we are working on initiatives together collectively to identify how we work together seamlessly between all of our community colleges. That represent the system and how we were together is unified school district and so it's a pleasure to have you here were happy to host you and we hope that you'll come back and let us. Help you important would we network without in the turn over to my fellow trustee bill Hedrick. That some. A it is a. A pleasure to have you here today. I represent the communities of corona Norco any stale. But I want to applaud your vision and the vision of our president at Norco college. This is clearly an initiative that has the potential to change lives. And. So with that said. I know that of the work that you do is so important the work that doctor Reese and his team. Does to. Bring it to fruition on the ground is so important. We are so pleased. To have this. Hearing today and provide an opportunity for the Inland Empire to showcase the programs that we have thank you. On behalf of. Chancellor world OB <u>&lt;c.green&gt;</u> is in Coronado today attending to. Pathways models our for career technical education but also transfer. Which is a big part of. What you're about to and at the California assembly? I'm happy to welcome you on chancellor you socks of the half. Assembly member Burke thank you so much for traveling to our Norco today. A. Assembly member Cervantes is say a true friend of the riverside community college district. Of Norco college and a close colleague to assembly persons in this hour area as we are the. At Norco. We your in the gateway to the riverside community college district you travel east on the sixty freeway. You go south on the fifteen years ago. Aye east and south on the ninety one. Norco college is the gateway and the gateway I think to progress in career and technical education we. We treasure our Norco campus. The campus it riverside of course they're dating back to nineteen sixteen is the oldest in the most mature of the colleges in the riverside community college yet. District at yes but. President di. Here was that not even born in nineteen. Our. A sixteen so. We care deeply about our. Full employment but that's already happening so what the we're focusing now on in career technical education. Be at it riverside City College. Norco college where we are today are Marino valley college on sort of the eastern frontier of the district. Is zeroing in on living wage a jobs we're not fighting unemployment and a long their their play plenty of minimum wage jobs. But your the title of what you are about. Name way the. Our the nexus between education career readiness and work force development. Is what we'll be hearing about from our colleagues behind us today and now I'm looking forward to that person way on behalf of chancery sock. And the district of riverside community college thank you. Well I wanted to say thank you to our trustees and to doctor recent doctor Hendrik for party providing your remarks and look for to. Hide diving into this discussion and before we move on I do want and I just quickly high why we do have elected officials from. Almost each in my cities here as well as the school board members and so just thank you so much for being here and being a strong partner. High in this endeavor. But so thank you thank you all as you as you get up from the table and also I hope as I get older they just keep calling me more mature not old. I I'm going to remember that for a long time. And everything that you all are doing is exactly what what we hope to promote and the seamless pathways. For young people moving forward and for pressure programs are tremendously important and that's what we're here for today so with that we have one last housekeeping item. Should any member from the audience wish to sign up for public comment there's a sign up sheet at the back. Where is it in the back it's back in this corner over here and so now we will move into our first panel panelists please come up and he can? First up today we will have Jim mayor president and CEO of California forward. Thank you for being here gentlemen. Good afternoon chairman Burke and a member Cervantes thank you for your leadership thank you for the invitation to be here today my name is Jim bear on the presidency of California forward. California forward is the managing partner of the California economic summit which is a seven year project public private and Civic. To develop. And promote in advance a roadmap to shared prosperity to really. Get at the issue of economic insecurity upward mobility. And develop the comprehensive plan and the policies and practices that would move the needle on those issues. Were of region's based effort and an example that region's based effort is a Pagani other presidency of the Inland Empire economic partnership here is a been a strong and long partnering co chair the summit's during committee in a number members and it's. Also this partnership with. All kinds of government agencies in particular community colleges Eli Oakley when he was. Superintendent at Long Beach City College was the co chair of the summit in has been deeply involved in our work. That we all can I think stipulate that while we have cortical full economy a full employment or near full employment we've got a whole lot of work to do. Until we can address the poverty issues in the income inequality issues in California and one of the roles of the summit is to build understanding and awareness of how big that problem is what the dimensions are what we can do about it and so. Some of what we do is publish things like the California elevate California index and it helps keep all of us focused on just some of the issues. So let me just cite a couple of them of the items from that index in nineteen seventy five when I was a junior in high school twenty five percent of the young men ages twenty five to thirty four. Got paid thirty thousand dollars or less. Today holding those dollars constant forty one percent of men in that age group make thirty thousand dollars or less and seventy five dollars. That's a huge erosion of our middle class. Five million Californians have minimum wage workers according to the LA Joh and according to the LA a thirty two percent of those employers are the only. Wage earner in their family they may be the only person in their family but and there that they're the only wage earner. And there seven hundred disconnected youth and the state of California sixteen to twenty four who are at school. Or employ. I'm so we're not at full employment and we've got a big way to go if what we want to do is address these. One of the things the summit is doing in this next year is trying to promote the idea of putting in state law. Metrics and targets for addressing these issues of income inequality in upper mobility. We've seen the power of the efforts to curb greenhouse gases in California where we set a goal we set a target we unleash the power of the public and private sector to. To move toward that end and if we're serious and we are about addressing these issues we should do the same for. For unemployment and we should do the same for income inequality would do should do the same for reducing poverty and. Member Burke we look forward to working with you on the AB fifteen twenty task force denigrate some of those metrics and the good work that's already under way to develop similar metrics for. Children and family and poverty. And now that it's important for us to recognize even as we continue to focus on this imperative of workforce development that it's it's part of a system it is only one part the system that's gonna be necessary for those California's to reach those goals. And if you look at the roadmap for sure prosperity there's a lot and there are and what we need to do in order to build houses a to build community development and in particular and housing. It should be noted that that the housing crisis is growing much faster than wages. And Wilk in will continue to a road. The middle class economic security if if we don't do something about housing two years ago mackenzie on behalf of California for the summit did a study that showed that California's pay at least at least their low estimate fifty billion dollars a year more for housing than they should. And those are by low income families and that money should be spent on education it should be spent on their own retirement it should be spent on other. Necessities so you we have to remember the relationship between what you're working on today and all the other things that you work so hard on Sacramento when we do in the rear. And there's also another thing we need to focus on and that is that. By an estimate done for the summit by Stanford University were short nine hundred thousand median wage jobs if the metric was one median wage job for every household. So we actually need to be worried about it thinking about what the business climate is and what the strategies are for growing the right kinds of jobs in our regions throughout the state. Now finally the third part is this human development and workforce development has been a key element from the summit since day one. That our partners in the summit Bammer have been very involved in the development of the strong workforce program where involved in the task force we did regional meetings. To help bring invoices from six from students from disadvantaged communities and from the employment community so that the recommendations that move forward to the governor in the legislature incorporated some of those voices we've been involved in directly. Implementing the strong workforce program not because it's an answer but because it's an example of how we can do it needs to get done to make best use of available resources. To get students from where they are to employment and what they've trained for on an upper mobility track. From the work over the last few years I think there's for lessons that we can draw that are part of our prescription going forward for all of our human development and workforce development work. The first is we we absolutely need to continue to make progress in this alignment. Between where students are and what skills they have and and and not just. Classes but programs and curriculum that will prepare them. For industry valued credentials and other industry valued milestones that lead to employment. And in that there's still work to be done there and some of the topic in testimony today here is about how to get that align. The second is we just need to be ruthless about efficiency and this isn't from a business standpoint of squeezing out every time. The reality is the faster students can move from where they are to that living wage job. We're gonna save a lot of money and most of that money is theirs most of that money is money that that they lose because they are not employed in those jobs whether spending too long getting through that pipeline. And so we have to continue to find ways about. How to accelerate that not so that it is superficial so it's meaningful so get some where they have to be but we have to recognize that the cost of that inefficiency is mostly born by the young people in a better job? A third is we need to redefine access we are proud and we should be proud in the state of California for defining open access particularly community colleges. Around fees and and the ability to get and the ability to keep taking classes are to start and stop I'm a product of that system I have in a from a community college. But it's about much more than that because access now is not just about getting in the door not being fees it's about offering what's needed when it's needed and where it's needed. And we need to embrace a variety of ways to do that including technologies that are not only going to allow us to. Do things like on offer online classes but offer a but to infuse faster competency based classes and a start and and and then the link up especially with employers and this is another part of your. Somatic element today so. It's really clear not only today but especially going forward. That we're gonna have to find a way to double down and build even deeper. Employer educational partnerships going forward McKenzie did another study last year not for the summit that just as useful that says and by twenty thirty fifteen percent of the jobs will be replaced or obsolete because of machine learning or automation artificial intelligence fifteen percent of the jobs. So we're faced with this dilemma that right now we've got a whole lot of people that need the skills in order to get better jobs. And at the same time were worried about what those jobs but with which jobs are gonna disappear and what we need to do to prepare those people for it. We don't know the answers to all of those questions but we do know we can build an infrastructure. That allows for greater access greater efficiency greater adaptability and working with partnerships with employers to understand where those dislocation changes are gonna happen before the pink slips come out and people can get para to take those jobs. One final word. And this comes back to another thread this come through the summit from mark Bassano the former executive officer of the southern California association a governor of. Governments now USCS a longtime member the summit network recently wrote a book and much after it says no once disposable. Because of the demographic trends become because all of us baby boomers are going to retire and in the work force behind us isn't as large. And we actually gonna need everybody engaged and in our economy if we want our economy to grow and we want to meet the basic workforce needs it's not just about skills it's about the skills for everybody who's in that workforce. As I mentioned we've got seven hundred thousand disconnected you we've also got five hundred thousand mostly men but men and women who are in our criminal justice system in prison in jail on probation or parole. There are hundreds of thousands of others that are formally incarcerated not on the systems but still face barriers to employment. Those are examples about how we have to find everybody in our community and create a pathway the president re said to get them into full employment that's our challenge I think we're up to it thank you for the opportunity to give you some reflections. Thank you Jim next step is Lauren que president of California foundation for commerce and education. But. Thank you assembly member. Cervantes sins of. Chairman of Burke a very pleased to be here Marin que was California foundation for commerce and education were the. Nonprofit think tank affiliated with California chamber of commerce. We do research and policy studies we also. Are the lead on some. Local employer partnerships on work based learning which I'll talk about the few minutes. Very pleased to have been invited to. Address you today and have the. Excuse in the pleasure to come don't Norco in the. Find community culture. Now. Given your position on this committee your. Probably as familiar more familiar than I am of the work force challenges but I want to. Put it in the context of an. Of an employer. A and what what employers are are facing and all of a quote from a. Robert Klein hands of beacon economics in he said very well he said with the stated full employment. Our and your your you mention your district being a three point seven percent. Of unemployment. A job growth in general economic gains will largely be constrained by the availability of of workers is is good for workers who might achieve. Pay increases in the coming months supporters but poses a challenge for firms for businesses that want to grow but cannot. Because they're unable to hire the necessary workers. Data at the national level indicates the job openings in general have reached historic highs is holds true for most industries whether they're high school. A low skilled. Manufacturing of those services. Of. Its it so prevalent throughout the condom history hearing California nationally fifty percent of open available positions in this country. Go unfilled. Because candidates are available at the same time forty percent of businesses can't take on more work because they can't fill the jobs that they need to do the work. So we've got a real mismatch. Between our talent needs in the pipeline of new and potential workers in this this gets into what Jim was talking about with the retirement. Of the baby boom generation of. Our population cohorts coming in behind them were. You know we don't have the robust immigration we've had in the in the past is a whole lot of things that enter into this but. You still result with the same problem. Of low unemployment but. The. Less of an opportunity for businesses and the economy to grow so we've out what the six seventh eighth largest economy in the world. But we need to have a produce another. Of what one point one million jobs of of a. College degrees of three twenty thirty in order to keep that economy. Does that economy going out and the reality is even. For this for for the students it is Saddam. How is difficult and that's real also ran into a mismatch only forty percent of the state's? Two point two million young adults that so. Through a about age thirty. Holden associates degree or higher in many lack the skills for for success it's even worse for underrepresented students less than ten percent. Of low income adults. Or the post secondary degree. And you've got similar gaps entertainment for. Of students of color in the state where fifty five percent. A public school students are from low income families sixty percent. Students of color. The educational and career outcomes are inextricably linked to the economy and vice versa were all in this together. So. Would we want to do about. There's lots of strategies in her about a lot of today the one that I want to. Plug in particular. As called link learning and you may you may have you may have heard of this I know that. Some schools in your districts of. Bob are linked learning schools are about a hundred districts statewide the do it but I want to. Just go into a little bit and tell you why we like. Ugh that we think that it has the best prospect for providing a long term pipeline of well qualified students will meet the needs of. That the needs of employers and of the economy. And enabling these. High school graduates college grads to stay in Californian jobs. Pay well and it of god the prospect for upward mobility. Basic philosophy behind link learning. Is the idea the students work harder and dream Baker. If there education is relevant to them. The approach integrates rigorous academics the beach meet college ready standards. Sequenced high quality career technical education work based learning. And the supporting environment help students stay on track so. Four components rigorous academics. Career technical education work based learning comprehensive support services so why focus on both. Career in college we hear a lot about well. You know as a but just there's a whole bunch of jobs a don't need a four year college education a. Whole bunch of. Students who don't go to college why don't why should we focus on. Being college ready well. Couple reasons one is the probability of making a living wage. In our economy special in California. Without some form of post secondary education is low and it's only gonna diminish. Increasingly career success depends on some kind of a post secondary degree your credential whether it's a certificate and apprenticeship. On associates degree though those are all things that are provide right here at at at Norco. Or. About shoes degree or or or something higher. Secondly. Without an explicit goal. For preparing high school students for a full range post graduation opportunities. You risk. Reverting to tracking students. Tracking students entered into choices that an adult thinks. Is right for that student and an adult may decide whether a student is ready for college and we just want to go back there thing that's. That's a. That's a placer we we we don't want to return to. So in addition a rigorous academics each pathway centers on increase student proficiency in areas such as. Critical thinking problem solving. Information literacy collaboration these of the soft skills you hear about the boy would be to say they are really really important. Once you get into the once again of the work place. Not speaking of workplace accord part of. The learning experience and Winkler inning is work based learning. This is where. Students can apply their classroom learning. In a professional setting and gain the real world experience in the process they learn what it takes to being in the professional world. And they learn how to interact with people. On the job the other not necessarily working these can be job shadowing mentor ships. Speakers. Arm or our actual actual internships. Are but it's all part of a of a vote. Link learning experience the become more engaged excited about their education. And they can. Really answer and an intuitive level. Why do I need to learn what it is I'm learning in the classroom? So what's our role in this. A. There's. Unfortunately. In under engagement by California employers in providing workplace experiences for youth despite the really strong business case for. Of for making this happen it's a lot easier. To grow work. That is becoming familiar with you rather than going out trying to recruit it specially across state lines. US so we are of working with link learning alliance. With the U. S. chamber of commerce. And other entities to develop networks in California of local chambers of the working with their members. To. Build different kinds of work based learning models at their employers are. Can use of we've been doing this for the last several years. This year on please to say that were. Just starting up a new network with a six local chambers of commerce that are involved in this. I including the riverside. Chamber of commerce in the Los Angeles. Chamber of commerce of. Of. Two two of the six and will be you are working to develop different models for work basin. Learning for engagement between employers and school districts to expose their their students to this and. Of all be pleased to report. To you later on how that works out and I would invite you to visit your school districts that are have linked learning. Programs and with the chambers that are involved in that thank you. And now up is my good friend Jan vocal executive director and CEO of South Bay workforce investment board. Now yes. Thank you and thank you for your leadership and inviting me to this a hearing today and and assembly member Cervantes also. Some of what I was gonna say was already said by. The gentleman that to my right side I want to repeat that. So I'm just gonna go quickly here. This out the boards. The work force boards are the entity is the is the entity that can connect. Chambers and the businesses to the education partners that's what we do that's what we're here for. If we wanna get the most out of those courses that are being taught to as particularly the underserved population. And the businesses that know what they need. It's the boards that can help them directly it could be the link and we are the glue in our community to be able to do that. South Bay private SLP workforce investment board serves eleven cities and South Bay area many of those cities are assembly members Burke. And. Of what we do are basically get people jobs and help business that's it that's all we want to do how do we do that well a lot of the work force development education. That we do happen to do a host industry sector meetings develop pre apprenticeship programs now apprenticeship programs provide the paid internships in the paid work experience to those individuals we also have a directory of schools in our area. That directly to schools list. Education entities are going to live to it lead to a job it doesn't lead to a job they're not going to be in our directory. Almost all the boards in the LA basin and an Orange County use our directory wide of the user directory because if you stay on our directory they know that the results are going to be a job if it's not a job. Those schools come offered them off the directory and in our area sixteen community colleges are listed. On our directory and and hundreds of our courses are listed so the community colleges are doing quite well. And doing better and better. With the partnerships in being able to lead to jobs. Some of the areas where we partner with community colleges and educational institutions we have a work study program. The work study program. Is funded partly by LA county department of public social service. A community colleges a dozen community colleges in the LA county area. Are individuals that are on ten if they're going to community colleges a community colleges place them on work sites the begin work experience we pay those students well right actually we pay fifty percent. And the community colleges pay fifty percent the great partnership partnership between education. And department of the social service and it works. One of the programs we have you gonna be you're going to be looking at. Various. Job readiness programs in a little while but we have a job readiness program called blueprint for workplace success. Individuals that go through that curriculum by thirty our curriculum sometimes twenty. They end up with a hot much higher probability getting employed we teach them not only how to get a job how to keep a job. Books are available it's also taught online the colleges that use it love it. Career pathways career pathways you heard a lot about repair fleas. We partner with the K. twelve schools we partner with the community colleges. We partner with. Various organizations and provide workplace activities and. Provide guest speakers job shadowing pre apprenticeship deal with lots of different school districts and tell consortium is one of the programs. That were a partner and. There are five colleges that partner with us six intermediaries for of those intermediaries our work for sports. Fourteen school districts it's for engineering and manufacturing that's what the school districts are centering on and that's what we're doing linking them in link learning linking them to opportunity so that they can succeed. One program which is a great example of a partnership. Would be our slingshot nursing program we brought all of our hospitals into one room and we said what do you need what can we do to help you. They said we need case coordinators case managers is various names for it they said that's what's going to be the demand in the next five years. So that's what we did we brought the community colleges and we said we need a curriculum curriculums been developed. But a million dollars the state provided order provide this and starting this month. The first group of case coordinators are gonna be trained through our. Community colleges primarily and we're going to have. Incumbent workers getting retrained and upgraded to. Supplement their nursing skills would case coordination individuals coming out of college getting this starting this month we're really proud of that initiative took about three years to get going wouldn't of happened without the businesses in the room. Telling us what they need. We have another program locally called Errol flex Affleck's program couldn't be more proud of this program. It is it started out as a pre apprenticeship era era flicks program for engineering students. And putting them in. Various aerospace companies learning. How to be an engineer what they want to do go to college keep a end clued in their education so that they can? Of become successful last week we were notified by the federal department of labor. That we were granted. Status as the first apprenticeship program for and aerospace engineers in the country so that's an out growth of this pre apprenticeship program. Real. Real happy about that so we're gonna be taking high school kids. Community college individuals college individuals incumbent workers and making sure that they succeeded increase their potential. That's what boards. Do many of them doing should do is be the glue we don't teach the engineering the schools teach the engineering but we made it happen. And we're real proud of that. Era flicks program it's it's it's overlaying the traditional education systems. Putting on top of that an apprenticeship programs so we designed this apprenticeship program so that the employers tell us. What the students need to be successful and then we bring in the proper educational components to make sure that success now we're designing other apprenticeship programs? Using the template of the aerospace engineering program it's terrific some of the other innovative programs that were doing that are connected to education. Were about to start the uniquely able project in which were taking high performing. Autistic individuals and training them to be CNC machine es we have the employers lined up we have the community college lineup is going to do the training and they're going to be placed. In businesses because of this unique partnership. With they with some of our community colleges were also taking graduates who have disabilities. And we're gonna be placing them in various businesses that are already lined up we couldn't of done it without this community colleges but they couldn't of done it without us. Because the community colleges they don't have to keep developing different. Employer partnerships. That's what we do they should use us to be able to do that and leverage our funds. And funds we needs of huts we had about fifty percent cut in funds the last ten years. For what we do and it for WYO a which is our core funding. We we were able to spend seventy percent of those funds on in school youth in the pass for a youth program. Now we can only spend twenty five percent on in school youth. Well we love and school you've we're not gonna not serve in school use but obviously we need money we need partnerships were working with community colleges. They're. Where we're grateful that some of them are providing strong workforce money to us to be able to do that? But unless we're able to partner on those they could get some funds for that. We can't do what we do best. Lots of different programs the promise program promise programs throughout California now we've been doing it for years. Where the with the kids are getting paid a tuition and books for the first year we're taking them to community colleges and four year colleges putting them up in dorms? Little kids faith great kids we put him up the doors of the Vic the experience of what college is like. That's a partnership we put all the chambers of commerce together one day. With all of our cities and economic development directors they've never even met before and we said what do you need what do you want us to do. They gave us a list we did it. Exceeding. Okay I'm gonna hurry up here when I let when a to two meetings that had recently I left the meeting this morning when I came over here. In the room was the department of rehabilitation in our area. A parole department. And the work for sport. We're gonna take and it's happening now were taken and parolees who need a job desperately. Structured work is is abundant. They're eligible to work those construction jobs seventy or eighty percent are eligible for rehabilitation. So we want to get money from department a rehabilitation which they have. And put them in this construction jobs. That's starting to work it's going to work it's going to be a great partnership last week we had a youth council meeting we meet every quarter our board. I looked around the room we had seven. Superintendents from school districts a community college president. A representative from a four year college and a region occupation superintendent in the same room. And one of the superintendents Tami and announced to the to the group I've been doing this for three years. This is the meeting that I get the most out of. One of our superintendents as a trustee in Inglewood was our first meeting. She said she was overwhelmed getting those people together that's what boards do they're the glue. We need to be used to be able to accomplish what you need to accomplish and we love our. Business partners and our education partners thank you. Thank you now our final panelist Jim Miller Dada chair riverside county workforce investment board. Thank you assembly member. A Burke assembly member. A Cervantes for coming out. Turn it on sorry. Thank you for. Allowing me to speak aye aye I would. Agree with Jan. And I should say that I've known John for twenty five years he's a close friend and he's been one of my mentors. I've learned a lot from him so if I say anything you don't like. We're going to blame blame Janet. So you might get of you might get a slightly different perspective from me. Because. I I think I'm a little bit different than all the speakers you heard from because. I'm a business leader and this is a volunteer job for me but I love doing this stuff. So I've been a member. And in the workforce system I been doing this for. Almost twenty five years. I'm the chair of this County Board. I have. Been on the California workforce board for fourteen years so work very closely with David Lanier Mike Rossi. And I'm a past chair of the California workforce board. And also said on the and by the way I'm on the executive committee there and I also sit on the national workforce board I work with the federal department of labor. And I frequently testified before congressional committees in Washington DC so I'm gonna just give you a. Slightly different perspective from an employer. From a business side. And and Jan is right aye I speak all over the country and people ask me all the time will how many jobs did you workforce board create. The workforce for does not create jobs the workforce would break basically is like the quarterback in any community and as you know California has forty seven work for sports. And whenever I'm in Washington I was remind legislators that even though we're one of fifty states one out of every eight people in the country. Lives in California. Somebody wants to listen everybody's interested. But we connect the people we have. Business leaders labor education nonprofits government. And we train workers we help dislocated workers and all the forty seven work for sports actually all five hundred fifty of the work force boards that are funded by Congress. Also run youth opportunity centers. And and in the Inland Empire. We have a total of eleven Butte centers with almost two thousand disconnected youth between the ages of sixteen and twenty four. That all success stories once they've gotten enrolled in our system. So you've heard a lot of numbers and most of the stuff that I would like to talk about already been said so but. Maybe I can just give you a slightly different spin. The. College graduates are amazing right for your university the graduate. They can't find a job. We have employers call are America's job centers everyday. Then ask for a certain. Type criteria of workforce. We don't have those so. When I talk about it it sounds a little weird you know you us assembly member Cervantes mentioned our unemployment is down to three point seven which is. Almost considered full employment full employment. But yet there's so many jobs looking for people. We can't provide them and everybody talks about there's a shortage of high skilled workers that the shortage of high skilled workers there is. But for us in the Inland Empire there is a shortage of middle skilled workers you know if they're the forgotten middle because we don't really have a lot of high skilled companies that are looking for. Big time the majority of the folks. The in California even that need to find jobs a middle skilled workers we've just got to find a better way. To do that now of this gentleman mentioned. The four year universities and I hope there's nobody here representing a four year university because I don't offend anybody. I have. To millennials at home and they did both both go to four year universities but everybody doesn't need to go to four year university so many other. Students that come out of four year universities have these huge debts and then they can't find a job. So I wanna references survey nine years ago when we had the mortgage meltdown the national workforce board did a survey a national survey around the country. And they ask employers if you have a college graduate looking for a job posting you have and you have a sixty five year old older worker because that was the time when everybody's for one case were decimated and a lot of older workers. Wanted to stay. So we asked them who would you hire and seventy five percent of them said of course we would hire the college graduate because there are you know more passion that they have. They're more they know more stuff. Last year we did the same survey at seventy five percent of them said well heart of the older workers. Because the younger people nowadays. And I think part of this is because we decimated the ROP programs from the schools. When I was going to high school eighty three percent of the students in high school had some connection to business. Now we did the state board did some numbers two years ago and less than ten percent of the students in high schools of any connection to business. So when they graduate and when they go for a job interview. They're never St don't know what to do so we gotta figure out a way to connect. Schools and businesses together when I talk about. I see business that doesn't necessarily mean private sector employment even though. I'm an officer riverside counties would largest community bank but I'm not just talking about private sector. Government jobs. Healthcare jobs nonprofit jobs any employer. There's a disconnect. So. When sometimes when I speak in front of young people I remind them that employment is by invitation only. Because they will tell me I have a degree Y. want to hire me well. You know it there's gotta be a match. So you have probably heard of the sling shot program that we're doing through the state board. And we. That split the country of the state up into fourteen regions in the Inland Empire is one region so riverside county workforce development board and the symbol of the not county border working as one. And what we're doing there is basically were convening. And we've identified to hide them growth sectors here healthcare and manufacturing and what we've done is we've brought. A top level folks from those two industries together and have them tell us what do you need what workers do you need and then be done that the. Educational institutions and said. Okay. Britain prepare curriculum to match this and then if they come out and they go through that certification. They're guaranteed a job so everybody doesn't need to go to four year university folks can get out of high school go to an apprenticeship training program through that. Trades and they can start making twenty five dollars an hour at age twenty twenty one twenty two they can go into aerospace that can become. Plumbers or electricians or auto mechanics and they can have family supporting jobs community colleges will play a big role associates degrees yes. But four year universities are great for some people. We just have to not have this bias. For young people saying all you're a failure because you don't go to four year university I'm going to stop there because I know of was short on time thank you. For listening. I think you are right you know I actually have a quick question since you just since you were when a little shorter thing your time. How as an employer did used get started in working with the workforce investment board what was what was that kind of catalyst for that? As an employer world was looking for workers and I was involved in the chamber of commerce. And I had heard that. There are a this is the nation's public workforce system so I called my county supervisor. And had them appoint me. And my wife is still cursing that county supervisor. Thought that. We'll tell her we we appreciate it. A pleasure. So I just hearing our panelist in this dire. Discussion it was quite exciting for me to hear about. The new innovative CT models and pathways I that. Is happening now in the LA county area czar it unites only want to see that. Here riverside county that's great you know Jim million mentioned some. Things that I know riverside county is working on. How can we further ensure that we how about middle skilled workforce to hear what what is it that you need from the state legislature? You can share your thoughts I think. One of the encouraging things this morning with the budget the new federal budget because of all this money comes. From the vets and the workforce dollars a different grants. Through the labor agency on the various agencies so. The two year budget actually has put more money and then what the president wanted so now we're going to go over the next three months going to continue to advocate the appropriations committees to make sure. But I I just came back from Washington DC I was there the last three days and. Ninety percent of the members of Congress we talk to both sides of the aisle programs in fact the president even keeps pushing apprenticeship programs. So I think that the workforce innovation opportunities act funding is going to continue and there will be more grants competitive grants and California always does well with those so. The state board of the labor agency will continue to do that I guess one of the challenges we have assembly rooms Cervantes and you can help us. And and not to take anything away from you but we have to always compete with the coastal counties. So we'll have to just have. Yeah. Thank you. Can I also chime in on that. The Senate but they assembly bill I think assembly bill one one one one. That I know you support. A assembly member Burke and this is one that will provide us needed resources to be able to continue doing what we're able to do. And another thing that can be done by the assembly and the Senate is this. Always look to us to provide us more flexibility. Because. There are so many restrictions on what we can and cannot do most of what we do is is has nothing to do with the act itself that we're doing. Is to help the people that we need we don't get paid to work with the community college is a special fine. But we do because we know we have to so flexibility. To allow us to be able to deliver the best services possible to our clients. You can push for more. Career pathways. Programs and for more a industry community college partnerships that'll make a big difference that's what's going to happen. You know we're and we're working on the five hundred million but. I know it's it's never enough. I have one other question about soft skills. I I know you mentioned that that was kind of one of the things you felt link learning was was providing and it's one of the things we hear rate your lead where are. You. That are are falling behind and I'm just curious what you see is the best way to kind of promote those soft skills to create it's one thing for kids to go to school told. To learn the to get there are basic education but it this day and age soft skills are so important kids text messaging in interviews things like that. Who curious what your thoughts are? Yeah I think you hit on at the it's. It's on the job of a high school teacher to teacher of. Of a young person. Job readiness skills. Of. You know. Maybe somebody could argue it should be but it isn't tonight which and expected to be. A. Of that should be. Developed. Really with the experience at at at a work site because there's nothing that the substance for that. In the way you do that. Is by having these of work based learning opportunities in the way you get these work based learning opportunities is through. Some form of its it's either Linklater knitting its arm. Of. Any other programs through the a incentive grants maybe through the governor's. Proposal it it really doesn't it really doesn't matter how it's done as long as there is a. Way for the. For the high schools and to it and to a certain extent the community colleges to develop these relationships with employers. And that's where what what were you come in on this. Is. Our is providing that. Increment of funding because this is. More expensive is not part of the core. Mission of of of a high school it's of the need that incremental funding to develop these. These these partnerships and of a that's where the students were and I like to put in one other. One other plug. On the. That of president Reese mentioned a few minutes ago on tool enrollment I think that's a that's a. Which we found that to be a very successful. A way to advance. Of the students into thinking about the workplace eight. In a many students of there's really great examples in the Central Valley for example. Who graduate from high school? Almost have an a a degree and they are. Ready to be certified and have of a post high school graduate degree where they can get into the workplace or get and it. Get into college. Into a four year institution or quickly so it might wanna put in a plug for that as well. Thanks I like to think the first panel for their comments and we will move to our second panel and ask those who are in the same bill to come up One of the. Well. We had manager. And before we get started on our next panel I do wanna invite everyone in attendance should join us for a reception shortly after this will have a networking reception just down the hallway. So first up our panelist is Dennis Sonny Inland Empire region adviser California manufacturing technology consulting. Hello good afternoon. A sunny Dennis sunny thank you for inviting me to be here. Thank you all for your participation and interest. In this. So I'm with that the National Institute of standards and technology through the department of commerce and there's a center in every single state I've worked with this center for twelve years now. I am boots on the ground diced I've stepped and over seven hundred and fifty manufactures. I'm a gadget guy. Automation man bye by trade and I guess. My my career started out in the marine corps after the marine corps I bought my home I was twenty two years old I Bob my home and group of Valley and I'm still there today. So thank you. These a lot of this we've heard this this afternoon about. The the fourth industrial robot revolution is here and it is growing. I had the pleasure of being a part of the and the and am show this week. And Anaheim there was nineteen thousand manufacturers that were at the show and I played ping pong with the robots and saw all kinds of really cool technologies that's out there. And I'm thankful that Alexa reminded me to get my stuff together to come here today and. You know and and my uber is and and and ways helped me navigate my way to this facility. But the strength of our economy it's it drives the technology advancements. There's over six hundred thousand open manufacturing positions I today I met with the company last week they had thirty eight jobs that were open. Thirty eight they're trying to fail I'm seen twelve manufacturers every single month I have a team. And. There's tube like they they said earlier there's two point seven million baby boomers that are gonna be retiring over the next decade. An estimated by two thousand twenty five two million jobs and advanced manufacturing or will go on failed. Another important fact is there's it takes about ninety days for manufacture to recruit a highly skilled worker today. And that current workforces deficient requiring future and skills training. I am and where are we deficient of course it's the technology computer skills the problem solving skills the basic technical training and math skills. I like this that this display I put up here it's it's a robot on display but it's that it's a person who is. Generating and telling the robot what to do but not only that. He's doing some innovation thinking thinking about that process in his supply chain. So maintaining the industry growth. It will allow us in this region to position this region has a major player and advanced logistics cement manufacturing it gives us the competitive edge. So what I'm after really is the manufacturing industry chatter aye I want people talking about. I want them to consider. A career path in manufacturing there's there's so many really cool technologies that are used out there today. They need to percent. So the impact of what this is doing to the manufacturing work force gap. I eighty two percent. It it's gonna affect customer demand seventy eight percent it's going to in fact their productivity of manufacturing. Our customer service. A being able to make goods to that pace that needs to be said about the need be made from. The impact and the ability to innovate to develop. So what we need we need right people we need right skills right time a right plan and write because. I love this say they shot here this was from the last year I took a group of. Students robotic students and gamers students. Through a company and this is colony high school. Of it we did some really they're holding up a little plate here what I like to about this is I'm taking the children into a manufacturing. It environment so they can see smell here and and see this first hand and and and that's where I I I love the excitement. Into to work with these these children. So one of the work force needs there's a list up here of what's needed here and when I looked at this less putting together this presentation today was like well there's going to be people in the room that. You know there's there's some of these things we cannot a fact so I removed those things here and so under the skilled production workers. What we really need to do is it is it create an attractive attractiveness of this industry? And the and the access to talent goes on to the other side the engineering research and scientists but it was interesting to look at this data as I put this all together for you today. So what a CMT see doing a specifically in the Inland Empire I've been in the Inland Empire a very passionate about manufactures in the Inland Empire. Assembly woman thank you for shadowing me out and the manufacturing plants it's an honor to have you inside those plants seen for yourself. Of what they're making. I my mother moved into my guest house about two years ago and as I drive around the Inland Empire I'm pointing out there making skateboards they're they're doing baseball bats they're they're making bottles there. It's it's a crazy little her way to drive with me but there's so many cool things that are happening in this region so what are we doing. I've organized. In this region a CEO group and for four years now the CEO grope their all. Manufactures we come together once a month and through this group I've been taking this group into schools to speak and talk about to the youth about how they started in maybe in their garage. And. It gets that the students very excited about this. I am part of the corona manufactures council I'm part of the fines Hannah manufactures counsel I work very closely work with the workforce development board. And and we have the peer counsel. At through CMT see. Of we provide recruitment services for management in the higher technology positions at the manufacturing level. And another thing that I am very passionate about his national manufacturing day have. Have from a sigh of hands who is aware of national manufacturing day is the very first Friday. Of October I speak throughout the Inland Empire about this day and what I love about this day is it's a day were manufactures can open up their doors. And allow the community their suppliers their employees families to come into that cell manufacturing plant and see what's being made in this region. So we do that we are part of the whole make and you make it in America program the California make program. And of course the MTC we do have a TP funding for incumbent new hire training. And that also supports a career ladders. As an entry as that. I man who focuses on the manufacturers in this region I am partnered with the community college. I I love working with the Norco campus here they have five different apprenticeship programs that I am I I steer out been and and use through my manufactures. I use the Norco branch almost like my apple one aye aye. They have. Ways of helping my manufactures fill these positions. As I put this the slide deck together there's a lot of things that kind of came out of this and the to and read that I I want to point out to you and that is. The scope of productivity is huge when I walk into a manufacture there's all kinds of ways that we can help them grow. And there's obviously going to be some job I've displacement but I think net net. Automation a robotic technologies allow for the expansion of human consciousness and the expansion of jobs and new opportunities in this region. We're here sharing with students. Software that's used on a two story tall LaserJet machine that's just fascinating to get the children around to see this type of technology. So some potential solutions for manufacturers I'll go to the two that I like the most here. And that's the of managing the. Pipeline like the supply chain analytically driven to help. Place the future process of a students into these positions and then the redesign and the recent thinking of the HR function in a manufacturing environment. Apprenticeship programs we've heard a lot about them today this is one of my manufactures that have opened up from national manufacturing day. The students love getting into these aye manufactures seeing. Smelling and and watching these amazing products being built so. Thank you guys very much. Thank you and now up is doctor Gina fostered director of corona Norco unified CT program. Welcome And thank you. How about now okay good? Good afternoon and thank you for the opportunity to present to this. Hearing. And for the support of. Assert both assembly members that are here. I truly appreciate your commitment to CT <u>&lt;c.green&gt; stem</u> education and then especially assembly member savant as out of it to our veterans. Often it's my pleasure to represent. Not only career technical education in this just in California but also. Front Norco unified school district in the key twelve education system. L. as. We moved through an I listen to our other speakers and. Op where they've come from and what they've talked about I think it's important to note that if we continue to teach like we used to. We're going to Robert children of tomorrow and if you look at the the picture that I have a better. You see the old. Odd dialup cellphone or. Old phone rotary phone compared to the new cell phones I think that really talked to what we're talking a ballot new education. OB new methods of teaching one of my other thoughts on this year's I'm about to be the owner of a nineteen twenty seven model eight. And of course that is going to be my project in retirement stuff history to rebuild this now I can rebuild that but if you ask me to go into a two thousand eighteen. Of Ford F. one fifty forget it I'm not even gonna look at that car so that just tells you the kind of skills in the technical skills that we are now. Teaching our students to do. In corona Norco unified school district there are out we have fourteen of the fifteen industry sectors courses. Are impelled which we offer. Thirty three pathways within those fourteen industry sectors. Course there in various stages of development. Some of our most developed areas our manufacturing and engineering. Which lead truly have a seventh grade through twelfth grade and then fourteen into the community community colleges those develop pathways. We also have strong new pathways in the medical science in medical technology. An information communications and technology. On this next page one of the growing. Areas is definitely the health sciences medical technology. We are Everly grown this program in the last three to four years. El the district we have twenty five articulated courses throughout our. K. twelve system with Norco college. Melt center Tonio community college. A we are expanding our dual enrollment programs right know we have courses that Eleanor Roosevelt high school. We're looking to grow those at centennial and. Norco next year in them to the rest of our comprehensive high schools later on. Additionally we have forty one courses that me a third gene requirements we truly believe in post secondary education. Not just a for year college education although we do prepare students to be college and career ready. One of the exciting things that is coming up is a previous pre apprenticeship pathways. All I've talked to some more group college representatives Theon. What I find most exciting is? With fender music or fender guitar company located right here in corona. As far as our medical technology programs we have pathways in biotechnology a on patient care. Students take trips to places such as Loma Linda cadaver lab. In the school of anesthesiology in Pasadena. We have an instructor and students that are located in the reception that a fifth set up a display for more eastern program and Roosevelt. And she is working on two new junior and senior courses. In infectious disease and pathology. As we move into robotics yeah under coating we also include the supply chain technology program. We do have another school set up in the. Room next door from corona fundamental intermediate school that has. A three D. printer in some of the project that they've developed as well as some of these robotics. But they plan on. Demonstrating after this is over. We have teachers that a ten industry training in adobe Max order death game developers. Solidworks you know I U. S. scared. An SDS to structural steel engineering. Another program that we're highlighting in industry sector that we really are. Are moving forward with is the transportation industry sector. We all of us an automotive technology program. It whenever I schools in you can see from the pictures. There's a simulated electrical system trainer taught in our automotive technology program and what's cool about this erodes the Chiu the instructor can set the system up where a student can troubleshoot. The electronic system this display had every electronic to system. In a car. And so the students can troubleshoot out. Interior that we've been looking to implement for the last year for years that we're finally going to do next year. Is an aviation pathway one course will be aerospace engineering and we will also have ground school. Of course in that we can get students started. In that direction some of our business partners includes compilers from United Airlines. The organization organization of black aerospace engineers March air reserve base and cal Baptists is heavily involved in our pathway development with. Just a K. twelve were up annoying fourteen sixteen of beltway. Next slide more into the manufacturing in engineering. We strive to purchase industry based equipment such as because of a Lincoln welders and stratosphere three D. printers. But industry certification for our students are available in adobe auto CAD snap on in solid works as well as many other areas. We do have some other industry sectors that I wanted to highlight such as or agricultural sciences program. Are. Metal. Are cabinetry and mil working program that we have it too high schools. And we also have information communication technology program throughout the district. We heard the. Games and simulations beltway networking software and systems development. Our continued needs include the employer involvement were we can do job shadow student turn ships and teacher externship. Course funding is always a concern and we appreciate assembly member Burke saw sponsoring a bill that would the continued US support fix career technical education incentive grant. We certainly would like to see the federal government fully authorized a Perkins. A legislation in fully fund our programs from that standpoint. In conclusion. In conclusion. I want to stress that my school district kroner unified school district. Fully believes that all students can be college and career ready. And. They can achieve those through a. Rigorous and relevant. Slash career technical education program. Yeah on would that. Thank you very much for this opportunity to showcase corona Norco unified school district. We will now hear from Catalina missed blur chief a program administration and services division California student aid commission. Okay. So thank you assembly member Burke and assembly member Cervantes on behalf of our executive director Libby that Cortez up a lot. We thank you for inviting us to present information on what the California student aid commission does and its efforts to also. Provide resources to those students who are pursuing at technical career technical degrees and certificates. As you may know the commission provides over two billion dollars in cal grants students attending. Four year institutions community colleges public and private. We're proud to say that we work towards. Providing information to all California high schools and working with also the high schools to ensure that all students all high school seniors have an opportunity. To work towards. Receiving a higher education our mission is to make education beyond high school financially accessible to all Californians and we're proud that we're able to do that. We have. Two programs in particular that our outreach programs that we worked directly with the communities one is our cash for college program. We have workshops throughout the state this year we're proud to say that we reached over a thousand cast for college workshops hearing in California. Working with our high schools are community colleges and our partners in the community as well to promote these workshops so that. Families from low income and disadvantaged backgrounds have the opportunity to learn about financially. We also in our in past year the two thousand sixteen seventeen year we had the opportunity as you know with your the fast said that started on October the first. To start sending out communications to high school seniors informing them that what financial aid was available to them so that they could have the opportunity. To search and to look to see that maybe a four year institution wasn't for them but a community college or vocational technical program was available for them. We received feedback from numerous students and families that they took that letter to their college counselors many of them believe that they didn't have the financial resources to go. Many of them when you when you ask them about college and many of them will tell you that college isn't for them. But when they learn about their vocational educational opportunities then that's when they believe that they can take those steps and they have the financial aid resources available. To get them through those programs. Well the cal grant a program and the cal grant be program focus primarily on the traditional program degree programs at the four year institutions. The cal grant see program. Is aimed at shorter certificate programs it's the primary source of state based aid for career and technical degrees and certificates. In prior years several laws were passed to focus on the cal grant see program it's one of our smaller programs it offers a. Seven thousand seven hundred sixty one awards. We've worked with that employment development department to identify long term unemployed. So that they have an opportunity to identify. The types of programs that may be made available to them and financial aid resources available to them. We also work to identify high need high wage and high growth occupations. Currently the cal grant see program is under utilized and we are continuing to work with our partners we've worked with the California community. That many because chances office to identify students and where they are and what types of programs are enrolled in so that we can so the students can take. Advantage of these programs we're also working with the edge coalition to identify what ways we can communicate and where we need to reach out to the students and families understand what is available for them. To continue their their education. The cal grant see award the amount in prior years we we're proud to say that we're very grateful and thankful to the led the California legislature and the governor. For increasing year award amount on the cal grant see program. To two thousand four hundred sixty two. Towards their tuition and fees and an additional five hundred and forty seven dollars that you is used towards books and supplies. At community college students who are enrolled in and career technical education programs receive a thousand ninety four to use towards their their books and supplies. We have the opportunity to. Follow up with the students and we've learned. That through the process in identifying the students many of these cal grant see students. Do not qualify for the entitlement program. And there are students that graduate directly from high school who become eligible for the high school entitlement program but as you may know many of the students who. Do not enter college immediately after high school and two years later decide to take the courses necessary. To increase their training or their skill set. They do not qualify for the cal grant program and unfortunately they lose an opportunity to have an entitlement award. Therefore the cal grant see program is very important and it is one of the programs that they get they may qualify for and continue to receive to. Help to offset the costs of those. Expenses for the uniforms for books for any of the supplies that they need. Whether enrolled in their vocational your career technical education program. We look forward to continue working with the legislature to see how we can improve the program how we can reach out how we can make the program more available we're very happy to see that the increase of the award and we're very thankful to see that the award was. Increase as we do believe that there are cost beyond what the students can afford to attend in some of these programs even with the with some of the bog fee waivers. Some of that the institutional aid that's provided to them there's still a huge gap for many of the students so work and continue to work and hope that. We can see an increase in these programs in terms of the amount and it continues to get it apart that its need thank you. Thank you. Now for our final panelist touchy on a tour is workforce in training coordinator with great alternatives. Good evening and thank you for giving her the opportunity to come up and. that we have. To address some of the work force. Dishes that we've been talking about during this panel. Just to give you a little bit of background about look good alternatives is and what we do where nonprofit. Bob Hertzberg nurses in the bay area will we do have a regional office here in riverside that covers the Inland Empire and we have another one. That covers that greater Los Angeles area in LA so what we do is we install solar electricity systems to families that qualify depending on where they live and their income level on this or not at no cost for this families. So we like to say our triple bottom line is we help people we help the planet and we also help. Employment by connecting good people in our communities that need. Good meaningful employment. One of our programs that we have is called out woman in solar which is an initiative that's working to build aye they burst equitable and inclusive solar industry by providing pathways. To technical careers I specifically for women. To enter the solar industry aye good alternatives we train all of our staff so that are job trainees and volunteers feel safe as woman. And comfortable working in solar jobs so. How we do think volunteers to help us out during this instances where nonprofit we do recognize that some of these volunteers are actually looking for jobs in the solar industry? And they're with us because they like the skill so. We encourage woman to come on board as job trainees and then we help connect them with a real jobs. We also offer re entry opportunities because good is a supporter of second chances are office in JLA have collaborated with five key charter schools. As well as homeboy industries to provide training for the re entry population. Our office here in the Inland Empire last year we partner with riverside county juvenile hall swiped it program we took two of their interns. They were both in their late teens early twenties. They computer that paid internship with us while they were still in the juvenile hall. And one of them actually moved on to our one year solar core program so he's now employed with us for one year full time employment. Our troops to solar initiative provides solar industry workforce training to US military veterans and active service members. Across the country so this is not just only happening. In the Inland Empire or LA but this is. And national initiative that we have. We have actually. In our office here in riverside we we have partner with the mission continues which is another nonprofit authors veterans. Right now we have to the mission continues fellows in our office. Three permanent staff that are veterans. And actually started as volunteers and are working of solar installers. And. One better in turn as well. And our solar futures program. Aye were directed mostly with us on a futures program a which. The goal of this program is to inspire the next generation of solar leaders we serve youth ages sixteen to twenty four. Andrew partner with different high schools passage of football Valley high school. And riverside unified school district to provide both in classroom training. And real work training to. High school youth so that they can see what's out there in terms of of jobs and we do recognize that not all of them are gonna go to college. But those that do want to go to college have something to put on their resume and also have other careers to think about. Within that renewable industry and those that don't want to go to college get some hands on training before they graduate. When I going in there and I do that in class and training for the students we do have a session where we teach about. Alchemy reading as we teach them about resume building. Job interviews we teach them about different jobs in the solar industry both entry level or mid skilled. Jobs and also does where they would require more education. Tops in the solar industry are continue to grow and the average income for. For a solar installers twenty four dollars an hour and they actually don't require. College degrees. And I a. National growing impacts we've installed systems for over a thousand four hundred families nationally. We continue to promote workforce adversity in the solar industry. We've trained over two thousand two hundred and twenty one participants is to thousand eleven here in the Inland Empire. How we advocate for state state and federal policy we've trained over four hundred and seventy nine tribal volunteers are here in the Inland Empire? And the way we do our work is throughs. Local partnerships with CTE programs Sau with different high schools. And with also political leaders that recognize the importance of the work that we do here at Gran. And this is actually our national numbers with installed over forty thousand kilowatts of solar nationally. Saved over three hundred million dollars to families sweeper. Overall we've trained over thirty five thousand people up for jobs in the solar industry and this our national numbers. And the numbers again change every single day because we have installs every single day at our office here in riverside we have about. Two to three installs per week and that every single install we have volunteers community members that are looking. To give back to their community or also job trainees which or people that are looking for jobs in the industry. And with artists I wanna thank you for giving me the opportunity to share about great and though type of work that we're doing. Did Jeff. To look like the other way. A island had a question. For Catalina. What could we need you to help? Facilitate more utilization of that the cal grant see program is it a function of not in enough funds per. Grander how is it what is the actual issue. The current process I have our. Identifying who those students are. When we identifies students eligible for cal grant and bees. We identify those students as. Students that have indicated that they're pursuing a a degree at a traditional degree. Those students in the calcium program bid what we do want is we want to give those students who are. Could qualify for an entitlement ward that entitlement award because it provides them more in terms of the tuition and fees. And it also provides in four years of those benefits. Those students who do not meet those qualifications than. And up in the pool of applicants for the cal grant see program. Once we identify who those students are we send out a what's called a supplement that ask for additional information to identify the types of programs there and. And I think sometimes students are confused and the types of programs are real Bigelow enrolling classes they may not know that the classes they're taking organ and lead to a particular. Certificate or programs that she if the campus that an identified as such. And so they said will. Indicate that they are identify themselves as not being eligible for the for the casi program. If we had a better opportunity to. Get date out or identify those students better who are in those programs them we could directly communicate with them and form them and process them through. And inform them that they're eligible and just send the funds directly to the campus identify them on the campus rather than having to go to this extra step. Of completing this additional form. So my question is for Regina first off I am very proud to have corona Norco unified within the district and thank you for taking me along the tour. Not too long ago. I I actually won a highlight the quote you mentioned that I like you know how do you see education. Meet the jobs that. Education has of course changed tremendously over the years. Probably one of the biggest impediments we have to continued growth. In our programs. Course financial we need to always work on that but. Burke. Teachers. We desperately need industry experienced teachers. And without that of. It's harder to teach kids a one of my favorite sayings from one of my mentors was. Bob people in my profession career technical educators who do come out of the industry. The more where in education the more we learn about education and the less we work learn about our profession. So it's essential that we continue to to. Have trained professionals in education. And also to provide externships an opportunities for current teachers to learn. Thank you for sharing at my next question I have for Dennis actually thank you for. Aye taking me out into different parts of the district it was actually just last week where I went to a tour a woman ran robotics company. So that was pretty exciting aye but you know wanted to kinda talk about your. On your slide the potential solutions for manufacturers. You mention recruitment from new sources such as veterans and women you how do you effectively recruit our community colleges if you can just share. With us I I I. I put them in touch with I'm with Charles who was in the room here I through an arch how. Aye he's that princess ship director that I've been working with so I. Bring I make that introduction to Charles and then he vets the right apprenticeship program to the and ploy yours Nate. I like the fact that said that the previous question about education I I'd love to see educators out and the manufacturers to see what's changing. How the pace of change is constantly evolving and to stay current? And I I I do towards I share my manufactures with the community with educators. I liked intertwined them so. Silver the representative from grits alternatives I was am a huge fan of your program actually tried to come out volunteer and I asked by to climb on the roof they told me no because I'm clumsy. But. I'd I am curious at how where do you where are you finding your I mean I know I'm a volunteer just because I work in the I worked in the industry but where you finding some of your. Folks that are going through the training program where they coming from. Yeah I currently am a lot of our volunteers actually come through partnerships. And I spoke about that about about Ursula futures program but we also have. Partnerships with community colleges like college of the desert. They have. Peavey program so they don't offer the hands on training for their students so they send them to us to get that component we also partner with. Other. Other schools as well and other. I vocational schools the hive Peavey training but they don't have the opportunity to actually show them what it really looks like when they're out there in the industry. So we partner with them and they bring their students to us. I think we both have more questions but we're were overwhelmed by how many people have public comment so what we're going to is. To ensure that everyone gets an opportunity we're gonna move to public comment portion of the hearing. Up for those that have indicated that they would like to speak on how we're going to ask you to keep your comments down to one minute at this point. To accommodate as many people as we can and I want to thank you all for coming. What? That line up at. The Dyess here. Rendon one line we do into a one liner. You're going to do like. One line here the diets for those who signed up for public comment. Come on guys rear. WTI. It's help these folks out get lined up. Again we wanna thank you all for coming today it's it's. You know deserve porn issue and and and and and important issue that's going to we're going to funding this year so we appreciate your time. The timer timer will be over here. To my right. Begin. Good afternoon. My name's the safe I'm a small business owner in corona. Also on the board of directors of crown a chamber so I represent grounds chamber.

The crowd a chamber CEO Bobby Spiegel who couldn't be here today. I'd like to thank of you. Assembly member of Cervantes and. Local college. For your visionary leadership and. Bringing the business community manufacturing council. Our elected representatives local governments and other stakeholders. Together to prepare us for the growth needs of. Are. Region's future. This an exciting. Period of our development and economic growth in our region just last year. Ground the chamber with the involvement that partnership of the city of corona. Norco college NAVSEA just next. Dress up here. And members of the health manufacturing. Building industry and others develop the chronic twenty twenty platform. Greta twenty twenty as a roadmap to sustaining and growing our current industries as well as to work. With local college and local governments to develop our region. Into Hupp. A destination. At that attracts more jobs businesses. Industries not to mention result the resulting reduction and. Freeway congestion and miles traveled. And obstacle comment to any economic development and growth is the shortage of trained and skilled professionals. This problem has affected my industry in automotives. As well as. Manufacturing industries such as American national manufacturing. That Chad Miller with will address health care. Science and technology industry. It is truly exciting to stand here today and with this. Next steps being taken to address the career technical education and the needs of our industries in the growing. Economy of our region thank you. John Miller American action manufacturing or manufacture here grown. And we manufacturer and many different devices medical consumer aviation aerospace we have seven divisions. And we struggle. With skilled workforce that an industrial sewers I worked with Charles here at the college trying to bring and others to generation gap of industrial sewers. And that's what we do we so up mattresses both on the medical side as well as the consumer side. A and we're trying anything we can do to connect our industry and industrial fabrics with our education system and with the businesses to get that. That cohesiveness to provide the the curriculum and the facility to use our experts. there's a lot of burden on the on the businesses a step up and open their doors and do exactly this I appreciate all you gotta do. We need more of that. On our side I am part of the legislative committee and a board member for the chambers while. I'm and so these relationships are key and critical for us. On we do grow our jobs. Nationally we have our are expanding we're blessed to really be expanding and and we are having a hard time here so anything you ask my son wasn't crying high school and. What did the? Auto mechanics a class there is now to in the military retired from there now at. UT I learning to be a mechanic so an example of how we benefitted from that so it's very important think what you're doing and please continue to more. But I thought that's. My name is Tom chan I'm a scantron. The assessment company for someone to give out all shallow to our classrooms she T. teachers. Because unlike many adult pilots borrowing teachers so prep teachers. Didn't get the kudos de richly deserve as we all know. Because whether you are a college bound or career path bunk. Good teachers make a difference for a student success so. Congratulations to our teachers who are day in and day out working with our students. S. scantron we are looking for public. Private partnership to develop a assessment. In the area all C. T. E.. That's different than forty years of academic assessment we've been doing. Because we want no ensured that the few key students. Have way too the licensure and certification. Them if they we want to develop with our colleagues like we are doing with Alabama state. As well led Louisiana. To develop a serious though. Assessment that can address their success so thank you. Good afternoon. I Melanie Murphy Corwin and I'm a retired to. Cater from corona Norco unified. And it's my honor currently to be serving. I as a commissioner for the instructional quality commission. That works with the California department education to a review and. And. Revise all the frameworks and of standards for all of Creek him K. twelve in the state of California. Although computers have been used in classrooms across the state for many years we've not had definitive standards based on computer science core concepts and compound COR practices. It is my great pleasure as a commissioner. To announce today that computer science standards have been developed by educators appointed by the state board of education. They have been written and they will now go through the process of review public comment editing revision and revisions. Before they are are ultimately OB taken before the state board of education. I it is the goal of the I. QC the California department of education in St board education. That implementation of the standards. Of throughout the state of California will lead to the end result that all students will be prepared to enter college and career. As both critical consumers and also thoughtful artistic creators and innovators of computing technology. And I thank you for all your support. They were names Charles and in with that Norco college and they got a like a partnership cell and I one minute here I got. Labor code seventeen seventy seven point five I won't go do it because we have such a short time. But it does three things for the construction industry. Is one is a creates a procurement. Advantage and also performance requirement ought to use the premises and it saves contractors literally thousands of dollars. When the user presses per apprentice it's huge. Are the other thing that it does is it creates a sustainable funding mechanism corps training trust funds. It doesn't exist outside construction. And it really doesn't exist outside the state. And that's why. California has led an apprenticeship for eighty years that's on that. Labor code was enacted nineteen thirty seven. Most importantly though. Is what it does is it provides a public commitment to apprenticeship in construction and at some we don't have any other industry yet. And so that's my encouragement. Is to look at look into that look into those things at that procurement advantage the financial incentive. And also the performance requirements. I am my name is Michelle denying what the tech company called elevate. My background I for a number years about fifteen years worked on the streets in Boyle heights with workforce development grants. Health and Human Services education all those coming great things and the way about their. And I spoke with your chair of the. Riverside county web I'm gonna be given a demonstration of our software but essentially what elevate is is I'm here to help you guys. With everything you're talking about today on a mad genius your your social media that we are on right but instead of connecting with just adds in trying to sell you junk in all this fake news we get. Yours your jobs scholarship opportunities internships community service projects are fed to you based on your location your interest the school you go to. And that helps build a resume just likely intent because I dimly den are young people NASA's aren't Nestle Saralee going to build a profile there it's intimidating it's not really their skill set. But this will be that platform to. Compensate for that but it's also gonna let all your wraparound services not only from your schools. That how the work. Force development. Funding but every other funding source all communicate together and it's have become. Good afternoon everyone. My name is amber of Dahle I am a junior at centennial high school. And I am a state officer for future business leaders of America. So I end up here because I really want to talk to you guys about what high schoolers see as the benefits of CTE program. And it's actually really interesting that you guys are hitting everything. Spot on that we are requesting that we want to see change in schools. Out we want career based education's we want to learn skills sets that we are interested and we go through our language arts classes in your learning. How to analyze books but these? This isn't necessarily something that most of us want to go into literature. Aye we don't learn resume building in our classes but with the CTE courses like business management leadership and. Graphic design and culinary arts we are learning skills that we want to incorporate into our creator soon I do you want to see more at. Made accessible in schools. Our EP articulated CTE courses. To provide more op trip opportunities for all high schoolers especially those who are worried about colleges in their GPA so I do you want to see a lot more of those classes because that's. The main reason why a lot of us don't and we're scared to take them because we're scared of how they might impact our. High school career. I'm incredibly honored to be here thank you guys so much and I'm really amazed at to see how the back. Behind the scenes works of this all is and how much you guys really. Taken are feedback and. I appreciate everything you guys do it's really fascinating give. I don't go anywhere yeah para. I use one of these and they never really quickly you are and and and incredible example of why we're working so hard on career technical education your eloquent. And intelligent and you really we are proud to have you as as. As an and as the. A representative of what we're trying to do here to thank you for being here today. Hi my name is Seth ground my I am a junior at Norco high school I am enrolled in. The ag program there we currently have roughly four hundred twenty five members the state of California there's about eighty thousand. So what this does for us it's it's it's our RCT program that we have Norco or one of them. What it is it's? Agricultural lated jobs what it's teaching you teaching you flora mechanics all those types of jobs where you get your hands dirty where you're out there working. So what is teaching us it's teaching a step that we can use out there in the field. And so is teaching as not only what we need to do to get a job but it's also be paying us for college. Because is teaching us leadership skills because it's not only the classroom but there's a separate part of it which is specifically designed for leadership. Is assigned a designed to teach us how to work together as a team and to we teams. We can take that to our colleges and news that there. To. Give me so we can his that there and. Help us get more access to other things. It also gives us a. Connections to industry and other people higher up so I could from our program we have gone to a. We've gone to farms up in the central Central Valley region so we can learn all those types of agriculture that we have there and we've gone through. Some mechanic mechanical things I've gone to the Lincoln electric center out there in Reno Nevada so we can learn stuff about that. And so the future CD we're really looking for more at. More so funding because we are currently it's a very. Very expensive program like our table that we just by far one of our classrooms it was. About four thousand dollars just for one table so. It's quite expensive so once again thank you yes. Well and I I actually want to just say thank you the I'm program at Norco high school is quite impressive I went to tour it I with my staff and so what you are doing there is is an example for. Many other schools to also follow so if you to please stay with us Oleanna I would love to talk to you. After this hearing Bankia. Hello ó my name is leery of us I'm a TV production teacher at A. B. Miller high school I'm here but minister. Can Yellin and the I just wanna talk a little bit about how. CG has benefited I'm. The program. At that on our site and in in Fontana. Off Montana just much like the cities of the to you serve our is working class community and CT has allowed. Of students are you know the students in Fontana to be exposed to industry than they normally Paul wouldn't have been exposed to and yes these programs are expensive. But. These students are getting new skills that. You know many other schools don't get the opportunity my classroom. Alone just last year received a huge revamping renovation and. We converted our our classroom into a full on a editing studio for all students as well as the TV production studio where we have our own studio in the students run everything from the lighting. To the audio to the cameras there directing in their. And dubbed the great thing about this is that we've been able to establish. Externships in internships with QVC are in summer you know as well as with Ontario I'm not here today. Hello. My name's Karen Bradford I'm a trustee. With her repeat unified school district and I'm also on. The districts RCT committee. OB I recently visited riverside can of city colleges gateway to college program and saw how nicely. Are Aug ZTE program dovetails with yet. Our I want to invite you to her Ripper Valley high schools innovation center it is something that is so progressive in its pathways to careers that. I took along my oldest brother he said when he was in college he did not have programs. That job would have served him as well as our high school program does. As I've been listening to dare I wanted to say that I'm concerned about hearing the phrase living wage linked with. Of. A technical education arm this seems to imply a minimum and I want everyone to know that it can be an exceptional. Road to liver of better than living wages I have a master's degree of taught it UC riverside but both of my sons who have what is considered. Considered blue collar jobs make far more money than I ever had so please continue to support CT thank you. Hi I'm a teacher at all Kaiser high school Bonta I've been as to come on country but are grown program. We are we received a grant in this office P. grant and we're the plan year right now doing it and the intent. Is to. The kids ready for careers in the droning street. And. A two year program the first year of the in the first year they're going to test for the one all seven. And the FAA one oh seven is remote pilot certification. And so the hope is that the day test for that and six the pastor. Following year they'll go out and do internships and we have a grown to build on how drones are being you in industry. Out to a bill designed modify these drones that I'm I'm pretty excited but the problem I think is a bright future for the kids. This kid is my grandson and I brought him over to the program. Because I think again opportunity for all higher wage jobs. Quite frankly. Retirement plan. So I'm looking forward to that and I I will say to know just the technical side. But many of us teachers classroom teachers work very hard and developing self skills for. The work. No the others beside myself always going oh over that with the kids. And I think of as they go to this program internships it'll that'll be reflect so thank you. Thank you for supporting CT in the funding my name is a Valley McClellan I am a teacher in Fontana at some high school. We were able to start a new aye pathway international business so we have business and finance where we have that and this amazing taker Wall Street live that goes around the classroom. Kids are doing the Wall Street game it's part of the curriculum so when they come in and they see that. It dropped. It's a thank you for the support that was through grant my are entrepreneurship class which I am I just took we had thirty did her. We've had aye. Up to sixty kids compete skills USA in the last few weeks were waiting for results today. Sort entrepreneurship we have a three D. printer we also have print screen that is what this kids used for their products and then they do their own business. And as I said we've competed in schools you're saying other competition so. I'm and then our capstone is the global logistics where we've partnered with chief ecology we've brought in. I'm our industry partners to the kids already gone out seem logistics and seen industry and the distribution center so. I'm I'd like to say thank you because I believe that CT provides meaning a purpose for our kids and that's what motivates them to get that certification on a two year for you. So thank you for idea. Good afternoon my name is Kimberly Corbin I service the principle of group of valley high school. And we and we can't tell you the difference that we see in our students since we've been able to really spend. Really honestly money and and I get the work force out there and really make partnerships and develop these. State of the art centers for our students so we really ask as our grants coming go that we consider the flexibility of our LC up a funding. Because what we built we need it to be sustainable. I'm we partnered for example with great in this room and it cost us to do this but we know what our our students aye it's benefiting the entire community when we do this. So we invest in them we invest in our community so thank you very much for considering that. Good afternoon my name is a funding host on the principle of Fontana high schools we've heard already from three of the high school from the funding for school district. My system principle here miss by overseas the CTE program which is what a talk real briefly about programs that we have and the impact it has on our students. Their students I can enter the promo at sixteen years old when I won that we do have is the fire technology EMR program. We also partner with chief because for the EMT program CQC where they wear uniforms a commensurate days are there for eight hours a day. May go to. Job shadowing and the kids are really enjoyed the see the real world connection another we have is our will be program there on our campus where students actually get certified. So they're there until five six o'clock at night the come in the weekends ago to skills you say the compete they take top honors and the last words are full I see in a program where. Our students actually go and take the state exams and they pass it and they actually get to work at the convalescent home they go to a hospital so they do have that real world experts and the really really enjoyed. The walk around campus with their scrubs are now the kids playing you what do you do in there to go they get so excited effect one of our students those in the senior prom. Was going only do CNA and then go straight to work educators in the California community college this. Thank you so much for holding a hearing for having us that opportunity because you today we especially want to thank you on behalf of the association for support of the strong work force program funds. Our programs are expensive and working very hard to ensure every dollar is focus on our students in the classroom in seamless partnership with our key through twelve partners. Through the California community college a C. C. P. T. grant as well as a strong workforce program. We're grateful for your interest and aligning both the community college courage cushion programs in key through twelve courage creation programs in the budget. I'll mention that it from fiscal year two thousand seven test twenty seventeen that ten year span. The basic urge me the Perkins basic state grant funding has declined from the fed by thirteen percent. The house and Senate must now do their job to begin the protest of setting funding levels for individual programs like Perkins. And see see CA we speaking the finance department about this but wanted to thank you for your attention and noting that the wind that pocket of money evaporates. It makes our job even harder in which is why the vital support we get from your bills and from Chung workforce on and from other state appropriations is so vital for ensuring all these expensive programs. Critics from workforce exist. I also in person at one I think you assembly member savant as a for your sponsorship of AB fourteen a shooting nineteen oh for. A to authorize a tax credit us so that employees can employers can hire registered apprentices as we like to see your local college the registered apprenticeship programs is college without the debt. Thank you very much. I like to think and by the end of today will know how to use this microphone but I'd like to thank everyone. Again today for coming out and again I think. As assembly member survived has repeated eight think this was one of the best. Sheets we've found is if.
