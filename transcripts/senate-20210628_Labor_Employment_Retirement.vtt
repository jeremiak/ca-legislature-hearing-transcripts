00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:56.394

00:45:36.667 --> 00:45:38.168
APPROPRIATE MISTER CHAIR AND

00:45:38.235 --> 00:45:39.636
ALSO WANT TO APPLAUD THE

00:45:39.703 --> 00:45:42.506
AUTHOR- I THINK THIS IS SUCH AN

00:45:42.573 --> 00:45:44.274
IMPORTANT CONNECTION TO MAKE

00:45:44.341 --> 00:45:46.643
BETWEEN. OUR ENVIRONMENTAL

00:45:46.710 --> 00:45:48.745
NEEDS ESPECIALLY AND I REALLY

00:45:48.812 --> 00:45:50.814
APPRECIATE CHANGING THE WORD

00:45:50.881 --> 00:45:52.649
DISADVANTAGED UNDER RESOURCE.

00:45:52.716 --> 00:45:54.318
IT'S NOT LIKE COMMUNITIES ARE

00:45:54.384 --> 00:45:56.220
BORN DISADVANTAGED IS BECAUSE A

00:45:56.286 --> 00:45:59.556
DELIBERATE DECISION IS MADE.

00:45:59.623 --> 00:46:01.892
OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN TO

00:46:01.959 --> 00:46:03.861
UNDER RESOURCE NOT PROVIDE THE

00:46:03.927 --> 00:46:06.597
RESOURCES FOR THOSE COMMUNITIES

00:46:06.663 --> 00:46:07.664
THAT'S WHAT CREATES A

00:46:07.731 --> 00:46:11.034
DISADVANTAGE IT'S NOT THE OTHER

00:46:11.101 --> 00:46:13.504
WAY AROUND- I THINK THE- THE

00:46:13.570 --> 00:46:15.272
PART OF BEING UNDER RESOURCE IS

00:46:15.339 --> 00:46:17.007
NOT HAVING ACCESS TO GOOD JOBS

00:46:17.074 --> 00:46:19.109
GOOD PAYING JOBS. WE HAVE TO

00:46:19.176 --> 00:46:20.878
COME TO GRIPS WITH THAT BECAUSE

00:46:20.944 --> 00:46:23.647
WE CANNOT DO OUR ENVIRONMENTAL

00:46:23.714 --> 00:46:28.886
DUTIES- AND CREATE LOW PAYING

00:46:28.952 --> 00:46:30.888
JOBS AND THEN THAT CREATES A

00:46:30.954 --> 00:46:33.123
DEMAND FOR MORE AFFORDABLE LOW

00:46:33.190 --> 00:46:34.791
INCOME HOUSING THEN THAT. I

00:46:34.858 --> 00:46:36.026
MEAN IT'S JUST A TERRIBLE

00:46:36.093 --> 00:46:38.595
VICIOUS CYCLE SO I THINK- THIS

00:46:38.662 --> 00:46:40.998
IS THIS IS THE DIRECTION OF

00:46:41.064 --> 00:46:42.399
HIGHROAD PARTNERSHIPS THAT

00:46:42.466 --> 00:46:44.701
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT I KNOW IN

00:46:44.768 --> 00:46:47.171
THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT-

00:46:47.237 --> 00:46:49.840

THIS PART BUT IT'S MY

00:47:15.165 --> 00:47:17.301
UNDERSTANDING THAT ANY STATE

00:47:17.367 --> 00:47:19.836

FROM A LOCAL PERSPECTIVE I IT'S

00:47:39.656 --> 00:47:41.725
MY UNDERSTANDING THAT ANYTHING

00:47:41.792 --> 00:47:44.661
THAT HAS STATE FUNDING. MUST BE

00:47:44.728 --> 00:47:48.465
OUR EMPLOYEES MUST BE PAID-

PREVAILING WAGE- I'M GOING TO

00:47:50.901 --> 00:47:51.969

HAVE A 100% CONCRETE ANSWER HOW

00:47:55.939 --> 00:47:57.841
HOWEVER CLEARLY THAT'S NOT THE

00:47:57.908 --> 00:47:59.376
CASE BECAUSE WE START TO SIGN.

00:47:59.443 --> 00:48:01.812
BUTTON YES THIS GERRY SMITH

00:48:01.878 --> 00:48:02.746
ROBERT HALF OF THE STATE

00:48:02.813 --> 00:48:04.014
BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION

00:48:04.081 --> 00:48:04.581
TRADES COUNCIL YES THAT IS

00:48:04.648 --> 00:48:05.949
CORRECT SNATOR. ANY

00:48:06.016 --> 00:48:07.818
CONSTRUCTION PROJECT- THE

00:48:07.884 --> 00:48:10.787
ESTATE FUNDING OVER A THOUSAND

00:48:10.854 --> 00:48:11.288
DOLLARS DOES HAVE TO PAY

00:48:11.355 --> 00:48:13.290
PREVAILING WAGE. OKAY SO WITH

00:48:13.357 --> 00:48:15.592
THAT IN MIND- AIDS CONTINUES WE

00:48:15.659 --> 00:48:17.561
SEE THIS- OPPOSITION TO

00:48:17.628 --> 00:48:20.464
BRITAIN'S STATUTE- WHAT I CALL

00:48:20.530 --> 00:48:24.167
THEM. IN MY PERSONAL OPINION-

00:48:24.234 --> 00:48:26.303
DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES WERE

00:48:26.370 --> 00:48:27.237
NOT EVERYONE HAS THE ABILITY TO

00:48:27.304 --> 00:48:30.841
BID. ON THESE PROJECTS- GIVEN

00:48:30.907 --> 00:48:31.942
THE FACT AND WITH THE

00:48:32.009 --> 00:48:34.211
UNDERSTANDING THAT WE ARE

00:48:34.278 --> 00:48:36.647
TRYING TO PROVIDE A PREVAILING

00:48:36.713 --> 00:48:39.416
WAGE JOBS BUT- IT IS MANDATORY

00:48:39.483 --> 00:48:40.450
IT'S AN STATURE REDDING

00:48:40.517 --> 00:48:42.352
CALIFORNIA THAT ANYBODY THAT

00:48:42.419 --> 00:48:45.689
BIDS OR PROVIDES OR OR OR-

00:48:45.756 --> 00:48:46.990
BASED ON THESE PROJECTS THAT

00:48:47.057 --> 00:48:48.925
PROVIDE YOU JOBS ON STATE.

00:48:48.992 --> 00:48:50.694
FUNDED PROJECTS ARE PREVAILING

00:48:50.761 --> 00:48:54.097
WAGE SO I HAVE A CONCERN WITH

00:48:54.164 --> 00:48:55.532
THIS BILL IN THE SENSE THAT WE

00:48:55.599 --> 00:48:58.435
DON'T HAVE- WE'RE LIMITING. YOU

00:48:58.502 --> 00:49:00.404
CAN BID FOR THESE JOBS NOT

00:49:00.470 --> 00:49:03.774
NECESSARILY- WITH THE FACT THAT

00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:05.242
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE PAYING

00:49:05.309 --> 00:49:06.276
PREVAILING WAGE BECAUSE THEY

00:49:06.343 --> 00:49:08.845
HAVE TO- BUT MY CONCERN WOULD

00:49:08.912 --> 00:49:12.115
BE IN AREAS WHERE. LABOR IS-

00:49:12.182 --> 00:49:14.818
LIMITED- YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE

00:49:14.885 --> 00:49:16.787
A LOT OF. OPPORTUNITIES FOR

00:49:16.853 --> 00:49:17.888
DIFFERENT COMPANIES TO COME IN

00:49:17.954 --> 00:49:20.490
BED SO THAT THAT THAT MAKES THE

00:49:20.557 --> 00:49:21.591
NUMBER OF COMPANIES I CAN BID

00:49:21.658 --> 00:49:23.660
ON PROJECTS TO A SMALLER NUMBER

00:49:23.727 --> 00:49:25.562
WHICH MEANS THAT THE COST OF.

00:49:25.629 --> 00:49:26.763
DOING THAT PROJECT NOT THE FACT

00:49:26.830 --> 00:49:27.798
THAT THEY'RE NOT BE FEELING

00:49:27.864 --> 00:49:29.032
PREVAILING WAGE BECAUSE THEY

00:49:29.099 --> 00:49:30.967
HAVE TO DO THAT BUT THE COST.

00:49:31.034 --> 00:49:33.837
OF THE PROFIT MARGIN WOULD BE

00:49:33.904 --> 00:49:36.473
HIGHER. SO THE PUT THE PRICES

00:49:36.540 --> 00:49:37.274
WOULD BE MUCH MUCH HIGHER FOR

00:49:37.341 --> 00:49:38.842
THESE PROJECTS. I JUST WANNA

00:49:38.909 --> 00:49:39.876
MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE

00:49:39.943 --> 00:49:41.078
SAYING THAT EVEN THOUGH THEY

00:49:41.144 --> 00:49:42.346
HAVE TO PAY PREVAILING WAGE

00:49:42.412 --> 00:49:43.980
WHICH WOULD BE THE SAME AMOUNT

00:49:44.047 --> 00:49:45.282
THAT THE PRIME WHY WOULD THE

00:49:45.349 --> 00:49:46.616
PROJECT BE MORE EXPENSIVE IN

00:49:46.683 --> 00:49:47.984
YOUR PURVIEW BECAUSE THERE

00:49:48.051 --> 00:49:49.353
WOULD BE LESS PEOPLE BIDDING ON

00:49:49.419 --> 00:49:51.455
THE PROJECTS SO. BECAUSE

00:49:51.521 --> 00:49:53.957
THERE'S LESS PEOPLE BE ABLE TO

00:49:54.024 --> 00:49:56.026
BID ON THESE PROJECTS IT COULD

00:49:56.093 --> 00:49:58.395
FACILITATE THAT PROFIT MARGIN

00:49:58.462 --> 00:50:01.064
TO GO HIGHER- BUT IF YOU OPEN

00:50:01.131 --> 00:50:03.333
IT TO ANYONE AND EVERYONE. ON

00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:04.101
THE ROCK SHE WOULD BE AN

00:50:04.167 --> 00:50:06.570
EFFECTIVE MEANS OF BEATING

00:50:06.636 --> 00:50:08.138
PROCESS ON IT TONIGHT I GUESS

00:50:08.205 --> 00:50:09.940
MY CONFUSION IS THAT WHY

00:50:10.006 --> 00:50:11.441
WOULDN'T ANY OF THEM BE ABLE TO

00:50:11.508 --> 00:50:12.476
WORK WITH THE BUILDING TRADES

00:50:12.542 --> 00:50:14.277
WHY WOULD ANY OF THEM NOT BE

00:50:14.344 --> 00:50:14.911
ALLOWED TO WORK WITH BUILDING

00:50:14.978 --> 00:50:16.813
TRADES. NO I'M GOING TO PUT

00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:19.015
PRINT ON MY GOAL IS. MY INTENT

00:50:19.082 --> 00:50:20.517
IS TO EMPHASIZE THAT I WOULD

00:50:20.584 --> 00:50:22.052
LOVE FOR IT TO BE OPEN TO

00:50:22.119 --> 00:50:25.088
EVERYONE NOT JUST PARTICULARLY-

00:50:25.155 --> 00:50:26.890
IT IS OPEN TO EVERYONE WE'RE

00:50:26.957 --> 00:50:28.158
NOT WE'RE NOT SAYING THAT

00:50:28.225 --> 00:50:29.426
THERE'S ANYONE THAT CANNOT BE

00:50:29.493 --> 00:50:30.894
IT WE'RE JUST SAYING THAT THEY

00:50:30.961 --> 00:50:32.295
IT SHOULD BE THROUGH AN

00:50:32.362 --> 00:50:34.131
APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM AND-

00:50:34.197 --> 00:50:35.766
HAVE WORKED WITH THE- WITH. AN

00:50:35.832 --> 00:50:36.767
APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM THE

00:50:36.833 --> 00:50:38.101
CONSTRUCTION TRADES THAT IS NOT

00:50:38.168 --> 00:50:39.736
SAYING THAT ANYONE CAN BID

00:50:39.803 --> 00:50:41.037
ANYONE CAN WORK WITH THE

00:50:41.104 --> 00:50:42.072
BUILDING TRADES AS A MATTER OF

00:50:42.139 --> 00:50:44.241
FACT IN MY WORK ON THIS BILL

00:50:44.307 --> 00:50:46.009
TALKING TO THE OPPOSITION.

00:50:46.076 --> 00:50:46.877
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHEN THEY

00:50:46.943 --> 00:50:48.178
SAY THAT THERE'S AREAS WHERE

00:50:48.245 --> 00:50:50.013
THERE'S LACK OF WORKERS. IT IS

00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:51.148
ACTUALLY THE JOB OF THE

00:50:51.214 --> 00:50:52.315
BUILDING TRADES TO WORK WITH

00:50:52.382 --> 00:50:53.183
THESE COMPANIES TO MAKE SURE

00:50:53.250 --> 00:50:54.918
THAT THEY BUILD THAT DROP

00:50:54.985 --> 00:50:56.052
FORGED IN ANY AREAS THAT THAT

00:50:56.119 --> 00:51:00.090
THAT. THERE AREN'T THE AMPLE

00:51:00.157 --> 00:51:00.657
AMOUNT OF WORKERS AND TO GET

00:51:00.724 --> 00:51:01.258
FROM THERE. SO THIS DOES LIMIT

00:51:01.324 --> 00:51:02.292
WHO CAN BID. AND NOW I

00:51:02.359 --> 00:51:03.460
UNDERSTAND THAT THAT'S A WAY TO

00:51:03.527 --> 00:51:05.429
LOOK AT IT IF YOU WANT TO. BUT

00:51:05.495 --> 00:51:07.097
THE REALITY IS IT DOESN'T LET

00:51:07.164 --> 00:51:08.698
LIMIT WHO THERE'S NO

00:51:08.765 --> 00:51:09.299
LIMITATIONS TO WHO CAN WORK

00:51:09.366 --> 00:51:10.901
WITH THE CONSTRUCTION TRADES.

00:51:10.967 --> 00:51:12.769
OKAY SO ANYONE FROM ANY

A MIDDLE CLASS BENEFITS- IT

00:51:30.187 --> 00:51:32.155
FIXES THE COST OF LABOR.

00:51:32.222 --> 00:51:33.657
EVERYBODY'S GETTING ON THE SAME

00:51:33.723 --> 00:51:35.325

THE NEED FOR SURVIVORS WHO ARE

WHAT APPEARS TO BE THE SAME

02:31:24.975 --> 02:31:27.812
LANGUAGE NOW BEING- APPLIED TO

02:31:27.878 --> 02:31:30.247
VICTIMS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING. I

02:31:30.314 --> 02:31:32.283
DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW ALL YOU

FOR SEVERAL OF THE VICTIMS THAT

02:31:51.035 --> 02:31:53.604
WE ARE WORKING WITH IT IS THE

02:31:53.671 --> 02:31:56.841
LACK OF EDUCATIONAL- EXPERIENCE

02:31:56.907 --> 02:31:58.008
AT THE HOUSE BECAUSE MANY OF

02:31:58.075 --> 02:31:59.643
THEM AS WE SAID HAVE BEEN.

02:31:59.710 --> 02:32:00.511
PULLED INTO THE TRAFFICKING

02:32:00.578 --> 02:32:03.314
LIFE- WHEN THEY WERE JUVENILES

02:32:03.380 --> 02:32:04.849
AND SO IF THEY'VE REACHED

02:32:04.915 --> 02:32:06.350
ADULTHOOD A LOT OF THEM ARE

02:32:06.417 --> 02:32:07.518

PROCESS OF OBTAINING YOUR HIGH

02:32:09.119 --> 02:32:11.088

ADDITIONALLY ALTHOUGH THEY MAY

02:32:12.356 --> 02:32:14.758
HAVE- SOME FELONY CONVICTIONS

02:32:14.825 --> 02:32:16.093
WHAT WE ALSO SEE IS SOME OF

02:32:16.160 --> 02:32:17.561
THEM HAVE EXTREME DIFFICULTIES

02:32:17.628 --> 02:32:19.330
IN TRYING TO CLEAR UP THOSE

02:32:19.396 --> 02:32:21.131
MATTERS. BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T

02:32:21.198 --> 02:32:22.700
BEEN ABLE TO TRAVEL TO OTHER

02:32:22.766 --> 02:32:24.401
JURISDICTIONS AND SELL OUR%

02:32:24.468 --> 02:32:26.103
ORGANIZATION THROUGH THE FAMILY

02:32:26.170 --> 02:32:28.405
JUSTICE CENTERS WILL HELP THEM-

02:32:28.472 --> 02:32:30.374
CLEAN UP THOSE RECORDS. BUT WE

02:32:30.441 --> 02:32:32.743
DO FIND THAT SOMETIMES THAT THE

02:32:32.810 --> 02:32:34.111

HAVE- CRIMINAL RECORDS IN

02:32:37.848 --> 02:32:39.884
MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS AND THAT

02:32:39.950 --> 02:32:40.484
COULD BE A HINDRANCE FOR THEM

02:32:40.551 --> 02:32:42.453
THAT PERHAPS. FOSTER USE MAY

02:32:42.520 --> 02:32:46.857
NOT BE ABLE TO BE DEALING WITH.

02:32:46.924 --> 02:32:50.027
WHEN SEEKING EMPLOYMENT. MISTER

02:32:50.094 --> 02:32:53.097
CHAIR THE SERVER I'M THINKING

02:32:53.163 --> 02:32:56.267
HE SAID THE THAT DIDN'T ADDRESS

02:32:56.333 --> 02:32:57.501
THE QUESTION AND IF YOU LOOK

AT. IT EDUCATION WE PRIORITIZE

02:33:02.206 --> 02:33:04.875
A FOR FUNDING AND- OF FOSTER

02:33:04.942 --> 02:33:06.510

THAT WE CAN DO WE PRIORITIZE

02:33:19.490 --> 02:33:20.457
AND I THINK WHAT THE SENATOR

02:33:20.524 --> 02:33:22.026
WAS ASKING IS HOW DOES THIS

02:33:22.092 --> 02:33:24.795

WEST MENDOZA SAID TO IT- I

02:33:28.999 --> 02:33:31.135

02:33:45.883 --> 02:33:47.017

AFTER THAT BECAUSE- THERE WERE

02:37:07.684 --> 02:37:09.920
TWO DIFFERENT ISSUES HERE. AND

02:37:09.987 --> 02:37:12.122
ONE IS ONE OF THE PROCESS DO

02:37:12.189 --> 02:37:13.524
YOU USE FOR DEALING WITH THE

02:37:13.590 --> 02:37:15.425
DIFFERENT CATEGORIES IN MAKING

SURE THEY ALL GET A SHOT. THE

02:37:17.127 --> 02:37:19.463
SECOND ISSUE IS MAKING THE CASE

02:37:19.530 --> 02:37:20.230
FOR THIS ONE PARTICULAR

02:37:20.297 --> 02:37:22.099
