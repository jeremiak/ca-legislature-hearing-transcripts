01:42:35.682 --> 01:42:37.918
BUT WHAT I DO THINK IS THIS IS

01:42:37.985 --> 01:42:41.088
ACHIEVABLE IN THIS SENSE OF WE

01:42:41.154 --> 01:42:44.758

TO THE HOME HEALTH CARE SERVICES.

02:07:52.731 --> 02:07:54.333

02:09:37.369 --> 02:09:39.004
ABSOLUTELY SO THE COMMISSION HAS

02:09:39.071 --> 02:09:40.205
REGULATORY AUTHORITY OVER

02:09:40.272 --> 02:09:42.908

AS PART OF THAT EFFORT WE'VE

02:09:47.012 --> 02:09:49.281
REQUIRED EVERY PROGRAM TO REPORT

02:09:49.348 --> 02:09:50.582
TO THE STATE DETAILED

02:09:50.649 --> 02:09:53.018

THAT'S SOMETHING THAT HASN'T

THERE'S SOME CONTROVERSY THERE

02:10:05.197 --> 02:10:06.732
BUT HOW WE WOULD MEASURE THAT.

02:10:06.798 --> 02:10:07.833
THE COMMISSION'S ARGUMENT IS

02:10:07.900 --> 02:10:09.134
THAT WE NEED TO GET A HANDLE ON

02:10:09.201 --> 02:10:10.736

WE BUILT A WEBSITE.

02:10:19.144 --> 02:10:20.212
THAT ALLOWS ANY MEMBER OF THE

02:12:28.340 --> 02:12:29.975
FOR THAT PERSON TO BE SEEN OR TO

02:12:30.042 --> 02:12:31.476

THE AS AS IT IS PROPOSED NOW THE

02:12:44.056 --> 02:12:45.791
INTENT IS TO UNDERSTAND THE

02:12:45.857 --> 02:12:48.360
OUTCOMES SO THAT WE CAN THEN

02:12:48.427 --> 02:12:50.395
INVEST MORE EVALUATION BECAUSE

THE SCALE OF THAT PROBLEM IS

02:12:56.868 --> 02:12:59.004
BEYOND THE RESOURCES THAT WERE

02:12:59.071 --> 02:13:01.473

IN ACCESSING CARE BUT IT IT'S

02:13:32.671 --> 02:13:33.939
THE REASON IT'S CHALLENGING IS

02:13:34.005 --> 02:13:36.241
BECAUSE WE HAVE FIVE THOUSAND

02:13:36.308 --> 02:13:37.342

THE FUNDING THAT WAS AVAILABLE

BUT IN THE MOST RECENT TWO

02:33:07.978 --> 02:33:09.113
ALLOCATIONS AT A TIME WHEN THE

02:33:09.179 --> 02:33:10.581
FUNDING HAS BEEN DRAMATICALLY

02:33:10.648 --> 02:33:11.348

THE FUNDING I HAVE SEEN NO

02:33:15.819 --> 02:33:18.422
ACTUAL GAINS IN THE AMOUNT OF

FUNDING THAT THEY'RE RECEIVING.

02:33:19.990 --> 02:33:20.891
WE'RE SEEKING TO ADDRESS THIS BY

02:33:20.958 --> 02:33:22.526
ASKING THE LEGISLATORS

02:33:22.593 --> 02:33:23.961
LEGISLATURE TO SET A SIDE

02:33:24.028 --> 02:33:25.429

ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND WE'RE

02:33:29.433 --> 02:33:31.135
ASKING THAT THE EXTRA TWO

02:33:31.201 --> 02:33:35.005
MILLION DOLLARS BE ALLOCATED.

02:33:35.072 --> 02:33:36.640
SO THAT ARE. 10% DOESN'T TAKE

02:33:36.707 --> 02:33:37.508
AWAY FROM ANYBODY WHO'S

02:33:37.575 --> 02:33:39.176
BENEFITED FROM THE CHANGES TO

02:33:39.243 --> 02:33:40.744
THE ALLOCATION FORMULA -- BUT I

02:33:40.811 --> 02:33:42.279
JUST WANT TO CLOSE BY MENTIONING

02:33:42.346 --> 02:33:43.347
TWO REASONS WHY IT'S IMPORTANT

02:33:43.414 --> 02:33:44.715
THAT WE REALLY DO INVEST IN

02:33:44.782 --> 02:33:46.417
PEDIATRIC RESIDENCY IS AS A

02:33:46.483 --> 02:33:47.251
STATE.

02:33:47.318 --> 02:33:48.852
FIRST PEDIATRICIANS RECEIVE

02:33:48.919 --> 02:33:50.688
SUBSTANTIALLY MORE TRAINING TIME

02:33:50.754 --> 02:33:51.822
AND HOURS WITH CHILDREN AND

02:33:51.889 --> 02:33:52.823
ADOLESCENTS AND ACUTE CARE

02:33:52.890 --> 02:33:54.124
SETTINGS WHICH MEANS THEY CAN

02:33:54.191 --> 02:33:55.693
HANDLE A LOT MORE ISSUES WITHOUT

02:33:55.759 --> 02:33:57.094
HAVING TO RETURN REFER THOSE

02:33:57.161 --> 02:33:58.162
CHILDREN NOT TO SPECIALISTS.

02:33:58.228 --> 02:33:59.096
SO ESPECIALLY IN RURAL

02:33:59.163 --> 02:34:01.098
COMMUNITIES THEY PROVIDE A VALUE

02:34:01.165 --> 02:34:01.865
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE

02:34:01.932 --> 02:34:02.833
ENOUGH OF THEM.

02:34:02.900 --> 02:34:04.268
SECONDLY PEDIATRIC RESIDENCY

02:34:04.335 --> 02:34:05.669
PROGRAMS RECEIVE SUBSTANTIALLY

02:34:05.736 --> 02:34:07.338
LESS FEDERAL FUNDING THAN OTHER

02:34:07.404 --> 02:34:08.706
TYPES OF RESIDENCY PROGRAMS

02:34:08.772 --> 02:34:10.040
BECAUSE WE DON'T SERVE ANY MONEY

02:34:10.107 --> 02:34:11.642
ON MEDICARE.

02:34:11.709 --> 02:34:13.010
MEDICARE FUNDS RESIDENCY SLOT OF

02:34:13.077 --> 02:34:15.245
A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS AND

02:34:15.312 --> 02:34:16.313
CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL SEAT GME

02:34:16.380 --> 02:34:17.247
FROM THE FEDERAL LEVEL ONLY

02:34:17.314 --> 02:34:18.749
FUNDS ABOUT SIXTY THOUSAND

02:34:18.816 --> 02:34:19.316
DOLLARS A SLOT.

02:34:19.383 --> 02:34:20.584
THAT LEAVES THE INSTITUTIONS

02:34:20.651 --> 02:34:21.919
THAT PROVIDE THAT PROGRAM AND

02:34:21.986 --> 02:34:23.621
THE STATE'S TO BACK FILL THAT

02:34:23.687 --> 02:34:24.922
AND SO IT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAN

02:34:24.989 --> 02:34:26.724
EVER THAT WE CONTINUE.

02:34:26.790 --> 02:34:28.492
THAT COMMITMENT AND FOR THOSE

02:34:28.559 --> 02:34:29.760
REASONS WE HOPE YOU INCLUDE OUR

02:34:29.827 --> 02:34:30.728

02:34:56.420 --> 02:34:57.888
CENTRAL CALIFORNIA -- WE HAVE A

02:35:01.825 --> 02:35:02.926
PRIVILEGE OF REPRESENTING IT BUT

02:35:02.993 --> 02:35:03.894
I WAS.

02:35:03.961 --> 02:35:06.697
TAKEN ABACK BY [inaudible]

02:35:06.764 --> 02:35:08.999
HOW LITTLE?

02:35:09.066 --> 02:35:10.034
GMAT IT.

02:35:10.100 --> 02:35:12.736
THESE HOSPITALS ARE RECEIVING.

02:35:12.803 --> 02:35:15.239
AND SO YOU KNOW WE DUG INTO IT

02:35:15.305 --> 02:35:17.474
AND LOOKED AT IT AND ASK AS WAS.

02:35:17.541 --> 02:35:18.075
PRESENT I I DON'T KNOW WHAT I

02:35:18.142 --> 02:35:19.943
SHOULD.

02:35:20.010 --> 02:35:20.544
PENSION.

02:35:20.611 --> 02:35:23.180
INTENTION WAS BUT THE RESULT HAS

02:35:23.247 --> 02:35:26.517
BEEN THIS ARE HORRIBLE A

02:35:26.583 --> 02:35:27.618
SHORTFALL IN FUNDING THAT HAS.

02:35:27.685 --> 02:35:28.752
REALLY UP. TO ME MAKES

02:35:28.819 --> 02:35:31.088
ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE BECAUSE WE

02:35:31.155 --> 02:35:31.689
HAVE SO MANY CHILDREN ON MEDI

02:35:31.755 --> 02:35:32.589
CAL.

02:35:32.656 --> 02:35:34.158
IS REALLY HAS TO BE SOMETHING OF

02:35:34.224 --> 02:35:35.325
A HIGH PRIORITY I THINK SO I

02:35:35.392 --> 02:35:35.959
THINK.

02:35:36.026 --> 02:35:38.328
IT'S A REASONABLE REQUEST --

02:35:38.395 --> 02:35:39.997

02:35:42.533 --> 02:35:43.834
AT THE SAME TIME IT DOES NOT

02:35:43.901 --> 02:35:44.668
TAKE AWAY FROM THOSE OTHER

02:35:44.735 --> 02:35:45.903
PROGRAMS I THOUGHT THAT WAS AN

02:35:45.969 --> 02:35:47.371
IMPORTANT ELEMENT.

02:35:47.438 --> 02:35:48.605

03:03:10.713 --> 03:03:11.814
YOU LOOK AT THE INCREASE IN

03:03:11.880 --> 03:03:14.416
POPULATION CALIFORNIA COMPARED

03:03:14.483 --> 03:03:16.452
TO AS HE DEEP -- GROWTH WE'VE

03:03:16.518 --> 03:03:17.619
SEEN THIS -- SIX TIMES GROWTH

03:03:17.686 --> 03:03:19.855
INCLUDE MEDIA SCENE TWENTY FIVE

03:03:19.922 --> 03:03:20.956
TIMES A GROWTH AND GONORRHEA

03:03:21.023 --> 03:03:22.324
SCENE TWENTY EIGHT TIMES THE

03:03:22.391 --> 03:03:24.326
GROWTH AND SYPHILIS WE SEEM

03:03:24.393 --> 03:03:25.394
FORTY TWO TIMES THE GROWTH IN

03:03:25.461 --> 03:03:27.196
CONGENITAL SYPHILIS.

03:03:27.262 --> 03:03:28.564
AND THE WORST MOST TRAGIC

03:03:28.630 --> 03:03:30.199
OUTCOME OF THE LATTER IS THE

03:03:30.265 --> 03:03:32.334
FACT THAT WOULD -- IN TWENTY

03:03:32.401 --> 03:03:33.302
SEVENTEEN WE HAD THIRTY

03:03:33.369 --> 03:03:35.237
STILLBIRTHS -- FROM CONGENITAL

03:03:35.304 --> 03:03:36.372
SYPHILIS IT'S AN EPIC IN

03:03:36.438 --> 03:03:37.740
EPIDEMIC HAS GOTTEN WAY OUT OF

03:03:37.806 --> 03:03:39.875
CONTROL AND IT'S FAR PAST TIME

03:03:39.942 --> 03:03:41.343
FOR US TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT --

03:03:41.410 --> 03:03:42.344
WE'RE HERE ASKING THE

03:03:42.411 --> 03:03:43.846
LEGISLATURE TO AUGMENT THE

03:03:43.912 --> 03:03:45.614
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL OF TWO

03:03:45.681 --> 03:03:46.849
MILLION ON ON GOING AS TO THE

03:03:46.915 --> 03:03:47.416
FUNDS.

03:03:47.483 --> 03:03:48.417
I'M WITH ANOTHER EIGHTEEN

03:03:48.484 --> 03:03:49.585
MILLION FOR A TWENTY MILLION

03:03:49.651 --> 03:03:52.020

03:03:52.087 --> 03:03:52.688
TO THAT WE HAVE SUBMITTED TO THE

03:03:52.755 --> 03:03:54.490
COMMITTEE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE

03:03:54.556 --> 03:03:56.625
THAT WOULD GIVE MORE DIRECTION

03:03:56.692 --> 03:03:57.559
TO THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH.

03:03:57.626 --> 03:03:59.194
ON HOW THOSE FUNDS COULD BE

03:03:59.261 --> 03:04:01.764
SPENT -- IF YOU LOOK AT CURRENT

03:04:01.830 --> 03:04:03.098
STATUTE CURRENT STATUTE THE

03:04:03.165 --> 03:04:04.833
GIVES DIRECTION IS ONE SENTENCE

03:04:04.900 --> 03:04:05.601
LONG.

03:04:05.667 --> 03:04:07.002
WE THINK THAT AS FAR IN ADEQUATE

03:04:07.069 --> 03:04:08.036
TO GIVE DIRECTION TO THE

03:04:08.103 --> 03:04:09.304

DEAL WITH THIS EPIDEMIC ON THAT

03:04:20.249 --> 03:04:21.717
WERE NOT CONSIDERED WHEN THAT

03:04:21.784 --> 03:04:23.786

IS IS IS ACTUALLY SHOCKING WE

ABSOLUTELY SHOCKING IS

[inaudible]

03:05:37.326 --> 03:05:38.861
IS THERE.

03:05:38.927 --> 03:05:40.329
IS WHAT IS THERE AN EXPLANATION

03:05:40.395 --> 03:05:42.231
I'M IN MEAN I I REMEMBER AS A

03:05:42.297 --> 03:05:44.066
STUDENT IN SCHOOL BEING EDUCATED

03:05:44.132 --> 03:05:46.435
ABOUT THESE THINGS AND AND I THE

03:05:46.502 --> 03:05:49.304
THE THE INCIDENTS WAS NOT NEARLY

03:05:49.371 --> 03:05:51.940
WHAT IT IS NOW IS -- MAYBE I'M

03:05:52.007 --> 03:05:53.175
ASKING THE WRONG PERSON BUT IS

03:05:53.242 --> 03:05:54.042
PRETTY SHOCKING.

03:05:54.109 --> 03:05:56.311
YES WELL I DON'T THINK I'M NOT

03:05:56.378 --> 03:06:00.215
FOR THE WRONG PERSON.

03:06:00.282 --> 03:06:02.284
OKAY I'M I'M REALLY NOT PUBLIC

03:06:02.351 --> 03:06:03.919
HEALTH EXPERTS OR OR SAID -- IN

03:06:03.986 --> 03:06:05.454
THE S. P. D. WORLD I WILL SAY IN

03:06:05.521 --> 03:06:07.222
TALKING TO A LOT OF THE FOLKS

03:06:07.289 --> 03:06:07.923
WHO'VE BEEN GUIDING US ON THIS --

03:06:07.990 --> 03:06:08.891
THERE WAS A HUGE EPIDEMIC IN THE

03:06:08.957 --> 03:06:09.925
NINETEEN NINETIES AND IT TOOK A

03:06:09.992 --> 03:06:11.727
MAJOR INFUSION CASH TOWARDS THE

03:06:11.793 --> 03:06:13.462
END OF THAT -- INTO THAT DECADE

03:06:13.529 --> 03:06:14.830
I'M AND WE GOT IT DOWN THERE WAS

03:06:14.897 --> 03:06:16.632
THERE WAS A PLAN THAT -- IN THE

03:06:16.698 --> 03:06:17.799
NUMBER OF STDS THAT ARE JUST

03:06:17.866 --> 03:06:19.268
STARTED GOING BACK UP IN IN IN

03:06:19.334 --> 03:06:21.136
MAJOR WAYS THEY'RE JUST A LOT OF

03:06:21.203 --> 03:06:23.005
REASONS FOR BUT THE BOTTOM LINE

03:06:23.071 --> 03:06:24.306
IS THAT WE DON'T SPEND ENOUGH

03:06:24.373 --> 03:06:25.908
MONEY ON GOING MONEY.

03:06:25.974 --> 03:06:27.676
I MEAN BLESSED THE LEGISLATURE

03:06:27.743 --> 03:06:29.511
FOR APPROPRIATING TWO ONE TIME

03:06:29.578 --> 03:06:31.446
ONLY APPROPRIATIONS THE LAST

03:06:31.513 --> 03:06:32.781
THREE YEARS FIVE MILLION TWO MEN.

03:06:32.848 --> 03:06:34.383
THAT WAS HELPFUL BUT AS LONG AS

03:06:34.449 --> 03:06:36.184
YOU'RE ONLY PUTTING OUT ONE TIME

03:06:36.251 --> 03:06:38.220
ONLY FUNDING CAN ONLY PURCHASE

03:06:38.287 --> 03:06:40.122
STUFF WITH THE YOU CAN'T BUY ON

03:06:40.188 --> 03:06:41.223
GOING STAFFING GAUGE WHEN.

03:06:41.290 --> 03:06:42.224
IT'S JUST NOT DOING WHAT IT

03:06:42.291 --> 03:06:44.026
NEEDS TO DO -- WE NEED TO

03:06:44.092 --> 03:06:46.228
ACTUALLY INVEST I'M IN ONGOING

03:06:46.295 --> 03:06:52.734
FUNDS.

03:06:52.801 --> 03:06:55.304
I HOPE THAT WAS AN ANSWER.

03:06:55.370 --> 03:06:56.338
AND AND YOU MAY NOT HAVE THE

03:06:56.405 --> 03:06:57.139
ANSWER AND I HOPE THAT SOMEONE

03:06:57.205 --> 03:06:58.507
FROM PUBLIC HEALTH IS LISTENING

03:06:58.574 --> 03:06:59.174
UP OUT THERE THAT THAT MAYBE WE

03:06:59.241 --> 03:07:00.309
CAN GET SOME OF THIS INFORMATION

03:07:00.375 --> 03:07:01.677

03:07:02.311 --> 03:07:02.911
ABUSE.

03:07:02.978 --> 03:07:04.212
THAT'S BECAUSE HE KNOWS THE

03:07:04.279 --> 03:07:06.315
SPREAD HERE OR OR MEAN SURELY

03:07:06.381 --> 03:07:07.849
THERE IS SOME DATA OUT THERE

03:07:07.916 --> 03:07:09.318
SOMEWHERE THAT'S POINTED TO

03:07:09.384 --> 03:07:09.952
WHERE THE BECAUSE CAUSES ARE I

03:07:10.018 --> 03:07:11.553
WILL TELL YOU ONE OF THE BIGGEST

03:07:11.620 --> 03:07:12.754
CAUSES WE'VE SEEN JUST WITHIN

THE LAST DECADE.

03:07:13.622 --> 03:07:14.556

03:18:57.859 --> 03:18:59.427
DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY THE OPIOID

AND 48%.

03:19:12.540 --> 03:19:14.842
ALTHOUGH BLACKS ARE ONLY 6% OF

03:19:14.909 --> 03:19:16.177
THE CALIFORNIA POPULATION THEY

POPULATION WHERE WE KNOW THAT WE

03:19:30.825 --> 03:19:32.460
CAN CREATE.

03:19:32.527 --> 03:19:33.394
A HUGE IMPACT.

03:19:33.461 --> 03:19:35.129
WE'RE ASKING FOR IS FOR FIFTEEN

03:19:35.196 --> 03:19:36.064
MILLION DOLLARS TO CREATE

03:19:36.130 --> 03:19:38.066

03:19:38.132 --> 03:19:39.701
C. AMONG PEOPLE WHO USE DRUGS

03:19:39.767 --> 03:19:41.135

DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS AND

03:19:46.040 --> 03:19:47.241
UNFORTUNATELY HAD ENDED NOW.

03:19:47.308 --> 03:19:49.911
ON THEY TESTED OVER THIRTY FIVE

03:19:49.977 --> 03:19:51.245
THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS THEY FOUND

03:19:51.312 --> 03:19:54.282
A SEVEN POINT 5% POSITIVITY RATE.

03:19:54.349 --> 03:19:58.453
AND 95% OF THOSE WHO ARE LINKED

03:19:58.519 --> 03:19:59.253
TO CARE WERE CURED.

03:19:59.320 --> 03:20:01.189
IN ADDITION WE'RE ASKING FOR

03:20:01.255 --> 03:20:01.889

C. AND H. ID.

03:20:07.395 --> 03:20:09.464
AND WE KNOW IN THIS CASE THAT

03:20:09.530 --> 03:20:11.566
THE TWO DISEASES TOGETHER CREATE

03:20:11.632 --> 03:20:12.867
A CONDITION THAT WE'RE BOTH

03:20:12.934 --> 03:20:14.936
DISEASES ACT MORE AGGRESSIVELY

03:20:15.002 --> 03:20:16.871
AND THAT LEADS TO MUCH INCREASED

03:20:16.938 --> 03:20:18.473
MORE MORBIDITY.

03:20:18.539 --> 03:20:19.874

03:23:28.062 --> 03:23:29.063
SO THAT THE STATE IS NOT

03:23:29.130 --> 03:23:31.198
CONTINUE TO FALL FURTHER BEHIND.

03:23:31.265 --> 03:23:32.700

03:23:36.337 --> 03:23:37.872
I WILL SHARE THAT ONE OF THE

03:23:37.939 --> 03:23:40.641
CONCERNS IN THE INLAND EMPIRE IS

03:23:40.708 --> 03:23:41.375
THAT.

03:23:41.442 --> 03:23:43.544
MUCH OF THE FUNDING IS BASED ON

03:23:43.611 --> 03:23:47.048
THE DIAGNOSIS AND MANY OF THOSE

03:23:47.114 --> 03:23:48.616
WHO ARE AFFECTED TO GO TO PALM

03:23:48.683 --> 03:23:50.117

03:23:50.184 --> 03:23:51.552
TO LOS ANGELES.

03:23:51.619 --> 03:23:53.688
SO WHEN THERE'S AN EFFORT TO TRY

03:23:53.754 --> 03:23:55.590
TO DETERMINE HOW THE FUNDING IS

03:23:55.656 --> 03:23:56.991
GOING TO BE DONE.

03:23:57.058 --> 03:23:58.826
THE INLAND EMPIRE DOESN'T GET IT

03:23:58.893 --> 03:24:02.330
BECAUSE THE DIAGNOSIS WAS DONE

03:24:02.396 --> 03:24:04.532
OUTSIDE OF OF OUR DISTRICT.

03:24:04.599 --> 03:24:06.901

MY ENTIRE ABILITY TO ADDRESS ALL

03:30:55.943 --> 03:30:57.678
DISEASES IRRESPECTIVE OF WHAT

03:30:57.745 --> 03:30:59.613
THEY MIGHT BE.

03:30:59.680 --> 03:31:01.582
WITHOUT INVESTMENTS INTO OUR

03:31:01.648 --> 03:31:03.117
PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE

03:31:03.183 --> 03:31:04.618
LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS FRANKLY

03:31:04.685 --> 03:31:07.087

IN YOUR COMMENT YOU SAID TO

03:31:24.338 --> 03:31:27.841
REBUILD -- IS THAT.

HAD SIGNIFICANT CUTS -- OVER

03:31:35.049 --> 03:31:36.784
WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE AND WE

03:31:36.850 --> 03:31:39.353
USE THAT TWO THOUSAND TWO SAID --

03:31:39.420 --> 03:31:40.487
200-072-0008 AS A BASELINE

03:31:40.554 --> 03:31:42.389
BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY THE PERIOD

03:31:42.456 --> 03:31:42.856
RIGHT BEFORE THE GREAT

03:31:42.923 --> 03:31:44.658
DEPRESSION AND THAT'S WHEN WE

03:31:44.725 --> 03:31:47.061
SAW THAT IT DRAMATIC DECREASES

03:31:47.127 --> 03:31:48.796
IN REALIGNMENT DOLLARS -- AND

03:31:48.862 --> 03:31:50.497
I'D LIKE TO USE REALIGNMENTS

03:31:50.564 --> 03:31:52.866
BECAUSE THAT IS AN AREA OF

03:31:52.933 --> 03:31:53.901
FLEXIBLE FUNDING FOR LOCAL

03:31:53.967 --> 03:31:55.035
HEALTH DEPARTMENTS.

03:31:55.102 --> 03:31:56.770
IT'S WHAT WE USE IN ORDER TO

03:31:56.837 --> 03:31:57.871
CARRY OUT A LOT OF OUR CORE

03:31:57.938 --> 03:31:59.073
FUNCTIONS.

03:31:59.139 --> 03:32:01.075
I THINK ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT

03:32:01.141 --> 03:32:03.310
WE FACE IS OFTEN TIMES IF YOU

03:32:03.377 --> 03:32:04.812
SEE INCREASES.

03:32:04.878 --> 03:32:06.747
IN A FUNDING FOR LOCAL HEALTH

03:32:06.814 --> 03:32:08.315
DEPARTMENTS IT'S UNFORTUNATELY

03:32:08.382 --> 03:32:11.151
IT'S CATEGORICAL SO IT ALLOWS US

03:32:11.218 --> 03:32:12.886
TO ONLY ADDRESS A VERY SPECIFIC

03:32:12.953 --> 03:32:15.522
DISEASE -- IN A VERY SPECIFIC

03:32:15.589 --> 03:32:18.525
POPULATION WITH POSSIBLY A VERY

03:32:18.592 --> 03:32:20.527
UNIQUE INTERVENTION -- WE

03:32:20.594 --> 03:32:21.929
TYPICALLY OF USE REALIGNMENT

03:32:21.995 --> 03:32:23.097
THOUGH TO PERFORM ALL OF OUR

03:32:23.163 --> 03:32:25.032
CORE FUNCTIONS AND TO BE ABLE TO

03:32:25.099 --> 03:32:25.933
PIVOT.

03:32:25.999 --> 03:32:27.768
SO THAT WE CAN ADDRESS MEASLES

03:32:27.835 --> 03:32:30.170
AT ONE POINT -- HEPATITIS A

03:32:30.237 --> 03:32:31.705
HEPATITIS.

03:32:31.772 --> 03:32:36.043
C. ARE INCREASING RATES AND STDS

03:32:36.110 --> 03:32:37.010
AND THE LIKE.

03:32:37.077 --> 03:32:39.246
SO HAVE YOU HAVE YOU NOT SEEN --

03:32:39.313 --> 03:32:40.914
IMAGE DURING THE RECESSION WERE

03:32:40.981 --> 03:32:43.117
YOU WERE YOU WERE YOUR WAS YOUR

03:32:43.183 --> 03:32:44.985
LEVEL FUNDING CUT.

03:32:45.052 --> 03:32:46.620
SIGNIFICANTLY AND NOT SEEN.

03:32:46.687 --> 03:32:48.288
HAVE YOU NOT SEEN A RESTORATION --

03:32:48.355 --> 03:32:50.724
WE HAVE NOT SO AS WE'VE LOOKED

03:32:50.791 --> 03:32:52.893
AT A NINETEEN NINETY ONE HEALTH

03:32:52.960 --> 03:32:54.061
REALIGNMENT THAT'S THE ONE I'M

03:32:54.128 --> 03:32:56.063
SPECIFICALLY SPEAKING TO WHEN WE

03:32:56.130 --> 03:32:58.398
LOOK AT THE AVAILABLE THE

03:32:58.465 --> 03:32:58.932
NINETEEN NINETY ONE HEALTH

03:32:58.999 --> 03:33:00.968
REALIGNMENT DOLLARS -- FREE THE

03:33:01.034 --> 03:33:03.770
RECESSION AND WE COMPARE IT TO

03:33:03.837 --> 03:33:05.439
THE AVAILABLE DOLLARS TODAY WE

03:33:05.506 --> 03:33:07.808
HAVE NOT SEEN A RESTORATION OF

03:33:07.875 --> 03:33:09.843
THOSE DOLLARS.

03:33:09.910 --> 03:33:10.477
WOW.

03:33:10.544 --> 03:33:11.578
THAT'S PRETTY AND SO

03:33:11.645 --> 03:33:13.180
CONSEQUENTLY I BE THROUGH THE

03:33:13.247 --> 03:33:15.482
COURSE OF THE LAST TEN ELEVEN

03:33:15.549 --> 03:33:17.584
YEARS -- WHAT YOU'VE SEEN IS AND

03:33:17.651 --> 03:33:19.286
I SAY REBUILD BECAUSE WHAT

03:33:19.353 --> 03:33:21.855
YOU'VE SEEN IS A DEGRADATION?

03:33:21.922 --> 03:33:23.257
OF LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT

03:33:23.323 --> 03:33:26.059
CAPACITY TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS --

03:33:26.126 --> 03:33:27.561
SOME OF OUR CORE FUNCTIONS AND

03:33:27.628 --> 03:33:29.796
FRANKLY -- IT'S SOMETHING THAT

03:33:29.863 --> 03:33:32.232
YOU KNOW WE'RE THE ONLY ENTITY

03:33:32.299 --> 03:33:33.667
RESPONSIBLE FOR DOING THESE

03:33:33.734 --> 03:33:34.968
PARTICULAR THINGS IN OUR

03:33:35.035 --> 03:33:36.503
COMMUNITIES.

03:33:36.570 --> 03:33:39.973
SO WITH THIS FUNDING THEN BE --

03:33:40.040 --> 03:33:41.975
IN A WAY IT IS. TO FIND THE

03:33:42.042 --> 03:33:44.645
FUNDS THAT WOULD BE FLEXIBLE.

03:33:44.711 --> 03:33:46.380
FOR SO THAT INDIVIDUAL COUNTIES

03:33:46.446 --> 03:33:48.315
AND THEIR THEIR UNIQUE I MEAN

03:33:48.382 --> 03:33:49.583
THIS IS A DIVERSE STATE SO NOT I

03:33:49.650 --> 03:33:50.851
COUNTIES NEEDS ARE THE SAME

03:33:50.918 --> 03:33:52.686
EXACTLY -- TO GIVE YOU AN

03:33:52.753 --> 03:33:54.955
EXAMPLE I RECENTLY SAT WITH MY

03:33:55.022 --> 03:33:57.124
CHEMICAL DISEASE INVESTIGATORS.

03:33:57.191 --> 03:33:58.792
AND THE ISSUE THAT WE WERE

03:33:58.859 --> 03:34:00.527
SPEAKING TO WAS CONGENITAL

03:34:00.594 --> 03:34:03.397
SYPHILIS -- JUST SO YOU KNOW IN

03:34:03.463 --> 03:34:04.598
SUMMER DINO ARE CONGENITAL

03:34:04.665 --> 03:34:08.368
SYPHILIS RATES INCREASED BY 70%.

03:34:08.435 --> 03:34:11.438
BETWEEN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND

03:34:11.505 --> 03:34:12.339
TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE ISSUES THAT

03:34:12.406 --> 03:34:14.875
WE WERE DEALING WITH WERE A LOT

03:34:14.942 --> 03:34:16.777
OF WOMEN THAT WERE HOMELESS --

03:34:16.843 --> 03:34:18.579
AND A LOT OF WOMEN THAT WERE

03:34:18.645 --> 03:34:20.047
ALSO DRUG USING.

03:34:20.113 --> 03:34:22.382
AT THE SAME TIME -- JUSTIN THIS

03:34:22.449 --> 03:34:25.452
EARLY PART OF TWENTY NINETEEN WE

03:34:25.519 --> 03:34:27.921
SEE NINE HEPATITIS EIGHT CASES.

03:34:27.988 --> 03:34:30.290
SPREAD OUT THERE ARE TWENTY

03:34:30.357 --> 03:34:31.825
THOUSAND SQUARE MILES -- AT IN

03:34:31.892 --> 03:34:38.232
COMPARISON WE HAD TWELVE TOTAL

03:34:38.298 --> 03:34:40.067
HEPATITIS EIGHT CASES LAST YEAR --

03:34:40.133 --> 03:34:42.202
AND THEN AND TO TOP IT ALL OFF --

03:34:42.269 --> 03:34:42.970
WE ARE A KIND OF ON PINS AND

03:34:43.036 --> 03:34:43.770
NEEDLES RIGHT NOW I'M JUST

03:34:43.837 --> 03:34:45.305
WAITING TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT WE

03:34:45.372 --> 03:34:46.840
WILL END UP WITH THE MEASLES --

03:34:46.907 --> 03:34:49.276
CASE BECAUSE OF THE CASES THAT

03:34:49.343 --> 03:34:51.078
WE'RE SEEING IN ORANGE COUNTY.

03:34:51.144 --> 03:34:53.413
AND SO THE IDEA OF PROVIDING

03:34:53.480 --> 03:34:55.882
FLEXIBLE FUNDING IT WOULD GIVE

03:34:55.949 --> 03:34:57.818
ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO DIRECT

03:34:57.884 --> 03:34:59.186
STAFF OUT INTO THE FIELD TO

03:34:59.253 --> 03:35:00.654
ADDRESS THE CONGENITAL SYPHILIS

03:35:00.721 --> 03:35:03.090
CASE -- AT THE SAME TIME LOOK TO

03:35:03.156 --> 03:35:06.660
SEE HOW I CAN MITIGATE -- THE

03:35:06.727 --> 03:35:08.895
HEPATITIS EIGHT HOW IT CASES

03:35:08.962 --> 03:35:10.330
THAT I'VE GOT BUT ALSO

03:35:10.397 --> 03:35:12.199
CONSEQUENTLY BE PREPARED IN THE

03:35:12.266 --> 03:35:12.733
EVENT THAT I GET A MEASLES

03:35:12.799 --> 03:35:16.637
OUTBREAK -- WE I KNOW THE

03:35:16.703 --> 03:35:18.538
INCREASES IN VALLEY FEVER -- ARE

03:35:18.605 --> 03:35:20.340
AN ISSUE THAT HAS OCCURRED IN

03:35:20.407 --> 03:35:23.143
OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE AND SO.

03:35:23.210 --> 03:35:25.045
OUR REQUEST IS THAT THE FUNDING

03:35:25.112 --> 03:35:26.780
BE FLEXIBLE ENOUGH SO THAT

03:35:26.847 --> 03:35:28.248
INDIVIDUAL COMMUNITIES

03:35:28.315 --> 03:35:30.250
INDIVIDUAL COUNTIES.

03:35:30.317 --> 03:35:32.753
CAN ADDRESS THE SPECIFIC NEEDS

03:35:32.819 --> 03:35:34.788

SUPPORTIVE OF THIS REQUEST AND I

03:35:42.863 --> 03:35:44.998
THINK -- FOR ME THE IMPORTANCE

03:35:45.065 --> 03:35:47.034
IS THE FLEXIBILITY -- I

03:35:47.100 --> 03:35:48.235
REPRESENT A VERY DIVERSE

03:35:48.302 --> 03:35:50.304
DISTRICT AND WITHOUT THAT

03:35:50.370 --> 03:35:52.506
FLEXIBILITY THAT THE CATEGORY

03:35:52.572 --> 03:35:53.874
BECAUSE AS YOU DESCRIBED --

03:35:53.940 --> 03:35:55.876
DON'T HELP IN MANY IN MANY OF

THESE CASES BECAUSE OUR SOME OF

03:35:57.577 --> 03:35:59.179
THE COUNTIES MAY NOT HAVE.

IN STDS -- THIS IS THESE ARE THE

03:36:16.697 --> 03:36:17.731
KINDS OF THINGS THAT HAPPEN WE

03:36:17.798 --> 03:36:19.966
DON'T GO BACK AND RE FUND.

EARLY CHILDHOOD INITIATIVE AND

04:07:12.317 --> 04:07:15.253
SO BACK IN MARCH WE HAD RELEASE

04:07:15.320 --> 04:07:17.522

SCHEDULE IN WHICH WERE LOOKING

04:07:44.983 --> 04:07:46.918
TO INCREASE UTILIZATION IN THOSE

04:07:46.985 --> 04:07:47.752
AREAS.

04:07:47.819 --> 04:07:49.654
ALL CHILDHOOD VACCINES FOR TWO

04:07:49.721 --> 04:07:53.625
YEAR OLD SUPPORT LED SCREENING

AND DENTAL FLUORIDE VARNISH. FOR

04:07:55.193 --> 04:07:55.760
CHRONIC DISEASE MANAGEMENT WE

04:07:55.827 --> 04:07:56.962
IDENTIFIED CONTROLLING HIGH

04:07:57.028 --> 04:07:58.196
BLOOD PRESSURE SO TO THE

04:07:58.263 --> 04:07:59.831
TESTIMONY EARLIER AROUND

04:07:59.898 --> 04:08:02.367
HYPERTENSION PROGRAM -- DIABETES

04:08:02.434 --> 04:08:03.802

ADULT INFLUENCE OF VACCINES.

04:08:08.440 --> 04:08:09.741
AND THEN LASTLY -- THE ONE

04:08:09.808 --> 04:08:10.775
THAT'S PROBABLY THE MOST

04:08:10.842 --> 04:08:12.344
CHALLENGING FOR US THAT I THINK

04:08:12.410 --> 04:08:13.812
WE REALLY DO FEEL -- THERE'S A

04:08:13.878 --> 04:08:15.280
LOT OF OPPORTUNITY THERE IS

04:08:15.347 --> 04:08:15.814
AROUND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

04:08:15.880 --> 04:08:17.682
INTEGRATION -- SOME OF THE

04:08:17.749 --> 04:08:18.617
CHALLENGE IN THIS IS THAT

04:08:18.683 --> 04:08:20.085
THERE'S NOT A LOT OF CLINICAL

04:08:20.151 --> 04:08:21.219
MEASURES THAT HAVE BEEN

04:08:21.286 --> 04:08:22.988
DEVELOPED IN THIS AREA.

04:08:23.054 --> 04:08:24.022
BUT WE'RE LOOKING AT SCREENING

04:08:24.089 --> 04:08:25.323
FOR CLINICAL DEPRESSION

04:08:25.390 --> 04:08:26.358
MANAGEMENT OF DEPRESSION

04:08:26.424 --> 04:08:27.592
MEDICATION SCREENING FOR

04:08:27.659 --> 04:08:29.527
UNHEALTHY ALCOHOL USE AND THEN

04:08:29.594 --> 04:08:31.463
CO LOCATION OF PRIMARY CARE AND

04:08:31.529 --> 04:08:33.698
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES --

04:08:33.765 --> 04:08:35.000
THE RESPNSES WHEN WE RELEASED

04:08:35.066 --> 04:08:37.102
BOTH THESE PROPOSED MEASURES AS

04:08:37.168 --> 04:08:39.004
WELL AS THE TRAILER BILL WE GOT

04:08:39.070 --> 04:08:40.505
A LOT OF REALLY THOUGHTFUL

04:08:40.572 --> 04:08:42.907
FEEDBACK -- THERE WAS SOME

04:08:42.974 --> 04:08:45.377
ADDITIONAL -- ITEMS THAT WE

04:08:45.443 --> 04:08:47.679
THINK HAVE VALUE AND WILL MOST

04:08:47.746 --> 04:08:49.981
LIKELY BE -- MAKING SOME CHANGES

04:08:50.048 --> 04:08:50.849
THAT WILL BE REFLECTED IN THE

04:08:50.915 --> 04:08:52.217
GOVERNOR'S ME REVISIONS AROUND

04:08:52.284 --> 04:08:53.718
SOME OF THE MEASURE SO WE REALLY

04:08:53.785 --> 04:08:55.720
DO ACKNOWLEDGE -- SOME OF THE

04:08:55.787 --> 04:08:56.821
THOUGHTFUL FEEDBACK THAT WE GOT

04:08:56.888 --> 04:08:59.691
FROM STAKEHOLDERS ESPECIALLY

04:08:59.758 --> 04:09:01.126
AROUND CERTAIN CHRONIC DISEASES --

04:09:01.192 --> 04:09:02.961
AS IT PERTAINS TO THE TRAILER

04:09:03.028 --> 04:09:05.363
BILL PROPOSAL -- IT'S IT'S

04:09:05.430 --> 04:09:06.998
SOMETHING THAT WE WILL WANT TO

04:09:07.065 --> 04:09:08.667
HAVE FURTHER ONGOING DIALOGUE

04:09:08.733 --> 04:09:10.001
WITH BOTH THE STAKEHOLDERS BUT

04:09:10.068 --> 04:09:12.003
ALSO WE HAVE TO BACK INTO THESE

04:09:12.070 --> 04:09:13.571
PAYMENTS -- THROUGH OUR MANAGED

04:09:13.638 --> 04:09:15.240
CARE CAPITATION RATES SO WE

04:09:15.307 --> 04:09:16.808
DON'T HAVE DOLLAR AMOUNTS

04:09:16.875 --> 04:09:18.076
PROPOSED AT THIS TIME JUST

04:09:18.143 --> 04:09:20.445
BECAUSE WE STILL NEED TO KIND OF

04:09:20.512 --> 04:09:21.479
LOOK THROUGH THE DIFFERENT

04:09:21.546 --> 04:09:23.214
MEASURES THAT WE SETTLE ON AND

04:09:23.281 --> 04:09:25.817

OF FINANCIAL PAYMENT PROCESS

04:09:27.919 --> 04:09:28.887

HEALTH PLANS AND OUR ACTUARIES

04:09:30.588 --> 04:09:31.456
AND THEN THAT ALL HAS TO GET

04:09:31.523 --> 04:09:32.324
APPROVED.

04:09:32.390 --> 04:09:33.091
THROUGH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

04:09:33.158 --> 04:09:34.559
IS ATTRACTED PAYMENT SO THE

04:09:34.626 --> 04:09:35.960
TRAILER BILL REALLY DOES REFLECT

04:09:36.027 --> 04:09:37.262
SOME OF THE NEED FOR FEDERAL

04:09:37.329 --> 04:09:38.596
APPROVAL BUT ALSO KIND OF THE

MEDI CAL FUNDING.

04:26:19.463 --> 04:26:21.165
THIS WILL REPLACE THE CURRENT

AMADA PROGRAM -- THAT'S EXPIRING

04:26:23.767 --> 04:26:25.703
THIS YEAR THE AMOUNT OF PROGRAM

04:26:25.769 --> 04:26:27.104
IF YOU RECALL PLACED A FOUR

04:26:27.171 --> 04:26:28.305

OF THIS YEAR -- THE PROPOSAL --

04:26:36.313 --> 04:26:37.915
RE BASES.

04:26:37.981 --> 04:26:40.317
THE ERR AMBULANCE RATES TO BE

04:26:40.384 --> 04:26:42.353
THE EQUIVALENT OF THE RURAL

04:26:42.419 --> 04:26:43.887
MEDICARE RATE.

04:26:43.954 --> 04:26:45.689
WHICH REPRESENTS ROUGHLY -- TWO

04:26:45.756 --> 04:26:48.459
THIRDS OF THE ACTUAL ROCK ACOSTA

04:26:48.525 --> 04:26:49.727
PROVIDING THE SERVICE.

04:26:49.793 --> 04:26:51.195
THE REASON THIS IS SO NECESSARY

04:26:51.261 --> 04:26:53.664
IS THAT THE UNDERLYING BASE RATE

04:26:53.731 --> 04:26:55.766

REDUCED BY 10%.

04:27:07.077 --> 04:27:08.712
IN THAT TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN

04:27:08.779 --> 04:27:09.947
SO -- WITHOUT THE AMOUNT OF

04:27:10.013 --> 04:27:12.516
PROGRAM WE REVERT BACK TO

04:27:12.583 --> 04:27:13.817
NINETEEN NINETY THREE RATES --

04:27:13.884 --> 04:27:16.687
FINALLY AIR CARRIERS ARE -- ERR

EVEN THOUGH LIKE HOSPITALS ARE

04:27:32.836 --> 04:27:34.772
EVEN THOUGH UP 270% OF OUR

WITH THE HIGH COST DRUG?

04:38:00.930 --> 04:38:02.065
SO CURRENTLY WHEN A FEE FOR

INPATIENT BASIS THAT THE R. G.

04:38:22.118 --> 04:38:23.319
DOES NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE

04:38:23.386 --> 04:38:24.788
COST OF THE DRUG BECAUSE IT'S

04:38:24.854 --> 04:38:26.189
LOOKING AT THE AVERAGE COST.

04:38:26.256 --> 04:38:28.958

TO BE HOSPITALIZED.

04:38:36.833 --> 04:38:37.901
AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS THE

04:38:37.967 --> 04:38:39.602
REIMBURSEMENT DOESN'T TAKE INTO

04:38:39.669 --> 04:38:42.338

GET ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL WAS

04:39:12.836 --> 04:39:13.369
THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR

04:39:13.436 --> 04:39:14.404
LOSS TO THE HOSPITAL THE

04:39:14.471 --> 04:39:15.472
DEPARTMENT AGREED THAT THAT WAS

04:39:15.538 --> 04:39:17.207
UNACCEPTABLE THE AGREE TO CARVE

04:39:17.273 --> 04:39:19.476
THE DRUG OUT OF THE DRG PAYMENTS.

04:39:19.542 --> 04:39:21.344
ABOUT THAT PROCESS TOOK FIFTEEN

04:39:21.411 --> 04:39:22.345
MONTHS FROM THE MOMENT WE FIRST

04:39:22.412 --> 04:39:23.646
MENTIONED IT TO THE DEPARTMENT

04:39:23.713 --> 04:39:25.215
SO WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING.

04:39:25.281 --> 04:39:27.016
IS TO CREATE A DEFINITION OF A

04:39:27.083 --> 04:39:28.585
VERY HIGH COST DRUGS AND TO ASK

04:39:28.651 --> 04:39:30.353
THE DEPARTMENT JUST CREATE A

04:39:30.420 --> 04:39:31.721
PROCESS.

04:39:31.788 --> 04:39:32.622
TO GO AHEAD AND PROVIDE THESE

04:39:32.689 --> 04:39:34.124
CARVE OUTS IN THE FUTURE RATHER

04:39:34.190 --> 04:39:35.558
THAN WAITING FOR A STAKEHOLDER

04:39:35.625 --> 04:39:37.393
TO COMMON RAISE THE ISSUE -- SO

04:39:37.460 --> 04:39:38.561
THAT THAT HAPPENS FASTER AND YOU

04:39:38.628 --> 04:39:41.431
DON'T HAVE HOSPITAL'S

04:39:41.498 --> 04:39:41.998
EXPERIENCING THE LOSS IN THE

04:39:42.065 --> 04:39:45.401
MEANTIME.

04:39:45.468 --> 04:39:46.769
THANK YOU AND BUT NO DON'T GO

04:39:46.836 --> 04:39:48.638

PATTERSON DID HAVE.

04:39:52.942 --> 04:39:55.545
SOME COMMENTS THAT HE WANTED TO

04:39:55.612 --> 04:39:58.515
SHARE -- HE DID HAVE TO LEAVE.

04:39:58.581 --> 04:40:01.050
AND SO ON HIS BEHALF THESE ARE

04:40:01.117 --> 04:40:02.485
HIS WORDS OKAY.

04:40:02.552 --> 04:40:04.287
THEY'RE ALL GOOD WORDS BUT THESE

04:40:04.354 --> 04:40:06.923
ARE HIS WORDS -- MOST PATTERSON

04:40:06.990 --> 04:40:09.325

LOSSES IF WE DON'T CARVE OUT

04:40:15.498 --> 04:40:17.066

BE DOING IS TO PUT HOSPITALS IN

A POSITION WHERE THEY'RE

04:40:22.906 --> 04:40:24.574
FACTORING THE HIGH COST OF THESE

04:40:24.641 --> 04:40:25.542
DRUGS.

04:40:25.608 --> 04:40:27.143
WHEN DETERMINING IF THEY SHOULD

04:40:27.210 --> 04:40:28.211
ADMINISTER SOMETHING THAT IS

04:40:28.278 --> 04:40:30.713
POTENTIALLY LIFE SAVING TO A

COVERED BENEFIT STF IS A TOPICAL

04:41:29.439 --> 04:41:30.873
LIQUID AND THAT IS ESSENTIALLY

04:41:30.940 --> 04:41:32.609
PAINTED ON TEETH AND IT'S USED

04:41:32.675 --> 04:41:33.876

WAY TO TREAT DENTAL CARIES KNOWN

04:41:40.283 --> 04:41:41.751
AS CAVITIES AND IT CAN REDUCE

04:41:41.818 --> 04:41:43.853
THE NEED FOR FURTHER FILLINGS OR

04:41:43.920 --> 04:41:45.521
THE USE OF GENERAL ANESTHESIA.

04:41:45.588 --> 04:41:47.156
AND IT'S PARTICULARLY BENEFICIAL

04:41:47.223 --> 04:41:48.758
IN THE CARE OF PEOPLE

04:41:48.825 --> 04:41:50.793

IN ORDER TO REALLY FOCUS ON THE

04:41:56.332 --> 04:41:57.267
POPULATIONS THAT WOULD MOST

04:41:57.333 --> 04:41:58.935
BENEFIT FROM STF WE REALLY DID

04:41:59.002 --> 04:42:03.239
FOCUS ON THOSE POPULATIONS THAT

04:42:03.306 --> 04:42:04.107
I JUST LISTED.

04:42:04.173 --> 04:42:05.375
IT DOES LEAVE A DARK STAIN ON

04:42:05.441 --> 04:42:06.576
THE CAVITY -- AND THE I THINK

04:42:06.643 --> 04:42:07.343
THAT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW AND I

04:42:07.410 --> 04:42:08.811
CAN STAY IN THE STOP SOFT TISSUE

04:42:08.878 --> 04:42:10.780
LIKE THE GUMS TEMPORARILY WHICH

04:42:10.847 --> 04:42:12.148
IS WHY ALL OF OUR DENTIST USE

04:42:12.215 --> 04:42:13.683
I'M STRONG INFORMED CONSENT AND

04:42:13.750 --> 04:42:14.784
REALLY TALK THROUGH.

04:42:14.851 --> 04:42:16.185
SOME OF THE OPTIONS IT REALLY IS

04:42:16.252 --> 04:42:17.453
AN ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT THEY

04:42:17.520 --> 04:42:18.354
TALK TO THE OPTIONS WITH THEIR

04:42:18.421 --> 04:42:19.656
PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES TO

04:42:19.722 --> 04:42:21.391
MAKE SURE THEY UNDERSTAND.

04:42:21.457 --> 04:42:22.692
SORT OF WHT THEY'RE CHOOSING

04:42:22.759 --> 04:42:24.027
I'M IN DESPITE THE AESTHETIC

04:42:24.093 --> 04:42:25.295
CONCERNS IT'S REALLY BECOMING

04:42:25.361 --> 04:42:27.697
VERY WIDELY USED IN PRIVATE

04:42:27.764 --> 04:42:29.165
PRACTICE AND COMMERCIAL

04:42:29.232 --> 04:42:30.633
INSURANCE IS PAYING FOR IT.

04:42:30.700 --> 04:42:31.167
AND WHEN IT'S NOT COVERED

04:42:31.234 --> 04:42:32.635
FAMILIES ARE P. CHOOSING TO PAY

04:42:32.702 --> 04:42:34.837
OUT OF POCKET -- BECAUSE IT'S

04:42:34.904 --> 04:42:35.638
NOT COVERED BY MEDICARE ALL --

04:42:35.705 --> 04:42:36.873
IT MAYBE FINANCIALLY OUT OF

04:42:36.939 --> 04:42:38.341
REACH -- FOR FOR THOSE

04:42:38.408 --> 04:42:39.642
BENEFICIARIES.

04:42:39.709 --> 04:42:40.510
AND WE'RE REALLY HEARING FROM

04:42:40.576 --> 04:42:41.678
OUR MEMBER DENNIS THAT THEY'RE

PATIENTS AND IN A WIDE RANGE OF

04:42:44.847 --> 04:42:46.849
SETTINGS. ONE OF OUR DENTIST

04:42:46.916 --> 04:42:48.284
SAID RECENTLY THAT SHE USED IT

04:42:48.351 --> 04:42:50.153
I'M IN THE SAME DAY ON A TWO

04:42:50.219 --> 04:42:51.321
YEAR OLD AND A NINETY TWO YEAR

04:42:51.387 --> 04:42:52.322

04:42:52.388 --> 04:42:53.523
THE TWO YEAR OLD HAD A BABY

UPPER FRONT TEETH.

04:42:55.992 --> 04:42:57.393
AND WHILE HIS PARENTS WERE

04:42:57.460 --> 04:42:58.828
INITIALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE

04:42:58.895 --> 04:43:00.463
BLACK SIDE EFFECTS WHEN THEY

04:43:00.530 --> 04:43:02.332
REALLY CONSIDERED BOTH THE COST

04:43:02.398 --> 04:43:03.733
DIFFERENCE AS WELL AS AND

04:43:03.800 --> 04:43:05.168
ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT THE SORT

04:43:05.234 --> 04:43:06.302
OF TRADITIONAL TREATMENT.

04:43:06.369 --> 04:43:07.370
THAT WOULD HAVE INCLUDED IT

04:43:07.437 --> 04:43:09.372
NITROUS OXIDE GAS INJECTABLE

04:43:09.439 --> 04:43:10.907
ANESTHETICS AND POSSIBLY SERVE A

04:43:10.973 --> 04:43:13.376
TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE -- THE

04:43:13.443 --> 04:43:14.210
PARENTS DECIDED THAT I STAFF WAS

04:43:14.277 --> 04:43:15.645
REALLY THE THE WAY TO GO AND THE

04:43:15.712 --> 04:43:17.180
DENNIS IS GOING TO BE WORKING ON

04:43:17.246 --> 04:43:18.881
SORT OF AESTHETIC COVER UP SAYS

04:43:18.948 --> 04:43:21.117
AS HE HAS THE CHILD GETS OLDER.

04:43:21.184 --> 04:43:22.418
THE NINETY TWO YEAR OLD HAD

04:43:22.485 --> 04:43:24.954
DEMENTIA AND AND HAD DIFFICULTY

04:43:25.021 --> 04:43:26.389
KEEPING HIS TEETH CLEAN AGAIN

04:43:26.456 --> 04:43:28.057
SIMILAR DECISIONS WERE MADE TO

04:43:28.124 --> 04:43:29.659
SORT OF AVOID THAT THE

04:43:29.726 --> 04:43:31.828
DIFFICULTY OF COMPREHENSIVE

04:43:31.894 --> 04:43:37.967
TREATMENT -- AND SO.

04:43:38.034 --> 04:43:38.835
ESSENTIALLY THIS BUDGET ASK

04:43:38.901 --> 04:43:39.435
WOULD SIMPLY ALLOW THIS --

04:43:39.502 --> 04:43:40.436
ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT TO BE

04:43:40.503 --> 04:43:41.070
AVAILABLE FOR PATIENTS AND DONE

04:43:41.137 --> 04:43:41.704

PROPOSAL IN THE FINAL BUDGET.

04:43:44.507 --> 04:43:45.007
THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE

04:43:59.722 --> 04:44:00.623
GOOD EVENING MADAM CHAIR OF THE

04:44:00.690 --> 04:44:01.891
COUNCIL WITH CAL PACE WE

04:44:01.958 --> 04:44:03.459
REPRESENT THE PROGRAMS OF ALL

04:44:03.526 --> 04:44:05.395
INCLUSIVE CARE FOR THE ELDERLY --

04:44:05.461 --> 04:44:06.796
THIS PRO PROPOSAL WOULD MAKE

04:44:06.863 --> 04:44:08.197
CHANGES TO THE PAYMENT

04:44:08.264 --> 04:44:10.967
METHODOLOGY FOR PACE PROGRAMS --

04:44:11.033 --> 04:44:11.901
AS YOU KNOW PACES A

04:44:11.968 --> 04:44:14.370
COMPREHENSIVE CARE MODEL SERVING

04:44:14.437 --> 04:44:16.005
FOR ALL SENIORS AND OLDER ADULTS.

04:44:16.072 --> 04:44:18.007
IT ASSUMES -- THE ENTIRE RISK OF

04:44:18.074 --> 04:44:19.942
PROVIDING THE ALL THE SERVICES

04:44:20.009 --> 04:44:21.377
THAT THE SENIORS NEED TO STAY

04:44:21.444 --> 04:44:22.812
SAFE WHEN THE COMMUNITY SO THAT

04:44:22.879 --> 04:44:24.280
INCLUDES ACUTE CARE SERVICES AS

04:44:24.347 --> 04:44:27.450
WELL AS LONG TERM CARE SERVICES

04:44:27.517 --> 04:44:28.518
AND HOME CARE AND SO FORTH --

04:44:28.584 --> 04:44:30.386
THE PROPOSAL WOULD BETTER ALIGN

04:44:30.453 --> 04:44:32.355
THE METHODOLOGY WITH -- SOME OF

04:44:32.422 --> 04:44:34.257
THE UNIQUE ASPECTS OF PACE ONE

04:44:34.323 --> 04:44:35.558
IS THAT IT'S A VERY CAPITAL

04:44:35.625 --> 04:44:37.393
INTENSIVE PROGRAM THAT REQUIRES

04:44:37.460 --> 04:44:39.662
A LOT OF INVESTMENT ON THE FRONT

04:44:39.729 --> 04:44:41.731
END I PAY CENTER GENERALLY COST

04:44:41.798 --> 04:44:44.033
TEN MILLION DOLLARS OR MORE --

04:44:44.100 --> 04:44:45.501
TO START UP IN A COMMUNITY.

04:44:45.568 --> 04:44:46.869
AND THE CURRENT METHODOLOGY

04:44:46.936 --> 04:44:48.070
UNFORTUNATELY DOESN'T REALLY

04:44:48.137 --> 04:44:50.072
PROVIDE A MECHANISM TO RECOGNIZE

04:44:50.139 --> 04:44:51.541
THOSE COSTS AND ALLOW THEM TO BE

04:44:51.607 --> 04:44:53.476
RECOUPED IN A REASONABLE PERIOD

04:44:53.543 --> 04:44:54.177
OF TIME.

04:44:54.243 --> 04:44:55.812
THIS IS ALSO A VERY BALL LITTLE

04:44:55.878 --> 04:44:57.680
PROGRAM -- SERVING A FAIRLY

04:44:57.747 --> 04:44:59.916
SMALL NUMBER OF REALLY HIGH NEED --

04:44:59.982 --> 04:45:01.717
BENEFICIARIES SO -- THE PROGRAMS

04:45:01.784 --> 04:45:03.319
NEED A LITTLE BIT HIGHER MARGIN

04:45:03.386 --> 04:45:04.687
TO HANDLE THE SITUATION THAT

04:45:04.754 --> 04:45:06.022
ARISES WHEN.

04:45:06.088 --> 04:45:07.256
THEY HAVE A HIGHER THAN EXPECTED

04:45:07.323 --> 04:45:08.558
NUMBER OF CASES THAT ARE VERY

04:45:08.624 --> 04:45:10.193
EXPENSIVE SUCH AS HEPATITIS C.

04:45:10.259 --> 04:45:12.795
OR OR ORGAN TRANSPLANTS AND SO

04:45:12.862 --> 04:45:16.632
THE METHODOLOGY CHANGES WOULD

04:45:16.699 --> 04:45:17.233
ADDRESS THAT AND THEN WE ALSO

04:45:17.300 --> 04:45:17.700
HAVE.

04:45:17.767 --> 04:45:18.201
SOME PROBLEMS WITH THE

04:45:18.267 --> 04:45:19.135
METHODOLOGY RECOGNIZING THE

04:45:19.202 --> 04:45:22.071
ACTUAL COSTS OF STARTUP PROGRAMS --

04:45:22.138 --> 04:45:23.973
AND UNFORTUNATELY METHODOLOGY
