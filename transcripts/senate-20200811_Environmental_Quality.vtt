EXISTING SEPARATE EXEMPTION.

01:15:21.283 --> 01:15:23.085
WHAT THE TRADES ARE ASKING FOR

01:15:23.151 --> 01:15:24.453
IS THAT ALL OF THOSE PROJECTS

01:15:24.519 --> 01:15:26.388
THAT ARE CURRENTLY USING THOSE

01:15:26.455 --> 01:15:28.690
EXEMPTIONS NOW HAVE TO HAVE

01:15:28.757 --> 01:15:30.092

SKILL AND THE SKILLED WORKFORCE

01:15:32.261 --> 01:15:34.029
WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT. THE

01:15:34.096 --> 01:15:35.364
PERSON WHO RIGHT NOW IS

01:15:35.430 --> 01:15:37.065
BUILDING A FOUR PLEX WITH THEIR

01:15:37.132 --> 01:15:39.735

NEAR TRANSIT. WHICH WE DOES NOT

01:15:41.603 --> 01:15:42.638
HAVE ENTER INTO THAT KIND OF

01:15:42.704 --> 01:15:46.808
AGREE WOULD FOR FURTHER TO. USE

01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:53.382
AT RIGHT NOW FOR FREE FROM

01:15:53.448 --> 01:15:56.351
HAVING TO USE. THAT THAT A

01:15:56.418 --> 01:15:58.053
SKILLED WORKFORCE BECAUSE OF

01:15:58.120 --> 01:15:59.988
THEIR SIZE BECAUSE THEY DON'T

01:16:00.055 --> 01:16:01.123
USE ANY PUBLIC MONEY FOR

01:16:01.189 --> 01:16:02.791
WHATEVER REASON WOULD NO LNGER

01:16:02.858 --> 01:16:04.493
BE ABLE TO USE AN EXEMPTION

01:16:04.559 --> 01:16:05.928
THAT THEY COULD USE RIGHT NOW

01:16:05.994 --> 01:16:07.663
OR YESTERDAY OR LAST YEAR. SO

01:16:07.729 --> 01:16:09.665
THIS IS A VAST EXPANSION OF

01:16:09.731 --> 01:16:13.168
THAT REQUIRE. THERE'S NOTHING

01:16:13.235 --> 01:16:15.504
THAT STOPS THE BUILDING TRADES

01:16:15.570 --> 01:16:18.140
FROM THE GLACIATION. THOSE

01:16:18.206 --> 01:16:18.774
TERMS WITH DEVELOPERS AND THEY

01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:20.175
FREQUENTLY DO THAT IN THESE

01:16:20.242 --> 01:16:21.743
AREAS THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS

01:16:21.810 --> 01:16:23.578
BILL THAT RULES ANY OF THOSE

01:16:23.645 --> 01:16:25.514
PROTECTIONS FACT. SO I DON'T

01:16:25.580 --> 01:16:27.015
UNDERSTAND THE ARGUMENT ABOUT

01:16:27.082 --> 01:16:28.617
HOW THIS ROLLS WORKER

01:16:30.886 --> 01:16:33.455
MERELY WORKING WITH CURRENT

01:16:33.522 --> 01:16:38.160
EXEMPTIONS IN THE LAW. SO WE

01:16:38.226 --> 01:16:39.895
ARE OF COURSE MORE THAN HAPPY

01:16:39.962 --> 01:16:42.097

01:16:42.164 --> 01:16:43.532

AMENDMENTS FROM THEM IT'S VERY

01:16:58.914 --> 01:17:00.549
HARD FOR US TO BE ABLE TO

01:17:00.615 --> 01:17:04.019
RESPOND TO THIS OPPOSITION. SO

01:17:04.086 --> 01:17:04.953
I WOULD ASK THE COMMITTEE FOR

01:17:05.020 --> 01:17:06.121
