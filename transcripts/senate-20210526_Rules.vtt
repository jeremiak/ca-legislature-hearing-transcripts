00:11:19.612 --> 00:11:22.014
REASON THAT SHE WAS TAKEN

00:11:22.081 --> 00:11:24.583
BEFORE MY TIME TO BE PUT ON THE

PC AND I JUST FELT LIKE IT WAS

00:11:26.786 --> 00:11:31.857
IMPORTANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT.

00:11:31.924 --> 00:11:32.425
ARE AT THE BEGINNING BECAUSE

00:11:32.491 --> 00:11:33.726

00:11:43.335 --> 00:11:47.106

THEY WERE GIVEN THOSE FILES SO

00:12:06.859 --> 00:12:08.260
THEY HAVE THOSE POWERS BECAUSE

00:12:08.327 --> 00:12:10.396
A DIRECTLY ELECTED LEGISLATORS

00:12:10.463 --> 00:12:13.432

YOU'RE DOING THIS FROM THE

00:16:51.543 --> 00:16:53.379
STATEWIDE LEVEL WE DON'T

00:16:53.445 --> 00:16:55.147
COOPERATE THAT TO MAKE SURE

00:16:55.214 --> 00:16:56.148

KEY AS THE CASE MAY BE AT WITH

00:17:49.468 --> 00:17:49.835
REGARD TO DIFFERENT

00:17:49.902 --> 00:17:51.804
COMMUNITIES. THAT'S GIVEN US AN

00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:56.074
OPPORTUNITY TO- LEARN IT TOO

00:17:56.141 --> 00:17:59.244
AND WORKING THOSE COMMUNITIES-

00:17:59.311 --> 00:18:01.013
DEVELOP A COLLABORATIVE PROCESS

00:18:01.079 --> 00:18:03.582

00:18:13.125 --> 00:18:16.862
ENABLES US TO DO IS- REACH OUT

00:18:16.929 --> 00:18:19.765
TO THOSE COMMUNITIES AND- BUILD

00:18:19.832 --> 00:18:22.701
ON THOSE EXISTING RELATIONSHIPS-

00:18:22.768 --> 00:18:25.671
TO WORK ON THE SCOPING PLAN AND

00:18:25.737 --> 00:18:27.973
TO- AND TO HAVE ROBUST

00:18:34.146 --> 00:18:35.914
WE HOPE TO BUILD ON THOSE.

00:18:35.981 --> 00:18:37.649
EXISTING RELATIONSHIPS THAT

00:18:37.716 --> 00:18:38.617
HAVE DEVELOPED OVER THE LAST

00:18:38.684 --> 00:18:42.020
SEVERAL YEARS- AND REALLY GAIN

00:18:42.087 --> 00:18:43.522
SOME ROBUST INPUT INTO THE

00:18:43.589 --> 00:18:45.891
PLANNING PROCESS AND WHAT DO

00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:47.960
YOU THINK IS THE ROLE OF. OF

00:18:48.026 --> 00:18:49.027
NOW THAT THERE'S MORE OF A

00:18:49.094 --> 00:18:50.596
COMMUNITY BASED LOOK AS PART OF

00:18:50.662 --> 00:18:53.098
THE OVERALL PROCESS- WITH

00:18:53.165 --> 00:18:54.466
REGARD TO INCORPORATION OF

00:18:54.533 --> 00:18:57.002
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ADVOCATES

00:18:57.069 --> 00:18:59.605
SO- OBVIOUSLY SOME DO NOT FEEL

00:18:59.671 --> 00:19:01.640
HEARD IT IN VARIOUS CAR

00:19:01.707 --> 00:19:04.142

TO ASSIST IN THIS- WE'RE

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:44.049
LOOKING AT OPTIONS AROUND

00:19:44.116 --> 00:19:46.251
COMPETITION AND OTHER WAYS TO

00:19:46.318 --> 00:19:49.788

DO AND THIS IS GOING TO BE- AT

00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:07.906
AT- A LOT OF WORK FOR THEM AND

00:20:07.973 --> 00:20:09.241

I'M HOPING THAT- AT THE END OF

00:20:26.458 --> 00:20:27.693
THE DAY EVEN IF WE DON'T AGREE

00:20:27.759 --> 00:20:29.595

PLAN I SUSPECT OTHERS MAY WANT

00:20:40.238 --> 00:20:41.273
TO TALK ABOUT THAT BUT I'M

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:42.474
HAPPY TO HAVE INTRODUCED IT

00:20:42.541 --> 00:20:44.810
THAT WAY OF TWO MORE QUESTIONS

GOING TO HEAR FROM AND A BIT.

00:20:56.822 --> 00:20:57.322
ARE THE K. AND TRADE PROGRAM

00:20:57.389 --> 00:20:58.190
CAME UP AND IT WAS MENTIONED AT

00:20:58.256 --> 00:21:00.092
WASH. THE STATE OF WASHINGTON

00:21:00.158 --> 00:21:02.861
DECIDED TO CREATE ITS OWN CAP

00:21:02.928 --> 00:21:05.297
AND TRADE. AND IN DOING THAT

00:21:05.364 --> 00:21:06.698
THEY FELT LIKE THEY MADE

00:21:06.765 --> 00:21:08.734
CHANGES TO WHAT CALIFORNIA DOES

00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:10.535
BASED ON LEARNING FROM THE

00:21:10.602 --> 00:21:13.705
CALIFORNIA. EXPERIENCE THEN.

00:21:13.772 --> 00:21:14.973
THERE HAVE BEEN TWO

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:15.874
INTERESTINGLY THERE'S TWO

00:21:15.941 --> 00:21:17.175
DIFFERENT WAYS OF LOOKING AT

00:21:17.242 --> 00:21:20.412
THAT BECAUSE SOME. CRITICS SAY.

00:21:20.479 --> 00:21:22.414
OF THE AIRBOARD WAS INFLEXIBLE

00:21:22.481 --> 00:21:24.316
ABOUT MAKING THOSE CHANGES HERE

00:21:24.383 --> 00:21:26.351
IN WASHINGTON POINTED THEM OUT

00:21:26.418 --> 00:21:29.087
AND THEN CONVERSELY. THE OTHER

00:21:29.154 --> 00:21:31.790
SIDE OF THE COIN IS THAT-

00:21:31.857 --> 00:21:33.392
CALIFORNIA LEARNED AND WAS ABLE

00:21:33.458 --> 00:21:35.360
TO ADVISE WASHINGTON AND HOW TO

00:21:35.427 --> 00:21:36.862
INCORPORATE THOSE CHANGES AND

00:21:36.928 --> 00:21:38.764
IMPROVE THE CALIFORNIA SYSTEM

00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:40.799
HOW WOULD YOU. SORT OF SPEAK TO

00:21:40.866 --> 00:21:43.535
THAT COMPARISON BETWEEN

00:21:43.602 --> 00:21:45.637
WASHINGTON AND CALIFORNIA. I

00:21:45.704 --> 00:21:48.240
GUESS WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT-

00:21:48.306 --> 00:21:50.776
THE TAPESTRY PROGRAM IN

00:21:50.842 --> 00:21:52.778
CALIFORNIA HAS EVOLVED OVER

00:21:52.844 --> 00:21:57.082
TIME AND THE- AND THE- THAT

00:21:57.149 --> 00:21:58.717
SORT OF STRATEGIES WE HAVE

00:21:58.784 --> 00:22:00.018
DEPLOYED IN THE PROCESS NEEDS

00:22:00.085 --> 00:22:03.255
TO BE- UNDER GOD HAVE. EVOLVED

00:22:03.321 --> 00:22:05.791
OVER TIME- AND I THINK THAT'S

00:22:05.857 --> 00:22:09.928
APPROPRIATE- I THINK THERE WAS-

00:22:09.995 --> 00:22:14.099
THERE HAVE BEEN CHANGES TO- HOW

00:22:14.166 --> 00:22:15.901
TO HANDLE AND- SO FOR EXCESS

00:22:15.967 --> 00:22:17.836
ALLOWANCES THERE DID HE DIDN'T

00:22:17.903 --> 00:22:20.038
AND HOW TO HANDLE VARIOUS

00:22:20.105 --> 00:22:22.507
ASPECTS OF THE PROGRAM AND I

00:22:22.574 --> 00:22:25.444
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP-

00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:28.513
KEEP INVOLVING- I THINK ONE OF

00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:29.748
THE THINGS THAT WASHINGTON

00:22:29.815 --> 00:22:33.852
LEARNED PLACE TO CONSIDER-

00:22:33.919 --> 00:22:36.288
OPPORTUNITIES TO ADDRESS

00:22:36.354 --> 00:22:37.856
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE CAN TURN

00:22:37.923 --> 00:22:40.325
INTO THE BILL CAN A COMMUNITY

00:22:40.392 --> 00:22:42.294
AIR PROTECTION ASPECT. INTO

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:45.330
THEIR PROGRAM FROM THE- BUT IT

00:22:45.397 --> 00:22:49.634
IT'S- AND IT'S- PROPOSED AND I

00:22:49.701 --> 00:22:52.804
THINK THAT THAT IS. A TESTER

00:22:52.871 --> 00:22:55.140
TO- CALIFORNIA GROWING AND

00:22:55.207 --> 00:22:57.609
LEARNING AND BEING ABLE TO-

00:22:57.676 --> 00:22:59.611
SHARE AN IMPORTANT LESSONS

00:22:59.678 --> 00:23:02.280
LEARNED WITH OTHER STATE GOOD

00:23:02.347 --> 00:23:03.882
I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT I'M

00:23:03.949 --> 00:23:07.486
HOPING THAT. THAT WE CONTINUED

00:23:07.552 --> 00:23:10.355
TO ADAPT AND TAKE THOSE CHANGES

00:23:10.422 --> 00:23:12.023
INTO ACCOUNT LASTLY THE

00:23:12.090 --> 00:23:13.291
QUESTION THAT I SORT OF TEED UP

00:23:13.358 --> 00:23:15.293
AT THE BEGINNING. OR DO YOU

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:17.195
THINK WITH ALL THE EMPHASIS ON

00:23:17.262 --> 00:23:19.831
CLIMATE THE DEER BORDERS PAYING

00:23:19.898 --> 00:23:22.334
ENOUGH ATTENTION TO AIR QUALITY

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:24.336
ISSUES WHICH WERE ESSENTIALLY

00:23:24.402 --> 00:23:26.538
ITS ORIGINAL CHARGE WHEN IT GOT

00:23:26.605 --> 00:23:31.243
OFF THE GROUND. YES I DO I

00:23:31.309 --> 00:23:34.179
THINK THAT YOU KNOW HIGHER HAS

00:23:34.246 --> 00:23:35.981
WORKED HARD TO ADDRESS- AIR

00:23:36.047 --> 00:23:38.617
QUALITY ATTACKS OVER THE YEARS-

00:23:38.683 --> 00:23:40.519
AND HAS HAS ALWAYS DONE SO IF

00:23:40.585 --> 00:23:41.920
YOU CAN YOU TO DO SO AS I

00:23:41.987 --> 00:23:43.155
MENTIONED IN MY OPENING

00:23:51.496 --> 00:23:52.931
GOOD RESULTS AND HAVE BEEN VERY

00:23:52.998 --> 00:23:55.767
EFFECTIVE- AND WE CONTINUE TO

BREAKING LOW NOT CONDITIONS

LEADERSHIP. AND THERE WAS A

00:29:45.583 --> 00:29:49.554
CONCERN ABOUT THE- THERE WASN'T

00:29:49.621 --> 00:29:51.156
A DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY

00:29:51.222 --> 00:29:53.224

RECOMMENDATIONS. SO I THE

00:29:59.197 --> 00:30:02.267
QUESTION TO YOU IS WOULD YOU BE

00:30:02.333 --> 00:30:04.068
MORE WILLING TO HAVE LET'S SAY

00:30:04.135 --> 00:30:06.037
OUR TECHNICAL SUBCOMMITTEES

00:30:06.104 --> 00:30:08.106
THAT NEED MORE LIKE WHAT GOES

00:30:08.173 --> 00:30:11.676
ON OUT OF. OUR OTHER BOARDS.

00:30:11.743 --> 00:30:13.411
CANCEL THAT IT'S NOT FULL

00:30:13.478 --> 00:30:15.480
CENTRALIZED BUT IT'S MORE

00:30:15.547 --> 00:30:17.315
COLLABORATIVE AND SHE LOOK AT.

THAT MIGHT BE NECESSARY AND I

00:30:34.766 --> 00:30:36.334
THINK THAT THAT GOES TO THE

00:30:36.401 --> 00:30:39.204
CREDIBILITY AND THE- CONFIDENCE

00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:39.938

A OR B. TWO ABOUT EVALUATE

00:35:02.533 --> 00:35:04.802
PHASING OUT OIL AND GAS AND-

00:35:04.869 --> 00:35:05.736
YOU'RE A COMING SCHOOL BEING

00:35:05.803 --> 00:35:08.473
PLANNED AT THE END OF TWO

00:35:08.539 --> 00:35:09.040
THOUSAND EIGHTEEN UNDER THE

ROWN ADMINISTRATION YOUR

00:35:10.074 --> 00:35:12.009
AGENCY FOUND THAT REASON

00:35:12.076 --> 00:35:13.411
RESTRICTING OIL AND GAS

00:35:13.478 --> 00:35:15.480
PRODUCTION CALIFORNIA. COULD

00:35:15.546 --> 00:35:17.615
ALSO RESULT IN THE COST OF A

00:35:17.682 --> 00:35:19.083
REGIONAL AND LOCAL ECONOMIES

00:35:19.150 --> 00:35:20.618
BEING AFFECTED INCLUDING LOSS

00:35:20.685 --> 00:35:22.620
OF EMPLOYMENT AND TAX REVENUE

00:35:22.687 --> 00:35:24.555
VITAL TO PROVIDING ESSENTIAL

00:35:24.622 --> 00:35:25.990
PUBLIC SERVICES ACROSS THE

00:35:26.057 --> 00:35:29.060
STATE- FOR INSTANCE KERN COUNTY

00:35:29.126 --> 00:35:30.862
NOT ONLY PRODUCES 70% OF THE

00:35:30.928 --> 00:35:32.964
STATE'S OIL THAT IS CONSUMED BY

00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:35.199
ALL CALIFORNIANS. BUT IT ALSO

00:35:35.266 --> 00:35:37.668
PRODUCES 51% OF THE SOLAR THAT

00:35:37.735 --> 00:35:39.203
IS CONSUMED BY ALL OF

00:35:39.270 --> 00:35:40.838
CALIFORNIANS IN VERY FEW PEOPLE

00:35:40.905 --> 00:35:42.907
KNOW THAT BUT OUR SOLAR ISN'T

00:35:42.974 --> 00:35:44.609
NORTH AND SOUTH EVEN THOUGH USE

00:35:44.675 --> 00:35:46.978
YOUR LAND OUR LAND TIP- PRODUCE

00:35:47.044 --> 00:35:49.247
THE SOLAR. ELECTRICITY THAT

00:35:49.313 --> 00:35:53.384
HELPS MEET THE GREENHOUSE. GAS

00:35:53.451 --> 00:35:54.085
EMISSION REDUCTION GOALS. AND

00:35:54.151 --> 00:35:54.852
THE PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE IS

00:35:54.919 --> 00:35:56.120
WITH OUR OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY

00:35:56.187 --> 00:35:57.555
THEY PAY LOCAL TAXES WHERE WE

00:35:57.622 --> 00:35:59.156
CAN TAKE CARE OF FIREFIGHTERS

00:35:59.223 --> 00:36:01.392
SCHOOL DISTRICTS. LIBRARIES

00:36:01.459 --> 00:36:03.327
THINGS LIKE THAT- OUR SOLAR

00:36:03.394 --> 00:36:06.130
COMPANIES DON'T PAY LOCAL TAXES

00:36:06.197 --> 00:36:07.698
AND WE LOSE ABOUT TWENTY

00:36:07.765 --> 00:36:11.002
MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. AND IN.

00:36:11.068 --> 00:36:14.138
MANY THAT'S USED TO BENEFIT OUR

00:36:14.205 --> 00:36:16.707
COMMUNITY EVEN THOUGH WE- WE

00:36:16.774 --> 00:36:18.242
PRODUCE 51% OF THE STATE'S

00:36:18.309 --> 00:36:20.478
SOLAR WE GET NO BENEFIT FROM

00:36:20.545 --> 00:36:22.747
THAT. SO I'M WONDERING IF- YOU

00:36:22.813 --> 00:36:24.615
ANTICIPATE THE FINDINGS FROM

00:36:24.682 --> 00:36:26.284
YOUR RESEARCH REPORT DID THEY

00:36:26.350 --> 00:36:28.686
CHANGE. AND WILL YOU RELY ON

00:36:28.753 --> 00:36:31.389
THE PREVIOUS ANALYSIS WE TAKE

00:36:31.455 --> 00:36:32.323
INTO CONSIDERATION COMMUNITIES

00:36:32.390 --> 00:36:34.292
LIKE MINE. THAT LIKE I SAID

00:36:34.358 --> 00:36:36.928
PRODUCE 70% OF THE STATE'S OIL

00:36:36.994 --> 00:36:38.763
IT HELPS US PREVENT OIL FROM

00:36:38.829 --> 00:36:40.898
BEING SHIPPED IN FROM ECUADOR

00:36:40.965 --> 00:36:44.235
NICARAGUA. VENEZUELA I MEAN ALL

00:36:44.302 --> 00:36:45.303
THESE OTHER PLACES THAT WE HAVE

00:36:45.369 --> 00:36:46.771
OIL SHIPPED IN BECAUSE OUR

00:36:46.837 --> 00:36:48.472
CONSUMPTION HASN'T GONE DOWN.

00:36:48.539 --> 00:36:50.441
AND AGAIN OUR COMMUNITY

00:36:50.508 --> 00:36:52.376
PRODUCES 51% OF THE SOLAR BUT

00:36:52.443 --> 00:36:54.345
WE GET NO CREDIT FOR IT SO. I

00:36:54.412 --> 00:36:56.247
GUESS MY GOING BACK TO THE

00:36:56.314 --> 00:36:57.415
EXACT QUESTION IS DO YOU

00:36:57.481 --> 00:36:58.549
ANTICIPATE FINDINGS FROM A

00:36:58.616 --> 00:37:00.084
RECENT REPORT TO HAVE CHANGED-

00:37:00.151 --> 00:37:01.185
WE RELY ON YOUR PREVIOUS

00:37:01.252 --> 00:37:05.389
ANALYSIS. IS THEIR DIFFERENCES

00:37:05.456 --> 00:37:05.856
AND HOW DO YOU PLAN TO

00:37:05.923 --> 00:37:09.193
RECONCILE THEM. SO WE WILL AND

00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:10.194
WE WILL LOOK AT PREVIOUS

00:37:10.261 --> 00:37:11.696
ANALYSES THAT HAVE BEEN DONE

00:37:11.762 --> 00:37:16.567
AND- AND- MORE CURRENT ANALYSIS

00:37:16.634 --> 00:37:18.069
THAT AND HAS BEEN DONE MORE

00:37:18.135 --> 00:37:21.038
RECENTLY AND- AND I'LL-

00:37:21.105 --> 00:37:25.509
RELEVANT AND- AS THAT. IT IS

00:37:25.576 --> 00:37:27.612
ECONOMIC AND TECHNICAL ANALYSIS

00:37:27.678 --> 00:37:28.813
THAT WE CAN IS KIND OF THE

00:37:28.879 --> 00:37:30.114
SHORT AFTER YOU KNOW WE ALWAYS

00:37:30.181 --> 00:37:32.583
WANT TO MAKE SURE WE ARE AND-

00:37:32.650 --> 00:37:34.251
GATHERING THE BEST DATA- TO

00:37:34.318 --> 00:37:37.455
HELP US DO THIS WORK- IN THE IN

00:37:37.521 --> 00:37:38.689
THE PLAN ITSELF WE WILL BE

00:37:38.756 --> 00:37:41.592
ANALYZING- PURSUANT TO THE- THE

00:37:41.659 --> 00:37:44.028
GOVERNOR'S REQUEST- IT.

00:37:44.095 --> 00:37:46.697
STRATEGIES AROUND- GETTING TO

00:37:46.764 --> 00:37:48.499
CARBON NEUTRALITY BY PACOLLI

00:37:48.566 --> 00:37:51.235
BOTH SUPPLY AND DEMAND CAN YOU

00:37:51.302 --> 00:37:53.204
RAISE THE KEY ISSUE IN YOUR

00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:56.674
QUESTION ABOUT- CONCEPTION- AND

00:37:56.741 --> 00:37:57.908
SO I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE

00:37:57.975 --> 00:37:59.877
VERY IMPORTANT STEPPING PLAN

00:37:59.944 --> 00:38:03.414
TO- ANALYZE WAYS THAT WE CAN

00:38:03.481 --> 00:38:05.716
ACHIEVE CARBON NEUTRALITY BOTH

00:38:05.783 --> 00:38:09.587
LOOKING AT SUPPLY AND DEMAND-

00:38:09.654 --> 00:38:11.288
SO THAT WE CAN UNDERSTAND WAYS

00:38:11.355 --> 00:38:13.224
THAT WE CAN TRANSITION AWAY

00:38:13.290 --> 00:38:15.893
FROM FOSSIL FUELS IN- IN OUR

00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:17.762
VARIOUS ACTIVITIES WITHIN THE

00:38:17.828 --> 00:38:20.531
STATE- SO WILL BE ANALYZING-

00:38:20.598 --> 00:38:23.000
YOU KNOW BOTH OF THOSE STATES-

00:38:23.067 --> 00:38:28.439
VERY THOROUGHLY AND- AND WE

00:38:28.506 --> 00:38:29.040
WILL CERTAINLY BE LOOKING AT.

00:38:29.106 --> 00:38:31.208
ECONOMIC AND- THAT THEIR TAX BY

00:38:31.275 --> 00:38:34.045
UP. THANK YOU I THANK YOU VERY

00:38:34.111 --> 00:38:35.846
MUCH. TO ASK YOU A FEW

00:38:35.913 --> 00:38:36.847
QUESTIONS IF YOU DON'T MIND ON

00:38:36.914 --> 00:38:38.683
TRANSPORTATION AND IN GHG

00:38:38.749 --> 00:38:41.952
EMISSIONS- I HOPE THAT'S OKAY.

00:38:42.019 --> 00:38:43.054
SO WHAT FACTORS ARE YOU GONNA

00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:44.555
CONSIDER WHEN EVALUATING THE

00:38:44.622 --> 00:38:45.690
EFFECTIVENESS OF CLIMATE CHANGE

00:38:45.756 --> 00:38:47.491
POLICIES SCIENCE BASED

00:38:47.558 --> 00:38:49.827
COLLECTIVE LIKE I EVEN- SCIENCE

00:38:49.894 --> 00:38:50.928
BASED ARE COST EFFECTIV

00:38:50.995 --> 00:38:52.530
REGULATIONS TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL

00:38:52.596 --> 00:38:55.366
MARKET BASED STRATEGIES. TO

00:38:55.433 --> 00:39:00.538
REDUCE M. GHG- SO WE- WILL BE

00:39:00.604 --> 00:39:04.475
RELYING ON- AS MUCH AS AT

00:39:04.542 --> 00:39:06.377
MODELING AND ANALYSIS AS WE CAN

00:39:06.444 --> 00:39:09.847
WITH REGARDS TO UNDERSTANDING-

00:39:09.914 --> 00:39:11.382
WHAT EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS WE

00:39:11.449 --> 00:39:13.250
WILL BE ACHIEVING- THROUGH

00:39:13.317 --> 00:39:16.854
VARIOUS STRATEGIES. AND HOW AND

00:39:16.921 --> 00:39:19.724
IT. DEPLOYING ARE

00:39:19.790 --> 00:39:21.992
TRANSPORTATION GOLD IN ALL OF

00:39:22.059 --> 00:39:23.027
OUR SECTORS THE HEAVY DUTY

00:39:23.094 --> 00:39:25.062
SECTOR THE LIKE THE SECTOR OFF

00:39:25.129 --> 00:39:27.498
ROAD- YOU KNOW WHAT ARE THEIR

00:39:27.565 --> 00:39:29.967
STRATEGIES- THAT WILL REDUCE

00:39:30.034 --> 00:39:32.937
GHG EMISSIONS REDUCTION- WILL

REGULATORY PROCESSES. THAT WERE

00:41:32.289 --> 00:41:35.326
INSTITUTED IN POLICY. BUT

THEY'RE STRUGGLING NOW YOU KNOW

00:41:36.961 --> 00:41:38.662
THEY HAVE TO REPLACE VEHICLES

00:41:38.729 --> 00:41:40.898

00:41:40.965 --> 00:41:42.333
YEARS OLD IN THIS EQUIPMENT WAS

00:41:42.399 --> 00:41:46.203

JENNER THAT YOU KNOW IF FOUR

00:41:49.506 --> 00:41:50.341
THOUSAND OUR PIECE OF EQUIPMENT

00:41:50.407 --> 00:41:52.076
IT SHOULD LAST TWENTY YEARS NOT

00:41:52.142 --> 00:41:53.010
FOUR YEARS. IN THE STATE OF

00:41:53.077 --> 00:41:55.346
CALIFORNIA. SO AND THEN OF

00:41:55.412 --> 00:41:58.949

SAFELY AND ENVIRONMENTALLY

00:42:03.087 --> 00:42:04.755
FRIENDLY. IN THE MOST

00:42:04.822 --> 00:42:05.656
RESTRICTIVE ENVIRONMENTAL

00:42:05.723 --> 00:42:07.725
QUALITY EVER AND WE'RE GONNA

00:42:07.791 --> 00:42:08.626
GET IT FROM OTHER COUNTRIES

00:42:08.692 --> 00:42:09.793
WHERE THEY DON'T HAVE THE SAME

00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:10.961
ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES AND BRING

00:42:11.028 --> 00:42:11.862
IT OVER HER BY BUNKER FUEL

00:42:11.929 --> 00:42:13.931
WHICH- CAUSES MORE GEE SHEEN IN

00:42:13.998 --> 00:42:16.000
ANYTHING EVER- PRODUCED

00:42:16.066 --> 00:42:18.802
INCLUDING DIESEL TRACKS. M. SO

00:42:18.869 --> 00:42:20.504
GOING TO CAP AND TRADE BASED ON

00:42:20.571 --> 00:42:22.573
THAT COMMENT AND I'M SORRY FOR

00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:24.808
THAT LEGALLY COMMENT AND- GOING

TO CAP AND TRADE. IN YOUR VIEW

00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:30.080
WHAT THE WHAT WHAT HOW LARGE OF

00:42:30.147 --> 00:42:31.515
A ROLE DO YOU THINK THAT CAP

00:42:31.582 --> 00:42:34.385
AND TRADE PROGRAMS. HAVE A TV

00:42:34.451 --> 00:42:36.787
IN THE STATE'S CLIMATE GOALS.

00:42:36.854 --> 00:42:38.289
SO THAT IS A KEY ISSUE WILL BE

00:42:38.355 --> 00:42:39.623
WE WILL BE LOOKING AT IN THE

00:42:39.690 --> 00:42:42.493
SCRIPTING PLAN IN TERMS OF-

00:42:42.559 --> 00:42:44.995
UNDERSTANDING- WHAT ARE

00:42:45.062 --> 00:42:46.730
DIFFERENT STRATEGIES ARE AND

00:42:46.797 --> 00:42:48.832
HOW MUCH- EMISSIONS REDUCTION

00:42:48.899 --> 00:42:50.968
WE CAN ACHIEVE. WITH EACH

00:42:51.035 --> 00:42:53.137
STRATEGY THAT WILL BE A KEY

00:42:53.203 --> 00:42:56.106
FOCUS OF THE ANALYSIS IN THE

00:42:56.173 --> 00:42:58.042
UPCOMING SKIPPING PLAN. OKAY DO

00:42:58.108 --> 00:42:58.943
YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON HOW

00:42:59.009 --> 00:43:00.678
CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM- COULD BE

00:43:00.744 --> 00:43:08.052
IMPROVED. I THINK THAT. THERE

00:43:08.118 --> 00:43:10.154
ARE AS AND I WAS MENTIONING

00:43:10.220 --> 00:43:11.221
EARLIER MAYBE LIKE YOU RAN YOUR

00:43:11.288 --> 00:43:14.825
OTHER HEARING AND HE HAD A CAP

00:43:14.892 --> 00:43:17.528
AND TRADE STRUCTURE AND- THE

00:43:17.594 --> 00:43:18.429
REGULATORY STRUCTURE GOES WITH

00:43:18.495 --> 00:43:22.466
IT HAS EVOLVED OVER THE YEARS-

00:43:22.533 --> 00:43:25.803
RIGHT NOW AND WE ARE SORT OF

00:43:25.869 --> 00:43:28.605

00:43:28.672 --> 00:43:30.174
RECENTLY MADE CHANGES IN

00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:33.677
RESPONSE TO LEGISLATION- AND SO

00:43:33.744 --> 00:43:35.612
THAT THOSE CHANGES- HAVE

00:43:35.679 --> 00:43:38.082

WE'RE UNDERTAKING ARE SCOPING

00:43:39.683 --> 00:43:41.452
PLAN ANALYSIS. AND THEN AFTER

00:43:41.518 --> 00:43:44.555
THAT- YOU KNOW I THINK WE WOULD

00:43:44.621 --> 00:43:46.623
HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE

00:43:46.690 --> 00:43:48.459

FIRST CHAT WITH YOU WHEN YOU

00:46:21.111 --> 00:46:24.181

YOURSELF BUT- THERE HAVE BEEN A

00:46:51.842 --> 00:46:53.043
COUPLE OF CRITICISMS THAT HAVE

BEEN LEVIED- AT CAR PROBABLY

00:46:56.113 --> 00:46:56.847
MORE THAN TWO BUT I'LL JUST

00:46:56.914 --> 00:47:00.984

THAT ADDRESS. AIR POLLUTION

HERE- IN OUR COMMUNITY IN

00:47:57.107 --> 00:48:00.310
CALIFORNIA- WE BY FAR MOST OF

00:48:00.377 --> 00:48:02.012
OUR EMPLOYEES AT THE AGENCY

WORK ON- THOSE KIND OF BREAD

00:48:04.648 --> 00:48:08.118
AND BUTTER- AIR QUALITY ISSUES-

00:48:08.185 --> 00:48:09.586

FERRIES TO OPERATE EQUIPMENT-

00:48:21.565 --> 00:48:23.900
BOTH I REGULATORY PROGRAMS AND

00:48:23.967 --> 00:48:24.801
OUR INCENTIVE PROGRAMS ARE

00:48:24.868 --> 00:48:28.705
REALLY- INTENDED TO REDUCE-

00:48:28.772 --> 00:48:31.842
OZONE AND PARTICULATE MATTER-

00:48:31.908 --> 00:48:35.112

THE PAYMENT IN CALIFORNIA AND

00:48:38.649 --> 00:48:44.588
THAT CONTINUES. TO BE A KEY

00:48:44.655 --> 00:48:45.689
FOCUS AND IT'S ALSO SOMETHING

00:48:45.756 --> 00:48:48.725
THAT I FEEL- I CAN THAT. AB

00:48:48.792 --> 00:48:49.459
SPEND MORE TIME CAP ABOUT AND A

00:48:49.526 --> 00:48:50.727
LITTLE MORE TIME HIGHLIGHTING

00:48:50.794 --> 00:48:52.729
BECAUSE I REALLY DON'T WANT

00:48:52.796 --> 00:48:54.865
WANT FOLKS TO FORGET THAT THAT

00:48:54.931 --> 00:48:58.602
WORK IS HAPPENING- WHICH REGARD

00:48:58.669 --> 00:49:03.006
TO AND- THAT YOU KNOW THAT

00:49:03.073 --> 00:49:06.943
STAFF AND THE BOARD I THINK- WE

00:49:07.010 --> 00:49:11.181
ARE AT A VERY LARGE BOARD AND-

00:49:11.248 --> 00:49:14.918
AND WE HAVE. A LOT OF EXPERTISE

00:49:14.985 --> 00:49:16.720
THAT WE ARE ABLE TO TAKE

00:49:16.787 --> 00:49:19.523
ADVANTAGE AS- AND I THINK ONE

00:49:19.589 --> 00:49:21.725
OF MY GOALS AS CHAIR IS TO MAKE

00:49:21.792 --> 00:49:24.995
SURE THAT BOARD MEMBERS HAVE.

00:49:25.062 --> 00:49:27.431
ACCESS TO ALL THE INFORMATION

00:49:27.497 --> 00:49:29.199
THAT THEY NEED TO MAKE

00:49:29.266 --> 00:49:31.501
DECISIONS THAT. BASS MAKE

00:49:31.568 --> 00:49:33.603
THEMSELVES AVAILABLE TO PROVIDE

00:49:33.670 --> 00:49:37.074
THREE THINGS- AND TAKE INPUT.

00:49:37.140 --> 00:49:39.109
FROM BOARD MEMBERS AND SO I

00:49:39.176 --> 00:49:40.444
HOPE THAT IF ANY BOARD MEMBERS

00:49:40.510 --> 00:49:41.912
FEEL LIKE THAT'S NOT HAPPENING

00:49:41.978 --> 00:49:43.847
THAT THEY WILL REACH OUT TO ME.

00:49:43.914 --> 00:49:47.084
AND I'LL BE HAPPY TO TRY TO

00:49:47.150 --> 00:49:48.685
INTERVENE AND MAKE SURE THINGS

00:49:48.752 --> 00:49:51.188
RUN MORE SMOOTHLY- BUT I ALSO

00:49:51.254 --> 00:49:53.423
THINK THAT. WE HAVE AN

00:49:53.490 --> 00:49:56.126
OPPORTUNITY IN OUR MONTHLY AND

00:49:56.193 --> 00:49:57.761
CONTAINS MORE THAN MONTHLY

00:49:57.828 --> 00:50:01.198
MEETINGS Q. AND- REALLY MAKE

00:50:01.264 --> 00:50:02.199
SURE THAT BOARD MEMBERS HAVE AN

00:50:02.265 --> 00:50:04.167
OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE THEIR

00:50:04.234 --> 00:50:05.969
THOUGHTS AND SHARE THEIR

00:50:06.036 --> 00:50:08.939
LEADERSHIP. IT'S CHALLENGING

00:50:09.005 --> 00:50:12.709
BECAUSE- AND- WHEN YOU HAVE A

00:50:12.776 --> 00:50:14.177
LOT OF DIFFERENT MEMBERS THEY

00:50:14.244 --> 00:50:15.145
HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS

00:50:15.212 --> 00:50:18.682
TO YOU. AND AND SO IT WOULD BE

00:50:18.749 --> 00:50:20.283
DIFFICULT IF BOARD MEMBERS WERE

00:50:20.350 --> 00:50:23.220
SORT OF CALLING UP STAFF AND

00:50:23.286 --> 00:50:24.488
HAVING THEM. IT'S DIFFERENT

00:50:24.554 --> 00:50:25.989
ACTIONS THAT MAY NOT REFLECT

00:50:26.056 --> 00:50:28.091
THE CONSENSUS REPORT SO AS A

00:50:28.158 --> 00:50:29.693
RESULT THAT REALLY NEEDS IS

00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:30.761
VERY IMPORTANT IN OUR BOARD

00:50:30.827 --> 00:50:32.429
MEETING AND THAT THERE IS AN

00:50:32.496 --> 00:50:35.298
OPPORTUNITY. TO GAIN AT A

00:50:35.365 --> 00:50:36.933
COLLECTIVE UNDERSTANDING OF

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:39.035
WHAT THE BOARD DIRECTION IS AND

00:50:39.102 --> 00:50:40.837
WHAT THE NEXT STEPS ARE THAT WE

00:50:40.904 --> 00:50:43.673
EXPECT. FOR STAFF- AND SO IT'S

00:50:43.740 --> 00:50:45.709
MICHAEL IN RUNNING THE MEETING

00:50:45.776 --> 00:50:46.877
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO HAVE

00:50:46.943 --> 00:50:50.080
THAT- ROBUST INTERACTION- AND

00:50:50.147 --> 00:50:51.815
THAT WE'RE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT

00:50:51.882 --> 00:50:54.818
YOU'RE ACTION THAT WE WANT TO

00:50:54.885 --> 00:50:56.052
PROVIDE TO STAFF. OR THANK YOU

FOR THAT- YOU KNOW PART OF THE

00:50:58.288 --> 00:51:00.223
QUESTION WAS ALSO BASED ON.

00:51:00.290 --> 00:51:02.893
PERSONAL EXPERIENCE- OF WORKING

00:51:02.959 --> 00:51:07.631
ON POLICIES AND- ACTUALLY.

00:51:07.697 --> 00:51:09.433
BEING SO FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO

00:51:09.499 --> 00:51:12.235
HAVE- THE PRO TEM BE HELPFUL TO

00:51:12.302 --> 00:51:14.137
SOME OF THAT BUT NEEDING THAT

00:51:14.204 --> 00:51:16.840
EXTRA PUSH BECAUSE OF- THE

00:51:16.907 --> 00:51:20.310
BUREAUCRACY- AT THE A. R. B.

00:51:20.377 --> 00:51:22.546
AND- GETTING THE DISTINCT

00:51:22.612 --> 00:51:23.847
FEELING THAT IT WAS NOT REALLY

00:51:23.914 --> 00:51:27.784
DRIVEN BY- BOARD POLICIES- BUT

00:51:27.851 --> 00:51:30.020
BY OTHER ENTIIES AND SO I JUST

00:51:30.086 --> 00:51:31.254
WANTED TO SORT OF. YOU KNOW

IN THIS NEW LEADERSHIP AND IN

00:51:36.059 --> 00:51:39.296
YOUR VISION. NOT VERY MUCH SO.

00:51:39.362 --> 00:51:41.998
OKAY SO I FEEL LIKE I'M GONNA

00:51:42.065 --> 00:51:42.766
YOU KNOW ASK THE BLACK PEOPLE

00:51:42.833 --> 00:51:45.669
QUESTION- BECAUSE THERE WAS A

00:51:45.735 --> 00:51:48.271

WIDELY WRITTEN BY- BLACKSTAFF I

QUESTIONI ALSO SAID THAT I

00:51:55.212 --> 00:51:56.213
HOPE THAT THERE WAS NO

00:51:56.279 --> 00:51:57.814
RETALIATION HAPPENING AGAINST

00:51:57.881 --> 00:51:59.015

00:56:07.263 --> 00:56:09.699
CONSTITUTED- OVER THE LAST FEW

00:56:09.766 --> 00:56:11.434
MONTHS AND IT'S A TEAM OF

00:56:11.501 --> 00:56:13.870
INCREDIBLY EXPERIENCED. AND

00:56:13.937 --> 00:56:16.539
TALENTED PEOPLE WHO- WHO LOOK

00:56:16.606 --> 00:56:23.046
LIKE CALIFORNIA- AND THAT IS.

00:56:23.113 --> 00:56:23.613
THAT LEADERSHIP IS VERY MUCH

00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:26.649
APPRECIATED- WHICH FOR. TO THE

00:56:26.716 --> 00:56:28.518
EXTERNAL ISSUES I THINK YOU'RE

00:56:28.585 --> 00:56:32.522
RIGHT YES- IF AN AGENCY IS NOT.

00:56:32.589 --> 00:56:35.458
UNDERSTANDING THE LIVES AND THE

00:56:35.525 --> 00:56:36.926
LIVED EXPERIENCE OF UNDER

00:56:36.993 --> 00:56:38.595
REPRESENTED PEOPLE THEN IT IS

00:56:38.661 --> 00:56:41.598
NOT VERY DIFFICULT PICTURE.

00:56:41.664 --> 00:56:46.770
PEOPLE AND SO AND THE- THINK

00:56:46.836 --> 00:56:49.205
ABOUT- WORKING WITH

00:56:49.272 --> 00:56:52.175
COMMUNITIES. I THINK THE WAY I

00:56:52.242 --> 00:56:54.110
EIGHT- VIEW IT IS THE FIRST

00:56:54.177 --> 00:56:55.512
STEP IS TO LISTEN TO

00:56:55.578 --> 00:56:56.913
COMMUNITIES AND UNDERSTAND WHAT

00:56:56.980 --> 00:56:58.848
THEIR ISSUES ARE AND WHAT THE

00:56:58.915 --> 00:57:03.219
CHALLENGES ARE AND IN THEIR-

00:57:03.286 --> 00:57:06.122
AT. THAT LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND

00:57:06.189 --> 00:57:07.991
NOT TO ASSUME THAT WE KNOW SORT

00:57:08.057 --> 00:57:09.392
OF WHAT THE SOLUTIONIS AND

00:57:09.459 --> 00:57:10.760
WHAT THE AND WITH THE RIGHT

00:57:10.827 --> 00:57:13.163
STRATEGY IS- BUT TO REALLY MAKE

00:57:13.229 --> 00:57:14.831
IT A MORE OF A COLLABORATIVE

00:57:14.898 --> 00:57:18.768
DISCUSSION- I WAS TALKING TO-

00:57:18.835 --> 00:57:22.005
AND ACTIVISTS THE OTHER DAY.

00:57:22.071 --> 00:57:25.008
THAT THAT- THAT FRONTLINE

00:57:25.074 --> 00:57:26.276
COMMUNITIES ARE THE ONES WHO

00:57:26.342 --> 00:57:27.443
LIVE WITH THE UNINTENDED

00:57:27.510 --> 00:57:30.513
CONSEQUENCES. AND SO IN

00:57:30.580 --> 00:57:32.749
DEVELOPING OUR REGULATORY WORK

00:57:32.816 --> 00:57:35.285
AND OUR PROGRAMMING IT'S REALLY

00:57:35.351 --> 00:57:38.721
IMPORTANT TO- UNDERSTAND WHAT

00:57:38.788 --> 00:57:39.989
THOSE POTENTIAL UNINTENDED

00:57:40.056 --> 00:57:42.559
CONSEQUENCES ARCH- AND THE ONLY

00:57:42.625 --> 00:57:43.493
WAY YOU CAN DO THAT IS BY

00:57:43.560 --> 00:57:45.628
REALLY HAVING CONVERSATIONS

00:57:45.695 --> 00:57:46.462
WITH THE COMMUNITY AND

00:57:46.529 --> 00:57:47.230
UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE

00:57:47.297 --> 00:57:49.632
COMMUNITY WANTS AND HOW THOSE-

00:57:49.699 --> 00:57:53.002
THAT. PROGRAMS ARE AFFECTING

00:57:53.069 --> 00:57:55.305
THOSE COMMUNITIES- AND SO I'M

00:57:55.371 --> 00:57:57.740
REALLY- I HAVE BEEN IMPRESSED

00:57:57.807 --> 00:58:01.244
WITH THE TEAM WE HAVE HERE- AT

00:58:01.311 --> 00:58:03.213

00:58:11.688 --> 00:58:14.891
THAT OUR CONTINUED WORK- WITH

00:58:14.958 --> 00:58:19.495
REGARD TO- SCOPING PLAN AND-

00:58:19.562 --> 00:58:20.964
EIGHTY SIX POINT SEVEN AND ALL

00:58:21.030 --> 00:58:22.332
OF THE DIFFERENT WAYS THAT WE

00:58:22.398 --> 00:58:23.666
ARE. IN COMMUNITIES AND

00:58:23.733 --> 00:58:25.501
INTERACTING- AND BUILDING

00:58:25.568 --> 00:58:27.704
RELATIONSHIPS BECAUSE THOSE

00:58:27.770 --> 00:58:33.276
RELATIONSHIPS ON TOPICS AROUND-

00:58:33.343 --> 00:58:36.946
A LOCAL AND- RECEIVING A- IT

00:58:37.013 --> 00:58:37.714
MIGHT MIGHT ALSO YOU KNOW YOU

00:58:37.780 --> 00:58:40.183
WANT YOU YOU YOU WANT MAY WANT

00:58:40.250 --> 00:58:41.484

COMMUNITY OR OTHER ISSUES THEIR

00:58:45.355 --> 00:58:48.057
THING IN THE COMMUNITY- AND SO

00:58:48.124 --> 00:58:50.193
AVOIDING THE SILOS OF ALL OF

00:58:50.260 --> 00:58:51.561
OUR DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS AND

00:58:51.628 --> 00:58:54.964
REALLY TRYING TO ENGAGE. WITH

00:58:55.031 --> 00:58:56.966
COMMUNITIES ABOUT THE TOPICS

00:58:57.033 --> 00:58:57.800
THAT THAT THEY WANT TO TALK

00:58:57.867 --> 00:59:02.605
ABOUT- IS THAT- I THINK THE

00:59:02.672 --> 00:59:03.873
BEST WAY WE CAN MOVE FORWARD

00:59:03.940 --> 00:59:06.609
AND IMPROVE THE WAY WE WORK

00:59:06.676 --> 00:59:07.543
WITH COMMUNITIES. WELL YOU KNOW

00:59:07.610 --> 00:59:09.812
I COULDN'T AGREE WITH YOU MORE

00:59:09.879 --> 00:59:11.848
ON THAT I DO WANT TO SAY AS YOU

00:59:11.915 --> 00:59:13.850
WERE. TALKING I LOOKED I

00:59:13.917 --> 00:59:16.653
SCROLLED ON DOWN THE WEBSITE

00:59:16.719 --> 00:59:21.658
AND- DEFINITELY HAVE. A- A

00:59:21.724 --> 00:59:23.493
GROUP OF LEADERS ON YOUR

00:59:23.559 --> 00:59:24.560
EXECUTIVE TEAM THAT ARE

00:59:24.627 --> 00:59:26.829
REFLECTIVE OF CALIFORNIA BUT I

00:59:26.896 --> 00:59:29.399
JUST CAUTION THAT WOULD YOU

00:59:29.465 --> 00:59:31.534
KNOW AS I TRY TO TELL MYSELF

00:59:31.601 --> 00:59:32.368
THAT WE THINK OUTSIDE OF THE

00:59:32.435 --> 00:59:34.337
BOX BECAUSE YOU YOU KNOW YOU

00:59:34.404 --> 00:59:36.306
HAVE A SISTER WHO'S HANDLING E.

00:59:36.372 --> 00:59:37.307
J. SO THAT'S ALWAYS LIKE

00:59:37.373 --> 00:59:38.508
PUTTING A BLACK PERSON IN

00:59:38.574 --> 00:59:40.877
CHARGE OF DIVERSITY- AND THEN

00:59:40.944 --> 00:59:42.145
YOU HAVE A SISTER IN TURN. IN

00:59:42.211 --> 00:59:43.713
TERMS AT RUNNING INTERNAL

00:59:43.780 --> 00:59:45.348
OPERATIONS AND THAT SORT OF

00:59:45.415 --> 00:59:46.883
MAKES ME THINK OF THE GS AND WE

00:59:46.950 --> 00:59:48.217
HAVE CERTAINLY A WHOLE BUNCH OF

00:59:48.284 --> 00:59:49.886
FOLKS OF COLOR. MAKING SURE

00:59:49.953 --> 00:59:52.021
THAT OUR OFFICES ARE CLEAN- BUT

00:59:52.088 --> 00:59:54.090
WE DO PEOPLE OF COLOR DO FAR

00:59:54.157 --> 00:59:57.593
MORE THAN THAT- AND SO. IF WE

00:59:57.660 --> 01:00:02.665
CAN EXPAND OUR- OPTIONS TO BE

01:00:02.732 --> 01:00:04.634
MORE INCLUSIVE IN WAYS THAT MAY

01:00:04.701 --> 01:00:06.836
MAKE SOME OF US UNCOMFORTABLE-

01:00:06.903 --> 01:00:08.204
I THINK THAT'S WHEN WE HAVE

01:00:08.271 --> 01:00:10.306
MUCH MORE RICH DISCUSSIONS-

01:00:10.373 --> 01:00:12.141
WHICH LEADS INTO WHAT YOU WERE

01:00:12.208 --> 01:00:13.276
TALKING ABOUT ABOUT

01:00:13.343 --> 01:00:14.477
COMMUNITIES. AND THEREFORE

01:00:14.544 --> 01:00:17.080
LISTENING WE SEE HOW ROBUST AND

01:00:17.146 --> 01:00:22.151
VIBRANT- AND NON MONOLITHIC-

01:00:22.218 --> 01:00:22.785
COMMUNITIES ARE AND THEIR NEEDS

01:00:22.852 --> 01:00:26.422
ARE- YOU KNOW I TRUST. THAT

01:00:26.489 --> 01:00:27.924
UNDER YOUR LEADERSHIP THE BOARD

01:00:27.991 --> 01:00:29.792
WILL BE DRIVING THE POLICIES.

01:00:29.859 --> 01:00:31.027
THAT ARE FOCUSED ON

01:00:31.094 --> 01:00:33.696
CALIFORNIANS- AND THAT WILL

01:00:33.763 --> 01:00:35.198
REALLY PRIORITIZE THOSE

01:00:35.264 --> 01:00:36.532
COMMUNITIES THAT ARE SUFFERING

01:00:36.599 --> 01:00:39.602
FROM- POLLUTION HERE. AND I

01:00:39.669 --> 01:00:42.138
JUST. YOU KNOW AS YOU WERE

01:00:42.205 --> 01:00:43.873
TALKING ABOUT AVOIDING SILOS.

01:00:43.940 --> 01:00:46.442
WHEN I THINK I. WAS REFLECTING

01:00:46.509 --> 01:00:48.044
ON AN ARIAL TOUR THAT I TOOK

01:00:48.111 --> 01:00:48.911

01:00:48.978 --> 01:00:51.214
SOUTHERN PART OF THE DISTRICT I

01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:53.416
SAW NO TREES. BUT I SAW SO

01:00:53.483 --> 01:00:56.285

01:59:30.263 --> 01:59:33.799
SOURCE POLLUTION AND SO FOR ME

01:59:33.866 --> 01:59:35.601
GETTING TO THAT PLACE OF NOT

01:59:53.786 --> 01:59:56.589
UNDERSTAND THAT IN TERMS OF OUR

01:59:56.656 --> 01:59:59.992
ECONOMY- EIGHT THE OIL AND GAS

02:00:00.059 --> 02:00:02.261
PRODUCTION IS VERY IMPORTANT

02:00:02.328 --> 02:00:05.665

THAT BUSINESS OWNERS THAT ARE

02:00:15.174 --> 02:00:16.976
HEAVILY IMPACTED BY THE

02:00:17.043 --> 02:00:18.277
DECISIONS MAKE THE

02:00:18.344 --> 02:00:20.580
TRANSITION TO ZERO EMISSIONS-

02:00:20.646 --> 02:00:21.981
WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO IS

SPEED RAIL ADVOCATE MANY MANY

02:05:09.735 --> 02:05:11.270
YEARS AGO. WHEN I FIRST

STARTED- AND THERE'S BEEN MUCH

02:05:13.839 --> 02:05:16.642
CHANGE. SINCE THEN AS AS IT

02:05:16.709 --> 02:05:20.246
RELATES TO- HOW THAT'S EVOLVED

02:05:20.312 --> 02:05:22.781
IN EVEN IN MY OWN COMMUNITY.

02:05:22.848 --> 02:05:24.683
WHERE THE LOCATION IS OF HIGH

02:05:24.750 --> 02:05:26.051
SPEED RAIL AND HOW THAT

02:05:26.118 --> 02:05:28.153
INTERACTION EFFECTS. AS IT

02:05:28.220 --> 02:05:30.723
RELATES- JUNTS TO THE

02:05:30.789 --> 02:05:34.093
COMMUNITIES. SO WHAT I AM AND

02:05:34.159 --> 02:05:36.462
WHAT I CAN SAY IS THAT- I

02:05:36.528 --> 02:05:39.298
RESPECT- MASS TRANSPORTATION

02:05:39.365 --> 02:05:41.867
AND ITS IMPORTANCE. AS SOMEONE

02:05:41.934 --> 02:05:44.470
HAD SPIES SAID EARLIER. TODAY

02:05:44.536 --> 02:05:46.105
BUT TRANSPORTATION IS ONE OF

02:05:46.171 --> 02:05:48.340
OUR LARGEST- EMISSION

02:05:48.407 --> 02:05:50.109
REDUCTIONS BASIS WE NEED TO OUR

02:05:50.175 --> 02:05:52.244
FAX. AND YOU KNOW THERE IS A

02:05:52.311 --> 02:05:54.380
SLIGHT TENSION WITH. VEHICLE

02:05:54.446 --> 02:05:56.448
MILES TRAVELED AS WELL AS

02:05:56.515 --> 02:05:57.816
GETTING PEOPLE ON PUBLIC

02:05:57.883 --> 02:06:01.654
TRANSIT. AND SO- I AM LOOKING

02:06:01.720 --> 02:06:04.023
FOR THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY AND

02:06:04.089 --> 02:06:05.491
TRYING TO FIND AND FIGURE OUT

02:06:05.557 --> 02:06:08.060
WAYS THAT WE CAN REDUCE PEOPLE

02:06:08.127 --> 02:06:10.429
DRIVING- BY THEMSELVES AS MUCH

02:06:10.496 --> 02:06:13.432
AS POSSIBLE. AND TRYING TO USE.

02:06:13.499 --> 02:06:15.467
NOT ONLY HIGH SPEED RAIL- BUT

02:06:15.534 --> 02:06:18.537
ALSO IN OUR- AREA CALTRAIN-

02:06:18.604 --> 02:06:20.773
THEY WERE GOING TO ELECTRIFY-

02:06:20.839 --> 02:06:22.474
AND SO IT'S INVESTMENTS I

02:06:22.541 --> 02:06:25.411
SEATED FOR THE FUTURE AND-

02:06:25.477 --> 02:06:29.882
THEY'RE NOT. EASY- IT'S NOT AS

02:06:29.949 --> 02:06:31.817
SOME. OUT SAY THAT MY BUT I BUT

02:06:31.884 --> 02:06:33.652
I WILL SAY HIGH SPEED RAIL IS

02:06:33.719 --> 02:06:36.422
ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE- MOBILE

02:06:36.488 --> 02:06:38.791
SOURCES THAT GETTING TO-

02:06:38.857 --> 02:06:42.661
MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE- IN LARGER.

02:06:42.728 --> 02:06:44.997
GROUPS SO THAT WE CAN REDUCE

02:06:45.064 --> 02:06:47.199
EMISSIONS AND I'M FOLLOWING IT

02:06:47.266 --> 02:06:50.069
CLOSELY- AND I HAVE MY EYES TO

02:06:50.135 --> 02:06:52.604
FIGURING OUT- JUST EXACTLY HOW

02:06:52.671 --> 02:06:55.841
IMPORTANT IT IS. FOR CALIFORNIA

02:06:55.908 --> 02:06:58.243
AND IT IT WILL BE IMPORTANT FOR

02:06:58.310 --> 02:07:00.679
ME TO WATCH HOW IT ALSO IMPACTS

02:07:00.746 --> 02:07:02.881
THE COMMUNITIES FOR WHAT SHE

02:07:02.948 --> 02:07:05.551
GOES THROUGH. SO IT I

APPRECIATE THAT BUT AGAIN WHEN

02:07:07.152 --> 02:07:07.820

DISTRICT. AND THERE'S NO RAIL

02:07:25.004 --> 02:07:25.838

WHEN I WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY THE

02:08:28.667 --> 02:08:29.401
PERSON WHO REPRESENT THAT

02:08:29.468 --> 02:08:33.338
DISTRICT I WAS IN A FIGHT WITH

02:08:33.405 --> 02:08:34.006

TRUCK THAT WE TAKE TO THE RANCH.

02:09:08.941 --> 02:09:10.075
IN AND THE COMMENT THAT SHE

02:09:10.142 --> 02:09:11.443
REPLIED BACK TO ME IS LIKE YOUR

02:09:11.510 --> 02:09:13.145
FAMILY IS THE TOTAL BECAUSE OF

GLOBAL WARMING. AND I JUST

02:09:15.114 --> 02:09:16.315
THOUGHT WELL YOU HAVE NO IDEA I

02:09:16.381 --> 02:09:17.816
THE KID THAT TRIES TO FROM

02:09:17.883 --> 02:09:19.351
BAKERSFIELD FRESNO STATE TO GO

TO SCHOOL AND GET AN EDUCATION.

02:09:21.220 --> 02:09:22.421
I HAVE A DAUGHTER THAT TRIES TO

02:09:22.488 --> 02:09:24.890

DAUGHTER THAT DRIVES TO- TAFT

02:09:31.997 --> 02:09:33.832
TO GET HER OLDER STANDARDS

02:09:33.899 --> 02:09:35.501
CALLED IMAGING ENGINEER NOW.

02:09:35.567 --> 02:09:39.972
AND CERTIFICATE OR WHATEVER SO

02:09:40.038 --> 02:09:40.539
THAT SHE CAN DO ALTER SOUNDS

AND MY HUSBAND GOES TO WORK AND

02:09:42.574 --> 02:09:44.576
I GO TO WORK AND THERE'S NO WAY

02:09:44.643 --> 02:09:45.444
WE COULD SHARE. A COUPLE OF

02:09:45.511 --> 02:09:47.346
VEHICLES. AND SO I JUST THINK

02:09:47.412 --> 02:09:48.814
THAT THE LIVED EXPERIENCES THAT

02:09:48.881 --> 02:09:50.315
WE ALL HAVE HAVE IN WILL MAKE

02:09:50.382 --> 02:09:51.350
DECISIONS IN THIS BUILDING

02:09:51.416 --> 02:09:53.218
BASED ON OUR LIFE EXPERIENCE I

02:09:53.285 --> 02:09:55.154
GET THAT. I GET THAT NO ONE

02:09:55.220 --> 02:09:57.089
KNOWS HOW WE LIVE- UNTIL THEY

02:09:57.156 --> 02:09:58.423
EXPERIENCE IT AND YOU KNOW I

02:09:58.490 --> 02:09:59.992
DON'T KNOW HOW MY COLLEAGUE IN.

02:10:00.058 --> 02:10:00.726
YOU KNOW LOS ANGELES HERE THIS

02:10:00.792 --> 02:10:02.327
IT'S NEXT TO ME. WHAT HER

02:10:02.394 --> 02:10:03.695
LIFESTYLE IS BUT I KNOW IT'S

02:10:03.762 --> 02:10:05.164
DIFFERENT THAN MINE. BUT I

02:10:05.230 --> 02:10:06.698
THINK THAT WE NEED TO TAKE INTO

02:10:06.765 --> 02:10:08.000
CONSIDERATION ALL OF OUR

02:10:08.066 --> 02:10:09.835
CONSTITUENTS IN THOSE LIFE

02:10:09.902 --> 02:10:11.703
EXPERIENCES WHERE THEY ARE. AND

02:10:11.770 --> 02:10:13.539
I WOULD JUST LIKE SOME. A

02:10:13.605 --> 02:10:15.040
LITTLE CONSIDERATION I GUESS

02:10:15.107 --> 02:10:17.342
FOR THE VALLEY. IN EVERYTHING

02:10:17.409 --> 02:10:17.910
THAT WE HAVE TO OFFER THIS

02:10:17.976 --> 02:10:21.146
STATE- AGAIN I KNOW THAT YOU

02:10:21.213 --> 02:10:22.781
GUYS ARE SO ARE- YOU HAVE A

02:10:22.848 --> 02:10:23.949
SEVERE IMPACT ON THE

02:10:24.016 --> 02:10:25.651
AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY. WHERE

02:10:25.717 --> 02:10:27.219
THE SECOND TOP PRODUCING FRESNO

02:10:27.286 --> 02:10:29.421
IS THE FIRST. CURRENTS A SECOND

02:10:29.488 --> 02:10:30.889
A TWITTER IS A THIRD FOOD

02:10:30.956 --> 02:10:32.791
PRODUCING COUNTY IN THE WORLD.

02:10:32.858 --> 02:10:34.293
I BELIEVE WE PRODUCE OVER A

02:10:34.359 --> 02:10:35.127
HUNDRED AND NINETY NINE

02:10:35.194 --> 02:10:37.429
COMMODITIES WHERE WE PRODUCE

02:10:37.496 --> 02:10:39.865
99% OF THAT FOOD SUPPLY. FOR

02:10:39.932 --> 02:10:42.534
THE WORLD. AND YOU KNOW PUTTING

02:10:42.601 --> 02:10:43.669
THE CENTRAL VALLEY AT A

02:10:43.735 --> 02:10:44.870
BUSINESS FROM GROWING FOOD NOT

02:10:44.937 --> 02:10:45.871
ONLY AFFECTS THE FOOD SUPPLY

02:10:45.938 --> 02:10:47.539
HERE IN CALIFORNIA. BUT THE

02:10:47.606 --> 02:10:49.308
FOOD SUPPLY FOR THE WORLD AND

02:10:49.374 --> 02:10:50.976
THAT IS NOT AN UNDERSTATEMENT.

02:10:51.043 --> 02:10:52.211
THE GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF

02:10:52.277 --> 02:10:54.213
CALIFORNIA IS BLESSED. TO

02:10:54.279 --> 02:10:56.114
GOVERNOR STATE WITH THE TOP SIX

02:10:56.181 --> 02:10:58.617
PRODUCING. FOOD COUNTIES IN THE

02:10:58.684 --> 02:11:00.519
ENTIRE WORLD SALINAS VALLEY

02:11:00.586 --> 02:11:04.089
WHERE THEY GROW THE LETTUCE AND

02:11:04.156 --> 02:11:04.656
THINGS LIKE THAT SO IT'S NOT

02:11:04.723 --> 02:11:05.257
JUST A CENTRAL VALLEY. AND I

02:11:05.324 --> 02:11:05.824
JUST THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE

02:11:05.891 --> 02:11:07.259
SOME TYPE OF CONSIDERATION FOR

02:11:07.326 --> 02:11:09.027
THESE COMMUNITIES. THAT ARE

02:11:09.094 --> 02:11:11.096
TRYING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO

02:11:11.163 --> 02:11:11.763
AND WE ARE POLITICALLY

02:11:11.830 --> 02:11:14.666
DIFFERENT. M. BUT WE ARE TRYING

02:11:14.733 --> 02:11:15.767
EVERYTHING WE CAN TO HELP MEET

02:11:15.834 --> 02:11:17.903
THE CLIMATE GOALS THAT ARE SET

02:11:17.970 --> 02:11:21.340
FORTH. LIKE I SAID EARLIER 51%

02:11:21.406 --> 02:11:23.475
OF THE SOLAR. THAT FUELS

02:11:23.542 --> 02:11:25.210
CALIFORNIA COMES FROM KERN

02:11:25.277 --> 02:11:28.080
COUNTY. AND THOSE MEGA SOLAR

02:11:28.146 --> 02:11:30.449
WHAT PLANTS ARE IN KERN COUNTY

02:11:30.515 --> 02:11:32.751
AND WE GET NO BENEFIT. THE

02:11:32.818 --> 02:11:34.686
ENERGY GOES NORTH AND GO SOUTH

02:11:34.753 --> 02:11:36.421
AND WE DON'T GET TAX REVENUE.

02:11:36.488 --> 02:11:39.324
M. AND IT'S VERY FRUSTRATING.

02:11:39.391 --> 02:11:41.126
SO I JUST AM LOOKING FOR

02:11:41.193 --> 02:11:43.195
SOMEBODY HE WILL JUST TAKE AN

02:11:43.262 --> 02:11:45.530
HONEST LOOK LIKE. LIKE MISS

02:11:45.597 --> 02:11:47.499
WATER I'D PICK A WINNER I DON'T

02:11:47.566 --> 02:11:48.700
I DON'T THINK SHE'LL AGREE WITH

02:11:48.767 --> 02:11:50.702
US 1100% OF THE TIME SHE MAY

02:11:50.769 --> 02:11:52.004
NOT EVEN AGREE WITH US 50% OF

02:11:52.070 --> 02:11:54.906
THE TIME. BUT SHE'S WILLING. TO

02:11:54.973 --> 02:11:58.210
LOOK AT THIS SIDE JUST LIKE I'M

02:11:58.277 --> 02:11:59.411
SURE SHE'S WILLING TO LOOK AT

02:11:59.478 --> 02:12:01.446
LOS ANGELES ASIDE. AND THAT'S

02:12:01.513 --> 02:12:02.848
ALL I'M ASKING FOR IS SOMEBODY

02:12:02.914 --> 02:12:04.650
WHO'S GONNA LOOK AT THINGS.

02:12:04.716 --> 02:12:06.652
FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE SPECTRUM

02:12:06.718 --> 02:12:08.186
AND NOT BE AN ACTIVIST ON THE

02:12:08.253 --> 02:12:09.454

LOOKING THAT'S THE BOARD MEMBER

02:12:11.890 --> 02:12:14.826

TRANSPORTATION. BUT I ALSO WANT

02:12:21.266 --> 02:12:22.200
YOU TO APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT

02:12:22.267 --> 02:12:23.935
IT ALWAYS DOESN'T WORK IN EVERY

02:12:24.002 --> 02:12:26.004
AREA OF THE STATE. AND I'M I'M

02:12:26.071 --> 02:12:30.108

CENTRAL VALLEY IS MUCH

02:12:43.322 --> 02:12:45.390

AARON AND I FEEL THAT. SO

02:22:20.632 --> 02:22:23.801

LEADERSHIP THAT CHAIR RANDOLPH

BRINGS- I THINK IS GOING TO BE

02:22:36.714 --> 02:22:41.019
MORE- CAN BY CONSENSUS- I VERY

02:22:41.085 --> 02:22:43.988
MUCH. I ENJOYED WORKING WITH

THE PREVIOUS CHAIR MARY NICHOLS

02:22:45.823 --> 02:22:47.158
WHO I GREATLY RESPECT AND I

02:22:47.225 --> 02:22:48.192
THINK SHE DID INCREDIBLE

02:22:48.259 --> 02:22:49.627
SERVICE FOR THE STATE OF

02:22:49.694 --> 02:22:51.362
CALIFORNIA THE NATION IN THE

02:22:51.429 --> 02:22:56.367
WORLD. BUT BECAUSE SHE WAS SUCH

02:22:56.434 --> 02:22:59.103
A WELL ESTABLISHED LEADER IN

02:22:59.170 --> 02:23:03.675
THE FIELD- IT DID TEND TO ARE

02:23:03.741 --> 02:23:08.046
WE DO TEND TO FALL IN LINE-

02:23:08.112 --> 02:23:10.214
MAYBE MORE OFTEN THAN NOT- IN

02:23:10.281 --> 02:23:11.649
TERMS OF HER LEADERSHIP WHICH

02:23:11.716 --> 02:23:15.019
