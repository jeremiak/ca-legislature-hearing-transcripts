NOT NO OKAY SO WE'LL BEGIN WITH OUR FIRST PANEL- PRESENTATION OF THE ATTORNEY JOBS EFFORTS TO COMBAT HUMAN TRAFFICKING- JOHN MARSH CHIEF OF DIVISION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. I DON'T SEE HIM IN A ROOM SO YOU MUST BE BY THE VARIOUS CM NOW. YOU WHENEVER YOU'RE READY MISTER MARSH YOU MAY BEGIN. AND YOU HAVE MINUTES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- IT'S GREAT SEEING YOU IN THANKS TO THE MEMBERS FOR INVITING US TO TALK ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE. I'D LIKE TO START OFF JUST GIVING SOME BACKGROUND- ABOUT TRAFFICKING IN CALIFORNIA SO CALIFORNIA HAS THE HIGHEST HUMAN TRAFFICKING RATE WITHIN THE UNITED STATES ARGUMENT DRAFTING TEAMS HAVE FOUND. DOCTORS USE MANY DIFFERENT TACTICS TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN THEIR VICTIMS INCLUDING FORCIBLE PARTICIPATION AND PSYCHOLOGICAL MANIPULATION. ORGANIZED CRIMINAL ENTERPRISES UTILIZE SEX WORKERS VICTIMS AND TYPICALLY PUT THEM ON A TEN DAY CIRCUIT WE FOUND THAT- THROUGH CALIFORNIA- VICTIMS ARE PUT INTO A BRAWL HOLES OR. STRONG PARLORS AN ATTENDEE CIRCUIT DON'T START IN SACRAMENTO MOVED THROUGH COMMERCIAL- BUILDINGS TO RESIDENTIAL AREAS- THROUGHOUT THE AREA AND THE MOVE TO DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE AND THEN PUT THROUGH ANOTHER TEN DAY CIRCUIT I MOVED TO DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE MAKING- IDENTIFICATION DIFFICULT FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT- WE'VE SEEN THAT- MASSAGE PARLORS AND BROTHELS. ABOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN BOTH LARGE CITIES- COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS RESIDENTIAL LOCATIONS- TRAFFICKERS OF JUVENILES IN THE SAN DIEGO AREA HAS GONE UP 33% OVER THE LAST YEAR. RECEIVE CORRELATIONS POSSIBLY- TO COPE WITH- BUT PEOPLE ARE HOME MORE IN- UTILIZING- VICTIMIZING YOUNG PEOPLE. SO LET ME EXPLAIN WHAT DOJ'S CURRENTLY DOING AND- OUR ROLE WITHIN WITHIN THE SPACE OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING IN SOME AREAS THAT WERE FOCUSING ON. SO THE DIVISION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS TO IDENTIFY HUMAN TRAFFICKING TEAMS WHICH WE REFUNDED FOR- WE ALSO HAVE A TASK FORCE IN THE SAN DIEGO AREA. OUR HUMAN TRAFFICKING JAMES TAKE A THREEFOLD APPROACH. TO SEX TRAFFICKING FOCUSING ON SEX TRAFFICKING MASSAGE PARLORS MARSHALL AND RESIDENTIAL BROTHELS. LABOR TRAFFICKING. IN HOME CARE FACILITIES CANNABIS CULTIVATION AND RESTAURANTS AND THIRDLY EXPEDITORS FOCUSING ON TWO NINETY MONITORING IN. TWO EIGHT- TO EIGHTY EIGHT UNDER COVER OPERATIONS. ANOTHER HUMAN TRAFFIC- RESPONSE SCHEME AS IDENTIFIED IN FOCUSING ON RECOVERING THE VICTIMS FROM HUMAN TRAFFICKING- WE UTILIZE A FOUR P. MODEL. FOCUSING ON PREVENTION- BEFORE TO CURSE PROTECTION USING A TRAUMA INFORMED APPROACH. PROSECUTION ENCOURAGING PROSECUTION PROSECUTORS TO CHARGE HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND HELPING WITH THE COMPLEXITY OF THOSE CASES. IN PARTNERSHIP WE ENCOURAGE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS TO PARTICIPATE WITH OUR TEAMS. BUT WE ALSO FOCUS ON EXPOSING THESE TYPES OF CRIMINAL ACTIVITY AND TRYING TO BRING IT INTO PLAIN SIGHT. WE FOCUS ON- WORKING WITH VICTIM SERVICES- WE FOCUS ON GETTING THE STEPS LEADS. I'M NOT A LOT OF SURVEILLANCE OPERATIONS ENFORCEMENT AND OTHER STATE AGENCIES AND FEDERAL AGENCIES TO TRY TO EXPOSE. THIS. UNDERGROUND- WORK. WE ALSO HAVE A CRIMINAL LAW DIVISION- WITH PROSECUTORS ASSIGNED FROM OUR SPECIAL PROSECUTIONS SECTION OF THAT SUPPORT DELES HUMAN TRAFFICKING JAMES BUT ALSO SUPPORT LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT DURING HUMAN TRAFFICKING INVESTIGATIONS. FILE CHARGES AGAINST SEX AND LABOR TRAFFICKERS CRIMINAL ALSO MAINTAINS A STATEWIDE HUMAN TRAFFICKING COORDINATOR PROTEST A PAGE IN PUBLIC OUTREACH SERVES AS A LEGAL EXPERT UP FOR THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF ATTORNEY GENERAL'S IN IS A RESOURCE AND POINT OF CONTACT FOR OUR INVESTIGATORS. INVESTIGATORS THROUGHOUT THE STATE ELEVEN MEMBERS OF THE COMMERCIAL HE SEXUALLY EXPLOITED CHILDREN ACTION TEAM. SO GIVE ME AN IDEA I SPOKE ABOUT- DOJ STOPS FLOORSTANDING THE SAN DIEGO AREA. BOB HE MANAGEMENT AND SUPERVISION OF THE TASK FORCE AND NOT CELLS FORCE WORKS WITH SIXTEEN. THE INDIVIDUAL LAW ENFORCEMENT PARTNERS SO IT IS A LARGE TASK FORCE MEMBERS OF THE SAN DIEGO- BEAR BAY AREA- WE UP WE ALSO HAVE TO HUMAN TRAFFICKING TEAMS ONE LOCATED IN SACRAMENTO AND THE SECOND LOCATED IN FRESNO AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY. OUR STATEWIDE ENFORCEMENT MODEL IS TO DISRUPT AND DISMANTLE HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND CHILD EXPLOITATION. WE DO THIS THROUGH A JURISDICTIONAL HUMAN TRAFFICKING CASES. AND FOCUS ON NOT ONLY ENFORCEMENT OR PROSECUTION- PROSECUTION AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CASES- INVOLVED IN INTELLIGENCE SHARING WITH FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND ARTISTIC GATORS- WE'LL GET SOME OF THESE CRIMES SPECIFICALLY BUT WHAT WE FOUND IS A LOT OF OUR OTHER TEAMS UP FOR X. AND Y. Y. COLOR TEAM FOR SPECIAL OPERATIONS TEAM ARE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY G. ARE RUNNING INTO HUMAN TRAFFICKING IN THEIR INVESTIGATIONS THAT DON'T NECESSARILY SPECIFICALLY START OFF AS A HUMAN TRAFFICKING INVESTIGATION. SO SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT THAT WE'VE SEEN- SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZED POLICE AGENCIES DON'T. STAFFING. TO CONDUCT THESE INVESTIGATIONS. OKAY CAN COME AND HELP BUT A LOT OF TIMES THESE TYPES OF INVESTIGATIONS GO ON WORKED UP BECAUSE THEY ARE VERY LABOR INTENSIVE THEY TAKE SURVEILLANCE THEY TAKE A LONG TERM INVESTIGATIONS THEY TAKE. TECHNOLOGY. I THESE TYPES OF INVESTING. THE DAYS OF BEING ABLE TO KNOW US ST WHERE VICTIMS WERE PUT OUT ON THE STREET AND THE TRAFFICKERS WERE STANDING ACROSS THE STREET ARE OVER PAGE NOT IN PLAIN VIEW ANYMORE IT'S DIFFICULT. THE USE OF TECHNOLOGY. AND SOCIAL- INTERNET PLATFORMS AND SOCIAL MEDIA. IS WHERE UP THIS EXISTS AND THANK GEHRY INTO- SERVICES DIFFICULT FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TAKES. THE EXPERTISE AND- THAT TIME TO WORK THESE LONG TERM INVESTIGATIONS. WELL WE NEED MORE EDUCATION FOR LOCAL BUSINESSES WERE CONSTANTLY PUTTING ON TRAINING FOR BUSINESSES TO HELP IDENTIFY VICTIMS AND- PEOPLE THAT ARE INVOLVED IN THIS TYPE OF WORK- WE FOUND LANGUAGE ISSUES- AND PENDING ON THE GEOGRAPHICAL. LOCATION AND- WHERE THE VICTIMS ARE FROM BUT- COUNTRY AND DON'T KNOW HOW TO. AVIGATE AND THERE'S A DISTRUST OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND NOT KNOWING WHERE TO GO- IN THE SITUATIONS. THE FEAR OF INTIMIDATION. TRAFFICKERS OF GETTING IT NOT ONLY BY THE TRAFFICKER BUT PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THE PROSECUTION RATE EMPLOYERS HOLDINGS- WORKERS LOST STAGE THREATENING DEPORTATION THROUGH FEAR OR INTIMIDATION- EMPLOYER STILL. HOLDING WAGES BACK. FOR WORKERS AND GIVING LOWER OR NO WAY NO OVERT NOTE OFF- I THINK YOU CAN DISCARD AS WE FOUND VICTIMS WERE PROBLEM. VERSIONS OF THE PROS. AND ONCE. IT'S FOR- THERE DROP OFF IN IT UNKNOWN OKAY. IN ONLY MINIMAL MONEY OR NO MONEY COMES TO PAY FOR THESE PEOPLE THAT APARTMENTS INTENDED- THIS MARIJUANA GROWS. ANOTHER SOLUTIONS- IT'S EASY TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE PROBLEMS BUT BUT DOJ'S FOCUSED ON- SOLUTIONS ALWAYS HELPS. WE WANT TO FOCUS ON THE FORENSICS- OF THESE CASES WELL WITH THE HELP OF SOME FINANCIAL AUDITORS AND INTELLIGENCE STAFF THIS CAN CAUSE THIS CAN HELP MAKE THIS THING TOGETHER OTHERS THERE'S A LOT OF TASK FORCES. THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WORKING IN THIS AREA BUT THERE'S NOT A LOT OF STATE CONNECTIVITY- AND WE COULD DO BETTER IN THIS SPACE TRAFFICKING. FROM ALL ALL DIFFERENT AREAS BUT WHAT WE FOUND IS. IT'S IN ALL DIFFERENT AREAS WE'VE SEEN IT IN GAMES- WE SEE THE VIOLENCE WE SEE- ORGANIZED CRIMINAL. ENTERPRISES WORKING IN THE SPACE- WE NEED THE OJ YOU WOULD LIKE MORE MONEY FOR CREATING COSTS WHEN WE STARTED OUR TWO TASK FORCES THEY WERE FOCUSED ON. ALLEN STAFFING ENTER OUR INVESTIGATIONS WE FOUND- BUT THERE'S A LOT MORE EXPENSES TO DOING THESE TYPES OF INVESTIGATIONS- WE ALSO. GET MORE HELP ON- VICTIM SERVICES OUR TASK FORCES WERE CREATED WITH WITH PERSONNEL COSTS BUT- NOT COST. SERVICES AND WE'VE SEEN THAT- DOJ COULD DO MORE- ENOUGH SPACE- OPEC DUMPS- AND THEN CREATE INCREASED COLLABORATION WITH NONPROFITS WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME- MAKING CONNECTIONS AND WORKING- WITH NGOS BUT THIS ISN'T ALWAYS AN AREA OF IMPROVEMENT AND I KNOW IT- WHEN YOU HEAR FROM- NGOS LATER THEY'RE GONNA- WHAT THE SAME COLLABORATION SO IT'SSOMETHING THAT- EVERYBODY IS WORKING TOWARDS A BOOK BUT WE WOULD LIKE TO FOCUS MORE- I WOULD LIKE TO. JUST KIND OF GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF. A CASE THAT- HERE J. WAS WORKING ON IT AND IT WASN'T SPECIFICALLY. A HERE AGAIN START AS A HUMAN TRAFFICKING CASE IT WAS OUR SPECIAL OPERATIONS TEAM THAT WAS FOCUSED ON VIOLENT CRIME AND GANGS. M. WHEN THE INVESTIGATION STARTED THE LOCAL AGENCY THAT WE ARE ASSISTING. DO THAT- OTHER HELLO AGAIN PROBLEMS THE GAME WAS VERY VIOLENT. BUT DID NOT KNOW OR- AN ASSUMPTION OF HOW THE GAME WAS- GETTING RESOURCES TO. I MET- I WOULD ACTIONS AND AT PAPER PAPER GUNS AND SUPPLY THEIR GANG MEMBERS AND- DURING THE DURING THE INVESTIGATION WE DETERMINED THAT THE GAME WAS- WORKING. SEX TRAFFICKING THEY WERE SENDING OF THEIR VICTIMS THROUGHOUT THE NATION THIS WAS A SMALL- GANG IN IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND THEY WEREN'T EVEN OFF PUTTING THEIR VICTIMS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY THEY WERE SENDING HIM TO LOS ANGELES TO SAN DIEGO TO NEBRASKA- TO TEXAS ALL OVER THE UNITED STATES AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT HAD NO IDEA THAT THIS ACTIVITY WAS GOING ON BECAUSE IT WASN'T HAPPENING. IN THEIR SPECIFIC AREA- WE WERE ABLE TO TAKE DOWN THE INVESTIGATION TAKE DOWN THIS CRIMINAL ORGANIZATION YEAH AND IT RAN A LOT OF VIOLENT ACTION IN A NOT ONLY AN ACTIVITY. BUT THE- BEGINNING WAS USING SEX TRAFFICKING JUST SUPPORT OTHER ACTIVITIES. IN THE GAMES. SO I POINT THAT OUT- JUST AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THIS ACTIVITY. ISN'T IN PLAIN VIEW ANYMORE IT DOESN'T SPECIFICALLY STAYING IN GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS. SO THE PAIR IN AREAS HAVE YOU CAN IDENTIFY. THESE ISSUES. I BELIEVE THAT CAN BE SENT OVER- ACTION QUESTIONS AND I JUST LIKE TO TAKE SOME TIME TO ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS. FOR YOU- ONE OF THE QUESTIONS WAS WHAT WHAT IS THE OKAY DOING TO COLLABORATE WITH. WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ANOTHER HUMAN TRAFFICKING- TEAMS SO. YES- CONSTANTLY WORKING WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AND OTHER TEAMS TO TRY TO SHARE INFORMATION THROUGHOUT THE STATE A DOJ PARTICIPATES. IN SWEEPS- HELPS LOCAL AGENCIES. IDENTIFY THE PROBLEMS EIGHT THE NEXT LOCAL AGENCIES- WITH CITY WIDE INFORMATION. ANOTHER QUESTION IS- WHAT IS A DOJ DOING- FOR THE VICTIMS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING. ARMANEN JUSTICE IS VERY FOCUSED ON OUR PARTNERSHIPS WITH NGOS- WE STAY CONNECTED TO LOCAL SERVICES THROUGHOUT THE STATE- AND THAT IS ONE OF THE BENEFITS OF HAVING A STATE AGENCY. IN THIS SPACE WE HAVE CONNECTIVITY THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND WE CAN HELP. LOCAL AGENCY. BURKE GOOD ORAL. WILL COMMISSIONS. I'M SORRY- OKAY LOCAL AGENCIES TO SERVICES THROUGHOUT THE STATE- ANOTHER QUESTION WAS- THIS DOJ- CURRENTLY PER RECOMMENDATIONS REGARD THE PREVENTION OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING SINCE THE DISCLOSURE OF THE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE REPORT- TWO THOUSAND TWELVE REPORT- FOCUSED ON PROMOTE GREEN SUPPLY CHAINS STRENGTHENED RESTRICTIONS A STATE CONTRACTORS IN INCREASED PUBLIC AWARENESS- YOUR J. SPECIFICALLY. HAS FOCUSED ON THOSE AREAS- WE'RE STARTING- WITH ARE YOU IN GRAMMAR SCHOOL AREAS TO- CONTINUE TO- PROMOTE AWARENESS. IN THIS AREA AND WORK ON- GETTING BETTER AT- INVESTIGATIONS BASED WITH A COMPLETE COMPUTER FORENSICS AND UTILIZING. A PAST TRAINING OF OUR OUR PERSONNEL. AND THEN THE LAST QUESTION WAS WELL AS BUDGET CONCERNS IN. A NEED FOR ADDITIONAL BUDGETS- SO FIRST INVESTIGATION IN IN IN PERSONNEL TECHNOLOGY AND ADVANCED TRAINING- I WOULD BE SPECIFICALLY FOR DOJ- WE COULD INCREASE IN THOSE AREAS ANOTHER AREA YES I SPOKE ABOUT EARLIER THIS EDUCATION AND OUTREACH TO THE COMMUNITY. WELL WE ARE CONSTANTLY OUT AT BUSINESSES AND HOTELS BUT I'M NOT ONLY BUSINESSES BUT- COUNTY BOARD SUPERVISORS AND CITY COUNCILS AND- TRYING TO EXPLAIN THE ISSUES AND THEN SCHOOLS. IN A RESOURCE SERVICES. I AND ALLOW. YOUR BUDGET ATHLETIC YOU BUDGET I BUT IT AREA THE DOJ VERY POOR ON HIS VICTIMS. WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MORE OF A VICTIM STERN WHICH IN. FOR VICTIMS AND IT'S OUR OUR CAPACITY. TO MORE SERVE THAT- NOT ONLY I WANTED TO POINT OUT BUT SOME QUESTIONS THAT CAME FROM THE BOARD AND OPEN TO ANY QUESTIONS YEAH I WAS REMISS TO INTRODUCE. US TO THE PARISH IS A SPECIAL AGENT IN CHARGE OF OUR HUMAN TRAFFICKING TEAMS HERE PARTMINER JUSTICE SO WE GET INTO ANY READING- KEY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS REGARDING OPERATIONS OR WORK OUR TEAMS- SHE'S HERE AT- INJURY QUESTIONS ALSO. THANK YOU NUMBER NOW JOIN BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER BRIAN ASSEMBLY MEMBERS AND ARE PRICED YEAR ASSEMBLY MEMBER LACKEY- I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS THE COULD BE QUICK BUT I'VE A FEELING THEY WON'T BE QUICK. ON THE ON THE- UNDER DISCUSSION ABOUT BUDGET AND WHAT DO G. NEEDS TO DOJ NEEDS TO JUST TAKE THIS TO THE NEXT LEVEL. SPECIA AND REALLY CARES ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGY. AND THE- WHAT I'M HEARING ABOUT ORGANIZED. CRIMINAL ENTERPRISES. DATA DATA ACTUALLY DUSTER DO BUSINESS MODELS. YOU SELL DRUGS YOU SELL THE DRUG YOU CAN'T USE ANYMORE BUT WITH HUMAN TRAFFICKING IT'S A COMMODITY THAT YOU CAN USE OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN TO MAKE MONEY. AND SO THAT NEW BUSINESS MODEL IS STARTING TO INFILTRATE NOT ONLY GAMES BUT THE CRIMINAL ELEMENT IS USING IT SO ONE- ON THE BUDGET ASPECT- WHAT COMES TO. A GOOD EXAMPLE ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT SMASH AND GRAB- MMHM YOU KNOW I HAD A BILL FOR THAT. MUCH TO MY SURPRISE AND VERY. VERY HAPPY THE GOVERNOR PUT IN TWO HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS INTO THE BUDGET TO COMBAT THAT. COULD BE MADE THAT A PRIORITY AND WE PUT IT IN THERE. SO I WOULD LIKE A BUDGET NUMBER. FOR HOW DO WE COMBAT I'M HUMAN TRAFFICKING YEAR YOU SAY YOU NEED BUDGET BUT I NEED A NUMBER CAN YOU GIVE ME A NUMBER RIGHT NOW TODAY THIS MINUTE. WHAT DO YOU NEED TO GO BACK. IN THE CONTEXT OF. WE APPROVED TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. DEAL WITH SMASH AND GRAB WELL THAT IS VERY DISTURBING. AND IT IS A IT IS A PROBLEM AND IT SCARES THE HECK OUT OF PEOPLE. FROM A HUMAN. STANDPOINT HUMAN TRAFFICKING I THINK RATES MUCH HIGHER THAN THAT. AND THAT WE REALLY NEED TO- TO PUT ALL THE RESOURCES THEY DOT HAS. INTERCEPTED AT THAT'S ONE QUESTION THE SECOND QUESTION IS ABOUT LEGISLATION. ANY ORGANIZED RETAIL THE- WE WENT AFTER AND IS THIS BODY APPROVED WE WENT AFTER INCREASING PENALTIES. ON THE ORGANIZERS NOT THE VICTIMS. NOT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE PARTICIPATING IN ANY ACTIVITY WE TRY TO DO OFF RAMPS AND DO THINGS THAT THEY HELP THEM. BUT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ORGANIZING IT WE EFFECTIVELY MADE IT. HARDER FOR THEM TO GET BACK OUT AGAIN TO CREATE THAT CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN. ARE THE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO. TO GET TO THE- BASICALLY THE RINGLEADERS OF ALL THIS SO THAT- WE CAN GET THEM OFF THE STREET AND IN A WAY FOR THOSE RIGHT. TWO DIFFERENT QUESTIONS. THANK YOU FOR THOSE QUESTIONS- VERY THOUGHTFUL IN IT AND PURCHASE IT- AND IN A HURRY NOT I WANT TO BE EQUALLY ESTOPPEL THE BUDGET ASK- I WOULD I WOULD DEFINITELY LIKE TO AND PROVIDE OPTIONS- IN ORDER. WE DO ALWAYS BEEN TOPPLED A PROVIDING OPTIONS I KNOW IN SOME OTHER ASKS WE BROUGHT BEFORE YOU TO GIVE YOU DIFFERENT LEVELS AND TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF WHAT. RESOURCES WOULD BE USED FOR NOT ONLY USE FOR YOU KNOW I WOULD BRING IN THE REST OF THE STATE AND I THINK THAT'S- A REALLY IMPORTANT IMPORTANT PART OF TACKLING THIS PROBLEM IT IN YOU KNOW CHASE ALWAYS. BEEN A LEADER. IN ORGANIZING AND BRINGING IN COLLABORATING WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT SO I WILL COME BACK TO YOU WITH A THOUGHTFUL BUDGET ASK SOMETHING THAT MAKES SENSE BUT NOT ONLY ONE. SEVERAL OPTIONS. CREATE MORE DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW TO APPROVE WITH APPROPRIATELY ATTACK THIS ISSUE AND I KNOW THERE ARE SOME GREAT SPEAKERS COMING UP AFTER ME- THAT I'D LOVE TO COLLABORATE WITH ALSO IN COMING UP WITH THIS- BUDGET APPS US ABOUT WILL BE SOMETHING THAT THAT ALL FOLLOW UP WITH YOU. I ALSO ONE HUNDRED ORGANIZER'S- THAT IS J. FOCUS. OUR FOCUS IS THE VICTIM'S- AND GETTING THEM THE SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED. BUT OUR SPECIALTY AS FOCUS ON HIGH LEVEL INVESTIGATIONS AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR WE'RE LOOKING AT TAKING DOWN. WE'RE LOOKING AT FINANCIALLY FROM THESE RESOURCES THAT'S WHY I JUST EXPECTED TO BE ABLE TO GIVE ABOUT GAINING IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY BECAUSE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT I HAVE NO IDEA HOW THEY WERE MAKING SO MUCH MONEY THEY WEREN'T EVEN INVOLVED THEIR NARCOTICS. DEALING ANYMORE BECAUSE IT BROUGHT TOO MUCH ATTENTION TO THEM LOCAL AREA AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT WAS PERPLEXED ON HOW MUCH MONEY HE'S GETTING LEADERS WERE MAKING THEY WERE DRIVING AROUND AND- ENERGY WAGONS THROUGH THE CENTRAL VALLEY THEY HAD NO IDEA BUT THAT JUST GIVES YOU A SMALL GLIMPSE OF THE FINANCIAL COMPONENT TO THIS. SO OUR GOAL IS TO FOCUS ON ENTERPRISES IS IN PEOPLE THAT ARE ORCHESTRATING THIS THIS. TYPE OF CRIMINAL ACTIVITY. ESPARTO IMPAIR. THERE'S ALWAYS A RESTORE- TO TRY TO WORK ON THOSE ISSUES AS A GROUP. THANK YOU AND MISTER CORK AS A QUESTION YUP WE DON'T HAVE-A LOT O TIME SO I'LL JUST MAKE A SHORT STATEMENT- THE UNFORTUNATE PART OF THIS DISCUSSION IS 80% OF IT WAS SPENT ON SEX TRAFFICKING. AND SEX TRAFFICKING IS THE EASIEST THING FOR ENFORCEMENT TO DO BECAUSE IT'S OUT IN THE OPEN. BUT 80% OF THE PROBLEM IS REALLY LABOR TRAFFICKING. AND THERE'S REALLY FROM WHAT I CAN TELL NOT A BIG EFFORT THERE. SO- OFTEN IT'S HIDDEN IT'S A MADE TO DOESN'T HAVE PAPERS AND WORKS EIGHTEEN HOURS A DAY SEVEN DAYS A WEEK FOR NO PAY. AND IT'S SOMETHING WHICH IS NOT SPENDING ENOUGH TIME ON. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. HELLO ALLOWED THE OTHER MEMBERS TODAY ONE ANY OPENING ANY OPENING COMMENTS MISTER BRYANT REFLECT THE- THEY WANT TO MAKE IT. A GOOD. WELL JUST STATE THE OBVIOUS THAT THIS IS A- THIS IS A BIG SCOURGE FOR OUR SOCIETY TODAY AND I DON'T THINK ANY OF US UP HERE HAVE AN IDEA AS TO HOW. PROLIFIC AND HOW- UGLY. THIS PROBLEM REALLY IS I MEAN AND IT'S NOT JUST IN. IN THE URBAN ENVIRONMENT EITHER IT IT'S ALL OVER AND- WE HAVE SOME VERY SOPHISTICATED OPERATIONS THAT ARE TAKING PLACE AND SO I'M I'M HAPPY TO HEAR THE DOJ'S PARTNERING. AND- BUT I HEARD MENTION THAT THE STATE CONNECTIVITY IS LACKING AND I THINK THAT- THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THAT'S OUR JOB TO TRY TO HELP FACILITATE THAT AND I HOPE THAT AS A RESULT OF THIS HEARING THAT WERE. WE BECOME MORE AWARE AND- WE CAN BECOME A PARTNER IN TRYING TO- RIVERSIDE OF THIS VERY TERRIBLE CIRCUMSTANCE. THANK YOU. MISTER ISAAC D. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN JUST REALLY GRATEFUL FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP IN CONVENING THIS REALLY IMPORTANT HEARING ABOUT THIS REALLY IMPORTANT TOPIC THE STATE HAS- ATTENDED TO ADDRESS THIS IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS I'M REALLY PROUD OF THE SAFE HARBOR LAWS IN OTHER WAYS THAT WE'VE LOOKED AT THIS. THROUGH THE YEARS. IT IS- I THINK WE ALSO NEED TO CONTINUE TO LOOK AT ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY AND INCLUSION IN OTHER PARTS OF OUR- LEGISLATIVE PACKAGES SO THAT WE CAN FIGURE OUT HOW WE TIE ALL OF THESE THINGS TO THE NEEDS OF OUR COMMUNITY. BUT I'M GRATEFUL TO THE- PRISONERS TODAY SO FAR LOOKING FOR TO THE FULL CONVERSATION. THANK YOU. ADULT INTERNET THANK YOU MISTER MARCH WE'RE GOING TO GO ON TO OUR NEXT PANEL. AND THAT WOULD BE- WE HAVE KIMBERLY FOSTER FROM THE CRIME VICTIMS FOR SAFETY AND JUSTICE AND DR GRIFFITH A SURVIVOR CONSULTANT LOYOLA LAW SCHOOL- SUNITA JANE- ANTI TRAFFICKING POLICY INITIATIVE.

COGNISANT YOU HAVE OTHER PRESENTERS. I'M SORRY I SAID KIMBERLY FOSTER WE HAD A CHANGES TINA. AB ONE WHICH- TINA RODRIGUEZ I GRABBED THE WRONG SHE. YEAH. IN GETTING TO THE PREVIOUS MY NAME'S ADRIANA GRIFFITH FELKER. TINA REMOTELY. YES CAN YOU HEAR ME YES. YOU MAY BEGIN WARNING MORNING. MS RODRIGUEZ YOU MAY BEGIN YOUR TESTIMONY AT THE GIVE ABOUT FIVE MINUTES OR SO. THANK YOU I'M. I'M HAPPY TO BE HERE TO BE ABLE TO HEAR DISCUSSION ABOUT- THAT SOME OF THE HARDSHIPS AND SURVIVORS ARE EXPERIENCING WHAT I WILL SHARE WITH YOU THE L. IS UNFORTUNATELY A STORY FROM A SURVIVOR THAT IT'S CONTINUED TO BE SCREENED OUT OF SERVICES AS SHE IS IN. A SITUATION THAT IS NOT VERY STATE BANK SHE'S DOING EVERYTHING THAT SHE CAN'T TO TRY AND ACCESS RESOURCES- KIMBERLY WAS GOING TO SPEAK THIS MORNING BUT ASKED ME TO SHARE HER STORY FOR HER- SHE IS A SURVIVOR AND OUR MEMBER NETWORK OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND FOLLOWING THAT THE DEATH. OF HER. SORRY I HIT SOMETHING HERE BUT- WE CAN HEAR THAT YES THAT THIS SOMETHING HAPPENED WITH THIS- DEVICE BUT THAT FOLLOWING THE DEATH OF HER MOTHER SHE SPIRALED INTO DEPRESSION AND- STRUGGLED WITH A LIFE PATH FROM THERE. ARE RECRUITED INTO TRAFFICKING BECAME A MATTER AT JUST LIKE IT WAS DESCRIBED EARLIER BY BY THE GENTLEMAN THAT SPOKE I THINK HIS NAME WAS JOHN. MARSHALL THERE DIED TRAPPED IN A SITUATION WHERE WE'RE YOUR FAMILY WE CONTROL EVERYTHING AND YOU'LL SPEAK AND TALK TO WHOEVER WE CHOOSE YOU SPEAK AND TALK. TO AND CONTROLLING ENVIRONMENTS. SO WE- GEOGRAPHICAL. TO REDUCE THE SUPPORT SYSTEM ARE BASICALLY ISOLATE FROM THE SUPPORT SYSTEM WAS AN IMMEDIATE- AND IMMEDIATE GROOMING I THAT TOOK PLACE TO MAKE SURE THERE WAS NO WAY TO ESCAPE- THE SITUATION THAT SHE'S BEEN IN. AND OUT SHE APPLIED FOR VICTIM COMPENSATION AND THAT IS AND CONTINUES TO TRY AND GET ASSISTANCE- THE RESPONSE TIME AT THAT THE LACK OF TIME SENSITIVITY TO URGENT CRISIS MATTERS NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED THEY CAN HELP BENEFIT TO INCREASE THE STATE THING. ESPECIALLY IN CRISIS SITUATIONS LIKE HERS WHERE THERE IS AN EFFORT TO AND THE ONE OPPORTUNITY TO ESCAPE- A GET AWAY IS. VITAL TO STAY ALIVE AND WHEN THAT DOES HAPPEN IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO HAVE A RESPONSE IN PLACE THEY REALLY AMPLIFY SEEKING PROTECTION IN THOSE MOMENTS IT IS DIFFICULT. TO BE HOMELESS. AND NO DATE THAT YOU'RE TARGETED OR FOR SPEAKING IN FOR NEEDING AND THESE TRAFFICKERS JUST LIKE IT WAS DESCRIBED EARLIER WE'LL SEND PEOPLE OUT TO LOOK FOR YOU- AT SEARCH FOR YOU STOCK. THREATEN OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY IT'S DIFFICULT TO ESCAPE AND WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO WATCH IT HERE AND JUST KNOW THAT- YOU KNOW WE ARE. FEARFUL OURSELVES TO SEE- YOU KNOW THAT THAT AMOUNT OF FEAR AND THREATS THERE BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT WE ALSO SEE OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO IMPROVE OUR RESPONSE. AND WE REALLY WANT TO BE MAKING SURE THAT WE INCREASE AWARENESS AROUND THAT AND THAT WE EXPEDITE OF REQUESTS FOR SERVICES WHEN THEY WHEN THEY DO PRESENT THEMSELVES. SO MAKING SURE THAT- YOU KNOW THAT THAT WE INCREASE RESPONSE TIME WHEN SURVIVORS ARE ASKING FOR HELP FOR THE FOR THE MENTAL HEALTH SPECIFICALLY FOR THE HOUSING MENTAL HEALTH AND- AND HEALTH CARE. WITH SURVIVORS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING WE HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND THAT RIGHT NOW WE'RE IN A PANDEMIC AND SO IT'S NOT LIKE BEFORE WHERE SURVIVORS. COULD JUST WALK INTO AN EMERGENCY HEALTH CLINIC AND BE SEEN- DATE THERE'S USUALLY A SCREENING ARE SOMETIMES THEY'RE TOLD TO CALL THIS NUMBER WELL IF THEIR PHONE'S BEEN TAKEN AWAY FROM THEM AND THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED TO SPEAK FREELY THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE. SEOUL ARE REMOVING SOME OF THESE BARRIERS IS VERY IN A- VERY IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW IT'S A DISCUSSION WE NEED TO HAVE AND HELPING CAL BASICALLY UNDERSTAND THAT- SURVIVORS THAT ARE HOMELESS DON'T HAVE A MAILING ADDRESS TO GET THESE DOCUMENTS. AND WHEN YOU'RE IN A STATE OF CRISIS AND YOU SEE THESE THINGS YOU DON'T HAVE AN ADDRESS- TRYING TO GET COMMUNICATED AS BEST AS YOU CAN WITH NO DEVICE- NO INTERNET ACCESS OVER TIME IS VERY CHALLENGING. AND I ENCOURAGE AT A CONTINUED EFFORT. TO INCREASE THESE MATTERS. THANK YOU MISTER. NECK THE ATRIA GRIFFITH. GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING. THANK YOU COMMITTEE FOR PROVIDING SPACE THIS MORNING FOR ME TO SHARE MY JOURNEY WITH YOU ALL AND WHY BELIEVE IN NON PERSONAL APPROACHES TO HUMAN TRAFFICKING. MY NAME IS ADRIANA GRIFFITH AND I LIVE IN STOCKTON CALIFORNIA WHERE OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS I HAVE PROVIDED DIRECT SERVICES TO VICTIMS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING. NOT ONLY HAVE I BEEN ABLE TO WITNESS THE FAILURES OF OUR CRIMINAL LEGAL SYSTEM IN THE LIVES OF THOSE I SERVE. BUT I'VE ALSO EXPERIENCED THAT FIRST HAND SEVERAL TIMES AND THE SAME QUESTION AS ALWAYS POSE. WHAT MADE ME SO VULNERABLE THAT I BECAME A VICTIM OF THIS THING CALLED HUMAN TRAFFICKING. MOST STORIES INVOLVE BEING ABUSED OR NEGLECTED AS A CHILD. AND NAVIGATING THROUGH THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM. MY JOURNEY DOES NOT START THAT WAY. I GREW UP WITH BOTH OF MY PARENTS IN THE SAME HOUSEHOLD. IT WAS A HOME FILLED WITH LOVE AND HAPPINESS BUT IT WAS ALSO A HOME THAT EXPERIENCE CONFLICT. PAIN AND THE CHALLENGES THAT OFTEN ACCOMPANY LIFE. I WASN'T ABUSED IN MY HOME BUT I FREQUENTLY WITNESSED MOMENTS THAT MADE ME FEEL LESS TRUSTING AND LESS SAFE. WHEN IT CAME TO THOSE AROUND ME. THESE MOMENTS ARE OFTEN CHARACTERIZED BY COMBAT OF ARGUMENTS AND DUE TO THE SYSTEM INVOLVEMENT OF SOME OF MY SIBLINGS POLICE INTERACTIONS. ONE MOMENT IN PARTICULAR THAT STANDS OUT THAT NO CHILD SHOULD EVER EXPERIENCE AS HAVING LAW ENFORCEMENT ARMED WITH ASSAULT WEAPONS BURST INTO MY HOME AND POINT A GUN AT ME AS IF I WERE A THREAT TO PUBLIC SAFETY. I WAS ELEVEN YEARS OLD. NO ONE WAS ARRESTED THAT DAY AND AFTER HAVING TRAUMATIZED EVERYONE PRESENT THEY LEFT CALLING IT A PROBATION SEARCH. THERE WERE NO SUPPORT OF SERVICES OFFERED TO ME AFTER THAT. AND I WAS LEFT TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO COPE ON MY OWN DESPITE THE SYSTEM KNOWING IT HAD CONTACTED A MINOR AND SUCH A HORRENDOUS WAY. AS ITRANSITION FROM CHILDHOOD INTO MY TEENAGE YEARS. I BEGAN TO EXPERIENCE FEELINGS OF DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY. WHEN I WAS SIXTEEN I BEGAN TO SELF HARM AS A METHOD OF COPING WITH THOSE FEELINGS. GIVING ME A SENSE OF POWER AND CONTROL BECAUSE I FELT LIKE I HAD NONE. I HAD MOVED AWAY FROM THE ONLY HOME I'D EVER KNOWN AND OFTEN FELT LIKE I JUST DID NOT BELONG. WHEN I WAS NINETEEN AFTER GETTING MY FIRST BOYFRIEND AND FALLING IN LOVE FOR THE FIRST TIME. I BECAME PREGNANT. THIS WAS ALSO THE SAME AGE I EXPERIENCED MY FIRST BREAKUP AND HEARTBREAK. I ULTIMATELY MADE THE INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT CHOICE TO HAVE AN ABORTION. AFTER WHICH I FELT INCREDIBLE GUILT AND SHAME. I WASN'T PREPARED THE MENTAL ANIMAL AND OF THIS. IT LEFT ME AND A STATE. BUT STILL WAS NO FOLLOW UP CARE BY MY OR HEALTH PROVIDERS. DESPITE HAVE A HISTORY OF MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS IN MY FAMILY AS WELL AS ADDICTION. ONCE AGAIN I WAS LEFT TO COPE ON MY OWN AFTER COMING IN CONTACT WITH THE SYSTEM THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT HELPING PEOPLE. NINETEEN WOULD ALSO BE THE YEAR I'M INTRODUCED TO THE WORLD OF SEXUAL EXPLOITATION. MY EXPERIENCE HOWEVER WAS NOT THE MAINSTREAM EXPERIENCE OFTEN PORTRAYED IN OUR SOCIETY. AT THIS TIME IN MY LIFE I WAS EXTREMELY DEPRESSED AND LOOKING FOR A WAY TO ESCAPE THE REALITY OF ME. THE FAST PACED WORLD THAT FACILITATED EXPLOITATION GAVE ME THAT ESCAPE. IT GAVE ME A RASH AND THE SENSE OF BELONGING. THIS WORLD GAVE ME OF THE ABILITY TO BE SOMEONE NOW. SOMEONE WHO DIDN'T REMIND ME OF WHO I USED TO BE AND COULD NEVER BE AGAIN. FROM NINETEEN TO TWENTY TWO I WAS TRAFFICKED AND SEXUALLY EXPLOITED BY THREE DIFFERENT PEOPLE. EACH PERSON WAS DIFFERENT AND EACH RELATIONSHIP WAS DIFFERENT. ONE WAS THE BUSINESS TYPE ONE WAS THE ROMEO TYPE AND THE OTHER WAS MY BOYFRIEND. THE LAST EXPERIENCE I HAD WAS WITH MY BOYFRIEND. IT WAS WITH HIM THAT I HAD THE MOST INTENSE RELATIONSHIP OF ALL. IT WAS CHARACTERIZED BY VIOLENCE GAS LIGHTING AND MANIPULATION AND WAS EXTREMELY TOXIC FOR BOTH OF US. AFTER A FEW MONTHS WE BEGAN USING ALCOHOL AND DRUGS MORE FREQUENTLY. WE INSERTED OURSELVES BACK INTO THE CULTURE OF PARTYING LIKE ROCK STARS AND SOON AFTER I FOUND MYSELF ENGAGING AND STREET AND ONLINE PROSTITUTION. WHEN I WASN'T HAVING SEX FOR MONEY I WAS COMMITTING PETTY THEFT AT THE MALL TO KEEP MONEY COMING IN. THIS WAS EXPECTED AS PART OF THE LIFESTYLE. IT DIDN'T STOP THERE HOWEVER I WAS ALSO ENCOURAGED AND SOMETIMES FORCED TO ENGAGE IN PHYSICAL ASSAULTS TO OTHERS FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS. THIS UNFORTUNATELY ALSO MEANT PARTICIPATING IN THE TRAFFICKING AND EXPLOITATION OF OTHER PEOPLE WHEN I WAS ARRESTED AND CHARGED WITH PIMPING PANDERING AND A RANGE OF OTHER CHARGES FROM ASSAULT TO KIDNAPPING. MY CO DEFENDANT WAS ALSO THE PERSON WHO TRAFFICKED AND EXPLOITED ME COUNTY JAIL FIGHTING MY CASE ANALYTICS ULTIMATELY SENTENCED TO STATE PRISON FOR A TERM OF FIVE YEARS. I SERVE THE REST OF MY TIME UNDER THE CONTROL OF CDCR. BEFORE COMING HOME IN TWENTY FIFTEEN. THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE TIME I WAS INCARCERATED. I WAS NEVER PROVIDED WITH ANY SERVICES OR SPACE TO BE ABLE TO SELF IDENTIFY AS A TRAFFICKING VICTIM DESPITE HAVING COME IN CONTACT WITH AN ENTIRE LEGAL SYSTEM. INSTEAD I WAS ONCE AGAIN LEFT TO SILENTLY COPE WITH WHAT I HAD EXPERIENCED. THE SYSTEM NEVER SAW ME AS A VICTIM. THIS WAS EVIDENT AND ONE OF MY VERY FIRST ENCOUNTERS WITH CDC ARE. IN A COMMITTEE HEARING WHEN BEING ASSIGNED TO A PRISON LABOR ASSIGNMENT I WAS ASKED BY LIEUTENANT WHY I HAD DONE WHAT I'VE DONE. I SIMPLY TOLD HIM I WAS TRYING TO SURVIVE. THAT IF I DIDN'T DO WHAT WAS ASKED THE CONSEQUENCES WOULD BE WORSE. AND NOT SO MANY WORDS HE TOLD ME THAT MY ACTIONS DIDN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. BECAUSE LOOK WHERE IT GOT ME. THEY LOOKED AT ME WITH DISGUST AND SHAME. AND I LEFT THAT ROOM FEELING LIKE THE WORST PERSON ON THE PLANET. PRESENT ITSELF IS SEXUALLY VIOLENT IN NATURE DEHUMANIZING AND INCONSIDERATE OF THE EXPERIENCES TRAFFICKING AND SEXUAL ABUSE SURVIVORS HAVE GONE THROUGH. I HAVE BEEN FORCED BY THE SYSTEM JUST STRIPPED COMPLETELY NAKED WHILE SOMEONE I DID NOT KNOW INSPECTED MY BODY AND THE MOST DEHUMANIZING WAY POSSIBLE. THIS WAS MY EXPERIENCE AS A SEXUAL ASSAULT AND TRAFFICKING SURVIVOR IN PRISON. FOR TOO LONG OUR COUNTRY HAS OPERATED IN A WAY THAT SAYS ACCOUNTABILITY EQUALS PRISON. AT PRESENT AS A DEHUMANIZING SYSTEM OF PUNISHMENT AND REVENGE AND IT DOES NOT FOSTER ACCOUNTABILITY OR HEALING FOR ANYONE INVOLVED. DESPITE BEING TRAFFICKED AND SEXUALLY ABUSED AND EXPLOITED. I HAVE SERVED MY TIME AND DONE TREMENDOUS WORK TO BE ACCOUNTABLE FROM MY PAST ACTIONS. BUT THE STATE HAS NOT BEEN ACCOUNTABLE TO ME. FOR THE LAST SEVEN YEARS SINCE COMING HOME I HAVE WORKED TO NOT ONLY UNDERSTAND WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO ME BUT TO ALSO MAKE SURE DOESN'T CONTINUE TO HAPPEN TO OTHERS. SO MUCH PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE WHEN IT COMES TO THE ACCESS THAT SURVIVORS HAVE. WHEN IT COMES TO JUSTICE. BUT UNFORTUNATELY THIS THE STATE HAS DECIDED TIME AND TIME AGAIN. THAT ACCESS DOES NOT APPLY TO ME OR OTHERS LIKE ME. BECAUSE OF MY PREVIOUS CONVICTION I AM AN ELIGIBLE FOR RECORD EXPUNGEMENT OR VACATE A RELEASE. SO WHILE THE STATE CONTINUES TO RECOGNIZE. AND PASS LEGISLATION THAT RECOGNIZES HUMAN TRAFFICKING VICTIMS ARE AT TIMES FORCED INTO OTHER ACTS OF CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR IT CONTINUES TO LEAVE THOSE LIKE ME OUT OF THE EQUATION. WHAT THIS COMMUNICATES TO ME IS THAT ONLY SOME SURVIVORS ARE WORTH CARING FOR AND OTHERS ARE NOT. SURVIVORS DO NOT COME IN A ONE SIZE FITS ALL MODEL. WE ARE ALL DIFFERENT. WITH DIFFERENT NEEDS AT DIFFERENT STAGES OF HEALING AND WITH DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES. THE APPROACH TO HELPING SURVIVORS NEEDS TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND HOLD SPACE FOR THOSE DIFFERENCES. WHAT MADE ME VULNERABLE TO TRAFFICKING WAS BEING SYSTEM IMPACTED FROM A YOUNG AGE HAVING AN ABORTION WITHOUT PROPER MENTAL HEALTH CARE IN THE AFTERMATH. IT WAS BEING ANGRY AND FEELING A LACK OF POWER AND CONTROL. IT WAS THE MESSAGES I GOT FROM MUSIC TV MOVIES. BUT MOST OF ALL THE VULNERABILITY WAS NOT HAVING A SPACE TO PROCESS ALL OF THAT IT THE THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED TO ME. WHEN WE HAVE A SYSTEM THAT REFUSES TO ACKNOWLEDGE A PERSON'S ENTIRE SELF AND THE CHALLENGES THEY FACE. WE CONTINUE TO SOLVE ONLY HALF THE PROBLEM. AND WHETHER INTENDED OR NOT. WE CONTINUE TO PERPETUATE CYCLES OF HARM. OUR CURRENT SYSTEM OPERATESBY LOOKING AT WHAT A PERSON IS DYING AND DECIDING WHAT PUNISHMENT THEY DESERVE. BUT IT DOES NOT ASK THE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION WHICH IS WHAT DOES THIS PERSON NEED IN ORDER TO NO LONGER CAUSE HARM OR EXPERIENCE HARM. THIS IS WHAT IT MEANS TO APPROACH THIS ISSUE FROM A NON PUNITIVE INTERSECTIONAL LENS. THIS APPROACH MATTERS TO ME BECAUSE I STAND AT THE INTERSECTIONS OF LIFE. I AM MADE UP OF MULTIPLE EXPERIENCES AND IDENTITIES. I AM A DAUGHTER A SISTER AND AUNTS. A FORMERLY INCARCERATED SURVIVOR. A SURVIVOR OF LIFE. AND A SURVIVOR OF THE SYSTEM. IN EACH ONE OF THOSE IDENTITIES IS EQUALLY AS IMPORTANT AS THE NEXT MORNING. IN THANK YOU AND GOOD COULD YOU STERANKO YOU WILL HAVE QUESTIONS AND- THANK YOU FOR YOUR VERY PASSIONATE HAND WRITTEN- TESTIMONIES SHE THAT IS FROM YOU AND FROM YOUR HEART. AND BEFORE WE GO ON- I KNOW MISS MISS FOSTER COULDN'T COULDN'T BE APPRECIATED DEATH IN THE FAMILY I WOULD LIKE HER TO KNOW THAT THIS THIS COMMITTEE. CENTER CONDOLENCES BECAUSE IN MANY WAYS BY IS NOT ACKNOWLEDGING PEOPLE'S PAIN.

ACTIVE ON IMMIGRATION STATUS OR GENDER IDENTITY OVERLAP AND EXPERIENCES OF MARGINALIZED GROUPS. IF YOU NEED TO CHANGE ANTI TRAFFICKING INITIATIVES IMPLORED STAKEHOLDERS TO SHIFT THEIR FOCUS ON PUBLIC COMMENT FORTUNATE TO PUBLIC HEALTH AND COMMUNITY BASED APPROACH TO ADOPT AN INTERSECTIONAL RAN TO THE SURVIVOR EXPERIENCE. AND WHO LOOK AT THE RED CAUSE OF WHAT MAKES SOMEONE VULNERABLE TO TRAFFICKING. FOR EXAMPLE WHEN WE LOOK AT THE INTERSECTION ALITY OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND HOW THAT MAKE THEM UNVIABLE TO TRAFFICKING CLIMATE DISASTERS CARS LARGELY AND PEOPLE AND RUN YOUR ENTIRE NEIGHBORHOOD COMPLEX KATRINA AND HURRICANE. THANK MONIQUE. YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY BONE TO ACTUALLY. ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF INTEREST AT ALITY IN GERMAN TRACK IF THE ROLE OF BIG AND MEDIA IN ALLOWING THE OF MAKING ABOUT TRACK. SUCH AS WITH THE TRAVELING AQUINO IT ONLY TO BE DONE AFTER THAT FALL OUTSIDE IT MEANS CARE HI. EIGHTY AGAIN FOR TO THE TIME TO UNDER YOUR OF TRAP AND SPEAKING ESPECIALLY FROM. ACTED AND DELTA AND OR CONCERNS. THANK YOU- WE'RE NOW. BRING IT TO THE FOR QUESTIONS ARE FORCED REYES STATE- BUT FIRST THE WHEN I FROM THE VICTIMS. ON MY RECENT. A WANT TO PURSUE HER ABOUT THE THESE TO USED TO LIKE- HUMANS WHO TRAFFICKING SLAVERY AND I RECENTLY JUST SAW RESULT THE MOVIE ABOUT TWELVE YEARS JUST. AND IT WAS A SOMEONE THAT WAS. THAT ALL OF A SUDDEN. GOT ALL THAT TAKEN AWAY FROM THEM HE WAS A SLAVE. ALL OF THE METHODOLOGY THE PROCEDURES SEEM VERY SIMILAR. TO HUMAN TRAFFICKING. TAKING YOU AWAY FROM YOUR FAMILY- BECOMING A PROPERTY YOUR PROPERTY OF A GROUP OF A PERSON OR GROUP OF PEOPLE. AND FOR ANOTHER HUMAN BEING TO TREAT ANOTHER HUMAN BEING THAT WAY PROBABLY THE MOST HEINOUS THING THAT COULD HAPPEN IS ONE REASON I WANT TO HAVE. THIS HEARING TO LET PEOPLE KNOW THAT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE PARTICIPATING IN THIS ARE PROBABLY THE COOLEST MOST INHUMANE INDIVIDUALS MAY BE EVEN ON THE PLANET. AND- THAT'S WHY WE'VE GOT TO GET TO THE ROOT OF IT BECAUSE YOU BECOME TRAUMATIZED AFTER YOU'VE ALREADY BEEN TRAUMATIZED IN THE PLAY ON THAT. TO KEEP CONTROL AS THEY DID WITH US SLAVES IN THE SOUTH TO KEEP HIM FROM RUNNING AWAY. TO KEEP THEM FROM REVOLTING IF YOU DID SOMETHING YOU COULD BE SERIOUSLY INJURED. ARE YOU COULD BE KILLED AND SELL OUT THAT KEPT THAT WHOLE SYSTEM TOGETHER. AND SO- WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT IN OUR HEARD FROM SEVERAL OF THE PALACE ANY OFF RAMPS ARE PLACES YOU CAN GO IMMEDIATELY BECAUSE IN MY TIME IS REALLY IMPORTANT. THAT ALMOST LIKE THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD DO WE NEED TO BUILD A UNDERGROUND RAILROAD FOR HUMAN TRAFFICKING WE CAN GET. THESE INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED IN THIS OUT OF IT QUICKLY WE CAN GET HIM TO A SAFE PLACE AND WE KEEP THEM AWAY FROM THE PERPETRATORS IS THAT SOMETHING WE NEED TO INVEST MORE MONEY IN. THIS SOMETHING THAT WE REALLYNEED TO LOOK AT AND MAYBE EVEN I'M USING THE TERM UNDERGROUND RAILROAD BECAUSE- THAT WAS THE MOST EFFECTIVE THING AT THE TIME IT'S JUST SOMETHING WE NEED AT THE STATE. TO CORRECT THAT KIND OF RAILROAD TO GET PEOPLE OUT OF THAT THAT SYSTEM DOES THAT MAKE ANY. ANY SENSOR HELP. I WAS NABBED PANEL ANSWERED IN THE SOCIETY IN MISTER BRYANT. ANYONE FROM THE PANEL I CAN ANSWER SOME OF THE PATTERN SHARE SOME OF MY THOUGHTS ON THAT SO- SO I HEAR USE USING THE WORDS SLAVERY IN TERMS OF WHAT HAPPENED THE THREE FOUR HUNDRED YEARS AGO- BUT I ALSO WANT TO DRAW A COMPARISON TO. OUR OUR PRISON SYSTEM IN THE PRISON INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX AND THAT AND HOW THAT IS ALSO ROOTED IN SLAVERY- AND HOW ME AS A SURVIVOR OF EXPLOITATION. BECAME THE PROPERTY OF THE STATE. AND SO I DEFINITELY UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING- ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOWEVER. I DON'T THINK THAT IT'S NECESSARILY THE SAME CONTEXT AND HERE'S WHY I SAY THAT- MY PARTICULAR EXPERIENCE AGAIN WITH MY LAST EXPERIENCE WAS WITH MY BOYFRIEND THIS WAS SOMEBODY THAT I CARED ABOUT. SOMEBODY THAT DESPITE EVERYTHING THAT WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH EVERYTHING THAT HE'S DONE EVERYTHING THAT I'VE DONE I STILL CARE ABOUT THIS PERSON AS A AS A HUMAN BEING- AND SO IT'S NOT AS SIMPLE AS GETTING SOMEBODY AWAY FROM THE PERSON THE TIMING THEM. BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH I WAS SEPARATED FROM HIM WHILE INCARCERATED STILL VERY MUCH ATTACHED TO HIM- STILL VERY MUCH ATTACHED TO THE LIFESTYLE OF TRAFFICKING AND- SOME OF THE- BENEFITS OF THE REWARDS THAT I GOT OUT OF THAT WHICH IS A SENSE OF PRIDE A SENSE OF POWER AND CONTROL EXCEPT FOR US- AND SO I THINK THAT THAT THE ANSWER IS NOT. JUST GETTING SOMEBODY AWARE REMOVED REMOVING THEM FROM AN ENVIRONMENT BUT IT'S AGAIN REALLY LOOKING AT THE ROOT CAUSES OF THE BEHAVIOR ON NOT ONLY THE VICTIM OF THE SURVIVORS SIDE BUT ALSO ON THE EXPLOITER SIDE AS WELL- BECAUSE THERE ARE PEOPLE IN A LOT OF THE TIMES. WE COME FROM THE SAME COMMUNITIES WE COME FROM THE SAME NEIGHBORHOODS AND SO THERE'S NOT A HUGE POWER IMBALANCE THERE IS A GAME WHERE WE BOTH AND POVERTY WITH BOTH LACK OF EDUCATION OR WHATEVER THAT MIGHT BE- AND SO AGAIN I JUST THINK THAT THE ANSWER IS IT GETTING TO THE ROOT. OF WHY FOLKS. WHAT ARE PEOPLE GETTING OUT OF THE BEHAVIORS THAT THEY'RE DEALING BECAUSE WE'RE ALL GETTING SOMETHING OUT OF WHAT WE ENGAGE AND ESPECIALLY ON THE- ON THE EXPLOITERS SIDE BECAUSE I ALSO ENGAGED IN EXPLOITATION ON THAT SIDE OF IT- TO WHERE I CONVINCE PEOPLE TO. EXPLOIT THEMSELVES OR TO- STYLE THEMSELVES AS WELL- BUT IT WAS AGAIN I WAS LACKING A WHOLE LOT OF THINGS I WAS LACKING COPING SKILLS I WAS LACKING PEOPLE SKILLS. I WAS LACKING RELATIONAL SKILLS THERE IS A LOT OF THINGS THAT I WAS LACKING ON A BASIC HUMAN LEVEL. TO BE ABLE TO RELATE TO ANOTHER HUMAN BEING. AND THE WAY THAT OUR SOCIETY OPERATES AND SORT OF. LIKE RAISES ALL TO BE IS WE LEARN TO SEE EACH OTHER AS PRODUCTS AND NOT PEOPLE. AND IN THAT IS THE ISSUE- A LOT OF THIS STUFF IS ROOTED IN CAPITALISM AND- THIS PATRIARCHAL IDEAS OF POWER AND CONTROL AND WHO. GETS TO BE THE BOSS AND WHO DOESN'T- AND SO I THINK WE NEED TO ATTACK THOSE SPECIFIC SYSTEMS- AND REALLY WORK TO DISMANTLE THOSE SYSTEMIC HARMS. SO THAT WE DON'T CONTINUE TO PERPETUATE CYCLES BECAUSE AGAIN WE CAN CONTINUE TO INCARCERATE PEOPLE THAT'S NOT GOING TO STOP THE PROBLEM. WHAT IT'S A HUMAN PROBLEM AT THAT PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM AND IT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AT THAT WAY. NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED BY PROVIDING CARE TO. YOUNG BOYS AND YOUNG MEN WHO WE IDENTIFY AS HAVING SOME BEHAVIOR ISSUES AND WE NEED TO GET TO THE ROOT OF THAT. RECOGNIZING YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN AND GIRLS AND THE PEOPLE OF ALL GENDERS WHO STRUGGLE WITH ISSUES OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE OR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ISSUES. RIGHT BECAUSE THAT CAN ALSO TURN INTO AN EXPLOITIVE RELATIONSHIP. DEPENDING ON WHAT THE NEED IS- AND SO I THINK THOSE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT WHEN IT COMES TO ADDRESSING AND WHERE WE'RE PUTTING OUR FUNDING AND THINGS LIKE THAT WHEN IT COMES TO ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU. FOR SANTIAGO. FOR THE RECORD NUMBER OF COMMERCE. ALLOWED NUMBER. DAYS TWO. THREE FOUR FOUR MEMBERS OF TO SPEAK. A CUT IN FRONT OF THE PANEL GROUP WE'RE WE'RE FINISH WITH ALL THE TO. ON IN THIS SAID UPON- EACH SIDE SMALL THE- GO AHEAD AND HAS QUESTIONS AND I'LL BE COULD THAT THE SISTER IS BROKEN I DON'T I AGREE A 100% WITH WHAT YOU IN TURN OF HAVING MORE. OF THE FOR LACK OF BETTER WORD I'LL CALL IT SUPPORTS. I DON'T HAVE A BETTER THAN THAT NOT ALL YOU THE WAY- IF. OR HELP THEM GET AWAY BECAUSE IT'S WHAT YOU IT BUT WE'VE USED AND IN THE DOESN'T TO BE. EVEN A LOT TO GET YOUR- TO. WHAT LOOK AT TWENTY I THINK ANY TO THAT WE DEFINITELY HAVEN'T HAVE OPPOSED NOT NOT SUPPORT BUT BECAUSE I. WE EITHER. SO IT OR SUPPORT IT WOULD DOLLARS AND THEY HAVE THE SUPPORT OF A DOLLARS OF THEM AND IN ORDER FOR THEM TO HAVE ANY REAL IMPACT RIGHT AT THE BOTTOM LINE. THE SECOND THING IS WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT THE PREVENT THE PIECES AND I'M GLAD THAT YOU TOUCHED ON THAT BECAUSE THAT. IT WAS RUNNING INSIDE OF ME FIGURE OUT WHAT WHAT ARE THE RIGHT BECAUSE I THINK. YOU DID A CONVERSATION- THAT HAVE NOT EVER HEARD BEFORE- IT. ON THE HUMAN ASPECT OF NEED WHICH I THINK IS VERY POWERFUL- A. N. N. A. SIX. THAT QUESTION ABOUT PREVENTION. YEAH THE OTHER PIECE OF IT TO THE BECOMES VERY DIFFICULT I AM INTERESTED TO GET YOUR OPINION- BUT IT YOU KNOW AND I BATTLED WITH THE FROM THE LEGISLATURE AS WELL AND THE CURRENT COMMITTEE CHAIR IN THE PREVIOUS COMMITTEE CHAIRED HELPED US WITH US IN THIS COMMITTEES GRAPPLED ON IT. SO WE'VE TALKED ABOUT SUPPORT SERVICES FOR LACK OF BETTER WORD WE TALK ABOUT PREVENTION. BUT ULTIMATELY YOU BUMP UP AGAINST THE QUESTION A PROSECUTION. BECAUSE ITBECAUSE THESE ARE ALL THINGS THAT WE SHOULD DO THAT W HAVE TO DO. BUT IN ORDER TO STOP THIS ORGANIZED- CRIME THIS ORGANIZED EFFORT. WE'VE WE DO BUMP AGAINST WHAT THIS COMMITTEE HISTORICALLY HAS FOUGHT IN CRIMINALISATION ACTS. BECAUSE WE HAVE DONE WELL IN THE LEGISLATURE NOT NOT BUT WELL THE LEGISLATURE D. DECRIMINALIZE. CERTAIN ACCESS TO TRY TO FIX A BROKEN- CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM STOP WITH A BY STOP I USE THE BIG WERE PROSECUTION AND CLIMB UP THE LADDER STOP THE SO THAT'S KIND I MEAN WE'RE REALLY GOING TO BE DEALING WITH. SUPPORT SERVICES WHICH WHICH WHICH I'M A SERVICES BUT WILL NEVER WE TACKLE THE BIG PROBLEM. YOU KNOW WONDER WHAT YOUR PERSPECTIVE IS ON THAT BECAUSE IT'S ONE THING. TO DECRIMINALIZE ACCESS SHOULD NEVER INTERNALIZED TO BEGIN WITH IT AND I'M WITH YOU ON THAT AB BUT THEN HOW DO WE DEAL WITH THIS LAST PIECE. BECAUSE ULTIMATELY WHAT WE'RE SEEING. IS NOT GOING TO STOP UNLESS WE TAKE. ALL THE ACTIONS SAID HERE AND MANY MORE THIS ONE TO KIND OF GET YOUR IN. YOUR IMPROVE THE COMMISSION BUT FOR THAT MATTER I MEAN IT'S WORTH THE CONVERSATION REALLY GOOD POINT- AND I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT I'M UNDERSTANDING YOUR QUESTION IS. ARE YOU ASKING SPECIFICALLY ON LIKE MY THOUGHTS ON HOW PROSECUTION SHOULD WHAT PROSECUTION SHOULD LOOK LIKE. AND A NON CARCERAL SORT OF APPROACH OR- FOR THOSE NOT FOR THOSE WHO'VE EXPERIENCED HUMAN TRAFFICKING YEAH. BUT JUST ON THE OTHER SIDE OF ON THE OTHER SIDE AND I'M OUT THERE ENGAGING IN THE EXPLOITATION RECKON I'M NOT YOU KNOW. EVEN FOCUS ON THE QUOTE UNQUOTE BOTTOM LEVEL OF TOTAL BUT THAT THERE IS A NETWORK THAT THAT NEEDS TO STOP OR WE'LL NEVER. MAKE A DRINK AND- OR MET NEVER- REALLY FIGHT THIS BACK HOLY. YEAH SO I THINK THAT. YOU KNOW WHEN IT COMES TO. PROSECUTION OR- IN ALL DEALINGS THE FOLKS THAT ARE CAUSING THE HARM RIGHT- AND I THINK I'M JUST GONNA GO BACK TO WHAT I'M SAYING ABOUT. SORT OF PREVENTION AND MAYBE THIS IS MORE OF AN INTERVENTION- BUT THERE SHOULD BE. PROGRAMS I'M NOT SAYING THE HOLD FOLKS ACCOUNTABLE- BUT WHAT I'VE LEARNED THROUGHOUT MY JOURNEY AND THE WORK THAT I DO- IS THE ACCOUNTABILITY IS A PROCESS AND IT'S NOT SO MUCH OF. LIKE YOU DID SOMETHING BAD HERE'S YOUR PUNISHMENT NOT HOLD YOU ACCOUNTABLE RIGHT- YOU HAVE TO GET TO A PLACE OF ACCOUNTABILITY. WHERE IS YOU HAVE TO GET TO A PLACE OF UNDERSTANDING THE HARM THAT YOU CAUSE. THE HARM THAT THE OTHER PERSON EXPERIENCED IN THE IMPACT THAT THAT HAD NOT JUST ON THEM. BUT ON THE WHOLE COMMUNITY AS WELL AS THAT PERSON'S FAMILY AS WELL AND SO I THINK THAT IT'S STARTING WITH. AGAIN HOLDING FOLKS ACCOUNTABLE AND SAYING HEY THIS IS THE HARM THAT YOU BECAUSE BUT NOW WE'RE GOING TO WORK ON YOU. NOW WE'RE GONNA WORK ON HELPING YOU GET TO A PLACE OF UNDERSTANDING AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND MAYBE THAT LOOKS LIKE INSTITUTING MORE PROGRAMS WITH IN. PRISON UNTIL WE GET TO. THE PLACE WHERE WE NO LONGER HAVE THE NEED FOR PRISONS BUT IN THE MEANTIME I THINK THAT HAVING MORE PROGRAMS IN PLACE WHERE FOLKS ARE ABLE TO SORT OF PROCESS TO THESE HARMFUL. IDEOLOGIES AND- IDEOLOGIES THEIR MENTALITIES THAT THEY'VE HAD A GROWN ACCUSTOMED TO OUR GROWN UP WITH AS NORMAL- I THINK THAT THAT'S REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT AND I THINK THAT THAT IS A PIECE. THAT THE OTHER SIDE HAS BEEN LACKING- WE LOCK HOLDS UP AND WE DON'T ADDRESS ANY OF THAT AND AGAIN I'LL USE MY OWN MY OWN STORY AS AN EXAMPLE. WHEN I WAS INCARCERATED. NO ONE EVER ASKED ME ABOUT THE PERSON WHO ARE HARMED NO ONE EVER ASKED ME ABOUT THE IMPACT THAT THAT MIGHT HAVE HAD ON THEM. ON MYSELF AGAIN THINGS LIKE THAT WERE NOT ADDRESSED AND SO- THERE'S A LOT OF FOLKS THAT STAYED ON THE INSIDE HAVING NEVER. LEARNED ARE GETTING THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN THESE CONCEPTS UNTIL UNDERSTANDING GET TO A PLACE OF UNDERSTANDING WHY THEY DID WHAT THEY DID- AND I THINK THAT'S A PIECE THAT THAT NEEDS TO BE INCORPORATED. AND PROSECUTION UNTIL WE GET TO A PLACE IN SOCIETY WHERE WE NO LONGER HAVE ANY FOR PRESENCE BUT IF YOU. DON'T BUY- I LIKE TO GET TO THE OTHER I GOT A LITTLE AMBITIOUS BECAUSE WE FINISHED ABOUT. EIGHT MINUTES TO HAVE THE TIMES ARE START ASKING QUESTIONS OR- I SEE WE HAVE. ALL LOT SO I KNOW MISTER BRIAN HAS A QUESTION FOR THE COURT AND- RESPONSE COULD YOU HOLD ON ME GET TO. LAKE TO THEM WHICH IS DIVE RIGHT INTO JUST WHICH QUESTION. A GREAT. BURKE IT IS GOING TO GO TO NEXT TO GET THE MOTHER WAY HERE THEM AND THEY WE CAN. GO INTO QUESTIONING I JUST GOT A LITTLE TOO AND- ON. UNDER MY CELL. SO ON METAL MAC. ALLEN THANK PANEL IF YOU STICK A TO THE SONGS ARE FROM THE PANEL HERE- SERVING HERE MADISON MAC NATALIE MAY CHIEF DEPUTY IS THAT OFFICER. CALIFORNIA VICTOR COME. BOARD GOOD MORNING AND YOU CHAU SOME MEMBERS. AT IT'S INTERESTING TO HEAR THESE TESTING AND YOU KNOW HER ADDRESS STRAIGHT LAST STORIES ARE THESE ARE THINGS COME TO THE ARE GONNA QUITE THAT IN THE CURRENT RESTORED PROCESS A COMPENSABLE NO TWENTY FOURTEEN RESPECTS APPLICATIONS AND BEING ABLE TO COMPENSATE THESE FOLKS ARE BY WITH MEDICAL MENTAL HEALTH RELOCATION ALL THE BENEFITS THAT ARE HELPFUL TO VICTIMS HI CALIFORNIA AND. IT'S BEEN A VERY. SIX SESIL AND- THE EX THAT YOU CAN HAVE SUCCESS IN THE OF TRAGEDY RIGHT. I NEED SOME OF WHAT WE BIG. AND I'M GONNA SHOW. IT THEY SAID THAT. I CAN. BUT I'LL JUST TALKS. THIS GLOBAL DISH THIS WITH PROJECT SLIDE. SINCE THE DISTRICT CAN READ THE. HELLO WE A LOT OF ANSWERED ABOUT 89% WITHIN THE START. AND THAT'S QUITE HIGH BUT TO POINT ARE BEING MADE HERE. WE ARE A- ARE WE- REIMBURSEMENT PROGRAM WE ARE SOMEWHAT WHO COMES IN AFTER FACT AND A LOT OF WHAT WE'RE HEARING TODAY IS VERY DIFFERENT TO THAT AT YOUR JOB FOR WE HAVE TO HAVE CERTAIN TO MATT WE HAVE TO HAVE SOME VALLEY KNOW THAT THAT IS STRONG IN THIS AND WELL THE REASON THAT HAVE BEEN YOU KNOW I CAN TO CAN BE IN THE CONNECTION ON THE TOP TO THE TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE VICTIMS THEM. BUT FOR US. THERE ARE SOME THAT HAVE BE MET. WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DO. SOMEONE'S BEEN A HUMAN TRAFFIC. OR SEX. TRADE WORK VICTIM. AND SOME OF THE CHANNELS THAT HAVE. IN TIME. AND GETTING THE DOCUMENT JUST. THAT SOME OF THEM LOOKS LIKE- IT'S- NOT BEING ABLE TO GET PEOPLE ARE TRYING OR VICTIM AS- TO COME. WHEN THEY REACH ALREADY SO THAT WE GET AIM FOR AND GET THE NUMBER OF THEIR ENTIRE TO. OUR AND AGAIN THAT'S TIME COMPONENTS THAT FOLKS ABOUT. IT'S HARD TO FOLLOW UP AND TO DO THAT. ANOTHER TO COME THAT IS HAS BEEN A CHALLENGE FOR SOME OF OUR COST HAS BEEN GETTING DECLARATIONS THAT SHOW- THAT THEY WERE IN HUMAN TRAFFICKED. EARLY ON IN THE M. OF THE PRO SOME THE CHILD TO DELINEATE BETWEEN. HUMAN TRAFFICKING AS THE CRIMES VERSUS A MOLESTATION. SO WE GET RECORDS THAT SHOW- SOMEONE'S APPLYING HUMAN TRAFFICKING OR SEX VICTIM SOME SORT FOR EXAMPLE. THAT INDICATES THAT THIS IS A PERSON WHO'S HAD A BIG. MOLESTATION WELL. IF THE TWO CRIMES ALMOST HEINOUS AND BOTH COMPENSABLE WORK PROGRAMS THEY'RE COMPENSATED DIFFERENTLY BECAUSE HUMAN TRAFFICKING HAS THE DEPRIVATION OF LIBERTY COMPOUND WHERE YOU CAN BE COMPENSATED FOR TEN THOUSAND YEAR WITH. TWO YEARS ONCE GETS A TWENTY DOLLARS SO THERE ARE SOME NUANCES HIGH THINK THOSE NUANCES HAVE BEEN IRONED OUT OVER TIME LARGELY INVOLVED AND WE HAVE. FAR LESS CHALLENGES WITHOUT THEM USED TO- OVER THE COURSE OF THE IMPLEMENTATION SINCE THE CLINTON SESSION COMPONENT BECAME SEER THAT WE'VE PAID OUT ABOUT TWO POINT TWO MILLION. BUT THE STAFF SEARCHES I. IS WE'VE ONLY HAD ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY APPLICATIONS. WHICH IS A LARGE NUMBER BUT- LARGELY UNDERSTATES THE POPULATION HAS BEEN VICTIMIZED SO- WELL WE DO SURROUND REGION WE'VE GOT WEBSITE COMPONENTS YOU KNOW UPDATED OUR WEBSITE TO TRY TO MAKE IT EASIER MORE USER FRIENDLY SO PEOPLE CAN COME AND- SKATE BECAUSE AS- WE UNDERSTAND THAT RISKY ACCESS TO YOUR COMPUTER TO BE ABLE TO GET TO THAT- WE DO OUTREACH AS THROUGH THE ADVOCACY COMMUNITY WOULD PARTNER TRY TO MAINTAIN THIS OPEN COMMUNICATION. WE ARE IN FACT KEEPING PEOPLE APPRISED OF WHAT'S AVAILABLE TO THEM WHAT IT TAKES TO QUALIFY- AND HOW WE CAN BE OF ASSISTANCE HI WE HAVE A COMMUNICATION THAT GOES OUT MORNING EVERYONE'S CALLED MORNING COFFEE TO THE ADVOCATE COMMUNITY IN TRYING TO KIND OF SHARE THE NEWS OF WHAT'S AVAILABLE ON A PROGRAM THAT THESE BENEFITS ARE THERE WE HAVE SOCIAL MEDIA. OUT REACH OUT BUT THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE A NEED TO MAKE THIS COMMUNITY UNDERSTAND AND KNOW WHAT'S AVAILABLE TO THEM SO THAT WE CAN PROVIDE THE BENEFITS I GUESS THAT RARE IT NINE OUT OF TEN PEOPLE WHO COME THROUGH OUR PRIEST. AND THE ONES THAT AREN'T IT'S TYPICALLY WE CAN'T GET A HOLD OF FOLKS ARE WE CAN'T GET THE FOLLOW UP- WE CAN'T GET THE CONFIRMATION SO- I KNOW THERE'S AN INTEREST CHECKED FURTHER HISTORY MEANINGFUL CONVERSATION THAT'S UNDER WAY ABOUT SOLUTIONS BUT FOR KALBE C.'S LEAST SPACE WITHIN THIS I'D. SAY THAT. WE SHIP THAT WE HAVE. TO PROVIDING CONVICTED MY- I COME. IT'S NOT PLACING. IT IS YEAH. LOOK FORWARD DOING EVERY WE CAN SET. TO HELP THIS. AND PRETTY IT. OF ALL THE- PARTIES IN. AND EVERYONE WHO INTO THIS JUST. WITH THE INTENT OF MOVING FORWARD. THANK NOT WE'RE GOING TO THE TOP PAN SOON EVERYTHING IN THERE WILL STAY WITH A QUESTION OUR- AT THE THIS MARINE THE COR. DOES BILL BLAIR AND RICHER AND CYNTHIA. IN ANY ORDER THAT YOU WOULD LIKE. THANKS I'LL GET STARTED ARE WITH THE A PANEL YES THANK YOU NATALIE I MEAN MARIN WAS QUEEN. THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING JOE SAWYER THANK CHAIRMAN LACKEY AND ASSEMBLY. I AM WITH. A STUDENT HER WITH THE INTERNET HUMAN RIGHTS CLINIC AT THE U. S. SEQUEL SCHOOL OF LAW. ON NOVEMBER FIFTEENTH TWENTY TWENTY ONE OUR CLINIC PUBLISHED ONE OF THE FIRST COMPREHENSIVE REPORTS ABOUT US ANTI SEX TRAFFICKING LAW ENFORCEMENT OPERATIONS. THESE OPERATIONS OFTEN REFERRED TO AS RAIDS STINGS ARE SWEEPS INVOLVE LAW ENFORCEMENT WORKING UNDER COVER OR INVESTIGATING PRIVATE ESTABLISHMENTS TO IDENTIFY TRAFFICKED PERSONS AND PERPETRATORS. WE STARTED OUR INVESTIGATION IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN- WE ARE PROMPTED BY A LACK OF PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATA REGARDING LAW ENFORCEMENT ANTI SEX TRAFFICKING OPERATIONS SO IN ABOUT AN EFFORT TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THESE OPERATIONS WE CONDUCTED A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF RELEVANT LITERATURE. WE INTERVIEWED FORTY TWO PROFESSIONALS IN THE ANTI HUMAN TRAFFICKING FIELD INCLUDING FEDERAL AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT FEDERAL LOCAL PROSECUTORS LAW ENFORCEMENT ADVOCATES NONPROFIT ADVOCATES EXPERTS AND SURVIVOR ADVOCATES. WE ALSO FILED SIXTEEN FEDERAL AND STATE PUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS UNDER THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT AND THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RECORDS ACT. WE FOCUSED OUR STATE DATA COLLECTION ON CALIFORNIA FOR TWO MAIN REASONS FIRST GIVEN THE LOCATION OF THE INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS CLINIC AT USC IN LOS ANGELES MOST OF THE CLINIC'S EXPERTISE AND CONTACTS ARE IN CALIFORNIA. SECOND UNIQUE FEATURES OF ANTI SEX TRAFFICKING EFFORTS IN CALIFORNIA MAKE THE STATE AN INTERESTING CASE STUDY INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THAT CALIFORNIA HAS ONE OF THE HIGHEST RATES OF SEX TRAFFICKING IN THE U. S. HAS IMPLEMENTED PROGRESSIVE LEGISLATION AGAINST HUMAN TRAFFICKING. AND IS MODEL THAT STATEWIDE ANTI TRAFFICKING OPERATION CALLED OPERATION RECLAIM AND REBUILD AFTER FEDERAL OPERATIONS SUCH AS THE INNOCENCE LOST INITIATIVE. I TURN TO OUR MAIN CONCLUSIONS. IN OUR INVESTIGATION WE HEARD ENCOURAGING REPORTS OF THESE OPERATIONS BECOMING MORE EFFECTIVE AND MORE TRAUMA INFORMED OVERTIME. HOWEVER THE LITERATURE IN INTERVIEWS ALSO CONSISTENTLY INDICATED THAT THESE RATES ARE NOT THE BEST SOLUTIONS TO HELP PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING TRAFFICKED AND ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES COULD BETTER PROTECT VICTIMS STILL TAKE PROSECUTION OF TRAFFICKERS AND PREVENT TRAFFICKING. THE LITERATURE SUGGESTS THAT OPERATIONS IDENTIFY A FEW PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING TRAFFICKED EMPHASIZING THE OPERATIONS PRIMARILY TARGET SEX WORK AND TOO OFTEN TREAT VICTIMS PARTICULARLY BLACK VICTIMS AS CRIMINALS. WE HAVE REPORTS IN BOTH OUR INTERVIEWS AND LITERATURE THAT SOME OFFICERS TO CONDUCT OPERATIONS RECEIVED INSUFFICIENT VICTIM IDENTIFICATION TRAINING. THE LITERATURE ALSO INDICATES THAT OPERATIONS ARE SOMETIMES CONDUCTED WITH INSUFFICIENT PRE OPERATION INVESTIGATION OR WITHOUT EVIDENCE THAT THERE IS EITHER A MINOR INVOLVED BUT THAT THERE'S FORCE FRAUD AND COERCION INVOLVED. SIMILARLY OUR INTERVIEWS REPORTED THAT AND THEIR EXPERIENCE OPERATIONS TEND TO IDENTIFY FEW OR NO TRAFFICKERS AND ARE EXECUTED WITH INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO ARREST TRAFFICKERS AND OPERATIONS UNDERMINE REPORT WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING TRAFFICKED IN LINE FOR CEMENT. WHICH TENDS TO BE CRUCIAL TO SECURE TESTIMONY NECESSARY TO PROSECUTE TRAFFICKERS. AND EXPERT EXPLAINED THAT EVEN WITH THE BEST MOST TRAUMA INFORMED QUESTIONING PROTOCOLS THAT WE SOMETIMES SEE SELF IDENTIFICATION OF VICTIMS DURING OR IMMEDIATELY AFTER OPERATIONS REMAINS UNLIKELY AND I CAN BE BECAUSE OF THE ACUTE STRESS OF THE SITUATION OR A DISTRUST OF LAW ENFORCEMENT FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING TRAFFICKED. QUESTIONING DURING THIS TIME CAN ALSO BE TRAUMATIZING FOR VICTIMS IN ADDITION TO APPROVING EFFECTIVE. I'M INTERVIEWING LETTER DESCRIBED COURSE IN OFFICE SOMETIMES FOREGOING VICTIM CENTERED APPROACHES DURING OPERATIONS AND INSTEAD ARRESTING OR THREATEN TO ARREST INTERROGATING DOWNING ARE DOUBTING. BLAMING AND MISGENDERING TRAFFICKED PERSONS ON SOME OCCASIONS. TRAFFICKING SURVIVORS IN THE LITERATURE OF DESCRIBED REYES IS CHAOTIC AND OFTEN TRAUMATIC EVENTS THAT WE'VE BEEN FRIGHTENED OR CONFUSED WITH NO SENSE OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING OR WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM. AND A FEW VICTIMS IDENTIFIED DURING OPERATIONS MIGHT FACE POTENTIAL IMPRISONMENT ON THE BASIS OF A MATERIAL WITNESS WARRANT OR CRIMINAL CHARGE. A LAW ENFORCEMENT INVESTIGATOR WE INTERVIEWED RECOUNTED CHASING TRAFFICKED PERSONS DOWN THE HALLWAY OF HOTELS DURING OPERATIONS. AND HAVING ARMED SECURITY AT THE DOOR. A PUBLIC HEALTH I TO SEXUAL ABUSE BY LAW ENFORCEMENT DURING OPERATIONS AS PART OF THE TRAUMA OF BEING TRAFFICKED. THE NONPROFIT ADVOCATE WE INTERVIEWED DESCRIBED RAIDS AND NOT A PLACE WHERE YOU'RE RESTORING AUTONOMY TO SURVIVORS. ONE INTERVIEWING NOTED THAT ETHNIC DENTS HAVE TO BE HANDCUFFED AND POTENTIALLY INJURED TO BE HELPED PERHAPS OPERATIONS ARE NOT THE BEST WAY TO IDENTIFY AND INTERACT WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPERIENCING TRACKING. INDEED ONE OFFICER IN LITERATURE DESCRIBED QUOTE. WE ALMOST HAVE TO DO HE SAME GROOMING PROCESS THAT DEPENDED. A LOT OF TIMES THE VICTIMS ARE VERY ANGRY YOU KNOW THEY DON'T WANT TO BE PICKED UP ON CLOUT. DURING CERTAIN OPERATIONS UNDERCOVER OFFICERS INITIALLY POSED AS BUYERS LATER SURPRISING VICTIMS OFTEN ABRUPTLY AND WITHOUT WARNING WHAT THEIR TRUE IDENTITY. ONE SURVIVOR WE INTERVIEWED COMPARED THAT DECEPTION BY LAW ENFORCEMENT WITH HOW TRAFFICKERS MISLEAD THEIR VICTIMS WITH PROMISES OF MONEY LOVE AND SECURITY ONLY TO SURPRISE THEM WITH THE HARSH REALITY OF BEING TRAFFICKED. SURVIVORS SAID QUOTE TRAFFICKERS ARE OFTEN MAIL AND HAVE A POSITION OF POWER. TRAFFICKERS OF CHECKING COERCED THEM INTO TRUSTING THEM WHEN YOU HAVE LAW ENFORCEMENT WHO HAS DONE THE SAME THING SAID I'M THE BUYER AND THEN NOPE I'M ARRESTING YOU. THEY CHECKED ON LIKE THE TRAFFICKER UNQUOTE. AN INVESTIGATOR WE INTERVIEWED EXPRESSING FRUSTRATION WITH VICTIMS RELUCTANCE TO GET INFORMATION. ALSO STATED THAT THEY WILL SOMETIMES QUESTION PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING TRAFFICKED UNTIL THEY BREAK. FINALLY REGARDING OUR CONCLUSIONS OPERATIONS DO NOT ADDRESS FACTORS THAT MAKE PEOPLE VULNERABLE TO BEING TRAFFICKED AND ROUTINELY FAIL TO CONNECT SURVIVORS WITH THE SHORT AND LONG TERM SERVICES THAT ARE CRITICAL TO STABILIZATION AND PREVENTION EVERY TRAFFICKING. OPERATIONS THAT DO NOT ALLOW PERSONS WERE BEING TRAFFICKED TO CHOOSE WHETHER WHEN AND HOW THEY INTERACT WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN UNINTENTIONALLY REINFORCE THIS TRAFFICKERS NARRATIVE THAT WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING. THE NARRATIVE ABOUT LAW ENFORCEMENT INDIRECTLY TO SUPPORTING THE TRAFFICKERS ABILITY TO CONTROL AND COURSE VICTIMS ENEMIES WAYS L. PLANNED OPERATION BETTER NOT TRAUMA INFORMED ARE MORE LIKELY TO PERPETUATE THEM PREVENT SEX TRAFFICKING AND SYNDICATIONS. OUR INVESTIGATION ALSO IDENTIFIED ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES TO ANTI SEX TRAFFICKING OPERATIONS WHICH BY CENTERING SURVIVOR AUTONOMY WE CAN BETTER IDENTIFICATION OF TRAFFIC PERSONS AND BETTER OUTCOMES FOR SURVIVORS- IS A PURCHASE ANTI TRAFFICKING EFFORTS ARE TRENDING AWAY FROM USE OF OPERATIONS RATE STINGS AND SWEET. AND FOCUSING INSTEAD ON COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT PUBLIC HEALTH AND HARM REDUCTION STRATEGIES AND INVESTMENTS IN POVERTY RELIEF ANTI DISCRIMINATION INITIATIVES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR EDUCATION AND MPLOYMENT. AS SUCH A REPORT RECOMMENDS THAT FUNDING SHOULD BE USED TO INCREASE THE AVAILABILITY OF VICTIM SERVICES. INCLUDING SHELTER SPECIFICALLY FOR TRAFFICKING VICTIMS LONG TERM HOUSING WHICH MANY OF OUR INTERVIEWEES IDENTIFIED AS THE MOST CRUCIAL SERVICE. MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELING IMMIGRATION SERVICES LEGAL SERVICES EDUCATION AID JOB TRAINING PROGRAMS LIFE SKILLS TRAINING. SUBSTANCE ABUSE PROGRAMS AND SERVICES FOR THE CHILDREN OF TRAFFIC PERSONS. TO SUPPORT THIS AFTER LAW ENFORCEMENT SHOULD BUILD ITS RELATIONSHIPS WITH COMMUNITY NONPROFITS TO CREATE A NETWORK THAT CAN EFFECTIVELY PROVIDE VICTIMS WITH A WELL ROUNDED SET OF SERVICES INCLUDING HOUSING. THREE BASIC NEEDS SUCH AS FOOD AND CLOTHING CRISIS UNTIL HEALTH COUNSELING AS I MENTIONED IMMIGRATION SERVICES LEGAL AID SERVICES EDUCATION JOB TRAINING AMONG OTHERS. A FEDERAL PROSECUTOR WE INTERVIEWED AND DISCUSSING THE LINK BETWEEN TRAFFICKING AND NEGLECTED CHILDREN SHARED QUOTE WE CAN GET BETTER AT UNDERSTANDING HOW RECRUITMENT HAPPENS AND POOL INTELLIGENCE TO DEVELOP BETTER WAYS TO PROTECT PEOPLE. IN THE MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. HELLO ENFORCEMENT I WE A STATING. WHERE IT IS GO AND BOYS BEING FROM. AND HOW DO YOU STOP IT AND DO YOU SEEIT HOW DO YOU COMMUTE YOUR- TO PROTECT THE CHILDREN IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH THE COPS CAN DO AND FOR SOME OF THESE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR COPS ARE NOT THE ANSWER. AND QUOTE. WE ENCOURAGE THIS COMMITTEE TO SUPPORT COMMUNITY AND PUBLIC HEALTH APPROACHES TO IDENTIFY VICTIMS AND TRAFFICKERS OUTSIDE OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. THAT APPROACH REQUIRES SYSTEMATICALLY COLLECTING DATA RELATED TO EXPLOITATION. RESEARCHING TOPICS INCLUDING VICTIMIZATION RISK FACTORS AND IMPLEMENTING PROGRAMS FOR PREVENTING TRAFFICKING AND IDENTIFYING TRAFFICKING IN ITS EARLY STAGES. PART OF THIS APPROACH ENTAILS TRAINING HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS LIKE PHYSICIANS EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT WORKERS AND SOCIAL WORKERS TO IDENTIFY THE SIGNS OF TRAFFICKING IN PATIENTS AND TO OFFER RESOURCES TO SUSPECTED VICTIMS. OF FOR EXAMPLETHE SAN FRANCISCO DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH DISSEMINATES INFORMATION TO WORKERS IN MASSAGE ESTABLISHMENTS ABOUT ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. AND DIGNITY HEALTH A NONPROFIT THAT OPERATES HOSPITALS IN CALIFORNIA ARIZONA AND NEVADA HIGHER SURVIVOR ADVOCATES TO WORK IN HOSPITALS SINCE THEY FEEL THAT SURVIVORS MAYBE MORE SUPPORTED AND EMPOWERED BY OTHER SURVIVORS DONE BY LAW ENFORCEMENT OR DIFFERENT TYPES OF PROFESSIONALS REPORT WE'VE ALSO BEEN GRATIFIED BY FARTHER OUT OF REACH FROM THE ANTI TRAFFICKING COMMUNITY INCLUDING ADVOCATES IN OREGON WHO DESCRIBE OPERATIONAL PROCESSES WHERE SURVIVOR ADVOCATES AND DEFENSE ATTORNEYS ARE ALWAYS ON SITE TO MEET WITH INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE BEEN TRAFFICKED. LASTED ABOUT ONE LOCAL OFFICER WE INTERVIEWED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ANTI SEX TRAFFICKING EFFORTS QUOTE COMES DOWN TO PUBLIC AWARENESS. COMMUNITY NEEDS TO BE MORE EDUCATED ABOUT WHAT'S OCCURRING AND HOW PARENTS CAN BE EFFECTIVE AT PROTECTING THEIR KIDS. TO THAT END WE RECOMMEND BOWSTRING PREVENTION EFFORTS THAT REDUCE THE VULNERABILITY OF POTENTIAL VICTIMS AND TRAFFICKERS. FOR EXAMPLE ADVANCING RESEARCH ABOUT SEX TRAFFICKING RECRUITMENT STRATEGIES AND FACTORS THAT INCREASE VULNERABILITY TO TRAFFICKING. THIS RESEARCH APPEARS TO STRENGTHEN EARLY INTERVENTION PROGRAMS WHICH INVOLVES RAISING COMMUNITY AWARENESS AND EDUCATING YOUTH ABOUT HEALTHY INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS AND THE NATURE OF SEXUAL EXPLOITATION. I ONE SUCH STRATEGIES FOR SCHOOLS TO IMPLEMENT AS PART OF A BASIC CURRICULUM AT THE ELEMENTARY AND MIDDLE SCHOOL LEVEL. LESSONS ABOUT THE EXISTENCE OF TRAFFICKING THE RIGHT OF STUDENTS TO HEALTHY NON CORE CIRCULATION CHIPS AND HOW TO IDENTIFY AND SEEK HELP FROM TRUSTWORTHY ADULTS. AS PART OF A TWENTY EIGHTEEN STUDY OF SURVIVORS IN THE MIDWEST RAJARAM IN TEN BALL CONDUCT INTERVIEWS SURVIVORS MANY OF WHOM RECOMMENDED THAT ONE WAY TO SUPPORT VULNERABLE INDIVIDUALS. IS TO EDUCATE THEM FROM AN EARLY AGE ABOUT. THE DANGERS AND WARNING SIGNS OF TRAFFICKING. RAISING ON ABOUT SUCH TRAFFICKING ENABLES COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO IDENTIFY AT RISK YOU. PROVIDE THEM WITH ADDITIONAL SUPPORTS AND PROMPTLY REPORT EVIDENCE OF TRAFFICKING ITSELF. UNLIKE THE SHORTCOMINGS OF VICTIM IDENTIFICATION DURING OPERATIONS THAT ARE OFTEN CHAOTIC IS COMMUNITY LED APPROACHES BUILD RAPPORT WITH VICTIMS WHICH IN TURN MAKES VICTIMS MORE LIKELY TO DISCLOSE INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR TRACKING SITUATION WHICH AIMS PROSECUTION OF TRAFFICKERS. THESE APPROACHES ARE LAST HARMFUL TO VICTIMS BECAUSE THEY ALLOW VICTIMS TO MAINTAIN THEIR AGENCY COMMUNICATE WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT ON THEIR OWN TERMS AND THEY DO NOT RE TRAUMATIZE VICTIMS IN A WAY THAT OPERATIONS OFTEN DO. ACCORDING TO JIM STRICKER AND A TWENTY EIGHTEEN STUDY OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING AS A PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE QUOTE. HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS CHILD WELFARE WORKERS HOME CARE WORKERS. LEADERS LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSON ON SOCIAL SERVICE PROVIDERS AND VIRTUALLY EVERYONE ELSE WHO COMES IN CONTACT WITH THOSE WHO MAY BE AT RISK OF BEING TRAFFICKED CAN COMMUNICATE. PRIMARY PREVENTION FOCUSED MESSAGES THAT STRENGTHEN INDIVIDUAL KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS AND QUOTE. FINALLY WE RECOMMEND INVESTING IN ANTI POVERTY EFFORTS ANY DISCRIMINATION EFFORTS AND EDUCATIONAL AND EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES. IN THE SAME JIM STRICKER STUDY THE AUTHORS EXPLAIN CORE ECONOMIC LEGAL AND SOCIAL FACTORS INCLUDING POVERTY DISCRIMINATION AN ADEQUATE EDUCATION AND EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES. AND INSUFFICIENT PROTECTIONS FOR WORKERS MUST ALL BE ADDRESSED IN ORDER TO ELIMINATE AND REDUCE TRAFFICKING AND QUOTE. WELL I. DRESSING THE SYSTEMIC ISSUES IS NO SIMPLE FEAT MONEY TO PREVENT TRAFFICKING MAY BE BETTER SPENT FOR OPERATIONS THAT ARE FROM PREMATURELY AND FORCIBLY REMOVE THAT TENSION OR TRACKING SITUATION. WITH NO VIABLE. ALTERNATIVE AN INSUFFICIENT SOCIAL SUPPORT THAT MONEY WOULD BE BETTER SPENT ADDRESSING THE SYSTEMIC ISSUES. USING THESE NON TRAFFICKING CENTER SURVIVOR AUTONOMY AND BETTER SELF IDENTIFICATION AND OUTCOMES FOR SURVIVORS RESULT. WE URGE THIS COMMITTEE TO EMBRACE THESE APPROACHES AND MOVE AWAY FROM ONE PERSON OPERATIONS I THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND WELCOME YOUR QUESTIONS AFTER MY FELLOW PANELISTS HAVE SPOKEN. THANK YOU YOU MAY BEGIN. THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING HI MY NAME IS JOSEPH OFTHE GEL OF THE DIRECTOR OF POLICY AT THIS A GAME. AND TO HUMAN TRAFFIC. YES THIS BETTER GO THANK YOU- AGAIN GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS JOSEPH GALLAGHER PAULA AT THIS A JANE AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING POLICY NAY HELLO SCHOOL THIS HEARING COMES THE HEELS OF CELL HIM TRAFFICKING AWARENESS MONTH AND SO WE FOR THAT WE APPRECIATE THE CHAIR AND THE STAFF ARE WORKING TOWARDS CREATING A SPACE THAT BRINGS EXPERTS ACROSS DIFFERENT SECTORS TO PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS TO ENSURE THAT THE LEGISLATURE TAKES A COMPREHENSIVE AN INTERSECTIONAL APPROACH TO ADDRESS ALL FORMS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND MOST IMPORTANTLY TO PROVIDE A VEHICLE FOR IMPACTED INDIVIDUALS TO SHARE THE POWERFUL STORIES. MY REMARKS WILL GENERALLY TIED ON FOUR POINTS ONE AND APPROACH THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS TAKEN IN THE PAST DECADE. ALSO CA ST LAWS THE LACK FOR IMPLEMENT. I'M I WILL URGE- THIS COMMITTEE AND THE LEGISLATURE DUE TO MOVE POLICIES THAT HAVE TO BE CENTER ON ON SURVIVALS. AND LACK AND LASTLY ALSO- SUBMIT TO YOU THAT THERE IS A LACK OF LONG TERM VISION TO ADDRESS HUMAN TRAFFICKING FROM CALIFORNIA. MOREOVER HAVE EVERY POOR CAN RECENT REPORT BY THE STATE DEPARTMENT PUBLISHED IN JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE FOUND THAT THE PANDEMIC HAS PLACE VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES MORE AYE REYES OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING. AND IN SOME CASES RESULTED IN DECREASED OF INDIA LOCATION OF RESOURCES TO ASSIST VICTIMS BUT THEN ALSO TO CONTACT HUMAN TRAFFICKING. MY PREVIOUS COMMENTS SHED LIGHT ON THE FACT THAT CALIFORNIA HAS MADE SOME PROGRESS ABOUT WHAT WE ARE REALLY FAR FROM JULIET RESTING HUMAN TRAFFICKING. THE APPROACH THAT OUR STATE HAS TAKEN IN THE PAST DECADE IS ENOUGH FOR SPENT ONLY AND DETERRENCE ONLY APPROACH THAT TO SOME EXTENT HAS WORK. BUT ALSO A LACKS AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE COMPLEXITIES OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING. HOWEVER THESE BODY BUT AND THIS COMMITTEE HAS SHIFTED THAT MENTALITY AND HAS ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THIS APPROACH IS INSUFFICIENT. AND THAT SURVIVORS NEED MORE THAN OUR PRAYERS AND GOOD INTENTIONS. TO THAT END THE LEGISLATURE HAS INCREASED SERVICES- THE VICTIMS. OF FOR INSTANCE IN THE LAST BUDGET THANK DOZEN MEMBERS SAN DIEGO- THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS WERE ALLOCATED TO ENSURE THAT. SERVICE PROVIDERS WERE CONTINUE TO OPEN THE DOORS TO REGARDLESS OF WHERE WE WERE IN THE PEOPLE CONTINUE TO BE AND THE PANDEMIC HIS NATION HAS ALL PRO RELIEF FOR DOORS. ARE VICTIMS WHO WERE CAUGHT- URGED TO DO ACTIVITIES THAT LED TO AN OFFENSE IN THE RECORDS. THERE'S A LOT MORE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE THERE BUT A MINIMUM TO HAS BEEN ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THERE HAS TO BE A WAY TO BY KATE THOSE RECORDS. ALSO THERE HAS BEEN SOME EFFORTS TO ENSURE THAT. WE GO AND TRYING TO PREVENT HUMAN TRAFFICKING AT EARLY AGE- BY. AT FORMER HUSBAND MEMBER BONTA OUT YOU NEED TO PASS A BILL THAT UP A- VERGE PROFESSIONALS IN K. TO TWELVE TO BE TRAINED AND THEN PROVIDE AWARENESS TO MINORS ABOUT HUMAN TRAFFICKING. THIS POINT IS IMPORTANT AS ALL NINE RECRUITMENT BY HUMAN TRAFFICKING HAS INCREASED BY ABOUT 22% IN THE LAST YEAR'S. LASTLY THE LEGISLATURE HAS ALSO MADE PROGRESS TO ENSURE THE LABOR TRAFFICKING HE'S ALSO PRIORITIZE. DO THAT AND HE PROVIDED THE AUTHORITY TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING TO INVESTIGATE A COMEBACK LABOR TRAFFICKING. HOWEVER THESE POLICIES HOW FALLING SHORT MOSTLY BECAUSE OF LACK OF FUNDING AND PRIORITIZATION BY THE LEGISLATURE. AB IT IS FOUR DOT THAT REASON THAT WE ARE REQUESTING A FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR BUDGET ALLOCATION- AND ALSO SEEKING LEGISLATIVE CHANGES IN THE AREAS OF LABOR- LAW BUT THEN ALSO TO PROVIDE RELIEF FOR VICTIMS WITH SOME OFFENSES. I PROPOSAL WHICH YOU KNOW YOU HAVE IN YOUR PACKAGE IS A ONE TIME ALLOCATION OF FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS THAT ARE FOR RESEARCH WITH HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING EDUCATION AND PREVENTION. THESE ONE TIME A LOCATION FUNDING WILL FUND THE FOLLOWING ONE THE PREVALENCE STUDY TO UNDERSTAND THE EXTENT LOCATION AND DEMOGRAPHICS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING IN CALIFORNIA. TO PROVIDE TRAINING AND TECHNICAL RESOURCES TO SERVICE OUR SERVICE PROVIDERS. THREE MAKE SURE THAT THE ANKLE THE CURRENT LAW- THAT IS IN PLACE I HAS FUNDING IN DAYS MEANS THAT PROVIDE I'M GOING CURRICULA FOCUS A FUNDING TO COMBAT COMMAND TRAFFICKING IN K. TO TWELVE- FOR- MAKE SURE THAT WE FIND AN AVERAGE PROGRAM. WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING WHICH HAS THE AUTHORITY TO COME BACK LABOR TRAFFICKING AND YET THEY'RE LACKING FUNDING TO IMPLEMENT THAT LAW SINCE TWO THOUSAND SIX SIXTY. LAST ALSO DEDICATED AND IT AND FIND A TASK FORCE WITHIN AT THE I. R. DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIALRELATIONS ARE TO FIGHT OUT- AN INVESTIGATIVE OR TRAFFIC IN. AB FOR THE PAST THREE YEARS AND YOU WILL HAVE A SPEAKER DON'T SPEAK ON THE REPORTS FROM THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION AND AT THE THIS COMMISSION HAS ISSUED THREE REPORTS AND HAS DONE THIS EXTENSIVE RESEARCH IN REGARDS TO HUMAN TRAFFICKING THE PATTERN THAT COMES OUT OF THOSE REPORTS IS THAT THE STATE HAS TO DO MORE WORK AS RELATES TO LABOR TRAFFICKING IT IS FOR THAT REASON THAT WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR US ADULT ARAMBULA COOL BE AT INTRODUCED AND I THREE AT A BILL THAT WE CALLED AND THE LABOR TRAFFICKING ACT OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. WHICH I WOULD ALLOW ME PROVIDE AT THIRTY TO DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS TO INVESTIGATE A COME BACK LABOR TRAFFICKING THE SAME WAY THAT APARTMENT A FRIEND HOUSING HAS THAT AUTHORITY AS WELL- THE OTHER. BILL THAT ALSO TRYING IT AT. WILL BE. IT IS FOR. TO ENSURE THAT VICTIMS WHO ARE- YOU ARE A VICTIM OF TRAFFICKING WHO ARE MY- HAVE ALL AND ARE VICTIMS OF THE ATTACK. HAVE ALSO ACCESS TO THE RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO THEM AND TO THAT END WE ARE INTRODUCING A BILL- AND ASSEMBLY THAT MAJORITY LEADER- RADIUS WILL BE OUT THERE IN THAT BILL- THIS BILL SEEKS TO ENSURE. THAT ND CLARIFY THE CURRENT STATUTE- RELATED TO- CHILD ABUSE I ALSO INCLUDES LABOR TRAFFICKING AB SO THAT BOTH SIX AND LABOR TRAFFIC YOU TO RECEIVE THE SAME SUPPORT AND PROTECTION IS THAT THEY ARE CURRENTLY ARE ABLE OR HAVE UNDER CURRENT STATUTES YET LABOR TRAFFICKING OF MINORS AT TIMES ARE NOT IDENTIFIED- TO THE PROFESSIONALS BECAUSE THERE IS A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF THAT. OF THAT POPULATION. I'M LASTLY WILL SAY THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS PROVIDED RELIEF TO VICTIMS THAT WERE CARS AGAIN TO PARTICIPATE IN CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES AFFECT IN THEIR RECORDS AND HAPPENED ABILITY TO BECOME SELF SUFFICIENT- WE APPRECIATE AS A MEMBER GIVE STUFF WILL BE OUT THERE IN THE BILL. THE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CLARIFY THAT THAT'S THAT YOU ALSO. APPLIES TO NOT CITIZENS THERE IS A VAGUE LANGUAGE RIGHT NOW AND WE HOPE THAT THAT BILL ALSO MAKE IT TO THE TO THE PROCESS. AGAIN WE THANK THIS COMMITTEE FOR SEEKING THE INPUT ON THE FACT THAT INDIVIDUALS BUT THEN ALSO EXPERTS FROM ACROSS THE SECTOR TO MAKE SURE THAT WE TACKLE HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND A COMPREHENSIVE. AN INTERSECTIONAL APPROACH THANK YOU. THANK YOU NOT RICH. I AM PROFESSOR STEPHANIE RICHARD WITH LAW SCHOOL AND THE DRINK DIRECTOR OF THE AND FORCED PRO.

TRAPPERS WE ARE GOVERNMENT SYSTEM REGULATORY IS REAGANESQUE BUSINESS ON OUR LACK OF ATTENTION VULNERABLE YOUR ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE ARE CALIFORNIA MUST BE CREATIVE IN ITS TO COMBATING TRAFFICKING IN AND I CAN ONLY BE BY BY FREE X. NEW ON POLICY. FIFTY FOUR. THIS THANK YOU FOR DEEP THE TIME TO DISCUSS WITH THEM ISSUE RIGHT NOW ALL. THANK YOU IN OUR LAST ANALYST A- SIMPLY RESEARCH. YEAH GOOD MORNING EVERY- MY A THANK. MORE THAT ARE AND I HAVE A MEMBER OF THE OVER THAT'S WHAT AS THE CHAIR OF THE COMMISSION ARE. OF THE CONSIDERED BE A ONE TO SAY ME ON THE OUTSIDE PROGRAM WE ARE ALL TWENTY WHICH THE TO PROVIDE THIS. WHAT IS THE LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE HOOVER COMMISSION THE COMMISSION IS AN IN BY PART OVERSIGHT AGENCY CHARGED WITH MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE GOVERNOR AND LEGISLATURETHE IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS. OF STATE GOVERNMENT. IN TWENTY NINETEEN WE LAW THIS ON THE STREET FIRST FORM OF MARTINSVILLE. EXPLOITS WEAKNESSES WORKERS WILL FORCE. TRAPPED IN OPPRESSIVE SITUATIONS WE WERE HONORED DURING IN TWENTY NINETEEN THAT SENATE PRESIDENT PRO TEM TONI ATKINS OPENED OUR FIRST HEARING ON THIS TOPIC IN SAN DIEGO. I BELIEVE THAT YOU ALSO HAVE A COPY OF THE SLIDES AND I WAS SUPPOSED TO USE WHEN I WAS HAVING TECH ISSUES SO IF YOU COULD JUST REFER TO IT YOU WILL HELP OUR FINAL. TESTIMONY I AM GIVING. SO THE REPORT THAT WE ISSUED OUR OR OR WE DID CONTAMINATED IN OUR THREE ARE UP TO REPORTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE GOVERNOR AND LEGISLATURE THE STRENGTHENED CALIFORNIA'S RESPONSE. THESE FINEST HEROES CRIME. TODAY I WILL SHARE WITH YOU FINDINGS FROM THESE REPORTS AND THE STEPS CALIFORNIA CAN TAKE TO BETTER ADDRESS. LABOR TRAFFICKING. SO WHAT WHAT LABOR TRAFFICKING. IN CALIFORNIA LOOK LIKE. THE STATE MADE OLD OF TRAFFICKING A CRIME BACK IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE. THINGS THEN STATE POLICIES FUNDING AND RESOURCES HAVE LARGELY FOCUSED ON COMBATING SEX TRAFFICKING PARTICULARLY OF MINORS LET ME BE CLEAR THE WORK AGAINST SEX TRAFFICKING MUST CONTINUE- WE ALSO MUST DO MORE TO COMBAT LABOR TRAFFICKING NORTH STATE. AND ALTHOUGH THERE IS SO MUCH THAT WE DO NOT KNOW DATA FROM NATIONAL HEADLINES AND STATE PROGRAMS GIVE US A LOT OF INSIGHTS INTO WHERE LABOR TRAFFICKING IS OCCURRING IN CALIFORNIA AND WHO IS IMPACTED. SO WHERE DOES LABOR TRAFFICKING HAVE BEEN IN OUR STATE. CALIFORNIA'S MAJOR HARBOURS AIRPORTS COASTLINES AND APPROXIMATELY THREE INTERNATIONAL BORDERS MAKE OUR STATE ALL ARTICULATED WEARABLES HUMAN TRAFFICKING. LABOR TRAFFICKING OF COURSE IN A VAST RANGE OF INDUSTRIES INCLUDING DOMESTIC WORK TRAVELING SALES AND WE CULTURE RESTAURANTS BEAUTY AND CONSTRUCTION. SURVIVORS OF HIS ABUSE SHOW UP MORE FREQUENTLY IN LOS ANGELES AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY MORE THAN OTHER CONDITIONS IN CALIFORNIA. WHEN I TALK ABOUT THIS POPULATION WHO ARE WE TALKING ABOUT. NATIONAL DATA SUGGEST THAT THERE IS NOT A SINGLE TYPE OF PERSON WHO FOR. WAS BRAVE A NEIGHBOR TO MAKING. MORE WORK BETTER AT PRIME WORKING AGE ARE EIGHTEEN AND FORTY YEARS OLD MANY IMMIGRANTS WHO ARE IN ENTERED THE COUNTRY BELIEVE TO PERFORM SOME KIND OF TEMPORARY WORK AND BECOME A AUTHORIZED USER THEIR TRAFFICKING. STATE DATA ALSO BUILT THE LABOR TRAFFICKING SURVIVORS ACCOUNT FOR ABOUT TWENTY FEET OF THE MORE THAN FOURTEEN THOUSAND UMAN TRAFFICKING SURVIVORS RECEIVE STATE ASSISTANCE FROM TWENTY SIXTEEN TO TWENTY NINETEEN. THIS INCLUDES MEN AND WOMEN AND CHILDREN AND ADULTS INDIVIDUALS FROM A VARIETY OF ETHNIC BACKGROUNDS ENGLISH AND NON ENGLISH SPEAKERS AS WELL AS INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES. SO WHAT ARE SOME OF THE PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS THAT ARE THE COMMISSION'S REPORT HIGHLIGHTED CALIFORNIA TAKE ACTION TO COMBAT LABOR TRAFFICKING JUST AS AGGRESSIVELY AS IT COMBATS SEX TRAFFICKING. THERE'S A NEXUS BETWEEN THE TWO. HOWEVER THERE ARE SEVERAL BARRIERS THAT PREVENT CALIFORNIA FROM DOING SO AND LET ME OUTLINED SOME OF THOSE KEY CHALLENGES THAT WE IDENTIFIED AS WELL AS THE SOLUTIONS YOU RECOMMEND. PROBLEM NUMBER ONE CALIFORNIA LACKS LEADERSHIP AROUND ANTI TRAFFICKING ACTIVITIES. FIRST WE FOUND THE CALIFORNIA LACKS A COORDINATED STRATEGY TO TARGET NEWMAN TRAFFICKING STATEWIDE LET ALONE TO PURSUE LABOR TRAFFICKING SPECIFICALLY. ORDINATING BODY LEAVITT LED BY THE STATE DEPARTMENT THE STATE'S DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES COMBATS CHILD SEX TRAFFICKING BUT NO OTHER RECORDED NIGHT COORDINATING BODY EXISTS AT THE STATE LEVEL. TWO STATE AGENCIES THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING AS WELL AS THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAVE A ROLE IN PROSECUTING HUMAN TRAFFICKING FOR BOTH CIVIL AND CRIMINAL OFFENSES. LOOKING TO OTHER STATES WE FOUND THAT LAKE COUNTY FOR NOW MOST FOCUSED ON SEX TRAFFICKING PARTICULARLY EXCEPT FOR THE STATE OF COLORADO LET'S NOT MORTALS A STATEWIDE MODEL THE CALIFORNIA CUT COULD ACTUALLY LOOK TO OR OR OR ARE EXAMINED. ALSO RECOMMENDATIONS ACCORDED CALIFORNIA STATE RESPONDS. PROVIDES THE LEADERSHIP ARE ON TRAFFICKING WE RECOMMEND TO PROVIDE STATE LEADERSHIP BROWN TRAFFICKING WE RECOMMEND THAT CALIFORNIA FORM AND I'M THANK YOU MUCH TRAFFICKING COUNCIL TO COORDINATE EFFORTS OF GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND NGOS ARE ON FIGHTING ALL FORMS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING. FOR THREE PATIENTS SHOULD BE BROADBAND AND INCLUDE REPRESENTATIVES OF LAW ENFORCEMENT HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICE AGENCIES ADVOCATES SURVIVORS AND OTHERS. THE GOAL DISCUSS WE SHOULD BE TO RAISE PUBLIC AWARENESS ABOUT TRAFFICKING COLLECTING DATA ABOUT WHERE AND HOW TRAFFICKING OCCURS IN THE STATE. IMPROVE TRAINING. DEVELOP STANDARDIZED WHICH TRAFFICKING AND CATALOG AND ASSESS RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE FOR SURVIVORS SO THAT THEY ARE EASILY ACCESSIBLE. PROBLEM NUMBER TWO LABOR TRAFFICKING OFTEN GOES UNDETECTED. WE FOUND THAT LABOR TRAFFICKING IS OFTEN HARD TO IDENTIFY AND THUS FREQUENTLY GOES UNDETECTED IT CAN BE HIDDEN IN PLAIN SIGHT YOU'VE HEARD OF SOME OF THE TESTIMONY EARLIER OFTEN WITHIN BUSINESSES OR INDUSTRIES THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE BE LEGITIMATE BECAUSE THIS OCCURS IN ALMOST MANY OF THE INDUSTRIES THAT I HAVE NOTED BOB OBSTACLES TO FINDING LABOR TRAFFICKING IN CALIFORNIA. OUR RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS SEVERAL OBSTACLES THAT MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO IDENTIFY LABOR TRAFFICKING CASES. A VARIETY OF GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS COULD ENCOUNTER LABOR TRAFFICKING IN THE COURSE OF THEIR DAY TO DAY WORK BURKE BUT NO STATE AGENCY HAS A MANDATE TO ACTUALLY LOOK FOR LABOR TRAFFICKING. TO LOOK FOR SPECIFIC INDICATORS OF TRAFFICKING. INVESTIGATORS OFTEN STUMBLE ACROSS THE EVIDENCE BUT THEY ARE NOT PROACTIVE IN LOOKING FOR IT. MOST GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY TO IDENTIFY LABOR TRAFFICKING OR HOW TO REPORT ANY FINDINGS. PURSUING THESE CASES REQUIRES COORDINATION AMONG AGENCIES INVOLVED LABOR RIGHTS LAW ENFORCEMENT AND MANY OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES WHAT OFTENTIMES WORK IS DONE IN CYCLES OFTEN WITH DISCONNECT BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND YOU ARE OFFICIALS AS WELL AS OTHER STAKEHOLDERS. THE ONLY THE DEPARTMENT YOUTH THE REPORT ABUSES OFTEN FALLS AND WILL NOTABLE WORKERS WHO ARE LEGITIMATELY FEARFUL TO REPORT ABUSES AND AS A RESULT CASES GO UNREPORTED. WHAT ARE SOME OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS TO UNCOVER THIS HIDDEN CRIME. WE RECOMMEND SEVERAL STEPS FOR THE STATE TO INCREASE ITS FIRST ONE COVER LABOR TRAFFICKING. CALIFORNIA SHOULD TRAIN STATE INVESTIGATORS AND OTHER EMPLOYERS WHO INTERACT WITH HIGH RISK POPULATIONS TO RECOGNIZE THE WARNING SIGNS OF LABOR TRAFFICKING AND RESPOND APPROPRIATELY. WE MUST RAPIDLY USE DATA AND TECHNOLOGY TO SEARCH FOR ANOMALIES THAT MIGHT SUGGEST THE PRESENCE OF LABOR TRAFFICKING IN CERTAIN BUSINESSES INDUSTRIES OR REGIONS. WE SHOULD INCREASE AWARENESS OF ALL FORMS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING THROUGH PUBLIC AWARENESS AND OUTREACH CAMPAIGNS VARIOUS BARRIERS THAT MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR SURVIVORS THE AXIS HELP. WHEN I HAD A NUMBER OF CHALLENGES THAT MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR SUCH SURVIVORS TO GET THE HELP THAT THEY NEED. WHAT ARE SOME OF THOSE. SURVIVORS NEED A RANGE OF SUPPORTS BUT WE DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT THE SPECIFIC NEEDS OF LABOR TRAFFICKING SURVIVORS TO SAY WHICH PROGRAMS ARE MOST EFFECTIVE AND HOW THEIR BEST DELIVERED. ADDITIONALLY SURVIVORS QUALIFY FOR VARIOUS PROGRAMS AND SERVICES BUT HELP ISN'T ALWAYS EASY TO FIND THERE IS NO ONE STOP SHOP TO FIND INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT IS AVAILABLE STATEWIDE. FOR THIS WE'D LIKE TO RECOMMEND THE FOLLOWING. TRACKS SERVICE PROVISION TO LABOR TRAFFICKING SURVIVORS SO WE CAN. BETTER UNDERSTAND THE NEEDS AND DEMOGRAPHICS OF THIS POPULATION ADVOCACY OF SERVICE PROGRAMS AND CREATE A USER FRIENDLY DIRECTORY OF ALL RESOURCES FOR TRAFFICKING SURVIVORS TO MAKE IT EASIER TO FIND HELP. LASTLY WE FOUND THE PROSECUTION'S FOR LABOR TRAFFICKING ARE RARE WE KNOW THAT AT THE VERY LEAST HUNDREDS OF LABOR TRAFFICKING SURVIVORS SEEK HELP OUR NEWLY IN CALIFORNIA BUT ON AVERAGE THERE ARE LESS THAN THIRTY CONVICTIONS FOR LABOR TRAFFICKING EACH YEAR. IN THE STATE. SO WISELY WE'RE TALKING DIFFICULT TO PROSECUTE YOU ASK LABOR TRAFFICKING IS DIFFICULT TO PROSECUTE FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS. WHY ANY SURVIVORS MAY BE RELUCTANT TO PARTICIPATE AND PROSECUTIONS FOR FEAR ALL BROUGH TRAUMATIZING ATION. FOR YOUR OUR OUR DISTRUST OF LAW ENFORCEMENT OR JUST SIMPLY WANTING TO MOVE ON FROM THE REVIEWS. THE INVESTIGATIONS ARE ESPECIALLY COSTLY TIME CONSUMING AND RESOURCE INTENSIVE. WE CAN REQUIRE INVOLVEMENT OF SPECIALIZED INVESTIGATORS. AS WELL AS RESEARCHING NEW ERA AREAS OF LAW WHEN THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF PHYSICAL FORCE OR VIOLENCE MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO PROVE IN COURT. WE DON'T USE SEVEN ENFORCEMENT ENOUGH IN EITHER LOCAL OR STATE COURTS AT THE STATE LEVEL THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING WAS AUTHORIZED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN TO PROSECUTE SIMPLE HUMAN TRAFFICKING COMPLAINTS BUT THERE HAVE BEEN NO PROSECUTIONS TO DATE. LOS ANGELES CITY ATTORNEY AND OTHERS JURISDICTIONS ARE EXPERIMENTING WITH USING CIVIL ACTION TO GO AFTER TRAFFICKERS. THIS IS VERY NOBODY WORK BUT AT THE STATE WE DON'T TRACK WITH AND WE HAVEN'T EXPLORED THIS WIDELY ENOUGH. THE STATE ALSO LACKS RESOURCES LIKE PUBLISHED CASE LAW AND TRAINING FOR PROSECUTION PROSECUTORS THE STATE LAWS TO PURSUE LABOR TRAFFICKING CASES. WHILE THERE ARE RESOURCES FOR HOW TO USE STATE LAWS TO GO AFTER SEX TRAFFICKING CASES THERE IS NO CLARITY IN RESOURCES FOR LABOR TRAFFICKING CASES. WE DON'T HAVE FORMAL AGREEMENTS OR OTHER INFORMATION SHARING AGREEMENTS IN PLACE FOSTER ONGOING COORDINATION AMONG RELEVANT AGENCIES. FINALLY WHAT ARE SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS TO BRING TRAFFICKERS TO JUSTICE. WHAT IS EMPOWERING THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS THE NEED EFFORTS TO PURSUE LABOR TRAFFICKING CASES ALONGSIDE OTHER WORK TO COMBAT THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY. CREATING STANDARDIZED MEANS FOR AGENCIES TO TRACK REFERRALS OR COMPLAINTS SHARE INFORMATION AND PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO CASES. WE CAN TRACK HOW MANY AND WHAT TYPES OF LABOR TRAFFICKING CASES ARE BROUGHT FORWARD AND STUDY OUTCOMES OF THESE CASES THE IDENTIFY BEST PRACTICES. WE CAN ALSO ENHANCE TRAINING SO LAW ENFORCEMENT AND COURT PERSONNEL KNOW HOW TO USE STATE LAWS TO COMBAT LABOR TRAFFICKING. THESE RECOMMENDATIONS ONCE IMPLEMENTED WILL HELP ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA TAKE STRONGER ACTIONS TO DETECT LABOR TRAFFICKING. HELP SURVIVORS AND PROSECUTE PERPETRATORS THE COMMISSION WOULD BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE YOU WITH A DETAILED- THREE REPORTS THAT WE DID A FEW YEARS AGO IF IT'LL HELP GIVE MORE DETAIL ON THE TESTIMONY THAT I PROVIDED. THANK YOU ARE MEDICARE COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND I AM HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU COMMISSIONER- LOUISA. DR CORK I'VE BEEN TOLD YOU HAVE PERFECT WAY TO THE CHECK CAME BACK HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE CHAIR SO SHE COULD GO TO ANOTHER MEMBER. OKAY THANK YOU. IS THERE SOMEONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO YES GO AHEAD SIR. FIRST AND FOREMOST I WANT TO THANK ALL OF THE PANELISTS TODAY WE HAVE COME AND SHARE YOUR- YOUR EXPERTISE THE SENATE GENENTECH TRAFFICKING POLICY INITIATIVE THAT. WILL LAW SCHOOL AS AN EXAMPLE FOR THE ENTIRE STATE IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY ON HOW TO LOOK AT ALL OF THESE ISSUES IN A IN A HOLISTIC SENSE. I MISS GRIFFITH IN PARTICULAR THANK YOU FOR COMING IN PERSON. I AM TESTIFYING SO POWERFULLY IN REMINDING US THAT. ADDRESSING THE HARM CAUSED BY EXPLOITATION WITH SYSTEMS THAT ARE ROOTED IN HARM AND EXPLOITATION MIGHT ALSO BE COUNTER TO THE BROADER GOALS. A WELLBEING DETERRENCE. AND ACCOUNTABILITY- YOU ALSO POINT OUT A NUMBER OF WAYS THAT THE STATE HAS PERSONALLY FAILED YOU AND I APOLOGIZE. FOR THOSE BETWEEN YOUR TESTIMONY AND THE TESTIMONY FROM THE VICTIMS COMPENSATION FUND I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF WORK. THAT WE CAN DO I'M SHOCKED I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE REST THE COMMITTEE TO HEAR THAT ONLY FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY APPLICANTS. HAVE APPLIED TO THE VICTIMS COMPENSATION FUND- AND THAT THERE'S THIS MISMATCH BETWEEN TRAFFICKING AND OTHER DEFINITIONS AND POLICE REPORT I THINK IT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO LOOK AT HIM PROBABLY LOOK AT URGENTLY- AND SO MY- QUESTION IS LESS OF A QUESTION. AND MORE OF A COMMENT OF GRATITUDE AND THANK YOU FOR ALL OF THE INSIGHT THAT YOU ALL HERE TODAY. THE NO BELIEVE MR. QUESTION WAS FOR ME. YES MISTER CHAIR SO WE HEARD OUTSTANDING- TESTIMONY BOTH FROM THE GENTLEMAN HERE AND FROM THIS BOOZER AND OTHERS ON LABOR TRAFFICKING. AS I SAID IT'S 80% ROUGHLY NOBODY REALLY KNOWS AN EXACT NUMBER BUT IT'S 80% OF THE PROBLEM. NOT THE MOST AMUSING DE UNIONIZING PART BUT CERTAINLY A VERY LARGE PART. AND MY QUESTION FOR YOU AND COMMITTEE STAFF IS OF THE VARIOUS RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WERE GETTING. WHICH OF THEM ARE BUDGET AT WHICH OF THEM ARE WOULD BE BEST SOLVED BY A BUDGET ASK. WHICH WOULD BE BEST SOLVED BY LEGISLATION. WHICH WOULD BE BEST SOLVED BY THE ADMINISTRATION TAKING A DIFFERENT APPROACH. ALL ON THE ADMINISTRATION SIDE- WE COULD CERTAINLY PASS A RESOLUTION ASKING THEM TO DO SOMETHING OF COURSE LEGISLATION I WOULD BE GLAD CO AUTHOR AUTHOR. AND PERHAPS WE AS A GROUP COULD GET TOGETHER WITH BUDGET SUB FIVE THE GROUP THAT WORKS WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT ALTHOUGH. IT'S THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS PERHAPS. BEST TO GET AWAY FROM BUDGET SUB FIVE AND WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS. ON THIS LABOR TRAFFICKING ISSUE WHICH IS A MUCH HARDER PROBLEM. AND MUCH WERE WE HAVEN'T PUT THE RESOURCES IN BOTH WHICH IS CAUSING SO MUCH PAIN. SO THAT IS MY QUESTION TO YOU MISTER CHAIR AND TO YOUR STAFF. AND PERHAPS IF YOU COULD GET BACK TO- IF YOU'RE WILLING TO GET BACK TO OUR COMMITTEE MEMBERS. AND TALK ABOUT NEXT STEPS I THINK IT'S SOMETHING WE'RE ALL OF US. ARE COULD GET TOGETHER AND PROVIDE A CAT PATH FORWARD BECAUSE OF THE GREAT. VALUE THAT WE'VE HEARD TODAY YES- IN A IN A REASON WE HAVE THESE HEARINGS IS SO THAT WE CAN LEARN MORE A GUY THE FOR ME- I DIDN'T KNOW HOW SERIOUS THE PROBLEM OF LABOR. TRAFFICKING WHAT. IS RIGHT NOW AND SO- OBVIOUSLY WE NEED TO WE'VE SEEN SOME BILLS I THINK SOME FROM LORETTA GONZALEZ WHO WAS A FORMER COLLEAGUE OF OURS. PACIFIC WE NEED TO STEP UP. WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IN THE PAST. I THINK WE ALSO NEED TO DO ON ALL THREE LEVELS IN A STRAIGHT OF. LEGISLATION AND BUDGET- ONE WORKING WITH ADMINISTRATION SO THEY CAN TIGHTEN UP THE EFFICIENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE- THE OPERATING ORGANIZATION THAT'S IN PLACE RIGHT NOW. SO WE CAN DO A BETTER JOB WHILE WORKING WITH INDIVIDUALS. AND I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE YESTERDAY WAS BUDGET SUB FIVE. AND WE TALKED ABOUT THE VICTIMS COMPENSATION BOARD. AND I MENTIONED- ABOUT VICTIMS PEOPLE WHO ARE VICTIMS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND WHETHER OR NOT- LIKE THE END INDIVIDUAL THAT WAS ON A NO KNOCK WARRANT THAT WAS KILLED BY POLICE EVEN THOUGH HE WENT TO THE PERSON THEY WERE LOOKING FOR HE DIED AS A RESULT OF. WELL ACCORDING TO THE- HE WOULD NOT BE. HE OR HIS FAMILY WOULD NOT BE. ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE VICTIMS COMPENSATION BECAUSE THEY WOULDN'T CATEGORIZE THAT AS THE CRIME. WE MAY THINK OR I MAY THINK IT WAS A CRIME THAT THAT HAPPENED BUT SINCE IT'S NOT A CRIME IN SOME WAYS IT'S A CASUALTY OF WAR CAVITY THAT HAPPEN IS A MISTAKE SAID UNFORTUNATE ACCIDENT AND ALL OF THAT. BUT THAT FAMILY COULDN'T GET FUNERAL EXPENSES PAID THEY COULD GET A MENTAL HEALTH BECAUSE IT IS NOT CTEGORIZED AS A CRIME AND SO WE PROBABLY NEED TO LOOK AT LEGISLATION SO THAT THE VICTIMS COMPENSATION BOARD CAN ADDRESS. OF SOME OF THE THINGS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT MAYBE FILL THOSE LOOPHOLES AND THAT WAS IN BUDGET YESTERDAY LITERALLY YESTERDAY WE HAD THAT DISCUSSION. AND SO YOU'RE RIGHT WE NEED TO BRING THEM BRING DEMAND SO IT IS A IT IS A- THREE PRONG. EFFORT AND WE NEED IT THE OTHER THING WE'VE GOT TO STOP WORKING IN SILOS AND START TALKING TO EACH OTHER. ON THE SAME WAY WITH- MATURING THAT. DOJ AND OTHERS WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS THAT- IT'S NOT JUST LAW ENFORCEMENT IS NOT JUST. REHABILITATION AND GETTING TO THE ROOT CAUSES OF TRAUMA AND EVERYTHING IS NOT JUST THAT IT'S NOT JUST MAKING SURE THE INFRASTRUCTURE WE CREATE- WILL ADDRESS EVERYTHING SO- I. I WOULD HAVE THAT'S PART OF WHY WE PUT THIS TOGETHER. SO WE COULD GET DIRECTION OR AT LEAST HAVE AN IDEA OF HOW WE CAN SOLVE THIS AT THE END OF THE DAY I'M TIRED OF TALKING ABOUT THE PROBLEM. A LONG TALK ABOUT SOLUTIONS AND FINALLY WORK ON THINGS. THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY DO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. RESPOND TO. AT FIRST I ALSO WANTED TO THANK MRS GRIFFITH FOR YOUR INCREDIBLY POWERFUL TESTIMONY AT A PARTICULARLY IN TWO ASPECTS OF IT ONE AT YOUR DESCRIPTION OF THE WAY IN WHICH OUR PERSONAL SYSTEM CONTINUES TO RE HARMON NOT REALLY CREATE THE KIND OF REHABILITATIVE OPPORTUNITIES THAT PEOPLE NEED I THINK THAT YOUR PARTICULAR- DESCRIPTION OF THE WAY IN WHICH YOU AS SOMEBODY WHO IS HAS BEEN A VICTIM OF ASSAULT. ALSO HAD TO BE SUBJECTED TO A SYSTEM THAT CONTINUE TO ASSAULT YOU- AND- ONE THING THAT THAT RACE FOR ME WAS THAT AMOUNT OR QUITE FRANKLY THE LACK OF RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE NCDC ARE GOING SPECIFICALLY TOWARDS REHABILITATIVE CARE AND TRAUMA INFORMED CARE AND AT MISTER CHAIR I WOULD LOVE FOR US TO BE ABLE TO TAKE UP AN OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY LOOK AT THE DISTRIBUTION OF DOLLARS THAT GO TOWARDS IT I WAS TOLD BY ONE GROUP THAT WE ONLY HAVE ABOUT ONE PERCENT. OF THE DOLLARS IN CDC ARE GOING TOWARDS REHABILITATION REHABILITATE CAROUSEL THAT'S SOMETHING I THINK THAT WE NEED TO LOOK INTO- WHEN WOULD SUPPORT YOU IN IN DOING THAT- AND THE SECOND ISSUE IS THAT I WANTED TO JUST REYES WAS AT THANK YOU TO MR VIJAY REZA- FOR- MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY AYE HE DID MAKE A SPECIFIC BUDGET ASK A FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR US TO BE ABLE TO EXPAND THE SCOPE OF OUR KNOWLEDGE PARTICULAR TO. LABOR TRAFFICKING AND- AND IT DOES SEEM TO BE AN AREA AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER CORE GRAZED AT THAT WE CONTINUE TO NOT HAVE ENOUGH VISIBILITY INTO IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO SHAPE THE KINDS OF SOLUTIONS THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS SO I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN BOTH.
