AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH CENTER WAS A FOR THE INVITATION TO SPEAK BEFORE THE COMMITTEE TODAY AND I LIKE TO COUNT THANK THEM MEXICAN CONSUL GENERAL AS WELL -- IT'S IT'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK TO ALL OF YOU MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- I THINK IT'S PRETTY EVERYONE'S HERE'S PRETTY AWARE THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IT SHOWED PRO TO TO THE BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP. HAS BEEN AFOLK PROCHE FOCUSED ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY ON IMMIGRATION AND TRADE. A FOCUS THE BLAMES MEXICO FOR THESE PROBLEMS DESPITE THERE BEING REGIONAL IN NATURE. AND A FOCUS IT DOESN'T SEEK TO CREATE CREATE OF CROSS BORDER COLLABORATION TO DEAL WITH OUR SHARED PROBLEMS AND ARE COMMON -- OPPORTUNITIES -- BUT WITH LESS WELL KNOWN AS THE MEXICAN APPROACH TO THE BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP AND THE WAY IN WHICH IT ACTUALLY COMPLIMENTS THE WHITE HOUSE IS LACK OF INTEREST. IN BILATERAL GATE ENGAGEMENT TO SOLVE OUR SHARED PROBLEMS R TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OUR SHARED OPPORTUNITIES. FOR MEXICO'S PRESIDENT ANDRES MANUEL LOPEZ OBRADOR AN AMATEUR HISTORIAN. THE HISTORY OF MEXICO AND ITS RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES AS IT'S TAUGHT IN MEXICO IS IN THE FOREFRONT OF HIS THINKING ABOUT THE BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP. SO WHAT IS IT THAT AND LOW IN MOST MEXICANS THINK ABOUT WHEN THEY THINK ABOUT HISTORY. I THINK THAT THE UNITED STATES TOOK HALF OF MEXICO'S TERRITORY IN EIGHTEEN FORTY EIGHT AFTER A BRIEF. FOR THEY THINK THAT IN THE EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY THE UNITED STATES CONSTANTLY INTERVENED IN MEXICAN INTERNAL AFFAIRS. TO INFLUENCE THE COURSE OF THE MEXICAN REVOLUTION AND TO PRESSURE MEXICO TO IMPLEMENT ITS POST REVOLUTIONARY CONSTITUTION. IN A MANNER THAT MAX SURPRISED US NOT MEXICAN INTERESTS. MEXICAN FOREIGN POLICY FOR MOST OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY WAS THUS GEARED TOWARD KEEPING UNITED STATES AT ARMS LENGTH. AND TO PREVENT IS THERE FOR FROM INTERVENING IN MEXICAN INTERNAL AFFAIRS. THAT'S WHY THIS PAST QUARTER OF A CENTURY OF U. S. MEXICO RELATIONS A PERIOD OF CLOSE BY NATIONAL COLLABORATION TO DEAL WITH COMMON PROBLEMS AND ADVANCE SHARED OPPORTUNITIES HAS BEEN SO STRIKING. MEXICAN FOREIGN POLICY UNDER THE LOPEZ OBRADOR ADMINISTRATION HOWEVER IS A BIT OF A THROWBACK. IT HAS MANY OF THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PRE NINETEEN NINETIES MEXCAN FOREIGN POLICY OF KEEPING UNITED STATES AT ARMS DISTANCE. LOPEZ OBRADOR FIRMLY BELIEVES IN THE IMPORTANCE OF BUILDING MEXICAN NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY AND A TIME TO ME. AND HE IS CONSTANTLY COGNIZANT OF THE POWER DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND MEXICO. AND THIS THIS STRONGLY INFORMS HIS CONCEPTION OF WHAT A COMPROMISE IS A GOOD FOREIGN POLICY. LOCUSTS OVER THERE BELIEVES THE BEST FOREIGN POLICY IS A STRONG DOMESTIC POLICY. MEXICO SHOULD NOT WASTE OF TIME AND RESOURCES MEDDLING IN WORLD AFFAIRS BUT SHOULD INSTEAD FOCUS ITS EFFORTS ON STRENGTHENING ITSELF POLITICALLY AND ESPECIALLY ECONOMICALLY. HE ALSO BELIEVES THAT THE POWER DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES MEANS THAT MEXICO SHOULD NEVER GIVE UNITED STATES AN EXCUSE TO INTERFERE IN MEXICAN AFFAIRS. FOR OUR PURPOSES THAT TODAY THIS HAS ONE MAIN IMPLICATION FOR MEXICAN FOREIGN POLICY. THE LOCALS OVER LOWER GOVERNMENT HAS NOT AND WILL NOT RESPOND TO PRESIDENT TRUMP'S PROVOCATIONS. AFTER EACH HAS TO A HOSTILE ACT A RHETORICAL OUTBURSTS LOPEZ OBRADOR'S POSITION HAS BEEN CONSISTENT. IT IS THE U. S. SOVEREIGN RIGHT TO SET ITS OWN IMMIGRATION POLICY AND TO BUILD A WALL IF IT WANTS TO MEXICO WILL NOT COMMENT. AT THE SAME TIME MEXICO DOES NOT WANT ANY PROBLEMS WITH UNITED STATES. PROBLEMS THAT MIGHT LEAD TO A CENTER INTERFERENCE IN MEXICAN INTERNAL AFFAIRS OR MIGHT OTHERWISE DISTRACT LOPEZ OBRADOR FROM HIS DOMESTIC AGENDA. NOR IS THIS POLICY OF NOT COMMENTING ON PRESIDENT TRUMP'S IMMIGRATION POLICIES A PROPOSED WALL AFTER CHANGE IN THE NEAR FUTURE FOR AT LEAST THREE REASONS. FIRST THE NEW US MCA THE US MEXICO CANADA TRADE AGREEMENT. BEYOND THE VISIBLE OR NOT WANTING PROBLEMS WITH THE UNITED STATES IN GENERAL HE UNDERSTANDS THE MEXICAN ECONOMY. IS RELIANT ON FREE TRADE WITH THE UNITED STATES HE JUST NEEDS THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ON MEXICO SIDE IN THE BATTLE FOR THE RATIFICATION OF THE US MCA IN THE U. S. CONGRESS. SECOND ATTITUDES TOWARDS UNITED STATES IN MEXICO. MEXICANS DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN UNITED STATES AND PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THEIR ATTITUDES BUT POLLS ALSO SHOW THAT MEXICANS ARE NOT CLAMORING FOR LOPEZ OBRADOR TO BACK. TO HIT BACK AT TRUMP FOR AS IMMIGRATION POLICIES HIS CALL FOR A WALL HIS RHETORICAL ATTACKS ON MEXICO THIS GIVES LOPEZ OBRADOR A LOT OF DOMESTIC FLEXIBILITY TO CONTINUE HIS CURRENT POLICY. AND THIRD AT THE SAME TIME TRUMP'S APPARENT RESPECT FOR LOPEZ OBRADOR SEEMS TO INFORMACIóN AGENT NOT TO CRITICIZE IT MEXICO'S PRESIDENT PERSONALLY WHILE HE REGULARLY CRITICIZES MEXICO. TRUMP HAS YET TO CRITICIZE LOPEZ OBRADOR. ALL THIS HELPS TO EXPLAIN WHY THERE HAS NOT BEEN AND WHY IT'S UNLIKELY THERE WILL BE A MAJOR CLASH BETWEEN UNITED STATES AND MEXICO IN THE COMING MONTHS. HOWEVER IT ALSO MEANS THEY'RE UNLIKELY TO BE ANY POSITIVE INITIATIVES EMANATING FROM MEXICO CITY OR WASHINGTON TO DEAL WITH ARE SURE CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES. THAT LEAVES A LOT OF ROOM FOR CALIFORNIA TO FILL THE VOID. INDEED CALIFORNIA SHOULD TAKE THE LEAD ON BUILDING A STRONGER BI LATERAL COLLABORATION GIVEN HOW MUCH MEXICO MATTERS TO CALIFORNIA. LET ME OFFER A QUICK REMINDER WHICH YOU PROBABLY ALREADY KNOW WHICH IS HOW MUCH MEXICO MATTERS. TO CALIFORNIA BEYOND MEXICO'S OBVIOUS INFLUENCE ON OUR DEMOCRACY AND OUR CULTURE MEXICO HAS IN STORE NEARLY IMPORTANT TO THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY. MEXICO'S CALIFORNIA'S NUMBER ONE EXPORT MARKET TAKING OVER THIRTY BILLION DOLLARS IN CALIFORNIA EXPORTS. THAT AMOUNTS TO ABOUT 17% OF TOTAL EXPORTS THE CALIFORNIA FOR CALIFORNIA. THAT TRANSLATES TO NEARLY SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND JOBS IN CALIFORNIA. MEXICO IS ALSO A NUMBER TO SOURCE OF IMPORTED GOODS AND BY FAR THE NUMBER ONE ORIGIN FOREIGN TRAVELERS TO CALIFORNIA. AND MEXICAN COMPANIES OPERATE IN CALIFORNIA CREATING THOUSANDS MORE JOBS. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY IS THE CALIFORNIA'STRADE WITH MEXICO ACTUALLY OCCURS WITHIN THE SAME CLASSES OF GOODS. MACHINERY VEHICLES MEDICAL INSTRUMENTS AND ELECTRONICS AND ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT WHAT THAT MEANS IS WE DON'T JUST TRADE WITH ONE ANOTHER WE PRODUCE GOODS TOGETHER THROUGH CROSS BORDER SUPPLY CHAINS. THIS IS PARTICULARLY PRONOUNCED FOR COMPANIES IN THE SAN DIEGO TO QUAN A REGION WHERE RESEARCH DEVELOPMENT AND DESIGN. ACTIVITIES TAKE PLACE IN SAN DIEGO FOR THE MANUFACTURING INCLUDING HIGH TECH MANUFACTURING TAKES PLACE IN TIJUANA. MEXICO THOSE MATTERS ENORMOUSLY TO CALIFORNIA. SO WHERE THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR ENGAGEMENT BETWEEN CALIFORNIA MEXICO. THERE ARE MULTIPLE BILATERAL PROBLEMS AS WELL AS OPPORTUNITIES THAT WOULD BENEFIT FROM DEEPER COLLABORATION BETWEEN CALIFORNIA MEXICO. SOME OF THESE INCLUDE MIGRATION EDUCATION ECONOMY WHICH I'LL LEAVE THAT UP TO MY COLLEAGUES ON THE PANEL TO DISCUSS TODAY I'D LIKE TO FOCUS ON SECURITY AND ENERGY ISSUES BRIEFLY. BEFORE I TURN TO THESE ISSUES I WANT TO EMPHASIZE ABROAD OPPORTUNITY FOR CALIFORNIA ON THE POLITICAL HORIZON. THE STATE OF BAJA CALIFORNIA WILL ELECT A NEW GOVERNOR AND A NEW LEGISLATURE ON JUNE SECOND. THIS GIVES CALIFORNIA THE OPPORTUNITY TO QUICKLY CONGRATULATE THE VICTOR AND TO MAKE IT EARLY OFFER OF BI LATERAL COLLABORATION IN THE AREAS WITH THE NEW BAJA CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT THINKS IT WOULD BE BENEFICIAL. SO LET ME NOW TURN TO SECURITY. MEXICO IS THERE ANYTHING SECURITY CRISIS DRIVEN BY THE ACTIVITIES OF ORGANIZED CRIME AND GANGS WHICH ARE CONCENTRATED IN CERTAIN STATES AND CERTAIN MUNICIPALITIES. ANY HELP UNITED STATES CAN PROVIDE MEXICO IN LOWERING WHAT IS WHICH IS ONE OF THE HIGHEST MURDER RATES IN THE WORLD WOULD BE BENEFICIAL OBVIOUSLY IN TERMS OF PERSONAL SECURITY IN MEXICO HUMAN RIGHTS. AND POLITICAL STABILITY AND A FRIENDLY NEIGHBORING COUNTRY. BUT ENHANCING SECURITY IN MEXICO IS ALSO IN THE IMMEDIATE INTEREST OF CALIFORNIA. THIS IS NOT BECAUSE OF THE THREAT OF CRIME SPREADING OVER THE BORDER FROM MEXICO INTO CALIFORNIA. DECADES OF EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT THIS RARELY HAPPENS. FOR CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA THE MOST IMPORTANT IMPACT OF SECURITY IN MEXICO IS DEAD IT'S INSTEAD ITS ECONOMIC IMPACT. IT'S NOT JUST ON THE MEXICAN ECONOMY AND THEREFORE US TRADE WITH MEXICO BUT GIVEN THE INTERDEPENDENCE BETWEEN OUR TWO ECONOMIES THE IMPACT IS ON THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY IN CALIFORNIA PRODUCTION AS WELL. WE KNOW THAT DEALING WITH CRIME AND VIOLENCE IN MEXICO'S ELSEWHERE ULTIMATELY DEPENDS ON THE CAPACITY OF LOCAL POLICE FORCES. BUT LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT IN MEXICO IS IN NEED OF SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT. AT THE SAME TIME MOST OF CALIFORNIA CITIES ARE PATROLLED BY HOW WELL TRAINED HIGHLY CAPABLE POLICE FORCES MANY OF WHICH HAVE HAD SUCCESSFUL EXPERIENCES AND FIGHT IN THE KIND OF GANG VIOLENCETHAT NOW CONFRONTS MEXICAN POLICE. CALIFORNIA CAN BRING ITS EXPERIENCE TO MEXICO. INDEED THE SAN DIEGO POLICE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE TO QUAN A POLICE TO HELP THEM DEVELOP EFFECTIVE COMMUNITY POLICING. IN ORDER TO REDUCE VIOLENCE AND THE BROADER ACTIVITY OF GANGS AND ORGANIZED CRIME. THIS KIND OF CLOSE COLLABORATION BETWEEN MEXICAN AND I'M CALIFORNIAN LOCAL POLICE COULD BE EXPANDED TO INCLUDE OTHER CALIFORNIA CITIES AND OTHER MEXICAN CITIES. LET ME TURN NOW TO THE QUESTION OF ENERGY -- I BELIEVE THERE'S ROOM FOR COLLABORATION IN THE AREA OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND SPECIFICALLY IN CLEAN ENERGY. GENERATION. UNLIKE THE PREVIOUS TWO ADMINISTRATIONS IN MEXICO CITY THE LOCALS OVERLORD MINISTRATION IS NOT FOCUSED ON THE ISSUE OF CLIMATE CHANGE BUT STATE GOVERNMENTS ARE. AND THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE IN THE NEIGHBORING STATES OF BAJA CALIFORNIA AND SONORA WHERE THEY WANT TO REDUCE THEIR ARBON FOOTPRINT BY INCREASING WIND AND SOLAR POWER USAGE. CALIFORNIA IS OBVIOUSLY A LEADER AND GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE INCLUDING THE INTEGRATION OF WIND AND SOLAR POWER INTO ITS ELECTRICITY GENERATION MATRIX. AND IS HOME TO A WIDE ARRAY OF COMPANIES THAT ARE DEDICATED TO WIN POWER GENERATION AS WELL AS BOTH LARGE SCALE SOLAR FARMS AND THE SMALLER SCALE DISTRIBUTED GENERATION SYSTEMS THAT PUT SOLAR PANELS. ON THE ROOFTOPS OF BUSINESSES AND HOMES. CALIFORNIA IS THUS AN IDEAL POSITION TO REACH OUT TO THE NEW BAJA CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT IN JUNE TO OFFER A BROAD BASED COLLABORATION AND LOCAL POLICING AND EXPANDING LOW CARBON ENERGY GENERATION AND THE CALIFORNIA BEHALF OF REGION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH [inaudible] THANK YOU. DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE [inaudible] YEAH. OKAY WE'RE GONNA. THANK YOU DOCTOR STAR CLOSE. OUR NEXT PRESENTATION BE -- BY DR ANDREW [inaudible] SALLY. OF PRESIDENT OF THE MIGRATION POLICY INSTITUTE IN WASHINGTON DC. PRIOR TO THAT HE SPENT SEVENTEEN YEARS AT THE WOODROW WILSON CENTER WHERE HE FOUNDED THE CENTER. THE CENTERS MEXICO INSTITUTE LATER SERVED AS VICE PRESIDENT FOR PROGRAMS. AND EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT IS ALSO HE HAS ALSO WORKED AS STAFF IN THE US CONGRESS. AND ON DEVELOPMENT [inaudible] OF OF MIGRATION PROGRAMS IN TIJUANA MEXICO WELCOME THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY YOU SENATOR. I'M FOR YOU CENTER THE RANKING MEMBER THANK YOU ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE THE COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE -- I WANTED TO START OFF A MINUTE THERE'S PLANO CLEAR REPRESENTATION OF THE COMPLEX AND PRODUCTIVE LINKS BETWEEN CALIFORNIA MEXICO. THEN SOMETHING THAT IS IN YOUR DISTRICTS THAT ARE AND THAT IS THE AIRPORT BRIDGE THAT IS THE CONNECTS THE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK EVERYONE HERE BY KNOWS THE STORY BUT IT'S WORTH. THE CITY YES EXACT AS HE BE EXIT IS WORTH RECOUNTING BECAUSE FOR YEARS I LIVED IN SAN DIEGO AND TIJUANA FOR MANY YEARS AND FR YEARS. IF NOT DECADES PEOPLE INCENDIO DEBATED WHERE TO PUT A NEW AIRPORT. THIS WAS A DEBATE THAT RAGED BECAUSE YOU KNOW FOR ALL THOSE THAT ARE FLOWN INTO THE SAN DIEGO AIRPORT IT IS A BEAUTIFUL BUT SMALL AIRPORT IN THE MIDDLE OF TOWN. A EVENTUALLY AFTER MUCH DISCUSSION THE ANSWER WAS NOT BILLION AIRPORT IN SAN DIEGO IT WAS ACTUALLY JOINING FORCES WITH THE ONE NEED TO BUILD A BRIDGE ACROSS THE BORDER FENCE. AND ACTUALLY CONNECT THE TWO CITIES ALLOW PEOPLE TO USE AIRPORT IS A LARGER AIRPORT THAT'S RIGHT ON THE BORDER. IN A VERY PRAGMATIC WAY -- ALLOW PEOPLE FROM SAN DIEGO ACCESS WHAT THE ONE ALREADY HAD AND IT'S BEEN IN MANY WAYS A SYMBOL FOR WHAT'S IN THE ON THE ONE ARE DOING TOGETHER TO CITIES THAT HAVE ACTUALLY DISCOVER THAT THEY HAVE MORE IN COMMON. THAN THEY EVER IMAGINED THE MORE COMMON THAN I WOULD HAVE REALIZE WHEN I LIVED IN THE REGION THE NINETEEN NINETIES I MEAN THIS IS. THE ONE AS BEING MORE OF A MIDDLE CLASS CITY MORE THAN INNOVATIVE CITY AS A SAN DIEGO SANDY WAS BECOME A CITY OF INNOVATION AS WELL -- AND WITH ENORMOUS AS DOCTOR STAR SAID A MINUTE AGO WITH ENORMOUS COMPLEMENTARITY IS IN TERMS OF OF THEIR INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION AND THERE ARE DE SO WHAT IS THE SAME THINGS THAT ARE PRODUCED IN SAN DIEGO ARE PRODUCED IN THE ONE A BUT YOU HAVE DIFFERENT PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES. MAKING THINGS TOGETHER THIS IS IN MANY WAYS -- AND AND AND PEOPLE'S AND THE ONE IN -- INCREASINGLY TALK ABOUT A COMMON METROPOLITAN AREA -- IT IS FASCINATING TO SEE TO CITIES THAT I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF IT I BROUGHT ABOUT MANY YEARS AGO AS BEING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT TWENTY OUT TO BE ACTUALLY MUCH MORE SIMILAR TO THE ONE THING BUT BUT IN SOME WAYS. SEVENTY ONE ARE MICROCOSM OF THE BROADER RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CALIFORNIA. IN MEXICO. ARM CLOSE TO A THIRD OF CALIFORNIANS TRACE THEIR RELATIONSHIP THEIR HERITAGE TO MEXICO. THE STATE DEPENDS ON MEXICO'S LARGEST MARKET FOR STATE EXPORTS OVER TWENTY FIVE BUT BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. THESE ARE STATES ARE INEXTRICABLY LINKED. AND IF THE BORDER COMMUNITIES ARE AT THE FRONT LINES OF THIS RELATIONSHIP INDUBITABLY INCREASINGLY ALL OF CALIFORNIA'S TRULY PART OF THE BORDER TODAY ARM. AND I WOULD ACTUALLY MAKE THIS ARGUMENT FOR THE UNITED STATES AS A WHOLE MANY INCREASINGLY WE ARE SEEING. BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND MEXICO THE BORDER IS EXPANDING. DETROIT IS IN MANY WAYS A BORDER CITY TO DETROIT DEPENDS ON BOTH CANADA AND MEXICO SAN ANTONIO AND DALLAS OR CERTAINLY BORDER CITIES LOS ANGELES IS CERTAINLY BORDER CITY. BUT ONE COULD ARGUE THAT SACRAMENTO WAS ALSO BORDERS. INCREASINGLY THE BORDERS EVERYWHERE BECAUSE OUR ECONOMY DEPENDS ON OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH MEXICO IN VERY DEEP WAYS. ARM IN FACT IN THE FIRST TWO MONTHS OF THIS YEAR MEXICO WAS AMERICA'S LEADING TRADE PARTNER. HAS GENERALLY BEEN OUR THIRD TRADE PARTNER SECOND DESTINATION FOR EXPORTS BUT THROUGH JANUARY FEBRUARY WE HAVEN'T SEEN MARCH AND APRIL YET -- MEXICO WAS ACTUALLY LEADING TRADE PARTNER IN A LOT OF HAS TO DO WITH ACTUALLY THE TRADE WAR WITH CHINA. BUT IT'S ACTUALLY NORMALLY EVEN IN A REGULAR MONTH THEY'RE ALL VERY CLOSE ACTUALLY MEXICO WAS MOVED UP VERY CLOSE TO CANADA AND CHINA. BUT WHAT WE'VE SEEN. TRADING CREASE FIVE TIMES SINCE NAFTA WAS IMPLEMENTED A WE'VE SEEN CALMER AND WE'VE SEEN THE TRANSIT OF PEOPLE ACROSS THE BORDER INCREASE EXPONENTIALLY AS WELL. WE HAVE NOT SEEN THE KIND OF FEDERAL INVESTMENTS WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR BORDER FUNCTIONS EFFECTIVELY. THAT SO THIS IS WHAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT TODAY. ALL AT THE SAME TIME ON AUTHORIZED FLOWS AS WE WE HAVE A FULL COMMITTEE TODAY AGREED -- THE CENTER ON AUTHORIZED FLOWS HAVE ACTUALLY INCREASED HOW MANY OF US HAVE SAID FOR YEARS THAT ON AUTHORIZED CLOSE WE'RE GOING DOWN IT WAS TRUE -- BUT WE HAVE SEEN AN INCREASE IN CENTRAL AMERICA NOT MEXICAN FLOWS IN RECENT MONTHS AND IT'S NOTICEABLE AND I THINK IT MAY BE HERE TO STAY FOR A PERIOD OF TIME -- AND SO THERE AT LEAST THREE CHALLENGES THE REQUIRE FEDERAL ACTION. AND WITHOUT FEDERAL ACTION LEAVE CALIFORNIA IN A DIFFICULT SITUATION AS MANY BORDER STATES. ARM AND WHICH CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA POLICY MAKERS CAN PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN IN PUSHING FORWARD. ME JUST POINT THESE OUT ONE IS INVESTING IN PORTS OF ENTRY AND I DON'T SOMETHING YOU'VE WORKED ON A GREAT DEAL HERE -- OUR PORTS OF ENTRY HAVE NOT KEPT UP EITHER IN QUANTITY OR QUALITY WITH THE TRAFFIC THAT WE SEE. COMING ACROSS PRETTY THE COMMERCIAL TRAFFIC AND WE'VE ACTUALLY SEEN A REDIRECTION OF OF PORT PERSONNEL. TO SUPPORTING THE BORDER PATROL WHICH IS ACTUALLY SLOW DOWN COMMERCE RECENTLY BUT THIS IS A LONG TERM ISSUE -- YOU'LL HEAR I BELIEVE NEXT ACTUALLY FROM A CUT ABOVE THE SO I I WILL STEAL HIS THUNDER HE WILL TALK ABOUT THIS. BUT THERE IS AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF CREATIVITY GOING ON IN UNIFIED CARGO PROCESSING WHERE WE HAVE U. S. MAX AND INSPECTORS COLOCATED TOGETHER TO DO A SINGLE INSPECTION INSTEAD OF TWO INSPECTIONS. PRE INSPECTION BEFORE THINGS GET TO THE BORDER HOW DO WE BEGIN TO ACTUALLY MONITOR FLOWS ROWS OF TRADE AND FLOWS OF PEOPLE RATHER THAN TRYING TO STOP PEOPLE THE BORDER. YES WE STOP EVERYONE OF THE BORDER BUT YOU DO A CURSORY CHECK AT THE BORDER IF YOU'VE ACTUALLY MONITOR THE FLOW BEFORE IT GETS TO THE BORDER -- AND YOU KNOW PUSHING THE BORDER OUT BEYOND THE BORDER ITSELF AND THEN USING NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO DETECT CONTRABAND BUT ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE STILL THEIR INFANT STAGE. THEY ALL NEED TO BE UP SCALED UP SIGNIFICANTLY AND THIS NEEDS ACTUALLY FEDERAL INVESTMENT IN FEDERAL COMMITMENT. SECONDLY MAKING ASYLUM PROCESSING MORE EFFICIENT AND TIMELY WOULD BE KEY TO DEALING WITH WITH THE UNAUTHORIZED FLOWS WE'RE SEEING. RIGHT NOW IT TAKES BETWEEN TWO TO FOUR YEARS TO GET ASYLUM HEARING IS ALL ASYLUM CASES GO TO THE COURTS THE IMMIGRATION COURTS WHICH ARE OVERLOADED. THERE IS A ACTUALLY A PRACTICAL WAY OF DEALING WITH THIS WHICH IS YOU COULD ACTUALLY HAVE ASYLUM OFFICERS BY CALLING DORIS MEISNER. OF FORMER COMMISSIONER MINUSES ACTUALLY WORKE ON THIS YOU COULD YOU COULD ACTUALLY PUT UP -- ALLOW ASYLUM OFFICERS TO MAKE THE DECISION ON ASYLUM SPEED UP PROCESSING TIMES TO MONTHS RATHER THAN YEARS. I WOULD BE SUNNY MUCH MORE FAIR TO PEOPLE THAT ARE FLEEING FROM VIOLENCE WERE FLEEING FROM PERSECUTION AND AT THE SAME TIME WOULD BE A DETERRENT THE PEOPLE DID NOT A STRONG CLAIMS. I'M AND THE THIRD THING IS WE HAVE LOST WHAT HAPPENED IN THE PAST WHICH WAS ONGOING CONSULTATIONS BETWEEN THE US AND MEXICAN GOVERNMENTS AROUND A BROAD RANGE OF ISSUES. AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IT AT THE BEST POINTS INCLUDED STATES AND LOCALITIES -- ON EVERYTHING FROM MIGRATION AND TRADE THE PUBLIC SECURITY IN CHAIRED BY MENTAL CHALLENGES WE USED WE'VE HAD UNDER BOTH THE A BOMB OF THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION. CONSULTATIONS THAT TOOK PLACE FAIRLY REGULARLY DIFFERENT STRUCTURES IN EACH CASE BUT THESE SEEM TO HAVE BROKEN DOWN. I THINK YOU'LL HEAR FROM MY COLLEAGUE DR DR PHIL BUT AS A CUSTOMER THIS IS ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY FOR STATES TO STEP IN. BUT I THINK PART OF WERE STATES NEED TO STEP IT IS ACTUALLY OVER TIME WE CONSTRUCTING THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP BECAUSE WE'VE LOST SOME OF THE ARCHITECTURE. THAT ADE THINGS FLOW EASILY WHEN YOU LOSE THAT ARCHITECTURE YOU LOSE THE ABILITY TO RESPOND. TO CHANGING CIRCUMSTANCES AND YOU LOSE THE ABILITY TO BE CREATIVE GOING FORWARD. SOIN CONCLUSION LET ME SAY THE BORDER REGION WHICH NOW INCLUDES THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA INCLUDING WHERE WE ARE SITTING IN SACRAMENTO. IS ONE OF THE MOST NOT ONLY SAN DIEGO ITSELF WHERE THE SENATORS FROM BUT BUT ALL OF US HERE. IN A WORD IN STATE IS ONE OF THE MOST FERTILEREGIONS FOR INNOVATION AND CREATIVE PROBLEM SOLVING. BUT A LACK OF PROACTIVE ATTENTION TO THIS RELATIONSHIP -- AND SOME OF THE POLICY DECISIONS IN THE DEBATE TO ME MADE ARE GOING TO BE GETTING THE FULL VALUE. THAT WE COULD BE GETTING OUT OF THIS RELATIONSHIP THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANKS FOR BEING HERE. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS WE GOT A LITTLE BIT ULTRA HE IS THE GENERAL ADMINISTRATOR OF CUSTOMS AND FOREIGN TRADE IN MEXICO. FOR THEIR ASSIDUOUS YOU'LL THAT MANY SUBSTANTIVE THREE WITH THE IDEA.

FIRST UP IS DR RAFAEL FERNANDEZ THE CASTRO HE'S THE DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER OF US. MEXICAN STUDIES AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN DIEGO. IS A FORMER. POLICY ADVISER TO PRESIDENT POLITICAL THAT ON DR FERNANDEZ ACOSTA IS AN EXPERT ON BI NATIONAL OF BILATERAL RELATIONS BETWEEN MEXICO AND THE US. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE WE REALLY APPRECIATE. JOINING US TODAY ON THE CONTRARY SENATOR WAS WIND DESCEND OWNER FOR ME 2% -- MY VIEWS ON TO SHARE MY EXPERIENCE. WHEN DOES MEXICO RELATIONS SIMA A NEW ADULT OF CALIFORNIANS HI I DON'T EVEN SEND DEAL FOR A LITTLE LESS THAN TWO YEARS? ON THE NIGHT. COMPUTER OPENLY TWADDLE KATE FOR A STRONGER RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CALIFORNIA AND MEXICO. I DO BELIEVE ON THAT ISN'T MY ARGUMENT THAT THE TRUMP WHITE HOUSE REPRESENTS AN OPPORTUNITY. FOR CALIFORNIA MEXICO TO STRENGTHEN. IT'S CONNECTIONS SO WHY ARE AMONG THE SAYING THESE. OLD BECAUSE SO. THE MEXICAN STRATEGY -- THE MEXICAN DIPLOMATIC STRATEGY DURING THE LAST -- TWENTY FIVE YEARS. HAD BEEN TO CONCENTRATE RELATIONS AT THE TOP THE MOST IMPORTANT DECISIONS WERE MADE AT THE TOP UP BASIC ELEVATED TO BY THE TWO PRESIDENTS. NAFTA. CAME ABOUT. IN A IN A DIVERSE CONVERSATION BETWEEN BIRTH FORTY FIRST AND CAL SELLING THAT IT WORKED OUT. I'M JUST TO TO ILLUSTRATE MY POINT LET ME SHARE WITH YOU AN ANECDOTE THAT I THAT I BELIEVE -- WORKING FOR PRISON BECAUSE THEY DON'T. WHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA BE IT WAS PROCEED PRESIDENT ELECT EVERY SINGLE FOR EITHER WAS TRYING TO GET TOGETHER WITH HIM AT THE TIME HE WAS? THE SINGLE MOST POPULAR POLITICIAN IN THE WORLD I WOULD PUT IT THAT WAY [inaudible] THE ONLY. POORLY THE WHO WAS ABLE. TO GET TOGETHER WITH PRESIDENT ELECT OBAMA WAS PHILIP BECAUSE IT'LL FROM MEXICO. THAT HAPPENS A ONLY NINE DAYS BEFORE INTEGRATION AND I REMEMBER VIVIDLY THAT THEY OBAMA WAS VERY GRACIOUS HE CAME TO BE SAID PRESSING CALDERON OF THE MEXICAN CULTURAL INSTITUTE IN WASHINGTON. THE COVER LAUNCH THAT WENT OVER. ALMOST TWO HOURS ON THE PRISON CALDERON CAME OUT OF THE MEETING VERY HAPPY AND HE TOLD US WHEN WE WERE PREPARING HE FORTY PRESS CONFERENCE. YOU KNOW BARACK A NIGHT WHEN HE SAID BARAK WE CERTAINLY REALIZED THAT I WOULD MISSION THAT MISSION ACCOMPLISHED. BECAUSE THE IDEA OF THE MEETINGS IS THAT THEY BASICALLY NEW CHARTER THAT THE CREATE THE PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP AND THE CALL. TO TALK TO THE RENTALS WE FIND OUT DURING THE MEETING THAT WE BOTH ARE LEFT HANDED. AND THAT WE BOUGHT. OUR LAWYERS THAT WE WENT TO HARVARD AND THAT OUR SPOUSES MARGARITA MICHELLE OUR DAUGHTER AND BOTH WERE DONE HOUSE. THAT HE'S. VERY KEEN. BECAUSE THANKS TO THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO COOLEY CHILDREN ALL THE TIME AND BELIEVE ME THAT HELP US OUT WILL THAT CANNOT HAPPEN WITH MR TRUMP. ASK PRIME MINISTER TRUDEAU. OSCAR THE PRESIDENT OF FRANCE EMERALD ACROSS I MEAN IT'S VERY HARD. TO GET TOGETHER WITH HIM AND HE'S. IN A WAY. READ DR I WOULD PUT IT THAT WAY SO WHAT IS. WHAT MEXICO SHOULD DO? VERY SIMPLE IS TO PAY THE DECENTRALIZE GAME. OF AMERICAN POLITICS. IN THAT THE CENTRAL IS GAME CALIFORNIA'S SEKI OCTOBER ON A WOULD SAY THAT THERE'S SUCH AN ENORMOUS OPPORTUNITY FOR MEXICO CALIFORNIA TO STRENGTHEN. THE ELATIONSHIP NOT ONLY THAT CALIFORNIA HAS BECOME A VERY PROGRESSIVE -- STATE AND I WOULD SAY. CALIFORNIA HAS BECOME VERY PROGRESSIVE BECAUSE JUNE LATINO POLITICIANS BECAUSE YOU LET THE NO. A LEGISLATORS UP SEVENTY YEARS AGO WHEN V<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; BOLD WAS FIRST&lt;/c&gt;</u> ELECTED TO CONGRESS I WILL TAKE. YOU LET THE NO -- BECAME EMPOWERED IN THE SERVER IN THE STATE OF THANKS TO YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA'S PRE PROGRESSIVE I BELIEVE. THAT EACH ONE OF YOU ARE PUTTING A VERY FIGHT VERY STRONG FIVE PIECE OF THE TO TRUMP. SOME POLICIES BECAUSE I KNOW PEOPLE HAVE UNIVERSITA LIKE MEDINA TOLD US WHAT YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR CHILDREN. OR YOU GOT CHILDREN THEY DON'T THEY WILL NOT BE SUBJECT TO THE PROBLEMS. THE DISCRIMINATION YOU WERE SUBJECT WHEN YOU WHICH SOLD I BELIEVE THAT IN THAT SENSE CALIFORNIA'S AND NATURAL PARTED TO MEXICAN IMMIGRATION ISSUES. IN MEXICO I WOULD SAY WE'VE BEEN UP WITH THE ELECTION OF UNDER IS A NEW LOW PURSUE A LITTLE WE ON THE WINTER POLITICAL TO NOT ME -- BUT THIS IS THE VERY FIRST TIME EVER THAT A LEFTIST POLITICIAN IS ELECTED TO OFFICE. AND THEN THERE IS MINERAL PERSONA Là ASPIRINS INTELLECTUALS WEEKS INTO HE'S BEING PRESIDENT ELECT HE MERRY HE MADE IT MADE YOUR DECISION. REPORTING POLICY DECISION ON AN ECONOMIC POLICY DECISION THAT TO ME HAS BEEN THE BEST SO FAR. SINCE HE WAS ELECTED PRESIDENT HE DECIDED TO BUCK THE NAFTA RENEGOTIATION. ON BECAUSE BUT DIDN'T THE PINION MINISTRATION THE BINNYA OPINION IF THE MUSICIAN WAS ABLE CLOSE -- THE NOT THE RENEGOTIATION AND AND NOW WE HAVE THE US MCA. THAT IS A VERY IMPORTANT AGREEMENT BECAUSE IF WE ARE ABLE. TO GET THE THREE CONGRESS TO BUZZ YOU AGREEMENT I BELIEVE THAT THE AGREEMENT WILL HELP. A LOT. THE INTEGRATION BETWEEN CON OTHER MEXICAN DID YOU. HE WE HELP THE AGREEMENT I WOULD SAY. THE INTEGRATION OF MEXICAN THE US. WILL BE MUCH STRONGER AND WILL BE MORE UPON ALMOST ALL OF THE WHEEL OF PRESIDENT TRUMP OR EVEN PRESSING Là SODA. THAT IS WHY AGREEMENTS ARE FOR BECAUSE THEN WOULD NOT DEPEND SO MUCH ON THE WHEELS. OFF OF A PERSON AND I BELIEVE THAT WE BADLY NEED YOU D. D. U. S. M. C. EIGHT TO BE. RATIFIED TO BE APPROVED BY CONGRESS I BELIEVE THE CALIFORNIA COULD PLAY A PIVOTAL ROLE IN THE NIGHT LET ME FINISH MY MIGHT -- TESTIMONY BY BY PRESENTED YOU I WOULD SAY WITH -- THREE PROPOSALS NUMBER ONE IS ALI FORCED THE CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIANS SPECIALLY THE CALIFORNIA SENATE AND ASSEMBLY. TO HELP GIVE THE RATIFICATION OF NAFTA THESE THESE WOULD BE FOR THE WELL BEING OF MEXICANS AND AMERICANS AND CANADIANS. AND I HOPE IT ALSO WILL BE FOR THE WELLBEING OF CENTRAL AMERICANS I BELIEVE THAT WE REALLY HAVE TO PUT A WE'RE A TOGETHER REGARDING THE NORDEN TRIANGLE OFTEN TELL THEM. SECOND I WILL. FOR CALIFORNIA AND I KNOW AND I KNOW YOU SAID NOT TO WEAR SO YOU HAVE BEEN A CHAMPION. IN OTHER CREATING FOUR NEW MECHANISMS OF CONSULTATION BETWEEN CALIFORNIA MEXICO YOU'RE ADVOCATING FOR A NEW COMMISSION. I BELIEVE ALSO THAT HE THESE WOULD BE THE TIME. TO CALM CALM WHAT AGAIN ONCE AGAIN. WITH THE THREE CALIFORNIA'S COMMISSION SEEMS TO ME THAT NOWADAYS WOULD REALLY HAVE TO PUT AWAY DOCTOR BECAUSE THEY WOULD HAVE THESE MECHANISMS TO BETTER COORDINATE. TO BETTER COOPERATE AND ON TO COUGH UP A MECHANISM TO TALK TO EACH OTHER WE NEED TO HAVE THIS QUOTE COSTA DIE AND THERE'S IN BAJA CALIFORNIA THERE'S A COMMON ELECTION. NEXT JUNE SECOND AND SEES TO ME THAT THESE THESE WOULD BE A VERY GOOD MOMENT. FORTIFIED ON TO COME ONCE AGAIN WITH THIS THE HEAD THREE CALIFORNIA COMMISSION BECAUSE SEEMS TO ME THAT WE COULD -- WE COULD ADVANCE HELLO -- AMONG THE THREE CALIFORNIA'S AND FINALLY LET ME COME TO A LOCAL ISSUE. AT THE CENTER OF HIS MATERNAL STORIES DURING THE LAST FIVE YEARS -- OF MY THE D. ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR MILES'S OF LOCUSTS SHE'S BEEN DOING THESE WONDERFUL RESEARCH THAT WE CALLED. THE STUDENTS WE SHARE WHAT WE HAVE FOUND OUT THERE THAT THERE'S A LOT OF STUDENTS THAT WE SURE FOR EXAMPLE. WHEN WE PAULINE AND WE DO THIS WITH STUDENTS FROM YOU? YOU SEE IS THE WE KNOW THAT. IN SELDOM SAN DIEGO ONE OUT OF FIVE STUDENTS THE COPS HOME -- EXPERIENCE IN. EDUCATION ACROSS THE BORDER. NINETY ONE I WILL REPORT INSTANT WE KNOW THAT ONE OUT OF TEN STUDENTS THE CUFF FROM EXPERIENCE. IN EDUCATION IN CALIFORNIA SO THERE IS LITERALLY I MEAN WE CONCENTRATE. SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WE CONCENTRATE. A VERY LARGE NUMBERS OF STUDENTS THAT WE SHARE THEY ARE BI LINGUAL THEY FEEL BI NATIONAL. GUESS WHAT. THEY DON'T GET EIGHTEEN THE EDUCATION OF THE NEED TO BE CALM THE WAR FORCE THAT WE NEED WHY BECAUSE THE BORDER IS VERY HEAVY INTO HIMSELF EDUCATION. BECAUSE OF NAFTA WE LEARNED HOW TO BUTTE PRODUCE ACOSTA ACROSS THE BORDER. LEARN HOW TO BETTER ROUTE. STRAIGHT ACROSS THE BORDER AND WE HAVE TO DO DOT. PREDICATION SO I BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF POTENTIAL. BETWEEN CALIFORNIA AND MEXICO AND SEEMS TO ME THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS GIVEN OF AN ENORMOUS OPPORTUNITY TO STRENGTHEN. OUR RELATIONSHIP AND I AGAIN. REYES YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THE U. LATINO [inaudible] THE POLITICIANS POLICY MAKER. YOU YOU. TWO IN A WONDERFUL JOB IN IN IN MAKING SURE THAT CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO BE A VERY PROGRESSIVE THE STATE AND HE'S HELPING [inaudible] MEXICANS. OLD CONDITIONS IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU HAVE TO COME DOCUMENTS. OUR STATE. I WILL STOP HERE ON A YOU CAN APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY BEFORE REDUCE. SEN THE DESCENT OF COMMISSION THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY FISHING YOU BEING HERE AND ENSURING THOSE COMMENTS JUST -- IT'S IT'S AMAZING THE HISTORY OF THE AMERICAS IS IS VERY SIMILAR. AND THERE THERE HAVE BEEN. OVER THE OVER THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE AMERICAS A LOT OF EUROPEAN. INFLUENCE AND HOW THE AMERICANS WERE DEVELOPED AND IT'S VERY INTERESTING TO ME THAT. A LOT OF THIS WAS EUROPE. FIGHTING WITH EACH OTHER AND STILL EXPAND FINDING -- MARKETS TO EXPAND AND BAD WHAT'S MOST INTERESTING MEETING OVER THE COURSE OF HISTORY. EUROPE UNITED IN CREATED ONE ECONOMY WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION. AND WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE STRUGGLING TO DO THAT EVEN AT THE SMALLEST LEVEL WHICH IS NAFTA. AND AND AND I I THINK I JUST GENERALLY BELIEVE MORE CAN BE DONE IN THAT AREA I THINK -- WHAT WERE WERE VERY WEAK WEAK AND HOW IT WE'VE UNITED OUR ECONOMIES [inaudible] BUT CURRENTLY. YOU HAVE YOU HAVE. CHINA MAKING AN ENORMOUS INROADS. IN REACHING OUT TO A LOT OF LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES INCLUDING MEXICO IN TRYING TO EXPAND THEIR MARKETS AND WERE NOT REALLY TAKING ADVANTAGE. A VERY CLOSE PARTNERS IN VERY CLOSE ALLIES. AND AND WHAT WE CAN DO TO BENEFIT FROM OUR GEOGRAPHICAL PROXIMITY. TWO TWO VERY BIG ECONOMIC ALLIES AND I JUST THINK IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY LOST. BUT WE NEED TO DO MORE -- TO TO BRING ATTENTION TO THAT AND ALSO SEE WHERE WE CAN. BENEFIT FROM THAT RELATIONSHIP I THINK -- I I YOU KNOW THE IDEA OF EXPANDING THE BANK AND MAKING INVESTMENTS AND UNDERSERVED AREAS IN MEXICO I THINK THAT'S A VERY WORTHY WORTHY GOAL THAN IT WOULD. REAP ENORMOUS BENEFITS TO AMERICA'S WELL THOSE ARE THE THOSE SEEM LIKE INITIATIVES THAT WOULD. HELP US AS MUCH AS MEXICO AND THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS DIALOGUE IN THIS RELATIONSHIP. HOW CAN WE COMBINE OUR EFFORTS TO BUILD OUR RESPECTIVE ECONOMIES HOW HOW DO WE GET WEALTHY CALIFORNIA HOW CAN WE BUILD WEALTH IN MEXICO BUT GIVE GIVE A ON ECONOMIC. OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL THE PEOPLE OF OUR STATE ALL THE PEOPLE OF MEXICO A IN THAT IN THAT ARE FOR AND THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT. WE CAN BRING MORE INVESTMENT. TO OUR OUR ECONOMIES BY WORKING TOGETHER AND THERE ARE SO MANY AREAS THAT YOU'VE. THAT I'VE HEARD AND SOME OF THE PRESENTATIONS WERE WE CAN DO THAT AND AND AND MAKE THAT -- MORE MORE EFFICIENT THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE THANKS FOR COMMENTS. WE ALSO WE WANT TO MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT SPEAKER LISA METAL YOU COME FORWARD [inaudible] THE RELEASE. THANK YOU FOR A COME IN TODAY I SAW YOU IN THE AUDIENCE THERE WERE ARE YOU. I LEASES EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF COMEY THE SEQUEL THE VALUE A COMMUNITY BASED ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE NONPROFIT. BEST KNOWN FOR ITS CAMPAIGN TO COMBAT IN CONTROL HIGH LEVELS OF CHILDHOOD ASMAN CALIFORNIA'S IMPERIAL VALLEY AND SURROUNDING AREAS. FOR THIRTEEN YEARS OF MR MILL HAS ADVICE LOCAL REGIONAL STATE PROGRAMS ON ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AFFECTING RURAL COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA'S BORDER. WITH MEXICO. HE HAS ALSO BEEN INVOLVED IN LITIGATION AT THE LOCAL LEVEL TO FORCE GOVERNMENT REGULAR USED REGULATORS TO MORE EFFECTIVELY PROTECT. RESIDENTS FROM AIR POLLUTION AND FOR THAT WE WE THANK YOU NOT ENOUGH IS BEING DONE BUT WITH YOUR ADVOCACY -- WE WE ARE MAKING PROGRESS THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. THEY DINNER READY AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THE SHAPE THE IMITATION. I AND I DO HAVE A FEW. THANKS TO READ HERE BUT I DO WANT TO ALSO INCLUDED SOMETHING THAT ARE IN HERE -- BUT CALIFORNIA MEXICO -- SHOULD BE VIEWED IN MANAGE AS IT IS ONE DIVERSE REGION JERRY IN OUR WORKFORCE AND EXPERTISE FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE BORDER. THERE IS NO DIVIDING IN OUR REGION WHICH HAS HELPED DEVELOP THE NUMBER ONE ECONOMY IN OUR NATION OR CONTRIBUTE TO DEVELOPMENT. ARE THERE IS A SYMBIOTIC RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OUR ECONOMIES OF CALIFORNIAN MEDICAL CALIFORNIA PROVIDES AN ABUNDANCE OF RELATIVELY WELL PAYING OPPORTUNITIES. FOR MEXICO PROVIDES HUMAN CAPITAL IN CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY -- EQUALLY BENEFITING BOTH SIDES OF THE BORDER. THE RELATIONSHIP ISN'T LIMITED TO LABOR BOND IT ALSO EXTENDS THE FINANCIAL CLOUT OF CALIFORNIA HAS DEVELOPED. AS ONE OF THE TOP FIVE ECONOMIES IN THE WORLD. WITH TRADE BETWEEN CALIFORNIA MEXICO BI ONE OF THE MAIN DRIVING FORCES BEHIND THIS. TRADE ACROSS THE BORDER IS ONE OF THE MOST FRUITFUL INDUSTRIES IN THE BORDER. ESTIMATES THE US ECONOMY PUT A TRADE ACROSS THE BORDER OVER ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS DAY. WHICH FROM OUR LOCAL POINT OF VIEW CAN BE SEEN WITH AGRICULTURE TRADE. AND OTHER MANUFACTURING GOODS. IN OUR REGION WE SEE THE BORDER TRADE HAPPEN ON A DAILY BASIS WITH TRANSPORT BY GROUND FREIGHT INDUSTRY CROSSING. THE BORDER CONTINUOUSLY THROUGHOUT THE DAY EVEN OUTSIDE MAJOR GOODS TRADES. IF YOU WERE ABOUT TO WALK ON BOTH SIDES OF THE BORDER YOU WOULD SEE OUR SPOT INDIVIDUAL PURCHASING GOODS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE BORDER. AND TRANSPORTING THOSE GOODS OF DOUBLE SIDED BORDER WITH A TOM FORD WITH SOME VEHICLES. ARE THE CALIFORNIA ALSO STANCES AND ECONOMIC LEADER. BECAUSE OF THE AMOUNTS OF OF RICH RESOURCES. AND THE INCREASE IN TRADE ACROSS THE BORDER BY FACILITATING BY MULTIPLE TRADE AGREEMENTS. IF NOT FOR THIS TRADE WE WOULD BE LESS RICH OF A POSITION THAN WE ARE TODAY. FROM THE PERSPECTIVE AT THEBORDER. THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY TO GROW BECAUSE WE HAVE A DIVERSE JOB OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE. BECAUSE OF THE TRADE AND INNOVATION AND NEW TECHNOLOGIES WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A TRADE AND SHIPPING POSITIONS THAT HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY TO SUPPORT THEIR FAMILIES. AND GROW WITH THE REGION. WE HAVE ALSO SEEN INVESTMENT IN NEW TECHNOLOGIES WHERE BARREN LANDS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED TO SOLAR FARMS IN GREEN ENERGY INDUSTRIES. WHY THERE HAVE BEEN? ALWAYS A DESTRUCTIVE AMONG INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITIES. WHEN IT COMES TO FINANCIAL MATTERS IN SOME SECTORS? THIS IS TRUSTS IT'S NOT ON IS IS NOT NOT UNKNOWN TO US LIVING AT THE BORDER. WALL THE QUESTION AGAINST CROSS BORDER WORK AND TRADE IS ALWAYS WHERE TO DOLLARS AND UP. BUT WHILE THIS MAY BE A NATIONAL ARGUMENT WE FIRSTHAND SEE THAT THE DOLLARS ARE SPENT ON BOTH SIDES OF THE BORDER AND ARE SPENT IN PROJECTS FOR EXAMPLE JUST IN THE IN THE RIVER FOR EXAMPLE THERE WAS. OVER A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ABOUT TWENTY OF THOSE MILLION DOLLARS WERE SPENT. ON THE MEXICO SIDE AND OTHERS A CONTRIBUTED FROM CALIFORNIA. YET IT'S STILL THE REMAINS ABOUT EIGHTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS JUST TO SOLVE THAT PROBLEM. WELL CALIFORNIA AIMS TO CONTINUE TO GROW AND MAINTAIN AN EVER INCREASING ECONOMY. WE SHOULD BE AWARE THAT. THERE IS A PRICE TO PAY WE SHOULD NEVER DISREGARD OUR ENVIRONMENT AND SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITIES. THIS IS WHY WE BELIEVE THAT ESTABLISH AN INCREASING PRESENCE IN OVERSIGHT OVER THE BORDER REGION IS AN IMPORTANT MECHANISM. WE ARE AT THE BELIEVE THAT THE BORDER UNIT A BORDER UNIT FROM THE STATE TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT GUIDANCE ENFORCEMENT WILL BE AN IMPORTANT FACTOR MOVING FORWARD. WITH OUR BI NATIONAL-RELATIONSHIP. WHILE NOT ALL WELCOME SUCH AN INSTITUTION IT MAY WELL PROVIDE NEW AVENUES TO MAKE CALIFORNIA MEXICO AN EXAMPLE OF A HEALTHY AND SOCIALLY CONSCIENCE ECONOMY. GROWING A BI NATIONAL ECONOMY. IS ALSO SHARING A BI NATIONAL RESOURCES AND BI NATIONAL BURDENS THE NEW RIVER WHICH TRAVELS NORTH AT A RATE OF TWO FEET PER SECOND. IT MAKES THE GALLEY TO CALEXICO FROM MEXICO TO CALEXICO BRINGING WASTE WATER INTO THE US REPRESENTS A MAJOR ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERN AT THE BORDER. THOSE OF US WHO LIVE AT THE BORDER. YOU KNOW WHEN WE HEAR THE NATIONAL DISCUSSIONS ABOUT -- WHICH IS A REALITY YOU KNOW THERE IS A LEGAL AND ILLICIT TRADE -- BOWL IS HUMAN WHETHER IT'S DRUGS WE UNDERSTAND THAT'S A PROBLEM BUT THE NEW RIVER TRANSPORTS AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF THE ILLEGAL IMPORTATION OF HAZARDOUS WASTE SEWAGE WASTE COMING INTO A BORDER YET WE IGNORED AS THOUGH. IT'S OKAY TO TURN A BLIND EYE ON ONE THE ILLEGAL PROBLEM BUT BUT TURNED -- BUT FOCUS ON ANOTHER ONE FOR US IT'S A REALITY IT'S THERE AND IT'S AFFECTING PUBLIC HEALTH -- THE SOLVENCY ALSO EXTENDS FROM THE COACHELLA VALLEY. WHICH IS ALSO PART OF THE BORDER REGION INTO THE IMPERIAL VALLEY AND TO MAKE TO KELLY. WE SHARE THE AIR BASE IN AND WE SHARE THE AIR BEING THE LARGEST LAKE IN CALIFORNIA WHICH IS HAS HIGHER SALINITY. THEN THE OCEAN. AS A LAKE EVAPORATES ELISE BEHIND DUST CONTAINING HAVE HAZARDOUS POLLUTANTS SUCH AS SELENIUM ARSENIC AND TRACES OF PESTICIDES. THIS HAS ALSO SERVED AS A SOME FOR AGRICULTURE AND THE REASON WHY WE HAVE THIS SIZE AND THE SETTLEMENT PARTICULATES ARE. ARE PICKED UP BY THE WINDS AND CAN BE CARRIED OVER HUNDREDS OF MILES. HAVING THESE UNDER RESOURCE COMMUNITY SUFFER FROM RESPIRATORY PROBLEMS AND CARDIOVASCULAR. DISEASES. AS WE FACE A BORDER ENVIRONMENTAL CRISIS WITH THE LOOMING SONG SEE DEVASTATION. AND CROSS BORDER POLLUTION THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY SHOULD BE THE UTMOST PRIORITY. STUDENTS THAT LIVE IN THE CALIFORNIA MEXICO BORDER REGION ARE SUFFERING FROM AN ILLNESS SUCH AS ASTHMA AND OTHER RESPIRATORY CONDITIONS THAT REQUIRE A CONSTANT AND MINISTRATION A MEDICATION. DURING SCHOOL HOURS AND LIMITED NOT AN A. B. LIMITED IF NOT DENIED BY. TO ADMINISTER ANY MEDICATION GIVEN. BY OUT OF STATE HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS. WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS THAT THERE ARE HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS LICENSE BY CALIFORNIA? THAT ARE DOING BUSINESS IN THESE HYBRID TYPE OF PLANS YET. WHENEVER THEY BRING THE MEDICATION INTO. THE SCHOOLS THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED TO ADMINISTER THAT AND THAT DOES NOT MAKE ANY SENSE AND THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY CALL ME THEY SEE BECAUSE I IT. IS IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB SEVEN FORTY THREE WHICH WILL PROMOTING HEALTH EQUITY FOR CHILDREN IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND REQUIRES A SCHOOL DISTRICT TO ACCEPT A WRITTEN STATEMENT FROM A PHYSICIAN OR SURGEON WHO IS. CONTRACTED WITH BI NATIONAL HEALTH PLAN WHICH IS LICENSE IN CALIFORNIA FOR THE PURPOSES OF AUTHORIZING STUDENTS. OR PEOPLE'S TO BE ASSISTED BY SCHOOL NURSE OR OTHER DESIGNATED SCHOOL PERSONNEL AND TO BE ABLE TO CARRY A SEVEN MINISTER AND HELD ASTHMA MEDICATION MANY THIS KIDS CARRY THEIR ASTHMA MEDICATION AS A WAS CONTRABAND. AND YOU KNOW WHEN I HEARD THAT IT WAS THE UNITED STATES THIS MORNING. IT IS NECESSARY FOR OUR REGION TO ENSURE AN INCREASE OF AYE NATIONAL FORSMAN OF REGULATIONS TO ADDRESS THESE ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL CONCERNS. ASKED PRACTICES OF BOTH SIDES OF THE BORDER. AND THAT AFFECT OUR COMMUNITY AND JUST AS OUR BI NATIONAL ECONOMY THERE IS NO DIVIDING LINE POLLUTION KNOWS NO BORDER. AN IMPACT IN THE REGION AS A WHOLE THE STATE SHOULD BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT AND GUIDANCE. FROM ITS PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE DEALING WITH SIMILAR ISSUES IN MAY HE GO. ONE ONE SUCH ISSUE. IS -- IN THE TO FOLLOW THROUGH IN THE PLANNING OF IMPLEMENTING SOLUTIONS A LONG TERM PLANNING. THERE IS A MOVEMENT IN MAKES YOU KELLY THAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING WORK FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS IN THE BORDER REGION. pTWO THOUSANDS WE DID A SURVEY OUT THERE IN MAY HE KILEY WAS MORE CONCERNED ABOUT CONSERVATION. BUT AS THEIR RESOURCES HAVE RECENTLY BEEN THREATENING WE HAVE SEEN A MOVEMENT A SEARCH OF CITIZEN MOVEMENT THAT WANT TO DO LONG RANGE PLANNING. THEY ARE THE ONE I WANT TO JUST BE SUBJECT TO POLITICAL TERMS THEY DON'T WANT TO HIT THE RESET BUTTON EVERY TIME ADJOURNMENTS THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO DO LONG TERM PLANNING AND THAT IS MADE UP OF ACADEMIA. A PROFESSIONALS OF COMMUNITY -- BUSINESS -- AND SO EVEN RECENTLY THE TWO UNIVERSITIES DOWN THERE IS -- THE DECK AND AND WHILE THE SAVER EITHER SIGN IN PAYMENTS WITH US WE KNOW THEY'RE EAGER TO BE PART OF THE DISCUSSION THERE EAGER. TO BE CONVENERS NEUTRAL COMMUTERS TO BRING BOTH SIDES OF THE BORDER TOGETHER -- CALIFORNIA SHOULD ALSO SEEK TO SUPPORT MAY GOING PROVIDING TRAINING AND OPPORTUNITIES TO ADDRESS ALL THE PREVIOUS ISSUES MENTION AND IN THIS TESTIMONY. WE ARE AT THE CROSSROADS FOR HELPING OUR SISTER COMMUNITIES TO THE SOUTH WILL LEAD LONG TERM BENEFITS FOR ALL OF US -- FINALLY -- THE STATE GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO CREATE MORE OFFICES TO MOVE THOSE EXISTING.

THIS IS A I HAVE BEEN A MEMBER OF THE FEDERAL ADVISORY OARD THE GOOD NEIGHBOR ENVIRONMENTAL BOARD I'M VERY FAMILIAR. WITH A LOT OF THIS PLANNING AND AND AND A LOT OF THE RECOMMENDATION I BE PUT NOT ONLY BY MYSELF BUT BUT MANY EXPERTS -- THROUGHOUT THE YEARS AND AND YOU KNOW YOU CAN LOOK AT THOSE YOU CAN LOOK UP OR TWENTY TWENTY OR TWENTY TWELVE THE BI NATIONAL TASK FORCES I HAVE BEEN PART OF THAT FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS. AND IT SEEMS LIKE EVERY TIME GOVERNMENT IS GIVING AND I'M TALKING ABOUT CALIFORNIA. EVERY TIME CALIFORNIA'S GIVEN DIRECTION TO PUT A PLAN TOGETHER IT'S ALWAYS SORT OF A COPY PASTE I REVISITED THE SAME THING I THINK MEXICO AND HOW CALIFORNIA. IS IS IN A A YOU KNOW THEIR IN A DIFFERENT POSITION THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN BEFORE I THINK THERE'S A LOT MORE MOMENTUM THERE'S A LOT OF PROFESSIONALS. IN AREAS LIKE THE BORDER IT IN I CAN SAY MORE PROBABLY MORE DEFINITELY THE FINE AND IMPERIAL MEXICALI AND I'M PRETTY SURE THIS. AND SAN DIEGO A LOT OF WE DROP A LOT OF PROFESSIONS MONEY GUY BECAUSE THEY HAVE PUT THE EFFORT IN AN EMPHASIS ON CREATING A AN EDUCATED POPULATION. SO WE HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER TO BE ABLE TO CREATE SOLUTIONS TOGETHER THERE ARE RESOURCES IN CALIFORNIA THERE'S EXPERTS IN MAY HE KILEY AND I THINK THAT THE NEW ADMINISTRATION RIGHT NOW ON BOTH SIDES WHETHER IT'S CALIFORNIA. OR OR MAY HE GO A REALLY CONDUCIVE TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT I WOULD HOPE THAT THROUGH THIS HEARING THAT THERE IS A A PLAN. I AND IN IN A PATHWAY TO BE ABLE TO MODERNIZE THE WAY WE DO BUSINESS -- INTO MY THAT POINTS REAL QUICK IS THAT THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD TO TAKE A LEAD AND THEY ACTUALLY THE BOARD -- APPROVED THE CREATION OF A BORDER PROGRAM -- AND AND THAT WAS AS A RESULT OF BECAUSE THEY HAD PREVIOUSLY HAD -- DEPLOYED SOME OF THEIR STAFF THEY DID BUSINESS AS USUAL THEY LISTEN TO US AND THEN THEY SAID YEAH WE AGREE WE GOT TO DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY THERE'S A NEW ADMINISTRATION NOW. THEY WANT TO AND FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND THEY THEY WANT TO BRING AN ENTIRE MORE COMPREHENSIVE MOTOR PROGRAM SO WE HOPE THAT THIS IS A TREND THAT WE CONTINUE TO TAKE OPPORTUNITY AND AND BE ABLE -- TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE ENTHUSIASM TO THE BANK KILEY I'VE LIVED IN THE BORDER I HAVE WORKED ON BORDER ISSUES FOR TWENTY YEARS AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I SEE THIS MONO MOMENTUM AND I WANT TO THANK.

WE WANT TO SUPPORT SMART CLEAN SAFE AND INCLUSIVE COMMUNITIES IN OUR REGION SOCIAL JUSTICE IS A KEY PRINCIPLE IN ALL ASPECTS OF THE NEW. NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN AND HERE'S AN EXAMPLE PERTINENT TO THE CLEAN ENERGY SECTOR AND I QUOTE. THE NEW ENERGY POLICY OF THE MEXICAN STATE WILL BE TO PROMOTE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT THROUGH THE INCORPORATION OF POPULATION. I COMMUNITIES IN ENERGY PRODUCTION FROM RENEWABLE SOURCES WHICH IN TURN WILL FUNDAMENTALLY WILL BE FUNDAMENTAL TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE ELECTRICITY TO THE SMALL AND REMOTE COMMUNITIES THE STILL DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO EAT AND THAT AMOUNT TO APPROXIMATELY. TWO MILLION INHABITANTS THE ENERGY TRANSITION WILL SERVE AS A BASIS FOR TWO FULL FOSTER THE EMERGENCE OF SOCIAL OF THE SOCIAL SECTOR IN THIS AREA. AS WELL AS TWO FOR MEN THEY YOU R INDUSTRIALIZATION OF THE COUNTRY END OF QUOTE. I BELIEVE CALIFORNIA. I NEEDS DYNAMIC ECONOMY. WITH ITS INNOVATIVE CLEAN TECH INDUSTRY AS WELL AS THE WEALTH OF STATE POLLS YOU KNOW HOW ON CLIMATE ACTION AND INVESTMENT TO SPUR LOW CARBON DEVELOPMENT CAN ASSIST THE PARTNER.

THANK YOU FOR THIS OF THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU [inaudible] FOR SCHERING. BUT LOTS OF GOOD INFORMATION LESS AND I WANNA BEGIN BY THANKING ALL THE ALL THE PANELISTS OR CONTRIBUTED TO THIS EFFORT. DID THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WANT TO MAKE ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS OR SIR BRADFORD AYE I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU CHAIRMAN FOR CONVENING THIS HEARING AND I THINK IF IT'S ONE TAKE AWAY WE'LL. AND ALL UNDERSTAND THAT WE HAVE FAR MORE. IN COMMON WITH MEXICO THAN WE HAVE DIFFERENCES AND I THINK IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT WE AS CALIFORNIANS SHOW THE LEAD AS IT RELATES TO THE ECONOMY AND THE ENVIRONMENT. AND ABD AND SHOW WHAT DIRECT IMPACT IT HAS ON BOTH COUNTRIES BECAUSE IN MANY WAYS WERE ONE COUNTRY -- DESPITE MUCH OF OUR DIFFERENCES WE HAVE BEEN -- INTERDEPENDENCY THAT'S FAR BEYOND JUST. THE PEOPLE THAT CROSS THE BORDER SO I THANK YOU FOR THIS I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE GOVERNMENT AND THE INSTITUTIONS OF THEIR AND HIGHER EDUCATION ALSO IN ADDRESSING. THESE CONCERNS AND THESE ISSUES THAT AGAIN IMPACT BOTH COUNTRIES TREMENDOUSLY SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP. THANK CENTER AROUND WHY DOES THE I'D LOVE TO BUY ONE OF THESE I WANT TO ASK ABOUT A MAYBE DOCTOR STARRED OCCURS YEARLY. I THE LAST TIME I WAS IN MEXICO WE TRAVEL TOGETHER I IT WAS DURING THE TWENTY SIXTEEN SUMMER. TWENTY SIXTEEN I AND SO I HAVEN'T BEEN IN MEXICO SINCE A DOG JUMP SELECT A PRESIDENT. IT'S INTERESTING TO HEAR THE YOU KNOW WHEN WE WERE THERE. PEOPLE WERE VERY VERY WORRIED ABOUT -- HIS CANDIDACY IN COURSE WE SPENT ALL TIME SAYING THAT DOG DOOR IS NOT GOING TO WIN -- NEVER THINGS CAN BE JUST FINE AND AND SO. REALLY I MEAN I WAS THAT WAS KIND OF A MESSAGE ON NATIONAL ABOUT EARLY IN RETROSPECT BUT YOU KNOW LOVE TO HEAR YOU OBVIOUSLY AFTER THE INITIAL. REACTION THERE SEEMS TO BE A CERTAIN COMING TO TERMS MAYBE I'M A LOT OF AMERICANS ARE ARE IN THE SAME BOAT. AB I LOVE TO GET SOME INSIGHTS INTO THE CURRENT POLITICAL CLIMATE AS IT RELATES TO THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY HOW HE'S VIEWED HOW THE HOW HOW THINGS HAVE EVOLVED OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS -- AND AND HOW THAT'S MAY BE REFLECTED BY THE ELECTION RESULTS BUT I I KNOW OUR EXPERTS ARE HERE LET ME START MADE SOME COMMENTS REGARDING THAT I THINK THEY WERE THEY WERE GOOD IN TERMS OF HER ANALYSIS OF MEXICO'S POLITICAL POSITIONS WITH THIS ADMINISTRATION BUT IF YOU WANT EXPAND. COM UM I MEAN PUBLIC OPINION OF OF OF OF OF TRUMP IN MEXICO IS EXTREMELY POOR I DON'T HAVE THE NUMBERS IN FRONT OF ME. BUT I WAS A POSITIVE OPINION OF HIM IS PROBABLY IN SINGLE DIGITS -- BUT AS I SAID IN MY COMMENTS MEXICAN SEPARATE OUT THEIR ATTITUDES TOWARD PRESIDENT TRUMP FROM THEIR ATTITUDES TOWARDS UNITED STATES. SENATORS TOWARDS UNITED STATES ACTUALLY STILL QUITE STRONG. I'M IN THERE STILL IS A STRONG -- SUPPORT FOR THE NORTH AMERICAN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT. AND THEIR STRONG SUPPORT FOR AWHILE WILL MEXICANS ARE VERY CRITICAL OF PRESIDENT BEEN AND YET THE FOR NOT RESPONDING. TO TRUMP'S PROVOCATIONS THEY SEEM TO HAVE TURNED -- THEIR ATTITUDE SIGNIFICANTLY AT OUR BACKING LOPEZ OBRADOR'S STRATEGY OF SIMPLY NOT RESPONDING -- THERE SEEMS TO BE THIS THE GENERAL ATTITUDE THAT -- IF YOU NOTICE WANTS TO BUILD A WALL WHATEVER BUILD A WALL. OF BOUGHT -- WHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO OF THEM TO DEAL WITH UNITED STATES IS TO NOT CONFRONT PROP TRUMP AND NOT BECAUSE ADDITIONAL PROBLEMS WITH THEM BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT THE NEXT WEEK IT'S GOING TO BE? ONE TWEET AS I LEFT MEXICO ON THE NEXT STREET IS MEXICO'S THE CAUSE OF ALL OF OUR PROBLEMS. SO IN GENERAL THERE'S IS AS BROAD ATTITUDE OF JUST NOT DEALING WITH HIM AND LETTING HIM THEIR SPIN HIMSELF. ALLEN ANY IN IS THAT THAT'S SORT OF THAT THAT THERE IS THAT'S AN EVOLUTION OF SORTS FROM THE BEGINNING FROM FOR WHEN HE WAS FIRST ELECTED. WHEN TROUBLES A SELECTION YEAH OF THERE WAS A LOT OF CRITICISM OF PRESIDENT BEEN AND YET THE FOR NOT STANDING UP MORE STRONGLY TO TRUMP? AND THERE WAS A BELIEF THAT LOPEZ OBRADOR WAS ACTUALLY GOING TO BE MORE FORCEFUL ANY ACTUALLY PUBLISHED A BOOK DURING THE CAMPAIGN CALLED OR YET TRUMP. AND WHICH HE CRITICIZED US POLICY AGGRESSIVELY AND THERE WAS THE ASSUMPTION THAT THERE WAS GOING TO BE A LARGE CLASH BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM -- BUT WHEN LOCUSTS OVER THE WAR HAD TO DECIDE DID HE WANT TO SPEND HIS TIME CONFRONTING UNITED STATES OR CONFRONTING THE ECONOMIC PROBLEMS THAT HE SEES IN MEXICO HE CHOSE THE LATTER. AND I THINK PART OF IT IS BECAUSE HE'S SO DARN POPULAR HIS. HIS APPROVAL RATINGS ARE IN THE MID SEVENTIES -- THAT THE POPULATION IS GIVING HIM THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT BACKING HIM ON THIS POLICY ERIDGE NOW WE ARE WE ACTUALLY WANT A LISTING US RIGHT AFTER THE TRUMP MEETING AND WE HAD A CHANCE TO TALK. TO AND PRESIDENT BEING AT ABOUT IT WAS VERY INTERESTING READING ON'T. YOUR OTHER QUESTION WANT TO ASK YOU THERE'S BEEN AT AS WAS MENTIONED A KIND OF A EARTHQUAKE ELECTORALLY. IN A SIMILAR TO WHAT WE'VE SEEN WHEN FRANCE AND AND A COUPLE OTHER PLACES WHERE THE TRADITIONAL PARTY STRUCTURE HAS RUPTURED -- YOU HAVE THIS. YEAH BRAND NEW PARTY THAT IS SEEMINGLY COME OUT OF NOWHERE VERY CLOSE ASSOCIATE WITH THIS ONE PERSON. I'M CAN YOU CAN YOU GIVE US SOME INSIGHTS AS TO HOW WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT THE POLITICAL SCENE IN MEXICO RIGHT NOW IN THE WAKE OF THE ELECTIONS AND UNDERSTANDING THOSE RESULTS. SURE I MEAN THE THE RESULTS THEMSELVES A REFLECTION OF THE DISSATISFACTION THAT MEXICO'S FELT TOWARD TRADITIONAL POLITICAL PARTIES. WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THAT -- LOCUS OF A LOWER DID NOT CHANGE HIS OPINIONS AND THE MULTIPLE TIMES THAT HE RUN FOR PRESIDENT WHAT CHANGED WAS PUBLIC OPINION ATTITUDES TOWARD THE OPPOSITION AND THEREFORE TOWARD HIM. AND WE GOT TO ELECTION IN TWO TWENTY SIX IN IN IN IN IN -- TWENTY EIGHTEEN AGAIN MY YEARS RIGHT -- THAT -- LEVELS OF A LOWER WAS SEEN AS THE BEST OPTION AVAILABLE WE TRIED TO PUT THE THE BOND FOR FOR TWELVE YEARS. AND THEY HAD NO PROOF THING SIGNIFICANTLY INDEED THINGS THAT WE ECONOMY SEEM TO BE QUITE STAGNANT. WITHIN TRY THE PREVIEW PROMISED A INCREASE GROWTH IN WHAT THEY GAVE US WAS A DRAMATIC INCREASE IN CORRUPTION AND NO INCREASE IN GROWTH -- AND AND IN BOTH CASES SECURITY KEPT GETTING WORSE AND WORSE AND WORSE SO WHY NOT TRY THE OTHER OPTION WE HAVEN'T TRIED -- IN THERE WAS A LOT OF OF OF ABOUT 20% OF THE VOTE FOR OF VOTERS IN MEXICO WHICH IS. I'VE MOVED UP SOME OF THE OR FROM 3250% OF THE ELECTRICITY 3% HE WON SORT OF WERE IN THAT POSITIONOF WE'RE SO DISGUSTED WITH THE OTHER TWO PARTIES THAT WE'RE GONNA GIVE HIM A TRY YEAH -- AND THE OTHER TWO PARTIES HAVE IMPLODED TO A CERTAIN TO TRIP PORTENT AGREE THERE ARE THERE ARE THE PRE AND THE AND THE PIER DEAR SHADOWS OF WHICH THEY ONCE WERE. AND THE BOND IS ALSO QUITE WEAK SO THE SITUATION IN MEXICO NOW IS ONE OF A OF A A COUNTRY IN WHICH GIVE A VERY VERY POPULAR PRESIDENT TO CONTROLS BOTH HOUSES OF THE LEGISLATURE. AND DOESN'T HAVE A STRONG OPPOSITION THE DOESN'T CONTROL TWO THIRDS OF THE SENATE -- BUT THE UP THE THE OPPOSITION THAT IS THERE TO OPPOSE HIM IS IS QUITE WEAK -- AND SO HE IS A VERY STRONG PRESIDENT AS A RESULT. OR MY HOW QUESTION ALLIANCES MY ROOMMATE YOU HAVE MY FINAL QUESTION -- WHAT'S THE STATE OF PLAY OF DRUG LEGALIZATION -- THAT CONVERSATION IN MEXICO RIGHT NOW AND WE'RE OBVIOUSLY MOVING WONDER ACTION I WAS INITIALLY CAME UP IN A CONVERSATION WITH THE PRESIDENT. WHEN WE WERE DOWN THERE -- WHERE ATTITUDES WHERE YOU SEE THAT CONVERSATION MEXICO'S MOVING IN THE SAME DIRECTION? IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S A LITTLE BIT BEHIND THE UNITED STATES BUT% THERE WAS JUST A PROPOSAL. I AND I DON'T REMEMBER -- WHERE THE PROPOSAL WAS WHICH HAS THE LEGISLATURE THERE'S BEEN A PROPOSAL TO LEGALIZE MARIJUANA IN MEXICO? AND IN THE CONGRESS RIGHT NOW IT'S A I BELIEVE SO IS THAT RIGHT. YES EXACTLY YEAH YOU GET THE BY CHANCE AT THE NAY [inaudible] IS THERE. HAS BEEN RECOGNIZE HIS VISIT STRAIGHT LEGALIZATION YES THE YEAH.

SEVEN OBERNOLTE FROM UC BERKELEY -- THANK YOU CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS I JUST AND I REALLY LIKE THE PANELS THAT -- SPOKE TO PREVIOUSLY AND INCLUDED A COUPLE OF ACADEMICS.

I DON'T KNOW IF THE NUMBERS ARE EXACTLY RIGHT BUT PEOPLE SAY THE TIME IS TEN TIMES THE SIZE OF MEXICO BUT SENDS A HUNDRED TIMES AS MANY STUDENTS TO CALIFORNIA -- THEY ENRICH OUR ECONOMY THEY ENRICH OUR SOCIETY AND THEY CERTAINLY IMPROVE. A COLLABORATION WITH CHINA SOUTH ASIA SIMILARLY SENDS A LARGE NUMBER OF STUDENTS AND SILICON VALLEY BENEFITS FROM FROM THEIR BRAIN POWER. WE DON'T DO NEARLY ENOUGH WITH MEXICO AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT AS PART OF THIS OF AN INITIATIVE THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WE NEED TO SEND MORE CALIFORNIA STUDENTS TO MEXICO TO STUDY. AND WE TO BRING MORE MEXICAN STUDENTS TO CALIFORNIA TO STUDY AND WE NEED TO DO THAT CONNECTS FROM WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW. I THINK THAT'S TRUE OF THE UC SYSTEM BUT IT'S ALSO TRUE CAL STATE IT'S ALSO TRUE OF OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES. WE NEED A REAL EFFORT TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF FLOW BACK AND FORTH -- THAT IS ACADEMIC AND FOCUS ESPECIALLY ON THE ENTREPRENEURIAL SIDE NOW WE WANT TO GET STUDENTS WHO ARE HAVING NOT JUST ACADEMIC BUT ALSO WORK EXPERIENCES ON BOTH SIDES OF THE BORDER.
