00:44:38.809 --> 00:44:40.844
THIS IN FACT THE MAIN THRUST OF

00:44:40.911 --> 00:44:43.147
EACH OF THE AGENCIES IS NOT

00:44:43.213 --> 00:44:45.549
INSIDE INNOVATION I MEAN WITH

00:44:45.616 --> 00:44:46.817
LIKE INSIGHTS AND INNOVATION-

00:44:46.884 --> 00:44:49.186
BUT IT REALLY ISN'T OUT.

00:44:49.253 --> 00:44:53.624
PRIVACY AND PROTECTION AND

00:44:53.690 --> 00:44:56.026
ASSURING THAT PEOPLE YOU KNOW

00:44:56.093 --> 00:44:57.728
THAT THAT THAT'S NO PATIENT

00:44:57.795 --> 00:45:00.064
PROTECTION I MEAN THOSE TYPES

00:45:00.130 --> 00:45:01.965
OF THINGS YET THAT AND I DON'T

00:45:02.032 --> 00:45:04.701
AYE ENTITLES DO YOU KNOW IF

00:45:04.768 --> 00:45:06.403
YOUR WORK AND AGENCIES IN THE

00:45:06.470 --> 00:45:07.771
TITLE OF YOUR AGENCIES ACCESS

00:45:07.838 --> 00:45:10.474
THAT. THE FIGHT HELP CERTAINLY

00:45:10.541 --> 00:45:11.909
ONE ELEMENT TO HELP TO FIND THE

00:45:11.975 --> 00:45:15.212
CULTURE AND SEE. SO I MEAN I

00:45:15.279 --> 00:45:18.382
SEE CERTAIN BODY BEING A CENTER

00:45:18.449 --> 00:45:19.683
FOR DATE INSIGHTS INNOVATION IF

00:45:19.750 --> 00:45:21.518
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO CRUNCH THESE

00:45:21.585 --> 00:45:23.520
AND FIND OUT CERTAIN PATTERNS

00:45:23.587 --> 00:45:25.589
AND SO FORTH. BUT I WOULD THINK

00:45:25.656 --> 00:45:27.825
THIS. ENTER KEY GIVEN THE

00:45:27.891 --> 00:45:29.359
AGENCIES THAT WE COMBINE TO

00:45:29.426 --> 00:45:31.061
FORM THIS SHOULD BE TALKING

00:45:31.128 --> 00:45:34.198
ABOUT. INTEGRITY AND PRIVACY

00:45:34.264 --> 00:45:36.567
AND SECURITY NOT INNOVATION AND

00:45:36.633 --> 00:45:37.901
INSIGHTS I MEAN NOT SEEN THAT

00:45:37.968 --> 00:45:40.537
THEY SHOULDN'T DO THAT BUT BUT

00:45:40.604 --> 00:45:43.607
THAT THAT SHOULD BE THERE IN

00:45:43.674 --> 00:45:44.241
THAT SHOULD. RIGHT THAT SHOULD

00:45:44.308 --> 00:45:45.142
BE THEIR MAIN THE PEOPLE GO TO

00:45:45.209 --> 00:45:47.144
WORK THERE'S- A STICKY PEOPLE

00:45:47.211 --> 00:45:48.946
PROTECTOR DATA RIGHT BE SURE

00:45:49.012 --> 00:45:50.581
THAT THEIR PRIVACY IS PROTECTED

00:45:50.647 --> 00:45:52.449
BECAUSE WE HAVE DIFFERENT ALL

00:45:52.516 --> 00:45:54.852
THE MULTIPLE LAWS RAIDS YOU

00:45:54.918 --> 00:45:55.552
MENTIONED RIGHT. THAT FOR OUR

00:45:55.619 --> 00:45:57.354
JOB IS TO BE FOR PATIENTS WHAT

00:45:57.421 --> 00:45:59.590
THEY HAVE COMPLIANCE- LEVERED

00:45:59.656 --> 00:46:01.758
AT- WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING

00:46:01.825 --> 00:46:03.694
AT THE PATTERNS O BE SURE THAT

00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:04.328
THE AND THAT THAT WERE DRESSING

00:46:04.394 --> 00:46:06.330
THE ISSUES THAT PATIENTS ARE

00:46:06.396 --> 00:46:07.297
RAPING WITH. PLAN ARE TYPES OF

00:46:07.364 --> 00:46:13.237
THINGS RIGHT. STATION THAT. FOR

00:46:13.303 --> 00:46:14.304
WELL IT OLD OFFICE HELD IN.

00:46:14.371 --> 00:46:16.507
INTEGRITY RIGHT. SO AGAIN I

00:46:16.573 --> 00:46:18.075
SORT OF FEEL LIKE WE'VE LOST

00:46:18.142 --> 00:46:19.776
THE PURPOSES OF THE THREE

00:46:19.843 --> 00:46:21.111
AGENCIES THAT WE PUT TOGETHER

00:46:21.178 --> 00:46:22.946
EVEN IN THE TITLE SO CAN YOU.

00:46:23.013 --> 00:46:25.215
TALK TO ME ABOUT THAT ONE

00:46:25.282 --> 00:46:28.752
ABSOLUTELY. SO BE THERE'S SORT

00:46:28.819 --> 00:46:30.154
OF A SHORT TERM. NEED FOR

00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:33.023
EVOLUTION AND- SOME BUILDING

00:46:33.090 --> 00:46:34.525
AND THEN A LONG TERM VISION FOR

00:46:34.591 --> 00:46:36.026
WHERE WE WANT TO GO AND THE

00:46:36.093 --> 00:46:37.694
TITLE REALLY REFLECTS MORE OF A

00:46:37.761 --> 00:46:39.229
LONG TERM VISION OF WHERE WE

00:46:39.296 --> 00:46:40.697
WANT TO GO. BEFORE YOU CAN

00:46:40.764 --> 00:46:42.166
REALLY START DOING SOME OF THE

00:46:42.232 --> 00:46:43.267
THINGS THAT YOU MENTIONED AS

00:46:43.333 --> 00:46:45.669
WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT WITH THAT

00:46:45.736 --> 00:46:47.905
TITLE. RELEASE START WITH THE

00:46:47.971 --> 00:46:49.039
MEN AND WOMEN'S AND SORT OF

00:46:49.106 --> 00:46:50.674
STANDARDIZED THAT THROUGHOUT

00:46:50.741 --> 00:46:51.808
THE ENTIRE HEALTH AND HUMAN

00:46:51.875 --> 00:46:53.544
SERVICES AGENCY. THEN ONCE WE

00:46:53.610 --> 00:46:56.547
SET. RULES AROUND WHAT

00:46:56.613 --> 00:46:58.081
COLLECTION LOOKS LIKE DATA

00:46:58.148 --> 00:47:00.918
DICTIONARY- ALL THOSE PIECES.

00:47:00.984 --> 00:47:02.753
ONCE WE UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER'S

00:47:02.819 --> 00:47:04.121
DATA WHAT IT MEANS WILL HAVE A

00:47:04.188 --> 00:47:05.923
BETTER OPPORTUNITY OF. TAKING

00:47:05.989 --> 00:47:08.158
USE CASES AND COMPARING APPLES

00:47:08.225 --> 00:47:09.760
TO APPLES INSTEAD OF APPLES TO

00:47:09.826 --> 00:47:11.628
ORANGES. AND THEY'D BE ABLE TO

00:47:11.695 --> 00:47:13.030
LOOK THROUGH THAT. AND DO THAT

00:47:13.096 --> 00:47:15.032
KIND OF ANALYTICAL WORK. SO

00:47:15.098 --> 00:47:17.734
THERE. WE ARE LOOKING TO SEE

00:47:17.801 --> 00:47:19.269
WHAT WE CAN DO WITH RESPECT TO

00:47:19.336 --> 00:47:21.438
YOU. HOW WE CAN BETTER USE OUR

00:47:21.505 --> 00:47:23.507
DATA AND BETTER INFORMED THE

00:47:23.574 --> 00:47:24.575
DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE USING

00:47:24.641 --> 00:47:26.176
THEIR DATA ON HOW TO MAKE THEIR

00:47:26.243 --> 00:47:27.477
PROGRAMS MORE EFFECTIVE AND

00:47:27.544 --> 00:47:29.580
IMPROVE SERVICES. SO ONE OF THE

00:47:29.646 --> 00:47:32.816
VISION THAT WE HAVE ISSUE. TO

00:47:32.883 --> 00:47:34.351
MOVE THIS TOWARDS. PULLING THAT

00:47:34.418 --> 00:47:35.719
INFORMATION FROM AN AGENCY

00:47:35.786 --> 00:47:37.654
PERSPECTIVE SO FOR EXAMPLE.

00:47:37.721 --> 00:47:39.189
DEPARTMENTS ARE AWARE OF WHO AT

00:47:39.256 --> 00:47:40.657
WHO'S AT HIGHER RISK WITHIN

00:47:40.724 --> 00:47:42.759
THEIR OWN DEPARTMENT. BUT AS AN

00:47:42.826 --> 00:47:44.361
AGENCY WE'RE NOT ENTIRELY SURE

00:47:44.428 --> 00:47:46.096
WHO'S AT HIGHER RISK WITHIN. AS

00:47:46.163 --> 00:47:50.067
IN. E. PERSPECTIVE OVER THE

00:47:50.133 --> 00:47:52.970
SCOPE OF ALL OF OUR PROGRAM.

00:47:53.036 --> 00:47:54.938
AND SO. A BETTER UNDERSTANDING

00:47:55.005 --> 00:47:56.640
AND WILL PROBABLY HAVE IT BASED

00:47:56.707 --> 00:47:59.509
ON SOME USE CASES. WHO IS AT

00:47:59.576 --> 00:48:00.811
RISK THROUGHOUT ALL OF THE

00:48:00.877 --> 00:48:02.045
PROGRAMS IN A MORE HOLISTIC

00:48:02.112 --> 00:48:04.281
RISK RESPONSE. SO THAT WE CAN

00:48:04.348 --> 00:48:05.349
REPORT BACK TO THOSE

00:48:05.415 --> 00:48:06.450
DEPARTMENTS AND PROVIDE BETTER

00:48:06.516 --> 00:48:08.352
SERVICES LOOK TO SEE WHICH

00:48:08.418 --> 00:48:10.287
POPULATIONS ARE UNDERSERVED

00:48:10.354 --> 00:48:11.788
WHICH RESOURCES NEED TO BE

00:48:11.855 --> 00:48:13.790
ADDED TO CERTAIN. PROGRAMS TO

00:48:13.857 --> 00:48:15.659
HELP SERVE THOSE FOLKS ADD TO

00:48:15.726 --> 00:48:16.660
BETTER YOU KNOW PROVIDE

00:48:16.727 --> 00:48:18.328
EFFICACY AND EFFICIENCY

00:48:18.395 --> 00:48:20.097
THROUGHOUT. AND ALSO AS

00:48:20.163 --> 00:48:21.098
JENNIFER MENTIONED HEALTH AND

00:48:21.164 --> 00:48:22.466
HUMAN SERVICES DATED THAT'S

00:48:22.532 --> 00:48:24.268
DATA RICH WHEN WE HAVE A LOT OF

00:48:24.334 --> 00:48:25.002
DATA ACROSS ALL THE

00:48:25.068 --> 00:48:26.169
DEPARTMENTS. AND ONE OF THE

00:48:26.236 --> 00:48:28.672
VISION THAT IN THE FUTURE AN

00:48:28.739 --> 00:48:29.706
ANALYST IN ONE OF THE

00:48:29.773 --> 00:48:31.608
DEPARTMENTS CAN TAP INTO OUR

00:48:31.675 --> 00:48:33.143
DATA AND SOME TYPE OF THE

00:48:33.210 --> 00:48:37.414
PORTAL OR SEARCH DATA. AND MAKE

00:48:37.481 --> 00:48:42.119
IT INTO ASSISTANCE IT THAT'S

00:48:42.185 --> 00:48:43.954
ONE TERM. WELL WE TAKE OUR

00:48:44.021 --> 00:48:44.521
HOUSE AND TAKE CARE OF THE

00:48:44.588 --> 00:48:45.722
POLICY ISSUES OF THE WORK. WE

00:48:45.789 --> 00:48:49.826
DO. DOING WELL BUT EXT AND- SO

00:48:49.893 --> 00:48:50.761
IT'S A LOT TERM VISION WHICH

00:48:50.827 --> 00:48:52.062
WOULD LEAD TO THE NEED. THE NEW

00:48:52.129 --> 00:48:57.334
NAME A NEW BRANDING OKAY SO.

00:48:57.401 --> 00:48:58.902
BUT I'M GONNA BECAUSE THIS COST.

00:48:58.969 --> 00:49:00.937
OKAY SO OF THE GUY. RIGHT

00:49:01.004 --> 00:49:01.705
NINETEEN NINETY HEALTH SERVICES.

00:49:01.772 --> 00:49:03.874
FOR FACT CD. I ALSO EVEN IN

00:49:03.940 --> 00:49:05.375
LEGISLATURE I AUTHOR BUILD OPEN

00:49:05.442 --> 00:49:08.545
DATA RIGHT SO I AM A BIG

00:49:08.612 --> 00:49:10.747
BELIEVER IN THE POWER OF DATA I

00:49:10.814 --> 00:49:13.583
ALSO- THE QUESTION I HAVE IS

00:49:13.650 --> 00:49:17.020
THAT- LEAST CERTAINLY. NEED AND

00:49:17.087 --> 00:49:18.288
CAN USE FOR BASED ON YOUR

00:49:18.355 --> 00:49:19.956
EXPLANATION I AGREE THAT WE

00:49:20.023 --> 00:49:21.992
COULD USE AND A CENTER FOR DATA

00:49:22.059 --> 00:49:23.193
INSIGHTS AND INNOVATION DATE

00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:24.695
THAT I POINTED OUT THAT'S NOT

00:49:24.761 --> 00:49:26.863
THAT'S NOT IN QUESTION THAT WE

00:49:26.930 --> 00:49:27.864
SHOULD NOT WE HAVE A LOT OF

00:49:27.931 --> 00:49:29.599
DATA. WE SHOULD MAKE IT

00:49:29.666 --> 00:49:31.201
AVAILABLE WE ARE ANALYTICAL

00:49:31.268 --> 00:49:33.136
CAPACITY TO ANALYZE THE DATA

00:49:33.203 --> 00:49:35.205
WITHIN THE STATE IS PROBABLY IT

00:49:35.272 --> 00:49:36.540
DOWN GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF DATA

00:49:36.606 --> 00:49:39.109
WE HAVE IS. IT YOU KNOW COULD

00:49:39.176 --> 00:49:39.843
BE EXPANDED I THINK THERE'S

00:49:39.910 --> 00:49:43.146
ALSO- AND WHAT IS THAT AGAIN

00:49:43.213 --> 00:49:49.753

THAT IS SO THAT IT'S NOT ONLY

00:49:57.461 --> 00:49:59.730
THE STATE BUT OTHERS CAN CAN

00:49:59.796 --> 00:50:01.998

INDIVIDUALS AND SO FORTH. MY

00:50:08.572 --> 00:50:10.574
QUESTION IS THAT THE AGENCIES

00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:11.708
THAT WE PUT TOGETHER AND

00:50:11.775 --> 00:50:13.110
CERTAINLY YOU KNOW THEY HAVE

00:50:13.176 --> 00:50:15.645
HALF TO THEY HAVE SOME-

00:50:15.712 --> 00:50:17.647
INSIGHTS IN THIS BUT THEY THESE

00:50:17.714 --> 00:50:20.016
FUNCTIONS. HE IS ALMOST THE

00:50:20.083 --> 00:50:22.219
COUNTER BALANCE OKAY SO YES WE

00:50:22.285 --> 00:50:23.720
HAVE ONE AGENCY THAT'S FIGURE

00:50:23.787 --> 00:50:25.555
HOW HE PUSHED IT OUT BUT I ALSO

00:50:25.622 --> 00:50:27.791
WANT AN AGENCY THAT'S AS- YOU

WHICH OBVIOUSLY WAS THE FOR THE

00:54:17.220 --> 00:54:18.455
RIGHT REASONS AND RATING. AND

00:54:18.521 --> 00:54:20.190
ASSUME THAT. BUT YET BECAUSE

00:54:20.256 --> 00:54:23.159
THE PROBLEM. THEN WE HAVE A

00:54:23.226 --> 00:54:23.960
THEN WE HAVE A BIGGER PROBLEM

00:54:24.027 --> 00:54:25.895
OUR HANDS RATE AND SO I WOULD

HAVE THE RIGHT BALANCE. THERE

00:54:33.370 --> 00:54:35.505
SO THAT TO THE RIGHT DECISIONS

00:54:35.572 --> 00:54:36.573
ARE MADE BY THE PEOPLE WHO

00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:38.608
FINALLY MAKE POLICY DECISIONS.

00:54:38.675 --> 00:54:40.410
SO TO KIND OF SPEAK A LITTLE

00:54:40.477 --> 00:54:41.711
BIT TO THAT AND I'M HOPING THAT

00:54:41.778 --> 00:54:43.213
THIS WILL HELP. PROVIDE A

00:54:43.279 --> 00:54:46.950
LITTLE BIT MORE- RETURNS- OF

00:54:47.017 --> 00:54:48.918

SETTING THE RULES AROUND IT.

00:54:58.762 --> 00:55:00.830
AND TO BE VERY VERY CLEAR THERE

00:55:00.897 --> 00:55:03.266
IS NO INTENTION HERE OF

00:55:03.333 --> 00:55:06.102

BACK YOU TRY THE IN THIS

00:55:11.508 --> 00:55:13.009
ACCIDENT. SO IT'S SORT OF OPEN

00:55:13.076 --> 00:55:14.310
THE FLOODGATES IN A LOT OF

00:55:14.377 --> 00:55:16.346
PROGRAMS UP HAVE A LOT OF

00:55:16.413 --> 00:55:18.214
SPECIAL RULES AROUND WHEN YOU

LET YOU KNOW THAT WERE. MORE

00:55:44.974 --> 00:55:46.109
NOT DOING THIS WITHOUT RULES

THAT THAT THEY WERE DOING THIS

00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:25.782
IN AN APPROPRIATE FASHION AND

00:56:25.849 --> 00:56:27.417
WE ABSOLUTELY WANT TO DO THIS

00:56:27.484 --> 00:56:29.085
IN AN APPROPRIATE FASHION WE DO

00:56:29.152 --> 00:56:31.121
NOT WANT TO LOSE THE PUBLIC

TRUST EITHER YEAH AND I KNOW

00:56:32.989 --> 00:56:36.126
THAT AND SO I GUESS. THE ONE OF

00:56:36.192 --> 00:56:39.062

RIGHT AT THAT I KNOW ALL YOUR-

00:56:50.106 --> 00:56:53.777

00:56:53.843 --> 00:56:55.345
THIS THAT THE FIRST STAB AT

00:56:55.411 --> 00:56:57.147
CULTURE IS THE TO RIGHT OF THE

00:56:57.213 --> 00:56:58.281

SAYS CAUTION RIGHT AND HOPEFUL

00:57:02.285 --> 00:57:03.319
WE SHOULD THINK THIS THROUGH

00:57:03.386 --> 00:57:07.290
BIT ABOUT DOCTOR STATE'S JUST

00:57:07.357 --> 00:57:11.828
DOWN TO. IN HELPING KASHA BUT

00:57:11.895 --> 00:57:15.098
CANCER OF THE REAL ISSUE BE.

00:57:15.165 --> 00:57:16.466
NOW THESE EIGHT THREE AGENCIES

00:57:16.533 --> 00:57:17.801
THAT WERE MERGING INTO THISHOW

00:57:17.867 --> 00:57:19.402
HOW THEY WILL THEN SIT IN THE

00:57:19.469 --> 00:57:20.804
OFFICE WHICH WILL BE MORE TO

00:57:20.870 --> 00:57:27.744
THOSE THREE AS- IT. A POOR ONE

00:57:27.811 --> 00:57:31.314
THAT IS AT THE- TERM GEN. SO WE

00:57:31.381 --> 00:57:34.984
KIND OF. SURE WERE SET THEIR

00:57:35.051 --> 00:57:37.120
OBVIOUS THAT CULTURE. AND BY

00:57:37.187 --> 00:57:38.888
THE FEW DIRECTOR AND PEOPLE WHO

TO BE BUT OF THAT THEY'RE VERY

00:57:56.606 --> 00:58:00.310
CLOSE THEY STAND THEIR JOB IS

00:58:00.376 --> 00:58:03.880
NOT THE NO BUT IS MUCH IS THIS

00:58:03.947 --> 00:58:05.615
TO BE THE PEOPLE WHO NOT ONLY

00:58:05.682 --> 00:58:09.719

00:58:09.786 --> 00:58:17.460
BUT ALSO. YOUR IT BECAUSE

00:58:17.527 --> 00:58:18.895
THAT'S WHAT THE PEOPLE YOU KNOW

00:58:18.962 --> 00:58:20.597
IN THE END THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE

00:58:20.663 --> 00:58:21.698
WANT TO KNOW IS THAT WE'RE

00:58:21.764 --> 00:58:23.233
BEING WE HAVE PEOPLE IN THE

00:58:23.299 --> 00:58:25.001
STATE THAT ARE PROTECTING US

00:58:25.068 --> 00:58:27.604
GREATER THINGS. IT SAYS THAT-

00:58:27.670 --> 00:58:28.905
AND SO WITH THAT WHAT IS TODAY

00:58:28.972 --> 00:58:30.139
INTEGRITY AND THEN THERE IS THE

00:58:30.206 --> 00:58:31.541
PEACE I MEAN I JUST WANTED TO

00:58:31.608 --> 00:58:33.743
EMPHASIZE BECAUSE I KNOW YOU

00:58:33.810 --> 00:58:35.879
SAID THAT WELL WE TAKE A PAUSE

00:58:35.945 --> 00:58:37.680
AND LOOKING AT. ABOUT IT SINCE

00:58:37.747 --> 00:58:40.250
FORCED AND IT AB YES MAYBE WE

00:58:40.316 --> 00:58:41.684
HAVEN'T GOT THAT DATA ENTIRELY

00:58:41.751 --> 00:58:43.353
RIGHT BUT I UP CONCERNED THAT

00:58:43.419 --> 00:58:45.355
WE TAKE OUT THE LANGUAGE THAT

00:58:45.421 --> 00:58:46.489
SAYS THAT THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE

00:58:46.556 --> 00:58:47.557
SUPPOSED TO DO THAT WILL

00:58:47.624 --> 00:58:49.425
EVENTUALLY GET LOST SO WE WILL

00:58:49.492 --> 00:58:51.361
NOT. THE CLEANUP A BETTER BUT

00:58:51.427 --> 00:58:55.365
ALSO. TO THAT IS BEING WHAT THE

00:58:55.431 --> 00:58:56.532
FUNCTION. BASICALLY MEANS NEED

00:58:56.599 --> 00:58:57.100
TO. BECAUSE NOW THERE'S NO

00:58:57.166 --> 00:58:59.602
LEGAL REQUIREMENT TO DO THAT-

00:58:59.669 --> 00:59:01.271
AND SO I THINK I WILL BE A

00:59:01.337 --> 00:59:02.572
LITTLE CAUTIOUS ABOUT THAT AS

00:59:02.639 --> 00:59:04.307

ABSOLUTELY AGREE AND WE

00:59:07.710 --> 00:59:09.412
RECOGNIZE GO. FORWARD THAT WE

00:59:09.479 --> 00:59:10.713
NEED A VERY STRUCTURED

01:14:22.991 --> 01:14:25.260
THE GENERAL CONCEPT- WE DON'T

01:14:25.327 --> 01:14:26.962
HAVE A LOT OF DETAILS BECAUSE

01:14:27.029 --> 01:14:28.096
THAT'S GOING TO BE THE WORK IN

01:14:28.163 --> 01:14:31.533
THE OFFICE OKAY. I THINK THAT

01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:34.036
NEEDS TO BE BETTER DEFINED

01:14:34.102 --> 01:14:35.804
SIMPLY BE KEY TO THIS BECAUSE

01:14:35.871 --> 01:14:40.242
WE'RE- ABOUT IT THEY CAN GO

01:14:40.309 --> 01:14:42.845
AROUND THEY GET ANYBODY IN THE-

01:14:42.911 --> 01:14:46.248
GOING AND PUT. YOUR FALL. EIGHT

01:14:46.315 --> 01:14:47.916
SO I THINK IT AT YOU FROM. FIND

01:14:47.983 --> 01:14:49.551
A BRING PEOPLE IN IN THE PEOPLE

01:14:49.618 --> 01:14:51.987
A START FINING PEOPLE I MEAN

01:14:52.054 --> 01:14:53.422
THAT TIME IS SOMEWHAT JAILING

01:14:53.488 --> 01:14:55.190
ANYONE DURING A FINE PEOPLE WE

01:14:55.257 --> 01:14:57.759
DEALT THE NEEDS AND- EXACTLY

01:14:57.826 --> 01:14:58.360
YOU KNOW WHAT THEIR

01:14:58.427 --> 01:15:02.130
RESPONSIBILITY A TRADE AND SO-

01:15:02.197 --> 01:15:04.933
I THINK IT. I THINK THAT WOULD

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:08.303
BE FINE AND SIMPLE TO DO YOU

01:15:08.370 --> 01:15:09.104
SIT THERE ARE AND HUNTER AND

01:15:09.171 --> 01:15:11.473
SAVE BY THE WAY WE NOW THIS YOU

01:15:11.540 --> 01:15:19.815
NOW OPPOSE ON YOU PAIN RIGHT OF.

01:15:19.882 --> 01:15:21.016
QUESTION OTHER WAYS BUT IF THEY

01:15:21.083 --> 01:15:22.718
WERE NOT DOING YOU KNOW

01:15:22.784 --> 01:15:23.318
PROVIDING HONEST LABOR ON THE

01:15:23.385 --> 01:15:26.555
SERVICES- TO THEN TURN AROUND

01:15:26.622 --> 01:15:29.391
AND FIND THEM. BECAUSE NOW

01:15:29.458 --> 01:15:30.392
THEY'RE THE ONES ARE BEING

01:15:30.459 --> 01:15:32.494
BLAMED FOR SO I MEAN THAT SO I

01:15:32.561 --> 01:15:34.596
THINK WE NEED TO FLESH THAT OUT

01:15:34.663 --> 01:15:37.065
A LOT MORE THAN SIMPLY A- YELL

01:15:37.132 --> 01:15:38.567
WILL HAVE AN END TO FIGURE IT

01:15:38.634 --> 01:15:40.335
OUT RIGHT. THAT A AND THEN I'M

01:15:40.402 --> 01:15:41.837
I'M A LAWYER BUT I DON'T WHEN

01:15:41.904 --> 01:15:42.871
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THINGS

01:15:42.938 --> 01:15:44.907
LIKE CIVIL FINES. THE PROBABLY

01:15:44.973 --> 01:15:47.142
NEEDS TO BE YEAH I'M I'M NOT

01:15:47.209 --> 01:15:49.578
SURE IN TERMS OF WHAT. YOU KNOW

01:15:49.645 --> 01:15:51.847
IN THE- THIRD PERSON THE FIGHT.

01:15:51.914 --> 01:15:52.981
IS RIGHTS AND PROTECTIONS TO

01:15:53.048 --> 01:15:54.616
RIGHT. RIGHT I WOULD SAY THREE

01:15:54.683 --> 01:15:56.184
THINGS WERE ON A SERVICES RIGHT

01:15:56.251 --> 01:15:58.220
YEAH YEAH I THINK THREE THINGS

01:15:58.287 --> 01:16:00.188
ONE IS THAT THAT'S WHY THERE IS

01:16:00.255 --> 01:16:02.190
A FULL REGULATORY PROCESSES

01:16:02.257 --> 01:16:03.759
COULD. BE IN PLACE. TO FILL UP

01:16:03.825 --> 01:16:05.994
ANY OF THESE BILLS- WHICH WILL

01:16:06.061 --> 01:16:08.163
TAKE UP ONLY AT LEAST A YEAR

01:16:08.230 --> 01:16:10.532
WITH. CLEARLY AMPLE OPPORTUNITY

01:16:10.599 --> 01:16:13.535
FOR INPUT AND- COMMENTS. AND GO

01:16:13.602 --> 01:16:14.269
THROUGH THE WHOLE LEGAL PROCESS

01:16:14.336 --> 01:16:16.505
INCLUDING THE APPEAL. AND IN

01:16:16.571 --> 01:16:18.140
THOSE PROVISIONS THAT PROTECT

01:16:18.206 --> 01:16:20.609
THE- PERSON UNDERSCORE. ARE THE

01:16:20.676 --> 01:16:23.045
AT INDUSTRY.TO IS. I MAY HAVE

01:16:23.111 --> 01:16:25.647
FIT THE END- EMPHASIZING THE

01:16:25.714 --> 01:16:28.016
PROGRESSIVE NATURE OF THIS. THE

01:16:28.083 --> 01:16:31.286
INTENT IS I MEAN. I KNOW

01:16:31.353 --> 01:16:34.723
RELIGION TENDS NOT TO SAY OH

01:16:34.790 --> 01:16:36.024
YOU DID THIS WE GO STRAIGHT.

01:16:36.091 --> 01:16:39.761
FIVE BUT IN. THE HOPE WE- THEN

01:16:39.828 --> 01:16:42.764
TEND TO. FIFTY CREDIT AND PLAN

01:16:42.831 --> 01:16:44.066
NOT EVEN TALK ABOUT FOR THAT RE

01:16:44.132 --> 01:16:45.000
HAVING THE DAY BY TRAINS MY

01:16:45.067 --> 01:16:46.868
HAVING CA. THE PEOPLE ARE ABLE

01:16:46.935 --> 01:16:48.036
TO LINE TO THAT GOAL AND THE

01:16:48.103 --> 01:16:49.638
REASON WE HAVE THAT HOPE

01:16:49.705 --> 01:16:50.806
ALTHOUGH MANY PEOPLE REMIND ME

01:16:50.872 --> 01:16:52.107
THAT CALIFORNIA RADICALLY

01:16:52.174 --> 01:16:53.675
DIFFERENT FROM MASSACHUSETTS IS

01:16:53.742 --> 01:16:55.377
THERE THE GROUP THIS HAD THE

01:16:55.444 --> 01:16:57.379
MOST EXPERIENCE AND FRANKLY

01:16:57.446 --> 01:16:59.948
THEY'VE NEVER EVEN GOTTEN TO A

01:17:00.015 --> 01:17:01.049
CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN SO AGAIN

01:17:01.116 --> 01:17:02.784
DON'T WATER EXPERT IN

01:17:02.851 --> 01:17:05.053
CALIFORNIA WE ARE. LARGER MORE

01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:07.089
DIVERSE IN COMP. EIGHT AND

01:17:07.155 --> 01:17:08.423
THERE SOME HELP FROM OTHER

01:17:08.490 --> 01:17:10.559
PLACES IN THE COUNTRY THAT BY

01:17:10.625 --> 01:17:11.159
HAVING THIS TARGET BY HAVING

01:17:11.226 --> 01:17:12.627
THE DATA BY HAVING THE

01:17:12.694 --> 01:17:13.862
CONVERSATIONS. YOU'RE NOT

01:17:13.929 --> 01:17:16.298
RUSHING TO PENALTIES OKAY WELL

01:17:16.365 --> 01:17:18.500
I THINK IF WE IF WE ARE GIVING

01:17:18.567 --> 01:17:20.569
SOMEONE THE AUTHORITY TO IMPOSE

01:17:20.635 --> 01:17:22.170
PENALTIES. FENDER SPEAK CLEARLY

01:17:22.237 --> 01:17:24.773
WAS ON HOW AND TO WHOM THOSE

01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:26.708
PENALTIES GET APPLIED AND UNDER

01:17:26.775 --> 01:17:29.344
WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES SO PEOPLE

01:17:29.411 --> 01:17:29.978
ARE VERY CLEAR AS TO WHEN. THEY

01:17:30.045 --> 01:17:32.414
ARE IN PENALTY YOU KNOW THAT.

01:17:32.481 --> 01:17:33.715
THEY MAY BE SUBJECT TO A

01:17:33.782 --> 01:17:36.651
PENALTY- SO AS I UNDERSTAND THE

01:17:36.718 --> 01:17:38.120
PROGRESSIVE NATURE BUT AT SOME

01:17:38.186 --> 01:17:39.988
POINT ONCE YOU KNOW VI&lt;c.cyan&gt;&lt;/c&gt;

01:17:40.055 --> 01:17:40.655
YOU'RE SAYING ONE OF THE THINGS

01:17:40.722 --> 01:17:45.060
WE COULD DO IS NOW BANNED- THE

01:17:45.127 --> 01:17:46.395
AND THIRD THEIR NEED. PEOPLE

01:17:46.461 --> 01:17:48.096
NEED TO KNOW THEY CAN'T JUST

01:17:48.163 --> 01:17:50.265
LIKE FALL INTO IT GREAT SO

01:17:50.332 --> 01:17:51.533
THAT'S I THINK THAT'S

01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:54.603
IMPORTANT- THE OTHER. THE YOU

01:17:54.669 --> 01:17:55.837
DID MENTION THAT THIS ALSO

01:17:55.904 --> 01:17:57.572
INCLUDES PRINCIPALLY ENDS THREE

01:17:57.639 --> 01:17:58.740
OF THE THIRTY TO INCLUDE RISA

01:17:58.807 --> 01:18:00.642
PLANS AGAIN THIS IS WHERE WE'RE

01:18:00.709 --> 01:18:02.844
AT SEEING AROUND IT SO IT

01:18:02.911 --> 01:18:05.747
REDUCES HIGH LEVEL PAYER DATA

01:18:05.814 --> 01:18:09.684
AND IN TALKING TO. THE STATES

01:18:09.751 --> 01:18:10.485
THAT ARE DOING THIS WHICH

01:18:10.552 --> 01:18:13.822
ACTUALLY INCLUDE- MASSACHUSETTS

01:18:13.889 --> 01:18:16.591
RHODE ISLAND DELAWARE AND-

01:18:16.658 --> 01:18:17.859
ORGAN ARE THE ONES THAT

01:18:17.926 --> 01:18:18.827
ACTUALLY HAVE THIS TYPE OF

01:18:18.894 --> 01:18:21.363
STATEWIDE COST TARGET- THERE

01:18:21.430 --> 01:18:24.266
HAS NOT YET BEEN ANY ISSUE.

01:18:24.332 --> 01:18:25.567
WITH REQUIRING AGAIN HIGH LEVEL

01:18:25.634 --> 01:18:26.902
DO WHEN WE'RE NOT TALKING AN H.

01:18:26.968 --> 01:18:28.804
P. THAT IS A TOLD THAT'S

01:18:28.870 --> 01:18:29.771
CLEARLY DELINEATED. PLANS ARE

01:18:29.838 --> 01:18:32.074
EXEMPT FROM A P. CITIES- THIS

01:18:32.140 --> 01:18:34.276
IS HIGH LIVER LEVEL DATA THAT

01:18:34.342 --> 01:18:35.577
AND HAS BEEN SUBMITTED AND

01:18:35.644 --> 01:18:37.546
WE'RE HOPING WILL BE SUBMITTED

01:18:37.612 --> 01:18:41.850
FOR US AS WELL. OKAY AND-

01:18:41.917 --> 01:18:43.051
ACTUALLY INTERESTING DETAIL

01:18:43.118 --> 01:18:46.421
TALK ABOUT WORKFORCE- BECAUSE-

01:18:46.488 --> 01:18:50.158
SO. WHEN THE DRIVERS OF HEALTH

01:18:50.225 --> 01:18:51.526
CARE COSTS AND THEY THINK

01:18:51.593 --> 01:18:53.829
MEDICARE'S IDENTIFIED THIS IS

01:18:53.895 --> 01:18:54.763

NOW IF YOU'RE IN AN UNDERSERVED

01:19:09.778 --> 01:19:12.247
AREA IT'S PROBABLY IS NEEDED

01:19:12.314 --> 01:19:13.949
UTILIZATION RATE SO THAT THEIR

01:19:14.015 --> 01:19:15.417
DUE TO AN ABSENCE ARE AT AN

01:19:15.484 --> 01:19:18.620
UNMET MEDICAL NEEDS- WE ALSO

DRIVEN BY UTILIZATION. ACTUALLY

01:19:41.076 --> 01:19:43.245
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE- FACT THAT

01:19:43.311 --> 01:19:44.146
HEALTH CARE COSTS HAVE

01:19:44.212 --> 01:19:46.114
INCREASED AT A HIGHER RATE THAN

MEASURE MOST OF IT IS AROUND

01:19:49.651 --> 01:19:50.819
THE PRICES RATHER THAN

01:19:50.886 --> 01:19:54.623
UTILIZATION. OR DEMOGRAPHIC

WHAT THAT. IS TO BE DETERMINED.

01:20:09.905 --> 01:20:13.208
AS AN ENTRY. SO IT'S- RATE IT'S-

01:20:13.275 --> 01:20:14.910

01:22:12.927 --> 01:22:15.497
DELVE INTO HIM LOOKING FORWARD

ANOTHER IS TO CALL OUT H. P.

01:22:51.666 --> 01:22:54.269

03:48:27.527 --> 03:48:29.996
IS. STUDIES BEEN ONE THAT'S

03:48:30.063 --> 03:48:31.731
BEEN FRAUGHT WITH CHALLENGES.

03:48:31.798 --> 03:48:33.499
BECAUSE I FIRST HEARD THIS OF

03:48:33.566 --> 03:48:34.934
BASICALLY. THE SAID WELL WE

DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE ANY DATA.

03:48:36.402 --> 03:48:38.204
RIGHT AND SO AND THEN THERE'S

03:48:38.271 --> 03:48:39.972
ALWAYS THIS YEAR OLD BY WELL

03:48:40.039 --> 03:48:42.308
COUPLE YEAR LAG ALL RIGHT- SO

03:48:42.375 --> 03:48:47.313
IN REGARDS TO FIRST OF ALL THE

CLEARLY WE YOU KNOW THE TRUST

03:48:57.323 --> 03:48:59.659
MANY OF THOSE ISSUES AND YOU

TALKED ABOUT ACTUALLYTRY TO

03:49:00.993 --> 03:49:02.895
EXPAND THE WAYS OF COLLECTING

03:49:02.962 --> 03:49:09.469
IT TO TRY TO MINIMIZE- BY. YOUR

03:49:09.535 --> 03:49:11.270
RESPONSE BRITAIN HAS WE GET

03:49:11.337 --> 03:49:16.042
MORE. AFTER I PRACTICE AND THEY

03:49:16.109 --> 03:49:17.910
ASK YOU THESE QUESTIONS YOU

03:49:17.977 --> 03:49:20.113
LOOK AT A GO I DON'T KNOW. TEAR

03:49:20.179 --> 03:49:21.080
GAS UP OF PRACTICE MANAGER

03:49:21.147 --> 03:49:22.949
BECAUSE YOU'RE WHAT IT TAKES

TOO BUSY SEEING PATIENTS. KEEP

03:49:26.853 --> 03:49:28.821
TRACK OF THAT. SO IN TERMS OF

03:49:28.888 --> 03:49:34.160
THE. YEAH I UNDERSTAND THAT THE

03:49:34.227 --> 03:49:35.995
DATA REPORTED SEVENTEEN

03:49:36.062 --> 03:49:37.396
EIGHTEEN THERE WERE SOME

03:49:37.463 --> 03:49:39.432
CONCERNS ABOUT SOME INDIVIDUAL

03:49:39.499 --> 03:49:41.701
CARRIES IT IT HAVE AN ACCURACY-

03:49:41.767 --> 03:49:43.402
BUT OBVIOUSLY IT PROVES BILLION

03:49:43.469 --> 03:49:46.272
TERMS OF LIKE DATA COLLECTION

03:49:46.339 --> 03:49:47.940
MOVING FORWARD FOR. WHAT ARE WE

03:49:48.007 --> 03:49:50.543
DOING TO SO YOU TO TALK ABOUT

03:49:50.610 --> 03:49:51.077
DIFFERENT WAYS TRYING TO

03:49:51.144 --> 03:49:53.312
COLLECT THE DATA THE DAY TIGER

03:49:53.379 --> 03:50:00.453
DE DO YOU FEEL LIKE- WHERE WE

03:50:00.520 --> 03:50:00.987
WAS TRYING TO IMPROVE THE

03:50:01.053 --> 03:50:02.755
QUALITY THAT THEY THAT WORK

03:50:02.822 --> 03:50:04.957
LIKE DATING SO YOU DO MENTION

WORKING. THIS IS A AREA THAT I

03:50:14.300 --> 03:50:16.102
THINK WE A LOT OF FOCUS ON OFF

03:50:16.169 --> 03:50:18.571
OF THE DAY THAT WAS REAP INTO

03:50:18.638 --> 03:50:20.273
FIFTEEN WE COULD EVEN CREATE

03:50:20.339 --> 03:50:22.808
PORTRAY WE SEE A GOOD AMOUNT OF

03:50:22.875 --> 03:50:25.845
TIME HANDS ON THAT I WHAT KEY

03:50:25.912 --> 03:50:28.014
FACTORS THAT WE APPLY.

03:50:28.080 --> 03:50:32.051

ALL AND RE. THAT BUT THEY'VE

03:50:34.820 --> 03:50:36.322
SUBMITTED WE'VE ALSO PUT IN

03:50:36.389 --> 03:50:39.025
SOME. KIND OF- FILTERS ON OUR

03:50:39.091 --> 03:50:40.226
SUBMISSION PROCESS THAT WILL

03:50:40.293 --> 03:50:41.894
PICK UP SOME OF THE CHALLENGES

03:50:41.961 --> 03:50:43.696
THE PLANTS CAN TRY TO SEARCH

03:50:43.763 --> 03:50:46.699
THEIR DATA TEST THAT TO SO THE

03:50:46.766 --> 03:50:49.302
NUMBER THINGS. ON THE RUN AND

03:50:49.368 --> 03:50:51.938

MORE CONSOLIDATION IN TERMS OF

03:50:58.311 --> 03:51:01.581
THE NUMBER OF CARS THAT ARE

THINGS AND SO- I THINK WERE

03:51:11.357 --> 03:51:13.826
PROVIDED TO CAN BE CONFUSING

03:51:13.893 --> 03:51:14.360

TO CONSOLIDATE SOME OF THAT SO

03:51:26.005 --> 03:51:27.406
THAT INSTEAD OF WRITER BEING

03:51:27.473 --> 03:51:28.708

IT'S NOT A FUNCTION THE

03:51:44.624 --> 03:51:45.324
DEPARTMENT WOULD TAKE ON WE

ABOUT A CONSOLIDATED APPROACH-

03:51:48.894 --> 03:51:51.430
THIS ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WE

03:51:51.497 --> 03:51:52.932
HAD IN TWENTY. AS WE ARE THAT

03:51:52.999 --> 03:51:55.401

COMES OUT IN THE MIDDLE

03:52:00.640 --> 03:52:02.742
DEPARTMENT AS THEIR DATA THAT

03:52:02.808 --> 03:52:05.711
IT'S ACCURATE- BUT I DO. AN

03:52:05.778 --> 03:52:08.547
AREA. BUT WE'VE ALL FLEXIBILITY

03:52:08.614 --> 03:52:10.182
TO DO THINGS LIKE SEND AN

03:52:10.249 --> 03:52:13.586
EMAIL- HAVE A PORTAL- ONE OF

03:52:13.653 --> 03:52:15.488
THE CHALLENGES THAT WE'VE HAD

03:52:15.554 --> 03:52:16.622
IS THE PRACTICE MANAGEMENT

03:52:16.689 --> 03:52:19.058
SYSTEMS ARE NOT. LEVEL

03:52:19.125 --> 03:52:21.627
SOPHISTICATION BERRIES- BUT

03:52:21.694 --> 03:52:22.495
WE'VE ALLOWED SOME FLEXIBILITY

03:52:22.561 --> 03:52:24.697
THAT AT THAT ADVANCES IN THE

03:52:24.764 --> 03:52:26.365
TECH ADVANCES AND WE HAVE MORE

03:52:26.432 --> 03:52:28.167
DATA AVAILABLE THAT COULD BE

03:52:28.234 --> 03:52:30.770
LEVERAGED TO COMPLETE JUST

03:52:30.836 --> 03:52:31.404
MAKING PHONE CALLS. SO THIS IS

03:52:31.470 --> 03:52:35.207
REPORTED. DATE WE JUST FINISHED

03:52:35.274 --> 03:52:37.243
TWENTY NINETEEN. IS THE TWENTY

03:52:37.310 --> 03:52:39.045
THREE THINK THE DATA TWENTY

03:52:39.111 --> 03:52:41.013
NINETEEN IS BETTER DATA WE GOT

03:52:41.080 --> 03:52:42.848
TWENTY EIGHTEEN I HOPE SO MARCH

03:52:42.915 --> 03:52:43.749
THIRTY FIRST AS A SUBMISSION

03:52:43.816 --> 03:52:45.418
DEADLINE AS LONG AS IT'S ON A

03:52:45.484 --> 03:52:48.387
SUNDAY- I THINK ONE OF THE

03:52:48.454 --> 03:52:50.323
THINGS THAT WE HAVE SEEN IN

03:52:50.389 --> 03:52:57.463
YEARS IS INSIST GOT- WE MADE.

03:52:57.530 --> 03:53:00.266
BUT ALL DONE. THE PLAN

03:53:00.333 --> 03:53:02.668
HIGHLIGHTED WHERE THE THIS ARMS

03:53:02.735 --> 03:53:03.903
AGAIN I OUR HOPE AND EXPECT IS

03:53:03.969 --> 03:53:06.138
THE DATA WILL TO BETTER OKAY.

03:53:06.205 --> 03:53:08.107
AND THEN. SO YOU MENTIONED

03:53:08.174 --> 03:53:10.910
DOING RIG SON THE ACTUAL RATE

03:53:10.976 --> 03:53:14.747
OF COMPLIANCE- IF YOU PUT OUT

03:53:14.814 --> 03:53:17.383
ANY PRELIMINARY RATE OR

03:53:17.450 --> 03:53:19.251
SOMETHING I MEAN WHAT RATES ARE

03:53:19.318 --> 03:53:21.520
WE LOOKING AT. SURE TO DRAFT-

03:53:21.587 --> 03:53:22.922
AND THAT WE SHOULD- IS A RED

03:53:22.988 --> 03:53:25.991
COMPLAINTS A 70% FOR URGENT AN

03:53:26.058 --> 03:53:30.930
HONOR GENTE THAT IS NOT IS NOT.

03:53:30.996 --> 03:53:32.698
THE RIGHT IT'S COMING THE

03:53:32.765 --> 03:53:33.299
PERCENT OF THE NUMBER THAT'S

03:53:33.366 --> 03:53:37.470
BEEN. OKAY ALL RIGHT AS IT 70%

03:53:37.536 --> 03:53:40.473
IS A HIGH. IT IS A MIA'S IS

03:53:40.539 --> 03:53:42.308
ABLE I MEAN I GUESS WE WE'VE

03:53:42.375 --> 03:53:44.677
MAY HAVE PEOPLE HERE WHO WERE

03:53:44.744 --> 03:53:46.946
INVOLVED IN THE BILL'S THAT

03:53:47.012 --> 03:53:49.615
WERE PASSED WHEN. PUSH THE

03:53:49.682 --> 03:53:51.650
EIGHT. I THINK THE WORST OF

03:53:51.717 --> 03:53:52.151
THAT STANDARD IS BEING

03:53:52.218 --> 03:53:54.019
SOMETHING ASPIRATIONAL I THINK

03:53:54.086 --> 03:53:55.254
THE OTHER THING YOU KNOW THAT

03:53:55.321 --> 03:53:55.955
AS A MINIMUM PERFORMANCE

03:53:56.021 --> 03:53:59.325
STANDARD AND NOW WE'RE SAYING.

03:53:59.392 --> 03:54:00.192
THE TIME YOU HAVE TO MEET THE

03:54:00.259 --> 03:54:01.761
MINIMUM FORM INSTEAD I REALIZE

03:54:01.827 --> 03:54:04.363
THIS. SPEC BY KILL THE TOP IS

03:54:04.430 --> 03:54:09.034
THE FIRST. 9% IN THE BOTTOM 67%

03:54:09.101 --> 03:54:12.071
AND SO RIGHT NOW THEORETICALLY

03:54:12.138 --> 03:54:13.873
AT LEAST ACCORDING TO THE GRAPH

03:54:13.939 --> 03:54:17.143
I HAVE TO GIVE YOU SAID 70% IS

03:54:17.209 --> 03:54:18.577
ONLY THREE PLANS BELOW THAT-

03:54:18.644 --> 03:54:22.515
BUT USE DO YOU THINK ABOUT IT

03:54:22.581 --> 03:54:24.950
SAID OF ALL 70% OF TOP OF THE-

03:54:25.017 --> 03:54:29.955
THAT. AT QUITE THREE IT'S

03:54:30.022 --> 03:54:32.992
THAT'S A LOT THAT'S SO IN THE

03:54:33.058 --> 03:54:34.894
AT THE SAME TIME WE TURN AROUND

03:54:34.960 --> 03:54:36.695
AND I MEAN I I'VE BEEN ON THE

03:54:36.762 --> 03:54:39.432
FLOOR NAY SAID ALL WE HAVE

03:54:39.498 --> 03:54:41.767
TIMELY STANDARD SO WE'RE NOT

03:54:41.834 --> 03:54:43.803
WE'RE NETWORK ADEQUACY. EXCEPT

03:54:43.869 --> 03:54:47.640
ME TO SET ASIDE. SO I'VE MET IT

03:54:47.706 --> 03:54:49.642
DOES BEG THE QUESTION A LITTLE

03:54:49.708 --> 03:54:50.242
BIT TO ME I MEAN I APPRECIATE

03:54:50.309 --> 03:54:52.144
YOU SEE WITH ME AND THOSE

03:54:52.211 --> 03:54:54.713
DISCUSSIONS ARE HAPPENING BUT

03:54:54.780 --> 03:54:56.015
IT. AND I GUESS I CAN ASK THE

03:54:56.081 --> 03:54:58.751
FOLKS TO SPOT WHO SPONSORED THE

03:54:58.818 --> 03:54:59.852
BILL THAT CENTER HERNANDEZ

03:54:59.919 --> 03:55:01.720
PASSIVELY THINKING THAT THAT

03:55:01.787 --> 03:55:02.922
WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A STRETCH

03:55:02.988 --> 03:55:05.257
GOAL WHEN THEY PUT THOSE

03:55:05.324 --> 03:55:07.326
NUMBERS IN OUR THAT THE MINIMUM

03:55:07.393 --> 03:55:08.894
PERFORMANCE THEY WERE HOPING.

03:55:08.961 --> 03:55:10.896
WE NOW A LITTLE BIT ACOSTA NEXT

03:55:10.963 --> 03:55:11.530
I THINK A COUPLE OF THINGS THE

03:55:11.597 --> 03:55:13.699
TIMELY ACCESS DINNERS.

03:55:13.766 --> 03:55:14.834
GUARANTEE THAT YOU WILL GET AN

03:55:14.900 --> 03:55:16.435
APPOINTMENT WITH PROJECT.

03:55:16.502 --> 03:55:18.437
WRITER SO EAGER TO REPEAT A

03:55:18.504 --> 03:55:20.706
TRUSTED AND THE YOU KNOW WORLD

03:55:20.773 --> 03:55:24.310
RENOWNED CARDIOLOGIST- IT'S-

03:55:24.376 --> 03:55:24.844
THAT WORK HAS TO HAVE THE

03:55:24.910 --> 03:55:26.479
COUPON. TO MEET FAMILY ACCESS

03:55:26.545 --> 03:55:29.014
RIGHT. ONE OF THE CRITICAL

03:55:29.081 --> 03:55:32.485
PIECES OF THIS THIS IS REALLY

03:55:32.551 --> 03:55:33.986
ABOUT STE STICKS MANY. AS WE

03:55:34.053 --> 03:55:36.222
TRYING. BASED THE REAL ALL

03:55:36.288 --> 03:55:39.859
APPROACH. TO PULL AMPLE OF THE

03:55:39.925 --> 03:55:44.663
NETWORK. TO PUT TO. THE TO THE

03:55:44.730 --> 03:55:46.265
ACT THE STATE. BOB SO OF THE

03:55:46.332 --> 03:55:49.368
CITY IS. BEST UP. WERE SOME

03:55:49.435 --> 03:55:51.537
SAMPLE TO DO ABILITY OF THE

03:55:51.604 --> 03:55:53.973
SAYS ONE. OF AN INTERESTED

03:55:54.039 --> 03:55:55.107
APPROACH IF YOU WERE TO REPEAT

03:55:55.174 --> 03:55:56.509
THAT IN THREE ATTEMPTS YOU

03:55:56.575 --> 03:55:59.478
WOULD MEET THE STANDARD SO

03:55:59.545 --> 03:56:02.181
AGAIN I THINK THERE'S THIS

03:56:02.248 --> 03:56:03.582
UNDERSTANDING FOR ITS THREE

03:56:03.649 --> 03:56:08.387
HUNDRED PER TO HAVE WRITERS AT.

03:56:08.454 --> 03:56:11.390
THE ONE FROM THE VACATION THERE

03:56:11.457 --> 03:56:15.694
IN PART TIME THE WHAT SAYS OF.

03:56:15.761 --> 03:56:17.229
AVAILABILITY ON THAT AT THE

03:56:17.296 --> 03:56:18.163
TIME TO MEET THE ARE STANDARDS

03:56:18.230 --> 03:56:20.199
SO FROM A STATISTICAL APPROACH

03:56:20.266 --> 03:56:23.569
70% SEEMS TO BE KIND OF THE

03:56:23.636 --> 03:56:24.136
APPROACH FOR IF YOU WERE TO

03:56:24.203 --> 03:56:26.639
MAKE KIND OF REAP. PROCESS BUT

03:56:26.705 --> 03:56:29.975
OR TO. STAND OF THE OTHER PIECE

03:56:30.042 --> 03:56:31.076
I WANT TO POINT OUT IS THE

03:56:31.143 --> 03:56:33.012
NUMBERS IS A CLEARLY HE SAID SO

REPORT IS CURRENTLY AT THE

03:57:46.986 --> 03:57:50.522
AGGREGATE LEVEL AND AGAIN WE

03:57:50.589 --> 03:57:51.123

OF COMPLIANCE THAT WE ARE

03:58:15.614 --> 03:58:18.717

QUESTION- BEFORE I CAME HERE

04:03:59.224 --> 04:04:02.761
AND SO. YES IT IS THAT IT WILL

04:04:02.828 --> 04:04:05.230
THE ONE MILLION WOULD BE

04:04:05.297 --> 04:04:08.166
SUBTRACTED FROM THAT NINE.

04:04:08.233 --> 04:04:11.069
START THE NOT. TO KNOW NINE

04:04:11.136 --> 04:04:11.603
HUNDRED AND TWENTY BILLION

04:04:11.670 --> 04:04:13.405
WOULD BE SUBTRACTED FROM NOT.

04:04:13.472 --> 04:04:15.240
ONLY DO IT IN THAT WAY TOO THE

04:04:15.307 --> 04:04:16.108
IN THEM BECAUSE HE BATES ARE

04:04:16.174 --> 04:04:19.978
OUT. I AM. OVER YOU KNOW

04:04:20.045 --> 04:04:21.646
DIFFERENT PERIODS OF TIME AND

04:04:21.713 --> 04:04:25.517
THERE AND MAYBE NOT OR IN THE-

04:04:25.584 --> 04:04:29.021
NEAR AS THE SO EIGHT EIGHT.

04:04:29.087 --> 04:04:34.159
TOLL. THAT WAY. YES YOUR RIGHT

04:04:34.226 --> 04:04:37.095
BE THOUGHT TO FROM THE TOTAL OF

04:04:37.162 --> 04:04:38.196
BUT BECAUSE THE COST THERE'S

04:04:38.263 --> 04:04:41.366
OUT WE DO KNOW IT THE YEAR THAT

04:04:41.433 --> 04:04:43.101
THEY'RE SPREAD WE REPORTED OUT

04:04:43.168 --> 04:04:44.936
THAT WAY OKAY SO I THINK I

04:04:45.003 --> 04:04:46.905
THINK WE HAVE A FULL THEN IN

04:04:46.972 --> 04:04:50.108
TURN- WE ALWAYS SAY BECAUSE

04:04:50.175 --> 04:04:54.613
THAT'S- THAT'S LIKE 10% RIGHT.

04:04:54.679 --> 04:04:56.148
ELEVEN POINT SEVENTY OLYMPIC 7%

04:04:56.214 --> 04:04:57.783
SO THAT MEANS THE ACTUAL SPEND

04:04:57.849 --> 04:05:00.552
THE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS ISN'T IS

04:05:00.619 --> 04:05:02.120
SHOULD BE ELEVEN POINT 7% LESS

04:05:02.187 --> 04:05:03.655
BECAUSE I MEANYEAH YOU'RE

04:05:03.722 --> 04:05:04.556
RIGHT THERE IT'S COMING

04:05:04.623 --> 04:05:06.224
DIFFERENT YEAR ETCETERA BUT THE

04:05:06.291 --> 04:05:09.861
BUT THE SO THE NODES DATE THE

04:05:09.928 --> 04:05:11.830
GIVEN THE WAY WERE DESCRIBING

04:05:11.897 --> 04:05:14.232
IT WERE CUT OVER REPORTING THE

04:05:14.299 --> 04:05:16.568
PMR SPENDING ON PRESCRIPTION.

04:05:16.635 --> 04:05:18.970
THE YES NUMBER SEVEN HE'S

04:05:19.037 --> 04:05:20.138
REBATE WHICH DOESN ACTUALLY GO

04:05:20.205 --> 04:05:21.540
TO PAY FOR DRUGS IS GOING FOR

04:05:21.606 --> 04:05:22.808
SOMETHING ELSE I MEAN WHETHER

04:05:22.874 --> 04:05:24.676
IT'S POCKET SOMEONE'S. BEING

04:05:24.743 --> 04:05:27.813
GREEN BAY SOME OTHER THING.

04:05:27.879 --> 04:05:28.814
IT'S NOT BEING SPENT SEVEN DID

04:05:28.880 --> 04:05:30.348
AT A REALIZE IT'S COMING OFF A

04:05:30.415 --> 04:05:31.750
DIFFERENT TIMES IT'S AT AROUND

04:05:31.817 --> 04:05:34.619
BUT I MEAN JUST AGAIN FOR.

04:05:34.686 --> 04:05:37.622
ACTORS IN TRANSPARENCY I THINK

04:05:37.689 --> 04:05:40.759
WE ARE. A REBATE IS NOT THE

04:05:40.826 --> 04:05:42.294
SPEND ON PRESCRIPTION DRUGS

04:05:42.360 --> 04:05:43.929

ACTUAL. SO COSTELLO BUT MOSTLY

04:06:49.961 --> 04:06:51.830
IT IT'S NOT THE OVERALL SPEND

04:06:51.897 --> 04:06:53.765
ON FUTURE DOES THAT PATIENTS

04:06:53.832 --> 04:06:54.833

SOME PEOPLE DON'T HAVE ANY KIND

05:09:16.304 --> 05:09:18.172

THE MORE WE CAN MOVE THAT

05:09:29.884 --> 05:09:32.353
DIRECT. I'M POLITICS. WE'VE

05:09:32.420 --> 05:09:34.155
BEEN PLANNING FOR PAN THAT FOR

05:09:34.222 --> 05:09:35.490
A LONG TIME WE KNOW THAT IF

05:09:35.556 --> 05:09:37.759
THIS COP REALLY BAD WE WOULD

05:09:37.825 --> 05:09:38.960
NEED SOMETHING EYOND WHAT WE

05:09:39.027 --> 05:09:43.831
CAN DO IN OUR OUR SYSTEM AND SO

05:09:43.898 --> 05:09:46.501
BEEN PLANNING FOR- DIFFERENT

05:09:46.567 --> 05:09:48.436
TYPES OF CARE APPLE BUT

05:09:48.503 --> 05:09:50.738
PLANNING FOR THE WORST BUT- WE

05:09:50.805 --> 05:09:52.840

PROVIDERS RIDER ASSOCIATION.

05:09:56.344 --> 05:09:58.279
BECAUSE THOSE ORDINARY NOW TO

05:09:58.346 --> 05:10:02.850
KEEP PLANNING THINGS THAT. WE

05:10:02.917 --> 05:10:07.221
ARE. PLAY COMES FROM. FINANCE

05:10:07.288 --> 05:10:11.326
YES PLEASE. SENATE

05:10:11.392 --> 05:10:14.295
PARTICULARLY- M. WE DID HAVE

05:10:14.362 --> 05:10:18.333
ONE QUESTION- IS WHETHER THE

05:10:18.399 --> 05:10:21.269
EMERGENCY FUNDING AT THE STATE

05:10:21.336 --> 05:10:24.205
LEVEL- WHAT HOW THAT BEING. THE

05:10:24.272 --> 05:10:25.673
TWENTY THE TWENTY MILLION YEAH

05:10:25.740 --> 05:10:28.242
THAT'S ACTUALLY THE UP THERE'S

05:10:28.309 --> 05:10:29.444
A TWENTY MILLION REQUESTED

05:10:29.510 --> 05:10:30.645
WASN'T VERY MUCH SPECIFICITY

05:10:30.712 --> 05:10:33.448
ABOUT WHAT THE- WHAT THE

05:10:33.514 --> 05:10:36.250
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING USED FOR.

05:10:36.317 --> 05:10:37.852
DON'T QUESTION THE- FACT MAYBE

05:10:37.919 --> 05:10:39.387
MORE LATER WE ARE CONTINUING TO

05:10:39.454 --> 05:10:40.521
LOOK AT THAT AND I THINK PART

05:10:40.588 --> 05:10:43.658
OF IT IS UNDERSTANDING WHAT WE

05:10:43.725 --> 05:10:45.727
CAN DO WITH THE FEDERAL DOLLARS

05:10:45.793 --> 05:10:47.395
ON THEM LOOKING WHERE THE CAPS

05:10:47.462 --> 05:10:51.366
ARE. THEY HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS

05:10:51.432 --> 05:10:54.902
UP SO. THE SITUATION WITH THE

05:10:54.969 --> 05:10:58.306
TESTING RIGHT- ON THE ALSO

05:10:58.373 --> 05:10:59.741
SURVEYS THAT WE DO HERE A

05:10:59.807 --> 05:11:01.442
LITTLE BIT MIXED MESSAGES IN

05:11:01.509 --> 05:11:03.311
TERMS AVAILABILITY OF TESTS

05:11:03.378 --> 05:11:06.481
RIGHT SO I UNDERSTAND THAT CC

05:11:06.547 --> 05:11:07.715
SENDS OUT THESE KIDS BUT THE

05:11:07.782 --> 05:11:11.019
KIDS ARE VERY. I SAY NOT

05:11:11.085 --> 05:11:12.887
COMPLETE THEY DON'T ALLOW OU

05:11:12.954 --> 05:11:14.822
TO DO THE ENTIRE TEST THAT THE

05:11:14.889 --> 05:11:16.224
KIDS COME TEN CERTAIN

05:11:16.290 --> 05:11:17.692
COMPONENTS IN THIS RESEARCH THE

05:11:17.759 --> 05:11:19.360
LAB RESULTS FINALLY THE OTHER

05:11:19.427 --> 05:11:20.395
COMPONENTS AND SOME OF THOSE

05:11:20.461 --> 05:11:21.763
OTHER COMPONENTS MAY BE

05:11:21.829 --> 05:11:23.798
AVAILABLE TO THAT LAB OR

05:11:23.865 --> 05:11:25.199
SOMETHING SO. THAT'S AND

05:11:25.266 --> 05:11:27.235
HITTING. AND THEN THERE'S I

05:11:27.301 --> 05:11:28.936
HEARD SOMETHING IS ALONG THE

05:11:29.003 --> 05:11:30.605
LINES OF WELL WE CAN'T DO THE

05:11:30.671 --> 05:11:32.440
TEST BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE

05:11:32.507 --> 05:11:33.541
PERMISSION EXIT OFF BEAT

05:11:33.608 --> 05:11:35.076
CERTAIN CRITERIA. OF THE

05:11:44.485 --> 05:11:45.753
THERE'S NO QUOTE THERE'S NO

05:11:45.820 --> 05:11:48.022
BACKLOG BUT THE SAME TIME WE

05:11:48.089 --> 05:11:49.123
KNOW PEOPLE ARE OUT THERE SO

05:11:49.190 --> 05:11:50.191
WE'LL JUST HEAR MY OWN

05:11:50.258 --> 05:11:52.393
DISTRICT. WE HAVE A SYSTEM

05:11:52.460 --> 05:11:53.661
FACILITY THERE'S A LOT OF

05:11:53.728 --> 05:11:55.963
PEOPLE THERE WE HAVE ONE WOMAN

05:11:56.030 --> 05:11:57.932
WHO PASSED AWAY AND I'M IN

05:11:57.999 --> 05:11:59.934
PASSED AWAY. AND TO LIKE WELL

05:12:00.001 --> 05:12:01.402
HOW THE PEOPLE YOU TESTING

THEY'RE GOING AND SO. THERE

05:12:03.404 --> 05:12:05.807
ISN'T A BACKLOG BUT YET WE'RE

05:12:05.873 --> 05:12:07.175
NOT TESTING PEOPLE AND PEOPLE

05:12:07.241 --> 05:12:09.410
THEY WERE SHOULD TO. AND IT'S

05:12:09.477 --> 05:12:14.015
THE- A BACK. HAVE ENOUGH SO

05:12:14.082 --> 05:12:15.316
THERE FOR THEY DON'T. ORDER

05:12:15.383 --> 05:12:16.751
THEM. SO THERE'S A LOT OF.

05:12:16.818 --> 05:12:18.753
AROUND TEST AVAIL. IS THAT

05:12:18.820 --> 05:12:21.122
CENTER- I THINK MOST PEOPLE.

05:12:21.189 --> 05:12:22.623
ANY TELL ME ONE WRONG MOST

05:12:22.690 --> 05:12:23.691

DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TEST PERIOD.

05:12:25.226 --> 05:12:26.994
THAT PROVIDE A PROBLEM BUT IS

05:12:27.061 --> 05:12:27.995
THAT ALSO THEREFORE CAUSING

05:12:28.062 --> 05:12:29.397
PEOPLE TO BEHAVE IN CERTAIN

05:12:29.464 --> 05:12:32.033
WAYS THAT. IT IS REFLECTING THE

05:12:32.100 --> 05:12:33.668
REAL DEMAND THAT WE SHOULD BE

05:12:33.734 --> 05:12:35.670
HAVING FOR TESTING. WHAT THE

05:12:35.736 --> 05:12:38.739
HELL YOU THINK ABOUT SOUTH. IN

TERMS OF BEILINSON SO.

05:12:39.507 --> 05:12:42.543
COUNTRIES THERE TURN THE CURVE.

05:12:42.610 --> 05:12:44.645
EIGHT COMPARED TO SO WE STE

05:12:44.712 --> 05:12:47.615
WE'RE FLYING BLIND BECAUSE THE

05:12:47.682 --> 05:12:49.016
NUMBER TOTAL NUMBER OF TESTS

05:12:49.083 --> 05:12:50.384
THAT WERE A BIT THAT WE'VE BEEN

05:12:50.451 --> 05:12:52.854
ABLE TO DO. NOT JUST IN

05:12:52.920 --> 05:12:54.622
CALIFORNIA ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

05:12:54.689 --> 05:12:56.190
TRY DOESN'T REFLECT WHAT'S

05:12:56.257 --> 05:12:58.226
REALLY GOING ON OUT THERE IS

05:12:58.292 --> 05:13:00.628

05:13:01.462 --> 05:13:03.331
SURVEILLANCE TESTING I THINK IN

05:13:03.397 --> 05:13:07.368
TERMS OF TREATMENT DOESN'T

05:13:07.435 --> 05:13:10.404
CHANGE THAT MUCH WE ARE

05:13:10.471 --> 05:13:13.274
PREPARED TO GET TOUGH. CLOUT

05:13:13.341 --> 05:13:14.909
I'M JUST CAME ONLINE THIS WEEK

05:13:14.976 --> 05:13:15.676
AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH

CA BOBCORE AND THEIR

05:13:17.745 --> 05:13:20.748
RAMPING UP THEIR CAPACITY I

05:13:20.815 --> 05:13:21.916
THINK WE STILL WANT TO WEAR

05:13:21.983 --> 05:13:23.851
TIES. BE TESTED AND THEN MOVED

05:13:23.918 --> 05:13:29.924
TO THE. WE ACTUALLY HAVE OUT
