THIRTY SECOND WARNING. ALRIGHT WE'RE GOING. BE OKAY WE'LL GET GOING WITH TODAY'S BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE HEARING ON EDUCATION FINANCE. THIS IS A ON ONE ISSUE TODAY RELATES TO OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE. MANY COLLEGES THIS IS IT A JOINT HEARING. WE HAVE INVITED THE HIGHER EDUCATION COMMITTEE TO PARTICIPATE. WELL CHAIRMAN MEDINA AND A FEW OTHERS. ARE ON THEIR WAY. BUT WE WERE ALL OUT WE WILL BEGIN. WE'LL HAVE THE ART DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THAT THE LA OPEN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES GIVE AN OVERVIEW. OF THE NEW FUNDING FORMULA THAT PROPOSAL. AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE WERE INTRIGUED ABOUT LAST YEAR PASSED THE LA OUT TO HELP US. FRAME THE ISSUE AND. TALK ABOUT OPPORTUNITIES TO MAKE SURE WE INVEST IN OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS FOCUSING ON. HOW THE STUDENTS WHO COULD UTILIZE THE MOST HELP SIMILAR TO WHAT WE DID WITH LCF HALF? AND. RIGHT ABOUT THE SAME TIME THAT ELLIOT CAME OUT THE REPORT THE GOVERNOR CAME OUT WITH A PROPOSAL IN THE JANUARY TEN BUDGET SO. WE CAN LOOK AT THAT IDEA TODAY. EVALUATES IT AND. PUT PUT INTO CONSIDERATION FOR THE. FINAL BUDGET SO WITH THAT BALLOTS BEGIN BLAST FIRST THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO GIVE US AN OVERVIEW. IT THINK HUMOR ITS VOTE HE SAU WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AS A BEFORE ID TOME AND PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE PROPOSAL FOR STUDENT FOCUSED FUNDING FORMULA I WANT TO BEGIN BY. I'M PROVIDING SOME BRIEF BACKGROUND ON THE EXISTING MODEL AND HIGHLIGHT THE PROBLEMS AND AND CONCERNS WITH THE EXISTING I'M FUNNY MODEL. SO COMMITTEE COLLEGES CURRENTLY RECEIVE ABOUT THREE QUARTERS OF DEFINING THROUGH GENERAL PURPOSE PORTION MEN'S IT'S ABOUT SEVEN. AT BILLION FOR PORTION MEN'S PROPOSED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. A PORTION OF FUNDING IS DISTRIBUTED TO DISTRICT. TO DISTRICTS BASED PRIMARILY ON A ROMANCE OF FULL TIME EQUIVALENT STUDENTS AB T. S.. I WOULD NOTE THAT F. T. AS HIS GENERATED GENERALLY CALCULATED ON ENROLLMENT OF STUDENTS AT A SPECIFIC POINT IN TIME WHICH TYPICALLY OCCURS AT AT SAYS SENSES STATE EARLY AM IN THE TERM. WE KNOW THAT FUNDING MODELS OFTEN THE MODELS CREATE INCENTIVES AND A PRIMARY CONCERN WITH THE EXISTING A ROMAN BASE FUNNY MODEL IS THAT IT ENCOURAGES DISTRICTS TO PRIORITIZE. ENROLLMENT AND ENROLLMENT GROWTH. WITHOUT REGARD FOR STUDENT SUCCESS SUCH AS TIMELY COMPLETION AND BETTER SERVING UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS. THE CURRENT MODEL ACTUALLY DISCOURAGES DISTRICTS FROM INNOVATIVE PRACTICES THAT REDUCE I'M ACCESS UNITS AN INCREASE TIMELY COMPLETION GIVEN THAT THAT CAN RESULT IN A REDUCTION OF AB T. AS. AND AS A RESULT OF REDUCTION OF REVENUE FOR THE COLLEGE. THE EXISTING ENROLLMENT BASED MONEY MODEL IS ALSO CREATING SIGNIFICANT LONG TERM PLANNING HARDSHIPS FOR DISTRICTS BECAUSE COMMUNITY COLLEGE ROMANCE IS COUNTER CYCLICAL TO THAT KIND OF ME. SO WE KNOW THAT WHEN ECONOMIC TIMES ARE GOOD COMMITTEE COLLEGE ENROLLMENT REMAINS FLATTER DECLINE SWITCHES WHAT IS CURRENTLY HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. AND WHEN ECONOMIC TIMES ARE BAD. A ROMAN DEMAND INCREASES AT THE SAME TIME FUNDING FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE GENERALLY INCREASES WHEN ECONOMIC TIMES ARE GOOD AND DECLINES WHEN ECONOMIC TIMES OUR BATTLE IS REALLY. A DISCONNECT THERE. SO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES IN NEW SUIT AND FOCUS FUNDING FORMULA FOR THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNICABLE EDGES THAT RECOGNIZES FACTORS BEYOND THE NUMBER OF FULL TIME EQUIVALENT STUDENTS ENROLLED. THE PRIMARY GOAL IS TO ALIGN THE FUNNY MODEL WITH THE GOALS OF THE VISION FOR SUCCESS AND THE SERVE STUDENTS AND TO ELIMINATE EQUITY CAPS. MOVING AWAY FROM ENROLLMENT BASE FUNNY MODEL IS ALSO EXPECTED TO CREATE GREATER FISCAL STABILITY FOR DISTRICTS. THE PROPOSAL IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AT CREATES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR COLLEGES TO GROW FISCALLY BY IMPROVING ON STUDENT SUCCESS METRICS AND ENSURING ACCESS FOR LOW INCOME STUDENTS. BY MOVING AWAY FROM ENROLLMENT GROWTH MODEL AND SAID FOCUSING ON TIMELY COMPLETION OF EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS REDUCING EXCESS UNITS AND FURTHERING STUDENT SUCCESS EFFORTS. IT ALSO EXPANDS ACCESS BY CREATING ROOM FOR ADDITIONAL ENROLLMENT WHICH IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT DURING A RECESSION. TO ACCOMPLISH THESE GOALS THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES A FUNDING FORMULA FOR PORTION MEN'S WITH THREE COMPONENTS. FIRST EACH DISTRICT WOULD RECEIVE A BASE GRANT THAT IS BASED ON A ROMANTIC AT SOMEONE TO THE EXISTING. MODEL. SLIPPED FULL TIME EQUIVALENT STUDENT RATE AS THAT WOULD BE A PROP UP PLATE ACROSS THE DISTRICTS. EACH A STRIP WILL ALSO RECEIVE A SUPPLEMENTAL GRANT BASED ON THE NUMBER OF LOW INCOME STUDENTS THAT THE DISTRICT ENROLLS SPECIFICALLY THIS INCLUDES ENROLLMENT OF STUDENTS RECEIVE A CALIFORNIA CALLED A CALIFORNIA ON COLLEGE PROMISE GRANT. THE WAIVER AND ENROLLMENT OF STUDENTS RECEIVE A PELL GRANT. FINALLY EACH DISTRICT RECEIVED A STUDENT SUCCESS INCENTIVE GRANT BASED ON THE NUMBER OF DEGREES AND CERTIFICATES GRANTED AND THE NUMBER STUDENTS TO COMPLETE A DEGREE OR CERTIFICATE OR TRANSFER IN THREE YEARS OR LESS. THE GRANT ALSO INCLUDES ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR EACH ASSOCIATE DEGREE. FOR TRANSFER EDT GRANTED AS A WAY TO FURTHER AND SEND DATA SEAMLESS TRANSFER AND EXPERIENCE. THE PROPOSAL ASSUMES THAT APPROXIMATELY FIFTY PERCENT OF GENERAL PURPOSE APPORTIONMENT WOULD BE DISTRIBUTED INITIALLY AS A BASE GROUND AT TWENTY FIVE PERCENT DISTRIBUTED AS A SUPPLEMENTAL GRANT. AND TWENTY FIVE PERCENT DISTRIBUTED AS THE. AS PART OF THE STUDENT SUCCESS INCENTIVE GRANTS. UNDER THE PROPOSAL DISTRICTS WOULD ALSO BE REQUIRED TO ALIGN I'D THE GOALS IN THEIR EDUCATION MASTER PLANS WHAT THE GOALS OUTLINED IN THE VISION FOR SUCCESS INCLUDING ACTIONS FOR MEASURING PROGRESS TOWARDS A SCHOOLS. AND DISTRICTS WOULD BE REQUIRED TO ALIGN THEIR BUDGETS WITHOUT REVISED AT MASTER PLAN BY THE DATE DETERMINED BY THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. TO SUPPORT DISTRICTS TRANSITION TO THIS NEW STUDENT CENTER FUNDING FORMULA THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE MILLION PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND. TO ENSURE THAT NO DISTRICT RECEIVES LESS RELATIVE TO THE CURRENT APPORTIONMENT A FUNDING FORMULA AND SO THERE ARE TWO COMPONENTS TO THIS HOLD HARMLESS. AFTER THE FIRST YEAR OF IMPLEMENTATION WHICH WOULD BE AN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN EACH DISTRICT WOULD RECEIVE NO LESS THAN THE TOTAL APPORTIONMENT FUNDING THAT THE DISTRICT RECEIVED AND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN. EACH YEAR THERE AFTER THE HOLD HARMLESS WILL BE CALCULATED BY MULTIPLYING THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN PURSUED AT RATES TIMES THE ABBOTT DISTRICTS ENROLLMENT. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO INCLUDES A HUNDRED AND SIXTY ONE POINT TWO MILLION PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND FOR TWO POINT FIVE ONE COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENTS. THESE FUNDS WOULD BE BUILT INTO THE BASE RATES OF THE PROPOSED A FUNDING FORMULA. AND PROVIDE ADDITIONAL BASE RESOURCES FOR DISTRICTS. AND FINALLY A NOTE ON CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS AT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET CALLS ON THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE TO CONSULT WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO DEVELOP A PROPOSAL FOR CONSIDERATION. WITHIN THE MAY REVISIONS THAT WOULD CONSOLIDATE CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS AND AND THE GOAL HERE IS REALLY TO CREATE A MORE FLEXIBILITY FLEXIBILITY WE OFTEN HEAR. THAT THERE'S A NEED AYE FOR MORE FLEXIBILITY SO COLLEGES ARE ABLE TO BEST A DEPLOY THE RESOURCES I TO MEET THEIR. LOCAL NEEDS THE MOST EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY WAY POSSIBLE SO AND THAT THAT'S ANOTHER COMPONENT OF OF THE BROADER AND FRAMEWORK. AND I THINK YOU ARE HERE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU LA. GOOD AFTERNOON NETWORK BROUGHT WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. AND I THINK THIS IS AN ISSUE IT DESCRIPTIVE AT THAT ADMINISTER THAT THE LEGISLATURE'S HAD A SIGNIFICANT TRISTEN NAME A NUMBER OF ANGLES. I'M FIRST OF THE CHAIRMAN JIM THERE IS INTERESTING AND NOT REFORMING THE FUNDING FORMULA AND THE LEGISLATURE AFTER OFFICE TO. LOOK AT THE FUNDING AND SERVICES FOR FIRST GENERATION AND LOW INCOME. I'M. SERVICES THAT THEY ARE IN DIRE COMMITTEE BECAUSE BUT ALSO TO YOU SEE SEAT AT THE IF YOU SYSTEM. AND OUR OFFICE PUBLISHED A REPORT IN LATE DECEMBER THAT. LAID OUT FOR THE COMMITTEE COLLEGES TO OPTIONS FOR REFORM THAT INCLUDE A WE DID STERN FORMULA AURA. AND CONSOLIDATED CONSOLIDATING CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS INTO A BLOCK GRANT. AND THERE ALSO HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS. OUR EFFORTS NOT ON THE FUNDING SITE BUT IN THE INTEREST OF IMPROVING STUDENT OUTCOMES OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS. AND I'M WE DO OUR HAND OUT THOSE PASSED A TWO AND ON PAGE TWO OF THAT HAND OUT WE WALKED THROUGH MANY OF THE. RECENT STUDENTS THAT SUPPORT EFFORTS I'M BEGINNING WITH THAT THE STUDENT SUCCESS TASK FORCE AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE TRIPLETS BEFORE THEM THE STUDENTS ACROSS IN SPORT PROGRAM. SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN FUNDING FOR BASIC SKILLS TO IMPROVE REMEDIATION EFFORTS. I'M THE LEGISLATURE ALSO I'M A TOOK ACTION TO. CREATE THE ASSOCIATE DEGREE FOR TRANSFER AREN'T TO STREAMLINE THE PROCESS OF TRANSFERRED FROM THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO THE CSU SYSTEM SO. A LOT OF INTEREST IN THIS AREA IN A NUMBER OF WAYS. I'M. I WOULD AND INCOMES OR HAND ARE BUT IF YOU MOVE TO PAGE FIVE I THINK THE MISTRESS TO WALK THROUGH THAT. THE COMPONENTS OF THE PROPOSAL. INSUFFICIENT DETAIL I THINK ARE JUST. I'M IN TERMS OF OUR OVERALL PERSPECTIVE I DO THINK WE WE THINK IT. PARA WE DO RECOMMEND MOVING TO AN APPROACH THAT HAS A CHANGE OF THE FUNDING FOR ME TO INCLUDE A PERFORMANCE BASED COMPONENT. I'M SO MUCH OF ADMINISTRATION. I THINK. WE SHARE MANY OF THE SAME CONCERNS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS WITH REGARDS TO THE COURT ENROLLMENT BASED. APPROACH WHICH. IN MANY WAYS INHIBIT SOME INNOVATION BY. BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT MANY OF THE REFORMS THAT WE WANT TO BLACKS YOU. COULD RESULT IN FEWER. UNITS BEING TAKEN BY STUDENTS SO I'M WE WE WE SERVE THOSE CONCERNS AND WE THINK ALSO THAT THE. ARAB PROVIDING THAT THIS PROBLEM AT THE FUNDING COMPONENT REALLY OUTLINES ARE A LOT OF THE THE FUNDING FROM THAT SOLVE TO MANY OF THE GOALS THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS FOR THE SYSTEM IN TERMS OF. IMPROVING OUTOMES. AND. IT AN IMPROVING THOSE IN A MORE TIMELY MANNER. WE DID LOOK AT WHAT THE RESEARCH SHOWS BECAUSE THERE ARE MORE THAN THIRTY STATES ARM WHO DO HAVE SOME PERFORMANCE BASED FUNDING IN THE HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEMS. NUMBER THAT RESEARCH SHOWS THAT IN GENERAL I'M. OF THERE'S A CORRELATION BETWEEN CHANGING YOUR FUNDING FORMULA TO A PERFRMANCE BASED ARE FUNDING APPROACH AND SING INSTITUTIONAL CHANGES MANY OF WHICH I THINK WE WOULD CONSIDER. THE KINDS OF CHANGES THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN WANTING TO SEE OF THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS THINGS LIKE. I'M CHANGING ARE THE YOUR APPROACH TO TO REMEDIATION TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES FOR BASIC SKILLS PROGRAMS. I'M PROVIDING ADDITIONAL ADVISING IN SUPPORT STUDENTS SO THAT ARE MEANT TO HELP GET THEM THROUGH THE SYSTEM M. DROP OPENS PROGRAMS THINGS LIKE THAT. NUMBER DESPITE THOSE CHANGES IN BEHAVIOR THAT THE RESEARCH DOESN'T SHOW A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN. INSTANT OUTCOMES WOULD THINK WE WE MEANT TO ADJUST THE STATE THIS IN AND OF ITSELF IS NOT IS NOT GONNA BE SUFFICIENT TO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES BUT WE THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT. THAT IS WORTH PURSUING BECAUSE IT DOES HELP ONLINE THE GOAL THAT WE HAVE FOR THE SYSTEM WITH WITH VOTE THE FUNDING APPROACH. I'M. THERE ARE THERE A COUPLE OF KEY THINGS IN UP AT SIX O'CLOCK OR SOME OF THE KEY ISSUES THAT WE HAVE WITH THE SPECIFIC COMPONENTS OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. FIRST IN TERMS OF THE THOSE OUTCOMES BASED. COMPONENT IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE. THE THE INCENTIVES THAT THEY COULD CREATE UNTIL THE FIRST IS RELATED TO. TO LOW INCOME STUDENTS AND OTHER STUDENTS WHO ARE. WHO COME INTO THE SYSTEM? WE LEFT PREPARED IF LIKELY TO IT TO COME OUT OF THE SYSTEM. I'M THE FORMULA CREATES AN INCENTIVE TO ENROLL MORE OF THE STUDENTS BECAUSE THERE'S A SPECIFIC COMPONENT FOR. A GOING CONCERN COUNTS BUT THERE ISN'T A SPECIFIC INCENTIVE TO HELP STUDENTS TO COMPLETE THEIR DEGREE ERA OR. CERTIFICATE OR TO TRANSFER IN A TIMELY MANNER THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE SEEN IN OTHER IN OTHER STATES WHEN THEY'VE ADOPTED THESE. THESE KINDS OF FORMULAS ARM THAT OFTENTIMES ARE COLLEGES MIGHT CHOOSE TO FOR EXAMPLE FOCUS ON STUDENTS ONE OF THE MOST PREPARED BECAUSE THEY MIGHT FIND IT TO BE MORE COST EFFECTIVE WAY OF IMPROVING THEIR OUTCOME. SO WE THINK ONE WAY DEBT TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE IS TO PROVIDE DIFFERENCE ALL A FUNDING SO THAT YOU PROVIDE HIGHER OUTCOMES BASED FUNDING. FOR. FOR THE OUTCOMES OF LOW INCOME STUDENTS. BUT SIMILARLY WE WEREN'T WE SAW THE RESEARCH OF CONCERNS ON ON THE. AND SOME COLLEGE OF MOVING TO MORE SHORT TERM. CERTIFICATE PROGRAMS AS BECAUSE THOSE ARE CHEAPER YOU ACTED TO PRODUCE OUTCOMES TO IMPROVE INCREASE YOUR FUNDING. IT'S I THINK AGAIN WE THINK OF ONE ONE THING FOR YOU TO CONSIDER IS ARE MAKING A INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF OCCAM'S YOU PROVIDE FOR SOME OF THOSE. HIGH COST PROGRAMS FOR EXAMPLE SOME OF CITY PROGRAMS THAT MAY BE A MORE EXPENSIVE FOR COLLEGES. TO OPERATE BUT BUT WE THINK ARE ARE ARE PROVIDED A SIGNIFICANT STATEWIDE VALUE. THE THE THE OTHER ISSUE THAT COMES UP THAT WE THINK ERA CAN BE A THOUGHT BY MONITORING ERA IS IS THIS CONCERN THAT THERE MIGHT BE INFLATION UPGRADES OF COLLEGES. KNOW THAT THEY WILL BE REWARDED BY GETTING STUDENTS UP THE DOOR IS SOMETHING THAT WE'VE WE'VE HEARD IN OTHER STATES AS A CONCERN THERE IS ENOUGH EARLY STRONG EVIDENCE THAT IT'S HAPPENING BUT WE DO THINK SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN. ADDRESS BY HAVING ADDITIONAL MONITORING. AND THEN FINALLY ON THE ISSUE OF OF THE CONSOLIDATING OUR ORDERED DEALING WITH THEIR OTHER THE CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS WHICH REPRESENT. ABOUT A QUARTER OF COMMUNICATIVE NINETY FUNDING WE DO THINK THAT IT'S BONTA CONSIDER THOSE PROGRAMS IN TANDEM WITH THE SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING THAT'S PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED FORMULA. BOTH OF THOSE FORMULAS ARE BOTH TRYING TO PROVIDED ADDITIONAL FUNDING IN RECOGNITION THAT THERE ARE SOME STUDENTS IN THE SYSTEM THAT NEED ADDITIONAL SUPPORT. AND WE THINK THERE'S A BIT OF A DISCONNECT RIGHT NOW WITH ONE FUNDING STREAM THAT'S A VERY FLEXIBLE ARE VERY FEW REQUIREMENTS AND IN THE CATEGORICAL AS WITH A LOT OF RESTRICTIONS. ARE A BUNCH OF VERY DIFFERENT PROGRAMS FOR VERY SPECIFIC PURPOSES. SO IN TERMS OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS I'M WE DO RECOMMEND YEAH I'M SHIFTING OUR APPROACH. AND AND WE THINK I'M THERE'S NO SORT OF. EXACTLY HARDER FAST RULE FOR WHAT WE THINK MAKES SENSE BUT WE DO THINK THERE. THE GOVERNOR'S APPROACH OF. SHIFTING TO ONLY HALF OF THE FORMULA BEING BASED ON ENROLLMENT IS REASONABLE. WE ALSO THINK THAT PROVIDING I'M FUNDING BASED ON OUR PERFORMANCE WE'VE YOU WANTED TO KEEP IT IS SUBSTANTIAL SO THAT YOU HAVE SUFFICIENT INCENTIVES FOR COLLEGES WE THINK. BASED ON WHAT WE'VE SEEN THE RESEARCH THAT TWENTY PERCENT OR MORE. IS IS IS SUFFICIENT TO ENSURE THAT THE CASE. I'M AS I MENTIONED WE DO RECOMMEND THAT YOU THAT THAT THE OUTCOMES BASED COMPONENTS BETWEEN SO THAT YOU PROVIDING MORE OUTCOME MORE FUNDING FOR OUTCOMES FOR LOW INCOME STUDENTS. AND FOR A MORE EXPENSIVE HIGH VALUE PROGRAMS. I'M AND THEN IN TERMS OF THE CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS WE WOULD RECOMMEND LOOKING AT THE CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS AND THE SUPPLEMENTAL GRANTS TOGETHER. COLLAPSING THEM INTO ONE LARGER. POT THAT WOULD BE ABOUT THE LEGISLATURE COULD SPECIFY THAT THE STUDENTS THAT. THAT YEAR INTENDING TO SERVE WITHOUT AMOUNT AND THEN HAVE FEW STRINGS BUT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS IN TERMS OF HOW THAT FUNDING. IS BEING SPENT AT EACH COLLEGE I'M. AND FINALLY WE WE DO RECOMMEND MONITORING A COUPLE ASPECTS TO ENSURE THAT THE SYSTEM IS BEING IMPLEMENTED AS INTENDED. MONITORING A NEW PROGRAM OR AT THE NEW PROGRAMS THAT ARE CREATED TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE NOT SERVE ONLY FOCUS ON THE SHORT TERM PROGRAMS. MONITOR GREAT RELATED DATA TO IT TO MONITOR TO SEE IF THERE IS ANY KIND OF GRADE INFLATION. AND. MONITORING THE TYPES OF. DEGREES AND CERTIFICATES AWARDED TO SEE IF WE ARE. SEEING A DIFFERENCE IN THAT THE KINDS OF PROGRAMS THAT ARE BEING. PRIORITIZE BY COLLEGES. SO DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER THE QUESTION. THANK YOU MANY COLLEGES CHRISTOS MANY OF US CHANCELLOR FOR THEIR TELL PARTICULARLY COLLEGES. BUT. I HAVE A HANDOUT THAT WE'VE PASSED OUT TOO MANY OF THE SLIDES COVER MUCH OF THE GROUND THAT WAS COVERED BY THE OTHER PRISONERS ALL MOVE QUICKLY THROUGH THEM. BOB TO BEGIN I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR WE SUPPORT THE FRAMEWORK PROPOSED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WE THINK THERE ARE WAYS WE CAN PROVE THE FORMULA ITSELF. AND WE AGREE WITH MANY OF THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S RECOMMENDATIONS BUT I'LL TALK TO YOU MORE OF OUR THOUGHTS AS WE MOVE ALONG. I JUST TO BE CLEAR AS WE. TALK ABOUT COMMUNITY COLLEGE FINANCE ALL THE TALKING BOTH ABOUT THE GENERAL PORTION FORMULA AND ABOUT CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS. SO PAGE TWO COVERS OUR CURRENT PRACTICE AGAIN AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. EXPLAIN THIS WELL WE FUNDED GENERAL PORSCHE MEANT BASED ON A COMBINATION OF STATE FUNDS PROPERTY TAXES AND ENROLLMENT FEES DISTRICTS RECEIVE THOSE FUNDS CURRENTLY LARGELY ON THE BASIS OF FULL TIME EQUIVALENT STUDENTS ENROLLED. WE'VE GOT SOME FUNDING. IN THERE ALSO BASED ON THE NUMBER OF COLLEGES AND CENTERS IN A DISTRICT AS WELL SOME OTHER DISTRICT CHARACTERISTICS THE MOST PROMINENT IS. SOME ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR RURAL DISTRICTS. AND IN IN ADDITION TO THE GENERAL APPORTIONMENT WE FUND A CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS ABOUT A THIRD OF THE FUNDING IS FINANCE MENTIONED IS FOR THOSE PURPOSES. WE OFTEN TALK ABOUT STUDENT SERVICES CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS THINGS LIKE THE STUDENT SUCCESS IN SUPPORT PROGRAM STUDENT EQUITY PROGRAM. BASIC SKILLS BUT WE ALSO HAVE CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS FOR ECONOMIC AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS THE MOST PROMINENT ONE IS THE STRONG WORKFORCE PROGRAM YOU ALL CREATED. SEVERAL YEARS AGO A WE HAVE A DEFERRED MAINTENANCE INSTRUCTIONAL KIKWIT MAKE CATEGORICAL AND SO WE HAVE WE HAVE CATEGORICAL IS FOR A NUMBER OF PURPOSES. ON PAGE THREE. WE SHOW THE DATA THAT FINANCE REFERENCED SO WE HAVE ABOUT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE GENERAL APPORTIONMENT WHEN YOU TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE STATE FUNDS THE PROPERTY TAXES IN THE STUDENT FEES. THE REMAINDER OF FUNDING. ABOUT ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN IS IN THE FORM OF CATEGORICAL FUNDS. PAGE FOUR IS THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AGAIN WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS YOU KNOW I THINK. THE VISION FOR SUCCESS HIGHLIGHTS. BUT THE CHALLENGES WE SEE IN THE SYSTEM I THINK IT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE ARE. YOU KNOW WE THINK WE HAVE IT OUR BOARD HAS ACKNOWLEDGED. THE CHALLENGES COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS FACE MOST STUDENTS DON'T. ATTAINED A DEGREE OR CERTIFICATE OR TRANSFER THOSE THAT DO TAKE A LONG TIME TO DO SO AND WE SEE GAPS BOTH ACROSS STUDENT GROUPS ACROSS REGIONS. AND THEN WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE PRINT PERVERSE INCENTIVES ESPECIALLY WHEN THE ECONOMIC AND DEMOGRAPHIC TRENDS THAT WE TYPICALLY ASSOCIATE WITH COMMUNITY COLLEGE ENROLLMENT. THINGS LIKE HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION ARMS. CLASS SIZES AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS WHEN THOSE. TRANSMIT ENROLLMENT GROWTH DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE. SOME PAGE FIVE. MMHM THIS IS OUR ATTEMPT TO MAKE EXPLICIT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH THE FOREIGN LET ME THINK ABOUT THREE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING. BOB ONE OF THEM IS ENCOURAGING PROGRESS TOWARDS THE VISION FOR SUCCESS IN THIS IS. YOU KNOW I THINK THE THEORY OF ACTION THAT DRIVES WHAT MOST PEOPLE THINK OF AS PERFORMANCE SPACE THROUGHOUT COME SPACE FUNDING. THAT WE ARE TRYING TO THROUGH A VARIETY OF MECHANISMS ENCOURAGE BETTER INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE. BUT I THINK THE SECOND PART IS I THINK WHAT MAKES THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AND AND THE FRAMEWORK THAT WE THINK MAKE SOUNDS A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN TRADITIONAL OUTCOME SPACE FUNDING THAT. MORE LIKE THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA WE THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO ALLOCATE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ARM. BASED ON CHARACTERISTICS OF STUDENTS THAT SUGGESTS THAT THEY FACE ESPECIALLY HIGH BARRIERS TO SUCCESS. I MEAN WE THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO ALLOCATE A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OF THE FUNDING BASED ON THAT. AND THEN AT PRINCIPLE THAT WE. THINK IS IMPORTANT AND CERTAINLY I THINK THE INSTITUTIONS THINK IS IMPORTANT. HAS THAT MOVING FORWARD FUNDING FOR THOSE NEED TO BE STABLE AND PREDICTABLE BUT ALSO. PROVIDE THEM WITH FLEXIBILITY TO TO MAKE THE KINDS OF CHANGES NECESSARY TO SUCCEED IN THIS ENVIRONMENT. THE MEN THAT SECOND BULLET IS INTENDED TO HIGHLIGHT I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE THINKING THROUGH AS WE MOVE THROUGH THIS PROCESS. IS HOW DO THE TYPES OF THE WAYS IN WHICH WE DESIGNED A NEW FUNDING FORMULA ALIGNED WITH THE OTHER TYPES OF INITIATIVES THAT WE'VE. THAT WE'VE UNDERTAKEN IN RECENT YEARS YOU KNOW GUIDED PATHWAYS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS PREVIOUSLY IS THE WAY IN WHICH WE SEEK TO. ALLY AND A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT STUDENT SUCCESS INITIATIVES IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES TOGETHER GUIDED PATHWAYS SUGGESTS THAT WE SHOULD UPON A STUDENT CENTURY UNDERSTAND THEIR EDUCATIONAL GOAL. PUT THEM ON A PATHWAY THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH THAT GOAL AND PROVIDE THEM WITH THE SUPPORT THEY NEED TO GET BETTER AND SO I THINK. YOU KNOW UNDER GUIDED PATHWAYS WE HAVE A SET OF KEY INDICATORS THAT WE THINK ARE IMPORTANT A MONITOR. PIECE OR THINGS LIKE A COMPLETION OF TRANSFER LEVEL MATH AND ENGLISH IN THE FIRST YEAR AS A WAY IN WHICH WE THINK. WE ARE PUTTING STUDENTS ON A BETTER PATH TO SUCCESS WERE WORKING THROUGH THOSE TYPES OF ISSUES. AS WE THINK THROUGH THE FUNDING FORMULA AND SO OBVIOUSLY THAT INCLUDES BASIC SKILLS REFORM BUT IT ALSO INCLUDES A LOT OF THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING A STRONG WORKFORCE PROGRAM TO RECOGNIZE NOT ONLY TRANSFER OUTCOMES. BUT ALSO ABOUT CAREER OUTCOMES. SO THE NEXT SLIDE TALKS ABOUT. THE DIFFERENT WAYS IN WHICH WE HAVE ENGAGED IN THIS PROPOSAL SENSE OF THE RELEASE OF THE JANUARY BUDGET. SO IN JANUARY. WASH ALL ALL BEGIN BY SAYING THAT WE HAVE A STANDING ADVISORY WORK GROUP ON FISCAL AFFAIRS. THIS IS A GROUP THAT LARGELY CONSISTS OF CHIEF BUSINESS OFFICIALS FROM A VARIETY OF DISTRICTS THAT REPRESENT ADAM SOME OF THE DIVERSITY IN OUR SYSTEM. AND THIS CONVERSATION BEGAN LAST YEAR A LARGELY IN THE CONTEXT OF THE ENROLLMENT CHALLENGES THAT THAT COLLEGES WERE FACING. BUT ALSO. GIVEN THE OF THE ADOPTION OF THE VISION FOR SUCCESS BY OUR BOARD OF GOVERNORS SO THIS CONVERSATION IN OUR SYSTEM BEGAN UP PRIOR TO THE RELEASE OF THE JANUARY BUDGET. OF THAT GROUP HAS CONTINUED TO THINK THROUGH WHAT IS THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL MEAN FOR THE SYSTEM. BOB UPON RELEASE OF BIRD JANUARY BUDGET. CHANCELLOR OAK WE ASK THE PRESIDENT OF. WE GET A POLICE CEO BOARD TO CONVENE A WORKGROUP TED TO CONSIDER THE PROPOSAL AMANAT BACK GROUP HAS BEEN MEETING THROUGHOUT. OVER THE PERIOD OF TIME SINCE THE RELEASE OF THE BUDGET. WE HAVE A CONSULTATION COUNCIL WHICH ARM. IS ESTABLISHED UP PURSUANT TO EXISTING LAW BUT INCLUDE STAKEHOLDERS FROM ACROSS THE SYSTEM ADMINISTRATORS FACULTY STAFF STUDENTS AND OTHERS. BOB THAT HAVE BEEN REVIEWING IT OF THIS PROPOSAL UP THERE MEETINGS BOTH IN FEBRUARY AND MARCH. BUT THE CAMPAIGN FOR COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY WE HELD A SERIES OF EVENTS FOCUSED ON. HOW DO WE THINK ABOUT EQUITY IN THE CONVERSATION? AROUND IN THE FUNDING FORMULA AND HOW DO WE. ENCOURAGE OUR GOALS AROUND EQUITY UP THROUGH THIS CONVERSATION AND THAT WE'VE DISTRIBUTED TO SURVEYS ONE ON THE FUNDING FORMULA AND ONE ON CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS TO OUT TO GET ADDITIONAL FEEDBACK IN FOR BOTH OF THOSE HE RECEIVED. HUNDREDS OF RESPONSES. AND SO IS WORTH BANKING THROUGH OUR NEXT STEPS I THINK WE ARE PLANNING TO TAKE THE FEEDBACK THAT WE'VE HEARD OF THE FEEDBACK FROM THE LEADERSHIP IN OUR OFFICE FROM OUR BOARD OF GOVERNORS. TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO THEM ABOUT THE ADMINISTRATION FOR THE MAY REVISION AND SO WE THINK THAT THE MAYOR VISION IS A PLACE WHERE WE CAN BEGIN TO. ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE'VE HEARD. THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS. I TRY TO INCLUDE SOME QUESTIONS HERE THAT REFLECT ADAM SOME OF THE WAYS OF SOME OF THE THOUGHTS THAT HAVE EMERGED IN SOME OF THE WAYS OF ORGANIZING THIS CONVERSATION. AND SO AGAIN YOU KNOW WE AGREE WITH THE GOVERNOR THAT THE FORMULA SHOULD RECOGNIZE ACCESS SUCCESS IN OUTCOMES. AND SO AS WE MOVE FORWARD HOW MUCH EMPHASIS SHOULD BE PLACED ON EACH OF THE THREE COMPONENTS OF THAT PROPOSAL. AND SO ONE OF THE AREAS THAT THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE SUGGESTED WE USE THE SHORTHAND OF ABOUT HALF OF THE MONEY GOING OUT BASED ON ACT. BASED ON ENROLLMENT ABOUT A QUARTER BASED ON THESE MEASURES OF STUDENT NEED AND THE FINAL QUARTER BASED ON OUTCOMES. YOU KNOW I THINK WE'RE HAVING A CONVERSATION ABOUT BY A WHAT'S THE RIGHT BALANCE THERE. THE SECOND BULLET ASKS YOU KNOW IN A FUNDING FORMULA THAT PROVIDES RESOURCES HAVE FOR ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR SPOUSE CERTAIN GROUPS OF STUDENTS. WHAT CHARACTERISTICS ABOUT MIGHT WE CONSIDER AND I THINK THE CONVERSATION WE'VE BEEN HAVING THEIR IS OTHER CHARACTERISTICS THAT ARE NOT RELATED TO FINANCIAL NEED? VETERANS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO LOOK AT. OTHER THIRD IS AROUND KIND OF IMPROVED OUTCOMES TO GET OUT OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL USES DEGREES AND CERTIFICATES ARE THERE OTHER OUTCOMES PARTICULARLY OUTCOMES RELATED TO PROGRESSION THAT WE MIGHT WANT TO ALSO CONSIDER IS THE BASIS FOR FUNDING. A FOURTH OF WITH REGARD TO STABILITY HOW MUCH YEAR OVER YEAR CHANGE ARE WE COMFORTABLE IN A DAY FOR FORMULA. AND THEN FINALLY AS WE TRANSITION TO A NEW FORMULA WHAT PERIOD OF TIME IS APPROPRIATE WHAT TYPE OF HOLD HARMLESS TO WE NEED TO A DESIGN WAS THAT LOOK LIKE AND WHAT KIND OF CAPACITY DO WE NEED IN THE SHORT TERM. SO I'M HAPPY TO TALK THROUGH THE WAYS IN WHICH SOME OF THE GROUPS. YOU KNOW HAVE TALKED TO THAT. IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN THEM HAVE QUESTIONS. SO JUST ABOUT TO CLOSE YOU KNOW I THINK YOU KNOW. ONE OF THE THINGS WE WANT TO BE MINDFUL OF IS THAT A NEW FORMULA DE IN OUR MIND IS INTENDED TO ENCOURAGE CHANGES THE OTHER CAMPUSES AND SO. WE NEED TO THINK THROUGH HOW WE ARE CHOOSE TO IMPLEMENT THIS. OBVIOUSLY CHANGES IN STATUTE WOULD REQUIRE CHANGES IN OUR SYSTEMS POLICIES THAT OUR APPORTIONMENT SYSTEMS. AND THEN REQUIRE US TO COMMUNICATE THOSE WITH OUR COLLEGES BUT I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT WE THINK ABOUT THE TYPE OF ACTIVITIES THAT WE SHOULD BE TAKING THE TYPE OF CAPACITY BUILDING THAT WE SHOULD BE DOING. TO ENCOURAGE A COLLEGE IS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE INCENTIVES THAT ARE CREATED IN THE NEW SYSTEM. AND THEN OBVIOUSLY WE'RE MAKING A SET OF HYPOTHESES THAT THESE TYPES OF POLICY CHANGES WILL RESULT IN IMPROVED OUTCOMES AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WE EVALUATE THE FACTS OF THOSE IN THE COMING YEARS. AND MAKE ADJUSTMENTS AND SO THAT INCLUDES. WORKING WITH YOU ALL IN COMING YEARS TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE WERE FIND THE FORMULA. TO DO WHAT WE WANTED STIFF. AND WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS. OKAY. QUESTIONS FIRST OF ALL WE'RE NOT TAKING THE ROLE TODAY THIS IS A JOINT INFORMATIONAL HEARING. AND ALSO AND KNOW TO THE TO THE PUBLIC THAT WE DID TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS ISSUE REMEMBER LAST TIME BUT IF IF YOU'RE SO INSPIRED TO WANT TO. ENGAGE AGAIN AT THAT AT THE END WE WILL. WE WILL. OBLIGED FIRST WILL START WITH QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS OUT OF A FEW BUT OPENED UP TO. MY OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS. OKAY SURE SO ON I THINK A FEW QUESTIONS AND AND FOR THOSE MAY BE IN THE AUDIENCE OR OR ON OR NOT. AND IT WAS THE INTENT OF OF THE LEGISLATURE WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT THIS HAVE AN ADOPTED YET BUT COME OUR FEEDBACK. AND THAT MAY BE GIVE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE PERMANENT FINANCED IT TO CLARIFY. THAT SOME OF THE OTHER COMMUNITY COLLEGE SMALLER CATEGORICAL STATE. THE. HE AT THAT POINT DAY AND NAY SAYER PIANISSIMO JOB THAT WE WERE NOT CAN YOU DID DISABILITY PROGRAMS WE WERE NOT CONSIDERING THOSE TO BE PART OF THIS FUNDING FORMULA. SO THAT IS IS THAT IS THAT CORRECT. AND SO THERE'S TWO COMPONENTS SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND TERMS OF AT CHANGING THE FUNDING FORMULA APPLIES ONLY TO GENERAL PURPOSE PORTION MEN'S. WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET CALLS FOR IS FOR THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE TO ENGAGE WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND SEE OF HIS OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN THE CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS TO? PROVIDE MORE FLEXIBILITY AS WE DON'T HAVE ANY AT AT THIS POINT WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT SPECIFIC CATEGORIC WAS YOU WANNA HEAR FEEDBACK FAIR CHANCE HIS OFFICE MAYBE COMMITTEE COLLEGES CAN CLARIFY BUT AS WHEN I. MAKE SURE THAT WE KNOW THAT THAT WE SO FAR HAVE THAT. THE IN ITS COLLECTIVE INTENT THAT WE WILL MAKE SURE THAT CLARIFY THAT'S NOT PART OF THE DISCUSSION MEAN LOOKING AT THE THREE BIG POTS OF MAYBE YES SO I THINK YOU KNOW. THE GOVERNOR'S REQUEST WAS LOOK AT CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS OUT WE HAVE NOT HEARD SUGGESTIONS BUT THOSE ARE PLACES THAT WE SHOULD LOOK. OUT TO YOUR POINT WE'VE BEEN FOCUSING ON THE STUDENT. SUCCESS IN SUPPORT PROGRAM THE STUDENT EQUITY PROGRAM AND THE BASIC SKILLS INITIATIVE WHICH ARE SIZE WILL. AMOUNTS OF MONEY THAT WE THINK. WE CAN CHANGE INCENTIVES THERE. THERE AND AND THAT BE THE THAT WHAT THE PROPOSAL THAT WE SEND OUR THE RECOMMENDATION WE SEND BACK WITH PART OF FINANCES I THINK THE MESSAGE GOT NOW. WE DON'T SEE DOZENS OF THEM. KNOWLEDGE AND TWENTY STUDENTS IN THE AUDIENCE HERE TODAY SO. I THAT NUMBER ONE IN THE NUMBER TWO I I DO ASSUME THAT YOU'RE TAKING THIS COLLECTIVE FEEDBACK IN THE NAY REVISION YOU'LL TAKE THESE THINGS INTO CONSIDERATION WITH THAT REVISION FOR THE. WITH THAT REVISED PROPOSAL FOR THIS. SO I CAN SPEAK WITH CERTAINTY ON A WELL ONLY NOW BEING HEARD AND. YOU KNOW INCLUDE IN THE IN THE MAYOR VISION BUT WE ARE CERTAINLY ENGAGING THEM WITH STAKEHOLDERS WITH THE RECEIVING FEEDBACK ARE DEATHLY TAKING THAT INTO CONSIDERATION. OKAY. AND THEN AS FAR AS THE ON. THE HOLD HARMLESS ISSUE I KNOW I'VE HEARD FROM A FEW COMMUNITY COLLEGES NOT JUST. AND. IN IN MY DISTRICT UT FROM ACROSS THE STATE AND. AND I I THINK THAT. IS SOMETHING THAT THAT WE OUGHT TO TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT WE DID WITH LCF F.. THAT WE DIDN'T NECESSARILY PICK WINNERS AND LOSERS SOME MAY SAY NO WE'RE HAVING DEBATES IN K. TWELVE THAT THERE ARE THAT BITES. YOU KNOW AS WE GROW GOING FORWARD THE NEW REVENUES NOT AFTER ONE OR TWO YEARS. TO TEN SEE RE BAD SHOULD HAVE ONE OF THOSE DISTRICTS TAKEN A SIGNIFICANT. I HAD SO I THINK THAT'S THAT'S IMPORTANT. TO TO ME I THINK TO TO TO PICK SUBCOMMITTEE SO FAR SIDES WANNA MAKE SURE WE WE HAVE THAT. ON THE RECORD. AND THEN. AT AND THEN AT SO I THINK THE DEBATE IS WE KNOW WHAT WHAT BUCKETS OF. AB ANYWAY TALKING ABOUT THE GENERAL. KIND IT IMPORT CEMENT WHICH IS IN THE COMPARISON TRADE LIKE K. TWELVE. JUST MEAN UPPER PEOPLE. AND THEN LOOKING AT SOME TAPPED A DEMOGRAPHIC. CHARACTERISTICS INCOME AND THEN THE ARM AND THE. THE OUTCOME SPEAKS AND SO I KNOW THAT TWO CRITICISMS HAVE COME UP IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS I WANT TO GIVE BACK COMMUNITY COLLEGES THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO TO RESPOND. AND TO THOSE AND SO AS FAR AS THE OUTCOMES BASED. YOU KNOW ONE OF THAT ONE OF THE CRITICISMS IS THAT. IT WOULD JUST IT WOULD ESSENTIALLY BE AT M. ANALOGOUS TO WHAT HAPPENS IN K. TWELVE AND TESTING THAT. THAT. YOU KNOW YOUR REWARD SCHOOLS FOR. TESTING AND NOT TEACHING AND INCENTIVIZE IS DIFFERENT TACK BEHAVIOR IN THOSE. THOSE I ON OUTCOMES ARE OUT OF THAT SOMETIMES OUT OF THE REACH OF THE PEOPLE TO TEACH A CLASSROOM AND SO I'M YOU KNOW WE DON'T ALWAYS. PAY TEACHERS BY PERFORMANCE AND HOW THEY'RE YOU KNOW THE OUTCOMES OF OF THE STUDENTS. AND AND THEN TO IT IF YOU HAD SOME TYPE OF FORMULA BASED UPON. OUTCOMES COM YOU KNOW WOULD IT BE A DISADVANTAGE TO CERTAIN SCHOOLS THAT MAYBE DON'T HAVE THE BEST OUTCOMES. YOU KNOW THERE IS A HIGH ACHIEVING SCHOOL THAT HAS TREMENDOUS TRANSFER RATES AND. CERTIFICATES HOW ARE THEY GONNA BE REWARDED WITH THE WHOLE NOTION OF THIS IS WE WANT TO GIVE RESOURCES TO THE SCHOOLS. HAS STUDENTS WHO NEED THE MOST HELP SELL. MAYBE YOU CAN START OFF BY RESPONDING TO IT TO TO HAVE THAT OF THE CRITICISMS AS FAR AS. THE AT IMPLEMENTATION. SURE SO. ON THE CONCERNS ABOUT ALL OUT QUALITY I THINK AS AND THAT LEO MENTIONED. ME OF THE RESEARCH IS INCONCLUSIVE ON WHETHER OUT QUALITY ADD DECREASES AND. IT IN INSTANCES WHERE PERFORMANCE SPACE OUT BECAUSE HE'S FUNNY MODELS HAVE BEEN ADOPTED SO THERE'S STRONG EVIDENCE THAT FACULTY WILL NOT LOWER STANDARDS I THINK ONE OF THE. CONCERNS HAS BEEN BROUGHT UP IS SAYS INCREASE OF CERTIFICATES A SHORT TERM CERTIFICATES IN THE FUNNY MODEL AND WE'VE CRAFTED THE LANGUAGE THERE. TO ENSURE THAT THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE CONTINUES TO MONITOR AND. TO DEVELOP STANDARDS FOR THE AT METRICS ARE COUNTED AS PART OF THE OF THE FUNDING FORMULA WE HAVE BEEN TAKING FEEDBACK ON YOU KNOW THINKING THROUGH THOSE. POLITY ISSUES. IN TERMS OF SORT OF A FUNDING FORMULA PENALIZING AT COMMUNITY COLLEGES THAT THAT SERVE LOW INCOME STUDENTS. I THINK THE KEY IS REALLY FINDING THAT BALANCE I THINK WE WANNA HAVE A STRONG COMPONENT OF RESOURCES TO THOSE DISTRICTS THAT SERVED AND UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS SO WE CRAFTED. A FORMULA THAT TRAVIS TRIES TO STRIKE THAT BALANCE THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO DRECK RESOURCES TO THOSE COLLEGES THAT'S HURDLES POPULATIONS BUT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO CREATE THE INCENTIVES. TO TO FURTHER. THE STUDENT SUCCESS EFFORTS THAT ARE HAPPENING. AT THE COLLEGES SO WE'RE DEATHLY THINKING THROUGH THAT BALANCE AND ONE OF THE. COMET PIECES OF FEEDBACK HAS BEEN IS OUR WAY TO BETTER INCORPORATE EQUITY INTO THE STUDENT SUCCESS INCENTIVE GRANT TO WE ARE TAKING THAT INTO CONSIDERATION AS PART OF THIS A LARGER RESPONSE TO HOW DO WE ENSURE. THAT THE DISTRICTS A SERB. LOW INCOME POPULATIONS ARE RECEIVING IN THE RESOURCES AND ARE BEING REWARDED FOR. IMPROVING OUTCOMES FOR THOSE POPULATIONS. AND DAD CAN YOU GO BACK TO THE ISSUE THAT I RAISED EARLIER ABOUT THE. DISTRICTS CONCERNED ABOUT THE. GOING FORWARD THE NEW ENGLAND HOLDING HARMLESS. I'M OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEM. I SURE SO IT THINK THAT'S ANOTHER CONVERSATION THAT WE'VE BEEN YOU KNOW HEARING FEEDBACK ON. YOU KNOW AND THERE'S THERE'S AN ONGOING HOLD HARMLESS THAT WE PROPOSE AND THERE'S. IN US THERE'S VARIOUS COMPONENTS TO THAT BUT I'M IN THINKING THROUGH THE TRANSITION TO THE NEW FORMULA WE THINK THAT AS FEES RATES INCREASE THAT THOSE DISTRICTS THAT WOULD BE HELD HARMLESS IN THE FIRST YEARS. WOULD QUICKLY TRANSITION INTO. AT THE NEW FORMULA THAT THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ARE DEATHLY LOOKING INTO THAT TRANSITION PERIOD BUT OF THE GOAL IS REALLY TO HAVE DISTRICTS MOVED TO THE CITY A FUNDING FORMULA AND YOU ALLOCATION. AWAY FROM THE HOLD HARMLESS SO THAT BE JUST THROUGH THAT FIRST COUPLE YEARS OF A TRANSITION AND THEN YOU WOULD RIVER. TO THAT TO THE NEW FORMULA POURED. ALL GOING FORWARD NEW MONEY SOAK. NEW MONEY WOULD BE PART OF THAT NEW FORMULA AT THE HOLD HARMLESS IS AN ON GOING HOME HOLD HARMLESS THAT IS TIED TO SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN. PURSUED AND RATES. IF I'D JUST ON THE OUTCOMES PART OF THIS SITE I DO WANT TO SEE YOU KNOW I THINK. PART OF THE CONVERSATION WE'RE HAVING A CERTAIN ABOUT HOW DO WE STRIKE A BALANCE ACROSS A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT VALUES. I THINK THE POINT OF THE VISION FOR SUCCESS OR ONE OF THE. KEY PARTS OF THE VISION FOR SUCCESS IS AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THAT OUR OUTCOMES TODAY ARE WHERE WE WOULD LIKE THEM TO BE SO I THINK. A GREATER EMPHASIS ON OUTCOMES IN OUR MIND IT I THINK IS A WELCOME PART OF THIS FORMULA WHEN PEOPLE TALK ABOUT. GUIDED PATHWAYS THE METAPHOR. FOLKS OFTEN USES. MOVING FROM A CAFETERIA STYLE. COMMUNITY COLLEGE EXPERIENCE WHERE THE PRIMARY VALUE IS ON BROAD ACCESS TO A VARIETY OF COURSES. SHIFTING INTO A MORE FOCUS PATHWAY WHERE STUDENTS ARE GIVEN OR ARE ASKED WHAT THEIR EDUCATIONAL GOALS ARE AND ARE GIVEN A DIRECTION. TO GET THERE AND SO I THINK. YOU KNOW I THINK WE WE WILL NEED TO SEE IF A. PUTTING THIS IN A FUNDING FORMULA TAKES US FAR LEADS TO. UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES BUT I THINK. YOU KNOW PART OF THIS IS. ALL WHINING OUR FUNDING SYSTEM WITH THE EXPECTATIONS WE'VE SET OUT. TO THE POINT ABOUT. ACCESS FOR ON YOU KNOW STUDENTS WHO HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN UNDERSERVED OR WHOSE CHARACTERISTICS SUGGEST THAT. THAT THEY WOULD HAVE A HARDER TIME MEETING THE OUTCOMES THAT WE. INCLUDING A FORMULA YOU KNOW I THINK THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S NOTED THAT ONE WAY YOU CAN DESIGN A FORMULA AND IN A PLACE WHERE WE'VE SEEN SOME PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE IN OTHER STATES THAT THIS HELPS TO ALLEVIATE THOSE CONCERNS. IS BY. INCLUDING ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR THE OUTCOMES ATTRIBUTABLE TO CERTAIN GROUPS AND SO LOOKING AT. DEGREES EARNED A BY LOW INCOME STUDENTS I THINK THAT'S A OR SOMETHING REASONABLE AND AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BE I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT INTERNALLY. WELL I WOULDA I WAS GONNA IMPLIED THAT THAT ISSUE ABOUT THE OUTCOMES OF THE GREAT NOW YOU SEE HIM LIKE THAT THAT THE DATA RUN THAT THAT THE DEPARTMENT FINANCED PRODUCED. YOU LOOKING AT OUTCOMES THAT ARE NOT CONTROLLING FOR THE DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS I THINK ONCE YOU'VE. DESIGNED A SYSTEM THAT DOES THAT I THINK YOU YOU THE. YEAR LOW UNIT YOU ELIMINATE THE ISSUE OF SERVE PENALIZING. GOT DISTRICTS THAT HAVE OUR POPULATIONS THAT ARE HARDER TO SERVE SO WE THINK THAT THE ONE. KEY WAY THAT YOU COULDN'T ADDRESS THAT COMPONENT. ON ON ON THE WHOLE ARE MUCH OF THE GETS ITS ACT. IF THE CHALLENGING ISSUE ON THE ONE HAND YOU WANT TO PROVIDE SOME STABILITY FOR. A NURSE FOR COLLEGES AND COMMITTEE BECAUSE DISTRICTS OF THE TRANSITIONING AT THE SAME TIME EVENTUALLY YOU DO WANT THIS TO MATTER BECAUSE THE WHOLE POINT IS THAT THE FORMULA FOR BOTH TO CREATE AN INCENTIVE. DIRECTED TO CHANGE BEHAVIOR AND SO I THINK THAT FOR A DIFFICULT TRADE OFF AND KIND OF FIGURE OUT HOW TO BALANCE THAT. PROVIDING SOME STABILITY WHAT THE SAME TIME ENSURING THAT THE THE FORMULA ITSELF. HAVE AN EFFECT I'M I'M ON BOOK COLLEGES RECEIVE. MISTER CHAVEZ. I'M A VERY INTRIGUED BY THIS WHOLE EFFORT WE'RE DOING HERE I THINK IT'S. THE LA TIMES STUDY LOOKING AT IT AND I'D LIKE TO. GOING BACK TO THE GOVERNOR'S PEOPLE. YOU KNOW WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES FARMS HOW MANY STUDENTS WHO ACTUALLY TRANSFERRED IS USE YOUR USUALLY. WE KNOW THAT THE. WHO? I THINK THE CAFETERIA MODEL YOU LAID OUT IS PROBABLY APPROPRIATE THAT PEOPLE TAKE A LOT OF THINGS BUT YOU KIND OF WONDER AND FOR WHAT AND TO WHAT END. MAKES YOU THINK BACK WHEN I WOULD TO A JUNIOR COLLEGE. BEFORE I BECAME A COMMITTEE COLLEGE WAS VERY SH SCRIPTED WITH THE IDEA THAT YOU WOULD GO THERE AND YOU WERE GOING TO TRANSFER TO A. SERIOUS YOU GET A PATHWAY HE HAS VERY CLEAR LOT A COUNSELING. SOMEWHERE I THINK WE GOT OFF THAT. YOU MENTIONED THAT DID. THAT THE CURRENT MODEL DISCOURAGES INNOVATION. THAT THE ECONOMICS OF THE STATE. WHEN WE HAVE OF ROBUST ECONOMY THE AROMA DROPS WE HAVE MORE MONEY BUT WE HAVE. STRUGGLING ECONOMY WITH PEOPLE TRYING TO RETRAIN. WE HAVE A DROP IN THE MONEY AND THAT'S WHY MORE PEOPLE THERE. SO THIS SHOULD. COULD ADDRESS IT. AND THEN YOU TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT IS ACTUALLY THE GOAL OF THE STATE AND THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM AND THAT WAS. EDUCATION. ARE PREPARED FOR WORKFORCE. I THINK DOES A REALLY GOOD POINT SOME WHY WE NEED TO DO THIS. I THINK. THERE'S SOME GOOD THINGS HERE. NOW AND. I DON'T THINK I HEARD A LOT OF DISCUSSION OR MAYBE YOU COULD TALK TO ME ABOUT. THE RURAL COMMUNITIES. I MAY LOSE SIGNIFICANT FUNDING I HAVE A QUESTION HERE. HOW DOESTHE ADMINISTRATION PLAN? TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS OF WORLD COMMUNITY COLLEGES. THEY EXPRESSED THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE RELEASING FUNDING. SO WHAT'S YOUR THOUGHT ABOUT RURAL KING COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND HOW WE'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE. CHRIS FORGET SOME OF FINANCE SO CERTAIN WE WE'VE HEARD THOSE SAME CONCERNS. CHAU AS WE'RE LOOKING AT DIFFERENT FACTORS AND FEEDBACK THAT WE'VE HEARD FROM THE FIELD. WILL CERTAINLY TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION I THINK ONE OF THE MOST COMMON ELEMENTS THAT WE'VE HEARD FROM WORLD COLLEGES TO CONSIDER. IF THERE'S A PARTICULAR COMPONENT UP REFERRED TO AS THE BASE ALLOCATION IN THE FORMULA. AND IF THAT. USING THE RIGHT BANDS AND THE RIGHT WAITS TO CAPTURE SOME OF THOSE BASIC NECESSITIES THAT AT THOSE TYPES OF COLLEGES. I'M SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'VE CERTAINLY HEARD FROM DISTRICTS AND SOMETHING THAT WERE CERTAINLY. CONSIDERING AND LOOKING UP. IT. I WOULD JUST ADD THAT I. YOU KNOW I THINK OFTEN WHEN WE ARE CONSIDERING HER BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN ENGAGED IN THIS PROCESS OF CONSIDERING A NEW FORMULA I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT A COMPARATIVE WHAT WE HAVE IN PLACE TODAY BUT I THINK. YOU KNOW A THE CHALLENGES THAT RURAL COMMUNITY SPACE ARE OFTEN CHALLENGES HAVE. YOU KNOW. INSUFFICIENT ECONOMIES OF SCALE THAT I THINK ARE SIMILAR CHALLENGES AND AND ENROLLMENT FUNDING SYSTEM AND I THINK YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT YOU KNOW. A SOME OF THESE CHALLENGES MIGHT BE ALLEVIATED IN A SYSTEM THAT ISN'T SO BASED ON C. TIME BUT IS BASED ON KINDS OF THE TYPES OF OUTCOMES. AND IN SOME CASES HERE I THINK DEPENDING ON HOW YOU DEFINE WHICH STUDENT GROUPS. ARE IMPORTANT TO. TARGETING A FORMULA I THINK YOU CAN ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS TO SO I THINK THIS IS. YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S FEEDBACK THAT WE'VE HEARD ALSO THAT WE HAVE. TAKEN YOU KNOW WE'RE TRYING TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT BUT I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD FUNDAMENTAL FUNDAMENTALLY IMAGINE THAT RURAL COMMUNITIES. WOULD DO WE WOULD HAVE TO ACCOMMODATE THEM IN AN INFORMAL I THINK IN MANY WAYS. THAT YOU KNOW WE CAN WE CAN DESIGN BENEFITS THAT ARE BETTER THAN WHAT OF THE CURRENT SYSTEM PROVIDES FOR SOME OF THESE COLLEGES. WHAT TYPE OF BENEFITS? WE THINK SO I THINK YOU KNOW THE TWO COMPONENTS YOU KNOW THERE'S OBVIOUSLY THIS ARE YOU KNOW THE PORTION OF THIS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION CALLS A BASE GRANT. YOU KNOW THIS. FINANCE SUGGESTED. THAT IS A COMBINATION OF PER FTE YES FUNDING AND. PER COLLEGE PER DISTRICT FUNDING SO I THINK. FIGURING OUT WHAT THE RELATIVE SHARE OF THOSE TWO PARTS OF THAT YOU KNOW ARE IMPORTANT COME. CONVERSATION I THINK AS WE THINK ABOUT THE SUPPLEMENTAL SIDE OF THIS THEN IT'S HOW DO YOU DEFINE. WHICH STUDENTS WERE TARGETING IN THE FORMULA AND I THINK ON THE OUTCOME SIDE OF THIS. I THINK WE NEED TO YOU KNOW PART OF THIS IS LOOKING AT WHAT IS THE RATIO OF THE COLLEGES OUTCOMES TO ITS. ENROLLMENT AND HOW DO WE YOU KNOW IN SOME CASES I'M CERTAIN. A CERTAIN OUTCOMES THAT WE CHOOSE OUR MIGHT ACTUALLY MAKE SENSE I MAKE MORE SENSE AND. CONNECT CONTEXT COMPARED TO ENROLLMENT. NOT JUST MY CONCERN IS YOU KNOW COMMUNITY COLLEGES BECAUSE YOU SEE. A REAL ECONOMIC ENGINES IN A COMMUNITY AND MANY TIMES IN THERE AND A RURAL AREAS. YOU KNOW THE. IN THOSE LOWER COST OF LIVING THEY OFTEN HAVE. STRUGGLING FOR JOBS AND THINGS SO. I JUST HAVE THAT CONCERNED ON THE ROAD COLLEGES. I'M NOT THE LA GO THEY HAVE THIS LAST BULLET HERE MONITOR IMPLEMENTATION DETERMINE IF NEGATIVE OUTCOMES. EMERGE HOW DO YOU SEE THAT. WHEN WILL YOU START SAY IN. HOW DID YOU GUYS CAN BE REPORTED BACK TO US ON THE IMPACT OF THIS DECISION? WHAT BINGO A LOT OF THE THE INFORMATION THAT WE ARE RECOMMENDING THE CHAPTERS OFFICE ALREADY COLLECT THAT INFORMATION AND AND? HAS IT AVAILABLE WHAT'S MORE ABOUT MINORING OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS AND I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF TIME TO THE DEPARTING RELEASED A FEW YEARS OF INFORMATION. TO COME TO GET A SENSE OF THERE'S A TREND GOING ON BUT I THINK IT'S JUST LOOKING AT THINGS LIKE ARE WE SEEING OF THIS CONCERN ABOUT SHIFTING TO SHORT TERM CERTIFICATES ARE WE SEEING THEIR THE SYSTEM AS A WHOLE. THERE'S BEEN A LOT OVEREMPHASIS ON THAT OR A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE ON THAT VERSUS OTHER. OTHER. AT DEGREES OR CERTIFICATES DO WE SEE OUR DIFFERENCES IN OUTCOMES FOR THE GROUND WITH WITH DIFFERENT UP PARTICULAR STUDENT GROUPS. I THINK IT'S IT'S NOW OF SOMETHING THAT WE THINK YOU'RE GONNA SAY FIND THE THE EXACT PROBLEM OF YUGOSLAVIA BUT MONITORING THAT DATA CAN HELP YOU GET A SENSE OF WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE SYSTEM. AS LONG AS ALSO OBVIOUSLY HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH. WITH COLLEGES ADMINISTRATORS FACULTY ON WHAT'S GOING ON WITH STUDENTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT YOU HAVE A GOOD SENSE OF. HOW THINGS ARE CHANGING IN THE SYSTEM BUT WE THINK IT'S ONE IMPORTANT WAY TO ENSURE THAT? I'M MORE LOOKING AT WHAT'S GOING ON AND IF THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT HAPPEN THAT ARE. OR ISSUES THAT WE DIDN'T WE DIDN'T WANT TO CARVE OUT THERE COULD BE SOME. THOUGHT TO HOW WE MIGHT WANT TO MAKE CHANGES IN THE SYSTEM TO ADDRESS THEM. MY CONCERN IS A YOU KNOW WE START LOW CONTROL FUNDING. SIX YEARS AGO. OF YOU KNOW WE HAD TO DEVELOP THE EL CAP WE HAD TO. FIGURE OUT THE DASHBOARD. IT CHANGED THE. THE WHOLE CULTURE IN SCHOOLS NOT JUST SOMETHING CONTROLLED BY SUPERINTENDENT BUT THE COMMUNITY AND PARENTS AND KIDS AND. AND REALLY CHANGED. THE INVOLVEMENT A COMMUNITY FOR OUR KATIE TWELVE RIGHT AND I THINK ALL THOSE ARE GOOD. BUT TO WAIT SIX YEARS NOW. ARE AND WE'RE TRYING TO CHANGE THE CULTURE NICK UNICOLOR DISTRICT POLICE TO. A MONETARY SYSTEM I THINK THAT'S GOING TO TAKE LONG TIME SO DO THE. TO THE CHANCELLOR. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO MANAGE THIS CHANGE IN? YOU KNOW I I MADE A COMMENT BACK WE STARTED SIX YEARS AGO OF LOCAL FUNDING AS IT IS COULD TAKE FOUR TO SIX YEARS TO GET THIS THING ALONE. COULD YOU DON'T. WE HAD A LIGHT SWITCH OF PEOPLE THOUSAND CHANGE. IN OTHER GOING TO THINK HOW THEY USED TO DO IT SO. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO MANAGE THE CHANGE WITHIN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES OF WE DO THIS? AND I THINK THAT'S THEY ARE YOU KNOW I I MENTION CAPACITY BUILDING I THINK THAT TAKES A LOT OF FORMS. BUT I WOULD SAY THANK YOU KNOW WE ARE RAMPING UP THOSE EFFORTS. GENERALLY I THINK THE. PART OF CHANCELLOR OAKLEY'S VISION IS THAT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE PLAYS A MORE CENTRAL ROLE IN SUPPORTING STUDENT SUCCESS IN THE SYSTEM ARM. SO I THINK THERE ARE THERE BEEN. YOU NO LONGER EFFORTS. THE AYE IP AYE INSTITUTIONAL EFFECTIVENESS PARTNERSHIP WORK THAT WE'RE DOING I THINK IS ONE WAY WE'VE DONE IT. IN RECENT YEARS I THINK THE GUIDED PATHWAYS WORK OF SUPPORTING COLLEGES AND IMPLEMENTING GUIDED PATHWAYS IS A MODEL BUT I THINK WE CAN. THINK ABOUT MOVING FORWARD THOSE CONVERSATIONS I THINK OUR PRELIMINARY BUT I. I THINK WE ARE COMMITTED AND WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT A PART OF MAKING SURE A SYSTEM LIKE THIS WORKS IS THAT. COLLEGES KNOW HOW TO TAKE THE. YOU KNOW TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE INCENTIVES THAT CREATES SO I THINK THAT INVOLVES WORK FROM OUR OFFICE IN THAT INVOLVES WORK. FROM THE SYSTEM AND THINKING THROUGH. HOW DO WE TAKE SUCCESSFUL PRACTICES IN ONE CONTEXT AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE AVAILABLE TO THE COLLEGES ELSEWHERE? ARE YOU SETTING UP A SEPARATE ORGANIZATION STRUCTURE HOT. HOW YOU DOING THIS YET THE LOTTERY WORDS RIGHT THERE BUT I'M SURE I THINK I'M HARD I GRABBED ON? GUIDED PATHWAYS WOULD BE ONE EXAMPLE THAT I THINK WE HAVE PROVIDED. SO ONE TIME RESOURCES LEGISLATUREAPPROVED ONE TIME RESOURCES LAST YEAR OUR OFFICE HAS BEEN SUPPORTING THAT WE OFTEN AND THROUGHOUT A LOT OF THIS WORK. TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE EXPERTISE OF COLLEGES THE INSTITUTIONAL EFFECTIVENESS WORK IS LARGELY IN MANY CASES PEER DRIVEN BUT IT'S COLLEGES SUPPORTING OTHER COLLEGES AND ADVANCING CHANGE. SO I DON'T. YOU KNOW I I THINK IT WOULD BE PRELIMINARY WE DON'T WE HAVEN'T PROPOSED ANY TYPE OF NEW STRUCTURE BUT I THINK WE. ACKNOWLEDGE THAT CENTRALLY OUR OFFICE NEEDS TO PLAY A ROLE. YOU'RE YOU CARRY BACK HIS CHANCES ARE I. I LIKE TO HEAR THE DISCUSSION I WAS GONNA MANAGE CHANGE THAT IS LISTEN ALLOCATE TO OUR WE HAD A THOUSAND SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACROSS THE STATE. HERE'S ONE GOVERNANCE BODY AND IF INDEED DO SOME LIKE THIS TRAINS. THE CULTURE. HAVE YOU UP WHEN I READ MY STATE AGENCY AND I WAS CHANGING AT. YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF. RESPECT YOU HAVE TO GIVE TO YOUR EMPLOYEES. TO GET THEM TO WHERE YOU WANT TO GO GET. INTO THIS THIS IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT. CHANGE I GUESS OF MY LAST COMING TO BE. AS I WAS LOOKING THIS ABOUT TALKING MY STAFF ON ITS IT ESSENTIALLY. WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IN THE PAST WHAT HAS BEEN WORKING VERY WELL IN THIS IN THIS IS A COMMON THERE? MANY BUREAUCRACIES THAT WE REWARD ACTIVITIES. YOU KNOW WE WERE GIVEN MONEY FOR PEOPLE TO DO STUFF. AND THAT'S A FAILURE. WE'VE LEARNED A LONG TIME AGO THAT IT'S BETTER TO REWARD RESULTS. NOT JUST ACTIVITIES BUT RESULTS AND SO. WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS CHANGE THE CULTURE OF THE COMMUNICABLE JUST THINK THAT? THAT'S A GOOD THING. YOU NO M. BUSINESSES BEEN THERE AS LONG TIME. YOU NOTE. NOT WE WHAT ACTIVITIES BUT. RESULTS SOB I'M EXCITED ABOUT IT I WISH I COULD BE AROUND IS SIX YEARS HE WAS GOING TO HAPPEN TO IT BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO TAKE YOU OUT. SOME TIME TO GET THERE BUT DATA. WE DO KNOW THIS WORD WE HAVE SOME BIG GAPS WERE NOT EETING SO I APPLAUD TO GOVERNOR EVER. TAKEN THIS ON IN. CHANCELLOR'S NEW THEREIN. WE'LL SEE HOW GRAY HIS HAIR GETS OVER THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS TRYING TO DO THIS THING. THANKS. MR MEDINA THANK YOU. FIRST OF ALL LET ME THINK OF THE CHAIR MCCARTY FOR. HAVING THIS ON THE AGENDA. IT WAS FIRST BROUGHT FORWARD IN JANUARY WE'RE NOW IN MARCH. AND THE INTENTION IS TO TRY TO HAVE THIS THROUGH BY JUNE WHEN THE BUDGET GETS APPROVED. I I WANT TO REMIND THE COMMITTEE. THAT I SERVED THIRTEEN YEARS ON A COMMUNITY COLLEGE ABOARD RIVERSIDE COMMUNITY COLLEGE BOARD. AND. AND A TEACHER. ALSO. AGAIN THIRTY FOUR YEARS AND I SAY THAT BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING MORE COMPLICATED. THAT I'VE ENCOUNTERED THEN SCHOOL FUNDING. OF OR COMMUNITY COLLEGE. AYE THERE'S SOME OF WHAT I'VE HEARD HERE THIS AFTERNOON THAT I AGREE WITH. BEING ON THE ON THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE BOARD FOR THIRTEEN YEARS. CERTAINLY. OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES FEEL THE FRUSTRATION. THE FRUSTRATION OF NOT SEEN. COMPLETION THE FRUSTRATION OF SEEN. STUDENTS REMAIN. WITHOUT GETTING A DEGREE OR CERTIFICATE OR TRANSFER. THAT THAT'S AN ISSUE THAT'S AN ISSUE FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE TO TO GRAPPLE WITH. BUT I'M STRUCK AS I SIT HERE OF THIS AFTERNOON THE VERY LITTLE DISCUSSION THAT HAS OCCURRED. TO DATE. AT LEAST WITH THE LEGISLATURE. SO A FINAL LEGISLATOR WHO CHAIRS HIGHER EDUCATION. AND I'M A LEGISLATOR WHO'S SERVED THIRTEEN YEARS ON A COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND I'M HAVING A HARD TIME TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THIS PROPOSAL. IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS WE'RE GONNA ASK THE LEGISLATURE. OF THE HUNDRED TWENTY MEMBERS MOST OF WHOM DID NOT SPEND. A THEIR LIFETIME OR A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF TIME TO VOTE ON SOMETHING THAT IS VERY COMPLICATED. WITHOUT A WHOLE LOT OF INFORMATION. SO I AYE AYE SURE THAT BECAUSE I I JUST DON'T KNOW THAT. SIX MONTHS. PROVIDE JANUARY TO JUNE IS ENOUGH TIME FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO REALLY MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS ON SOMETHING SO IMPORTANT AS THIS. AYE I AM NOT SURE AND I'VE HEARD FROM A. COMMUNITY COLLEGE PRESIDENTS. FROM THE. THAT THE SENATE'S. OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE. THAT THEY DON'T FEEL THAT THEY'VE HAD ENOUGH TIME TO. TO TO DEAL WITH THIS I CERTAINLY DON'T FEEL THAT I HAVE. SO I I I THINK THIS IS TOO IMPORTANT A DECISION. TO MAKE IN SUCH A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. OF YOU KNOW I AM TRYING AS HARD AS I CAN. TO TO UNDERSTAND IT AND I'M HAVING A HARD TIME. YOU KNOW I'M HAVING A HARD TIME TRYING THE WAY YOU KNOW I I I I REALIZE IT'S. A LOFTY GOAL. YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYONE WHO CARES MORE ABOUT STUDENTS THAN. THEN. FOLKS HERE SAID NON THIS DYESS. BUT I AM STRUCK. ALSO BY WHAT I'VE SOMETIMES SEEN IN EDUCATION HOW THE PENDULUM SWINGS. IN EDUCATION. YOU NO THAT THAT THAT WE GO FROM ONE TO ANOTHER. AND I AGAIN WOULD ASK WHERE ARE THE FACTS WORDS WERE IS THE DATA WHERE IS THE DATA BECAUSE WE'VE ALREADY HEARD GOOD QUESTIONS. ABOUT. YOU KNOW HOW HOW DO WE KNOW. YOU KNOW WHAT ARE THE IT WOULD AGAIN BE THE CONSEQUENCES TWENTY FIVE PERCENT. FOR. FOR. RESULTS. YOU KNOW AYE ICE I TAUGHT IN A CONTINUATION HIGH SCHOOL I TAUGHT IN A HIGH SCHOOL WHERE I WILL TELL YOU. YOU NO I I I I DON'T THINK THAT IT IS. OUT OF THOSE ROUND OF POSSIBILITIES THAT SCHOOL SOMETIMES. A DISCOURAGE STUDENTS FROM COMING TO SCHOOL. I'M TED STATES. SOME STUDENTS ARE DISCOURAGED AND AGAIN I'VE HEARD FROM FACULTY. THAT THEY WOULD BE PRESSURE TO. GIVE GRADES. SO AYE I AM I AM I AM JUST VERY MUCH STRUCK BY THE THE TIME FRAME. OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE. AND US AND SAY WOULD AND ASKED THE QUESTION WHAT. IS THE HURRY SO LET ME ASK THAT QUESTION WHAT IS THE VERY WHY ARE WE TRYING TO DO THOSE SO QUICKLY. SO. YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WHAT WE'VE BEEN HEARING AND ENGAGING WITH. IT DISTRICTS IS A CURRENT MODEL IS JUST NOT WORKING AND LOOKING AT. AT THE RAISING COSTS AND LOOKING AT A ROMAN TRANSIT THERE'S A LOT OF VOLATILITY AND THE EXISTING MODEL AND MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR COLLEGES. ADDS TO PLAN SO THIS IS A CONCERN THAT WE'VE WE'VE BEEN HEARING. AT AT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. AND WE THINK THAT. AT THIS MOMENT AYE THIS IT IS IMPORTANT TO ALIGN THE FUNDING STRUCTURES AND THE INCENTIVES. TO FURTHER ENHANCE AND SUPPORT AT THE STUDENT SUCCESS WORK THAT IS HAPPENING A CURRENTLY WITH GUIDED PATHWAYS WIT AB SEVEN OH FIVE AND RE SHIFTING THE INCENTIVES AND THE GOAL IS TO THINK ABOUT NOT JUST ONE FACTOR ENROLLMENT. BUT THINKING ABOUT AS STUDENT SUCCESS AND ALIGNING THE FISCAL INCENTIVES WAYS. THE STUDENT SUCCESS EFFORTS THAT ARE HAPPENING SO WE THINK THAT THIS IS THE NEXT STEP ON FURTHERING AND HAD SEEN THAT WORK I'M WE HEAR YOUR CONCERNS AND WE'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT. BEING THOUGHTFUL ABOUT THE TRANSITION. TO THE NEW FUNDING FORMULA WE'VE INCLUDED A HOLD HARMLESS TO ENSURE THAT DISTRICTS AND HAVE TIME TO PLAN AND TO KNOW HOW MUCH FUNDING THEY WILL BE GETTING AS A TRANSITION TO THE NEW FUNDING FORMULA. AND WE HAVE AN ON GOING. HOLD HARMLESS AS WELL AS PART OF THAT. ABSOLUTELY THINKING ABOUT. AT PROVIDING THE COLLEGES WITH SAM AND STABILITY IN PLANNING AND SO I THINK THOSE ARE ALL THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IN TRAINING CORPORATE INTO INTO OUR PROPOSAL. I WOULD JUST AND AND I. RESPECT YOUR YOUR PLOT POINT ABOUT US NOT DOING ENOUGH TO TO WORK WITH LEGISLATORS IF THERE'S WORK THAT WE SHOULD BE DOING OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS. WE ARE HAPPY TO DO IT I DO ONE IT JUST. YOU KNOW MAYBE SUGGEST THAT I DON'T THINK THIS IS THE THIS HAVE BEEN. CONSIDERED IN OUR SYSTEM IN THE LEGISLATURE OVER THE PAST DECADE BUT I THINK THIS IS A CONVERT CONVERSATION THAT'S HAPPENED BEFORE. YOU KNOW THOSE PROPOSALS HAVEN'T BEEN ENACTED WE THINK IT'S. THIS IS A MODEST STEP FORWARD THAT BEGINS TO. INCORPORATE SOME OF THESE ADDITIONAL VALUES VALUES AROUND. YOU KNOW BEGINNING TO CONSIDER AS PART OF A FONT FUNDING FORMULA STUDENT CHARACTERISTICS THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT A. YOU KNOW TO RECOGNIZE AND THEN. THIS EMPHASIS ON PERFORMANCE AND I WOULD SAY I THINK THE TIMING IN MANY WAYS IS DRIVEN BY OUR BOARDS. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF THE VISION FOR SUCCESS THAT WE NEED TO BEGIN TO DO MORE BUT A PRETTY FAST TIME FRAME THAT THE VISION FOR SUCCESS SAYS THAT WE WILL MEET THE GOALS BY TWENTY TWENTY TWO. AND IF WE'RE GONNA. YET ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS I THINK WE FEEL PRETTY STRONGLY THAT. THE WORK NEEDS TO BEGIN IMMEDIATELY. I I HEARD SAID THAT. THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT THIS PROPOSAL HAS BEEN THAT. BROUGHT UP AND THAT IT'S BEEN BROUGHT UP IN THE LAST DECADE BUT I I I WOULD REMIND THE COMMITTEE THAT. THAT AS A SENIOR MEMBER THERE'S NO ONE WHO'S BEEN IN THIS LEGISLATURE LONGER THAN I. A AND THAT'S FIVE YEARS SIX YEARS RIGHT NOW. AND. AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME WE'RE HEARING ABOUT IT AND TALKING ABOUT IT I MEAN I DON'T MEAN TO SUGGEST THIS SPECIFIC PROPOSAL BUT I THINK THESE TYPES OF CONCEPTS THINKING ABOUT PERFORMANCE IN THE CONTEXT OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE FINANCE. THINKING ABOUT EQUITY IN THIS CONTEXT I THINK THESE ARE. ISSUES THAT CAME UP IN THE STUDENT SUCCESS TASK FORCE ON THESE ARE ISSUES THAT CAME UP IN WORK LED BY OUR PARTNERS. YOU KNOW THE CAMPAIGN FOR COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY PREVIOUSLY AND SO YOU WRITE. THIS PROPOSAL IS CERTAINLY. YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT CAME OUT IN JANUARY BUT I. I DON'T THINK WE'VE. WE'VE BEEN DELIBERATING ON SIMILAR ISSUES. FOR FIRST A NUMBER OF YEARS. I I HAVE NO OTHER. I DON'T THINK I DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER RECOURSE THAN TO TO SAY THAT I I I WOULD THINK THAT THE. WE NEED TO SLOW THE PROCESS DOWN. IF I DON'T FEEL. INCLUDED IN IN THE PROCESS I I HAVE VERY LITTLE DOUBT THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF. FOLKS IN THE. IN THE COMMUNICABLE ITS COMMUNITY THAT FEEL THE SAME WAY. AND I JUST DON'T THINK THE BEST POLICY IS EVER MADE JUST RUSSIAN IT THROUGH. THANK YOU SOMEONE MEMBERS ONLY MEMBER LIMON. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS I THINK FROM COLLEAGUES IT THEY'VE BEEN PARTICULARLY HELPFUL IN IN THINKING THROUGH THE ISSUES. AND MY QUESTION IS AND I THINK IT'S FOR YOU KNOW. THAT THOSE OF YOU TO THINK ABOUT AS I KEEP HEARING IN THE FUNDING FORMULA. I ALSO KEEP REFERENCING TO THE EXPERIENCE I HAD AS A SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER WITHOUT LC FF AND THEN WITH KELSEY FF. AND THE REASON I BRING THAT UP IS BECAUSE THAT THERE IS A LOT. THE FEELINGS THAT ARE VERY SIMILAR AROUND MOVING TO A LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. BUT I ASK MYSELF WHAT DO SUCCESS LOOK LIKE UNDER THIS FUNDING FORMULA IN THE EYES OF STUDENTS. BUT I THINK FUND IT AYE I THINK FUNDAMENTALLY IT IS. IMPROVED DEGREE AND CERTIFICATE ATTAINMENT IMPROVE TRANSFER OR. IMPROVE COMPLETION OF CAREER ORIENTED PROGRAMS. PARTICULARLY AMONG STUDENTS TO. WE SEE GAPS IN PERFORMANCE THAT TODAY. SO THOSE ARE A. I ACTUALLY THINK THAT DOES SOUND LIKE GOALS THAT YOU MAY ALL HAVE BEEN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT LIKE WHAT IS GONNA CHANGE IN THE LIFE OF A STUDENT. ON EVERY DAY BASES A COMMUNITY COLLEGE. CAMPUS BY GOING TO THIS FOR THIS FORMULA LIKE WHAT IT IS WAS THEIR EXPERIENCE GOING TO BE DIFFERENT. ARE THEY GONNA HAVE MORE ACCESS TO PROGRAMS LESS ACCESS. AND OR LIMITED ACCESS BUT NOW MORE FOCUSED AS OPPOSED TO MUCH GENERAL ADVISING WHAT DOES THIS REALLY LOOK LIKE. FROM A STUDENT PERSPECTIVE. AND I WOULD JUST ECHO SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT THE LA ALL MADE THAT. THERE IS THROUGH RESEARCH THAT CORRELATES AT AN INCENTIVE SOME FUNDING FORMULAS WITH BEHAVIORAL CHANGES AT THE INSTITUTION. THINGS LIKE REVAMPING STUDENT ADVISING STREAMLINING FINANCIALLY PROCESS THESE INCREASING DATA TO INFORM DECISIONS SO THERE IS RESEARCH OUT THERE THAT'S SHOWS I'M VERY REAL PRACTICES AND BEHAVIORS THAT CHANGE WHEN THE FINANCIAL INCENTIVES CHANGE. RIGHT AND AND AGAIN THAT IS I THINK A RESPONSE AND. IT THAT THAT SOUNDS TO ME FROM THE EYES OF AN ADMINISTRATOR RATE SO WHEN I THINK OF THIS IS SO INCREASE ACCESS TO FINANCIAL AID SO THERE'S GONNA BE LESS FINANCIAL AID LINES ARE NOT HAVE TO WAIT IN LINE LONGER THE PROCESS IS GOING TO GO FASTER THEY'RE GONNA. GET AN EMERGENCY LOAN LIKE WHAT DOES THIS LOOK LIKE FOR STUDENTS THEY'RE GONNA GET TO SEE AN ADVISER A COUNSELOR SOONER. AND THEIR CLASSES ARE GOING TO BE FULL AND THEY'RE NOT GONNA HAVE TO WAIT ANOTHER SEMESTER TO GET YOU KNOW THE A GET THE CLASSES WHAT IS IT LOOKS LIKE FOR STUDENTS. YEAH THAT I THINK THERE ARE SPECIFIC PRACTICES THAT WE'VE WE'VE HEARD FROM LOCAL COLLEGES LAKE I'M NOT STREAMLINING FINANCIAL INVESTING IN SOFTWARE TO STREAMLINE FINANCIAL APOSTASY SO HE COULD AND HE GET OUT THERE. AND WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR A STUDENT TO STREAMLINE THE PROCESS SEES WHAT IS THAT MEAN FOR THE STUDENTS STUDENT AS I HAVE TO WAIT IN LINE THEY'RE ABLE TO GET THEIR FINANCIAL AID MUCH QUICKER SO THEY'RE ABLE TO PLAN. AND. PLAN FOR THE PROGRAMS. BUT BY EMPRESS FOR SOME OF FINANCE I WOULD ALSO ADD THE WHAT IT MEANS FOR STUDENT IS NOW THAT THAT STAFF IS NO LONGER FOCUSED ON THE MANUAL PROCESSING OF APPLICATIONS. GRADUALLY AVAILABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS THAT THE STUDENT WOULD HAVE. TO HELP THEM FILL OUT THE THE FORMS IF THEY'RE GETTING STUCK ON A PARTICULAR YOU KNOW BOX IN THE IMPACT OF WHAT THAT MEANS. SO REALLY FROM A STUDENT THEY HAVE MORE ACCESS TO THE TYPES OF HELP THAT THEY WOULD NEED TO COMPLETE THEIR APPLICATIONS. TO RECEIVE FINANCIAL AID I THINK YOU WILL SEE COLLEGES LOOK POURED SOME OF THOSE ASPECTS I'M IF WE LOOK PORT AB SEVEN OH FIVE. YOU KNOW IT IT'S THOSE TYPE OF ASPECTS WERE FROM A STUDENT NOW YOUR HIGH SCHOOL GPA AND TRANSCRIPT DATA MAY BE USED. TO HELP PLACE TO IN COURSES SO THAT YOU CAN BETTER OUT COMPLETE. COLLEGE LEVEL MATH AND ENGLISH COURSES IN A MORE TIMELY MANNER WHICH ACTUALLY LEADS TO A MORE TIMELY COMPLETION OF YOUR DEGREE SO THOSE ARE REAL WORLD THINGS THAT A STUDENT WOULD SEE. WELL I GUESS YOU KNOW. SPEAKING OF TIME TO DEGREE I MEAN THAT MEANS A LOT FOR THOSE OF US THAT WORKED ON TIME TO AGREE I JUST. YET YOU KNOW IT'S A GOOD GOAL AND I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW IT HELPS THE EVERYDAY STUDENT BECAUSE THEY THINK THAT THAT IS. FOR ME ONE OF THE PIECES THAT'S BEEN MISSING I HEAR A LOT OF THE ULTIMATE GOALS IT HAS BUT I ALSO THINK. THAT A LOT OF THE FUNDING FORMULAS DATE THE PENDULUM DOES SWING IT DOES GO FROM ONE STATE TO ANOTHER WE BELIEVING CATEGORICAL AS WERE VERY FOCUSED. AND THEN WE KIND OF MOVE BACK AND WE DO MORE OF A BLOCK GRANT OR SOME LC FF MODEL. AND I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT AS WE MOVE IN ANY DIRECTION OUT WE DON'T LOSE SIGHT THAT IF THE STUDENTS NOT SEEN. THIS THAT POSITIVE IMPACT I THINK IT IT IT BECOMES A REAL CHALLENGE I. AND. YOU KNOW IT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THERE IS DEFINITELY AA THINK. TO PROPOSALS THAT HAVE JET AND GENERATED A LOT OF CONVERSATION HOME AROUND THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES THIS BEING ONE OF THEM. AND THE PROPOSAL AND IN THE THE COMMENTS AT LEAST FROM THE DISTRICT THAT I REPRESENT GENERATE MORE QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS AND I WONDER WHAT THAT. YOU KNOW AND AND NOT NECESSARILY STRICT OPPOSITION AS IS MORE OF LIKE HERE'S. BUDGET QUESTIONS TO ASK HOW DO WE KNOW IT'S GONNA WORK. AT THE HOLD HARMLESS AND IN THE HOLD HARMLESS CAME FROM THE K. TO TWELVE HEALTHY FF WORLD LIKE WE ALL KNOW WHERE THAT CAME FROM EIGHTEEN FROM A SPACE WHERE THERE WERE SCHOOL DISTRICTS OVER AND OVER COMING TO LEGISLATORS AND SAY. WE ARE YOU KNOW NOT BENEFITING FROM THIS. AND WHERE THE LOSERS THE WINNERS AND LOSERS DISCOURSE CAME FROM THAT AND. AND THOSE CONCERNS BY I THINK WE HAVE WAYS TO GO TO TRY TO ADDRESS CONCERNS TO BRING FOLKS ON BOARD I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE STEPS ARE I FEEL LIKE I ACTUALLY THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES I THINK HAVE BEEN DOING. AN EXCELLENT JOB AND HOLDING REGIONAL MEETINGS WAY IF EDUCATORS AND STAKEHOLDERS BUT IT SEEMS THAT THOSE HAVE BEEN HELPFUL BUT THEY HAVEN'T MET. AND THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF REALLY BRINGING EVERYBODY EDUCATORS INCLUDED ONBOARD. TO SAY HEY I THINK WE CAN MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS. AND IN THE END FOR ME IF I AM. IF THE STUDENT IS GOING TO SEE KIND OF EVERY DAY EXPERIENCE OR. THAT THE STATUS QUO IN SOME WAY. I WORRY THAT WE HAVEN'T PUT THAT STEPS IN THE STRUCTURE THE PATHWAY THERE TO GET TO THESE REALLY GOOD GOALS THAT I CAN AGREE WITH ALL THOSE GOAL YOU'VE MENTIONED NOT ONE GOAL THAT I DISAGREE WITH. THAT I THINK WOULD BE BAD FOR STUDENTS. BUT I THINK THAT IF THE PATHWAYS NOT CREATED. TO GET BOTH EDUCATORS AND STUDENTS THERE. IT'S REALLY HARD TO GET TO THE SCHOOLS. SO AND YOU KNOW I A HERE THE PROPOSAL'S I HEAR THE COMMENTS GENERATED BY COLLEAGUES AND I FIND THEM HELPFUL AND. YOU KNOW. I'M STILL KIND OF THINKING OF WHAT SPACE WHAT'S MISSING TO GET US THERE A IS IT TIME THAT'S MISSING IS IT MORE STAKEHOLDER INVOLVEMENT AND. I YOU KNOW I I MET LITTLE BIT AT A LOSS I DON'T KNOW THAT I HAVE A SOLUTION TO OFFER. AS MUCH AS I'M JUST TRYING TO PROVIDE A PERSPECTIVE OF HAVING HAD THIS CONVERSATION FOR SEVERAL MONTHS NOW UNDER STILL LITTLE BIT OF A GAP THAT'S THERE. DON'T THINK YOU FOR YOUR. ANSWERS. THANK YOU MISTER MARTZ RICHIE. YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. SO. THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE YOU STARTED OFF YOUR PRESENTATION BY TALKING ABOUT HOW. THE CURRENT SYSTEM PRIORITIZES ENROLLMENT NOT STUDENT SUCCESS. AND SO. FROM THAT. PERSPECTIVE IF YOU'RE IF THE PROPOSED. CHANGE IN THE FUNDING FORMULA IS TO. PRIORITIZE STUDENT SUCCESS I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU A LETTER THAT I RECEIVED FROM. WHAT I BELIEVE IS A SUCCESSFUL COMMUNICABLE H. IN MY DISTRICT EL CAMINO COLLEGE? I AM LOOKING AT A LETTER FROM THE PRESIDENT OF EL CAMINO. COMMITTEE COLLEGE HERE. AND AND SHE'S SHE'S SITES HOW. WHILE THE NEW FORMULA IS OSTENSIBLY DESIGNED TO IMPROVE DECLINE DEGREE COMPLETION AND OTHER OUTCOMES. IT ACTUALLY THREATENS TO CUT FUNDING FOR WELL PERFORMING COLLEGES LIKE EL CAMINO COLLEGE. WHERE OVER SEVENTY PERCENT OF OUR COLLEGE PREPARES STUDENTS COMPLETE A DEGREE OR CERTIFICATE? OR ARE READY TO TRANSFER TO A FOUR YEAR UNIVERSITY. WHEN THEY FINISH THEIR STUDIES HERE. EL CAMINO RANKS THIRD IN THE STATE FOR TRANSFERS TO CSU. AND ARE CONSISTENTLY IN THE TOP TEN IN THE STATE FOR TRANSFERS TO THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA SYSTEM. SO. YEAH I EL COMINO IS ONE OF THE SCHOOLS THAT. ACCORDING TO THE LATEST PROJECTIONS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE CUT. BY THIS NEW FUNDING FORMULA. WITHOUT THE HOLD HARMLESS PROVISION AND BUT I AM STILL ARE CONFUSED AS TO HOW THE HOLD HARMLESS PROVISION WORKS BECAUSE. WHAT SHE TOLD ME? IS THAT THE HOLD HARMLESS WHO BATES BASICALLY ONLY PROTECT THEM FOR ONE YEAR. AND AND SO AND THE MOST POWERFUL STATEMENT AND IN THIS LETTER. THAT I FIND HERE IS THAT IF THE FUNDING FORMULA GOES FORWARD AS ORIGINALLY DEFINED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WITHOUT THE BENEFIT OF THE EXPERIENCE. PERSPECTIVE AND ANALYSIS OF THE C. E. O.'S AND CB OWES OF OUR COMMUNICATIVE IS. THIS MAY PROVE TO BE THE WORST EXPERIMENT AND PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION CALIFORNIA HAS EVER SEEN. SO. THIS LETTER HERE. COMING FROM. YOU KNOW SOMEONE WHO IS IN CHARGE OF RUNNING ONE OF OUR MOST SUCCESSFUL COMMITTEE COLLEGES. YOU KNOW. RACES. SERIOUS DOUBT IN MY MIND AS TO. HOW MUCH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAS CONSULTED WITH OUR COMMUNICATIVE LEADERS WHO HAVE BEEN PRODUCING THE SUCCESSFUL RESULTS? I SEE ME LIKE A RESPONSE TO THAT. IF YOU LIKE MAYBE THERE ARE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. YEAH I'VE I THINK ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WE'VE FACED. IN THIS PROCESS IS THERE IS A FISCAL YEAR STARTING. AND THERE'S STILL A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY AND I THINK THE UNCERTAINTY. IS MAKING OF FOLKS YOU KNOW. ANXIOUS IS PROBABLY A VERY. MILDLY TO PUT IT I THINK HOPEFULLY WE CAN DESIGN IN OUR INTENT WHAT WE'VE HEARD FROM THE CEOS THAT WE'VE CONSULTED WITH PICK AND. CHANCELLOR OAKLEY ASKED A GROUP OF CIOS TO THINK THROUGH THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. HEAT WE'VE RELIED ON THE ADVICE ADVISORY WORK GROUP ON FISCAL AFFAIRS WHICH IS A GROUP OF CBO SO WE HAVE CONSULTED WITH THEM I THINK THERE IS A STRONG RECOMMENDATION FROM BOTH OF THOSE GROUPS THAT. WE NEED A HOLD HARMLESS THAT IS. YOU KNOW TO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL A DISTRICT WOULD GET NO LESS THAN A GETS IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN AND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. AND THEN BEGINNING IN NINETEEN TWENTY OF A DISTRICT WOULD GET NO LESS ON A PER STUDENT BASIS I THINK WHAT THE LETTER SUGGESTS IS THAT. DISTRICTS ARE SEEKING A OF A LONGER PERIOD WHERE THEY ARE HELD AT NO LESS THAN THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN LEVELS AND I THINK FOR MANY DISTRICTS. THEY WOULD LIKE NO LESS THAN THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN LEVELS ADJUSTED FOR THE COST OF LIVING. HE KNOWS THE. YEAH. WE HEAR THAT AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ARE TAKING IT INTO VERY STRONG CONSIDERATION AS WE THINK ABOUT RECOMMENDATIONS A TO MAKE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. I THINK THE CHALLENGES ONE THAT WAS. PRODUCT BY THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE THAT BE. UP THE LONGER YOU. HOLD DISTRICTS HARMLESS AND THE MORE MONEY WE SPEND FOR THOSE PROVISIONS. THAT'S LESS MONEY THAT WE ARE ABLE TO USE TO CREATE THE TYPES OF INCENTIVES WE WANT TO CREATE SO I THINK THAT'S THE BALANCE WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO STRIKE NAM. BUT I I HOPE AND I I THINK THE YOU KNOW. THE MESSAGE WE WOULD GIVE IS THAT WE HAVE HEARD A LOT OF THESE CONCERNS LOUD AND CLEAR WE ARE. TRYING TO BE RESPONSIVE TO THAT RECOGNIZING THAT WE HAVE A GOAL OF TRYING TO. BUY IMPLEMENT A FORMULA THAT. ACHIEVES THE KINDS OF ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FOR. FOR UNDERSERVED STUDENTS AND THAT AND ENCOURAGES THE TYPES OF INCIDENTS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT. WELL. AND I WOULD JUST ADD THAT THAT WE'VE BEEN ENGAGED IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THE CBO IS IN THE SEALS AND. VARIOUS DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS AND WE ARE TAKING THEIR FEEDBACK. CONSIDERATION. ALRIGHT WELL I I I DON'T KNOW IF A. THEM PRESIDENT OF EL CAMINO COLLEGE WAS NOT PART OF. THESE GROUPS AND THAT. OF THESE CEOS EVEN. CONSULTING WITH BETTER. YEAH I. I FIND MYSELF AGREEING WITH THE ARE ARE CHAIR OF OUR. HIGHER EDUCATION COMMITTEE THAT. YOU KNOW WHAT IS THE RUSH HERE. I MEAN IF THERE ARE. IF THE CEO OF ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL COMMITTEE COLLEGES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS SAYING. YOU KNOW THAT THEY ARE NOT BEING ADEQUATELY CONSULTED. I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT AND. AS LONG AS I'M HEARING. THINGS LIKE THIS I CANNOT SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S. FUNDING FORMULA. THANK YOU BUT. I THINK WHAT SEN. WHAT WE'D LIKE TO FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF ICQ COLLEGES IS TO? IS TO MOVE. HERE AS WE TALK ABOUT THE TWO HEARINGS NOW. HERE FROM THAT THE PUBLIC NOT TO SET THIS. I HEARING BUT ACROSS CALIFORNIA POTENTIALLY TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION DURING THE MARY VISION AND AND WILL LOOK AT THAT AND WE MAY COME UP WITH THEIR OWN. CULTURE TO PLAN HER NEXT THE PLAN ALTOGETHER WHAT HAVE YOU SO WEAK WE RESERVE THAT RIGHT CERTAINLY. BUT I THINK TO IT I JUST WANT TO. REITERATE THAT. THAT THE GOAL OF THE LCF THAT. WHEN WE STARTED THIS THING QUE TWELVE WAS A WORTHY ONE AND THAT'S WHY I THINK WE. WE'VE WE LIKED HOW IT'S BEEN ROLLED OUT THE K. TWELVE LEVEL TO SOME EXTENT WAS STILL A LONG WAYS TO GO AS FAR AS JUST. FRANKLY RESOURCES. AND THAT'S WHY WE STARTED THIS DISCUSSION. LAST YEAR BUT. WHICH ONE TO MAKE SURE HOW THIS IS IMPLEMENTED THAT WERE SERVING THE STUDENTS WHO THE COMMUNICATIVE TARGET OTHER. THEY TIMES. LOW INCOME FIRST IN THEIR FAMILY TO GO TO COLLEGE AND WE WE WOULDN'T WANT. IT TO TO TO GO AWAY FROM WHAT THAT WE'VE BEEN ALL ABOUT FOR THE LAST. HUNDRED YEARS OR SO IN CALIFORNIA SERVING NEARLY TWO MILLION COMMITTEE CALLED STATE ITSELF. SO WITH THAT. FOR QUESTIONS COMMENTS WILL. OPEN IT UP TO. PUBLIC COMMENTS NOW STAY WITH HER. I ASK I ASK THE PUBLIC TO PLEASE KEEP YOUR. COMMENTS TO ONE MINUTE OR LESS THANK YOU. ONE MINUTE JIM MILLER PRESIDENT OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE COUNCIL THE CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS. I'M SOME VERY QUICK POINTS IN LESS THAN ONE MINUTE NUMBER ONE IF WE'RE GONNA PUT A MODEL IN PLACE THAT REWARDS STUDENT OUTCOMES IT WE'RE GONNA BECOME NOTHING MORE THAN DIPLOMA MILLS. IF AYE AS PRESIDENT OF OUR UNION EVERYONE WHO GIVES MORES GETS A TEN PERCENT INCREASE PEOPLE GIVEN MORES. RIGHTS OF THIS IS THAT THEY HAVE ANYTHING THAT STUDENT. PERFORMANCE BASED IS GONNA BE A DISINCENTIVE FOR US TO REALLY HAVE QUALITY PROGRAMS. THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES SECONDLY TO ECHO AND MR MEDINA MISTER MARSTERS HIS COMMENTS. THERE HASN'T BEEN ENOUGH TIME TO STUDY THIS IS THIS IS BEN RUSHD IF ANYONE WERE TO SAVE IT TO ANY REASONABLE PERSON WE'RE GONNA OVERHAUL THE COME. WE'RE GOING TO COMPLETELY OVERHAUL THE FUNDING FORMULA FOR THE LARGEST INSTITUTION OF HIGHER EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES WITH VERY LITTLE SHOULD STAKEHOLDER INPUT. AND WE'RE GONNA DO IT IN A FEW MONTHS TIME PEOPLE THINK YOU WOULD BE CRAZY TO DO THAT SO WE NEED FAR MORE TIME TO STUDY THIS IN DETAIL BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY. UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THAT HAVE NOT BEEN CONSIDERED YET WITH THIS AND LASTLY IT WAS MENTIONED ABOUT THE HOLD HARMLESS WHICH IS BASICALLY GIVE DISTRICT THEIR BUDGETS. THAT THEY HAVE THIS YEAR AND KEEP THEM AT THAT LEVEL. THAT'S VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT WE DO WITH THE BASIC EIGHT DISTRICTS NOW THOUGH THE DISTRICTS THAT DON'T RELY ON STATE APPORTIONMENT THE FUNCTION WHY NOT ADOPT THAT FUNDING MODEL FOR ALL COMMUNITY COLLEGES WHY NOT JUST SAY TO EVERYBODY. HERE'S YOUR BUDGET YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH IT DO THE BEST THING YOU CAN TO SERVE STUDENTS WHICH IS WHAT WE DO WITH TEN PERCENT OF THE DISTRICTS WHY CAN'T THAT BE GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE OTHER NINETY PERCENT OF THE DISTRICTS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MUCH DIMMER COMING FROM A PRESENT LUSTROUS COLLEGE FEDERATION TEACHERS ALSO A VICE PRESIDENT OF CALIFORNIA FEDERATION DISHES. VICE PRESIDENT OF THE FACT THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA CAN BE COLLEGES. I JUST WANNA SAY IT JUST A COUPLE THINGS THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU THE VALUE. DEGREES AND CERTIFICATES OVER THE LEARNING DEVELOPMENT MATURITY OF YOUR STUDENTS AND THAT THEY'RE BETTER PREPARED IT LIKE IT'S THAT PART THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THEY DON'T TALK ABOUT IT. THAT'S WHAT WE S. FACTLY CARE ABOUT. YEAH SO THAT'S MORE IMPORTANT TO ME THE OTHER PART OF IT IS THAT YOU KNOW OF THE CEO GROUP HAS JUST. CONCLUDED THEIR WORK JUST ABOUT A WEEK OR TWO AGO ON THIS FUNDING FORMULA COURTS WITHIN MIT THIS IS A BROAD OUTLINE THEY HAVE NOT RUN ONE SIMULATION AND HOW THIS WOULD AFFECT. THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES SO. IF YOUR GONNA GO AHEAD AND APPROVE SOMETHING LIKE THIS IN WHICH NO SIMULATIONS HAVE BEEN DONE THAT THIS IS GOD THIS IS JUST CRAZY. OKAY. ABSOLUTELY THE OTHER THING I DO WANT TO SAY NO ONE MAKE SURE EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS THIS IS THAT WITHIN THE CURRENT FUNDING FORMULA WHICH WE HAVE A GROWTH MULLIN WHICH OCCURRED. SINCE I SPS THREE SIXTEEN AND TWO THOUSAND SIX. OKAY WE DO IT WITH THERE IS A CONCERN THAT MORE MONEY NEEDS TO GO TO THE TO THOSE DISTRICTS THAT ARE SERVING ON A. A VERY NEEDY STUDENTS SO IN THE AYE FORMULA WE ALREADY HAVE OF OF A A FACTOR THAT INVOLVES UNEMPLOYMENT. I'M POVERTY. AND THERE'S ANOTHER ONE THAT ALSO IN YOUR DISTRICT THE NUMBER OF DEGREE. GRADUATE DEGREES THERE IN YOUR DISTRICT SO IF YOU'RE IN A DISTRICT THAT HOUSED LA LOT OF NON DEGREE EARNERS YOU'RE GOING TO GET MORE MONEY. THE OTHER ONE IS GOING TO BE. ALSO HOW MANY PELL GRANTS THAT ARE BEING SERVED IN THE DISTRICT SO THESE ARE ALREADY FACTORS ARE ALREADY IN THE BUDGET FORMULA RIGHT NOW. AND SO IS NOT AS IF WE DON'T CARE ABOUT THOSE THOSE ISSUES AND THINGS IT'S BEEN IN PLACE FOR OVER TEN YEARS ALREADY. SO ALL IF IF WE NEED TO ADJUST THAT MAKES SOME SENSE SMALL ADJUSTMENTS I'M FINE WITH THAT. BUT. NO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS THESE FACTORS ARE ALREADY INCLUDED IN THE CURRENT BUDGET POINT. THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING I'M JOHN STANCE BECAUSE I'M THE PRESIDENT ELECT OF THE ACADEMIC SENATE FOR CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES I REPRESENT. ALL FIFTY THOUSAND FACULTY IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM. AND AYE ACADEMIC MATTERS. I I'M HERE TODAY TO TELL YOU WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT A DISCUSSION OF THE FUNDING FORMULA IS WORTHY OF CONSIDERATION. WE HAVE ASKED TO PARTICIPATE IN SOME OF THESE REAP WORK GROUPS THAT ARE MEETING TO DO THAT AND WE WERE ON. WE WERE DENIED ACCESS TO THOSE WORK GROUPS AND SO BEING ABLE TO. I HAVE ACCESS TO SOME OF THOSE DISCUSSIONS AND DIALOGUE MAY SHAPE. I'M OUTCOME OF WHAT YOU WOULD SEE HERE. WE ARE INTERESTED IN HAVING A CONVERSATION ABOUT FUNDING BUT WE ARE OPPOSED TO ANY FUNDING FORMULA THAT HAS. PERFORMANCE BASED FUNDING FOR SEVERAL REASONS ONE OF THEM IS THAT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT IT MOVES THE NEEDLE ON OVERALL OUTCOMES WHICH SOUNDS LIKE THAT IS THE GOAL. ON THAT'S EVERYONE'S GOAL. THE SECOND PROBLEM WITH THE PERFORMANCE SPACE PIECE IS THAT I HAVE. I THINK IT'S AN INHERENTLY FLAWED IDEA TO THINK. THAT IF WE CHANGE HOW WE FIND THE COLLEGE ON OUTCOMES THAT IT WILL CHANGE THE THE. ACTUAL PERFORMANCE OF THE COLLEGES. BECAUSE FACULTY ARE DEDICATED TO THE OUTCOMES OF THEIR STUDENTS. WE. ARE COMMITTED TO THE SOCIAL JUSTICE MISSION OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AS AGENTS FOR ECONOMIC MOBILITY IN THE STATE. SOME OF THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THAT WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT BY FUNDING OUTCOMES INCLUDE. THE. DISENFRANCHISEMENT FURTHER DISENFRANCHISEMENT OF POPULATIONS WE ARE EXPLICITLY TRYING TO REACH. IN TERMS OF FIRST GENERATION COLLEGE STUDENTS AND. ESPECIALLY OUR STUDENTS OF COLOR AND RETURNING STUDENTS. I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE TODAY A ASSEMBLY MEMBER LIMON YOU ASKED SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THIS WOULD IMPACT STUDENTS. HERE'S SOME WAYS THAT WOULD IMPACT STUDENTS. WE CAN ONLY FIND A CERTAIN NUMBER OF CLASSES IN THE SCHEDULE. AND I KNOW THAT MY. STUDENTS WHO ARE RETURNING STUDENTS TO HAVE STUDENTS IN PUBLIC EDUCATION AND NEED TO LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF TIME THEY SPEND ON CAMPUS. WOULD BENEFIT FROM THE SCHEDULING A CLASS ON FRIDAYS. FROM TEN TO THREE. SO THAT THEY CAN GET THEIR STUDENTS TO SCHOOL THEY CAN COME TO THE CLASS AND THEN THEY CAN LEAVE. I ALSO KNOW THAT THE SUCCESS RATE IN THAT CLASS IS LOWER. THAN STUDENTS WERE ABLE TO COME. MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY AT TEN O'CLOCK. THANK YOU WHO ARE USUALLY YOUNGER. WHICH ONE OF MY GOING TO SCHEDULE. TO FIND WHEN THAT FUNDING FORMULA IS PRESSURING ME TO CONSIDER IT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU. MY NAME IS ANNA HOT AND I TEACH ENGLISH AT AMERICAN RIVER COLLEGE I AM ALSO A MEMBER OF THE LOS. RIOS CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS WELL I WELCOME ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. I HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS WHAT COMPONENT NUMBER THREE. THIS COMPONENT KNOWN AS A STUDENT SUCCESS INCENTIVE GRANT SIMPLY CREATES A CHILLING EFFECTS. AND POSES A THREAT TO MY PROFESSION. GIVING ALL DISTRICTS IN INCENTIVE TO ABORT DEGREES AND CERTIFICATES WILL MAKE THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM INTO DIPLOMA MILL. THEREFORE OUR SEE IF T. OPPOSES THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FOR ANY TYPE OF PERFORMANCE SPACE FUNDING METHODOLOGY. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT MANNER. THANK YOU. HONORABLE REPRESENTATIVES. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK REGARDING THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED FUNDING MODEL FOR THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. I AM PRESIDENT OF SHOULD BOW COLLEGE ON SUSAN SPERLING. WHICH SERVES FIFTEEN THOUSAND STUDENTS AND ONE OF THE MOST. DIVERSE COMMUNITIES IN THE NATION. I IT'S ON THE BASIS OF LONG FAMILIARITY WITH OUR STUDENTS I'VE BEEN AT THE COLLEGE FOR THIRTY YEARS ALTHOUGH NOT ALL THIRTY OF THOSE YEARS AS COLLEGE PRESIDENT MOST OF THEM AS A TEACHER. IN OUR CLASSROOMS. I FEEL THAT I AM. PRETTY DEEPLY FAMILIAR WITH THE NEEDS AND SUCCESSES OF OUR STUDENTS. AND I SHARE. BOB THE DEEP CONCERN ABOUT SOME OF THE UNINTENDED IMPACTS OF THE PROPOSED NEW FUNDING MODEL. THAT COLLEAGUES FROM THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES HAVE SPOKEN TO YOU ABOUT AND THAT SOME OF OF THE HONORABLE REPRESENTATIVES HERE HAVE HAVE SPOKEN TO. SHOULD BOW WE FULLY EMBRACE THE VISION FOR SUCCESS. AW AND SHOULD BOW IS ACTUALLY RECOGNIZE LEADER. IN GUIDED PATHWAYS AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT ARM FOR INSTANCE WE ARE THE CRADLE AND BIRTHPLACE OF. SOME FAMOUS GUIDED PATHWAYS THE POINT THEY PROGRAM. DIRAJA MOSHE PROGRAM STRIVING BLACK BROTHERS THESE ARE PROGRAMS THAT ARE NOW NOT JUST STATEWIDE BUT NATIONWIDE. LIKE MANY LEADERS ACROSS THE SYSTEM I ALSO KNOW THAT WE NEED CHANGE OUR IN THE FUNDING FORMULA NOT NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT. THE FUNDING MODEL YOU'RE CURRENTLY CONSIDERING. RUSHES TOWARDS A WORTHY GOAL WITHOUT FULL ASSESSMENT. OF POTENTIALLY GRAVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THAT THREATEN TO DAMAGE OUR COLLECTIVE GOALS. WE ALL AGREE ON THE GOALS. FOR EXAMPLE. A PROPOSED MAC METRIC FOR THE NEW FUNDING MODEL IS GRADUATION WITHIN. TWO OR THREE YEARS THREE YEARS. MANY SHABBOS STUDENTS COM IN FACT THE VAST MAJORITY OF SHABBOS STUDENTS COME FROM FIRST GENERATION. IMMIGRANT FAMILIES FOR WHOM ENGLISH IS THEIR SECOND LANGUAGE. THEY NEED BASIC SKILLS CLASSES THAT ENABLE THEM TO SUCCEED IN COLLEGE. IN ADDITION TO THEIR ROLES AS STUDENTS THEY SERVICE TRANSLATORS FOR FAMILY MEMBERS WORKERS WHO SUPPORT. A FAMILY INCOME IS VITAL AND PINCH HITTERS FOR FAMILY TRANSPORT AND CHILD AND ELDER CARE. EVEN WITH FINANCIAL INCENTIVES TO ATTEND FULL TIME THESE STUDENTS MAY ONLY BE ABLE TO TAKE. TWO CLASSES A SEMESTER THAT IS THE SOCIAL SOCIO ECONOMIC REALITY. OF SIXTY SEVENTY BEYOND PERCENT OF OUR STUDENTS LIVES SNAPPED AS HE WRAPPED UP PRESIDENT IF TRIPLE TIME OKAY. SO. WE STAND TO LOSE IN MY DISTRICT. CONSIDERABLE FUNDING DESPITE THE FACT THAT WE HAVE VERY VERY. STRONG METRICS FOR STUDENT SUCCESS AND I'M CONCERNED SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE DISENFRANCHISEMENT OF THE STUDENT I JUST MENTIONED THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU PRESIDENT. GOOD EVENING I'M JIM REMAIN WITH THE ACADEMIC SENATE AND I AM TREASURER ELECT. SO I'M GONNA TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT GUIDED PATHWAYS SO FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SPENDING YOUR LATE AFTERNOON EARLY EVENING AND WITH YOUR THOUGHTFUL COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS. THE GUIDED PATHWAYS PLANS HAVE JUST BEEN SUBMITTED BY THE COLLEGES BY THE HUNDRED FOURTEEN COMMUNITY COLLEGES THEY WERE DUE ON MARCH THIRTIETH. A GUIDED PATHWAYS ARE IN THE VERY BEGINNING OF STAGES AND MAY TAKE A MINIMUM OF FIVE YEARS IN AS MANY AS TEN YEARS TO BE FULLY IMPLEMENTED AT OUR HUNDRED FOURTEEN COLLEGES. SO I DON'T SEE HOW OUTCOMES BASED FUNDING IS SUPPORTED BY GUIDED PATHWAYS AT THIS TIME. WE HAVE NO DATA SUPPORTING THIS. FURTHERMORE WE HAVE EVIDENCE THAT OUTCOMES BASED FUNDING DOES NOT INCREASED DEGREE AND CERTIFICATE ATTAINMENT. YES THE CURRENT MODEL ISN'T WORKING BUT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT THIS WILL EITHER. BUT MORE FULL TIME TEACHERS DOES WORK THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS YOU TODAY HAVE UP MY NAME IS DIANE BRADY ON THE VICE PRESIDENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES AT LOS PROCEEDS COLLEGE IN EAST BAY. UP I ALSO WANT TO EXPRESS MY CONCERN ABOUT THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF THE FUNDING FORMULA AS IT'S CURRENTLY PROPOSED. SOME SIMULATIONS REVEAL THAT MORE THAN HALF OF ALL THE COLLEGES STATEWIDE WOULD EXPERIENCE A CUT IN THEIR FUNDING. IN MANY CASES THE CUP WOULD BE MORE SEVERE THAN WHAT THE COLLEGES EXPERIENCE DURING THE GREAT RECESSION A FEW YEARS AGO. IN ADDITION I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE THE POINT THAT THE. THE ASSERTION THAT THE COLLEGE BUDGETS WOULD BE HELD HARMLESS. IS MISLEADING IN THAT EVEN CALL IT WOULD NOT BE GIVEN TO THOSE COLLEGES WE WOULD BE HELD HARMLESS AT THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN RATE WHILE COSTS ARE RISING FOR. UTILITIES AND RETIREMENT AND OTHER THINGS WE WOULD RECEIVE CALL A AND THAT WAS ESSENTIALLY A PAY CUT. OF AND EVEN WORSE THE FORMULA FAILS TO HELP THE STUDENTS WHO NEED US THE MOST IN THE SENSE THAT THOSE WHO ARE ATTENDING PART TIME. WE HAVE MORE THAN SIXTY PERCENT OF OUR STUDENTS ARE ATTENDING PART TIME. OR THEY ON SUCCESSFUL IF THEY DON'T REACH THEIR GOALS IN TWO OR THREE YEARS BECAUSE IT TAKES THEM LONGER MORE THAN SIXTY PERCENT OF OUR STUDENTS HAVE TO WORK MORE THAN TWENTY HOURS A WEEK. UP AND I WOULDN'T CALL THOSE STUDENTS UNSUCCESSFUL BECAUSE THEY DON'T GET OUT IN TWO OR THREE YEARS. THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE THAT WAS IN THE STUDENT THE VISION FOR SUCCESS. IT SAID GOAL SHOULD BE USED TO MOTIVATE AND PROVIDE DIRECTION NOT PUNISH. THIS FORMULA'S IT'S WRITTEN RIGHT NOW IS SEVERELY PUNITIVE. I WOULD URGE THAT YOU PLEASE TAKE THE TIME TO STUDY IT LONGER. AND MAKE SURE THAT THE FUNDING FORMULA THAT WE DO COME UP. MEETS THE INTENT THERE IS A LAUDABLE INTENT BUT. STILL MAINTAINS. STABLE AND PREDICTABLE FUNDING WITHOUT SIGNIFICANTLY HARMING MANY OF THE DISTRICTS THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING JENNIFER BAKER WITH THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION. WE UNDERSTAND THE GOLD THAT. THE GOVERNOR'S TRYING TO ACHIEVE AND WE THINK IT'S A LOT OF LOCAL HERE TO TRY TO HAVE A STABLE FORMULA PARTICULARLY THROUGH TOUGH ECONOMIC TIMES. THEIR QUESTION THAT WE WOULD ASK REGARDING THE FIRST FIFTY PERCENT. IS IS THAT ENOUGH BASED ON THE EXPERIENCES THAT WE'VE HAD ON THE K. TWELVE SIDE WE REALIZED INITIALLY WHEN THE LC FF WAS CREATED. THE THOUGHT WAS THAT WOULD BE ENOUGH TO CARRY THE LONG TERM SYSTEMIC COST THAT THE SYSTEM NEEDED IN AS MANY OF YOU KNOW TO OTHER CONVERSATIONS WERE FINDING OUT NOW THAT WE HAVE TO DO SOME WHATEVER REVENGE. SO THE QUESTION WE WE'D LIKE TO POSE FOR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SIDE. IS FIFTY PERCENT GOING TO BE OUT NOW FOR THE LONG TERM SYSTEMIC IMPACTS IN COST INCREASES THAT OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE GOING TO HAVE OVER THE YEARS WE THINK IT WOULD BE A VERY THOUGHTFUL FISCAL PROCESS TO ANALYZE THAT TO MAKE SURE THAT BASE NUMBER IS GOING TO BE. ENOUGH. WE AGREE WITH MANY OF THE CONCERNS SET UP A REYES REGARDING. DUH HOLD HARMLESS PROVISION FOR ONE YEAR WE WOULD ASK IS THAT ENOUGH. AND WOOD OF THE IN THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES FOR THE WINNERS AND LOSERS BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN SIMILAR. CONSEQUENCES ON THE KEY TWELVE SITE FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LC FF WE DO UNDERSTAND THE INITIAL STUDENT. GRANT TO HELP STUDENTS IN NEED WE THINK THAT THERE WERE SOME VERY VERY REFLECTIVE COMMENTS FROM THE ALLEY YELLOW THAT WE'D URGE YOU TO CHEW ON WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE OTHER TWENTY FIVE PERCENT GRANT. IF THE GOAL IS STUDENT SUCCESS. WE CONCUR WITH MANY OF THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE BY PRE SPEAKERS ON TRYING TO UTILIZE METRICS THAT ENSURE STUDENT SUCCESS SAID HE'S FULL TIME FACULTY AND ACCESS FOR STUDENTS. CHAIR AND MEMBERS LA HABILIDAD I REPRESENT A NEXT GEN CALIFORNIA NEXT GEN PRIORITIZES ACCESS TO QUALITY EDUCATION AND TIME TO COMPLETION AND HOUSE WE CONTINUE THESE CONVERSATIONS I NEXT AND REALLY WANTS TO ENSURE THAT. DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS ARE REALLY PRIORITIZE AMBIENCE OR THINK YOU. I CHAIR MCCARTY CHAIR MEDINA MEMBERS LYRICALLY ZERO WITH THEIR COMMUNITY COLLEGE LEAGUE WE REPRESENT ALL SEVENTY TWO DISTRICTS IN HONOR AND FOURTEEN COLLEGES. AND WE ALSO HAD I HAD THE JOB. TO HELP SUPPORT THE THE CEO WORK GROUP THAT WAS TASKED SURVEYED THE GOOD THING IS I'M NOT GONNA TALK VERY LONG BECAUSE. YOU SHOULD HAVE ON YOUR DESK OUR REPORT. THAT ARE CONSTITUTES THIRD OF RECOMMENDATIONS AND ACTUALLY DEAN THIS CAME OUT JUST THIS PAST MONDAY I JUST A COUPLE THINGS I WOULD HIGHLIGHT IN AND. SINCE THIS JUST CAME OUT MONDAY THERE'S A DESIRE TO HAVE CONTINUING CONVERSATIONS BUT. I THINK WHAT YOU'RE HEARING A LOT ABOUT IS INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY SO ASSEMBLY MEMBER LIMO AND YOU ASKED THE KEY QUESTION WHICH I'M NOT TO BE ABLE TO ANSWER. BUT ABSENT INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO SERVE I ESPECIALLY THOSE TRADITIONALLY UNDER REPRESENTED AND MOST UNDERSERVED STUDENTS SO IN THE RECOMMENDATIONS BY THE CEO WORK GROUP. THERE IS. A STRONG RECOMMENDATION FOR BASS ALLOCATION RESOURCE AND THAT IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY NOT JUST FOR A NEW FUNDING FORMULA ALTHOUGH IT'S CRITICAL FOR PACKAGES SO THAT WE CAN. I DO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO EQUITY MINDED APPROACH TO TO FUNDING. AND ALSO YOU'LL SEE IN THE IN THE REPORT THAT THERE IS A PHASE AND THAT'S RECOMMENDED IN THIS PROCESS SO THANK YOU. SO MISTER GLAZE YES IF YOU COULDN'T MAYBE HANG OUT THERE BECAUSE I THINK YOU YOU ARE. KEY QUESTION IS THAT. WE WE HEARD IN THE LETTER FROM EL CAMINO RECEIVED A PHONE CALL FROM TO DISTRICTS OUTSIDE OF MY DISTRICT WE HEARD FROM THE PRESIDENT SHOULD BOW AND. AND YOU REPRESENT HUNDRED FOURTEEN. THIRTEEN FOURTEEN WHAT'S UNDER IT HUNDRED FOURTEEN YOUR FOR COLLEGES COLLEGES. AND HUNDRED FOUR DIFFERENT OPINIONS BUT. SOME VERY VOCAL VOICES SAYING. TOO FAST TOO MANY UNANSWERED QUESTIONS. BUT I'M NOT EVEN SLOW DOWN BUT THAT THE WAY YOU'RE GOING JUST DOESN'T QUITE WORK. SO. HOW COULD THE LEAK? IT IN IT THE CAPACITY. GO FORWARD WHENWHEN HERE'S SOME MUCH DISSENT. FROM YEAR ON FROM YOUR MEMBERS ACROSS CALIFORNIA RIGHT IT I AM TO BE CLEAR. OUT AND AS YOU'LL SEE IN THE REPORT THE CEO WORKGROUP IS NOT SAYING. I WE ARE A HUNDRED PERCENT SUPPORTIVE OF THE GOVERNOR'S FRAMEWORK AND PROPOSAL AS AN AND I THINK. UNDERSTANDABLY THERE WAS A VERY STRONG REACTION TO THAT PARTICULAR PROPOSAL IN THE FRAMEWORK AND THEN ONCE THE SIMULATIONS CAME OUT. THERE WAS A LOT OF DAMAGE DISEASE STRIKES SO THE CEO WORK GROUP THAT FRAMEWORK. AND TRY TO LOOK AT WHETHER THE KEYS THE ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS THAT MIGHT PROVIDE. A OUTCOMES BASED FORMULA. AND YOU'LL SEE IT'S PHASED AND SO WE HAVE GREAT DIVERSITY AMONGST OUR CEOS JUST AS WE HAVE GREAT DIVERSITY UP AT THE COLLEGE AND SO. ON. THIS IS. THESE ARE RECOMMENDATIONS. WITH. SOME SPECIFICITY ALTHOUGH. IT'S CLEARLY I AM. UNDERSTOOD THAT THESE THIS WOULD PROVIDE HARDING UNLESS ESTATE FURTHER COMMUNICATION SO. WE THE WORKGROUP HAS TRIED TO COMMUNICATE IT EVERY STEP OF THE WAY BUT UNDERSTANDING THAT IT'S REALLY BEEN A YOU KNOW ENOUGH IN A MONTH'S TIME SO THAT'S WHY THOUGH IN THE RECOMMENDATIONS. IT'S A PHASED IN PROCESS AND THE KEY IS. WHAT WE CALL OR THE WORKGROUP BECAUSE AN OVERSIGHT COUNCIL? WHICH WOULD DO AN ANALYSIS IN CONTINUAL ANALYSIS BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT OTHER STATES THEY ALL HAVE SOME KIND OF A GROUP THAT LOOKS AT UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES HOW DO WE CHANGE THE HYDRAULICS. SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A LITTLE BIT OF A LONGER IMPLEMENTATION IN LAST QUESTION EIGHT WORK IT IS TO US BUT. BUT SIMILAR TO WHAT WE HAVE IN LC FF IN QUAKE IN CAPE TWELVE. THE MULTI YEAR IMPLEMENTATION AND THAT. YOU KNOW SO OFTEN SOME OF THAT THE DESCENT SO DO YOU THINK THAT THAT THAT KIND OF FORMULA THAT YOU OUTLINED HERE AND ASSUMPTIONS FROM THE STATE. PARTICIPATION WILL MITIGATE SOME OF THAT CONCERNS FROM ACROSS CALIFORNIA. I THINK THE WORK GROUP BELIEVES THAT AGAIN THERE WAS A CONCERN ABOUT TIME IN DOING ANALYSIS SO. THAT SO. THE. I I GUESS THE ANSWER IS ABSENT SIMULATIONS AND EVEN WEEK WE HAVEN'T SEEN SIMULATIONS ARE OF. THIS TYPE OF APPROACH ABSENT SIMULATIONS WE WON'T KNOW I GET I GUESS WHAT I'M ASKING IS THAT. WHO IS THAT ARE WE COUNTING ON? CERTAIN REVENUE GROWTH AND PROPPING IT OVER LIKE A FIVE SIX YEAR PERIOD. THAT WILL MAKE IT PALATABLE AND WITHOUT THAT WHO STILL HAVE SEVERE PROBLEMS. WELL I THINK REGARDLESS OF THE FORMULA YOU HAVE IF WE HAVE SOME KIND OF A SEVERE PROBLEM BUT. AGAIN THE THERE ARE NO SIMULATIONS IN HERE SO WE DON'T KNOW THE EXACT IMPACTS BUT. YOU NEED SOME KIND OF BASE INCREASE. FOR THE INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY SO I GUESS THE SHORT ANSWER IS. YES WE NEED TO INCREASE THE INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY OF OF THE DISTRICTS. FOR THE NEW FUNDING FORMULA TO BE IMPLEMENTED SO ME JUST A REALLY QUICK EXAMPLE WITHOUT INSTITUTIONAL RESEARCH AND SOME OF OUR SMALLER COLLEGES DON'T REALLY HAVE A VERY VERY STRONG INSTITUTIONAL RESEARCH. YOU CAN DO THE DATA FORMED ANALYSIS THAT YOU WOULD NEED TO DO TO LOOKING ORGANIZATION AND FIGURE OUT HOW CAN WE. I. YEAH CHANGE WHAT WE'RE DOING SOUTH. AND I THINK APPS REGARDLESS OF THE FUNDING FORMULA FOR INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY THERE NEEDS TO BE. AT A BASE ALLOCATION INCREASE FOR THE COLLEGES SPREAD THE COSTS AND AND TO SERVE. STUDENTS THAT WE SERVE IT'S NECESSARY. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS STEPHANIE DOT ORG THE FACULTY ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE DEEPLY CONCERNED WITH THE PURPOSE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL. AS A RESULT FACT IS ACTUALLY DEVELOPED AN ALTERNATIVE. A FUNDING PLAN WHICH WE'VE DISTRIBUTED TO YOU WHICH SHOWS SIDE BY SIDE OUR PLAN. WITH THE ADMINISTRATION'S PLAN. WE ALSO PROVIDING YOU WITH A WELL RESEARCHED PIECE BY NICHOLAS HERMAN OF THE SENTRIES FOUNDATION. WHICH EXPLAINS HOW OUR PERFORMANCE BASED FUNDING. LIKE THE KIND IN THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL. ACTUALLY EXASPERATED STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT GAPS. THE FACT PLAN IS RESEARCH BASED AND DESERVES OUR CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING. MANY RODRIGUEZ ON BEHALF THE EDUCATION TRUST WEST HERE IN SUPPORT OF THE FUNDING FORMULA AS JUST THAT HE STARTED THE CONVERSATION ON HOW WE CAN MORE EQUITABLY FUND OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES. WE HEARD THAT THE CURRENT FUNDING FORMULA IS NOT WORKING. PARTICULARLY FOR LOW INCOME STUDENTS STUDENTS OF COLOR. ANY FUNDING FOR THEM FORMULA MOVING FORWARD SHE REALLY PRIORITIZE LOW INCOME STUDENTS STUDENTS OF COLOR UNDER OTHER UNDER REPRESENTED. AND UNDERPREPARED GROUPS PARTICULARLY ON ANY OUTCOMES PIECE ANY PROGRESS OF MILESTONES. AND WE'RE HERE TO REALLY TRY TO INFLUENCE AS MUCH POSSIBLE THINK THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS YOU GUYS TO PROCESS WITH THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION. ARMED WITH EVERY UP SCHOOL REFORM PROPOSAL THAT COULD BE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. AND NOW CONCERNED OF COURSE BECAUSE TO THE EMPLOYEES HEAVY DUTY I ASK YOU TO CONSIDER AS YOU EXPLORE THESE NEW FORMULAS AND THE IMPACT. TO THE EMPLOYEES TO CONSIDER. BUILDING OFF OF ITS EXISTING EXISTING LAW OPTIONS TO CREATE SOME TYPE OF BUDGET DISCUSSION AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. WITH KEY STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING CLASSIFIED SCHOOL EMPLOYEES BUT ALSO TO ALSO. A HAVE BASICALLY A SIGNED OFF BEFORE BODIES ARE BEING MOVED BECAUSE THE FARMERS HAVE CHANGE HOW MUCH IS BEING FUNDED FROM YEAR TO YEAR. HOW DO WE PROTECT THOSE EMPLOYEES WHO ARE BEEN GREAT WORKERS BUT DUE TO UPS AND DOWNS OF THEIR ENROLLMENT SAUTE UNINTENDED IMPACT OF THESE FORMULAS? WOULD JUST CUT OUT THEIR POSITION AND NOT TO CONSIDER OF A WAY TO MOVE THEM AROUND. SO WE WOULD ASK YOU TO CONSIDER US WE HAVE OUTLINED IN NOW BUDGET LETTER. TO HAVE A SIGN UP FOR THE EXCLUSIVE REPRESENTATIVE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL SO THAT AS THEY PARTICIPATE IN THE BUDGET PROCESS AND CD'S CHANGES. THAT THEY AT LEAST HAVE A CHANCE TO SAVE THOSE POSITIONS WHERE IT IT MERITS THEY'RE SAVING THANK YOU THANK YOU. CHAIR AND MEMBERS MARIA ALVAREZ WITH THE HISPANIC ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF THIS PROPOSAL. AS WE RECOGNIZE AND APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S ATTEMPT TO. LOOK AT COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS. DEMOGRAPHICS AND RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE LOW INCOME STUDENTS OTHER UNDER UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS AT THESE DISTRICTS ARE TRYING TO SERVE. AND TRYING TO ALLOCATE ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO SUPPORT THE STUDENTS UP FIRST AND FOREMOST WITH THAT SAID. THERE ARE SOME COMPONENTS OF THIS PROPOSAL THAT WE HAVE CONCERNS WITH. PROBABLY THE TWO BIGGEST ONES ARE THE OUTCOME MEASURES. WE BELIEVE STRONGLY THAT THOSE NEED TO BE ADJUSTED. AS. BEEN SAID BY OTHERS SPEAKERS I'D TO INCLUDE. PROGRESS TO A DEGREE MEASURES AND WAITED METRICS. THE SECOND WOULD BE TO INCLUDE OTHER UNDERREPRESENTED POPULATIONS I'M IN ADDITION TO THE LOW INCOME POPULATION. WHICH WOULD INCLUDE. FIRST GENERATION FOSTER USE SARAH THANK YOU. MAKE YOU TEAR. MEMBERS. NICHOLAS CHáVEZ ON BEHALF OF LONG BEACH COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT WE SUPPORT THE CONCEPT. OF THE NEW FIVE FORMULA WHICH FOCUSES ON IMPROVING SOON OUTCOMES. BUT IN ORDER IMPROVE SOON OUTCOMES DISTRICTS MUST NOT RECEIVE LESS THAN CURRENT LAW. AND THE FORMULA MUST BE PHASED IN OVER TIME THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU FOR THE FEEDBACK WILL. TAKE ALL THIS. INTO CONSIDERATION AS I'M SURE THAT THAT HARMONY FINANCE. WELL AS WELL ENDOWED WITH THAT WE ARE ADJOURNED THANK YOU
