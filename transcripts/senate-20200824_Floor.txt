SENATE BILL THREE SIXTY FOUR BY SENATOR MITCHELL AN ACT RELATING TO TAXATION TO TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY TAX LEVY. SENATOR MITCHELL THANK YOU SO MUCH MADAM PRESIDENT AND GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE SENATE BILL THREE SIX FOUR PERTAINS TO THE NONRESIDENTIAL ACTIVE SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX EXEMPTION. THIS BILL IS SIMILAR TO AB ONE OH FIVE WHICH IS PASSED OFF OUR FLOOR ON THE TWENTY FIFTH OF JUNE. TECHNICAL MINUTES WERE MADE IN THE ASSEMBLY TO ENSURE THAT THE EXEMPTION PROVIDED BY THIS BILL DID NOT GO BEYOND WHAT IS PROVIDED BY CURRENT LAW. AS A REMINDER. THIS BILL SEEKS TO PREEMPTIVELY CORRECT THE UNINTENDED IMPACT OF THE PROP FIFTEEN SPLIT ROLL INITIATIVE. IN THE UPCOMING NOVEMBER BALLOT ON NON RESIDENTIAL SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEMS IN THE STATE. EXISTING CALIFORNIA LAW PROVIDES EXEMPTION FROM TAXATION TO NONRESIDENT WRITTEN ON RESIDENTIAL ACTIVE SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEMS. INSTALLED OR CONSTRUCTED BEFORE JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE UNDER THE NEWLY CONSTRUCTION EXCLUSION UNTIL SUBSEQUENT CHANGE IN OWNERSHIP. THE PASSAGE OF PROP FIFTEEN WOULD RESULT IN THE REVOCATION OF THIS EXCLUSION RESULTED IN FULL MARKET VALUE ASSESSMENT OF NON RESIDENTIAL SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEMS. BEGINNING JANUARY FIRST OF NEXT YEAR. THIS BILL ENSURES THAT NON RESIDENTIAL ACT OF SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEMS ARE ALREADY RECEIVING THE EXISTING LAW EXCLUSION CONTINUE TO BE EXEMPTED FROM TAXATION BY RECLASSIFYING THEM AS PERSONAL PROPERTY. THIS BILL UTILIZES THE POWERS GRANTED TO THE LEGISLATURE BY SECTION TWO OF ARTICLE THIRTEEN OF THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION THE CLASSIFY PERSONAL PROPERTY FOR DIFFERENTIAL TAXATION OR EXEMPTION WITH A TWO THIRDS VOTE. THIS BILL BECOMES AN OPERATIVE IF PROP FIFTEEN IS NOT APPROVED AT THE STATEWIDE GENERAL ELECTION PRESERVING EXISTING LAW EXEMPTION FOR NON RESIDENTIAL SOLAR ENERGY GENERATION SYSTEMS. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR MITCHELL MEMBERS ANY DISCUSSION AND OR DEBATE. CENTER MORLOCK. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I. HAVING SERVED AS A TAX COLLECTOR TREASURER FOR THE COUNTY OF ORANGE- NOW WAS NOT THE ASSESSOR BUT I WAS. TRYING TO DETERMINE HOW THIS WOULD ACTUALLY WORK. AT THE COUNTY LEVEL HOW WOULD THE ASSESSOR. DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF THE COSTS THAT WAS ADDED TO THE- REAL PROPERTY AND THEN. GET YOU LOOK AT THE OVERALL AMOUNT OF THE REAL PROPERTY FOR YOUR ASSESSMENT. AND SO I WAS JUST CURIOUS ON THE MECHANICS OF HOW ASSESSORS ARE TO. SEPARATE THE TWO AND ONE WOULD BE DEPRECIATING OVER TIME THE OTHER MIGHT BE APPRECIATING OF THE OVERTIME WITH LANDED PROPERTY AYE. SO I WAS JUST JUST KIND OF TRYING TO THINK OF THE MECHANICS OF IT ALL I'M JUST WONDERING. MADAM PRESIDENT pBE A CLOSE REMARKS JUST TO KIND OF HELP ME OUT SO I CAN. THE I.

SEEING AND HEARING NONE SENATOR MITCHELL IN MY CLOTHES THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION FROM OUR COLLEAGUE FROM ORANGE COUNTY AND THIS BILL DOESN'T INCLUDE THE MECHANICS OF IT SIR TO BE QUITE HONEST THIS IS BEING PUT IN PLACE. IN THAT WE ARE- EXPECTED TO ADJOURN ON AUGUST THIRTY FIRSTIN THE EVENT THAT POP FIFTEEN PASSES NOVEMBER THIRD AND WE'RE NOT IN SESSION SO THIS IS A PREEMPTIVE MEASURE TO PREVENT- YOU KNOW CURRENT LAW FROM NO LONGER BEING APPLICABLE IF PROP FIFTEEN PASSES. I FULLY ANTICIPATE THAT COUNTY ASSESSOR'S SUCH AS YOU SERVE WILL THEN HAVE TO GET ME IN THE PROCESS OF FIGURING OUT HOW TO OPERATIONALIZE IT DIFFICULT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL BUT OUR STATE BILL THAT'S GOING TO THAT LEVEL OF DETAIL.

TO JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY SIX FOR THE LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT L. A. U. S. T. TO UTILIZE A BEST VALUE BID EVALUATION AND SELECTION PROCESS FOR PUBLIC WORKS PROJECTS IN EXCESS OF ONE MILLION DOLLARS. THIS PROCESS HAS ALLOWED LAUSD TO LOOK AT BITTERS BASED ON SAFETY FINANCIAL CONDITIONS INSURANCE COVERAGE CRIMES AND MISCONDUCT BONDING SETTLEMENTS AND JUDGMENTS. UNFORTUNATELY THE SELECTION OF A BITTER BASED SOLELY ON PRICE MAY RESULT IN PROJECT DELAYS AND COST OVERRUNS. AB NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE ALLOWS FOR MORE OBJECTIVE CRITERIA FOR SELECTING BIDDERS WHICH IS SHOWN TO YIELD POSITIVE BENEFITS IN SELECTING QUALIFIED CONTRACTORS. IN COMPETITIVE PRICES WITH BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN STATE AND LOCAL FUNDS BEING SPENT ON SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS THE LOS ANGELES UNIFIED IT IS VITAL THAT THE DISTRICT HAS THE NECESSARY TOOLS. TO REDUCE RISK AND MAXIMIZE EFFICIENCIES. EIGHTY NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE EXTENDS L. A. ULYSSES FORTY TO UTILIZE THE BEST VALUE PROCUREMENT METHOD FOR AN ADDITIONAL FIVE YEARS. ALLOWING THE STATE MORE TIME TO EVALUATE THE BENEFITS OF THIS MODEL AB NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE PASSED THROUGH THE ASSEMBLY EDUCATION COMMITTEE WITH NOTE NOTEBOOKS AND TO THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR WITH BIPARTISAN SUPPORT AND SIXTY SIX I VOTE.

MEMBERS WE'RE GONNA GO TO ONE FINAL ITEM ON BEHALF OF THE PRESIDING OFFICER TODAY AND THAT IS FILE ITEM ONE EIGHTY TWO CENTER LEYVA IS PREPARED TO PRESENT BETTER SECTOR CAN YOU PLEASE REPEAT. ASSEMBLY BILL NINETEEN FORTY SEVEN BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER KALRA AND ACTUALLY INTO EMPLOYMENT. GOOD AFTERNOON ONCE AGAIN CENTER LABOR THE FLOOR'S YOURS THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT. HELLO MEMBERS I RISE TODAY AGAIN 2% EIGHTY NINETEEN FORTY SEVEN WHICH EXTENDS THE FILING DEADLINE FOR RETALIATION CLAIMS WITH THE DIVISION OF LABOR STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT. D. L. S. C. FROM SIX MONTHS TO ONE YEAR THIS BILL ALLOWS PREVAILING EMPLOYEES IN CASES OF WHISTLEBLOWER RETALIATION CLAIMS THE ABILITY TO SEEK ATTORNEYS FEES AND THE LEGAL PROCESS. RETALIATION IS THE ONLY PERVASIVE BUT ALSO A GROWING PROBLEM TO THE CURRENT POLITICAL CLIMATE SURROUNDING IMMIGRATION. THE LAST FOUR YEARS OF AVAILABLE DATA FROM TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN TO TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN IMMIGRATION RELATED RETALIATION CLAIMS FILED WITH THE L. L. C. INCREASED BY NEARLY. TWO THOUSAND PERCENT. OMITS THE PANDEMIC ADVOCATES REPORT AN INCREASE IN CALLS REGARDING HEALTH AND SAFETY ISSUES AND WAGE THEFT IN THIS CLASSIFICATION. IT IS IMPORTANT IT IS AS IMPORTANT NOW AS EVER THAT WE ENSURE THAT ALL LEGAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE AVENUES ARE AVAILABLE FOR WORKERS WHO COME FORWARD. THE TWO MAIN BARRIERS THAT WORKERS FACE AND FILING A CLAIM ARE DRESSED IN THIS BILL ONE WORKERS WILL FACE RETALIATION ESPECIALLY IN EXTREME FORMS OF TERMINATION OR VIOLENCE. NEED MORE TIME TO GATHER THE RESOURCES AND SEEK ASSISTANCE TO A SIMPLE SIX MONTH EXTENSION FOR FILING A WORKER'S RETALIATION CLAIM WILL GIVE PEOPLE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONSIDER THE FUTURE OF THEIR LIVELIHOOD. AND THEIR NEXT STPS FOR RECOURSE AB NINETEEN FORTY SEVEN ALSO BUILT UPON THE EXISTING ABILITIES FOR COURTS TO AWARD REASONABLE ATTORNEY'S FEES TO ATTORNEYS WHO TAKE THESE CASES ON BEHALF OF WORKERS. THIS IS NOT A BILL THAT IS INTENDED TO INCREASE LITIGATION AS THE OPPOSITION ARGUES RATHER AB NINETEEN FORTY SEVEN PROVIDES AN ADDITIONAL SENSIBLE AND REASONABLE WAY FOR LOW WAGE WORKERS. TO PURSUE RECOURSE WHEN THEY HAVE BEEN UNFAIRLY RETALIATED. AGAINST FOR INVOKING THEIR RIGHTS UNDER THE LAW. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND I'VE- THANK YOU CENTRAL WE HAVE JUST OR DEBATE ON THE FLOOR WE'RE GONNA START OFF WITH CENTER BRIDGES GOOD AFTERNOON CENTER. BUT RISK PRESIDENT. WHEN THIS MATTER CAME BEFORE JUDICIARY. I ASKED SOME QUESTIONS. IN MY UNDERSTANDING THE BILL HASN'T CHANGED ALL THAT MUCH. BUT ONE OF THE CONCERNS I HAD IS THAT WHEN A PLAINTIFF IS ENTITLED TO ATTORNEY'S FEES IF THEY WIN. CONVERSELY WHAT A DEFENDANT BE ABLE TO COLLECT ATTORNEYS FEES IF THEY WIN MY UNDERSTANDING THE ANSWER'S NO. THE OTHER THING IS. I BELIEVE THIS PROBABLY WILL INCENTIVIZE LAWSUITS BECAUSE MY UNDERSTANDING BASED ALSO ON THE JUDICIARY DISCUSSION. IS THAT MANY OF THESE CAN BE RESOLVED OUT OF THE COMMISSION FOR OUT OF COURT AND WHEN THAT. APPRECIATING THIS AS A VOLUME APPROACH TO COLLECTING INDIVIDUALS TO FILE LAWSUITS IN THE PLAINTIFF OR DEFENDANT RATHER WILL BE INCENTIVIZED TO SETTLE THESE THINGS OUT OF COURT BECAUSE JUST THE SHEER COST OF LITIGATION SO I THINK THIS WILL ACTUALLY IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S FAIR BECAUSE YOU DO HAVE INDIVIDUALS. WHO DON'T HAVE THE FINANCIAL WHERE WITH ALL TO HIGHER INTEREST ON TO WORK TO BE ABLE TO ADVOCATE ON THEIR OWN BEHALF THAT THEY MUST HIRE AN ATTORNEY. THAT THE ADVANTAGE IN THE LEVERAGED TO BE WITH THE DEFENDANT WHICH IS THE CORPORATION. BUT IF WE'RE GOING TO BE FAIR I THINK THAT WE SHOULD ALSO ALLOW FOR THOSE DEFENDANTS WHO HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT THAT WOULD BE A FRIVOLOUS LAWSUIT THAT THE TO BE ENTITLED TO THEIR ATTORNEYS FEES. AND I THINK THAT IS A CHALLENGE NO DOUBT MY ESTEEMED COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA BARBARA IS GOING TO STAND UP RIGHT NOW POSSIBLY EVEN HER ANOTHER. IF COLLEAGUES BUT I THINK THIS IS THE DISCUSSION WE DON'T HAVE THE BRITISH RULE SYSTEM IN THE US I UNDERSTAND THAT WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE ENTITLE THE PREVAILING PARTY TO COLLECT ATTORNEYS FEES. BUT IF WE THINK THAT THIS IS NOT INCENTIVIZE LAWSUITS IN ALSO SETTLEMENTS WILL BE SORELY MISTAKEN. THANK YOU SO MUCH CENTER GORGEOUS- I KNOW CENTER LATER YOU'LL TAKE THAT IN YOUR CLOTHES I'M SURE WE'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY OTHER DAY DIGITAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THE FLOOR. GOOD AFTERNOON CENTER JACKSON. YES I KNOW IT'S HARD TO SEE BEHIND THE PLEXIGLAS YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW HARD IT IS TO HEAR. THE PLEXIGLASS BUT I DID HEAR THAT- LAST UP. ARGUMENTUM WE DID HAVE THIS DISCUSSION. IN THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. THE UNITED STATES OPERATES ON THE AMERICAN SYSTEM. AND THAT IS A SYSTEM WHERE. WHEN YOU HAVE RELATIVELY UNEQUAL BALANCE IN A DEBATE IN A DISPUTE. THE PLAINTIFF IF THEY PREVAIL. IS ENTITLED TO ATTORNEY'S FEES. HOWEVER THE COURT ALWAYS HAS DISCRETION. AND I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT WE KEEP HEARING ABOUT FRIVOLOUS LAWSUIT. I OFTEN SAY THAT. THE MANTRA THE MEME IS EVERY LAWSUIT AS A FRIVOLOUS LAWSUIT AND EVERY LAWYER IS A GREEDY TRIAL LAWYERS. BUT THAT ISN'T THE CASE AND THIS IS JUST A FALSE AND INACCURATE- A MESSAGING- BECAUSE THE COURTS ALWAYS HAVE THE AUTHORITY. TO EITHER REDUCE OR DENY REQUESTS FOR ATTORNEYS FEES. AND IN THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION IF THE LAWSUIT IS DEEMED FRIVOLOUS BY THE COURT THEN ATTORNEYS FEES ACTUALLY CAN BE GIVEN TO THE DEFENDANT AS THE PREVAILING PARTY SO I REALLY HOPE. THAT AS WE PROCEED WE RECOGNIZE. THAT SO MUCH OF THIS IS JUST FALSE PROPAGANDA. THE COURT REALLY HAS THE DISCRETION YOU WILL NOT SEE FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS BECAUSE THE PARTY BRINGING THEM IS SUBJECT TO A ESSENTIALLY PUNITIVE ACT MEANING THAT THEY END UP HAVING TO PAY THE COST. OF THIS IS A SITUATION. WE'RE WHICH IS TRYING TO BALANCE OUT. BETWEEN A WORKER WHO IS THE SUBJECT OF RETALIATION FOR DOING SO. THAT THEY ARE LAWFULLY ENTITLED TO DO BY AN EMPLOYER WHO IS. A TRY TO IN THAT RIGHT SUPPRESSANT INTO AGAINST IT AND IT IS THE WORKERS RIGHT TO BRING IN A- OR TO RECOGNIZE. I SHOULD SAY UP WIN A RAW HAS BEEN COMMITTED AGAINST THEM- UNDEREMPLOYMENT LOS AND WHEN THE RETALIATED AGAINST THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO BRING INACTION IN THAT REGARD THE WHOLE POINT IS TO. IS TO DISCOURAGE THAT KIND OF MISUSE OF POWER THAT THE EMPLOYER HAS THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES WE HAD AN INTERESTING DISCUSSION AS WE ALWAYS DO WITH THE GOOD SENATOR FROM. FRESNO IS OFFICIAL. YES FROM FRESNO BUT IT IS A VERY DIFFERENT WAY OF LOOKING AT THINGS AND I WOULD SUBMIT TO YOU THAT THERE IS A REASON FOR THE AMERICAN SYSTEM AND THIS I IT AND THANK GOODNESS WE DON'T HAVE THE BRITISH SYSTEM. BECAUSE I CAN'T IMAGINE AS A LAWYER HAVING TO PUT ON A- ROBE IN A WHITE WEEK SO AMONG OTHER REASONS THIS IS A GOOD BILL AND I WOULD RESPECTFULLY. ALSO ASK FOR YOUR I. PHONE THANK YOU SO MUCH SENT JACKSON MEMBERS WE BACK TO GET A SEAT ANY THIS. OR DEBATE ON THE FLOOR. FINAL DISCUSS OR DEBATE ON THE FLOOR. HERE IN C. NINE CENTER LABELED LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT I THINK THAT THE GOOD SENATOR FROM SANTA BARBARA WAS FORMER ELOQUENT IN HER LEGAL BACKGROUND DESCRIPTION TO THE SENATOR FROM FRESNO I HOPE THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION. BUT I WOULD JUST SAY THIS. 2000% RETALIATION CLAIMS FROM IMMIGRANTS HAVE GONE UP 2000% NOT TO NOT TWENTY NOT TWO HUNDRED. TWO THOUSAND AND AS SOMEONE WHO REPRESENTED WORKERS FOR TWENTY YEARS WE HAD EMPLOYERS WHO USED TO WORRY ABOUT REFERRALS LAWSUITS. I USED TO TELL THEM.

THANK YOU MADAM THE PRESIDENT GOOD AFTERNOON AND- EIGHTY NINE NINETY TWO SIMPLY CLARIFIES THAT MEMBERS OF LOCAL ELECTED BODIES. MAY ENGAGE ON SOCIAL MEDIA PROVIDED THEY DO NOT INTERACT IN ANY WAY THAT VIOLATES THE RALPH M. BROWN ACT MORE SPECIFICALLY AB NINE NINETY TWO ALLOWS MEMBERS TO USE SOCIAL MEDIA PROVIDED THAT A MAJORITY OF THE MEMBERS DO NOT DISCUSS AMONG THEMSELVES BUSINESS OF A SPECIFIC NATURE THAT IS WITHIN THE SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION OF THE LEGISLATIVE BODY OF THE LOCAL AGENCY WILL EVOLVING FORMS OF COMMUNICATION AND PARTICIPATION IN SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS. LOCAL OFFICIALS HAVE INDICATED THAT IT IS UNCLEAR WHAT IS ALLOWED WHEN INTERACTING WITH THE PUBLIC ON SOCIAL MEDIA SOMETHING NOT CONSIDERED WHEN THE RALPH M. BROWN ACT WAS FIRST ENACTED IN NINETEEN FIFTY THREE. THE NEW MICRODOSING ASPECT OF SOCIAL MEDIA IS THAT IT GIVES CITIZENS NEARLY FULL ACCESS TO THEIR ELECTED OFFICIALS PRIOR TO THE ADVENT OF SOCIAL MEDIA CONSTITUENTS ONLY ACCESS WAS TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT TO SEE THEIR LOCAL ELECTED HAPPEN TO RUN INTO THEM OUT AND ABOUT OR ATTEND COUNCIL MEETINGS. THIS BILL DOES NOT ENCOURAGE NOR ALLOW LOCAL OFFICIALS TO DELIBERATE WITHOUT NOTICE ON SOCIAL MEDIA BUT INSTEAD PROVIDES STRUCTURE AND CLARITY HE INTERACTIONS THAT ARE MOST LIKELY ALREADY HAPPENING ONLINE TO EXCLUDE SOCIAL MEDIA PARTICIPATION HARM CIVIC ENGAGEMENT AND DOES A DISSERVICE TO THE PUBLIC WHILE UNDERMINING TRANSPARENCY FOLLOWING RECENT AMENDMENTS THERE IS NOW NO OPPOSITION TO AB NINE NINETY TWO I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL COLLEGE THANK YOU THANK YOU CENTER. MEMBERS AND OR DEBATE CENTREBOARD. THIS THANK YOU FOR COULD THROUGH A ON UNITED TO POST QUESTION JUST FOR CLERK.

IN ON INTERNET. WE'RE ON THE SAME RATE WHICH NOT IT DOESN'T KNOW FOR SHE COULD. IT JUST ALLOW FOR THE- IN AND SO MEDIA. EXACTLY WHAT ALLOWED TO COME. ON SUBJECT MATTER THAT IS PERTINENT FOR INVOLVED EXACTLY THAT'S NOT ALLOWED. ALL RIGHT SO IF YOU HAD JUST BY WAY OF EXAMPLE LET'S SAY YOU HAVE A FIVE MEMBER BOARD LIKE A BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. AND LOCAL ENTITIES LIKE MUNICIPALITIES AND COUNTIES ARE BOUND BY THE BROWN ACT. IF SOMEONE PUTS OUT ON SOCIAL MEDIA. OPPOSITION TO. DEVELOPMENT ACTS. IN THREE OF THOSE SUPERVISORS PARTICIPATE IN THIS. SOCIAL MEDIA LET'S CALL IT LET'S SAY FACEBOOK EXCHANGE. ON THIS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT. HOW WOULD THAT PLAYED ITSELF OUT HERE THAT'S NOT WHICH LAW IT'S NOT NO OKAY. THAT'S NOT THAT'S THIS IS JUST ALLOWING HE PARTICIPATION WITHIN THAT SOCIAL MEDIA WITHIN THAT PLATFORM BUT NOT IN INTERACTION ON A SUBJECT MATTER THAT'S PERTINENT OR. INVOLVED WITHIN THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS OKAY SO THAT WOULD BE TO FOR TO. IN A DISCUSS OR DIALOGUE AMONG THEMSELVES ON SOCIAL MEDIA WHAT ABOUT THE USE OF INTERMEDIARIES LIKE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. NO I DON'T BELIEVE THAT WOULD BE ALLOWED TO EITHER YOU COULD LISTEN TO THE CONVERSATIONS. BUT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ALLOWED TO MAKE THOSE. DETERMINATIONS NOR HAVE THE ABILITY TO DISCUSS ARGUE. DIALOGUE WITH YOUR COLLEAGUES IN THAT ENVIRONMENT FORGIVE ME FOR LYING- ROUNDING IT ON THIS POINT FURTHER ONLY BECAUSE SOCIAL MEDIA SO PREVALENT. AND SO MANY ELECTED OFFICIALS ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT ARE BETTER WITHIN THE BROWN ACT- OBLIGATION. IF THERE'S A DEVELOPMENT PROJECT. AND MULTIPLE MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS ARE DRAWN IN BY TAGGING ON SOCIALMEDIA. SAYING PLEASE SUPPORT. OUR PIECE OF LEGISLATION ACCESS COMING THROUGH THE COUNTY AND SUPERVISOR ONE TWO AND THREE AT SOME POINT. INVOLVES THEMSELVES IN THAT CONVERSATION BY EXPRESSING THEIR OPINION OR HOW THE VOTE.

YOU SHOULD BE GETTING MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS THERE'S A VERY VERY IMPORTANT COMPONENT TO THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WHICH I HARDLY SUPPORT AND THAT'S THE CONSERVATION EASEMENT FOR OF THE AREA THAT IS IN SOUTH ORANGE COUNTY THAT IS HAS EXTREMELY HIGH CONSERVATION VALUES IN IT BECAUSE SOMETHING THAT I'VE WORKED ON NOW ANOTHER AREA AN ORANGE COUNTY WHEN I WAS A MEMBER OF THE ORANGE COUNTY TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY FOR ABOUT EIGHT YEARS WE WERE ABLE TO PRESERVE ABOUT ELEVEN HUNDRED ACRES.

THANK YOU IN A PRESS ARE ARE RIGHTS TO AB FIFTY ONE ON BEHALF OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER WORKS AB TWO FIFTY ONE WILL ALLOW HOUSING DEVELOPMENT- I HAVE. WHAT TO BE THAT ON BASED PROPERTIES TO ELIMINATE PARKING SPACES AND WOULD ALLOW RELIGIOUS USE PARKING SPACES TO COUNT TOWARDS LOCAL PARKING REQUIREMENTS FOR HOUSING RELIGIOUS COMMUNITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA ARE EXPRESSING INTEREST IN BUILDING HOUSING ON THEIR EXISTING PROPERTY INCLUDING ON A CHASE ON PROPERTY ADJACENT TO THEIR EMPTY PARKING LOTS IN ORDER TO EASE CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING CRISIS. HOWEVER PLANS TO BUILD NEW HOUSING ON RELIGIOUS PROPERTIES OFTEN FACED ROADBLOCKS INCLUDING INCLUDING LOCAL ZONING REGULATIONS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON IS THE LOCAL REQUIREMENTS FOR RELIGIOUS USE PARKING LIMIT ABILITY TO COUNT AVAILABLE- PARKING TOWARDS RESIDENTIAL PARKING REQUIREMENTS ARE PARKING REQUIREMENTS INCREASE CONSTRUCTION COSTS AND CREATE A FINANCIAL BARRIER FOR NONPROFITS SUCH AS RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS WHO WOULD LIKE TO INCREASE THE OVERALL HOUSING SUPPLY. AB EIGHTEEN FIFTY ONE WILL FACILITATE THE HOUSING PRODUCTION THAT OUR STATE DESPERATELY NEEDS- BY REDUCING PARKING REQUIREMENTS ON RELIGIOUS PROPERTIES FOR QUALIFYING HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS OF THIS BILL HAS RECEIVED TREMENDOUS SUPPORT FROM LOCAL COMMUNITIES OF FAITH NONPROFIT AND SO FORTH I RESPECT ASK FRONT.

ASSEMBLY BILL NINETEEN FIFTY BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER COME LONGER AND ACTUALLY INTO PROBATION. SENATOR MITCHELL THANK YOU MUCH MATTER PRO I RISE TO PRESENT A NINE FIFTY R. A. B. THAT IS ONE OF THE PRIORITY BILLS FOR THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS ON BEHALF OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER KAMLAGER IT WOULD CREATE A REASONABLE AND EVIDENCE BASED LIMIT ON PROBATION TERMS SETTING A MAXIMUM PROBATION PERIOD OF ONE YEAR FOR MISDEMEANOR OFFENSES. AND TWO YEARS FOR SOME FELONY OFFENSES THE BILL EXEMPTS CRIMES COMMITTED AGAINST MONETARY PROPERTY VALUED AT OVER TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND ANY SPECIFIC CRIMES WITH PROBATION TERM LENGTH AND IDENTIFIED BY STATUTE WHICH INCLUDES THE WHY IS THE MESSAGE BONTA FENCES AND STRIKE FELONY OFFENSES. MANY SEX CRIMES AS WELL AS OTHER TYPES OF CRIMES ARE INELIGIBLE FOR PROBATION BY STATUTE AND ARE THEREFORE ALSO EXAM. PROBATION CAN ONLY BE GRANTED TO INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE CONVICTED OF A CRIME. AB NINETEEN FIFTY RETAIN JUDICIAL DISCRETION I RECOGNIZE THE PROBATION CAN STILL BE REVOKED BY JUDGE FOR SUBSTANTIVE VIOLATIONS. IF AN INDIVIDUAL COMMITS A NEW CRIME ON PROBATION THEY WILL BE SENTENCED TO NEW TIME. SUBURBAN SYSTEMS. WHAT IS THE TO SUPPORT AND CONNECT THEM TO ESSENTIAL COMMUNITY SERVICES TO FACILITATE SUCCESS CALIFORNIA SYSTEM CURRENTLY DOES THE OPPOSITE. NEARLY ONE QUARTER OF CALIFORNIA'S PRISON POPULATION IS BEHIND BARS FOR VIOLATING THE TERMS OF THEIR PROBATION OR PAROLE COSTING THE STATE TWO BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY PART OF THAT EXPENSES TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE MILLION TO INCARCERATE PEOPLE FOR VICTIMLESS TECHNICAL VIOLATIONS SUCH AS BREAKING CURFEW ARE MISSING AN APPOINTMENT WITH THE SUPERVISION OFFICER. CRIMES THAT PEOPLE NOT I'M PROBATION WOULDN'T THINK TWICE ABOUT. THIS SYSTEM DISPROPORTIONATELY HURTS PEOPLE OF COLOR AND PARTICULARLY BLACK PEOPLE WHO MAKE UP 80% OF THE STATE'S RURAL POPULATION BUT 23% OF PEOPLE ON PROBATION. PEOPLE LIKE RUSSIA BROKE WHO STRUGGLE TO FOR WORK PAPER AND COURT FEES FEARING THAT WITHOUT PROPER. HE MAY NEVER ENTER SOCIETY FULLY UNFORTUNATELY DIDN'T GET THAT CHANCE IN JUNE OF THIS YEAR HE WAS SHOT AND KILLED BY POLICE OFFICER IN THE WENDY'S PARKING LOT. OR PEOPLE LIKE ULISES RIGHT. WHO HAD HIS PROBATION EXTENDED BECAUSE HE COULD NOT COMPLETE HIS FINAL TWELVE HOURS OF COMMUNITY SERVICE. HELPING TO CLEAN THE BEACH BECAUSE OF THE COLD AT NINETEEN PANDEMIC. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT PROBATION SERVICES SUCH AS MENTAL HEALTH CARE AND ADDICTION TREATMENTS ARE MOST EFFECTIVE DURING THE FIRST EIGHTEEN MONTHS OF SUPERVISION THOSE WHO COMMIT A NEW CRIME DO SO WITHIN THE FIRST TWO YEARS WHERE THEY CAN BE CHARGED UNDER THIS BILL. PROVIDING INCREASE THE PROVISION OF SERVICES EARLIER REDUCES AN INDIVIDUAL'S LIKELIHOOD TO RECIDIVISTS. OPPOSITION TO A B. NINETEEN FIFTY AGREE WITH THE POLICY IN FACT THEY SUPPORTED IT IN THE GOVERNOR JANUARY BUDGET. THEIR CONCERN IS THAT REDUCE PROBATION TERMS WILL RESULT IN REDUCED FUNDING FOR PROBATION DEPARTMENTS. SB SIX SEVEN EIGHT WOULD SET UP THE FUNDING FORMULA FOR WITH FOR PROBATION DEPARTMENTS THROUGHOUT THESTATE AS A PERFORMANCE BASED MODEL. LIMITING TERMS SHOULD NOT AND DOES NOT LIMITED DEPARTMENTS ABILITY TO SUPPORT PEOPLE ON PROBATION WITH PROGRAMMING AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND ACCESS AND ACCESS THE INCENTIVE BASED THE FUNDING AND SB SIX SEVEN EIGHT. AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PROGRAMMING NOT HOW LONG SOMEONE IS ON PROBATION. AB NINETEEN FIFTY PROVIDES THE IMPETUS FOR COUNTIES TO REDESIGN PROBATION PROGRAMS BASED ON PRESUMING SUCCESSFUL OUTCOMES. CONTRA COSTA COUNTY IN STATES LIKE LOUISIANA AND MICHIGAN ARE ALREADY THINKING PROBATE RETHINKING PROBATION AND LOWERING THEIR RECIDIVISM RATE SUCCESSFULLY. IT'S TIME WE PUT REFORM APPROBATION SYSTEM FOR DECADES PROBATION HAS HELPED EXACERBATE THE VERY REAL AND MISTRUST THAT DEFINE MANY COMMUNITIES INTERACTION WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. AB NINETEEN FIFTY WOULD REDUCE RECIDIVISM BUT PUT PEOPLE ON A SPRINGBOARD TO SUCCESS AND ENCOURAGE AND EXPAND EVIDENCE BASED ANTI RECIDIVISM PROGRAMS. IT WOULD ENABLE LAW ENFORCEMENT TO PROVIDE MORE EFFECTIVE SERVICES AND REDUCE UNNECESSARY CONTACT WITH THE PUBLIC. MOST IMPORTANTLY IT WOULD MAKE COMMUNITIES SAFER I ASKED FOR AN ADULT.

ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY NINE SIXTY SEVEN BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER O'DONNELL AN ACT RELATING TO PUBLIC EMPLOYEES RETIREMENT CENTER PAM THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT CENTERS I'M ALSO PLEASED TO PERCENT AB TWENTY NINE SIXTY SEVEN BY SOME MEMBER OF DONALD WHICH CLARIFIES THAT A PUBLIC AGENCY MAY NOT AMEND ITS CONTRACT WITH CALPERS. EXCLUDE GROUPS OF EMPLOYEES THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY INCLUDED UNDER THAT CONTRACT. CIVIL SERVICE THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA CONTRIBUTE A PORTION OF THEIR EARNINGS TO THE CALPERS PENSION TRUSTING THAT THEIR INVESTMENT PROVIDE A SECURE RETIREMENT. FORTUNATELY SOME LOCAL AGENCY OF THE SITE TO GAMBLE ON A RISKY MODEL THAT THE PRICE PUBLIC EMPLOYEES OF A SECURE RETIREMENT BY AMENDING THE CONTRACT EXCLUDE CERTAIN GROUPS OF EMPLOYEES. FROM CALPERS BENEFITS. LIMITING ACCESS TO CALPERS BENEFITS ROB'S CRITICAL PUBLIC SAFETY WORKERS OF THEIR PENSION BENEFITS AND FINANCIAL SECURITY THEY DESERVE. AND COULD DESTABILIZE RETIREMENT FUND FOR ALL EMPLOYEES. AB TWENTY NINE SIXTY SEVEN IS A NARROWLY TAILORED BILL TO ENSURE PUBLIC AGENCIES USE THE CALPERS AMENDMENT PROCESS AS INTENDED. NOT TO CUT OUT PARTICULAR GROUPS OF EMPLOYEES FROM THEIR SECURE RETIREMENT BENEFITS. THAT RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER PAN MEMBERS ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE SENATOR MORLOCK. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT-CALLING SAID DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS ARE READY LOBSTER TRAPS FOR. THE PUBLIC SECTOR ONCE YOU WALK IN YOU JUST CAN'T GET OUT AND YOU TRY LEAVE CALPERS. THEY FORCED PLAN SPONSORS TO TRUE UP IMMEDIATELY. AND THIS IS EXTREMELY DISINGENUOUS BY. PLAN ADMINISTRATOR BECAUSE THEY KEPT THEIR INVESTMENT RETURN ASSUMPTIONS ARTIFICIALLY HIGH TO KEEP CONTRIBUTIONS LOW. SERVICE SORT OF A ACTUARIAL MALPRACTICE FOR RETIREMENT SYSTEM PROVIDER SO CITY DECIDED TO MAKE A FISCALLY PRUDENT MOVE BY DROPPING. A AN EXPENSIVE FIRE THIRTY AND RESTARTING THEIR OWN INTERNAL FIRE DEPARTMENT. THE TWIST THEY PROVIDED A DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN WHICH IS A MORE APPROPRIATE STRATEGY IN PURSUING A SHARED RISK APPROACH TO RETIREMENT PLANS- THIS IS THE FUTURE IS NOT THE ONLY MUNICIPALITY OR ENTITY THAT HAS A DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN FOR ITS FIRE DEPARTMENT. AB TWO NINE SIX SEVEN WANTS TO FORECLOSE ON THIS PRUDENT AND FAIR FISCAL STRATEGY AND THIS WOULD BE A TRAGIC MOVE ESPECIALLY WHEN CITIES TRY TO RECOVER FROM THE COBIT NINETEEN LOCKDOWN. SACRAMENTO SHOULD NOT REMOVE LEGITIMATE AND FINANCIALLY FEASIBLE ALTERNATIVES IT'S WRONG. IT'S BULLYING IT'S REMOVING A CLEVER FROM THE CITIES AND COUNTIES THAT SHOWS THAT THE LEGISLATORS LEGISLATURE IS TONE DEAF TO THE FINANCIAL STRESSES AROUND THE STATE WE'RE SEEING CITIES REDUCE THEIR FIRE DEPARTMENTS BY 25% ALREADY JUST BECAUSE OF BUDGET CONSTRAINTS. IT ALSO SHOWS WHO'S RUNNING THE SHOW AROUND HERE IT IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO HAVE UNION PRESSURE DEMAND HOW ARE DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN SHOULD WORK WHEN THE PENSION MELTDOWN FINALLY ARRIVES. MANY WILL LOOK AT THIS BILL SHOULD PASS IS ONE OF THE NAILS IN THE COFFIN. CONSEQUENTLY MADAM PRESIDENT I URGE A NO VOTE ON S. B. TWO NINE SIX SEVEN THANK YOU THANK YOU CENTER MORLOCK MEMBERS ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. SEEING AND HEARING THE ANSWER PAN YOU MAY CLOSE. I WOULD JUST SAY THE FIRST OF ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT LED TO THIS BILL WHICH BY THE WAY THIS BILL I WOULD NOT ACTUALLY AFFECT- WHAT HAPPENED IN THE CITY PALENCIA A RELEASE CLOSING A LOOPHOLE BECAUSE BASICALLY WE TELL LOCALITIES YEAH ARE YOU IN CALPERS OR YOU'RE NOT AND THAT'S PART OF MAINTAIN STABILITY OF THE RETIREMENT SYSTEM AND ALSO ENSURING THAT. WE TREAT ALL EMPLOYEES IN A LOCALITY EQUITABLY JUST HAPPENS THAT THERE IS A UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT GAVE THE CITY- PERHAPS AN OPPORTUNITY THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE- TO BASICALLY TREAT EXCEPT A GROUP OF EMPLOYEES AND FOURTEEN THE FIREFIGHTERS THE ONES WHO ARE YOU KNOW PEOPLE OUT THERE AND FIGHTING. FIRES FROM BEING GETTING THE BENEFITS THAT THE OTHER EMPLOYEES HALF AND SO I THINK THAT IN THE POINT OF FAIRNESS- I WOULD ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU.

DON'T DON'T TOUCH IT. OKAY. THIRTY FOUR CAMP THAT OKAY YOU'RE IN THE ARE A LIKE. THANK YOU MADAM. I AM PROUD TO BE. AB FIFTEEN TWELVE WHICH PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED CLARITY TO THE SECURITY INDUSTRY AND ENSURE WE CAN BETTER PROTECT THE WORKERS OUR PUBLIC SAFETY BY PROVIDING GUIDANCE TO EMPLOYERS SECURITY OFFICERS ARE OFTEN THE FIRST TO RESPOND TO AN EMERGENCY ON PREMISE AND THEN CALL FOR ASSISTANCE FROM POLICE OR FIRE OR AMBULANCE WHEN NECESSARY. THEY ARE AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF OUR PUBLIC SAFETY AND THE NATURE OF THE WORK OFTEN REQUIRES THAT THEIR PRESENT AT ALL. AB FIFTEEN TWELVE WILL REQUIRE SECURITY OFFICERS UNDER COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS TO REMAIN ON PREMISE AND MONITOR RADIOS DURING REST PERIODS AND IT WOULD PERMIT THE SECURITY OFFICER TO RESUME THEIR REST PERIOD AS SOON AS IT IS PRACTICAL SHOULD THAT PERIOD BE INTERRUPTED. ADDITIONALLY IF ON ANY WORK THEY A SECURITY OFFICER IS NOT PERMITTED TO TAKE AN UNINTERRUPTED REST BREAK OF AT LEAST TEN MINUTES FOR EVERY FOUR HOURS WORKED THEN THE SECURITY OFFICER SHALL BE AID ONE ADDITIONAL HOUR PAY AT THE REGULAR RATE. THIS BILL WILL PROVIDE CLARIFICATION FOR THE EMPLOYER ON A PROCESS SHOULD THEY NEED TO INTERRUPT THE SECURITY GUARDS REST BREAKS WE HAVE RECEIVED BIPARTISAN SUPPORT AND NO OPPOSITION I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN IDOL THANK YOU THANK YOU CENTER DORADO MEMBERS ANY. DISCUSSION AND OR DEBATE. SEEING AND HEARING NONE MEMBERS THERE ANY OF. CENTER GROVE. I WAS JUST SAYING GO GO GO. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I APPLIED AGAIN THIS AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD- YOU KNOW PAPA LAWS RESTRICTED LAWS NUMEROUS CREED RACE RECOVERY PERIODS FOR EVERY EMPLOYER IN THE STATE IS DEVASTATING BECAUSE THERE ARE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF- BUSINESSES SUCH AS A- COMPANION CARE WHEN YOU TAKE CARE OF A DISABLED- JUST AND THE SECURITY GUARD. ISSUE THERE'S A LOT OF BUSINESSES AND OF THEM WHO IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO STOP IMMEDIATELY WITHIN THAT TIME FRAME TO TAKE THEIR BREAK MEAL AND RESPIRATOR RESTORING EVERY PERIOD. AND DOESN'T PROVIDE FLEXIBILITY IN OUR NORMAL- LABOR CODE TO HAVE ANY FLEXIBILITY WHATSOEVER SO LIKE A SINGLE MOM THAT WANTED TO IN DEBT YOU KNOW THREE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON AND TAKE FOR OUR LUNCH BREAK AT THE END OF THE DAY THERE'S JUST ZERO FLEXIBILITY. AND SO THIS ACTUALLY- I REALIZE YOU HAVE TO BE UNDER COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT BUT THIS ACTUALLY DOES PROVIDE FLEXIBILITY FOR AT LEAST SECURITY GUARDS I THINK WE SHOULD TAKE THIS MOMENT EVEN TO REALIZE THAT OUR LABOR CODE IN THE STATE IS SO OVERBURDENED SEND AN EMPLOYEE SHOULD HAVE MORE OF A CHOICE AND IT SHOULDN'T BE CATERED TO JUST COLLECTIVE BARGAINING UNITS IT SHOULD BE. ACROSS THE BOARD TO CREATE FAIRNESS FOR ALL EMPLOYERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT THIS IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND- SO I WOULD URGE AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR GROPING ANY FOR JUST.

ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY TO THIRTY ONE BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER KALRA AN ACT RELATING TO PUBLIC WORKS CENTER MONEY THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS AB TWENTY TWO THIRTY ONE DEFINES WHEN A PUBLIC SUBSIDY IS TO MINIMUS FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING IF THE PREVAILING WAGE APPLIES TO PRIVATE PROJECTS USING PUBLIC FUNDS. UNDER CURRENT LAW THE TERM DE MINIMUS IS NOT DEFINED IN STATUTE SO THERE'S NO GUIDANCE FOR INDUSTRY OR REGULATORS AS TO THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF PUBLIC SUBSIDY THAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED DE MINIMUS AND THIS IS LEAD TO LITIGATION. THIS BILL PROVIDES THAT A PUBLIC SUBSIDY ON A PRIVATE PROJECT IS DE MINIMUS SO LONG AS IT IS LESS THAN SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN LESS THAN 2% OF THE TOTAL PROJECT COST. TO ADDRESS OPPOSITION CONCERNS THE AUTHOR AMENDED THE BILL TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF PUBLIC SUBSIDY THAT WILL TRIGGER PREVAILING WAGE FROM FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS TO SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS UNDER CURRENT LAW IN NINETEEN UNDER THIS BILL NO DEVELOPER IS REQUIRED TO TAKE A PUBLIC SUBSIDY OVER THE DE MINIMUS AMOUNT IF THEY DO NOT WANT TO PAY THE PREVAILING WAGE. THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS PUT GREAT FINANCIAL STRAIN ON OUR WORK FORCE MANY WORKERS HAVE BEEN LAID OFF HAD THEIR HOURS REDUCED ROOF TAKEN UNPAID LEAVE TO CARE FOR THEIR FAMILY IT IS MORE CRITICAL THAN EVER BEFORE THAT OUR WORKERS IN THE TRADES EARN DECENT WAGES AND RECEIVE QUALITY TRAINING. ON THESE-PROJECTS MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU CENTER MONNING MEMBERS ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE SENATOR GROWTH. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. I RISE IN OPPOSITION OF THIS BILL BUSINESSES ARE SHATTERING- AROUND OUR STATE. AND SOME- ARE NOT EVEN GONNA BE ABLE TO RE OPEN. WE NEED A VIBRANT ECONOMY TO BE ABLE TO GET US OUT OF THE SITUATION THAT WE FIND OURSELVES IN BECAUSE OF CODE AND NOT HAVING BUSINESS BEEN OPERATIONAL. SINCE BASICALLY MARCH. THIS BILL PLACES ADDITIONAL BURDENS AND COST ON- BUSINESSES STRUGGLING TO STAY OPEN. AND WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE HOUSING CRISIS IF PRIVATE BUSINESS ENTERPRISE- WANTS TO BUILD HOUSING FOR THE HOMELESS WHICH WE NEED TO ADDRESS BECAUSE CALIFORNIA HAS 50% OF THE NATION'S AND SHELTER. AND ARE HOMELESS POPULATIONS CAN DRASTICALLY INCREASING. WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO BUILD HOUSING FOR HOMELESS AT A VERY- COST EFFECTIVE WAY AND I'M NOT SAYING THE LOWEST BIDDER I'M SAYING. A GOOD QUALIFIED CONTRACTOR THEY CAN BUILD HOUSING FOR HOMELESS THEY CAN MAKE SURE THAT- YOU KNOW WE HAVE ADEQUATE HOUSING FOR HOMELESS POPULATION THERE SHOULDN'T BE A MANDATE ON IT FOR A PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENTS OR PREVAILING WAGE. SO THAT HOUSING CAN BE HILL BILL BECAUSE NEED TO HAVE MORE BILLS NOT LIST HOUSING BILLS. THE CURRENT LAW DOES A GOOD JOB OF BALANCING COMPETING INTEREST IN USING CONSIDERATION- FOR- CONSIDERATION OF PROPORTIONS. M. AND R. EIGHTY TO TWENTY TO THIRTY ONE PROJECTS ACCEPTING SUBSIDIES IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM WILL NOT BE ALLOWED- IT WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO GET AWAY FROM THIS- THIS PREVAILING WAGE REQUIREMENT. SO IF YOU HAVE A CHURCH FOR INSTANCE THAT WE JUST PASSED A BILL. AND THEY WANT TO BUILD HOUSING ON THEIR PROPERTY IN ORDER TO HOUSE THE HOMELESS AND THEN OFFER WRAPAROUND SERVICES BECAUSE THE FAITH COMMUNITY WILL GENERALLY DO THAT. SO THAT WE CAN GET PEOPLE NOT JUST IN HOUSING TO GET THEM WELL ON THEIR WAY TO A SUCCESSFUL LIFE- THIS WILL AFFECT THE CHURCH FACILITIES THAT ON A BILL THAT WE JUST PASSED TO ALLOW CHURCHES TO BE ABLE TO HOUSEHOLD HOMELESS. POPULATIONS OR BUILD HOUSING FOR HOMELESS. I JUST THINK AGAIN AS WE LOOK AT THE CO PANNED. WE DON'T KNOW RESTRICT BUSINESS OR COST TO HAVE A- COST BURDENS. WE JUST NEED TO BUILD UP AGAIN THIS BILL I KNOW IT'S NOT JUST FOR BUILDING HOUSING BUT I'M JUST FOCUSING ON THAT BECAUSE THE LAST FEW BILLS THAT WE JUST PASSED. I JUST THINK THAT WE NOT NEED TO RESTRICT BUSINESS FROM BEING ABLE TO. GARNER SUBSIDIES TO DO WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE TO MAKE SURE THAT- WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO AGAIN HOUSE HOMELESS. AND I CAN DO IT IN A PROPER WAY SO THANK YOU I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NUMBER. THANK YOU SENATOR GROSSING NO FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE SENATOR MONNING WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. SHOULD APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE THAT I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR. THIS BILL DOES NOT CREATE PREVAILING WAGE THAT IS STATE LAW IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THIS BILL PROVIDES CLARIFICATION OF WHAT CONSTITUTES A DE MINIMUS PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION. IN IN NEGOTIATIONS THAT LEVEL WAS RAISED TO PROTECT LOWER COSTS FROM BEING BOUND BY PREVAILING WAGE SO AGAIN. THIS BILL MEMBERS DOES NOT CREATE PREVAILING WAGE THAT EXISTS WITH PUBLIC SUBSIDIES IT WILL ACTUALLY SAVE MONEY. BY KEEPING PARTIES OUT OF EXPENSIVE AND TIME CONSUMING LITIGATION BY HAVING A DEFINED. THRESHOLD THAT TRIGGERS THAT PREVAILING WAGE. THE MINIMUS. LEVEL SO FOR THOSE REASONS MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR MONNING MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

UNDER MOTIONS AND RESOLUTIONS. ALL RIGHT THIS IS THE APPROPRIATE TIME FOR THE ADJOURN IN MEMORY THAT IS ON OUR CALENDAR SENATOR MITCHELL. COLLEAGUES IT IS WITH IMMENSE SADNESS THAT I STAND AND SHARE PERHAPS FOR THE FIRST TIME WITH MANY VIEW THAT A MEMBER OF OUR ESTEEMED LEGISLATURE THE HONORABLE GLENMORE. PASSED AWAY LAST WEEK. HE WAS FIRST ELECTED IN. NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT. END OF MY COLLEAGUES IN THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS NO WE KEEP COUNT OF THE WOMEN WHO WERE ELECTED TO THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE AND IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT. WHEN WAS THE TWENTY SECOND WOMAN ELECTED TO THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSEMBLY. HE WAS THE FOURTH AFRICAN AMERICAN MEMBER. HE WAS A PROLIFIC LEGISLATOR WITH OVER FOUR HUNDRED BILL SIGNED INTO LAW THROUGH THE COURSE OF HER CAREER IN THE ASSEMBLY AND MY COLLEAGUE MY SEAL B. C. COLLEAGUE FROM GUARDINO WILL GO INTO GREATER DETAIL ABOUT SOME OF HER- NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED LEGISLATION AND HER HISTORY MAKING COMMITTEE THAT SHE CHAIR. I'M GONNA SPEND A LITTLE TIME TALKING ABOUT- GLENN MISS MORE THE LEGISLATOR MENTOR AND FRIEND. SHE SERVED IN A NUMBER OF LEADERSHIP CAPACITIES WITH MANY OF OUR AFFINITY ORGANIZATIONS. HE WAS A LEADERSHIP ELECTED LEADERSHIP OF THE NATIONAL CONFERENCE OF STATE LEGISLATORS. HE WAS A FOUNDING MEMBER OF AN ORGANIZATION NOBEL WOMEN THE NATIONAL ORGANIZATION OF BLACK ELECTED LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S. IN THE EARLY NINETIES THE ORGANIZATION NOW BOASTS A MEMBERSHIP OF ALMOST THREE HUNDRED BLACK FEMALE STATE LEGISLATORS ACROSS THE COUNTRY DUE IN LARGE PART TO MISS MORRIS TO RELIGION SUPPORT AND MENTORSHIP. HE TAUGHT IN WAS AN ACTIVE PARTICIPANT IN THE CENTER FOR THE AMERICAN WOMEN AND POLITICS AT RUTGERS UNIVERSITY NEW JERSEY. WHERE ONCE AGAIN SHE CONTRIBUTED TO THEIR MOM MANY YEARS OF LEADERSHIP TRAINING AND RESEARCH. AROUND ELECTED WOMEN AT THE STATE LEVEL. HE WAS AN ACTIVE MEMBER OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE NATIONAL BLACK CAUCUS OF STATE LEGISLATORS. WITH CLOSE FRIENDS WITH MANY OF ITS FOUNDERS IN THAT ORGANIZATION IN LARGE PART DUE TO HER MENTORSHIP INTO LINK YOUR RECRUITMENT. NOW BOASTS A MEMBERSHIP OF SEVEN HUNDRED BLACK LEGISLATORS. IN ALL FIFTY STATEHOUSES ACROSS OUR COUNTRY. SHE WAS A PAST SPEAKERS APPOINTEE TO THE CALIFORNIA STATE BAR. SHE WAS THE RIGHT HAND TO BETTY JO TO KOHLI AS A BOARD MEMBER FOR THE CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESS ASSOCIATION HE CHAIRED THE CALIFORNIA BLACK BUSINESS ASSOCIATION. RUN BY MR SKIP COOPER. HE WAS A FORMER HER FIRST ELECTED OFFICE WAS THAT OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE TRUSTEE IN LOS ANGELES. TO THE NATIONAL BOARD OF THE N. DOUBLE ACP AND FIRST VICE CHAIR OF THE STATE CONFERENCE OF IN DOUBLE ACP RUN BY ALICE HOFFMAN. HE WAS A STRONG SUPPORTER OF LONG TERM MENTOR OF MINE MANY WOMEN. WHO ARE ACTIVE IN LA PINE LAW PACKED THE LOS ANGELES ALPHANUMERIC WHEN PUBLIC INSTITUTE. AND THOSE ARE BUT A FEW OF THE ACTIVITY SHE ENGAGED IN WHEN SHE LEFT THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSEMBLY BEFORE TERM LIMITS. TO RUN FOR STATEWIDE OFFICE SHE RAN FOR SECRETARY OF STATE AND DID NOT WIN. CLEARLY MISTER MOORE DIDN'T LET ANY GRASS GROW UNDER HER FEET AND HER. WHAT LEGISLATIVE RETIREMENT HE RAN A GYM A PR FIRM AND WAS ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN ADVOCACY AROUND SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT IN THE UTILITIES. HER MENTORING STYLE COULD BE BOTH DIRECT AND INDIRECT. AS SHE STOOD PROBABLY MAYBE FIVE FOOT ONE ON A GOOD DAY. OUR VERY OWN DIANNE GRIFFITH HERE TO. STORY WITH ME THAT SOUNDS VERY UCH LIKE MISS MOORE DIçN CAME TO THE LEGISLATURE NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE A FORMER PUBLIC DEFENDER WAS THE FIRST FEMALE CONSULTANT TO THE ASSEMBLY PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE. HE WAS FORCED DOWN KIND OF IN THE HIERARCHY OF COMMITTEE CONSULTANTS HAVING BEEN ONE I CERTAINLY KNOW HOW THAT IS. AND SHE SAID IT WAS MISS MORE WHO DEMANDED OF THE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE BYRON SHARED THAT. DIANNE BE THE ONE TO PROVIDE HER WITH HER WEEKLY BREAK BRIEFINGS. REALLY ELEVATING DIANE'S RELEVANCE IN THE EYES OF THE COMMITTEE CHAIR. I FIRST MET MISS MORRIS THE CORAL FELL I WAS ASSIGNED TO HER AND LITTLE DID I KNOW AT THE TIME BUT SHE KNEW. THAT SHE AND MY MOTHER HAD BEEN JUVENILE PROBATION OFFICERS TOGETHER ALL WHEN I WAS A VERY VERY YOUNG CHILD. AND HE'S FOLLOWED MY CAREER AND SUPPORTED ME EVER SINCE. I HAD THE DISTINCT HONOR OF SHARING OF LA TIMES FRONT PAGE PHOTO OF HER ON DECEMBER SEVENTH OF TWENTY TEN WHEN I WAS TAKING MY OATH OF OFFICE TO THE ASSEMBLY. HE'D BEEN SUPPORTIVE OF MY CANDIDACY. I REALLY ENJOYED LECTURING ME POINTING UP FROM HER FIVE FOOT ONE STATUS. HE CAME ON TO THE FLOOR SHORTLY AFTER WE TOOK. OUR OATH OF OFFICE TO ASK ME WHAT COMMITTEES I HAD BEEN ASKED I HAD ASKED THE SPEAKER TO APPOINT ME TO. SHE SAID I KNOW YOU YOUR MOTHER IS A SOCIAL WORKER YOU ON TRACK FOR HUMAN SERVICES AND THAT'S NOT WHERE YOU SHOULD GO. YOU SHOULD GO FROM OF THE POWER COMMITTEES. YES MISS MORE OF COURSE HE CALLED THE KID. SO SHE WALKED IN THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR I THINK SHE'S COMING TO CONGRATULATE ME. AND THAT I JUST TAKEN THE OATH OF OFFICE TO THE SEAT SHE HAD REPRESENTED FOR SIXTEEN YEARS. AND SHE HOPES SIX A FINGER AT ME AND SAID. I ASK THE SPEAKER. AND HE TOLD ME YOU HAVE YOU MISTER. AND I. YOU MADE HIM. MESS AND DON'T APPOINT YOU THERE. AND THE PHOTO IN THE LA TIMES IS ME FALLING OUT LAUGHTER. AND SHE LAUGHING AS WELL. WE SHARED MANY MANY MANY LAUGHS FROM THAT DAY FORWARD. HE LEAVES BEHIND TO CHERISH HER MEMORY HER DEVOTED HUSBAND OF TWO YEARS RON DOBSON SENIOR. THEIR ONLY CHILD HER SON LITTLE RON IS THE COLUMN AND LITTLE RON STANDS ALMOST SIX SIX. GRANDCHILDREN NIECES AND NEPHEWS A BROTHER IN LAW. M. A. VAST HOST OF THE LEGISLATORS FROM ACROSS THE COUNTRY I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY CALLS CAME IN OF LEGISLATORS FROM ACROSS THE COUNTRY. YOU KNOW MANY STATES THAT DON'T HAVE TERM LIMITS LIKE WE DO MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE STILL SERVING IN LEGISLATORS WHO SERVED WITH CAN'T GO AND GOT TO KNOW HER THROUGH HER LEADERSHIP WITHIN SEE A SALE GOT TO KNOW HER WITH HER NATIONAL LEADERSHIP AROUND PUBLIC UTILITIES. EXPRESSING THEIR ABSOLUTE UTTER SHOCK AND DISMAY AND DEEPENED PROFOUND SADNESS. HER FRIENDS HER MENTEES HER HEY KIDS KIDS WE'LL ALL MISS MISS HER DEEPLY. HE HAD A CORE GROUP OF WOMEN JOY ATKINSON WHO WAS WORK WITH HER IN JUVENILE PROBATION AND THEN LETS HER DISTRICT DIRECTOR WHO WAS STILL CONSULTING WITH HER JIM COMMUNICATIONS NOW AND THE STATE CORE GROUP ALICE HUFFMAN OF WOMEN ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY. WHO LOOK TO GLENN. AS THE BRIDGE SHE WAS THE BRIDGE BETWEEN. LEGISLATORS OF A PAST ERA. AND LEGISLATORS TODAY. HE WASN'T A NATIVE OF LOS ANGELES HE MOVED TO LA AT THE AGE OF FIVE BUT SHE KNEW LA LIKE THE BACK OF HER HAND AND SHE LOVED THE CITY OF ANGELS DEEPLY. IT IS WITH DEEP DEEP SADNESS IN A TRUE SENSE OF LOSS OF A MENTOR SHIP AND KIND OF A NORTH STAR GUIDE. THAT I ASK THAT YOU JOIN ME AND MY COLLEAGUE IN THE JOURNEY IN MEMORY. OF FORMER ASSEMBLYWOMAN OF THE FORTY SEVENTH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT. MISS GLENN MORE. THANK YOU SENATOR MITCHELL SENATOR BRADFORD. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND I TO RISE IN ASKS THAT THIS BODY ADJOURN AND THE MEMO OF MISS MORE. A INDIVIDUAL WHO HAS MIKE FROM LH SERVED NOT ONLY AS AN AMAZING LEGISLATURE. LEGISLATOR BUT AS A- MENTOR AND A FRIEND TO ME AND MANY OTHERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE NATION. I REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME I. THOUGHT ELECTED OFFICE IT WAS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT FOUR WATER BOARD SEAT. AND I WAS RUNNING AROUND LOOKING FOR SOMEONE TO CALL ELECTED OFFICIALS FOR SUPPORT. AN OUT OF BLUE MISS MOORE WAS THE FIRST INDIVIDUAL TO NOT ONLY ENDORSED ME BUT SAID COME TO MY OFFICE AND HE SUPPORTED ME FINANCIALLY AS WELL I LOVE TELLING THE STORY OF THE BIGGEST. CHECK I'D EVER RECEIVED AND I WAS BLOWN AWAY BY HER. GENEROSITY BUT MISS MOORE'S LEGACY HERE AND THIS LEGISLATURE WILL LIVE ON AS MY COLLEAGUE STATED SHE PASSED OVER FOUR HUNDRED BILLS AND I CHALLENGE ANY OF US HERE WHO'LL DO THE TWELVE YEARS OR EVEN POSSIBLY THE FOURTEEN YEARS EVEN MATCHED HALF OF THOSE NUMBERS THAT SHE GOT SIGNED INTO LAW. BUT TO THE CRAWLERS THE MOST IMPACTFUL THAT ARE STILL HAVING AFFECTS NOT ONLY YEAR ON THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT ACROSS THE NATION WAS. HER BILL THAT CREATED LIFELINE TELEPHONE LIFELINE WHO IS KNOWN AND STILL KNOWN AS THE MORE LIFE LINE NO. THAT PROVIDED AFFORDABLE PHONE SERVICES FOR POOR AND SENIOR CITIZENS IT IS STILL A TOOL THAT IS USED TODAY IS STILL A MEASURE THAT WE ARE CONTINUALLY. ARE SUPPORTING AN ACID TO BE. EXPANDED UPON BUT WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT BRIDGING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE MISS MOORE WAS THE FIRST ONE TO REALLY TALK ABOUT THE NEED OF ACCESS FOR THOSE AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES AND LOW INCOME. BUTANOTHER PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT HAS GROWN AND BY LEAPS AND BOUNDS WAS EIGHTY THIRTY SIX. OF SEVENTY EIGHT. ALL WHICH IS NOW KNOWN AS JOURNAL ORDER ONE FIFTY SIX. IT CREATED THE SUPPLIER CONTRACTING. AND PROCUREMENT FOR MINORITY OWNED WOMEN OWNED AND DISABLED VETERANS AND IS EXPANDED NOW TO ADD LGBT OVER THE NUMBER OF YEARS DALLAS PASSED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR AND NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR UTILITIES WERE SPENDING LESS THAN A HALF MILLION DOLLARS. WITH MINORITY OWNED OR WOMEN OWNED BUSINESSES TODAY THEY WILL EXCEED OVER TWELVE DISTRIBUTED TO MISS MORE AND FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO KNOW MY POLITICAL CAREER I. CONSTANTLY ADVOCATED. FOR THE EXPENSIVE GENERAL ORDER ONE FIFTY SIX IT WAS BALLOT LANGUAGE THAT WE WERE ABLE TO PUT INTO SB ONE A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO A BIG AT THE GAS TAX. FOR ON HIGHWAY TRANSPORTATION BILL AND IT WAS THAT LANGUAGE THAT WE ANSWERED IT WAS SIMILAR LANGUAGE THAT WE INSERTED INTO SUPPLIER DIVERSITY FOR OUR INSURANCE INDUSTRY TWO YEARS AGO BECAUSE OF MRS MORE LEADERSHIP. AND AS MY COLLEAGUE STATED SHE WAS. ALWAYS CHALLENGING ME WHEN I GOT TO THE LEGISLATURE IN TWO THOUSAND NINE AND I WAS GIVEN THE CHEER OF UTILITIES AND COMMERCE IN TWO THOUSAND TEN MISS MORE COULD HAVE BEEN ANY PROBLEM. AND SHE WAS QUICK TO CALL ME AND CONSTANTLY GIVE ME ADVICE AS TO WHAT I SHOULD AND SHOULD NOT DO AS CHAIR OF UTILITY COMMERCE AND SHE WAS QUICK TO MAKE SURE THAT I WAS SITTING ON SOME PANELS SOMEWHERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ADVOCATING FOR THE EXPANSION OF GENERAL ORDER ONE FIFTY SIX OR CLOSING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE OR MAKING SURE. OUR UTILITIES WERE WAS AFFORDABLE AND ADVOCATING FOR ALL THOSE THINGSTHAT SHE TRULY BELIEVE IN AND SHE CHAMPION. THE YEARS BUT- WHAT STICKS OUT MOST FOR ME IS THE DIVERSITY THAT YOU SEE IN THIS INDUSTRY TODAY. BECAUSE THIRTY SOMETHING YEARS AGO WILL MISS MORE WHICH CHAIR OF UTILITIES AND COMMERCE WHERE SHE SERVED FOR TWELVE YEARS. SHE DREW A LINE IN THE SAND. BECAUSE THIRTY FOUR YEARS AGO. THIS IS A WHITE MALE DOMINATED INDUSTRY AS IT RELATES TO THE REPRESENTATION IN A LOGGING OF THE INSURANCE. YOU TELL THE INDUSTRY. AND SHE DREW A LINE IN THE SAND AND SAYS IF YOU'RE COMING TO LOBBY ME AS- HERE OF UTILITIES YOU MUST. WHITE HOUSE MINORITIES ANY MYSELF WOMEN. SO EVERY MINORITY TODAY WHETHER YOU'RE IN A HOUSE. OR CONTRACT LOBBYIST WHO'S A PERSON OF COLOR OR WOMAN OR GRATITUDE THANKS TO MISS MORE THE W. FOUR MEANS OF THE WORLD THE CAROL BILL HUNDREDS OF THE WORLD THE MISSY JOHNSONS OF THE WORLD THE P. HERNANDEZ IS OF THE WORLD THEY WOULD NOT. PROBABLY EXISTS TODAY. IF IT WASN'T FOR MISS MORE OR THE HIRING INTERNALLY I WORK AT A UTILITY. BEFORE COMING HERE AND IT WAS BECAUSE OF MRS MORE STRONG ADVOCACY FOR DIVERSITY IN THE UTILITY SPACE THAT WE SEE THE DIVERSITY THAT STANDS HERE TODAY SO. IT IS WITH GREAT SORROW BUT GREAT PRIDE THAT I A JOURNEY IN HER MEMORY BUT INDIVIDUAL AGAIN WHO HELPED SHAPE MY LIFE. NOT ONLY POLITICALLY BUT PERSONALLY WHO WAS ALWAYS AS MY COLLEAGUE SAID THAT GUIDING STAR MAKING SURE I DID THE RIGHT THING AND WHEN I DID SEE WAS QUICK TO PICK UP THE PHONE AND CALL ME. AND LET ME KNOW IF SHE WAS DISAPPOINTED IN SOMETHING I DIDN'T DO OR SOMETHING I SHOULD HAVE DONE. AND SHE WAS A STRONG COURAGEOUS ADVOCATE FOR ALL THOSE THINGS THAT. WE ALL SHOULD HOLD TO REPRESENT ANY ATTEMPT FIVE AS AN ELECTIVE COURSES SYOSSET WE TURN IN THE MEMORY OF. WHEN MORE. THANK YOU SENATOR BRADFORD WE DO HAVE A COUPLE OTHER MEMBERS THAT WANT TO SPEAK SENATOR NIELSEN IS FIRST KATHLEEN AND THEN. NUMBER AGAIN THEN YOURSELF SENATOR NIELSEN SENATE PRESIDENT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE. I TO. GRIEVE THE PASSING. OF WHEN. RIGHT COLLEAGUES FROM LOS ANGELES MENTIONED TO ME EARLIER IN THE WEEK- LAST WEEK THAT- SHE HAD PASSED IT WAS KIND OF A SHOCK. DID I GOTTEN USED TO GLENN ALWAYS BEING AROUND. KNOW WHAT I MEAN BY THAT WE CAME TO THE LEGISLATURE THE SAME YEAR SHE WAS I THINK AT THAT TIME ONE OF ONLY MAYBE TEN OR SO WOMEN WHO'D EVER BEEN ELECTED TO THE ASSEMBLY. AND THAT SAME YEAR DIANNE WATCH BECAME THE SECOND WOMAN. EVER ELECTED TO THE STATE SENATE. LATER THAN THERE WERE MANY IF YOU SEE THOSE PICS NOW GROWN ENORMOUS. BUT GLENN AND HER STATURE HAS BEEN ACKNOWLEDGED. I ALWAYS SAW HER OF THE WORD THAT BEST DESCRIBE HER PERSONALITY WAS PART. AND BRILLIANT. AND I FOUND OUT AND SHE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST PEOPLE IN THE ASSEMBLY THAT I BEGAN TO WORK WITH AS A CONSERVATIVE SENATOR FROM NORTHERN CALIFORNIA SHE BEING AN URBAN LEGISLATOR. FROM LOS ANGELES. BUT WE FOUND THAT WE HAVE MUCH IN COMMON. AND OVER THE DECADES WE DID A LOT OF THINGS TOGETHER CO AUTHORING BILLS. AND WHEN SHE LEFT THE LEGISLATURE. I ALWAYS LOOK FORWARD TO WHEN SHE MIGHT POP UP AGAIN AND SHOULD SHOW UP IN THE CHAMBERS AND I ALWAYS RUN BACK AND IN THOSE DAYS YOU COULD DO THE A BRAZO WITHOUT GETTING IN TROUBLE- AND I WE pALWAYS HAD BIG HUG BIG SMILES AND HER PERSONALITY JUST NEVER CHANGED. BUT SHE WAS AN INDIVIDUAL WHEN MORE WHO DID MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THIS INSTITUTION. NOT JUST THE LEGACY OF THE LEGISLATION. THAT MY COLLEAGUES MUSTANG VERSUS CHAU APTLY ACKNOWLEDGED. BUT THE COUNTRY CONTRIBUTION TO THE CONDUCT OF BUSINESS IN THIS HOUSE HOW SHE DEALT WITH OTHER MEMBERS IN BOTH HOUSES. VERY GRACIOUS VERY SHARP VERY CANDID WITH YOU ABOUT ADVICE AS TO HOW THINGS NEEDED TO GO IF YOU HAD A BILL IN HER COMMITTEE IT WASN'T JUST UP OR DOWN SHE WOULD. TALK WITH YOU ABOUT. THERE WAS A CHANCE TO AMENDED IN A MANNER ACCEPTABLE THEN WE WOULD ALWAYS BE ABLE TO WORK TOGETHER. AND AGAIN AS WE PROCEED NOW. AND I CAN FEEL HER PRESENCE EVEN WITH US HERE TODAY. STANDING WHEN MORE ALWAYS BE LOOKING BACK AT THE CHAMBER TO SEE WHEN STANDING THERE. AND GOING BACK TO GIVE HER A HUG. SHE IS A WOMAN WHO MADE A BIG DIFFERENCE. THEY SHOULD BE WITH THE LORD AND OUR FAMILY OR FAMILY BE COMFORTED. NIELSEN SENATOR UMBERG. MEMBERS ARISES SOMEONE WHO SERVED IN THE ASSEMBLY WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER MORE. THIRTY YEARS AGO WHEN I CAME TO THE ASSEMBLY I WAS THE ONLY DEMOCRAT ELECTED FROM ORANGE COUNTY AND SUITABLE A LOST SOUL AND I WASN'T HERE LONG AND ASSEMBLY WOMAN MORE INVITED ME TO COME TO DINNER AND A MOVIE WITH A MARGUERITE ARCHIE HUDSON THERESA HUGHES. AND BARBARA LEAD THE FOUR OF THEM AND I DON'T KNOW IF THEY INVITED ME TO COME BECAUSE THEY WANTED SOME COMIC RELIEF OR THEY WERE EDUCATING ME OR WAS LIKE BRING A LOST PUPPY TO A PICNIC. BUT THEY BROUGHT ME ALONG TO MOVIE AND DINNER AND I REMEMBER THAT SHE TOOK ME UNDER HER WING AND SHE STARTED TO EDUCATE ME ABOUT THE WAYS THE LEGISLATURE VERY DEDICATED SMART HARD DRIVING. BUT I REMEMBER THAT PERSONAL TOUCH IN TWO OR THREE DINNER SHE BROUGHT ME TO WITH THAT SAME GROUP THANK YOU FOR THE SAME REASONS. AND THEY WOULD DEBATE LEGISLATION. VERY HEATED. BUT THE MOST HEATED DEBATE I RECALL WAS ONE NIGHT AFTER A MOVIE WHERE THEY GOT QUITE ANIMATED AND THAT WAS OVER DENZEL DENZEL OR WESLEY. AND I DON'T REMEMBER WHICH SIDE WHEN WAS ON BUT EVERYONE WAS VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT THAT ISSUE. AND SO I RISE BECAUSE- SHE LEFT A MARK SHE LEFT A MARK ON THE LEGISLATURE SHE LEFT A MARK ON ME. MAY SHE REST IN POWER THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER AMBERG CENTER GALGIANI.

I KNEW VERY LITTLE ABOUT THE STATE'S COMMITMENT TO THE SMALL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM AND SHE GAVE ME THE HISTORY AND POINTED ME TO PREVIOUS LEGISLATION HELP ME TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WOULD BE IMPORTANT GOING FORWARD AND WHILE IT WAS NOT THE LEGISLATURE THAT ACTUALLY CRAFTED THE FINAL PRODUCT SENATOR KERN PRICE WHO WAS IN THE SENATE AT THE TIME AND MYSELF WE HAD WE EACH HAD BILLS WE WERE DOING WORKSHOPS ACROSS THE STATE.
