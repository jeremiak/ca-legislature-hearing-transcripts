FOUNDATION OF OUR LOCAL HEALTH

01:14:25.227 --> 01:14:27.362
DEPARTMENTS AND- HAVE CONTINUED

01:14:27.429 --> 01:14:29.164
THE DIALOGUE ON POLICY AND

01:14:29.231 --> 01:14:30.399
IMPLEMENTATION OF MANY OF

01:14:30.465 --> 01:14:32.601
THESE- DIFFERENT POLICIES I

01:14:32.668 --> 01:14:34.269
THINK WE CONTINUE TO LEARN AND

01:14:34.336 --> 01:14:36.104
ADAPT THOSE POLICIES. AS WE

01:14:36.171 --> 01:14:37.539
WORK WITH OUR SIXTY ONE LOCAL

01:14:37.606 --> 01:14:39.541
HEALTH JURISDICTIONS BUT AS YOU

01:14:39.608 --> 01:14:41.276
KNOW THERE ARE SIXTY ONE LOCAL

01:14:41.343 --> 01:14:43.412
JURISDICTIONS AND SOMETIMES

01:14:43.478 --> 01:14:44.279
WHAT THEY'RE SEEING ON THE

01:14:44.346 --> 01:14:45.414
GROUND HAS BEEN DIFFERENT IN

01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:47.516
DIFFERENT PLACES AND SO I THINK

01:14:47.583 --> 01:14:49.117
THAT IS SOMETIMES A IFFICULT

01:14:49.184 --> 01:14:50.385
AS WE TRY TO CREATE STATE

01:14:50.452 --> 01:14:52.621
POLICIES. TO MAKE SURE WE'RE

01:14:52.688 --> 01:14:54.923
TAKING INTO ACCOUNT- DOES SIXTY

01:14:54.990 --> 01:14:56.458
ONE DIFFERENT- PICTURES ON THE

01:14:56.525 --> 01:14:57.893
GROUND AND SO WE'VE DONE OUR

01:14:57.960 --> 01:15:00.729
BEST TO. ALLOW FLEXIBILITY WHEN

01:15:00.796 --> 01:15:02.798
WE CAN AND TO HAVE STATEWIDE

01:15:02.865 --> 01:15:04.399
POLICY WHEN WE NEED TO AND I'LL

01:15:04.466 --> 01:15:06.602
GIVE SOME EXAMPLES OF WHAT I

01:15:06.668 --> 01:15:08.971
THINK THE WORST EXCESSES SO I

01:15:09.037 --> 01:15:11.173
THINK WHEN WE MOVED TO- TORN

01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:12.608
AWAY FROM THE VARIANTS AND SOME

01:15:12.674 --> 01:15:14.109
OF THE EARLY STAGES INTO THE

01:15:14.176 --> 01:15:16.311
BLUEPRINT FRAMEWORK. I THINK

01:15:16.378 --> 01:15:17.512
THAT WENT A LONG WAY AND

01:15:17.579 --> 01:15:19.181
PUTTING EVERYBODY ON THE SAME

01:15:19.248 --> 01:15:21.116
PAGE AS TO WHAT TO EXPECT WHAT

01:15:21.183 --> 01:15:22.651
WOULD OPEN AND WHEN AND WONDER

01:15:22.718 --> 01:15:24.019
WHAT CONDITIONS AND I THINK

01:15:24.086 --> 01:15:26.421
THAT TRANSPARENCY LEADS TO A

01:15:26.488 --> 01:15:28.457
MUCH BETTER PROCESS IN TERMS OF

01:15:28.523 --> 01:15:30.425
BEING ABLE TO PREDICT AND- BOTH

01:15:30.492 --> 01:15:33.028
AT THE PUBLIC SECTOR- YEAH THE

01:15:33.095 --> 01:15:34.563
PUBLIC AND BUSINESS SECTOR AS

01:15:34.630 --> 01:15:35.564
WELL AS LOCAL HEALTH

01:15:35.631 --> 01:15:37.432
JURISDICTIONS ABILITY. TO

01:15:37.499 --> 01:15:39.201
EXPLAIN WHAT WAS HAPPENING I

01:15:39.268 --> 01:15:40.769
THINK OUR EQUITY PLAYBOOK IN

01:15:40.836 --> 01:15:42.237
OUR EQUITY METRIC IS A TRUE

01:15:42.304 --> 01:15:43.972
SIGN OF SIX UP BETWEEN YOU KNOW

01:15:44.039 --> 01:15:45.674
WHAT PUBLIC HEALTH STAND FOR

01:15:45.741 --> 01:15:47.109
AND HOW WE WANT TO RUN THE

01:15:47.175 --> 01:15:50.212
RESPONSE TO- PROTESTS VIRUS AND

01:15:50.279 --> 01:15:51.680
MAKING SURE THAT WE REALLY DO

01:15:51.747 --> 01:15:53.448
TAKE INTO ACCOUNT. ADEQUATELY

01:15:53.515 --> 01:15:54.650
AND THAT WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING

01:15:54.716 --> 01:15:57.219
WE CAN TO MAKE THAT REAL-

01:15:57.286 --> 01:15:59.554
ACROSS THE STATE I THINK WHAT

01:15:59.621 --> 01:16:01.823
WE MOVED AS WE OPEN SECTORS AND

01:16:01.890 --> 01:16:03.392
REALIZED THAT OUR COMMUNITY

01:16:03.458 --> 01:16:05.794
TRANSMISSION WOUND UP MOVING TO

01:16:05.861 --> 01:16:12.067
THE REGIONAL STAY AT. HOME

01:16:12.134 --> 01:16:14.102
ORDER I'M LAWS FOR REALLY. AND

01:16:14.169 --> 01:16:15.871
US. MAKE SURE THAT. PREVENTIVE

01:16:15.938 --> 01:16:16.471
DENTICLE HEALTH CARE CAPACITY

01:16:16.538 --> 01:16:18.273
FROM BEING OVER ONE- AND THE

01:16:18.340 --> 01:16:19.474
OBJECTIVE TO SET LIMITS IN A-

01:16:19.541 --> 01:16:21.109
WITH. WITH OTHER FROM OUTSIDE

REDUCE. COVE IN NINETEEN

01:16:25.047 --> 01:16:27.649
TRANSIT. BY REDUCING THE STERN

01:16:27.716 --> 01:16:30.385
TRANSMISSION WE'RE ABLE TO I'M

01:16:30.452 --> 01:16:32.120
REALLY REDUCE THAT. BEND THE

01:16:32.187 --> 01:16:34.122
CURVE DOWNWARD SO THAT WE COULD

01:16:34.189 --> 01:16:35.390
REDUCE THE IMPACT ON THE

01:16:35.457 --> 01:16:37.159
HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM. WE

01:16:37.225 --> 01:16:38.927
HAVE OUR MODELERS LOOKING OUT

01:16:38.994 --> 01:16:40.462
THAT AND MAKING SURE

01:16:40.529 --> 01:16:41.930
PREDICTIONS AS TO WHAT IMPACT

01:16:41.997 --> 01:16:43.432
THAT HAD AND COMPARED TO

01:16:43.498 --> 01:16:45.767

WERE AT LEAST. TWENTY FIVE

01:16:50.872 --> 01:16:51.139
THOUSAND FEWER

01:16:51.206 --> 01:16:53.275
HOSPITALIZATIONS- FIVE THOUSAND

01:16:53.342 --> 01:16:55.777
FEWER DEATHS BECAUSE OF THE

01:16:55.844 --> 01:16:56.345
REGIONAL STAY AT HOME ACROSS

01:16:56.411 --> 01:16:58.413
THE STATE. AND AS YOU KNOW THE

01:16:58.480 --> 01:16:59.614
REGIONAL STAND HOME ORDER

01:16:59.681 --> 01:17:00.949

CAPACITY IN REGIONS WITH LESS

01:17:07.889 --> 01:17:13.095
THAN. 15% I SEE YOU PAPER

01:17:13.161 --> 01:17:14.997
AVAILABILITY. WE GAVE NEW GUY.

01:17:15.063 --> 01:17:15.630
OUT THE TO GO ALONG WITH THAT

01:17:15.697 --> 01:17:17.699
REGION STAND HOME ORDER WE THEN

01:17:17.766 --> 01:17:20.302
ALL MOVE TO A PUBLIC ORDER.

01:17:20.369 --> 01:17:20.802
THAT CANCELLED ELECTIVE

REALLY- MAY SURE THAT WE HAD AN

01:17:33.015 --> 01:17:34.683
APPLE ACT DISTRIBUTION OF

01:17:34.750 --> 01:17:36.418
HEALTHCARE RESOURCES ACROSS THE

01:17:36.485 --> 01:17:38.186
STATE AND STATE OUT OF CRISIS

01:17:38.253 --> 01:17:39.855
CARE OR MOVE VERY QUICKLY OUT

01:17:39.921 --> 01:17:42.157
OF CRISIS CARE. THROUGHOUT ALL

01:17:42.224 --> 01:17:44.126
JURISDICTIONS IN THE STATE. I

01:17:44.192 --> 01:17:45.594
THINK WE CONTINUE TO USE OUR

01:17:45.660 --> 01:17:47.596
MODELS AND PROJECTIONS TO TRY

01:17:47.662 --> 01:17:49.431
TO IMPROVE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF

01:17:49.498 --> 01:17:50.699
THE SITUATION AND TO MAKE

01:17:50.766 --> 01:17:52.968
POLICY DECISIONS I THINK YOU

01:17:53.035 --> 01:17:53.935
KNOW IT THEY IT HAS BEEN

01:17:54.002 --> 01:17:55.604
CHALLENGING OF WE ARE ALL ARE

01:17:55.670 --> 01:17:56.738
LEARNING MORE AND MORE EVERY

01:17:56.805 --> 01:17:58.440
DAY ABOUT THE VIRUS AND WHAT.

01:17:58.507 --> 01:18:00.142
WE CAN DO TO COMBAT THAT BUT I

01:18:00.208 --> 01:18:02.244
THINK REALLY THAT SUCCESS HAS

01:18:02.310 --> 01:18:04.513
BEEN THE ONGOING DIALOGUE AND

01:18:04.579 --> 01:18:06.081
THE ABILITY TO CHANGE COURSE

01:18:06.148 --> 01:18:09.351
WELL AS WE LEARN MORE. ABOUT

01:18:09.418 --> 01:18:10.919
THE VIRUS. OBVIOUSLY SOME

01:18:10.986 --> 01:18:12.421
COUNTIES BETTER WORSE THAN

01:18:12.487 --> 01:18:14.056
OTHERS IN TERMS OF RESOURCES

01:18:14.122 --> 01:18:15.891
TOOLS EXPERTISE AND EVEN

01:18:15.957 --> 01:18:18.693
COMMUNITY TRANSMISSION- AND I

01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:20.362
THINK WE HAVE DONE OUR BEST.

01:18:20.429 --> 01:18:21.963
EVEN EVEN IN SPITE OF THE FACT

01:18:22.030 --> 01:18:23.198
THAT THE COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH

01:18:23.265 --> 01:18:25.467
INFRASTRUCTURE HAS DECLINED

01:18:25.534 --> 01:18:27.569
OVER THE PAST DECADE- AND MANY

01:18:27.636 --> 01:18:29.604
ALLERGIES HAVE BROADER OR LOCAL

01:18:29.671 --> 01:18:31.173
JURISDICTIONS HAVE. SEEN

01:18:31.239 --> 01:18:32.641
SUBSTANTIAL REDUCTIONS IN

01:18:32.707 --> 01:18:34.676
STAFF. THEIR DATA SYSTEMS THAT

01:18:34.743 --> 01:18:35.544
HAVE NOT KEPT UP WITH

01:18:35.610 --> 01:18:37.979
TECHNOLOGY. OUR RESOURCES ARE

01:18:38.046 --> 01:18:39.915
NOT. EVENLY DISTRIBUTED ACROSS

01:18:39.981 --> 01:18:42.317
THE STATE SO WE KNOW THAT WE

01:18:42.384 --> 01:18:43.852
HAVE JUMPED IN A BIGGER WAY IN

01:18:43.919 --> 01:18:45.320

EIGHT THOUSAND A DAY. AND

01:27:03.785 --> 01:27:04.819
REALLY DRAMATICALLY INCREASING

REAL ESTATE CONTINUES TO BE-

01:27:08.856 --> 01:27:11.859
GETTING THE VACCINE AND GETTING

01:27:11.926 --> 01:27:12.760
MORE SUPPLY. AS FAR AS

01:27:12.827 --> 01:27:13.728
ACCOUNTING FOR THE RESET AND-

01:27:13.795 --> 01:27:17.098
OF EACH PERSON- SO THEIR RACE

01:27:17.165 --> 01:27:17.999
ETHNICITY DATA IS COLLECTED

01:27:18.066 --> 01:27:21.169
WITH THE VACCINATION RECORD-

01:27:21.235 --> 01:27:23.738
AND TO KIND OF READ THROUGH SO

01:27:23.805 --> 01:27:25.707
FOR AMERICAN INDIAN ALASKAN.

01:27:25.773 --> 01:27:29.110
NATIVE OF THAT PERCENT IS ZERO

01:27:29.177 --> 01:27:33.147
POINT TWO EIGHT PERCENT- TEN

01:27:33.214 --> 01:27:33.781
THOUSAND SEVEN FORTY TO THAT OF

01:27:33.848 --> 01:27:35.183
AN ACCIDENT WITH A AT LEAST ONE

01:27:35.249 --> 01:27:39.854

01:27:39.921 --> 01:27:41.222
OF BAD PEOPLE GOTTEN AT LEAST

01:27:41.289 --> 01:27:44.325
ONE DOSE. THAT ASIAN RACE IN

01:27:44.392 --> 01:27:45.860
THE STATE WOULD HAVE THIRTEEN

01:27:45.927 --> 01:27:48.496
POINT 6% OF THE TOTAL DOSES

01:27:48.563 --> 01:27:50.732
ADMINISTERED- I THINK I'M JUST

01:27:50.798 --> 01:27:52.233
GONNA TALK TO THE PERCENTAGES

01:27:52.300 --> 01:27:54.268
THAT SEEMS- MOST EASY TO RELATE

01:27:54.335 --> 01:27:56.070
TO. BLACK AFRICAN AMERICAN IT'S

01:27:56.137 --> 01:27:58.339
BEEN TWO POINT 7% OF THE TOTAL

01:27:58.406 --> 01:28:00.642
DOSES ADMINISTERED. A LATINO

01:28:00.708 --> 01:28:02.610
FIFTEEN POINT ONE PERCENT.

01:28:02.677 --> 01:28:05.680
MULTIRACIAL FOURTEEN POINT 6%

01:28:05.747 --> 01:28:07.348
ACTUALLY VERY LARGE CATEGORY-

01:28:07.415 --> 01:28:08.883
THAT I'M NOT SURE WHERE WE'RE

01:28:08.950 --> 01:28:10.251
STARTING TO TAKE A DEEPER DIVE

01:28:10.318 --> 01:28:11.419
BUT WE'RE NOT SURE IF WE'LL BE

01:28:11.486 --> 01:28:12.854
ABLE TO TEASE THAT OUT BUT IT

01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:14.455
IS AGAIN A LARGE CATEGORY. A

01:28:14.522 --> 01:28:15.790
NATIVE ONE OR OTHER PACIFIC

01:28:15.857 --> 01:28:17.825
ISLANDERS ZERO POINT 5% AND

01:28:17.892 --> 01:28:19.627
THEN OTHER TWELVE POINT THREE

ENDS JUNE THIRTIETH. AND

01:55:00.526 --> 01:55:02.095
IMPORTANT THING TO NOTE THREE

01:55:02.161 --> 01:55:05.231

FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTIES INTO

01:55:12.572 --> 01:55:14.641
THE TRIO ACCOUNT BUT IT DOES

01:55:14.707 --> 01:55:16.676
NOT REQUIRE THE ADMINISTRATION

FOR REMEDIATING- THE STRUCTURAL

ISSUES IDENTIFIED- WE SUGGEST

02:05:36.762 --> 02:05:38.063
THAT THELEGISLATURE COULD USE

02:07:34.413 --> 02:07:35.314
LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT

02:07:35.381 --> 02:07:37.416
ALLOCATION WE DON'T SEE THE

ALLOCATIONS YEAH GO TO THE

COUNTY ENTITIES. THERE ARE

02:07:44.256 --> 02:07:45.958
THREE SO AND THIS IS CORRELATED

02:07:46.025 --> 02:07:47.292
I'M TRYING TO COOPERATE OF

02:07:47.359 --> 02:07:48.394
COURSE WHAT WHAT YOUR

02:07:48.460 --> 02:07:50.295
EXPERIENCES WITH WHAT HAPPENS

02:07:50.362 --> 02:07:51.697
IN KERN COUNTY SO THERE ARE

02:07:51.764 --> 02:07:53.866
THREE BUCKETS OF VACCINES THAT

02:07:53.932 --> 02:07:55.634

02:07:55.701 --> 02:07:56.368
TO KERN COUNTY AND OTHER

02:07:56.435 --> 02:07:57.836
COUNTIES. AND SO YOU DON'T HAVE

02:07:57.903 --> 02:08:01.573
A WAY TO ANALYZE. ALL OF IT

02:08:01.640 --> 02:08:04.676
TOGETHER. THAT'S CORRECT. AND I

02:08:04.743 --> 02:08:06.512
KNOW THAT THE PUBLIC HEALTH

02:08:06.578 --> 02:08:08.480
CALIFORNIA PUBLIC OUT THEY JUST

02:08:08.547 --> 02:08:10.749
RELEASED THEIR DASHBOARD IN

02:08:10.816 --> 02:08:13.018
TERMS OF VACCINES. VACCINES

02:08:13.085 --> 02:08:14.887
BEING ADMINISTERED IS THERE A

02:08:14.953 --> 02:08:17.122
WAY FOR YOU TO VERIFY THAT THE

02:08:17.189 --> 02:08:18.791
DATA THAT'S ON THAT DASHBOARD

02:08:18.857 --> 02:08:20.092
TO THE PUBLIC AND WHAT YOU

YOUR CLINICS AND- AND

02:08:24.396 --> 02:08:27.266
INDIVIDUALS IN YOUR COUNTY. IN

02:08:27.332 --> 02:08:28.467
THIS LAST WEEK WE HAVE HAD

02:08:28.534 --> 02:08:30.035
CONVERSATIONS WITH CALIFORNIA

02:08:30.102 --> 02:08:31.503
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH.

02:08:31.570 --> 02:08:34.206
AND WHICH THEY HAVE SENT TO US

02:08:34.273 --> 02:08:37.443
THE DATA THAT THEY HAVE- FOR-

02:08:37.509 --> 02:08:38.477
ALL OF THE ENTITIES THAT ARE

02:08:38.544 --> 02:08:40.746
PROVIDERS THAT LOCAL HEALTH

02:08:40.813 --> 02:08:42.614
DEPARTMENTS ALLOCATE TO. US SO

02:08:42.681 --> 02:08:44.416
NOT THE PHARMACY PARTNERSHIP

02:08:44.483 --> 02:08:46.051
AND NOT THE MULTI COUNTY

02:08:46.118 --> 02:08:49.021
ENTITIES BUT WE ALLOCATED OUT

02:08:49.088 --> 02:08:51.123
TO OTHER LIKE FQHCS AND

02:08:51.190 --> 02:08:53.225
HOSPITAL AND RURAL HEALTH

02:08:53.292 --> 02:08:55.461
CLINICS LET'S SAY. AND SO THEY

02:08:55.527 --> 02:08:56.995
PROVIDED US WHAT THEY HAVE IN

02:08:57.062 --> 02:08:58.464
TERMS OF DATA AND WORK IN THE

02:08:58.530 --> 02:08:59.731
MIDDLE OF A RECONCILIATION

02:08:59.798 --> 02:09:01.600
PROCESS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

02:09:01.667 --> 02:09:03.702
DATA THAT THEY SEE. IS WHAT'S

02:09:03.769 --> 02:09:07.473
pISSUES AND THINGS THAT ARE

02:09:07.539 --> 02:09:09.241
BEING RESOLVED CURRENTLY. OCCUR

02:09:09.308 --> 02:09:10.909
SO I GUESS HE ANSWERED MY

02:09:10.976 --> 02:09:12.611
FOLLOW UP QUESTION WHICH IS THE

02:09:12.678 --> 02:09:14.746
DATA DOESN'T. TECHNICALLY

02:09:14.813 --> 02:09:16.615
CORLEY AT THE MOMENT. WHERE YOU

02:09:16.682 --> 02:09:17.883
HAVE THE NUMBERS YOU HAVE ARE

02:09:17.950 --> 02:09:19.952
NOT EXACTLY THE NUMBERS ON THE

02:09:20.018 --> 02:09:22.121
DASHBOARD THEY DON'T MATCH UP.

02:09:22.187 --> 02:09:24.022
CORRECT WE'RE RECONCILING THAT

02:09:24.089 --> 02:09:25.891
RIGHT NOW WITH THE STATE. OKAY

02:09:25.958 --> 02:09:30.062
AND- SO I GUESS MAYBE IS A BIG

02:09:30.129 --> 02:09:31.296
FOR THE FOUR OR FOUR C. PH N.

02:09:31.363 --> 02:09:33.832
AND ANYONE ANSWER THIS QUESTION

02:09:33.899 --> 02:09:35.134
I GUESS IS. IT IS MY

02:09:35.200 --> 02:09:36.568
UNDERSTANDING AND I HAD A

02:09:36.635 --> 02:09:37.836
CONVERSATION WITH THE CHAIR

02:09:37.903 --> 02:09:39.371
TODAY THAT WHEN SOMEONE GETS

02:09:39.438 --> 02:09:41.073
VACCINATED THAT INFORMATION HAS

02:09:41.140 --> 02:09:42.908
TO BE UPLOADED. INTO THE

02:09:42.975 --> 02:09:45.344
COMPACT SYSTEM. WITHIN TWENTY

02:09:45.410 --> 02:09:48.914
FOUR HOURS IS THAT CORRECT.

02:09:48.981 --> 02:09:49.982
THAT IS WHAT'S SUPPOSED TO

02:09:50.048 --> 02:09:52.251
HAPPEN YES. AND LOCAL HEALTH

02:09:52.317 --> 02:09:54.153
DEPARTMENTS ARE COMPLIANT WITH

02:09:54.219 --> 02:09:56.455
THAT THERE ARE SOME PROVIDERS.

02:09:56.522 --> 02:09:57.089
THAT ARE STRUGGLING WITH THAT

02:09:57.156 --> 02:09:59.091
REQUIREMENT. AND THAT IS ONE OF

02:09:59.158 --> 02:10:00.058
THE CONCERNS OF LOCAL HEALTH

02:10:00.125 --> 02:10:01.493
DEPARTMENTS IS SOME OF THE

02:10:01.560 --> 02:10:02.961
PROVIDERS THAT REACH OUT TO

02:10:03.028 --> 02:10:04.363
VERY SPECIFIC VULNERABLE

02:10:04.429 --> 02:10:06.765
POPULATIONS. HOUSING CHALLENGES

02:10:06.832 --> 02:10:08.333
WITH REGARDS TO THE DATA SIDE

02:10:08.400 --> 02:10:10.669
OF THINGS AND SO IT IT EQUITY

02:10:10.736 --> 02:10:13.939
AND EFFICIENCY MAY NOT. REALLY

02:10:14.006 --> 02:10:15.307
OVERLAP VERY WELL IN THIS

02:10:15.374 --> 02:10:16.842
PARTICULAR INSTANCE IF WE'RE

02:10:16.909 --> 02:10:18.677
GOING STRICTLY FOR LOTS AND

02:10:18.744 --> 02:10:20.112
LOTS OF VACCINE OUT THE DOOR

02:10:20.179 --> 02:10:21.947
AND GREAT DATA TRANSPARENCY.

02:10:22.014 --> 02:10:24.283
THAT'S IDEAL BUT I THINK THERE

02:10:24.349 --> 02:10:25.284
NEEDS TO BE TRAINING AN

02:10:25.350 --> 02:10:27.219
ONBOARDING WITH PROVIDERS THAT

02:10:27.286 --> 02:10:28.453
SPECIFICALLY REACH OUT TO

02:10:28.520 --> 02:10:29.988
VULNERABLE POPULATIONS SO THAT

02:10:30.055 --> 02:10:30.989
THEY'RE ABLE TO MEET THOSE

02:10:31.056 --> 02:10:32.391
REQUIREMENTS WELL. FOR WHAT

02:10:32.457 --> 02:10:34.059
WOULD BE THAT WHAT WOULD BE THE

02:10:34.126 --> 02:10:35.427
SOLUTION THERE I MEAN IF

02:10:35.494 --> 02:10:38.263
BECAUSE OF COURSE. I MEAN MY

02:10:38.330 --> 02:10:39.631
PARENTS GOT THEIR FIRST DOSE

02:10:39.698 --> 02:10:40.699
AND SO I WOULD IF THEY LOSE

02:10:40.766 --> 02:10:42.467
THEIR CARD I WOULD WANT THEM TO

02:10:42.534 --> 02:10:44.136
MAKE SURE THAT THE DATA. IS

02:10:44.203 --> 02:10:46.471
CORRECT WHEN THEY GO BACK TO

02:10:46.538 --> 02:10:48.974
MAKE SURE THEY GET THE RIGHT

02:10:49.041 --> 02:10:49.841
BACKS IN THE SECOND TIME SO.

02:10:49.908 --> 02:10:51.310
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT QUESTION

02:10:51.376 --> 02:10:52.611
IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE THAT

02:10:52.678 --> 02:10:54.179
THE DATA IS ACCURATE. AND PUT

02:10:54.246 --> 02:10:56.315
IN ON A TIMELY BASIS SO THAT

02:10:56.381 --> 02:10:57.916
YOU CAN SEE THINGS IN REAL

02:10:57.983 --> 02:10:59.484
TIME. WE CAN SEE THINGS IN REAL

02:10:59.551 --> 02:11:01.186
TIME AND CDPH CAN SEE THINGS IN

02:11:01.253 --> 02:11:04.156
REAL TIME. SO WHAT WOULD BE A

02:11:04.223 --> 02:11:06.992
POSSIBLE SOLUTION. WELL I THINK

02:11:07.059 --> 02:11:08.694
IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT AS

02:11:08.760 --> 02:11:10.195
LONG AS IT INDIVIDUAL IS

02:11:10.262 --> 02:11:12.164
RETURNING TO THE SAME PROVIDER.

02:11:12.231 --> 02:11:13.532
THAT PROVIDER WILL HAVE THE

02:11:13.599 --> 02:11:15.067
INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR FIRST

02:11:15.133 --> 02:11:16.969
DOSE FOR SECOND DOSES. SO THIS

02:11:17.035 --> 02:11:19.404
IS REALLY ABOUT DATA ACCURACY

02:11:19.471 --> 02:11:20.939
AND TRANSPARENCY IN THE STATE

02:11:21.006 --> 02:11:23.976
SYSTEM. AND WE AGREE IT IT

02:11:24.042 --> 02:11:25.711
NEEDS TO BE ACCURATE AND NEEDS

02:11:25.777 --> 02:11:28.046
TO BE TIMELY. WHAT WE RECOMMEND

02:11:28.113 --> 02:11:29.848
IS. REALLY WORKING WITH THE

02:11:29.915 --> 02:11:31.350
LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS TO

02:11:31.416 --> 02:11:33.318
IDENTIFY THOSE PROVIDERS THAT

02:11:33.385 --> 02:11:34.786
ARE IMPORTANT FOR PROVIDING

02:11:34.853 --> 02:11:36.922
VACCINE EQUITY. WHAT WHAT ALSO

02:11:36.989 --> 02:11:38.624
NEED SUPPORT WITH REGARDS TO

02:11:38.690 --> 02:11:40.892
THE DATA ENTRY. AND ACCURACY ON

02:11:40.959 --> 02:11:42.527
THAT SIDE AND THAT MIGHT TAKE

02:11:42.594 --> 02:11:44.997
SOME TIME. WE DON'T WANT TO

02:11:45.063 --> 02:11:46.665
LOSE THOSE. IMPORTANT COMMUNITY

02:11:46.732 --> 02:11:47.766
BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE

02:11:47.833 --> 02:11:50.435
PROVIDING VACCINE ON THE

02:11:50.502 --> 02:11:52.938
GROUND. TWO GLOBAL POPULATIONS.

02:11:53.005 --> 02:11:54.473
BUT NEED TO ONBOARD THEM

02:11:54.539 --> 02:11:56.341
APPROPRIATELY. HOW KERN. AND

02:11:56.408 --> 02:11:58.610
THEN I GO TO CVS AS A SINCE I

02:11:58.677 --> 02:12:01.113
HAVE. THIS IS A I HAVE YOU IN

02:12:01.179 --> 02:12:02.347
TERMS OF YOU YOU MAY A STATE.

02:12:02.414 --> 02:12:05.751
THAT HE WOULD- PREFERRED SHARE

02:12:05.817 --> 02:12:10.122
DECISION MAKING- COULD YOU GIVE

02:12:10.188 --> 02:12:11.823
AN EXAMPLE OF WHEN A WHERE THEY

02:12:11.890 --> 02:12:13.792
WAS A CHAIRED MAKING A ONE THAT

02:12:13.859 --> 02:12:19.531
COULD HAVE IMPROVE- I DON'T PUT

02:12:19.598 --> 02:12:21.500
ON THE SPOT I'M JUST TRYING TO

02:12:21.566 --> 02:12:23.035
INTERNET WE JUST WANTED TO IT

02:12:23.101 --> 02:12:24.169
MAY I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:12:24.236 --> 02:12:25.904
THAT- I'M PRESENTING IT

02:12:25.971 --> 02:12:31.743
ACCURATELY. I THINK ONE EXAMPLE

02:12:31.810 --> 02:12:34.746

02:12:34.813 --> 02:12:36.948
THE THAT HAS BEEN MIXED. UP

02:12:37.015 --> 02:12:38.750
THERE DETERMINATION TO HAVE A

02:12:38.817 --> 02:12:39.718
THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR WAS A

02:12:39.785 --> 02:12:41.687
DECISION THAT WAS MADE. AND

REGARDS TO THAT AND WE HAVE

02:12:49.461 --> 02:12:51.063
BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH THEM

02:12:51.129 --> 02:12:52.631
TO WORK THROUGH THAT ISSUE-

02:12:52.698 --> 02:12:54.800
THAT'S ONE EXAMPLE OF. A

02:12:54.866 --> 02:12:57.669
DECISION FULLY COMPLY DONE.

02:12:57.736 --> 02:13:00.672
WITHOUT OUR INPUT PRIOR TO

02:13:00.739 --> 02:13:04.776
DECISION BEING MADE. I

02:13:04.843 --> 02:13:08.447
APPRECIATE IF THIS IS. IF

FIRST OFF ON THE OF THE WINDOWS

02:13:43.849 --> 02:13:45.016

02:13:45.083 --> 02:13:46.485
WHAT. SITUATION AND WHICH WE

02:13:46.551 --> 02:13:47.719

02:20:36.995 --> 02:20:37.862
OF WORK RIGHT NOW WITH OUR

02:20:37.929 --> 02:20:39.297
LOCAL PARTNERS AND WITH THE

02:20:39.364 --> 02:20:40.865
DATA TEAM AT THE STATE. TO

02:20:40.932 --> 02:20:42.700
REALLY MAPPED OUT ALL OF THE

02:20:42.767 --> 02:20:44.202
ORGANIZATIONAL CODE SO THAT WE

02:20:44.269 --> 02:20:45.303
HAVE A BETTER PICTURE AND

02:20:45.370 --> 02:20:47.038
HOPING TO HAVE THAT VERY SOON.

02:20:47.105 --> 02:20:48.239
OKAY I THINK THAT I THINK THE

02:20:48.306 --> 02:20:49.808
COMMITTEE WOULD WOULD LIKE THAT

02:20:49.874 --> 02:20:50.975
TO SEE THAT INFORMATION AS WELL

02:20:51.042 --> 02:20:52.377
SO IF THAT COULD DIFFERENCE

02:20:52.443 --> 02:20:53.678
PROVIDED- AND I HAVE TWO MORE

02:20:53.745 --> 02:20:57.849
QUESTIONS. MISTER JACK- IN

02:20:57.916 --> 02:20:59.551
TERMS OF. SO FORGET MY SOME. BY

02:20:59.617 --> 02:21:01.820
SAID. IN TERMS OF THAT. THE

02:21:01.886 --> 02:21:02.720
AMOUNT OF DOES IS BEING

02:21:02.787 --> 02:21:06.024
ADMINISTERED. IF THE DATA

02:21:06.090 --> 02:21:07.625
EVENTUALLY ANY WITHIN TWENTY

02:21:07.692 --> 02:21:08.893
FOUR HOURS A PLUS OR MINUS A

02:21:08.960 --> 02:21:10.261
DAY OR TWO IF ALL OF THE

02:21:10.328 --> 02:21:11.696
INFORMATION IS UPLOADED INTO

02:21:11.763 --> 02:21:14.399
THE COMPACT SYSTEM WHY COULDN'T

02:21:14.465 --> 02:21:15.266
I WOULDN'T WHY COULDN'T YOU

02:21:15.333 --> 02:21:17.535
JUST PULL THE COUNTY DATA THE

02:21:17.602 --> 02:21:18.136
NUMBER OF VACCINES BEING

02:21:18.203 --> 02:21:20.371
ADMINISTERED IN EACH COUNTY AND

02:21:20.438 --> 02:21:21.606
GIVE IT TO THE COUNTIES FOR

02:21:21.673 --> 02:21:24.609
THEM. TO VERIFY OR THAT OR THE

02:21:24.676 --> 02:21:26.177
ARE THERE MULTIPLE INPUTS INTO

02:21:26.244 --> 02:21:27.779
THE COMPACT SYSTEM THAT

02:21:27.846 --> 02:21:29.013
PREVENTS THAT FROM HAPPENING IS

02:21:29.080 --> 02:21:32.183
A COMPLEX SYSTEM THAT IS A

02:21:32.250 --> 02:21:32.684
MYERS ANY HAS TO BE 100%

02:21:32.750 --> 02:21:34.419
ACCURATE. YEAH THERE ARE

02:21:34.485 --> 02:21:36.154
MULTIPLE DATA SYSTEM ABOUT PULL

02:21:36.221 --> 02:21:38.089
DIFFERENT PIECES OF DATA ABOUT

02:21:38.156 --> 02:21:39.324
HAVE TO BE BROUGHT TOGETHER SO

02:21:39.390 --> 02:21:40.792
THERE'S THAT CARE DATA WHICH

02:21:40.859 --> 02:21:42.760
SHOWED BE ADMINISTERED. DOSE

02:21:42.827 --> 02:21:44.128
SAYS THERE'S ANOTHER SYSTEM

02:21:44.195 --> 02:21:46.164
THAT SHOWS THE SHIP DOES MOVE

02:21:46.231 --> 02:21:48.566
BEARS. ON ANOTHER. SYSTEM THAT

02:21:48.633 --> 02:21:50.368
SHOWS THE INVENTORY OF WALK ON

02:21:50.435 --> 02:21:53.137
HAND AND EACH PROVIDERS PM VERY

02:21:53.204 --> 02:21:54.739
TO LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS.

02:21:54.806 --> 02:21:56.274
AND BECAUSE OUR PHONES ARE A

02:21:56.341 --> 02:21:57.775
MULTITUDE OF SYSTEMS THAT

02:21:57.842 --> 02:21:58.977
INFORMATION HAS TO BE BROUGHT

02:21:59.043 --> 02:22:01.012
TOGETHER- AND WE ARE SHARING

02:22:01.079 --> 02:22:02.547
THAT WITH THE COUNTIES NOW AND

02:22:02.614 --> 02:22:05.750
THAT IS. WHAT WE'RE I'M USING

02:22:05.817 --> 02:22:07.151
TO REALLY CLEAN UP THAT DATA

02:22:07.218 --> 02:22:08.353
AND I THINK OVER THE LAST

02:22:08.419 --> 02:22:09.687
COUPLE OF DAYS. WE'VE GOTTEN

02:22:09.754 --> 02:22:11.689
PRETTY FAR IN TERMS OF THE ORG

02:22:11.756 --> 02:22:13.758
CODES MATCHING AND REALLY.

02:22:13.825 --> 02:22:14.926
UNDERSTANDING HOW WE GOT TO

02:22:14.993 --> 02:22:16.461
CLEAN THAT UP SO THAT WE CAN

02:22:16.527 --> 02:22:21.032
INDEED PROVIDE. JUST WHAT

02:22:21.099 --> 02:22:22.000
PEOPLE ARE ASKING FOR. AND HOW

02:22:22.066 --> 02:22:22.800
LONG DOES IT TAKE TO CLEAN

02:22:22.867 --> 02:22:24.936
CLEAN UP THE- IT TAKEN OUT

02:22:25.003 --> 02:22:26.804
WHILE I'M IN ITS FIRST IN

02:22:26.871 --> 02:22:28.339
BRINGING ALL THAT DATA FROM THE

02:22:28.406 --> 02:22:29.774
DIFFERENT SYSTEMS INTO ONE

02:22:29.841 --> 02:22:32.243
PLACE WHICH WE'VE NOW DONE- AND

02:22:32.310 --> 02:22:34.112
THEN IT REALLY IS A PROCESS OF

02:22:34.178 --> 02:22:36.147
THOUSANDS OF CODES IN MULTIPLE

02:22:36.214 --> 02:22:37.448
SYSTEMS AND BRINGING THEM

02:22:37.515 --> 02:22:39.117
TOGETHER SO. YOU KNOW WE WISH

02:22:39.183 --> 02:22:41.886
IT COULD BE FASTER BUT WE THINK

02:22:41.953 --> 02:22:43.821
WE ARE ALMOST THERE. AND I

02:22:43.888 --> 02:22:45.323
THINK YOU'RE GONNA SEE DOES

02:22:45.390 --> 02:22:47.926
THIS EXIST FOR OTHER. DISEASES

02:22:47.992 --> 02:22:49.327
AND DATA THAT'S COLLECTED FROM

02:22:49.394 --> 02:22:50.828
OTHER DISEASES AND OTHER

02:22:50.895 --> 02:22:54.832
VACCINES. I DON'T THINK THAT

02:22:54.899 --> 02:22:56.367
THE MAGNITUDE OF THEIR FOR

02:22:56.434 --> 02:22:57.902
OTHER VACCINES OF THE CARE

02:22:57.969 --> 02:22:59.637
SYSTEM REALLY DOES WORK FOR

02:22:59.704 --> 02:23:02.240
CHILDHOOD VACCINES AND YOU KNOW

02:23:02.307 --> 02:23:03.975
I THINK THAT THAT HAS NOT BEEN

02:23:04.042 --> 02:23:07.045
AN ISSUE. I THINK WE HAVE. SOME

02:23:07.111 --> 02:23:09.047
FOLKS HAVE SAID IN THIS HEARING

02:23:09.113 --> 02:23:10.148
YEAH THE SYSTEMS WEREN'T

02:23:10.214 --> 02:23:11.282
DESIGNED TO DO WHAT WE'RE

02:23:11.349 --> 02:23:12.417
ASKING THEM TO DO IN THIS

02:23:12.483 --> 02:23:14.385
PANDEMIC AND I THINK WE'RE ALL

02:23:14.452 --> 02:23:15.987
LEARNING. ABOUT HOW TO CREATE

02:23:16.054 --> 02:23:17.855
SYSTEMS WITH NEW TECHNOLOGY

02:23:17.922 --> 02:23:19.557
THAT COULD BRING UP INTO THE

02:23:19.624 --> 02:23:21.592
FUTURE OKAY AND THEN JUST. SO

02:23:21.659 --> 02:23:24.128
THAT WHEN THE LA DODGERS

02:23:24.195 --> 02:23:26.531
STADIUM AND PACO PARK AND CAL

02:23:26.597 --> 02:23:27.932
EXPO FAIRGROUNDS WHEN THOSE

02:23:27.999 --> 02:23:29.968
SITES ARE LAUNCHED- OR BEING

02:23:30.034 --> 02:23:31.169
ARE I DOUBT THAT A LARGE ARE

02:23:31.235 --> 02:23:32.537
THEY PART OF THE COUNTY ALLEN.

02:23:32.603 --> 02:23:34.305
ALLOTMENT OR THEY SEPARATE ON

02:23:34.372 --> 02:23:38.409
TOP OF WHAT THE COUNTY GETS BI

02:23:38.476 --> 02:23:41.012
WEEKLY. I THINK IT UPON US. IS

02:23:41.079 --> 02:23:42.547
SO OF THE FEDERAL SITES BETTER

02:23:42.613 --> 02:23:44.515
COMING IN THROUGH FEMA WILL

02:23:44.582 --> 02:23:46.651
BRING THEIR OWN DOSES- AND-

02:23:46.718 --> 02:23:48.553
THAT ARE ON TOP OF WHAT THE

02:23:48.619 --> 02:23:50.088
COUNTIES ARE GETTING. IN OTHER

02:23:50.154 --> 02:23:52.857
CASES WE HAVE- RELIED ON A

02:23:52.924 --> 02:23:54.459
PARTNERSHIP WITH THE COUNTY AND

02:23:54.525 --> 02:23:55.126
USING SOME OF THE COUNTY

02:23:55.193 --> 02:23:57.195
ALLOCATIONS. AND SOMETIMES THEY

02:23:57.261 --> 02:23:59.197
ARE WITH PROVIDERS OR ENTITIES

02:23:59.263 --> 02:24:00.331
THAT ARE RUNNING SOME OF THOSE

02:24:00.398 --> 02:24:01.966
SITES AND RELYING ON THE-

02:24:02.033 --> 02:24:03.634
ALLEGATIONS THAT THEY RECEIVED

02:24:03.701 --> 02:24:06.571
SO IT REALLY IS A MAX. OKAY AND

02:24:06.637 --> 02:24:07.739
MY LAST QUESTION IS AND I HOPE

02:24:07.805 --> 02:24:10.908
YOU CAN JUST PROVIDE SOME BIG

02:24:10.975 --> 02:24:12.643
JUST CLARITY ON THIS. ARE WE

02:24:12.710 --> 02:24:14.012
AND ONE B. I WE'VE ACTION

02:24:14.078 --> 02:24:16.047
ADDING ONE BE IN CALIFORNIA AT

02:24:16.114 --> 02:24:18.783
THE WEBSITE. A CITY BASED

02:24:18.850 --> 02:24:20.318
WEBSITE SAYS THAT WE ARE IN ONE

02:24:20.385 --> 02:24:22.587
B. AND THEN BUT IF YOU LOOK AT

02:24:22.653 --> 02:24:24.422
THE CDPH GUIDANCE IT SAYS THE

02:24:24.489 --> 02:24:27.392
PRIORITIZE ONE A. AND SIXTY

02:24:27.458 --> 02:24:28.593
FIVE AND UP FIRST AND SAID

02:24:28.659 --> 02:24:30.928
THAT. MY COUNTY AND I WON'T

02:24:30.995 --> 02:24:32.063
SPEAK FOR OTHER COUNTIES.

02:24:32.130 --> 02:24:33.331
THERE'S A LOT OF THERE'S SOME

02:24:33.398 --> 02:24:35.033
BUT THERE'S SOME CONFUSION.

02:24:35.099 --> 02:24:37.268
BECAUSE THOSE AND ONE BE WANT

02:24:37.335 --> 02:24:39.303
TO GO AND GET VACCINATED. SO IS

02:24:39.370 --> 02:24:40.304
IT ARE WE CAN CURRENTLY

02:24:40.371 --> 02:24:42.640
VACCINATING ONE B. NOW OR IS IT

02:24:42.707 --> 02:24:44.409
A WE PRIORITIZE IN ONE DAY AND

02:24:44.475 --> 02:24:47.345
SIXTY FIVE IN A- AND THEN WAIT

02:24:47.412 --> 02:24:48.913
AND WAITING FOR. ONE BEAD

02:24:48.980 --> 02:24:52.483
BUYING SUPPLIES. ONE B. IS

02:24:52.550 --> 02:24:54.085
ELIGIBLE TO BE VACCINATED RIGHT

02:24:54.152 --> 02:24:56.621
NOW- WE'RE STANDING KNEELING TO

02:24:56.687 --> 02:24:59.457
FINISH BLOCKS AND ENDING ON A-

02:24:59.524 --> 02:25:01.225
AND COUNTIES ARE IN SOMEWHAT

02:25:01.292 --> 02:25:02.827
DIFFERENT PLACES IN TERMS OF

02:25:02.894 --> 02:25:04.462
HOW FAR THEY'VE GOTTEN INTO THE

02:25:04.529 --> 02:25:06.731
ONE BE ON MAXIMIZATION

02:25:06.798 --> 02:25:09.333
SEPTEMBER FOCUSING ON YEAH BUT

02:25:09.400 --> 02:25:10.902
IT'S NOT THAT ARE NOT ELIGIBLE

02:25:10.968 --> 02:25:13.671
SO SIXTY FIVE AN OPT AND THE

02:25:13.738 --> 02:25:15.173
THREE SECTORS ARE ELIGIBLE AT

02:25:15.239 --> 02:25:17.341
THE SAME TIME. BUT BECAUSE OF

02:25:17.408 --> 02:25:19.143
THE SHORTAGE OF VACCINES YOU

02:25:19.210 --> 02:25:20.411
CAN'T DO EVERYBODY OUT LONG

02:25:20.478 --> 02:25:23.548
TERM SO THEY ARE- PRIORITIZING-

02:25:23.614 --> 02:25:25.216
SOMETIMES THE SEVENTY FIVE YEAR

02:25:25.283 --> 02:25:27.251
AND OLDER AND THEN MOVING TO

02:25:27.318 --> 02:25:28.753
THE SIXTY FIVE AND MOVING

02:25:28.820 --> 02:25:30.755
ACROSS THE SECTOR SO I THINK

02:25:30.822 --> 02:25:32.690
THAT THEY'RE ALL ELIGIBLE THE

02:25:32.757 --> 02:25:33.991
QUESTION IS GIVEN THE LIMITED

02:25:34.058 --> 02:25:35.993
VACCINE HOW MUCH CAN THEY- YEAH

02:25:36.060 --> 02:25:39.263
REALLY- HANDLE IN TERMS OF.

02:25:39.330 --> 02:25:41.499
REALLY HAVING THE SITE DELIVER

02:25:41.566 --> 02:25:46.404
THE. VACCINE TO THE APPROPRIATE

02:25:46.471 --> 02:25:48.306
GROUPS.SO BOTH ARE CORRECT SO

02:25:48.372 --> 02:25:49.974
THE COUNTIES ARE DOING THEY CAN

02:25:50.041 --> 02:25:51.109
CURRENTLY THEY'RE RIGHT AND

02:25:51.175 --> 02:25:52.610
THEY CAN IS THERE PRIVATIZING

02:25:52.677 --> 02:25:56.180
AND WAITING ALL RIGHT. WHY I

02:25:56.247 --> 02:25:57.882
THINK WE'RE WHAT I'M SAYING IS

02:25:57.949 --> 02:25:59.817
EVERYBODY IS L. A. AND ONE B.

02:25:59.884 --> 02:26:02.520
TIER ONE THAT INCLUDES THE

02:26:02.587 --> 02:26:03.588
SIXTY FIVE YEARS AND OLDER AS

02:26:03.654 --> 02:26:05.556
WELL AS THE THREE SECTORS. AND

02:26:05.623 --> 02:26:07.525
SO HOW THE COUNTIES ARE SUB

02:26:07.592 --> 02:26:09.460
PRIORITIZING TO ADDRESS THAT

02:26:09.527 --> 02:26:10.862
GIVEN THE NUMBERS THAT THEY

02:26:10.928 --> 02:26:12.029
HAVE IN EACH OF THOSE

02:26:12.096 --> 02:26:14.565
POPULATIONS MAY VARY A LITTLE

02:26:14.632 --> 02:26:16.667
BIT. AND SO THE TIMING MAY VARY

02:26:16.734 --> 02:26:19.604
BUT THE GROUP IS STILL ELIGIBLE

02:26:19.670 --> 02:26:23.207
ACROSS THE STATE. OKAY I

02:26:23.274 --> 02:26:23.708
CERTAINLY APPRECIATE YOU

02:26:23.774 --> 02:26:24.342
ANSWERING THOSE QUESTIONS THANK

I. D. D. POPULATION. IN THE

02:26:52.537 --> 02:26:55.606

IN THE GENERAL POPULATION BUT

02:27:03.881 --> 02:27:05.516
TWO TO THREE TIMES MORE LIKELY

02:27:05.583 --> 02:27:08.386
TO DIE IF THEY ARE INFECTED-

02:27:08.452 --> 02:27:10.254
WITH THIS POPULATION IT'S HARD

02:27:10.321 --> 02:27:12.056
TO COMMUNICATE A LOT OF THE

02:27:12.123 --> 02:27:13.791

VULNERABLE POPULATIONS I'M FROM

VACCINATION IS GOING TO BE

02:51:34.417 --> 02:51:37.153
SLOWER. SO WHAT WE ULTIMATELY

02:51:37.220 --> 02:51:38.021
WANT TO SEE IS THAT THIRD PARTY

02:51:38.087 --> 02:51:40.056

02:52:20.730 --> 02:52:21.798
THAT DOESN'T HAVE A LOT OF DATA

02:52:21.864 --> 02:52:23.900
EXPERTISE SO ADEQUATE TRAINING

02:52:23.966 --> 02:52:25.902

THE SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE. A YOUR

02:53:19.655 --> 02:53:22.158
TO TALK TO HIM RIGHT NOW. WHAT

02:53:22.225 --> 02:53:27.130
WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE. IT WOULD

02:53:27.196 --> 02:53:29.532
INCLUDE THOSE PROVIDERS THAT

ARE NEEDED TO TRULY OUTRAGE TO

02:53:31.901 --> 02:53:33.770
THE ENTIRE POPULATION WITHIN AN

02:53:33.836 --> 02:53:35.671
EIGHT COUNTY AREA. IT WOULD

02:53:35.738 --> 02:53:37.907
ALSO INCLUDE A DATA SYSTEM

02:53:37.974 --> 02:53:39.509
THAT'S EASILY ACCESSIBLE AND

02:53:39.575 --> 02:53:41.611
ACCESSIBLE REMOTELY SO PROBABLY

02:53:41.677 --> 02:53:45.214
CLOUD BASED. THE ABILITY TO

02:53:45.281 --> 02:53:47.150
INPUT DATA REAL TIME THE

02:53:47.216 --> 02:53:49.085
ABILITY TO CALL REPORTS REAL

TO OUR LOCAL CAN- COMMUNITIES

02:53:57.293 --> 02:53:58.928
AND THE MEDIA ARE BECAUSE WHERE

02:53:58.995 --> 02:54:01.831
ELSE A LOT OF QUESTIONS THAT

02:54:01.898 --> 02:54:02.431
THAT WE JUST CAN'T. ANSWER AT

02:54:02.498 --> 02:54:04.600
THIS POINT. AND WITH THE

02:54:04.667 --> 02:54:06.502
FLEXIBILITY OF THOSE SYSTEMS

02:54:06.569 --> 02:54:08.404
I'M TO BE ABLE TO PLAN AND

02:54:08.471 --> 02:54:11.440
MINISTER PODS ON THE GROUND.

02:54:11.507 --> 02:54:13.442
OUR COUNTIES ARE SO DIVERSE.

02:54:13.509 --> 02:54:15.945
AND BEING ABLE TO SCHEDULE

02:54:16.012 --> 02:54:18.347
CLINICS THE WAY WE NEED TO.

02:54:18.414 --> 02:54:20.383
HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO HAVE A

02:54:20.449 --> 02:54:23.319
SYSTEM WHERE WE'RE USING THE

02:54:23.386 --> 02:54:26.255
SAME INPUT SYSTEM. BUT WE MAY

02:54:26.322 --> 02:54:27.957
BE ABLE TO LIMIT ACCESS TO THIS

02:54:28.024 --> 02:54:29.659
GROUP VERSUS BACK GROUP TO BE

02:54:29.725 --> 02:54:31.360
ABLE TO ALLOW SLOTS FOR THE

02:54:31.427 --> 02:54:32.895
VULNERABLE POPULATION. FOR

02:54:32.962 --> 02:54:35.398
EXAMPLE. WE HAD BEEN

02:54:35.464 --> 02:54:37.733
PRIORITIZING ONLY SEVENTY FIVE

02:54:37.800 --> 02:54:39.268
IN UP IN MADERA COUNTY DUE TO-

02:54:39.335 --> 02:54:42.538
COMPUTER. ISSUES CONNECTIVITY-

02:54:42.605 --> 02:54:44.740
AND JUST THEIR UNFAMILIARITY

02:54:44.807 --> 02:54:46.108
WITH ONLINE REGISTRATION

02:54:46.175 --> 02:54:48.978
PROCESSES. I'M AND WE OPENED UP

02:54:49.045 --> 02:54:50.713
TO AGE SIXTY FIVE AN UP AND

02:54:50.780 --> 02:54:52.014
ALMOST INSTANTLY WE HAD A

02:54:52.081 --> 02:54:53.482
POPULATION THAT WERE CALLING

02:54:53.549 --> 02:54:54.650
AND CALLING BECAUSE THEY JUST

02:54:54.717 --> 02:54:56.452
COULDN'T GET REGISTERED FAST

02:54:56.519 --> 02:54:58.054
ENOUGH. SO WE NEED TO BE ABLE

02:54:58.120 --> 02:55:00.223
TO CREATE SEPARATE CLINICS JUST

02:55:00.289 --> 02:55:02.124
SERVE VERY VOCAL POPULATIONS

02:55:02.191 --> 02:55:04.360
WITH SPECIFIC NEEDS. WHILE

WE'RE A PART OF THIS STATEWIDE

02:55:08.097 --> 02:55:08.798
SYSTEM THAT SERVES EVERYONE.

COLLEAGUES IF I CAN FOR THE

02:55:15.972 --> 02:55:17.273
BREADTH OF QUESTIONS I THOUGHT

02:55:17.340 --> 02:55:18.741
IT WAS QUITE INFORMATIVE AND

02:55:18.808 --> 02:55:20.176
IMPORTANT FOR US TO BE ABLE TO

02:55:20.243 --> 02:55:23.246
ASK THESE QUESTIONS. I WILL ADD

02:55:23.312 --> 02:55:24.947
FIVE QUESTIONS IF I CAN BUT

02:55:25.014 --> 02:55:26.315
FIRST I WANT TO ECHO SOME OF

02:55:26.382 --> 02:55:29.418
THE COMMENTS FROM DR PAM AS

EFFECTIVELY TO THE PUBLIC ABOUT

02:55:39.328 --> 02:55:41.330
HOW TRANSPARENCY LEADS TO A

02:55:41.397 --> 02:55:43.933
BETTER PROCESS ARE IMPORTANT

02:55:44.000 --> 02:55:46.469
GOALS FOR US TO HAVE MANY OF US

02:55:46.535 --> 02:55:48.037
HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT DATA

02:55:48.104 --> 02:55:50.106
AND TRANSPARENCY SO THAT WE CAN

02:55:50.172 --> 02:55:52.041
HAVE BETTER ACCOUNTABILITY. AND

02:55:52.108 --> 02:55:53.376
SINCE I FRAMED IT AND STARTED

02:55:53.442 --> 02:55:54.644
THE DISCUSSION ABOUT IT I

02:55:54.710 --> 02:55:57.813
REALLY DO WANT TO ASK DR ERIC

YOU'RE ASKING A REALLY REALLY

02:56:20.937 --> 02:56:22.805
IMPORTANT QUESTION AND THAT'S

02:56:22.872 --> 02:56:24.407
ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WHAT

02:56:24.473 --> 02:56:26.075
YOU'RE DESCRIBING IS REALLY

02:56:26.142 --> 02:56:28.678

OUR EQUITY GOALS IN TERMS OF

GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF THE

02:57:48.557 --> 02:57:50.760
VACCINE. WE'RE WE'RE DEFINITELY

02:57:50.826 --> 02:57:51.861
NOT THERE YET AND I THINK

02:57:51.927 --> 02:57:53.129
THAT'S WHY THE DATA IS REALLY

02:57:53.195 --> 02:57:54.997
IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE ALL OF US

02:57:55.064 --> 02:57:55.831
INCLUDING THAT THE STATE HEALTH

02:57:55.898 --> 02:57:57.566
DEPARTMENT. NEED TO BE HELD

02:57:57.633 --> 02:58:01.337
ACCOUNTABLE FOR THOSE EQUITY

02:58:01.404 --> 02:58:01.937

HARD FOR US TO SEE CLEARLY AND-

02:58:16.419 --> 02:58:19.055
I THINK WHAT I'M TRYING. TO

02:58:19.121 --> 02:58:22.958
UNDERSTAND IS THAT FOG THE

02:58:23.025 --> 02:58:26.695
REASON WHY WE HAD TO PIVOT IS

02:58:26.762 --> 02:58:29.231
THE LACK OF TRANSPARENCY AND

02:58:29.298 --> 02:58:31.600
DATA THE REASON WHY THE

02:58:31.667 --> 02:58:34.003
ADMINISTRATION NEEDED TO MOVE

02:58:34.070 --> 02:58:39.775

PAST WEEK TOLD ME THAT THEY'RE

03:01:37.152 --> 03:01:40.289
FLYING BLIND HIS WORDS NOT MINE.

03:01:40.356 --> 03:01:42.524
AND WHEN YOU HAVE THEM ON A

03:01:42.591 --> 03:01:44.360
FOGGY DEW IN THE VALLEY YOU

DON'T FLY WHEN YOU'RE BLIND.

03:01:45.894 --> 03:01:48.464

03:01:48.530 --> 03:01:50.499
FOR US TO MAKE SURE WE ARE.

03:01:50.566 --> 03:01:52.868

SOMETHING THAT- HAS CHANGED

03:02:19.928 --> 03:02:20.796
SINCE THE LAST TIME WE'VE

03:02:20.863 --> 03:02:22.731
SPOKEN. AND THAT WAS THE

03:02:22.798 --> 03:02:25.034
PERCENTAGE FOR ALLOCATION AND I

03:02:25.100 --> 03:02:26.468

03:02:29.571 --> 03:02:31.206
THE FOURTH QUESTION THAT I

ASKED ABOUT WHERE. WHERE ARE WE

03:02:33.509 --> 03:02:35.277
GOING FROM HERE. AND FOR

03:02:35.344 --> 03:02:36.612
CHANGING THAT PERCENT OF

03:02:36.679 --> 03:02:38.547
ALLOCATION TO BOTH REPRESENT

03:02:38.614 --> 03:02:40.683
POVERTY AS WELL AS RACE AND

03:02:40.749 --> 03:02:42.818
ETHNICITY. IT SEEMS AS IF WE

CLOSELY WITH WITH A CALIFORNIA

03:02:55.164 --> 03:02:57.266
SURGEON GENERAL DR- NADINE

BURKE HARRIS ON THIS ISSUE

03:02:59.101 --> 03:02:59.835
WHERE SHE HAS BEEN SPENDING

03:02:59.902 --> 03:03:02.971
TIME- DEVELOPING A FRAMEWORK ON

03:03:03.038 --> 03:03:05.074
HOW WE WOULD GIVE VACCINES TO

03:03:05.140 --> 03:03:07.943
CHEAT THE CHIEF EQUITY GOALS-

03:03:08.010 --> 03:03:10.012
PART OF. PART OF IT IS THAT WE

03:03:10.079 --> 03:03:12.014
NEED WE NEED WE NEED TO SORT OF

03:03:12.081 --> 03:03:13.215
EITHER THE QUALITY AND THEN

03:03:13.282 --> 03:03:15.084
THERES EQUITY WE DO WE NEED TO

03:03:15.150 --> 03:03:16.485
MAKE SURE THAT THE VACCINES ARE

03:03:16.552 --> 03:03:18.354
DISTRIBUTED FOR. INDUSTRY BUT

03:03:18.420 --> 03:03:20.322
IN A WAY THAT ARE REACHES. THE

03:03:20.389 --> 03:03:21.690
DIFFERENT POPULATIONS ACROSS

ARE MORE DISTANT

03:03:29.665 --> 03:03:31.867
DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED.

03:03:31.934 --> 03:03:33.268
AND SO WE ARE GOING TO BE USING

03:03:33.335 --> 03:03:36.238
THE- HEALTHY PLACES INDEX.

03:03:36.305 --> 03:03:38.307
SHOWED UP AREAS THAT ARE MOST

03:03:38.374 --> 03:03:39.475
THAT ARE MOST ANTI HAVE BEEN

03:03:39.541 --> 03:03:41.877
MOST IMPACTED BY IT BECAUSE-

VACCINE ALLOCATED TO AREAS. AND

03:03:51.720 --> 03:03:53.088
THAT MEANS WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

03:04:37.099 --> 03:04:38.667
BENEFIT OF OBVIOUS JUST FROM

03:04:38.734 --> 03:04:40.536
WHAT THE TYPICAL PERSPECTIVE.

03:04:40.602 --> 03:04:41.303

THE ONE SHOP VACCINE AND THEN

03:05:12.835 --> 03:05:14.503
THERE ARE OTHER OTHER VACCINES

03:05:14.570 --> 03:05:16.004
HAVE LOWER REFRIGERATION

03:05:16.071 --> 03:05:18.140
REQUIREMENTS. SO WE ANTICIPATE

03:05:18.207 --> 03:05:19.541
WE WANT TO BE IN THE POSITION

03:05:19.608 --> 03:05:21.310
OF THE VACCINE OF THE PIE

03:05:21.376 --> 03:05:24.646
INCREASES WE NEED A MAP OF THE

03:05:24.713 --> 03:05:26.748
NETWORK OF PROVIDERS THAT CAN

03:05:26.815 --> 03:05:31.019

AS ONE OF THOSE PROVIDERS WHO

03:05:34.523 --> 03:05:35.858
TOMORROW WILL BE GOING OUT TO

03:05:35.924 --> 03:05:37.459
ORANGE GROVE TO DISTRIBUTE

03:05:37.526 --> 03:05:38.727
VACCINES TORE FARMWORKER

03:05:38.794 --> 03:05:41.129
COMMUNITIES I'M- HAPPY TO TAKE

03:05:41.196 --> 03:05:42.664

KNOW THAT- THERE ARE THERE'S

03:05:44.633 --> 03:05:45.734
MUCH MORE THAT WE NEED TO DO IS

03:05:45.801 --> 03:05:47.870
A STATE. BUT REALLY WANTED TO

03:05:47.936 --> 03:05:49.137
DIG IN JUST A FEW MORE

03:05:49.204 --> 03:05:51.440
QUESTIONS IF I COULD. I WANTED

03:05:51.507 --> 03:05:52.741
TO UNDERSTAND THERE REALLY WAS

03:05:52.808 --> 03:05:54.576
A DISCREPANCY IN TERMS OF

03:05:54.643 --> 03:05:56.545
COUNTIES WITH DOSES

03:05:56.612 --> 03:05:58.614
ADMINISTERED. THEY'VE BEEN

03:05:58.680 --> 03:06:00.949
ALLOTTED A CERTAIN NUMBER. BUT

03:06:01.016 --> 03:06:02.951
WE HAVE DISCREPANCIES AS WIDE

03:06:03.018 --> 03:06:06.955
AS 50% AND 92% THAT WAS

03:06:07.022 --> 03:06:09.258
SUBMITTED TO US THIS WEEK. AND

03:06:09.324 --> 03:06:13.362
SO MY- QUESTION FOR YOU IS. HOW

03:06:13.428 --> 03:06:15.430
DO WE ENCOURAGE OUR LOCAL

03:06:15.497 --> 03:06:18.567
PARTNERS TO. BE USING OUR

03:06:18.634 --> 03:06:21.637

03:06:23.005 --> 03:06:26.408
PROVIDING TO THEM TO. ENCOURAGE

03:06:26.475 --> 03:06:29.344
AND INCENTIVIZE THAT. SO WE

03:06:29.411 --> 03:06:31.480
HAVE BEEN PROVIDING DIRECTORS

03:06:31.547 --> 03:06:33.515
TO- THE PURPOSE OF THE

03:06:33.582 --> 03:06:36.118
PROVIDERS PRIMARILY TO THE

03:06:36.184 --> 03:06:38.387
LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS. AND

03:06:38.453 --> 03:06:39.488
WE WERE IN CURRENT WORK WERE

03:06:39.555 --> 03:06:40.522
ENCOURAGING THEM WE'RE

03:06:40.589 --> 03:06:43.258
ENCOURAGING THEM TO NOT TO NOT

03:06:43.325 --> 03:06:44.560
TO HOLD ON TO VACCINES VERY

03:06:44.626 --> 03:06:46.495
LONG. WE WHAT WE WANT WE WANT

03:06:46.562 --> 03:06:49.398
TO GET THE VACCINE IN IN IN IN

03:06:49.464 --> 03:06:53.402
TO- THE COMMUNITY. AND SO WE

03:06:53.468 --> 03:06:54.636
HAVE BEEN PROVIDING DIRECTIONS-

03:06:54.703 --> 03:06:55.737
AND WHAT AND ONE OF THE

03:06:55.804 --> 03:06:57.406
CHALLENGES HAS REALLY BEEN

03:06:57.472 --> 03:07:00.142
IDENTIFIED CLOSING THE DATA GAP

03:07:00.208 --> 03:07:01.410
THAT WE HAD BECAUSE WE

03:07:01.476 --> 03:07:03.712
REALIZED. THE ONLY WAY THAT WE

03:07:03.779 --> 03:07:05.280
THE SOURCE OF THE TRUTH FOR

03:07:05.347 --> 03:07:09.518
DATA IS THAT. SOMEBODY'S WITH

03:07:09.585 --> 03:07:10.419
SOMEBODY INTERACTION IT IS. WE

03:07:10.485 --> 03:07:11.987
MAY NOT KNOW THAT THAT PERSON

03:07:12.054 --> 03:07:14.890
WAS VACCINATED UNTIL THAT GETS

03:07:14.957 --> 03:07:16.858
ENTERED INTO OUR REGISTRY. HOW

03:07:16.925 --> 03:07:18.560
IT GETS INTO OUR REGISTRY

03:07:18.627 --> 03:07:20.128
DEFERRED IF YOU HAVE AN

03:07:20.195 --> 03:07:21.597
ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD THAT'S

03:07:21.663 --> 03:07:22.698
WHAT THAT THAT ALREADY

03:07:22.764 --> 03:07:24.566
COMMUNICATE FOR REGISTRY WE

03:07:24.633 --> 03:07:26.234
KNOW ABOUT IT. IT WAS ON A

03:07:26.301 --> 03:07:28.670
PAPER SYSTEM ANY ATTRIBUTES WE

03:07:28.737 --> 03:07:30.505
KNOW ABOUT IT OR DO YOU WANT TO

03:07:30.572 --> 03:07:32.608
BE APPROVED- MANAGEMENT

03:07:32.674 --> 03:07:35.110
SOFTWARE SYSTEM. AND INDUCTOR

03:07:35.177 --> 03:07:36.878
COMMUNICATE TO OUR REGISTRY WE

03:07:36.945 --> 03:07:38.780
KNOW ABOUT IT AND IT'S TAKEN US

03:07:38.847 --> 03:07:40.349
A WHILE TO SORT OF REALLY SORT

03:07:40.415 --> 03:07:42.150
OUT WHY INFORMATION WASN'T

03:07:42.217 --> 03:07:43.986
GETTING INTO OUR SYSTEMS IN

03:07:44.052 --> 03:07:46.321
SOME CASES IT WAS NEVER ENTERED

03:07:46.388 --> 03:07:47.923
IT WAS ENTERED AT YOUR IT WAS

03:07:47.990 --> 03:07:50.125
ENTERED IN LATE. WE WORKED WITH

03:07:50.192 --> 03:07:51.293
SOME PLACES WHERE THEY HAVE

03:07:51.360 --> 03:07:53.829
THEY HAVE PILES OF PEOPLE THEY

03:07:53.895 --> 03:07:55.397
READ THE VACCINATED ADVANCE

03:07:55.464 --> 03:07:56.865
PAPERS WHERE WE ACTUALLY HAVE

03:07:56.932 --> 03:07:58.266
TO HELP THEM ANSWER ANSWER THAT

03:07:58.333 --> 03:08:00.202
THAT INFORMATION. AND SO WE'RE

03:08:00.268 --> 03:08:01.737
LEARNING TO THE PROBLEMS OF HOW

03:08:01.803 --> 03:08:03.705
TO MAKE A HOW TO HOW TO MAKE

03:08:03.772 --> 03:08:06.308

COUNTIES ARE- CHIU. TO HOLD A

03:08:16.885 --> 03:08:21.590
SECOND DOSE- YEAH WOULD BE A

03:08:21.657 --> 03:08:23.291
DEFINITE BUT BETTER GOOD CORD

03:08:23.358 --> 03:08:24.760
MANY OTHER CHALLENGE THAT THE

03:08:24.826 --> 03:08:25.961
WAY THIS GOVERNMENT START THE

03:08:26.028 --> 03:08:29.097
PROGRAM. THIS TORRENT OF THE

03:08:29.164 --> 03:08:30.932
PROBE WILL SAID YOUR DOES

03:08:30.999 --> 03:08:33.101

HAVE A SHOULD OF. CAPTION

03:08:42.077 --> 03:08:42.978
DESIGNATE OF THIS DOES THAT

03:08:43.045 --> 03:08:44.780
MISSION OF THE OF THE NATIVE AS

03:08:44.846 --> 03:08:47.883
OF THE FIRST. BUT IT'S EXACTLY

03:08:47.949 --> 03:08:49.851
THE SAME. BACK THERE IS NO

03:08:49.918 --> 03:08:50.452
DIFFERENT BECAUSE THERE'S NO

03:08:50.519 --> 03:08:53.088
DIFFERENT THAT. SO YOU CAN ALSO

03:08:53.155 --> 03:08:55.023
WON'T THAT HAPPENS ESPECIALLY

03:08:55.090 --> 03:08:56.858
MORE AND MORE PEOPLE BECOME

03:08:56.925 --> 03:08:58.927
VACCINATED YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO

03:08:58.994 --> 03:09:01.396
MAY RECEIVE THEIR FIRST DOSE AT

03:09:01.463 --> 03:09:02.197
ONE LOCATION BUT LATER ON

03:09:02.264 --> 03:09:03.932

THEM. AND SO THEN WHEN THAT

03:09:12.240 --> 03:09:13.575
HAPPENS IT BECOMES MORE

03:09:13.642 --> 03:09:15.444
DIFFICULT TO MANAGE THIS IDEA

03:09:15.510 --> 03:09:19.815
OF SOMETHING BEING. THE FIRST

03:09:19.881 --> 03:09:20.615

ANY OTHER. THAT HAVE MULTIPLE.

03:09:26.054 --> 03:09:28.156
APPLE HAS VACCINE APPETITE AB

03:09:28.223 --> 03:09:30.926
T. SHOCK AND YOU START SERIES

03:09:30.992 --> 03:09:33.061

GET YOUR SECOND SHOT. AS A

03:09:35.163 --> 03:09:36.898
ROUTING NEED TO REALLY THINK OF

COMPLETING A SERIES. OR DOING

03:09:44.573 --> 03:09:46.041
AFTER REALLY COMES DOWN TO THAT

03:09:46.108 --> 03:09:50.212
IT'S A. IT BECOMES AN EXERCISE

03:09:50.278 --> 03:09:51.046
IN. BOB WE IS REALLY INVENTORY

THEIR SERIES. AND SO THAT'S

03:09:58.854 --> 03:09:59.688
PART OF THAT FOR THE

03:09:59.755 --> 03:10:00.989
COMMUNICATION PLAN THAT WOULD

03:10:01.056 --> 03:10:02.424

03:13:03.338 --> 03:13:04.105
HUNDRED AND FIFTY SEVEN MILLION

03:13:04.172 --> 03:13:05.907

SO I THINK WE'RE GOING TO LEARN

03:13:58.960 --> 03:14:00.495
MORE ABOUT THE SUFFICIENCY OF

03:14:00.562 --> 03:14:03.031
THAT BECAUSE IT IS NOT ONLY THE

03:14:03.098 --> 03:14:03.565
THREE HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN

03:14:03.631 --> 03:14:04.833

HERE I THINK WE HAVE TO MAKE.

03:30:24.044 --> 03:30:24.578
SURE THAT THERE'S SOME TYPE OF

03:30:24.645 --> 03:30:25.145
LEAD WAY. TO THOSE THAT ARE

03:30:25.212 --> 03:30:27.214
MINISTER. ON THOSE VACCINES AT

03:30:27.281 --> 03:30:28.949
THE LOCAL LEVEL. MEANING HOW

03:30:29.016 --> 03:30:30.718
CAN YOU PLAN HOW CAN YOU EVEN

03:30:30.784 --> 03:30:32.019
PLAN A BUSINESS IF YOU DON'T

03:30:32.086 --> 03:30:33.120
KNOW WHAT'S COMING UP DOWN THE

03:30:33.187 --> 03:30:34.621
ROAD. AND IF YOU PLAN FOR

03:30:34.688 --> 03:30:36.190
WHAT'S COMING UP DOWN THE ROAD

03:30:36.256 --> 03:30:38.425
AND IT CHANGES ON YOU. THEN HOW

03:30:38.492 --> 03:30:41.095

03:30:42.663 --> 03:30:44.665
PUBLIC OUR CONSTITUENTS. TRULY

03:30:44.732 --> 03:30:46.133
UNDERSTAND I HAVE FAITH IN WHAT

03:30:46.200 --> 03:30:48.369
IT IS WE'RE DOING AND FAITH

03:30:48.435 --> 03:30:49.269
WHAT IS HAPPENING AT THE LOCAL

03:30:49.336 --> 03:30:51.638
LEVEL. WE GOT SO MANY CALLS

03:30:51.705 --> 03:30:54.108
COMING TO OUR OFFICE ONCE THERE

03:30:54.174 --> 03:30:55.175
WAS AN ANNOUNCEMENT OF SIXTY

03:30:55.242 --> 03:30:57.344
FIVE AND OLDER. BUT YET WE'RE

03:30:57.411 --> 03:30:58.245
IS THAT WORK ABILITY WITH THE

03:30:58.312 --> 03:31:00.280
LOCAL LEVEL WHAT I SEE HERE IN

03:31:00.347 --> 03:31:01.482
THESE TWO PROPOSALS COMING

03:31:01.548 --> 03:31:04.151
FORWARD. AGAIN I'LL MAKE THAT

03:31:04.218 --> 03:31:05.819
VOICE BE HEARD THAT I THINK

03:31:05.886 --> 03:31:07.087
THIS IS THE DISCUSSION THAT

03:31:07.154 --> 03:31:08.522
SHOULD BE HAPPENING. FROM THE

03:31:08.589 --> 03:31:10.457
LOCAL INPUT TO THOSE ON THE

03:31:10.524 --> 03:31:12.059
GROUND AND OFFERING SOLUTIONS

03:31:12.126 --> 03:31:14.495
NOT JUST. CRITICIZING THAT THIS

03:31:14.561 --> 03:31:16.196
PLAN IS IT WORKING OR THIS

03:31:16.263 --> 03:31:16.764
ISN'T WORKING OF THE STATE

03:31:16.830 --> 03:31:18.365
OVERSIGHT ISN'T WORKING. A

03:31:18.432 --> 03:31:20.067
THIRD PARTY NOW IS COMING INTO

03:31:20.134 --> 03:31:21.502
AND THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK NOW

03:31:21.568 --> 03:31:23.604
THIS PLAN. STARTS TO OFFER

03:31:23.670 --> 03:31:25.305
SOLUTIONS AND I THINK IT HAS IT

03:31:25.372 --> 03:31:28.542
HAS MERIT. IN ITS PRESENTATION.

03:31:28.609 --> 03:31:30.277
I THINK IT'S A VOICE THAT NEEDS

03:31:30.344 --> 03:31:31.979
TO BE HEARD. AND AS THINGS

03:31:32.046 --> 03:31:33.580
START TO MOVE FORWARD I WOULD

03:31:33.647 --> 03:31:35.349
ENCOURAGE- THAT WE LOOK INTO

03:31:35.416 --> 03:31:36.550
THESE THINGS AND ANSWER ANY

03:31:36.617 --> 03:31:38.185
QUESTIONS THAT MIGHT COME UP.

03:31:38.252 --> 03:31:39.920
BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY.

03:31:39.987 --> 03:31:41.622
WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE

03:31:41.688 --> 03:31:44.425
TO OUR CONSTITUENTS. THE FAITH

03:31:44.491 --> 03:31:46.560
THAT THIS THIS BODY THIS STATE

03:31:46.627 --> 03:31:47.828
IS MOVING FORWARD IN THE

03:31:47.895 --> 03:31:49.563
CONTABILIDADE OF THOSE THAT ARE

03:31:49.630 --> 03:31:51.098
OUT THERE. WHO KNOWS WHAT'S

03:31:51.165 --> 03:31:52.633
GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT WEEK WHO'S

03:31:52.699 --> 03:31:54.234
GOING TO THEN BE ALL BE ABLE TO

03:31:54.301 --> 03:31:55.969
GET THE VACCINE AND YET OF THAT

03:31:56.036 --> 03:31:57.371
INFRASTRUCTURE ISN'T THERE WE

03:31:57.438 --> 03:31:58.772
HAVE TO BE THE ONES TO ANSWER

03:31:58.839 --> 03:32:00.441
TO OUR COMMUNITIES. AND TO MAKE

03:32:00.507 --> 03:32:02.709
SURE THAT THERE'S A CALMNESS IN

03:32:02.776 --> 03:32:03.944
A IN A TRANSITION MOVING

03:32:04.011 --> 03:32:05.846
FORWARD. SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE

03:32:05.913 --> 03:32:07.681
THAT THERE WOULD BE ONGOING

03:32:07.748 --> 03:32:08.782
DISCUSSION WITH THOSE AT THE

03:32:08.849 --> 03:32:10.984
LOCAL LEVEL. MAYBE EVEN SOME

03:32:11.051 --> 03:32:12.886
TYPE OF A HEADS UP OF WHAT'S

03:32:12.953 --> 03:32:14.288
GOING TO CHANGE SO THAT PEOPLE

03:32:14.354 --> 03:32:16.223
COULD REACT TO IT. AND TO

03:32:16.290 --> 03:32:17.491
CREATE A PLAN THAT STARTS TO

03:32:17.558 --> 03:32:19.059
COME OUT AS MATT IT YOU KNOW

03:32:19.126 --> 03:32:20.427
ONCE THERE'S A SOMETHING THAT'S

03:32:20.494 --> 03:32:25.299
ANNOUNCED. THAT THEN THERE'S A

03:32:25.365 --> 03:32:25.866
PLAN TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE

03:32:25.933 --> 03:32:26.800
ALL THIS. PAGE SAYING THE SAME.

03:32:26.867 --> 03:32:29.103
BECAUSE OF WORDS HAVING TO SAY

03:32:29.169 --> 03:32:30.370
ONE THING. LOCALS ARE SAYING

03:32:30.437 --> 03:32:32.072
ANOTHER WE HEARD ON THE CALL

03:32:32.139 --> 03:32:33.841
HERE TODAY THAT IT'S ALL OVER

03:32:33.907 --> 03:32:36.009
THE PLACE BLIND IN THE FOG.

03:32:36.076 --> 03:32:37.277
THESE ARE THINGS THAT WE CAN'T

03:32:37.344 --> 03:32:39.113
DO AS ELECTED LEADERS THESE ARE

03:32:39.179 --> 03:32:41.048
THINGS AT THE STATE LEVEL WE

03:32:41.115 --> 03:32:42.449

03:32:54.261 --> 03:32:55.496
TWO PROPOSALS MISTER CHAIRMAN I

03:32:55.562 --> 03:32:57.297
THINK IT'S A VOICE THAT'S BEEN

03:32:57.364 --> 03:32:59.233
MISSING BUT IT ALSO OFFERS A

03:32:59.299 --> 03:33:00.701
SOLUTION RATHER THAN

03:33:00.767 --> 03:33:03.871
CRITICIZING. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY

03:33:03.937 --> 03:33:05.205

FONG. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR-

03:33:09.409 --> 03:33:11.445

READING OVER THESE PROPOSALS

03:33:13.113 --> 03:33:15.883
THERE'S A REOCCURRING- CONCERN

03:33:15.949 --> 03:33:17.651
OR OR OR OR ISSUE TO ADDRESS

03:33:17.718 --> 03:33:18.919
WHICH IS STAFFING AND PERSONNEL

03:33:18.986 --> 03:33:21.655
NEEDS- DO WE HAVE ENOUGH

03:33:21.722 --> 03:33:23.757
INDIVIDUALS IN THE PIPELINE

03:33:23.824 --> 03:33:25.592
BEING TRAINED TO ADDRESS THESE

03:33:25.659 --> 03:33:27.294
PROPOSALS I KNOW THAT THE THAT

03:33:27.361 --> 03:33:28.996
THE CHAIR AND NUMBER OF A OF

03:33:29.062 --> 03:33:30.731
THE MEMBERS ON THE COMMITTEE.

03:33:30.797 --> 03:33:33.233
HAVE BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT OVER

03:33:33.300 --> 03:33:34.735
THE LONG TERM ABOUT JUST

03:33:34.801 --> 03:33:36.937
SHORTAGES OF STAFF- TRAINING

03:33:37.004 --> 03:33:40.407
PROGRAMS- PIPELINES PATHWAYS-

03:33:40.474 --> 03:33:42.409
ESPECIALLY FOR MYSELF AND THOSE

03:33:42.476 --> 03:33:44.578
IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY- WE HAVE

03:33:44.645 --> 03:33:46.580
A CERTAINLY STAFFING CHALLENGES

03:33:46.647 --> 03:33:48.682
BUT WE OFFICE OBVIOUSLY HAVE.

03:33:48.749 --> 03:33:50.050
CONCERNS ABOUT TRYING TO FIND

03:33:50.117 --> 03:33:51.485
THOSE PEOPLE AND GET HIM INTO

03:33:51.552 --> 03:33:52.819
THE INTO THE AREAS THAT ARE

03:33:52.886 --> 03:33:55.856
NEEDED SO HOW DO WE ADDRESS

03:33:55.923 --> 03:33:57.758
THOSE CONCERNS OR HOW WOULD WE

03:33:57.824 --> 03:34:00.794
ASK OUR THOSE CONCERNS

03:34:00.861 --> 03:34:02.763
ADDRESSING THESE PROPOSALS.

03:34:02.829 --> 03:34:04.231
GOOD AFTERNOON ASSEMBLY NAME IS

03:34:04.298 --> 03:34:05.365
MICHELLE GIVEN THE NAME OF T.

03:34:05.432 --> 03:34:06.833
ACT AND I AND LIKE TO TAKE THAT

03:34:06.900 --> 03:34:08.368
QUESTION IF YOU DON'T MIND. I

03:34:08.435 --> 03:34:09.469
THINK THAT'S SUCH A GREAT

03:34:09.536 --> 03:34:10.804
QUESTION TO RAISE I KNOW WE

03:34:10.871 --> 03:34:12.339
HAVE DO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE

03:34:12.406 --> 03:34:13.473
PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE IN THE

03:34:13.540 --> 03:34:15.409
PIPELINE. A PART OF THE REASON

03:34:15.475 --> 03:34:17.344
WHY WE ARE PUTTING FORWARD THE

03:34:17.411 --> 03:34:18.812
BILL AB TWO FORTY IS TO NOT

03:34:18.879 --> 03:34:19.947
JUST LOOK AT THE IMMEDIATE

03:34:20.013 --> 03:34:21.114
INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS THAT WE

03:34:21.181 --> 03:34:22.916
HAVE. BUT THE INFRASTRUCTURE WE

03:34:22.983 --> 03:34:24.751
NEED THAT WE NEED IN ORDER TO

03:34:24.818 --> 03:34:26.320
DO JUST THAT TO HAVE THAT

03:34:26.386 --> 03:34:27.721
ADEQUATELY SKILLED TRAINED

03:34:27.788 --> 03:34:29.590
WORKFORCE IMPACT PLAN IN PLACE.

03:34:29.656 --> 03:34:30.724
I MEAN I THINK ONE OF THE

03:34:30.791 --> 03:34:31.491
THINGS THAT I WOULD JUST POINT

03:34:31.558 --> 03:34:32.926
OUT IS THAT THERE'S BEEN A LOT

03:34:32.993 --> 03:34:34.661
OF WORK OVER. THE LAST FEW

03:34:34.728 --> 03:34:36.730
YEARS LOOKING AT TYPE LINES TO

03:34:36.797 --> 03:34:38.832
HEALTHCARE REPORT I THINK- PART

03:34:38.899 --> 03:34:41.768
OF THE COMMISSION'S FINDINGS-

03:34:41.835 --> 03:34:44.037
THAT WAS FOUND WAS THAT. PUBLIC

03:34:44.104 --> 03:34:45.138
HEALTH REPORTS WITH ONE OF THE

03:34:45.205 --> 03:34:46.607
TOP WORKFORCE AREAS THAT WE

03:34:46.673 --> 03:34:47.975
NEEDED TO INVEST IN AS WELL BUT

03:34:48.041 --> 03:34:50.310
WE DON'T HAVE THE SAME AD. KIND

03:34:50.377 --> 03:34:51.778
OF INCENTIVES TO DRIVE UP THE

03:34:51.845 --> 03:34:52.946
PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE I'LL

03:34:53.013 --> 03:34:54.114
GIVE YOU A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES

03:34:54.181 --> 03:34:55.449
ABOUT CRITICAL WORKFORCE THAT

03:34:55.515 --> 03:34:56.083
WE NEED AND LOCAL HEALTH

03:34:56.149 --> 03:34:58.085
DEPARTMENTS. SUCH AS PUBLIC

03:34:58.151 --> 03:34:59.319
HEALTH NURSES PUBLIC HEALTH

03:34:59.386 --> 03:35:00.787
NURSES MANY OF THEM ARE

03:35:00.854 --> 03:35:02.189
REGISTERED NURSES THAT GO ON

03:35:02.256 --> 03:35:03.323
AND THEY HAVE TO GET ANOTHER

03:35:03.390 --> 03:35:05.158
CREDIT CREDENTIAL BEYOND TO THE

03:35:05.225 --> 03:35:07.361
R. N. THAT THEY THEY HAVE TO

03:35:07.427 --> 03:35:08.629
PAY ADDITIONAL FUNDING AND TAKE

03:35:08.695 --> 03:35:09.997
ADDITIONAL CLASSES TO GET THAT

03:35:10.063 --> 03:35:12.666
CERTIFICATION. AND YET- WE HAVE

03:35:12.733 --> 03:35:13.600
A SHORTAGE OF PUBLIC HEALTH

03:35:13.667 --> 03:35:14.901
NURSES IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND

03:35:14.968 --> 03:35:16.169
WE NEED TO GROW THAT PIPELINE

03:35:16.236 --> 03:35:18.005
AND INCENTIVIZE MORE TO COME

03:35:18.071 --> 03:35:19.840
INTO THAT FIELD. SO I THINK-

03:35:19.906 --> 03:35:21.275
PART OF THEIR YOU KNOW WE HAVE

03:35:21.341 --> 03:35:22.843
A TWO PRONGED APPROACH THE

03:35:22.909 --> 03:35:24.011
FIRST PRONG IS REALLY LOOKING

03:35:24.077 --> 03:35:25.312
AT HOW DO WE INCREASE THE

03:35:25.379 --> 03:35:26.613
RESOURCES FOR LOCAL HEALTH

03:35:26.680 --> 03:35:28.382
DEPARTMENTS TO BE ABLE TO RAMP

03:35:28.448 --> 03:35:29.850
UP THEIR STAFFING CAPACITY

03:35:29.916 --> 03:35:31.051
BECAUSE YOU HEARD BY DIRECTOR.

03:35:31.118 --> 03:35:32.786
ABBAS EARLIER TODAY WE DO RISK

03:35:32.853 --> 03:35:34.021
LOSING MANY OF THE POSITIONS

03:35:34.087 --> 03:35:35.422
THAT WE STOCK UP OR THROUGH

03:35:35.489 --> 03:35:37.424
COLD. THEY COULD THEN BE

03:35:37.491 --> 03:35:38.759
TRANSLATED TO WORKING ON OTHER

03:35:38.825 --> 03:35:40.093
THINGS TO ADDRESS A LOT OF THE

03:35:40.160 --> 03:35:40.761
CRITICAL ISSUES IN OUR

03:35:40.827 --> 03:35:42.429
COMMUNITIES AND SO THAT'S THE

03:35:42.496 --> 03:35:43.497
FIRST APPROACH IS GETTING THE

03:35:43.563 --> 03:35:45.065
RESOURCES SO THAT THEY CAN

03:35:45.132 --> 03:35:45.632
INCREASE THEIR STAFFING AND

03:35:45.699 --> 03:35:46.933
SELECT. STAFFING COULD BE

03:35:47.000 --> 03:35:48.602
FLEXIBLE BECAUSE WHAT WE ALSO

03:35:48.669 --> 03:35:49.403
HAVE IS A LOT OF CATEGORICAL

03:35:49.469 --> 03:35:51.371
FUNDING THAT REQUIRES YOU TO

03:35:51.438 --> 03:35:53.140
ONLY HAVE A STAFF THAT CAN DO

03:35:53.206 --> 03:35:54.574
THIS DISEASE ONLY AND CAN'T

03:35:54.641 --> 03:35:55.442
REALLY TRANSLATE TO OTHER

03:35:55.509 --> 03:35:57.077
THINGS. BUT THE SECOND PRONG

03:35:57.144 --> 03:36:04.384
APPROACH IS REALLY AT AND. THE

03:36:04.451 --> 03:36:05.018
REASON WHY WE'RE ASKING FOR THE

03:36:05.085 --> 03:36:05.652
STUDY TO BE FUNDED AS A THAT WE

03:36:05.719 --> 03:36:06.320
CAN REALLY LOOK AT. OKAY HOW DO

03:36:06.386 --> 03:36:07.220
WE GET THIS WORK FOR. WHAT'S

03:36:07.287 --> 03:36:08.088
WHAT DOES THE WORK FIRST TO

03:36:08.155 --> 03:36:08.989
LOOK LIKE IN A LITTLE. DEPART

03:36:09.056 --> 03:36:10.157
BUT WHEN HE IT ALSO. TO LOOK AT

03:36:10.223 --> 03:36:11.291
IN ORDER TO IN. THAT WE-

03:36:11.358 --> 03:36:12.859
SKILLED AND HIGHLY TRAINED

03:36:12.926 --> 03:36:14.227
STAFF AND- AGAIN PUBLIC HEALTH

03:36:14.294 --> 03:36:15.495
NURSES IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE THE

03:36:15.562 --> 03:36:18.198
EPIDEMIOLOGY. LABORATORY AND-

03:36:18.265 --> 03:36:21.702
OTHERS. MANY CLASSIFICATIONS

03:36:21.768 --> 03:36:22.302
THAT NEED TO BE HIGHLY SKILLED

03:36:22.369 --> 03:36:24.905
AND SPECIALIZED. R. AS THE

03:36:24.971 --> 03:36:26.740

GUIDANCE. PART OF THIS GUIDANCE

03:49:19.579 --> 03:49:21.247
AS PERMISSIVE AS ITS CURRENT

03:49:21.314 --> 03:49:22.915
STATE LAW AND IT DOESN'T CHANGE

03:49:22.982 --> 03:49:24.450
THE REQUIREMENT FOR PAPER

REQUIRING PAPER IS A

03:49:29.489 --> 03:49:30.623
SIGNIFICANT BARRIER TO

EFFORTS IMPLEMENTED BY THE

WHEN SOMEBODY RENEWS MEDIC HOW

03:49:55.748 --> 03:49:57.350
THEY ALREADY HAD ON FILE. WHEN

03:49:57.416 --> 03:49:58.651
THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN THEN COUNTY

03:49:58.718 --> 03:49:59.886
WORKERS REACH OUT TO THE

PERSON- TYPICALLY THEY DO THIS

03:50:02.288 --> 03:50:03.623
OVER THE PHONE AND THEY USUALLY

03:50:03.689 --> 03:50:06.159
MAKE TWO ATTEMPTS- IF THEY ARE

03:50:06.225 --> 03:50:07.493
ABLE TO GET A HOLD OF THAT

03:50:07.560 --> 03:50:09.061
PERSON IF WE WERE ALLOWING FOR

03:50:09.128 --> 03:50:10.930
TELEPHONIC ATTESTATION AND THEY

03:50:10.997 --> 03:50:12.632
HAVE A REASONABLE EXPLANATION

03:50:12.698 --> 03:50:13.933
AS TO WHY THE INCOME DOESN'T

03:50:14.000 --> 03:50:15.701
MATCH. THE ISSUE WOULD BE

03:50:15.768 --> 03:50:17.370
RESOLVED THEN AND THERE-

03:50:17.436 --> 03:50:19.005
WITHOUT THAT THE PERSON HAS TO

03:50:19.071 --> 03:50:20.573
FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO A SWORN

IN THE MAIL OR GET IT OVER TO

03:50:23.709 --> 03:50:25.311
THE COUNTY. THIS IS A

03:50:25.378 --> 03:50:26.712
SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE FOR

HAVE EASY WAYS TO DO THINGS

03:50:32.585 --> 03:50:36.022
OVER THE INTERNET. AND I'LL

03:50:36.088 --> 03:50:36.589
BLOW THINGS TO A WORKER. SO

AS ACCEPTED AS IN PAPER- DH CS

03:50:45.298 --> 03:50:46.199

03:50:48.201 --> 03:50:49.335
CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND

03:50:49.402 --> 03:50:51.037
MEDICAID SERVICES AS TO HOW TO

03:50:59.912 --> 03:51:01.581
DISCUSSION TO BE ABOUT HOW TO

03:51:08.921 --> 03:51:10.756

FACING IN OUR AND ENROLLMENT IN

03:55:02.621 --> 03:55:04.890
THE LATINO COMMUNITY IS THE

03:55:04.957 --> 03:55:07.293
CONCERN INTERFERE ABOUT

COBIT AND INSURED PROGRAM

03:55:22.942 --> 03:55:24.743
CALIFORNIA WAS OUT THE GATE

03:55:24.810 --> 03:55:27.279
EARLY IN APRIL TWENTY TWENTY

03:55:27.346 --> 03:55:29.448
WITH WHAT IT THEN CALLED THE P.

03:55:29.515 --> 03:55:30.950
E. PRESUMPTIVE ELIGIBILITY FOR

03:55:31.016 --> 03:55:33.986
COPING PROGRAM. AND WE APPLAUD

03:55:34.053 --> 03:55:35.321
THE DEPARTMENT FOR ITS

03:55:35.387 --> 03:55:38.190
INNOVATION IT'S INITIATIVE AND

03:55:38.257 --> 03:55:39.859
ITS CREATIVITY AND HAVING

03:55:39.925 --> 03:55:41.927
CREATED THAT AS THE STATE ONLY

03:55:41.994 --> 03:55:44.363
PROGRAM WHICH NOW IS BEING

03:55:44.430 --> 03:55:46.131

ABSOLUTELY CLEAR ABOUT THAT

03:55:55.574 --> 03:55:58.878
STATUS IS NOT A DISQUALIFIER.

03:55:58.944 --> 03:56:01.113
BUT THE CONCERN AGAIN IS THAT

03:56:01.180 --> 03:56:03.449
THE WAY QUESTIONS ARE ASKED IS

03:56:03.516 --> 03:56:06.285
A DETERRENT TO MANY IMMIGRANT

03:56:06.352 --> 03:56:07.753
FAMILIES. AS OTHERS SPEAKERS

03:56:12.791 --> 03:56:15.327
WILL BE WITH US FOR A WHILE.

03:56:15.394 --> 03:56:17.196
THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ITSELF

ASSUMES THAT FOR THE MEDIC HOW

03:56:19.131 --> 03:56:21.500

WILL CONTINUE AT LEAST UNTIL

03:56:25.838 --> 03:56:28.007
THE END OF THIS YEAR. WE KNOW

03:56:28.073 --> 03:56:29.174
THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE

03:56:29.241 --> 03:56:31.243
SERVICES AS MANY OTHER STATE

03:56:31.310 --> 03:56:33.913
DEPARTMENTS ARE BURDENED

03:56:33.979 --> 03:56:36.081
SIGNIFICANTLY WITH ALL THE WORK

03:56:36.148 --> 03:56:38.017
THAT IS TO BE DONE. BUT WE

03:56:38.083 --> 03:56:39.251
RESPECTFULLY SUBMIT THAT

03:56:39.318 --> 03:56:41.420
FINDING A SOLUTION TO THIS

03:56:41.487 --> 03:56:43.522
PARTICULAR PROBLEM OF MAKING

03:56:43.589 --> 03:56:45.157
THE COVERED UNINSURED MEDICAL

03:56:49.528 --> 03:56:52.364
CAN BE DEPLOYED IN COMMUNITIES

03:56:52.431 --> 03:56:54.833
TO REACH THE FARM WORKERS TO

03:56:54.900 --> 03:56:56.435
REACH THE FOOD WORKERS. TO

REACH PEOPLE IN LOW INCOME

03:56:59.004 --> 03:57:00.573
COMMUNITIES WHERE MANY

IMMIGRANTS LIVE WORK AND GATHER

03:57:04.043 --> 03:57:07.479
MUST BE AN ESSENTIAL PART OF

03:57:07.546 --> 03:57:09.615
THE SOLUTION. THE OTHER ISSUE I

03:57:09.682 --> 03:57:14.153
WAS ASKED TO ADDRESS. CONCERNS

03:57:14.219 --> 03:57:19.024
HOW THE MEDICAL PROGRAM COVERS

03:57:19.091 --> 03:57:22.227
BLOOD PRESSURE MONITORING COSTS

03:57:22.294 --> 03:57:25.264
AND THE MONITORS THEMSELVES

03:57:25.331 --> 03:57:28.867
DURING PREGNANCY AND GENERALLY.

03:57:28.934 --> 03:57:33.839
WHY IS THIS SEEMINGLY DETAILED

03:57:33.906 --> 03:57:37.209
SMALL ISSUE APPROPRIATE FOR THE

03:57:37.276 --> 03:57:39.912
COMMITTEE'S CONSIDERATION. IN

03:57:39.979 --> 03:57:43.349
SHORT RACIAL EQUITY IN BIRTH

03:57:43.415 --> 03:57:47.219
OUTCOMES IN OUR STATE. THE

03:57:47.286 --> 03:57:49.288
AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY

03:57:49.355 --> 03:57:51.523
THERE'S A DISPROPORTIONATE

03:57:51.590 --> 03:57:55.060
BURDEN IN HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE

03:57:55.127 --> 03:57:58.063
HYPERTENSION AND RELATED

DISORDERS THAT CAN KILL PEOPLE

03:58:01.600 --> 03:58:03.802
AND THIS IS PARTICULARLY A

03:58:03.869 --> 03:58:06.905
CONCERN DURING PREGNANCY IN

AS OTHER POPULATIONS TO DIE AS

03:58:14.680 --> 03:58:16.115
A RESULT OF PREGNANCY

03:58:16.181 --> 03:58:18.550

AS OTHER NEWBORNS IN CALIFORNIA

03:58:28.794 --> 03:58:33.799
AND UNFORTUNATELY I THINK WE

03:58:33.866 --> 03:58:37.136
CODE PANDEMIC HAS MET WITH

03:58:37.202 --> 03:58:38.504

03:58:48.480 --> 03:58:50.849
PROGRAMS IN THE STATE THAT ARE

03:58:50.916 --> 03:58:54.720
DOING AMAZINGLY EVIDENCED BASED

03:58:54.787 --> 03:58:56.522
WORK TRYING TO GET OUT THESE

03:58:56.588 --> 03:58:58.524

MONITORING DURING THE PANDEMIC

03:59:10.135 --> 03:59:12.838

03:59:12.905 --> 03:59:14.973
OF THESE INITIATIVES TO GET OUT

03:59:15.040 --> 03:59:16.442
COULD JUST TO GET OUT THE

03:59:16.508 --> 03:59:19.878
DISPARITIES IN BIRTH OUTCOMES.

03:59:19.945 --> 03:59:23.082

03:59:23.148 --> 03:59:25.918
THE CHOICE TO PROVIDE THIS

DURABLE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT WHEN

THERE ARE LONG DELAYS AND THIS

04:00:09.361 --> 04:00:11.063
IS VERY VERY DANGEROUS

04:00:11.130 --> 04:00:14.633

LOCAL LEVELS- COUNTIES

04:16:07.552 --> 04:16:09.854
INCLUDED. THAT HOW HOW

04:16:09.921 --> 04:16:11.989
REALISTIC IS IT NOW TO CONTINUE

04:16:12.056 --> 04:16:13.324
TO ASK FOR THE LOCAL

04:16:13.391 --> 04:16:15.860
GOVERNMENTS TO CONTINUE TO PUT

04:16:15.927 --> 04:16:17.762
IN FROM THEIR GENERAL FUND.

04:16:17.829 --> 04:16:19.230
WITHOUT HAVING SOME MEANINGFUL

04:16:19.297 --> 04:16:20.898
DIALOGUE TO START TO ADDRESS

04:16:20.965 --> 04:16:23.000
SOME OF THOSE AND THE PROPOSAL

04:16:23.067 --> 04:16:24.736
HAS BEEN PROPOSED AND PROPOSAL

04:16:24.802 --> 04:16:26.671
NUMBER TWO STARTS TO MOVE THAT

04:16:26.738 --> 04:16:29.040
DISCUSSION FORWARD- ESPECIALLY

04:16:29.107 --> 04:16:31.008
WHEN YOU LOOK AT- WHEN THERE

04:16:31.075 --> 04:16:33.611
IS- FEDERAL PORTIONS ONLY COVER

04:16:33.678 --> 04:16:35.379
ROUGHLY SIXTY FIVE PERCENT. DID

04:16:35.446 --> 04:16:36.714
ANY OF ALLUDED TO IT IN YOUR

04:16:36.781 --> 04:16:38.049
PRESENTATION ANSWERING TO THE

04:16:38.116 --> 04:16:40.218
PROPOSAL THERE IS- THAT

04:16:40.284 --> 04:16:41.953
DISPARITY THAT'S THERE BUT

04:16:42.019 --> 04:16:43.721
GETTING BACK TO WHAT WE'VE ALL

04:16:43.788 --> 04:16:45.456
SEEN HERE IN THE LAST YEAR AND

04:16:45.523 --> 04:16:47.425
WHO KNOWS WHAT. THE NEXT YEAR

04:16:47.492 --> 04:16:48.926
OR EVEN TWO YEARS FROM NOW IS

04:16:48.993 --> 04:16:51.195
GOING TO BRING US IN THIS REALM

04:16:51.262 --> 04:16:53.331
OF PANDEMICS OF DIFFERENT

04:16:53.397 --> 04:16:55.099
THINGS THAT ARE COMING OUR WAY.

04:16:55.166 --> 04:16:57.101
BUT WE DO KNOW THAT AT THE

04:16:57.168 --> 04:16:59.103
LOCAL LEVEL THE IMPACT WITH

04:16:59.170 --> 04:17:02.140
BUSINESS- HAS BEEN SEVERELY HIT

04:17:02.206 --> 04:17:04.675
WITH BUSINESS AND THEN- THOSE

04:17:04.742 --> 04:17:06.711
THAT WOULD BY- HOMES FOR

04:17:06.778 --> 04:17:08.179
PERSONAL PROPERTY TAXES ARE

04:17:08.246 --> 04:17:10.348
GOING TO THE COUNTY LEVEL- IT

04:17:10.414 --> 04:17:11.983
WAS. A STRETCH TO MAKE SURE

04:17:12.049 --> 04:17:13.551
THAT WE'RE FEELING THAT IN WHEN

04:17:13.618 --> 04:17:14.385
I SAT ON THE BOARD OF

04:17:14.452 --> 04:17:16.320
SUPERVISORS AND NOW KNOWING THE

04:17:16.387 --> 04:17:18.289
IMPACT THAT'S GOING ON I THINK

04:17:18.356 --> 04:17:20.324
IT MERITS- SOME TYPE OF

04:17:20.391 --> 04:17:21.425
DISCUSSION TO START TO TALK

04:17:21.492 --> 04:17:23.394
ABOUT- SOME OF THOSE ISSUES AND

04:17:23.461 --> 04:17:25.496
HOW THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT. IS

04:17:25.563 --> 04:17:26.864
MEETING THAT GAP THAT'S IN

04:17:26.931 --> 04:17:28.666
THERE ESPECIALLY AGAIN WHEN YOU

04:17:28.733 --> 04:17:31.068
SEE THAT 30% OF A PUBLIC

04:17:31.135 --> 04:17:33.471
HEALTH. HOSPITALS RECEIVE NO

04:17:33.538 --> 04:17:35.139
STATE GENERAL FUND MONEY THAT

04:17:35.206 --> 04:17:36.474
WOULD MEAN THAT THE LOCAL LEVEL

04:17:36.541 --> 04:17:38.509
HAS TO MAKE UP FOR THAT SO I'M

04:17:38.576 --> 04:17:40.011
I LOOK FORWARD TO FURTHERING

04:17:40.077 --> 04:17:42.613
THIS DISCUSSION AND WORKING-

04:17:42.680 --> 04:17:44.515
