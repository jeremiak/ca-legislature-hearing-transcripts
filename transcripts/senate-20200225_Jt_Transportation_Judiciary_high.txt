INFORMATIONAL HEARING SET TRANSPORTATION SITS HERE WITH THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. SURE JACKSON IS WITH ME TODAY. AND SHOULD WE WILL JOINTLY RUN THESE HEARINGS. SO GOOD AFTERNOON. THE COMMITTEE IS HOLDING A HEARING TODAY ON. INFORMATIONAL HEARING ON MORE MOBILITY OPTIONS MORE DATA TRANSPORTATION PRIVACY ISSUES INSURED MOBILITY DATA USE. AND I WOULD LIKE TO THANK- SIR JACKSON. AS WELL AS THEIR COMMITTEE STAFF IN THE PARTNERSHIP WITH OUT WITH TRANSPORTATION AND JUDICIARY ON INSURANCE. WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THANK US SENATE GOVERNMENT FINANCE COMMITTEE- SAM ACQUIRE WHO'S HERE. AND. WE TO US WE HAVE. OKAY. WE WANTED TO THANK ALSO- ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN WHO IS AUTHORED LEGISLATION ON SURE MOBILITY DURING THIS THE LEGISLATIVE SESSION SO WE WILL. HEAR FROM HER. AS WE GO THROUGH THE HEARING. AND I WANTED IS ALSO THANK HER FOR TAKING ON THIS VERY COMPLEX SUBJECT PROMPTING ALL OF US TO TAKE A MORE COMPREHENSIVE DIVE. THROUGHOUT THE DAY TO DAY AND- THE INFORMATIONAL HEARING AND WE LOOK FORWARD FROM HEARING AND WORKING WITH HER ON OF LEGISLATION. NOW FINALLY I WANT TO THANK ALL OUR STAFF THAT WORKED ON THIS HEARING WE'VE WE WORK VERY HARD TO PREPARE OURSELVES FOR THE SHARING. AND WE'D LIKE TO THANK EVERYBODY. NOW TODAY'S HEARING. IS ACTUALLY THE SECOND OF TWO JOINT INFORMATIONAL HEARINGS ON THE TOP WITH THEM SURE MOBILITY THE INNOVATIVE- SHARED USE OF VEHICLE BICYCLE OTHER MODES OF TRANSPORTATION INCLUDING RIDE HAILING AND- THE RECENT PHENOMENA OF ELECTRIC SCOOTERS WE HAD OUR FIRST HEARING. BACK IN NOVEMBER BY THE SENATE GOVERNMENTS AND FINANCE COMMITTEE IN THE ASSEMBLY TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE THAT HEARING EXPLORED WHAT STATE RIGHT REGULATION. MAY BE APPROPRIATE FOR SURE MOBILITY AND WE'RE DISCRETION SHOULD BE LEFT TO LOCAL DISCRETION. AT TODAY'S HEARING. ZEROS IN ON A PARTICULAR ASPECT OF SURE MOBILITY. THE GOVERNOR OF DATA GENERATED THROUGH DEPLOYMENT OF THE USE OF THE OF THE AND THE USE OF SHARE MOBILITY DEVICES. SURE MOBILITY DEVICES ARE TRANSFORMING URBAN TRANSPORTATION. WHERE THEY ARE AVAILABLE- RIGHTS DELIVERIES IN SHORT TERM RENTALS OF BIKES CARS SCOOTERS SMOKE. CAN BE USED NOW SECURED WITH THE TOP% OF THE PHONE AND LIKE OTHER INNOVATIONS THE- SURE MOBILITIES MAY PROVIDE- VARIOUS BENEFITS CONVENIENCE CONNECTING RIDERS TO TRANSIT. AND REPLACING CAR TRIPS WITH SCOOTER BY CRISIS HOWEVER. THESE BENEFITS ARE NOT A GIVEN FOR EXAMPLE STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT- TENDENCIES CONTRIBUTE TO CONGESTION AND TRIED TRANSIT RIDERSHIP- HAS. DROPPED IS ACTUALLY- GOING DOWN DR SCOOTERS CAN BLOCK SIDEWALKS OR GET THROWN INTO CREEKS AND PONDS- WHICH IS WHAT MY WIFE COMPLAINS ABOUT WHEN WE DO OUR CREEK CLEANUP SO COME SOMEBODY THESE ARE IN. THE CREEK. SO IT IS A IT IS- AN ISSUE BOTH REQUIRE OVERSIGHT. TO HEAR THAT ACCESS IS DISTRIBUTED ADEQUATELY EQUITY TO IT. NOW TO ENSURE MOBILITY SERVICES WORK IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST LOCAL AUTHORITIES THAT MANAGE THE PUBLIC RIGHT AWAY THE DATA. SO DO THE ACADEMIC RESEARCHERS WHO CREEK AND THE INDEPENDENT RIGOROUS KNOWLEDGE- NEEDED TO INFORM- GOOD POLICYMAKERS. IN SP ONE WE FOR EXAMPLE PUT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN TO. A. R. D. FUND FOR ACADEMIC RESEARCH ON TRANSPORTATION. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT THE SURE MOBILITY SERVICES GENERATE HUGE AMOUNTS OF DATA. MOST IMPORTANTLY ON WHERE THE VEHICLES ARE THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION NOW COLLECTS SIGNIFICANT TNC TRIPPED OUT AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO POLLUTE THE REQUIRE REQUIRE SHARED SCOOTER INSURED BIKE OPERATORS TO PROVIDE THEM WITH DATA. SUCH AS THE LOCATION OF AVAILABLE DEVICES AND THE PAPS UPON WHICH THE DEVICES ARE BEING WRITTEN. HOWEVER SURE IN THE STATUS WITH LOCAL AUTHORITIES ARE BEYOND ALSO WITH RESIST SOME KIND OF ALARM. THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE THAT. AND WAS USING THAT THE MOVEMENTS OF SPECIFIC INDIVIDUALS COULD BE DEDUCED BREACHING- WRITERS RIGHT TO PRIVACY. TO MITIGATE THE PRIVACY RESTORE IS BEEN CALLS TO LIMIT THE TRIPPED OUT OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES MAY REQUIRE. TO DEAL FOR TO BE DO YOU HAVE THE DATA FIGHT AN AGGREGATED TRIPPED OUT OF. IN RESPONSE SOME AUTHORITIES AND ACCURACY OF EXPRESSED CONCERN. THAT THIS LIMIT ON DATA SHARING WOULD SEVERELY LIMIT. AFFECTED TRANSPORTATION PLANNING MANAGEMENT RESEARCH. SO DURING TODAY'S HEARING. WERE FIRST GOING TO EXPLORE WHAT DATA ARE NEEDED BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND OTHER GOVERNMENT ENTITIES AND ACADEMIC RESEARCHERS TO FULFILL THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES AND WRIST TO IT AND INDIVIDUAL PRIVACY THAT COMES WITH GENERATING ENSURING THE DATA. THEN WE'RE GOING TO TURN TO A DISCUSSION OF BEST PRACTICES FOR PROTECTING THE PRIVACY OF INDIVIDUALS USING SURE MOBILITY DEVICES. NOW TRANSPORTATION- FORTUNATELY IS EVOLVING RAPIDLY. IN THE FUTURE IT MAY BE TECHNOLOGICALLY FEASIBLE FOR CITIES TO ACTIVELY MANAGE TRAFFIC BY MONITORING THE MOVEMENT OF THOMAS VEHICLES AND DIGITALLY COMMUNICATING STOPLIGHTS AND ROAD CLOSURE INFORMATION RIGHT BACK TO VEHICLES. OR THE FUTURE COULD LOOK VERY DIFFERENT ULTIMATELY THIS HEARING. SHOULD ELIMINATE ILLUMINATE HOUSE STATE WIDE GUARD RAILS CAN PROTECT CONSUMER PRIVACY. WHILE AT THE SAME TIME ENSURE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS CONTINUES TO WORK AND WORK BETTER FOR THE PUBLIC THANK YOU AND I'LL TURN IT OVER TO CENTER JACKSON A SHE SHE HAS SOME OPENING REMARKS SENATOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF MISTER CHAIR FOR WORKING WITH US ON THIS IMPORTANT. ISSUE AND HOLDING THIS INTRODUCTORY- INFORMATIONAL HEARING- PEOPLE ASK WHAT IS PRIVACY HAVE TO DO WITH RIDE SHARING. AND THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS IT IS A LOT TO DO WITH IT- BECAUSE WE ARE COLLECTING DATA. WE ARE COLLECTING ENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF DATA AND PEOPLE WHO RIDE THESE. VEHICLES IN ADONIS KNOW THAT THEIR INFORMATION IS BEING ACCUMULATED AND ONE COULD SAY THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY BEING SURVEILLED. BECAUSE THAT IS IN FACT PART OF WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE IS THAT- AT THE AS MORE DATA IS COLLECTED AS INFORMATION IS COLLECTED EVERY FIVE SECONDS OF A RIDE- THE USER ALL THAT. EQUIPMENT HAS NOT BEEN NOTIFIED NOT BEEN REQUESTED TO PROVE TO CONSENT TO THAT INFORMATION BEING MADE AVAILABLE AND FRANKLY HAS NO KNOWLEDGE OF MOST COMES. AS WE LOOK AT TECHNOLOGY AND CLEARLY THERE ARE EXCITING THINGS GOING ON I MEAN USING ELECTRIC BIKES AND SCOOTERS WHICH WE KNOW OF EXPLODED IN POPULARITY AND REVOLUTIONIZED AND WE'RE NOT SURE FOR BETTER FOR WORSE BUT CERTAINLY ARE REVOLUTIONIZING. OUR TRANSPORTATION LANDSCAPE YET. AS THEY GET THE THESE APPS BASED SERVICES CONTINUE TO PROLIFERATE POLICY MAKERS THAT TO US. HAVE TO EXAMINE THE WEALTH OF DATA COLLECTED AND HOW THE INFORMATION BEING YOU WE DON'T KNOW THIS. IT COLLECTS WE'VE KNOWING WHAT'S BEING WITHIN SO. A IT'S MY HOPE AND I BELIEVE GIVEN THE PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO BE TESTIFYING TODAY WE WILL BE ABLE TO EXPLORE. THE RESPONSIBLE USE OF SHARED MOBILITY. DATA AND WAYS WE CAN AGAIN CONCERNS SAFEGUARD CONSUMER PRIVACY THERE'S A BALANCING HERE BETWEEN THE TECHNOLOGY IN ITS ADVANCES AND THE- POSSIBILITY AND THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THIS INFORMATION IS GOING TO BE USED TO GET PERSONAL INFORMATION ABOUT US. WHETHER IT'S BY SOME KIND OF I KEEP IT IN A FIRE VOTE VERSUS OUR NAME BUT JUST THINK OF YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER- BEING USED NOW TO FOLLOW EVERYTHING YOU DO. NOW WE MAY NOT YOU KNOW YOUR NAME BUT WE DO KNOW WHAT THAT SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER IS DOING. AND THE QUESTION IN OUR SOCIETY IS AS A DEMOCRACY IS A STATE WHERE THE RIGHT OF PRIVACY IS CONSTITUTIONALLY EMBEDDED IN OUR IN. THE CONSTITUTION STATE. LAW LIBERTY PROP PRICE. THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA MADE IT CLEAR THE PRIVACY IS A CRITICALLY IMPORTANT COMPONENT SO. OF UP I'M HOPING WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE GROWING ACCUMULATION OF DATA NACHOS BY PRIVATE COMPANIES BUT BY GOVERNMENT ENTITIES- KNOWING THAT THE MORE DATA THAT'S COLLECTED AND DISSEMINATED CAN AGAIN IDENTIFY PARTICULAR CALIFORNIANS. MAKING OUR PRIVACY RIGHTS MORE VULNERABLE SO- THE GOAL I HOPE IS AS WE HAVE THIS DISCUSSION WE CAN ENSURE THAT ANY DATA SHARING LAWS AND REGULATIONS. ENSURE DATA IS AVAILABLE BUT THAT IT DOES NOT PLACE PERSONAL INFORMATION AT RISK THAT TO ME IS THE FIRE WALL. WE CAN COLLECTED WE CAN FIGURE OUT BETTER ROAD PATTERNS WE CAN FIGURE OUT TIME OF DAYS THE CAPS MORE P. ARE INCLINED TO USE THE VEHICLES. ARE MORE THE PATTERN. BUT NOT SPECIFICALLY ARE FIGHTING WOULD YOU FOR I DO IN MORNING WE GET UP WHETHER WE- STOP AT STARBUCKS OR SOME CAR PLACE THE WAY WORK. HEAVEN KNOWS THEY CAN IT TELL YOU WHAT KIND OF DRINK OR MORE LIKELY TO GET THE NOT THIS IS THE CASE FOR MISSION TECHNOLOGY MAKE AVAIL. SO WE KNOW STUDY STUDY SHOWS AND I'M SURE CAMPUS WILL ATTEST. AT LOCAL IN THERE IS A CORRELATION. EVEN WHEN CERTAIN IDENTIFIERS ARE STRICT HEY. WE WILL WE ARE. SEEMINGLY JULY INFORMATION AND BE RE IDENTIFY. AND I KNOW EXACTLY LATER THE SENATOR BUT THE HISTORY RIGHT NOW BUT THAT'S BECAUSE I'M AT HIM THAT'S BECAUSE I HAVE DE FROM WHEN HE GOT IN HIS CAR AND STOPPED TO GET HIS HIS COFFEE THIS MORNING- WE DON'T KNOW THAT THOSE THINGS ARE HAPPENING AND WE NEED TO BE AWARE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT IS. ARE ANONYMOUS HELLO XIN INFORMATION ARE NOT REPENT OF FIGHTING AND CAN TO PUT PER AND I BELIEVE WE'LL BE HEARING TESTIMONY THAT IS SOPHISTICATED TECHNOLOGY GETS THEY'RE ABLE TO RE IDENTIFY EVEN THOUGH WE DE IDENTIFY SO BOTTOM LINE IT'S IMPERATIVE I BELIEVE THAT WE FIND A WAY TO GET LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND OTHER ENTITIES THE DATA THEY NEED TO CARRY OUT IMPORTANT PUBLIC POLICY PURPOSES THAT WE'RE GOING TO HEAR TODAY WITH OUT. FROM OUR THIS AND THE SURVEILLANCE I IT IT WE ARE ALL TOO QUICKLY BECOMING WE NEED TO PUT OUR FOOT DOWN TO PUT A STOP. TO DISSEMINATION PURSE INFORMATION IN OUR SOCIETY. WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT THE COLLECTION AND DISSEMINATION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION IS DONE IN A THOUGHTFUL AND INTENTIONAL MATTER. GIVING THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT OF PRIVACY IT'S TO DO RESPECT THEM WITH THAT- I WANT TO THANK THE- THE CHAIR- AND LOOK FORWARD TO THIS TESTIMONY TODAY. DAY OF THE REQUIRED YOU HAVE SOME COMMENTS AND THANK YOU FOR SHARING THE LAST HEARING WE HAD ON THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR MADAM CHAIR- GRATEFUL TO BE WITH YOU IN PRE SHEET- BOTH YOU AND YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE. AS THE CHAIR SAID I'LL BE VERY BRIEF- THE SENATE GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE COMMITTEE ALONG WITH THE ASSEMBLY TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE. HELD A HEARING ON E. SCOOTERS. LATE IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. AT HEARING WAS FOCUSED ON EXPLORING CHALLENGES AT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN E. SCOOTER COMPANIES HAVE AT BOTH FACE. AS THEY TRIED TO BE ABLE TO ENCOURAGE GOLDEN STATE RESIDENTS TO NON AUTOMOBILE TRANSPORTATION MODES WHILE. ENSURING THE SAFETY IN EXCESS ABILITY OF THOSE DEVICES. FOR WRITERS AND PEDESTRIANS. IN OVER THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS WE'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITIES LONG AS MANY MEMBERS OF THE- FINANCE COMMITTEE WE ARE. ME WITHIN WE NEED TO MEET WITH REPRESENTATIVES FROM ALL SIDES OF THE ISSUE TO BE A- BEST DETERMINE. POTENTIAL NEXT STEPS AND I KNOW THAT THIS HEARING WILL ALSO HELP DETERMINE WHAT. NEXT STEPS HE- CHAIR SURE WHAT. THANK YOU TO ASSEMBLY WOMAN FREE. AS WELL AS THE RUMOR. FOR THEIR WORK IN THE SPACE DABO. DECIDED TO. WORK WITH THE CAN. I AM. REALLY GET THIS. AND WE HAVE ONE OPPORTUNITY. TO GET THIS VERY GRATEFUL TO THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN WHO'S HERE TODAY AND OF COURSE. TO LISTEN LIMóN IS WELL. LISTEN RIGHT HERE. IN THE COMING. UP CAN WE WERE LIST COLDER DEVELOP. TOOLS OF THE ROAD WILL. FOR EACH PRESENT ON LOCKS CONTROL THESE DEVICES. BUT BERNIE LOCAL. AND LOOK FOR TO WORKING. WITH MISS JACKSON MISTER BELL. OF COURSE AUTHOR. ON JUNE YOU FOR A LOT. TO TURMAN. YES THANK YOU A- WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE A REMARKS YOU'RE GOOD OKAY. OKAY ANY OTHER MEMBERS WOULD LIKE MAKE ANY ON THE SUB WILL PROCEED NOT ALL RIGHT WE'RE GONNA MOVED FIRST WE WILL PER AND OF SHARED MOBILITY AND THE TEENS SEE DATA USE- WE HAVE- OR WITH WAY OF THE FIRST BATTLE COME FOR PLEASE- DR- GIULIANO DIRECTOR OF THE MET TRANS TRANSPORTATION CENTER. UNIVERSE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA- WITH HER ASSISTANT SO LEADER RENTALS GENERAL MANAGER OF ITALY DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION DOCTOR REGINA SO- KALO C. E. O. A POPULOUS. TARO'S C. C. VAHRAM. ED APPALLED PRIVACY AND SECURITY POLICIES UBER DOUG ITO- DIRECTOR CONSUMER PROTECTION ENFORCEMENT AT CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION CHECK UPS NO TECHNOLOGY CIVIL LIBERTIES ATTORNEY AT ACLU NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. OKAY WE ARE HERE IN DOCTOR'S GIULIANO YOU HAVE THE FLOOR AND WELCOME. YOU MAY. BACK IS GONNA BE TO SOMEBODY NO MATTER WHAT I DO I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT DOCTOR CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THE VETERANS FIRST BEFORE YES- I WANTED TO INTRODUCE MYSELF I'M CHEN ON- FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA- I AM THE DIRECTOR OF THE MED TRANS TRANSPORTATION CENTER- ALL THE DIRECTOR OF THE PACIFIC SOUTHWEST REGION UNIVERSITY TRANSPORTATION CENTER- THAT CENTER RICH IS A CONSORTIUM OF EIGHT UNIVERSITIES WE ARE FUNDED THE US DEPARTMENT INTERPRETATION FIVE. CITY IN CALIFORNIA M. THE I. BEING ON BEHALF OF THE FIVE UNIVERSITIES TODAY. I HAVE TO ACKER EMAIL HEY IS A- PH DIS IN THE YEAR AT THE OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA- HE IS THE ONE WHO ACTUALLY MOTIVATED US TO BE HERE TODAY- AND- HE DID 90% OF ALL THE WORK I'M GOING TO SHOW. SO I WANT TO MAKE CLEAR IS THAT TO. THE SITTING OVER THERE IN THIS PRESENTATION. DID YOU WANT ANYTHING MORE- MISTER BELL. OKAY THANK YOU- I UNDERSTAND I HAVE EXACTLY FIVE MINUTES I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE ON THE SCREEN. WHAT DO I DO. TRY THAT ARE PERFECT THANK YOU I AM NOT TECHNOLOGICALLY BRILLIANT OKAY- I HAVE ONLY FIVE MINUTES AND SO I'M GOING TO MAKE FOUR POINTS THE FOUR POINTS I'M GOING TO MAKE- IS NUMBER ONE THAT ACADEMIC RESEARCH IS IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST IN THIS PARTICULAR FIELD- TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH DEPENDS ON DECEMBER GET DATA. DATA COLD JUNE IS NOT THE SAME AS DATA SHARING AND PRIVACY CONSTRUED CONCERNS CAN BE ADDRESSED- IN THE RESEARCH WORLD- I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE ALSO FOR. GIVING US THE OPPORTUNITY AT THE UNIVERSITY TO ACTUALLY SPEAK AT THIS HEARING- I DON'T KNOW THAT THE UNIVERSITY RESEARCH VOICES ALWAYS HURTS THIS IS A MUCH APPRECIATED BY US- THIS FIRST POINT IS THAT. MAKE RESEARCH IS IN THE PUBLIC. AND WHAT IS WORSE IS THAT. REESE IS WHAT GIVES US BETTER ON OF HOW THINGS WORK RIGHT- AND HOW PEOPLE BEHAVE IT HELPS TO INFORMED IT HELPS TO INFORM PUBLICPOLICY- AND IT'S CREATES A NEW TOOLS IT'S THE RESEARCH THAT IS ACTUALLY CREATED ALL NEW MODES OF TRANSPORTATION THAT WERE. OF AND- THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT- SO IMPORTANT I THINK TO THE PUBLIC COMMUNITY- AND THIS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE STANDARDS OF RESEARCHERS SO HIGH- SO WHEN WE DO RESEARCH IN THE ACADEMY WE ARE LOOKING. AT CAN. CAN THESE FINDINGS BE REALIZABLE- WE ARE LOOKING FOR COMPREHENSIVENESS AND RECUR- WE ARE LOOKING FOR IN AN INSTANT OBJECTIVITY. AN WE ARE LOOKING FOR QUALITY THAT MEETS A PEER REVIEW US CRITERIA- IN SO REALLY WHAT WE ARE INTO HERE IS ACADEMIC RESEARCH THAT CREATES A PROCESS- THAT IS SURE IS QUALITY OF RESEARCH. OKAY NEXT ON THIS POINT- IS- TO MOVE A LITTLE BIT INTO THE TRANSPORTATION SPHERE MORE DO MORE SPECIFICALLY AND THE QUESTION OF BY VERY SKEPTICISM- TRAVEL BEHAVIOR RESEARCH- WE ARE IT WE'RE IN CALIFORNIA HAVE SOME VERY AMBITIOUS GHG REDUCTION TARGETS. OF THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR IS ACTUALLY AN INCREASING SHARE OF ALL OF OUR G. G. EMISSIONS BECAUSE OTHER SECTORS ARE DO BETTER AND- WE DON'T SEE HOW WE'RE GOING SHE THOSE TARGETS WITHOUT JUSTIN WILL BEHAVE. SO IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US. BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND RISE STRAP TO A DECISION. FINALLY HAVE A THIS IS JUST SOME EXAMPLES OF THE KINDS OF QUESTIONS- THAT COME UP TO YOU- AND THAT HAVE THEIR- GROUNDING EVEN RESEARCH THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE AND JUST TO PICK OUT ONE OF THESE- HOW SHOULD HER. SB PRIORITIZE THAT A QUESTION OF DEMAND RIGHT THERE'S A DEMAND OUT THERE FOR SCOOTERS THERE'S A DEMAND OUT THERE FOR TEA AND SEES THERE'S THE BAND OUT THERE FOR LOCAL DELIVERY TRUCKS. AND EVERYBODY'S COMPETING FOR YOUR SPACE SO HOW DO YOU DECIDE IT WILL YOU NEED. THIRTY NEED SOME STANDING ALL THE MAN PATTERNS A TO MAKE GOOD DECISIONS THE SECOND POINT IS THAT. RESEARCH DEPENDS ON DISAGGREGATED DATA- THIS AGGREGATE DATA MEANS DATA- USUALLY OF INDIVIDUALS AND WE ACTUALLY HAVE A VERY LONG HISTORY OF. TRAVEL BEHAVIOR RESEARCH BASED ON INDIVIDUALS- THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS ACTUALLY COLLECTED CALL TRAVEL DIARY INFORMATION SINCE THE NINETEEN SIXTIES. AND THOSE TYPES OF SURVEYS- ABS. VALUABLE TO US IN BEING ABLE TO UNDERSTAND HOW PEOPLE- TRAVEL AND WHAT THEIR MOTIVATIONS ARE- IF WE HAVE INDIVIDUAL DATA CAN ALWAYS AGGREGATED RIGHT SEC. WE ALWAYS SCALE IT UP WE COULD ALWAYS COME UP TO LEVELS WHERE WE'RE BEYOND THAT INDIVIDUALS INTO GROUPS OR POPULATIONS- INDIVIDUAL OF BE A DATA ACTUALLY ALLOWS FOR THE BROAD THIS TYPE OF RESEARCH- SO IF WE REALLY WANT TO UNDERSTAND HOW WOMEN WITH CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE. TO HAVE A PREFERENCE FOR DRIVING AS OPPOSED TO TEAM PUBLIC TRANSPORT WE CAN ACTUALLY ZERO WITH THE PRINT. PATIENTS OF THAT PARTICULAR pEVER IS UP WHEN WE ARE MEANING DATA WE NEVER KNOW BUT WE FIND AND THOSE DISCOVERIES ARE ALL ARE YOU FOR. THIS IS. SLIGHTLY GIVES YOU JUST SOME QUICK POLLS OF THE TYPE OF RE C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; THAT OF&lt;/c&gt;</u> YOU ARE DEALING WITH IN THAT IS A REAL RELY ON THIS TYPE OF DATA SO THE FOR QUESTION ON THIS HERE IS DO DOCK WITH MOBILE IN RIGHT FIELD SERVICE COMPLIMENTS. FOR OR TO- TRAVEL MODES WELL THE WAIT IS THAT IS ACTUALLY TO LOOK AT INDIVIDUAL TRAVEL BEHAVIOR. I IT'S NOT THAT THESE QUESTIONS COULD NOT NECESSARILY BE ADDRESSED BUT WE CAN ADDRESS THEM A WHOLE LOT BETTER- IF WE HAVE THE DETAILED DATA. JUST TO GIVE YOU A COUPLE OF HIS EXAMPLES OF THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE HAVE FOUND WAS INDIVIDUAL I'VE STATED YOU HAVE SOME EXAMPLES ON THAT SLIDE- THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION FOR EXAMPLE OF GENTRIFICATION AND TRANSIT RICH NEIGHBORHOODS. AT AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS WHEN PEOPLE MOVE AROUND THESE NEIGHBORHOODS THE END UP WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE HIGHER INCOMES THAT ARE LESS LIKELY THE TRANSIT IN THERE FOR WE GET REAL BENEFIT THAT PUBLIC. LAST MONTH WELL LOOKING AT. TWO HUNDRED UNDER IN. THAT MOST OF THE TIME WE GET WITH REESE IS IN VIEW MILES TRAVELED. POINT THREE PM DATA CALL IS NOT THIS THING IS DATA WE HAVE ALL OF BIG IN RESEARCH OF HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL DATA- THAT IS USED FOR THE PURPOSE OF RESEARCH SO IT'S COLLECTED AND IT IS STORED. IT IS NOT THE STANDARDS FOR HOW IT IS ACCESSED ARE VERY STRICT SO IT'S VERY POSSIBLE TO HAVE EXTREMELY SENSITIVE DATA- CUT THE CENTRAL DATA WAREHOUSE THAT IS ESSENTIALLY UNDER LOCK AND KEY- KEEP IT OUT OF THE CLOUD KEEP IT OUT OF. HE SORT OF NEXT TURNER. AN THOSE ARE DAYS THAT WE HAVE OF BEING ABLE TO PROTECT THIS DATA- AND THEN ONCE YOU HAVE THAT THEN YOU CAN MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT WHO HAS ACCESS FOR WHAT PURPOSE- A GOOD EXAMPLE OR THE US CENSUS DATA CENTERS THAT ARE ALL OVER THE UNITED STATES THERE ONE AT UCLA THERE'S ONE AT UC BERKELEY FOR EXAMPLE. AND THAT GIVES. ACCESS TO COME TO PRIVATE INFORMATION THAT THE GOVERNMENT COLLECTS ON INDIVIDUALS- YOU ONLY GET ACCESS TO IT BY VIRTUE OF AN APPLICATION.  REVIEW OF THAT APPLICATION AND ACCEPTANCE OF THAT APPLICATION THEN WHEN YOU HAVE ACCESS TO THAT DATA YOU CAN USE THE DATA BUT YOU CAN TAKE IT ANYWHERE. YOU HAVE TO USE IT IN A BOX FACILITY YOU CAN NEVER DOWNLOAD IT OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT SO WE HAVE LOTS OF EXAMPLES- ALREADY AROUND OF HOW WE CAN DO THAT. SO ONCE YOU HAVE THAT SYSTEM YOU COULD IMAGINE A WORLD IN WHICH- WE HAVE SOME DETAILED INFORMATION THAT'S MADE AVAILABLE UNDER SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES FOR RESEARCH PERSON PURPOSES- WE HAVE ANOTHER SET OF DATA- THAT IS- USED FOR REPORTING AND FOR. COMMON STANDARDS THAT CENTER. AGO I MY LAST NIGHT THANK YOU- AND THEN YOU COULD HAVE SOME THAT IS OPEN TO THE BUT- I'VE ALREADY MET. PRIVACY CONCERNS CAN BE ADDRESSED THROUGH THESE ACCESS RULES I'M HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT THAT RELATED. SO I'M JUST GIVE ALL THAT. WE HAVE MANY EXAM THAT WE GIVE YOU OF. DATA SOURCES THAT WE KEEP- AND THEN FINALLY AT THE LAST SLIDE HERE'S A FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU- BUT ALSO WE KNOW THERE ARE LOTS OF ISSUES THAT WE WERE NOT ABLE TO BRING UP IN OUR FIVE MINUTE SLOT HERE- BUT WE'RE HAPPY TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT. WHETHER THERE ARE QUESTIONS. UP IS A PROVIDE PROVIDERS SHOULD BE SUBJECT THE SAME RULES SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU I WILL WILL HOLD QUESTIONS TO THE OTHER PANEL THAT WHILE IT'S EVERYBODY QUESTIONS OF. IF THAT'S ALRIGHT WITH EVERYBODY. AND SO WHERE RENTALS. SHE'S THE GENERAL MANAGER OF LA- DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION SO. VERY BUSY PERSON. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SENATOR FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO COME IN A DRESS YOU AGAIN WE APPRECIATE THE DIFFICULT IMPORTANT WORK. WE WANT TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO SUPPORT THAT SO- I'M HERE TODAY AS AS REALLY ONE OF THE ONLY PEOPLE HERE WHO LIKE YOU IS ACCOUNTABLE DIRECTLY TO THE PUBLIC MY JOB IS TO SERVE THE PUBLIC GOOD. AND THE STORY THAT BROUGHT US HERE TODAY'S EXISTED SINCE THE FIRST TWO WERE RIGHT ABOUT A DECADE AGO CAN AT STAKE FOR US IS WHETHER LOCAL GOVERNMENT WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE THE CHEAP ROLLER MAY. OR WHAT PRIVATE COMPANIES WILL TAKE. CHARGE OF OUR SO. STREETS AND SKIES. WITH RIDE SHARING UBER AND LIFT MADE THE CLAIM THAT INNOVATION AND PROGRESS ARE AT ODDS WITH LOCAL OVERSIGHT. AND THE RESULT IS THAT OUR CITIES WERE LEFT TO HANDLE THE COLLATERAL DAMAGE. IN TRAFFIC AND- CONGESTION. LIMITED SCOPE TO EMISSIONS. GROWING PUBLIC. CONCERN DO YOU SEE. WHAT TRANSIT USE. AND THE MISTREATMENT OF WORKERS THAT. FIRE THIS JUST LETTER. TO PASS IT BE FIVE. THIS IS THE- OPPOSITE OF WHAT WE WERE A MESS. THAT WHY THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES AND NOW. NINETY CITIES. WHY RECALL. BACCHUS UP. YOUR BASIC DATA. OUT THERE. GOAL THE PUBLIC OF. WE CAN. TO THEM TO. ST INSIDE. CLEARANCE. THE COMPLAINTS CAN. TO MAKE AN- IT EASIER AT AND MAKE HOW INFORM BY WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENING OUR STREETS. TO BE CLEAR WE AB. DO NOT. PERSONAL IN. ABOUT RIGHT. QUITE I WAS TO. ALL OF THE PROVIDE TO AVOID MANIPULATION AND MISINFORMATION THE CORPORATIONS HAVE ENGAGED IN PREVIOUSLY TO THOSE WHO SUPPORT LESS STRINGENT ALTERNATIVES I HAVE A SIMPLE GEN IF A PRIVATE COMPANY WERE PROVIDED INCOMPLETE INACCURATE OR FALSE DATA HOW WOULD YOU KNOW. HIS WORK HERE IS PRETTY FOR DESPITE WHAT SOME MAY HAVE YOU BELIEVE LET ME LAY OUT HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS THE FIVE SECONDS AFTER SCOOTER IN THE PUBLIC RIGHT OF WAY IS LOCKED OR UNLOCKED THE COMPANY NO FIVE SAT AND SENDS ITS LOW. THIS SAME CHOIR ALLOWS. CHECK THE FOR PROFIT COMPANIES IF OUR TEAM UNLOCKS THE SCOOTER AND THE COMPANY DOESN'T SEND A NOTIFICATION THEN WE KNOW THAT ALL OF THEIR DATA IS POTENTIALLY SUSPECT WE DECIDED THIS TO ALLOW WHAT ANGELES TO HAVE THE LARGEST MOBILITY PILOT IN THE COUNTRY WITH THE LIMITATIONS ON THE NUMBER OF UNEASE THAT SIMPLE IS MEANT THE CITY. WILL ALSO EVELYN WITHOUT NEW IDEAS WAS AVOID ANOTHER GATE WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS OUT GOOD IS YOU IN THE PUBLIC WRITER WAY. ANY SENSE THE CITY THE ROUTE AGAIN THE CARD IS NOTIFIED CITY WHEN THEY MAY A SCHOOL FROM ONE LOCATION TO ANOTHER WHEN THEY TAKE A SCOOTER OFF LINE FOR MAINTENANCE OR BECAUSE IT'S OUT OF SERVICE. UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE A NUMBER OF FALSE PREMISE PEATED BUT FOLKS ARE QUESTIONING CITIES RIGHT TO REQUEST THE NOTIFICATION DATA SOMEONE TO CLARIFY A FEW MISCONCEPTIONS FIRST THE DATA IS SAFE AND YOUR- WE CLASSIFY THE STATE AS CONFIDENTIAL. IT'S UP. AND IT IS NOT SUB THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT THE DATA IS SECURE ACCESS EVEN WITHIN DEPARTMENT IS STRICTLY LIMITED AND WE HAVE RULES AND GUIDELINES. FOR IT'S MY TO SAY SHE- OR ANYTHING ELSE. THESE LARGE AND SMALL HAVE STRONG RECORD OF HIGHLY SO AND FOR. NAMES ADDRESSES SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS CHECKING ACCOUNT AND CREDIT CARD NUMBERS THAT INFORMATION IS FAR MORE SENSITIVE THAN THE INFORMATION WE GET FROM OUR CAUCUS PROGRAM SECOND WE COLLECT NO INFORMATION ABOUT WRITERS EVEN IF SOMEONE WERE ABLE TO LEGALLY ACCESS OUR ROB DID DOCTORS DATA% THEY NEED TO HACK OTHER SOURCES TO COBBLE TOGETHER AN INDIVIDUAL'S IDENTITY. CONTRACT WE KNOW EXTENSIVE THE COMP KEEP WHEN PEOPLE ARE NOT USING THEIR VEHICLES THIRD THIS WILL NOT BECOME A TOOL FOR SURVEILLANCE BY LAW ENFORCEMENT THE DATA WE RECEIVE ARE ONLYACCESSIBLE TO LAWN FORCE THERE WAS. OR WARRANT FURTHER MORE THE DAY WE HAVE WOULD BE A LITTLE WELL YOU TO LAW ENFORCEMENT WE HAVE RECEIVED ZERO REQUESTS FOR IT FOR THE THIRD PARTY INTERMEDIARY ARE NOT A SOLUTION OR SUBSTITUTE FOR LOCAL OVERSIGHT THERE BENEATH WANT BOOKER I'D AND COME. PRIVATE SECTOR ACT PROVIDE GREAT EIGHT IS AN THIS BUT THE PUBLIC SECTOR IS BEST EQUIPPED TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC AND STE YOU HAVE NO TO GAIN. I'M PROUD SANTA TRACKER. NATION'S LARA. BUT HE'S CENTER STE HAVE COMPLIED WITH OVER. COMPLAIN OF FALL INSTEAD EVEN AS RIGHTS HAVE INCREASED SINCE APRIL WHEN OUR PILOT LAUNCHED WE HAVE SEEN MORE THAN SEVEN MILLION RIDES ON THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND DACA SCOOTERS AND BIKES JUST IN THE CITY INSTEAD OF CLOSING THE DOOR ON DOC LIST AND WAIT FOR OTHER CITIES TO ACT WE OPENED OUR DOORS TO MOBILITY COMPANIES AND SAID LET'S FIGURE THIS OUT TOGETHER. BUT THERE'S NO WAY WE CAN RUN THE LARGEST PROGRAM COUNTRY WITHOUT BALLOT INSIGHT INTO WHAT'S HAPPENING ON OUR STREETS AND SIDEWALKS EVENT WHEN FLEET TAX. THREE THINGS AND AUTONOMOUS VHICLES VERGE. LIKE TO MAKE. IS ABOUT ROAD AND THE SKY WE CANNOT MAKE IN THE DARK WE'VE WHAT HAPPENED WHEN WE TRY PRIVATE COMPANIES ARE ACCOUNTABLE TO SHAREHOLDERS AND WE ARE ACCOUNTABLE TO EVERYONE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU OF WILL NOW TURN TO DOCTOR. OF REGINA OF A CLUE THOUGH- CO POPULOUS AND- YOU DON'T HAVE TO STAND UP THERE IF YOU DON'T WANT TO YOU CAN I MEAN SORRY. WHATEVER YOU CHOOSE. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON TEARS FELL AND JACKSON MEMBERS OF THE TRANSPORTATION JUST YEAR COMMITTEES THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME HERE TODAY TO DISCUSS THE IMPORTANT ISSUES RELATED TO MOVE THE DATA AND PRIVACY MY NAME NECKLACE WELL I'M THE CEO AND CO FOUNDER POPULOUS A DATA A SAN FRANCISCO BASED SOFTWARE COMPANY POPULOUS IS A THIRD PARTY PLATFORM THAT EIGHT CITIES IN. AND COST EFFICIENT TO. SECURELY UP TO DATA FROM ABILITY OPERATE. TO CREATE ENFORCE POLICIES TO MANAGE MOBILITY SERVICES THAT OPERATE IN THE PUBLIC RIGHT OF WAY TO MY EXPERIENCE IS THE CEO POPULOUS I SPENT THE MAJORITY OF MY PROFESSIONAL CAREER AS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION FOCUSED ON SUSTAINABILITY AND CLIMATE CHANGE. AND AS AN ACADEMIC RESEARCHER AT MIT THE BURKE STANFORD AND UC DAVIS I RECEIVED A PHD IN TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS FROM MIT IN TWENTY TWELVE AND I ALSO HOLD A BACHELOR'S DEGREE IN COMPUTER SCIENCE WHICH I FROM CORNELL APPROXIMATELY TWENTY. WHEN YEAH TO EXPAND THEIR NEW COMMERCIAL SERVICES IN SAN FRANCISCO I WAS A PROJECT LEAD FOR THE BAY AREA'S TWENTY FIVE YEAR REGIONAL PLAN THE METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION A COURT CHALLENGE THAT WE FACE DOES THAT WE HAD ZERO INFORMATION ABOUT HOW THESE NEW SERVICES FOR CHANGING TRAVEL PATTERNS INTO TWELVE I BEGAN TO WORK ON NEW SOLUTIONS AND METHODS TO HELP AGENCIES. AS THE INFORMATION THEY WOULD NEED DRIVE PROGRESS ON KEY PUBLIC. STATE ABILITY. WILL ACT. TO TRANSPORTATION. SIMILAR TO OUR FIRST PRESENTER HERE I COLLECTED TRAVEL SURVEY DATA IS THAT ACTUALLY LED TO SOME OF THE FIRST STUDIES THAT INDICATED THE IMPACTS OF UBER AND LEFT ON OUR TRANSPORTATION. DUMPSTER SOME OF THE MOST CITED TODAY. TODAY ALL DESCRIBE THE NATURE AND ROLE OF THIRD PARTY SOLUTIONS. FORMER EMIGRATE SIR OR AS A GREAT DEAL OF TIME. ABOUT THE HOUSING OF DIFFERENT GOVERNOR BOTTLES FOR THE DATA SHARING OVER THE PAST EIGHT YEARS. TODAY THERE ARE THREE COMMON. THE DATA SURE. THE FIRST IS BEING PRE AGGREGATED DATA FROM OPERATORS. THE KEY CRITICISM OF THIS APPROACH IS THAT SOME AGENCIS DO NOT FEEL THAT OPERATORS CAN TRUTHFULLY SELF REPORT ON THEIR SERVICES WHICH IS FAIR. THE SECOND IS THAT YOU SING IT PARTS OF THIRD PARTY SOLUTIONS SUCH AS POPULOUS OF AGENCIES ARE ABLE TO THEN RECEIVE- ROD DISAGREED DATA FROM. OPERATORS TO THE AUDITING SERVICES AND CAN THEN JUST LEAVE TH INFORMATION THEY NEED AND WANT IN FORM OF CHARTS REPORTS VISUALISATIONS AND OTHER DATA IT'S BETTER. THAT ALLOW THEM TO MAKE THE KEEP. AND PLANNING TO. THEY NEED TO MAKE AS THERE ARE STORIES OF THE PUBLIC RIGHT OF WAY. AND THE THIRD MODEL IS FOR CITIES TO DIRECTLY RECEIVE ROD DISAGGREGATED DATA FROM ABILITY OPERATORS I FIRST POPULOUS IN LARGE PART BECAUSE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF KEY CHALLENGES THAT I WITNESSED PUBLIC AGENCY OR STRUGGLE WITH. WHEN DATA IS DELIVERED DIRECTLY TO PUBLIC AGENCIES SPECIFICALLY HOLDING INDIVIDUAL LEVEL SENSITIVE INFORMATION CAN BE DIFFICULT FOR SOME AGENCIES THAT MAY LACK THE DATA MANAGEMENT PROTOCOLS THAT SHOULD BE IN PLACE TO PROTECT THAT DATA. LIMIT ACCESS TO IT. I'M CURRENTLY WE FOUND THAT NOT OLD. THE FOR RESOURCES TO BUILD INTERNAL SOLUTIONS TO TURN WHAT IS A VERY LARGE VERY MESSY DATA INTO THE USEFUL INFORMATION THAT TRANSPORTATION PLANNERS NEED. AND WANT FOR POLICY AND PLANNING. OF THIS KIND OF POLICY ARE SEVERAL THIRD PARTY DATA GOVERNANCE MODELS THAT FOLKS HAVE CONTEMPLATED OVER THE LAST DECADE I PURPOSELY. POPULOUS IS A PRIVATE SECTOR COMPANY DESPITE MY BACKGROUND IN THE NONPROFIT ACADEMIC AND PUBLIC SECTOR INSTITUTIONS. BECAUSE THEIR NUMBER OF KEY CONSTRAINTS THAT UNDER THESE INSTITUTIONS FROM EFFECTIVELY SOLVING THE MOBILITY DATA GAP. FIRST SECURELY STORING CLEANING A PROCESSING LARGE AMOUNTS OF GEO LOCATION DATA REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT ENGINEERING SOURCES AND VERY FEW NONPROFIT AN ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS POSSESS THEM. THAT BEING SAID IT IS CRUCIAL THAT INDEPENDENT RESEARCHERS AND EXHORTATION CONSULTANTS HAVE ACCESS TO MOBILITY DATE. ANSWER THE MANY CAR AND- OF THESE MOBILE SERVICE. LET'S HAS A NUMEROUS THE FROM ACTS TO MY DAY FOR NOT ADVOCACY. TRANSPORTATION FOR AND PERFECT PROFESSORS PER THE REQUEST OF OUR CITY CUSTOMERS AND WITH THE PERMISSION OF MOBILITY OPERATORS LET ME ILLUSTRATE A FEW DIFFERENT USE CASES AND THE REQUIRED LEVEL OF DATA GRANULARITY AND REQUIRED AND SEE- FOR THOSE SPECIFIC USE CASES TO BE FEASIBLE. AND MY WORK LET WE FIND THAT THE MAJORITY OF CITIES WERE BILLY OPERATORS TO ABIDE BY POLICIES THAT PRIMARILY IMPACT STATIONARY VEHICLES PARKED VEHICLES SUCH AS PREFERRED- RESTRICTED PARKING AREAS CAPS LIMITING THE NUMBER OF VEHICLES ON A CENTRAL IN A CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT OR PLACING A MINIMUM NUMBER OF YOU. THE EQUITIES OWNS REAL TIME AND FOR ME. VEHICLES FOR DATA VALIDATION SAYS IS SOMETHING WE WERE. HOW PACKED SPEAKING WE DO FIND THAT MOST CITIES AND FORCE THESE POLICIES ON MORE OF A MONTHLY OR QUARTERLY BASIS- THE MOBILITY DATA SPECIFICATION HASN'T BEEN PARTICULARLY WELL SUITED TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT STATIONARY VEHICLES. AS HAS BEEN RECENTLY DESCRIBED IN SOME CITY REPORTS THAT HAVE UTILIZED THESE- DATA FEEDS AND A COUPLE OF OTHER JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE UNITED STATES. SOME CITIES ENVISION A FUTURE WHERE. DATA COULD BE USED IN REAL TIME TO MORE ACTIVELY MANAGE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM FOR EXAMPLE THE REAL TIME ROUTING OR READ TIME THING OF. HOWEVER CAN. THAT THE BORDER CALL UPON AGENT HAS ON THE TRACK. SYSTEM THE MORE RISK IN LIABILITY THEY ALSO HAVE TO BE WILLING TO ASSUME. ONE EXAMPLE IN THE CONTEXT OF STUDENTS SCOOTERS THAT WE SEE TODAY IS THAT THERE ARE NUMBER OF CITIES THAT ADOPTED LOW SPEED ZONES FIRST. BY RICK OPERATORS AUTOMATICALLY READ SPEED OF THEIR VEHICLES WITHIN A SPECIFIED GEO FENCE. WITHOUT PROPER NOTICE TO WRITERS HOWEVER THIS CAN POTENTIALLY COMPOUND SAFETY ISSUES FOR EXAMPLE A WOMAN IN SANTA MONICA BADLY INJURED WHEN HER HUSBAND SCOOTER SUDDENLY ACCELERATED. UPON LEAVING ALONE IT'S OUT AND SLAMMED INTO HER LEAVING HER WITH THREE BROKEN BONES AND LIKE REQUIRING SURGERY. POLICIES THAT ARE IMPLEMENTED DIGITALLY WITHOUT PHYSICAL SIGNAGE OR COMMUNICATION TO WRITERS ABOUT AUTOMATIC WRIST. THE INCREASE ABILITY FOR IS IMPOSING. CITIES MUST HAVE AN TO MOBILITY DATA AS PUBLIC OF TRANSFER FOR. WELL PRIVATE MOBILITY COMPANIES MAY SPELLS TO SOLVE CONGESTION REDUCE TRAFFIC FATALITIES AND EXPAND EQUITABLE ACCESS TO SERVICES I BELIEVE IT IS PUBLIC AGENCIES PRIMARILY THAT HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY TO STEER PROGRESS TOWARDS THESE GOALS THE AVAILABILITY DATA HAS CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS AND I AM OPTIMISTIC WE CAN FIND WAYS OF BEING THAT AGENCIES HAVE. FULL AND KATE AT THE MOBILITY DATA. FOR THE NEW VALUES QUE WHILE ALSO ENSURING THE DATA NOT MISS USE OR EITHER INTENTIONAL OR UNINTENTIONALLY. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY ON THIS TOPIC I HAVE A NUMBER OF SITES THAT PROVIDE THE TEAM ON. THE DISPLAY INFORMATION ABOUT HOW SERVICE IS ACTUALLY VISUAL I NOODLE BY PUBLIC A- TO MANAGE PUBLIC RIGHT OF WAY. TOP TO ANSWER QUESTIONS THAT YOU. IF YOUR HOUSE SO TARA SEAVER FROM YOU EAT OF UBER. A HAD A SIX POLICIES SO WELCOME AND- YOU HAVE THE FLOOR THANK YOU CHAIRS BELL IN JACKSON MY NAME IS A TARA SEVERAL AND I LEAD PRIVACY AND SECURITY POLICY GLOBALLY BROUGH BURKE. I'M GRATEFUL TO DROP THE LEGISLATURE ON ISSUE WE ARE DEEPLY PASSIONATE ABOUT PROTECTING LOCATION DATA AND CONCERT PRIVATE PARTNERING WITH CITIES TO ACHIEVE PAUL POSITIVE POLICY COMES IN TREPIDATION. TODAY I WANT TO. FRIEND OF GOVERNMENT AGENCIES DEMANDING ACCESS TO PRECISE AN INDIVIDUAL LOCATION DATA COLLECTED BY MOBILITY COMPANIES LIKE UBER WITHOUT SEEKING A COURT ORDER OR SEARCH WARRANT AS IS REQUIRED BY STATE LAW. YOUR PATIENT DATA IS DEEPLY PERSONAL WHERE YOU LIVE WHERE YOU WORK FOR YOUR CHILDREN GO TO SCHOOL. ALL SPEAK VOLUMES ABOUT WHO YOU ARE AND WHAT YOU CARE ABOUT. SINCE JOINING UBER AND DEDICATED TO PROTECTING CONSUMER PRIVACY BY PROTECTING CONSUMER DATA. AND NOT JUST NAMES AND EMAIL ADDRESSES BUT ALSO THE PLACES ARE USERS GO AND THE PEOPLE THEY TRAVEL WITH. CITIES ARE NEGLECTING THE INHERENTLY SENSITIVE NATURE OF LOCATION DATA AND IT'S CONSUMERS WHO PAY THE PRICE. CALIFORNIA RAISE THE BAR AND PROXY PASSING THE COUNTRY'S MOST COMPREHENSIVE AND PROGRESSIVE PIPE PRIVACY LAW OVER TWO YEARS AGO. THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT SPECIFICALLY INTENDED TO PROTECT USERS FROM THE MISUSE AND RAMPANT DISTRIBUTION OF THEIR DATA ACROSS THE PRIVATE SECTOR. BUT IN PARALLEL THE REPORTS OF DATA BREACHES AT THE CITY STATE AND FEDERAL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT. THEREFORE WE CAN NO LONGER AFFORD EXCEPTIONS TO THE RULE FOR PUBLIC SECTOR ACTORS WHEN IT COMES TO PRIVACY. THE LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL ISSUED A FORMAL WRITTEN OPINION WHICH STATED THAT THE COMPELLED SHARING OF REAL TIME PRECISE GEO LOCATION DATA TO THE GOVERNMENT. REQUIRES A VALID WARRANT OR OTHER DUE PROCESS. TODAY WE ARE ASKING THE LEGISLATURE TO RE ASSERT TO THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS LAW TO PROTECTING CONSUMER PRIVACY IN THE CONTEXT OF TRANSPORTATION AND MOBILITY DATA. THIS AREA A PUBLIC POLICY HAS NOT GOTTEN ENOUGH ATTENTION DURING A TIME WHEN CONSEQUENTIAL DECISIONS ABOUT DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY ARE BEING MADE. TO VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE AND TODAY'S CONVERSATION. UBER DEEPLY BELIEVES IN THE POWER OF USING DATA IN ORDER TO IMPROVE AND INFORM PUBLIC POLICY. HELPING TO MAKE TRANSPORTATION SAFE SUSTAINABLE AND ACCESSIBLE. FOR THE MAJORITY OF POLICY OBJECTIVES SECURING HISTORICAL AN AGGREGATED DATA IS NOT ONLY SAFER THAN SHARING INDIVIDUAL LEVEL DATA IT'S ALSO MORE USEFUL. FOR EXAMPLE IF THE CITY WANTS TO INSURE UNDERSERVED AREAS HAVE EQUITABLE ACCESS TO SERVICES LIKE UBER THEY NEED TO KNOW THE RELATIVE VOLUMES OF TRIPS STARTING AND ENDING IN THOSE AREAS NOT THE REAL TIME LOCATION OF EVERY INDIVIDUAL THAT'S ON OUR PLATFORM. UBER ITSELF YOU AGGREGATED DATA TO MAKE CRITICAL BUSINESS DECISIONS. INDIVIDUAL LOCATION DATA CAN PROVE USEFUL WHEN INVESTIGATING A SAFETY INCIDENT. BUT THERE ARE LEGAL PROTOCOLS AND PROCESSES FOR SHARING THIS INFORMATION WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. WE ARE NOT TO HIDE BEHIND PRIVACY IN FACT EVERY YEAR WE PUBLISH A TRANSPARENCY REPORT ABOUT THE DATA WE SHARE. WE ARE DEEPLY INVESTED AND SHARING DATA AND WHERE POSSIBLE WE ASKED TO AGGREGATE AND ANONYMIZE DATA ESPECIALLY LOCATION DATA SO THAT CITIES CAN BE FULLY TRANSPARENT WITH THE PUBLIC AND RELEASE PROPERLY ANONYMOUS DATA WHEN THEY GET A PUBLIC RECORDS ACCESS REQUEST. HOWEVER GOVERNMENT APPETITE FOR FAR MORE PERSONAL DATA AND INTRUSIVE DATA IS GROWING. MOST RECENTLY WE WERE ASKED TO EXPOSE THE MOVEMENTS OF OUR DOCTORS BIKE AND SCOOTER USERS IN REAL TIME. NOT JUST FOR THE CITY TO USE BUT ALSO FOR THEIR THIRD PARTY CONTRACTORS TO USE AS WELL. THIS REQUIREMENT CALLED CALLED THE MOBILITY DATA SPECIFICATION OR MDS CROSSED THE LINE WE HAVE HELD AS A COMPANY SERVING MILLIONS OF USERS AROUND THE WORLD TRUSTED TO KEEP THEIR WHEREABOUTS PRIVATE. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY SAFE FROM SURVEILLANCE. THE MTS IS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW FREQUENTLY LOCATION DATA IS MIS CHARACTERIZED AS JUST TRIP DATA. ACTUALLY THE MDS REVEALS THE PRECISE GPS COORDINATES OF WHERE AND WHEN OUR WRITERS START THEIR JOURNEY. WHERE THEY END UP AND WHAT ROUTE THEY TOOK. THIS IS FOR DATA BUT IT'S ALSO PERSONAL DATA THEY ARE ONE AND THE SAME GIVING TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES ACCESS TO THE LOCATION DATA OF OUR USERS IN REAL TIME IS A CAN TO PLACING A TRACKING DEVICE IN THEIR POCKETS AND IN THIS CASE. THEY CAN'T REMOVE IT. THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE THEIR DATA IS GOING OR HOW THEIR DATA PRECISE LOCATION OF AN INDIVIDUAL WHETHER THEY'RE IN THEIR PERSONAL VEHICLE ON A BIKE ON A TROLLEY OR SIMPLY WALKING ON THE STREET IS DEEPLY PERSONAL EVEN IF SPECIFIC NAMES HAVE BEEN REMOVED. TRANSIT AND MOBILITY DATA IS ESPECIALLY SENSITIVE BECAUSE IT CAN INCLUDE AN INDIVIDUAL'S HOME AND THE LOCATIONS THEY VISIT. SUCH AS HOUSE OF WORSHIP. EMPLOYMENT LOCATIONS AND DOCTOR SUPPORT. THE NEW YORK TIMES RECENTLY REPORTED THAT DNA IS PROBABLY THE ONLY THING THAT'S HARD TO ANONYMOUS. BEEN PRECISE LOCATION INFORMATION. THESE MONUMENTAL RISKS ARE THE REASON WHY THIS LEGISLATURE ENACTED THE CALIFORNIA ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS PRIVACY ACT. THE ORGANIZATIONS PIVOTAL TO DEVELOPING THAT LAW SOME OF WHOM ARE REPRESENTED HERE TODAY HAVE BEEN ARGUING THAT THE MDS AND OTHER REAL TIME DATA SHARING STANDARDS VIOLATE THE STATUTE. MICROBIOLOGY MIGHT BE THE REASON WE'RE ALL HERE TODAY. BUT AS WE CONSIDER OTHER MODES OF POINT TO POINT TRAVEL DATA FROM A RIDE SHARING VEHICLE TO A PERSONAL VEHICLE WE FACE AN UNPRECEDENTED RISK TO USER PRIVACY THROUGH THE CONSTANT AND PERSISTENT SURVEILLANCE OF INDIVIDUALS BY THE- GOVERNMENTS. INDEED THE CPUC HAS BEEN COLLECTING PERSONAL DATA ABOUT OUR DRIVERS AND WRITERS FOR YEARS WITHOUT PRESSING THE REST VISUAL PRIVACY. WE HAVE YET TO SEE ANY ANALYSIS OR INSIGHTS FROM THE CPUC THAT EXPLAINS THE IMPACT OF TMZ'S WHICH IS WHY THEY COLLECTED IN THE FIRST PLACE. AND IF THIS IS LIKELY BECAUSE THE DATA IS TO GRANULAR AND UNWIELDY. WITHOUT ANY STANDARD METHODOLOGIES FOR USING THIS DATA IT LIES ON USED ON A SERVER SOMEWHERE AND NOW THE CPC PROPOSES TO MAKE THE STATE A PUBLIC WHICH WE ALREADY KNOW COULD BE USED BY UNSCRUPULOUS ACTORS. TO TARGET STOCK OR HARASS INDIVIDUALS. THIS IS THE UNFORTUNATE CONSEQUENCE OF MAKING PRIVACY AN AFTER THOUGHT FOR IMPORTANT AND LASTING DECISIONS. TODAY CONSUMER EXPECTATIONS OF TRANSPARENCY AND PRIVACY ARE GROWING AND THIS REPRESENTS A SHARED RESPONSIBILITY BETWEEN THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS AS DATA CONTINUES TO FLOW BETWEEN US. SMART CITY PLANNING DOES NOT HAVE TO COME AT THE EXPENSE OF CONSUMER PRIVACY AND WE ARE DEDICATED TO WORKING WITH CITIES AND OTHER MOBILITY OPERATORS TO DEVELOP SMART EFFECTIVE AND DATA RICH SOLUTIONS IN THIS SPACE. IN PARALLEL WE'RE CONFIDENT THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA CAN CONTINUE TO LEAD ON THIS ISSUE BY REAFFIRMING THE LAWS THAT GOVERN BOTH THE PRIVATE AND THE PUBLIC SECTORS USE OF PATIENT DATA THE LAWS ENACTED BY THIS VERY. WHEN BOTH ARE HELD TO THE SAME HIGH BAR OF CONSUMER PRIVACY AND PROTECTION WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT THIS DATA CAN BE SHARED SAFELY. RESPONSIBLY AND MOST IMPORTANTLY UTILIZED FOR THE BENEFIT OF OUR USERS AND YOUR CONSTITUENTS THANK YOU. THANK YOU A WILL NEXT YEAR FROM- DOUG ITO HE'S THE DIRECTOR OF. TECH BEEN ENFORCEMENT DIVISION CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. BUT AFTER CHAIR SENATE YEAH YOU'RE UP AROUND OKAY GREAT HERE. THANK YOU FOR HOSTING THIS INFORMATION IT WAS JUST YOU KNOW ACTUALLY WANTS TO STOP SO THE- WE HAVE AUDIENCE THAT ARE WATCH. HELLO THE STATE HERE SO. THAT MY BE. I'LL CHANGE THE RULE HERE AS WE GO ALONG OUR THOUGH WHICH NERO I DO ONCE IN AWHILE IN A- OKAY GO AHEAD SIR DOT YOUR THE FOR. GOOD AFTERNOON AND MEMBERS. THE OPPORTUNITY FOR LOW MULLIN LOOKS MUCH BETTER SEE. OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY- AS YOU MENTION MY NAME IS DOUG ITO I AM THE DIRECTOR OF THE CONSUMER PROTECTION AND ENFORCEMENT DIVISION AT THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. THE COMMISSION HAS JURISDICTION OVER FOR HIGHER PASSENGER CARRIERS SUCH AS LIMOUSINES AIRPORT SHUTTLES CHARTER BUS OPERATE IN TRANSPORTATION NETWORK COMPANIES LIKE UBER AND LEFT. MY COMMENTS TODAY WILL FOCUS ON DATA WE COLLECT FROM TRANSPORTATION NETWORK COMPANIES OR TNCS. AS PART OF THE COMMISSION'S OBLIGATION TO PROTECT CONSUMERS AND PROMOTE PUBLIC SAFETY WE COLLECT VARIOUS TYPES OF DATA TO AND FOR STATE LAW AND GUIDE OUR REGULATION OF THE RAPIDLY EVOLVING TNC INDUSTRY. SPECIFICALLY THERE ARE TWO COMMISSION DECISIONS THAT ARE THE BASIS FOR THE DATA SI PC COLLECTS. DECISION THIRTEEN NINE FORTY FIVE FROM TWENTY THIRTEEN. AND DECISION SIXTEEN FOR FORTY ONE FROM TWENTY SIXTEEN. THESE DECISIONS ADOPTED SPECIFIC SAFETY AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS THAT TNC IS FOLLOW AND REQUIRE TNC IS TO FILE ANNUAL REPORTS WITH THE COMMISSION. EXAMPLES OF DAY CATEGORIES IN THE ANNUAL REPORTS INCLUDE INFORMATION SPECIFIC TO TNC DRIVERS TRIP INFORMATION THAT INCLUDE SHARED OR PULLED RIGHTS. TRAFFIC INCIDENTS AND ACCIDENTS ZERO TOLERANCE COMPLAINTS INVOLVING INTOXICATING SUBSTANCES. INCIDENTS OF ASSAULT AND HARASSMENT BY PASSENGERS AND DRIVERS AND ACCESSIBILITY DATA. IN ADDITION TO THE ANNUAL REPORTS THE COMMISSION MAY ALSO COLLECT DATA FROM TEEN SEES THROUGH INDIVIDUAL REQUESTS. THE INFORMATION OBTAINED BY THE COMMISSION IS USED FOR BOTH ADVISORY AND ENFORCEMENT PURPOSES. FOR EXAMPLE IN AN ONGOING RULE MAKING OUR NINETEEN TO TWELVE THE COMMISSION IS IMPLEMENTING SENATOR HILLS TWENTY EIGHTEEN BILL SB THREE SEVENTY SIX THIRTEEN SEVENTY SIX WHICH REQUIRES THE COMMISSION TO DEVELOP PROGRAMS THAT IMPROVES TNC ACCESSIBILITY FOR PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES. USING THE ANNUAL REPORT DATA COMMISSION STAFF CALCULATED THE TIME NINETEEN SEIZE TOOK TO PICK UP PASSENGERS IN EACH CALIFORNIA COUNTY. THIS INFORMATION IS NOW BEING USED TO GUIDE COMMISSIONERS IN ASSESSING WHAT MIGHT BE REASONABLE RESPONSE TIMES FOURTEEN SEES THAT PROVIDE SERVICE USING WHEELCHAIR ACCESSIBLE VEHICLES. AS ANOTHER EXAMPLE THE ANNUAL REPORT DATA ALSO HELPS GUIDE INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AS A RESULT OF AN INVESTIGATION BASED ON HOOPER'S REPORTED ZERO TOLERANCE COMPLAIN DATA. THE COMMISSION ISSUED A SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR FINE AND REQUIRED OVER TO IMPLEMENT PROTOCOLS TO IMPROVE ZERO TOLERANCE COMPLIANCE. I WILL NOT DISCUSS THE COMMISSION'S APPROACH TO DATE ACCOUNT CONFIDENTIALITY. PURSUANT TO THE DECISION ADOPTED IN TWENTY THIRTEEN. TNC ANNUAL REPORTS ARE PRESUMED TO BE CONFIDENTIAL BY THE COMMISSION. TODAY THESE HAVE NOT BEEN SHARED WITH ANY OTHER STATE OR LOCAL AGENCY OR DISCLOSED TO THE PUBLIC. HOWEVER LAST WEEK WE RECEIVED A LETTER FROM THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD REQUESTING. TRIP LEVEL DATA CONTAINED IN THE REPORTS. CAR REQUEST IS PAR OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SENATOR SKINNER'S TWENTY EIGHTEEN BILL SB TEN FOURTEEN THE CLEAN MILE STANDARD. WE INTEND TO COMPLY WITH THE REQUEST WITHIN AN INTER AGENCY INFORMATION SHARING AGREEMENT EXECUTED BETWEEN SI PC AND CARP IN TWENTY NINETEEN. AT THE SAME TIME WE ARE ALSO AWARE OF THE INCREASING INTEREST THE PUBLIC AND LOCAL TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES HAVE IN THE AVAILABILITY OF TNC DATA. ON THIS ISSUE LAST YEAR AS PART OF AN ONGOING PRECEDING THE ASSIGNED COMMISSIONER ASKED WHETHER THE PRESUMPTION OF CONFIDENTIALITY IN THE TWENTY THIRTEEN DECISION SHOULD BE AMENDED OR REVERSED. EARLIER THIS MONTH FOLLOWING. PUBLIC AND STAKEHOLDER INPUT THESE COMMISSION ISSUE PROPOSE DECISION. IF IT IS ADOPTED FUTURE TNC ANNUAL REPORTS WILL NO LONGER BE PRESUMED TO BE CONFIDENTIAL. INSTEAD TNC WOULD BE REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH A BASIS FOR CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT BY THE COMMISSION FOR EACH PAGE SECTION OR FIELD OF DATA THAT THEY SUBMIT. THEY WILL BE ALSO BE REQUIRED TO SPECIFY THE STATUTORY BASIS FOR EACH CLAIM AND PROVIDES A PACK- FAXES SUPPORTING THEIR CLAIMS. THE COMMISSION IS CURRENTLY RECEIVING PUBLIC COMMENT ON THAT PROPOSED DECISION. AT THE STATE AGENCY THE COMMISSION TAKES RESPONSIBILITY FOR HANDLING SENSITIVE DATA VERY SERIOUSLY. WE HAVE A DUTY TO PROTECT CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION INCLUDING PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION AND CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION. IN ORDER TO MANAGE CONFIDENTIAL DATA THE COMMISSION MAINTAIN SEPARATE CYBERSECURITY ENCRYPTION AND DATA SECURITY POLICIES. THESE POLICIES ARE IMPLEMENTED COMMISSION WIDE AND ARE BASED ON A TEMPLATE PROVIDED BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY WHICH CONFORMS REQUIREMENTS FOR ALL STATE AGENCIES. IN CLOSING I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PREVENT PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSIONS ROLE IN TNC DATA COLLECTION AND USE. OF A HAPPY TO TAKE YOUR QUESTIONS DURING THE COMMENT PERIOD. THANK YOU. THANK YOU I WILL NOW TURN TO JACOB SNOW JACOB AND HE'S THE TECHNOLOGY AND CIVIL LIBERTIES ATTORNEY FROM THE AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. WELCOME THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY MY NAME IS JACOB SNOW I'M A TECHNOLOGY DELIVERS ATTORNEY AT THE ACLU OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND LIKE YOU TO TAKE THREE MESSAGES FROM MY TESTIMONY TODAY. FIRST DETAILED LOCATION INFORMATION PUTS PEOPLE AT RISK WHETHER IT'S IN THE HANDS OF PRIVATE ENTITIES OR ENHANCE THE GOVERNMENT. SECOND CITIES AND COUNTIES DESPITE. THE BEST INTENTIONS HAVE NOT PROVEN THEMSELVES TO BE GOOD STEWARDS OF PEOPLE'S MOST PRIVATE INFORMATION. AND THIRD IT IS THESE PRECISE CONCERNS THAT MOTIVATE LAWS LIKE THE CALIFORNIA ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS PRIVACY ACT AND THE CALIFORNIA BORN YOUR CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT AND THOSE LAWS SHOULD NOT BE CREE HAVE ACCEPTANCE OF THEM CREATED- WE'RE JUSTIFIED BY POSSIBLE INNOVATION IN THE MOVE MOBILITY SPACE. FOR BY THE NECESSITY OF PROVIDING AND ACCESSIBLE AND SAFE TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE. PRIVACY IS COMPATIBLE WITH INNOVATION ACCESS AND SAFETY. NDS IN JUST A WIDE VARIETY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION INCLUDING THE PROVIDERS NAME IDENTIFIER FOR THE VEHICLE OF THE VEHICLE TYPE THE TRIP PLAINTIFF AND THE VEHICLE ROUTE. OF THESE THE MOST CONCERNING IS THE PRECISE AND POTENTIALLY REAL TIME ROUTE INFORMATION- SUBMITTED THROUGH THAT SYSTEM. LOCATION INFORMATION OF THIS KIND EVEN IF IT LACKS- IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION OF A PERSON'S NAME OR OR OTHER NUMBER- TO BE DEEPLY REVEALING. AS UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT RECOGNIZED IN CARPENTER VERSES UNITED STATES TIME STAMP LOCATION INFORMATION. PROVIDES AN INTIMATE WINDOW INTO A PERSON'S PRIVATE LIFE REVEALING NOT ONLY THEIR PERSONAL- THE PARTICULAR MOVEMENTS BUT THEIR FAMILIAL. POLITICAL PROFESSIONAL RELIGIOUS AND SEXUAL ASSOCIATIONS. TODAY YOU'VE HEARD THIS DETAILED LOCATION INFORMATION CALLED PRIVATE OR NOT PERSONAL THE TRUTH IS ANONYMIZING THIS KIND OF DETAILED INFORMATION IS A POSSIBLE. IN DECEMBER THE NEW YORK TIMES RELEASED AN ANALYSIS OF LOCATION DATA IN WHICH NUMEROUS PEOPLE WERE IDENTIFIED. AND THAT WAS DONE BY KNOWING THEIR LOCATION AT ONE POINT IN TIME BUT THERE WERE A HOME ADDRESS OR WORK ADDRESS OR A PLACE WHERE THEY WERE PHOTOGRAPHED. AND THEN TAKING THAT ONE POINT. OPENING IT INTO A ROUTE TO FIND OUT. WHERE THAT PERSON RIGHT RESIDES IN THE INFORMATION. BUT ALL IT TAKES TO PICK A PERSON. OUT OF A SO CALLED ANONYMOUS STATUS AT. REDEDICATION CAN EXACERBATE PERSECUTION BUT BY AND BYPASS THE TARGETS PEOPLE AT THE FRINGES. THIS INCLUDES POLICE ENCOUNTERS IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT ALMOST A SWEEPS OR PROBATION CONDITIONS TO NAME A FEW. FOR THIS UNFORTUNATELY IS NOT HYPOTHETICAL WE'VE ALREADY SEEN FEDERAL IMMIGRATION AUTHORITIES USING LOCATION INFORMATION FROM LICENSE PLATE CAMERAS TO TRACK PEOPLE FIND THEM AND TARGET THEM FOR DEPORTATION. IMAGINE HOW THE DETAILED REAL TIME LOCATION INFORMATION OF EVERYONE LEAVING A MOSQUE WOULD AFFECT WRITERS IN THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY. THESE CONSIDERATIONS MUST BE ADDRESSED AT THE OUTSET. BUILDING PRIVACY IN FROM THE BEGINNING MEANS ARTICULATING A COMPELLING NEED FOR INFORMATION FOR SELECTED LIMITING COLLECTION RETENTION AND USE SOLELY TO WHAT IS NECESSARY. THESE KINDS PROTECTIONS- HAVE NOT BEEN INCORPORATED AND THE NDS SPECIFICALLY DOESN'T INCLUDE PROTECTIONS APPROPRIATE TO THE GRAVE PRIVACY RISKS POSED BY THIS INFORMATION. EVEN IF BETTER POLICIES EXISTED COMPLIANCE IS NOT A SHORT. I REFER THE COMMITTEE TO THE RECENT REPORT FROM THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR REGARDING LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT USE OF AUTOMATED LICENSE PLATE READERS BUT REPORT REFLECTS POORLY ON LAUNCH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ABILITY TO PROTECT PEOPLE'S PRIVACY AS LOCATION INFORMATION IS COLLECTED. AND STORED THE LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT FOR EXAMPLE HAS NO POLICY AT ALL DESPITE THE FACT THATHAVING A POLICIES REQUIRED BY LAW. PRIVACY LIMITS WERE RESPECTED IN A HOPE YOUR LOCATION WAS PART RISK. THESE TROUBLING RESULTS SHOULD BE THE TOP OF MIND AS THE COMMITTEES REFLECT ON WERE EXTENSIVE COLLECTION LOCATION INFORMATION. IT'S FOR THESE REASONS BUT CAL AQABA IMPOSES STRICT LIMITS WHEN THE GOVERNMENT CAN FORCE ACCESS TO INFORMATION. FROM SERVICE PROVIDERS AND FROM THE VOICES. CALIPERS Y. APPLIES EXPLICITLY TO CITIES AND SUBDIVISIONS A MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT IN THE GOAL THE STATUTE. IS TO EXPAND PRIVACY PROTECTIONS BEYOND THAT WHICH ARE AVAILABLE. UNDER FEDERAL STATUTORY OR CONSTITUTIONAL LAW. THE KIND OF SHARING THE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE ALSO FRUSTRATES CONSUMER EXPECTATIONS IN LIGHT OF THE CAN SCALP FOR THE CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT. PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT TO REQUEST DELETION OF THEIR- WRITING DATA. CONSUMERS MIGHT DO THAT ARE SOME OF THE CONCERNS I'VE TALKED ABOUT TODAY. CONCERNS THEIR INFORMATION WOULD BE MISUSED SHARED OR SOLD IN WAYS THEY DON'T AGREE WITH. THE COMMISSION IS ALREADY BEEN SHARED WITH CITIES OR THIRD PARTIES THOSE DELETION RIGHTS UNDER THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT OF LOST THEIR RELATIVES WITH. IF YOU FEEL YOU'VE CALIFORNIA OPPOSE THE COLLECTION OF SENSE OF INFORMATION ABOUT INDIVIDUALS. UNTIL REVISIONS ARE MADE TO PROTECT CIVIL AND PRIVACY RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS WILL BE IMPACTED BY THAT COLLECTION. MY LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR QUESTIONS. HEY HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE QUESTIONS ARE NO SIR DONALD A- OTHERS- ONE OVER HERE ONE OVER HERE- WE HAVE THREE MEMBERS MAYBE SOME MORE SIR JACKSON MYSELF OF ALL START OFF WITH THE QUESTION. IN TERMS OF. CAN RESEARCH BE DONE WITH AGGREGATED DATA DOCTOR GIULIANO IS THAT. GIVE IT GIVE A PERSPECTIVE ABOUT. THE WORK I'VE DONE OVER FORTY YEARS ON TRANSPORTATION PLANNING IN IN TRYING TO GET MOR PEOPLE TO WRITE TRANSIT TRYING TO DEVISE THE MOST EFFICIENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM TRY TO DEALING WITH LAND USE TRANSPORTATION ISSUES. AIR POLLUTION AND TRYING TO REDUCE AIR POLLUTION. OUR TOP WITH ALL THE FEDERAL MANDATES THAT WE HAVE YOU KNOW AND THE CHANGING SOCIETY A CULTURAL. OF OTHER NEEDS. OF CAN YOU CAN WE. IN A WORLD GET MORE COMPLICATED AS WE GO ALONG AND YOU KNOW WE'LL WE'LL KNOW THAT. UNDER HAN PRIVACY PROTECTION IS. PEOPLE FEEL IS GETTING WORSE NOT BETTER. I WOULD SAY. OKAY THIS IS THE FACT ELECTION. OF SO HOW DO WE DO THE GOOD THINGS W NEED TO DO TO MAKE OUR CITIES BEAUTIFUL PLACES TO LIVE. AT THE SAME TIME. PROTECT THE PRIVACY PEOPLE OF. IN IN TERMS OF THE RESEARCH THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO TO MAKE OR THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE TO LIVE THANKS AND THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE DOING. SO MAYBE SOME OF THE OTHER PANELISTS CAN COMMENT ALSO MINOR QUESTION IS A MINOR QUESTION BUT I THINK IT'S A NO IT'S A PUBLIC POLICY QUESTION I MEAN I ALSO WANT TO THROW IN THIS THERE'S A LOT OF FEDERAL MANDATES THEY TELL US TO DEUCE YEAH WE HAVE ALL THE YOU KNOW WE HAVE A CIVIL RIGHTS MANDATES. WE ARE THERE FOR. MANDATES THE ENVIRONMENTAL MANDATES. WE HAVE THE AMERICAN DISABILITIES ACT MANDATES. WE HAVE CONDITIONS THAT THEY IMPOSE US ON EVERY SINGLE NICKEL OF ANY KIND OF FEDERAL MONEY WE GET FROM. YELLOW SO YOU HAVE TO DO THE SYSTEM THIS SHIP TO FILE THIS REPORT YOU HAVE TO DO A SEQUEL YOU HAVE TO DO. NEED ALL THIS STUFF OKAY SO TO GET THE MONEY TO BUILD THE TRANSIT SYSTEMS TO BUILD VARIOUS THINGS. SO MAYBE MAYBE THAT WOULD BE THE QUESTION FOR EVERYBODY. OKAY I'LL I'LL START OFF- AND LET'S TALK ABOUT KIND OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT WE CAN DO WITH AGGREGATE AND DISAGGREGATED DATA YEAH THAT'S AND IF YOU'RE BEGINNING POINT PLEASE- AND LET'S USE THE EXAMPLE OF TRANSIT- BECAUSE I THINK- THAT SOMETHING THAT WE ALL ARE FAMILIAR WITH- AND DETERMINE. WE CAN WE CAN LEARN A LOT FROM. THE AGGREGATE BEHAVIORS LET'S SAY THE BOARDINGS AT ALIGHTINGS AT TRANSIT STOPS AND WE CAN LEARN A LOT ABOUT DEMAND ON A TRANSIT pSAID ALIGHTINGS ON THOSE STOPS FOR EXAMPLE WE DON'T HAVE. BUT THAT'S ALL WE CAN DO WITH THAT DATA WE DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA OF. WHAT THE COLLECTION OF PEOPLE TOGETHER ACTUALLY WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE COLLECTION OF PEOPLE TOGETHER SO WITH THEREFORE DON'T KNOWS THAT IF WE WERE TO MAKE A CHANGE HOW THAT CHANGE MIGHT- HAVE WHAT KIND OF REACTION THERE MIGHT BE TO A CHANGE IN SERVICE BECAUSE WE DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE ENOUGH AND INFORMATION ABOUT PEOPLE'S PARTICULAR PREFERENCE SO IF WE HAVE SOME INFORMATION ON INTERVIEWS OF PEOPLE OVER ON THE REAL ACTIVITIES EACH PERSON IS DOING IN TERMS OF THEIR TRAVEL BEHAVIOR WHICH IS WHAT WE DO IN TRAVEL DIARIES THAN HAVE DONE- THAT YOU CAN LOOK AT HOW THAT DATA ARE HOW THOSE IN THE TOOLS AND THE- CHARACTERISTICS. REACT. TO THREE ARE TO REALIZE BILLET THE REVISED TO SERVE CALL AND SO. AND FROM THAT INFORMATION WE CAN THEN BUILD UP THE MODELS THAT WE NEED TO PREDICT ON A MORE AGGREGATE BASIS ACT SO WITH THE BOTTOM OF THIS WE ALWAYS NEED TO HAVE SOME INFORMATION ABOUT. ABOUT THE INDIVIDUALS THANKS- I THINK I WOULD WHAT I'D LIKE TO MAKE A POINT ABOUT REAL TIME VERSUS NOT REAL TIME DATA- WHEN WE'RE DOING RESEARCH WE'RE DOING RESEARCH ON HISTORICAL DATA- WE'RE NOT. GENERALLY IN THIS TYPE OF RESEARCH WE'RE NOT GOING OUT TO WATCH PEOPLE WHAT THEY'RE DOING AT THE AT THE MOMENT. WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS LOOK AT X. POST- WHAT IS THAT BEHAVIOR SO THAT WE CAN UNDERSTAND. SO FOR US HISTORICAL DATA IS ACTUALLY MORE WORTHWHILE THAN REAL TIME DATA. NOW YOU HAD A SECOND PART OF YOUR QUESTION JULY JUST- I THINK. OKAY GIVE YOU ANOTHER EXAMPLE OKAY I AM. I PERPLEXED BY OF THE AIR POLLUTION IN THE MONEY CENTRAL CITY SO THE SAN FRANCISCO OKAY SO THEY WANT ME TO PROVE CONGESTION PRICING MECHANISM AS ALTERNATIVE WELL SECOND WORK CAMINO AYE AYE AYE WHO ARE WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE THEY'RE CAUSING ALL THE CONGESTION WHERE THE COMING FROM- WHAT'S WHAT YOU KNOW IT'S A LOT POLLUTION AND I'VE BEEN TOLD BY THE FROM GOVERNMENT. RID OF THIS POLLUTION. OF I'M GOING TO GET PENALIZED IF I DON'T GET A REAL GONNA HAVE SOME CORPS WERE SOMETHING THIS IS A HAVE TO GIVE OF THE PULL. BUT I DON'T WANT TO IMPOSE ON PEOPLE'S. PRIVATE INFORMATION SO WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS ON AT THE READER THAT'S THAT'S AN EXIT IS THE- IS THE- SAN FRANCISCO ACTUALLY CONDUCTS THEIR OWN TRAVEL SERVICE YEAH- AND THEN THEY GET INFORMATION- WELL WHERE PEOPLE ARE COMING FROM AND WHERE THEY'RE GOING ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. AND THEN THEY AGGREGATED UP BE ABLE TO SAY WELL THIS IS WHERE THE DEMAND IS. THEY ALSO NEED THAT INFORMATION TO KNOW PEOPLE'S PRICE SENSITIVITY TO YOUR QUESTION ABOUT HIS CONGESTION PRICING GOING TO WORK THAT'S A QUESTION OF PEOPLE'S PRICE SENSITIVITY SO WE NEED TO KNOW THAT IN ADVANCE OR WE COULD PRICE TOO HIGH A PRICE TO LOW WE CAN HAVE ALL KINDS OF. CONSEQUENCE AS A RESULT. I ALSO WANT TO COME DOCTOR COOLEY SHE STUDY THIS. YES THANK YOU OR FROM A RESEARCH HAS GOING I DO I LIVE IN FEAR SCOTT AND WAS BORED IN SECOND SO A COUPLE I ACT OF KEY POINTS I'D LIKE TO MAKE AS A FORMER RESEARCHER I THINK THAT IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE FIRST DIFFERENT LEVELS OF AGGREGATION SO IT'S NOT A BINARY ISSUE OF ACT. ZIG DISSECTOR GET- VARIOUS LEVELS OF RADIATION AND QUEEN THAT ARE VERY YOU BOTH FOR TRANSPORTATION RESEARCHERS- AND THEN THE SECOND POINT IS THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT SERVE DISAGGREGATED DATA I. A TRANSPORTATION RESEARCHER THAT SPECIFICALLY DID TRAVEL DEMAND MODELING SO FORECASTING THE FUTURE OF PROBABLE USING TRAVEL. RAISING INDEED DIE WHICH WERE OBTAINED WITH CONSENT OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND OFTEN WITH THE CONSENT OF A SMALL SAMPLE OF THE VISUAL THAT. INSTALL AN APP WHEN THERE'S SO AND I WAS TRACK THEM. REST PER. OF YOU IT FOR TRANSPORTATION PLANNING THIS OVER COURSE OF TIME THAT I BEEN A TRANCE. RE IT'S ACTUALLY BECOME INCREASE COMMON FOR OF TRAVEL DEMAND MODELERS TO PURCHASE THE TYPE OF DATA THAT NOW IS INCREASINGLY SEEING A LOT OF SCRUTINY SO CELLPHONE RACE DATA CAN TRACK UP TO TWELVE. MILLION PLUS AMERICANS SOME COMPANIES CLAIM TO BE ABLE TO SEE ALL THE CELL PHONE DATA OF TEN PERCENT. OF THE CANS- IS VERY VALUABLE DATA FOR TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH HOWEVER I WILL SAY THAT IT ALSO STILL DOESN'T ANSWER A LOT OF THE BASIC QUESTION. BETTER IMPORTANT TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH- WHAT I PRODUCED A STUDY LOOKING AT. THE MODE SUBSTITUTION UBER AND LEFT AND THEN ALL SUBSEQUENTLY THE MODES STATE USED FOR MICROBIOLOGY. THE WAY TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION IS TO WE ASK PEOPLE. PAPER OR ON BOARD. WHAT ESTRACE DATA THAT TRACK THE MOVEMENT OF THEIR TRIP SO I THINK IT'S VERY TO ME THE YOU CASE TO THE KEY RE QUESTION AND THE TYPE OF DATA THAT'S BEEN COLLECTED FOR THAT PURPOSE AND THEN A FINAL POINT THAT'LL MAKE IS I SERVE ON- DIFFERENT STANDING COMMITTEES OF THE TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH BOARD OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMIES I WAS JUST AT A CONFERENCE IN WASHINGTON DC THEIR ANNUAL MEETING WHERE BIKESHARE RESEARCHERS WERE PRESENTING WORK. ON AND- ANALYSIS KEY RESEARCH QUESTIONS RELATED TO MICROBIOLOGY THEY SPENT PROBABLY SOMEWHERE ON THE ORDER OF TWELVE MONTHS COLLECTING HARVESTING AND CLEAN DATA SOURCES THAT ARE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE TO PRODUCE ANALYSIS IS THE AUTOMATED ON A PLATFORM THAT CAN BE USED SENATE MINUTES I THINK COLLEGES INCREASE THE THERE IS MORE ABOUT THE PRIVATE SECTOR THAT ISN'T BEING MADE AVAILABLE TO RESEARCHERS AND THAT'S A PROBLEM THAT WE WANT TO SOLVE AT POPULOUS AND THERE IS TO GET THE DATA SO THAT RESEARCH. ACT TO KEEP A CHAT PUT UPON A ROAD OR GESTURE THING DOES THE GET YOU TO THE GOAL THANK YOU AIMED TO STRIVE FOR IN A MATTER OF MY. SO THAT IS NECESSARY TO DO GOOD PLANNING SO YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY BUT. WE GOT SOME BIG PROBLEMS WE HAVE A TRANSIT RIDERSHIP GOING DOWN. AND WE DON'T WE DON'T KNOW HOW YOU KNOW WE ARE THE GLOBAL WARMING CRISIS SOME PEOPLE WANT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. SO WE GOT OF REALLY GOOD INFORMATION TO. TOGETHER BUT ON THE OTHER HAND. OUR IS OUR INFORMATION THERE WERE NOT A REALLY EVEN LOOKING AT RIGHT NOW THAT'S AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW. IS THERE INFORMATION THAT WE COULD USE RIGHT NOW THAT'S JUST THERE THERE WERE NOT USING TO MAKE THESE DETERMINATION I WENT TO THE I SIT ON- VISOR COMMITTEE OF THE- UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA- TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE. AND WE HAD OUR MEETING LAST LAST WEEK. AND THEY ASKED ME WHAT DO YOU THINK THE MOST SO I SAID WE GOTTA START WE GOT TO DO WITH THIS CLIMATE CHANGE THING AND YOU GUYS HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHY WE'RE HAVING A DROP IN TRANSIT RIDERSHIP. AND WE NEED IT NOW WE CAN'T WE UP WE HAVE TO DO RESEARCH. SO. THERE'S PRESSING ISSUES IS WHAT I'M SAYING SO TO CONNECT FOR A YES SIR JACKSON WE HEARD BRIAN DAHLE THE WE HAVE- CENTER RUBIO AND CENTER DRAWS ON ON THIS YEAR- SKINNER AND ON THIS ISSUE SO I THINK WE'RE ALL IN AGREEMENT THAT WE NEED TO ADD A TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING ON THE QUESTION IS WHAT DATA DO WE NEED. BECAUSE THERE IS SO MUCH DATA THAT WE COULD COLLECT AND FRANKLY I THINK IS BEING COLLECTED THAT ISN'T. NECESSARILY NECESSARY TO MAKE A DETERMINATION OF WHY ARE WE HAVING THE ISSUES THAT WE'RE HAVING. BUT THE ABILITY TO COLLECT DATA AND TO GET AS GRANULAR AS KNOWING WHAT TIME IN THE MORNING A PERSON LEAVES. TO GO TO WORK IF THEY MAKE STOPS ON THE WAY IF THEY MAKE STOPS ON THE WAY BACK OR IF THEY MEET PEOPLE IN. THANKS TO TRULY ARE ALMOST VOYEURISTIC. SO I GUESS MY QUESTION IS TO MISS- SIVARAMAN I DO WANT TO SAY I FIND IT REALLY INTERESTING APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERN ABOUT THE PUBLIC SECTOR- PERHAPS THIS IS A TURN OF EVENTS FOR UBER WHICH IS NOT NECESSARILY BEEN. THE BEST STEWARD AND THE MOST RESPONSIBLE- COLLECTOR OF INFORMATION OR COMPANY BUT I'M I'M DELIGHTED THAT DID IF AT LEAST FROM THE SOUNDS OF IT THERE'S BEEN A- A TURN AROUND AS FAR AS- RECOGNIZING. THAT WHAT IS AND IS NOT APPROPRIATE- AND ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO REGULATION SO PART OF WHAT I THINK WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE. IS TO CREATE SOME REGULATION THAT WILL GIVE US INFORMATION THAT'S NEEDED WHICH WILL ALSO AT THE SAME TIME TELL PEOPLE THAT THIS INFORMATION IS BEING COLLECTED ABOUT THEM MOST PEOPLE GET ON A SCOOTER AND THEY THINK THEY'RE TRUST TAKEN. SOMEWHERE AND THAT'S THE END OF IT BUT IN FACT ALL SORTS OF PERSONAL DATA IS BEING COLLECTED AND THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW IT. SO IF YOU DO A SURVEY YOU ASKED PEOPLE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING THEY WILL PARTICIPATE IF THEY KNOW AND IF THEY ARE OKAY WITH THAT. NOW WERE ESSENTIALLY SERVING PEOPLE AND SURVEILLING THEM AT THE SAME TIME SO. DO YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS BASED UPON. MISTER SNOW'S COMMENT WHICH I THREE TWO WEEKS WE SHOULD WE NEED TO NARAL WHAT IT IS WE'RE LOOKING FOR. AND WE NEED TO GET PERMISSION OR AT LEAST GIVE PEOPLE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE AWARE OF THIS AND MAKE CHOICE WITH A ONE. INFORMATION IN. THIS GROUP DID ARE BEFORE WE GO AHEAD AND DO IT SO ANY THOUGHTS ON THAT. DO YOU AGREE DISAGREE WITH HOW DO WE GET TO WHAT WE NEED TO DO FOR POLICY WILL AT THE SAME TIME BALANCING THE PRIVACY RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS INFORMATION WE'RE TAKING. ABSOLUTELY AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE QUESTION- I THINK THAT- THE QUESTION OF WHAT GOALS WE ARE TRYING TO SOLVE AND WHAT WHAT PROBLEMS WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE CONCRETELY THAT'S HAT WE EED TO DETERMINE FIRST BECAUSE FROM THERE WE CAN DETERMINE WHAT DATA IS APPROPRIATE. ACTUALLY SOLVING THOSE GOALS NOW THERE ARE SOME GOALS- THAT CAN USE AGGREGATED DATA AND DOCTOR GIULIANI ROUTE WOULD BE ON A ROCK RAN THROUGH SOME OF THOSE BUT THERE ARE SOME THAT WILL REQUIRE DISAGGREGATED DATA AND WHEN IT COMES TO THOSE IT'S RICK IT'S ABSOLUTELY IMPORTANT. THAT WOULD ALLOW USERS TO OPT OUT OF THEIR PERSONAL DATA IF THEY SO CHOOSE RIGHT AN EXAMPLE THAT I TYPICALLY GIVES YOU ACTUALLY TO SHARE YOUR TIME LOCATE AND I IN ORDER. OVER YOU CAN ACROSS STREET IF YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE YOU'RE COMFORTABLE SHARING YOUR REAL TIME. WITH YOU CAN CROSS AND SEND A ARE. I'M USE TO OPT OUT OF SHARE THEIR LOOK DATA WHETHER IT'S FOR PER ENTITY OR A PUBLIC ENTITY IS ABSOLUTELY KEY AND MORE BROADLY SPEAKING GIVING USERS MORE CONTROL OVER WHAT DATA THEY CHOOSE TO SHARE AGAIN WITH ANY ENTITY AND THE PUBLIC SECTOR AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR THE NONPROFIT SPACE IS ABSOLUTELY KEY AND SO AGAIN FIGURING OUT THE USE CASES FOR SOLVING THE CRITICAL GOALS MANY OF WHICH ARE SENATOR BELL REFERENCED FIGURING OUT CONCRETE USE CASES AND WORKING BACKWARDS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IT AS REQUIRED FOR THOSE USE CASES IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL AND GIVING USED TOYS AND BOOKS ABILITY. IS ALSO CRITICAL. THE SERVER JACKSON FINISHED- YES JUST WANTED COMMISSIONER SANTIAGO OVERCOME AS WELL- YOU KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN SOME COMMENT ABOUT THE USEFULNESS OF SURVEY DATA- I THINK SUPPORT TO DRAW A DISTINCTION BETWEEN DISAGGREGATED INFORMATION FROM A SURVEY WHERE- IT'S COLLECTED FROM PARTICULAR INDIVIDUALS WHO'VE DECIDED TO PUT IN A SURVEY IN DISAGGREGATED INFORMATION THAT'S COLLECTED FROM LITERALLY EVERY SINGLE PERSON WHO MIGHT MAKE USE OF A PRODUCT- THE THIS DISAGGREGATED INFORMATION- PARTICULARIZED- IT INDIVIDUAL INFORMATION SHOULD NOT BE COLLECTED- IN A AND A DRAGNET WAY OR WAY WHICH- INCLUDES EVERY SINGLE PERSON- AND TO KNOW A FOR ITS FOR THE CONSENT OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE PARTICIPATING. BUT AS OF. CENTER DOLLY. THANK YOU CO CHAIR SO I AM SUPER EXCITED TO BE IN THIS HEARING I HAVE. TWO QUESTIONS MAYBE A THIRD ONE BUT MY FIRST ONE IS HOW DOES THE- LA DOT USE REAL TIME LOCATION DATA. WHEN A DEVICE ON A RIDER IS ON A TRIP. SO THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION WE DON'T GET THE ROUTE DATA UNTIL TWENTY FOUR HOURS AFTER THE TRIP IS DONE. SO WHEN YOU'RE ACTUALLY ON THE SCOOTER- THE PIECE OF INFORMATION THAT WE MAY HAVE WHILE YOU'RE ON THE RIDE IS WHERE THE RIDE BEGAN. AND THAT'S IT AND THE WAY THAT WE USE THAT I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE- IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF VENICE WHICH WAS AN INCREDIBLY ATTRACTIVE NEIGHBORHOOD FOR A LOT OF SCOOTER COMPANIES TO DEPLOY ITS NEAR THEIR HEADQUARTERS. HIGHLY COMPETITIVE MARKET EVERYBODY'S TRYING TO GET MARKET. WE HAD ABOUT THREE THOUSAND VEHICLES DEPLOYED IN ABOUT A ONE SQUARE MILE AREA WHICH IS AN OVERSATURATION SO WE HAD OUR STAFF GO OUT AND ACTUALLY MEASURE HOW MUCH HIDE WALK AREA IS ACTUALLY AVAILABLE FOR THE SAFE STORAGE OF THESE THINGS. OUT OF THE SENSIBLE RIGHT BY. THE BILL. FOR OLDER FOR FOLKS ARE USING THIS. AND WE HAVE VERY RULES ABOUT HOW MANY SCOOTERS EACH COMPANY CAN DEPLOY BY A SPECIFIC TIME EVERY DAY. SO WE HAVE TO GO OUT THERE AND SPOT CHECK THAT BUT WE'RE ABLE AND WHEN WE VERIFY THE DATA IS LEGITIMATE AND WE SEE THE DIPLOMA ENDS AND THE NOTIFICATIONS ARE HAPPENING. THEN WE CAN THAT FROM DOWNTOWN AND WE CAN TELL COMPANIES. YOU WERE ALLOWED TO DEPLOY FIVE SCOOTERS ON THIS CORNER AT NINE AM NOT SIX NOT SEVEN BUT FIVE. AND YOU WERE COMPLAIN THAT REGULATION AND SO NOW YOU HAVE A TWENTY FOUR HOUR. HOLD BILLETED TO BE IN THE VENICE AREA AT ALL. SO I KIND OF INFORMATION AND BEING ABLE TO GO OUT WHEN I HAVE A VERY SMALL TEAM TO HAVE. AN EDGE TO BE EIGHT THOUSAND SCOOTERS THAT CAN GO OUT. THE GET ON A VEHICLE. AND I CAN SEE IN REAL TIME DID THE COMPANY SEND AND BECAME AS THE- THEY WERE. AND A THEY DO. WHEN WE TRY ALL OF THE DATA THAT HAVE FOR THEM. SO IT IF IT'S REAL TIME IN ONLY DOING IT. YOU'RE NOT DOING IT I'M- IT IT'S- GETTING THE MEASURE FOR MEASURE AFTER THE RIGHT. ON THE ROUTE THE ROUTE ITSELF SO I DON'T KNOW. IF YOU PICKED UP A SCHOOL AT ONE LOOK. IN DROPPED OFFPOR EL I DON'T KNOW WHY ROUTE TOOK IN THE- OR IF STOP. UNTIL OUR YOU OFF VEHICLE SO WHEN THE WHEN THE VEHICLES PARKED YOU KNOW THIS PARK THERE THAN ANY OF YOU CAN YOU CAN MONITOR THAT AS WELL THAT'S RIGHT SO WE HAD FOR EXAMPLE- A COUPLE OF EMERGENCIES WHERE WE NEEDED TO LET COMPANIES KNOW. HEY WE GOT A FIRE HAPPENING WE NEED WE NEED TO MAKE THAT YOU AS WELL ARE YOU HERE ARE EVACUATION ROUTES- CAN SKI IF THERE ARE. OTHER CLEAR FOR FIRST RESPONDERS AND ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS THEY ALSO HAVE CAPS ON THE NUMBER OF VEHICLES THAT ALLOWED TO HAPPEN SPECIFIC NEIGHBORHOODS- AND SO WE'RE ABLE TO SEE ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS. ARE THERE A- TO POINT WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO AND THEY PAYING US THE- THE FEE FOR THAT. OR ARE THEY NOT. I THINK THAT'S THAT'S THOSE ARE SOME OF THE EXAMPLES ARE. USE CASE IS IT. THIS TO ME SURE THE COME. ARE HONEST WITH US ABOUT THE DATA THEY'RE PROVIDING. RIGHT BUT YOU KNOW THE START AND THE STOP TIME SO THAT'S THE YOU CAN TELL WE'RE SOMEBODY'S GOING THEN. BUT BY THAT DATE IT CRACKED. WELL I CAN TELL WHERE A SCOOTER START WHERE SCOOTER STRIP THAT UNLOCKED AND WE'RE SCOOTER GOT RE LOCKED THAT'S RIGHT. SO WORD REAL QUICK I HAVE JUST A COUPLE MORE ONE AS THE POPULOUS FOLKS FROM. DR COOLER. YES SO DO YOU DO YOU GET DOES LAW ENFORCEMENT ASK YOU FOR INFORMATION. ARE WE HAVE NEVER HAD LAW ENFORCEMENT ASK US DIRECTLY FOR INFORMATION BUT WE ARE AWARE OF AT LEAST TWO CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE CITIES THAT WERE OUR CUSTOMERS WERE ASKED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT FOR SPECIFIC TRIP INFORMATION. INCLUDING CALIFORNIA. OKAY BECAUSE I HEARD- THE PERSON FROM UBER SAY THAT THAT'S PRIVATE INFORMATION IT NEEDS TO BE DONE BY SUBPOENA. SO I AM VERY MUCH INTERESTED IN THIS AREA ACTUALLY I'M DOING A BILL THIS YEAR BECAUSE THE DMV'S ACTUALLY SELLING OUR INFORMATION. AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT- MOST OF CALIFORNIANS WOULD AGREE WITH- AND THEY'RE DOING IT WITHOUT A SUBPOENA THEY'RE SELLING MY DRIVER'S LICENSE WHAT KIND OF VEHICLE I HAVE. AND SO I HAVE A BILL ON THAT SO MY LAST QUESTION AND THEN I TAKE THE CHAIRS FOR THIS COMMITTEE I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT CALIFORNIA'S NEED TO BE WEIGHING IN HEAVILY ON ABOUT. OUR RIVER. AND THE GETS. WORK ON DRONE TOGETHER ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE MONITORING- US WITH THEIR DRONES AND TAKING PICTURES IN OUR BACKYARDS. FOR THE P. C. R. C. P. YOU SEE. IN IN YOUR RECENT OF PROPOSED RULEMAKING YOU STATED THAT THE INTENT OF RELEASING INDIVIDUAL DRIVER INFORMATION INCLUDING NAMES AND LICENSE PLATES. DO YOU BELIEVE THE DRIVER- PRIVACY FROM THE PUBLIC KNOWING THEIR WORK HABITS OR RIGHTS- TRAVEL PATTERNS. YES ABSOLUTELY- THE COMMISSION DOES BELIEVE IN THE PRIVACY OF THE INDIVIDUAL I THINK THE QUESTIONS THAT ARE BEING RAISED IN THIS HEARING ARE ABSOLUTELY PERTINENT. THE PROPOSED DECISION- DOES ALLOW FOR THE RELEASE OF INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE ANNUAL REPORT HOWEVER WE STILL DO HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY WITH RESPECT TO THE PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE FROM DIRECT AND IT PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION. AND THE C. B. EITHER THE CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION. THANK YOU. IF I MAY- YEAH GO RIGHT AHEAD LIBRARIES ON THE LAWN FORCING QUESTION I DO THINK THAT ONE OF THE KEY VALUES BECAUSE ONE OF THE KEY CHALLENGES THAT I SAW WITH MANY PUBLIC AGENCIES THAT WERE- SEEKING TO OBTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT UBER AND LIFT RIDES THROUGH PARTNERSHIPS THAT WERE LARGELY FUNDED BY THE FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION WISE KALENJIN WITH OPEN RECORDS REQUESTS FROM THE PUBLIC MEDIA GENERAL PUBLIC COMPETITOR. AND THEN ALSO THE ISSUE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT- ONE PERSON FALLS WITHIN I THINK A SPECIAL CATEGORY AND ONE OF THE KEY CHALLENGES WE SEEN IS THAT IN MANY CIRCUMSTANCES OUR CUSTOMER IS THE CITIES SO THE CITY OF WHICH I ALSO CAN IN THE DEPARTMENT- UNFORCED AND- GOLD. THOSE REQUESTS BEEN IN A- REQUEST. WE HAVE SEEN IN RICK. FROM LAW. WELL THERE WAS ACTUALLY A CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE THERE WAS A HOMICIDE IN A CITY WHERE. APPARENTLY TO SCORE TWO YEARS WERE SEEN AT THE SCENE OF THE CRIME AND WERE THOUGHT TO BE THE GETAWAY VEHICLES. ARE ACTIVE THEN ASKED THE BIKES YOUR PLANNER SO IN OUR CIRCUMSTANCE BECAUSE WERE HANDLING LOTS A LOT OF SCOOTER AND DATA IT'S ACTUALLY THE NEXT YEAR PLANNER THAT'S BEING ASKED BY LAW ENFORCED. AND FROM WHAT WE CAN TELL MIKE SURE PLANNERS DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE A LOT OF TRAINING AND HOW TO DEAL WITH THESE PARTICULAR TYPES OF REQUIRE. AND I THINK THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE KNOW THAT IT'S OBVIOUS THAT NAMES SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER IS. IT DRESS PERSON STATION I THINK IF YOU'RE WHO BACK THE SENSITIVE NATURE OF TO LOOK DATA AND SO IT IS A CHAO SUCH FOR THAT REASON WE ARE OF A NUMBER OF INDUSTRY AND CITY ORGANIZED GROUPS TO HELP DEVELOP BEST PRACTICES AROUND HOW TO DEAL WITH THESE TYPES OF REQUESTS. TO MON APOLOGIZE FOR AGNES WAS I REALLY DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU ARE YOU YOU ARE A PRIVATE OR YOUR NONPROFIT OR WHAT WHAT ARE YOU ARE YOU PUBLIC AGENCY BUT WHAT DO YOU DO WE ARE PRIVATE COMPANY OUR CUSTOMERS. ARE CITIES. SO HOW CAN THE PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST CAN'T COME TO YOU FOR YOUR PRIVATE COMPANY YOU DO YOU. WOULD HAVE TO HAVE A SUBPOENA FOR THAT INFORMATION CORRECT- WITH THE CASE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. WHICH HAVE BEEN LARGELY INTERNAL REQUESTS TO OUR CITY CUSTOMERS THE CITY CUSTOMERS THAT WE WORK WITHIN BOTH OF THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES DID NOT ACTUALLY HAVE THE DISAGGREGATED ROCKCHIP INFORMATION WE DID. AND WE ARE NOT AN INTERNAL REQUEST. AND SO WE'VE CREATED ESSENTIALLY A BUFFER FOR THE CITY THEN TO MORE EASILY RESPOND TO THAT REQUEST BECAUSE THEY NEVER HAD THE RAW DISAGREED INFORMATION TO BEGIN WITH OKAY LAST QUESTION AND- ARE YOU. DO YOU HAVE THE AVAILABILITY TO BE ABLE TO SELL YOUR THE INFORMATION YOU GATHER WE DO NOT. HAVE THE INFORMATION WE GATHER AND WE AGREED YOU. BECAUSE WITH OUR CITY COUNCIL AND ALSO WITH BILLY I. THAT THAT IS ONLY USED FOR THE PURPOSES OF TRANSPORTATION PLANNING AND WEALTHY THANK YOU. JUST HAD A QUESTION FOR MYSTERY. THERE WERE A- STATE MADE SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT I THINK- QUALITY. DR CLEVELAND ABOUT THE THREE APPROACHES AND HOW THE CITY'S. IT'S THE IT'S BETTER TO HAVE A THIRD PARTY THIS IS WHAT I UNDERSTOOD TO HAVE A THIRD PARTY RATHER THAN A CITY DIRECTLY GET INVOLVED AND GET THE INFORMATION THINGS LIKE RESOURCES THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE RESOURCES OR TAKE RISK AND LIABILITY- HOW WOULD YOU RESPOND. TO THAT IN TERMS OF WHICH WOULD BE A BETTER WAY TO GO I THINK THAT THERE'S PROBABLY PROS AND CONS ASSOCIATED WITH EACH APPROACH AND FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IT'S REALLY VALUABLE FORCE TO BE ABLE TO. HOW LIKE TO WOULD LIKE TO HANDLE THAT DATA FOR A CITY LIKE LOS ANGELES YOU KNOW WE STORE THE TUTOR DATA IN THE SAME WAY THAT WE HANDLE THE NAME AND ADDRESS OF EVERY VICTIM OF DOMESTIC SINCE SANDRA BECAUSE DELIVER THE SORT. THE AND UNITY AND SO FOR US BEING TO HOW DINNER TAX TO THE DATA IT'S REALLY COLD FOR A VARIETY RE. AND HOW A THIRD PARTY INTERMEDIARY BETWEEN US- DOESN'TALWAYS GIVE US THE SAME LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE IN THE IN THE VERACITY OF THE DATA- THAT WE HAVE WHEN WE GET IT DIRECT AND THE VERACITY OF THE DATA. IS CRITICAL TO AS YOU KNOW AGGREGATED DATA. CAN IS ABSOLUTELY USABLE AND FINE FOR PLANNING PURPOSES OR TO DECIDE WHERE TO PUT A BIKE LANE OR DECIDE. WHETHER OR NOT WE PUT A BIKE LANE- WHETHER IT WORKED OR NOT- BUT ONLY IF WE CAN TRUST THAT DATA WHERE WHERE ACT IT DATED. HARPER US IS NOW RIGHT DELAY IN. REYES IN. AN ENFORCE AN OF. OUR WAS RIGHT. TO CREATE- A VALUABLE TOOLS FOR PLANNERS TO USE IN OUR AGENCY TO CREATE VISUALISATIONS TO BE ABLE TO DO KIND OF AT A GLANCE A LOOK AT YOU KNOW IF THERE'S A PROBLEM OR WHERE THINGS ARE ARE PILING UP FOR EXAMPLE LAST WEEKEND. THERE WAS A SICK LIVIA AN OPEN STREETS EVENT IN SOUTH LA SCOOTERS ARE NOT ALLOWED ON OPEN STREETS OFFENSE- IN LOS ANGELES AND SO WE NEEDED. OUR PLANNERS TO BE ABLE TO SEE OUR ANY COMPANIES DEPLOYING ON THE ROUTE- BECAUSE THEY HAVE MOTORS AND THEY GO FAST AND SEGOVIA'S WHERE LITTLE KIDS LEARN HOW TO RIDE BIKES SO- WE'RE ABLE TO DO THAT WORKS. THIRD PARTIES BUT FOR US WE DON'T WE WOULD PREFER TO HAVE DIRECT ACCESS TO THE DATA AND AS I'M DOCTOR CLOSER THERE ARE ALL. SIT THAT WOULD PREFER NOT TO ADD OR WOULD. DOCTOR WITH THE COMPANY LIKE POPPY OR ANOTHER IN ORDER TO SERVE THAT FUNCTION- AND CAN BE A FINE SOLUTION FOR SMALLER SEE AGENCIES THAT ARE MANAGING SORT OF. LIKE THE PATIENT. I'M SORRY. ONE MORE. IT'S JUST KNOW. FIRST TO TELL YOU PROTECT MYCIVIL LIBERTIES. BUT THIS IS. A SEEMS LIKE A WERE COMING DOWN PRETTY HARD. ON THE KIND OF IN FOR. THAT COULD BE GATHERED IS FOR BY UGH. THANK WHAT. IS WHY DO YOU WHERE DO YOU ARE AND HOW DO YOU DRAW THE- AS FAR AS WHAT WE NEED IS COVER. THE RELIES ON GOV. FOR MANY FOR. THEY'RE SAFE IS. OUT A THIS PANEL OUT ON THIS AN I HEAR COMPLAINTS ALL THE TIME WHEN THERE'S- A- LEFT THIS WHERE AND- SO THEY LOOK TO GOV. WHENEVER THEE'S A CRY OR- THE LOW THE GOVERNMENT LIKE A YOU HAVE AG TO THE HOT IT INTO SOMETHING ABOUT IT I NEED TO PREVENT THE PROBLEM FROM HAVE. SO HOW DO YOU. DRAW THE LINE HERE AS- A PROTECT OF CIVIL. BUT IT DETAILED. OKAY YEAH I DID LOCATION DATA IS WAY ON THE SIDE OF THE LINE AND THE WAY THAT YOU DRAW THE LINE IS BY GO THROUGH SOME OF AWFUL THAT WE'VE HEARD TODAY HAVING A GOAL AND ARCTIC EXACTLY WHAT THE GO IS THE REQUIRES DETAILED IN. OR IF IT DOESN'T WORK DETAILED INFORMATION. A YOU DON'T HAVE TO CALL I AM. WERE OR YOU THAT DETAIL IN ALSO UNDER THE TECH. TO AND UNDERSTAND HOW TO DEPLOY IT IN IN EFFECT WAY BUT ALL. IN THE LIMITED. TO ACHIEVE THE GOAL THE NEED AND THEN WE'LL YOU HAVE A GOAL. MANY THE COLOR. OF INFORMATION THE RETURN. THE USE THE STORES IN THE- OF ITS- YOU ACHIEVE THE GOAL BUT YOU DON'T DO A- ELSE AND IN THIS CASE YOU KNOW THE REASON WHY IN YOUR WORDS I. DOWN ON THE SHARING OF INFORMATION WHEN IT'S DUE TO LOCATION DATA IS THAT OTHER HAS BEEN. I SAW A GO AT UNIFIED BE REQUIRED THAT LEVEL OF INDIVIDUAL. DO YOU. I RISK AND- THAT'S THAT'S WHERE THE OTHER SIDE OF ONE. THANK REQUEST THANK. OF WE- ASSEMBLY WOMAN. YOUR QUESTION. SEVEN ONE FRIEDMAN. THANKS I AM A CO FOR THE RIVER FROM UBER AND FORGIVE ME I AM NOT. AS FIRST IN THE LAWS MAYBE PEOPLE WHO SAID ON JUDICIARY OR PRIVACY SO MY QUESTION IS NOT ABOUT WHAT UBER DOES WITH ITS DATA THAT'S KIND OF A RELEVANT TO MY QUESTION I'M WONDERING IN YOUR MIND WHAT THE LAW WOULD ALLOW YOU TO DO WITH THE DATA THAT YOU'RE COLLECTING. FROM YOUR USERS. AT I'M WONDERING WHAT YOU BELIEVE YOUR RESTRICTIONS ARE- BECAUSE IT OCCURS TO ME THAT EVERYTHING THAT. THE ACLU BROUGHT UP AS CONCERNS APPLY DIRECTLY TO YOU YOU KNOW YOU'RE COLLECTING ALL THIS DATA YOURSELF YOU'RE OUTSIDE OF THE- I OF THE PUBLIC IN TERMS OF ANY PUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS OUTSIDE ANY TRANSPARENCY. YOU HAVE A AN AMOUNT OF FREEDOM TO DO WITH THE INFORMATION AS YOU WISH AND EVEN THOUGH PEOPLE ARE OPTING IN TO USE YOUR DEVICES. THEY MAY OR MAY NOT UNDERSTAND THE EXTENT OF WHAT CAN BE DONE WITH THE DATA THE SAME WAY. THAT THEY MAY NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT AND LAW ENFORCEMENT OR ANY PUBLIC AGENCY COULD DO ANTI I WOULD ARGUE THAT THIS STATION HAVING THAT SEEMS TO BE READING GOVERNMENT. DID THAN ITS FOR INTO IS A. BROUGHT THERE SHOULD BE A- THAT A OF. YOU KNOW YOU WE ALLOW THE COLLECTION IN THE STE OF DATA OR DON'T GIVEN THE COMPANIES THAT OWN THE TECH BY NOW HAVE TO KNOW A LOT OF IN ABOUT USER I DON'T KNOW THAT WOULD BE KIND OF PHYLLIS ARE LEGALLY DIFFERENT THAN WHAT A WHY IT MIGHT WANT TO ALSO UNDER I AM I UNDERSTAND THERE ARE SOME LIMITS TO THE- BUT I'M- UBER WHERE FEEL THAT YOUR KIND OF OWNERS OR EXPLOIT. OF THE DAY IT COLLECTS U. N.'S AN ARTIST GIVE AN EXAM. YOU MIGHT VERY WELL. COME TO THE SAME. ABOUT USER PRESS. BY WAY OF WHERE THEY'RE STOPPING ALONG THE ROUTE. AND I'M WONDERING IF NOT THAT WHETHER YOU WOULD DO THIS BUT WHETHER YOU COULD IF YOU CHOSE. MARKET PRODUCTS TO THOSE USERS BASED ON WHETHER STOPPING ALONG THE WAY- IF YOU BELIEVE THAT YOU. THE LEGAL ABILITY TO COLLECTED TO START BUILDING PROFILES OF THEIR CONSUMER PREFERENCES UP THEIR TRAVEL HABITS- EVEN IF IT'S A- GATED DATA BASED ON ZIP CODE. SO I'M WONDERING NOW WHAT YOU DO DO BUT WHAT YOU BELIEVE LEGALLY YOU WOULD BE ENTITLED TO DO WITH THE DATA THAT YOU'RE COLLECTING. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION I THINK ONE KEY DIFFERENCE IS THAT WE ARE REGULATED BY PRIVACY LAWS NOW WHETHER THAT CC PA- CCPA APPLIES TO ONLY PRIVATE SECTOR BODIES AND THAT'S- QUITE A DISTINCTION FROM A LAW LIKE JEEP. FOR EXAMPLE IN THE U. THAT APPLIES TO BOTH THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND PUBLIC SECTOR ENTITIES I THINK A LAW LIKE THAT IS USEFUL BECAUSE- IT ACTUALLY UNLOCKS DATA SHARING BETWEEN THE PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SECTORS IF WE FEEL THAT. OUR DATA IS BEING PROTECTED NO MATTER WHERE IT'S ORIGINATING AND WHERE IT'S LANDING- THAN THAT UNLOCKS A LOT OF DATA SHARING THAT COULD BE HELPFUL IN THE UNITED STATES BUT I BUT AGAIN I THINK THE KEY DISTINCT. AND IS THAT THE CZ A. N. OPERA. A FORTHCOMING PRICE LAW MY TO BE USED APPLET TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND I THINK THAT. WE HAVE REAL LEGAL LIABILITY. WE MISSED YOU OR I SHOULD ARE THE BRIDGE. NAPA I THINK THAT IN GENERAL THERE'S AT THEIR A SHORTCUT PRIVACY IN THE U. STATES. TO THIS. INTO WE HAVE OUR OWN. PRINCIPLES THAT WE HOLD IS FOR ANY OF OUR- RECALL. THAT THERE BE A FAIR INFORMATION. PRINCIPLE SOME THOSE SUPPOSING. CAN CAN TO KNOW IT ON NOT ASKING WHAT YOU DO. I GONNA PUT ASIDE FOR A MINUTE. ALL OF YOUR INTERNAL. AND WERE YOU ABLE. YOU DO. THIS YOUR- COMPANY. TECH YOUR CUST. CUSTOMER I WERE BRENT MY MICRO MOBILITY DEVICE. PUTTING ASIDE ANY SHARING OF DATA WHAT WHAT WHAT ARE THE LIMITS OF WHAT I AS THAT COMPANY COULD DO WITH THAT DATA COULD I DIRECT MARKET. COULD I. GIVE YOU A LONER OFFER YOU A LOAN BASED ON WHAT I THINK YOU'RE PURCHASING PROTECT WAS BASED ON WHAT RESTAURANTS YOU'RE ATING AT WHAT COULD I WHERE DO YOU THINK THE LEGAL LIMIT IS A- BAD IDEA TO BE IS. WHAT WE CAN DO IS WHAT WE CAN OKAY TO USERS AND THAT'S REQUIRED B THE LAW. HI PURPOSE LIMITATION IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AND WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS WE CAN ONLY USE DATA FOR THE REASON IT WAS COLLECTED IN THE FIRST PLACE IF WE COLLECT YOUR LOCATION DATA IN ORDER TO SEND YOU A CALL OUR- TRANSPORT YOU. I NEED TO BE IN THAT. PATIENT DATA HAS. FOR IF. IN THE EXAMPLE PROVIDED WE WANT TO PROVIDE YOU KNOW WE WANT TO PROMOTE SOME SORT OF PRODUCT ON WHERE YOU'RE- WELL WE BETTER. YOU IF YOU ARE ABLE WITHOUT USING YOUR DATA FOR THAT REASON AND IF YOU'RE NOT COMFORTABLE WITH IT THEN WE BETTER PROVIDE AN OPT OUT FOR IT. AND YOU CALL THE DATA EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT USING IT. FOR ANY PURPOSE. RIGHT BASED ON DATA MINIMIZATION AND PURPOSE LIMITATION PRINCIPLES AND THOSE INCLUDED IN THE CITY PA NOW IF WE DON'T HAVE A CONCRETE USE CASE THAT WE CAN COMMUNICATE TO OUR USERS. THE NOTE WE CAN'T COLLECT THAT. THAT'S HELPFUL THANK YOU JACKSON- I BELIEVE WE'RE FINISHED WITH THIS PANEL THANK YOU FOR YOUR VERY MUCH AND WE'LL MOVE ON SENATOR JACKSON'S WILL CONVENE THE NEXT POWER. OBVIOUSLY THERE'S MUCH MORE WE COULD TALK ABOUT AND- PERHAPS WE WILL AT SOME POINT- BUT NOW WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO OUR SECOND PANEL- THIS IS OUR FINAL PANEL WE'RE GOING TO DRILL INTO VARIOUS PERSPECTIVES ON PRIVACY AND WHAT CAN BE DONE TO ENSURE. THAT ANY INFORMATION THAT YOU SHARE WITH RESPECT TO SHARED MOBILITY DEVICE. IS DONE WITH THE APPROPRIATE GUARD RAILS AND IS LIMITED TO ONLY THAT INFORMATION THAT IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY AS WAS JUST ARTICULATED- BY MISS OF OUR OWN OF UBER- THAT IS CERTAINLY THE GOAL OF CCPA. WILL HEAR A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT HOW THAT'LL WORK AND SO WITH THAT WE HAVE DOCTOR MATTHEW BISHOP. JOINING US DOCTOR BISHOP IS TAKE A PROFESSOR OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND THE CO DIRECTOR. OF THE COMPUTER SECURITY LABORATORY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS. AND WE HAVE WITH US MARIE CO KOTANI WHO IS THE DEPUTY LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL IN THE OFFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL HERE IN THE CAPITAL AND I BELIEVE WE WERE JUST HANDED A LETTER THAT WAS. WRITTEN THAT- RESPECTFULLY DISAGREES WITH HER ANALYSIS ON- OF WHAT. HEALTH THE EXPERTS A PROVIDE TWO DOZEN PROVIDE PERHAPS WE CAN HEAR HER TALK A LITTLE ABOUT THAT WE ALSO HAVE WITH US RAMS SYSTEM- A DO WHO IS VICE CHAIR OF THE OPEN MOBILITY FOUNDATION I HOPE THAT I PRONOUNCE THAT CORRECTLY THANK YOU SIR AND JENNIFER DOLE- DONLIN WHY IT TOO IS THE TRANSPORTATION PLANNING MANAGER FOR THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO GOOD AFTERNOON. AND DAVID ALISON SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF DATA FOR BIRD AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST JAMIE LEE WILLIAMS A STAFF ATTORNEY FOR THE ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING AND SHARING YOUR INSIGHTS WE ARE RUNNING A LITTLE OVER SO I'M GONNA TRY TO. HAMMER YOU DOWN AFTER FIVE MINUTES AND WILL- HOPE YOU HAVE SOME QUESTIONS FOR YOU AT THE END OF THE PANEL SO WITH THAT- DOCTOR MATTHEW BISHOP THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK HERE TODAY- AS YOU'VE HEARD DATA NEEDS TO BE RELEASED FOR ANALYSIS BY OTHERS. AND IF YOU CAN CONTROL WHO HAS ACCESS TO IT THEN YOU CAN TAKE DR JOHN IS APPROACHING USE- CYBER SECURITY CONTROLS. TO BLOCK THE TWO ARE PROTECTED. BUT IF YOU CAN'T CONTROL ACCESS OR IF YOU HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THE ACCESS CONTROLS WON'T WORK- THEN YOU NEED TO USE DATA ANONYMOUS. SOMETIMES CALLED THE IDENTIFICATION OF SENSATION. THE PROBLEM WITH THIS IS THAT OFTEN INTERFERES WITH THE UTILITYOF THE USEFULNESS OF THE DATA AND SO YOU HAVE TO BALANCE THE NEED FOR THE DATA WITH THE EFFECT IT HAS ON RELEASING IT MIGHT HAVE ON BOTH THE OWNER OF THE DATA IN THE SUBJECT OF THE DATA AND HERE'S AN EXAMPLE AMERICA ONLINE AT ONE POINT RELEASED THREE MONTHS OF SEARCH RECORDS. AND THE VERY CAREFULLY ANONYMOUS THEM. IT WAS UP FOR THREE DAYS. DURING THAT TIME NEW YORK TIMES REPORTERS WERE ABLE TWENTY IDENTIFY ONE OF THE USERS AND THE VALIDATED THIS BY GOING TO THE LADY AND TALKING TORRENT SHOWING HER TO SEARCH RECORDS AND SHE SAID YES THOSE ARE MINE. SO THERE TWO POINTS FROM THIS THE FIRST ONE IS THAT ADVERSARIES CAN USE DATA THAT'S NOT PART OF WHAT YOU RELEASE. THE ANONYMIZE THE DATA YOU DO RELEASE. AND THE SECOND PART IS A LITTLE BIT MORE INTERESTING AND WORRISOME NAMELY THAT. EVER SINCE THE PEOPLE WHO WERE DOING THE DENOMINATION MAY DRAW INCORRECT CONCLUSIONS FROM THE DATA FOR EXAMPLE THE REPORTERS FROM THE TIMES. I DREW THE CONCLUSION THAT THIS LADY HAD A LOT OF MEDICAL PROBLEMS. TURNED OUT SHE DIDN'T SHE WAS A NURSE WHO RETIRED NURSE WHO WAS SEARCHING THE INTERNET FOR HELP FOR. YOUR FRIEND. THE YOU HEARD WHAT TIME. TRANSFER DATA INCLUDE. AND ALSO- EXAMPLES OF ITS UTILITY FOR EXAMPLE HOW OFTEN VEHICLES USED HOW TRAFFIC PATTERNS WORK THINGS LIKE THAT. SO TO ANONYMIZE THE DATA OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SUPPRESS THE NAME OF THE PERSON BUT YOU ALSO IS POINTED OUT HAVE TO SUPPRESS ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH OTHER PARTS OF THE DATA. THAT FOR EXAMPLE FOR A PICK UP LOCATION AND TIME OR DROP OFF LOCATION TIME IF I CAN CORRELATE THE TWO OF ESPECIALLY FOR IN THE PAST AND MAY BE ABLE TO GROW WITH THAT PERSON LEAVES FOR WHERE THAT PERSON WORKS. IF THIS THING UNIQUE ABOUT THE RECORD AS WELL USE THAT. AND ALSO AS WAS POINTED OUT ON THESE ASSOCIATIONS MAY NOT BE OBVIOUS OF FOR EXAMPLE- MASSACHUSETTS A FEW YEARS BACK RELEASED HEAVILY ANONYMIZED RECORDS MEDICAL DATA AMPLE TIME TO SWING HERE RESEARCHER AT HARVARD WAS ABLE TO IDENTIFY THE RECORD BELONGING TO THE GOVERNOR. AND THE REASON SHE WAS IT. WAS BECAUSE SHE MATCH THE ZIP CODE CHEN HIS GENDER AND THE DATE OF BIRTH WITH THE RECORDS AND IT TURNED OUT HE WAS THE ONLY ONE QUICK THOSE THREE QUALITIES. IN FACT FROM THOSE THREE YOU CAN IDENTIFY 87% OF THE HOUSEHOLDS IN THE US ACCORDING TO A TINY SWEENEY STANFORD SAYS NO IT'S ONLY 63% IS ANOTHER X. EVEN THE SO YOU CAN USE WHAT'S CALLED PEOPLE EARNING YOUR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TO FIND A LOT OF THESE NON OBVIOUS RELATIONSHIPS. ON NOW ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF DATA WHICH APPARENTLY IS SEPARATE. AND CAN BE ANONYMIZED BUT WHEN YOU PUT THEM TOGETHER YOU OF TROUBLE CAME OUT OF OHIO- IN OHIO THEY PUT AN ELECTION THEY HAVE POLL BOOKS WHERE THEY RECORD THE NAME OF THE PERSON IN THE TIME THAT. CAME INTO THE POLICE STATION. AT THIS TIME THEY WERE USING ELECTRONIC VOTING MACHINES WHICH PRINT AT THE BOTTOM OF THE CAST BALLOTS A TIME STAMP SAYING ONE IT WAS CAST. NOW IN OHIO AND I'M SORRY I DON'T KNOW THE LEAL TERM BUT IN OHIO BOTH OF THOSE AT THIS TIME WITH. I THINK PUBLIC RECORD. WHEN HIS RESEARCHERS WERE ABLE TO GET BOTH OF THEM. ONE OF THEM COULD NOT BE THE AMOUNT OF MICE. SEPARATELY PUTTING TOGETHER MATCH AT THE TIME STAMPS AND THEY WERE ABLE TO. FIGURE OUT HOW AN AWFUL LOT OF PEOPLE VOTED. ARE YOU ALSO NEED TO- CONSIDER. THAT IF THE DATE IS HELD BY MULTIPLE GROUPS. AND THE GROUP'S ANONYMIZE THE DATA AND THEN RELEASE IT. CAN THE DATA BE PUT TOGETHER AND THE COMBINATION OF THE DATA STOP THE DATA SETS ON BE DO NOT BE DEBT. THE AMOUNT CIVIL SORRY. ALSO IF YOU RECENT DATA NOW AND LATER ON SOME OTHER DATA COMES OUT. THOSE TWO SETS SEPARATELY YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO BE ANONYMIZED THEM PUT THEM TOGETHER AND YOU MAY BE ABLE TO DO SO YOU HAVE TO LOOK THE FUTURE AND WHAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE DOING AS WELL AS WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO- THEY'RE BASICALLY THREE WAYS TO AND ON MY STATE OF THE FIRST ONES TO GENERALIZE IT THAT'S WHAT HIP BUT DOES FOR ZIP CODES- WITH HIPPIE YOU HAVE TO SUPPRESS THE LAST. DIGIT ZIP CODE AND IF THE THREE DIGIT FATHER THREE DIGIT PREFIX HAS LESS THAN TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE IN THAT AREA. THE WHOLE THING. BUT YOU GENERALIZING ON THOSE NUMBERS. YOU ALSO PUT DATA THIS IS GETTING. AND SO YOU MIGHT FOR. ANDERSON SOME RANDOM NUMBER TWO MIRACLE DATA. THE WITH THAT IS THATYOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ANONYMIZED DATA THE ONE THAT'S- PER TERM IT'S JUST AS USEFUL AS THE D. ANONYMOUS THE REGULAR ON AND OUT OF MY STATE. AND THE THIRD MESSAGES AGGREGATION THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE MORE INTERESTED IN THE STATE'S SIX OF THE DATA SO YOU PUT TOGETHER. AND RELEASE THE OILS THE CENSUS BUREAU DOES A LOT OF THAT THERE'S A LOT OF WORK IN THAT AREA. SO WHAT WE DO WELL THERE ARE A COUPLE OF THINGS PEOPLE YOU HAVE TO BE AWARE OF. FIRST YOU HAVE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE INFORMATION ITS EXTERNAL. TO THE DAILY OR NOT I'M ICING. AND THIS USED TO BE VERY EASY BECAUSE BEFORE THE INTERNET AND THE WEB. YOU HAD TO TRAVEL TO PLACES TO GET THIS DATA. NOW IT'S OFTEN ON THE WEB AND YOU CAN PULL IT DOWN. AND IT ALSO ANONYMIZING SUCCESSFULLY ALSO DEPENDS UPON WHAT. MAKE WHAT MAY BE A MUST BE KEPT SECRET NOW BUT ALSO IN THE FUTURE. BECAUSE THE DATA MAY NEED TO BE PRESERVED THE ANONYMITY OF THE DATA MAY BE PRESERVED FOR QUITE SOME TIME. YOU ALSO NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THE THREATS BOTH ONCE IT WOULD COMPROMISE THE HOLDER OF THE DATA AND ALSO THE SUBJECT. AND SOMETIMES PEOPLE WHO'D BE ANONYMIZED DATA RE INTERESTED IN THINGS OTHER THAN WHAT YOU THINK THEY MIGHT BE OUR OTHER THAN WHAT YOU'RE INTERESTED IN. SO I GUESS TO SUM UP. THEIR TWO POINTS YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE TRADE OFF BETWEEN PRIVACY AND UTILITY THAT'S ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL NOT JUST FROM THE SCIENTIFIC AND ENGINEERING VIEWPOINT BUT ALSO FROM THE SOCIAL POLITICAL AND- ECONOMIC AND GOVERNMENTAL POINT OF VIEW. AND THE OTHER THING TOO IS- DESIGN PRIVACY IN AT THE BEGINNING DON'T TRY TO EDIT IT THE AFTERWARDS- THAT'S TRUE IS IT NOT JUST FOR PRIVACY BUT FOR SECURITY IN GENERAL. A NUMBER OF SYSTEMS THAT HAVE BEEN BROKEN. WERE HAD QUITE A BIT OF SECURITY BUT BECAUSE IT WAS ADDED AFTERWARDS PEOPLE FOUND FOSTER. I LOOK FORWARD TO ANSWERING QUESTIONS THINKING THANK YOU VERY MUCH- INTO THAT WAS A LITTLE LONGER THAN FIVE MINUTES BUT VERY HELPFUL MUCH APPRECIATED. OUR NEXT SPEAKER- IN ADDITION FEEL BAD I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T MENTION THAT BUT THANK YOU FOR THE THAT AIM FOR INTERESTING INFORMATION WE HAVE NOW. OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS- RICO COULD CONNIE. OF THE DEPUTY LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL FOR THE OFFICE OF OUR LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL GOOD AFTERNOON AFTERNOON SO TODAY WE'VE BEEN ASKED TWO QUESTIONS RELATING TO CALIFORNIA'S ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS PRIVACY ACT OTHERWISE KNOWN AS CAL THAT BOOK. THE FIRST IS WHETHER CALIPERS CHECKS THE DEPARTMENT OF THE CITY ORCOUNTY FROM IMPOSING A REAL TIME DATA SHARING PERMITTING REQUIREMENT ON ADULT DISABILITY PROVIDER OFFER CONTEXT HELLO BUT PROHIBITS THE GOVERNMENT ENTITY FROM ACQUIRING A- NATION A THROUGH THE PACIFIC MEANS WITHOUT A WIRE WARRANTS WIRETAP ORDERS OTHER OUT CLICK APPLICABLES EXCEPTION. SO THE BUT IT MEANS THAT THE ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION INFORMATION FOR SAYS GOVERNMENT ENTITY CAN'T COMPEL THE PRODUCTION OF IRAQ THIS TO THAT INFORMATION FROM A SERVICE PROVIDER COLLECTS WAS OTHER TO PUT PROVISIONS THOSE CONCERNS ELECTRONIC DEVICE INFORMATION. ON WHICH COLLECTED DEFINES AS INFORMATION THAT STORED ON OR GENERATED THROUGH THE OPERATION OF AN ELECTRONIC DEVICE WHICH WOULD INCLUDE DEVICES SUCH AS THE U. BUT THESE CRITTERS THAT ARE OFFERED BY DAHLE INSTABILITY PROVIDERS KELEFA PROHIBITS A GOVERNMENT ENTITY FROM EITHER COMPELLING THE OF THIS TO DO THE AND MAY. FROM OTHER THAN THE THAT'S RATHER. AT THE PROHIBITS GOT ENTITIES. MEN AND XIN BY TO BE IN. THE DEVICE BIKE A SCOOTER IT'S UNLESS BERMAN AND EIGHTY HAS EITHER THE- THIS CONSENTS OF THE AUTHOR US SIR OR IS THE BEEN LOS OR STOLEN IT HAS THE SPECIFIC CONSENT OF. THE OWNER OF THE DEVICE. ANNE'S ALL OF THESE THREE PROVISIONS THEY APPLY TO ACTION TAKEN BY GOVERNMENT ENTITY SO RETURNING BACK TO THE QUESTION HAND WHICH IS WHETHER CAL UP OR STRICT APARTMENT OF A CITY OR COUNTY FROM IMPOSING. A REAL TIME TO GET ENSURING BERMAN REQUIREMENTS. THE FIRST QUESTION IS OKAY WITH AS A DEPARTMENT OF A CITY OR COUNTY CONSTITUTE A GOVERNMENT ENTITY FOR THE PURPOSES OF CAL THAT BUT TO BEGIN WITH AND IN OUR OPINION IT DOES. CALIBRATE BROADLY DEFINED GOVERNMENT ENTITY AS EIGHT DEPARTMENT OR AGENCY OF THE STATE OR SUBDIVISION OF THE STATE AND THAT WOULD INCLUDE CITIES AND COUNTIES SORT ALSO INCLUDES DEPARTMENTS THE CITIES AND COUNTIES. OKAY MOVING ON TO WHAT'S THE SECOND PART OF THE QUESTION OF WHICH IS OF. IMPOSING A REAL TIME DATA SHARING PERMITTING REQUIREMENTS. WHAT THE SECOND QUESTION SECOND PART OF THE QUESTION IS HE DOES THAT FALL WITHIN ANY OF THE MEANS OF COLLECTING. ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS ELECTRONIC INFORMATION THAT'S PROHIBITED BY CAL APPLE AND ARGUED DOES IT VIOLATES THAT SECOND PROHIBITION WOULD SAYS GOVERNMENT ENTITY YOU CAN'T. COMPEL THE PRODUCTION OF OR ACCESS TO ELECTRONIC DEVICE INFORMATION FROM ANYONE DECIDES. THE AUTHORIZES US OR LET OF ICE AND IT'S ARGUE THAT. WHEN SOMEONE RENTS ONE OF THESE SURE IT'S GOOD AS OUR SHARED BIKES THERE THE AUTHORIZED POSSESSOR OF THAT SURE IT'S GOOD OR THAT BIKE. DURING THE PERIOD OF THAT RENTAL SO TO THE EXTENT. THAT THE GOVERNMENT IDEAS REQUIRING FOR VERSION OF THAT DATA FROM THE- DOCK DISABILITY PROVIDER AND NOT THE WRITER DURING THE CURATOR THAT RENTAL. THAT WOULD IMPLICATE CALL APPLE. SO IN OTHER WORDS IT'S ARGUE THAT. STRICT OTHER FORM OF A CITY OR FROM IMPOSING A REAL TIME DATA SHARING. MARK PERMITTING. ON ADULT LIST WILL YOU PROVIDER. NEXT QUESTION WHERE ON IS WHETHER IT COLLECT. IT PROTECTS INFORMATION THAT'S BEEN THAT'S PUBLICLY AVAILABLE BUT IT'S BEEN DE IDENTIFIED OR IS AN AGGREGATED. AND IT'S ARGUE THAT ALTHOUGH CALIPER PROTECTS ELECTRONIC INFORMATION REGARDLESS OF WHETHER IT'S PUBLICLY AVAILABLE OR DE AGGREGATED. AND WE'RE NOT AS TECHNICALLY SAVVY AS DOCTOR BISHOP SO I'M TALKING ABOUT THE AT THE SENATE ACT NOT. OF ITS NEST RICHARDS- ALTHOUGH IT FOR TAX INFORMATION REGARDLESS OF WHETHER IT'S BEEN. IT'S PUBLIC YOU WILL PUBLICLY AVAILABLE OR GET IN A FIGHT IT. ONLY PROTECTS AGGREGATED DATA TO THE EXTENT THAT REVEALING THAT THE IT WOULD ALSO REVEAL ELECTRONIC INFORMATION THAT OTHERWISE PROTECTED BY CAL APPLE. THIS IS BECAUSE WE'RE NOT SEEING ANYTHING IN THE TAXES COLLECTED THAT DISTINGUISHES ON THE BASIS OF PUBLIC AVAILABILITY OR A PERSONAL IDENTIFICATION. AND ALSO. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AGGREGATED DATA WERE TALKING ABOUT DATA THAT'S CREATED USING LIKE THAT UNDERLYING DATA WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SUMMARIES OF DATA WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. IS COMPILED TO OTHER FORMS SO THAT WE BELIEVE THAT CAL ACT. PROTECTS THE UNDERLING THE UNDERLYING DATA DOESN'T NECESSARILY PROTECT. OTHER THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN DONE WITH THAT DATA. AND ALL THE HAVE YOU TAKE A QUICK LATER. THANK YOU VERY. OUR NEXT US. IS RAY SYSTEM A DO. AND HE'S THE VICE CHAIR OF OPEN MOBILITY FOUNDATION GOOD AFTERNOON AFTERNOON CHAIRS- IN JUST TO DO A DIVISION MANAGER OF PLANNING POLICY SUSTAINABILITY FOR THE CITY OF SAN JOSE AND THE VICE CHAIR OF THE OPEN MOBILITY FOUNDATION I THINK BOTH ROLES ARE IMPORTANT HERE. SO WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN THE ROADWAY IS CHANGING GREATLY. RIGHT WE'RE SEEING MORE AND MORE SERVICES BEING PROVIDED IN THE RIGHT OF WAY. ON THAT ARE BEING RUN BY PRIVATE INTELLIGENCE RIGHT BY DATA SETS A BY ALGORITHMS AND BY WAYS AND MEANS THAT HAVE- THAT ARE BECOMING MORE AND MORE COMPLEX THAN THAT CITIES DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO AT THE MOMENT. THE PUBLIC NEEDS TOOLS TO BE ABLE TO STEP INTO THE SPACE AND BE PART OF GOVERNANCE OF THESE. DEVICES OF THESE SERVICES. OTHERWISE WE WILL LOSE THE ABILITY. TO CONTINUE TO MANAGE THE RIGHT OF WAY ALL RIGHT. A LOT OF THIS DISCUSSION FEELS LIKE A PUBLIC VERSUS PRIVATE DISCUSSION. AND IT'S NOT THIS IS A DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW WE AS A SOCIETY ARE GOING TO STEP TOGETHER FORD INTO THESE NEW TOOLS AND HOW WE'RE GOING TO MANAGE THE PUBLIC GOOD AND ALLOW BUSINESSES TO THRIVE. AND WE AT THE OPEN MOBILITY FOUNDATION ARE SETTING OURSELVES UP TO. BE THE FORUM IN WHICH THOSE DISCUSSIONS HAPPEN AND A FULL OPEN WAY. THERE'S ACRIMONY AND THERE'S A LOT OF CONTENTION AROUND THIS. BUT I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT EVEN ONE OF OUR MOST STRIDENT CRITICS IS ACTUALLY ONE OF OUR MOST ACTIVE CONTRIBUTORS. UBER'S JUMP IS ACTUALLY ONE OF THE MOST ACTIVE CONTRIBUTORS TO OUR ACTUAL CODE BASE I THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE. THE CAMPUS. THE WAY THAT THE RIGHT OF WAY HAS BEEN MANAGED- FOR AS LONG AS WE'VE KIND OF KNOWN WRITER STOP SIGN STREET LIGHTS GOT A LITTLE MORE CUTS IF INSTIGATED THESE WORKS WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO MANAGE INDIVIDUALS AND UNSOPHISTICATED BUSINESSES. THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH ANYMORE. WE NEED NEW TOOLS- THAT WORK DIRECTLY WITH THE SYSTEMS THAT ARE CONTROLLING DEVICES. A STOP SIGN IS VISUAL ITEM THE PERSON OR I A OUR SYSTEM IS CONTROLLING WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THAT CAN IMMEDIATELY READ THAT AND OPERATE WITHOUT. WE NEED NEW TOOLS AS THE PUBLIC THAT WORK TOGETHER WITH THE BUSINESS SYSTEMS. SO THAT WE ARE ABLE TO OPERATE TOGETHER. AND TO THAT A FUNDAMENTAL CITY LEVEL THAT'S WHAT WE'RE INTERESTED IN. LET'S SEE WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO EXPRESS PUBLIC- THE PUBLIC GOOD IN THE WAYS THAT ALGORITHMS CAN CONSUME. SO THAT THE ARGUMENTS ABOUT THE PATCHWORK OF FIVE REGULATIONS STARTS FALLING AWAY. IT'S OKAY IF THERE'S DIFFERENT REGULATIONS IF WE ARE ABLE TO SAY IN EACH JURISDICTION THIS IS WHAT IT IS AND THOSE SYSTEMS CAN CLEANLY AND EASILY OPERATE WITHIN THE. THIS NEW LANGUAGE AND DATA SPECIFICATION- FOR PUBLIC FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD. FIRST SORRY. WE NEED TO CREATE THIS DIGITAL COMMONS- OF NEW RULES IN A NEW LANGUAGE- TO EXPRESS THIS AND BE ABLE TO ALLOW- PRIVATE COMPANIES TO WORK WITH IT. OVER TIME AND WE NEED TO ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN- AS THE CONVERSATION PROGRESSES. I HAVE ONE PERSON ON MY TEAM WHO MANAGES SIX THOUSAND SCOOTERS. I ONLY EXPECT THAT NUMBER TO INCREASE. I NEED TO KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THOSE DEVICES SO THAT I CAN MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE IN WHEELCHAIRS CAN GET THROUGH MY CITY. SO I CAN MAKE SURE. THAT WE ARE- THAT THE- CUT COMPANIES ARE FOLLOWING OUR EQUITY CONSIDERATION RULES. RIGHT AND ONE PERSON HAS TO DO THIS IF I DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO DATA VERIFIABLE INDIVIDUAL DEVICE DATA NOT PERSONAL DATA. WE CAN'T DO THIS. TO THE OPEN ABILITY FOUNDATION- HAS BEEN SET ITSELF UP AS A FORM TO PROGRESS THE STATE OF PRACTICE. WE DON'T PROFESS TO KNOW THE ANSWERS BUT WE DO PROFESSED TO KNOW THAT WE NEED TO FIND THEM TOGETHER WE UNDERSTAND THAT PRIVACY IS A CENTRAL COMPONENT FOR SUCCESS ON ALL SIDES AND AS SUCH- IN OUR OPENING ACTIONS FOR OUR FOUNDATION WE SET UP A PRIVACY COMMITTEE THAT PRIVACY COMMITTEE- WAS SPECIFICALLY SET UP TO ADVISE THE FOUNDATION ON PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICES THAT ENSURE THE SECURE HANDLING A MOBILITY DATA. THAT IS ONE OF OUR MOST ACTIVE COMMITTEES- AND IS OPEN TO ALL THAT WANT TO ENGAGE. MOST OF OUR COMMITTEES ARE LITTLE MORE CLOSE JUST A MEMBERSHIP BUT THIS ONE SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE OF THE- THAT WEIGHT. AND IMPORTANCE OF THIS- PRICE OF THIS ITEM WE SET ALL ANYBODY NO AS A MATTER WHAT. WE INVITE YOU AND YOUR STAFF TO JOIN IF THAT SO SUITS YOU THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY COMPLEX FIELD. WE DON'T KNOW ENOUGH. TO START SAYING LET'S START PUTTING DOORS DOWN AROUND THIS YET WE KNOW IT'S INCREDIBLY SENSITIVE IMPORTANT. BUT THERE ARE TOO MANY STRIDENT VOICES ON THAT ARE TRYING TO GET US TO DO VERY PARTICULAR THINGS. AND CLAIMING A LOT OF- FIVE FEAR IN HERE SAY THAT IS NOT YET TOTALLY SUBSTANTIATED AND I AM VERY WORRIED THAT WE CAN GET INTO A SITUATION WE'RE GONNA SHUT OURSELVES DOWN LIKE WE DID WITH TEEN SEES. WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO PROPERLY REGULATE OR INTERACT WITH TEENS HE'S A CITIES BECAUSE WE DO NOT HAVE DATA ON WHAT THEIR EFFECTS ARE. AND WHEN THAT DATA DOES COME TO THE LIGHT. WE LEARN THINGS LIKE 40% OF NEW TRAFFIC IN SAN FRANCISCO IT'S FROM TNC EASE. IT TOOK YEARS FOR THAT DATA TO COME TO LIGHT AND WE AS REGULATORS IN THE PUBLIC THAT THE EXPRESSIONS OF PUBLIC INTEREST HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE. TO GET OUR HANDS ON THAT IN A REGULARIZED WAY THANK YOU APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY I'M SURE THEY'LL BE SOME QUESTIONS. OUR NEXT WITNESS HERE IT IS- JENNIFER DONLIN WHY IT. A WYANT EXCUSE ME WHO IS THE TRANSPORTATION PLANNING MANAGER FOR THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO WELCOME. AFTERNOON CHAIRS AND MEMBERS ARE JENNIFER DOMINO I IT'S I WON'T REINTRODUCE MYSELF BUT- I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR INVITING CITY SACRAMENTO AGAIN WE ARE THE SCRAPPY MID SIZE CITY- WHO APPRECIATES AT BEING THE STATE CAPITOL AND HAVING YOU HERE- LIKE LOS ANGELES WE ARE ALSO ACCOUNTABLE TO OUR RESIDENTS ARE EMPLOYERS OUR EMPLOYEES AND OUR BUSINESSES. AND MANAGING TRANSPORTATION IS LIKE MANAGING UTILITY WE ARE STEWARDS OF THE RIGHT OF WAY- IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE GOOD DATA. AND DATA TO MANAGE- HOW WE HOW WE OPERATE IT'S- TIME TO GO OVER A COUPLE OF THINGS ON THE DTA THAT WE CURRENTLY CURRENTLY COLLECTED HOW WE USE IT AND THEN THE IMPORTANCE OF HOW WE HANDLE OUR PRIVACY. I'M SO WE HAVE WE COLLECT OUR DATA THROUGH MDS MOBILITY DATA SPECIFICATIONS AS WELL AS G. BFS GENERAL BIKES ARE SPECIFICATION DATA- WE DO THAT IN TWO WAYS TO MANAGER SHARE MOBILITY SYSTEMS THAT WE HAVE HERE IN THE CITY. BOTH HER BIKE SHARE SCOOTER SHARE- MOST LIKELY COMING FOR MOPEDS WILL BE HERE SOON IN THE FUTURE HOVER BOARDS OR WHATEVER COME NEXT WE THINK IT'S A REALLY GOOD FOUNDATION. FOR THE COLLECTED DATA- WE DO NOT COLLECT PERSONALLY IT ON ANY OF OUR USERS SO WE DO NOT COLLECT REAL TIME DATA AT THIS TIME. WE COLLECT THE NUMBER OF TRIPS WHICH IS AGGREGATED WE COLLECT THE NUMBER OF ACTIVE VEHICLES WHICH IS AGGREGATED. TOTAL DISTANCE AGGREGATED AVERAGE TOOK TIME AGGRAVATED- AND THEN FOR A COUNCIL MEMBERS WHO ARE VERY. KEEN ON FIRST AND LAST MILE TRIPS WE COLLECT THE DATA ON WHETHER OR NOT IT STARTS OR ENDS AT TRANSIT. AND THEN EQUITY IS A BIG PIECE OF OUR CITY WE WANT TO MAKE SURE 20% OF OUR DEVICES. TO ACT SO IT WOULD BE THAT. WE ALSO LIKE TO BROWN. AND I WAS DESCRIBED EARLIER THIS IS TRUE BROUGHT NAY. IS AGGREGATED WE USE SHARED. WILL MET. WHICH IS A- NONPROFIT. THAT AGGREGATES THE DATA FOR US AND THEN OUR OWN INTERNAL TEAMS HAVE BUILT OR DATED ASH BOARD I AM INCREDIBLY PROUD. OF ALREADY IT SEEMS OF THE CITY SACRAMENTO AGAIN WE ARE A SMALL SCRAPPY CITY. BUT THEY DO A LOT WITH WHAT WE HAVE. SO WE COLLECT TRIP ROUTE DATA NOT. IDENTIFIED WITH ANYBODY START POINTER AND POINT BUT JUST WHERE THE HOT SPOTS ARE. YOU MIGHT NOT BE SURPRISED THAT A LOT OF ACTIVITIES AROUND THE CAPITAL- THOUGH IT'S A GOOD PLACE TO SKEW AND RIDE. WE ALSO COLLECT INFORMATION ON REPORTED ISSUE OR UP ON TRIPS PER BLOCKS IS HOW IT'S COLLECTED SO YOU SEE THIS EXAMPLE HERE FOR THOSE YOU CAN'T SEE BACK THERE. ON THIS ONE BLOCK SEGMENT WHICH IS RIGHT HERE NEAR THE CAPITAL WE HAD NEARLY FIFTEEN HUNDRED TRIPS OF SURE MOBILITY THIS TELLS US THAT THERE IS A NEED FOR SPACE. I NEED FOR A BIKE WAY OR WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE MOVING FOR INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT INFORMATION. HI MY- NO IT'S CLOSED ON ME. TO GO. OUT AND THEN WE COLLECTED TRIP AND DATA AS WELL AS TRIPS ARE DATA THEY ARE NOT RELATED IN ANY WAY TO. THE TRIP ROUTE DATA AND THE END AND START ALSO ARE NOT COLLECTED CONNECTED CONNECTED WITH EACH OTHER- WE DO THIS FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS WE NEED TO KNOW WHERE TO PUT. PARKING AS THE BIGGEST THING IS ISSUE WITH SURE ABILITY IS NOT SO MUCH- THAT CAUSING HAVOC ON CITY WE ACTUALLY THINK THEY'RE A GREAT THING THEY'RE GONNA HELP US SOLVE A LOT OF ROOM ABILITY CHILD. IS REGROW- SO WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHERE OUR PARKING IS NEEDED SO MUCH SO THAT GETS A- OF WHEN THIS ONE BLOCK SEGMENT WE KNEW THAT WE HAD THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX PARKING EVENTS. THERE IS A HIGH NEED FOR PARKING ACTIVITY HERE THIS INFORMS US. AND THEN WE USE OUR OUR FEE STRUCTURE WHICH IS A TEN CENTS PER TRIP. FEET TO CREATE THAT PARKING. AB SO THERE A COUPLE OF THINGS ONE- THE EFFORT IS FOR US TO BETTER RESPOND TO OUR RESIDENTS. WE HAVE HAD ABOUT FIFTEEN HUNDRED CALLS IN THE LAST FOUR MONTHS THROUGH OUR THREE ONE ONE SYSTEM. FOR OF DEVICES THAT ARE BLOCKING SIDEWALKS THAT WERE IMPROPERLY PARK THOSE SORTS OF THINGS- WE HAVE ISSUED SEVENTEEN HUNDRED CITATIONS AND WARNINGS IN THE LAST TWO MONTHS TO OUR OPERATORS FOR. BLOCKED PASSAGE TRAVEL WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO THESE ISSUES. BUT THIS AGAIN AS RAMS IS POINTED OUT. THIS IS A NEW WORLD THAT WE ARE WORKING AND WE STILL DON'T REALLY KNOW. WHAT THAT WORLD OPENS UP TO US WE DON'T WANT TO BE HAMPERED IN TOO MUCH BUT WE DEFINITELY HAVE PUT FORWARD PROBABLY MOST IMPORTANTLY. THEY NEED FOR CONSUMER PRIVACY- IT'S AT THE FOREFRONT OF WHAT WE DO SO WE- AGGREGATE THE DATA. THE DATA IS ON. HOLD THAT IS NOT PUBLIC SO I. FROM MY I PAD HERE. CONNECT TO THAT DATA IT'S NOT PUBLICLY AVAILABLE ITS INTERNAL TO THE CITY ONLY. A SELECT NUMBER PEOPLE THE CITY HAVE ACCESS TO THAT DATA- BUT THE DATE IS GOING TO HELP US SUPPORT NEW WAYS MOBILITY OF CITY SACRAMENTO DOES NOT LIMIT THE NUMBER OF OPERATORS WE DON'T LIMIT THE NUMBER OF DEVICES. AND AT NEW MOBILITY COMES BIRD WE WELCOME IT WE WENT. RIGID BECAUSE REALLY. WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TOWARDS A FUTURE WHERE FEWER PEOPLE ARE DRIVING BY THE- ELVES. AND FOLKS ARE TRAVELING BY OTHER MEANS. I'M SORRY LOOK FORWARD TO YOU CAME WITH. YOUR CITIES I'M OF. COURSE. THANK YOU. FOR THOSE US WHO. HAS IT THE CAP. IN MY WE COULD TOLL TO THEIR- VISA. HAS RISEN ALL ON THE ROAD. ALL RIGHT OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS DAVE ALICE IN THE HE IS OF THE- VICE. OF DATA FOR BIRD GOOD AFTERNOON. THANK YOU AND GOOD AFTERNOON. SO IT'S AN HONOR TO BE HERE TODAY AND THANK YOU AGAIN VERY MUCH FOR INVITING US OUT TO THE PANEL- SO AGAIN I'M DAVID ALSO THEN THE SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF DATA AND ALSO A PICKLE CITY SOLUTIONS A BIRD WHICH IS HOW WE INTERACT WITH CITY GOVERNMENTS- BIRD REALLY IS THE BUSINESS THAT FOUNDED THE MODERN. MICROBIOLOGY SHARED INDUSTRY AND BIRD IS PROUD TO CALL THIS GREAT STATE HOME I'M REALLY PLEASED TO SEE CALIFORNIA BE BUT NAY ON KEY POLICY AREAS SUCH LITTLE PRIVACY AND DATA PRIVACY. AND I BELIEVE THAT THE REASON THAT WE ARE ALL HERE TODAY ULTIMATELY IS BECAUSE OF OUR SHARED VISION TO PROVIDE CLEAN SAFE TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS TO RESIDENTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THIS CHAIRED QUEEN TRANSPORTATION OFFERING SUCH AS BIRDS EAST CREATORS HAVE ALREADY DONE A LOT OF GOOD IN CALIFORNIA. THE THOUSANDS OF JOBS THAT HELP MILLIONS OF RESIDENTS GO TO SCHOOL AND TO WORK. AND THEY PREVENTED A MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF CO TWO FROM ENTERING THE ATMOSPHERE. IN FACT MORE THAN HALF OF ALL OF BIRD RIGHTS KANSI TRIPS THAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED ON A CAR OR A RIDE HAILING SERVICE SUCH AS UBER LEFT. OUR BUSINESS THRIVES WHEN CITY STILL. AND WE WORK BEST IN COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE THE SAME SHARED VISION AS WE DO OF STREETS THAT ARE FILLED WITH PEDESTRIANS AND BY EX IN EAST HOOTERS. INSTEAD OF CARS AND SMOG. AND ULTIMATELY THAT'S WHY WE'VE PLACED OUR CITY PARTNERSHIPS AT THE CORE OF OUR BUSINESS. AS ANY MARRIAGE WOULD TELL YOU A STRONG PARTNERSHIP REQUIRES OPEN COMMUNICATION TO SUCCEED. AND IT'S WHY WE BELIEVE IN BEING TRANSPARENT WITH THEIR DATA. SO TO SHOW YOU HOW SERIOUS WE ARE IN OUR COMMITMENT TO IMPROVING CITIES IN PURSUING ARCHER POLICY GOALS WE REALLY ULTIMATELY NEED TO START FROM THE SAME FACTS AND MEASURE THE EXACT SAME OUTCOMES. AND TO BE CANDID THIS DECISION IS NOT ONE THAT WE MADE LIGHTLY OUR APPROACH TO DATA REQUIRES- ENORMOUS INVESTMENT AND RESOURCES. TO BE ABLE TO GATHER HANDLE SECURING PROTECTION DELIVER THAT DATA TO A CITY PARTNER. WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY PROVIDING THEM WITH THE TOOLS THAT THEY NEED TO CROP REGULATIONS AND ENSURE COMPLIANCE. AND IT'S A COMMITMENT THE REQUIRES A LOT OF DEDICATED RESOURCES PEOPLE AND FINANCIAL. FAN EXPERIENCE TO DELIVER. AT OUR CORE THOUGH WE BELIEVE THAT EVERYONE COULD SEE FOR THEMSELVES THE POSITIVE SOCIETAL ECOLOGICAL IMPACT OR MAKING EVERY SINGLE DAY IN OUR CITY PARTNERS CENTER CITIES- YOU KNOW THE BAY YOU WOULD SEE AB EXACT SAME THING THAT WE DO WHICH IS THE POTENTIAL TO TRANSFORM CALIFORNIA CITIES FOR THE BETTER. WE'VE SEEN THIS PLAY OUT IN OUR HOMETOWN OF SANTA MONICA WERE BIRD PROVIDES THE CITY WITH THE DATA THAT IT NEEDS TO BUILD OUT ITS MAKER MODEL OF THE NETWORK. AND THIS IS RESULTED ALREADY IN PARKING INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS AND MANY OTHER IMPROVEMENTS. SANTA MONICA HAS A GOAL OF SHIFTING WALKING AND MICRO ABILITY SUCH AS THESE SCOOTERS. AND AS MY COLLEAGUE EDFU SAID TO THIS PANEL SEVERAL MONTHS AGO WHEN HE ADDRESSED IT- THE KEY REASONS THAT PEOPLE DON'T USE MY CREDIBILITY ARE REALLY RUN INFRASTRUCTURE THE LACK OF INFRASTRUCTURE. COST AND AVAILABILITY. AND DATA SHARING WITH US CITY PARTNER LIKE SANTA MONICA. HELPS IS ACTUALLY ACHIEVE THEIR GOAL OF MODE SHIFT. SO THAT TO US IS ULTIMATELY THE PROMISE OF THIS PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP. WE KNOW THAT UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES NON AYE RELATED DATA CAN POSE PRIVACY CONCERNS AND WE THINK THOSE ARE LEGITIMATE. WE TAKE THE PRIVACY OF WRITER DATA VERY VERY SERIOUSLY AND WE INVEST INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF TIME AND MONEY. INTO DATA MANAGEMENT INFRASTRUCTURE IN TECHNICAL SECURITY. WE RESTRICT WHO CAN SEE WHAT DATA INTERNALLY AND WE HAVE EXTENSIVE POLICIES ON HOW WE SURE IT EXTERNALLY. THESE PRIVACY CONCERNS ARE ONLY EXACERBATED BY THE UNCLEAR PATCHWORK OF LAW AROUND THE COUNTRY THAT MANY OTHERS HAVE ALREADY REFERRED TO TODAY. WE'RE PROUD THAT THE CALIFORNIA STATE LEGISLATURE IS ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES AND IS LED THE NATION PROTECTING THE PRIVACY OF ITS CITIZENS. AND APPRECIATE THE LEGISLATURE LOOKING TO IMPROVE THAT CLARITY OVERTIME. A BLUNT APPROACH WOULD BE TO TREAT CITIES LIKE WE TREAT ANY OTHER DATA PARTNER AND NOT SHARE THIS REAL TIME NON I AGREE TO DATE WITH THEM. CITIES WOULD STILL GET SOME AGGREGATED DATA FOR RESEARCH IN URBAN PLANNING PURPOSES PLUS HAVE THE ABILITY TO ENFORCE COMPLIANCE WILL GREATLY REDUCING PRIVACY RESTS. IT IS IN FACT HOW CALIFORNIA'S EXISTING DATA LAWS APPLY TO MOST TECH COMPANIES. BUT WE ARE A CLEAN TRANSPORTATION COMPANY THAT USES TECHNOLOGY TO DELIVER A CRITICAL SERVICE FOR COMMUNITIES MOBILITY. WE THINK THE RIGHT PATH HERE IS A BIT MORE NUANCE IT'S A MORE TARGETED AND FLEXIBLE APPROACH ONE THE CONSIDERS IMPORTANCE OF LOCAL AUTONOMY AND LEAVES ROOM FOR INNOVATION THAT WOULD ALLOW CITIES AND TRANSPORTATION COMPANIES LIKE US TO BUILD A BETTER FUTURE FOR CLEAN TRANSPORTATION CALIFORNIA. WITH THE POWER OF THE PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP THAT ARE REFERRED TO. AND SHOULD THE STATE WANT TO TAKE A MORE MEASURED APPROACH YOU CAN DO SO BY SETTING UP PRINCIPLES IT WANTS TO ACHIEVE. FOR EXAMPLE NO PERSONS LOCATION HISTORY SHOULD BE IDENTIFIABLE FROM ANYTHING PUBLICLY AVAILABLE. RAW DATA SHOULD BE TIGHTLY SECURED WITH RESTRICTIONS ON WHO CAN ACCESS IT. AND LAW ENFORCEMENT SHOULDN'T HAVE ACCESS WITHOUT APPROPRIATE LEGAL PROCESS. ARMED WITH THOSE PRINCIPLES WE BELIEVE THAT WE CAN WORK WITH CITIES ACADEMICS AND THE STATE TO DEVELOP A SET OF DATA SHARING STANDARDS. THAT ULTIMATELY CAN EVOLVE AS THE SPACE OF BALLS AND APPLY EQUALLY TO BOTH TRANSPORTATION OPERATORS AND TO CITIES WE THINK THAT'S A REALLY REALLY CRITICAL COMPONENT. IF YOU WANT TO LOOK OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA THERE ARE OTHER EXAMPLES MANY CITIES THAT COULD SERVE AS A MODEL FOR THIS KIND OF DATA SHARING BUT CHICAGO AND I'M HAPPY TO SPEAK TO THAT DURING QUESTIONING. WE'VE ALSO PREPARED SOME HANDOUTS. BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS. RATHER THAN DRAWING A BRIGHT LINE INTO WHAT CITIES CAN AND CANNOT SEE AND RECEIVE. WE SUPPORT FOCUSING ON GOVERNANCE. PRINCIPLES AND SECURITY THAT WILL PROTECT RESIDENTS BUSINESSES AND GOVERNMENTS ALIKE. AT THE END OF THE DAY WE DON'T SEE THIS AS AN ADVERSARIAL PROCESS. WE BELIEVE A PATH FORWARD. IS CLEAR AND IT ALLOWS US TO BE TRANSPARENT WITH OUR CITY PARTNERS AND ACCOMPLISH OUR SHARED POLICY GOALS. OF PROTECTING WRITER PRIVACY. ALSO REDUCING CAR USED TO TRAFFICKING CARBON EMISSIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M FOR. SURE THEY'LL BE A QUESTION OR TWO- IN YOU MIGHT KEEP ONE IN MIND WHICH IS. HOW WHAT INFORMATION YOU DECIDE TO COLLECT AND TO YOU ADVICE THE USER OF YOUR- TRANSPORTATION MECHANISMS. WITH THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT. SO IF THE AND WE'LL GET TO THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE OUR LAST SPEAKER LAST BUT CERTAINLY NOT LEAST JAMIE LEE WILLIAMS WHO IS A STAFF ATTORNEY WITH THE ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION I'VE- WORKED CLOSELY WITH THE- YOUR ORGANIZATION IN THE PAST AND KNOW THAT YOU ARE. STRONG PRIVACY ADVOCATES SO WE'LL LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING WHICH HAVE TO SAY GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU AND GOOD AFTERNOON. AS YOU SAID I AM JEANNIE WILLIAMS ON A STAFF ATTORNEY AT THE ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION WHICH IS A DIGITAL RIGHTS NONPROFIT BASE HERE IN CALIFORNIA- HERE WITH ME TODAY IS MY COLLEAGUE BENNETT CIPHERS ONE OF OUR STAFF TECHNOLOGISTS OF THERE'S- TECHNICAL QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE DURING THE PANEL WE HAVE BEEN HERE- SO WE ARE HERE TODAY TO HIGHLIGHT THE NEED FOR LEGISLATION THAT LIMITS LOCAL AGENCIES TO. AGGREGATE AND DE IDENTIFIED TRIP DATA INTO PREVENT GOVERNMENTS FROM UNNECESSARILY STOCKPILING SENSITIVE LOCATION DATA ABOUT RESIDENTS. AS YOU HAVE HEARD TODAY EVEN WITH NAME STRIPPED OUT DATA RELATING TO INTERPRET INDIVIDUAL TRIPS ON SHARED MOBILITY DEVICES IS INCREDIBLY SENSITIVE DATA. IS THE LOCATION DATA THAT PERTAINS TO THE PERSON MOVEMENTS OF REAL PEOPLE REAL TIME OR NOT EITHER A VERY SENSITIVE. YET LOCAL TRANSPORTATION PLAYING AGENCIES ACROSS THE STATE ARE CURRENTLY DEMANDING THAT OPERATORS PROVIDE ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION AS A CONDITION OF GETTING A PERMIT TO OPERATE WITHIN THEIR JURISDICTIONS AND THEY'RE HOPING. TO TRANSPORT THIS WHOLE PLAN TO OTHER FORMS OF TRANSPORTATION TO GET THE SAME TYPES OF DATA FOR EVERY EVERY TYPE OF TRANSPORTATION ON THE STREETS- THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES MAKING THESE DEMANDS ARE NOT. BOUNCING THEY'RE PLANNING GOALS WITH THE PRIVACY INTERESTS OF THE RESIDENTS AND THEY DO NOT EVEN SEEM TO BELIEVE. THAT TRIP DATA. IS PERSONAL INFORMATION IN A LETTER OPPOSING A. B. ELEVEN TWELVE CENTS LAST JUNE FIVE CALIFORNIA CITIES ARGUED THAT REMOVING CUSTOMER IDENTIFIERS LIKE NAMES SHOULD BE ENOUGH TO PROTECT WRITER PRIVACY. BUT HUMAN MOBILITY PATTERNS ARE HIGHLY UNIQUE AND THAT MAKES ANONYMIZING LOCATION DATA AND TORY SLEEP DIFFICULT TECHNICAL TASK THE STUDY CHAU REMOVING IS NOT ENOUGH TO PROTECT PRIVACY. THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES DEMANDING INDIVIDUAL TRIP DATA ARE FAILING TO COMPLY WITH EXISTING PROTECTIONS IN THE LAW. SPECIFICALLY THEIR FAILING TO COMPLY WITH THE ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS PRIVACY ACT AS WE'VE HEARD. THEIR BILLING TO COMPLY WITH THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO PRIVACY WHICH PREVENTS GOVERNMENTS FROM COLLECTING AND STOCKPILING UNNECESSARY INFORMATION ABOUT US. AND FROM IS USING INFORMATION THAT'S COLLECTED FROM ONE PURPOSE AND USED FOR ANOTHER PURPOSE HERE YOU OFTEN HAVE NO IDEA WHAT USE CASES THEY'RE COLLECTING THE STATE OF FORCES NO WAY TO EVEN ENFORCE THIS. THAT OUR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO PRIVACY HERE IN CALIFORNIA- AND THEY'RE FEELING COMPLY WITH THE U. S. SUPREME COURT'S HOLDING IN CARPENTER REESE'S UNITED STATES WHICH RECOGNIZE THAT LOCATION DATA IS INCREDIBLY SENSITIVE PERSONAL INFORMATION. PROTECTED BY THE FOURTH AMENDMENT REASONABLE EXPECTATION OF PRIVACY. CENTER JACKSON YOU MENTIONED EARLIER TODAY THE RECKLESS DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE TODAY IS THE RECKLESS STOCKPILING OF INFORMATION BY GOVERNMENTS WHAT WE NEED. FROM THE LEGISLATOR ARE CLEAR GUARD RAILS THAT PLACE GRANULAR ROCKCHIP DATA OFF LIMITS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES. BY LIMITING LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO AGGREGATE ANTI IDENTIFY TRIP DATA NOT JUST DATA WITH THE NAME STRIPPED OUT. AND SUCH GUARDRAILS ARE NECESSARY TO PROTECT THE PRIVACY INTERESTS OF CALIFORNIANS INTO SENT A CLEAR SIGNAL TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT THEY ARE NOT BEYOND THE LAW. AND I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR WE DO NOT THINK THE STATE SHOULD BE CUT OFF FROM ALL DATA WHATSOEVER NO ONE HERE TODAY IS SAYING THAT. WE AGREE THAT LOCAL AGENCIES SHOULD BE ABLE TO COLLECT SOME DATA IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT NEW TRANSPORTATION DEVICES ARE DEPLOYED SAFELY. EFFICIENTLY SUSTAINABLY AND EQUITABLY. BUT LOCAL AGENCIES DO NOT NEED TO COLLECT INDIVIDUAL FRAUGHT TRIP DATA. ABOUT PEOPLE IN ORDER TO DO SO THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO USE AGGREGATE AND DE IDENTIFIED DATA. AND THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE BECAUSE THE CITIES HAVE NOT SHOWN THAT THEY ACTUALLY NEED INDIVIDUAL TRIP LATER I HAVE THE LUCKY POSITION OF BEING THE LAST ONE TO SPEAK TODAY WE HAVE NOT HEARD A SINGLE. USE CASE THAT WOULD NECESSITATE INDIVIDUAL FRAUD DATA THERE'S BEEN A COUPLE OF THINGS ARE MENTIONED. SUCH AS- ENTERING THE VERACITY OF DATA THERE ARE TECHNOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS THAT SOLVE FOR THIS WE ARE A MODERN STATE LET'S USE A MODERN TECHNOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS IS SOMETHING. THAT THAT WOULD BE HAPPY TO TALK MORE ABOUT. I HEARD ABOUT. PLAN NEEDS IT PEACE BUT ALSO HEARD THAT THE KEY THINGS THAT WERE LOW FORWARD TO TALKING THAT. PATTERNS WHERE PEOPLE ARE GOING IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER WHERE I GO THE KEY IS WHERE MOST PEOPLE ARE GOING AND THERE'S WAYS TO MAKE SURE THAT CITIES HAVE THE DATA THAT THEY NEED. AN AGGREGATE WAY- THE OTHER OTHER. USE CASES THAT WERE MENTIONED WERE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT PEOPLE'S PREFERENCES ARE BUT IT SEEMS FROM. FROM THE TESTIMONY TODAY THAT SURVEYS ARE GOING TO BE THE MOST WAY THE BEST WAY TO GET THAT YOU GET THAT INFORMATION- AND THEN ALSO ENFORCING SCOOTER CAPS MAKING SURE THAT THERE'S NOT TOO MANY SCOOTERS IN VENICE BEACH. THAT YOU CAN GET WITH- INDIVIDUAL LEVEL DATA THAT'S NOT PERTAINING TO TRIPS BUT WE'RE SCOOTERS ARE PARKING AND WE HAVE NO PROBLEM. WITH CITIES GETTING ACCESS TO INDIVIDUAL DATA WHEN IT'S NOT A TRIP DATA SO WHERE SCOOTERS ARE PARKED TO ENFORCE PARKING LIMITS. CAPS EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION ANYTHING LIKE THAT COMPLETELY FINE WITH THAT. BUT WHEN CITIES START THEM OUT AND I THINK IT'S TELLING WITH SACRAMENTO IS DOING WITH- WITH AGREEABLE DATA THAT WAS GREAT TO HEAR I WASN'T. SUPER AWARE OF WHAT'S ACKERMAN TO WAS DOING BUT IT BUT IT WAS. GREAT TO HEAR ALL THE GREAT USE CASES THAT THEY'RE DOING WITH AGGREGATE DATA BUT WHEN CITY START DEMANDED DEMANDING INDIVIDUAL LEVEL TRIP DATA WE'RE NO LONGER TALKING ABOUT SMART CITIES WE ARE TALKING ABOUT SURVEILLANCE CITY'S. TURNING OUR CITIES INTO SURVEILLANCE CITIES IS NOT NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE THE LAUDABLE PLANNING GOALS THAT TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES ACROSS THE STATE ARE WORKING TOWARDS WHAT WE NEED ARE SMART ENOUGH. CITIES CITIES THAT HARNESS THE POWER OF TECHNOLOGY AND DATA IN A WAY THAT PROTECTS THE PRIVACY INTERESTS OF ALL CALIFORNIANS WE CAN HAVE A BEAUTIFUL CITIES WITHOUT HAVING SURVEILLANCE CITIES. AND WHAT WE NEED TO GET THERE ARE CLEAR LIMITS FROM YOU LEGISLATOR THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- THAT CONCLUDES THE- PANEL I JUST HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS AND- IF THERE ANY OTHERS AND THEN WHAT WE'LL DO IS- INVITE PUBLIC COMMENT FOR NO MORE THAN TWO MINUTES EACH- AND WE ALREADY HAVE OUR- PUBLIC COMMENTERS. READY TO ROLL- BUT- I JUST HAD A COUPLE QUESTIONS- ACCEPTING THE PREMISE THAT WE- CAN AND SHOULD BE USING DATA- TO ASSIST US IT SEEMS THAT THE QUESTION IS TO WHAT LIMIT WHAT DATA DO WE NEED- TO ACCOMPLISH THE GOAL THAT WE ARE TRYING TO ACHIEVE- AND I'D LIKE TO OPEN THIS UP VERY BRIEFLY FOR IT HOW DO WE GO ABOUT THAT ALLEN SINK WHAT ARE THE RIGHT QUESTIONS THAT WE SHOULD BE ASKING. AND WHAT SHOULD WE AS POLICY MAKERS WE PASS THE CPA- THERE I KNOW GOING TO BE A BUNCH OF BILLS IS HERE THAT ARE COMING FORWARD THAT ARE. GOING TO TRY TO. DO SOME TWEAKING OR SIGNIFICANT CHANGES OR WHAT HAVE YOU- I WOULD LIKE TO. GET JUST IF WE WERE TO ASK A FEW QUESTIONS UNDERSTANDING THAT WE HAVE TO BALANCE THIS UNDERSTANDING PERHAPS THAT DE AGGREGATING- IS THE LAST RESORT. BECAUSE OF A AND OF COURSE OF FEAR THAT EVEN IF WE AGGREGATED SOMEONE CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO DE AGGREGATED BUT- HOW DO WEACHIEVE THE GOALS. ARE THAT WE'RE SEEKING BOTH IN TERMS OF TRADE OUR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM AND YET PROTECTING PRIVACY. BECAUSE PRIVACY IS THAT A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA I KNOW I TALK ABOUT THIS FREQUENTLY IT'S WRITTEN RIGHT INTO OUR CONSTITUTION. SO WE HAVE A DUTY TO PROTECT THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT HOW DO WE DO THAT AND A PERHAPS A MISTER ELSON WILL START WITH YOU FROM A BIRD BECAUSE CITED SORT OF GIVE YOU A HEADS UP ON THAT. BEFORE YOU DO THAT SO I WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR SO THERE'S NO. MISSION STEVE DELAY FROM THE- OFFICE OF THE LA CITY ATTORNEY SANTA MONICA CITY ATTORNEY AN OFFICER OF SAN JOSE THE CITY ATTORNEY- DURING THE COURSE OF THIS PROCEEDING SO I AM THIS COULD COUNTY- WHEN I SUGGESTED YOU MIGHT COMMENT ON IT I WAS NOT AWARE THAT YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS AND APPARENTLY WAS JUST DELIVERED. TO THE- LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL TO MS BORDER FIND DURING THIS HEARING- NOT A GOOD PLAN- THIS IS NOT THE WAY WE SHOULD BE DOING BUSINESS HERE SO- MY APOLOGIES IF I SUGGESTED TO YOU OR ANYONE THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN PREPARED TO ANSWER THIS- HOPE THAT WE WILL HAVE THE- OPPORTUNITY AS WE SHOULD. TO LOOK AT THIS CAREFULLY. I WANT TO PRACTICE LAW WHEN PEOPLE WOULD HAND. DOCUMENTS TO THE COURT AT THE VERY LAST MOMENT OR WHEN WE STEPPED INTO THE COURTROOM- I FOUND MYSELF REALLY QUITE UNHAPPY WITH THAT PROCESS I CONSIDERED TO BE SHARP PRACTICE. I HOPE THAT THAT WAS THE INTENT OF THESE THREE CITY ATTORNEYS BECAUSE IT DOESN'T SIT WELL WITH ME. SO WITH THAT OF COULD YOU START MISTER OLSON VERY BRIEFLY MAYBE A THIRTY SECOND JUST TO HELP SORT OF GIVE US SOME PARAMETERS. SURE THANK YOU SO MUCH AGAIN FOR YOUR QUESTION AND THANK YOU TEARS FOR INCLUDING US IN THIS PANEL- SO I THINK THE WAY THAT I WOULD LOOK AT THIS PROBLEM AND I WOULD BE CURIOUS ALSO ABOUT- DOCTOR BISHOPS RECOMMENDATIONS HERE BUT I THINK ABOUT THE DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS. THAT WE YOU KNOW THAT WE LOOK AT THE DATA SO THINGS LIKE THE RETENTION PERIOD HOW LONG IS THE DATA RETAINED BY THE GROUP THAT'S CONSUMING IT A RECEIVING IT RIGHT. I ALSO THINK ABOUT THINGS LIKE ACCESS CONTROL SO WHO HAS ACCESS AND WHAT ARE THE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS. THIS ALL BOILS DOWN TO A THEME THAT YOU'VE HEARD FROM MANY MANY IDENTIFYING USE CASES. IF WE GO BACK TO OTHER DIMENSIONS THE MATTER GRANULARITY OF THE DATA OR THE LEVEL OF AGGREGATION THAT SUPPLY IS ALL WRITTEN ICAL. I BISHOP. TO OKAY. SORRY SO THINGS WELL. I'M ASIAN LEVELS AS WELL AS OTHER TECH. THAT HAVE. YOU KNOW REMARK ON BY A- MEMBERS OF THIS PANEL. THE OTHER PANEL. OUR EGGS. THE TECHNIQUES ONE WOULD USE. TO PROTECT. IN THESE CASES. FRANKLY WE'VE PREPARED A NUMBER OF HAND OUTS AND WE FINDS THAT. TO DATE SIX PRINCIPLES AND THEN THREE. PRACTICES AND- ALL ALL REITERATE WHAT I SAID DURING MY TESTIMONY- THIS DOESN'T NEED TO BE ADVERSARIAL PROCESS I THINK ACTUALLY EVERYONE HERE WOULD APPRECIATE. YOU KNOW THE APPROPRIATE LEGISLATION ENACTED- THE KEY ISSUES REALLY DO SURROUND THOSE. DIMENSIONS AND PROP THERE ARE SOME OTHER KEY TO ME. AS WELL SO IF YOU'D MAKE SURE IF WE HAVEN'T. RECEIVED ASSEMBLY GET THIS THAT. ABSENT ANYONE ELSE WISH TO COMMENT. BUT RESUMES YEAH I'LL I MEAN I'LL JUST IT WHEN IT TO DATA WHICH WE- HAVE A LAW THAT PROTECTS THE STATE A IT'S CAL ACT. AND I THINK WE COULD HAVE ANOTHER WE AND WE ANOTHER LAW LIMITING AS I SAID CITIES TO AGGREGATE AND DE IDENTIFIED DATA WOULD. SEND A CLEAR SIGNAL TO THE CITY IS THAT THAT WAS THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATOR AND THE STATE IS OFF LIMITS TO YOU FOR THE- AND THERE'S A IF YOU WANT IT THERE'S CERTAIN PROCESSES THAT OUT AND COLLECT BUT- YOU CAN GET. IS A SUBPOENA PERCENT EXISTING LAW. AT. WHAT THAT'S THE LAW THE PERTHE STATE I WENT COMES. AGGREGATE DATA I THINK A LAW THAT. BROADLY LIMIT CITIES TO THE MOST SENSITIVE DATA AND THEN ALLOWS THEM WITHIN THAT TO WORK WITH WHATEVER DAY THAT THEY MIGHT WANT TO ASK FOR- I THINK THAT WOULD BE A GOOD WAY OF ALLOWING INNOVATION WILL ALSO PROTECTING PRIVACY THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENTS. MR MINU. I WORKING THERE WE GO YEAH OUR FIRST STORY VERY MUCH FOR THE LETTER COMING IN SO LATE- THAT IS A SNAFU IN TERMS OF GETTING SIGNATURES FROM VARIOUS ATTORNEYS TOGETHER IT WAS CERTAINLY NOT MEANT IN ANY WAY WE DID NOT EXPECT YOU TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO IT SO QUICKLY. I CAN SPEAK TO THAT IN A SECOND BUT- WE ALSO BELIEVE THE ENUMERATED USES- DIRECTION IS GOOD. I DON'T THINK IT THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT WHICH IS CLOSE DOWN ACCESS TO DISAGGREGATED DATA IS GOOD ALSO I THINK THAT THAT IT'S PRECLUDING. THE ABILITY- TO POTENTIALLY A FOR SOME VERY GOOD POTENTIAL USES- WE DO NEED A SEGREGATED. ALREADY IN TERMS OF THAT REST STATE FOR DEVICES- WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO. VERIFY THAT. NAM AND WE CAN'T DO IT WITHOUT THAT- ALSO. LIKE WE ALSO WANT ROUTE DATA DISAGGREGATED TO BE ABLE TO MEASURE- SERVICE LEVELS IN. INCOME AREAS- WHERE WE HAD A LOWER POINT WE ALSO. WANT MEASURE WHERE WRITERS PREFER- TO GO- SO THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE WE'RE- WE'RE STANDING- UP WHERE WE SHOULD. BE PAYING A NEW. STRUCTURE NOW. THE ABOUT THAT VARIOUS. BAG IN THE SECOND. IN THAT. I DON'T THINK IT'S A VERY CLEAN. I THINK THERE'S A. STRAY IN AND STRONG WAS TO SAY WE DON'T WANT THIS DISAGGREGATED A OUT THERE. MY GUNS IN BUT IT'S A VERY REASONABLE POSITION TO TAKE BUT I THINK WHEN WE REALLY LOOK AT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH THIS DATA. TAKING AWAY THAT ABILITY IS GOING TO HARM THE PUBLIC GOOD WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING AND WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND. WHAT HAPPENED AS WELL AS AS THINGS ARE COMING AS I WAS SAYING EARLIER WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO START WORKING WITH THE COMPANIES THEY'RE PROVIDING SERVICE- AND THOSE SERVICES WILL BE DONE IN DISAGGREGATED FORM. AND WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO OPERATE WITHOUT. THANK YOU ANY OTHER THOUGHTS. PART OF MISTER MISS WARRANT THANK YOU CHAIR I THINK THERE ARE. A THEIR DID THERE'S A NEED FOR AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT DATA NEEDS AGGREGATED VERSUS NOT WHAT'S NOT FOR EXAMPLE IS RAMS IS TALKED ABOUT. DEVICES THAT ARE PART NOT MOVING NOW I PARTY DEVICE BUT IT IS DEPLOYED OR IT IS PARKED DOES NOT NEED TO BE AGREED IT'S NOT RELATED TO A PERSON. AND THAT'S HOW WE COLLECT DATA ON REQUIRE. PERCENT OF OUR DEVICES GO TO OUR LOW INCOME AREAS OR THAT THEY ARE DEPLOYED TO TRANSIT LOCATIONS OR- ALMOST. FIVE HUNDRED PRICES AND THEY ACTUALLY HAVE A THOUSAND DEVICES THT SORT OF PERMISSION DOES NOT NEED TO BE ACCURATE IS NOT RELATED TO A TRIP AND I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US. AS STEWARDS OF THEIR WAY TO IT THAT. WHEN A QUICKLY CLARIFIED I'D SAY. AFTER DID I AM AN AGGREGATE TRIPPED NOT ALL DATA. AND I MEAN I THINK I THINK ALSO I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT THESE BECAUSE I THINK IT WOULD BE POTENTIALLY USEFUL TO. TO FORCE EVERY CALIFORNIAN TO WEAR. ANKLE MONITOR TO MAKE SURE WE COULD SEE WHERE THEY WENT AT ALL TIMES. BUT THERE HAVE TO BE LIMITS. DATA THAT WE GET ABOUT WHERE PEOPLE ARE GOING- AND I MEAN. IT'S NOT ONLY ME SAYING THAT THE SUPREME COURT HAS RECOGNIZED THAT LOCATION DATE IS HIGHLY SENSITIVE DATA THIS. RAISES SERIOUS CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTIONS WHEN CITIES ARE FORCING- OPERATORS TO TURN OVER ACCESS TO THE STATE A ANSEL. REASONABLE LIMITS THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO PLAN FOR THE BENEFIT OF ALL OF US WHILE ALSO PROTECTING OUR PRIVACY SINCE. SINCE ALL THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE BENEFIT OF CALIFORNIANS. THAT'S THAT IS THE APPROPRIATE BALANCING TEST AND THAT IS THE ROLE OF THE LEGISLATURE THANK YOU. I COULD DO YOU HAVE A QUESTION I DO HAVE. MORE YEAH. YOU HAVE ONE QUESTION AGAIN. IN YOU DON'T HAS HAVE TO. CONSENT KNOWLEDGE. SHOULD A WRITER OF ONE OF THESE VEHICLES KNOW THAT THEIR INFORMATION IS BEING TRACKED OR- OBTAINED WHILE THEY ARE. ON THESE VEHICLES AND SHOULD THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT I MEAN IT DOES. I USED TO BE A BIG FAN OF OPTING IN BUT- AT LEAST MAYBE AT SOME POINT PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO KNOW WHAT'S THAT THAT WHEN THEY TAKE THIS TRIP. THAT THERE THAT IT'S BEING MONITORED AND POTENTIALLY DE AGGREGATE I MEAN THE PERSONALIZED SO THE PEOPLE KNOW WHO WHO WHO IS WHO IT IS IT'S TAKING THIS TRIP FOR WHERE THEY'RE GOING FROM POINT A WHICH MAY BE THEIR HOME. WITH A CORNER OF THE STREET. TO THE PLACE WHERE THEY WORK SHOULD PEOPLE HAVE THE ABILITY TO KNOW THAT DATE YOU ARE COLLECTING INFORMATION AND THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT. YES GREAT HOW ABOUT YOU SIR. ALL ECHO THE SAME POSITION- WE ACTUALLY PROVIDE DISABILITY TODAY AND WE ALSO PROVIDE THIS- THIS NOTIFICATION AS WELL SO I THINK FUNDAMENTALLY LOOK WE IT IS IN OUR BEST INTEREST TO PROTECT WRITER PRIVACY AND TO ENSURE THAT ANY CUSTOMER OF OURS HAS THEIR DATA EXTREMELY WELL PROTECTED RIGHT AND IS EXACTLY FOR THAT REASON THAT WE ALLOW IN JURISDICTIONS WHERE YOU KNOW IT'S HARD SUCH AS CALIFORNIA AND TO BE. THE BILL FOR USER TO OPT OUT OF DATA COLLECTION IN THIS WAY THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS THIS SENATOR BILL- ENTER SO THE LEGALIZATION SPARRING. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO KIND OF. CLEAR FIVE WHAT THE VARIOUS POSITIONS OF VARIOUS GROUPS ARE- WE HAVE OUR LAWYER HERE ARE LAWYER OF YOUR PERCENT US AND OUR LAWYER- MADE A CLEAR STATEMENT TO ME. IN HER MEMO THAT WAS WRITTEN. BACK IN. WITH THE FALL OF LAST YEAR OKAY AND THEN. YEAH WE RECEIVE THIS LETTER TODAY BUT THERE'S BEEN OTHER LETTERS AS WELL ABOUT THAT THE YOU KNOW CONTRAVENING THE- LETTER THAT WAS WRITTEN THE LEGAL COUNSEL'S OPINION. SO I THINK IS YOU KNOW LIKE YOU SAID I THINK WE NEED A THEY COULD SPLURGE. FIND OUT. WHAT THE RESPONSE WOULD BE YOU KNOW. YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT LETTERS BEEN SUBMITTED YOU KNOW THAT'S SO. TOO BAD- THAT THE CITY OF SAN JOSE DO IT BECAUSE- THAT'S MY CITY AND- IS TOO BAD BECAUSE I'M GOING TO BE MEETING WITH THE MAYOR FRIDAY I'LL BRING IT UP. HE'S ASKING ME FOR A BUNCH OF MONEY SO YOU KNOW. GOOD TIMING YOU KNOW. SO YOU KNOW YOU KNOW YOU KNOW YOU KNOW YOU GUYS ARE EVERY TIME I MEET WITH THE MAYOR YOU ALWAYS WANT SOMETHING RIGHT. YOU KNOW MAYOR RIGHT THIS IS WHAT THEY DO NOW. SO I AM INTERESTED IN. FROM THIS PANEL OF. CONTROLLED STUDIES OF FOR ACADEMIC PURPOSES THIS ACADEMIC PURPOSE ISSUE OF. IN TERMS OF GETTING INFORMATION UNDER CONTROL- HIGHLY CONTROLLED MANNER. OF WHAT IS YOUR OPINION ABOUT. A PROCESS THAT COULD BE ESTABLISHED TO DO THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. OF AND IS IT. AN ACADEMIC STUDY ON US ON. FOR VARIOUS REASONS THAT MIGHT BE PERTINENT TO TRANSPORTATION THE GOALS THAT WE HAVE- IN IN TERMS OF SOME KIND OF FIRE WALLS ARE CONTROLS WE CAN PUT ON. ON THOSE KINDS OF STUDIES THAT ORDER. GOING TO BE ATTEMPTED OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS FOR VARIOUS REASONS. CAN YOU COMMENT ON THE ISSUE. I'M I'M SURE OTHERS HAVE INPUT AS WELL BUT I'M I'M HAPPY TO PROVIDE BABY ONE VANTAGE POINT WHICH IS WHAT WE TODAY AS A COMPANY DO- SO WE ENGAGE WITH A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS AND WE HAVE MANY RESEARCH STUDIES THAT HAVE BEEN DONE FOR EXAMPLE IN THE STATE ABILITY OF OUR VEHICLES ARE MODE SHIFTER HOW THEY YOU KNOW- ENABLE EQUITABLE TRANSPORTATION AND CITIES. ON AND FRANKLY- THE WAY WE'VE APPROACHED IT RIGHT NOW IS ACTUALLY QUITE RESTRICTIVE WE ONLY SHARE HIGHLY I REDID FORMS OF DATA- WE TYPICALLY TRIM DOWN ONLY THE EXACT RESEARCH QUESTIONS THAT ARE NEEDED- AND YOU KNOW THE ONE I- SALES THEM- LAST WEEK. HOW DO WE GET MORE TRANSIT RIDERS THE. NEW MOBILITY THAT WE HAVE IN OUR SOCIETY HOW DO WE- RELATE THAT TO GETTING- PEOPLE GET OTHER CARS YOU KNOW WE GOTTA WE'RE DO STARE POLLUTION. ONLY WE HAVE SOME PRIMARY IMPERATIVES HERE IN TERMS OF. YOU KNOW THE CLIMATE CHANGE ISSUE YOU KNOW THAT THAT THIS COULD. HOW DO WE HOW DO WE DO THE BEST JOB WE CAN TO ACCOMMODATE THOSE KINDS OF STUDIES. WITHOUT BREAKING THE LAW OR WITHOUT INTERFERING WITH PRIVACY AND SO FORTH YEAH I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS AND THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE QUESTION YEAH ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE DONE IS A COMPANIES WE'VE ALSO CREATED A TRANSPORTATION PLANNING SERVICES GROUP. ON THAT ASSIST WITH CITY PLANNERS AND WE DON'T NECESSARILY FOR THE SPECIFIC QUESTION THAT YOU ASKED AND REALLY THAT DOT- AREA OF QUESTIONING HOW DO YOU CONVERT- OR HOW DO YOU ENCOURAGE USE OF TRANSIT AND YOU KNOW HOW YOU USE MICROBIOLOGY TWENTY. IS A TRANSIT. IN GENERAL THE WAY WE'VE REACHED. THIS IS NOT. BY THIS. GROUP IS ON OUR GET ORDERED IN. TODAY ON VINCE IT'S LOW AT WE CALL SOURCE IN SIX. AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE WITH MANY OF OUR CITY PARTNERS AS WE LOOK AT THE TRANSIT LINES AND THEN WE LOOK AT WHERE OUR VEHICLES ARE GOING. TO AND WHERE THERE TO PULL. ON AND THEN WE CAN SHOW FOR EXAMPLE THAT MICROVILLI VEHICLES CAN ACTUALLY BE A REALLY GOOD EXTENSION OF EXISTING TRANSIT LINES AND CAN ACTUALLY WIDEN. THE APPLICABILITY OR UTILITY OF THE FUNDS. BUT QUE IN POINT THAT SPECIFIC. THAT YOU ASKED IS A GREAT EXAMPLE HE- CREATED TO UPDATE CAN'T BE PUT. THAT SPECIFIC QUESTION WITHOUT INCOME RIPPING ANY USER'S PRIVACY OR YOU KNOW- REVEALING ANY INDIVISIBLE PERSON. THAT ARE ARE A- LANCE AND OTHER USE CASE THAT HAVE BEEN YOU KNOW DISC BY SOME OF OUR CITY PARTNER TODAY BY OTHERS ON THIS PAN THAT WOULD NOT FIT THE BILL THEN THE- OKAY THAT'S THE PLANNING. ISSUE THEN THERE'S TO ME I ALWAYS ASK THE SCORES ALL THIS. DISCRIMINATION. RACIAL ETHNIC NEIGHBORHOOD. AGAINST PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO AFFIRM EARLY PROTECT PEOPLE FROM THAT KIND OF DISCRIMINATION. OKAY IN OUR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM. AND I A CONSISTENTLY A VAST UBER LIFT. DAD A NOT DISCRIMINATE EXCEPT WE FIND THAT THERE'S LAWSUITS AGAINST THEM. THE DEAL WITH THAT ISSUE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE ADVOCATES FOR. PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES THAT ARE CLAIMING THAT THERE'S DISCRIMINATION. HOW CAN WE HAVE. DATA SO THAT THE- INSTITUTIONS OF GOVERNMENT TO PROTECT PEOPLE FROM DISCRIMINATION. AND THAT'S A CONCERN OF MINE MAIENSCHEIN I'M I'M ALWAYS GOING TO BE THE GUY'S GONNA RAISE THE QUESTION I REYES EVERY TIME WE HAVE A HEARING ON THIS SUBJECT OKAY EVERY TIME. I HAVE NOT FAILED TO RAISE THE SUBJECT OF DISCRIMINATION EVERY SINGLE HEARING WITHOUT. THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. AS CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE OF RAISE THIS ISSUE. THE SO A LOT OF THE REASONS WE NEED A CITY IS THE DATA THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS FOR PLUS AT PRECISELY THIS REASON WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHICH NEIGHBORHOODS ARE GETTING SERVICES AND WHICH ONES ARE WHICH ONES ARE ABLE TO USE THE SERVICES AND A AND- CLEAN AND- I HAVE. UNIMPEDED ACCESS RIGHT WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHERE OUR PROVISION OF INFRASTRUCTURE IS OR ISN'T. ADEQUATE TO GIVE THESE SERVICES OUT- AND THAT'S THE IRRESPECTIVE OF ALL THE OTHER STUFF FOR TIME OUT AGGREGATION ON AGGREGATION- IT'S THE ABILITY TO. TO ASK THESE QUESTIONS WRITE THIS ABILITY TO SAY. NOW THE FOLKS WHO ARE- AND WE TRY TO KEEP THIS MERELY SPACE ONLY USE CENSUS DATA TO LINE UP WHERE FOLKS ARE- BUT UNDERSTANDING. THE GEOGRAPHIES OF INEQUITY AND THEN BEING ABLE TO UNDERSTAND HOW SERVICES ARE WORKING THROUGH THESE DIFFERENT GEOGRAPHIES. THE PRIMARY QUESTION AND A LOT OF CITIES WORKING IN THE SPACE ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW. TO BALANCE THIS REALLY HARD QUESTION. RIGHT AS HOW DO WE GET THE STATE IN THE RIGHT WAY. AND MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ACTUALLY ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE. VERY BRIEFLY IF WE'RE GONNA. TRY TO GET WRAPPED UP SHORTLY THE VERY VERY QUICK TIMES SIMILARLY WE USE THAT DATA TO HELP TO ENSURE PERMIT COMPLIANCE WHETHER IT BE TWENTY PERCENT. NEEDS TO GO TO OUR DISADVANTAGE LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OR THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE ACTUALLY DOING EDUCATION PROMISE- WITHIN AROUND ACCESSIBILITY ALSO ONE BE REALLY CLEAR HOW THE CITY SACRAMENTO ADDRESSES BLOCK SIDEWALKS. AS OF DECEMBER WE EMPOWER PARKING ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS ISSUE CITATIONS IN THAT THE SEVENTEEN HUNDRED SINCE DECEMBER ONE THAT WE'VE ISSUED FOR. FOR EIGHTY EIGHT ISSUES WE TAKE I VERY SERIOUSLY WE TAKE IN A DIFFERENT DATA FASHION. BY EMPOWERING OUR PARKING ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS ISSUE FIFTEEN DOLLARS CITATIONS FOR EVERY BOX SIDEWALK OR CURB RAMP IN THE CITY- IT'S BEEN A- I CAN'T IT GOES TO THE COMPANIES- BUT- TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS MISSION TO THE COMPANY'S WHETHER OR NOT THEY CHOOSE TO. PASS THOSE COSTS ON TO THE USERS UP TO THEM WE'RE HOPING THEY DO BECAUSE THAT'S HOW YOU GET BETTER BEHAVIOR. WHEN I'M DOING IT FOR THE MONEY WE'RE DOING IT FOR BETTER BEHAVIOR. THANK THANK YOU. I THINK ON THE QUICK AT THIS. THIS IS WHITE SO. LOOK AT THIS THE- WHAT THE DATE IS BEING USED FOR HIS YOU DON'T ACTUALLY NEED TRIP DATA. TO SEE WHERE THE CITIES WHERE THE SCOOTERS ARE PARKED- AND WHERE THEY'RE BEING DEPLOYED YOU CAN LOOK AT. TRIP OR YOU CAN LOOK AT THE INDIVIDUAL SCOOTERS THEMSELVES BUT THAT DOESN'T IMPLICATE. PRIVACY IN THE SAME WAY. OKAY WELL OBVIOUSLY WE- OBVIOUSLY THERE'S FURTHER DISCUSSION TO BE HAD I THINK THAT WE ALL AGREE. THAT WE NEED TO NARAL. THE INFORMATION. TO MAKE SURE AND TO MAKE SURE THAT IT CONNECTS WITH WHAT THE- LEGITIMATE PURPOSES ARE FOR WHICH IS BEING SOUGHT. AND THEN WE GOT TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PROTECT IT- AND THESE ARE ALL DISCUSSIONS THAT ARE. STILL OVER PROBABLY IN THEIR NASCENT STAGES SO. I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE. I ALSO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT RESEARCH WE DON'T WANT TO. REMOVE THE ABILITY OF THE GREAT RESEARCH WE DO HERE AT THE UNIT AT. THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA THROUGHOUT OUR- RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS.

GLENN CAN IMPLEMENT ROBUST PROGRAMS TO MEET LOCAL GOALS SUCH AS TRANSIT SAFETY AND EFFICIENT ROUTES CREATE PINPOINTED PARKING AND DROP OFF LOCATIONS AND REDUCE DISCRIMINATION HOUSE WAS RECENTLY MENTIONED.

THE OTHER THING TOO AS A COMPONENT IS THAT THIS ISN'T THIS ISN'T NEW MOBILITY SURE MOBILITY HAS BEEN AROUND A CITIES HAVE HAD BIKE SHARE AT THIS IS JUST BEEN A PROLIFERATION OF THAT AN EXTENSION OF THAT WE SEE MORE IMPORTANT FOR PROVIDING THAT MOBILITY OPTION. ONE THING THAT WE DON'T I MEAN THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF SESSION ABOUT A DISCLAIMERS AND OPTING IN OPTING OUT. TO MY KNOWLEDGE THERE ISN'T AN OPPORTUNITY TO USE THE DEVICE YOU'RE GONNA OPT OUT OF THE INFORMATION YOU'RE SHARING SO THAT'S HE HOOKED IT BECAUSE THAT'S THE CASE. THEIR PERMISSION SHARED I THAN WHAT IS THEIR MOBILITY OPTION WELL THAT'S WHERE WE SEE WE HAVE TO HAVE THE DISCUSSION AROUND. AT HOW CITIES FIT INTO PROVIDING OR HAVE THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE THAT TYPE MOBILITY- AS FAR AS WHAT IS PROVIDED BY THE CURRENT OPERATORS- YOU KNOW IT'S IMPORTANT FOR CITIES TO HAVE INFORMATION NOT JUST FOR. THE TO BE ABLE TO REACT MORE REAL TIME THEN TRANSPORTATION PLANNING ALLOWS FOR IT COME FROM PLANNING BACKGROUND NO. THE DURATION THE EXTENT AND HOW EXPENSIVE IT IS TO BE. INFRASTRUCTURE INTO THE GRASS- BUT WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND MUCH QUICKER THAN THAT TO INFORMATION IS KEEP FOR CITIES TO BE ABLE TO.

HI MY NAME'S MORGAN HER LOCKER I MEANT SUFFERING JUNIOR CHAIRED STREETS A NONPROFIT WORKING TO ENABLE DATA TO BE SHARED BETWEEN PRIVATE ENTITIES AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES- I BECAME CONCERNED ABOUT THIS ISSUE LAST YEAR WHEN I BEGAN TO SEE CITY RELATED DATA POLICIES REGARDING AND YES PROCESSING THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR RE IDENTIFICATION. USERS TO AIMS THE DAY THE I. FIVE. SOME OF THE MADE PUBLIC. I BEGAN INVESTIGATING THESE PUBLIC MOBILITY TWO FEEDS FOLLOWING THESE PRACTICES AND CONFIRM THAT SEVERAL DID NOT PROPERLY ANONYMIZE TRIPS. INCLUDING ONE THAT ALLOWED ME TO IDENTIFY TRIPS BETWEEN HIGH SCHOOL AND YOUR BY PLANNED PARENTHOOD. THE PREPARATION IS RIGHT IN THE SCHOOL AND RIGHT NEXT TO THE PLANNED PARENTHOOD I SINCE BEEN ABLE TO FIND HUNDREDS MORE OF THESE. ON THE LEVEL OF TIME PRECISION WAS PLUS OR MINUS SEVEN MINUTES ON THIS TRIP SO IF YOU HAD ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT A STUDENT AT SCHOOL YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO FULLY IDENTIFY THEM. OTHER RESEARCHERS HAVE USES DATA TO STOCK CELEBRITY. IDENTIFY VULNERABLE RELIGIOUS POPULATIONS. AND EVEN TRACK PROTESTERS AT LAST YEAR'S WOMEN MARCH AS FOR WOMEN'S MARCH AS REPORTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES JUST THIS MONTH.

CBP AND POUNDS HERE. TO THE INCOMPLETE. SECURITY POLICIES AN INSUFFICIENT TRACKING OF DATA SHARING AGREEMENTS. AT SHARED STREETS WE BELIEVE WITH WE PARTNER WITH SACRAMENTO TO pYOU COULD DO THIS DATA- YOU COULD TREAT THIS DATA IT SAFELY AND ACCOMPLISH POLICY GOALS. WE BELIEVE THAT CITIES CAN AND SHOULD DEVELOP DATA COLLECTION INFRASTRUCTURE.
