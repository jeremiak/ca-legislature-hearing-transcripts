B. THIRTEEN TWENTY FOUR FOR TWO

00:12:45.297 --> 00:12:46.632
REASONS. FIRST THE ROSENTHAL ACT

00:12:46.699 --> 00:12:48.734
PLAINLY STATES ITS PURPOSE IS TO

00:12:48.801 --> 00:12:49.835
GOVERN THE BANKING AND CREDIT

00:12:49.902 --> 00:12:51.570
SYSTEM. AND FOR DECADES

00:12:51.637 --> 00:12:53.639
CALIFORNIA COURTS HAVE HELD.

00:12:53.706 --> 00:12:55.708
THAT RENT IS NOT A CONSUMER DEBT

00:12:55.774 --> 00:12:57.510
. UNLIKE A CREDIT CARD RENT IS

00:12:57.576 --> 00:13:00.012
OWED IN ADVANCE OF THE SERVICES

00:13:00.079 --> 00:13:02.615

SAY THAT RENTAL DEBT IS PROVIDED

00:13:13.259 --> 00:13:15.227
ON CREDIT. THE ISSUE OF CONSUMER

00:13:15.294 --> 00:13:16.495
DEBT IS COMPLICATED BECAUSE THE

00:13:16.562 --> 00:13:18.297
ROSENTHAL ACT INCORPORATES

00:13:18.364 --> 00:13:20.266
FEDERAL DEBT COLLECTION LAWS. SO

00:13:20.332 --> 00:13:21.934

INCONGRUENT WITH OUR LANDLORD

00:13:33.379 --> 00:13:36.482
TENANT LAW. THAT BRINGS ME TO MY

00:13:36.549 --> 00:13:38.551
SECOND POINT. THE BILL CREATES A

00:13:38.617 --> 00:13:40.119
CONFLICT WITH EXISTING UNLAWFUL

00:13:40.186 --> 00:13:41.453
DETAINER LAW THAT COULD MAKE IT

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:43.022
IMPOSSIBLE FOR LANDLORDS TO

00:13:43.088 --> 00:13:44.323
PROPERLY FILE AN UNLAWFUL

00:13:44.390 --> 00:13:45.824
DETAINER ACTION WHILE COMPLYING

00:13:45.891 --> 00:13:47.993

00:13:50.763 --> 00:13:51.130
THIRTEEN TWENTY FOUR

PRACTICES ACT. A FEDERAL LAW

00:13:56.535 --> 00:13:57.803
REQUIRES SPECIFIC ACTIONS

00:13:57.870 --> 00:14:00.139
REGARDING THE FIRST CONTACT THE

00:14:00.206 --> 00:14:01.240
DEBT COLLECTOR MAKES WITH THE

WRITTEN NOTICE CONFIRMING THAT

00:14:04.877 --> 00:14:06.712

NEW FEDERAL RULES ON TOP OF THE

EXISTING. CALIFORNIA RULES WOULD

00:14:29.335 --> 00:14:31.870

INCLUDE ALL THE FEDERAL.

00:21:10.235 --> 00:21:12.104

WE DID IT BY REFERENCE AND THEN

00:21:17.242 --> 00:21:18.577
IT BRINGS IN FEDERAL LAW WHICH

00:21:18.644 --> 00:21:21.246
WE HAVE NO ABILITY TO CONTROL-

00:21:21.313 --> 00:21:26.685
IF. NOT NOW I CAN'T SAY. THAT I

00:21:26.752 --> 00:21:28.120

WHETHER THEY THEIR DUPLICATIVE

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:34.393
OF THE STATE LAW WITH SOME

00:21:34.459 --> 00:21:38.764
ADDITIONS- BUT BUT THE STATE LAW

00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:41.800
. IS IF WE ADDED THE STATE LAW

00:21:41.867 --> 00:21:43.769

00:21:43.835 --> 00:21:45.637
SOME REQUIREMENTS THAT THAT

00:21:45.704 --> 00:21:46.938
CONFLICT WITH OUR LANDLORD

00:21:47.005 --> 00:21:48.340
TENANT LAW I JUST THINK IT IT

00:21:48.407 --> 00:21:49.608
BECOMES A MESS BECAUSE OUR

00:21:49.675 --> 00:21:51.343
LANDLORD TENANT LAW HAS BEEN

00:21:51.410 --> 00:21:52.711
CAREFULLY CRAFTED OVER THE YEARS

00:21:52.778 --> 00:21:55.714
IT. IT IS NOT PERFECT THERE ARE

00:21:55.781 --> 00:21:57.849
ALL KINDS OF ABUSES ON BOTH

00:21:57.916 --> 00:22:00.686

IT A BUTTE TAKE TAKE ADVANTAGE

00:22:06.925 --> 00:22:08.660
OF THE FACT THAT. WE HAVE A

00:22:08.727 --> 00:22:11.963
VACANCY RATE IN MANY OF OUR

00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:13.665
COMMUNITIES UP THAT'S VERY LOW

00:22:13.732 --> 00:22:15.500
SO THAT YOU CAN GET RID OF

00:22:15.567 --> 00:22:16.535
SOMEBODY AND FIND SOMEBODY RIGHT

00:22:16.601 --> 00:22:18.804

00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:21.873
NEED- BUT BUT THE ISSUES THAT

00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:24.509

PANDEMIC HAS HAS EXACERBATED

00:24:01.473 --> 00:24:02.507
SOMETHING WE KNEW BEFORE THE

00:24:02.574 --> 00:24:04.409
PANDEMIC AND MADE THE SITUATION

00:24:04.476 --> 00:24:06.845
INTO A MUCH MORE ACUTE AND

00:24:06.912 --> 00:24:08.713

WORK BOTH FOR THE LANDLORDS AND

00:24:13.051 --> 00:24:13.585
THE TENANTS- THERE'S ALSO A

00:24:13.652 --> 00:24:15.520
REASON WHY WE DOUBLE REFER A

00:24:15.587 --> 00:24:18.056
BILL. AND THIS IS A AN EXAMPLE

00:24:18.123 --> 00:24:19.558

THE PANDEMIC BUT THEY'VE JUST

00:25:19.584 --> 00:25:21.519
BEEN EXACERBATED AND I'VE

00:25:21.586 --> 00:25:23.588

THAT SO ON I WILL BE VOTING FOR

00:25:45.076 --> 00:25:47.078
THIS TODAY BUT I AGAIN I THINK

00:25:47.145 --> 00:25:48.513
THERE'S SOME LEGITIMATE CONCERNS

M. YOU KNOW THANK YOU SENATOR

00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:31.356
DRAW SO I AM APPRECIATIVE OF THE

00:26:31.423 --> 00:26:33.825
CONVERSATIONS THAT WE STARTED-

00:26:33.892 --> 00:26:36.227
YOU KNOW BETWEEN THE OPPOSITION

00:26:36.294 --> 00:26:37.162
AND SUPPORTERS ON THIS

00:26:37.228 --> 00:26:39.931
PARTICULAR ISSE- I THINK WHAT

00:26:39.998 --> 00:26:42.867
YOU'RE HEARING FROM REALLY THE

00:26:42.934 --> 00:26:43.935
GOOD THE GREAT MAJORITY OF FOLKS

00:26:44.002 --> 00:26:47.105
IS. THAT THAT THAT THERE IS. A

00:26:47.172 --> 00:26:49.140
TRYING TO FIND AN UNDERSTANDING

00:26:49.207 --> 00:26:51.910
BETWEEN FEDERAL ISSUES AND STATE

00:26:51.977 --> 00:26:54.112
ISSUES BUT ALSO BUT WITH THE

00:26:54.179 --> 00:26:57.882
ADDED CAVIAR OUT THAT WAY- DATA

00:26:57.949 --> 00:27:00.218
FOR. A MORTGAGE IS DIFFERENT

00:27:00.285 --> 00:27:01.886
BECAUSE SOMEONE'S NOT IN THE

00:27:01.953 --> 00:27:04.456
POSSESSION OF WHAT YOU ARE.

00:27:04.522 --> 00:27:06.558
READING SO I A THINK THAT THAT'S

00:27:06.624 --> 00:27:08.593
ONE ELEMENT THAT WE HOPE THE

00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:09.327
CONVERSATIONS TO CONTINUE BUT I

00:27:09.394 --> 00:27:11.262
ALSO REALLY WANT TO SAY THAT- AT

00:27:11.329 --> 00:27:12.831
AS THE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE I

00:27:12.897 --> 00:27:14.766
UNEQUIVOCALLY BELIEVE THAT IF

00:27:14.833 --> 00:27:16.267
YOU HAVE A DEBT FOR MORTGAGE.

00:27:16.334 --> 00:27:18.436
OBVERSES A DEBT FOR RENTERS YOU

00:27:18.503 --> 00:27:20.171
SHOULD BE GIVEN THE SAME

00:27:20.238 --> 00:27:22.173
CONSUMER PROTECTIONS- BUT

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:23.742
UNDERSTANDING THAT THE DATA

00:27:23.808 --> 00:27:25.310
DEFINITION IT'S GOING TO BE

00:27:25.377 --> 00:27:27.145
DIFFERENT AND MAY INVOLVE.

00:27:27.212 --> 00:27:29.447
ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS- I

00:27:29.514 --> 00:27:31.516
WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL-

00:27:31.583 --> 00:27:33.918
AND- I. HOPE THAT THE

00:27:33.985 --> 00:27:36.488
CONVERSATIONS I DO CONTINUE I

00:27:36.554 --> 00:27:38.823
THINK THAT IT'S GONNA BE REALLY

00:27:38.890 --> 00:27:41.459
IMPORTANT THAT WE FIND A WAY. TO

00:27:41.526 --> 00:27:44.496
EXTEND THE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS

00:27:44.562 --> 00:27:46.698
FOR THE RENTERS- BUT ALSO

00:27:46.765 --> 00:27:48.767
UNDERSTAND THAT- IT THERE ARE

00:27:48.833 --> 00:27:50.402
THERE IS A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT

00:27:50.468 --> 00:27:52.904
DYNAMIC THAT IS PART OF THIS

00:27:52.971 --> 00:27:54.339
CONVERSATION. WHICH IS THAT THE

00:27:54.406 --> 00:27:55.407
RENTERS ARE LIVING IN THE

00:27:55.473 --> 00:27:57.475
PROPERTY OF SOMEBODY ELSE- AND

00:27:57.542 --> 00:27:59.778
THAT'S THE PIECE. OF RIGHT

00:27:59.844 --> 00:28:00.512
THAT'S PRETTY MEANINGFUL IN AND

00:28:00.578 --> 00:28:03.148
HOW WE THINK ABOUT THE DEBT. US

00:28:03.214 --> 00:28:05.884
SO SEEING NO FURTHER COMMENTS

00:28:05.950 --> 00:28:07.752
CENTER LASSEN WOULD YOU LIKE TO

00:28:07.819 --> 00:28:09.387
CLOSE. SURE MAYBE WITH SOME OF

00:28:09.454 --> 00:28:12.991
THE TECHNICAL- ISSUES AS FAR AS

00:28:13.058 --> 00:28:14.426
THE FEDERAL AND THE STATE COULD

00:28:14.492 --> 00:28:16.661
YOU. REMEMBER RESPOND TO THAT

00:28:16.728 --> 00:28:18.363
AND THEN I'LL AND THEN I WILL.

00:28:18.430 --> 00:28:20.965
ENSURE THAT OUR GUESTS UP VERY

00:28:21.032 --> 00:28:23.168
BRIEFLY. THE ONE OF THE-

00:28:23.234 --> 00:28:25.003
AMENDMENTS TAKEN TODAY. ARE

00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:27.505
EXPLICITLY ADDRESSES THE

00:28:27.572 --> 00:28:32.777
QUESTION OF. WHETHER OUR- THAT

00:28:32.844 --> 00:28:34.412
RENTAL THAT IS A FOR OF CONSUMER

00:28:34.479 --> 00:28:35.914
CREDIT TRENDS. AND IT DEFINES IT

00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:37.982
NOT TO BE. SO NUMBER ONE OF

00:28:38.049 --> 00:28:40.618
WHAT- THIS MEDICINE WAS

00:28:40.685 --> 00:28:42.987
DESCRIBING I THINK IS ADDRESSED

00:28:43.054 --> 00:28:44.522
BY THAT I MEAN WILL THE

00:28:44.589 --> 00:28:45.590
OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO TALK ABOUT IT

00:28:45.657 --> 00:28:47.659
BE BEEN IN CONVERSATION WILL

00:28:47.725 --> 00:28:48.693
CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT IT. THE

00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:52.330
UP WE NEED TO HAVE TO SIT DOWN

00:28:52.397 --> 00:28:54.365
AND REALLY WORK THROUGH EXACTLY

00:28:54.432 --> 00:28:55.733
WHAT IN OF THE DEBT COLLECTION

00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:58.570
PROCESS ON ONE SIDE THE UNLAWFUL

00:28:58.636 --> 00:29:01.439
DETAINER PROCESS ON THE OTHER-SIDE MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S NO

00:29:01.506 --> 00:29:03.641
CONFLICT BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM

00:29:03.708 --> 00:29:05.043
I THINK IT WILL BE ABLE TO

00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:07.045
PRESENT. TO WORK THAT. THANK YOU

00:29:07.112 --> 00:29:10.315
THANK YOU. THANK YOU EVERYBODY

00:29:10.381 --> 00:29:11.816
AND I APPRECIATE THAT YOUR

00:29:11.883 --> 00:29:17.722
STARTING POINT WAS. ALL AGREE

00:29:17.789 --> 00:29:20.658
THAT WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING TO

00:29:20.725 --> 00:29:24.662
GIVE PROTECTIONS TO RENTERS OF

00:29:24.729 --> 00:29:27.332
THIS IS NOT ABOUT THE DEBT

00:29:27.398 --> 00:29:29.167
ITSELF FORGIVING OR COUNSELING

00:29:29.234 --> 00:29:30.535
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT THIS IS

00:29:30.602 --> 00:29:34.139
ABOUT WHAT PRACTICES. ARE USED.

00:29:34.205 --> 00:29:36.875
BUT TO TRY TO COLLECT THAT DEBT

00:29:36.941 --> 00:29:38.243
AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE'RE

00:29:38.309 --> 00:29:40.678
TALKING ABOUT IS WHAT KIND OF

00:29:40.745 --> 00:29:43.348
PRACTICES YOU KNOW. MAKE SURE

00:29:43.414 --> 00:29:46.851
THEY'RE NOT ABUSIVE PRACTICES-

00:29:46.918 --> 00:29:49.020
TO PRESSURE SOMEONE uPAY

00:29:49.087 --> 00:29:50.455
THAT'S REALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE

00:29:50.522 --> 00:29:52.790
DEBT ITSELF NOT TRYING TO CANCEL

00:29:52.857 --> 00:29:54.125
THE DEBT NOT TRYING TO DEAL WITH

00:29:54.192 --> 00:29:56.694
THE DEBT IS JUST HOW DO YOU DEAL

00:29:56.761 --> 00:29:59.631
AS A LANDLORD WITH THAT TENANT

00:29:59.697 --> 00:30:00.598
AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT THIS IS

00:30:00.665 --> 00:30:03.768
ALL ABOUT. AND I LIKE YOU YOU

00:30:03.835 --> 00:30:06.437
KNOW THINK ABOUT THE CONSUMER

00:30:06.504 --> 00:30:09.140
WHO TAKES ON EXCESSIVE DEBT TO

00:30:09.207 --> 00:30:11.943
PURCHASE LUXURY GOODS HAS LEGAL

00:30:12.010 --> 00:30:14.679
PROTECTIONS I WANT TO MAKE SURE

00:30:14.746 --> 00:30:16.447
THAT A RENTER YOU KNOW HAS THE

00:30:16.514 --> 00:30:18.149
SAME KINDS OF PROTECTIONS WHEN

00:30:18.216 --> 00:30:19.784
IT COMES TO THE PRACTICES OF

00:30:19.851 --> 00:30:22.020
TRYING TO GET PRESSURE YOU TO
