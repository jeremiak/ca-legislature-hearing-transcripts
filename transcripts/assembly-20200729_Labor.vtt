THIS MODEL THAT ACTUAL DAY BASE

01:12:10.959 --> 01:12:14.029
ON WHAT HAPPENED AND WHAT WE

01:12:14.096 --> 01:12:16.598

FOUND THAT. THAT THEY SEE WHAT.

01:12:20.102 --> 01:12:23.472
WASN'T NO WAY BUT WHAT A

01:12:23.539 --> 01:12:26.542

YOU DO IS YOU HAVE TO BE COMING

01:12:29.478 --> 01:12:32.081

AND IT AND WEEKS OR SOME I CAN

01:12:48.530 --> 01:12:49.531
WEAR A WHILE SO THE IDEA IS

01:12:49.598 --> 01:12:51.900
THAT YOU WOULD BE ACTUALLY

01:12:51.967 --> 01:12:54.303
PURCHASED PP. YOU'RE GOING TO

01:12:54.369 --> 01:12:58.240

THE NORMALLY YOU ANYWAY

01:13:09.918 --> 01:13:10.853
BASICALLY EVENTUALLY WHAT

01:13:10.919 --> 01:13:12.955
HAPPENS YES YOU DO HAVE TO

01:13:13.021 --> 01:13:15.023
BUILD A STOCKPILE BUT THEN

01:13:15.090 --> 01:13:17.059
EVENTUALLY WHAT HAPPENED HE

01:13:17.126 --> 01:13:24.366
COMING. GOING OUT AND SO IT'S

01:13:24.433 --> 01:13:26.969

01:13:29.938 --> 01:13:32.040
PROBLEM WE RAN INTO IT THAT

01:13:32.107 --> 01:13:34.810
BECAUSE PEOPLE THAT HAVE

01:13:34.877 --> 01:13:36.345
STOCKPILES WHEN YOU'RE- WHEN

01:13:36.411 --> 01:13:38.547

BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE TWICE-

03:20:40.728 --> 03:20:44.365
IT'S A BILL THAT IS DESIGNED TO

03:20:44.432 --> 03:20:45.900
FIGHT PAY DISCRIMINATION WITH

03:20:45.967 --> 03:20:48.669

WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR. I

03:20:52.573 --> 03:20:54.442

03:20:56.544 --> 03:20:59.080
CAN'T FIX WHAT WE CAN'T SHOW.

03:20:59.147 --> 03:21:01.449
SO THIS BILL WILL REQUIRE LARGE

03:21:01.516 --> 03:21:03.918

WAYS FIRST. IT WILL ENCOURAGE

03:21:30.311 --> 03:21:32.447
EMPLOYERS TO ANALYZE THEIR OWN

03:21:32.513 --> 03:21:34.916

THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION BUT

ADMINISTRATION MAKING IT

03:23:02.770 --> 03:23:04.939
FRANKLY MORE IMPORTANT THAN

03:23:05.006 --> 03:23:07.041
EVER THAT WE PURSUE HERE IN

03:47:59.198 --> 03:48:00.967
PAY FOR IT. AND YOU CAN'T TRUST

03:48:01.034 --> 03:48:04.704
IT BECAUSE YOU FEEL LIKE IT YOU

03:48:04.771 --> 03:48:09.776
HAVE TO TAKE IT BECAUSE OF THE

03:48:09.842 --> 03:48:12.578
FAMILY. PHONE IS MOST. TRY SO

03:48:12.645 --> 03:48:20.620
FAR. IT DOESN'T ALLOW FOR. AND

03:48:20.686 --> 03:48:22.055
THE REIMBURSEMENT YOU GET BY

03:48:22.121 --> 03:48:23.756
THE WAY ISN'T A HUNDRED CHANCE

03:48:23.823 --> 03:48:27.427
OF EVERY DOLLAR. IT'S LESS THAN

03:48:27.493 --> 03:48:29.996
70% IF YOU ARE SOMEONE WHO HAS

03:48:30.063 --> 03:48:32.065
MORE THAN A- MINIMUM WAGE JOB.

03:48:32.131 --> 03:48:33.666
IF YOU HAVE A MINIMUM WAGE JOB

03:48:33.733 --> 03:48:36.102
YOU CAN GET UP 270% OF YOUR

03:48:36.169 --> 03:48:37.603
WEEKLY PAYCHECK AGAIN IT'S

03:48:37.670 --> 03:48:40.073
MONEY. THAT YOU PUT INTO THE

03:48:40.139 --> 03:48:40.673
SYSTEM THAT WE'VE ALL PUT INTO

03:48:40.740 --> 03:48:42.575
THE SYSTEM. WELL THAT ISN'T

03:48:42.642 --> 03:48:43.776
ENOUGH FOR MOST PEOPLE ANYWAY

03:48:43.843 --> 03:48:45.278
SO THEY DON'T ACTUALLY TAKE THE

03:48:45.344 --> 03:48:47.613
LEAVE UNLESS THEY HAVE TO TAKE

03:48:47.680 --> 03:48:49.816
IT. IF YOU HAVE A PARENT WHO IS

03:48:49.882 --> 03:48:51.784
GOING TO THEIR FINAL ILLNESS

03:48:51.851 --> 03:48:53.119
AND YOU NEED TO TAKE THAT TIME

03:48:53.186 --> 03:48:55.188
OFF TO CARE FOR THEM. A LOT OF

03:48:55.254 --> 03:48:56.923
PEOPLE WON'T DO IT BECAUSE

03:48:56.989 --> 03:48:58.624
THEY'RE GONNA LOSE THEIR JOBS

03:48:58.691 --> 03:48:59.992
OR THEY DO HERE THEY DO. AND

03:49:00.059 --> 03:49:01.360
SHOW THAT PARENT GOES WITHOUT

03:49:01.427 --> 03:49:03.262
THE CARE THAT THEY NEED OR YOU

03:49:03.329 --> 03:49:04.864
WHICH AN INDIVIDUAL MOST

03:49:04.931 --> 03:49:07.667
ACTUALLY MOST CARE- FAMILY IF

03:49:07.733 --> 03:49:08.868
IT'S TAKEN THIS TAKEN BY THE

03:49:08.935 --> 03:49:11.170
INDIVIDUAL FOR THEIR OWN CARE.

03:49:11.237 --> 03:49:13.139
VERY LITTLE IS EVEN TAKEN FOR

03:49:13.206 --> 03:49:16.342
FAMILY MEMBERS SO. THE BOTTOM

03:49:16.409 --> 03:49:17.944
LINE I'LL CUT TO THE CHASE HERE

03:49:18.010 --> 03:49:21.214
IS THAT THE OPPOSITION- YOU

03:49:21.280 --> 03:49:22.315
KNOW LIKES TO GENERATE FEAR

03:49:22.381 --> 03:49:23.182
ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO PACK

03:49:23.249 --> 03:49:25.017

03:49:25.084 --> 03:49:25.651
TO LEAVE AND NO ONE'S GOING TO

03:49:25.718 --> 03:49:27.453
GO TO WORK IN A TAKEN ADVANTAGE

03:49:27.520 --> 03:49:29.188

YOU CAN IMPROVE EMPLOYER THINGS

03:49:51.110 --> 03:49:52.512
THAT MAKE WASH LACKING IT

03:49:52.578 --> 03:49:56.516
REQUIRES LOCAL OF APPROVAL AND

03:49:56.582 --> 03:49:58.885
THE CONFIRMATION AND IF YOU

03:49:58.951 --> 03:50:00.386

03:50:00.453 --> 03:50:03.789
YOU ACTUALLY THE RIGHT. GET A

03:50:03.856 --> 03:50:05.458
SECOND OPINION. THIS ALSO A

03:50:05.525 --> 03:50:07.260
PROCESS THAT IS ABSOLUTE.

03:50:07.326 --> 03:50:10.396
DESIGNED TO PROTECT BOTH THE

03:50:10.463 --> 03:50:11.931
WORKER AND THE EMPLOYER BUT TO

03:50:11.998 --> 03:50:14.400
RECOGNIZE THAT IN THE TWENTY

03:50:14.467 --> 03:50:16.536
FIRST CENTURY WHEN YOU HAVE TO

03:50:16.602 --> 03:50:18.504
IF YOU HAVE AN INTACT FAMILY

03:50:18.571 --> 03:50:20.173
YOU ARE MUCH MORE LIKELY THAN

03:50:20.239 --> 03:50:23.075
NOT TEND BOTH OF THOSE- PARENTS

03:50:23.142 --> 03:50:25.611
WORKING AND YET SHOP BUT HE'S

03:50:25.678 --> 03:50:27.813
GOT TO TAKE CARE OF EACH OTHER

03:50:27.880 --> 03:50:30.483
AND THEMSELVES. TIMES GET. AND

03:50:30.550 --> 03:50:32.685
WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT MOST OF

03:50:32.752 --> 03:50:34.820
THESE PEOPLE ALMOST ALL OF THEM

03:50:34.887 --> 03:50:37.123
WILL GO BACK TO THAT JOB THEY

03:50:37.190 --> 03:50:38.591
BECOME MORE EFFICIENT TO

03:50:38.658 --> 03:50:40.560
EMPLOYEES AND THEY STAY THERE

03:50:40.626 --> 03:50:42.929
MORE LOYAL EMPLOYEES. AND WHAT

03:50:42.995 --> 03:50:45.164
WE'VE DONE IN THIS BILL IS WE

03:50:45.231 --> 03:50:46.465
BROUGHT IT TO A NUMBER OF FIVE

03:50:46.532 --> 03:50:50.369
OR MORE EMPLOYEES. BECAUSE WHY

03:50:50.436 --> 03:50:51.938
SHOULD YOU NOT BE ABLE TO TAKE

03:50:52.004 --> 03:50:54.707
LEAVE BASED UPON THE NUMBER OF

03:50:54.774 --> 03:50:56.442
EMPLOYEES AT A BUSINESS IT IT

03:50:56.509 --> 03:50:58.277
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE YOUR FAMILY

03:50:58.344 --> 03:50:59.645
HEALTH YOUR HEALTH ISN'T

03:50:59.712 --> 03:51:01.614
CONTINGENT UPON WHETHER YOU

03:51:01.681 --> 03:51:02.848
WORK FOR A LARGE EMPLOYER OR

03:51:02.915 --> 03:51:06.953
NOT. AND SO- WHAT WE DID IS THE

03:51:07.019 --> 03:51:09.722
SMALL BUSINESS. OUR FOLKS AND

03:51:09.789 --> 03:51:10.456
WILL HAVE ONE OF THEM

03:51:10.523 --> 03:51:12.058
TESTIFYING TODAY THEY'VE DONE

03:51:12.124 --> 03:51:14.360
SOME RESEARCH ON THIS AND WHAT

03:51:14.427 --> 03:51:15.595
THEY'VE SHOWN IS THAT I THINK

03:51:15.661 --> 03:51:18.397
IT'S FIFTY NINE PERCENT. OF

03:51:18.464 --> 03:51:20.633
SMALL BUSINESSES OF FAR MORE

03:51:20.700 --> 03:51:23.603
SUPPORT THIS PROGRAM. BECAUSE

03:51:23.669 --> 03:51:24.203
THEY KNOW WHAT'S GOOD FOR THE

03:51:24.270 --> 03:51:26.706
BUSINESSES. AND ONLY 19% OF

03:51:26.772 --> 03:51:28.407
THESE COMPANIES WILL EVEN GO

03:51:28.474 --> 03:51:30.209
OUT AND HIRE SOMEBODY ELSE

03:51:30.276 --> 03:51:32.211
DURING THAT PERIOD OF TIME.

03:51:32.278 --> 03:51:34.280
REMEMBER WHEN YOU DO YOU DON'T

03:51:34.347 --> 03:51:37.350
HAVE TO PAY- A LOT OF THE-

03:51:37.416 --> 03:51:40.019
BENEFITS THAT A FULL TIME. AND

03:51:40.086 --> 03:51:41.354
PERMANENT EMPLOYEE GETS SO YOU

03:51:41.420 --> 03:51:44.090
DON'T HAVE TO PAY- LIKE A

03:51:44.156 --> 03:51:45.458
PENSION PLAN BECAUSE THESE ARE

03:51:45.524 --> 03:51:47.126
NOT THESE ARE TEMPORARY

03:51:47.193 --> 03:51:49.228
EMPLOYEES. BUT MOST COMPANIES

03:51:49.295 --> 03:51:51.030
FIND THE WHAT DO THEY DO THEY

03:51:51.097 --> 03:51:52.732

EXPERIENCE- WITH THE SMALL

04:22:12.383 --> 04:22:14.151
BUSINESS COMMUNITY. I FAMILY'S

BEEN IN BUSINESS IT'S SOME

04:22:15.886 --> 04:22:17.688
ASPECT IN OUR CULTURE FOR. MANY

04:22:17.755 --> 04:22:20.124
YEARS. AND WHEN YOU START A

04:22:20.191 --> 04:22:22.526
BUSINESS. YOU DON'T START WITH

04:22:22.593 --> 04:22:24.428
ONE OR TWO THREE EMPLOYEES

04:22:24.495 --> 04:22:25.830
ESPECIALLY WHERE IN OUR CULTURE

04:22:25.896 --> 04:22:28.399
YOU START WITH FIVE TO TEN

04:22:28.466 --> 04:22:29.333
SOMEWHERE RIGHT IN THERE

04:22:29.400 --> 04:22:30.434
BECAUSE YOU'RE YOU'RE TRYING

04:22:30.501 --> 04:22:32.570
THERE'S GROUND THAT YOU HAVE TO

04:22:32.636 --> 04:22:33.170
COVER THERE'S THINGS THAT HAVE

04:22:33.237 --> 04:22:34.672
TO BE REPAIRED. AND IF WE START

04:22:34.738 --> 04:22:36.040
DOING THIS WE START HAVING

04:22:36.107 --> 04:22:37.641
THESE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE

04:22:37.708 --> 04:22:39.743
SMALL BUSINESS COMMUNITY. AND

04:22:39.810 --> 04:22:41.846
UNDERSTANDING THAT. YEAH IF

04:22:41.912 --> 04:22:43.214
SOMEBODY GOES OUT ON FAMILY

04:22:43.280 --> 04:22:44.115
LEAVE THAT'S INCREDIBLY

04:22:44.181 --> 04:22:45.349
IMPORTANT AND I WOULD SAY THE

04:22:45.416 --> 04:22:47.551
OVERWHELMING MAJORITY. OF

04:22:47.618 --> 04:22:49.520
BUSINESSES ALLOW FOR THAT. I

04:22:49.587 --> 04:22:51.122
THINK IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT

04:22:51.188 --> 04:22:53.290
THAT THOSE STAY IN PLACE.

04:22:53.357 --> 04:22:54.692
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED

04:22:54.758 --> 04:22:56.160
TO. BUT WHEN WE HAVE THIS

04:22:56.227 --> 04:23:00.731
CONVERSATION THAT WE HAVE TO

04:23:00.798 --> 04:23:02.466
EXPAND THIS. WE HAVE GIVE THEM.

04:23:02.533 --> 04:23:05.069
FOR WEEKS LEAVE. IT IN THE IT'S

04:23:05.136 --> 04:23:07.238
IN THE- WELL IT'S IN THE TWELVE

04:23:07.304 --> 04:23:08.939
SET UP TO TWENTY FOUR WEEKS OF

04:23:09.006 --> 04:23:12.977
ANNUALLY. SO MAYBE THERE'S

04:23:13.043 --> 04:23:13.544
SOMETHING I'M MISREADING BUT

04:23:13.611 --> 04:23:14.778
THAT'S WHAT IT SAYS HERE. THE

04:23:14.845 --> 04:23:15.980
WHEN WE HAVE THIS CONVERSATION

04:23:16.046 --> 04:23:18.382
AND WE'RE STEP IN THERE.

04:23:18.449 --> 04:23:18.883
THINKING ABOUT HOW DO WE

04:23:18.949 --> 04:23:22.887
PROTECT. THE EMPLOYEES WHEN THE

04:23:22.953 --> 04:23:24.155
BUSINESS COMMUNITY SHUTS THEIR

04:23:24.221 --> 04:23:28.492
DOORS. AFTER CO THAT ONE IN

04:23:28.559 --> 04:23:29.627
THREE WILL NOT REOPEN IN THE

04:23:29.693 --> 04:23:30.728
SMALL BUSINESS COMMITTEE WHEN

04:23:30.794 --> 04:23:31.662
THE REST OF THE BUSINESS ME

04:23:31.729 --> 04:23:33.564
SAYS YOU KNOW WHAT WE CAN'T DO

04:23:33.631 --> 04:23:35.866
THIS ANYMORE WE CAN'T AFFORD TO

04:23:35.933 --> 04:23:37.334
HIRE MORE PEOPLE. WE CAN'T

04:23:37.401 --> 04:23:38.602
AFFORD TO HAVE THAT MANY PEOPLE

04:23:38.669 --> 04:23:41.238
OFF AT ONE TIME. IT'S NO LONGER

04:23:41.305 --> 04:23:43.340
WORTH IT. NOW WHAT WE HAVE WE

04:23:43.407 --> 04:23:44.675
HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE

04:23:44.742 --> 04:23:46.110
UNEMPLOYED. AND I FIND A FAST

04:23:46.177 --> 04:23:47.411
NEED TO SMALL BUSINESS MAJORITY

04:23:47.478 --> 04:23:49.446
WHO HAS SPOKE IN SUPPORT OF

04:23:49.513 --> 04:23:51.482
THIS- SAYS THAT THEY REPRESENT

04:23:51.549 --> 04:23:52.416
OVER YOU'LL FOUR MILLION

04:23:52.483 --> 04:23:54.785
BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA. BUT

04:23:54.852 --> 04:23:56.654
THEY HAVE NO MEMBERSHIP. I

04:23:56.720 --> 04:23:57.922
THAT'S FASCINATING TO ME

04:23:57.988 --> 04:23:58.522
BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW THAT YOU

04:23:58.589 --> 04:23:59.990
CAN REPRESENT SOMEBODY. IF YOU

04:24:00.057 --> 04:24:02.459
HAVE NO MEMBERSHIP. SO WHEN YOU

04:24:02.526 --> 04:24:03.527
SAID ON THE GOVERNOR'S TASK

04:24:03.594 --> 04:24:03.994
FORCE YOU HAVE THESE

04:24:04.061 --> 04:24:05.596
CONVERSATIONS LIKE. THE

04:24:05.663 --> 04:24:06.931
BUSINESS COMMUNITY THAT IS IN

04:24:06.997 --> 04:24:09.166
OPPOSITION THOSE RE THE ONES

04:24:09.233 --> 04:24:10.801
THAT ACTUALLY PLOY PEOPLE.

04:24:10.868 --> 04:24:12.736
THEY'RE NOT JUST A SHELL

04:24:12.803 --> 04:24:14.872
COMPANY. THEY'RE NOT JUST A

04:24:14.939 --> 04:24:16.340
CHAU ORGANIZATION THAT YOU CAN

04:24:16.407 --> 04:24:17.741
HIDE BEHIND AND SAY WE

04:24:17.808 --> 04:24:18.442
REPRESENT THE BUSINESS

04:24:18.509 --> 04:24:20.277
COMMUNITY WHEN YOU ABSOLUTELY

04:24:20.344 --> 04:24:23.080
DO NOT. THE ONLY CHAMBER. IS IN

04:24:23.147 --> 04:24:25.282
OPPOSITION TO THIS. AND THERE

04:24:25.349 --> 04:24:26.383
WAS STUDIES THAT WERE PUT OUT

04:24:26.450 --> 04:24:28.552
IN THE BAY AREA COUNCIL. A

04:24:28.619 --> 04:24:31.522
STUDY AND I WOULD LOVE- AND I

04:24:31.589 --> 04:24:32.456
AM IN ASKS FOR THE BUSINESS

04:24:32.523 --> 04:24:33.924
THREE TO RESPOND TO THIS. BUT I

04:24:33.991 --> 04:24:36.727
LOVE BECAUSE ANY STUDY. THAT

04:24:36.794 --> 04:24:39.797
SAYS THAT THIS IS BENEFICIAL TO

04:24:39.863 --> 04:24:42.266
THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY. IS

04:24:42.333 --> 04:24:43.367
FUNDAMENTALLY WRONG YOU MAY

04:24:43.434 --> 04:24:45.269
LIKE IT YOU WE MAY ALL BE ABLE

04:24:45.336 --> 04:24:47.338
TO AGREE THAT PAID FAMILY LEAVE

04:24:47.404 --> 04:24:48.472
IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AND I

04:24:48.539 --> 04:24:50.808
BELIEVE THAT AS WELL. BUT THE

04:24:50.874 --> 04:24:52.509
FUNDAMENTAL FLAW IS TO SAY THAT

04:24:52.576 --> 04:24:54.912
THIS IS GOOD. FOR THE BUSINESS

04:24:54.979 --> 04:24:57.414
COMMUNITY. IS WRONG. IT'S

04:24:57.481 --> 04:24:59.283
FACTUALLY INACCURATE IN FOR

04:24:59.350 --> 04:25:00.050
SOME OF THESE FOLKS TO COME IN

04:25:00.117 --> 04:25:01.685
SUPPORT POUNDING THEIR DROP

04:25:01.752 --> 04:25:03.053
ABOUT HOW THEY'RE REPRESENTING

04:25:03.120 --> 04:25:04.655
THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY IS QUITE

04:25:04.722 --> 04:25:06.724
FRANKLY IRRITATING. BECAUSE I

04:25:06.790 --> 04:25:07.925
CAN TELL YOU MAIN STREET

04:25:07.992 --> 04:25:10.761
AMERICA. IS GETTING DEVASTATED.

04:25:10.828 --> 04:25:11.695
NONE OF THESE PEOPLE THAT WERE

04:25:11.762 --> 04:25:13.197
IN SUPPORT COME FROM THE ROLE

04:25:13.264 --> 04:25:16.867
COMMUNITIES. NONE OF A AND THAT

04:25:16.934 --> 04:25:17.868
TOO IS GOING TO GET JUST

04:25:17.935 --> 04:25:22.806
HAMMERED WHEN YOU DRIVE. DOWN

04:25:22.873 --> 04:25:23.307
MAIN STREET MY DISTRICT

04:25:23.374 --> 04:25:24.074
EVERYTHING'S BOARD UP. DOES IT

04:25:24.141 --> 04:25:25.042
ARE BOARDED UP ON THE RAGGED

04:25:25.109 --> 04:25:28.445
EDGE. THEY WERE WITHIN DAYS OR

04:25:28.512 --> 04:25:30.080
WEEKS OF NEVER RE OPENING THEIR

04:25:30.147 --> 04:25:32.383
DOORS AGAIN. AND SO THIS KIND

04:25:32.449 --> 04:25:34.018
OF BILL THOUGH IT'S INCREDIBLY

04:25:34.084 --> 04:25:35.519
IMPORTANT THAT WE PROTECT

04:25:35.586 --> 04:25:37.655
FAMILY LEAVE AND I CAN SUPPORT

04:25:37.721 --> 04:25:40.758
THAT. I THINK THE OVERWHELMING

04:25:40.824 --> 04:25:42.760
SCOPE OF THIS PARTICULAR PIECE

04:25:42.826 --> 04:25:44.762
OF LEGISLATION- IS

04:25:44.828 --> 04:25:46.063
PARTICULARLY- QUITE FRANKLY

04:25:46.130 --> 04:25:48.632
REGIS AND I DO BELIEVE THAT

04:25:48.699 --> 04:25:51.535
THIS WILL DO. IRREVERSIBLE HARM

04:25:51.602 --> 04:25:52.202
TO THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY

04:25:52.269 --> 04:25:54.471
BECAUSE WHEN NOBODY OPENS OUR

04:25:54.538 --> 04:25:55.606
DOORS AGAIN BECAUSE THEY CAN'T

04:25:55.673 --> 04:25:56.807
DEAL WITH ALL OF THE NEW

04:25:56.874 --> 04:25:58.575
REGULATIONS THAT WE AS A

04:25:58.642 --> 04:26:00.077
BUILDING PUT ON TOP IT'S NOT

04:26:00.144 --> 04:26:01.612
JUST ONE OR THE OTHER IT'S NOT

04:26:01.679 --> 04:26:02.846
LIKE THIS IS THE ONLY BUILD

04:26:02.913 --> 04:26:04.815
WE'VE DONE THIS YEAR THAT

04:26:04.882 --> 04:26:05.449
AFFECTS THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY.

04:26:05.516 --> 04:26:07.117
AND WE MAY ALL OF THEM IN THE

04:26:07.184 --> 04:26:08.419
TYLER. STACK THEM ONTOP OF

04:26:08.485 --> 04:26:10.154
EACH OTHER. AND WE SAY NEXT

04:26:10.220 --> 04:26:11.221
YEAR THE BUSINESS THREE IS

04:26:11.288 --> 04:26:12.156
GONNA HAVE TO ALL OF THESE

04:26:12.222 --> 04:26:14.291
THINGS. PEOPLE ARE GONNA SAY WE

04:26:14.358 --> 04:26:16.026
CAN'T DO THAT. AND THEY'RE

04:26:16.093 --> 04:26:17.461
GONNA SHUT THE DOORS IN THE

04:26:17.528 --> 04:26:18.629
REST OF THE EMPLOYEES ARE GOING

04:26:18.696 --> 04:26:20.864
TO BE OUT OF A JOB. SO I WOULD

04:26:20.931 --> 04:26:21.732
ACTUALLY I DO WANT THEM THE

04:26:21.799 --> 04:26:22.700
BUSINESS COMMUNITY YOU KNOW

COUNCIL STUDY BECAUSE I THINK

04:26:27.671 --> 04:26:28.706

MOST OF WHOM ARE SEVERELY

ACTION. AS THE US THE FRONT US

04:30:32.382 --> 04:30:34.217
AND SO WHAT I WOULD WANT TO

04:30:34.284 --> 04:30:36.453
AVOID IN MY COMMUNITY AND

04:30:36.520 --> 04:30:38.288
REALLY ACROSS THE STATE IS FOR

04:30:38.355 --> 04:30:40.357
THE SMALL MOM AND POP SHOPS TO

04:30:57.941 --> 04:30:59.142
MY QUESTION TO YOU IS IF YOUR

THEIR JOBS WOULD YOU CONSIDER.

04:31:09.252 --> 04:31:10.320
TAKING AN AMENDMENT THAT

04:31:10.387 --> 04:31:12.222
REMOVES A PRIVATE RIGHT OF

04:31:12.289 --> 04:31:13.690

OCCUR AFTER ALL REMEDIES ARE

04:31:52.896 --> 04:31:55.866
EXHAUSTED AND IF AN EMPLOYER

04:31:55.932 --> 04:31:59.703

PROCESS WHEN THE SMALL BUSINESS

PERSON CAN BE ADVISED THAT THE

04:32:18.689 --> 04:32:21.425
LAW GIVES THAT EMPLOYEE THE

04:32:21.491 --> 04:32:23.126
RIGHT TO TAKE THE LEAVE IF THEY

04:32:23.193 --> 04:32:25.062

04:32:25.128 --> 04:32:27.130
REMEMBER. WHAT WE'RE HEARING

04:32:27.197 --> 04:32:28.965
NOW IS I THINK THE SUGGESTION

04:32:29.032 --> 04:32:31.735
IS THAT BUSINESSES ARE GOING

04:32:31.802 --> 04:32:32.736

BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE ARE TAKE

04:32:34.538 --> 04:32:36.139
LEAVE THAT THAT ISN'T IT IN

04:32:36.206 --> 04:32:38.141
FACT IF I'M AN EMPLOYEE AND I

04:32:38.208 --> 04:32:39.076
HAVE COLD BUT I BETTER GET THE

04:32:39.142 --> 04:32:40.410
HECK OUT OF THERE WORKPLACE

04:32:40.477 --> 04:32:41.445
BECAUSE I'M GOING TO AFFECT

EVERYBODY ELSE. I WANT A MODEL

04:32:43.346 --> 04:32:45.882
THAT WORKPLACE PEOPLE LARGEST

04:32:45.949 --> 04:32:48.151
LEAVING THEIR WORK PLACES IN

04:32:48.218 --> 04:32:50.487
DROVES BECAUSE OF COLD. THE

04:32:50.554 --> 04:32:52.989
RESTAURANT CHARGE SUFFERING

04:32:53.056 --> 04:32:54.257
BECAUSE EMPLOYEES ARE WORKING.

04:32:54.324 --> 04:32:55.358
PEOPLE THAT RESTAURANTS ARE

04:32:55.425 --> 04:32:56.626
SUFFERING BECAUSE PEOPLE AREN'T

04:32:56.693 --> 04:32:58.295
GOING OUT AND BECAUSE I CAN'T

04:32:58.361 --> 04:32:59.796
WORK THEY DON'T HAVE THE MONEY

04:32:59.863 --> 04:33:00.864
TO BE ABLE TO GO TO THE

04:33:00.931 --> 04:33:03.500
RESTAURANT. AND HAVE DINNERS

04:33:03.567 --> 04:33:05.936
OUT. I MEAN IT THAT'S NOT THE

04:33:06.002 --> 04:33:07.971
CARS HERE AND I THINK WHAT WE

04:33:08.038 --> 04:33:09.873
NEED TO LOOK AT LEAST LET'S

04:33:09.940 --> 04:33:10.874
LET'S REVERSE THAT LENDS A

04:33:10.941 --> 04:33:12.442
LITTLE BACK. AND LOOK AT THE

04:33:12.509 --> 04:33:16.079
FACT. THE PEOPLE WHO ARE SICK.

04:33:16.146 --> 04:33:18.348
SHOULD NOT BE AT WORK BUT YOU

04:33:18.415 --> 04:33:19.983
KNOW IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

04:33:20.050 --> 04:33:23.386
PEOPLE HAVE ONLY BY LAW THREE

04:33:23.453 --> 04:33:25.856
PAID SICK DAYS A YEAR. SO

04:33:25.922 --> 04:33:28.091
WHAT'S HAPPENING IS. THAT

04:33:28.158 --> 04:33:29.593
PEOPLE ARE TAKING THEIR NOT

04:33:29.659 --> 04:33:30.694
LEAVING WORK THEY'RE NOT

04:33:30.761 --> 04:33:31.828
GETTING TESTED IF THEY'RE ILL

04:33:31.895 --> 04:33:33.096
THEY'RE NOT DOING WHAT THEY

04:33:33.163 --> 04:33:35.098
SHOULD DO TO PROTECT THE REST

04:33:35.165 --> 04:33:37.000
OF US BECAUSE THEY NEED THAT

04:33:37.067 --> 04:33:38.802
JOB. THEY'RE GOING TO GO TO

04:33:38.869 --> 04:33:41.104
WORK EVEN IF THEY'RE SICK. SO

04:33:41.171 --> 04:33:43.540
WHAT WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS

04:33:43.607 --> 04:33:45.976
ENCOURAGE PEOPLE. WHEN THEY ARE

04:33:46.042 --> 04:33:47.344
SICK OR WHEN YOUR GRANDMOTHER

04:33:47.411 --> 04:33:49.346

CHURCH SAYS. YOU'RE NOT GOING

04:33:58.755 --> 04:34:00.323
TO GET PAID AND I THINK THIS IS

04:34:00.390 --> 04:34:01.057
IMPORTANT YOU'RE NOT BEING

04:34:01.124 --> 04:34:04.528
PAID. SO THE EMPLOYER CAN BRING

04:34:04.594 --> 04:34:07.063
IN TEMPORARY HELP. DURING THAT

04:34:07.130 --> 04:34:08.265
PERIOD OF TIME BUT THAT

04:34:08.331 --> 04:34:09.566
ACTUALLY ONLY HAPPENS IN THE

04:34:09.633 --> 04:34:12.169
SMALL BUSINESSES. 19% OF THE

04:34:12.235 --> 04:34:14.137
TIME. WHAT HAPPENS IS EVERYBODY

04:34:14.204 --> 04:34:16.373
WORKS TOGETHER. THE NOTION THAT

04:34:16.439 --> 04:34:17.674
SUDDENLY WE'RE GOING TO HAVE

04:34:17.741 --> 04:34:19.476
ALL THIS LITIGATION IS THE

04:34:19.543 --> 04:34:21.011
CONSTANT CLAIM THAT THE CHAMBER

04:34:21.077 --> 04:34:23.513
MAKES IT'S NEVER. BEEN PROVEN

04:34:23.580 --> 04:34:26.883
CORRECT. WE HAD TO- I THINK

04:34:26.950 --> 04:34:28.785
WITH NEW PARENT LEAVE WE HAD

04:34:28.852 --> 04:34:31.588
AVAILABLE TO US. TWO POINT

04:34:31.655 --> 04:34:32.622
EIGHT MILLION PEOPLE NOW HAVE

04:34:32.689 --> 04:34:34.424
THE RIGHT TO TAKE THAT LEAVE.

04:34:34.491 --> 04:34:36.960
THE TOTAL AFTER THE FIRST YEAR

04:34:37.027 --> 04:34:38.528
WHEN COMPANIES WERE ARGUABLY

04:34:38.595 --> 04:34:40.363
JUST LEARNING ABOUT IT THERE

04:34:40.430 --> 04:34:41.431
WERE SIX HUNDRED AND TWENTY

04:34:41.498 --> 04:34:43.300
RIGHT TO TWO LETTERS. THERE

04:34:43.366 --> 04:34:45.435
WERE ISSUED OUT OF TWO POINT

04:34:45.502 --> 04:34:47.437
EIGHT MILLION PEOPLE ABLE TO

04:34:47.504 --> 04:34:50.841
ACCESS THAT LAW. SIX SIX

04:34:50.907 --> 04:34:52.008
HUNDRED TWENTY RIGHT TO OTHERS

04:34:52.075 --> 04:34:55.879
NOW THAT THERE IS NO WAY SIX

04:34:55.946 --> 04:34:56.413
HUNDRED TWENTY PEOPLE FILE

04:34:56.479 --> 04:34:58.248
LAWSUITS. WELL DON'T SUE FOR

04:34:58.315 --> 04:35:00.917
THIS THEY WANT THEIR JOBS. AND

04:35:00.984 --> 04:35:02.185
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

04:35:02.252 --> 04:35:04.988
SO IT IS I THINK IMPORTANT THAT

04:35:05.055 --> 04:35:07.023
AT SOME POINT IN TIME WE ALIGN

04:35:07.090 --> 04:35:08.859
ALL THIS. SO WE DON'T HAVE THE

04:35:08.925 --> 04:35:10.393
CALIFORNIA FAMILY RIGHT CHECK

04:35:10.460 --> 04:35:11.895
THE PAID FAMILY LEAVE ACT AND

04:35:11.962 --> 04:35:13.663
THEN THE ABILITY TO HAVE JOB

04:35:13.730 --> 04:35:15.732
PROTECTION. THEY SHOULD ALL BE

04:35:15.799 --> 04:35:17.868
IN ONE SYSTEM THIS MEASURE

04:35:17.934 --> 04:35:19.603
TRIES TO START MAKING THAT

04:35:19.669 --> 04:35:21.504
ALIGNMENT. THE PEOPLE WE DON'T

04:35:21.571 --> 04:35:23.106
WANT PEOPLE SHOULD GET SHOWING

04:35:23.173 --> 04:35:24.674
IN BEING SUED WE'VE GOT TO HAVE

04:35:24.741 --> 04:35:26.343
GREATER CLARITY ON WHAT THE LAW

04:35:26.409 --> 04:35:27.944
IS THAT PART OF WHAT THIS BILL

04:35:28.011 --> 04:35:30.013
THE AND I UNDERSTAND THAT ONE

04:35:30.080 --> 04:35:31.548
HUNDRED PERCENT- I SLIGHTLY

04:35:31.615 --> 04:35:33.950
DISAGREE WITH. YOU IN TERMS OF-

04:35:34.017 --> 04:35:35.852
YOUR STATEMENT THAT COLD IT IS

04:35:35.919 --> 04:35:37.854
NOT THE REASON WHY RESTAURANTS

04:35:37.921 --> 04:35:40.290
ARE NOT ONLY THE REASON MARK IT

04:35:40.357 --> 04:35:44.160
IS THE REASON WHY THE.

04:35:44.227 --> 04:35:46.429
STRUCTURE MUCH TO. IN THIS BOOK

04:35:46.496 --> 04:35:46.997

04:35:49.599 --> 04:35:51.034
IT WE HAVE SHUT DOWN OF COURSE

04:35:51.101 --> 04:35:52.669
SO THAT OBVIOUSLY IMPACTING

04:35:52.736 --> 04:35:53.870
RESTAURANTS THE DON'T HAVE THE

04:35:53.937 --> 04:35:55.372
OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE PATIO

04:36:06.116 --> 04:36:09.486
IS THAT IT'S NOT BECAUSE PEOPLE

04:36:09.552 --> 04:36:10.086
WANT TO WORK. THAT THAT'S NOT

04:36:10.153 --> 04:36:11.888
WHAT YOU KNOW. PEOPLE WANT TO

04:36:11.955 --> 04:36:14.090
WORK AND THEY'RE DESPERATE TO

04:36:14.157 --> 04:36:15.292
WORK AND THEY DON'T WORK THEY

04:36:15.358 --> 04:36:16.626
DON'T GET PAID AND THEN THEY

04:36:16.693 --> 04:36:18.128
DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY AND THEN

04:36:18.194 --> 04:36:19.229

COMMENT THAT WAS MADE. IS THAT.

WITHOUT LITIGATION. JUST THAT'S

04:44:47.503 --> 04:44:50.106
JUST NOT TRUE I MEAN THAT. THE

04:44:50.173 --> 04:44:50.706
POINT IS THAT YOU CAN AND THE

04:44:50.773 --> 04:44:57.980
THAT. THEIR JOB. IMPORTANT

04:44:58.047 --> 04:44:59.248
THING THAT EMPLOYER WILL NOT

FOLLOW THE LAW AND WHAT YOUR

04:45:00.450 --> 04:45:01.451
THREATEN THE A LOT AND I'M SURE.

04:45:01.517 --> 04:45:02.952
I CAN COME UP NOT OFF THE TOP

04:45:03.019 --> 04:45:04.253

04:45:06.989 --> 04:45:08.090
RIGHT ACTION AND THE LESS WE

04:45:08.157 --> 04:45:09.192
HAVE. LEGAL COMPLY BY THE END

04:45:09.258 --> 04:45:10.326
CAN BE BECAUSE THEY FOLLOW WITH

04:45:10.393 --> 04:45:11.961
A LOT. WHAT WE DON'T NEED AT

04:45:12.028 --> 04:45:13.095
THE- BUT IT. EVERYTHING WILL

04:45:13.162 --> 04:45:14.330
KIND OF THE STATE IS MADE AND

04:45:14.397 --> 04:45:15.865
IT IS NOT ACCURATE THAT YOU

04:45:15.932 --> 04:45:16.933
DON'T HAVE A LOT. OF THE

04:45:16.999 --> 04:45:18.201
EMPLOYEES RETURN TO WORK THAT'S

04:45:18.267 --> 04:45:19.769
NOT THE BASIS FOR THE LOT. THE

04:45:19.836 --> 04:45:21.103
LOCKET IS WHETHER OR NOT YOU

04:45:21.170 --> 04:45:22.905

AND NOT THAT THE FIGHT THE

04:45:27.310 --> 04:45:28.578
LACKEY THAT HAD NOTHING TO DO

04:45:28.644 --> 04:45:29.345
WITH WHETHER OR NOT YOU BRING

04:45:29.412 --> 04:45:31.047
THE EMPLOYEE BACK. THE OTHER

04:45:31.113 --> 04:45:32.448
POINT WAS THAT LOW WAGE WORKERS

04:45:32.515 --> 04:45:34.450
ARE INTERESTING ALLEGATIONS AND

04:45:34.517 --> 04:45:35.952
WHY DO YOU NEED A PRIVATE RIGHT

04:45:36.018 --> 04:45:38.321
OF ACTION. IF LOW WAGE WORKERS

04:45:38.387 --> 04:45:40.156
ARE NOT GOING TO GO FILE A LOT.

04:45:40.223 --> 04:45:47.463

THE OF EMPLOYMENT IN THE AGENCY

04:45:48.998 --> 04:45:49.599
CHARGED IMPORTING THAT CAN HELP

04:45:49.665 --> 04:45:50.800
THEM IF THEY NEED TO GO THROUGH

04:45:50.867 --> 04:45:53.636
THE- AND THEY CAN FILE PROTECT

04:45:53.703 --> 04:45:55.004
THE EMPLOYEE THERE YOU DON'T

04:45:55.071 --> 04:45:57.139
HAVE TO HAVE A PRIVATE RIGHT OF

04:45:57.206 --> 04:45:57.773
ACTION IN ORDER TO HAVE DROPPED

04:45:57.840 --> 04:46:04.447

04:46:16.192 --> 04:46:19.662
IT. IF WE CONTINUE HAVING THE

04:46:19.729 --> 04:46:20.997
CONVERSATION WHICH I'M SURE

04:46:21.063 --> 04:46:23.099
YOU'RE VERY OPEN TO. THIS IS

04:46:23.165 --> 04:46:25.201
NOW CHANGING IT SO THAT IT'S

04:46:25.268 --> 04:46:30.873
SOME. FROM FIFTY EMPLOYEES TWO

04:46:30.940 --> 04:46:32.041
FIVE EMPLOYEES WHICH IS WHERE

04:46:32.108 --> 04:46:33.609
THE SMALL BUSINESSES COME INTO

04:46:33.676 --> 04:46:34.810
PLAY WHICH IS MY BIGGEST

04:46:34.877 --> 04:46:36.479
CONCERN WHICH I'M SURE AND

04:46:36.546 --> 04:46:38.281
WHICH IS WHAT MR FLORA HAS ALSO

04:46:38.347 --> 04:46:39.348
EXPRESSED THIS ONE OF THE

04:46:39.415 --> 04:46:40.683
BIGGEST CONCERNS. I THINK

04:46:40.750 --> 04:46:42.151
THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US

04:46:42.218 --> 04:46:44.153
TO GET TO WHERE YOU WOULD LIKE

04:46:44.220 --> 04:46:47.189
TO BE ON THIS BILL- AND- THIS

04:46:47.256 --> 04:46:49.692
IS NOT A OF POSITION THAT I

04:46:49.759 --> 04:46:51.561
OFTEN FIND MYSELF AND BECAUSE I

04:46:51.627 --> 04:46:53.229
BELIEVE IN AGREE WITH A LOT OF

04:46:53.296 --> 04:46:54.497
THE ADVOCATES FOR SUPPORTING.

04:46:54.564 --> 04:46:57.733
THIS BILL. MY CONCERN IS THAT.

04:46:57.800 --> 04:46:59.101
THE SMALL BUSINESSES ALSO

04:46:59.168 --> 04:47:00.970
EMPLOY THE VERY PEOPLE IN MY

04:47:01.037 --> 04:47:03.172
COMMUNITY AND IF WE- AT THE

04:47:03.239 --> 04:47:05.107
CONTINUED REGULATIONS ON SMALL

04:47:05.174 --> 04:47:06.809
BUSINESSES JUST MAKE IT HARDER

04:47:06.876 --> 04:47:08.744
FOR PEOPLE TO GET JOBS. EVEN

04:47:08.811 --> 04:47:10.580
THOUGH I UNDERSTAND. I

04:47:10.646 --> 04:47:12.081
COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND THAT THE

04:47:12.148 --> 04:47:13.482
GOAL OF WHAT IS WHAT WE'RE

04:47:13.549 --> 04:47:15.084
TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH HERE

04:47:15.151 --> 04:47:18.120
ESPECIALLY. IN EXPANDING THE

04:47:18.187 --> 04:47:19.288
DEFINITION OF FAMILY ACROSS THE

04:47:19.355 --> 04:47:21.490

04:47:24.594 --> 04:47:28.798
HAS BEEN SAID. IN TERMS OF. THE

04:47:28.864 --> 04:47:31.233
STRESSES AND LACK OF RESOURCES

04:47:31.300 --> 04:47:33.769
TOWARD SMALL BUSINESSES THAT

04:47:33.836 --> 04:47:34.370

US. AND I'M NOT SURE I HAVE

04:47:46.382 --> 04:47:49.752

AND IT ARE ALL CALLS FOR AN

04:48:06.335 --> 04:48:07.737
EMPLOYER OF FIVE OR MORE TO

04:48:07.803 --> 04:48:09.405
PROVIDE THAT PREGNANCY

04:48:09.472 --> 04:48:11.907
DISABILITY LEAVE SO THIS ISN'T

04:48:11.974 --> 04:48:14.577
REALLY A STARTING NEW WHAT THIS

04:48:14.644 --> 04:48:16.579
IS DOING IS THE SAME WAY WE ARE

04:48:16.646 --> 04:48:18.047
WITH EXPANDING DEFINITION

04:48:18.114 --> 04:48:20.516
FAMILY. CREATING WITHIN AN

04:48:20.583 --> 04:48:22.985
EXISTING FRAMEWORK SOME OF THE

04:48:23.052 --> 04:48:24.820
ADDITIONAL CRITERIA WHICH WE

04:48:24.887 --> 04:48:26.122
NEED TO REFLECT THE TWENTY

04:48:26.188 --> 04:48:27.957
FIRST CENTURY IT WITH IN WHICH

04:48:28.024 --> 04:48:29.358
WE LIVE YOU MENTION

04:48:29.425 --> 04:48:30.826
INTERGENERATIONAL ALIKI YOU

04:48:30.893 --> 04:48:32.962
WERE CARE GIVER. OF YOUR

04:48:33.029 --> 04:48:35.665
GRANDMOTHER. WITH THE SECOND

04:48:35.731 --> 04:48:36.399
LARGEST INTERGENERATIONAL

04:48:36.465 --> 04:48:38.868
STATE. IN THE COUNTRY AND YET

04:48:38.934 --> 04:48:40.302
THE DEFINITIONS THAT WE USE

04:48:40.369 --> 04:48:42.304
DON'T REFLECT THE FACT THAT WE

04:48:42.371 --> 04:48:43.839
CARE FOR GRAND KIDS AND

04:48:43.906 --> 04:48:45.074
HOPEFULLY OUR GRAND KIDS OF

04:48:45.141 --> 04:48:46.442
CARE FOR US WHEN WE'RE IN OUR

04:48:46.509 --> 04:48:48.811
DOTAGE- AND THAT'S WHAT

04:48:48.878 --> 04:48:52.048
CALIFORNIA IS. SO I THINK THE

04:48:52.114 --> 04:48:53.282
FACT THAT THAT THAT THIS IS NOT

04:48:53.349 --> 04:48:55.217
A WHOLE NEW SYSTEM WERE

04:48:55.284 --> 04:48:57.119
CREATING. WE'VE DONE THIS WITH

04:48:57.186 --> 04:49:00.389
OUR PREGNANCY DISABILITY- AND

04:49:00.456 --> 04:49:02.058
THE YOU KNOW THE WHOLE ISSUE OF

04:49:02.124 --> 04:49:05.161
THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION IS

04:49:05.227 --> 04:49:07.897
KIND OF LIKE A- A RED FLAG THAT

04:49:07.963 --> 04:49:11.067
GETS THE FLOWN. BECAUSE I THINK

04:49:11.133 --> 04:49:13.836
BUSINESSES. IF YOU KNOW THEY

04:49:13.903 --> 04:49:15.705
THEY THEY DON'T LIKE THE NOTION

04:49:15.771 --> 04:49:17.106
THAT THEY COULD BE SUED IF THEY

04:49:17.173 --> 04:49:19.775
DO NOT DO WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED.

04:49:19.842 --> 04:49:21.143
THIS IS PART OF AN AND-

04:49:21.210 --> 04:49:22.712
MECHANISM AND I HAVE ALL THE

04:49:22.778 --> 04:49:23.746
RESPECT IN THE WORLD FROM HIS

04:49:23.813 --> 04:49:25.614
BARRERA WE HAVE WORKED TOGETHER

04:49:25.681 --> 04:49:27.717
AND WE'VE BEEN ADVERSARIES FOR

04:49:27.783 --> 04:49:29.719
QUITE SOME TIME AS WELL. THE

04:49:29.785 --> 04:49:32.121
FACT IS THAT YOU HAVE TO GO TO

04:49:32.188 --> 04:49:34.056
DE FE H. YOU HAVE TO GO AND YOU

04:49:34.123 --> 04:49:35.791
HAVE TO. WHAT DO YOU

04:49:35.858 --> 04:49:37.927
IMMEDIATELY CHICA OR RIGHT TO

04:49:37.993 --> 04:49:39.495
SHOW ORDER. THAT DOESN'T MEAN

04:49:39.562 --> 04:49:41.464
YOU YOU ARE GOING TO SHOOT.

04:49:41.530 --> 04:49:43.499
BECAUSE IN ORDER LAWSUITS

04:49:43.566 --> 04:49:45.801
REQUIRE THAT YOU HAVE DAMAGES

04:49:45.868 --> 04:49:47.570
THERE ARE SAFEGUARDS IN PLACE.

04:49:47.636 --> 04:49:50.506
THAT ALLOW EMPLOYERS TO RECOVER

04:49:50.573 --> 04:49:51.807
FEES AND COSTS. IF SOMEONE

04:49:51.874 --> 04:49:54.477
FILES A FRIVOLOUS LAWSUIT ON.

04:49:54.543 --> 04:49:56.345
AND YOU KNOW YOU TALK ABOUT THE

04:49:56.412 --> 04:50:00.416
PEOPLE IN YOUR COMMUNITY. I'M

04:50:04.253 --> 04:50:05.821
AND THEY WANT THE WORKING

04:50:05.888 --> 04:50:08.190
CONDITION TO BE TECH OF THEM.

04:50:08.257 --> 04:50:08.891
AND THEY WERE. PART OF WORKING

04:50:08.958 --> 04:50:12.661
FACE. THE JUDGE TO THAT MOST OF

04:50:12.728 --> 04:50:14.096
THOSE. YOU ABOUT IN YOUR-

04:50:14.163 --> 04:50:14.830
COMMUNITY FEEL THE SAME WAY

04:50:14.897 --> 04:50:16.832
ABOUT EMPLOYEES. THERE ARE

04:50:16.899 --> 04:50:19.001
FAMILY. AND THE AND THEY HAVE

04:50:19.068 --> 04:50:20.336
TO BE IN ORDER FOR BUSINESS TO

04:50:20.402 --> 04:50:21.871
BE SUCCESSFUL AND I SUSPECT

04:50:21.937 --> 04:50:23.806
ASSEMBLY MEMBER FLOOR WOULD GET

04:50:23.873 --> 04:50:25.307
WOULD AGREE. IF YOU TAKE GOOD

04:50:25.374 --> 04:50:27.543
CARE OF YOUR EMPLOYEES THEY'LL

04:50:27.610 --> 04:50:29.779
TAKE GOOD CARE YOU. AND THAT'S

04:50:29.845 --> 04:50:32.081
WHAT TALKING ABOUT HERE WE'RE

04:50:32.148 --> 04:50:34.183
NOT TALKING ABOUT CREATING.

04:50:34.250 --> 04:50:35.751
GENERAL WILD ALLEGATIONS

04:50:35.818 --> 04:50:37.787
BETWEEN PEOPLE IT'S JUST THAT

04:51:07.750 --> 04:51:09.418
**** IS A WE STAY FOCUSED ON

04:51:09.485 --> 04:51:11.520
WHAT THIS BILL DOES. AND THE

04:51:11.587 --> 04:51:12.888
FACT THAT SMALL BUSINESSES ARE

04:51:12.955 --> 04:51:15.124
HAVING PROBLEMS NOW IS THE IN

04:51:15.191 --> 04:51:17.860
NOT IN DISPUTE. NOT IN DISPUTE

04:51:17.927 --> 04:51:20.229
AT ALL BUT MIGHT MARK WHAT I AM

04:51:20.296 --> 04:51:22.598
SUGGESTING IS THAT ALLOWING

04:51:22.665 --> 04:51:24.800
YOUR EMPLOYEES. IF AND WHEN

04:51:24.867 --> 04:51:26.702
THEY GET SICK NOT BECAUSE THEY

04:51:26.769 --> 04:51:28.204
DON'T FEEL LIKE WORKING BUT IF

04:51:28.270 --> 04:51:30.339
THEY ARE SICK OR A LOVED ONE IS

04:51:30.406 --> 04:51:32.074
SICK OR THEY HAVE A NEW BORN.

04:51:32.141 --> 04:51:33.609
THAT THEY WANT TO BOND WITH

04:51:33.676 --> 04:51:34.944
THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE

04:51:35.010 --> 04:51:36.946
THAT TIME. AND THERE ARE FIVE

04:51:37.012 --> 04:51:38.981
OTHER STATES BY THE WAY THEY DO

04:51:39.048 --> 04:51:40.649
THIS ACTUALLY THE GO DOWN TO

04:51:40.716 --> 04:51:43.953
ONE OR MORE EMPLOYEE- NEW YORK-

04:51:44.019 --> 04:51:45.321
OF RHODE ISLAND I BELIEVE LET'S

04:51:45.387 --> 04:51:47.156
SEE NEW YORK RIGHT AYE THAT

04:51:47.223 --> 04:51:48.991
COULD. HAVE THE RIGHTS OF ONE

04:51:49.058 --> 04:51:52.528
POINT. ARMED SEVERAL MAJOR MAIN

04:51:52.595 --> 04:51:54.363
STAGE YOU KNOW BIG STATE. DOING

04:51:54.430 --> 04:51:57.066
IT AND I'M NOT SURE. TO GO

04:51:57.132 --> 04:51:57.900

04:51:57.967 --> 04:51:59.902
THAT BUSINESSES ARE NOT. AWFUL

04:51:59.969 --> 04:52:01.704
FAILING BECAUSE- THERE IS

04:52:01.770 --> 04:52:04.039
FAMILY LEAVE. ARE BECAUSE WE

04:52:04.106 --> 04:52:06.408
ARE PROVIDING THIS BECAUSE THEY

04:52:06.475 --> 04:52:08.544
HAVE THE RIGHT TO SEEK REDRESS.

04:52:08.611 --> 04:52:10.045
THE SAME THING HAPPEN AGAIN I

04:52:10.112 --> 04:52:10.846
MENTIONED EARLIER WITH NEW

04:52:10.913 --> 04:52:12.448
CURRENTLY THE WORLD WAS GOING

04:52:12.514 --> 04:52:14.316
TO FALL LAWSUIT YOU'RE GOING TO

IT'S DIFFICULT FOR BUSINESSES

04:52:21.423 --> 04:52:23.659
TO CHANGE THE WAY THINGS ARE IS

04:52:23.726 --> 04:52:27.263
REALLY MORE- REFLECTIVE OF WHAT

04:52:27.329 --> 04:52:29.298
ONCE WAS AND I SUBMIT THAT WE

04:52:29.365 --> 04:52:32.167
CAN. MAKE THESE CHANGES AND THE

04:52:32.234 --> 04:52:34.370
BUSINESSES WILL CONTINUE TO

04:52:34.436 --> 04:52:36.305
FLOURISH AND TO THRIVE AND

04:52:36.372 --> 04:52:38.007
THAT'S WHAT THIS THESE STUDIES

04:52:38.073 --> 04:52:39.742
BY THE WAY. THE START IT WAS

04:52:39.808 --> 04:52:41.911
DONE BY THE BAY AREA COUNCIL.

04:52:41.977 --> 04:52:43.178

BEEN GOING ON FOR YOU THERE'S

04:52:48.717 --> 04:52:50.319
ABOUT BENEFIT TO PAID. WEEKLY

AND THE BENEFITS OF HAVING JOB

04:52:52.254 --> 04:52:53.756
PROTECTION TO GO WITH THAT

04:52:53.822 --> 04:52:55.658
LEAVE. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS

04:52:55.724 --> 04:52:59.461
BILL IS. SO THE- BILL IT'S A

04:52:59.528 --> 04:53:02.932
CHALLENGING TIME BUT I SUBMIT

THAT TIME OFF. BUSINESSES ARE

04:53:07.236 --> 04:53:08.604
GOING TO FAIL BECAUSE WE'VE GOT

04:53:08.671 --> 04:53:10.706
IT LICKED THIS PROBLEM THAT

04:53:10.773 --> 04:53:11.707
WE'VE GOT AND WE'VE GOT TO

04:53:11.774 --> 04:53:13.842
RECOGNIZE THAT BUSINESSES ARE

04:53:13.909 --> 04:53:16.578
FAMILIES. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS

04:53:16.645 --> 04:53:19.915
BILL CALLS FOR AND WITH THAT. I

HOPEFULLY THIS WILL BE A LOT.

04:53:25.421 --> 04:53:28.190
SHORTER BOB IT'S UP WENT UP

04:53:28.257 --> 04:53:29.458
WHEN I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND

04:53:29.525 --> 04:53:31.226
INVOLVEMENT IN GET THIS MOVING

04:53:31.293 --> 04:53:33.329
ON SO WE CAN CONTINUE UP THE

04:53:33.395 --> 04:53:35.497
DISCUSSION AT AND DIVE DEEPER

04:53:35.564 --> 04:53:37.633
INTO THIS I THOUGHT IT JUST TWO

04:53:37.700 --> 04:53:39.501
THINGS I WOULD LIKE WHAT IS ONE

04:53:39.568 --> 04:53:41.103
THING I LIKE YOU YOU TO DO AND

04:53:41.170 --> 04:53:43.005

04:53:43.072 --> 04:53:45.541
DO IT I'M JUST GONNA LET YOU

04:53:45.607 --> 04:53:46.575

YOUR TWELVE WEEK TO TWENTY FOUR

04:53:47.876 --> 04:53:49.311
WE THERE'S GOT TO BE. THE IS

04:53:49.378 --> 04:53:52.014
THE LANGUAGE. IN THE TO BE

04:53:52.081 --> 04:53:52.948
TWEAKED STILL WE HAVE CLARITY

04:53:53.015 --> 04:53:56.418
LET'S. LET'S AT LEAST GET THAT-

04:53:56.485 --> 04:53:57.619
THAT'S THAT'S ALWAYS REALLY

04:53:57.686 --> 04:53:59.254
FRUSTRATING FOR ME WHEN ONCE I

04:53:59.321 --> 04:54:01.557
SAID THAT THIS ONE AND I. WE

04:54:01.623 --> 04:54:03.926
ALL. WE ALL CAN WRITE SOMETHING

04:54:03.993 --> 04:54:05.661
THAT. VERY CLEAR SAID WE

04:54:05.728 --> 04:54:08.063
UNDERSTAND IT. IT'S TWELVE. AND

04:54:08.130 --> 04:54:11.266
NOT TWENTY FOUR- THAT HAS A-

04:54:11.333 --> 04:54:14.069
AND THEN ON THE SMALL BUSINESS.

04:54:14.136 --> 04:54:18.207
ASPECT MY SMALL BUSINESS MAY BE

04:54:18.273 --> 04:54:21.110
UNIQUE AS- MY COLLEAGUE TO THE

04:54:21.176 --> 04:54:23.178
NORTH AND SO WHY WE MAY BE

04:54:23.245 --> 04:54:25.381
TALKING BRICK AND MORTAR BOB I

04:54:25.447 --> 04:54:27.082
HAVE A LOT OF BUSINESSES THAT

04:54:27.149 --> 04:54:29.218
ARE ABLE TO BUY CARS IN YOUR

04:54:29.284 --> 04:54:31.286
KIDS TO COLLEGES AND THEY ARE

04:54:31.353 --> 04:54:33.188
ON THE DISTRIBUTOR. AND I DON'T

04:54:33.255 --> 04:54:34.823
AWARE DATE INTO THAT AND SO I

04:54:34.890 --> 04:54:36.258
WILL BE I ALSO DIDN'T SEE MY

04:54:36.325 --> 04:54:38.927
CHAMBERS. ON EITHER SIDE OF

04:54:38.994 --> 04:54:40.629
THIS DISCUSSION AND SO I WILL

04:54:40.696 --> 04:54:42.464
BY THE DISRUPTING I WILL DO I

04:54:42.531 --> 04:54:44.099
WILL PERSONALLY HAVE DISCUSSION

04:54:44.166 --> 04:54:45.868
WITH MY CHAMBERS ON THE IMPACTS

04:54:45.934 --> 04:54:47.669
OF SMALL BUSINESSES. AND HOW

04:54:47.736 --> 04:54:49.505
THIS LEGISLATION WILL IMPACT

04:54:49.571 --> 04:54:52.408
THEM. I'M I THINK MANY OF THEM

04:54:52.474 --> 04:54:54.043
ESPECIALLY THE SIDEWALK WITH

04:54:54.109 --> 04:54:56.879
VENDORS. MAY NOT EVEN FALL INTO

04:54:56.945 --> 04:54:59.114
THIS THIS MAY BE. FIVE THEY DID

04:54:59.181 --> 04:55:02.017
NOT FIGHT THEY MAY BE FOUR

04:55:02.084 --> 04:55:04.019
THREE. BUT THERE'S A LOT OF

04:55:04.086 --> 04:55:05.654
THAT. THEY WOULD BE IMPACTED BY

04:55:05.721 --> 04:55:07.656
THIS BUT IF THEY ARE AT A FULL

04:55:07.723 --> 04:55:09.491
HEAD OF- BY PERSON LEVEL SUPER

04:55:09.558 --> 04:55:11.660
SEVEN. I WORK WE'RE GOING TO MY

04:55:11.727 --> 04:55:13.228
STAFF AND ARE GOING TO GO OUT

IT'S NOT THE MOST RIGHT PICK

04:55:22.404 --> 04:55:23.772
WAY. OF DOING THINGS BUT AT

04:55:23.839 --> 04:55:26.008
LEAST GET SENSE OF THIS BILL

04:55:26.075 --> 04:55:28.710

ACTUALLY MY DISTRICT AND

04:55:30.212 --> 04:55:35.250
TALKING TO INDIVIDUALS- WILL

04:55:35.317 --> 04:55:38.420
HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS AND MAY

04:55:38.487 --> 04:55:40.456
HAVE THE STAFF. IS A LOT

04:55:40.522 --> 04:55:41.056

IN THE PERSONAGE THAT. THEY'RE

04:55:56.772 --> 04:55:57.306
COULD PEOPLE DO GET SICK AND I

04:55:57.372 --> 04:55:59.241
THINK MOST OF THE SMALL

04:55:59.308 --> 04:56:00.409
BUSINESSES I DISTRICT MAKE

04:56:00.476 --> 04:56:01.643
ALLOWANCES FOR THAT NAY DIG

04:56:01.710 --> 04:56:03.011
INTO IT WITH A FIGURE THAT OUT.

04:56:03.078 --> 04:56:04.880
BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE AND

04:56:04.947 --> 04:56:06.248
OBVIOUSLY TALKING TO CHAMBERS

04:56:06.315 --> 04:56:07.583
OF MY DISTRICT AND GET A SENSE

04:56:07.649 --> 04:56:10.085
OF THAT. AND THEN WE'RE WE'VE

04:56:10.152 --> 04:56:14.022
BEEN GOING. DOING COLD IT.

04:56:14.089 --> 04:56:15.124
RELATED THINGS WITH THE

04:56:15.190 --> 04:56:16.658
BUSINESSES IN MY DISTRICT AND

04:56:16.725 --> 04:56:17.993
WE HAVE SEVERAL ALLIES THAT WE

04:56:18.060 --> 04:56:20.262
COULD TALK TO. TO GET A SENSE

04:56:20.329 --> 04:56:21.563
OF THAT AND SO ON AND IN OUR

04:56:21.630 --> 04:56:23.298
REPORT THAT BACK TO YOU. AND

04:56:23.365 --> 04:56:25.667
THEN YOU CAN. YOU CAN DECIDE

04:56:25.734 --> 04:56:28.103
HOW WE CAN PROCEED. I WOULD

04:56:28.170 --> 04:56:30.072
LIKE TO IF I MAY IN RESPONSE

04:56:30.139 --> 04:56:37.112
FOR THAT IS A CLOSE- ORIGINALLY

04:56:37.179 --> 04:56:37.713
THIS MEASURE CALL FOR ONE OR

04:56:37.779 --> 04:56:40.649
EMPLOYEE. AND THAT THAT CREATED

04:56:40.716 --> 04:56:41.984
A LOT HANGS. SO IT'S SO WE

04:56:42.050 --> 04:56:43.285
MOVED TO FIVE FOR MORE. AS I

04:56:43.352 --> 04:56:44.119
MENTIONED THERE ARE NUMBER OF

04:56:44.186 --> 04:56:45.754
OTHER STATES THAT ARE DOING

04:56:45.821 --> 04:56:47.422
THIS. I ALSO WANT TO BE REALLY

04:56:47.489 --> 04:56:49.291
CLEAR. THAT WHEN AN EMPLOYEE

04:56:49.358 --> 04:56:52.628
GOES OFF ON THIS. JOB PROTECTED

04:56:52.694 --> 04:56:54.663
LEAVE FOR TWELVE WEEKS. IT IS

04:56:54.730 --> 04:56:58.100
ON PAGE. SO AS THE EMPLOYER.

04:56:58.167 --> 04:57:00.903
AND YOUR SMALL RESTAURANT. IN

04:57:00.969 --> 04:57:02.004
IN ASSEMBLY MEMBER CARILLO

04:57:02.070 --> 04:57:04.006
SISTER YOU'VE NOW GOT THAT

04:57:04.072 --> 04:57:05.474
SALARY. THAT YOU CAN THEN

04:57:05.541 --> 04:57:07.609
OFFERED TO SHOP IN THE COMING

04:57:07.676 --> 04:57:08.977
TO WORK PART TO WORK A

04:57:09.044 --> 04:57:10.579
TEMPORARILY WHILE THAT OTHER

04:57:10.646 --> 04:57:13.515
EMPLOYEES SOFT. AND IF YOU HAVE

04:57:13.582 --> 04:57:15.450
A IF YOU KNOW MOST RESTAURANTS

04:57:15.517 --> 04:57:16.552
THEY CAN'T REALLY DO A LOT WHEN

04:57:16.618 --> 04:57:19.288
IT COMES TO BENEFITS. BUT IF

04:57:19.354 --> 04:57:21.757
YOU ARE WITH YOUR FULL TIME.

04:57:21.823 --> 04:57:23.725
HERS AND YOU'RE PAYING BENEFITS

04:57:23.792 --> 04:57:25.460
YOU BRING IN A YOU BRING IN

04:57:25.527 --> 04:57:27.663
SOMEONE WHO IS- TEMPORARY YOU

04:57:27.729 --> 04:57:28.964
DON'T HAVE TO PAY THOSE

04:57:29.031 --> 04:57:31.533
BENEFITS EITHER. SO IF YOU

04:57:31.600 --> 04:57:34.069
CHOOSE TO BRING SOMEONE IN TO

04:57:34.136 --> 04:57:36.071
FILL THAT OTHER PERSON SPOT

04:57:36.138 --> 04:57:37.906
YOU'RE NOT PAYING TWICE. AND I

04:57:37.973 --> 04:57:38.707
THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT

04:57:38.774 --> 04:57:41.009
RECOGNIZE YOU'RE NOT PAYING FOR

04:57:41.076 --> 04:57:42.778
THE EMPLOYEE WHO IS OUT ON THAT

04:57:42.844 --> 04:57:45.714
LEAVES. ITS JOB PROTECTED WHICH

04:57:45.781 --> 04:57:48.750
ON PAID THE ONLY PAYMENT THAT

04:57:48.817 --> 04:57:50.018
THE EMPLOYEE GETS IS FROM THAT.

04:57:50.085 --> 04:57:51.620
PAID FAMILY LEAVE THAT THEY

04:57:51.687 --> 04:57:54.289
PAID INTO THEMSELVES. SO THAT'S

04:57:54.356 --> 04:57:55.023
SOMETHING I THINK THAT'S REAL

04:57:55.090 --> 04:57:56.758
IMPORTANT WHEN IT COMES TO

04:57:56.825 --> 04:57:58.694
SMALL EMPLOYERS THEY'RE OT

04:57:58.760 --> 04:58:00.195
PAYING DOUBLE IN FACT THEY'RE

04:58:00.262 --> 04:58:01.430
NOT PAYING IT ALL AND WHAT

04:58:01.496 --> 04:58:03.498
HAPPENS IS IN THE REASON THAT.

04:58:03.565 --> 04:58:05.434
THE DATA SHOWS THAT COMPANIES

04:58:05.500 --> 04:58:07.302
ACTUALLY CAN FINANCIALLY

04:58:07.369 --> 04:58:09.471
BENEFIT DURING THAT. TIME IS

04:58:09.538 --> 04:58:11.039
BECAUSE THEY CAN SAVE THAT

04:58:11.106 --> 04:58:14.610
MONEY IN ONLY 19% OF COMPANIES.

04:58:14.676 --> 04:58:15.978
WILL GO OUT AND HIRE A

04:58:16.044 --> 04:58:18.113
REPLACEMENT THEY FIGURE OUT HOW

04:58:18.180 --> 04:58:20.449
TO MAKE IT WORK YOU KNOW MAYBE

04:58:20.515 --> 04:58:22.851
YOU GOT TO WORK A COUPLE EXTRA

04:58:22.918 --> 04:58:24.253
HOURS. THAT'S THE SIX ABILITY

04:58:24.319 --> 04:58:25.587
WE SEE SOME BUSINESSES SO I'D

04:58:25.654 --> 04:58:27.422
BE VERY INTERESTED. AS LONG AS

04:58:27.489 --> 04:58:29.658
WE'RE CLEAR ON WHAT THE BILL

04:58:29.725 --> 04:58:31.660
DOES AND DOESN'T DO. RAN I

04:58:31.727 --> 04:58:33.695
THINK THAT THAT IS THE PART OF

04:58:33.762 --> 04:58:36.531
PART OF. OUR CHALLENGES I MAY

04:58:36.598 --> 04:58:38.867
BE TALKING ABOUT BUSINESSES.

04:58:38.934 --> 04:58:39.735
THAT MAY NOT SHOW UP AND

04:58:39.801 --> 04:58:42.237
SURVEYS. BECAUSE THEY'RE

04:58:42.304 --> 04:58:42.838
IMMIGRANT POPULATION AND THEY

04:58:42.904 --> 04:58:46.008
DO NOT. SELF REPORT A REPORT A

04:58:46.074 --> 04:58:49.444
LOT OF THINGS AND SO. THE BAY

04:58:49.511 --> 04:58:51.380
AREA COUNCIL IN THEIR SURVEY

04:58:51.446 --> 04:58:51.847
AND I'M FROM SOUTHERN

04:58:51.913 --> 04:58:53.815
CALIFORNIA WHAT GOES ON IN BAY

04:58:53.882 --> 04:58:55.717
AREA MAY NOT BE APROPOS WHAT'S

04:58:55.784 --> 04:58:57.352
GOING ON IN OUR DISTRICT AND SO

04:58:57.419 --> 04:58:58.787
I. JUST WANNA MAKE SURE WE'RE

04:58:58.854 --> 04:59:00.522
REVIEWING APPLES TO APPLES

04:59:00.589 --> 04:59:03.025
RIGHT AND SO THAT I. DEBT THAT

04:59:03.091 --> 04:59:04.059
I TAKE CARE PEOPLE OF MY

04:59:04.126 --> 04:59:07.562
DISTRICT AND A TICKET IN RAT

04:59:07.629 --> 04:59:08.163
POPULATION MY DISTRICT BECAUSE

04:59:08.230 --> 04:59:10.999
OF THE REPORTS I GOT. ABOUT

04:59:11.066 --> 04:59:13.101
SMALL BUSINESSES. IT THAT

04:59:13.168 --> 04:59:14.002
THEY'RE GOING TO THEY'RE GOING

04:59:14.069 --> 04:59:15.337
TO SUFFER BECAUSE THE CALL OF

04:59:15.404 --> 04:59:17.639
IT YEAH. MAYBE AT A RATE OF 50%

04:59:17.706 --> 04:59:20.142
OF THE MAY CLOSE. IN MY

04:59:20.208 --> 04:59:23.378
DISTRICT A MAY BE 60% OR MORE.

04:59:23.445 --> 04:59:26.348
AND SO HOW DO I. HOW TO MAKE

04:59:26.415 --> 04:59:26.915
SURE WE DON'T FURTHER

04:59:26.982 --> 04:59:29.284
EXACERBATE THAT BECAUSE THEY

04:59:29.351 --> 04:59:30.886
ARE THE LARGEST EMPLOYER. EVEN

04:59:30.952 --> 04:59:32.254
THOUGH MY ALMA MATER USC TRIES

04:59:32.321 --> 04:59:34.456
TO CLAIM THAT THEY ARE. BY FAR

04:59:34.523 --> 04:59:37.426
SMALL BUSINESSES- EMPLOYED MUCH

04:59:37.492 --> 04:59:40.162
MORE MANY MORE PEOPLE- DAN DAN

04:59:40.228 --> 04:59:42.497
DAN U. S. C. SO- I THINK

04:59:42.564 --> 04:59:44.433
THERE'S A- THERE'S A PLACE I

04:59:44.499 --> 04:59:46.468
THINK THIS THIS IS IMPORTANT WE

04:59:46.535 --> 04:59:48.970
NEED TO DO THIS- WE JUST WANNA

04:59:49.037 --> 04:59:51.773
MAKE SURE. IT DOES HAVE. A NECK

04:59:51.840 --> 04:59:53.942
PACKED. INDIVIDUALS THAT MAY BE

04:59:54.009 --> 04:59:57.079
KIND OF IN A BIT INVISIBLE. TO

04:59:57.145 --> 04:59:59.047
THIS ALL THESE DATE IS A

04:59:59.114 --> 05:00:00.716
STUDIES EVEN THOUGH DISRESPECT

05:00:00.782 --> 05:00:04.486
MY COLLEAGUE OVER OVER HERE-

05:00:04.553 --> 05:00:06.488
MISTER FORD IT IT IT MAY NOT.

05:00:06.555 --> 05:00:07.389
IT MAY NOT FALL IN THAT

05:00:07.456 --> 05:00:09.925
CATEGORY THESE BUSINESSES THAT

05:00:09.991 --> 05:00:11.827
I'M TALKING ABOUT THAT. DEBT OF

05:00:11.893 --> 05:00:13.395
ISRAEL'S TALKING ABOUT THIS

05:00:13.462 --> 05:00:16.264
MADE GROUP THAT FALLS TO THE

05:00:16.331 --> 05:00:19.301
CRACKS AND THEN WE DON'T WANT

05:00:19.368 --> 05:00:23.305
THIS BILL. TO DRIVE. DRY

05:00:23.372 --> 05:00:26.441
FURTHER. CAN AND I THAT IN WITH

05:00:26.508 --> 05:00:28.543
CERTAIN LOOK AT AT A LOT OF

05:00:28.610 --> 05:00:29.144
THESE ARE PROBABLY BUSINESS

05:00:29.211 --> 05:00:32.681
THAT ONE OR TWO EMPLOYEES BUT

05:00:32.748 --> 05:00:34.683
IF THE BUT AGAIN EIGHT IT I

05:00:34.750 --> 05:00:36.385
THINK WE HAVE TO BE REAL CLEAR

05:00:36.451 --> 05:00:38.420
THAT THERE IS NO FINANCIAL

05:00:38.487 --> 05:00:42.023
BURDEN ON THE SMALL BUSINESSES.

05:00:42.090 --> 05:00:43.525
THEY'RE NOT BEING THEM AT THEIR

05:00:43.592 --> 05:00:45.293
NOT BEING ASKED TO PAY FOR THAT

05:00:45.360 --> 05:00:47.396
PERSON'S LEAVE. FACT THEY DON'T

05:00:47.462 --> 05:00:49.765
PAY AT ALL SO I THINK THAT'S AN

05:00:49.831 --> 05:00:51.733
IMPORTANT DISTINCTION AND I'D

05:00:51.800 --> 05:00:53.301
LOVE ACTUALLY I'D LOVE TO COME

05:00:53.368 --> 05:00:55.570
DOWN AND THE TAKE A WALK

05:00:55.637 --> 05:00:56.838
THROUGH SOME OF THOSE

05:00:56.905 --> 05:00:57.572
RESTAURANTS BECAUSE I'M ALWAYS

05:00:57.639 --> 05:01:00.342
UP FOR A GOOD MEAL. AND HAND

05:01:00.409 --> 05:01:03.412
WITH A ONE. ENDLESS SO EXPLAIN

05:01:03.478 --> 05:01:06.114
MORE BUT YOU KNOW LISTEN. I

05:01:06.181 --> 05:01:08.850
GUESS I HEAR. SO THAT THIS THIS

05:01:08.917 --> 05:01:11.019
BILL IS SOMETHING THOSE STUDIES

05:01:11.086 --> 05:01:12.087
HAVE BEEN DONE THEY'VE BEEN

05:01:12.154 --> 05:01:13.488
DOING SIMILAR STUDIES FOR

05:01:13.555 --> 05:01:15.657
DECADES THERE THAT THAT THIS

05:01:15.724 --> 05:01:16.925
THESE MOST RECENT ONE SIMPLY

05:01:16.992 --> 05:01:19.494
CONFIRM. PRIOR STUDY SO THIS IS

05:01:19.561 --> 05:01:23.331
NOT NEW INFORMATION- AND DIE I

05:01:23.398 --> 05:01:24.900
APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION. YOU

05:01:24.966 --> 05:01:28.103
KNOW CHANGES HARD- BUT I THINK

05:01:28.170 --> 05:01:29.104
WHAT WHAT ARE WE HAVE TO

05:01:29.171 --> 05:01:30.505
REMEMBER IS THAT THE CHANGE

05:01:30.572 --> 05:01:31.873
ALREADY OCCURRED WHICH IS. KIND

05:01:31.940 --> 05:01:33.942
OF PUT INTO PLACE. THOSE

05:01:34.009 --> 05:01:36.478
GUIDELINES THAT WILL REFLECT

05:01:36.545 --> 05:01:37.946
THE CHANGING WORLD IN WHICH WE

05:01:38.013 --> 05:01:39.014
LIVE AND WITH THAT I WOULD

05:01:39.080 --> 05:01:40.782
ACTUALLY LIKE. THE SENATE A

05:01:40.849 --> 05:01:42.717
WANTED TO YOUR POINT ON AND I

05:01:42.784 --> 05:01:45.320
APPRECIATE THAT. THIS DOESN'T.

05:01:45.387 --> 05:01:47.389
DESERVE INVOLVED IN AN IN DEPTH

05:01:47.456 --> 05:01:49.291
CONVERSATION AT THE COMMITTEE

05:01:49.357 --> 05:01:50.959
LEVEL SO. I HAVE NO PROBLEM

05:01:51.026 --> 05:01:52.494
WITH THE AMOUNT OF TIME TO

05:01:52.561 --> 05:01:52.994
FOLKS TAKE BECAUSE IT'S

05:01:53.061 --> 05:01:59.434
IMPORTANT- AND THE- POINT OF

05:01:59.501 --> 05:02:02.037
STUDIES I DON'T KNOW WE DO

05:02:02.103 --> 05:02:06.808

TO SEE THERE'S A PROCESS THERE.

05:02:13.782 --> 05:02:14.950
LET'S NOT BE CAN MOVE ON FROM

05:02:15.016 --> 05:02:18.987
THAT. YEAH THE PMR OPINION WITH

05:02:19.054 --> 05:02:20.489
SMALL BUSINESS MAJORITY I'M

05:02:20.555 --> 05:02:22.390
HAPPY TO COMMENT ON FIRST AND

FOREMOST WE ARE NOT MEMBERSHIP

OF AN ORGANIZATION AS MENTIONED

05:02:26.495 --> 05:02:29.164
EARLIER- AND WE DO THAT SO THAT

05:02:29.231 --> 05:02:30.499
WE CAN BE AS INCLUSIVE AS

05:02:30.565 --> 05:02:32.667
POSSIBLE AS WE ARE SERVING VERY

05:02:32.734 --> 05:02:34.269
SMALL MICHAEL BUSINESS OWNERS

LEAVE UNDER THE CURRENT STRICT

05:05:03.618 --> 05:05:05.353
STANDARDS OF THESE ARE

05:05:05.420 --> 05:05:06.287
DISPROPORTIONATELY LOW WAGE

ARE VULNERABLE. AS WE'VE SEEN

05:05:42.957 --> 05:05:44.993
OF THE EXPOSURE AT WORK. OF MY

05:05:45.060 --> 05:05:45.960

ZIP CODES AND CENSUS TRACTS IN

THE IN THE BAY AREA. THE

05:05:53.735 --> 05:05:55.570
HIGHEST RATE ABOVE IT SO I WANT

05:05:55.637 --> 05:05:56.671
TO. DISPEL THE MYTH THAT

05:05:56.738 --> 05:05:58.273
EVERYBODY IN THE BAY AREA IS

05:05:58.339 --> 05:06:00.375
RICH AND IS DOING JUST OKAY.

05:06:00.442 --> 05:06:02.477
DOING FINE. IT'S NOT THE CASE

05:06:02.544 --> 05:06:04.179
AND I HAVE A LOT OF WORKERS MY

05:06:04.245 --> 05:06:05.180
DISTRICT THAT. BECAUSE

05:06:05.246 --> 05:06:10.885
CERTAINLY TELL YOU OTHERWISE SB.

05:06:10.952 --> 05:06:13.121
THIRTEEN PARTICULARLY AND- I'D

05:06:13.188 --> 05:06:14.222
ARE UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS PAID

05:06:14.289 --> 05:06:15.490
FAMILY LEAVE IS AVAILABLE. TO

05:06:15.557 --> 05:06:16.858
ALL WORKERS BECAUSE IMMIGRATION

05:06:16.925 --> 05:06:19.427
STATUS BECAUSE THEY ALL INTO IT.

05:06:19.494 --> 05:06:20.428
AND IF YOU LOOK AT OTHER

05:06:20.495 --> 05:06:21.529
COUNTRIES THAT HAVE THINGS LIKE

05:06:21.596 --> 05:06:22.630
SINGLE PAYER HEALTHCARE THAT

05:06:22.697 --> 05:06:25.200
HAVE PAID FAMILY LEAVE HUNDRED

05:06:25.266 --> 05:06:27.335
PERCENT. FOR LONGER PERIODS OF

05:06:27.402 --> 05:06:29.437
TIME AND HOW THEY'RE DEALING

05:06:29.504 --> 05:06:31.973
WITH THIS PANDEMIC LET ALONE.

05:06:32.040 --> 05:06:32.774
EVEN OUTSIDE OF A PANDEMIC

05:06:32.841 --> 05:06:34.476
ENVIRONMENT HOW WELL THEIR

05:06:34.542 --> 05:06:36.644
FAMILIES ARE TAKEN CARE OF HOW

05:06:36.711 --> 05:06:37.879
THEIR FAMILY CENTERED. AND

05:06:37.946 --> 05:06:39.314
REALLY WHO'S IN THE BEST

05:06:39.380 --> 05:06:41.549
POSITION TO ABSORB PAIN. AND I

05:06:41.616 --> 05:06:44.285
THINK THAT WE COULD HOPEFULLY

05:06:44.352 --> 05:06:45.754
AGREED TO WORKERS IN THE IN THE

05:06:45.820 --> 05:06:47.322
LEAST BENEFICIAL POSITION TO

05:06:47.388 --> 05:06:49.290
ABSORB THAT PAN. SMALL

05:06:49.357 --> 05:06:51.392
BUSINESSES WOULD BE. TO THE

05:06:51.459 --> 05:06:53.228
NEXT LEVEL UP WHERE WE HAVE TO

05:06:53.294 --> 05:06:54.796
DO WE CAN TO PROTECT THEM AND

05:06:54.863 --> 05:06:56.431
SUPPORT THEM BUT AS- THE

05:06:56.498 --> 05:06:57.766
SENATOR SAID THIS IS UNPAID

05:06:57.832 --> 05:07:00.135
LEAVE. IT'S PAID BY US WE PAY

05:07:00.201 --> 05:07:02.504
INTO IT. BUT THE WORKERS UNPAID

05:07:02.570 --> 05:07:03.404
SO THEY DO HAVE TO MANAGE THE

05:07:03.471 --> 05:07:05.273
TIME WHETHER SIX WEEKS EIGHT

05:07:05.340 --> 05:07:08.009
pTO MANAGE OPERATIONS DURING

05:07:08.076 --> 05:07:09.944
THAT TIME. AND THAT'S AND

05:07:10.011 --> 05:07:11.146
THAT'S VERY LOW BUT THEY CAN

05:07:11.212 --> 05:07:13.314
USE THAT SAME MONEY THEY WOULD

05:07:13.381 --> 05:07:14.149
PAY TO BRING IN SOME

05:07:14.215 --> 05:07:18.186
TEMPORARILY OR- FIGURE A MAN

05:07:18.253 --> 05:07:21.089
WITH THE WORKFORCE IF THEY HAVE.

05:07:21.156 --> 05:07:23.958
BUT THAT WERE TO A WORKER

05:07:24.025 --> 05:07:26.027
BASICALLY YOU GET SICK YOU HAVE

05:07:26.094 --> 05:07:27.128
TO TAKE CARE OF A LOVED ONE

05:07:27.195 --> 05:07:28.062
YOU'RE OUT OF A JOB AND THEY'RE

05:07:28.129 --> 05:07:30.632
JUST UPON IT IN HIS MACHINERY.

05:07:30.698 --> 05:07:32.167
AND THIS IS ACTUALLY A JOBS

05:07:32.233 --> 05:07:33.735
UBER BECAUSE IT SAVES THAT

05:07:33.802 --> 05:07:35.737
INDIVIDUAL THEIR JOB. AND IT'S

05:07:35.804 --> 05:07:37.605
SOMEONE THAT THE EMPLOYER

05:07:37.672 --> 05:07:39.007
ALREADY LIKES AND HAS ON THEIR

05:07:39.073 --> 05:07:40.241
SPOUSE OR NOT TIME TO HIRE

05:07:40.308 --> 05:07:41.876
SOMEONE. THEY DON'T WANNA HAVE

05:07:41.943 --> 05:07:43.578
WORKING FOR THEM IT'S IN SO

05:07:43.645 --> 05:07:45.446
IT'S GOOD PUBLIC POLICY FOR A

05:07:45.513 --> 05:07:47.148
SOCIAL CONTRACT. THAT ACTUALLY

05:07:47.215 --> 05:07:50.118
SUPPORTS FAMILIES. AND IT

05:07:50.185 --> 05:07:51.286
