GOOD MORNING EVERYBODY WE WILL BEGIN. THEY'RE BOTH SUPPOSED TO BE A PART. YEAH WILL BEGIN TODAY'S HEARING FOR THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION FINANCE AT TODAY'S AN OVERVIEW OF THE GOVERNOR'S TWENTY TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE- BUDGET RELATED TO TOP NINETY EIGHT- WE WILL HEAR. ABOUT SOME OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL A TWO EXPANDED LEARNING OPPORTUNITY SCHOOL TUITION AND OVERSIGHT INFRASTRUCTURE LEAD TO THAT THE- GREEN SCHOOL TECHNOLOGY TRANSPORTATION AND THE CHARTER SCHOOL FACILITY MAINTENANCE AS WELL AS FOR LITERACY PROPOSALS AND CURRICULA DEVELOPMENT OVERSIGHT. OF THE WILL BEGIN BY ASKING THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO FOCUS ON ISSUE NUMBER ONE THANK YOU. MORNING CARE MEMBERS LENA GRANT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. I'M ALL TALK THROUGH THAT EXPANDED LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES PROGRAM PROPOSAL- THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES AN INCREASE OF THREE POINT FOUR BILLION ONGOING PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND. FOR THE ELO PROGRAM EXPANDED LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES PROGRAM PROVIDING AN ONGOING TOTAL OF FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS. THIS BUILDS UPON THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT INVESTMENT OF ONE BILLION ONGOING PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND. AND SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY FOUR MILLION. IN ONE TIME FUNDS ARE WORKING TOWARDS- THE INTENDED FIVE BILLION BY TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX. OF PERCENT THE STATUTE ALL LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES REGARDLESS OF COMMUNITY DEMOGRAPHICS ARE ENCOURAGED TO OFFER SUBSIDIZED YELLOW PROGRAMS PROGRAMMING SERVICES TO ALL THEIR STUDENTS USING A FEE SCHEDULE THAT CONSIDERS FAMILY INCOME AND THE ABILITY TO PAY. AND GIVEN THE INCREASE TO THE PROGRAM'S ONGOING BUDGET BEGINNING AT TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES PROVIDING LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES WITH 75% OR ABOVE UNDUPLICATED PEOPLE PERCENTAGE GPP A RATE OF TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED. PER AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE AND RADIATE WHICH IS AN INCREASE FROM THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO RATE OF ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY PER ADA APPROXIMATELY THREE THOUSAND TWENTY SEVEN DOLLARS THREE EIGHTY EIGHT UP FROM SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY TWO. I'M CURRENT LAW PROVIDES A HIGHER RATE TO L. FOR ELLIE AS- ABOVE A THRESHOLD OF BUDGET PROPOSES AN ADDITIONAL YEAR OF CUSHION FOR THE EXPENDITURE OF FUNDS PROVIDED IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. AND THAT WILL ALLOW AT LEAST TO CONTINUE BUILDING CAPACITY FOR THEIR ELO PROGRAM OFFERINGS- ELLIE IS WILL HAVE TO FISCAL YEAR TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR TO EXPEND FUNDS RECEIVED IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. DURING THE SIMILAR TREATMENT GIVEN THE FUNDS RECEIVED IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO THE CURRENT YEAR. ALSO AUDIT PENALTIES FOR NONCOMPLIANCE WILL NOT BE ENFORCED UNTIL THE TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR FISCAL YEAR. ON THE AUDIT PIECE- SPECIFICALLY IN RESPONSE TO MANY OF THE CONVERSATIONS WITH ELLIE A SINCE THE ENACTMENT OF THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE PROGRAM. ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES A PROPORTIONATE AUDIT PENALTY RELATIVE TO THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS NOT PROVIDED OR OFFERED ACCESS TO BE A LITTLE PROGRAM SERVICES. AND THE NUMBER OF DAYS OR HOURS TO FOUND OUT OF COMPLIANCE SIMILAR TO THE EXISTING INSTRUCTIONAL DAY PENALTIES. THAT ARE USED FOR EIGHTY EIGHT INSTEAD OF. INSTEAD OF THE COMPLETE LOSS OF FUNDING THAT IS THAT IS CURRENTLY IN THE LAW. LASTLY THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. TRAILER BILL PROPOSES SEVERAL TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS TO FURTHER FACILITATE THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE PROGRAM. BY ELEAZAR AND THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. ON THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS BUT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. OKAY THANK YOU HELLO. HI GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN BRUCE MICHAEL FETTERS WITH A LEO- THE GOVERNOR PROPOSAL RAISES SEVERAL IMPORTANT ISSUES ABOUT DISTRICTS ABILITY TO AFFORD THE SIGNAL INCREASE ON FUNDING IN THE BUDGET YEAR AS WELL AS HOW THE EXTRA LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES PROGRAM SOME EFFORTS WAS YELLOW P. PROGRAM WOULD OFFER A AND B- LONG TERM WE HAVE PUBLISHED MORE DETAILED ANALYSIS AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE PROPOSAL BUT WE WILL FOCUS ON A FEW KEY ISSUES HERE. OF GIVEN THE L. IS STILL IN THE FIRST YEAR OF IMPLEMENTATION THE EXTENT TO WHICH DISTRICT THAT BILL CUT THEIR EXPENDITURE IN PROGRAMS I'M CLEAR A DISTRICTS THAT FACE CHALLENGES WITH BUILDING OUT THEIR ELO P. PROGRAMS MAINLY BECAUSE- OF THE DIFFICULTY HIRING STAFF. TO THE EXTENT THAT STAFFING SHORTAGES CONTINUE TO BE A CONSTRAINT WRAPPING UP OF IT'S BEEN A LEARNING PROGRAMS WILL BE DIFFICULT. THE PROPOSAL TO DELAY THE AUDITING REQUIREMENTS THAT MISS GRANT REFERENCE WITH- GIVE DISTRICTS INDIVIDUAL YEAR TO BOTH OF THE PROGRAMS BEFORE THEY COULD POTENTIALLY HELP THE FUNDING REDUCED- REGARDING THE LONG TERM RATE OF TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED FOR ENGLISH LEARNER LOW INCOME STUDENTS WE ESTIMATE THAT THE THREE IS LIKELY SUFFICIENT ENOUGH TO RUN A PROGRAM. SIMILAR CASES. ASSEMBLY WE HAVE THAT THE FIVE COMMIT THEO P. IN THE LONG TERM. WE BE ENOUGH TO FOR ALMOST PER OF LOS. IN GRADES THREE THROUGH SIX. OF THIS WITH SUFFICIENT TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO PER. ALL OF THE IN THE LEARNER LOW INCOME THROUGH. ASSEMBLY A FOR TO THE- THE TIERED FUNDING STRUCTURE THAT NOT A LINE WITH PROGRAMMATIC REQUIRED. THE IMPLEMENTATION THEY IMPLEMENTING STATUTE FOR. A EUROPEAN SPECIFIES AN INTENSE ULTIMATELY PROVIDE ALL DISTRICTS WITH THE UNIFORM RATE OF TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED BRING A STERNER LOW INCOME STUDENT. HOWEVER DISTRICTS TO HAVE LOWER SHARES OF ENGLISH JOURNALISM STUDENTS HAVE MUCH LOWER EXPECTATIONS. YOU'RE ONLY REQUIRED TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO HALF OF THEIR ENGLISH- IN LOCUM STUDENTS. WERE AS DISTRICTS WITH HIGHER SHARES OF THE STUDENTS MUST PROVIDE ACCESS TO EVERY STUDENT. REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE INTERESTED OUR LOW INCOME- ACCESS TO THE PROGRAM. THIS MAKES THE FUNDING RATES MORE GENEROUS FOR DISTRICTS LOWER SHARES. OF THINGS IN OUR LOW INCOME STUDENTS. ON THE TRIP TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDE A UNIFORM RATE PER ANDERSON WILL COME STUDENT. WITH THE SAME REQUIREMENT FOR ALL DISTRICTS. BEING THAT THEY OFFER IN PROVIDE ACCESS TO ALL ENGLISH LEARNER IN OAKHAM STUDENTS INTERESTED IN THE PROGRAM. I FOCUSING THE REQUIREMENTS AND FUNDING AROUND EATING LISTENER LOW INCOME STUDENTS. WE THINK OF RECOMMENDATIONS ONCE FOR THE STUDENTS WITH THE GREATEST NEED FOR EXPANDED LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES. THAT GUARANTEED ACCESS TO THE PROGRAMS REGARDLESS. OF WHICH DISTRICT AT THE AT TEN. NO LONG RUN WE WERE THAT. HAVE TO A FUN MODEL BAY FUNDS TO PROTESTS. IN THE PROGRAM. THIS WILL ENSURE STATE FOR IS TIED TO DO WOULD DISTRICT HAVE THE GREATEST FOR THE PRO. WELL WE ALSO RECOMMEND THAT THE STATE REQUIRED DISTRICTS TO REPORT THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS PARTICIPATING. IN NUMBER STAFF EMPLOYED IN THEIR EXPENDITURE IN PROGRAMS. THIS INFORMATION COULD BE USED IN THE FUTURE TO CONSIDER CHANGES TO RESTRUCTURE OR STAFFING REQUIREMENTS. LASTLY WE RECOMMEND REJECTING THE ONE TIME FUNDING FOR ARTS AND MUSIC. EDUCATION INFRASTRUCTURE. DISTRICTS CAN ROLL OVER UNSPENT FUNDING RATE- INTO THE NEXT BUDGET YEAR FOR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. AND THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES TO EXTEND THE FLEXIBILITY TO TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. GIVEN THE CHALLENGES BUILDING OUT PROGRAMS WE THINK THAT IT'S HIGHLY LIKELY DISTRICTS WILL HAVE UNSPENT FUNDS FROM THE CURRENT YEAR AND WAS YEAR. TO THE EXTENT THAT DISTRICTS WOULD LIKE TO MAKE ONE TIME PURCHASES OF. THE BILL OF THE PROGRAMS THAT CAN DO SO WITH THESE EXISTING FUNDS. AT THE LEGISLATURE WERE TO PROVIDE. ADDITIONAL ONE TIME FUNDING WE RECOMMEND REMOVING THE RESTRICTIONS. THAT 75% OF THE FUNDS BE SPECIFICALLY FOR ARTS AND MUSIC. BASED ON OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH EXPERTS WE THINK THAT. DISTRICTS SHOULD HAVE LOOKED ABILITY TO SPEND ONE TIME FUNDING ON A VARIETY OF ACTIVITIES. THAT WOULD HELP THEM DEVELOP A QUALITY PROGRAM. SUCH AS STAFF TRAINING FACILITY MOTHER MODIFICATIONS AND SCIENCE EQUIPMENT- THAT CONCLUDES OUR COMMENTS WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU. THANK YOU WILL NOT FROM OUR DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MY NAME IS MICHAEL FUNK ON THE DIRECTOR OF THE EXPANDED LEARNING DIVISION OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. TESTIFIED TODAY ON BEHALF OF OUR STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION TONY THURMOND. THIS ONE BEFORE I START THANK OF THE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE PARTY GOING SUPPORT. FOR THE NURTURING AND DEVELOPMENT OF EXPANDED LEARNING AND AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE CALIFORNIA PROBABLY THE G. CATION IS GRATEFUL. FOR THE ADDITIONAL THREE POINT FOUR BILLION IT FOR THE EXPANDED LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES PROGRAM. OR AOKI. EXHILARATING TO THE FIVE BILLION GOAL THAT WAS ESTABLISHED BY THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE IN THE PAST YEAR'S BUDGET. SINCE NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN WHEN THE LEGISLATURE ALLOTTED FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS. OR PUBLICLY FUNDED SCHOOL BASED AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS CALIFORNIA HAS ALWAYS BEEN SEEN AS THE INNOVATOR. AND LEADER FOR MENTIONING HOW LEARNING CAN BE ENHANCED AND EXPANDED THROUGH THESE INVESTMENTS. THUS THE NAME CHANGE FROM AFTER SCHOOL TO EXPAND OF LEARNINGS IN. TWENTY SIXTEEN. WHILE THE PLO P. FUNDING. WITH THE L. P. FUNDING COMMUNITY EDUCATORS FROM COMMITTEE ORGANIZATIONS FAITH BASED ALL TYPES OF ORGANIZATIONS WAS ONLY DREAMED OF BEFORE. STUDENTS THAT HAVE EXISTED IN THE MARGINS. WILL BE SEEN SUPPORTED. NO ONE EVER PREPARED CALIFORNIA. MUST RESIST STARTING FIRST TO THINK ABOUT THE RULES AND THE COMPLIANCE THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY WITH THE FLEXIBILITY OF THIS PROGRAM. FOR L. A. LEADERS TO START. WITH FIRST CONSIDERING WHAT THEIR STUDENTS AND FAMILIES NEED AND DESERVE. THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT AMENDMENTS TO THE TRAILER BILL THAT WILL FACILITATE JUST THAT. THE SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IS THE PROPORTIONAL WITHHOLDING THE DEPARTMENT FINANCES ALREADY MENTIONED. THIS ALLOWS LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES A WAY TO DO THEIR BEST WITHOUT HIGH RISK OF LOSING EVERYTHING IF THEY FAIL IN ONE COMPONENT. WE HAVE HEARD FROM MANY DISTRICT ADMINISTRATORS SUPERINTENDENTS. OTHER LEADERS THAT THE STAKES WERE TOO HIGH BEFORE THIS PROPORTIONAL METHOD WAS ADDED AND SO THIS REALLY NEEDS TO BE TO STAY IN THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. AS WILL NOW HAVE THE INCENTIVE TO DO THE BEST. BEATLES CREATIVE AT INNOVATIVE AS POSSIBLE WITHOUT FEAR OF BEING OVERLY PENALIZED. WE ARE STILL REVIEWING THE FULL TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE AND WILL BE WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THE LEGISLATURE TO REFINE THE PROPOSAL IN THE WEEKS AHEAD. AND THE CITY HAS BEEN PROVIDED MANY VERY. OPPORTUNITIES FOR ELEAZAR TO RECEIVE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND COACHING. WE ARE APPEARING BEFOR MANY OF THEM ARE EDUCATIONAL STAKEHOLDER ADVOCACY GROUPS OR MEMBERSHIP GROUPS TO PRESENT DETAILS AND PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ON THIS PROGRAM WE ARE HOSTING WEEKLY OFFICE HOURS WHERE ELLIE A LEADERS JOINING THEM FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF ON FRIDAYS FROM NOON TO ONE THIRTY. TO ADDRESS QUESTIONS TO TALK THROUGH IDEAS AND TO MATCH THEM WITH PEERS WE HAVE FIGURED OUT A WAY FOR THIS TO WORK. I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TEST. OF COURSE WILL REMAIN ONAND ENGAGE IN A CONVERSATION ANSWER QUESTIONS. I'LL TAKE ONE MOMENT OF- WE ARE SEEN- MY PERSONAL CRUSADE IS TO THIS PROGRAM NOT TO BE CALLED A LOT OF IT REMINDS ME OF SOME KIND OF A CYCLOPS MOVIE- SO I'VE TIMED IT IT DOESN'T TAKE ANY LONGER TO SAY YELLOW P. OR YELLOW PROGRAM THANK YOU LOP SO THAT'S MY. THE LIGHT HEARTED ON THE SIDE. ASSIDUOUS FOR THIS FOR THIS HEARING TODAY. THANK YOU. OKAY YOU NOW WILL HE FIRST FROM AN ENTITY. IN THE GROUND OUT THERE THROUGHOUT. FOR THE MINOR COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION. GOOD MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS AND THANK YOU MICHAEL THANKS FOR REMINDING US TO CALL IT YELLOW P. I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT AND APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY. BEFORE THE COMMITTEE TODAY ON BEHALF OF. MY COLLEAGUES WITHIN THE SYSTEM OF SUPPORT FOR EXPANDED LEARNING AS WELL AS THE GRANTEES THAT I SUPPORT MY NAME AGAIN IS MARBLED I AM THE REGIONAL THE PER REGION FIVE X. EARNING AND BASTYR MONTEREY COUNTY OFFICE EDUCATION. I SUPPORT TWO HUNDRED FORTY EXISTING AFTER SCHOOL EDUCATION AND SAFETY A SENSE AND TWENTY FIRST CENTURY COMMUNITY LEARNING CENTER T. K. THROUGH TWELFTH GRADE PROGRAMS. IN A FOUR COUNTY SERVICE AREA SO I REPRESENT MODERATE AND SANTA CRUZ COUNTY SAN BENITO AND SANTA CLARA COUNTY HERE TODAY AS WELL AS- MY COLLEAGUES ACROSS THE STATE AGAIN YOU I PROVIDE TECHNICAL SUPPORT I WERE ON THE BOOTS AND YOU KNOW ON THE GROUNDS PROVIDING. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE MEANING I'M COACHING A CONSULTATION FACILITATION AND MOST IMPORTANTLY BROKERING RESOURCES AT A LOCAL LEVEL TO ENSURE THE QUALITY. OF OUR EXPANDED LEARNING PROGRAMS I'M I JUST WANT TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE GRANTEES THAT I SUPPORT TODAY- I'M THE EXCITEMENT THAT WE HAVE IN THE FIELD AT THIS OPPORTUNITY IS LIKE NONE OTHER ANYTHING FOR MANY MANY YEARS I'VE BEEN IN THE FIELD NOW FOR A COUPLE OF DECADES. AND WE HAVE OFTENTIMES BEEN ADVOCATING FOR A RATE INCREASE WHICH WE RECENTLY RECEIVED FOR A SYSTEM TWENTY FIRST CENTURY UP TO. TEN DOLLARS AN EIGHTEEN CENTS WHICH WAS A BLESSING I'M FOR MANY OF OUR PROGRAMS- WE CANNOT SURVIVE OF COURSE WITHOUT OUR COMMUNITY BASED PARTNERS AND- I'M- REPRESENTING THE REGION THAT I DO AND THAT THE HIGHEST QUALITY- COST OF LIVING AREA- THERE ARE MANY OF COURSE AND STATE GOT. I'M SANTA AND SAN CLARA BEING OF THEM. THAT WAS AN INITIAL OPERA AT THE- AND RETENTION OF QUALITY STAFF TOWARD FIELD. AND WITH THE EXPANDED LEARNING OPPORTUNITY AB PROGRAM WE HAVE AN AMAZING OPPORTUNITY TO PERHAPS GET EVEN CLOSER TO A LIVING WAGE. AND THIS IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT- FOR THOSE PROGRAMS WHO. ARE REALLY STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW TO FIND. AT TO FIND QUALITY STAFF TO RETAIN QUALITY STAFF- THIS IS REALLY REALLY INSTRUMENTAL- TO THEIR SUCCESS AND- SO I JUST WANNA. THANK MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AS WELL AS ALL THE ADVOCACY THAT HAS BEEN- GOING ON OVER THE AIR TO. TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE- AN INCREASE THAT WILL ALLOW FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO HAPPEN. AND WITHOUT SAID- I MOST RECENTLY SPOKE WITH THE DISTRICT TO IS REALLY THINKING OUTSIDE OF THE BOX THEY'RE VERY EXCITED TO. NOT ONLY SERVE ADDITIONAL STUDENTS- BUT TO ALSO PROVIDE INNOVATIVE AND- INNOVATIVE PROGRAMMING RELATIVE TO SCHEME ON MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE MEETING. THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS AND FAMILIES AND THEIR COMMUNITY AND WITH THE FOR THE FLEXIBILITY THAT WE HAD WITH THE EAST SAYS EARLY ON IN THE PANDEMIC. A LOT OF OUR PROGRAMS WERE ABLE TO SUPPORT STUDENTS AND FAMILIES IN WAYS THAT WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO IN THE PAST. AN EXAMPLE OF THIS IS- HAVING OUR STAFF- OUR FRONTLINE. STAFF AGE STUDENTS- WHO ARE IN. TO RUNNING PROGRAM AN AFFRONT LINE LEVEL WHO BUILT THE RELATIONS WITH THE STUDENTS THEY WERE MAKING CALLS HOME TO THE FAMILIES. I'M MAKING SURE THAT THEY WERE REALLY LISTENING TO THE NEEDS OF THE STUDENTS AND FAMILIES AND OUR COMMUNITIES TO ENSURE THAT THOSE NEEDS WERE BEING MAC. THIS IS WHERE WE SAW A LOT OF INCREASE IN- SOCIAL EMOTIONAL SUPPORT- MENTAL HEALTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. I'M CONNECTION TO- DIFFERENT TYPES OF OPPORTUNITIES THAT THAT OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE BEEN MADE AVAILABLE. AND SO I THINK MANY OF OUR DISTRICTS ARE REALLY LOOKING AT THE L. O. P. FUNDING AS A WAY TO CONTINUE THOSE SUPPORTS. I'M HAVING THE FLEXIBILITY HOPEFULLY TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT PERHAPS EVEN ON A FULL TIME BASIS OUR MOST OF OUR STAFF RIGHT NOW OR PART TIME. AND BUT IT DOES RAISE THE OF COURSE QUESTION- ANNA CONCERNED THAT HAS COME UP FOR MANY OF OUR DISTRICTS REGARDING THE NINE HOUR REQUIREMENT IN PARTICULAR. AND MOST ESPECIALLY DURING SUPPLEMENTAL AND MOST ESPECIALLY FOR OUR WORLD DISTRICTS. I'M THE MINIMUM BASE MINIMUM FUNDING AT FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR ONLINE OUR PROGRAM IS- YOU'RE GOING POSSIBLE. FOR MANY OF OUR RURAL COMMUNITIES AND OUR RURAL SMALL- CHECKER SITES. IT'S ESTIMATED IT TAKES ABOUT A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND TO TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS TO RUN A QUALITY PROGRAM- THAT INCLUDES ALL OF THE THAT CRAP AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SUPPLIES TO CREATE AND- I REALLY AND REGIONAL PROGRAM. I'M ALSO THE OPPORTUNITIES TO- CONTRACT WAS WITH HER PARTNERS YOU MIGHT BRING IN SOME OF THOSE ENRICHMENT COMPONENTS THAT STAFF MAY NOT BE ABLE TO DO. A RALLY IN PROGRAM THEMSELVES. SO IT DOES TAKE A COMMUNITY EFFORT- I WOULD URGE US ALL TO TAKE A LOOK- MARC CLOSELY AND DEEPLY. AT AS THE CHALLENGES THAT MAY OCCUR FOR A ROLES AND SMILES WITH THE MINIMUM- AS WELL AS THE INCREASED SUPPORTS FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WE DO YOU KNOW HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO MAKE SURE THAT. PEOPLE LIKE ME IN MY ROLE- pHER OUT THERE MAKING THE LOCAL CONNECTIONS AND BUILDING THE LOCAL RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR. VENDOR PARTNERS I'M- YOU REALLY ARE MORE THAN. THEY REALLY BE. COLLABORATIVE CLOUD. WITH SB PART OF OUR LEARNING. AND THEY'RE REALLY IN CALLED OF. MAKING OUR- AS THE HIGH QUALITY IS THE CAN BE. I'M I MAY STOP THEIR- AND THEN ENTERED CLASS- AS THEY OCCUR. I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU AGAIN ON BEHALF OF THE FIELD THAT I'M WE ARE WE ARE EXCITED ABOUT THIS OPPORTUNITY TO BRING BACK SCHEME BRING BACK- ALL OF THE- M. OUTDOOR LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES AND FIELD TRIPS IN PARTICULAR. I HEAR THAT A LOT WE WANT TO GET OUR KIDS OUT THERE AND EXPERIENCING NATURE WE WANT TO GET THEM OUT THERE AND EXPERIENCING OUR MUSEUMS AGAIN- AND REALLY PARTAKING IN OPPORTUNITIES THAT. REALLY EXPAND THEIR HORIZONS AND BUILT IT THAT QUALITY AND SKILLS THAT THEY NEED IN ORDER TO SURVIVE NOT ONLY ACADEMICALLY BUT SOCIALLY- DURING THEIR ACADEMIC CAREERS AND OF COURSE IN LIFE. SO AGAIN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME TODAY. OKAY THANK YOU. WE WILL NOW GO TO QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS ABOUT THIS ITEM WHO CAN FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS ALL START THIS MORNING- I WILL SAY THAT THIS IS A BUDGET PROPOSAL OF COURSE BUT THIS REALLY. IS A IMPLEMENTATION FROM LAST YEAR'S. A BUDGET AND WE TALK A LOT ABOUT HOW. LAST YEAR'S BUDGET WAS LIKE NO BUDGET EVER BEFORE WITH- YOU KNOW IT EXTENSIVE PROPOSAL AFTER PROPOSAL I'M NOT PROPOSAL BUT BUT- BASICALLY ACTIONS THAT- WE LOOK AT THE LIST YOU KNOW YOU FOCUS ON THE TOTALITY BUT ALL EVERYONE OF THEM COULD HAVE BEEN A ONCE IN A. GENERATION THING AND THIS IS ONE- UNIVERSAL AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS WHICH WE NOW WILL. NOT JUST HELP. KEEP KIDS SAFE AFTER SCHOOL BUT- WE FOCUS ON EXPANDED LEARNING I WILL NOTE THAT THAT MR FONG HI. I DO NOT WANT TO CALL IT ET L'APPAREIL ILIO WHATEVER LET'S JUST BE SIMPLE ITS AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS THAT THE PARENTS KNOW ABOUT IT. SO WHY WEEK COMPLICATING THINGS LIKE GOVERNMENT PEOPLE LIKE WE ARE SO WE SHOULD JUST GO BACK- TO THE FUTURE AND FOCUS ON CALLING IT WHAT IT REALLY IS IT'S AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS AND SO- I REALLY APPRECIATE THE- UNIVERSAL ASPECT OF THIS TOO. I THINK TO MANY- MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES GET SQUEEZED OUT AND IT'S TOUGH PAYING THE BILLS AND THE RENT AND EVERYTHING ELSE SO HAVING A UNIVERSAL AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM THROUGH OUR PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM. IS A BIG BIG WIN AND WE KNOW THAT IT'LL PAY DIVIDENDS FOR THAT- I CAN I SUCCESS OF OUR- AND SELL- BIG BIG SO. OF THE AND I WAS ONE OF OUR MOST POPULAR. ACTION ITEMS IN THIS IS OF COURSE IMPLEMENTATION SO I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS I WANT TO. DEPOSE ONE IS FOR THE- ADMINISTRATION FOR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE YOU YOU MAY HAVE SEEN THE QUESTIONS. IN THE AGENDA THERE'S A FEW OF THEM BUT THEY BUT RELATED TO THE OVERALL- AND RATES. AND WE HAVE SOME FOR- THE ASUS PROGRAM AND SOME FOR THE NEW PROGRAM AND- AND THERE'S JUST NOT- YOU KNOW. THE SECRET IS THE AND ALL THAT SO- WHY ARE WE COMPLICATING THINGS AND HAVE IT HAVING THESE- DIFFERENT RATES. WHEN I GRANT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- RATES WE WERE LOOKING AT WHAT THE STATUTE SAYS THE CAP AT JUST TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED PER ADA- AND THAT'S WHAT. WAS INCLUDED IN THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUT AT TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT. TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET ACTING MANY YEARS COMPUTERS- AND SO THE WAY THAT THE FUNDING WHEN OUT IN HERE ONE WITH IT WAS APPROXIMATELY A SIXTY FORTY SPLIT- SO 60% OF THE FUNDS PROVIDED IN THE FIRST YEAR OF THE PROGRAM WENT TO ELEAZAR ABOVE BATTER ABOVE 80% UCBCP. AND THE RED THE REMAINING FUNDS WENT TO THOSE BELOW AND IN THE END THAT WE YOU KNOW WE MODELED- A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT I'M KIND OF IN FUNDING RATES PER ADA- AND WE ENDED UP IN. VARIOUS OPTIONS FOR DIFFERENT UNDUPLICATED PEOPLE PERCENTILE CUT OFF AS WELL SO- WHAT WE LANDED AT IS THAT KEEPING IT KEEPING THE RATE ONE THE TIER ONE- AT TWENTY FIVE. HUNDRED AND PROVIDING A SIXTY FORTY SPLIT IN YEAR TWO OF THE PROGRAM- IF WE SHIFTED THAT WOULD BE DISTRIBUTED. D. FORTY SPLIT THAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR IT BUT IT ALSO ALLOWED US WITH THE BIGGER BUCKET OF MONEY SORRY THERE'S AN AIRPLANE GOING BY. ABOUT WITH THE WITH A FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION ONGOING VERSUS THE ONE BILLION. I'M GOING- THE FUNDING RATE EIGHTY FOUR THE TIER ONE AS A FIVE PER OR ABOVE WOULD BE A TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED AND A MUCH HIGHER FUNDING RATE. FOR THE TIER TWO- ORDER WAS BELOW SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT. UNDUPLICATED PEOPLE PERCENTAGE- THEY WOULD RECEIVE APPROXIMATELY TWO THOUSAND THAT EXACT. THAT EXACT NUMBER- WILL BE SUBJECT TO CHANGE THE BIRTH THE TWO THOUSAND THE SECOND NUMBER ONCE- ONCE THE CITY EVEN ACTUAL NUMBERS ARE REPORTED FOR ATTENDANCE- FROM CD BUT- THAT IS OUR ESTIMATE RIGHT NOW. AND THEN HOW DOES THIS RELATE TO WHAT THE- THAT SO THIS IS THE RIGHT THIS ISN'T A TOLERATE SO THIS IS THE RATE. THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED FROM THE STATE PERSON STATE AND THEN THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE. PARENT FEES I GUESS MATCH WOULD BE. BUT BUT THE WOULD BE NECESSARY TO FILL. THE FELLOW BACK ENTIRELY IS THIS AN ADEQUATE AMOUNT FROM THE STATE'S PERSPECTIVE TO MAKE SURE WE DON'T HAVE. YOU KNOW BURDENSOME FEES- ESPECIALLY WHEN WE KNOW THAT. WE HAVE MINIMUM WAGE INCREASES AND POTENTIAL ANOTHER ONE LOOMING. SO IN A MAKE SURE THESE PENCIL OUT AND ANSWERED OF FAMILIES. YEAH THE WAY THAT THE PROGRAM IS CURRENTLY- STRUCTURED WAY WE ENVISION IT IN THE STATUTE IS THAT IT IS- PROVIDED REGARDLESS- REGARDLESS OF COMMUNITY DEMOGRAPHICS ALL PARENTS WILL HAVE ACCESS TO THIS LOW COST IT'LL BE ANOTHER SLIDING FEE SCALE SIMILAR TO THE WAY A SENSE AND- TWENTY FIRST CENTURY IS STRUCTURED. TWENTY FIRST CENTURY PROGRAMMING INSTRUCTOR. AND THE DIFFERENCE WITH THAT YELLOW P. PROGRAM. I'M GETTING BETTER AT SAYING NOT SAYING YOU OP- SO THE DIFFERENCE AT THAT IS THAT- THIS PROGRAM IS FUNDED- BASED ON YOU PP ATTENDANCE AT THE L. EA. SO IT'S AT BUT IT'S NOT. THE FUNDING OF THE PROVIDING FOR PARTICIPATION IN THE PROGRAM SPECIFICALLY SO YOU GET A HIGHER FUNDING RATE SINCE THE FUNDING IS BASED ON THAT ELEAZAR YOU PP. OKAY AND THEN LET'S LET'S GO ON TO THE UNIVERSAL ASPECT OF IT I THINK THAT'S ONE THING THAT THE MEMBERS REALLY APPRECIATE WHETHER IT'S BEST. FOR TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN IS HAVING A PROGRAM THAT'S FOR EVERYBODY- SO YOU DON'T SQUEEZE OUT. MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES WHO YOU KNOW ARE JUST TOO RICH TO QUALIFY FOR FREE BUT DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY FOR IT THEY THE PROGRAM THEMSELVES. SO THAT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING IS VERY ATTRACTIVE TO US SO HOW DO WE ANTICIPATE. THAT THIS REVIEW- BEING IMPLEMENTED TO MAKE TO MAKE SURE IT'S UNIVERSAL FOR ALL KIDS IN CALIFORNIA. I THINK THE QUESTION IS FOR ME AGAIN YOU'RE GONNA. AT- SO. THE WAY THAT THE WE ENVISION THIS PROGRAM WORKING WE SEE IT AS A COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM THAT IS THAT BRAIDS KIND OF THE ASUS PROGRAM THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY FUNDS THAT- ELLIE IS RECEIVED AND BECAUSE FIVE YOU KNOW AT LEAST RECEIVE FUNDING THROUGH THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA THEY CAN LEVERAGE. OTHER SOURCES OF FUNDING TO SUPPLEMENT- THE AVAILABILITY OF PROGRAMMING FOR EXTENDED LEARNING SERVICES- BECAUSE LIKE I LIKE I SAID AT THE BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS IT FUNDED BASED ON STUDENT PARTICIPATION. THE EFFECTIVE FUNDING RATE PER STUDENT WAS REALLY GONNA DEPEND ON THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS THAT RECEIVE ACCESS TO THE PROGRAM- AND I THINK OUR ESTIMATES AND ELLY ELLS ESTIMATES SUGGEST THAT A LIKELY BE ENOUGH TO SUPPORT PROVIDE ACCESS. 62% OF ALL KIDS T. THREE T. K. THREE SIX UP ON GLOBAL IMPLEMENTATION AND THAT WOULD COVER ALL- AND DUPLICATED PEOPLE PEOPLE'S. ALL RIGHT CAN I GET A MISTER FUNK ON THE ON THE IS YES- MAY YOU COULD ADDRESS THE TO TWO ISSUES THAT FIRST ONE IS- THE UNIVERSAL PERSPECTIVE. FOR ALL KIDS IN CALIFORNIA HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE DELIVERED THE PROMISE FROM. OUR LAST YEAR'S BUDGET ACTION. IT'S A IT'S- AS WE'VE GOT- A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF LIAISE LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES THAT HAVE NEVER OPERATED AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS BEFORE THEY HAVEN'T HAD ANY SINCE OUR TWENTY FIRST CENTURY FUNDING. AND QUITE FRANKLY OF MANY OF THEM ARE ASKING IF THEY HAVE TO DO THIS THEY HAVE TO TAKE THE BODY AND SO ARE BIG CHALLENGE HAS BEEN. TO MATCH UP THESE NEW LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES WHICH QUITE FRANKLY HAVE A LOT OF THINGS ON THEIR PLATE RIGHT NOW WITH ALL THE CHALLENGES OF STAFF IN SCHOOLS IN KEEPING SCHOOLS OPEN AND THE OVERCROWDED AND THE CHALLENGES AND TO GET THEM TO THINK OF AN AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM HAS BEEN A CHALLENGE. BUT WE'RE DOING WE'RE TRYING TO MATCH. DISTRICTS WHO ARE RELUCTANT. OR HESITANT. PASSED WITH DISTRICTS YOU REALLY HAVE A VISION FOR OUR AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS AND EXPANDED LEARNING PROGRAMS. CAN BE A CRITICAL ELEMENT TO SUPPORT EQUITY TO SUPPORT- OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS WHO HAVE NOT HAVE THE UP THE ADVANTAGES. SO- THE AND THIS DOES DOES BLEED INTO THE- THE QUESTION ABOUT THE RATES. BECAUSE OF IS TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS. TO GET STUDENT ENOUGH TO MAKE THIS UNIVERSAL FOR THOSE WHO ARE IN TIER ONE THE PROPOSAL A 5% AND ABOVE AND TO PUT IT. THE CLEANER FROM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WAS ACCURATE. THAT IT ALL DEPENDS ON HOW MANY STUDENTS COME AND RIGHT NOW WE HAVE LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES. WHO ARE MODELING THINGS OUT. AND SOMEONE JUST THROWING UP THEIR HANDS AND SAY THIS IS NOT ENOUGH MONEY IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK. BECAUSE THEY ARE CALCULATING- THEY'RE CALCULATING IF EVERY STUDENT THAT CAN COME WILL COME WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE ENOUGH MONEY AND WE'RE TRYING TO GET FOLKS TO UNDERSTAND THAT THAT'S NOT LIKELY TO HAPPEN I MEAN I'VE BEEN IN THIS WORK. AS YOU KNOW MISTER CHAIRMAN FOR ABOUT THIRTY YEARS TWENTY YEARS IN THE BAY AREA ENGINEERS HERE AT CD. AND- UNIVERSAL DOES NOT BE UNIVERSAL ACCESS DOES NOT MEAN THAT EVERY STUDENT CAN COME WILL IT JUST DOESN'T DOESN'T MEET THE NEEDS FOR SOME FAMILIES. SO RIGHT NOW- I THINK THE WAY TO GET TO UNIVERSAL. IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE DISTRICTS HAVE COACHING. UNDERSTAND HOW TO DEVELOP A HIGH QUALITY AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM THAT KIDS WILL WANT TO ATTEND AND PARENTS WILL WANT THEIR CHILDREN TO EXPAND ITS- THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN THROUGH AN OCCASIONAL WEAPON. IS NOT GONNA HAPPEN THROUGH A TOOL KIT. IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN THROUGH- ONE VISIT IT'S GOING TO TAKE COACHING IT'S GONNA TAKE RELATIONSHIPS IT'S GONNA TAKE MENTORING. MARVELED ON THE LINE HERE FROM THE OFFICE OF MAURY COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION. IS PART OF OUR SYSTEM OF SUPPORT FOR EXPANDED LEARNING- WE BELIEVE THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME ADDITIONAL SUPPORT NETWORK COVERAGE IN ALL THE SYSTEMS. MISTER CHAIRMAN- WITH CC EAGER PARTNERSHIP WITH A CALIFORNIA SCHOOL NETWORK COMMUTER WELL. AND WE'RE LEVERAGING ALL THE SYSTEMS THE SMALL THE SMALL SCHOOL DISTRICT ASSOCIATE. AXTA ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS- WE'RE PRESENTING A CONFERENCE AT THE CURRICULUM INSTRUCTION SYMPOSIUM THIS WEEK. TO DO COACHING AND MENTORING. BUT IT'S GONNA TAKE A VERY COMPREHENSIVE ROBUST EFFORT OF SUPPORTING COACHING. TO MAKE THIS UNIVERSAL IT'S JUST NOT GONNA HAPPEN BECAUSE WE M DGET. YEAH YOU YOU BROUGHT UP A POINT I WANNA FOCUS ON A BIT AND THIS IS REALLY TOWARDS THE RATE STRUCTURE- AND I COMPLETELY AGREE YEAH. ALL THESE THINGS WERE DOING IN THIS IN THIS BUDGET FRANKLY IT'S- IT'S NOT THE MONEY IT'S IMPLEMENTATION PUT THIS IN CHILDCARE AND T. K. AND- A LOT OF OUR COMMUNITY SCHOOLS WE HAVEMONEY'S NOT THE ISSUE IT'S MAKING SURE WE IMPLEMENT THEM RIGHTS YOU COULD OPEN A BUNCH OF AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS AND- YOU DOORS WIDE OPEN SAY COME ON IN IF IT'S A- IF IT'S A CRUMMY PROGRAM. PEOPLE ARE GONNA WALK WITH OUR FEET AND NOT PARTICIPATE. AND ONE THING IS THE IS THE- THE SALARIES AND WAGES FOR THE WORKERS WE SEE THIS WITH- EARLY AT THE END OF THE SUMMER RACE AND I WORKING ON REIMBURSEMENT RATES FOR EARLY AND FOR AFTER SCHOOL. I KNOW JUST FOR MY OWN KIDS. THEIR NON ELEMENTARY SCHOOL THEY HAD AT. THEIR PROGRAM HERE BEFORE THE PANDEMIC. AND THEY WENT THROUGH A LOT OF STAFF HERE IN THERE BECAUSE THAT THE- WORKERS. YOU KNOW IF PRODUCTION- LEAGUE COLLEGE STUDENTS ARE YOU KNOW. LATE TEENS EARLY TWENTIES. THEY COULD MAKE MORE GOING AND WORKING AT STARBUCKS OR YOU KNOW SOMEWHERE ELSE. THAN THEY COULD. IN THIS AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM. AND THE CDVA UTILIZZARE YOUR PAST ASSET WHICH IS YOUR WORKFORCE. SO DO YOU DO YOU THINK. THAT THEIR RATES WE HAVE HERE. ARE SUFFICIENT TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE. HIGH QUALITY PROGRAMS WE CAN BRING IN THE COACHING OTHERS TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE- STABILIZED AND VALUABLE FOR THE COMMUNITIES THEY THEY'RE THEY'RE TEND TO SERVE. I'LL TAKE THAT A TUTOR FOR WAYS MISTER. FIRST OF ALL AS LEADER FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE MENTIONED IT IS THE INTENT. THAT ACES IN TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. M. THE EXPELLER IN OPPORTUNITIES PROGRAM IS ONE COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM THIS IS TAKEN A BIT FOR. LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES TO GET THEIR HEAD AROUND- BUT INSTEAD OF THINKING OF BASIS TWENTY FIRST CENTURY AND ELO P. EVEN IF THEY'RE STRUCTURED SOMEWHAT DIFFERENTLY. I SEE A CLEAR WAY THE DATES CAN BE CONSIDERED. THREE DIFFERENT FUNDING STREAMS FOR ONE COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM AND IN SO DOING- WE CAN INCREASE. THE AMOUNT OF THE WAGES AB AND PAY PEOPLE MORE AT THE SENATE HEARING- ANY READING FROM YOUR UNIFIED HAVE TALKED ABOUT HOW THEY'RE THEY'RE GOING USE THIS ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE GIVING OUT RATE INCREASES FOR PAY FOR STAFF AND FOR SITE COORDINATORS- SOME MEDIA ORGANIZATIONS ARE NOW CONSIDERING CAN WE BRING OUR CYCLE COORDINATORS ON AS A FULL TIME. POSITION MAYBE EVEN WITH BENEFITS SO THIS BECOMES MORE OF A CAREER PATH. I THINK THE CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW THESE. STREAMS BLEND TOGETHER- IS WORTH A LOT OF CONVERSATION MAYBE NOT FOR THIS HEARING BUT WE'RE AS WE WORK WITH- FINANCE AND LEGISLATIVE STAFF WE HAVE SOME IDEAS OF MAYBE SOME TWEAKS THAT NEED TO HAPPEN IN THE ACES AND CODE IN TWENTY FIRST CENTURY TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE CAN BE MORE COMPATIBLE THERE FUNDAMENTALLY STRUCTURED IN DIFFERENT FUNDING MODELS WERE WITH ACES IT'S VERY CLEAR YOU'VE GOT A DAILY RATE PER CHILD YOU'VE GOT ATTENDANCE. GOALS THAT ARE SET BY STATE YOU YOUR TARGET GOALS ARE FOR ATTENDANCE AND YELLOW PIAS VERY MUCH ABOUT OCT- ACCESS AND- PROVIDING OPPORTUNITIES BUT ATTENDANCE IS LEFT TO THE DISCRETION OF THE FAMILY. THE SECOND POINT THOUGH I THINK THAT TERMS OF WORK FORCE BECAUSE THAT IS THE ISSUE THAT IS THE UNIVERSAL. CHALLENGE WE'RE HEARING FROM SMALLER DISTRICTS RURAL LARGE DISTRICTS IS WORKFORCE AND THAT'S NOT DISSIMILAR TO IN THE INDUSTRY. IN IN OUR COUNTRY. OR THE WORLD TRYING TO MATCH WHAT IS YOUR HOURLY RAGE IN COMPETITION WITH STARBUCKS. OR SOME OTHER- BUSINESS NOT TO PLUG ANYONE BUSINESS BUT- ALL BUSINESSES PULLING OUT THE STOPS TO MAKE THEIR BUSINESS MORE ATTRACTIVE HIGHER WAGE MORE BENEFITS. WE'RE GOING TO LOSE THAT COMPETITION. BUT IF WE FRAME THIS. AS NOT JUST. A LIVABLE AND MORE THAN LIVABLE WAGE. BUT AS A ENTRY POINT AND GATEWAY TO A CAREER IN EDUCATION. THAT WE CAN MAKE EXPANDED LEARNING TIME COUNT FOR TEACHER PREPARATION HOURS- WE'VE BEEN DOING SOME WORK WITH. THE CREDENTIALING FOLKS IN WITH HIGHER EDUCATION. SO THE STAFF PERSON CAN GET CREDIT TOWARDS THEIR TEACHER PREPARATION FOR THE TIME THEY SPEND. IT WORKING EXPAND AS OUR NEEDS- EXPANDED LEARNING ACTUALLY COURSE AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS. ARE NOT JUST AFTER SCHOOL THEY ARE PART OF THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM. L. FOR. YOUR ADULTS OLDER ADULTS ALL TYPES OF PEOPLE WHO ARE CONSIDERING SOME TYPE OF CRUDE EDUCATION THIS BECOMES THE PORTAL THROUGH WHICH THEY CAN NOT ONLY LIVE AND GET A MEANINGFUL WAGE I HAVE EXPERIENCED TAKEN TOWARDS THEIR CAREER PATH. THANK YOU THEN THE LAST QUESTION IS- I THINK IT IS A BIT CONFUSING WITH ALL OF OUR AFTER SCHOOL INVESTMENTS AND AGAIN I'D LIKE TO SIMPLIFY AND CALL IT AFTER SCHOOL. PROGRAMS THAT'S WHAT IT IS THAT'S WHAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS NOTED THAT'S WHAT PARENTS NOWADAYS. BUT ALL THESE FUNDING STREAMS WE HAVE WE HAVE. A SAYS THROUGH PROP FORTY NINE AND TOWARDS THEIR GRIP ON THE BALLOT IN TWO THOUSAND JEWISH I GUESS- THEN WE HAVE THE FEDERAL MONEY FROM THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY AND THEN WE HAVE THE EXPANDED LEARNING GRANTS. IT WOULD BE A DISASTER IF THESE GO OUT AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE. YOU KNOW- BASICALLY- OFFERING THESE AND ALL THESE DIFFERENT ACRONYMS AND I THINK IT'S SUPER CONFUSING SO WHAT ARE WE DOING AT THE DEPARTMENT OF AD AND LEVEL I KNOW I LEGISLATION ON THIS BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK AS FAR AS JUST STREAMLINING AND HAVING. WHAT THREE POTS OF MONEY GO AND HAVE ONE SIMPLIFIED. OPPORTUNITY FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO OFFER AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS. BUT A VERY BASIC LEVEL BECAUSE IN THIS CURRENT MOMENT IN TIME WE STILL HAVE THE DIFFERENT FUNDING STREAMS WITH DIFFERENT SECTIONS OF THE CODE OF COURSE THERE'S A CORRELATION WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE AS I MENTIONED EARLIER. WE ARE DOING A FINE. EDUCATIONAL LEADERS WHO HAVE FIGURED OUT HOW TO LAND THE STREAMS TOGETHER AND BRING THEM TOGETHER INTO ONE COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM. AND WERE ELEVATED THAT WERE INTERVIEWING THEM ONLINE WERE WERE. PRODUCING VIDEO BLOGS WHERE THEY'RE TELLING THEIR STORY WE'RE PROVIDING PLACES. WHERE PEOPLE CAN GATHER AND GOING TO BREAK OUT GROUPS DISTRICTS WHO HAVE QUESTIONS WHO ARE STRUGGLING MATCHING THEM WITH DISTRICS WHO HAVE FIGURED THIS OUT- AND THERE ARE SOME TWEAKS WE NEED TO MAKE UP. IN TERMS OF BUT I THINK WHAT YOU'RE REALLY ASKING MISTER CHAIRMAN IS LIKE. WHAT IS THE FUTURE OF THIS IS A TWENTY FIRST CENTURY OF COURSE TWENTY FOR CENTURIES A FEDERAL PROGRAM. AND THERE ARE LIMITATIONS TO WHAT CHANGES WE CANMAKE THERE SOME SOME STATE IMPLEMENTATION FLEXIBILITY AS WELL. AND MANY IN THE- AFTER SCHOOL UNIVERSE. HAVE RAISE THE CONCERN THAT BECAUSE THE EVIL PROGRAMS THAT FOCUS ON T. K. THREE SIX. THAT ARE OLDER YOUTH MIGHT BE GETTING- DOCUMENTS THEY NEED OUR MIDDLE SCHOOL PROGRAM USE THAT ARE HIGH SCHOOL HOUSTON SO. WE'RE CERTAINLY OPEN TO CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW. TO WORK WITH THESE FUNDING STREAMS IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE I THINK- YOUR INSTINCTS ARE CORRECT. THE FACT THAT WE HAVE THREE DIFFERENT FUNDING STREAMS THREE ACRONYMS WE'VE WE'VE BEEN TRAINING IN OUR EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES FOR A LONG TIME. TO KEEP THINGS SEPARATE DON'T MIX THINGS UP KEEP THINGS IN SILOS THAT WAY YOU'RE GONNA FOLLOW ALL THE RULES YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET IN TROUBLE. AND THAT'S NOT GOOD FOR KIDS IT'S NOT GOOD FOR FAMILIES IN IS CONFUSING FOR PARENTS. SO WE'RE VERY OPEN TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW. TO MAKE SURE. THAT YOU KNOW I I'M ALWAYS. I'M ALWAYS GONNA SAY WHAT OUR PARENTS AND STUDENTS NEED AND WHAT'S GOING TO BE MOST BENEFICIAL FOR THAT IS WHERE WE SHOULD FOCUS AND OF CREATING SOMETHING THAT'S LESS CONFUSING AND WHEN THEY LOOK AT THEIR SCHOOL THEY SEE. ONE THE HIGH QUALITY AFTER SCHOOL SUMMER PROGRAM YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE ACRONYMS WHAT IS CALLED- I SUPPORT SLIDING FEES ARE NOT A BIG PROPONENT OF SOMETHING THAT'S HEAVILY BASED ON SLIDING FEES BECAUSE OUR FAMILIES AS YOU'VE SAID OR STRESSED ENOUGH. SO WE'RE OPEN TO THIS CONVERSATION AND HOW TO WORK TOGETHER SO OUR FAMILIES CAN SEE. I QUALITY AFTER SCHOOL SOMETHING THAT'S PART OF THEIR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM. OKAY THANK YOU THAT THAT'S IT FOR ME- MISTER O'DONNELL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- LISTEN I LOVE AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS I DON'T LOVE THIS PROPOSAL. AND I CAN EXPLAIN WHY- THIS IS AN AWFULLY EXPENSIVE PROGRAM. THAT WE ARE SEEKING TO CREATE. OUR CLASSROOMS ARE ALREADY UNDER FUNDED. UNDER THE PROPOSAL BEFORE STILL BE MORE UNDERFUNDED IF YOU WILL- BUT WE'RE CREATING NEW PROGRAMS IT'S LIKE THE KITCHENS ON FIRE. BUT WORRIED ABOUT THE DRAPES IN THE LIVING ROOM- AGAIN LOVE AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS BUT THIS IS A VERY EXPENSIVE PROGRAM WITH ONGOING MONEY. THAT DRIVES DOLLARS AWAY FROM THE CLASSROOM. I SAY THIS IS A PARENT A TEACHER CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY EDUCATION COMMITTEE I JUST DON'T FEEL THAT THIS IS RESPONSIBLE BUDGETING- AND I CAN EXPLAIN WHY LET'S FIRST GO TO THE DOLLARS THIS YEAR THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET. HAS A FIVE POINT 33% COHEN. YET ONGOING EXPENDITURES TO DISTRICTS. ARE ABOUT THIRTEEN POINT 85% WHEN YOU TAKE IN THE CPI OF SEVEN POINT FIVE K. INCREASES TO STIRS AND PURSE RATES OF THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS WILL BE BURDENED WITH NEXT YEAR AT ABOUT 4% OF OTHER COSTS WHICH ARE A MIX AND DON'T APPLY TO ALL DISTRICTS EVENLY DECLINING ENROLLMENT CODE RELATED INTERRUPT IN ATTENDANCE. THE SPECIAL ITEM- HUMAN RESOURCES ISSUES- EXTENDED SICK LEAVE PAY EXCEPT RENDON OTHER COSTS AS WELL SO AGAIN FIVE POINT THREE THREE IS IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET YEAH THE ACTUALLY PROBABLY CLOSER TO THIRTEEN POINT 8% AND WHAT WE WANT TO GO OUT AND DO. WHAT I'M HEARING TODAY SOME TO DO IS GO OUT CREATE VERY EXPENSIVE NEW PROGRAMS AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE. YOU KNOW. THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF ON GOING MONEY. ON AND THEN WHEN WE LOOK AT THE AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS THE QUALITY VARIES QUITE FRANKLY THESE ARE OFTEN COLLEGE KIDS. GREAT KIDS GETTING EXPERIENCE- WITH OTHER KIDS AND THE YOUNGER KIDS THAT'S A GOOD THING. BUT AGAIN WE I THINK THE QUALITIES- WE DON'T KNOW THE QUALITY QUITE FRANKLY THE QUALITY CONTROL ISSUES ARE THERE- I DON'T WANT TO YOU KNOW SOMETHING LIKE THIS COULD JUST END UP BEING BABYSITTING AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS RIGHT CAN BE THAT THEY AREN'T ALWAYS THAT BUT THEY CAN BE THAT. AND AGAIN WHEN WE DRIVE MONEY AWAY FROM STUDENTS IN THE CLASSROOM I THINK THAT'S AN UNFORTUNATE THING I DON'T THINK THIS IS TOTALLY. BEEN THOUGHT THROUGH. SO QUESTION FOR FINANCE- WHY- FIRST QUESTION IS THIS A- IS THIS A LOT PROGRAM IS THIS PERMISSIVE OR. IS IT A MANDATE ON SCHOOL DISTRICTS. LENA GRANT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- THE REQUIREMENTS THERE'S NO OPT OUT OPTION FOR THIS PROGRAM. BUT THERE IS THERE'S NOT I'M SORRY. THERE IS NOT THERE WILL BE AN OP OPT OUT OPTION FOR THESE PROGRAMS BUT I WANT TO JUST CLARIFY THAT THERE ARE. THERE ARE. OFFERING REQUIREMENTS AND THERE'S PROVIDING ACCESS REQUIREMENTS IN EITHER OF THOSE. KICK IN UNTIL. AT LEAST TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR WE PUSH IT OUT A YEARS TO PROVIDE SOME IMPLEMENTATION TIME FOR LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES. SO THERE WILL BE THE REQUIREMENT IF YOU'RE A FUNDED AT THE HIGHER RATE TO. PROVIDE ACCESS TO PROVIDE OFFER AND PROVIDE ACCESS TO ALL ON A DUPLICATED PEOPLE'S RATE. IT WILL BE TO OFFER TO ALL AND PROVIDE ACCESS 250% LOOKING AT PEOPLE'S. GREAT THANK YOU WILL THIS AGAIN SHOWS THE DISCONNECT BETWEEN THE CLASSROOM LISTEN I'VE BEEN A SCHOOLS I HAVE A DAUGHTER. THAT'S IN HIGH SCHOOL I SUB IN THE FALL I SAW WHAT WAS GOING ON OUR SCHOOLS THEY CAN GET PEOPLE IN THE DOOR. STUDENTS OR STAFF. AND YET WE'RE GOING TO TELL SCHOOL DISTRICTS HERE. HERE'S ANOTHER MANDATE FOR YOU GLAD CREATE THIS HOPE THIS HUGE PROGRAM. AND DISTRICTS DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES THE CAPACITY. TO DO THAT RIGHT NOW. YEAH I SPEAK FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AND I SPEAK FROM WHAT I'M HEARING ON THE GROUND FROM SCHOOL DISTRICTS. PLEASE DON'T GIVE US NEW PROGRAMS NEXT YEAR WE'RE HAVING TROUBLE. CONDUCTING OUR CORE MISSION NOW. AND SO I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO- IS IT. THAT WAY. THIS DOES NOT RE BENCH NINETY EIGHT. EITHER DOES IT THIS THIS NEW PROGRAM WE'RE NOT REINVENTING NINETY EIGHT TO ADD IN THIS PROGRAM CORRECT. FOR FINANCE. NO I'M SORRY MY COLLEAGUE ERIN HER IDEA I THINK WE'LL ANSWER. OKAY THE ANSWER WAS NO CORRECT. YES ERIN YOUR CURRENT CREDIT LIMIT AB RIGHT AFTER YEAH NOW WE'RE NOT OKAY THANK YOU DOCTOR AND I THOUGHT IF I FIND THAT UNFORTUNATE- AND AGAIN I THINK THERE'S A QUESTION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THIS USE OF THE MONEY IS EVEN LEGAL. IF IT IS PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT APPROPRIATE BECAUSE AGAIN IT IS BEING SPENT OUT OF THE DAY OUT OF THE SCHOOL DAY AND OUT OF THE CLASSROOM LISTEN I GET WHY NONPROFIT TO LOVE THIS BECAUSE THIS IS PROBABLY A LOT OF MONEY FOR THEM. RIGHT A LOT OF THESE- PROGRAMS WE CONDUCTED I'D MAYBE EVEN ALL WITH TIME- AND IT WITH WITH PERSONAL OTHER THAN SCHOOL SITE PERSONAL- BUT AGAIN I GOT A QUESTION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S EVEN AN APPROPRIATE AND EVEN LEGAL USE OF THE MONEY- WITH THAT. I WILL TURN IT BACK TO YOU MISTER CHAIR. OKAY THANK YOU I. JUST WANT YOU. ALL LEGIT THIS IS LAST A PART AS IMPLEMENTING YEAR'S LAST YEAR I DON'T SEE IT THAT WAY SIR THE FIRM HAS. I MEAN I'M LOOKING AT WHAT THE SITUATION WE'RE FACING TODAY IN THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL SYSTEM NOT NOT. THE SITUATIONS WE'VE FACED IN THE PAST. YEAH WE'RE JUST TO REPEAT THAT THIS LAST YEAR'S TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT BOTH BUT IT'S THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. THAT IS THE MONEY IS BUT WE SET WE PUT IN STATUTE AGAIN AT THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. AND ARE WE ARE NOT BOUND BY ANY PASSED ACTION EVERY YEAR IS A ONE YEAR CONTRACT OR BUDGET YEAH THAT'S TRUE. OKAY. FURTHER QUESTIONS. OKAY SEEING NINE WE WILL CIRCLE MISTER TANK. THANKS MATURE APPRECIATED PROPITIATE MA ARE EDUCATION CHAIRS. COMMENTS AND THOUGHTS I HAVE I HAVE A LITTLE BIT- DIFFERENT- FOUR OF- VANTAGE POINT GUARDS TWENTY DIFFERENT MINDSET- I REALLY LOOK AT NOW SCHOOLS WERE DESIGNED AT A TIME- IN A VERY DIFFERENT PLACE YOU KNOW WE TAKE SUMMERS OFF SCHOOLS WERE DESIGNED WE GO TO SCHOOL BETWEEN NINETY TWO- FAMILIES WERE DIFFERENT WE DIDN'T HAVE THE SAME KIND OF WORK SCHEDULES NOW- MOST FAMILIES. WHO HAVE CHILDREN YOU HAVE TO WORKING PARENTS THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO COME PICK UP THEIR KIDS AT TWO O'CLOCK- THEY HAVE DIFFICULTY WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO WITH OUR KIDS ALL SUMMER BECAUSE WE EVERYONE'S WORKING SO THE VISION I THINK THAT MR FONG CLEAN AND YOU KNOW I HAD THE DISTINCT HONOR OF- KNOWING HIM WHEN HE RAN ARE GREAT- BEACON PROGRAM IN MY DISTRICT. MANY MANY YEARS AGO BUT- YOU KNOW REALLY THE VISION THAT HE LAID OUT WHICH IS YOU HAVE A SCHOOL DAY THAT IS REALLY FROM NINE O'CLOCK UNTIL FIVE O'CLOCK AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY WHAT FAMILIES NEED AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT FAMILIES WANT AND IF YOU LOOK AT WORKING FAMILIES ARE MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES OR FAMILIES WHO HAVE TO. WORKING PARENTS THAT REALLY IS THE LONG TERM VISION I THINK OF WHERE WE HAVE TO GO SO IT'S REALLY NOT ABOUT- THIS NOT ABOUT WAS RELEASED THE MONEY AT THE SCHOOL. AND WHETHER IT IS- AFTER THE BELL RINGS OR BEFORE THE BELL RINGS IT'S REALLY ALL ABOUT. MAKING SURE THAT FAMILIES AND CHILDREN ARE REALLY GETTING THAT SUPPORT SO JUST A COUPLE COUPLE QUESTIONS- STARTING WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE OBVIOUSLY I THINK OUR OUR SUB CHAIR. ON REITERATED THIS POINT- THAT THIS IS JUST REITERATE THIS IS JUST A- IMPLEMENTATION OF LAST YEAR'S- BUDGET AGREEMENT. BUT IT IS A DIFFERENT DEPARTMENT OF- FINANCES VANTAGE POINT WITH THE INCREASED TO FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION OBVIOUSLY WITH THE GOAL OF. FIVE BILLION- WHAT'S THE EXPECTATION THAT THAT THE YOUR EXPECTING. IN TERMS OF IMPLEMENTATION WHAT YOU'D LIKE TO SEE THIS YEAR. LENA GRANT APARTMENT OF FINANCE BASING IT BUT YOU'RE ASKING IF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF IF THAT WAS GONNA BE FULLY IMPLEMENTED BY THE END OF THIS BUDGET YEAR. I THINK OUR VISION AS- PER STATUTE IT'S TO RAMP UP TO THE FIVE BILLION ONGOING- RIGHT NOW WE'RE AT FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION I'M GOING- WE HAVE INCREASED THE PER ADA RATE TO REFLECT THIS INCREASE AND- YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE PROVIDING SOME BUFFER TIME FOR LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES TO BE ABLE TO RAMP UP THEIR OFFERINGS- SO WE SEE THE IMPLEMENTATION HAPPENING OVER A FEW YEARS- AND- THE AUDIT. YOU KNOW BEING PUSHED OUT- TO KIND OF REFLECT THAT. WHAT ARE THE MASKING MORE FROM A LADY- LEE PERSONS- WE ARE WHAT ARE WE GOING TO SEE. ON SITE AT THE SCHOOL LEVEL. WE'RE PUTTING ALL THIS MONEY INTO THE STATE INTO THIS- PROGRAM WHAT ARE WE WHAT ARE WE GOING TO SEE WHAT OUR FAMILIES ARE SAFE. I DON'T ARE YOU AT AND I'M NOT SURE I UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION EXACTLY WHERE WHERE'S THE MONEY GOING TO GO. HOW TO BE SPENT. ABOUT THE- YES SIR SO I THINK. WHAT YOU'RE ASKING IS HOW HOUSE HOW SCHOOLS WILL USE THE FUNDING TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO STUDENTS AND HOW PARENTS ARE GONNA SEE THIS PROGRAM. CORRECT WHAT'S WHAT'S DEPARTMENT FRANCES EXPECTATION FROM THAT IS. WELL OUR INTENT IS THAT IS THAT SCHOOLS- THAT RECEIVE THE FUNDS ARE ABLE TO RAMP UP OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS- TO IMPLEMENT THEIR OFFERINGS FOR EXPANDED LEARNING- AND BUT THERE IS NO THERE WILL BE KIND OF- YOU KNOW THE REQUIREMENT WILL STAND BUT THERE WILL BE AN AUDIT TO CHECK THAT THIS IS HAPPENING BUT THE FUNDING WILL BE AVAILABLE. ANY ANY UNSPENT FUNDS FROM TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO THEY WILL HAVE UNTIL TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE TO USE THOSE AND SIMILAR SURE OF ANSWERING QUESTION I DON'T THINK IT IS THE QUESTION. SO LET ME JUST REPEAT IT AGAIN- EUROPE WHAT I THINK OF RAMP UP I GUESS WE'RE- FOR TALKING A SLICK I THINK THE SKATEBOARD PARK BUT I DON'T THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO SO WHEN YOU SAY RAMP UP WHAT DO YOU. YOUR YOUR THE ANALYSTS WHERE WOULD YOU CAN LOOK FOR. DID AND IT. WILL TO GIVE GRANT WILL HELP HER. EIGHT DEPARTMENT OF YEAH SO I THINK THE QUESTION AND- CERTAINLY WARRANT- OF COURSE RIGHT A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT THROUGHOUT THIS AND I THINK- A CALL TO YOU NEED SPOKE TO THAT QUITE A PER. WHERE AND HAVE YOU HEARD ARE OUR PANEL AT- I BELIEVE FROM FOR MODERATE AREA EARLIER WELL AS YOU TO- THERE'S DIFFERENT RIGHT CALIFORNIA'S VERY DIVERSE WELL THAT AND SO- DIFFERENT LEDS ARE GOING TO HAVE DIFFERENT CHALLENGES- SOME OF THEM ARE GOING TO BE ALREADY PARTICIPATING IN THE ASUS PROGRAMS YOU CAN PUNK THERE THEY'RE GONNA HAVE A EASIER TIME PERHAPS BREEDING FONG FROM DIFFERENT PROGRAMS GRADING ONE COHESIVE. AS WE MISS MCCARTY SAID AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM RIGHT THAT PARENTS WOULD KNOW THAT- EVEN THOUGH THE FUNDING FROM A STATE PERSPECTIVE COMING FROM DIFFERENT PARTS MAYBE EVEN FEDERAL FUNDS AS WELL. SO THAT'S REALITY AND SO IT'S HARD FOR US TO FIND IN THE EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING TO LOOK INTO YOU KNOW YOUR DISTRICT NUMBER CISCO UNIFIED VERSUS SOMEWHERE IN MONTEREY OR WHATEVER- SO THAT IT IS DIFFICULT PRESS REALLY GIVE US THE GAS I THINK OUR VISION OUR HOLD RIGHT IS THAT- WITH A LOT WORK THAT MEANT MR FONG AND HIS DOING AND SEE. OPERA MEDICAL ASSISTANCE LIAISON- RIGHT BASIS THAT BY THE END OF THIS CURRENT YEAR AND CERTAIN IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE WITH THE ADDITION THE IN OF- THE L. YOU COULD GET TO A- WHERE THEY DO HAVE PROGRAMS THAT ARE UP AND RUNNING- BUT OF COURSE THAT'S PREDICATED ON A LOT OF THESE WRITERS THAT THERE'S THE- WORKFORCE SHORTAGE THAT WE'RE HOPING COMES TO AN END SOON BUT OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T KNOW- CERTAINLY WE'VE HAD UP ON FOR THINGS. UNFORESEEN HAPPEN WITH AND TO MAKE I OUR PERSPECTIVE OF THE POINT IS ASSUMING THAT THOSE THINGS PROGRESS IN A IN A POSITIVE DIRECTION. NONE BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE MOST OF THE AS- BETTER CAN HELP THEY NEED GUIDANCE FROM DVD WHAT HAVE YOU THAT THEY'D BE ABLE TO PROGRAMS THAT ARE IF NOT 1100% UP TO SPEED AT LEAST MAKING. IN THAT DIRECTION SO THAT WHEN WE GET THE- THREE. FOUR AS MY COLLEAGUE MS GRAHAM. TO WITH REGARD TO THE ALL. KICKING IN THAT WE- HAVE- ELLIE A UP AND DOWN ECOR. BE WORRY ABOUT YOU KNOW. PENALTIES NOT A PROBLEM WE WANT WE DON'T WANT. SO WORRIED ABOUT THE DISCONTENT- THAT IT PRECLUDES THEM FROM. ALL IN GOOD PROGRAMS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES SO WHAT WE BETTER I ANSWERED YOUR. WHAT ARE YOU AGREE WITH YOU THE OFFICE PENALTY WHAT WHAT I WANT AS A- PARENT AS I WANT. TO KNOW MORE MORE SERVICE MORE BRIDGEMAN MORE EDUCATION- I'M TRYING UNDER ENSURE. THAT THE MONEY'S SPENT PROPERLY. SO HOW YOU. JUDGE OF THAT WHAT YOU JUST SAID IS. WE HAVE. YEAR OLD DISTRICTS ALL OVER THE STATE ARE GONNA SPEND IT DIFFERENTLY- AND SO WE'LL SEE. BUT YOUR YOUR JOB IS TO DETERMINE THAT BUT MONEY IS ACTUALLY BEING SPENT PROPERLY. SO YOU DIDN'T GET ME- I WOULD ACTUALLY SAY THAT THAT. IF YOU COULD LET ME. BEFORE YOU INTERRUPT ME AND APPRECIATED. SO I GOT THIS QUESTION TWICE YOU HAVEN'T GIVEN ME ANY KIND OF BENCHMARK YOU GONNA SAY HEY. IT'S JUST GOOD PANDA WHEN THE AUDITS DONE IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR WE'RE GONNA SEE HOW IT IS. SO HOW ARE YOU GONNA BE DOING YOUR JOB IT OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS TO ENSURE THAT THIS MONEY. IS REACHING. THE KIDS AND THE FAMILIES WE ARE WE'RE ALL INTENDING TO HELP WHICH IS ALL WHICH IS WHAT WE ALL WANT. AND I DIDN'T GET GOT INTO ANY CLEAR INDICATION THAT YOU HAVE ANY IDEA OF HOW THAT WAS GOING TO BE HOW YOU'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO DO THAT. BUT THE JOINT EFFORT. RIGHT SO THE WORK THAT MR FONG. AND HIS FOLKS LIKE IF THAT DOING IT EITHER DOING THEIR BEST TO GET A- FOLKS IN THE FIELD BEST ADVICE THAT THEY CAN PERCENT OF STATUTE. RIGHT ALLOWABLE THERE IF. I PRESUME FROM CONVERSATION THAT ITALIAN COME FOR THEM. AND IS TALKING ABOUT USING THE FUNDS IN A WAY THAT YOU KNOW WOULDN'T BE ALLOWABLE WOULDN'T BE UP TO. THE EXPECTATION OF THE PROGRAM HERE SO WE'RE GOING TO LET THEM KNOW. RIGHT THAT THAT'S- NOT SOMETHING THEY SHOULD PROBABLY BE DOING. OR THEY WILL SUFFER SOME KIND OF AUDIT. AND IF YOU'RE OTHERWISE- THE WAY THAT THIS PROGRAM THOUGH AND SEVERAL PROGRAMS IN IN THAT CODE WORK- OFTEN IS THAT THE ACCOUNTABILITY IS AT THE YOU KNOW MORE OR LESS- AT THE BACK INTO THE AUDIT PROCESS RIGHT- IN FACT YOU THERE ISN'T NECESSARILY A WAY FOR FINANCE. TO GO IN AND- MONITOR EVERY ELEAZAR. SPENDING FOR THIS PROGRAM IN A REAL TIME BASIS THAT'S JUST NOT HOW IT WORKS- YOU KNOW IF THERE'S ADDITIONAL- ACCOUNTABILITY METRICS THAT NEED CERTAINLY NOT THE CONVERSATION I COULD BE HAPPY. IN THE SHORT TERM. BUT FOR US WE HEARD A LOT OF WE WANT TO BE RESPONSIVE TO WHAT ELEAZAR TELLING US OVER THIS WHOLE LAST YEAR. THAT THEY WERE HAVING A REALLY REALLY HARD I AM WORRIED ABOUT GETTING OVER PENALIZED- WHEN EVEN WHEN THEY-WERE MAKING A GOOD FAITH EFFORT- TO OFFER THE PROGRAM. SO AND FINANCES GOAL IS A TYPICALLY TO JUST BE YOU KNOW. CHECKING IN ON WHAT DISTRICTS ARE DOING ON THE MONEY ON A WEEKLY OR MONTHLY BASIS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT IT REALLY IS KIND OF MORE. HERE'S THE REQUIREMENT. AND THEN WE'RE GONNA HAVE A CONVERSATION AT A TIME CERTAIN CERTAIN STATUTE ABOUT HOW ABOUT. HOW THAT'S GOING. OKAY BROWN- MY DO THAT. I LEAST IN MY MIND I DON'T I DON'T WORK FOR THE L. A. ASE. I DON'T THINK YOU DO EITHER. OF WORK FOR THE FAMILY AND THE- OF THE STATE. THAT'S WE'RE SETTING UP FOR. AND WHAT WE SAW. DURING THE LAST TWO YEARS IS THAT THERE SEEM TO BE A DISCONNECT. BETWEEN L. A. A.'S. IN THOSE FAMILIES AND THOSE KIDS. AND THEN A TIME WHEN WE HAD A PANDEMIC AT A TIME WHEN MOST LEDS REFUSED TO OPEN THEIR SCHOOLS. WHEN THE PUBLIC HEALTH DOCTORS ALL SAID IT WAS SAFE TO DO SO- ELEAZAR. CONFIGURED TO DO. SO I WOULD. YOU KNOW JUST REMIND THE DEPARTMENT THAT. YOU DON'T WORK FOR THE A. S. AND IT SOUNDS LIKE WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS IT I DON'T AND I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND I TOTALLY RESPECT HIS JUDGMENT COMPLETED MISTER FOCUS SOUNDS LIKE YOUR DEFERRING. TO FUNG'S JUDGE AS TO WHETHER THE MONEY'S BEING SPENT APPROPRIATE OR NOT. THAT'S WHAT I HEARD. ARE YOU SAYING THAT IT'S A JOINT EFFORT MR FONG HAS A ROLE FINANCE OF THE ROLE IN THE AUDIT GUIDE PROCESS AS I MENTIONED HOW THE ROLE IN TERMS OF THE ACCOUNTABILITY OFF PROGRAM. ONE CRITICAL TO ME WHAT MR FUNK'S ROLLINS WITH A LOT OF ROLE AS I SEE DON'T. THE DEPARTMENT'S ROLE FINANCE. CERTAINLY THE- THE- COMPLIANCE AGENCY- BRITAIN'S OF THE STATUE FOR THIS PROGRAM. RIGHT CERTAINLY HAVE A HAND IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROGRAM RIGHT IT'S OUR PROPOSAL TO ADD THE NEW DOLLARS BUT TYPICALLY FOR A PROGRAM LIKE THIS. IT REALLY DOES FALL MORE WITHIN THE PURVIEW OF THE CD ALCOHOLIC I PROCESS THAT'S JUST KIND OF HOW A LOT OF EDUCATION PROGRAMS. WORK IN LESS IF FINANCES IT WOULD BE WRITTEN INTO OUR THE MONITORING PROCESS WHICH IS UP CRITIC TO ENSURE THAT THE- AND THE I LOOK AT FINANCES JOB TO DETERMINE. AND MAKE SURE THAT THE MONEY IS ACTUALLY GET INTO THEIR- TO THE KIDS AND I THINK IF. I REALLY HOPE THAT THE DEPARTMENT DOESN'T JUST TAKE. THE WORDS OF THE L. D. A.'S. THAT THINGS ARE WORKING OR NOT WORKING. THAT THEY- THEY REALLY HAVE A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF WHERE THE MONEY'S GOING WHETHER IT'S ACTUALLY GETTING TO ATTEND A PURPOSE. SO- I'D LIKE TO. GO TO GO TO MISS WORLD FOR THE MONTEREY COUNTY. IF SHE IS STILL THERE I AM STILL HERE IT'S WONDERFUL THANK YOU SO LONG. ANY OFFICER BENT THANK YOU- IF YOU COULD YOUR WITH WITH THIS NEW APPROPRIATION- I'D LOVE TO HEAR SORT OF HOW YOU'RE COUNTIES PLANNING ON SPENDING AND WHERE OR WHERE IT'S GONNA GO. I KNOW THE ROUTE THE EVERY EVERY LEN IS FACING ENORMOUS CHALLENGES BUT JUST WANT TO UNDERSTAND FROM YOUR SPECIFIC AT THIS POINT WHERE. YOU INTEND TO. SPEND THE MONEY. THANK YOU AND- I JUST HAVE TO SAY OFF THE BAT THAT MY ROLE IS NOT AS A DIRECT SERVICE PROVIDER- I USED TO PROVIDE DIRECT SERVICE TO STUDENTS- I AM NOW AND- THE CAPACITY TO PROVIDE SUPPORT THAT CRITICAL SUPPORT TO OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS- AND OUR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. ANDOTHER PARTNERS WHO ARE ACTUALLY ADMINISTERING THE PROGRAM SO. I DON'T HAVE ANY AUTHORITY OVER AND THE ACTUAL SPENDING OF THE FUNDS BUT WHAT I DO PER MONTH AS PART OF THAT SYSTEM. IS GUIDONS- COACHING I RESOURCE BROKERING I'M I'M SORT-OF THE BOOTS ON THE GROUND TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION ABOUT WHO CHECKS TO MAKE SURE THAT- A THERE IS A PROGRAM RUNNING AND THAT IT IS A QUALITY PROGRAM- PART OF MY DUTY AS- IN MY CAPACITY IS TO GO OUT. TO DO SITE VISITS TO ENSURE THAT OUR STUDENTS AND FAMILIES ARE BEING SERVED BY THESE PROGRAMS AND- AND IF NEEDED PROVIDE SOME. IMPORTANT SUPPORT AND TO ENSURE THAT THEIR QUALITY AND BASED ON THE CALIFORNIA QUALITY STANDARDS FOR EXPANDED LEARNING- DETERMINES THE NEEDS AND ADDRESS THOSE NEEDS ACCORDINGLY. SO THAT'S MY ROLE I AM I HOPE THAT ANSWERS THE QUESTION- BUT I CAN I CAN DEFINITELY TELL YOU THAT THERE IS VARIANCE- AND WHAT I'M HEARING TO OUT THERE YOU PROBABLY HAVE ALL HEARD THE TERM PLANS THAT MAKE I THINK A LOT OF OUR DISTRICTS ARE FEELING. THAT THEY HAVE A PLAN FOR EVERYTHING- AND I WILL TELL YOU FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THAT THAT IS FRUSTRATING- BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE IT JUST ENCOURAGES. THE SIDELOAD NATION. OF AT. AND YET I DON'T THINK THAT IT'S THE INTENT AT ALL I THINK. WE HAVE AN ENORMOUS OPPORTUNITY TO PARADE FUNDING AS- MICHAEL FUNK MENTIONED EARLIER. DO YOU REALLY MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES- LOOK AT IT AS ONE UNIVERSAL PROGRAM. AND NOT AS- SEPARATES AND SILO TO PROGRAMS AND I WANT TO SPEAK- TO THAT POINT THAT I HEAR A LOT THAT. IT AFTER SCHOOL IS A COMPONENT IT'S AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF A CHILD'S EDUCATION. WE'RE NOT MEANT TO BE THAT CHILD'S FIRST TEACHER BUT WE ARE THERE TO BE ABLE TO SUPPLEMENT AND TO PROVIDE THAT ENRICHMENT THAT REALLY ENHANCES THE EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE. SO HOW DO WE BREED ALL OF THESE VARIOUS FUNDING SOURCES TOGETHER TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE MEETING- I'M THE GREATEST NUMBER OF STUDENTS POSSIBLE YOU KNOW GETTING TO THE CHAIR MEMBERS COMMENT ABOUT A UNIVERSAL SERVICE I HAVE THREE KIDS MYSELF. I KNOW THAT I HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY GRATEFUL FOR THE UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE PROGRAM FOR EXAMPLE AND THAT IS TO HELP MY MIDDLE CLASS FAMILY TREMENDOUSLY THAT'S AN EXAMPLE- OF A SERVICE THAT IS SUPPORTING- MIDDLE CLASS. WE HAVE A GROWING BODY AS STUDENTS AND FAMILIES WHO NEED. THE SERVICE SAYS AND THIS BREEDING TOGETHER OF FUNDING IS GOING TO ALLOW US TO SERVE EVEN MORESTUDENTS AND I THINK THAT IS OF CRITICAL CRITICAL IMPORTANCE. AND I GUESS BIG BASED ON YOUR VANTAGE POINT WHERE WOULD YOU YOU MENTIONED THE AS DIFFERENT CAPACITY ISSUES DIFFERENT. DIFFERENT PROGRAMS HAVE DIFFERENT ISSUES WHERE DO YOU. WHAT WHAT'S YOUR BEST GUESS OF WHERE. THE MONEY'S GOING TO BE SPENT- I THINK FOR THOSE WHOHAVE CURRENT ASUS IN TWENTY FIRST CENTURY FUNDED PROGRAMS THEY ARE GOING TO LOOK AT THEIR ELO P. DOLLARS AND- BE VERY GRATEFUL THAT THEY CAN PROVIDE FULL TIME OPPORTUNITY TO THEIR STAFF. THEY INCLUDES BY THE WAY TO THOSE WHO- I THEIR ENTITIES THAT HAVE BEEN MENTIONED- WE DON'T NEED TO- AS YOU NO IT'S WHETHER IT'S THE STARBUCKS OR AMAZON ALL SHARE STORY DIRECTED JUST HAPPENED A COUPLE MONTHS AGO- IN MY WORLD AND WE OPERATE EAST TEAM HAVE BEEN ISSUED IT FOR WE PROVIDE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AROUND STEAM THIS YEAR'S FOCUSES ON IN QUERY- HAD A PEER MENTOR WHO IS A- VERY SEASONED STAFF PERSON- AND QUITE UNNATURAL AND BEING A LEADER. AND SOMEBODY THAT I WANTED TO BUILD THE CAPACITY OF- TO SEE HIM GROW WITHIN THE FIELD. AND HE SAID TO ME TOMORROW I AM SORRY I CANNOT. DO THIS BECAUSE I. HI TO FIND A MORE LIQUOR POSITION AT THIS POINT IN TIME I HOPE TO COME BACK TO EXPAND ATTORNEY BECAUSE THIS IS WHERE MY HEART IS. I LOVE THIS WORK I'M VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT IT BUT I NEED I NEED A LITTLE BIT MORE TO BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN MYSELF AT THIS POINT IN TIME. SO I DO SEE THAT THOSE WHO HAVE EXISTING ASUS TWENTY FIRST CENTURY FUNDING. WILL USE SOME OF THOSE DOLLARS TO SUPPLEMENT TO PROVIDE- I THINK A PACKAGE FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD- WHETHER IT'S ADDITIONAL STIPENDS WHETHER IT'S A FULL TIME OPPORTUNITY. TO REALLY RETAIN THOSE STAFF AND RETAIN THEM YEAR ROUND- BECAUSE REMEMBER THOSE WHO WILL BE FOR TWENTY FIRST CENTURY FUNDING. WAS THE ONLY SOURCE OF WE HAD FOR SUMMER PROGRAMMING. AND NOT ALL DISTRICTS EVERYWHERE HAD SUMMER PROGRAMMING AND STILL BE EXPANDED LEARNING OPPORTUNITY. FINING HIM ABOUT. AND WHAT THAT MEANT AT LEAST IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY IS WE WERE HAVING TO HAVE- SOME OF OUR AGENCIES WHO WERE RUNNING SUMMER PROGRAM. THEY WERE ACTUALLY AT TAKING FUNDING FROM ANOTHER ENTITY YOU BY THE BOYS AND GIRLS CLUB FOR EXAMPLE THEY MAY HAVE SOME REALLY PHENOMENAL STAFF PEOPLE THEY DIDN'T WANT TO LOSE AND THERE WAS THIS- SORT OF RECIPROCAL WORK. OUR RELATIONSHIP THAT EXISTED THEN WITH THE YMCA BECAUSE THEY NEEDED A LOT OF STUFF AND THAT WAS A WAY WE WERE ABLE CREATIVE WAY WE ARE ABLE TO RETAIN. GOOD STAFF YEAR ROUND AND YELLOW HE OFFERS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR MORE YEAR ROUND- YOUR MAPS YOUR ROUND JOB OPPORTUNITIES FOR SOME OF OUR OUR MOST HIGHLY QUALIFIED STAFF WE WANT TO KEEP THEM IN THE FIELD AND I KNOW MICHAEL HAD MENTIONED- PATHWAYS WHICH IS ANOTHER TOPIC I'M EXTREMELY PASSIONATE ABOUT- AND CONTINUING TO TRY TO DO SOME WORK. IN THAT AREA AS WELL AS- THERE'S A SHORT TERM SOLUTION AND THEN THERE'S ALSO THE LONG TERM SOLUTION. YEAH COULDN'T I COULDN'T AGREE MORE OBVIOUS OBVIOUSLY THAT- OF THIS THE WAGES THAT WERE PAYING- MOST OF THESE EMPLOYEES THEY'RE NOT SUSTAINABLE LONG TERM- LIES YOU MENTIONED THIS DIFFICULTY IT'S DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO SEE- A CAREER TRAJECTORY IN THESE IN THESE FIELDS RATHER THAN. JUST AS A JOB TO YOU KNOW GO JUMP INTO ANOTHER FIELD- IT'S I THINK THAT DEFINITELY IS THE RIGHT STRATEGY AND OBVIOUSLY I FULLY SUPPORT- LOOKING AT WAYS TO INCREASE COMPETITION I THINK THAT'S QUITE. OFTEN THE CHAIR HAVE FOUGHT FOR YEARS TO INCREASE RATES- BECAUSE WE KNEW THAT FOR SO LONG PEOPLE WERE JUST UNDERPAID AND IT'S JUST NOT SUSTAINABLE TO KIND OF TURN YOU HAVE THE TURN OVER YOU HAVE- WITH A FEW PEOPLE. OBVIOUSLY PEOPLE LIKE BABYSITTERS AFTER TOGETHER YOU CAN BET YOU GET BABYSITTERS BUT IF YOU IF YOU WANT TO ACCESS YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO- HAVE. EDUCATORS YOUNG PEOPLE EDUCATE TO CAN'T PAY PEOPLE LIKE EXPECT THEM TO BE EDUCATORS THAT'S NOT. A FAIR- IS NOT A FAIR PROPOSAL IT IS NOT FAIR EXPECTATIONS SO TOTALLY. I TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU THERE IS SO SOUNDS LIKE ONE ONE POTENTIAL THAT YOU SEE IS- PERHAPS- YOU KNOW OLD WHILE SERVICE PROVIDE YOU A SERVICE PROVIDERS THAT ARE ALREADY GETTING- ASUS IN TWENTY FIRST CENTURY- MANUFACT- FIGURE OUT HOW TO. TAKE SOME OF THE NEW FUNDING TO INVEST IN OUR CURRENT EMPLOYEES. WHETHER IT'S AN INCREASE COMPENSATION OR REALLY TRYING TO DO TRAINING AND REALLY TRYING TO- INSURER ENHANCE- THEIR COMPETENCY AND THEIR SKILL AND REALLY HELP BUILDING- BUILDING THEM UP. I'M ONE ISSUE WE HEAR LOT ABOUT IS A REALLY AROUND LEARNING LOSS AS WELL AS MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES- OBVIOUSLY. YOU HAVE NEITHER. SOCIAL WORKERS OR- PSYCHOLOGIST ON STAFF YOUR GIVE YOU CAN GIVE US A SENSE OF IN YOUR COUNTY HOW. THOSE SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE. HELPING TACKLE THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE- IN IN THEIR PROGRAMS FOR THOSE ISSUES. YEAH AND THAT'S AN EXCELLENT QUESTION I THINK THAT- WHAT WE FOUND WITH OUR PROGRAMS WERE REPORTING WITH THE INCREASED FLEXIBILITY THAT THEY RECEIVED- EARLY LAST YEAR. ME THEY FELT VERY FORTUNATE THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO USE THOSE FUNDING THAT THE EXISTING ASUS IN TWENTY FIRST CENTURY FUNDING DURING THE DAY TO ALLOW THEIR AFTER SCHOOL STAFF TO ACTUALLY WORK DURING THE DAY TO SUPPORT OUR YOUTH AND FAMILIES WE SOUGHT THE FUNDING BEING USED THAT WAY. AND HAVING QUITE DRAMATIC- POSITIVE RESULTS MATTER OF FACT- KIDS YOU WERE NOT NECESSARILY SHOWING UP FOR THEIR DISTANCE LEARNING CLASSES- BLUES AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM STAFF WOULD PLAY THAT ROLE OF CALLING HOME AND FINDING OUT WHERE THAT CHILD WAS- I WOULD SAY- FROM MY EXPERIENCE ALSO WORKING IN THE FIELD. WE ARE VERY LUCKY AS AFTER SCHOOL WORKERS TO HAVE DEVELOPED VERY DEEP RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR STUDENTS AND FAMILIES AND I THINK THAT'S PARTLY HAS TO DO WITH THE FACT. THAT OUR PARENTS COME TO PICK UP THEIR CHILDREN THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONVERSE THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD THOSE RELATIONSHIPS AFTER SCHOOL IN A WAY THAT- YOU KNOW NOT OFTEN AS POSSIBLE IN THE CLASSROOM- AND SO DOES AFTER SCHOOL WORKERS PLAYED SUCH A VITAL ROLE IN MAKING SURE THAT OUR STUDENTS WERE RE ENGAGING IN SCHOOL DURING THAT. REALLY AT A TIME OF GREAT DROP OFF. AND I THINK ALSO HELPING TO BUILD THE SKILLS- YOU KNOW I SORT OF WALKED AWAY FROM THE TERM LEARNING RECOVERY BECAUSE I THINK WE LEARNED SO. SO MANY NEW SKILLS AND EVEN MY OWN DAUGHTER ANNE AND SONS. LEARNING HOW TO. IT INTERFACE A THE IT DID. SPACE WAS A NEW SKILL THAT THEY ALL LEARNED AND SO WAIT HERE I AM MAYBE WORKING AT HOME AND HAVE MY TEN YEAR OLD SAY YOU KNOW I'M NOT. INTERCONNECT MY CONNECTIVITY IS DOWN AND THEN HAVING- HER FIGURE IT OUT ON HER OWN- WE SAW A LOT OF THESE SKILLS AND A LOT OF- AND A LOT OF OUR FAMILIES AND OUR STUDENTS TO. DALY BECAME VERY SELF RELIANT DURING THE PANDEMIC AND SO. I SAY ALL THAT BECAUSE I THINK. WE REALLY ALSO NEED TO LOOK AT WHAT WE'VE LEARNED FROM THE PANDEMIC AND NOT BE PULLED BACK INTO WHAT WE ARE DEFINING AS NORMAL- AND IN PERSON IN FACT I'VE HAD SOME DISTRICTS ASKED ME. IS IT POSSIBLE FOR US TO DO ANYTHING ONLINE. IS WE'VE ACTUALLY HAVE SOME KIDS WHO EXCELLED- DURING ONLINE AND- YEAH OF COURSE IT HAD TO ANSWERING STATE. UNFORTUNATELY AT THIS POINT NO- BUT BECAUSE WE'RE ENCOURAGING IN PERSON AND WE KNOW COURSE KNOW THE VALUE OF THAT. BUT THERE ARE ALSO SOME STUDENTS WHO WHO QUITE. LITERALLY BENEFIT FROM A NOT AN OPPORTUNITY- AND AGAIN YOU KNOW. THE MARLBOROUGH WINES AND THAT MAY BE A RESOURCE THAT THEY NEED TO TAP INTO. AT SOME POINT TO MAKE IT WORK. SO GREAT YOU ARE. J. YOUR COMMENTS ARE JUST GONNA JUMP MISTER MISTER FALK. IT JUST ASKING IF YOU IF YOU COULD EXPAND ON HIS VISION AROUND THE EXTENSION OF THE SCHOOL DAY WHICH I THINK IS REALLY THERE THOUGH THE WAY THAT PARENTS TO SEE I DON'T THINK THE PARENTS SEE SORT OF SCHOOL AFTER SCHOOL AND THIS SORT OF A COMPLETELY SEPARATE THING THIS IS JUST ONE ONE DAY BEFORE THEIR CHILDREN NOT PERHAPS THE SAME SITE. SO ON THE CLUSTER FROM COULD JUST KIND OF EXPAND ON HOWHOW WE COULD REACH THAT- MORE INTEGRATED COHESIVE- SINGLE EDUCATION TO. THANK YOU MISTER TAKE IT ALSO THANK YOU FOR REMEMBERING THE- LOOK DECADES WE WORK TOGETHER ON THE WEST SIDE OF. SAN FRANCISCO SUPPORTING COMMUNITY SCHOOL FAMILIES WEARING DIFFERENT HATS- I'M THANKFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADD SOME ADDITIONAL COMMENTS NOT ONLY TO YOUR QUESTION BUT TO SOME OTHER COMMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE. AFTER EVERY DISTRICT THAT IS. IN FACT IT IT'S ACTUALLY A FEW DISTRICTS COMPARED YOU ARE SAYING I DON'T WANT T USE THIS MONEY IT'S TOO MUCH I CAN'T HANDLE THIS IT'S- THERE ARE DISTRICTS ALL ACROSS THE STATE SMALL BARGE. WHO ARE SEEKING THIS INVESTMENT. AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO REINVENT EDUCATION. AND TO TRANSFORM EDUCATION. LET'S FACE IT EXTENDING THE SCHOOL DAY. ISN'T GOING TO WORK FOR SOME STUDENTS AND FAMILIES WHERE THE SCHOOL DAY AS A WORK FOR THEM. I'M WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION I'M SUPPORTER OF K. TWELVE EDUCATION I'M SUPPORTER OF K. TWELVE EDUCATORS MY DAUGHTERS IN A PUBLIC SCHOOL HERE IN SACRAMENTO THAT WORK WITH HER. BUT THE MAGIC HAPPENS IN TRANSFORMATION DISCONNECTED FROM THE COMMUNITY THE SUNSET NEIGHBORHOOD BEAON CENTER IN SAN FRANCISCO WHERE SCHOOLS FUNCTION BEST. WHEN THE COMMUNITY AND THE SCHOOL IS WORKING TOGETHER AND THAT'S NOT ONLY TO COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT CAN BENEFIT FROM THIS BUT ALSO OTHER INSTITUTIONS. SO WE HAVE. SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN WE ESTABLISHED. FOR A QUALITY STANDARDS FOR EXPANDED LEARNING IN CALIFORNIA FOR AFTER SCHOOL. AND THERE'S A REQUIREMENT IN STASHING. IN EVERY CASE IS A TWENTY FIRST CENTURY PROGRAM. SELECT WORK WITH THE QUALITY STANDARDS AND. DEVELOP CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT AWESOMEST SO THE HEAT THE YOUTH AND STUDENTS IN THOSE PROGRAMS ARE EXPERIENCING. SOMETHING VERY TRANSFORMATIVE AND IN RICHMOND- AND THE RELATIONSHIPS THAT MAR MENTIONED WHERE OUR COMMUNITY EDUCATORS HAVE CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE STUDENTS AND FAMILIES SO THE QUALITY STANDARDS FOR EXPAND LEARNING. WE'RE ALSO BUILT INTO THE PROGRAM PLAN. THAT IS REQUIRED FOR THE EXPANDED LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES PROGRAM SO THERE'S A LINE THAT THERE. AND I WOULD I WOULD SAY WITH CONFIDENCE. THAT YES QUALITY VARIES ACROSS AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS. RIGHT UP I HAVE TEAMS OF PEOPLE ALL ACROSS THE STATE AND I HAVE BEEN ALL ACROSS THE STATE INS IN REMOTE AREAS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND IN THE DEEPEST URBAN AREAS. AND I SEE. HIGH QUALITY PROGRAMS CONSISTENTLY WHERE CHILDREN ARE ENGAGED THERE. EXPANDING THEIR HORIZONS IT MISTER KING YOU MENTIONED MENTAL HEALTH. ISSUES AND SOCIAL EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOREMOST IS THAT THE RELATIONSHIPS THAT AFTER SCHOOL STAFF HAVE WITH THEIR CHILDREN. OUR DEEP AND CARING AND THAT IS ONE OF THE STRONGEST PROTECTIVE FACTORS AGAINST MENTAL HEALTH AND SOCIAL EMOTIONAL CHALLENGES. IS WHEN STUDENTS FEEL ISOLATED AND OUT OF RELATIONSHIPS WITH STUDENTS. THAT IS THE MOST THE STRONGEST PROTECTIVE FACTOR AGAINST MENTAL HEALTH AND SOCIAL EMOTIONAL CHALLENGES. SO MR TANG IT'S THAT EXPANDED LEARNING IS NOT OF THAT ON IT'S NOT IT'S NOT THE BABYSITTING IT'S NOT JUST A PLACE TO KEEP KIDS SAFE IT'S WERE CHILDREN AND YOUTHS AND ADULTS IN FACT CAN. EXPERIENCE AND EXPAND WHATEVER'S HAPPENING DURING THE SCHOOL DAY. AND PARENTS CAN RELY ON THIS AS NOT ONLY A PLACE WHERE THEIR CHILD CAN BE SAFE BUT A PLACE WHERE THEIR CHILD CAN EXPERIENCE. THINGS THEY WOULDN'T HAVE EXPERIENCED OTHERWISE LET'S FACE IT THERE'S A LOT OF. THERE'S A LOT OF MIDDLE UPPER CLASS FAMILIES WHO PROVIDE WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEIR CHILDREN. A LOT OF LOW INCOME FAMILIES. ARE NOT ABLE TO DO THAT. BUT IN OUR AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS ARE INTENTIONAL ABOUT PROVIDING THE KIND OF EXPERIENCES. THAT ENHANCE THE SUPPORT THE SCHOOL DAY AND ARE. GIVING THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE WHAT'S POSSIBLE THEIR LIVES THEN THAT'S THE VISION IS. A PLACE FOR THESE CHILDREN TO HAVE LEARNING THAT IS ACTIVE LEARNING THAT IS. SUPPORTED BY CARRIED ADULTS LEARNING THAT EXPANDS THEIR HORIZONS LEARNING THAT HAS MANY LEARNING THAT HELPS THEM CONNECT TO WHAT'S RELEVANT TO THEM SO THE ACADEMICS THAT THEY MIGHT RECEIVE DURING THE SCHOOL DAY HAVE A PLACE TO BE APPLIED I CAN I CAN YOU KNOW I COULD GO ON FOR A LONG TIME. NO IT'S SO IT'S SO THEN JUST TO STIR UP FOR IN A SORT OF FINAL FOLLOW UP YOU KNOW TURNBACK OF THE CHURCH. BUT SO IT INTO OF THE VANISHED- OF ALL THE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS SAYING OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVE URBAN YOU'VE RIDER PER. WITHOUT LIKE SOME OF THE MONEY COULD BE GOING TO TRAINING SOME OF THE MONEY COULD BE GOING TO SALARIES- WHERE ELSE I MEAN THE MONEY CAN BE. GOING TO HIRING BRING ON GREAT CAPACITY WELL DO YOU SEE THE RE A TO KIND OF LOOK TALK ABOUT THE VISION OF THE SIX THAT OF THE- SCHOOL DAY DISCO. OF THEM THAT YOU KNOW WE ALWAYS GET A- BY CONSTITUENTS THAT'S- IN A WAY. THEY ALWAYS CAN ASK. HAD MICRO. ARE US WHAT SCRIPTURE SCRATCH THEIR HEAD AND SAY HEY WE ALL THIS YOU KNOW THE THIS IS HUGE. OF YOU KNOW- TO PAY. SEVEN BILLION. A CERTAIN A LOT OF MONEY SO WE'RE IS THAT. WARS ARE GOING. IS SO IT CAN YOU GIVE US A- OF SORT OF FROM YOUR- VANTAGE POINT WHERE. WHERE THE- WHERE THE CBO'S ARE GOING TO BE SOME ON THAT. WE'RE WORKING. WITH A LOT OF US. AND BY THE WAY THERE ARE WHO ARE. DOING SOME PARTNERING WITH COMMITTEE SERVICE BUT THERE ARE TWO. WHO ARE AS- RESOURCE AS- WAIT SUPPORT SCHOOL DISTRICT STAFF IS GREAT A FULL TIME AND ENGAGE THEM AND AFTER SCHOOLS WELL WHICH IS A WIN WIN FOR KIDS RIGHT- AND SO WE HAVE WE HAVE DISTRICTS THAT ARE SAYING WE'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO BRING IN. A SHE CLUBBER WE'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO BRING IN- SOMETHING WITH- THEATER ARTS OR WE'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO BRING IN. SOMETHING FOR COMPUTER CODING OR VIDEO PRODUCTION AND WHEN DONE WELL THOSE THOSE ACTIVITIES THOSE INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES ARE. CONNECTING WITH THE ACADEMICS THE KIDS ARE LEARNING DURING THE SCHOOL DAY SO. THAT WHEN THEY ARE WORKING WITH VIDEO PRODUCTION THEATER THERE'S SCRIPT WRITING THERE'S STORYTELLING IT'S CONNECTED TO LITERACY IT'S APPLYING THE ACADEMIC CENTER DURING THE SCHOOL DAY AND THERE ARE DISTRICTS THAT ARE TALKING ABOUT WE CAN NOW. PARTNER WITH THIS THEATER COMPANY IN TOWN TO COME IN AND WE GOT THE COR STAFF TO SUPPORT THE KIDS AND NOW WE'VE GOT THESE. THE THEATER COMPANY OR THE TECHNOLOGY COMPANY. OR THE SCIENCE MUSEUM. TO COME IN AND BRING OPPORTUNITIES TO THE CHILDREN THEY WOULDN'T HAVE HAD BEFORE FOR SOME- DISTRICTS THEY'VE ONLY BEEN ABLE TO JUST PAY THE MINIMUM WAGE FOR STAFF WITH ACES IN TWENTY FIRST CENTURY THEY HAVEN'T HAD THE MONEY. TO INVEST IN ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT FOR THE CHILDREN TO USE TO EXPLORE THESE OPPORTUNITIES SOFT ARE THINKING ABOUT- INVESTING IN CERTAIN TYPES OF EQUIPMENT TO ALLOW THESE DIFFERENT ENRICHMENT TYPES OF ACTIVITIES. AND OF COURSE NOT TO MENTION. THE MONEY TO GO PLACES LIKE LESS TAKE THE KIDS. YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT. WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT MR TANG IS WORD LITERALLY FIVE SIX BLOCKS FROM OCEAN BEACH. WHERE WE WOULD TAKE- THE STUDENTS. TO THE BEACH FOR SOME KIND OF ENVIRONMENTAL AWARENESS LESSON OR  BEACH CLEAN UP. WE WOULD HAVE AT LEAST HALF THE KIDS FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD WHO SAID THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THEY'VE GONE TO THE BEACH. SO TO ASSUME THAT OUR CHILDREN GET TO GO PLACES AND EXPERIENCE THINGS THIS IS WHERE A LOT OF THAT MONEY CAN GO SO. BUT FIRST AND FOREMOST I WOULD SAY QUALITY STAFF PAINS STAFF YOU SAID IT IF WE PAY MINIMUM WAGE WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE THE TYPE OF IT A STAFF THAT STICK AROUND. IT CAN REALLY CONTRIBUTE TO THE EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES INTO THE DEVELOPMENT AND SUPPORT THESE CHILDREN NEED. FIRST AND FOREMOST SUPPORTING STAFF IN THE WORLD GETTING THEM CONNECTED CONNECTING STAFF IN THE SCHOOL DATE TO THE AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM YOU KNOW THE HIGHEST QUALITY SOME PROGRAMS. FROM THE SUMMER MATTERS CAMPAIGN WE'RE NOT PROGRAMS THAT COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS RAN THEY WERE PROGRAMS WHERE. TEACHERS AND STAFF FROM THE SCHOOL THEY WORK ALONGSIDE OF COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS STAFF. TO REALLY WORK TOGETHER TO SUPPORT. CHILDREN HOLISTICALLY THROUGHOUT THE DAY. REALLY THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTIONS AND OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A- KEY ISSUE NOT JUST FOR CALIFORNIA AND EDUCATION BUT FOR CALIFORNIA THIS PRESS. THANK YOU SO MUCH EIGHT. WHAT I THINK ONE OF THE LAST COMMENT YOU MADE I THINK IS PROBABLY THE ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT IS THE LIVABLE WAGES FOR OUR WORKERS WERE EXPECTING THEM TO DO SOMETHING THAT IS SO IMPORTANT AND THAT IS TEACHING OUR CHILDREN WORKING WITH OUR CHILDREN- HELPING WITH THEIR MENTAL HEALTH AND IF WE DON'T. PAY THEM WHAT. AND WE DON'T PAY EVERYBODY EVERYBODY WITH THEIR WORTH WHEN I GET IT BUT IF WE DON'T PROVIDE. LIVABLE WAGES AND BENEFITS WE WON'T HAVE THE STABILITY THAT WE NEED FOR THESE PROGRAMS. SO I WANT TO JOIN WITH MY COLLEAGUES WHO WHO FEEL THAT THIS I SOMETHING THAT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. I THINK MAKING SURE THAT THEY THE PROGRAMS ARE NOT BABY SITTING AND I THINK IT'S CLEAR FROM WE'VE SEEN QUALITY PROGRAMS IN IN MY DISTRICT AND COLTON. I LOVE GOING TO THEIR AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS AND THE PRODUCTION SAY PUT ON. MANY OF THE CHILDREN CAN'T TRAVEL OUT OF THE COUNTRY BUT THEY GET TO DO PRODUCTIONS WHERE THEY'RE LOOKING AT OTHER COUNTRIES. ARE THEY ALSO GET HELP WITH HOMEWORK THESE ARE THE SORTS OF THINGS THAT PROVIDE THAT EXTENSION- THE MENTAL HEALTH THAT WAS COMMENTED ON BY ABOUT AN EXTENSION. WE IT'S AN EXPERT EXPANDED LEARNING OPPORTUNITY BUT- IT'S AN EXTENSION OF THE SCHOOL. THE SCHOOL DAY SO THAT THE CHILDREN THEN HAVE MORE PROVIDED TO THEM DURING THIS PERIOD OF TIME. AND THAT IT IT'S INVALUABLE EVERY PROGRAM THAT I HAVE SEEN HAS IT IN MY OPINION HAS PROVEN TO BE A VERY- SUCCESSFUL ON THE EVE OF SUBSTANCE PROVED TO BE VERY SUCCESSFUL. THE LAST THING THAT IS. AGAIN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. I WOULD. SUGGEST THAT. EIGHT IS MY NUMBER I'M NOT SAYING YOUR DEFENSIVE BUT I WOULD SUGGEST THAT INSTEAD OF HAVING. THE IT IS IT'S WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT WE DO HAVE THE ACCOUNTABILITY SO IF WE DO HAVE THE QUALITY STANDARDS THAT WERE DISCUSSED EARLIER ON EXTENDED LEARNING EXPANDED LEARNING THEN ONCE WE HAVE THOSE STANDARDS AND WE KNOW WHAT IT IS WE EXPECT FOR ME TO THE SCHOOLS BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT SOME SCHOOLS REQUIRE MORE ASSISTANCE. THEY MAY NOT BE AS CREATIVE BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO PAY THE PEOPLE TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES TO THE TO THE TO THE STUDENTS WE NEED TO PAY SO THAT WE CAN WE CAN ATTRACT THE VERY PEOPLE WE WANT AND THAT OUR CHILDREN DESERVE AND- IT. GO BACK TO HE SAME THING THAT THE LIVABLE WAGES. WITH BENEFITS AND DISPATCHER MCCARTY YOU TALKED ABOUT- PROVIDING THOSE HOURS FOR THE FOR THE FOR THE MOST FOR THOSE. WORKERS SO THEY CAN USE THOSE TOWARDS TEACHING OR TOWARDS THE- WITH SOMETHING RELATED TO TEACHING A RELATED TO. SOMETHING FURTHER THAN JUST. AN AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM I THINK THE- WHAT WE'RE PROVIDING HERE IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT IN SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS IT BECOMES. CRITICAL NOT JUST SOMETHING THAT IS FUN IT IS CRITICAL FOR SOME OF THOSE SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND FOR SOME OF THOSE STUDENTS AND I APPLAUD THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS BEING OFFERED BUT THE ACCOUNTABILITY MUST BE SOMETHING THAT WE LOOK AT. SO THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SAY A FEW WORDS MISTER CHAIRMAN. OKAY THANK YOU BEFORE- AND- UGANDA YET YOUR- THIS COULD TAKE ROLE HAVE REQUIREMENTS. MCCARTY HERE GALLAGHER. PLEASE MEDINA WHAT DONALD REYES HERE THANK GODDESS. OKAY THANK YOU FOR A SEVEN HERE BUT WE'LL HOLD THIS ISSUE OFTEN IF THE COURSES A HOT TOPIC I NEXT LET'S GO TO ISSUE NUMBER TWO SCHOOL NUTRITION AND MEAL INFRASTRUCTURE WE HAVE DIFFERENT FINANCE ALEJO AND DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. GOOD MORNING THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS ALLEN CHAU DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- IT IS THE PRIORITY OF THE ADMINISTRATION TO ADDRESS ISSUES AND FOOD AND NUTRITION SECURITY. ENCOURAGE HEALTHY DIETS AND ESTABLISHED A CLIMATE SMART SCHOOL FOOD SUPPLY. THE PROPOSALS AND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET BUILD OFF OF THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET INVESTMENTS- A COMMITMENT TO IMPLEMENT UNIVERSAL MALES. SPECIFICALLY THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROVIDES FIVE HUNDRED NINETY SIX MILLION ONGOING PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND. TO IMPLEMENT BE UNIVERSAL SCHOOL MEALS PROGRAM THAT WAS INCLUDED IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT. THIS IS IN ADDITION TO FIFTY FOUR MILLION DOLLAR- PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND PROVIDED IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE. BUT ACT FOR A TOTAL ADDITIONAL AND YOU'LL UNIVERSAL MEALS INVESTMENTS OF SIX HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS- SO THIS AMOUNT IS BASED ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE FEDERAL WAIVERS THAT CURRENTLY REIMBURSE ALL MEALS AT THE FEDERAL THREE RATE- WILL AND AT THE END OF JUNE TWENTY TWENTY TWO- AND AMOUNTS TO A TOTAL STATE INVESTMENTS. OF ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE STATE PROGRAM- THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO INCLUDES COMPLIMENTARY INVESTMENTS TO THE ROLL OUT OF UNIVERSAL MALES- THIS INCLUDES FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION. ONETIME PROPOSITION NINETY GENERAL FUND- TO PROVIDE SCHOOL KITCHEN INFRASTRUCTURE GRANTS. TO INCREASE LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES CAPACITY TO PROVIDE FRESH AND NUTRITIOUS SCHOOL MEALS. IN ANTIGEN ANTICIPATION- OF UNIVERSAL MEALS IMPLEMENTATION. ALLOWABLE USES UNDER THIS PROGRAM INCLUDE PURCHASE OF COOKING EQUIPMENT SERVICE APPOINTMENT REFRIGERATION AND STORAGE TRANSPORTATION AND- FACILITY UPGRADES AND TRAINING FOR FOOD SERVICE STAFF- THE BUDGET ALSO PROPOSES AN ADDITIONAL THREE MILLION- PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND. FOR THE SCHOOL BREAKFAST AND SUMMER MEALS PROGRAM START UP GRANTS PROGRAM- FOR A BUDGET YOUR TOTAL OF FOUR POINT ZERO ONE SEVEN MILLION. THESE FUNDS- ARE TENDED TO ALSO REIMBURSE ELIGIBLE COSTS INCURRED IN THE CURRENT YEAR- TO ENCOURAGE SCHOOLS TO IMPLEMENT AND EXPAND BREAKFAST PROGRAMS IN PREPARATION FOR UNIVERSAL MUNIS- THAT. USE MY COMMENTS AND HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. OKAY THANK YOU L. L. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS ANYWAY WHAT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE THIS MRNING WE WANTED TO SHARE OUR ASSESSMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS ON TWO OF THE GOVERNOR'S SCHOOL NUTRITION PROPOSALS SPECIFICALLY THE FIVE HUNDRED AND NINETY SIX MILLION AUGMENTATION FOR SCHOOL MEALS ANSWER THE FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR ONE TIME FUNDING FOR ADDITIONAL KITCHEN INFRASTRUCTURE AND TRAINING GRANTS. BURST ON AUGMENTATION WE'VE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED THE PROPOSED AUGMENTATION THIS PROPOSAL IS ALIGNED WITH TRAILER LEGISLATION FROM THE BACK BUDGET PASSED LAST YEAR REQUIRING THAT BEGINNING IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE ALL CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS PROVIDE ONE- FREE BREAKFAST AND ONE FREE LUNCH PER SCHOOL DAY TO ANY STUDENT REQUESTING A MEAL UNDER UNIVERSAL MEALS. THE REMAINDER OF MY COMMENTS FOCUS ON THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO FIND ADDITIONAL KITCHEN INFRASTRUCTURE IN TRAINING GRANTS WE RECOMMEND TO THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED A REDUCED AMOUNT OF ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THESE GRANTS THIS IS ONE THIRD OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED AMOUNT BUT IT MATCHES THE AMOUNT PROVIDED IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. THE PRIMARY REASON WE'RE RECOMMENDING APPROVING A REDUCED AMOUNT IS BECAUSE THE STATE DOES NOT CURRENTLY HAVE A CLEAR SENSE OF THE TOTAL COST OF KITCHEN INFRASTRUCTURE UPGRADES ASSOCIATED WITH IMPLEMENTING UNIVERSAL MEALS AT THIS TIME ESPECIALLY SINCE THE STATE ALREADY PROVIDED FUNDING FOR THESE ACTIVITIES AND THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO PROJECT. WE DO EXPECT SOME MORE INFORMATION TO BE MADE AVAILABLE AFTER JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY THREE WHICH IS WHEN ELOISE MUST REPORT HOW THE FIRST ROUND OF FUNDING WAS USED WE ALSO RECOMMEND PRIORITIZING THIS FUNDING FOR IMPLEMENTING UNIVERSAL MEALS RATHER THAN THE CORPORATION OF FRESH FOODS THEIR SCRATCH COOKING SCHOOLS WILL HAVE TO MANAGE A VARIETY OF CHALLENGES IN THE NEAR TERM INCLUDING IMPLEMENTING UNIVERSAL MEALS STAFFING SHORTAGES AND INCREASED FOOD AND EQUIPMENT COSTS. FOR THESE REASONS WE BELIEVE EDUCATIONAL FUNDING FOR SCRATCH COOKING TO MEET SOMEONE M. PREMATURE AT THIS TIME WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE COULD REVISIT FUNDING FOR BOTH UNIVERSAL MEALS. AND SCRATCH COOKING IN FUTURE YEARS ONCE MORE IT. ABOUT DEMAND AND THE USE OF THE TWENTY TWENTY TWO GRANTS AND- LASTLY THE LEAD THE PROPOSAL FOR THE GRANTS TO TARGET DISTRICTS THAT ARE MOST IMPACTED BY UNIVERSAL MEALS. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ALLOCATES A PORTION OF FUNDING TO DISTRICTS WITH AT LEAST 30% OF STUDENTS QUALIFYING FOR FREE OR REDUCED PRICE MEALS. THIS APPROACH LIKELY EXCLUDES DISTRICTS THAT NEED TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THEIR CAPACITY TO IMPLEMENT UNIVERSAL MEALS INCLUDING THOSE NOT CURRENTLY OFFERING SCHOOL LUNCH OR BREAKFAST. AND THOSE WITH LOWER SHARES OF STUDENTS ELIGIBLE FOR FREE OR REDUCED PRICE MEALS. ENSURE SMOOTHER IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER ALLOCATING FUNDING BASED ON SOME MEASURE OF NEEDED CAPACITY SUCH AS SOME PROJECTION OF HOW MANY MORE BILLS A DISTRICT WE NEED TO SERVE. UNDER UNIVERSAL MEALS COMPARED TO A PRIOR BASELINE LEVEL. AND THAT CONCLUDES MY TESTIMONY BUT HAPPY ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME RUBIO. THANK YOU AT THE PARTNER THE CATION. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN BIRDS OF THE COMMITTEE CAMP FRIENDS SELL DIRECTOR OF NUTRITION SERVICES WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TODAY I'M TESTIFYING ON BEHALF OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION TONY THURMOND. THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION IS INCREDIBLY GRATEFUL FOR ALL THE INVESTMENTS AND SCHOOL MEALS AND ENSURING THAT ALL OF OUR STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO BOTH A NUTRITIOUS BREAKFAST. AND THE LUNCH EACH SCHOOL DAY. THIS INVESTMENT TRULY ELEVATES THE IMPORTANCE OF HEALTHY SCHOOL MEALS AS A VITAL ELEMENT TO A STUDENT'S OVERALL EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE AND ALSO PROVIDES OUR LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES ELEAZAR WITH MUCH NEEDED ONGOING FINANCIAL RESPITE TO MAKE IT HAPPEN. STEADY'S CONFIRM THAT THERE IS INCREASED PARTICIPATION SCHOOL MALES FROM ALL STUDENTS REGARDLESS OF THEIR ECONOMIC STATUS WHEN MALES ARE MADE AVAILABLE AT NO COST FOR ALL. AND UNFORTUNATELY THE PANDEMIC HAS REVEALED JUST HOW TRULY ESSENTIAL SCHOOL MEAL PROGRAMS ARE COMBATING BUILT IN SECURITY FOR ALL OF OUR STUDENTS. NOT JUST LOW INCOME BUT MODERATE TO MIDDLE INCOME AS WELL. DECADES CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN A NATIONAL LEADER IN ESTABLISHING GREATER ACCESS TO HEALTHY MEALS AND YOU'VE HEARD FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND L. A. L. THE OVERVIEW OF THE BUDGET AND THE INVESTMENTS AND UNIVERSAL MALES. THIS BUDGET REALLY HELPS THAT OUR SCHOOLS UP FOR GREATER SUCCESS IN IMPLEMENTING A SUSTAINABLE UNIVERSAL MALES PROGRAM. THE DESIGN OF THE UNIVERSAL MALES PROGRAM IS INTENTIONAL TO SUPPLEMENT NOT SUPPLANT THE FEDERAL MAIL PROGRAMS IN TWO WAYS ONE BY REQUIRING SCHOOLS IN ORDER TO RECEIVE THE STATE REIMBURSEMENT. TO BE ON THE NATIONAL SCHOOL LUNCH AND SCHOOL BREAKFAST PROGRAM AND SUDDENLY. TO REALLY MAXIMIZE THE FULL AMOUNT OF FEDERAL FUNDING BY REQUIRING HIGH PRIVATE POVERTY SCHOOLS TO IMPLEMENT COMMUNITY ELIGIBILITY. OR PROVISION AND THE NEXT SCHOOL YEAR. CURRENTLY THERE'S ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED SIX ELEAZAR AT OVER FORTY TWO HUNDRED SCHOOL SITES PARTICIPATING AND COMMUNITY ELIGIBILITY PROVISION TO. AND WE ESTIMATE THAT THERE'S OVER A LEVIN HUNDRED SCHOOL SITES PARTICIPATING IN NATIONAL SCHOOL LUNCH SCHOOL BREAKFAST PROGRAM THAT ARE ELIGIBLE FOR A COMMUNITY ELIGIBILITY SO ALL OF THE SCHOOLS IMPLEMENTED COMMUNITY ELIGIBILITY. THERE WOULD BE A COST SAVINGS TO THE STATE UNIVERSAL MALES PROGRAM BECAUSE WE WOULD BE TOP DRAWING DOWN MORE FEDERAL FUNDS AT THE FREE RATE. THE PROPOSED FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION-DOLLARS IN THE KITCHEN AND FOR STRUCTURE AND TRAINING FUND THAT FORMULA HONORS THE NEEDS OF OUR ELEAZAR IT REALLY TRULY RECOGNIZES THAT NOT ALL SCHOOLS ARE THE SAME. REGARDLESS OF THE SCHOOL IS HIGH POVERTY WITH OR HAS HIGH FREE AND REDUCED OR MODERATE FREE AND REDUCED PRICE STUDENT POPULATION THEY EACH HAVE UNIQUE NEEDS AND SCHOOLS NEED CHOICE AND OPTIONS AND HOW TO USE THESE VALUABLE RESOURCES. THE FUNDING ALLOCATIONS ALLOW SCHOOLS TO IMPLEMENT OR EXPAND SERVICES AND VERY INNOVATIVE WAYS THAT BEST MEET THEIR NEEDS. I COULD BE MORE SCRATCH COOKING IT QUOTE WHICH HAS BEEN A PROVEN% STRATEGY- WITH THE CURRENT SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUES IT COULD BE CREATING MORE POINT OF SERVICE OPTIONS. EXTENDING MAIL SERVICE AND- MEAL TIMES OFFERING NEW BREAKFAST MODELS DEVELOPING SAP STAFF SKILLS ARE PURCHASING EQUIPMENT ARE REPAIRING EQUIPMENT THAT IS NEEDED. THE RESPONSE TO THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO KITCHEN INFRASTRUCTURE TRAINING FUND'S BEEN INCREDIBLY POSITIVE AND WE'RE HEARING FROM SCHOOLS THAT THEIR NEEDS ARE GOING TO BE ON GOING ESPECIALLY OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. AS WE COME OUT OF THE PANDEMIC. SCHOOLS HAVE SEEN DECREASES BILL PARTICIPATION OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS AS MUCH AS 11% WHEN WE COMPARE SEPTEMBER TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TO SEPTEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THIRTY TRULY STRUGGLING TO REBOUND- FROM THE PANDEMIC THE SUPPLY CHAIN CHALLENGES INFLATION STAFFING SHORTAGES AND ADDRESSING DECLINING ENROLLMENTS INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED SIXTEEN ALLEYS ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE THESE BONDS NINE HUNDRED AND FORTY REGISTERED TO RECEIVE THE WAITED EIGHTY FOUR RESPONSE RATE FOR THE KITCHEN INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THIS YEAR. AND THERE REALLY ARE FOOD SERVER STRUCTURES ARE REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO REBUILDING THEIR PROGRAMS AND GETTING BACK TO ME THE FRESH QUALITY CHOICES THAT EXISTED BEFORE THE PANDEMIC. BUT UNFORTUNATELY FOR THE PAST TWELVE YEARS THE USDA FEDERAL EQUIPMENT GRANT THAT'S AVAILABLE TO SCHOOLS ON THE NATIONAL SCHOOL LUNCH PROGRAM HAS NEVER BEEN SUFFICIENTLY FUNDED TO SUPPORT ALL OF CALIFORNIA'S REQUEST IT FALLS. BAR SHORT OF THE NEEDS OF OUR KITCHEN AND THEY EQUIPMENT NEEDS OF OUR ALLEY AS AND FAR TOO MANY ALLEYS ARE EXCLUDED. AND THIS YEAR IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE FEDERAL COMMITMENT GRANT- WE RECEIVED THREE HUNDRED. AT THE I'M SORRY THREE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDING BUT WE RECEIVED OVER SEVENTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDING REQUEST RALLY AS THIS IS WHY THE KITCHEN INFRASTRUCTURE AND TRAINING FUNDS ARE SO IMPORTANT. WE'RE CURRENTLY PARTNERING WITH UC BERKELEY NUTRITION POLICY INSTITUTE TWO A SURVEY EVALUATE FOOD SERVICE DIRECTORS ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF UNIVERSAL MALES THEIR CONCERNS THEIR NEEDS RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING JUST LAST WEEK WE HAD OVER THREE IN OUR FORTY FIVE JUST US- DIRECTORS RESPONDING AND THERE ARE ABOUT 82% ARE SAYING INADEQUATE EQUIPMENT LACK OF SPACE. STAFFING SHORTAGES AND NEED FOR ONGOING FINDING AS A COMMON CONCERNS. SO WE DO NOT KNOW THAT WHEN OUR SCHOOLS HAVE THE RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED THAT THEY ARE VERY SUCCESSFUL AND MEETING THE DEMANDS OF THE PANDEMIC AS WELL AS FUTURE OUTAGES AND FOOD SUPPLY ISSUES BUT THEY NEED THAT EQUIPMENT SO THAT THEY CAN BE NIMBLE AND THEIR PROCUREMENT THEIR PRODUCTION AND DELIVERY. METHODS AND AT THE END OF THE DAY WE THEY NEED A RELIABLE EQUIPMENT TO PLAN OUT IN FUTURE YEARS FOR EQUIPMENT EXPANSION AND ORDERING SCRATCH COOKING IS AN OPTION FOR. OPTION FOR MANY OF OUR SCHOOLS BEGAN THEY HAVE SHARE THAT THAT HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL THROUGH THE PANDEMIC AND ADDRESSING WHEN FOOD HAS NOT BEEN AVAILABLE QUANTITIES OR THE SUPPLY CHAIN. THE CALIFORNIA UNIVERSAL MILLS PROGRAM IS INTENDED TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO BREAKFAST AND LUNCH. AND WE WANT THEM TO BE APPEALING AND SOMETHING OUR STUDENTS LOOK FORWARD TO EATING SOME CLOSING CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO LEAD THE WAY LONG TERM INVESTMENTS IN OUR CHILDREN'S OVERALL WELLBEING AND ACADEMIC SUCCESS BY BREAKING DOWN FOOD ACCESS TO SCHOOL MEALS. WE APPRECIATE YOUR COMMITMENT TO THE ON GOING FUNDING OF UNIVERSAL MALES AND WE DO LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND LEGISLATURE ON THE KITCHEN BUT TRUCKS ARE PROPOSAL THANK YOU AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. OKAY THANK YOU. THEY HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ON THIS ITEM. I JUST AS A LEVEL ONE QUESTION AND THIS WAS SIMILAR TO. WE TALK ABOUT THE AFTER SCHOOL ONE AND THAT'S- HOW THIS IS RELATING TO THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND I COULD KERR THAT YOU KNOW MR TANGUAY RAISED EARLIER ARE OUR CLIENT IS THE COMMUNITY AND THE SIX MILLION STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA HOW THAT WORKS FOR THEM WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH THOUSAND SCHOOL DISTRICTS SO. FOR FIRST CD II OR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- HOW IS IT- HOW'S IT GOING WORKING WITH R. KELLY AS AND THIS NEW UNIVERSAL MANTRA. WELL GOOD CAN CAMPAIGNS DEPARTMENT EDUCATION CERTAINLY I'M SCHOOLS AS WE KNOW COME IN ALL SHAPES AND SIZES AND SO CONCERNED LEVEL IS ON AT DIFFERENT LEVELS WE ARE OFFERING A MONTHLY TOWN HALLS TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SUPPORT RESOURCES TO HELP WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION AND TO ANSWER QUESTIONS FOR THEM TO MAKE THEM SUCCESSFUL AND- YOU KNOW WE WILL CONTINUE THAT THROUGH THE COMING YEAR CHIU AND PARTNERING THEM WITH BEST PRACTICES AND RESOURCES FOR THEIR SUCCESS. OKAY. YOU HAVE A FURTHER COMMENT THE OTHER PARTICIPANTS. I DON'T HAVE ANY FURTHER COMMENT I THINK I WAS JUST GOING TO HIGHLIGHT THE- SAME THING AS AS- MY COLLEAGUE KIM DID YOU KNOW THAT THAT THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT AND- YOU KNOW POINTS- ALL OF THESE- YOU KNOW THE TOWN HALL WEAPON ARMS AND THE- WE UNIVERSAL MEALS. LISTINGS SESSIONS THAT THEY HAVE BEEN HOLDING. UP WITH ELLIE ACE. OKAY THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT WE WILL HOLD THIS ISSUE OPEN- NEXT ISSUE IS ISSUE NUMBER THREE THE BUDGET PROPOSAL WAY TO GREEN SCHOOL TRANSPORTATION AND CHARTER FACILITY MAINTENANCE. PLEASE PROCEED BERMAN A FINANCE ALEJO THE DEPARTMENT OF ED IN THE TREASURER'S OFFICE. THAT CLEAN A GRANT OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE GOOD MORNING AGAIN- SO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES ONE POINT FIVE BILLION ONE TIME PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT THE SCHOOL TRANSPORTATION GRANT PROGRAM AND THAT'S IT TO FOCUS ON CREATING SCHOOL BUS FLEETS IN THE STATE. SPECIFICALLY GRANTS OF AT LEAST FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND WOULD BE AVAILABLE WITH PRIORITY FOR RETIRING OUR LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES OLDEST INTERNAL COMBUSTION BUSES- ELEAZAR THE HIGHEST CONCENTRATIONS OF UNDUPLICATED PUPILS AS WELL SMALL AND RURAL AND LIAISE AND IN KEEPING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION'S LARGER FOCUS ON REDUCING HARMFUL VEHICLE EMISSIONS- WITH GRANTS OF FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND AND ELLIE A WOULD BE ABLE TO. ACQUIRE AN ELECTRIC SCHOOL BUS PURCHASE AND CONSTRUCT THE BUSES CHARGING STATION AD SUPPORT OTHER LOCAL A SCHOOL BUS TRANSPORTATION NEEDS. IS INVESTMENTS. WILL RESULT IN ONGOING SAVINGS TO TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS THAT COULD BE USED TO SUPPORT OTHER ASPECTS OF AN ALLEY AS- APPROPRIATE STUDENT TRANSPORT- PROGRAMS- THIS CONCLUDES MY PREFERMENTS OR- ANY QUESTIONS THE APPROPRIATE TIME. OKAY THANK YOU. DO WE HAVE A DELL AT THE CURRENT FINANCE FOR EACH ISSUE FOR THE CHARTER ISSUE AND YES OKAY CORRECT. YEAH GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN BIRDS JENNIFER TALKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL FINANCE AUTHORITY PROVIDES FACILITIES AND WORKING CAPITAL FINANCING JUST SCHOOL DISTRICTS COMMUNICATORS DISTRICTS COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION AND CHARTER SCHOOLS THE CHARTER SCHOOL FACILITY GRANT PROGRAM PROVIDES PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND GRANTS TO ASSIST CHARTER SCHOOLS WITH RENT AND LEASE COSTS. THIS PROGRAM TARGET SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITIES WITH SIGNIFICANT POPULATIONS OF ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES AN AUGMENTATION OF THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS ONGOING PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT OTHER ELIGIBLE FACILITIES COST BUT THE CHARTER SCHOOL FACILITY GRANT PROGRAM. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO PROPOSES AN ADDITIONAL TWO POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS FOR COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT AN ADDITIONAL SIX MILLION DOLLARS FOR WORKLOAD ADJUSTMENT THE CHARTER SCHOOL FACILITY GRANT PROGRAM. I JUST NEED TO THE AND- INVEST THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROVIDES SEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION GENERAL FUND TO COMPLETE DESIGN OF THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF FREMONT CALIFORNIA SCHOOL FOR THE BLIND FREMONT STUDENT HOUSING MODERNIZATION. CONTINUING UP PROJECT FIRST FUNDED IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT. THIS PROJECT CONSISTS OF THE RENOVATION OF TWENTY SIX HOUSING BUILDINGS AS WELL AS IMPROVEMENTS UTILITIES AND PASS TRAVEL. WITHOUT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AM I CALLED KALI BARBARA KELLER'S ONLINE TO RESPOND TO ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE CAPITAL OUTLAY INVESTMENT FOR THE STATE SPECIAL SCHOOLS THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU. HELLO YOU KEEP THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS CAN COUPON WITH THE ANALYST'S OFFICE I'LL START WITH THE SCHOOL TRANSPORTATION PROPOSAL. IN JUST SOME BRIEF BACKGROUND HERE SCHOOL DISTRICTS OWN NEARLY SIXTEEN THOUSAND SCHOOL BUSES ONLY TWO THIRDS OF THOSE ARE DIESEL BUSES AND MANY OF THOSE DIESEL BUSES ARE OLDER MODELS THAT WERE MANUFACTURED UNDER LESS STRINGENT EMISSION STANDARDS IN THOSE EXISTING TODAY. A BATTERY ELECTRIC BUSES ARE RELATIVELY NEW MY CHIN DISTRICTS BEGAN BUYING THEM ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO AND CURRENTLY OWNS SEVERAL HUNDRED STATEWIDE. ELECTED BUSES HOUSE MENTAL ADVANTAGES DID NOT PRODUCE DETAILED EMISSIONS THAT CAN HARM HUMAN HEALTH. THEY MIGHT SNIFFING LESS GREENHOUSE GAS AND IT CAN BE LESS EXPENSIVE TO OPERATE. THE MAIN IMITATION IS THE RANGE MANY MODELS TODAY HAVE A MAXIMUM RANGES BETWEEN A HUNDRED AND TWENTY AND A HUNDRED FIFTY MILES. AND THAT MEANS NOTHING BE LESSEN STRENUOUS CONDITIONS LIKE MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN OR HOT OR COLD WEATHER. THEY ALSO THE HIGHER UPFRONT COST ABOUT TWICE AS MUCH AS A DIESEL BUS. I THINK THE ADMINISTRATION GIVE YOU A GOOD OVERVIEW OF THE PROPOSAL SO IT IS ON TOP OF A LARGE FEDERAL PROGRAM CREATED LAST NOVEMBER. THE FUND AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS STATE PROGRAM CREATED IN THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET. COUPLE SMALLER STATE PROGRAMS. AND WE THINK THE ADMINISTRATION'S ADVANCED A PROMISING IDEA USING ONE TIME FUNDS TO PURCHASE ELECTRIC BUSES COULD PROVIDE MISSION BENEFITS THAT WILL LAST FOR MANY YEARS. AND AGAIN DISTRICTS SOME COST RELIEF RELATED REPLACING OLDER BUSES AND PROGESTIN. WOULD RECOMMEND ADOPTING THE PROPOSAL WITH A COUPLE MODIFICATIONS. ARE THE FIRST TO BE TO PRIORITIZE THE PLACEMENT OF THE OLDEST BUSES I SWEAR AS THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES THE AGE OF THE BUSES AS ONE FACTOR WE RECOMMEND MAKING IT THE MAIN FACTOR. GENERALLY OLDER BUSES EMIT MORE POLLUTION SO PLACED IN THE OLDEST ONES FIRST WOULD MAXIMIZE THE POTENTIAL AIR QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS. A SECOND WE RECOMMEND ALLOWING FUNDING FOR OTHER TYPES OF BUSES ELECTRIC BUSES ARE NOT FEASIBLE. THIS IS MAINLY AN ISSUE THAT AFFECTS REAL DISTRICTS OF LONG STRENUOUS ROUTE. IN THOSE DISTRICTS REPLACEMENT THEY'RE NOT ELECTED BUS WITH THE NEW. BUSQUETS ACHIEVE. REDUCTIONS IN POLLUTION TEMPERATE ALLOWANCE FOR OTHER TRANSPORTATION COSTS. ARE THAT PART OF THE PROPOSAL DOES. NOT SEEM CLEARLY CONNECTED WITH THE UNDERLYING BECAUSE IS PRETTY SIMILAR. BUS FOR RUNNING A SCHOOL TRUST. PROGRAM AND WE HAVE SOME KIND THAT IT CA DISCOURAGE DISTRICTS. FOR PLACE FUNDING FROM THE OTHER PROGRAMS THAT DON'T OFFER THAT. OF A LOT STARTING WITH A SMALL AND MARK LEE FOR THE FOR. AND FUTURE FUND OVER SO YEARS. THAT WOULD PROVIDE THE LATEST NOT BUT TO A DISTRICT IN. IN PROGRESS FOR TO PLAY SOME THE BUSES. ONE OUT COULD BE TO WITH THE NEW ON OF FIVE MILLION. AND AFTER PLACE THAN I THOUGHT BUSES. LYNCH AND FIX UP THE CURRENT IN A TWO YEARS. IF YOU JUST WITH SOMETHING CLOSE TO THE FULL FIVE FIVE BILLION. WOULD RECOMMEND ALLOWING SOME OF IT TO BE TRICKS DISTRICT. NOT A PLACE BY. THAT WOULD SAFETY CARE THE FULHAM INTEREST DESTROY. LASTLY WE SEE POSITIONED TO. THE WE CAN PUT A CREDIT. IS KEEPING OF MAN THE PROBE. THERE ARE MANY TYPES OF CONTENT GRANTS. AND THE PREVIOUS MANAGED DOCTORS PLACEMENT FOR. FIRST DISTRICTS. ON THE OTHER HAND THE CAL AREAS BOARD ALREADY WILL RECEIVE THE BEST OF THE FOR COULD LAST YEAR'S BUDGET. AND DIVIDING TO FROM ACROSS THE TWO H. I WOULDN'T THEM ENGAGE IN THAT COURTNEY. SINCE NEED LIKE APPLY BOTH DRUG. FINDING THIS NEW PROGRAM TO THE YOUR RESEARCH FOR MY DEVOID SOME OF THAT BACK AND FORTH. INSTREAM THE FUNDING OF. PROCESS I SHOULD IN THE CHARTER SCHOOLS. AT THE- FOR THE FACILITY PARK SEEMS WITH ALLOWABLE. FOR THE PROGRAM CURRENTLY. AND WE HAVE NO WITH THAT BEFORE. HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU TIME. OKAY THANK YOU NAY OIL. I THANK YOU MISTER SECOND INCLUDES A COMMENTS ON THE ON THE APPLE'S GOT. I HAD TO NEED TO OKAY THANK YOU BERMAN OF EDUCATION. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR THERE WAS A COMMITTEE MY NAME IS JUAN MORALES THE TO. OF THE SCHOOL ADDRESS. SERVICES DIVISION OF. AND IT'S A PLEASURE TO HERE WITH TODAY TO PROVIDE YOU SOME OPEN REMARKS BEHALF OF STATE SHOULD. OF PUBLIC AND TO THURMOND. WE WANT TO START OUT BY. THE GOVERNOR FOR PAPA SUCH A SIGNAL% INVEST IS TRANSFER. WE THAT MAY FAMILY RELY ON SCHOOL BUS TO BE ABLE TO SCHOOL DAY. IN FACT IT IS ESTIMATED THAT CLOSED MILLION. ARE TRANS DAILY. LAST THERE IS A SCHOOL. ON A SCHOOL BUS NOT ONLY THIS. WAY TO GET THE SCHOOL. BUT ALSO HELPS THROUGH. OTHER CAR FROM THE AS WELL SCHOOL BUS AND THE- OF A THIRTY SIX CARS. WE ALSO AGREE THAT OLDER SCHOOL BUSES NEED TO BE REPLACED WITH NEWER TECHNOLOGY. THAT WILL NOT ONLY HELP CALIFORNIA ACHIEVE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS. BUT THEY WILL ALSO HELP LOWER THE OPERATIONAL COST. FOR OUR DAILY AS IN THE NEAR AND THE LONG TERM THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSED INTO INVEST ONE POINT FIVE BILLION. FOR THE CREATION OF THE SCHOOL TRANSPORTATION GRANT PROGRAM TO REPLACE OLDER BUSES AND SOME OF THE- AREAS OF THE STATE. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT THE FUNDING WILL REPLACE APPROXIMATELY THREE THOUSAND OLDER SCHOOL BUSES. SO THE IMPACT THAT THIS INVESTMENTS GOING TO HAVE ON OUR SCHOOLS ON OUR COMMUNITIES AND THE ENVIRONMENT IN GENERAL IS QUITE CLEAR. OF COURSE MISTER SUCH A LARGE AMOUNT OF FUNDING THROUGH A COMPETITIVE PROCESS WOULD REQUIRE DEDICATED RESOURCES TO ENSURE THE PROGRAM'S SUCCESS. WE DO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL. AND WITH ME HERE TODAY IS ALSO MISS ANNA BORJAS WHO LEADS OUR OFFICES SCHOOL TRANSPORTATION AND WE CAN BOTH BE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU. OKAY THAT'S OKAY WE'LL GO NOW TO THE STATE TREASURER'S OFFICE. I AM GOOD MORNING COMMITTEE MEMBERS ENTER MCCARTY MY NAME IS KATRINA KAIF HANSHIN AND I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL FINANCE AUTHORITY THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THIS MORNING- AS YOU KNOW C. AS THE BASIN MINISTER THE CHARTER SCHOOL FACILITY GRANT PROGRAM SINCE TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN. SINCE THAT TIME WE HAVE SEEN DEMAND FOR THE PROGRAM GROW AT THE COSTA FACILITIES THE MAINTENANCE OF THAT FACILITY HAS OUTPACED AVAILABLE FUNDING TO THIS PROGRAM. IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE BUSINESS AUGMENTATION IS NOT A NEW FUNDING CATEGORY THE PROGRAM GIVES PRIORITY TO RENT LEASE COST AND IF FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE AFTER READING THESE COSTS ARE PAID OTHER COSTS ARE FUNDED. THE LAW STATES THAT THESE FUNDS MAY BE USED FOR COST INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH REMODELING BUILDINGS DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND STALLING. ORG'S EXTENDING SERVICE SYSTEMS AND OTHER BUILT IN EQUIPMENT AND IMPROVING SITES. THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN FUNDING ROUND WITH THE LAST TIMES YESTERDAY WAS ABLE TO FIND OTHER COST UNDER THIS PROGRAM AND DURING THAT FUNDING ROUND ELIGIBLE APPLICANTS RECEIVED ONLY 46% OF ELIGIBLE COSTS UNDER THIS CATEGORY. THE NEW ONE ON THE FUNDING. BEING PER BY THE- WILL ENSURE THAT CHARTER SCHOOLS. ARE WELL MAINTAINED AND SAFE FOR STUDENTS IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE SCHOOLS TOTAL AWARD WILL NEVER EXCEED THE AWARD CAP DETERMINED BY EACH SCHOOL'S AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE. ADDITIONALLY IF APPROVED THE USE THAT THEY WILL WORK TO IMPLEMENT ANY NECESSARY VERY REGULATORY CHANGES RELATED TO FUNDING FOR COALBED RELATED MITIGATION AND PREVENTION. AS WELL AS WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO ENSURE THAT THE AUTHORITY HAS ADEQUATE RESOURCES TO CARRY OUT THIS FUNDING AUGMENTATION. AND INEFFICIENT AND PRUDENT MANNER- I ALSO HAVE MY COLLEAGUES RYAN'S STORY AND JEFF MARTIN AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU. I WANT TO TALK FIRST ABOUT THE- THE SCHOOL BUS ISSUE- I THINK IT'S GREAT THAT WE ARE ELECTRIFYING OUR OUR SCHOOLS TRANSPORTATION- FULLY THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA- ANOTHER ISSUE ABOUT SCHOOL BUSES THERE'S LEGISLATION ON WHICH THAT MORE OF THAT ACT I DON'T I KNOW OUR UTILIZATION OF SCHOOL TRANSPORTATION IS VERY VERY LOUD IN CALIFORNIA I KNOW WHEN I SEE IT SCHOOL BUS DRIVING BY. NEVER SEEN ANYBODY ON THAT BUS BUT THAT'S ANOTHER STORY- I DO NOTE THAT WE HAVE A SURGE IN ONE TIME MONEY I DO- SHARE THE- YOU KNOW THE QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS THIS YEAR AND OVER TIME I KNOW MISTER O'DONNELL DOES THE SAME ABOUT UTILIZING- PROP NINETY EIGHT MONIES FOR THINGS OTHER THAN CLASSROOM AND SCHOOL INFRASTRUCTURE SO YOU KNOW IT SEEMS THAT WE COULD USE OTHER- ONE TIME MONIES WHICH WE HAVE PLENTY OF FOR THIS GREEN. A SCHOOL BUS INFRASTRUCTURE AND USE THAT ONE TIME PROP NINETY EIGHT FUNDS FOR OUR FACILITIES- I KNOW THIS PROPOSAL FOR MURDER EDUCATION COMMITTEE CHAIR TO IN OUR SCHOOL BOND IN PAST YEARS AGO TO LOOK AT AS MUCH AS WE CAN A ONE TIME NINETY EIGHT MONEY FOR- FOR SCHOOL FACILITIES MODERNIZATION OR CONSTRUCTION SO FORTH SO I WOULD RATHER FOCUS ON THAT. AND THEN- I THINK IT- THERE ARE SOME. ON THE ON GOING PROP NINETY EIGHT. FOR THE- SCHOOL LEASE FACILITIES ESPECIALLY- FOR THE CHARTER FACILITIES ESPECIALLY- PRIVATELY OWNED- PROPERTY- WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE LEASE IS UP. I MEAN IF IT'S A GOVERNMENT BUILDING I GET IT IT'S GOING TO BE IN GOVERNMENT FOR PERPETUITY- I KNOW FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S ITS CHARTER ENTITY HERE IN SACRAMENTO I THINK IT'S CALLED SABA. AND THEY HAVE MULTIPLE SITES ONE IS AT A FORMER COMMUNITY CENTER IN MY DISTRICT AND A FAKE. RETROFITTED THAT IS SOMETHING THERE IT'S OWNED BY THE CITY IT'S A COMMUNITY CENTER AND OTHER. SITE YOU KNOW A FEW MILES AWAY IS THAT A STRIP MALL AND IF THEY- DID SOME- YOU KNOW UPGRADES THERE AND SO FORTH WHEN THE LEASE IS UP YOU KNOW ISN'T THAT A WINDFALL THE PROPERTY OWNER NOW NOT THE TAXPAYERS SO. I DO HAVE SOME SOME SOME ISSUES AND QUESTIONS THAT. YEAH ANY ISSUES ACROSS HERE MR GOLF. YES- AMID THANK AND I DO TO HIGHLIGHT SCHOOL BUS ISSUE THAT SHOULD COME FOR NON EIGHT DOLLARS- USING THOSE. USING NINETY EIGHT PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT DOLLARS THAT COULD GO TO REDUCE CLASS SIZES FOR THE NEXT FEW YEARS ADDRESS MENTAL HEALTH IN SCHOOLS IS A BETTER PLACE. TO PUT THESE DOLLARS AND WHAT QUITE FRANKLY WHAT OFTEN ARE EXPERIMENTAL BUSES- IF YOU JUST LOOK AT. WHAT WE'RE ENCOURAGING DISTRICTS TO DO IS PROBABLY SPENT ABOUT A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. ON THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO CHARGE A BUS ALONE. IT IS A HUNDRED FIFTY NINE OF THE BUS YET. HE THEN YOU GET WHAT ONE BUS- THERE ARE WHAT ABOUT THOUSAND SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT'S NOT REALLY A REASONABLE APPROACH THOSE DOLLARS SHOULD BE SPENT IN THE CLASSROOM LOOK WE HAVE THE LARGEST CLASS SIZES. IN CALIFORNIA THAN ANY OTHER STATE AND TO SPEND THE MONEY ON LECTURED. FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS I DON'T THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA NINE NINE NINE NINETY EIGHT LET'S HAVE THAT CONVERSATION BUT USING CLASSROOM DOLLARS FOR THAT PURPOSE. AGAIN IS TO ME JUST CHASING THE SHINY OBJECT A SHINY OBJECT TO ME. IS THE ACADEMIC SUCCESS OF OUR STUDENTS I WITH THAT AND JUST OVER TO THE FACILITY SIDE- THAT CHARTER. SCHOOLS ARE LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE AN- AN ANNUAL DAY IN OTHER SCHOOLS ARE NOT- SO WE SHOULD LOOK AT PARITY FOR THAT AND REALLY A LOT OF THE DOLLAR SHOULD COME OUT OF NINETY EIGHT AS WELL. AS THEY DO FOR TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOLS- BUT A QUESTION FOR FINANCE IS I DO HAVE A QUESTION WHY WOULD THE STATE PROVIDE FUNDS TO RETROFIT A PRIVATELY OWNED FACILITY- THIS IS WHAT. IN THE CHARTER SCHOOL FACILITY GROW- GRANT PROGRAM. IS THAT REALLY A WISE USE OF PUBLIC MONEY AGAIN TO RETROFIT A PRIVATELY OWNED. FACILITY NOW FOR A PUBLIC ONE I THINK AN ARGUMENT CAN BE MADE. BUT PUT. BUT AND THIS IS JUST AGAIN SHOULD SAY DOLLARS GO FOR THIS PURPOSE THIS IS IN A NINETY EIGHT CONVERSATION. BUT AGAIN- COULD COULD- THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE RESPONDED THAT. HI JENNIFER TALKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. I WOULD JUST KNOW FIRST OFF THAT THIS INVESTMENT IS NOT EXPANDING THE PROGRAM THIS IS A PROGRAM THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN IN PLACE THAT WE'RE JUST PROVIDING FUNDS TO AUGMENT- SECOND OF ALL- WELL THIS PROGRAM DOES PROVIDE- LEASE COSTS IT'S- IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT CHARTER SCHOOLS DO NOT HAVE THE SAME ACCESS TO LOCAL BOND FUNDS TO SUPPORT THEIR FACILITY NEEDS- AND- THIS. AND SPEAKING TO PARITY THIS ON THIRTY MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT WAS INTENDED TO PROVIDE PARITY- ALONG WITH THE INVESTMENT WE'RE MAKING TO THE SCHOOL FACILITY PROGRAM. THANK YOU IS ONE OF THE CHARTER SCHOOLS. DO USE CONDUIT BONDS. TO SUPPORT THEIR FACILITIES THEY ALSO ARE. A PART OF TYPICALLY PART OF THE STATE- SCHOOL BOND- PROGRAM- BUT AGAIN WHAT WE ANOTHER QUESTION LONG THOSE LINES WHAT HAPPENS TO THESE TO A PRIVATE FACILITY WHEN A CHARTER SCHOOL SHUTS DOWN WHERE DID THEY GO. LET'S SEE A GOOD AMOUNT OF PUBLIC MONEY HAS BEEN INVESTED OF A SILLY WHAT THEN HAPPENS OF FACILITY SHOULD HAVE A CHARTER SCHOOL SHUT DOWN. AND SHOULD THERE BE A WAY TO RECOUP THE FUNDS. I'M JENNIFER FINANCING AND- SO TOTALLY WE'VE HEARD THAT CHARTER SCHOOL THAT THESE FACILITIES IF THEY ARE NO LONGER IN POSSESSION OF THAT THAT CHARTER SCHOOL NO LONGER IS RESIDING WITHIN THAT FACILITY. AT THAT IS THEN PASSED ALONG TO OTHER CHARTER SCHOOLS BUT FOR FURTHER COMMENT ON THAT I WOULD. DEFER TO MY COLLEAGUE AT THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL FINANCE AUTHORITY. DOES THE DOES THE SCHOOL FINANCE AUTHORITY WHICH TO COMMON. WE HAVE TO PULL TOGETHER- SOME DATA ON THAT AS IT RELATES TO PUBLIC VERSUS PRIVATE FACILITIES- YOU KNOW BUT I DID WANT TO NOTE THAT TYPICALLY THE INVESTMENT ON THE OTHER COST CATEGORIES ABOUT. WAS IT FORTY TWO THOUSAND RYAN- SO WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT MASSIVE RENOVATIONS ARE RETROFITTING- RYAN STORY OR JEFF MARTIN YOU HAVE THAT DATA IN FRONT OF YOU. THE LAST TIME THAT THESE COSTS WERE PAID OUT IN THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN- FUNDING ROUND. OKAY IT'S PUBLIC MONEY SO AGAIN THE CONCERN BEING WORD IS THIS PUBLIC MONEY GO AND THEN JUST- ONE OTHER COMMENT I DON'T REALLY NEED A RESPONSE TO IT I THINK WE DID YOU DO NEED TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT THE ELIGIBILITY WHERE. A SCHOOL CHARTER SCHOOL. MAY RECEIVE FUNDS- BASED ON THE NEIGHBORHOOD SITS IN. NOT THE STUDENTS IT SERVES THE OAKLAND BEING A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THAT SO I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT THEY'RE BEING ELIGIBLE THEY WERE THEN IN OTHER WORDS OUR CHARTER SCHOOL BEING ELIGIBLE FOR FUNDING BASED ON THE NEIGHBORHOOD IT'S A NOT THE STUDENTS IT SERVES. SO WITH THAT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. OKAY THANK YOU AND SO WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE- THERE- ON THOSE TWO ISSUES. WE WILL HOLD THIS ISSUE OPEN AND GO TO ISSUE NUMBER FOUR EARLY LITERACY. ELCHO DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- SO I'LL BE PRESENTING ON BOTH PROPOSALS- BUT MY COLLEAGUES FOR BRIAN'S ALSO TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME- FIRST THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES TWO HUNDRED MILLION- ONE I'M PROBABLY NINETY GENERAL FUND TO CREATE THE MULTILINGUAL CLASSROOM LIBRARY GRANT PROGRAMS EXPAND SCHOOL OR CLASSROOM LIBRARIES OFFERING CULTURALLY RELEVANT TEXTS- FUNDS WILL BE ALLOCATED TO SCHOOLS SERVING HIGH RATES OF LOW INCOME STUDENTS IN ENGLISH LEARNERS- AND CAN BE USED TO BUY BOOKS. TO ESTABLISH SCHOOL OR CLASSROOM LIBRARIES FOR STUDENTS IN PRESCHOOL THROUGH THIRD GRADE. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO PROPOSES FIVE HUNDRED MILLION ONETIME PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND FOR GRANTS TO HIGH NEED SCHOOLS TO TRAIN AND HIRE LITERACY COACHES- AND READING SPECIALISTS. THE MAJORITY OF THE FUNDING FOR THIS PROPOSAL- FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WILL BE ALLOCATED. TO ELIGIBLE SCHOOLS ON A PER STUDENT RATE- SUCH THAT NO ELIGIBLE SCHOOL RECEIVES LESS THAN THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. WE WANT THESE FUNDS TO GO TO OUR MOST HIGH NEED STUDENTS WHICH IS WHY ELIGIBLE SCHOOLS ARE DEFINED AS THOSE WITH ABOVE AND 95% RATE OF LOW INCOME STUDENTS- ENGLISH LEARNERS AND USE AND FOSTER CARE THIS PROPOSAL- TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IS PROVIDED TO CONTRACT WITH A LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCY. TO DEVELOP AND PROVIDE TRAINING FOR LITERACY COACHES AND REGION SPECIALISTS. WE SEE THESE TWO PROPOSALS AS BEING BACK WRITING AND RESEARCH- INCLUDING RESEARCH SHOWING THE POSITIVE IMPACT OF STRONG LIBRARY PROGRAMS. AND MULTILINGUAL BOOKS- AND DATA SHOWING THAT LITERACY COACHES MAKE A HUGE IMPACT IN THE LIVES OF STRUGGLING READERS- SO THAT CONCLUDES MY PRESENTATION- BUT MY COLLEAGUES FROM FINANCE AND I ARE AVAILABLE TO TAKE QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU I TO THE L. L. GOOD MORNING EMILY WITH L. A. L. AGAIN WE WANTED TO SHARE OUR ASSESSMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS ON TWO OF THE GOVERNOR'S EARLY LITERACY PROPOSALS SPECIFICALLY ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION ONE TIME FOR LITERACY COACHES WHICH INCLUDES TWENTY FIVE MILLION FOR STATEWIDE TRAINING FOR THESE COACHES. IN TWO HUNDRED MILLION ONE TIME FOR CULTURALLY RELEVANT AND MULTILINGUAL BOOKS OVERALL WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF BOTH PROPOSALS WHEN I WAS STATE EFFORTS TO IMPROVE EARLY LITERACY COULD BE WARRANTED WE FIND THAT SCHOOLS ALREADY HAVE A VARIETY OF EXISTING FUNDING SOURCES THERE% WHICH THEY CAN FIND ADDITIONAL LITERACY COACHES AND MULTILINGUALBOOKS INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT ONE TIME FOR ALL COVERED RELIEF FUNDS. AND OF COURSE I'LL SEE IF I HAVE FOR INSTANCE THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET PROVIDED A ONE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLAR ON GOING AUGMENTATION TO THE LCF CONCENTRATION GRANT TO HIRE MORE STAFF FOR DIRECT STUDENT SERVICES INCLUDING CLARITY COACHES IS AUGMENTATION TARGETS MANY OF THE DISTRICTS I WOULD RECEIVE FUNDING UNDER BOTH OF THE GOVERNOR'S K. TWELVE EARLY LITERACY PROPOSALS. WE CAN GUIDE MINISTRATIONS APPROACH OF PROVIDING RESTRICTED FUNDING FOR STERN EARLY LITERACY ACTIVITIES IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH THE ORIGINAL LEGISLATIVE INTENT THAT ELOISE LOCALLY DETERMINED AND FIND I ALREADY IS UNDER LCF HALF. ON THE LITERACY COACH PROPOSAL STUDIES SUGGEST THAT LITERACY COACHING CAN IMPROVE STUDENT READING TEST SCORES IF EXPERIENCE COACHES ARE PLACED IN THE LOWEST PERFORMING SCHOOLS FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS HOWEVER THE GOVERNOR'S LITERACY COACH PROPOSAL DOES NOT ALIGN WITH THE RESEARCH AND THREE KEY ASPECTS. FIRST THE PROPOSAL IS NOT TARGETED TO THE LOWEST PERFORMING SCHOOLS AS INDICATED UNDER THE SEAT SCHOOL ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM INSIDE THE PROPOSAL TARGETS FUNDING BASED ON STUDENT DEMOGRAPHICS SECOND TEMPORARY FUNDING COMPLEMENT THE PROPOSAL'S IMPACT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WOULD ONLY PROVIDE FUNDING FOR THREE YEARS. GIVEN THE TIME IT TAKES TO HIRE TRAIN AND PLAN FOR COACHING COACHES MAY JUST BE STARTING TO BE EFFECTIVE AROUND THE TIME THAT FUNDING EXPIRES. ALTHOUGH SCHOOLS MUST THE MOBILE LONG TERM FOR FUN BECAUSE- THERE'S NO GUARANTEE THAT THESE POSITIONS BE FUNDED IN THE FUTURE. ADDITIONALLY THE- LET TRILOGY. WOULD NOT PER SCHOOL FROM YOU THIS MY- TO SUPPLY EGGS. FUND FOR CO ALSO LIMITING THE IMPACT OF THIS PROPOSAL. LASTLY CURRENT STAFFING. DAYS COULD RESULT IN MANY AN EXPERIENCED BEING HIRED WE KNOW THAT MANY DISTRICTS ARE FACING WIDESPREAD STAFFING SHORTAGES INCLUDING FOR LITERACY COACH POSITIONS. EFFECTIVE LITERACY COACHES TYPICALLY HAVE SUCCESSFUL EXPERIENCES TEACHING% READING IN THE CLASSROOM. A STRONG GRASP OF READING INSTRUCTION AND INTERVENTION AND EXPERIENCE WORKING AND COACHING TEACHERS SUCH QUALIFIED LITERACY COACHES COULD BE DIFFICULT TO FIND IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS. ALTHOUGH THE ADMINISTRATION INTENDS TO ADDRESS THE- STAFFING LIMITATIONS THROUGH THE PROPOSED TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION FOR STATEWIDE TRAINING IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT SEE WHAT TRAINING WOULD EFFECTIVE. LEVERAGE THIS KNOWLEDGE GAP SINCE THIS TRAINING MIGHT NOT BE TAILORED TO EACH SCHOOL. ONTHE MULTILINGUAL BOOKS PROPOSAL TO DETERMINE VERY LITTLE RESEARCH ON THE IMPACT OF HAVING MORE MULTI LINGUAL BOOKS IN SCHOOL LIBRARIES ON CHILD LITERACY. MORE RESEARCH IS AVAILABLE ON THE BENEFITS OF READING TIME WHICH MAY INCLUDE READING IN OTHER LANGUAGES CHILDREN CAN ALSO ACCESS WHICH WHAT'S FROM THEIR LOCAL PUBLIC LIBRARY ADDITIONALLY PROVIDING MORE BOOKS IN SCHOOL AND LIBRARY. AND OUR CLASSROOMS LIBRARIES WOULD NOT DIRECTLY IMPROVED OR RESULT IN INEFFECTIVE INSTRUCTION WHICH WOULD BENEFIT STUDENTS MOST WE THINK OTHER STATE INITIATIVES CAN BETTER SUPPORT ENGLISH LEARNERS. SUCH AS INCREASING THE NUMBER OF BILINGUAL TEACHERS AND PROVIDING MORE TRAINING FOR TEACHERS TO BETTER SUPPORT ENGLISH LEARNERS. LASTLY FOR BOTH PROPOSALS WE FOUND THAT SOME VERY SMALL SCHOOLS WITH FEWER THAN TEN STUDENTS IN THE QUALIFYING GREETS FANS WOULD QUALIFY FOR SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF FUNDING. GIVEN THE ELIGIBILITY FOR BOTH PROPOSALS ARE OVERLAPPING A VERY SMALL SCHOOL MEETING BOTH CRITERIA COULD RECEIVE MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN BASE FUNDING FROM THE TWO PROPOSALS ALONE. BECAUSE OF THESE REASONS WE WERE I CAN THE LEGISLATURE REJECT THE PROPOSED FUNDING LITERACY COACHES MULTI. BOOK BRING UP SEVEN HUNDRED FOR OTHER WERE IN. IN FINDING THESE FOR. WE OFFER SEVERAL MODIFICATIONS FIRST ON A LITERACY COACH PROPOSAL THE LEGISLATURE COULD EXTEND THE TIMELINE FROM THREE YEARS TO FIVE YEARS IN CLARIFYING THAT FUNDS ARE INTENDED TO SUPPLEMENT. NOT SUPPLANT EXISTING FUNDING FOR BOTH REBELS OF THE LEGISLATURE COULD TARGET FUNDING BASED ON SCHOOLS IDENTIFIED AS LOW PERFORMING FOR STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT UNDER THE STATE'S ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM. AND LIMIT FUNDING TO SCHOOLS AND WILLING AT LEAST ELEVEN STUDENTS IN THE TARGETED EARLY GRADES THAT CONCLUDES MY COMMENTS BUT HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS DURING THE PERFECT TIME THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE SERENATA MORGAN DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT AT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ON BEHALF OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION TO MEET. WE ARE PLEASED TO SEE THESE PROPOSALS AS THEY RELATE STATE SUPERINTENDENT STATEWIDE LITERACY AND BY LITERACY CAMPAIGN AND MILLION BUCKS CAMPAIGN TO PROVIDE CHILDREN AND FAMILIES WITH ACCESS TO TAX. AS WELL AS OUR PRE K. TO THIRD GRADE INITIATIVE. REACHING LITERACY BY THIRD GRADE HAS LONG BEEN A GOAL OF CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS AND KEEP BENCHMARK IN MEASURING AND PREDICTING STUDENT SUCCESS. WE MUST TAKE BOLD ACTION TO HELP STUDENTS MEET THIS IMPORTANT MILESTONE AND TO PUT THEM ON THE PATH FOR LIFELONG LEARNING AND SUCCESS AS OPPOSED TO A PATH THAT INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THEY WILL DROP OUT OF SCHOOL OR END UP IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. OVER 70% OF INMATES IN AMERICA'S PRISONS CANNOT READ ABOUT A FOURTH GRADE LEVEL THAT NEEDS TOSTOP. AND THERE'S NO BETTER TIME THAN THE PRESENT WE ARE FOCUSED ON TRANSFORMING. CALIFORNIA'S EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM. SO STRAW LETTER ACQUISITION. REQUIRES BOTH. TO MANY BOOKS AND THOUGHTFUL. OF LIFE FOR TO BE MOST. TO THE- CULTURAL LINGUISTIC AND READABILITY NEEDS. AND ALSO REQUIRES EFFECTIVE PROFESSIONAL LEARNING AND SUPPORT. WE KNOW FROM RESEARCH THAT LITERACY COACHING IS MORE EFFECTIVE AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT TRAININGS OR WORKSHOPS ALONE. TRULY SUSTAIN TEACHER PRACTICE PROFESSIONAL LEARNING MUST BE ACTIVE COLLABORATIVE AND PROVIDE TEACHERS WITH AMPLE TIME TO LEARN PRACTICE IMPLEMENTED AND REFLECT ON NEW STRATEGIES. IN REGARDS TO THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION LITERACY COACHES PROPOSAL THE DEPARTMENT IS PLEASED TO SEE A STRONG INVESTMENT PROPOSED TO EMPLOY AND TRAIN LITERACY COACHES AND READING LITERACY SPECIALIST STATEWIDE. WHICH INCLUDES DEVELOPING SCHOOL LITERACY BROWN'S MENTOR TEACHERS AND INTERVENTIONS FOR STUDENTS IN NEED O TARGETED LITERACY SUPPORT. WITH THE CURRENT TEACHER SHORTAGE UP LIFTING NEW AND EXISTING TEACHER LEADERS IS IMPORTANT TO RAISING OUR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM. RESEARCH ALSO SHOWS THAT USE OF COACHES IS PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE IN IMPROVING TEACHER PRACTICE AND STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT. ESTABLISHING COACHING MODELS ARE IMPORTANT BECAUSE ONE TIME WORKSHOPS CAN BE EFFECTIVE IN TEACHERS AWARENESS OF LITERACY PRACTICE. BUT ARE INSUFFICIENT IF THE GOAL IS TO STAINED USE OF AN EVIDENCE BASED LITERACY PRACTICE. ALSO COACHING PROVIDES ONGOING AND SAID FOR TO. THAT ALLOWS TEACHERS TO PROTECT SKILLS IN THE- AND RECEIVE FEEDBACK FROM A COACH. IN ADDITION TO THE POSITIVE IMPACTS AND TEACHER INSTRUCTION RESEARCH HAS FOUND THAT LITERACY COACHING POSITIVELY INFLUENCES STUDENTS AND SPECIFICALLY ARE MULTI LINGUAL LEARNERS ACROSS. WELLS THE CAPILLARY AND SUBJECT AREA COMPREHENSION ARE INTEGRATED INTO THE ARTS. ARE THERE A POINT MAN CLASSROOM TEACHERS ARE FEELING THE STRAIN OF INSTRUCTION ACROSS THE PANDEMIC AND THE AWARENESS OF SOCIAL EMOTIONAL NEEDS OF STUDENTS AND ADULTS HEIGHTENED COACHES ARE EXPERIENCED EXPERT TEACHERS AND LITERACY. HOW CAN CAN THEN PROVIDE AN AVENUE FOR OUR CLASSROOM EDUCATORS ENTER TEACHER LEADERSHIP AND CONTINUE TO POSITIVELY INFLUENCE INSTRUCTION ACROSS SCHOOL CAMPUSES FOR DIRECT IMPACT TO STUDENTS. THIS OPPORTUNITY SUPPORTS THREE PART SHE AREAS ARE NOT. ONE TEACHERS WHO FEEL SUPPORTED. AND EMPOWERED BY ARE MORE LIKELY TO REMAIN ENGAGED IN THE PROFESSION IMPROVING THOSE SKILLS AND AFFECT. SECOND TEACHERS READY TO LEAVE THE PROFESSION MAY CHOOSE TO STAY IN EDUCATION AS A COACH KEEP IN THEIR VALUABLE KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE SUPPORTING EDUCATION. AND THIRD THE MENTORSHIP ASPECT OF COACHING CAN ALSO HELP ATTRACT NEW TEACHERS TO THE PROFESSION WITH A SUPPORTED SCAFFOLD TREAT THAT COINCIDES WITH THE EFFORTS TO CREATE A MORE EFFECTIVE TEACHER PIPELINE STABBER LITERACY NOW. WHICH CAN STEP LOW EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES IN THIS WORK AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO ALIGNING THIS INITIATIVE WITH OUR CURRENT LETTERS THREE PROJECTS TO INCREASE EXPANDS THE AND- MOVING TO THE MULTI WILL. PROPOSAL THIS IS IMPORTANT AS OUR INCREASE CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY DIVERSE STUDENTS AND COMMUNITIES CREATE A SIGNIFICANT NEED TO REFRESH SCHOOL LIBRARIES. MANY OF WHICH AVERAGE COPYRIGHT DATE OF TWENTY YEARS OLD OR OLDER AND ARE NOT REFLECTIVE OF TODAY'S DEMOGRAPHICS. POSTED WILL HELP ENSURE MULTI LINGUAL AND CULTURALLY RELEVANT TAX BECOME ACCESSIBLE TO CHILDREN IN PRE K. THROUGH THIRD GRADE VS SCHOOL AND CLASSROOM LIBRARIES PROMOTE LITERACY AND MULTIPLE LANGUAGES EQUITABLE REPRESENTATION OF DIVERSE CULTURAL AND LINGUISTIC EXPERIENCES AS PART OF LITERACY IN MULTI LITERACY DEVELOPMENT IN YOUNG CHILDREN WHEN THE BRAIN IS MOST RECEPTIVE TO THAT SPENDING LANGUAGE. THESE RESOURCES ARE OFTEN THE LEAST ACCESSIBLE AND HAVE CALIFORNIA CLASSROOMS DUE TO FACTORS SUCH AS HIGH COST. ACCESS TO THESE TAX WILL PUT WITHIN REACH CRITICAL LEARNING RESOURCES FOR EMERGENT MULTILINGUAL CHILDREN ENJOY LANGUAGE IMMERSION PROGRAMS WHERE THEY ARE LEARNING ACADEMICS AND DEVELOPING LANGUAGE IN BOTH ENGLISH AND A LANGUAGE OTHER THAN ENGLISH. THERE ARE CURRENTLY NEARLY FIFTEEN HUNDRED MULTI LINGUAL PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA WITH GROWING INTEREST IN EXPANDING NEEDS WE NEED MORE ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY LITERATURE AND MULTIPLE TAX. MULTILINGUAL CULTURALLY RELEVANT TAX BENEFIT LEARNERS AND OTHER WAYS FOR EXAMPLE SENIOR REPRESENTATION OF ONESELF IN TAX IS CULTURALLY AFFIRMING. THEIR HELPING SOCIAL WELL BEING WHICH IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT AT A TIME WHEN MENTAL WELLNESS IS A CRITICAL CONSIDERATION IN OUR SCHOOLS. FINALLY SUPPORTING MULTI LINGUAL LEARNERS DEVELOP STRONGER SKILLS IN THEIR HOME LANGUAGE IS ALSO AN EQUITY ISSUE THAT LEADS TO STRONGER ENGLISH LANGUAGE ACQUISITION RESEARCH THOSE AT LITERACY IN A HOME LANGUAGE AN ONGOING PRACTICE READING AND WRITING IN THAT LANGUAGE. CAN MOST READILY FACILITY ACQUISITION OF LITERACY AND ANY ADDITIONAL LANGUAGE SUCH AS ENGLISH AS MANY LITERACY SKILLS CAN BE TRANSFERRED ACROSS LANGUAGES. IN CLOSING THE DEPARTMENT GREATLY APPRECIATE THE INVESTMENT AND LITERACY COACHES MENTORS AND INTERVENTIONS FOR STUDENTS EAT UP LITERACY SUPPORT AND ARE HAPPY TO ALSO SEE THE INVESTMENT IN MULTI LINGUAL AND CULTURALLY RELEVANT SCHOOL. AND CLASSROOM LIBRARIES PROPOSED BY THE ADMINISTRATION. PROCESS MOVES FORWARD WE ARE MORE THAN HAPPY TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ON SPECIFIC POINTS RELATED TO THESE PROPOSALS.

SEVEN BOOKS IN THE HOME AND BEING TALKED READ THE SAME TO IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT FOR HER TO LANGUAGE LEARNERS.

READING ALSO WAS THE TYPE OF NO AND- THAT ARE BENEFICIAL BOTH CHILDREN AND ADULTS. AS WE KNOW ALL TOO WELL THE CODE NINETEEN AND THEN BECAUSE FRONT ISOLATION AND EXTREME STRESS CHOI CHILDREN FAMILIES. WE SERVE EARLY LITERACY AN AND STRETCH TO AMELIORATE THIS HELPING BOND.

I'M SORRY MR MEDINA IS NOT HERE TODAY BECAUSE HE'D BE REALLY EXCITED TO TALK ABOUT THE ISSUE OF CURRICULA. ESPECIALLY HOW IT RELATES TO- ETHNIC STUDIES. IMPLEMENTATION IN CALIFORNIA. WITH THAT ISSUE NUMBER FIVE WE HAVE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE L. A. O. DEPARTMENT OF IT. YES HELLO AGAIN MICHELLE LEGAL DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THE AGENDA PROVIDES AN OVERVIEW OF THE PROPOSAL SO I WILL GO INTO A BIT MORE DETAIL. I'M FOR THE PROPOSAL RELATED TO MODEL CURRICULA THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES FOURTEEN MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT TO SUPPORT THE COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION AND DEVELOPING THE FORMADA CURRICULA AS MANDATED BY STATUTE. SO THAT IS IT MEANS AMERICAN REFUGEE EXPERIENCE NOT A CURRICULUM THAT CAMBODIAN GENOCIDE MODEL CURRICULUM THE CURRICULUM ONLINE HISTORY CULTURAL STUDIES AND THE NATIVE AMERICAN STUDIES MODEL CURRICULUM. THIS FUNDING IS TO BUILD UPON THE ONE POINT TWO MILLION PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT THAT WAS PROVIDED IN THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET ACT FOR THE VARIOUS CURRICULA- WE ARE PROPOSING EVEN FOUR WAY SPLIT A FUNDING SO A TOTAL OF ABOUT. THREE POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS FOR EACH MODEL CURRICULUM WE SEE THIS AS BEING VERY REASONABLE GIVEN THE SIGNIFICANT WORK THAT WE ARE ASKING- COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION TO DO AND DEVELOPING THE CURRICULUM INCLUDING RESOURCES AND LESSON PLANS- AS WELL AS PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR THESE COMPLICATED SUBJECTS- AND THEN ALSO A PART OF THAT AGENDA. OUT FOR THE EXTRA INSTRUCTIONAL QUALITY COMMISSION THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES TWO HUNDRED FORTY SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS THIS INCLUDES A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND TO COMPLETE THE MATH CURRICULUM FRAMEWORK AND NINETY SIX THOUSAND FOR OVERALL I DO SEE CLASS- AND THAT CONCLUDES MY PRESENTATION MY COLLEAGUE AMBER ALEXANDER. IS ALSO ON THE LINE AND WE'LL BOTH AVAILABLE ANSWER QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE. TIME THANK YOU WITH THE L. A. AGAIN ON THE GOVERNOR'S FOURTEEN MILLION DOLLAR- MODEL CURRICULA PROPOSAL WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE COULD APPROVE A REDUCED FUNDING AMOUNT I NEED THIS CALCULATION OF FORTY MILLION WAS BASED ON A ASSED APPROPRIATIONS WHICH INCLUDED REGIONAL PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT- WHICH WOULD BE A MORE COSTLY ACTIVITY THANK CONTRAST THE MODEL CURRICULA ACTIVITIES WOULD NOT REQUIRE REGIONAL PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT BUT RATHER TO DEVELOPMENT OF TRAINING MATERIALS FOR THIS REASON WE THINK MODEL CURRICULA DEVELOPMENT COULD COST LESS THAN THE PROPOSED FOURTEEN MILLION. IN AN ALTERNATE ANALYSIS WE ESTIMATED THE TOTAL COST TO BE AROUND FIVE POINT FOUR MILLION OVER THREE YEARS IF THE LEGISLATURE IS INTERESTED IN APPROVING THE PROPOSED AMOUNT HOWEVER HOWEVER WE RECOMMEND ADDING A GREATER LEVEL OF LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT INCLUDING REQUIRING THE SELECTED SEELEY'S TO SUBMIT AN ANNUAL EXPENDITURE PLAN TO FINANCE AND THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE WORK SPECIFYING IN TRAILER LEGISLATION ANY ADDITIONAL EXPECTATIONS ON THE PROPOSED FINDING I CONCLUDE MY REMARKS BUT HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AT THE- TIME THANK YOU OKAY THANK. YOU DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR VERSUS COMMITTEE MY NAME IS CHERYL CAUGHT THAT HE- OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION CALIFORNIA.

AT THE CD WORKS CLOSELY WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION TO CREATE A STREAMLINED PROCESS CALLED A REQUEST FOR CONSIDERATION OR RFC. THIS PROCESS PROVIDED THE EFFICIENCY THAT WAS NECESSARY TO MEET THE TIGHT TIMELINES FOR ENTERING INTO THESE FOR CONTRACTS. THE PROCESS PROVIDED COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION THE OPPORTUNITY TO SUBMIT AND EXPLAIN THEIR PLAN TO INCLUDE STATEWIDE ENGAGEMENT OPPORTUNITIES. CURRICULUM EXPERTS THEY WOULD BRING INTO THE PROJECT AND THEIR PLANT TO DEVELOP THESE MODEL CURRICULA. WHEN REVIEWING THE R. F. C. SUBMISSION SPECIAL CONSIDERATION WAS GIVEN TO EACH OF THE COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION ABILITY AND BANDWIDTH TO FACILITATE THIS LEVEL OF ENGAGEMENT STATEWIDE. IMMEDIATELY AFTER PASSAGE OF AB ONE SIXTY SEVEN LAST FALL THE CD CONSULTED WITH THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION. AND BEGAN IMPLEMENTING THE RSC PROCESS IN OCTOBER AND BEGAN ACCEPTING SUBMISSIONS IN NOVEMBER. EVALUATIONS OF THE SUBMISSIONS TOOK PLACE THEN IN DECEMBER. THE ORANGE COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WAS SELECTED TO DEVELOP THE VIETNAMESE AMERICAN REFUGEE EXPERIENCE MODEL CURRICULUM. THE CAMBODIAN GENOCIDE MODEL CURRICULUM AND THE MODERN HISTORY AND CULTURAL STUDIES MODEL CURRICULUM. SINCE ORANGE COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WILL BE LEADING THESE THREE THEY ARE BEING ASKED TO SUBCONTRACT WITH THE SANTA CLARA COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION. TO ENSURE BROADSHEET. RADICAL REPRESENTATION. DO YOU COUNTY OFF OF A- WERE SELECT TO ENTER INTO CONTRACT TO DEVELOP A SINGLE NATIVE AMERICAN STUDIES MODEL CURRICULUM. KNOWS TO EDUCATION ARE HUMBOLDT COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION AND SAN DIEGO COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION. THE CITY IS CURRENTLY WORKING ON FINALIZING THE SCOPES OF WORK AND BUDGETS TO FINALIZE EACH OF THESE CONTRACTS. TO REVIEW AND VET THE WORK OF THE COUNTY OFFICES AND ENSURE SUFFICIENT COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND THEIR PROCESS IS. A STATEWIDE MODEL CURRICULUM COORDINATING COUNCIL WILL BE ESTABLISHED IN WEST ED WILL BE CONTRACTED TO CONVENE THIS GROUP. I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT TO ALSO UPDATE YOU ON THE PROGRESS OF THE ETHNIC STUDIES IMPLEMENTATION. THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET INCLUDED TWO SETS OF FUNDS FOR THE SUPPORT TO THIS EFFORT. THE FIRST IS FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO CONTRACT WITH THE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION OR CONSORTIUM OF COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION TO PROVIDE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND REGIONAL TRAINING FOR TEACHERS. ADMINISTRATORS AND PARA PROFESSIONALS TO SUPPORT CREATION OR EXPANSION OF ETHNIC STUDIES COURSE OFFERINGS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO FORCES THAT USE THE ETHNIC STUDIES MODEL CURRICULUM. FUNDS WILL ALSO BE USED TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO AN ONLINE REPOSITORY OF RESOURCES TO SUPPORT ETHNIC STUDIES COURSES. THIS INCLUDES THE COLLECTION AND REVIEW OF MATERIALS TO BE MADE AVAILABLE FOR EDUCATORS TO USE IN IMPLEMENTING THE ETHNIC STUDIES MODEL CURRICULUM. THE SECOND EFFORT WAS THE APPROPRIATION OF FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME FUNDS TO ELEAZAR TO SUPPORT THE CREATION OR EXPANSION OF ETHNIC STUDIES COURSE OFFERINGS. THE CD WILL POST L. A. ALLOCATIONS BY EARLY MARCH AN ELDERLY NEEDS WILL RECEIVE THESE FUNDS BY MID APRIL. I'M HAPPY. TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. OKAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR THAT TESTIMONY THE ONLY QUESTION I HAVE IS EITHER FOR. OR ANYBODY DEPARTMENT OF AT THAT L. A. OR OR- FINANCE. WE ARE VERY- EXCITED ABOUT LAST YEAR'S- LEGISLATIVE VICTORY. AND HAVING ETHNIC STUDIES AS A REQUIREMENT FOR ALL OF THE HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS ARE ONLY DISAPPOINTMENT IS THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE. TO THE END OF THE DECADE BEFORE IT'S REQUIREMENTS BUT- BY MID DECADE SCHOOLS WILL HAVE TO START REQUIRING IT. LAST YEAR WE DID PUT- MONEY IN THE BUDGET FIFTY ONE FIFTY MILLION ONE TIME. TO LAUNCH THIS WORK AND DO WE THINK. THAT THAT'S THE ADEQUATE AMOUNT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE A SUCCESSFUL. ETHNIC STUDIES- REQUIREMENT FOR HIGH SCHOOLS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. AMBER ALEXANDER WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO CLARIFY THAT IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ETHNIC STUDIES GRADUATION REQUIREMENT IS- CONTINGENT ON AN APPROPRIATION- TO DATE AND APPROPRIATIONS SPECIFIC TO THAT IMPLEMENTATION OF A GRADUATION REQUIREMENT HAS HAS NOT BEEN MADE THEY- THE FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT. I'M THAT ARE REFERENCED IN THE AGENDA AND THAT YOU REFERENCED IN YOUR COMMENT- AGAIN WAS ONE TIME FUNDING AND THAT FUNDING WAS SPECIFIC TO THE CREATION OR EXPANSION OF ETHNIC STUDIES. COURSES IT WAS NOT TIED TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE GRADUATION MANDATE ITSELF NOR DOES FINANCE BELIEVE THAT FIFTY MILLION WOULD BE SUFFICIENT SHOULD THAT MANDATE I'M PROGRESS. OKAY DEPARTMENT OF ED DO WE THINK I KNOW THAT WE HAVE SOME DEBATE ABOUT THAT AND I'M NOT SURE WHY YOU NEED. AND APPROPRIATION BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA HAVE THAT CLASS TAUGHT IN THE HIGH SCHOOL ANYWAY. YOU HAVE A TEACHER TEACHING THAT CLASS AS OPPOSED TO ANOTHER CLASS. AND STILL JUST YOU KNOW SIMPLE MATHEMATICS I DON'T QUITE GET IT BUT IN THE MEANTIME. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. DO WE THINK THAT WE NEED AND ANY OTHER RESOURCES- ON THE LEAD UP TO. THE ETHNIC STUDIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. THIS IS NOT MY TAURUS- SO YES YOU'RE YOU'RE RIGHT THAT IMPLEMENTING THE COURSES UNTIL ONE MORNING CURRENT- TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIXTEEN GRADUATION REQUIREMENT. AND DOESN'T TAKE EFFECT UNTIL THE TWENTY NINE THIRTY HI THIS SCHOOL YEAR- HEARING OUT FOR THIS REQUIREMENT IS LIKELY TO BE A MULTI YEAR PROCESS WITH COSTS- EXCEEDING. EXCEEDING FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR STATEWIDE FOR AT LEAST TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. OKAY. WE WILL HOLD THIS ISSUE OPEN AS WELL- NOTRE COMMITTEE MEMBERS ARE HERE RIGHT NOW TO ENGAGE- WITH US SO WITH THAT THAT THAT THE THAT'S THE CONCLUSION OF THE AGENDA AS ITEMS NOW WILL HAVE PUBLIC COMMENT. GIVE NO ONE HERE IN THE AUDIENCE- WE DO HAVE THE OPTION OF PEOPLE TO CALL IN AGAIN IF YOU ANOTHER NUMBER IT'S ON THE AGENDA IT'S. SEVEN SIX NINE TWO EIGHT NINE FIVE SEVEN. THE ACCESS CODE IS. ONE THREE ONE FIVE ONE TWO SIX THE ACCESS CODE IS ONE TREE ONE. FIFTY ONE TWENTY SIX. YES AND THIS KEEP YOUR COMMENTS TO SIXTY SECONDS OR LESS ONE MINUTE OR LESS. WOULD YOU HAVE ONE PERSON HERE IN PERSON GO AHEAD SIR. MARK ABSTAINED CALIFORNIAN FUNDAMENTAL TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION NETWORK- AS FAR AS ON THE CURRICULUM NEW CURRICULA LOCKED WHAT I HEAR FROM A LOT OF TEACHERS IS THAT THERE'S MORE OF ANY NOT SO MUCH FOR YOUR CURRICULUM. BUT HELP IN PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND AS FAR AS IN DELIVERY PARTICULARLY USING A MERGING DIGITAL TOOLS THE LAST MEETING THAT I WAS OUT FOR THIS COMMITTEE THAT THERE WAS A LOT OF DISCUSSION OF ENGAGEMENT AND- DEALING WITH ATTENDANCE. AND THERE'S BEEN SOME STUDIES AS FAR AS DEALING WITH HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS AND THEIR THEIR PERCEPTIONS.
