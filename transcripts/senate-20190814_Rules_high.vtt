00:07:44.363 --> 00:07:46.666
THE CHALLENGES THAT EVERYBODY

00:07:46.732 --> 00:07:47.266
AS WE SIT HERE TODAY BELIEVES

00:07:47.333 --> 00:07:49.936
IN CLASS CONSOLIDATION. EXCEPT

00:07:50.002 --> 00:07:50.870
WHEN YOU START TALKING ABOUT

00:07:50.937 --> 00:07:51.571
THE CLASSES AND THEIR

00:07:51.637 --> 00:07:53.206
DEPARTMENTS AND THEN A SORT OF

00:07:53.272 --> 00:07:54.240
LIKE WHEN YOU WALKING

00:07:54.307 --> 00:07:56.309
CONSOLIDATE BUT I WOULD

00:07:56.375 --> 00:07:56.909
ACTUALLY LIKE TO KEEP MY HOME

00:07:56.976 --> 00:07:59.612
AND SO WITH. IT BECOMES REALLY

00:07:59.679 --> 00:08:01.681
AS- A LEADERSHIP QUESTION AT

00:08:01.747 --> 00:08:03.549
HOUSE THE DEPARTMENT HAS HAVE

00:08:03.616 --> 00:08:05.418
TO GET ON BOARD AND EVERYBODY

00:08:05.484 --> 00:08:07.086
HAS TO BE ON BOARD WITH IT IF.

00:08:07.153 --> 00:08:09.088
THERE ARE CONSOLIDATIONS THE

00:08:09.155 --> 00:08:10.289
UNIONS GET AWAY AND EVERYBODY

00:08:10.356 --> 00:08:12.859
GETS TO WIN AND SO IF THE IF

00:08:12.925 --> 00:08:13.526
THE MESSAGE FROM ON HIGH IS

00:08:13.593 --> 00:08:17.563
THAT THIS IS WHAT WE ARE DOING.

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:18.164
THERE'S HOPE THAT WE WOULD BE

00:08:18.231 --> 00:08:20.399
ABLE TO GET THROUGH MORE. I

00:08:20.466 --> 00:08:21.400
CAN'T GIVE YOU A DATE. IS THAT

00:08:21.467 --> 00:08:22.735
THE MESSAGE THAT YOU WERE

00:08:22.802 --> 00:08:24.837
CONSISTENTLY HEARING FROM ON

00:08:24.904 --> 00:08:25.471
HIGH THAT IN FACT WE NEED TO DO

00:08:25.538 --> 00:08:28.374
THIS. YES NO I MEAN I THINK

00:08:28.441 --> 00:08:30.009
EVERYBODY WANTS TO DO IT AND I

00:08:30.076 --> 00:08:31.077
THINK THAT IF WE ASK MOST

00:08:31.143 --> 00:08:32.478
DEPARTMENT HAS THEY WOULD ALSO

00:08:32.545 --> 00:08:34.113
AGREE THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:34.747
CLASS CONSOLIDATION BUT WHAT WE

00:08:34.814 --> 00:08:37.316
HAVE FOUND IN PRACTICE. IS THAT

00:08:37.383 --> 00:08:38.451
DEPARTMENTS ARE A LITTLE MORE

00:08:38.517 --> 00:08:40.186
RELUCTANT TO. TO GIVE UP THEIR

00:08:40.253 --> 00:08:41.387
OWN CLASSIFICATIONS IN THE

00:08:41.454 --> 00:08:42.755
EXAMPLE I USED EARLIER TODAY

00:08:42.822 --> 00:08:44.357
WAS THAT OF A TURNS THEIR

00:08:44.423 --> 00:08:44.924
ATTORNEYS AND MANY DIFFERENT

00:08:44.991 --> 00:08:47.593
DEPARTMENTS. AND SO IF YOU HAVE

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:48.794
ONE ATTORNEY CLASSIFICATION YOU

00:08:48.861 --> 00:08:51.030
COULD APPLY FOR THE DEPARTMENT

00:08:51.097 --> 00:08:51.564
OF LABOR FOR THE ATTORNEY

00:08:51.631 --> 00:08:53.666
GENERAL'S OFFICE WHAT HAVE YOU.

00:08:53.733 --> 00:08:55.001
BUT DEPARTMENT SAY WHAT I

00:08:55.067 --> 00:08:56.269
ACTUALLY NEED MY OWN ATTORNEY

00:08:56.335 --> 00:08:58.004
CLASSIFICATION YOU WALK AND

00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:00.006
HAVE ONE FOR YOU BUT I REALLY A

00:09:00.072 --> 00:09:02.875
SPECIAL ONE FOR ME BECAUSE IT

00:09:02.942 --> 00:09:06.112
WOULD HELP EMPLOYEES. NO WHICH

00:09:06.178 --> 00:09:06.946
DEPARTMENT THEY WERE APPLY FOR

00:09:07.013 --> 00:09:08.881
IN THAT THE COUNTER ARGUMENT IS

00:09:08.948 --> 00:09:10.116
THEN YOU APPLY TO THAT

00:09:10.182 --> 00:09:12.618
DEPARTMENT YOU. PASS THE TEST

00:09:12.685 --> 00:09:13.519
AND IF YOU WANT TO BE IN

00:09:13.586 --> 00:09:14.854
ATTORNEY GENERAL YOU APPLY FOR

00:09:14.921 --> 00:09:15.821
THAT DEPARTMENT IF YOU WANT TO

00:09:15.888 --> 00:09:16.389
WORK FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:09:16.455 --> 00:09:18.557
LABOR YOU DO THAT BUT THERE IS.

00:09:18.624 --> 00:09:19.825
THERE DEFINITELY ARE CHALLENGES

00:09:19.892 --> 00:09:21.560
WHERE DEPARTMENTS FEEL LITTLE

00:09:21.627 --> 00:09:22.295
PROTECTIVE OF THEIR OWN

00:09:22.361 --> 00:09:23.829
CLASSIFICATIONS EVEN THOUGH

00:09:23.896 --> 00:09:26.999
GLOBALLY THEY SUPPORT THE IDEA.

00:09:27.066 --> 00:09:28.200
SO IT IS IT'S A CHALLENGE AND I

00:09:28.267 --> 00:09:31.604
THINK IT COMES THE DECISIONS.

00:09:31.671 --> 00:09:32.872
THE IMPETUS IS GONNA HAVE TO

00:09:32.939 --> 00:09:35.007
COME FROM LEADERSHIP WE START

00:09:35.074 --> 00:09:36.375
MAKING THOSE. WELL I FOUND. I

00:09:36.442 --> 00:09:36.943
CERTAINLY AGREE AND IF IT IS

00:09:37.009 --> 00:09:40.613
TRUE THAT. THE COMPLEXITY OF

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:41.847
OUR PAYROLL SYSTEM AND

00:09:41.914 --> 00:09:44.050
CLASSIFICATIONS IN MO USE

00:09:44.116 --> 00:09:46.452
CLASSIFICATIONS OF SEVERAL A

00:09:46.519 --> 00:09:47.687
CONTRIBUTES TO SOME OF OUR

00:09:47.753 --> 00:09:49.722
DIFFICULTY IN FIELDING NEW IT

00:09:49.789 --> 00:09:51.123
SYSTEMS PARTICULARLY IN THE HR

00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:52.558
AND PAYROLL AREA WE'RE GOING TO

00:09:52.625 --> 00:09:54.994
HAVE TO WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GET

00:09:55.061 --> 00:09:55.594
A HANDLE ON THAT AND I COMMEND

00:09:55.661 --> 00:09:57.496

CERTAINLY LOOK FORWARD TO AN

00:10:02.234 --> 00:10:03.502

CONGRATULATIONS AND LOOKING OUT

00:10:41.407 --> 00:10:43.642
TO THE YEARS THAT YOU'VE SERVED

00:10:43.709 --> 00:10:46.212
THIS BURDEN AT VERY SIGNIFICANT

00:10:46.278 --> 00:10:48.314
HERE THE INSTITUTIONAL SHINDO

00:10:48.381 --> 00:10:50.116
CERTAINLY THAT IS SO VERY

00:10:50.182 --> 00:10:51.550
IMPORTANT IN THE WORK THAT

00:10:51.617 --> 00:10:52.651
YOU'RE DOING ON YOU KNOW IT'S

00:10:52.718 --> 00:10:54.687
NOT HOW WE USED TO DO IT IS HOW

00:10:54.754 --> 00:10:56.589
WE'VE IMPROVED FROM I THINK

00:10:56.655 --> 00:10:57.990
IT'S TWENTY TWELVE IS THAT

00:10:58.057 --> 00:11:00.493
CORRECT YES BACK FANTASTIC SO

00:11:00.559 --> 00:11:02.228
MY QUESTION WOULD PROBABLY BE

00:11:02.294 --> 00:11:04.330
JUST THAT PERSPECTIVE YOU CAME

00:11:04.397 --> 00:11:05.164
IN TWENTY TWELVE ALONG PRETTY

00:11:05.231 --> 00:11:07.400
YOUNG. WHILE YOU KNOW NOT TOO

00:11:07.466 --> 00:11:11.504
LONG. OUT OF COLLEGE AND YOU

00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:16.709
SEEN THOUGH YOU'RE VERY KIND.

00:11:16.776 --> 00:11:17.309
ONE WOMAN WE CARE ABOUT THOSE

00:11:17.376 --> 00:11:19.278
THINGS RIGHT AS LONG AS- BUTI

00:11:19.345 --> 00:11:20.179
THINK THAT IT WOULD BE GOOD TO

00:11:20.246 --> 00:11:21.580
JUST GET A QUICK PERSPECTIVE ON

00:11:21.647 --> 00:11:22.581
THE AGENCY NOW OUT WITH A LOT

00:11:22.648 --> 00:11:24.150
OF THE NEW REGULATIONS THAT

00:11:24.216 --> 00:11:25.484
HAVE COME FORWARD FOR LABOR

00:11:25.551 --> 00:11:27.253
ALSO SEXUAL HARASSMENT ALL OF

00:11:27.319 --> 00:11:30.222
THAT. HOW D YOU SEE ON YOUR

00:11:30.289 --> 00:11:32.525
THE AGENCY OR YOUR ASSIGNMENT

00:11:32.591 --> 00:11:34.260
TO KIND OF FROM TWENTY TWELVE

00:11:34.326 --> 00:11:36.328
TO THE PRESENT BEING BETTER IN

00:11:36.395 --> 00:11:37.763
TERMS REPRESENTING CERTAINLY

00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:41.300
THE PEOPLE. AND THE EMPLOYEES

00:11:41.367 --> 00:11:44.670
AND THE WHOLE SYSTEM. SO I'D

00:11:44.737 --> 00:11:45.471
ONE OF THE CHANGES IS WHEN I

00:11:45.538 --> 00:11:45.971
FIRST CAME IT WAS AT THE

00:11:46.038 --> 00:11:48.541
BEGINNING OF THE. THE

00:11:48.607 --> 00:11:51.377
REORGANIZATION THAT LET S. P.

00:11:51.444 --> 00:11:53.546
B. AND CAL H. ARE OFTEN TO TWO

00:11:53.612 --> 00:11:54.113
DIFFERENT APARTMENTS AND SO

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:58.384
THAT YOU HAVE STARTED I THINK

00:11:58.451 --> 00:11:59.985
RIGHT BEFORE I CAME ON AND SO

00:12:00.052 --> 00:12:02.688
SORT OF SEEING HOW THOSE

00:12:02.755 --> 00:12:03.289
ENTITIES ARE BECOMING SEPARATE

00:12:03.355 --> 00:12:04.790
AND YET. REALLY QUITE

00:12:04.857 --> 00:12:09.628
INTERTWINED. SO THERE IS A

00:12:09.695 --> 00:12:11.630
LITTLE BIT MORE CLARITY ABOUT

00:12:11.697 --> 00:12:12.198
THE RULES NOW THAN THEY WERE

00:12:12.264 --> 00:12:14.767
BECAUSE IT WAS SORT OF THAT. IT

00:12:14.834 --> 00:12:16.769
WAS THAT A WORK IN PROGRESS AND

00:12:16.836 --> 00:12:17.369
THERE WAS REALLY NO BLUEPRINT

00:12:17.436 --> 00:12:17.970
BECAUSE IT HADN'T BEEN DONE

00:12:18.037 --> 00:12:20.406
BEFORE WHAT WHAT I HAVE SEEN IN

00:12:20.473 --> 00:12:21.540
TERMS OF THE ABOUT INDEPENDENT

00:12:21.607 --> 00:12:23.209
BEST OCCASIONS THAT THE

00:12:23.275 --> 00:12:24.977
DEPARTMENT IS DOING INTO

00:12:25.044 --> 00:12:26.679
DEPARTMENTS EVERY THREE YEARS

00:12:26.745 --> 00:12:28.681
THAT'S NEW AND I THINK THAT

00:12:28.747 --> 00:12:29.315
THAT'S HELPFUL IT WILL HELP US

00:12:29.381 --> 00:12:32.585
IDENTIFY TRENDS. GOOD AND BAD

00:12:32.651 --> 00:12:35.421
HELP US IDENTIFY I'M FROM THE

00:12:35.488 --> 00:12:37.056
BEST PRACTICES IN DEPARTMENTS

00:12:37.123 --> 00:12:39.558
AND ALSO WITH ONGOING TRAININGS

00:12:39.625 --> 00:12:41.460
THAT NEED TO BE DONE LIKE

00:12:41.527 --> 00:12:42.394
SEXUAL HARASSMENT AS YOU

00:12:42.461 --> 00:12:46.031
MENTIONED. AND HELPING TO MAKE

00:12:46.098 --> 00:12:48.200
SURE I MEAN WHAT WE ARE IS THE

00:12:48.267 --> 00:12:49.468
ENTITY TO SORT OF SHINE A

00:12:49.535 --> 00:12:51.070
BRIGHT LIGHT WHEN SOMETHING

00:12:51.137 --> 00:12:52.938
GOES POORLY IT IS AS I WAS

00:12:53.005 --> 00:12:54.206
SAYING EARLY SORT OF UP TO THE

00:12:54.273 --> 00:12:55.808
LEADERSHIP TO SAY. YOU NEED TO

00:12:55.875 --> 00:12:59.378
DO THIS BUT AS HAS HAPPENED

00:12:59.445 --> 00:13:04.116
WITH THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION.

00:13:04.183 --> 00:13:06.185
A BRIGHT LIGHT WAS SHOWN AND-

00:13:06.252 --> 00:13:07.553
SO CHANGES WERE MADE TO THE WAY

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:08.154
THAT THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:09.555
FRANKLY DOES BUSINESS NOW AND I

00:13:09.622 --> 00:13:10.556
THINK THAT THAT CERTAINLY

00:13:10.623 --> 00:13:12.391
WASN'T. EXCLUSIVELY BECAUSE OF

00:13:12.458 --> 00:13:14.593
S. P. B. BUT THE INVESTIGATION

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:16.562
THAT THE HARD WORKING. STAFF

00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:19.031
MEMBERS AT THAT AGENCY DID WAS

00:13:19.098 --> 00:13:19.598
WAS CERTAINLY A BIG PART OF

00:13:19.665 --> 00:13:22.134
THAT AND- WE WOULD HOPE WOULD

00:13:22.201 --> 00:13:27.706
GIVE OTHER AGENCIES ENGAGING IN.

00:13:27.773 --> 00:13:29.508
DUBIOUS PRACTICES A LITTLE BIT

00:13:29.575 --> 00:13:32.645
OF PAUSE WOULD NOT WANT TO BE

00:13:32.711 --> 00:13:33.779
SORT OF SEE THEIR NAMES IN THE

00:13:33.846 --> 00:13:34.847
HEADLINES ARE BE BROUGHT BEFORE

00:13:34.914 --> 00:13:36.815
THE SNOW INVITED TO EXPLAIN

00:13:36.882 --> 00:13:37.850
THEMSELVES TO THE BOARD AND SO

00:13:37.917 --> 00:13:39.885
I THINK THAT THAT IS IF

00:13:39.952 --> 00:13:41.387
SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN WORKING

00:13:41.453 --> 00:13:43.722
OUT WELL FOR US. THANK YOU FOR

APPRECIATED THEM AS WE

00:14:12.818 --> 00:14:15.421
DISCUSSED BRIEFLY AND I THINK

00:14:15.487 --> 00:14:16.055
WOULD BE OF INTEREST TO MEMBERS

00:14:16.121 --> 00:14:17.823
OF THE- OF THE RULES COMMITTEE.

00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:22.995

PERSONNEL BOARD IN TWENTY

00:14:25.097 --> 00:14:26.098
EIGHTEEN IT WAS DETERMINED THAT

00:14:26.165 --> 00:14:28.767
NEARLY 60% OF AGENCIES DID NOT

00:14:28.834 --> 00:14:29.301
PROVIDE SEXUAL HARASSMENT

00:14:29.368 --> 00:14:37.176
TRAINING. IN THAT SINCE TWENTY

00:14:37.243 --> 00:14:37.743
SIXTEEN THE STATE PERSONAL

00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:40.346
BOARD HAS IDENTIFIED EIGHTEEN

00:14:40.412 --> 00:14:40.879
HUNDRED STATE GOVERNMENT

YOU HAVE ANY AUTHORITY TO MOVE

00:14:56.028 --> 00:14:57.396
THEM INTO ACTION IT SEEMS LIKE

00:14:57.463 --> 00:15:00.232
THIS IS NOT A VERY ENCOURAGING.

00:15:00.299 --> 00:15:02.201
COMPLAINTS THE DATA OF DOING

00:15:02.268 --> 00:15:06.538
TRAINING THAT COULD BOTH

00:15:06.605 --> 00:15:07.539
PROTECT EMPLOYEES FROM UNWANTED

00:15:07.606 --> 00:15:10.075
HARASSMENT LAWS TO PROTECT THE

00:15:10.142 --> 00:15:13.112
STATE FROM POTENTIAL LIABILITY.

00:15:13.178 --> 00:15:14.513
WE'RE SORT OF LIKE I DON'T KNOW

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:15.714
WHAT THE CHANNELS HERE IN SAN

FRANCISCO WE HAVE SEVEN ON YOUR

00:15:17.249 --> 00:15:18.450
SIDE IT'S LIKE INVESTIGATIVE

00:15:18.517 --> 00:15:20.552
JOURNALISM AND THEY GO IN AND

00:15:20.619 --> 00:15:23.589
SO IF YOUR DEPARTMENT HAS FIFTY

00:15:23.656 --> 00:15:25.257
PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT GONE

00:15:25.324 --> 00:15:26.558
THROUGH THE TRAINING AND YOU

00:15:26.625 --> 00:15:27.293
KNOW THAT YOUR DEPARTMENT IS

00:15:27.359 --> 00:15:28.394
SUPPOSED TO GO THROUGH THE

00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:31.864
TRAINING. WE EXPOSE THAT WE

00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:33.666

HELP US UNDERSTAND WHY YOU

00:15:37.236 --> 00:15:38.971
DIDN'T FEEL WAS A PRIORITY FOR

00:15:39.038 --> 00:15:42.574
YOUR EMPLOYEES TO COMPLY WITH

00:15:42.641 --> 00:15:43.309
THE LINE WITH THOSE MANDATED

00:15:43.375 --> 00:15:45.844
TRAINING DIRECTIVES. AT THE END

00:15:45.911 --> 00:15:49.748
OF THE DAY IF IT WERE. IF THE

00:15:49.815 --> 00:15:50.282
ISSUE WERE SUCH THAT THE

00:15:50.349 --> 00:15:52.051
GOVERNOR THOUGHT IT WARRANTED

00:15:52.117 --> 00:15:54.219
THAT THE GOVERNOR COULD REPLACE

00:15:54.286 --> 00:15:56.355
THE DEPARTMENT HEAD OR-

00:15:56.422 --> 00:15:57.823
MANAGERS COULD BE REPLACED BY

00:15:57.890 --> 00:15:59.258
THEIR DEPARTMENT. HANG ON WHAT

00:15:59.325 --> 00:16:02.461
THE ISSUE IS OUR JOB IS REALLY

00:16:02.528 --> 00:16:06.365
TO EXPOSE THAT AND TO. MAKE

00:16:06.432 --> 00:16:07.633
SURE THAT EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:09.201
THERE ND THAT THEY NEED TO DO

00:16:09.268 --> 00:16:10.703
IT BUT TO EXPOSE ANYTHING THAT

00:16:10.769 --> 00:16:11.904
DOES NOT HAPPEN. WELL I

00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:15.274
APPRECIATE THAT AND I THINK. IT

00:16:15.341 --> 00:16:16.875
IT LEAST PROVIDES A STARTING

00:16:16.942 --> 00:16:19.078
POINT THE- ACTION NEEDS TO BE

00:16:19.144 --> 00:16:20.346
TAKEN WHETHER THAT'S BY THE

00:16:20.412 --> 00:16:22.815
LEGISLATURE OR- OTHER STATE

00:16:22.881 --> 00:16:23.349
AGENCIES IN THE GOVERNOR'S

00:16:23.415 --> 00:16:26.952
OFFICE. THIS JUST SEEMS

00:16:27.019 --> 00:16:29.888
UNACCEPTABLE IN OUR- CURRENT

00:16:29.955 --> 00:16:31.423

DON'T TELL YOU WHAT WHAT I

00:23:21.399 --> 00:23:22.601
DIDN'T PAY WHEN I WAS THERE.

00:23:22.667 --> 00:23:26.805
BUT IT'S THE FINEST INSTITUTE

00:23:26.872 --> 00:23:28.507
PUBLIC UNIVERSITY SYSTEM IN THE

00:23:28.573 --> 00:23:30.709
WORLD ONE OF THINGS WE DID

00:23:30.776 --> 00:23:31.309

00:23:37.215 --> 00:23:38.917
BALANCE BETWEEN PROTECTING

00:23:38.984 --> 00:23:40.118
FIRST AMENDMENT FREE SPEECH

00:23:40.185 --> 00:23:43.188
RIGHTS ANA AND PROTECTING THE

FACULTY AND STAFF HAD A WE-

00:23:47.058 --> 00:23:51.563
ENDEAVOR TO PRESERVE THE RIGHT

00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:53.298
BUT PROTECT THE SAFETY AND

00:23:53.365 --> 00:23:56.301
SECURITY THANK YOU CENTER AS WE

00:23:56.368 --> 00:23:58.370
SPOKE ABOUT I DID MEET WITH THE

00:23:58.436 --> 00:24:00.438
A DL ONE OF THE FIRST MEETINGS

00:24:00.505 --> 00:24:01.072
I TOOK AS A REGION WAS WITH THE

00:24:01.139 --> 00:24:03.708
ANTI DEFAMATION LEAGUE. MY

00:24:03.775 --> 00:24:06.278
MOTHER WAS A EXPERIENCE

00:24:06.344 --> 00:24:06.878
EXTRAORDINARY ANTI SEMITISM IN

00:24:06.945 --> 00:24:11.883
HER YOUTH. I THINK IT'S PRETTY

00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:14.085
CLEAR ON ONE HAND WE HAVE HATE

00:24:14.152 --> 00:24:15.520
SPEECH AND ON THE OTHER SIDE WE

00:24:15.587 --> 00:24:18.190
HAVE FREE SPEECH AND I THINK

00:24:18.256 --> 00:24:19.658
THE JOB OF REGION'S IS TO FIND

00:24:19.724 --> 00:24:21.593
THE MIDDLE LINE WHERE EVEN

00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:24.029
UNPOPULAR VOICES CAN BE HEARD

00:24:24.095 --> 00:24:26.998
AND ALLOWED TO SPEAK BUT TO THE

00:24:27.065 --> 00:24:28.700
POINT WHERE SOMEONE'S LIFE IS

00:24:28.767 --> 00:24:30.969
IN DANGER OR ITS INCITING

00:24:31.036 --> 00:24:33.405
VIOLENCE I'M JUST NEVER GOING

00:24:33.471 --> 00:24:34.406
TO ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN UNDER

00:24:34.472 --> 00:24:36.608
MY WATCH I THINK IT'S VERY

00:24:36.675 --> 00:24:37.876
CLEAR SOME PEOPLE LIKE TO SAY

00:24:37.943 --> 00:24:38.944
THAT THAT MIDDLE LINE IS

00:24:39.010 --> 00:24:41.046
DIFFICULT TO FIND. I DON'T

00:24:41.112 --> 00:24:42.914
THINK SO I THINK HATE SPEECH IS

00:24:42.981 --> 00:24:48.687
HATE SPEECH IT HAS. ZERO CLICKS.

00:24:48.753 --> 00:24:49.321
THERE'S NO PLACE ON THE CAMPUS

00:24:49.387 --> 00:24:49.955
OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA

00:24:50.021 --> 00:24:52.924
AND- ON THE OTHER HAND I DO

00:24:52.991 --> 00:24:55.093
WANNA AS UNPOPULAR AS IT IS TO

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:55.627
HEAR SOME SPEAKERS AT THE

00:24:55.694 --> 00:24:58.663
UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA. I THINK

00:24:58.730 --> 00:24:59.164
WE HAVE TO GIVEN THAT

00:24:59.231 --> 00:25:00.465
OPPORTUNITY I THINK THAT'S

00:25:00.532 --> 00:25:02.200
THEIR RIGHT BUT THEY JUST

00:25:02.267 --> 00:25:03.235
CANNOT INCITE VIOLENCE AND

00:25:03.301 --> 00:25:04.769
THAT'S HOW I DRAW THE LINE.

00:25:04.836 --> 00:25:07.706
THANK YOU ANOTHER AREA THAT WE

00:25:07.772 --> 00:25:10.842
DID TOUCH ON TO IS. LOOKING AT.

00:25:10.909 --> 00:25:12.010
RELATIVE ENROLLMENT FIGURES TO

00:25:12.077 --> 00:25:15.413
VARIOUS. MINORITY POPULATIONS

00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:16.448
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN

00:25:16.514 --> 00:25:18.383
THE RELATIVELY LOW ON

00:25:18.450 --> 00:25:20.018
ENROLLMENT RATES FOR AFRICAN

00:25:20.085 --> 00:25:20.552
AMERICANS YOU SHARED SOME

00:25:20.619 --> 00:25:23.822
THOUGHT SON. HELLO HELLO WE CAN

00:25:23.889 --> 00:25:25.991
REMEDY NOT ONLY ACCESS BUT

00:25:26.057 --> 00:25:29.394
RETENTION. SOME OF THEM MAY BE

00:25:29.461 --> 00:25:31.796
INTERNAL REFORMS NECESSARY TO

00:25:31.863 --> 00:25:32.364
CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT THAT'S

00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:36.001
CONDUCIVE TO. REFLECTING THE

00:25:36.067 --> 00:25:38.503
DIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA YES

00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:42.407
AFRICAN AMERICAN. ENROLLMENT IS

00:25:42.474 --> 00:25:44.442
LOW I DON'T CARE WHAT ANYBODY

00:25:44.509 --> 00:25:46.044
SAYS EVEN THOUGH IT'S GOING UP

00:25:46.111 --> 00:25:48.046
IT'S ONLY A FOUR FOUR AND A

00:25:48.113 --> 00:25:50.048
HALF PERCENT IT'S UP FROM SIX

00:25:50.115 --> 00:25:51.750
YEARS AGO BUT IT SHOULD BE UP

00:25:51.816 --> 00:25:54.352
HIGHER I THINK THERE'S MANY

00:25:54.419 --> 00:25:56.755
ISSUES AT PLAY HERE I THINK WE

00:25:56.821 --> 00:25:58.256
NEED TO REALLY DEVELOP SOME OF

00:25:58.323 --> 00:25:59.858
THE SUMMER PROGRAM SO HIGH

00:25:59.925 --> 00:26:01.059
SCHOOL STUDENTS CAN COME TO THE

00:26:01.126 --> 00:26:02.827
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. AND

00:26:02.894 --> 00:26:04.362
UNDERSTAND WHAT IT MEANS TO GO

00:26:04.429 --> 00:26:06.031
TO COLLEGE SO IT'S NOT SUCH A

00:26:06.097 --> 00:26:07.299
SCARY THINGS THAT THEY FEEL

00:26:07.365 --> 00:26:09.100
SAFER THERE I THINK WE NEED TO

00:26:09.167 --> 00:26:11.536
HAVE MORE MENTORSHIP ON CAMPUS

00:26:11.603 --> 00:26:12.137
AND WHEN I MEAN MENTORSHIP NOT

00:26:12.203 --> 00:26:14.472
JUST STUDENT MENTORSHIP. WE

00:26:14.539 --> 00:26:15.140
HAVE TO GROW OUR AFRICAN

00:26:15.206 --> 00:26:17.275
AMERICAN FACULTY AND STAFF SO

00:26:17.342 --> 00:26:19.044
THAT FACULTY AND STAFF CAN.

00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:20.879
MENTOR STUDENTS THAT'S HOW THEY

00:26:20.946 --> 00:26:21.413
FEEL SAFE IN AN UNFAMILIAR

00:26:21.479 --> 00:26:26.351
ENVIRONMENT. IT'S OBVIOUS

00:26:26.418 --> 00:26:27.919
FINANCIAL AID IS AN ISSUE WITH

00:26:27.986 --> 00:26:31.289
WE HAVE A TRUCK TREMENDOUS.

00:26:31.356 --> 00:26:32.424
COMPETITION ISSUES WITH SOME OF

00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:34.759
THE PRIVATE UNIVERSITIES AND I

00:26:34.826 --> 00:26:35.961
THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIND

00:26:36.027 --> 00:26:36.494
WAYS AROUND THAT THAT IT'S

00:26:36.561 --> 00:26:40.398
TRICKY. AND THE LAST THING IS

00:26:40.465 --> 00:26:42.767
YOU KNOW THE UNIVERSITY OF

00:26:42.834 --> 00:26:43.335
CALIFORNIA HAS OUTRAGE ABOUT

00:26:43.401 --> 00:26:45.804
FOUR HUNDRED HIGH SCHOOLS. FOR

00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:47.872
COLLEGE PREP AND TO REALLY

00:26:47.939 --> 00:26:49.808
EDUCATE STUDENTS ON WHAT IT IS

00:26:49.874 --> 00:26:50.375
LIKE TO BE AT THE UNIVERSITY

00:26:50.442 --> 00:26:52.610
CALIFORNIA THAT'S A GOOD NUMBER.

00:26:52.677 --> 00:26:54.446
I DON'T KNOW HOW HOW PRODUCTIVE

00:26:54.512 --> 00:26:55.480
IT IS NOT SOMETHING I WANT TO

00:26:55.547 --> 00:26:56.781
LOOK INTO I MIGHT. COME BACK TO

00:26:56.848 --> 00:26:59.551

00:26:59.617 --> 00:27:00.185
HUNDRED SCHOOLS BUT LET'S DO IT

00:27:00.251 --> 00:27:03.154
WELL. AND THAT'S SOMETHING

00:27:03.221 --> 00:27:05.256
WE'RE DIGGING INTO AN WHICH IS

00:27:05.323 --> 00:27:05.824
THAT WAS SOMETHING WE SPOKE

00:27:05.890 --> 00:27:08.126
ABOUT IN OUR LAST MEETING.

00:27:08.193 --> 00:27:10.362

FOR ACTUALLY STEPPING FORWARD

00:27:33.852 --> 00:27:35.487
INTO A VERY VERY CHALLENGING

00:27:35.553 --> 00:27:37.188
POSITION ESPECIALLY AT THIS

00:27:37.255 --> 00:27:38.323
TIME AND I THINK IN OUR

00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:40.291
UNIVERSITY SYSTEM BOTH PUBLIC

00:27:40.358 --> 00:27:41.826
AND PRIVATE WE HAD A GREAT

00:27:41.893 --> 00:27:43.728
MEETING HE WAS ON THE HOT SEAT

00:27:43.795 --> 00:27:45.030
YOU GUYS BUT AFTER THE

00:27:45.096 --> 00:27:47.832
QUESTIONS I FELT LIKE I WAS SO

00:27:47.899 --> 00:27:49.100
WE HAD A REALLY GOOD EXCHANGE

00:27:49.167 --> 00:27:52.237
AND I THINK WE FOUND. THE WITH

00:27:52.303 --> 00:27:54.105
MOST MY BIGGEST CONCERN IS TO

00:27:54.172 --> 00:27:56.074
BE IN HERE AS YOU MAY ALL KNOW

00:27:56.141 --> 00:27:57.175
AND CERTAINLY WITH THE UC

00:27:57.242 --> 00:27:59.511
SYSTEM IS THE GROWTH OF WHAT I

00:27:59.577 --> 00:28:00.945
CONSIDER TO BE THE BUREAUCRACY

00:28:01.012 --> 00:28:02.447
I DO BELIEVE THAT IT IMPAIRS

00:28:02.514 --> 00:28:03.882
THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE

00:28:03.948 --> 00:28:06.284
VISION OF THE LEGISLATORS WHO

00:28:06.351 --> 00:28:07.952
SET THE RULES IN THE RANKS THAT

00:28:08.019 --> 00:28:10.455
MASS RESPOND TO THE PEOPLE WE

00:28:10.522 --> 00:28:12.557
COME HERE TO SERVE IN HERE AND

00:28:12.624 --> 00:28:14.292
YOU SEE ARE WE SEE A GROWTH OF

00:28:14.359 --> 00:28:15.860
ADMINISTRATION OVER. THE TEN

00:28:15.927 --> 00:28:17.929
YEAR JOB PROFESSORS AND WHAT I

00:28:17.996 --> 00:28:20.532
CONSIDER ACADEMIA THE STAFF AND

00:28:20.598 --> 00:28:21.566
WE HAD A CONVERSATION ABOUT

00:28:21.633 --> 00:28:22.834
THAT AND I DID MENTION I'D LIKE

00:28:22.901 --> 00:28:24.536
YOU TO SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON

00:28:24.602 --> 00:28:26.037
THAT AND WHAT THE REGION'S

00:28:26.104 --> 00:28:28.740
MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO TO

00:28:28.807 --> 00:28:30.875
BASICALLY KIND OF RAIN INDIANA

00:28:30.942 --> 00:28:31.810
AND BRING SOME BALANCE BACK YES

00:28:31.876 --> 00:28:36.181
THANK YOU CENTER. BATES THE

00:28:36.247 --> 00:28:40.819
BUREAUCRACY IS FRUSTRATING. YOU

00:28:40.885 --> 00:28:41.953
ALL ARE INVOLVED IN GOVERNMENT

00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:42.520
ON A DAILY BASIS I'M IN THE

00:28:42.587 --> 00:28:44.089
PRIVATE SECTOR WE DO THINGS

00:28:44.155 --> 00:28:45.423
DIFFERENTLY I THINK WHEN I LOOK

00:28:45.490 --> 00:28:45.990
AT THE BUREAUCRACY THERE ARE

00:28:46.057 --> 00:28:46.624
MOMENTS WHEN I WANT TO LOSE MY

00:28:46.691 --> 00:28:50.929
HAIR. AND I THINK WHAT WE HAVE

00:28:50.995 --> 00:28:53.264
DONE AND I GIVE CREDIT SAID

00:28:53.331 --> 00:28:57.268
GAVIN TO GOVERNOR BROWN INTO.

00:28:57.335 --> 00:28:58.336
GOVERNOR NEWSOME YOU DO NEED

00:28:58.403 --> 00:28:59.971
SOME PEOPLE COMING OUT OF

00:29:00.038 --> 00:29:01.906
PRIVATE PRACTICE ON THE BOARD

00:29:01.973 --> 00:29:02.507
OF REGENTS THAT CAN GIVE THAT

00:29:02.574 --> 00:29:05.844
LEVEL OF EXPERTISE. WHOEVER

00:29:05.910 --> 00:29:07.245
SAID THAT THIS WAS A RUBBER

00:29:07.312 --> 00:29:08.546
STAMP BOARD I DON'T MAYBE IT

00:29:08.613 --> 00:29:10.415
WAS THREE YEARS AGO. IT'S NOT

00:29:10.482 --> 00:29:11.983
NOW AS I'VE TOLD A NUMBER OF

00:29:12.050 --> 00:29:14.486
YOU IN PRIVATE SESSION WE GO

00:29:14.552 --> 00:29:16.121
OUT WITH ONE ANOTHER THERE ARE

00:29:16.187 --> 00:29:17.388
VERY DIFFERENT POINTS OF VIEW

00:29:17.455 --> 00:29:19.591
ON THAT BOARD. BUREAUCRACY IS A

00:29:19.657 --> 00:29:21.826
BIG ISSUE I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT

00:29:21.893 --> 00:29:22.694
WHEN WE LOOK AT THE OFFICE OF

00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:24.262
THE PRESIDENT. WHERE SOME OF

00:29:24.329 --> 00:29:25.396
THE BUREAUCRACY HAS

00:29:25.463 --> 00:29:27.365
HISTORICALLY BEEN WE ARE GOING

00:29:27.432 --> 00:29:29.868
LINE BY LINE ON THAT BUDGET AND

00:29:29.934 --> 00:29:32.036
SAYING IS THIS NECESSARY. DO WE

00:29:32.103 --> 00:29:34.839
NEED IT AND IS IT WORTH IT. AND

00:29:34.906 --> 00:29:35.473
WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO DO THAT

00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:37.442
I THINK THAT. IT TAKES TIME AS

00:29:37.509 --> 00:29:40.712
A NEWLY APPOINTED REGION. IT

00:29:40.778 --> 00:29:42.614
TAKES TIME TO UNDERSTAND WHERE

00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:44.082
THE BUREAUCRACY IS AND WHAT'S

00:29:44.149 --> 00:29:45.850
WORKING WELL AND THE ONLY THING

00:29:45.917 --> 00:29:47.418
I CAN DO IS LOOK AT YOU IN THE

00:29:47.485 --> 00:29:48.019
EYE AND SAY I'M GONNA DIG DEEP

00:29:48.086 --> 00:29:51.956
INTO THAT. AND TO MAKE SURE

00:29:52.023 --> 00:29:52.490
THAT WERE RUNNING THE MOST

00:29:52.557 --> 00:29:53.024
EFFICIENT ORGANIZATION WE

00:29:53.091 --> 00:29:55.493
POSSIBLY CAN. AND I AM SURE

00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:57.529

00:29:57.595 --> 00:29:58.997

COMMITMENT TO INNOVATION I MEAN

00:30:14.245 --> 00:30:15.446
I THINK THAT'S WHAT SETS

00:30:15.513 --> 00:30:17.148
CALIFORNIA APART FROM THE REST

00:30:17.215 --> 00:30:18.416

RAN TAKEN STATION OF MINE IN

00:30:45.944 --> 00:30:47.812
THE ANNALS VALLEY. HAS A

00:30:47.879 --> 00:30:48.980
DAUGHTER EXCELLENT ACADEMICALLY

00:30:49.047 --> 00:30:52.717
FOUR POINT WHATEVER. A LIFELONG

00:30:52.784 --> 00:30:54.886
DREAM YET TO BERKELEY DID I GET

00:30:54.953 --> 00:30:55.353
INTO BERKELEY GOT INTO

00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:57.055
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN. HER

00:30:57.121 --> 00:31:00.858
COUSIN WHO LIVES IN MICHIGAN.

00:31:00.925 --> 00:31:04.862
GUIDED TO BERKELEY AND. SO

00:31:04.929 --> 00:31:06.731
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM I UNDERSTAND

00:31:06.798 --> 00:31:07.932
THE NEED TO HAVE OUT OF STATE

00:31:07.999 --> 00:31:10.134
AND IN THEIR SAW A CULTURAL

00:31:10.201 --> 00:31:11.336
ENRICHMENT ASPECT AS WELL SO

00:31:11.402 --> 00:31:12.337
BUT WAS SO WHAT DO YOU WHAT

00:31:12.403 --> 00:31:14.305
YOUR VIEW IN TERMS OF PROPER

00:31:14.372 --> 00:31:17.242
PROPER MIX THERE WE HAVE A MIX

00:31:17.308 --> 00:31:19.611
RIGHT NOW IT'S A IT'S AT 18% I

00:31:19.677 --> 00:31:20.945
MEAN FOR CERTAIN SCHOOLS IT'S

00:31:21.012 --> 00:31:22.981
GONE UP. I THINK THERE IS AN

00:31:23.047 --> 00:31:24.882
ASPECT OF DIVERSITY FROM OUT OF

00:31:24.949 --> 00:31:26.451
STATE OUT OF COUNTRY I THINK

00:31:26.517 --> 00:31:27.552
SOMETIMES PEOPLE REFER TO ADD A

00:31:27.619 --> 00:31:31.823
STATE BUT I THINK IN THAT IN

00:31:31.889 --> 00:31:32.423
THAT CATEGORY OUT OF COUNTRIES

00:31:32.490 --> 00:31:36.327
A PORTION OF IT. I BELIEVE WE

00:31:36.394 --> 00:31:36.894
SHOULD HAVE THE DIVERSITY OF

00:31:36.961 --> 00:31:37.562
OUT OF STATE NOT A COUNTRY I

00:31:37.629 --> 00:31:41.833
ALSO. WE HAVE TO BE HONEST WITH

00:31:41.899 --> 00:31:43.001
ONE ANOTHER AND SAY THAT OUT OF

00:31:43.067 --> 00:31:44.969
STATE STUDENTS TO HELP SUPPORT

00:31:45.036 --> 00:31:46.838
IN STATE STUDENTS THEIR TUITION

00:31:46.904 --> 00:31:48.006
DOES AND I THINK THAT'S

00:31:48.072 --> 00:31:50.408
VALUABLE BUT I THINK WE HAVE TO

00:31:50.475 --> 00:31:54.145
WALK THE FINE LINE. WE SOME OF

00:31:54.212 --> 00:31:55.346
THE SCHOOLS HAVE EXCEEDED THEIR

00:31:55.413 --> 00:31:58.216
CAP. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT

00:31:58.283 --> 00:31:59.951
HAPPENS WHEN THAT HAPPENS.

00:32:00.018 --> 00:32:03.087
CURRENTLY IF THE US FAM. SCHOOL

00:32:03.154 --> 00:32:04.756
EXCEEDS THEIR CAP OF OUT OF

00:32:04.822 --> 00:32:06.991
STATE THE ACCESS FUNDS THE

00:32:07.058 --> 00:32:08.393
DIFFERENTIAL GOES BACK TO THE

00:32:08.459 --> 00:32:09.894
OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT THAT

00:32:09.961 --> 00:32:11.396
THEN CAN BE USED FOR OTHER

00:32:11.462 --> 00:32:12.630
SCHOOLS I THINK THAT'S-

00:32:12.697 --> 00:32:15.500
REASONABLE. AND I THINK THAT WE

00:32:15.566 --> 00:32:17.135
JUST AS A BORDER GOING TO HAVE

00:32:17.201 --> 00:32:18.369
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE RIGHT

00:32:18.436 --> 00:32:20.371
NUMBER AS A LOT OF THAT IS

00:32:20.438 --> 00:32:22.840
GOING TO BE BUDGETARY BASED AND

00:32:22.907 --> 00:32:24.709
I THINK AS ALL OF US ALL

00:32:24.776 --> 00:32:26.611
REGIONS HAVE THE OBLIGATION. I

00:32:26.678 --> 00:32:28.146
THINK WE SIT HERE BEFORE YOU

00:32:28.212 --> 00:32:29.714
AND SAY OUR JOB IS TO MAKE SURE

00:32:29.781 --> 00:32:31.082
THAT THE UNIVERSITY OF

00:32:31.149 --> 00:32:32.984
CALIFORNIA EDUCATES THE MOST

00:32:33.051 --> 00:32:35.520
NUMBER OF CALIFORNIANS QUALIFY

00:32:35.586 --> 00:32:37.388
CALIFORNIANS POSSIBLE AND

00:32:37.455 --> 00:32:38.589
THAT'S WHAT I'M COMMITTED TO

00:32:38.656 --> 00:32:41.592
DO. BREAK SO A SOFA SO OF A

00:32:41.659 --> 00:32:42.760
FOLLOW UP ON THAT SEE RECENTLY

00:32:42.827 --> 00:32:44.562
VOTED TO INCREASE TUITION ON

00:32:44.629 --> 00:32:45.797
OUT OF STATE OUT OF COUNTRY

00:32:45.863 --> 00:32:49.500
STUDENTS WHAT FACTORS WOULD YOU

00:32:49.567 --> 00:32:52.270
CONSIDER MAKING ASSESSMENT IF

00:32:52.337 --> 00:32:54.005
WE NEEDED TO RAISE TUITION FOR

00:32:54.072 --> 00:32:56.474
IN STATE STUDENTS. HI VOTED ON

00:32:56.541 --> 00:32:58.443
THAT MEASURE WAS A SEVEN

00:32:58.509 --> 00:32:59.544
HUNDRED AND SIXTY EIGHT DOLLAR

00:32:59.610 --> 00:33:01.446
INCREASE FOR OUT OF STATE

00:33:01.512 --> 00:33:01.979
STUDENTS THAT HADN'T BEEN

00:33:02.046 --> 00:33:03.081
RAISED IN SOMETIME. AND WANT TO

00:33:03.147 --> 00:33:05.750
DO IT IT WOULD HAVE LED TO A

00:33:05.817 --> 00:33:06.317
TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR

00:33:06.384 --> 00:33:08.553
SHORTFALL AND NO ONE HAD A GOOD

00:33:08.619 --> 00:33:12.523
ANSWER OF HOW THAT WAS GONNA

00:33:12.590 --> 00:33:13.124
MAY BE MADE UP SO THAT'S WHY I

00:33:13.191 --> 00:33:18.329
VOTED FOR. UP IN STATE. WE TALK

00:33:18.396 --> 00:33:18.930
ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME IT'S THE

00:33:18.996 --> 00:33:19.697
MOST TALKED ABOUT QUESTIONS AND

00:33:19.764 --> 00:33:20.498
THE BOARD OF REGENTS IS ABOUT

00:33:20.565 --> 00:33:21.265
RAISING TUITION ON IN STATE IN.

00:33:21.332 --> 00:33:23.334
A STUDENTS. I THINK IT WILL BE

00:33:23.401 --> 00:33:24.802
THE LAST THING ANY OF US WILL

00:33:24.869 --> 00:33:25.970
WANT TO DO. I THINK THAT THERE

00:33:26.037 --> 00:33:29.807
WILL BE. CONTROLLING THERE WILL

00:33:29.874 --> 00:33:32.043
BE MOVING MONIES AROUND

00:33:32.110 --> 00:33:32.610
ANYTHING POSSIBLE TO PREVENT

00:33:32.677 --> 00:33:35.646
THAT FROM HAPPENING. INEVITABLY

00:33:35.713 --> 00:33:38.750
THOUGH IT WILL HAPPEN. AND I

00:33:38.816 --> 00:33:39.350
THINK IT'S JUST GONNA REQUIRE

00:33:39.417 --> 00:33:43.654
LEADERSHIP. I AM INCREDIBLY

00:33:43.721 --> 00:33:45.022
IMPRESSED BY YOUR FORMER

00:33:45.089 --> 00:33:46.057
COLLEAGUE JOHN FOR AS HIS OUR

00:33:46.124 --> 00:33:49.327
NEW CHAIRMAN ON HIS GRASP OF

00:33:49.394 --> 00:33:51.095
THIS MATTER AND I THINK WE'RE

00:33:51.162 --> 00:33:51.896
GONNA BE LOOKING TO THE

00:33:51.963 --> 00:33:53.131
LEADERSHIP OF A COUPLE OF

00:33:53.197 --> 00:33:53.731
REGION'S WHO HAVE BEEN AROUND

00:33:53.798 --> 00:33:56.601
THE BLOCK HERE. ANNA TO FIGURE

00:33:56.667 --> 00:33:58.035
OUT HOW WE DON'T DO THAT AND

00:33:58.102 --> 00:33:59.437
HOW WE CAN KEEP IT AFFORDABLE

00:33:59.504 --> 00:34:03.207
IT'S EXPENSIVE. BUT IT'S STILL

00:34:03.274 --> 00:34:05.810
A GOOD DEAL IN COMPARISON TO

00:34:05.877 --> 00:34:06.944
OTHER PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES AND

00:34:07.011 --> 00:34:07.545
CERTAINLY PRIVATE UNIVERSITIES

00:34:07.612 --> 00:34:10.314
AROUND THE COUNTRY. BUT LET ME

00:34:10.381 --> 00:34:12.116
JUST SAY ONE LAST THING I DON'T

00:34:12.183 --> 00:34:13.084
WANT TO RAISE TUITION IS THE

00:34:13.151 --> 00:34:15.420
LAST THE LAST THING I WANT TO

00:34:15.486 --> 00:34:17.855

00:34:17.922 --> 00:34:18.923

TÁI. WHICH WAS AS ABOUT AS

00:34:29.467 --> 00:34:29.934
OFFENSIVE AS YOU THINK YOU

00:34:30.001 --> 00:34:34.238
COULD SAY TO ME. SO WE WERE

00:34:34.305 --> 00:34:35.606
JUST SAID ALL ALL ALL DEAL WITH

00:34:35.673 --> 00:34:37.241

00:35:26.357 --> 00:35:27.758
RUBBER STAMP BOARD AND I'M

00:35:27.825 --> 00:35:29.560
PRETTY CLEAR I'VE SEEN THE

00:35:29.627 --> 00:35:30.428
APPOINTMENTS THAT GOVERNOR

00:35:30.495 --> 00:35:33.531
BROWN MADE. IN THE LAST SEVERAL

00:35:33.598 --> 00:35:35.867
YEARS IN AN ATTEMPT TO ADDRESS

00:35:35.933 --> 00:35:37.134
KIND OF AN ENVIRONMENT AND

00:35:37.201 --> 00:35:38.970
ATMOSPHERE ON THE BOARD. I

00:35:39.036 --> 00:35:40.371
WANTED TO ASK FROM YOUR

00:35:40.438 --> 00:35:42.507
PERSPECTIVE BECAUSE- I ACTUALLY

00:35:42.573 --> 00:35:44.008
SERVED ON THE BOARD OF REGENTS

00:35:44.075 --> 00:35:45.476
WHEN I WAS SPEAKER FOR A PERIOD

00:35:45.543 --> 00:35:48.579
OF TIME. AND I ALWAYS FELT THAT

00:35:48.646 --> 00:35:50.214
THE ENVIRONMENT WAS NOT VERY

00:35:50.281 --> 00:35:51.816
INVITING FOR PEOPLE WHO CAME TO

AGREE WITH YOU IT IS VERY COLD

00:36:15.072 --> 00:36:16.641
PEOPLE GIVEN ONE MINUTE TO

00:36:16.707 --> 00:36:20.778
SPEAK. A BUZZER GOES OFF. IT'S

00:36:20.845 --> 00:36:22.547
UNFORTUNATE WE'RE NOT ALLOWED

00:36:22.613 --> 00:36:24.916
TO RESPOND TO THE QUESTIONS AT

00:36:24.982 --> 00:36:26.717
THAT MOMENT ALTHOUGH. OUR

00:36:26.784 --> 00:36:28.653
SECRETARY DOES TAKE NOTES WE

00:36:28.719 --> 00:36:31.155
GET A- A BRIEFING MATERIAL.

PACKET AFTERWARDS WHERE WE CAN

00:36:32.590 --> 00:36:35.993
RESPOND TO THE INDIVIDUAL.

00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:37.361
CONSTITUENTS TO COME UP AND GET

00:36:37.428 --> 00:36:39.764
PUBLIC COMMENT BUT I AGREE WITH

00:36:39.830 --> 00:36:40.698
YOU I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE

00:36:40.765 --> 00:36:42.900
BEST WAY TO DO IT YOU KNOW WE

00:36:42.967 --> 00:36:43.935
HAVE HAD SECURITY ISSUES THERE

00:36:44.001 --> 00:36:46.470
SO THERE'S- MANAGEMENT OF

00:36:46.537 --> 00:36:48.406
SECURITY ISSUES I GIVE IT TO

00:36:48.472 --> 00:36:50.074
CHAIR PEREZ WHO. I THOUGHT

00:36:50.141 --> 00:36:51.208
THERE WAS OVER SECURITY FOR A

00:36:51.275 --> 00:36:53.744
PERIOD OF TIME AND THE NEW

00:36:53.811 --> 00:36:54.879
SHARE HAS REDUCED THE AMOUNT OF

00:36:54.946 --> 00:36:56.547
SECURITY THERE I THINK. THE

00:36:56.614 --> 00:36:58.449
SHEER VOLUME OF POLICE OFFICERS

00:36:58.516 --> 00:37:00.017
THERE MAKES IT VERY UNINVITING

00:37:00.084 --> 00:37:02.019
WHEN YOUR A STUDENT TO GO

00:37:02.086 --> 00:37:04.322

00:37:04.388 --> 00:37:06.090
