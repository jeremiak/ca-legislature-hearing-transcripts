AND THEN OPEN IT UP TO THE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO PROVIDE ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS. FOR THE BOARD OF VOCATIONAL NURSING AND PSYCHIATRIC TECHNICIANS. JOINING US TODAY ARE PRIMARY AS PRIMARILY PRIMARY WITNESSES ARE ELAINE YAMAGUCHI EXECUTIVE OFFICER. AND DR CAROL MOUNTAIN BOARD PRESIDENT. WITH THAT SAID LET'S TURN IT OVER. TO YOU PLEASE FEEL FREE TO PRESENT WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO PRESENT THE WORK AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE BBMP T. OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS. BECAUSE OF THE CURRENT PANDEMIC SITUATION I HAVE TO SAY THAT THIS PAST YEAR HAS BEEN LIKE NO OTHER. ANYONE WHO WORKS IN HEALTH CARE OR EDUCATION HAS HAD TO RE EXAMINE THE WAY IN WHICH WE WORK AND ARE EXPECTED OUTCOMES. ALTHOUGH THE PAST YEAR BROUGHT CHALLENGES NO ONE EXPECTED THE BORDERS CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON THREE IMPORTANT AREAS. CONSUMER PROTECTION. AGAINST CONSTITUENTS SUPPORT AND COLLABORATION. THESE THREE CORNERSTONES PROVIDE THE BASIS FOR THE WORK THAT HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED THUS FAR AND THE CONTINUING EFFORTS FROM THE B. B. AND P. T. I'D LIKE TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO WALK THROUGH EACH OF THESE AREAS TO DEMONSTRATE WHAT THE BOARD IS ALREADY ACCOMPLISHED. WHAT IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING ON AND HOW DID SPEAKS WITH ITS LONG TERM GOALS. THE FIRST CATEGORY CONSUMER PROTECTION HAS BEEN HIGHLIGHTED BY THE REBUILDING OF THE ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM MANAGEMENT. ESTABLISHING AN INTO AND IN SCREENING UNIT. AND FILLING THE VACANCIES IN THIS DIVISION. MOST RECENTLY THE BOARD AGREED TO SEND SIXTY BACKLOG CASES TO THE AG'S OFFICE. THAT PUBLIC PROTECTION AND CONSUMER NEED WERE OF HIGHEST PRIORITY IS TO ENSURE THAT THE CASES WILL BE HEARD IN A TIMELY MANNER AND THOSE NEEDING REVIEW FROM THE FULL BOARD WILL STILL BE PROCESSED. THE BOARD HAS IDENTIFIED THE ASPECTS OF CONSTITUENTS SUPPORT THEY CAN ASSIST IN CREATING BETTER RELATIONSHIPS WITH ITS MEMBERS AND STAKEHOLDERS. UNDER THE BOARD IS WORKING ON HIS TO CONSIDER CHANGING THE TITLE OF THE PSYCHIATRIC TECHNICIAN. NO ONE IS SURE WHAT THIS MEANS ANYMORE AS A TERM ORIGINATED WHEN THE STATE RUN PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITALS WERE MUCH MORE PROLIFIC IT IS A TITLE THAT HAS LONG BEEN CONSIDERED OUTDATED. BBMP T. HAS ALSO INCREASED ITS CONSUMER RESPONSIVENESS BY THE FOLLOWING ACTIONS. THE DECREASE OF PROCESSING TIME FOR KIDS EVEN THOUGH THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF THE IN APPLICATIONS. ASSISTING TIME WENT FROM APPROXIMATELY FIVE POINT FIVE WEEKS IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO APPROXIMATELY ONE POINT TWO FIVE WEEKS IN TWENTY TWENTY. THE DECREASE IN THE WAIT TIME FOR INCOMING CALLS IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WENT FROM THIRTY SIX MINUTES TO APPROXIMATELY FIVE MINUTES IN TWENTY TWENTY. SOME OF THIS HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED AS THE OPEN POSITIONS AT THE BBMP G. HAVE BEEN BILL MAKING THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE SERVICE TO THE PUBLIC ON CONSTITUENTS FUNCTION MORE SMOOTHLY. THE THIRD CORNERSTONE IS COLLABORATION. THIS COLLABORATION INCLUDES INTERNAL WORK BETWEEN THE BOARD AND THE BBMP TEAM WITH ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS AND WITH OUR INDUSTRY PARTNERS. THE CURRENT WORK AT THE RESTAURANT THERAPY BOARD TO CREATE REGULATIONS REGARDING THE MANAGEMENT OF VENTILATED PATIENTS REACHES ACROSS ALL THREE OF THESE FROM THE BBMP T. ITSELF. ACADEMIC PARTNERS TO INDUSTRY TO CREATE THE SAFEST ENVIRONMENT FOR PATIENTS. AND THE BEST POSSIBLE OUTCOMES. THE BBMP TEAM IS WORKING CLOSELY WITH OTHER INDUSTRY PARTNERS TO CONSIDER SCOPE OF PRACTICE ISSUES. INCLUDING THE BEAUTIFICATION MARKET TELEHEALTH AND ITS PLACE IN NURSING EDUCATION AND PROVIDING OF NURSING EDUCATION USING NONTRADITIONAL METHODS FOR EDUCATING ME AND STUDENTS. THE BOARD CONTINUES TO WORK ON OTHER SPECIFIC DEFICITS INCLUDING SCHOOL APPROVAL TIMES SCOPE OF PRACTICE ISSUES AND RESOLVE OUR OUTSTANDING DISCIPLINARY ISSUES. THIS BOARD HAS A COMMITMENT TO CONSUMER SAFETY AND THE WELFARE OF PATIENTS THEIR COLLEGIAL AND RESPECTFUL TO EACH OTHER AND THOSE WITH WHOM THEY INTERFACE. IT IS THE INTENT OF THE BOARD TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE CONSUMER THE CONSTITUENTS AND THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO WORKED CLOSELY TO DEVELOP DEVELOP AND CREATE HEALTH CARE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL. COMMENTS IN YOUR OPENING REMARKS FROM THE BOARD. K. Z. S. C. NONE OF THEM OF. IN THE CONVERSATION BACK TO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE IF THERE ARE ANY INITIAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS AT THIS TIME. WE CAN OF- DOCTOR PAN FOLLOWED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR. I THINK THE REMOTE AND- APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATION I DID HAVE A QUESTION- REGARDING- S. THAT CONTINUING EDUCATION- WELL IT'S A- IN THE OF THE SUBSCRIPTION- WASN'T CLEAR AS TO HOW YOU MONITOR IF SOMEONE'S TAKING THE CONTINUING EDUCATION THEY NEED- I UNDERSTAND FROM THE REPORT BACK IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THAT YES THERE'S AN EFFORT AUDIT EVERYONE AND WHICH WAS NOT. PARTICULARLY SUCCESSFUL ARE WS SOSOMEWHAT PROBLEMATIC BUT CERTAINLY OTHER BOARDS DO WHAT THEY DO THEY AUDIT CERTAIN PORTION OF THE LICENSEES EVERY CYCLE. AS WAY TO MONITOR SO- SO CAN YOU SPEAK TO THAT AND THEN I THINK THIS SPORT ALSO DOES PLAY A ROLE AND APPROVING C. AS WELL. AND SO IF YOU CAN SPEAK TO THE TYPES OF STANDARDS ARE WHAT DO YOU YOU KNOW IT TO ENSURE THAT THE C E. IS A OF SUFFICIENT QUALITY MOST SPECIFICALLY- DO YOU HAVE A CONFLICT OF INTEREST POLICY AND THIS IS SOMETHING I'VE ASKED EVERY BOARD THAT MIGHT THAT THE PROCEED TO ENSURE THAT. ANY CONTINUE EDUCATION DAY THE BOARD DOES APPROVE IS TRULY CONTINUING EDUCATION IS NOT A MARKETING OPPORTUNITY TO SELL PARTICULAR PRODUCT OR SERVICE- TO THE LICENSEES ARE THE PATIENTS THEY TAKE CARE OF SO. THAT THERE'S A SUFFICIENT COMMON INTEREST POLICY- THAT CAN BE APPLIED TO- TO SEE THAT'S APPROVED BY THE BOARD TO ENSURE THAT- THERE ARE. CONFLICTS BETWEEN A PERSON WHO'S TEACHING AT AND- AND FOR PATIENT SELF KEY ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES REGARDING. CONTINUE EDUCATION THANK YOU. I'D TO DEFER THAT IS DUMB GOOD SHE- OFFICER. THANK DR MOUNTAIN THANK YOU SO UNDERSTAND- AFTER THE C. ON IT UNDER PER MAN- THE BOARD KIND OF TOOK A PAUSE AND RESEARCHED AND ANALYZED WHAT AN APPROPRIATE C. AUDIT PROGRAM WOULD LOOK LIKE WE LAUNCH THAT PROGRAM WHICH WE THOUGHT WAS VERY SUSTAINABLE AND STILL. GOT THE RESULTS WE WERE LOOKING FOR IT SELECTED ABOUT TWO AND A HALF PERCENT. OF OUR RENEWING POPULATION ON IT THAT WAS ABOUT ELEVEN HUNDRED LICENSEES OVER THE COURSE OF. THE ALMOST YEAR THAT WE WERE ABLE TO AUDIT- ONLY ABOUT FIFTY CITATIONS WERE ISSUED FOR NON COMPLIANCE WHICH WE THOUGHT WAS WAS REMARKABLY GOOD- WE OF COURSE PAUSE OUR AUDIT FOR DURING THE PANDEMIC- WE LOOK FORWARD TO. RESUMING IT pEXPIRES SO WE'RE GOING TO ALLOW THE LICENSEES TO CATCH UP ON THEIR COMPLIANCE. NOW TO YOUR OTHER POINT SIR- I. ACTUALLY I'M NOT A 100% CERTAIN HOW TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION I'M PRETTY CONFIDENT THAT WE DON'T- WE DON'T REQUIRE THAT COMPETITION POLICY- WE SHOULD BE IN TERMS OF THE WAY THAT THESE ARE MONITORED OR REGULATED ARE ANY CZ EVALUATE VIA THE PROPOSED C. PROVIDERS AND MAKE CERTAIN THAT WHAT THEY'RE ASKING TO EDUCATE ON FITS INTO THE SCOPE OF PRACTICE STANDS. THE VARIOUS OTHER- PROFESSIONAL FIELDS BUT- I AM AWARE THAT SOME. ENTITIES LIKE THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE IMPLEMENTED SPECIFIC REGULATIONS TO DEVELOP THAT KIND OF. A PROBATION- SO WE WILL BE HAPPY TO LOOK INTO THAT M. WE MAY BE ABLE TO REPLY MORE FULLY- LATER BUT WILL CERTAINLY PROVIDE SOME COMMENT- IN IN A REPLY TO THE COMMITTEE WITH THE BACKGROUND PAPER. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT- REPLY- I WOULD THINK NO DATA I'M SURE THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE KNOW THAT I ACTUALLY ASK THIS OF PRACTICALLY EVERY BOARD THAT HAS C. E. AND SOME DO AND SOME DOWN. SO I HOPE PERHAPS- THE ANSWER TO PARTS OF PART OF THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION MAYBE IS THAT WE SHOULD HAVE THE DEPARTMENT CONSIDER. MAYBE DRAFTING SOME MODEL CONTINUING L. CONSEQUENCES POLICY REGARDING CONTINUING EDUCATION THAT. THAT THAT DON'T HAVE EXISTING POLICIES CAN ALWAYS MODEL THERE'S AFTER SO THAT- OF EVERY BOARD ISN'T TRYING TO START FROM SCRATCH IT'S MAINLY TO BE SURE THAT THERE'S DISCLOSURE. OF YOU KNOW FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE IS THAT SOMEONE HAS IF THEY'RE PROVIDING A EDUCATION COURSE OF- WHAT WHAT- YOU KNOW WHAT THE CONFLICTS MIGHT BE IF THEY'RE BEING PAID BY CERTAIN TYPES OF ENTITIES THAT MIGHT HAVE A PARTICULAR INTEREST AND OF COURSE- FIVE SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF. THAT FEATURE THAT THEIR- OKAY. WITHOUT GOING TO HOLD THE TOLERATE YOUR COMMITTEE- I THINK THERE ARE SOME OPPORTUNITIES TO LOOK INTO THAT SO I APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU SO MUCH. ROOM THANK YOU FOR CONSISTENCY DR PAN. SOME OF THE FLOOR. THANK YOU TO THE CHAIRS AND I JUST HAD A COUPLE QUESTIONS KIND OF ON THE PROCESS OF GETTING CERTIFIED FROM THE SCHOOLS PERSPECTIVE. I'M IS THERE ANYTHING IN. IN LAW WITH THE TIMELINE THE BENCHMARK OR ANY IDEA THAT THE SCHOOLS IN THE ASSURANCES THAT THE SCHOOLS CAN HAVE. ON A PROCESS AND A TIME LINE TO GET CERTIFIED- THROUGH THE BOARD. IS THERE ANYTHING LIKE THAT. IN WRITING. ONCE AGAIN AS YAMAGUCHI WOULD YOU LIKE TO DRESS UP PLEASE. THANK YOU TALK ABOUT- AT THIS POINT IN TIME THERE IS NOTHING IN OUR CODE REYES THAT LAYS OUT. A SPECIFIC TIME FRAME A SPECIFIC GUARANTEED FOR. A PROCESS FOR THE SCHOOLS TO BECOME- CERTIFIED TO APPROVE RATHER TO- BEGIN ACCEPTING STUDENTS- THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN LOOKING INTO FOR A LONG TIME- BUT IN THE INTEREST OF BREVITY ONE OF MY PAUSE THERE. BECAUSE I SENSE THAT THERE MAY BE A FOLLOW UP QUESTION. NORTH I THINK YOU WERE ON THE RIGHT TRACK THERE BUT I DO HAVE A FOLLOW UP QUESTION. SO WE DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE LIKE A TIME LINE AND I THINK IN IN THE WORLD OF CODE THAT WE LIVE IN AND CERTAINLY PRIOR TO COVERT EVEN IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WHEN IT COMES TO THAT ARE. COMMUNITIES WHERE ACCESS IS A TREMENDOUS ISSUE- WE HAVE THESE SCHOOLS THAT ARE READY AND WILLING TO TAKE. STUDENTS TO GET THEM TRAINED UP TO MOVE FORWARD. AND IT SEEMS LIKE THEY WERE THE LANE FOR SOME SORT OF REASON. AND IF SO IT'S GOOD THAT YOU'RE WORKING ON THAT BUT I AM CURIOUS LIKE WHAT ARE YOU WORKING ON IT IS IT A- FINANCIAL THING IS OF THE STAFFING THING LIKE WHAT IS THE HOLD UP. ON GETTING OUR STUDENTS ABLE TO BE TAUGHT IN THESE PARTICULAR INSTITUTIONS. IT'S ACTUALLY ALL THE ABOVE SIR- ONE OF THE PRINCIPLE. WE WILL CALL A BARRIER TO. CRUEL BUT ONE OF THE LARGEST FACTORS INVOLVED IN THE APPROVAL PROCESS IS THE CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT- THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY INTRICATE PROCESS- AS YOU KNOW YOU MAY KNOW THAT- CALIFORNIA BOTH OF US IN THE BRN. OUR CURRICULUM AND REQUIREMENTS. IT IS QUITE A BIT MORE STRINGENT M. AND LARGER THAN MOST OF THE OTHER STATES- THIS IS OLD AND AGAIN I WILL. CERTAINLY ADMIT THAT IT TAKES A LONG TIME I THINK GENERALLY SPEAKING- FROM THE TIME OF A SCHOOL PROGRAM. SENDS A LETTER OF INTENT TO THE TIME THAT IS ACTUALLY ACCEPTING STUDENTS IS WELL IN EXCESS OF TWO YEARS AND I REALIZE THAT THAT IS NOT- GOOD- RIGHT NOW I THINK THE- THERE IS THE STAFFING ISSUES THAT- ALREADY SEES WE HAVE SIX ANY SEASON ONE SUPERVISING. NEC AND THEIR WORK IS SPLIT UP AMONG THE WORK WITH A LOT AT THE ACTIVE SCHOOLS- WHICH LAST YEAR WAS A VERY VERY LARGE WORKLOAD. AND THEN ALSO TAKING ON- I THINK THREE OR FOR EACH OF THE OTHER PROGRAMS ON PROPOSAL LIST IT TAKES A WHILE BECAUSE THE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION THAT. THEY NEED TO IT AND ADELINE AND WORK WITH THAT PROPOSING PROGRAM IS ENORMOUS AND VERY DENSE VERY VERY COMPLEX AND THERE'S A NUMBER OF LOCAL FACTORS ACADEMIC FACTORS. SO IT'S NOT A PERFECT SYSTEM SO ONE OF THE FACTORS WE DID DO WHEN YOU MENTION THIS OF COURSE AS WELL IS THAT THERE IS A FINANCIAL ISSUE- ONE B. SOURCE LESS. WE HAVE THE BOOK THE UNDERSTANDING THE THEORY AT LEAST THAT SCHOOL PROPOSED PROGRAMS. AND REALLY AS A PLACE HLDER AND WERE THEY REQUIRED TO PROVIDE THE UPFRONT PROCESS YOU FEEL LIKE WE ARE AND DOES. IT MAKE A- DELAY THEM FROM PUTTING THEIR NAMES INTO THE ON THE LIST UNTIL THEY'RE MUCH FURTHER ALONG BUT ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK WE WANT TO LOOK AT AND THE BOARD AND THE STAFF WILL BE. LOOKING THROUGH A NUMBER OF SCENARIOS MOSTLY HAVING TO DO WITH- KIND OF. REEVALUATING AND MAKING STAGES AND PHASES OR IN THE APPROVAL PROCESS MAYBE PROVIDING MORE OF A TRIAGE OR PRE APPROVAL PROCESS- THERE'S A NUMBER OF OPTIONS OPTIONS WE WANT TO EXPLORE HERE- BUT ALL AIMED AT THE IDEA OF. GETTING PROGRAMS pTIME REMEMBER THAT. OUR PRIMARY MISSION OF COURSE IS CONSUMER SAFETY- WE MUST MAKE CERTAIN THAT THE SCHOOLS THAT ARE APPROVED. ARE QUALIFIED AND ARE. WELL STAFFED THEY HAVE ACCESS TO ALL THE CRITICAL RESOURCES- CLINICAL PLACEMENTS FACULTY FACILITIES- SO LIKE I SAID IT'S A VERY INTRICATE PROCESS. BUT- WE'D CERTAINLY BE WERE VERY WELCOMING TO. INPUT FROM THE MEMBERS ON THE COMMITTEE STAFF. THANK YOU. NO I APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR CANDOR QUITE FRANKLY AND I UNDERSTAND YOUR CONCERNS AND I CERTAINLY HAVE JOTTED A FEW NOTES DOWN AND CAN SEE HOW SOME OF YOUR ISSUES- COULD BE VERY VERY DETRIMENTAL TO DOING YOUR JOB. I JUST DO WANT TO SAY THAT ON THE ON THE SCHOOL PERSPECTIVE I THINK IF THERE WAS A WAY. THAT WE COULD GIVE THEM SOME SENSE OF A PROCESS A TIMELINE. IT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO PLAN AS WELL EVEN THOUGH YOU FOLKS ARE WORKING THROUGH YOUR PROCESSES AND DOING EVERYTHING THAT YOU NEED TO DO ON YOUR END. I FEEL LIKE WE SHOULD GIVE THEM THAT SAME LEVEL OF COMFORT AS WELL BECAUSE HERE THEY ARE JUST OUT THERE IN EITHER KIND OF NOT KNOWING WHEN AND WHERE THEY ARE THEY CAN START UP. SO I THINK IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A DOUBLE EDGED SWORD I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF SOME OF OUR- SENATE ROTH. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR YOU KNOW I- COME OUT OF THE MILITARY IN THE MILITARY WE HAVE LOTS OF METRICS AND WE USED TO SAY WHAT GETS MEASURED GETS DONE AND TO FOLLOW ALONG WITH THE QUESTIONS FROM MY COLLEAGUES FROM THE ASSEMBLY IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IN THE IN THE SCHOOL APPROVAL PROCESS AND IN OTHER AREAS- WE NEED SOME SORT OF- INTERNAL TIME TARGETS YOU DO ANYWAY IN ORDER TO MEASURE PERFORMANCE. AND SO I WOULD CERTAINLY ENCOURAGE YOU- TO DEVELOP SOME SORT OF INTERNAL. SCHEME OF METRICS WERE YOU SET TIME TARGETS AT VARIOUS POINTS IN PROCESS WHETHER IT'S- SCHOOL APPROVAL OR- ONE OF THE OTHER FUNCTIONS THAT THE BOARD PERFORMS. SO YOU KNOW HOW TO MEASURE THE PERFORMANCE OF YOUR OWN TEAM. AND UNLESS YOU IN WHICH I AS I UNDERSTAND IT YOU MUST NOT HAVE THOSE TARGETS EXCEPT IN THE AREA OF DISCIPLINE AND ENFORCEMENT. AND IF NOT THEN I WOULD SUGGEST THAT YOU SET THEM. AND THAT SIZE INTO THE QUESTION I HAVE ABOUT FISCAL ISSUES AND- THE BOARD AND AT LEAST IN THE BACKGROUND PAPERS THAT WE WERE PROVIDED RAISES CERTAIN. QUESTIONS ABOUT YOUR CURRENT FISCAL SITUATION. AND MY QUESTION GOES TO SCHOOL APPROVAL AND WILL REQUIRE AND YOU REFERENCED A BILL REQUIRING. SCHOOLS TO PAY A FEE FOR APPROVAL RESOLVE THE BOARD'S. FISCAL CONCERNS ENTIRELY OR ARE THERE OTHER ISSUES- THAT IMPACT YOUR FISCAL OUTLOOK. I AM GOING TO TURN THIS OVER TO MS YAMAGUCHI BUT I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A MINUTE TO ADDRESS THE IDEA THAT SCHOOLS WILL NEED TO PAY A FEE. THAT BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING PUT THEIR FEE STRUCTURE IN PLACE. IT'S BEEN PROBABLY FOUR YEARS AGO NOW AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IT HAS DONE IS. TO HELP DIRECTORS LIKE MYSELF TO RECOGNIZE WHEN WE WANT TO MAKE CURRICULAR CHANGES THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYTHING THAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS IN A PACKAGE WE SUBMIT THAT PACKAGE AND THEN THE NEC'S. CAMELBACK PAPERWORK ONE TIME INSTEAD OF PEOPLE SUBMITTING CHANGES MAYBE MULTIPLE TIMES DURING THE YEAR WHICH IS VERY TIME CONSUMING PROCESS THOSE AND IT DOESN'T BENEFIT THE SCHOOLS. OR AND THEY THEY WORK ON THE BBMP TEETH SO FOR MYSELF PERSONALLY AS A DIRECTOR I. DON'T SEE- I DON'T SEE ANY NEGATIVE TWO. ENFORCING SOME FEES ON THE SCHOOLS INCLUDING MY OWN SCHOOL WHICH IS A COMMUNITY COLLEGE. SO WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO TURN THE REST OF THE QUESTION OVER TO MS YAMAGUCHI. KEEP DOCUMENTED THANK YOU SENATOR- THERE ARE OTHER FACTORS INVOLVED IN OUR OUR FISCAL HEALTH ONE OF WHICH OF COURSE IS THAT THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS INCREASED OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS- AND ACTUALLY I THINK IT'S PROBABLY FAIR TO SAY THAT THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS INCREASED- WELL OVER FIVE OR SIX YEARS AGO. M. BECAUSE THE BOARD HAD A VERY SUBSTANTIAL- STAFFING VACANCY RATE THERE IS A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF SALARY SAVINGS WHICH ENABLED THE BOARD TO CONTINUE FUNCTIONING AND THEN WHEN IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WHEN WE STARTED HERE- AND WHAT OUR FIRST PRIORITY OF COURSE WAS. TO MAKE-SURE THAT WE HAVE FULL STAFF AND A FULL MANAGEMENT TEAM- THOSE STATES- SALARY SAVINGS WENT AWAY- WE TRY TO BE AS FRUGAL AS WE POSSIBLY CAN OF COURSE I THINK MOST OF. OUR TEAM WILL VOUCH FOR THE FACT THAT WE ARE AS FRUGAL AS WE POSSIBLY CAN WE INVESTIGATED A NUMBER OF FACTORS VERY WASTEFUL SPENDING THAT- PREVIOUS MANAGEMENT ENGAGED IN. ALL OF THOSE HAVE BEEN CORRECTED AT THIS POINT- AND- ALL. OF THE PANDEMIC. DIGITAL US TO MAKE A VERY SHORT TERM SAVINGS IN AND TRAVEL COSTS THE BUT I THINK THE KEY HERE IS THAT. THE FUNDING STREAM THE REVENUE STREAM NEEDS TO BE STABILIZED IT NEEDS TO BE. BROUGHT UP TO THE POINT WHERE IT IS SUSTAINING THE BOARD'S OPERATION AND IDEALLY CREATING A PRUDENT RESERVE WE THINK- WE'RE TOLD ANYWHERE BETWEEN THREE TO SIX MONTHS OF A RESERVE. IS THE DESIRED. FIGURE WE HAVE A WAYS TO GO BEFORE THAT. THANK YOU CENTER WELL I DON'T I'M NOT BEING NEGATIVE ON CONSIDERING A SCHOOL APPROVAL FEE I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S CLEAR ON THE RECORD. I JUST THINK THAT- THE IMPOSITION OF A OF A FEE ON THE SCHOOL IMPROVEMENT APPROVAL PROCESS IS CERTAINLY GOING TO RAISE THE BAR AND PUBLIC'S EXPECTATIONS SO IT WILL MPHASIZE EVEN MORE THE QUESTIONS THAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE ASSEMBLY ASKED ABOUT INTERNAL- TIME LINES AND GUIDELINES FOR PROCESSING BECAUSE I THINK- YOU WILL BE HELD TO A SLIGHTLY HIGHER STANDARD. WHEN SCHOOLS HAVE TO PAY MONEY IN ORDER TO POTENTIALLY SECURE APPROVAL FROM YOU AND TERMS OF PROCESSING LET ME MOVE ON TO ANOTHER METRICS ISSUE AND THAT'S A FORMAL DISCIPLINE TIMELINES- AND OF COURSE. THE TARGET FOR FORMAL DISCIPLINE. WAS MY UNDERSTANDING IS ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED WHAT FIVE HUNDRED FORTY DAYS EIGHTEEN MONTHS TO COMPLETE THE FORMAL DISCIPLINE PROCESS- THROUGH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S PROCESS. AND OF COURSE YOU THIS BOARD AMONG MANY MANY OTHERS- IS NOT MEETING THAT TARGET. AND JUST TO REFERENCE A LINE IN THE BACKGROUND PAPERS BECAUSE PM FOR WHICH I GUESS IS THIS DISCIPLINE METRIC THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. DOES NOT TRACK CASES BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF TIME SPENT AT ANY GIVEN AGENCY IT IS DIFFICULT TO IDENTIFY THE SOURCE OF POTENTIAL DELAYS SEEMS TO ME THAT THIS NEEDS TO CHANGEWE NEED TO BE ABLE TO MEASURE. THE TIME AT THE CA THE TIME IT THAT YOUR BOARD THE TIME AT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SHOP TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THE BOTTLENECK IS AND WHERE THE FAILURE TO MEET THAT FIVE HUNDRED FORTY DAY. FORMAL DISCIPLINE TIMELINE IS SO WE CAN HELP YOU HELP YOURSELF AND FIX IT IS IT POSSIBLE TO BREAK THAT DOWN SO WE HAVE SOME METRICS AT THE VARIOUS POINTS IN TIME IN THIS FORMAL DISCIPLINE PROCESS. AND HOW DO WE DO THAT. YOU HAVE A GOOD SHE WOULD YOU LIKE TO RESPOND. THANK YOU DR MOUNTAIN THANK YOU THE QUESTION SIR- THAT IS A THAT IS ABSOLUTELY. A GREAT IDEA- ACTUALLY IT'S JUSTIN THE PAST FEW MONTHS- THE DEPARTMENT HAS ACTUALLY PASSED. THE DIVISION OF INVESTIGATIONS TO WORK WITH. THE BOARDS TO. REALLY MAP OUT THE PROCESSES AND THE- WHAT IS OF THE FACTOR IN AGING AND BE ABLE TO TRACK AS YOU SAY FROM STAGE TO STAGE BECAUSE- I KNOW AND I KNOW FOR OUR BOARD AND I'M- I BELIEVE FOR PROBABLY MOST OF THE OTHER BOARDS. THAT THINGS COME INTO OUR OUR- ENFORCEMENT UNIT AND THEY LEAVE FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE OR DO YOU BY. VERY TIMELY- CERTAINLY WITHIN A PARAMETER. BUT BUT CERTAIN CERTAIN THINGS KIND OF CREATE LAGS- OVER THE PAST YEAR I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT- JUST AS LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE LOCAL COURTS. HAVE SORT OF SHUT DOWN OR AT LEAST SLOWED THEIR OPERATIONS THE- THE CRITICAL FACTOR OF. OBTAINING THE PROPER DOCUMENTS HAS BEEN DRAMATICALLY SLOW SO UNFORTUNATELY. PARDON ME. PARDON ME- UNFORTUNATELY I THINK IT'S BECAUSE OF THE WAY THIS UP CYCLE RUNS WERE PROBABLY LOOKING THAT THIS LASTING FOR A BIT BEFORE WE CAN ACTUALLY REALLY START SEEING THAT TEND REVERSED BUT AS I SAID- THE DEPARTMENT DIVISION OF INVESTIGATION. ARE ABSOLUTELY ADDRESSING THIS AND WE HAVE A LOT OF HOPE THAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO CERTAINLY- BREAKOUT PROCESS AND FIGURE OUT WHERE THOSE BOTTLENECKS REALLY ARE IN ONE OF THE CONTRIBUTING CAUSES THERE THANK YOU. WELL GOOD PERHAPS YOU CAN TAKE A LOOK AT THE RECORDS THAT YOU DO HAVE IN THE RECORDS THAT YOU HAVE ACCESS TO IN THE OTHER- GOVERNMENT ENTITIES INVOLVED IN THIS PROCESS AND PROVIDE THE COMMITTEES- SOME INFORMATION AS TO. HOW LONG IT TAKES AT THESE VARIOUS STAGES IN THE FORMAL DISCIPLINE PROCESS AND IF YOU CAN'T DO THAT LET'S AT LEAST IDENTIFY WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IN THE FUTURE SO THAT. THE NEXT TIME WE CALL FOR DATA WE CAN GET A REPORT ON THIS AND- THEN TRY TO GO ABOUT. MAKING THIS PROCESS A LITTLE MORE- EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE SINCE YOU'RE DOING SO WELL IT LOOKS LIKE. MADE TREMENDOUS IMPROVEMENTS IN OTHER AREAS I THINK WE NEED TO WE GOT A BILL TO WORK ON THIS ONE AS WELL. THANK YOU LET ME SHIFT WITH THE CHAIRS PERMISSION LET ME SHIFT TO ONE FINAL QUESTION AND ONE FINAL AREA. AS YOU AS YOU CERTAINLY RECOGNIZE CLINICAL PLACEMENTS. IN HEALTHCARE TRAINING PROGRAMS- HAVE BECOME AN ISSUE SORT OF ACROSS THE BOARD. IN RECENT YEARS CERTAINLY IN THE NURSING FIELD- ALL ALL OVER. AND I WONDER IF YOU COULD ADDRESS CLINICAL PLACEMENT ISSUES- FOR THOSE STUDENTS IN THE PIPELINE UNDER THE- JURISDICTION OF YOUR BOARD- BOAST THREE PANDEMICS. AND DURING THE PANDEMIC. IS THAT A FAIR QUESTION. ABSOLUTELY AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ASKING IT- I THINK I'LL START AND THEN I'LL DEFERRED TO YOU- NEWS FROM A GOOD YOU AGAIN BY CLINICAL PLACEMENTS- FOR ALL OF NURSING IS A HUGE ISSUE DO YOU AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS BEING PUT FORWARD IN THE SACRAMENTO AREA IS WE HAVE A COALITION WHERE DIRECTORS OF PROGRAMS NURSING PROGRAMS AND INDUSTRY PARTNERS. AND THE BOARD'S WORK TOGETHER TO ENSURE THAT THE CLINICAL PLACEMENTS ARE AVAILABLE TO NURSING STUDENTS IN A FAIR WAY SO THAT NOT ONE PROGRAM HAS ALL THE PLACEMENTS AND THE COOPERATION THAT'S HAPPENED IN THE SACRAMENTO AREA THAT IS SPREADING TO OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE AS WE LOOK AT- OTHER METHODOLOGIES AS WELL TO. CERTAINLY CONSIDERING THINGS LIKE SIMULATION WHICH HAS BEEN WITH US FOR ABOUT THE PAST FIFTEEN YEARS- TELEHEALTH ANOTHER THING THAT'S ON THE DOCKET AND RIGHT NOW I KNOW THAT NURSING STUDENTS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ARE HEAVILY INVOLVED IN THE VACCINATION PUSH ROLLOUT AND THAT'S PROVIDING SOME CLINICAL PLACEMENT AS WELL. AS YAMAGUCHI. THANKS ON CENTER YOU'RE YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT THAT ACTUALLY THIS PROBLEM PRECEDED THE PANDEMIC. BUT IN TWENTY TWENTY WHEN VIRTUALLY ALL THE CLINICAL PLACEMENT SITES CLOSED DOWN WOULD NOT ALLOW STUDENTS IN IT CREATED A VERY SUDDEN AND VERY. SHARP CORPORATE CRISIS- FOR THE SCHOOLS TO DEAL WITH AND YOU KNOW AS A AS A SIDE NOTE. THE MANY SEIZE DO THIS IS THIS IS EXACTLY WHY THE NEC SPEND SO VERY MUCH TIME WORKING WITH THE PROGRAMS TO ENSURE THAT THEY D HAVE ADEQUATE RESOURCES GOING FORWARD AND THEY LOOK VERY CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO SIT FOR A SCHOOL TO SAY WELL WE HAVE THESE PLACEMENTS- THEY HAVE TO LOOK AT SEE WHERE THOSE PLACEMENTS ARE AND THE STATE WELL THE OTHER PROGRAM IN RIVERSIDE LIST EXACT SAME THINGS. IS THERE A PROBLEM HERE SO IF YOU LIKE THIS IS A VERY INTRICATE PROCESS BUT- TO MOVE FORWARD I THINK- DR MOUNTAIN IS HAVE TO LOOK AT A VARIETY OF NEW WAYS TO PRODUCE- EXPERIENCE FOR NURSING STUDENTS- BUT ALL THE WHILE I THINK IT'S- IMPORTANT I THINK OUR BOARD HAS BEEN. VERY VERY STRONG IN THE FACT THAT. SIMULATION TELEHEALTH. AND OTHER OTHER ROUGH EXPERIENCES ARE NOT A SUBSTITUTE AND MAY NOT TAKE THE PLACE OF A HUNDRED PERCENT. OF THE CLINICAL DATA OUT EXPERIENCE FOR THE STUDENTS STUDENTS MUST WORK WITH LIFE PATIENCE TO BE QUALIFIED NURSES- THAT'S NOT. IN POLICY THAT'S NOT A LONGER RACE BUT IT'S ESSENTIAL AND I AND I COULD FEEL VERY STRONGLY ABOUT NINE OR BOARD DOES AS WELL. WELL I'VE- LET ME JUST SAY THIS I THINK- THE PROBLEM IS WE NEED MORE HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. CERTAINLY WE NEED MORE NURSES AND THERE'S A FINITE NUMBER OF TRAINING SITES AVAILABLE. SO AND OF COURSE THERE UNDERSERVED AREAS OF THE STATE TODAY THE POPULATION OF THE STATE'S GROWING THAT'S NOT GOING TO MAKE THE UNDERSERVED AREAS FOR PURPOSES OF HEALTH CARE ANY BETTER OFF SO EITHER WE NEED WE'RE GOING TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS IN TRAINING THAT ARE COMING OUT OF THE PIPELINE OR KEEP IT THE SAME OR WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIGURE OUT FAIRLY QUICKLY. HOW WE PROVIDE THE ESSENTIAL TRAINING TO THE INCREASED NUMBER OF HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS. WE NEED TO PRODUCE GIVEN THE FACT THAT IT IS UNLIKELY WE'VE DRAMATICALLY EXPANDED. THE NUMBER OF PHYSICAL TRAINING SITES THAT WE HAVE AROUND THE STATE TO HANDLE THE DEMAND SO IT SEEMS TO ME AND I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM YOU NOT TODAY OBVIOUSLY BUT- AT SOME POINT AS WE MOVE THROUGH THIS PROCESS. OF WHAT THE PLAN IS WHAT THE SCHEDULE IS I NOTICED FROM THE MATERIAL THAT YOU CONDUCTED A- AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING ON SIMULATION AS I RECALL IF I READ IT CORRECTLY. AND WHAT THE PRODUCT OF THAT IS- I REALIZE YOU KNOW THE WAY WE'VE DONE BUSINESS TO WAY WE DO IT TODAY WE- WAY WE'VE DONE BUSINESS IN THE PAST IS NOT TO RELY. AS MUCH ON SIMULATION AND SOME OF THESE OTHER. TECHNIQUES BUT- TELEHEALTH FOR EXAMPLE BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO RE EXPLORE THAT IF WE- ARE INTERESTED IN CRACKING THIS NOT. AND THE NOT BEING HOW TO PROVIDE HEALTH CARE SERVICES. TO THE UNDERSERVED AREAS OF THE STATE. GIVEN OUR LIMIT LIMITATIONS FUNDING LIMITATIONS FOR PUBLIC EDUCATION. BRICK AND MORTAR FACILITIES AND THE LIKE SO I CHALLENGE YOU TO DO THAT AND I LOOK FORWARD TO RECEIVING THE INFORMATION THANK YOU VENTURE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SAYS IN A ROUGH ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHEN FOLLOWED BY SIMPLY MEMBER FALL. THANK YOU TRIMMING LOW AND DETERMINE ROTH FOR THIS HEARING AND FOR YOUR TIME. FIRST AND FOREMOST I WANT TO THANK HIM IS THE LANGUAGE SHE EVERY TIME I'VE INTERACTED WITH HER. ON ISSUES OF MY DISTRICT OR IN MY COMMUNITY SHE'S BEEN EXTREMELY RESPONSIVE. AS WELL AS APPROACHABLE ACCESSIBLE SO I COMMEND YOU. FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND ALL THE TIME BUT YOU GIVEN- FOR MYSELF AND ALSO SOME MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE. I DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS- AND SEEKER GUIDANCE I NOTICED A PART OF THOSE SCHOOL PROGRAM APPROVAL PROCESS. REQUIRES A NURSE EDUCATION CONSULTANT. TO REVIEW THE APPLICATION AND FROM MY UNDERSTANDING IT IS A LONG PROCESS TO HIRING AND REPLACE ANY SEES IF YOU WILL ON THE MORE LEVEL. SO WHAT IT HELPS ALLEVIATE FISCAL SHORTFALLS OF THE BOARD AND SIMULTANEOUSLY SPEED UP THE APPROVAL PROCESS IF WE ALLOW A THIRD PARTY AGENCY IF YOU WILL. TO HELP- ADMINISTERED THE PROGRAM REVIEW. DON'T MISS YAMAGUCHI DEFINITELY TAKE THAT ONE. WELL FIRST OFF THANK YOU SO MUCH RESEARCH HAS ALWAYS BEEN A PLEASURE TO TALK TO YOU AND YOUR STAFF- THIS IS A GREAT QUESTION FOR SO MANY REASONS- THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE STARTED TALKING ABOUT WHEN I BURIED. MY VERY FIRST- MONTHS HERE OF THE BOARD- NEC'S ARE TREMENDOUSLY SKILLED EDUCATED TRAINED- MOST OF THEM HAVE ADVANCED DEGREES OF A FEW OF OUR STAFF HAVE DOCTORS IN FACT- IN YES THE RESOURCES ARE ARE ARE PRETTY FINITE SO ONE OF THINGS WE HAD BEEN LOOKING INTO DISCUSSING IT INTERNALLY IS. ARE THERE WAYS THAT WE CAN STRETCH THAT RESOURCE ARE THERE ARE WAYS THAT WE COULD EMPLOY FOR EXAMPLE- ANALYSTS TO WORK WITH THE NEC'S TO ENABLE THEM TO COVER MORE GROUND. AND WE'VE- FOUND MOSTLY THAT AND ANALYST WOULD REQUIRE A VAST AMOUNT OF TRAINING- TO BE ABLE TO. REALLY HAVE THAT INSIGHT THAT ABILITY TO FIND FLAWS ARE FINE- POTENTIAL VIOLATIONS IN IN FOR EXAMPLE A SCHOOLS FACILITIES OR CURRICULUM IT REALLY DOES REQUIRE SOMEBODY WITH A GOOD AMOUNT OF EXPERTISE. ONE THING WE TALKED ABOUT- IN IN THIS WOULD REQUIRE SOME SOME WITH WITH CALLIE JAR IN THE STATE PERSONNEL BOARD ONE THINGS WE TALKED ABOUT WAS BEING ABLE TO. HIRE AN IMPACT EMPOWER. ACTIVE LICENSEES- VOCATIONAL NURSING AND PSYCHIATRIC TECHNICIANS TO HELP PROVIDE THAT KIND OF A RESOURCE THAT ON THE GROUND RESEARCH AND ANALYSIS THAT FACT FINDING BECAUSE- AS AS LICENSEES THEY BEEN THROUGH THE PROGRAMS THEY WOULD KNOW WHAT TO LOOK FOR. THEY WOULD UNDERSTAND CERTAINLY FROM THEIR OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WHAT WORKED AND WHAT WOULDN'T WORK- THESE ARE WHAT THE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT I THINK- BUT I DO WANT TO I DO WANT TO SEE VERY. VERY FIRMLY THOUGH THAT ARE NEC'S ARE AMAZING AND WE'VE BEEN VERY VERY FORTUNATE IN OUR TEAM- AT THIS POINT TIME WE DO HAVE SIX AS I MENTIONED BEFORE- WE'VE LOST ONE LAST YEAR- SHE RETIRED- BUT OUR TEAM IS VERY UNIFIED IN VERY VERY. EXPERIENCE AND INTERESTINGLY THEIR EXPERIENCE IN A VERY DIVERSE AREA SO WE HAVE PEOPLE WHOSE EXPERTISE IS CURRICULUM PEOPLE WHO. DID MORE FACULTY MORE FACILITIES SO WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO I THINK STRUCTURE THAT. BY HAVING KIND OF A- BUT A LEAD IF YOU WILL. ON THAT FIRMANDO MR TRUMP I APOLOGIZE BECAUSE I'M NOT CERTAIN I'M GETTING ALL THE FACETS OF YOUR QUESTION. NO I THINK YOU'RE A ANSWERING TO THE QUESTION APPROPRIATELY AND IF I MAY- I DO WANT TO TALK ABOUT ANOTHER SUBJECT IF THAT'S RAIMES ALLERGY AND- MILLER SUBJECT I SEE IS YOU HEAR NOT ONLY FROM MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE. THE ALL THROUGHOUT THE STATE IN TERMS OF A HOPE AND A NEED TO EXPEDITE. THE APPROVAL NURSING PROGRAM PROCESS AND- THIS TEAM CHAIRMAN ROB WAS TALKING ABOUT HOW INDIAN DURING THIS PANDEMIC WE HOPE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A PIPELINE. OF PRACTITIONERS TO BE ABLE TO GET IN THE FRONT LINES AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND WE'VE HEARD ALL THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THAT THERE COULD BE ANYWHERE BETWEEN WAYS OF TO WIN THREE YEARS- AND THERE'S A POSSIBILITY OF PERHAPS- TAKING AWAY SOME THE REDUNDANCIES WHAT ELIMINATE SOME OF THE REDUNDANCIES- ON THE BOARD LEVEL TO SPEED UP THE APPROVAL PROCESS TO ADDRESS. AS I UNDERSTAND THE CURRENT BACKLOG- IS THERE A PROCESS RIGHT NOW TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE REDUNDANCIES. I ASSUME YOU WANT ME TO ANSWER THE STOCK AMOUNT. MISTER CHENEY EXACTLY RIGHT ONE- WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT SEVERAL JOURNALISM. FOR ONE WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT- IS IT POSSIBLE TO SPLIT THE LIST AND- HAVE A LIST FOR PRIVATE SCHOOLS AND THEN A SEPARATE LIST FOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS. AND ALLOW US TO ADDRESS THEM- SORT OF IN TANDEM. WHICH- BECAUSE- PRIVATE SCHOOLS AND PRIVATE SCHOOL PROPOSALS. VASTLY OUTNUMBERED THE PUBLIC PROPOSALS AND THIS WOULD ACCELERATE THE APPROVAL OF THE PUBLIC PROGRAMS- ONE OF THE THINGS WE TALKED ABOUT OF COURSE WAS A- LOOKING INTO WAY TO STAGE OUT THE APPROVAL PROCESS. AND DO A LITTLE BIT MORE INITIAL TRIAGE- WHEN THE INITIAL PROPOSAL THE INITIAL LETTER OF INTENT YEARS RECEIVED- WE THINK THAT THAT WOULD. THAT WOULD HELP I THINK KIND OF. A FOCUS AND SO. AT THAT POINT WE WOULD HAVE I THINK OF MORE. TRIAGE PRIORITIZE APPROVAL PROCESS- WE WOULD REQUIRE RAKES FOR THIS- I THINK THAT I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT- THERE ARE A NUMBER OF STEPS THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO. EXPLORE AND MOST WOULD REQUIRE SOME SEVERAL MAKING ACTIVITY WELL THE IDEAS THAT WE HAD TALKED ABOUT I THINK A BIT. WAS- THE VERY IDEA OF. ALLOWING PROGRAM SCHOOLS THAT HAVE MULTIPLE CAMPUSES- IF THEY'RE USING EXACTLY THE SAME CURRICULUM EXACTLY SAME POLICIES. SHOULD THEY JUST HAVE AN ACCELERATED APPROVAL PROCESS. WHICH IS- A VERY INTERESTING IDEA. EDIT IT WOULD SUIT THE GOAL OF HAVING MORE PROGRAMS OPEN AND MORE STUDENT SEATS AVAILABLE QUICKLY. BUT WHAT IT WOULD DO OF COURSE THAT IS ALSO CREATE MORE OF- BUT AWFULLY SYSTEM WHERE. THE LARGER BETTER FUNDED PROGRAMS DO. START TO ACQUIRE MORE OF A PRESENCE AND- NOT NECESSARILY A BAD THING I WILL TELL YOU THAT. BUT AT THE SAME TIME BECAUSE WE DO WANT- PROGRAMS FROM UNDERSERVED AREAS SMALLER PROGRAMS- PROGRAMS THAT ARE AFFILIATED WITH LIKE FOR EXAMPLE COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION. IT'S SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE EXPLORED CAREFULLY- IN PERHAPS BUT AS YOU KNOW IT IT'S A VERY LONG PROCESS TO MAKE A DECISION LET ALONE TO LAUNCH A NEW WAY OF DOING BUSINESS- BUT IT THESE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS WE'VE DISCUSSED DOING- AS I SAY. SOME OF THEM YOUR BOARD CAN ACT ON ON SOME SOME NOTIONS THAT CAN HELP US TO BETTER PROCESS THAT WAITING LIST AND THAT APPLICATION TIME. HELLO I'M- YOU SPOKE TO NO REDUNDANCIES IT. YOU KNOW EXCESSIVE PROCESSES I THINK- AND THAT IS FAIR I THINK BECAUSE- AS I SAID I THINK EARLIER. OF THE ONE OF THE- MOST TIME CONSUMING. PARTS OF THE PROCESS IS THE REVIEW AND APPROVAL OF CURRICULUM. OF ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT WHICH PEOPLE EITHER LOVE OR HATE. IS SHOULD THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAVE A UNIFORM CURRICULUM. AND THAT CHANGES EVERYTHING- THAT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD CONSIDER AND I KNOW THAT OUR BOARD WILL CERTAINLY BE DISCUSSING. DR MOUNTED YOU WANT TO ADD ANYTHING TO THAT. AND I AM ABSOLUTELY 100% IN SUPPORT OF THAT UNIFIED CURRICULUM ACROSS THE STATE AND I THINK THAT IT WOULD CERTAINLY ADDRESS SEVERAL ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP TO DATE AND IF THERE'S UNIFIED CURRICULUM THEN THE CLINICAL USAGE WILL BE. MORE EQUITABLE ACROSS THE BOARD AND PROGRAMS COULD WORK MORE COOPERATIVELY AND SO THAT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING. THAT I AS A BOARD PRESIDENT OF SUPPORT AND I BELIEVE THAT THE REST OF THE BOARD IS ABSOLUTELY OPEN TO CONSIDERING. A GERMAN LOS AMASSED ONE FINAL QUESTION CHAIRMAN ROTH AS WELL- AND OFFER GO THE REST OF MY QUESTIONS- THIS IS BEEN VERY INSIGHTFUL- I WANTED TO. TAKE YOU BACK ON MY STEAM CALLING FOR RIPPON'S QUESTION AND- HE STATED THAT- SOME OF THE FOLKS- THAT WE'VE BEEN SEEING THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AS HE SAYS IT GOES INTO THIS EITHER THROUGH THAT APPROVAL APPLICATION PROCESS. AND THEY WILL GO TO YOUR DOCTOR BROWN NOR- DIRECTOR- YOU LABEL G. AND- ASK YOU WHERE'S THE PROCESS GOING WHERE ARE WE- AND FOR YOUR MEMBERS AND STAFF. AS WELL AND- IN THE EFFORT FOR CALIFORNIA ESPECIALLY DURING THIS PANDEMIC TO HAVE A CUSTOMER FRIENDLY TYPE OF SERVICE BASED ADMINISTRATION- WE'VE WE GET SOMETHING ON THE PRIVATE SECTOR SIDE- AND I HAD OTHER MEMBERS- SAY SOMETHING SIMILAR- WE SEE SOMETHING IN PROCESS. CLINICAL PACKAGE RECEIVED PACKAGE DELIVERED PACKAGE. YET IN PROCESS FROM A TO B. IS THERE SOMETHING IS THERE SOMETHING IN WHICH ONE A PROCESS GOES THROUGH- CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS CAN BE TREATED AS A CUSTOMER WHERE THEY SAY OKAY HERE'S MY APPROVAL PROCESS THIS IS WHERE IT IS AT THIS STAGE AT THIS POINT. AND AT THE GET A AT LEAST AN IDEA OF WHERE IT IS AS OPPOSED. TO PERHAPS JUST. PUTTING IT IN A PROCESS WHERE THEY DO KNOW IT IS IT'S IT IN LIMBO. IT IS SIX MONTHS AWAY SEVEN MONTHS AWAY WHAT WHAT INFORMATION DO THEY NEED TO GIVE TO YOU TO TRY TO GET TO WHERE THEY WANT TO GO BECAUSE I THINK. CERTAINLY YOUR GOALS AND THEIR GOALS ARE THE SAME THEY THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO RIDE SERVICE- TO OUR FOR FORTY MILLION RESIDENTS IN CALIFORNIA SO IS THERE A WAY IN WHICH WE CAN GIVE THEM AT LEAST A TIME LINE AS THEY GO THROUGH THIS. OUR PROCESS OF. WHERE THEY ARE IN THE SYSTEM. EVENIF- IT EVEN. BETTER TO HAVE. A TIME FRAME COMPONENT ADDED TO THAT. THAT IS A THAT IS MY QUESTION WITHOUT OFFER GO TO REST MY QUESTIONS. COULD YOU WOULD YOU LIKE TO ADDRESS THAT PLEASE. THANK YOU. ACTUALLY WE DO EXACTLY THAT BUT IN A VERY RUDIMENTARY AND VERY. VERY RUDIMENTARY ALSO STATE WAY WHAT- WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT. A COUPLE TIMES A YEAR- OUR STAFF WILL LOOK AT THE- THE WAITING LIST AND THEY'LL CONTACT THE FOLKS WHO MADE THE PROPOSAL- USUALLY WE HAVE ASKED. YOUR NUMBER TWENTY SEVEN ON THE LIST WE THINK IT'S PROBABLY GONNA BE ANOTHER YEAR BEFORE AN NEC IS A SIGN YOUR PROGRAM DO YOU WANT TO STAY ON THE LIST- IN SOME CASES WHEN WE- NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND AND CONTACT. THE PEOPLE PROPOSING THEM WE OF COURSE. EXERCISE A LITTLE BIT OF A PATRICIAN PRUNING OF THE LIST THERE WHICH DEBT BUT IT DOESN'T HAPPEN VERY OFTEN- I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT. WHAT WE DO PROVIDE IS WHAT WE CAN PROVIDE AT THIS POINT BECAUSE AS I SAID. IN TILL IT REACHES A CERTAIN OINT ON THE LIST AND RIGHT NOW IT'S YOU KNOW. ONCE YOU GET TO BE SOMEWHERE ABOUT. BETWEEN I THINK TEN AND TWENTY- YOU'RE WAITING. AND THERE'S NOT MUCH YOU CAN DO ALTHOUGH WE DO STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU PEOPLE WORKING UNDER YOUR POLICIES AND PROCEDURES IN YOUR CURRICULUM. BUT THERE'S NOT A WAY TO SAY. YOUR SIX MONTHS OUT YOUR TEN MONTHS OUT YOUR TWO YEARS OUT. WITH ANY DEGREE OF ACCURACY BECAUSE THE PROCESS ITSELF IS SORT OF VERY. INCONSISTENT DOESN'T REALLY WORK I WANT BUT- IT VERY SO STRONGLY FROM FROM PROGRAM TO PROGRAM. AND UNFORTUNATELY. I'M A BIG PART OF THAT VARIANCE HAS TO DO WITH THE PEOPLE INVOLVED WHEN THEY DON'T REPLY IN A TIMELY MANNER OR THEY SUBMIT- OF INACCURATE INCOMPLETE INFORMATION THAT THE NEC STARTS TO REVIEW. AND THEN RETURNED SAYING THANK YOU THAT'S GREAT BUT YOU'RE MISSING PARTS THREE FOUR FIVE AND THEN THEY SEND THAT BACK IN THE PROPOSING BODY CHáVEZ PART THREE BUT NOT FOREIGN FIVE AND THERE'S A BACK AND FORTH AND BACK AND FORTH AND THAT DOES ABSORB A VAST AMOUNT OF TIME- ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK WE TALKED ABOUT WITH THEM. THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE STAFF IS. WE PROBABLY SHOULD CREATE TIGHTER TIMELINES- REQUIREMENTS THAT IF YOU DON'T RESPOND WITHIN SIX WEEKS SIX DAYS- YOU GO ON AN INACTIVE YOU GO SOME BUT YOU KNOW BASICALLY YOU LOSE YOUR PLACE IN LINE ARE YOU GO TO AN ACTIVE WE WOULD NEED A DESIGN- STRUCTURE LIKE THAT. AGAIN THIS WOULD ALMOST CERTAINLY REQUIRE WILL MAKING- BUT THERE'S A THERE'S A NUMBER OF ALTERNATIVES AND- AND I AND I UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT YOU IN THE OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS ARE SAYING THAT. CERTAINLY IT WOULD BE FAIR AND IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE FOR US TO. OF I THINK IMPROVE OUR COMMUNICATIONS AND TRANSPARENCY. THANK YOU. VIDYALAYAM OF WORK- ASSEMBLY MEMBER FONG FOLLOWED BY A DOCTOR PAN AND THEN SENATOR ROTH. BUT THEY DID WAS CHAIR- I JUST WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON. A FEW ITEMS MAYBE DIVE DEEPER WITH THE SENATE CHAIR HAD MENTIONED AND ALSO MY COLLEAGUE FROM RIP AND- SAID THESE SCHOOLS HAVE TO BE ACCREDITED- FOR EDUCATIONAL QUALITY AND WHICH IS EXTENSIVE APPROVAL PROCESS AND THEN SEPARATELY. THAT THERE'S ANOTHER APPROVAL PROCESS THAT THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH. WITH THE BUREAU FOR PRIVATE POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION. SO ANOTHER EXTENSIVE- PROCESS AND IT SEEMS O ME THAT. AS YOU AND I INDICATED THAT THERE IS ALREADY AN EXTENSIVE TIME LINE- OR ACTUALLY WERE TRYING TO SET UP A TIME LINE- SO. WHY IS THERE A NEED FOR. TO PROCESS THESE. FOR PRIVIL GE. SHE FOR CALLING THE- THE BUREAU OF PRIVATE SECONDARY LOOK AT A PROGRAM BASED ON ITS ITS INFRASTRUCTURE ITS FISCAL HEALTH YEAH- IT STE INSTITUTIONAL IF YOU WILL AND OUR FOCUS IS SPECIFIC TO THAT THE ACADEMIC PROGRAM INVOLVED SO THE TO SORT OF DOVETAIL TOGETHER. THERE IS NOT. AN APPRECIABLE AMOUNT OF REDUNDANCY BUT WHEN ISSUES DO CROP UP FOR EXAMPLE ACOUPLE YEARS AGO I THINK A LOT OF YOU ESPECIALLY. THOSE OF YOU IN THE SAN DIEGO LOS ANGELES AREA REMEMBER THAT WE HAD A SITUATION WHERE THE SCHOOL ABRUPTLY CLOSED ITS DOORS AND- WE HAD TO SCRAMBLE AND WE WORKED VERY CLOSELY WITH THE BUREAU. TO ENSURE THAT THERE WAS A TEACH OUT THAT THE STUDENTS WERE ABLE TO FINISH THEIR PROGRAMS DESPITE THE- THE PROGRAM ITSELF RUN OFF. SO WE DO WORK WELL TOGETHER WE COMMUNICATE ON ON THE ISSUES I THINK WE SHARE INFORMATION- VERY WELL. HE ACTUALLY USED TO BE MY UPSTAIRS NEIGHBORS IT WAS A LOT EASIER TO RUN UPSTAIRS BUT- I THINK I THINK WE FOUND- THAT WE WORK WELL TOGETHER I THINK OF. OUR NURSES GEN ESPECIALLY ARE SUPERVISING NURSING. EDUCATION CONSULTANT. HAS BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE. A LOT OF DIALOGUE BACK AND FORTH WHERE WE SHARED. NOT JUST THE INFORMATION ON CURRENT SITUATIONS BUT THE WAY WE DO BUSINESS- WOULD IT BE BETTER TO HAVE A SINGLE ENTITY. POSSIBLY POSSIBLY BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE DON'T HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO REALLY EVALUATE- IT'S FISCAL HEALTH FOR EXAMPLE- THAT WOULD REQUIRE SOME VERY DEEP ANALYSIS AND HE DOES NOT HAVE THE- CAPABILITIES TO EVALUATE WHETHER THAT NURSING PROGRAM AT THAT SITE CHECK PROGRAM MEETS ALL THE CRITERIA AND HOW AND WHY. SO ARE YOU SAYING THAT THE PROCESS IS NOT DIFFICULT THEREOF OR THAT THERE ARE THERE THERE IS DUPLICATION IN THE INTERVIEW PROCESS HE'S. I'M SORRY MR FONG THE SOUND CUT IN AND OUT ON THE OR ARE YOU SAYING THAT THERE IS NO DUPLICATION IN THE PROBLEM THE TO PROCESS THESE OR- ARE YOU SAYING THAT THERE IS DUPLICATION THAT NEEDS TO BE. HAMMERED OUT. I DON'T THINK THERE'S DUPLICATION I THINK THERE AREAS THAT WE- MUST WORK TOGETHER TO DO. THE PEOPLE'S BUSINESS BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S DUPLICATIVE SO I'M I'M I'M READING THE ANALYSIS THAT WAS PROVIDED BY THE COMMITTEE STAFF AND IT INDICATES THAT- THE BUREAU FOR PRIVATE POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION. AND OTHER PRIVATE INSTITUTIONAL PROGRAM MAKE THE CREDITORS THEY ARE APPROVED BY THE US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND TREATED SHE THAT RECOGNITION YOU HAVE TO ESTABLISH EXPECTATIONS REVIEW THE FOLLOWING A GOOD CURRICULUM FACULTY SUCCESS AND STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT. FACULTIES EQUIPMENT SUPPLIES FISCAL IN A MEASURE OF CAPACITY STUDENT SUPPORT SERVICES RECRUITING ANIMATION PRACTICES MEASURES A PROGRAM LENGTH I MEAN THERE'S A LIST OF TEN ITEMS. DO THOSE ITEMS DO YOU REVIEW THOSE ITEMS TO. IN YOUR PROCESS. YES AND NO BECAUSE I THINK- ENOUGH AMOUNT CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG IN THE ACCREDITATION PROCESS- OFTENTIMES AT LEAST HERE IN CALIFORNIA- THE CREDITORS WILL LOOK. AT CURRICULUM AND EVEN ISSUES REGARDING REVOLVING AROUND THE ACADEMIC PROGRAM ITSELF AND ESSENTIALLY A LOT OF TIMES THEY WILL BASICALLY SAY. MEETS THE BOARD'S CRITERIA AND IS APPROVED BY THE BOARD AND THEY CHECKED THE BOX- IN TERMS OF UP TO SEE. AT YES. WE DO THAT TO. DOES THE PROBE HAVE. ADEQUATE AMOUNTS OF DESKS AT AND COULD AT A LIVE. IS IT C. IS A CLEAN. UP WE DO EXAMINE THE FAST. AND THIS THING TO IMPROVE SCHOOL. AND I DO KNOW THAT- THAN A CREDITOR WILL BE LOOKING AT THOSE FACTORS AS WELL. I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE. YOUR ANSWERS I JUST WOULD SAY THAT- IT SEEMS TO BE THAT THERE IS NEEDED IMPROVEMENT I THINK I THINK EVERYONE HERE CAN SEE THAT- THERE IS SOME DUPLICATION I WOULD I WOULD VENTURE TO BET THAT AN OBJECTIVE REVIEW. WITH YOU THAT THERE IS- I WOULD ECHO WHAT THE SENATOR SAID THERE IS A NEED FOR. MORE MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS- ESPECIALLY IN THE AREA OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY- WE HAVE AND THE PANDEMIC AS REVEALED- THE STRUCTURAL ISSUES THAT- I BELIEVE WE ALL KNOW HAS EXISTED FOR A WHILE- INTO WHETHER- THE PANDEMIC HAS ACCELERATED THESE NEEDS WE'RE CERTAINLY I THINK IS THE CASE IS THE AND PUBLIC UNDERSTATEMENT OF THE MORNING- I THINK WE CERTAINLY DO NEED TO LOOK AT- PUTTING. WE'RE IMPROVING THE PROCESS ESPECIALLY WHEN WE HAVE A OF AN APPARENT BACKLOG OF FIFTY FOUR SCHOOLS- THEY'RE LOOKING FOR APPROVAL- FOLLOWING UP ON ON MY OTHER COLLEAGUES THAT THAT. THAT THE- THERE NEEDS TO BE- TIMELINES AND- AND IMPROVEMENT OF THE PROCESS SO THAT- THERE'S THE NEED NO AND KNOWLEDGE OF DEADLINES AND EVERYTHING ELSE LIKE THAT- I THINK THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF INFORMATION PROVIDED IN THE WORK TO BE DONE TO IMPROVE THAT PROCESS SO. I APPRECIATE THE ANSWERS AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH. K. THE YOU A QUICK FOR BY PAN FOR A FALL BY CENTER RON. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ACTION MY QUESTION IS ACTUALLY UP ALSO TO SOME QUESTIONS THAT FROM CENTER ROTH AND JUST FOR FULL DISCLOSURE I MYSELF ACTUALLY SERVED ON THE BOARD OF AN ACCREDITATION. AGENCY AND- NATIONAL WONDER TRADITION COUNSELING GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION. AND I MYSELF ALSO WAS A DIRECTOR OF EDUCATION PROGRAM THOSE ACCREDITED THERE FOR NEW WAS LIKE TO HAVE TO. SUBMIT PAPERWORK AND DOCUMENTS STUFF FOR ACCREDITATION SO I'VE BEEN ON BOTH SIDES. THE ISSUE AND IT'S CERTAINLY ON- AT LEAST HAVE SOME UNDERSTAND THE CHALLENGES THE BOARD HAS AND IN THOSE ROLES RIGHT HAVING TO PROVE PROGRAMS AND SO FORTH- SO I GUESS THE- BRIEF COMMENT AND THEN A QUESTION- THE COMMENT IS- I KNOW AN ISSUE SIXTEEN CLINICAL PLACEMENTS- AS A BOARD- PROBABLY BUT CHALLENGED BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT REALLY IN A ROLL OF FINDING CLINICAL PLACEMENTS BUT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S NOT UNIQUE CERTAINLY TO THIS PARTICULAR PROFESSION. AND WE DO NEED TO THINK ABOUT- FRANKLY- YOU KNOW. HAVING TRAINEES COSTS MONEY FOR ANY CLINICAL SITE ALL RIGHT I MEAN I DID RESEARCH AND- AND WORKFORCE AND THE COST OF ACTUALLY TRAINING. IN AND CLINICAL SITES AND DAY AT AND SO OFTEN TIMES WE- EXPECT THE CHARITY OF THE BUYER'S CLINICAL SITES BUT THAT'S NOT WORKING OUT EFFECTIVE MANY UNFORTUNATELY MANY PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS. GET THEIR CLINICAL SITE BY ACTUALLY PAYING FOR THEM. WHICH ACTUALLY DISADVANTAGES SOMETIMES PUBLIC PROGRAMS- HOOCH MAY NOT HAVE ITS NAY RESOURCES SO I THINK JUST I WANTED PAN ON THAT FOR. US TO CONSIDER IN TERMS OF. WHAT WE DO IN TERMS OF PROVIDING CLINICAL SITES ONLY FOR THIS- PARTICULAR PROFESSION BUT OTHERS THE QUESTION I HAVE FOR YOU THOUGH IS THAT. I DO WE TALK ABOUT DUPLICATION. BETWEEN BETWEEN ACCREDITATION AGENCIES IN THE BOARD'S ROLE. DOES THE% BOARD IT'S AN AND YOU'D MENTIONED ALSO ABOUT LOOKING AT STANDARDIZED CURRICULUM AS WELL AND- AND THE WORK BEHIND THAT IT DOES THE- WHEN YOU- A- SCHOOL. I'D DO YOU ACTUALLY GET ALL THE DOCUMENTS TO THE SCHOOL ALSO- BASICALLY DO YOU- THE DOCUMENTS THEY HAVE TO SUBMIT FOR ACCREDITATION DO CAN THEY JUST SUBMIT THE SIMILAR SAME TO DOCUMENT YOU MAY WANT TO ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON TOP OF THAT BUT INSTEAD OF TRYING TO HAVE TO HAVE YOUR OWN VERSION OF THE SAME THING SO BASIS SO IN TERMS OF TRYING TO REDUCE THE- THE SORT OF OVERHEAD. OF US SUBMITTING AN APPLICATION AND THEN- IN TERMS OF YOUR REVIEW PROCESS DO YOU TAKE ACCOUNT OF WHAT THE SCHOOLS HAVE TO SUBMIT TO OTHER AGENTS OTHER ACCREDITING BODIES. IN YOUR APPROVAL TO TRY THIS AGAIN STREAMLINED THE PROCESS FOR THE- FOR THE SCHOOLS THEY'RE TRYING TO SUBMIT. SOME ADULTS PAPERWORK. I THINK I'LL GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF AN ANSWER THEN I'LL TURN IT OVER TO MS YAMAGUCHI HAVING JUST BEEN THROUGH MIGHT BE VNPT. ACCREDITATION PROCESS DURING THE PANDEMIC LAST SUMMER- THERE IS SOME OVERLAP AND I DRAW FROM SO WE ARE WATCHING ACCREDITED BECAUSE WE'RE COMMUNITY COLLEGE WHERE I WORK- AND SO I AM ABLE TO DRAW FROM SOME OF THOSE. DOCUMENTS AND THEY DO FIT IN TO WHAT I HAVE TO TURN IN. TO THE BBMP TEAM BUT TRULY THE ACCREDITING AGENCIES ARE LOOKING AT DIFFERENT THINGS ADDITIONALLY IN NURSING THERE IS NATIONAL ACCREDITATION CALLED HE SAID HE C. N. THAT. THAT WAS A CREDIT A CREDIT. THE END PROGRAM. AND SOME HAVE CHOSEN TO GET THAT ADDITIONAL NATIONAL ACCREDITATION WHICH VERY MUCH DUCK TALES WHAT THE BOARD. LOOKS AT AND THEN IT'S VERY EASY TO USE THOSE DOCUMENTS TO CROSS OVER BUT TRULY THESE ACCREDITING AGENCIES ARE LOOKING AT SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAN WHAT THE NEC IS EVALUATING. WHEN THEY COME IN AND ARE LOOKING AT VERY PROGRAM SPECIFIC ISSUES. TO ENSURE THAT NURSING NURSES ARE GRADUATING WITH ADEQUATE INFORMATION TO TAKE CARE OF PATIENTS AND IT'S REALLY PROTECTING THE PUBLIC IN THAT METHODOLOGY. MS YAMAGUCHI. I DON'T THINK IT HAD ANYTHING TO THAT. THANK YOU WELL I GUESS I WOULD JUST SAY IS THAT- IT MIGHT BE WORTH A CONVERSATION WITH THE VARIOUS ACCREDITATION AGENCIES I KNOW THAT'S NOT EXACTLY YOU'RE LOOKING IS ACTUALLY THE SAME THING BUT I THINK WE'RE TERMS AGAIN TRYING TO REDUCE DUPLICATION AND STREAMLINE THE PROCESS- THAT- THERE MAY BE SOME BENEFIT TRYING TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE- HOW HOW THE TWO PROCESSES. WELL YOU KNOW A LINER NOT A LINE AND WHAT AND HOW DO WE THE FLOW OF INFORMATION- THAT HAS TO HAPPEN AND THAT EXPENSE RELATED TO THAT AS WELL BOTH IN TIME AND- MANPOWER MISTER MANPOWER THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATE ROTH. THANK YOU JUST A QUICK. FOLLOW UP QUESTION TO THE QUESTION MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE ASEMBLY ASK ABOUT TO SCHOOL APPROVALS. YOU MENTIONED UNIVERSAL CURRICULUM AND TO ME THAT- IF IMPOSE THAT WOULD SEEM A BIT- POTENTIALLY DISRUPTIVE ANYWAY IN IN IN THE STATE. BUT WOULD THERE BE ANY IMPEDIMENT FOR THE BOARD TO ADOPT A COMMON CURRICULUM COMMON POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. COVERING VOCATIONAL. NURSE EDUCATION FOR EXAMPLE. THAT IF A PROPOSED ADOPTED THOSE. THE APPROVAL PROCESS WOULD BE MUCH EXPEDITED. NOT REQUIRED BUT IF ADOPTED A COMMON CURRICULUM. COLIN POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AS A SET. AND IF THE SCHOOL SAID YES THAT'S FINE WITH US. HOW MUCH TIME WOULD THAT CUT OFF OF YOUR APPROVAL PROCESS. AND WOULD THAT HELP TO REDUCE THE BACKLOG. I AM GOING TO TURN THIS OVER TO ME YOU HAVE A GOOD YEAR BUT I DID WANT TO MENTION THAT- THE STATE OF OREGON HAS ALREADY INSTITUTED- AND- THE- STATEWIDE CURRICULUM. AND THEY DID IT- SEVERAL YEARS AGO AND IT'S BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL SCHOOLS CAN CHOOSE TO NOT BE PART OF THAT. BUT I THINK THAT IT HAS- DEFINITELY CONTRIBUTED TO THEIR ABILITY. TO PRODUCE WELL EQUIPPED NURSES TO COME OUT INTO THE FIELD AND IT IS ALSO PROVIDE THE OPPORTUNITY THAT IF A STUDENT NEEDS TO MOVE FROM ONE AREA TO ANOTHER WITHIN THE STATE YOU'RE ABLE TO TRANSFER IN THOSE PROGRAMS SO I STATEWIDE CURRICULUM WOULD BE A HUGE ADVANTAGE I THINK TO STUDENTS AND TO CONSUMERS WHO KNOW THAT THEIR- THEY ARE- GETTING INTEREST IS TRAIN THROUGH ITS METHODOLOGY- SO YES IT WOULD BE A BIG UNDERTAKING. BUT I THINK IN THAT THE LONG TERM GAIN FOR NURSING AND FOR THE PUBLIC WOULD BE HUGE YAMAGUCHI. I THINK- MISTER CHAIRMAN I THINK TEAR YOUR QUESTION. WOULD IT SAVE TIME I WOULD THINK IN THE IN THE LONG RANGE YES IT WOULD- JUST BECAUSE WE WOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT AS A AS A GIVEN AND THEN. THE NEC'S WOULD BE ABLE LOOK AT ALL THE OTHER FACTORS INVOLVED ESPECIALLY THE MORE REGIONALLY BASED ONES- THE CHALLENGE OF COURSE IS THAT SHORT TERM. IT WOULD DELAY THE PROCESS BECAUSE WE WOULD NEED TO- I WOULD NEED TO PROBABLY RE ASSIGNED A STAFF PERSON TO DEVELOP. YOU KNOW BASED ON ALL THE BEST PRACTICES THT WE'VE SEEN FROM. THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE DOING REALLY REALLY WELL AND HAVE HISTORICALLY ALWAYS DONE SO- AND THEN OF COURSE THERE IS THE POINT THAT. I WOOD AGAIN THIS WOULD BE SUBJECT TO RULE MAKING. AND THAT IS. PROBABLY A YEAR OR MORE OF A PROCESS- LOOK I'M I'M SUGGESTING THAT PEOPLE HAVE CHOICE BUT- AS AS THE REGULATOR YOU MUSTKNOW WHAT YOU LOOK AT IT AND EXPECT TO SEE IN A CURRICULUM SO I'M NOT SURE THAT I UNDERSTAND WHY IT WOULD BE SO TERRIBLY DIFFICULT TO SPELL OUT. EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IN A CURRICULUM IN A COMMON CORE CURRICULUM WITH POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT COULD BE IS ON THE SHELF AND IF THE SCHOOL WANTS TO ACCEPTED. THEY ACCEPTED AND SAY GOOD WE'RE GOING TO GO WITH THAT SO YOU CAN MOVE ON TO SOMETHING ELSE BEYOND CURRICULUM POLICIES AND PROCEDURES I ASSUME IT'S BRICK AND MORTAR FACILITIES SINCE IT'S A CLINICAL PLACEMENTS AND ALL THE OTHER ISSUES THAT YOU LOOK AT. MISTRETTA MAKE IT SIMPLE AND I THINK OF WHAT THE PRESIDENT WAS SAYING WE'RE SAYING THE SAME THING SHE CALLS OF THE STATE CURRICULUM BUT IF THE STATE CURRICULUM A CHOICE SOMEONE CAN OPT OUT AND DO SOMETHING MORE. MORE- A SPECIFIC IF THEY WANT TO IF THEY WANT TO ENCOURAGE THE DELAY THAT THAT'S GOING TO- BECAUSE IN TERMS OF THE APPROVAL PROCESS I JUST AS THE TO TAKE A LOOK AT IT I DON'T WANT TO BELABOR IT TODAY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR RESPONSE THANK YOU MISTER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I SEE NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS AGGRESSOR CONDEMNS ALL. I GET INTO THIS. THEN DIRECTLY- LANDED YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR COOPERATION AS YOU KNOW THAT WE'VE BEEN IN A NUMEROUS CONVERSATIONS AT THE STAFF LEVEL AND AT THE DIRECT MEMBER LEVEL ON A NUMBER OF ISSUES AND- I HAD THE PLEASURE OF SERVING IN THIS CAPACITY WHEN WE TOOK A LOOK AT THE SUNSET REVIEW PROCESS FOUR YEARS AGO I KNOW THAT YOU WERE APPOINTED SUBSEQUENTLY AFTER- AND- JUST SPEAKING VERY PLAINLY ENGLISH THE BOARD WAS A DISASTER. AND IN COMPARISON TO THE OTHER ENTITIES THAT WE HAVE A DEPARTMENT CONSUMER AFFAIRS. AS YOU KNOW THIS PROCESS IS OUR OBLIGATION ON THE OVERSIGHT. ON WHAT WORKS WELL AND WHAT DOESN'T WORK WELL SO AGAIN I COMMEND YOU FOR BEING OPEN TRANSPARENT. AND SPEAKING DIRECTLY TO THESE ISSUES. HAVING SAID THAT LET ME JUST GET STRAIGHT RIGHT INTO THIS THEN TOO BUT- I. AS YOU'VE HEARD FROM AN OF MY COLLEAGUES AND THEY SAID IT AND MUCH MORE ELEGANT WAYS BUT- I SEE AND IT'S- COMPLETE GROSS NEGLIGENCE. AND THE CAPACITY TO HANDLE THIS ISSUE OF SCHOOL APPROVALS. WHAT I HAVE BEFORE ME IS A LIST OF FIFTY FOUR PENDING SCHOOLS ON REFERRALS. AND I UNDERSTAND THAT EVEN IF I'M LOOKING AT THE STATUS THE WAITING LIST. THE DATE OF RECEIPT OF THE FIRST APPLICATION WAS BACK IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. THIS IS STILL PENDING APPROVAL THIS IS FOUR YEARS IN THE MAKING. IS THAT IS THAT ACCURATE TO SAY THAT MY LOOKING AT THE CORRECT DATA. THAT THE STATUS FOR EXAMPLE OF. THE FIRST IN LINE IS STILL THE DATE OF RECEIPT IS STILL BACK IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WHICH WOULD BRING THIS TO FOR YEARS. THIS YAMAGUCHI. YES SIR I'M AFRAID YOU'RE CORRECT OKAY SO. THE NATIONAL ACCREDITORS HAVE A LIMITATION APPROVAL OF THREE YEARS. SO WE ARE BEYOND THAT OF BUT THE NATIONAL STANDARDS ARE. AND EVEN ACCORDING TO YOUR TESTIMONY IN THE ROAD AND IN IN YOUR BACKGROUND PAPER IT'S UP TO THREE YEARS RIGHT YES THEY ESTIMATED TIME FOR APPROVAL IS. NO MORE THAN THREE YEARS IS THAT IS THAT THIS THE CEILING. I'M SORRY. COULD YOU REPEAT THAT PLEASE HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE WHAT IS THE MAXIMUM TIME. FOR SCHOOL TO BE APPROVED. INCOME REGULAR IS NOT A MAXIMUM TIME THERE'S NOT A MAXIMUM TIME OKAY- AND WHAT IT WHAT DO YOU THINK IS A REASONABLE TIME. FOR APPROVAL. I WOULD THINK TWO YEARS TWO YEARS OKAY THANK YOU SO THE NATIONAL CREDITORS HAVE A LIMITATION OF THREE YEARS MAXIMUM. YOU FEEL YOU'VE JUST ADDRESSED IN THIS COMMITTEE THAT HE BELIEVES TWO YEARS IS THAT A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME FOR SCHOOL TO BE APPROVED. AND YET. THE SCHOOL THAT IS NUMBER ONE IN LINE IS STILL BEEN WAITING FOR YEARS THAT IS THAT ACCURATE. YEAH I'M AFRAID YOU'RE CORRECT OKAY. AND SO DO YOU HEARD THAT IT IS OUR OBLIGATION FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ZIP. FOCUS ON THE PIPELINE DEVELOPMENT OF HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS THE FIRST SCHOOL THAT WE SEE LISTED IS IMPERIAL COUNTY. THE SECOND CHOOL IS AN ORANGE COUNTY THE THIRD IN POMONA. THE FOURTH EN EL CENTRO THE FIFTH INTERLOCK THE SIX IN PLACERVILLE THE SEVENTH AND RANCHO CORDOVA THE EIGHTH IN RIVERSIDE. SO BUT I WANT TO UNDERSTAND IS WHERE IS THE SENSE OF URGENCY TO ADDRESS THAT THIS TEXTBOOK EXAMPLE OF RED TAPE WHERE DOES THE BUCK STOPS IN ADDRESSING THIS GROSS INCOMPETENCE DOES IT LIE WITH YOU OR DOES IT LIE WITH THE BOARD. WELL. I WOULD HAVE TO SAY RICE PRESS WITH ME SIR. THANK YOU ELAINE AND AGAIN I DERIVE NO PLEASURE IN HAVING THE DIRECT CONVERSATION AND YOU KNOW I HAVE SURE THIS DIRECTLY ON THE PHONE AS WELL AND- IN ANTICIPATION OF THIS HEARING. AND THEY CANNOT BILL IF THEY TELL ME LIES WITH YOU. AND WE'RE ASLEEP AT THE WHEEL. HOW DO WE RECTIFY THE SITUATION AND HOW WE ENSURE THAT THERE'S ACCOUNTABILITY WHAT IS YOUR RECOMMENDATION ON ACCOUNTABILITY IF WE'VE ALREADY OUTLINED THIS GROSS NEGLIGENCE. OF THESE APPROVAL PROCESS THAT DOESN'T EVEN MEET YOUR TIMELINE AND YOU'RE TAKING OWNERSHIP OF IT. WHAT TYPE OF ACCOUNTABILITY DO YOU RECOMMEND THAT WE AS A LEGISLATIVE BODY. TAKE INTO ACTION. YOUR NUMBERS STEPS IN A NUMBER OF AREAS- ALL WHICH NEED TO BE KIND OF COORDINATEDSOME TO ACT UPON. THIS NEGLIGENCE IF YOU WILL- A LOT OF FACTORS LED TO IT- THERE'S THAT'S NOT AN EXCUSE FOR THE WAY A LOT OF FACTORS LED TO THIS AND LET CERTAINLY TO- THE MUSHROOMING OF THAT OVER THE PAST I WOULD THINK. AM I WOULD SAY EIGHTEEN MONTHS- CERTAINLY STAFFING REVENUE. THE ABILITY TO WORK- AND CERTAINLY LAST YEAR- WHEN THE NEC'S DROPPED EVERYTHING TO WORK WITH THE EXISTING SCHOOLS. AND SPENT PROBABLY MORE THAN CERTAIN THAT THE EXISTING STUDENTS THE EXISTING PROGRAMS. COULD TO THE BEST OF THEIR ABILITIES CONTINUE ON AND IN THE IN THE PAST- BUT- TO MOVE FORWARD- I THINK WE OUTLINED A NUMBER OF. OF POSSIBLE PATHS IN THAT MANNER AND- IDEAS THAT COULD BE ENACTED SOME OF WHICH COULD BE ENACTED RIGHT AWAY- WITH BOARD APPROVAL. SEVERAL WHICH WOULD REQUIRE I THINK SOME STATUTORY AUTHORITY SOME OF WHICH WOULD REQUIRE SOME RULE MAKING. AN ESPECIALLY ALL OF WHICH WOULD REQUIRE THIS BOARD TO BE MORE FISCALLY SOUND- I THINK OUR REVENUE STREAM AS AS I'VE SAID A NUMBER OF TIMES. NEEDS TO BE STABILIZED- I THINK IN TERMS OF THE SCHOOL PROGRAM THREE. I THINK THIS IS A CONTRIBUTING CAUSE TO THE MUSHROOMING OF OUR LIST BECAUSE- BLUNTLY BRN REQUIRES. A PROGRAM TO. THE FULL APPROVAL FEET WITH THIS LETTER OF INTENT AND- THEY-DON'T REALLY HAVE AN APPRECIABLE WAITING LIST BECAUSE THE PROGRAMS WHO ARE READY TO PROPOSE A PROGRAM. OR FAIRLY WELL SITUATED AND HAVE THE READY MISS TO MOVE FORWARD- IN BECAUSE THEY'VE MADE ALREADY A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT. VERY MUCH INCENTIVIZE TO MOVE FORWARD AS QUICKLY AS THEY CAN AND CERTAINLY TO BE AS RESPONSIVE TO THEIR NEC'S- IS A NUMBER OF FACTORS AS I SAID I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT- WE WOULD. ABSOLUTELY WELCOME. DISCUSSIONS WITH WITH THE COMMITTEE AND COMMITTEE STAFF- AND MOVING FORWARD HOW TO PRIORITIZE THIS I THINK THERE'S- THERE'S SOME OTHER UNDERLYING FACTORS AS WELL. AND BUT WE ARE CERTAINLY. READY AND ABSOLUTELY AMENABLE TO RECOMMENDATIONS WE- I THINK- THE COMMITTEE WILL RECALL THAT OUR OUR BOARD UNDERWENT A FAIRLY. DETAILED EXTENSIVE ANALYSIS FIRST WOULD BE ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM- WITH THE POINTED UP ENFORCEMENT MONITOR WHO SUBMITTED- SOME FIFTY ODD RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE BOARD THEM IMPLEMENTED- THEN IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND NINETEEN WE WORK WITH OTHER DEPARTMENTS. IT WAS THEN CALLED OFF THE CHANGE ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE MANAGEMENT IS NOW ORGANIZATIONAL IMPROVEMENT OFFICE- WE HAD INTENDED TELL THE EDUCATION PROGRAMS GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS AS WELL IN TWENTY TWENTY- BUT- UNFORTUNATELY WE'RE NOT ABLE TO DO SO I DO. HAVE A START DATE OF JUNE OF THIS YEAR TO START THAT PROCESS AS WELL SO I THINK THERE'S- THERE'S A NUMBER OF THINGS GOING ON. ALTOGETHER THAT NEED TO BE COORDINATED AND- BUT AS I SAID THERE'S CERTAINLY. ON OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THIS TO THINK THROUGH NEW OPTIONS- I'M CERTAINLY OPEN TO ANY OTHER SUGGESTION I KNOW DOCTOR MOUNTAIN WOULD BE AS WELL- AND THE BOARD NEEDS TO I THINK REALLY STEP BACK AND ASSESS THE- THE WAY WE DO THIS BUSINESS- TO DATE- WE HAVE. THIS LIST HAS BEEN MONITORED- ON ONGOING BASIS AND BUT REALLY THAT THE MONITORING IS YOUR NUMBER THIRTY SOMETHING DO YOU WANT TO STAY ON THE LIST. IT HASN'T BEEN. VERY THE DETAILED THERE HASN'T BEEN LIKE A TRIAGING OR PRIORITIZATION THINK THERE'S- ONE OPPORTUNITY THAT I THINK WE DISCUSSED WITH THE COMMITTEE STAFF IS. WHAT IF WE HAD THE APPROVAL PROCESS MORE FRONT LOADED AND THEN THE INITIAL LETTER INTENT WAS FOLLOWED BY A MUCH MORE DETAILED APPLICATION. UP FRONT WITH NO IDENTIFICATION OF RESOURCES- ASSESSMENT OF REGIONAL NEED- L. VARIETY OF FACTORS THAT WOULD ENABLE US TO STATE RANK YEAH CATIONS THE PROPOSAL SO THAT. WE ARE THEY ARE MOST NEEDED AND CERTAINLY- MOST TURN KEY IF YOU WILL- WOULD HAVE AN ACCELERATED PROCESS. LIKE I SAID THERE'S A NUMBER OF ALL OF OPTIONS AND MEMBER OF- OF CONCEPTS AND I'M CERTAIN THEIR IDEAS THAT WE HAVEN'T THOUGHT OF- BUT AGAIN- I KNOW. IT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE. SO IT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE- OF LANE YOU YOU. AGAIN AS I SUBMIT I WAS HERE THREE YEARS AGO WHEN WE DIDN'T THIS SENSE AT LAST TIME- AND THEN SUBSEQUENT ANDERSON YOUR APPOINTED BACK IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE BOARD WAS IN SUCH A TERRIBLE POSITION. THAT THE BOARD'S AUTHORITY TO HIRE YOU WAS GIVEN TO THE OUT OF THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND SO WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THAT OF THE ACCOUNTABILITY I APPRECIATE YOUR RECOGNITION OF THAT. BUT THE BOARD AND YOURSELF YOU KNEW THAT THIS SUNSET HEARING WAS GOING TO OCCUR. AND YOU KNEW THAT THIS WAS A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM. PRIOR TO THE JUST US HAVING THIS PROCESS AND THAT'S BY THE WAY WHY I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT IMPERATIVE THAT WE HAVE THE SENSE THAT. HEARINGS FOR A NUMBER OF THE BOARDS AND DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS BUT YOU KNEW THIS WAS AN ISSUE AND YOU DIDN'T YOU KNOW THAT THE BOARD BRING IT TO OUR ATTENTION. UNTIL JUST JUST NOW TO TALK ABOUT. HERE THE PROBLEMS. AND IT'S DUE TO LACK OF STAFFING SO THEREFORE WE NEED MORE BUDGET OR THE OR WE STATUTORILY NEED SOME CHANGES. SO BRING IT TO OUR ATTENTION. BUT NOW IT'S YOU'RE REACTING. TO THE SUNSET HEARING TO WHICH NOW WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO. TO CALL THIS OUT. WHY WOULD YOU NOT BE IN A PROACTIVE POSITION TO SAY IT'S MY OBLIGATION AS EXECUTIVE OFFICER TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE. FOCUSED ON THE PIPELINE. AND MAKING. GETTING GETTING RID OF THE RED TAPE SO THAT CALIFORNIA CAN SUPPORT. OUR STUDENT POPULATION AND ENSURING THAT YOU HAVE HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS AND FRONTLINE. WELL WHY DID YOU NOT BRING THAT TO OUR ATTENTION EARLIER AND NOW BUYS IT JUST NOW THAT WE'RE- HAVING A PUBLIC DIALOGUE ON THIS. THAT'S A VERY FAIR. ASSESSMENT SIR- I THINK TO THE BOARD'S DEFENSE- THERE WERE A VAST NUMBER OF FACTORS. THAT WERE. BONFIRE M. SO TWENTY EIGHTEEN TWENTY NINETEEN WERE SPENT PRIORITIZING AND- THE REORGANIZATION AND THE REVITALIZATION OF OUR ENFORCEMENT LICENSING PROGRAMS. AND I THINK AND I WOULD HAVE TO GO BACK AND LOOK FOR CERTAIN. I THINK OF IT AT THAT POINT. THAT WAITING LIST WAS MUCH MORE MANAGEABLE I THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN. SOMEWHERE IN THE TWO DOZEN AREA. AND WE FOUGHT OF COURSE THAT STAFFING WOULD BUT NOT BEING ABLE TO TURN THAT CUSTOMER- I WAS INCORRECT- AGAIN WE THOUGHT TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE ARE FULLY STAFFED WE WOULD BE ABLE TO TURN THAT CORNER AND AGAIN I WAS INCORRECT- SO I DON'T HAVE AN EXCUSE I DON'T HAVE. A REASON PER SE OF NOT FLAGGING THIS AS- AS URGENT AS AN ISSUE AS AS I SHOULD HAVE PERHAPS- BUT THE BOARD'S PRIORITIES WERE TO. ENSURE THAT. THE LICENSING FUNCTIONS SOME WERE BROUGHT INTO ORDER TO FEED FORTUNATE FUNCTIONS WERE BROUGHT INTO ORDER YEAH. THAT'S ABOUT RIGHT FOR NOW. SO EVER ENTERED IN HERE HE SAYS THAT YOU FAILED TO IDENTIFY THAT THIS WOULD INCREASE THE BACKLOG WOULD INCREASE AND THAT YOU FAIL TO TAKE. THE ACTION AS EXECUTIVE OFFICER OFFICER TO ADEQUATELY ADDRESS THIS ISSUE OF THIS BACK WHILE. THAT WOULD BE FAIR SIR. I'M LOOKING AT THE. PROPOSED OF THE SCHOOLS THAT ARE INSIDE THE SCHOOLS THAT HAVE SUBMITTED APPLICATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE THAT I'M LOOKING AT. THE SCHOOL IN RANCHO CORDOVA IRWINDALE. OR LA HABRA OR SALINAS OF COURSE WE WANT TO FOCUS ON THE HARD TO SERVE IN HARD TO REACH AREAS. BUT THESE APPLICATIONS WERE SUBMITTED BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND- TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE EARLIER THIS YEAR TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE. SO WITH THE CURRENT BACKLOG. IF WE JUST DO SOME BASIC MATH. OF WHAT WHAT'S THREE ASSESS WHAT'S YOUR ASSESSMENT OF WERE TO ASK YOU APPROXIMATELY HOW MANY SCHOOLS DO YOU APPROVE A YEAR. BUT THE ANSWER POTS WERE HOW MANY SCHOOLS. CAN WE ASSUME THAT YOU APPROVE EACH YEAR. I WOULD THINK BETWEEN TWENTY AND THIRTY. TWENTY AND THIRTY SCHOOLS A YEAR. I WOULD THINK SO OKAY SO IF I'M IF I IF OF SUBMIT AN APPLICATION BACK IN. TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE. I'LL BE ABLE TO BEAT THAT THAT TIMELINE THAT USS ABOUT. THREE YEARS. UNDER EXISTING STRUCTURE YES PROBABLY THREE YEARS SO AS YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE IS SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES TO THIS AND IT'S OUR DESIRE ESPECIALLY DURING GET RID COMING OUT OF A CODEPENDENT MAKE THAT WE ARE FOCUSED ON THE PIPELINE GETTING FRONTLINE RESPONDERS OUT. IT'S IT SHOULD BE INTERPRETED BY NUMBER OF THE QUESTIONING FROM MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE THAT THAT IS NOT A GOOD SIGN. IF YOU LOOK AT A NUMBER OF THE OTHER BOARDS AND BUREAUS THAT HAVE COME BEFORE HE'S OVERSIGHT HEARINGS. MANY OF THEM GO SEAMLESS WITHOUT. MANY QUESTIONS. BUT THE TEMPTATION OF ALL OF THESE CHALLENGES AND QUESTIONS TO LEAVE YOU TO. THE CONCLUSION THAT THERE IS A LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN YOUR ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY DO YOUR JOB AS WELL AS THE BOARD. IT'S IMPERATIVE THEN THAT WE WILL DO WHAT WE NEED TO DO ON THE POLICY REVOCATIONS HELP EMPOWER YOU BECAUSE WHAT I'M HEARING YOU SAY. IS THAT YOU DO NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY NOR ARE YOU SET UP FOR SUCCESS AND SO BY DEFAULT YOUR SET UP TO FAIL. IF THAT IS THE CASE THEN I WOULD ASK THAT YOU WORK WITH US IN THE LEGISLATIVE BODY TO HELP IMPLEMENT POLICIES SO THAT YOU STATUTORILY CAN BE SET UP FOR SUCCESS. BECAUSE IN MY HEART OF HEARTS I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT YOU WANT TO DO THE BEST THING YOU'RE DOING. AS MUCH AS YOU CAN. BUT IT IS ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THAT YOU ARE NOT- AND SO. THERE'S A DISCONNECT SO LET US TRY TO CONTINUE TO TAKE LOW LEVEL OF SERIOUSNESS IN THE SENSE OF URGENCY ON THESE ISSUES AND HELPING TO INSPIRE CONFIDENCE IN US AND NOT JUST BY CONVERSATION BUT INACTION A BECAUSE WE ARE BEHOLDEN TO THAT OF THE TAX PAYER AND MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC AND WHEN WE HEAR FROM THE SCHOOLS ABOUT THESE ATROCITIES IT'S OUR JOB THAN TO HELP FOCUS AND ADDRESSING THE RED TAPE. AND NOT SEEING THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE THAT WE SEE IN STATE GOVERNMENT SO I WELCOME THAT OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE TO PARTNER WITH YOU AND BEFORE WE GET ANY TO ANY PUBLIC COMMENTS ANY FINAL. THOUGHTS OR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. OKAY SIXTEEN. THEN WE'LL JUST GO TO THE OPERATOR OPERATOR WOULD YOU CUT ME OPEN UP THE LINE.

HI MY NAME IS KOBE PRESIDING WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF PSYCHIATRIC TECHNICIANS- WE REPRESENT ROUGHLY SIX THOUSAND STATE LICENSED- PSYCHIATRIC TECHNICIANS AND APPROXIMATELY- TWELVE THOUSAND SIX AFTER TECHNICIANS THROUGH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS THE PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATION- I WANT TO JUST. BRIEFLY STATE THAT- I THINK- EXECUTIVE OFFICER- AND A TREMENDOUS JOB CONSIDERING WHAT SHE HAS TO WORK WITH AT THE TIME- WORKING DURING THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC AND TRYING TO TRIAGE- SOME OF THE PROGRAMS- AND PRIORITIZE THEM IT IS NO SMALL TASK AND I JUST WANTED TO THANK HER FOR HER EFFORTS- SECONDLY. I THINK PART OF THE REASON WHY- EXECUTIVE OFFICER YAMAGUCHI IS HAVING- SUCH STRUGGLES IS THAT THERE IS NO FEE FOR THE ACCREDITATION PROCESS FOR THE FOR PROFIT INSTITUTIONS- THIS PROHIBITS HER FROM HIRING. MORE STAFF TO DIRECTLY- TRIAGE THIS BACKLOG OF SCHOOLS WAITING ACCREDITATION PROCESS. AND ADDITIONALLY YOU KNOW V. BOARD IS SEEKING REGULATORY AUTHORITY RIGHT NOW TO INCREASE THE FEES ON LICENSE FEES THAT HE IS SUBSIDIZING THE COST OF AND THEIR INSTITUTIONS TO GET ACCREDITED. SO NOT ONLY ARE- STUDENTS PAYING FOR TUITION THEY ARE THEN GOING THROUGH THE LICENSING PROCESS AND THEN PAY A FEE FOR LICENSING. SO IT JUST STRIKES ME AS- COMPLETELY UNFAIR THAT THE LICENSEES ARE SUBSIDIZING THE COST OF FOR PROFIT INSTITUTIONS I THINK SOMETHING COULD BE ESTABLISHED IN WHICH- COMMUNITY COLLEGES COULD HAVE A WAIVER AND THEN NONPROFITS GET OUT A SLIDING FEE SCALE- AND THEN OR PROFIT SET UP A BILLABLE HOUR TYPE SYSTEM ON THE COST THIS LITTLE OUR OF THE BOARD IF YOU HIRE MORE- NURSING- COORDINATORS NURSING EDUCATION COORDINATORS THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT CHALLENGES HAS PASSED.

ARE AND WHERE THEY'RE GETTING AND GIVING US QUARTERLY RESULTS ON SPECIFIC SPECIFIC STUDENTS. OUTCOMES ON THE INFLUX AND ADDS A LITTLE SO WHEN WE SAY THREE YEARS AGO WE HAD VERY LITTLE INSIGHT- INTO OUR VOCATIONAL NURSING STUDENTS.

WE WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT ONE THING THAT MAYBE WE CAN WORK WITH THE BOARD- THE- TESTING FOR IT. WAS GOING TO PUT REGULATIONS YET ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO DEALING WITH. THAT KIND OF LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY THAT NCC'S HAD TO GOVERN THE SCHOOLS WILL BE FOUNDER THE PANDEMIC IS THAT MANY NEC'S ARE SEXUALLY TRYING TO OPERATE THE SCHOOLS THROUGH LETTERS- AND SENDING REQUESTS FOR VOLUMES OF DATA.

I DID IT IS IT WORKING NOW YEAH IF YOU. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN LOW CHAIRMAN ROTH IN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS DR JEFF FOREMAN AND ON SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN AFTER RETIRING FROM DE ANZA COLLEGE AS A FULL TIME INSTRUCTOR FOR THIRTY SIX YEARS I WAS APPOINTED. BY THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE OF COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO REPRESENT COMMUNITY COLLEGES ON THE C. A. M. P. C. BOARD. D. ENDS ARE I FOUNDED AND DIRECTED THE MASSAGE THERAPY PROGRAM THE FIRST 80 DEGREES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE FIRST JACKSON'S OFFICE APPROVED CERTIFICATES IT MASSAGE THERAPY. IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN I WAS ELECTED AS CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD AND- I'D LIKE TO SAY I'M EXTREMELY PROUD OF HOW THE LEGISLATURE HAS ALLOWED CA M. G. C. TO ELEVATE THE MASSAGE THERAPY PROFESSION OUT OF THE SHOWER CHANNELS. TO BEING RECOGNIZED AS ONE OF THE MOST REQUESTED ALTERNATIVE CARE MODALITIES. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WITH ME TODAY AS ARE THE IS THAT YOU. AND IN THE END F TIME. I'D LIKE TO. ALMOST NOT YOU ALLOWS. MAKES MORE LASTING REMARKS. I DON'T THANK YOU GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN LOW CHAIRMAN OFF AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS ALMOST NO CANAL I'M THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE CALIFORNIA MASSAGE THERAPY COUNCIL. MY INVOLVEMENT WITH MASSAGE THERAPY GOES BACK TO MY MILITARY DAYS WHEN I WAS AN ISRAELI PARATROOPER. AND I WAS INJURED IN A COUNTERTERRORIST RAIDS IN LEBANON. PART OF MY RECOVERY INCLUDED WHAT WE NOW ALL KNOW AS MASSAGE THERAPY. MY LIFE WAS CHANGED BY LEARNING FIRSTHAND WHAT THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH. HAS CONCLUDED THAT MASSAGE CAN BE CRITICAL TO THE RELIEF OF PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL PAIN. MASSAGE THERAPY IS LISTED IN CALIFORNIA LAW AS A HEALTHCARE MODALITY AND IT IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE LIVES OF MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS SEEKING PAIN RELIEF MANAGING STRESS AND BRINGING HEALTH AND WELLNESS TO THEIR LIVES. THIS IS MY THIRD SUNSET REVIEW HEARING. THE PREVIOUS HEARINGS WERE HELPFUL IN REFINING OUR MISSION TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC BY VETTING IS CERTIFIED MASSAGE PROFESSIONALS IN CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE ALSO WORKED WITH THIS LEGISLATURE TO ADD THE RESPONSIBILITY OFF APPROVING MASSAGE PROGRAMS THAT MEET THE LEGAL STANDARDS FOR TRAINING AND CURRICULUM. IN MY BRIEF OPENING STATEMENT I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT SEEM TO SEE HAS FOCUSED ON WORKING COLLABORATIVELY WITH STAKEHOLDERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE IN WAYS THAT INCREASE TRANSPARENCY. USTRANSPARENCY INCLUDES HEARINGS TO BAGLEY KEENE OPEN MEETING ACT. THE BOARD THAT IS DIVERSE AND WILLING TO BRING DIFFERENT VIEWS FOR THE DISCUSSION. BRING AN OPEN BOOK TO EXPENDITURES AND PROVIDING CLARITY IN OPERATIONS. ALTHOUGH IT IS SOMETIMES UNAPPRECIATED WE ARE TRANSPARENT REGARDING EDUCATIONAL AND PROFESSIONAL REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE INHERENT. ACCOUNTABILITY THESE LEGISLATURE DEMANDED WHEN THEY ESTABLISH A FIVE OH ONE SEE THREE THEN BRING SENSIBILITY TO THE SAFE AND LEGAL PRACTICE OF MISSILES. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT WHILE THE OVERSIGHT OF MASSAGE THERAPY CAN BE COMPLEX. INDIVIDUAL AND IS CONSTANT SEEM TO SEE DOES NOT TAKE ANY MONEY FROM THE STATE. YOU WILL HEAR TODAY INROADS WE HAVE MADE THROUGH EDUCATIONAL EFFORTS THE SHARING OF INFORMATION WORKING WAS ARE CERTIFICATE HOLDERS GRASSROOTS ORGANIZATIONS. AND IT THE PROTECT THE MOST AFFORDABLE GOVERNING ENTITIES LAW ENFORCEMENT AND DJS WHO BRING. INCREASED ACCOUNTABILITY TO THE MASSAGE INDUSTRY. ENFORCEMENT DOES NOT MAKE US UNIVERSALLY LOT BUT SEEM TO SEE CERTIFICATE OR CERTIFICATES REFLECT FIVE HUNDRED HOURS OF TRAINING FROM VERY GOOD SCHOOLS. IT SEEMS TO SEE SIGNIFICANT SEND A MESSAGE TO CONSUMERS AND EMPLOYERS THAT THE MASSAGE PROFESSIONAL HE'S QUALIFIED TO PROVIDE SAFE AND HEALTHY MASSAGE. CVC IS NO STRANGER TO THE UNDERBELLY PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED FOR TOO LONG WITH MASAK. I EXPECT WE WILL TALK TO DATE OF% PERFORMANCE MEASURES AND HOW WE HAVE CONSISTENTLY OUTPERFORMED TARGETS SINCE OUR LAST HEARING. I ALSO EXPECT WE WILL DISCUSS HOME SEEING TO SEE RESPONDS WITH SIX THIRTY. WHEN A DISCIPLINARY ACTION IS NECESSARY AT A LOW COST THE GOVERNMENT BOARDS CANNOT. WE DO THIS WHILE AT THE SAME TIME PROVIDING FULL AND FAIR DUE PROCESS. OUR STRUCTURE ALLOWS HIM TO SEE TO BE A RECOGNIZED LEADER IN THE BATTLE AGAINST HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND EXPLOITATION. CNBC HAS REMAINED OPEN AND ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN PROVIDING CRITICAL UPDATES DURING THE DIFFICULT YEAR. THAT HAS BEEN SHADOWED BY THE SPEND THEM. IN THE PAST TWELVE MONTHS WE'VE RESPONDED TO THOUSANDS OF QUESTIONS FROM THOSE WE SERVE AND DOES ONE WHO NEEDS CLARIFICATION ON THE ROLE OF MASSAGE THERAPY DURING HIS HEALTH CRISIS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THEY WE'VE EXCEEDED OUR THREE MINUTES FOR THE OPENING REMARKS FROM THE COUNCIL I AM NOW TURNED THE CONVERSATION BACK TO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS AT THIS TIME SO AGAIN QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOLLOWED BY PUBLIC COMMENT SO GOING TO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS AT THIS TIME. OF WILL BEGIN WITH SENATOR LEYVA. THIS THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER LOW RANGE FROM THE SUN. SORRY FULL DIFFERENT FROM THE SENATE A GOOD MORNING THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER LOW I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS ONE IS THE OF THE FINAL POINT OF YOUR TALKING POINTS REGARDING HUMAN TRAFFICKING. AND IN THE FALL THE MASSAGE PARLOR BUSINESS IS THE SECOND MOST COMMON CONTEXT FOR SEX TRAFFICKING AFTER ESCORT SERVICES. MY QUESTION IS HOW DOES THE CURRENT REGULATION OF MASSAGE THERAPY PROFESSION CONTRIBUTE TO STATEWIDE EFFORTS TO COMBAT HUMAN TRAFFICKING. I WOULD BE HORRIFIED TO KNOW THAT I WAS IN THE PROFESSIONS WHERE OF MY PROFESSION WAS THE SECOND LEADING CAUSE OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND FOR ME PERSONALLY I WOULD MAKE THAT A NUMBER ONE PRIORITY TO PUT A STOP TO THAT. SO JUST CURIOUS WHAT YOU ARE DOING TO STOP THAT AND HOW WE CAN PUT A STOP TO THAT. I'M WORRIED TO US K. C. M. D. C. CAN YOU HEAR ME. YES I WOULD I SEEM TO SEE DIRECTOR OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING TO ADDRESS THIS QUESTION. BEVERLY MAY HELLO THIS IS AN EXCELLENT QUESTION E'VE BEEN HONORED BY IT DOESN'T MOVES THAT ARE SENT LETTERS THANK YOU SEE EMPTY SEATS WERE SUPPORT ON THESE ISSUES IN A RECENT REPORT PUBLISHED BY THE SOUTH BAY COALITION AND SHE TRAFFIC INTO THE CHAMPIONS SANTA CLARA ONE OF THE WAYS THAT ILLICIT MASSAGE INDUSTRY CURRENTLY OPERATES WITH LITTLE TO NO REPERCUSSIONS IS BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT BUREAUCRACY. IT WOULD NOT SERVE THE INTERESTS OF THE STATE TO HAVE THE MASSAGE INDUSTRY REGULATED BY ASSISTING ON. CMCC NEED MODEL THAT IN OUR- WITH THE JURISTIC PROVIDED BY STATE LAW WELL WITH THE SENSIBILITY TO OPERATE AS A NONPROFIT. THE BAY AREA ANTI TRAFFICKING COALITION HAS REDUCED ITS C. A. R. T. C.'S WORK QUOTE AS AN EFFECTIVE NONPROFIT IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF MAKING THE VERY SIMPLE MASSAGE INDUSTRY SAFE PLACE OWNERS THEIR ARTISTS AND CLIENTS. JOHN MANNING WAS THE FIRST UNION TRAFFICKING OFFICE IN SAN JOSE AND IS CURRENTLY THE HUMAN TRAFFICKING COORDINATOR SAN DIEGO COUNTY. YOU DON'T HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE ALL COMMENTS TODAY. JOHN IS A NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED EXPERT ON THE SUBJECT. HE SAID C. A. M. P. C. ONLY EXPERT MACHINE TRAFFICKING. AND HAS ENCOURAGED US TO EXPLAIN LEADERSHIP IN THIS ARENA. THE CURRENT ROUND REGULATION OF THE MASSAGE THERAPY PROFESSION MASSAGE PROGRAMS IS WELL RECOGNIZE. BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AS WELL AS HUMAN TRAFFICKING ORGANIZATIONS IT GETS RIGHT INTO THE PARADIGM OF PREVENTION PROTECTION PROSECUTION AND% PARTNERSHIPS. THAT MAKE UP AN INTERNATIONAL FRAMEWORK USED BY THE UNITED STATES AND THE WORLD TO COMBAT TRAFFIC. CMT'S PLACE YOU NEED ROLE. CHAU SEN BURKE EVERY TV TO SEARCH ALL. THE EDUCATE THEM ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE ENTERPRISE PROVIDING CONTACTS TO THOSE WHO MAY INDEED IT TELLS. CMT C. HAS AND CONTINUES TO TRAIN LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS ON SCENE TRAFFICKING AND OTHER. CRIMES SUCH STREET. CMCC HASH AND EARNS ARCTIS SOUND HUMAN TRAFFICKING OPERATIONS IN THE STATE INCLUDING ARMS ACROSS CLARA SAN MATTEO VENTURA COUNTY'S. WORKING CLOSELY WITH VICTIM SERVICE PROVIDERS THAT DIRECTLY SERVE THIS POPULATION CMT C. SUPPORTS OUTREACH TO HELP PROTECT POTENTIAL VICTIMS UNDERSTAND THEIR OPTIONS INCLUDING THE POSSIBILITY OF FALLING BEHIND AND SALAS. SOUTH STE. CMT'S IS DIRECTLY. I'LL BE IMPLEMENTED BEST PRACTICES- CENTER CONSCIOUS THESE REASONS. TRAFFICKING ORGANIZATIONS COALITIONS COLLABORATIVES IN TASK FORCES THROUGHOUT THE STATE WELCOME PARTNERSHIPS WITH CMT C. IN FACT SOME OF THE REQUIREMENTS AND LOCAL MASSAGE REGULATIONS AND MOST BURDENS. TO THE GENERAL OPERATORS HAVE IN THE PAST NINETY NINE EASILY PROMOTED BISON TRAFFICKING ORGANIZATIONS THEMSELVES THESE REGIONAL AND NATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS COME TO APPRECIATE PARTNERING WITH CA NTC EXPERTISE AND EXPERIENCE AND BEST PRACTICES THAT DO NOT HARM THE PROFESSIONALS SUCH. MISS MISS VERY MICE BUT MY PLUG FOR DRUG PREP SO WHICH TO GET TO THE QUESTION FROM SENATOR LEYVA SPECIFICALLY I APPRECIATE THAT YOU HAVE A STANDARD RESPONSE WITH RESPECT TO HUMAN TRAFFICKING BUT I THINK CENTER CENTER LEYVA PRESSURE CAN REFINE YOUR QUESTION. YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER LOW YES I APPRECIATE THE RESPONSE TO BECAUSE YOUR SPOTS RESPONSE MAKES IT SOUND LIKE EVERYTHING IS WONDERFUL AND ROSIE AND IT'S NOT YOUR IN YOUR YOUR- F THE MATC. AND MASSAGE PARLORS ARE NUMBER TWO IN SEX TRAFFICKING IF ONE PERSON IS SEX TRAFFICKED YOU'RE FAILING SO HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT NO ONE IS BEING SEX TRAFFICKED IN THE MASSAGE THERAPY INDUSTRY I HEARD YOU SAY THAT YOU DON'T WANT STATE REGULATION. AND YOU NEED THAT FLEXIBILITY BUT IF THERE IS ONE PERSON AD THERE ARE PROBABLY A LOT MORE THAN ONE PERSON BEING SEX TRAFFICKED THEN MAYBE STATE REGULATION IS NEEDED SO I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING SPECIFICALLY TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY MASSAGE PARLOR. IS NOT TRAFFICKING. IN HUMANS FOR SEX. FIRST I'D LIKE TO START BY TYLER THAT SUCH PARLOR IS A LITTLE BIT OF AN OUTDATED TERM. SITTARD IT'S DISLIKED BY THE MASSAGE PROFESSION. BUT- THIS IS A- NATIONWIDE PROBLEM AND IT'S EXIST IN STATES WITH THE MOST STRINGENT REGULATIONS. ON THE WAY THAT- SLOT ONE WAY THAT FLORIDA DEALS WITH IT IS BY. BY REQUIRING PROOF OF CITIZENSHIP WHEN THE GOVERNMENT'S MASSAGE ESTABLISHMENT THE COMPLICIT DOWN IF PEOPLE DON'T HAVE PROOF OF THE RIGHT TO WORK. IN NEW YORK IT'S A CLASS C. FELONY TO BE WORKING. WITH AND WITHOUT A STATE LICENSE IN THE STATE WHICH MEANS OR WAS DOWN C. M. D. C. HAS DONE A WONDERFUL JOB WITH. THE WITH THE CONVENTION. HARD BY. WHY OF NO LONGER RECOGNIZE OVER HOW SCHOOLS THAT WERE FRAUDULENTLY SELLING ART ALSO FIND TRANSCRIPTS. AND I THINK THIS IS HAS BEEN PASSED. YOU TAPPED AS WELL AS TRAINING LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ORDERED FORSMAN I WANT TO LOOK. THE SEATTLE C. M. A. THREE HAVE ANY KIND OF STATISTICS TO HAVE ANY IDEA OF ALL OF THE MASSAGE THERAPY. PLACES OF BUSINESS I'M TRYING TO BE MORE APPROPRIATE- ANY IDEA HOW MANY ARE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND HOW MANY YEARLY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH HUMAN BEINGS TRAFFICKED IN SEX. BOB SENATOR- I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE JUST TO FRAME- FRAME DAVE- DAY GENERAL INFORMATION IT WAS- THE LEGISLATION THAT. RAPTURED ARE DEREGULATION SUCH A WAY THAT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT CONTROL ESTABLISHMENT SEEING BECAUSE HE DOES NOT REGULATE ESTABLISHMENTS WE VETERANS CERTIFIED THE INDIVIDUAL THERAPIST AND WE HADN'T A CLUE OUR SCHOOLS- DAY ESTABLISHMENTS HE'S UNDER THE CONTROL OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT. SO MAYBE WE NEED FOR LOCAL CONTROL AND MORE STRINGENT RULES AND LAWS THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO MAKE SURE THIS ISN'T HAPPENING AT ANY ESTABLISHMENTS. SEEM D. C. HAVE ALWAYS SUPPORTED LOCAL CONTROL WHEN IT COME TO THE WAY CITIES AND COUNTIES- OUR REGULATING BUSINESSES. JUST TO KEEP THINGS IN PERSPECTIVE WE HAVE A VERY ROBUST I REPRESENTATION ON CMT C. BOARD FROM A LOCAL GOVERNMENT. WE HAVE AN APPOINTEE OF THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES WITH THEIR FIVE CHILDREN SEEM TO SEE A PLENTY OF BAY COUNTIES- SO WE WORK VERY CLOSELY- WAS LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THEM AND WE FULLY SUPPORT- CITIES AND COUNTIES CONTROLLING THEIR- THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES. OKAY AND HOW DO YOU HOW WOULD YOU FEEL ABOUT MORE STATE REGULATION. SO THAT WE CAN MAKE THE I I'M SORRY BUT I'M JUST VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT THIS I DON'T THINK THAT ANYONE SHOULD BE TRAFFICKED AND USED FOR SEX AND WE KNOW THAT IT HAPPENS TO WOMEN AND YOUNG WOMEN. AND IF YOU'RE IN A BUSINESS WHERE THIS IS HAPPENING HOW DO WE PUT A STOP TO THAT I UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT MASSAGE THERAPY YES THEY CAN BE EXTREMELY HELPFUL AND BENEFICIAL TO PEOPLE BUT IF THERE ARE NEFARIOUS PEOPLE WHO ARE USING THIS FOR OTHER PURPOSES. THEN HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN IF LOCALLY THE ARE THE RESTRICTIONS ARE NOT TIGHT ENOUGH THEN MAYBE WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING AT THE STATE LEVEL SO THAT THAT WAY THIS JUST DOES NOT HAPPEN THIS THIS PRACTICE DOES NOT HAPPEN THERE ARE BAD ACTORS IN ANY. IN THE INDUSTRY BUT IN THIS THESE BAD ACTORS RUIN PEOPLE'S LIVES. IF YOU. WE ARE ALWAYS OPEN TO SIT DOWN WITH THE COMMITTEE AND TO DISCUSS ANY IDEAS- THAT CAN ADDRESS THIS- TERRIBLE PROBLEM I SEEM TO SEE WHAT BUT SEEM TO SEE DOCTOR READY ARE PRODUCED TREMENDOUS RESULTS IN REDUCING- THE SITUATION IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE'RE VERY OPEN TO ANY IDEAS THE ANYBODY THAT. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH HAVE ONE OTHER QUESTION MISTER CHAIR FOR ME AND I'M SORRY I SOUND LIKE I'M BEING VERY A NEGATIVE TODAY BUT I JUST HAD A QUESTION- MISTER CEO ABOUT YOUR COMPENSATION THREE HUNDRED FORTY SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS THIS SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF MONEY I KNOW THAT YOU DON'T TAKE ANY STATE MONEY- BUT YOU I BELIEVE YOUR COMPENSATION IS COMPLETELY. PAID FOR THROUGH THE FEES THAT PEOPLE PAY THROUGH CA MTP AND I'M JUST WONDERING IF I'M JUST WONDERING WHY YOU NEED THAT MUCH MONEY TO DO YOUR JOB. ANYTHING THAT HAS TO DO IS THAT A CEO COMPENSATION IS BEING GOVERNED BY THE BOARD. AND I'M GONNA ASK THIS SEEM TO SEE VICE CHAIR DR ON BATES TO ADDRESS THIS. WHILE WORKING FOR THEM TO KEEP I WOULD JUST SAY THIS I USED TO I'M IN MY OLD JOB FOR RAN FOR OFFICE I HAD A BOARD AS WELL. AND I THINK IT'S A VERY EASY TO OUT TO SAY THAT IT IS GOVERNED BY THE BOARD. I WAS THE ONE WHO WHO'S IN WHAT Y. BOARD WANTED TO COMPENSATE ME I'M SURE IT WAS ALWAYS FAIR AND IN LINE WITH WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE REST OF THE INDUSTRY. SO I THINK IT'S EASY TO BLAME IT ON THE BOARD BUT IF THE BOARD WANTS TO GIVE YOU AN INCREASE. HE WAS A AS YOU CAN SAY NO I THINK THAT IT'S I DON'T NEED THIS MONEY TO PAY. THIS MUCH MONEY TO DO MY JOB. FIRST OF ALL MISTER IN MY HOME. OKAY THIS IS WHAT THIS IS RIGHT BATES- I'M VICE CHAIR OF THE BE- CAMTEK BOARD AND I REPRESENT THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES ON THE BOARD I HAVE OVER FIFTY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE ALL RIGHT DIDN'T LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE IN A SENSE THE CITY MANAGER IN VARIOUS CITIES AND AS A LOCALLY ELECTED OFFICIAL AND MAYOR OF MY PHD HAPPENS TO BE R. IN PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION WITH A SPECIALTY IN FINANCE. M. I WAS THE BOARD MEMBER THAT REQUESTED THE COMPENSATION STUDY FOR THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR SO THAT WE COULD ESTABLISH A SALARY THAT WAS FAIR AND EQUITABLE THEN NO BOARD CHAIRMAN DID MYSELF MARC DIXON CONSTITUTED A COMPENSATION COMMITTEE WE INTERVIEWED DEL FOR NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED FIRMS TO DO THE COMPENSATION STUDY. CBS WAS SELECTED BECAUSE OF THEIR BACKGROUND OF DOING COMPENSATION STUDIES FOR NONPROFITS AND VERY COMPLEX ORGANIZATIONS C. BIZ IS A NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED CONSULTING AND ACCOUNTING FIRM FOUR THOUSAND EMPLOYEES THAT BILLION DOLLARS IN REVENUE- NINETY THOUSAND CLIENTS A HUNDRED OFF THIS IS IN THE UNITED STATES AND IS TRADED ON THE NEW YORK STOCK STAGE AS YOU CAN UNDERSTANDA VERY CAPABLE OF BURKE AS MENTIONED CAMP TAKE GIVES A VERY COMPLEX ORGANIZATION THAT CA ALMOST DEAL EFFECTIVELY. WITH D. A. SHARE POLICE CHIEFS THE LETTER FACIALS AT ALL LEVELS AND THEIR STAFF ASKED CODE ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS MASSAGE SCHOOLS WITH THE EXTRA TICKET HOLDERS THEMSELVES AND MANY OTHER STATE AGENCIES AROUND THE COUNTRY TO NAME A FEW IF THE JOB IS TWENTY FOUR SEVEN AND COMPENSATION SHE NEEDS TO BE. SET WHICH IS FAIR TO CAMP CHECK AND IT'S. A DIFFICULT WILDER'S- BUT ALSO. I ARE RIGHT. IN THE APPROACH. OVER PAY. BUT THE- HAS BE FAIR TO ME. OF WELLQUALIFIED- C. E. O. OF FOR A LITTLE MORE DETAILS SO WE DON'T NECESSARILY AND I UNDERSTAND YOUR QUESTION WAS FULL OKAY STOP ARE MOST- BUT SENATOR I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SUGGEST THAT WE HEAR FROM YEAH. A LOT TODD SHE'S A MANAGER DIRECTOR OF CPOS WHO LET THIS STUDY'S GOT TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF EXPERIENCE HAS WRITTEN A BOOK CALLED REASONABLE COMP. STATION A SPECIALIST APPROACH AND I THINK TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE MORE DETAILS. AS TO HOW IT WAS DEVELOPED AND THEN HELD THE BOARD CONSIDERED OF FAIR COMPENSATION FOR THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR SO WITH THAT MAYBE- WELL- ALMOST COULD ADDRESS IT THANK YOU I DON'T WANT TO BELABOR THE POINT BUT I WOULD JUST SAY THAT IN MY NOTES- THE- MEDIAN SALARY FOR AN EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR IN THIS POSITION IS A HUNDRED AND SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. THAT'S WHAT I MADE LAST YEAR AS A AS A STATE SENATOR MY SALARY WAS A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND I WOULD ARGUE THAT I REPRESENT A MILLION PEOPLE I HAVE TO MAINTAIN A RESIDENCE THE TWO PARTS OF THE STATE I WORK TWENTY FOUR SEVEN AS WELL. BUT AND I THINK THAT I'M A VERY EFFECTIVE SENATOR AND I THINK I REPRESENT THE STATE OF MY CONSTITUENT VERY WELL AND I'M NOT PAID 300-606-4000 DOLLARS A YEAR SO I'M JUST MAKING THE POINT. THAT MANY PEOPLE WORKS TWENTY FOUR SEVEN MANY PEOPLE DEAL WITH ALL THE ENTITIES THAT YOU SPOKE ABOUT. THAT AND ARE PAID ENCOMPASSES. THE THING I'M- HIS SALARY COULD BE HIT SO CAREER. AS SOME OF THAT MONEY COULD BE USED TO MAKE SURE THAT NO ONE IS SEX TRAFFIC. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU REPRESENTATIVE I JUST A FALL THE QUESTION BY SEN ROTH FROM MYSELF AND THEN BY SOME MEMBER CUNNINGHAM. HE WILL BE. OKAY YEAH I DID JUST ON THAT IT BECAUSE OF IT WAS BROUGHT THAT UP ON ON THE ON THE CONVERSATION I'D BE CURIOUS TO GET GET FEEDBACK ESPECIALLY FROM THE COUNCIL ON BUT THIS IS FOR COLLEAGUES THIS ON PAGE TWENTY THREE. OF THE- OF THE- THE BACKGROUND PAPER. AT WITH RESPECT TO COMPENSATION ON COMPATIBLES. ARE YOU REFERENCED EARLIER ABOUT- DOING AN ANALYSIS A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS WITH OTHER. ENTITIES OF UP FOR COMPENSATION- BUT THIS IS A REGULATORY ENTITY THE OTHER. ORGANIZATIONS THAT YOU USE FOR COMPATIBLES OUR TRADE ASSOCIATIONS LIKE THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE THE MEDICAL ASSOCIATION- FOR EXAMPLE- WITH LICENSEES THAT ARE MAKING EASILY OVER SIX FIGURES. L.A. AND THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WITH FORTUNE FIVE HUNDRED COMPANIES CAN HELP US UNDERSTAND AS TO WHY. THESE ARE NOT BE INTERPRETED AS APPLES AND ORANGES. MAYBE TO THE BOARD VICE CHAIR. OKAY. I'M SORRY BABY OKAY AND MAKE YOURSELF TIMELY. WHERE ANYONE IS WITH IT WOULD HAVE WHAT A BOARD MEMBER WILL WISH TO RESPOND. ANY OF THE BOARD MEMBERS. WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO REPEAT THE QUESTION THAT HELPFUL. WE'LL SENATE. RATA WITH WITH CIBA'S I WITH THE CONSULTANT THAT HELPED WORK ON THE ANALYSIS STE I'D BE HAPPY TO RESPOND- ABOUT THE PROTOTYPES LIKE SOME OF OUR MEMBERS MAY BE HAVING DIFFICULTY- SPLIT WITH THE WEB ALL. WOULD THAT BE HELPFUL. YES AGAIN THE QUESTION IS IF YOU YOU I HEARD EARLIER FROM THE BOARD MEMBER. WITH YOUR ON THE QUESTION OF. ARTICULATION AND THE VALUE OF THE COMPENSATION AND ART WE HEARD EARLIER. THAT THERE WAS A STUDY A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS THAT WAS DONE. BUT COULD IT I DIDN'T COVER THAT IT'S APPLES AND ORANGES BECAUSE SOME OF THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT I AS I UNDERSTAND IT AND CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG. BUT WE'RE YOU TRADE ASSOCIATIONS NOT A REGULATORY ENTITY LIKE THAT MASSAGE THERAPY COUNCIL AND USING COMPARISON TO THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. OR THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. OF WHICH AGAIN FOR MEDICAL ASSOCIATION ITS LICENSEES ARE EASILY MAKE SIX FIGURES PLUS AND THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE DEALING WITH EXECUTIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH. A MILLION DOLLAR COMPANIES AND FORTUNE FIVE HUNDRED COMPANIES. WITH A WITH THE OBLIGATION TO ITS SHAREHOLDERS NOT ITS TAXPAYERS AND RUNNER AND- LICENSEES CAN YOU HELP US UNDERSTAND AS TO WHY THESE TRADE ASSOCIATIONS WERE USED FOR COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS. SURE SO I MAY ARE PROBABLY AN INCH OR MORE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS THAT CERTAINLY WOULD BE HAPPY TO ADDRESS BECAUSE- I'M FROM A BIG PICTURE PERSPECTIVE. UP THEY ARE A BIBLE C. THREE ORGANIZATION. AND THAT'S PART OF THAT THERE ARE SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS FROM THE IRS IS BEING PART OF A BIBLE ONE TWO THREE. RELATED TO EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION- CAN BE FOUND IN THE IRC. FORTY NINE FIFTY EIGHT THE FIELD INTERMEDIATE SANCTIONS- AND IS LESS THE SPECIFIC TYPES OF DATA THAT SHOULD BE USED. WHEN COMPARING EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION IT SPECIFICALLY LAST OTHER BIBLE ONE SEE THREE- OR OTHER NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS AS APPROPRIATE COMPARISONS AND SO IN ORDER TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH. FRANKLY IRS REQUIREMENTS WE WILL LOOK AT THOSE OTHER ORGANIZATIONS BUT- THAT'S THE COMPLIANCE WITH IDEA TO LET LET ME ASK. ANSWER FROM A MORE. MARK BASED- KA. ACROSS IN THAT IS WHEN YOU LOOK AT EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION YOU TEND TO SEE THE STRONGEST CORRELATION BETWEEN THE SIZE OF AN ORGANIZATION AND CEO OR EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR COMPENSATION SO YOU'D EXPECT THE CEO OF A TEN BILLION COMPANY TO EARN MORE THAN THE CEO OF A TEN MILLION DOLLAR COMPANY ALL ELSE BEING EQUAL. AND SO AS WE IDENTIFIED THE CURES FOR COMPARISON OUR FOCUS WAS ON LOOKING AT OTHER NONPROFITS WE'RE LOOKING AT BECAUSE WESTERN A CALIFORNIA BASED AS WE COULD FROM A GEOGRAPHIC PURPOSES REALLY THE FOCUS WAS ON BOTH SIDES OF THOSE ORGANIZATIONS BY LOOKING AT THE SIZE OF STAFF. TO SAY HEY THIS IS A LARGE ORGANIZATION ARE VERY ORGAN. HOW DO FIND THE MOST COMPARABLE- ORGANIZATIONS IN TERMS OF SIZE OR COMPARISON. BUT THAT WAS JUST ONE PIECE OF THE ANALYSIS THAT YOUR NONPROFIT ALSO WE LOOKED AT SPECIFIC NONPROFIT PEERS. WE ALSO LOOKED AT PUBLISHED SALARY SURVEY DATA SO AS A FIRM WE SPEND UPWARDS OF A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR ON COMPENSATION SALARY SURVEY DATA AND SO WE'RE ABLE TO LOOK LIKE INDUSTRY GEOGRAPHY AND SIZE OF ORGANIZATION I'M FROM PUBLISHED SALARY SURVEYS AS WELL. FINALLY IT AND CERTAINLY I CAN HELP WITH THAT I'VE BEEN TO MORE DETAIL- THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL- BUT IT'S IMPORTANT OUT. APPLES APPLES COMPARISONS I'M SO I SAW REFERENCE THE HUNDRED SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLAR BASED HEY- I'M NOT. HAVE NOT DONE A DEEP DIVE ON THE BENEFITS THAT ARE AVAILABLE FOR THOSE POSITIONS- BUT- WITHIN THIS ORGANIZATION. LAURIE AS WELL AS TOTAL CASH COMPENSATION BENEFITS TOTAL COMPENSATION IT'S ALL ON THE SAME THERE ARE NO BENEFITS NO RETIREMENT. THANKS SO IT'S IMPORTANT WE UNDERSTAND. THE TOTAL VALUE OF COMPENSATION AS OPPOSED TO HAVING OUT. IN APPLE INC BASED FAKE COMPARED TO AN ORANGE IN TOTAL COMPENSATION. SO WITH THAT AGAIN HAPPY TO DIVE INTO ANY SPECIFICS- AND AS- I WOULD BE REQUESTED. THANK YOU I KNOW THIS IS A BECAUSE A GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY- BY THE BEGINNING THAT THIS IS A REGULATORY AS WELL WHICH IS THE CASE WHERE IN WHICH YEARS BEFORE US RIGHT NOW. THE AVERAGE EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION IS A HUNDRED AND SEVEN AND IF WE LOOK AT THAT FOR EXAMPLE OF LICENSEES OR CERTAIN THOSE WHO ARE CERTIFIED IF THE AVERAGES. THIRTY DOLLARS AN HOUR. THE AVERAGE A CERTIFIED THERAPIST WHAT WHAT THE AVERAGE COMPENSATION THIRTY DOLLARS AN HOUR. WAS THAT ON THE HIGH END. ANYONE. AGAIN THESE ARE NOT LICENCES CURRENTLY THE THESE ARE THOSE WHO ARE CERTIFIED MASSAGE THERAPIST. WHAT IS THE AVERAGE COMPENSATION. FOR A CERTIFIED MASSAGE THERAPIST. I'M NOT SURE YOU'RE ASKING A QUESTION TO ASK IT ANYONE WHO'S TO TELL ANYONE. ANY VERY HIGH I DON'T HAVE THAT DATA BUT THIRTY DOLLARS AN HOUR DOESN'T DOESN'T SOUND OUTRAGEOUS AS THE BIRDS OBSERVE DISCUSSION OKAY SO PURPOSE OF DISCUSSION. IF AVERAGE CERTIFIED MASSAGE THERAPIST IS MAKING THIRTY DOLLARS AN HOUR AND THEY EXECUTIVE OFFICER AS AN 8% AUTOMATIC INCREASE. 8% AUTOMATIC INCREASE IN WHICH THAT WAS GRANTED THIS YEAR. NEVER MIND OUT OF THE COPA PANDEMIC IN THOSE WHO MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO DO IN PERSON. SERVICES BUT AUTOMATIC 8% INCREASE. BUT THE BENEFITS TOTALING THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS IS IT APPROPRIATE. FOR AN EXECUTIVE OFFICER. TO BE COMPENSATED AT THREE HUNDRED FORTY SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS BUT AVERAGE CERTIFIED THERAPIST IS MAKING THIRTY DOLLARS AN HOUR. I'M SORRY I GUESS COUPLE THINGS JUST TO CLARIFY IT SO I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE AUTOMATIC 8% INCREASE I CAN'T TALK MUCH ABOUT- I'M NOT ALONE BUT YOU'D SAID THAT. YOUR BENEFITS WAS THREE HUNDRED AND SOME ODD THOUSAND DOLLARS IN SUPPORT OF THE VALUE OF BENEFITS AT XEROX I GREW UP TOTAL COMPENSATION. WELL ACT. OF BUT MAYBE JUST APPROPRIATE YOU. EDWARD BUT AGAIN I THINK THE BIGGER EVERY NOTICING SOMETHING THAT'S COMPLETELY TONE DEAF THE BOARD INCREASED FEES THIS YEAR FOR CERTIFICATION TO ITS CERTIFIED SERVICE YOU JUST INCREASED FEES THE FEE INCREASE. AND DURING THE COVERED PANDEMIC YOU HAVE CERTIFIED THERAPISTS WERE UNABLE TO WORK AND YET THE CEO COMPENSATION HAS THE AUTOMATIC INCREASE OF 8% EVERY YEAR. AND IT'S OUTSTANDING THAT ITSELF CURRENTLY AT THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT'S THAT THAT'S WHERE I THINK WE'RE GETTING AN AND WE MAY BE HIGHLIGHTING AGAIN ON PAGE TWENTY THREE OF THE- ISSUE RAISED A NUMBER THREE STAFF COMPENSATION. THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE. AND IT JUST APPEARS TO ME THAT. WE CAN'T CHERRY PICK. WELL WE'RE REGULATORY ENTITY BUT THEN WE'RE ALSO NONPROFIT SO WHAT WOULD YOU CAN CHERRY PICK THE BENEFITS OF BEING NONPROFIT. AND THEN CHERRY PICK THE REGULATORY SIDE AND THEY'RE NOT GETTING ANY OF THE OTHER TYPE OF. CRITICAL. TYPE OF SCRUTINY ACCOUNTABILITY- BUT THOSE ARE JUST MY INITIAL COMMENTS HAD A SENSE OF A PRINT PRODUCT. YOUR YES HELLO JUST BEFORE YOUR INFORMATION I SEEM TO SEE BOARD DID NOT INCREASE ANY FEES THIS YEAR- IN THE ELEVEN YEARS SIMPLY SEE EXIST HE'S WERE INCREASED ONLY ONE TIME AND I BELIEVE THAT WAS IN LINE IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN DOES THAT MEAN CAME OUT OF THE INFORMATION IN FRONT OF ME- A IN WHAT THE BORDER. AND HE'S ON STOP. IN THE PAST TWELVE MONTHS CNBC WAVE COMPLETELY ALL OF ITS LATE FEES- TO ALLOW SECURITYHOLDERS MORE TIME TO RECERTIFY IF THEY NEED MORE TIME AND WAVE COMPLETELY- ALL OF THOSE FEES. ARE ALSO- YEAH I WOULD LIKE TO THE BORDER DRESS THAT I WOULD JUST ALSO WOULD LIKE TO SHARE WITH THE CENTER A CENTER LIVE YEAH DEAD LAST YEAR WITHOUT BEING ASKED I INITIATED A DEFERRAL ON MY COMPENSATION TO THE TUNE OF ALMOST SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS- BECAUSE WE'RE VERY CONCERNED OFFICE FINANCES A AND- SO I INITIATED THESE- DEFERRAL LAST YEAR- AND IN REGARD TO THE INCREASED THERE IS NO AUTOMATIC INCREASE I'M NOT SURE WHERE THAT INFORMATION CAME FROM. THE BOARD IS IN COMPLETE CONTROL ARM OFF ANY INCREASE- DEBT THIS YEAR OKAY. THANK YOU OF JUST FIVE TO CLARIFY THAN I AYES IN THE BACK PAPER A VERBATIM A YEAR IT SAID THAT THERE WAS NO INCREASE AT APPRECIATE THAT'S A BABY COULD CLARIFY. I HAVE HEE ON PAGE ELEVEN BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE INCREASE IN OPERATING EXPENSES CAN TECH INCREASED ITS FEES WITH ITS INITIAL APPLICATION AND RECERTIFICATION FEES RAISED FROM A HUNDRED AND FIFTY. TO TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN IS THAT INACCURATE IN YOUR- IN THE BACKGROUND PAPER. I DON'T HAVE THE INFORMATION FROM IT COULD BE EITHER TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. AND WHEN IT COMES TO FEES- LET'S JUST KEEP IN MIND THAT. THE LEGISLATOR SET UP OF FEET OF WATER SEEM TO SEE WAS INITIALLY CREATED THERE WAS NO FEE LIMITS SEEM TO SEE BOARD WAS ABLE TO CHARGE- ANY FEE THAT- IT IT'S ALL FAIR. THE BOARD IS VERY SENSITIVE TO THE ISSUE OF IMPORTANCE OF KEEPING FEES LOCK DOWN THAT IS WHY THEY CHARGE ONLY A HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS. A INDOOR NO INCREASING FEES FOR YEARS THERE'S ONLY ONE TIME INCREASING FEAR GUESS. TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. FROM ONE FIFTY TO TWO HUNDRED. AND SO THE BOARD IS VERY SENSITIVE THIS ISSUE. EVEN THOUGH IN A SUBSEQUENT SUNSET REVIEW THE LEGISLATURE CREATED THE CEILING OF THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS AND THE BOARD COULD HAVE CHARGED MORE STEEL THE- I'VE DECIDED TO KEEP IT FEES BELOW THE THRESHOLD THAT- THE LEGISLATURE. SO WE ALWAYS DO WHATEVER WE CAN TO FEET TO KEEP FEES AS LOW AS POSSIBLE OKAY JUST FOR JUST A PUBLIC RECORD TO YOU PREVIOUSLY STATED THAT THERE WAS NO FEE INCREASE IN THE PAST. ARE WITHIN THE LAST PAST ELEVEN YEARS BUT WE JUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I'M SAID THEY SAID THERE WAS ONE TIME INCREASE OKAY. AT ONE TIME WAS IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN. I BELIEVE THAT'S CORRECT. OKAY SO THE- OF WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS THAT THERE IS A THERE HAS BEEN A FEE INCREASE- RECOGNIZING AS YOU HAVE SEEN IN A NUMBER OF THESE. OVERSIGHT HEARINGS THAT. THE COMMITTEE IS SENSITIVE TO FEE INCREASES AND SO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE WE CLARIFIED THAT AS WELL BUT BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT. THERE'S A QUESTION BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER CUNNINGHAM. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I WANT TO GET BACK TO THE HUMAN TRAFFICKING ISSUE FOR A MOMENT. ACCORDING TO POLARIS DOT ORG A NONPROFIT THAT TRACKS HUMAN TRAFFICKING ACROSS THE WORLD. THERE ARE. AN ESTIMATED OVER NINE THOUSAND MASSAGE. PARLORS I UNDERSTAND PARLOR ISN'T THE TERM YOU GUYS PREFER SAW CALL THEM MASSAGE FACILITIES. OVER NINE THOUSAND MASSAGE FACILITIES IN THE UNITED STATES INVOLVED IN HUMAN TRAFFICKING- CALIFORNIA HAS MORE OF THOSE FACILITIES THAN ANY OTHER STATE- BOTHIN ABSOLUTE TERMS AND PER CAPITA. ACCORDING AGAIN TO POLARIS DOT. WORK. IT OCCURS TO ME- I UNDERSTAND YOUR ARGUMENT THAT YOU MADE IN RESPONSE TO A PREVIOUS QUESTION. THAT YOU DON'T WANT STATE OVERSIGHT THAT YOU DON'T NECESSARILY WANT STATE LICENSURE- I'M SYMPATHETIC TO THAT AS A STARTING POINT- THE ARGUMENT COULD BE SUMMARIZED THAT YOU MADE AS IF IT AIN'T BROKE DON'T FIX IT. BUT I THINK THE MESSAGE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO CONVEY TO YOU TODAY IS THAT. WHEN IT COMES TO. REGULATING AND IDENTIFYING AND STOPPING HUMAN TRAFFICKING WHICH WITHIN THE MASSAGE. IT IS BROKE. WHAT YOU ARE DOING NOW IS INSUFFICIENT. AND YOU NEED TO FIX IT OR I BELIEVE THE STATE WILL BE FIXING IT FOR YOU. SO I FIRST WANT TO CONVEY THAT MESSAGE AND PERHAPS MORE PLAINSPOKEN TERMS. A WHEN YOU HAVE OVER NINE THOUSAND NATIONWIDE A GREAT MAJORITY THOSE ARE A GOOD PERCENTAGE OF THAT IN CALIFORNIA- YOU HAVE A PROBLEM. IN YOUR INDUSTRY PERIOD. HUMAN TRAFFICKING IS THE FASTEST GROWING FROM A ENTERPRISE IN THE WORLD TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY ESTIMATED WORLDWIDE IT'S HAPPENING CALIFORNIA MORE THAN ANYWHERE ELSE AND WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT NOW. WE NEED YOUR HELP DOING THAT. IF YOU HAD A CANNABIS ASSOCIATION AND YOU HAD A PROBLEM OF THAT MAGNITUDE WITH BLACK MARKET MARIJUANA YOU WOULD HAVE A PROBLEM IF YOU WERE RUNNING A CHAIN OF PHARMACIES AND YOU HAD A PROBLEM WITH FENNEL WALKING OUT THE BACK DOOR YOU WOULD HAVE A PROBLEM IF YOU WERE. THE BAR ASSOCIATION YOU'RE REGULATING LAW FIRMS. AND A HUGE PERCENTAGE YOUR LAW FIRMS WERE STEALING THEIR CLIENTS TRUST MONEY YOU WOULD HAVE A PROBLEM. SO I HOPE WE'VE CONVEYED TO ACCURATELY AND- FORCEFULLY THAT IT IS BROKE ANY DEFECTS. SO MY SPECIFIC QUESTION AND I'D APPRECIATE A SPECIFIC ANSWER FROM PREFERABLY THE CEO. WHAT MECHANISMS DOES YOUR ORGANIZATION HAVE IN PLACE RIGHT NOW TODAY. TO IDENTIFY MASSAGE FACILITIES THAT MAY BE PARTICIPATING IN HUMAN TRAFFICKING ONE TWO TO REPORT THAT TO LAW ENFORCEMENT PARTNERS SO INVESTIGATIONS CAN BE CONDUCTED AND THREE TO REDRESS IF IT IF IT DOES TURN OUT THAT IN FACT HUMAN TRAFFICKING IS OCCURRING AND ONE OF THE FACILITIES THAT'S PART OF YOUR ORGANIZATION. I APPRECIATE VERY SPECIFIC AND DETAILED ANSWERS TO THOSE QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- SO FIRST ARM AGAIN THE CALIFORNIA MASSAGE THERAPY COUNCIL DOES NOT TO REGULATE MASSAGE ESTABLISHMENTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ONLY LOCAL GOVERNMENTHAS AUTHORITY TO REGULATE ESTABLISHMENTS IN DANGER IT'S JURISDICTION- WE DO WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH FIVE HUNDRED POLICE DEPARTMENTS AND SHERIFF'S- BUT SEEM TO SEIZE. OUR MANDATE IS TO VET AND CERTIFIED THE INDIVIDUAL THERAPIST. IN TWO- APPROVED SPECIFIC MASSAGE PROGRAM. THAT WAY WE CAN HELP LOCAL GOVERNMENT FIGHT HUMAN TRAFFICKING IN GEORGIA RESTRICTION. THE MAIN ONE OF THE MAIN TOOL HAS TO DO IS TRAINING THEM. ON THE ISSUE. WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH ANTI HUMAN TRAFFICKING ORGANIZATION. BUT PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAYS WE'VE DONE TO ASSIST IS TO DEAL WITH DIPLOMA MALES WHICH YOU MEANT TRAFFICKERS USE IN ORDER TO OBTAIN CERTIFICATIONS FROM SCHOOLS THAT ACTIVELY SELL DIPLOMA. SO AGAIN. YOUR MIND EVERYBODY SEEM TO SEE IT DOES NOT HAVE ANY JURISDICTION OVER MASSAGE ESTABLISHMENTS IN THE STATE HE SAYS SPECIFICALLY UNDER JURISDICTIONS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT ONLY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH A SEMINAR CUNNINGHAM SENATOR ROB. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- AS YOU CAN TELL THAT WE'VE GOT SOME CONCERNS HERE THESE ARE SOME VERY SERIOUS ISSUES I WANT TO START BY SAYING FROM FROM MY PERSPECTIVE WITH THE RECENT EXCEPTIONS AND SOME OF THEM SIGNIFICANT- I THINK THE COUNCIL IS A- IS AN EXAMPLE OF A FISSION SEE AN EFFECTIVENESS- IN THE ADMINISTRATION AND REGULATION SO TO SPEAK OF AN OCCUPATION IN THE STATE. AND I'M TALKING ABOUT LICENSING AND ENFORCEMENT AND MANY OF THE VARIOUS ISSUES- COST AND BUDGET FISCAL THERE WE TALK ABOUT WHEN WE DO THE SUNSET REVIEWS WITH BOARDS- IN THE STATE OF IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- WHILE THERE ARE SOME DIFFERENCES IN THE WAY GOVERNMENT OVERSIGHT OF KERR'S. BETWEEN YOUR NONPROFIT FORM OF. OF ORGANIZATION IN THE TYPICAL TRADITIONAL- STATE BOARDS THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO DO THE OVERSIGHT AND OTHER WAYS TO ENSURE. THE PROTECTION OF CONSUMERS AND- PROTECTION OF THOSE WHO ARE SEEKING- ASSERTIVE CERTIFICATES IN YOUR CASE LICENSES THAN OTHERS- AND THE COUNCIL SEEMS TO WORK WHEN IT COMES TO THAT BUT- THERE ARE A COUPLE AREAS ACTUALLY SOME SIGNIFICANT AREAS WHERE I THINK AND I JOIN MY COLLEAGUES. SOME FURTHER ATTENTION NEEDS TO BE DIRECTED IN THE FIRST. IS THE ISSUE OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING- I WILL SAY HAVING LISTENED TO THE CONVERSATION BOTH MY COLLEAGUE IN THE SENATE IN MY COLLEAGUES HERE IN THE ASSEMBLY. IS THAT- THE COUNCIL HAS DONE A LESS THAN SATISFACTORY JOB IN EITHER EXPLAINING ITS INTERFACE WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. OR IN CONDUCTING INTERFACE WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT I UNDERSTAND THAT YOUR JOB IS TO PROVIDE VOLUNTARY CERTIFICATION OF THOSE MASSAGE THERAPIST TO CHOOSE TO AVAIL THEMSELVES OF IT- BUT THERE'S A LARGER ISSUE HERE AND I DON'T THINK YOU CAN SIMPLY SAY WE JUST SORT OF FIVE A SIDE. THERAPISTS AND NOT DEAL WITH THE ISSUE OF WHAT GOES ON IN THE FACILITIES THAT YOU DO NOT CERTIFY BUT WHERE YOU'RE CERTIFIED MASSAGE THERAPIST WORK. AND SO I WOULD HOPE THAT THE NEXT TIME WE HAVE THIS CONVERSATION. THERE IS A MORE DETAILED EXPLANATION AND SPECIFIC EXPLANATION OF HOW THE COUNCIL IS WORKING WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. WITH DISTRICT ATTORNEYS AND FRANKLY WITH THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL ALL OF WHOM HAVE A MUCH GREATER ROLE. IN SOME RESPECTS THEN THE COUNCIL DOES IN PUTTING A STOP TO HUMAN TRAFFICKING BUT YOU CANNOT SAY ALL WE DO IS CERTIFIED MASSAGE THERAPISTS AND LEAVE IT AT THAT AND THE EXPLANATION THAT WAS PROVIDED TO SOME VERY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS. ASKING A VARIETY WAYS WAS PRETTY GENERAL AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED AND I WANT MORE DETAIL AND I SUSPECT MY COLLEAGUES TO OR- THERE MAY BE A CHANGE IN THE WAY WE DEAL WITH MASSAGE THERAPIST AS AN OCCUPATION IN THE STATE. NOW WHAT MY COLLEAGUES MAY OR MAY NOT REALIZE IS. IF WE CREATE A LICENSING SITUATION THAT'S NOT GOING TO END HUMAN TRAFFICKING. IT STILL REQUIRES ACTIVITY BY THE LICENSING AGENCY BY THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S BY THE COUNTY SURE SENT BY THE LOCAL POLICE CHIEFS TO PUT A STOP TO IT BUT I'D I'D EXPECT MORE EXPLANATION AND I CERTAINLY EXPECT THAT THE NEXT TIME WE DEAL WITH THIS. OTHER SECOND ISSUE THAT I THINK YOU NEED TO GIVE SOME THOUGHT TO IS INCREASED PARTICIPATION BY A MASSAGE PROFESSIONALS AND BY DISINTERESTED MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. ON YOUR BOARD I THINK TO HAVE ADDITIONAL AND ALSO TO PROVIDE FOR SPECIFIC TERMS AND FOR A MORE DEFINITE APPOINTMENT PROCESS FOR YOUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS BECAUSE I THINK THAT MAY ADDRESS SOME OF THE- THE COMPENSATION CONCERNS RAISED BY MY COLLEAGUES. NOW THE FIGURE A HUNDRED AND OF US AT A HUNDRED AND SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS WAS CITED FOR A GOVERNMENT STATE EMPLOYER RUNNING ONE OF THESE BOARDS THAT IS REGULATED BY THE DCA AND OF COURSE. AS YOUR COMPENSATION. POINTED OUT THAT DOES NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT A VERY VERY GENEROUS PARTICIPATION. IN OUR OUR CALPERS SYSTEM THAT PROBABLY NEEDS TO BE. VALUED ADDED TO THAT- BASED COMPENSATION AND IT ALSO ILLUSTRATES PERHAPS HOW WOEFULLY UNDERPAID SOME OF OUR STATE EMPLOYEES. THE GOOD ONES WERE WORKING VERY VERY HARD AT THESE BOARDS- EARN. THESE THE OTHER POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS I BELIEVE HAVING REVIEWED THE BACKGROUND MATERIAL. THAT YOU NEED TO A MUCH MORE ROBUST APPROVAL PROCESS- AND A MUCH MORE ROBUST. SYSTEM WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH- WITH APPROVALS AND DISCIPLINE. HAVING TO DO WITH SCHOOLS FRANKLY HAVING HEARING OFFICERS EMPLOYED BY THE COUNCIL MAKING FINAL DECISIONS WITHOUT. ANY APPEAL% IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY- DOESN'T WORK FOR ME SO THIS IS MY CAR THIS IS MY QUESTION AND YOU'LL HAVE A CHANCE TO RESPOND TO IT HOW CAN WE IMPROVE THIS PROCESS TO ADD A BIT MORE DUE PROCESS TO THE PROPER. RESPOND YES SIR. WELL FIRST OF ALL THERE IS AN APPEAL PROCESS SO- THE BEFORE SCHOOL GET EITHER DENIED OR AREN'T APPROVED THEY RECEIVE IT WHAT IT'S CALLED THE PROPOSED DENIAL- DOCUMENT THEY GET TO REVIEW IT THEY CAN REQUEST A HEARING THEY HAVE A HEARING IN FRONT OF HEARING OFFICERS AND IF THEY ARE DO NOT AGREE WITH THAT- DECISION OF THE HEARING OFFICER'S THEY DO HAVE THE ABILITY TO REQUEST AN APPEAL. IN FRONT OF THE ENTIRE BOARD. A SO WE DO HAVE ALL THESE PROCESSES IN PLACE I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A COMMENT IN REGARD TO HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND LAW ENFORCEMENT. I LOVE TO SHARE WITH YOU WOULD THAT SEEM TO SEE AS A STRATEGIC PARTNER OF THE CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION. WE WORK VERY VERY CLOSELY WITH ALL THE POLICE CHIEFS OF ALL THE POLICE DEPARTMENTS LITERALLY ON A DAILY BASIS I WE'VE ENTIRE STAFF FOR. MANY OF THEM A PAST LAW ENFORCEMENT- OFFICIALS THEMSELVES WE DROP WAS LAW ENFORCEMENT ON THE DAILY BASIS SO WE HAVE A VERY ROBUST COMMUNICATION PROCESS BETWEEN- SHERIFF'S- AND LAW ENFORCEMENT GENERAL'S WORK FOR CLOSELY WITH THE ACE. SO DR- SYSTEM IS ALREADY IN PLACE IN. ADDITION TO THAT WE PROVIDED TRAINING. COOL MORE THAN THREE TO. UP OFFICE AND- DA'S- SHERIFF DEPUTIES ON THE ISSUE OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND OTHER ILLICIT ACTIVITY SO EVEN THOUGH WE DO NOT REGULATED ESTABLISHMENTS. WE ARE THERE TO SUPPORT THEM WITH OUR EXPERTISE AND- AND- ON A DAILY BASIS WELL THE NEXT TIME WE GATHERED TOGETHER AT THE RIVER I'D LIKE FOR YOU TO SOMEBODY TO PROVIDE SOME MORE SPECIFICS AS TO WHAT YOUR ACCOMPLISHMENTS ARE. WITH RESPECT TO THE ELIMINATION OF- OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING I'M SURE YOU HAVE THEM SOMEWHERE IN THE SYSTEM AND I'D LIKE TO HEAR ABOUT THEM BUT LET ME GO BACK TO THIS HEARING OFFICER BUSINESS IF IT DOESN'T WORK FOR ME TO HAVE. HEARING OFFICERS EMPLOYED BY THE COUNCIL. MAKING DETERMINATIONS THAT'S NOT DUE PROCESS. THIS IS ALLISON SIEGEL- I SPECIAL COUNSEL TO OVERSEE THE ENTIRE PROCESS TO ADDRESS THAT. YES GOOD MORNING SHARING COMMITTEE MEMBERS- SO FIRST OF ALL HEARING OFFICERS RECEIVED YOU SEE ARE EMPLOYED BY CTC BUT THAT'S REALLY NO DIFFERENT THAN ALE JAY'S LETTER IMPLIED BY THE STATE THAT ARE MAKING DECISIONS ON MATTERS WHERE PEOPLE ARE CHALLENGING STATE ACTION WOMAN. LET ME YOU THAT'S NOT TOTALLY TRUE. THE ALJS GENERALLY WORK FOR AN OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE LIFE BELIEVE IN THE STATE. THEY'RE NOT WORKING FOR THE SPECIFIC AGENCY THAT IS DEALING WITH THE- DECISION MAKING PROCESS AND REPORTING PRESUMABLY TO THE AGENCY SECRETARY OR DEPARTMENT HEAD SO I BELIEVE IF I UNDERSTAND HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS IN CALIFORNIA. IT IS SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT THAN THE SYSTEM THAT IS DESCRIBED IN OUR BACKGROUND PAPER AND THAT YOU OPERATE UNDER AS A COUNSELOR MY NOT CORRECT. WELL YOU'RE CORRECT IN THAT REGARD BUT LET ME SAY THAT FIRST OF ALL HEARING OFFICERS ARE NOT- LIKE THEY DON'T REPORT THIS TO THE CBO OVERSEAS THE ENTIRE. UP PROGRAM THEY REPORT TO THE STAFF ATTORNEYS AND THEY DEAL THE STAFF ATTORNEYS ON A DAILY BASIS. THE HEARING OFFICER'S ARE ONLY USED ON AN AS NEEDED BASIS WHAT THAT MEANS IS HEARINGS ARE HELD ON THURSDAYS. AND THE ONLY WORK A FEW HOURS A WEEK IF THEY'RE WORKING THAT WEEK THEY DO NOT ALL WORK EVERY ALL HAVE OTHER POSITIONS AND JOBS BECAUSE THIS IS A VERY LIMITED POSITION. AND THE ONLY THING THAT THEY DO IS THEY'RE DEDICATED AS HEARING OFFICERS THEY ARE NOT INVOLVED IN ANY OTHER PART OF THE PROCESS. SO WHAT IS THE RECOURSE IF THE HEARING OFFICER ISSUES A DECISION AND THE BOARD. THE ENTITY TAKES THE APPEAL TO THE BOARD AND THE BOARD RENDERS A DECISION THAT'S DEEMED UNSATISFACTORY IS AT THE END OF THE PROCESS. SO AGAIN HEARING OFFICERS IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SCHOOLS THAT'S DIFFERENT THAN INDIVIDUALS SCHOOL FOR SCHOOL SECURITY OFFICERS HERE THAT MATTER. IF THE INDIVIDUAL DOES NOT LIKE THE DECISION FROM THE HEARING OFFICER'S THEY CAN GOING TO KILL TO THE BOARD THEY'RE ALLOWED TO MAKE A PRESENTATION TO THE BOARD. THE BOARD CAN EITHER UPHOLD THE DECISION OR SEND IT BACK- IF THEY UPHOLD THE DECISION THEN THE SCHOOLS CAN GO AHEAD AND APPEAL TO SUPERIOR COURT THEY BRING A PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE WITH SUPERIOR COURT CHALLENGING THE ACTION OF SEEING TO SEE. BUT IS WHAT'S THE STANDARD ON HERE ELEMENT IF YOU WANT BILLION THIS. WHAT'S THE STANDARD ON. ON ON REVIEW OF REVIEW AT THE WRIT OF MANDATE STAGES THAT SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE WHICH MEANS IF THE IF YOU KNOW. IF THE BOARD HAS ANY EVIDENCE ON WHICH REASONABLE EVIDENCE ON WHICH TO BASE THE DECISION. THE DECISION STANDS OR IS IT A GOOD NOVEL REVIEW. I THINK IT IS IT IS BASED ON SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE WHICH IS NOT MUCH OF AN APPEAL AT ALL I DON'T WANT TO BELABOR THIS BECAUSE- THE CHAIR HAS OTHER BUSINESS TO. MOVE THROUGH AND WE HAVE PUBLIC COMMENT BUT I WOULD LIKE YOU TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THAT'S A LOT OF DUE PROCESS. AND I AND I'M NOT I'M IN FAVOR OF THE NONPROFIT METHOD OF REGULATING. THIS PARTICULAR OCCUPATION IF WE CAN MAKE IT WORK BUT I DO THINK THIS PARTICULAR ASPECT OF THE NEEDS OF TIME AND ATTENTION. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR EXPLANATION I LOOK FORWARD HAVING FURTHER CONVERSATION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SENATE ROTH. A QUESTION BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER IRWIN. YES THANK YOU AND MOST OF MY QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN ASKED BUT I- I DID HAVE A QUESTION OF I WAS ON THE- CITY COUNCIL IN THOUSAND OAKS AND THERE WAS A HUGE CONCERN WITH THE PROLIFERATION OF. I GUESS I'M NOT SURE THE MASSAGE INSTITUTIONS I GUESS- MAYBE THAT IS THE- APPROPRIATE WORD. BUT THEY DON'T THINK THAT THEY CAN LIMIT THE NUMBER OF- MASSAGE PARLORS IN THE IN THE- CITY. IS THAT IS THERE ANYTHING THAT CAN BE DONE ABOUT THAT AT THE STATE LEVEL. I WILL ADDRESS THAT- THE HAVE COMPLETE CONTROL. OVER ANY LAND USE ISSUES AND THE NUMBER OFF AT ANY ESTABLISHMENT DATE THEY CAN HAVE IN THE JURISDICTION- DODD WAS A- IT WAS NOT CLEAR- INDONESIA LAW THE GOVERNING LAW FOR C. M. D. C. AND AFTER THE FIRST SUNSET REVIEW CMT C. SUPPORTED CHANGES IN THE LANGUAGE TO MAKE IT VERY CLEAR THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. CAN COMPLETELY CONTROL THAT ASPECT SO THERE THEY ARE FREE TO APPLY ANY KIND OF LIMITS. I'D I'D I'D I DON'T THINK THAT'S THEIR UNDERSTANDING BUT I WILL CERTAINLY- REPORT THAT BACK THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AT CENTER JULY THANK YOU MR- THE SENATOR ROTH COACH ERIC MENTIONED ABOUT- WORKING WITH POLICE DEPARTMENT YOU SAID YOU HAD MENTIONED THAT YOU WERE CANDID HAVE POLICE CHIEFS AND SHERIFFS DEPARTMENT SHOW ON AND YOU ENHANCE THEIR INVESTIGATION SOMEWHERE THAT'S IMPRESSION I'VE GOTTEN WITH ADVICE AND COUNSEL WHAT ADVICE AND COUNSEL DO YOU GIVE TH POLICE DEPARTMENTS AND SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENTS. TO I GUESS ENHANCE THE SAFETY AND PROTOCOL THE LAW WHICH IS- PREVENTING ANY ILLICIT ACTIVITY IN THESE- MASSAGE PARLORS THAT TAKE PLACE AND IN THE COURSE- WE'RE ALL CONCERNED THAT THE THERAPIST WHO TRULY TRULY WORKS WITH AN INDIVIDUAL WE'VE BEEN IN AN ACCIDENT AND SO ON- THAT THAT IS VITAL THAT PHYSICAL THERAPIST BUT THE OTHERS WERE CONCERNED ABOUT BUT WHAT WHAT GIVE THE DEPARTMENTS. THAT WILL PREVENT THE OTHER PART OF THIS WHOLE ISSUE. SO FIRST OF ALL- PREVENTING IT COMPLETELY- I DON'T KNOW TO SOMETHING LIKE THAT CAN BE ACHIEVED ANYTIME SOON UNFORTUNATELY. IT'S A REALITY THAT WE ARE FACING ALL OVER THE COUNTRY IN OTHER STATES FORTY THREE OTHER STATES THAT HAVE LICENSING LAWS AND GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS AND SONG- ARE A DIRECTOR ALL FELL LAW ENFORCEMENT- RELATIONS. IS THIRTY YEARS FORTY YEARS EXPERIENCE IN- VICE AND MASSAGE AT THE SHOES WITH LAPD. AND HE'S THE ONE IN CHARGE CORD PROVIDING THESE VERY RIGOROUS TRAINING THAT WE PROVIDE LAW ENFORCEMENT THROUGHOUT THE STATES ARE PROBABLY DISCUSS THE TRAINING THAT WOULD PROVIDE IT WOULD PROVIDE FREE OF CHARGE- TOOL- LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT'S THAT PROBABLY THE CORNERSTONE OF WHAT WE DO. IN ADDITION TO THAT THERE IS AN ONGOING VERY ROBUST COMMUNICATION SHARING BETWEEN SEEING P. C. AND LAW ENFORCEMENT. SO I'M JUST THINKING ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR CASE- THAT- I REMEMBER FROM LAST YEAR IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY WHERE- SAN JOSE POLICE DEPARTMENT ARRESTED A AN INDIVIDUAL THAT ENGAGE IN- CHILD **** A AND- WE WORKED VERY CLOSELY WITH THE DA- THE MOMENT THE PA FILE CHARGES FORTY FIVE MINUTES AFTER THE CHARGES WERE FILED THIS INDIVIDUAL WAS SUSPENDED- SO THIS IS THE KIND OF SWIFT ACTION WE HAVE WELL WE ARE WORKING IN COORDINATION OF COOPERATION WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ON A DAILY BASIS. HE'S JUST IN ONE EXAMPLE. VERY GOOD THANK YOU MISTER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ACTUALLY.

LEGAL RECOGNITION OF THE PRACTICE OF MASSAGE THERAPY AND CLEARLY FAIR LICENSING REQUIREMENTS TO PRACTICE ARE CENTRAL TO THE PROTECT THE HEALTH SAFETY AND WELFARE OF THE PUBLIC AND EVERY CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY.
