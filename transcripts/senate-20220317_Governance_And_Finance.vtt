00:16:54.012 --> 00:16:55.781
LOT OF FLEXIBLE MAINTENANCE

00:16:55.848 --> 00:16:58.016
FUNDING INTO PROJECTS THAT NOT

00:16:58.083 --> 00:17:00.552
ONLY FIX OUR STREETS BUT I BIKE

00:17:00.619 --> 00:17:03.389

OUR OPPOSITION LETTER TODAY. THE

00:17:10.562 --> 00:17:12.331
THOUSANDS OF PROJECTS THAT HAVE

00:17:12.398 --> 00:17:13.565
BEEN COMPLETED WITH FLEXIBLE SB

00:17:13.632 --> 00:17:15.167
ONE FUNDING SO WE DON'T HAVE A

00:17:15.234 --> 00:17:16.435
PRINCE THE PROBLEM WITH THIS

00:17:16.502 --> 00:17:19.204
BILL WE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE

00:17:19.271 --> 00:17:20.439
SPECIFICS AND THE IMPLEMENTATION

00:17:20.506 --> 00:17:22.508
AND HOW IT'S DONE FIRST OFF

00:17:22.574 --> 00:17:24.076
WHILE WE APPRECIATE THE IDEA OF

00:17:24.143 --> 00:17:25.778
CREATING A NEW GRANT PROGRAM

00:17:25.844 --> 00:17:27.513
THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT UNMET

00:17:27.579 --> 00:17:29.148
FUNDING NEEDS THAT ALREADY EXIST

00:17:29.214 --> 00:17:31.083
ON THE SYSTEM SO WE'VE OUTLINED

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:33.152
ABOUT TWENTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS

00:17:33.218 --> 00:17:35.454
OVER THE NEXT DECADE UNMET NEEDS

00:17:35.521 --> 00:17:36.822
FOR OUR EXISTING COMPLETE

00:17:36.889 --> 00:17:38.624
STREETS FEATURES SIDEWALKS

00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:40.459
PEDESTRIAN SIGNALS BIKE LANES

00:17:40.526 --> 00:17:42.094
THINGS OF THAT NATURE. WE USED

00:17:42.161 --> 00:17:43.662
THE EXAMPLE FROM THE STANISLAUS

00:17:43.729 --> 00:17:45.097
COUNTY COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS

00:17:45.164 --> 00:17:46.265
NON MOTORIZED TRANSPORTATION

00:17:46.331 --> 00:17:48.434
PLAN THAT IDENTIFIES TWO HUNDRED

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:49.968
AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS WORTH

00:17:50.035 --> 00:17:52.237
OF IMPROVEMENTS TO DO THESE TYPE

00:17:52.304 --> 00:17:53.705
OF PROJECTS IN THEIR

00:17:53.772 --> 00:17:55.274
JURISDICTION I DON'T THINK THAT

00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:56.542
PLAN ACTUALLY WOULD MEET THE

00:17:56.608 --> 00:17:59.478
VERY SPECIFIC CRITERIA IN SB

00:17:59.545 --> 00:18:00.512
NINE THREE TWO BUT ASSUMING THAT

00:18:00.579 --> 00:18:02.481
IT DID AND WE MULTIPLY THAT AND

00:18:02.548 --> 00:18:04.149
SO TRIED TO GET A STATE WIDE

00:18:04.216 --> 00:18:05.384
ESTIMATE OF WHAT THAT WOULD MEAN

00:18:05.451 --> 00:18:07.019
THAT'S OVER SEVENTEEN BILLION

00:18:07.085 --> 00:18:07.653
DOLLARS WORTH OF PROJECTS THAT

00:18:07.719 --> 00:18:09.621
ARE NEEDED RIGHT THERE. AND SO

00:18:09.688 --> 00:18:10.589
WE WERE LOOKING AT THIS BILL

00:18:10.656 --> 00:18:12.391

CIRCULATION ELEMENT THAT REALLY

00:18:17.262 --> 00:18:20.599
EMBRACE SAFETY AND MULTI MELISSA

00:18:20.666 --> 00:18:22.201
BUT THE TIME LINES IN THE BILL

00:18:22.267 --> 00:18:24.203
AND THE SPECIFIC- IMPROVEMENTS

00:18:24.269 --> 00:18:25.971
THAT ARE REQUIRED NEED TO BE

00:18:26.038 --> 00:18:28.540
BASED ON A REASONABLY AVAILABLE

00:18:28.607 --> 00:18:30.309

ABSOLUTELY AND I APPRECIATE THE

00:23:25.337 --> 00:23:27.105
SPIRIT OF THE OPPOSITION YOU

00:23:27.172 --> 00:23:28.440
KNOW WE ALL WANT SAFE STREETS WE

00:23:28.507 --> 00:23:31.143
ALL WANT- FOLKS TO BE ABLE TO

00:23:31.209 --> 00:23:34.846
COMMUTE TO WORK. WALK TO WORK

00:23:34.913 --> 00:23:35.847
FUNCTION IN OUR YOU KNOW.

00:23:35.914 --> 00:23:39.684
INTENSIFIED AND MANY CITIES HAVE

00:23:39.751 --> 00:23:41.153
HAD GOOD INTENTIONS IN THE PAST

00:23:41.219 --> 00:23:43.789
AND HAVE ADOPTED PLANTS- BUT FOR

00:23:43.855 --> 00:23:44.689
ONE REASON OR ANOTHER HAVE BEEN

00:23:44.756 --> 00:23:47.292
IMPLEMENTED. AND SO WHAT THIS

00:23:47.359 --> 00:23:49.995
BILL IS SEEKING TO DO. IS TO ADD

00:23:50.061 --> 00:23:52.097
CITIES UPDATED GENERAL PLAN

00:23:52.164 --> 00:23:54.332
WHICH THEY HAVE TO DO- UNLESS

00:23:54.399 --> 00:23:57.702
TWENTY YEAR CYCLE- TO MAKE SURE

00:23:57.769 --> 00:24:00.405
THAT THEY- CREATE. LIKE PLANS

00:24:00.472 --> 00:24:02.741
DIFFERENT PLANTS AS PART OF THAT

00:24:02.808 --> 00:24:04.943
PROCESS. AS YOU KNOW I MADE THE

00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:07.245
FUNDING ELEMENT OF THIS ONE OF

00:24:07.312 --> 00:24:10.115
MY TOP. BUDGET PRIORITIES- FOR

00:24:10.182 --> 00:24:12.684
OUR SENATE CAUCUS BECAUSE I DO

00:24:12.751 --> 00:24:15.187
BELIEVE- WE SHOULD PUT OUR MONEY

00:24:15.253 --> 00:24:16.421
WHERE OUR GOOD INTENTIONS AREN'T

00:24:16.488 --> 00:24:17.889
SO. THERE IS A CORRESPONDING

00:24:17.956 --> 00:24:21.126
BUDGET ASK TO HELP CITIES OFFSET

00:24:21.193 --> 00:24:23.161
THE COST OF THIS. THE OTHER

00:24:23.228 --> 00:24:25.864
PIECE OF IT AS THE FOLKS ON THE

00:24:25.931 --> 00:24:27.299
LINE OF TALK ABOUT WE HAVE

00:24:27.365 --> 00:24:29.367
TECHNOLOGY WE KNOW WHAT WORKS WE

00:24:29.434 --> 00:24:31.002
KNOW IT DOESN'T WORK WE ALSO

00:24:31.069 --> 00:24:32.237
HAVE DATA TO SHOW WHERE IT'S

00:24:32.304 --> 00:24:33.738
NEEDED AND SO WITH THIS BILL

00:24:33.805 --> 00:24:35.507
SEEKS TO DO IS TO USE ALL OF

00:24:35.574 --> 00:24:37.409
THAT DATA AND ALL OF OUR

00:24:37.475 --> 00:24:38.910
KNOWLEDGE BOTH FROM THE

00:24:38.977 --> 00:24:40.445
COLLECTION SIDE AND THE

00:24:40.512 --> 00:24:42.747
ENGINEERING SIDE TO SAY LET'S IN

00:24:42.814 --> 00:24:44.115
MAKING IMPROVEMENTS WHERE

00:24:44.182 --> 00:24:45.917
THEY'RETHE MOST NEEDED BECAUSE

00:24:45.984 --> 00:24:48.119
AFTER WE HAVE THE MOST FRANKLY

00:24:48.186 --> 00:24:51.089
FATALITIES. AND SO IF YOU HAVE

00:24:51.156 --> 00:24:52.457
THE RESOURCES IF YOU HAVE THE

00:24:52.524 --> 00:24:56.027
PLAN IF YOU HAVE THE ENGINEERING

00:24:56.094 --> 00:24:57.963
AND IF YOU HAVE THE TIME. AND

00:24:58.029 --> 00:24:59.965
STILL ABOUT SOLVE THE PROBLEM.

00:25:00.031 --> 00:25:01.533
THEN YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE SO THEY

00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:04.069
SAID AGAIN. IF YOU HAVE THE

00:25:04.135 --> 00:25:06.972
PLAN. THE ENGINEERING. THE DATA

00:25:07.038 --> 00:25:09.307
AND THE TIME AND WE STILL DON'T

00:25:09.374 --> 00:25:12.477
USE ALL OF THOSE MECHANISMS. TO

00:25:12.544 --> 00:25:14.846
SOLVE THE PROBLEM. THEN THIS

00:25:14.913 --> 00:25:16.648
BILL IS GOING TO CREATE A

00:25:16.715 --> 00:25:19.451
RESPONSIBILITY. I THINK WE THINK

00:25:19.517 --> 00:25:21.987
THAT THAT WILL FRANKLY HELP.

00:25:22.053 --> 00:25:25.090
INSPIRED LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO

00:25:25.156 --> 00:25:28.560
USE THE TIME THE MONEY THE DATA

00:25:28.627 --> 00:25:30.061
AND THE ENGINEERING TO SOLVE THE

00:25:30.128 --> 00:25:32.898
PROBLEM IT'S- NUMBER AT THE END

00:25:32.964 --> 00:25:35.533
OF THE TRAIL- AGAIN. I COME FROM

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:37.602
LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND YOU KNOW

00:25:37.669 --> 00:25:39.404
WHAT I SAID LOCAL GOVERNMENT I

00:25:39.471 --> 00:25:41.006
WOULD QUESTION SOMETIMES WHEN

00:25:41.072 --> 00:25:41.940
SACRAMENTO WOULD REQUIRE US TO

00:25:42.007 --> 00:25:43.942
DO THINGS UNFUNDED AGAIN THERE'S

00:25:44.009 --> 00:25:45.677
A CORRESPONDING BUDGET REQUEST.

00:25:45.744 --> 00:25:47.245
I WOULD SOMETIMES QUESTION

00:25:47.312 --> 00:25:49.214
SACRAMENTO WHEN THEY WOULD PASS

00:25:49.281 --> 00:25:51.082
THE PROBLEM ON TO US THAT THIS

00:25:51.149 --> 00:25:52.918
IS A LOCAL PROBLEM THIS ISN'T

00:25:52.984 --> 00:25:54.586
SACRAMENTO PASSING A PROBLEM

00:25:54.653 --> 00:25:56.321
ONTO A LOCAL GOVERNMENT THIS IS

00:25:56.388 --> 00:25:58.056
SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS ON THE

00:25:58.123 --> 00:25:58.523
LOCAL LEVEL. IN THOSE

00:25:58.590 --> 00:26:00.125
COMMUNITIES THEREFORE THOSE

00:26:00.191 --> 00:26:01.359
LOCAL COMMUNITIES HAVE A

00:26:01.426 --> 00:26:05.196
RESPONSIBILITY TO SOLVE IT AND

00:26:05.263 --> 00:26:07.799
SO I THINK THIS IS A STRONG BILL

00:26:07.866 --> 00:26:09.167
. BECAUSE IT REQUIRES. A LOT OF

00:26:09.234 --> 00:26:11.736
TIME REQUIRES FUNDING USES

00:26:11.803 --> 00:26:12.871
ENGINEERING AND THEN MORE

00:26:12.938 --> 00:26:14.539
IMPORTANTLY THE DATA TO

00:26:14.606 --> 00:26:17.575
UNDERSCORE SELF YES IT'S A TOUGH

00:26:17.642 --> 00:26:21.046
BILL BUT- AS I SAID IN AS THE

00:26:21.112 --> 00:26:23.281
FOLKS THAT TESTIFIED. IT'S TOUGH

00:26:23.348 --> 00:26:25.250
FOR FAMILY WHEN A LOVED ONE IS

00:26:25.317 --> 00:26:27.152
HIT BY A CAR RUSHING TO THE BUS

00:26:27.218 --> 00:26:28.920
IT'S TOUGH FOR FAMILY WHEN THE

00:26:28.987 --> 00:26:31.222
BREADWINNER IS. RIDING THE BIKE

00:26:31.289 --> 00:26:34.225
TO WORK IN. IT TOOK BY CAR- AND

00:26:34.292 --> 00:26:35.860
SO THAT'S WHY I THINK IT'S

00:26:35.927 --> 00:26:37.395
NECESSARY SO I THINK I TOUCHED

00:26:37.462 --> 00:26:39.164
UPON ALL THE FILMS. AND I LOOK

00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:40.632
FORWARD TO WORKING WITH MY

00:26:40.699 --> 00:26:41.299
FRIENDS IN THE COUNTIES AND THE

00:26:41.366 --> 00:26:42.367
CITIES AS THIS BILL MOVES

00:26:42.434 --> 00:26:44.135
FORWARD AND I REALLY DO

00:26:44.202 --> 00:26:45.370
APPRECIATE. THE INPUT FROM THE

00:26:45.437 --> 00:26:46.438
CHAIR AND THE AMENDMENTS WE'VE

00:26:46.504 --> 00:26:48.206
WE'VE TAKEN- BASED ON THE CHAIRS

00:26:48.273 --> 00:26:49.374
AND PLAY AGAIN ANOTHER CHAMPION

00:26:49.441 --> 00:26:50.508
A LOCAL GOVERNMENT. BECAUSE

00:26:50.575 --> 00:26:52.310
WE'VE IMPROVE THIS BILL BUT KEPT

00:26:52.377 --> 00:26:54.312
ITS FRANKLY TOUGH FRAMEWORK IN

00:26:54.379 --> 00:26:58.049
PLACE BECAUSE THIS IS A AN ISSUE

00:26:58.116 --> 00:27:00.919
THAT NEEDS. SOME TOUGH LOVE.

00:27:00.986 --> 00:27:01.686
YOUR BROWSER DOES THAT ANSWER

00:27:01.753 --> 00:27:05.256

REACHING A BALANCE THAT DEALS

00:49:37.641 --> 00:49:38.642
WITH THE IMPORTANT

00:49:38.709 --> 00:49:40.410
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO SPEAK.

I- WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR

00:49:55.158 --> 00:49:56.760
BRINGING THIS BILL THIS IS NOT

00:49:56.827 --> 00:49:59.529
AN EASY ISSUE- BUT IT'S

00:49:59.596 --> 00:50:01.965
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT I BELIEVE

00:50:02.032 --> 00:50:03.600
IN THIS COMMITTEE- THE CHAIR AND

00:50:03.667 --> 00:50:08.372
ARE ARE THE TWO MEMBERS WHOSERVE THE LOCAL. ELECTED OFFICE-

00:50:08.438 --> 00:50:10.640
BEFORE COMING HERE. AND ALONG

00:50:10.707 --> 00:50:12.476
WITH THE AUTHOR AND OF YOU KNOW

00:50:12.542 --> 00:50:16.279
IT'S A DIFFERENT- SITUATION- AND

00:50:16.346 --> 00:50:18.215
IN MANY WAYS IT'S GREAT YOU ARE.

00:50:18.281 --> 00:50:19.750
RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF YOUR

00:50:19.816 --> 00:50:22.252
COMMUNITY AND IT'S VERY ON THE

00:50:22.319 --> 00:50:24.388
GROUND AND- THAT'S INCREDIBLY

00:50:24.454 --> 00:50:26.890
ENERGIZING AND POWERFUL- BUT IT

00:50:26.957 --> 00:50:30.394
CAN BE EXTREMELY. INTENSE AND I

00:50:30.460 --> 00:50:32.529
THINK LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS.

00:50:32.596 --> 00:50:36.166
HAVE ALWAYS BEEN. VERY EXPOSED-

00:50:36.233 --> 00:50:38.635
IN IN WAYS THAT ARE GOOD BUT

00:50:38.702 --> 00:50:40.437
ALSO IN WAYS THAT ARE THE TIMES

00:50:40.504 --> 00:50:43.273
UNSAFE- AND THE HOST GOT MORE

00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:45.242
INTENSE OVER TIME. WHEN I WAS ON

00:50:45.308 --> 00:50:47.244
THE SAN FRANCISCO BOARD OF

00:50:47.310 --> 00:50:47.744
SUPERVISORS I REMEMBER

00:50:47.811 --> 00:50:49.413
PARTICULAR TIME WHEN WE WERE

00:50:49.479 --> 00:50:51.548
HAVING A VERY VERY INTENSE VOTE

00:50:51.615 --> 00:50:53.183
ABOUT WHETHER TO REMOVE A

00:50:53.250 --> 00:50:55.819
PARTICULAR- ELECTED OFFICIAL

00:50:55.886 --> 00:50:59.322
FROM OFFICE. FOR MISCONDUCT. AND

00:50:59.389 --> 00:51:01.224
WE ENDED UP NOT ACHIEVING THE

00:51:01.291 --> 00:51:03.293
HIGH THRESHOLD WE NEEDED TO DO

00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:06.930
THAT- BUT I REMEMBER- OF LATE AT

00:51:06.997 --> 00:51:08.732
NIGHT I REMEMBER THINKING TO

00:51:08.799 --> 00:51:12.068
MYSELF. IF WE REMOVE THIS PERSON

00:51:12.135 --> 00:51:14.404
WHICH I SUPPORTED- WHICH I

00:51:14.471 --> 00:51:17.407
SUPPORTED- BUT IF IT HAPPENS

00:51:17.474 --> 00:51:23.613
WE'RE GONNA CHARGE THERE'S GOING. TO BE THIS CROWD IS GONNA COME

00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:25.282
RUNNING- THE GATE AND THE- AND I

00:51:25.348 --> 00:51:27.551
DON'T KNOW WHAT ON EARTH IS

00:51:27.617 --> 00:51:28.718
GOING TO HAPPEN IT WOULD NOT

00:51:28.785 --> 00:51:31.721
STATE. AND SO- IT IT IS- IT IS.

00:51:31.788 --> 00:51:34.124
REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE DO THIS

00:51:34.191 --> 00:51:36.526
BECAUSE THIS IS ABOUT. ENHANCING

00:51:36.593 --> 00:51:39.062
DEMOCRACY ME VERY CLEAR YEAH ONE

00:51:39.129 --> 00:51:41.331
PEOPLE DISRUPTING PUBLIC

00:51:41.398 --> 00:51:43.767
MEETINGS. THAT'S NOT PROMOTING

00:51:43.834 --> 00:51:45.168
DEMOCRACY THAT IS UNDERMINE

00:51:45.235 --> 00:51:46.770
DEMOCRACY THE FIRST OF ALL AND

00:51:46.837 --> 00:51:48.672
IT'S DESIGNED TO INTIMIDATE.

00:51:48.738 --> 00:51:50.474
ELECTED OFFICIALS SO THAT THEY

00:51:50.540 --> 00:51:53.076
DON'T THIS CHARGE THERE- AND

00:51:53.143 --> 00:51:53.877
DON'T REPRESENT THEIR COMMUNITY

00:51:53.944 --> 00:51:57.013
INTIMIDATION. AND IT CROWDS OUT

00:51:57.080 --> 00:51:59.216
AND INTIMIDATE OTHER MEMBERS OF

00:51:59.282 --> 00:52:01.284
THE PUBLIC. WHO ARE SCARED

00:52:01.351 --> 00:52:02.986
THEY'RE OF THE PUBLIC WHO WILL

00:52:03.053 --> 00:52:05.388
LEAVE A MEETING. BECAUSE THEY

00:52:05.455 --> 00:52:06.756
DON'T FEEL SAFE AND THEY DON'T

00:52:06.823 --> 00:52:08.592
WANNA GET INTO IT WITH THE

00:52:08.658 --> 00:52:11.695
PEOPLE. AT AND SO IT IS THIS

00:52:11.761 --> 00:52:13.830
KIND OF BEHAVIOR HURTS DEMOCRACY

00:52:13.897 --> 00:52:16.466
ANTI DEMOCRATIC THIS BILL

00:52:16.533 --> 00:52:17.901
ENHANCES DEMOCRACY BY MAKING

00:52:17.968 --> 00:52:19.736
SURE THAT EVERYONE CAN

00:52:19.803 --> 00:52:21.805
PARTICIPATE IN A SAFE WAY. I MET

00:52:21.872 --> 00:52:23.673
A LOT OF THAT ELECTED OFFICIALS

00:52:23.740 --> 00:52:25.308
ARE REPRESENTING THE ENTIRE

00:52:25.375 --> 00:52:27.210
COMMUNITY. AND NOT BEING

00:52:27.277 --> 00:52:32.282
INTIMIDATED TO DO OTHERWISE.

00:52:32.349 --> 00:52:34.451
VERY GOOD- YOU MAY ONE TO ADOPT

00:52:34.518 --> 00:52:37.387
THAT IS YOUR- I JUST HAVE TO SAY

00:52:37.454 --> 00:52:38.555
THAT I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING

00:52:38.622 --> 00:52:40.790
THAT'S BEEN SAID AND I THINK

00:52:40.857 --> 00:52:42.125
THE- THE IDEA OF THE CITIES

00:52:42.192 --> 00:52:43.727
HAVING A CO DISABILITIES IS

00:52:43.793 --> 00:52:46.263
REALLY IMPORTANT- WE DID THE

00:52:46.329 --> 00:52:49.199
SAME THING IT IN- IN OUR CITY

00:52:49.266 --> 00:52:52.469
AND- AND MADE IT VERY CLEAR

00:52:52.536 --> 00:52:53.403
WITHIN THE SPORTING EVENT SO

00:52:53.470 --> 00:52:54.738
PEOPLE WEREN'T FRIEDMAN- AND

00:52:54.804 --> 00:52:56.706
THEY WEREN'T FREE TO CLAP AND

00:52:56.773 --> 00:52:59.342
TO- HARASS AND- BOTHER PEOPLE

00:52:59.409 --> 00:53:01.478
WHEN THEY CAME TO THE MIKE AND I

00:53:01.545 --> 00:53:02.345
THINK THAT. THAT FUNDAMENTALLY

00:53:02.412 --> 00:53:05.415
CHANGE THE TONE THAT WE HAD- BUT

00:53:05.482 --> 00:53:07.817
I UNDERSTAND- THAT THINGS HAVE

00:53:07.884 --> 00:53:10.921
CHANGED AND IT'S GOTTEN MUCH

00:53:10.987 --> 00:53:13.690
WORSE- FOR A WHOLE HOST OF

00:53:13.757 --> 00:53:15.992
REASONS AND- I THINK THIS THIS

00:53:16.059 --> 00:53:17.894
GIVES THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT AN

00:53:17.961 --> 00:53:20.330
OPPORTUNITY. TO WARN. AND THEN

00:53:20.397 --> 00:53:22.032
TO RESPOND AND TO KEEP EVERYBODY

00:53:22.098 --> 00:53:23.600
SAFE AS AS I SAID WHEN WHAT

00:53:23.667 --> 00:53:26.269
THAT. I THINK WHAT WOULD CENTER

00:53:26.336 --> 00:53:27.604
WINNERS AS QUICKLY YOU MIGHT

00:53:27.671 --> 00:53:29.673
WANT TO PUT THAT INTENT LANGUAGE

00:53:29.739 --> 00:53:30.507
BECAUSE IT THEN FRAMES THIS IN A

00:53:30.574 --> 00:53:33.143
PRETTY GOOD WAY. 86% TESTICULAR

00:53:33.209 --> 00:53:35.345
AND- I DO AGREE THAT'S EXACTLY

00:53:35.412 --> 00:53:38.381
THE POINT. YEAH I DO AGREE. SO
