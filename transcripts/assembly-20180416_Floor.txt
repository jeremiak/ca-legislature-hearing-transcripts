SINCE NINETEEN FIFTY NINE THE ENTIRE COUNTRY OF ISRAEL HAS STOOD IN SILENCE FOR TWO MINUTES HE TAPED IT EACH APRIL TO REMEMBER AND COMMEMORATE THOSE WHO LOST THEIR LIVES DURING THE HOLOCAUST. THIS DAY IN HEBREW IS KNOWN AS YOM HASHOAH. TODAY WE MARK THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE WARSAW GHETTO UPRISING. IN APRIL AND MAY OF NINETEEN FORTY THREE. THE JEWISH COMMUNITY IN THE WARSAW GHETTO LED AN ARMED REVOLT AFTER RUMORS THAT THE GERMANS WOULD DEPORT THE REMAINING GET WHAT HAPPENS TO THE TREBLINKA KILLING CENTER. AS GERMAN AND POLICE UNITS ENTERED THE GHETTO MEMBERS OF THE JEWISH FIGHTING ORGANIZATION AND OTHER JEWISH GROUPS ATTACKED GERMAN TANKS. IT TOOK GERMAN FORCES NEARLY A MONTH BEFORE THEY WERE ABLE TO COMPLETELY PACIFY THE GHETTO. SUPPORT VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE REMAINING INHABITANTS. THIS ROOM OF THIS HORRIFIC MOMENT IN HISTORY IS DEEPLY PERSONAL TO ME. BECAUSE MY GRANDFATHER ROBERT ALTMAN WAS BROUGHT TO THIS COUNTRY BY HIS PARENTS IN NINETEEN OH EIGHT. THE REMAINING FAMILY. REMAINED IN WARSAW GERMANY. AND I REMEMBER SEEING FOR THE FIRST TIME A COPY OF MY FAMILY TREE ON BOTH MY GRANDMOTHER AND MY GRANDFATHER SIDE MY GRANDMOTHER'S FAMILY ALSO CAME TO THIS COUNTRY AROUND NINETEEN TEN. TO ESCAPE THE HORRIBLE CHO PROGRAMS. THAT WERE TERRORIZING JEWISH COMMUNITIES ACROSS EASTERN EUROPE. I'M WHAT'S STRIKING ABOUT THE FAMILY TREE IS THAT MY GRANDMOTHER'S FAMILY IS HERE MY GRANDFATHER'S FAMILY IS ON A DIFFERENT TREE. AND THERE WERE DOZENS OF OTHER COUSINS SISTERS UNCLES AND AUNTS. OUR FAMILY TREE CONTINUES TO MYSELF AND TO MY DAUGHTER. ALL OF THOSE OTHER FAMILY TREES THAT WARRANT MY GRANDFATHER SPENT FAMILY MY GRANDMOTHER'S FAMILY. THEY ALL ENDED. RIGHT AT THE END OF NINETEEN THIRTY. AND I CAN ONLY IMAGINE THAT MY GRANDFATHER'S FAMILY WHO WAS IN WARSAW. PROBABLY PERISHED IN THE WARSAW GHETTO. ALL OF THOSE LEGACIES. ALL OF THOSE POTENTIAL. AYERS. ALL THOSE MEMORIES OF WHAT THAT FAMILY THOSE FAMILIES WENT THROUGH WERE ALL ERASED ALL RACE BY THE GERMANS. YAMAHA SHOW UP THE HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE DAY. REMINDS THE WORLD TO NEVER FORGET. BUT WE ARE FORGETTING. AND WORSE. RIGHT NOW WITNESSING CONCERTED EFFORT TO ERASE HISTORY LET ME TELL YOU WHY THIS RESOLUTION IS SO IMPORTANT THIS MOMENT. THE CONFERENCE ON JEWISH MATERIAL CLAIMS AGAINST GERMANY OR THE CLAIMS CONFERENCE. JUST RELEASED FINDINGS OF A COMPREHENSIVE SURVEY OF AMERICANS. THE SURVEY SHOWS A REMARKABLE LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF THE HOLOCAUST. ESPECIALLY WITH OUR MILLENNIAL POPULATION AND THOSE YOUNGER. THE CLAIMS CONFERENCE SAID THAT QUOTE THERE ARE CRITICAL GAPS BOTH IN AWARENESS OF BASICS FACTS AS WELL AS DETAILED KNOWLEDGE OF THE HOLOCAUST. THIS IS IN AMERICAN SOCIETY AND THEY STRESS THE IMPORTANCE OF PEACE OF. STEPPING UP OUR EFFORTS TO EDUCATE OUR POPULATION AND OUR STUDENTS IN SCHOOLS. JUST UNDER A THIRD THIRTY ONE PERCENT OF THOSE AMERICANS SURVEYED DO NOT BELIEVE THAT SIX MILLION JEWS PERISHED DURING THE HOLOCAUST. THEY BELIEVE IN SAID THAT THE DEATH TOLL IS SOMEWHERE UNDER TWO MILLION. OR LOWER. THIS WAS TRUE FOR FORTY ONE PERCENT OF MILLENNIALS. ALMOST HALF OF AMERICANS. COULD NOT NAME A SINGLE CONCENTRATION CAMP. ALMOST HALF. TWO THIRDS SIXTY SIX PERCENT OF MILLENNIALS WERE UNABLE TO EXPLAIN OR RECOGNIZED WHAT AUSCHWITZ WAS THIS IS A WORD THAT'S BECOME SYNONYMOUS WITH GENOCIDE. AND YET THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANT. ELEVEN PERCENT OF AMERICANS SAID THAT IT'S ACCEPTABLE TO HOLD NEO AS WE ALL KNOW. LAST YEAR OUR OWN PRESIDENT. REFUSED TO CONDEMN A NEO* MARCH THAT LEAD TO DEATH IN THIS COUNTRY AND EVEN SAID THAT SOME OF THE PARTICIPANTS WERE GOOD PEOPLE. WHAT'S WORSE IS THE NUMBER OF A PROMINENT AMERICAN POLITICIANS AND THOUGHT LEADERS TO REFUSE TO STAND UP. AND PUBLICLY CONDEMNED THE PRESIDENT'S STATEMENT. AT THE SAME TIME AS AMERICANS ARE FORGETTING ABOUT THE HOLOCAUST THE FEBRUARY REPORT FROM THE SOUTHERN POVERTY LAW CENTER SHOW THAT THE NUMBER OF HATE GROUPS IN THE UNITED STATES. HAS INCREASED BY TWENTY PERCENT IN THE PAST THREE YEARS. THE NUMBER OF NEO* GROUPS HAS INCREASED FROM NINETY NINE AND TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY ONE AND TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. MEMBERS MANY OF THOSE GROUPS ARE HEADQUARTERED RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA. WE EVEN SEE THE UGLY FACE OF ANTI SEMITISM SHOWN PUBLICLY ON OUR COLLEGE CAMPUSES IN CALIFORNIA. HOW MANY AMERICANS THINK THAT HITLER ROSE TO POWER THROUGH FORCE THAT IT WASN'T OVER THROW SOME KIND OF MILITARY COUP IN GERMANY BUT IT WASN'T? AND THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER. HITLER CAME TO POWER THROUGH A DEMOCRATIC ELECTION. IN A COUNTRY THAT WAS ONE OF THE MOST EDUCATED AND AT THE TIME SOCIALLY PROGRESSIVE NATIONS ON EARTH. HE DIDN'T COME TO POWER ON A PLATFORM OF MASS MURDER NO. HE VERY INSIDIOUSLY BEGAN TO A ROAD THE CIVIL LIBERTIES IN GERMANY. TURN THE POPULATION AGAINST ONE ANOTHER BY MARGINALIZING MINORITY POPULATIONS. TO WILL ALLOW THOSE RATES TO BE ERODED OVER TIME. IT WAS HIS POPULIST VIEWS. AND THAT STRATEGY OF MARGINALIZING CITIZENS. AND TURNING CITIZENS AGAINST ONE ANOTHER AND AGAINST THEIR NEIGHBORS THAT LED TO THE HOLOCAUST. COLLEAGUES WE MUST STAND AGAINST THESE KINDS OF TACTICS WHEN WE SEE THEM IN OUR MYTHS. WHEN WE HAVE A CURRENT FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT DE THAT. THAT. HOLD ON TO POWER AND TRIES TO GAIN POWER BY MARGINALIZING MEMBERS OF OUR OWN SOCIETY. BECAUSE OF THEIR RELIGION. SIX A DENIED BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS BASED ON PEOPLE'S GENDER THEIR SEXUAL ORIENTATION. THEIR RACE THEIR RELIGION. TO DEPORT OUR RESIDENTS IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT TO SEPARATE FAMILIES FROM THEIR CHILDREN. WE MUST STAND OUT AGAINST THAT. CURRENTLY IN POLAND THE LAW WAS PASSED JUST RECENTLY. THAT MADE IT A CRIMINAL OFFENSE TO IMPLY THAT THE POLISH GOVERNMENT OR EVEN POLISH CITIZENS WERE IN ANY WAY COMPLICIT. IN THE HOLOCAUST. THANKFULLY THE STRONG SURVIVORS AND IN POLAND HAVE SAID THAT THEY WILL NOT BE SILENCED THEY WILL NOT BE AFRAID TO SPEAK THE TRUTH AND WE HAVE TO STAND IN SOLIDARITY WITH THEM. STAND UP AGAINST THAT KIND OF ERASURE OF HISTORY. I URGE. WELL I WANT FIRST OF ALL OF KNOWLEDGE THE SURVIVORS INERMIS TODAY. I THINK THEM FOR STANDING STRONG FOR BEING HERE TO BEAR WITNESS TO THAT HISTORY. WE MUST ALL PLEDGE TO STAND STRONG AGAINST HATRED INTOLERANCE AND ANTI SEMITISM AND THE ERASURE OF HISTORY. I URGE ALL OF YOU. A COOPER THIS RESOLUTION I WOULD ASK FOR THE COURT FIRST ROLE TO BE OPEN FOR COAUTHORS THANK YOU VERY MUCH MEMBERS MISTER SPEAKER. THANK YOU S. FREEMAN.

AS WE REMEMBER THE SIX MILLION JEWS WERE MURDERED BY THE* AND THE HOLOCAUST IS ALARMING TO KNOW. THAT INSTANCES OF ANTI SEMITISM THE UNITED STATES ROSE FIFTY SEVEN PERCENT. LAST YEAR. PERHAPS THAT SHOULDN'T BE SURPRISING IN A TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WEAR WHITE SUPREMACISTS BRAZENLY CHANTED. CHOOSE WILL NOT REPLACE US IN CHARLOTTESVILLE VIRGINIA IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. WE REMEMBER THE PAST SO WE DON'T REPEAT IT. ALARMINGLY. AS MY COLLEAGUE NOTED A RECENT POLL OF WHAT MILLENNIAL SHOWED THAT TWO THIRDS DIDNOT KNOW. WHAT AUSCHWITZ'S? SO LET ME TELL YOU. SO WE DON'T REPEAT IT. AFTER JEWS WERE STRIPPED OF THEIR CITIZENSHIP. IN CIVIL RIGHTS BY THE*. THEY WERE FORCIBLY MOVED INTO GHETTOS. THEN THEY WERE FORCED INTO CATTLE CARS. AND DELIVER TO CONCENTRATION AND DEATH CAMPS LIKE AUSCHWITZ. WHERE THEIR CLOTHING AND IDENTITIES WERE STRIPPED AWAY? REPLACED BY NUMBERS TATTOO TO THEIR ARMS. CHOOSE OR WORKED TO DEATH. STARVED TO DEATH. MARCH DID THAT. AND FINALLY GASSED TO DEATH. ULTIMATELY. SIX MILLION JEWS. AND FIVE MILLION EQUALLY INNOCENT LIVES. WERE MURDERED BY THE*. AND HOW THEIR FLASH BURNED FROM THEIR BONES TO ASHES IN PURSUIT OF ADOLF HITLER'S. FINAL SOLUTION. TO KILL ALL THE JEWS OF EUROPE. THAT'S WHAT OFFICES. AND THAT WAS JUST ONE OF SIX DEATH CAMPS. AMONG DOZENS OF CONCENTRATION CAMPS. TODAY WE ARE HONORED TO BE IN THE PRESENCE OF SURVIVORS OF THE HOLOCAUST. WE'RE ALSO JOINED BY THEIR DESCENDANTS. AND LIBERATORS WHO FREE EUROPE FROM HITLER AND THE*. I CANNOT THINK OUR HONOREES ENOUGH FOR BEING HERE THANK YOU. YOUR TRUE HEROES REMIND US THAT HOPE AND PERSEVERANCE CAN SURVIVE IN A WORLD.

A REGIME LED BY POL POT EXECUTED NEARLY A QUARTER OF CAMBODIA'S POPULATION. AS YOU REFLECT ON THESE FRIGHTENING TIMES.
