WITHOUT ANY ACTION. THANK YOU. LEAGUES POLICY STATES THAT SALES TAX AGREEMENTS INVOLVING ONLINE RETAILS SHOULD BE PROHIBITED GOING FORWARD BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE EFFECT OF ENCOURAGING REVENUE TO BE SHIFTED AWAY FROM NUMEROUS COMMUNITIES AND CONCENTRATE TO THE BENEFIT OF ONE AGENCY WITH A PORTION READ DEAR REBATED TO A RETAILER WITH THE INCREASING VOLUME OF INTERNET SALES A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF SALES TAX REVENUE CAN BE CONCENTRATING RETAILERS WAREHOUSE. SALES OFFICE OR FOR FILM AND SANDERS WHICH WHICH MAKES LOCATING THESE FACILITIES AN ENTICING PROSPECT FOR LOCAL AGENCIES AGREEMENT THAT BENEFITS ONE AGENCY BY SHIFTING THE POINT OF SALE CAN COME TO THE FISCAL HARM OF MANY OTHERS SO AGAIN I'M SPEAKING ABOUT THE VAST MAJORITY OF CITIES IN THIS STATE.

THANK YOU MISTER GRAYSON AMERICA'S RIGHT YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I ALSO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL YOU KNOW I'M LOOKING AT THE ANNOUNCES HIS BILL IS SUPPORTED NOT ONLY BY THE LEAGUE CALIFORNIA CITIES BUT ALSO THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION. THEY ARE IS A SUPPORTER BY BOTH THE CITIES AND THE LABOR FEDERATION BECAUSE THIS IS GOOD POLICY I MEAN IF IT'S A RACE TO THE BOTTOM OR CITIES I MEAN I RESPECT I RESPECT TO OUR COLLEAGUES THAT ARE FIGHTING FOR THE JOBS IN YOUR DISTRICTS BUT FROM A STATEWIDE PERSPECTIVE I MEAN IF THERE EVER RACE INTO THE BOTTOM TO TRY TO. COMPETE ONE CITY OF VERSES ANOTHER TO TRY TO ATTRACT THE JOBS YOUR CITIES IT'S A IT AGAIN LIKE A MISTER DOCTOR QUIRK INDICATE IT'S A RACE TO THE BOTTOM IS BAD POLICY YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT'S GOOD FOR THE ENTIRE STATE IS THAT WE. BUT WE STOP THIS RACE TO THE BOTTOM I SUPPORT THIS BILL. THANK YOU. MISTER MURATSUCHI MISTER PATTERSON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AGAIN MEMBERS ARE RISE IN OPPOSITION. THIS IS GOING TO PARTICULARLY SAT BACK. UP MANY OF THE CITIES IN CENTRAL CALIFORNIA INCLUDING THE CITY OF FRESNO. THESE ARE TOOLS IN THE TOOLBOX THAT ARE AVAILABLE AND THEY'RE AVAILABLE FOR EVERYBODY. AND BECAUSE IN A COMPETITION FOR IDEAS A COMPETITION FOR OPPORTUNITY THERE WILL BE SOME WHO WILL LOSE AND SOME WHO WILL WIN. THE BOTTOM LINE HERE IS PLACES LIKE FRESNO. THAT HAVE HAD DOUBLE DIGIT UNEMPLOYMENT FOR A LONG TIME. WE ARE NOW SEEING THAT DOUBLE DIGIT UNEMPLOYMENT SUBSTANTIALLY IN SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED. WE HAVE BEEN ASKED REPEATEDLY STATE WIDE PLEASE DIVERSIFY YOUR ECONOMY. WHEN WE DIVERSIFY OUR ECONOMY WE ARE NOW LOOKING AT ESSENTIALLY A PENALTY GOING FORWARD THOUSANDS OF NEW JOBS HAVE BEEN CREATED. WE HAVE. COMPANIES OF SIGNIFICANT STATURE. WITH HUGE NAME IDENTIFICATION. IN OUR COMMUNITY. THAT SAYS SOMETHING ABOUT HOW MUCH WE WELCOME THOSE BUSINESSES. AND WHY FRESNO WHAT TO BE LOOKED AT FOR NOT AS AN OPPORTUNITY CITY. PLEASE DON'T ON RAVEL A GOOD POLICY THAT HAS BEEN USED VERY SUCCESSFULLY BY SOME OF THE CITY'S MOST IMPACTED BY ON EMPLOYMENT WE'RE DIGGING OURSELVES OUT OF THAT DOUBLE DIGIT UNEMPLOYMENT THANK GOODNESS AND THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO SO PLEASE DON'T ON WIND AN OPPORTUNITY FOR OTHER PEOPLE TO CENTRAL CALIFORNIA. AND I WOULD SUGGEST TO OTHER MUNICIPALITIES AND OTHERS ROLL YOUR SLEEVES UP. COMPETE AND YOU PROBABLY WILL WIN YOUR SHARE AND SO I'M ASKING PLEASE ON BEHALF OF THOSE WORKING IN THESE JOBS IN OUR AREAS AND WILL BE WORKING IN ON THEM IN FUTURE IN OUR COMMUNITY. AGAIN I'M ASKING FOR A NO VOTE THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER PATTERSON. SEE IN HEARING NO FURTHER DEBATE ON THE MATTER DOCTOR QUIRK YOU MAY CLOSE. SO IF WE PASS THIS BILL. A CITY COULD STILL SAY WELL WE'LL GIVE YOU A BREAK ON REAL ESTATE TAX WILL GIVE YOU A BREAK ON ANOTHER TAX WHAT THEY CAN'T DO. IS TAKE AWAY TAX FROM OTHER CITIES WHICH IS WHAT HAPPENS NOW IT'S UNFAIR AND ALSO UNNECESSARY THE REASON YOU HAVE THESE WAREHOUSES IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY AND IN SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY IS VERY SIMPLE IT'S A GOOD PLACE TO HAVE A WAREHOUSE. THEY THEN COME IN THE BIG COMPANIES COME IN AND THEY SAY WILL YOU GIVE US A BREAK AND SALES TAX WILL YOU GIVE US A BREAK AND SALES TAX FINALLY ONE CITY DECIDES TO GIVE THEM A BREAK AND THEY GO THERE THAT'S UNFAIR COMPETITION AND THAT'S ALSO DEPRIVING. OF THE CITIES OF THEIR SALES TAX REVENUE IF WE ARE ALL ON A LIVING PLAYING FIELD IF YOU ALL HAVE OTHER WAYS TO INDUCE PEOPLE YOU STILL HAVE THE TOOLS YOU NEED. SO PLEASE THIS IS A MATTER OF FAIRNESS TO ALL THE CITIES THAT'S WHY THE LEAGUE SUPPORTS IT AND ALSO WHY THE LABOR FEDERATION SUPPORTS IT I ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU DOCTOR QUIRK THE CLERK WILL OPEN THE ROLE. MEMBERS OF THOSE WHO DESIRE TO VOTE. HOME MEMBERS THOSE WHO DESIRE TO VOTE. ALL MEMBERS THOSE WHO DESIRE TO VOTE. CLERK WILL LOSE THE ROLE IN TALLY THE VOTE AYE THIS MEASURE PASSES ARE ON THE ASSEMBLY THIRD READING FILE. FILE ITEM SIXTY TWO THROUGH SIXTY SIX. PASS AND RETAIN ITEM NUMBER SIXTY SEVEN. THIS IS A SEE A SIX BY MR MCCARTY CORPORATE ASSEMBLY CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT SIX BY SOME REMEMBER MCCARTY AND OTHERS AND ACTUALLY TO ELECTIONS MR MCCARTY. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I PRESENT ACA SIX WHICH WOULD PLACE ON THE BALLOT A MEASURE TO RESTORE VOTING RIGHTS FOR THOSE FORMALLY INCARCERATED. UNITED STATES IS THE ENVY OF THE WORLD WHEN IT COMES TO DEMOCRACY BUT VOTING HASN'T ALWAYS BEEN THAT WAY FROM OUR JIM CROW RACIALLY BASED POLL TAXES TO EXCLUDING WOMEN TO VOTE WE'VE HAD TO FIGHT FOR VOTING JUSTICE FOR A LONG TIME. IS ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE ISSUES IN CALIFORNIA THAT WE PROBABLY TALK ABOUT OUR PROGRESSIVE IDEALS AND WE'VE EXPANDED VOTING RIGHTS BUT IN THIS ISSUE WHERE FRANKLY BEHIND MANY STATES ACROSS OUR NATION. WE HALF THE STATES IN OUR COUNTRY ARE AHEAD OF US IN REGARDS LIVING THOSE PEOPLE WITH CONVICTIONS ON PAROLE VOTES THIS ISN'T A RED STATE OR BLUE STATE ISSUE IT'S A QUESTION ABOUT OUR VALUES AND SOUNDS. LIKE POLICY THAT'S WHY STATES LIKE NEVADA MAIN UTAH LOUISIANA ARE LEADING THE WAY THE LAST FEW MONTHS FLORIDA COLORADO AND NEVADA HAVE ALSO JOINED THE EFFORTS. AND WHY HAVE RED STATES AND CONSERVATIVES LIKE NEWT GINGRICH GROVER NORQUIST. AND THE COOK BROTHERS. ACTUALLY OF COURSE ONE OF RECENTLY PASSED WHY HAVE THEY JOINED THE ACLU AND THE FREE THE VOTE COALITION TO SUPPORT THIS ISSUE. BECAUSE IT'S MORALLY RIGHT ABOUT IT CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT ARE VOTING BUT ALSO IT SOUNDS FOR PUBLIC SAFETY. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT OUR PAROLE AND PROBATION OFFICERS WHO WERE ON THE FRONT LINES WHEN IT COMES TO WORKING WITH INDIVIDUALS ON PAROLE. AND THEY I THINK SUMMIT UP VERY SUS THINK WAY. STATING THAT GIVING PEOPLE RETURNING HOME FROM PRISON AXE TO SIT TO CIVIC PARTICIPATION IS ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAYS. TO ASSURE THEIR SUCCESSFUL REINTEGRATION BACK IN OUR COMMUNITIES. FURTHER AD BLOCKING PEOPLE ON PAROLE FROM VOTING MEANS OUR NEIGHBORS WHO ARE WORKING PAYING TAXES RAISING THEIR FAMILIES IN THE STATE. ARE DEPRIVED OF THE VISIT ABILITY TO HAVE A SAY IN THE POLICIES AND ISSUES OF OUR DAY. SO AGAIN YOU ASKED THE PEOPLE WHO WORK WITH THESE INDIVIDUALS THE MOST ARE PEARL OFFICERS AND PROBATION OFFICERS THEY SAY THIS IS SOUND PUBLIC POLICY. IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT VOTING RIGHTS IS ABOUT REINTEGRATION OF OUR COMMUNITIES. THERE BEEN SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT EXEMPTING CERTAIN INDIVIDUAL CERTAIN OFFENDERS FROM VOTING AND I WOULD JUST SAY THAT'S REALLY A DISTINCTION WITHOUT A DIFFERENCE BECAUSE YOU CAN BE AN OFFENDER. ON PROBATION WITH A CERTAIN OFFENSE AND VOTE YOU CAN HAVE A CERTAIN OFFENSE THAT WE DEEMED. VERY TROUBLE TO TALK ABOUT IT IN OUR OWN COMMUNITIES WHO ARE WHO OUR SERVE THEIR THEIR PAROLE TERM CAN VOTE. SO THIS IS ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE ACROSS THE BOARD FAIRNESS IN VOTING RIGHTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THEN LASTLY I HAVE AN OPINION ON THIS I KNOW MY COLLEAGUES HAVE A SEPARATE OPINION ON THIS THIS IS GONNA ASK THIS IS ASKING US TO MAKE THAT CHOICE IS ASKING US. TO ASK THE VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA IN TWENTY TWENTY TO WEIGH IN THIS ISSUE WHY ASK THE VOTERS BECAUSE THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES THE ELECTORATE LOCKED IN WHO WAS ELIGIBLE TO VOTE WE CAN ONLY MAKE THIS CHANGE BY GOING TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. I RESPECTFULLY ASK THE ARRIVAL THANK YOU. THINGS REGARDING MR GALLAGHER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS AND I HAVE TO COMMEND THE GENTLEMAN FROM SACRAMENTO THIS IS PROBABLY THE FIRST TIME HE'S EVER CITED NEWT GINGRICH AND THE COOK BROTHERS. TO GET SUPPORT FOR A BILL. BUT ALL THAT ASIDE YOU KNOW WE HAD THIS BILL IN THE ELECTIONS COMMITTEE AND THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS. SENDS ON PAROLE HAVE NOT FINISH THEIR SENTENCE. I'VE BEEN RELEASED EARLY AND THEY'VE BEEN RELEASED ON CONDITIONS ON PAROLE AND THEIR REQUIREMENTS THAT THEY HAVE TO MEET TO SHOW THAT YES THEY CAN BE THAT THEY ARE RE INTEGRATED BACK INTO SOCIETY. AND LET'S NOT FORGET. THESE PERSONS HAVE CREATED VERY HAVE COMMITTED VERY SERIOUS CRIMES MURDERS. RAPES. THESE ARE THINGS THAT. CHANGE PEOPLE'S LIVES FOR EVER PEOPLE THAT WERE MURDERED THEY'LL NEVER GET TO VOTE AGAIN. NO NEVER GET TO PARTICIPATE IN OUR CIVIC ENGAGEMENT AGAIN. PEOPLE HAVE BEEN RAPED THEIR LIVES ARE CHANGED FOR EVER. SO NO THEY HAVEN'T COMPLETED THEIR PENNANTS THEY HAVEN'T COMPLETED. THEIR SENTENCE WHEN THEY'RE ON PRO ONCE THEY'RE OFF PAROLE WE ALLOW THEM TO VOTE. THAT'S FAIR. THAT IS MORE THAN FAIR. AND WE SHOULD CONSIDER THAT WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. THIS ISSUE. I ALSO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO THINK ABOUT. YES YOU KNOW OUR OUR DEMOCRACY ONCE. YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'VE COMMITTED CRIMES AGAINST OTHER PEOPLE CERTAIN RIGHTS GET TAKEN AWAY. AND I DOUBT THAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM SACRAMENTO. WOULD BE ADVOCATING THAT PAROLEES GET THEIR SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS RESTORED. FATHER ON PAROLE WHAT HE AND TRUST THEM WITH OWNING A POSSESSING A FIREARM AS THEIR REQUIRE AS THEY HAVE A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO DO UNDER THE SECOND AMENDMENT. BUT HE WANTS TO RESTORE THEIR VOTING RIGHTS YOU WON'T TRUST HIM WITH THE GUN. BUT YOU'D LIKE TO ENTRUST THEM WITH OUR DEMOCRACY. NOW LOOK THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE. WHO HAVE COMMITTED CRIMES HAVE DONE THEIR PENNANTS AND THEY ARE WORKING TO BE REHABILITATED BACK AND TO SOCIETY I BELIEVE. M. REPENTANCE I BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE CAN BE CHANGE THAT PEOPLE CAN BE RE REHABILITATED. BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THEY SHOULDN'T FACE CONSEQUENCES. FOR WHAT THEY HAVE DONE. THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE SHOULD FORGET ABOUT THEIR VICTIMS. AND WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM. IN THAT YES ONCE THAT SENDS IS COMPLETE THEN YES THEY SHOULD FULLY BE PARTICIPATING THEIR DEMOCRACY AND THEY DO. SO I THINK IT'S A PRETTY SIMPLE CHOICE FOR US TODAY THERE'S REALLY NOTHING WRONG WITH CURRENT LAW AND WE SHOULD KEEP IT THAT WAY WE DON'T NEED TO CHANGE IT THANK YOU AVERAGE REAR NO VOTE. ON THIS A CA. MISS KOREA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I AM PROUD TO BE A CO AUTHOR OF A CA SIX AN AMENDMENT THAT HONORS THE DIGNITY OF PEOPLE WHO WERE PREVIOUSLY INCARCERATED NEARLY FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE ON PEARL IN CALIFORNIA ARE WORKING PAYING TAXES AND POSITIVELY CONTRIBUTING TO OUR COMMUNITIES HOWEVER TOO OFTEN THESE RESTRICTIONS ON THOSE WERE INCARCERATED EXTEND BEYOND THEIR TIME SERVED MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY WHO HAVE PAID THEIR DEBT TO SOCIETY SHOULD NOT BE PREVENTING FROM EXERCISING THIS VERY FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT. WE WANT OPPORTUNITY REDEMPTION SAFETY SUCCESS NOT OBSTACLES VOTING IS THE FOUNDATION OF OUR DEMOCRACY AND CURRENTLY PAROLEES ARE UNABLE TO VOTE AT ANY LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT ACA SIX ALLOWS CALIFORNIA TO RESTORE THE RIGHT TO VOTE TO NEARLY FIFTY THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS ON PAROLE. OUR DEMOCRACY IS ROOTED IN THE PRINCIPLE THAT EVERY SINGLE VOICE MATTERS AND PROMOTING CIVIC ENGAGEMENT AKES OUR COMMUNITY STRONGER IT IS A LONG OVERDUE THAT CALIFORNIANS WHO HAVE SERVED THEIR TIME ARE PROVIDED A PATHWAY TO FULL INTEGRATION BACK INTO SOCIETY AND WHAT WE ARE ASKING IS THAT WE ALLOW THE CALIFORNIA VOTER TO MAKE THIS DECISION. AND I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. NAME IS CARRILLO MISTER KALRA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I RISE AS A CO AUTHOR IN FULL SUPPORT OF A CA SIX AS THE AUTHORS STATED. IT IS NOT SIMPLY JUST THE MORALLY RIGHT THING TO DO BUT IT IS. GOOD FOR OUR COMMUNITY IT IS WHAT WILL MAKE US SAFER AS A COMMUNITY AND WE'RE PAYING WE'RE PLAYING CATCH UP HERE. BUT A LOT OF OTHER STATES WE KNOW THAT WHEN WE LOWER RECIDIVISM THAT IS GOOD FOR A COMMUNITIES WE KNOW THOSE THAT ARE BE INTEGRATED INTO OUR COMMUNITY AND BOATING HAS BEEN SHOWN AS A WAY TO BE. RE INTEGRATED INTO OUR COMMUNITY THE LIKELIHOOD OF THEM COMMITTING A CRIME AGAIN IS REDUCE AND THAT'S WHY THERE IS SUPPORT FROM THOSE THAT HAVE THE MISSION OF MONITORING THOSE THAT ARE RELEASED. BUT TO GIVE THEM THE RIGHT TO VOTE. ALSO AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I DOUBLE CHECKED WITH SOME OF MY FORMER. COLLEAGUES IN THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE. THEY DOES THAT ARE EITHER FOUND GUILTY OR PLEAD GUILTY ARE NOT INFORMED OF THE FACT THAT THEY'RE GIVING UP. THEIR RIGHT TO VOTE. AND SO IF YOU'RE GONNA BE TAKING THIS RIGHT AWAY AND YOU'RE NOT INFORMING ONE. ABOUT WHAT EXACTLY IS THE PURPOSE OF DOING IT OTHER THAN TAKING AWAY. THEIR ABILITY TO EXERCISE THEIR VOICE IN THEIR DEMOCRACY. ULTIMATELY WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT PAROLE THE GOOD A PAROLE. AND THE PURPOSE OF PRO THE GOAL OF PRO IS NOT EARLY SHOULD NOT BE PUNISHMENT. IT IS ABOUT REINTEGRATION. INTO SOCIETY. AND THERE ARE PLENTY OF MEASURES THAT DEAL WITH THE ABILITY TO FURTHER PUNISH IF SOMEONE FAILS ON PAROLE BUT BY TAKING AWAY THE RIGHT TO VOTER ALLOWING THE RIGHT TO VOTE REALLY DOESN'T SPEAK. TO THE GOAL OF PAROLE FRANKLY ALLOWING FOR REINTEGRATION SHOULD ALLOW YOU TO PARTICIPATE IN YOUR DEMOCRACY. AND ULTIMATELY LET'S THINK ABOUT THE FOUNDATION OF Y. PAROLEES ARE THOSE THAT HAVE CONVICTIONS ON THE RECORD OR THOSE. THAT HAVE TROUBLED PASS AND SO ON AND SO FORTH. ARE TAKEN THE RIGHT TO VOTE IS TAKEN AWAY THAT FOUNDATION IS IN SLAVERY AND IN POST RECONSTRUCTION LAWS THAT SOON AFTER SLAVERY THE REALITY IS THAT THAT IS WHEN WE STARTED SEEING LAWS THAT SAID IF YOU'RE ON PAROLE OR IF YOU HAVE CONVICTIONS. BUT YOU SHOULD NOT BUILD A VOTE AND WE KNOW QUITE CLEARLY. UP THROUGH OUR HISTORY THAT THOSE THAT HAD BEEN INTENSELY CAUGHT UP IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM ARE PREDOMINANTLY PEOPLE OF COLOR AND POOR PEOPLE TAKING WITH THE RIGHT TO VOTE WAS QUITE INTENTIONALLY DONE NOT TO PUNISH BUT TO TAKE THEIR VOICE AWAY FROM THEIR DEMOCRACY. AND TO ALLOW FOR AN ELECTORATE THAT DOES NOT REPRESENT OUR COMMUNITY SO I URGE ALL MY COLLEAGUES TO I'LL GO OUT THE VOTERS TO DECIDE. IF THEY WOULD LIKE TO JOIN SO MANY OTHER STATES IN ALLOWING PAROLEES THE RIGHT TO VOTE THANK YOU. THINGS KALRA MISSED. YOUR RECORD THIS IS SPEAKER COLLEAGUES. I AM A LAW AND ORDER PERSON CONSERVATIVE IF I WAS A JUDGE IDEA HANG AND JUDGE. NOW I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH DIFFERENT REHABILITATION PROGRAMS FOR CONVICTS ONE OF MY FAVORITES IN MY DISTRICT IS RISE UP. MY. CALLING FROM CARSON WORKS WITH HOME BOYS ANDERS OF AT MY LAST COUNT SEVENTEEN OTHER RE HAVE ORGANIZATIONS SOLD MY RISE UP. PROVIDES TRAINING. HIGH LEVEL COMPUTER MACHINERY. THEY BECOME MACHINISTS OVER AN EIGHTEEN MONTH PERIOD NOW THESE PEOPLE. HAVE SERVE FORTY YEARS THIRTY YEARS IN PRISON. AND. THEY WERE IN A HOPELESS SITUATION. THESE PROGRAMS RESTORE HOPE. I COULD SEE IT NOW RISE. IT IS AN ATTITUDE CHANGE FOR MAY. ONE OF THE TENETS OF CHRISTIANITY IS THE FORGIVENESS. ALL THE WAY THROUGH. WHAT HAPPENS IS. THESE PEOPLE NOW HAVE A MINIMUM WAGE JOB. THEY'RE BEING TRAINED AND IN EIGHTEEN MONTHS THEY CAN GET A THIRTY DOLLAR AN HOUR JOB THIRTY FIVE DOLLAR AN HOUR JOB. THEY SUFFER FROM PTSD AND ALL THE MELODIES OF BEING A LIFETIME IN PRISON. SO I SUPPORT ACA'S SIX BECAUSE IT'S ANOTHER FUNDAMENTAL RESTORATION OF WHOLE. YOU CAN'T BELIEVE HOW MUCH IT MEANS TO A LIFE FOR. NOT TO I'M WORKING WITH RIGHT NOW. TO BE ABLE TO VOTE. AND WORK ON BECOMING A CITIZEN NOW IF THEY MESS IT UP. GO BACK TO PRISON GO OF PAROLE THEY CAN'T VOTE. SO I'M A GAMBLING MAN I'M WILLING TO PLACE MY CHIPS. ON A CA SIX THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MULTIPLE METAPHORS THERE MR STONE YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER SO EITHER BELIEVE IN REHABILITATION WE DON'T. WE BELIEVE IN THE IN ALL PEOPLE PARTICIPATING TO THE GREATEST EXTENT POSSIBLE IN OUR DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM OR WE DON'T CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS PEOPLE WHO ARE OUT ON PAROLE OUT ON PROBATION ARE THERE BECAUSE THEY HAVE EARNED THE TRUST OF THE SYSTEM. TO COME BACK INTO OUR COMMUNITIES AND PARTICIPATE IN OUR COMMUNITIES. THEY HAVE THE RIGHT AND SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN ELECTIONS IF YOU'RE THAT AFRAID OF ASKING THE VOTERS THIS QUESTION OR IF YOU ARE THAT AFRAID. OF HAVING PEOPLE VOTES. WHO YOU MAY DISAGREE WITH ALL RIGHT. THEN YOU SHOULD BE AFRAID ENOUGH TO NOT SUPPORT THIS IF YOU BELIEVE IN REHABILITATION AND IF YOU BELIEVE IN MAKING SURE PEOPLE PARTICIPATES TO THE GREATEST EXTENT POSSIBLE WE HAVE TO PUT THIS ON THE BALLOT WE HAVE TO BRING CALIFORNIA UP WITH ALL THESE OTHER STATES. AND LET'S GIVE PEOPLE A REAL CHANCE TO BE IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND HAVE THEIR VOICES HEARD I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF A CA SIX. FAMOUS DAMAGE MURATSUCHI YOUR RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AS A FORMER PROSECUTOR I RISE IN SUPPORT OF A CA SIX. I'M LOOKING AT THE- MY NOTES HERE AND ACCORDING TO A CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT CASE. PEOPLE VERSUS KNUCKLES PAROLE IS LEGALLY NOT PART OF A PRISON TERM. THIS IS A SUPERVISED RE ENTRY PERIOD AFTER COMPLETION OF A PRISON TERM SO. YOU KNOW. QUITE HONESTLY I'M USUALLY NOT RISING IN SUPPORT OF CRIME BILLS THAT COME FROM MY COLLEAGUE FROM SACRAMENTO. BUT I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A GOOD PUBLIC SAFETY BILL. BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT. GIVING A STAKE IN THE COMMUNITY. BY EXERCISING THE RIGHT TO VOTE. IS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN THE REHABILITATION AND CUTTING DOWN ON THE RECIDIVISM. ALL OF CRIMINALS THAT IS WHY IF YOU LOOK ON THE BILL ANALYSIS ALL OF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT GROUPS ARE NEUTRAL ON THIS BILL. SO FOR PUBLIC SAFETY REASONS. AND ALSO I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS NOT. NO I DON'T SEE THIS IS GIVING A RIGHT. CRIMINALS BUT I SEE THIS IS GIVING A RESPONSIBILITY. A RESPONSIBILITY TO ENGAGE IN SOCIETY A RESPONSIBILITY TO ENGAGE. AND FOR THAT REASON I'M SUPPORTING THIS BILL THANK YOU MISS MURATSUCHI MINS KAMLAGER-DOVE. YOUR RECORD. THANK YOU I AT STAND IN JOYFUL SHOCK WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE SOUTH BAY. JOINING ARMS WITH US IN SUPPORT. OF THIS BILL I AM A PROUD CO AUTHOR OF A CA SIX WHICH WILL RESTORE THE RIGHT TO VOTE TO PEOPLE ON PAROLE YOU KNOW. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT CRIMINAL JUSTICE ISSUES THERE'S A LOT OF JUDGMENT IN THE COMMENTS THAT WE MAKE BUT REAL TALK. PAROLEES ARE OUR NEIGHBORS THEY ARE OUR FAMILY MEMBERS THEY ARE COLLEAGUES THEY ARE NOT THE BOOGIE MEN AND WOMEN IN THE SHADOWS. THEY HAVE BEEN RELEASED FROM PRISON BECAUSE THEY ARE NO LONGER CONSIDERED A THREAT TO OUR SOCIETY. AND YET WE'VE DECIDED THAT THEY ARE TOO DANGEROUS TO RE EXERCISE THEIR RIGHT TO VOTE. THAT IS ABSURD. THIS AMENDMENT IS ABOUT RE ENFRANCHISEMENT. YOU GET THE RIGHT TO VOTE WHEN YOU ARE EIGHTEEN YOU LOSE IT WHEN YOU ARE INCARCERATED TEMPORARILY. WE'RE SAYING IT SHOULDN'T BE FOR EVER. YOU COME OUT WITH HIGH EXPECTATIONS OF PAYING TAXES OF BEING INTEGRAL TO THE ECONOMIC AND THE SOCIAL FABRIC OF OUR SOCIETY AND YET WE TELL YOU YOU CAN'T HAVE A VOICE. THAT MAKES NO SENSE. AND YOU WILL NEVER GET THE KINDS OF LOW RECIDIVISM RATES AND INTEGRATION THAT YOU WANT IF YOU CONTINUE TO MARGINALIZE PEOPLE AND KEEP THEM IN THE SHADOWS BECAUSE OF FEAR AND JUDGMENT. FOURTEEN OTHER STATES INCLUDING THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA HAVE STEPPED UP TO THE PLATE. CALIFORNIA IT IS OUR TIME. WE KNOW THAT THIS DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTS PEOPLE OF COLOR WE KNOW THAT IT DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTS WOMEN THE FASTEST GROWING POPULATION IN OUR PRISONS. SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT EQUITY WHEN WE TALK ABOUT JUSTICE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT RIGHT. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT REHABILITATION. LET'S NOT TALK ABOUT IT IN FALSE TERMS. THE RIGHT TO VOTE. IS FOUNDATIONAL TO WHO WE CLAIM TO BE AS AMERICANS. AND IF YOU ARE ON PAROLE. YOU SHOULD HAVE THAT RIGHT. I URGENT I VOTE ON A CA SIX. THINGS CAN LEARN OF MS MELENDEZ YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER LADIES AND JOHN I RISE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BUT I HAVE A QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR. WITHOUT OBJECTION. IT ARE THERE ANY RESTRICTIONS ON THIS BILL RELATING TO WHO WOULD BE ELIGIBLE TO VOTE IN OTHER WORDS DOES IT ANY RESTRICTIONS RELATING TO THE ANY PARTICULAR CRIME ARE SOME EXCLUDED OR IS IT EVERYONE THAT HE WOULD BE ELIGIBLE. THIS MCCARTY SHARE IT WOULD RELATE TO ANYBODY WHO IS PEARL CURRENTLY WHEN YOUR PAROLE SENTENCE IS DONE YOU CAN VOTE WE DO NOT HAVE ANY COUNTY GIRL THINGS I'M SINCE IN THIS MEASURE OKAY THANK YOU. SO I GUESS WE SHOULD TALK THEN ABOUT THE ELIGIBILITY AND THOSE WHO WOULD BE ELIGIBLE TO VOTE. SO I TALKED TO MY LAW ENFORCEMENT FOLKS FROM THREE DIFFERENT COUNTIES ASK FOR SOME EXAMPLES. ALL WHO ARE ON PAROLE HAVE BEEN RE ARRESTED THESE ARE ALL WITHIN A YEAR BY THE WAY BEING PAROLED. THE FIRST ONE IS A CONVICTED RAPIST. GOT PAROLED AND THEN WHILE HE WAS OUT ON PAROLE DECIDED HE WAS GOING TO THROW ACID ON PEOPLE'S FACES IN ORDER TO ROB THEM. HE WOULD GET TO VOTE. THE SECOND ONE CONVICTED OF ASSAULT AND ATTEMPTED RAPE. WENT TO PRISON GOT OUT VIOLATED PAROLE ALSO FAILED TO REGISTER AS A SEX OFFENDER HE WOULD GET ABOUT THE THIRD ONE WAS CONVICTED OF CHILD MOLESTATION WAS PAROLED. AND THEN WAS ARRESTED AGAIN FOR FAILURE TO REGISTER AS A SEX OFFENDER HE GETS ABOUT. THE FOURTH ONE FORCIBLE RAPE GOT PAROLED FAILED TO REGISTER. GOT ARRESTED AGAIN FIFTY ONE CHILD MOLESTATION GOT ARRESTED WENT TO PRISON GOT PAROLED AND WAS ARRESTED AGAIN FOR HAVING CHILD JUST A CASE IN GARDEN GROVE I'M SURE YOU ALL SAW THE VIDEO. AND THE GUY WHO WENT ON A STABBING SPREE. HE BEEN IN PRINT IN AND OUT OF PRISON FOURTEEN TIMES SINCE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. HE WOULD GET ABOUT. SO. I'M JUST WONDERING AT WHAT POINT WE ARE GOING TO STOP. FOCUSING ALL OF OUR EFFORTS ON THOSE WHO BREAK THE LAW AND START FOCUSING ON VICTIMS AND THEIR RIGHTS. YOU THE AVERAGE TIME A PAROLE IN CALIFORNIA IS THREE TO FIVE YEARS THAT IS NOT A LOT OF TIME TO ASK SOMEONE TO LIVE BY THE SAME STANDARDS AT THE REST OF US LIVE BY IT'S NOT A LOT OF TIME. YOU GO TO PRISON FOR SOME VERY SERIOUS CRIMES AND WHEN YOU GET PAROLED. IT IS WITH RESTRICTIONS YOU. THE FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION YOU WERE TOLD TO STAY AWAY FROM CERTAIN PEOPLE YOU DON'T HAVE THE FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT. YOU CAN'T JUST UP AND LEAVE AND GO TO ANOTHER STATE OR ANOTHER COUNTY. THERE ARE RESTRICTIONS THAT'S FOR RECENT. BECAUSE THE SYSTEM ISN'T QUITE CONVINCED THAT YOU ARE WILLING TO FOLLOW THE LAWS THAT EVERYONE ELSE MUST FOLLOW. THIS IS THE SAME FOR VOTING. CALIFORNIANS WHEN THEY ARE PAROLED AND THEY FINISH THEIR PRO THEY GET THEIR VOTING RIGHTS BACK ONE OF FOUR STATES THAT ALLOW THAT THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT ONCE YOU'VE SHOWN DID YOU ARE WILLING TO LIVE BY THE STANDARDS IN THE RULES OF SOCIETY IS SET. IS IT APPROPRIATE FOR SOME OF THE PEOPLE THAT I MENTIONED TO BE VOTING. FOR THEIR COUNTY SHERIFF. IS IT APPROPRIATE FOR THEM TO BE VOTING FOR THE PEOPLE WHO MAKE THE LAWS. DO YOU WANT TO STAND THERE AND LOOK IN THE EYES OF THE FATHER WHOSE DAUGHTER WAS BRUTALLY RAPED. A PAROLED AND TELL HIM THAT YOU THINK THE MAN THAT HARM HIS DAUGHTER HAS THE SAME RIGHTS. AS HE DOES TO VOTE. ARE YOU GONNA STAND THERE AND LOOK IN THE EYES OF THE MOTHER. WHOSE DAUGHTER WAS SODOMIZED HE WAS BURLY RATE TO THE POINT WHERE SHE CAN'T HAVE CHILDREN LOOK INTO THE EYES OF THE MOTHER. WHOSE SON. WAS MOLESTED OR RAPED BY SOMEONE. SO EMOTIONALLY DAMAGE THAT HE COMMITTED SUICIDE I CAN LOOK IN THEIR EYES AND TELL THEM THAT YOU THINK THAT THAT PERSON HAS THE SAME RIGHTS SHOULD BE TREATED THE SAME AS EVERYONE ELSE ARE YOU KIDDING ME. THIRTY SECONDS. NO ONE IS SAYING THAT RIGHT ART SHOULD BE TAKEN AWAY FOREVER. BUT IT IS ABSURD TO ME AND LOGICAL FOR YOU TO SUGGEST THAT SOMEHOW THESE PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT YET PAID THEIR DEBT TO SOCIETY SHOULD HAVE THE SAME RIGHTS. AS A LAW ABIDING CITIZENS IN AS OF THE BIG ITEMS THAT THEY HARMED. I ORIGINAL VOTE. DOCTOR WEBER. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RISE AS A PROUD CO AUTHOR ON THIS BILL. YOU KNOW FOR THE LAST. WHAT IS IT NOW SEVEN YEARS I HAVE DEALT WITH THE ISSUE OF WHO SHOULD VOTE ON WHO SHOULD NOT VOTE AND HOW WE HAVE CERTAIN RIGHTS THAT NEED TO EXIST. AND EVERY TIME WE HAVE A STATION WE GO TO THE MOST EXTREME EXAMPLES OF INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE THE SYSTEM HAS FAILED. THIS WILL NOT ONLY TO IDENTIFY WHO ARE BUT A DIGNIFIED THEIR NEEDS AND TO PROPERLY DEAL WITH THEM AS THEY SHOULD. WE CAN'T BASE OUR POLICY ON SOME FLAWS THAT MIGHT EXIST THAT'S NUMBER ONE IN THE SYSTEM ITSELF. BUT WE HAVE TO BASE IT ON THE FACT OF WHAT WE KNOW IS RIGHT. WHAT IS JUST AND WHAT IS GOOD FOR US. WE HAVE TRIED EVERYTHING THIS STATE TO BECOME HARDER AND HARDER ON CRIMINALS. AND ONLY THINK IT IS DONE IS MADE A HARD HARDER. AND MADE HARD TO CRIMINALS. WE HAVE NOT SOLVED THE PROBLEM YET. WE SAW THAT WITH OUR YOUNG PEOPLE AS WE REDUCE THE NUMBER FROM TEN THOUSAND IN DJJ NOW TO SEVEN HUNDRED BY HAVING A DIFFERENT POLICY AND A PROGRAM TO HELP THEM IN THEIR HOMES AND FAMILIES. SO WE START TALKING ABOUT VOTING I'M JUST AT A QUANDARY AS WHAT DO WE THINK WOULD HAPPEN. IF A PERSON VOTED. IF A PERSON THAT WE DIDN'T LIKE VOTED. AND A LOT OF FOLKS I DON'T LIKE WHO VOTE A LOT OF FOLKS WHO HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THEIR MORALS THAT VOTE. AND YET WE HAVE NOT RESTRICTED THEM BECAUSE WE LIVE IN A COUNTRY THAT WAS FOUNDED ON A FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE. NO TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION ATTACKS PERSON IN THE STATE YOU THEN DESERVE TO DECIDE WHO YOUR REPRESENTATIVE WILL BE THAT IS A FUNDAMENTAL AMERICAN PRINCIPLES THAT I LEARNED IN KINDERGARTEN. NO TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION. AND OUR DESIRE TO BE PUNITIVE TO ATTACK INDIVIDUALS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE PUNISH THEM ENOUGH. HAS NOT PROVEN IN ANY WAY TO MAKE US SAFER TO MAKE THE STATE STRONGER AND HAS MADE OUR BUDGET BASICALLY BLOW UP IN TERMS OF ALL THE THINGS WE'VE DONE THAT HAVE NOT IN ANY WAY HELPED. CLEARLY THERE'S A NEED FOR CHANGE. AND I DON'T THINK ANYONE WALKS AROUND THE STATE WORRYING ABOUT SOMEBODY VOTING. WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN PUT MAY HAVE COMMITTED A CRIME THAT WE DID NOT LIKE. THAT IS GENERALLY NOT THE CONCERN OF BOTH OF US WALKING UP AND DOWN THE STREET EVERY DAY THAT IF THAT PERSON HAVE THE RIGHT TO VOTE THEY WOULD COMMIT MORE CRIMES WHAT KIND OF THINKING IS THIS. THE LOGIC IS JUST NOT BE HERE. AND SO WHEN WE START TALKING ABOUT FOLKS WHO GO ON IAN WHO HAVE EARNED THE RIGHT TO BE PAROLED KEEP THAT IN MIND. THEY'RE JUST NOT TURNED OUT. THERE BURN THE RIGHT FOR PAROLE. AND I APPRECIATE MY COLLEAGUE OVER HERE FROM EAST COUNTY WHO UNDERSTANDS NOW THAT HE'S WORKING WITH THEM THAT THESE FOLKS HAVE SPENT YEARS TRYING TO IMPROVE THEMSELVES AND DEAL WITH THE ISSUES. AND COMING OUT AND GIVING THE RIGHT TO VOTE IS A FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE THAT WE SHOULD BE WILLING TO GIVE TO THEM TO ALLOW THEM TO EXPRESS THEMSELVES AND TO STRENGTHEN THEM AS THEY BECOME. A CITIZENS AGAIN. TO BE FULLY PARTICIPATE IN THIS SO CALLED ENTERPRISE CALL DEMOCRACY. IT IS INTERESTING TO ME THAT WE CONTINUE TO GO TO THE WORST STORIES THAT WE'VE EVER HEARD ABOUT WHO'S A PET A FATHER WHO'S DONE THIS AND- THAT AND ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. AND YET WE STILL ARE HOLDING ON THOSE THINGS IS IF HAVE SAID. STORE THEIR LIVES. WOULD YOU BE SEVEN TIMES AS WE HEARD IN THE BIBLE OF WOULD BE SEVENTY TIMES SEVEN YOU GIVE THEM AS MANY TIMES NECESSARY TO BE THERE TO GROW AND TO DEVELOP AND TO BECOME THE CITIZEN WE WANT THEM TO BE SO THE FACT THAT WE'VE GOT THIS IDEA THAT WE GO TO CREATE THESE PERFECT PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING TO VOTE WHEN OUR NEIGHBORS ARE PERFECT OUR RELATIVES AREN'T PERFECT. OUR MINISTERS AREN'T PERFECT ALL OF THOSE FOLKS WHO WORK IN OUR LIVES ARE IN PERFECT INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE THE RIGHT TO VOTE AND WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE THE RIGHT TO VOTE SO I REALLY RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOU I VOTE ON THIS THAT WE MOVE FORWARD IN CALIFORNIA THAT WE STOP LOOKING BACK STOP DIGGING UP ALL THINGS THAT WE CAN THROW OUT SOME KIND OF THE GREAT EXCITEMENT IN OUR CONSTITUENTS THEY WERE GOING TO OBVIOUSLY HAVE THESE RAPIST RUNNING IN FRONT OF POLLING BOOTHS AND VOTING. THAT THAT HONEST PEOPLE AWAY FROM VOTING I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IMAGE WE HAVE IS WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN. THOUGHT IS THERE WILL POST. AS THEY HAVE EARNED PAROLE. THEY'VE THEIR DESIRE TO BE TO IMPROVE THEMSELVES AND HAVE DEMONSTRATED IN THE THINGS THAT THEY'VE DONE THIRTY THEN BE WILLING TO VOTE AND BE GIVEN THE RIGHT ONCE AGAIN TO BE THOSE CITIZENS THAT WE TALK ABOUT THAT BASICALLY ARE INVOLVED IN THE GOVERNMENT AND VOTING I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOU I VOTE FOR A CA SIX THAT WE GET AWAY FROM THE FEAR TACTICS AND ALL THE DRAMA THAT EXIST AND REALIZE THAT THESE ARE OUR RELATIVES OUR FRIENDS. OUR FAMILIES OUR CHILDREN WHO NEED A SECOND CHANCE THANKS. THANK YOU TO WHOEVER MISTER GIBSON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. RUMORS MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I JUST RISE AS A PROBLEM CO AUTHOR OF ACR SIX AND THANK THE AUTHOR. FROM SACRAMENTO FOR BRINGING THIS A MEASURE FOR IT I WAS OFF THE FLOOR AND ALL THE FLOOR DIDN'T HEAR MUCH OF THEDEBATE. OTHER THAN TO SIMPLY SAY THIS IS THE RIGHT WAY TO GO. DOCTOR WEBER SUMMED IT UP PERFECTLY AND I CAN ADD TO HER ARTICULATION OF THEIRS THIS IS ABOUT GIVING INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE PAID THEIR DEBT TO SOCIETY. UNDERSCORE. THEY JUST GET OUT THEY PAID THEIR DEBT WHATEVER THAT DEBT MAY HAVE BEEN. THEY PAID THEIR DEBT TO SOCIETY THEY HAVE COMPLETED THEIR PRISON SENTENCE. AND WHAT SHOULDN'T WE BE. LOOKING AT TRYING TO RESTORE THAT INDIVIDUAL. TO THEIR FULLNESS TO PARTICIPATE TO INTEGRATE BACK INTO SOCIETY SO THAT HE WON'T A RECIDIVIST BACK INTO A LIFE FROM WHICH THEY CAME FROM. OF GIVING A PERSON OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE TO FEEL GOOD ABOUT ON ONE READING THE PAMPHLET AND ALSO BE ABLE TO MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION. AGAIN THESE ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE PAID THEIR DEBT TO SOCIETY I THINK THIS IS A RIGHT WAY TO GO OTHER STATES HAVE ALREADY TAKEN SUCH ACTION. CALIFORNIA LEADS THE WAY SO WE SHOULD BE LEADING THIS SPACE RIGHT NOW THANK THE AUTHOR SACRAMENTO AND ASK FOR A STRONG AYE VOTE. NAME SISTER GIPSON MISTER MESS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU SPEAKER MEMBERS I APOLOGIZE FOR MY PHONE GOING OFF HERE ON MY DESK SO HOPEFULLY YOU CAN'T HEAR IT BUT I AM GONNA SUPPORT THIS TODAY ACTUALLY SUPPORTED THIS IN COMMITTEE AND I'M GONNA SUPPORTED ON THE FLOOR TODAY AND AS I'VE LISTENED TO SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES GIVE SPEECHES I'VE BEEN. A LITTLE. STUNNED REALLY BY BY SOME OF THE BECAUSE- OUR RHETORIC I THINK HERE IS A LITTLE OVER OVER THE TOP. I'M FACT NOT JUST A LITTLE OVER THE TOP I THINK REALLY. REALLY OVER THE TOP. I DO BELIEVE THAT VOTING. IS INCREDIBLY SPECIAL IT IS WHAT MAKES OUR DEMOCRACY WORK AND WHY DO WE HAVE THIS BILL BEFORE US TODAY IS BECAUSE IN OUR STATE CONSTITUTION. IT SAYS THAT IF YOU ARE ON PAROLE YOU DO NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO VOTE. INTERESTING CALIFORNIA'S ONE OF FIFTY STATES. AND THERE ARE TWO STATES IN THE U. S. THAT ACTUALLY GIVE THE RIGHT TO VOTE IF YOU ARE IN PRISON. IF YOU ARE IN PRISON AND THERE ARE MORE THAN A DOZEN OTHER STATES THAT ALLOW IF YOU'RE ON PAROLE BOTH RED STATES AND BLUE STATES IF YOU'RE ON ON PAROLE. SIMPLY FOR US WHAT WE'RE ASKING. WHAT THE AUTHOR IS ASKING US TO DO TODAY IS THE PLACE. A MEASURE ON THE BALLOT TO ASK THE CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA WHETHER IT'S TIME FOR THAT WORD IS DELETED TO ALLOW THOSE THAT ARE ON PAROLE THE RIGHT THE RIGHT TO VOTE IN COMMITTEE I SAID YOU KNOW I'M NOT SURE HOW I'M GOING TO VOTE ON THIS. WHEN I WHEN I GO TO THE BALLOT BUT I'M GONNA SUPPORT THE QUESTION BEING PLACED ON THE BALLOT I DO THINK THAT WE NEED TO TONE DOWN OUR RHETORIC WE'VE GOT A LITTLE BIT TOO FAR A TODAY WERE ASKING THE VOTERS A CALIFORNIA TO ANSWER A QUESTION THAT'S BEEN TOO LONG TO NOT BE PLACED BEFORE THEM I. RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU WISH MAYES. MISS QUIRK SILVA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. I RISE TODAY TO ALLOW THE VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA TO MAKE A DECISION ON A CA SIX BUT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT AN INDIVIDUAL AND NOT PEOPLE WHERE THEY OR THEM I WANT TO TALK AGAIN ABOUT SOMEONE I KNOW SOMEBODY WHO I LOST THIS YEAR MY BROTHER BILLY AND SOMETIMES A TALK ABOUT BILLY STORY. AND AS SOME OF YOU KNOW HE DIED LESS THAN A YEAR AGO OCTOBER AND HE IS ONE OF THESE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD GONE IN AND OUT OF COUNTY JAIL AND EVEN PRISON. AND WHEN HE WOULD COME OUT. I OFTEN WHAT ASKING WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO. AND HE WOULD TALK ABOUT I WANT TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL. I WANT TO GET A JOB. I WANT TO DO SOMETHING. HE WAS FIFTY ANY SAID I HAVE A LOT OF LIFE TO GIVE I WANT TO DO SOMETHING AND YET SO OFTEN THE BARRIERS THAT CAME IN FRONT OF HIM WHETHER IT WAS GETTING TO A PROBATION APPOINTMENT WHETHER IT WAS HIS ADDICTION WITH ALCOHOL WHETHER IT WAS IT. THE VOICES HE HEARD FROM MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES FROM COMING IN AND OUT OF BEING ON THE STREETS HE DIDN'T MAKE IT BUT HIS HIS STORY IS SO MANY STORIES HERE IT'S THE STORY AS WE SAID OF FAMILIES OF THOSE WHO STRUGGLE AND WHEN WE SEE THOSE WHO STRUGGLE THAT ARE RELEASED. MANY TIMES WE ALL WANT THEM TO IMPROVE AND YET SOME BACK STEP. YOU YEARS AGO I WENT TO CHINO PRISON TO. NOT ONLY THE- LOWER SECURITY BUT THE MAXIMUM SECURITY AND I WALKED THROUGH THOSE GROUNDS AND I WATCHED AND AGAIN THOSE STORIES SOME OF THE PRISON GARDENS TOLD ME DIRECTLY WE HAVE TO DO BETTER BECAUSE THE PEOPLE. COMING OUT OF THESE PRISONS ARE GOING TO BE YOUR NEIGHBORS. SO IT'S UP TO US TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN PREPARE THEM WELL THEY HERE ARE IN PRISON BUT ALSO WHEN THEY ARE RELEASED. TO INTEGRATE BACK INTO SOCIETY IN A WAY THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE AND VOTING IS A WAY THAT ALLOWS THEM TO HAVE SOME TYPE OF HOPE. THE WITHOUT I ASKED HER SUPPORT ON A CA SIX. THANK YOU MISS QUIRK SILVA. MEMBERS SEE NO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THE ACA MISTER MCCARTY YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER YOU KNOW WE SPENT NEARLY AN HOUR TALKING ABOUT AN ISSUE THAT IMPACTS OVER FORTY MILLION CALIFORNIANS. FORTY FIVE FIFTY THOUSAND WHY BECAUSE THIS ISSUE IS SO IMPORTANT TO US DEMOCRACY. AND OUR STATE COMMUNITIES GOES HAND IN HAND AND I WOULD SAY THIS MEASURE ENHANCES BOTH I DO WANT TO JUST BRIEFLY TOUCH ON IT TO ISSUES RAISED. BY THE OPPOSITION IN MY AND MY COLLEAGUES FROM EAST NICHOLAS AND MENIFEE. AND WERE TOUCHED UPON BY. OUR COLLEAGUE BRIEFLY FROM SAN DIEGO ANSWER BUT WHEN IT TO GO BACK ONE MORE TIME. SO THE ISSUE. IS PAROLE I THINK IT'S CRYSTAL CLEAR AS OUR- FRIEND IN OUR FOR FORMER PROSECUTOR FROM LOS ANGELES THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TALKED ABOUT A SUPREME COURT RULED THAT. PAROLE IS NOT EARLY RELEASED YOU ARE RELEASED FROM PRISON AND PAROLE IS THE SUPERVISED RELEASE THROUGHOUT THE PAROLE A DOZEN DEPARTMENT HELP YOU RE INTEGRATE BACK INTO SOCIETY. YOUR SENTENCES OVER. HOWEVER SOMETIMES YOU ARE SENTENCED TO PROBATION. YOU KNOW THEY GET TO DO. THEY GET TO VOTE. SO WE HAD TO SAYS THAT ARE ARBITRARY. THEY REALLY DON'T TAKEN OFFENSE THE REALITY ALSO I WENT TO ADDRESS THE FACT THAT YEAH AND RARE OCCASIONS. AND UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT RE OFFEND. THOSE PEOPLE THEY DON'T GET TO VOTE. THEY DON'T GET TO VOTE THEY'RE GOING BACK TO PRISON SO THEY LOSE THEIR VOTING RIGHTS OF PEOPLE THAT RE OFFEND. DON'T GET TO VOTE. LET'S BE CRYSTAL CLEAR PART ABOUT THAT. DEMOCRACY NEEDS ALL OF US. THE TIME TESTED TRADITION. THIS IS ABOUT CERTAINLY AND I BELIEVE IN I KNOW PEOPLE THEIR SIDE HAVE STRONG OPINIONS THE OTHER WAY BUT WE ALWAYS TALK ABOUT TRUSTING OUR CONSTITUENTS TRUST IN THE VOTERS LET'S GO TO THEM LET'S ASK THEM LET'S NOT THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA THE WAY IN IN TWENTY TWENTY. SB RIVAL THANK YOU. THERE IS MCCARTY AND WITH A COUPLE OF NARAL HOMEOWNERS. DESIRE TO VOTE ALL MEMBERS VOTER DESIRE TO VOTE. THIS TAKES FIFTY FOR ALL MEMBERS VOTER DESIRE TO VOTE THIS TAKES FIFTY FOUR MCCARTY MOVES A CALL IN FILE ORDER FILE ITEM SIXTY EIGHT. IS A C. R. ONE TEN BY MISS WICKS THE CLERK WILL READ ASSEMBLY CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ONE TEN BY SOME REMEMBER WICKS AND OTHERS RELATIVE TO REPRODUCTIVE CARE AND ABORTION SERVICES MISS WICKS YOU'LL THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. DESPITE THE LANDMARK ROE VERSUS WADE DECISION THAT AFFIRMED ACCESS TO SAFE AND LEGAL ABORTION IS A CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED RIGHT. WOMEN'S REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM. IS UNDER ATTACK IN THIS COUNTRY TODAY. JUST THIS YEAR SIXTEEN STATES FILED MOVED OR INACTIVE A SIX WEEK ABORTION BANS WITH MISSOURI AND GEORGIA OPENING THE STATE TO INVESTIGATE AND PROSECUTE MISCARRIAGES. IF THE LAW GOES INTO EFFECT IN GEORGIA WOMEN WHO SEEK ABORTION CARE AFTER SIX WEEKS COULD FACE LIFE IN PRISON OR THE DEATH PENALTY. ALABAMA ENACTED THE MOST EXTREME ANTI ABORTION LEGISLATION IN THE NATION BY MAKING IT A FELONY FOR DOCTOR TO PERFORM AN ABORTION AT ANY TIME DURING A PREGNANCY EVEN IN THE CASE OF RAPE OR INCEST. ARE WE LIVING IN HANDMAID'S TALE. THIS IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND TWENTY NINETEEN. WELL THOSE WHO PUSH THESE ANTI ABORTION LOSS CLAIM TO CARE ABOUT LIFE MANY OF THE STATES THAT HAVE PASSED EXTREME ABORTION BAN LAWS HAVE AMONGST THE HIGHEST MATERNAL AND INFANT MORTALITY RATES IN AMERICA. THEIR ACTIONS FURTHER ENDANGER WOMEN'S HEALTH ESPECIALLY LOW INCOME WOMEN AND WOMEN OF COLOR BECAUSE THEY ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED WHEN LAWS. AND RESTRICTIONS IMPEDE THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CHOICES. FORTUNATELY FOR MORE THAN FIFTY YEARS CALIFORNIA HAS WORKED TO MAKE REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT BY GUARANTEEING THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY. INCLUDING ON ONE TO HAVE OR HAVE NOT AN ABORTION. THE ACCESS TO THE ACCESS TO ABORTION IS THREATEN NATIONALLY CALIFORNIA HAS THE OPPORTUNITY AND THE RESPONSIBILITY TO LEAD BY EXAMPLE FOR STANDING UP FOR ACCESS TO SAFE ABORTIONS. WOMEN AND THEIR FAMILIES ME THE FREEDOM TO MAKE THE BEST DECISION FOR THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES THEY DON'T DESERVE TO PAY THE PRICE FOR A POLITICAL RIGHT WING AGENDA. THIS RESOLUTION IS ABOUT VALUES IT'S A STATEMENT OF VALUES IT'S ABOUT OUR PRINCIPLES BY DECLARING CALIFORNIA REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM STATE FOR ALL ACR ONE TEN WILL REAFFIRM OUR STATE'S COMMITMENT TO GUARANTEEING THE CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED RIGHT TO AN ABORTION. AS A LEGISLATOR AS A WOMAN. AS THE MOTHER OF A LITTLE GIRL. I BELIEVE IT IS OUR TIME RIGHT NOW TO STAND UP FOR WHAT IS RIGHT. AND I KNOW THIS RECESSION MAKES SOME PEOPLE UNCOMFORTABLE. BUT THINK ABOUT THE AND COMFORT OF THE WOMEN LIVING IN PLACES LIKE GEORGIA AND ALABAMA RIGHT NOW. WE CAN BE A BEACON OF HOPE. IN THIS COUNTRY RIGHT NOW I KNOW SOMEONE WHO HAS HAD TO MAKE THAT DECISION. WHO HAD AN ABORTION I THE PLANNED PARENTHOOD CLINIC. IN A SAFE AND SUPPORTIVE ENVIRONMENT THAT WAS MY DECISION TO MAKE AND WE HAVE TO PROTECT THAT WE HAVE TO SEND A MESSAGE TO THE REST REST OF THIS COUNTRY THE CALIFORNIA CAN BE A BEACON OF HOPE AND WE CAN BE. THE REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM STATE FOR ALL. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. AMOS WICKS MISLIM ON YOUR RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS TODAY I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF ACR WHEN TEN EARLIER THIS YEAR WE COMMEMORATED THE FORTY SIXTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT DECISION IN ROE VERSUS WADE. THIS CASE AFFIRMED EVERY WOMAN HAS THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO CONTROL HER OWN REPRODUCTIVE DECISIONS AND WHETHER TO CONTINUE A PREGNANCY OR OBTAIN AN ABORTION. THE ROE VERSUS WADE DECISION ALONG WITH THE CHRIS WILL DECISION OF NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE REMAINS THE CORNERSTONE OF A PERSON'S ABILITY TO CONTROL THEIR REPRODUCTIVE LIVES. BUT CHRIS HOLDEN ROW WERE A VICTORY FOR WOMEN TO THEIR OWN BODIES. TO OWN THEIR OWN BODIES AND LAY THE GROUNDWORK FOR FURTHER REPRODUCTIVE AND SEXUAL HEALTH CARE POLICIES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. IN CALIFORNIA WE ARE ONE OF TWO STATES WHERE THIS RIGHT IS PROTECTED IN OUR STATUTE AND OUR CONSTITUTION. IT HIGHLIGHTS ARE SUPPORT AND COMMITMENT TO PROTECT A PERSON'S FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO DECIDE IF AND WHEN WE BECOME APPARENT. EVEN WITH THESE PROTECTIONS THE RIGHT TO ACCESS ABORTION SAFELY AND LEGALLY IN THIS COUNTRY IS IN JEOPARDY AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND SUPREME COURT CAN STILL NARROW THESE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS. THE PROTECTIONS GRANTED BY ROE VERSUS WADE. ARE AT THEIR HIGHEST RISK OF BEING OVERTURNED. ACCESS TO THE BEST AVAILABLE EVIDENCE BASED HEALTH CARE AND INFORMATION ARE NOW BEING CRIMINALIZED IN OTHER STATES. IT IS VITAL FOR CALIFORNIA WHICH IS HOME TO NEARLY TWENTY MILLION WOMEN TO RECOGNIZE AND CELEBRATE THESE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS ESPECIALLY DURING A TIME WHEN PROVIDERS OF REPRODUCTIVE AND SEXUAL HEALTH CARE ARE UNDER SERIOUS UNRELENTING. ATTACK FOR PROVIDING SAFE AND LEGAL REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE. MEMBERS I LIKE MANY OF YOU STAND IN STRONG SUPPORT A WOMAN'S FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT AS CONFIRMED INNER STATUES AND IN OUR CONSTITUTION TO MAKE HER OWN REPRODUCTIVE DECISIONS AND NOT TO CRIMINALIZE THEM I REGION I VOTE ON ACR ONE TEN. THANK YOU MS AMMAN MS RIVAS YOUR RECORD THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I'M HAPPY TO STAND IN SUPPORT OF ACR WHEN TEN WHICH DECLARES CALIFORNIA'S A REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM STATE FOR ALL. THE LANDMARK DECISION IN ROE V. WADE SOLIDIFIED THAT WOMEN HAVE THE RIGHT TO DECIDE WHAT THEY DO WITH THEIR BODIES CALIFORNIA HAS CONSISTENTLY PROVEN THAT IT WILL PROTECT THIS DECISION AND STAND WITH WOMEN UNFORTUNATELY OTHER STATES DO NOT SHARE OUR VALUES AND WE ARE ONCE AGAIN SEEN AN ATTACK ON WOMEN'S RIGHTS. AS STATES LIKE GEORGIA ALABAMA LOUISIANA AND OTHERS PASS LEGISLATION RESTRICTING A WOMEN'S RIGHT TO GET AN ABORTION WITHOUT THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO REPRODUCTIVE CHOICE WOMEN OR DISADVANTAGE IN EVERY OTHER PART OF THEIR LIVES THIS IS WHY IT'S IMPORTANT THAT CALIFORNIA REAFFIRMS THAT IT STANDS WITH WOMEN AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK. I ON ACR ONE TEN THANK YOU. NAME IS RIVAS MISS KAMLAGER-DOVE. YOUR RECORD. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. SO THIS YEAR MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY BILLS RESTRICTING ABORTION HAVE BEEN FILED IN FORTY ONE STATES. THIS IS TWENTY NINETEEN PEOPLE FORTY SIX YEARS SINCE ROE V. WADE YET WE'RE- STATE POLITICIANS ACROSS THE COUNTRY STILL PUSHING AN AGGRESSIVE ANTI ABORTION AGENDA. THAT SEEKS TO DO ONE THING TO BAN ABORTION OUT RIGHT. OPPOSED ROE FUTURE IS NEARING AT A VERY RAPID PACE. WITHOUT POLICIES THAT PROTECT AND EXPAND ACCESS TWENTY FIVE MILLION WOMEN OF REPRODUCTIVE AGE COULD LOSE ACCESS TO ABORTION IF ROE IS OVERTURNED OR SEVERELY RESTRICTED. I'LL SAY THAT AGAIN TWENTY FIVE MILLION WOMEN I AM SURE THAT WE KNOW SOME OF THOSE TWENTY FIVE MILLION WOMEN WE MAY BE SOME OF THOSE TWENTY FIVE MILLION WOMEN. I AM PROUD TO SERVE ON THE PLANNED PARENTHOOD LOS ANGELES BOARD AND PROUD TO SERVE IN CALIFORNIA WHERE WE CONSISTENTLY TAKES STEPS TO EXPAND NOT TO BAN. ACCESS TO ESSENTIAL HEALTH CARE. WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY AND AN OBLIGATION TO ENSURE THAT ALL PATIENTS STILL ACCESS HEALTH CARE NO MATTER WHAT. ACR ONE TEN CLARIFIES THAT CALIFORNIA IS NOT STEPPING BACK WHEN REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE AN ACCESS IS UNDER GRAVE THREAT BUT THAT WE'RE STEPPING UP TO REAFFIRM OUR COMMITMENT TO GUARANTEE THE RIGHT TO ABORTION FOR WOMEN AND PREGNANT INDIVIDUALS. BECAUSE ABORTION IS HEALTH CARE AND HEALTH CARE IS A HUMAN RIGHT. I WANT TO ALSO ADD. THAT YOU KNOW WE THINK THAT IF YOU BAN IT THAT PEOPLE WON'T HAVE IT. THAT'S NOT TRUE HISTORY HAS SHOWN THAT THAT'S NOT TRUE. DO YOU WANT TO HAVE SAFE ACCESSIBLE ACCESS. DO YOU WANT TO HAVE DANGEROUS RISKY FATAL ABORTIONS HAPPENING TO SOME OF THOSE TWENTY FIVE MILLION WOMEN THAT WE KNOW THAT WE MAY BE. I SAID IT BEFORE. I AM A WOMAN. LET ME MAKE MY OWN DECISIONS ABOUT MY HEALTH CARE GOVERNMENT STAY OUT OF MY **** I URGE A YES ON A C. R. ONE TEN. THANK YOU IS KAMLAGER-DOVE MR GLORIA. MISS GLORIA RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ONE TEN DECLARING CALIFORNIA AS A REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM THE STATE FOR ALL. YEAH AS A GAY MAN I UNDERSTAND THE DIFFICULT JOURNEY TO A QUALITY IN EVERY SENSE OF THE WORD CAN BE VERY DIFFICULT. NOTHING NOTHING IN OUR HISTORIC STRUGGLE AS LGBT Q. AMERICANS SEEMS TO COMPARE WHEN IT COMES TO THE RIGHTS OF WOMEN. AND THEIR ONGOING EFFORTS TO TRY CONTROL WHAT HAPPENS WITH THEIR OWN BODIES IN WITH THEIR OWN HEALTHCARE. IT'S INCREDIBLE TO ME THEY WERE STILL HAVING THIS CONVERSATION IN TWENTY NINETEEN IN FACT IT'S TRULY UNBELIEVABLE BUT YET HERE WE ARE. WHAT'S WORSE I'M MORE CONVERSATION ACCESS TO REPRODUCTIVE CARE. IN LIGHT OF THE REPEATED ATTACKS ON A WOMAN'S BODY BY EMILY MOSTLY MALE POLITICIANS. YOUR CALL THE COMMEMORATION OF OUR FORTY SIXTH ANNIVERSARY OF ROE V. WADE EARLY THIS YEAR. I DISCUSSED THE LINE OF QUESTIONING BY UNITED STATES SENATOR COMMA HARRIS NOW JUDICIAL CONFIRMATION HEARING SHE ASKED. THINK OF ANY LAWS THAT GIVE THE GOVERNMENT THE POWER. TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT A MALE BODY. THE RESPONSE AS MANY OF YOU MAY RECALL. I'M NOT THINKING OF ANY RIGHT NOW. SOME OF MY HETEROSEXUAL PEERS MAY BE ABLE TO DONATE BLOOD I STILL CáC THàNH. I CAN STILL UNEQUIVOCALLY BECAUSE I'M A MAN CHOOSE TO TAKE CARE OF MY HEALTH IN ANY WAY THAT I WISH AT ANY PHASE OF MY LIFE. AND I BILL I'M ABLE TO MAINTAIN THAT INDEPENDENT A SCISSION MAKING SIMPLY BECAUSE OF MY SEX. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE SAFEGUARD THE ABILITIES OF THE RIGHTS UNDER ROE V. WADE THOSE WITH THOSE ARE PROVIDED TO WOMEN BECAUSE THEY ARE FUNDAMENTAL TO REPRODUCTIVE CARE. AND THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR LGBT Q. CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE ABLE TO CONCEDE. RESEARCH HAS IDENTIFIED HIGHER SEXUAL ACTIVITY RATES AND I'M RATES OF PREGNANCY AMONG LGBT Q. U. AS COMPARED TO THEIR HETEROSEXUAL PEERS. AND WHILE WILL BE MADE MADE ONLY HAD CISGENDER WOMEN IN MIND WHEN IT WAS DECIDED OVER FIFTY YEARS FIFTY YEARS AGO. THAT COURT DECISIONS AT THE RIGHT PRICE IN FOR IT ABBOTT SEEN RIGHTS OF SOME OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE TRANSGENDER POPULATIONS IN OUR LGBT Q. COMMUNITY. I CAN GO ON BUT IT'S NOTNECESSARY BUT SHOULD BE A NO BRAINER MY COLLEAGUES I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR ACR ONE TEN. THERE WAS GLORIA MS PARA QUE YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS TODAY I RISE IS THE CHAIR OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON WOMEN'S REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH. IN SUPPORT OF ACR ONE TEN. IF YOU'VE HEARD FROM MY COLLEAGUES ALREADY TODAY ACCESS TO COMPREHENSIVE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE IS UNDER ATTACK ACROSS THE NATION. THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IN WASHINGTON HAS WAGED A WAR ON WOMEN'S RIGHT TO REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM. AND AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES SAID THESE ARE OUR BODIES AND WE SHOULD HAVE A RIGHT TO CONTROL. MINISTRATIONS USE OF THE GAG RULE ON TITLE TEN FUNDING IS THE MOST RECENT EFFORTS TO UNDERMINE WOMEN'S RIGHT TO ACCESS COMPREHENSIVE. HIGH QUALITY AND AFFORDABLE BIRTH CONTROL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES. BUT THIS DISPROPORTIONATELY TARGETS LOWER INCOME INDIVIDUALS AND WOMEN OF COLOR RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA WHO WILL LOSE ACCESS TO THE COMPREHENSIVE CARE THAT PREVENTS THEM. FROM GETTING CANCER AND OTHER DIRE CONSEQUENCES. HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE UNDERSTAND ABORTION IS HEALTH CARE AND ACCESS TO IT IS A HUMAN RIGHT. WE HAS A STAKE IN IN YOU TO MAKE STRIDES TO DELIVER EXPAND AND INVEST IN SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE INCLUDING SAFE ACCESS TO ABORTION CARE. INCLUDING THE INVESTMENT OF A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE THIS BODY AND OUR STATE TO PUT INTO THE BUDGET. WELL THE NATIONAL ATTACK ON WOMEN'S RIGHT TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH IS AT THE FOREFRONT OF OUR MINDS WE MUST ALSO REMEMBER IT IS NOT THE ONLY PROBLEM THAT WE FACE IN THE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE SPACE. CALIFORNIA PENSIONS AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS ARE FACING THE CONSEQUENCES WELL. ADEQUATE STAFFING FUNDING ACCESSIBILITY ESPECIALLY IN CALIFORNIA'S RURAL COMMUNITIES AND IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES. I SOARING STI EPIDEMIC. PATIENT SAFETY. CONSUMER FRAUD AND AN UNACCEPTABLE MATERNAL MORTALITY RATE FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN. ARE JUST SOME OF THE FEW ISSUES AND BARRIERS THE CALIFORNIANS STILL FACE IN THE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE SPACE. IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY AND AN OBLIGATION TO FIGHT TO ENSURE THAT PATIENTS AND EVERYONE IN THIS COUNTRY CAN STILL ACCESS HEALTH CARE NO MATTER THEIR ZIP CODE. THEIR GENDER OR THEIR COLOR. TODAY WE STAND TOGETHER TO SPEAK TO THE IMPORTANCE OF REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE FOR ALL AMERICANS AND ALL CALIFORNIANS I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR SUPPORT ON ACR ONE TEN. THANK YOU THEY HAVE AS FAR HAND. MISS GALLAGHER YOUR RECOGNIZE. MEMBERS SHOULD BE LIKE TO BE RECOGNIZED PLEASE RAISE YOUR MICROPHONE SO I COULD SEE THEM. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS. I RISE IS THE FATHER OF TWO DAUGHTERS. WHO I WANT TO HAVE EVERY OPPORTUNITY IN WHO I DON'T WANT EVER TO BE DENIED THEIR RIGHTS. FOR FAR TOO LONG WE KNOW IN THIS COUNTRY THAT. THE WOMEN'S RIGHTS. TO SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS WERE VIOLATED WERE PUT IN SECOND PLACE. AND. THAT IS OBVIOUSLY A LARGE MOTIVATOR BEHIND A LOT OF I THINK THIS DISCUSSION THAT WE'VE EARD TODAY. BUT I. I ALSO RISE AS THE FATHER OF TWIN BOYS. WHO CAME AT THIRTY WEEKS. TEN WEEKS BEFORE THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO COME INTO THE WORLD. I WAS WITH MY WIFE. IN UCSF. WHEN THOSE TWIN BOYS WERE SIXTEEN WEEKS ALONG. AND THEY DID AN ECHO CARDIOGRAM TO CHECK ON THEIR HEART BEATS. AND TO SEE THEIR BLOOD FLOW. AND IF THINGS WERE NOT GOING RIGHT THEY WERE PREPARED TO DO SURGERY. ON THOSE TO UNBORN CHILDREN AND NOBODY IS EVER GOING TO TELL ME THAT THEY ARE NOT PEOPLE. THEY'RE NOT. THEY WEREN'T PERSONS AT THAT POINT IN TIME YOU DON'T DO SURGERY ON INANIMATE OBJECTS. SO THIS IS VERY REAL FOR ME. AS WELL AND THIS IS WHAT WE TRY TO OVER SIMPLIFY THIS ISSUE AND IT'S REALLY JUST NOT THAT SIMPLE. AND THAT IS WHAT THAT IS ACTUALLY THE STRUGGLE THAT IS GOING ON ACROSS THIS NATION. IT'S A STRUGGLE THAT WAS UNRESOLVED IN ROW I MEAN IF YOU READ THE DECISION. YOU WILL SEE THAT WHILE RECOGNIZING THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY. FOR WOMEN AND TO MAKE A CHOICE ABOUT THEIR REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH IT ALSO RECOGNIZED THAT STATES DO HAVE A LEGITIMATE INTEREST. WHEN A FETUS BECOMES VIABLE WHEN WE'RE DEALING WITH A CHILD. AND SO THAT. IN RECENT YEARS HAS BECOME A BIG DEBATE BECAUSE WE SEE THAT. WE DO HAVE TO WE DO HAVE A PERSON ANOTHER PERSON. IT'S RIGHTS THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH HERE. IT ISN'T SIMPLY. JUST A WOMEN'S RIGHTS ISSUE IT IS ALSO. THE RIGHTS OF THIS I'M OF UNBORN CHILDREN. AND SO STATES ARE WRESTLING WITH THIS QUESTION WHAT IS THE MORAL RIGHT THING TO DO. HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT THOSE RIGHTS. ARE PROTECTED AS WELL. AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT THIS STATE. ULTIMATELY HAVE TO WRESTLE WITH. AS WELL. AND I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE MORE ROBUST CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS LESS US VERSUS THEM CONVERSATIONS AND MORE REALLY TRYING TO GET DOWN. TO THE HEART OF ISSUES. AND TRY TO ENSURE THAT THERE ARE RIGHTS DUE PROCESS. MANY QUALITY FOR ALL. AND IT'S NOT GOING TO BE JUST A SIMPLE. ONE WHERE THE OTHER DISCUSSION. AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SEEING AND I JUST I BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO HAVE MORE OF A DISCUSSION ABOUT. THOSE RIGHT SOME OF THE MOST ARDENT. ADVOCATES PRO LIFE ADVOCATES IN THIS DEBATE RIGHT NOW ARE WOMEN SO WHEN I HEAR THAT IS JUST MEN MAKING DECISIONS THAT'S COMPLETELY WRONG IN AN ACCURATE. WHILE A ROSE IS ONE OF THE MOST ACTIVE ARTNET VOICES A WOMAN AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL TALKING ABOUT THIS VERY THING. SO I WOULD VENTURE TO SAY THOSE TWENTY FIVE MILLION WOMEN HAVE DIFFERENT OPINIONS. AND I THINK WE SHOULD RESPECT THOSE OPINIONS AND WE SHOULD HAVE. AGAIN. A MORE IN DEPTH THE ROBUST DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT IT'S NOT. THAT SIMPLE. THANK YOU MEMBERS. MR MATHIS HERE RECOGNIZE YES MISS YOUR QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR. WITHOUT OBJECTION SO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE WE SUPPORT A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE BUT NOT PARENT RIGHTS.
