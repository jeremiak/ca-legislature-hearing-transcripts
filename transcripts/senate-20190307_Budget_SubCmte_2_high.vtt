VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES --

00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:58.918
UNDERSTANDING OF COURSE THE

00:06:58.985 --> 00:07:01.521
DEVASTATION AND TRAGEDY OF THE

00:07:01.587 --> 00:07:03.890
CAMPFIRE AND THE IMPACT ON THE

00:07:03.956 --> 00:07:05.258
TOWN OF PARADISE.

00:07:05.324 --> 00:07:07.293
SHIFTING GEARS A BUT STILL HONOR

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.028

MODERNIZING OUR WATER

I THINK THE AGENCY IS

00:07:35.655 --> 00:07:36.689
STRENGTHENING THE CONNECTIONS

00:07:36.756 --> 00:07:37.924

NATURAL RESOURCES --

00:07:39.625 --> 00:07:40.993
SO GOOD EXAMPLE OF THAT IS

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:44.163
EXPANDING ACCESS TO OUR PARKS --

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:45.865

SIGNIFICANT ACCESS TO PARKS --

00:07:51.971 --> 00:07:53.172
AND THEN LASTLY IS JUST

00:07:53.239 --> 00:07:54.674
RECRUITING AND AND MAINTAINING A

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:56.709

A LITTLE BIT OF TENSION BETWEEN --

THIS FOR SO THAT WE DON'T.

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:35.808
FOR IN THE OUT YEARS BUT THERE'S

00:09:35.875 --> 00:09:37.176
A TENSION THAT SAYS WELL IF WE

00:09:37.243 --> 00:09:39.045

00:14:29.969 --> 00:14:30.970
INCREASING THE COMMERCIAL

00:14:31.036 --> 00:14:33.138

THAT THAT'S A THAT'S A

00:14:36.642 --> 00:14:38.777
POSSIBILITY BUT WE WE CANNOT

00:14:38.844 --> 00:14:40.379
THINK OF ALL T. --

00:14:40.446 --> 00:14:42.147
THE SERVICES THAT ARE IN THESE

00:14:42.214 --> 00:14:44.817
AREAS SOMETIMES THEY CAN'T PAY

00:14:44.883 --> 00:14:46.952
FOR THE WELL THE NEED THAT THEY

00:14:47.019 --> 00:14:48.754
HAVE YEAH.

00:14:48.821 --> 00:14:50.489
I MEAN THE NOW TO RESOURCES

00:14:50.556 --> 00:14:52.958
AGENCY STEWARDS IT'S FOR THE

00:14:53.025 --> 00:14:54.860
STATE SO YOU THINK ABOUT THE

OR PROPERTY OR FACILITIES ACROSS

00:15:03.802 --> 00:15:05.904
THE STATE. ONE OF THE CHALLENGES

00:15:05.971 --> 00:15:08.440
WE HAVE FRANKLY IS I ENSURING

00:15:08.507 --> 00:15:10.776
THAT WE HAVE FUNDS TO OPERATE

00:15:10.843 --> 00:15:12.211
AND MAINTAIN THOSE ASSETS.

00:15:12.278 --> 00:15:13.979
OUR STATE VOTERS HAVE BEEN VERY

00:15:14.046 --> 00:15:16.515
GENEROUS IN APPROVING GENERAL

00:15:16.582 --> 00:15:18.183
OBLIGATION BONDS --

00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:20.019
AGAIN MOST RECENTLY LAST JUNE

00:15:20.085 --> 00:15:21.420
PROP --

00:15:21.487 --> 00:15:22.855
SIXTY EIGHT AND AND THOSE BOND

00:15:22.921 --> 00:15:24.323
PROVIDE CRITICAL CAPITAL FUNDING

00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:25.658
BY THE CAPITAL FUNDING IS ONE

00:15:25.724 --> 00:15:27.159
TIME IN NATURE --

00:15:27.226 --> 00:15:28.527
INTO ONE AREA OF FOCUS A

00:15:28.594 --> 00:15:30.229
PRIORITY WE HAVE IS HOW DO WE

00:15:30.296 --> 00:15:32.464
ENSURE THAT WE CAN OPERATE AND

00:15:32.531 --> 00:15:34.199
MAINTAIN THOSE --

00:15:34.266 --> 00:15:35.401
THOSE FACILITIES THAT WERE

00:15:35.467 --> 00:15:36.635
INVESTING IN --

00:15:36.702 --> 00:15:37.703
SO I THINK IT'S A CHALLENGE

00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:39.338
MOVING FORWARD AND ONE THAT WE

00:15:39.405 --> 00:15:40.806

YOU KNOW PART OF ACCESSIBILITY

00:19:58.330 --> 00:19:59.598
IS AFFORDABILITY.

00:19:59.665 --> 00:20:01.800
AND TO YOUR POINT IF IT IS ON

00:20:01.867 --> 00:20:04.269
AFFORDABLE ARE FOR MEMBERS OF

00:20:04.336 --> 00:20:05.938
THE COMMUNITY TO ACTUALLY ACCESS

00:20:06.004 --> 00:20:07.806
OUR STATE PARKS THAT'S THAT THE

00:20:07.873 --> 00:20:09.908
CHALLENGE NOT THE PROBLEM --

00:20:09.975 --> 00:20:11.810
STATE PARKS HAS COME A LONG WAY

00:20:11.877 --> 00:20:13.679
OUR TOWARDS.

00:20:13.745 --> 00:20:15.347
AB STRENGTHENING ITS BUDGET AND

00:20:15.414 --> 00:20:16.582
THAT HAS MEANT THAT THERE ARE A

00:20:16.648 --> 00:20:17.816
LOT OF DIFFERENT REVENUE IDEAS

00:20:17.883 --> 00:20:19.851
ON THE TABLE BUT I HEAR YOU LOUD

00:20:19.918 --> 00:20:21.353
AND CLEAR THAT.

00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:22.854
AT SOME POINT --

00:20:22.921 --> 00:20:26.425
THE NEED TO GENERATE REVENUE HAS

00:20:26.491 --> 00:20:28.393
TO BE BALANCED WITH THE ARE.

00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:29.695
IMPERATIVE TO KEEP PARKS

00:20:29.761 --> 00:20:30.929
AFFORDABLE.

00:20:30.996 --> 00:20:33.332
AND I THINK THAT.

00:20:33.398 --> 00:20:36.034
pSHOULD BE THE MOST POPULAR

00:20:36.101 --> 00:20:38.103
DEPARTMENT WITHIN --

00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:38.670
ALL DEPARTMENTS HERE IN THE

00:20:38.737 --> 00:20:39.838
STATE.

00:20:39.905 --> 00:20:41.607
AND THAT THERE IS A GREATER

00:20:41.673 --> 00:20:43.775
VALUE THAN JUST THE BOTTOM LINE

00:20:43.842 --> 00:20:44.943
WHEN IT COMES TO STATE PARKS I

00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:46.612
ALSO LOOK AT IT IS ESPECIALLY IN

00:20:46.678 --> 00:20:47.579
MY NECK OF THE WOODS.

00:20:47.646 --> 00:20:48.780
SOME OF THE MOST IMPOVERISHED

00:20:48.847 --> 00:20:49.815
COMMUNITIES IN THE STATE THEY'RE

00:20:49.881 --> 00:20:51.516
HUGE ECONOMIC DRIVERS FOR

00:20:51.583 --> 00:20:52.684
COMMUNITIES AND WE ALSO NEED

00:20:52.751 --> 00:20:53.785
TAKE THAT ACCOUNT.

00:20:53.852 --> 00:20:54.920

LOOK A LOT OF US HERE FIND TO BE

00:21:26.818 --> 00:21:28.553
CENTRAL BADLANDS HAVING GONE

00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:29.655
THROUGH.

00:21:29.721 --> 00:21:31.289
THE CATASTROPHES WE'VE BEEN

00:21:33.859 --> 00:21:35.360
CENTRAL FOCUS.

WE'RE GONNA HAVE A SEPARATE

00:21:36.194 --> 00:21:38.030
HEARINGS ON WITH CAL FIRE IN

00:21:38.096 --> 00:21:39.364

RIGHT NOW THE FORTY FIVE AIRPORT

00:21:46.805 --> 00:21:48.206
JUST DROP I THINK THAT'S A

00:21:48.273 --> 00:21:49.675
POSITIVE STEP.

00:21:49.741 --> 00:21:53.679
TO JUST GET MOVING --

00:21:53.745 --> 00:21:55.714
I I DID WANT TO SORT OF RAISE

00:21:55.781 --> 00:21:58.684
THIS ISSUE AROUND --

00:21:58.750 --> 00:22:00.552
NOT S. R. AREAS RIGHT AND THAT

00:22:00.619 --> 00:22:02.788
THE COMPLEXITIES THAT WE HAVE IT

00:22:02.854 --> 00:22:03.422
JUST TO GET YOUR GENERAL TAKE ON

00:22:03.488 --> 00:22:05.724
SORT OF THE CHALLENGE FROM THE

00:22:05.791 --> 00:22:06.491
GOVERNMENT'S PERSPECTIVE WE

00:22:06.558 --> 00:22:09.294
MIGHT HAVE OF WE'RE GONNA PUT.

00:22:09.361 --> 00:22:10.762
CERTAIN FUNDS ASIDE TO GO TAKE

00:22:10.829 --> 00:22:12.597
ON FUEL REDUCTION AND OTHER SORT

00:22:12.664 --> 00:22:15.300
OF BROAD RESOURCES RESILIENCY

00:22:15.367 --> 00:22:16.268
PROJECTS.

00:22:16.334 --> 00:22:17.669
BUT HOW HOW DO YOU SEE THAT

00:22:17.736 --> 00:22:19.304
PARTNERSHIP WORKING WITH SAY

00:22:19.371 --> 00:22:22.741
COUNTIES MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENTS --

00:22:22.808 --> 00:22:24.242
OTHER THAT YOU KNOW COULD GO

00:22:24.309 --> 00:22:25.711
CONSERVANCY'S TO OTHERS ARE

00:22:25.777 --> 00:22:27.245
LOCAL PARTNERS HOW DO YOU LOOK

00:22:27.312 --> 00:22:28.780
AT THAT RELATIONSHIP WHEN YOU'RE

00:22:28.847 --> 00:22:30.749
SORT OF STRATEGICALLY ASSESSING.

00:22:30.816 --> 00:22:31.616
THE BUDGET IN THIS RESILIENCE

00:22:31.683 --> 00:22:33.118
HERE WHILE THOSE RELATIONSHIPS

00:22:33.185 --> 00:22:33.985
IN THOSE PARTNERSHIPS ARE

00:22:34.052 --> 00:22:35.253
ESSENTIAL SO --

00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:36.988
DURING THE BROWN ADMINISTRATION --

00:22:37.055 --> 00:22:38.190
I HELP TO STAND UP THE TREE

00:22:38.256 --> 00:22:39.991
MORTALITY TASK FORCE AND IF YOU

00:22:40.058 --> 00:22:41.827
RECALL A FEW YEARS AGO.

00:22:41.893 --> 00:22:42.394
I WAS REALLY WE STARTED TO

00:22:42.461 --> 00:22:46.665
UNDERSTAND THIS EPIDEMIC OF ART.

00:22:46.732 --> 00:22:47.466
DYING TREES ACROSS THE SIERRA

00:22:47.532 --> 00:22:50.035
AND LITERALLY TREES WERE FALLING --

00:22:50.102 --> 00:22:51.870
IN THE IN THE ROADS AND ON

00:22:51.937 --> 00:22:53.205
BUILDINGS ACROSS THE SIERRA

00:22:53.271 --> 00:22:54.272
NEVADA.

00:22:54.339 --> 00:22:55.707
WE QUICKLY REALIZED ENDING UP

00:22:55.774 --> 00:22:57.175
THAT TASK FORCE.

00:22:57.242 --> 00:22:58.610
IS LOCAL PARTICIPATION WAS

00:22:58.677 --> 00:22:59.678
ESSENTIAL.

00:22:59.745 --> 00:23:00.912
BECAUSE THESE LOCAL LEADERS IN

00:23:00.979 --> 00:23:02.514
THEIR AGENCIES ACTUALLY

00:23:02.581 --> 00:23:03.281
UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING ON

00:23:03.348 --> 00:23:04.549
THE GROUND THEY CAN DEPLOY

00:23:04.616 --> 00:23:06.585
RESOURCES MORE QUICKLY AND

00:23:06.651 --> 00:23:07.152
FRANKLY MORE EFFICIENTLY AND

00:23:07.219 --> 00:23:08.053
EFFECTIVELY.

00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:09.154
SOMETIMES IN STATE GOVERNMENT --

00:23:09.221 --> 00:23:11.723
CAN THING THAT I'M REALLY

00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:13.091
EXCITED TO ANNOUNCE THAT THE

00:23:13.158 --> 00:23:14.826
GOVERNOR EARLIER THIS WEEK --

00:23:14.893 --> 00:23:16.428
APPOINTED A NEW DIRECTOR OF HIS

00:23:16.495 --> 00:23:17.963
GOVERNOR'S A FORCE MANAGEMENT

00:23:18.029 --> 00:23:19.297
TASK FORCE A WOMAN NAMED

00:23:19.364 --> 00:23:20.799
JENNIFER MONTGOMERY WHO'S BEEN A

00:23:20.866 --> 00:23:22.167
PLASTER COUNTY SUPERVISOR FOR

00:23:22.234 --> 00:23:23.702
THELAST TEN YEARS.

00:23:23.769 --> 00:23:25.403
WHO HAS BEEN LIVING AND WORKING

00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:26.471
ON THIS ISSUE --

00:23:26.538 --> 00:23:28.440
IN HER COMMUNITY I AND I THINK

00:23:28.507 --> 00:23:29.574
THAT APPOINTMENT WAS MADE IN

00:23:29.641 --> 00:23:31.910
PART RECOGNIZING THAT THE

00:23:31.977 --> 00:23:34.880
CRITICAL IMPORTANCE OF BRINGING --

00:23:34.946 --> 00:23:36.348
LOCAL TO THE TABLE ESSENTIAL

00:23:36.414 --> 00:23:37.482
PARTNERS --

00:23:37.549 --> 00:23:39.951
AND NOT AS SUBSIDIARIES ABOUT

00:23:40.018 --> 00:23:42.287
TRULY CENTRAL PARTNER SO I THINK

00:23:42.354 --> 00:23:43.588
IT'S ESSENTIAL MOVING FORWARD IN

00:23:43.655 --> 00:23:44.823
THE WE WE WANT THEM TO PARTNERS

00:23:44.890 --> 00:23:46.491
TO YOU I MEAN MY MY CONCERN IS

00:23:46.558 --> 00:23:48.560
IF IF. ONE PARTICULAR LOCALITY

00:23:48.627 --> 00:23:50.028
DRAG THEIR HEELS DOESN'T WANT TO

SPEND FUNDS WE'RE GOING IN THE

00:23:51.797 --> 00:23:53.231
STATE RESPONSIBILITY AREAS DO IN

00:23:53.298 --> 00:23:53.665
OUR WORK.

00:23:53.732 --> 00:23:54.966
AND THEN YOU KNOW MAYBE WERE

00:23:55.033 --> 00:23:56.468
CONTRACTING WITH THEM BUT THAT'S

00:23:56.535 --> 00:23:58.136
NOT OCCURRING I JUST WONDER HOW

00:23:58.203 --> 00:24:00.205
TO BUILD EITHER MORE INCENTIVES

00:24:00.272 --> 00:24:03.441
FOR YOU KNOW MORE ACCOUNTABILITY

00:24:03.508 --> 00:24:05.477
FRANKLY TO MAKE SURE THAT.

00:24:05.544 --> 00:24:07.045
THIS RESILIENCY HAVE PUSHES

00:24:07.112 --> 00:24:09.381
BEINGS ARE UNIFIED ACROSS ALL

00:24:09.447 --> 00:24:09.981

TO SEEMS LIKE A CRITICAL PIECE

00:24:14.286 --> 00:24:15.320
BECAUSE EVEN GOING THROUGH CAL

00:24:15.387 --> 00:24:17.189
FIRES PRIOR TO MAPS RIGHT LIKE

00:24:17.255 --> 00:24:19.524
THERE'S THE FIRE ZONES ARE IT'S

00:24:19.591 --> 00:24:21.059
PATCHWORK YEAH AND GETTING

00:24:21.126 --> 00:24:22.294

PATCHWORK YEAH I MEAN I THINK

00:24:23.662 --> 00:24:24.663
YOU RAISE AN IMPORTANT POINT IN

00:24:24.729 --> 00:24:26.431
IT'S COMPLICATED AND AND I THINK

00:24:26.498 --> 00:24:26.765
THAT.

00:24:26.832 --> 00:24:28.166
THE YOU KNOW WHERE WE UNPACK

00:24:28.233 --> 00:24:30.202
SOME OF THE COMPLEXITY IS ON

00:24:30.268 --> 00:24:31.570
THAT TASK FORCE SO I LOOK

00:24:31.636 --> 00:24:32.170
FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU

00:24:32.237 --> 00:24:33.438
DIRECTLY. EIGHT ONE OTHER

00:24:33.505 --> 00:24:35.073
QUESTION IF YOU DON'T MIND LET

00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:36.041
ME FOLLOW UP ON THE INJURY

00:24:36.107 --> 00:24:37.576
BECAUSE YOU KNOW THERE ARE SOME

00:24:37.642 --> 00:24:38.944
WHO WOULD ARGUE THAT BY

00:24:39.010 --> 00:24:41.546
SUSPENDING THE HUNDRED AND FIFTY

00:24:41.613 --> 00:24:42.414
DOLLAR FEE.

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:44.082
THE PEOPLE BELOW LOCAL FOLKS

00:24:44.149 --> 00:24:45.617
DON'T HAVE ANY SKIN IN THE GAME

00:24:45.684 --> 00:24:48.119
ANYMORE WE'RE BACK FEELING

00:24:48.186 --> 00:24:49.054
EIGHTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS

00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:51.323
THERE'S A VARIETY REQUEST HERE

00:24:51.389 --> 00:24:53.792
THAT ON IT JUST IN THE FIRE

00:24:53.859 --> 00:24:56.962
COMING FORGET IF WE WE HAVE A

00:24:57.028 --> 00:24:57.529
CAP AND TRADE.

00:24:57.596 --> 00:24:59.164
THAT THAT'S AN ARGUMENT THAT

00:24:59.231 --> 00:25:01.166
SAYING THIS IS A BIGGER PROBLEM

00:25:01.233 --> 00:25:03.602
THAN WE ANTICIPATED AND IT WAS A

00:25:03.668 --> 00:25:06.872
EXPEDIENCY THAT WAS YOU KNOW --

00:25:06.938 --> 00:25:08.607
WE'D WE DID THAT WHAT ARE YOUR

00:25:08.673 --> 00:25:10.709
THOUGHTS ON WELL I WILL WAX

00:25:10.775 --> 00:25:12.577
CAREFULLY --

00:25:12.644 --> 00:25:14.579
YET AGAIN ON THIS --

00:25:14.646 --> 00:25:15.080
YEAH THAT WAS OBVIOUSLY

00:25:15.146 --> 00:25:15.714
IMPORTANT --

00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:16.948
YOU KNOW POLICY DISCUSSION ON

00:25:17.015 --> 00:25:18.617
THE ONE HAND THERE WAS A REVENUE

00:25:18.683 --> 00:25:19.918
STREAM THAT COULD.

00:25:19.985 --> 00:25:21.653
THAT COULD GENERATE RESOURCES

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:23.488
FOR CAL FIRE IN THOSE AREAS

00:25:23.555 --> 00:25:25.323
WHERE IT IS WORKING BUT THEY'RE

00:25:25.390 --> 00:25:26.958
ALSO REAL AFFORDABILITY CONCERNS

00:25:27.025 --> 00:25:28.593
IN THOSE RURAL COMMUNITIES.

00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:29.928
AND WE SOMETIMES WHEN YOU THINK

00:25:29.995 --> 00:25:31.129
ABOUT DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES

00:25:31.196 --> 00:25:32.063
IN THE STATE WE THINK ABOUT

00:25:32.130 --> 00:25:33.899
URBAN COMMUNITIES BUT ACTUALLY A

00:25:33.965 --> 00:25:36.368
LOT OF THESE SMALLER --

00:25:36.434 --> 00:25:38.536
COMMUNITIES IN THAT WILD LAND

00:25:38.603 --> 00:25:40.171
URBAN INTERFACE UP TO GO IN THE

00:25:40.238 --> 00:25:41.506
MOUNTAINS ARE DISADVANTAGED --

00:25:41.573 --> 00:25:42.974
SO AGAIN IT'S HIS BALANCE

00:25:43.041 --> 00:25:44.309
QUESTION MAYBE NOT A SATISFYING

00:25:44.376 --> 00:25:45.644
ANSWER FOR YOU BUT WE HAVE TO BE

00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:47.279
ABLE TO BALANCE THE NEED TO

00:25:47.345 --> 00:25:48.980
GENERATE RESOURCES FOR CAL FIRE.

00:25:49.047 --> 00:25:50.515
AND THEN AVOIDING.

00:25:50.582 --> 00:25:52.183
DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT AND

00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:54.753
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES I GO

00:25:54.819 --> 00:25:56.821
BACK TO THE THEME OF HAVING SOME

00:25:56.888 --> 00:25:58.323
SKIN IN THE GAME WHO HAD --

00:25:58.390 --> 00:26:00.225
AND IN WE'RE IN A NEW DIMENSION

00:26:00.292 --> 00:26:02.294
RIGHT NOW ABOUT WE'RE RETHINKING

00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:04.095
THINGS THAT WE THOUGHT ABOUT.

00:26:04.162 --> 00:26:05.263
FIVE YEARS AGO WAS GIVEN THE

00:26:05.330 --> 00:26:06.798
CATASTROPHES THAT WE HAVE WE

00:26:06.865 --> 00:26:08.366
HAVE TO GO BACK AND LOOK AT IT

00:26:08.433 --> 00:26:09.067
SENATOR I'M SORRY PLEASE

00:26:09.134 --> 00:26:11.836
CONTINUE THE DISCUSSION AND I

00:26:11.903 --> 00:26:13.104
WOULD SAY JUST BUILDING ON THAT.

00:26:13.171 --> 00:26:15.240
ALL LACKS LESS CAREFULLY AND

00:26:15.307 --> 00:26:16.875
MAYBE NOT PARTICULAR POETICALLY

00:26:16.942 --> 00:26:18.977
EITHER BUT TRYING TO THINK

00:26:19.044 --> 00:26:20.312
CREATIVELY ABOUT.

00:26:20.378 --> 00:26:21.379
THE COMMUNITIES THEY CAN'T

00:26:21.446 --> 00:26:22.614
AFFORD IT WHAT IS SKIN IN THE

00:26:22.681 --> 00:26:25.216
GAME LOOK LIKE RIGHT LIKE I I

00:26:25.283 --> 00:26:27.719
KNOW THAT --

00:26:27.786 --> 00:26:29.387
PARADISES DIFFERENT AMOUNT.

00:26:29.454 --> 00:26:31.323
AND I KNOW THE MALIBU WANTS TO

00:26:31.389 --> 00:26:33.391
STEP UP AND WHAT AND WANTS TO

00:26:33.458 --> 00:26:34.726
PUSH AND IS WILLING TO TAKE --

00:26:34.793 --> 00:26:37.529
COST ON TO DO SO AND WANTS TO

00:26:37.595 --> 00:26:40.398
REBUILD RESILIENCY PRESENTLY BUT

00:26:40.465 --> 00:26:42.100
SO HOW HOW DO WE SORT OF THAT

00:26:42.167 --> 00:26:43.168
GOOD WILL THAT WE'VE GOT FROM

00:26:43.234 --> 00:26:44.436
SOME IMPACTED AREAS THEY CAN'T

00:26:44.502 --> 00:26:45.603
AFFORD IT VERSUS THOSE THAT

00:26:45.670 --> 00:26:46.538
CAN'T AND I DON'T THINK IT'S

00:26:46.604 --> 00:26:47.672
NECESSARILY IN THAT SAME OLD

00:26:47.739 --> 00:26:48.673
FRAMEWORK EITHER IT'S JUST.

00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:50.041
SOME OF THE PUZZLE ON AS WE GO

00:26:50.108 --> 00:26:51.242
FORWARD IN THIS I THINK IT'S A

00:26:51.309 --> 00:26:52.577
GREAT POINT ONE SIZE DOES NOT

00:26:52.644 --> 00:26:54.179
FIT ALL THESE ARE VERY DIFFERENT

00:26:54.245 --> 00:26:55.647
COMMUNITIES --

00:26:55.714 --> 00:26:56.781
I WILL JUST MENTION BECAUSE I

00:26:56.848 --> 00:26:57.849
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU

00:26:57.916 --> 00:26:59.150
KNOW THE IMPORTANCE OF THE SO

00:26:59.217 --> 00:27:00.919
CALLED HOME HARDENING YES --

00:27:00.986 --> 00:27:02.587
AND REALLY WORKING WITH

00:27:02.654 --> 00:27:04.356
COMMUNITIES TO YOU KNOW PART OF

00:27:04.422 --> 00:27:06.124
THIS IS REALLY REDUCING THE FIRE

00:27:06.191 --> 00:27:07.325
THREAT AS IT APPROACHES A

00:27:07.392 --> 00:27:09.160
COMMUNITY BUT PART OF THIS IS

00:27:09.227 --> 00:27:09.828
ACTUALLY PROTECTING THE HOMES IN

00:27:09.894 --> 00:27:10.495
THE COMMUNITY.

00:27:10.562 --> 00:27:11.696
PARTICULARLY GIVEN A LOT OF

00:27:11.763 --> 00:27:12.597
THESE FIRES ARE INCREASINGLY

00:27:12.664 --> 00:27:14.232
WIND DRIVEN WE HAVE EMBERS

00:27:14.299 --> 00:27:15.033
LEADING --

00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:16.868
THE FIRE SO IN IN SOME OF THESE

00:27:16.935 --> 00:27:19.471
IT'S A DAY --

00:27:19.537 --> 00:27:21.172
CHALLENGES IS HOW DO YOU HELP

00:27:21.239 --> 00:27:23.975
THOSE ARE RESIDENTS ACTUALLY --

00:27:24.042 --> 00:27:25.810
PROTECT THEIR HOMES YOU KNOW ON

00:27:25.877 --> 00:27:27.012
THEIR OWN PROPERTY THAT'S RIGHT

00:27:27.078 --> 00:27:28.546
AND THAT THAT DEFENSIBLE SPACE

00:27:28.613 --> 00:27:30.281
IN THE SORT OF BASIC GUIDELINES

00:27:30.348 --> 00:27:31.950
ARE A CRITICAL AND AND CENTER

00:27:32.017 --> 00:27:33.585
MCGUIRE AND I ARE ACTUALLY DOING.

00:27:33.651 --> 00:27:35.220
TO A HEARING JOINTLY WITH THE S.

00:27:35.286 --> 00:27:38.256
AND NATURAL RESOURCES AND AND

00:27:38.323 --> 00:27:39.157
LOCAL GOVERNMENT.

00:27:39.224 --> 00:27:40.692
AT THAT YOUR AGENCY MAYBE WANTED

00:27:40.759 --> 00:27:43.094
A TENDER OR AT LEAST OBSERVER AT

00:27:43.161 --> 00:27:44.195
PARTICIPATE IN I I KNOW WE'RE

00:27:44.262 --> 00:27:45.663
HAVING A VARIETY TESTIMONY ON

00:27:45.730 --> 00:27:46.931
THAT TOPIC --

00:27:46.998 --> 00:27:48.133
AND TRYING TO SORT ASK SOME OF

00:27:48.199 --> 00:27:49.968
THOSE HARD QUESTIONS ONE OTHER

00:27:50.035 --> 00:27:51.336
TOPIC IF I MIGHT RAISE IT --

00:27:51.403 --> 00:27:52.871
WELL WE GOT YOU HERE IS IN THE

00:27:52.937 --> 00:27:54.439
PROP SIXTY EIGHT CATEGORY WHICH

00:27:54.506 --> 00:27:55.974
I KNOW DOVE TAILS HERE BECAUSE

00:27:56.041 --> 00:27:57.342
YOU ARE ACTUALLY TRYING TO ALIGN

00:27:57.409 --> 00:27:58.510
FOCUS.

00:27:58.576 --> 00:28:02.047
IN MITIGATING SOME OF THESE

00:28:02.113 --> 00:28:03.581
CLIMATE RISKS WE'VE GOT BUT I I

00:28:03.648 --> 00:28:04.616
WOULD SECOND THE THE COMMENTS

00:28:04.682 --> 00:28:05.450
FROM MY COLLEAGUES JUST IN TERMS

00:28:05.517 --> 00:28:07.185
OF IT'S A LITTLE TOUGH GETTING

00:28:07.252 --> 00:28:08.286
THROUGH IT JUST BECAUSE THE

00:28:08.353 --> 00:28:09.888
NATURE OF HOW YOUR PC P. WAS

00:28:09.954 --> 00:28:12.357
STRUCTURED RIGHT SO IT'S ONE BIG.

00:28:12.424 --> 00:28:14.759
CHUNK AND I APPRECIATE WE SORT

00:28:14.826 --> 00:28:16.561
OF STARTED TO TRY TO BREAK

00:28:16.628 --> 00:28:17.762
THINGS OUT IN THE ISSUES BUT

00:28:17.829 --> 00:28:19.097
JUST AS A GENERAL MATTER I KNOW

00:28:19.164 --> 00:28:21.900
WE WANTED TO WORK THROUGH IT

00:28:21.966 --> 00:28:24.002
BECAUSE WE GET THAT SORT OF

00:28:24.069 --> 00:28:25.570
FOCUS ON A SORT OF STREAMLINED

00:28:25.637 --> 00:28:27.105
PROPOSAL BUT IT.

00:28:27.172 --> 00:28:30.442
IT'S HARDER TO ANALYZE.

00:28:30.508 --> 00:28:31.976
EACH ITEM WHEN IT'S SORT OF NOT

00:28:32.043 --> 00:28:33.578
BROKEN OUT BUT FROM WHAT I COULD

00:28:33.645 --> 00:28:35.847
GLEAN FROM IT I DO I JUST WANTED.

00:28:35.914 --> 00:28:38.116
TO I GUESS --

00:28:38.183 --> 00:28:41.419
ASK SPECIFICALLY IN IN THIS SORT

00:28:41.486 --> 00:28:43.688
OF THERE'S THERE'S STORMWATER

00:28:43.755 --> 00:28:45.423
URBAN STREAMS.

00:28:45.490 --> 00:28:47.859
AND MULTI BENEFITS STORM WATER

00:28:47.926 --> 00:28:51.129
CATEGORIES THAT ALL KIND OF

00:28:51.196 --> 00:28:52.664
OVERLAP OR HAVE SORT OF

00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:55.533
DIFFERENT PURPOSES BUT LA RIVER

00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:57.735
IS IT IS A HUGE ISSUE FOR US IN

00:28:57.802 --> 00:28:59.237
THE ENTIRE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

00:28:59.304 --> 00:29:00.071
REGION --

00:29:00.138 --> 00:29:02.107
IT'S BOTH A LIABILITY AND AN

00:29:02.173 --> 00:29:03.475
ASSET --

00:29:03.541 --> 00:29:05.710
COUNTIES REALLY SEEM TO STEP UP

00:29:05.777 --> 00:29:06.978
IN TERMS OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING

00:29:07.045 --> 00:29:07.645
WITH THE STATE LOCAL

00:29:07.712 --> 00:29:09.514
PARTNERSHIPS LIKE THEY THEY SEEM

00:29:09.581 --> 00:29:11.416
TO REALLY --

00:29:11.483 --> 00:29:12.717
BE WILLING TO PUT THEIR SKIN IN

00:29:12.784 --> 00:29:13.918
THE GAME UP FRONT PASSED A

00:29:13.985 --> 00:29:15.653
MEASURE LOCALLY I THINK THAT

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:16.387
COULD HELP --

00:29:16.454 --> 00:29:18.857
I WE APPRECIATE SOME OF THE THE

00:29:18.923 --> 00:29:20.391
FUNDS BOTH GOING THROUGH THE

00:29:20.458 --> 00:29:22.894
CONSERVANCY AS WELL AS THROUGH

00:29:22.961 --> 00:29:24.095
THESE MULTI BENEFITS STORM WATER

00:29:24.162 --> 00:29:25.730
PROJECTS.

00:29:25.797 --> 00:29:27.031
I JUST WANT TO GET YOUR TAKE.

00:29:27.098 --> 00:29:29.167
THE THESE MULTI BENEFIT PROJECTS

00:29:29.234 --> 00:29:31.069
ARE A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN JUST

00:29:31.136 --> 00:29:31.669
THE STRAIGHT FLOOD PROTECTION

00:29:31.736 --> 00:29:32.504
PROJECTS.

00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:34.739
AND I GET THE PUBLIC SAFETY

00:29:34.806 --> 00:29:37.075
RISKS AROUND CERTAIN PARTS SAY

00:29:37.142 --> 00:29:38.276
OF THAT WHOLE.

00:29:38.343 --> 00:29:40.345
FLOOD CONTROL CHANNEL THAT ARE

00:29:40.411 --> 00:29:42.313
IMPORTANT TO SHORE UP BUT I'M

00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:44.382
WONDERING IF YOU THINK.

00:29:44.449 --> 00:29:45.817
YOU KNOW IS THERE GOING TO BE

00:29:45.884 --> 00:29:47.352
ENOUGH TO KIND OF REALIZE THAT

00:29:47.418 --> 00:29:49.654
BIGGER PICTURE VISION BECAUSE WE

00:29:49.721 --> 00:29:51.656
DON'T JUST WANT TO SHORE UP LA

00:29:51.723 --> 00:29:53.224
IS A MATTER OF FLOOD PROTECTION

00:29:53.291 --> 00:29:54.759
I THINK WE CAN SOLVE THAT THAT

00:29:54.826 --> 00:29:55.593
CHALLENGE.

00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:57.629
BUT WE WANTED TO TRULY BE A

00:29:57.695 --> 00:29:59.297
LIVING BREATHING --

00:29:59.364 --> 00:30:01.766
PLACE FOR RECREATION AND AND TO

00:30:01.833 --> 00:30:03.768
IT REALLY DOES SLICE RIGHT

00:30:03.835 --> 00:30:05.069
THROUGH THE THE PLACES WHERE YOU

00:30:05.136 --> 00:30:06.738
KNOW CAN OF THE PARK IS THE LOS

00:30:06.804 --> 00:30:08.573
INCOME PART OF THE DISTRICT I

00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:10.074
REPRESENT WE GOT NOW THE FORTY

00:30:10.141 --> 00:30:10.775
FIVE MINUTES AWAY.

00:30:10.842 --> 00:30:12.243
THESE KIDS NEVER SEEN A BEACH IN

00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:15.513
THEIR LIFE LOOKS LIKE --

00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:16.447
THERE SAID RIGHT AT THE FOOT

00:30:16.514 --> 00:30:17.649
HILLS THE SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS

00:30:17.715 --> 00:30:19.250
BUT THEY DON'T DON'T GET THERE

00:30:19.317 --> 00:30:20.785
LIKE THEY'RE BUSY SCRAPING

00:30:20.852 --> 00:30:22.253
THROUGH AND SO.

00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:23.555
THAT LA RIVER SITTING RIGHT

00:30:23.621 --> 00:30:25.757
THERE IN IN THEIR HOME AND HE

00:30:25.823 --> 00:30:27.392
MAY BE THE CLOSEST THING THAT

00:30:27.458 --> 00:30:28.960
KIND OF COMMUNITY GETS.

00:30:29.027 --> 00:30:30.395
TO GETTING OUT PARK POVERTY

00:30:30.461 --> 00:30:32.197
GETTING THE FEELING OF YOU KNOW

00:30:32.263 --> 00:30:33.831
WHAT IS TO BE OUT THERE SO.

00:30:33.898 --> 00:30:35.700
JUST GENERAL SENSE ON THIS IN

00:30:35.767 --> 00:30:38.236
THIS LA RIVER ISSUE AND AND HOW

00:30:38.303 --> 00:30:40.071
I'D EAT IT HE DOES HAVE A SORT

00:30:40.138 --> 00:30:41.806
OF REGIONAL DIMENSION.

00:30:41.873 --> 00:30:42.907
BUT WE THINK IT'S A UNIQUE

00:30:42.974 --> 00:30:45.877
PROJECT ACROSS THE DELEGATION IN

00:30:45.944 --> 00:30:47.312
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA JUST AS A

00:30:47.378 --> 00:30:49.113
SOMETHING THAT IS COHERENT

00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:51.883
UNSOLVABLE BUT I DON'T KNOW JUST.

00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:53.818
YES WELL TO SHARE MAYBE A COUPLE

00:30:53.885 --> 00:30:55.486
OF OF A HIGH LEVEL TO THE

00:30:55.553 --> 00:30:57.222
PHILSOPHICAL TALKS AND THEN

00:30:57.288 --> 00:31:01.759
SPECIFICALLY SPEAK THE LA RIVER --

00:31:01.826 --> 00:31:02.894
AS CHAIRMAN WHITE HOUSE HE SAID

00:31:02.961 --> 00:31:03.795
YOU KNOW OUR NEEDS OUT SHIP OUR

00:31:03.861 --> 00:31:04.095
RESOURCES.

00:31:04.162 --> 00:31:05.964
ACROSS THE BOARD AND SO THAT

00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:07.398
THAT WOULD THE PROMISE OF MULTI

00:31:07.465 --> 00:31:09.901
BENEFIT PROJECTS AND PROGRAMS IS

00:31:09.968 --> 00:31:12.337
WERE ACTUALLY YOU KNOW --

00:31:12.403 --> 00:31:13.071
GETTING.

00:31:13.137 --> 00:31:14.305
I WAS GONNA SAY KILLING TWO

00:31:14.372 --> 00:31:15.073
BIRDS WITH ONE STONE BUT

00:31:15.139 --> 00:31:16.140
PROBABLY NOT AN APPROPRIATE

00:31:16.207 --> 00:31:17.508
METAPHOR FOR THAT.

00:31:17.575 --> 00:31:21.312
OUR RESOURCES SECRETARY BUT BUT

00:31:21.379 --> 00:31:22.647
IN ANY EVENT --

00:31:22.714 --> 00:31:25.283
IN ANY EVENT WE WE WE NEED IF WE

00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:25.883
NEED TO PURSUE THESE PROJECTS

00:31:25.950 --> 00:31:26.818
THAT ACTUALLY GET MORE.

00:31:26.884 --> 00:31:28.686
ADDRESS MANY OF OUR PRIORITIES

00:31:28.753 --> 00:31:30.088
AT ONCE SO --

00:31:30.154 --> 00:31:31.789
FLOOD IS A PERFECT ONE WOULD BE

00:31:31.856 --> 00:31:33.424
YEAR YOU RAISE AN EXAMPLE OF AN

00:31:33.491 --> 00:31:34.859
URBAN PROJECT THAT ACTUALLY CAN

00:31:34.926 --> 00:31:35.793
HAVE SO MANY MORE BENEFITS

00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:37.328
BEYOND FLOOD CONTROL.

00:31:37.395 --> 00:31:39.330
IN THE ROLE CONTACTS BOB IN DOWN

00:31:39.397 --> 00:31:41.432
THE CENTRAL VALLEY EXPANDING SO

00:31:41.499 --> 00:31:42.867
FLOOD PLAINS.

00:31:42.934 --> 00:31:46.437
IS NOT ONLY A COST EFFECTIVE WAY

00:31:46.504 --> 00:31:47.972
I'M FLOOD THREATS IT ALSO

00:31:48.039 --> 00:31:49.540
PROVIDES HABITAT TO ENDANGERED

00:31:49.607 --> 00:31:51.476
SALMON AND IN MANY CASES ALLOWS

00:31:51.542 --> 00:31:53.011
FOR GROUNDWATER RECHARGE AT

00:31:53.077 --> 00:31:54.412
CIGNA COMES INTO A FACT.

00:31:54.479 --> 00:31:55.913
SO FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THAT HAS

00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:56.781
TO BE ONE OF OUR ORGANIZING

00:31:56.848 --> 00:31:58.116
PRINCIPLES OF INVESTMENTS IS

00:31:58.182 --> 00:32:00.184
MULTI BENEFIT.

00:32:00.251 --> 00:32:01.853
SECONDLY I THINK AS IT RELATES

00:32:01.919 --> 00:32:03.388
TO YOU KNOW A BIG PROJECT LIKE

00:32:03.454 --> 00:32:04.956
THE LA RIVER --

00:32:05.023 --> 00:32:06.557
ONE OF THE CHALLENGES YOU KNOW --

00:32:06.624 --> 00:32:08.860
WE HAVE WITH BONDS ARE YOU KNOW

00:32:08.926 --> 00:32:10.128
THEY'RE OFTEN CAREFULLY WRITTEN

00:32:10.194 --> 00:32:11.462
SO THERE ARE A LOT OF YOU KNOW

00:32:11.529 --> 00:32:13.498
SEPARATE THEIR SEPARATE OP

00:32:13.564 --> 00:32:14.666
CHAPTERS OR PRINT OUT OR

00:32:14.732 --> 00:32:16.034
SECTIONS THAT HAVE THEIR OWN

00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:17.568
FUNDING POOLS.

00:32:17.635 --> 00:32:18.202
THE ONE WE HAVE TO ENSURE THAT

00:32:18.269 --> 00:32:19.504
MULTI BENEFIT PROJECTS CAN

00:32:19.570 --> 00:32:21.673
COMPETE --

00:32:21.739 --> 00:32:24.042
FOR FOR A MULTIPLE STREAMS BUT I

00:32:24.108 --> 00:32:25.877
WOULD SAY MORE BROADLY --

00:32:25.943 --> 00:32:29.314
WE HAVE TO UPDATE OUR OUR

00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:31.015
FUNDING APPROACH FOR THESE MULTI

00:32:31.082 --> 00:32:33.084
BENEFIT PROJECTS IN OTHER WORDS

00:32:33.151 --> 00:32:35.486
YOU KNOW WE'VE HAD TRADITIONAL --

00:32:35.553 --> 00:32:37.488
DIVISIONS BETWEEN FLOOD WATER

00:32:37.555 --> 00:32:39.390
SUPPLY FOR EXAMPLE WELL WHAT

00:32:39.457 --> 00:32:40.124
HAPPENS IF WE HAVE A PROJECT

00:32:40.191 --> 00:32:41.626
DOES BOTH RIGHT WE HAVE TO

00:32:41.693 --> 00:32:42.527
UPDATE THAT.

00:32:42.593 --> 00:32:44.696
WE HAVE A CHANCE TO TALK TO DOT

00:32:44.762 --> 00:32:45.897
DIRECTOR NEED MATH ARE WHO LEADS

00:32:45.963 --> 00:32:46.964
THAT APARTMENT WATER RESOURCES

00:32:47.031 --> 00:32:48.266
HE'S DONE SOME REALLY EXCITING

00:32:48.333 --> 00:32:49.600
WORK ACTUALLY DOING SOME

00:32:49.667 --> 00:32:51.669
RESTRUCTURING AND HER DEPARTMENT

00:32:51.736 --> 00:32:52.770
TO REALLY --

00:32:52.837 --> 00:32:54.672
ELEVATE THIS THIS CONCEPT OF

00:32:54.739 --> 00:32:55.573
MULTI BENEFIT.

00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:57.275
I AND SO WE JUST NEED TO ENSURE

00:32:57.342 --> 00:32:59.577
THAT OUR INVESTMENTS IN OUR

00:32:59.644 --> 00:33:00.178
POLICIES AND PROGRAMS KEEP UP

00:33:00.244 --> 00:33:03.748
WITH THAT.

00:33:03.815 --> 00:33:06.984
OF OUR FOLLOW UP.

00:33:07.051 --> 00:33:07.318
I'LL MAKE IT.

00:33:07.385 --> 00:33:08.119
REALLY QUICK --

00:33:08.186 --> 00:33:09.921
AND I I JUST DON'T WANT TO LEAVE

00:33:09.987 --> 00:33:11.823
THE S. R. A DISCUSSION.

00:33:11.889 --> 00:33:15.560
WITH OUT IN BEING ONE OF THE FEW

00:33:15.626 --> 00:33:17.261
RULE AREA ABOUT.

00:33:17.328 --> 00:33:18.496
THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT BUDGET

00:33:18.563 --> 00:33:20.565
DEAL THAT WAS STRUCK OUT

00:33:20.631 --> 00:33:22.333
BIPARTISAN DO I MIGHT ADD.

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:24.102
ON THE S. R. A FEE AND WHAT WE

00:33:24.168 --> 00:33:26.671
SIGNED MANY RURAL COMMUNITIES IS

00:33:26.738 --> 00:33:30.141
THAT BECAUSE OF THAT HUNDRED

00:33:30.208 --> 00:33:30.708
NINETEEN HUNDRED FIFTY NINE

00:33:30.775 --> 00:33:31.709
DOLLAR FEE.

00:33:31.776 --> 00:33:32.543
AND YOU HAVE A LOCAL FIRE

00:33:32.610 --> 00:33:33.978
DEPARTMENT VOLUNTEER FIRE

00:33:34.045 --> 00:33:35.313
COMPANY FIRE DISTRICT THEY

00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:36.347
DESPERATELY NEEDED REVENUE THEY

00:33:36.414 --> 00:33:38.683
COULDN'T PASS IT BECAUSE THEY

00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:39.650
HAVE THE S. OR A FEE ON THEIR

00:33:39.717 --> 00:33:40.651
HOME.

00:33:40.718 --> 00:33:42.720
AND CAL FIRED ANYMORE TO RESPOND

00:33:42.787 --> 00:33:44.288
WHEN THERE IS A FIRE OR MEDICAL

00:33:44.355 --> 00:33:45.690
EMERGENCY BUT THE LOCAL FIRE

00:33:45.757 --> 00:33:46.724
DEPARTMENT DID.

00:33:46.791 --> 00:33:49.427
SO THERE ARE MANY RAMIFICATIONS

00:33:49.494 --> 00:33:51.596
IF WE WERE TO PUT THAT BACK IN --

00:33:51.662 --> 00:33:52.663

BUT I I APPRECIATE THE

00:34:10.081 --> 00:34:12.049
UNFAIRNESS OF HAVING SOMEBODY

SOME OF THEM CAN BE USED FOR

00:36:40.097 --> 00:36:41.532
STATE INITIATED ACTIVITIES BUT

00:36:41.599 --> 00:36:43.434

THOSE TYPES OF COMMUNITIES.

00:37:02.286 --> 00:37:02.820
EVEN THOUGH THE BOND WAS JUST

00:37:02.887 --> 00:37:04.121
APPROVED BY VOTERS LAST JUNE

00:37:04.188 --> 00:37:05.690
THERE WAS OVER A BILLION DOLLARS

00:37:06.857 --> 00:37:08.793
BUDGET BY THE LEGISLATURE TO GET

00:37:08.859 --> 00:37:10.194
PROJECTS GOING.

00:37:10.261 --> 00:37:11.796
MOST OF THOSE APPROPRIATIONS

00:37:11.862 --> 00:37:13.464
LAST YEAR WHEN THE CURRENT YEAR

00:37:13.531 --> 00:37:14.899

00:37:14.966 --> 00:37:16.267
ACTIVITIES IN PROGRAMS THAT WERE

00:37:16.334 --> 00:37:17.568
ALREADY THE STATE WAS ALREADY

00:37:17.635 --> 00:37:19.003
RUNNING SO THEY WERE READY TO

00:37:19.070 --> 00:37:20.571
HIT THE GROUND IMMEDIATELY.

00:37:20.638 --> 00:37:21.939

READY TO INITIATE NEW PROGRAMS --

00:37:26.611 --> 00:37:29.280
SO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE TWO WE'VE

00:37:29.347 --> 00:37:31.882
GOT A SUMMARY HERE OF THE EACH

00:37:31.949 --> 00:37:32.950
CATEGORY WE WE DID SOME

00:37:33.017 --> 00:37:34.852
CONSOLIDATING WE DIDN'T SHOW ALL

00:37:34.919 --> 00:37:35.453
SEVENTY FIVE I THINK THOSE ARE

00:37:35.519 --> 00:37:37.355
ALL BROKEN OUT IN YOUR AGENDA

00:37:37.421 --> 00:37:39.256
BUT THIS IS A LITTLE BIT --

00:37:39.323 --> 00:37:42.059
MORE CONSOLIDATED SEE HOW MUCH

00:37:42.126 --> 00:37:43.694
THE BOND PROVIDES HOW MUCH WAS

00:37:43.761 --> 00:37:45.363
PROVIDED IN THE CURRENT YEAR AND

00:37:45.429 --> 00:37:46.631
THEN THE PROPOSAL FROM THE

00:37:46.697 --> 00:37:47.999
GOVERNOR IN THE FINAL COLUMN

00:37:48.065 --> 00:37:50.001
THAT IS BEFORE YOU FOR THE

00:37:50.067 --> 00:37:50.868
BUDGET YEAR.

00:37:50.935 --> 00:37:52.403
I'LL HIGHLIGHT A FEW THINGS YOU

00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:54.205
CAN SEE AND THE RIGHT HAND

00:37:54.271 --> 00:37:55.239
COLUMN THERE ARE SEVERAL

00:37:55.306 --> 00:37:56.540
CATEGORIES I HAVE VERY SMALL

00:37:56.607 --> 00:37:58.242
AMOUNTS OF MONEY PROPOSED FOR

00:37:58.309 --> 00:37:59.443
THE BUDGET YEAR.

00:37:59.510 --> 00:38:01.612
AND THAT'S USUALLY BECAUSE IN

00:38:01.679 --> 00:38:04.081
MOST CASES BECAUSE LARGER

00:38:04.148 --> 00:38:04.649
AMOUNTS WERE PROVIDED IN THE

00:38:04.715 --> 00:38:06.150
CURRENT YEAR --

00:38:06.217 --> 00:38:08.219
THERE ARE FEW AREAS WHERE NO

00:38:08.285 --> 00:38:10.121
FUNDING IS PROVIDED ARE VERY

00:38:10.187 --> 00:38:12.223
SMALL ACROSS THE TWO YEARS AND

00:38:12.289 --> 00:38:13.924
THAT'S GENERALLY BECAUSE EITHER

00:38:13.991 --> 00:38:15.026
A DEPARTMENTS ARE STILL GETTING

00:38:15.092 --> 00:38:18.329

AND ARE READY TO SPEND THE FUNDS

00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:20.531

00:38:20.598 --> 00:38:22.199
THEY HAVE BOND FUNDING FROM

00:38:22.266 --> 00:38:23.367
PREVIOUS BONDS THAT ARE STILL

00:38:23.434 --> 00:38:24.568
AVAILABLE SO WE'RE KIND OF

00:38:24.635 --> 00:38:27.438

GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL SEEM

00:39:32.069 --> 00:39:33.237
CONSISTENT WITH THE BOND

00:39:33.304 --> 00:39:34.772
LANGUAGE AND VOTER INTENT WE

00:39:34.839 --> 00:39:36.841
DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING WILD AND

00:39:36.907 --> 00:39:38.843
CRAZY IN OUR LOOK AT WHAT THE

00:39:38.909 --> 00:39:40.211
GOVERNOR IS PROPOSING.

00:39:40.277 --> 00:39:42.279
BUT AS HAS ALREADY BEEN NOTED BY

00:39:42.346 --> 00:39:43.948
A FEW OF YOU ON THE DíAS THERE

00:39:44.014 --> 00:39:45.382
WAS A LACK OF DETAIL IN THE

00:39:45.449 --> 00:39:47.084
PRESENTATION FROM FROM THE

00:39:47.151 --> 00:39:49.019
GOVERNOR ON THESE PROPOSALS THAT

00:39:49.086 --> 00:39:50.821
MADE IT DIFFICULT. TO TO DIVE

00:39:50.888 --> 00:39:52.056
DEEP INTO UNDERSTANDING WHAT

00:39:52.123 --> 00:39:53.090
THAT THAT SOME OF THE PROPOSALS

00:39:53.157 --> 00:39:54.725
REALLY ARE FOR SOME OF THE

00:39:54.792 --> 00:39:56.227
PROGRAMS THAT THE STATE HAS BEEN

00:39:56.293 --> 00:39:57.795
RUNNING FOR MANY YEARS THAT'S A

00:39:57.862 --> 00:39:59.563
LITTLE BIT LESS CONCERNING. FOR

00:39:59.630 --> 00:40:00.731
SOME OF THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE

00:40:00.798 --> 00:40:03.067
BRAND NEW THIS YEAR IT REALLY.

00:40:03.134 --> 00:40:04.702
WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS

00:40:04.769 --> 00:40:06.170
MORE DETAIL ON HOW WELL THE

00:40:06.237 --> 00:40:08.205
FUNDING BE SPENT WHY IS THIS

00:40:08.272 --> 00:40:09.840
AMOUNT THE AMOUNT THAT'S

00:40:09.907 --> 00:40:11.509
APPROPRIATE FOR THIS YEAR. FOR

00:40:11.575 --> 00:40:13.344
NEW STAFF THERE FIFTEEN NEW

00:40:13.410 --> 00:40:15.980
STAFF PROPOSED WAY WHY ARE THEY

00:40:16.046 --> 00:40:17.615
NECESSARY WHAT WHAT ACTIVITIES

00:40:17.681 --> 00:40:19.517
WILL THEY BE UNDERTAKING --

00:40:19.583 --> 00:40:21.051
SO I WILL WANT TO GIVE THEN

00:40:21.118 --> 00:40:21.952
MINISTRATION CREDIT THEY'VE BEEN

00:40:22.019 --> 00:40:23.387
VERY RESPONSIVE TO ALL OF OUR%

00:40:23.454 --> 00:40:25.589
QUESTIONS AND REQUESTS FOR

00:40:25.656 --> 00:40:27.057
INFORMATION BUT OF COURSE.

00:40:27.124 --> 00:40:28.292
THAT INFORMATION IS NOT AS

00:40:28.359 --> 00:40:30.194
EASILY ACCESSIBLE FROM THE

00:40:30.261 --> 00:40:31.495
PUBLIC AS IT WOULD BE HAD IT

00:40:31.562 --> 00:40:33.030
BEEN PROVIDED IN A BUDGET CHANGE

00:40:33.097 --> 00:40:34.031
PROPOSAL SO THEY'VE BEEN VERY

00:40:34.098 --> 00:40:35.533
RECEPTIVE ABOUT THIS FEEDBACK

00:40:35.599 --> 00:40:36.300
AND I THINK.

00:40:36.367 --> 00:40:37.968
WILL IMPROVE THE PROCESS MOVING

00:40:38.035 --> 00:40:40.004
FORWARD BUT IT DOES THAT PUT A

00:40:40.070 --> 00:40:41.338
LITTLE BIT MORE OF THE ONUS ON

00:40:41.405 --> 00:40:43.107
YOU TO GET THE INFORMATION THAT

00:40:43.174 --> 00:40:47.011
YOU NEED TO FEEL COMFORTABLE

00:40:47.077 --> 00:40:47.578
APPROVING THESE PROPOSALS.

00:40:47.645 --> 00:40:48.179
SO WE THINK THIS IS A REALLY

00:40:48.245 --> 00:40:49.013
GOOD STARTING PLACE FOR YOU BUT

00:40:49.079 --> 00:40:51.415
IT'S NOT THE ONLY WAY TO PROCEED --

00:40:51.482 --> 00:40:53.250
THERE YOU COULD CHOOSE TO PUT

00:40:53.317 --> 00:40:54.885
MORE FUNDING IN THE BUDGET FOR

00:40:54.952 --> 00:40:56.921
CERTAIN CATEGORIES OR LESS

00:40:56.987 --> 00:40:58.556
FUNDING FOR CERTAIN CATEGORIES

00:40:58.622 --> 00:41:00.057
SO WE WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO USE.

00:41:00.124 --> 00:41:00.891
THE SPRING BUDGET PROCESS TO

00:41:00.958 --> 00:41:03.527
REALLY GET FEET HOLDERS FROM

00:41:03.594 --> 00:41:05.095
IMPLEMENTING DEPARTMENTS THERE

00:41:05.162 --> 00:41:06.363
MAY BE CERTAIN CASES WHERE THE

00:41:06.430 --> 00:41:07.865
GOVERNOR HASN'T PROPOSED FUNDING

00:41:07.932 --> 00:41:09.700
WHERE THERE IS DEMAND READY TO

00:41:09.767 --> 00:41:11.235
GO NOW AND PROJECTS READY TO

00:41:11.302 --> 00:41:12.670

PUT SOME ADDITIONAL FUNDING IN.

00:41:14.338 --> 00:41:15.539
THERE COULD ALSO BE CATEGORIES

00:41:15.606 --> 00:41:16.907
WHERE YOU LEARNED THAT THERE IS

00:41:16.974 --> 00:41:18.309
QUITE A BIT OF PREVIOUS BOND

00:41:18.375 --> 00:41:19.610
FUNDING THAT'S GONE UNSPENT AND

00:41:19.677 --> 00:41:20.845
MAYBE THEY'RE NOT READY FOR THIS

00:41:20.911 --> 00:41:22.613
AMOUNT OF PROPOSITION SIXTY

00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:24.748
EIGHT FUNDING IN THE BUDGET YEAR

00:41:24.815 --> 00:41:27.051
YET SO -- AS

00:41:27.117 --> 00:41:28.252
ALWAYS WE WOULD RECOMMEND THAT

00:41:28.319 --> 00:41:29.086
YOU ADOPT A PACKAGE THAT

00:41:29.153 --> 00:41:30.421

STARTING PLACE.

00:41:34.592 --> 00:41:35.593
SOMEONE THE CHALLENGES THAT WE

00:41:35.659 --> 00:41:37.361
HAVE BECAUSE THINGS SEEM TO BE

00:41:37.428 --> 00:41:39.330
HIDDEN IS THAT YOU KNOW LAST

00:41:39.396 --> 00:41:42.233
YEAR WE FIRST HAD THE PROP SIXTY

00:41:42.299 --> 00:41:43.801
EIGHT WE SAW SOME.

00:41:43.868 --> 00:41:45.236
ARE PROJECTS OF JUST PICK ON

00:41:45.302 --> 00:41:46.770
HEALTHY SOILS THAT WERE BEING

00:41:46.837 --> 00:41:49.106
USE OF THAT WERE BEING FUNDED BY

00:41:49.173 --> 00:41:50.975
CAP AND TRADE FUNDS THAT ALL OF

00:41:51.041 --> 00:41:51.742
A SUDDEN.

00:41:51.809 --> 00:41:54.011
THE CAP AND TRADE FUNDS DRIED UP

00:41:54.078 --> 00:41:56.146
IN AND WE HAVE NINE MILLION.

00:41:56.213 --> 00:41:57.948
BROUGHT IN HERE --

00:41:58.015 --> 00:41:59.516
FOR UNDER A PROP SIXTY EIGHT

00:41:59.583 --> 00:42:01.352
WHICH IS ALMOST 90% OF WHAT THE

00:42:01.418 --> 00:42:03.153
FUNDS WERE SO WE'RE TRYING TO

00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:04.922
FIGURE OUT THIS SEEMS TO BE ONE

00:42:04.989 --> 00:42:05.789
OF THOSE.

00:42:05.856 --> 00:42:09.493
IMPORTANT GROWING PROGRAMS RIGHT

00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:11.295

00:42:11.362 --> 00:42:13.330
CHALLENGES ON RECONCILING THOSE

00:42:13.397 --> 00:42:15.099

HOW CAN YOU HELP US OUT ON THAT

00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:25.542

00:44:43.247 --> 00:44:44.214
UNDERTAKING THEY CAME OUT WITH

00:44:44.281 --> 00:44:46.250
THE DRAFT AND DECEMBER I THINK

00:44:46.316 --> 00:44:47.584
AND ARE IN THE PROCESS.

00:44:47.651 --> 00:44:48.719
OF FINALIZING SO I THINK THE

00:44:48.786 --> 00:44:51.155
ADMINISTRATION WAS WAITING FOR

00:44:51.221 --> 00:44:52.389
THE ASSESSMENT BEFORE I'M

00:44:52.456 --> 00:44:53.724
PUTTING FORTH THE FUNDING SO WE

00:44:53.791 --> 00:44:55.526
MAY SEE SOME OF THAT IN APRIL OR

00:44:55.592 --> 00:44:57.461
MAY AS THAT ASSESSMENT IS DONE

00:44:57.528 --> 00:44:58.695
TO GUIDE HOW THAT FUNDING SHOULD

00:44:58.762 --> 00:44:59.930
BE SPENT.

00:44:59.997 --> 00:45:00.931
AND THERE'S THIRTY MILLION FOR

00:45:00.998 --> 00:45:01.832
PARKS AND THIRTY MILLION FOR THE

00:45:01.899 --> 00:45:03.033
COASTAL CONSERVANCY IN THAT

00:45:03.100 --> 00:45:04.701
CATEGORY --

00:45:04.768 --> 00:45:06.070
FOR THE OTHER.

00:45:06.136 --> 00:45:07.337
CATEGORIES A PARKS I'M I WILL

00:45:07.404 --> 00:45:09.573
HAVE TO DEFER TO THE DEPARTMENT

00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:10.641
ON ON WHY.

00:45:10.707 --> 00:45:11.508
THEY TOOK THE APPROACH THEY DID

00:45:11.575 --> 00:45:13.510
MY MY PRESUMPTION WOULD BE THAT

00:45:13.577 --> 00:45:16.413
THERE'S QUITE QUITE A LOT IN THE

00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:18.048
CURRENT YEAR.

00:45:18.115 --> 00:45:19.349
YOU KNOW NEARLY HALF OF THAT

00:45:19.416 --> 00:45:20.784
APPROPRIATION --

00:45:20.851 --> 00:45:21.351
FOR IMPROVING AND EXPANDING

00:45:21.418 --> 00:45:22.986
LOCAL PARK SO MAYBE THAT THEY'RE

00:45:23.053 --> 00:45:24.188
WAITING FOR THAT MANY TO KIND OF

00:45:24.254 --> 00:45:26.590
PERCOLATE DOWN AND AND THEN ROLL

00:45:26.657 --> 00:45:27.458

00:46:26.617 --> 00:46:28.085
WE DO NEED SOME TIME TO GO

00:46:28.152 --> 00:46:30.020
THROUGH THE PROCESS AND AND AND

00:46:30.087 --> 00:46:32.456

THE TRAIL PARKER THE RIVER

00:46:47.037 --> 00:46:48.906
PARKWAY OR THE OTHER PARTS OF

00:46:48.972 --> 00:46:51.842
THE PARK BUT THERE JUST SEEMS AT

00:46:51.909 --> 00:46:53.177
SIXTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS YOU

00:46:53.243 --> 00:46:57.014

SEVENTY MILLION I MEAN IT'S JUST.

00:46:58.348 --> 00:46:59.550
NOT EVEN A HUNDRED OF WHAT THE

NEED IS.

00:47:01.518 --> 00:47:04.154
I I I I GUESS I WOULD ASK THAT

00:47:04.221 --> 00:47:05.989

PROJECTS THAT MAY BE READY TO GO --

00:47:14.531 --> 00:47:15.299
THAT MAY HAVE BECAUSE WHEN THE

00:47:21.338 --> 00:47:22.706
AGAIN IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS

00:47:22.773 --> 00:47:24.541

JUST SEEMS LIKE SOME OF THESE

00:47:37.654 --> 00:47:38.455
CATEGORIES.

00:47:38.522 --> 00:47:39.623
THEY SHOULD BE POINT WEAKENED

00:47:39.690 --> 00:47:42.559

THE PLAN MAY BE RIGHT SO --

00:48:00.010 --> 00:48:01.979
CAN HAVE A GREATER DISCUSSION

00:48:02.045 --> 00:48:03.513
WITH ADDITIONAL DETAIL AND I

00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:05.015
WOULD ALSO SAY THE SAME THING

00:48:05.082 --> 00:48:05.482

MAINTENANCE BUT IT ALSO GETS AND

00:49:34.104 --> 00:49:35.739
OTHER ISSUES TO REGULATE WE CAN

00:49:35.806 --> 00:49:36.707
TALK ABOUT LOW COST BECAUSE

00:49:36.773 --> 00:49:38.008
ACCOMMODATIONS IN THE CAPITAL

00:49:38.075 --> 00:49:38.775

LOW COST ACCOMMODATION.

00:49:54.291 --> 00:49:55.592
ACCOMMODATING YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE

00:49:55.659 --> 00:49:56.927
PEOPLE AND NO ONE AND SO ANYWAY

00:49:56.993 --> 00:49:58.295
JUST A LITTLE THOUGHT ON THAT I

00:49:58.362 --> 00:49:59.696
KNOW MR CASH WE'VE BEEN.

00:49:59.763 --> 00:50:01.231
DOING THIS WORK FOR YEARS WITH

00:50:02.999 --> 00:50:04.935
EVEN TRYING TO SORT OF FIND THAT

00:50:05.001 --> 00:50:06.570
SWEET SPOT BUT JUST LITTLE

00:50:06.636 --> 00:50:08.905
PERSPECTIVE.

00:50:08.972 --> 00:50:14.010
I CAN GO FIRST.

DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ON ON HOW

00:50:24.421 --> 00:50:26.590
THAT MONEY CAN ACTUALLY BE SPENT

00:50:26.656 --> 00:50:27.858
TO GET PEOPLE OUT TO THE PARKS

00:50:27.924 --> 00:50:28.792

ACTUALLY FIGURING ON ON WHAT WE

00:50:46.176 --> 00:50:48.078
CAN SPEND THAT MONEY ON IN ORDER

00:50:48.145 --> 00:50:50.580
TO INCREASE ACCESS.

00:50:50.647 --> 00:50:52.783
ACROSS THE BOARD.

00:50:52.849 --> 00:50:54.418
YEAH AND I WOULD JUST ADD.

00:50:54.484 --> 00:50:57.387
THE FUNDS TYPICALLY I FROM WE

00:50:57.454 --> 00:50:58.655
SHOULD BE THOUGHT OF FOR KIND OF

00:50:58.722 --> 00:51:00.991
LARGE ONE TIME ACTIVITIES FOR

00:51:01.057 --> 00:51:02.859
SEVERAL REASONS ONE BECAUSE

00:51:02.926 --> 00:51:03.760
LEGALLY.

00:51:03.827 --> 00:51:04.895
HAVE FOR THAT'S THAT'S TYPICALLY

00:51:04.961 --> 00:51:06.329
HOW THEY HAVE TO BE USED TO

00:51:06.396 --> 00:51:07.397
BECAUSE IT IS ONE TIME MONEY SO

00:51:07.464 --> 00:51:08.732
IF YOU BUILD UP AN ONGOING

00:51:08.799 --> 00:51:09.466
SERVICE AND THEN THE FUNDS

00:51:09.533 --> 00:51:11.067
AREN'T THERE THAT LEADS TO A LOT

00:51:11.134 --> 00:51:11.935
OF PROBLEMS.

00:51:12.002 --> 00:51:13.036
AND DISAPPOINTMENT AND THIRD

00:51:13.103 --> 00:51:14.604
BECAUSE IT AS THE SECRETARY

00:51:14.671 --> 00:51:16.139
NOTED THAT IT'S NOT FREE MONEY

00:51:16.206 --> 00:51:17.908
IS NOT CHEAP MONEY IT'S KIND OF

00:51:17.974 --> 00:51:19.309
EXPENSIVE MONEY --

00:51:19.376 --> 00:51:21.077
BECAUSE OF THAT THE DEBT SERVICE

00:51:21.144 --> 00:51:22.846
ASSOCIATED WITH THAT SO REALLY

00:51:22.913 --> 00:51:24.815
FOCUSING ON THOSE LARGE PROJECTS

00:51:24.881 --> 00:51:27.017
THAT NEED AN UP FRONT INFUSION

00:51:27.083 --> 00:51:27.517
HAVE.

00:51:27.584 --> 00:51:28.485
FUNDING --

00:51:28.552 --> 00:51:29.686
AND AND THAT MAKES THE TRADE OFF

00:51:29.753 --> 00:51:30.687
FOR THAT THE FACT THAT FUTURE

00:51:30.754 --> 00:51:32.756
GENERATIONS WILL HAVE TO BE

00:51:32.823 --> 00:51:33.657
PAYING IT OFF.

00:51:33.723 --> 00:51:37.427
IN AND SO IN TERMS OF MY

00:51:37.494 --> 00:51:38.762
QUESTION ABOUT.

00:51:38.829 --> 00:51:39.629
ASSESSING NEED AND SORT OF

00:51:39.696 --> 00:51:41.398
MEASURING OUR SUCCESS TOWARDS AT

00:51:41.465 --> 00:51:42.566
LEAST SOME BASIC GOALS.

00:51:42.632 --> 00:51:44.334
WE RECOGNIZE.

00:51:44.401 --> 00:51:46.803
RESOURCES A TOUGH PLACE TO TO

00:51:46.870 --> 00:51:49.039
HAVE REALLY CONCRETE METRICS OF

00:51:49.105 --> 00:51:50.073
WHAT WHAT IS A RESILIENT

00:51:50.140 --> 00:51:51.508
CALIFORNIA LOOK LIKE LIKE HOW DO

00:51:51.575 --> 00:51:53.043
WE DEFINE WHAT IS ACT LIKE WHAT

00:51:53.109 --> 00:51:55.245
IS FULL LACKS ACCESS FOR ALL

00:51:55.312 --> 00:51:55.879
CALIFORNIA FOR ALL ACTUALLY LOOK

00:51:55.946 --> 00:51:57.147
LIKE.

00:51:57.214 --> 00:51:58.448
IT'S A ROUGH FART IT'S NOT PURE

00:51:58.515 --> 00:51:59.883
SCIENCE ALWAYS.

00:51:59.950 --> 00:52:01.952
BUT IS THERE I GUESS START WITH

00:52:02.018 --> 00:52:03.086
THE ADMINISTRATION IS WHAT ANY

00:52:03.153 --> 00:52:05.121
THINKING ABOUT GOAL SETTING IN

00:52:05.188 --> 00:52:06.556
THAT WAY EASIER WAYS TO SORT OF

00:52:06.623 --> 00:52:09.459
MEASURE PROGRESS OVER TIME ONE

00:52:09.526 --> 00:52:10.794
GOOD EXAMPLE IS THE COASTAL

00:52:10.861 --> 00:52:12.596
CONSERVANCY I SERVE ON THE COAST

00:52:12.662 --> 00:52:14.431
GUARD SERVANTS HE BOARD FOR THE

00:52:14.498 --> 00:52:17.300
THE SECRETARY AND THEY HAVE.

00:52:17.367 --> 00:52:17.868
A STRATEGIC PLAN WHERE THEY

00:52:17.934 --> 00:52:20.670
ACTUALLY MAY FOR THE FIVE YEARS

00:52:20.737 --> 00:52:23.073
AT A TIME TO FIGURE OUT OKAY HOW.

00:52:23.139 --> 00:52:24.541
HOW MANY MORE PEOPLE DO WE WANT

00:52:24.608 --> 00:52:26.309
TO GET ACCESS TO THE COAST --

00:52:26.376 --> 00:52:27.844
HOW MUCH MORE LAND DO WE WANT TO

00:52:27.911 --> 00:52:28.845
PURCHASE?

00:52:28.912 --> 00:52:30.247
HOW MANY MORE PROJECTS ARE WE

00:52:30.313 --> 00:52:31.548
GONNA FUND THAT ACTUALLY GIVE

00:52:31.615 --> 00:52:33.416
PEOPLE ACCESS --

00:52:33.483 --> 00:52:35.752
TO BEACHES TO THE COASTAL AREAS

00:52:35.819 --> 00:52:37.387
ON HOW MANY MILES A TRAIL THE

00:52:37.454 --> 00:52:38.688
COASTAL TRAILER WE GOING TO

00:52:38.755 --> 00:52:39.589
PRODUCE SO.

00:52:39.656 --> 00:52:41.124
THOSE METRICS REALLY HELP THEM

00:52:41.191 --> 00:52:43.159
AND HELP US AS A BOARD DECIDE

00:52:43.226 --> 00:52:43.727
WHERE WE WANT TO INVEST THE

00:52:43.793 --> 00:52:45.328
MONEY.

00:52:45.395 --> 00:52:46.129
AND SO DO YOU THINK THERE'S A

00:52:46.196 --> 00:52:47.597
CHANCE TO APPLY THAT SAME KIND

00:52:47.664 --> 00:52:50.534
OF SYSTEMATIC APPROACH MORE

00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:51.701
BROADLY AROUND THIS SORT OF

00:52:51.768 --> 00:52:55.238
RESILIENCY --

00:52:55.305 --> 00:52:56.640
PUSH THAT SEEMS LIKE THE CENTRAL

00:52:56.706 --> 00:52:58.108
DRIVING.

00:52:58.174 --> 00:52:59.809
THEME MORE AT ONE OF THE THINGS

00:52:59.876 --> 00:53:01.344
WE DO TO IS IF THERE ARE

00:53:01.411 --> 00:53:03.113
STATEWIDE THEMES WE WORK WITH

00:53:03.179 --> 00:53:04.915
OUR GRANT PROGRAMS TO ACTUALLY

00:53:04.981 --> 00:53:06.383
INCLUDE THAT INFORMATION IN

00:53:06.449 --> 00:53:07.417
THEIR GUIDELINES.

00:53:07.484 --> 00:53:08.919
SO IT SPREAD ACROSS THE WHOLE

00:53:08.985 --> 00:53:10.387
AGENCY SO IF THERE'S SOMETHING

00:53:10.453 --> 00:53:11.855
WE REALLY WANT TO EMPHASIZE.

00:53:11.922 --> 00:53:13.490
WE CAN DO THAT THROUGHOUT ALL

00:53:13.557 --> 00:53:15.492
THE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS.

00:53:15.559 --> 00:53:17.394
I I GUESS WHAT I'M I'M SORT OF

00:53:17.460 --> 00:53:18.461
GETTING THAT MAYBE IS EMILIO YOU

00:53:18.528 --> 00:53:20.363
CAN HELP JUST GIVE US SOME

00:53:20.430 --> 00:53:22.899
ADVICE ON ON GOING BASED ON IS.

00:53:22.966 --> 00:53:24.434
WE'RE GONNA SPEND ALL THIS THE

00:53:24.501 --> 00:53:26.303
BOND IN GENERAL FUND ANOTHER

00:53:26.369 --> 00:53:27.170
DOLLARS.

00:53:27.237 --> 00:53:29.205
ON TRY TO MAKE CALIFORNIA MORE

00:53:29.272 --> 00:53:30.640
RESILIENT MEANWHILE GOT A A

00:53:30.707 --> 00:53:32.576
MAJOR WILDFIRE LIABILITY ISSUE

00:53:32.642 --> 00:53:33.543
THAT WE'RE WRESTLING WITH IS A

00:53:33.610 --> 00:53:34.878
LEGISLATURE RIGHT NOW WE'RE

00:53:34.945 --> 00:53:36.646
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE

00:53:36.713 --> 00:53:38.448
REDUCE RISK RIGHT HAD THAT SORT

00:53:38.515 --> 00:53:40.116
OF REDUCE THAT COST IT'S GOING

00:53:40.183 --> 00:53:42.285
TO BE BORNE BY SOMEONE FROM.

00:53:42.352 --> 00:53:43.587
THESE CLIMATE CATASTROPHES.

00:53:43.653 --> 00:53:45.589
AND SO I THINK WHEN YOU KNOW

00:53:45.655 --> 00:53:47.223
YOU'VE GOT.

00:53:47.290 --> 00:53:48.658
THE MARKET SORT OF LOOKING SAID

00:53:48.725 --> 00:53:50.327
OUR UTILITY SECTOR IN SAYING

00:53:50.393 --> 00:53:51.027
THAT THEY'RE LOOKING A VERY

00:53:51.094 --> 00:53:52.462
NARROW KIND OF RISK ANALYSIS IF

00:53:52.529 --> 00:53:53.797
WE'RE ABLE TO MAKE OUR

00:53:53.863 --> 00:53:55.165
COMMUNITIES SAFER.

00:53:55.231 --> 00:53:56.766
AND HAVE LESS RISK TO SAY

00:53:56.833 --> 00:53:58.868
HOMEOWNERS AT THE END OF THE

00:53:58.935 --> 00:54:00.337
LINE WHO.

00:54:00.403 --> 00:54:01.671
NOT NECESSARILY JUST FROM A PURE

00:54:01.738 --> 00:54:03.206
GREED PERSPECTIVE BUT FROM ALL

00:54:03.273 --> 00:54:04.641
THIS OTHER SIXTY EIGHT FUNDING

00:54:04.708 --> 00:54:06.443
ALL THIS THE REST IS LIKE HOW DO

00:54:06.509 --> 00:54:07.644
WE ACTUALLY.

00:54:07.711 --> 00:54:10.480
QUANTIFY RISK REDUCTION EARLY

00:54:10.547 --> 00:54:14.150
SET UP SOME SELF EVALUATION

00:54:14.217 --> 00:54:16.453
FRAMEWORK TO TO KIND OF IS THAT

00:54:16.519 --> 00:54:17.621
IS THAT TO ABSTRACT OR IS IT IS

00:54:17.687 --> 00:54:18.888
SOMETHING LIKE THAT POSSIBLE I I

00:54:18.955 --> 00:54:22.359
THINK IT IS AN IT IS NEW ARE THE

00:54:22.425 --> 00:54:23.793
WAY WE HAVE TRADITIONALLY DONE

00:54:23.860 --> 00:54:24.527
IT IS.

00:54:24.594 --> 00:54:26.029
THROUGH GRAY INFRASTRUCTURE IT'S

00:54:26.096 --> 00:54:27.163
PRETTY.

00:54:27.230 --> 00:54:28.164
STRAIGHTFORWARD WE WANT TO

00:54:28.231 --> 00:54:30.467
PROVIDE WATER FOR THE THE BILL

00:54:30.533 --> 00:54:31.868
THE WATER TREATMENT PLANT THAT'S

00:54:31.935 --> 00:54:32.469
GONNA PROVIDE WATER FOR THIS

00:54:32.535 --> 00:54:33.937
MANY PEOPLE.

00:54:34.004 --> 00:54:34.404
THE WAY THE STATE HAS

00:54:34.471 --> 00:54:36.573
TRADITIONALLY HELD GRANTEES

00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:38.008
ACCOUNTABLE FOR BOND PROJECTS IS

00:54:38.074 --> 00:54:39.009
OKAY IN YOUR APPLICATION YOU

00:54:39.075 --> 00:54:40.243
SAID YOU WERE GOING TO DO THIS

00:54:40.310 --> 00:54:41.578
PROJECT THAT CREATED.

00:54:41.645 --> 00:54:43.246
X. NUMBER OF ACRES OF WETLAND

00:54:43.313 --> 00:54:44.881
OKAY YOU CREATED X. NUMBER OF

00:54:44.948 --> 00:54:46.816
ACRES GREAT YOU'VE DONE YOUR JOB

00:54:46.883 --> 00:54:48.218
BUT THAT BUT THAT ISN'T GETTING

00:54:48.284 --> 00:54:50.320
IT KIND OF THIS NEXT LEVEL OF IS

00:54:50.387 --> 00:54:52.255
IT ACHIEVING THE GOALS WE WANTED

00:54:52.322 --> 00:54:53.323
BEYOND.

00:54:53.390 --> 00:54:55.291
THE CONCRETE MEASURES SO I THINK

00:54:55.358 --> 00:54:57.227
WHEN AGENCY THAT'S THAT'S REALLY

00:54:57.293 --> 00:54:58.094
BEEN THINKING ABOUT THIS IS A

00:54:58.161 --> 00:54:59.729
SIERRA NEVADA CONSERVANCY AND I

00:54:59.796 --> 00:55:00.497
THINK YOU'VE GOT THEM ON OF

00:55:00.563 --> 00:55:01.931
SUBSEQUENT PANEL THEY ARE

00:55:01.998 --> 00:55:03.733
WORKING ON DEVELOPING AT DASH

00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:05.402
BOARD OF RESILIENCE FOR SOME OF

00:55:05.468 --> 00:55:06.836
THEIR FOREST HEALTH PROJECTS

00:55:06.903 --> 00:55:08.438
THAT'S NOT JUST OKAY.

00:55:08.505 --> 00:55:09.706
WE REMOVED --

00:55:09.773 --> 00:55:11.107
AT EXCESS VEGETATION AN EX

00:55:11.174 --> 00:55:12.208
NUMBER OF ACRES BUT WHAT DID

00:55:12.275 --> 00:55:13.643
THAT YIELD US WHAT ARE WE WHAT

00:55:13.710 --> 00:55:16.980
ARE WE ANTICIPATING IT'S GOING

00:55:17.047 --> 00:55:18.548
TO BE.

00:55:18.615 --> 00:55:19.149
FOR YOU KNOW WATER YIELD FROM

00:55:19.215 --> 00:55:20.550
THE FOREST AND WILDLIFE BENEFITS

00:55:20.617 --> 00:55:23.353
AND SO IT'S CERTAINLY MORE.

00:55:23.420 --> 00:55:24.821
CAN A SQUISHY THAN THAN SOME OF

00:55:24.888 --> 00:55:26.089
THE HARD.

00:55:26.156 --> 00:55:27.190
THE HARD.

00:55:27.257 --> 00:55:29.159
CONCRETE ANSWERS BUT ITHINK IT

00:55:29.225 --> 00:55:30.827
CAN BE GROUNDED IN SCIENCE AND

00:55:30.894 --> 00:55:32.562
AND IF IT IS THEN IT CAN BE

00:55:32.629 --> 00:55:34.731
MEANINGFUL SO THAT MAY BE --

00:55:34.798 --> 00:55:35.665
IN A FUTURE AGENDA SOMETHING YOU

00:55:35.732 --> 00:55:37.167
WANT TO PURSUE AND AND HEAR

00:55:37.233 --> 00:55:38.601
ABOUT SOME OF THE METRICS

00:55:38.668 --> 00:55:39.703
THEY'RE USING AND SEE WHETHER

00:55:39.769 --> 00:55:41.137
THAT COULD BE USED ACROSS ACROSS

00:55:41.204 --> 00:55:42.472
GOVERNMENT BECAUSE IT'S IT'S A

00:55:42.539 --> 00:55:43.073
REALLY IMPORTANT QUESTION OF

00:55:43.139 --> 00:55:43.807
BEYOND.

00:55:43.873 --> 00:55:45.275
DID YOU DO WHAT WE YOU SAID YOU

00:55:45.341 --> 00:55:47.377
WERE GONNA DO BUT DID YOU DO

00:55:47.444 --> 00:55:51.147
WHAT WE WANT YOU TO DO.

00:55:51.214 --> 00:55:53.249
I THINK DE THE CHALLENGES HIS

00:55:53.316 --> 00:55:55.952
HOUSE AFFECTS THE COMMUNITY AT

00:55:56.019 --> 00:55:58.288
THE LARGER BECAUSE WE'VE GOT IN

00:55:58.354 --> 00:55:58.855
ON THE STREET.

00:55:58.922 --> 00:56:01.191
OF WETLAND INSTREAM REPAIR I

00:56:01.257 --> 00:56:02.892
MEAN WE COULD SPEND A TON OF

00:56:02.959 --> 00:56:04.928
MONEY ON THE DAMAGE HAS OCCURRED

00:56:04.994 --> 00:56:06.096
FROM JUST.

00:56:06.162 --> 00:56:10.400
HUMANS ACTIVITY OR THE PREVIOUS

00:56:10.467 --> 00:56:12.869
LUMBAR RAT ACTIVITIES OR THE

00:56:12.936 --> 00:56:14.704
RECENT STORMS AND WE LOOK IN AND

00:56:14.771 --> 00:56:16.539
WE SAY OKAY HOW DO WE REPAIR

00:56:16.606 --> 00:56:17.340
THOSE.

00:56:17.407 --> 00:56:19.309
WE DO DEAL FASHION WAY OR WE

00:56:19.375 --> 00:56:21.044
COULD TRY TO TO DO IT IN SUCH A

00:56:21.111 --> 00:56:23.847
WAY THAT IT THAT IT BENEFITS THE

00:56:23.913 --> 00:56:24.981
FOR THE FLOW OF WATER SO THE

00:56:25.048 --> 00:56:26.483
SENTIMENTS THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO

00:56:26.549 --> 00:56:28.017
NATURALLY FLOW OUT INTO THE

00:56:28.084 --> 00:56:29.552
DELTA OR TO THE BAY.

00:56:29.619 --> 00:56:31.621
IMPROPER OCCUR RIGHT TO HOW HOW

00:56:31.688 --> 00:56:33.957
WE USING THE BEST ENGINEERING

00:56:34.023 --> 00:56:35.759
NOT THE NINETEEN FIFTIES WAY BUT

00:56:35.825 --> 00:56:37.861
IN A IN A A RESILIENT HUESO WERE

00:56:37.927 --> 00:56:40.330
SAYING HOW DO WE INTERACT ANDY

00:56:40.396 --> 00:56:42.999
THAN DOING DAMAGE CORRECTION BUT

00:56:43.066 --> 00:56:44.434
ALSO IMPROVEMENT.

00:56:44.501 --> 00:56:46.002
BECAUSE OF THE OTHER THE OTHER

00:56:46.069 --> 00:56:47.637
BENEFITS THAT WOULD OCCUR TO THE

00:56:47.704 --> 00:56:49.706
YOU KNOW THE ECOSYSTEM IT AT

00:56:49.773 --> 00:56:51.040
LARGE AND THAT'S A BIGGER

00:56:51.107 --> 00:56:51.775
CHALLENGE.

00:56:51.841 --> 00:56:54.244
AND AND I THINK ONE PIECE TO ADD

00:56:54.310 --> 00:56:55.211
IS IF WE WANTED.

00:56:55.278 --> 00:56:57.313
TO PURSUE THIS IT WOULD ALSO

00:56:57.380 --> 00:56:59.449
REQUIRE SOME MORE FUNDING FOR

00:56:59.516 --> 00:57:00.950
ADDITIONAL YEARS OF MONITORING

00:57:01.017 --> 00:57:02.519
AND SEEING KIND OF DOING THE

00:57:02.585 --> 00:57:04.420
SCIENTIFIC FOLLOW UP ON HOW IS

00:57:04.487 --> 00:57:06.856
THE WETLAND PERFORMING IN IS IS

00:57:06.923 --> 00:57:08.324
IS IS THE WATER.

00:57:08.391 --> 00:57:09.559
FLOWING THROUGH OR IS IT GETTING

THOSE ISSUES THAT MAY HAPPEN AND

00:57:17.901 --> 00:57:19.169
THAT ISN'T TRADITIONALLY HOW WE

00:57:19.235 --> 00:57:20.069

RESOURCES WE ARE VERY EAGER TO

01:03:16.826 --> 01:03:18.294
ENGAGE IN THIS VOLUNTARY

01:03:18.361 --> 01:03:19.996
AGREEMENTS PROCESS.

01:03:20.062 --> 01:03:21.430
IS NOT ONLY DOES IT PROMISED

01:03:21.497 --> 01:03:23.699
BENEFITS FOR WATER SUPPLY BUT

01:03:23.766 --> 01:03:25.535
ALSO WATER QUALITY AND IT ALSO

01:03:25.601 --> 01:03:28.004
ENTAILS HABITAT RESTORATION

01:03:28.070 --> 01:03:29.572
PROJECTS THAT.

01:03:29.639 --> 01:03:31.174
HELP TO PROTECT OUR WATERSHEDS

01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:32.708
AND HELP TO CREATE.

01:03:32.775 --> 01:03:34.143
CONDITIONS THAT ARE BETTER FOR

01:03:34.210 --> 01:03:36.345
NATIVE FISH SPECIES SO FOR US

01:03:36.412 --> 01:03:37.847
IT'S KIND OF THE THE WHOLE

01:03:37.914 --> 01:03:39.182
PACKAGE IF YOU WILL --

01:03:39.248 --> 01:03:44.153
OF BENEFITS THAT WE WE SEEM.

01:03:44.220 --> 01:03:45.855
I'D ALSO LIKE TO SAY THAT.

01:03:45.922 --> 01:03:47.523
THROUGH THIS PROCESS THERE'S A

01:03:47.590 --> 01:03:49.292
GREAT DEAL OF TRANSPARENCY THERE

01:03:49.358 --> 01:03:50.293
WILL BE A GREAT DEAL OF

01:03:50.359 --> 01:03:52.161
TRANSPARENCY AND THIS IS VERY

01:03:52.228 --> 01:03:53.496
IMPORTANT FOR OUR DEPARTMENT

01:03:53.563 --> 01:03:55.665
IT'S ONE OF OUR CORE VALUES IT'S

01:03:55.731 --> 01:03:56.966
IN OUR STRATEGIC PLAN.

01:03:57.033 --> 01:03:58.668
I THINK BY THE NATURE OF HOW

01:03:58.734 --> 01:04:00.403
THIS PROCESS WILL WORK WITH

01:04:00.469 --> 01:04:01.971
BROAD STAKEHOLDER.

01:04:02.038 --> 01:04:04.907
ENGAGEMENT IT LENDS ITSELF TO

01:04:04.974 --> 01:04:06.375
ALLOWING US.

01:04:06.442 --> 01:04:07.677
TO CONTINUE TO INCREASE OUR

01:04:07.743 --> 01:04:09.745
VISIBILITY OF THE WORK THAT WE

01:04:09.812 --> 01:04:12.114
ARE INVOLVED IN OF THE BENEFITS

01:04:12.181 --> 01:04:13.216
OF THAT WORK AND THE

01:04:13.282 --> 01:04:15.484
STAKEHOLDERS THAT WE ENGAGE WITH.

01:04:15.551 --> 01:04:17.186
SO WITH THAT I'M GONNA TURN IT

01:04:17.253 --> 01:04:18.521
BACK OVER TO DIRECTOR BOTTOM SO

01:04:18.588 --> 01:04:20.189
HERE ARE OUR THOUGHTS ON THE

01:04:20.256 --> 01:04:21.591
QUESTIONS --

01:04:21.657 --> 01:04:24.694
STAFF ASKS ON PAGE.

01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:25.728
FOURTEEN LET ME JUST ACKNOWLEDGE

01:04:25.795 --> 01:04:27.029
I UNDERSTAND IT'S A HOLD OPEN

01:04:27.096 --> 01:04:28.731
ITEM I LOOK FORWARD TO

01:04:28.798 --> 01:04:31.534
CONTINUING THE CONVERSATION.

01:04:31.601 --> 01:04:34.036
I AGREE WITH THE LA --

01:04:34.103 --> 01:04:36.505
REPORT THE THIS EXPENDITURES

01:04:36.572 --> 01:04:38.040
CONSISTENT WITH THE INTENT OF

01:04:38.107 --> 01:04:39.609
THE PROPOSITION.

01:04:39.675 --> 01:04:41.310
PROP SIXTY EIGHT ACTUALLY SETS

01:04:41.377 --> 01:04:41.844
ASIDE TWO HUNDRED MILLION

01:04:41.911 --> 01:04:44.247
DOLLARS. FOR THIS ENDEAVOR SO

01:04:44.313 --> 01:04:46.315
WHY SEVENTY MILLION AND NOT

01:04:46.382 --> 01:04:48.150
SEVENTY ONE OR SIXTY NINE I

01:04:48.217 --> 01:04:50.353
THINK SEVENTY IS A BEST

01:04:50.419 --> 01:04:52.421
PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT RELATED TO

01:04:52.488 --> 01:04:54.991
THE SCALE HERE'S THE SCALE.

01:04:55.057 --> 01:04:56.726
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HABITAT

01:04:56.792 --> 01:04:57.994
RESTORATION INSTREAM FLOW

01:04:58.060 --> 01:04:59.862
IMPROVEMENTS.

01:04:59.929 --> 01:05:02.398
FROM BASICALLY MERCED. TO THE

01:05:02.465 --> 01:05:04.533
DELTA.

01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:07.770
THE TRIBUTARY OF THE TO WOLLEMI

01:05:07.837 --> 01:05:09.605
AND POTENTIALLY.

01:05:09.672 --> 01:05:11.140
THE STATE DOES STANISLAUS IN THE

01:05:11.207 --> 01:05:12.575
MERCED RIVER'S.

01:05:12.642 --> 01:05:13.943
THE DELTA PROPER.

01:05:14.010 --> 01:05:16.779
ALL OF THE SACRAMENTO FROM HERE

01:05:16.846 --> 01:05:18.347
ALMOST UP TO READING.

01:05:18.414 --> 01:05:20.983
AND THE TRIBUTARIES OF THE YUBA.

01:05:21.050 --> 01:05:23.252
THE AMERICAN RIVER THE FEATHER

01:05:23.319 --> 01:05:26.122
RIVER THE MCCALL IN THE RIVER --

01:05:26.188 --> 01:05:27.923
I DON'T THINK I'VE LEFT ANY OUT.

01:05:27.990 --> 01:05:30.926
SO THE SCALE IS A MESS.

01:05:30.993 --> 01:05:33.496
AND IT MATCHES THE NEED.

01:05:33.562 --> 01:05:35.231
WHERE DIRE SITUATION WITH MANY

01:05:35.298 --> 01:05:36.599
OF OUR HIGHLY MIGRATORY FISH

01:05:36.666 --> 01:05:38.401
SPECIES WE NEED TO GET INTO THE

01:05:38.467 --> 01:05:39.535
LANDSCAPE?

01:05:39.602 --> 01:05:41.904
AND TURN DARK YESTERDAY ONE

01:05:41.971 --> 01:05:43.973
FLOODPLAIN CONNECTION REMOVING

01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:46.342
FISH BARRIER --

01:05:46.409 --> 01:05:50.079
PROBLEMS HE'S PUTTING GRAVEL AND

01:05:50.146 --> 01:05:52.515
CLEANING GRAVEL WE NEED TO BE

01:05:52.581 --> 01:05:53.749
DOING THAT YESTERDAY.

01:05:53.816 --> 01:05:56.152
SO WE THOUGHT ABOUT OUR

01:05:56.218 --> 01:05:57.520
MANAGEMENT OF OUR EXISTING

01:05:57.586 --> 01:05:59.622
RESTORATION PROGRAMS AND

01:05:59.689 --> 01:06:01.590
CONCLUDED SEVENTY MILLION WAS A

01:06:01.657 --> 01:06:03.025
BEST PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT

01:06:03.092 --> 01:06:04.093
AMOUNT.

01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:05.695
GIVEN THE BROADER TWO HUNDRED

01:06:05.761 --> 01:06:08.264
MILLION SET ASIDE IMPROPER.

01:06:08.331 --> 01:06:09.899
SIXTY EIGHT HOW WILL WE GO ABOUT

01:06:09.965 --> 01:06:11.667
SELECTING IN PRIORITIZING THE

01:06:11.734 --> 01:06:13.803
USE OF THOSE FUNDS.

01:06:13.869 --> 01:06:16.872
WE EXPECT. TO BE SUBMITTING TO

01:06:16.939 --> 01:06:19.475
THE STATE WATER BOARD OVER TIME.

01:06:19.542 --> 01:06:21.010
A SERIES OF DESCRIPTIVE

01:06:21.077 --> 01:06:22.578
PROPOSALS ABOUT POTENTIAL

01:06:22.645 --> 01:06:24.547
PROJECTS FOR INVESTMENT.

01:06:24.613 --> 01:06:25.581
OUR DEPARTMENTS HAVE BEEN

01:06:25.648 --> 01:06:26.949
RUNNING FOR MANY YEARS

01:06:27.016 --> 01:06:28.484
RESTORATION GRANTING PROGRAMS

01:06:28.551 --> 01:06:30.886
THAT ALLOW OUR SCIENTIST WORKING

01:06:30.953 --> 01:06:32.221
WITH EXTERNAL PARTIES. TO

01:06:32.288 --> 01:06:33.656
PRIVATIZE THE HIGHS RETURNS ON

01:06:33.723 --> 01:06:35.324
INVESTMENT --

01:06:35.391 --> 01:06:37.326
I WOULD IMAGINE RESOURCE AGENCY

01:06:37.393 --> 01:06:39.128
WHICH IS THE BENEFICIARY OF THE

01:06:39.195 --> 01:06:40.629
FUNDS IN THE PROPOSITION WOULD

01:06:40.696 --> 01:06:41.764
BE CONSULTING WITH THE TWO

01:06:41.831 --> 01:06:42.832
DEPARTMENTS.

01:06:42.898 --> 01:06:43.933
AND THE COALITION OF

01:06:43.999 --> 01:06:45.201
STAKEHOLDERS TO MAKE THOSE

01:06:45.267 --> 01:06:48.904
DECISIONS.

01:06:48.971 --> 01:06:50.373
MOSTLY THE IDEA IS USING

01:06:50.439 --> 01:06:52.341
EXISTING FUNDING SOURCES SO IF

01:06:52.408 --> 01:06:53.909
YOU LOOK AT PROP SIXTY EIGHT I

01:06:53.976 --> 01:06:55.311
THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO

01:06:55.378 --> 01:06:57.079
REALIZE IT'S POTENTIALLY.

01:06:57.146 --> 01:06:59.148
FEASIBLE TO USE PROPOSITION ONE

01:06:59.215 --> 01:07:00.249
FUNDS.

01:07:00.316 --> 01:07:02.051
REMAINING PROPOSITION THIRTEEN

01:07:02.118 --> 01:07:04.019
FUNDS WILDLIFE CONSERVATION

01:07:04.086 --> 01:07:06.856
BOARD FUNDS TO ALIGN WITH THIS

01:07:06.922 --> 01:07:09.125
GLOBAL ENDEAVOR TO MAKE THIS

01:07:09.191 --> 01:07:11.127
LANDSCAPE SCALE CHANGE IN THE

01:07:11.193 --> 01:07:13.496
SACRAMENTO IN THE SAN JOAQUIN.

01:07:13.562 --> 01:07:14.497
I'M JUST LOOKING AT THE

01:07:14.563 --> 01:07:17.833
QUESTIONS AND I'LL SAY I THINK.

01:07:17.900 --> 01:07:20.069
THAT COVERS MANY OF THEM I WOULD

01:07:20.136 --> 01:07:21.337
IMAGINE THE FUNDS.

01:07:21.404 --> 01:07:23.038
I KNOW THE FUNDS WILL BE SPENT

01:07:23.105 --> 01:07:24.306
CONSISTENT WITH THE GUIDANCE

01:07:24.373 --> 01:07:26.242
THAT YOU FIND IN THE PUBLIC

01:07:26.308 --> 01:07:27.476
RESOURCES CODE.

01:07:27.543 --> 01:07:30.980
AS WELL AS SECTION SEVEN NINE

01:07:31.046 --> 01:07:32.681
SEVEN THREE TWO AND SEVEN NINE

01:07:32.748 --> 01:07:33.249
SEVEN THREE SIX OF THE WATER

01:07:33.315 --> 01:07:33.449
CODE.

01:07:33.516 --> 01:07:35.618
WHICH PRECISELY DEFINE THE TYPES

01:07:35.684 --> 01:07:37.787
OF ACTIVITIES THAT ARE QUALIFIED

01:07:37.853 --> 01:07:39.388
IS ELIGIBLE FOR INVESTMENT.

01:07:39.455 --> 01:07:41.290
ALSO I THINK TELLS YOU THESE

01:07:41.357 --> 01:07:42.992
FUNDS CAN'T BE SPENT ON OTHER

01:07:43.058 --> 01:07:44.160
THINGS LIKE CONVEYANCE PROJECTS

01:07:44.226 --> 01:07:45.494
IN THE DELTA.

01:07:45.561 --> 01:07:47.496
IN REQUIRE ANNUAL REPORTING BY

01:07:47.563 --> 01:07:49.732
SECRETARY CROWFOOT BACK TO YOU

01:07:49.799 --> 01:07:51.700
ABOUT THE USE OF FUNDS.

01:07:51.767 --> 01:07:54.570
HERE'S MY CONCLUSION.

01:07:54.637 --> 01:07:58.107
CAN YOU GIVE US SOME IDEA OF THE

01:07:58.174 --> 01:08:00.376
TOTAL COSTS IF YOU HAD IF WE HAD

01:08:00.443 --> 01:08:01.877
THE OPEN CHECKBOOK AND WE'RE

01:08:01.944 --> 01:08:04.413
LOOKING AT THIS BOND PROVIDES

01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:05.815
TWO HUNDRED MILLION WHAT ARE THE

01:08:05.881 --> 01:08:07.249
UNDER THE VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS

01:08:07.316 --> 01:08:09.518
WHAT IS THE POTENTIAL.

01:08:09.585 --> 01:08:12.121
FOR APPLICATIONS OR COOPERATION

01:08:12.188 --> 01:08:13.889
THAT AND AND THE MAGNITUDE OF

01:08:13.956 --> 01:08:15.458
THE THE RESOURCES THAT HAVE TO

01:08:15.524 --> 01:08:17.693
BE SPENT SO WE I GUESS.

01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:19.261
I'M GET APPLES AND APPLES HERE

01:08:19.328 --> 01:08:22.932
YES [inaudible]

01:08:22.998 --> 01:08:23.566
THIS [inaudible]

01:08:23.632 --> 01:08:25.100
ENDEAVOR [inaudible]

01:08:25.167 --> 01:08:27.336
IS [inaudible]

01:08:27.403 --> 01:08:30.606
CONTINUING SO SOME OF THE

01:08:30.673 --> 01:08:31.607
NUMBERS ARE SUBJECT TO

01:08:31.674 --> 01:08:33.175
REFINEMENT.

01:08:33.242 --> 01:08:34.443
AS WE GO THROUGH THE DIALOGUE

01:08:34.510 --> 01:08:35.778
WITH THE COALITION AND OF COURSE

01:08:35.845 --> 01:08:37.947
ENGAGE WITH YOU.

01:08:38.013 --> 01:08:40.282
BUT AS A GENERAL MATTER --

01:08:40.349 --> 01:08:41.851
ONE OF THE PRIME FEATURES OF A

01:08:41.917 --> 01:08:43.452
VOLUNTARY AGREEMENT THAT'S

01:08:43.519 --> 01:08:45.387
REALLY ATTRACTIVE TO ME.

01:08:45.454 --> 01:08:47.590
IS THE WATER USERS INVOLVED ARE

01:08:47.656 --> 01:08:50.459
PROPOSING TO CHARGE THEMSELVES.

01:08:50.526 --> 01:08:52.461
IN GENERATE AS I UNDERSTAND IT

01:08:52.528 --> 01:08:53.696
ALMOST SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION

01:08:53.762 --> 01:08:55.130
DOLLARS.

01:08:55.197 --> 01:08:57.600
FROM THEIR OWN CHARGES FOR THE

01:08:57.666 --> 01:08:59.068
PURPOSES OF THE HABITAT

01:08:59.134 --> 01:09:00.836
RESTORATION INVESTMENT.

01:09:00.903 --> 01:09:03.539
THE INCREASE IN STREAM FLOW AND

01:09:03.606 --> 01:09:05.541
NEW SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMS TO

01:09:05.608 --> 01:09:06.742
MONITOR ALL THIS.

01:09:06.809 --> 01:09:09.612
SO OVER HALF A BILLION DOLLARS.

01:09:09.678 --> 01:09:12.715
A IS WHAT WE'VE SUGGESTED ABOUT

01:09:12.781 --> 01:09:13.349
SIX HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN MILLION

01:09:13.415 --> 01:09:15.417
FROM THAT SELF CHARGE.

01:09:15.484 --> 01:09:17.987
COMBINED WITH WE'VE.

01:09:18.053 --> 01:09:19.355
FIGURED OUT THE POTENTIAL OF

01:09:19.421 --> 01:09:21.490
ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY TWO

01:09:21.557 --> 01:09:22.992
MILLION PUBLIC FUNDS THAT

01:09:23.058 --> 01:09:24.827
ALREADY EXIST.

01:09:24.894 --> 01:09:26.295
WHICH COULD BE BROUGHT TO BEAR

01:09:26.362 --> 01:09:27.763
AND IF I MATHIS IS RIGHT THAT'S

01:09:27.830 --> 01:09:30.766
ABOUT ONE POINT FIVE ONE BILLION.

01:09:30.833 --> 01:09:32.468
AS A TOTAL EFFORT.

01:09:32.535 --> 01:09:36.438
ACROSS ALL THAT GEOGRAPHY.

01:09:36.505 --> 01:09:38.607
WE TO INCLUDING THIS TWO HUNDRED

01:09:38.674 --> 01:09:41.110
MILLION THAT'S PROOF CORRECT AND

01:09:41.176 --> 01:09:43.078
THE SEVENTY PART OF WHAT GOD.

01:09:43.145 --> 01:09:44.380
SO HERE'S MY CONCLUDING REMARKS

01:09:44.446 --> 01:09:46.515
ANIMAL POTS FOR QUESTIONS.

01:09:46.582 --> 01:09:48.183
I'VE BEEN DOING.

01:09:48.250 --> 01:09:49.919
THIS WORK IN THE WEST MY ENTIRE

01:09:49.985 --> 01:09:50.953
CAREER --

01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:53.689
FIRST IN THE NONPROFIT SPACE.

01:09:53.756 --> 01:09:54.957
AND NOW --

01:09:55.024 --> 01:09:55.558
THE GREAT HONOR OF SERVING IN

01:09:55.624 --> 01:09:57.927
THIS BILL.

01:09:57.993 --> 01:09:58.961
I'VE NEVER RUN ACROSS MORE

01:09:59.028 --> 01:10:00.763
DIFFICULT [inaudible]

01:10:00.829 --> 01:10:02.598
PROJECT.

01:10:02.665 --> 01:10:04.366
THINK ABOUT THE CHARACTERS FROM

01:10:04.433 --> 01:10:06.168
READING TO MERCED IN.

01:10:06.235 --> 01:10:06.602
ALL OF OUR IMPORTANT

01:10:06.669 --> 01:10:09.138
STAKEHOLDERS --

01:10:09.204 --> 01:10:11.173
THERE'S A LOT OF LEGITIMATE

01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:12.641
CONCERN ABOUT THIS ENDEAVOR YOU

01:10:12.708 --> 01:10:14.944
MAY HEAR PEOPLE CRITICIZE IT YOU

01:10:15.010 --> 01:10:15.477
MAY.

01:10:15.544 --> 01:10:16.445
HEAR PEOPLE SAY WERE DOUBLE

01:10:16.512 --> 01:10:18.414
COUNTING PROJECTS OR THIS IS ALL

01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:20.716
SMOKE AND MIRRORS.

01:10:20.783 --> 01:10:21.884
I THINK ONE OF THE MOST

01:10:21.951 --> 01:10:22.851
IMPORTANT THINGS THAT'S HAPPENED

01:10:22.918 --> 01:10:24.687
IN THE NEW SOME ADMINISTRATION

01:10:24.753 --> 01:10:26.589
IS SECRETARY CROWFOOT.

01:10:26.655 --> 01:10:28.057
AND SECRETARY BLUMENFELD A KELLY

01:10:28.123 --> 01:10:30.092
PA HAVE REALLY INSTRUCTED THE

01:10:30.159 --> 01:10:32.027
TWO DIRECTORS. TO MAKE THIS

01:10:32.094 --> 01:10:34.763
DISCUSSION FULLY TRANSPARENT. TO

01:10:34.830 --> 01:10:36.198
DO IT IN A WAY THAT'S LAYING OUT

01:10:36.265 --> 01:10:37.600
WHAT WE'RE UP.

01:10:37.666 --> 01:10:38.834
TO GOING FROM THE STATE WATER

01:10:38.901 --> 01:10:40.369
BOARD INTEGRATING STATE WATER

01:10:40.436 --> 01:10:41.837
BOARD INVOLVEMENT AND MAKING

01:10:41.904 --> 01:10:42.738
SURE EVERYONE HAS A CHANCE TO

01:10:42.805 --> 01:10:44.607
UNDERSTAND.

01:10:44.673 --> 01:10:46.642
AND OFFER CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM.

01:10:46.709 --> 01:10:48.711
REALLY IMPORTANT MILESTONE LAST

01:10:48.777 --> 01:10:50.746
FRIDAY FORTY FOUR INDIVIDUALS

01:10:50.813 --> 01:10:52.047
INCLUDING SOME OF OUR KEY

01:10:52.114 --> 01:10:53.382
REGIONAL AND NATIONAL

01:10:53.449 --> 01:10:54.984
CONSERVATION GROUPS.

01:10:55.050 --> 01:10:56.785
AND WATER USERS SIGNED A JOINT

01:10:56.852 --> 01:10:58.721
LETTER SAYING THERE'S STILL MUCH

01:10:58.787 --> 01:11:00.422
MORE WORK TO DO.

01:11:00.489 --> 01:11:02.291
NONE OF THIS IS FINAL.

01:11:02.358 --> 01:11:03.892
BUT WE'RE WILLING TO KEEP AT IT

01:11:03.959 --> 01:11:05.060
BECAUSE THIS IS SO IMPORTANT FOR

01:11:05.127 --> 01:11:07.696
CALIFORNIA.

01:11:07.763 --> 01:11:09.264
BUT ON THE DECEMBER TWELFTH

01:11:09.331 --> 01:11:11.467
MEETING THAT THEY LEFT IT OPEN

01:11:11.533 --> 01:11:14.670
THAT TO ADD MORE THINGS CORRECT --

01:11:14.737 --> 01:11:17.106
COLLEAGUES CENTER MCGUIRE.

01:11:17.172 --> 01:11:17.706
THANK YOU SO MUCH IS THAT YOUR

01:11:17.773 --> 01:11:21.610
TO JUST REAL QUICK LITTLE DEEPER --

01:11:21.677 --> 01:11:23.112
THIS CINEMA COUNTY SPENDING TEN

01:11:23.178 --> 01:11:23.812
TO TWELVE MILLION A MILE IN

01:11:23.879 --> 01:11:25.547
TRACK BECAUSE JEOPARDY INTO

01:11:25.614 --> 01:11:27.116
ANOTHER WOULD BE DEBRIS IN

01:11:27.182 --> 01:11:28.450
DEEPER WATER.

01:11:28.517 --> 01:11:30.185
HABITAT EXEDRA.

01:11:30.252 --> 01:11:33.188
AND THAT'S JUST IN THAT SMALL

01:11:33.255 --> 01:11:34.123
CREEK.

01:11:34.189 --> 01:11:36.792
WITH THE COLD WATER SOURCE.

01:11:36.859 --> 01:11:38.927
SO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE SO.

01:11:38.994 --> 01:11:40.863
EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY TWO ALL IN

01:11:40.929 --> 01:11:41.163
[inaudible]

01:11:41.230 --> 01:11:44.533
CORRECT.

01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:46.001
THAT'S THE BUDGET WE PRESENTED

01:11:46.068 --> 01:11:48.437
IN TABLE FIVE INTO SUBMISSION WE

01:11:48.504 --> 01:11:49.505
MADE TO THE WATER BOARD LAST

01:11:49.571 --> 01:11:50.372
FRIDAY OKAY.

01:11:50.439 --> 01:11:54.109
AND THEN TALK ABOUT.

01:11:54.176 --> 01:11:56.078
THE NEED.

01:11:56.145 --> 01:11:57.646
FOR BECAUSE YOU STILL NEED THE

01:11:57.713 --> 01:11:59.448
THAT COLD WATER CORRECT TWO CAN

01:11:59.515 --> 01:12:00.115
YOU JUST.

01:12:00.182 --> 01:12:01.417
WALK US THROUGH THAT IS WELL

01:12:01.483 --> 01:12:02.685
WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ARE.

01:12:02.751 --> 01:12:04.319
IF YOU PUT IN THE WOODY DEBRIS

01:12:04.386 --> 01:12:06.121
THE GRAVEL THE DEEPER WATER

01:12:06.188 --> 01:12:07.589
HABITAT --

01:12:07.656 --> 01:12:09.758
AUSTRIAN HABITAT CAN YOU WALK US

01:12:09.825 --> 01:12:11.260
THROUGH THAT JUST YES.

01:12:11.326 --> 01:12:12.628
SO.

01:12:12.695 --> 01:12:13.696
I THINK THERE'S A COMPARISON

01:12:13.762 --> 01:12:15.531
THAT'S IMPORTANT HERE.

01:12:15.597 --> 01:12:17.966
AND IS A CONSTRUCTIVE.

01:12:18.033 --> 01:12:20.202
ONE IF YOU WERE TO JUST THINK

01:12:20.269 --> 01:12:23.238
ABOUT THIS CHALLENGE FROM THE

01:12:23.305 --> 01:12:23.839
AUTHORITIES AT THE STATE WATER

01:12:23.906 --> 01:12:25.974
BOARD [inaudible]

01:12:26.041 --> 01:12:26.675
IT.

01:12:26.742 --> 01:12:29.878
REALLY IS FOCUSED ON HOW TO

01:12:29.945 --> 01:12:31.947
PRODUCE STREAM FLOW.

01:12:32.014 --> 01:12:34.783
AND THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT.

01:12:34.850 --> 01:12:37.486
IT DOES NOT HAVE THE ABILITY AS

01:12:37.553 --> 01:12:39.488
I UNDERSTAND IT TOO ALSO COMPEL

01:12:39.555 --> 01:12:41.423
HABITAT RESTORATION.

01:12:41.490 --> 01:12:44.026
THE FIXING OF THE LAND.

01:12:44.093 --> 01:12:46.228
THE IDEA OF THE THEORY BEHIND

01:12:46.295 --> 01:12:49.298
THE SETTLEMENTS IS.

01:12:49.364 --> 01:12:51.767
YOU CAN INTEGRATE THE TWO YOU

01:12:51.834 --> 01:12:53.836
CAN COMBINE VAST HABITAT

01:12:53.902 --> 01:12:55.871
RESTORATION WITH IMPROVE STREAM

01:12:55.938 --> 01:12:56.905
FLOWS.

01:12:56.972 --> 01:12:59.274
AND THE INTEGRATION.

01:12:59.341 --> 01:13:01.310
THROUGH A VOLUNTARY EFFORT.

01:13:01.376 --> 01:13:03.579
COULD PRODUCE BETTER RESULTS SO

01:13:03.645 --> 01:13:05.147
WHAT YOU SEE IN THE VOLUNTARY

01:13:05.214 --> 01:13:06.115
AGREEMENTS ARE ALSO FLOW

01:13:06.181 --> 01:13:07.583
COMMITMENTS.

01:13:07.649 --> 01:13:09.318
FLOW COMMITMENTS FROM THE SENIOR

01:13:09.384 --> 01:13:12.221
WATER USERS IN THE TO WOLLEMI.

01:13:12.287 --> 01:13:13.856
IN THE LOWER SAN JOAQUIN RIVER.

01:13:13.922 --> 01:13:15.324
IN THE FEATHERED THE DEPARTMENT

01:13:15.390 --> 01:13:16.759
OF WATER RESOURCES IN THE

01:13:16.825 --> 01:13:17.693
AMERICAN THE BUREAU OF

01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:18.994
RECLAMATION ON THE UNITED STATES

01:13:19.061 --> 01:13:20.829
FRONT --

01:13:20.896 --> 01:13:22.998
VERY OLD SENIOR WATER RIGHT

01:13:23.065 --> 01:13:24.500
USERS IN THE SACRAMENTO SYSTEM

01:13:24.566 --> 01:13:25.968
EAST BAY MUD IN ALL THEIR

01:13:26.034 --> 01:13:27.503
VARIOUS DISTRICTS IN THEM

01:13:27.569 --> 01:13:28.570
CALLING ME --

01:13:28.637 --> 01:13:30.639
OF VARIETY OF WATER USERS IN THE

01:13:30.706 --> 01:13:31.573
AMERICAN.

01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:34.009
OFFERING THEIR COMMITMENTS ON

01:13:34.076 --> 01:13:35.711
THE WAYS IN WHICH THEY WOULD

01:13:35.778 --> 01:13:37.379
MANAGE THEIR RESERVOIRS.

01:13:37.446 --> 01:13:39.014
THE WAYS IN WHICH THEY WOULD

01:13:39.081 --> 01:13:40.582
DIRECTLY FALLOW LAND.

01:13:40.649 --> 01:13:42.484
AND RETURN THAT WATER OTHERWISE

01:13:42.551 --> 01:13:44.686
USE FOR PRODUCTION INTO THE

01:13:44.753 --> 01:13:45.654
RIVER.

01:13:45.721 --> 01:13:48.290
SO THE SETTLEMENTS ALSO INCLUDE

01:13:48.357 --> 01:13:49.658
A SERIES OF COMMITMENTS FOR

01:13:49.725 --> 01:13:51.360
IMPROVING STREAM FLOW AND

01:13:51.426 --> 01:13:53.462
ACHIEVING TEMPERATURE OBJECTIVES

01:13:53.529 --> 01:13:54.696
LIFECYCLE NEEDS FOR SAM.

01:13:54.763 --> 01:13:56.431
IS IT ENOUGH.

01:13:56.498 --> 01:13:58.333
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE GOING

01:13:58.400 --> 01:13:59.935
TO FIGURE OUT THIS COMING YEAR.

01:14:00.002 --> 01:14:01.103
AS WERE IN FRONT OF THE STATE

01:14:01.170 --> 01:14:03.472
WATER BOARD WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:14:03.539 --> 01:14:05.240
SCIENTIFIC SUFFICIENCY --

01:14:05.307 --> 01:14:06.809
THOSE KINDS OF MEASURES.

01:14:06.875 --> 01:14:08.977
I MET MY LAST QUICK QUESTION TO

01:14:09.044 --> 01:14:11.146
YOU YOU BELIEVE.

01:14:11.213 --> 01:14:13.182
DOING THE HABITAT ENHANCEMENT.

01:14:13.248 --> 01:14:15.150
YOU'LL BE ABLE.

01:14:15.217 --> 01:14:16.685
THEY HAVE A DECREASED INCREASE

01:14:16.752 --> 01:14:18.954
OF WATER.

01:14:19.021 --> 01:14:20.522
I AND ACCOMPLISH.

01:14:20.589 --> 01:14:21.490
THE SAME GOALS.

01:14:21.557 --> 01:14:23.292
I WOULDN'T.

01:14:23.358 --> 01:14:25.260
PUT THOSE WORDS IN MY MOUTH.

01:14:25.327 --> 01:14:26.395
I MEAN THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING I

01:14:26.461 --> 01:14:27.663
THINK.

01:14:27.729 --> 01:14:29.631
THAT THERE'S VALUE AND

01:14:29.698 --> 01:14:31.934
CONSIDERING THE INTEGRATION OF

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.036
FLOW AND NON FLOW.

01:14:34.102 --> 01:14:36.705
MEASURES AS A GLOBAL PACKAGE.

01:14:36.772 --> 01:14:38.674
THEN I THINK.

01:14:38.740 --> 01:14:40.542
WE WILL NEED TO ANALYZE THAT

01:14:40.609 --> 01:14:42.010
TRANSPARENTLY WITH OUR

01:14:42.077 --> 01:14:43.679
COLLEAGUES AT THE WATER BOARD IN

01:14:43.745 --> 01:14:45.380
COMPARISON TO IF WE WERE JUST

01:14:45.447 --> 01:14:48.116
REGULATING THE FLOW ONLY ASPECT.

01:14:48.183 --> 01:14:49.284
AND THAT'S WHAT I EXPECT WILL

01:14:49.351 --> 01:14:50.552
HAPPEN IN THE COMING WEEKS

01:14:50.619 --> 01:14:50.853
[inaudible]

01:14:50.919 --> 01:14:53.121
OKAY.

01:14:53.188 --> 01:14:57.659

01:15:15.644 --> 01:15:17.246
ON THESE VOLUNTARY SETTLEMENT

01:15:17.312 --> 01:15:19.147
AGREEMENTS CAN YOU JUST WEIGH IN

01:15:19.214 --> 01:15:20.782
ON THAT HOW YOU'RE THINKING OF

01:15:20.849 --> 01:15:23.518
WHAT CAME INTO THE WALL --

01:15:23.585 --> 01:15:25.721
WHAT GUIDANCE BEFORE WHAT IS IT

01:15:25.787 --> 01:15:29.258
JUNE LAST YEAR SUBSEQUENT?

01:15:29.324 --> 01:15:30.158
AND HOW THAT SORT OF LINES UP

01:15:30.225 --> 01:15:32.160
WITH.

[inaudible]

01:15:39.735 --> 01:15:41.803
SO.

01:15:41.870 --> 01:15:42.838
THERE WAS A LOT OF ACTIVITY LAST

01:15:42.905 --> 01:15:45.507
YEAR -- YOU

01:15:45.574 --> 01:15:47.376
MAY BE REFERRING TO THE

01:15:47.442 --> 01:15:49.878
TECHNICAL LANGUAGE AND PROP

01:15:49.945 --> 01:15:50.512
SIXTY EIGHT THAT ALSO HAS A DATE

01:15:50.579 --> 01:15:52.381
MILESTONE.

01:15:52.447 --> 01:15:55.684
COURSE RELATIVE TO THAT STATUTE.

01:15:55.751 --> 01:15:57.419
DATE MILESTONE THERE'S ALSO

01:15:57.486 --> 01:15:59.354
LANGUAGE AND PROP SIXTY EIGHT

01:15:59.421 --> 01:16:00.355
THAT REVERSE THE FUNDS

01:16:00.422 --> 01:16:04.726
EFFECTIVELY. TO THE AGENCY. TO

01:16:04.793 --> 01:16:06.528
THAT ALLOW THE AGENCY TO USE THE

01:16:06.595 --> 01:16:09.131
FUNDS FOR THE VERY SAME PURPOSES.

01:16:09.197 --> 01:16:10.399
TO FIND IN THE WATER CODE OR

01:16:10.465 --> 01:16:12.234
OTHER PROGRAMS LIKE THE RIVER

01:16:12.301 --> 01:16:14.569
PARKWAY PROGRAM.

01:16:14.636 --> 01:16:17.272
THEN IN DECEMBER OF LAST YEAR --

01:16:17.339 --> 01:16:19.341
MIDDLE OF THE MONTH.

01:16:19.408 --> 01:16:20.609
A FRAMEWORK WAS PRESENTED IN

01:16:20.676 --> 01:16:21.977
FROM THE STATE WATER BOARD ABOUT

01:16:22.044 --> 01:16:23.612
THIS ENDEAVOR.

01:16:23.679 --> 01:16:25.814
AGAIN NOT A COMPLETE WORK.

01:16:25.881 --> 01:16:27.516
AND THEN IN THE SHORT MONTHS OF

01:16:27.582 --> 01:16:29.418
JANUARY FEBRUARY AND TWO

01:16:29.484 --> 01:16:31.353
SECRETARIES AND A RENEWED

01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:33.188
INTEREST AND AN OPENING UP OF

01:16:33.255 --> 01:16:34.456
THE DIALOGUE FOR ALL

01:16:34.523 --> 01:16:35.958
STAKEHOLDERS.

01:16:36.024 --> 01:16:36.992
WE'VE JUST MADE ANOTHER

01:16:37.059 --> 01:16:38.794
SUBMISSION TO THE STATE WATER

01:16:38.860 --> 01:16:40.662
BOARD LAST FRIDAY MARCH FIRST I

01:16:40.729 --> 01:16:42.297
THINK THAT WAS LAST FRIDAY.

01:16:42.364 --> 01:16:45.133
OUR NEXT MILESTONE LAID OUT IS

01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:46.501
TO BE BACK IN FRONT OF THE WATER

01:16:46.568 --> 01:16:49.604
BOARD BEGINNING OF THIS JUNE.

01:16:49.671 --> 01:16:51.540
WITH THE FINAL DETAILS SORTED

01:16:51.606 --> 01:16:53.342
OUT -- AND I

01:16:53.408 --> 01:16:54.443
THINK THAT'LL BE ANOTHER

01:16:54.509 --> 01:16:55.978
IMPORTANT MOMENT OF CLARITY.

01:16:56.044 --> 01:16:57.913
OF COURSE THIS BUDGET DISCUSSION

01:16:57.980 --> 01:16:59.081
WILL RUN THROUGH THAT PERIOD

01:16:59.147 --> 01:17:00.782
RIGHT.

01:17:00.849 --> 01:17:04.152
AND IN MY PERSONAL VIEW SEVENTY

01:17:04.219 --> 01:17:05.921
MILLION IS A FAIR DOWN PAYMENT

01:17:05.988 --> 01:17:06.788
ON NO REGRETS.

01:17:06.855 --> 01:17:08.957
WE NEED.

01:17:09.024 --> 01:17:10.525
TO FIX THIS LANDSCAPE WE NEED TO

01:17:10.592 --> 01:17:13.662
GO INVEST IN THESE PROJECTS --

01:17:13.729 --> 01:17:14.463
END.

01:17:14.529 --> 01:17:15.931
WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN MY VIEW

01:17:15.998 --> 01:17:17.499
HISTORICALLY?

01:17:17.566 --> 01:17:18.633
WE'VE RELIED ON CONGRESSIONAL

01:17:18.700 --> 01:17:20.635
APPROPRIATIONS A WE'VE RELIED ON

01:17:20.702 --> 01:17:22.337
PROMISES TO DO THIS THAT OR THE

01:17:22.404 --> 01:17:23.038
OTHER.

01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:26.975
THINGS WE NEED TO DO.

01:17:27.042 --> 01:17:27.876
THE LIST OF JUST BEEN SITTING

01:17:27.943 --> 01:17:29.945
THERE.

01:17:30.012 --> 01:17:31.413
AND NOW WE'RE WORKING TO

01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:33.315
ASSEMBLE THE VERY PRIME

01:17:33.382 --> 01:17:34.750
LANDOWNERS.

01:17:34.816 --> 01:17:37.152
AND WATER USERS AND FORCED THE

01:17:37.219 --> 01:17:39.154
CONVERSATION INTO A COMMITMENT

01:17:39.221 --> 01:17:41.623
TO DO THINGS AND TO FIND TIME

01:17:41.690 --> 01:17:44.359
TERM.

01:17:44.426 --> 01:17:46.461
WHAT I'M NOT HEARING YOU SAY IS

01:17:46.528 --> 01:17:48.296
WE INTEND THIS SOMEHOW I MEAN

01:17:48.363 --> 01:17:49.898
THIS IS GOING BACK TO THE WATER

01:17:49.965 --> 01:17:51.066
POURED IN OTHER WORDS WE STILL

01:17:51.133 --> 01:17:52.200
HAVE THAT?

01:17:52.267 --> 01:17:54.403
THAT CHECK AND THAT COMPARISON

01:17:54.469 --> 01:17:55.971
AROUND.

01:17:56.038 --> 01:17:58.407
YEAH THIS APPROACH VERSUS WHAT

01:17:58.473 --> 01:18:00.642
THEY'RE PROPOSING.

01:18:00.709 --> 01:18:01.843

01:18:01.910 --> 01:18:03.545
DECIDING THAT HERE YOU'RE SAYING

01:18:03.612 --> 01:18:05.480
REGARDLESS OF HOW THAT THAT

01:18:05.547 --> 01:18:05.947
SHAKES OUT [inaudible]

01:18:06.014 --> 01:18:07.949

I ALSO BELIEVE THAT THIS WORKS

01:18:17.325 --> 01:18:19.528
ONLY IF.

01:18:19.594 --> 01:18:23.065

REGULATORY PURVIEW.

01:18:27.402 --> 01:18:29.204
AND MAKES SENSE FOR THEM IN

01:18:29.271 --> 01:18:30.038
THEIR WATER QUALITY PLAN

01:18:30.105 --> 01:18:34.443

01:30:33.227 --> 01:30:36.030
IT WILL BE ESSENTIAL THAT WE

01:30:36.097 --> 01:30:39.066
HAVE THE WORK FORCE AVAILABLE TO

01:30:39.133 --> 01:30:40.802
REVIEW ALL OF THOSE PLANS IN A

01:30:40.868 --> 01:30:42.003
TIMELY MANNER.

01:30:42.069 --> 01:30:43.971
BUT AS I MENTIONED WE ALSO HAVE

01:30:44.038 --> 01:30:46.307
A VERY ROBUST LOCAL ASSISTANCE

01:30:46.374 --> 01:30:49.410
ROLL THIS IS A PART OF THE SIGMA.

01:30:49.477 --> 01:30:50.545
EFFORT THIS WAS WHAT THE

01:30:50.611 --> 01:30:52.313
LEGISLATURE HAD INTENDED AND IT

01:30:52.380 --> 01:30:53.648
IS A COMMITMENT ON THE PART OF

01:30:53.714 --> 01:30:55.316
THE DEPARTMENT TO CONTINUE

01:30:55.383 --> 01:30:56.684
ASSISTANCE NOT ONLY THROUGH.

01:30:56.751 --> 01:30:58.953
PROVIDING DATA SETS AND TOOLS

01:30:59.020 --> 01:31:01.022
BUT ALSO FUNDING I IN GRANT

01:31:01.088 --> 01:31:02.390
FUNDING SO THIS IS AGAIN WHERE

01:31:02.456 --> 01:31:04.058
PROPOSITION SIXTY EIGHT COMES

01:31:04.125 --> 01:31:05.393
INTO PLAY.

01:31:05.459 --> 01:31:07.895
SO OUR OUR CONCERN AS WE MOVE

01:31:07.962 --> 01:31:09.597
FORWARD AND TRY TO MANAGE THE

01:31:09.664 --> 01:31:13.434
NEW DEVELOPMENTS OF THIS VERY

01:31:13.501 --> 01:31:14.302
VERY NEW MASSIVE PROGRAM.

01:31:14.368 --> 01:31:16.070
IS TO ENSURE THAT WHILE WE ARE

01:31:16.137 --> 01:31:17.772
MANAGING OUR REGULATORY ROLE IN

01:31:17.839 --> 01:31:19.974
DOING THAT EVALUATION WE ARE NOT

01:31:20.041 --> 01:31:22.176
SACRIFICING THE ASSISTANCE ROLE

01:31:22.243 --> 01:31:23.177
AS WELL.

01:31:23.244 --> 01:31:24.712
SO BECAUSE THERE'S CRITICALLY

01:31:24.779 --> 01:31:26.814
OVER DRAFTED BASINS AND WORKING

01:31:26.881 --> 01:31:28.449
AT A DIFFERENT TIME FRAME.

01:31:28.516 --> 01:31:29.884
IN A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF OTHER

01:31:29.951 --> 01:31:31.252
BASINS THAT ARE WORKING WITH

01:31:31.319 --> 01:31:32.353
THEIR TIME FRAME.

01:31:32.420 --> 01:31:34.021
THE ASSISTANCE IN THE REGULATION

01:31:34.088 --> 01:31:34.922
ALL HAVE TO HAPPEN

01:31:34.989 --> 01:31:37.158
SIMULTANEOUSLY OR CONCURRENTLY

01:31:37.225 --> 01:31:38.793
AND THEREFORE WE WANT TO ENSURE

01:31:38.860 --> 01:31:40.528
THAT THERE'S NO ONE POOL FROM

01:31:40.595 --> 01:31:43.097
ONE SIDE. TO THE OTHER IN TERMS

01:31:43.164 --> 01:31:45.466
OF OF THOSE DELIVERABLES --

01:31:45.533 --> 01:31:48.502
SO WITH THE REQUESTED TIONS ARE

01:31:48.569 --> 01:31:50.905
SPECIFICALLY TO ADDRESS THE

01:31:50.972 --> 01:31:52.440
STAFF'S STAFF SHORTAGE --

01:31:52.506 --> 01:31:54.342
VISIT AGAIN IS TO MEET ALL OF

01:31:54.408 --> 01:31:56.911
THOSE REQUIREMENTS BUT LET ME

01:31:56.978 --> 01:31:59.347
EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THOSE

01:31:59.413 --> 01:32:02.216
THOSE ROLES THAT WE HAVE AND WHO

01:32:02.283 --> 01:32:03.317
DO YOU HAVE A QUESTION.

01:32:03.384 --> 01:32:04.385
IS I THINK THERE'S NINE FOR THIS

01:32:04.452 --> 01:32:07.054
EXPECTED GROWTH BUT THERE'S

01:32:07.121 --> 01:32:08.089
NINETEEN FOR OUR OTHER STAFF

01:32:08.155 --> 01:32:09.457
POSITIONS I GUESS.

01:32:09.523 --> 01:32:11.359
I WOULD I WANT YOU TO CONTINUE

01:32:11.425 --> 01:32:13.794
BUT IF WE HAVE IT'S A DUMB

01:32:13.861 --> 01:32:16.297
QUESTIONS I LIKE ASK CONSENT IF

01:32:16.364 --> 01:32:17.899
WE HAVE A HUNDRED BASIS.

01:32:17.965 --> 01:32:18.966
AND WE AND WE'VE WE'VE GOT

01:32:19.033 --> 01:32:20.601
SIGMAN WORSE WE WE REQUIRE

01:32:20.668 --> 01:32:22.536
PEOPLE TO PUT TOGETHER --

01:32:22.603 --> 01:32:24.105
THESE GROUND WATER AGENCIES WHY

01:32:24.171 --> 01:32:25.439
DIDN'T WE JUST GET A HUNDRED

01:32:25.506 --> 01:32:27.608
AGENCIES BECAUSE IF IF WE WANTED

01:32:27.675 --> 01:32:29.310
TO HAVE A COORDINATED EFFORT I I

01:32:29.377 --> 01:32:30.478
SEE THAT THERE'S THERE'S

01:32:30.544 --> 01:32:32.313
DIFFERENT YOU KNOW IT'S A IT'S A

01:32:32.380 --> 01:32:33.948
CRAZY WORLD OUT THERE IN THE

01:32:34.015 --> 01:32:36.117
WORLD OF WATER BUT IF WE WE GOT

01:32:36.183 --> 01:32:36.717
THE WATERSHEDS.

01:32:36.784 --> 01:32:38.619
YOU KNOW WHEN OUR GRANDPA PAAS

01:32:38.686 --> 01:32:39.787
SET UP THE WATER AGENCY THEY

01:32:39.854 --> 01:32:41.055
JUST SORT OF SAID THIS IS MY

01:32:41.122 --> 01:32:44.292
THIS IS AS FAR AS I CAN SEE IN

01:32:44.358 --> 01:32:44.825
THIS IS WHAT I'M GONNA DO

01:32:44.892 --> 01:32:45.126
[inaudible]

01:32:45.192 --> 01:32:48.629
WAS THE WAS THE R. H. YOUR

01:32:48.696 --> 01:32:49.664
RESOURCE AGENCY.

01:32:49.730 --> 01:32:51.866
HELPING WERE COORDINATING

01:32:51.933 --> 01:32:53.367
BECAUSE WE GET GIVE SIX SPOTS

01:32:53.434 --> 01:32:55.169
LAST YEAR WHEN THEY CAME UP WITH

01:32:55.236 --> 01:32:58.005
THIS CAN WE HAVE PEOPLE LOOK AT

01:32:58.072 --> 01:33:00.007
HERE'S THE WATERSHED HERE'S THE

01:33:00.074 --> 01:33:02.076
BASE AND WE'RE ALL HERE ON ONE

01:33:02.143 --> 01:33:03.377
BASIN.

01:33:03.444 --> 01:33:08.049
OF OVER AS WITHDRAWING FROM IT

01:33:08.115 --> 01:33:09.016
AND YOU WERE --

01:33:09.083 --> 01:33:10.284
A GROUND WATER AGENCY THAT WAS

01:33:10.351 --> 01:33:11.252
ONE THAT WAS A COORDINATED MADE

01:33:11.319 --> 01:33:13.454
UP FOR THESE PROGRAMS OR WE

01:33:13.521 --> 01:33:14.255
COULD HAVE --

01:33:14.322 --> 01:33:16.324
DEJA VU ALL OVER AGAIN WOULD

01:33:16.390 --> 01:33:18.092
HAVING DIFFERENT FIGHTS NOW

01:33:18.159 --> 01:33:20.728
WITHIN THE GROUNDWATER AGENCY

01:33:20.795 --> 01:33:22.463
OVER -- THE

01:33:22.530 --> 01:33:25.333
ATTACHED COMMUNICATIONS BASED ON

01:33:25.399 --> 01:33:26.734
WHAT PEOPLE THINK IS THERE.

01:33:26.801 --> 01:33:28.069
ARE PRIMARY --

01:33:28.135 --> 01:33:29.403
CHALLENGE.

01:33:29.470 --> 01:33:30.504
HE CAN HELP ME OUT WITH THAT

01:33:30.571 --> 01:33:31.906
BECAUSE IT WAS BUGGING ME.

01:33:31.973 --> 01:33:33.407
ABSOLUTELY AND I THINK THAT'S AN

01:33:33.474 --> 01:33:35.443
EXCELLENT QUESTION AND I WILL DO

01:33:35.509 --> 01:33:37.511
MY BEST TO HAVE A VERY SUCCINCT

01:33:37.578 --> 01:33:40.614
ANSWER FOR YOU BUT IT IS A

01:33:40.681 --> 01:33:42.083
COMPLEX QUESTION --

01:33:42.149 --> 01:33:42.917
WITH THE WITH AN ELABORATE

01:33:42.984 --> 01:33:46.921
ANSWERS SO SAYS --

01:33:46.988 --> 01:33:49.256
AS BEST I CAN.

01:33:49.323 --> 01:33:50.858
GOING BACK TO THE ENABLING

01:33:50.925 --> 01:33:52.760
LEGISLATION GOING BACK TO THE

01:33:52.827 --> 01:33:54.228
DEVELOPMENT OF THE SUSTAINABLE

01:33:54.295 --> 01:33:56.297
GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT ACT.

01:33:56.364 --> 01:33:58.866
OF COURSE THERE WERE A LOT OF

01:33:58.933 --> 01:34:01.235
INTERESTS NOT ONLY WAS ON THE

01:34:01.302 --> 01:34:02.603
EXECUTIVE BRANCH INVOLVED THE

01:34:02.670 --> 01:34:04.105
LEGISLATIVE BRANCH WAS INVOLVED

01:34:04.171 --> 01:34:05.873
BUT LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS.

01:34:05.940 --> 01:34:08.075
AND WATER AGENCY COMMUNITIES FOR

01:34:08.142 --> 01:34:09.810
EXAMPLE.

01:34:09.877 --> 01:34:11.712
THIS IS THE MAIN TENANT OF SIGMA

01:34:11.779 --> 01:34:13.514
OF KEEPING GROUND WATER

01:34:13.581 --> 01:34:17.251
MANAGEMENT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL.

01:34:17.318 --> 01:34:19.687
IS WHERE WITH THE COMPLEXITY OF

01:34:19.754 --> 01:34:22.390
THE GEOLOGY OF THOSE BASINS.

01:34:22.456 --> 01:34:26.260
THE LOCAL AUTHORITY IS --

01:34:26.327 --> 01:34:28.262
WAS SUPPORTED BY SIGNUP BECAUSE

01:34:28.329 --> 01:34:30.464
OF THAT COMPLEXITY THE LOCALS

01:34:30.531 --> 01:34:31.599
KNOW IT BEST.

01:34:31.665 --> 01:34:34.068
BUT AS WE KNOW WATER ISSUES

01:34:34.135 --> 01:34:37.705
HISTORICALLY HAVE BEEN QUITE

01:34:37.772 --> 01:34:39.774
CONTENTIOUS AND DIVERSIFY BUT SO

01:34:39.840 --> 01:34:42.176
IN ORDER FOR THE LOCALS TO KEEP.

01:34:42.243 --> 01:34:44.812
THEIR AUTHORITY UNDER SIGMA WITH

01:34:44.879 --> 01:34:47.648
THIS MAIN POLICY SHIFT FOR

01:34:47.715 --> 01:34:49.283
COMING FROM THE STATE.

01:34:49.350 --> 01:34:50.918
THAT WE NEED TO SUSTAINABLY

01:34:50.985 --> 01:34:53.854
MANAGED THE FIVE HUNDRED FIFTEEN

01:34:53.921 --> 01:34:55.389
GROUND WATER BASINS IN THE STATE.

01:34:55.456 --> 01:34:59.093
IT IS REALLY PUT ON THE LOCALS.

01:34:59.160 --> 01:35:01.529
I IF THEY WANT TO MAINTAIN NOT

01:35:01.595 --> 01:35:03.497
AUTHORITY THEY NEED TO COME

01:35:03.564 --> 01:35:05.366
TOGETHER AND DETERMINE HOW TO

01:35:05.433 --> 01:35:06.834
GOVERN THEMSELVES.

01:35:06.901 --> 01:35:08.836
NOW UNDER SIGMA AND THROUGH THE

01:35:08.903 --> 01:35:10.604
REGULATIONS THAT THE DEPARTMENT

01:35:10.671 --> 01:35:12.239
DID PASS --

01:35:12.306 --> 01:35:16.043
IN MAY OF TWENTY SIXTEEN ARE --

01:35:16.110 --> 01:35:19.046
GUIDEPOSTS FOR A THE NEED FOR

01:35:19.113 --> 01:35:20.481
COORDINATION AGREEMENTS.

01:35:20.548 --> 01:35:22.650
AND WORKING AT THAT LOCAL LEVEL

01:35:22.716 --> 01:35:24.852
EACH PLAN DOES HAVE TO WORK WITH

01:35:24.919 --> 01:35:25.553
FEE.

01:35:25.619 --> 01:35:27.755
DECENT BASINS AND AND CONNECTING

01:35:27.822 --> 01:35:30.257
PLANS SO THERE IS A COORDINATION

01:35:30.324 --> 01:35:32.526
COMPONENT THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT

01:35:32.593 --> 01:35:34.128
TO SIGMA.

01:35:34.195 --> 01:35:36.430
IN THIS IS FOR HAVING NEW HIRES

01:35:36.497 --> 01:35:37.832
IF THEY COULD --

01:35:37.898 --> 01:35:40.167
REALLY WORK WITH THE VARIOUS

01:35:40.234 --> 01:35:42.336
AGENCIES TO HAVE ONE COORDINATED

01:35:42.403 --> 01:35:44.238
PLAN IT MAY HAVE DIFFERENT

01:35:44.305 --> 01:35:46.173
IMPLEMENTATION.

01:35:46.240 --> 01:35:49.343
DATES BASED ON WHEN THE LOCAL --

01:35:49.410 --> 01:35:51.579
PORTION OF IT IS IS --

01:35:51.645 --> 01:35:53.614
IS APPROVED BUT WOULD LIKE TO

01:35:53.681 --> 01:35:56.016
SEE RATHER THAN MAKING YOU KNOW

01:35:56.083 --> 01:35:57.218
TWELVE GAZILLION PLANS COME UP

01:35:57.284 --> 01:35:59.453
IS THAT DIFFERENT RESOURCE

01:35:59.520 --> 01:36:01.288
AGENTS YOU KNOW.

01:36:01.355 --> 01:36:02.490
THAT GAME STATE SIT DOWN BEFORE

01:36:02.556 --> 01:36:04.425
AT THE AT THE BEGINNING AND

01:36:04.492 --> 01:36:05.826
LISTS THIS IS GOING TO BE THE

01:36:05.893 --> 01:36:08.195
COORDINATOR PLAN BECAUSE YOU'RE

01:36:08.262 --> 01:36:09.997
ALL HERE ON THE SAME BASIS.

01:36:10.064 --> 01:36:10.965
I KNOW THAT'S OF

01:36:11.031 --> 01:36:13.234
OVERSIMPLIFICATION WELL AND I I

01:36:13.300 --> 01:36:14.735
I THINK IT DOES SOUND LIKE AN AN

01:36:14.802 --> 01:36:16.570
EXCELLENT IDEA --

01:36:16.637 --> 01:36:19.306
WITH THE DEPARTMENT'S ROLE IN

01:36:19.373 --> 01:36:20.174
THIS -- WE

01:36:20.241 --> 01:36:22.276
ARE REALLY SUBJECT --

01:36:22.343 --> 01:36:23.377
TO WHAT WERE THE REGULATIONS

01:36:23.444 --> 01:36:24.745
THAT WERE CREATED BY THE

01:36:24.812 --> 01:36:26.413
DEPARTMENT APPROVED BY THE

01:36:26.480 --> 01:36:27.882
CALIFORNIA WATER COMMISSION.

01:36:27.948 --> 01:36:31.886
OF COURSE IN LINE MEN WITH THE

01:36:31.952 --> 01:36:33.787
WITH THE STATUTORY REGULATIONS.

01:36:33.854 --> 01:36:35.456
THERE IS A POSSIBILITY TO HAVE

01:36:35.523 --> 01:36:36.624
MULTIPLE BROWN WATER

01:36:36.690 --> 01:36:38.025
SUSTAINABILITY AGENCIES PER

01:36:38.092 --> 01:36:40.394
BASIN AND THEY ARE ALLOWED TO DO

01:36:40.461 --> 01:36:42.963
MULTIPLE PLANS FOR THAT BASIN SO.

01:36:43.030 --> 01:36:44.365
UNLESS THERE REALLY IS A SHIFT

01:36:44.431 --> 01:36:47.001
IN THAT LEGISLATION I THINK WE

01:36:47.067 --> 01:36:48.068
ARE -- IN

01:36:48.135 --> 01:36:49.537
ORDER TO REACH WHAT YOU ARE

01:36:49.603 --> 01:36:52.740
SUGGESTING WE CAN HAVE CONTINUED

01:36:52.806 --> 01:36:54.975
SUPPORT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL

01:36:55.042 --> 01:36:56.510
THROUGH OUR REGIONAL OFFICES

01:36:56.577 --> 01:36:57.845
TRYING TO HELP.

01:36:57.912 --> 01:36:59.747
THESE ENTITIES STREAMLINED THEIR

01:36:59.813 --> 01:37:02.216
DELIVERABLES BUT AGAIN THIS IS

01:37:02.283 --> 01:37:05.419
REALLY A UPON THEM THE LOCALS TO

01:37:05.486 --> 01:37:07.388
DO THIS THEMSELVES AND ONE OF

01:37:07.454 --> 01:37:08.822
THE REASONS AGAIN WHY WERE HERE

01:37:08.889 --> 01:37:10.357
ASKING FOR ADDITIONAL POSITIONS

01:37:10.424 --> 01:37:12.393
IS THAT WE ARE LEARNING.

01:37:12.459 --> 01:37:13.961
THAT -- AN

01:37:14.028 --> 01:37:15.763
EFFORT TO HAVE SIMPLY ONE GROUND

01:37:15.829 --> 01:37:17.464
WATER SUSTAINABILITY PLAN PUT

01:37:17.531 --> 01:37:19.700
TOGETHER BY MULTIPLE GSA'S SOME

01:37:19.767 --> 01:37:20.234
OF THOSE ARE BEGINNING TO

01:37:20.301 --> 01:37:21.969
CRUMBLE IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS

01:37:22.036 --> 01:37:23.003
DESPITE.

01:37:23.070 --> 01:37:25.005
EFFORTS TO SUPPORT THEM WITH

01:37:25.072 --> 01:37:26.207
FACILITATORS FOR EXAMPLE THE

01:37:26.273 --> 01:37:27.942
DEPARTMENT IS SPENT OVER TWO AND

01:37:28.008 --> 01:37:29.510
A HALF MILLION DOLLARS.

01:37:29.577 --> 01:37:31.612
IN FACILITATION SUPPORT SERVICES

01:37:31.679 --> 01:37:32.947
IN THOSE REGIONAL AREAS IN THOSE

01:37:33.013 --> 01:37:34.615

01:41:03.524 --> 01:41:04.458
I WOULD IMAGINE ALL THESE

01:41:04.525 --> 01:41:06.427
AGENCIES HAVE A DIFFERENT LEVEL

01:41:06.493 --> 01:41:08.796

IS PROP SIXTY FUND BUT IT LOOKS

01:46:40.861 --> 01:46:43.130
LIKE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE THE

01:46:43.196 --> 01:46:45.465
SIZE OF THE CHALLENGE THAT WE

01:46:45.532 --> 01:46:46.633

01:49:33.733 --> 01:49:35.468
ROLE OF THE STATE IN ALL OF

01:49:35.535 --> 01:49:36.636
THESE CONVERSATIONS ARE HAVING

01:49:36.703 --> 01:49:40.640
WHEN THE RELATIVE DOLLAR AMOUNT

01:49:40.707 --> 01:49:41.007
THAT WE INFUSE.

01:49:41.074 --> 01:49:41.641

IS --

02:10:05.397 --> 02:10:07.232
RESULTED IN COSTLY ONGOING

02:10:07.299 --> 02:10:10.302

02:13:02.541 --> 02:13:04.076
SEAS WE START TACKLING.

ABOUT ALMOST FIFTY MILLION

02:13:17.122 --> 02:13:18.156
DOLLARS WORTH OF THE HIGHEST

02:13:18.223 --> 02:13:19.558
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS

THAT'S CLEARLY NOT GOING --

02:13:21.960 --> 02:13:22.461
TO ELIMINATE THE THE BACKLOG

02:13:22.527 --> 02:13:24.996
COMPLETELY WE WILL NEED --

02:13:25.063 --> 02:13:26.832

02:13:44.149 --> 02:13:45.617
THINK THE CHALLENGE THAT WE AVE

02:13:45.684 --> 02:13:46.752
IS THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF OLD

02:13:46.818 --> 02:13:47.919

02:13:49.688 --> 02:13:51.590
PROBABLY FOR A DECADE OR TWO AND

02:13:51.656 --> 02:13:53.225
THE LONGER WE WAIT TO BE ABLE TO

02:13:53.291 --> 02:13:53.792
GET.

02:13:53.859 --> 02:13:56.161
TO THOSE PROJECTS THAT MAY NOT

02:13:56.228 --> 02:13:57.496

02:13:57.562 --> 02:13:58.764
THE MORE IT'S GOING TO COST

02:13:58.830 --> 02:14:01.266
TAXPAYERS THAT'S WHY I I'D LOVE

02:14:01.333 --> 02:14:02.901

02:14:02.968 --> 02:14:03.635

02:14:03.702 --> 02:14:05.036
OBVIOUSLY WOULD LIKE TO BE TO

02:14:05.103 --> 02:14:07.139

TIME. TEN POSITIONS PERMANENT.

02:23:31.002 --> 02:23:33.571
AND ONE POINT SIX TWO FOUR

02:23:33.638 --> 02:23:35.006
MILLION ONGOING WHY.

02:23:35.073 --> 02:23:36.474
WE HAVE RODENTS OF UNUSUAL SIZE

02:23:36.541 --> 02:23:38.109
IN CALIFORNIA.

02:23:38.176 --> 02:23:39.978
SO THERE IS AN ANIMAL'S CALLED

02:23:40.044 --> 02:23:41.512
NUTRIA -- IT

02:23:41.579 --> 02:23:44.349
IS NATIVE TO SOUTH AMERICA IT IS

02:23:44.415 --> 02:23:46.851
NOT NATIVE TO CALIFORNIA.

02:23:46.918 --> 02:23:48.753
IT'S ABOUT THIS BIG.

02:23:48.820 --> 02:23:51.255
AND THERE DISTINCT

02:23:51.322 --> 02:23:53.257
CHARACTERISTIC IS THEY CHEW UP

02:23:53.324 --> 02:23:54.759
HABITAT.

02:23:54.826 --> 02:23:57.028
THEY BURROW --

02:23:57.095 --> 02:23:58.863
AND THE RISKS --

02:23:58.930 --> 02:24:00.465
FROM THIS --

02:24:00.531 --> 02:24:01.833
ACTIVITY ARE IMMENSE TO

02:24:01.899 --> 02:24:03.534
CALIFORNIA.

02:24:03.601 --> 02:24:05.636
WHY DOES THIS MATTER WELL WE

02:24:05.703 --> 02:24:06.671
THOUGHT THEY WEREN'T IN THE

02:24:06.738 --> 02:24:09.674
STATE ANYMORE AND BACK IN MARCH

02:24:09.741 --> 02:24:11.843
OF -- TWO

02:24:11.909 --> 02:24:12.410
THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WE GOT A

02:24:12.477 --> 02:24:14.278
REPORT AND CONFIRM THE NUTRIENT

02:24:14.345 --> 02:24:15.546
MERCED COUNTY.

02:24:15.613 --> 02:24:18.049
SINCE THEN WE FOUND THEM ALSO IN

02:24:18.116 --> 02:24:19.317
STANISLAUS COUNTY TO ALL OF ME

02:24:19.384 --> 02:24:20.918

02:24:21.919 --> 02:24:24.188
AND MARIPOSA COUNTY.

02:24:24.255 --> 02:24:25.690
THE GROWTH RATE OF THESE ANIMALS

02:24:25.757 --> 02:24:28.459
IS A STARK INCREASE FROM THE

02:24:28.526 --> 02:24:30.461
MOMENT OF DETECTION SOME OF OUR

02:24:30.528 --> 02:24:32.263
POPULATION MODEL SUGGEST WITHIN

02:24:32.330 --> 02:24:33.331
FIVE YEARS.

02:24:33.398 --> 02:24:35.299
AGO FROM A COUPLE OF ANIMALS TO

02:24:35.366 --> 02:24:36.701
ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY

02:24:36.768 --> 02:24:39.504
THOUSAND AND THEY DIG INTO

02:24:39.570 --> 02:24:41.973
LEVEES IMAGINE A LEVY COLLAPSING

02:24:42.040 --> 02:24:43.741
BECAUSE A BURROWING THEY EAT

02:24:43.808 --> 02:24:45.410
WATER INFRASTRUCTURE.

02:24:45.476 --> 02:24:47.979
AND THEY CHIU UP WETLAND HABITAT

02:24:48.046 --> 02:24:49.313
RESTORATION.

02:24:49.380 --> 02:24:50.314
THEY'RE ON THE DOORSTEP OF THE

02:24:50.381 --> 02:24:52.650
DELTA.

02:24:52.717 --> 02:24:53.951
SO IN.

02:24:54.018 --> 02:24:55.653
SPRING OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN

02:24:55.720 --> 02:24:56.187
OUR DEPARTMENT CREATED AN

02:24:56.254 --> 02:24:58.389

02:25:05.563 --> 02:25:07.065
SINCE GONE OUT AND FOUND

02:25:07.131 --> 02:25:09.033
COLLABORATIVE FUNDING.

02:25:09.100 --> 02:25:10.101
FROM THE DELTA CONSERVANCY THE

02:25:10.168 --> 02:25:12.703
DEPARTMENT OF DEPARTMENT OF

02:25:13.638 --> 02:25:16.140
MORE.

02:25:16.207 --> 02:25:17.675
THIS ISN'T A RADIC ATION PROGRAM --

02:25:17.742 --> 02:25:19.844
THIS WILL ALLOW US TO CATCH THE

02:25:19.911 --> 02:25:21.712
PROBLEM BEFORE IT COMES ON

02:25:21.779 --> 02:25:23.047
CURABLE.

02:25:23.114 --> 02:25:24.615
AND HERE IS WHERE I DON'T WANT

02:25:24.682 --> 02:25:26.317

02:25:26.384 --> 02:25:27.418
SO THIS HAPPENED IN THE

02:25:27.485 --> 02:25:29.420

02:25:54.512 --> 02:25:56.180
WHAT THEY DO EACH YEAR IS PAY

02:25:56.247 --> 02:25:58.549
TWO MILLION DOLLARS FOR BOUNTIES?

02:25:58.616 --> 02:26:00.351
JUST TO KEEP THE POPULATION AT

INTENTIONAL WAY I THINK OF OF

FRAMING THIS ISSUE WE'RE TALKING

02:28:50.321 --> 02:28:52.156
ABOUT HERE IS --

02:28:52.223 --> 02:28:54.492
REALLY BUILDING OFF OF WHAT

02:28:54.558 --> 02:28:55.693
NEEDS TO BE DONE WHICH IS A

02:28:55.760 --> 02:28:57.261
PORTFOLIO APPROACH TO BODY

02:28:57.328 --> 02:28:58.729
SUFFICIENCY IN CALIFORNIA NOT

02:28:58.796 --> 02:29:00.231
PORTFOLIO APPROACH NEED TO MOVE

02:29:00.298 --> 02:29:01.932
BEYOND KIND THE BUMPER STICKER

02:29:01.999 --> 02:29:03.301
MEANING OF PORTFOLIO INTO.

02:29:03.367 --> 02:29:05.069
WHAT'S REALLY NECESSARY TO START

02:29:05.136 --> 02:29:05.569
CHANGING THE CULTURE OF

02:29:05.636 --> 02:29:07.004
CALIFORNIA SO THAT WATER USE

02:29:07.071 --> 02:29:08.673
EFFICIENCY IS HERE TO STAY SO

02:29:08.739 --> 02:29:10.441
THAT IT'S DURABLE IT'S REAL IT

02:29:10.508 --> 02:29:12.443
DOESN'T GO AWAY WITH WITH CHANGE

02:29:12.510 --> 02:29:13.511
COULD NEVER MINISTRATIONS OR

02:29:13.577 --> 02:29:15.413
TURN OVER IN THE LEGISLATURE.

02:29:15.479 --> 02:29:15.946
BUT THAT IT REALLY BECOMES

02:29:16.013 --> 02:29:17.048
SOMETHING THAT IS --

02:29:17.114 --> 02:29:19.950
A BEDROCK OF HOW CALIFORNIA --

02:29:20.017 --> 02:29:22.219
DOES ITS BUSINESS AND AND AND

02:29:22.286 --> 02:29:23.821
AND HOW WE LIVE OUR LIVES.

02:29:23.888 --> 02:29:24.789
AND SO THERE ARE SEVERAL PIECES

02:29:24.855 --> 02:29:26.090
AND AND FROM MY PERSPECTIVE AND

02:29:26.157 --> 02:29:27.692
HOW THAT COMES TOGETHER ONE IS

02:29:27.758 --> 02:29:29.160
LOCAL ASSISTANCE GRANTS WHETHER

02:29:29.226 --> 02:29:30.394

THERE'S TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE

02:29:36.200 --> 02:29:37.268
THAT WE CAN PROVIDE AT THE STATE

02:29:37.335 --> 02:29:39.503
AND ALSO THE LOCAL LEVEL.

02:29:39.570 --> 02:29:40.338
IT'S REALLY USEFUL FOR WATER USE

02:29:40.404 --> 02:29:41.672
EFFICIENCY -

02:29:41.739 --> 02:29:43.307
THERE'S ALSO THINGS LIKE PUBLIC

02:29:43.374 --> 02:29:44.642
EDUCATION VERY IMPORTANT THAT

02:29:44.709 --> 02:29:47.078
CULTURAL ASPECT OF IMPROVING

02:29:47.144 --> 02:29:47.712

THE ARMY CORPS AND THIS PROJECT

02:36:55.439 --> 02:36:56.673

02:37:01.779 --> 02:37:02.246
WHAT'LL HAPPEN WITH THESE

02:37:02.312 --> 02:37:03.814
PROJECTS.

02:37:03.881 --> 02:37:05.282

PERIOD OF TIME.

02:37:48.158 --> 02:37:50.727
BUT THE GREATER RISK IS IF WE

02:37:50.794 --> 02:37:52.496
DON'T HAVE THIS IN PLACE THEN WE

02:37:52.563 --> 02:37:54.064

FOR FLOOD MANAGEMENT AND

02:44:53.283 --> 02:44:54.985
INVESTMENT IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY --

02:44:55.051 --> 02:44:56.219
THAT THE FIRST ITERATION THAT

02:44:56.286 --> 02:44:57.587
PLAN WAS DEVELOPED AND ADOPTED

02:44:57.654 --> 02:45:00.290
IN TWENTY TWELVE AND TWENTY

02:45:00.357 --> 02:45:00.991
SEVENTEEN THE SECOND M.

02:45:01.057 --> 02:45:03.093
ITERATION WAS DEVELOPED AND

AND THERE ARE OTHER OUR LOTS OF

02:45:06.830 --> 02:45:08.064
RECOMMENDATIONS OF LOTS AND LOTS

02:45:08.131 --> 02:45:09.532
OF IMPORTANT PIECES AS PART OF

02:45:09.599 --> 02:45:12.602
THAT PLAN --

02:45:12.669 --> 02:45:13.270
BUT A COUPLE I WANT TO POINT OUT

02:45:13.336 --> 02:45:16.206
TO YOU TODAY BECAUSE THE SYSTEM

02:45:16.273 --> 02:45:17.941
OF FLOOD PROTECTION FACILITIES

02:45:18.008 --> 02:45:19.042
THAT THE STATE IS RESPONSIBLE

02:45:19.109 --> 02:45:20.277
FOR AND THE LOCAL AGENCIES

02:45:20.343 --> 02:45:21.144
RESPONSIBLE FOR IN THE CENTRAL

02:45:21.211 --> 02:45:21.711
VALLEY.

02:45:21.778 --> 02:45:23.413
NEEDS A LOT OF HELP NEEDS TENS

02:45:23.480 --> 02:45:24.981
OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF

02:45:25.048 --> 02:45:26.750
IMPROVEMENTS OVER THE NEXT --

02:45:26.816 --> 02:45:28.718
SEVERAL DECADES --

02:45:28.785 --> 02:45:30.053
TO REALLY GET IT TO WHERE --

02:45:30.120 --> 02:45:32.055
IT NEEDS TO BE EVEN TODAY BUT

02:45:32.122 --> 02:45:33.556
CERTAINLY LOOKING AHEAD ADDED

02:45:33.623 --> 02:45:35.392
CLIMATE CHANGE ORLD WITH A SEA

02:45:35.458 --> 02:45:37.827
LEVEL RISE IMPACTS AND CHANGING

02:45:37.894 --> 02:45:40.163
IN ONE HYDROLOGY IMPACTS --

02:45:40.230 --> 02:45:41.331
THE SECOND THING I WANT TO POINT

02:45:41.398 --> 02:45:42.766
OUT THAT THAT WAS A MAJOR FOCUS

02:45:42.832 --> 02:45:45.168
AND IF AND IN PARTICULAR IS

02:45:45.235 --> 02:45:45.835
TWENTY SEVENTEEN CENTER BY FLOOD

02:45:45.902 --> 02:45:46.569
PROTECTION PLAN.

02:45:46.636 --> 02:45:48.772
DOCUMENT UPDATE WAS.

02:45:48.838 --> 02:45:50.907
THE FACT THAT AS WE DO THESE

02:45:50.974 --> 02:45:53.777
FLOOD PROJECTS WE ALSO SHOULD BE

02:45:53.843 --> 02:45:55.078
CAN BE.

02:45:55.145 --> 02:45:56.279
MUST BE.

02:45:56.346 --> 02:45:58.048
ALSO PURSUING IMPROVEMENTS TO

02:45:58.114 --> 02:46:01.217
FISH AND WILDLIFE HABITAT ALONG

02:46:01.284 --> 02:46:01.785
THE WAY.

02:46:01.851 --> 02:46:03.386
TURNS OUT THERE ARE A LOT OF

02:46:03.453 --> 02:46:04.020
JUST LIKE THERE ARE ACROSS THE

02:46:04.087 --> 02:46:04.921
STATE BUT IN BUT IN THE CENTRAL

02:46:04.988 --> 02:46:05.789
VALLEY IN PARTICULAR IT'S

02:46:05.855 --> 02:46:06.823
CERTAINLY OUR FOCUS TODAY THERE

02:46:06.890 --> 02:46:07.457
A LOT OF LEGACY IMPACTS WHETHER

02:46:07.524 --> 02:46:08.792
SOME GOLD MINING.

02:46:08.858 --> 02:46:10.860
DREDGING --

02:46:10.927 --> 02:46:13.463
LEVYING ARMS BASIC ECONOMIC

02:46:13.530 --> 02:46:14.130
DEVELOPMENT THAT'S BEEN

02:46:14.197 --> 02:46:15.365
NECESSARY OVER THE COURSE OF THE

02:46:15.432 --> 02:46:17.434
HISTORY OF CALIFORNIA AND DOES

02:46:17.500 --> 02:46:19.035
ECONOMIC ACTIONS OF BECAUSE A

02:46:19.102 --> 02:46:20.704
LOT OF DEGRADATION TO THE

02:46:20.770 --> 02:46:22.172
ECOSYSTEMS IN THE VALLEY.

02:46:22.238 --> 02:46:23.373
AND TURNS OUT THAT A LOT OF WHAT

02:46:23.440 --> 02:46:25.742
WE CAN DO FOR FLOOD MANAGEMENT

02:46:25.809 --> 02:46:27.711
IMPROVEMENT TO REDUCE RISK TO

02:46:27.777 --> 02:46:28.878
LIVES IN ECONOMY.

02:46:28.945 --> 02:46:30.213
ALSO CAN BE DONE IN A WAY THAT

02:46:30.280 --> 02:46:31.448
BENEFITS FISH AND WILDLIFE'S ARE

02:46:31.514 --> 02:46:32.716
TURNING BACK THE CLOCK IN THAT

02:46:32.782 --> 02:46:33.917
CONVERSATION.

02:46:33.983 --> 02:46:34.951
AND SO THAT'S REALLY WHAT TH TO

02:46:35.018 --> 02:46:37.187
BUDGET ITEMS THAT ARE BEFORE YOU

02:46:37.253 --> 02:46:39.189
HEAR BOTH ONE RUN NOW AND AND

02:46:39.255 --> 02:46:40.890
COMING NEXT REALLY.

02:46:40.957 --> 02:46:43.426
REALLY GET AT AND THAT IS HOW

02:46:43.493 --> 02:46:45.829
CAN WE PRIORITIZE INVESTMENT IN

02:46:45.895 --> 02:46:48.932
PROJECTS USING WHAT PROPOSITION

02:46:48.998 --> 02:46:50.633
ONE IN PROPOSITION --

02:46:50.700 --> 02:46:51.267
SIXTY EIGHT TO GET OUTCOMES THAT

02:46:51.334 --> 02:46:52.902
BOTH REDUCE THE RISK TO HUMAN

02:46:52.969 --> 02:46:55.071
LIFE.

02:46:55.138 --> 02:46:56.539
AND TO OUR ECONOMY IS ABOUT THE

02:46:56.606 --> 02:46:58.942
SAME TIME DOING THOSE PROJECTS

02:46:59.008 --> 02:46:59.576
IN WAYS THAT IMPROVE THE

02:46:59.642 --> 02:47:00.443
ENVIRONMENT --

02:47:00.510 --> 02:47:01.244
TURNS OUT THAT MORE AND MORE

02:47:01.311 --> 02:47:04.581
OPPORTUNITY ARE --

02:47:04.647 --> 02:47:05.482
ARE OUT THERE ARE BEING

02:47:05.548 --> 02:47:07.083
DEVELOPED ARE SUPPORTED BY LOCAL

02:47:07.150 --> 02:47:08.752
AGENCIES BY US BY THE FEDERAL

02:47:08.818 --> 02:47:09.519
GOVERNMENT.

02:47:09.586 --> 02:47:10.820
AND SO THAT'S REALLY WHAT USED

02:47:10.887 --> 02:47:12.021
TO BUDGET PROPOSALS ARE ALL

02:47:12.088 --> 02:47:14.157

SCALE FROM HUGE LEVY SETBACKS

02:47:21.898 --> 02:47:22.966
MORTAL MILES LONG LIKE IN THE

02:47:23.032 --> 02:47:25.769
YOLO BYPASS WHICH IS CURRENTLY

BOARD REQUIREMENTS AND RESTORING

02:53:05.274 --> 02:53:06.976
HABITAT THE PROBLEM IS THE

02:53:07.043 --> 02:53:08.211
VOLUNTARY SETTLEMENT PACKAGE

02:53:08.277 --> 02:53:09.846
THIS BEFORE YOU BEFORE THE STATE

WATER BOARD RIGHT NOW SUBMITTED.

02:53:11.547 --> 02:53:13.883
SIX DAYS AGO IS DRAMATICALLY

02:53:13.950 --> 02:53:16.652
INADEQUATE --

02:53:16.719 --> 02:53:19.722
WE'VE LOOKED AT THE REQUIREMENTS

02:53:19.789 --> 02:53:21.023
POINT DOES NOT --

02:53:21.090 --> 02:53:22.859
COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF

02:53:22.925 --> 02:53:26.696
PROP SIXTY EIGHT OF THE AS OF AS

02:53:26.763 --> 02:53:28.564
MR BONHAM OUTLINED.

02:53:28.631 --> 02:53:29.165
THAT PROPOSAL IS DESIGNED TO

02:53:29.232 --> 02:53:31.200
PROVIDE WATER AND HABITAT TO

02:53:31.267 --> 02:53:33.102
HELP RESTORE THE BAY DELTA IN A

02:53:33.169 --> 02:53:34.170
COLLABORATIVE WAY THAT'S A

02:53:34.237 --> 02:53:36.405
THAT'S A A LAUDABLE IDEA.

02:53:36.472 --> 02:53:38.141
THE PROBLEM IS MUCH OF THE

02:53:38.207 --> 02:53:39.809
HABITAT PROPOSED --

02:53:39.876 --> 02:53:41.210
IS HABITAT THAT'S ALREADY

02:53:41.277 --> 02:53:43.146
COMMITTED TO AND IN SOME CASES

02:53:43.212 --> 02:53:44.781
LITERALLY ALREADY CONSTRUCTED ON

02:53:44.847 --> 02:53:46.716
SO MUCH OF THE HABITAT PROPOSED

02:53:46.783 --> 02:53:48.384
TO BE BLUNT IS NOT REAL.

02:53:48.451 --> 02:53:49.819
ALL AND ON THE WATER SIDE.

02:53:49.886 --> 02:53:51.053
THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF

02:53:51.120 --> 02:53:53.389
RECLAMATION HAS MODELED THIS

02:53:53.456 --> 02:53:54.857
VOLUNTARY SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT

02:53:54.924 --> 02:53:56.058
AND THEIR MODELING SO THIS IS

02:53:56.125 --> 02:53:58.027
THE BUREAU'S MODELING HOW THIS

02:53:58.094 --> 02:53:59.629
VSA WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED.

02:53:59.695 --> 02:54:01.497
SHOWS THAT THIS THE THE THIS

02:54:01.564 --> 02:54:03.566
PROPOSAL WOULD NOT INCREASE

02:54:03.633 --> 02:54:04.801
PROTECTIONS IN THE BAY DELTA IT

02:54:04.867 --> 02:54:06.135
WOULD ACTUALLY DRAMATICALLY

02:54:06.202 --> 02:54:07.603
WEAKENED PROTECTIONS IN THE BAY

02:54:07.670 --> 02:54:08.771
DELTA BECAUSE THE TRUMP

02:54:08.838 --> 02:54:10.273
ADMINISTRATIONS IN THE MIDDLE OF

02:54:10.339 --> 02:54:12.041
ROLL BACKS. FOR THESE

02:54:12.108 --> 02:54:14.443
PROTECTIONS NOW UNFORTUNATELY

02:54:14.510 --> 02:54:15.845
THE VOLUNTARY SOME AGREEMENT.

02:54:15.912 --> 02:54:17.947
APPEARS NOT TO PRECLUDE THAT

02:54:18.014 --> 02:54:20.216
ROLL BACK SO IT IT ACTUALLY SETS

02:54:20.283 --> 02:54:21.884
UP THE POSSIBILITY HAT OF THAT

02:54:21.951 --> 02:54:23.586
SOME WATER AGENCIES WOULD

02:54:23.653 --> 02:54:24.620
CONTRIBUTE MORE WATER THE BAY

02:54:24.687 --> 02:54:25.321
DELTA.

02:54:25.388 --> 02:54:27.023
BUT THE BUREAU OF RECLAMATION

02:54:27.089 --> 02:54:28.491
WOULD GRAB THAT WATER AND THEN

02:54:28.558 --> 02:54:29.992
ADDITIONAL WATER.

02:54:30.059 --> 02:54:33.129
IN THE NORMAL CONDITIONS IN THE

02:54:33.196 --> 02:54:34.030
DELTA WOULD ACTUALLY WORSEN

02:54:34.096 --> 02:54:34.330
[inaudible]

02:54:34.397 --> 02:54:35.464
THAT'S NOT.

02:54:35.531 --> 02:54:37.200
ALL CONSISTENT WITH PROP SIXTY

02:54:37.266 --> 02:54:38.234
EIGHT ON AGAIN WE DO BELIEVE
