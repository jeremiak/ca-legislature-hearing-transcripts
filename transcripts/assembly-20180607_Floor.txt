CALDERON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. AND MEMBERS ACR TO FORTY SIX. I IS ABOUT WORLD OCEANS DAY AND RECOGNIZING THAT. JUNE EIGHTH OF THIS YEAR IS WORLD OCEANS DAY. OBVIOUSLY THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE TO ME FOR A LOT OF OBVIOUS REASONS BECAUSE OF MY BACKGROUND GROWING UP SURFING SPENDING. VIRTUALLY EVERY DAY IN THE OCEANS AND SALAS. SEVEN YEARS OLD. YOU KNOW I I'VE HAD EXPERIENCES IN THE OCEAN THAT HAVE MEANT SO MUCH TO ME. ARE AND THAT HAVE BEEN SUCH AN INTEGRAL PART OF MY LIFE. NOT WHEN YOU WHEN YOU'RE SURFING IN AND INNER SENDING UP ON A WAVING YOU LITERALLY HAVE A DOLPHIN RIGHT HERE. AT YOUR FEET THAT YOU CAN REACH DOWN AND JUST TOUCH WELTS ON THE SAME WAY AS AN EXPERIENCE UNLIKE ANYTHING ELSE. YOU COULD EXPERIENCE IN YOUR LIFE. BUT THERE ARE OTHER THINGS. THAT. YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN ABLE TO EXPERIENCE THAT ARE APART FROM SURFING ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WAS ABLE TO DO WHEN I WAS YOUNGER. AS MY MOTHER. SHE WOULD TAKE US OUT WHALE WATCHING ME PLAY HOOKY FROM SCHOOL. AND WE GO WHALE WATCHING EARLY IN THE MORNING. AND THE HOUSE ME IN MIGHT MIGHT TWO OF MY BROTHERS AND ME AND STEVE AND I WAS LIKE SOME OF THE BEST EXPERIENCE. EXPERIENCES OF MY LIFE BECAUSE THERE'S JUST SOMETHING THE THREE OF US GET TOGETHER YOU KNOW SO COOL TO SEE ALL THE JELLY FISH. YOU NOD YOUR DRY GOING OUT TO SEAL THE DOLPHINS AND WHEN YOU SEE A WHALE IT'S LIKE THE BEST EXPERIENCE EVER. AND THERE ARE MANY EXPERIENCES FROM MILLIONS OF PEOPLE LIKE THIS ALL OVER THE STATE. ALL OVER THE WORLD IN A LOT OF PEOPLE SITTING RIGHT HERE ON THIS FLOOR HAVE THEIR OWN SIMILAR EXPERIENCES. WHEN IT COMES TO THE OCEAN AYE BUT THE REASON WHY I'M DEALING AYE I'M DOING THIS RESOLUTION IS BECAUSE WE HAVE A PROBLEM IN OUR OCEANS ARE DYING. WE HAVE. COUPLE WHALES THAT HAVE BEEN WASHING UP ON BEACHES HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND AROUND THE WORLD THAT WE HAD A WHALE WASHED UP ON THE BEACH IN THAILAND WITH. OVER EIGHTY PLASTIC BAGS IN ITS STOMACH. TWENTY POUNDS OF PLASTIC IN ITS STOMACH WHICH BECAUSE IT'S DEATH WE HAD WHALE HERE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WHAT'S UPON THE BEACH. WITH THIRTY POUNDS OF PLASTIC. IN ITS STOMACH. WE HAVE. US THE WHOLE Y. OF THE STATE OF HAWAI JUST PASSED ACTUALLY A LAW BANNING A LOT OF THE SUN SCREENS THAT WE USE EVERY DAY. AND THE REASON WHY IS BECAUSE IT WAS FOUND THAT CERTAIN INGREDIENTS WITHIN THE SUNSCREENS ARE ACTUALLY CONTRIBUTING TO THE DEATH. CORAL REEFS REEFS ARE IN HAWAI. I. WHICH IS A HUGE PART OF THE ECOSYSTEM OF THE OCEAN. AND AND SO WE ARE HAVING ALL THESE MAJOR IMPACTS ON THE OCEAN AND. YOU KNOW IT'S KIND OF PASSING AS BLIND WE'RE NOT TAKEN A MOMENT TO TO THINK ABOUT THE IMPACT THAT WE'RE HAVING. WE ALL LOVE OUR CONVENIENCE AS WE ALL LOVE OF BEING ABLE TO YOU KNOW USE A PLASTIC STRAW ARE A PLASTIC CUP AND IT'S FINE IF WE WANT TO USE IT BUT WE HAVE TO BE. RESPONSIBLE WITH HOW WE DISCARD WITH THAT. WITH THOSE PRODUCTS AND BE MORE COGNIZANT OF THE IMPACT THAT WERE HAVING ON THE OCEAN BECAUSE. THE MAJORITY OF THE WORLD GETS ITS FOOD FROM THE OCEAN AND WHEN THESE FISH ARE EATING CLASSIC WE'RE EATING THE FISH AND WE'RE IN THE PLASTIC AND WE'RE REALLY NOT QUITE SURE ABOUT WHAT IMPACT THAT'S HAVING. ON US AND SO I WANTED TO. DO THIS THIS RESOLUTION TO RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF WORLD OCEANS DAY I MEAN AND IT'S NOT JUST THE HEALTH OF THE OCEAN WE HAVE ECONOMIES. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA LOCAL ECONOMIES OUR STATE ECONOMY THEIR ECONOMIES AROUND THE WORLD THAT DEPEND ON THE HEALTH. pIMPORTANT WE TAKE THE TIME TO RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE OCEAN NOT JUST OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT TO THE WORLD AND THE IMPACT IT HAS ON OUR LIVES.
