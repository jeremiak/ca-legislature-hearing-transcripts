STATE.

00:16:56.548 --> 00:16:58.083
CALIFORNIA HAS THE HIGHEST

00:16:58.150 --> 00:16:59.752
POVERTY RATE IN THE NATION.

00:16:59.818 --> 00:17:01.186
RECENT COMPREHENSIVE STUDIES

00:17:01.253 --> 00:17:02.688
SUCH AS THE REPORT BY THE

OUT OF POVERTY TASK FORCE AND

00:17:06.058 --> 00:17:22.241
THE NATIONAL

00:18:32.411 --> 00:18:33.078
STATE LIFTING

00:18:33.145 --> 00:18:34.379
CHILDREN AND FAMILIES OUT OF

00:18:34.446 --> 00:18:37.115
POVERTY TASK FORCE -- THIS BILL

00:18:37.182 --> 00:18:38.484
IS IS CRUCIAL THEIR OF

00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:40.285
ESSENTIALLY BEEN TWO REASONS

00:18:40.352 --> 00:18:41.920
THAT THE STATE IS NOT MADE.

00:18:41.987 --> 00:18:43.455
PROGRESS IN PAST YEARS IT

00:18:43.522 --> 00:18:45.023
ACTUALLY REDUCING.

00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:46.225
THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN AND

00:18:46.291 --> 00:18:48.794
FAMILIES IN POVERTY IN THE FORD

00:18:48.861 --> 00:18:50.562
AND FIFTY THOUSAND CHILDREN.

00:18:50.629 --> 00:18:52.231
IN DEEP POVERTY IN THE STATE

00:18:52.297 --> 00:18:54.032
LEGISLATURES DONE A TERRIFIC JOB

00:18:54.099 --> 00:18:55.934
IN MAINTAINING THE SAFETY NET

00:18:56.001 --> 00:18:57.336
AND FIGHTING TO EXPAND IT.

00:18:57.402 --> 00:18:59.605
BUT THE NUMBER AND PERCENTAGE OF

00:18:59.671 --> 00:19:01.940
CHILDREN IN POVERTY HAS GONE UP

00:19:02.007 --> 00:19:03.675
AND DOWN A BIT WITH THE ECONOMY

00:19:03.742 --> 00:19:06.078
BUT NEVER REALLY BEEN REDUCED

00:19:06.144 --> 00:19:07.446
THEIR TWO REASONS FOR THAT.

00:19:07.513 --> 00:19:09.882
THE FIRST IS THERE IS NOT BEEN A

00:19:09.948 --> 00:19:13.285
COMPREHENSIVE EVIDENCE BASED

00:19:13.352 --> 00:19:16.121
PLAN DATABASE PLAN. TO DID

00:19:16.188 --> 00:19:19.091
PROVIDE A ROAD MAP. TO ELIMINATE

00:19:19.157 --> 00:19:20.659
THE CHILD POVERTY IN REDUCE

00:19:20.726 --> 00:19:22.427
OVERALL CHILD POVERTY BY AT

00:19:22.494 --> 00:19:24.329
LEAST 50%.

00:19:24.396 --> 00:19:26.331
THAT IS NOW THEN PROVIDED A BY

00:19:26.398 --> 00:19:28.233
THE TASK FORCE AND THE PRIORITY

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:29.902
BILLS OF ALL BEEN INTRODUCED AS

00:19:29.968 --> 00:19:31.436
LEGISLATION.

00:19:31.503 --> 00:19:34.806
BUT THE SECOND CRITICAL POINT IS

00:19:34.873 --> 00:19:37.009
THERE NEEDS TO BE A STATED STATE

00:19:37.075 --> 00:19:38.010
GOAL.

00:19:38.076 --> 00:19:40.212
AND THEN REGULAR MEASUREMENTS

00:19:40.279 --> 00:19:42.047
THE TRACK THE PROGRESS TOWARDS

00:19:42.114 --> 00:19:43.282
MEETING THE CALL.

00:19:43.348 --> 00:19:45.117
SO THAT THIS COMMITTEE IN THE

00:19:45.183 --> 00:19:47.085
LEGISLATURE CAN MAKE JUDGMENTS

00:19:47.152 --> 00:19:49.354
ABOUT WHAT ELSE PERHAPS NEEDS TO

00:19:49.421 --> 00:19:51.223
BE DONE WHAT CHANGES NEED TO BE

00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:53.692
MADE IN ORDER TO MEET THAT GOAL.

00:19:53.759 --> 00:19:55.894
SO THE CRITICAL PIECE IN TERMS

00:19:55.961 --> 00:19:57.629
OF ACTUALLY REDUCING CHILD AND

00:19:57.696 --> 00:20:00.332
FAMILY POVERTY IN THE STATE.

00:20:00.399 --> 00:20:02.067
IS NOT JUST IMPLEMENTATION OF

00:20:02.134 --> 00:20:05.270
THE TASK FORCE RECOMMENDATIONS

00:20:05.337 --> 00:20:06.371

SO THAT YOU CAN TRACK PROGRESS

00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:16.415

00:46:14.004 --> 00:46:16.406
SIR SB THREE THREE SEVEN DEALS

00:46:16.473 --> 00:46:18.075
WITH THE FACT THAT IN -- THERE'S

00:46:18.142 --> 00:46:19.576
A FEDERAL LAW.

00:46:19.643 --> 00:46:22.179
THAT SAYS IF YOU ARE A FAMILY

00:46:22.246 --> 00:46:24.281
THAT RECEIVES BENEFITS FOR

00:46:24.348 --> 00:46:27.417
EXAMPLE -- WE ASK FOR

00:46:27.484 --> 00:46:29.086
CALIBRATION THAT.

00:46:29.153 --> 00:46:31.588
IF THERE IS A NON CUSTODIAL

00:46:31.655 --> 00:46:33.657
PARENT PAYING CHILD SUPPORT

00:46:33.724 --> 00:46:34.791
BENEFITS.

00:46:34.858 --> 00:46:36.593
YOU THE FAMILY THAT IS THE

00:46:36.660 --> 00:46:39.596
CUSTODIAL PARENT ONLY RECEIVES

00:46:39.663 --> 00:46:41.298
FIFTY DOLLARS OF THE PAYMENT OF

00:46:41.365 --> 00:46:42.599
THAT CHILD SUPPORT.

00:46:42.666 --> 00:46:45.035
AND THE REMAINING CHILD SUPPORT

00:46:45.102 --> 00:46:49.740
PAYMENTS GOES TO THE GOVERNMENT.

00:46:49.806 --> 00:46:51.675
TO COVER THESE BENEFITS.

00:46:51.742 --> 00:46:52.943
AND OF COURSE IF THE

00:46:53.010 --> 00:46:55.612
NONCUSTODIAL PARENT.

00:46:55.679 --> 00:46:56.947
CANNOT AFFORD TO MAKE THOSE

00:46:57.014 --> 00:46:59.983
PAYMENTS THEN FINES INTERESTING

00:47:00.050 --> 00:47:01.919
CREW AND EVEN TO THE POINT WHERE

00:47:01.985 --> 00:47:04.121
IT BECOMES A CRIME IS PUNISHABLE

00:47:04.188 --> 00:47:05.088
BY RIME.

00:47:05.155 --> 00:47:08.125
SO WHAT SB THREE THREE SEVEN

00:47:08.192 --> 00:47:08.859
DOES IS TWO THINGS.

00:47:08.926 --> 00:47:11.028
ONE IT.

00:47:11.094 --> 00:47:12.262
BENEFITS THE CHILDREN BY SAYING

00:47:12.329 --> 00:47:15.132
LOOK IF THE NONCUSTODIAL PARENT

00:47:15.199 --> 00:47:16.733
HAS THE ABILITY TO PAY.

00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:18.101
THEN THAT PAYMENT SHOULD GO

00:47:18.168 --> 00:47:20.771
DIRECTLY TO THE FAMILY AND TO

00:47:20.837 --> 00:47:22.706
COVER THE COSTS OF THE CHILDREN.

00:47:22.773 --> 00:47:24.808
SO THE FAMILY CAN RECEIVE MORE

00:47:24.875 --> 00:47:26.410
THAN FIFTY DOLLARS.

00:47:26.476 --> 00:47:29.313
AND IF THAT CUSTODIAL PARENT.

00:47:29.379 --> 00:47:30.881
NON CUSTODIAL SKEWS ME GETS IN

00:47:30.948 --> 00:47:31.949
ARREARS.

00:47:32.015 --> 00:47:35.185
THAT IT IS NO LONGER A CRIMINAL

00:47:35.252 --> 00:47:35.419
FACTOR.

00:47:35.485 --> 00:47:38.689
BUT WE CAN PURSUE AS WE DO

00:47:38.755 --> 00:47:41.658
WONDER ARE THERE'S LOTS OF OTHER

00:47:41.725 --> 00:47:43.627
STATUTES IN CALIFORNIA LAW. TO

00:47:43.694 --> 00:47:46.797
TRY TO HELP COLLECT THAT --

00:47:46.863 --> 00:47:48.732
ARREARS CHILD SUPPORT.

00:47:48.799 --> 00:47:50.200
BUT THAT DIDN'T GET.

00:47:50.267 --> 00:47:53.770
THAT MAY BE THAT MAY HAVE ARISEN.

00:47:53.837 --> 00:47:57.007
DUE TO THE THIS FEDERAL LAW CAN

00:47:57.074 --> 00:47:58.642
BE THE STATE CAN EXPANSION.

00:47:58.709 --> 00:47:59.876
SO THEN.

00:47:59.943 --> 00:48:02.613
THERE IS -- DE.

00:48:02.679 --> 00:48:05.115
NON CUSTODIAL PARENT IF THEY ARE

00:48:05.182 --> 00:48:07.684

00:50:45.642 --> 00:50:47.644
LAST YEAR CALIFORNIA COLLECTED.

00:50:47.711 --> 00:50:48.378
FOUR HUNDRED AND TEN MILLION

00:50:48.445 --> 00:50:50.180
DOLLARS ON BEHALF OF CHILDREN

00:50:50.247 --> 00:50:52.015
WHO RECEIVED CAL WORKS THE

00:50:52.082 --> 00:50:53.917
POOREST CHILDREN IN OUR STATE.

00:50:53.984 --> 00:50:54.951
ONLY A FRACTION OF THOSE

00:50:55.018 --> 00:50:56.253
PAYMENTS ACTUALLY WENT THROUGH

00:50:56.319 --> 00:50:59.122
THE CHILDREN. 90% SIX HUNDRED

00:50:59.189 --> 00:51:00.424
AND THIRTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS

00:51:00.490 --> 00:51:02.426
WERE REDIRECTED TO REPAY THE

00:51:02.492 --> 00:51:04.428
COST OF PUBLIC ASSISTANCE.

00:51:04.494 --> 00:51:06.163
THESE POLICIES TAKE VALUABLE

00:51:06.229 --> 00:51:07.597
RESOURCES FROM LOW INCOME

00:51:07.664 --> 00:51:08.598
CHILDREN.

00:51:08.665 --> 00:51:09.966
DISPROPORTIONATELY HARM CHILDREN

00:51:10.033 --> 00:51:12.302
OF COLOR AND SET UP LOW INCOME

00:51:12.369 --> 00:51:13.437
PARENTS TO FAIL.

00:51:13.503 --> 00:51:14.671
WE'VE HEARD FROM COUNTLESS

00:51:14.738 --> 00:51:16.907
FAMILIES BUT THE SYSTEM DRIVES

00:51:16.973 --> 00:51:17.974
PARENTS TO WORK IN THE

00:51:18.041 --> 00:51:19.776
UNDERGROUND ECONOMY SO THEY CAN

00:51:19.843 --> 00:51:21.545
SEND THEIR EARNINGS DUE TO THEIR

00:51:21.611 --> 00:51:22.446
FAMILY.

00:51:22.512 --> 00:51:23.747
IT CREATES CONFLICT BETWEEN

00:51:23.814 --> 00:51:25.315
PARENTS BECAUSE THE CUSTODIAL

00:51:25.382 --> 00:51:27.050
PARENT OFTEN DOESN'T KNOW HOW

00:51:27.117 --> 00:51:28.618
MUCH THE NONCUSTODIAL PARENT IS

00:51:28.685 --> 00:51:29.953
ACTUALLY PAYING ON THEIR CHILD'S

00:51:30.020 --> 00:51:31.488
BEHALF.

00:51:31.555 --> 00:51:32.989

PAYMENTS WENT UP. 63%.

00:51:46.636 --> 00:51:48.038
PARENTS PAID NOT MORE BECAUSE

THEY KNEW THAT THE MONEY WAS

00:51:49.372 --> 00:51:51.107

JOYFUL PLEASURE OF TRYING TO

COLLECT CHILD SUPPORT ON BEHALF

00:54:35.338 --> 00:54:37.007
OF CLIENTS I HAD.

00:54:37.073 --> 00:54:40.010
THIS WAS BEFORE WE EVEN HANDED

00:54:40.076 --> 00:54:42.145
THIS OVER TO THE DA'S OFFICE AND

00:54:42.212 --> 00:54:43.313
THEN WE TOOK IT AWAY FROM THE

00:54:43.380 --> 00:54:45.081
DA'S AND CREATED A SEPARATE

00:54:45.148 --> 00:54:46.383
DIVISION OF CHILD SUPPORT

00:54:46.449 --> 00:54:47.517
ENFORCEMENT.

00:54:47.584 --> 00:54:49.252
BECAUSE COLLECTING CHILD SUPPORT

00:54:49.319 --> 00:54:51.688
HAS ALWAYS BEEN AN ENORMOUS

00:54:51.755 --> 00:54:52.522
CHALLENGE.

00:54:52.589 --> 00:54:54.824
SADLY SADLY PARENTS.

00:54:54.891 --> 00:54:56.593
SHOULD UNDERSTAND AND TAKE

00:54:56.660 --> 00:54:59.062
RESPONSIBILITY FOR SUPPORTING

00:54:59.129 --> 00:55:01.297
THEIR CHILDREN -- PART OF THE

00:55:01.364 --> 00:55:03.099
PROBLEM JUST TO TO SORT OF GIVE

00:55:03.166 --> 00:55:05.135
SOME CONTEXT TO MY GOOD

00:55:05.201 --> 00:55:06.803
COLLEAGUE FROM TEMECULA.

00:55:06.870 --> 00:55:09.305
WAS THAT IN THE IN THE PAST THE

00:55:09.372 --> 00:55:11.007
NOTION THAT PEOPLE WERE ACTUALLY

00:55:11.074 --> 00:55:13.109
HAD THE AUDACITY TO COLLECT

00:55:13.176 --> 00:55:14.844
WELFARE.

00:55:14.911 --> 00:55:16.546
IT WAS SUGGESTED THAT THE

00:55:16.613 --> 00:55:18.648
WELFARE SYSTEM HAD TO BE

00:55:18.715 --> 00:55:20.283
REIMBURSED.

00:55:20.350 --> 00:55:21.885
AND SO THAT MONEY INSTEAD OF

00:55:21.951 --> 00:55:23.820
GOING TO THESE CHILDREN HAD TO

00:55:23.887 --> 00:55:25.889
GO BACK TO THE STATE. FOR THESE

00:55:25.955 --> 00:55:28.625
PROGRAMS -- AT LEAST THAT WAS

00:55:28.692 --> 00:55:32.062
THE POLICY BACK THEN -- LEVEL OF

00:55:32.128 --> 00:55:33.763
POVERTY THAT YOUNG CHILDREN OR

00:55:33.830 --> 00:55:35.732
AND OR THE CHILDREN EXPERIENCE

00:55:35.799 --> 00:55:38.768
TODAY IS SO APPALLING.

00:55:38.835 --> 00:55:42.272
OF THAT -- THERE'S QUESTION NO

00:55:42.338 --> 00:55:43.506
QUESTION THAT WE NEED TO BE

00:55:43.573 --> 00:55:46.976
DOING THIS MY ONLY CONCERN NOW --

00:55:47.043 --> 00:55:48.778
WILL TWO THINGS ONE IS THE

00:55:48.845 --> 00:55:50.847
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAMMERED THE

00:55:50.914 --> 00:55:53.283
STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR YEARS

00:55:53.349 --> 00:55:55.518
BECAUSE WE WERE NOT OBTAINING

00:55:55.585 --> 00:55:58.021
THE CHILD SUPPORT COLLECTION

00:55:58.088 --> 00:55:59.489
RATES THAT WE WERE SUPPOSED.

00:55:59.556 --> 00:56:02.325
TO SO WE PAID ENORMOUS PENALTIES

00:56:02.392 --> 00:56:03.493
TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN THE

00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:05.562
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

00:56:05.628 --> 00:56:06.563
ANNUALLY.

00:56:06.629 --> 00:56:07.697
BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE AN

00:56:07.764 --> 00:56:08.865
AFFECTED CHILD SUPPORT

00:56:08.932 --> 00:56:10.500
COLLECTION SYSTEM SO THE MONEY

00:56:10.567 --> 00:56:12.635
COULD GO BACK. TO THE PUBLIC

00:56:12.702 --> 00:56:16.906
FISKE -- WE THEN I THINK AFTER A

00:56:16.973 --> 00:56:19.008
LOT OF HARD WORK FIX THE HAVE

00:56:19.075 --> 00:56:21.377
PROBLEM -- I'M APPALLED FRANKLY

00:56:21.444 --> 00:56:23.213
THAT WE STILL NOT GIVING THE THE

00:56:23.279 --> 00:56:24.614
MONEY DIRECTLY TO THE CHILDREN

00:56:24.681 --> 00:56:25.582
SO I SHARE THAT WITH CENTER

00:56:25.648 --> 00:56:26.916
STONE BUT THAT WAS THE ARGUMENT

00:56:26.983 --> 00:56:28.051
IS THAT.

00:56:28.118 --> 00:56:29.919
IF THE TAXPAYER HAS TO BE PAYING

00:56:29.986 --> 00:56:30.720
FOR THESE CHILDREN BECAUSE A

00:56:30.787 --> 00:56:32.055
PARENT WON'T THAT WE'RE GOING TO

00:56:32.122 --> 00:56:33.289
TAKE THE MONEY THAT WE GET FROM

00:56:33.356 --> 00:56:35.058
THE PARENTS AND REIMBURSE THE

00:56:35.125 --> 00:56:38.394
STATE FOR IT AND THE CHILDREN

00:56:38.461 --> 00:56:38.962
OBVIOUSLY WITH THE ONES WHO

00:56:39.028 --> 00:56:39.929
SUFFERED.

00:56:39.996 --> 00:56:41.264
THE BUT THERE'S STILL A

00:56:41.331 --> 00:56:43.767
CHALLENGE TODAY AND I WONDERED

00:56:43.833 --> 00:56:45.468
WHAT TWO THINGS ONE IS THAT AS

00:56:45.535 --> 00:56:47.003
FAR AS FEDERAL LAWS CONCERN

00:56:47.070 --> 00:56:48.338
BECAUSE WE DON'T COMPLY WITH

00:56:48.404 --> 00:56:50.940
FEDERAL LAW WE GET HAMMERED --

00:56:51.007 --> 00:56:53.209
AND I'D RATHER SEE THAT MONEY

00:56:53.276 --> 00:56:56.246
GOING TO OUR TO OUR KIDS -- THE

00:56:56.312 --> 00:56:58.281
SECOND CONCERN I HAVE AND I

00:56:58.348 --> 00:56:59.516
UNDERSTAND THAT IF YOU MAKE

00:56:59.582 --> 00:57:01.785
CHILD SUPPORT SO ONEROUS YOU

00:57:01.851 --> 00:57:04.087
WON'T GET THE NON CUSTODIAL

00:57:04.154 --> 00:57:05.255
PARENT TO PAY IT.

00:57:05.321 --> 00:57:08.291
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND.

00:57:08.358 --> 00:57:09.325
I DON'T WANT TO GIVE NON

00:57:09.392 --> 00:57:11.194
CUSTODIAL PARENTS EXCUSES NOT TO

00:57:11.261 --> 00:57:12.862
PAY THEIR RESPONSIBILITY TO

00:57:12.929 --> 00:57:14.264
THEIR CHILDREN.

00:57:14.330 --> 00:57:16.499
SO I'M WONDERING IF YOU CAN AND

00:57:16.566 --> 00:57:18.134
THAT'S A BALANCE IF YOU CAN

00:57:18.201 --> 00:57:19.636
RESPOND BECAUSE I'M SURE YOU

00:57:19.702 --> 00:57:21.738
FEEL THE SAME WAY HOW DO WE MAKE

00:57:21.805 --> 00:57:22.739
SURE.

00:57:22.806 --> 00:57:24.107
AND AND I WOULD SUBMIT TO YOU

00:57:24.174 --> 00:57:26.109
BECAUSE I SAW THIS HAPPEN IN IN

00:57:26.176 --> 00:57:29.546
MY PRACTICE -- YEARS AGO -- THAT

00:57:29.612 --> 00:57:31.948
THERE ARE NON CUSTODIAL PARENTS

00:57:32.015 --> 00:57:32.949
WHO JUST AREN'T GOING TO PAY.

00:57:33.016 --> 00:57:34.717
THEY DON'T WANNA.

00:57:34.784 --> 00:57:36.019
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO DO IT AND

00:57:36.085 --> 00:57:37.353
SO THEY GO TO THE UNDERGROUND

00:57:37.420 --> 00:57:38.655
ECONOMY THEY DO ALL THEIR

00:57:38.721 --> 00:57:41.591
BUSINESS AND CASH THEY DON'T.

00:57:41.658 --> 00:57:44.761
HAVE ANY DESIRE A SADLY TO

00:57:44.828 --> 00:57:46.663
SUPPORT THEIR CHILDREN.

00:57:46.729 --> 00:57:48.565
THERE'S NOTHING THAT RANKLES ME

00:57:48.631 --> 00:57:51.000
MORE THAN THAT SO I'M WONDERING

00:57:51.067 --> 00:57:53.870
WHAT HOW YOU AND I'M SURE THAT

00:57:53.937 --> 00:57:56.573
RANKLES YOU TOO BECAUSE PEOPLE

00:57:56.639 --> 00:57:59.075
NEED TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY --

00:57:59.142 --> 00:58:02.378
HOW DOES THIS BILL ADDRESS THAT

00:58:02.445 --> 00:58:05.682
CHALLENGE?

00:58:05.748 --> 00:58:08.218
OUR MANAGER MAY I ANSWER.

00:58:08.284 --> 00:58:11.187
THROUGH THE CHAIR [inaudible]

00:58:11.254 --> 00:58:16.793
PLEASE -- THE BILL DOES NOT.

00:58:16.860 --> 00:58:18.494
LET OFF THE HOOK THE NON

00:58:18.561 --> 00:58:20.263
CUSTODIAL PARENT.

00:58:20.330 --> 00:58:22.432
BUT WHAT IT DOES IS [inaudible]

00:58:22.498 --> 00:58:25.802
SO THE SO.

00:58:25.869 --> 00:58:28.271
DE CUSTODIAL PARENT CAN STILL

00:58:28.338 --> 00:58:29.839
PURSUE THE COLLECTION TO THE NON

00:58:29.906 --> 00:58:31.574
CUSTODIAL.

00:58:31.641 --> 00:58:33.643
WHAT IT DOES IS JUST GUARANTEE

00:58:33.710 --> 00:58:36.346
THAT WHAT EVER THE NON CUSTODIAL

00:58:36.412 --> 00:58:38.948
PARENT PAYS GOES TO THE CHILDREN?

00:58:39.015 --> 00:58:40.850
WHICH IS THE ABSURDITY OF OUR

00:58:40.917 --> 00:58:42.485
CURRENT SYSTEM IN THAT WE'RE

00:58:42.552 --> 00:58:43.953
SPENDING A LOT OF MONEY WE THE

00:58:44.020 --> 00:58:46.456
STATE TO GO AFTER AND COLLECT.

00:58:46.522 --> 00:58:47.757
BUT THEN WHATEVER IT IS WE DO

00:58:47.824 --> 00:58:48.758
COLLECT DOESN'T EVEN GO TO THE

00:58:48.825 --> 00:58:50.827
CHILDREN.

00:58:50.894 --> 00:58:54.297
AND THE THE REASON WE WERE BEING

00:58:54.364 --> 00:58:55.832
PENALIZED THE STATE OF

00:58:55.899 --> 00:58:57.533
CALIFORNIA BY THE FEDS IS

00:58:57.600 --> 00:58:59.936
BECAUSE WE WERE WE HAD NOT

00:59:00.003 --> 00:59:01.871
DISCHARGED THAT DEBT UNDER THE

00:59:01.938 --> 00:59:04.073
LAW WE WERE ALLOWED TO DISCHARGE

00:59:04.140 --> 00:59:05.875
THE DEBT BUT WE DIDN'T AND SO

00:59:05.942 --> 00:59:08.244
INSTEAD WE SHOWED IT DEBT.

00:59:08.311 --> 00:59:11.414
AND THEN WE HAD -- LOW LOW

00:59:11.481 --> 00:59:12.749
RECOVERY OF IT.

00:59:12.815 --> 00:59:15.251
WHICH UNFORTUNATELY LOW RECOVERY

00:59:15.318 --> 00:59:17.687
IS NOT UNUSUAL BECAUSE YOU'RE

00:59:17.754 --> 00:59:19.155
TALKING ABOUT.

00:59:19.222 --> 00:59:20.690
BY AND LARGE PEOPLE THAT EVEN

00:59:20.757 --> 00:59:23.726
THE NON CUSTODIAL PARENT IS NOT

00:59:23.793 --> 00:59:24.560
NECESSARILY HIGH INCOME.

00:59:24.627 --> 00:59:27.363
BUT CERTAINLY THERE'S EVIDENCE

00:59:27.430 --> 00:59:29.065
AS WAS INDICATED THROUGH THE

00:59:29.132 --> 00:59:31.668
EXPERIENCE OF COLORADO THAT ONCE

00:59:31.734 --> 00:59:34.203
THE PARENT UNDERSTANDS THAT

00:59:34.270 --> 00:59:36.139
THEIR ACTIONS THEIR MONEY IS

00:59:36.205 --> 00:59:37.974
ACTUALLY GOING TO THE CHILDREN.

00:59:38.041 --> 00:59:40.543
THEY'RE MORE WILLING TO PAY AND

00:59:40.610 --> 00:59:42.512
MORE PAYMENT HE ACTUALLY COMES

00:59:42.578 --> 00:59:44.380
TO THE CHILDREN SO THAT'S OUR

00:59:44.447 --> 00:59:49.552
HOPE -- AND YES WE WOULD STILL.

00:59:49.619 --> 00:59:51.554
WE WOULD STILL ALLOW EVERY LEGAL

00:59:51.621 --> 00:59:55.525
RIGHT FOR THE FAMILY THE THE

00:59:55.591 --> 00:59:57.961
CUSTODIAL PARENT TO READ.

00:59:58.027 --> 01:00:00.096
TO RECOVER ANY OF THAT PAYMENT

01:00:00.163 --> 01:00:02.432
THAT STILL OWED TO THEM.

01:00:02.498 --> 01:00:04.600
OKAY I JUST -- JUST NOTE THAT

01:00:04.667 --> 01:00:07.303
AGAIN IT DOESN'T RESOLVE THE

01:00:07.370 --> 01:00:08.705
ENTIRE ISSUE.

01:00:08.771 --> 01:00:10.006

01:11:28.017 --> 01:11:29.418
OF THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES THAT

01:11:37.326 --> 01:11:38.727
CENTERS.

AND THE COLORS PROGRAM IS JUST

01:11:40.329 --> 01:11:41.530
ONE OF THE TOOLS THAT THIS THAT

01:11:41.597 --> 01:11:42.931

FAMILIES TO SAVE RESOURCES AND

01:11:49.905 --> 01:11:51.807
GROW THEIR FINANCIAL STABILITY

01:11:51.874 --> 01:11:54.343

01:11:54.410 --> 01:11:57.046
TOWARD SELF SUFFICIENCY --

01:11:57.112 --> 01:11:58.213
CURRENTLY THE COLOR EXTRA

01:11:58.280 --> 01:11:59.748
PROGRAM BASICALLY REQUIRES A

01:11:59.815 --> 01:12:02.017
FAMILY TO HAVE HIT ABSOLUTE ROCK

01:12:02.084 --> 01:12:03.118

MODEST.

01:12:06.188 --> 01:12:07.923
AMOUNTS OF AID AND FOOD BANKS

01:12:07.990 --> 01:12:09.491
ARE PART OF THE SAFETY NET THAT

01:12:09.558 --> 01:12:11.527
STOPS IN WHEN PEOPLE REALLY

01:12:11.593 --> 01:12:13.262
DON'T HAVE OTHER OPTIONS -- AND

01:12:13.328 --> 01:12:14.229
WHEN GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS THAT

ARE MEANT TO KICK IN IN THESE

01:12:16.398 --> 01:12:17.599
TIMES I HAVE FAILED THEM.

01:12:17.666 --> 01:12:19.134
I'M SO THE IDEA THAT FAMILIES

01:12:19.201 --> 01:12:20.469
ALREADY LIVING ON THE EDGE OF

01:12:20.536 --> 01:12:22.071

01:12:25.808 --> 01:12:27.276

CHANGE THAT LAW WITH THE SUPPORT

01:20:07.169 --> 01:20:08.703
OF THE REPUBLICAN CAUCUS AND A

01:20:08.770 --> 01:20:10.105
COUPLE OF BUDGETS AGO WHERE WE

01:20:10.172 --> 01:20:11.740
IT USED TO BE THAT THE VALUE OF

01:20:11.806 --> 01:20:12.607

01:20:22.551 --> 01:20:23.351
OKAY.

01:20:23.418 --> 01:20:26.421

01:20:31.326 --> 01:20:32.294
AGREE WITH WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO

01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:33.328
DO -- I DON'T THINK PEOPLE

01:20:33.395 --> 01:20:34.763
SHOULD BE DISCOURAGED FROM FROM

01:20:34.829 --> 01:20:36.598
SAVINGS AND TRYING TO LIFT

01:20:36.665 --> 01:20:39.968
THEMSELVES OUT OF A POVERTY -- I

01:20:40.035 --> 01:20:41.436
THINK THIS FORCES PEOPLE TO TO

01:20:41.503 --> 01:20:43.238
LIVE ON THE EDGE WHICH I THINK

01:20:43.305 --> 01:20:48.109
IS WRONG -- BUT AM I SAYING THIS

01:20:48.176 --> 01:20:49.578
IS GOING TO BE PREVALENT AMONG

01:20:49.644 --> 01:20:51.613
THIS POPULATION BUT YOU KNOW

01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:53.315
WHAT IF SOMEBODY COMES INTO AN

01:20:53.381 --> 01:20:55.183
INHERITANCE WE ARE IF I MENTION

SUMMIT IT A FIFTY THOUSAND

01:20:59.454 --> 01:21:00.188
DOLLAR SHOULD THERE NOT BE SOME

01:21:00.255 --> 01:21:01.423

HAVE TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS

01:21:06.728 --> 01:21:11.099
CASH ON HAND -- SO THAT.

01:21:11.166 --> 01:21:11.733
WE DON'T HAVE ANYBODY GAMING THE

01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:13.802
SYSTEM.

01:21:13.868 --> 01:21:15.470

OBSCENE THEY'RE GONNA THE

01:22:28.410 --> 01:22:30.011
INTEREST ON THAT IS PROBABLY

01:22:30.078 --> 01:22:31.713
GOING TO DISQUALIFY THEM.

01:22:31.780 --> 01:22:34.082

01:22:36.651 --> 01:22:38.353
BEEN NICK'S RAMPS AND OTHER

01:22:38.420 --> 01:22:40.255

01:22:41.456 --> 01:22:42.924
ON BECAUSE FORTUNATELY EVEN.

01:22:42.991 --> 01:22:44.492
CALIFORNIA WE LIKE TO THINK OF

01:22:44.559 --> 01:22:46.594
OURSELVES ON THE CUTTING EDGE OF

01:22:46.661 --> 01:22:48.330
A LOT OF ISSUES BUT I'VE LEARNED

01:22:48.396 --> 01:22:49.664
SINCE COMING UP HERE THAT THERE

01:22:49.731 --> 01:22:50.765

SOME RED STATES -- AND THIS IS

01:22:54.969 --> 01:22:56.338
ONE OF THEM AND SO FORTUNATELY

01:22:56.404 --> 01:22:58.173
WE DON'T HAVE TO BE THE TEST

01:22:58.239 --> 01:22:59.240
CASE WE KNOW HOW IT'S WORKED

01:22:59.307 --> 01:23:07.315
OTHER STATES AND I DON'T THINK

01:23:07.382 --> 01:23:08.783
THAT'S BEEN AN ISSUE.

01:23:08.850 --> 01:23:09.718
I WOULD JUST SAID THAT THE

01:23:09.784 --> 01:23:10.452

01:24:36.137 --> 01:24:37.772
OF NAY CROSS THE LINE TO THE

01:24:37.839 --> 01:24:40.475
MONEY SIDE BUT IT IS SO HOW MANY --

GET I GET THE POINT THAT IT

01:24:49.951 --> 01:24:51.519
COSTS TO STEAL OUR MONEY TO DO

01:24:51.586 --> 01:24:53.354
IT TO GO AND ASK THE QUESTIONS

01:24:53.421 --> 01:24:54.722
AND REQUIRE PEOPLE RIGHT PROOF

01:24:54.789 --> 01:24:56.724

01:25:00.929 --> 01:25:02.831
SIMPLY SAVE UP TOO MUCH TOO BAD

01:25:02.897 --> 01:25:03.965
TO GO AND I REALIZE THAT

01:25:04.032 --> 01:25:05.099
SOMETIMES PEOPLE MAYOR RIGHT NOW

LIKE FROM THAT HE SAID OTHER

01:25:09.637 --> 01:25:11.339

01:25:20.782 --> 01:25:23.518

SUPPORT BUT IT THAT THE THE

01:25:45.273 --> 01:25:46.107
EXTENSIVE RESEARH ON THIS TOPIC --

01:25:46.174 --> 01:25:47.242

WITH THE CURRENT -- LAW SO SO

01:25:55.016 --> 01:25:56.384
I'M JUST A YEAR AND THE THINKING

01:25:58.219 --> 01:25:59.687
REALIZING THIS THE POLICY

01:25:59.754 --> 01:26:01.589
COMMITTEE BUT BUT SINCE YOU

01:26:01.656 --> 01:26:05.527
REFERENCE THE BUDGET -- T A

01:26:05.593 --> 01:26:06.561
PART OF ME IS THIS THINKING LIKE

01:26:06.628 --> 01:26:07.395
WELL THE AMOUNT OF MONEY WE'RE

01:26:07.462 --> 01:26:08.963
SAVING.

01:26:09.030 --> 01:26:10.164
BY.

01:26:10.231 --> 01:26:11.266
DECREASING THE OVERHEAD IN THE

01:26:11.332 --> 01:26:12.834
PROCESS.

01:26:12.901 --> 01:26:14.235
IS THAT I MEAN AND HOW THAT

01:26:14.302 --> 01:26:15.570
COMPARES WITH DID NOT OF QUOTE

01:26:15.637 --> 01:26:16.704
MONEY THAT WE'RE GONNA SPEND

01:26:16.771 --> 01:26:18.506
EXTRA BECAUSE WE'VE INCREASES

01:26:18.573 --> 01:26:19.707
OUR CASELOAD I GUESS THAT'S

01:26:19.774 --> 01:26:21.242
GONNA BE I MEAN OF WHAT WHAT'S

01:26:21.309 --> 01:26:23.244
GENERATING THE EXPENSE.

01:26:23.311 --> 01:26:24.245
IN THIS BILL I MEAN I RELIZE

01:26:24.312 --> 01:26:25.346
THIS IS.

01:26:25.413 --> 01:26:26.180
THAT'S FRIES THAT THAT'S A

01:26:26.247 --> 01:26:27.382
LITTLE MAYBE A LITTLE MORE PREP

01:26:27.448 --> 01:26:29.651
SITE QUESTION BUT AND YOU KNOW

01:26:29.717 --> 01:26:31.052
BUT I'M JUST THE END AND I THINK

01:26:31.119 --> 01:26:32.153
PART OF THESE GOING LIKE WELL

01:26:32.220 --> 01:26:33.922
IT'S ONLY 1% HOW MANY MORE HOW

01:26:33.988 --> 01:26:35.590
MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE COULD THIS

01:26:35.657 --> 01:26:37.292
BE TO DO THIS BILL THEN.

01:26:37.358 --> 01:26:39.160
THE NOT RIGHT AND HOW THE WORD

01:26:39.227 --> 01:26:41.095
IS APPROPRIATIONS PEOPLE EQUITY

01:26:41.162 --> 01:26:43.031
HOW DID HOW COME HOW DID THEY

01:26:43.097 --> 01:26:43.565
SAY WHY DO THEY SEE THIS

01:26:43.631 --> 01:26:43.865
EXPENSIVE.

01:26:43.932 --> 01:26:46.801

01:26:54.809 --> 01:26:56.778
MILLION.

01:26:56.844 --> 01:26:58.580
OKAY -- IT'S IT'S I DON'T THINK

01:26:58.646 --> 01:26:59.480
IT'S A MEGA EXPENSE BUT OF

01:26:59.547 --> 01:26:59.881
COURSE THE WAY THE

01:26:59.948 --> 01:27:01.049
APPROPRIATIONS PROCESS WORKS IS.

01:27:01.115 --> 01:27:02.550
YOU KNOW YOU IT EVEN IF YOU'RE

01:27:02.617 --> 01:27:03.151

POTENTIAL FOR ABUSES TO MINIMUS

01:27:24.405 --> 01:27:26.541
BUT YOU KNOW SOMETIMES ALL TEXAS

01:27:26.608 --> 01:27:28.109
AT ONE BAD EXAMPLE AND THEN

01:27:28.176 --> 01:27:31.279
SUDDENLY A PROGRAM IS UNDERMINED --

01:27:31.346 --> 01:27:32.714
AND I DON'T WANT TO SEE THAT

01:27:32.780 --> 01:27:35.583
EITHER SO I'M WONDERING -- IS

01:27:35.650 --> 01:27:37.719
THERE SOME KIND OF ON GOING

01:27:37.785 --> 01:27:41.022
BASIS SO IN OTHER WORDS TO FIGHT --

01:27:41.089 --> 01:27:43.558

A LET'S SEE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND

01:27:48.162 --> 01:27:54.068
DOLLARS OR LET'S SAY A HOUSE --

01:27:54.135 --> 01:27:54.769
IS THERE SOMETHING UNDER

01:27:54.836 --> 01:27:55.637
EXISTING CAL WORKS RULES THAT

01:27:55.703 --> 01:27:57.138
REQUIRES IF I WERE TO COME INTO

01:27:57.205 --> 01:27:58.706
SOMETHING LIKE THAT THAT I WOULD

01:27:58.773 --> 01:28:00.475
HAVE TO REPORT IT IN ORDER TO BE

01:28:00.541 --> 01:28:02.443
ABLE TO CONTINUE IF THAT'S THE

01:28:02.510 --> 01:28:04.012
CASE HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THIS.

01:28:04.078 --> 01:28:05.413
I DON'T MY TWENTY THOUSAND I

01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:07.448
DON'T MIND. THIRTY BUT I'M THE

01:28:07.515 --> 01:28:08.950
WORD TO AND WE'RE NOT TALKING

01:28:09.017 --> 01:28:11.019
ABOUT THE THE PEOPLE WHO GET TO

01:28:11.085 --> 01:28:12.754
TAKE TAX CREDITS AND WHAT HAVE

01:28:12.820 --> 01:28:14.389
YOU THE THOSE PEOPLE I'M NOT AT

01:28:14.455 --> 01:28:15.890
ALL CONCERNED BUT I'M CONCERNED

01:28:15.957 --> 01:28:18.326
ABOUT PEOPLE WHO IN SOME POINT.

01:28:18.393 --> 01:28:19.861
FIND THAT THEY GET TO COME INTO

01:28:19.927 --> 01:28:24.732
SOME LEVEL OF I WILL CALL IT

01:28:24.799 --> 01:28:27.468
WEALTH BUT SOME LEVEL OF THE

01:28:27.535 --> 01:28:28.870
THAT YOU KNOW BENEFIT.

01:28:28.936 --> 01:28:32.573
THAT THAT IS SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH

01:28:32.640 --> 01:28:33.608
THAT IT MIGHT.

01:28:33.675 --> 01:28:35.376
HAVE AFFECTED THEIR CAL WORKS IF

01:28:35.443 --> 01:28:36.811
THEY YOU HAD REPORTED.

01:28:36.878 --> 01:28:38.613
WELL I I THINK THAT IF YOU'RE

01:28:38.680 --> 01:28:41.215
TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW HUNDREDS

01:28:41.282 --> 01:28:44.018
OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS THE

01:28:44.085 --> 01:28:46.054
LET'S SAY.

01:28:46.120 --> 01:28:46.688
FIFTY THOUSAND A SOME MAY HAVE

01:28:46.754 --> 01:28:47.755
SOME POINT AGAIN THAT THE INCOME

01:28:47.822 --> 01:28:48.389
THAT YOU'RE EARNING FROM THAT

01:28:48.456 --> 01:28:50.024
WEALTH IS GOING TO DISQUALIFY

01:28:50.091 --> 01:28:51.159
YOU FROM.

01:28:51.225 --> 01:28:54.962
FROM CAL WORKS AND I I ALSO I DO

01:28:55.029 --> 01:28:56.364
AGREE WITH THE WITHIN PARCEL OF

01:28:56.431 --> 01:28:57.165
THAT.

01:28:57.231 --> 01:28:57.865
WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:28:57.932 --> 01:28:59.967
RECEIVING A PRETTY MODEST AMOUNT

01:29:00.034 --> 01:29:01.502
OF MONEY CAL WORKS IS NOT IN ARE

01:29:01.569 --> 01:29:03.237
NOT RECEIVING A LOT OF MONEY PER

01:29:03.304 --> 01:29:07.375
MONTH -- INTO THAT THE AYE I

01:29:07.442 --> 01:29:08.309
THINK IT WOULD BE.

01:29:08.376 --> 01:29:10.344
REALLY REALLY EXCEPTIONAL THAT

01:29:10.411 --> 01:29:11.579
SOMEONE HAS COME INTO

01:29:11.646 --> 01:29:12.880
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY SO

01:29:12.947 --> 01:29:14.182
LET ME GIVE YOU A SPECIFIC

01:29:14.248 --> 01:29:16.050
EXAMPLE ALL RIGHT LET'S ASSUME

01:29:16.117 --> 01:29:17.652
AS HYPOTHETICAL THAT SOMEONE

01:29:17.719 --> 01:29:19.821
COMES INTO SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND

01:29:19.887 --> 01:29:20.788
DOLLARS FROM AN UNCLE THEY

01:29:20.855 --> 01:29:22.056
DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT.

01:29:22.123 --> 01:29:24.292
THERE ON CAL WORKS TODAY OF ANY

01:29:24.358 --> 01:29:26.661
ROUTE LOT OF RESPONSIBILITY TO

01:29:26.728 --> 01:29:29.664
REPORT THAT MONEY.

01:29:29.731 --> 01:29:32.033
UNDER THIS BILL NOW.

01:29:32.100 --> 01:29:32.867
TODAY HAVE HOWEVER IF THEY PUT

01:29:32.934 --> 01:29:34.335
INTO AN ACCOUNT AND THEY DREW

01:29:34.402 --> 01:29:36.104
DOWN THE MONEY ON A MONTHLY

01:29:36.170 --> 01:29:37.305
BASIS TO PAY THEIR BILLS IT

01:29:37.371 --> 01:29:38.606
WOULD IT WOULD BE COUNTED UNDER

01:29:38.673 --> 01:29:40.742
CURRENT LAW AS INCOME SO IF THE

01:29:40.808 --> 01:29:42.210
MONEY SAT IN THE ACCOUNT IF THIS

01:29:42.276 --> 01:29:43.444
BILL PASSED.

01:29:43.511 --> 01:29:44.812
ON THE SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND

01:29:44.879 --> 01:29:45.480
DOLLARS AT THE COUNT THEY DIDN'T

01:29:45.546 --> 01:29:47.548
TOUCH IT THEY COULDN'T USE IT.

01:29:47.615 --> 01:29:49.784
BUT IF THE BUT YOU KNOW IT WITH

01:29:49.851 --> 01:29:51.252
THAT CONTINUE TO RECEIVE AID BUT

01:29:51.319 --> 01:29:55.256
IF IT IF THEY DO THAT MONEY DOWN --

01:29:55.323 --> 01:29:57.191
AT AND MORE THAN OCE THEN THEY

01:29:57.258 --> 01:29:58.659
WOULD END UP HAVING TO COUNT AS

01:29:58.726 --> 01:29:59.427
INCOME.

01:29:59.494 --> 01:30:01.395
UNDER UNDER THE LAW CURRENTLY

01:30:01.462 --> 01:30:03.898
AND IF PASSED RESOURCES DRAWN

01:30:03.965 --> 01:30:07.001
DOWN -- FROM AN ACCOUNT ON A

01:30:07.068 --> 01:30:09.470
REGULAR BASIS COUNT NOT ONLY FOR

01:30:09.537 --> 01:30:11.873
FOR AT CAL EXPENDABLE ALSO FOR

01:30:11.939 --> 01:30:14.509
COVERAGE BENEFITS -- SO SO THAT

01:30:14.575 --> 01:30:15.977
HAVE HAD A SELF REPORT I'M JUST

01:30:16.043 --> 01:30:17.378
TRYING TO FIGURE THE AT TWO

01:30:17.445 --> 01:30:19.614
UNDER CURRENT LAW THEY GOT THE

01:30:19.680 --> 01:30:20.915
SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS --

01:30:20.982 --> 01:30:22.650
AND I YOU KNOW I JUST HAS A LIKE

01:30:22.717 --> 01:30:24.152
LACKEY THEM FOR THEIR UNCLE

01:30:24.218 --> 01:30:25.753
ACTUALLY MY UNCLES AT WHAT THEY

01:30:25.820 --> 01:30:28.022
LEAVE ME IS NOT ANY OF THAT --

01:30:28.089 --> 01:30:31.859
BUT IF THEY I'M HAPPY TO BE IN

01:30:31.926 --> 01:30:34.228
ADOPTED.

01:30:34.295 --> 01:30:35.029
BUT LET'S ASSUME THAT HAPPENS

01:30:35.096 --> 01:30:36.164
THAT IF THEY GET INSTANCE WHERE

01:30:36.230 --> 01:30:37.265
DOES AND SUDDENLY OKAY THING

01:30:37.331 --> 01:30:38.099
WILL BE SO IF THEY GOT THEY GOT

01:30:38.166 --> 01:30:39.500
THE MONEY TODAY THAT HAVE TO

01:30:39.567 --> 01:30:41.569
REPORTED TODAY -- AS AN ASSET

01:30:41.636 --> 01:30:42.770
AND IT WOULD MAKE THEM ELIGIBLE

01:30:42.837 --> 01:30:45.206
IMMEDIATELY BUT IF THEY GOT IT

01:30:45.273 --> 01:30:46.874
AND IF THIS BILL PASSED AND THEY

01:30:46.941 --> 01:30:48.509
GOT THE MONEY THEY WOULDN'T

01:30:48.576 --> 01:30:50.211
REPORT IT AS AN ASSET THE MINUTE

01:30:50.278 --> 01:30:51.345
THEY STARTED DRYING IT DOWN TO

01:30:51.412 --> 01:30:52.680
USE IT THEY HAVE TO REPORT IT AS

01:30:52.747 --> 01:30:54.882
INCOME -- AND AND THAT INCOME

01:30:54.949 --> 01:30:56.083
WOULD HAVE TO BECOME A INCLUDE

01:30:56.150 --> 01:30:58.553
SOUNDS AND CAL WORKS OR SNAP.

01:30:58.619 --> 01:31:00.488
HOW FASHION COLORS AND SO THAT

01:31:00.555 --> 01:31:01.622
MY HOPE YOU YEAH IT DOES A YEAR

01:31:01.689 --> 01:31:02.890
JUST THERE HAS TO BE SOME?

01:31:02.957 --> 01:31:05.359
SOME PROTECTION THERE BECAUSE

01:31:05.426 --> 01:31:06.861
YOU KNOW I DON'T HEAR THE WORD

01:31:06.928 --> 01:31:08.896
WELFARE QUEEN ONE MORE TIME AND

01:31:08.963 --> 01:31:09.597
YOU KNOW.

01:31:09.664 --> 01:31:11.032
THAT WHAT THE IF YOU.

01:31:11.098 --> 01:31:13.434
IF EVERYTHING IS SO OPEN AND

01:31:13.501 --> 01:31:14.902
NINETY NINE POINT 9% OF PEOPLE

01:31:14.969 --> 01:31:16.170
ARE FOLLOWING THE RULES IT'S

01:31:16.237 --> 01:31:20.174
THAT ONE TENTH 1% THAT HURT YOU

01:31:20.241 --> 01:31:21.375
AND SO I WILL I AM HOPING WE

01:31:21.442 --> 01:31:22.643
DON'T REALLY HAVE AN ENDO AND

01:31:22.710 --> 01:31:23.477
THE OTHER STATES TO DO THIS THIS

01:31:23.544 --> 01:31:25.046
IS NOT BEEN.

01:31:25.112 --> 01:31:28.316
AN ISSUE SO THAT I CAN ALWAYS BE

01:31:28.382 --> 01:31:29.283
EXTREME SITUATION.

01:31:29.350 --> 01:31:30.751
WELL IT TO THE EXTENT THAT WE

01:31:30.818 --> 01:31:32.587
HAVE SO THERE HAS TO BE THERE IS

01:31:32.653 --> 01:31:34.288
A REPORTING MECHANISM IN ALL

01:31:34.355 --> 01:31:35.790
UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THE BILL.

01:31:35.857 --> 01:31:38.526
NOT CONTINUE THAT TRADITION AS

01:31:38.593 --> 01:31:47.134
WATER BELGIUM FOR THE CRIMES.

01:31:47.201 --> 01:31:49.570
THAT THE THE TYPE OF AREAS WHERE

01:31:49.637 --> 01:31:51.038
YOU COULD SAVE IS -- IS IN TERMS

01:31:51.105 --> 01:31:52.073
OF THE SIMPLIFICATION THAT WE'RE

01:31:52.139 --> 01:31:52.540
TALKING ABOUT HERE.

01:31:52.607 --> 01:31:53.774
IS IT BE CONSISTENT WITH THE CAL

01:31:53.841 --> 01:31:55.276
WORKS PROCESS THE CAL FRESH

01:31:55.343 --> 01:31:56.844
