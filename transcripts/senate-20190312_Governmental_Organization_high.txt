GOOD SENATOR GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES -- WE'RE WAITING. FOR A WITNESS ON THE THER ITEM WHO IS IN A CURRENTLY A SMALL CRASH THIS MORNING SO HE'S A LITTLE DELAYED AND I APPRECIATE YOUR INDULGENCE AND STARTING. WITH FILE ITEM ONE SIXTEEN A MEASURE ON PIPELINE SAFETY -- THIS BILL WILL STRENGTHEN SAFETY ENFORCEMENT OF INTRA. STATE OIL PIPELINES THAT MEANS WERE ALL WITHIN STATE LINE SO IT IS A STATE. OBLIGATION AND IS NOT SUBJECT TO FEDERAL RULES BECAUSE WE ARE TALKING ONLY ABOUT THAT OIL WHICH IS TRANSPORTED WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA. AND IT WILL STRENGTHEN THOSE SAFETY ENFORCEMENT. REQUIREMENTS BY ENSURING THAT THOSE PIPELINES ARE COVERED BY OUR STATE CRITICAL SAFETY PROGRAM REGARDLESS OF OPERATING PRESSURE. M. BY BOLSTERING OUR REGULATORS ABILITY TO REQUEST READ RECORDS FROM OERATORS. NOTABLY THE BILL CLOSES N EXEMPTION. FOR PIPELINES THAT OPERATE OFTEN AT VERY LOW PRESSURES OFTEN DOING SO TO AVOID HAVING TO COMPLY WITH CALIFORNIA'S REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. ADDITIONALLY THE BILL SPECIFIES THE KINDS OF RECORDS THAT MUST BE KEPT BY PIPELINE OPERATORS AND AUTHORIZES THE OFFICE OF STATE FIRE MARSHAL TO REQUEST THOSE RECORDS FOR INSPECTION PURPOSES. SO WHY WHY THIS BILL. WELL AFTER THE CATASTROPHIC TWENTY FIFTEEN REVIEW FUEL OIL SPILL IN SANTA BARBARA COUNTY. THIS LEGISLATURE PASSED TO TWO IMPORTANT PIECES OF LEGISLATION THE GREATLY ENHANCE OUR STATE OIL PIPELINE SAFETY PROGRAM. ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHT SIXTY FOUR PHONE TWO EMPLOYEE BEST AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGIES. IT SHOULDN'T BE TOO DIFFICULT BUT JUST SIMPLY SAID YOU HAVE TO APPLY THOSE BEST EMPLOY THOSE TECHNOLOGIES. AND A BILL I AUTHORED SB. TWO NINETY FIVE UP THE INSPECTION INTERVAL TO ANNUALLY RATHER THAN USING THE FEDERAL BASIS OF EVERY FIVE YEARS. THEN IN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND TWENTY SIXTEEN AGAIN IN ALAMEDA. THERE WAS -- WERE TO RUPTURES OF OIL. PIPELINES THAT WERE BECAUSE SIMILARLY BY CORROSIVE PIPELINES HAD THEY BEEN INSPECTED MORE REGULARLY WE WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO IDENTIFY. THAT THESE PROBLEMS EXISTED AND THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN CORRECTED BEFORE THESE SPILLS OCCURRED. NOW. UNFORTUNATELY WHAT WE SINCE THAT BILL PASSED WE HAVE SEEN A NUMBER OF COMPANIES TRY TO AVOID COMPLIANCE OR AVOID PARTICIPATION IN THAT ANNUAL -- SAFETY SYSTEM. BY REDUCING THE PRESSURE TO BELOW THE AMOUNT THAT IS REQUIRED IN ORDER. TO PROVIDE THOSE ANNUAL REPORTS OTHER AMENDMENTS TO THE STATE'S PIPELINE REGULATORY PROGRAM THAT WERE MADE TO CONFORM WITH STATE WITH FEDERAL LAW. LEAVE A GAP IN OUR STATE PROGRAM THAT THIS BILL SEEKS TO CLOSE. SPECIFICALLY. THIS BILL TO LEAD TO AN EXEMPTION IN STATE LAW THAT WAS TAKEN TO CONFORM WITH FEDERAL LAW BACK IN. NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT EXCUSE ME NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT SO MANY MANY YEARS AGO WE WERE. LOOKING TO HAVE THAT CONSISTENCY WITH FEDERAL LAW. AND THAT EXCLUDED PIPELINES OPERATING UNDER 20% OF THEIR SPECIFIED MAXIMUM YIELD PRESSURE. FROM STATE OVERSIGHT THEY WOULD BE FEDERALLY NOT REQUIRED BY THE STATE THAT IS SORT OF THE THE DEFAULT THAT THESE COMPANIES ARE TRYING TO USE NOW TO AVOID COMPLIANCE WITH OUR HIGHER STANDARD WHICH EXIST BY THE WAIT FOR PRACTICAL REASONS AND THAT IS WE HAVE DISCOVERED IS MENTIONED -- THE CORROSIVE NATURE THESE PIPELINES WHICH IF NOT ADDRESSED BY STUDYING ON AN ANNUAL BASIS CAN AND HAVE CAUSED. EXTREME CONDITIONS. AND ECONOMIC DISASTERS FRANKLY THAT OCCURRED IN MY DISTRICT AND I KNOW ONE ALAMEDA THE CONSEQUENCES OF THESE OIL SPILLS. ON THE ENVIRONMENT AND ON THE ECONOMY ARE SIGNIFICANT SO DELETING THIS EXEMPTION IS IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL REGULAR PIPELINES INVOLVED IN THE TRANSPORT. OF HAZARDOUS LIQUIDS INCLUDING OIL ARE INSPECTED ANNUALLY AND EMPLOY THE BEST AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGIES. THESE -- THERE A PIPELINE TO CAN BE RUN FOR EXTENDED PERIODS OF TIME UNDER LOWER. OPERATING UNDER LOW PRESSURE THAT STILL TRANSPORT AND ECONOMIC PRODUCT BUT AGAIN AREN'T COVERED UNDER THE ARE STRONGER LAW SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TIGHTEN THE LAW. TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC IT TO PROTECT AGAINST THESE EVENTS OCCURRING AND USING BEST AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT THESE COMPANIES SHOULD BE DOING ANYWAY. ADDITIONALLY THIS MEASURE SPECIFIES THAT RECORDS MUST BE PRODUCED UPON INSPECTION BY THE OFFICE OF THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL WHO HAS RESPONSIBILITY IN THE AREA OF OIL TRANSPORT. CURRENTLY THE LAW IS UNCLEAR ABOUT THE TYPE THE TYPES OF RECORDS THAT MUST BE COMPILED COLLECTED AND PRODUCED AND THE AUTHORITY OF THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL TO COMPEL RECORDS WAS ALSO UNCLEAR. SO THIS BILL WILL BOTH FOR THE FAR AND THE CALL TO PRODUCE THOSE -- FOR THERE WAS THERE IS NO OPPOSITION LISTED WE JUST RECEIVED A VERY LATE OPPOSITION -- BY THE WESTERN STATES PETROLEUM ASSOCIATION -- THEIR CONCERNS AS I UNDERSTAND IT HAVE TO DO WITH THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF THESE RECORDS A TO THE EXTENT THAT THEIR CONCERNS DON'T IN ANY WAY IMPEDE WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH I'M CERTAINLY HAPPY. TO WORK WITH THEM IT IS NOT OUR INTENT TO REVEAL ANY KIND OF TRADE SECRETS OF THE INTENT OF THIS BILL IS EXACTLY AS I HAVE ARTICULATED HERE TODAY. AND WE WILL CERTAINLY BE HAPPY TO WORK. WITH THE ANY OPPOSITION THAT. HAS CONCERNS THAT ARE AGAIN NOT GOING TO UNDERMINE THE INTENT OF THIS BILL. SO WITH ME I HAVE A DAN JACOBSON FROM ENVIRONMENT CALIFORNIA TO SPEAK ON THE IMPORTANCE OF STRONG STATE STANDARDS. IN SAFEGUARDING OUR INTRA STATE HAZARDOUS LIQUID. PIPELINES AND WITH THAT I WOULD ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND AGAIN THANK YOU TO SENATORS. TO SENATOR JACKSON FOR ONCE AGAIN BRINGING FORWARD SOME CRITICAL ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION. OIL SPILLS ARE DIRTY AND DANGEROUS AND EVEN A SALL CASE SOMETIMES IN THE CASE OF THOUSANDS OR TENS OF THOUSANDS OF GALLONS IS BAD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT. THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS CAUSED BY THIS BILL CAN REALLY FALL INTO THREE CATEGORIES FIRST IS THE WATER CONTAMINATION OFTENTIMES THESE BILLS WHILE THEY MAY BE DETECTED WITHIN A FEW HOURS. TAKE DAYS IF NOT WEEKS TO GET CLEANED UP IN WHICH CASE THE OIL HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO LEAK INTO THE GROUND WATER. THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE IN THE STATE WERE TRYING TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE SAFE AND CLEAN DRINKING WATER. TWO IS THE LAND IN SOIL CONTAMINATION SIMILAR TO THE WATER CONTAMINATION ONCE THIS OIL LEAKS INTO THE GROUND IT CAN TAKE YEARS TO CLEAN UP AND COST TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO DO SO. AND THIRD OBVIOUSLY THE ECOSYSTEM IMPACTS THAT ARE CAUSED BY THESE BILLS NO ONE NEEDS TO BE REMINDED AGAIN OF THE SOIL BIRCHER SOILED ANIMALS THAT ARE IMPACTED BY THIS. BUT IT'S NOT JUST ONE SMALL PLACE IT'S IMPACTED IT'S THE WHOLE ECOSYSTEM THAT HAS TO FACE THE IMPACT WHEN WE SEE THESE BILLS EVEN IF THEY'RE SMALL. THE SECOND POINT THAT I THINK IS THAT OIL SPILLS ARE UNAVOIDABLE WE'RE ALWAYS GOING TO HAVE THEM THERE'S JUST NO GUARANTEE TO MOVE OIL FROM POINT A TO POINT B. ENSURE THAT THERE'S NO LEAKS. SOMETIMES THESE LEAKS ARE LARGE THANKFULLY THAT'S A VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THE TIME BUT THE SMALL LEAKS ADD UP THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF THE SMALL LEAKS CONTINUE TO HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR ENVIRONMENT. IN -- WE NEED TO BE DOING EVERYTHING ENSURE THAT EVERY FORM OF TRANSPORTATION OF OIL AND OTHER HAZARDOUS MATERIAL IS DONE AS SAFELY AS POSSIBLE IN. ALL JUST END BY SAYING THAT WE HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN DO THIS IN A SAFER FASHION. AND WE SHOULD BE DOING OBVIOUSLY EVERYTHING WE CAN TO ENSURE THAT EVERY DROP OF OIL OR OTHER HAZARDOUS MATERIAL THAT WE'RE MOVING IN THE STATE. CAN BE DONE SO IT DOESN'T IMPACT OUR ENVIRONMENT AND IT HAS NO IMPACT ON OUR HEALTH. I'LL CLOSE BY SAYING OBVIOUSLY AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THERE ARE TIMES TO ROLL BACK SOME OF THE BASIC PROTECTIONS THAT WE'RE SEEING WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THE CALIFORNIA NOT ONLY STAYS THE COURSE. BUT CONTINUES TO MOVE FORWARD ON THIS ISSUE WITH THAT I'D SAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND ASHLEY RIVAL. ANYBODY ELSE IN FAVOR. CASING NINE ANYBODY IN OPPOSITION. MORNING TERM YOU MAKE YOU MAY COME UP HERE. GET A BIG KIDS SEE TODAY. MORE. SO FOUR STAR ACCOUNT I'VE KIND OF FILL DID USE FOUR STARS ARE RULES ARE -- TO UP TO TWO SPEAKER SEASIDE FOR TWO MINUTES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR WILL BE VERY BRIEF FUND WE CENTERS WITH THE WESTERN STATES PETROLEUM ASSOCIATION AGAIN WE APOLOGIZE FOR THE VERY LATE LETTER -- I DON'T THINK WE DISAGREE WITH THE AUTHOR'S INTENT OF THIS BILL AND ENSURING PROPER PROTECTIONS HOWEVER. AS A BY PRODUCT OF ENHANCING WHAT THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL MAY -- RECEIVE AND HOW THE THE DATA WE JUST WANT TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR TO DEVELOP LANGUAGE OUT TO PROVIDE PROPER CONTROLS REGARDING. THE SHARING OF DATA -- THAT SEEM APPROPRIATE AND HOW THE US OF I SHARES AND DISTRIBUTES THAT DATA -- AND AND TO WHOM SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. A MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THE PAY HOST REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT PETROVSKY HATE OIL SPILLS WE HATE -- ANIMALS MARINE MAN ANIMALS COVERED IN OIL IT'S A HORRIBLE -- IT'S AWFUL ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION WE WE WE SUPPORT THE SENATORS -- EFFORTS TO ENHANCE THE STATE'S ALL SAFETY PIPELINE PROGRAM BUT LIKE THE PREVIOUS WITNESS -- WE ARE OPPOSE BECAUSE OF CONFIDENTIALITY CONCERNS -- OTHER BILLS THAT WE'VE HAD OVER THE YEARS BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE WE'VE HAD THE SAME CONCERNS. AND YOU'VE BEEN ABLE TO DEAL WITH THAT INFORMATION AND ASSET THAT SAME BE DONE HERE -- AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE OPPOSE AND LESS AMEND. THANK YOU ANY OTHERS SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE PULL BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS COMMENTS CONCERNS. MR GORGEOUS. THEY GIVE A STRUCTURE. A GOOD MORNING. JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY A COUPLE OF THINGS SO [inaudible] CAN YOU. A REAL ADDRESS THE THE FEDERAL OBLIGATION TO OVERSEE PIPELINES. AND IN WHAT IS YOUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION. IS PULLING BACK THE OVERSIGHT OF THOSE PIPELINES WAS THAT ONLY INTERSTATE OR INTRASTATE INSPECTION AS WELL THE FEDERAL RESPONSIBILITIES INTERSTATE CALIFORNIA HAS RESPONSIBILITY IN TRUST STATE. WHAT WE DID BACK IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT WAS TRYING TO FALL THE FEDERAL REGULATION OF EVERY FIVE YEARS -- WE WE'VE FOUND IS RESULTS SADLY THAT THAT IS NOT ADEQUATE THAT THE CORROSIVE NATURE OF THESE PIPELINES IS SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD BE. LOOKING AT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS SO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. YOU RESPECTIVELY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WAS DOING OR IS PLANNING TO DO SAID YOU KNOW WHAT FIVE YEARS I INADEQUATE AND WE ARE GOING TO REQUIRE. THAT THE THERE'D BE AN INSPECTION ANNUALLY AND IN FACT AND YOU COULD ARGUE TO IN PART THAT THE NATURE OF THE OIL TODAY IS INDEED FAR MORE CORROSIVE THAN IT WAS BACK -- THIRTY FORTY YEARS AGO HE HELPED ME HONE IN STATE ARE WE TALKING ABOUT THE NETWORK ITSELF WE TALK ABOUT THE ACTUAL PIECE OF PIPING. FIVE THE NET IT'S BASICALLY THE NETWORK SO WHAT WE DO IS WE DRILL OIL FOR EXAMPLE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY THIS INSTANCE THAT HAPPENED -- A COUPLE YEARS AGO -- UP IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA THE DRILL IT IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND THEN TO HYPE IT UP TO THE REFINERIES IN THE BAY AREA. SO THAT IS INTRA STATE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT DEALING WITH ANYTHING ON A FEDERAL BASIS WHICH IS DEALING WITH WHAT WE CAN DO HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND AND REGARDING THE CONCERNS OF PROPRIETARY INFORMATION THAT WE'VE HEARD FROM TO THE REPRESENTATIVES HERE FROM WAS BY A WITH THIS BE SUBJECT TO A PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT IF IT GOES. TO THROUGH THE FIRE MARSHAL. YEAH I THINK IT'S TWO FOLD I THINK IT'S A COULD BE SUBJECT TO A PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST AND LOOK AGENCIES DO THEIR BASS WHEN THEY COMPILE A LARGE AMOUNT OF DATA THAT THAT DATA CAN GET OUT. IN THESE ARE YOU KNOW SOFT TARGETS AS EASY FOR US. TO SECURE THE BORDERS OF OUR PROPERTY BUT WHEN YOU GET HAVE PIPELINES THAT RUN MILES YOU KNOW THERE ARE A CONCERN OF ALL TYPES OF ENVIRONMENTAL TERRORISM -- OTHER CONCERNS OF REVOLVING AROUND THE SAFETY THOSE PIPELINES AND AGAIN -- WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT COMPLAINING HERE ABOUT THE ENHANCE SAFETY IT'S WHICH REALLY JUST SOME OF THE CONFERENCE OUT OF THAT INFORMATION. IN YOUR OKAY AS LONG AS MEMBERS ARE BEING MADE BY THE MAKER OF THE ITEM. WELL WE WOULD WOULD HAVE TO SEE THOSE AMENDMENTS ARE ULTIMATELY OKAY. ANYONE ELSE CENTER ARCHULETA YEAH THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR UP CENTER I I THOUGHT YOUR PRESENTATION WAS EXCELLENT BUT BE PERFECTLY HONEST WITH YOU. THE ENVIRONMENT THE OIL TRANSPORTATION -- OF AT AND I THINK YOU ADDRESSED THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT THE PRIVACY THAT YOU ALSO SAID THAT YOU WOULD BE WORKING WITH HIM TO FIND A COMPROMISE. SO -- THAT WOULD BE IN THE PART AND THE QUALITY OF OF THE MESSAGE AND DE CAREFUL TO DISSEMINATE IT TO THE WRONG PARTIES AND SO ON SO I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO LOOK AT THAT. TO MAKE SURE THE SECURITY -- IN THE INFORMATION IS IS HANDLED CORRECT. THE GOAL IS A IS I UNDERSTAND IT IS THE CONFIDENTIALITY. THE FIRE MARSHAL OF MY ON MY EXPERIENCE AND UNDERSTAND IS THAT INFORMATION IS NOT DISSEMINATED. BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN RESOLVE ANY. LEGITIMATE CONCERNS ABOUT THIS WE'RE CERTAINLY HAPPY TO DO THAT. THANK YOU AND I'M AND I'M REALLY APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU BRING IN THIS BEFORE US BECAUSE ALL OF US ARE CONCERNED ABOUT% OUR ENVIRONMENT. AND THE TRANSPORTATION OF OF OUR OILS AND SO ON SO I APPRECIATE I THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER [inaudible] ANYONE ELSE. CENTER GALGIANI -- I WANNA THANK YOU AND I WILL BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL TODAY BUT I TO SHARE CONCERNS ABOUT THE PROPER CONTROLS FOR THE SHARING OF DATA AND TRUST THAT. YOU WORK WITH THE OPPONENTS AND COME UP WITH SOME LANGUAGE THAT THAT IDENTIFIES THE CASES IN WHICH THEY CAN SHARE THE DATA ABSOLUTELY. I'M GOING TO ECHO THE THE SENATOR'S COMMENTS -- IN MY OWN ASSEMBLY DISTRICT I HAD ENVIRONMENTAL DISASTER I FELT LIKE IT WAS IT WAS UNDER REGULATED -- IN HINDSIGHT IT WAS -- JUST WRITTEN JUST READ THE THE OPPOSITION SO THEY DO HAVE CONSENT SOME CONCERNS YOU MADE A PLACE HERE TODAY TO TO WORK WITH THE OTHER SIDE AND SO I'M A VOTE FOR YOUR BILL TODAY RESERVE THE RIGHT IF WE DON'T COME TO AGREEMENT TO CHANGE MY MIND LATER. BUT WITH THAT LET'S GO AHEAD AND TO THE BILL HAS BEEN MOVE SO LET'S GO AHEAD AND CALL THE FILE ITEM SIX SB ONE SIXTY NINE MOTION IS DUE PASSED TO APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE DODD.

A KEY CENTER WILL. NOW WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO FILE ITEM. THREE SB FORTY SIX ONCE AGAIN SENATOR JACKSON'S. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS [inaudible] IS [inaudible] OKAY. I WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT. TO FOR THE SENATE BILL FORTY SIX IT IS A MEASURE THAT EXPANDS. MY ALERT IN WARNING BILL FROM LAST YEAR WHICH WAS AS BE A TWENTY ONE THIS BILL EXPANDS THAT MEASURE BY ALLOWING CITIES AND UNIVERSITIES TO AUTOMATICALLY. ENROLL STUDENTS RESIDENTS AND EMPLOYEES IN LOCALLY OPERATED EMERGENCY ALERT SYSTEMS WHILE PRESERVING THEIR ABILITY TO OPT OUT OF THE SYSTEM. SB FORTY SIX CLARIFIES THAT ALERTING AUTHORITIES MAY USE WIRELESS TELEPHONE SUBSCRIBER DATA. FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE. THE SOLE PURPOSE OF PROVIDING EMERGENCY NOTIFICATIONS. AND ALLOWS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO IDENTIFY RESIDENTS WITH ACCESS AND FUNCTIONAL NEEDS. IN ORDER TO SEND THEM SPECIALIZED EMERGENCY ALERTS. THIS BILL ALSO REQUIRES TELECOMMUNICATIONS OPERATORS TO ANNUALLY PRODUCE DATA CONCERNING THE PERFORMANCE OF WIRELESS INFRASTRUCTURE USED TO SEND EMERGENCY ALERTS THE CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS. COLLEAGUES AS YOU WELL KNOW. AND HAVE IN MANY INSTANCES EXPERIENCED. THE LARGEST AND MOST DESTRUCTIVE WILDFIRE SEASONS IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY. A COMBINATION OF YEARS OF DROUGHT FUELS ACCUMULATION AND CLIMATE CHANGE INTO SEVERE WEATHER. WHICH HAS RESULTED IN WILDFIRES OF UNPRECEDENTED SIZE AND INTENSITY WHICH HAVE KILLED OVER A HUNDRED AND TWENTY CALIFORNIANS DESTROYED THOUSANDS OF HOMES. AND BURNED OVER WELL OVER A MILLION ACRES OF LAND. THESE FREQUENT LARGE SCALE WATER FIRES HAVE FOCUSED ATTENTION ON HOW CALIFORNIA WARNS THE PUBLIC DURING EMERGENCIES. IN THE OLD DAYS THE CHURCH BELLS RANG. WHEN I WAS A KID GOING GROWING UP WE HAD THE CONRAD? EARLY WARNING SYSTEM WE THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO RUSSIA BIG SYSTEM WOULD GO OFF ON YOUR RADIO OR IN THE COMMUNITY WE DON'T HAVE THOSE ANYMORE. SO THE QUESTION IS WHAT DO WE DO WHEN WE ARE SORT OF FACING AN EMERGENCY WHEN A WILDFIRE IS MOVING AT RAPID SPEED HOW DO WE LET PEOPLE KNOW THAT THEY ARE IN DANGER. AND WHAT THEY NEED TO DO TO GET OUT OF HARM'S WAY. THESE FREQUENT FIRES HAVE SHOWN US THE HOLES IN OUR SYSTEM. AND ART AND THE FACT THAT ARE WARNING SYSTEMS COME IN A VARIETY OF FORMS AND EACH HAS SPECIFIC CAPABILITIES AS WELL AS DRAWBACKS SYSTEMS RANGE FROM RELATIVELY LOW TECH OPTIONS. LIKE OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT LITERALLY GOING DOOR TO DOOR. TO TELL PEOPLE THEY MUST VACATE. TO OUTDOOR WARNING SIRENS TO AUTO DARLING TELEPHONES THAT CAN RELAY DETAILED EMERGENCY INFORMATION TO HOUSES AT A BLOCK BY BLOCK LEVEL. ONE OF THE MORE MODERN SYSTEMS IN CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS THE WEST IS THE A LOT -- WIRELESS EMERGENCY ALERT SYSTEM THE OUIJA SYSTEM IT'S CALLED. ADMINISTERED BY FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION'S. COMMISSION WE ARE ALLOWS MOBILE PHONE SUBSCRIBERS TO RECEIVE GEOGRAPHICALLY TARGETED TAX LIKE MESSAGES ALERTING THEM OF IMMINENT THREATS TO SAFETY IN THEIR AREA. BUT IT TOO HAS ITS LIMITATIONS BECAUSE IT LACKS. ACTUAL PRECISION IT'S VERY SHORT IN TERMS OF THE MESSAGING IT CAN DO AND THERE'S NO WAY FOR TWO WAY COMMUNICATION. AS AN EXAMPLE DURING OUR FAR TWO THIRTY IN THE MORNING MY CELL PHONE WENT OFF WITH THE WE ALERT. RIGHT NO IDEA WHERE EXACTLY THE PROBLEM WAS WAS IT TEN MILES AWAY WAS IT FIVE MILES AWAY WAS IT NEXT DOOR AND I COULD NOT INTERACT WITH IT TO FIND OUT JUST EXACTLY WHERE THIS EMERGENCY WAS OCCURRING. NOW MANY JURISDICTIONS IN CALIFORNIA AND BY THE WAY DID SCARE THE HECK OUT OF ME AS WELL. AND IT WAS HARD GOING BACK TO SLEEP AFTER THAT AND MANY OF MY NEIGHBORS AND THE PEOPLE WITHIN THIS WE A SYSTEM GOT THE SAME TEXT AND THE LORD AND ALSO DID NOT KNOW WHAT THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO DO. SO MANY JURISDICTIONS IN CALIFORNIA SUPPLEMENTS SYSTEMS LIKE WE ARE. WITH THEIR OWN LOCALLY OPERATED EMERGENCY NOTIFICATION SYSTEMS IN ORDER TO A MORE EFFECTIVELY COMMUNICATE WITH RESIDENTS DURING AN EMERGENCY. THE SYSTEM SOMEONE CALLED NICK SOUL CODE RED AND OTHERS. CAN SEND PRE RECORDED MESSAGES TO LAND LINE TELEPHONES LOCATED WITHIN A DEFINED TARGET AREA. AS WELL AS SEND TEXT INVOICE A LARGE TO MOBILE TELEPHONES WHICH MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ARE USING TO THE EXCLUSION OF LAND LINE SO THEY BECOME A CRITICAL PLAYER. IN THIS EMERGENCY ALERT SYSTEM. GIVEN THE UNIQUE ABILITY TO TARGET ALERTS USING PHYSICAL ADDRESSES LOCALLY OPERATED NO NOTIFICATION SYSTEMS ARE AMONG THE MOST PRECISE EMERGENCY NOTIFICATION SYSTEMS IN USE TODAY. BUT BECAUSE REGISTRATION OF MOBILE PHONES WAS NOT UNTIL RECENTLY AN AUTOMATIC PROCESS MANY JURISDICTIONS HAVE STRUGGLED TO GET RESIDENTS TO SIGN UP TO RECEIVE THESE ALERTS. FOR EXAMPLE WHEN THE THOMAS FIRE THEN THE LARGEST FIRE IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY BROKE OUT IN MY DISTRICT. LESS THAN 30% OF RESIDENTS IN THE AFFECTED AREA HAD ACTUALLY SIGNED UP TO RECEIVE COUNTY GENERATED CELL PHONE AND EMAIL ALERTS LESS THAN 30%. SO LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE PASSED SB EIGHT TWENTY ONE WHICH AUTHORIZED COUNTY EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT OFFICIALS TO AUTOMATICALLY ENROLL RESIDENTS IN COUNTY OPERATED SYSTEMS. IT ENSURES THAT RESIDENTS WHO DO NOT SEE THESE ALERTS HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO OPT OUT. YOU'RE IN UNLESS YOU DON'T WANT TO BE AND THEN YOU CAN OPT OUT. AND IT ALSO SPECIFICALLY RESTRICTS COUNTIES FROM USING PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT THEY OBTAIN TO ENROLL RESIDENTS IN THIS NOTIFICATION SYSTEM FOR ANY. OTHER PURPOSE PERIOD. IT IS NOT AVAILABLE TO LAW ENFORCEMENT FOR ANY OTHER PURPOSE THAN THESE ALERTS BECAUSE THAT IS THE SOLE AND SINGULAR FUNCTION. OF THESE ALERT PROGRAMS THIS BILL WAS A NECESSARY STEP TOWARD INCREASING THE PERCENTAGE OF RESIDENTS WHO RECEIVE EMERGENCY ALERTS FROM COUNTY OFFICIALS BUT MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE TO IMPROVE THE DISSEMINATION AND UTILITY. OF MESSAGES SENT. AND WE SAW SUBSEQUENT FIRES WE SAW THE WALLS THE FIRE WHERE STUDENTS WERE ASKED -- TO STAY ON SITE WE CALL IT. SHELTERING ON SITE HOW DID THEY KNOW TO DO THAT WELL IT TURNS OUT THAT A LOT OF THE UNIVERSITY POLICE DEPARTMENTS ACTUALLY DID NOT HAVE ACCESS. TO THEIR INFORMATION THE SAME THING IT TO US CSU CHANNEL ISLANDS TO MY DISTRICT WHICH HAS SUFFERED A FEW A COUPLE FIRES OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS. HOW DO YOU LET THE STUDENTS KNOW AND SO THE BILL THIS YEAR ADD CITIES? AND UNIVERSITIES TO THE PROGRAM SO THAT THEY CAN WARN STUDENTS AND WARN PEOPLE WITHIN THEIR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING AND WHAT THEY NEED TO DO. TO BE SAFE UNDER THESE HORRIFIC SORT BILL WILL HELP ENSURE THAT MORE CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS RECEIVED CRITICAL EMERGENCY ALERTS BY EXPANDING THE OP OUT SYSTEM. IT CLARIFIES THAT ALERTING AUTHORITIES MAY USE WIRELESS TELEPHONE SUBSCRIBER DATA TO ENROLL RESIDENTS IN THE SYSTEMS AGAIN IT MAINTAINS THE SAME PROTECTIONS. THAT EXIST THAT THESE CAN ONLY BE USED FOR A VERY SPECIFIC AND LIMITED PURPOSE. AND IT ALSO AUTHORIZES COUNTY SOCIAL SERVICE DEPARTMENTS WE LEARN THIS IS WELL. WE LEARNED THIS IN THE PARADISE FAR WE LEARNED THIS IN THE FIRES UP IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE WITH SPECIAL NEEDS WHO NEED TO BE NOTIFIED AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE STAGE. SO THAT EFFORTS CAN BE MADE TO EVACUATE THEM SO THAT THEY DON'T END UP AS VICTIMS AS ONE OF THE HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO PLUS PEOPLE. WHO WERE KILLED DURING THE MOST RECENT FIRES SO? WHEN DISASTER STRIKES COLLEAGUES EMERGENCY OFFICIALS MUST BE ABLE TO NOTIFY RESIDENTS QUICKLY AND EFFECTIVELY? THE MEASURE ALSO SAYS THAT TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS WHO ARE NOW A KEY COMPONENT OF THIS WHOLE SYSTEM. HAVE TO SUPPLY THE P. YOU SEE WITH SPECIFIC DATA REGARDING EMERGENCY MESSAGING PERFORMANCE. ERROR RATES AND THROUGH PORTS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS IT'S AGGREGATED NO ONE'S GOING TO KNOW WHO SPECIFICALLY WHAT COMPANIES DOING WHAT BUT BECAUSE THESE COMPANIES ARE PART. OF THIS WARNING SYSTEM THEY NEED TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT NGUYEN MANY OF THESE A LARGE CAME OUT IN MY DISTRICT. MANY OF MY FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES RECEIVE THE NOTICES AND MANY DID NOT. THE SYSTEM IS NOT PERFECT AND WE MUST IMPROVE IT AND WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. AS I HAVE WITH ME JEFF NORRIS THE EMERGENCY SERVICE COORDINATOR FOR SAN MATTEO COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE AND CHIEF MICHAEL MORRIS FROM CAL STATE UNIVERSITY CHANNEL ISLANDS WHO ARE HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. NOT JUST TO REMIND THE SPEAKERS SAID TWO MINUTES EACH. THANK YOU OFFER THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY MY NAME IS MICHAEL MORRIS AND I SERVE AS THE CHIEF OF POLICE FOR CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY CHANNEL ISLANDS. DURING THE FALL SEMESTER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN CSU CHANNEL ISLANDS COMMUNITY EXPERIENCE THREE SIGNIFICANT EMERGENCY SITUATIONS WITHIN A PERIOD OF ONLY EIGHT DAYS. ON OCTOBER THIRTY FIRST A STUDENT WAS PHYSICALLY ASSAULTED IN A RESTROOM AND ONE OF OUR ACADEMIC BUILDINGS AND THREATENED WITH A HANDGUN. ONLY ONE WEEK LATER THE TRAGIC SHOOTING AT BORDERLINE BAR AND GRILL IN THOUSAND OAKS OCCURRED. AND ALTHOUGH THAT DID NOT OCCUR ON CAMPUS WE KNOW THAT AT LEAST FORTY CHANNEL ISLAND STUDENTS WERE PRESENT. AT THE TIME. THE VERY NEXT DAY NOVEMBER EIGHTH THE HILL FIRE IN THE WILL THE FIREBALL STARTED IN THE AREA WITHIN TWENTY ONE MINUTES OF EACH OTHER. BOTH FIRES ULTIMATELY IMPACTED OUR COMMUNITY BUT THE HILL FIRE FORCED THE IMMEDIATE MANDATORY EVACUATION AND THREE DAY CLOSURE OF THE CHANNEL ISLANDS CAMPUS. WE'RE THANKFUL THAT NONE OF THESE INCIDENTS ACTUALLY RESULTED IN THE LOSS OF LIFE FOR ANY MEMBER OF THE CHANNEL ISLANDS COMMUNITY. PSYCHOLOGICAL TOLL HOWEVER WAS DEVASTATING FOR A COMMUNITY. INTO THESE INCIDENTS BECAME NECESSARY FOR US TO ACTIVATE OUR EMERGENCY NOTIFICATION SYSTEM TO ALERT STUDENTS AND EMPLOYEES OF THE PRESENCE OF DANGER. WE USE A SYSTEM FOR MASS NOTIFICATION WHICH DISTRIBUTES MESSAGES BY MEANS OF EMAIL TELEPHONE CALL AND TEXT MESSAGE. ALL OF OUR STUDENTS AND OUR COMMAND AND EMPLOYEES ARE IN AUTOMATICALLY ENROLLED IN THIS SYSTEM BUT ONLY WITH THEIR CAMPUS EMAIL ADDRESS. THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO OPT IN AND TO VOLUNTARY VOLUNTARILY ADD SUPPLEMENTAL CONTACT INFORMATION TO THE SYSTEM INCLUDING THEIR CELLPHONES. WE STRONGLY ENCOURAGE OUR STUDENTS AND EMPLOYEES TO DO SO TO PROVIDE THE SUPPLEMENTAL CONTACT INFORMATION WE TALK ABOUT IT REGULARLY. AT ORIENTATIONS EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS -- PROGRAMMING SOCIAL MEDIA AND GLOBAL EMAIL MESSAGES BUT FOR WHATEVER REASON MANY PEOPLE JUST DON'T DO IT. FOLLOWING THE THREE INCIDENTS LAST FALL. WE HAD A DEBRIEFING PROCESS INVOLVING PRESIDENT ERICA BACK IN HER LEADERSHIP TEAM. WE DISCUSS THE STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF THE UNIVERSE THESE EMERGENCIES AND THE IMPACT THAT THEY HAD ON OUR COMMUNITY. WE DISCUSSED OUR EXPERIENCES WITH EMERGENCY NOTIFICATION AND THE FACT THAT SO MANY STUDENTS HAVE REPORTED TO US THAT THEY HAD NEVER RECEIVED OUR MESSAGES. WE TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT OUR OWN INFORMATION SYSTEMS USED TO MANAGE ENROLLMENT REGISTRATION IN PERSONNEL RECORDS. ACTUALLY CONTAIN CONTACT INFORMATION FOR STUDENTS AND EMPLOYEES INCLUDING THEIR CELL PHONE NUMBERS BUT THAT THAT INFORMATION IS NOT INCLUDED IN OUR EMERGENCY NOTIFICATION SYSTEM. IT MAKES SENSE TO TAKING A FULL INFORMATION THAT WE ALREADY HAVE BEEN LOADED INTO THE EMERGENCY NOTIFICATION SYSTEM. AND GIVE PEOPLE THE OPPORTUNITY TO OPT OUT OF THAT SYSTEM RATHER THAN TO TRY TO CONVINCE THEM TO OPT IN. DON'T DO IT THAT WAY BECAUSE WE BELIEVE TO BE UNLAWFUL. FOR US TO UTILIZE STUDENTS PHONE NUMBERS FOR THAT PURPOSE WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT. WE BELIEVE THIS BILL WILL BE VERY WILL BE VERY BENEFICIAL FOR OUR CAMPUS. DURING AN EMERGENCY WE KNOW THAT STUDENTS AND EMPLOYEES ARE NOT NECESSARILY GOING TO CHECK THEIR EMAIL FOR INFORMATION AND INSTRUCTIONS. WE ALSO KNOW THAT IN TWENTY NINETEEN EMAILS PROBABLY NOT THE COMMUNICATING WITH THIS GENERATION OF COLLEGE STUDENTS. THEY ARE HOWEVER VERY CONNECTED TO THEIR MOBILE DEVICES WE NEED TO RESET THEY NEED TO RECEIVE A PHONE CALL OR TEXT MESSAGE ON THEIR CELL PHONE. HAVING THE ABILITY TO ALERT OUR STUDENTS AND EMPLOYEES TO THE PRESENCE OF AN EMERGENCY AND TO BE CONFIDENT THAT EVERY PERSON RECEIVED THAT NOTIFICATION IMMEDIATELY IS CRITICAL. THIS BILL WILL HELP TO MAKE THAT POSSIBLE. WE APPRECIATE SENATOR JACKSON FOR INTRODUCING THIS BILL WHICH WE BELIEVE WILL PROVIDE THE TOOLS TO HELP KEEP OUR STUDENTS AND EMPLOYEES SAFE. YOU ALSO HELP OTHER COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES WHO STRUGGLE WITH THE SAME CHALLENGES THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE YOU KEEPING THAT UNDER TWO MINUTES HI I'M NEXT SPEAKER. GOOD MORNING JEFF NORRIS EMERGENCY SERVICES COORDINATOR FOR THE COUNTY OF SAN MATTEO. SENATOR COUNTY HAS BEEN OPERATING AN OPT IN ALERT AND WARNING SYSTEM THE SMC ALERT FOR A LITTLE OVER TEN YEARS NOW AND WE'RE APPROACHING ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND SUBSCRIBERS. OUR RESIDENT POPULATION SAN MATEO COUNTY IS SEVEN HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND PEOPLE SO WE HAVE BARELY AN EIGHTH OF OUR POPULATION UNDER COVERAGE. ON TOP OF THAT WE OPERATE A REVERSE NINE ONE ONE EIGHT TELEPHONE NOTIFICATION SYSTEM THAT CAN DO VOICE CALLS -- THIS SYSTEM WHEN WE MIGRATED SOFTWARE APPROXIMATELY THREE YEARS AGO I MOVED SLIGHTLY OVER SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND TELEPHONE NUMBERS EACH ONE OF THESE TELEPHONE NUMBERS HAD A GEO CODE WHICH RESULTED IN. IT BEING A MARK ON A HOUSE OR RESIDENTS. WHEN I UPDATED THE DATA JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO -- WHICH IS DONE ON A MONTHLY BASIS I HAD SLIGHTLY UNDER FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND I WATCHED A THIRD OF THE AVAILABLE RESIDENCES IN MY COMMUNITY. THAT MAY NEED NOTIFICATION A MAJOR EMERGENCY VANISH IN THE LAST THREE YEARS. WITH THE HELP OF THIS BILL SENATOR JACKSON'S DIRECTION WE WILL BE ABLE TO ENHANCE AND BE ABLE. TO LOCATE THOSE PHONE NUMBERS. IN A CHANGING DYNAMIC. WE SEE A CHANGING COMMUNICATIONS DYNAMIC CONVENTIONAL WIRE LINE TELEPHONES ARE RAPIDLY GOING AWAY REPLACED WITH TECHNOLOGIES LIKE VOICE OVER IP THROUGH CABLE TV. AND PEOPLE WHO ARE STRICTLY ON CELLULAR THESE -- COMMUNICATIONS METHODS THAT WE NOW CANNOT DRAW A CIRCLE ON A MAP AND SEND A MESSAGE. TO WE A IS A MARVELOUS TECHNOLOGY. BUT IT IS A ONE AND DONE STRATEGY WHEN IT SENDS A MESSAGE IF YOUR PHONE IS IN A LOW SIGNAL OR HIGH NOISE AREA. YOU WON'T GET THAT MESSAGE THIS IS PART OF THE REASON WHY MANY PEOPLE ARE NOT RECEIVING WE A MESSAGES WHEN OTHERS WHO ARE WITHIN A FEW HUNDRED YARDS ARE RECEIVING IT. WE STRONGLY HAS EMERGENCY MANAGERS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE STRONGLY HOPE THAT YOU WILL ADVANCE THIS MEASURE BECAUSE THIS WILL HELP US. WE LIKE TO USE THE ACRONYM PLEASE PLAN LEAVE EARLY AND SAVE EVERYONE THAT'S OUR MANTRA FOR EVERY EVACUATION -- SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY I DO WE HAVE ANY OTHERS SPEAKERS AND SUPPORT WE COULD WE CAN DO ME TO USE OVER HERE OFF TO THE SIDE. SEEING NONE IT ANYONE HERE IN OPPOSITION. CAN AS I SHARED EARLIER -- TO SPEAKERS TWO MINUTES -- I'M A GIVE YOU A LITTLE LONGER LEASH BECAUSE THE PROPONENTS WENT OVER SO. IN YOU TAKE THAT IN CONSIDERATION WHEN YOU GIVE YOUR TESTIMONY. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS CENTER JACKSON -- STEVE CARLSON -- CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS CTI A WHERE THE WIRELESS INDUSTRY TRADE ASSOCIATION. THE WIRELESS INDUSTRY PLAYS AN INDISPENSABLE ROLE IN PUBLIC SAFETY FROM DELIVERING OVER 75% OF NINE ONE ONE CALLS TO DOES DISASTER ALERT AND RESPONSE WE'RE VERY PROUD OF HOW WELL IT IS DONE. IN MYRIAD DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES. AS HAS BEEN DISCUSSED WIRELESS EMERGENCY ALERTS -- AND IT'S ALSO DESCRIBED TO VERY WELL IN THE ANALYSIS -- IS A FEDERAL PROGRAM IN WHICH ALL WIRELESS PHONES UP WHEN YOU BUY YOUR PHONE YOUR OPTED IN TO WIRELESS EMERGENCY ALERTS AND YOU HAVE TO OPT OUT OF IT -- WHICH IS ONE OF ITS STRENGTHS. IT'S BY FAR THE MOST ROBUST WARNING SYSTEM -- BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT HASN'T BEEN USED IN SOME RECENT INCIDENTS AND TOO FEW CITIES AND COUNTIES CALLED LOCAL ORIGINATORS. ARE PREPARED TO USE THE SYSTEM. NOTHING'S PERFECT -- WE'RE WORKING ON EXPANDING THE NUMBER OF CHARACTERS TO EXPAND THE YOU KNOW THE THE INFORMATION THAT COMES OUT -- BUT IT IS BY FAR THE BEST. LOCAL EMERGENCY WARNING SYSTEM CERTAINLY CAN PLAY A ROLE IN DISASTER AND WE APPLAUD -- THE WITNESSES AT THE TABLE WHO ARE ARE SO FOCUSED AND AND COMMITTED TO THIS. AND IT TO THE FOCUS OF SB FORTY SIX UNFORTUNATELY RESPECTFULLY WE DO NOT BELIEVE THE BILL IS THE RIGHT WAY TO GO ABOUT ENHANCING THE SYSTEMS. FIRST PART OF THE BILL SIX TO CLARIFY THAT WIRELESS SUBSCRIBER INFORMATION CAN BE -- OPEN TO TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FOR THE PURPOSE OF AND ROLLING RESIDENTS IN A LOCAL EMERGENCY WARNING SYSTEM. EVEN THOUGH IT IS VOLUNTARY ON THE PART LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WE BELIEVE IT RUNS AFOUL OF A. B. THREE SEVENTY FIVE THE CALIFORNIA -- CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT AS ONE FOR MORE FEDERAL LAWS. FURTHER AND EQUALLY IF NOT MORE TROUBLING THE BILL REQUIRES THE COMMISSION TO COLLECT FROM CARRIERS AND REPORT INFORMATION REGARDING THE PERFORMANCE OF AN PLEASE LISTEN TO THIS. LOCAL EMERGENCY WARNING SYSTEM NOT THE FEDERAL SYSTEM THOUGHT THE STUFF WE DO. SO WE'RE SUPPOSED TO REPORT ON WHAT THESE GENTLEMEN DO BUT WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THAT INFORMATION WE DON'T CONTROL IT. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENS IT RUNS OVER OUR REGULAR -- CARRIER NETWORKS SO WE'RE NOT SURE YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THAT HAPPENS -- SO IT ASKING US TO REPORT ON THAT. HAS OTHER ISSUES BUT CERTAINLY IT'S INFORMATION OVER WHICH WE HAVE -- NO CONTROL -- IT ALSO FLIPS THE PRESUMPTION OF CONFIDENTIALITY FOR NETWORK INFORMATION AND NOW TEACHES. ALTERNATED AGREES. THE DISCLOSURE OF THIS INFORMATION CONTRAVENES INDUSTRY BEST PRACTICES. AND FCC STATEMENTS REGARDING THE NEED FOR CONFIDENTIALITY OF THIS DATA. WHICH COULD JEOPARDIZE COMPETITIVELY SENSITIVE INFORMATION CRITICAL COMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE. PROPRIETARY INFORMATION AND TRADE SECRETS. WE BELIEVE THE BEST WAY TO HANDLE THESE ISSUES IS THE WAY WE'VE DONE IT WITH -- YES AN EMERGENCY RESPONDERS AND MANY MANY OTHER SITUATIONS. GET THE RIGHT PEOPLE TO SIT AROUND A TABLE AND WORK THROUGH THE ISSUES. EVEN TODAY WIRELESS CARRIERS ARE WORKING TO FINALIZE A MAN MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING WITH CALLAWAY US. AND WORKING COOPERATIVELY WITH CAL FIRE TO ENSURE THAT INFORMATION FLOWS ON THESE ISSUES ARE PROPERLY TAILORED TO THESE AGENCIES NEEDS. UNFORTUNATELY UNLESS THOSE ISSUES WERE ADDRESSED WITH US RESPECTFULLY CONTINUE TO OPPOSE. THANK YOU MISTER DEVINE MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY. WE OPPOSE THIS BILL UNLESS AMENDED I DO WANT TO COMMEND THE AUTHOR AND THEIR SUPPORTERS TO BRING FORWARD A ROBUST DISCUSSION ABOUT EMERGENCY ALERTS. AND ABOUT THE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIA CITIZENS AS ALL OF YOU KNOW EIGHTEEN ANTI AND THE WIRELESS INDUSTRY IS ON THE FRONTLINE OF EVERY SINGLE EMERGENCY. UNFORTUNATELY THIS PARTICULAR BILL HAS TWO MAJOR PROVISIONS ONE IN SECTION FOUR AND ONE IN SECTION. FIVE THAT WE OBJECT. TO STEVE SPOKE TO THE ISSUE OF A OF THE FACT THAT THE BILL PRESUMES TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS CONTROL THE ALERT SYSTEMS WE DO NOT. WANT ALERT ORIGINATORS SUCH AS A CITY OR A COUNTY SENDS OUT A WIRELESS EMERGENCY ALERT OR ALERTING PHONE CALLS AS WAS MENTIONED IN TERMS OF LAND LINES OR OTHER MESSAGES BY THIRD PARTY APPS. OR THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS WE DO NOT HAVE CONTROL OVER THEIR SYSTEMS. WE DO NOT SEE OR HEAR WHAT THESE MESSAGES SAY WE DO NOT DECIDE WHERE THE MESSAGES GO THEY SELECT THAT AUTOMATICALLY IN THE SYSTEM. AND WE DO NOT RECEIVE A RECEIPT OF WHEN THESE MESSAGES ARE DELIVERED. BY DESIGN BECAUSE IN AN EMERGENCY THE SYSTEM WAS DESIGNED TO AVOID CONGESTION SO THE WIRELESS EMERGENCY ALERT SYSTEM IS DEFINITELY A ONE WAY SYSTEM. THIS IS BECAUSE ALERT ORIGINATORS USE THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE. TO CREATE THESE ALERTS AND DETERMINE WHERE THEY GO. SECOND SB FORTY SIX SEEKS TO IMPOSE P. UC REPORTING REQUIREMENTS THAT WOULD PUBLICLY DISCLOSE. HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION ABOUT NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE AND OPERATIONS [inaudible] TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS ALREADY REPORT NETWORK PERFORMANCE INFORMATION TO BOTH THE P. YOU SEE AND THE FCC. THEY ARE MARKED CONFIDENTIAL AND PROTECTED WHY. BECAUSE IT ADDRESSES CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE FOR HOMELAND SECURITY AND PUBLIC SAFETY YOU DO NOT WANT NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE BEING BROADCAST TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC. SIMPLY PUT SB FORTY SIX IS BUILT BUT THESE TWO SECTIONS ARE ON FALSE PREMISES A THAT WE HAVE THE INFORMATION THAT WE COULD REPORT. AND BE IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO BE PUBLISHING THIS INFORMATION OR FLIPPING THE PRESUMPTION. AT THE P. YOU SEE THAT IT SHOULD BE PUBLIC RATHER THAN PRIVATE. TO THOSE OF THE MAJOR CONCERNS WE HAVE NOW LET ME CLOSE BY SAYING THIS IF YOU LOOK AT THE WHEEL SYSTEM. THE WE IS SYSTEM IS THE ONLY SYSTEM THAT IS AN OPT OUT SYSTEM IN OTHER WORDS. EVERYBODY'S IN UNLESS YOU ACTIVELY TURN WE ARE OFF ON YOUR WIRELESS DEVICE. THERE IS NO DATA AND NO EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT THE WE HAVE SYSTEM HAS FAILED DURING ANY OF THESE EMERGENCIES WHEN IT HAS BEEN USED. LAST YEAR ALL OF YOU SUPPORTED AND WE SUPPORTED A BILL BY SENATOR. MCGUIRE. THAT AND EVERY COMMUNITY CITY COUNTY WHOEVER THE ALERT DOES IGNEOUS SHOULD BE SIGNED UP FOR WE ARE. AND SHOULD HAVE TRAINING ON HOW TO IMPLEMENT WE ARE. IN A DISASTER BECAUSE IT IS THE BEST MOST EFFECTIVE SYSTEM IN FACT THE WE A SYSTEM ACTUALLY CAPTURES YOUR WIRELESS DEVICE IF YOU'RE VISITING AN AREA SO WE DON'T NEED AN ADDRESS. IT INCLUDES EVERY WIRELESS DEVICE WITH YOUR VISITING OR LIVING IN A PARTICULAR AREA. SO IT'S A VERY EFFECTIVE OFTEN AS ONE OF THE WITNESSES JUST TESTIFIED THEY SPENT TEN YEARS TRYING TO COMPILE PHONE NUMBERS AND BARELY HAVE SCRATCHED EIGHTEEN OR 20% OF THE ENTIRE POPULATION. WE ARE IN THAT SAME GEOGRAPHY IS AUTOMATICALLY A 100% AGAIN UNLESS YOU'VE TURNED IT OFF. ARE THE OTHER ISSUE THAT'S BEEN RAISED IS THE ISSUE OF NINETY CHARACTERS OF WE THAT IS WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ADOPTED YEARS AGO BECAUSE IT WAS A LIMITATION ON THE TECHNOLOGY WE ARE NOW EXPLORING AND MOVING FORWARD WITH THE FCC TO EXPAND THOSE MESSAGES TO THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY CHARACTERS. SO THE SYSTEM IS BEING IMPROVED WE'RE INVESTING IN IN MAKING SURE ADDITIONAL. OF CHARACTERS ARE AVAILABLE FOR THESE ALERTS. LET ME JUST CLOSE BY SAYING THIS WE'RE ON THE FRONTLINE OF EVERY DISASTER AND MANY OF YOU. WHO HAD DISASTERS IN YOUR DISTRICT HAS SEEN EIGHTEEN TEA AND OTHER CARRIERS? IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD IN YOUR COMMUNITIES RESPONDING TO THESE DISASTERS BOTH IN THE EARLY ALERT AS WILLING DURING THE DISASTER AS WELL AS AFTER. SO WE EMBRACE WHAT SENATOR HANNAH BETH JACKSON IS ATTEMPTING TO DO HERE WE BELIEVE THERE SOME LIMITATIONS IN SECTION FOUR AND FIVE THAT NEED TO BE CORRECTED. AND WE WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE AND WITH THE AUTHOR TO IMPROVE THE BILL AND MOVE FORWARD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU ANY OTHER. SPEAKERS IN SUPPORT WE CAN MEET TO IT OFF HERE TO THE LEFT. MAIN OPPOSITION SORRY THANK YOU. I HAVEN'T DONE IT IN HERE OKAY SAYING -- NINE PULL IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS CONCERNS WILL OPEN WITH SENATOR NIELSEN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN IN CENTER JACKSON I'M VERY DELIGHTED TO BE A CO AUTHOR WITH YOU ON THIS LEGISLATION. THE AREAS THAT I PRIVILEGE REPRESENT HAVE REGULARLY BEEN VISITED WITH THE GREAT DISASTERS AND LIST LAST YEAR ONE OF THE GREATEST. IN HISTORY. I DO I DO BUT THERE APPEARED TO BE SOME UNANTICIPATED. CONSEQUENCES ARE FACTORS HERE. AND I WANT TO THANK YOU AND YOUR STAFF THAT BEEN VERY COOPERATIVE IN WORKING THE ENTERTAINING SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE RAISED. ABOUT THE IT TYPICALLY THE HAS A RESPONSIBILITY SHIFTING -- TO YES AS OPPOSED TO PAY YOU SEE IS DESIGNED BUILT AND WELL PRACTICED IN DEALING WITH SUCH MATTERS OF P. USUALLY IS NOT IT'S A DIFFERENT KIND OF AUTHORITY. AND I THINK THAT BE GREAT CONFUSION. SEATING RESPONSIBILITY THEM BUT THANK YOU FOR BEING WILLING TO WORK WITH THAT AND THEN OF-COURSE PROPRIETY OR AND INFORMATION IS REALLY CRITICAL. AND YOU'VE INDICATED THAT YOU WORK WITH US IN THE FUTURE AS WE PROCEED AND I THANK YOU. FOR THE WILLINGNESS TO DO THAT I BELIEVE THAT IT CERTAINLY WILL IMPROVE. CERTAINLY THERE'S NO QUESTION AND ONE OF THE PHENOMENA LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THAT'S THE EXTENT TODAY. IS HOW RAPIDLY SOME DISASTERS LIKE FIRES. CAN ENVELOP US. QUITE LITERALLY. IT IS STUNNING. ENHANCE OUR ABILITY TO REACH AS MANY PEOPLE AS DIRECTLY AS POSSIBLE. THIS -- NECESSARY AND THAT'S THE DIRECTION THAT YOU'RE TAKING. AND I DO APPRECIATE THAT. I WOULD LOVE SO LIKE TO PUBLICLY THANK SINCE MISTER DEVINE IS HERE OF AT AND T.. AND OTHER MATTERS IN THE AREA THAT I REPRESENT AT AND T. HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY IMMEDIATE. AND THOROUGHLY HELPFUL IN ADDRESSING SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE'VE HAD. ABOUT NOTIFICATION. BACK TO THE BILL I THANK YOU FOR YOUR COOPERATION AND WILLINGNESS TO ENTERTAIN AMENDMENTS AND SEE AS THE BILL PROGRESSES THAT SOME OF THE ISSUES RAISED HERE CAN BE ADDRESSED THANK YOU. ANYBODY ELSE CENTER ARCHULETA. YES. ONCE AGAIN SENATOR JIM ED YOU'VE DONE AN EXCELLENT JOB AND I APPRECIATE. WHICH AT THE I'VE I'VE GOT COLLEGES IN IN MY AREA AND AND OF COURSE THE SHOOTINGS IN. GOD FORBID WHAT WHAT COULD HAPPEN IN YOUR AREAS FIRES AND SO ON BUT BUT AND I'M WORKING TOGETHER WITH THE OPPOSITION DISSEMINATING THE INFORMATION IN IN THE NUMBER SIX I SEE THE THE INFORMATION CAN BE AND ON THE WEBSITE. IS THAT NECESSARY AND CAN WE HOW CAN WE WORK AROUND THAT WELL THE GOAL AS THE BILL'S INDICATES THAT THE INFORMATION IS AGGREGATED SO THE DESIGN IS NOT TO EXPOSE ANY COMPANY. OR ANY SPECIFIC AREA TO POTENTIAL. THREAT. THE GOAL IS TO TRY TO MAKE THE SYSTEM WORK BETTER AND SO THE ACCOUNTABILITY ASPECTS OF REALLY WITHIN THE SYSTEM ITSELF AND NOT ANY PARTICULAR COMPANY OR ANY PARTICULAR LOCATION SO I'M. COURSE HAPPY TO CONTINUE WORKING TO ACHIEVE THAT GOAL BECAUSE THE GOAL IS TO HAVE REDUNDANCY TO HAVE AS MANY DIFFERENTWAYS TO WARN PEOPLE AS WE CAN TO MAKE IT AS ACCURATE AS POSSIBLE AND TO MAKE SURE IT'S CONSISTENT SO THAT. WHEN SOME PEOPLE GET A LOCAL WARNING AND SOME PEOPLE DON'T WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHY THAT IS THAT THAT ISN'T HAPPENING? BY AGGREGATING THE INFORMATION NOT DESEGREGAING WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE IDENTIFYING A PARTICULAR COMPANY OR PROCESS THAT MAY BE -- IN NEED OF IMPROVEMENT IT'S THE OVERALL VIEW OF HOW WE MAKE THE SYSTEM BETTER SO WE CAN HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION ON THAT -- AS FAR AS THE ONE OTHER. QUESTION ON WEBSITE AND THE WEBSITE RIGHT -- AGAIN THE INFORMATION IS NOT. SUPPOSED TO BE SPECIFIC. SO THAT IT COULD BE USED IN AN ADVERSE WAY -- BY. TERRORISTS OR WHAT OTHER OPPORTUNITIES MIGHT EXIST IN TODAY'S TECHNOLOGY WORLD OR IN VIOLATION OF PRIVACY ISSUE SO AGAIN HAPPY TO CONTINUE WORKING ON THAT. THE GOAL IS TO GET REDUNDANCY. THERE WAS MANY DIFFERENT OPTIONS AS POSSIBLE TO MAKE THEM CONSISTENT TO MAKE THEM AFFECT THEM TO MAKE THEM. AS EARLY AND AS CLEAR AS POSSIBLE SO THAT PEOPLE CAN RESPOND AND BE SAFE THAT IS THE GOAL SO AGAIN I'M HAPPY TO CONTINUE WORKING ON THAT AS WELL THANK YOU [inaudible] CENTER BARGES. THE VICE CHAIRMAN. OF I THINK YOU ALREADY ADDRESSED -- MOST OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE POSED TO YOU BUT I FEEL OBLIGATED BECAUSE THERE WERE SOME FAIRLY COMPELLING POINTS ON THAT WERE BROUGHT UP BY AN OF FOLKS THAT -- HAD CONCERNS WITH IF. SECTIONS FOUR AND FIVE WERE REVISED TO THEIR SATISFACTION WITH THIS STILL IN YOUR OPINION. MOVE -- THIS -- SAFETY SYSTEM -- TOWARD -- IMPROVED VIABLE STATE. WELL IT'S HARD TO SAY WHAT THE FINAL SATISFACTION ELEMENT IS SO I CAN CERTAINLY COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THEM TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES THAT WERE ARTICULATED ONE OF THEM. THE P. YOU SEE VERSUS THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES RIGHT NOW NOBODY THAT I KNOW WAS PARTICULARLY HIGH ON THE PC SO THAT MAY VERY WELL BE. AN AVENUE TO PURSUE I'VE NO PROBLEM HAVING THOSE DISCUSSIONS AND SO LONG AS WE'RE ALL WORKING IN GOOD FAITH I THINK WE CAN COME UP WITH A SOLUTION HERE AGAIN MY GOAL. IS REPETITIVE SYSTEMS THAT ARE GOING TO REACH EVERYBODY AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE GIVE THEM THE NECESSARY INFORMATION WE A IT IS A GREAT SYSTEM BUT IT ONLY SEE IT IT DOESN'T MEET ALL OF THE NEEDS. AND AND SO WE NEED TO HAVE. A BETTER MORE ROBUST WIRELESS THE OPPOSITION TO MAKE IT MORE ROBUST AND ALSO TO DEAL WITH THE CONCERNS. THAT THEY HAVE ABOUT THE OR THAT WERE ARTICULATED HERE TODAY OVER THOSE SECTIONS MAYBE I'LL POSE MY QUESTION TO MR DEVINE YOU BROUGHT UP BUT AS YOUR THIRD POINT -- CONFIDENTIALITY MAINTAINING. THE INTEGRITY OF PROPRIETARY INFORMATION OR NATIONAL SECURITY CONCERNS WITHIN THE GRID THE FRAMEWORK OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS -- CAN YOU EXPAND A LITTLE BIT ON HOW YOU WOULD WORK WITH -- THE MAKER OF THIS ITEM TO PROTECT ALL INFORMATION THAT YOU DEEM SENSITIVE. FIRST OFF WE'D BE DELIGHTED TO WORK WITH THE SENATOR ON THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE. AND THE IT WE ALREADY HAVE TODAY PRACTICE WITH -- AGENCIES WHERE THEY DO ASK FOR AND DO RECEIVE HIGHLY PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HOMELAND SECURITY AND NETWORK SECURITY ISSUES THAT WE PROVIDE TO THE STATE GOVERNMENT WOULD MAKE THOSE REPORTS AVAILABLE. AND THEY'RE KEPT CONFIDENTIAL AND THAT IS HONORED AND AS LONG AS THAT'S BUILT INTO THE BILL -- THAT WOULD ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS. HOWEVER I IF I MAY MISTER CHAIRMAN ONE OTHER OBSERVATION. THE DATA THIS BILL ASKS FOR ESOS TO GIVE WHETHER IT'S TO P. YOU SEE HERE -- YES AND BY THE WAY THANK YOU FOR CAN. WE DO NOT WORTH THE DISCUSSION. WE DO NOT HAVE THE DATA. WE DO NOT HAVE THE DATA. IT IS INITIATED BY LOCAL RESPONDERS. CITIES COUNTIES OR DESIGNEES. SO WHEN THAT DATA GOES ACROSS THE NETWORK. WE HAVEN'T TOUCHED IT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT SENSE. WE DON'T WE DON'T WE DON'T HAVE ANY DATA THAT WE COULD SUBMIT HERE SO THE CONCERN WE HAVE IS A STATUTE REQUIRING US TO GIVES GOVERNMENT DATA. WHEN IN FACT WE DON'T COLLECT THE DATA? SO THAT IS A FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE THAT -- AND I MIGHT ADD THAT WAS THE OTHER THING IS THE FACT THAT THE SYSTEM WORKS PRETTY DARN WELL AND ALERTS DO GO OUT. AND LET ME STOP THERE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ARE -- ALL THE ALL THE ALL FINISH WITH THIS THAT -- FROM NINETEEN THE THREE SIXTY WHICH I THINK MAY HAVE -- ADDRESS ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT THE MAKER THE ITEM HAD PUT FORWARD AND ON NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION. THE RESPONSIVENESS IN THE ABILITY TO RESPOND THAT'S TO BE DETERMINED BUT ULTIMATELY. I WANNA MAKE CERTAIN THAT -- BY WILL TO ME BY WAY OF BACKGROUND IN MY PREVIOUS CAPACITY IS SUPERVISOR WE ARE SHOOTING A DOWNTOWN FRESNO. AND I WAS -- TASKED WITH THE CREATING EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS PROTOCOLS WITHIN THE COUNTING I WAS FLABBERGASTED. AND HOW ILL EQUIPPED WE WERE TO HANDLE A SITUATION LIKE THAT. AND IMMEDIATELY BEGAN INSTITUTING -- REFORMS ON DONE TOWARD IMPROVING THAT. PUBLIC AS WELL AS EMPLOYEE SAFETY -- SO I APPRECIATE THE MAKER THIS ITEM MOVING THIS FORWARD I THINK. GIVEN WHAT WE'VE EXPERIENCED THIS IS THE RIGHT PATH AS LONG AS WE FIND A WAY THAT PROTECTS INFORMATION THAT CREATES PREPARE THE DOES NOT UNFAIRLY CREE PRESUMPTIONS WITHIN THE INDUSTRY. ALL THAT CAN BE WORKED AROUND THEN I THINK THERE'S A PATH FORWARD AS LONG AS THE PREVAILING PARTIES -- COME TO AGREEMENT [inaudible] BETTER GALGIANI. I HAD A COMMENT AND THEN I HAD A QUESTION IN MY OWN HOME COUNTY I RECEIVE AN EMERGENCY TEXT ALERT AND I ALSO RECEIVE AN EMAIL. AND I THINK IT WORKS WONDERFUL WHEN I'M OUT ON MISTER DEVINE MENTIONED THAT THAT WE A SYSTEM HAS A CAPTURE THE CAPTURE YOUR WIRELESS DEVICE EVEN WHEN YOU'RE VISITING AN AREA. I WAS WITH SENATOR NIELSEN IN PARADISE SHORTLY AFTER THE FIRES WHEN THEY HAD THE FLOOD WATCH WARNING. AND I RECEIVED AN ALERT I ASSUMED IT WAS A TAXED AND SO I WENT TO OPEN IT AND IT DISAPPEARED. I THINK IT DISAPPEARED AND THEN I I GOT ANOTHER ALERT ON MY OTHER CELL PHONE I COULD HEAR THAT OTHER MEMBERS WHO ARE VISITING -- ALSO STARTED GETTING ALL OF THEIR OTHER TO THE SAME TIME. MY QUESTION IS WHEN YOU REFER TO THE ONE AND DONE. IS THAT WHEN IT'S AN ALERT ON YOUR CELL PHONE AND THEN IT GOES AWAY WHAT IS ONE AND DONE. IF I USE THAT LANGUAGE -- I THINK IT WAS -- IT WAS SOMEBODY ELSE. IN TERMS OF THE ONE AND DONE TYPE MESSAGE WE ARE MESSAGES ARE TRANSMITTED ONCE BY THE CARRIERS THEY DO A VERY GOOD JOB OF THIS AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THE PHONES ARE RECEIVING THE SIGNAL CORRECTLY. THOSE MESSAGES COME UP. VERY QUICLY. THEY APPEAR ON THE DISPLAY SCREEN. HOWEVER AS YOU DISCOVERED WHEN YOU TRIED TO OPEN THE MESSAGE THINKING IT WAS A CONVENTIONAL TAXED IT CLEARED IT FROM THE DEVICES MEMORY. THE DEVICES DO NOT SAVE THESE MESSAGES AND THAT'S WHERE THE THE COLLOQUIALISM ONE AND DONE HAS COME TO REFER TO WE A MESSAGES. I SEE SO I WAS RIGHT ABOUT THAT -- I CAN SEE WHERE I DON'T KNOW IF THIS BILL IS GOING TO ADDRESS THAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE SCIENCE WELL ENOUGH BUT I WOULD THINK THAT. A LIKE IN MY TO HERE IS THE TEXT WHERE YOU CAN ACTUALLY OPEN IT AND SEE IT. FOR ME IT WENT AWAY SO FAST THAT I WASN'T SURE WHAT IT WAS SO -- ANYWAY THANK YOU FOR CLARIFYING THAT [inaudible] SENATOR ALLEN. YEAH AND I BY POTS AS IF THIS IS BEEN RAISED BEFORE I'M IN RESPECT FOR THE AD WITH NATURIST OR SAYS. I NOTICED IN THE OPPOSITION. PIECE OF THE NOW SAYS A TALKED ABOUT DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE FOUNDIN THIS BILL CONTRAVENE CLEAR FEDERAL GUIDANCE. ON THE PRISON CONFIDENTIALITY THAT INFORMATION. AS WELL AS INDUSTRY BACK BEST PRACTICES AND I WANTED TO KIND OF ASK EVERYBODY ABOUT THE FEDERALISM ISSUES HERE THE POTENTIAL TENSION BETWEEN THIS BILL AND FEDERAL LAW AND GET. PERSPECTIVES ON THAT. I DON'T THINK THERE THERE IS A IS A FEDERAL ISSUE HERE -- OF CONCERN WE ARE TRYING AND WE'VE WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING THIS THAT THE GOAL IS TO AGGREGATE THE INFORMATION SO THAT THERE'S NO. ABILITY TO AYE TO SPEAK TO IDENTIFY WITH SPECIFICITY THE COMPANY WHERE THE PROBLEM IS TO IT ANYTHING THAT'S GOING UNDERMINE ISSUES OF GENUINE NATIONAL CONCERTS. CONCERN OR NATIONAL SECURITY THAT'S WHY TO AGGREGATED AND WE'RE CERTAINLY HAPPY TO KEEP WORKING. WITH THE OPPOSITION TO TO CREATE. THE ASSURANCES OR TO CREATE A SYSTEM OF THIS INFORMATION IS EACH ASCERTAINABLE. FOR PURPOSES THAT WOULD IN ANY WAY DAMAGE THE COMPANY ITSELF -- OR NATIONAL SECURITY THE GOAL IS. AGAIN REDUNDANCY HERE THE GOAL IS TO HAVE AS MANY DIFFERENT WAYS TO WARN PEOPLE AS A POSSIBLE -- AND IT AT THE SAME TIME TO PROTECT THE VARIOUS SYSTEMS THAT EXISTS NO ONE WANTS UNDERMINE THE SYSTEMS WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SYSTEMS ARE WORKING. AS BEST AS THEY CAN AND THAT'S WHY I'M GETTING THIS GENERAL DATA TO SEE WHY IT IS THAT SOME PEOPLE GET THE MESSAGES AND SOME PEOPLE DO NOT AND THAT IS A FACT. SO TO IMPROVE THE SYSTEM -- WORKING WITH THE THE VARIOUS WIRELESS COMPANIES WHO IN TODAY'S WORLD ARE REALLY BECOMING MORE AND MORE A CRITICAL PLAYER IN THIS WARNING SYSTEM TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC THAT'S THE GOAL THAT SORT OF THE DYNAMIC WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND I THINK. AGAIN HAPPY TO KEEP CONTINUE WORKING ON THIS -- TO ACHIEVE THAT GOAL. OKAY RISK CROSSING IN THE CHURCH HERE YEAH -- A COUPLE THINGS -- ON THE FEDERAL ISSUE IT IS OUR UNDERSTANDING AND WE SHOULD ALL LOOK AT IT MORE CLOSELY THAT THE FEDERAL STORED COMMUNICATIONS ACT WHICH USC CHAPTER. ONE TWENTY ONE TWENTY SEVEN A ONE TO TWENTY SEVEN TWELVE PROHIBITS WIRELESS CARRIERS FROM DISCLOSING CUSTOMER INFORMATION INCLUDING NAMES ADDRESSES AND PHONE NUMBERS TO ANY GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY. WITHOUT APPROPRIATE LEGAL PROCESS AND THAT ACTUALLY THE BASIS OF THAT. IS -- WAY AND LAW ENFORCEMENT ONCE YOU KNOW IT'S SORT OF LIKE THE TV SHOWS THAT THAT'S NOT THE WAY IT HAPPENS -- YOU KNOW JUST SAY WHAT TYPE I CAN PAYING HIM SO IF YOU'RE GONNA THE THE SOMEBODY HAS A HAS BEEN A KIDNAP. AND THE LAW ENFORCEMENT SAYS OKAY I WANT THAT NUMBER TO PAYING IT -- ONLY AN EXIGENCY ARKHAM STANCES CAN THEY GET THAT NUMBER WITHOUT LEGAL PROCESS SO THAT'S OUR WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT. THAT KIND OF A POPPING UP AGAINST THAT CENTER JACKSON WELL I APPRECIATE THAT BUT AGAIN. THE THE BILL IS VERY SPECIFIC AS TO THE LIMITATIONS OF THE USE OF THIS INFORMATION ONLY FOR EMERGENCY PURPOSES AND I WOULD. ARGUE THAT LEGAL PROCESS IS PASSING LEGISLATION THAT CREATES THAT ABILITY BUT LIMITED BECAUSE I THINK THE CONCERNS HAVE TO DO WITH WHETHER OR NOT THAT INFORMATION IS GOING TO BE USED. FOR OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT REQUIREMENTS AND NACHOS FOR THE LIMITED PURPOSE LAW ENFORCEMENT IS TASKED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO DO THAT FIRST RESPONSE. IN CASES OF EMERGENCY THAT IS THEIR JOB. AND THIS LEGISLATION SPECIFIES AND LIMITS THEIR ABILITY TO USE THAT INFORMATION TO OUR WHICH MAYBE IT'S MAYBE IT'S A GOOD COURT CASE WILL HAVE SOME FUN OVERNIGHT. I THINK RIGHT NOW THAT THAT IS THE LIMITATION A AND IT'S VERY SPECIFIC. AS TO WHAT CAN BE DONE WITH IT I THINK THE LEGAL PROCESS ARE TALKING ABOUT IS A SEARCH WARRANT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT -- THAT MAY BE AND THAT'S WHY C. ALERTS WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT SERVING PROCESS SERVING A WARRANT MAKING AN ARREST. IT'S SIMPLY TO DEAL WITH THIS ONE SPECIFIC RESPONSIBILITY THAT pCALIFORNIA GIVEN TO LAW ENFORCEMENT. WHETHER IT'S A THE VICTIM SENDING OUT THAT GETTING THAT INFORMATION AND AGAIN -- THIS MAY BE A PHILOSOPHICAL DISCUSSION BUT I THINK GIVEN THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND WE ALREADY DID THIS WITH THIS BE A TWENTY ONE AND I DON'T THINK WE'VE SEEN ANY LAWSUITS THUS FAR. I SUSPECT THAT NO ONE REALLY WANTS TO BRING THOSE LOSSES BECAUSE YOU KNOW EIGHTEEN T. AND AND ALL OF THESE WIRELESS COMPANIES THEY DO BUSINESS HERE CALIFORNIA THEY MAKE A LOT OF MONEY HERE IN CALIFORNIA THEY SERVE THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. AND I WOULD THINK THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THEY WOULD WANT TO PERFECT. IN ORDER TO PROTECT THOSE CUSTOMERS IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE COMMUNITIES THAT PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT INCOME TO THE COMPANIES GO THROUGH OUT SO I I I SEE THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO ALL WORK TOGETHER. TO PROTECT THOSE CONCERNS THAT THE COMPANIES MIGHT HAVE ABOUT TRADE SECRETS OR OTHER THINGS OF THAT SORT WHICH WERE HAPPY TO DO. BUT TO TO TRY TO IMPROVE OUR WARNING SYSTEMS TO PROTECT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY THE PEOPLE OF OUR STATE. OUR MISTER MISTER DEVINE DID YOU WANT TO WEIGH IN ON THIS UP I JUST WANTED TO ANSWER THE OTHER HALF OF OF SENATOR ALLEN'S QUESTION IF YOU LOOK AT PAGE NINE SECTION FOR THE BILL. PARAGRAPH FEE IT GOES ON TO READ FOR PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION THE COMMISSION MAY REQUIRE A TELECOM PROVIDER TO COLLECT AND FORWARD TO THE COMMISSION ANY RELEVANT INFORMATION. AND PURSUANT TO EXISTING AUTHORITY MAKE THIS INFORMATION PUBLIC. EXCEPT THE INFORMATION GENERATED OR OBTAINED PURSUANT TO SUBDIVISION BE EXTRA SO IT GIVES THE COMMISSION THE AUTHORITY AUTOMATIC AUTHORITY TO DECIDE THE INFORMATION WE SUBMIT IS PUBLIC. UNLESS WE CAN PERSUADE THEM. THAT IT SHOULD REMAIN CONFIDENTIAL THAT IS A REVERSE OF THE HISTORY THAT HAS EXISTED FOR THIS INDUSTRY. AND PARTICULARLY AROUND HOMELAND SECURITY AND NETWORK SECURITY ISSUES AT THE COMMISSION IT IS ALWAYS CONFIDENTIAL AND IT THEY WOULD HAVE TO AFFIRMATIVELY TAKE A VOTE TO REMOVE THAT CONFIDENTIALITY IN THIS INSTANCE IT'S AUTOMATICALLY PUBLIC WHEN YOU SUBMIT IT. AND THEY WOULD HAVE TO ACTIVELY MAKE IT CONFIDENTIAL AFTER THE FACT SO THAT IS OUR CONCERN ON THE RELEASE OF NETWORK INFORMATION WHETHER IT'S THE P. UC OR CALLAWAY S.. IF I MIGHT JUST SAY IT. IT'S SPECIFICALLY SECURITY INFORMATION IS EXCLUDED FROM ANY PUBLIC. INFORMATION AND AGAIN HAPPY TO CONTINUE. ON THIS ISSUE WE THESE CONCERNS MUCH APPRECIATED -- HAVE HAVEN'T BEEN VETTED. BUT AGAIN THE BASIC PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS TO IMPROVE THE SYSTEMS IT'S TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ABLE TO CREATE THAT. REDUNDANCY TO BETTER TARGET. BECAUSE WE A DOZEN TO THAT AS WELL. AND TO PROVIDE THE OPPORTUNITY TO INNER ACT. IN OTHERWISE BE MORE PREPARED TO RESPOND TO THESE EMERGENCY SO WE WILL ARE I'M HAPPY TO KEEP WORKING ON THIS ISSUE -- I DON'T WANT TO SEE ROAD BLOCK AFTER ROADBLOCK AFTER WORLD BLOCK I DON'T THINK WE WILL BECAUSE AS I MENTIONED I THINK THAT THE WIRELESS COMPANIES RECOGNIZE THEY DO HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA AND IN THAT SPIRIT. OF WORKING TOGETHER -- I WHICH IS SIMPLY CLOSE AND AND LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK ON THE ISSUE. YOU HAVE A FOLLOW UP SENATOR ALLEN ARE TIGHT I IT IS KIND OF AND THE DIE I LOVE SEEING THE KIND OF THE THE THE MIX OF PLAYERS -- IN IN NEW YORK STRONG SUPPORT OF BIG DATA COLLECTION -- FROM THE TECH INDUSTRY SO EVENT BUT IT BUT IT'S BEEN A IT I UNDERSTAND WHY YOU'RE DOING IT I'M IS THERE'S A THERE'S A THERE'S A PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUE HERE BUT THEY'RE ALSO OUR SERIES OF PRIVACY ISSUES THAT YOU KNOW IN THOSE WELL AND THOSE ADDRESS. BUT I KNOW YOUR PASSION ABOUT THEIR SPECIFIC A TWENTY ONE SPECIFICALLY LIMITS THIS INFORMATION FOR EMERGENCY NOTIFICATION ONLY WHEN THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THE COMMUNITY IS AT RISK. RAN THIS INFORMATION SHOULD BE COLLECTED BUT ONLY FOR THAT PURPOSE AND I HOPEFULLY YOU MAKE THAT IF WE CAN MAKE THAT DISTINCTION WHETHER TECH COMPANIES ARE SELLING INFORMATION ABOUT THE THE TIME. THE THE OVULATION CYCLES OF WOMEN IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN WHETHER OR NOT WE'RE GOING TO LET PEOPLE KNOW THEY GOT TO GET OUT. AND WHERE THEY NEED TO GO TO GET OUT OF HARM'S WAY BUT ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT CAME UP AT ARE YOU JUDICIARY HEARING WAS NOT JUST THE THIRD THE COGNIZANT. SELLING OF INFORMATION BUT THE VULNERABILITY. OF A LOT OF THESE COMPANIES TO HACKING AND AND AND AND THE AND THE REST. AND SO -- YOU WE CAN BE VERY SPECIFIC ABOUT PUTTING IN RULES THAT WOULD PREVENT THEM FROM SELLING INFORMATION HI BUT BUT THERE'S ALSO. KIND OF SECURITY ISSUES INVOLVING. NUMBER BACKING VULNERABILITIES THAT ARE OUT THERE SO. AS ANOTHER -- IS ANOTHER CONCERN THAT I KNOW YOU CARE ABOUT I MEAN I THIS IS THIS IS WHAT MAKES THIS WORK SO INTERESTING. HI I'M SURE WE CAN CAN DISCUSS THOSE AS WELL IT'S NOT AN ISSUE I'VE HEARD HERE IT'S NOT AN ISSUE THAT WE'VE HEARD FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT AT THIS POINT IN TIME -- I GUESS ANYTHING COULD BE HACKED AND THAT IS A SERIOUS CONCERN BUT AT THIS POINT TIME WE'RE FOCUSING ON WHAT TO DO TO GIVE GREATER WARNINGS TO PEOPLE IN EMERGENCIES WE KEEP SEEING THEM THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN YOUR DISTRICT AS WELL. AND WHAT DO WE DO TO GIVE PEOPLE A CHANCE TO GET OUT SAFELY SO THAT THEY'RE NOT ANOTHER ONE OF THE STATISTICS OF THE HUNDRED OVER HUNDRED TWENTY PEOPLE WERE KILLED IN THESE FIRES THE TWENTY THREE PEOPLE KILLED IN MY DISTRICT FROM THE DEBRIS FLOW THAT OCCURRED. RIGHT AFTER FIR AND IT GOES ON AND ON CHANGES WE SEE THE INTENSITY OF THE WEATHER PATTERNS CREATING GREATER AND GREATER RISK TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA WE'VE GOT A STEP UP. IN THIS IS ONE OF THE WAYS THAT WE CAN DO THAT AND SO AGAIN WORKING TO CREATE THE PROTECTIONS WE NEED WHILE AT THE SAME TIME PROTECTING. A LEGITIMATE CONCERNS OF INDUSTRY ARE PART OF WHAT WE'RE HOPING TO ACCOMPLISH HERE. I WHICH I SENATOR RUBIO FOLLOWED BY SENATOR HILL. THANK YOU TERMS ARE WILL FIRST OF ALL LET ME THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING UP THIS VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE CLEARLY YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE PASSIONATE ABOUT AND I AM AWARE OF ALL THAT A TRAGEDY THAT OCCURRED IN YOUR COMMUNITY SO I CAN SEE THE PASSION FOR IT. BUT I DO ALONG THE LINES OF MISTER ALLEN I DO SEE A LITTLE BIT OF DISCONNECT IN TERMS OF THE ISSUES RAISED HERE AND THE ABILITY FOR THE COMPANIES TO COLLECTED DATA IF I HEARD MR DOING CORRECTLY THREE THREE TIMES THEY DO NOT COLLECT. DATA DIRECTLY AND SELL I JUST HOPE THAT AND I THINK I HEARD YOU SAY THAT YOU HAVE THE WILLINGNESS TO IN GOOD FAITH SIT DOWN AND FIGURE OUT THOSE. THOSE ISSUES BECAUSE WE DO HAVE TO STEP UP BUT WE HAVE TO DO IT RIGHT AND SO I APPRECIATE YOU WILL NEED TO SIT DOWN WITH THE OPPOSITION THANK YOU. THINK WHICH ARE. THANK YOU SIR RUBIO SENATOR HILL. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR FUTURE AND AND IT'S WE CAN I'VE HAD. LONG DISCUSSIONS OVER THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF MATERIAL OF OF OF INFORMATION AT THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION ESPECIALLY. AND AS WE'VE SEEN HISTORICALLY IT IS. SPECIFIED IS CONFIDENTIAL AND LET'S AND THEN IT GOES TO THE WITH. THE PROBLEM THAT WE'VE HAD WITH THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION IS GETTING THE INFORMATION BECAUSE IT IS ALL CONFIDENTIAL AND THERE'S SOME VERY STRICT RULES AROUND RELATION OF THAT. I THINK IT MAY BE TIME TO CHANGE THAT AND ALLOW INFORMATION TO BE -- NON CONFIDENTIAL UNLESS IT CAN BE SHOWN AND PROVED THAT IT SHOULD BE CONFIDENTIAL I THINK IT MAY BE TIME TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION THE FUTURE GOING TO REVERSE THAT PARADIGM. THAT WE'VE SEEN AT THE P. YOU SEE BECAUSE IT IS -- IT'S IT. IT'S BEEN PROBLEMATIC IN A NUMBER OF AREAS SO IF TO STOP IT THAT'S FOR TIME FOR CONVERSATION FOR ANOTHER DAY. BUT TO THANK YOU MISTER TO FIND THANK YOU FOR THE LEGISLATION. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS CONCERNS [inaudible] BOB JUST. I'M GONNA GIVE YOU MY VOTE TODAY. AS YOU KNOW I LIVE IN A WILD FIRE AREA JUST LIKE YOU AND WE NEED TO PROTECT OUR OUR CONSTITUENTS. OTHERS SEEMS TO BE SOME SOME HURDLES FEET ACROSS AND YOU'VE MADE A PLEASURE TODAY TO WORK WITH OPPOSITION AND HOPEFULLY WE COME UP WITH THE SYSTEM THAT THAT. PROTECTS ALL SO WITH THAT PLEASE CLOSE HEARING OPPORTUNITY -- PART OF THE WHOLE INTERESTING PROCESS WE HAVE IS THEY'LL BE A NUMBER OF STEPS TO BE TAKEN THIS IS THE FIRST I'M HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION AGAIN THE GOAL I THINK IT'S CLEAR I THINK WE FULLY ALL AGREE THAT IT'S AN IMPORTANT. ONE SOMETIMES THE DEVIL'S IN THE DETAILS AND I'M VERY HAPPY TO KEEP WORKING ON THOSE DETAILS. WE HAVE A MOTION [inaudible] NEW APPROVED. A MOVE BY CENTER GALGIANI SO THE MOTION IS TO PASS AND REFERRED TO RULES TO BE RE REFER TO ENERGY AND UTILITY TELLY SENT OUT I THINK MANY OF THE ISSUES THAT WERE BROUGHT UP HERE WILL BE DISCUSSED IN THAT NEXT COMMITTEE. FILE ITEM THREE SB FORTY SIX MOTION IS TO PASS TO RULES COMMITTEE DODD. WILK HI WELL I ALLEN. ARCHULETA ARCHULETA I'D FORGES BRADFORD [inaudible] CHIANG [inaudible] GALGIANI. GALGIANI AYE GLAZER [inaudible] HILL. HELLO I WAS SO [inaudible] JONES [inaudible] NIELSEN. NIELSEN AYE PORTANTINO. RUBIO AYE RUBIO AYE WIENER WIENER AYE. SEVEN KEEP IT UP. YES SEVEN VOTE SO WE WILL KEEP IT OPEN FOR OTHER MEMBERS TO ADD ON THANK YOU CENTER WORLD THANK YOU MEMBERS. NOW WE'RE GONNA GO TO FILE ITEM FIVE SENATOR WIENER. SB [inaudible] FIFTY EIGHT RIGHT. THE LAKERS Là. TWO HEY HOW ARE OKAY [inaudible] THANK. YEAH. SO BEFORE WE START DO YOU I BELIEVE YOU HAVE FOUR SPEAKERS. AT TWO THIRTY YOU GOT IT YOU HAVE TO OKAY. BECAUSE I THOUGHT WE SIGNED OFF ON FOR BUT THAT'S FINE TUESDAY. WE HAVE TWO CHOICES GOOD. ALL I SEE OKAY WELL CENTER WIENER PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOU FOR THERE WILL BE A COUPLE OF OPPOSITION SPEAKERS IN FRONT OF THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIRMAN COLLEAGUES -- FOR HEARING THIS BILL TODAY SENATE BILL -- FIFTY EIGHT I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE. FOR OUR WORKING WITH MY OFFICE AND WE'RE HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES PROPOSE THE BILL -- COLLEAGUES SENATE BILL. FIFTY EIGHT IS A LOCAL CONTROL BILL -- IT GIVES LOCAL. A COMMUNITIES THE ABILITY TO DECIDE FOR THEMSELVES. WHETHER TO EXTEND THEIR NIGHT LIKE OURS. HI THIS IS A FIVE YEAR PILOT PROGRAM. IN TEN CITIES WHO HAVE REQUESTED TO BE A PART OF THE PILOT PROGRAM. SERVICES TO REPEAT THAT IT IS A PILOT PROGRAM SO WE CAN SEE HOW IT WORKS. THAT THEIR PROBLEMS WE DON'T HAVE TO CONTINUE IT IT WORKS WELL WE CAN CONTINUE IT. OMITTED TO TEN CITIES. WHO HAVE REQUESTED TO BE? IN THE BILL. THE BILL IS ALMOST EXACTLY THE SAME BILL -- THAT THIS LEGISLATURE OVERWHELMINGLY PASSED LAST YEAR AND BIPARTISAN MANNER -- TO CREATE THIS PILOT PROGRAM THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT THIS YEAR AND ADDITION TO THE NINE CITIES FROM LAST YEAR -- THE CITY OF FRESNO -- AGAIN SHOWING BI PARTISANSHIP INCLUDED IN THE BILL -- AND WE HAVE INCLUDED A FRESNO ON SO BECAUSE THIS IS REALLY -- ABOUT GIVING COMMUNITIES FLEXIBILITY. FOR ABOUT A HUNDRED YEARS CALIFORNIA HAS HAD A STATEWIDE -- BLANKET -- AND TONIGHT LIKE OURS -- TO ALCOHOL SERVICE AT OUR BARS OR NIGHTCLUBS -- AT TWO AM WHETHER YOU ARE IN A SMALL RURAL TOWN. OR WHETHER YOU ARE IN DOWNTOWN SAN FRANCISCO OR DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES -- IT HOSTAGES AND AT TWO AM NO FLEXIBILITY NO MATTER WHAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES. AND THIS BILL WILL PROVIDE THESE TEN CITIES WITH THE ABILITY TO DECIDE FOR THEMSELVES. WHETHER TO STAY WITH THE TWO I AM OR GO EARLIER BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT FLEXIBILITY. FOR TO DECIDE WHETHER TO GO LATER. NO CITY WILL BE REQUIRED I AM. THIS BILL IN AND OF ITSELF DOES NOT AUTOMATICALLY CHANGE ANYTHING. ALL IT DOES IS GIVE CITIES PERMISSION TO MAKE THAT DECISION LOCALLY RECOGNIZING THAT NIGHT LIFE IS DIFFERENT. IN DIFFERENT CITIES IF THE CITY DOES NOT ACT. DâN THE RULES DON'T CHANGE THEN THE SAME TWO AM CLOSING TIME. APPLIES IN THOSE CITIES. THE BILL APPLIES TO BARS RESTAURANTS NIGHTCLUBS IT DOES NOT APPLY TO LIQUOR STORES -- SO ARE. I WANT TO ALSO JUST MENTION THAT. OUR CURRENT RIGID TWO AM CLOSING TIME. IS NOT IN LINE WITH OTHER STATES. MORE THAN A DOZEN OTHER STATES ALLOW ALCOHOL SERVICE PAST TWO AM. WHAT CALIFORNIA WE'RE POSE IN THIS BILL IS NOT SOME SORT OF RADICAL DEPARTURE RED STATES BLUE STATES? ALL SORTS OF STATES ALLOW LATER CLOSING TIME AND THE WORLD HASN'T ENDED IN THOSE STATES IT WORKS JUST FINE. MY LIFE IS A MAJOR ECONOMIC DRIVER IN CALIFORNIA IT IS A HUGE EMPLOYER -- IT IS A HUGE -- SOURCE OF TAX REVENUE -- IT'S A HUGE SOURCE OF ECONOMIC NOW PARTICULARLY IN OUR MAJOR CITIES ARE TOURIST CENTERS CALIFORNIA HAS PLACED ITSELF AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE -- BY HAVING -- WHITE IN THE BIG SCHEME OF THINGS IS AN EARLY CLOSING TIME -- DESTROYED CLOSING TIME ALSO DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THAT NOT EVERYONE WORKS AND NINE TO FIVE JOB AND GOES TO BED AT TEN OR ELEVEN AT NIGHT. THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO DON'T EVEN GET OFF WORK. UNTIL MIDNIGHT AND WE BASICALLY TOLD THOSE PEOPLE YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO GO OUT. BECAUSE BY THE TIME THEY GET HOME CHANGE GO OUT AGAIN IT'S ALREADY ONE THIRTY AND THINGS ARE WINDING DOWN. SO THIS BILL ALIGNS US WITH BEST PRACTICES IN OTHER STATES. THE BILL HAS SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC SAFETY SAFEGUARDS AND IT WE WORKED EXTENSIVELY WITH STATEWIDE LAW ENFORCEMENT THIS IS OUR THIRD -- TIME AT THE RODEO ON THIS THE GOVERNOR VETOED THE BILL LAST YEAR. WE NOW HAVE A NEW GOVERNOR SERVER TRYING AGAIN -- WE WORKED EXTENSIVELY WITH STATEWIDE LAW ENFORCEMENT -- TO PUT GUARD RAILS ON THE BILL. THIS IS IN A SITUATION WORK CITY CAN TO SAY IF A CITY THE SIZE THAT IT MIGHT WANT TO DO IT. THE CITY FIRST HAS TO CONVENE A COMMUNITY TASK FORCE TO GO OVER THE ISSUE AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS. THAT TASK FORCE MUST INCLUDE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AND C. H. P. TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS. FIVE THE CITY COUNCIL ALSO HAS TO FORMULATE A PUBLIC SAFETY PLAN. AND THE TRANSPORTATION PLAN TO ENSURE SAFETY. BY THE CITY COUNCIL THEN HAS TO PASS AN ORDINANCE BASED ON THOSE PLANS. AND THAT PLAN THAT GETS SUBMITTED TO THE ABC FOR REVIEW TO MAKE SURE THAT A COMPLY. AND ONCE A. B. C. CERTIFIES THAT THEY'VE DONE WHAT THEY NEED TO DO. THAT'S JUST THE FIRST STEP BECAUSE THE NEXT STEP IS THAT ANY ESTABLISHMENT THAT WANTS TO EXTEND ITS HOURS. HAS TO THEN APPLY TO BBC FOR THAT EXTENSION. THE SAME WAY THAT YOU WOULD APPLY FOR A LIQUOR LICENSE YOU HAVE TO APPLY THEY DO AN INVESTIGATION NEIGHBORS HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT EXPRESS OBJECTIONS ARE SUPPORT. THERE IS AN APPEAL PROCESS. SO THIS IS A VERY VERY ORIENTED APPROACH. IN ADDITION CITIES ARE NOT REQUIRED SIGN ON SWITCH OFF SWITCH -- I I DOUBT THAT ANY CITY WOULD APPLY THIS TO THE WHOLE CITY THEY KIND OF THEY WANT BUT IT'S UNLIKELY. A CITY CAN LIMITED TO ONE ST. OR ONE NEIGHBORHOOD OR ENTERTAINMENT ZONE I CITY CAN SAY WE'RE GOING TO DO IT SEVEN NIGHTS A WEEK WERE ONLY DOING A FRIDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHTS OR A CITY CAN SAY WE'RE ONLY DOING THIS ONE OR TWO NIGHTS A YEAR. FOR SPECIAL EVENTS -- SO CITIES WILL HAVE ENORMOUS FLEXIBILITY IN DECIDING. WHETHER IT MAKES SENSE AND IF SO. IN WHAT FORM. HI I DO WANT TO ADDRESS BECAUSE I KNOW -- EVERY TIME WE RAISES BUILDERS DISCUSSION ABOUT -- DRUNK DRIVING ABOUT THE WISE AND AS I HAVE MENTIONED THIS TO THIS COMMITTEE -- BOTH IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN WHEN I WAS HERE ON THIS IS A VERY PERSONAL ISSUE FOR ME BECAUSE WHEN I WAS A CHILD IN NINETEEN SEVENTIES MY AUNT. MY FATHER'S ONLY SISTER WAS KILLED BY A DRUNK DRIVER. AND THIS IS DURING THE TIME PERIOD ONE LAWS AROUND DRUNK DRIVING WERE INADEQUATE -- THERE WERE NO THEY'RE ALMOST NO CONSEQUENCES ARE FOR THIS PERSON. AND SO THIS IS A PERSONAL ISSUE FOR ME I'M VERY SENSITIVE TO I WOULD NOT POSE A BILL IF I THOUGHT IT WOULD INCREASED DRUNK DRIVING. AND THE REALITY IS THAT DESPITE SOME OF THE COMMON TO HEAR FROM OPPONENTS WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE DATA THERE IS NO DATA INDICATING. THAT LATER CLOSING TIME INCREASES WE HAVE -- COMPARED ALL FIFTY STATES CLOSING TIMES VERSES RATES OF THE Y. COLLISIONS THERE IS NO CORRELATION -- SO THERE UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WHETHER YOU CLOSE THE BARS AT TEN PM MIDNIGHT TO I AM OR FOUR AM THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO LEAVE TRONG AND THEIR CAR AND AS HORRIBLE. THEY NEED TO BE CONSEQUENCES FOR THAT -- BUT IT DOES NOT DEPEND ON WHEN. THE BARS CLOSE. SO COLLEAGUES OUT THIS IS A I I THINK THAT THIS IS A A BILL WHOSE TIME HAS COME. TO GIVE OUR COMMUNITIES WHAT WERE NIGHT LIFE IS SO IMPORTANT CULTURALLY AND ECONOMICALLY. TO GIVE PEOPLE AN CITIES THE OPPORTUNITY. TO TAILOR THEIR NIGHT LIFE O THE NEEDS OF THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO DO AND A FIVE YEAR PILOT PROGRAM. THAT WILL EXPIRE AFTER FIVE YEARS IF WE DON'T EXTEND THAT WE CAN SEE HOW IT WORKS. AND THEN TAKE IT OUT FROM THERE -- AND THEN FINALLY I WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF TRANSPORTATION -- EVER WHEN I FIRST STARTED GOING OUT WHEN I WAS MUCH YOUNGER -- IT WAS YOU KNOW PEOPLE THROW THERE ARE MANY MORE OPTIONS TODAY IN ADDITION TO PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION IN SOME AREAS AND FOUR AM BY THE WAY IS A LOT CLOSER. TO THE OPENING OF PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS LIKE A BAR OR AND LA METRO WHICH OPENED EARLY IN THE MORNING. FOUR AM IS VERY CLOSE TO WHEN THEY OPEN TWO AM IS NOT. BUT APART FROM THAT WE NOW HAVE RIDE SCHERING AND IS A LOT EASIER TO GET AROUND WITHOUT HAVING TO DRIVE -- SO GOD COLLEAGUES -- I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT -- AND WITH ME TODAY ARE BARRED NEW IN WHO'S THE PRESIDENT CEO OF THE CALIFORNIA TRAVEL ASSOCIATION. AND NICOLO DELUCA REPRESENTING THE CITY OF OAKLAND THANK YOU THE MORNING. FOR ME THIS IS PART OF NEWTON. AND PRESIDENCY -- CALIFORNIA TRAVEL ASSOCIATION.

BOTH TO MET DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL VISITORS LOVE TO COME TO OUR STATE. BOTH OF MY MEMBERS REYES WERE AT A DISADVANTAGE AGAINST OTHER DESTINATIONS CITIES BECAUSE OF OUR TWO AM CLOSING. IT HURTS US WHEN WE COMPETE FOR CONVENTIONS FOR CONFERENCES FOR OTHER POPULAR EVENTS. PLEASE USE PILOT PROGRAM AS WAY FOR OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO GROW THE BUSINESS IS THERE ALREADY. I CANNOT DRIVERS FOR THEIR COMMUNITIES IT'S ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY FOR OTHER BUSINESSES TO POTENTIALLY EXPAND THEIR SERVICES. FOR EXAMPLE IF PART A BAR RESTAURANT DOES HAVE EXTENDED HOURS THAT COULD BE TO OTHER BUSINESSES RELATED TO IT LIKE SPECIALIZED LOCAL TOURS TRANSPORTATION COMPANIES. RESORTS ACTIVITIES -- SO OURS AS WELL. THE UNIQUENESS AND APPEAL OF OUR COMMUNITIES -- WILL ONLY LIKELY INCREASE. WITH THIS IT WILL INCREASE THE NUMBER OF CONVENTIONS -- CONFERENCES AND VISITORS AND THEREFORE OUR LOCAL REVENUES. WE BELIEVE SB FIFTY TO BALANCE BILL THAT WILL GIVE LOCAL COMMUNITIES THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE LOCAL ECONOMIES. SO AS TOURISM'S UNITED VOICE IN THE STATE I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU.

MEASURE THANKS. GOOD MORNING BY SHOPPER REPRESENTING CAL ASIAN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU ALL -- EIGHTY SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION. TWO SPEAKERS TWO MINUTES ALL OTHERS WOULD BE ME TO SET THE MOOD AT THE MIKE TO THE LEFT MY LEFT. OKAY I WAS JUST TOLD THAT EACH GET WHAT MADE IT SO THAT'S FINE. I'M FIDGETING TODAY SOME DO THE BEST I CAN. THANK YOU SO MUCH CENTER GORGEOUS. I THANK THE CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR ALLOWING ME TO ADDRESS YOU TODAY MY NAME IS CARSON BUT WHAT'S FREDRICKSON THE RESEARCH MANAGER FOR ALCOHOL JUSTICE IN SAN RAFAEL CALIFORNIA. I'M COURSE MY JOB I HAVE REVIEWED THE PREPONDERANCE OF THE I WANT TO STRESS THIS THE PEER REVIEWED PUBLISHED SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE. AROUND LAST CALL TIMES -- AS SUCH THERE'S THIRTY YEARS OF OF OF RESEARCH FROM ACROSS DEVELOP WORLD NORTH AMERICA THE U. S. EUROPE'S DESTROY IT CETERA SHOWING THE LAST CALL TIMES. ARE EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING DANGEROUS DRIVING. AND STRESS AND EMERGENCY SERVICES THIS VIEW IS SHARED BY THE CDC THE WHL THE US SURGEON GENERAL THE NAIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES AMONG OTHERS -- ENDS FOR THE PURPOSE OF THE STATEMENT I JUST LIKE TO STRESS -- THE DATA SHOWING THAT -- LAST CALL TIMES TEN TO MAKE -- DANGEROUS DRIVING AND ALCOHOL RELATED COLLISIONS AND AND INJURIES GO UP -- DRIVING QUESTIONS INJURIES GO UP GO UP. AND THAT -- THE TENS THAT WHEN YOU SEE LATE LAST CALL TIMES YOU SEE EIGHT CLUSTERING OF THESE TOWARDS THE AREAS WITH THE LAST CALL TIMES. AT POINT IS WORTH TAKING EXTRA ROOM CONSIDER HOW CALL A CAR CRASHES DO NOT OBEY LOCAL CONTROL. WE KNOW FROM -- VENTURA COUNTY'S OWN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DATA THE DRIVERS THAT WILL DIRECTLY ARE APPREHENDED FOR DANGEROUS DRIVING AS MUCH AS FORTY MILES FROM WHERE THEY LAST DRANK. SO SOON AS YOU FIND PEOPLE TRAVELING FROM CITY TO CITY -- AS OPPOSED TO A WITHIN THE CITY YOU FIND RIDE SHARING USE GOES TO NAIL IT PEOPLE DON'T WRITE USE RIGHT DURING THAT WAY. SO PEOPLE WILL TRAVEL TO FINALLY TO BARK PART TIME AND WE KNOW AGAIN FROM U. S. BASED RESEARCH THAT THIS THE TO DO THIS AND IN FACT WE KNOW THIS IS ESSENTIALLY A FEATURE AND NOT A NOT A FULL ON THE BILL. ARE THE NEW CITY CAN POSSIBLE CONTROL WHEN THEIR NEIGHBORS DECIDE TO DISREGARD BY PUBLIC HEALTH BEST PRACTICES AND SAFETY IN IN SETTING THEIR LAST CALL POLICIES LATE. I'M WORDS WHAT'S WORSE IS WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT BORE -- BARRIERS IN LOCALITIES BEING ABLE TO RAISE REVENUE TOP. AND WHEN IT COMES -- TO TO TO TO TO TO CLAIM THE LOCAL CONTROL IS SOMETHING SORT OF GREAT GOOD EXCEPT WHEN IT COMES TO COMPENSATE FOR THE HARMS ALCOHOL CAUSES AT AN INCOHERENT POSITION. SO WE BELIEVE THIS BILL IS SHORT SIGHTED WOULD BRING MANIFEST HARM TO ANY CITY OPTING TO ADOPT LAST CALLS AND ITS NEIGHBORS. AND WOULD HARM THESE THESE -- WOULD LEAVE THE STATE CITIES NOT ADOPTING LAST CALLS WITH HARM WITH NO WAY TO COMPENSATE FOR THE HARM AND AS SUCH I ASK YOU TO VOTE NO ONE SB FIFTY EIGHT THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH NEXT SPEAKER. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS SAID GENESIS HAD AS I AM A MOTHER DAUGHTER A GRANDDAUGHTER IN A COMMUNITY ADVOCATE FOR CREATE TELL LOS ANGELES. TODAY COME REPRESENTING THE COALITION TO PREVENT ALCOHOL RELATED HARMS AND ELLIE METRO A COALITION TO PREVENT SERVICE PROVIDERS AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS A REPRESENTS THE NEIGHBORHOODS OF BOYLE HEIGHTS KOREATOWN SKID ROW IN HOLLYWOOD. NEIGHBORHOODS LIKE THESE ARE OVERWHELMED BY THE OVER SATURATION OF ALCOHOL RETAIL LOCATIONS ARE DESPERATELY LOOKING FOR SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS ITS NEGATIVE IMPACTS. ON PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY AS A COALITION WE SEEK TO BOLSTER RESILIENCE AND COMMUNITIES INCREASING LOCAL OVER SAY WITH REGARDS TO ALCOHOL IS AN EFFECTIVE STRATEGY TO BUILD. HEALTHY PRODUCTIVE IN COLLABORATIVE COMMUNITIES I WAS BORN AND RAISED IN KOREATOWN PLACE KNOWN FOR ITS NIGHTLIFE. GROWING UP IN KOREATOWN MY CURFEW WAS AS SOON AS SCHOOL WAS OUT. AS AN ADULT I KNOW I NOW UNDERSTAND WHY LIVING IN AN AREA WHERE THERE IS AN OVERWHELMING AMOUNT OF OVER SATURATION CONCENTRATION OF THE ALCOHOL OUTLETS DID NOT MAKE IT IDEAL TO FOSTER. HEALTHY GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT IN MYSELF FOR ANY OTHER CHILD TODAY I STAND IN OPPOSITION OF SB FIFTY EIGHT SINCE STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT THERE'S A CORRELATION BETWEEN INCREASE ALCOHOL AVAILABILITY AND ACCESSIBILITY. AND AN INCREASE ALCOHOL RELATED HARMS CRIME IN LONG TERM DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS IN INDIVIDUALS AND COMMUNITIES AS A WHOLE. THE CLAIM THAT NIGHT LIFE IS CRITICAL TO BE A LITTLE THE GREAT POTENTIAL AND ABILITIES THAT EXIST IN OUR COMMUNITIES APART FROM FROM SUBSTANCE CONF CONSUMPTION. MY CONCERN WITH THIS BILL IS THAT LOW INCOME AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES WILL BE IMPACTED THE MOST FAMILIES WHO ARE IN CONSTANT SURVIVAL MODE AND HAVE LIMITED LITERACY OR LUXURY OF TIME. BECOME TARGETS FOR THE EXPANSION OF NIGHT LIFE NIGHTLIFE IS NOT MEANT OR GEARED AT QUOTE ON QUOTE RESPONSIBLE DECISIONS AND IT PERPETUATES JUDGMENT IMPAIRMENT HUMAN TRAFFICKING IN SEX EXPLOITATION AMONG MANY OTHER ISSUES. AS A MOTHER I KNOW THAT THIS IS NOT THE TYPE OF COMMUNITY I WISH MY CHILDREN TO BE RAISED IN AS AN ADVOCATE I KNOW THAT THIS IS NOT THE COMMUNITIES ARE FAMILIES HOPE TO RAISE THEIR CHILDREN IN EITHER. TODAY I STAND AGAINST IN OPPOSITION OF KOREAN BAR BILL NOT JUST FOR MYSELF BUT FOR THOSE STUDENTS DO HOON WHO DO NOT HAVE A VOICE DUE TO THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS AGE. LANGUAGE BARRIER OR ANY OTHER HINDRANCE I'M HERE FOR MY COMMUNITY MY COALITION KOLPAN HAS ALSO TAKEN A STRONG POSITION. ON SB FIFTY EIGHT THIS DOES NOT HELP OUR COMMUNITIES AND TODAY I'M HERE FOR THE VOICES THAT CAP BE HERE FOR THE PEOPLE THAT DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT THESE MEETINGS EXIST. SO I REALLY ASK THE COMMITTEE TO REALLY THINK ABOUT THE PEOPLE THAT TRULY GET AFFECTED BY BILLS LIKE THESE THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY NEXT. GOOD MORNING MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY MY NAME IS SERRA BLANCHE I AM A CONSTITUENT FROM VENICE BEACH CALIFORNIA. I AM ALSO A CO CHAIR OF THE LOS ANGELES DRUG AND ALCOHOL POLICY ALLIANCE. WE HAVE GRAVE CONCERNS ABOUT SB. FIFTY EIGHT THE AUTHOR OF THIS BILL SAYS THAT IT'S ABOUT LOCAL CONTROL. BUT THE DECISION. THAT THE PILOT CITIES LOS ANGELES WEST HOLLYWOOD LONG BEACH AMONG THEM. MAKES ABOUT THIS DIRECTLY TAKES CONTROL AWAY FROM DOZENS. OF CITIES THAT ARE ADJACENT TO THEM. PASADENA HERMOSA BEACH CARSON HAS SO MANY OTHER CITIES AROUND CALIFORNIA. WELL HAVE TO PICK UP THE PIECES -- FROM DRIVERS WHO BEEN DRINKING TILL FOUR AM PASSING THROUGH. THE BE FORCED TO PAY FOR THE ADDITIONAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AND EMERGENCY SERVICES COSTS THAT WILL INEVITABLY BE REQUIRED. WHEN IT COMES TO LOCAL CONTROL FOR MOST CALIFORNIA CITIES SB FIFTY EIGHT TAKES IT AWAY? I'M I WE LIVE AND WORK ON THE WEST SIDE. AS PART OF MY WORK ON CALL TO SPEAK WITH COMMUNITY MEMBERS ON A REGULAR BASIS. IT IS A VERY DENSELY CONCENTRATED AREA WHEN IT COMES TO ALCOHOL BUSINESSES THERE ARE BARS AND RESTAURANTS AND CLUBS THAT ARE ABOUT IT UP AGAINST RESIDENTIAL AREAS IN SOME INSTANCES TWELVE FEET ACROSS. FROM ACROSS AN ALLEY FROM PEOPLE'S BEDROOMS. THEY DON'T WANT. LEADER SERVING WHAT'S MORE DRUNKENNESS THEY DON'T WANT MORE NOISE THEY DON'T WANT MORE FIGHTING THEY DON'T WANT MORE PUBLIC NUISANCE PERIOD THEY DON'T WANT THIS BILL. IN CLOSING I WOULD SAY THAT THIS BILL IS DESCRIBED AS A PILOT PROGRAM. I WOULD ARGUE STRONGLY THIS CONCEPT DOES NOT NEED TO BE PILOTED. THIS HAS BEEN TRIED ON IN CITIES INTERNATIONALLY AND IN THE UNITED STATES. AND AS MY COLLEAGUE MENTIONED. THE PEER REVIEWED SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE. INDICATES IRREFUTABLY THAT THERE ARE INCREASES THAT DRAMATIC IMPACT THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY SO AS BAD. OUR MY OFTEN BEFORE YOUR COMMITTEE YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU A QUESTION OF ECONOMICS QUESTION OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY ECONOMIC CAN BE A VERY STRONG MOTIVATOR. BUT AS IS EVIDENCED BY THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE FROM THE CITIES HERE IN SUPPORT. WE ASKED TODAY THAT YOU CHOOSE ON THE SIDE OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY. PLEASE VOTE NO ON THIS VERY DANGEROUS BILL.

YOU KNOW. IF YOU ASK THEM. I WOULD SAY 75% OF THEIR OFFICERS WORK OVERNIGHT. AND ONLY. TWENTY FIVE DURING THE WHOLE DAY -- ALCOHOL RELATED CRIME A NUISANCE ACTIVITY IS ON A RISE IN HOLLYWOOD AND IS FURTHER EXACERBATED BY THE HOMELESS ISSUE. AND RECENT LEGALIZATION OF MARIJUANA. TO EXTEND SERVING HOURS BEYOND JM ONLY STRETCH PLEASE DEPARTMENTS LIMITED RESOURCES AND CAUSE UNDUE STRESS ON POLICE FORCE BARELY KEEPING UP PACE WITH. CRIME IN THE AREA. COMMUTING TRAFFIC CAN ONLY BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THIS MEASURE. SPREAD OUT THE AT WHICH AT THE TIME AT WHICH DO YOU EYES. ARE MOST PREVALENT. FOR THE STRETCHING Là FOR SOME RESOURCES. HI THE HIGH RIDGE PATROLS ALREADY. EXPRESSED DOUBTS ABOUT THIS ENDEAVOR. AND I WOULD CONSIDER THEM THE FOREMOST AUTHORITY ON THIS KIND OF STUFF -- CONCERNS AS FAR AS TRAFFIC AND PEDESTRIANS AND HOW IT AFFECTS THE NEGATIVELY. HOLLYWOOD HAS MORE TO OFFER. AND JUST TALK ALL.

FRED JONES ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL ON ALCOHOL PROBLEMS IN OPPOSITION WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO LOOK AT THE GRAPH [inaudible] THANK YOU. JAMIE RICH ON BEHALF OF ADAPT Là MERENDA WHERE NONE OF THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND CONTRA COSTA THANK THIS IS A GOOD IDEA. THANK YOU -- SAY NO OTHERS SPEAKERS IS PUT BACK TO COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS CONCERNS. CENTER BARGES FIRST THEY WILL GO TO CENTER ARCHER LET AFTER THAT. THANK YOU I WANTED TO RUN. RE STATE A COUPLE OF KEY COMPONENTS OF THIS -- OF THIS PROPOSAL. THAT I THINK TEND TO GET OVERLOOKED -- BECAUSE THIS ISSUE WAS CERTAINLY -- INSPIRES THE PASSIONS ARE ONE THE REASON WHY I AM SUPPORTING -- THIS -- THIS -- PROPOSED PIECE OF LEGISLATION IS BECAUSE THE DECISION. IS -- IT WILL BE PLACED IN THE HANDS OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT -- WHEN THIS ISSUE OF IF IT IF IT GETS APPROVED THROUGH THIS BODY AND DOWN THE LINE? THAT ARE FRESNO FOR EXAMPLE I USE FRESNO BECAUSE THAT'S THE AREA I REPRESENT THAT'S ONE OF THE D. PROPOSED PILOT AREAS. I CONSULTED WITH THE THE MAYOR OF THE CITY OF FRESNO I CONSULTED WITH THE POLICE CHIEF OF THE CITY OF FRESNO. BOTH OF WHOM OFFERED THEIR SUPPORT PRINCIPALLY BECAUSE IT WAS GOING TO GO THROUGH A LOCAL PROCESS. AND IT WAS GOING TO LOOK AT THE LOCAL FACTORS HE WAS GOING TO LOOK AT THE LOCAL PUBLIC SAFETY CONCERNS AND ALL THE EXTERNALITIES OF VARIABLES THAT GO INTO. A LOCAL DECISION MAKING. AND ALSO TAKE IT IS IT. THAT I THOUGHT WAS KEY. SO PUTTING THEM ON THE LIST OF OF A PROPOSED CITIES IN A PILOT PROGRAM. IS ONLY MAKING THEM ELIGIBLE TO MAKE CONSIDERATIONS ON THEIR OWN. AND I THAT I THINK IS A VERY SMART WAY OF MOVING THIS PROJECT FORWARD. IS THATTHE CITY PRISON DECIDES NOT TO DO IT HE DOES NOT HAVE. TO AND THERE'S ALSO WHETHER -- APPROVALS THAT HE TO BE GOTTEN. TOM THREE BC AND SO ON SO FORTH SO FOR THAT REASON -- I'M GOING TO DEFER TO MINE. ARE THE LOCAL LEADERSHIP AND MY DISTRICT -- TO GO THROUGH ITS COMMUNITY PROCESS AND SEE IF THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE DIRECTLY IMPACTED FEEL THE SAME WAY OF THOSE WHO WANT TO HAVE MORE ENTERTAINMENT FOUR OR MORE CONCERNED ABOUT PUBLIC SAFETY -- CONSIDERATIONS SO WITH THAT -- AND I'D BE HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE THERE ARE CHIRLA. YES THANK YOU CENTER FOR MAKING THE PRESENTATION IN AN ARC KNOWLEDGE -- EVERYONE WHO SPOKE TODAY OF I HAVE A LAW ENFORCEMENT BACKGROUND SO MY CONCERN. OF WOULD BE PUBLIC SAFETY NO DOUBT. AND SO MY QUESTION IS -- HAVE YOU IN DEPTH -- WORK WITH TALKED WITH SOME OF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS OF THE CITY'S NAME -- AND ALSO BEING A FORMER MAYOR OF A CITY I KNOW THAT THE ISSUE LIKE THIS COMING FOR CITY COUNCIL OF ALSO BRINGS IN THE VOICE TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC. AND THAT'S WHY I CAN SEE THAT IF THE COMMUNITY HAS THE OPPORTUNITY -- TO HEAR ALL THE FACTS THEN THE COMMUNITIES THEMSELVES CAN GO HEAD GO IN THAT DIRECTION. I'M ALSO IMPRESSED WITH THE FACT THAT THAT WOULD BE TWENTY TWO DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS AND THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT WILL HAVE THE TAX FOR INVOLVED WITH ABC. AND THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT I A LOOK FOR IT OF COURSE THE HIGHWAY PATROL. IS MENTIONED IN THE LAW ENFORCEMENT TAX OPERATE IN SOME OF THE SUCCESS YOU HAD WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. YEAH THANK YOU -- CENTER FOR THE QUESTION AND WE HAVE A WORKED EXTENSIVELY PARTICULARLY WITH THE POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION AND WITH C. H. P. -- AND BOTH OF THEM OFFERED AMENDMENTS -- THAT WE ACCEPTED AND THAT'S WHY -- AS YOU NOTED THERE ARE IS A VERY STRUCTURED PROCESS WITH MANDATORY PARTICIPATION BY LOCAL POLICE AND BY CHP -- SO WE'VE -- WE DEFINITELY THERE WAS A PRIORITY FOR ME TO WORK CLOSELY. WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT -- AND I I THINK IT MADE THE BILL -- BETTER -- IN TERMS OF PUTTING THOSE PUBLIC SAFETY CARD COUNSEL FORMULATE A PUBLIC SAFETY PLAN AND THE TRANSPORTATION PLAN -- AND ABC HAS TO VERIFY THAT THEY ACTUALLY DID THAT ON AND THEN -- AS I NOTED BEFORE FOR EACH AND EVERY -- AND THIS IS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE'VE HAVING SOME OF THE OPPOSITION YOU WOULD THINK THAT THE SERVICES BILL GET SIGNED. ALL THE SUDDEN YOU'RE GOING TO SEE ALL THESE VENUES OPENING AND IT IT IN ADDITION TO THE LOCAL PROCESS TO HOUSE TAKE PLACE -- AS I MENTIONED EARLIER ON EVERY SINGLE MONTH TO PASS THE ORDINANCE NOTHING HAPPENS UNTIL OF BAR NIGHTCLUB MAKES AN APPLICATION TO ABC -- AS IS THE NORMAL PRACTICE AND AS A FORMER LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS WELL YOU AND I BOTH KNOW THIS. THEN THEY CUT -- ABC ALWAYS SIX IMPORT FROM THE LOCAL POLICE CAPTAIN A POLICE CHIEF WHO MAKES A RECOMMENDATION AND DOESN'T INVESTIGATION. AND SO LAW ENFORCEMENT IS INVOLVED AT EVERY SINGLE STEP OF THIS PROCESS. BY WHICH MAKES ME CONFIDENT THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE DONE IN A RESPONSIBLE WAY [inaudible] THANK YOU. BRADFORD. THANK YOU I'M SURE I'M SERIOUS. ABSENT ALCOHOL COULD A ESTABLISHMENT MAKE AN APPLICATION TO STAY OPEN PASSED TO HIM AND NOT SERVE ALCOHOL THE THEY CAN -- THERE AND THERE ARE -- IN SAN FRANCISCO AND I ASSUME IN LA NOW THERE ARE -- PER. THE REALITY IS THAT ECONOMICS TO COME INTO PLAY -- AND THESE ARE OVERWHELMINGLY SMALL BUSINESSES -- THAT -- YOU KNOW THEY THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THEIR PAYROLL AND COVER THEIR EXPENSES -- AND SO THAT YOU KNOW. ALCOHOL DOES -- PLAY INTO THAT -- BUT YES THEY KIND IT'S NOT VERY COMMON -- BUT THIS WILL -- INCREASE THE NUMBER OF VENUES THAT ARE ABLE. TO DO THAT THE FOOD SERVICE COULD BE PART OF THAT AS WELL. TWO IF YOU CAN TO OUR YES -- AND RIGHT YES YOU CAN CONTINUE TO SERVE -- TO AND AND THAT'S NOT AFFECTED AT ALL. BECAUSE I'VE HEARD BOTH POINT CONDOM COME FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT I LIKE THAT ASPECT OF LETTING AND CITIES DECIDE IF IN FACT THIS IS NOT A BLANKET. YOU KNOW A PERMIT TO DO IT AUTOMATICALLY SHOULD FOR CONSIDERATION BUT I'VE HEARD FROM A LOT OF FOLKS YOU. STAY OUT LATE I USED TO BE IN A CLUB PROMOTION BUSINESS A LOT OF FOLKS WOULD LIKE THE STOPS MEANT TO STAY OPEN A LITTLE LATER FOR THOSE WHO HE HAD A DRINK UP TO TWO O'CLOCK. AND ALLOW THEM TO SOBER UP A LITTLE BIT FIRST IS HITTING THE STREET. AT A HARD STOP AT TWO O'CLOCK SO IT'S FOR PROS AND CONS AND THOSE EXTENDED HOURS AS WELL SO ANYTHING ELSE. I JUST HAVE TO TELL YOU I SO ADMIRE YOU AS A LEGISLATOR. EVERY TIME YOU. I'VE BEEN A NO ON THE BILL ON THE BEAT I KNOW IN THE BILL AGAIN TODAY BUT EVERY TIME YOU BROUGHT THIS BILL BACK IT'S GOTTEN BETTER AND BETTER MAYBE WE SHOULD -- HAVE A VETO IT AGAIN THEY WILL BE EVEN BETTER NEXT YEAR. HELLO A KID ON THAT BUT I'VE I PRE I APPRECIATE ALL THE SAFEGUARDS I APPRECIATE ALL THE DILIGENT WORK AND EVEN VERY THOROUGH FOR ME JUST ONE LIFE IS TOO MANY I CAN'T GET THERE EVEN THOUGH I'M A LOCAL CONTROL GUY. YOU CERTAINLY DONE THAT PILOT I MEAN I COULDN'T ASK YOU TO DO ANYMORE THAN YOU'VE DONE I JUST PHILOSOPHICALLY I I CAN GET THERE BUT REALLY -- PRECIADO YOUR EFFORTS AND WITH THAT YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND CLOSE. I THANK YOU A HI MISTER SHERMAN FOR A FOR THIS REMARKS I COMPLETELY RISK FAMILY HAVE BEEN IMPACTED -- BY -- BY DRUNK DRIVING AND AS SOMEONE WHO HAVE YOU KNOW THE THE WHEN I WAS ON THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS ONE OF THE NEIGHBORHOODS I REPRESENTATIVE WAS A VERY INTENSIVE. NIGHT LIFE AREA WE ALWAYS HAVE TO WORK VERY HARD TO BALANCE ALL THE VARIOUS NEWS I I RESPECT THAT. I JUST A FEW THINGS I WANT TO MENTION -- ONE IS IN TERMS OF AND NOT THE ISSUE OF NEIGHBORING TOWNS NEIGHBORING CITIES AND AN ABSOLUTELY IF ONE CITY DECIDE TO DO SOMETHING. YOU KNOW THAT THEIR NEIGHBORING CITIES AS WELL WE ACTUALLY PUT A PROVISION IN WHICH I NEGLECTED THAT WHEN A CITIES CONSIDERING DOING THIS THEY HAVE TO SEND NOTIFICATION TO ALL OF THEIR NEIGHBORING CITIES INVITING FEEDBACK FROM THOSE CITIES. AND WALL YES THIS CREATES DIFFERENT CLOSING TIMES IN DIFFERENT CITIES AND THERE WAS A COMMENT MADE ON THAT -- WE HAVE THAT NOW BECAUSE NOT EVERYSTOP NOT EVERY CITY GOES TO TO I AM NOT SOME CITIES REQUIRE EARLIER CLOSER. FOR YOU AND SO YOU ALREADY TODAY HAVE AREAS ARE CLOSE AT MIDNIGHT OR ONE OR TWO SO IF IF STAGGER CLOSING TIMES AN ISSUE. THAT'S AN ISSUE THAT EXISTS RIGHT NOW TERMS OF SOME COMMENTS OR SATURATION IN SOME NEIGHBORHOODS WHICH I AGREE THERE ARE NEIGHBORHOODS IN SAN FRANCISCO AND LA AND ELSEWHERE WITH OVERSATURATION OF ALCOHOL ESTABLISHMENTS. ON MY IN MY EXPERIENCE DOT OVER SATURATION IS IS FREQUENTLY ABOUT LIQUOR STORES WE HAVE NEIGHBORHOODS IN MY DISTRICT WHERE THEY'RE WAY TOO MANY LIQUOR STORES -- AND NOT CAUSES SO MANY OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE SEE AROUND -- ALCOHOL AND AND CHRONIC ALCOHOLISM -- AND SO CITIES. TODAY AND THEY WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE THEIR OWN ABILITY TO SAY WE DON'T WANT MORE ESTABLISHMENTS OR WE WANT FEWER ESTABLISHMENT SO WE'RE GOING. TO NOT SUPPORT NEW LIQUOR LICENSES THEY CAN DO THAT NOW THAT IS A LOCAL ISSUE AND THIS WAS SIMPLY NOT CHANGE THAT -- SO COLLEAGUES NIGHT LIFE IS IMPORTANT -- AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE.

SB FIFTY THREE FIXES A LOOPHOLE. IN THE BAGLEY KEENE OPEN MEETINGS ACT TO ENSURE COMPLETE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR STATE GOVERNMENT. EXISTING LAW ALLOWS STATE AGENCIES BOARDS ANOTHER GOVERNMENTAL BODIES TO FORMAT VICE RESET COMMITTEES THAT DO NOT HAVE TO COMPLY WITH OPENING OPEN MEETING REQUIREMENTS. AS LONG AS THEY ONLY HAVE TWO MEMBERS. THESE COMMITTEES ARE CAPABLE OF WIELDING SIGNIFICANT POWER AND INFLUENCE BUT ARE ABLE TO CLOSER MEETINGS OFF TO THE PUBLIC BECAUSE OF A TECHNICALITY IN CURRENT LAW. A NUMBER STATE AGENCIES AND BOARDS HAVE EXPLOITED CURRENT LAW TO KEEP THEIR OPERATIONS HIDDEN FROM THE PUBLIC EYE. THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO REASON THAT THESE COMMITTEES TO BE MEETINGS SUPPORT BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO MEMBERS RATHER THAN. THREE SB FIFTY THREE WILL CLOSE THAT LOOPHOLE IN GUARANTEE THAT ALL STATE GOVERNMENT BODIES OPERATE WITH COMPLETE TRANSPARENCY -- THE SAME MEASURE I INTRODUCED IN THE PAST IT RECEIVED EIGHTY AYE VOTES IN THE ASSEMBLY. FORTY AYE VOTES IN THE SENATE AND WAS VETOED -- BY THE PRIOR ADMINISTRATION. SAW BRING IT BACK THIS YEAR -- I DON'T KNOW IF YOU ALL HAD THAT I'VE READ A GOVERNOR NUISANCE BOOK CITIZENS BILL WHICH TALKS ABOUT TRANSPARENCY IN GOVERNMENT AND ALL THE GREAT THINGS HE DID WHEN HE WAS MAYOR SAN FRANCISCO.

TO ONE HUNDRED BARRELS. AS YOU WRITE ME MEMBERS YOU MIGHT REMEMBER LAST YEAR THAT FABULOUS BILL -- US BE TWELVE EIGHTY THREE FOR MADE SEVERAL CHANGES -- TO THE BREW PUB RESTAURANT LICENSE GRANNY ADDITIONAL PRIVILEGES -- TO THE LICENSEE AS WELL AS PROVIDING ADDITIONAL ENFORCEMENT TOOLS THE DEPARTMENT OF ABC ALL THOSE ARE FULLY INTACT. THIS PARTICULAR PROVISION OF THE BILL THAT WE SEEK TO REVERT BACK TO WAS BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTION WAY AFTER THE FACT. UNFORTUNATELY THERE WAS NO ADVOCATES THE CAME ON BEHALF OF THE MANY OF THESE TYPES SEVENTY FIVE LICENSES. IN CONTINUING -- AND NOT CHANGES THIS BILL COULD RESULT IN MANY RESTAURANTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I EITHER BECOMING TOTALLY A PROFITABLE AND US THE OLD REALLY GOING OUT OF BUSINESS SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. HE SPEAKERS IN SUPPORT. ANY SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION. IF YOU COME UP HERE FEEL LIKE WHATEVER YOUR PREFERENCES. HEY FRED JONES I'M I WAS TAPPED BY OUT CALLED JUSTICE TO GIVE THEIR PROXY BUT I ALSO REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL ON ALCOHOL PROBLEMS. THE CONCERN WE HAVE IS THERE'S BEEN A HUGE SPIKE IN THE NUMBER OF TYPE. SEVENTY FIVE LICENSES IN THE STATE WE THINK IT'S TO GO AROUND THE MORE DIFFICULT TYPE FORTY SEVEN LICENSES AND FRANKLY WE THINK SOME OF THESE PER PROBE SUGGESTED -- TO GET -- THEIR LICENSE -- WITHOUT HAVING TO GO THROUGH THE MORE RIGOROUS AND MORE DIFFICULT TO FIND A NUMBER OF TYPE FORTY SEVEN SO. THAT'S WHAT WE THINK RESULTED -- IN THERE FOR WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS EXTENDED FOR ANOTHER COUPLE YEARS LET'S SEE WHAT THE REAL IMPACT IS BUT WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT TYPE. SEVENTY FIVE THANK YOU I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY PULL BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. QUESTIONS COMMENTSCONCERNS MISTER BRADFORD THANK YOU MISSED YEAR ON YES I WAS AUTHORED TWELVE EIGHTY THREE LARGER AND I APPRECIATE TO SUPPORT THAT THIS COMMITTEE AND CHAIRMAN ARE PROVIDED AS WE MOVE. FOR AND AS WE OFTEN SAY THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF LEGISLATION THAT HAS GOOD INTENTIONS AND IT WAS BY NO MEANS -- WHEN WE WERE RUNNING THIS BILL TO PUT THE STRESS AND STRAIN ON THOSE BREW PUBS WE'VE BEEN NOTIFIED OF SOME THOSE CHALLENGES SO REDUCE IT FROM TWO HUNDRED BARRELS DOWN TO A HUNDRED I THINK IS COMMON SENSE AND? HOPEFULLY OF THOSE SMALL BUSINESSES CAN THRIVE IN HERE TO NOT JUST MAKE A PROFIT BUT PROVIDE A QUALITY PRODUCT AS WELL SO I SUPPORT THE MEASURE -- BARGES. JUST JUST ECHO THAT I THINK -- AND IT'S STILL WITHIN THE REASONABLE CATEGORY IT ALSO MAKES AVAILABLE -- FOR FOR DIFFERENT TYPES OF PRODUCTS THAT MAY NOT BE IS COST EFFECTIVE EL ESPECIALLY NEXT BERMAN TATIAN STAGE SO I WOULD SUPPORT THIS AS WELL.
