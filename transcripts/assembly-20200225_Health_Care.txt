THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WHEN YOU PASSED LEGISLATION LIKE THIS THAT YOU THEN REALIZE LATER THAT YOU'VE PEOPLE A LOT OF WORK HEY THINGS THEY HAVE TO DO AN AND KEEP UP WITH THE WE- THAT IN THE- SOME ADJUSTMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE WE'VE GONE. AND I'M SURE WILL BE TO HAVE MORE WORK. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. QUESTIONS FROM CENTER. THE. NO OKAY I THINK THINK THINK YOU MUCH. HIM AND COMING CALLAHAN CALLAHAN NO EIGHT. THANK YOU UP CEO OF COMPASSION AND CHOICES A WE KNOW A JUST OF THE LEGISLATION AS WE AS THIS WORK ACROSS THE COUNTRY THE YOU FOR YOUR WORK HERE TO AND US A CHANCE TO SHARE WITH YOU WHAT WE'VE SEEN I'M WITH LIMITATION CALIFORNIA BUT ALSO ACROSS ALL OF THE- TEN AUTHORIZED JURISDICTIONS BUT BEFORE I DO THAT I JUST WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO REALLY THINK IN ACKNOWLEDGE ALL OF YOU ON THE- OUR SUPPORTERS AND MANY OTHER. ON FELLOW AND WE ARE SO. THE LEADERSHIP OF ASSEMBLY AGAWAM EGGMAN OF CENTER MONEY IN OF SENATOR WALK AND YOU HAVE REALLY MADE A LOT OF TRIMMING THE AMERICANS SO MUCH BETTER THANK YOU. COMPARE AND CHOICES HAS BEEN IN. IN A AND- OF THE- AND OF LIKE OPTION ACTED ALSO HAVE WORKED. ALL OF THE OFF. JURISTIC AND WANTED TO SHOW. THE EVIDENCE AND THE DATE FROM ACROSS- ALL OF THOSE PLACE BUT BEFORE I DO THAT- WANTED TO JUST PUT THIS LAW IN CONTEXT AND IT SOUNDS LIKE EACH OF YOU HAVE HAD. EXPERIENCE TO TALK WITH BUDDY. ENTER EL AN I IN MY- THEM FORTUNATE THAT I GET TO HAVE THAT EXPERIENCE ON A REGULAR BASIS- THERE WAS ONE WOMAN THAT I HAD A CONVERSATION WITH FROM HALF MOON BAY. AND SHE- CAN. AND IT WOULD TAKE HER. AND HER. SHARING THAT X. WITH ME. AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN HER ENTIRE DEMEANOR CHANGED. AND SHE TALKED ABOUT THE MOMENT THAT SHE RECEIVED THE PRESCRIPTION AND SHE SAID. THIS WAS MY PRESCRIPTION FOR PEACE OF MIND IT WAS A GIFT TO ME. AND THAT IS WHAT THIS LAWS ABOUT AND WHY IT IS MADE SUCH A PROFOUND DIFFERENCE IN THE LIVES OF SO MANY PEOPLE. THANK YOU. WE KNOW FROM A COMBINED FORTY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE ACROSS TEN AUTHORIZED JURISDICTIONS- THAT THERE HAS BEEN NO NEGATIVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AS A RESULT OF THIS LW. THERE HAS NOT BEEN A SINGLE INCIDENCE- OF PROVEN ABUSE MISUSE OR COERCION ON THAT'S BEEN THE EXPERIENCE IN CALIFORNIA AND IT IS BEEN EXPERIENCE AND EVERY OTHER AUTHORIZED JURISDICTION. WE ALSO KNOW FROM STUDIES THE JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ETHICS- REPORT CONCLUDED THAT ASSISTED DYING DID NOT POSE ANY HEIGHTENED RISKS FOR ANY POPULATION INCLUDING VULNERABLE POPULATIONS- WHAT WE'VE HEARD FROM THE CALIFORNIA DATA WHICH IS CONSISTENT ACROSS ALL OF THE STATE'S IS THAT VERY FEW PEOPLE WILL CHOOSE TO USE THE LAW. BUT HUGE PERCENTAGES HAVE GOTTEN- TREMENDOUS PEACE OF MIND FROM SIMPLY KNOWING THE LOGS THIS- WE HAVE SEEN RESEARCH STUDIES THAT HAVE COME OUT- THAT HAVE A DEMONSTRATED THAT AS A RESULT OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF MEDICAL AID IN DYING THERE IS A JOURNAL OF PALLIATIVE MEDICINE STUDY. THAT IT IS RESULTED IN MORE CANDID CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN DOCTORS AND PATIENTS HIGHER HOSPICE USAGE RATES AND IMPROVED PALLIATIVE CARE TRAINING FOR PHYSICIANS IN HERE IN CALIFORNIA THE PHYSICIANS OF CALIFORNIA HAVE REPORTED SEVERAL THIS OP VERY SIMILAR POSITIVE. BENEFITS AS A RESULT OF THE LAW SO THE GOOD NEWS IS WE HAVE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT TO FEEL GOOD ABOUT- THERE'S NO NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES AND THEY HAVE BàN- IMPROVEMENTS FOR THE INDIVIDUAL DYING PERSON AND ALSO TO ALL OF END OF LIFE CARE IN CALIFORNIA- UNFORTUNATELY OR- THERE IS ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT WHICH OF COURSE IS THE CASE ANY TIME THAT YOU TO PASS A LAW AND WHAT I'D LIKE. YOU TO SHARE A LITTLE OF A AREAS. IN CAN FORGET AND RIPPED ONCE IN THAT THE GREETINGS TO ASSEMBLYMEMBER WHO JOINED US WAS ALSO A COLD ON THIS BILL BEEN CONSIST MEMBER OF THE STILL COMMITTEE ON AND APPLY ISSUES GOING TO MAKE ANY REMARKS JIM. WITH THE ABILITY FOR THE FAMILY TO BE SUPPORT OF IS JUST SO ESSENTIAL. AND MY HAT'S OFF TO EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU IN. THE CHAMBER TODAY THANKING YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT BECAUSE- WE'VE ALL RIGHT UP AGAINST THIS ISSUE AND- AND OUR FAMILIES AND LOVED ONES. JUST HUMAN BEINGS DESERVE THIS KIND OF. UNITY SO THANK YOU THANK YOU. AND THANK YOU. FRAZIER IN TERMS OF THE SORT OF BROUGHT OVER STROKES IS THAT THE LAW IS WORKING TO PROTECT PATIENTS BUT THAT THERE ARE JUST TOO MANY REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS IT'S ABOUT A THIRTEEN STEP PROCESS FOR SOMEBODY TO GET THROUGH. AND PEOPLE ARE UNFORTUNATELY DIE IN TRYING TO GET THROUGH THE PROCESS AND NEVER ACHIEVING THAT PEACE OF MIND THAT-% THEY'RESEEKING- WE'VE SEEN IT REALLY- THERE'S A TON OF DIFFERENT- CHALLENGES WITH THE LAW THERE ARE THREE THAT KEEP EMERGING AS THE TOP THINGS TO CONSIDER A DRESSED IN FUTURE LEGISLATION- THE FIRST IS THE FIFTEEN DAY WAITING PERIOD. THERE'S A STUDY THAT CAME OUT FROM SOUTHERN SIR- THAT SHOWED THAT AT LEAST A THIRD OF PEOPLE WERE DYING DURING THAT FIFTEEN DAY WAITING PERIOD- THAT KAISER SOUTHERN IS AS SUPPORTIVE- INSTITUTION THAT HAS- A PATIENT NAVIGATORS. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE STARTING OUT IN ON SUPPORT OF SYSTEMS OR SOMEBODY THAT'S MORE FRAGMENTED SO YOU. THAT THE NUMBER IS ACTUALLY FAR FAR HIGHER THAN THE 30% THAT THEIR STUDY SHOWED- THERE ARE OTHER STATES THAT ARE ADDRESSING THIS WITH SOME INNOVATIVE LEGISLATION WERE AGAIN JUST PASSED A LAW LAST SESSION. THAT MAKES IT SO THAT THE DOCTORS ARE ALLOWED TO WAIVE THE FIFTEEN DAY WAITING PERIOD IF SOMEBODY IS DEFINITELY GONNA DIE. OR ALSO TO STATE- NEW YORK IN MINNESOTA AT ARE ACTUALLY A LIMóN. RECOGNIZING HER DO IT. TEAM MEETING AS CAN SOMEBODY TO SUFFER FIFTEEN. AND IT REALLY IS DOES NOT PROVE TO HAVE ANY ANY POSITIVE BENEFITS TO IT- THE SECOND BIG CHALLENGE IS THAT PATIENTS ARE HAVING A REALLY DIFFICULT TIME GETTING TO DOT. A AND THERE'S A HOST OF REASONS FOR THIS ONE OF THE TOP ONES THAT- REASONS IS THAT AS YOU KNOW THERE'S AN OPT OUT PROVISION FOR HEALTH SYSTEM SO HELP SYSTEMS ARE ALLOWED TO ALLOW ALL OF THEIR- DOCTORS- TO NOT BE ALLOWED TO PARTICIPATE. AS A RESULT OF THAT- THERE WAS A STUDY THAT WAS PUBLISHED IN JAMMEH THAT SHOWED THAT NINETY SEVEN PERCENT. RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS ALLOW PERSON IS A PATIENT AND 35% OF SECULAR HOSPITALS SO THAT REALLY NARROWS THE NUMBER OF DOCTORS THAT ARE POTENTIALLY ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE AT. WITH US SO THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS AND THEN SOME OF THE PAPERWORK THAT IS INVOLVED- IT REALLY CHECK TEACHING PEOPLE DOCTORS HOW TO DO THAT I AM. ALSO PRESENTS A BARRIER AS WELL WHEN THEY HAVE TO DO THAT SAME THING FOR OTHER END OF LIFE OPTIONS. THERE ARE- THREE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT STATES ARE LOOKING AT TO ADDRESS THIS- NEW MEXICO HAS A REALLY INNOVATIVE PERMIT PARISIAN THAT WAS IN THEIR LAST LEGISLATION THAT ALLOWS A PERSON WHO WAS ALREADY ON HOSPICE CARE TO ALL. HAVE TO GET ONE ADDITIONAL CERTIFICATION SO THEY'VE MET CERTIFICATION HAVING THAT SIX MONTH ELIGIBLE CRITERIA. THE ALL TO FIND ONE OTHER DOCTOR THAT WOULD BE THE PRESCRIBING DOCTOR. FIVE STATES THAT ARE RIGHT. DANCING THAT WOULD EXTEND- THE PRIVILEGES SO THAT- APR ENDS AND PHYSICIANS' ASSISTANTS ARE ALLOWED TO PRESCRIBE. SO THERE'S FIVE STATE DOING THAT THAT'S LEGISLATURE. RIGHTLY ADVANCING THROUGH HAWAII THIS SESSION THEY'VE MADE IT THE PHARMACIST- AND THEN THERE ARE SOME STATES THAT HAVE LESS REPORTING REQUIREMENTS THAN WHAT IS HERE IN CALIFORNIA BOTH VERMONT AND COLORADO DO AND OF COURSE MONTANA HAS NON BECAUSE IT'S THROUGH THE COURTS. THE THIRD- BIG CHALLENGE THAT WE SEE WITH THE LAW IS THAT THERE IS A LACK OF TRANSPARENCY IN THE PRACTICE SOMETIMES PATIENTS ARE NOT GETTING COMPLETE INFORMATION FROM THEIR HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS YOU'LL HEAR SOME STORIES ABOUT THAT LATER TODAY- OTHER DOCTORS TO OBJECT TO THE PRACTICE ARE REFUSE- PATIENCE- REFUSING TO EVEN REFERRED TO ANOTHER PRACTICE AND SUMMER EVEN HOLDING MEDICAL. CARD HOSTAGE- THAT IS JUST CRAZY- IN DELAWARE THEY HAVE A PROVISION I'M IN THEIR BILL THAT WOULD ALLOW HEALTH FACILITIES THAT POP OUT OF THE PRACTICE- TO IMPLEMENT GET NOT TO BE. IMPLEMENTED BORDERS ON THEIR DOCTORS TO SILENCE THEM- AND THEN THERE IS PENDING IN WASHINGTON STATE LEGISLATION THAT WOULD REQUIRE HOSPICES HOSPITALS TO REPORT THEIR POLICIES TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH. SO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CAN PUBLISH THEM AND THAT WOULD THEN ALLOW PATIENTS TO BE ABLE TO SELECT THEIR FACILITIES BASED ON- THOSE THAT ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THEIR VALUES AND PRIORITIES THEY'RE ONLY DOING HOSPITALS BUT WHAT WOULD BE RIDLEY INNOVATIVE IS IF YOU DID HOSPICES. WELL I THE SORT OF BIG. C. AS YOU CAN WHERE WRECK. THE X. OF ELIGIBLE CRITERIA REMOVING ANY OF THE COURSE SAVE CAR TO REALLY JUST LOOKING FR VERY. PRACTICAL WAYS THAT WE CAN ADDRESS SOME OF THE CHALLENGES SO THAT YOU BEAT THE ORIGINAL TENSION OF A LOT BETTER. I'M GONNA END WITH PERHAPSMY MOST IMPORTANT MESSAGE OF THE DAY WHICH IS REALLY ONE OF GRATITUDE- WITHOUT QUESTION THE CALIFORNIA AND OF LIFE OPTION ACT HAS RESULTED IN A MORE COMPASSIONATE AND OF LIFE EXPERIENCE BOTH FOR THOSE WHO CHOOSE AND HE TAKE THE OPTION. BUT ALSO FOR EVERYBODY ELSE- IN ADDITION SINCE CALIFORNIA- IMPLEMENTED THIS LAW FIVE OTHER STATES HAVE PASSED VERY SIMILAR LEGISLATION AND WE KNOW FROM EXPERIENCE THAT CALIFORNIA SUCH A ROUGH ROBUST IN LARGE AND DIVERSE STATE. TAKING THIS IMPLEMENTING THIS LEGISLATION WAS ONE OF THE REASONS THAT GAVE THOUGHT THAT WAS LAWMAKERS COME SO ON BEHALF. START CALIFORNIA SUPPORTERS BUT ARE SO IT'S NATIONWIDE AND LIKE TO EXPRESS THANK. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANKS VERY MUCH I'M- YEAH WHAT WAS THINGS THAT YOU MENTION ARE MMHM MY OFFICE AND I'M SURE CENTER MONIES OFFICER OTHERS GET GET A LOT OF CALLS AND MY CHIEF OF STAFF SPENT BROKEN OUT ARE ON THE PHONE SOMEBODY CHRISTMAS EVE WHO WAS AT THAT IN A TRUCK THAT SECOND POSITION KNOWING THAT IT WAS GOING TO NOW BE AFTER THE YEAR BEFORE ANYTHING COULD HAPPEN. I'M SO WE HAVE CERTAINLY HEARD THOSE STORIES. AND SEEMINGLY AND ON BE INTERESTED TO HEAR WHAT WE HEAR FROM HEALTH SYSTEMS- DIFFERENCES ACROSS THE STATE. HAS BEEN. ALSO OF INTEREST TO US- AND SO WE KNOW WHAT. A TO POINT WE HAVE TO COME BACK TO REVISIT. YOU KNOW WE HAVE A SUNSET COMING UP IN AND AT THAT POINT PERHAPS SOME CHANGES TO BE MADE BUT WE'VE ALL BEEN VERY RESISTANT TO. OPEN THIS BAG FOR CHANGES UNTIL- WE'RE VERY SURE OF THE DATA OF WHAT WOULD BE. THE MOST COMPASSIONATE WAY. OF GOING FORWARD- AND WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE ALL THE SUPPORT FROM COMPASSION CHOICES REALLY SERVING AS A HUB FOR FAMILIES. IN NEED- AND WILL. THE TERM. THANK YOU I WANNA THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY MORE IMPORTANTLY THANYOUR TESTIMONY TODAY THE WORK YOU'RE DOING EVERY DAY NOW IN I'M FOLLOW UP. BEGIN AMENDMENT ON THE FIFTEEN DAY WAITING PERIOD. IT'S NOW DISCRETIONARY WITH THE ATTENDING PHYSICIAN LIFE HERE SHEEN DETERMINES THAT THAT FIFTEEN DAY WAIT WOULD BE ONEROUS- THEY HAVE THE AUTHORITY- AND THEN I THINK YOU MENTIONED A COUPLE OF OTHER STATES THAT ARE ALSO. NOT REQUIRING THE FIFTEEN DAYS THERE'S TWO STATES THAT HAVE LEGISLATION PENDING IN NEW YORK AND I THINK IT'S MINNESOTA THAT- WOULD ELIMINATE IT BUT IT'S NOT PASSED YET OKAY. MOM BUT THOSE ALSO MIGHT PROVIDE A MODEL OF- HOW PEOPLE ARE APPROACHING IT LEGISLATIVELY- COULD CERTAINLY WE HAVE HEARD IN OUR OFFICES IN IN THE HEARING THAT. THE CHAIR HOSTED LAST YEAR. THAT WAS THE TESTIMONY THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF COERCION OF. BAD OUTCOMES- ALL OF THE FOCUS WAS PEOPLE WHO WERE THE IMPEDIMENT WAS THE FIFTEEN DAYS SO I THINK THAT CERTAINLY GOING TO BE ON OUR RADAR FOR ANY- FUTURE- IN THE LEGAL ARENA YOU DIDN'T REALLY ADDRESS THIS BUT- WE'VE- FACE CHALLENGES IN CALIFORNIA. ON THE ATTORNEY GENERAL DEFENDS CALIFORNIA'S LAW IN HAS BEEN DOING A GREAT JOB OF DOING THAT I'M ARE THERE WHAT'S THE STATUS OF ANY OTHER LEGAL CHALLENGES NATIONALLY OR- OTHERS PENDING IN CALIFORNIA- SO OUT IN CALIFORNIA- JUST FOR I'M SURE YOU KNOW BUT FOR THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW- THE CASE- IN THE DISTRICT COURT- JUST FOUND THAT THE LAW WAS PASSED CONSTITUTIONALLY. AND THAT THE OPPOSITION DID NOT- HAVE STANDING TO BRING ALL THE OTHER CLAIMS FORWARD OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT TODAY- THAT COURT CASE IS SUPPOSED TO- THERE THE OPPOSITION IS ABOUT ELENA. ST I'M DISTRICT COURT LEVEL WHAT THAT AMENDED COMPLAINT WILL SAY BUT THAT'S SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN TODAY AND IF IT HAPPENS AT SOME POINT WHILE WE'RE HERE WHAT WILL LET YOU KNOW- IN TERMS OF NATIONAL LAWSUITS- THERE IS A LAWSUIT IN NEW JERSEY- A DOCTOR IS CLAIMING YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO- OR FOR. OR HANDLE MEDICAL. AND THAT EVEN THAT IS A VIOLATION OF HIS CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT AND THAT THE LAW- AS PAST SHOULD NOT BE- VALID OR LEGAL- SO THAT'S MAKING ITS WAY THROUGH THE COURTS- AS WELL IN NEW JERSEY THOSE ARE THE ONLY TWO STATES THAT HAVE THIS SPECIFICALLY CHALLENGED- THE BIGGER THING THAT'S TAKING PLACE WITH. WHICH THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS BEEN VERY INVOLVED IN IS THE HHS OFFICE OF CIVIL. RIGHTS AND- THAT OFFICE THE REGULATIONS THAT CAME OUT ON IT REALLY- GIVE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WEIGHT. TO A DOCTOR'S- ABILITY TO AND DOCTORS AND NURSES HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS ANYONE WHO ACCESS IS THE PATIENT. THEIR BILITY TO OPT OUT OF PARTICIPATING IT'S TO THE POINT THE WAY THEY'RE WRITTEN WHERE A PERSON A SECRETARY COULD CHOOSE NOT TO TURN OVER THE PRESCRIPTION THAT AND NOT TELL ANYONE THAT THAT'S WHAT THEY'VE DONE. FORTUNE THE- ATTORNEY SPEND AWAY. DOES NOT. DID YOU SEE THAT SHIPPED PLAY I NASH AND SOMETHING WE'RE PAYING ATTENTION TO AND TRY TO AVOID GOOD WILL THANK YOU FOR THAT UPDATE NINETY ONE AND JUST ON THE RECORD ACKNOWLEDGE THE SUPPORT OF GOVERNOR NEWSOME'S OFFICE AND ATTORNEY GENERAL HAVE YOU EVER SANTA WHO HAVE BEEN REPRESENTING THE STATE IN DEFENDING THE LAW IN I KNOW COMPASSIONATE CHOICES HAS AS WELL. SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. KIM THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALL THE ENERGY AND EFFORT THAT SINCE HE HAS DONE. NOT ONLY IN OUR STATE BUT- NATIONALLY- I WANTED TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT- THE DIFFERENT SYSTEMS AND- WHETHER- IN OTHER IN ANY OF THE OTHER TEN- EXPERIENCES STATE EXPERIENCES. THERE IS ANY KIND OF. MORE THAN ENCOURAGEMENT BUT MANDATE TO REFER. OR TELL ABOUT THE LAW- WE DON'T HAVE THAT IN HOURS AND WE DELIBERATELY LEFT OUT- BECAUSE THERE WAS CONCERN ABOUT THAT ON- MANY OF UNFUNDED PROFESSIONALS. OUT PARTS BUT AND THE INSTITUTIONS BUT I'M WONDERING WHETHER THERE'S BEEN ANY PROGRESS IN THIS AREA. THERE ARE NOT NONE AT ALL OF THE STATES HAVE THE SAME OP AT THE SAME- SAME OPT OUT YEAH THE AND THE CHALLENGER- WITH A MANDATORY. OUT WHY THINK YOU COULD PROBABLY DO A MANDATORY WERE FOR ALL MADE TO A GOVERNMENT WEBSITE YES- THE- THAT'S EXACTLY THE- IT ALLEN'S ALLEN THAT WERE SEEN AROUND RELIGIOUS FREEDOM VERSUS PAID NOT LET ME AND- THAT. BE BALANCED WAY UP TO THE SUPREME COURT AND SO. HOW YOU GET AND I'M REALLY HOPEFUL THAT THAT MIGHT BE SOME AT- WELL. WILLING TO TAKE ON OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVE AN ATTORNEY GENERAL WHO IS BILLS REALLY STRONGLY THAT PATIENT SHOULD HAVE. A VOICE AND THAT A DOCTOR'S- SORT OF- DOCTORS CAN OPT OUT SHOULD NOT OVER. FOR IN. THAT WOULD BE GREAT TO LOOK AT INNOVATIVE WAYS TO DO DEL PROBLEM. THE CLOSEST WITH THE PROVISION THEY HAVE IN THEIR BILL- BUT- NO ONE HAD NO ONE IS AUTHORIZED LEGISLATION THAT HAS. REALLY ADDRESSED THE ISSUE. I'VE NOTICED THAT OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS SINCE HE HAS SPENT A GREAT DEAL OF BOB. EFFORT TALKING ABOUT HOW ALZHEIMER'S AND PARKINSON'S. AND I'M CURIOUS AS TO WHERE YOUR ORGANIZATION IS AT THIS POINT WITH THE TEN STATES AND THAT ISSUE SURE- AND THAT IS INCIDENTLY WHEN PEOPLE COME TALK TO ME ABOUT THIS BILL HERE THAT IS THE MAJOR ISSUE THAT SENIORS BURN UP ALL THE TIME. YEAH I MENTION YEAH SO WE CAN OPERATE OUT MEDICAL AID IN DYING FROM HOW TO ADDRESS ALZHEIMER'S AND DEMENTIA AS YOU KNOW FROM PASSING THIS LOG BOOK POOR SAFEGUARDS THAT ARE PART OF MEDICAL AID IN DYING IS THAT THE PERSON HAS TO BE MENTALLY CAPABLE AND ABLE TO SELF AND JUST THE MEDICATION- AND- IF YOU IMAGINE GIVEN THE INEQUITY. THAT WE HAVE WITHIN OUR HOW. DUMB BEAT. THAT MIGHT HAVE IF WE WERE TO EXTEND THAT TO- SOMEBODY WHO'S LOOKING YOU LOOK AT THE COUNTRIES THAT ARE DOING THAT ENTIRELY DIFFERENT ECONOMIC AND HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS- BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE SHOULD ALLOW PEOPLE WITH DEMENTIA TO DIE IN THERE ARE EGGS ACTUALLY LEGAL EXISTING OPTIONS RIGHT NOW THAT SOMEBODY. RIGHT NOW WE'RE KEEPING PEOPLE I FOR DECADES YAWNED YEAR WHICH THEY COULD THANKS **** THAT. BECAUSE YOU KEEP SENDING LIFE YOU THAT AND PEOPLE ARE OUT RIGHT. TO CLAIM THAT IS WE JUST PUT TOGETHER ON. THAT HOUSE UP TO GO. SITE PER JUDY ANY OF YOUR CAN. IT'S FOR. THEY CAN DOT THE POINT AT WHICH THEY WOULD ONE OR GO TO. AT THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM REALIZE A NATURAL DEATH AND IT WILL CUT YEARS OF THEIR- YOU KNOW IT'S THINGS LIKE DON'T GIVE SOMEBODY THE END OF. IF THEY GET IN. OR IF THEY HARPER YOU DON'T HAVE TO KEEP GIVING THEM THE HEART MEDICATIONS THERE'S ALL KINDS OF WAYS THAT WE CAN SHORTEN THE LENGTH OF TIME SOMEONE SUFFERS WITH TO. I'M DO A BADGE AND THAT AT SOME POINT- YOU'RE GONNA HAVE THE SAME IMPLEMENTATION PROBLEM WITH THAT YOU HAVE WITH MEDICALLY TO DINE IT'S COMPLETELY LEGAL. BUT GETTING A SYSTEM TO SUPPORT YOU WILL BE A CHALLENGE SO WE WOULD LIKE TO AND SOME BRING LEGISLATION THAT PROTECTS. BEARS THAT MAY IT THAT HELPS. BEFORE COMFORTABLE HONORING PATIENTS WHICH IS AND SO THAT'S NOT SOMETHING WE'VE AT THE THING I'M DOING AND- YEAR'S THANK YOU THANK. TALK LITTLE. IT IS IN. OR STATE JUST JUST. NEW MAN CO UP HERE IN HOT. THAT THE YOU DON'T NEED FOR THE FIFTY DAYS TO IT. SAID YOU BUT JUST LAST WEEK IT'S LIKE. I HAVE A- THIS TIME THEY'RE IN A YEAR. OKAY. OKAY END IS IT A FAIRLY CONSISTENT ACROSS THE COUNTRY THE SAME. POPPING OUT OF POSITIONS THAT SAME LEVEL AS WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA IN YEAH UNFORTUNATELY IT'S THE SAME THING AND IT IT- IT'S CHALLENGING- BECAUSE YOU KNOW DOCTORS DO HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE ABLE TO OPT OUT I BELIEVE THAT- AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT CALIFORNIA'S LAWS AROUND THAT BUT I DO THINK THAT- EIGHT RN'S WILL TRANSPORT FROM THIS. YES SO WHY HE IS THE FIRST STATE THAT'S REALLY I THINK THEY HAVE A GOOD SHOT OF PASSING AT THIS LEGISLATION THIS LEGISLATIVE SESSION AND NURSES ARE ABOUT CURING THEY'RE NOT ABOUT YOU KNOW ABOUT HEALING AND PROLONGED NEED AND SO THEY REALLY UNDERSTAND AND THE EXPIRY OF A DOT PERSON AT A FLIGHT YOU KNOW HAD A BAD AND WITH THEM AND HAVE. PORTS THAT CEDAR IS SO WHAT HELP LAWS THAT'S AND THAT WOULD FOR. I HEAR. PR INS ARE NOW NOT IN HEALTH. YEAH WELL YEAH HADN'T ONCE I DON'T SEE OF BUT I DON'T I DON'T SEE WINGS. THE LEAD TO FULL. YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YET. YEAH THE- OKAY NEED OF SUMMER FRAZIERTHE- I'M OKAY AGAIN THANK YOU FOR ALL ALL THAT YOU DO AND ALL THAT YOU'LL CONTINUE TO DO- ANNA AND WILL CONTINUE TO USE YOU AS A RESOURCE AND RESPECT AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK. THANK YOU THANK. PROVIDER PANEL THAT DOCTOR CATHERINE FOREST DR RYAN. STE HE'LL TELL ME HOW TO SAY HIS NAME AND THEN DOCTOR PIRRIE PATEL. WELCOME ALL AND FOR THE AUDIENCE SAKE THEY'LL INTRODUCE THEMSELVES WE HAVE REPRESENTATION FROM STANFORD SETTER AND KAISER SOME OF THE SOME OF OUR FOLKS WHO HAVE BEEN PARTICIPATING WITH US- SO DOCTOR PATEL. HI YES GOOD MORNING- THINKS HAVING ME AT. SO MANY MISS PERKY PATEL AMY PALLIATIVE CARE PHYSICIAN I KNOW IT LISTEN IT'S LISTEDON THE AGENDA THAT I'MWITH KAISER SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR I HAVEN'T STARTED MY CLINICAL WORK- WITH THAT TEAM YET- BUT I WAS ALSO THE CO CHAIR OF THE END OF LIFE OPTION EXCEPT COMMITTEE AND THE LEAD FOR PHYSICIAN EDUCATION. CITY OF HOPE AT THE CAMPUS AS WELL AS THE SATELLITE LOCATIONS- DURING MY TIME WITH THAT INSTITUTION. SO MY EXPERIENCES ARE GOING TO BE FROM TIME AT CITY OF HOPE OKAY- THE FIRST PATIENT THAT REQUESTED MEDICAL AID IN DYING FROM ME I WAS IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN- AND I WHAT IS. AN CURRENTLY NERVOUS AT FIRST- IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE SO AT WITH THE OUT. I REMEMBER THE SHUTTLE VERY TO. I ONLY ABOUT A WONDERFUL LIFE A VERY FULFILLING LIFE A LOT OF FAMILY. HAVING EVERYTHING YOU COULD EVER WANTED OF THE STATE AT THAT TIME. BECAUSE HIS DUTIES I WAS DESCRIBING TO ME THAT HE HAD LOST ALL HIS DIGNITY. I'M HE HAD LOST HIS PURPOSE AND HE NO LONGER FOUND ENJOYMENT IN LIFE. AND HIS DAUGHTER IS ADULT DAUGHTER WHO HAD ACCOMPANIED HIM THAT VISIT. WAS GOING A LOT OF WHAT HER FATHER WAS SAYING AND- SHE WAS A PRO. YOUR FULL. OKAY I. KNOWING THE OF STE WILL VERY SO THE AND A MAN HER FATHER HAD BEEN A WHILE SHE WOULD CERTAINLY MISS HIM WOULD WANT NOTHING MORE THAN FOR HIM TO REGAIN SOME OF THAT CONTROL THAT THE CANCER HAD TAKEN AWAY FROM HIM FOR SO MANY YEARS I MEAN THAT WAS VERY TOUCHING VERY MEANINGFUL ON TEAM HERE THAT FROM HER- AND THIS LAW IT'S- AWFUL TO ME IT'S A LOT OF SUPPORT I HAVE MY OWN BELIEFS AND PASSIONS OF WHY WENT INTO MEDICINE AT PACIFIC LEE INTO A POT OF CARE. THERE'S A LOT OF TIME WE WORK WITH PATIENTS THAT HAVE A CHRONIC AND DEBILITATING ILLNESSES WHERE WE ARE FORTUNATELY INTO A IS THAT WE'RE NOT ABLE TO OFFER MEDICAL TREATMENTS AND THAT THERE IS BALK CAN YOU TO ARM MAKE THEM DECLINE SLOWLY INTO RATE AND THIS LAW I WAS THAT RETAIN SOME OF THAT CONTROL ABLE TO USE. THANK WANT TO LIVE WITHOUT HELLO ROLL I'M RATHER THAN LETTING THE DISEASE DO THAT FOR THEM. OUR WITH MIKE'S. I WOULD CAN PAY BUT- SEE WHAT END STAGE. DOES TO SO. IS A IS A TERRIBLE THING TO WITNESS- SEEING THEIR FAMILIES WATCH THEM SLOWLY DECLINE. IS EVEN MORE DIFFICULT AND- BEING ABLE TO ALLOW SOMEONE TO CHOOSE HOW THEY WANT TO DIE WHEN WE- WANT TO A LOT LET THEM CHOOSE HOW THEY WANT TO LIVE I THINK IS A VERY VERY IMPORTANT THING. I'M SO THEY CAN KEEP SOME OF THE NITTY. TO ME I. AT SOME OF THE STUFF THAT A LOT OF THESE PATIENTS ARE THEY'RE GOING TO INTO OR WHETHER PHYSICAL OR EMOTIONAL. OF SOME OF THE BARRIERS I'VE ENCOUNTERED- AS I THINK CAME AS ALREADY MENTIONED. ARE I DON'T THINK WE HAVE ENOUGH PARTICIPATING PROVIDERS- IN MY EXPERIENCE THAT HAS BEEN. BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S JUST A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING MAYBE OF THE LAW- FROM THE PROVIDER STANDPOINT- AND UNCERTAINTY ABOUT WHAT THAT PROCESS LOOKS LIKE. AND I THINK THAT WILL GET BETTER AS WE'VE HAD MORE DATA AND MORE EXPERIENCES WITH THESE PATIENT. COUNTERS AND SEEING THESE GOOD OUTCOMES I THINK THAT THAT WILL CHANGE. AS WELL AS PROVIDING ON AFTER FOR EDUCATION FOR A PHYSICIAN COLLEAGUES I'VE ALSO FOUND A- PERIOD AGAIN AS AS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED BY THE TIME A PATIENT HAS COME TO ME. ARE THEY ARE INCREDIBLY ILL AND IT'S OFTEN DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO MAKE IT TO THAT FOLLOW UP APPOINTMENT. I'VE HAD EXPERIENCES WERE PATIENTS THAT HAD TO YOU KNOW BE BROUGHT IN ON GURNEYS. AND THEY TELL ME THAT IN ITSELF IS- VERY DEMORALIZING AFTER EVERYTHING THEY'VE ALREADY BEEN THROUGH. A OR THE ACTUALLY DIE IN THE PROCESS BEFORE THEY ARE ABLE TO MAKE IT'S THAT FOLLOW UP. I HAVE ONE PATIENT COUNTER SPECIFICALLY THAT- WAS VERY MEANINGFUL TO ME. I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF TAKING CARE OF THIS WOMAN. FOR ALMOST TWO YEARS OF VERY HIGHLY EDUCATED INDIVIDUAL- AND THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF HER DIAGNOSIS SHE WAS A VERY REASONABLE PERSON I'VE HAD VERY REAL EXPECTATIONS. FOR HER PROGNOSIS AS WELL AS FOR TREATMENT OUTCOMES. AND SHE KNEW AND SHE VERBALIZE TO ME THAT YOU KNOW MIRACLES RARELY IF EVER HAPPEN. ESPECIALLY YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT METASTATIC CANCER- BUT THAT SHE WAS. FOR WHAT. AS DISEASE SPREAD BODY I AND EVENTUALLY TO HER BRAIN SHE HAD REQUESTED MEDICAL AID IN DYING FROM ME AND WHEN SHE MADE IT TO HER SECOND VISIT I AND WE GIVE FOR THE PRESCRIPTION AND SHE HUGGED ME AND THANKED ME AND SAID YOU GAVE ME THE MIRACLE THAT I DIDN'T THINK I'D BE A- FIVE. SO YOU YOU FOR THE TIME VERY MUCH THANK YOU ON THE SO IN YOUR IN YOUR WORK DID YOU HAVE SOMEONE IN TO REFER HER TO. FOR THAT FOR THAT SECOND THAT FEATHER THAT FIFTEEN DAY WAITING PERIOD DID YOU MEAN WHAT WHAT WAS A PROCESS IN THE CITY OF HOPE FOR THE REFERRAL TO PLACE BUT SO WHAT WHAT WE'RE THERE ARE CURRENTLY DOING AT THE TIME- IS. YOU WOULD GET THE REQUEST- WE GET THE REQUEST FOR PATIENT I'M NOT ALL PHYSICIANS AT THE INSTITUTION OF COURSE ARE PARTICIPATING PROVIDERS- I WAS ONE OF THEM FOR ANY PATIENT TO AND SO WITH THAT REFERRAL WOULD COME TO ME I WOULD- THAT FIRST VERBAL AND THEN FROM THAT DAY THEY WOULD. THE SECOND VISIT WAS SET UP WITH MYSELF AS WELL AT THE SAME POSITION DURING THE FIRST AND SECOND VERBAL I'M AND WE WILL TRY OUR BEST TO MAKE THAT CONSULTING VISIT WHICH WOULD BE FOR. ANOTHER PHYSICIAN- ON EITHER THAT FIRST OR SECOND DAY TO JUST CONSOLIDATE THOSE VISITS I AND WE HAVE A LIST IN THE INSTITUTION ON FROM THE END OF LIFE OPTION EXCEPT COMMITTEE THAT I MENTIONED- KNOWS WHICH ARE PARTICIPATING ATTENDING PROVIDERS AND OR CONSULTING PROVIDERS. OKAY IT'LL COME EMBEDDED INTO THE SYSTEM CORRECT SO THE FIFTEEN DAY STARTED THE MINUTE THEY ASKED. ANOTHER THING THAT WE'VE HEARD AND- I THINK WHAT WILL ADDRESS THAT LATER- IS SOMEBODY MAKING% WANTING TO MAKE THAT FIFTEEN DAY REQUEST AND THEN THE PHYSICIAN SAY NO I DON'T DO THAT AND I'M HAVING A HARD TIME EVEN FINDING SOMEBODY ELSE WHAT COULD BE. ANOTHER TWO WEEKS BEFORE THEY FIND SOMEONE TO MAKE THAT INITIAL REQUEST FOR THAT FIFTEEN DAY STARTING NAY. A RE OUT. SO IT ACTUALLY WE ARE STARTED IN THE WOULD SEE. THE FIRST AT. PROVIDE AND THAT WAS PART OF MY EFFORT TO I WAS LEADER THE EDGE. I TARGETED ALL THE PHYSICIANS ON THE MAIN CAMPUS AS WELL AS THE SATELLITE. WE HAD TO SOCIAL WORKERS THAT WERE ALSO TRYING TO REACH OUT TO ANY. NON PHYSICIAN PROVIDERS. JUST TO SPREAD THE EDUCATION THROUGHOUT THE INSTITUTION. OF WHAT THE LAW WAS WHAT IT ENTAILED AND WHAT YOU COULD DO EVEN IF YOU YOURSELF DID NOT WANT TO PARTICIPATE. HOW YOU COULD GET YOUR PATIENT SEEN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE- AND SO WE DID NOT START WHEN THEY WHEN THEY- FIRST MENTIONED IT WOULD START WHEN FACT. FIFTEEN DAY. AND TIME WOULD START WHEN THEY SAW THEIR FIRST. VISIT WHICH WAS NOT ALWAYS WITH THEIR HEMATOLOGY ONCOLOGY PHYSICIAN. THE QUESTION FOR. THE AND I JUST WANNA SAY WHEN. YOU WHERE I WAS A HOSPICE SO SHE WORKER AND I'M ALL ON THEIR FORGET TO A PATIENT I HAD OUT IN. PATTERSON AND BEEN A SAID CANCER THROUGHOUT HER BODY AND WENT TO HER BRAIN INTO AND I'LL NEVER FORGET HER TELLING ME. I FEEL LIKE I'M STRAPPED ON A RAILROAD TRACK AND THE TRAIN IS COMING. IN LIKE TOWARD THE END AND SHE DID WHEN I SEE HER SHE JUST SHE WAS LIKE. WHO TELL THANK YOU FOR YOUR OKAY ADD DOCTOR FORCED I THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME AGAIN AND- I AM VERY LITTLE AT STANFORD AND MOSTLY TEACHING AT THE UCSAN FRANCISCO RESIDENT FAMILY MEDICINE RESIDENCY PROGRAM IN SALINAS AND MONTEREY COUNTY SOME MOSTLY WEARING MY UCSF HAT- AND I WANTED TO TELL YOU ABOUT TO RECENT- PATIENTS- I MOSTLY TEACHING THESE DAYS SINCE YOU LAST SAW ME- RECOGNIZING THAT SHORTAGE OF PRESCRIBING PHYSICIANS. I HAVE TAUGHT IN MENDOCINO COUNTY CINEMA COUNTY MONTEREY COUNTY SANTA CRUZ COUNTY- SAN LUIS OBISPO COUNTY- ALAMEDA COUNTY- AND FOR A FEW THERE'S A FEW MORE IN THERE- RECOGNIZING THAT THE SILOS OF LARGE PROVIDERS ARE ABLE TO SET UP SYSTEMS BUT THE SAFETY NET CONNECTS THE PEOPLE THAT ARE IN CATHOLIC SYSTEMS THAT AREN'T HAVING TRAININGS. DON'T HAVE ACCESS AND THE CALIFORNIA ACADEMY OF FAMILY PHYSICIANS WHO I'VE ALSO TAUGHT WITH RYAN IS TRYING TO DO OUTREACH TO TRY AND GET TO PRIMARY CARE WHICH IS WHERE PEOPLE OFTEN HAVE SOME OF THESE CRUCIAL CONVERSATIONS ABOUT SERIOUS ILLNESS AND ON- OPTIONS COUNSELING FOR THE END OF LIFE AND I WANT TO JUST HIGHLIGHT- UP FEATURE OF THE BILL THAT I REALLY APPRECIATE WHICH OF THE INCLUDES. TALKING ABOUT OPTIONS WE KNOW THAT THAT PEACE OF MIND IS I HAVE THIS BUT WHAT ABOUT ALL THESE OTHER THINGS THAT ARE ACTUALLY ON PEOPLE'S MINDS AND I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I'VE TAKEN THAT AND I BELIEVE THEN THAT THE CULTURE OF FAMILY MEDICINE WE TAKE THAT HEART THE THAT IS ONE OF THE THINGS WE- OKAY IN THE TRAY. SOUTH AND IF FOR THAT VERY SCARY. SO I DOING THIS TRY AT IT IT THE FIRST ONE I USE PATIENT THAT RE. UP CAME MY GOD COM THEY FAMILIES ME OF THE OF GONNA SHOW YOU THE BUT THEY DIDN'T WANT TO BE LIVE STREAMED ON LIKE TO SHOW YOU THE V. IT'S A PATIENT WHO IS A LIFELONG GOOD AS STE. WHO WHO'S PHYSICIAN WAS IN ONE OF MY TRAININGS AND MERCED FOR SAY MERCED COUNTY. ON AND WITH PALLIATIVE CARE FIFTH. AND AWAKENED THAT THIS COULD BE A POSSIBILITY- THIS PERSON ACTUALLY PARTICIPATED WITH IN MY TRAINING AND IN RYAN'S TRAINING SO PART OF THE SYSTEM OF TRAINING ONE ANOTHER. WROTE THE PRESCRIPTION AS A- THIS IS I HAVE THIS NEVER THOUGHT SHE WOULD USE IT BUT IN THE END STAGES FOR DISEASE WAS REALLY SUFFERING DALY. SUFFERING AND DECIDED THAT SHE WOULD TAKE IT SHE ALWAYS HER NAME IS JACK I WAS ALLOWED TO SHARE THAT HER NICKNAME IS CHAT. SHE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT SHE WOULD DIE WOULD WANT TO DIE TO THE SONG LEAVING ON A JET PLANE. IN THE VIDEO IS HEARD SINGING AND DANCING TO IT- SHE TOOK THE MEDICATIONS AS INSTRUCTED IN THE NEWEST ITERATION OF MEDICATIONS WHICH AGAIN THE SCIENCE IS A MERGING OF WHAT AND HOW CAN WE DO THIS MORE. AFFECTED WHAT ARE THE BEST PRACTICES LAST WEEKEND- RYAN WAS PRESENTING AT THE NATIONAL ON CONDITION CONFERENCE ON MEDICAL AID IN DYING WE KNOW MORE OF WHAT WORKS HOW TO DO IT- BOTH. EFFECTIVELY AND COST EFFECTIVELY ON AND SHE TOOK THE MEDICATION AND HAD GUTS- MONEY TO SEDATION AND PASSED AWAY WITHIN TWO HOURS WHICH IS OUR GOAL AT. NOT WHAT SHE THOUGHT. AND EXACTLY WHAT SHE LOVED AND HAD INCREDIBLE GRATITUDE FOR THE OPTION OF THIS ACCENT SO. I JUST WANTED TO ON THE SHAPE OF THE PROVIDER AND THEN. SHIP YOU KNOW THE PROVIDER WAS IN THE TRAINING OKAY SHE PRESCRIBED TO A PATIENT THE PATIENT'S FAMILY SENT ME THE VIDEO AND GAVE ME PERMISSION TO TELL THE STORY. SO THIS PATIENT LIVED IN A IN A RURAL AREA. NOT IN ONE OF THE BIG SITES THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR A YOU'LL HEAR MOST ABOUT NOT FROM A BIG AREA. BUT BECAUSE WE BEGUN TO DO THIS TRAINING LOOKING AT THE ACCESS PROBLEM- AND BY THE WAY HER RACIAL DOCTORS WERE IN THE CATHOLIC SYSTEM AND- LOOKED AT HER LIKE SHE WAS LIKE. NO ONE WAS GONNA HAVE THAT CONVERSATION WITH HER SHE DID NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THAT INFORMATION. SO ONE OF MY MAIN THINGS THAT I WANTED TO SAY WAS RIGHT NOW THE LAW DOES NOT SAY ANY PHYSICIAN IS OBLIGATED TO SAY A THING. IT SAYS PATIENTS HAVE ACCESS YOU KNOW HAVE THE RIGHT. TO IT BUT THERE'S NOTHING THAT SAYS ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR SO I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT COULD WE DO THAT IS THAT REALLY SPEAKS TO HEALTH. JUSTICE IN THIS STATE AND HEALTH JUSTICE AS IF YOU DON'T KNOW TO ASK. YOU WILL NOT FIND OUT SO HOW CAN WE REALLY LOOK AT THAT AND BE MORE PROACTIVE ABOUT HOW WE GIVE INFORMATION NOT ALL OPTIONS INCLUDING THE LEGAL AID AN OPTION DYING IN. MULTIPLE LANGUAGES. AND THAT BECAUSE OUR HEALTH SYSTEM REALLY DOES IS IT IS NOT ADDRESSING HEALTH JUSTICE INCLUDING THIS IN MY OPINION RIGHT NOW. AND THEN THE SECOND THING IS THAT IT REALLY DOES- PROCESS ITSELF IS BASED ON AUTONOMY WHICH IS ALSO NOT. PARTICULARLY CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE TO THE OTHER CASE I HAD HAD TO DO WITH A YOUNG BLACK NEXT PAGE MINE. WHO REALLY DID HIS FAMILY TO BE INVOLVED AND THE WAY THE SYSTEM IT WORKS IT. TO BE A RELATION I TIME ISSUE AND SO. WE WERE ABLE TO WORK THAT IS BUT JUST NOTE SELF. CAME UP VERY MUCH THROUGH. THE A PATIENT AUTONOMY PERSPECTIVE AND THAT MAY NOT BE APPROPRIATE FOR ALL POPULATION SO JUST WANT TO. HIGHLIGHT THAT WE PROBABLY WOULD MORE MOVING THROUGH IN CALIFORNIA WE COULD ACTUALLY. YOU KNOW WE INHERITED FROM OREGON AND WASHINGTON MAYBE PERHAPS NOT AS DIVERSE AS OUR OWN STATE AND WE HAVE OPPORTUNITIES HERE TO ADDRESS THAT AS WELL. AND YOU HAVE SPECIFIC IDEAS FOR BOTH YOUR FIRST AND YOUR SECOND POINT I'M LEARNING OKAY YEAH I LEARNING- SO THE ANSWER IS I BELIEVE. I DON'T HAVE THE ANSWERS BUT I KNOW SOME OF THE PEOPLE TO WORK WITH I'M THINKING OUT OF- TRACY BUSH AT IN AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IS. ONE OF PEOPLE I WOULD WANT TO WORK WITH AND THERE'S OTHER PEOPLE. ON IN SANTA CRUZ COUNTY BASED ON THIS WE'RE WORKING ON HOW CAN ALSO WE ADDRESS- PROVIDERS WERE TALKING ABOUT DOING TRAININGS THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF WORK AND HOSPICE AND PALLIATIVE CARE WHICH HAVE. THEIR SPECIALS HAVE LONGER TIME THAN PRIMARY CARE. AND THE NATION REMUNERATION IS VERY. INTENT ON WHAT YOU'RE DOING HOW MUCH TIME YOU HAVE DO IT. I WANT TWO. INNINGS THAT SPEAK TO THAT HOW CAN I DO TRAININGS THAT FIT IN THAT TIME. THE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN WORDS THAT WORK THE TRAINING THAT I DID- IN MONTEREY AND MERCED WAS WITH RACHEL BERNACCHI FOM THE TOOK ALIGN CENTER. AND IT WAS WORDS THAT WORK HOW CAN WE GET WORDS THAT WORK OUT INTO THE WORLD SO WE CAN HAVE CRUCIAL SHORT CONVERSATIONS BECAUSE THAT'S THE TYPE WE HAVE- BUT COULD WE WORK ON REMUNERATION SO IN PRMARY CARE FOR INSTANCE THE SAFETY NETS. OR YOU KNOW ACROSS HEALTH. YOU COULD HAVE MORE ROBUST CON. ABOUT ALL. I AM ASKED HAVE IN YOUR- IN YOUR- PAMPHLETS OR IN YOUR ON PACKETS. OCTOBER TWENTY NINETEEN STUDY FROM THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH CARE FROM. STEP ON END OF LIFE IN THAT WE'RE PEOPLE DOT AND WORK WITH ON IT I IS THEIR ACCESS TO. CARE AND HOSPICE SERVICE. NOT WERE YOU WANTED TO DIE NO HAVE THE CONVERSE. YOU WHY. BECAUSE OF YOU'RE POOR YOU SURE APPOINTMENT. AND PEOPLE DON'T HAVE TIME THE MATERIALS ARE AVAILABLE TO YOU YOU MAY NOT KNOW WHAT QUESTIONS TO ASK. SO AGAIN. PULLING THESE PIECES OUT WE KNOW THAT THERE'S SOME WORK TO DO THERE AND OUT ENCOURAGE YOU AND YOUR STAFF TO ACTUALLY READ THAT REPORTS OF IT'S AN EXCELLENT REPORT WITH A BIG DATA BASE LOOKING AT. HOW DO WE DO AT THE END OF LIFE AND WHAT CAN WE DO BETTER THIS IS ONE PIECE OF IT- SO I'LL END WITH THIS OTHER- STORY WHICH IS MY OWN FAMILY. I THINK- RELATIVE TO OTHER PHYSICIANS IN THE STATE I MIGHT KNOW A LITTLE BIT. ACCESS TO CARE MY UNCLE- CAME DOWN AFTER HOSPITALIZATION IN OREGON AND WASHINGTON- HAD HAD ACCESS TO CARE THERE AND END OF LIFE AND IT TURNS OUT. THERE'S NO RECIPROCITY. SO IF YOU START THE PROCESS IN ONE STATE AND YOU COME HERE YOU RESET THE CLOCK. AND IT WAS LOVELY HE HAD A LOVELY HOSPICE DEATH WELL SUPPORTED BY THE PALLIATIVE CARE COMMUNITY IN MY OWN CITY OF SANTA CRUZ. BUT IT MADE ME THINK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT AS WERE EXPANDING WITH ONE OUT OF FIVE AMERICANS NOW WITH ACCESS COULD WE ADJUST SO THAT IF YOU START SOMEPLACE ELSE COULD WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT AS STARTED IN OUR STATE- AND I WILL WOULD SAY I WOULD HAVE LOVED FOR HIM TO HAVE ACCESS HE WAS AT THE BEDSIDE FROM FROM MY AUNT WHO HAD A BEAUTIFUL- EIGHT AND DOT CRY IN THE SPOT. AID IN DYING- DEATH IN WASHINGTON HE WAS NOT AFFORDED THAT HERE IN HIS TIME BECAUSE HE NEEDED THE HELP OF OUR FAMILY AND HE CAME TO WHERE HE NEEDED HIS SOCIAL SUPPORT AND IT'S THE REVERSE OF WHAT WE HAD. A FIVE YEARS AGO AND ISN'T THAT INTERESTING AND ISN'T THAT WONDERFUL ALL AT ONCE SO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR FOR SITES IN YOUR WILLINGNESS TO CONSIDER IMPROVING ON WHAT IS ARTISTS BEGAN HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR ALL YOUR WORK AND DEDICATION AND IN SPREADING THE WORD AND HELPING OTHER PHYSICIANS I THINK THAT'S IT THE YOU TOUCHED ON SOMETHING VERY KEY AROUND THE ISSUE OF ACCESS AND I JUST LIKE TO ASK MAYBE FOR BOTH OF YOU BUT THE ISSUE OF THE IDEA CAME UP. BEFORE BUT IF YOU'RE IN HOT STAND OUT THAT COULD SEE AS- ONE THE ONE OF THE POINT IN TIME. BUT IT ARE THE ARE THE REALLY HOSP. ALSO NOT PARTICIPATING RIGHT SO IF THE IF THEY ARE PART OF THAT SAME SYSTEM THEN WE'RE FACED WITH SOME OF THE SAME HURDLES. I THINK THAT THE ISSUE IS ONCE A HOSPICE REFERRAL IS MADE THAT BY DEFINITION IS A SIX MONTH- SO IT IT'S. A QUALIFIER IT'S NOT THAT YOU RELY ON THAT HOSPICE. RIGHT BUT IT'S ONE OF THE QUALIFY EXCEPT. IT'S INSTEAD OF A- A VISIT IS THE POINT SO THAT'S THE IT THE ADVANTAGES THAT GIVES YOU THAT. BY THE WAY I THINK ALSO. JUST WATCHING PEOPLE THROUGH THE PROCESS- NOW THAT THAT WAITING PERIOD DOESN'T. MAKES IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE IT DOES DOESN'T MAKE SENSE HAVING TO PEOPLE'S THINKING CAPS. IS THIS. DOES IT IS THE SIM BAY TERMINAL DIAGNOSIS. THAT'S A SAFEGUARD BUT THE WAITING PERIOD IS NOT A SAFE GUARD. SAYS LIKE TO JUST TRYING TO RE EVALUATE WHAT WHY ARE WE DOING THIS IS A BARRIER TO CARE OR DOES IT SERVE A PURPOSE. WHAT'S THE POINT AND SAID IT'S A BARRIER TO CARE BUT THE HOSPICE REFERRAL THAT'S ACTUALLY WE'RE ALREADY DOING THAT IN OUR WORK OF. GO INTO COURT IN HOSPICE OR NOT. OKAY THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR LOOKING FOR TO HEARING YOUR TESTIMONY BUT I DO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE MY CONSTITUENT DOCTOR FOREST AND- TO JUST THANK YOU FOR THE OUT REACH YOU'VE DONE THROUGHOUT MUCH OF MY DSTRICT SAN LUIS OBISPO COUNTY INCLUDED. IN YOU TOUCHED ON THIS BUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ACCESS IN LARGE URBAN AREAS IN RURAL AND IT SEEMS LIKE SOME OF THE REFORMS WERE TALKING ABOUT WOULD ALSO FACILITY ACCESS IN RURAL AREAS IS THAT. CORRECT THAT'S TRUE AS WELL YES AGAIN GETTING TO WHEN YOU ONLY HAVE ONE PROVIDES CAME UP AND MEANT MENDOCINO COUNTY HOW CAN I SUPPORT THE MENDOCINO PHYSICIANS AND ONE OF THEM WAS YOU COULD JUST SAY YOU WOULD KNOW THAT THAT'S NOT WITH WE JUST IF WE EXPANDED ACCESS OR SHORTEN THE TIME PERIOD OR THIS MANY MANY DIFFERENT THINGS BUT YEAH. FOR CHEER WHEN THIS DOCTOR OF. IN IN NON ENGLISH LANGUAGE I KNOW COMPASSIONATE CHOICES PUBLISH SOME OF ITS MATERIALS. IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES HOW ABOUT HAVE YOU HAD ACCESS REGION OR THEIR SPANISH LANGUAGE MATERIALS THAT ARE AVAILABLE. FOR PATIENTS THERE ARE BUT AGAIN. THEIR AVAILABILITY IS DIFFERENT THAN ACCESS TO THEM IS THAT'S REALLY WHAT I'M THINKING SO RIGHT NOW. IF YOU KNOW IF I WOULD GO AND GET THOSE MATERIALS- IN AND THE CALIFORNIA ACADEMY OF FAMILY PHYSICIANS HASN'T UCLA HAVE I MEAN WE DO HAVE PATIENT EDUCATION MATERIALS IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES BUT THEY'RE ONLY AVAILABLE IF PEOPLE KNOW TECH ASK FOR THEM AND THAT'S THE HEALTH JUSTICE PIECE OF IT WHAT IS THE- WHAT IS OUR DUE DILIGENCE AND GETTING THOSE OPTIONS INFORMATION. AND BY THE WAY THIS IS NOT JUST EIGHT AND DYING THIS IS PALLIATIVE CARE AND HOSPICE AS WELL YOU KNOW FOR THOSE THAT YOU'VE WORKED ON HOSPICE THIS IS A BIG THING ABOUT HOW CAN WE TALK ABOUT HOSPICE IF YOU YOU IF IN THE REPORT THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT THEY TALK ABOUT WHEN WE DESCRIBE WHAT PALETTE OF KERR AND HOSPICES. PEOPLE SAY YES IF YOU JUST USE THE WORD PALLIATIVE CARE. NOW SO THAT'S HOW DO WE TALK ABOUT IT AND IS IT AVAILABLE TO EVERYBODY DO YOU HAVE TO ASK FOR. REPORTS IN ONE OF THE- POSSIBLE REFORMS AS WE MOVE FORWARD. REQUIRING EVEN NON PARTICIPATING INSTITUTIONS ARE PHYSICIANS IN END OF LIFE OPTION MINIMALLY BE REQUIRED TO MAKE MATERIALS AVAILABLE ABOUT THE RANGE OF OPTIONS- FOR THEIR CONSIDERATION- IN THEN YOU YOU REFERENCE GETTING BETTER ON THE COMBINATION OF MEDICATIONS AND AFFORDABILITY SPENDING ISSUE. IS THERE A COMBINATION OF MEDICATIONS THAT THE YOU CONSIDER TO BE THE BEST. THE BEST TOOL. YES WELL THERE'S A THERE'S SEVERAL DIFFERENT CHOICES BUT THAT LAST WEEKEND AT WAS IT LAST WEEK AND ALREADY MY GOODNESS TIME FLIES AT THE NATIONAL THERE'S A NEW NEW NATIONAL ACADEMY THAT'S FORM TO BE ABLE TO JUST TO WORK AND SCHERER- DATA TO BE ABLE TO WORK ON BEST PRACTICES- AND TO SHARE THAT INFORMATION SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO HONE ON THAT AND IT'S MORE WIDELY AVAILABLE NOW IN THE WE ARE NOT WE'RE WE'RE MOVING FROM YOU JUST HAVE TO KNOW WHO TO NOTE TO PRESCRIBE TO. THIS IS WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THIS MEDICATION AND HERE'S THE PHYSIOLOGY OF WHAT WE'RE WORKING WITH MOVING IN AND TO WEAR WORK SHOULD BE WHICH IS YOU KNOW BEST PRACTICES SO I THINK RYAN ACTUALLY MUCH MORE AT HIM SHE OR THEN IN THEM JUST MY FINAL COMMENT DOCTOR YOU REFER TO YOUR CURRENT TEACHING AT- IN MONTEREY COUNTY ATHLETIC DAD MEDICAL CENTER. PLACE NEAR AND DEAR TO MY HEART. YOU KNOW. I'M TO THANK YOU FOR THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING THERE THANK YOU FOR SOME MONTEREY COUNTY GETS ITS- I FEEL LIKE I'M BACK IN BACK WHERE I NEED TO BE IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. OKAY THE DOCTOR. SPIELVOGEL SEE I SAID THAT'S- SO FIRST I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY AND TO TALK ABOUT THIS REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE. SO MY NAME IS RYAN SPIELVOGEL I AM A FAMILY PHYSICIAN WITH SUTTER- HERE IN SACRAMENTO AND A FACULTY FOR THE CENTER FAMILY MEDICINE RESIDENCY PROGRAM HAS KIND OF THE MAIN PART OF MY JOB. I WANTED TO START BY JUST TELLING THE STORY OF THE FIRST PATIENT THAT I HAD GO THROUGH EMAIL AWAY. AND HE BASICALLY CAME TO ME IT LITERALLY ON THE DAY THE LAW WAS WENT INTO PRACTICE. HE WAS REFERRED TO ME AS NAMES PERCIVAL INTERESTINGLY YEAR- NAMED AFTER THE LEGENDARY NIGHT WHO SOUGHT THE FOR THE HOLY GRAIL- AND HE HE WAS A VERY AFFABLE MAN IN HIS LATE NINETIES. WHO HAD DEVELOPED IN STAGE KIDNEY DISEASE I AND TRIED DIALYSIS FOUND THAT HE FELT PRETTY MISERABLE ON THE DAY OF DIALYSIS AND ALSO THE DAY AFTER DIALYSIS WHICH IS FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO KNOW THE SCHEDULE OF DIALYSIS PRETTY MUCH EVERY DAY. SO HE MADE A VERY DIFFICULT DECISION OF TAKING HIMSELF OFF OF DIALYSIS AND EVERYBODY THOUGHT THAT HE WOULD PASS PRETTY QUICKLY BUT HE LASTED A LOT LONGER THAN PEOPLE HAD PREDICTED. AND JUST KIND OF SLOWLY LINGERED WITH PROGRESSIVE SYMPTOMS AS TOXINS BUILT UP IN HIS BODY. IT'S A HE CAME TO ME WHEN WAS PRETTY IMPAIR PHYSIC IMPAIRED ALREADY- WALKING WITH A WALKER WITH A DECENT AMOUNT OF ASSISTANCE- AND HE RELAYED TO ME I ASKED HIM WHY ARE YOU SEEKING THIS OUT. NOT KNOWING WHAT THE ANSWER WAS GOING TO BE- AND HE TOLD ME THAT HE WAS YOU KNOW A YEAR AGO PLAYING DOUBLES TENNIS. I AND- THAT NOW HE HE CAN'T GET OUT OF BED WITHOUT SOMEBODY HELPING HIM HE CAN'T GO INTO HIS GARDENING LIKE HE ALWAYS USED TO DO. AND BECAUSE OF THE TOXINS BUILDING UP IN HIS BLOOD HIS TASTE BUDS DIDN'T WORK ANYMORE AND EVERYTHING TASTED LIKE CARDBOARD. AND SO HEY THEN S. WILL OKAY WHEN DO YOU SEE YOURSELF TAKING THIS LIKE WHAT IS THE KIND OF. THE TIME FOR YOU BECAUSE I REALLY DIDN'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION WAS GONNA BE IN HE SAID. IN THIS IS INTERESTING THAT IT'S SOMETHING THAT I FREQUENTLY HERE IS THAT WHEN I AM UNABLE TO WIPE MY OWN BEHIND IT IS TIME FOR ME TO GO. WHICH IS A LITTLE TAKEN ABACK BY THAT- BUT I. WENT WITH IT IT'S NOT MY DECISION TO MAKE. I AND I SAW HIM AGAIN AFTER THE FIFTEEN DAY WAITING PERIOD- TWO AND A HALF WEEKS LATER- AND THEN HE DID IN JEST- THE AID IN DYING DRUG. SURROUNDED BY FRIENDS AND FAMILY. I AND I HEARD FROM THE DAUGHTER AFTERWARDS WHERE SHE SAID IT WAS AMAZING WE HAD A MEMORIAL FOR DAD WHILE HE WAS STILL ALIVE. AND SURROUNDED BY EVERYBODY HE WENT OUT WITH THE SUNSET ON HIS PORCH. WITH HIS FAVORITE MUSIC PLAYING. AND THAT IS REALLY UNIQUE AND I WASN'T REALLY EXPECTING THAT. BECAUSE PEOPLE BEFORE NOW I HAVEN'T REALLY BEEN ABLE TO PLAN THEIR- DEATHS- BUT THIS ALLOWS PEOPLE TO PUT THAT FINAL SENTENCE ON THAT LAST CHAPTER OF THEIR LIFE IN THE PERIOD ON THAT LAST. SENTENCE OF THE LAST CHAPTER. I'M SO WHAT DID I FROM PERCIVAL ONE THING IS THAT A DIGNITY IS IN THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER I I'M A DOCTOR AND SO WHEN HE TOLD ME THAT IN WRITING HIS OWN BEHIND WOULD BE KIND OF THE FINAL OKAY I'M DONE. MOMENT THAT'S NOT WHAT I WOULD HAVE CHOSEN BECAUSE TO ME THAT DIDN'T SEEM LIKE THAT MUCH OF A LOSS OF DIGNITY. BUT TO HIM THAT MEANT MY LIFE IS NO LONGER WORTH LIVING AND THAT'S NOT GOING TO COME BACK SO HE HAD BEEN IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE. IN HOSPICE THIS WHOLE TIME AND THEY'D BEEN MANAGING SOME OF HIS OTHER SYMPTOMS BUT THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT HOSPICE CANNOT MANAGE. FOR INSTANCE PROGRESSIVE DECLINE AND FUNCTIONING. HE'S NOT GONNA GET THAT BACK HE'S NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO PLAY DOUBLES TENNIS AGAIN. NO MATTER WHAT- AND AS AND LOSS OF DIGNITY AND LOSS OF DIGNITY IS NOT UP TO ME TO THE FINER FOR ANYBODY TO DEFINE IT'S UP TO YOU. SO AND BY THE WAY JUST A QUICK SIDE NOTE I DO TAKE ISSUE THAT SOMEHOW THE TERM DEATH DIGNITY HAS BECOME ASSOCIATED WITH MEDICAL AID IN DYING BECAUSE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN HOSPICE CAN OF DIGNIFIED DEATHS- WHO ARE. NOT IN HOSPICE IN CHOOSE TO JUST CONTINUE TO PLOW THROUGH WITH AGGRESSIVE CHEMO RIGHT UNTIL THE END THEY CAN HAVE A DIGNIFIED DEATH TO. DIGNITY IS UP TO USED TO DEFINE AND WHEN YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'VE LOST DIGNITY THAT'S THAT'S PERSONAL SMALLER WE HAD. I REMIND MYSELF NOW ANYTIME I SEE SOMEBODY WITH A TERMINAL CONDITION THAT- THE LIFETIME PREVALENCE TOO MUCH TO EVERYBODY'S SURPRISE THE LIFETIME PREVALENCE OF DEATH IS A 100% SO. EVERY HI IS. AND DEATH. BOTH IN IN TRANSIT IN THIS. THE THAT IT'S HAPPENED TO LITERALLY EVERYBODY. HIM THAT'S EVER EXISTED BIRTH AND DEATH. IT'S AN INTRINSICALLY UNIQUE ANY DEEPLY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE SO NO TWO DEATHS ARE THE SAME AND SO BEING ABLE TO GIVE PEOPLE ANOTHER OPTION FOR HOW THEY CAN EXPERIENCE IT IS IMMENSELY POWERFUL SO THAT WE DON'T JUST HAVE DISEASE WHAT WE CALL DISEASE DIRECTED CARE PLOWING THROUGH WITH CHEMO PLOWING THROUGH WITH DIALYSIS OR HOSPICE CARE COMFORT DIRECTED CARE TREATING YOUR SYMPTOMS ALLOWING THE DISEASE TO NATURALLY TAKE YOU. BUT ALSO GIVING YOU THE ABILITY TO SAY I'M ABOUT TO PASS ANYWAY SO LET ME DCIDE WHEN AND HOW THAT'S GOING TO BE. SO I WANT TO TALK NOW ABOUT- EARL OF THIS IS THIS PATIENT IS A LITTLE BIT UNIQUE IN MY EXPERIENCE IN THAT MOST OF MY PATIENTS ARE REFERRED TO ME- SO I KIND OF KNOW WHAT I'M GETTING WHEN I GO INTO THAT CONVERSATION- OUR GIRLS ACTUALLY ATION OF MINORS AS PRIMARY CARE DOCTOR. AND I HADN'T SEEN HIM FOR ABOUT TWO YEARS IN THE LAST TIME I'D SEEN HIM HE WAS PRETTY WELL AND THEN HE COMES TO ME AFTER RECENT HOSPITALIZATION HOSPITALIZATION I HADN'T KNOWN BUT IN THE INTERVAL HE DEVELOPED. SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA OF THE OF THE THROAT AND IT WAS METASTATIC CAN YOU HAVE BEEN THROUGH MANY ROUNDS OF CHEMO AND SOME SURGERIES- AND SO IS COMING TO ME FOR HOSPITAL FOLLOW UP. AFTER HE HAD SOME- SIDE EFFECTS COMPLICATIONS OF CHEMO. AND HE LOOKED HORRIBLE. AND HE HAD HAD METASTATIC CANCER THEM QUICKLY LEAFING THROUGH ALL OF THE ONCOLOGISTS NOTES FROM A DIFFERENT INSTITUTION WHICH IS SOMEHOW WHICH IS PART OF HOW I DIDN'T KNOW THAT THIS IT HAPPENS IS AT A DIFFERENT INSTITUTION. AND I'M LOOKING ALL MY GOSH HAS HE EVER HAVE THEY EVER HAD A GOALS OF CARE CONVERSATION WITH THIS GUY- WILL WHAT IS HIS PROGNOSIS AND EVERYTHING IN THERE SAYING LIKE HE'S TERMINAL. HIS PROGNOSIS IS POOR SO WE'RE GONNA SWITCHING OVER TO THIS OTHER CHEMO REGIMEN. AND MOVE FORWARD IN ELEVEN MRI TO FOLLOW UP TO SEE HOW MUCH HE'S PROGRESS TO THE CANCERS PROGRESSED IN ANOTHER SIX MONTHS. NOTHING IN THERE ABOUT GOALS OF CARE HAVING THAT CONVERSATION WITH HIM. SO YOU KNOW HE'S COMING TO ME TO TALK ABOUT HIS THE SEED OF COLITIS RECENT EPISODE IN THE HOSPITAL I SAY. EARL WE NEED TO TALK A LITTLE BIT LIKELY THIS IS MY LAST PATIENT ON FRIDAY SO I HAD SOME TIME. MY WIFE WASN'T VERY APPRECIATIVE THIS BUT I HAD SOME TIME. AND I SAY LET'S LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU WANT TO DO HERE BECAUSE HE'S LIKE WELL BUT MY ONCOLOGIST SAID. I NEED TO GET AN MRI IN SIX MONTHS- YOU DON'T NEED TO AND I KIND OF WENT THROUGH WITH HIM. HELLO WHAT I NORMALLY SAY OR PREVIOUSLY SAID ABOUT DISEASE DIRECTED CARE VERSES STE YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY SUFFERING ON THIS. SYMPTOM DIRECTED CARE AND BY THE WAY I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW THIS BUT IN CALIFORNIA NOW WE HAVE A THIRD OPTION. AND HE'LL KINDA GINGERLY BRINGING IT UP AND AS SOONAS I BRING IT UP HE GOES I WANT THAT. AND I SAID. GIRL I WASN'T REALLY EXPECTING YOU TO REACT THAT WAY YOU KNOW. HIS TO SOMETHING YOU CAN THINK ABOUT HE'S LIKE NO NO NO NO NO I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT THAT I COULD SAY NO TO THE CAME- LET ALONE THAT I COULD SAY THAT I'M DONE- SO. I'M DONE. I'M NOT GONNA HAVE A RECOVERY- I DID TALK HIM INTO TRYING HOSPICE FOR A LITTLE BIT TO SEE IF THEY COULD HELP WITH THE SYMPTOMS. AND HE DID TRY IT FOR A LITTLE WHILE AND THEN HE SAID NOPE. THAT WASN'T THAT WASN'T ENOUGH FOR ME I'M- DONE AND HE ENDED UP ALSO INGESTING. AND THROUGH WIFE AT THE TIME WAS CRYING IN THAT FIRST OFFICE VISIT. SHE WAS NOT ON BOARD BUT AGAIN AFTERWARDS I HEARD FROM HER- JUST HOW POWERFUL EXPERIENCE SO THAT WAS WHEN SHE- KIND OF ACCEPTED THAT HE WAS. AND HE ACCEPTED THAT HE WAS TYING A LOT FASTER THAN SHE DID. WHICH IS ACTUALLY VERY. CALM. FOR THE FAMILY. AS IN KIND OF. EVERY PAGE THAT I'VE HAD GO THROUGH THIS WITHOUT EXCEPTION. OF THE PATIENTS HAVE BEEN IMMENSELY APPRECIATIVE TO HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY AND TO HAVE ACCESS. AND THE FAMILIES HAVE BEEN AS WELL- EVERYONE TALKS ABOUT HOW POWERFUL THIS WAS AN EXPERIENCE AFTER THE FACT. SO KIND OF IN CLOSING. I JUST WANT TO MENTION HOW POURTANT LAW IS FOR. POWER BEING EVIL. AND DISENFRANCHISED POPULATION- OF PEOPLE WHO ARE DYING OF WHICH EVERYONE WILL ONE DAY BE. FEEL LIKE MEDICINE HAS LEFT THEM BEHIND. I SAID THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR BEING ABLE TO GIVE PEOPLE A BIT OF THAT POWER BACK. IT IS IRONICALLY ONE OF THE MOST REWARDING THINGS THAT I DO IN MY MEDICAL PRACTICE. BEING A PRIMARY CARE DOCTOR- IN I'D SAY IT'S RIGHT UP THERE WITH DELIVERING BABY IS AND WHO SOME OF THE CONTRACT. CARE THAT YOU. IT'S. ECHOING FEEL LIKE I'M GONNA ASK A LOT OF THINGS HAVE ALREADY COME UP- THE WAITING PERIOD I'VE HAD A NUMBER OF PATIENTS EITHER CALM WHEN THEY ARE TO THIS WHEN THEY ARE. PLANNING AHEAD. OF LIKE MY FIRST PATIENT PERCIVAL. OVER MANY OF MY PATIENTS OR WHEN THEY ARE. REALLY TERMINAL- WHEN THEY ARE ACTIVELY DYING AND YOU CAN NOW YOU KNOW AS THE PROVIDER WHEN YOU SEE THEM. OF THIS PERSON IS NOT GOING TO MAKE IT THROUGH THE WAITING PERIOD. I AND ABOUT HALF MY PATIENTS TELL. IF AND IF NOT A pTHE EARLY DAYS AND NOW IT'S A LITTLE BIT LESS THAN HALF I'D SAY- SO THAT THAT IS ONE PARTICULAR BARRIER. ANOTHER ONE IS ACCESS- PROVIDERS MANY PROVIDERS EITHER ARE COMFORTABLE OR WHEN I TALK WITH THEM BECAUSE I DO A LOT OF TRAININGS WITH THE CLINICIANS OTHER CLINICIANS AND CENTER MEDICAL GROUP- THEY JUST. HAVE THIS IDEA THAT ALL AGES HERE IT'S REALLY COMPLICATED. AND THEN I TRIED TO DISPEL FOR THEM BREAK DOWN INTO LIKE. A REALLY THAT COMPLICATED JUST TO INFORMED CONSENT THIS GOT IN WITH. LIKE IF EVERY NICHOLS. AND HERE THEY STE. OF I'M FACT FOR AS PRO SO A LOT OF MY RESIDENTS ARE. VERY INTO. IN THIS PROCESS AND OVER HALF OF THEM ACTUALLY ARE TAKING PART IN SEEING PATIENTS- AND SO THAT HAS BEEN GREAT FOR TRAINING THAT'S OUR NEXT GENERATION OF PHYSICIANS- BUT ALSO. I THINK WITH DOCTOR PATEL KIND OF BROUGHT UP WHEN YOU GUYS WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW. THE FIRST VERBAL REQUEST WHICH YOU WOULD THINK IS THE FIRST VERBAL TO REQUEST WITH THE PATIENCE THING IS THE FIRST VERBAL REQUEST IS NOT ACTUALLY IN THE EYES OF THE LAW THE FIRST VERBAL REQUEST. SO FROM MY STANDPOINT IN THE LAW YOU HAVE TO BE SITTING IN FRONT OF ME. AND TELL ME THAT YOU WANT A MEDICATION TO HELP YOU AND YOUR LIFE. AT THE PATIENTS ALREADY SAID THAT BEFORE. THEY SAID THAT TO THEIR OWN PRIMARY CARE DOCTOR. RELEASE SAID THAT TO THEIR THEIR OWN ONCOLOGIST I'M DONE I WANT THAT THAT DEATH WITH DIGNITY THING. THEY'VE SAID THAT ALREADY AND FREQUENTLY THEY SAID THAT LIKE ONE OR TWO MONTHS AGO ALREADY. AND THEN THE ANSWER THAT THEY GRAVEL AS WELL I DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW TO DO THAT OR YOU KNOW I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHO YOU GO TO FOR THAT. AND SO THEN THEY COME TO ME AND THEY SAY WELL I'VE ALREADY GIVEN THREE VERBAL REQUESTS. THEY SAY WELL IN THE EYES OF A LOT IT DIDN'T ACTUALLY COUNT. SO THEN THEY HAVE TO DO IN A- DIRECTIONAL. FIFTEEN DAY WAITING PERIOD WHEN THEY'VE ACTUALLY IN. IN FACT ALREADY BEEN WAITING. A COUPLE OF MONTHS. SETS ONE BARRIER ANOTHER BARRIER. AND THEN I'D SAY THE THIRD THAT I JUST WANT TO MENTION HIS. I GET A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE COMING TO ME FROM THREE FOUR HOURS AWAY. FROM YOU I'VE HAD PEOPLE COME TO ME FOR ME OF SAMITY OR NEAR THE OREGON BORDER BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE SOMEONE CLOSER. AND THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE. SUFFERING AND HAVE A LOT OF PHYSICAL LIMITATIONS. A AND SO MAKING THEM SCHLEP THEIR WAY DOWN TO SACRAMENTO SO THAT THEY CAN SIT WITH ME FOR THIRTY MINUTES OR FORTY FIVE MINUTES. IS ALSO ON DECK. FIVE AND SO. HAVE NOW. WE HAVE THESE ONE DEVICES WE CAN HAVE A VIDEO CONFERENCE WITH SOMEBODY. ALL OF THEM ALSO HAVE THESE WONDERFUL DEVICES. SO YOU CAN HAVE A FACE TO FACE WITH SOMEBODY IN THEIR BED IN THEIR HOME WHERE THEY DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE TO COME TO YOU AND UNDERGO MORE SUFFERING JUST TO BE ABLE TO GET THIS THING THAT'S POSSIBLY. LESSENING THEIR SUFFERING. SO THAT'S ANOTHER POTENTIAL LIMITATION IN ALL OF THIS IS NOW WE HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY YOU CAN VIEW SOMEBODY YOU CAN SEE THEIR LIVING ENVIRONMENT YOU CAN SEE THEIR FUNCTION. MOTHER SO IN THE COMFORT OF THEIR HOME BUT CURRENTLY THAT'S NOT REALLY EXPLOSIVELY. ALLOWABLE AND IT'S SOMETHING ANOTHER AREA WE CAN IMPROVE. I'M UNDER MUCH THANK YOU- AGAIN IT'S ONE THINK ALL THREE OF YOU FOR NOT ONLY YEAR IMMEDIATE SERVICE YOUR PATIENCE BUT HELPING TO EDUCATE OTHERS ON. DOCTOR SPIELVOGEL I'M CURIOUS OR FOR ANY OF YOU VETERANS ADMINISTRATION WHAT'S HAPPENING TO VETERANS WHOSE CARE IS PROVIDED THROUGH THE VA FEDERALLY FUNDED ARE DOCTORS MAKING REFERRALS AT AT THE VA. I HAVE NOT HAD ANY REFERRALS AT THE VA BUT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT HE WITH REFERRALS OR NO IF SOMEONE HAS MEDICARE. MEDICARE HAS EXPLICITLY SAID THAT YOU CAN BILL FOR THIS SO IT'S ALL OUT OF POCKET OR OUT OF OUR POCKET ANYWAY. SONO NO Vì ã PAYMENT YEAH SO I'VE HAD VA PATIENTS AND WHAT HAPPENS IS THEY CONTACT THEY DO WHAT PEOPLE DO WHICH IS TO TRY AND FIND OUT WHO IS IN THERE IN THE CONCIERGE OR THE DIRECT CARE WORLD THAT THEY CAN ACCESS SO THE ACCESS BECOME FINANCIAL BARRIER. AND THEN AND OR OR CAN MAKE ACCESS IT THROUGH THEIR- IN SOME OTHER WAY SO YOU CAN GET ALL OF THE VISITS COVERED BY MEDICARE BECAUSE THAT'S JUST AND OF LIFE COUNSELING. SO ALL THE VISITS CAN COUNT BUT AT THE POINT WHEN THE PRESCRIPTION IS WRITTEN THAT'S AN UNCOVERED VISIT SO THAT'S THE WAY THE WORK AROUND HAS BEEN AS- BECAUSE- THE LAW. INCLUDES END OF LIFE COUNSELING AND- THAT THAT THAT IT IS IN THE COUNSELING PIECE OF IT BUT USING FEDERAL DOLLARS FOR THE ACTUAL PRESCRIPTION CAN'T. NO NO. IN TO BE SELF MOTIVATED TO LOOK TO DO WE KNOW IF DOCTORS WITHIN THE VA SYSTEM ARE MAKING PATIENTS- AWARE OF THE OPTION EVEN IF THEY CAN'T PROVIDE IT I ENVY I DON'T I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT. I DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION NO AND I CAN'T I DIDN'T. I DON'T KNOW THE AND ADDS THAT THAT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO FIND OUT I MEAN IT'S NOT DIFFERENT THAN OTHER THINGS THAT HAVE A RESTAURANT AND SLIKE. AMINA MEDICAL MARIJUANA OR YOU KNOW CUT CONTRACEPTIVE SERVICES ARE THAT FOR- AND PORTION SERVICES AND THINGS LIKE THAT BUT I DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW. THE REGION I REPRESENT THERE'S- VETERANS SENT A LOT OF VIETNAM VET SINCE WE'RE A- IN MAY WHO HAVE. DEVELOPED SOME OF WHOM BELIEVE THEY'RE RELATED TO THEIR SERVICE. BUT IF. THE NEEDS TO ME MAYBE. A BETTER. OF JUST PUBLIC EDUCATION SO THAT THEY'RE NOT DEPENDENT ON LEARNING OF OPTIONS IN THEIR CURRENT CARE SYSTEM OF FOR HAVE A PURPOSES I WROTE ABOUT OF FAT IN MY VOX PIECE I WROTE A PIECE ABOUT AID IN DYING IN A VOX ARTICLE. IN IT'S A COMPOSITE OF THREE VETERANS- ALL OF WHOM FOUND ME PRIVATELY AND- USED THEIR SUPPLEMENTAL INSURANCE TO ACCESS ME AT STANFORD. SO WE'RE NOT THERE ACE SAYS ORDER DO THAT. AND MEDIC AS COVER SPIT SERVICE. BUT WORK AROUND YOU'LL THIS LATER THE WORKER. HAVING TO DO WITH AID IN DYING OR NEW RIGHT I'M NO AT. HERE FOR THOSE THE HAWK. THANK YOU. BOMB SO TO ALL OF YOU I'M AND WE'VE HEARD OF THIS FIFTY DAY REPEAT SO SOUNDS LIKE YOU THINK THE FIFTY DAY NOT NECESSARY. BUT HOW ABOUT THAT HOW ABOUT SEEING TO PHYSICIANS. IS THAT. ARE I ACTUALLY THINK THAT THAT IS NECESSARY- ACT. CASH IN THE- FIFTY TO SIXTY YEAR SOME ODD CASES THAT HAVE BEEN AT SOME LEVEL OF PART OF ONLY ONE OF WHICH I FELT LIKE WAS NOT A GOOD CANDIDATE- AND HAVING THE SECOND PHYSICIAN THERE WAS KIND OF NECESSARY TO CATCHING THAT SO VERY RARE VERY RARE THAT PATIENTS ARE NOT ELIGIBLE- BUT IT DOES FACILITY THAT CONVERSATION. I AGREE I THINK THAT THE VISIT IS HELPFUL- I DON'T NECESSARILY KNOW WHAT THE RIGHT NUMBER OF DISEASES IN BETWEEN YOU KNOW THE VISITS OR- HAVING THAT TWO SEPARATE WITHOUT FIRST ATTENDING BUT I THINK- I AGREE I THINK IN ALL THE PATIENTS THAT I'VE SEEN- HAD IT HAD THAT HASN'T BEEN THE BARRIER BECAUSE WE CAN DO THOSE VISITS ON THE SAME DAY BACK TO BACK. BILLY THANK OPENING UP TO OF VIDEO VISITS USING TELEMEDICINE FOR RURAL AREAS OR ACCESS ISSUES. IT OPENS MY MIND I THINK AS SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T PRACTICE IN A MAJOR METROPOLITAN AREA. WHERE ACCESS IS A BIGGER ISSUE I THINK THAT IT'S SHORT SIGHTED TO THINK. THAT IF YOU LIVE IN AN AREA WHERE THERE'S JUST ONE PERSON PRESCRIBING ANY DON'T OPEN UP. TO HAVING A SECOND MIND. AT WORK SO. I DON'T I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA YEAH AND IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR SIX THE SAFEGUARD I'VE- RIGHT NOW STAY RAN I THOUGHT TO IS GOOD BUT I THINK THAT IT COULD BE AND SHOULD BE. MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH- TELEMEDICINE AND MAKE JUST MAKING SURE THAT WE SAFEGUARD THAT OPTION SO THAT THE PATIENT RIGHTS IN AREAS THAT ARE NOT. WE FOUND ARE NOT IN THE METROPOLITAN AREAS ARE PROTECTED OTHERWISE IT REALLY IS YOU KNOW. CITY OPTION AND NOT A REAL OPTION AND HOW ABOUT THE THIS THE IDEA OF THE FIRST WE NEED TO BE THE ATTENDING THAT'S COME UP A COUPLE TIMES LIKE IF YOU'RE ATTENDING IS NOT A PARTICIPANT AND WON'T REFER YOU OFF SO SHOULD IT HAVE TO BE AN ATTENDING PHYSICIAN TO YOU. OR YOUR PHYSICIAN IS ABLE TO GET VERY LITERALLY LIKE IT'S CARRIED THEIR PHYSICIAN YEAH SO THAT IS. PROBLEMATIC LANGUAGE IN THE- BILL- BELIEVE IT'S IT DEFINES THE ATTENDING PHYSICIAN AS THE PHYSICIAN THAT HAS THE- THE PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE PATIENTS HEALTH CARE AN UNDERLYING CONDITION. I'M PARAPHRASING BUT THAT'S PRETTY CLOSE TO WHAT THE LAW SAYS. AND THAT THAT'S PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE'S P. C. PEAS OR ONCOLOGISTS OR WHOEVER IT IS THAT'S THEIR PRIMARY PHYSICIAN IS DOING THIS. AND SO THEN IF THEY REFERRED TO ME IN A MEETING FOR THEM FOR THE FIRST TIME. YOU KNOW I'M NOT GONNA TAKE THE EXTRA TIME MAKE THEM WAIT EVEN MORE FOR ME TO ESTABLISH A RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM BEFORE SAYING NOW I'M ACCEPTING YOUR VERBAL REQUEST. SO THAT THAT IS PROBLEMATIC LANGUAGE AND IN THE BILL FROM THAT WAS. WAS PART OF THE NEGOTIATIONS TO GET IT TO GET IT DONE AS A SAFEGUARD YET CENTER WALKING INTO. YEAH I THINK THAT THIS OPPORTUNITY FOR AN ORDER. SO IT THAT'S IN THE IDEAL WORLD THAT'S WHAT IT IS BUT MAYBE THIS IS OPPORTUNITY FOR OR SO IF THE IF THE PATIENT IF THE PHYSICIAN IS NON. UP PARTICIPATING THAT IT COULD BE OR F. IS A PARTICIPATING PHYSICIAN. SO THAT BECAUSE I AS UP SOMEONE WHO. VALUES CONTINUITY OR A PATIENT WHO IS AFRAID THAT THEY'RE GOING TO LOSE. THE CONTINUITY OR PHYSICIAN THAT THEY HAVE. A LOYALTY RELATIONSHIP WITH YOU ACTUALLY DO WANNA PRESERVE BATON AND I'VE HAD PEOPLE THAT HAVE COME TO ME AND THEY THEY'RE WORRIED THAT THEY'RE- FICTIONAL BAND. AND WE TRY AND WE CHAT TRAIN PRESERVE THOSE RELATIONSHIP IMPROPER IMPORTANT RELATIONSHIPS AT THE AND FLY. AND NOT MY TAKE YOUR TIRE RESTED FAMILY IN OF. LIKE DO I HAVE TO LEAVE YOU NOTES. ON PRESS THAT SOME THIS AN ARE YOU NEEDING. TO USE IN ALL. GIVE HER. TO JUST EXT. ROBERT DOCTORS FEEL OF THE THIS. WHAT I PERCEIVE TO BE THIS GO THAT EXISTS. FAMILY PROVIDERS AND THIS THE ONCOLOGISTS THE FOLKS THAT ARE THAT ARE THE GENERAL'S. FIGHTING THAT DISEASE THERE'S JUST IT SEEMS TO ME JUST A TREMENDOUS GULF AND BLESS THE FAMILY PROVIDERS THE FAMILY OF PHYSICIANS AND THE ASSOCIATION FOR. AN WELL BEING CONFRONTED WITH HIS AND DEALING WITH THIS. I WAS INTERESTED WHEN YOU TALKED ABOUT THE FACT YOU'RE TEACHING ROLE- WITH THE RESIDENTS. THERE NEEDS TO BE A LOT MORE I MEAN DO YOU DO THIS BECAUSE YOUR SYSTEM. REQUIRES IT OR DO YOU DO THIS JUST BECAUSE- YOU HAVE EXPERIENCE AND THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT THING FOR THE RESIDENTS TO LEARN. THE LATTER- SO ME AND MY TWO TWO COLLEAGUES THAT I WORK WITH WHO ARE ALSO PARTICIPATING WE ACTUALLY SPENT ABOUT A YEAR YEAR AND A HALF. KINDA LEARNING THIS IN GOING TO PATIENTS AMONG US OUT BEFORE WE EVEN OPENED IT UP TO THE RESIDENCE HE FELT COMFORTABLE- DOING IT THERE IS THE RESIDENTS WERE ASKING FOR IT- SO WE OPENED IT UP TO THAT AND CURRENTLY I'M MORE ACT AS AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL. AMONG PATIENTS TO THE RESIDENCE TEACHING THEM BUT ALSO KIND OF GIVING THEM EXPERIENCE HANDS ON EXPERIENCE WITH PATIENTS THAT THEY FEEL COMFORTABLE WHEN THEY GRADUATE. HELLO PLEASE YES CONTACT FAR I WAS JUST GONNA SAY WE'VE BEEN TEACHING AT THIS. FOR THE TEACHER OF FAIR MEDICINE BECAUSE NEW YORK IS IN US BUT HAS WRAPPED RAMPING UP IN- COLORADO HAS BEEN THE ANYONE WHO'S RECENTLY PASSED HAS RESIDENCY PROGRAMS OF COURSE OREGON HAS BEEN TEACHING IN ITS PROGRAMS AND WASHINGTON. SO WE'VE BEEN BAND TOGETHER TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW CAN WE DO SOMETHING THAT ACTUALLY MEETS THE CRITERIA FOR BEST PRACTICES IN TEACHING SO THAT'S ACTUALLY GOING ON AND BRIAN'S PER MINUTE HE'S WORKED WITH SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE AND IT'S OFFERED. SOME OF THOSE MATERIALS STELLAR. LIKE EVERY ELSE ONE OF THE BACK BACK. TO BE ABLE TO MOVE THIS FAMILY MEDICINE I DON'T THINK THAT IT'S ACCURATE TO SAY THAT ONLY FAMILY PHYSICIANS ARE PRESCRIBING THOUGH AT STANFORD- NEUROLOGISTS ARE PRESCRIBING ONCOLOGISTS ARE PRESCRIBING IT'S VERY INDIVIDUAL HOW PEOPLE SEE IT. WITHIN THEIR PRACTICE IF YOU MOVE FROM HERE TO CARE IF INDIVIDUALS SEE IT AS PART OF THEIR PRACTICE SO I DON'T. AND PALLIATIVE CARE LIKE SOME OF THE PALLIATIVE CARE PEOPLE ARE LEFT DON'T WANT TO DO IT BUT SOME OF EMBRACE DEBT. AS HOW THEY SEE IT AS AS IN THE- INNER FOR TWICE I WOULD BE HESITANT TO. TO CARVE IT OUT I THINK THE REASON FAMILY MEDICINE HAS BEEN- EMBRACING IS BECAUSE IT IS A MOVE IN GENERAL TO MOVE CRUCIAL CONVERSATION. THE TOP TO THAT WOULD HAVE. THIS REFERRALS. PAL CARE IS IN. IN THE- IN THE TWO. FOR HOT TAKE OF PEOPLE IN THE WAY THE THEY MOST DESIRES TO BE MORE PATIENT CENTERED THAT'S I THINK THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING IN PRIMARY CARE IN JAIL. GENERAL INTERNAL MEDICINE TO IS HAVING THE SAME CONVERSATION. THANK YOU. SIDE INTERNET FOR YOU. IN YOUR CONVERSATION YOU MENTIONED THAT MEDICARE DID NOT- COVER THE FINAL VISIT. WHAT IS AN APPROXIMATE COST- TO INDIVIDUALS. AND I KNOW IT CAN BE A BROAD SPECTRUM BUT IT'S A BRAND IT'S A BRAND NEW LOT BY THE WAY THAT'S RESTRICTING IN AGAIN AND YOU'LL HEAR MORE ABOUT THEM THAT THE RESTRICTION ON IT BUT- IT VARIES BECAUSE IT DEPENDS A LOT ON THE ON THE PHYSICIAN BUT WE HAVE THE CALL. THE MEDICATIONS DOWN TO ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS MORE OR LESS ENDED IT GONE UP AT ONE POINT TWO THOUSANDS BY THE MEDICATIONS HAVE SHIFTED AS WE UNDERSTAND OF MORE THE PHYSIOLOGY OF WHAT WORKS BEST FOR- COMING XIN OF THINGS TO HAVE. CONSISTENT SEDATION AND RELIABLE FAST- DEATH. TO BE EXCEPT X. IN THAT IS FEDERAL IN WHEN YOU GO INTO CLINICAL STUFF LIKE HOW IS THAT GOING TO COME. IN THAT'S MY KEEP TALKING NAY YOU'RE TALKING FEDERAL LAW FEDERAL LOCK FEDERAL MEDICARE FEDERAL MEDICARE CORRECT OKAY. SO IN A PROCESS OF THEM I GUESS NOT UNDERSTANDING. THE CONTINUED CARE COST- I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND THE THINKING THAT GOES ALONG WITH THIS WHEN WE TALK ABOUT DIGNITY BUT WE ALSO TALK ABOUT HEALTHCARE COSTS. AND YOU KNOW IT END OF I UNDERSTAND THE MACHINE SOMETIMES. BUT AGAIN I THINK THAT THROUGH OUR ROLE. AB SURF AS TO THE CHAIRS EFFORTS AND WHAT NOT THAT THERE MIGHT. BE A REQUEST THROUGH A RESOLUTION- EGGMAN ALL AGING THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE FASTEST SERVER. NAME PRODUCER- HARMFUL TO- WHAT IT'S TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH IN AND MAY BE PREVENTING- AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE A- IN A WONDERFUL WITH THEIR END OF THEIR LIFE SO I. YOU BRING THAT UP YEAH I THINK IT IS AN IMPORTANT POINT TO NOTE THAT EXPLICITLY BANNING YOUR INSURANCE COMPANY FROM- FROM FROM REIMBURSING FOR THESE SERVICES. PUTS IN EXTRA ONUS ON THE PATIENT AND GOES TOWARDS IT THIS IS THE YOU KNOW HOW PEOPLE WITH HIGHER SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS ARE GONNA BE ABLE TO ACCESS THIS RIGHT MORE. THAN PEOPLE OF LOWER SOCIO ECONOMIC STATUS WE DO A LOT OF SHOWS US TO. HE AND INSIDE IT SAID DONE TO THE BANNING ON TITLE USING TITLE TENNIS TEN FUNDING. IT'S AN AYE DOWN. AND WHEN AND WHEN DID THIS GOING TO AFFECT US JUDGE. I THINK WHAT UP I'LL DEFERRED THE HOSPICE BUT- SO. A NOTE ON. GOVERNOR BROWN DID AUTHORIZE THE USE OF MEDI CAL. PRESUMABLY THAT SOMEBODY WHO HASN'T REACHED THE AGE OF SIXTY FIVE BUT WHO IS SUFFERING FROM A TERMINAL ILLNESS AND THAT IS NOT FEDERAL MEDICAID HOW DOLLARS THOSE ARE OUT OF OUR GENERAL FUND CALIFORNIA DOLLARS TO. RESPECT THAT FEDERAL PROHIBITION ON THAT THAT LEVEL OF ACCESS I THINK IS IMPORTANT TO INCLUDE AS AS WE HAVE THIS CONVERSATION YEAH I WANTED TO JUST POINT OUT THAT WHEN THE LAW PASSED AWAY THIRTY DOING EDUCATE IN THE SAFETY NETS THAT WAS AN INTERESTING THING BECAUSE THE SAFETY NET CLINICS WHICH TAKE MEDICAID- A UNIQUE MEDI CAL WE'RE NOT AWARE OF THAT AND THOUGHT THAT THE BAND WAS THE SAME WOULD BE THE SAME. AND WHEN THEY FOUND THAT WAS NOT THE CASE. THAT THAT WHEN THEY'RE PROVIDERS BECAME INTERESTED IN HOW COULD THEY THEY ARE. OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH FOR YOUR WORK THANK YOU YOU. NEXT IS THE HEALTH SYSTEMS PANEL. I'M GOING TO HEAR FROM A KAISER NORTH AND CITY OF HOPE. DAVID KAT AND DOCTOR CHANDA JUNGLE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WHO WHO HAVE RELATING FIRST AWESOME THANK YOU SO THINK YOU TO YOU CONGRESSMAN EGGMAN AND ALSO ALSO THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS DO YOU GUYS HAVE BOOKED SO DILIGENTLY AT PASSING SOMETHING SO CRUCIAL I'M HOPING TODAY NOT ONLY JUST ECHOING WHAT ALL MY COLLEAGUES HERE HAVE SAID BUT ALSO MAYBE PERHAPS. TRYING TO OFFER SOME SOLUTIONS FROM THE PHYSICIAN WHO ALSO SITS AS AN ADMINISTRATOR AT CITY OF HOPE- IN BRINGING SOME PERSPECTIVES TO LIGHT SO- IT IS A PRIVILEGE FOR ME IN AN HONOR TO BE SITTING THAT EVERYBODY HERE IN THIS ROOM I FEEL I'M IN THE COMPANY OF SAFE FRIENDS ACTUALLY COMPARED TO A LOT OF THE HEALTHCARE WORLD OUT THERE THAT DOES NOT DO THIS OPTION AS A VERY ABOUT THAT OPTION FOR OUR PATIENTS. I'M SUMMIT TRAINED POSITIVE IN HOSPICE POSITION AT CITY OF HOPE I'VE BEEN THERE OVER FOUR YEARS AND ACTUALLY WITH THE LAST FOUR YEARS I'VE HAD MULTIPLE I AM IN MULTIPLE ROLES THERE SO. ONE OF THE RULES THAT I'M VERY. ABOUT THE I ACT IN THE CHAIR OF THE IN OF LIFE OPTION EXCEPT COMMITTEE. AND DOCTOR PATEL WHO JUST LEFT US IS OUT A DEAR FRIEND OF MINE AND WE HAVE A VERY HARD TO GET. THE LOA ACT HERE REALLY VERY PRESENT IN OUR INSTITUTION AND I WOULD LIKE TO SHED SOME LIGHT ON HOW WE ACTUALLY CAME ABOUT. DOING THIS SO AS MOST OF YOU KNOW CITY OF HOPE IS A CANCER CENTER LITTLE LEAGUE EAST OF LOS ANGELES. AND IT IS A CENTER THAT DEALS WITH MOST ADVANCE AND COMPLEX CANCERS IT IS ALSO A TRIAL CENTER. SO IN A SITUATION OR AN INSTITUTION THAT ACTUALLY HAVE SO MANY TRIALS- GOING ON TO ADVANCE. CURED OF CARE FOR CANCER IN OF ITSELF IT'S A CHALLENGE TO PRESENT SOMETHING LIKE THE END OF LIFE OPTION. TO THE POSITIONS THAT ARE PARTICIPATING IN THESE TRIALS BUT I'VE BEEN FORTUNATE TO SAY THAT OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS WE HAVE SEEN SUCH. GROWTH IN TERMS OF THE COMPASSION AND UNDERSTANDING TO ASSIST LAW BECAUSE OF THE WORK YOU'VE DONE. AND I'M HOPING SOME OF THE PROCESSES THAT WE'VE PUT INTO PLACE APTLY CAN BE IMPLEMENTED THOUGHT OTHER INSTITUTIONS THAT MIGHT. MIGHT NEED THE SPORT- WHEN I CAME ON AS- YOU A SUB COMMITTEE CHAIR WHICH SITS ON THE ACTUALLY. THE ETHICS COMMITTEE IT WAS ALREADY A BLESSING- MOST INSTITUTIONS HAVE POSITION. DURING THIS INDIVIDUALLY OR ON THEIR OWN. AT CITY OF HOPE WE ACTUALLY FORMED A STEERING COMMITTEE THAT SETS UNDER THE ETHICS COMMITTEE. JUST PART OF THE MEDICAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE ACCESS WHO YOU LIKE THIS. BOTTOM THE- RESPONSE. I HAVE A ACTUALLY WORKING TO ENSURE. THAT THE STEERING COMMITTEE. APPROVED MEMBERS ON AT THE WILL NOT THOSE BARRIERS TO THIS LAW BUT ACTUALLY ADVANCE THIS LAW. PATIENTS THAT ACTUALLY NEEDED WE- FROM THE ONSET VIEW CREATED. STE EDGE. PROGRAMS OF V. DECIDED TO SURVEY OUR PHYSICIANS TWICE NOT JUST ONCE MANY STATIONS HAVE. NOT YET SURVEYED MOST OF THE POSITIONS BUT SERVING THE PHYSICIANS TO REALLY GET THEIR THOUGHTS ARE THAT POSITION ON THIS ACT. ARE BASED ON THE RESULTS BE GOD AND AS YOU CAN IMAGINE IN THE CANCER CENTER WHERE MOST OF THEM. HAVE DECLINED TO PARTICIPATE. WE ACTUALLY CAME UP WITH A GROUP OF PHYSICIANS THAT ACTUALLY WILL CHAMPION THIS EFFORT AND THESE ARE THE POSITIONS. A HANDFUL OF THAT THAT HAVE BEEN CHAMPIONING THIS THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE INSTITUTION. WE HAVE THE DILIGENTLY TO CREATE EDUCATION PROTOCOLS READ BE TASKED. PHYSICIANS IN THE STEERING COMMITTEE YOU TO GO AND- EDUCATE EACH AND EVERY DEPARTMENT AT. AT CITY OF HOPE ABOUT THE OPTION ACT. UP A LOT OF MISUNDERSTANDINGS WILL CLARIFIED BY DOING THIS AND A LOT OF MORE. POSITIONS WERE OPEN TO REFERRING THAT PATIENTS AND PARTICIPATING IN. THE ACT ITSELF- PART OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE IS ALSO ADDRESSING THE OUT HALF THE SAYS LOOKING AT THE LAW LOOKING AT THE POLICY IS. LOOKING AT WAYS HOW WE CAN ACTUALLY REALLY MAKE IT BETTER NOT ONLY FOR PATIENTS BUT MAYBE WHAT THE INSTITUTIONS- SUCH AS COMPASSION SHORTER THAN UP INSTITUTIONS THAT ACTUALLY. ACTUALLY PROVIDE MOST LAW. UP THE PATIENTS THAT NEED IT. ONE THING I WILL SAY IS. THAT. AS A PHYSICIAN SITTING HERE I AYE OLD LIKE TO THINK THE- HEALTH SYSTEMS CAN EXIST FOR POSITION. AND PART. AND PRACTICES EXIST WITHOUT THE- UP MOST OF PLEASE SO I FEEL THE ROLE OF HEALTH SYSTEMS IS REALLY- TO. OFFER THE BEST PRACTICES THAT BE CAN AS AS HUMANS TO PATIENTS THAT ACTUALLY NEEDED I LOOK AT MADISON. FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE HAVING INTERNET AFTER MY FATHER DIED IS NOT AS AS A PROFESSION BUT AS A- AS A HUMAN ACT THAT. IF WE ARE CAPABLE OF PROVIDING THIS SERVICE OR THIS ASPECT OF THE POSITION WE SHOULD BE PROVIDING THIS TO ALL OF PATIENTS AND ONE THING I'VE REALIZED IS ABOUT A PHYSICIAN IS THAT. THESE PATIENTS THAT THAT OUR TERMINAL THAT ARE. REALLY STRUGGLING EVERY DAY ONCE HEY ALLEGE A BALL AND HOSPICE. TO AVAIL THEMSELVES TO THIS ACT THEY DON'T CHOOSE TO. TO DO THIS JUST OUT OF THE BLUE IF PART ABOUT IT THE PART ABOUT HOW THEY WANT TO DIE THEY DON'T THEY'VE TALKED ABOUT. HOW THEY WANT TO LIVE THE LAST FEW DAYS. I'M AS PHYSICIANS I FEEL LIKE THERE'S STILL A LOT OF CONTROL. IN TERMS OF HOW YOU WANT TO PATIENTS TO DIE I THINK PHYSICIANS HAVE A LOT OF LEARNING TO DO AND GIVING UP. CONTROL PLAGUE. OR SUBJECT THE PATIENTS DO THEIR VIEWS OF INDIGNITY. MAN AT ONE OF THE THINGS I FEEL IS THAT THESE PATIENTS- THEY JUST WANT TO DIE A PIECE THAT AND THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE TRIED TO MAKE POSSIBLE AT CITY OF HOPE. WE B. S. IN THE COMMITTEE WE RECRUIT VERY ACT. PROGRESS BE AND THE WE DO THAT IS EDUCATE AND OUT THE- THAT'S OF HOPE FOR A- IS ACTUALLY VERY. UNIQUE IT'S AN IT'S VERY BUT AT ALSO HAS ROOMS IMPROVE. BEHALF DO. SOCIAL WORKERS THE HAVE BEEN I. JUST TO LEAD THE END OF LIFE OPTION. SO ANYTIME HAVE PATIENTS OR PHYSICIANS ASKING FOR THE END OF LIFE OPTION ACT. THE FIRST- DEAD THE SOCIAL WORKERS GOT TO EDUCATE THESE THESE PATIENTS- AFTER THEY EDUCATE THEM ON THE OFTEN WORK WITH PHYSICIANS TO DETERMINE THE PROGNOSIS. AND THEN WE REFER THEM TO PHYSICIANS THAT ARE PRESCRIBERS. MY DEAL LIKE DOCTOR PATEL SAID THAT THERE'S STILL A DEARTH OF PHYSICIANS THAT ACTUALLY PRESCRIBED THEM THESE OF POSITIONS- THAT ON COLLEGES- EVEN COLLEGES AND OTHER PHYSICIANS AT CITY OF HOPE THAT REALLY ARE NOT COMFORTABLE. IN PRESCRIBING OR PARTICIPATED IN THIS ACT AND SO IT FALLS IN FEW THAT THAT ARE PARTICIPATING TO ACTUALLY DO THE FIRST FOUR OF THOSE AND THE SECOND FOR BILLS RARE. AS WE'VE HEARD THAT REALLY BECOMES AN ISSUE THE WAITING IT IS AN ISSUE BECAUSE OF THAT- ONE OF THE THINGS WE'VE DONE IS ACTUALLY WE'VE CREATED NOW MATERIALS AND MULTIPLE LANGUAGES AND THEY'RE TRYING TO EXPAND THAT FIFTEEN SPANISH BIT ON KOREAN. A BASED ON REALLY CASH AREA THAT SERVES SO THAT THE DOCTOR SPEAK TO THE POPULATION. AND ENVY ARE TRYING TO WORK WITH OUR LEGAL TEAM OF WHICH AS WE KNOW MULTIPLE EAGLE- THE LAW IS INTERPRETED IN MULTIPLE WAYS AND MULTIPLE INSTITUTION. AND WORKING ON THE TEAM ACTUALLY. ASK EARNED AS POSSIBLE SO ONE EXAMPLE. OF USE THAT REPEATED I ASKED LEGAL SUPPORT AND- YOU KNOW THAT THING IN LOS SAYS I AS A- KID BRING UP. LAW DUE TO THE PATIENT. I HAVE REPEATED BEEN TELLING OF THE LAWS VERY CLEAR ABOUT THE- AND SO THIS IS MY NEXT MISSION IN. SHARING THIS OF COULD IS TO TAKE THIS A UP TO. THING IT IS. IT. ACT NOT IN THE LAW AND BE. TO THIS UP AS A HUMAN BECAUSE MEAN IT FOR ME IT CAN DOWN TO. BEING TRANSPARENT BUT I. GIVING THEM ALL AND FOR. AND I THINK THE BIG BARRIER IS THAT IF ARE. INHABITED TALKING TO THEM OF. ALL OF END OF LIFE OPTIONS WE ARE COME. THE WE ARE NOT EVEN TO WHAT'S ON PINNACLE I THINK THERE'S A LOT HEAD AND THERE MY OTHER ROLE ACT. IS BESIDE BEING A PUTZ POSITION AND THE END OF LIFE OUR ACTS ME IS ACT. THE DIRECTOR OF GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION- AT CITY OF HOPE- AND EDUCATION IS EXTREMELY PASSIONATE FOR ME NOT JUST IN. ECOLOGY CATION BUT ALSO END OF LIFE EDUCATION. I DON'T FEEL THAT WE SHOULD LET ANYONE GO THROUGH THE MEDICAL EDUCATION SYSTEM WITHOUT LEARNING AS MUCH ABOUT DEATH AND DYING AS THE- ABOUT. GIVING BIRTH ANTI CARE OF XIN. ARE I I'VE- THAT. IN MY I WROTE A PAPER LAST YEAR THAT THERE'S THAT SAID THAT IF WE TEACH SO MUCH ABOUT GIVING BIRTH. AND WRITING DEATH CERTIFICATES THE FAMOUS SO MUCH OF IT THAT'S IN BETWEEN AND THAT'S WHY I PUT THE MISSION THAT. WE SHOULD NOT BE LETTING ANYONE DIE WITHOUT HAVING EXTENSIVE DEBT CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM I THINK WE HAVE TO NORMALIZE DYING WE HAVE TO NORMALIZE THE FACT THAT. YES BE A 100% EACH ONE OF US GOING TO DIE AND THAT WE NEED TO HAVE CHOICES WE NEED TO KNOW HOW WE WANT TO DIE. WE ALL WILL DIE IT'S I FOR. ONE THAT NOTE SIDE. OF THE PRIVILEGE ONCE THE LUCKY. THEY ACTUALLY A CHOICE THEY WANT TO DIE. THAT'S THE UNFORTUNATE ONES THAT HAVE STRATEGIES BY ACCIDENT THAT SUDDENLY THE LIGHTS A CUT SHORT THAT. DON'T EVEN GET THE OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY DECIDE THEMSELVES A HOT CONVERSATIONS. HELLO YEAR I'M I CREATED THE AND THE FLY. SOME AT CITY HOPE. I THINK CANCER CENTER THAT ACTUALLY DOES NOT TALK ABOUT DEATH AND DYING. IT WAS THE FOR. ONE EVER IT'S OF HOPE IN ITS HISTORY. OF AND WHICH HOW OF. GETTING GETTING HELP FROM CNC. TO PUTTING TOGETHER AND END OF LIFE OPTION ACT PANEL BUT ALSO NOT JUST STOP TALKING ABOUT. EVERY ASPECT OF IN THE FLY FROM SEVEN THIRTY IN THE MORNING TO SIX THIRTY IN THE EVENING. I WILL BE PROUD TO SAY THAT AT THE END OF THE DAY IT OF A MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE STILL SITTING THERE. AND PARTICIPATING IN THE SYMPOSIUM TO THE FACT THAT THERE WAS THAT THE INSTITUTION HAS RECOGNIZED ITS- ITS EXCELLENCE AND HAS INDICTED NOW FOR FIVE YEARS. SO WE WILL CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION ON MULTIPLE BILLS. AT IT IS OPEN EVERYONE ACROSS THE NATION TO ATTEND- ONE OF THE THINGS I FEEL VERY STRONGLY AS A PHYSICIAN IS THAT THAT THIS NOT ONLY NEEDS TO BE DONE AT THE RESIDENT. AND FELLOWS LEVEL AS I WILL BE IMPLEMENTING IN MY OWN INSTITUTION. BUT IT NEEDS TO BE TAUGHT AT THE LEVEL OF MEDICAL STEEP. THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT FEAR TRAINING. TO WORK HUMANS. AND THAT AND THERE'S REASON THAT I'M- STE. SHOULD NOT STOCK THE STE FROM EARLY ON. THERE IS A DOES HAVING THROUGH MANY SCHOOL A DOES OF. REALLY CA. THAT ACTUALLY EVEN. COVERS POSITIVE OR END OF LIFE ISSUES I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING MEDICAL SCHOOLS AND THE SOCIETY SHOULD. STRONGLY LOOK AT. THE OTHER THING I WILL SAY IS THAT I KNOW LAST YEAR THE MEDICAL- BOARD ACTUALLY IN CALIFORNIA. SAID THAT ANY PHYSICIAN WHO HAD A LICENSE UP TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN. SHOULD BE LOOKING TO GET AT LEAST TWELVE- CREDITS OF CONTINUING EDUCATION AND DEFLECTED GOV END OF LIFE PATIENTS END OF LIFE CARE ALSO IN TERMS OF OPIOIDS- I FEEL LIKE WITH OUR SYMPOSIUM AND MY TRAINING FOR. GUIDANCE FOR OUR FELLOWS AND RESIDENTS WE ARE MEETING THAT. BUT I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE MANDATED AT ALL- ALL INSTITUTIONS- TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR- THEIR PHYSICIANS ACTUALLY HAVE THAT END OF LIFE CARE TRAINING. I'M I FEEL AND PHYSICIANS BE OFTEN GET SO BUSY AND WRAPPED UP NOT ONLY VERY PRACTICES THAT BEHALF BUT OUR OWN PERSONAL FAMILY LIVES AND REALLY. THAT THE DUTIES WE HAVE BESIDES BEING POSITIONS. I THINK SOME OF THESE THINGS IF THEY'RE NOT REALLY. MAN BY BY IT REALLY LAW EVEN IS TO YOU. THEY WILL NEVER BE LOOKED AT AND EVEN REMAIN SUBLET. ONLY TO THE PINNACLE THE ICE RUBIO I FEEL THAT. WE AS AS A SOCIETY IN TERMS OF THE THERE ARE MULTIPLE BARRIERS THAT BEGIN BEGIN- OVERCOME. I THINK PROVIDE A PARTICIPATION IS A BIG ISSUED MEANT INSTITUTION AND THAT'S A BIG ISSUE ELSEWHERE I THINK EDUCATION EDUCATION EDUCATION AND COMPASSIONATE EDUCATION IS THE KEY TO THAT- I HAVE OFTEN SAID THAT THAT THAT THEIR SYMPOSIUM I AM HAPPY TO PARTNER BUT- THE GOVERNMENT'S THE STATE. WITH THE REALLY ANYONE TO REALLY TAKE THIS TO RURAL AREAS BECAUSE I DO SEE PATIENTS THAT COME FROM FAR AWAY THAT THAT DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION. AND PROVIDERS DON'T HAVE THAT ACCESS THE PATIENTS WILL NEVER HAVE THAT ACCESS OR OR INFORMATION- WE BELIEVE THAT YOU KNOW OUR INSTITUTION AS BEHIND IN TELEHEALTH EXPLORING ABOUT OPTIONS AND THAT IS SOMETHING BE OF BE LOOKING TO PUSH IN OUR INSTITUTION AS WELL. THE OTHER THING IS THERE HAS TO BE- REALLY CULTURAL CHANGE WITH EVERY INSTITUTION FACING THAT YOU KNOW WHEN YOU ARE FACED WITH COMES BUT WITH PATIENTS THAT HAVE PRO PROGNOSES AND THAT A HOSPICE ELIGIBLE WHICH IS ONE OF THE CRITERIA IS. UP YOU HAVE TO START THIS CONVERSATION AT THAT POINT AND NOT WHEN THEY HAVE. A FEW DAYS LEFT BECAUSE MOST OF THEM AS WE SEE DO NOT EVEN GO THROUGH THE PROCESS I CANNOT MAKE IT TO THE PROCESS. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT ALSO NEEDS HAPPEN IS THE- I THINK A V. ALL AS A AS A TEAM. AS A TEAM IN THE TO DECIDE THAT YOU KNOW THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT JUST POSITION SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO PRACTICE. THERE IS YET ANOTHER SET OF VISIT OF A PROVIDERS NURSE PRACTITIONERS PA'S THAT ARE AS AS EDUCATED AND ASK CAPABLE OF DOING THIS SO BY ADDING THOSE PEOPLE TO PARTICIPATE IN BEING PROVIDERS AND PRESCRIBERS. WE WILL ACTUALLY EXPAND THE SCOPE IN THE HORIZON OF THIS LAW- THERE'S A LOT THAT THIS LAW HAS BROUGHT THERE'S A LOT THAT YOU CAN CHANGE TOGETHER AND MY PLEASE THAT HOPEFULLY VEAS PROVIDERS INSTITUTIONS CAN WORK WITH YOU. TO MAKE IT HAPPEN. AND WIESE WELCOME YOUR IDEAS ABOUT EXPANDING THIS AND HOPE THAT YOU CONTINUE TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION WITH IN YOUR PROFESSION. HAS THAT'S MOST MOSTLY THE BIGGEST STICKING POINT IN BEING ABLE TO EXPAND I. AM FURTHER. AND I JUST WANNA SAY AS COMMITTEES HAPPEN PEOPLE HAVE TO STEP OFF AND IT DIDN'T IT'S NOTHING ABOUT WHO'S BEING PRESENT AND I WILL BE HERE AT THE ENTIRE TIME BUT OTHER PEOPLE HAVE WE'LL HAVE TO. WE'LL HAVE TO LEAVE THEM THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR WHAT YOU'RE PROVIDING I THINK IT'S A ESSENTIAL AND AN EXCITING TO SEE SOMEBODY- WITH AS MUCH ENTHUSIASM AND- AND THE TIME AND THE VISION I THINK TO CARRY THIS FORWARD. I DID MY- MY DISSERTATION MISTING IS TWO THOUSAND AND ONE SO ALMOST. TWENTY YEARS AGO ON END OF LIFE AND THE MEXICAN AMERICAN CULTURE ESSAY INTERCEPTED END OF LIFE AND ONE OF THE BIG TAKEAWAYS WAS MORE PHYSICIAN EDUCATION AROUND AND LIFE SINCE THAT WAS TWENTY YEARS AGO WE'RE STILL HAVE THAT SAME CONVERSATION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR MORNING MY NAME IS DAVID CONAN TIME AN INTERNIST SERVING AS REGIONAL CO MEDICAL DIRECTOR OF THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA KAISER PERMANENTE A END OF LIFE OPTION PROGRAM. AND ON BEHALF OF OUR LEADERSHIP TEAM I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE OUR EXPERIENCE IMPLEMENTING THE END OF LIFE OPTION ACT. AND SERVING PATIENTS REQUEST MEDICAL AID IN DYING. IN TWENTY FIFTEEN WE THE END OF LIFE UP ACT WAS AN- BECAUSE PERMANENTE RECOGNIZE THAT SOME OVER EIGHT MILLION. CALIFORNIA MEMBERS OF WANT TO AVAIL THEMSELVES OF THIS OPTION AND WOULD REQUEST MEDICAL AID IN DYING FROM US. AND OUR MISSION OF PROVIDING COMPREHENSIVE CARE TO OUR MEMBERS LED US TO DECIDE TO OPT IN AS A HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. ONCE THAT DECISION WAS MADE OUR GUIDING PRINCIPLES FOR OUR PROGRAM BECAME CLEAR. FIRST IN NO PATIENT WOULD CHOOSE MEDICAL AID IN DYING DUE TO AN INABILITY TO ACCESS HIGH QUALITY HOSPICE AND PALLIATIVE CARE SERVICE. SECOND WE WOULD HONOR OUR PHYSICIANS AND STAFF CHOICES TO PARTICIPATE OR NOT. AS AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM WITH A LARGE MEDICAL GROUP WE KNEW THAT WE COULD DEVELOP A STRONG PROGRAM BECAUSE WE HAVE ENOUGH PHYSICIANS AND STAFF TO ALLOW CHOICE AND PARTICIPATION. AND WE HAVEN'T THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR SMOOTH AND SUCCESSFUL OPERATIONS. WE ARE PROUD TO REPORT THAT 99% OF OUR PATIENTS WHO QUALIFY TO HAVE A PRESCRIPTION WRITTEN UNDER THE LAW OUR ON HOSPICE HAVE HAD A PALLIATIVE CARE CONSULTATION OR BOTH. AND THAT WE HAVE HAD ENOUGH PROVIDERS OPTING IN TO ALLOW THOSE WHO OPT OUT TO FEEL COMFORTABLE AND SUPPORTED. WE CONTINUE TO ALLOW FOR THE PROSPECT THAT PHYSICIANS VIEWS CAN CHANGE OVER TIME. AND THUS WE HAVE NOT IMPLEMENTED A ONE TIME DECLARATION TO OPT IN OR OUT. INSTEAD OF OUR PATIENT COORDINATORS INVITE PHYSICIANS TO PARTICIPATE PATIENTS BASED ON PATIENT PREFERENCES. AND PROVIDE AN ALTERNATE- PHYSICIAN FOR THOSE WHO OPT OUT. PHYSICIANS CAN MAKE THEIR OWN PERSONAL DETERMINATION WITHOUT WORRYING THAT THE PATIENT'S NEEDS WON'T BE MATT. OF NOTE ROUGHLY TWO THIRDS OF OUR PHYSICIANS WHO REFER PATIENTS TO THE PROGRAM ARE WILLING TO PARTICIPATE IN SOME FASHION. TODAY I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE SOME OF OUR PROGRAMS ELEMENTS THAT HAVE LED LED TO ITS SUCCESS AS WELL AS FEEDBACK WE RECEIVE FROM PATIENTS AND PHYSICIANS ABOUT THE EXPERIENCE OF PARTICIPATING. I WILL ALSO LIKE TO SHARE SOME IDEAS UP ABOUT OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVEMENT. FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE COMMITTEE. ONE OF THE KEYS TO THE SUCCESS OF OUR PROGRAM HAS BEEN THE PATIENT COORDINATOR POSITION. OUR RECORDING NADER'S WORSE AN ABSOLUTELY SPECTACULAR GROUP OF WOMEN OUT TALK TO EACH REFERRED PATIENT. PROVIDING AN OVERVIEW OF THE LAW AND THE PROCESS BY PHONE. IF THE PATIENT IS INTERESTED IN PROCEEDING THE COORDINATOR IDENTIFIES THE PARTICIPATING PHYSICIANS SCHEDULES THE APPOINTMENTS INITIATES THE PAPERWORK AND SCHEDULES THE MEDICATION DELIVERY. THE COORDINATORS THERE FOR EVERY STEP OF THE PROCESS ENSURING IT GOES SMOOTHLY AND PROVIDING A CENTRAL CONTACT FOR PATIENTS AND FAMILIES. AS WELL AS PHYSICIANS. ALSO QUESTIONS GET ANSWERED AND NOTHING FALLS THROUGH THE CRACKS. BEYOND ASSISTING THE PATIENT THE COORDINATOR WORKS WITH THE PHYSICIAN TO REVIEW THE REQUIRED STEPS ENSURE THAT DOCUMENTATION IS COMPLETED AND CONNECT FIRST TIME PHYSICIANS WITH A MENTOR TO PROVIDE COACHING AND REASSURANCE. THE COORDINATORS ARE AN ESSENTIAL RESOURCE AND PROGRAM WE'RE NOT BE SUCCESSFUL WITHOUT THEM. A SECOND KEY OF OUR PROGRAM HAS BEEN THE EXTENSIVE TRAINING THAT WE HAVE DEVELOPED ACROSS THE ORGANIZATION TO HELP PREPARE PHYSICIANS AND STAFF. THIS HAS INCLUDED COMMUNICATION TRAININGS FOR PHYSICIANS PHARMACISTS AND PATIENT COORDINATORS THAT FOCUS ON HOW TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH PATIENTS ABOUT THIS OPTION. WE'VE ALSO DONE TO REGION WIDE ON VIDEO CONFERENCES NUMEROUS SPECIALTY DEPARTMENT MEETINGS GROUND ROUNDS AND SCHWARTZ CENTER ROOMS. EDUCATION HAS BEEN KEY IN ENSURING PARTICIPATING PHYSICIANS AND STAFF PROVIDE A HIGH LEVEL OF SERVICE TO OUR PATIENTS AND TO ALLOW TIME TO REFLECT ON THE LAW TO HELP INDIVIDUALS DETERMINE WHETHER TO PARTICIPATE AND HOW TO REFER. TO MAINTAIN THE PATIENT PERSPECTIVE IN OUR WORK WE REGULARLY INCLUDE PATIENT AND FAMILY FEEDBACK PRESENTATIONS AS PART OF EDUCATION JUST LIKE YOU'RE DOING TODAY. MY THIRD IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF OUR PROGRAM IS RELATED TO OUR PHARMACISTS. WE HAVE TO DISPENSING PHARMACIES IN OUR REGION AND MORE THAN THIRTY TRAINED PHARMACISTS THAT GO TO THE HOME TO DELIVER THE MEDICATION AND PROVIDE CONSULTATION TO THE PATIENT AND FAMILY ON HOW TO PREPARE. STORE AND SAFELY DISPOSE OF THE MEDICATION IF IT'S NOT INTERESTED. A FOURTH AREA I WOULD LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT AS OUR EFFORTS TO PARTNER WITH OUR PATIENTS HOSPICE AGENCIES TO ENSURE THAT PATIENTS HAVE SUPPORT FROM HOSPICE SHOULD THEY CHOOSE TO INGEST. HOSPICE HAS GREAT EXPERTISE TO PROVIDE INCLUDING HELPING PATIENTS DETERMINE TIMING OF MEDICATION INGESTION. EMOTIONAL AND SPIRITUAL SUPPORT FOR THE PATIENT AND FAMILY AND BEREAVEMENT SERVICES. A FINAL KEY TO THE SUCCESS OF OUR PROGRAM IS RELATED TO INFRASTRUCTURE AND LEADERSHIP. ACCESSING IN QUALIFYING PATIENTS FOR MEDICAL AID IN DYING REQUIRES A PROCESS AND WORK FLOWS WE HAVE CREATED CLINICAL WORK FLOWS THAT ARE EMBEDDED IN OUR INFRASTRUCTURE. REFERRALS CAN BE PLACED IN OUR ELECTRONIC REFERRAL SYSTEM AND DOCUMENTATION TOOLS EXIST IN OUR ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD FOR VISITS AND MEDICATION ORDERING. IN ADDITION WE HAVE A PHYSICIAN AND ADMINISTRATIVE LEAD IN EACH SERVICE AREA TO PROVIDE SUPPORT ON CAISSONS AND STREAMLINE OPERATIONS TO HELP FACILITATE TIMELY PROCESS AND COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW. I WOULD LIKE TO SHIFT GEARS NOW TO REVIEW SOME OF THE FEEDBACK THAT WE HAVE HEARD FROM PARTICIPATING PATIENTS AND FAMILIES. WE CONSISTENTLY HEAR FROM PATIENTS AND FAMILIES HOW GRATEFUL THEY ARE TO HAVE THIS OPTION REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT PATIENTS END UP TAKING THE EIGHT AND ON MEDICATION. THEIR FEEDBACK UNDERSCORES THAT THE LAW HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL. IN GETTING MANY DYING PATIENTS. THEIR THEIR WISH TO HAVE SOME MEASURE OF CONTROL OVER THE END OF THEIR LIFE. OUR PARTICIPATING PHYSICIANS OF REPORTED A GREAT SENSE OF MEANING IN THEIR WORK. AND THOSE THAT DON'T PARTICIPATE ARE APPRECIATIVE THAT THEY HAVE COLLEAGUES WHO WILL ACCEPT REFERRALS. BASED ON FEEDBACK WE'VE RECEIVED IN OUR EXPERIENCE TO DATE I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT FOR AREAS WHERE THERE MAY BE SOME OPPORTUNITIES FOR CONSIDERATION. THE FIRST CHALLENGING AREA IS RELATED TO ELIGIBILITY. THE CURRENT ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS CREATE LIMITATIONS FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH NARROW GENERATIVE DISEASES LIKE A ALAS. FINDING OPTIMAL TIMING IN A SETTING OF DECLINING MOTOR FUNCTION WHILE STAYING TRUE TO THE REQUIREMENT OF SELF ADMINISTRATION IS CHALLENGING FOR THIS POPULATION OF PATIENTS. IN ADDITION WHILE CAUTION IS CERTAINLY WARRANTED FOR PEOPLE SUFFERING FROM DEMENTIA THE LACK OF ABILITY OF INDIVIDUALS WITH DEMENTIA TO EXERCISE THIS OPTION IS AN AREA. OF FRUSTRATION THAT WE HAVE HEARD IN ABUNDANCE AND IS LIKELY INCREASE OVER TIME GIVING OUR AGING POPULATION. SECONDLY WE BELIEVE THAT THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW THAT FIFTEEN DAY WAITING HER HEAD FROM A LEGAL AND LOGISTICAL PERSPECTIVE AS YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT MULTIPLE- OCCASIONS THIS MORNING OFTEN PATIENTS THINK THE FIFTEEN DAY WAITING PERIOD STARTS WHEN THEY FIRST ASKED ABOUT THE OPTION BUT THAT. IS NOT USUALLY THE CASE BECAUSE THE FIFTEEN DAY CLOCK DOESN'T START UNTIL THEY ARE MEETING WITH THE ATTENDING PHYSICIAN. IT CAN TAKE TIME TO CONNECT THEM WITH THAT DOCTOR. THIS CREATES STRESS AND ANXIETY FOR THE PATIENT. ESPECIALLY IF THEIR HEALTH IS IN DECLINE. OUR PATIENT COORDINATORS TELL PATIENTS IT WILL TYPICALLY TAKE THREE TO FOUR WEEKS TO GET THROUGH THE PROCESS BASED ON THE TIME IT TAKES TO IDENTIFY PHYSICIANS GET APPOINTMENTS COMPLETE DOCUMENTATION AND COORDINATE DELIVERY OF THE PRESCRIPTION. AND AS WE'VE SPOKEN ABOUT OREGON NOW ALLOWS THE ATTENDING PHYSICIAN TO WAIVE THE WAITING PERIOD IF WARRANTED. A THIRD PRACTICAL CONSIDERATION IS REGARDING DATA REPORTING WHICH WE HAVE FOUND TO BE UNNECESSARILY CUMBERSOME. INITIALLY FORMS WERE COMPLETED BY HAND AND SUBMITTED BY FAX OR MAIL CITY PH HAS CREATED AN ONLINE REPORTING SYSTEM AS YOU HEARD ABOUT JOHN IT ACTUALLY HAS MANY KINKS THAT DO NOT MAKE IT A PARTICULARLY VIABLE ALTERNATIVE. AND WE WOULD RECOMMEND ENHANCEMENTS IN THE ELECTRONIC REPORTING SYSTEM TO MAKE IT EASIER TO ENTER DATA SIGN FORMS ELECTRONICALLY AND RECEIVE SIGNED COPIES BUT FOR MEDICAL RECORDS. LASTLY WOULD LIKE TO CALL YOUR ATTENTION TO THE MEDICATION. THERE HAVE BEEN CHALLENGES WITH MEDICATION SUPPLY. AS YOU KNOW- SEEK A BARBER TELL IS NOT CURRENTLY ON THE MARKET AND ALTERNATIVES ARE ARE BEING USED. THE COST AT THE END OF LIFE MEDICATIONS AS OF STILL QUITE HIGH RAISING THE QUESTION OF. WHETHER IT IS READILY AVAILABLE TO PATIENTS OF ALL SOCIAL ECONOMIC STATUS. WE DO PROVIDE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE IN SOME CASES TO ALLOW MEMBERS TO FOR THE MEDICATION. DESPITE THESE CHALLENGES KAISER PERMANENTE HAS BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE EXCELLENT MEDICAL AID IN DYING SERVICES TO OUR PATIENTS. IMPLEMENTING A PROGRAM TO PROVIDE THIS SERVICE IN A LARGE HEALTH SYSTEM HAS REQUIRE THOUGHTFUL PROGRAM PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION AS WELL AS RESOURCES. WE ARE PROUD OF THE PROGRAM WE HAVE DEVELOPED AND HAPPY TO SHARE OUR LEARNINGS WITH OTHER HEALTH SYSTEMS WHO ARE LOOKING TO ENHANCE OUR START THEIR OWN PROGRAMS. REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE OUR EXPERIENCE WITH. I WANT TO THANK YOU BOTH IN THE ABSENCE OF OUR CHAIR HOMEY RETURNING MOMENTARILY. THE PROGRAM AT CITY OF HOPE FROM HAVING AS THE DESIGNATED COMMITTEE JUST SEEMS LIKE YEAR SETTING AGREE STANDARD IN. AIRED TO SHAREIT IN KAISER I HAD A QUESTION DOCTOR COMMENT ON THAT PATIENT COORDINATORS. WHO COORDINATE WITH PATIENT APPOINTMENTS MEDICATIONS COORDINATE WITH THE PHYSICIAN AT WHAT POINT DOES THAT PATIENT COORDINATOR GET INVOLVED IS THAT BASED ON A PHYSICIAN'S. CONSULTATION WITH THE PATIENT THAT THEY WANT TO PURSUE THIS THEN THE ENGAGE THE PATIENT COORDINATOR THERE ARE ACTUALLY A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT PORTALS UHHUH SO WE DO HAVE- IN OUR- ELECTRONIC REFERRAL SYSTEM WE HAVE A PORTAL WHERE A PHYSICIAN WHO HEARS FROM A PATIENT THAT THEY'D LIKE TO. EITHER LEARN ABOUT THE PROGRAM OR FOR A QUITE SURE THAT THEY WANT TO PARTICIPATE- THE PHYSICIAN CAN SEND A REFERRAL. AND THAT WILL RESULT IN A AN INITIAL PHONE CONTACT WITH A PATIENT COORDINATOR GENERALLY WITHIN A DAY OR TWO. OUR OUR OUR REGIONAL CALL CENTER IS ACTUALLY ALSO EMPOWERED TO- TO LINK PATIENTS TO THE PROGRAM AS WELL IF A PATIENT CALLS UP THE CALL CENTER. EXPRESSING AN INTEREST IN THE PROGRAM. THANK YOU. LET ME JUST SEE IF THEY HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. TURNING BACK TO MADAM CHAIR DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR NO I DON'T THINK SO I THINK EVEN THE VERY CLEAR- I GUESS MY ONE QUESTION ALTHOUGH I THINK MY ANSWER IT IN MY HEAD IS LIKE IT'S LIKE THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE WERE WERE IN UNDER ONE DOWN BUT WE'RE TWO DIFFERENT AGENCIES. BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN SOME DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE WITH KAISER SOUTH AND THERE HAS BEEN WITH KAISER NORTH- AND IS THERE ARE YOU WORKING ON A BRIDGE FOR THE DOME. SO THERE ARE ARE SOME ELEMENTS OF OUR LEADERSHIP STRUCTURES THAT ARE IN COMMON AND SOME THAT ARE A BIT SEPARATE- SO I THINK WE'RE MAKING ATTITUDE TO COORDINATE MORE REGULARLY WITH OUR COUNTERPARTS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND TO AND TO REALLY LEARN FROM ONE ANOTHER SENATE. MODEL YEAH. UP OKAY ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH A TWO THE TIME THANK UP HERE HAVE A KAISER ON THE HUGE YOU DO AND FOR THE CITY OF HOPE WHAT A WHAT A UNIQUE PLACE TO REALLY DELVE INTO THIS PRACTICE THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING YOU ALL HAVE DONE ABSOLUTELY I WANT TO COME TO I WANT TO COME TO YOUR YOUR- YOUR STARTING NEXT YEAR.

THE NEXT UP W HAVE THE HOSPICE PANEL- ADD. FROM SEASONS AUSPICE MISSION HOSPICE IN OLYMPIA HOSPICE CARE. WELCOME. AND I AM ENGAGE IN ANOTHER ENDEAVOR RIGHT NOW IN MY LIFE FORM SPENDING A LOT OF TIME KNOCKING ON DOORS IN HOMES AROUND THE TOOK THREE COUNTIES AND- I FEEL LIKE A HOSPICE WORKER AGAIN HALF THE TIME I WALKING UP TO THE DOOR OF DOING A QUICK ASSESSMENT I'M LOOKING AT WHEELCHAIR ACCESS YEAH ANYWAY WE WILL ALWAYS BE A GOOD. REGULAR THE COMPACT OKAY. OKAY KNOW HOW WOULD LIKE TO SEE IF HELLO MY NAME IS ANNA SAFARI IN AND I AM THE OWNER OF OLYMPIA HOSPICE CARE LOCATED IN SHERMAN OAKS CALIFORNIA FIRST AND FOREMOST I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THANK YOU FOR CONVENING THIS FORM. AND ALONG WITH A SPEAK ABOUT MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH MEDICAL AID IN DYING AND THE END OF LIFE OPTION ACT WORKING IN THE HOSPITAL THREE FOR THE PAST TEN YEARS. I KNEW WHEN THE BILL WAS FIRST PASSED IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THAT WE WOULD NEED TO MAKE A DECISION AS A TEAM WHETHER WE WOULD BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE PROGRAM CAN YOU MOVE THE MIKE A LITTLE BIT CLOSER MAYBE. SURE OKAY THING ON. ACCOUNT JUST CONTINUE. YEAH SO I KNEW WHEN THE BILL WAS PASSED BACK IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THAT WE WOULD NEED TO MAKE A DECISION IF WE WERE GOING ON BREAKS THE LAW. OR NOT. SO WHEN WE MET FIRST WITH THE TEAM TO DISCUSS- IT WAS A VERY DIFFICULT SUBJECT TO TALK ABOUT. AND WE KIND OF LEFT IT AS IT IS AND WE SAID WE WILL TALK ABOUT IT AT A LATER TIME. A FEW WEEKS LATER I GOT OUT TO SEE A POTENTIAL PATIENT IN A HOSPITAL TO DO A EXPLANATION OF BENEFITS. SHE TOTALLY TOOK ME BY SURPRISE. LITTLE LADY IN A BED CANCER PATIENT AS SHE LOOKED AT ME AND SHE SAID YOU KNOW SHE SHE ASKED MY HOUSE WAS COMPANY AND MY NAME MEANT WHAT MY POSITION IS AND SHE SAID. DO YOU OFFER THE AND THE LIFE OPTION ACT I IMMEDIATELY SAID NO. AND SHE LOOKED AT MICHIGAN'S WILL IF YOU WERE IN MY SHOES YOU WOULD. AND THAT TO ME WAS LIKE THE LIGHTS GOING OFF AM I THOUGHT OF HER I'D- STILL CONVERSION HER IN THE BED MMHM THOUGHT OF HER PAIN HER. FRUSTRATION FOR ME TO SAY NO AND OBVIOUSLY SHE DID NOT SIGN UP WITH US. I LEFT BACK TO THE OFFICE- THOUGHT ABOUT IT FOR A FEW DAYS. US OUR IT TEAM TO SIT DOWN SO WE CAN DISCUSS THIS ALL OVER AGAIN. AT THAT POINT WE SAID LET'S BRING IN COMPASSIONATE CHOICES BECAUSE THEY WERE THE ONES THAT KIND OF INTRODUCED US TO. MEDICAL AID IN DYING AND IF WE WOULD BE A PART OF THE- OCT WE BROUGHT THEM IN AND DAY TAUGHT AND EDUCATED AND SHOWED US SO MUCH. AND KINDA LIKE HELD OUR HAND. I THANK HIM AND KAREN MARIN GREEN SHE WAS EXCELLENT AND SAID. SO THEY KINDA LIKE HELPED US UNDERSTAND THE ACT AND FROM THAT POINT ON WE WROTE OUR POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AS A TEAM. ACCORDANCE BY THE LAW AND WE SAID WE ARE GOING TO BE EMBRACING THE LAW. AND I WANT TO SAY FROM MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE. IT HAS BEEN TRANSFORMATIONAL FOR ME AS A PERSON AS A TEAM AS A COMPANY I THINK EMPATHY IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART IN THIS WHOLE THING. IF WE- USE EMPATHY WE WILL UNDERSTAND WHAT PEOPLE FEEL WHAT FAMILIES GO THROUGH AND WE CAN. EMBRACE IT IN A DIFFERENT WAY AND NOT JUDGE PEOPLE FOR WHAT THEY CHOOSE BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE WHOLE STIGMA TO THEM AS A PROP MEDICAL AID IN DYING. SO I TOOK PRIDE IN MY JOURNEY I COMMEND MY TEENS OPENNESS TO THIS CHANGE AND THEIR DEDICATION TO ADVOCATING FOR OUR PATIENTS AS A MATTER OF FACT MY SON. ALSO HAS THE HOSPICE COMPANY IN THE ORANGE COUNTY AREA AND WHEN I BROUGHT THIS UP TO HIM ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO HE SAID YOU KNOW MOM I DON'T THINK I CAN DO THAT. I SAID YOU KNOW WHAT. MY RECOMMENDATION TO YOU IS YOU HAVE TO BE OPEN AND YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE GO THROUGH. YOU HAVE TO EMBRACE. THE FAMILY'S CHOICE THE PATIENT CHOICE BOTTOM LINE IS PATIENT CHOICE. AND I COULD SAY HE DID. AND HE CURRENTLY HAS THREE PATIENTS THAT ARE DOING THE MEDICAL AID IN DYING. CURRENTLY SO I JUST WANT TO GIVE A BRIEF- SIX MONTH ANALYSIS ABOUT OUR COMPANY SO THE LAST SIX MONTHS WE HAVE HAD FOURTEEN PATIENTS SIGN ON TO HOSPICE CARE FOR MEDICAL AID IN DYING AND THEY COME ON SPECIFICALLY FOR THAT YES THEY CAME ON SPECIFICALLY FOR MEDICAL AID IN DYING FOR A WHICH CAME FROM DIFFERENT HOSPICE AGENCIES THAT DID NOT SUPPORT THE ACT OR COULD NOT. MEET THEIR NEEDS. I DON'T THE FOURTEEN TEN HAVE LREADY TAKEN THE MEDICATION AND HAVE DIED PEACEFULLY. AND WITH DIGNITY. AS A MATTER OF FACT ONE OF THE PATIENTS THAT DID PASS AWAY WROTE US A YELP REVIEW TWO DAYS BEFORE HE PASSED AWAY. I'M NOT KIDDING YOU DON'T KNOW YOUR- HE WAS BORN ON FEBRUARY ONE AND HE ABOUT THE YELP REVIEW AND YOU PUT. TWO ONE FORTY THREE TO TWO ONE TWENTY TWENTY. AND I BROUGHT UP THE FACT AND I SAID WHAT IF YOU TAKE THE MEDICATION AND DON'T DON'T DON'T DIE ON THE FIRST HE SAID WELL IT IS WHAT IT IS I TOOK IT ON THAT DATE. SO AND TWO OF THE PATIENTS ARE CURRENTLY ON OUR SERVICE WAITING FOR WE'RE JUST WAITING FOR THEM TO LET US KNOW WHEN THEY WANT TO TAKE IT AND TWO OF THEM DIED BEFORE TAKING THE MEDICATION SOLD TEN OUT OF THE FOURTEEN HAVE ALREADY PASSED. BUT THE COMFORT OF HAVING THE PRESCRIPTION DEFINITELY- OH YES YES. SO SENS OFFERING THE SERVICE I HAVE BEEN ASKED BY TWO FAMILY MEMBERS ALREADY TO WITNESS AND BE THERE AND BELIEVE ME. I CANNOT FORGET THAT SITE EVER IN MY LIFE IT'S A VERY. I THOUGHT GOING AND I WOULD BE SAD AND I WOULD BE BUT IT'S JUST SO BEAUTIFUL AND YOU SEE YOU KNOW EVERYBODY COMES TOGETHER THEY SAY GOODBYES AND- THE PATIENT IS. HAPPY DAY THEY KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE DOING THEY'LL TAKE A POPSICLE OR THEY'LL TAKE A CHASER BEFORE THEY DO THE CONCOCTION. AND THEY'RE JUST HAPPY DEL GOING TO BED YOU KNOW ONE OF THEM I WITNESSED THE WIFE WENT INTO BED WITH THEM WITH THEIR DOG AND JUST WAITED. UNTIL HE PASSED WHICH I THINK WAS JUST BEAUTIFUL. ANOTHER NOTE- OUR YOUNGEST PATIENT THAT TOOK THE MEDICATION ABOUT THREE WEEKS AGO WAS JUST TWENTY NINE YEARS OLD. HE HAD STOMACH CANCER WAS REFERRED TO US FROM CITY OF HOPE THANK YOU DOCTOR BANERJEE FROM HERE. AND HE TOOK THE MEDICATION TWENTY NINE YEAR OLD AND HE PASSED AWAY THE CAN OF IN A- COMFORT. SO OUR TEAM AT OLYMPIA HOSPICE CARE HAS ALWAYS BELIEVED IN EDUCATING PEOPLE AND GIVING THEM THE INFORMATION AND SUPPORT TO MAKE DECISIONS. SO WE'VE BEEN DEDICATING A LOT OF OUR TIME TO EDUCATE DOCTORS OFFICES- UNLIKE DOCTOR BANERJEE DID SAID OUR MEDICAL DIRECTOR WAS AT THE CONFERENCE ROOM AT CITY OF HOPE BACK IN SEPTEMBER. TALKING ABOUT THE MEDICAL AID IN DYING EDUCATING BUT THE ONE OF THE BIGGEST OBSTACLES THAT WOULD THAT I FACE PERSONALLY AND OUR COMPANY FACES IS. DOCTORS OUT THERE DO NOT KNOW BOARD THEY KNOW THEY DON'T WANT TO BRING IT UP- AND THAT HURTS THE PATIENTS AT THE END OF THE DAY. FOUR THEY GET REFER TO DIFFERENT HOSTAGES CITIES. SAYING YES WE DO I'M BASED ACT THINKING THE PATIENTS WILL DIE EARLIER. BUT THEN. AT THE END WHEN THEY SAY NO WE WANT TO DO IT THEN THAT'S WHEN THEY'LL START LOOKING FOR US ONLINE OR- WORD OF MOUTH OR BY EIGHT COMPASSION CHOICERS ARE AND THE LIFE OPTIONS YOU KNOW THEY'LL FIND US SOMEWHERE. SO THAT'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST OBSTACLES AND YOU KNOW IF INSTITUTIONS LIKE CITY OF HOPE AND KAISER AND WHATEVER. IF THEY CANNOT DO IT IN HOUSE AND THEY WOULD LOOK OUT AND REFERRED TO THE AGENCIES THAT CAN DO THIS. IT WOULD MAKE IT SO MUCH EASIER FOR THE PATIENT I GOT A CALL FROM A HOSPITAL IN LONG BEACH ON FRIDAY WE HAD A PATIENT THAT MY SON ACTUALLY SERVICED. THE NURSE PRACTITIONER CALLED AND SAID YOU KNOW YOU GUYS ARE SO AHEAD OF THE GAME SHE SAID YOU GUYS STREAMLINED THIS PROCESS IT TOOK US SEVENTEEN DAYS. FROM START TO FINISH AND THAT FAMILY WAS LOOKING FOR AN AGENCY FOR OVER THREE YEARS. THAT WOULD ACTUALLY TAKE THAT ON. SO WE HAVE STREAMLINED THE PROCESS WHERE- WE KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING WE KNOW ALL THE FORMS WE KNOW ALL YOU KNOW OUR DOCTORS WE DO USE TELEMEDICINE AS THE SECOND VISIT. OUR DOCTOR DOES THE FACE TIME WHICH HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY HELPFUL BECAUSE THAT CUTS THE TIME. SO WHEN OUR SECOND DOCTOR DOES THE FACE TIME THE THIRD THE ATTENDING GOES OUT THE SAME NIGHT OR THE NEXT DAY. FROM THAT POINT ON PRESCRIPTIONS FILLED PATIENT GETS IT IN TWO DAYS AND THEN WE ARE THERE TO STAY WITH THEM UNTIL THE END. A WE HAVE CONTINUES CARE NURSES BY BEDSIDE THROUGHOUT THE END. SO WE'VE KIND OF LIKE TAKEN THIS WHOLE. MEDICAL AID IN DYING AND IT'S LIKE A WHOLE DIFFERENT SECTION OF HOSPICE CARE FOR- IT CAN'T BE WITH. OUT EACH OTHER BECAUSE WE'RE A TEAM BUT WITH OUR SOCIAL WORKER AND A BEREAVEMENT AND THE MEDICAL DOCTORS ONBOARD AND- THANK GOD I HAVE A GREAT TEAM OF NURSES THAT ARE. SUPPORTIVE OF THIS. SO THAT'S WHAT WE DO AND WE ARE IN LOS ANGELES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE YOU'RE WELCOME THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HI I'M US TO CANCEL FROM MISSION HOSPICE AND HOME CARE AND SOME A TALE. WHERE THE LONGEST SERVING- NONPROFIT IN THAT COUNTY- ONE OF THE FEW REMAINING WE'VE RECENTLY PARTNERED- WITH- SANTA CRUZ AND- SAN DIEGO TO STRING FORCES WITH OTHER NON A NON PROFITS- TO HELP DEVELOP. THE STRENGTH FOR EACH OTHER AND FOR PATIENTS- SO I EAT AT I HAD NOTES THAT I WAS GONNA MMHM. SO WE'LL SEE- IT I STARTED- GRADUATED- FROM NURSING SCHOOL IN TWENTY FIFTEEN A IT WAS A COMING LICENSE IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND THEN WAS HIRED BY MISSION HOSPICE- EARLY AND IN MARCH AND TWENTY SIXTEEN AND- AND- THE CONVERSATION ABOUT THE APPROACHING OR PENDING POTENTIAL LAW PASSING. STARTED AND WITH THE COMPANY TO DO WAS HAVE A CONVERSATION- AMONGST. OF YOU DIRECTORS AND THE BOARD AND THEN EXTEND THE CONVERSATION TO AND MANAGERS AND EMPLOYEES- ABOUT- OPTING IN AND SUPPORTING END OF LIFE OPTION ACT WHICH WE DID. AND HAVE BEEN- ACTIVE ACTIVELY SUPPORTING- SINCE THEN WE HAVE. THREE DOCTORS WHO- WILL- AND PARTICIPATE- WE CAN- WE SOMETIMES HAD GET REFERRALS FROM- COMMUNITY DOCTORS AND THEN ONE OF OUR DOCTORS WILL THEN- TO THE SECOND VISIT OR- IF SOMEBODY INITIATES HELLO A WHEN END OF LIFE MEDICAL AID IN DYING. AT THE- ONCE OUR ON OUR SERVICE BUT TWO OF OUR DOCTORS CAN ACTUALLY PROVIDE THOSE TWO VISITS- WE- IN AN OF THAT SOMETIME YOU KNOW EVERY IT'S JUST IT'S SUCH A WIDE VARIETY OF CASES WE HAVE SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE. YOUNGER THE FIRST PATIENT I WORKED WITH IT WAS MUCH OLDER ACT I ACTUALLY WAS NOT OUR CASE MANAGER BUT I- BUT I WAS ASKED TO STEP IN AND SHE WAS IN HER LATE EIGHTIES. I AM SO SOME. ARE NO THEY KNOW WHERE THEY'RE GOING THEY KNOW WHERE THEY'RE HEADED THERE IF THEY THEY WANT TO GET. THEIR PLAN IN PLACE TO GET THE MEDICATIONS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. AND THEN THEY CAN. THEN THEY CAN MAKE THE DECISION ABOUT WHEN- I AM CURRENTLY WORKING WITH A- I'M CASE MANAGER TO ALSO KNOW CLINICAL AT MANAGER. COMES OVER TO THE OFFICE BY STILL HAVE SOME PATIENTS IN THE FIELD. AND ONE OF MY PATIENTS IS INFECTION WALKED THE HOLES. HERE THE NIGHT BEFORE I GUESS THE LAW PASSED THEM TRYING TO. TO YOU KNOW GET OUT HIS LAST WORDS MMHM MMHM AND- SO SHE'S ON OUR SERVICE NOW SHE'S- AT MINIMAL REQUESTING MINIMAL SERVICE FROM HOSPICE. SHE WANTS TO REMAIN IN SHE WANTS HER QUALITY OF LIFE I MEAN THAT THAT'S THE QUALITY OF LIFE IS CIRCLE. AND SHE GETS TO GO OUT TO. LUNCH AND SPEND TIME WITH THE FAMILY. INCREASING PAIN SHE HAS LUNG CANCER WITH MINUTES THE BRAIN TO THE BONE. SO SYMPTOMS ARE INCREASING BUT AND SHE'S NOT YET DECIDED IF SHE WILL ACTUALLY DO IT BUT SHE IS SET TO GO. AND SHE KNOWS IT'S THERE SO IT HAS FREED HER- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT. THAT AND I JUST HOPE ALONG COME. WITH THE- AN NURSE IS INVOLVED IN AN END OF LIFE IN. YOU KNOW THE- WHO IN SUBMIT MEDICAID YES WHICH THE- ON USUAL MISS OF THIS THAT WE WALK IN AND WE SIT WITH PEOPLE. AT THE END- AND WHILE THE INGESTRE MEDICATION AND- HOW FOR FREEING IT IS FOR THE PATIENT BUT ALSO FOR THE FAMILY. AND TO WATCH THEIR IF IT'S APPROPRIATE YOU KNOW WE SIT WITH THEM THROUGHOUT THE DAY. UNTIL THE PATIENT PASSES BUT HOW FREEING IT IS FOR THE FAMILY AS WELL THERE'S A YOU KNOW WHEN PEOPLE PASSED SUDDENLY OR PEOPLE EVEN HAVE BEEN UNDER HOSPICE SERVICE NAY DIE NATURALLY- WITHOUT. WITHOUT MEDICAL AID IN DYING SOMETIMES THERE'S MORE BEREAVEMENT SERVICES NEEDED BUT IT'S TYPICALLY NOT THE CASE THAT SOMEONE WITH END OF LIFE- OPTION ACT- WHO INGESTED- TYPICALLY THE FAMILIES. THERE WITH THEM EVERYONE AT EIGHT YEAH SO- IN TERMS OF STATISTICS AND WHAT WE TRY TO RETRIEVE SOME STATISTICS AND YOU KNOW AT. ONE POINT LATER DAY WILL RETRIEVE THOSE- BUT PROBABLY pWE'VE WE'VE- BEEN WITH A HUNDRED AND THIRTY PATIENTS- I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE- YOU KNOW HAVE THE MEDICATION RUN OUT OF TIME. HAVE MEDICATION CHOOSE NOT TO OR OR- YOU KNOW. IT RUNS THE GAMUT TO I'VE HAD PEOPLE SAY YOU KNOW I JUST WANNA GO BARGAIN TAKE A PILL. AND I SEE NO. YOU CAN THAT HERE. YOU KNOW AND- I THINK ONE OF THE BIG. CHALLENGES IS THAT WE CAN'T SAY ANYTHING I MEAN AS A NURSE I CAN'T SAY ANYTHING I CAN'T BRING UP THE TOPIC. BUT THE INSTANT THERE'S ANY QUESTION I CAN IN THE INSTANT THERE'S A QUESTION I COMMUNICATE THAT TO THE MD AND THE TEAM IS ON IT. I THINK THAT'S THAT'S ALL. YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS ELAINE IS NOT A LOT OF SKIN I AM THE VICE PRESIDENT OF PATIENT EXPERIENCE FOR SEASONS HOT HEALTH CARE WE CURRENTLY OPERATE IN NINETEEN STATES FOUR OF WHICH HAVE. A RESPECTED END OF LIFE OPTION ACT. AND SEVEN SITES HERE IN CALIFORNIA ALONE- I ALSO HAPPEN TO BE THE MEMBER A MEMBER OF THE- ETHICS ADVISORY COUNCIL FOR AN H. P. C. OF THE NATIONAL HOSPICE AND PALLIATIVE CARE ORGANIZATION. AND ONE OF THE SUB WORKGROUP THAT I SIT ON IS A WORK GROUP THAT IS PROVIDING RESOURCES TO- AGENCIES HOSPICE AGENCY SPECIFICALLY WHO ARE BOTH IN GAS STATES. WHO HAVE A LOT AND NO STATES WHO DO NOT HAVE A LOT BECAUSE THERE ARE IN FACT. CROSSOVER CHALLENGES THAT NEXT FROM NOT. BECAUSE WE'RE A NATIONAL AGENCY IN MANY HAVE BROUGHT UP FEDERAL BENEFITS VERSUS STATE. AND WE HAVE TAKEN A POSITION OF ENGAGED NEUTRALITY WHICH HONORS PATIENT CHOICE. AND WE ARE VERY LUCKY OUR TAGLINE IS HONORING LIFE AN OFFERING HOPE WE WERE ALREADY IN OREGON WHEN THE STATE WHEN THE WHEN THE LAW PASSED IN CALIFORNIA. AND SO WE WERE REALLY ABLE TO GET AHEAD OF IT. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DID WAS WE DID CHANGE OUR PROTOCOL SO WE HAD QUITE A FEW INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE- VERY STRONG PATIENT ADVOCATES AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL AT THE SITE LEADERSHIP LEVEL AND AT THE SITE LEVEL SO PEOPLE STOP. AND WE SAT TOGETHER AND WE LOOKED AT THE CURRENT PROTOCOL THAT WE HAD FOR OREGON AND DECIDED THAT IT DIDN'T QUITE HIT OUR TAGLINE OF HONORING LIFE AND OFFERING HOPE. AND SO WE REALLY CREATE ED A PROTOCOL THAT WAS KIND OF UNIQUE AT THE TIME AND I'M REALLY FORTUNATE TO HEAR MORE AND MORE THAT. OTHER PROTOCOLS ARE CHANGING IN LINE WITH THAT. SO THE THREE DISTINCT ELEMENTS OF OUR PROTOCOL WERE THAT. THEY HAD TO INVOLVE THEIR NDP THAT'S THEIR NATIONAL DIRECTOR OF PATIENT EXPERIENCE SO. THAT INDIVIDUAL IS. A PATIENT EXPERIENCE FOR US IS EVERYTHING PSYCHO SOCIAL AND ETHICS RELATED. SO THEY HAD TO INVOLVE THAT INDIVIDUAL AND THEY HAVE TO INVOLVE THE REGIONAL HOSPICE MEDICAL DIRECTOR AND THE REASONS FOR THAT WAS BOTH TO SUPPORT THE STAFF. TO MAINTAIN STATISTICS RELATED TO HOW MANY PATIENTS PURSUED TO THE ACT IN ANY AT ANY STOP ON THE JOURNEY. AND ALSO TO PROVIDE SUPPORT TO THE LEADERSHIP. THE SECOND IS AS WE DO ALLOW OUR PHYSICIANS TO ACT AS ATTENDING OR CONSULTING'S BY LAW IF THEY SO CHOOSE. ON THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN OUR CASE SINCE THE LAW WAS PASSED IN CALIFORNIA AND ACTUALLY JUST PRIOR TO ITS PASSING IN CALIFORNIA. THE LAST IS THAT WE ALLOW OUR STAFF TO BE PRESENT AT TIME OF INGESTION. IT FELT VERY AWKWARD TO HAVE STOPPED STEP AWAY AT THE TIME OF INGESTION AND THEN BE TOLD IT'S OKAY YOU CAN GO BACK INTO PER EVENING NOW. SO WE'VE WE'VE ALLOWED OUR STAFF TO BE PRESENT AT TIME OF INGESTION ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE NOTICED THAT JUST CHANGED SINCE THE LAST HEARING. IS THAT OUR STAFF HAS BECOME SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER AT OFFERING TRUE INFORMED CONSENT. UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU BROUGHT UP THAT YOU CAN'T INITIATE THE DIALOGUE WE ALLOW THEM TO INITIATE THE DIALOGUE AROUND CHOICES- AND THEN. KNOWING THAT THEY CAN NUMBER FOR THAT BACK TO THE ATTENDING PHYSICIAN WHO WILL THAT AND WALK THEM THROUGH ITS ACTUALLY. REASONABLE FOR THEM SO THEY WILL SHARE CHOICES LIKE- PALLIATIVE SEDATION IF IT'S MEDICALLY INDICATED THEY WILL SHARE CHOICES LIKE V. SIDE VOLUNTARY STOPPING OF EATING AND DRINKING THEY WILL SHARE. AND OF LIFE OPTIONS ACT WITH THE PATIENTS SO THAT THEY REALLY UNDERSTAND IT AND THEY WILL BE MINDFUL OF THE FACT THAT THERE IS A CLAUSE IN THE LAW AROUND THE NEXT OF KIN NOT KNOWING. NECESSARILY WITHOUT PERMITS EXPLICIT PERMISSION FROM THE PATIENT. WE STARTED EARLY EDUCATION ROLL OUT BEFORE THE LAW WAS IMPLEMENTED IN CALIFORNIA AND WE LEARNED ANOTHER UNIQUE THING. HOW WE AS LEADERS PRESENTED THE LAW. MADE AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT PRESENTATION AND HOW ARE STAFF. RECEIVED THAT INFORMATION AND SO WHAT WE'VE DONE SINCE THE LAST HEARING IS WE HAVE OUR OF. OUR RIGHTS STATEMENT. AND THEN THREE SPECIFIC TASKS THAT ARE AT THE START AND FRAMEWORK OF EVERY EDUCATION SESSION. THE STATEMENT IS THIS IS A DIVISIVE TOPIC. CLEAR BUT WE ARE ADDRESSING THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM. AND THE THREE ELEMENTS THAT WE REQUIRE IS THAT THEY KNOW THE LAW OF THE STATE THAT THEY'RE IN. THAT THEY KNOW OUR PROTOCOL AND UNDERSTAND OUR PROTOCOL INCLUDING ITS LIMITATIONS. AND THAT THEY DEMONSTRATE HUMILITY. IRRESPECTIVE OF WHERE THEY AS A STAFF MEMBER STAND ON NOT LAW TO BE GOOD SUPPORTS FOR EACH OTHER AS COLLEAGUES BECAUSE THERE ARE OTHER DIVISIVE TOPICS THAT WE HAVE AND WE EXPERIENCE AND HOSPICE CARE AND SO THE SHOULD BE NO DIFFERENT AND WE'VE NOTICED A TREMENDOUS SHIFT IN HOW THE EDUCATION IS RECEIVED. AND WE'VE NOTICED THAT MANY OF OUR STAFF MEMBERS WE HAVE CHAMPIONS OF OUR SITES THAT JUST BECOME THE EXPERTS IN KNOWING WHAT THE LAW STATES WHAT THE PROTOCOL IS BECAUSE EVEN SOME OF THEM WHO ARE NOT PARTICIPATING- BECAUSE THEY FEEL LIKE THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF THE HUMILITY AND BEING A GOOD TEAM MEMBER. AB IN OUR CURRENT STATE SINCE TWENTY SEVENTEEN. WE HAVE HAD A HUNDRED PATIENTS AVAIL THEMSELVES OF THE LAW AND MANY MORE THAT HAVE JOURNEYED THROUGH- AT VARIOUS PHASES LIKE MANY OTHERS HAVE SAID A LOT OF OUR CHALLENGES ARE RELATED TO ACCESS AN- HOUR EVEN ARE EDUCATION INCLUDE OUR VERY FIRST EXPERIENCE WAS ACTUALLY A PATIENT IN OREGON. WHO WAS APART WAS UNDER HOSPICE AGENCIES CARE NOT OUR OWN WHEN THEY WALKED HER THROUGH THE LAW THEY TOOK HER ALL THE WAY TO THE POINT OF WRITING A PRESCRIPTION AND THEN THEY DROPPED HER FROM SERVICE. AND OUR TEAM IT WAS OUR VERY FIRST EXPERIENCE IN OUR TEAM DIDN'T QUITE KNOW WHAT TO DO WE DID HAVE A PROPER PROTOCOL IN PLACE BUT FIRST EXPERIENCES CAN BE A LITTLE ROCKY. AND THEY WERE ABLE TO WALK HER THROUGH THE ATTENDING PHYSICIAN THAT HAD WRITTEN THE SCRIPT FOR HER. AB WITHOUT GOING INTO A LOT OF DETAILS WAS TOLD BY THE AGENCY THAT IF YOU WRITE TO THE SCRIPT AND PURSUE AND CONTINUE THIS. YOU WILL BE TERMINATED FROM EMPLOYMENT. AND HE RESIGNED ON THE SPOT AND WALKED OUT. AND SO HE WAS ABLE TO CONTINUE THE PROCESS WITH US AND WE WERE VERY LUCKY BECAUSE OTHERWISE SHE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CONTINUE THE PROCESS WHAT WAS SAD AND WHAT WE LEARNED IN THE EXPERIENCE WAS. AND MANY OF SAID IF THERE WAS SOME RECIPROCITY OR SOME PORTABILITY FROM ONE PLACE TO THE NEXT IT COULD MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE SHE REALLY WANTED THE SOCIAL WORKER AND THE CHAPLAIN AND THE NURSE THAT SHE HAD BEOME CLOSE TO IN THE OTHER AGENCY TO BE PRESENT. SHE EIGHT ZERO RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR STAFF MEMBERS WHEN SHE CAME ON BOARD AND VERY LITTLE TIME. TO TRULY BE ABLE TO UTILIZE THE LAW AND SO IN PLACE WHAT SHE DID WAS SHE EXT LEAST ACCEPTED OUR EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND A CLINICAL DIRECTOR TO BE PRESENT AT BEDSIDE BUT MISSED THE OTHER ELEMENTS AND ATOMS HER PLEA. AND SO IT WAS SOMETHING WE HAD LOW AROUND. OUR PRESENCE OUR PRESENCE FROM THE BEGINNING THROUGH TO THE END. AND ALSO OUR INVOLVEMENT IN ENGAGEMENT WITH MANY OTHER AGENCIES CROSS COLLABORATING INTRA. AGENCY AS WELL. AND SOME OF THE OTHER ACCESS ISSUES ARE STILL A COMMON HOSPICE ISSUE IT'S NOT A SPECIFIC ISSUE TO THE LAW IT'S THE AVERAGE LENGTH OF STAY IS STILL VERY SHORT. HOSPICE REFERRALS ARE COMING TOO LATE SO IF A HOSPITAL SYSTEM OR A PHYSICIAN IS NOT PARTICIPATING. THEY'RE REFERRING THE PATIENT FAR LEADER THAT NOT FIFTEEN DAY WINDOW MAY ALLOW THEM TO PROCESS THROUGH. AND THERE IS A LACK OF PROVIDERS SO WE ARE VERY FORTUNATE WE HAVE A NUMBER OF OUR PHYSICIANS WHO ARE BOTH ATTENDING AND CONSULTING BY LAW. AND UNTIL WE STARTED USING TELEMEDICINE FOR THE CONSULTING PIECE THEY WERE FLYING ALL ACROSS CALIFORNIA TO ENSURE THESE PATIENTS WERE ABLE TO TAKE WITHIN THEIR TIMELINE BUT THEN WHAT THEY ARE SORT OF PERFECT END OF LIFE EXPERIENCE RENT OF LIFE. HE WOULD LOOK LIKE. AND THEN THE FINANCIAL AND BILLING WHICH CONTINUES TO CAUSE SOME SOCIAL INEQUITIES. HAS BEEN REALLY CHALLENGING FOR A LOT OF OUR PATIENTS AND FAMILIES THAT'S ONE OF THE LIMITATIONS OF OUR PROTOCOL THAT WE SHARE. THAT WE TALK ABOUT WE'VE BEEN LUCKY ON OCCASION WITH PRIVATE INSURANCE AGENCIES BEING ABLE TO CALL AND- MAKE A CASE FOR A PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL BUT THE NEXT TIME WE CALL THEM WE HAVE TO START THAT CASE ALL OVER AGAIN FOR NEW INDIVIDUAL. AND THEN THE FACILITY OPT OUT HAD BEEN A TREMENDOUS CHALLENGE FOR US AS WELL- WE DO HAVE EXCEPTIONAL SOCIAL WORKERS. WHO WILL HELP US MOVE PATIENTS AND GET THEM INTO ANOTHER. SPACE BUT THERE ARE FACILITIES THAT HAVE REALLY CAUSED SOME BARRIERS TO GETTING THEM THERE AND SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'D LIKE TO CONTINUE WORKING OUT. I THINK THAT'S THE BIGGEST PIECE OF WHAT'S GONE ON WITH US SO I THINK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE. FOR ENGAGING AND CONTINUING THIS CONVERSATION ALLOWING US TO ALL LEARN FROM ONE ANOTHER AND GET TO KNOW ONE ANOTHER SO THAT WE CAN. REALLY HELP OUR PATIENTS ON WHAT THEY'RE PERFECT END OF LIFE JOURNEY LOOKS LIKE. THANK YOU THANK YOU. CAN I WANT TO THANK ALL THREE OF YOU FOR PIONEERING IN YOUR INSTITUTIONS IN YOUR COMMUNITIES. STATE OF CALIFORNIAN BEYOND. I DID WANNA CLARIFYING A QUESTION FOR NURSE CANCEL YOU INDICATED I MIGHT HAVE MISUNDERSTOOD BUT THAT YOU DON'T AFFIRMATIVELY MAKE PEOPLE AWARE OF THEIR CHOICES THAT THAT'S- MAYBE THE STAFF AS A NURSE AND AM IN THE HOME AND I MEAN UNLESS SOMEBODY ASKS ME ABOUT IT. I CAN'T BRING IT OUT OF A DOCTOR CAN- IT IN I DON'T KNOW BEEN FAIRLY THIS NOT LAW. IS THAT YOUR INTERPRETATION OF THE LAW OR YOUR INSTITUTIONS IMPLEMENTATION POLICY. POLICY AND RIGHT ON A POLICY THAT SO IN FACT THERE WERE THE- FOR A WHILE THE DOCTORS WERE. THEY WERE JUST WAITING FOR PATIENTS TO BRING AN OFFENSE BUT NOW THEY CAN AND NOW THEY DO- YES NO WAY I DO WANT TO CLARIFY THAT IN THAT IS PART OF IS WE DISCUSSED DURING THE PHYSICIAN TRAINING. SOME WHO OPT OUT DO THEY HAVE AN OBLIGATION MORAL OBLIGATION TO MAKE PEOPLE AWARE. THERE'S NOT CURRENTLY A LEGAL OBLIGATION IN IN THE LAW AS WRITTEN TODAY BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT I THINKS BEING LOOKED AT AND IF A DOCTOR IS DOES NOT OFTEN HE HE WILL PASS THE- YOU KNOW PASSED THE PATIENT ON FOR ANOTHER DOCTOR WHO IS IMPORTANT. IT'S BEEN MY EXPERIENCE IS THAT OUR DOCTORS DON'T WITHHOLD. IN THAT INFORMATION QUESTION. THANK YOU AND DID YOU HAVE A- ON THE WAY WE HANDLE THAT SITUATION IS WHEN WE GO OUT TO DO A AND- YOU WILL BE EXPLANATION OF BENEFITS. I DO. I DO IT AS WELL IF I FEEL LIKE THE FAMILY BECAUSE SOME FAMILIES ARE SOMETIMES EMBARRASSED. THAT I WANT TO BRING IT UP. THEY DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT THEY FEEL LIKE THEY'RE GOING TO BE THE CAUSE OF THEIR PARENTS TO DIE OR THEIR EAST YOU KNOW THEY WANT TO START THE PROCESS SO. I KINDA LIKE LOOK AT THE FAMILY DYNAMIC AND THIS HAS HAPPENED A LOT AND YOU KNOW WHEN THEY SAY WHEN CAN WE USE MORPHINE OR WHENCAN WE DO THIS. SO I DO SAY YOU KNOW OUR COMPANY ARE ONLY IF YOU ARE AWARE BUT OUR COMPANY DOESN'T BASED AND THE LIFE OPTION ACT. SO IT'S SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT WE CAN GIVE YOU MORE INFORMATION ON THIS YOU CAN YOU KNOW WILL GIVE YOU ALL THE PAPERWORK HE WOULD NEED. OUR DOCTORS DO SUPPORT IT WE DO A TO PRESCRIBE IT AND- YOU COULD SEE THIS. OR OF COME. COMING ON TO THEM WERE DAY KNOW THAT THAT IS AN OPTION AND- THEY HAVE USED IT. AND THEY HAVE LISTENED SO THAT'S THE WAY WE HANDLE IT RIGHT IN AS WE MOVE THE LEGISLATION THROUGH I THINK ONE OF OUR ASPIRATIONS. WAS TO RAISE AWARENESS ABOUT HOSPICE AND PALLIATIVE CARE AS WELL AND I THINK WE HAVE A LEAST ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE THAT. THERE'S BEEN GREATER UPTAKE. IN JUST MORE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT END OF LIFE OPTIONS WHICH IS ONE OF THE GOALS. IN I DID HAVE A QUESTION FOR SOUNDS LIKE YOU ARE USING TELEMEDICINE FOR THE CONSULTATIONS. IN I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT- I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY PROHIBITION IN THE- PROVISION IS NOT RIGHT. WE HAVE AS WELL. MMHM IN THAT ARE IN I REPRESENT AN AREA THAT. IS LARGELY RURAL IN. PUTTING SAN LUIS OBISPO WE HAD A PATIENT THERE WHO HAD TO. BECAUSE OF OP DOWN INSTITUTIONS IN THAT. COMMUNITY HAD TO TRAVEL TO U. C. L. A. FOR. FIRST CONSULTATION OUR CONSUL IT CETERA. IN THAT SENSE FOUR FOUR AND A HALF HOUR DRIVE AND GET THOSE CALLS A LOT FROM LIKE THE WORLD AREAS IT CAN GO UP THERE AND WE CAN ADMIT WE CAN DO IT BUT THEN IF WE GET A PRN CALL IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT IT'S GOING TO BE A THREE FOUR HOUR DRIVING YOU DON'T WANT TO COMMIT TO SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN. OUR PREFERENCES TO BE PRESENT OBVIOUSLY ON OUR PHYSICIANS PREFERENCES TO BE PRESENT AND AT EVERY ONSULT THE PHYSICIAN WILL ALWAYS CALL ME HEY CAN WE TALK THROUGH THIS CASE WHICH IS A LOT FOR HUNDRED CASES YEAH BUT I LOVE SPEAKING TO THEM WHAT WE HOW WE DO MANAGE ABOUT FROM THE COERCION ANGLE BECAUSE THAT'S ALWAYS A CONCERN THAT THE OR THE ETHICS AND FULL OF IT IS THAT WE TRY AND ENSURE THAT A STAFF MEMBER OF OURS. IS PRESENT AT THE BEDSIDE AT THE SAME TIME ESPECIALLY IF THE PATIENT HAS INDICATED THAT THEY DO NOT WANT ANY OF FAMILY ARE OF KIN TO BE AWARE- WE'VE SADLY HAD TO STILL CASES OF THAT AND SO IT'S CAUSED US TO CREATE. A I NEED TO PROVIDE A GREATER SOME WORST. NOT SOME THAT WERE PUTTING INTO IS THAT AND TING A CALL FOR THEM. ESPECIALLY IN THE SCENARIOS STAFF NOW WILL BE PRESENT. AND WE WILL USE. OUR INTER SKYPE FOR BUSINESS SOME VERY. OF PROTECTED TELEMEDICINE IF I MAY ADD WHEN WE ARE. I MEAN WE OBVIOUSLY IT'S PATIENT WHO'S MAKING A DECISION WE APPROACH AND IF THEY APPROACH US THEN WE INFORM THEM. WE DON'T IF A FAMILY MEMBER I DON'T TYPICALLY EVER- RESPOND TO- IF I'D FAMILY MEMBER. ASKS ABOUT IT I MEAN I CAN TELL THEM WHAT IT IS BUT I DON'T. IT THIS IS NOT A SUBJECT THAT A- THAT I NEED TO COVER WITH THEM ABOUT THE PATIENT- BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF IF SOMEBODY'S IN A FACILITY THE LAWS I UNDERSTAND. IS NOT. ENOUGH. AS A- AS THAT IS. AT YOU KNOW WE HAVE PATIENTS. IN FACILITIES. THE FACILITY WERE NOT INFORMED. BECAUSE IT'S THE LAW THAT THE PATIENT THE PAGE IS THE PATIENTS. IT IS THERE IT'S THEIR RIGHT THEY DON'T HAVE TO TELL ANYBODY THEY COULD TAKE THAT MEDISAVE MEDICATION ONCE THEY GET IT AND HAVE IT IN THE ROOM AND GET WITHOUT IS PRESENT. WE WANT TO BE PRESIDENT- WE DO INFORMED WE HAVE- IN SERVICES FOR FACILITIES AND LET THEM KNOW ABOUT END OF LIFE OPTION EQUITY AND LET THEM KNOW ABOUT PARTICIPATION SO THEY KNOW IT'S YOU KNOW THEY KNOW THAT THEY UNDERSTAND THE LAW- BUT- I THINK THE CHALLENGES WE'VE HAD WITH SOME OF THAT IS THERE ARE FACILITIES THAT HAVE PARTICULAR PROTOCOLS AROUND FEEDING PATIENTS. AND WE KNOW THAT THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE AN INNOCENT ORDER FOR A PATIENT TO BE ABLE TO INGEST AND TO BE ABSORBED IN SOME RESPECT SO. HE WE USUALLY HAVE THE PATIENT ACKNOWLEDGE AND MANY MANY OF THE TIMES WHEN WE GET A FACILITY FOR ALL IT'S USUALLY THE ADDITION SPOKEN TO THE FACILITY WHOSE THEN NOTIFIED US AND THEN THEY SAID WE'RE GONNA DO THIS YOU GUYS HAVE TO MOVE THIS NATION OR WHATEVER VARIATION OF MY- THREE. THANK YOU CHAIR AND AFTER EXT MYSELF MY STAFF IS GOING TO BE MY- THE PATIENT TESTIMONY IN PUBLIC. TED SO WE WILL HEARING IT IN. AGAIN I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR FOR. ASSISTANCE THIS THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENCE TODAY YOU ARE VERY MUCH FOR YOUR WORK. GIVE ME ONE PUT DOWN HIS GAVEL AND IS GO BACK TO. THANK YOU. OKAY I NEXT WE WILL HAVE THE PATIENT PANEL HAD SPINAL BY MCKEON JULIE STROUD AMANDA VIEGAS IN SHERRIN FELLS. AND I AND I WILL SAY I WAS THE AUTHOR OF A LAW THE YEAR BEFOREWE PASS THIS ONE. IT IS BECAUSE IT USED TO BE IF A IF THE PATIENT ASKED YOU KNOW DO I HAVE TERMINAL ILLNESS ONE OF MY CHOICES THEY HAD ASKED THE POSITION WE FLIP THAT AROUND THAT WHEN SOMEBODY IS GIVEN THE DYING JUST THERE'S TO GO OVER THE FULL SPECTRUM OF OPTIONS THAT PEOPLE HAVE. TO THAT THAT IS THE LAW. OKAY WELCOME THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR SITTING THROUGH A- ALONG HEARING BUT WE THINK IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR EVERYBODY'S VOICE TO BE HEARD. SO I THINK. WE'RE HERE FOR. DON'T KNOW WHO'D LIKE TO START. THANK HI GOOD MORNING THANK YOU FOR HAVING US HERE AND- LISTENING TO THIS VERY IMPORTANT DISCUSSION MY NAME'S AMANDA VIEQUES- ON JUNE NINETEENTH OF.

WHAT WE ENVISIONED AS A JOYOUS TIME OF PICKING INVITATIONS AND ENJOYING OUR HONEYMOON. TURNED INTO A QUICK COURT ROOM WEDDING AND A NIGHTMARE FULL OF HOSPITAL VISITS CHEMOTHERAPY CATHETERS NEEDLES AND MACHINES. SORRY OKAY. WE ANXIOUSLY BETWEEN HOSPITAL STAYS AN OVERLY OPTIMISTIC DOCTOR APPOINTMENTS NAY EVEN AWARE THAT HE WOULD NOT MAKE IT TO HIS THIRTIETH BIRTHDAY. DOCTORS DID NOT DISCLOSE THE NATURE OF HIS PROGNOSIS IN ITS ENTIRETY. OUR OPTIMISM OF ITS FULL RECOVERY NEVER FOR AID UNTIL CHRIS EXPERIENCED AN UNTREATABLE BOWEL OBSTRUCTION CAUSED BY A RAPIDLY GROWING TUMOR THAT HAD INFESTED HIS ABDOMEN. WE HAD JUST WATCHED HIS GRANDMOTHER PASSED FROM THE SAME COMPLICATION JUST TWO YEARS PRIOR. AND WE KNEW THAT HE WOULD NEVER EAT AGAIN. HE WOULD HAVE BEEN THE TUBE TRAINING FECAL MATTER FROM HIS THROAT AND OUT OF HIS NOSE. WE KNEW HE WOULD BE TORTURED. AND TORTURED IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT. HE WOULD NEVER XP FAVORITE MEALS. THE PURELY AWFULLY QUICK WOULD ONLY PROCEEDED BUBBLE WILL HOLD IN THE STORE. THAT WOULDN'T CLOSE. I DON'T WANT TO DIE LIKE MY GRANDMOTHER CHRIS CALMLY TOLD ME. I DON'T WANT TO BE A LIFELESS SHELL. WHAT ARE USED TO BE. I WANT LAST WORDS I WANTED DIET ON MY OWN STE. HE DID NOT WANT TO DIE. HE EXPRESSED HIS DISAPPOINTMENT IN NOT HAVING TIME TO DO THE THINGS HE WANTED. HOWEVER HE KNEW HIS MORTALITY WAS IMMINENT AND HE JUST DIDN'T WANT TO SUFFER UNNECESSARILY. HIS REQUEST WAS NOT OUT OF THE ORDINARY MOST PEOPLE DO NOT WANT TO DIE IN IN. UNFORTUNATELY MY HUSBAND DIED EXACTLY HOW HE FEARED MOST WITH TWO TWENTY VARIOUS BODILY FLUIDS NEVER TO PROTRUDE HIS STOMACH KIDNEYS AND TRUST. THE PAIN HE ENTERED WAS UNFATHOMABLE. A SIMPLE SHIFTING MOVEMENT OR ACCIDENTAL BUMP. TO IS BAD LEFT IN AN AGONY. HIS SWOLLEN SKIN WERE BURSTING OPEN FROM THE PRESSURE MEDINA. CHRIS WANTED TO USE CALIFORNIA'S AND OF LIFE OPTION KNOCKED. BUT UNFORTUNATELY A RELIGIOUS HOSPITAL I THINK SYSTEM DENIED MY HUSBAND ITS FINAL WISH TO MAINTAIN SOME COMFORT IN HIS FINAL DAYS SO YOU COULD DIE GENTLY. ONE MEDICAL AID IN DYING. IS LEGAL HERE IN CALIFORNIA IT CAN BE TO ACCESS THIS COMPASSIONATE WHAT. DOCTORS TOLD CHRIS HE HAD LESS THAN TWO WEEKS TO LIVE. THAT MEANT HE WOULD NOT SURVIVE THE MINIMUM FIFTEEN DAY WAITING PERIOD BETWEEN THE FIRST AND SECOND VERBAL REQUESTS FOR MEDICAL AID IN DYING AT THE END OF LIFE. OPTION ACT REQUIRES FOR PATIENTS TO ACCESS AND OF LIFE CARE. MY HUSBAND WAS DENIED OF LIFE. AND THE PEACEFUL DEATH. HE IS NOT AN ANOMALY I KNOW THERE ARE OTHER SUFFERING RIGHT NOW AND BEING DENIED THIS HUMAN RIGHT IN MY OPINION. MORE THAN THREE OUT OF FOUR CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT THE END OF LIFE OPTION ACT ACCORDING TO A TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN POLL BY THE INSTITUTE OF GOVERNMENTAL STUDIES AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY. HOWEVER THERE ARE TOO MANY ROAD BLOCKS FROM ANY DYING CALIFORNIANS TO ACCESS THIS LAW. SOME DOCTORS DO NOT INFORM THEIR PATIENTS OF ALL OF THEIR END OF LIFE OPTIONS AND THERE ARE STILL TOO MANY ROBOTS TO MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR CALIFORNIANS TO DIE PEACEFULLY. FINDING A SUPPORT OF DOCTOR OR FACILITY IS ESPECIALLY CHALLENGING DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU LIVE. AND BY LAW. NO SERVICE TO THE- HOSPITAL'S MAY ALSO PROHIBIT THEIR DOCTORS AFFILIATED WITH THEM FROM PARTICIPATING IN THE LAW. AS EITHER AN ATTENDING OR CONSULTING PHYSICIAN. A RELIGIOUS HOSPITAL IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TREATING CHRIS IS ONE OF MANY FACE BY FAITH BASED HOSPITALS IN THE STATE THAT PROHIBITS DOCTORS TO PRESCRIBE MEDICAL AID IN DYING. THIS HOSPITAL REFERRED US TO A HOSPICE IT BELIEVED WOULD BE WILLING TO PRESCRIBE MEDICAL AID IN DYING. HOWEVER THE HOSPICE MISINFORMED US BY WRONGLY SAYING IT WAS ILLEGAL IN CALIFORNIA AND CONTRADICTED ITSELF BY SAYING THE ONLY A DOCTOR IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA COULD OFFER TO WRITE THIS PRESCRIPTION. ALL OF THIS INFORMATION WAS SIMPLY WRONG AND IN TRUE. THEY ALSO SAID HE WOULD MOST LIKELY NEED TO SIX MONTHS TO COMPLETE THIS ENTIRE PROCESS WHEN IN FACT A PATIENT CAN GET THROUGH THE PROCESS IN A MINIMUM OF FIFTEEN DAYS. THAT FIFTEEN DAYS OF THE SUFFERING MY HUSBAND ENTERED IS STILL TOO LONG. FIFTEEN DAYS OF PAIN THAT CANNOT BE CONTROLLED BY THE HIGHEST NICK RECORDED MEDICATION AND HIM BEGGING TO GO HOME IT'S TOO LONG. HE DID NOT HAVE TIME TO GO THROUGH THAT LINK THE PROCESS AND HE WANTED TO SPEND HIS LAST DAYS IN PEACE HOLDING MY HAND AS I TOLD HIM HOW MUCH I LOVED HIM. I STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT DOCTORS HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS AND HOSPICES SHOULD INITIATE CONVERSATIONS TO ENSURE THAT PATIENTS ARE FULLY INFORMED OF ALL OF THEIR END OF LIFE OPTIONS AND FULLY SUPPORTED IN THEIR VISION THINKING. YES WELL LIFE. HE LOVED ME. HE LIVED HELP PEOPLE IN NEED. BUT HE WAS DENIED. HE MAINTAINED A WILL POWER THAT COULD NOT BE SHATTERED BY THE AGONIZING DEATH THAT OFTEN ACCOMPANIES AGGRESSIVE METASTATIC CANCER. LIFE AND DEATH ARE ONE THEIR INTEGRAL TO EACH OTHER. WHEN HOW ONE LIVES TO LEAVE THIS EARTH IS HIGHLY PERSONAL. WATCHING THE LOVE OF MY LIFE TO END A LITTLE WAY DROWNING IN HIS OWN BODY IN BAKING TO GO HOME WAS EXCRUCIATING I CAN'T THINK OF HIM IN A POSITIVE WAY WITHOUT SEEN HIS FACE AS HE WAS. DYING HE SHOULD NOT HAVE SUPPER THAT WAY. NO ONE SHOULD. AND ALONE ALLOWING THE DYING THE OPTION TO PASS PEACEFULLY IN THEIR FINAL MOMENTS RATHER THAN SUFFER NEEDLESSLY IS NOT ABOUT POLITICS IT'S NOT ABOUT RELIGION OR PRECONCEIVED JUDGMENTS IT'S ABOUT HUMANITY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANNA WE'RE SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR SPEAKING FOR CHRIS THANK YOU. HI I'M JULIE STROUD AND I'M VERY GRATEFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE AND TO SHARE MY FAMILY'S EXPERIENCE WITH CALIFORNIANS AT THE END OF LIFE OPTION THAT. THANK YOU FOR THAT OPPORTUNITY. SO TO GIVE SOME BACKGROUND MY FATHER BARRY STROUD MOVED TO CALIFORNIA IN NINETEEN SIXTY ONE TO TAKE A TEACHING POSITION AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY IN THE DEPARTMENT OF PHILOSOPHY HE TAUGHT THERE FOR OVER FIFTY FIVE. NINE MONTHS AGO AT THE AGE OF EIGHTY FOUR MY BRILLIANT ACTIVE HEALTHY FATHER WAS DIAGNOSED WITH GLIOBLASTOMA MULTIFORME. THE MOST AGGRESSIVE ANDDEADLY FORM OF BRAIN CANCER. WHEN THEY FOUND THE TUMOR IT WAS ALREADY VERY LARGE AND A PANEL OF DOCTORS RECOMMENDED THAT HE FOR CO TREATMENT WHICH WOULD DO MORE HARM THAN GOOD AND ENTER HOSPICE. THEY GAVE HIM A PROGNOSIS OF TWO MONTHS GIVE OR TAKE. I'M NOT VERY FIRST DAY AS WE SAT TOGETHER AS A FAMILY ABSORBING THAT SHOCKING NEWS. ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS WE DISCUSSED WHAT'S CALIFORNIA'S END OF LIFE OPTION. A LOT OF THAT WE HAD CELEBRATED THE PASSAGE OF. AS A FAMILY A FEW YEARS EARLIER. BUT NEVER IMAGINED HOW PROFOUNDLY IT WOULD AFFECT OUR FAMILY. MY EXPRESSED THAT HE HAD NO INTEREST IN THE LONGEVITY OF HIS LIFE INDEPENDENT OF THE QUALITY OF THAT LIFE AND HE MADE THE DECISION TO ENTER KAISER'S HOME HOSPICE PROGRAM. WHEN HE WAS ADMITTED TO HOSPICE HE ADDS THE ADMITTING NURSE FOR INFORMATION ON THE END OF LIFE OPTION AND SHE GAVE HIM THE PHONE NUMBER TO KAISER NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AS AND OF LIFE OPTION PROGRAM. I'D RARELY SEEN DAD NERVOUS BUT HE WAS NERVOUS THE PLACE THAT CALL. HE WANTED TO GET IT RIGHT TO BE SURE THAT HE MET ALL THE REQUIREMENTS AND CHECKED ALL THE BOXES. THE PROGRAM COULDN'T HAVE BEEN MORE STELLAR THEY LOCATED THE PRESCRIBING PHYSICIAN WHO CAME TO MY DAD'S HOUSE WITHIN A WEEK OF HIS FIRST- CALL FOR HIS OR REQUEST. THEN THE FIFTEEN DAY WAITING PERIOD BEGAN AND THOSE WERE AN ANXIOUS FEW WEEKS IN HIS HOUSEHOLD. BECAUSE HE'D ONLY HAD ONCE AGAIN TO FIND THE TUMOR NONE OF US KNEW INCLUDING THE DOCTORS HOW QUICKLY HIS DISEASE WHAT PROGRESS. WE WERE WARNED ABOUT WHAT MIGHT BE COMING WHICH INCLUDED EXCRUCIATING HEADACHES SEIZURES PARALYSIS LOSING THE ABILITY TO SPEAK OR SWALLOW. AND MOST IMPORTANT TO MY PHILOSOPHER OF THE MIND FATHER LOSING THE ABILITY TO THINK. THE WAS TICKING MORE WAYS THAN ONE HE SPENT MANY AN ANXIOUS NIGHT WONDERING AND WORRYING OUT LOUD IF HE'D BE COMPASS MANTIS WHEN THE FINAL APPOINTMENT ARRIVED. LUCKILY HE WAS I REMEMBER HIS FEELINGS OF ACCOMPLISHMENT AND ACHIEVEMENT THAT HE HAD FILLED THE PROGRAM'S REQUIREMENTS. THE PHARMACIST AND PROGRAM COORDINATOR PATIENT COORDINATOR DELIVERED THE AID IN DYING MEDICATION A MONTH AFTER HIS FIRST CALLED THE END OF LIFE OPTION PROGRAM. AFTER THEY LEFT OUR HOUSE HIS RELIEF WAS PALPABLE IT'S HERE HE SAID OF THE MEDICATION IT'S FINALLY HERE. EVER THE AUTHOR AND LECTURER MY DAD HAD BEEN WORKING ON THE STATEMENT HE PLANNED TO MAKE WHEN HE TOOK THE MEDICAID'S AND- IT WAS. I AM TAKING THIS MEDICATION TO AVOID A MANNER OF LIVING THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE FOR A MEETING FULL HUMAN LIFE. THIS STATEMENT BECAME INVALUABLE TO US IT WAS OUR SHARED LANGUAGE BASED ON HIS VALUES WE TALKED ABOUT WHAT A MEANINGFUL HUMAN LIFE MEANT TO HIM. WE EXPLORED WHAT HE FELT HE NEEDED TO COMPLETE IN HIS LIFE BEFORE TAKING THE MEDICATION WE PLANNED WHO HE WOULD WANT IN THE ROOM WHEN HE TOOK IT. AND AS HE AND WORK MORE TAX OF HIS OWN. WE ASKED HIM IF HIS CONDITION WAS UNACCEPTABLE YET. ONE OF THE MOST FASCINATING THINGS IS THAT FINISH LINE KEPT MOVING HIM. THE PRESENCE OF THE MEDICAID IN HIS HOME AND THE OPTION TO TAKE IT WERE EXTRAORDINARILY MEANINGFUL AND IMPORTANT TO MY THAT. IT GAVE HIM PEACE OF MIND. IT ALLEVIATED HIS FEAR AND ANXIETY ABOUT THE PAIN AND SUFFERING HE WOULD BE FORCED TO INDOOR WITHOUT THE MEDICATION AND- AT A TIME WHEN HE WAS LOSING POWER AND CONTROL. OVER EVERYTHING. DAD BUT EXERCISE POWER AND CONTROL OVER HIS MOST PRECIOUS RESOURCE HIS LIFE A LIFE HE LEFT. HE TOLD US THAT THE TRAIN WHAT'S COMING DOWN THE TRACKS. WE COULD ALL SEE IT WE ALL KNEW IT WAS COMING. THE MEDICATION GAVE HIM THE POWER TO REMOVE HIMSELF FROM THE TRACKS IN HIS OWN TIME AND ON HIS OWN TERMS. ULTIMATELY MY DAD DIDN'T INGEST THE MEDICATION AS IT'S CANCER PROGRESSED HE DIDN'T EXPERIENCE THE HEADACHES AND SEIZURES NOTCH- PAIN ASSOCIATED WITH BRAIN CANCER. HE JUST BEGAN TO SLEEP MORE AND MORE HE SLIPPED INTO A COMA FOR LESS THAN THE DAY AND DIED ON AUGUST NINTH JUST TEN WEEKS AFTER HIS DIAGNOSIS. EVEN THOUGH HE DIDN'T TAKE THE MEDICATION I REALIZE NOW THAT IT STARTED WORKING THE MINUTE AND ENTERED HIS HELP. IT HAD THE DESIRED EFFECT AT THE MOST AGONIZING TIME AND ALL OF OUR LIVES. THE MEDICATION BROUGHT US COMFORT. FOR A LECTURE REFLECTING ON HIS LIFELONG LOVE AFFAIR WITH PHILOSOPHY AND HIS ILLUSTRIOUS CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE FIELD MY DAD ONCE WROTE I FEEL AMONG THE MOST FORTUNATE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD'S. HE WAS FORTUNATE EVEN AND HOW HE DIED. HE DESCRIBED THE FINAL MONTHS OF HIS LIFE AS A WONDERFUL TIME DESPITE THE DISMAL CIRCUMSTANCES HE ENJOYED FOOD WINE AND CONVERSATION UNTIL THE FINAL WEEK OF HIS LIFE. HE WAS ABLE TO REFLECT ON HIS LIFE AND RECEIVE ALL BUT LOVE AND A LIVING MEMORIAL THAT FLOODED HIS WAY. AND HE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO REALIZE TO RECOGNIZE THAT WHAT HE HOPED HE HAD BEEN DOING WITH HIS LIFE HE HAD IN FACT DONE. YOU WITH FORTUNATE INDEED FORTUNATE TO LIVE IN THE STATE THE PRIORITIZE THE QUALITY OF HIS DEATH AS MUCH AS THE QUALITY OF ITS LIFE. FORTUNATE TO BE SHEPHERDED THROUGH THIS PROCESS BY THE FANTASTIC KAISER NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND OF LIFE OPTION PROGRAM. FORTUNATE THAT FOR HIM THE PROCESS WENT AS WELL AS IT COULD GO. FORTUNATE TO DIE PEACEFULLY IN HIS OWN HOME SURROUNDED BY HIS FAMILY. MAY WE ALL BE SO FORTUNATE. IN CLOSING I WANT TO THANK YOU AND THANK ALL OF THE IF. MY DAD BERRY IS JUST ONE OF THE STATISTICS YOU'LL HEAR AT NEXT YEAR'S OVERVIEW HEARING. AND THERE ARE HUNDREDS MORE FATHERS BROTHERS MOTHERS SISTERS SONS AND DAUGHTERS HUSBANDS AND WIVES LIKE HIM. EACH ONE HAS THEIR OWN STORY. HE UNDERSTOOD THE GRAVITY OF THE REQUEST THAT HE WAS MAKING FOR MEDICAL AID IN DYING. AND HE HAD A DEEP APPRECIATION AND GRATITUDE FOR THE PRESCRIBING PHYSICIAN CONSULTING PHYSICIAN PATIENT COORDINATOR AND PHARMACIST FIFTH FILLED HIS REQUEST. OUR FAMILY IS INDEBTED TO THE PATIENTS AND FAMILIES WHO TRAVEL THIS ROAD BEFORE US THE ACTIVISTS AND ADVOCATES THE LEGISLATORS WHO SUPPORT CALIFORNIA'S AND OF LIFE OPTION. MY DAD SAID IT TOOK A SPECIAL KIND OF COURAGE. SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR COURAGE. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING I THINK WE'RE I THINK WE'RE IN THE AFTERNOON BUT ARE WE OKAY I'LL TRY TO GO FAST NO YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO FAST IF YOU TAKE YOUR TIME AND YOUR STORY- MY NAME IS BONNIE MCKEE AGAIN I LIVE AND WORK AS A LICENSED CLINICAL SOCIAL WORKER IN GRASS VALLEY WITH THE PART ON MEDICAL SYSTEM DOES NOT ALLOW ITS PROVIDERS TO PARTICIPATE. AM I REALIZE AND LISTENING TODAY THAT SO MUCH OF MY STORY YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD. THIS IS MY MOTHER'S STORY. THIS IS RADICAL REPORT. MY MOTHER FAMILY HERIS MADE HIM FOR ME SIX MONTHS BEFORE SHE WAS UNEXPECTEDLY DIAGNOSED WITH METASTATIC BREAST CANCER IN JUNE TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN. CANCER SHOULD FIRST BATTLED EIGHTEEN YEARS PRIOR WAS IN HER BONES IN ALREADY CAUSING PAIN. FEBRUARY FIFTH TWENTY EIGHTEEN MY MOTHER LEFT ICE GRANTED VENTURE EARLY ONLY A FEW DAYS AHEAD OF THE DREADFUL DEATH CANCER IT WAS BRINGING. SHE DIED PEACEFULLY HOW BY MYSELF AND MY FATHER THANKS TO THE END OF LIFE OPTION. HOWEVER ACCESSING THIS COMPASSIONATE LAW WAS NOT EASY. THERE WERE HURDLES NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO GO THROUGH. THE PROCESS OF ACCESSING LAW ADDED ANXIETY AND DISTRESS FROM MY MOTHER DURING HER LAST DAYS OF LIFE AND FOR MYSELF AND MY FATHER DURING A TIME OF OUR INTENSE GRIEF. MY MOTHER'S GREATEST FEAR OF SUFFERING WHILE DYING CAME FROM WATCHING MY BROTHER SUFFER BEFORE HIS DEATH FROM AN AGGRESSIVE FORM OF SKIN CANCER IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWO. AND FOR HER YEARS OF EXPERIENCE AS A HOSPICE CARE GIVER. SHE KNEW WHAT HER FUTURE WITH TERMINAL BREAST CANCER LOOKS LIKE. WHEN THE PRIMARY CARE DOCTOR GAVE FOR THE NEWS MY MOTHER TOLD MY FATHER IN ME AND I REMEMBER SITTING IN HER LIVING ROOM ON HER COUCH. IF I WASN'T CHICKEN I WOULD GET THE GUN AND GET IT OVER WITH RIGHT NOW. PROMISE ME YOU WON'T LET ME SUFFER. MY DAD PROMISED BUT THERE WAS NO E. L. O. A AT THE TIME SO WE REASSURED HER HOSPICE WOULD PROVIDE THE BEST CARE POSSIBLE WHEN THE TIME CAME. FOR FOUR AND A HALF YEARS MY MOTHER FOUGHT BREAST CANCER WAS SMART DRUGS AND CHEMOTHERAPY AND AROUND OF RADIATION. BUT THE CANCER CONTINUE TO SPREAD TO HER BONES INTO HER LUNGS AND LIVER. MY MOTHER'S PAIN WAS NEVER MANAGED WELL BUT SHE KEPT FIGHTING. BECAUSE OF PAIN IN DECEMBER TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN MY MOM COULD NOT LAY ON THE TABLE FOR THE CT SCAN THAT WOULD HAVE CONFIRMED IF THE CANCER HAD SPREAD TO HER BRAIN. NEVER THE LESS IT WAS OBVIOUS TREATMENT WAS NOT WORKING. SHE WAS IN CONSTANT PAIN LOSING WEIGHT INCREASINGLY ANXIOUS AND AGITATED. BATTLING BAO ISSUES AND SHE WAS SPENDING HER DAYS LYING ON THE COUCH OR IN BED. SHE COULD NO LONGER PUT ON HER HEARINGS. SHE WAS DONE FIGHTING. MY MOM WENT TO HER ONCOLOGIST BEFORE CHRISTMAS AND TOLD HIM SHE WAS READY FOR HOSPICE AND SHE ASKED FOR THE MEDICAL AID IN DYING PRESCRIPTION TO END HER SUFFERING. HAD BROUGHT UP THE MEDICAL AID IN DYING LIGHT TO HER TWICE. PREVIOUSLY ONCE WHEN THE LAW WAS FIRST PASSED. IN THE A YEAR LATER BY GIVING HER A PAMPHLET AND JUST SAYING THIS IS HERE SHE PUT IT AWAY EACH TIME AND WE DID NOT DISCUSS IT. SADLY HER ONCOLOGIST DECLINE TO WRITE THE PRESCRIPTION. HE DID THANKFULLY REFER HER TO A PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN WITHIN SUTTER WHO WOULD WRITE THE PRESCRIPTION. BUT NOT TURN HER OWN DOCTOR BECAUSE THEIR OWN CENTER PCP HE WAS FIFTEEN MINUTES FROM HOME. IT ALSO DECLINED TO WRITE THE PRESCRIPTION. THE DOCTOR WHO WOULD SEE HER WAS AN HOUR'S DRIVE AWAY IN SACRAMENTO. AN HOUR DOESN'T SEEM LIKE MUCH. EXCEPT WHEN YOU'RE DYING. IN PAIN. THE HOSPICE TEAM OUR LOCAL HOSPICE OF THE FOOT HILLS WAS ON BOARD RIGHT AWAY IN THEIR SUPPORT OF THE LAW. WE ASSUME THAT THE FIRST REQUEST OF THE ONCOLOGIST WAS THE FIRST OFFICIAL ASK I SEE NOW THAT'S COMMON THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED WITH US. EVEN AFTER READING ONLINE INFORMATION STILL DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT THAT WASN'T THE FIRST ASK ONCOLOGIST ALSO SEEM THE SAME HE TOLD HER YOU HAVE TO WAIT FIFTEEN DAYS TO SEE THE DOCTOR THAT WILL WRITE THE PRESCRIPTION AS A RESULT MY MOM SCHEDULED THE FIRST AVAILABLE APPOINTMENT BEYONCE THAT FIFTEEN DAYS. OVER THOSE WEEKS MY MOM'S CONDITION CONTINUE TO WORSEN. WE ALKED ABOUT HOW TO MANAGE YOUR PAIN AND ANXIETY FOR THE CAR RIDE TO SACRAMENTO. IT TOOK A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF COURAGE FOR HER TO GET IN THE CAR THAT DAY. THE DOCTOR WAS KIND AND THOROUGH AS HE WENT TO THE PROCESS THEN SAID. YOU HAVE TO COME BACK AFTER FIFTEEN DAYS FOR THE SECOND APPOINTMENT. AND THE CONSULTATIONDOCTOR WILL BE HERE THAT DAY TO. THE DID GRACIOUSLY COORDINATE THOUGHT IT WAS AWESOME. WE ALL WE HAD ALL INCLUDING MEMBERS AND CALL JUST ASSUMED INCORRECTLY THAT THIS WAS THE SECOND APPOINTMENT. MY RESPONSE. WAS YOU'RE KIDDING RIGHT. SHE DOESN'T KNOW SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN MENTAL CAPACITY AND THE ABILITY TO TAKE THE MEDICINE FOR THAT LONG WE ALL THOUGHT THIS WAS THE SECOND APPOINTMENT. THE GRACIOUS DOCTOR WHOM EVER GRATEFUL TO. EXPLAIN THAT BOTH VERBAL ASKS HAD TO BE TO THE SAME DOCTOR FIFTEEN DAYS APART THE FIRST ACT ASK DIDN'T COUNT. I WISH I COULD DRAW A PICTURE OF MY MOM'S FACE DROPPING. PLEASE REMEMBER THIS DOCTOR WAS IN THE SAME MEDICAL SYSTEM AS HER ONCOLOGIST HE HAD ACCESS TO HER RECORDS. HER UNCLE JUST NEVER EXPRESSED ANY CONCERN ABOUT HER CAPACITY HE KNEW THAT SHE- KNEW WHAT SHE WAS ASKING FOR AND THAT SHE WAS GOING TO DIE WITHIN SIX MONTHS AND LIKELY MUCH- MY MOTHER SPENT TWO MORE LONG WEEKS LIVING WITH THE FEAR THAT SHE WOULD OSE THE MENTAL CAPACITY AND PHYSICAL ABILITY NECESSARY TO ACCESS THE LAW. IT SHOULD STILL BE SUFFERING. SHE WAS SO WORRIED ABOUT THE SECOND CAR RIDE. THAT SHE HAD A SPECIAL MEETING WITH A HOSPICE NURSE TO MAKE A PLAN FOR HANDLING HER PAIN AND ANXIETY. MY MOTHER WAS A COURAGEOUS WARRIOR WHO DEALT WITH PAIN AND SUFFERING WITH GRACE. SHE WAS NO CHICKEN SHE SUFFERED FOR YEARS WILL FIGHTING FOR MORE TIME WITH US AT THAT SECOND APPOINTMENT I WATCH TRULY ON THE BED SHE COULD ONLY LAY DOWN. SHE DID NOT HAVE THE ENERGY TO SET UP IN THE CHAIR. SHE LAID CLOSE YOUR EYES AND BREEZE. I WATCHED HER BREATHING AND I WONDERED SHE GONNA DIE RIGHT HERE IN THIS DOCTOR'S OFFICE NOT AT HOME WHERE SHE SHOULD BE BECAUSE OF THIS FIFTY IS. ACTUALLY BEEN THIRTY BY THEN THIRTY TWO FOR MORE. THE DAY AFTER THE DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT THE PICKED UP HER MEDICAL AID IN DYING MEDICATIONS IN SACRAMENTO IT WAS ANOTHER HOUR'S DRIVE FOR ME AT THE CLOSEST COMPOUNDING PHARMACY THE DOCTOR KNEW OF ACCESS TO THE CONTACTING CAMPAIGNING PHARMACIES I THINK THAT'S ANOTHER ISSUE HAVEN'T HEARD TODAY BUT I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING TO THAT YEAH. THE LOCAL COMPOUNDING PHARMACY HAD JUST GONE OUT OF BUSINESS IN GRASS VALLEY SO WE CAN USE THE MARTINIS. HER SECOND POINT WAS ON THURSDAY. AND FRIDAY PICKED UP HER MEDICATON ON SATURDAY SHE LOST HER BATTLE. UNDERWAY FROM THE BED TO THE BATHROOM IN HER ROOM. MY FATHER WAS A PRIMARY CARE GIVER AND I LIVE NEXT DOOR. THIS WAS THE INDIGNITY. THAT SHE DID NOT WANT TO LIVE WITH. ON SUNDAY SHE WOKE UP WITH A HEADACHE. AND SHE SAID OKAY I'M READY. BUT THE NIGHT BEFORE SHE HAD ONE BITE OF KRAFT MAC AND CHEESE. HAD DARIEN IT'S THERE WAS CONCERN ON HER PART. ABOUT ABSORPTION THOUGH THE MEDICATION THAT SHE WAS PRESCRIBED WAS ENOUGH TO BASICALLY PUT DOWN AN ELEPHANT IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN AN ISSUE THE SHE FOLLOWS THE RULES. WE DIDN'T WANT ANY. CONFUSION CAN COMPLICATIONS. AND SO. ON MONDAY MORNING AND PLANTED A ROSE FOR HER AND SHE HAD DONE FOR HER FRIEND JANICE. WHO HAD DIED THAT WAS IN HER BREAST CANCER SUPPORT GROUP FROM YEARS BEFORE. AND ON MONDAY. SHE TOOK THE MEDICATION. AND SHE DIED PEACEFULLY ASLEEP TWENTY THREE MINUTES LATER. THERE WAS NO MORE PAIN AND WE'RE SUFFERING AND NO MORE NO ONE IS MORE GRATEFUL THAN I AND MY FATHER ARE TO NOTE THAT SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO SUFFER THE LAST DAYS OF INDIGNITY THE CANCER WAS ALREADY BRINGING. SHE GOT TO CHOOSE AND WE GOT TO FILL THE PROMISE WE MADE THE DAY SHE WAS DIAGNOSED. WELL I'M GLAD SHE WAS ABLE TO USE MEDICAL AID IN DYING AND EVER GRATEFUL FOR THE SYSTEM THAT SUPPORTS IT. IN INDIVIDUALS WHO SUPPORTED AND EVERYBODY WHO'S WORKED FOR AND CONTINUES TO WORK. FOR IT NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO ENTER ADDITIONAL DISTRUSTS BECAUSE OF BURDENSOME REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. MY FATHER. HE WANTED TO BE HERE TODAY BUT HE TOOK MY KIDS TO THE BUS STOP INSTEAD THIS MORNING. IS A TWO TIME PROSTATE CANCER SURVIVOR HE HAD MALIGNANT MELANOMA. THE WHICH MY BROTHER DIED FROM. AND HE'S HAD PUPS IN THIS COLON. IN WHICH HE DOESN'T DO THE COLONOSCOPY IS ANYMORE. I PRAY THAT HE SHOULD RECEIVE TERMINAL NEWS. WHICH WITH OUR FAMILY HISTORY IS QUITE LIKELY. HE WON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH ALL MY MOTHER WENT THROUGH. THANK YOU ALL FOR EVERYTHING YOU'RE DOING SUPPORT MEDICAL IN DYING. AND FOR LISTENING TO MY MOTHER'S STORY. SHE MAKE YOU ROSCOE. DIVERSE THE ROSCOE NEW IT SHOULD SO I LOVE CHICKENS LIMITS AGGRESSIVELY TO THE HOUSE NEXT DOOR SHE MADE ROCK RIPPER REPORTS ARE HOUSE ROSS REPORT RAPPER YEAH SHE WAS A QUILTER. AND LOVELY AND SHE GARDENS AND I HAVE HANDS ON MY WALLS IN THE KITCHEN ALSO BUT THIS REALLY SPEAKS TO HER SPIRIT. THANK YOU THANK YOU. CHEN THIS IS TOUGH GAME THE LAST ONE FOR THE WHOLE DAY BUT GIVE IT A GO SO GOOD MORNING- ASSEMBLY MEMBER EGGMAN AND OTHER COUNCIL MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING TO TELL MY STORY AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR EFFORTS AND GETTING THIS LAW PASSED MY NAME IS SHARON FELLS MY HUSBAND LERI BILLS PASSED AWAY ON JANUARY SEVENTEENTH TWENTY NINETEEN AFTER TAKING THE END OF LIFE MEDICATION. LARRY WAS ONLY FORTY NINE YEARS OLD WHEN HE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH STAGE FOUR BELL CANCER. THE PROGNOSIS WAS NOT GOOD AND THE DOCTORS GAVE HIM ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF TO LIVE. WE'RE LIVING IN AUSTRALIA AT THE TIME. OF FOR LARRY'S WORK SO WHERE ARE YOU AFTER GETTING THE NEWS DECIDED WE SHOULD TAKE HIS TAKE EARLY RETIREMENT MOVE BACK TO SACRAMENTO. WHERE WE HAD MANY FRIENDS AND DEEP ROOTS ESTABLISHED HERE ALSO HOPEFUL THAT THERE MIGHT BE OTHER OPTIONS OF WHAT TREATMENT WISE HERE IN THE US. SO ON JUNE TWENTY FOUR. WE ARRIVE BACK IN SOUTH. OUR CLOSELY FOLLOWING THE MEDICAL AID IN DYING ACT. A LEARN I DISCUSS THIS OPTION AND WE'RE BOTH VERY STRONG ADVOCATES FOR THE BILL. FOR THE NEXT THREE YEARS LARGELY TOLERATED HIS CHEMO RELATIVELY WELL WE'RE ABLE TO ENJOY THE THINGS THEY LOVE MOST TRAVEL GOLF GOOD FOOD AND GOOD WINE. EVERY TIME IS ON CALL DISARM IT SAY YOU LOOK LIKE JUST WALKED OFF THE GOLF COURSE HE NEVER LOST WEIGHT NEVER LOST HIS HAIR YOU ALWAYS LOOK THE OPTIMAL IN HEALTH. UNFORTUNATELY IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN SEPTEMBER A COLONOSCOPY REVEALED A SURGEON GROWTH OF THE TUMORS. SAID THIS MEANT THE CHEMO REGIME WAS NO LONGER WORKING AND YOU HAVE TO GO TO THE STRONGER TREATMENT PLAN- HE'S GOING TO GIVE IT A TRY HE WAS ADAMANT HE DID NOT WANT TO SUFFER. HORRIFIC SIDE EFFECTS JUST TO PROLONG HIS LIFE HIS MANTRA WAS ALWAYS QUALITY OF LIFE OVER QUANTITY OF LIFE. EARLY ON THERE MADE VERY TO ME AMAZON CALL TO. YOU TO IT. BUT PRIORITIES ORAL A LIFE YOU COULD. HE DID NOT WANT TO BE INCOME PAIN OR TO A TWO WAS. THAT MAKE IMPACT THE FIVE. AT THIS POINT MEDICALLY UNTIMELY PASS. AT MERRY NEW WOULD WANT THIS OP SHOULD THE TIME. HE'S ON COLLEGE EXPLAINED THE- AND IT TO NOT A PER. BUT HE WOULD BE ABLE TO REFER DOCTOR TO A PARTICIPATING DOCTOR. SO IN THE FALL TWENTY SEVENTEEN MARKETS ARE THE NEW ROUND OF STRONGER CHEMO. HOWEVER WITHIN A FEW MONTHS THE SIDE EFFECTS WERE BECOMING UNBEARABLE. SO IN MAY HE DECIDED TO STOP ALL FURTHER TREATMENTS. A FEW MONTHS LATER THE BLOOD WORK WAS SHOWING THE SIGNS THAT THE DISEASE IS PROGRESSING. THE ON CALL JUST CONFIRMED HE HAD ABOUT SIX MONTHS SO IN AUGUST WE STARTED THE PROCESS OF THE MEDICAL AID IN DYING SAID. WE MET WITH THE FIRST DOCTOR WHO CONFIRMED HER HIS PROGNOSIS WITH AND MET WITH THE SECOND DOCTOR A FEW WEEKS LATER WE ARE READY TO SCHEDULE THAT THIRD EMPLOYMENT ONE OUT OF THE BLUE WE GOT A CALL FROM HIS ONCOLOGIST. ADVISING US OF BRANDY CLINICAL TRIAL FOR BELL CANCER IN MY ROOM BE A PERFECT CANDIDATE SO ALL OF A SUDDEN WE HAD NEW HOPE. AND THIS IS WHAT WE'VE BEEN WAITING. SO THANKS TO GET STARTED. SO THE CLINICAL TRIAL BEGAN THE END OF OCTOBER. AND ALL WAS GOING WELL EXCEPT FOR PERSISTENT COUGH THAT HE DEVELOPED. AND THEN HE DEVELOPED EXPO- EXCRUCIATING PAIN SOON AFTER. IT TURNS OUT A FISTULA OR OPENING HAD FORMS IN HIS COLON WHICH ACOSTA SERIOUS INFECTION. AND THEN THERE WAS REMOVED FROM THE CLINICAL TRIAL SO ALL HOPE WAS STASHED. AT THIS POINT WE HADN'T EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT RESCHEDULING THAT THIRD AND FINAL DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT BECAUSE WE DIDN'T FEEL WE ARE IN THE IMMINENT DANGER. UNFORTUNATELY A COUPLE WEEKS GO BY IN THE PAIN CONTINUES TO WORSEN AND ON CHRISTMAS DAY I TOOK HIM TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM. THE OUR DOCTOR TOLD DISINFECTED FISTULA HAD NOW TURNED INTO A FLESH EATING BACTERIA. THAT WOULD RAVAGE HIS BODY WITHIN THREE DAYS HE WAS ADMITTED INTO THE HOSPITAL AND GIVEN MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF PAIN THAT'S TO KEEP THEM COMFORTABLE. ON DECEMBER TWENTY EIGHT HE WAS SENT HOME UNDER HOSPICE CARE. AT THIS POINT HE WAS ON SOME MEDICATION HE WAS UNCONSCIOUS. BEFORE WE LEFT THE HOSPITAL I FRANTICALLY CALLED THE MEDICAL AID IN THE HUNT DOCTOR TO SEE IF I CAN GET HIM IN FOR THAT ONE LAST APPOINTMENT. AND THE DOCTOR SAID HE WOULD HAVE TO COME TO HIS OFFICE. AND HE WOULD ALSO HAVE TO BE MENTALLY CAPABLE TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS. AT THAT POINT WHERE WAS NOT AWAKE NOR ABLE TO EVEN GET TO THE OFFICE SO. AGAIN WE- THOUGHT WE WERE. WE WERE OUT OF LUCK. BECAUSE OF WARY SIGNIFICANT MEDICAL NEEDS HOSPICE NURSES AND HOSPICE- HOME HEALTH CARE WAS COMING OUT TWICE A DAY. EXCUSE ME HE REMAIN MOSTLY UNCONSCIOUS FOR NEW YEAR'S EVE YOU START TO WAKE UP AND STARTED TALKING TO IS NO EXPLANATION FOR IT OTHER THAN HIS BODY WAS SO YOUNG AND STRONG AND NOT READY TO GIVE UP BY JANUARY SEVENTH HE WAS TALKING IS TAKING LESS LESS PAIN MEDS. WAS WAKING UP. AS HE CONTINUED TO MAKE SMALL IMPROVEMENTS. WE DISCUSS THE OPTION OF GETTING HIM TO SEE THE DOCTOR FOR THE THIRD AND FINAL VISIT LARRY WAS DETERMINED TO MAKE THAT APPOINTMENT SOMEONE JANUARY FOURTEENTH I SCHEDULED THE APPOINTMENT FOR TWO DAYS LATER. IT'S A GOOD TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF EFFORT TO GET HIM INTO THE CAR AND DRIVING THE THIRTY MINUTES TO THE OFFICE AND BECAUSE WE NEEDED LARRY TO BE AWAKE AND AWARE WE HAD TO LIMITS PAVEMENTS THAT MORNING SO HERE HE IS SITTING IN THE CHAIR COULD BARELY SET. EXCRUCIATING PAIN AND THAT'S TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS TO THE DOCTOR SATISFACTION. I WAS SO WORRIED HE WOULDN'T MAKE IT THROUGH ONLY BE DENIED THE PRESCRIPTION. THANKFULLY THE DOCTOR SAID IT WAS HE WAS FINE AND WE GOT THE MEDICATION. PRESCRIBED AND I WAS ABLE TO PICK IT UP THE NEXT DAY. THE COST WAS SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS. AND THAT WAS NOT COVERED BY ANY INSURANCE. I CALLED HOSPICE TO TELL WARY SELDOM WHERE WE'LL BE TAKING THE MEDICATION ON THE THURSDAY THE SEVENTEENTH. THEN FOR ME NO ONE FROM HOSPICE COULD BE THERE AND THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED TO BE INVOLVED IN THE PROCESS AT ALL. SOMEONE JANUARY SEVENTEENTH I PICKED UP THE MEDICATION. WHICH REQUIRED ME TO BE AWAY FOR THE LAST FEW PRECIOUS HOURS OF HIS LIFE. ALTHOUGH IN THE END I WAS ABLE TO GRANDSON IS FINAL WAS DYING OF HIS TERMS. IT WAS MUCH MORE STRESSFUL THAN IT REALLY NEED TO BE. BUT LASES SUFFERING WAS OVER. IN RETROSPECT I WAS DISAPPOINTED WITH THE LACK OF SUPPORT AND INFORMATION I RECEIVED. FROM BOTH UC DAVIS HAS SUCH A HOSPICE. IF ONLY I'D KNOWN MORE ABOUT THE LAW AND THE REQUIREMENTS. I WITH THE PROCESS COULD HAVE MADE A LOT EASIER. INSTEAD I RELIED ON THE INFORMATION I WAS GIVEN BY. THE DOCTORS AT UC DAVIS WHICH WAS WHAT THE TO. PROTOCOLS SO MY HEART THANKS GOOD EACH IN THE- OF YOU FOR. TAKING THIS ALL POSSIBLE I HOPE WE CAN CONTINUE TO KEEP IT ON THE BOOKS BEHIND TWENTY SIX TWENTY TWENTY SIX. AND ALSO MAKE FURTHER ENHANCEMENTS THANK YOU FOR ALL OF ME TO SHARE MY STORY. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU TO EVERYBODY WHO. WHO WHO WILL COME AND SHARE YOUR STORY AND YOU KNOW. THERE'S I DON'T HAVE WORDS RIGHT WITH RESPECT YOU IF WE FEEL YOUR PAIN WE YOU KNOW WE HAVE ALL LOST SOMEBODY AND HAVE HAVE TRAVERSE THIS JOURNEY THAT YOU NOW KNOW IS. SACRED AND FULL OF HILLS AND THINGS THAT YOU DON'T EXPECT- AND REALLY CALLS ON A SIGNATURE THINK AS HUMAN BEINGS TENDING TO A PART THAT WE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW EXISTED. TO BE ABLE TO GET THROUGH THE SOUTH THANK YOU FOR LOVING FAMILIES THANK YOU FOR COMING HERE IS TODAY TO SHARE STORIES. AND MY COMMITMENT FOR THE DRAG ME ON HERE ALL YOU KNOW HOW TO MY BEST TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE'VE UNCOVERED. AND TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS DOESN'T GO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. WE'RE GONNA HAVE TIME FOR SOME PUBLIC COMMENTS AND I SEE MR DAN TIAS IN THE HADITH LIKE. ART IF YOU AND IF YOU WANT TO SAY ANYTHING. HAS BEEN PEOPLE RECALL BURNING MAN AND THEN THE RIGHT THERE I THINK AT THE. BUT TURNOUT YES OKAY. SO MY NAME IS DAN DEUS. BERNARD WAS MY WIFE I HAVE A FEW ITEMS ARE PREPARED BUT JUST BECAUSE IT'S COME UP SO MANY TIMES- I FIGURED I'D SURE THE FOLLOWING REGARDING THE FIFTEEN DAY WAITING PERIOD- BECAUSE- OF OVER THE YEARS OF COURSE HAVE HAD COUNTLESS PEOPLE WHO APPROACH ME. IN CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS OTHER STATES- FOR STARTERS EVEN THAT TERM FIFTY DAY FIFTEEN DAY WAITING PERIOD. WAITING WAITING FOR WHAT. IT IT SUGGESTS THAT THE PATIENT NEEDS TIME TO COOL DOWN OR THAT THEY'RE MAKING AN IRRATIONAL OR IMPULSIVE DECISION AT AND LET ME BE CLEAR ABOUT THIS BRITNEY BEGAN THINKING ABOUT HER PATH FORWARD THE MINUTE THAT WE DISCOVER THAT BRAIN TUMOR AND THAT WAS MONTHS BEFORE SHE WOULD NEED TO APPLY FOR MEDICAL AID IN DYING. ALSO WHAT WE ARE ASKING THE PATIENT TO WAIT FIFTEEN DAYS. THE CANCER DOESN'T PAUSE FOR THOSE TWO WEEKS DOES IT. THAT BRAIN TUMOR BERNICE GOAL. IT'S NOT SAYING- WERE ON A WAITING PERIOD FOR FIFTEEN DAYS THERE FOR THE CANCER CELLS ARE SIMPLY GOING TO AGREE TO STOP MULTIPLYING FOR THAT PERIOD OF TIME. THAT'S NOT THE WAY THAT WORKS. BRITNEY'S GOAL JUST LIKE THE HUNDREDS OF TERMINALLY ILL INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE APPROACHED ME OVER THE YEARS. IS TO LIVE AS LONG AS POSSIBLE SO A TERMINALLY ILL INDIVIDUAL DOESN'T NEED FIFTEEN DAYS TO PROCESS THE REALITY. OF HOW THEIR DISEASE WILL AND THEIR LIFE. THE FAMILY MIGHT. SO ALL PUT THAT IN THERE THE FAMILY OF COURSE THEY THEY WANT THIRTY DAYS IF THEY COULD GET A THEY WANT THIRTY YEARS WITH THEIR LOVED ONE. BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT THE FIFTEEN DAYS IS TALKING ABOUT THIS WAITING PERIOD THE PATIENTS. EVERY PATIENT I'VE MET THEIR NAVIGATING WITH THIS WITH OUR EYES WIDE OPEN AND SO THE FIFTEEN DAY PERIOD IS RATHER OWNERS- AND ONLY BECAUSE CENTER MONNING HEAD HAD BROUGHT IT UP I JUST WANTED TO- ANSWER A QUESTION REGARDING THE VA- AND THIS WAS AN EXPERIENCE PERSONAL EXPERIENCES WAS A KID THAT I'VE KNOWN SINCE WERE FIVE YEARS OLD. HIS NAME IS JOHN BISSINGER. HE WAS IN THE ARMY. AND HE WAS RECEIVING HIS CARE THROUGH THE VA. LIVE IN CALIFORNIA DOWN SAN DIEGO AND WHEN HE BROUGHT UP THE TOPIC OF MEDICAL AID IN DYING LIKELY BECAUSE HE HAD A VERY GOOD. RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS PHYSICIAN HE WAS TERMINALLY ILL WOULD QUALIFY FOR THIS YET A CHRONIC DISEASE THAT SPANNED NEARLY TWO DECADES- HIS PHYSICIAN SAID THAT HE WOULD ALLOW THAT CONVERSATION JUST THAT ONE TIME. BUT BEYOND THAT IF YOUNG WAS TO BRING IT UP AGAIN- YOUNG TOLD ME THAT WHAT HIS OF PHYSICIAN SAID IS THAT THE PROTOCOL FOR THE VA IS THAT HE WOULD THEN HAVE TO PUT HIM IN A- A PSYCHIATRIC EVALUATION. BECAUSE HE'S ESSENTIALLY GOING AGAINST THE POLICY SO IT'S JUST AN EXAMPLE OF WHERE POLICY AND PROCESS OF THE VA IN THIS CASE IS GETTING IN THE WAY OF PATIENT CARE- AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WHEN I'VE BEEN IN DC WORKING ON AND I KNOW THAT'S A FEDERAL ISSUE IT'S NOTHING THAT WE CAN CONTROL HERE IN THE STATE BUT- IT IS JUST A MATTER OF TRAINING FOR- THE MEN AND WOMEN IN. UNIFORM THAT RECEIVE THEIR CARE- FROM THE VA- THAT IT IS HANDLED IN A- IN A WAY THAT. DOESN'T YEAH. CAST THOSE PEOPLE WHO WERE ASKING FOR A RIGHT THAT IS LEGAL IN THE STATE AND A SENSE OF SHAME THEM JUST FOR ASKING SO. THANKS I JUST WANTED SURE THOSE TWO ITEMS BECAUSE THERE WERE PERTINENT TO THE ONES WHO WERE BROUGHT UP AND I'LL BE QUICK ON MY PREPARED REMARKS- SO YES BRITNEY BRITNEY IS CASE RECEIVED. A LOT OF ATTENTION- SHE DIED FIVE YEARS AGO- BECAUSE WE HAD TO LEAVE OUR HOME HERE IN CALIFORNIA DRIVE TO OREGON. SO SHE WOULD HAVE THE OPTION OF THIS OF A GENTLE DYING PROCESS. SHE WAS ALSO ONLY TWENTY NINE YEARS OLD. THE REASON BERNIE SPOKE UP WAS BECAUSE SHE WAS FIGHTING FOR TERMINALLY ILL INDIVIDUALS THAT MAY NOT HAVE A VOICE. SHE SPOKE UP SO THAT NO ONE ELSE IN CALIFORNIA SPECIFICALLY BUT IN ANY STATE. WHATEVER HAVE TO LEAVE THEIR HOME AFTER BEING TOLD YOU HAVE SIX MONTHS TO LIVE. REGARDING THAT EXPERIENCE USER BRITNEY'S WORDS SHE WOULD SAY. HAVING TO LEAVE OUR HOME THIS IS SUCH A HUGE AND JUSTICE. AND A MONUMENTAL WASTE OF TIME. IT WAS TIME OF COURSE THAT BRITNEY DIDN'T REALLY HAVE TO SPARE. BUT NOW WITH GREAT PRIDE IN THE IMPACT THAT HER STORY HAS MADE- MY TESTIMONY TODAY OR WHAT I'M SHARING IT MIRRORS OF THE TESTIMONY THAT I PROVIDED AT THE LAST SELECT COMMITTEE COMMITTEE HEARING. BUT NOW THOSE WORDS ARE AMPLIFIED BECAUSE TWO MORE YEARS OF PASSED. I CONTINUE TO HAVE COUNTLESS TERMINALLY ILL INDIVIDUALS AND THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS SHARE WITH ME. HOW GRATEFUL THEY ARE TO HAVE THIS OPTION IN CALIFORNIA. ADDITIONALLY WHAT THEY SHARE IS THAT THEY WISH THE PROCESS WOULD RUN SMOOTHER WE FOR SOME CASES OF WORD HAS GONE WELL KAISER NOR CAL SEEMS TO DO A REALLY GOOD JOB AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS WHERE IT'S NOT. THEY WISH OUR NEIGHBORING OR THEIR LOCAL MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS WOULD MAKE THIS OPTION AVAILABLE TO THEIR PATIENTS AND PHYSICIANS ALIKE. AND THAT THE CHURCH AND OTHER RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS WOULD STOP TRYING TO IMPOSE THEIR NARROW BELIEF SYSTEM ON TO THE REST OF SOCIETY. SPECIFICALLY THAT REGULARLY SHOULD THE NEED TO SHORTEN THE FIFTEEN DAY WAITING PERIOD SHORTENED DOWN TO SOMETHING MAYBE LESS THAN FIVE DAYS. IN THEIR WISDOM THESE TERMINALLY ILL PATIENTS HAVE ACCURATELY DECIPHERED. BUT THE FIFTEEN DAY WAITING PERIOD IS VERY LIKELY A POLITICAL COMPROMISE OF SORTS. INSTEAD OF ANYTHING THAT ACTUALLY BENEFITS THE PATIENT. THEY REITERATE THE SENSE OF SALAS AND RELIEF A TWO BY SIMPLY HAVING QUALIFY FOR THE PROGRAM. AND THE USUALLY FOLLOWED UP. WITH A COMMENT STATING THEIR HOPE THAT THEY'LL NEVER NEED TO UTILIZE THE MEDICATION. THEY'RE GLAD TO SEE THE CULTURAL CHANGES WHICH ARE SLOWLY TAKING PLACE THE SIMPLE RECOGNITION OF OUR COLLECTIVE HUMANITY AND MORTALITY. THE SIMPLE RECOGNITION THAT LIFE ALL LIFE EVENTUALLY COMES TO AN END AND THAT ENDINGS MATTER. LISTENING LISTEN TO THE INDIVIDUALS TESTIFY HERE TODAY. I FEEL A GREAT SENSE OF PRIDE IN BRITNEY'S. ADVOCACY AND LEGACY I LOOK BACK AT THE LAST FEW WEEKS OF HER LIFE AND I MARVEL AT HER DETERMINATION TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE FOR THE REST OF US EVEN IF SHE WAS NAVIGATING HER OWN TIME PROCESS DURING THAT TIME. IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN. LASTLY WHEN SHE THAT THERE WERE ONLY FOUR STATES WITH THIS OPTION NOW THERE ARE TEN- I'VE SPOKEN AT PALLIATIVE CARE CONFERENCES- TO SHARE WITH THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY TO MAKE THE MORE FAMILIAR WITH THE REALITY IN SAFE PART OF THIS PROGRAM I'VE SHARED HER MESSAGE OF HOPE AND LIVING WITH ADD BIOETHICS CONFERENCES UNIVERSITIES HIGH SCHOOLS AND EVEN TO EIGHTH GRADE CLASSROOMS OF BEEN FOURTEEN DIFFERENT STATE CAPITALS. THIS IS HOW I KEEP MY PROMISE TO HER- AND REGARDS TO THE EDUCATION SIDE OF THINGS FOR PHYSICIANS BRITAIN IS NOW IN THREE TEXT BOOKS. AND A COUPLE OF ONLINE COURSES AS WELL. I'M STILL WORKING ON THE AMA ANOTHER MEDICAL GROUPS TO ADOPT A POSITION OF SUPPORT OR AT THE VERY LEAST NEUTRALITY BECAUSE I KNOW THAT WENT A LONG WAY FOR US HERE. IN CALIFORNIA WHEN THE CMA- TOOK THE POSITION OF NEUTRALITY AND SO STATE BY STATE- WORKING ON THAT AS WELL AS A NATIONAL ORGANIZATION SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR LETTING ME SHARE- ON. AN UPDATE ON EVERYTHING THAT SO WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THANKS THANK YOU VERY MUCH DAN. ANYBODY ELSE LIKE TO MAKE PUBLIC COMMENTS AT THIS TIME. IN MY- THANK YOU CHAIR. EKLUND AND TO THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THIS HEARING. AND FOR CONTINUING TO SUPPORT THOSE WHO ARE SUFFERING AND THEIR FAMILIES WHO SEEK TO END THEIR SUFFERING. I AM THE RIVER MADISON SHOCKLEY AND I AM THE PASTOR OF THE PILGRIM UNITED CHURCH OF CHRIST IN CARLSBAD CALIFORNIA. AS A MINISTER I SIT WITH PEOPLE AT THE END OF THEIR LIVES IN THEIR DYING DAYS. AND I'VE WATCHED HELPLESSLY AS TOO MANY TERMINALLY ILL CALIFORNIANS HAVE. NEEDLESSLY SUFFERED ALL DYING. SITTING WITH THE WIFE WATCHING HER HUSBAND SUFFOCATE. I WE'VE HEARD TO DATE WE ARE GRATEFUL GRATEFUL FOR YOU AND FOR THOSE WHO SUPPORTED AND BROUGHT THIS LAW TO CALIFORNIA BUT THE LAW IS STILL TOO DIFFICULT. TO ACCESS. AS A RELIGIOUS LEADER I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE HURDLES WE HAVE HEARD ABOUT TODAY. THE MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR DYING PEOPLE TO USE THIS COMPASSIONATE LAW TO DIE PEACEFULLY. I WANT TO ENCOURAGE YOU TO RECOGNIZE THE DIVERSITY OF SPIRITUAL BELIEFS AND PRACTICES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND IN THE UNITED STATES AND OF COURSE IN THE WORLD. THE FASTEST GROWING RELIGIOUS MOVEMENT IS SPIRITUAL BUT NOT RELIGIOUS. AND SO WHEN WE SPEAK OF PEOPLE OF FAITH. THAT F. IS NOT CAPITAL AND THE P. IS NOT CAPITAL THERE ARE MANY MANY PEOPLE OF MANY MANY FAKES. AS A MINISTER OF THE UNITED CHURCH OF CHRIST IN MY CONGREGATION NADA NOMINATION SUPPORT THIS LAW. WE ARE SO GLAD THAT WE ARE ABLE TO LIVE OUR FAITH. TO THE END OF OUR LIVES AND THOSE WHO WOULD DENY US THAT OPPORTUNITY. ARE DENYING US OUR FREEDOM OF RELIGION. AND SO WE NEED TO REMEMBER THAT AS WELL. THE ROAD BLOCK THESE ROADBLOCKS WE'VE HEARD ABOUT TODAY ONLY EXACERBATE THE LACK OF ACCESS FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR POOR PEOPLE AFRICAN AMERICANS LATINOS. WHO ALREADY SUFFER DISPARATE CARE IN OUR MEDICAL SYSTEMS. WHO ALREADY SUFFER LACK OF ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. AND THOSE OPTIONS AT THE END OF LIFE NEED TO BE AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE REGARDLESS OF THEIR SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS. RACE RELIGION. ETHNICITY NATIONALITY OR LANGUAGE. WE KNOW THAT AFRICAN AMERICANS LATINOS ACCESS HOSPICE AT A LOWER RATE THAN. WHY POPULATIONS AND THIS LEADS TO MANY OTHER COMPLICATIONS EIGHT LEAVE HOSPICE SOONER GO TO. HOSPITALS EMERGENCY ROOMS AND THIS GIVES THEM A VERY DIFFERENT DINING EXPERIENCE ONE WITH MORE UNNECESSARY TREATMENTS ONE WITH MORE UNNECESSARY PAIN. AND SO WE ASK THAT YOU CONTINUE TO. SUPPORT THIS LAW TO ENCOURAGE EVERYONE TO SHARE THE INFORMATION THAT'S VITAL FOR EVERYONE TO ACCESS THIS LAW TO KNOW THAT THEY CAN HAVE THE CHOICE. THAT THEY CAN BE EMPOWERED TO CHART THEIR OWN END OF LIFE JOURNEY. AND THAT. IT'S AVAILABLE FOR THEM. AND THAT THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO IT IF YOU NEED. SUPPORT IN SPREADING THAT WORD- COMPASSIONATE CHOICES ON WHOSE BOARD I'M PRIVILEGE TO SERVE. HI MY I MYSELF WILL BE GLAD TO GO TO YOUR DISTRICT OR TO WHEREVER PEOPLE NEED TO HEAR THE INFORMATION TO LET PEOPLE KNOW THE PEOPLE OF FAITH SUPPORT THIS LAW. AND THAT DYING PEOPLE DO NOT NEED TO DIE. IN EXCRUCIATING PAIN WHEN THERE IS A MEDICAL OPTION. IT'S CAUSED ME TO RETHINK THE WAY I DELIVER THE GOSPEL MESSAGE. YOU'VE BEEN TOO MANY FUNERALS AND THERE'S SOME STANDARD PASSAGES BUT- IN THE TEN YEARS FIFTEEN YEARS NOW I GUESS IT'S BEEN. THAT I'VE BEEN ACTIVE IN THIS MOVEMENT MY THEOLOGY HAS EVOLVED IN I HEAR THE WORDS DIFFERENTLY NOW IN THOSE FINAL WORDS AT THE GRAVESIDE WOULD BE STATE ST PAUL WHO SAYS DEATH. WHERE IS YOUR VICTORY. DEATH WISHES TO A- THROUGH THE END OF LIFE OPTION ACT. WE CAN TAKE THE STING AFTER DEATH ALLOW PEOPLE TO DIE PEACEFULLY. IN THE ARMS OF THEIR LOVED ONES THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
