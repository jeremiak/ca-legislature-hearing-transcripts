I ALSO WANTED TO LET FOLKS KNOW THAT IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE DOES NOT HAVE A FILE ON THIS BILL. AND WILL NOT BE PARTICIPATING TODAY SO COMMITTEE MEMBERS SHOULD KNOW THAT. AND THEN WE'LL TAKE THE DISCUSSION BACK TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS MANY MEMBERS HAVE A QUESTION OR COMMENT FOR THE AUTHOR. MISTER Y. CASKEY I WAS WONDERING I'M- SORRY TO FINANCES IN HERE DO WE KNOW IF. IF THE STATE HIGHWAY COUNTY EVER RECEIVED MONEY FROM THIS PASADENA EL SERENO AREA ON THE SALE OF SURPLUS PROPERTY AND IN THE PRESUMPTION WOULD BE. IF THEY'RE IF THEY'RE NOT GETTING ANY MONEY THEN YOU WOULDN'T BE AND THE RIBBON ROADS THAT COULD BE BUILT AND THERE'S NO NEED FOR THAT. RECYCLING OF THE MONEY FROM THIS X. THE SURPLUS SALE TO GO INTO THE- THE CONSTRUCTION SO I GUESS THAT'S MY QUESTION. I'M MISTRAS ROCKET FROM TAKE THAT YES MONEY DOES GO INTO THE ACCOUNT AND SOME OF THE AND THE CITIES WITHIN THE CORRIDOR. HAVE USE THAT MONEY AND PLAN TO USE THAT MONEY SO THAT COUNT IS ACTIVE RIGHT. RIGHT BUT JIM AND SUBSEQUENT SOME THERE WILL BE LOCAL ROAD IMPROVEMENTS AND LOCAL- PROJECTS THAT WILL BE FUNDED FROM THAT ACCOUNT NOT THE FREEWAY ITSELF IS DEAD BUT- OKAY LOCAL PROJECTS AND PRESENT. ASSEMBLY AT THE AT THE SALE OF THE LAST PROPERTY IN THE DISPEL THAT. THAT BY HAVING YOU OF FUNDS WILL STOP BECAUSE THERE WILL BE NO SURPLUS PROPERTY OR FEDERAL OFFICIALS RIGHT WRECKED- BUT ALSO MISTER ROGER FIVE MAY THE ONE POT I'M ANOTHER POSITIVE OF SELLING THE HOUSES. IS CURRENTLY THEY'RE NOT GENERATING LOCAL SALES TAX FOR THE COMMUNITY SO. LONG TERM ONCE THOSE PROPERTIES ARE IN PRIVATE HANDS WILL BE GENERATING SALES TAX TO FOUR. L. A. ALHAMBRA SOUTH PASS AND PASADENA YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FOR MISTER ROGERS YES MISTER JONES. THANK YOU SIR DRAWS I CERTAINLY SUPPORT GETTING CALTRANS OUT OF THE HOME OWNERSHIP AND RENTAL BUSINESS- WE HAD A SIMILAR SITUATION IN MY DISTRICT SEVERAL YEARS AGO AND- AS SOON AS THESE PROPERTIES WERE SOLD TO PRIVATE. PROPERTY THE NEIGHBORHOODS IMMEDIATELY. SO I DO HAVE SOME FISCAL CONCERNS- ONE OUR STAFF REACHED OUT TO CALTRANS TO TRY TO FIND. THE SALES PRICE OF THE DIFFERENT PROPERTIES AND- CALTRANS WAS UNABLE TO PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION. SO I'M I'M WONDERING YOU KNOW WHY. LET ME THEY NEED THEY SHOULD KNOW WHAT THE ORIGINAL SALES PRICE WAS AND IT WAS I AM PART OF MY CONCERN ON THAT IS YOU KNOW THESE ARE FIFTY YEAR OLD. PROPERTIES YOU KNOW IT'S VERY LIKELY THAT FIFTY YEARS AGO A SINGLE FAMILY HOME IN THIS AREA SOLD FOR YOU KNOW SIX TO TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. THAT TODAY WOULD BE WORTH. AND I'M GUESSING I'M NOT THAT FAMILIAR WITH IT YOU KNOW AT LEAST THE MEDIAN PRICE AROUND SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND. SO WHY NOT. WHY NOT GET THE- APPRAISAL AND SELL IT AT MARKET RATE. IF I CAN- BASICALLY THEY WILL BE SOLD AT EITHER MARKET OR- AFFORDABLE- EXCEPT FOR THE HOUSING ENTITIES OR THE LOCAL YOU KNOW CITY OR COUNTY IF THEY WANT TO COMMIT TO THE GUARANTEE OF LONG TERM AFFORDABILITY FIFTY FIVE YEARS THOSE ARE THE ONES WHO ARE GOING TO GET IT OUT TO REGIONAL ACQUISITION PRICE SO IT'S A IT'S A GIVE AND TAKE. THEY'LL BE ABLE TO GET IT AT A MUCH REDUCED RATE BECAUSE LAND IS SO EXPENSIVE AND PRODUCING AFFORDABLE HOUSING SO THEY'LL GET IT AT THE ORIGINAL ACQUISITION AND THEN THEY'LL BE ABLE TO INVEST TO REPAIR THE REMODEL THEM AND MAKE THEM LONG TERM AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IT'S IN THE ORIGINAL ACQUISITION PRICES NOT FOR THE INDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNERS IS GOING TO BE A GUARANTEE OF- THIS LONG TERM AFFORDABILITY SO IF I UNDERSTAND YOUR ANSWERS ON THE SINGLE FAMILY HOMES IT WILL BE SOLD FOR MARKET YOU STILL BE SOLD AT A MARKET RATE. WELL EITHER MARKET OR FOR DOUBLE DEPENDING ON THE TENANT AND OKAY AND THERE LOW INCOME YES IF YOU WANT ME TO ADD A LITTLE BIT- SO THERE'S A WHOLE OUTLINE OF PRIORITIES AND ELIGIBILITY FOR THE LONG TERM TENANTS WHO HAVE BEEN IN THERE FOR SOME OF THEM THIRTY PLUS YEARS- THERE'S ALL INCOME THRESHOLD. AND SO THOSE TENANTS WHO WILL BUY THEIR HOUSES AT LESS THAN AFFORDABLE RATE THE STATE WILL MAINTAIN AN INTEREST IN THE EQUITY- SO UNDER THE RIVER TO BILL AND UNDER A CALLALOO BILL THERE'S A WHOLE DEFINITION OF HOW THAT IS SPLIT. AND SO THE STATE CAN BE MADE WHOLE IN THOSE SO THE LONG STANDING TENANTS WHO MEET THE INCOME ELIGIBILITY CAN BITE AT LESS THAN MARKET RATE BUT THE STAFF AT WHICH TIME IT GETS SOLD THAT EQUITY PIECE TO BE THE DELTA BETWEEN MARKET RATE AND THE DISCOUNT RATE THE STATE STILL HAS THAT INTEREST. IN THAT- BACK FROM A CARE BILL THAT WAS PUT AND- ALSO THE RIVER HE BUILT. THE SEVENTIES. ALL OF THAT IS TO FIND- THE ONLY WAY THEY CAN DO THAT IS IF AND NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION CORRECT THAT'S WHAT MISTER ROGERS DOING IN HER VILLAGE AND IF THEY HAVE A COVENANT THAT THOSE. UNITS STAY AFFORDABLE FOR WHICH IT FIFTY YEARS FIFTY FIVE EIGHTY FIFTY FIVE YEARS OR SO THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT MISTER ROGERS DOING IN. HER DISTRICT VERSUS THE REST OF THE CORRIDORS JUST THAT ONE PIECE. ON THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING COMPONENT BUT WAS YOUR OFFICE ABLE TO GET ANY OF THOSE NUMBERS FROM CALTRANS THAT YOU COULD SHARE WITH THE REST OF US. AND ALSO IN ADDITION TO THAT HOW MANY ATMS ARE INVOLVED I MEAN. PIECES OF PROPERTY- PART OF THIS. WELL I KNOW THE NUMBER OF. PROPERTIES WE DIDN'T- WE CAN GET FOR YOU BEING. A PROPERTY PER PROPERTY WHAT THE- BY WOULD THAT THEY WOULD BE SOLD CALTRANS HAS AN EXCEL SPREADSHEET SOMEWHERE THAT SAYS A. P. N. NUMBER BLAH BLAH BLAH ORIGINALLY SOLD FOR EIGHTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS OR- OR WHATEVER I DON'T HAVE THAT HERE BUT OKAY. WE GET IT WE CAN I'M SURE BETWEEN MR ASO IN MY OFFICEWE COULD FIND THAT FOR YOU AND GET THAT TO YOU. I MEAN I THINK THAT WOULD BE GOOD INFORMATION FISCAL INFORMATION FOR THE- THIS COMMITTEE TO HAVE- THERE'S A THERE'S A TOTAL OF TWO HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR OF PROPERTIES IN THE EL SERENO LOS ANGELES AREA IT'S A MIX OF OCCUPIED SINGLE AND MULTI FAMILY AND UNOCCUPIED IT IS UNBELIEVABLE TO ME THAT WE HAVE A HUNDRED. VACANT HOMES IN LA- I MEAN THAT IS JUST A CRIME I DON'T SEE CRIMINAL THAT ALMOST CRIMINAL- SO I'M GONNA LAY OFF THE BILL TODAY AND GET THOSE ANSWERS BUT HOPEFULLY I- MILIK CITED LEAKS SUPPORTED ON THE FLOOR. WELL SOME PEOPLE LIKE CARTER HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS FOR MANY MANY MANY YEARS DECADES AND DECADES SO WE'RE GLAD- THAT WE'RE FINALLY ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH WITH THESE PROPERTIES YEAH I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THE DOLLARS AND SENSE MAKES SENSE. FOR OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. MISTER BRADFORD YEAH I TO HAVE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED BY THOSE CURRENT TENANT AND IF. THE GOAL IS TO KEEP FOLKS HOLLISTER I AM REALLY I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE LEVEL OPPOSITION TO THOSE FOLKS WHO STATE THAT THEY HAVE BEEN THERE FOR TWENTY PLUS IS SOME STATED THIRTY TWO YEARS AND THESE PROPERTIES AND IF THIS IS SUCH A GREAT IDEA WHY DOES IT NOT AFFECT ENTIRE CORRIDOR THAT THE CALTRANS ONLY'S PROPERTIES FOR. OVER PROBABLY FIFTY YEARS SHOWN JUST CURIOUS ABOUT THAT AND- JUST HOW ARE THOSE TENANTS RIGHT NOW WHO WERE THERE AND- GOING TO BE PROTECTED AT. I'M SORRY I THINK I THINK I HEARD TWO TWO QUESTIONS ONE IS- THE CURRENT TENANTS. TO RENO. BUT THE CONDITIONS AND THE ON THE NEEDS I THINK ARE PARTICULARLY DIFFERENT IN THE L. SERENO AREA FROM PASADENA AND SOUTH PASADENA ALSO. WELL FOR SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENCE MORE HISTORIC THORTON IS HIS STORY HOMES THERE'S A LOT LESS OF PROPERTIES IT'S JUST TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES IN THE REST OF THE CORRIDOR PASADENA SOUTH PASADENA IS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM. THE WAY THE WHOLE THE HOUSING IN THE OTHER IN EL SERENO AND ALLEY CITY PARK SO WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BEST IF WE- ARE FOCUSED ON WHAT THE NEEDS HAVE BEEN. A LOT MORE ON OCCUPIED A LOT MORE HOT HOUSING THAT NEEDS WORK- AND SO ALL THOSE DIFFERENT CONDITIONS THAT IS TO THINK THIS IS BETTER TO FOCUS BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE MAJOR ISSUES HAVE BEEN IS IN THE EL SERENO PART OF THE CORRIDOR. WE REALLY WANT TO FOCUS IN TWO MOVIES PROPERTIES FORWARD AND THERE AGAIN- THE CHAIRS AS REPRESENTATIVE OF THAT AREA. KNOWS THAT THERE ARE DISTINCTIONS THAT WE WANT TO MAKE IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO MOE FORWARD WITH AFFORDABILITY AND ALSO SELLING IT TO THE CURRENT TENANTS SO THE CURRENT TENANTS WILL BE ABLE TO BUY IF THEY WANT IF THEY DON'T WANT. YOU'LL STAY THERE NOT GOING TO BE EVICTED ON YOU KNOW THERE'S INCOME LEVELS ARE THAT HAVE TO BE MET OF FOR AFFORDABILITY I THINK IT WAS YOU- CENTER PORTANTINO THAT. MAKE SURE THAT WE HAD THE AFFORDABLE RENTERS PROGRAM THAT WAS EXTENDED THERE BECAUSE THERE WAS A SUNSET ON IT. SO WE'RE TRYING TO DO EVERYTHING ONE IS TO SUPPORT OUR HOMEOWNERSHIP IN THIS COMMUNITY THOSE WHO ARE TENANTS AND STAY THERE AND BUY THEM IF THEY WISH. IF THEY CAN'T OR- AND FOR THOSE BACON PROPERTIES LET'S AND DOES A AND- LET'S PUT THE INTO THE HANDS OF. YOU KNOW PROFESSIONAL OF A PROFESSIONAL HOUSING DEVELOPERS- ENTITIES THAT KNOW HOW TO BRING IT UP TO PAR AND THEN THEY CAN. MAKE THIS LONG TERM AFFORDABLE HOUSING M. MR FOR ME I'M JUST OVER HERE MISTER BRADFORD THERE IS A PROCESS IN PLACE. FOR SELLING THE HOUSES THAT RESPECTS THE INCOME. LEVELS OF THE LONG STANDING TENANTS SO JUST BECAUSE THIS BILLS SPECIFIC EL SERENO DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE OTHER PARTS OF THE DISTRICT AREN'T GOVERNED BY PRIOR LEGISLATION INDISPOSITION AND CALTRANS. THOUGH NOT MOVING AS FAST AS ANYBODY WOULD LIKE IS SELLING THOSE HOMES ACCORDING TO THAT- PRIOR LEGISLATION. AND SO- THAT THAT I MEAN THAT'S JUST FACTUAL IN IN HOW YOU KNOW IT'S BEING DONE AND AS I EXPLAINED MISTER JONES. THOSE LONGSTANDING TENDED TO GET TO BUY IT AT A DISCOUNTED RATE THERE'S PROVISIONS BOTH TO PROTECT THOSE TENANTS IF THEY'RE IN THE FORM OF A HOUSING PROGRAM AS WELL AS THE STATE'S. INTEREST IN THOSE PROJECTS BUT WOOD MISTER ROGERS DOING IN HER SECOND. SECTION IS TWEAKING THAT SLIGHTLY IN RELATION TO THE TO THE NON PROFITS THAT'S THE DIFFERENT COMPONENT BETWEEN THE REST OF THE DISTRICT. AND THE EL SERENO PEACE AND SO. THAT THAT'S THE- THAT'S THE MAJOR DIFFERENCE. BUT THE OTHER STILL IS GOVERNED ALL OF THE- ELIGIBILITY THE LONGSTANDING PROTECTIONS. AND THE PROCESSES THAT GO BACK TO DAVID ROBERTI AND THEN WORKED WEEK PROBABLY SIX TIMES SINCE THEN THE OTHER THING THAT'S GOING ON IS CALTRANS. I BELIEVE WE'RE STILL WAITING FOR THE OVERALL REGULATIONS THAT THEY'RE SUPPOSEDTO DRAFT BASED ON THAT LEGISLATION AND SO. THAT'S PART OF WHAT. THE AMOUNT OF MY DISTRICT WANTS TO SEE WHAT THOSE REGULATIONS ARE BEFORE WE GO DOWN CHANGING ANY OF THE PROCESSES THAT HAVE BEEN IN PLACE SINCE THE LATE SEVENTIES AND TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION SINCE THEN. BUT MISTER ROGER HAS A UNIQUE SITUATION IN HER DISTRICT THAT SHE'S SHE'S DOING AND SO I'LL MAKE MY COMMENT IF I MAY MISAPPROPRIATE STRUCTURE MR. I MOVE THE BILL WE HAVE A MOTION ON THE BILL. MISTER ROGERS I'M GONNA GO TO YOUR CLOTHES BUT I JUST WANT TO SAY REAL QUICK- YOU KNOW I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A PROPONENT THAT YOU KNOW SENATORS AND ASSEMBLY MEMBERS YOU KNOW. DEALING WITH THEIR OWN DISTRICT ISSUES SHOULD BE GIVEN DEFERENCE TO IT TO ME IT'S THE WAY THIS HOUSE USED TO FUNCTION. IN IN THE OLDEN DAYS SO I APPRECIATE YOU RESPECTING THAT PROCESS THIS IS A DISTRICT TO ME THIS IS A DISTRICT SPECIFIC BILL AND SO THAT'S WHY I'M GIVING DIFFERENCE TO IT AND- EXPECTED WHEN IT COMES BACK TO STAY THAT WAY- AND AGAIN AS I JUST EXPLAINED YOU KNOW THE ALHAMBRA WE ALSO HAVE TO RESPECT HIS RUBIO HAMMERS PART BY PART. OF THE DISTRICT- HAVE A PROCESS IN PLACE AND WE WILL BE LOOKING AT THAT AS IT UNFOLDED WHEN THOSE REGULATIONS COME OUT FROM CALTRANS AND SO WE'LL SEE HOW WE CAN IMPROVE. ON THAT IN IN MY PART OF THE DISTRICT AND SO WITH THAT IF YOU'D LIKE TO MAKE A BRIEF CLOSE. WILL TAKE ABOUT AFTER THAT. SO AGAIN- WE INTRODUCE AS BEFORE. ONE TO BRING MORE LONG TERM AFFORDABLE HOUSING TELL SERENO AND DEVELOP THIS LONG TERM SOLUTION. FOR THOSE RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES. AGAIN SOME OF THEM HAVE BEEN SITTING VACANT AND IN DISRESPECTFUL. AND YEARS. AND WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WORST HOUSING CRISIS IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY SO. WILL SECURE THE SALE OF THESE HOUSES TO LOW AND MODERATE INCOME TENANTS. OR CONVERT THEM INTO LONG TERM AFFORDABLE RENTERS. RENTALS IF THE TENANTS ARE NOT INTERESTED OR IF THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO BUY THE HOME. FACILITATE THE REPAIR OF THE EXISTING HOMES AND FINALLY. ALLOW CALTRANS TO GET OUT OF THE BUSINESS OF RENTING HOMES SOLD. THERE IS AN URGENT DEMAND FROM OUR COMMUNITY TO. SOLVE THIS- AND IT'S ABOUT GIVING ALSO DENTAL. THE LONG OVERDUE ATTENTION THAT THAT PARTICULAR COMMUNITY DESERVES THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH AND- I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU MISTER RAZA WITH THAT WE HAVE A MOTION TO DISPATCH REFERRED THE BILL TO THE SENATE FLOOR. SO MR SECRETARY WOULD YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THROUGH OUR- BILLERS SB FIFTY ONE THE MOTIONS TO PASS THE SENATE FLOOR SENATOR PORTANTINO HI PORTANTINO HI SENATOR BATES. ALL RIGHT- BATES BY. CENTER BRADFORD. SENATOR JONES.
