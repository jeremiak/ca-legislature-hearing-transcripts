I SEE THAT OUR CHANGE OF LOCATION DIDN'T. CONFUSE OR DISCOURAGE ANYONE FROM ATTENDING TODAY. SO THAT STRATEGY COMPLETELY FAILED. I'M IT IS GOOD CO ALL HERE THIS MORNING GUY AS WE BEGIN TO CLOSE OUT THE. BUDGET IN. SUBCOMMITTEE NUMBER THREE. SINCE WE DO NOT HAVE A QUORUM YET WE ARE GOING TO PASS OVER THE VOTE ONLY CALENDAR. WHICH IS A CONSIDERABLE PART OF OUR AGENDA TODAY. AND WE WILL TAKE OUR ONE ITEM TO BE HEARD THE COLOR CAL EPA'S SACRAMENTO HEADQUARTERS ISSUE. ISSUE NUMBER ONE. SO. YOU'D LIKE TO STEP FORWARD ON THAT. LET ME PRESENT TO. FEEL FREE TO TAKE ALL THE TIME YOU WANT AS WE WAIT FOR MEMBERS AND THEN WHEN YOU SEE A FULL FORM WHERE YOU CAN JUST. HI HI. WELCOME GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR IN ASSEMBLY MEMBER. ERIC JARVIS WITHOUT COUNTY PA. THINK WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU THIS MORNING. AYE THE AGENDA DESCRIBES OUR PROPOSAL ACCURATELY AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION. FOR PROOF IS BUDGETED. SO IN ADVANCE I I WILL BE BRIEF WITH MY COMMENTS OTHER THAN TO EMPHASIZE A CUE FEW KEY POINTS. THAT UNDERSCORE THE MERITS OF THE PROPOSAL. OUR IF IT'S NO SECRET OVER THE YEARS CAL EPA HAS GROWN RATHER SIGNIFICANTLY AND WE DON'T SEE THAT TREND CHANGING. IN THE NEAR FUTURE SO. WE HAVE IN OUR PROPOSAL. WE ADDRESS THE IMMEDIATE AND AND LONG STANDING. BUSINESS NEEDS OFFICE SPACE BUSINESS HE'S FOR ALL THE BOARDS DEPARTMENTS DEPARTMENTS AND OFFICES EXCUSE ME AND AND CAL EPA. AND AS WE SEE IT WE REALLY ONLY HAVE TWO OPTIONS MAXIMIZE OUR SPACE IN OUR CURRENT HEADQUARTERS BUILDING. OR SEEK OUT SPACE IN THE IN THE OPEN MARKET IN THE GREATER DOWNTOWN AREA. UNFORTUNATE OUR RESEARCHERS SHOWN THAT THAT LAST OPTION IS QUITE COSTLY. IN FACT WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE OPERATIONAL COST OF OUR HEADQUARTERS BUILDING IT IT AVERAGES OUT TO A LITTLE OVER TWO DOLLARS A SQUARE FOOT. ONE FORTUNATELY IN THE OPEN MARKET OUR RESEARCH IS SHOWING ITS UPWARDS OF THREE TO SOMETIMES DOING A HALF DOLLARS A SQUARE FOOT. SO THAT OUR PROPOSAL YOU YOU MIGHT HAVE RECOGNIZED A CHART THAT CHART TRIES TO SHOWS THAT SHOW THAT DISTINCTION OF HOW MUCH MONEY WE WE WOULD BE SPENT ON THE OPEN MARKET. AND THROUGH OUR PROPOSAL IF YOU WERE TO ADOPT THAT TODAY WE STAND TO SAVE THE STATE UPWARDS OF TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS OVER THE COURSE OF TEN YEARS. AND AND THEN OF COURSE AS AS I MENTIONED EARLIER COUNTY PA WILL ENDORSE WE SUSPECT EVEN LONGER TERM SAVINGS ACTING OUT YEARS. SO FROM FROM OUR STANDPOINT THIS JUST MAKES GOOD BUSINESS SAMSON AND ESPECIALLY FROM A FISCAL STANDPOINT AND I'LL LEAVE YOU A THREE THREE KEY POINTS. AS YOU KNOW WE THE STATE WILL ON THIS BUILDING AT THE END OF FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY THREE. AND SO. WERE CASHING IN ON THE STATE'S TWENTY FIVE YOUR INVESTMENT OF PURCHASING THIS BUILDING AT THE LOW COST OF ONE DOLLAR SO IT BECOMES A NICE STATE AS. WERE ALSO MAXIMIZING HONO CURRENT FOOTPRINT IN CALIFORNIA'S FIRST EVER LEAD PLATINUM BUILDING. AS YOU MIGHT KNOW KELLY PA'S ARE. PRETTY WELL KNOWN BUILDINGS VERY PRESTIGIOUS AND WHAT WE WANT TO CONTINUE THAT. WITH KEEPING OUR FOLKS IN HOME. AND THEN FINALLY. BY ADOPTING THIS PROPOSAL RIGHT HERE IN TO THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER FROM A FEW YEARS AGO THAT REQUIRES ALL STATE AGENCIES TO MAXIMIZE THEIR CO FOR. KURT CURRENT FOOTPRINT SEES ME AND SHY AWAY FROM. LEASE SPACE OUTSIDE OF STATE COFFERS. SO WHEN YOU CONSIDER ALL THAT IF IT JUST MAKES GOOD BUSINESS SENSE TO TO ADOPT OUR PROPOSAL. AND I NOTICED IN THE STAFF AGENDA THERE WAS A QUESTION ABOUT. HOW WE ARRIVED AT THESE COSTS AND IF YOU PLEASE THE CHAIR I'M HAPPY TO GO OVER THAT? THEY'RE NOT THAT DON'T CONCLUDE YOU COULD GIVE US. KIND OF AND. AN OUTLINE OF. HOW YOU ARRIVED AT THAT WOULD BE SURE? AND AS YOU KNOW THIS IS PHASE ONE OF THE TWO PHASE PROJECT PHASE ONE. IS ONLY INVOLVING THE AIRPORT THE WATER BOARD CAO RECYCLE AND AND WE HIGH SO THAT'S WHY THEY'RE THE ONLY THE ONES BEARING THE COST BECAUSE OF TODAY. MORE IMPORTANTLY IN THE WAY WE COST ALLOCATE ALL OF OUR BUILDING EXPENSES WE TRY AND DO A FAIR SHARE AN EQUITABLE SHARE BASED ON. AGENCY SIZE SO FOR THE FLOORS IT WILL BE IMPACTED AIR BE HAS THE BIGGEST FOOTPRINT THEN THE WATERBOARDING TERRACYCLE BEEN A WEEK. AND SO THAT'S HOW THE COSTS WILL BOARD TO APPROVE WARM THROUGH APPROPRIATE. TIME PROCESS. THANK YOU. THE. TWENTY THREE A MILLION DOLLAR ROUGHLY. ACOSTA IT'S A A IN THIS PROPOSAL. COVERS THE RETROFITTING OF APPROXIMATELY HOW MANY OFFICES I UNDERSTAND IT. I THINK IT IT'S CREATING UP ABOUT A THOUSAND NEW. THE CUBICLES YEAH BUT IT ALSO RETROFITS OR. RE A GREAT DOES.
