00:34:44.148 --> 00:34:45.716
CONSIDER WHAT A BROAD OVERHAUL

00:34:45.783 --> 00:34:46.884
OF OUR FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM

00:34:46.951 --> 00:34:48.152
COULD LOOK LIKE.

00:34:48.219 --> 00:34:48.953
SO THE FIRST PRINCIPLE ARE

00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:50.855
COMMISSION ADOPTED WAS TO REMOVE

00:34:50.922 --> 00:34:52.824
OR REDUCE ELIGIBILITY BARRIERS

00:34:52.890 --> 00:34:54.325
TO THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM.

00:34:54.392 --> 00:34:55.560
AS YOU KNOW CAL GRANT IS

00:34:55.626 --> 00:34:57.228
AVAILABLE AS AN ENTITLEMENT TO

00:34:57.295 --> 00:34:58.296
STUDENTS WHO RECENTLY GRADUATED

FROM A COMMUNITY COLLEGE BEFORE

TURNING AGE.

00:35:02.867 --> 00:35:03.701
TWENTY EIGHT HOWEVER CALIFORNIA

00:35:03.768 --> 00:35:06.404
NOW HAS MORE STUDENTS THAN EVER

00:35:06.471 --> 00:35:07.472
FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS

00:35:07.538 --> 00:35:08.706
ATTENDING COLLEGE A LITTLE BIT

00:35:08.773 --> 00:35:09.740
LATER IN LIFE.

00:35:09.807 --> 00:35:11.375
SIMILARLY WE HAVE A GREAT NUMBER

00:35:11.442 --> 00:35:12.643
OF TRANSFER STUDENTS WHO ARE

KNOWLEDGE IN AN EVER CHANGING

00:35:17.615 --> 00:35:19.183

CAL GRANT IS NOT AVAILABLE AS AN

FOR ONE OF JUST UNDER TWENTY SIX

00:35:24.922 --> 00:35:25.790
THOUSAND AVAILABLE COMPETITIVE

00:35:25.857 --> 00:35:26.624
CAL GRANT AWARDS.

00:35:26.691 --> 00:35:28.726
FROM A POOL OF OVER THREE

HUNDRED THOUSAND ELIGIBLE

00:35:29.327 --> 00:35:30.628
APPLICANTS SO THAT' MORE THAN A

00:35:30.695 --> 00:35:31.863
QUARTER OF A MILLION STUDENTS

00:35:31.929 --> 00:35:33.564
WHO HAVE SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL

00:35:33.631 --> 00:35:34.265

00:35:34.332 --> 00:35:35.700
AND QUALIFY FOR CAL GRANT THAT

00:35:35.766 --> 00:35:37.034

00:35:38.970 --> 00:35:40.538
AS PART OF REMOVING BARRIERS TO

00:35:40.605 --> 00:35:42.306
PARTICIPATING IN THE PROGRAM THE

00:35:42.373 --> 00:35:44.008
LEGISLATURE MAY WISH TO CONSIDER

00:35:44.075 --> 00:35:45.443
WE CONSIDER THE REQUIREMENT THAT

00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:46.244
YOU CAN BE A RECENT HIGH SCHOOL

00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:47.678

00:35:48.779 --> 00:35:50.281
DOES THIS TIME LIMIT ADEQUATELY

00:35:50.348 --> 00:35:52.283
SERVE THE STUDENTS OF TODAY MANY

00:35:52.350 --> 00:35:53.551
OF WHOM HAVE VALID REASONS FOR

00:35:53.618 --> 00:35:55.520
TAKING A BIT LONGER AFTER HIGH

00:35:55.586 --> 00:35:56.354
SCHOOL TO BEGIN COLLEGE.

00:35:56.420 --> 00:35:57.555
ON THAT SAME NOTE THE

00:35:57.622 --> 00:35:58.890
LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER AND I

00:35:58.956 --> 00:35:59.724
KNOW THERE'S BEEN LEGISLATION

00:35:59.790 --> 00:36:01.192
INTRODUCED UP ON THIS FRONT

00:36:01.259 --> 00:36:02.560
RAISING OR REPEALING THE AGE

00:36:02.627 --> 00:36:03.628
LIMIT ON THE TRANSFER

00:36:03.694 --> 00:36:04.795
ENTITLEMENT PROGRAMS SO THAT

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.067
THE COMMISSION SECOND GUIDING

00:36:10.134 --> 00:36:11.435
PRINCIPLE FOR FINANCIALLY TO

00:36:11.502 --> 00:36:12.670
FORM IS AS ASSEMBLYMEMBERS

00:36:12.737 --> 00:36:14.205
MCCARTY MEDINA REFERENCED

00:36:14.272 --> 00:36:15.706
CONSIDERING THE TOTAL COST OF

00:36:15.773 --> 00:36:17.308
ATTENDANCE STUDENTS FACE.

00:36:17.375 --> 00:36:18.376
AS YOU'RE OF COURSE AWARE THE

00:36:18.442 --> 00:36:19.477
CAL GRANT PROGRAMS LARGELY

00:36:19.544 --> 00:36:20.378
GEARED TOWARDS HELPING STUDENTS

00:36:20.444 --> 00:36:21.979
AFFORD TUITION WHICH IS REALLY

00:36:22.046 --> 00:36:23.247
THE MOST SIGNIFICANT COSTS FOR

00:36:23.314 --> 00:36:25.082
TYPICAL STUDENT.

00:36:25.149 --> 00:36:26.751
JUST TO GIVE.

00:36:26.817 --> 00:36:27.885
ONE EXAMPLE THAT'S NOT PURELY

00:36:27.952 --> 00:36:29.253
HYPOTHETICAL IN A LITTLE BIT

00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:29.854
PARTS OF THE SACRAMENTO STATE

00:36:29.921 --> 00:36:31.422
MYSELF BUT FOR A STUDENT

00:36:31.489 --> 00:36:32.723
ATTENDING SACRAMENTO STATE THAT

00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:33.858
CAN EXPECT TO PAY A LITTLE BIT

00:36:33.925 --> 00:36:35.760
OVER SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IN

00:36:35.826 --> 00:36:36.661
TUITION AND FEES.

00:36:36.727 --> 00:36:37.828
BUT WHEN YOU ADD BOOKS AND

00:36:37.895 --> 00:36:39.297
SUPPLIES ROOM AND BOARD

00:36:39.363 --> 00:36:40.665
TRANSPORTATION AND OTHER

00:36:40.731 --> 00:36:42.667
ESSENTIAL COSTS THE TYPICAL FULL

00:36:42.733 --> 00:36:44.068
TIME STUDENT LIVING ON THEIR OWN

00:36:44.135 --> 00:36:45.436
GOING TO SACRAMENTO STATE WOLD

00:36:45.503 --> 00:36:46.737
SEE A TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE.

00:36:46.804 --> 00:36:48.472
EASILY EXCEEDING TWENTY FIVE

00:36:48.539 --> 00:36:51.342
THOUSAND DOLLARS STUDENTS CAN

00:36:51.409 --> 00:36:52.310
RECEIVE CAL GRANT AID TO HELP

00:36:52.376 --> 00:36:54.211
WITH THESE NOT TUITION COSTS IN

00:36:54.278 --> 00:36:55.713
THE FORM OF OUR CAL GRANT BE

00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:56.581
ACCESS AWARD.

00:36:56.647 --> 00:36:58.316
WITHOUT A WORD IS LESS THAN

00:36:58.382 --> 00:36:58.916
SEVENTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS PER

00:36:58.983 --> 00:37:00.618
YEAR AND HAS NOT KEPT PACE WITH

00:37:00.685 --> 00:37:01.953
INFLATION SINCE IT WAS FIRST

00:37:02.019 --> 00:37:03.387
ENACTED IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES.

00:37:03.454 --> 00:37:05.323
IF IT HAD IT WOULD BE WORTH MORE

00:37:05.389 --> 00:37:08.960
THAN SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS TODAY.

00:37:09.026 --> 00:37:09.894
SO WHILE THE COMMISSION HAS NOT

00:37:09.961 --> 00:37:11.629
ENDORSED A SPECIFIC APPROACH FOR

00:37:11.696 --> 00:37:13.230
ADDRESSING THIS PRINCIPLE THE

00:37:13.297 --> 00:37:14.599
LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER AND

00:37:14.665 --> 00:37:15.633
THERE'S BEEN LEGISLATION AGAIN

00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:18.069
INTRODUCED ON THIS FRONT AS WELL.

00:37:18.135 --> 00:37:19.070
A NEW MODEL FOR THE CAL GRANT

00:37:19.136 --> 00:37:20.204
PROGRAM THAT SEEKS TO HELP

00:37:20.271 --> 00:37:21.639
STUDENTS OF FOR THEIR TOTAL COST

00:37:21.706 --> 00:37:22.573
OF ATTENDANCE.

00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:23.908
SO THIS MIGHT ENTAIL OVERHAULING

00:37:23.975 --> 00:37:25.476
THE PROGRAM TO ENSURE THAT OUR

00:37:25.543 --> 00:37:27.144
STUDENTS TOTAL AID PACKAGE WHICH

00:37:27.211 --> 00:37:28.980
INCLUDES FEDERAL AID ANY AMOUNT

00:37:29.046 --> 00:37:29.914
THE STUDENTS PARENTS OR FAMILY

00:37:29.981 --> 00:37:31.582
CAN CONTRIBUTE AND SOME

00:37:31.649 --> 00:37:33.851
REASONABLE EXPECTATION OF EITHER

00:37:33.918 --> 00:37:35.152
LOANS ARE WORKING COME ON THE

00:37:35.219 --> 00:37:35.953
STUDENTS BEHALF.

00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:38.222
IS SUFFICIENT TO A FOR THE TOTAL

00:37:38.289 --> 00:37:40.424
COST OF ATTENDANCE.

00:37:40.491 --> 00:37:40.958
THE COMMISSION'S FINAL TO

00:37:41.025 --> 00:37:42.059
PRINCIPLES RELATE TO SPECIFIC

00:37:42.126 --> 00:37:42.827
COMPONENTS OF THE CAL GRANT

00:37:42.893 --> 00:37:44.228
PROGRAM THAT A STATE FINANCIAL

00:37:44.295 --> 00:37:46.631
AID LEADERS WE ARE PRIORITIZED.

00:37:46.697 --> 00:37:47.531
THE FIRST HAS TO DO WITH CAL

00:37:47.598 --> 00:37:48.466
GRANTS FOR STUDENTS ATTENDING

00:37:48.532 --> 00:37:50.801
PRIVATE NONPROFIT INSTITUTIONS

00:37:50.868 --> 00:37:51.636
SO PRIVATE COLLEGES AND

00:37:51.702 --> 00:37:52.937
UNIVERSITIES ARE CRUCIAL TO

00:37:53.004 --> 00:37:53.971
CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY AND OUR

00:37:54.038 --> 00:37:56.440
HIGHER EDUCATION ECOSYSTEM AS WE

00:37:56.507 --> 00:37:57.742
LIKE TO CALL IT SOMETIMES.

00:37:57.808 --> 00:37:59.377
SCHOOLS IN THE ASSOCIATION OF

00:37:59.443 --> 00:38:00.778
INDEPENDENT CALIFORNIA COLLEGES

00:38:00.845 --> 00:38:03.347
UNIVERSITIES EDUCATE OVER THREE

00:38:03.414 --> 00:38:03.881
HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS

00:38:03.948 --> 00:38:05.316
INCLUDING NEARLY TWO HUNDRED

00:38:05.383 --> 00:38:05.916
THOUSAND UNDERGRADUATES EVERY

00:38:05.983 --> 00:38:06.884
YEAR.

00:38:06.951 --> 00:38:08.819
HOWEVER THESE STUDENTS CAL GRANT

00:38:08.886 --> 00:38:10.154
AWARDS ARE NOT LINKED TO TUITION

00:38:10.221 --> 00:38:11.822
BUTTER INSTEAD SAID A FLAT RATE

00:38:11.889 --> 00:38:13.190
CURRENTLY A LITTLE OVER NINE

00:38:13.257 --> 00:38:14.191
THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR FOR A

00:38:14.258 --> 00:38:15.593
FULL TIME STUDENT.

00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:16.861
ON FORTY THIS AWARD HAS NEVER

00:38:16.927 --> 00:38:18.529
BEEN INCREASED AND HAS EVEN BEEN

00:38:18.596 --> 00:38:20.331
REDUCED ONCE ALREADY --

00:38:20.398 --> 00:38:21.799
AND IS THUS LOST A SIGNIFICANT

00:38:21.866 --> 00:38:22.700
AMOUNT OF ITS VALUE IN RECENT

00:38:22.767 --> 00:38:24.335
YEARS MAKING IT EVER MORE

00:38:24.402 --> 00:38:25.803
DIFFICULT FOR THE STUDENTS TO A

00:38:25.870 --> 00:38:27.238
FOR THEIR EDUCATION. TO ENSURE

00:38:27.304 --> 00:38:28.973
THAT STUDENTS ARE ALL SEGMENTS

00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:30.241
OF HIGHER EDUCATION HAVE THAT

00:38:30.307 --> 00:38:31.676
OPPORTUNITY THE STUDENT A

00:38:31.742 --> 00:38:32.710
COMMISSION HAS ADOPTED THE

00:38:32.777 --> 00:38:33.878
PRINCIPLE THAT REFORMING OUR

00:38:33.944 --> 00:38:35.446
STATE FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM.

00:38:35.513 --> 00:38:38.249
SHOULD INCLUDE RESTORING AN

00:38:38.315 --> 00:38:41.819
ANNUAL JUST INSTITUTIONS SO THAT

00:38:41.886 --> 00:38:43.521
THAT AWARD --

00:38:43.587 --> 00:38:44.822
EITHER INCREASES OR AT LEAST NO

00:38:44.889 --> 00:38:46.223
NO NO LONGER DECLINED IN VALUE

00:38:46.290 --> 00:38:47.591
YEAR OVER YEAR.

00:38:47.658 --> 00:38:48.592
FINALLY THE COMMISSION HAS

00:38:48.659 --> 00:38:49.527
ENDORSED THE PRINCIPLE THAT

00:38:49.593 --> 00:38:51.095
STUDENTS TAKING SUMMER COURSE

00:38:51.162 --> 00:38:52.196
WORK SHOULD NOT BE PENALIZED BY

00:38:52.263 --> 00:38:53.097
HAVING THEIR CAL GRANT

00:38:53.164 --> 00:38:54.365
ELIGIBILITY REDUCED.

00:38:54.432 --> 00:38:56.067
ANOTHER ISSUE ON WHICH OUR

00:38:56.133 --> 00:38:57.601
STUDENT LEADERS HAVE THAT IN

00:38:57.668 --> 00:38:59.170
PARTICULAR --

00:38:59.236 --> 00:39:01.505
TAKEN LEAD AND FOR INTRODUCING

00:39:01.572 --> 00:39:02.239
LEGISLATION ON THIS FRONT

00:39:02.306 --> 00:39:02.973
ALREADY.

00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:04.308
CURRENTLY STUDENTS OF YEARS THE

00:39:04.375 --> 00:39:05.509
CAL GRANT AWARD DURING THE

00:39:05.576 --> 00:39:06.877
SUMMER OR REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF

00:39:06.944 --> 00:39:08.179
ELIGIBILITY THEY WILL HAVE LATER

00:39:08.245 --> 00:39:10.014
ON AND MAY ACTUALLY RUN OUT OF

00:39:10.081 --> 00:39:11.248
CAL GRANT ELIGIBILITY ENTIRELY

00:39:11.315 --> 00:39:12.416
BEFORE THEY'VE COMPLETED THEIR

00:39:12.483 --> 00:39:13.718
SENIOR YEAR.

00:39:13.784 --> 00:39:15.019
MANY STUDENTS NEED TO TAKE

00:39:15.086 --> 00:39:15.920
SUMMER COURSES IN ORDER TO

00:39:15.986 --> 00:39:17.188
GRADUATE IN A TIMELY MANNER AND

00:39:17.254 --> 00:39:19.657
AVOID HAVING TO COME BACK FOR A

00:39:19.724 --> 00:39:21.225
FIFTH OR SIXTH YEAR.

00:39:21.292 --> 00:39:22.359
SO THESE ARE THE PRINCIPLES OF

00:39:22.426 --> 00:39:23.894
FINANCIAL AID REFORM THE THROUGH

00:39:23.961 --> 00:39:25.429
NAY COMMISSION HAS ADOPTED --

00:39:25.496 --> 00:39:26.564
I WOULD JUST LIKE TO CLOSE BY

00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:27.732
POINTING OUT THAT AS ASSEMBLY

00:39:27.798 --> 00:39:29.200
MEMBER MEDINA REFERENCED THE

00:39:29.266 --> 00:39:30.701
COMMISSION IS A VERY MUCH AWARE

00:39:30.768 --> 00:39:31.902
HOW COMPLEX OUR STATE

00:39:31.969 --> 00:39:33.070
FINANCIALLY SYSTEM IS.

00:39:33.137 --> 00:39:34.205
AND TO THAT END WE ARE

00:39:34.271 --> 00:39:36.207
OPTIMISTIC THAT WORKING WITH OUR

00:39:36.273 --> 00:39:37.775
STAKEHOLDERS --

00:39:37.842 --> 00:39:39.510
OUR PARTNERS AND STUDENTS THE

00:39:39.577 --> 00:39:41.045
LEGISLATURE THE MINISTRATION CAN

00:39:41.112 --> 00:39:43.080
ENACT A COMPREHENSIVE FINANCIAL

00:39:43.147 --> 00:39:45.082
AID OVERHAUL BUT SIMPLIFIES AND

00:39:45.149 --> 00:39:46.350
STREAMLINES THE CAL GRANT

00:39:46.417 --> 00:39:47.251
PROGRAM FOR STUDENTS AND

00:39:47.318 --> 00:39:48.919
FAMILIES WELL SEEKING TO BETTER

00:39:48.986 --> 00:39:50.287
DRESS THE TOTAL COST OF

00:39:50.354 --> 00:39:51.155
ATTENDANCE.

00:39:51.222 --> 00:39:52.356
SO THAT EVERY CALIFORNIA STUDENT

00:39:52.423 --> 00:39:54.558
HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE

00:39:54.625 --> 00:39:56.160
THE DREAM OF HIGHER EDUCATION.

00:39:56.227 --> 00:39:57.128
THANK YOU AGAIN FOR HAVING HERE

SYSTEM UNDER CONTRACT FOR THE

00:40:24.155 --> 00:40:25.689
STATE NAY COMMISSION WE FOUND A

00:40:25.756 --> 00:40:27.491
SYSTEM THAT DOES AN EXCELLENT

00:40:27.558 --> 00:40:29.093
JOB COMPARED TO OTHER STATES.

00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:31.028
BUT WE ALSO SAW ENORMOUS

00:40:31.095 --> 00:40:32.563
OPPORTUNITY FOR CALIFORNIA TO DO

00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:33.864
BETTER.

00:40:33.931 --> 00:40:36.333
AFTER OUR SIXTIES CONTRACT ENDED

00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:38.202

COMMITTED TO REDUCING INEQUALITY

00:40:40.237 --> 00:40:41.539
WE DECIDED TO INDEPENDENTLY

00:40:41.605 --> 00:40:43.407
CONSIDER CONTINUE THE WORK THAT

00:40:43.474 --> 00:40:44.608
WE HAD BEGUN.

00:40:44.675 --> 00:40:46.043
I'D LIKE TO START BY TELLING YOU

00:40:46.110 --> 00:40:48.179
ABOUT A NEW STUDY THAT CAME OUT

00:40:48.245 --> 00:40:50.181
IN DECEMBER THAT --

00:40:50.247 --> 00:40:51.849
IN BEYOND THE TIMELINE OF OUR

00:40:51.916 --> 00:40:53.818
OUR REPORT THIS WAS WHAT IS

00:40:53.884 --> 00:40:56.020
KNOWN AS A RANDOMIZED TRIAL OR

00:40:56.086 --> 00:40:58.956
THE GOLD STANDARD OF OF SOCIAL

00:40:59.023 --> 00:41:00.624
SCIENCE RESEARCH THESE TYPES OF

00:41:00.691 --> 00:41:01.392
STUDIES.

00:41:01.458 --> 00:41:03.093
ARE SO RIGOROUS THAT THEY

00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:05.729
FREQUENTLY FIND ONLY SMALL

00:41:05.796 --> 00:41:07.565
IMPACTS FROM THE INTERVENTIONS

00:41:07.631 --> 00:41:09.466
THAT THEY TEST TEST IF ANY

00:41:09.533 --> 00:41:10.801
IMPACTS AT ALL.

00:41:10.868 --> 00:41:12.736
THIS RESEARCH THOUGH FOUND VERY

00:41:12.803 --> 00:41:14.171
LARGE EFFECTS INDICATING THAT

00:41:14.238 --> 00:41:15.973
THE INTERVENTION HAD A LOT OF

00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:18.442
POWER TO AFFECT THE BEHAVIOR OF

00:41:18.509 --> 00:41:21.345
LOW INCOME FAMILIES AND STUDENTS.

00:41:21.412 --> 00:41:23.013
HERE'S WHAT THEY DID.

00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:24.849
THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN SENT

00:41:24.915 --> 00:41:26.851
LETTERS TO LOW INCOME HIGH

00:41:26.917 --> 00:41:28.485
SCHOOL STUDENTS WHO ACCORDING TO

00:41:28.552 --> 00:41:29.687
THE HIGH SCHOOL RECORDS WOULD

00:41:29.753 --> 00:41:31.655
LIKELY QUALIFY FOR ADMISSION BUT

00:41:31.722 --> 00:41:33.224
THIS WAS WELL BEFORE THE

00:41:33.290 --> 00:41:35.893
TIMELINE FOR ACTUALLY APPLYING.

00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:37.394
AS PART OF THIS LETTER THEY TOLD

00:41:37.461 --> 00:41:38.696
THE STUDENTS THAT IF THEY WERE

00:41:38.762 --> 00:41:40.464
ACCEPTED THEY WOULD BE

00:41:40.531 --> 00:41:41.732
GUARANTEED A FULL TUITION

00:41:41.799 --> 00:41:42.933
SCHOLARSHIP.

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:44.935
COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP

00:41:45.002 --> 00:41:46.971
THESE LOW INCOME STUDENTS WHO

00:41:47.037 --> 00:41:48.372
GOT THE TUITION SCHOLARSHIP

00:41:48.439 --> 00:41:50.407
MESSAGE WERE MORE THAN TWICE AS

00:41:50.474 --> 00:41:51.876
LIKELY TO APPLY TO THE

00:41:51.942 --> 00:41:55.112
UNIVERSITY AND TWICE AS LIKELY

00:41:55.179 --> 00:41:55.412
TO ENROLL.

00:41:55.479 --> 00:41:58.182
THAT IS A VERY LARGE AFFECT FOR

00:41:58.249 --> 00:41:59.917
A STUDY LIKE THIS THE KICKER ON

00:41:59.984 --> 00:42:01.485
THIS STORY IS THAT THE FINANCIAL

00:42:01.552 --> 00:42:03.120
AID FUNDING WAS ACTUALLY NO

00:42:03.187 --> 00:42:05.256
DIFFERENT BETWEEN THE TREATMENT

00:42:05.322 --> 00:42:05.623
GROUP.

00:42:05.689 --> 00:42:08.425
AND THE AND THE CONTROL GROUP

00:42:08.492 --> 00:42:10.194
BUT IT WAS FAR MORE EFFECTIVE

00:42:10.261 --> 00:42:12.363
FOR THE TREATMENT GROUP LIKELY

00:42:12.429 --> 00:42:14.632
FOR TWO REASONS. ONE IS THAT IT

00:42:14.698 --> 00:42:17.001
WAS PERSONALIZED IT WAS SPECIFIC

00:42:17.067 --> 00:42:18.302
TO THE STUDENT RATHER THAN THE

00:42:18.369 --> 00:42:20.371
GENERAL STATEMENTS THAT WE

00:42:20.437 --> 00:42:21.839
USUALLY MAKE ABOUT FINANCIAL AID.

00:42:21.906 --> 00:42:26.477
ALSO IT WAS VERY GEN IS TOTALLY

00:42:26.543 --> 00:42:28.178
COVERED AND PEOPLE WORRY ABOUT

00:42:28.245 --> 00:42:29.046
TUITION.

00:42:29.113 --> 00:42:31.649
NOW THOSE OF US IN THIS HEARING

00:42:31.715 --> 00:42:33.851
KNOW THAT THE COLLEGE COSTS THAT

00:42:33.918 --> 00:42:35.653
ARE THE BIGGEST BARRIERS TO

00:42:35.719 --> 00:42:37.554
CALIFORNIA'S LOW INCOME STUDENTS

00:42:37.621 --> 00:42:39.590
ACTUALLY SUCCEEDING IN COLLEGE

00:42:39.657 --> 00:42:41.759
ARE FREQUENTLY NOT JUST THOSE

00:42:41.825 --> 00:42:43.961
TUITION COSTS BUT INSTEAD.

00:42:44.028 --> 00:42:46.363
OTHER EXPENSES AND WE MUST NOT

00:42:46.430 --> 00:42:48.532
LOSE SIGHT OF THAT WHILE WE ALSO

00:42:48.599 --> 00:42:51.235
AT THE SAME TIME RECOGNIZE THAT

00:42:51.302 --> 00:42:53.971
WE NEED THAT THAT A WAY OF

00:42:54.038 --> 00:42:56.540
HOOKING STUDENTS IS TO LET THEM

00:42:56.607 --> 00:42:58.208
KNOW THAT THEIR TO THAT TUITION

00:42:58.275 --> 00:42:59.310
ITSELF.

00:42:59.376 --> 00:43:00.744
IS NOT A PROBLEM.

00:43:00.811 --> 00:43:02.479
SO -- THAT

00:43:02.546 --> 00:43:04.415
POWERFUL MOTIVATOR FOR LOW

00:43:04.481 --> 00:43:07.051
INCOME FAMILIES IS CRITICAL AND

00:43:07.117 --> 00:43:08.152
IT'S THE MOST POWERFUL WHEN IT

00:43:08.218 --> 00:43:10.821
IS DELIVERED IN A TARGETED WAY

00:43:10.888 --> 00:43:12.790
WHICH IS COMPLETELY CONSISTENT

00:43:12.856 --> 00:43:15.659
WITH A NEED BASED SYSTEM THAT

00:43:15.726 --> 00:43:17.461
CALIFORNIA HAS.

00:43:17.528 --> 00:43:17.928
THAT'S WHY WHAT WE'RE

00:43:17.995 --> 00:43:20.531
RECOMMENDING IS EIGHT TUITION

00:43:20.597 --> 00:43:23.000
PLUS APPROACH TO REFORMING CAL

00:43:23.067 --> 00:43:25.769
GRANTS IT WOULD HAVE TO PARTS

00:43:25.836 --> 00:43:28.072
THAT CONTINUE TO BE BASED ON

00:43:28.138 --> 00:43:28.505
NEED.

00:43:28.572 --> 00:43:31.408
A CAL GRANT TUITION SCHOLARSHIP

00:43:31.475 --> 00:43:34.178
AND CAL GRANT PLUS SCHOLARSHIPS.

00:43:34.244 --> 00:43:35.512
THE CAL GRANT TUITION

00:43:35.579 --> 00:43:37.348
SCHOLARSHIPS WOULD BE LIKE THE

00:43:37.414 --> 00:43:39.283
CAL GRANTS WE HAVE NOW BUT WITH

00:43:39.350 --> 00:43:41.251
EXPANDED ELIGIBILITY THAT

00:43:41.318 --> 00:43:43.087
ELIMINATES THE GPA TIME OUT OF

00:43:43.153 --> 00:43:45.589
HIGH SCHOOL AND AGE RESTRICTIONS.

00:43:45.656 --> 00:43:46.890
THE PROGRAM SHOULD BE DESIGNED

00:43:46.957 --> 00:43:48.258
TO INCORPORATE THOSE CURRENTLY

00:43:48.325 --> 00:43:50.027
AVAILABLE ELIGIBLE INCLUDING

00:43:50.094 --> 00:43:51.495
THOSE WHO ARE GETTING PARTIAL

00:43:51.562 --> 00:43:53.664
TUITION COVERAGE AND OF THE

00:43:53.731 --> 00:43:55.232
MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM.

00:43:55.299 --> 00:43:57.735
IN ADDITION STUDENTS WHO QUALIFY

00:43:57.801 --> 00:43:59.503
BASED ON NEED WOULD GET CAL

00:43:59.570 --> 00:44:01.805
GRANT PLUS SCHOLARSHIPS TO

00:44:01.872 --> 00:44:03.640
ADDRESS REMAINING GAPS AFTER

00:44:03.707 --> 00:44:06.043
CONSIDERING A FAMILIES EFC TELL

00:44:06.110 --> 00:44:08.512
GRANTS AND A WORK EXPECTATION.

00:44:08.579 --> 00:44:09.880
WELL THE TUITION SCHOLARSHIP

00:44:09.947 --> 00:44:12.082
PROVIDED BY C. SACK WOULD BE AT

00:44:12.149 --> 00:44:13.584
A FIXED LEVEL.

00:44:13.650 --> 00:44:15.519
THE CAL GRANT PLUS SCHOLARSHIP

00:44:15.586 --> 00:44:17.521
WOULD BE MORE IN THE HANDS OF

00:44:17.588 --> 00:44:19.790
THE SEGMENTS AND THE CAMPUSES TO

00:44:19.857 --> 00:44:21.825
MAKE FINAL ALLOCATIONS BASED ON

00:44:21.892 --> 00:44:24.828
LOCAL AND STUDENTS SPECIFIC

00:44:24.895 --> 00:44:25.062
FACTORS.

00:44:25.129 --> 00:44:26.663
THE FUND IN FOR THESE

00:44:26.730 --> 00:44:27.598
SCHOLARSHIPS WOULD COME FROM A

00:44:27.664 --> 00:44:29.199
COMBINATION OF EXISTING

00:44:29.266 --> 00:44:31.835
INSTITUTIONAL A DOLLARS AND NEW

00:44:31.902 --> 00:44:33.771

WE LAY OUT MORE DETAILS ABOUT

00:44:35.639 --> 00:44:37.241
THIS OF THIS APPROACH AND THREE

00:44:37.307 --> 00:44:38.675

ATTACHED TO MY WRITTEN TO MATT

00:44:40.144 --> 00:44:41.278
TESTIMONY TODAY.

00:44:41.345 --> 00:44:42.980
DISCUSSING HOW TOTAL COSTS

00:44:43.047 --> 00:44:45.649
SHOULD BE ESTIMATED HOW THE EFC

00:44:45.716 --> 00:44:47.751
CAN BE SET AND HOW FUNDS WOULD

00:44:47.818 --> 00:44:49.686
BE ALLOCATED TO COLLEGES AND TO

00:44:49.753 --> 00:44:51.789
STUDENTS IN A TUITION PLUS CAL

00:44:51.855 --> 00:44:53.757

LAID OUT AN IMPORTANT SET OF

00:45:00.731 --> 00:45:02.366
PRINCIPLES THAT ARE WORTH

00:45:02.433 --> 00:45:05.169
CONSIDERING. ONE WAS BUILT ON

AGREE THAT'S THE REASON FAR

00:45:19.016 --> 00:45:21.085
RECOMMENDATION FOR A CAL GRANT

00:45:21.151 --> 00:45:22.820

GRANTS ELIMINATING THAT GPA AND

00:45:30.027 --> 00:45:31.929
OTHER RESTRICTIONS WOULD

00:45:31.995 --> 00:45:33.397
ACCOMPLISH EXACTLY THAT.

00:45:33.464 --> 00:45:34.631
SUMMER PAL IS ONE OF THEIR

00:45:34.698 --> 00:45:38.469
PRINCIPLES WE PROBABLY AN AREA

THAT DOES MAKE SENSE TO ADDRESS.

00:45:40.170 --> 00:45:42.106
AND FIFTH THEY SAID MAINTAIN THE

OF ATTENDANCE.

00:45:45.409 --> 00:45:47.377
THAT IS A CRITICALLY IMPORTANT

00:45:47.444 --> 00:45:49.546
GOAL AND WHERE --

00:45:49.613 --> 00:45:51.715
BUT IT BUT MORE FUNDING IS

00:45:51.782 --> 00:45:53.083

00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:41.498
I'M DEBBIE COCHRAN EXECUTIVE

00:46:41.565 --> 00:46:42.833
VICE PRESIDENT OF THE INSTITUTE

00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:44.234
FOR COLLEGE ACCESS AND SUCCESS

00:46:44.301 --> 00:46:45.335
FOR TO GUESS --

00:46:45.402 --> 00:46:46.803
YOU FOR OVER A DECADE ART

00:46:46.870 --> 00:46:48.338
ANALYSES HAVE SHOWN THAT DESPITE

00:46:48.405 --> 00:46:50.240
DESPITE THE STATE'S FOCUS ON

00:46:50.307 --> 00:46:51.808
KEEPING IN TUITION LOW AT PUBLIC

00:46:51.875 --> 00:46:53.210
COLLEGES AND HAVING FINANCIAL

00:46:53.277 --> 00:46:54.545
AID PROGRAMS.

00:46:54.611 --> 00:46:56.246
THAT COULD EASILY COVER TUITION --

00:46:56.313 --> 00:46:57.481
THERE ARE REASONS TO BE

00:46:57.548 --> 00:46:59.616
CONCERNED ABOUT COLLEGE --

00:46:59.683 --> 00:47:00.651
FOR WITHOUT BELIEVER IN ALL THE

00:47:00.717 --> 00:47:01.885
POINTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE BY

00:47:01.952 --> 00:47:03.720
MICHAEL PANELISTS ALREADY --

00:47:03.787 --> 00:47:04.354
YOU KNOW BECAUSE THE CALL TOTAL

00:47:04.421 --> 00:47:05.489
COSTS OF COLLEGE INCLUDES A

00:47:05.556 --> 00:47:06.757
WHOLE RANGE OF COSTS BEYOND

00:47:06.823 --> 00:47:08.892
TUITION BOOKS AND SUPPLIES

00:47:08.959 --> 00:47:10.127
TEXTBOOKS.

00:47:10.194 --> 00:47:12.095
TRANSPORTATION REMEMBER WARD --

00:47:12.162 --> 00:47:13.330
BUT OUR AID POLICIES REMAIN

00:47:13.397 --> 00:47:15.966
SKEWED TOWARDS TUITION COSTS --

00:47:16.033 --> 00:47:17.534
AND THIS IS LEAD TO FAR LESS

00:47:17.601 --> 00:47:18.936
SUPPORT FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR

00:47:19.002 --> 00:47:20.103
STUDENTS AT LOWER TUITION

00:47:20.170 --> 00:47:21.471
COLLEGES AND FAR LESS SUPPORT

00:47:21.538 --> 00:47:23.207
MEANS PART GREAT GREATER

00:47:23.273 --> 00:47:24.942
AFFORDABILITY CHALLENGES --

00:47:25.008 --> 00:47:26.376
ACROSS ALL PUBLIC COLLEGES IN

00:47:26.443 --> 00:47:28.045
CALIFORNIA OUR RESEARCH HAS

00:47:28.111 --> 00:47:28.579
SHOWN THAT STUDENTS FROM

00:47:28.645 --> 00:47:30.547
FAMILIES WITH THIRTY THOUSAND

00:47:30.614 --> 00:47:31.915
DOLLARS A FAMILY INCOME ARE LAST.

00:47:31.982 --> 00:47:33.217
IN HOUSEHOLD INCOME HAVE TO

00:47:33.283 --> 00:47:34.751
SPEND ABOUT HALF OR MORE OF

00:47:34.818 --> 00:47:36.486
THEIR TOTAL FAMILY INCOME JUST

00:47:36.553 --> 00:47:38.188
TO PAY FOR COLLEGE COSTS AFTER

00:47:38.255 --> 00:47:39.556
ALL GRANTED IS ALREADY TAKEN

00:47:39.623 --> 00:47:41.024
INTO ACCOUNT --

00:47:41.091 --> 00:47:42.226
THIS IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO

00:47:42.292 --> 00:47:43.694
UNDERSTAND BECAUSE THIS GROUP

00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:45.662
THIS THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS OF

00:47:45.729 --> 00:47:47.030
FAMILY INCOME UNLESS GROUP.

00:47:47.097 --> 00:47:48.265
INCLUDES MORE THAN HALF OF

00:47:48.332 --> 00:47:49.733
LATINO STUDENTS THREE AND FIVE

00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:50.934
NATIVE AMERICAN STUDENTS AND

00:47:51.001 --> 00:47:52.302
NEARLY TWO THIRDS OF BLACK

00:47:52.369 --> 00:47:53.570
STUDENTS.

00:47:53.637 --> 00:47:55.105
SAID THIS IS THIS IS IMPORTANT

00:47:55.172 --> 00:47:56.373
TO UNDERSTAND BECAUSE THESE

00:47:56.440 --> 00:47:58.308
UNTENABLE COLLEGE COSTS ARE NOT

00:47:58.375 --> 00:47:59.343
JUST CONTRIBUTING TO THE STATE'S

00:47:59.409 --> 00:48:00.844
COMPLETION CHALLENGES BUT ALSO

00:48:00.911 --> 00:48:02.813
THE EQUITY GAPS THAT WE SEE.

00:48:02.879 --> 00:48:03.380
IN WHO GETS TO AND THROUGH

00:48:03.447 --> 00:48:05.249
COLLEGE AND WE ALSO SEE THAT

00:48:05.315 --> 00:48:06.617
AMONGST THOSE WHO DO COMPLETE

00:48:06.683 --> 00:48:08.085
IT'S THE LOWER INCOME STUDENTS

00:48:08.151 --> 00:48:09.620
UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS WHO

00:48:09.686 --> 00:48:11.588
ARE MORE LIKELY TO GRADUATE WITH

00:48:11.655 --> 00:48:13.156
BURDENSOME AT THE WE SEE THESE

00:48:13.223 --> 00:48:13.690
TRENDS.

00:48:13.757 --> 00:48:17.327
BECAUSE TOO MANY CALIFORNIANS

00:48:17.394 --> 00:48:18.462
ARE BEING LEFT OUT OF STATE.

00:48:18.528 --> 00:48:21.798
THAT'S WHY WE AS IN OTHER

00:48:21.865 --> 00:48:23.400
ORGANIZATIONS HAVE FOR YEARS

00:48:23.467 --> 00:48:25.035
SUPPORTED COLLEEN'S CALLS FOR

00:48:25.102 --> 00:48:26.136
INCREASES THE NUMBER OF CAL

00:48:26.203 --> 00:48:27.604
GRANTS THAT ARE AVAILABLE IN

00:48:27.671 --> 00:48:29.506
INCREASES TO THE CAL GRANT THAT

00:48:29.573 --> 00:48:31.141
COVERS NON TUITION COSTS.

00:48:31.208 --> 00:48:32.175
OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS WE'VE

00:48:32.242 --> 00:48:34.177
ALSO JOINED THE CALLS TO

00:48:34.244 --> 00:48:34.778
ENCOURAGE THE STATE TO THINK

00:48:34.845 --> 00:48:36.847
BIGGER I'M BEYOND WHAT LEVEL OF

00:48:36.913 --> 00:48:38.348
INCREMENTAL INCREASE THE STATE

00:48:38.415 --> 00:48:39.683
CAN MAKE IN ANY GIVEN YEAR.

00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:41.652
AND INSTEAD TO FOCUS ON WHAT

00:48:41.718 --> 00:48:42.953
STUDENTS NEED.

00:48:43.020 --> 00:48:44.354
AT THIS POINT WE FEEL LIKE THERE

00:48:44.421 --> 00:48:45.956
IS AN EMERGING CONSENSUS ON WHAT

00:48:46.023 --> 00:48:48.125
THAT LOOKS LIKE I'M EVEN WHILE

00:48:48.191 --> 00:48:48.792
DIFFERENCES ON HOW TO GET THERE

00:48:48.859 --> 00:48:49.593
REMAIN.

00:48:49.660 --> 00:48:51.895
IN BRIEF THAT CONSENSUS IS THAT

00:48:51.962 --> 00:48:52.696
THE STATE SHOULD TAKES TO

00:48:52.763 --> 00:48:54.364
STUDENTS TOTAL COSTS OF COLLEGE

00:48:54.431 --> 00:48:55.799
INTO ACCOUNT RATHER THAN JUST

00:48:55.866 --> 00:48:57.267
THEIR TUITION COSTS.

00:48:57.334 --> 00:48:58.602
AND EXPECT THAT STUDENTS AND

00:48:58.669 --> 00:49:00.337
FAMILIES CAN CONTRIBUTE --

00:49:00.404 --> 00:49:01.038
WHAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S

00:49:01.104 --> 00:49:02.472
REASONABLE GIVEN THEIR OWN

00:49:02.539 --> 00:49:04.274
FINANCIAL CIRCUMSTANCES THE REST

00:49:04.341 --> 00:49:05.542
WOULD BE COVERED BY FINANCIAL

00:49:05.609 --> 00:49:06.777
AID FEDERAL FINANCIAL AID

00:49:06.843 --> 00:49:07.744
COLLEGE FINANCIALLY AND STATE

00:49:07.811 --> 00:49:08.845
FINANCIAL AID.

00:49:08.912 --> 00:49:10.280
ON THIS IS AN APPROACH SUGGESTED

00:49:10.347 --> 00:49:12.049
BY T. BECAUSE IN TWENTY SIXTEEN

00:49:12.115 --> 00:49:12.382
BY THE LA --

00:49:12.449 --> 00:49:14.217
IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN BY THE

00:49:14.284 --> 00:49:15.118
CENTURY FOUNDATIONS TO NAY

00:49:15.185 --> 00:49:17.087
COMMISSION AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN

00:49:17.154 --> 00:49:17.621
AND IT'S REFLECTED IN THE

00:49:17.688 --> 00:49:19.122
COMMUNITY COLLEGES PROPOSE FREE

00:49:19.189 --> 00:49:22.592
MARKET INTRODUCED BY SENATOR

00:49:22.659 --> 00:49:23.760
LEVI.

00:49:23.827 --> 00:49:24.394
TWENTY NINETEEN WE BELIEVE THAT

00:49:24.461 --> 00:49:25.295
THIS FRAMEWORK SHOULD SERVE AS A

00:49:25.362 --> 00:49:26.697
NORTH STAR FOR THE STATE AS IT

00:49:26.763 --> 00:49:27.731
FIGURES OUT HOW TO SORT THROUGH

00:49:27.798 --> 00:49:29.366
IMPORTANT POLICY QUESTIONS THAT

00:49:29.433 --> 00:49:30.667
NEED FURTHER ATTENTION.

00:49:30.734 --> 00:49:32.069
SOME OF THE SAME TYPES OF

00:49:32.135 --> 00:49:32.703
QUESTIONS THAT MISTER CHAIRMAN

00:49:32.769 --> 00:49:33.804
MENTIONED.

00:49:33.870 --> 00:49:34.871
I'M IN OCTOBER WE HOSTED A

00:49:34.938 --> 00:49:36.239
CONFERENCE TO BEGIN EXPLORING

00:49:36.306 --> 00:49:37.441
SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS AND WE

00:49:37.507 --> 00:49:38.642
COMMISSION SEVERAL PAPERS

00:49:38.709 --> 00:49:39.710
DESIGNED TO MOVE THE

00:49:39.776 --> 00:49:40.844
CONVERSATION FORWARD.

00:49:40.911 --> 00:49:42.079
WE PUBLISH A COMPENDIUM OF THOSE

00:49:42.145 --> 00:49:43.647
PAPERS WHICH YOU SHOULD HAVE IN

00:49:43.714 --> 00:49:44.681
FRONT OF YOU.

00:49:44.748 --> 00:49:46.083
I'M EARLIER THIS MONTH WE KICKED

00:49:46.149 --> 00:49:47.718
OFF A WORKING GROUP AIMED AT

00:49:47.784 --> 00:49:48.218
BETTER UNDERSTANDING IN

00:49:48.285 --> 00:49:50.420
ARTICULATING AREAS OF AGREEMENT

00:49:50.487 --> 00:49:51.822
AND DISAGREEMENT ON SOME OF

00:49:51.888 --> 00:49:54.157
THESE POLICY DETAILS TO INFORM

00:49:54.224 --> 00:49:56.059
THE STATEWIDE DEBATES. TO PRINT

00:49:56.126 --> 00:49:56.727
THE INSTANCE IN OUR FIRST

00:49:56.793 --> 00:49:58.462
MEETING ARE WE DISCUSSED HOW TO

00:49:58.528 --> 00:49:59.763
DEAL WITH WIDELY DIVERGENT

00:49:59.830 --> 00:50:01.365
ESTIMATES OF WHAT COLLEGE COSTS

00:50:01.431 --> 00:50:03.333
WITHIN A PARTICULAR REGION THINK

00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:04.134
TWO SIDE BY SIDE.

00:50:04.201 --> 00:50:05.836
SCHOOLS THAT HAVE VERY DIFFERENT

00:50:05.902 --> 00:50:07.504
ESTIMATES OF WHAT HOUSING SHOULD

00:50:07.571 --> 00:50:09.039
COST FOR INSTANCE AND THERE'S

00:50:09.106 --> 00:50:10.273
JUST SOME GENERAL AGREEMENT THAT

00:50:10.340 --> 00:50:11.842
GREATER STATE INVOLVEMENT IN

00:50:11.908 --> 00:50:13.543
THESE ESTIMATES SETTING INCH

00:50:13.610 --> 00:50:15.212
WOULD BE WARRANTED.

00:50:15.278 --> 00:50:16.813
I'M WE ALSO I'D HAD DISCUSSED

00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:20.183
THE IDEA OF MAKING REACH C. CALC

00:50:20.250 --> 00:50:21.418
CALCULATION --

00:50:21.485 --> 00:50:22.519
THIS IS THE EXPECTED FAMILY

00:50:22.586 --> 00:50:23.553
CONTRIBUTION CALCULATION FOR

00:50:23.620 --> 00:50:25.322
CALIFORNIA STATE AID.

00:50:25.389 --> 00:50:26.690
I'M WANTED GROUP GENERALLY AGREE

00:50:26.757 --> 00:50:28.225
THAT ESE WAS NOT PERFECT AND

00:50:28.291 --> 00:50:29.092
THERE WERE SOME REASONS TO

00:50:29.159 --> 00:50:30.227
CONSIDER REGIONAL ADJUSTMENTS

00:50:30.293 --> 00:50:31.395
THERE WERE ALSO SOME CONCERNS

00:50:31.461 --> 00:50:33.096
ABOUT THE COMPLEXITY OF ADDINGA

00:50:33.163 --> 00:50:34.431
SECOND STATE SPECIFIC

00:50:34.498 --> 00:50:35.365
CALCULATION.

00:50:35.432 --> 00:50:36.400
AND A GENERAL RECOGNITION THAT

00:50:36.466 --> 00:50:37.367
LOW INCOME STUDENTS WOULD BE

00:50:37.434 --> 00:50:38.835
UNLIKELY TO BENEFIT FROM SUCH AN

00:50:38.902 --> 00:50:41.104
ADJUSTMENT --

00:50:41.171 --> 00:50:42.105
BUT THERE ARE OTHER QUESTIONS

00:50:42.172 --> 00:50:42.806
THAT ALSO WEREN'T GREATER

00:50:42.873 --> 00:50:44.007
ATTENTION AND THEY'VE GOTTEN TO

00:50:44.074 --> 00:50:45.208
DATE AND WE INTEND TO EXPLORE

00:50:45.275 --> 00:50:46.143
THEM WITH OUR WORKING GROUP IN

00:50:46.209 --> 00:50:47.544
SUBSEQUENT MEETINGS SO SOME OF

00:50:47.611 --> 00:50:48.979
THESE QUESTIONS ARE --

00:50:49.045 --> 00:50:50.547
YOU KNOW ELIMINATING ALL STUDENT

00:50:50.614 --> 00:50:52.082
ELIGIBILITY BARRIERS MAY NOT BE

00:50:52.149 --> 00:50:53.150
FEASIBLE.

00:50:53.216 --> 00:50:55.185
SO WHICH ONES ARE MOST IMPORTANT

00:50:55.252 --> 00:50:57.521
TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE AND HOW

00:50:57.587 --> 00:50:59.122
DO WE ORDER THEM.

00:50:59.189 --> 00:50:59.923
ARE THEIR REFORMS THAT THE

00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:01.057
COLLEGES THEMSELVES NEED TO

00:51:01.124 --> 00:51:04.027
PURSUE TO MAXIMIZE THE IMPACT OF

00:51:04.094 --> 00:51:04.928
NEW INVESTMENTS.

00:51:04.995 --> 00:51:05.896
HOW SHOULD THE STATE BE THINKING

00:51:05.962 --> 00:51:07.864
ABOUT PRIVATE COLLEGES WHICH AS

00:51:07.931 --> 00:51:09.032
MISTER BRIAN MENTIONED ARE

00:51:09.099 --> 00:51:10.133
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT PART OF THE

00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:11.301
CALIFORNIA HIGHER EDUCATION

00:51:11.368 --> 00:51:13.403
LANDSCAPE BUT DON'T NECESSARILY

00:51:13.470 --> 00:51:15.472
FIT WELL INTO A TOTAL COST OF

00:51:15.539 --> 00:51:16.807
ATTENDANCE MODEL?

00:51:16.873 --> 00:51:18.442
ALSO HOW SHOULD LARGE SCALE

00:51:18.508 --> 00:51:20.510
REFORMS BE PHASED IN TO ENSURE

00:51:20.577 --> 00:51:21.011
THAT THEIR OPERATIONALLY

00:51:21.077 --> 00:51:22.379
FEASIBLE AND THAT THE MOST

00:51:22.446 --> 00:51:24.714
UNDERSERVED STUDENTS ARE

00:51:24.781 --> 00:51:26.917
PRIORITIZE AT EACH STEP.

00:51:26.983 --> 00:51:28.452
WE SEE THAT THESE IMPORTANT

00:51:28.518 --> 00:51:29.019
QUESTIONS THAT WARRANT SOME

00:51:29.085 --> 00:51:29.920
FOCUS.

00:51:29.986 --> 00:51:31.288
AND YET IT'S ALSO TRUE THAT THE

00:51:31.354 --> 00:51:32.789
STATE CANNOT WAIT UNTIL ALL THE

00:51:32.856 --> 00:51:34.291
WE HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS --

00:51:34.357 --> 00:51:35.459
TO ACT.

00:51:35.525 --> 00:51:36.693
CURRENTLY FEWER THAN HALF OF

00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:38.462
STUDENTS TO APPLY FOR CAL GRANTS

00:51:38.528 --> 00:51:39.629
AND MEET THE ELIGIBILITY

00:51:39.696 --> 00:51:42.132
CRITERIA RECEIVE GRANTS AND MOST

00:51:42.199 --> 00:51:43.800
WHO ARE TURNED AWAY HAVEN'T EFC

00:51:43.867 --> 00:51:46.203
AND EXPECTED FAMILY CONTRIBUTION

00:51:46.269 --> 00:51:48.338
OF ZERO EVEN THOSE HE GETS

00:51:48.405 --> 00:51:49.906
GRANTS COVER JUST STRUGGLE TO

00:51:49.973 --> 00:51:50.640
COVER THEIR COSTS.

00:51:50.707 --> 00:51:52.909
I'M IN THAT LETTER FROM YOU SEE

00:51:52.976 --> 00:51:54.544
PRESENT ALL THE TIME AND CSU

00:51:54.611 --> 00:51:55.412
CHANCELLOR.

00:51:55.479 --> 00:51:56.513
WHITE THAT MISTER SIMON

00:51:56.580 --> 00:51:58.014
REFERENCED --

00:51:58.081 --> 00:51:58.582
THOSE LEADERS POINTED TO THE

00:51:58.648 --> 00:52:01.651
NEED HOW GRANT ELIGIBILITY BEARS

00:52:01.718 --> 00:52:02.853
AN INCREASE THE CAL GRANT BE

00:52:02.919 --> 00:52:04.354
ACCESS AWARD IN THOSE ARE IN

00:52:04.421 --> 00:52:05.322
LINE WITH RECOMMENDATIONS WE'VE

00:52:05.388 --> 00:52:06.089
MADE.

00:52:06.156 --> 00:52:07.224
THE CALIFORNIANS FOR CALL OF

00:52:07.290 --> 00:52:08.391
COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY OF MADE

00:52:08.458 --> 00:52:09.426
AND THE CALIFORNIA HIGHER

00:52:09.493 --> 00:52:10.794
EDUCATION BASIC NEEDS ALLIANCE

00:52:10.861 --> 00:52:11.661
HAVE MADE.

00:52:11.728 --> 00:52:13.330
MAKING A SIZEABLE DOWN PAYMENT

00:52:13.396 --> 00:52:14.664
TOWARDS THESE ENDS THIS YEAR

00:52:14.731 --> 00:52:16.299
WITH THE TIMELINE FOR ADDITIONAL

00:52:16.366 --> 00:52:17.801
INVESTMENTS IN FUTURE YEARS.

00:52:17.868 --> 00:52:19.102
IS THE LEAST OF THE STATE CAN

00:52:19.169 --> 00:52:20.570
DEAR WHAT TO CAPITALIZE ON THE

00:52:20.637 --> 00:52:22.472
MOMENTUM AND RELATIVE CONSENSUS

00:52:22.539 --> 00:52:23.540
ON A POLICY ISSUE.

00:52:23.607 --> 00:52:24.975
THAT'S SO CRITICAL TO THE

00:52:25.041 --> 00:52:26.009
STATE'S FUTURE.

00:52:26.076 --> 00:52:27.511
NOT BROADER REFORM IS ABSOLUTELY

00:52:27.577 --> 00:52:28.612
WARRANTED --

00:52:28.678 --> 00:52:29.479
BUT AT A TIME WHEN THERE'S SO

00:52:29.546 --> 00:52:30.847
MUCH AGREEMENT ON WHAT OUR NORTH

00:52:30.914 --> 00:52:32.749
STAR SHOULD BE THE WORST OUTCOME

00:52:32.816 --> 00:52:34.184
AT THIS POINT WOULD BE FOR THE

00:52:34.251 --> 00:52:35.752
STATE TO FAIL TO MAKE PROGRESS

00:52:35.819 --> 00:52:37.020
TOWARDS IT.

00:52:37.087 --> 00:52:38.722
BECAUSE WE SPENT SO MUCH TIME

00:52:38.788 --> 00:52:40.290
STUDYING THE ROADMAP.

00:52:40.357 --> 00:52:41.124
SO WHETHER THROUGH BROADENING

00:52:41.191 --> 00:52:42.959
THE REGION SCOPE OF CAL GRANTS

00:52:43.026 --> 00:52:43.960
UNDER THE PROGRAM'S CURRENT

00:52:44.027 --> 00:52:45.462
STRUCTURE OR SORTING OUT THE

00:52:45.529 --> 00:52:46.830
DETAILS OF WHAT A NEW STRUCTURE

00:52:46.897 --> 00:52:51.134
COULD LOOK LIKE THE STATE CANNOT

00:52:51.201 --> 00:52:51.501
AFFORD TO WAIT.

00:52:51.568 --> 00:52:53.803
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

00:52:53.870 --> 00:52:54.137

EVERYBODY THIS MORNING --

00:53:12.689 --> 00:53:15.458
QUESTIONS FOR THIS PANEL.

00:53:15.525 --> 00:53:17.460
ALL START OUT THEN.

00:53:17.527 --> 00:53:18.628
YEAH.

00:53:18.695 --> 00:53:19.262
I WANT TO JUST YOU YOU ALL KIND

00:53:19.329 --> 00:53:24.100
OF PLENTY OF REMEDIES THAT WE

00:53:24.167 --> 00:53:25.835
COULD FOCUS ON THE GAPS OF

00:53:25.902 --> 00:53:27.938
STUDENTS TONIGHT I THINK THIS IS

00:53:28.004 --> 00:53:29.339
AMAZING JUST TO POINT OUT AGAIN.

00:53:29.406 --> 00:53:30.640
THE PEOPLE GET LOST TO FIND A WE

00:53:30.707 --> 00:53:32.609
DO HAVE THIS AMAZING CAL GRANT

00:53:32.676 --> 00:53:32.876
PROGRAM.

00:53:32.943 --> 00:53:34.377
WE DO HAVE --

00:53:34.444 --> 00:53:36.680
THESE ELIGIBILITY LIMITS AND SO

00:53:36.746 --> 00:53:40.050
YOU COULD BE A STUDENT WHO MAKES

00:53:40.116 --> 00:53:40.617
FIFTY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS

00:53:40.684 --> 00:53:42.786
YOUR FAMILY AND HAS A GPA.

00:53:42.852 --> 00:53:44.688
OF TWO POINT NINE AND YOU WOULD

00:53:44.754 --> 00:53:46.556
GET NO CAL GRANT AID FOR YOU CAN

00:53:46.623 --> 00:53:47.924
MAKE A THOUSAND DOLLARS LESS

00:53:47.991 --> 00:53:50.493
THAN A GPA OF TWO POINT.

00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:51.695
FOUR AND GET THAT THEY KEPT THE

00:53:51.761 --> 00:53:53.763
CAL GRANT BE AWARD AND SO WE

00:53:53.830 --> 00:53:54.864
JUST HAVE THIS.

00:53:54.931 --> 00:53:55.732
WITH THE CALL THE DONUT HOLE

00:53:55.799 --> 00:53:57.233
WHATEVER THESE THESE GAPS OF

00:53:57.300 --> 00:53:59.202
PEOPLE ARE JUST MISSING OUT --

00:53:59.269 --> 00:54:00.370
THEN WE HAVE STUDENTS WHO

00:54:00.437 --> 00:54:01.838
GRADUATE JUST A TREMENDOUS

00:54:01.905 --> 00:54:03.673
AMOUNT OF DEBT.

00:54:03.740 --> 00:54:04.641
AND WE HAVE CITIES DON'T GET ON

00:54:04.708 --> 00:54:05.542
ALL BECAUSE THE COMPETITIVE

00:54:05.609 --> 00:54:09.446
PIECES SO I GUESS MY POINT IS AS

00:54:09.512 --> 00:54:10.914
WE HAVE ALL OF THESE.

00:54:10.981 --> 00:54:12.215
PIECES THAT WE CAN TACKLE WE

00:54:12.282 --> 00:54:14.684
JUST WE WE HAVE A NICE ROAD MAP.

00:54:14.751 --> 00:54:16.186
BUT I THINK IT'S UP TO US TO OUR

00:54:16.252 --> 00:54:17.787
BUDGET COMMITTEE PROCESS IS

00:54:17.854 --> 00:54:19.456
SOMEWHAT PRIORITIZE.

00:54:19.522 --> 00:54:21.992
AND SO WE DON'T HAVE UNLIMITED

00:54:22.058 --> 00:54:23.226
RESOURCES.

00:54:23.293 --> 00:54:25.095
MAYBE ASK THE PANEL WHAT DO YOU

00:54:25.161 --> 00:54:26.696
THINK ARE THE MOST --

00:54:26.763 --> 00:54:28.231
APPROPRIATE PLACES TO START NOT

00:54:28.298 --> 00:54:29.699
JUST THE LOW HANGING FRUIT AS

00:54:29.766 --> 00:54:31.101
FAR AS COST.

00:54:31.167 --> 00:54:34.938
BUT YOU KNOW ANY OF THE GLASS --

00:54:35.005 --> 00:54:35.805
PROBLEMS THAT WE SHOULD BE

00:54:35.872 --> 00:54:38.074
ADDRESSING RIGHT AWAY.

00:54:38.141 --> 00:54:44.414
SO WHOEVER WANTS TO BEGIN.

00:54:44.481 --> 00:54:46.349
I'M OF START THANK YOU --

00:54:46.416 --> 00:54:48.585
FOR STARTING OUT WITH AN EASY

00:54:48.652 --> 00:54:50.820
QUESTION ASSEMBLY MEMBER.

00:54:50.887 --> 00:54:53.390
CHRISSY ABOUT --

00:54:53.456 --> 00:54:54.024
ONE FROM THE STUDENT AID

00:54:54.090 --> 00:54:54.658
COMMISSIONS PERSPECTIVE I THINK

00:54:54.724 --> 00:54:56.993
THAT IF THE STATE WERE TO START

00:54:57.060 --> 00:54:58.762
OUT BY PUTTING WILL --

00:54:58.828 --> 00:54:59.162
WHAT I BELIEVE THE

00:54:59.229 --> 00:55:00.230
ADMINISTRATION IT'S BECAUSE LIKE

00:55:00.296 --> 00:55:01.398
TO CALL A DOWN PAYMENT?

00:55:01.464 --> 00:55:03.700
ON SOME SORT OF OVER ARCHING

00:55:03.767 --> 00:55:04.401
FINANCIALLY --

00:55:04.467 --> 00:55:06.169
FORM I THINK.

00:55:06.236 --> 00:55:07.904
IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO FIND A

00:55:07.971 --> 00:55:09.272
BALANCE BETWEEN.

00:55:09.339 --> 00:55:11.741
SORT OF THE WHAT WE INTERNALLY

00:55:11.808 --> 00:55:14.444
CALL THE DEPTH VERSES BREATH

00:55:14.511 --> 00:55:16.012
CONVERSATION OR YOU KNOW MAY

00:55:16.079 --> 00:55:17.580
BOTH ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THERE

00:55:17.647 --> 00:55:18.314
ARE.

00:55:18.381 --> 00:55:19.849
A LOT OF STUDENTS THAT ARE LEFT

00:55:19.916 --> 00:55:21.184
OUT OF THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM

00:55:21.251 --> 00:55:22.218
BECAUSE WE DON'T GET ANY COVER

00:55:22.285 --> 00:55:23.219
AND IT ALL BECAUSE THE

00:55:23.286 --> 00:55:24.087
ELIGIBILITY BEARS THAT ARE IN

00:55:24.154 --> 00:55:24.788
PLACE.

00:55:24.854 --> 00:55:26.189
BUT ALSO THAT THERE ARE QUITE A

00:55:26.256 --> 00:55:27.590
LOT OF STUDENTS IN THE PROGRAM

00:55:27.657 --> 00:55:29.426
THAT DON'T GET ENOUGH AID

00:55:29.492 --> 00:55:30.560
WHETHER IT'S THROUGH THE CAL

00:55:30.627 --> 00:55:31.928
GRANT BE ACCESS WERE NOT HAVING

00:55:31.995 --> 00:55:33.396
GONE UP --

00:55:33.463 --> 00:55:35.565
OR YOU KNOW OR OTHER PLACES LIKE

00:55:35.632 --> 00:55:36.833
THE THE SO SO CALLED DOUGHNUT

00:55:36.900 --> 00:55:38.101
HOLE THAT YOU MENTIONED.

00:55:38.168 --> 00:55:40.236
SO I THINK THAT FROM OUR

00:55:40.303 --> 00:55:41.638
PERSPECTIVE WITHOUT SORT OF

00:55:41.705 --> 00:55:44.941
SAYING ONE POLICY ONE BILLS

00:55:45.008 --> 00:55:46.409
BETTER THAN THE OTHER I THINK.

00:55:46.476 --> 00:55:47.777
WE WOULD JUST --

00:55:47.844 --> 00:55:48.645
TO LEGISLATURE AND STAKEHOLDERS

00:55:48.712 --> 00:55:50.647
TO CONSIDER THAT THERE ARE A LOT

00:55:50.714 --> 00:55:52.115
OF STUDENTS IN BOTH GROUPS IT'S

00:55:52.182 --> 00:55:53.216
IT'S WE WOULD SAY IT'S PROBABLY

00:55:53.283 --> 00:55:55.351
NOT ENOUGH TO JUST EXPAND

00:55:55.418 --> 00:55:56.252
ELIGIBILITY AND GET MORE

00:55:56.319 --> 00:55:57.454
STUDENTS IN THE PROGRAM.

00:55:57.520 --> 00:55:58.555
BUT IT'S ALSO NOT ENOUGH TO JUST

00:55:58.621 --> 00:56:01.891
INCREASE THE OUR PROGRAM BECAUSE

00:56:01.958 --> 00:56:02.559
THAT STILL IS A LOT OF STUDENTS

00:56:02.625 --> 00:56:04.027
LEFT OUT SO SOME TYPE OF

00:56:04.094 --> 00:56:05.595
BALANCED APPROACH IN THAT COULD

00:56:05.662 --> 00:56:06.896
BE -- IT'S

00:56:06.963 --> 00:56:08.498
NOT A SYSTEMIC REFORM THAT COULD

00:56:08.565 --> 00:56:09.666
BE FOR EXAMPLE INCREASING THE

00:56:09.733 --> 00:56:10.567
NUMBER OF COMPETITIVE CAL GRANT

00:56:10.633 --> 00:56:12.802
AWARDS WHILE ALSO INCREASING THE

00:56:12.869 --> 00:56:13.603
CAL GRANT.

00:56:13.670 --> 00:56:14.971
BE ACCESS AWARD.

00:56:15.038 --> 00:56:15.805
THAT WOULD BE ONE APPROACH THAT

00:56:15.872 --> 00:56:17.140
WOULD BOTH DO BOTH OF THOSE

00:56:17.207 --> 00:56:18.641
THINGS AT ONCE BUT THAT DOESN'T

00:56:18.708 --> 00:56:19.976
GET TO THE SYSTEMIC ISSUES OF

00:56:20.043 --> 00:56:20.810
THE HEART THE PROGRAM THAT YOU

00:56:20.877 --> 00:56:22.212
REFERENCE AND THAT THE OTHER

00:56:22.278 --> 00:56:26.483
PAYMENTS OF REFERENCE SO --

00:56:26.549 --> 00:56:30.653
THAT'S ALSO IMPORTANT --

00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:31.588
YOU KNOW I THINK THE NUMBER ONE

00:56:31.654 --> 00:56:32.889
PRIORITY NEEDS TO BE HEALTHY

00:56:32.956 --> 00:56:35.258
MORE STUDENTS GET FINANCIAL AID --

00:56:35.325 --> 00:56:35.859
YOU KNOW I THINK THERE'S A BUT

00:56:35.925 --> 00:56:37.494
THERE IS AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE

00:56:37.560 --> 00:56:39.295
THAT COMES ALONG SIDE OF THAT

00:56:39.362 --> 00:56:40.630
RECEIPT OF A GRANT AND WE CAN DO

00:56:40.697 --> 00:56:41.598
MORE TO CAPITALIZE ON THE

00:56:41.664 --> 00:56:43.466
MESSAGE THAT WE THAT WE SEND

00:56:43.533 --> 00:56:44.601
WHEN WE SEND A STUDENT AWARD

00:56:44.667 --> 00:56:45.668
LETTER SAYING THAT THEY GET A

00:56:45.735 --> 00:56:46.302
CAL GRANT.

00:56:46.369 --> 00:56:47.837
IN FACT SOME OF THE PAPERS --

00:56:47.904 --> 00:56:49.405
IN THE COMPENDIUM THAT I SHARED

00:56:49.472 --> 00:56:50.240
WITH YOU --

00:56:50.306 --> 00:56:51.574
TALK ABOUT WAYS THAT WE CAN

00:56:51.641 --> 00:56:52.776
IMPROVE THE COMMUNICATIONS OF

00:56:52.842 --> 00:56:53.743
CAL GRANT AND I THINK THERE'S

00:56:53.810 --> 00:56:55.078
REALLY THERE'S REAL GAINS WE

00:56:55.145 --> 00:56:56.212
COULD BE MAKING BY THINKING

00:56:56.279 --> 00:56:57.514
ABOUT THAT AND THE UNIVERSITY OF

00:56:57.580 --> 00:56:58.848
MICHIGAN REFERENCE.

00:56:58.915 --> 00:57:00.083
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN --

00:57:00.150 --> 00:57:03.052
RESEARCH EMPHASIZES THAT --

00:57:03.119 --> 00:57:04.287
SO I THINK THAT THAT IS I THINK

00:57:04.354 --> 00:57:05.655
THAT'S IMPORTANT THE MESSAGING

00:57:05.722 --> 00:57:07.223
PEACE BUT IT ALSO WE HAVE TO GET

00:57:07.290 --> 00:57:09.192
MORE STUDENTS INTO THE DOOR --

00:57:09.259 --> 00:57:10.160
WE HAVE TO GET TWO MORE STUDENTS

00:57:10.226 --> 00:57:12.095
INTO THE DOOR WITH FINANCIAL AID --

00:57:12.162 --> 00:57:14.264
THERE ARE SO MANY STUDENTS --

00:57:14.330 --> 00:57:15.965
AT THE PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS AS

00:57:16.032 --> 00:57:17.667
WELL AS NONPROFIT THAT ARE BEING

00:57:17.734 --> 00:57:19.602
LEFT OUT CURRENTLY --

00:57:19.669 --> 00:57:21.971
AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES --

00:57:22.038 --> 00:57:24.674
YOU KNOW WHICH RECEIVE A VERY OF

00:57:24.741 --> 00:57:26.509
CAL GRANT SPENDING DESPITE AND

00:57:26.576 --> 00:57:28.211
ROLLING THE VAST MAJORITY OF

00:57:28.278 --> 00:57:30.113
UNDERGRADUATES IN THE STATE --

00:57:30.180 --> 00:57:31.214
THERE'S ACTUALLY ADDITIONAL

00:57:31.281 --> 00:57:32.715
FINANCIAL AID PROGRAMS THAT ARE

00:57:32.782 --> 00:57:34.584
AVAILABLE AS ADD ONS TO THE CAL

00:57:34.651 --> 00:57:35.685
GRANT RIGHT THERE'S THAT THE

00:57:35.752 --> 00:57:37.020
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDED

00:57:37.086 --> 00:57:38.087
PROGRAMS THERE.

00:57:38.154 --> 00:57:39.189
AND SO THE MORE STUDENTS WE

00:57:39.255 --> 00:57:40.523
ACTUALLY GET IN THE DOOR WITH

00:57:40.590 --> 00:57:41.591
CAL GRANTS.

00:57:41.658 --> 00:57:43.126
THE MORE OPPORTUNITY THEY HAVE

00:57:43.193 --> 00:57:44.460
TO ALSO LEVERAGE THAT OTHER

00:57:44.527 --> 00:57:45.795
FINANCIAL AID SO I WOULD SAY

00:57:45.862 --> 00:57:47.497
THAT HAS TO BE A KEY PRIORITY

00:57:47.564 --> 00:57:48.631
BUT I WOULD ALSO ECHO THE

00:57:48.698 --> 00:57:49.799
COMMENTS ABOUT THE CAL GRANT THE

00:57:49.866 --> 00:57:51.234
AXIS AWARD --

00:57:51.301 --> 00:57:54.404
NEEDING TO INCREASE AS WELL.

00:57:54.470 --> 00:57:55.171
DO YOU HAVE A THOUGHTLESSNESS

00:57:55.238 --> 00:57:57.073
RETIREMENT SURE.

00:57:57.140 --> 00:57:58.875
ODD SO I I'VE BIRD WATCHING THIS

00:57:58.942 --> 00:57:59.509
PROCESS AND BEING A PART OF THE

00:57:59.576 --> 00:58:00.577
LAST OF IT FOR THE LAST COUPLE

00:58:00.643 --> 00:58:03.112
OF YEARS I SEE KIND OF A MAYBE

00:58:03.179 --> 00:58:04.247
IT'S SORT OF A CHICKEN AND EGG

00:58:04.314 --> 00:58:05.915
KIND OF PROBLEM WHERE.

00:58:05.982 --> 00:58:07.317
WE CAN IMAGINE THESE GRAND

00:58:07.383 --> 00:58:09.152
REFORMS BUT THEY COST A LOT OF

00:58:09.219 --> 00:58:11.120
MONEY SO WE DON'T DO ANYTHING

00:58:11.187 --> 00:58:13.189
IMMEDIATELY --

00:58:13.256 --> 00:58:14.858
YET THE THING WE CAN DO

00:58:14.924 --> 00:58:16.125
IMMEDIATELY IS IN THE BUDGET

00:58:16.192 --> 00:58:18.528
PROCESS PUTTING MORE MONEY INTO

00:58:18.595 --> 00:58:19.495
SOMETHING SO.

00:58:19.562 --> 00:58:20.697
I LIKE THE DIRECTION THAT THE

00:58:20.763 --> 00:58:23.433
COMMITTEES ARE GOING WHERE THE

00:58:23.499 --> 00:58:25.235
IDEA OF KIND OF LAYING OUT WHAT

00:58:25.301 --> 00:58:26.836
ARE ALL OF THE THINGS WE WANT TO

00:58:26.903 --> 00:58:29.372
DO OVER A FOUR YEAR FIVE YEAR

00:58:29.439 --> 00:58:30.740
PERIOD --

00:58:30.807 --> 00:58:33.076
AND THEN IDENTIFYING THE STEPS

00:58:33.142 --> 00:58:34.711
TO GET THERE NOW FORTUNATELY WE

00:58:34.777 --> 00:58:35.612
HAVE.

00:58:35.678 --> 00:58:38.548
A GENERALLY GOOD STRUCTURE RIGHT

00:58:38.615 --> 00:58:43.553
NOW BUT WITH A LOT OF GAPS SO --

00:58:43.620 --> 00:58:47.090
BEGINNING TO FILL ONE WITH SOME

00:58:47.156 --> 00:58:48.858
ADDITIONAL FUNDING IS COMPLETELY

00:58:48.925 --> 00:58:52.662
CONSISTENT WITH A LONG TERM --

00:58:52.729 --> 00:58:55.231
LARGER REFORM PLAN AND LAYING

00:58:55.298 --> 00:58:56.933
OUT THAT LONGER PLAN CAN MAKE IT

00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:58.868
CLEARER WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN NEXT

00:58:58.935 --> 00:59:00.770
YEAR AND THE YEAR AFTER THAT I

00:59:00.837 --> 00:59:01.971
THINK -- IS

00:59:02.038 --> 00:59:04.140
COCHRAN'S IDEA OF MORE MONEY IN

00:59:04.207 --> 00:59:05.408
THE COMPETITIVE GRANT PROGRAM

00:59:05.475 --> 00:59:07.610
JUST GETTING MORE STUDENTS --

00:59:07.677 --> 00:59:09.379
FUNDED --

00:59:09.445 --> 00:59:12.582
WOULD BE AT UP THE GREAT WAY TO

00:59:12.649 --> 00:59:15.285
A GREAT WAY TO START --

00:59:15.351 --> 00:59:17.253
YOU COULD ALSO LOOK AT HOW MUCH

00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:18.988
RESOURCES CAN WE AFFORD THIS

00:59:19.055 --> 00:59:21.291
YEAR TO ADD INTO THE CAL GRANT

00:59:21.357 --> 00:59:22.625
PROGRAM AND WHICH OF THE

00:59:22.692 --> 00:59:24.327
BARRIERS DOES THAT MAKE FOR A

00:59:24.394 --> 00:59:25.662
GOOD FIT.

00:59:25.728 --> 00:59:27.397
YOU KNOW IS THAT THE GPA IS THAT

00:59:27.463 --> 00:59:29.299
THE AGES IT TIME OUT OF SCHOOL

00:59:29.365 --> 00:59:30.633
IS IT SOMETHING ELSE --

00:59:30.700 --> 00:59:32.502
SO I GET IT I I COULD SEE EITHER

00:59:32.568 --> 00:59:33.937
WAY BUT BUT EITHER WAY IT WOULD

00:59:34.003 --> 00:59:35.705
SEND IT WOULD.

00:59:35.772 --> 00:59:37.740
BE A START TOWARD FILLING THE

00:59:37.807 --> 00:59:40.944
GAPS OVERTIME AND ENDING UP WITH

00:59:41.010 --> 00:59:42.245
A DEBT FREE COLLEGE SYSTEM.

00:59:42.312 --> 00:59:43.479
SO A FOLLOW UP ON THAT I THINK I

00:59:43.546 --> 00:59:44.981
ASK MISS COCHRAN THIS QUESTION

00:59:45.048 --> 00:59:47.083
LAST YEAR AND AND YOU DIDN'T

00:59:47.150 --> 00:59:48.217
LIKE IT SO.

00:59:48.284 --> 00:59:49.619
LAST YEAR AGAIN SO THEN THE

00:59:49.686 --> 00:59:51.654
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET HE HAS ABOUT A

00:59:51.721 --> 00:59:53.122
HUNDRED MILLION --

00:59:53.189 --> 00:59:55.458
TO EXPAND CAL GRANT A DIFFERENT

00:59:55.525 --> 00:59:57.293
IDEA THAT WE HAD BUT STILL NOT

00:59:57.360 --> 00:59:58.795
NOT A BAD ONE TO HELP BEING.

00:59:58.861 --> 01:00:00.330
COLLEGE STUDENTS WHO ARE PARENTS

01:00:00.396 --> 01:00:02.498
AND DOING A ADD ON TO THEIR CAL

01:00:02.565 --> 01:00:05.435
GRANT PLUS HOW YOU CALL IT --

01:00:05.501 --> 01:00:06.936
IT SO IT IF IT GETS KIND THE

01:00:07.003 --> 01:00:08.171
ADAGE THAT YOU WOULD YOU RATHER

01:00:08.237 --> 01:00:09.505
HAVE MORE PEOPLE GETTING INTO

01:00:09.572 --> 01:00:10.773
COLLEGE GETTING SOME EIGHT OR

01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:11.374
HAVING.

01:00:11.441 --> 01:00:12.742
THOSE WHERE THEIR GRADUATE WITH

01:00:12.809 --> 01:00:14.711
LESS DEBT SO IF YOU HAD A

01:00:14.777 --> 01:00:16.479
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS SUITCASE

01:00:16.546 --> 01:00:18.448
RIGHT HERE WOULD YOU RATHER HELP

01:00:18.514 --> 01:00:21.384
OUR CAL GRANT RECIPIENTS WITH

01:00:21.451 --> 01:00:24.687
THE WITH THE THE PLUS.

01:00:24.754 --> 01:00:25.822
WITHOUT YOU CALLED YEAH CAL

01:00:25.888 --> 01:00:28.424
GRANT PLOW GRANT PLUS OR GIVE

01:00:28.491 --> 01:00:29.559
MORE AWARDS TO THE PEOPLE IN THE

01:00:29.625 --> 01:00:31.427
DOUGHNUT HOLE OR THE COMPETITIVE

01:00:31.494 --> 01:00:32.829
WHO WHO ARE.

01:00:32.895 --> 01:00:36.632
GETTING A CHANCE RIGHT NOW.

01:00:36.699 --> 01:00:38.935
WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

01:00:39.002 --> 01:00:39.502
IF WE HAD A HUNDRED MILLION

01:00:39.569 --> 01:00:44.707
DOLLARS -- I

01:00:44.774 --> 01:00:46.242
ASSUME I'M NOT ALLOWED TO SPLIT

01:00:46.309 --> 01:00:49.312
THE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS LIKE.

01:00:49.379 --> 01:00:50.113
FIFTY FIFTY OKAY I THINK I WOULD

01:00:50.179 --> 01:00:51.247
PROBABLY DO SOME SORT OF

01:00:51.314 --> 01:00:52.715
COMBINATION BUT I WOULD HAVE TO

01:00:52.782 --> 01:00:54.517
SAY IN TERMS OF THAT --

01:00:54.584 --> 01:00:56.152
YOU KNOW WHEN WE LOOK AT WHERE

01:00:56.219 --> 01:00:57.353
STUDENTS ARE BEING LEFT BEHIND

01:00:57.420 --> 01:00:58.521
AND WHERE SOME OF THE GREATEST

01:00:58.588 --> 01:01:00.189
AFFORDABILITY CHALLENGES OUR OUR

01:01:00.256 --> 01:01:01.424
RESEARCH CONSISTENTLY POINTS

01:01:01.491 --> 01:01:02.692
BACK TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES

01:01:02.759 --> 01:01:03.726
IS NOT TO SAY THAT THOSE ARE THE

01:01:03.793 --> 01:01:05.128
ONLY PROBLEMS BUT WE SEE

01:01:05.194 --> 01:01:06.462
SUBSTANTIAL PROBLEMS THERE AND I

01:01:06.529 --> 01:01:07.463
DO THINK THAT.

01:01:07.530 --> 01:01:08.064
THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT

01:01:08.131 --> 01:01:09.699
FUNDED FINANCIAL AID PROGRAMS

01:01:09.766 --> 01:01:10.500
HAVE BEEN A BIT OF A GAME

01:01:10.566 --> 01:01:11.701
CHANGER IN TERMS OF THAT

01:01:11.768 --> 01:01:13.069
EQUATION --

01:01:13.136 --> 01:01:14.837
RIGHT NOW STUDENTS WHO ARE

01:01:14.904 --> 01:01:15.738
ENROLLED IN THE COMMUNITY

01:01:15.805 --> 01:01:16.939
COLLEGES GETTING THE CAL GRANT

01:01:17.006 --> 01:01:18.307
AND YOU WERE TAKING FIFTEEN

01:01:18.374 --> 01:01:19.442
CREDITS A TERM.

01:01:19.509 --> 01:01:21.577
CAN GET QUITE A SIZEABLE BOOST

01:01:21.644 --> 01:01:23.012
IN THEIR CAL GRANT AWARD --

01:01:23.079 --> 01:01:24.947
THAT'S GREAT BUT THAT'S YOUR ONE

01:01:25.014 --> 01:01:26.449
OR 2% OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE

01:01:26.516 --> 01:01:28.751
STUDENTS THE WAY WE NEED TO WE

01:01:28.818 --> 01:01:29.886
<u>E CAN HELP MORE STUDENTS AS BY</u>

01:01:29.952 --> 01:01:32.388
GETTING MORE OF THEM CAL GRANTS.

01:01:32.455 --> 01:01:33.823
I'M IN LARGE IN THE BASE THAT

01:01:33.890 --> 01:01:36.592
WOULD BE ELIGIBLE GRAMS AND THEN

01:01:36.659 --> 01:01:38.161
WE WILL HELP MORE STUDENTS THAT

01:01:38.227 --> 01:01:39.996
WAY A CHEF AND LAST BEFORE I

01:01:40.063 --> 01:01:41.631
MOVE ON TO MISTER MEDINA.

01:01:41.697 --> 01:01:43.099
ON ON THE IN THE AGENDA THINGS

01:01:43.166 --> 01:01:44.500
ON PAGE FIVE WERE.

01:01:44.567 --> 01:01:46.803
WE LAY OUT ALL OF THE FINANCIAL

01:01:46.869 --> 01:01:48.704
AID AND IT'S NOT INSIGNIFICANCE

01:01:48.771 --> 01:01:51.107
TEN BILLION DOLLARS GOES OUT. TO

01:01:51.174 --> 01:01:52.575
STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA EVERY

01:01:52.642 --> 01:01:55.211
YEAR.

01:01:55.278 --> 01:01:57.747
RENDON ENOUGH. 40% OURSELVES

01:01:57.814 --> 01:01:58.381
FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THE

01:01:58.448 --> 01:01:58.681
PELL GRANT.

01:01:58.748 --> 01:01:59.315
WE DON'T ALWAYS TALK ABOUT THE

01:01:59.382 --> 01:02:02.618
UC AND CSU COMPONENTS AND THAT I

01:02:02.685 --> 01:02:04.320
ASSUME IS THAT THAT THAT TUITION

01:02:04.387 --> 01:02:06.489
THE THIRD THAT GOES BACK. TO

01:02:06.556 --> 01:02:07.824
RETURN TO AID.

01:02:07.890 --> 01:02:09.459
AND IT'S THEIR MONEY THEY THEY

01:02:09.525 --> 01:02:11.627
ADMINISTERED IT SEPARATE FROM

01:02:11.694 --> 01:02:14.130
OUR CALIFORNIA FINANCIAL AID

01:02:14.197 --> 01:02:15.665
SYSTEM THE TWO BILLION DOLLAR.

01:02:15.731 --> 01:02:17.400
PLUS PROGRAM AN ESTIMATE

01:02:17.467 --> 01:02:18.267
COMMISSION --

01:02:18.334 --> 01:02:20.069
SHOULD WE BE THINKING OF THAT

01:02:20.136 --> 01:02:21.704
DIFFERENTLY AS IN PUT IT

01:02:21.771 --> 01:02:23.106
AGGREGATE ALL TOGETHER.

01:02:23.172 --> 01:02:24.607
ARE WE DOING THE ****

01:02:24.674 --> 01:02:26.342
COORDINATED I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW

01:02:26.409 --> 01:02:28.711
YOU SEE IS LIKE THE MODEL WHERE

01:02:28.778 --> 01:02:30.813
THEY THEY PACKAGE MONEY AND SOME

01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:31.814
OF THE MONEY A PACKAGE IS

01:02:31.881 --> 01:02:34.016
STUDENTS CAL GRANT MONEY BUT

01:02:34.083 --> 01:02:35.084
THAT MONEY TOO SO.

01:02:35.151 --> 01:02:36.185
I KNOW I'M NOT SURE IF WE'RE

01:02:36.252 --> 01:02:40.323
ALWAYS THINKING ABOUT THAT IN

01:02:40.389 --> 01:02:42.325
THE BIG PICTURE WHAT HE SAID.

01:02:42.391 --> 01:02:42.859
I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE

01:02:42.925 --> 01:02:43.893
COORDINATION BETWEEN THE FUNDING

01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:46.929
THAT CAL GRANT FUNDING AND THE

01:02:46.996 --> 01:02:47.563
THE INSTITUTIONAL AID THAT COME

01:02:47.630 --> 01:02:52.034
FROM AND AND YOU COULD EVEN

01:02:52.101 --> 01:02:53.870
THINK ABOUT THAT IN THE CONTEXT

01:02:53.936 --> 01:02:55.771
OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED

01:02:55.838 --> 01:02:56.772
INCREASE --

01:02:56.839 --> 01:02:58.708
THAT IF THE GOVERNOR'S FUNDS FOR

01:02:58.774 --> 01:03:00.810
STUDENTS PARENTS WHERE SOME OF

01:03:00.877 --> 01:03:02.044
THOSE STUDENTS THOSE STUDENT

01:03:02.111 --> 01:03:05.114
PARENTS AT UC AND CSU.

01:03:05.181 --> 01:03:06.182
ARE.

01:03:06.249 --> 01:03:08.284
ARE ARE OR WOULD BE CURRENTLY

01:03:08.351 --> 01:03:09.552
ELIGIBLE FOR SOME OF THE

01:03:09.619 --> 01:03:11.087
INSTITUTIONAL AID THAT THE

01:03:11.154 --> 01:03:12.722
INSTITUTIONS ARE PROVIDING AND

01:03:12.788 --> 01:03:15.558
SO IN A WAY THE LEGISLATURE IS

01:03:15.625 --> 01:03:17.059
WE'RE LEAVING.

01:03:17.126 --> 01:03:19.162
THE UNIVERSITIES OF SOME OF THAT

01:03:19.228 --> 01:03:21.197
BURDEN AND THAT CAN START THE

01:03:21.264 --> 01:03:22.265
CONVERSATION --

01:03:22.331 --> 01:03:23.599
HOW DO WE DO A BETTER JOB OF

01:03:23.666 --> 01:03:24.934
SHARING DATA ABOUT WHERE THE

01:03:25.001 --> 01:03:26.702
NEEDS ARE AND HOW THEY ARE

01:03:26.769 --> 01:03:28.437
GETTING COVERED ONE WAY OR

01:03:28.504 --> 01:03:29.906
ANOTHER --

01:03:29.972 --> 01:03:31.440
AND AND THAT'S THE KIND OF

01:03:31.507 --> 01:03:33.876
PARTNERSHIP WE WE NEED BETWEEN

01:03:33.943 --> 01:03:35.511
SAID NAY COMMISSION AND THE

01:03:35.578 --> 01:03:38.047
SYSTEMS SO THAT WERE THINKING.

01:03:38.114 --> 01:03:40.049
FULL COST OF ATTENDANCE AND ALSO

01:03:40.116 --> 01:03:41.884
ALL STUDENTS --

01:03:41.951 --> 01:03:43.152
RATHER THAN AS KIND OF A LOW A

01:03:43.219 --> 01:03:44.954
LEVEL OF BLINDNESS NIGHT RIGHT

01:03:45.021 --> 01:03:48.224
NOW THAT THIS DID NAY COMMISSION

01:03:48.291 --> 01:03:49.859
HAS WHERE THEY FOR THE CAL GRANT

01:03:49.926 --> 01:03:50.860
MONEY OVER THERE FOR REALLY GOOD

01:03:50.927 --> 01:03:52.395
PURPOSES AND AND STUDENTS WHO.

01:03:52.461 --> 01:03:55.064
NEED IT BUT BUT THEN WHAT'S WHAT

01:03:55.131 --> 01:03:57.800
ELSE IS HAPPENING IS.

01:03:57.867 --> 01:03:59.535
A LOT OF IT IS AN UNKNOWN.

01:03:59.602 --> 01:04:00.536
DO YOU THINK IT SHOULD ALL BE

01:04:00.603 --> 01:04:02.038
UNDER ONE UMBRELLA I DON'T I

01:04:02.104 --> 01:04:03.573
KNOW THE UC AND CSU PROBABLY

01:04:03.639 --> 01:04:04.774
WOULDN'T LIKE IT.

01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:06.008
TO TAKE TO GET RID OF THAT MONEY

01:04:06.075 --> 01:04:07.643
BUT IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:04:07.710 --> 01:04:09.378
SIMPLIFYING IT AND MODERNIZING

01:04:09.445 --> 01:04:10.213
AND HAVING.

01:04:10.279 --> 01:04:11.280
YOU KNOW ONE PORTAL THAT LOOKS

01:04:11.347 --> 01:04:12.682
AT THE STUDENT THE NEED THE

01:04:12.748 --> 01:04:15.851
FAMILY CONTRIBUTION IT SEEMS

01:04:15.918 --> 01:04:16.385
SOMEONE ANY FISH AND THAT

01:04:16.452 --> 01:04:17.653
THERE'S THERE THAT PEOPLE HAVE

01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:18.654
TO GO TO DIFFERENT PLACES TO

01:04:18.721 --> 01:04:20.556
FIGURE IT OUT I THINK WE NEED A

01:04:20.623 --> 01:04:23.960
SYSTEM WHERE THE INSTEAD NAY

01:04:24.026 --> 01:04:26.128
COMMISSION AND THE CAMPUS.

01:04:26.195 --> 01:04:28.264
CLOSE ENOUGH FOR NATION THAT

01:04:28.331 --> 01:04:29.865
FROM THE STUDENTS PERSPECTIVE

01:04:29.932 --> 01:04:31.300
THEY CAN GET --

01:04:31.367 --> 01:04:34.036
THEY CAN GET THAT SIMPLIFIED

01:04:34.103 --> 01:04:37.039
INFORMATION BUT ESPECIALLY WITH

01:04:37.106 --> 01:04:38.841
WHEN IT RICK WHEN IT COMES TO

01:04:38.908 --> 01:04:40.509
THE BROADER COST OF ATTENDANCE

01:04:40.576 --> 01:04:42.478
WE HAVE FOUND THAT THERE ARE

01:04:42.545 --> 01:04:43.879
LOCALIZED.

01:04:43.946 --> 01:04:46.048
ISSUES THAT WHERE IT DOES MAKE

01:04:46.115 --> 01:04:47.450
SENSE FOR THE SEGMENTS OF THE

01:04:47.516 --> 01:04:49.752
CAMPUSES TO HAVE SOME DISCRETION

01:04:49.819 --> 01:04:51.320
OVER EXACTLY HOW TO HOW TO

01:04:51.387 --> 01:04:53.823
ALLOCATE FUNDS --

01:04:53.889 --> 01:04:55.358
AND USUALLY THOSE HAPPEN FAIRLY.

01:04:55.424 --> 01:04:56.359
LATE IN THE PROCESS ONCE

01:04:56.425 --> 01:04:57.860
DECISIONS AT ONCE THAT STUDENT

01:04:57.927 --> 01:05:00.329
IS ACTUALLY MADE A DECISION OF

01:05:00.396 --> 01:05:01.631
WHICH CAN'T WHAT CAMPUS I'M

01:05:01.697 --> 01:05:03.232
GOING TO WHAT IS MY LIVING

01:05:03.299 --> 01:05:04.800
SITUATION.

01:05:04.867 --> 01:05:05.601
THEY'RE GONNA BE SITUATIONS

01:05:05.668 --> 01:05:08.404
WHERE SOMEBODY HAVING MORE

01:05:08.471 --> 01:05:09.972
EXPENSIVE HOUSING --

01:05:10.039 --> 01:05:11.440
MAKES SENSE AND THEY'RE GONNA BE

01:05:11.507 --> 01:05:13.309
SITUATIONS WHERE MAYBE THAT'S

01:05:13.376 --> 01:05:15.011
NOT GOOD MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T BE

01:05:15.077 --> 01:05:16.646
INCENTIVIZING THAT AND THAT'S

01:05:16.712 --> 01:05:18.047
GOING TO BE A LOCALIZED SORT OF

01:05:18.114 --> 01:05:19.915
THING THAT THAT NEEDS TO BE

01:05:19.982 --> 01:05:22.952
ACCOUNTED FOR ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.

01:05:23.019 --> 01:05:24.287
OKAY THANK YOU MISTER MEDINA.

01:05:24.353 --> 01:05:28.157
THANK YOU --

01:05:28.224 --> 01:05:30.593
HANDLE ON THE DEPTH VERSES

01:05:30.660 --> 01:05:33.562
BREATH RIGHT DO WE GIVE MORE.

01:05:33.629 --> 01:05:35.331
MORE CAL GRANTS TO MORE

01:05:35.398 --> 01:05:37.066
INDIVIDUALS OR DO WE GIVE MORE

01:05:37.133 --> 01:05:39.435
MONEY TO A SMALLER GROUP OF

01:05:39.502 --> 01:05:42.238
INDIVIDUALS AND BOTH HAVE COST.

01:05:42.305 --> 01:05:45.808
AND AS WE LOOK TO TO READ --

01:05:45.875 --> 01:05:47.643
ELIMINATING THE BARRIERS AGE

01:05:47.710 --> 01:05:49.879
BARRIER THAT WE ELIMINATE ALSO

01:05:49.945 --> 01:05:51.213
HAS COSTS.

01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:53.616
AND SO IT IS UP TO I THINK THIS

01:05:53.683 --> 01:05:55.484
COMMITTEE AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:05:55.551 --> 01:05:57.620
MCCARTY MYSELF AS WE WORK ON THE

01:05:57.687 --> 01:06:00.356
BILL [inaudible] TO TO THINK

01:06:00.423 --> 01:06:02.758
ABOUT HOW.

01:06:02.825 --> 01:06:04.360
RIGHT OR WHICH BARRIERS ARE ARE

01:06:04.427 --> 01:06:06.329
EVEN MORE IMPORTANT I THINK

01:06:06.395 --> 01:06:07.797
THAT'S THE QUESTION --

01:06:07.863 --> 01:06:09.732
FROM ASSEMBLYMEMBER MCCARTY TO

01:06:09.799 --> 01:06:12.501
TRIED TO HELP THOSE PRIORITIZE.

01:06:12.568 --> 01:06:15.204
I AYE I HEARD ONE SUGGESTION OF

01:06:15.271 --> 01:06:16.939
THE LIMóN EIGHTEEN GPA --

01:06:17.006 --> 01:06:20.009
WAS AT A SUGGESTION THAT GPA --

01:06:20.076 --> 01:06:21.077
NOT BE --

01:06:21.143 --> 01:06:23.913
CONSIDER AT ALL AND RIGHT

01:06:23.979 --> 01:06:25.114
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THE IT'S KIND

01:06:25.181 --> 01:06:26.415
OF COMPLEX.

01:06:26.482 --> 01:06:27.183
RIGHT WHICH ONES [inaudible]

01:06:27.249 --> 01:06:29.218

QUALIFY FOR SO WAS A SUGGESTION

01:06:31.787 --> 01:06:35.424
NOT TO CONSIDER GPA AT ALL --

01:06:35.491 --> 01:06:36.625
IT SO FOR AT LEAST FOR THE

01:06:36.692 --> 01:06:40.262
PUBLIC SEGMENTS THAT THE TO GET

01:06:40.329 --> 01:06:41.430
SOMEBODY WHO GETS INTO UNIT

01:06:41.497 --> 01:06:44.133
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IS --

01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:45.568
MILEY ACADEMIC QUALIFY

01:06:45.634 --> 01:06:47.570
ACADEMICALLY QUALIFIED AND SO TO

01:06:47.636 --> 01:06:49.572
QUIBBLE OVER AT A TWO POINT NINE

01:06:49.638 --> 01:06:50.873
VERSUS THREE POINT OH IN THE

01:06:50.940 --> 01:06:52.508
QUESTION OF THE DAY TAKING AP

01:06:52.575 --> 01:06:54.210
CLASSES AND ALL OF THAT IS NOT

01:06:54.276 --> 01:06:55.044
REALLY --

01:06:55.111 --> 01:06:58.347
NECESSARY CSU IS SIMILAR --

01:06:58.414 --> 01:07:01.417
COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE MORE --

01:07:01.484 --> 01:07:05.054
BUT ENCOURAGING STUDENTS FROM

01:07:05.121 --> 01:07:06.689
WHATEVER BACKGROUND AND YET

01:07:06.756 --> 01:07:07.690
THERE'S A LOT OF STUDENTS A

01:07:07.757 --> 01:07:09.058
COMMUNITY COLLEGE YOU ARE FIVE

AND ARE MAKING A GO OF IT.

01:07:15.564 --> 01:07:20.169
AND GIVING THEM A CLEAR ROUTE

01:07:20.236 --> 01:07:22.271
FOR DOING SO --

01:07:22.338 --> 01:07:24.640
AT THE START WITH A STRONG

01:07:24.707 --> 01:07:26.809
FINANCIAL AID PACKAGE IS MOST

01:07:26.876 --> 01:07:29.111
LIKELY TO GET THEM TO THE FINISH

01:07:29.178 --> 01:07:30.212
LINE ULTIMATELY SO IF YOU'RE

01:07:30.279 --> 01:07:31.514
GOING TO BE TOUGH.

01:07:31.580 --> 01:07:35.184
ON ON A KIND OF GPA I WOULD DO

01:07:35.251 --> 01:07:36.786
IT AFTER THAT FIRST YEAR I WOULD

01:07:36.852 --> 01:07:39.355
SAY YES YOU GET FINANCIAL AID IN

01:07:39.422 --> 01:07:41.824
ROLE GO FULL TIME MAKE A GO OF

01:07:41.891 --> 01:07:43.893
IT -- BUT IF

01:07:43.959 --> 01:07:45.828
IF FROM A BUDGET STANDPOINT WERE

01:07:45.895 --> 01:07:47.062
ALL WERE WORRIED OR FROM A

01:07:47.129 --> 01:07:48.531
BI&lt;c.cyan&gt; STANDPOINT WERE WORRIED&lt;/c&gt;

01:07:48.597 --> 01:07:49.999
ABOUT PEOPLE SOMEHOW TAKING

01:07:50.065 --> 01:07:52.301
ADVANTAGE OR SOMETHING THEN I'D

01:07:52.368 --> 01:07:54.036
SAY GET TOUGH.

01:07:54.103 --> 01:07:55.571
FOR STRONGLY ENCOURAGED GET GET

01:07:55.638 --> 01:07:56.839
THINGS OUT OF THE WAY YOU KNOW

01:07:56.906 --> 01:07:57.973
GET GET OUT OF THE WAY THE WHOLE

01:07:58.040 --> 01:08:00.042
CONCEPT OF GOSH ALL HAVE.

01:08:00.109 --> 01:08:00.976
TO MY HIGH SCHOOL WASN'T THAT

01:08:01.043 --> 01:08:03.012
GOOD -- GET

01:08:03.078 --> 01:08:04.513
THAT OUT OF THE WAY COMPLETELY.

01:08:04.580 --> 01:08:06.215
AND IF YOU NEED TO GET TOUGH GET

01:08:06.282 --> 01:08:07.049
TOUGHER.

01:08:07.116 --> 01:08:10.186
AFTER THE FIRST SEMESTER AFTER

01:08:10.252 --> 01:08:13.456
THE FIRST YEAR THROUGH IT WOULD.

01:08:13.522 --> 01:08:14.857
CREATE A A SIMPLER.

01:08:14.924 --> 01:08:15.458
ABSOLUTELY SIMPLE ARE AND IT

01:08:15.524 --> 01:08:16.792
WOULD ELIMINATE THE ENORMOUS

01:08:16.859 --> 01:08:17.860
AMOUNT OF BACK AND FORTH RIGHT

01:08:17.927 --> 01:08:18.794
NOW -- WITH

01:08:18.861 --> 01:08:20.262
BETWEEN --

AND EVERYTHING WHICH ALL OF THAT

01:08:28.871 --> 01:08:31.740
STAFF TIME COULD BE USED --

01:08:31.807 --> 01:08:33.476
ACTUALLY HELPING STUDENTS FIGURE

01:08:33.542 --> 01:08:34.710
OUT THERE --

01:08:34.777 --> 01:08:36.011
THE FINANCIAL AID WHERE THEY

01:08:36.078 --> 01:08:37.313
COULD APPLY WHERE THEY COULD GO

01:08:37.379 --> 01:08:38.614
TO COLLEGE AND PUT SOMETHING IN

01:08:38.681 --> 01:08:39.782
LIKE YOU HAVE TO MAINTAIN A

01:08:39.849 --> 01:08:42.818

RIGHT NOT CHATTED ASKED WHICH

01:08:43.819 --> 01:08:45.287
MOST COLLEGES HALF SO JUST BE A

01:08:45.354 --> 01:08:48.057
MATTER OF MONITORING THAT AND

01:08:48.123 --> 01:08:48.624
MAYBE PUTTING SOME MINIMUMS

ON THAT I THINK AND THERE'S

01:08:57.933 --> 01:08:59.034
ALWAYS THE THOUGH OF THE HARD.

01:08:59.101 --> 01:09:00.469
DECISION MAKING THAT INVOLVES

01:09:00.536 --> 01:09:02.505
WHAT WE WOULD IDEALLY LIKE TO

01:09:02.571 --> 01:09:04.273
SEE VERSUS WHAT WE HAVE THE

01:09:04.340 --> 01:09:06.008
CAPACITY TO DO --

01:09:06.075 --> 01:09:08.043
AND CERTAINLY IT'S A POSITIVE

01:09:08.110 --> 01:09:09.578
YEAR WHEN THERE'S AN INCREASE

01:09:09.645 --> 01:09:12.882
BUT AS MAY BE PROJECTED IN THE

01:09:12.948 --> 01:09:14.316
COMING YEARS THAT INCREASE WON'T.

01:09:14.383 --> 01:09:16.051
MAY NOT BE THERE IF THE ECONOMY

01:09:16.118 --> 01:09:19.021
DOESN'T A SUSTAIN ITSELF SO

01:09:19.088 --> 01:09:20.589
ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA JUST

01:09:20.656 --> 01:09:22.958
TOUCHED ON THE GRADE ASPECT OF

01:09:23.025 --> 01:09:23.859
IT.

01:09:23.926 --> 01:09:25.694
OF ALL OF THE SUGGESTIONS YOU'VE

01:09:25.761 --> 01:09:27.062

01:09:27.129 --> 01:09:29.064
AGAIN CONSIDERING THAT SOME OUR

01:09:29.131 --> 01:09:32.835
CAPACITY ISSUES AND WHICH WHICH

01:09:32.902 --> 01:09:34.537
ACTUALLY YIELD THE GREATEST

01:09:34.603 --> 01:09:35.271
OUTCOMES.

01:09:35.337 --> 01:09:36.772
AND WHAT ARE THE GREATEST

01:09:36.839 --> 01:09:38.874
OUTCOME ARE THEY TIME TO DEGREE

01:09:38.941 --> 01:09:40.276
OR THE COMPLETION [inaudible]

01:09:40.342 --> 01:09:45.114
QUESTION.

01:09:45.180 --> 01:09:46.482
I THINK IT MIGHT DEPEND ON THE

01:09:46.549 --> 01:09:47.850
SIZE OF THE INVESTMENT --

01:09:47.917 --> 01:09:49.018
I GUESS THAT'S WHAT I WOULD HAVE

01:09:49.084 --> 01:09:50.252
TO SAY IS CERTAINLY THE RESEARCH

01:09:50.319 --> 01:09:51.787
IS PRETTY AS CLEAR THAT --

01:09:51.854 --> 01:09:53.355
FINANCIAL AID DOES SUPPORT

01:09:53.422 --> 01:09:54.290
STUDENTS AND ENROLLING IN

01:09:54.356 --> 01:09:55.858
COLLEGE COMPLETING COLLEGE AND

01:09:55.925 --> 01:09:57.159
SUPPORTING THEIR ABILITY TO TAKE

01:09:57.226 --> 01:09:57.927
MORE.

01:09:57.993 --> 01:10:02.431
COURSES PER TERM WHICH SPEAK AND

01:10:02.498 --> 01:10:04.867
SO I'M.

01:10:04.934 --> 01:10:07.202
I THINK IT'S IT'S HARD TO KNOW --

01:10:07.269 --> 01:10:09.104
YOU KNOW EXACTLY HOW MUCH HOW

01:10:09.171 --> 01:10:10.539
MUCH WE'RE TALKING MY OPPOSE A

01:10:10.606 --> 01:10:12.408
FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT

01:10:12.474 --> 01:10:12.975
HUNDRED TWO HUNDRED MILLION

01:10:13.042 --> 01:10:14.410
DOLLAR INVESTMENT IT MIGHT BE A

01:10:14.476 --> 01:10:17.680
BIT DIFFERENT ANSWER.

01:10:17.746 --> 01:10:18.714
PICK ONE AND TELL ME THE ANSWER.

01:10:18.781 --> 01:10:20.015
AT THE END IS TRYING TO GET A

01:10:20.082 --> 01:10:22.251
SENSE OF WHERE I MEAN.

01:10:22.318 --> 01:10:24.053
IF THE IF THE DECISIONS HAVE TO

01:10:24.119 --> 01:10:26.188
BE MADE I I DON'T I'M NOT CLEAR

01:10:26.255 --> 01:10:28.023
ON WHAT THE RECOMMENDATION IS --

01:10:28.090 --> 01:10:30.326
AND WHAT'S THE PRIORITY IS IS IT

01:10:30.392 --> 01:10:31.727
YOU KNOW TIME TO DEGREE IS A

01:10:31.794 --> 01:10:33.228
COMPLETION --

01:10:33.295 --> 01:10:34.530
WE JUST THERE WERE THERE WAS A

01:10:34.597 --> 01:10:36.165
SUGGESTION MADE ABOUT NOT

01:10:36.231 --> 01:10:37.700
CONSIDERING GPA IN THE FIRST

01:10:37.766 --> 01:10:40.002
SEMESTER QUARTER BUT CONSIDERING

01:10:40.069 --> 01:10:41.570
IT THERE AFTER --

01:10:41.637 --> 01:10:42.605
AND I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE

01:10:42.671 --> 01:10:44.073
OUT OF ALL OF THE SUGGESTIONS

01:10:44.139 --> 01:10:45.207
THAT HAVE BEEN MENTIONED THE

01:10:45.274 --> 01:10:46.842
LAST HOUR OR SO.

01:10:46.909 --> 01:10:49.712
WHICH IS GOING TO YIELD THE

01:10:49.778 --> 01:10:50.813
GREATER OUTCOME AND I AND YOU

01:10:50.879 --> 01:10:51.814
CAN PICK WHATEVER OUTCOME YOU

01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:53.182
WANT I'M JUST I WANT TO KNOW

01:10:53.248 --> 01:10:55.250
WHICH WOULD YIELD MOST TO

01:10:55.317 --> 01:10:57.753
ACHIEVE A CERTAIN OUTCOME.

01:10:57.820 --> 01:11:00.422
WHAT? ONE THING ARE.

01:11:00.489 --> 01:11:01.190
BUT AT THE TIME TO THINK ABOUT

01:11:01.256 --> 01:11:02.791
IS THAT.

01:11:02.858 --> 01:11:03.926
DEPENDING ON HOW THE PROGRAM IS

01:11:03.993 --> 01:11:05.327
STRUCTURED THE COULD BE A STATE

01:11:05.394 --> 01:11:07.029
GOLD LINKED TO THAT SO FOR

01:11:07.096 --> 01:11:07.763
EXAMPLE --

01:11:07.830 --> 01:11:08.797
ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY

01:11:08.864 --> 01:11:10.833
REFERENCE TO THE IDEA OF A DEBT

01:11:10.899 --> 01:11:13.335
FREE COLLEGE GRANT PROGRAM AND

01:11:13.402 --> 01:11:15.104
PRESUMABLY THE GOAL IS TO CREATE

01:11:15.170 --> 01:11:17.840
A SYSTEM WHERE STUDENTS DON'T

01:11:17.906 --> 01:11:20.175
HAVE TO RELY ON DEBT WHERE.

01:11:20.242 --> 01:11:21.877
IF THEY CAN WORK A CERTAIN

01:11:21.944 --> 01:11:23.746
AMOUNT OR IF THEY OR THEIR

01:11:23.812 --> 01:11:25.981
FAMILY ARE CAPABLE OF PUTTING A

01:11:26.048 --> 01:11:26.548
CERTAIN REASON WHAT FURTHER

01:11:26.615 --> 01:11:27.916
EDUCATION.

01:11:27.983 --> 01:11:29.284
THE YOU KNOW DEBT WOULD BE AN

01:11:29.351 --> 01:11:32.588
ABSOLUTE LACK STUDENT RIGHT SO

01:11:32.655 --> 01:11:34.156
THE MODEL THAT THE LA --

01:11:34.223 --> 01:11:35.591
RECOMMENDED THAT THE CENTURY

01:11:35.658 --> 01:11:36.959
FOUNDATION RECOMMENDED IN THE

01:11:37.026 --> 01:11:37.960
REPORT --

01:11:38.027 --> 01:11:39.528
AND THAT IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE

01:11:39.595 --> 01:11:41.463
MODEL THAT YOU SEE USES IN THEIR

01:11:41.530 --> 01:11:42.965
EDUCATION FINANCE MODEL --

01:11:43.032 --> 01:11:44.099
THAT YOU'LL HEAR ABOUT

01:11:44.166 --> 01:11:46.268
ESSENTIALLY SAYS IT PUTS A CAP

01:11:46.335 --> 01:11:47.503
ON THE STUDENTS EXPECTED

01:11:47.569 --> 01:11:48.871
CONTRIBUTION.

01:11:48.937 --> 01:11:50.873
RIGHT SO RIGHT NOW --

01:11:50.939 --> 01:11:51.940
ARE FINANCIALLY BONTA PUTS A CAP

01:11:52.007 --> 01:11:53.375
ON THE AMOUNT OF A TO GET SO IT

01:11:53.442 --> 01:11:54.243
DOESN'T MATTER HOW MUCH YOUR

01:11:54.309 --> 01:11:55.444
COST OF ATTENDANCE AS YOUR CAL

01:11:55.511 --> 01:11:57.346
GRANT IS CAPPED AT TAX DOLLARS

01:11:57.413 --> 01:11:58.781
DEPENDING ON SEGMENT.

01:11:58.847 --> 01:12:00.382
THE COST OF ATTENDANCE SORT OF

01:12:00.449 --> 01:12:02.551
DEBT FREE MODEL PUTS A CAP ON

01:12:02.618 --> 01:12:03.952
HOW MUCH THE STUDENT HAS TO PAY

01:12:04.019 --> 01:12:06.121
OUT OF POCKET AND THEREFORE SAYS

01:12:06.188 --> 01:12:07.356
IF YOU CAN BRING THIS AMOUNT TO

01:12:07.423 --> 01:12:08.524
THE TABLE THE REST OF YOUR COSTS

01:12:08.590 --> 01:12:09.692
OF TOWNS WILL BE COVERED.

01:12:09.758 --> 01:12:11.393
WHATEVER IT IS FROM FEDERAL

01:12:11.460 --> 01:12:13.829
STATE INSTITUTIONAL AID AND THEN

01:12:13.896 --> 01:12:16.365
NOT MODEL WITH THE GOAL IS.

01:12:16.432 --> 01:12:17.499
TO REDUCE STUDENT DEBT BY

01:12:17.566 --> 01:12:19.268
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT PARTICULARLY

01:12:19.334 --> 01:12:20.936
FOR LOW INCOME STUDENTS I THINK

01:12:21.003 --> 01:12:22.304
BUT THINK THERE BE MEASURABLE

01:12:22.371 --> 01:12:23.739
OUTCOMES THERE --

01:12:23.806 --> 01:12:25.574
AND ESPECIALLY IF THE GOAL IS TO

01:12:25.641 --> 01:12:27.142
MAKE IT SO THE STUDENTS HAVE TO

01:12:27.209 --> 01:12:28.343
RELY ON DEATH SO THAT A STUDENT

01:12:28.410 --> 01:12:29.945
WHO IS ABLE TO FIND SOME

01:12:30.012 --> 01:12:31.680
REASONABLE AMOUNT OF WORK HOURS

01:12:31.747 --> 01:12:33.048
OR HAD SOME FAMILY INCOME THEY

01:12:33.115 --> 01:12:36.018
CAN RELY ON DEBT IS NOT

01:12:36.085 --> 01:12:40.723
SOMETHING IN THE OF THE FIRST.

01:12:40.789 --> 01:12:41.356
YOU KNOW FIRST DAY THINKING ALL

01:12:41.423 --> 01:12:43.859
RIGHT I'M GOING TO COLLABORATION

01:12:43.926 --> 01:12:44.760
WITH THE CAL STATE TO

01:12:44.827 --> 01:12:46.495
DISSOCIATION LOOKING AT CSU

01:12:46.562 --> 01:12:47.262
GRADUATES AND THEIR STUDENT AT

01:12:47.329 --> 01:12:48.263
LEVELS.

01:12:48.330 --> 01:12:50.099
AND WANT ONE OF THE STARKEST

01:12:50.165 --> 01:12:51.166
MOUNTAINS AT FINDINGS THAT WE

01:12:51.233 --> 01:12:52.701
HAD WAS THAT EIGHT IN TEN CSU

01:12:52.768 --> 01:12:55.104
GRADS HAD FAMILY INCOMES UNDER

01:12:55.170 --> 01:12:56.538
ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS --

01:12:56.605 --> 01:12:58.040
SO IT IS THAT THAT IS VERY

01:12:58.107 --> 01:12:59.408
CLEARLY BEING DISPROPORTIONATELY

01:12:59.475 --> 01:13:00.943
HELD BY LOWER INCOME FAMILIES

01:13:01.009 --> 01:13:02.111
AND STUDENTS --

01:13:02.177 --> 01:13:03.712
THAT SIMILAR TRENDS --

01:13:03.779 --> 01:13:04.847
WE SEE FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF

01:13:04.913 --> 01:13:06.181
CALIFORNIA AND WE'RE DOING A

01:13:06.248 --> 01:13:07.950
SIMILAR ANALYSIS WITH THE UC

01:13:08.016 --> 01:13:09.151
STUDENT ASSOCIATION --

01:13:09.218 --> 01:13:11.386
THAT'S FORTHCOMING OF NEXT MONTH

01:13:11.453 --> 01:13:12.654
SO I THINK I WOULD ALSO SAY I

01:13:12.721 --> 01:13:14.189
THINK IF YOU WANT IF THE GOALS

01:13:14.256 --> 01:13:15.124
COMPLETIO.

01:13:15.190 --> 01:13:16.692
I WOULD PUT THE MONEY INTO MORE

01:13:16.759 --> 01:13:18.560
GRANTS FOR MORE STUDENTS AND I

01:13:18.627 --> 01:13:19.428
THINK IF THE GOAL IS REDUCING

01:13:19.495 --> 01:13:20.195
DEBT.

01:13:20.262 --> 01:13:25.467
I WOULD PUT IN TO INCREASE THE

01:13:25.534 --> 01:13:27.870
COVERAGE ACCESS A WORD

01:13:27.936 --> 01:13:28.170
[inaudible]

01:13:28.237 --> 01:13:30.105
ASSEMBLYMEMBER LIVING.

01:13:30.172 --> 01:13:31.006
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU

01:13:31.073 --> 01:13:31.940
TO THE PANELISTS AND THE I

01:13:32.007 --> 01:13:32.841
APOLOGIZE THE NEXT TWO PANELS

01:13:32.908 --> 01:13:33.942
BECAUSE I'M NOT GOING TO BE ABLE --

01:13:34.009 --> 01:13:34.777
TO REMAIN AND MY QUESTIONS ARE

01:13:34.843 --> 01:13:35.878
AS MUCH TO THEM AS THEY ARE TO

01:13:35.944 --> 01:13:38.647
USE TO THIS PANEL --

01:13:38.714 --> 01:13:40.015
WHERE YOU'VE BEEN DESCRIPTIVE

01:13:40.082 --> 01:13:42.284
ABOUT THE ABILITY FOR SEGMENTS

01:13:42.351 --> 01:13:44.553
TO BE CREATIVE OR WHAT WHAT

01:13:44.620 --> 01:13:45.954
BINDS THEM --

01:13:46.021 --> 01:13:47.055
IN THEIR CREATIVITY BUT OF

01:13:47.122 --> 01:13:50.092
COURSE ACCESS TO RESOURCES IS

01:13:50.159 --> 01:13:51.994
ONE OF THEM --

01:13:52.060 --> 01:13:56.165
BUT ALSO WHERE WE EMPHASIZE --

01:13:56.231 --> 01:13:58.000
THE THE IMPORTANCE OF WHERE

01:13:58.066 --> 01:13:59.401
PEOPLE GET GET AN EDUCATION AND

01:13:59.468 --> 01:14:00.836
SO -- AS

01:14:00.903 --> 01:14:02.037
MUCH FOR YOU IS AS THOSE WHO ARE

01:14:02.104 --> 01:14:03.639
PAYING ATTENTION I STUDIED AT

01:14:03.705 --> 01:14:04.306
CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE BUT I WOULD

01:14:04.373 --> 01:14:05.941
NEVER HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GRADUATE

01:14:06.008 --> 01:14:07.242
IN A TIMELY MANNER WITHOUT.

01:14:07.309 --> 01:14:08.744
GOING TO TWO DIFFERENT COMMUNITY

01:14:08.811 --> 01:14:10.946
COLLEGES OR A PROFESSOR WHO LET

01:14:11.013 --> 01:14:12.514
ME TAKE A COURSE DURING THE

01:14:12.581 --> 01:14:14.249
SUMMER BUT REGISTER FOR IT IN

01:14:14.316 --> 01:14:14.950
THE FALL.

01:14:15.017 --> 01:14:16.285
SO WOULD HAVE TO PAY EXORBITANT

01:14:16.351 --> 01:14:18.120
SUMMER FEES AND DROP IT INTO MY

01:14:18.187 --> 01:14:20.455
FULL TIME COURSE LOAD IN IN THE

01:14:20.522 --> 01:14:21.523
FALL AND SHE DIDN'T BAT AN

01:14:21.590 --> 01:14:23.525
EYELASH WHEN SHE SAID ABSOLUTELY

01:14:23.592 --> 01:14:25.027
NOT A PROBLEM.

01:14:25.093 --> 01:14:26.762
AND SO THERE'S THERE'S A LOT OF

01:14:26.829 --> 01:14:30.299
CREATIVITY AT EACH AND TO BE

01:14:30.365 --> 01:14:32.334
ABLE TO GRADUATE IN --

01:14:32.401 --> 01:14:32.801
IN A WAY THAT SIDE.

01:14:32.868 --> 01:14:34.970
MINDFUL OF THE RESOURCE THAT WE

01:14:35.037 --> 01:14:36.905
ALL HAVE TO PUT TO IT.

01:14:36.972 --> 01:14:39.141
SO WHAT WHAT'S THAT LOS LEFT TO

01:14:39.208 --> 01:14:41.210
ME WHEN I REVIEW ALL OF THE

01:14:41.276 --> 01:14:44.079
FUNDS AND AND YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT

01:14:44.146 --> 01:14:46.014
WE'RE WE'RE PUTTING TOWARDS

01:14:46.081 --> 01:14:47.282
DIFFERENT SEGMENTS IS THAT.

01:14:47.349 --> 01:14:49.384
AT AND INVESTED IN COMMUNITY

01:14:49.451 --> 01:14:50.385
COLLEGE IS EXTRAORDINARILY

01:14:50.452 --> 01:14:51.353
IMPORTANT AND IT'S A HUGE

01:14:51.420 --> 01:14:52.921
LIMITATION ON PEOPLE AND I THINK

01:14:52.988 --> 01:14:54.990
THAT NOT ONLY DO WE MISS OUT ON

01:14:55.057 --> 01:14:56.291
THAT BECAUSE OF THE AID THAT WE

01:14:56.358 --> 01:14:57.593
APPLY TO IT.

01:14:57.659 --> 01:14:59.828
BUT ALSO BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF

01:14:59.895 --> 01:15:01.396
EMPHASIS THAT THIS IS GOING TO

01:15:01.463 --> 01:15:02.097
BE A PLACE WHERE YOU CAN BE

01:15:02.164 --> 01:15:04.433
SUCCESSFUL AND EIGHT IS A IS A

01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:06.435
CONDUIT TO THAT SUCCESS FOR SO

01:15:06.501 --> 01:15:07.936
MANY STUDENTS.

01:15:08.003 --> 01:15:09.404
TO HAVE SO MANY DIFFERENT

01:15:09.471 --> 01:15:12.574
RESPONSIBILITIES --

01:15:12.641 --> 01:15:14.776
D. V..

01:15:14.843 --> 01:15:16.144
WE WE GOT HURT A LITTLE BIT

01:15:16.211 --> 01:15:17.546
ABOUT SOME OF WHAT YOU SEE IS

01:15:17.613 --> 01:15:19.648
DOING AND CAPPING HOW MUCH IS

01:15:19.715 --> 01:15:20.515
STUDENTS CONTRIBUTION SUPPOSED

01:15:20.582 --> 01:15:21.683
TO BE.

01:15:21.750 --> 01:15:25.120
AND SO THE QUESTION WITH ALL OF

01:15:25.187 --> 01:15:27.389
THAT LEADING UP TO IT IS WHETHER

01:15:27.456 --> 01:15:29.892
OR NOT THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF

01:15:29.958 --> 01:15:31.260
SEGMENTS IN OTHER SCHOOLS

01:15:31.326 --> 01:15:32.594
WHETHER IT'S THE THREE SECONDS

01:15:32.661 --> 01:15:33.629
OF PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION

01:15:33.695 --> 01:15:34.963
CALIFORNIA OR THE PRIVATE

01:15:35.030 --> 01:15:36.064
SCHOOLS.

01:15:36.131 --> 01:15:38.600
WHO ARE ABLE TO BE MORE CREATIVE?

01:15:38.667 --> 01:15:40.535
IN THEIR APPROACH SOME OF IT

01:15:40.602 --> 01:15:42.104
MIGHT BE ACCESS TO MONEY TO

01:15:42.170 --> 01:15:43.405
APPLY TO IT.

01:15:43.472 --> 01:15:44.840
BUT ALSO --

01:15:44.907 --> 01:15:46.942
IN IN YOU KNOW THE CONCEPT OF

01:15:47.009 --> 01:15:49.011
THE CAL GRANT PLUS --

01:15:49.077 --> 01:15:49.611
BEING CREATIVE IN THE WAY THAT

01:15:49.678 --> 01:15:52.281
WORKS TO WHERE THE STUDENTS HAVE

01:15:52.347 --> 01:15:54.283
THOSE NEEDS.

01:15:54.349 --> 01:15:56.285
DO THE PRIVATE SCHOOLS HAVE A

01:15:56.351 --> 01:15:57.219
LEG UP -- A

01:15:57.286 --> 01:15:58.854
BANDAGE ON THAT TYPE OF

01:15:58.921 --> 01:16:00.088
CREATIVITY IS IT.

01:16:00.155 --> 01:16:01.823
YOU SEE WITH ACCESS TO MORE

01:16:01.890 --> 01:16:03.358
FUNDRAISING AMONG THE PUBLIC

01:16:03.425 --> 01:16:05.127
SEGMENTS HOW WOULD YOU FIGURE

01:16:05.193 --> 01:16:07.029
THAT OUT AND THEN WHAT CAN WE DO

01:16:07.095 --> 01:16:09.031
AS LAWMAKERS.

01:16:09.097 --> 01:16:11.500
TO REDUCE THE THE FETTERS THAT

01:16:11.566 --> 01:16:12.834
THAT BIND THEM TO WHAT THEIR

01:16:12.901 --> 01:16:17.773
LIMITATIONS ARE.

01:16:17.839 --> 01:16:19.308
WELL THAT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION --

01:16:19.374 --> 01:16:21.677
IN TERMS OF THE PRIVATE

01:16:21.743 --> 01:16:23.011
INSTITUTIONS --

01:16:23.078 --> 01:16:24.379
I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK FOR THE A

01:16:24.446 --> 01:16:27.182
CC YOU WHO I KNOW IS HERE TODAY.

01:16:27.249 --> 01:16:29.785
BUT I WOULD JUST.

01:16:29.851 --> 01:16:31.787
GUESS THAT IT WITH THERE'D AB

01:16:31.853 --> 01:16:33.088
PLUS SCHOOLS YOU MIGHT SEE

01:16:33.155 --> 01:16:34.222
EIGHTY PLUS DIFFERENT APPROACHES

01:16:34.289 --> 01:16:34.756
JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE VERY

01:16:34.823 --> 01:16:35.757
DIFFERENT.

01:16:35.824 --> 01:16:37.025
SCHOOLS IN TERMS OF THE FUNDS

01:16:37.092 --> 01:16:38.160
THEY HAVE AVAILABLE THE STUDENT

01:16:38.226 --> 01:16:39.962
POPULATION THEY SERVE --

01:16:40.028 --> 01:16:41.697
AND SO FORTH CERTAINLY MANY OF

01:16:41.763 --> 01:16:43.198
THEM ARE ABLE TO GET CREATIVE I

01:16:43.265 --> 01:16:44.433
THINK THE QUESTION THAT YOU

01:16:44.499 --> 01:16:46.101
ASKED ABOUT THE CREATIVITY AT

01:16:46.168 --> 01:16:47.736
THE INSTITUTIONAL LEVEL GOES A

01:16:47.803 --> 01:16:49.171
LITTLE BIT TO WHAT MR CHARMIN

01:16:49.237 --> 01:16:52.007
WAS REFERENCING AND WHAT --

01:16:52.074 --> 01:16:53.342
PRESENT UPON TANA CHANCELLOR

01:16:53.408 --> 01:16:55.444
WHITE MENTION IN THEIR SET OF

01:16:55.510 --> 01:16:55.978
PRINCIPLES FOR FINANCIALLY

01:16:56.044 --> 01:16:58.213
REFORM WHICH IS THAT THE IDEA

01:16:58.280 --> 01:16:59.748
THAT THE STUDENT IS.

01:16:59.815 --> 01:17:01.917
QUOTE UNQUOTE PACKAGE TO BEING

01:17:01.984 --> 01:17:06.154
THERE A AT THE CAMPUS LEVEL.

01:17:06.221 --> 01:17:07.222
AND CERTAINLY THE STUDENT A

01:17:07.289 --> 01:17:08.523
COMMISSION IS NOT PROPOSING THAT

01:17:08.590 --> 01:17:10.726
THE STATE TAKEOVER THAT PROCESS

01:17:10.792 --> 01:17:12.060
I THINK --

01:17:12.127 --> 01:17:13.862
THAT IS WHERE YOU SEE INDIVIDUAL

01:17:13.929 --> 01:17:16.431
SITUATIONS THAT THERE'S A VERY

01:17:16.498 --> 01:17:18.233
UNIQUE I MEAN FOUR THOUSAND

01:17:18.300 --> 01:17:19.701
STUDENTS SIR BY CAL GRANT FOR

01:17:19.768 --> 01:17:21.703
THE THOUSAND STORIES AMONG THE

01:17:21.770 --> 01:17:22.804
STUDENTS YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN

01:17:22.871 --> 01:17:24.806
APPROACHED BY STUDENTS WHO JUST

01:17:24.873 --> 01:17:26.708
TO GIVE ONE EXAMPLE --

01:17:26.775 --> 01:17:27.642
TELL ME THAT --

01:17:27.709 --> 01:17:30.712
THAT THEIR THEIR LGBT Q. AND

01:17:30.779 --> 01:17:32.748
THEIR PARENTS --

01:17:32.814 --> 01:17:33.715
DON'T WANT TO SUPPORT THEM IN

01:17:33.782 --> 01:17:35.117
COLLEGE BUT OF COURSE FASTER

01:17:35.183 --> 01:17:36.952
REQUIRES A CALCULATION BASED ON

01:17:37.019 --> 01:17:38.553
PARENTAL INCOME AND IN THOSE

01:17:38.620 --> 01:17:39.988
CASES I KNOW THEY CAN GO TO

01:17:40.055 --> 01:17:40.522
THEIR CAMPUS FINANCIAL AID

01:17:40.589 --> 01:17:42.090
OFFICE AND GET WHAT'S CALLED A

01:17:42.157 --> 01:17:43.258
PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT.

01:17:43.325 --> 01:17:44.559
OVERRIDE THAT SOMETHING THAT IS

01:17:44.626 --> 01:17:46.028
CLEARLY MORE APPROPRIATELY

01:17:46.094 --> 01:17:47.462
HANDLED AT THE CAMPUS LEVEL THAN.

01:17:47.529 --> 01:17:49.564
AT THE STATE LEVEL FROM A

01:17:49.631 --> 01:17:51.633
SACRAMENTO BASED BUREAUCRACY --

01:17:51.700 --> 01:17:55.504
BUT I THINK THAT --

01:17:55.570 --> 01:17:56.605
I THINK THAT IT JUST TOOK SERVE

01:17:56.671 --> 01:17:57.105
BECAUSE THE QUESTION OF

01:17:57.172 --> 01:17:58.173
INSTITUTIONAL LATER HOW RATHER

01:17:58.240 --> 01:17:59.541
THAN THE STATE'S SWEEPING IT

01:17:59.608 --> 01:18:01.076
WOULD BE MORE OF A PARTNERSHIP

01:18:01.143 --> 01:18:02.077
BETWEEN THE STATE AND THE

01:18:02.144 --> 01:18:03.545
INSTITUTIONS I THINK --

01:18:03.612 --> 01:18:05.547
A COLLABORATIVE PROCESS IS

01:18:05.614 --> 01:18:08.450
WHAT'S CALLED FOR HERE AT THAT

01:18:08.517 --> 01:18:09.051
SORT OF ADDRESSES WHAT YOU'RE

01:18:09.117 --> 01:18:10.452
ASKING.

01:18:10.519 --> 01:18:11.620
IF IF I MAY I EIGHT YOU KNOW I

01:18:11.686 --> 01:18:12.487
TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT A

01:18:12.554 --> 01:18:13.588
CONSENSUS APPROACH AND HOW

01:18:13.655 --> 01:18:14.923
THERE'S THIS FAIRLY SIMILAR

01:18:14.990 --> 01:18:16.224
MODEL THAT'S NOW BEEN PROPOSED

01:18:16.291 --> 01:18:17.959
BY SEVERAL OTHER ENTITIES AND I

01:18:18.026 --> 01:18:18.693
WOULD BE REMISS IF I DID NOT

01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:19.628
MENTION.

01:18:19.694 --> 01:18:21.363
THAT THAT IS ACTUALLY A CAN TO

01:18:21.430 --> 01:18:22.130
WHAT THE UNIVERSITY OF

01:18:22.197 --> 01:18:23.899
CALIFORNIA DOES CURRENTLY THEY

01:18:23.965 --> 01:18:25.267
HAVE WHAT THEY CALL AN EDUCATION

01:18:25.333 --> 01:18:26.435
FINANCE MODEL THEY CALL THEIR

01:18:26.501 --> 01:18:27.302
EFM.

01:18:27.369 --> 01:18:29.004
AND IT DOES EXACTLY WHAT I'VE

01:18:29.071 --> 01:18:30.138
MENTIONED IT LOOKS AT THE TOTAL

01:18:30.205 --> 01:18:31.239
COST OF ATTENDANCE WHAT'S

01:18:31.306 --> 01:18:32.307
REASONABLE FOR STUDENTS AND

01:18:32.374 --> 01:18:33.975
FAMILIES AND THEN IT COVERS THE

01:18:34.042 --> 01:18:35.077
REST THROUGH FINANCIALLY THAT

01:18:35.143 --> 01:18:36.945
COMMUNICATES AT TO STUDENTS AND

01:18:37.012 --> 01:18:38.313
FAMILIES CLEARLY --

01:18:38.380 --> 01:18:39.614
NO IT'S NOT PERFECT IT WAS

01:18:39.681 --> 01:18:40.582
PERFECT WE WOULDN'T SEE THE

01:18:40.649 --> 01:18:42.017
DISPROPORTIONATE DEBT THAT I

01:18:42.084 --> 01:18:42.918
THAT I JUST MENTIONED A MINUTE

01:18:42.984 --> 01:18:44.953
AGO BUT I THINK IT DOES SPEAK TO

01:18:45.020 --> 01:18:46.288
CREATIVITY.

01:18:46.354 --> 01:18:47.923
AND THE CREATIVITY THAT COLLEGES

01:18:47.989 --> 01:18:50.826
CAN ENGAGE THE MESSAGING IN

01:18:50.892 --> 01:18:52.094
TERMS OF PACKAGING WHEN THEY

01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:53.061
HAVE THE RESOURCES THE

01:18:53.128 --> 01:18:55.030
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA'S

01:18:55.097 --> 01:18:56.031
FORTUNATE TO HAVE AN ENROLLMENT

01:18:56.098 --> 01:18:57.265
OF BY STUDENT BODY THAT'S VERY

01:18:57.332 --> 01:18:59.101
ALIGNED WITH THAT CAL GRANT

01:18:59.167 --> 01:19:00.735
ENTITLEMENT POPULATION --

01:19:00.802 --> 01:19:01.870
AND THEN THEY ALSO HAVE QUITE A

01:19:01.937 --> 01:19:03.205
BIT OF INSTITUTIONAL EIGHT OF

01:19:03.271 --> 01:19:04.806
THEIR OWN TO DOLE OUT SO --

01:19:04.873 --> 01:19:06.808
CREATIVITY IS GREAT AND WE WANT

01:19:06.875 --> 01:19:08.577
TO ENCOURAGE AT AND RESOURCES

01:19:08.643 --> 01:19:11.480
SURELY HELP THAT.

01:19:11.546 --> 01:19:13.682
OKAY THANK YOU SOMEONE EVER

01:19:13.748 --> 01:19:16.218

TIME SITTING ON THIS COMMITTEE

01:19:21.356 --> 01:19:22.791
AND I APOLOGIZE.

01:19:22.858 --> 01:19:24.659
FOR BEING LATE WAS TESTIFYING ON

01:19:24.726 --> 01:19:25.260
ANOTHER WHAT BILL IN ANOTHER

01:19:25.327 --> 01:19:26.461
COMMITTEE SO I DIDN'T HEAR THE

01:19:26.528 --> 01:19:28.230
BEGINNING OF OF OF YOUR

01:19:28.296 --> 01:19:30.198
PRESENTATION BUT I'VE INTRODUCED

01:19:30.265 --> 01:19:31.466
LEGISLATION TO EXPAND THE NUMBER

01:19:31.533 --> 01:19:32.901
OF COMPETITIVE CAL GRANTS AND

01:19:32.968 --> 01:19:34.302
I'M JUST CURIOUS.

01:19:34.369 --> 01:19:35.971
YOUR ASSESSMENT OF THAT --

01:19:36.037 --> 01:19:37.672
AND ALSO AS WE THINK ABOUT --

01:19:37.739 --> 01:19:39.107
LONGER TERM MORE STRUCTURAL

01:19:39.174 --> 01:19:40.542
REFORMS DOES IT MAKE SENSE BUT

01:19:40.609 --> 01:19:41.710
POTENTIALLY TO INCREASE OF

01:19:41.776 --> 01:19:42.477
EXPANDING THE NUMBER OF CAL

01:19:42.544 --> 01:19:44.246
GRANTS NOW TO HELP STUDENTS THAT

01:19:44.312 --> 01:19:44.713
ARE.

01:19:44.779 --> 01:19:45.747
IN IN --

01:19:45.814 --> 01:19:46.381
INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER LEARNING

01:19:46.448 --> 01:19:49.017
NOW -- IN

01:19:49.084 --> 01:19:50.252
THE NEAR FUTURE AS WERE

01:19:50.318 --> 01:19:51.186
CONSIDERING SOME OF THESE LONGER

01:19:51.253 --> 01:19:55.223
TERM STRUCTURAL CHANGES.

01:19:55.290 --> 01:19:57.492
I'D SAY THAT YES TO BOTH SO

01:19:57.559 --> 01:19:59.161
EXPAND IT MORE COMPETITIVE

01:19:59.227 --> 01:20:00.996
AWARDS IS FILLING REAL NEEDS

01:20:01.062 --> 01:20:02.697
THAT WE'VE ALREADY DETERMINED A

01:20:02.764 --> 01:20:06.201
REAL NEEDS. FOR STUDENTS WHO --

01:20:06.268 --> 01:20:07.636
WHO HAVE EXPENSES THAT THEY

01:20:07.702 --> 01:20:09.671
UNABLE TO COVER --

01:20:09.738 --> 01:20:13.341
AND AND THE MORE THAT WE START

01:20:13.408 --> 01:20:14.743
FILLING THOSE GAPS IN THE WAYS

01:20:14.809 --> 01:20:16.811
THAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING --

01:20:16.878 --> 01:20:18.780
THE CLOSER WILL GET TO BEING

01:20:18.847 --> 01:20:20.715
ABLE TO HAVE SOME MORE EXPANSIVE

01:20:20.782 --> 01:20:23.285
REFORMS WHERE PERHAPS EVEN SOME

01:20:23.351 --> 01:20:24.853
SOME OF THAT ARE NOW COMPETITIVE

01:20:24.920 --> 01:20:25.720
CAL GRANTS.

01:20:25.787 --> 01:20:28.790
BECOME SOMETHING THAT IS --

01:20:28.857 --> 01:20:30.158
AN ENTITLEMENT THAT WE CAN

01:20:30.225 --> 01:20:32.294
COMMUNICATE AND EARLIER WAY WITH

01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:35.063
WITH STUDENTS AND MORE EVEN MORE

01:20:35.130 --> 01:20:37.365
EFFECTIVELY AFFECT THEIR

01:20:37.432 --> 01:20:38.967
LIKELIHOOD OF AND THEN ROLLING

01:20:39.034 --> 01:20:40.202
LIKELIHOOD OF ENROLLING FULL

01:20:40.268 --> 01:20:43.238
TIME -- AND

01:20:43.305 --> 01:20:45.840
THEN COMPLETING.

01:20:45.907 --> 01:20:46.775
I WOULD ECHO THAT AND TO SAY

01:20:46.841 --> 01:20:47.442
THAT -- THE

01:20:47.509 --> 01:20:48.910
LONG TERM FOCUS IS APPRECIATED

01:20:48.977 --> 01:20:49.945
BECAUSE THERE'S A GREAT CHART IN

01:20:50.011 --> 01:20:51.646
THE GENDER THAT THE CALIFORNIA

01:20:51.713 --> 01:20:52.814
BUDGET POLICY CENTER PREPARE THE

01:20:52.881 --> 01:20:54.716
SHOWS THAT THE DEMAND FOR THE

01:20:54.783 --> 01:20:55.317
COMPETITIVE CAL GRANT PROGRAM

01:20:55.383 --> 01:20:56.218
HAS.

01:20:56.284 --> 01:20:57.485
MORE THAN DOUBLED IN THE PAST

01:20:57.552 --> 01:20:58.453
DECADE WHERE THE NUMBER OF

01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:00.388
AWARDS THE STATE HAS INCREASED

01:21:00.455 --> 01:21:01.856
ONLY SLIGHTLY SO --

01:21:01.923 --> 01:21:04.459
ABSOLUTELY APPRECIATE THAT TO

01:21:04.526 --> 01:21:06.595
SOMEONE OR SPECIFICALLY --

01:21:06.661 --> 01:21:08.363
THE THE EQUITY FOR THE DREAMER

01:21:08.430 --> 01:21:09.531
POPULATION I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE

01:21:09.598 --> 01:21:10.999
LEGISLATION TO EXPAND A

01:21:11.066 --> 01:21:12.500
COMPETITIVE CALVET ELIGIBILITY

01:21:12.567 --> 01:21:13.935
TO DREAMERS ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:21:14.002 --> 01:21:16.238
KNOWN AS IS RUNNING LEGISLATION.

01:21:16.304 --> 01:21:17.339
TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL AID TO

01:21:17.405 --> 01:21:18.206
THAT POPULATION BECAUSE A

01:21:18.273 --> 01:21:19.908
CURRENTLY LEFT OUT A FEDERAL

01:21:19.975 --> 01:21:20.842
FINANCIAL AID.

01:21:20.909 --> 01:21:22.644
IS A GOOD LONG TERM FOCUS FOR

01:21:22.711 --> 01:21:24.479
THE STATE I THINK BECAUSE OF

01:21:24.546 --> 01:21:26.448
THAT POPULATION IS ALSO ONLY

01:21:26.514 --> 01:21:28.650
GOING TO GROW.

01:21:28.717 --> 01:21:30.685
THANK YOU AT THAT THAT'S AN

01:21:30.752 --> 01:21:32.420
IMPORTANT ISSUE AND MISTER --

01:21:32.487 --> 01:21:33.288
MEDINA AUTHORED A BILL ON THAT A

01:21:33.355 --> 01:21:35.390
FEW YEARS AGO AND WE DID

01:21:35.457 --> 01:21:36.791
INCREASE THE COMPATIBLE WORDS

01:21:36.858 --> 01:21:38.226
TWO YEARS AGO AND THE GOVERNOR'S

01:21:38.293 --> 01:21:40.428
BUDGET HE HAS A SLIGHT INCREASE.

01:21:40.495 --> 01:21:41.496
ONE ISSUE THAT THAT CAME UP AND

01:21:41.563 --> 01:21:43.965
I'M SURE MR GABRIEL IN THE

01:21:44.032 --> 01:21:45.100
DEBATE WILL TALK ABOUT THIS IS.

01:21:45.166 --> 01:21:46.768
I I I I THINK WE SHOULD DO IT

01:21:46.835 --> 01:21:48.637
INCREASING PET AWARDS BUT THERE

01:21:48.703 --> 01:21:50.505
IS A REPORTFOR YEARS AGO IF MR

01:21:50.572 --> 01:21:51.172
NEED COMMISSION WHEN THEY LOOKED

01:21:51.239 --> 01:21:53.174
AT COMPETITIVE STUDENTS THE

01:21:53.241 --> 01:21:55.277
COMPATIBLE --

01:21:55.343 --> 01:21:56.311
APPLICANTS WHO DID NOT GET THE

01:21:56.378 --> 01:21:57.379
AWARD.

01:21:57.445 --> 01:22:00.015
AND YOU KNOW THAT THAT THAT

01:22:00.081 --> 01:22:01.016
CLASS --

01:22:01.082 --> 01:22:02.384
HAPPY HAPPY EMPTY SAYS THOSE YOU

01:22:02.450 --> 01:22:03.618
KNOW FOLKS ARE GOING TO NOT GO

01:22:03.685 --> 01:22:05.086
TO COLLEGE.

01:22:05.153 --> 01:22:07.255
AND NOT HAVE A GOOD HIGHER

01:22:07.322 --> 01:22:10.292
EDUCATION FULLER APPARENTLY

01:22:10.358 --> 01:22:12.260
FOUND THAT THE STUDENTS DID GO

01:22:12.327 --> 01:22:13.561
TO COLLEGE AND WERE SUCCESSFUL

01:22:13.628 --> 01:22:15.030
IN SOME SOME WAY SO IT IS THERE

01:22:15.096 --> 01:22:17.232
ANY -- DATA

01:22:17.299 --> 01:22:18.800
THAT SHOWS THAT IT'S THAT SMART

01:22:18.867 --> 01:22:22.103
INVESTMENT OR MORE NOT SO.

01:22:22.170 --> 01:22:23.305
I BELIEVE YOU'RE REFERRING TO A

01:22:23.371 --> 01:22:24.639

01:22:24.706 --> 01:22:26.007
WAS PREPARED ON OUR BEHALF

01:22:26.074 --> 01:22:28.343
THROUGH US STANFORD RESEARCHER

01:22:28.410 --> 01:22:30.245
WE WORK WITH NAMED A DEAD GRANTS --

01:22:30.312 --> 01:22:33.181

METHOD WHICH I HAVE TO ASK FOR A

01:22:41.856 --> 01:22:43.258
LOT FROM.

01:22:43.325 --> 01:22:44.492
MY RESEARCHER COLLEAGUES --

01:22:44.559 --> 01:22:46.528
ESSENTIALLY THE REPORT LOOKED AT

01:22:46.594 --> 01:22:48.129
MANY YEARS OF THE COMPETITIVE

STATE COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND DID

01:22:51.266 --> 01:22:52.867
CONCLUDE THE FOR THAT POPULATION.

01:22:52.934 --> 01:22:54.502
THERE APPEARED TO BE A

01:22:54.569 --> 01:22:57.439
NEGLIGIBLE IMPACT ON THEIR

01:22:57.505 --> 01:22:59.774
GRADUATION OR THEIR COME

01:22:59.841 --> 01:23:00.675
ATTAINMENT --

01:23:00.742 --> 01:23:02.077
WHETHER THEY RECEIVE THE

01:23:02.143 --> 01:23:02.711
COMPETITIVE VERSUS STUDENTS WHO

01:23:02.777 --> 01:23:05.246
WERE ELIGIBLE AND DIDN'T QUITE

01:23:05.313 --> 01:23:06.514
MAKE INTO THAT POOL.

01:23:06.581 --> 01:23:07.882
BUT A COUPLE OF THINGS TO NOTE

01:23:07.949 --> 01:23:10.218
THE REPORT DID SAY THAT --

01:23:10.285 --> 01:23:10.852
IT WASN'T NECESSARILY THE RESULT

01:23:10.919 --> 01:23:13.788
OF THE THE STUDENTS MAY BE

01:23:13.855 --> 01:23:15.056
NEEDING SOME ADDITIONAL SUPPORT

01:23:15.123 --> 01:23:17.192
SERVICES ON CAMPUS BECAUSE

01:23:17.258 --> 01:23:18.059
THEY'RE FROM.

01:23:18.126 --> 01:23:19.194
WHAT WE USED TO CALL

01:23:19.260 --> 01:23:21.162
NONTRADITIONAL POPULATION MAYBE

01:23:21.229 --> 01:23:22.430
FIRST GENERATION AND THERE MAY

01:23:22.497 --> 01:23:23.898
BE FOR SOME OF THEM LANGUAGE

01:23:23.965 --> 01:23:25.367
BARRIERS SO THE REPORT --

01:23:25.433 --> 01:23:27.035
DIDN'T NECESSARILY CONCLUDE THAT

01:23:27.102 --> 01:23:29.204
IT WAS BECAUSE OF THE GRANT THAT

01:23:29.270 --> 01:23:31.239
THERE WAS A MINIMAL.

01:23:31.306 --> 01:23:32.040
DIFFERENCE THERE MAY BE OTHER

01:23:32.107 --> 01:23:34.676
FACTORS AND ALSO SINCE THEN.

01:23:34.743 --> 01:23:36.177
THE STATE OF THE LEGISLATURE THE

01:23:36.244 --> 01:23:37.979
MINISTRATION HAVE FUNDED --

01:23:38.046 --> 01:23:39.347

PROVIDE THAT A CAL GRANT BE

01:23:45.453 --> 01:23:46.621
STUDENT AT COMMUNITY COLLEGE

01:23:46.688 --> 01:23:48.156

GET UP TO FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS

01:23:49.824 --> 01:23:51.926

01:23:51.993 --> 01:23:53.661
I THINK BAR AND WE WOULD SAY

THAT -- IT

01:23:54.596 --> 01:23:55.930
BE REALLY GOOD TO SEE WHETHER

01:23:55.997 --> 01:23:57.332
THOSE GRANTS AND SOME OF THE

01:23:57.399 --> 01:23:58.533
ADDITIONAL SUPPORT SERVICES THE

01:23:58.600 --> 01:24:00.135

01:24:11.346 --> 01:24:15.250
THEY CAN START SEARCHING.

01:24:35.136 --> 01:24:35.470
SOMETHING THAT --

01:24:35.537 --> 01:24:36.504

THAT THEY LEAVE WITH --

01:25:39.601 --> 01:25:40.835
UNFORTUNATELY WE AREN'T ABLE TO

DISPROPORTION AUDI OF THAT DEBT

01:25:47.509 --> 01:25:48.910
AND THAT'S ONE OF OUR REGULAR

01:25:48.977 --> 01:25:50.478
RECOMMENDATIONS TO OTHER STATES

01:25:50.545 --> 01:25:52.614
TED TED RARELY ASK YOUR COLLEGES.

01:25:52.680 --> 01:25:54.048
NOT JUST HOW MANY ARE GRADUATING

01:25:54.115 --> 01:25:55.750
WITH DEBT BUT WHICH STUDENTS ARE

01:25:55.817 --> 01:25:56.985
GRADUATING WITH THAT.

01:25:57.051 --> 01:25:58.486

DEBT IS CONCENTRATED THE MOST.

01:26:14.936 --> 01:26:16.804
IT IS IN A LOT FOR EXAMPLE LIKE --

01:26:16.871 --> 01:26:17.772

THAT OVER HALF OF OF OF ALL --

01:26:27.048 --> 01:26:28.216
AT LEAST BERKELEY AND UCLA

01:26:28.283 --> 01:26:29.751
UNDERGRADUATES HAVE THEIR ENTIRE

01:26:29.817 --> 01:26:31.386
TUITION --

01:26:31.452 --> 01:26:35.557
COVERED BY THE STATE --

01:26:35.623 --> 01:26:37.258
A LOT OF MY CONSTITUENTS OR OR

01:26:37.325 --> 01:26:39.561
OR OR SURPRISING EVEN --

01:26:39.627 --> 01:26:41.963
YOU KNOW A QUESTION THE THAT.

01:26:42.030 --> 01:26:44.966
THE THE THE TRUTH OF THAT --

01:26:45.033 --> 01:26:48.870
BUT I MEAN GIVEN THE PROGRESSIVE

01:26:48.937 --> 01:26:50.438
NATURE OF CALIFORNIA'S.

01:26:50.505 --> 01:26:53.274
A FINANCIAL AID PROGRAM OVERALL

01:26:53.341 --> 01:26:54.342
MAIN.

01:26:54.409 --> 01:26:55.810
HOW WAS THAT THE AVERAGE DE

01:26:55.877 --> 01:26:57.011
DISTRIBUTED?

01:26:57.078 --> 01:26:57.845
TO YOU KNOW --

01:26:57.912 --> 01:26:59.280
AMONG DIFFERENT --

01:26:59.347 --> 01:27:01.983
INCOME LEVELS AND AMONG THE THE

01:27:02.050 --> 01:27:03.751
DIFFERENT.

01:27:03.818 --> 01:27:05.920
HIGHER EDUCATION SEGMENTS --

01:27:05.987 --> 01:27:08.022
SO WE HAVE DONE AN ANALYSIS WITH

01:27:08.089 --> 01:27:08.890
THE COUNTY STUDENT ASSOCIATION

01:27:08.957 --> 01:27:10.458

GRADUATE SECOND SPEAK MOST

01:27:12.594 --> 01:27:15.396
CLEARLY TO THE CSU SITUATION --

01:27:15.463 --> 01:27:17.298
AND THERE'S NO SYSTEM IDEA --

01:27:17.365 --> 01:27:18.466
FOR FOR PRIVATE COLLEGES IN

01:27:18.533 --> 01:27:20.201
TERMS OF WHICH STUDENTS HAVE --

01:27:20.268 --> 01:27:24.205
DEBT AT CSU IT'S AS I MENTIONED

01:27:24.272 --> 01:27:26.341
EARLIER IT'S ABOUT AN EIGHT AND

01:27:26.407 --> 01:27:27.375
TEN THE LOAN THAT HAVE FAMILY

01:27:27.442 --> 01:27:29.911
INCOMES UNDER ABOUT FIFTY FOUR

01:27:29.978 --> 01:27:30.545
THOUSAND IN FACT IT'S ABOUT TWO

01:27:30.612 --> 01:27:32.280
THIRDS OF CSU GRADUATES WITH

01:27:32.347 --> 01:27:33.581
WITH STUDENT LOAN THAT.

01:27:33.648 --> 01:27:36.217
HAVE FAMILY INCOMES UNDER.

01:27:36.284 --> 01:27:36.784
TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND IS OUR

01:27:36.851 --> 01:27:37.719
STUDENTS WHO HAVE THEIR TUITION

01:27:37.785 --> 01:27:39.087
COVERED THESE ARE STUDENTS WHO

01:27:39.153 --> 01:27:40.388
ARE STRUGGLING TO PAY FOR THOSE

01:27:40.455 --> 01:27:42.290
NON TUITION COSTS OF COLLEGE --

01:27:42.357 --> 01:27:44.359
WE ALSO IN OUR REPORT LOOKED AT

01:27:44.425 --> 01:27:46.027
BREAKDOWNS BY RACE AND ETHNICITY

01:27:46.094 --> 01:27:47.729
AND IT WAS EIGHT IN TEN BLACK

01:27:47.795 --> 01:27:49.597
STUDENTS THAT WERE GRADUATING

01:27:49.664 --> 01:27:50.765
FROM CSU WHO WERE LIVING WITH

01:27:50.832 --> 01:27:51.599
STUDENT LOAN DEBT SO HIGHLY

01:27:51.666 --> 01:27:53.134
CONCENTRATED AMONGST LOW INCOME

01:27:53.201 --> 01:27:54.902
STUDENTS AND STUDENTS OF COLOR.

01:27:54.969 --> 01:27:58.840
AND AND AND SO I I DID SEE THAT --

01:27:58.906 --> 01:28:00.308
TO THAT INFORMATION BUT IN TERMS

01:28:00.375 --> 01:28:02.343
OF THE AMOUNT OF DEBT --

01:28:02.410 --> 01:28:04.545
IN NOT NOT JUST THE THE NUMBERS

01:28:04.612 --> 01:28:06.247
OF STUDENTS GRADUATE WITH THAT

01:28:06.314 --> 01:28:08.983
BUT THE THE WHO HAS THE HIGHEST

01:28:09.050 --> 01:28:10.051
LEVELS OF DEBT.

01:28:10.118 --> 01:28:11.653
I'M INTERESTINGLY OF OF OF THE

01:28:11.719 --> 01:28:12.887
DATA THAT WE'VE SEEN FOR

01:28:12.954 --> 01:28:16.324
UNDERGRADUATE WE'RE LOOKING A

01:28:16.391 --> 01:28:18.393
OF THE DEBT AMOUNTS --

01:28:18.459 --> 01:28:20.228
FOR INDEBTED GRADUATE SEEMS TO

01:28:20.294 --> 01:28:20.895
BE ABOUT THE SAME ACROSS INCOME

01:28:20.962 --> 01:28:22.497
LEVELS SO THAT DOESN'T VERY

01:28:22.563 --> 01:28:24.432
NEARLY AS MUCH AS STUDENTS

01:28:24.499 --> 01:28:26.200
LIKELY HAD OF LEAVING SCHOOL

01:28:26.267 --> 01:28:27.201
WITH THAT TRIP PACKED.

01:28:27.268 --> 01:28:28.803
SO SO LOW INCOME STUDENTS WHO

01:28:28.870 --> 01:28:29.437
WOULD HAVE.

01:28:29.504 --> 01:28:31.673
ON AVERAGE WOULD BE --

01:28:31.739 --> 01:28:34.008
GRADUALLY WITH ABOUT

01:28:34.075 --> 01:28:35.176
CONSTITUENTS OR OF OUR MIDDLE

01:28:35.243 --> 01:28:38.212
CLASS STUDENTS. FOR THOSE THOSE

OKAY THANK YOU THE CLIP.

01:28:42.316 --> 01:28:44.952

TWENTY FIVE GRAND FOR UC AND CSU.

01:28:46.654 --> 01:28:48.389
I'M THAT THAT NUMBER I BELIEVE

01:28:48.456 --> 01:28:50.258
IS FOR ARMS GRADUATES FROM ALL

01:28:50.324 --> 01:28:51.159
TYPES OF COLLEGES ACROSS THE

01:28:51.225 --> 01:28:52.093
STATE OR AT LEAST PUBLIC AND

01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:53.461
NONPROFIT COLLEGES --

01:28:53.528 --> 01:28:55.897
AMONGST THE UC AND CSU SYSTEM

01:28:55.963 --> 01:28:57.098
THE DEBT LOADS ARE A LITTLE BIT

01:28:57.165 --> 01:29:00.301
LOWER OKAY THANK YOU DOCTOR CHOI.

ATTEND THE COLLEGE --

01:29:07.008 --> 01:29:08.910
BUT THIS TIME WHEN --

01:29:08.976 --> 01:29:11.312
SO MUCH MONEY SEEMS TO BE

01:29:11.379 --> 01:29:14.816
AVAILABLE --

01:29:14.882 --> 01:29:16.317
BECAUSE THE FIRST GENERATION

01:29:16.384 --> 01:29:16.617

STUDENT AT THAT TIME --

01:29:32.133 --> 01:29:34.335
I I I DIDN'T EXPECT THAT THE

01:29:34.402 --> 01:29:36.170
GOVERNMENT WOULD COVER MY TO

01:29:36.237 --> 01:29:43.678
SHOWN WHY ANY ROOM ROOM BOULDER --

01:29:43.745 --> 01:29:45.313
A FINAL [inaudible]

01:29:45.379 --> 01:29:47.515
UP [inaudible]

01:29:47.582 --> 01:29:49.283

BEFORE THE ANSWER EYES WHEN A

01:36:15.002 --> 01:36:16.070
MAYBE SET THE STAGE A LITTLE BIT

01:36:16.137 --> 01:36:17.838
SO -- WE WE

01:36:17.905 --> 01:36:20.007
AGREE 1100% AND WITH THIS IS

01:36:20.074 --> 01:36:21.108
THAT THIS TODAY'S HEARING IS A

01:36:21.175 --> 01:36:22.009
CULMINATION OF THE LAST TWO

01:36:22.076 --> 01:36:22.810
YEARS ON THIS ISSUE.

01:36:22.877 --> 01:36:25.412
AND WE KNOW WE CAN'T AFFORD FREE

01:36:25.479 --> 01:36:27.114
COLLEGE IN CALIFORNIA FOR

01:36:27.181 --> 01:36:28.048
EVERYBODY.

01:36:28.115 --> 01:36:29.450
I DON'T THINK YOU KNOW SHOULD BE

01:36:29.517 --> 01:36:30.951
BE SUBSIDIZING --

01:36:31.018 --> 01:36:32.753
MY KIDS TO GO TO YOU SEE ONE DAY

01:36:32.820 --> 01:36:34.822
THAT BE NICE BUT I'M NOT SURE WE

01:36:34.889 --> 01:36:36.390
CAN AFFORD IT.

01:36:36.457 --> 01:36:36.957
I KNOW --

01:36:37.024 --> 01:36:39.126
MISTER MARTUCCI AND ARKANSAS

01:36:39.193 --> 01:36:40.661
HERE WOULD LIKE THAT TO WITH

01:36:40.728 --> 01:36:41.795
THEIR LITTLE KIDS IN AND MR

01:36:41.862 --> 01:36:42.796
GABRIEL APPEAR BUT I'M NOT SURE

01:36:42.863 --> 01:36:46.133
IF IT MAKES THE MOST SENSE --

01:36:46.200 --> 01:36:46.767
BECAUSE WE HAVE OTHER NEEDS BUT

01:36:46.834 --> 01:36:49.803
I THINK HERE IS DOING WHAT

01:36:49.870 --> 01:36:52.106
YOU'RE JUST SAYING SO PARENTS

01:36:52.173 --> 01:36:53.507
STUDENTS HAVE SKIN IN THE GAME --

01:36:53.574 --> 01:36:55.442
FAMILY SAVE IN THE FIVE TWENTY

01:36:55.509 --> 01:36:56.844
NINE ACCOUNTS WE'RE JUST LOOKING

01:36:56.911 --> 01:36:59.246
AT THAT THE GAP IN THAT THE THE

01:36:59.313 --> 01:37:00.848
COST OF COLLEGE IS DIFFERENT

01:37:00.915 --> 01:37:02.016
THAN IT WAS WHEN YOU WENT TO

01:37:02.082 --> 01:37:03.384
COLLEGE OR TWENTY YEARS AGO.

01:37:03.450 --> 01:37:04.885
THE MINIMUM WAGE DOESN'T GO AS

01:37:04.952 --> 01:37:07.254
FAR TO TO FOR STUDENTS TAKE

01:37:07.321 --> 01:37:08.689
EARNERS EXTRA BOX TO PAY.

01:37:08.756 --> 01:37:10.491
FOR THE COST OF COLLEGE --

01:37:10.558 --> 01:37:11.825
THE HOUSING COSTS HAVE GONE UP

01:37:11.892 --> 01:37:13.594
TREMENDOUSLY AND SO THOSE TWO

01:37:13.661 --> 01:37:15.396
THINGS RIGHT THERE REALLY CHANGE

01:37:15.462 --> 01:37:16.597
THE WHOLE ECONOMICS OF IT SO

01:37:16.664 --> 01:37:18.399
WHAT SO WHAT WE'RE FOCUSING ON

01:37:18.465 --> 01:37:20.834
IS HOW COULD WE DO EXACTLY WHAT

01:37:20.901 --> 01:37:22.169
YOU'RE SAYING --

01:37:22.236 --> 01:37:24.705
HAVE A A MEANS TESTED SYSTEM

01:37:24.772 --> 01:37:26.173
HAVE PARENTS AND STUDENTS.

01:37:26.240 --> 01:37:28.242
PARTICIPATE --

01:37:28.309 --> 01:37:29.376
AS WELL --

01:37:29.443 --> 01:37:31.745
BUT LOOK AT WHERE THE GAPS ARE

01:37:31.812 --> 01:37:33.380
TO MAKE COLLEGE MORE AFFORDABLE

01:37:33.447 --> 01:37:36.450
FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE KIND OF IN

01:37:36.517 --> 01:37:37.051
THE MIDDLE SO MAYBE YOU COULD

01:37:37.117 --> 01:37:39.019
JUMP IN.

01:37:39.086 --> 01:37:40.087
TRY THAT ON THE TAX CREDIT --

01:37:40.154 --> 01:37:41.589
ISSUE I THINK THERE IS A LOT OF

01:37:41.655 --> 01:37:43.624
POTENTIAL FOR COLLEGE SAVINGS

01:37:43.691 --> 01:37:45.159
ACCOUNTS ESPECIALLY FOR LOW

01:37:45.226 --> 01:37:46.594
INCOME STUDENTS TO SEND A

01:37:46.660 --> 01:37:47.461
MESSAGE ABOUT PLANNINGFOR

01:37:47.528 --> 01:37:48.929
COLLEGE I'VE MONEY IN THE BANK

01:37:48.996 --> 01:37:49.797
THEY KNOW IT.

01:37:49.863 --> 01:37:50.898
AS THEY'RE GROWING UP I THINK

01:37:50.965 --> 01:37:51.765
THERE'S A THERE IS A LOT OF

01:37:51.832 --> 01:37:53.167
POTENTIAL THERE --

01:37:53.234 --> 01:37:54.868
THE BIG QUESTION IS REACH AND

01:37:54.935 --> 01:37:59.740
HOW DO YOU FOR A POPULATION THAT --

01:37:59.807 --> 01:38:02.910
WHO DOES NOT HAVE JUST INCOME

01:38:02.977 --> 01:38:04.178
AND IS --

01:38:04.245 --> 01:38:05.746
PROBABLY --

01:38:05.813 --> 01:38:08.482
AND IT IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY TO BE

01:38:08.549 --> 01:38:11.118
TAKING DEDUCTIONS ON THEIR ON

01:38:11.185 --> 01:38:12.853
THEIR TAXES --

01:38:12.920 --> 01:38:15.222
THAT INCENTIVE IS NOT LIKELY TO

01:38:15.289 --> 01:38:16.924
BE THE ONE THAT ENTERS THEM INTO

01:38:16.991 --> 01:38:17.925
THE SYSTEM --

01:38:17.992 --> 01:38:19.627
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE

01:38:19.693 --> 01:38:20.995
GOVERNOR WHEN HE WAS --

01:38:21.061 --> 01:38:24.098
MAYOR SAN FRANCISCO WAS --

01:38:24.164 --> 01:38:25.566
LAUNCHED A PROGRAM OR EXPANDED A

01:38:25.633 --> 01:38:28.002
PROGRAM THERE THAT PROVIDED --

01:38:28.068 --> 01:38:30.437
A SEAT ABOUT OF OF SAVINGS TO

01:38:30.504 --> 01:38:32.273
EVERY CHILD BORN IN THE CITY I

01:38:32.339 --> 01:38:33.107
THINK THAT'S THE WAY IT WAS

01:38:33.173 --> 01:38:34.842
DESIGNED AND I THINK I HEARD

01:38:34.908 --> 01:38:36.010
THAT THERE'S A PROPOSAL TO

01:38:36.076 --> 01:38:38.545
EXPAND THAT CONCEPT --

01:38:38.612 --> 01:38:42.116
STATE STATEWIDE --

01:38:42.182 --> 01:38:45.386
IF YOU ARE EXTREMELY LOYAL YOU

01:38:45.452 --> 01:38:47.087
GET FREE TUITION IF IF YOU ARE

01:38:47.154 --> 01:38:49.089
EXTREMELY RICH YOU DON'T HAVE TO

01:38:49.156 --> 01:38:51.792
WORRY ABOUT BECAUSE YOU PAY.

01:38:51.859 --> 01:38:54.461
HOW ABOUT IN THEM BORDERLINE?

01:38:54.528 --> 01:38:58.899
I MEAN THEY NEED ASSISTANCE --

01:38:58.966 --> 01:39:00.668
TO SO THAT THAT'S THE SECOND

01:39:00.734 --> 01:39:02.336
TIME I'M A SPEAKING YEAH YEAH

01:39:02.403 --> 01:39:03.604
AND THAT CUT AND THIS THE

01:39:03.671 --> 01:39:05.172
SAVINGS INCENTIVES THAT EXIST

01:39:05.239 --> 01:39:07.074
AND DO TEND --

01:39:07.141 --> 01:39:08.142
TO THE PARTICIPANTS TEND TO BE

01:39:08.208 --> 01:39:11.211
AND UPPER INCOME --

01:39:11.278 --> 01:39:13.514
TERRITORY SO --

01:39:13.580 --> 01:39:16.216
SURE THAT OTHERS SAY AND THAT

01:39:16.283 --> 01:39:17.651
THEY KNOW THEY HAVE SAVINGS NOT

01:39:17.718 --> 01:39:19.320
JUST FOR TUITION BUT FOR THOSE

01:39:19.386 --> 01:39:20.487
OTHER EXPENSES WERE TALKING

01:39:20.554 --> 01:39:22.823
ABOUT BECAUSE GETTING TO TO YOUR

01:39:22.890 --> 01:39:24.325
YOUR EARLIER POINT ABOUT.

01:39:24.391 --> 01:39:25.826
WORKING YOUR WAY THROUGH COLLEGE

01:39:25.893 --> 01:39:27.594
WE HAVE THE STRUCTURE OF A CON A

01:39:27.661 --> 01:39:29.730
MI HAS CHANGED SO MUCH THAT IT

01:39:29.797 --> 01:39:30.798
USED TO BE THAT YOU CAN WORK

01:39:30.864 --> 01:39:32.866
PART TIME AND COVER.

01:39:32.933 --> 01:39:35.369
UP RENT AND FOOD --

01:39:35.436 --> 01:39:38.372
AT SCHOOL BUT WITH WAGES THE WAY

01:39:38.439 --> 01:39:40.274
THEY ARE NOW FOR NON COLLEGE

01:39:40.341 --> 01:39:42.042
GRADUATES IT IS NOT NEARLY

01:39:42.109 --> 01:39:44.044
ENOUGH TO DO THAT WHICH IS WHY

01:39:44.111 --> 01:39:45.079
WE HAVE --

01:39:45.145 --> 01:39:46.480
THAT COST ISSUES THAT WE HAVE

01:39:46.547 --> 01:39:51.552
EVEN WHEN TUITION IS WAIVED.

01:39:51.618 --> 01:39:52.553
AND I JUST WANNA NOTICEABLY

01:39:52.619 --> 01:39:53.220
MEMBER --

01:39:53.287 --> 01:39:54.621
THIS STUDENT AID COMMISSION IS --

01:39:54.688 --> 01:39:56.590
ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN --

01:39:56.657 --> 01:39:58.025
WORKING WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

01:39:58.092 --> 01:39:59.526
TO ENCOURAGE FAMILIES TO SET UP

01:39:59.593 --> 01:40:00.994
THOSE SAVINGS ACCOUNTS WHEN THE

01:40:01.061 --> 01:40:02.796
CHILD IS YOUNG SO --

01:40:02.863 --> 01:40:03.597
LAST YEAR --

01:40:03.664 --> 01:40:05.532
THE THINGS TO LEGISLATION THAT

01:40:05.599 --> 01:40:05.966
ASSEMBLY MEMBER --

01:40:06.033 --> 01:40:07.134
MCCARTY --

01:40:07.201 --> 01:40:08.602
AUTHORED AND TOOK THE LEAD ON WE

01:40:08.669 --> 01:40:09.703
STARTED ADMINISTERING THE EVERY

01:40:09.770 --> 01:40:11.705
KID COUNTS PROGRAM WHICH IS WERE

01:40:11.772 --> 01:40:13.307
REACHING OUT TO CITIES LIKE SAN

01:40:13.374 --> 01:40:15.509
FRANCISCO SACRAMENTO'S GETTING

01:40:15.576 --> 01:40:16.543
ONE SET UP.

01:40:16.610 --> 01:40:18.011
ON IN MY CITY WEST SACRAMENTO

01:40:18.078 --> 01:40:20.280
THEY HAVEN'T CALLED HOME RUN

01:40:20.347 --> 01:40:21.348
BECAUSE ON LOW INCOME FAMILIES

01:40:21.415 --> 01:40:23.350
IN PARTICULAR AND THE IDEA IS

01:40:23.417 --> 01:40:24.752
THAT WHEN THE STUDENT ENTERS.

01:40:24.818 --> 01:40:27.221
KINDERGARTEN OR SCHOOL THE CITY

01:40:27.287 --> 01:40:28.722
SAYS HEY YOU WE'RE GONNA HELP

01:40:28.789 --> 01:40:30.357
YOU OPEN A SAVINGS ACCOUNT WILL

01:40:30.424 --> 01:40:31.325
PUT A LITTLE BIT IN TO BEGIN

01:40:31.392 --> 01:40:33.627
WITH AND THEN WE CAN MATCH SOME

01:40:33.694 --> 01:40:35.095
THAT YOU PUT IN EVERY YEAR.

01:40:35.162 --> 01:40:36.630
OR WHATEVER IT IS EVEN IF IT'S

01:40:36.697 --> 01:40:39.066
JUST A SMALL AMOUNT AND AS

01:40:39.133 --> 01:40:40.734
MISTER SHERMAN MENTION THE

01:40:40.801 --> 01:40:42.369
IMPORTANT THING WITH THE COLLEGE

01:40:42.436 --> 01:40:43.737
SAVINGS ACCOUNTS IS THE REACH

01:40:43.804 --> 01:40:45.439
AND ENSURING THAT THAT GETS.

01:40:45.506 --> 01:40:46.373
TO SOME OF THE LOWER INCOME

01:40:46.440 --> 01:40:48.275
FAMILIES WHO SIMPLY MAY NOT HAVE

01:40:48.342 --> 01:40:49.610
THE RESOURCES TO SET UP THAT

01:40:49.676 --> 01:40:52.212
SAVINGS ACCOUNT BUT ALSO TO YOUR

01:40:52.279 --> 01:40:53.747
POINT ABOUT THE TOTAL COST WHEN

01:40:53.814 --> 01:40:55.749
THAT STUDENT GETS TO COLLEGE IF

01:40:55.816 --> 01:40:56.517
THEY HAVE THAT MONEY THAT

01:40:56.583 --> 01:40:57.317
SAVINGS ACCOUNT.

01:40:57.384 --> 01:41:00.020
THEN THAT IS THAT IS GOES

01:41:00.087 --> 01:41:01.288
TOWARDS THEIR TOTAL FINANCING

01:41:01.355 --> 01:41:02.623
IT'S NOT JUST.

01:41:02.689 --> 01:41:03.524
THE STATE OR THE GOVERNMENT

01:41:03.590 --> 01:41:04.658
COVERING THE WHOLE THING IF THEY

01:41:04.725 --> 01:41:06.126
IF THEY DO HAVE SAVINGS THAT SET

01:41:06.193 --> 01:41:08.028
ASIDE FOR COLLEGE.

01:41:08.095 --> 01:41:10.898
THEN THEY CAN RELY ON THAT AS

01:41:10.964 --> 01:41:15.135
WELL. TO THANK YOU.

01:41:15.202 --> 01:41:17.471
I I HAD ONE MORE AT MAYBE I

01:41:17.538 --> 01:41:18.672
WANNA KNOWLEDGE A COUPLE THINGS

01:41:18.739 --> 01:41:19.306
FIRST -- I

01:41:19.373 --> 01:41:20.207
THINK SOME OF THE DISCUSSION

01:41:20.274 --> 01:41:21.742
THAT WE'RE HAVING HERE THIS

01:41:21.809 --> 01:41:24.478
MORNING GOES TO WHETHER --

01:41:24.545 --> 01:41:26.947
HIGHER EDUCATION IS A A PRIVATE

01:41:27.014 --> 01:41:28.882
OR PUBLIC GOOD AND I THINK WE

01:41:28.949 --> 01:41:31.018
ALL ACKNOWLEDGE HERE --

01:41:31.084 --> 01:41:32.719
THAT HIGHER EDUCATION IS A

01:41:32.786 --> 01:41:34.188
PUBLIC GOOD SO IT IS NOT JUST

01:41:34.254 --> 01:41:35.989
THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE

01:41:36.056 --> 01:41:38.926
INDIVIDUAL BUT THAT WE REACH

01:41:38.992 --> 01:41:40.427
THAT WE READ.

01:41:40.494 --> 01:41:43.497
AS A AS A STATE AS AN ECONOMY OF

01:41:43.564 --> 01:41:45.566
FROM THE FRUITS OF THOSE --

01:41:45.632 --> 01:41:50.137
THE ECONOMIC AND AJ GRADUATE THE

01:41:50.204 --> 01:41:51.605
BUILDS ON THE ECONOMY OF

01:41:51.672 --> 01:41:53.207
CALIFORNIA.

01:41:53.273 --> 01:41:54.408
AND I ALSO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE

01:41:54.475 --> 01:41:56.510
HOW THINGS HAVE CHANGED WHEN MY

01:41:56.577 --> 01:41:59.346
FATHER CAME TO THIS COUNTRY FROM --

01:41:59.413 --> 01:42:01.448
PANAMA IN NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT

01:42:01.515 --> 01:42:04.451
TO GO TO SCHOOL HE WAS ABLE. TO

01:42:04.518 --> 01:42:07.087
WORK IN THE SUMMER CATALINA AS A

01:42:07.154 --> 01:42:07.921
BELL HOP.

01:42:07.988 --> 01:42:10.123
OR WORK DURING THE SCHOOL YEAR

01:42:10.190 --> 01:42:11.458
WHEN HE WAS ATTENDING SAN JOSE

01:42:11.525 --> 01:42:12.893
STATE -- IN

01:42:12.960 --> 01:42:14.895
THE CANNERIES TO PAY FOR HIS

01:42:14.962 --> 01:42:17.931
TUITION AND SUPPORT HIS FAMILY.

01:42:17.998 --> 01:42:18.966
MYSELF AND MY SISTER AND OUR

01:42:19.032 --> 01:42:20.801
MOTHER.

01:42:20.868 --> 01:42:22.069
I WORK IN THE CANNERIES BUT

01:42:22.135 --> 01:42:25.372
DEFINITELY THOSE TIMES ARE GOT --

01:42:25.439 --> 01:42:27.407
AND IF THAT IS NOT --

01:42:27.474 --> 01:42:29.076
ANY ANYWHERE NEAR WITH THE

01:42:29.142 --> 01:42:31.612
REALITY IS AND TO THAT I WANT TO

01:42:31.678 --> 01:42:33.881
ASK A QUESTION IF.

01:42:33.947 --> 01:42:36.383
YOU SEE STUDENTS AND THE AMOUNT

01:42:36.450 --> 01:42:38.719
THAT THEY'RE EXPECTED LOW INCOME

01:42:38.785 --> 01:42:40.487
UC STUDENTS.

01:42:40.554 --> 01:42:41.021
AND THE AMOUNT THAT THEIR

01:42:41.088 --> 01:42:44.925
FAMILIES AND THEY ARE.

01:42:44.992 --> 01:42:46.326
EXPECTED TO CONTRIBUTE.

01:42:46.393 --> 01:42:48.996
ARE THOSE REASONABLE I I I HEAR

01:42:49.062 --> 01:42:50.797
FROM A LOT OF THE STUDENTS THAT

01:42:50.864 --> 01:42:52.599
THAT IS MORE THAN THEIR FAMILIES

01:42:52.666 --> 01:42:53.767
CAN.

01:42:53.834 --> 01:42:55.602
ACTUALLY AFFORD --

01:42:55.669 --> 01:42:57.938
THE CONTRIBUTION AND THE AMOUNT

01:42:58.005 --> 01:42:59.506
OF WORK THAT THEY ARE ASKED TO

01:42:59.573 --> 01:43:01.141
DO.

01:43:01.208 --> 01:43:01.842
YOU KNOW --

01:43:01.909 --> 01:43:04.745
THE TIME THAT IT TAKES FOR THEM --

01:43:04.811 --> 01:43:06.046
TO IN THAT AMOUNT OF MONEY.

01:43:06.113 --> 01:43:09.449
TIME OUT OF SCHOOL WORKING SO

01:43:09.516 --> 01:43:11.385
THAT REASONABLE TO EXPECT THE

01:43:11.451 --> 01:43:12.920
LOWEST --

01:43:12.986 --> 01:43:15.522
EARNING FAMILIES TO CONTRIBUTE

01:43:15.589 --> 01:43:16.490
BECAUSE I HEAR FROM STUDENTS

01:43:16.557 --> 01:43:19.593
THAT IT'S NOT.

01:43:19.660 --> 01:43:20.994
I'M I WOULD SAY I THINK THERE'S

01:43:21.061 --> 01:43:22.496
REASON TO QUESTION WHETHER IT

01:43:22.563 --> 01:43:23.597
REALLY IS I THINK THE U. I

01:43:23.664 --> 01:43:24.865
MENTIONED BEFORE THE UNIVERSITY

01:43:24.932 --> 01:43:26.233
OF CALIFORNIA EFM THEIR

01:43:26.300 --> 01:43:27.768
EDUCATION FINANCE MODEL.

01:43:27.834 --> 01:43:29.236
AND IT'S BUILT ON A PRINCIPLE

01:43:29.303 --> 01:43:30.771
THAT STUDENTS ACROSS ALL INCOME

01:43:30.837 --> 01:43:33.840
RANGES SHOULD CONTRIBUTE THE

01:43:33.907 --> 01:43:34.942
SAME AMOUNT IT'S ROUGHLY ABOUT

01:43:35.008 --> 01:43:35.976
TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR

01:43:36.043 --> 01:43:37.744
AND THAT CAN BE FROM WORK THAT

01:43:37.811 --> 01:43:38.178
COULD BE FROM DEBT.

01:43:38.245 --> 01:43:39.246
NOW.

01:43:39.313 --> 01:43:40.080
IF IT IS TRUE THAT THAT'S

01:43:40.147 --> 01:43:41.448
INEQUITABLE APPROACH THAN YOU

01:43:41.515 --> 01:43:43.650
WOULD SEE EQUAL LEVELS OF

01:43:43.717 --> 01:43:44.785
BORROWING SOME STUDENTS IN EACH

01:43:44.851 --> 01:43:46.353
INCOME CATEGORY WHICH USED TO

01:43:46.420 --> 01:43:47.521
BORROW SOME WHICH IS TO WORK.

01:43:47.588 --> 01:43:48.522
BUT THE TWIST IT SHOULD BE

01:43:48.589 --> 01:43:50.591
ROUGHLY SIMILAR BUT WE DON'T SEE

01:43:50.657 --> 01:43:52.125
THAT BECAUSE WE ARE SEEN YOUR

01:43:52.192 --> 01:43:53.327
THREE QUARTERS OF THE LOWEST

01:43:53.393 --> 01:43:54.595
INCOME STUDENTS.

01:43:54.661 --> 01:43:56.296
LEAVING SCHOOL WITH THAT MUCH

01:43:56.363 --> 01:43:57.764
HIGHER SHARE THAN ANY OTHER

01:43:57.831 --> 01:43:59.132
INCOME GROUP SO SOMETHING

01:43:59.199 --> 01:44:00.834
SOMETHING ABOUT THAT MODEL IS

01:44:00.901 --> 01:44:03.103
NOT WORKING AND IT COULD BE THAT

01:44:03.170 --> 01:44:04.204
STUDENTS HAVE IN THAT INCOME

01:44:04.271 --> 01:44:05.839
RANGE HAVE A HARDER TIME ACCESS

01:44:05.906 --> 01:44:06.573
SEEN.

01:44:06.640 --> 01:44:08.609
GOOD JOB SOLID JOBS OR MAYBE

01:44:08.675 --> 01:44:09.843
JOBS THAT MAKE ABOVE MINIMUM

01:44:09.910 --> 01:44:10.877
WAGE.

01:44:10.944 --> 01:44:12.346
IT COULD BE THAT --

01:44:12.412 --> 01:44:13.747
THOSE STUDENTS ARE HAVING TO

01:44:13.814 --> 01:44:14.815
CONTRIBUTE TO THEIR FAMILIES

01:44:14.881 --> 01:44:15.682
RIGHT NOT THAT THEIR FAMILIES

01:44:15.749 --> 01:44:16.950
CONTRIBUTED TO THEM THEY'RE

01:44:17.017 --> 01:44:18.318
CONTRIBUTING TO THEIR FAMILIES

01:44:18.385 --> 01:44:19.653
WHICH MAKES LESS OF THEIR

01:44:19.720 --> 01:44:21.054
EARNINGS AVAILABLE FOR SCHOOL

01:44:21.121 --> 01:44:22.022
COSTS -- IT

01:44:22.089 --> 01:44:23.924
COULD BE ANY ONE OF A NUMBER OF

01:44:23.991 --> 01:44:24.658
ISSUES THAT COULD BE THAT THE

01:44:24.725 --> 01:44:26.226
COSTS THAT ARE ESTIMATED BY THE

01:44:26.293 --> 01:44:27.995
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA THAT'S

01:44:28.061 --> 01:44:29.563
ACTUALLY SENDING THEIR FINANCIAL

01:44:29.630 --> 01:44:31.531
AID ELIGIBILITY ARE INADEQUATE --

01:44:31.598 --> 01:44:33.100
BUT I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT I THINK

01:44:33.166 --> 01:44:33.834
YOU'RE ON TO SOMETHING THAT

01:44:33.900 --> 01:44:35.736
THERE IS A PROBLEM IT'S SHOWING

01:44:35.802 --> 01:44:37.938
UP IN OUR LOW INCOME STUDENTS

01:44:38.005 --> 01:44:40.007
AND IT NEEDS MORE EXPLORATION.

01:44:40.073 --> 01:44:41.041
HOW DO I WOULD WE --

01:44:41.108 --> 01:44:42.242

01:44:42.309 --> 01:44:43.977
FOR THOSE STUDENTS.

01:44:44.044 --> 01:44:48.115
LIKE WHAT CAN WE DO --

01:44:48.181 --> 01:44:49.549
ONE OPTION WOULD BE TO INCREASE

01:44:49.616 --> 01:44:51.018
THE FINANCIAL AID FOR THE LOWEST

01:44:51.084 --> 01:44:51.952

01:45:01.461 --> 01:45:02.029
AND WHAT THE STUDENT COMMISSION

01:45:02.095 --> 01:45:05.198
DOES BOTH TYPES OF GRANTS AS

01:45:05.265 --> 01:45:06.633
THEY GIVE THE STUDENT ONE THAT'S

01:45:06.700 --> 01:45:08.802
MOST VALUABLE TO THEM --

01:45:08.869 --> 01:45:10.037
YOU KNOW SO RIGHT NOW THAT WOULD

01:45:10.103 --> 01:45:11.738
BE THE CAL GRANT A AWARD IF WE

01:45:11.805 --> 01:45:13.240
INCREASE THE CAL GRANT BE ACCESS

01:45:13.306 --> 01:45:15.308
AWARD MORE OF THEM WOULD GET CAL

GRANT THE AWARDS AND WE WOULD

01:45:16.677 --> 01:45:17.244

PRINCIPLES THAT POLICYMAKERS ARE

01:47:50.831 --> 01:47:52.365
DISCUSSING IN THE CONTEXT OF CAL

01:47:52.432 --> 01:47:54.000

01:48:10.717 --> 01:48:12.652
THREE WHERE WE EXPLAIN OUR

01:48:12.719 --> 01:48:13.753
PHILOSOPHY.

01:48:13.820 --> 01:48:14.788
WE BELIEVE THAT A PARTNERSHIP

WITH PARENTS STUDENTS AS WELL AS

SLIDE FOUR SHOWS THE FUNDING

01:48:25.265 --> 01:48:27.033
THAT OUR STUDENTS RECEIVE FROM

01:48:27.100 --> 01:48:28.835
THREE CRITICAL SOURCES THE CAL

01:48:28.902 --> 01:48:29.703
GRANTS.

01:48:29.769 --> 01:48:31.805
OUR OWN UC GRANTS AND PELL

01:48:31.872 --> 01:48:33.273
GRANTS.

01:48:33.340 --> 01:48:35.275
IN TERMS OF TOTAL FUNDING CAL

01:48:35.342 --> 01:48:36.576
GRANTS PROVIDE THE MOST SUPPORT

01:48:36.643 --> 01:48:38.078
ABOUT NINE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION

01:48:38.144 --> 01:48:39.613
DOLLARS.

01:48:39.679 --> 01:48:40.447
UC'S -- NEED

01:48:40.513 --> 01:48:42.382
BASED GRANT COMES IN SECOND AT

01:48:42.449 --> 01:48:43.884
ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION AND

01:48:43.950 --> 01:48:45.385
THE PELL GRANT FOR COMPARISON IS

01:48:45.452 --> 01:48:46.953
ABOUT HALF OF THAT ABOUT FOUR

01:48:47.020 --> 01:48:48.922
HUNDRED MILLION --

01:48:48.989 --> 01:48:50.056
PERHAPS MORE MOST IMPORTANTLY

01:48:50.123 --> 01:48:51.591
SLIGHT FIVE SHOWS HOW THOSE

01:48:51.658 --> 01:48:52.759
FUNDS HELP STUDENTS COVER

01:48:52.826 --> 01:48:55.262
TUITION AND FEES OR OTHER

01:48:55.328 --> 01:48:57.030
EDUCATIONAL EXPENSES.

01:48:57.097 --> 01:48:58.632
AS YOU CAN SEE CAL GRANTS ARE

01:48:58.698 --> 01:49:00.867
ESSENTIAL FOR YOU SEE STUDENTS

01:49:00.934 --> 01:49:01.635
AND COVERING THEIR TUITION AND

01:49:01.701 --> 01:49:03.536
FEES WHICH IS WHY MAINTAINING

01:49:03.603 --> 01:49:05.071
THE FOCUS ON TUITION AND FEES

01:49:05.138 --> 01:49:06.973
GOES A LONG WAY. TO DOING NO

01:49:07.040 --> 01:49:08.842
HARM TO OUR STUDENTS.

01:49:08.909 --> 01:49:10.043
AND AS YOU CAN SEE IN THE SLIDE

01:49:10.110 --> 01:49:11.845
IF FEET IT FREES UP HELL GRANT

01:49:11.912 --> 01:49:13.446
AND OUR OWN YOU SEE GRANT

01:49:13.513 --> 01:49:15.649
FUNDING TO HELP OFFSET NON BE

01:49:15.715 --> 01:49:16.883
EDUCATIONAL COSTS THAT STUDENTS

01:49:16.950 --> 01:49:18.184
FACE.

01:49:18.251 --> 01:49:19.386
THIS IS WHY WE AGREE WITH THE

01:49:19.452 --> 01:49:21.288
RESOLUTIONS OF THE CALIFORNIA

01:49:21.354 --> 01:49:22.589
STATE EIGHT COMMISSION AS ISSUED

01:49:22.656 --> 01:49:23.623
BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY THE

01:49:23.690 --> 01:49:25.292
RESOLUTION TO MAINTAIN AT A

01:49:25.358 --> 01:49:26.126
MINIMUM.

01:49:26.192 --> 01:49:27.894
COVERAGE OF TUITION AND FEES AT

01:49:27.961 --> 01:49:29.796
THE PUBLIC COLLEGES AND

01:49:29.863 --> 01:49:30.397
UNIVERSITIES IN THE CAL GRANT

01:49:30.463 --> 01:49:31.398
PROGRAM.

01:49:31.464 --> 01:49:32.198
BUT CAL GRANT PROGRAM WAS

01:49:32.265 --> 01:49:34.000
ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL IN KEEPING

01:49:34.067 --> 01:49:35.602
YOU SIX SENSIBLE TO LOW INCOME

01:49:35.669 --> 01:49:37.370
STUDENTS DURING AND FOLLOWING

01:49:37.437 --> 01:49:38.705
THE GREAT RECESSION.

01:49:38.772 --> 01:49:39.606
THIS IS BECAUSE CAL GRANT COVER

01:49:39.673 --> 01:49:42.008
TUITION AND FEE STUDENTS WHICH

01:49:42.075 --> 01:49:43.343
INCREASED DRAMATICALLY IN THOSE

01:49:43.410 --> 01:49:45.211
YEARS.

01:49:45.278 --> 01:49:46.680
I WANT TO UNDERSCORE THAT WE

01:49:46.746 --> 01:49:47.347
THINK THAT THE STATE HAS A

01:49:47.414 --> 01:49:49.115
WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD

01:49:49.182 --> 01:49:50.717
ON THE EXISTING SUCCESS OF THE

01:49:50.784 --> 01:49:52.719
CAL GRANT PROGRAMS WITHOUT A

01:49:52.786 --> 01:49:54.321
WHOLE SO RE ENGINEERING. FOR

01:49:54.387 --> 01:49:55.989
EXAMPLE SIMPLIFYING AND

01:49:56.056 --> 01:49:57.590
CONSOLIDATING THE PROGRAMS

01:49:57.657 --> 01:49:58.758
INCREASING THE CAL GRANT BE

01:49:58.825 --> 01:50:00.360
ACCESS AWARD.

01:50:00.427 --> 01:50:01.494
AND ELIMINATING THE BARRIERS FOR

01:50:01.561 --> 01:50:03.330
NONTRADITIONAL STUDENTS ARE ALL

01:50:03.396 --> 01:50:04.097
GREAT THINGS TO DO AND WOULD

01:50:04.164 --> 01:50:05.231
HAVE AN IMMEDIATE IMPACT ON

01:50:05.298 --> 01:50:06.766
CALIFORNIA'S STUDENTS.

01:50:06.833 --> 01:50:08.501
WE'RE ALSO VERY SUPPORTIVE OF

01:50:08.568 --> 01:50:10.337
THE RECOMMENDATION TO EXPAND CAL

01:50:10.403 --> 01:50:11.938
GRANT INTO SUMMER SESSION.

01:50:12.005 --> 01:50:13.907
AT UC ARE CHRIS DIDN'T GRADUATE

01:50:13.974 --> 01:50:16.009
ON AVERAGE IN FOUR YEARS

01:50:16.076 --> 01:50:17.744
ADEQUATE AND AND AND A TERM --

01:50:17.811 --> 01:50:18.912
SO IF THE STUDENTS COULD PULL

01:50:18.979 --> 01:50:20.280
TOGETHER A NEW YEAR ROUND HELL

01:50:20.347 --> 01:50:22.816
GRANT WITH THE SUMMER CAL GRANT

01:50:22.882 --> 01:50:23.950
THEY GRADUATE AND ENTER THE

01:50:24.017 --> 01:50:25.652
WORKFORCE EARLIER AND THAT WOULD

01:50:25.719 --> 01:50:26.987
FREE UP SPACE THAT YOU SEE IN

01:50:27.053 --> 01:50:28.455
THE FALL FOR ADDITIONAL

01:50:28.521 --> 01:50:30.056
CALIFORNIA STUDENTS.

01:50:30.123 --> 01:50:31.124
THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA

01:50:31.191 --> 01:50:32.559
WANTS TO BE YOUR PARTNERS IN

01:50:32.625 --> 01:50:33.493

CATEGORY VERY WELL.

01:55:32.258 --> 01:55:34.327
SECONDLY WE AGREE THAT THE FOCUS

01:55:34.394 --> 01:55:35.395
OF FINANCIAL AID SHOULD BE ON

01:55:35.461 --> 01:55:36.996
THE TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE AND

01:55:37.063 --> 01:55:38.965
IT SHOULD MAINTAIN FULL COVERAGE

OF TUITION AND FEES.

01:55:40.600 --> 01:55:41.968

01:55:55.214 --> 01:55:56.449
WE FULLY RECOGNIZE THAT TUITION

01:56:46.933 --> 01:56:49.068
YEARS.

01:56:49.135 --> 01:56:50.803
I'D LIKE TO CONCLUDE WITH A FEW

01:56:50.870 --> 01:56:52.171
CAUTIONARY NOTES.

01:56:52.238 --> 01:56:53.773
CHANGES TO THE CAR GRANT PROGRAM

01:56:53.840 --> 01:56:55.041
SHOULD NOT RESULT IN A

01:56:55.108 --> 01:56:56.743
REDISTRIBUTION OF RESOURCES AWAY

01:56:56.809 --> 01:56:58.945

UNIFORM WORK EXPECTATION FAMILY

01:57:03.349 --> 01:57:05.118
CONTRIBUTION WOULD BE HARMFUL TO

01:57:05.184 --> 01:57:06.619
OUR STUDENTS.

01:57:06.686 --> 01:57:08.588
THEY ARE ALREADY WORKING HARD TO

01:57:08.654 --> 01:57:09.522
SUPPORT THEIR FAMILIES AND

01:57:09.589 --> 01:57:10.823
EARNED A DEGREE.

01:57:10.890 --> 01:57:12.058
AND WE BELIEVE THAT MOVING TO A

01:57:12.125 --> 01:57:14.160
MODEL THAT FIRST FACTORS AND

01:57:14.227 --> 01:57:15.762
EXPECTED CONTRIBUTIONS AND THE

01:57:15.828 --> 01:57:17.530
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS WOULD ONLY

01:57:17.597 --> 01:57:18.931
HURT STUDENTS WHO ARE ALREADY

01:57:18.998 --> 01:57:20.933
STRUGGLING.

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:22.835
LASTLY WE URGE THAT ANY

01:57:22.902 --> 01:57:24.137
INCREASES IN THE BREATH OF

01:57:24.203 --> 01:57:25.705
FINANCIAL AID MUST BE PAIRED

01:57:25.772 --> 01:57:27.340
WITH INCREASES TO INSTITUTIONAL

01:57:27.407 --> 01:57:28.408
FUNDING.

01:57:28.474 --> 01:57:29.776
AS THE DEMAND FOR A CSU

01:57:29.842 --> 01:57:31.511
EDUCATION INCREASES TO TO

01:57:31.577 --> 01:57:32.945
REMOVING BARRIERS TO FINANCIAL

01:57:33.012 --> 01:57:34.313
AID.

01:57:34.380 --> 01:57:35.415
THE DEMAND FOR ENROLLMENT WILL

01:57:35.481 --> 01:57:37.016
INEVITABLY NEED TO INCREASE AS

01:57:37.083 --> 01:57:38.284
WELL.

01:57:38.351 --> 01:57:40.753
WITHOUT A CONSCIOUS PARTNERSHIP

01:57:40.820 --> 01:57:42.221

01:58:12.552 --> 01:58:13.920
IMPORTANT ISSUE.

01:58:13.986 --> 01:58:14.654
I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT A

01:58:14.720 --> 01:58:16.055
COLLEGE CREDENTIAL IS

01:58:16.122 --> 01:58:17.690
INCREASINGLY THE KEY FOR

CALIFORNIANS TO UNLOCK SOCIAL

01:58:19.125 --> 01:58:21.627
MOBILITY AND ECONOMIC PROSPERITY.

01:58:21.694 --> 01:58:23.095
A STUDENT'S ABILITY TO AFFORD

01:58:23.162 --> 01:58:24.664
THE TUITION AND NON TUITION

01:58:24.730 --> 01:58:26.199
COSTS OF COLLEGE PLAY A MAJOR

01:58:26.265 --> 01:58:29.101
ROLE IN THEIR DECISION TO ATTEND.

01:58:29.168 --> 01:58:31.304
AND THEIR ABILITY TO GRADUATE.

01:58:31.370 --> 01:58:32.371
THE MASTER PLAN FOR HIGHER

01:58:32.438 --> 01:58:33.573
EDUCATION PROVIDES A DEEP

01:58:33.639 --> 01:58:36.209
COMMITMENT TO COLLEGE ACCESS.

01:58:36.275 --> 01:58:39.178
BUT IT REINFORCES TOO DEEPLY

01:58:39.245 --> 01:58:40.613
CONCERNING INEQUITIES.

01:58:40.680 --> 01:58:42.648
FIRST COMMUNITY COLLEGES SERVE

01:58:42.715 --> 01:58:44.016
THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF LOW INCOME

01:58:44.083 --> 01:58:45.351
STUDENTS BUT WE RECEIVE THE

01:58:45.418 --> 01:58:46.853
LOWEST PER STUDENT FUNDING LEVEL

01:58:46.919 --> 01:58:48.254

LITTLE AID TO MEET THEIR BASIC

01:59:01.434 --> 01:59:03.636

POLICY MAKERS IN THE STATE HAVE

01:59:38.304 --> 01:59:39.972
WORKED VERY HARD TO ENSURE THAT

01:59:40.039 --> 01:59:41.674
TUITION IS NOT A BARRIER FOR

01:59:41.741 --> 01:59:42.942
STUDENTS IN OUR SYSTEM AND WE

01:59:43.009 --> 01:59:44.343
SHOULD CELEBRATE THAT WORK THE

01:59:44.410 --> 01:59:45.978
CALIFORNIA COLLEGE PROMISE GRANT

01:59:46.045 --> 01:59:47.647

ANOTHER TWENTY THOUSAND STUDENTS.

02:00:10.536 --> 02:00:11.637
AND FOR THOSE STUDENTS WHO DO

02:00:22.181 --> 02:00:23.950
TIME.

02:00:24.016 --> 02:00:25.217
BUT THE TOTAL COST TO ATTEND A

02:00:25.284 --> 02:00:27.186
CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE IS

02:00:27.253 --> 02:00:28.754
MUCH MUCH MORE THAN TUITION.

THOUSAND DOLLARS ANNUALLY.

02:00:33.793 --> 02:00:35.428
AND BECAUSE SO LITTLE GRANT AID

02:00:35.494 --> 02:00:37.129
IS AVAILABLE TO COVER THOSE NON

02:00:51.344 --> 02:00:53.212
FINANCIAL AID IS A KEY COMPONENT

02:00:53.279 --> 02:00:54.680

02:04:00.099 --> 02:04:02.268
WHAT MAKES THE KALRA UNIQUE IS

02:04:02.334 --> 02:04:03.068
THAT IT WAS ESTABLISHED AT A

02:04:03.135 --> 02:04:04.904
TIME WHEN CALIFORNIA WAS GROWING

02:04:04.970 --> 02:04:06.806

02:04:28.294 --> 02:04:29.995
IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE STATE'S

02:04:30.062 --> 02:04:31.397

02:04:31.463 --> 02:04:32.765
THAT STORY CONTINUES TO BE TRUE

02:04:32.832 --> 02:04:33.933
TODAY.

02:04:33.999 --> 02:04:35.000
THE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN

02:04:35.067 --> 02:04:36.735
COMMUNITY COLLEGES THE FOR YOUR

02:04:36.802 --> 02:04:38.270
PUBLIC AND THE PRIVATE NONPROFIT

02:04:38.337 --> 02:04:39.738
SECTORS.

FINANCIALLY.

02:04:54.420 --> 02:04:55.521
AND WHAT'S WILL PROVIDE THE

02:04:55.588 --> 02:04:57.323
SUPPORT NECESSARY FOR THEIR

02:04:57.389 --> 02:04:58.958
SUCCESS.

02:04:59.024 --> 02:05:00.726
AS WE ALL KNOW THE COST OF

02:05:00.793 --> 02:05:02.228
COLLEGE CONTINUES TO INCREASE

02:05:02.294 --> 02:05:04.463
AND STUDENT SUPPORT IS CRITICAL.

02:05:04.530 --> 02:05:05.731
MUCH OF OUR DISCUSSION TODAY

02:05:05.798 --> 02:05:07.032
REVOLVES AROUND ON TUITION

02:05:07.099 --> 02:05:08.601
EXPENSES SUCH AS BOOKS AND

02:05:08.667 --> 02:05:10.569
SUPPLIES ROOM BOARD AND OTHERS

02:05:10.636 --> 02:05:12.071
THAT ARE CONSIDERED EDUCATIONAL

02:05:12.137 --> 02:05:14.273
COSTS FOR THE PURPOSES OF NEED

02:05:14.340 --> 02:05:15.541
BASED FINANCIAL IT.

02:05:15.608 --> 02:05:17.676
IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE

02:05:17.743 --> 02:05:19.612
STUDENTS NON TWITCHING COSTS ARE

02:05:19.678 --> 02:05:21.113
SIMILAR IN EVERY SECTOR.

02:05:21.180 --> 02:05:22.181
THE PRIMARY DIFFERENCES IN THE

02:05:22.248 --> 02:05:23.983
TUITION COSTS WHICH IS SUPPORTED

02:05:24.049 --> 02:05:26.518
BY TUITION AND ELEMENT AND GIVES

02:05:26.585 --> 02:05:27.453
OF THE INDEPENDENT SECTOR AND

02:05:27.519 --> 02:05:30.089
TAXPAYER SUBSIDIES AND EXTERNAL

02:05:30.155 --> 02:05:32.358
SUPPORT IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR.

02:05:32.424 --> 02:05:33.659
WE ALSO KNOW THAT A LOW INCOME

02:05:33.726 --> 02:05:35.794
STUDENT IS A LOW INCOME STUDENT

02:05:35.861 --> 02:05:37.062
NO MATTER WHERE THEY A TON TO

02:05:37.129 --> 02:05:38.364
CHOOSE COLLEGE.

02:05:38.430 --> 02:05:39.899
THEIR SOCIAL ECONOMIC REALITY IN

02:05:39.965 --> 02:05:41.433
CHALLENGES FOLLOW THEM WHEREVER

02:05:41.500 --> 02:05:43.002
THEY ATTENDED I ENCOURAGE YOU TO

02:05:43.068 --> 02:05:43.936
THINK ABOUT.

02:05:44.003 --> 02:05:45.571
THE IMPROVEMENTS DISCUSSED TODAY

02:05:45.638 --> 02:05:47.273
IN THE CONTEXT OF TREATING ALL

02:05:47.339 --> 02:05:48.440
STUDENTS EQUITABLY.

02:05:48.507 --> 02:05:49.742
AND ENSURING THAT WITH ANY

02:05:49.808 --> 02:05:52.344
CHANGES WE SEEK TO BUILD UPON

02:05:52.411 --> 02:05:52.878
THE STRENGTH OF THE COBRA

02:05:52.945 --> 02:05:55.014
PROGRAM AND DO NO HARM TO

02:05:55.080 --> 02:05:57.483
STUDENTS.

02:05:57.549 --> 02:05:59.018
OUR SECTOR INVESTS HEAVILY IN

02:05:59.084 --> 02:06:00.419
OUR STUDENTS AND ON ROMAN A

02:06:00.486 --> 02:06:02.288
FLOOD REFLECTS THE DIVERSITY OF

02:06:02.354 --> 02:06:03.856
CALIFORNIA.

02:06:03.923 --> 02:06:04.790
WE SPEND APPROXIMATELY TWO

02:06:04.857 --> 02:06:06.725
BILLION DOLLARS IN INSTITUTIONAL

02:06:06.792 --> 02:06:07.660
EIGHT EACH YEAR PROVIDING AN

02:06:07.726 --> 02:06:09.161
AVERAGE OF NINETEEN THOUSAND

02:06:09.228 --> 02:06:10.763
DOLLARS IN INSTITUTIONAL GROUNDS

02:06:10.829 --> 02:06:12.298
TO EACH KALRA RECIPIENT.

02:06:12.364 --> 02:06:13.899
WE STRIVE TO MAINTAIN FINANCIAL

02:06:13.966 --> 02:06:15.834
AID PROGRAMS THE BALANCE LOAN

02:06:15.901 --> 02:06:17.102
AND WORK WITH BROWN'S.

02:06:17.169 --> 02:06:18.537
CALIFORNIA STUDENTS GRADUATE

02:06:18.604 --> 02:06:20.539
WITH APPROXIMATELY TWENTY THREE

02:06:20.606 --> 02:06:21.774
THOUSAND DOLLARS IN STUDENT AT A

02:06:21.840 --> 02:06:24.243
GRADUATION PLACING US FORTIETH

02:06:24.310 --> 02:06:25.945
IN THE NATION.

02:06:26.011 --> 02:06:27.479
AT US SUIT THE AVERAGE STUDENT --

02:06:27.546 --> 02:06:29.782

02:06:29.848 --> 02:06:30.282
TWENTY TWO THOUSAND THE

02:06:30.349 --> 02:06:31.317
CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT SECTOR OF

02:06:31.383 --> 02:06:35.521
WHICH IS APPROXIMATELY.

02:06:35.587 --> 02:06:36.055
TWENTY NINE THOUSAND FOUR

02:06:36.121 --> 02:06:36.655
HUNDRED OUR SECTORS FOUR YEAR

AVERAGE GRADUATION RATE IS 61%.

02:06:39.224 --> 02:06:42.294
AND AT USC OR SECURE RATE IS 92%.

02:06:42.361 --> 02:06:43.429
BUT I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT

02:06:43.495 --> 02:06:44.263
THAT OUR FOREIGN SECURE

02:06:44.330 --> 02:06:45.564
GRADUATION RATES FOR CAL GRANT

02:06:45.631 --> 02:06:48.000
RECIPIENTS IS HIGHER THAN THE

02:06:48.067 --> 02:06:49.168
OVERALL AVERAGE.

02:06:49.234 --> 02:06:50.970
WHEN STUDENTS GRADUATE EARLIER

02:06:51.036 --> 02:06:52.371
THE COST TO REDUCE THEY BORROW

02:06:52.438 --> 02:06:54.106
US AND THEY'RE ABLE TO ENTER THE

02:06:54.173 --> 02:06:56.375
WORK FORCE SOONER WITH THEIR NEW

02:06:56.442 --> 02:06:57.743
EARNING POTENTIAL?

02:06:57.810 --> 02:06:59.044
WHILE IT IS TRUE THE CALIFORNIA

02:06:59.111 --> 02:07:00.245
HAS LONG BEEN CONSIDERED A

02:07:00.312 --> 02:07:01.680
LEADER IN THE NATION IN HIGHER

02:07:01.747 --> 02:07:03.248
EDUCATION THE PROMISE OF EQUAL

02:07:03.315 --> 02:07:04.817
OPPORTUNITY IS THE ROAD AND AS

02:07:04.883 --> 02:07:05.985
WE SEE ISSUES IN COLLEGE

02:07:06.051 --> 02:07:07.219
COMPLETION AN ACCESS TO HIGHER

02:07:07.286 --> 02:07:09.655
EDUCATION. FOR OUR LOWEST INCOME

02:07:09.722 --> 02:07:09.922
STUDENTS.

02:07:09.989 --> 02:07:13.158
THE CALVET WRONG GETS GROANING

02:07:13.225 --> 02:07:15.060
COMPLEXITY IS NOT SERVING ALL

02:07:15.127 --> 02:07:16.628
STUDENTS AS WELL AS IT SHOULD.

02:07:16.695 --> 02:07:18.097
WITH THE RECENT ECONOMIC GROWTH

02:07:18.163 --> 02:07:19.865
OF OUR STATE AND A STABLE BUDGET

02:07:19.932 --> 02:07:21.633
THIS IS A GOOD TIME TO EVALUATE

02:07:21.700 --> 02:07:23.535
EVALUATE OUR POLICIES.

02:07:23.602 --> 02:07:24.970
AT A HIGHER LEVEL AND CONSIDER

02:07:25.037 --> 02:07:27.840
THE TIME RIGHT FOR MAJOR REFORM.

02:07:27.906 --> 02:07:29.074
WE SUPPORT THE PROPOSAL TO

02:07:29.141 --> 02:07:30.442
REINSTITUTE A FORMULA FOR

02:07:30.509 --> 02:07:32.077
DETERMINING THE CAL GRANT AWARD

02:07:32.144 --> 02:07:32.811
FOR STUDENTS ATTEND AN

02:07:32.878 --> 02:07:35.214
INDEPENDENT NONPROFIT SCHOOLS.

02:07:35.280 --> 02:07:36.482
THERE'S BEEN NO INCREASE IN

02:07:36.548 --> 02:07:38.650
ALMOST TWENTY YEARS EQUATING TO

02:07:38.717 --> 02:07:40.085
NEARLY 50% REDUCTION OF

02:07:40.152 --> 02:07:41.387
PURCHASING POWER.

02:07:41.453 --> 02:07:42.588
EACH YEAR FUNDING HAS BEEN

02:07:42.654 --> 02:07:44.490
VULNERABLE AS THE BUDGET PROCESS

02:07:44.556 --> 02:07:46.291
UNFOLDS AT A TIME THAT STUDENTS

02:07:46.358 --> 02:07:47.626
NEED TO KNOW WHAT SUPPORT THEY

02:07:47.693 --> 02:07:49.028
WILL RECEIVE AND CREATING

02:07:49.094 --> 02:07:51.797
UNCERTAINTY FOR STUDENTS AND THE

02:07:51.864 --> 02:07:53.198
INSTITUTIONS THAT SORT OF THEM.

02:07:53.265 --> 02:07:54.199
THE LACK OF PREDICTABILITY AND

02:07:54.266 --> 02:07:55.334
DECLINING VALUE MAKE IT LESS

02:07:55.401 --> 02:07:57.202
ATTRACTIVE TO FAMILIES AND

02:07:57.269 --> 02:07:59.204
AFFECTS THE CHOICES THEY MAKE.

02:07:59.271 --> 02:08:01.106
THIS HAS AN IMPACT ON THE AROMA

02:08:01.173 --> 02:08:02.274
OF THE STUDENTS OUR SECTOR WHERE

02:08:02.341 --> 02:08:03.842
THERE IS CAPACITY TO SUPPORT AND

02:08:03.909 --> 02:08:07.212
SORT OF THEM. FOR EXAMPLE SINCE

02:08:07.279 --> 02:08:07.780
TWO THOUSAND ONE THE CSU HAS

02:08:07.846 --> 02:08:09.515
SEEN A TWO HUNDRED AND 27%

02:08:09.581 --> 02:08:10.983
INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF CAL

02:08:11.050 --> 02:08:12.151
GRANT RECIPIENTS.

02:08:12.217 --> 02:08:14.686
UC AT A HUNDRED AND 6% WHILE THE

02:08:14.753 --> 02:08:15.888
PERCENTAGE OF CAL GRANT

02:08:15.954 --> 02:08:18.157
RECIPIENTS AT I CC YOU

02:08:18.223 --> 02:08:20.559
INSTITUTIONS HAS INCREASE JUST

02:08:20.626 --> 02:08:21.527
18%.

02:08:21.593 --> 02:08:23.195
WE BELIEVE THAT ARBITRARY

02:08:23.262 --> 02:08:24.797
BARRIERS TO CAL GRANT AWARDS

02:08:24.863 --> 02:08:25.564
WILL BE ADDRESS SUCH AS AGING

ALSO QUALIFICATIONS.

02:08:30.302 --> 02:08:32.304

COMPETITIVE CAL GRANTS IS

02:08:33.372 --> 02:08:35.707

THE NUMBER OFFERED HAS ONLY

02:08:37.509 --> 02:08:39.278
INCREASED 14%.

02:08:39.344 --> 02:08:40.946
STEPS WILL BE TAKEN TO SIMPLIFY

02:08:41.013 --> 02:08:42.781
THE CAL GRANT TO MAKE IT EASIER

02:08:42.848 --> 02:08:44.683
FOR STUDENTS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT

02:08:44.750 --> 02:08:46.318
THEY ARE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE.

02:08:46.385 --> 02:08:48.020
EXAMPLES ARE THE DIFFERENCES AND

02:08:48.087 --> 02:08:50.456
CAL GRANT AMD QUALIFICATION OUT

02:08:50.522 --> 02:08:51.857

02:08:58.464 --> 02:09:01.300
OF OUR ROTC EVEN VETERANS

02:09:01.366 --> 02:09:02.534
BENEFITS WHICH MEET THEIR

02:09:02.601 --> 02:09:04.870
TUITION COSTS SO THEY ARE NOT

02:09:04.937 --> 02:09:06.338
ABLE TO RECEIVE A CAGR OUT WHICH

02:09:06.405 --> 02:09:08.006
THEY MAY BE QUALIFIED.

02:09:08.073 --> 02:09:09.341
FOR EXPANDING ELIGIBILITY TO

02:09:09.408 --> 02:09:11.043
SUMMER COULD HELP STUDENTS STAY

02:09:11.110 --> 02:09:12.511
ON TRACK TO GRADUATE ON TIME OR

02:09:12.578 --> 02:09:13.612
EVEN AHEAD OF TIME.

02:09:13.679 --> 02:09:14.980
ALLOWING THEM TO REDUCE THEIR

02:09:15.047 --> 02:09:17.116
EDUCATIONAL EXPENSES AND OUGHT

02:09:17.182 --> 02:09:18.717
TO LAY AND IN THE WORK FORCE.

02:09:18.784 --> 02:09:20.752
WITH THE RETURN OF YOUR OWN CALL

02:09:20.819 --> 02:09:22.588
THE SUPPORT COULD BE INVALUABLE.

02:09:22.654 --> 02:09:23.956
AS MENTIONED EARLIER WE NEED TO

02:09:24.022 --> 02:09:25.457
CONTINUE TO ASSESS THE NEEDS OF

02:09:25.524 --> 02:09:26.758
STUDENTS FOR ALL OF THEIR

02:09:26.825 --> 02:09:28.627
EDUCATIONAL EXPENSES NOT JUST

02:09:28.694 --> 02:09:29.862
TUITION SUPPORT.

02:09:29.928 --> 02:09:30.863
UNDERSTANDING THE DIFFERENT

02:09:30.929 --> 02:09:33.198
METHODS OF EVALUATING THE IT AND

02:09:33.265 --> 02:09:35.634
AWARDING A WILL SYSTEM PROVIDING

02:09:35.701 --> 02:09:36.735
POLICY MAKERS WITH A CLEARER

02:09:36.802 --> 02:09:38.770
UNDERSTANDING OF THE CHALLENGES

02:09:38.837 --> 02:09:40.239
THAT STUDENTS FAIRS.

02:09:40.305 --> 02:09:41.440
I HOPE THIS DISCUSSION HAS BEEN

02:09:41.507 --> 02:09:43.242
HELPFUL TO AND THAT YOU CAN SEE

02:09:43.308 --> 02:09:44.910
HOW OUR STUDENTS WOULD BENEFIT

02:09:44.977 --> 02:09:46.311
FROM A FUNDING FORMULA.

02:09:46.378 --> 02:09:47.679
IT WOULD PROVIDE PREDICTABILITY

02:09:47.746 --> 02:09:49.148
THAT WOULD REDUCE ANXIETY OVER

02:09:49.214 --> 02:09:51.183
FUTURE FUNDING AND A STATEMENT

02:09:51.250 --> 02:09:52.651
OF EQUITY FOR STUDENTS THAT THEY

02:09:52.718 --> 02:09:54.186
ARE VALUED EQUALLY IN OUR

02:09:54.253 --> 02:09:55.754
EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM.

02:09:55.821 --> 02:09:56.855
ASSURING THEM THAT IS THE STATE

02:09:56.922 --> 02:09:58.223
INCREASES INVESTMENT IN THE

02:09:58.290 --> 02:09:59.892
PUBLIC SECTOR THERE WOULD ALSO

02:09:59.958 --> 02:10:01.426
BE MODEST GROWTH IN THE STATE'S

02:10:01.493 --> 02:10:02.895
INVESTMENT AND THEIR SUCCESS.

02:10:02.961 --> 02:10:04.163
AND IT WOULD ALLOW THE STUDENTS

02:10:04.229 --> 02:10:05.397
THE ABILITY TO ACCESS THE

02:10:05.464 --> 02:10:08.200
INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY OF OUR

02:10:08.267 --> 02:10:08.767
INSTITUTIONS THROUGHOUT THE

02:10:08.834 --> 02:10:09.601
STATE.

02:10:09.668 --> 02:10:11.303
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME

02:10:11.370 --> 02:10:11.603

02:10:11.670 --> 02:10:15.140
THANK YOU.

02:10:15.207 --> 02:10:15.908
THAT QUESTION TO THE

02:10:15.974 --> 02:10:17.442
REPRESENTATIVES OF THE YOU SEE

02:10:17.509 --> 02:10:19.444
AN AND CSU A REGARDING SUMMER

02:10:19.511 --> 02:10:20.646
SCHOOL --

02:10:20.712 --> 02:10:22.047
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE I'VE

02:10:22.114 --> 02:10:23.882
BEEN IN SCHOOL SO I I HAVE A

02:10:23.949 --> 02:10:25.117
QUESTION.

02:10:25.184 --> 02:10:28.620
IS SUMMER SCHOOL MORE EXPENSIVE

02:10:28.687 --> 02:10:30.222
TO STUDENTS NOW.

02:10:30.289 --> 02:10:31.857
IS THE COST OF ATTENDING SUMMER

02:10:31.924 --> 02:10:34.426
SESSION MORE THAN THE NORMAL

02:10:34.493 --> 02:10:36.361
OTHER --

02:10:36.428 --> 02:10:37.696
SEMESTERS OR QUARTERS TO THEM OR

02:10:37.763 --> 02:10:38.864
IS IT [inaudible]

02:10:38.931 --> 02:10:42.067
THE SAME.

02:10:42.134 --> 02:10:43.902
A FOR THE CSU IT'S ALMOST THE

02:10:43.969 --> 02:10:44.503
SAME.

02:10:44.570 --> 02:10:45.137
IT'S REALLY BASED ON HOW MANY

02:10:45.204 --> 02:10:46.672
STUDENTS ARE HOW MANY UNITS EACH

02:10:46.738 --> 02:10:48.273
OF THE STUDENTS ARE TAKING.

02:10:48.340 --> 02:10:49.341
A BIT OF THEIRMOST STUDENTS

02:10:49.408 --> 02:10:51.109
TAKE ABOUT SIX UNITS EACH SUMMER

02:10:51.176 --> 02:10:52.644
AND IT'S ROUGHLY ABOUT THE SAME

02:10:52.711 --> 02:10:55.480
COST OF THE REGULARS MASTER IN

02:10:55.547 --> 02:10:56.915
TERMS OF FEES.

02:10:56.982 --> 02:10:58.016
AND FOR THE UC FOR USE IT'S

02:10:58.083 --> 02:10:58.884
ABOUT THE SAME AGAIN IT'S BY

02:10:58.951 --> 02:10:59.618
CREDIT HOURS OF THE COSTS ARE

02:10:59.685 --> 02:11:01.320
DETERMINED DIFFERENTLY BUT IT'S

02:11:01.386 --> 02:11:02.788
MORE OR LESS THE SAME.

02:11:02.854 --> 02:11:04.089
COMPARABLE COMPARABLE.

02:11:04.156 --> 02:11:05.991
AND AS IT STANDS RIGHT NOW

02:11:06.058 --> 02:11:08.060
STUDENTS ARE NOT ABLE TO USE CAL

02:11:08.126 --> 02:11:10.696
GRANTS OF FOR SUMMER SCHOOL

02:11:10.762 --> 02:11:13.565
ATTENDANCE I CORRECT.

02:11:13.632 --> 02:11:15.734
WHAT THE STUDENTS BECAUSE --

02:11:15.801 --> 02:11:16.902
HAVE ATTENDED THE FLU THE YEAR

02:11:16.969 --> 02:11:19.471
PRIOR FOR EXAMPLE AT THE

02:11:19.538 --> 02:11:20.806
VIEWSTER OUT THERE ARE YEARS

02:11:20.872 --> 02:11:23.842
ALLOCATION OF CAL GRANT ALREADY --

02:11:23.909 --> 02:11:25.177
AND SO THEY HAVE THE FOUR YEARS

02:11:25.244 --> 02:11:26.545
OF CAL GRANT ELIGIBILITY IF WITH

02:11:26.612 --> 02:11:27.946
THEIR TEETH DURING THE SUMMER IT

02:11:28.013 --> 02:11:31.083
WOULD TAKE AWAY FROM THE FOUR

02:11:31.149 --> 02:11:32.284
YEARS SO THEY WOULDN'T IF THEY

02:11:32.351 --> 02:11:33.352
USE IT IN THE SUMMER THEY

02:11:33.418 --> 02:11:35.420

02:11:35.487 --> 02:11:37.589
THE REST OF IT WITH A FOUR YEARS

02:11:37.656 --> 02:11:39.024

AND SO IT DO YOU HAVE A

02:11:39.858 --> 02:11:42.494
RECOMMENDATION AS TO HOW MANY.

02:11:42.561 --> 02:11:45.097
SEMESTERS OF QUARTERS --

02:11:45.163 --> 02:11:47.499
WE SHOULD GRANT THEM STUDENTS TO

02:11:47.566 --> 02:11:49.268
BE ABLE TO USE --

02:11:49.334 --> 02:11:52.070

02:11:52.137 --> 02:11:53.605
CLASSES.

02:11:53.672 --> 02:11:54.106
WHAT THE UNIVERSITY OF

02:11:54.172 --> 02:11:54.940
CALIFORNIA FOR STUDENTS ARE

02:11:55.007 --> 02:11:57.109
GRADUATING IN FOUR YEARS ON

02:11:57.175 --> 02:11:59.378
AVERAGE WITH AN ADDITIONAL TERM?

02:11:59.444 --> 02:12:01.413
THEN A SUMMER OF CAL GRANT WOULD

02:12:01.480 --> 02:12:03.081
HELP THEM GET INTO THE JOB FORCE

02:12:03.148 --> 02:12:04.383
IN INTO THE INTO THE WORK FORCE

02:12:04.449 --> 02:12:05.817
EARLIER SO IT WOULD CERTAINLY

02:12:05.884 --> 02:12:07.452
BENEFIT OUR STUDENTS --

02:12:07.519 --> 02:12:08.553
AND ENCOURAGE THEIR EARLIER

02:12:08.620 --> 02:12:10.322
GRADUATION WHICH WOULD FREE UP

02:12:10.389 --> 02:12:12.524
SPACE IN THE FALL. FOR NEW FOR

02:12:12.591 --> 02:12:13.925
NEW UC STUDENTS BECAUSE OUR

02:12:13.992 --> 02:12:15.193

AND WE WILL BEGIN WITH CAROLINE

02:22:17.095 --> 02:22:19.931
FROM THE UC STUDENT ASSOCIATION.

02:22:19.998 --> 02:22:21.199
GOOD MORNING THANK YOU TO

02:22:21.266 --> 02:22:22.367
COMMITTEE LEADERSHIP FOR

02:22:22.433 --> 02:22:23.735
ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK TODAY ON

02:22:23.801 --> 02:22:25.470
THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CAL GRANT

02:22:25.536 --> 02:22:26.804
PROGRAM FOR YOU SEE STUDENTS.

02:22:26.871 --> 02:22:27.805
AND ALSO FOR MAKING SURE THAT

02:22:27.872 --> 02:22:29.073
STAND VOICE IS A PART OF TODAY'S

02:22:29.140 --> 02:22:30.308
HEARING AND THE POLICY MAKING

02:22:30.375 --> 02:22:31.776
PROCESS IT'S VERY MUCH

02:22:31.843 --> 02:22:33.411
APPRECIATED.

02:22:33.478 --> 02:22:35.113
AS THE CURRENT THIRD YEAR AT UC

02:22:35.179 --> 02:22:36.814
SAN DIEGO THE CAL GRANT IN

02:22:36.881 --> 02:22:38.283
COMBINATION WITH THE FEDERAL

02:22:38.349 --> 02:22:39.717
PELL GRANT AND A GENEROUS

02:22:39.784 --> 02:22:41.419
INSTITUTIONAL AID PROGRAM.

02:22:41.486 --> 02:22:42.854
HAS MEANT THAT I AM ABLE TO

02:22:42.921 --> 02:22:43.855
ATTEND THE UNIVERSITY OF

02:22:43.922 --> 02:22:45.657
CALIFORNIA WITHOUT HAVING TO

02:22:45.723 --> 02:22:46.758
WORRY ABOUT PAYING THE COST OF

02:22:46.824 --> 02:22:48.259
TUITION.

02:22:48.326 --> 02:22:50.628
ROUGHLY 56% OF OUR STUDENTS ARE

02:22:50.695 --> 02:22:52.196
IN THE SAME SITUATION.

02:22:52.263 --> 02:22:53.798
THE CAL GRANT HAS AFFORDED THE

02:22:53.865 --> 02:22:56.200
OPPORTUNITY TO STUDENTS AT ALL

02:22:56.267 --> 02:22:57.502
THREE INSTITUTIONS SINCE ITS

02:22:57.568 --> 02:23:00.638
INCEPTION IN NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE

02:23:00.705 --> 02:23:01.139
AS THE CALIFORNIA STATE

02:23:01.205 --> 02:23:02.040
SCHOLARSHIP.

02:23:02.106 --> 02:23:04.542
ESSENTIALLY SAYS THAT CALIFORNIA

02:23:04.609 --> 02:23:07.045
SEES THEM AND THEIR EDUCATION AS

02:23:07.111 --> 02:23:08.079
AN INVESTMENT.

02:23:08.146 --> 02:23:09.547
I THINK THE REFORM PROCESS

02:23:09.614 --> 02:23:11.482
ALLOWS US THE OPPORTUNITY TO

02:23:11.549 --> 02:23:13.952
EXPAND THIS PROMISE TO ADDRESS

02:23:14.018 --> 02:23:14.585
THE TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE AS

02:23:14.652 --> 02:23:16.187
WELL.

02:23:16.254 --> 02:23:18.089
TODAY I WOULD LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT

02:23:18.156 --> 02:23:19.557
THREE CONCERNS WITH THE CURRENT

02:23:19.624 --> 02:23:21.192
PROGRAM THAT I'M HOPING CAN BE

02:23:21.259 --> 02:23:23.428
ADDRESSED IN THE REFORM PROCESS.

02:23:23.494 --> 02:23:25.396
THE FIRST BEING BETTER SUPPORT

02:23:25.463 --> 02:23:27.565
FOR TRANSFER STUDENTS ONCE THEY

02:23:27.632 --> 02:23:29.133
ENTER OUR INSTITUTION.

02:23:29.200 --> 02:23:32.003
SECOND BEING A SUMMER CAL GRANT

02:23:32.070 --> 02:23:33.771
TO INCREASE TIME TO COMPLETION.

02:23:33.838 --> 02:23:35.340
AND THE THIRD BEING THE

02:23:35.406 --> 02:23:36.841
INCLUSION OF UNDOCUMENTED

02:23:36.908 --> 02:23:38.276
STUDENTS INTO OUR STATE AID

02:23:38.343 --> 02:23:40.445
PROGRAM.

02:23:40.511 --> 02:23:42.013
AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA

02:23:42.080 --> 02:23:43.681
THE GENEROUS ONE THIRD RETURN TO

02:23:43.748 --> 02:23:46.117
AID MODEL MEANS THAT STUDENTS

02:23:46.184 --> 02:23:47.719
WHO WOULD QUALIFY FOR CAL GRANT.

02:23:47.785 --> 02:23:49.354
BUT ARE EXCLUDED FOR A VARIETY

02:23:49.420 --> 02:23:51.255
OF REASONS SUCH AS BEING OVER

02:23:51.322 --> 02:23:52.991
THE AGE OF TWENTY EIGHT TAKING

02:23:53.057 --> 02:23:54.292
MORE THAN A YEAR OFF AFTER HIGH

02:23:54.359 --> 02:23:55.159
SCHOOL.

02:23:55.226 --> 02:23:56.160
AND US SOMETHING EVEN AS SIMPLE

02:23:56.227 --> 02:23:59.030
AS TURNING IN THEIR AFTER THE

02:23:59.097 --> 02:24:00.398
MARCH SECOND DEADLINE.

02:24:00.465 --> 02:24:02.900
MEANS THAT THEY ARE NOW NOT ABLE

02:24:02.967 --> 02:24:04.302
TO RECEIVE THE STATE CAL GRANT

02:24:04.369 --> 02:24:05.403
HOWEVER THE UNIVERSITY OF

02:24:05.470 --> 02:24:07.839
CALIFORNIA USES ROUGHLY TWO

02:24:07.905 --> 02:24:08.906
HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO MILLION

02:24:08.973 --> 02:24:11.342
DOLLARS OF OUR INSTITUTIONAL AID.

02:24:11.409 --> 02:24:13.011
TO BACK FILL THESE GENTS

02:24:13.077 --> 02:24:14.779
FINANCIAL AID --

02:24:14.846 --> 02:24:16.180
PACKAGES TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY

02:24:16.247 --> 02:24:18.416
ARE NOT GOING WITHOUT. TOO MANY

02:24:18.483 --> 02:24:19.984
TRANSFER STUDENTS ARE EXCLUDED

02:24:20.051 --> 02:24:21.519
FROM THE FINANCIAL SUPPORT

02:24:21.586 --> 02:24:22.653
PROVIDED IN THE CURRENT CAL

02:24:22.720 --> 02:24:24.455
GRANT PROGRAM AND I THINK THAT

02:24:24.522 --> 02:24:26.324
SENDS A MESSAGE THAT THE STATE

02:24:26.391 --> 02:24:27.692
OF CALIFORNIA DOES NOT SEE THOSE

02:24:27.759 --> 02:24:29.060
STRANDS AS WORTHY OF THE SAME

02:24:29.127 --> 02:24:30.395
INVESTMENT AND IT'S REALLY

02:24:30.461 --> 02:24:31.496
UNFORTUNATE I HOPE THAT CHANGES

02:24:31.562 --> 02:24:35.266
SOON. TO QUICKLY PUT NUMBERS TO

02:24:35.333 --> 02:24:38.503
THE ISSUE THERE ARE ROUGHLY

02:24:38.569 --> 02:24:39.103
TWENTY THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED

02:24:39.170 --> 02:24:40.104
STUDENTS AT UC.

02:24:40.171 --> 02:24:41.239
WHO WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR

02:24:41.305 --> 02:24:43.074
RECEIVING THE GRANT IF WE WERE

02:24:43.141 --> 02:24:44.275
TO FOLLOW THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT

02:24:44.342 --> 02:24:46.344
AID COMMISSION'S RECOMMENDATIONS

02:24:46.411 --> 02:24:47.745
APPROVED IN NOVEMBER?

02:24:47.812 --> 02:24:49.380
BY JUST ELIMINATING THE AGE

02:24:49.447 --> 02:24:51.049
REQUIREMENT OF TWENTY EIGHT WE

02:24:51.115 --> 02:24:52.216
COULD PROVIDE AID TO AN

02:24:52.283 --> 02:24:54.786
ADDITIONAL ONE THOUSAND NINE

02:24:54.852 --> 02:24:56.387
HUNDRED STUDENTS AT UC.

02:24:56.454 --> 02:24:58.322
THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF WHO IS

02:24:58.389 --> 02:25:00.258
PURSUING HIGHER EDUCATION IN THE

02:25:00.324 --> 02:25:02.026
STATE IS RAPIDLY CHANGING I KNOW

02:25:02.093 --> 02:25:03.361
THAT IN THE LAST FEW YEARS THE

02:25:03.428 --> 02:25:04.829
LEGISLATURE HAS PLACED AN

02:25:04.896 --> 02:25:07.065
EMPHASIS ON MAINTAINING A TWO TO

02:25:07.131 --> 02:25:08.266
ONE TRANSFER RATIO.

02:25:08.332 --> 02:25:09.567
AT THE UC.

02:25:09.634 --> 02:25:11.569
THIS MEANS IT NOW MORE THAN EVER

02:25:11.636 --> 02:25:13.037
THE INSTITUTION IS AND ROLLING

02:25:13.104 --> 02:25:14.972
AND NEEDING TO PROVIDE RESOURCES

02:25:15.039 --> 02:25:17.241
FOR THIS POPULATION. TO SUPPORT

02:25:17.308 --> 02:25:19.677
THEIR SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION.

02:25:19.744 --> 02:25:21.212
WE NEED TO EXPAND THE CURRENT

02:25:21.279 --> 02:25:23.214
PROGRAM BEYOND COVERING JUST THE

02:25:23.281 --> 02:25:26.184
COST OF TUITION AND LOOK AT

02:25:26.250 --> 02:25:26.751
COVERING THE TOTAL COST OF

02:25:26.818 --> 02:25:27.485
ATTENDANCE.

02:25:27.552 --> 02:25:28.653
POSSIBLY THROUGH AN INCREASE TO

02:25:28.719 --> 02:25:30.721
THE ACCESS AWARD.

02:25:30.788 --> 02:25:33.124
TODAY TUITION ONLY ACCOUNTS FOR

02:25:33.191 --> 02:25:34.692
ABOUT A THIRD OF STUDENTS COST

02:25:34.759 --> 02:25:36.494
OF ATTENDANCE IN THE UC.

02:25:36.561 --> 02:25:37.929
AND SOME OF THE LARGEST BARRIERS

02:25:37.995 --> 02:25:39.430
TO OUR STUDENTS TODAY ESPECIALLY

02:25:39.497 --> 02:25:41.032
LOW INCOME STUDENTS.

02:25:41.099 --> 02:25:41.833
ARE THE NON TUITION COSTS SUCH

02:25:41.899 --> 02:25:44.235
AS FOOD AND HOW.

02:25:44.302 --> 02:25:45.770
CONCERNING NUMBERS OF STUDENTS

02:25:45.837 --> 02:25:47.271
ON OUR CAMPUSES ARE STRUGGLING

02:25:47.338 --> 02:25:49.340
WITH HOMELESSNESS AND BASIC NEED

02:25:49.407 --> 02:25:51.342
SECURITY AND SECURITY.

02:25:51.409 --> 02:25:52.443
OUR STUDENTS SHOULD BE ABLE TO

02:25:52.510 --> 02:25:54.979
AFFORD BASIC NEEDS.

02:25:55.046 --> 02:25:58.282
LAST SUMMER I WAS ABLE.

02:25:58.349 --> 02:26:00.051
TO TAKE SUMMER COURSES AT UC SAN

02:26:00.118 --> 02:26:01.886
DIEGO AND SO THROUGH THE

02:26:01.953 --> 02:26:03.387
INSTITUTIONAL AID.

02:26:03.454 --> 02:26:04.922
I RECEIVED ROUGHLY TWO THOUSAND

02:26:04.989 --> 02:26:07.091
DOLLARS WITH THE FEDERAL PELL

02:26:07.158 --> 02:26:09.894
GRANT PROGRAM BEING A NEWLY

02:26:09.961 --> 02:26:11.596
APPROVED YEAR ROUND PROGRAM I

02:26:11.662 --> 02:26:13.531
RECEIVED ROUGHLY.

02:26:13.598 --> 02:26:14.132
NINE HUNDRED FROM THE FEDERAL

02:26:14.198 --> 02:26:15.066
GOVERNMENT.

02:26:15.133 --> 02:26:17.235
THAT COVERED TUITION.

02:26:17.301 --> 02:26:18.970
AND LEFT ME WITH.

02:26:19.036 --> 02:26:20.838
MAYBE TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR

02:26:20.905 --> 02:26:23.074
EVERY OTHER COST ASSOCIATED WITH

02:26:23.141 --> 02:26:25.643
ATTENDING SCHOOL THAT SUMMER.

02:26:25.710 --> 02:26:27.145
CURRENTLY STUDENTS CANNOT BE

02:26:27.211 --> 02:26:28.613
AWARDED CAL GRANT FOR THE SUMMER

02:26:28.679 --> 02:26:29.780
SESSIONS.

02:26:29.847 --> 02:26:30.815
BECAUSE A WOULD ESSENTIALLY

02:26:30.882 --> 02:26:33.251
REMOVE ONE OF THEIR ELIGIBILITY

02:26:33.317 --> 02:26:35.119
DURING THEIR SENIOR YEAR. FOR

02:26:35.186 --> 02:26:36.954
EXAMPLE IF YOU'RE A STUDENT AT

02:26:37.021 --> 02:26:39.891
UC BERKELEY AND YOU CHOSE TO USE

02:26:39.957 --> 02:26:41.425
YOUR CAL GRANT DURING THE SUMMER.

02:26:41.492 --> 02:26:43.961
YOUR SENIOR YEAR LAST SEMESTER

02:26:44.028 --> 02:26:44.462
YOU WOULD SUDDENLY BE AN

02:26:44.529 --> 02:26:45.863
ELIGIBLE.

02:26:45.930 --> 02:26:47.331
THAT PROVIDES AN ISSUE FOR A LOT

02:26:47.398 --> 02:26:48.599
OF OUR STUDENTS.

02:26:48.666 --> 02:26:50.201
TAKING SUMMER SESSIONS ENSURES

02:26:50.268 --> 02:26:52.069
THAT STUDENTS ARE LESS LIKELY TO

02:26:52.136 --> 02:26:53.237
DROP OUT OF SCHOOL AND GET THEIR

02:26:53.304 --> 02:26:55.006
DEGREE FASTER.

02:26:55.072 --> 02:26:55.907
HELLO GRANT RECIPIENTS AT THE

02:26:55.973 --> 02:26:57.441
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA HAVE A

02:26:57.508 --> 02:27:00.311
SIX YEAR GRADUATION RATE OF 72%.

02:27:00.378 --> 02:27:01.746
FOR THOSE WHO DO NOT ENROLL IN

02:27:01.812 --> 02:27:02.780
SUMMER.

02:27:02.847 --> 02:27:05.583
HOWEVER WHEN YOU TAKE OUT --

02:27:05.650 --> 02:27:06.150
OUT IN ONE ADDITIONAL SUMMER

02:27:06.217 --> 02:27:10.288
CHIU THAT GOES UP 286%.

02:27:10.354 --> 02:27:11.589
WHEN STUDENTS TAKE TWO SUMMER

02:27:11.656 --> 02:27:15.860
TERMS IT GOES UP 291%?

02:27:15.927 --> 02:27:17.628
YEAH BY PROVIDING A SUMMER CAL

02:27:17.695 --> 02:27:18.529
GRANT THIS WOULD FREE UP

02:27:18.596 --> 02:27:20.531
INSTITUTIONAL AID TO ALSO HELP

02:27:20.598 --> 02:27:21.999
COVER THE NON TUITION COSTS

02:27:22.066 --> 02:27:22.900
DURING THE SUMMER.

02:27:22.967 --> 02:27:24.835
ADDITIONALLY INCREASE INCREASING

02:27:24.902 --> 02:27:27.004
THE CAL GRANT BE ACCESS AWARD

02:27:27.071 --> 02:27:28.439
WOULD ALSO HELP WITH THESE NON

02:27:28.506 --> 02:27:31.309
TUITION COSTS.

02:27:31.375 --> 02:27:33.744
MY LAST POINT THAT I WOULD LIKE.

02:27:33.811 --> 02:27:35.413
TO SAY IS THAT THE CAL GRANT

02:27:35.479 --> 02:27:37.014
ALSO NEEDS TO BE EXPANDED TO

02:27:37.081 --> 02:27:38.449
ALLOW ELIGIBLE UNDOCUMENTED

02:27:38.516 --> 02:27:40.451
STUDENTS TO COMPETE FOR CAL

02:27:40.518 --> 02:27:41.986
GRANT AWARDS JUST AS THEIR PEERS

02:27:42.053 --> 02:27:42.753
DO.

02:27:42.820 --> 02:27:44.255
WITHOUT ADDITIONAL BARRIERS

02:27:44.322 --> 02:27:46.357
DESPITE THE ELIGIBILITY OF THE

02:27:46.424 --> 02:27:48.392
CALIFORNIA DREAM ACT FILERS FOR

02:27:48.459 --> 02:27:50.161
ENTITLEMENT CAL GRANTS CURRENT

02:27:50.228 --> 02:27:51.562
STATUTE REQUIRES THE ALL

02:27:51.629 --> 02:27:53.231
ELIGIBLE STUDENTS COMPLETING A

02:27:53.297 --> 02:27:54.298
FAFSA.

02:27:54.365 --> 02:27:55.967
MUST BE AWARDED THE COMPETITIVE

02:27:56.033 --> 02:27:57.902
CAL GRANT BEFORE THEIR PEERS

02:27:57.969 --> 02:27:59.537
THAT COMPLETE THE CALIFORNIA

02:27:59.604 --> 02:28:00.938
DREAM ACT.

02:28:01.005 --> 02:28:03.574
TO SO IN.

02:28:03.641 --> 02:28:04.542
TWENTY SEVENTEEN MORE THAN THREE

02:28:04.609 --> 02:28:05.643
HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THOUSAND

02:28:05.710 --> 02:28:06.911
CHANCE APPLIED.

FOR ROUGHLY TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND

02:28:08.746 --> 02:28:09.914
COMPETITIVE CAL GRANTS MEANING

02:28:09.981 --> 02:28:11.515
THAT FEWER THAN 7% OF THESE

02:28:11.582 --> 02:28:13.084
APPLICANTS RECEIVED MUCH NEEDED

02:28:13.150 --> 02:28:14.919
FINANCIAL AID.

02:28:14.986 --> 02:28:16.220
THIS IS ACTUALLY MEANS THAT

02:28:16.287 --> 02:28:17.855
CALIFORNIA DREAM ACT FILERS WILL

02:28:17.922 --> 02:28:19.223
NEVER RECEIVED THE COMPETITIVE

AND DEMONSTRATING.

02:28:24.295 --> 02:28:26.664
THE SAME ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE.

02:28:26.731 --> 02:28:28.165
I THANK YOU ALL FOR THE

AFFORDABLE AND CALIFORNIA.

02:29:09.073 --> 02:29:10.508
DESPITE THIS WORK THE REASON

02:29:10.574 --> 02:29:11.609
THAT WE ARE HERE TODAY IS

02:29:11.676 --> 02:29:12.877
BECAUSE THERE IS STILL A GREAT

02:29:12.943 --> 02:29:15.479
PROBLEM IMPACTING OUR STUDENTS.

02:29:15.546 --> 02:29:16.414
ONE THAT OUR STATE'S FINANCIAL

02:29:16.480 --> 02:29:18.115
AID SYSTEM STILL DOES NOT

02:29:18.182 --> 02:29:19.617
ADDRESS.

02:29:19.684 --> 02:29:20.951
LET ME START BY DESCRIBING THE

02:29:21.018 --> 02:29:23.621
PROBLEM AS CSU STUDENTS YET.

02:29:23.688 --> 02:29:25.623
LAST YEAR'S CS A SAVER RELEASED

02:29:25.690 --> 02:29:26.691
A REPORT WITH TI GUESS WHICH

02:29:26.757 --> 02:29:28.526
FOUND THAT ALTHOUGH CSU HAS ONE

02:29:28.592 --> 02:29:29.860
OF THE LOWEST TUITIONS IN THE

02:29:29.927 --> 02:29:30.728
COUNTRY.

02:29:30.795 --> 02:29:32.363
AND WERE NEARLY TWO THIRDS OF

02:29:32.430 --> 02:29:34.165
STUDENTS DO NOT PAY TUITION AT

02:29:34.231 --> 02:29:34.799
ALL.

02:29:34.865 --> 02:29:36.834
MANY ASSUME THAT THE CSU DEGREES

02:29:36.901 --> 02:29:37.902
AFFORDABLE.

02:29:37.968 --> 02:29:39.236
YET FINANCIALLY NEEDY STUDENTS%

02:29:39.303 --> 02:29:40.571
CONTINUE TO FACE VERY REAL

02:29:40.638 --> 02:29:42.239
CHALLENGES AFFORDING ALL OF THE

02:29:42.306 --> 02:29:43.841
COSTS NECESSARY TO EARN A

02:29:43.908 --> 02:29:45.743
COLLEGE DEGREE.

02:29:45.810 --> 02:29:46.811
THIS IS REFLECTED IN DEBT

02:29:46.877 --> 02:29:48.546
BURDENS THAT FALL MORE HEAVILY

02:29:48.612 --> 02:29:50.047
ON UNDER REPRESENTED STUDENTS

02:29:50.114 --> 02:29:51.582
AND EXCESSIVE WORK HOURS NEEDED

02:29:51.649 --> 02:29:52.683
TO COVER LOW INCOME STUDENTS NOT

02:29:52.750 --> 02:29:56.220
COSTS. FOR EXAMPLE EIGHT IN TEN

02:29:56.287 --> 02:29:57.855
STUDENTS WHO GRADUATE WITH THAT

02:29:57.922 --> 02:30:00.491
HAVE ANNUAL FAMILY INCOMES OF

02:30:00.558 --> 02:30:01.125
FIFTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS OR

02:30:01.192 --> 02:30:01.992
LESS.

02:30:02.059 --> 02:30:03.661
AND TWO THIRDS AND ANNUAL FAMILY

02:30:03.728 --> 02:30:05.529
INCOMES OF LESS THAN TWENTY

02:30:05.596 --> 02:30:07.031
SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS.

02:30:07.098 --> 02:30:08.666
WEEKLY WORK HOURS NEEDED RANGE

02:30:08.733 --> 02:30:10.534
FROM TWENTY TO FIFTY FIVE WITH A

02:30:10.601 --> 02:30:12.703
MEDIAN OF TWENTY NINE HOURS.

02:30:12.770 --> 02:30:13.938
THREE AND FOUR AFRICAN AMERICAN

02:30:14.004 --> 02:30:15.373
BACHELOR'S DEGREE RECIPIENTS

02:30:15.439 --> 02:30:18.376
GRADUATE WITH STUDENT LOAN DEBT.

02:30:18.442 --> 02:30:19.910
NEXT MOST OF YOU IN AS HEARING

02:30:19.977 --> 02:30:21.946
ARE AWARE OF THE BASIC NEEDS

02:30:22.012 --> 02:30:24.281
CHALLENGES FACING OUR STUDENTS.

02:30:24.348 --> 02:30:25.416
TEN POINT 9% OF CSU STUDENTS ARE

02:30:25.483 --> 02:30:27.151
HOMELESS.

02:30:27.218 --> 02:30:30.154
OVER 40% FACE SOME.

02:30:30.221 --> 02:30:32.289
TO SOME FORM OF FOOD INSECURITY.

02:30:32.356 --> 02:30:33.724
UNFORTUNATELY NO HIGHER

02:30:33.791 --> 02:30:35.693
EDUCATION SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA

02:30:35.760 --> 02:30:36.927
AVOID THESE ISSUES.

02:30:36.994 --> 02:30:38.329
LOW INCOME STUDENTS ACROSS ALL

02:30:38.396 --> 02:30:39.630
SEGMENTS STRUGGLE TO FEED

02:30:39.697 --> 02:30:40.898
THEMSELVES REGULARLY AND FALL

02:30:40.965 --> 02:30:42.967
INTO HOMELESSNESS.

02:30:43.033 --> 02:30:43.801
THIS IS A SIGN THAT OUR

02:30:43.868 --> 02:30:45.102
FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM IS NOT

02:30:45.169 --> 02:30:46.437
GIVING ENOUGH TO THE STUDENTS

02:30:46.504 --> 02:30:48.973
WHO NEED THE MOST SUPPORT.

02:30:49.039 --> 02:30:50.608
OF COURSE MUCH HAS BEEN DONE TO

02:30:50.674 --> 02:30:52.343
SUPPORT BASIC NEEDS CHALLENGES

02:30:52.410 --> 02:30:53.911
THAT STUDENTS FACE.

02:30:53.978 --> 02:30:55.079
CAMPUSES LEADERSHIP STUDENT

02:30:55.146 --> 02:30:57.581
LEADERSHIP AND STATE LEADERSHIP

02:30:57.648 --> 02:30:58.549
OF ALL STEPPED UP TO ADDRESS

02:30:58.616 --> 02:31:00.084
THESE ISSUES.

02:31:00.151 --> 02:31:00.918
BUT WE ALSO BE WORKING TOWARD

02:31:00.985 --> 02:31:02.353
THE TIME WHEN NONE OF THIS IS

02:31:02.420 --> 02:31:04.054
NECESSARY.

02:31:04.121 --> 02:31:05.089
WHEN THE STUDENTS STRUGGLE IS

02:31:05.156 --> 02:31:07.191
NOT HOW I FEED MYSELF TODAY BUT

02:31:07.258 --> 02:31:08.259
RATHER HOW I GET AN A ON MY MID

02:31:08.325 --> 02:31:11.061
TERM?

02:31:11.128 --> 02:31:12.062
THERE IS THE RESIDENCE HALL

02:31:12.129 --> 02:31:13.697
ADVISER ON MY CAMPUS AT

02:31:13.764 --> 02:31:15.166
SACRAMENTO STATE.

02:31:15.232 --> 02:31:16.500
SHE SOUGHT OUT THE ROLE AS AN RA

02:31:16.567 --> 02:31:17.568
BECAUSE SHE WANTED TO SUPPORT

02:31:17.635 --> 02:31:19.069
HER PEERS AND MAKE SURE THAT

02:31:19.136 --> 02:31:20.004
THEY HAD A WHOLE SOME COLLEGE

02:31:20.070 --> 02:31:22.306
EXPERIENCE ONE THAT SHE LONGED

02:31:22.373 --> 02:31:23.507
FOR AS WELL.

02:31:23.574 --> 02:31:25.109
AND AS AN R. A. HER HOUSING IS

02:31:25.176 --> 02:31:26.610
COVERED BY THE UNIVERSITY.

02:31:26.677 --> 02:31:27.578
YET SHE STILL HAS TO WORK THREE

02:31:27.645 --> 02:31:30.848
JOBS IS THIS DUTIES.

02:31:30.915 --> 02:31:33.250
THAT MEANS YES FOR TOTAL JOBS

02:31:33.317 --> 02:31:35.085
PLUS SCHOOL AND SHE'S BEING A

02:31:35.152 --> 02:31:37.021
ROLE MODEL TO HER PEERS.

02:31:37.087 --> 02:31:38.289
SHE'S A COMPLETELY FINANCIALLY

02:31:38.355 --> 02:31:39.857
INDEPENDENT WOMAN OF COLOR AND

02:31:39.924 --> 02:31:42.526
IS MAKING TREMENDOUS SACRIFICES.

02:31:42.593 --> 02:31:44.695
THIS STORY OF HERS MAKES ME ASK

02:31:44.762 --> 02:31:46.230
HOW CAN STUDENTS BE SUCCESSFUL

02:31:46.297 --> 02:31:48.299
IN THE CLASSROOM IF THEY CANNOT

02:31:48.365 --> 02:31:50.434
AFFORD THEIR COLLEGE EXPERIENCE.

02:31:50.501 --> 02:31:51.869
OF COURSE RESOURCES TO THE

02:31:51.936 --> 02:31:53.604
INSTITUTION ARE NECESSARY FOR

02:31:53.671 --> 02:31:55.406
STUDENTS TO BE SUCCESSFUL.

02:31:55.473 --> 02:31:57.908
AND FOR YEARS CSSA.

02:31:57.975 --> 02:31:58.642
HAS STOOD ALONGSIDE OR

02:31:58.709 --> 02:32:00.144
INSTITUTION AND MAKING THAT CASE

02:32:00.211 --> 02:32:01.412
TO YOU ALL.

02:32:01.479 --> 02:32:02.913
BUT WITHOUT INVESTMENT INTO

02:32:02.980 --> 02:32:04.415
FINANCIAL AID TO ADDRESS THESE

02:32:04.482 --> 02:32:06.917
ISSUES FOR ARE UNDER REPRESENTED

02:32:06.984 --> 02:32:08.752
AND LOW INCOME STUDENTS.

02:32:08.819 --> 02:32:09.520
THE INVESTMENT INTO THE

02:32:09.587 --> 02:32:10.855
INSTITUTION CAN NEVER BE FULLY

02:32:10.921 --> 02:32:13.324
REALIZED.

02:32:13.390 --> 02:32:15.125
HERE'S WHAT STUDENTS ALL ACROSS

02:32:15.192 --> 02:32:17.161
ALL SEGMENTS OUR LOOKING TO SEE

02:32:17.228 --> 02:32:18.329
ACHIEVED WE KNOW IT'S A BOLD

02:32:18.395 --> 02:32:18.996
GOAL.

02:32:19.063 --> 02:32:20.364
BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT OUR STATE

02:32:20.431 --> 02:32:21.732
LEADERS AND DON'T SHY AWAY FROM

02:32:21.799 --> 02:32:23.400
BOLD OPPORTUNITIES.

02:32:23.467 --> 02:32:24.902
SO FIRST IF A STUDENT HAS AN

02:32:24.969 --> 02:32:26.504
ECONOMIC NEED AND GETS ACCEPTED

02:32:26.570 --> 02:32:28.138
INTO COLLEGE IN CALIFORNIA WE

02:32:28.205 --> 02:32:29.173
NEED TO REDUCE AND REMOVE

02:32:29.240 --> 02:32:30.608
BARRIERS SO THAT THEY CAN

02:32:30.674 --> 02:32:32.243
RECEIVE STATE AID.

02:32:32.309 --> 02:32:33.644
SECOND AS THE TEARS HAVE

02:32:33.711 --> 02:32:35.412
MENTIONED WE NEED TO DO MORE TO

02:32:35.479 --> 02:32:36.447
COVER THE NON TUITION COSTS

02:32:36.514 --> 02:32:39.183
FACING OUR STUDENTS FOOD HOUSING

02:32:39.250 --> 02:32:40.818
BOOKS TRANSPORTATION.

02:32:40.885 --> 02:32:42.186
THIRD STUDENTS WHO WANT TO

02:32:42.253 --> 02:32:43.787
GRADUATE QUICKER BY ATTENDING

02:32:43.854 --> 02:32:45.489
SUMMER COURSES SHOULD ACCESS TO

02:32:45.556 --> 02:32:46.690
STATE AID TO MAKE THAT A

02:32:46.757 --> 02:32:48.092
REALISTIC POSSIBILITY FOR LOW

02:32:48.158 --> 02:32:50.261
INCOME STUDENTS.

02:32:50.327 --> 02:32:52.129
FOURTH WHILE WE WORK TO FIX

02:32:52.196 --> 02:32:54.064
FINANCIAL AID BASIC ME THE

02:32:54.131 --> 02:32:55.266
NATIONAL NEED TO BE FUNDED AS

02:32:55.332 --> 02:32:58.502
SOON AS POSSIBLE.

02:32:58.569 --> 02:33:00.504
I WOULD LIKE TO AND MY COMMENTS

02:33:00.571 --> 02:33:02.039
WITH IT A SHORT ANECDOTE.

02:33:02.106 --> 02:33:03.908
WHEN STUDENT LEADERS SOME

02:33:03.974 --> 02:33:04.775
STANDING SITTING WITH ME TODAY

02:33:04.842 --> 02:33:06.310
FROM CALIFORNIA JOINS OTHER

02:33:06.377 --> 02:33:07.578
STUDENT LEADERS FROM NEW YORK

WASHINGTON DC WE TALKED WITH

02:33:11.315 --> 02:33:12.516
THAT WE TALKED ABOUT FINANCIAL

02:33:12.583 --> 02:33:14.485
AID IN AFFORDABILITY CHALLENGES

02:33:14.552 --> 02:33:15.219
IN OUR STATE AND ACROSS OUR

02:33:15.286 --> 02:33:16.320
NATION.

02:33:16.387 --> 02:33:17.955
AND AND ONE OF THEM OUR MEETINGS

02:33:18.022 --> 02:33:19.890
A CONGRESSMAN ASKED WHY IS THIS

02:33:19.957 --> 02:33:20.824
HAPPENING WISE IT'S

02:33:20.891 --> 02:33:22.893
AFFORDABILITY CRISIS HAPPENING

02:33:22.960 --> 02:33:24.828
IN CALIFORNIA.

02:33:24.895 --> 02:33:25.596
AND AT THE TIME IT WAS HARD TO

02:33:25.663 --> 02:33:26.864
GIVE HIM AN ANSWER WHY.

02:33:26.931 --> 02:33:27.998
BUT I THINK I CAN ANSWER THAT

02:33:28.065 --> 02:33:29.066
TODAY.

02:33:29.133 --> 02:33:30.100
IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE DONE THE

02:33:30.167 --> 02:33:31.535
NECESSARY JOB OF GETTING MORE

02:33:31.602 --> 02:33:34.038

ADDITIONALLY TODAY AND HAS NEVER

02:33:38.042 --> 02:33:39.810
BEEN MORE EXPENSIVE TO LIVE IN

02:33:39.877 --> 02:33:40.411
OUR STATE.

02:33:40.477 --> 02:33:42.513
AND LASTLY THE PALO WORD HAS

02:33:42.580 --> 02:33:43.080
NEVER HAD A LOWER PURCHASING

02:33:43.147 --> 02:33:44.481
POWER.

02:33:44.548 --> 02:33:45.749
THIS MEANS THAT WHILE THE STATE

02:33:45.816 --> 02:33:47.051
STILL DOES A GREAT JOB ON

02:33:47.117 --> 02:33:49.119
TUITION STUDENTS ARE DROWNING IN

02:33:49.186 --> 02:33:51.221
NON TUITION COSTS WITH VERY FEW

02:33:51.288 --> 02:33:53.257

FEDERAL LEVEL ON PAL BUT WE KNOW

TO LEAVE WITH US.

02:43:11.815 --> 02:43:13.817
YOU KNOW I I THINK WHAT ALL THE

STUDENTS HAVE MENTIONED WOULD BE

02:43:14.985 --> 02:43:17.587
HELPFUL SOLUTIONS I I THINK THAT --

02:43:17.654 --> 02:43:19.089
IN PREVIOUS PANELS THAT WE SAW

02:43:19.156 --> 02:43:21.424
TODAY ON LOOKING AT OKAY WELL IF

I THINK THAT'S WHAT LED US TO

02:43:29.166 --> 02:43:31.368
THIS PROBLEM AS THAT WE'VE YOU

02:43:31.434 --> 02:43:33.303
KNOW SEEN SOLUTIONS COME IN BITS

02:43:33.370 --> 02:43:34.604
AND PIECES.

02:43:34.671 --> 02:43:35.438
AND I THINK REALLY WHAT OUR

02:43:35.505 --> 02:43:37.374
STUDENTS NEED TODAY IS A PACKAGE

02:43:37.440 --> 02:43:38.909
THE NEED TO SEE A PLAN.

02:43:38.975 --> 02:43:39.776
THEY NEED TO SEE YOU KNOW IF

02:43:39.843 --> 02:43:41.545
IT'S TODAY IF IT'S LONG TERM

02:43:41.611 --> 02:43:43.146
WHATEVER IT IS I THINK SEEING A

02:43:43.213 --> 02:43:45.315
PLAN OF HOW THESE SOLUTIONS CAN

02:43:45.382 --> 02:43:48.084
BE CREATED OVER TIME.

02:43:48.151 --> 02:43:49.519
THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY THE

02:43:49.586 --> 02:43:50.887
PIGEON HOME --

02:43:50.954 --> 02:43:54.591
ANY BUDGETS OR ARE PUT OTHERS --

02:43:54.658 --> 02:43:55.192
AND UNCOMFORTABLE POSITIONS BY

02:43:55.258 --> 02:43:58.461
MAKING GIVING US TIME TO CREATE

02:43:58.528 --> 02:44:00.463
A PLAN AND I THINK THAT'S

02:44:00.530 --> 02:44:02.199
EXTREMELY NECESSARY NOT SAYING

02:44:02.265 --> 02:44:03.600
OKAY WILL WANT WHAT IS THE ONLY

02:44:03.667 --> 02:44:04.935
OR ONE THING THAT COULD BE

02:44:05.001 --> 02:44:05.902
FEASIBLE.

02:44:05.969 --> 02:44:07.370
I THINK ALL OF THESE SOLUTIONS

02:44:07.437 --> 02:44:08.805
THAT WE'RE PROVIDING.

02:44:08.872 --> 02:44:10.440
CAN BE FEASIBLE AND WE CAN BE

02:44:10.507 --> 02:44:11.541
CREATIVE AROUND THAT AND I THINK

02:44:11.608 --> 02:44:12.609
ALL OF US STUDENTS ARE REALLY

02:44:12.676 --> 02:44:13.743
INTERESTED IN BEING A PART OF

02:44:13.810 --> 02:44:15.011

PLAN AND WE CAN PHASE IN CERTAIN

02:44:26.022 --> 02:44:28.124
ELEMENTS WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT

02:44:28.191 --> 02:44:29.626
IS IT TO HELP YOU IN YOUR

02:44:29.693 --> 02:44:31.361
COLLEAGUES.

02:44:47.477 --> 02:44:49.512
SHOULD START.

02:44:49.579 --> 02:44:50.580
I THINK THAT SAID THAT'S A TOUGH

02:44:50.647 --> 02:44:51.748
QUESTION TO ANSWER AND THAT'S

02:44:51.815 --> 02:44:53.416
WHY I WAS YOU KNOW KIND OF

02:44:53.483 --> 02:44:54.818
THINKING ONE OTHER PANELISTS

02:44:54.884 --> 02:44:56.553
WOULD ANSWER THAT QUESTION.

02:44:56.620 --> 02:44:57.687

DESCRIBED IN ALSO WHEN THOSE

02:45:04.995 --> 02:45:07.030
SOLUTIONS CAN BE MADE --

02:45:07.097 --> 02:45:09.032
I KNOW THAT SOME MIGHT BE EASIER

02:45:09.099 --> 02:45:10.667
TO MAKE SOME MIGHT BE QUICKER

02:45:10.734 --> 02:45:12.335
FIXES THAN OTHERS IF IT'S YOU

NOW AND WORKING ON A MORE LONG

02:45:17.474 --> 02:45:19.109
TERM STRATEGY MOVING FORWARD I

02:45:19.175 --> 02:45:20.343
KNOW THE CSU.

02:45:20.410 --> 02:45:22.479
ONLY HAS A ONE TIME --

02:45:22.545 --> 02:45:23.813
FUNDING REQUEST FOR BASIC NEEDS

02:45:23.880 --> 02:45:24.881
LOOKING OUT WHAT THAT COULD LOOK

02:45:24.948 --> 02:45:26.483
LIKE LONG TERM WILL HELP IN

02:45:26.549 --> 02:45:28.018
DIFFERENT WAYS AND YOU KNOW WHEN

02:45:28.084 --> 02:45:29.286
THERE'S DIFFERENT ISSUES OF

02:45:29.352 --> 02:45:31.421
ACCESS AND THEN ALSO THE BASIC

02:45:31.488 --> 02:45:32.022
NEEDS.

02:45:32.088 --> 02:45:33.523
COMPONENT --

02:45:33.590 --> 02:45:35.225
AND GRADUATING WITH THAT THOSE

02:45:35.292 --> 02:45:36.760
ARE THREE ISSUES THAT ARE KIND

02:45:36.826 --> 02:45:38.762
OF MOVING IN DIFFERENT AREAS AND

02:45:38.828 --> 02:45:40.463
HAVE DIFFERENT --

02:45:40.530 --> 02:45:42.265
IMPACTS OF WHAT'S CAUSING THEM.

02:45:42.332 --> 02:45:43.833
SO -- I

02:45:43.900 --> 02:45:44.734
WOULD SAY.

02:45:44.801 --> 02:45:46.736
WE SHOULD LOOK AT PRIORITIES AND

02:45:46.803 --> 02:45:48.438
I THINK ALL FOR OF BEES --

02:45:48.505 --> 02:45:49.306
ITEMS THAT OUR STUDENTS ARE

02:45:49.372 --> 02:45:50.774
BRINGING FORWARD SHOULD BE

02:45:50.840 --> 02:45:52.075
PRIORITIES --

02:45:52.142 --> 02:45:53.243

THE END FOR SOME REASON AND HE

02:46:07.857 --> 02:46:08.391
SAID.

02:46:08.458 --> 02:46:09.292

BACK TO COLLEGE I HAD ALREADY

03:07:28.070 --> 03:07:29.338

REPRESENTING THIRTY ONE THOUSAND

03:12:40.515 --> 03:12:41.283
STUDENTS.

03:12:41.349 --> 03:12:42.684

IN THE SENSE OF URGENCY.

03:12:47.088 --> 03:12:48.623
I THINK WHEN YOU SEE A STUDENT

03:12:48.690 --> 03:12:49.925
WILLINGLY SHARE WITH YOU THAT

03:12:49.991 --> 03:12:51.092

03:12:53.862 --> 03:12:54.596
FIRSTHAND.

03:12:54.663 --> 03:12:56.464
IT REALLY CHANGES THE SENSE OF

03:12:56.531 --> 03:12:57.799
URGENCY THAT YOU HAVE TO REFER

03:12:57.866 --> 03:12:58.934

03:13:00.335 --> 03:13:01.369
AID REFORM.

03:13:01.436 --> 03:13:03.138
THAT'S WHY I THINK OUR STUDENTS

03:13:03.204 --> 03:13:04.406
STORIES AND BRINGING THEM TO THE

03:13:04.472 --> 03:13:07.142
SPACES ARE CRITICAL TO REALLY

03:13:07.208 --> 03:13:08.443
UNDERSTANDING WHAT'S BEHIND

03:13:08.510 --> 03:13:09.611

03:13:11.513 --> 03:13:12.247
SECURITY.

03:13:12.314 --> 03:13:14.049
AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT IS NOT

03:13:14.115 --> 03:13:14.983
CONDUCIVE TO LEARNING

03:13:15.050 --> 03:13:16.551

HELPING OTHER STUDENTS OUT.

03:13:19.821 --> 03:13:20.588
BUT I THINK AT THE END OF THE

03:13:20.655 --> 03:13:23.024
DAY IT IS SOMETHING WHERE THE OF

03:13:23.091 --> 03:13:24.025
REFORM AND THAT'S WHY I'M

HAVE MY TUITION FULLY COVERED BY

03:17:05.113 --> 03:17:06.681
FINANCIAL AID BUT UNFORTUNATELY

03:17:06.748 --> 03:17:08.016
IT FAILS TO COVER EXPENSES SUCH

03:17:08.082 --> 03:17:09.050
AS HOUSING --

03:17:09.117 --> 03:17:11.352
BOOKS AND OTHER OTHER THINGS AS

03:17:11.419 --> 03:17:12.921
A FIRST GENERATION LOW INCOME

03:17:12.987 --> 03:17:14.455
STUDENTS I RECEIVED VERY LITTLE

03:17:14.522 --> 03:17:15.690
TO ALMOST NO HELP FROM MY

03:17:15.757 --> 03:17:17.258
PARENTS AND THEREFORE FORCED TO

UNIVERSITY WOULD BE NEARLY

03:17:22.197 --> 03:17:24.065
IMPOSSIBLE --

03:17:24.132 --> 03:17:25.033
I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THESE

QUARTER I HAVE SO MANY EXPENSES

03:17:32.140 --> 03:17:33.708
THAT EVEN WITH LOANS IT WAS

03:17:33.775 --> 03:17:35.276
OVERWHELMING BECAUSE THE COST OF

03:17:35.343 --> 03:17:37.145
MY REQUIRE BOOKS WERE A LOT

03:17:37.212 --> 03:17:38.213
HIGHER THAN THE THAN THEY HAD

03:17:38.279 --> 03:17:39.347
BEEN IN THE PAST.

03:17:39.414 --> 03:17:41.082
SO I CHOSE NOT TO BUY ONE OF THE

03:17:41.149 --> 03:17:42.650

03:32:42.416 --> 03:32:43.750
HOUSING MARKETS IN THE WORLD

03:32:43.817 --> 03:32:45.085
LIVING IN SANTA CRUZ ARE RENTS

03:32:45.152 --> 03:32:46.920
ARE RIDICULOUS AND MYSELF AND

03:32:46.987 --> 03:32:49.223
MOST OF MY PEERS HAVE BEEN SOME

03:32:49.289 --> 03:32:50.591

03:33:09.476 --> 03:33:10.744
UNREALISTIC TO EXPECT THAT

03:33:10.811 --> 03:33:11.979
FINANCIALLY THE WAY THAT IT IS

03:33:12.045 --> 03:33:13.714
SET UP RIGHT NOW IS JUST NOT

03:33:13.780 --> 03:33:15.682

UNIVERSITY AFFAIRS COMMITTEE --

03:34:10.571 --> 03:34:12.039
THE ONLY REASON I AM HERE TODAY

03:34:12.105 --> 03:34:13.707
IS BECAUSE OF THE FINANCIAL AID

03:34:13.774 --> 03:34:15.475
THAT I RECEIVE --

03:34:15.542 --> 03:34:17.177
IT IN FACT AS A FOURTH YEAR I AM

03:34:17.244 --> 03:34:18.212
ACTUALLY HAVING TROUBLE GETTING

03:34:18.278 --> 03:34:19.246
THE CLASSES THAT I NEED TO

03:34:19.313 --> 03:34:20.514

03:34:20.581 --> 03:34:21.915

03:34:21.982 --> 03:34:23.350
OF MY FRIENDS HAVE NOT HAD THE

03:34:23.417 --> 03:34:24.785
SAME FATE AND MANY OF THEM ARE

03:34:24.851 --> 03:34:26.386

03:34:26.453 --> 03:34:27.888
THANKFULLY I WAS ABLE TO ACCESS

03:34:27.955 --> 03:34:29.323
SOME RECESSION AND IT LOOKS LIKE

03:34:29.389 --> 03:34:30.490
THAT I'M GRADUATING IN THE

03:34:30.557 --> 03:34:31.825
SPRING --

03:34:31.892 --> 03:34:33.193
ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE NEED

03:34:33.260 --> 03:34:34.428
TO EXPAND CAL GRANTS THE SUMMER

03:34:34.494 --> 03:34:35.529
IS BECAUSE THIS ISSUE INTERSECTS

03:34:35.596 --> 03:34:36.997
WITH SO MANY OF THE OTHER

03:34:37.064 --> 03:34:39.833
PROBLEMS THAT WE SEE --

03:34:39.900 --> 03:34:41.168
I HAVEN'T ESPECIALLY AS IN ROMAN

03:34:41.235 --> 03:34:42.436
INCREASES AT THE UC AND OF

03:34:42.502 --> 03:34:44.137
STUDENTS ARE HAVING TO STAY

03:34:44.204 --> 03:34:45.606
LONGER AYE SENIORS AS MORE

03:34:45.672 --> 03:34:46.740
COMING IN AS FRESHMEN WE'RE

03:34:46.807 --> 03:34:48.609
GONNA CONTINUE TO SEE WORSENING

03:34:48.675 --> 03:34:50.744
HOUSING AND SECURITY --

03:34:50.811 --> 03:34:52.879
LARGER CLASSES THE SMALLEST ONE

03:34:52.946 --> 03:34:53.914
THAT I'VE BEEN IN UP UNTIL THIS

03:34:53.981 --> 03:34:55.282
QUARTER WAS A HUNDRED AND TWENTY

03:34:55.349 --> 03:34:56.883
PEOPLE -- SO

03:34:56.950 --> 03:34:58.118
I DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO MY

03:34:58.185 --> 03:35:01.722
PROFESSOR IS --

03:35:01.788 --> 03:35:02.256
AND WE'RE GOING TO SEE IT

03:35:02.322 --> 03:35:06.693
CONTINUED Là SEE WHAT IT MIGHT

03:35:06.760 --> 03:35:07.561
OR TO TO PASS THANK YOU.

03:35:07.628 --> 03:35:10.330
THANK YOU.

03:35:10.397 --> 03:35:12.232
UGH AFTER LETTERS LETTERS MY

03:35:12.299 --> 03:35:14.201
NAME IS COMING OFF AND WENT TO

03:35:14.268 --> 03:35:16.036
COURT ON THE CHAIR OF THE COLOR

03:35:16.103 --> 03:35:16.870
FOR BETTY SEE.

03:35:16.937 --> 03:35:17.704
NOW I'VE SORT OF POINT OUT WHAT

03:35:17.771 --> 03:35:18.805
I HOPE IS A TYPO IN THIS AGENDA

03:35:18.872 --> 03:35:20.807
DOCUMENT ON PAGE NINE SECOND

03:35:20.874 --> 03:35:21.575
PARAGRAPH --

03:35:21.642 --> 03:35:23.143
BOLD SAYS DESPITE STATE AND

03:35:23.210 --> 03:35:24.544
SEGMENT FOCUS ON QUICK ATTACH A

03:35:24.611 --> 03:35:27.047
DEGREE STATE AID DOES ADEQUATELY

03:35:27.114 --> 03:35:27.914
COVER SOME SCHOOL COSTS.

03:35:27.981 --> 03:35:28.849
OTHER IS NOT A PROBLEM WITH THIS

03:35:28.915 --> 03:35:30.417
IS BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT IN THE

03:35:30.484 --> 03:35:31.952
UC SINCE ONLY RECEIVED PELL

03:35:32.019 --> 03:35:32.853
GRANTS FROM THE FEDERAL

03:35:32.919 --> 03:35:34.421
GOVERNMENT AND INSTITUTIONAL

03:35:34.488 --> 03:35:35.322
GRANTS FROM FROM THE INSTITUTION

03:35:35.389 --> 03:35:36.723
AND THE ONLY THEY CAN ACCESS THE

03:35:36.790 --> 03:35:37.924
STATE AID IS THAT THEY DON'T USE

03:35:37.991 --> 03:35:38.859
IT DURING THE REGULAR ACADEMIC --

03:35:38.925 --> 03:35:39.993
SO THIS DOESN'T MAKE SENSE AND

03:35:40.060 --> 03:35:41.528
IN ADDITION TO THAT WE KNOW THAT

03:35:41.595 --> 03:35:43.030
WHEN STUDENTS DO GET THOSE TO

03:35:43.096 --> 03:35:44.197
GRANT IT'S STILL NOT ENOUGH TO

03:35:44.264 --> 03:35:45.899
COVER TUITION AND CAMPUS BASED
