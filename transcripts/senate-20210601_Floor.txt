FORTY SEVEN ADDRESSES THE SERIOUS PROBLEM OF DESERTED WALLS IN CALIFORNIA HE HAS BEEN ESTIMATED THAT CALIFORNIA HAS AN ESTIMATED LIABILITY OF AT LEAST FIVE HUNDRED AND TWENTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IT COULD BE UP TO FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. DESERTED WALLS ARE A FINANCIAL LIABILITY TO THE STATE AND DANGEROUS TO THE SURROUNDING ENVIRONMENT RESIDENTS. THE WELLS CAN LEAK DEGRADING AIR QUALITY AND CONTAMINATING AQUIFERS HARMING THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY THIS BILL INCREASES THE ANNUAL AMOUNT CALVIN CAN SPEND AND ALSO ALLOWS CAL JAM TO POTENTIALLY SAVE WE ARE WORKING WITH OPPOSITION AND WE HAVE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS. AT THE END OF THE- TO ENSURE A BALANCED SOLUTION CAN BE REACHED WITH US THAT WILL BE PROTECTED TAXPAYERS HI IT'S LIKELY ASPIRIN I'VE OF. IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. SENATOR STERN. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I JUST HAVE TO SAY I APPRECIATE. THE CENTER FROM- THE CENTRAL COAST EFFORTS ON THIS AND- OUR EFFORTS TO REACH A COMPROMISE OVER I JUST I THINK IT'S WORTH MANAGING EXPECTATIONS ABOUT THE SCOPE OF WHAT THIS BILL WILL AND WON'T DO ALL I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE MEASURE TODAY BUT WE'VE GOT A BILLION DOLLAR TAXPAYER LIABILITY ON OUR HANDS MEMBERS WHEN IT COMES TO ORPHAN AND- IDLE THEN ABANDON WELLS IN THIS STATE- THIS BILL WILL NOT SOLVE THAT PROBLEM WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO STEP UP AND PUSH ALL OF OURSELVES AND OUR RESPECTIVE JURISDICTIONS TO GET THE CAPITAL TOGETHER. BOTH FROM THE OIL INDUSTRY AND FROM THE PUBLIC SIDE TO GET HIS WORK DONE I APPRECIATE THE SENATOR'S HARD WORK I JUST THINK IT'S IMPORTANT GOING INTO THIS VOTE TO NOT ASSUME THAT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IS GOING TO SOLVE A BILLION DOLLAR PROBLEM SO INCREMENTAL STEP FOUR I'LL BE SUPPORTING TODAY BUT WANT TO SEE S. DO MUCH MORE FOR ALL THE PEOPLE LEFT BEHIND IN THEIR FRONTLINE COMMUNITIES. ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. CENTER GROVE. PRESIDENT I TOO HAVE HAD LENGTHY CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHOR HAND- MY COLLEAGUE FRIEND IN THE VENTURE AREA. I AM. I DON'T THINK THIS IS A SOLUTION TO THE ISSUE THAT WE HAVE WITH YOUR FRIEND AND ABANDONED WELLS OBVIOUSLY ALL OF US IN THIS IN THIS BUILDING. AND HAVE A CONCERN WITH THE LIABILITY EXPOSURE WITH YOUR FRIEND OF ANNA WELLS AND THE MINIMAL DOLLARS IN THE FUND TO BE ABLE TO- TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM- I APPLAUD MY COLLEAGUES. ALTHOUGH I CAN'T SUPPORT THE BILL I DO APPLAUD MY COLLEAGUES- INCREMENTAL TINY ITTY BITTY STEPS TO TRY TO ADDRESS THIS TO ALLOW CALCIUM TO SPEND ADDITIONAL DOLLARS IS GOOD SO THEY DON'T SWEET MONEY OUT OF THE ACCOUNT BECAUSE CALCIUM. OBVIOUSLYCAN'T BUDGET FOR SOMETHING THAT'S A TEN MILLION DOLLAR PROJECT AND THEY ONLY HAVE TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN THE FUND. SO I UNDERSTAND WHERE THE AUTHOR IS TRYING TO GO I DID HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHOR ABOUT HOW TO REALLY SOLVE THIS PROBLEM AND AS SOMEBODY WHO REPRESENT 70% OF THE STATE OIL STATES OIL. LARGE AND SMALL PRODUCERS ARE IN MY DISTRICT I HAVE ONE PRODUCER THAT PRODUCES ABOUT A HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT THOUSAND BARRELS A DAY AND I HAVE A PRODUCER WHO PRODUCES TWO BARRELS A DAY. AND I THINK THAT THERE IS A REAL SOLUTION ON ON- SOLVING THIS WITH A- IN MAYBE A COST PER BARREL SO THAT IS EQUITABLY DISTRIBUTED BETWEEN LARGE PRODUCERS AND SMALL PRODUCERS I DON'T THINK THIS IS A SOLUTION BUT I HAVE COMMITTED. TO WORK WITH HER MOVING FORWARD TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. SINGMAN CENTER YOUR MIND YOU MAY CONCLUDE THANK YOU AND IT IS AND MY COLLEAGUES HAVE EXPRESSED THIS IS ONE REALLY SMALL PIECES TO A LARGER PROBLEM AND I THINK IT'S GOING TO TAKE MORE THAN THIS BILL- TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND HOW CALIFORNIA GETS TO ANYWHERE FROM FIVE HUNDRED MILLION TO FIVE BILLION- IN TERMS OF THE WORK THAT'S NEEDED. I DO WANT TO CALL OUT TO THAT IN THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISE I HE PROPOSED USING TWO HUNDRED MILLION OF GENERAL FUND DOLLARS TAXPAYERS DOLLARS TO TRY TO GET AT THIS AND WE ARE TRYING TO FIND AN ALTERNATIVE AND ANOTHER WAY. TO HELP TACKLE THIS PROBLEM BUT I ABSOLUTELY AGREE THAT THIS BILL ALONE DOES NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM IN FRONT OF US WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND I VOTE. PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS DIE I RISE TO PRESENT SENATE BILL TWO FORTY TWO AND URGENCY MEASURE WHICH DIRECTION SHARERS TO REIMBURSE HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS FOR NECESSARY PP DURING AN EMERGENCY PUB PUBLIC HEALTH OR OR UNTIL SUCH TIME AS CONTRACTS ARE RENEGOTIATED. SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZED PHYSICIAN PRACTICES ALL ACROSS CALIFORNIA HAVE BEEN DECIMATED BY THE PANDEMIC AND THE DRAMATICALLY HIGH COST OF SUPPLIES NEEDED TO KEEP PATIENTS SAFE EVEN WITH RECENT REDUCTIONS IN COVERT CASES AND HIGHER VACCINATION RATES. LAST YEAR THESE PRACTICES WERE DEALING WITH ON AVERAGE WITH A AUGUST AND THEY ARE STILL EXPERIENCE ABOUT A 30% DECLINE IN REVENUE OVERALL MUCH OF THIS DECLINE. HAS BEEN A DIRECT DIRECT RESULT OF A COMBINATION DECREASED PATIENT VOLUME COMPOUNDED BY STEEP INCREASES IN THE COST OF PP AND OTHER PROTOCOLS OVER THE PAST VERY CHALLENGING YEAR MANY PHYSICIAN OWNED PRACTICES IN CALIFORNIA HAVE HAD TO REDUCE STAFF OR EVEN CLOSE THEIR DOORS ALL TOGETHER EVEN AS HEALTH INSURANCE EXPERIENCE. HEALTH INSURERS HAVE ENJOYED RECORD PROFITS IN FACT DOUBLE THE PROFITS IN SOME CASES FROM THE PREVIOUS YEAR I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT DURING A PANDEMIC THE IMPERATIVE FOR INCREASED PP AND MORE COMPLEX INFECTION CONTROL PROTOCOLS SHOULD NOT RESULT IN DECREASED ACCESS. THE CLOSURE OF CRITICALLY NEEDED CARE FACILITIES OR REDUCTIONS IN MEDICAL SERVICES AMENITIES TAKEN FOR THIS BILLING COMMITTEE ADDRESS THE HEALTH PLANS CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL BEING OVERLY BROAD AS WELL AS NARROWING ITS FOCUS SO THAT ITS PROVISIONS WILL ONLY BE APPLICABLE ONLY STATEWIDE EMERGENCY PUBLIC HEALTH ORDER IS IN EFFECT.

TWO FORTY FIVE WHICH WILL REQUIRE ALL STATE LICENSED HEALTH CARE PLANS ISSUED AFTER TWENTY TWENTY TWO TO COVER ABORTION. AND ABORTION RELATED SERVICES WITHOUT A COPAYMENT DEDUCTIBLE OR ANY TYPE OF COST SHARING CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN A LEADER IN PROTECTING AN INDIVIDUAL'S RIGHT TO ACCESS REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND ALL THESE EFFORTS HAVE HELPED MAINTAIN THE RIGHT FOR DECADES THERE ALSO THERE ARE STILL NUMEROUS BARRIERS TO ACCESSING THESE SERVICES. INCLUDING AFFORDABILITY THESE HIGH OUT OF POCKET COSTS ARE SIGNIFICANT BARRIER TO CARE THAT CAN BE COST PROHIBITIVE TO LOW INCOME WORKING FAMILIES AS B. TWO FORTY FIVE WILL REMOVE THIS BARRIER AND ALLOW ALL CALIFORNIANS TO ACCESS THEIR LEGAL RIGHT TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE SERVICES BY ENSURING THAT HEALTH PLANS CAN'T REQUIRE COST SHARING FOR ABORTION OR ABORTION RELATED SERVICES. I THINK- IF B. TWO FORTY FIVE WILL ENSURE THAT WE REMAIN THE LEADER IN THIS FIGHT AND MUST CONTINUE TO WIN WE MUST CONTINUE AS A STATE TO DEFENDANT AND EXPAND ACCESS TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE IN ALL FORMS.

CENTERMAN HE IS PREPARED PLEASE READ SENATE BILL TWO SIXTY FOUR BY SENATOR MAN AN ACT RELATING TO FIREARMS CENTER MAN THE FLOOR IS YOURS THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS TODAY I RISE TO PRODUCE PRESENT TO U. S. B. TWO SIXTY FOUR WELL TO ENSURE THAT THIS STATE IS NOT PROFITING FROM THE SALE OF FIREARMS AMMUNITION AND FIREARM PRECURSOR PARTS ON STATE PROPERTY OR FACILITATING GUN SHOWS ON STATEPROPERTY THAT COULD UNDERMINE CALIFORNIA'S STRONG. FIREARM REGULATIONS. LAST YEAR YOU MAY REMEMBER THE WEEK WEEKEND WHEN WE HAD THE EL PASO SHOOTINGS I GUESS AS A TWO YEAR AND A HALF AGO. IN MY HOUSEHOLD I REMEMBERED THATWE HAD TO EXPLAIN TO OUR CHILDREN ARE YOUNG CHILDREN YET AGAIN. ABOUT ANOTHER GUN MASSACRE AND TALK TO THEM ABOUT THE DANGERS OF GUN VIOLENCE IN AMERICA. THE VERY NEXT MORNING WE WOKE UP TO LEARN THERE BEEN ANOTHER MASS SHOOTING IN DAYTON OHIO. THIS IS PERSONAL FOR US. BECAUSE MY WIFE HAS FAMILY IN DAYTON AND A NUMBER OF COUSINS WHO ATTENDED THE UNIVERSITY OF DAYTON. AND FREQUENT THE BAR WHERE THAT SHOOTING HAD TAKEN PLACE. WE HAD TO MAKE THOSE ANXIOUS PHONE CALLS TO FAMILY TO MAKE SURE THEY WERE ALL OKAY. AND FOR US WE WERE LUCKY IN THAT THEY WERE. AS IT HAPPENED THAT MORNING. WE ARE SCHEDULED TO A FAMILY FUN RUN. A FIVE K. ORANGE COUNTY FAIRGROUNDS. WHAT A GREAT TIME UNTIL THE VERY END. AS WE PASS THE FINISH LINE FOR. ALL OF US INCLUDING MY CHILDREN FOR THEM EIGHT SIX AND THREE. WERE HANDED FLYERS OFFERING US FREE ADMISSION TO THE GUN SHOWS HAPPENING THE FOLLOWING WEEKEND. WHEN I WAS GROWING UP THE COUNTY FAIRGROUNDS WERE KNOWN FOR BEING FAMILY FRIENDLY. IN ADDITION THE COUNTY FAIR EACH YEAR THEY HAVE RODEOS FOUR H. EVENTS CONCERTS THE CIRCUS AND OTHER EVENTS LIKE THAT. BUT TODAY THEY'RE KNOWN PRIMARILY FOR GUN SHOWS. THE AVERAGE COUNTY FAIRGROUND ACROSS THE STATE HOSTS FIVE GUN SHOWS A YEAR. MINE IN ORANGE COUNTY TYPICALLY HOSTS EIGHT TO TWELVE COUNTRIES EACH YEAR. AND CONTRARY TO THE CLAIMS OF GUN SHOW PROPONENTS THESE SHOWS ARE ANYTHING BUT FAMILY FRIENDLY. IF YOU'VE EVER BEEN TO ONE OF THE SHOWS YOU KNOW THAT THEY'RE HOTBEDS OF EXTREMIST SENTIMENT. IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR T. SHIRTS MASTER OTHER PERIL IT SAYS F. GAVIN NEWSOM OR F. BITE AND- THIS IS THE PLACE TO GO. IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR SHOOTING TARGET SUPERIMPOSED ON POLITICIANS. TYPICALLY DEMOCRATS THIS IS THE PLACE TO GO. NOT AT THAT TIME I WAS RUNNING FOR THE SEAT I NOW HOLD. AND I FOUND THAT IF I ENDED UP BEING ELECTED I WOULD WORK TO END GUN SHOWS ON STATE PROPERTY IN ORANGE COUNTY. AND ACROSS THE STATE. AND THAT IS WHAT I'M HERE TRYING TO DO TODAY. HELLO PROPONENTS OF GUN SHOWS CLAIM GUN SHOWS ARE SAFE. AND ALSO LEGAL FIREARMS THIS IS NOT TRUE. TENSIONS ARE ESSENTIALLY A FLEA MARKET FOR FIREARMS. THEIR RIMARY MECHANISM BY WHICH UNLICENSED UNREGISTERED AND ILLEGAL FIREARMS OR TRAFFIC THROUGH SECONDARY MARKETS. MY STAFF RECENTLY ATTENDED A GUN SHOW AT THE ORANGE COUNTY FAIRGROUNDS AND WHILE THEY'RE WAITING IN LINE TO GET IN THEY WERE INUNDATED WITH OFFERS TO PURCHASE VARIOUS TYPES OF WEAPONS. BY PEOPLE WORKING THE LINES TO TRY TO MAKE OFF THE BOOKS TRANSACTIONS. ACCORDING TO GIFFORDS LAW CENTER TO PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE GUN SHOWS OFTEN CREATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CIRCUMVENT GUN SAFETY LAWS. AND ARE A COMMON VENUE FOR STRAW PURCHASES AN ILLEGAL GUN TRANSFERS. AT ZERO EIGHT ALCOHOL TOBACCO AND FIREARMS REPORT ALSO DESCRIBED GUN SHOWS AS A MAJOR TRAFFICKING CHANNEL. AND FOUND THE GUN SHOWS WERE THE SECOND LARGEST SOURCE OF ILLEGALLY TRAFFICKED FIREARMS IN THIS COUNTRY. AND ALSO TO SIX ARE NOT AVAILABLE BECAUSE DATA IS NOT COLLECTED THE SHOWS. IT'S WIDELY BELIEVED THE GUN SHOWSARE A MAJOR CONDUIT. PERHAPS THE MAJOR CONDUIT FOR THE SALE OF GHOST GUNS. WHICH ARE DONE PRECURSOR CURSOR PARTS DESIGNED TO BE ASSEMBLED INTO A WORKING FIREARM. BECAUSE THESE ARE NOT TECHNICALLY FIREARMS THEY DO NOT HAVE SERIAL NUMBERS AND NOT REGISTERED AT THE TIME OF SALE. INDEED WHEN I RECENTLY VISITED A GUN SHOW THE MOST POPULAR VENDORS. BY FAR WERE THE ONES SELLING THOSE KIND KITS. DESIGNED TO BE TURNED IN FIREARMS I CAME TO GLOCK PISTOLS AN A. R. FIFTEEN RIFLES. THIS AS YOU KNOW IS A TOP PRIORITY FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT. GHOST GUNS HAVE BECOME A COP USED IN CRIME. BUT I SAY EVEN IF THEY WERE ZERO SALES OF ILLEGAL NLICENSED OR GHOST GUNS. I WOULD EVER DO YOU THAT YOU SHOULD STILL SUPPORT THIS BILL BECAUSE GUN SHOWS ARE DESIGNED FOR ONE PURPOSE. TO SELL GUNS INDUSTRY BE GUNS IN OUR COMMUNITIES. AND THEY ARE INCREDIBLY EFFECTIVE AT THAT. THERE ARE NO REPORTED STATISTICS ON HOW MANY GUNS GET SOLD FROM THESE GUN SHOWS. IT IS CLEARLY A MASSIVE NUMBER. THOUSANDS OF FIREARMS MAYBE MORE ARE SOLD EACH DAY THERE'S A GUN SHOW. THAT'S THOUSANDS MORE FIREARMS THAT GO INTO OUR COMMUNITIES EVERY TIME THERE'S A GUN SHOW IN YOUR COUNTY. AND THIS IS SUCH A DEADLY DEADLY PROBLEM. AS STUDY AFTER STUDY AFTER STUDY HAS SHOWN. MORE GUNS UNSURPRISINGLY MEANS MORE GUN VIOLENCE. COUNTRIES WITH MORE GUNS HAVE MORE GUN VIOLENCE. STATES WITH MORE GUNS HAVE MORE GUN VIOLENCE. HOUSEHOLDS WITH MORE GUNS ARE MORE LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE GUN VIOLENCE. NOW SINCE THAT WEEKEND WHEN WE EXPERIENCE THE- PASO IN DAYTON SHOOTINGS. THE WEEKEND WHEN I VOWED AND GUN SHOWS AT THE COUNTY FAIR GROUNDS WE HAVE HAD HUNDREDS OF MASS SHOOTINGS. INCLUDING THE MASS SHOOTING LAST WEEK IN SAN JOSE. AND THE SHOOTING ORANGE IN MY DISTRICT EARLIER THIS YEAR. OVER FIFTY THOUSAND AMERICANS AND MANY CALIFORNIANS HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES. DUE TO GUN VIOLENCE INCLUDING THE NINE VICTIMS OF LAST WEEK'S SAN JOSE SHOOTING. AS WELL AS THIS COMPUTING WITH SIX YEAR OLD BOY. APPARENTLY DUE TO ROAD RAGE AND MY DISTRICT ON THE FIFTY FIVE JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO. NO WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THOSE GUNS WERE WERE PICKED UP. WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY'RE PURCHASED THE GUNS USED TO COMMIT THOSE MURDERS. BUT IT IS VERY LIKELY THAT MANY OF THEM HAVE COME FROM GUN SHOWS. EACH ONE OF THESE VIOLENT DEATHS. FOR A MASSIVE HOLE IN THEIR FAMILIES IN OUR COMMUNITIES AMONG THEIR LOVED ONES. NEVER POINTED SO THESE COUNTRIES ARGUE THAT ENDING GUN SHOWS WILL DEPRIVE THEM OF REVENUE. HE'S GONE SHOW CAN BRING IN UP TO HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO THE FAIRGROUNDS. BUT THIS IS JUST A SMALL FRACTION OF THE REVENUE GENERATED BY FAIRGROUNDS. MORE IMPORTANTLY THOUGH IT IS UNDISPUTABLE THAT THE COSTS OF GUN VIOLENCE ECONOMIC MORAL SPIRITUAL. ARE ASTRONOMICALLY HIGHER. THE OPPOSITION ALSO CLAIMS THAT THIS BILL GOES TOO FAR AND EACH COUNTY FAIRGROUNDS SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS ON WHETHER TO ACCEPT OR DENY GUN SHOWS AS A MATTER OF LOCAL CONTROL. AS A MATTER OF SUBSTANCE THIS IS INCORRECT. WHEN YOU TALK TO THE BOARD MEMBERS OF COUNTY FAIRGROUNDS. THEY WILL TELL YOU THAT THEY- NO FIDUCIARY DUTIES TO THE LOCAL COMMUNITY. THEIR SOLE DUTY. IS TO ENSURE THE SOLVENCY THEIR PROGRAMS AND THEY TELL YOU THAT THEY'RE OBLIGATED TO CONTRACT WITH GUN SHOW OPERATORS. NO MATTER WHAT THE PEOPLE IN THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITIES MIGHT WANT OR SAY. BUT I ALSO WANT TO PUSH BACK ON THE ARGUMENT LOCAL CONTROL AS A MATTER OF PRINCIPLE. THIS AUGUST BODY SETS THE STANDARD FOR THE STATE AND THEIR MANY INSTANCES IN WHICH WE DECIDE THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN STATEWIDE VALUES. THAT WE WANT TO DICTATE REGARDLESS OF WHAT LOCALS MIGHT THINK. WE REQUIRE THAT EVERY CHILD BE VACCINATED WITH DESPITE WHAT THE PROTESTERS OUTSIDE MIGHT MIGHT DEMAND. WE REQUIRE THAT WORKPLACES BE SAFE FROM DANGEROUS CONDITIONS OR SEXUAL HARASSMENT OR ASSAULT. WE REQUIRE THAT CERTAIN HEALTH AND LABOR STANDARDS BE MET WE DO THIS DESPITE THE FACT THAT OF COURSETHERE ARE SOME LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THAT MIGHT DISAGREE WITH OUR STATEWIDE VALUES. AND THAT IS WHAT THIS IS ABOUT TODAY IT'S ABOUT VALUES IF THIS BILL PASSES OUT HIS BODY WE WILL BE SAYING LOUDLY. THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS NOT GOING TO CONTINUE SANCTIONING. AND ENDORSING THE DISTRIBUTION OF MORE GUNS IN OUR COMMUNITIES OUT OF STATE PROPERTY. WELL WE RESPECT THE CONTOURS OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT. AND THE RIGHTS OF PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS TO LEGALLY SELL GUNS ON PRIVATE PROPERTY. WE DO NOT NEED TO ALLOW STATE PROPERTY. PROPERTY THIS TAXPAYER OWNED TO BE USED TO DISSEMINATE MORE GUNS. AND HENCE MORE GUN VIOLENCE IN OUR COMMUNITIES. IN TWO THOUSAND pBEEN OVER TWO HUNDRED THIRTY MASS SHOOTINGS NATIONWIDE. AND ALREADY OVER SEVENTEEN THOUSAND LIVES LOST TO GUN VIOLENCE. THIS SENSELESS VIOLENCE HAS RAVAGED COMMUNITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA. WHICH SHOOTINGS IN SANTA BARBARA SAN FRANCISCO. OAKLAND SANTA ANA SAN DIEGO COMPTON YUBA CITY STOCKED. ORANGE CITRUS HEIGHTS AND OF COURSE SAN JOSE. THE SECOND AMENDMENT ALLOWS PRIVATE PARTIES TO OWN GUNS BUT IT DOES NOT REQUIRE THAT OUR STATE PLAYED ACTIVE ROLE IN HELPING TO SELL MORE FIREARMS. I'M NOT IS ENOUGH THIS IS OUR CHANCE TO DRAW A LINE IN THE SAND AND SAY LOUDLY AND CLEARLY THAT THE GREAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA WILL NOT PROFIT OFF THE SALE OF GUNS. AND GUNVIOLENCE AND IT WILL NOT HELP TO DISSEMINATE MORE GUNS AND THE RESULTING GUN VIOLENCE IN OUR COMMUNITIES. I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. SENATOR NELSON. MADAM PRESIDENT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THE CENTER I WAS NOT INTENDING TO GET UP ON THIS BILL AND DEBATE BUT THE INTERPRETER MARKS AND I JUST LISTENED TO DISPOSE ME TO STAND UP AND SPEAK OUT FOR THE SECOND AMENDMENT AND AGAINST THOSE WHO DISDAIN THE SECOND AMENDMENT. WEST THE SECOND AMENDMENT. DO YOU EVER THINK OF WHO PULLS THE TRIGGER NO THIS LEGISLATURE AND ADMINISTRATION ARE RELEASING TENS OF THOUSANDS OF FELONS AND CRIMINALS INTO OUR COMMUNITIES. THEY DON'T USE GUNS ALL KNOW THOSE ARE ALL GOOD REHABILITATED SOULS. WE SHOULD LOCK THEM UP WELL WE'RE GOING TO CLOSE A PRISON. WHO WERE IN THE PRISONS. PEOPLE WHO HAVE USED GUNS AND OTHER WEAPONS. WOW. YOU WANT TESTIMONY TO HOW SUCCESSFUL THIS GUN CONTROL STUFF IS TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF THEIR GROUP. H. AND CITIES. NEW YORK COMES TO MIND CHICAGO COMES TO MIND. IT'S GOING TO CONTROLLER IS. DID SOMEBODY GET THE GUN YES. I DO NOT AGREE THE PEOPLE GO TO GUN SHOWS TO GET THE GUNS. TO COMMIT CRIMES. THAT'S MUCH TOO VISIBLE. AND I'VE DEALT WITH A LOT MORE KILLERS. USERS OF GUNS IN ANY OF YOU HAVE. AND IN READING THE RECORDS OF THESE INDIVIDUALS- CENTRAL FILES EVERYTHING ABOUT THEIR LIVES. I DON'T REMEMBER ONE WHO FIRED THE GUN AT A GUN SHOW. NOT JUST SOMEBODY PROBABLY STILL BUT THAT INFLAMED RHETORIC THAT WE'RE LISTENING TO HERE LADIES AND GENTLEMAN ENOUGH- URGING NO VOTE. CENTERING ON THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I RISE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF SB TWO SIXTY FOUR AND THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM ORANGE COUNTY FOR BRINGING THIS MATTER FORWARD I HAVE HEARD FROM THOUSANDS OF HUNDREDS OF CONSTITUENTS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN MY DISTRICT WITH CONCERNS RELATED TO THE SALE OF FIREARMS ON STATE PROPERTY. NAMELY FAIRGROUNDS EVERY SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC SAFETY CONCERNS INCLUDING ILLEGAL SALES THAT'S THE FIREARMS AND THE SALES OF PARTS AND INSTRUCTIONS TO CONVERTS STANDARD FIREARMS FIREARMS INTO MORE DANGEROUS WEAPONS. I ALSO RISE TODAY AS SOMEONE THAT ON MAY TWENTY THIRD TWENTY FOURTEEN. HAD TO CALL STUDENTS OF MINE AT UC SANTA. MY DISTRICT HAS NOT ONLY FACE TO THE MASS SHOOTING. PROBLEM IN CRISIS THAT WE HAVE IN OUR COUNTRY BUT I ALSO SHARE OF INTER COUNTY AND THINK OF THE BORDERLINE SITUATION IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. THIS IS ABOUT FINDING WAYS TO KEEP GUNS OUT OF FOLKS HANDS WHO SHOULDN'T HAVE THEM THIS IS A SAFETY MEASURE. I SHARE THE BELIEF THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SHOULD NOT BE IN THE BUSINESS OF FACILITATING GUN SALES. AND THAT THERE ARE MANY OTHER VENUES FOR CONSTITUENTS TO LEGALLY PURCHASE FIREARMS WITHOUT USING STATE PROPERTY. THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND I HAVE A- CENTER GROVE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR QUESTION THE AUTHOR PLEASE WE'LL BE OFF TO THE QUESTION. YES THROUGH THE CHAIR IN A CHAIR- FUTURITY AUTHOR IS THERE ANY DATA THAT YOU HAVE THAT SHOWS THAT ANY- CRIMINAL ACTIVITY HAS TAKEN PLACE THIS PLACE WITH FIREARMS PURCHASED FROM A GUN SHOW AT A STATE FACILITY I'M SORRY I HEAR THE QUESTION IS THERE ANY DATA OR INFORMATION THAT YOU CAN SHARE THAT SHOWS THAT- SOME CRIMINAL ACTIVITY OR A CRIMINAL ACTIVITY HAS TAKEN PLACE. WITH THESE FROM THE SALE OF OR A PURCHASE OF A FIREARM FROM AGAIN SHOW OR ON STATE PROPERTY AS I THINK I MENTIONED THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION I APPRECIATE THAT AND I THINK AS I MENTIONED IN MY OPENING REMARKS. OUR DATA IS NOT COLLECTED ARE PROVIDED BY THE OPERATORS OF THE GUN SHOW AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE ATF AND FBI DON'T COLLECT THAT DATA ANECDOTALLY WE KNOW THAT A LOT OF UNLICENSED AND ILLEGAL GUNS ARE SOLD I HAVE MANY REPORTS OF THAT HAPPENING. AS I MENTIONED MY STAFF WAS- OFFERED THE PURCHASE OF PRESUMABLY ILLEGAL WEAPONS WHEN THEY WERE WAITING IN LINE AND THAT THAT AN ECHO FROM MY STAFF WAS CONSONANT WITH WITH OTHER ACCOUNTS THAT I'VE HEARD BUT AGAIN THERE'S NO DATA ON THIS POINT. AND THAT'S UNFORTUNATELY PART OF THE PROBLEM HERE. I'M OWN TIME THINKING MADAM CHAIR ARM MISMATCH PRESIDENT- YOU KNOW I HAVE TO TELL YOU GUYS THAT- PEOPLE PURCHASE FIREARMS FROM THE SCANSHOWS ALL THE TIME THESE GUN SHOWS ARE A DRAW TO SEE IN- FIREMAN DIZZY AS PEOPLE THAT LIKE TO SHOOT FOR SPORT CHIEF- HUNTING. OR YOU KNOW SELF PROTECTION WHICH IS GUARANTEED- TO US UNDER THE CONSTITUTION. I CAN TELL YOU MY FAMILY MYSELF WE BOUGHT FIREARMS FRIEND- GUN SHOWS. WE'VE NEVER COMMITTED A CRIME WITH THEM. AND I CAN PROMISE YOU AND TELL YOU THAT THE CRIMINAL ELEMENT OUT THERE THE CRIMINAL ELEMENT. OUT THERE IS NOT GOING TO A GUN SHOW TO PURCHASE A FIREARM AND TO REGISTER TO APPLY FOR AN A AN APPLICATION THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO PROVIDE THEIR SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS OR DRIVER'S LICENSE NUMBER. AND ALL OF THAT INFORMATION THAT'S REQUIRED. THESE PEOPLE ARE NOT WAITING TEN DAYS OR THIRTY DAYS TO PURCHASE A FIREARM FOR MAKING SURE THAT THEY HAVE TO GO BACK AND PICK UP. THE CRIMINAL ELEMENT IS GETTING THEIR GUNS OFF THE STREET. NOT FROM THESE GUN SHOWS THESE GUN SHOWS ARE A LEGAL MECHANISM AND A WAY TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE- INDIVIDUALS WHO WANT TO PURCHASE FIREARMS FOR THEIR FAMILY- AND MAKE IT AVAILABLE TO THEM. IN THEIR AREAS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES WHERE THEY HAVE ACCESS TO THESE- STATE FAIRGROUNDS. IT IS A LOCAL CONTROL INTO IT- ISSUE. AND I AGREE AS WELL IF YOU DON'T WANT THEM IN ORANGE COUNTY WE LIKE THEM IN KERN COUNTY. AND IT DRAWS. A LOT OF FUNDRAISING MECHANISMS FOR COMMUNITIES- IN OUR COMMUNITY NONPROFITS. IT DRAWS- SUPPORT FOR THE BOYS AND GIRLS TRIBE CLUB SUPPORT FOR HOUSE BOYS CAMP IT IT IT. IT'S A WAY TO RAISE MONEY FOR THE COMMUNITY AS WELL. IT'S A GOOD USE OF RESOURCES FOR THE STATE THEY GET TO. REAP THE BENEFITS OF LEASING THE FACILITY AND I CAN GUARANTEE YOU AGAIN IF YOU TALK TO ANY LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER OR ANY PERSON THAT IS ENGAGED IN THIS TYPE OF ACTIVITY- ESPECIALLY ON THE LAW ENFORCEMENT SIDE WHETHER IT'S THE SHERIFF THE LOCAL POLICE DEPARTMENT POLICE TV'S. OR ATF. CRIMINAL ELEMENTS ARE NOT GO WE- TO THESE. TO PURCHASE A FIREARM. AND OBVIOUSLY WITH IT NEW DATA THAT'S UNDER THE GNU LINKER- THE SOFTWARE THAT'S AVAILABLE WHEN YOU GO TO PURCHASE A FIREARM OR AMMUNITION YOU HAVE TO PUT STUFF INTO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WEBSITE IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO G. NUMBER THEN YOU CAN'T PURCHASE IT IT'S DENIED A PURCHASE. AND THAT'S THE SAME THING THAT THESE THESE- FIREARMS DEALERS HAVE TO PASS OR USE WHEN THEY'RE SELLING FIREARMS AT A GUN DEALERSHIPS. IT IS NOT THE CRIMINAL ELEMENT THAT IS GETTING THESE FIREARMS AT THIS FACILITY IS A LAW ABIDING CITIZENS THAT ARE GOING TO PURCHASE FIREARMS OF THEIR CHOICE. UNDER THE CONSTITUTION WITH THEIR WHICH THEY ARE ALLOWED TO DO. AND I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A NO VOTE. SENATOR MELINDA IS. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT- AT THE SENATORS I RISE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL TODAY AND I WANT TO SAY THAT WHILE I SHARE THE INTENT THAT THE AUTHOR HAS WHICH IS TO REDUCE GUN VIOLENCE AND I THINK THAT IS A COMMON DENOMINATOR AMONG ALL OF THE SENATORS HERE IN THE CHAMBER. WORDS LIKE PRESUMABLY ANECDOTALLY ARE NOT WORDS THAT BELONG IN THE CONTEXT OF TRYING TO CONVINCE SOMEONE TO SUPPORT A PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT IS GOING TO KEEP PEOPLE FROM BEING ABLE TO EXERCISE A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT IS BEING OFFERED BY THE AUTHOR NOR ANYONE ELSE FRANKLY. TO SUGGEST THAT. MASS SHOOTINGS THAT TAKE PLACE IN CALIFORNIA ARE BEING CONDUCTED WITH WEAPONS THAT WERE PURCHASED AT A GUN SHOW. THAT EVIDENCE JUST ISN'T THERE THE AUTHOR CAN'T PRODUCE IT NO ONE IS PRODUCING IT IT IS ANECDOTAL IT IS PRESUMED. THAT IS A FOOL'S ERRAND TO GO DOWN THAT PATH TO SUGGEST THAT YOU THINK THIS IS TAKING PLACE IN BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE FIREARMS THEREFORE. WE SHOULD MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS POLICY. IT IS A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT FOR PEOPLE TO BEAR ARMS AND IT'S A RATE THAT THEY CHOOSE TO EXERCISE IN PURCHASING A FIREARM AT A GUN SHOW THAT HAPPENS TO BE ADDED AT A STATE FACILITY. MORE IMPORTANTLY USURPING THE AUTHORITY OF LOCALS I THOUGHT FOR THOSE WHO CAME FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS JEALOUSLY GUARDED I THOUGHT WE LIKE TO LOCAL CONTROL I GUESS EXCEPT IF IT'S FOR SOMETHING THAT WE DON'T LIKE. BECAUSE THEY'RE SELLING T. SHIRTS. THAT WE DISAGREE WITH OUR MASKS. THE I HAVE A MESSAGE ON IT THAT WE DON'T LIKE. BUT THE LOCALS DECIDE WHAT THEY WANT IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. THE LOCALS ARE VERY GOOD AT LETTING THEIR LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS KNOW WHAT THEY LIKE WHAT THEY DON'T LIKE AND THEY'RE VERY GOOD AT EXACTING CHANGE. FROM ORGANIZING WITHIN THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES TO LET THEIR LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS KNOW WHAT THEY WANT. AND I JUST AS A FINAL POINT. I DO FIND IT IRONIC THAT THIS BODY WILL HAPPILY VOTE FOR BILLS THAT ALLOW PEOPLE. TO BE LET OUT OF PRISON OR JAIL EARLY HAVING COMMITTED A CRIME. WITH A FIREARM BUT THEN YOU TURN AROUND AND YOU WANT TO. TARGET GUN PURCHASES AND IT'S- IT'S A LITTLE SCHIZOPHRENIC COULD BE ASKED ME SO I WOULD URGE A NO VOTE THANK YOU. SENATOR BRADFORD. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR HIGH RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF. SP TWO SIXTY FOUR WHICH IS A COMMON SENSE MEASURE I AM JUST KINDA BAFFLED AT THIS TERM CRIMINAL ELEMENT. YOU'RE A CRIMINAL IF YOU BUY A GUN LEGALLY AND YOU GO OUT AND COMMIT A MASS SHOOTING. EVERY MASS SHOOTING IN THIS COUNTRY SO FAR HAS BEEN BY A LEGALLY PURCHASED GUNS SO WHY NOT EMAIL HIM A CRIMINAL ELEMENT. THIRD NOTE DIFFERENT THAN THE SO CALLED BAD GUYS WHO'VE BEEN RELEASED OUT OF PRISON EARLY WHO HAVE NO EVIDENCE OF THE ON GOING OUT AND COMMITTING MASS SHOOTINGS AND KILLING PEOPLE WITH FIREARMS THIS IS A COMMON SENSE MEASURE AT SOME POINT WE HAVE TO SAY. ANOTHER WAS ENOUGH HOW MANY GUNS DO WE NEED ON THE STREET HOW MANY ASSAULT WEAPONS DO WE NEED TO OWN HERE IN CALIFORNIA HOW MANY. MORE PEOPLE HAVE TO LOSE THEIR LIFE. HAS A SIX YEAR OLD DRIVING DOWN THE STREET WITH HIS MOTHER ON THE WAY TO SCHOOL. SHOP BY SOMEONE WHO PROBABLY LEGALLY OWNS A GUN. SO WHAT WOULD THIS CRIMINAL ELEMENT THE CRIMINAL ELEMENT IS THE PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING OUT KILLING INNOCENT PEOPLE EVERY DAY WHAT DO YOU HAVE A RICHER GONE OR NOT I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. SENATOR NELSON. MATTER PRESENT LADIES GEM OF THE SENATE FOR A SECOND TIME IN MY PREVIOUS DEBATE AT THE NIGHT NOT MENTIONED SOMETHING. AND THAT'S- THE PREVIOUS ATTORNEYS GENERAL OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ONLY A HANDFUL OF US HAVE WAXED OUTRAGE THAT THESE ATTORNEYS GENERAL HAVE MADE NO PROGRESS. CONFISCATING THE GUNS LAW REQUIRES THEM TO. WHERE THERE'S A FELON WHO HAS USED A GUN AND HAS BEEN RELEASED. UNDER ORDER OF LAW HAVING SERVED THEIR TIME THAT THEY ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO HAVE DONE. BUT A. HUNDRED THOUSAND. ALTHEA NOW THAT DOESN'T MEAN ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND GUNS THAT'S ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE. WHO ARE PROHIBITED ARMED PROHIBITED PERSONS. AND YOU KNOW DARN WELL THAT MOST OF THEM HAVE MORE THAN ONE GUY. BUT THE ATTORNEYS GENERALIZATIONS HAD THEIR STAFF COME BEFORE THE BUDGET COMMITTEE. ONE YEAR IT WAS WELL HOW MUCH WOULD IT TAKE. TO CLEAN UP. THE WHOLE BACKLOG. ALL TWENTY MILLION OKAY WE GIVE TWENTY MILLION ALL YEAR LATER THAT'S WHY I DIDN'T GO DOWN. WELL WE COULDN'T HIRE ENOUGH PEOPLE. BECAUSE WE CAN'T PAY AS HIGH A SALARY AS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS- STILL ANOTHER YEAR GOES BY IF YOU KNOW THE TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS. HI NO PROGRESS MADE. AND YET NO PROGRESS MADE STILL. THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO ORDER KNOWN. CONVICTED HELLO WELL WE WILL GET AROUND TO IT SOMEDAY. NOW IF WE CAN'T GET WITH THOSE INDIVIDUALS WE KNOW WHERE THEY'RE AT AND- ALL THAT LEAVES ME TURNING GENERAL JUST DOES NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES. WELL I SAY THAT WE TAKE THAT AWAY FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND GIVE IT TO SOMEBODY WHO COULD DO THE JOB AND GIVE THE MONEY TO LOCAL POLICE. AND SHERIFF'S. NOT SOMEONE TO HAVE A GREAT FIGURE IN THAT. BECAUSE THEY WANT TO DESTROY LAW ENFORCEMENT IN AMERICA. OR DOWNSIZE OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT CAPABILITIES. THIS IS A NEVER NEVER LAND FOLKS. BUT TAKE A LOOK. WHO'S CREATED SOME OF THE PROBLEMS. YOUR ATTORNEYS GENERAL. ONE OF. IT'S BEEN A IT'S BEEN REFERENCE THE DATA IS NOT COLLECTED I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT- WE REMINDED FOLKS THAT IN TWENTY TWENTY- THE LEGISLATURE PASSED ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY SIXTY ONE WHICH I AUTHORED THAT WORKED TO COLLECT DATA- WE DO HAVE EVIDENCE THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE HAD FOUND ILLEGAL SALES BUT WE WANTED TO KNOW HOW MUCH OF A PROBLEM THIS WAS AND THEREFORE THIS LEGISLATURE DID PASS- THIS. THIS BILL IT WAS SUPPORTED BY OUR ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE AND- THERE WAS NO OPPOSITION THAT WAS RECEIVED FOR THAT BILL AS I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE ALSO EXISTING TOOLS THAT WOULD COMPLEMENT AT THIS BILL. THANK YOU. SENATOR BURGESS. WHEN PRESIDENT I WASN'T. I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO GET INTO A CAR I NEED TO GET INTO- THE POINTS THAT WERE MADE EARLIER BUT MAYBE I COULD POSE A QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR AND IF HE'S NOT IN A POSITION TO ANSWER IT- MAYBE I CAN GET THE INFORMATION SOMETIME LATER WOULD IT BE EXPRESSED WRITTEN OF THE AUTHOR. HE WILL TAKE IT THERE. SO MY QUESTION TO YOU IS I'M HEARING TWO DIFFERENT SIDES OF THIS ARGUMENT EACH SIDE SEEMS TO BE LOVING- FAX OR GENERALIZATION OF FACTS I SHOULD SAY AGAINST ONE ANOTHER. SO WHERE IS THE DATA ON THIS AND IF CALIFORNIA HAS NOT ACCUMULATED MAYBE OTHER STATES HAVE. WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE CRIMES- THAT ARE ON THE RECORD CAN BE TRACED TO A GUN SHOW PURCHASE. WHAT PERCENTAGE OF% CRIMES OR INVOLVED LLEGALLY OBTAINED FIREARMS- I THINK WE HEARD FROM ONE OF OUR COLLEAGUES THAT ALL THE MASS SHOOTINGS WERE FROM- THAT WE'VE EXPERIENCED AMERICA ARE FROM FIREARMS PURCHASED LEGALLY I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT. AND I WOULD LOVE IF SOMEBODY WOULD PUT SOME SCIENCE AND DATA INTO THIS DEBATE BECAUSE RIGHT NOW IT SENDS TENS TO BE VISCERAL. AND VERY PASSIONATE BUT I THINK IT'S HELPFUL FOR US TO FIGURE OUT WHERE WE ARE. ON THE METRICS. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION. I WOULD BE EAGER TO WORK WITH YOU SENATOR ON MEASURES TO FIND MORE DATA AS YOU KNOW CONGRESS HAS. FOR A LONG TIME HAD A BAN ON RESEARCH RELATED TO FIREARMS- AND FATALITIES- AND SO THAT IS OBVIOUSLY HAMPERED SOME OF THIS WAS JUST STARTING TO COLLECT THE DATA- AS I MENTIONED BEFORE WE DON'T HAVE DATA ON WHERE THE GUNS GO. AT IT IS NOT COLLECTED- WE DO I WAS TOLD THAT THAT THE IT SORT OF ROUGH ESTIMATE MANY COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA. IS THAT ROUGHLY HALF OF GUNS ARE SOLD AT GUN SHOWS AND AS IN COMMUNITIES LIKE ORANGE COUNTY. AND SO IF YOU WERE TO SAY THAT A GUN THAT WAS LEGALLY PURCHASED. WAS USED IN A CRIME AND I WANT TO ECHO MY COLLEAGUE FROM MARTINEZ POINTS THAT. YOU KNOW A LOT OF THE CRIMINAL ELEMENT TO IT YOU KNOW. THAT THE PURCHASE OF GUNS LEGALLY THEY'RE NOT CRIMINALS UNTIL THEY GO SHOOT SOMEONE- BUT- YOU KNOW I THINK YOU COULD PROBABLY HAVE A COIN FLIP I WOULD SAY IT'S A COIN FLIP. AT THE TWO RECENT SHOOTINGS IN ORANGE THE SHOOTING ON THE FIFTY FIVE OF THE SIX YEAR OLD BOY IN HIS CAR SEAT. THE MASS SHOOTING WE KNOW THOSE GUNS WERE WHAT WE KNOW THAT THE FIRST GUN THE GUNS USED IN MASS SHOOTINGS LEGALLY PURCHASED THE GUNS. ARE SO IT'S A COIN FLIP US ARE SAYING THIS TO SOME FOLKS- AT THE AG'S OFFICE. PROBABLY CONFLICT THAT THAT THOSE GUNS WERE PURCHASED AT A GUN SHOW GIVEN THAT IT WAS IN ORANGE COUNTY. BUT WE DON'T HAVE THE DATA SO I WOULD BE EAGER TO WORK ITH YOU AND OTHERS IN THIS BODY. TO TRY TO FIND THAT DATA WE DO KNOW THIS HOWEVER THAT. MORE GUNS EQUALS MORE GUN VIOLENCE AND I THINK THAT YOU KNOW I JUST WANNA BE CLEAR THAT THERE'S BEEN SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT MASS SHOOTINGS. CRIMINAL ELEMENT- YOU KNOW THEY COULD BE SUICIDE ACCIDENT IT COULD BE SOMEONE A DOMESTIC DISPUTE AND BY THE WAY MOST GUN SHOOTINGS THAT HAPPENED APPEARS IN IN THE PAST YEAR A NICKEL BID. FOR DOMESTICALLY VIOLENT ASSAULTS AND SUICIDE. AND THOSE ARE THE TYPES OF SHOOTINGS THAT WE SAW HAPPEN QUITE FREQUENTLY. AND AS YOU KNOW IF YOU FOLLOW SUICIDE STATISTICS- TYPICALLY IF YOU'RE NOT USING A GUN THE FIRST ATTEMPT AT SUICIDE DOESN'T SUCCEED. AND THEN TYPICALLY THEY GET HELP AND SO THERE'S SOME ABILITY TO REHABILITATE THEMSELVES. OUT WITH A GUN IF YOU OWN A GUN THE LIKELIHOOD OF COURSE THAT YOU COULD PUT YOURSELF IN A SUCCESSFUL THAT SUICIDE IS CLOSE TO A HUNDRED PERCENT- SO. YOU KNOW THESE ARE THE TYPES OF THINGS WERE SAYING BUT THERE IS A VERY VERY CLEAR INDICATION THAT JUST TAKE MY WORD FOR THE HARVARD INJURY CONTROL SPENT- IN RESEARCH CENTER. IN MANY MANY OTHER SCHOLARS HAVE REPEATEDLY FOUND THIS STUDY AFTER STUDY AFTER STUDY. SHOWS A VERY STRONG CORRELATION BETWEEN. THE AMOUNT OF GUNS THE AVAILABILITY OF GUNS IN THE COMMUNITY OR HOUSEHOLD. AND THE LIKELIHOOD OF GUN VIOLENCE. HANK YOU AND I AND I WOULD LIKE. IF I CAN GET SOME. GET SOMEBODY FOR. OF THE FACT THAT WE- DON'T HAVE IT. ACCUMULATED I THINK IT'S A LITTLE SHOCKING ESPECIALLY AS- WE'RE MOVING FORWARD ON PUBLIC POLICY. THAT DEALS WITH A CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED RIGHT. THAT IF WE ARE FLYING BLIND BLIND OR ANECDOTALLY. THAT WE PAUSE. AND IN THE INTEREST OF GOOD PUBLIC POLICY ACCUMULATE SS. AND DISCUSS THESE ISSUES. ON THE MERITS BASED ON THE METRICS- I THINK THAT WOULD BE FOR. A MUCH STRONGER. NON REFLEXIVE TYPE OF PUBLIC POLICY. AND I KNOW THAT YOU WERE A CAR LOT PROFESSOR FELLOW PROFESSOR SO I WOULD JUST POINT OUT TO YOU. THAT THE SECOND AMENDMENT PROTECTS AN INDIVIDUAL RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS AND THAT WITH THE DECISION WAS DECIDED IN HELLER RECENTLY- BYE THAT DOES NOT GO TO THE STATES AND COURTS THE TENTH AMENDMENT RESERVES A SIGNIFICANT POWERS TO THE STATES. I BELIEVE THIS BILL IS A 100% CONSISTENT AND CONSTANT WITH THE SECOND AMENDMENT I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S IN TEMPERATE TO CALL THIS. CONSISTENT WITH THE SEGMENT RIGHTS I HAVE NOT HEARD ANY ARGUMENT AS TO WHY THIS WOULD BE AN INFRINGEMENT ON THE SECOND AMENDMENT BECAUSE IT IS SIMPLY SAYING THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. CAN DO WHATEVER IT WANTS WITH ITS OWN PROPERTY AND AGAIN GIVEN THE HIGH CORRELATION BETWEEN GUNS AND GUN VIOLENCE. I THINK IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT THIS IS GOOD PUBLIC POLICY BECAUSE THE STATE SHOULD NOT BE PROFITING FOR EVERY HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR GUN SHOW. WE'RE PROBABLY INCREASING SIGNIFICANTLY THE LIKELIHOOD OF SIGNIFICANT COSTNER'S CASA GRANDE BY ONCE IN THE STATE ARE MUCH HIGHER. THAN A TINY. BIT OF REVENUE THAT WE'RE RECEIVING FROM GUNSHIPS. SENATOR COULD. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT- ARISING IN SUPPORT OF SB TWO SIXTY FOUR BUT I DO WANT TO CLARIFY THE REASON FOR MY SUPPORT- IN THE I WANTED TO- GO OUT OF MY WAY TO DISASSOCIATE MYSELF IN THIS BOAT- WITH ANY INDICTMENT ON FREE SPEECH ACTIVITIES THAT WOULD OCCUR IN FAIRGROUNDS OR OTHER STATE- PROPERTIES- I WANT TO DISASSOCIATE MYSELF WITH ANY VILIFICATION OF LEGAL VENDORS WHO DEAL IN THE SALE OF FIREARMS OR HAVE THROUGH AT FAIR GROUNDS OR THERE'S THE PROPERTIES- AND I THINK- TO SOME EXTENT THE OPPOSITION. IN THE ANALYSIS IS POINTED OUT IN RIGHTFULLY SO THAT YOU CAN ASSOCIATE CALIFORNIA REGULATION OF THESE GUN SHOWS WITH A NATIONAL STATISTICS BECAUSE HERE THE LEGISLATURE HAS DONE A TREMENDOUS JOB OF MAKING SURE THAT BACKGROUND CHECKS ARE IN PLACE THE REQUIREMENTS FOR GUN LOCKS AND SAFES AND ALL OF THE THINGS THAT ARE REQUIRED BY RETAIL DEALERS ARE PRESENT IN THESE GUN SHOWS- SO WHY AM I SUPPORTING THE BILL I'M SUPPORTING THE BILL BECAUSE I DON'T THINK. THAT IT'S NECESSARY OR PROPER FIRST AID TO CALIFORNIA PROPERTY TO BE USED- IN THIS MANNER IN HIM I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT I CLARIFY FOR MYSELF AND FOR THE RECORD- A LITTLE BIT OF A DISTINCTION BETWEEN- MY SUPPORT FOR THE BILL AND SOME OF THE ARGUMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN- TOSSED AROUND.

THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS ON THIS BILL AS BEFORE FIFTY NINE GIVES THE PUBLIC ARE PRESSING LAWMAKERS MORE TIMELY AND USEFUL INFORMATION ABOUT THE MILLIONS pTHE FATE OF LEGISLATION IN CALIFORNIA. SO IN OUR STATE. OUR LOBBYING FIRMS AND INTEREST GROUPS THAT THOSE THOSE INTEREST GROUPS THAT HIRE THE FIRM IS THEY HAVE TO FILE QUARTERLY REPORTS ON THEIR LOBBYING ACTIVITY ONCE ONE MONTH. AFTER THE CLOSING EACH QUARTER THE THIRD QUARTER REPORT COVERS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT LESS THAN A QUARTER OF THE YEAR JULY. THROUGH SEPTEMBER NOW I DON'T THINK I HAVE TO EXPLAIN ANYONE HERE EXCEPT FOR PERHAPS OUR NEWEST MEMBERS. THAT DURING THAT THIRD QUARTER LITERALLY MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. ARE SPENT TO INFLUENCE LEGISLATION- AND YET THE DISCLOSURE DOES NOT OCCUR. UNTIL AFTER THE LEGISLATURE HAS ALREADY DECIDED WHICH BILLS. TO PASTOR DEFEAT AND AFTER THE GOVERNOR HAS DECIDED WHICH SPILLS TO SIGN OR VETO. AND THIS- FAILS THEN TO PROVIDE ANY USEFUL DISCLOSURES ARE TRANSPARENCY WHEN THE FATE OF LEGISLATION IS DECIDED. SO SOMETHING THAT NEARLY HALF OF THE STATE OF THE UNION ROOFTOP PROVIDE. FOR THE MONTHLY REPORTING REQUIREMENTS MORE IN SOME INSTANCES EVEN MORE FREQUENT REPORTING. AND IT'S REALLY GOT BECOME MIGHT BELIEVE THAT CALIFORNIA HAS TO DO MORE NOW TO ENSURE. THAT POLICY MAKERS THE PRESS THE PUBLIC HAVE MORE TIMELY AND USEFUL INFORMATION ABOUT THE LOBBYING IMPACTING PUBLIC POLICY. SO THIS BILL EXPEDITES THE ADVOCACY ACTIVITY REPORTING FROM QUARTERLY TO MONTHLY FOR THE HIGH SPENDING LOBBYING FIRMS AND INTEREST GROUPS AND REQUIRES THEM TO INDICATE THE SUPPORT. OR OPPOSE POSITIONS THAT THEY TAKE DURING THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. RATHER THAN SIMPLY LISTING THE BILL NUMBERS AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE- IT GIVES THEM SOME INSIDE SOME WINDOW INTO INTO WHAT- WHAT IT WHAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY DOING. THE BILL ALSO REQUIRES REPORTS OF SPENDING ON ISSUE DS. WITHIN SEVENTY TWO HOURS AND REQUIRES INTEREST GROUPS TO PUT THEIR NAMES ON THEIR HEADS.

TEEN MOTHERS RECEIVE ANY FINANCIAL SUPPORT FROM THERE FOR CHARLOTTE FROM THEIR CHILD'S FATHER. 80% OF TEENS FATHERS DO NOT MARRY THE TEEN GIRLS WHO BORE THEIR CHILD. FATHERS OF CHILDREN BORN TO TEENS ARE ON THE AVERAGE ALMOST FOUR YEARS OLDER THAN THE MOTHERS. CAN A MAJORITY IS OVER THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE. FOR LOW INCOME TEAM TO MAKE UP APPROXIMATELY 40% OF THE ADOLESCENT POPULATION AND ACCOUNT FOR EIGHTY THREE. PERCENT OF TEENS WHO GIVE BIRTH.

PATIENTS MUST PAY EVERY YEAR ALL OF THE MEDICAL AND PHARMACY FOR EXPENSES UP TO THE DOCTOR BULL BEFORE THEY- GET ANY COVERAGE WHERE THEY'RE ALSO PAYING COPAYS FOR COVERED SERVICES. MANY STUDIES SHOW THAT PATIENT NON ADHERENCE TO PRESCRIBED MEDICATIONS LEADS TO POOR. OUTCOMES AND PROGRESSION OF THE DISEASE THAT'S ESTIMATED TO BE IN BILLIONS OF AVOIDABLE DIRECT HEALTH CARE COSTS. OF COURSE ALSO ADDITIONAL SIDE- COST AS WELL. THIS BILL DOESN'T ELIMINATE COPAYS OR PATIENT COST SHARES. ELIMINATES THE DEDUCTIBLE FOR CHRONIC DISEASE MEDICATION THAT PERFECT THAT PREVENTS THEM FROM BEING ABLE TO AFFORD THE MEDICATION IN THE FIRST PLACE BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO.

THESE FAKE FAKE FAKE THESE FAKE BANK ACCOUNTS WHICH ARE SOLD BY ALTERNATIVE FINANCIAL SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE DYING ARE DESIGNED TO ENCOURAGE OVERDRAFT FEES THAT PUT LOW INCOME CONSUMERS IN A VULNERABLE AN ENDLESS CYCLE OF DEBT THIS BILL CLOSES AN IMPORTANT PEOPLE THAT WILL PROTECT VULNERABLE FAMILIES TO ENSURE STATE FUNDS ARE USED APPROPRIATELY AND EFFICIENTLY AND MAKE IT CLEAR THAT PUBLIC ASSISTANCE SHOULD NOT BE SUBJECT TO OVER DRAFT FEES SUCH AS UNEMPLOYMENT.

NOW ARE YOU PREPARED. HE IS PLEASE READ. SENATE BILL FIFTEEN BY SENATOR PORTMAN TINO AND ACTS RELATED TO HOUSING. ENTER PARDON TINO THE FORAGERS THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS TODAY I'M PRESENTING SP FIFTEEN WHICH WILL GIVE INCENTIVES TO CITIES THAT CONVERT ABANDONED RETAIL SITES INTO AFFORDABLE HOUSING SPECIFICALLY SP FIFTEEN WILL ENABLE LOCAL CITIES TO RECEIVE FROM H. E. D. THE AVERAGE OF THE ANNUAL AMOUNT OF SALES TAX REVENUE GENERATED. BY THAT SITE FOR THE LAST SEVEN YEARS IF THE SITE HAS BEEN CONVERTED IN OCCUPIED WITH NEW AFFORDABLE HOUSING THESE FISCAL INCENTIVES WILL BE USED BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO REPLACE THE SALES TAX REVENUE LOSS FROM THE CLOSURE OF THESE BIG BOX RETAILERS AS WE ALL KNOW CALIFORNIA IS IN A HOUSING. CRISIS AND CITIES HAVE LONG BEEN INCENTIVIZED TO CREATE RETAIL OVER HOUSING THIS BILL SEEKS TO SWITCH THAT PARADIGM CREATE A- EFFORT THAT BOTH HOUSING ACTIVISTS- BUSINESS COMMUNITY AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ALL LIGHT BECAUSE IT'S INCENTIVE BASED AND WILL LEAD TO MORE AFFORDABLE AND WORKFORCE HOUSING. IF YOU COULD JUST WAIT A SECOND WE'LL GET YOU BACK ON LINE. GET YOUR LAST COUPLE OF SENTENCES EIGHT SEEDED BY EIGHT SEEDED MY TIME LIMIT I GUESS- RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR ANOTHER VOTE. IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. CENTER GROVE. IT IS REPORTED AS WAIT A SECOND WE'LL GET YOU WANT TO CHECK THRE YOU GO THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION BECAUSE OPPOSE RECOMMENDATION- BASED ON SOME COST FACTORS IN THIS BILL BUT THE THEORY OF THE BILL TO TAKE THESE- BIG BOX STORES AND TURNING INTO HOUSING PROJECTS IS A BRILLIANT IDEA- IT'S EVEN A MORE BRILLIANT IDEA TO ALLOW A BACK FILL FOR TAX CREDITS- MOST OF YOU GUYS DON'T KNOW THAT KERN COUNTY PRODUCES 51% OF THE STATE'S RENEWABLE ENERGY. I THINK WE'RE ALL ABOUT OIL BUT BASICALLY 51% OF THE ENERGY THAT'S RENEWABLE THAT HELPS THE GOVERNOR AND ALL OF YOU MEET YOUR CLIMATE CHANGE GOALS COMES FROM MY DISTRICT IN THE ENERGY GOES NORTH AND SOUTH BUT WE GET NO TAX INCENTIVE WHATSOEVER ON IT BECAUSE THESE PEOPLE THAT HAVE THESE OCCUPIED THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF ACRES FOR SOLAR PROJECTS WE DON'T GET THE TAX INCENTIVES OR THE TAX- THEY DON'T PAYTAXES AND SO WE CAN'T USE A TIRE LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND ALL THOSE THINGS SO TO ADD THAT PROVISION IN THE BILL IS ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT BECAUSE AND YOUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES WOULD BE ABSENT THAT TAX REVENUE THAT THOSE BIG ABOUT BIG BOX STORES WOULD NORMALLY PAY- IF THIS DOES TURN INTO A HOUSING PROJECT SO I JUST THANK YOU FOR MAKING SURE THAT THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES ARE COVERED UNDER THIS SECTION AS WELL. ANY FURTHER TO. DEBATE CENTER PARTY NO YOU MAY CONCLUDE GREAT THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR THOSE COMMENTS AND I WOULD JUST LIKE TO ADD THAT A CRITICAL PIECE OF THIS IS THE JOBS GONNA CREATE AND THE PROTECTIONS FOR THOSE WORKERS ARE IMPORTANT AS WELL AS MAKING SURE THAT THE FOLKS WHO BUILT THESE FOUR DOUBLE HOUSING UNITS HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO PURCHASE THOSE HOUSING UNITS AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FRIEND ABOUT.

FIVE THIRTY EIGHT NO ZERO THE MEASURE PASSES MEMBERS WE'RE GOING TO GO BACK TO ITEM NUMBER SIXTY THREE SENATOR LEYVA SHE IS PREPARED PLEASE READ. SENATE BILL SEVEN TWENTY SEVEN BY SENATOR LEYVA AND ACTUALLY INTO EMPLOYMENT. SENATOR LABOR YOU MAY PROCEED THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS SP SEVEN TWENTY SEVEN AIMS TO PREVENT WAGE THEFT WITHIN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT WE ARE SEEKING TO GO AFTER THE BAD ACTORS IN THE INDUSTRY AND TO HELP THOSE THAT PLAY BY THE RULES AND MAKE SURE THAT THEIR WORKERS ARE PAID ON TIME. CALIFORNIA'S CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY BUILT OUR WORLD CLASS INFRASTRUCTURE IS A KEY DRIVER OF THE STATE'S ECONOMY AND PROVIDED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF HOUSING UNITS ANNUALLY TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF A GROWING CALIFORNIA POPULATION. DUE TO THE SKILLS REQUIRED AND THE FAIR WAGES AND BENEFITS WORKERS RECEIVED THE INDUSTRY PROVIDED A PATHWAY TO MIDDLE CLASS FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS FOR TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CONSTRUCTION WORKERS WHO COULD THEN AFFORD TO PURCHASE THE HOMES THAT THEY BUILT. UNFORTUNATELY FOR MORE THAN THE LAST FORTY YEARS THOSE STANDARDS HAVE GRADUALLY BEEN ERODING ACCORDING TO THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT CRITERIA. OVER 50% OF CALIFORNIA'S CONSTRUCTION WORKFORCE FAMILY FAMILIES CURRENTLY FALL IN LOW INCOME CATEGORIES LESS THAN 80% OF THE MEDIAN FAMILY INCOME. OVER ONE THIRD OF ALL CONSTRUCTION FAMILIES ARE CLASSIFIED AS VERY LOW INCOME EARNING LESS THAN 50% OF THE MEDIAN FAMILY INCOME. LIKE MANY OTHER SECTORS CONSTRUCTION WAGES HAVE GONE DOWN BUT WAGE THEFT IN CASH PAYMENTS HAVE INCREASED AT A KEY FACTOR FOR THIS IS THE LACK OF ENFORCEMENT OF BASIC LABOR LAWS ON JOBSITES. UNSCRUPULOUS CONTRACTORS THAT DO NOT PLAY BY THE RULES HAVEN'T ILLEGAL AND UNFAIR ADVANTAGE OVER HONEST CONTRACTORS AS THEY UNDERMINED WAGES AND WORKING CONDITIONS THROUGHOUT THE INDUSTRY. BUT I WILL SHARE WITH YOU THAT A B. SEVENTEEN OH ONE BY SOMEONE MEMBER THEN ASSEMBLYMEMBER THURMAN WHICH TOOK EFFECT IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN HAS MADE A DIFFERENCE. IT HAS NOT DONE ENOUGH SOME CONTRACTORS STILL CONSIDER WAGE THEFT JUST THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS. COLLEAGUES AT THIS TIME THAT WE TREAT WAGE THEFT IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY SIMILAR TO HOW WE DO I OTHER INDUSTRIES. HOWEVER MEMBERS I DO REMAIN COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH CIA AND THE SPONSORS TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH PAYROLL MONITORING. THAT IS NOT OVERLY BURDENSOME AND TO CREATING A WORKSITE ENVIRONMENT THE CHANGES THE CULTURE OF NEGLIGENCE BOTH CAN BE ACHIEVED MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. VOTE. SENATOR ATKINS. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SB SEVEN TWENTY SEVEN FOR TWO SIMPLE REASONS AS ALREADY INDICATED BY THE AUTHOR IT PROTECTS CONSTRUCTION WORKERS WAGES AND HELPS LAW ABIDING CONTRACTORS COMPETE IN AN INDUSTRY THAT HAS LONG BEEN PLAGUED BY WAGE THEFT. ALSO AS INDICATED IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN- AB SEVENTY NO ONE BY THEN ASSEMBLYMEMBER THURMAN I SUPPORTED THAT BILL WHICH MAY GENERAL CONTRACTORS JOINTLY LIABLE FOR THE WAGES OWED BY THEIR SUBCONTRACTORS TO THE WORKERS IT WAS AND IT CONTINUES TO BE AN IMPORTANT VICTORY FOR WORKERS AND NOT JUST THOSE LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE REPRESENTED BY A UNION BUT FOR ALL CONSTRUCTION WORKERS THE FOLKS WHO BUILD OUR GROCERY STORES PLACES OF WORSHIP COMMUNITIES AND OUR HOMES. BUT CHANGE IS NOT EASY ESPECIALLY FOR AN INDUSTRY IS COMPLEX AND TRANSITORY AS CONSTRUCTION WHICH IS WHY WE MUST PUSH A LITTLE MORE TO ENSURE THE CULTURE OF NEGLECT ON JOBSITES IS REPLACED WITH ONE OF FAIR COMPETITION AND SHARED RESPONSIBILITY FOR BOTH WORKERS AND LAW ABIDING BUSINESSES. MY COLLEAGUE FROM CHINO HAS WORKED VERY HARD TO ENSURE THAT SB SEVEN TWENTY SEVEN REPRESENTS BOTH FAIRNESS. IN THE SHARED RESPONSIBILITY FOR WORKERS AND CONTRACTORS BY INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO Q. WERE A VIOLATION. WITHOUT ANY PENALTIES AS LONG AS THE PROPER STEPS ARE TAKEN. WORKERS NEED THEIR EMPLOYERS FOR THEIR LIVELIHOOD AND CONTRACTORS CAN BE ONLY AS THE ONLY BE SUCCESSFUL WITH THE SKILLED LABOR AND HARD WORK OF THEIR EMPLOYEES. I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES FOR THE GREAT WORK ON THIS BILL INCLUDING THE SENATOR FROM CHINO. THE CHAIR OF SENATE LABOR COMMITTEE AND THE CHAIR OF THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE AND WHAT THAT I ASK FOR YOUR I. SENATOR AWESOME. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. IS THE SEVENTY SEVEN MAKES ONE CHANGE IN EXISTING LAW EXTENDS JOINT LIABILITY TO ANY CONTRACTOR THAT HIRES A SUBCONTRACTOR. WHO DOES NOT RESPECT THE LAWS FOR THE WORKERS THAT'S ALL I THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD A SUBCONTRACTOR HAS TO KEEP RECORDS THAT'S A LOT AND THEY HAVE TO PAY MINIMUM WAGE THAT'S THE LAW. UNFORTUNATELY SO MANY WHO WORK IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN IMAGINE CONSTRUCTION WORKERS WITH THEIR SKILLS BEING PAID BELOW THE CALIFORNIA POVERTY STANDARD WORK IN THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY THAT IS PAID CASH OFF THE BOOKS IS DESCRIBED AS RAMPANT BY THE CALIFORNIA BUREAU OF FIELD ENFORCEMENT. IN A RECENT CASE OF MORE THAN ONE MILLION DOLLARS OF WEIGHT TO THEM THE SONG WAS THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY SAID SHE COULD NOT IDENTIFY MANY OF THE WORKERS BECAUSE OF THE SCANDAL EMPLOYEE RECORDS HONEST GENERAL CONTRACTORS CAN AND THEY DO KNOW WHAT THEIR SUBCONTRACTORS ARE DOING ON THE JOB. IF YOU ABIDE BY THE LAW AND MONITOR YOUR SUBCONTRACTORS YOU WILL OT BE LIABLE COLLEAGUES YOU'VE HEARD ME SPEAK ABOUT GARMENT WORKERS AND SOMETIMES ABOUT FARM WORKERS ALL THEY'RE ASKING FOR IS TO GET PAID BY THE LAW. R. MARKER JR FIVE OH THANK. YOU SENATOR HERTZBERG. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MADAM PRESIDENT JUST WANTED TO ACKNOWLEDGE AS THIS MEASURE WENT THROUGH THE PROCESS THAT THE AUTHOR ACCEPTED THE CONTRACTORS AMENDMENTS WHICH PROVED TO BE QUITE REASONABLE THAT RELIEVE THE GENERAL CONTRACTOR OF ANY ADDED LIABILITIES IF THEY TAKE THE FOLLOWING. THREE INTERVALS ONE WE ARE LIKELY REVIEW LEGALLY REQUIRED PAY WAR RECORDS OF THEIR SUBS TO TAKE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS UPON BECOMING AWARE OF A FAILURE TO PROPERLY PAY THEIR WORKERS INCLUDING WITHHOLDING PROGRESS PAYMENTS UNTIL THE PROBLEM IS CORRECTED THREE BEFORE THE FINAL PAYMENT IS MADE REQUIRING A SIGNED AFFIDAVIT UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY THAT THE SUBCONTRACTORS PROPERLY PAID THEIR WORKERS. THIS AMENDMENT TWO WHICH IS STANDARD PROCEDURE IN THE FORMAL- IN THE IN THE FORMAL CONSTRUCTION ECONOMY HAS MOVED ALMOST ALL OF THE CONTRACTORS ASSOCIATIONS FROM OPPOSED TO NEUTRAL IT IS A THOUGHTFUL PRACTICAL ELEMENT TO THIS LEGISLATION I ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. SENATOR BRADFORD. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB SEVENTY SIX IT'S A FAIR COMMONSENSE MEASURE THAT PROTECTS NOT ONLY THE WORKER BUT THOSE ARE HORRIBLE- CONTRACTORS WHO DO THEIR JOB AND ACCOUNT FOR THEIR SUB CONTRACTORS AND MAKING SURE THOSE EMPLOYEES ARE ARE PAID IN A TIMELY MANNER- IN INDIAN UNDERGROUND KHAN ACADEMY- THIS MEASURES SHOULD ONLY BE FEARFUL BY THOSE BAD OPERATORS WHO FAIL TO PAY THEIR WORKERS IN A RESPONSIBLE MANNER AND IT PUTS A LITTLE ONUS ON THOSE CONTRACTORS TO OVERSEE AND MAKE SURE. THAT THOSE WORKERS GET PAID ON THE STAIRWAY FOR ON THE STATE WORK AND IT GIVES THEM A LITTLE AND SENT PUTS A LITTLE SKIN IN THE GAME SO IF- THEY'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING THEY HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR BUT IF THEY'RE NOT THEY SHOULD BE HELD LIABLE SO I ASKED. FOR A VOTE ON SB SEVEN TWO SEVEN. ENTER AMBER. AND COLLEAGUES- I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB SEVEN TWENTY SEVEN I THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM CHINO FOR BEING FLEXIBLE IN WORKING WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS IN JUDICIARY COMMITTEE I THINK WE PRODUCED A GOOD PRODUCT IS STILL A LITTLE BIT OF WORK TO BE DONE BUT I THINK WE PRODUCED A GOOD PRODUCT JOINT SEVERAL LIABILITY IS A HEAVY HAMMER BUT IS APPROPRIATE WHEN WAGES ARE BEING STOLEN- I REGIONAL VOTE.

CIGARETTES CONTAIN A HARMFUL COMBINATION OF NICOTINE FLAVORING FLAVORING AND OTHER CHEMICALS ADDITIVES ALTHOUGH THEY ARE CURRENTLY TAXED AS OTHER TOBACCO PRODUCTS- OTP THE TAX RATE IS MUCH LOWER THAN THAT OF TRADITIONAL CIGARETTES THEREBY CONTRIBUTING TO THE GROWING DISPARITY BETWEEN THESE PRODUCTS AND UNDERMINING THE EFFORTS TO CURB VAPING.

SENATOR WIENER THE FLOOR'S YOURS. YOU MADAM PRESIDENT CALLING SENATE BILL THREE THIRTY NINE- THE GAS TAX ALTERNATIVE PLAN THAT WILL EXTEND THE EXISTING- ROAD CHARGE TECHNICAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE FROM TWENTY TWENTY THREE TO TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN.-ALLOW THIS PILOT PROGRAM- TO CONTINUE- THIS PILOT WHICH WAS CREATED BACK IN TWENTY FOURTEEN. AND IS ADMINISTERED BY THE- THE CALIFORNIA STATE TRANSPORTATION AGENCY AND THE CITY C. ALLOWS FOR THE STUDY OF AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE GAS TAX A ROAD USER CHARGE. OR CHARGE FOR DRIVERS BASED ON THE MILES THEY TRAVEL CURRENTLY THE GAS TAX THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE IN FUNDING CALIFORNIA STATE HIGHWAY SYSTEM OUR LOCAL ROADS. UNDER PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE. HOWEVER THE GAS TAX IS NOT A VIABLE LONG TERM SOLUTION FOR INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING. I DO TOO AND THIS IS A GOOD THING INCREASES AND VEHICLE- EFFICIENCY AND THE RISE OF ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES WE WANT THESE THINGS TO HAPPEN BUT THAT MEANS LESS USE OF GAS WHICH IS A GOOD THING BUT THAT MEANS LESS GAS TAX TO FUND OUR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM. TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM SO WE DON'T EXPERIENCE A CLIFF AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE. A FUNDING CLASS. SO THAT WE CAN FIND OUR TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE WE NEED TO PLAN FOR A TRANSITION AWAY FROM THE GAS TAX AND TOWARD A FORM OF A ROAD USER CHARGE. ON SP THREE THIRTY NINE DOES NOT REQUIRE ANYTHING NO ONE WILL BE REQUIRED TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS PILOT PROGRAM NO ONE WILL BE REQUIRED TO PAY- THE ROAD CHARGE AS PART OF THIS PILOT PROGRAM CITED PURELY VOLUNTARY. IT SIMPLY ALLOWS FOR FURTHER STUDY OF THIS CRUCIAL POLICY THROUGH A VOLUNTARY PROGRAM SO THAT PEOPLE CAN PARTICIPATE. ONLY IF THEY WANT TO. SP THREE THIRTY NINE ALL THE PIE IN A FEW WAYS. FIRST IT'LL FOR THE TO BE ACTUALLY. REVENUE FROM THE VOLUNTEER PARTICIPANTS. OF PREVIOUS VERSIONS USE MOCK INVOICES TO COLLECT A ROW CHARGED BUT THIS CHANGE WILL ALLOW THE CITY SEE TO TEST.

OR NEIGHBORHOOD PHARMACIST DISPENSED NEARLY 70% OF ALL PRESCRIPTIONS UNFORTUNATELY THEY ARE INCREASINGLY SADDLED WITH PROFIT DRIVEN SALES QUOTAS SUCH AS UP SELLING PATIENTS INTO AUTOMATIC REFILL PROGRAMS ARE FILLING A MINIMUM NUMBER OF PRESCRIPTIONS PER HOUR. AS WELL AS OTHER CORPORATE DIRECTOR OBJECTIVES WHICH NOT ONLY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE SAFE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE BUT CAN INTERFERE WITH THEIR ABILITY TO DO JUST THAT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROFESSIONAL POST THIS BILL ISN'T MERELY ABOUT PROTECTING PHARMACIST IT'S ABOUT PROTECTING THEIR PATIENTS AS WELL WHICH IS TO SAY ALL OF US. AND ALL OF OUR FAMILIES FROM THE MISTAKES THAT INEVITABLY ARISE FROM INATTENTION ENCASED IN A PHARMACY PHARMACISTS ARE THE LAST LINE OF DEFENSE AGAINST POTENTIALLY DEADLY DRUG INTERACTIONS AS THEY FILL PRESCRIPTIONS THEY MUST CONTACT PRESCRIBING PHYSICIANS VERIFY CORRECT DOSING CHECK FOR DRUG INTERACTIONS. AND ALLERGIC REACTIONS AND COUNSEL EDUCATE AND ANSWER PATIENT QUESTIONS ABOUT THE MEDICINE THEY PRESCRIBE. EACH YEAR NEARLY ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS ARE HARMED BY UNINFORMED OR IMPROPER USE OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS PHARMACY SALES QUOTAS AND THEIR DETRIMENTAL IMPACT ON PHARMACISTS HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH CNSCIENTIOUS PATIENT CARE AND EVERYTHING TO DO WITH CORPORATE PROFITS THE PHARMACIST LIKE DOCTORS MUST BE FREE TO PRACTICE MEDICINE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ETHICAL DICTATES OF THEIR PROFESSION. AS P. THREE SIX TWO IS A NECESSARY AND REASONABLE MEASURE TOWARD RESTORING THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF PATIENTS AS A TOP PRIORITY AND WILL ENSURE THE PHARMACIST WILL BE ABLE TO ADHERE TO THEIR- TO MAKE MEDICAL DECISIONS BASED CLEARLY AND SOLELY ON PATIENT NEEDS.

SENATOR SKINNER. RIGHT. LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE ASKING FOR IS THE MEMBERS- SOME OF US TO REALIZE THAT PHARMACISTS ALSO HAVE LIABILITY. IF THEY'RE- IF A PRESCRIPTION ORDERED BY DOCTOR IS IN CONFLICT WITH ANOTHER MEDICINE THAT PATIENT IS TAKING EVEN IF THE DOCTOR DID NOT PRESCRIBE THE OTHER MEDICINE SO PHARMACISTS HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF LIABILITY SO WE REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE JUST AS THE AUTHOR SPOKE. THAT THEY ARE PAYING PROPER ATTENTION AND LOOKING AT THE RECORDS OF WHAT- PRESCRIPTIONS THEY FILLED ANY OTHER MEDICINES POSSIBLY THAT THERE- CLIENT MAY BE TAKING AND EVEN ASKING QUESTIONS IF THEY KNOW THERE'S ADVERSE.

LAST WEEK I INTRODUCED SB ONE ZERO EIGHT THE HUMAN RIGHT TO FOOD ACT. S. B. FOUR SIX FOUR ADDRESS IS FEEDING THE RESIDENTS OF OUR STATE IT WORKS TO ENSURE THERE IS GREATER EQUITY IN CALIFORNIA'S FOOD ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. PRIOR TO THE COPA NINETEEN PANDEMIC. APPROXIMATELY ONE IN TEN CALIFORNIANS EXPERIENCE FOOD INSECURITY THE PANDEMIC AND RESULTING ECONOMIC CRISIS HAS EXACERBATED FOOD INSECURITY ACROSS THE STATE PARTICULARLY AMONG LOW WAGE. IMMIGRANTS AND THEIR FAMILIES. IT'S ESTIMATED THAT ONE IN FOUR UNDOCUMENTED HOUSEHOLDS ARE FOOD INSECURE. UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS DACA RECIPIENTS TEMPORARY PROTECTED STATUS HOLDERS AND CERTAIN VISA HOLDERS WERE DEEMED ESSENTIAL WORKERS DURING. THE PANDEMIC. UP AND THEY ALSO HAVE TO PROVIDE FOOD FOR THEIR OWN DINNER TABLES AND THE DINNER TABLES OF OTHERS AT THE RISK OF THEIR OWN LIVES. THE SAME WORKERS ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE FEDERAL CALFRESH AND OUR STATE FUNDED CALIFORNIA FOOD ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. THESE EXCLUSIONS HAVE FORCED IMMIGRANT HOUSEHOLDS TO MAKE IMPOSSIBLE CHOICES BETWEEN BUYING GROCERIES AND COVERING THE COST OF RENT OR OTHER BASIC NEEDS. THEY WORK IN THE SHADOWS AND SUFFER IN SILENCE. FOOD FOR ALL MEANS MORE THAN SOMEONE'S FOOD SECURITY STATUS AND FOOD SECURITY MEANS MUCH MORE THAN SOMEONE STATUS. PUT FOR ALL MEANS GOOD HEALTH WITHOUT HEALTHY FOODS CHILDREN'S PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH AS WELL AS ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT AND FUTURE PROSPERITY ARE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED. THE PANDEMIC HAS LAID BARE THE INEQUITIES AND INJUSTICES THAT ARE EMBEDDED THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AND SOCIETY. AS BEFORE SIX FOUR WILL HELP UNITES US BECAUSE FOOD UNITES US THIS IS NOT ABOUT IMMIGRATION STATUS OR US VERSUS THEM- MEANS OPPORTUNITIES SUCH AS THOSE MY PARENTS FOUND IN FOOD. IT'S ABOUT ENSURING THAT NO ONE GOES HUNGRY SP FOUR SIX FOUR MODERNIZES THE CALIFORNIA FOOD ASSISTANCE PROGRAM EXPANDING ELIGIBILITY FOR STATE FUNDED NUTRITION BENEFITS. TO ANYONE IN ELIGIBLE FOR CALFRESH TO SOLELY TO THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS IN DOING SO THE BILL PROVIDES GREATER FOOD SECURITY TO LOW INCOME IMMIGRANT WORKERS HELPING THEM LIVE. HELPING LIFT THE LEFT THEM OUT OF POVERTY AS CALFRESH IS PROVEN TO DO SO. THIS IS A BILL THAT IS BOTH GOOD FOR FARMERS AND FARM WORKERS. FOOD IS HEALTH FOOD IS LIFE FOOD IS A HUMAN RIGHT AND LET'S MAKE SURE CALIFORNIA IS A STATE WHERE FOOD IS FOR ALL. CAMILLA PARKER BOWLES I RESPECTFULLY ASK FRIEND ABOUT.

NOW FOR JUST NOW SENATOR HERTEL REMOVES A CALL. RIVERS ARE GOING TO MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER ONE TWELVE SENATOR MAN IS PREPARED PLEASE READ. CENTER I'M IF YOU JUST HOLD ON A SECOND- READ READ THE BILL. SENATE BILL FOUR SEVENTY SIX BY SENATOR MAN AN ACT RELATING TO THE PACE PROGRAM CENTER BIN MEN THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. AMBER'S SP FOUR SEVENTY SIX ESTABLISHES TWO CRITICAL REFORMS THAT HELP ADDRESS SOME OF THE MOST COMMON CONSUMER ABUSES WE CONTINUE TO SEE IN THE PACE PROGRAM. WITH RESPECT TO THE SOLICITATION AND FINANCING ASPECTS. FIRST THE BILL REQUIRES A QUALIFIED THIRD PARTY TO PERFORM AN ENERGY AUDIT. TO ENSURE THE HOME IMPROVEMENTS WILL REDUCE ENERGY CONSUMPTION OR FOSSIL FUELS USE. A SOLICITOR'S OFTEN PROVIDE UNREALISTIC ESTIMATES ABOUT HOW MUCH MONEY HOMEOWNERS WILL SAVE IN ENERGY COSTS. CONSUMERS ARE PROMISED ENERGY SAVINGS THAT MAY NEVER MATERIALIZE AND PITCHED UPGRADES THEY MAY NOT NEED. AS BEFORE SEVENTY SIX WAS AMENDED TO ADDRESS CONCERNS RAISED BY THE SENATE BANKING COMMITTEE AND OPPOSITION RELATED TO THE OPPOSITE RELATING TO THE AUDIT PROVISIONS SPECIFICALLY RECENT AMENDMENTS CLARIFY WHO CAN CONDUCT THE REQUIRED ENERGY AUDIT. AND EXPAND THE NUMBER OF QUALIFIED AUDITORS TO ADDRESS CONCERNS AROUND THAT. THEY ALSO NARROW THE SCOPE OF THE ENERGY AUDIT BY REQUIRING ONLY BECAME HOME IMPROVEMENTS THAT ARE BEING MADE TO BE ASSESSED FOR SUITABILITY- THEY WAIVE THE AUDIT FOR EMERGENCY HOME IMPROVEMENTS. THE SECOND IMPORTANT REFORM THE SP FOUR SEVENTY SIX MAKES IS HALTING PAYMENTS TO A CASE CONTRACTOR UNTIL A PROGRAM ADMINISTRATOR HAS OBTAINED COPIES OF PERMITS FOR FINAL INSPECTIONS TO VERIFY THAT ALL WORK HAS BEEN ADEQUATELY PERFORMED. RESIDENTIAL CASE HAS A HISTORY OF CONSUMER COMPLAINTSREGARDING UNFINISHED OR UNACCEPTABLE WORK AND IMPROVEMENTS THE CONTRACTORS HAVE CHARGE FOR BUT NEVER INSTALLED. HAVING A COMBINATION OF AN UPFRONT ENERGY AUDIT AND A BACK AN INSPECTION ARE MODEST IMPROVEMENTS OR CHANGES THE% PROGRAMS THAT WILL SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE PAY FRAUD IN THE PACE PROGRAM. AS BEFORE SEVENTY SIX IS SUPPORTED BY A WIDE COALITION OF CONSUMER ADVOCATES BANKS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND HOUSING ADVOCATES AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD AS WE HAVE CONTINUED TO MENACE MY OFFICE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS IN TRYING TO MAKE THIS THE BEST DEAL POSSIBLE.

SENATE BILL FIVE OH THREE BY SENATOR BACKER AND ACTUALLY DEVOTING CENTER BECAUSE THE FLOOR IS YOURS THE MORNING MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS. SP FIVE WITH THREE IS ALL ABOUT TRANSPARENCY INCREASING CORPORATE COMMUNICATIONS WITH VOTERS BETTER DATA AND CODIFYING WHAT WE KNOW WORKS FROM THE NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ELECTION. CALIFORNIA'S LIKE TO VOTE FOR HOME FROM HOME WE'VE SEEN INCREASING PERCENTAGES. BUT PRIOR TO THE NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ELECTION THERE WERE NO CLEAR STATEWIDE STANDARDS FOR EVALUATING SIGNATURES. WHEN YOU'RE GO STANFORD LAW STUDENTS IDENTIFIED SIGNATURE DISPARITIES FROM COUNTY TO COUNTY IN FACT THE NUMBER PROJECTED MAIL IN BALLOTS SURPASSED ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND. IN THE MARCH TWENTY TWENTY PRIMARY ALONE. SB FIVE A THREE IN SHORT THE COUNTIES ACROSS THE STATE ARE USING THE SAME UNIFORM PRACTICES FOR SIGNATURE SUSSMAN. AND REPORTING REJECTIONS. JOHN SIGNATURES DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT THE MOST FORMAL CALIFORNIANS THOSE WITH LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENCY DISABILITIES FIRST TIME AGING VOTERS AND VOTERS OF COLOR. THIS ACT ALSO INCREASES COMMUNICATION BEYOND THE SIMPLE LETTER TODAY ALLOWING EMAIL AND PHONE CALLS TO VOTERS WHOSE SIGNATURES ARE CHALLENGED.

FROM BOTH THE END NETWORK AND OUT OF NETWORK PROVIDERS DURING THE FEDERAL PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. THESE PROTECTIONS REMAIN FOR IN NETWORK TESTING IN VACCINES FOLLOWING THE PUBLIC FEDERAL PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. THIS BILL ALSO PROHIBITS BALANCE BILLING BY PROVIDERS FOR COVER NINETEEN TESTING STATIONS EVEN AFTER THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY EXPIRES. WE CAN ALREADY TAKE LESSONS LEARNED FROM THIS PANDEMIC PUT A FRAMEWORK IN PLACE TO ALLOW FEDERALLY APPROVED TESTING AND IMMUNIZATIONS WITH NO COST SHARING FOR FUTURE PANDEMICS WELL WE HAVE MADE TREMENDOUS PROGRESS AND WE ARE STILL WORKING TOWARD THE MAJORITY ACTUALLY BORN MAJORITY POPULATION BEING VACCINATED- THE GENERAL FOCUS PRIORITIES ENSURING THAT EVERYONE CAN GET A VACCINE.

NO CENTER CAN MOVE THE CALL EVEN UNDER ONE EIGHTEEN SENATOR WIENER IS PREPARED PLEASE READ. SENATE BILL FIVE NINETEEN BY SENATOR WIENER AN ACT RELATING TO CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES CENTER WINNER THE FORAGERS. I THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT CALLERS ARRIVED TODAY TO PRESENT SENATE BILL FIVE NINETEEN- WHICH WOULD DECRIMINALIZE THE POSSESSION AND PERSONAL USE OF CERTAIN PSYCHEDELIC SUBSTANCES TO ENCOURAGE SAFER USE THIS BILL ALSO DECRIMINALIZE DRUG TESTING KITS AND PERMITS THE POSSESSION OF PARAPHERNALIA TO USE THESE SUBSTANCES ARE SAFE WAY. SP FIVE NINETY WILL ALSO CONVENE AN EXPERT WORKING GROUP UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH THAT WILL DEVELOP RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE LEGISLATURE ABOUT HOW CALIFORNIA CAN REGULATE LEGAL ACCESS TO THESE SUBSTANCES. IN A MANNER THAT IS SAFE RESPONSIBLE AND EQUITABLE. THIS APPROACH MOVES US AWAY FROM THE FAILED WAR ON DRUGS WHICH- WAS BASED ON THE FLAWED. BADLY FLAWED PREMISE THAT CRIMINALIZING ARRESTING PROSECUTORS PROSECUTING AND IMPRISONING PEOPLE FOR USING DRUGS WILL SOMEHOW DETER THEIR USE AND WILL SOMEHOW IMPROVE PUBLIC SAFETY. THERE'S ANYTHING WE'VE LEARNED FROM THE PAST HALF CENTURY IS THAT THROWING PEOPLE IN JAIL FOR USING DRUGS DOESN'T STOP DRUG USE IT ON THESE TOPIC DICTION. IT DOESN'T STOP. ANY OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO ADDRESS WITH THE WAR ON DRUGS IT HAS BEEN A COMPLETE FAILURE. COGS IN BRINGING SENATE BILL FIVE NINETY BEFORE YOU TODAY BECAUSE WE NEED TO CHANGE OUR APPROACH ON A RESPONSE TO SUBSTANCE USE INSTEAD OF MAKING IT WORSE. IN RECENTYEARS VARIOUS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE DECRIMINALIZED THE POSSESSION AND PERSONAL USE OF PSYCHEDELICS INCLUDING SANTA CRUZ IN OAKLAND. AS WELL AS WASHINGTON DC AND SOMERVILLE MASSACHUSETTS THIS PAST NOVEMBER OREGON VOTERS PASSED TO BELLINGER SERVICE ONE TO DECRIMINALIZE PERSONAL USE OF ALL SUBSTANCES. AND ANOTHER FOCUSED ON- SIX PSILOCYBIN ASSISTED THERAPY PROGRAMS. OTHER COUNTRIES SUCH AS PORTUGAL HAVE ALSO SUCCESSFULLY MOVED IN THIS DIRECTION. THE BUILDER FOR YOU TODAY. DOES NOT PROPOSE TO DECRIMINALIZE ALL SUBSTANCES IT FOCUSES ON PSYCHEDELIC SUBSTANCES. AND COLLEAGUES AS THOSE OF YOU WHO AND I WANT TOTHANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO LOOK AT THIS BILL. THERE IS GROWING AND POWERFUL EVIDENCE THAT PSYCHEDELIC DRUGS. ARE EXTREMELY HELPFUL AND COULD HELP SAVE PEOPLE'S LIVES WHO ARE SUFFERING FROM MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION CHALLENGES. VETERANS ARE PARENTS CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR CHILDREN PEOPLE WHO HAVE PTSD AFTER COMING BACK TO THIS COUNTRY AFTER FIGHTING FOR OUR COUNTRY. PEOPLE WHO ARE ADDICTED TO HEROIN. WITH THESE SUBSTANCES HAVE CHANGED THEIR LIVES. HAVE BEEN ABLE TO HELP THEM STOP USING DRUGS. VETERANS SUFFERING FROM PTSD AND DEPRESSION WHO'VE BEEN ABLE TO TURN THEIR LIVES AROUND. AND RIGHT NOW WE ARE FORCING THESE COMBAT VETERANS WHO WENT TO FIGHT FOR OUR COUNTRY WE'RE FORCING THEM TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY TO GET TREATMENT THAT WILL TURN THEIR LIVES AROUND. WE SHOULD NOT BE DOING THAT IT'S SHAMEFUL. LET'S STOP ARRESTING AND PROSECUTING PEOPLE FOR POSSESSING AND USING THESE DRUGS LET'S TAKE A SCIENCE AND HEALTH BASICALLY BASED APPROACH. INSTEAD OF A CRIMINALIZATION APPROACH WHEN IT COMES TO DRUG USE COLLEAGUES I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN IPO. SENATOR MELINDA THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN- I RISE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL AND I WILL TELL YOU AS A VETERAN MYSELF AS SOMEONE MARRIED TO A VETERAN AS SOMEONE WHO'S HAD A PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH A FAMILY MEMBER WHO IS SUFFERING FROM PTSD I TAKE ISSUE WITH THIS BILL BEING PROPPED UP AS SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO HELP VETERANS THIS BILL PROPOSES TO LEGALIZE A NUMBER OF DRUGS ON THE AUTHOR MENTIONS PSYCHEDELICS BUT ONE IN PARTICULAR THERE'S A GREAT CONCERN TO ME. IS CARRYING. THIS BILL PROPOSES TO MAKE CAN MEAN LEGAL FOR RECREATIONAL PURPOSES CAN I MEAN AS A DATE RAPE DRUG. I DON'T KNOW WHY IN THE WORLD WE WOULD BE CONTEMPLATING. LEGALIZING A DRUG. LIKE CAN I MEAN USED TO INCAPACITATE YOUNG WOMEN AND GIRLS FOR THE PURPOSES OF RAPING THEM. AND KEEP IN MIND THAT 61% ROUGHLY. OF RAPES BY AN ACQUAINTANCE PERHAPS SOMEONE AT YOUR COLLEGE AT A PARTY THAT YOU ATTENDED THAT YOU'VE SEEN A FEW TIMES 61% OF THOSE TYPES OF RAPES ARE NEVER REPORTED. ROUGHLY HALF. OF THOSE DONE BY A BOYFRIEND OR SOMETHING OF THAT NATURE ARE NOT REPORTED SO. SOMEONE MIGHT SUGGEST THAT. THIS BILL ISN'T INTENDED TO ALLOW ACTIVITY LIKE THAT AND I'M SURE IT'S NOT. BUT FOR EVERY ONE PERSON YOU MAY CATCH USING THIS DRUG FOR THAT SPECIFIC PURPOSE OF RAPING SOMEONE FOR EVERYONE PERSON YOU CATCH DOING THAT I GUARANTEE YOU THERE'S AT LEAST TEN MORE YOU WILL NEVER CATCH. BECAUSE IT'S HARD. TO FIGURE OUT WHO DID THAT TO NOW YOU GONNA TAKE A BILL TO MAKE HAVING CANNOT MEAN LEGAL FIGURED ANY COLLEGE PARTY OR ANY BAR FOR THAT MATTER. AND YOU HAVE IT IN YOUR POCKET. NO ONE CAN DO ANYTHING TO YOU THEY CAN ASK YOU WHAT YOU INTEND TO DO IT HEN YOU CAN SAY I KNOW I JUST. IT'S FOR MYSELF AND THEN LATER ON. YOU DROP IT IN SOMEONE'S DRINK. A YOUNG WOMAN IS RAPED AND SHE HAS NO IDEA WHO DID IT HAT COULD BE YOUR DAUGHTER. OR YOUR GRANDDAUGHTER. FOR YOUR NIECE OR NEPHEW FRANKLY. I DON'T DISPUTE. THAT CAN MEAN- HAS POTENTIAL. THEY HAVE BEEN DOING TRIALS BUT PLEASE REMEMBER. THEY CAN I MEAN THAT IS BEING USED TO TREAT VETERANS WITH PTSD OR THOSE WITH DEPRESSION. IS BEING DONE IN A CLINICAL SETTING IT IS NOT RECREATIONAL USE IT IS TYPICALLY GIVEN EITHER THROUGH AN IV OR THROUGH A NASAL MIST WHICH IS A PRESCRIPTION. IT'S NOT A PELL. AND IS DONE IN A VERY CONTROLLED MEDICAL SETTING IN A DOCTOR'S OFFICE AND IT IS SHOWING POTENTIAL. THE FDA HAS APPROVED IT WE STILL DON'T KNOW IT COULD PROVE TO BE HELPFUL BUT NOT IN THE WAY THAT THIS PROBE THIS BILL PROPOSES FOR IT TO BE YEARS SO I JUST WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT THE SAFETY. OF THE YOUNG WOMEN AND GIRLS WHO MAY FALL VICTIM TO SOMEONE WHO TAKES ADVANTAGE OF A LOT LIKE THIS BEING PASSED. IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU'RE AGAINST HELPING PEOPLE WHO ARE SUFFERING FROM DEPRESSION BUT I THINK THERE'S A BETTER WAY WE CAN CRAFT POLICY TO HELP PEOPLE LIKE THIS WITHOUT ALSO ENDANGERING. THE LIVES OF UNSUSPECTING VICTIMS THANK YOU AND I ASK FOR YOUR NUMBER. SENATOR LEYVA. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT OF WIND THE SENATOR FROM THE SAN FRANCISCO FIRST ASKED ME ABOUT HIS- BILL I SAID NO I SAID I DIDN'T THINK I COULD SUPPORT THIS BILL AND THEN AFTER READING AND RESEARCHING AND MEETING WITH THE VETERANS GROUPS THAT I MET WITH- ONE IN PARTICULAR STANDS OUT I MET WITH A COMBAT VETERAN A NAVY SEAL AND AN ARMY RANGER ALL OF THEM WHO SAW THINGS THAT NONE OF US HAVE SEEN AND NONE OF US PROBABLY NEED TO SEE. THE THINGS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN LIVE THE LIVES THAT WE CHOOSE TO LIVE AND I ASKED THEM I SAID TELL ME WHY THIS IS SO IMPORTANT TO YOU TELL E WHY THIS IS HELPING YOU AND THEY EXPLAINED TO ME THAT EVERYTHING THAT THEY HAD TRIED BEFORE EVERYTHING THAT THEY HAD BEEN PRESCRIBED BEFORE SOME OF THEM WERE TAKING THIRTEEN OF FOURTEEN PRESCRIPTIVE DRUGS PER DAY AND IT WASN'T HELPING THEY TALK TO ME ABOUT MICRO DOSING THEY TALKED TO ME ABOUT HOW THEY USE THIS AND HOW IT'S BEEN LIFE CHANGING FOR THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES. THEY HAVE STARTED OTHER GROUPS TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR VETERANS HAVE ACCESS TO THIS FOR MEMBERS I I'M A CREATURE OF HABIT SOMETIMES I HEAR THINGS AND I THINK OH NO THIS ISN'T THE WAY WE'VE EVER DONE IT BEFORE BUT WE KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING TO HELP OUR VETERANS IS NOT WORKING SO WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING AND TRY SOMETHING DIFFERENT. AND I UNDERSTAND WHERE THE SENATOR FROM ELSINORE IS COMING FROM ANYONE WHO KNOWS ME IN MY SEVEN YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN HERE I HAVE DONE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WORK ON WOMEN'S ISSUES SPECIFICALLY AROUND RAPE AND YES CAN I MEAN HAS BEEN USED AS A DATE RAPE DRUG BUT I'M NOT SURE IF YOU'RE AWARE THAT THE NUMBER ONE DATE RAPE DRUG IS ALCOHOL SO UNTIL WE FIND A WAY AROUND THAT I THINK THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THAT ISSUE AS WELL AND IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT RAPE I THINK IT'S A DIFFERENT SUBJECT AND TALKING ABOUT. HOW WE CAN FIX THAT SITUATION BUT MEMBERS I WOULD ASK YOU. TO THINK A LITTLE BIT OUTSIDE YOUR COMFORT ZONE. THINK ABOUT THESE. MEN AND WOMEN WHO HAVE SERVED OUR COUNTRY. AND THIS MIGHT BE A SMALL STEP IN HELPING THEM TO REGAIN THEIR LIVES AS THEY HAVE FOUGHT TO MAKE SURE WE CAN LIVE OUR LIVES I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND I HAVE A- SENATOR BURGESS. I THINK DECRIMINALIZATION LAW. IS TIED TO THE RECORD SHOULD BE TIED TO THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF PERSONS MOST KNOWLEDGEABLE IN THIS BILL CURRENTLY PROPOSES THE CREATION OF A TASK FORCE. I WOULD FEEL FAR MORE COMFORTABLE EVALUATING THE MERITS. OF POTENTIAL DECRIMINALIZATION IF THERE WAS A TASK FORCE THAT. I HAD ALREADY BEEN FORMED IN PUT FORWARD THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS. SO I THINK THIS I SLIGHTLY YOU KNOW THE CART BEFORE THE HORSE SCENARIO AND I THINK BECAUSE OF THAT WE WOULD BE BETTER SERVED AS A MATTER OF POLICY AND PROCEDURE. TO LISTEN TO FOLKS PRIOR TO MAKING A DEAL CRIMINALIZATION BILL. THE SECOND ISSUE I THINK I HAVE WITH THIS IS THE SOCIAL SHARING. NOW WE'VE HEARD FROM- FROM FOLKS WHO ARE KNOWLEDGEABLE ON. HOW THIS COULD BE BENEFICIAL- TO FOLKS OF SUFFERING FROM POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER. BUT CAN'T THAT TYPE OF TREATMENT BE ACHIEVED THROUGH CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE- A PRESCRIPTION. BUY IN NOT THE DECRIMINALIZATION OF THAT. BUT THE IDEA OF SOCIAL SHARING GOES AGAINST THAT NOTION THAT YOU SHOULD BE SURGICAL IN TARGETED TO THOSE MOST NEEDING AT THAT SOCIAL SHARING COMPONENT TURNS THIS INTO A RECREATIONAL DECRIMINALIZATION. SO I THINK FOR THOSE TWO REASONS- I WON'T BE IN A POSITION TO SUPPORT THIS AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE THE AUTHOR WHO. DOES GREAT HOMEWORK ON HIS BILLS THAT MAYBE SOMETHING LIKE THIS COME BACK AFTER TASK FORCES CREATED SO WE COULD HEAR WHAT THOSE PROFESSIONALS ARE TRULY RECOMMENDING RATHER THAN DOING IT IN THE REVERSE. SENATOR NEWMAN. THANK YOU MATCHER I'D LIKE TO LINE MY SELF WITH MY WITH THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM CHINO YEAH I RISE AS A PROUD THAT AND I ASSUME SEEMINGLY UNLIKELY. CO AUTHOR OF SP FIVE NINETEEN. BASED UPON MY DISCUSSIONS WITH THE AUTHOR AN EXAMINATION THE MOST RECENT RESEARCH. AND ALSO A CONSULTATION WITH BETTER NOW BECAUSE I'VE BEEN PERSUADED THAT THE PSYCHEDELIC THE PSYCHEDELIC THERAPIES OFFER POTENTIALLY BREAKTHROUGH BENEFITS TO CALIFORNIA'S VETERANS AND OTHERS SUFFERING FROM POST TRAUMATIC STRESS. PSYCHEDELIC THERAPY HAS RECENTLY BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO BE A PROMISING APPROACH FOR MANY VETERANS WHO ARE STRUGGLING WITH PERSISTENT TREATMENT RESISTANT CHALLENGES CAUSED BY BATTLEFIELD TRAUMA AND LIFE CHANGING INJURIES. CURRENTLY INDIVIDUALS SUFFERING FROM POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS TEND TO RESPOND POSITIVELY TO CONVENTIONAL THERAPIES ONLY ABOUT 50% OF THE TIME AT BEST WHETHER THAT'S THROUGH PSYCHOLOGICAL COUNSELING OR MEDICATIONS. OR SOME COMBINATION THEREOF HAVE IS OF COURSE BETTER THAN NOTHING- BUT ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE WHO ADORE TRAUMA. IN THEIR SERVICE TO OUR NATION NEARLY HALF IS STILL CLEARLY INSUFFICIENT. IN RECENT YEARS VETERAN SUICIDE RATES HAVE STEADILY RISEN AS THE MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS IN THIS COUNTRY HAS CONTINUED TO WORSEN AT THIS POINT MANY VETERANS OF OUR MOST RECENT WARS. HAVE ACTUALLY LOST MORE OF THEIR FELLOW SERVICE MEMBERS TO SUICIDE IN TWO DEPLOYMENTS WITH FAIRLY CLEAR AT THIS POINT THE CONVENTIONAL APPROACHES TO THE MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT OF OUR VETS. ARE NOT SATISFACTORY AND REQUIRES SOME LEVEL OF INNOVATION CREATIVITY AND OPEN MINDEDNESS I'M SUPPORTING SP FIVE NINETEEN BECAUSE MANY OF OUR NATION'S MOST ACCOMPLISHED RESEARCHERS ARE ENCOURAGED AS A RESULT OF EVIDENCE BASED RESEARCH. BY THE POTENTIALLY BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF MDMA AND OTHER PSYCHOTROPIC SUBSTANCES WHEN COMBINED WITH STRUCTURED THERAPY PROGRAMS TO ALLEVIATE THE PAIN AND SUFFERING OF MILITARY VETERANS AND OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE SUFFERING FROM THE EFFECTS OF POST TRAUMATIC STRESS. I'M ALSO SUPPORTING SP FIVE NINETEEN BECAUSE THE BILL OFFERS NEW HOPE TO OUR MILITARY VETERANS AND THEIR FAMILIES AND THEIR FRIENDS. AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO MANSION UNFORTUNATELY AT THE MOMENT ACCESS TO THESE PROMISING EMERGING THERAPIES ARE CURRENTLY ONLY LEGALLY AVAILABLE OUTSIDE. THE UNITED STATES THIS FORCES MILITARY PTSD SUFFERERS SUFFERERS MANY OF WHO HAVE TRIED FOR EVERYTHING. AND FIND THEMSELVES ON THE VERGE OF GETTING UP TO LEAVE THE U. S. AND PAY FOR THE COSTS OF TRAVEL AND LIVING ABROAD. IN AN UNFAMILIAR FOLK CULTURE SIMPLY TO RECEIVE AID AND COMFORT THAT THEY TRULY DESERVE. WIN CALIFORNIA'S WE'VE CONSISTENTLY DONE MUST CONTINUE TO PROVIDE LEADERSHIP AND INNOVATION IN OUR APPROACH IS PROVIDING EFFECTIVE REMEDIES FOR THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO SACRIFICE THEIR SAFETY AND THEIR WELL BEING. IN SERVICE TO THE REST OF US I URGE YOU TO JOIN ME IN SUPPORTING THIS LEGISLATION. AS A VETERAN AND ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA'S VETERANS I RESPECTFULLY URGE- I VOTE TODAY. SENATOR BATES. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I MUST RISE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL OUT OF PERSONAL EXPERIENCE OF MANY DECADES AGO AND PERHAPS SOME OF YOU WHERE WE'RE MAYBE NOT EVEN ON THE PLANET YEAH BUT I WAS A SOCIAL CASE WORKER IN INTAKE SUPERVISOR IN THE SIXTIES AND SEVENTIES AT THE TIME THAT LSD BECAME OUT OF THE GO TO DRUG FOR SOCIAL SHARING I THINK YOU MIGHT REMEMBER THE NAME TIMOTHY LEARY WHO WAS CONSIDERED THE GURU OF BEING ABLE TO. TAKE THIS SPECIFIC DRUG LSD AND FIND YOURSELF IN ANOTHER WORLD OUT OF BODY EXPERIENCES WELL MY CASELOAD AT THAT TIME- CONTINUED THE NUMBER% OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO HAD TRIED TO- THAT EXPERIMENT THROUGH SOCIAL SHARING I BRING FORWARD AND IT WERE NOT ABLE TO RETURN TO THEIR BODY OR FROM THAT OTHER WORLD THAT THEY FOUND THROUGH THAT JOB SO THEY BECAME A- TOTALLY INCAPACITATED OF MY CASELOAD WITH AID TO THE DISABLED AT THAT TIME AND I HAD A NUMBER OF THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE PRACTICALLY MY AGE AT THAT TIME- BASICALLY HAD. NO FURTHER ON CAPACITY AND FOUND THEMSELVES IN ASSISTED LIVING OR WHAT WAS AVAILABLE FOR PEOPLE IN THAT AGE AT THAT TIME SO THE SOCIAL SHARING PART OF THIS DRUG IS VERY VERY CONCERNING AND I THINK WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT PSYCHEDELIC EXPERIENCES THAT WILL GO ON AT PARTIES SOCIAL SHARING R. AS COMPARED TO A THERAPEUTIC USE FOR OUR VETERANS THEY'RE QUITE DIFFERENT AND SHOULDN'T I DON'T BELIEVE BE CONTAINED IN A MEASURE LIKE THIS. IF WE WANT TO CONFINE IT. SPECIFY IT POURS THROUGH. USE OUR BAD. ARE I TA SUPPORT THAT BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT THIS STEP SWAY OVER THAT IN IN PROMOTING SOCIAL SHARING. OF THESE VERY VERY SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTFUL DRUGS AND YOU NEED ONLY GO TO THE SCIENCE OF THAT IS AVAILABLE TO SHOW WHAT. THE IMPACTS OF PSYCHEDELIC DRUGS ARE FINE AND CERTAINLY VERY YOUNG MINDS IN OFF HOPEFULLY IN TERMS OF THOSE WHO ARE. SUFFERING BOB PTSD IN THOSE. PARTICULAR CONDITIONS IT'S QUITE A DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE ARE BASED ON FINANCE SO IT NEEDS TO BE SEPARATED AND I THINK MOST IMPORTANTLY THE CART BEFORE THE HORSE HERE. WE SHOULD HAVE THE RESULTS OF THE TASK FORCE OF THE STUDIES ARE DONE BEFORE WE TAKE THIS STEP SO I URGE YOU KNOW VOTE. SENATOR PENN. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT- SENATORS- I CAN RISE IN SUPPORT OF- THIS BILL HAS TO BE FIVE NINETEEN AND- THIS BILL WAS- HEARD AND- HEALTH COMMITTEE- THESE ARE- MEDICATIONS THAT ARE SHOWING CONSIDERABLE PROMISE AND EVEN MORE THAN PROMISE AND HELPING TREAT- SIGNIFICANT. MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES INCLUDING- POST MAX STRESS DISORDER AND DEPRESSION- AND BECAUSE OF CURRENT LAW WE ACTUALLY TELL PEOPLE IF YOU ACTUALLY HAVE IT ON YOU- YOU ARE BREAKING THE LAW WHICH THEN FORCES PEOPLE THEY HAVE TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY IN ORDER TO GET TREATMENT- I THINK OUR- SO. I THINK BOTH ARE VETERANS OR ANYONE ELSE WHO SUFFERS FROM PTSD AND DESERVES BETTER AND SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO THESE MEDICATIONS- AND SO WITH THAT HIGH- CAN I VOTE ON THIS BILL THANK YOU. SENATOR MELINDA'S. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I JUST HAVE A FEW MORE- THINGS TO ADD M. A. N. YOU KNOW TO SAY THAT A PARTICULAR DRUG SHOWS PROMISE. PROBABLY SOUNDS ENCOURAGING TOO MANY. BUT IS IT GOOD POLICY TO MAKE THE DRUG LEGAL FOR RECREATIONAL PURPOSES ONE THAT YOU HAVE DECIDED JUST SHOWS PROMISE. IS THAT SAFE POLICY TO PUT INTO PLACE. VETERANS RIGHT NOW IF THAT'S REALLY WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT. VETERANS RIGHT NOW HAVE ACCESS TO CARE TO MEAN THERAPY. WHAT THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO IS OVER MEDICATING THEMSELVES WHICH WE KNOW IS COMMON IN THOSE WHO SUFFER FROM DEPRESSION AND SEVERE PTSD THEY WERE THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW THEM TO OVER MEDICATE. THEMSELVES WITH A JOB LIKE THIS AND I THINK THAT'S THE EXACT OPPOSITE EFFECT THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR WE WANT THOSE WHO HAVE SEVERE DEPRESSION. AND OTHER TRAUMA TO BE ABLE TO GET BETTER WELL YOU CAN'T GET BETTER IF YOU ARE OVER MEDICATING YOURSELF. THIS IS AGAIN A SIGN FROM THE POINT THAT I MADE THAT YOU ARE PUTTING YOUNG WOMEN AND YOUNG GIRLS AT GREAT RISK. BY MAKING A DRUG LIKE THIS. LEGAL FOR RECREATIONAL PURPOSES NOT THERAPEUTIC. PURPOSES RECREATIONAL PURPOSES. SENATOR KAMMERER. THANK YOU MADAM. CHAIR I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB FIVE NINETEEN- AND JUST WANT TO REMIND FOLKS THAT YOU KNOW PSYCHEDELICS HAVE PLAYED A ROLE IN SO MANY CULTURES SINCE PRE HISTORY- THEY HELP THOSE WITH MENTAL ILLNESSES WITH DEPRESSION WITH ANXIETY WITH PTSD- AND THEY'VE ALSO HELPED HEALTHY PEOPLE TO. THEY OFFER NOT ONLY THERAPEUTIC BUT SPIRITUAL AND CREATIVE BENEFITS AS WELL. AS THE AUTHOR OF THIS BILL MENTIONED- THEY WERE. CRIMINALIZED AND IN FACT USED- AS A POLITICAL TOOL. IN FACT IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR AND NIXON AIDE ADMITTED. THAT THE WAR ON DRUGS WAS A POLITICAL TOOL DESIGNED TO TARGET. BLACKS AND THOSE PROTESTING THE VIETNAM WAR. AND SAID THAT SINCE YOU COULD NOT MAKE BEING BLACK OR BEING A HIPPIE LEGAL. THEN YOU COULD MAKE THE DRUGS THAT THEY TOOK THE LEGAL. AS A RESULT THE TRIALS THAT WERE GOING ON IN THE FIFTIES AND THE SIXTIES ACTUALLY STOPPED BECAUSE OF. THIS MANUFACTURED WAR ON DRUGS. I THINK THIS BILL IS ABOUT PUBLIC HEALTH. RESEARCH AGGRESSIVE RESEARCH HAS STARTED BACK UP AGAIN. WHICH DOES SHOW. THAT THERE IS PROMISE FOR TREATMENT USING THESE DRUGS AND AVALON AS WE HAVE SEEN JUST WITH LAST YEAR I THINK MANY OF US ARE MANY FOLKS MANY AMERICANS ACTUALLY- PUTTHEIR FAITH IN THE PROMISE. OF A VACCINE. THAT IS MEDICATION. THAT DID NOT GO THROUGH WHAT THE NORMAL LONGER CHANNELS OF RESEARCH AND TESTING WOULD REQUIRE. BECAUSE THEY SHOWED ENOUGH PROMISE TO ACCELERATE. I JUST WANT TO ALSO ADD THAT YOU KNOW. GREAT BUSY LEGAL NO MATTER IF YOU ARE USING DRUGS SOME KIND OF. SUBSTANCE OR FORCE. AND THIS IS NOT ABOUT DECRIMINALIZING ERRANT BEHAVIOR. IT'S ABOUT DECRIMINALIZING THE USE OF CERTAIN PSYCHEDELICS. THAT HAVE BEEN PROVEN TO BE USEFUL. FOR MANY FOLKS WHO NEED THEM. AND THIS ALSO SHOULD NOT BE ABOUT JUDGMENT OFTEN TIMES WE WANT TO PLACE OUR OWN PERSONAL JUDGMENT OR OUR OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCES. ON TO OTHER FOLKS WITHOUT REALLY UNDERSTANDING THEIR OWN MENTAL HEALTH. THEIR MEDICAL NEEDS. AND THEIR ABILITY TO HAVE CONTROL OVER THEIR BODIES AND THE MEDICAL DECISIONS THAT THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO MAKE AND I WOULD HOPE THAT WE WOULD THINK ABOUT THIS. IN THE SPACE OF PUBLIC HEALTH. RATHER THAN IN THE SPACE OF CRIMINALIZATION AND ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT ON SP FIVE NINETEEN. SEEING NO FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. SENATOR WIENER YOU MAY CONCLUDE- I AM I'M SORRY SENATOR CHILEAN. HI PAULA THANK YOU MADAM. SHE'S VERY THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. AND I HOPE TODAY. BECAUSE WE JUST HAD MEMORIAL DAY I AM A VETERAN I'M A COMBAT VETERAN I'VE SERVED AS THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY COMMISSIONER OF MILITARY VETERAN'S AFFAIRS FOR TWENTY FOUR YEARS. YOU TELL ME WHO'S DONE THAT. YOU TELL ME WHO SAT DOWN WITH FAMILY AFTER FAMILY AND VETERAN AFTER VETERAN AND HELD THEM AND AS THEY CRIED. SAID WHAT CAN I POSSIBLY DO WITH MY SON HE'S DRINKING. HIS BIGNESS WIFE HE'S DOING THIS HE'S DOING THAT AND WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO PICK UP THE PHONE AND GET. THE VETERANS REPRESENTATIVE THE SOCIAL WORKERS THE SOCIAL WORKERS WHO WORK WITH THE VA TO SET UP THE APPOINTMENT TO GET HIM INTO THE VA SYSTEM AND ONCE THEY GOT INTO THE VA SYSTEM ONCE THEY WENT TO THE EAST LA VET CENTER. WELL WE'VE HAD NOTHING BUT SUCCESS THERE GOD BLESS THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND SO NOW I KNOW ONE THING THAT. MY QUESTION IS WHERE ARE THEY GOING TO GET THIS L. AS THE DRUG THEY HAD TO GET IN THE ALLEY ON A SATURDAY NIGHT ARE THEY GOING TO GO DOWN TO THE CORNER. COMPTON WATTS WHERE ARE THEY GOING TO GET THIS DRUG BUT WHEREVER THEY GET IT I'LL BET YOU TWO DOLLARS TO DONUTS THEY'RE GONNA BE GETTING ADDITIONAL DRUG ADDITIONAL DRUGS WHY BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO BE SELF MEDICATING THEMSELVES. THEY DON'T NO ONE FROM THE OTHER THEY'RE GONNA EXPERIMENT. L. S. D. IS NOT A GOOD THING AND IF IT IS THEN LET'S DO THE RESEARCH LET'S FIND OUT LET'S LET THE VA DO WHAT THEY NEED TO DO TO FIND THE RESEARCH AND RIGHT NOW THERE SHOULD BE A- BILL ABOUT REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS THIS SHOULD BE ABOUT OUR VETERANS. WHO SERVED I'VE GOT A SON WHO'S GOT FIVE TOURS FIVE TOURS IN COMBAT. HE'S BEEN THERE HE'S SEEN IT I'M A PAIR TO PUT MY OTHER SON'S BROKE THREE OF US THREE PARATROOPERS IN THE SAME FAMILY AND WE SIT DOWN WE TALK. IN THERE AS HEALTHY AS YOU A NINE. BECAUSE THEY MAINTAIN THE MILITARY WAY IS MEETING WITH THE SOCIAL WORKERS AND THE ABILITY TO TALK TO THEIR BODIES. SO THIS THIS THING ABOUT SELF MEDICATION AND THIS IS WHAT IT IS SO I'M ASKING YOU. AND. AND I'M GOING TO HAVE STAYING ON THIS BILL. IN I THINK IT WE JUST WAIT. JUST WHAT IS THE HURRY. LET'S WAIT ON ON. ON TO SEE WHAT THE RESEARCH WE ASKED ABOUT A TASK FORCE DO WE HAVE ONE OR THEY'RE MOVING ALONG. IF WE CAME BACK NEXT YEAR AND SAID THIS IS THE FINDING THIS IS THE DOOR. FINE BUT I WILL TELL YOU THIS WE CAN'T SPARE ONE SINGLE LIFE. AT ALL. BECAUSE HE OVERDOSED. AND SO I ASK YOU. TO BEAR WITH US. END UP STAYING TODAY SO WE CAN DO MORE RESEARCH. AND AS A VETERAN I TELL YOU AND THERE'S A VETERAN SITTING RIGHT OVER THERE MAKE ONE HERE IN THIS ONE THERE. WE'VE GOT THE VETERAN'S. COMMITTEE MADE UP OF SEVEN VETERANS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN OUR HISTORY AND I'M THE CHAIR. AND I TELL YOU WE'RE ALL WORKING FOR THE SAME THING AND IF I PERSONALLY FELT. THIS WOULD HELP VETERANS ACROSS THE BOARD I WOULD BE FORT. BUT IT DOESN'T NOT JUST YET. SO LET'S BE PATIENT AND- I'D LIKE YOU TO ASK TO INDULGE ME IN. AND GIVING US THE CHANCE. OF STAYING ON THIS VOTE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. SENATOR DODD. YES MA'AM PRESIDENT MEMBERS I WAS NOT PLANNING ON SPEAKING ON THIS IN FACT I'VE MADE STATEMENTS- IN PUBLIC THAT I WAS NEVER GOING TO VOTE FOR THIS BILL. HEY YOU KNOW. I HAD A NUMBER OF PEOPLE COME TO ME AND TRY AND LOOK AT IT'S NOT ABOUT BEING. RIGHTEOUS IT'S NOT ABOUT YOUR BEING RIGHT OR WRONG IN IN TERMS OF AKING THIS DECISION. THE WAY IT COMES DOWN TO ME ATTHIS POINT IN TIME IS. WE ARE LOSING PEOPLE. AT GREAT RATES IN OUR COUNTRY THAT HAVE GONE OVERSEAS TO FIGHT. ON OUR BEHALF INDIA WE'VE ALSO LOST- YOU'LL TALK TRIBE I TALKED TO A NUMBER SERVICE PEOPLE THAT HAD TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY TO GO TO PERU TO GO TO MEXICO TO GO TO EUROPE TO GO TO OTHER PLACES SPEND MORE MONEY TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS TO FACILITATE IT. I'VE ALSO HAD PARENTS THAT HAVE CALLED ME AND SAID THEIR KIDS. WERE A LOST CAUSE. ON HEROIN IT'S CETERA CETERA. THANK GOD ON THIS DRUG THERAPY. WITH THE RIGHT PEOPLE NOW THEY'RE LOOKING THERE'S NO GUARANTEE ONCE IS BELIEVES THAT WE'RE GOING TO CONTROL EVERY SINGLE SINGLE SITUATION CERTAINLY WE'RE NOT CONTROLLING EVERY X. SITUATION TODAY AND WE'RE LOSING KIDS TO THE WAR ON DRUGS STILL. WE'RE LOSING OUR VETERANS ARE TAKING THEIR OWN LIVES SO FOR ME. IT'S A MATTER OF- I JUST YEAH I'D LIKE TO DO NO HARM. BUT AT THE BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY I THINK WE SAVE WAY MORE LIVES IN WE HELP MORE FAMILIES. HE MOVED FORWARD TO TWO TOGETHER IN THESE VETERANS IT I'M GONNA SUPPORT THIS BILL I'VE HAD NUMEROUS PEOPLE IN TERMS OF- YOU KNOW CONTACTED ME REACHING OUT I WAS FRANKLY BLOWN AWAY. ABOUT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT THIS IS REALLY HELPED OUR COUNTRY SO WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. SAYING NO FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ALL THIS TIME SENATOR- YOU MAKE INCLUDE. I THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT BECAUSE I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE FOR THE FOR THE PASSIONATE ANDTHOUGHTFUL DISCUSSION. ABOUT THIS- BILL THESE ARE HARD ISSUES. DRUGS MENTAL HEALTH ADDICTION ARE HARD ISSUES AND THESE ARE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE FRANKLY NOT GRAPPLE WITH AS A SOCIETY AND WE HAVE TRIED SUPERFICIAL POLITICALLY EXPEDIENT SOLUTIONS I HAVEN'T WORKED ON I WANT TO THANK THE SERVER NOT PREFER RAISING PEOPLE WHO AREN'T VETERANS WE HAVE AN AMAZING COALITION OF VETERANS. WHO PEOPLE WHOSE LIVES HAVE BEEN SAID TO HAVE BEEN YOU KNOW WORKING THEIR BEHINDS OFF TO MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD BECAUSE THEY KNOW THERE'S ALSO A LOT. BUT IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THAT EARNS. SOME OF YOU HAVE CITIES ALL LETTER THAT WAS SUBMITTED- BY TWO PEOPLE BY THE NAME OF DAVID AND GRACE. AND DAVID AND GRACE TALKED ABOUT ABOUT TEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS AGO. THEIR SON THEY'RE TEENAGE SON BECAME ADDICTED TO HEROIN. THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE RESOURCES THEY TRIED. EVERY THING EVERYTHING. THAT YOU COULD POSSIBLY TRY EVERY TREATMENT EVERY REHABILITATION EVERY PRINT EVERYTHING. IT ALL FAILED AND HE WAS SPIRALING TOWARDS HOMELESSNESS AND DEATH THAT'S WHERE HE WAS HEADED. THEY SENT HIM BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE RESOURCES TO MEXICO TO AN IDLE GAME PROGRAM WHICH IS A PSYCHEDELIC COVERED BY THIS BILL IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT CAN I MEAN. DESPITE WHAT SOME THE POLITICAL EXPEDIENCE OF FOCUSING ON ONE DRUG TO AN IDLE GAME PROGRAM IN MEXICO HE HAS NOT USED HER ONE SENSE IT SAVED HIS LIFE. SO FOR DAVID AND GRACE OR FOR OTHER PARENTS OR FAMILY MEMBERS WHO WANT TO SAVE THEIR KIDS AND THEIR SISTERS THEIR COUSINS LIFE. SHOULD WE TELL THEM NO YOU CAN'T DO IT UNTIL THE FDA GETS AROUND TO RESCHEDULING THESE DRUGS THAT MIGHT BE IN THREE YEARS OR FIVE YEARS OR SEVEN YEARS JUST WAIT UNTIL THE FDA TAKES ACTION. VENUE CAN SAVE HIS LIFE WAIT FOR THE TASK FORCE TO MEET. ONCE THE TASK FORCE COMES BACK THEN YOU CAN SAVE HIS LIFE I HOPE HE DOESN'T DIE BEFORE THEN. PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING NOW. NOT IN THREE OR FIVE YEARS THEY'RE SUFFERING RIGHT NOW PEOPLE ARE DYING NOW THEY ARE IN CRISIS RIGHT NOW I KOBE HAS MADE UP AWFUL SITUATION EVEN WORSE. PEOPLE ARE SELF MEDICATING NOW WE NEED TO STOP PRETENDING THAT CRIMINALIZING DRUGS AND ARRESTING PEOPLE SOMEHOW STOPS PEOPLE FROM USING DRUGS BUT IF YOU ONLY MAKE IT A CRIME TO HAVE THE DRUG. OR SO IT'S GOING TO DO WHAT YOU SAY AND STOP USING HOW DOES THAT WORK FOR THE LAST FIFTY YEARS WELL WE HAVE INCARCERATED ON ENDING NUMBERS OF PEOPLE FOR POSSESSING A LOW LEVEL DRUG OFFENSES PUTTING THEM AWAY FOR YEARS OR DECADES. NONVIOLENT DRUG OFFENDERS SO THAT WE CAN GET THEM TO STOP USING HAS THAT STOPPED ON. NOT AT ALL IT'S WORSE NOW BEFORE IN TERMS OF DRUG USE THERE'S MORE DRUGS BEING USED NOW. IT HAS FAILED TO SURPRISE OVER SAYING THIS BILL IS NOT TO STOP ARRESTING PEOPLE. LET'S JUST STOP ARRESTING PEOPLE YES WE WANT THE FDA TO GET AROUND TO DOING WHAT IT NEEDS TO DO.

SENATE BILL SIX THIRTY NINE BY SENATOR ALSO AND ACTUALLY TO IMPLEMENT CENTER DRIVE SO THE FLOOR IS YOURS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR TODAY PRESENT AS THREE SIX THIRTY NINE. THIS IS A BILL THAT ENSURES THAT WORKERS WITH DISABILITIES CANNOT SHOULD NOT BE PAID LESS THAN MINIMUM WAGE SINCE THE NINETEEN THIRTIES THE STATE HAS BEEN ABLE TO PAY WORKERS WITH DISABILITIES LESS THAN MINIMUM WAGE THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF FOURTEEN C. CERTIFICATES UNDER THE FEDERAL FAIR LABOR STANDARDS ACT. SO EVEN AS CALIFORNIA PRIDES ITSELF IN LEADING THE COUNTRY WITH A FIFTEEN DOLLAR MINIMUM WAGE AND WORKER PROTECTIONS THERE ARE STILL THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS WITH DISABILITIES ARE STILL BEING EXPLOITED IN SEGREGATED SETTINGS FOR AS LOW AS TWO DOLLARS AN HOUR. S. B. SIX THIRTY NINE PROHIBITS THE ISSUANCE OF NEW FOURTEEN C. CERTIFICATES BY JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO. AND IT DEVELOPS A PHASE OUT PLAN FOR CURRENT EMPLOYERS TO ENSURE A PATH TO COMPETITIVE AND INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT. BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE THIS BILL WOULD END THE PRACTICE OF SEGREGATED SUB MINIMUM WAGE EMPLOYMENT ENTIRELY. COLLEAGUES THIS PRACTICE IS AN ARCHAIC RELIC OF THE NINETEEN THIRTIES AND THE DATES TO A TIME WHEN CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES WERE DENIED AN EDUCATION. BEFORE CIVIL RIGHTS LEGISLATION SUCH AS THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT RECOGNIZE THE FULL HUMANITY OF PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES. IF AND WHEN AND ACTED CALIFORNIA'S GONNA JOIN OTHER STATES THAT HAVE ALREADY PASSED THIS LEGISLATION ALASKA CONNECTICUT MARYLAND NEW HAMPSHIRE NEW YORK RHODE ISLAND TEXAS AND WASHINGTON IN PROHIBITING SUB MINIMUM WAGE EMPLOYMENT OR SHELTERED WORKSHOPS. THIS IS A MEASURE TO OFFER DIGNITY TO WORKERS WITH DISABILITIES AND IT PROVIDES A PATH TO ECONOMIC INDEPENDENCE I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR RIVAL. IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. YES SENATOR- WESSEL REPRESENTED JUST CAUGHT THE LAST KING OF MEMBERS URGE THEIR SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL I CARRIED THIS BILL HERE IN THE SENATE FLOOR. BACK IN TWENTY FOURTEEN THIS IS A THIS IS A GOOD- HUMANE AND THINGS TO DO WITH THAT WILL GIVE THESE INDIVIDUALS THESE WONDERFUL PEOPLE THAT ARE SOME OF THEM WORK VERY HARD EVERY DAY. THE DESERVE AT LEAST A MINIMUM WAGE- THE RIGHT TO GET ONE IN OUR STATE I DON'T WE DON'T REALLY HAVE DESERVE A LAW SAY THAT PEOPLE ARE HALF A PERSON OR A QUARTER OF A PERSON OR A- EVEN A SIXTEEN PER PERSON SO- THIS IS A VERY HUMANE WONDERFUL BILL MINORS PEOPLE TO VOTE FOR IT. SEND GLACIER. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS HI THIS BILL CERTAINLY HAS GOOD INTENTIONS TO PREVENT THE EXPLOITATION OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. BUT THERE ARE SOME UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES- THAT I WANTED TO RAISE. I'VE BEEN HEARING FROM MY CONSTITUENTS THAT THE BILL WOULD PREVENT PEOPLE WITH THE MOST SERIOUS DISABILITIES. INCLUDING THOSE BORN WITH SEVERE DOWN SYNDROME. CEREBRAL PALSY AUTISM FROM EVEN GETTING A JOB. THESE FOLKS ARE CURRENTLY EMPLOYED BY WHAT ARE KNOWN AS SHELTERED OR WORK ACTIVITIES WORKSHOPS FOR THOSE WITH SIGNIFICANT DISABILITIES. THIS LEGISLATION AS THE AUTHOR INDICATED WOULD ELIMINATE THIS CATEGORY. IF THIS HAPPENS THE COMPANIES THAT NOW EMPLOY THESE PEOPLE WILL LIKELY HIRE PEOPLE IN THE DISABLED COMMUNITY WHO COULD DO THE JOB MORE QUICKLY. OTHERWISE THEY'D BE PAYING TWICE AS MUCH PER HOUR. SAVE FIFTEEN DOLLARS RATHER THAN SEVEN FIFTY. TWO PEOPLE WHO MIGHT TAKE TWICE AS LONG TO DO THE TASK. THAT'S NOT A SUSTAINABLE MODEL FOR THEM. AND IN THE LONG RUN IT COULD HARM THE VERY PEOPLE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO HELP. I WOULD ENCOURAGE AND URGE THE AUTHOR IS SHE MOVES THIS BILL FORWARD. TO CONSIDER WAYS TO PROTECT THE MOST VULNERABLE. IN THE DISABLED COMMUNITY SO THEY CAN CONTINUE TO WORK THE INTENTIONS OF THE BILL- ADMIRABLE BUT THERE IS A CLASS. OF THOSE THAT ARE DISABLED THAT REALLY CAN'T BE HARMED. BY THIS LEGISLATION THANK YOU. IS THERE. I HAVE MORE DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. ON THIS ITEM. AT CENTER GROVE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND I DO TEND TO AGREE WITH MY COLLEGE IS CALLING IT JUST BRIEFLY SPOKE I AM I DO KNOW THE AUTHOR'S HEART AND THEN IT IS IN THE RIGHT PLACE TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES ARE MAKING MORE AT THE MINIMUM WAGE FOR MORE AND THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT BUT THEREARE INDIVIDUALS OUT THERE AT OUR BAKERSFIELD ASSOCIATION ARE BIGGER SO ARC EMPLOYEES PEOPLE- IN THE SHELTERED WORKSHOPS. AND SOME OF THE INDIVIDUALS THAT MAKE MINIMUM WAGE- CAN BAG A PRODUCT RIGHT YOU KNOW FIFTY TO A HUNDRED PRODUCTS TODAY AND THEN SOME INDIVIDUALS WITH IT YOU KNOW SEVERE INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES- ONLY BACK MAYBE THREE PRODUCTS A DAY WHEN THEY DO THIS PROCESS BUT THE DIGNITY OF BEING ABLE TO GO TO WORK EVEN IF YOU'RE ONLY BAGGING THREE PRODUCTS A DAY OR A SIT ASSEMBLING THREE BAGS TO BE DISTRIBUTED. WHEN I SAY BAGS OF STUFF THAT GOES INTO THE PRISON SYSTEM AND THINGS LIKE THAT. COME FRESH- TOOTHPASTE SOAP. THE INDIVIDUALS WITH THE SEVERE INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES ARE GOING TO BE THE ONES THAT ARE HURT. WHEN YOU GO TALK TO THESE PEOPLE. IT'S NOT THE FACT THAT THE BAG ONLY THREE THREE PUT TOGETHER THREE PACKAGES A DAY. IT'S THE FACT THAT THEY CARRY THEIR LUNCH PAIL AD THEY'VE GOT A JOB AND- THEY TAKE PRIDE IN THAT JOB IT MAY TAKE THEM SEVERAL HOURS TO PUT THOSE SMALL PACKAGES TOGETHER- BUT I JUST SEE THAT. WITH THIS BILL- AND I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU FIX IT I MEAN I DON'T I DON'T EVEN HAVE A SOLUTION I DON'T KNOW IF YOU. GAUGE IT ON SOMEBODY'S DISABILITY- THOSE ARE SEVERELY IMPAIRED WOULD STILL BE ABLE TO WORK IN THE SHELTERED WORKSHOPS AND- AND BE PAID IN ORDER TO HAVE THAT DIGNITY OF HAVING A JOB WITH THOSE THAT ARE. YOU KNOW MORE QUALIFIED OR OR LESS DISABLED I'M NOT SURE HOW YOU EVEN WORD IT. BECAUSE IT'S A VERY TOUGH K- AREA TO WORK IN. AND I SEE YOUR HEART ON THE LEGISLATION AND THEY SHOULD BE PAID MORE THAN YOU KNOW MINIMUM WAGE- BUT- BUT I JUST DON'T SEE EMPLOYERS. I DON'T SEE EMPLOYERS OR INDIVIDUALS HIRING INDIVIDUALS TO DO. A JOB THAT WOULD TAKE SOMEONE ALL DAY TO DO IT BECAUSE OF THEIR INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY. AND THEN NOT HAVING THAT. THAT PRIDE OF HAVING A JOB I HAVE A- INDIVIDUAL SEVERELY DISABLED. RUN DOWN SYNDROME SEVERELY DOWN SYNDROME. YOUNG MAN HE'S TWENTY THREE YEARS OLD AND HE CARRIES HIS LUNCH BAG HIS BAIL HIS LUNCH PAIL. LIKE HIS DAD EVERY DAY TO WORK. AND HE'S ONE OF THE LOWEST PERFORMERS IN THAT DRIVE. BUT THE IDEA THAT HE HAS A JOB AND HE GETS A LUNCH BREAK. AND HE TALKS TO HIS COLLEAGUES AND HE HAS A LIFE OTHER THAN BEING AT HOME- I THINK IT'S SIGNIFICANT FOR HIM. BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT HE WOULD BE SOMEBODY THAT WOULD LOSE HIS JOB HIS NAME IS GARRETT. AND I BELIEVE THAT HE WOULD BE SOMEBODY THAT WOULD LOSE HIS JOB BECAUSE THERE'S NO WAY THAT SOMEBODY WOULD PAY MINIMUM WAGE TO DO THE WORK PRODUCT THAT HE DOES- AND I JUST THINK THAT LIKE I SAID YOUR HEART IS RIGHT MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES. BUT I HAVE A GRAVE CONCERN ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO WOULD LOSE THEIR JOB AND THEIR DIGNITY. BECAUSE. THEY COULDN'T FULFILL THE OBLIGATIONS OF WITH A MINIMUM WAGE EARNER WOULD- BECAUSE- TO DO. SENATOR LEYVA. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I JUST HAVE TO STAND IN STRONG SUPPORT I LOVE THIS BILL- WHEN I WAS FIRST ELECTED I TOURED A COUPLE FACILITIES IN MY DISTRICT WITH A DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED FOLKS WHO WERE WORKING AND WE'RE SO EXCITED AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM BAKERSFIELD SAYS THEY WERE SO EXCITED TO BE WORKING AND BEING PRODUCTIVE AND AS WE WERE WALKING THROUGH A SATELLITE WILL HOW MUCH DO THEY MAKE IT AND SOME ARE MADE LIKE TWO DOLLARS SO MAYBE LIKE THREE DOLLARS AND I SAID. DID I HEAR YOU. AND I JUST THOUGHT THAT THAT WAS APPALLING THESE FOLKS WHO ARE COMING TO WORK AND ARE EXCITED TO COME TO WORK. THAT WE COULD BE ALLOWED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEM I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE COULD BE SOME CONFLICT OR SOME. OTHER PROBLEM BECAUSE MAYBE THEY DON'T PRODUCE AS MUCH SOME GROUPS OF PEOPLE. BUT YOU DON'T LET'S NOT JUST SAY NO WHAT'S UP WITH THE BABY OUT WITH THE BATH WATER LET'S FIND A WAY TO MAKE IT WORK MAYBE THERE'S A SUBSIDY THAT CAN BE PUT IN FOR THAT THAT PARTICULAR COMPANY. ALL WORK HAS VALUE AND BECAUSE YOU'RE A LITTLE SLOWER THAN SOMEONE ELSE. I THINK IT'S REALLY INSULTING TO SAY THAT YOU DON'T EVEN DESERVE MINIMUM WAGE I PERSONALLY THINK THAT WE ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THESE FOLKS. BECAUSE THEY ARE MENTALLY DISABLED SO I STRONGLY STAND IN STRONG SUPPORT. AND FOR THOSE WHO ARE WORRIED ABOUT BUSINESSES BEING PUT OUT OF BUSINESS OR WHATNOT I THINK THAT'S A VERY SMALL FRACTION OF THE PEOPLE THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. AND LET'S FIND A WAY TO TAKE CARE OF THAT SO WE DON'T CONTINUE DISADVANTAGING THESE PEOPLE ARE SHOWING UP AND WORKING HARD EVERY DAY AND WE'RE ASKING IS THAT THEY MAKE MINIMUM WAGE. SO I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRING IT FORWARD AND I STRESS AND STRONG SUPPORT. IS THERE ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. SINGMAN CENTER DRAWS SO YOU MAY CONCLUDE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- AND I UNDERSTAND SOME OF THE ISSUES HAD THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED AND THAT'S BECAUSE FRANKLY AS A SOCIETY WE STILL HAVE A TUNEL BARRIERS BERRY IS A STILL EXIS FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND NOT LOOKING AT THEM WITH THE FULL HUMANITY THAT THEY REPRESENT AND THE FACT THAT THEY LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE CAN BE DIFFERENT FROM ONE ANOTHER JUST LIKE WE'RE DIFFERENT FROM ONE ANOTHER. THEY SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO LOOK FOR WHAT IT KIND OF WHAT KIND OF CAREER THEY WANT JUST LIKE WE DO. AND AND I THINK THAT MORE AND MORE BECAUSE OF OUR LAWS THAT WERE PASSING CALIFORNIA HAS THIS COMPETITIVE INTEGRATED EMPLOYMENT BLUEPRINT GOING IN THAT DIRECTION- THERE ARE MORE OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE PRIDE INDUSTRIES AND THE SAN DIEGO GROUP OPTIONS FOR ALL THAT HAVE ALREADY PHASED OUT THERE SOME MINIMUM WAGE PROGRAMS WE'RE GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION LET'S LET'S GO EVEN FURTHER BY ALLOWING THESE MEN AND WOMEN- TO.

HYDROGEN FUEL CELLS ARE AN IDEAL ALTERNATIVE FUEL SOLUTION TO ELECTRIFIED MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY COMMERCIAL VEHICLES AND THESE VEHICLES ARE NECESSARY COMPONENT TO ACHIEVING CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE AND AIR QUALITY GOALS. HOWEVER THERE EXISTED A KNOWLEDGE GAP REGARDING THE HYDROGEN INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS REQUIRED FOR CALIFORNIA MEET ITS CARBON NEUTRALITY GOALS THE STATE AGENCIES LIKE ENERGY UTILITIES AND THAT LEGISLATOR BLACK SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE OF THE AMOUNT OF HYDROGEN FUELING INFRASTRUCTURE AND HYDROGEN FUEL PRODUCTION NEEDED TO MEET CALIFORNIA'S CLEAN AIR GOALS.

SENATE BILL SIX SIXTY FIVE BY SENATOR UMBERG AN ACT RELATING TO EMPLOYMENT CENTER UNDER THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES- THERE'S BEEN A FEW BILLS THAT HAVE BEEN PRESENT ON THE FLOOR TODAY. THAT HAVE USED A SUPPORT FOR VETERANS AS AT LEAST ONE OF ITS RATIONALES THIS IS ALSO A BILL THAT SUPPORTS VETERANS IT DOESN'T A DIFFERENT WAY IT SUPPORTS VETERANS. WITH THE JOB. CALIFORNIA IS IN THE VANGUARD. IN MANY YEARS IT'S IN THE VANGUARD WITH RESPECT TO THIS ISSUE AS WELL BECAUSE FIFTY STATES. PROVIDE INSTANT IN TERMS OF THE STATE GOVERNMENT PROVIDE A PREFERENCE FOR VETERANS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PROVIDES A HIRING PREFERENCE FOR VETERANS THIRTY NINE STATES PROVIDED HIRING PREFERENCE FOR VETERANS IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR. CALIFORNIA DOES NOT CALIFORNIA DOES NOT. MAYBE RECEIVED A FLORAL ARTS CONSIDERING THIS BILL AND ITS DISPARATE IMPACT INDEED THERE IS A DISPARATE IMPACT THERE'S A DISPARATE IMPACT- MILITARY HISTORICALLY HAS BEEN DOMINATED BY MALES THAT'S CHANGING NOT CHANGING QUICKLY ENOUGH WHEN I JOINED IT WAS 8% FEMALE NOW IS WERE VIRTUALLY NO FEMALE GENERALS THERE ARE EIGHTY ONE FEMALE FEMALE GENERALS TODAY. I KNOW I MARRIED ONE. THINGS ARE CHANGING MILITARY WOULD DISCRIMINATE ON THE BASIS OF SEXUAL ORIENTATION FOR MANY MANY YEARS THAT'S WRONG THIS BILL WAS AMENDED AN APPROPRIATIONS IS APPROPRIATELY SO TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE WHO WERE DISCHARGED BECAUSE THEIR SEXUAL ORIENTATION. WOULD BE CONSIDERED A VETERAN FOR PURPOSES OF THIS BILL. THERE IS A DISPARATE IMPACT. BECAUSE THOSE WHO JOIN THE MILITARY ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY AFRICAN AMERICANS ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY LATINO THEY'RE DISPROPORTIONATELY POORER THAN MANY OF US. MANY JOIN THE MILITARY AS I DID. IN ORDER TO SEEK A COLLEGE EDUCATION AND FOR THAT REASON ALONE. AND SO THERE IS A DISPARATE IMPACT- THE BILL SIMPLY SAYS THAT THE PRIVATE SECTOR CAN DO WITH THE GOVERNMENT DOESN'T PROVIDE A PREFERENCE FOR VETERANS IN HIRING ORIGINAL VOTE. IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM SENATOR OR CHILL THAT. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I RISE IS THE CHAIR OF THE MILITARY VETERANS COMMITTEE AND I URGENTLY- ASK EVERYONE FOR THEIR I WROTE. THIS BILL TAKES BIG STEP FORWARD WE TALKED ABOUT TODAY BODY KNOWLEDGE IN SUPPORTING OUR VETERANS TO PROTECTING THEM TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE EQUALLY TREATED WHEN THEY COME HOME GIVEN EVERY OPPORTUNITY.

AND THOSE SKILLS ARE REAL AND SO- EVEN THOUGH THIS BILL DOESN'T ADDRESS THE SKILL SET TRANSFERS IT DOES ALLOW AND EMPLOYERS TO GIVE A PREFERENCE. TO VETERANS FOR HIRING EMPLOYMENT AND EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES WITHOUT BEING WORRIED ABOUT- DISCRIMINATE LUCIEN LAWSUITS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT SO.

SHE IS PLEASE READ. SENATE BILL SIX SEVENTY FOUR BY SENATOR DORADO AN ACT RELATING TO PUBLIC CONTRACTS SENATOR EYES OF THE FORGERS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIRMAN. THIS BILL SIX SEVENTY FOUR WILL SUPPORT THE CREATION OF EQUITABLE HIGH QUALITY TRANSPORTATION AND RELATED MANUFACTURING JOBS IN OUR STATE. IT'S GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BENEFITS OF THE TRANSITION TO CLEAN TRANSPORTATION INCLUDE WELL PAID JOBS FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS IN PARTICULAR. ON OUTREACH TO COMMUNITIES THAT HISTORICALLY BEEN LEFT OUT. THIS BILL WILL ENACT THE CALIFORNIA JOBS PLAN TO CREATE A CLEAR PARTNERSHIPS WITH COMPANIES BENEFITING FROM PUBLICLY FUNDED TRANSPORTATION CONTRACTS AND SUBSIDIES WITH CLEAN AND TRANSPARENT COMMITMENTS. JOBS PLAN IS A COMPONENT OF THE APPLICATION SUBMITTED BY APPLICANTS FOR COVERED PUBLIC CONTRACTS THAT SPECIFIES THE MINIMUM NUMBER OF JOB THEY WILL BE CREATING. THE PROPOSED WAGES BENEFITS INVESTMENT IN TRAINING AND TARGETED HIRING PLANS FOR DISPLACED WORKERS OR INDIVIDUALS- HISTORICALLY EXCLUDED. THE JOBS PLAN COMPONENT WILL NOT REQUIRE ANY NEW MINIMUM COMMITMENTS OTHER THAN THOSE ALREADY REQUIRED BY RELEVANT FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL LAWS. PRESIDENT BUYING HAS BEEN CLEARED THE PUBLIC DOLLARS SHOULD CREATE COMMUNITY BENEFITS HIS EXECUTIVE ORDER ON CLIMATE IMPLEMENTS IS THE FIRST TIME FEDERAL POLICY IS PAIRING THE URGENT ISSUES. OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS WITH THE CREATION OF NEW GOOD JOBS FOR INDUSTRY WORKERS AND PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN HEAVILY POLLUTED COMMUNITIES. THAT IS WHY PARTNERSHIPS WITH BUSINESS CAN LEAD TO PROSPERITY FOR EVERYONE AND THE SUSTAINABLE HEALTHY FUTURE FOR OUR STATE LAST YEAR'S AB THREE NINETY EIGHT REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE QUOTE PUTTING CALIFORNIA ON THE HIGH ROAD OF JOBS AND CLIMATE ACTION PLAN FOR TWENTY THIRTY. IDENTIFIES GOODS MOVEMENT AND THE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE AS THE SINGLE BIGGEST CONTRIBUTOR. OF POLLUTION IT ALSO SAYS THAT THE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM UNDERPINS OUR ECONOMY THE FREIGHT SYSTEM MOVES TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF GOODS EACH YEAR SUPPORTING NEARLY ONE THIRD OF THE ECONOMY AND MORE THAN FIVE MILLION JOBS. LAST YEAR. THIS LAST YEAR'S PULL BACK THE CURTAIN ON INEQUITIES ACROSS SO MANY OF OUR INSTITUTIONS MAKE CLEAR WHO'S HIT HIT THE HARDEST I MET WITH SEVERAL TRANSIT AGENCIES RECEIVED IDEAS TO MAKE THIS A BETTER BILL.

SENATOR COME UNDER THE FLOOR IS YOURS THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT SP SIX SEVEN NINE WHICH WILL CREATE THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY. AFFORDABLE HOUSING SOLUTIONS AGENCY ALSO KNOWN AS LE CASA. THIS BILL WILL CREATE A SINGLE INDEPENDENT COUNTY WIDE AGENCY THAT IS DESIGNED TO SUPPORT LOW INCOME RENTERS PRESERVE HOUSING THAT IS AFFORDABLE AND INNOVATE NEW WAYS TO CREATE AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN EVERY COMMUNITY ACROSS LA COUNTY. WITH A SINGLE UNIFIED APPROACH WILL MAXIMIZE THE SCALE AND RESOURCES OF THE COUNTY. IT WILL ALSO MAKE SURE THERE IS FAIR REPRESENTATION FOR EXPERTS CITIES AND THE COUNTY ON THE GOVERNING AND CITIZENS OVERSIGHT BOARDS. LA COUNTY UNFORTUNATELY RANKS LAST IN THE NATION IN HOUSING AFFORDABILITY OVERCROWDING AND UNSHELTERED HOMELESSNESS WE SEE THE CONSEQUENCES IN OUR RACIALLY SEGREGATED OVERCROWDED HOMES. LOW INCOME FAMILIES BEING PUSHED OUT OF THEIR HOMES AND FAR AWAY FROM THEIR JOBS AND OUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS LIVING OUTSIDE ON THE SIDEWALKS. S. B. SIX SEVEN NINE IS AN EXCITING BELL IT IS AN AMBITIOUS BILL THAT IS SUPPORTED BY A LARGE AND DIVERSE COALITION OF LABOR AND JUSTICE ADVOCATES BUSINESS AND MORE. WE ALL KNOW THAT THE STATUS QUO ISN'T WORKING. F. B. SIX SEVEN NINE OFFERS A POWERFUL WAY FORWARD FOR LA COUNTY AT THE SCALE THAT WE DESPERATELY NEED. I AM EXCITED TO OFFER THIS LEGISLATION AND APPRECIATE SEVERAL OF MY COLLEAGUES FROM LOS ANGELES JOINING ON AS CO AUTHORS THIS IS A PRIORITY BILL FOR THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY DELEGATION. I WANTED TO GIVE SPECIAL APPRECIATE APPRECIATION TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY SENATOR HERZBERG FOR HIS SUPPORT DURING MY TRANSITION. ON THIS BILL AND I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT YOU KNOW ON MOTHER'S DAY. I HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF RUNNING INTO A FAMILY OF FIVE. THAT WAS LIVING IN THEIR SUV AND THE PARK NEXT TO MY HOME. AND AS I TALK TO THEM I LEARNED. THAT THEY DRIVE FROM CITY TO CITY THE DRIVE FROM AGENCY TO AGENCY LOOKING FOR HELP AND THEY DO THEIR PART THEY FILL OUT APPLICATION AFTER APPLICATION THEY GIVE UP THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION TIME AND TIME AGAIN. LOOKING FOR A PARKING SPACE WHERE THEY CAN SLEEP AT NIGHT THAT'S SAFE OR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THIS IS OUR OPPORTUNITY TO DO OUR PART. TO OFFER A COORDINATED SOLUTION A COORDINATED RESPONSE TO THE NEEDS. OF THE SHINE AND STAR AND THEIR THREE CHILDREN I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. SENATOR BRING TINA. THANK YOU AMANDA PRESIDENT- I RISE SO RESPECTFULLY- TO- A COMPLIMENT THE AUTHOR FOR THIS CREATIVE APPROACH TO HOUSING DOING A COUNTY WIDE BUT I MUST RESPECTFULLY- LAY OFF THE BILL TODAY- MIGHT CHALLENGE IS THE CONCENTRATION OF THE BOARD THE MAKEUP OF THE BOARD THE GOVERNANCE- WE'VE SEEN IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY THAT- SO OFTEN BOARDS ARE HEAVILY SKEWED TOWARDS. THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES IN THIS CASE I BELIEVE THEY'RE GONNA EIGHT REPRESENTATIVES ON THE BOARD AND THEN BUT THE FIVE SUPERVISORS ON TOP OF THAT THAT'S MORE THAN HALF OF THE BOARD MAKE UP WOULD BE CONCENTRATED IN DOWNTOWN LA AND I JUST THINK LOS ANGELES COUNTY IS MADE UP OF EIGHTY EIGHT CITIES I KNOW THE PART THE AUTHOR HAS MADE EFFORTS TO TRY TO SPREAD THE BOARD LEADERSHIP AROUND- I'M STILL NOT. A 100% THEY ARE IN SEEING THAT IT'S NOT SO LA CENTRIC. AND I DO THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT. WHEN YOU HAVE EIGHTY EIGHT CITIES YOU CAN'T HAVE ONE PARTICULAR ORGANIZATION DOMINATING SO MUCH I KNOW THE CITY OF LONG BEACH. HAS REPRESENTATION ON THE BOARD BUT THE LARGE CITIES TO THE SOUTH OF LA THE LARGE CITIES. TO THE EAST OF LA INTO THE WEST OF LA DON'T HAVE THAT REPRESENTATION DIRECTLY THAT LA AND LONG BEACH TO SO FOR THOSE REASONS I'M GOING TO OPPOSE THE BILL TODAY. SENATOR DRESSEL. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I RISE AS A PRIVATE COLLECTOR IN SUPPORT OF SB SIX SEVENTY NINE AND I'M PROUD TO SUPPORT UNITED WAY I WORKED WITH UNITED WAY FOR MANY YEARS AND ALL THE THING THAT THEY DO ESPECIALLY AROUND HOUSING- AND THE HOMELESS HAS BEEN A VERY VERY IMPORTANT FOR LOS ANGELES. AND THIS PANDEMIC WE ALREADY KNOW EXASPERATED WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW TO BE THE CASE HOUSING CRISIS IN MY DISTRICT AND ACROSS LA COUNTY. MAKE CLEAR WHAT WE KNOW TO BE TRUE OUR COMMUNITIES ARE BEING FORCED TO MAKE THE UNTENABLE CHOICE IN WHERE AND HOW THEY LIVE. WE ARE CLEARLY NOT DOING ENOUGH TO PRESERVE AND CREATE HOMES FOR WORKING PEOPLE FOR LOW INCOME PEOPLE IN THE COUNTY. THIS BILL HAS STRONG SUPPORT. FROM THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT ROUTE THAT REPRESENT HARD WORKING PEOPLE THE STATE BUILDING TRADES A HOTEL AND FOOD SERVICE WORKERS THE SERVICE EMPLOYEES WORK. THESE ARE WORKERS THAT ARE BEING PRICED OUT OF THEIR COMMUNITY AND FORCED TO ENDURE LONG COMMUTES TO THEIR JOBS WE NEED A COMPREHENSIVE COUNTY WIDE APPROACH. TO HOUSING- ESPECIALLY FOR WORKING AND LOW INCOME PEOPLE THEY CAN ACCESS IT AND AFFORD- THIS IS A PATH FORWARD FOR CREATING HOUSING AFFORDABILITY ACROSS THE COUNTY. I URGE YOUR EYEBALLS THANK YOU. SENATOR HERTZBERG. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT SO. THE LA COUNTY DELEGATION. WHICH IS THIRTY SOME MEMBERS. OF BOTH HOUSES HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS ISSUE. OF HOUSING FOR A LONG TIME MORE THAN A YEAR WE HAD A SERIES OF MEETINGS WE'VE HAD A NUMBER OF EXPERTS MACKENZIE AT. UCLA AND THE LIKE. IN AN EFFORT TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT DO WE DO WITH THE HOUSING ISSUE IN LOS ANGELES AND HOW DO WE PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH AS WAS MENTIONED. THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES WHICH IS NEARLY A THIRD OF THE POPULATION OF THE CITY CALIFORNIA INCLUDES EIGHTY EIGHT CITIES. HE SAID THE OPERATING DIFFERENTLY. ONE OF THE GREAT CHALLENGES WITH THE EXPERTS WITH WHOM WE CAN FOR IS THAT WE DON'T REALLY HAVE A COORDINATED ENTITY. SO GROUP OF FOLKS AS WAS MENTIONED INCLUDING UNITED WAY AS MANY AS TWENTY ORGANIZATIONS CAME TOGETHER IN A VERY THOUGHTFUL WAY. TO FORM THE FOUNDATION OF THE IDEAS CONTAINED. IN THIS MEASURE. THE QUESTION IS CAN WE CREATE AN ENTITY. THAT CAN DEAL MORE BROADLY ACROSS THE LINES OF CITY AFTER CITY. WHATEVER THOSE REPRESENTATIONS WERE A LOT OF WORK WAS DONE WITH THE COUNTIES AND THE CITIES TO GET TO GOAL WE HAVE IN LA COUNTY. A SERIES OF ENTITIES THE SANITATION DISTRICTS THE METROPOLITAN WATER DISTRICT INCLUDES OTHER COUNTIES WE HAVE A WHOLE HOST OF. ORGANIZATIONS JOINT POWERS AUTHORITIES THE LIKE THE DEAL WITH THE COMPLEXITIES THAT WE FACE AS WE TRY TO GOVERN WHAT IS LOST IN THE AIR LOS ANGELES AREA. AND SO I WANT TO APPLAUD AND SAY THAT I WILL STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS MEASURE. AND GIVE GREAT CREDIT TO THOSE BEHIND THIS AS WELL AS TO THE AUTHOR OF THIS MEASURE. I THINK I'M A CO AUTHOR I BELIEVE- IF NOT I WANT TO BE AND- I WOULD APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS MISSION THANK YOU. SENATOR RUBIO. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE SENATE- TODAY I WANT TO STAND AND- VALIDATE THE COMMENTS OF MY- COLLEAGUE FROM LOCKING OUT A- I THINK THAT- IT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT FOR THE SINGLE FAMILY AND I HAVE TO SHARE THAT- FIRST OF ALL I WANNA THANK THE AUTHOR FOR WORKING SO CLOSELY WITH ME AND TRYING TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES BUT- THE ISSUE IS NOT THE HOUSING TRUST WE ALL AGREED THAT WE HAVE TO. DO SOMETHING TO CREATE MORE HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA BUT IT'S REALLY ABOUT THE REPRESENTATION OF TRADITIONALLY HISTORICALLY THE SANGRO VALLEY HAS BEEN DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BY SOMEBODY- KELLY WHITE POLICIES AND WE JUST HAPPEN TO BEONE OF THE ONLY DISTRICTS WHO ALREADY HAS A HOUSING TRUST THAT SAID STATE THAT'S ESTABLISHED IT'S WORKING IT'S ALREADY PRODUCING A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE HOUSING UNITS AND THAT'S BEEN DONE IN THE AND THE LAST TWO YEARS SEOUL. OUR COMMUNITIES FEAR IS THAT THIS NEW HOUSING TRUST IS GOING TO DERAIL THE GOOD WORK THAT'S ALREADY BEEN IMPLEMENTED AND SO I DO WANT TO SAY THAT THE AUTHOR IS BEEN EXTREMELY GRACIOUS AND TRYING TO WORK WITH ME TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR COMMUNITIES CAN GET ON BOARD AND SO WE'VE HAD PLENTY OF DISCUSSIONS AND SHE'S GIVING ME EVERY ASSURANCE THAT SHE WILL CONTINUE TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS OF MY COMMUNITY AND SO WITH THAT I JUST WANTED TO. STATE THAT OUR COMMUNITIES ARE NOT OPPOSED TO HOUSING THE FACT IS THAT WE'RE ALREADY CREATING pSURE IT'S AFFORDABLE AND WE DON'T END UP DERAILING ALL THE WORK. WE'VE DONE UP TO NOW THANK YOU. IS THERE ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION- OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM SENATOR WIENER. I THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. WE SAW THE STORM THE HOUSING COMMITTEE AS WELL AS THE GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE COMMITTEE- IT'S A BILL% THAT IT TOOK A LOT OF WORK AND I THINK IT'S A VERY WELL CONSTRUCTED BILL- WE DID THIS YOU MAY RECALL A FEW YEARS AGO THE LEGISLATURE AUTHORIZED. THE BAY AREA TO COME TOGETHER AS A REGION GO TO THE BALLOT TO FUND. THIS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT NEED OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING- AND I'M REALLY THRILLED THAT AWAY- IS MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION AS WELL LIKE THE BAY AREA- LA- CONTINUES TO HEAD IN A DIRECTION WHERE IT'S- MORE MORE. DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE TO AFFORD TO LIVE THERE AND SOME PEOPLE LEAVE. THEY MOVED FAR AWAY OR TRAGICALLY THEY BECOME HOMELESS- THIS IS A MEANINGFUL AND THOUGHTFUL. EFFORT TO TRY TO STEM THAT TIDE AND I ASKED FOR AND I VOTE. IS THERE ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. SAYING MAN SENATOR YOU MAY CONCLUDE THANK YOU I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES FROM- THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY AND FROM- THE BAY AREA FOR THEIR SUPPORT AND I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES FROM THE SAN GABRIEL VALLEY FOR THEIR- HONEST CONVERSATIONS WITH ME- ABOUT THEIR CONSTITUENTS- AND THIS BILL- YOU KNOW BASED ON THE RENO GOALS ARE FOR THE IT'S SIX CYCLE. LOS ANGELES COUNTY IS SUPPOSED TO PRODUCE. CLOSE TO THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND UNITS. WE ARE ON TRACK TO PRODUCE LESS THAN TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND. THAT IS NOT SOLVING THE PROBLEM THAT IS EXACERBATING THE PROBLEM. AND THE MORE WE RE ENFORCED THIS FRAGMENTATION IN OUR COUNTY THE HARDER THIS ISSUE WILL BE TO SOLVE. I APPLAUD THE WORK THAT SENATOR RUBIO DID IN CREATING THE SAN GABRIEL VALLEY HOUSING TRUST FUND- ABSOLUTELY THAT WAS- A HEAVY LIFT AND REALLY IMPORTANT FOR THAT COMMUNITY- AND I WOULD ADD THAT THIS HOUSING AUTHORITY WOULD ONLY SUPPLEMENT AND COMPLEMENT THOSE HOUSING TRUSTS THAT ARE ALREADY IN EXISTENCE. THE IDEA IS TO. COLLECTIVELY AS ONE ENTITY WITH INCREASED TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY. FIGHTS ARE AFFORD CRY. BY PRESERVING UNITS BY PRODUCING MORE UNITS AND I PUT RENTERS AND THAT IS WHAT THE DOES WE HAVE TO BE TETHERED TOGETHER FOR THE SOLUTION I WANT TO ALSO ADD THAT WE HAVE TAKEN A NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS ARE THE MOST RECENT TAKEN IN THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE WHICH PROVIDE A ROBUST GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE THAT IS REPRESENTATIVE OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND IN FACT WE EXPANDED THE BOARD TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE WAS REPRESENTATION FROM ACROSS THE REGION. OF LOS ANGELES. I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS BILL. I LOOK FORWARD TO US ALL J. COLLECTIVELY AND FINE SO. FOR OUR HOUSING OF CRISIS IN LOS ANGELES CAN.

SIX NINETY THREE THE NEVER AGAIN EDUCATION ACT. DOES IT MEAN WHEN WE SAY NEVER AGAIN. MEMBERS AND I ASK OF YOU TO TAKE YOUR CONVERSATIONS OFF THE FLOOR IF YOU COULD- IT'S GETTING. S. AND YOUNGER GENERATIONS THAN THEM. WHEN ASKED IN A RECENT POLL DON'T KNOW WHAT OUR IS. JEWS WERE ATTACKED ON THE STREETS OF LOS ANGELES LAST WEEK A CINDER BLOCK WAS THROWN THROUGH A SYNAGOGUE WINDOW THIS PAST WEEKEND. PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ATTACKING. PEOPLE OF THE JEWISH FAITH ON TWITTER SEVENTEEN THOUSAND TWEETS IN THE LAST THREE WEEKS THAT HAD THE HASH TAG HITLER WAS RIGHT EMANATING FROM THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THE HASHTAG HAS BEEN TRENDING THIS PAST WEEK. EVEN IN CALIFORNIA'S HASH TAG COVE INTO NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT. AS IN THE FOUNDING OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL AFTER THE HOLOCAUST WAS SOMEHOW. A VIRUS UNLEASHED UPON THE PEOPLE OF THE WORLD. THE VERY VALID DEBATES ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE MIDDLE EAST HAVE BLED INTO OUTRIGHT XENOPHOBIA AND ANTI SEMITISM IN OUR COMMUNITIES. I WAS WALKING THREE BLOCKS AWAY FROM. A GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT WERE ATTACKED WITH. MY WIFE IN FATHER IN LAW WHO ACTUALLY SURVIVED AUSCHWITZ. AND A WALK IN FEAR ON THE STREETS OF LOS ANGELES WHEN YOU ACTUALLY ARE WEARING A COUPON OR HAVE A MUG IN DIRE NEED OF A STAR OF DAVID ON YOUR CHEST AND FEEL UNSAFE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS A SHAME. AND IT STARTS WITH EDUCATION AT ITS CORE THIS BILL HERE TODAY WOULD MAKE OUR HOLOCAUST EDUCATION PROCESS AND GENOCIDE EDUCATION IN OUR SCHOOLS NOT JUST A CHECK BOX WE READ IN FRANK. AND YOU SAY THAT'S THAT'S I DID MY DUTY I DID MY WORK. WE HAVE TO MAKE THIS ACTION ORIENTED EDUCATION AND NOT DIVIDE THE JEWISH COMMUNITY. IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY FROM THE LATINO COMMUNITY FROM THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY FROM API COMMUNITY AND- ALL THE OTHERS. THIS CANNOT BE- AND IDENTITY BASED POLITICAL WARFARE SO THIS THIS BILL HOPEFULLY WILL START TO BRING ABOUT SOME HEALING BY MODERNIZING. OUR CURRICULUM BY EMPOWERING YOUNG PEOPLE TO TAKE MATTERS INTO THEIR OWN HANDS. AS WARRIORS FOR TOLERANCE AND FOR DIVERSITY. THIS BILL IS SACRED WORK I SINCERELY APPRECIATE THE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION SUPPORT AND TEACHERS FOR COMING ON BOARD AND MINISTRY LEADERS AND FOR THOSE INVOLVED WITH ARMENIAN GENOCIDE EDUCATION FOR STEPPING UP AND SAYING NEVER AGAIN- MEMBERS. COLLECTIVE MEMORY LOSS IS A IS A VERY DANGEROUS. A DANGEROUS TREND IN OUR SOCIETY WHEN YOU SEE PEOPLE GOING INTO OUR CAPITAL IN JANUARY SIX WEARING CAMP AUSCHWITZ AND KIDS WATCHING THAT ON TV HAS NO IDEA WHAT THAT MEANS WE HAVE A PROBLEM ON OUR HANDS SO SIX SP SIX NINETY THREE HOPEFULLY WILL START TO TURN THE PAGE ON THIS DARK HERE OF IGNORANCE. AND WE CAN TRULY SAY NEVER AGAIN I MEAN. SENATOR BURGESS. I'D LIKE TO COMMEND- THE AUTHOR THE SENATOR FROM LOS ANGELES FOR THIS BILL- PROUD TO SERVE AS A CO AUTHOR ON THIS I THINK EVERYTHING THAT HE STATED IS THAT EDUCATION. IS PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT ELEMENT AND NOT JUST- RECOGNIZING AND COMMEMORATING. THINGS THAT HAVE OCCURRED IN THE PAST BUT PREVENTING THOSE EVENTS THAT MAY OCCUR IN THE FUTURE. SO IN ADDITION TO THE HOLOCAUST I BELIEVE THAT GENOCIDE CURRICULA- NEEDS TO- GIVE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF- OF- MATERIAL- THROUGH THE SCHOOL SYSTEM THAT WOULD INVOLVE THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE THE GREEK PONTIC GENOCIDE- CAMBODIAN THERE THE PROBLEM IS THE LIST IS LONG BUT I THINK IT'S ENTIRELY APPROPRIATE- THAT WE FORMALIZE- THIS TYPE OF EDUCATION IN- THE SCHOOL SYSTEM AND THIS IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. SO ONCE AGAIN THANK YOU TO THE SENATOR FROM LOS ANGELES PROUD TO SUPPORT THIS. SENATOR PENN. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT- CENTERS I TO RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SB SIX NINETY THREE AND- LIKE THANK MY GOOD FRIEND FROM A SAND SPRINGS FORD AND AS MY GOOD FRIEND FROM FRESNO SAID THE LIST IS TOO LONG. THIS IS VERY LONG AND UNFORTUNATELY THE LIST COULD GET LONGER IF PEOPLE DON'T REMEMBER. TO ME IT IS- I THINK AS I GET FROM LOS ANGELES POINT INCIDENTS THAT ARE HAPPENING RIGHT NOW WHICH INDICATES THAT PEOPLE HAVE- DON'T REALIZE THE SERIOUSNESS. OF WHAT HAPPENED IN THESE PAST GENOCIDES INCLUDING PARTICULARLY THE HOLOCAUST- CERTAINLY I. HAVE ALSO SEEN THIS AND HAVE BEEN APPALLED AT THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE A STORE OWNER DECIDES TO SELL YELLOW STARS- IT'S A WAY TO TRY TO MAKE A POLITICAL POINT ABOUT VACCINES NOT RECOGNIZING WHAT THAT REALLY MEANT- DURING THE HOLOCAUST DURING WORLD WAR TWO **** GERMANY. AND CERTAINLY USING OTHER SYMBOLS AS WELL AS OTHER GENOCIDES AS WELL- IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE NEVER FORGET AND WE CAN'T AND- IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT WE EDUCATE. OUR USERS HERE IN CALIFORNIA ABOUT HISTORY SO THAT WE DON'T REPEAT- THE- NOW THE STAKES AND THE HORRORS OF THE PAST. I START TO STAND STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. SENATOR NELSON. MADAM PRESIDENT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THE SENATE THIS IS A MOVING MOMENT FOR ME BASED ON MY OWN EXPERIENCE IN ISRAEL. IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE AS A PART OF AGRICULTURAL FELLOWSHIP THAT I'VE BEEN A PART OF FOR TWO YEARS WE TRAVELED INTERNATIONALLY MANY COUNTRIES. EGYPT INDIA PAKISTAN ISRAEL AND ITALY. WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME. IN ITALY WE SPENT MORE TIME. IN JERUSALEM AND TEL AVIV. IT STRUCK ME COMING INTO ISRAEL HAS. VIRTUALLY A MILITARY STATE. MILITARY EVERYWHERE. AT FIRST I KIND OF WONDERED WHY BUT I'VE DONE A LOT OF STUDYING OF MIDDLE EASTERN HISTORY. IT TOOK AROUND NINETY EIGHT NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT WHEN THE PARTITIONING OCCURRED IN. THINGS GOT PRETTY ROUGH OVER THERE. BUT THEY HAVE ALWAYS BEEN PRETTY ROUGH OVER THERE. MR STUDY ANCIENT HISTORY OF BIBLICAL HISTORY. IT'S ALWAYS BEEN A CHALLENGE WE SPENT ONE NIGHT WITH THE FAMILY. IN THEIR HOME AND A WHOLE BUNCH. THAT'S RIGHT NEXT TO TEL AVIV IN. I ASKED THE WIFE WHAT IS IT LIKE. THE LIVE ALL OF THE DAY'S. YOUR LIFE. IN A MILITARY STATE. UNDER THE CONSTANT THREATS THAT YOU LIVE UNDER. SHE HAD A VERY RESIGNED RESPONSE SHE SAID IN SOME THINGS YOU HAVE NO CHOICE. THAT GAVE ME GREAT INSIGHT. INTO THE ISRAELI PEOPLE. THIS IS ALL THE MORE IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW. AMERICA HAS ALWAYS BEEN. THAL ALLY. OF ISRAEL. BUT I SEE IN AMERICA RIGHT NOW A GREAT DIMINUTION. OF THAT SUPPORT. IN FACT IN SOME PARTS. THE DISCRIMINATION IN THIS COUNTRY. OF THE ISRAELI PEOPLE. THAT'S A VERY SAD THING TO SEE. HELLO GOOD AND NOBLE ALLY. WELL WORTHY OF OUR PROTECTION. THE HISTORY OF THAT LAND HAS BEEN SO BRUTAL. AND I GUESS I THOUGHT I KNEW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT IT TILL I WENT THERE AND TALKED TO THE PEOPLE. MANY WHO IS SERVED. IN THE NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT WAR. AND IN SUBSEQUENT CONFLICTS OVER THERE. MY APPEAL HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF THE LEGISLATION. IS BASED ON THAT PERSON'S EXPERIENCE. IN THE WORDS OF THAT WIFE AND REPUBLIC IN SOME THINGS YOU HAVE NO CHOICE. AND SOME PEOPLE WHO DO NOT DO NOT HAVE A CHOICE. I THINK I DO DESERVE OUR SUPPORT- GINGIVAL. CENTER GROVE THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT HERE IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF DOING WHAT WAS CALLED THE POPE JOHN PAUL MARGARET THATCHER REAGAN TOUR AND- THE EMPHASIS ON POPE JOHN PAUL'S PIECE WAS IN POLAND WHERE YOU WENT TO ACTUALLY- STAND AT THE BIRKENAU CAMPS A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE ABOUT US WHICH A LOT OF PEOPLE HEAR ABOUT OTHER CAMPS THAT WHEN YOU GO TO BIRKENAU IN THE HEAR THE STORIES OF- WHAT HAPPENED IN THE GENOCIDE THAT TOOK PLACE. THERE IN THE RAIL CARS THAT CAME IN AND THE. AND I WANT TO SAY IT TOTALLY RUINED OUR DAY BUT AFTER THAT YOU JUST WANTED TO GO BACK INTO SOME REALLY THINK ABOUT HOW CRUEL PEOPLE CAN BE AND WHY SOMETHING LIKE THAT COULD EVER HAPPEN IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD AND SO I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR MAKING SURE THAT THAT STUDENTS AND THE NEXT GENERATION'S NEVER FORGET WHAT HAPPENED TO OUR PEOPLE AND WHAT CONTINUES ALMOST TO THIS DAY NOT SO MUCH AS THE HOLOCAUST BUT- THE ATTACK ON THE JEWISH PEOPLE CONTINUES TODAY. AND SO I APPLAUD THE AUTHOR FOR MAKING SURE THAT OUR STUDENTS NEVER FORGET THAT THEY LEARN ABOUT IT THAT THEY MAKE SURE THAT WE PASS THE MANTLE TO THE NEXT GENERATION THAT THEY MAKE SURE THAT SOMETHING LIKE THIS NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN IN OUR WORLD AND SO THANK YOU AND ASK YOUR SUPPORT ON AN SP SIX NINETY SIX NINETY THREE. IS THERE ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. SAYING NO FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE THIS- IT IS ELIGIBLE FOR YOU UNANIMOUS ROLL CALL IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION. I THIRTY NINE NO ZERO THE MEASURE PASSES. MEMBERS ARE GOING TO GO BACK TO IBM ONE OH TWO. SENATOR ALAN IS PREPARED PLEASE READ. SENATE BILL THREE FORTY THREE BY SENATOR ALLEN AN ACT RELATING TO ENVIRONMENTAL ADVERTISING SENATOR ALLEN THE FLOOR IS YOURS THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS THIS IS A- OF SIMPLE MEASURE THAT ULTIMATELY- SAYS THAT IF YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO. CALL YOUR- PRODUCT RECYCLABLE USE THE WORDS RECYCLABLE ON YOUR- AS AN UNTRUTHFUL CLAIMS YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED US TO PUT THAT ON YOUR CONTAINER YOU SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED. TO PUT THE RECYCLING SYMBOL ON YOUR ON YOUR PRODUCT THE CHASING ARROW SYMBOL- THE SAD TRUTH MEMBERS IS THAT LESS THAN 15% OF SINGLE USE PLASTIC IS ACTUALLY RECYCLED. BUT CONSUMERS ARE DUTIFULLY FILLING THEY BELIEVE ARE RECYCLABLE. HI THIS IS WHAT WE CALL WISH CYCLING IT'S SOMETHING THAT CONTAMINATES THE RECYCLING STREAM IT ACTUALLY MAKES IT MORE COSTLY TO SORT AND CLEAN THE TRULY RECYCLED MATERIAL. MATERIAL THAT IS NOT ACTUALLY RECYCLABLE ACTUALLY HAS TO THEN BE REMOVED FROM THE CONVEYOR BELT OUT THE RECYCLING FACILITY IN CARTED AWAY. TO A LANDFILL AND IT'S REALLY IMPACTING OUR CITY'S EARLIEST CITIES JUST DID A STUDY RELEASED THIS YEAR FOUND THAT MORE THAN SEVEN OUT OF TEN CITIES ANTICIPATE INCREASING WASTE COLLECTION RATES BY AS MUCH AS TWENTY PERCENT. TO COVER THE COST OF MANAGING THE ADDITIONAL WAYS I KNOW THE COUNTY OF SACRAMENTO FOR EXAMPLE JUST RAISE THE RATES BY TEN DOLLARS. A MONTH- CONSUMERS MISTAKENLY BELIEVE THE CHASING EURO SYMBOL THE RECYCLING SYMBOL MEANS THAT THE- THAT THAT THAT THE PRODUCT IS RECYCLABLE- AND OF COURSE WE HAVE THE SYSTEM IF YOU LOOK AT ANY PLASTIC PRODUCTS AND THERE'S A- THIS RECYCLING SYMBOL IN THE MIDDLE IS A LITTLE NUMBER. AND IT BASICALLY IS A CODE FOR THE RESIN THAT IS USED. IN THE PRODUCTION OF THE PLASTIC. AND I CLASSIFIED THE PLASTIC TYPES FROM NUMBERS ONE THREE SEVEN. AND IT WAS DESIGNED AS A METHOD FOR WASTE FACILITIES TO PROPERLY SORT PLASTICS. NOT INTERESTINGLY AS A WAY TO SUGGEST. A RECYCLABILITY TO CONSUMERS GET AFTER THIRTY YEARS AND USE THE SYMBOL HAS. COME TO BE UNDERSTOOD AS THE RECYCLING SYMBOL IN FACT. SOMETIMES PRODUCT. PRODUCERS WILL JUST PUT THESE- THE RECYCLING SYMBOL ON THERE WITHOUT ANY NUMBER IN THE MIDDLE ND WHEN ASKED WHY DID YOU PUT IT ON THERE THOUGH SO WE JUST WANT TO ENCOURAGE RECYCLING. IN GENERAL. EVEN THOUGH THERE THAT PARTICULAR PRODUCT IS NOT AT ALL RECYCLABLE SO. I LOOK AT IT WE DO RECYCLING IS COMPLICATED WE KNOW THAT IT'S CONFUSING THE CONSUMER BRANDS ASSOCIATION JUST DID A STUDY. THEY FOUND OUT THE RECYCLING RANKS AHEAD OF SOME OF THE MOST CONFUSING THINGS IN LIFE FOR MOST AMERICANS. IT'S MORE CONFUSING THAN BUILDING IKEA FURNITURE MORE CONFUSING THAN THAN DOING YOUR TAXES. PLAYING THE STOCK MARKET OR UNDERSTANDING YOUR SPOUSE. SO ACCORDING TO THE STATEWIDE COMMISSION RECYCLING MARKETS IN CURBSIDE RECYCLING IS RECENT REPORT QUOTE SINCE CONSUMERS EQUATE THAT WILL RECYCLE WORD AND SYMBOL WITH WHAT IS ACCEPTED. IN CURBSIDE RECYCLING BINS TO RECYCLE WORD AND SYMBOL MUST BE RESERVED FOR MATERIALS. WHICH ARE ACCEPTED IN CURBSIDE BINS AND DO NOT CAUSE. CONTAMINATION SO OUR STATE AND FEDERAL LAW SAY THAT PRODUCERS CAN'T LIE TO CONSUMERS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT A PRETTY PRODUCT IS RECYCLABLE. THIS BILL CLARIFIES IT THAT THAT INCLUDES THE THIS INCLUDES THE CHASING ARROW SYMBOL. AND. SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE. IS THERE ANY DO. OR DEBATE. SENATOR EDMUND. IF YOU COULD JUST HOLD ON A SECOND OKAY YOUR MIKE TURNED ON. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM PRESIDENT AND- AND MEMBERS AT THAT. TIME I WRITE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL THE COMMISSION THE CENTER'S REFERRING TO A SOME LEGISLATION I DID IT A FEW YEARS AGO- TO TRY TO GET OUR HANDS AROUND THIS RECYCLING ISSUE AND- I KNOW A LOT OF YOUR CONSTITUENTS HAVE BEEN ANGRY LATELY WHEN THEY'RE- EVERYONE GETTING NOTICES THAT THEY HAVE TO DO A BETTER JOB OF. CLEANING THEIR STREAM AND EVERYONE'S ANGRY ABOUT THAT BECAUSE THEY FEEL LIKE THEY'VE BEEN FOLLOWING THE RULES BUT THEY HAVE BEEN TRICKED A LOT OF TIMES PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TRICKED INTO RULES. OUT BY BY SERVER MANUFACTURERS WHO HAPPEN. TO GET THIS ISSUE- WISH CYCLING- AND NOTHING AND SO PEOPLE ARE FEELING LIKE THEY'RE DOING THEIR VERY BEST AND NOW THEY'RE GETTING CHARGED MORE. SO HOPEFULLY AS WE INCREASE. OUR PUBLIC AWARENESS AND AS WE REALLY TRY TO HOLD MANUFACTURERS. AT TWO EIGHT AT A CONSISTENT STANDARD OF WHAT IS ACTUALLY RECYCLING AND HELP OUR CONSTITUENTS UNDERSTAND THAT. WE GET A LOT FURTHER IN HELPING REDUCE THE WASTE THAT GOES INTO OUR OUR LANDFILL SO I. WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. SEEING NONE SENATOR ALAN- SENATOR RUBIO YEAH. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE TODAY I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT AT BEST BE THREE FORTY THREE I WANT TO THANK OUR AUTHOR HERE- HE UNDERSTANDS- FIRST OF ALL THAT I HAVE READ ON AND DATA BUT YES YOU- NOTED HERE HE IS- HE HAS THE DATA HE HAS THE INFORMATION I EVEN SENT ME. A VIDEO AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I HAVE TO AGREE WITH EVERYONE IS THAT WE HAVE TO EDUCATE- FOLKS ABOUT RECYCLING AND FOR THOSE THAT DON'T NECESSARILY MAKE IT A PRACTICE TO DO SO WILL THEY TAKE THAT SIMPLE OR THAT MISLEADING- I WOULD SAY FALSE ADVERTISEMENT TO RECYCLE AND I THINK IT'S ABOUT EDUCATION COMMUNITY AWARENESS ESPECIALLY IN OUR INNER CITY COMMUNITIES WHERE WE DON'T HAVE THE TIME NECESSARY TO EDUCATE SO I THINK THIS IS A- GOOD COMMON SENSE BILL AND I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING A FORWARD THINKING. ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. SINGMAN SENATOR ALLEN YOU MAY CONCLUDE WANTED JUST THINK GRAHAM MY COLLEAGUES FOR THEIR SUPPORT AND I RESPECT FASTER THAN EVER. MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.
