BE CONDUCTED FOR COMPLETELY

01:15:38.834 --> 01:15:40.502
UNRELATED PURPOSES AND IMPACTS

THERE'VE.

01:15:41.904 --> 01:15:43.472

MANUFACTURERS WOULD AND BE

01:15:53.248 --> 01:15:55.550
FORCED TO THE DEAL WITH.

01:15:55.617 --> 01:15:57.653
AS THOUGH I DO OUT EXEMPTIONS

01:15:57.719 --> 01:16:00.355
ARE VERY VERY I'M CRAFTED IN

01:16:00.422 --> 01:16:02.391
SUCH A WAY THAT THEY ULTIMATELY

01:16:02.457 --> 01:16:04.393
EXCLUDE I'M SOME COSMETIC

01:16:04.459 --> 01:16:06.361
COMPANIES TO HAVE PERHAPS

01:16:06.428 --> 01:16:07.930
DIFFERENT PRODUCT LINES.

01:16:07.996 --> 01:16:09.431
AND AROUND KIND OF ANTI

MICROBIAL THOSE OTHER PRODUCT

01:16:11.300 --> 01:16:13.001
LINES THAT MAY BE REQUIRED TO

OUT TO HAVE SOME LEVEL OF

01:16:13.902 --> 01:16:15.370
TESTING HAVE FRAGRANCE

01:16:15.437 --> 01:16:16.672
INGREDIENTS THAT ARE TESTED FOR

01:16:16.738 --> 01:16:18.140
OTHER PURPOSES --

01:16:18.206 --> 01:16:19.775
AND SO DISADVANTAGES MANY

01:16:19.841 --> 01:16:21.476
COMPANIES THAT HAVE IT THAT HAS

01:16:21.543 --> 01:16:24.446
NO BEARING ON THE COSMETIC I IN

01:16:24.513 --> 01:16:25.814
IN QUESTION WHATSOEVER.

01:16:25.881 --> 01:16:27.883
OF FURTHER THE CONCERNS BEING

01:16:27.950 --> 01:16:29.584
THAT ON THE BROAD IMPLICATIONS

01:16:29.651 --> 01:16:30.886
FROM THE TRADE PERSPECTIVE

01:16:30.953 --> 01:16:32.988
CERTAINLY ARE NOT TO BE

01:16:33.055 --> 01:16:34.456
DISMISSED.

01:16:34.523 --> 01:16:35.691
I'M ULTIMATELY AND THE BILL

01:16:35.757 --> 01:16:37.826
HAVING SUCH SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS

01:16:37.893 --> 01:16:39.194
WILL RESULT IN --

01:16:39.261 --> 01:16:40.862
ESSENTIALLY A HUNGER GAMES

01:16:40.929 --> 01:16:42.597
SCENARIO IF YOU WILL GIVEN THAT

01:16:42.664 --> 01:16:43.799
THE REQUIREMENTS OF THOUGH NEW

01:16:43.865 --> 01:16:46.435
LANGUAGE WOULD REQUIRE A PRODUCT

01:16:46.501 --> 01:16:47.602
TO BE ON THE MARKET FOR AN

01:16:47.669 --> 01:16:48.770
ENTIRE YEAR.

01:16:48.837 --> 01:16:50.605
AND BEFORE ANY INGREDIENT TO A

01:16:50.672 --> 01:16:52.240
TESTING CAN BE CONDUCTED SO

01:16:52.307 --> 01:16:53.275
SENSUAL YOU'RE STIFLING

01:16:53.342 --> 01:16:55.978
INNOVATION ON FOR NEW PRODUCTS

01:16:56.044 --> 01:16:56.878
AND AND DEVELOPMENT OF NEW

01:16:56.945 --> 01:16:59.314
THINGS WERDEN NEW INGREDIENTS

01:16:59.381 --> 01:17:00.849
ARE ULTIMATELY KIND OF PICKED

01:17:00.916 --> 01:17:02.551
OFF ONE BY ONE BECAUSE THERE MAY

01:17:02.617 --> 01:17:03.986
BE TESTING DEMOCRATIC FOR

01:17:04.052 --> 01:17:05.554
UNRELATED PURPOSES.

01:17:05.620 --> 01:17:07.489
BUT MAYBE YOU KNOW HAVE BEARING

01:17:07.556 --> 01:17:09.658
ON NEW INNOVATION IN TERMS OF

01:17:09.725 --> 01:17:11.026
THE USE OF THOSE --

01:17:11.093 --> 01:17:12.728
ULTIMATELY AS AS JUST SECOND

01:17:12.794 --> 01:17:13.929
FROM THE PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS

01:17:13.996 --> 01:17:15.731
COUNCIL NOTED AND THE E. U.

01:17:15.797 --> 01:17:17.132
ALIGNMENTS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN

01:17:17.199 --> 01:17:19.101
SOMETHING THAT SEEMS CA AND I

01:17:19.167 --> 01:17:20.268
ITS MEMBER COMPANIES WOULD HAVE

01:17:20.335 --> 01:17:22.237
BEEN ABLE TO GET BEHIND.

01:17:22.304 --> 01:17:23.338
CERTAINLY MOVES THE NEEDLE FOR

01:17:23.405 --> 01:17:25.374
CALIFORNIA LAW MUCH FURTHER THAN

01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:27.142
WHERE WE ARE TODAY WOULD BE

01:17:27.209 --> 01:17:28.944
WORKABLE ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THE

01:17:29.011 --> 01:17:30.245
INDUSTRY IS WORKING VERY

01:17:30.312 --> 01:17:32.114
DILIGENTLY WITH CHINA TO MOVE

01:17:32.180 --> 01:17:33.982
THEM TOWARDS ALTERNATIVES TO

01:17:34.049 --> 01:17:35.217
ANIMAL TESTING AND ELIMINATE

01:17:35.283 --> 01:17:37.219
THAT BR ARE THE TESTING

01:17:37.285 --> 01:17:37.753
REQUIREMENT.

01:17:37.819 --> 01:17:39.621
BUT ULTIMATELY ONLY HAVE SO MUCH

01:17:39.688 --> 01:17:41.423
ABILITY TO IMPACT THAT AND

01:17:41.490 --> 01:17:42.758
CERTAINLY WE DON'T EXPECT THAT

01:17:42.824 --> 01:17:44.960
THAT'S GOING TO CURRENT BY

01:17:45.027 --> 01:17:45.727
TWENTY TWENTY THREE BETTER DOING

01:17:45.794 --> 01:17:46.695
SO YOU KNOW THAT ADVOCACY IN

01:17:46.762 --> 01:17:48.397
EARNEST --

01:17:48.463 --> 01:17:50.499
FURTHER THE FACT AND THAT THIS

01:17:50.565 --> 01:17:52.667
WILL ULTIMATELY HAVE AN IMPACT

01:17:52.734 --> 01:17:54.469
ON JOBS IN THE STATE AS WELL I'M

01:17:54.536 --> 01:17:56.104
IN SPEAKING AT THE OUTSET.

01:17:56.171 --> 01:17:57.239
AROUND WITH THE PROPONENTS THERE

01:17:57.305 --> 01:17:58.740
WAS DISCUSSION ABOUT WAYS TO

01:17:58.807 --> 01:17:59.841
AVOID THE CHINA TESTING

01:17:59.908 --> 01:18:01.643
REQUIREMENT WHICH WAS ULTIMATELY

01:18:01.710 --> 01:18:03.712
TO MOVE MANUFACTURING INTO THE

01:18:03.779 --> 01:18:05.313
COUNTRY TO AVOID THAT.

01:18:05.380 --> 01:18:06.314
AND FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE AS A

01:18:06.381 --> 01:18:08.483
MANUFACTURING ASSOCIATION IN

01:18:08.550 --> 01:18:10.318
CALIFORNIA THAT'S WRONG HEADED

01:18:10.385 --> 01:18:11.686
WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT JOBS

01:18:11.753 --> 01:18:13.188
HERE IN THE STATE MANUFACTURING

01:18:13.255 --> 01:18:14.389
HERE IN THE STATE OF THE

01:18:14.456 --> 01:18:16.758
TORTILLA DECLINING NOT INDUSTRY.

01:18:16.825 --> 01:18:17.859
SO THESE ARE JUST BUT A FEW OF

01:18:17.926 --> 01:18:20.429
THE CONCERN I WOULD STRONGLY

01:18:20.495 --> 01:18:21.897
RECOMMEND A NO VOTE ON THIS AND

01:18:21.963 --> 01:18:22.931
HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS

01:18:22.998 --> 01:18:25.233
THANK YOU.

01:18:25.300 --> 01:18:25.767
THANK YOU ANYWHERE ELSE IN

CHEMICAL INDUSTRY COUNCIL OF

01:18:37.512 --> 01:18:40.182
CALIFORNIA AND SUCH.

01:18:40.248 --> 01:18:41.149
I RIGHTLY ON BEHALF OF THE

01:18:41.216 --> 01:18:42.451
CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE

01:18:42.517 --> 01:18:44.152
WERE CONCERNED THAT'LL HAVE --

01:18:44.219 --> 01:18:46.188
JOB APPLICATIONS AND WE DON'T

01:18:46.254 --> 01:18:47.322
THINK GO UNDER THE CURRENT

01:18:47.389 --> 01:18:48.523
AMENDMENTS THAT ADDRESSES THE

01:18:48.590 --> 01:18:50.725
ISSUE OF TESTING FOR ANY PURPOSE

01:18:50.792 --> 01:18:53.295
THANKS THANK YOU.

01:18:53.361 --> 01:18:54.463
MARIN HIGGINS REPRESENTING BILE

01:18:54.529 --> 01:18:56.298
COME IN OPPOSITION.

I THINK NONE OF BRING IT BACK TO

01:19:00.535 --> 01:19:02.304
COMMITTEE SAID I WANNA THANK YOU.

01:19:02.370 --> 01:19:03.305
FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD

01:19:03.371 --> 01:19:08.210
AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE

01:19:08.276 --> 01:19:09.244
SOME DIFFERENCES BETWEEN WHAT

01:19:09.311 --> 01:19:10.979
THIS IS PROPOSING AND WHAT THE

01:19:11.046 --> 01:19:11.913
EUROPEAN UNION IS DOING.

01:19:11.980 --> 01:19:13.515
BUT FRANKLY.

01:19:13.582 --> 01:19:14.316
THIS IS A PRETTY LARGE MARKET

01:19:14.382 --> 01:19:16.451
CALIFORNIA.

01:19:16.518 --> 01:19:17.619
AND IF WE'RE NOT ABLE TO USE OUR

01:19:17.686 --> 01:19:20.288
MARKET PRESENCE TO SHIFT POLICY

01:19:20.355 --> 01:19:21.556
AT EVEN INTERNATIONAL POLICY WE

01:19:21.623 --> 01:19:22.424
DO THAT FROM TIME TO TIME IN

01:19:22.491 --> 01:19:24.392
THIS TO ME IS A REAL OPPORTUNITY

01:19:24.459 --> 01:19:26.528
TO DO THAT TO MOVE AWAY FROM.

01:19:26.595 --> 01:19:29.831
ALLOWING LONG STANDING.

01:19:29.898 --> 01:19:30.899
AND TO ME OBJECTIONABLE

01:19:30.966 --> 01:19:33.335
PRACTICES IN.

01:19:33.401 --> 01:19:34.536
THIS INDUSTRY AND SO I THINK

01:19:34.603 --> 01:19:36.171
THIS BILL REALLY ESTABLISHES

01:19:36.238 --> 01:19:38.874
THAT THOSE CRITERIA WE WE WORK

01:19:38.940 --> 01:19:40.175
TO TRY AND THEY APPRECIATE THE

01:19:40.242 --> 01:19:41.510
AUTHOR'S.

01:19:41.576 --> 01:19:42.811
OFFICE WORKING WITH US TO TRY

01:19:42.878 --> 01:19:44.746
AND THREAD SOME OF THESE --

01:19:44.813 --> 01:19:46.114
TWO TO A POINT BUT FROM MY

01:19:46.181 --> 01:19:47.649
STANDPOINT I THINK THE BILL AS

01:19:47.716 --> 01:19:49.251
AMENDED MEETS THIS.

01:19:49.317 --> 01:19:50.352
STANDARDS FOR THIS COMMITTEE AND

01:19:50.418 --> 01:19:51.720
I'M HOPING THAT WE WILL.

01:19:51.786 --> 01:19:54.055
MOVE IT FORWARD.

01:19:54.122 --> 01:19:56.725
KALRA THAT MR MAIENSCHEIN.

01:19:56.791 --> 01:19:58.627
I THINK WAS SHARON THANK YOU

01:19:58.693 --> 01:20:00.695
SENATOR HUB FOR BRINGING THIS

01:20:00.762 --> 01:20:01.963
BILL FORWARD --

01:20:02.030 --> 01:20:04.266
THING YOU KNOW I THINK A THE

01:20:04.332 --> 01:20:05.867
THING ABOUT COSMETICS YOU'VE

01:20:05.934 --> 01:20:07.035
PEOPLE USE COSMETICS FOR A LOT

01:20:07.102 --> 01:20:09.204
OF REASONS BUT I THINK UP OF THE

01:20:09.271 --> 01:20:10.805
PRIMARY REASONS IS THESE

01:20:10.872 --> 01:20:12.440
COSMETICS. TO LOOK GOOD AND FEEL

01:20:12.507 --> 01:20:14.709
GOOD A AND I THINK IT IS HARD TO

01:20:14.776 --> 01:20:16.411
DO THAT IF YOU KNOW THAT THE

01:20:16.478 --> 01:20:18.713
PRODUCTS ARE USING HAD THE TEST.

01:20:18.780 --> 01:20:19.915
I THINK THAT'S THE UNDERLYING

01:20:19.981 --> 01:20:21.616
CONNECT THE M. AND M. EVEN AND

01:20:21.683 --> 01:20:23.418
NOT HAD THE OPPORTUNITY NOT ONLY

01:20:23.485 --> 01:20:25.120
TO TALK TO THE FOLKS WHO SUPPORT

01:20:25.187 --> 01:20:26.488
THE BILL BUT OPPOSITION AS WELL

01:20:26.555 --> 01:20:27.956
AND I DON'T ANYONE DISAGREES

01:20:28.023 --> 01:20:28.156
THAT.

01:20:28.223 --> 01:20:30.125
ITS A POSITIVE GOAL --

01:20:30.192 --> 01:20:31.593
INCLUDING INDUSTRY OF COURSE

01:20:31.660 --> 01:20:32.794
HE'LL THAT INDEED MOVE IN THAT

01:20:32.861 --> 01:20:34.963
DIRECTION EVEN ON THEIR OWN TO

01:20:35.030 --> 01:20:35.630
IN MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION SO I

01:20:35.697 --> 01:20:36.631
THINK.

01:20:36.698 --> 01:20:38.066
I DON'T THINK THAT.

01:20:38.133 --> 01:20:40.802
AND ONCE.

01:20:40.869 --> 01:20:42.704
BUDGET ISSUES KIND OF

01:20:42.771 --> 01:20:44.673
INTERNATIONALLY AS WELL AS SOME

01:20:44.739 --> 01:20:45.607
OF THE RESTRICTIONS ON I GET AND

01:20:45.674 --> 01:20:47.542
I GET I ET THAT.

01:20:47.609 --> 01:20:49.911
I'M BUT I DO THINK THAT.

01:20:49.978 --> 01:20:52.147
AS TO THE CHAIR'S POINT LOOK.

01:20:52.214 --> 01:20:54.316
IF IF CALIFORNIA THE FIFTH

01:20:54.382 --> 01:20:55.817
LARGEST CALM THE WORLD --

01:20:55.884 --> 01:20:57.686
JOINS FORTY OTHER NATIONS SUB IT

01:20:57.752 --> 01:20:59.621
WOULD BE AMONGST THE LARGEST

01:20:59.688 --> 01:21:00.088
NATION JOINING IN THAT

01:21:00.155 --> 01:21:02.924
PARTNERSHIP --

01:21:02.991 --> 01:21:04.192
IF YOU HAVE TO SAY THAT NO

01:21:04.259 --> 01:21:05.493
ANIMAL TESTING IS IS NOT

01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:06.461
ACCEPTABLE.

01:21:06.528 --> 01:21:08.196
THAT IS WHAT.

01:21:08.263 --> 01:21:10.198
MOVES THE NATIONS LIKE CHINA AND

01:21:10.265 --> 01:21:12.567
OTHERS THAT'S WHAT CREATES THE

01:21:12.634 --> 01:21:14.336
MOMENTUM IN MY OPINION --

01:21:14.402 --> 01:21:16.004
IT TO REALLY CREATE

01:21:16.071 --> 01:21:16.771
INTERNATIONAL CHANGE ON THE

01:21:16.838 --> 01:21:17.606
ISSUE.

01:21:17.672 --> 01:21:19.274
A CRUELTY FREE COSMETICS ARE ARE

01:21:19.341 --> 01:21:21.509
NOT A NOVELTY --

01:21:21.576 --> 01:21:22.477
I THINK IT'S MORE MORE

01:21:22.544 --> 01:21:24.546
UBIQUITOUS IN CALIFORNIA AND AND

01:21:24.613 --> 01:21:26.047
THROUGHOUT THE WORLD --

01:21:26.114 --> 01:21:27.916
AND AND I DO APPRECIATE THE

01:21:27.983 --> 01:21:29.317
AUTHOR --

01:21:29.384 --> 01:21:31.920
INCLUDING THE THE EXEMPTION TO

01:21:31.987 --> 01:21:33.888
LIMIT EXEMPTS OF ANIMAL TESTING

01:21:33.955 --> 01:21:35.390
FOR NON COSMETIC PURPOSES NOW MY

01:21:35.457 --> 01:21:37.259
GUESS IS THAT A AND AND BASED

01:21:37.325 --> 01:21:39.227
UPON THAT THE TESTIMONY THAT.

01:21:39.294 --> 01:21:41.496
DOESN'T SAY SATISFIED OPPOSITION

01:21:41.563 --> 01:21:42.063
BUT I DO THINK THAT'S A GOOD

01:21:42.130 --> 01:21:43.098
FAITH.

01:21:43.164 --> 01:21:46.001
I'M AMENDMENT ADMIT TO RECOGNIZE --

01:21:46.067 --> 01:21:48.436
THAN THAT THE GOAL HERE AYE IS

01:21:48.503 --> 01:21:51.172
NOT TO SHUT DOWN COMPANIES --

01:21:51.239 --> 01:21:53.575
BECAUSE OF SOME CHEMICAL THAT

01:21:53.642 --> 01:21:54.643
HAPPENS TO BE IN ONE OF THE

01:21:54.709 --> 01:21:56.311
PRODUCTS IS BEING USED FOR

01:21:56.378 --> 01:21:57.812
SOMETHING IN HIM THAT I THE IDEA

01:21:57.879 --> 01:21:58.980
HERE IS RELATED TRIED NEARLY

01:21:59.047 --> 01:22:00.382
FOCUS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.

01:22:00.448 --> 01:22:02.584
MY GUESS IS THAT THAT THE OPTION

01:22:02.651 --> 01:22:04.552
BY BILLS COULD BE DONE THAT BE

01:22:04.619 --> 01:22:05.654
MORE WORK DONE ON THAT AND

01:22:05.720 --> 01:22:07.589
THAT'S PART OF THE PROCESS.

01:22:07.656 --> 01:22:09.891
OF IS TO CONTINUE THE TO HAVE

01:22:09.958 --> 01:22:12.193
DIALOGUE AND CONTINUE TO WORK --

01:22:12.260 --> 01:22:14.029
AND NO LONG TERM.

01:22:14.095 --> 01:22:15.997
IN TERMS OF THIS MOVEMENT AT THE

01:22:16.064 --> 01:22:18.533
I DON'T BELIEVE THE GOAL IS TO

01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:20.001
FIND A WAY TO COEXIST WITH

01:22:20.068 --> 01:22:21.903
ANIMAL TESTED COSMETICS LONG

01:22:21.970 --> 01:22:23.438
TERM THE GOAL IS TO ELIMINATE

01:22:23.505 --> 01:22:24.839
ANIMAL TESTED COSMETICS ON THE

01:22:24.906 --> 01:22:26.374
PLANET.

01:22:26.441 --> 01:22:29.177
AND THAT HAPPENS WHEN I'M WITH

01:22:29.244 --> 01:22:31.012
WHEN WE ARE BOLD ABOUT IT AND I

01:22:31.079 --> 01:22:33.248
DO THINK THAT THE EU WAS BORED

01:22:33.315 --> 01:22:34.282
WHEN THEY WENT FORWARD AND I

01:22:34.349 --> 01:22:35.583
THINK THAT --

01:22:35.650 --> 01:22:37.085
YOU KNOW CERTAINLY THIS ISN'T AN

01:22:37.152 --> 01:22:40.021
EVEN BOLDER STEP TO SOME EXTENT

01:22:40.088 --> 01:22:42.357
BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S A IT'S

01:22:42.424 --> 01:22:44.492
IT'S GOING THAT FAR.

01:22:44.559 --> 01:22:48.063
OF ONE OF FAR ALONG --

01:22:48.129 --> 01:22:49.564
TO AB YOU ATTEMPT TO BE AS

01:22:49.631 --> 01:22:52.334
DAMAGING TO THE INDUSTRY AS AS

01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:53.168
THEIR AS THE FEARS THAT IT

01:22:53.234 --> 01:22:53.735
DIDN'T.

01:22:53.802 --> 01:22:55.804
OUTLINED OTHERS FOUR AND HALF

01:22:55.870 --> 01:22:57.305
YEARS TO A TO WORK. TO TRY TO

MOVE CONTINUE TO MOVE CHINA IN

01:22:59.174 --> 01:23:00.542
THE RIGHT DIRECTION RATHER THAN

01:23:00.608 --> 01:23:01.609
HAVING TO GET EXEMPTIONS BY

01:23:01.676 --> 01:23:03.645

01:23:03.712 --> 01:23:04.479
LIKE A VERY.

01:23:04.546 --> 01:23:05.480
KIND OF INEFFICIENT WAY OF DOING

01:23:05.547 --> 01:23:06.881

ULTIMATELY IT'S GOING TO COME TO

01:25:52.814 --> 01:25:54.215
POINT WHERE THIS ISN'T EVEN

01:25:54.282 --> 01:25:55.550
GOING TO BE AN ISSUE --

01:25:55.617 --> 01:25:57.252

01:27:17.198 --> 01:27:20.134
OF A FIVE YEAR PERIOD. FOR

01:27:20.201 --> 01:27:21.369
BEFORE IT REALLY TAKES EFFECT IN

01:27:21.436 --> 01:27:23.104
ANY SORT OF TOTAL BAN WOULD

01:27:23.171 --> 01:27:24.906
WOULD.

01:27:24.973 --> 01:27:26.908
WOULD TAKE EFFECT SO.

01:27:26.975 --> 01:27:28.810
THAT SEEMS TO BE TO ME TO

01:27:28.876 --> 01:27:30.211
MITIGATE THE POTENTIAL IMPACT ON

01:27:30.278 --> 01:27:31.646
JOBS.

01:27:31.713 --> 01:27:33.147
BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT A PHASE IN

01:27:33.214 --> 01:27:36.551
PERIOD ONE AND TWO IT GIVES US

01:27:36.618 --> 01:27:38.219
FIVE YEARS TO MAYBE --

01:27:38.286 --> 01:27:39.921
PUT THIS INTO THE THE

01:27:39.988 --> 01:27:42.323
INTERNATIONAL RENEGOTIATION OF

01:27:42.390 --> 01:27:44.325
TRADE ISSUES TYPE POTENTIAL USE

01:27:44.392 --> 01:27:46.661
AS THE I CHAIR RIGHTLY POINTED

01:27:46.728 --> 01:27:48.863
OUT USE ARE SIGNIFICANT MARKET

01:27:48.930 --> 01:27:50.398
POWER IN CALIFORNIA.

01:27:50.465 --> 01:27:52.166
TOOK PERHAPS PUSH --

01:27:52.233 --> 01:27:55.136
THAT COUNTRY IN A CRUELTY FREE

01:27:55.203 --> 01:27:57.538
DIRECTION SO COULD I JUST LIKE

01:27:57.605 --> 01:27:59.674
MAYBE A RESPONSE FROM BOTH OF YA

01:27:59.741 --> 01:28:01.409
ABSOLUTE AS A AT SOMEONE AND

01:28:01.476 --> 01:28:02.710
THINK YOU FOR THE QUESTION I

01:28:02.777 --> 01:28:03.878
APPRECIATE THAT.

01:28:03.945 --> 01:28:05.313
I THINK IT CONVERTS TO FULL NOT

01:28:05.380 --> 01:28:07.248
ONLY RELATIVE TO THE CHINA

01:28:07.315 --> 01:28:08.816
EXEMPTION AND SUNSET DATE THERE

01:28:08.883 --> 01:28:10.284
BUT ALSO THE LANGUAGE AROUND THE

01:28:10.351 --> 01:28:11.786
TESTING FOR ANY PURPOSE.

01:28:11.853 --> 01:28:13.454
AND TRYING TO KIND OF ADDRESS

01:28:13.521 --> 01:28:14.656
THAT ISSUE.

01:28:14.722 --> 01:28:16.491
RELATIVE TO THE CHINA SUNSET

01:28:16.557 --> 01:28:19.227
DATE WE HAVE A GUN NO ASSURANCES

01:28:19.293 --> 01:28:21.262
THAT HOW CHINA WILL MOVE AWAY

01:28:21.329 --> 01:28:23.197
FROM THE REQUIREMENTS AROUND TOO

01:28:23.264 --> 01:28:25.099
YOU KNOW REQUIRING DOT COMPANIES

01:28:25.166 --> 01:28:27.435
THAT WANT TO SELL INTO THE

01:28:27.502 --> 01:28:28.369
CHINESE MARKET TOWN WILL TEST.

01:28:28.436 --> 01:28:29.303
THERE'S NO DATE CERTAIN

01:28:29.370 --> 01:28:30.638
CERTAINLY THE INDUSTRY IS

01:28:30.705 --> 01:28:31.973
LOBBYING AND I'M TRYING TO

01:28:32.040 --> 01:28:33.708
EDUCATE THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT

01:28:33.775 --> 01:28:35.343
AND PUSHING FOR THEM TO

01:28:35.410 --> 01:28:37.879
ELIMINATE THOSE REQUIREMENTS

01:28:37.945 --> 01:28:38.513
TWENTY TWENTY THREE THERE'S NO

01:28:38.579 --> 01:28:40.114
CERTAINTY AND NOT FOR THESE

01:28:40.181 --> 01:28:41.049
COMPANIES.

01:28:41.115 --> 01:28:43.217
AND SO YOU KNOW WHEN COMPANIES

01:28:43.284 --> 01:28:44.585
ARE FACED WITH THE KNOW THAT

01:28:44.652 --> 01:28:45.720
DECIDING TO HAVE TO DECIDE

01:28:45.787 --> 01:28:47.088
WHETHER TO SELL INTO THE CHINESE

01:28:47.155 --> 01:28:47.789
MARKET.

01:28:47.855 --> 01:28:49.557
ORINDA CALIFORNIA THE CHINESE

01:28:49.624 --> 01:28:51.559
MARKET IS A LARGER MARKET THAN

01:28:51.626 --> 01:28:53.127
CALIFORNIA SO THAT THAT'S IT A

01:28:53.194 --> 01:28:54.395
CHALLENGING.

01:28:54.462 --> 01:28:56.831
DECISION TO MAKE AND SO YOU KNOW

01:28:56.898 --> 01:28:57.932
WHEN YOU'RE FORCE WITH HAVING TO

01:28:57.999 --> 01:28:58.833
MAKE THAT TYPE OF DECISION TO

01:28:58.900 --> 01:29:00.435
SPECIFICALLY RELATIVE TO THAT

01:29:00.501 --> 01:29:01.402
REQUIREMENT.

01:29:01.469 --> 01:29:02.937
YOU KNOW IS IT DOES IT MAKE MORE

01:29:03.004 --> 01:29:04.639
SENSE TO BE ABLE TO DO BOTH CHIU

01:29:04.706 --> 01:29:06.841
UP AND MOVE YOUR JOBS INTO CHINA

01:29:06.908 --> 01:29:07.909
TO AVOID THAT TESTING

01:29:07.975 --> 01:29:09.577
REQUIREMENT IS CHINA. FOR THOSE

01:29:09.644 --> 01:29:11.212
COMPANIES THAT ARE MANUFACTURING

01:29:11.279 --> 01:29:13.981
IN COUNTRY VERY THEY DON'T HAVE

01:29:14.048 --> 01:29:15.783
TO ABIDE BY THAT PARTICULAR

01:29:15.850 --> 01:29:17.318
TESTING REQUIREMENT SO UPS AND

01:29:17.385 --> 01:29:18.619
IT BASICALLY FORCES A

01:29:18.686 --> 01:29:19.854
MANUFACTURER.

01:29:19.921 --> 01:29:20.722
CHAPTER DECIDE TO MOVE THEIR

01:29:20.788 --> 01:29:23.324
MENU.

01:29:23.391 --> 01:29:25.893
FROM CALIFORNIA INTO CHINA TO

01:29:25.960 --> 01:29:27.295
AVOID THAT TESTING REQUIREMENT

01:29:27.361 --> 01:29:29.597
IT THAT TWENTY TWENTY THREE DAY

01:29:29.664 --> 01:29:30.565
COMES AND GOES AND THE CHINESE

01:29:30.631 --> 01:29:32.200
GOVERNMENT HAVE ELIMINATED THAT

01:29:32.266 --> 01:29:34.535
WERE TESTING REQUIREMENT IMPORT.

01:29:34.602 --> 01:29:35.803
THAT'S THE PREDICAMENT

01:29:35.870 --> 01:29:37.705
MANUFACTURERS WHO WHO SELL INTO

01:29:37.772 --> 01:29:38.973
THE CHINESE MARKET WILL FIND

01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:40.875
THEMSELVES AND RELATIVE TO THE

01:29:40.942 --> 01:29:43.144
NEW LANGUAGE US AS PROPOSED.

01:29:43.211 --> 01:29:44.846
AND THE CHALLENGE WITH THIS IS

01:29:44.912 --> 01:29:47.749
THAT FOR SOME COMPANIES --

01:29:47.815 --> 01:29:49.884
WHO MAY BE INVOLVED AND KIND OF

01:29:49.951 --> 01:29:52.286
HAD MULTIPLE PRODUCTS SECTOR ON

01:29:52.353 --> 01:29:54.188
A LINES I YOU KNOW SON YOU KNOW

01:29:54.255 --> 01:29:56.023
MADE YOU ARE INTO YOU THROUGH

01:29:56.090 --> 01:29:57.058
YOU KNOW I'M?

01:29:57.125 --> 01:29:59.026
KIND OF LIFE SCIENCES WORK AND

01:29:59.093 --> 01:30:00.795
SO IS PART OF THAT WORK WHETHER

01:30:00.862 --> 01:30:02.330
BE YOU KNOW FOR PHARMACEUTICAL

01:30:02.396 --> 01:30:04.098
DEVELOPMENT JUST ARE IN DE

01:30:04.165 --> 01:30:05.733
RELATED TO YOU KNOW OTHER GREEN

01:30:05.800 --> 01:30:08.569
CHEMISTRY RELATED PURPOSES.

01:30:08.636 --> 01:30:09.604
ULTIMATELY IF THE IF A

01:30:09.670 --> 01:30:10.805
MANUFACTURER A COSMETIC BECAUSE

01:30:10.872 --> 01:30:12.940
THE COSMETIC LINE ALSO HAS A

01:30:13.007 --> 01:30:15.376
SUBSIDIARY THAT'S ALSO DOING

01:30:15.443 --> 01:30:16.811
KIND ARE IN DIFFERENT WITHOUT

01:30:16.878 --> 01:30:19.046
WHATEVER YOU KNOW OTHER INDUSTRY

01:30:19.113 --> 01:30:20.782
SECTOR PRODUCT PURPOSE.

01:30:20.848 --> 01:30:21.716
THEY WOULD BE OF THEIR POT

01:30:21.783 --> 01:30:22.984
COSMETIC PRODUCTS WOULD BE

01:30:23.050 --> 01:30:24.619
BANNED UNDER THIS LANGUAGE

01:30:24.685 --> 01:30:26.187
FURTHER IF A COMPANY YOU KNOW

01:30:26.254 --> 01:30:27.922
PERHAPS HAS --

01:30:27.989 --> 01:30:29.457
OTHER PRODUCT LINES THAT YOU

01:30:29.524 --> 01:30:30.691
KNOW OUR DISINFECTANTS

01:30:30.758 --> 01:30:32.426
DISINFECTANTS YOU KNOW THE TERMS

01:30:32.493 --> 01:30:34.362
OF KIND OF HER CONSIDERED A

01:30:34.428 --> 01:30:35.296
PESTICIDE BASED ON THAT THIS

01:30:35.363 --> 01:30:36.964
ANTI MICROBIAL DISINFECTANT

01:30:37.031 --> 01:30:37.932
PROPERTIES.

01:30:37.999 --> 01:30:40.101
ARE REQUIRED AS PART OF THE USE

01:30:40.168 --> 01:30:42.136
OF THOSE PRODUCTS TO CONDUCT

01:30:42.203 --> 01:30:43.871
TESTING FOR THE PURPOSES OF

01:30:43.938 --> 01:30:45.239
MAKING SURE THAT THOSE

01:30:45.306 --> 01:30:46.440
DISINFECTANTS ACTUALLY KILLED

01:30:46.507 --> 01:30:47.875
THE THE BY TEARING OF THE

01:30:47.942 --> 01:30:49.110
VIRUSES.

01:30:49.177 --> 01:30:49.977
VETERAN QUESTION THAT'S THEIR

01:30:50.044 --> 01:30:52.346
INTENDED PURPOSE SO ULTIMATELY

01:30:52.413 --> 01:30:54.782
THAT TYPE OF COMPANY ALSO WOULD

01:30:54.849 --> 01:30:56.584
HAVE THEIR COSMETIC SUBSIDIARY

01:30:56.651 --> 01:30:57.919
AND THEIR PRODUCTS BEYOND

01:30:57.985 --> 01:30:59.053
BECAUSE UNDER THIS LANGUAGE.

01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:01.756
IT MEANS S. TO LIMIT THAT YOU

01:31:01.823 --> 01:31:03.858
KNOW TESTING FOR ANY PURPOSE BUT

01:31:03.925 --> 01:31:05.293
IT DISADVANTAGES THOSE COMPANIES

01:31:05.359 --> 01:31:06.761
HAVE MAY HAVE SOME YOU KNOW

01:31:06.828 --> 01:31:07.862
MULTI SECTOR LINES IN

01:31:07.929 --> 01:31:09.831
MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS HERE IN

01:31:09.897 --> 01:31:10.464
THE STATE.

01:31:10.531 --> 01:31:11.699
SO THOSE ARE JUST A COUPLE OF

01:31:11.766 --> 01:31:13.401
EXAMPLES ABOUT HOW THEY'D THEY

01:31:13.467 --> 01:31:16.003
WOULD HAVE TRUE CALIFORNIA JOB

01:31:16.070 --> 01:31:17.405
IMPACTS TO AND THOSE ARE BUT

01:31:17.471 --> 01:31:19.640
JUST A COUPLE OF OF EXAMPLES OF

01:31:19.707 --> 01:31:22.443
OF REAL LIFE IMPLICATIONS.

01:31:22.510 --> 01:31:23.978
COULD I GET A RESPONSE YET

01:31:24.045 --> 01:31:26.848
PARTLY YES SO WHAT WHAT.

01:31:26.914 --> 01:31:28.216
THESE ARGUMENTS WERE BROUGHT UP

01:31:28.282 --> 01:31:30.718
DURING THE U. EUROPEAN UNION --

01:31:30.785 --> 01:31:32.253
HEARINGS ALL THE SAME TYPE OF

01:31:32.320 --> 01:31:34.455
ARGUMENTS AND WHAT HAPPENED WITH

01:31:34.522 --> 01:31:36.691
JOBS IS JOBS GREW AND HERE'S

01:31:36.757 --> 01:31:39.527
WHERE JOBS GROW WHICH WE LOVE IS

01:31:39.594 --> 01:31:41.262
IN THE TECH INDUSTRY.

01:31:41.329 --> 01:31:43.097
MEETING THESE REQUIREMENTS OF

01:31:43.164 --> 01:31:45.433
ALL THESE NEW ALTERNATIVE TEST

01:31:45.499 --> 01:31:48.269
AND OPENING IT UP WHEN I DID OUR

01:31:48.336 --> 01:31:50.371
DUE DILIGENCE ON THIS BILL.

01:31:50.438 --> 01:31:52.206
AND TALKING TO COMPANIES LIKE

01:31:52.273 --> 01:31:53.541
LIFE AND JOHN PAUL MITCHELL

01:31:53.608 --> 01:31:55.643
SYSTEMS JOHN PAUL MITCHELL

01:31:55.710 --> 01:31:57.345
SYSTEMS LIKE I SAID THEIR

01:31:57.411 --> 01:31:58.813
INCEPTION THIRTY EIGHT YEARS AGO

01:31:58.880 --> 01:32:00.481
CRUELTY FREE.

01:32:00.548 --> 01:32:02.817
THEY WANTED TO BE IN CHINA RIGHT.

01:32:02.884 --> 01:32:06.621
AND SO THEY SAID HOW.

01:32:06.687 --> 01:32:07.922
AND THE CHINESE REGULATORS

01:32:07.989 --> 01:32:10.024
WORKED WITH THEM.

01:32:10.091 --> 01:32:12.560
ON A TEST THAT'S OUT OF BOSTON

01:32:12.627 --> 01:32:15.162
THAT COMPANY IS CALLED MAY TECH.

01:32:15.229 --> 01:32:17.765
AND THAT CHINESE REGULATORS SAID

01:32:17.832 --> 01:32:19.000
THE SOUL SATISFY OUR

01:32:19.066 --> 01:32:21.602
REQUIREMENTS THEY NOW.

01:32:21.669 --> 01:32:24.639
ARE MOVING ALL THEIR SKEWS YES

01:32:24.705 --> 01:32:25.306
THEY'RE GOING THROUGH THE

01:32:25.373 --> 01:32:28.342
PROCESS YES IT WAS A BY DEFAULT

01:32:28.409 --> 01:32:29.710
BUT WHEN JOHN PAUL MITCHELL

01:32:29.777 --> 01:32:31.412
SYSTEMS SAID HEY.

01:32:31.479 --> 01:32:33.014
WE WANT TO STAY CRUELTY FREE THE

01:32:33.080 --> 01:32:34.448
CHINESE REGULATORS MADE IT

01:32:34.515 --> 01:32:37.184
HAPPEN SO YOU GROW JOBS BECAUSE

01:32:37.251 --> 01:32:39.587
A WILL BE THE LEADER AND CRUELTY

01:32:39.654 --> 01:32:40.254
FREE.

01:32:40.321 --> 01:32:42.223
SO OF COURSE MORE COMPANIES WILL

01:32:42.290 --> 01:32:44.225
FLOURISH BY CHANGING THEIR

01:32:44.292 --> 01:32:45.927
PRODUCT LINES THEY'RE GONNA SELL

01:32:45.993 --> 01:32:47.828
MORE PRODUCT BECAUSE PEOPLE WANT

01:32:47.895 --> 01:32:49.563
TO BUY CRUELTY FREE.

01:32:49.630 --> 01:32:51.532
AND THEN THE TECH SECTOR ALL

01:32:51.599 --> 01:32:54.735
ALSO GROWS WITH THIS SO YOU KNOW

01:32:54.802 --> 01:32:56.537
YES THERE'S TEST ON THE MARKET

01:32:56.604 --> 01:32:58.506
YES WE HAVE PLENTY TO USE THAT

01:32:58.572 --> 01:33:00.741
ARE SAFER THAN THE ANIMAL TESTS.

01:33:00.808 --> 01:33:02.677
BUT THAT MARKET WILL GROW AND IT

01:33:02.743 --> 01:33:05.179
WILL KEEP MOVING SO YOU KNOW WE

01:33:05.246 --> 01:33:06.914
FIND THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF RED

01:33:06.981 --> 01:33:09.250
HERRINGS A THAT HAVE BEEN

01:33:09.317 --> 01:33:10.451
PRESENTED.

01:33:10.518 --> 01:33:12.753
AND THAT WE CAN'T JUSTIFY THESE

01:33:12.820 --> 01:33:14.722
ARGUMENTS AND THESE ARGUMENTS

01:33:14.789 --> 01:33:17.191
WERE MADE ONCE UPON A TIME YEARS

01:33:17.258 --> 01:33:19.427
AGO WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION AND

01:33:19.493 --> 01:33:20.461
THEY HAVE BEEN FLESHED OUT.

01:33:20.528 --> 01:33:24.632
SO THAT IS MY RESPONSE --

01:33:24.699 --> 01:33:26.100
AND ALI BABA HOW SORRY ONE MORE

01:33:26.167 --> 01:33:28.636
THAT YOU WANT TO COVER ALI BABA

01:33:28.703 --> 01:33:29.770
AND I THINK BUT WHO THE HECK.

01:33:29.837 --> 01:33:30.438
I THINK THAT DOES THAT ANSWER

01:33:30.504 --> 01:33:32.707
YOUR QUESTION OR TO EXPLORE THAT

01:33:32.773 --> 01:33:34.809
FURTHER PAGES LOTUS IF YOU HAD.

01:33:34.875 --> 01:33:35.876
AND A BRIEF ADDITIONAL YEAH

01:33:35.943 --> 01:33:36.877
BRIEFLY I WE WERE JUST GOING TO

01:33:36.944 --> 01:33:38.546
MENTION THAT THERE THE ON THE

01:33:38.612 --> 01:33:40.281
LARGEST ONLINE RETAILER ALIBABA

01:33:40.348 --> 01:33:41.782
DOT COM COMPANIES CAN UTILIZE

01:33:41.849 --> 01:33:43.451
THAT TO REACH THE ENTIRE CHINESE

01:33:43.517 --> 01:33:44.752
MARKET AS WELL.

01:33:44.819 --> 01:33:46.988
AND HONG KONG ALSO HAS AN

01:33:47.054 --> 01:33:48.389
ENTIRELY DIFFERENT SET OF

01:33:48.456 --> 01:33:49.390
REGULATIONS AS THE REST OF THE

01:35:05.766 --> 01:35:07.668
THE BILL ITSELF THEN.

01:35:07.735 --> 01:35:09.804

UNDER CURRENT LAW AS SENATOR WAS

01:48:38.578 --> 01:48:39.813
SO SAID THERE REALLY ISN'T

01:48:39.880 --> 01:48:42.215
CLARITY WHETHER SMALL CLAIMS ARE

01:48:42.282 --> 01:48:44.217
ACTUALLY PROCEEDINGS FOR THE

01:48:50.290 --> 01:48:51.258
THAT.

01:48:51.324 --> 01:48:52.859
THIS LACK OF CLARITY HAS

01:48:52.926 --> 01:48:54.961
RESULTED IN A PATCHWORK OF

01:48:55.028 --> 01:48:56.296
INFORMAL AN INCONSISTENT

01:48:56.363 --> 01:48:57.864

SMALL CLAIMS LITIGANTS.

01:49:08.909 --> 01:49:10.810
CURRENTLY THERE'S AN UNFORTUNATE

01:49:10.877 --> 01:49:12.178
SHORTAGE OF INTERPRETERS

01:49:12.245 --> 01:49:13.747

01:49:37.537 --> 01:49:40.040

01:49:40.106 --> 01:49:47.347
THE PRECEDING HAD TO BE DELAYED --

01:49:47.414 --> 01:49:49.983
OUR EXPERIENCE IS UP

01:49:50.050 --> 01:49:51.318
UNFORTUNATELY THAT MANY

01:49:51.384 --> 01:49:53.954
LITIGANTS AREN'T GOING TO RETURN

01:49:54.020 --> 01:49:56.323

FAITH FOR THOSE OF US WHO WORK

IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS THAT

01:51:06.026 --> 01:51:07.260
WE DON'T MAKE THE PERFECT THE

01:51:07.327 --> 01:51:08.561
ENEMY OF THE GOOD.

01:51:08.628 --> 01:51:10.797
BUT UNFORTUNATELY THIS BILL IS

01:51:10.864 --> 01:51:12.298
NOT THE GOOD AND I WANT.

01:51:12.365 --> 01:51:14.701
TO THANK THE COMMITTEE AND ON

01:51:14.768 --> 01:51:16.302
THE DEDICATION OF COMMITTEE

01:51:16.369 --> 01:51:17.904
COUNSEL NICOLETTE QUE FOUNDED

01:51:17.971 --> 01:51:19.539
AMENDMENTS MAKE IT HARDER FOR

01:51:19.606 --> 01:51:22.142
THE COURTS. TO DENY AN

01:51:22.208 --> 01:51:23.443
INTERPRETER BUT THEY DON'T

01:51:23.510 --> 01:51:25.078
PROHIBIT THE COURTS FROM DENYING

01:51:25.145 --> 01:51:26.312
INTERPRETER AND THAT

01:51:26.379 --> 01:51:27.981
UNFORTUNATELY IS THE PROBLEM

01:51:28.048 --> 01:51:31.651
BECAUSE ANYONE WHO HAS LOOKED AT

01:51:31.718 --> 01:51:32.886
THIS BODY OF LAW [inaudible]

01:51:32.952 --> 01:51:34.754
AGREES.

01:51:34.821 --> 01:51:37.590
THAT AN INTERPRETER IS REQUIRED.

01:51:37.657 --> 01:51:40.293
ALL COURT PROCEEDINGS.

01:51:40.360 --> 01:51:41.294
AND THERE'S REALLY NO DISPUTE

01:51:41.361 --> 01:51:42.695
ABOUT THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:51:42.762 --> 01:51:43.696
JUSTICE HAS BEEN ABSOLUTELY

01:51:43.763 --> 01:51:44.931
CLEAR ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS ACROSS

01:51:44.998 --> 01:51:46.399
THE COUNTRY.

01:51:46.466 --> 01:51:48.435
JUDICIAL COUNCIL ITSELF.

01:51:48.501 --> 01:51:49.102
HAS --

01:51:49.169 --> 01:51:51.271
ACKNOWLEDGED.

01:51:51.337 --> 01:51:53.840
THAT THAT'S ITS OBLIGATION

01:51:53.907 --> 01:51:54.140
[inaudible]

01:51:54.207 --> 01:51:58.445
AND THE ACTIVITY ANALYSIS I

01:51:58.511 --> 01:52:01.347
THINK REFLECTS THAT LAW SO IT'S

01:52:01.414 --> 01:52:02.782
IMPORTANT I THINK THAT THE MOOD

01:52:02.849 --> 01:52:03.883
IN A JUDICIAL COUNCIL HAS OPTED

01:52:03.950 --> 01:52:06.019
TO SPONSOR A BILL THAT CONFLICTS

01:52:06.086 --> 01:52:07.620
WITH THAT VERY CLEAR OBLIGATION.

01:52:07.687 --> 01:52:09.289
ON TEN YEARS AGO THE JUDICIAL

01:52:09.355 --> 01:52:12.959
COUNCIL KILLED EFFORTS --

01:52:13.026 --> 01:52:14.360
TO ENACT --

01:52:14.427 --> 01:52:17.730
I INTERPRETER EXPANSION AND IN

01:52:17.797 --> 01:52:19.499
CIVIL CASES IT USED THE VERY

01:52:19.566 --> 01:52:20.100
SAME ARGUMENTS THAT IT'S USING

01:52:20.166 --> 01:52:22.268
TODAY.

01:52:22.335 --> 01:52:23.736
CATCH IT WOULD BE TOO COSTLY THE

01:52:23.803 --> 01:52:25.638
INTERPRETERS AREN'T THERE EXCEPT.

01:52:25.705 --> 01:52:27.841
FOR WHAT IF PHONE.

01:52:27.907 --> 01:52:29.709
UNDER THOMPSON PRESSURE FROM THE

01:52:29.776 --> 01:52:30.810
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE UNDER

01:52:30.877 --> 01:52:32.278
BECAUSE THAT INVESTIGATION IS

01:52:32.345 --> 01:52:35.281
ONGOING IS THAT IN FACT IT COULD.

01:52:35.348 --> 01:52:37.984
AND IN FACT 80% OF THE SMALL

01:52:38.051 --> 01:52:39.486
CLAIMS COURTS INDEED ARE ALREADY

01:52:39.552 --> 01:52:41.821
PROVIDING.

01:52:41.888 --> 01:52:42.856
INTERPRETERS IN SMALL CLAIMS

01:52:42.922 --> 01:52:45.258
COURT HAS OF EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO

01:52:45.325 --> 01:52:46.025
SYZYGY DOCUMENT FROM THE

01:52:46.092 --> 01:52:47.594
JUDICIAL COUNCIL INDICATING THAT

01:52:47.660 --> 01:52:49.963
AS OF DECEMBER --

01:52:50.029 --> 01:52:51.764
OF TWENTY SIXTEEN EIGHTEEN

01:52:51.831 --> 01:52:53.233
MONTHS AGO ON THE COURTS WERE

01:52:53.299 --> 01:52:54.834
ALREADY PROVIDING --

01:52:54.901 --> 01:52:56.236
INTERPRETERS IN SMALL CLAIMS

01:52:56.302 --> 01:52:58.671
CASES AND 80% OF THE COURTS SO

01:52:58.738 --> 01:53:01.007
THIS ACTUALLY SETS US BACK.

01:53:01.074 --> 01:53:02.008
BY SAYING THAT THE COURTS DON'T

01:53:02.075 --> 01:53:03.743
HAVE TO DO WHAT THEY'RE ALREADY

01:53:03.810 --> 01:53:06.146
DOING -- THE

01:53:06.212 --> 01:53:08.114
ALLEN.

01:53:08.181 --> 01:53:12.018
YOU KNOW IT'S IT.

01:53:12.085 --> 01:53:14.954
IT IS CENTER DOESN'T MATTER.

01:53:15.021 --> 01:53:16.956
WHAT WE DO WITH THIS BILL THE

01:53:17.023 --> 01:53:18.858
LEGISLATURE CAN ENACT ON THIS

01:53:18.925 --> 01:53:20.293
STATUTE TO SAY THAT INTERPRETERS

01:53:20.360 --> 01:53:21.794
ARE NOT REQUIRE THAT THE

01:53:21.861 --> 01:53:22.128
DISCRETIONARY?

01:53:22.195 --> 01:53:25.532
ON THAT ON THEY THEY MAY NOT BE

01:53:25.598 --> 01:53:28.468
NECESSARY BUT THAT WILL NOT

01:53:28.535 --> 01:53:29.335
CHANGE THE STATE'S OUR

01:56:12.632 --> 01:56:14.534
AS A CIVIL RIGHT BUT WHAT I'M

01:56:14.600 --> 01:56:16.035
HOPING THIS BILL DOES IS PROVIDE

A BIT OF A FRAMEWORK FOR COURTS

01:56:18.004 --> 01:56:19.405
TO BE ABLE.

01:56:19.472 --> 01:56:21.140
TO NAVIGATE THE SITUATION THAT

01:56:21.207 --> 01:56:22.942
THEY HAVE BECAUSE THEY THEY THE

01:56:23.009 --> 01:56:25.111
COURT'S ALSO NEED TO ENSURE THAT

AS ACCURATE.

01:56:28.481 --> 01:56:30.350
AS IT CAN BE AND UNTIL THE POINT

01:56:30.416 --> 01:56:31.984
WHERE WE HAVE SOARED BY COURT

01:56:32.051 --> 01:56:32.985

WHERE THEY'RE NEEDED OR OR OR

01:56:38.991 --> 01:56:40.727
ASK?

01:56:40.793 --> 01:56:42.261
FOR I THINK WE NEED TO PROVIDE A

01:56:42.328 --> 01:56:44.163
LITTLE BIT FLEXIBILITY TO THE

01:56:44.230 --> 01:56:45.898
COURTS HAVE BEEN STANDARDS TO

01:56:45.965 --> 01:56:47.667
FOLLOW ENSURING THAT.

01:56:47.734 --> 01:56:49.369
INTERPRETIVE SERVER SERVICES ARE

01:56:49.435 --> 01:56:52.438
HAPPENING AND I UNDERSTAND THAT

01:56:57.310 --> 01:56:58.177
TODAY.

01:56:58.244 --> 01:56:59.912
BUT THE OPPOSITION RAISES SOME

01:56:59.979 --> 01:57:02.081
SOME SIGNIFICANT ISSUES AND THAT

01:57:02.148 --> 01:57:03.383
IS HOPEFULLY SOMETHING THAT

01:57:03.449 --> 01:57:05.017
THROUGH APPROPRIATE FUNDING AND

01:57:05.084 --> 01:57:05.651

CAN GET.

01:57:06.519 --> 01:57:07.987
TO AT SOME POINT AND I THINK WE

01:57:08.054 --> 01:57:09.355
ALL NEED TO WORK TOGETHER TO

01:57:09.422 --> 01:57:10.590
MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S HAPPENING

01:57:10.656 --> 01:57:12.058
WHEN WE DEAL COURTS FUNDING IT'S

01:57:12.125 --> 01:57:13.659
A LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT.

01:57:13.726 --> 01:57:15.862
AS THIS BODY HAS BEEN ADVOCATING

01:57:19.499 --> 01:57:20.900
THE LEGISLATURE HAS SEEN A REAL

01:57:20.967 --> 01:57:22.301

COURTS WERE LITERALLY THROWING

01:57:26.038 --> 01:57:27.140

THIS PROCESS OF TRYING TO FIND

02:00:35.895 --> 02:00:37.330

02:00:37.396 --> 02:00:38.130
IF THEY DON'T FIND AN

02:00:40.333 --> 02:00:41.901
TO FIND SOMEONE WHO'S JUST AS

GOOD AS AN INTERPRETER.

02:00:44.971 --> 02:00:47.506

I'M OPEN TO AMENDMENTS I'M OPEN

02:02:50.796 --> 02:02:52.064
TO SUGGESTIONS ON HOW TO MAKE

02:02:52.131 --> 02:02:53.833
THIS WORK IN A WAY THAT'S NOT

02:02:53.899 --> 02:02:56.469
GONNA BRING OUR COURTS TO A HALT.

02:02:56.535 --> 02:02:58.070
HE HIMSELF ACKNOWLEDGES THAT

02:02:58.137 --> 02:02:59.338
THERE ARE MANY.

02:02:59.405 --> 02:03:00.706
SMALL CLAIMS PROCEEDINGS SAID

02:03:00.773 --> 02:03:03.242
DON'T HAVE --

02:03:03.309 --> 02:03:05.010
CURRENTLY DON'T HAVE INTERPRETER

02:03:05.077 --> 02:03:07.780
SERVICES AND SOME ARE AT 80% BUT

02:03:07.847 --> 02:03:09.448
THAT'S NOT A 100% OUR GOAL IS TO

02:03:09.515 --> 02:03:11.450
GET A HUNDRED TO A 100%.

02:03:11.517 --> 02:03:12.518
WITHIN THE QUICK CONSTRAINTS

02:03:12.585 --> 02:03:14.019
THAT WE HAPPEN.

02:03:14.086 --> 02:03:15.654
AT AND I'M I'M OPEN TO

02:03:15.721 --> 02:03:17.556
SUGGESTIONS ON HOW TO GET THERE.

02:03:17.623 --> 02:03:18.724
BUT THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE FEW

02:03:18.791 --> 02:03:20.926
AND FAR BETWEEN AND WE NEED TO

02:03:20.993 --> 02:03:23.229
WE NEED A POLICY AND AND THAT WE

02:03:23.295 --> 02:03:24.897
CAN'T HAVE A SITUATION WHERE

02:03:24.964 --> 02:03:28.134
SOME HAVE ZERO AND SOME HAVE.

02:03:28.200 --> 02:03:29.702
EIGHTY WE WE NEED TO GET TO AS

02:03:29.769 --> 02:03:31.203
CLOSE TO A 100% AS WE CAN UNDER

02:03:31.270 --> 02:03:33.205
UNDER THE UNDER THAT THE

02:03:33.272 --> 02:03:34.240
CONSTRAINTS THAT WE HAVE

02:03:34.306 --> 02:03:34.540
[inaudible]

02:03:34.607 --> 02:03:37.810

02:03:37.877 --> 02:03:38.944
APPROPRIATELY WHAT ELSE CAN WE

02:03:39.011 --> 02:03:40.679
DO.

02:03:40.746 --> 02:03:43.015
SO THIS I THINK MOVES THE BALL

02:03:43.082 --> 02:03:45.084
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

02:03:45.151 --> 02:03:47.286

02:03:49.789 --> 02:03:53.225

02:04:00.299 --> 02:04:01.200
LITIGATION WITHIN THE SYSTEM

02:04:01.267 --> 02:04:03.969
THAT COSTS OF COURSE THE COURTS

02:04:04.036 --> 02:04:06.438
MORE MONEY THAT THEY DON'T HAVE.

02:04:06.505 --> 02:04:07.940
SO I I APPRECIATE.

02:04:08.007 --> 02:04:10.442
BUT YOU KNOW THAT YOU'RE ABLE TO

02:04:10.509 --> 02:04:11.944

TO START OPENING UP ONE OF THE

02:34:01.198 --> 02:34:03.367
LAST BASTIONS OF WHITE MALE

02:34:03.434 --> 02:34:05.369

AND TO AND IN THIS COUNTRY --

02:34:11.308 --> 02:34:13.010
THERE ARE OTHER NATIONS WHERE

02:34:13.077 --> 02:34:14.545
THEY ACTUALLY REQUIRE WOMEN ON

02:34:14.612 --> 02:34:16.146
CORPORATE BOARDS.

02:34:16.213 --> 02:34:18.649
THEY DO SO BECAUSE WOMEN ADD

02:34:18.716 --> 02:34:20.517
TREMENDOUS A BENEFIT TO

02:34:20.584 --> 02:34:21.819
COMPANIES IN TERMS OF

02:34:21.885 --> 02:34:24.054
PROFITABILITY PRODUCTIVITY

02:34:24.121 --> 02:34:26.123
INNOVATION.

02:34:26.190 --> 02:34:27.358
A WORKPLACE --

02:34:27.424 --> 02:34:30.327
OF HARMONY IF YOU WERE.

02:34:30.394 --> 02:34:34.231
AND THE RESEARCH IS VERY CLEAR --

02:34:34.298 --> 02:34:36.700
THAT. FOR WHATEVER REASONS AND I

02:34:36.767 --> 02:34:37.668
KNOW THERE'S SOME DISCUSSION

02:34:37.735 --> 02:34:39.303
ABOUT CAUSATION AND WHAT HAVE

02:34:39.370 --> 02:34:41.739
YOU BUT CLEARLY HAVING WOMEN

02:34:41.805 --> 02:34:43.574
HAVING 52% OF THE POPULATION

02:34:43.641 --> 02:34:45.042
REPRESENTED ON CORPORATE BOARDS

02:34:45.109 --> 02:34:47.077
WHEN WOMEN REPRESENT. 70% OF THE

02:34:47.144 --> 02:34:50.414
CONSUMERS I IS A GOOD THING AND

02:34:50.481 --> 02:34:52.016
THE FACT THAT WE HAVE NOT.

02:34:52.082 --> 02:34:53.884
OF BEEN ABLE TO MOVE THAT A

02:34:53.951 --> 02:34:55.185
NEEDLE AT ALL.

02:34:55.252 --> 02:34:56.453
WITH THE RESOLUTION I DID A FEW

02:34:56.520 --> 02:34:59.390
YEARS AGO URGING COMPANIES ARE

02:34:59.456 --> 02:35:00.758
TO ADD WOMEN TO THEIR CORPORATE

02:35:00.824 --> 02:35:02.092
BOARDS AND WE MADE.

02:35:02.159 --> 02:35:04.795
A NO PROGRESS WITH THAT THIS IS

02:35:04.862 --> 02:35:06.830
A MEASURE THAT WILL REQUIRE.

02:35:06.897 --> 02:35:08.098
THAT -- IF A

02:35:08.165 --> 02:35:10.100
BOOK BY TWENTY NINETEEN THE

02:35:10.167 --> 02:35:12.169
BOARD HAS TO HAVE A WOMAN ON IT

02:35:12.236 --> 02:35:13.604
IT BEING STUD THAT YOU DON'T

02:35:13.671 --> 02:35:15.606
NECESSARILY KICK ANYBODY OFF

02:35:15.673 --> 02:35:17.307
THAT YOU WILL ADD A POSITION WE

02:35:17.374 --> 02:35:18.475
BELIEVE THAT THAT.

02:35:18.542 --> 02:35:20.077
SATISFIES FROM THE

02:35:20.144 --> 02:35:21.812
CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTIONS I

02:35:21.879 --> 02:35:23.981
APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION --

02:35:24.048 --> 02:35:26.183
IT'S NOT CLEAR WHERE THIS WOULD

02:35:26.250 --> 02:35:28.085
OR WOULDN'T GO BUT I THINK IT'S

02:35:28.152 --> 02:35:30.554
A WORTHY ENOUGH LEGISLATION THAT

02:35:30.621 --> 02:35:31.088
WE SHOULD.

02:35:31.155 --> 02:35:34.224
A FORCE OF FORCED THE A

02:35:34.291 --> 02:35:36.093
DISCUSSION AND IF IT DOES END UP

02:35:36.160 --> 02:35:39.096
IN THE CALL COURTS MAKE THAT

02:35:39.163 --> 02:35:40.664
DECISION BUT CLEARLY WOMEN HAVE

02:35:40.731 --> 02:35:42.166
BEEN DISCRIMINATED AGAINST IN

02:35:42.232 --> 02:35:43.834
CORPORATE AMERICA FOR FAR TOO

02:35:43.901 --> 02:35:44.935
LONG.

02:35:45.002 --> 02:35:46.737
AYE IT'S TIME WE CHANGE THAT WE

02:35:46.804 --> 02:35:48.205
KNOW THAT WHEN YOU ADD WOMEN TO

02:35:48.272 --> 02:35:50.541
PORTS THAT THE CULTURE CHANGES

02:35:50.607 --> 02:35:52.409
AND IT IS TIME WE CHANGE THE

02:35:52.476 --> 02:35:53.277
CULTURE WHETHER IT'S FOR

02:35:53.343 --> 02:35:55.446
PROFITABILITY WHETHER IT IS TO

02:35:55.512 --> 02:35:56.513
PROTECT WORKERS FROM SEXUAL

02:35:56.580 --> 02:35:58.649
HARASSMENT --

02:35:58.716 --> 02:36:00.517
WHETHER IT IS --

02:36:00.584 --> 02:36:03.320
TO IMPROVE THE INNOVATIVE --

02:36:03.387 --> 02:36:05.789
QUALITIES AVE PARTICULAR COMPANY

02:36:05.856 --> 02:36:08.025
THIS IS A WAY TO GET THEIR AND I

02:36:08.092 --> 02:36:10.294
BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A MEASURE --

02:36:10.360 --> 02:36:12.529
THAT WILL MOVE THE BALL FORWARD

02:36:12.596 --> 02:36:14.631
AND BE BENEFICIAL NOT ONLY IN

02:36:14.698 --> 02:36:16.166
TERMS OF EQUITY BUT IN TERMS OF

02:36:16.233 --> 02:36:18.635
ECONOMICS AND TO THE BENEFIT OF

02:36:18.702 --> 02:36:21.071
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS WELL.

02:36:21.138 --> 02:36:21.672

ENCOURAGE AND COLLABORATE WITH

02:36:46.930 --> 02:36:49.600
COMPANIES TO HELP THEM FIND MORE

02:36:49.666 --> 02:36:51.769
WOMEN? FOR CORPORATE BOARDS THE

02:36:51.835 --> 02:36:53.470
ISSUE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO DEAL

02:36:53.537 --> 02:36:55.773
WITH HERE IS THE PROBLEM OF

02:36:55.839 --> 02:36:57.307
SUPPLY AND DEMAND.

02:36:57.374 --> 02:36:59.643
THERE ARE MANY IN FACT THOUSANDS

02:36:59.710 --> 02:37:01.445
OF QUALIFIED WOMEN NOT ONLY

02:37:01.512 --> 02:37:03.981

FOR THAT CERTIFICATION.

02:37:20.731 --> 02:37:23.367
THE PROBLEM IS THAT THERE ARE

02:37:23.433 --> 02:37:24.034
TOO FEW SEATS.

02:37:24.101 --> 02:37:26.069

AN OPENING EVERY FIVE YEARS

02:37:32.743 --> 02:37:34.211
DOESN'T HAPPEN OFTEN.

02:37:34.278 --> 02:37:34.678

A ALLOWED TO BRING IN WOMEN.

02:38:00.771 --> 02:38:02.372
AND ALSO THE PROBLEM WITH THE

ANNUALLY TO THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:50:02.725 --> 02:50:04.961
INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS OUTLINING

02:50:05.028 --> 02:50:06.896
THE COMPENSATION IN HOURS WORKED

02:50:06.963 --> 02:50:09.699
OF EMPLOYEES BY GENDER RACE

02:50:09.766 --> 02:50:12.168
ETHNICITY AND JOB CATEGORY.

02:50:12.235 --> 02:50:15.672
NOT INDIVIDUALLY BUT BY CATEGORY.

02:50:15.738 --> 02:50:16.873
AND THE GOAL IS TO ENCOURAGE

02:50:16.940 --> 02:50:18.775
EMPLOYERS TO ANALYZE THEIR OWN

02:50:18.841 --> 02:50:20.810

INTENT OF THIS BILL THAT IS THE

02:50:30.086 --> 02:50:31.421
GOAL.

02:50:31.487 --> 02:50:33.456
A IT IS NOT TO SHAME --

02:50:33.523 --> 02:50:36.993
IT IS TO SIMPLY REQUIRE A SHELF

02:50:37.060 --> 02:50:38.895
OF VALUATION TO DETERMINE

02:50:38.962 --> 02:50:40.096
WHETHER OR NOT YOU ARE.

02:50:40.163 --> 02:50:42.732
A DISCRIMINATING AND OFTENTIMES

02:50:42.799 --> 02:50:43.967
I BELIEVE THAT A LOT OF THAT

02:50:44.033 --> 02:50:45.802
DISCRIMINATION IS UNINTENDED YOU

02:50:45.868 --> 02:50:46.869
JUST DON'T KNOW.

02:50:46.936 --> 02:50:47.804
BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T LOOKED MAYBE

02:50:47.870 --> 02:50:50.073
DON'T WANNA LOOK BUT THIS WILL

02:50:50.139 --> 02:50:52.208
REQUIRE THAT YOU DO LOOK AND IT

02:50:52.275 --> 02:50:53.710
WILL ALSO ALLOW --

02:50:53.776 --> 02:50:55.979
DIR INDIA FEE H. TOGETHER

02:50:56.045 --> 02:50:57.647
IMPORTANT DATA THAT ALLOWS HIM

TO SEE IT PATTERNS OF WAGE

02:50:59.582 --> 02:51:01.217

DEVIATIONS OR OUT LIARS TO

02:51:03.653 --> 02:51:05.388
INVESTIGATE FURTHER.

02:51:05.455 --> 02:51:07.123
SO AS I MENTIONED THIS IS NOT A

02:51:07.190 --> 02:51:08.257
BILL ABOUT PUBLIC SHAMING THAT

02:51:08.324 --> 02:51:09.158
WAS A BILL THAT.

02:51:09.225 --> 02:51:10.660
WE HEARD AND ACTUALLY WENT TO

02:51:10.727 --> 02:51:13.763
THE GOVERNOR LAST YEAR A BECAUSE

02:51:13.830 --> 02:51:15.198
AT THAT IS NOT WHAT MY GOAL IS

02:51:15.264 --> 02:51:17.100
MY GOAL IS TO GET PEOPLE TO

02:51:17.166 --> 02:51:19.035
COMPLY IS TO GET COMPANIES TO

02:51:19.102 --> 02:51:20.169
COMPLY.

02:51:20.236 --> 02:51:23.640
AND WE'VE EVEN EXEMPTED A THIS

02:51:23.706 --> 02:51:25.108
DATA FROM BEING ACCESSED THROUGH

02:51:25.174 --> 02:51:27.210
A PUBLIC RECORDS ACT TO CONFIRM

02:51:27.276 --> 02:51:28.611
THAT THIS IS NOT AN ATTEMPT TO

02:51:28.678 --> 02:51:30.046
SAY HEY I GOTCHA.

02:51:30.113 --> 02:51:31.648
THIS IS AN ATTEMPT TO GET

02:51:31.714 --> 02:51:33.483
COMPANIES TO COMPLY.

02:51:33.549 --> 02:51:35.284
SO I HAVE WITH ME TODAY SHANNON

02:51:35.351 --> 02:51:36.419
SMITH CRAWLEY WITH THE AMERICAN

02:51:36.486 --> 02:51:38.721

CALIFORNIAN PLACEMENT LAWYERS.

02:51:45.628 --> 02:51:47.330
THANK YOU FIRST WITNESS PLEASE

02:51:47.397 --> 02:51:48.898
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN BIRDS

02:51:48.965 --> 02:51:49.732
MICHAEL YOSHIHARA WITH THAT

02:51:49.799 --> 02:51:50.733
CALIFORNIA EMPLOYMENT LAWYERS

02:51:50.800 --> 02:51:52.268
ASSOCIATION WE ARE PROUD TO

02:51:52.335 --> 02:51:53.870
COSPONSOR THIS BILL ALONG WITH

02:51:53.936 --> 02:51:55.271
EQUAL RIGHTS ADVOCATES IN A YOU

02:51:55.338 --> 02:51:56.039
W..

02:51:56.105 --> 02:51:57.206
WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH SENATOR

02:51:57.273 --> 02:51:58.841
JACKSON A LOT OF OTHER MEMBERS

02:51:58.908 --> 02:52:00.309
OF THIS LEGISLATURE TO TRY TO

02:52:00.376 --> 02:52:01.711
TACKLE THE GENDER AND RACE WAGE

02:52:01.778 --> 02:52:02.378
GAP.

02:52:02.445 --> 02:52:03.446
ON THAT BUT DESPITE ALL THE

02:52:03.513 --> 02:52:04.547
PROGRESS WE'VE MADE AND

02:52:04.614 --> 02:52:06.649
STRENGTHENING OUR EQUAL PAY LAWS

02:52:06.716 --> 02:52:08.084
THE GENDER AND RACE WAGE GAP OR

02:52:08.151 --> 02:52:10.286
JUST NOT CLOSING FAST ENOUGH.

02:52:10.353 --> 02:52:11.921
AND ONE REASON FOR THAT IS

02:52:11.988 --> 02:52:14.257
BECAUSE WAGE DISPARITIES IS NOT

02:52:14.323 --> 02:52:16.626
JUST NOT JUST ABOUT COMPARING TO

02:52:16.693 --> 02:52:18.227
WORKERS DOING THE SAME JOB AND

02:52:18.294 --> 02:52:19.662
THEY'RE DIFFERENT GENDERS ARE

02:52:19.729 --> 02:52:20.897
DIFFERENT RACES --

02:52:20.963 --> 02:52:21.964
BUT IT'S ALSO ABOUT OCCUPATIONAL

02:52:22.031 --> 02:52:23.599
SEGREGATION WHERE WE'RE SEEING

02:52:23.666 --> 02:52:25.068
HIGHER CONCENTRATIONS OF WOMEN

02:52:25.134 --> 02:52:26.736
AND MINORITIES MINORITIES AND

02:52:26.803 --> 02:52:28.137
LOWER PAID JOBS.

02:52:28.204 --> 02:52:29.238
AND THIS CAN BE THE RESULT OF

02:52:29.305 --> 02:52:32.141
UNFAIR PAY BE THE RESULT OF

02:52:32.208 --> 02:52:34.077
UNCONSCIOUS BIAS DISCRIMINATORY

02:52:34.143 --> 02:52:36.112
HIRING APARTMENT PROMOTION

02:52:36.179 --> 02:52:36.379
PRACTICES.

02:52:36.446 --> 02:52:38.981
ON BUT WE ALSO SEE OF THE

02:52:39.048 --> 02:52:40.183
OFTENTIMES EMPLOYERS ARE JUST

02:52:40.249 --> 02:52:41.384
UNAWARE THAT THESE WAGE

02:52:41.451 --> 02:52:42.885
DISPARITIES EXIST OR THAT THERE

02:52:42.952 --> 02:52:44.487
IS THIS OCCUPATIONAL SEGREGATION

02:52:44.554 --> 02:52:45.354
BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT LOOKING AT

02:52:45.421 --> 02:52:46.923
THE GRANULAR PAY DATA OR THE

02:52:46.989 --> 02:52:47.990
HIGH LEVEL.

02:52:48.057 --> 02:52:49.592
PATTERNS WITHIN WITHIN THEIR

02:52:49.659 --> 02:52:51.694
WHOLE THEIR OWN PAY AND WITHIN

02:52:51.761 --> 02:52:52.962
THEIR OWN PAY DATA.

02:52:53.029 --> 02:52:54.731
AND THIS IS WHY THAT YOU'RE ONE

02:52:54.797 --> 02:52:56.699
OF THE EEOC UNDER THE OBAMA

02:52:56.766 --> 02:52:58.167
ADMINISTRATION PROPOSED THIS

02:52:58.234 --> 02:53:00.002
REVISION TO THE EO ONE REPORTS

02:53:00.069 --> 02:53:01.037
OF THAT THEY GET.

02:53:01.104 --> 02:53:02.805
HOW THESE EMPLOYERS COMPILE ALL

02:53:02.872 --> 02:53:05.108
THIS DATA HOW ABOUT HIGH LEVEL

02:53:05.174 --> 02:53:06.676
LOOK TO SEE IF THERE ARE?

02:53:06.743 --> 02:53:07.810
PAY PATTERNS THAT SHOULD BE

02:53:07.877 --> 02:53:08.811
ADDRESSED --

02:53:08.878 --> 02:53:10.179
AND IT'S WORTH NOTING IN

02:53:10.246 --> 02:53:11.848
EMPHASIZING THAT THE EEOC

02:53:11.914 --> 02:53:13.015
ADOPTED THIS --

02:53:13.082 --> 02:53:15.451
THIS REVISED FORM AFTER OVER TWO

02:53:15.518 --> 02:53:16.986
YEARS OF A RIGOROUS AND

02:53:17.053 --> 02:53:18.588
TRANSPARENT PROCESS INCLUDING A

02:53:18.654 --> 02:53:20.823
PUBLIC HEARING A PILOT STUDY A

02:53:20.890 --> 02:53:23.159
VOTE BY THE EEOC COMMISSIONERS

02:53:23.226 --> 02:53:24.060
TWO ROUNDS OF NOTICE AND PUBLIC

02:53:24.127 --> 02:53:24.527
COMMENT.

02:53:24.594 --> 02:53:25.995
CONSULTATIONS WITH EMPLOYER

02:53:26.062 --> 02:53:28.164
REPRESENTATIVES AGE ARE EXPERTS

02:53:28.231 --> 02:53:30.032
AND NUMEROUS STUDIES --

02:53:30.099 --> 02:53:31.901
SO THROUGH THIS EXTENSIVE REVIEW

02:53:31.968 --> 02:53:33.503
OF THE EEOC DETERMINED.

02:53:33.569 --> 02:53:35.872
A A METHOD OF PAY DATA REPORTING

02:53:35.938 --> 02:53:36.873
THAT WAS SIMPLE.

02:53:36.939 --> 02:53:38.341
AND WOULD NOT UNDULY BURDEN

02:53:38.407 --> 02:53:39.876
EMPLOYERS WHILE STILL PROVIDING

02:53:39.942 --> 02:53:41.310
INFORMATION THAT COULD AGAIN

02:53:41.377 --> 02:53:42.979
UNCOVERED THESE UNFAIR PAY

02:53:43.045 --> 02:53:43.913
PRACTICES.

02:53:43.980 --> 02:53:45.681
I SENATOR JACKSON POINTED OUT

02:53:45.748 --> 02:53:47.083
THIS WILL HELP EMPLOYER SELF

02:53:47.150 --> 02:53:48.417
CORRECTING AND IT WILL ALSO HELP

02:53:48.484 --> 02:53:50.386
OUR STATE AGENCIES WITH TARGETED

02:53:50.453 --> 02:53:51.921
ENFORCEMENT OF OF OUR PAY

02:53:51.988 --> 02:53:53.122
DISCRIMINATION LAWS.

02:53:53.189 --> 02:53:55.792
AND ALSO OUR STATE AGENCIES TO

02:53:55.858 --> 02:53:57.460
LOOK AT DIFFERENT PAY PATTERNS

02:53:57.527 --> 02:53:58.828
WITHIN AND ACROSS DIFFERENT

02:53:58.895 --> 02:54:01.230
INDUSTRIES AND ACROSS AND WITHIN

02:54:01.297 --> 02:54:02.665
DIFFERENT GEOGRAPHICAL

02:54:02.732 --> 02:54:02.965
[inaudible]

02:54:03.032 --> 02:54:06.569
THIS IS A COMMON SENSE APPROACH --

02:54:06.636 --> 02:54:08.271
TO JUST CONTINUE FOLLOWING THIS

02:54:08.337 --> 02:54:09.739
IMPORTANT WORK THAT THE EEOC WAS

02:54:09.806 --> 02:54:11.174
DOING AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL.

02:54:11.240 --> 02:54:15.378
STRONGLY URGE DRIVE THOUGH.

02:54:15.444 --> 02:54:16.312
CHAIRMAN SMITH CROWLEY

02:54:16.379 --> 02:54:17.146
REPRESENTING AMERICAN

02:54:17.213 --> 02:54:19.549
ASSOCIATION OF UNIVERSITY WOMEN

02:54:19.615 --> 02:54:20.983
A CO SPONSOR.

02:54:21.050 --> 02:54:22.652
OF THE AND LIKE TO LYING MYSELF

02:54:22.718 --> 02:54:23.920
WITH OF THE COMMENTS OF THE CALL

02:54:23.986 --> 02:54:25.822
MY COLLEAGUE --

02:54:25.888 --> 02:54:26.689
ONE REASON WHY THIS IS SO

02:54:26.756 --> 02:54:28.491
IMPORTANT TO KEEP COMING BACK

02:54:28.558 --> 02:54:29.425
WITH A DIFFERENT BILLS THAT WE

02:54:29.492 --> 02:54:31.427
COME UP HAD OVER THE LAST FEW

02:54:31.494 --> 02:54:32.261
YEARS.

02:54:32.328 --> 02:54:34.964
IS THAT ACTUALLY THE PAY GAP IS

02:54:35.031 --> 02:54:36.799
WIDENING.

02:54:36.866 --> 02:54:38.968
UP UNTIL THIS YEAR WE THOUGHT IT

02:54:39.035 --> 02:54:40.369
WAS GOING TO TAKE FIFTEEN YEARS

02:54:40.436 --> 02:54:43.072
TO CLOSE.

02:54:43.139 --> 02:54:44.640
THE CURRENT DATA SAYS A HUNDRED

02:54:44.707 --> 02:54:46.976
AND ONE YEARS.

02:54:47.043 --> 02:54:48.978
SO WE NEED TO HAVE A LOT OF

02:54:49.045 --> 02:54:50.713
DIFFERENT TOOLS IN OUR ARSENAL.

02:54:50.780 --> 02:54:54.016
THIS ONE ACTUALLY MIGHT MIND.

02:54:54.083 --> 02:54:55.084
I'M CHANGING YOU KNOW WATCHING

02:54:55.151 --> 02:54:56.052
THAT I USE BEFORE I'M ACTUALLY

02:54:56.118 --> 02:54:57.286
LOOKING AT THIS IS.

02:54:57.353 --> 02:54:59.288
THE SCREENING MAMMOGRAPHY.

02:54:59.355 --> 02:55:00.756
SCREENING MAMMOGRAPHY DOES NOT

02:55:00.823 --> 02:55:01.858
TELL YOU WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAVE

02:55:01.924 --> 02:55:03.359
CANCER.

02:55:03.426 --> 02:55:04.427
IT TELLS YOUR YOU KNOW WHAT WE

02:55:04.493 --> 02:55:05.561
MIGHT WANT TO LOOK AT THAT AREA

02:55:05.628 --> 02:55:06.829
A LITTLE MORE CLOSELY DO SOME

02:55:06.896 --> 02:55:08.397
MORE INVESTIGATION.

02:55:08.464 --> 02:55:09.799
AND DEPENDING ON WHAT YOU FIND

02:55:09.866 --> 02:55:11.534
TO LOOK AT ADDITIONAL LAYERS OF

02:55:11.601 --> 02:55:13.336
OF TESTING.

02:55:13.402 --> 02:55:14.403
SO REALLY IT'S IN AS THE SENATOR

02:55:14.470 --> 02:55:16.005
SAID.

02:55:16.072 --> 02:55:17.607
GIVING PEOPLE GIVING

02:55:17.673 --> 02:55:19.008
ORGANIZATIONS A CHANCE TO EVEN

02:55:19.075 --> 02:55:22.411
RECOGNIZE THEMSELVES.

02:55:22.478 --> 02:55:23.613
OF WHAT THEY'RE ISSUES --

02:55:23.679 --> 02:55:24.747
THAT THEY MAY HAVE A PROBLEM

02:55:24.814 --> 02:55:25.748
THEY MAY HAVE A PROBLEM IT

02:55:25.815 --> 02:55:27.216
DOESN'T SAY THEY DO.

02:55:27.283 --> 02:55:28.417
IT MAY BE SOMETHING LIKE JOB

02:55:28.484 --> 02:55:30.620
SEGREGATION --

02:55:30.686 --> 02:55:32.855
DATA SHOW REPORT SHOW ONLY ABOUT

02:55:32.922 --> 02:55:35.024
612%.

02:55:35.091 --> 02:55:37.760
OF THE PAY DISPARITY IS BASED ON

02:55:37.827 --> 02:55:40.596
BIAS OR DISCRIMINATION.

02:55:40.663 --> 02:55:42.365
SO THE REST OF IT IS THE STATUS

02:55:42.431 --> 02:55:43.599
QUO THEY'RE USED TO DOING THIS

02:55:43.666 --> 02:55:45.468
THEY HAVEN'T CHECKED IN SO THIS

02:55:45.534 --> 02:55:47.169

I UNDERSTAND THAT IT MAY NOT BE

THE AUTHOR'S INTENT BUT LOOKING

02:56:58.374 --> 02:56:59.408

02:56:59.942 --> 02:57:01.143

FOR THIS TO NO LONGER BE SUCH AN

02:57:10.720 --> 02:57:11.487
ISSUE.

02:57:11.554 --> 02:57:12.588
BUT THE PLAIN LANGUAGE OF THE

02:57:12.655 --> 02:57:14.390
BILL SAYS THAT IT WOULD BE

02:57:14.457 --> 02:57:15.992
UNLAWFUL FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO

INFORMATION PRIOR TO LITIGATION

02:57:19.895 --> 02:57:21.397
WHICH MEANS AGAIN WE UNDERSTAND

02:57:21.464 --> 02:57:22.465
THAT IT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE

INFORMATION COULD BE TURNED OVER

02:57:26.068 --> 02:57:27.436
SO WE ASK THAT THAT BE TIGHTENED.

02:57:27.503 --> 02:57:29.305
WE DO UNDERSTAND THAT THEY'VE

02:57:29.372 --> 02:57:31.307

FRIVOLOUS LITIGATION BEING FILE

02:57:36.078 --> 02:57:37.046
BECAUSE WE DO KNOW HOW LITIGIOUS

02:57:37.113 --> 02:57:39.081
CALIFORNIA'S AND ADDITIONALLY

02:57:39.148 --> 02:57:40.850
THIS GOES STILL TO THE

DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF MONEY AND

02:57:48.791 --> 02:57:49.658
HAVE.

02:57:49.725 --> 02:57:51.093
BECAUSE IT'S BASED ON BONA FIDE

02:57:51.160 --> 02:57:52.461
FACTORS AND WE'RE CONCERNED THIS

02:57:52.528 --> 02:57:54.296

02:57:55.698 --> 02:57:57.033
MIGHT NOT BE UNLAWFUL AND AGAIN

02:57:57.099 --> 02:57:58.634
IF THIS INFORMATION BY ANY MEANS

02:57:58.701 --> 02:58:00.403
AS PER AS ALLOWED TO BE PUBLIC.

02:58:00.469 --> 02:58:01.971
THEN YOU'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING

02:58:02.038 --> 02:58:02.838
AT THE HEADLINES WHERE THIS

02:58:02.905 --> 02:58:04.306
COMPANY IT DOES NOT PAY THEIR

03:02:33.142 --> 03:02:34.710

DODD LEADING.

03:02:47.990 --> 03:02:49.158
A THAT THE MARKET TO ITS OWN

DEVICES HAS NOT WORKED AND IT

03:02:51.060 --> 03:02:53.062

03:02:56.732 --> 03:02:57.766
THAT THAT WERE THE CASE.

03:02:57.833 --> 03:02:59.034
AYE WE WOULD HAVE WE WOULD SEE

03:02:59.101 --> 03:03:00.602
FAR GREATER STRIDES THAT WE'VE

03:03:00.669 --> 03:03:02.471
SEEN IN THE LAST TWO THREE

03:03:02.538 --> 03:03:03.772

03:03:03.839 --> 03:03:06.175

CONFIDENT THE SENATE WILL

03:03:13.982 --> 03:03:15.484
CONTINUE TO WORK.

03:03:15.551 --> 03:03:19.021
ON THAT ISSUE AGAIN --

03:03:19.088 --> 03:03:20.456
REMEMBER AS APPLIES TO THAT AS

03:03:20.522 --> 03:03:22.124
WELL AS THE TEMPORARY STAFFING

03:03:22.191 --> 03:03:23.792
ISSUE WHICH I THINK WE CAN COULD

03:03:23.859 --> 03:03:25.260
ALSO BE RESOLVED THE WORRY WOULD

03:03:25.327 --> 03:03:26.662
JUST BE LIKE INTENDED NOT CREATE

03:03:26.729 --> 03:03:28.297
ANOTHER LOOPHOLE AND SO I THINK

03:03:28.364 --> 03:03:29.932
IN BOTH CASES IF THEY'RE GOING

03:03:29.998 --> 03:03:31.100
TO BE FURTHER AMENDMENTS.

03:03:31.166 --> 03:03:31.734
THAT HE TO BE RELATIVELY TIGHT

03:03:31.800 --> 03:03:33.802
NARAL TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF

03:03:33.869 --> 03:03:36.438
CONCERN AND I KNOW THAT --

03:03:36.505 --> 03:03:37.973
SENATOR JACKSON HER STOP AS WAS

03:03:38.040 --> 03:03:39.742
COMMITTEE STOP HERE --

03:03:39.808 --> 03:03:42.478
HAD THE ABILITY TO DO THAT AND I

03:03:42.544 --> 03:03:43.345
WOULD CERTAINLY SUPPORT

03:03:43.412 --> 03:03:46.048
AMENDMENTS THAT TIME HELP TO

03:03:46.115 --> 03:03:48.250
ALLAY SOME OF THE THE CONCERNS.

03:03:48.317 --> 03:03:49.718
I'M.

03:03:49.785 --> 03:03:50.986
ALTHOUGH I AYE AGAIN AS WAS

03:03:51.053 --> 03:03:51.887
DISCUSSED LAST WEEK I THINK OUR

03:03:51.954 --> 03:03:52.988
COLLEAGUE.

03:03:53.055 --> 03:03:55.591

03:03:55.657 --> 03:03:56.358
COLLEAGUE AB SUMMER GONZALEZ

03:03:56.425 --> 03:03:57.726
FLETCHER ON A BILL THAT WAS MUCH

03:03:57.793 --> 03:03:58.527
BROADER.

03:03:58.594 --> 03:03:59.928
LAST YEAR --

03:03:59.995 --> 03:04:02.064
THAT REALLY DID AT THE THE

03:04:02.131 --> 03:04:03.732
INTENTION OF USING HOW THE

03:04:03.799 --> 03:04:04.767
PUBLIC --

03:04:04.833 --> 03:04:07.236
DISCLOSURE AS PART OF THE

03:04:07.302 --> 03:04:09.004
STRATEGY OF OF MOVING THE

03:04:09.071 --> 03:04:11.473
PRIVATE SECTOR A THAT'S NOT WHAT

03:04:11.540 --> 03:04:12.975
THIS BILL DIES --

03:04:13.041 --> 03:04:14.042
AND AYE AYE HOWEVER I THINK THIS

03:04:14.109 --> 03:04:17.279
BILL IS A REALLY IMPORTANT STEP --

03:04:17.346 --> 03:04:19.081
PLAYED IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT

03:04:19.148 --> 03:04:21.350
COMPANIES HAVE A BETTER SENSE

03:04:21.417 --> 03:04:22.518
AND AGAIN SOME AGREED ON THEIR

03:04:22.584 --> 03:04:23.719
OWN RIGHT NOW BUT COMPANIES HAVE

03:04:23.786 --> 03:04:25.387
A BETTER SENSE OF WHERE THEY ARE.

03:04:25.454 --> 03:04:26.722
WHERE THEY NEED TO BE AND THEY

03:04:26.789 --> 03:04:28.323
CAN ACTUALLY HAVE THE THE DATA

03:04:28.390 --> 03:04:30.559
TO GET THEM THERE AND SO WITH

03:04:30.626 --> 03:04:32.227
THAT IT CERTAINLY WAS?

03:04:32.294 --> 03:04:33.762
NOT YOU AS A SECONDARY MOTIONAL

03:04:33.829 --> 03:04:36.432
SUPPORT THE BILL AND CONSTRUCTED

03:04:36.498 --> 03:04:41.470
AMENDMENTS GOING FORWARD AS WELL.

03:04:41.537 --> 03:04:42.971
MORNING SENATOR JACKSON'S HYATT

03:04:43.038 --> 03:04:43.739
SOAMES TO COLOR I THINK BRINGS

03:04:43.806 --> 03:04:44.907
UP A GOOD POINT ABOUT HAVING

03:04:44.973 --> 03:04:46.542
THAT CLARITY WITH ANY AMENDMENTS

03:04:46.608 --> 03:04:48.544
CAN FORCE ON THIS ISSUE OF THAT --

03:04:48.610 --> 03:04:49.912
STOPPING ANOTHER HIGH TURNOVER

03:04:49.978 --> 03:04:51.547
INDUSTRIES I I KNOW THAT THERE'S

03:04:51.613 --> 03:04:53.682
ALREADY I CAN EXCLUSION FROM THE

03:04:53.749 --> 03:04:55.684
DEFINITION OF EMPLOYEE OUR COMES

03:04:55.751 --> 03:04:57.486
THE EO ONE REPORTS THAT.

03:04:57.553 --> 03:04:58.787
I DOESN'T EXIST WITH RESPECT TO

03:04:58.854 --> 03:05:00.289
THE DATA YOU'RE SEEKING HERE AND

03:05:00.355 --> 03:05:01.323
MAYBE THAT WAS --

03:05:01.390 --> 03:05:02.524
NOT INTENTIONAL BECAUSE I THINK

03:05:02.591 --> 03:05:04.059
IT MIGHT ACTUALLY EVEN CAN ASKEW

03:05:04.126 --> 03:05:05.461
THE DATA THAT YOU'RE --

03:05:05.527 --> 03:05:07.329
TRYING TO GET FROM THE SO WOOD

03:05:07.396 --> 03:05:08.130
IS THAT SOMETHING YOU WANTED IT

03:05:08.197 --> 03:05:09.364
IS WE'VE BEEN WORKING AND I

03:05:09.431 --> 03:05:11.300
THINK WE WERE VERY CLOSE ON ON

03:05:11.366 --> 03:05:14.269
THE PASS WAS MENTIONED A NUMBER

03:05:14.336 --> 03:05:14.703
OF THE AMENDMENTS.

03:05:14.770 --> 03:05:16.071
KEEPING IN MIND THE GOAL WHICH

03:05:16.138 --> 03:05:17.673
WAS PROBABLY BETTER ARTICULATED

03:05:17.739 --> 03:05:19.074
BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA THAN

03:05:19.141 --> 03:05:20.476
MYSELF --

03:05:20.542 --> 03:05:23.312
AND AND THE THINGS I DON'T WANT

03:05:23.378 --> 03:05:24.913
TO DO -- I

03:05:24.980 --> 03:05:26.348

I WITH THE ONE MY JOB.

03:16:24.906 --> 03:16:26.040

WERE HEALTHY WE WERE HAPPY.

03:16:29.711 --> 03:16:31.045
AND AS A BUSY MOTHER OF FIVE

03:16:31.112 --> 03:16:32.347
CHILDREN I WAS CONFIDENT

03:16:32.413 --> 03:16:34.149
COMPETENT MY WORK.

03:16:34.215 --> 03:16:36.017
AND I CONTINUE TO GROW AND

03:16:36.084 --> 03:16:38.353
THRIVE IN BOTH MY PROFESSIONAL

03:16:38.419 --> 03:16:39.888
AND MY PERSONAL LIFE.

03:16:39.954 --> 03:16:41.156
AFTER WORKING FOR PREVIOUS

03:16:41.222 --> 03:16:42.190
DEAN'S WITHOUT INCIDENT A NEW

03:16:42.257 --> 03:16:43.958
DEAN TOOK OVER HE BEGAN TOUCHING

03:16:44.025 --> 03:16:45.793
ME IN INAPPROPRIATE WAYS THAT

03:16:45.860 --> 03:16:46.528
MADE ME FEEL EXTREMELY

03:16:46.594 --> 03:16:48.129
UNCOMFORTABLE.

03:16:48.196 --> 03:16:49.731
I DID EVERYTHING TO DENY WHAT

03:16:49.797 --> 03:16:51.432
WAS HAPPENING TO ME I REMEMBER

03:16:51.499 --> 03:16:53.301
MY BODY JUST FREEZING UP.

03:16:53.368 --> 03:16:54.302
I WOULD TRY TO PHYSICALLY

03:16:54.369 --> 03:16:55.370
MENTALLY AND EMOTIONALLY

03:16:55.436 --> 03:16:57.872
SEPARATE MYSELF FROM THE MOMENT.

03:16:57.939 --> 03:16:58.706
I SHARED SOME OF THESE

03:16:58.773 --> 03:16:59.841
EXPERIENCES WITH A COUPLE OF

03:16:59.908 --> 03:17:01.743
SUPERVISORS AND THEY BOTH AGREED

03:17:01.809 --> 03:17:02.944
THAT THE DEANS BEHAVIOR WAS

03:17:03.011 --> 03:17:04.179
HIGHLY INAPPROPRIATE.

03:17:04.245 --> 03:17:05.313
BUT I WAS STILL TOO AFRAID TO

03:17:05.380 --> 03:17:07.148
TELL THEM DIRECTLY.

03:17:07.215 --> 03:17:08.116
OVER TIME I GREW ANXIOUS AND

03:17:08.183 --> 03:17:09.918
THEN DEPRESSED.

03:17:09.984 --> 03:17:11.853
MY BODY WAS EXPERIENCING SO MANY

03:17:11.920 --> 03:17:13.454
DIFFERENT SYMPTOMS I CAN'T EVEN

03:17:13.521 --> 03:17:14.956
NAME THE DEAN WAS INDEED IN A

03:17:15.023 --> 03:17:16.291
POSITION OF POWER AND I WAS HIS

03:17:16.357 --> 03:17:17.225
SUBORDINATE.

03:17:17.292 --> 03:17:18.660
SO I WAS VERY AFRAID TO TELL ON

03:17:18.726 --> 03:17:20.228
THE STOCK BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT

03:17:20.295 --> 03:17:22.096
WOULD COMPROMISE MY EMPLOYMENT.

03:17:22.163 --> 03:17:23.731
MY FAMILY WAS DEPENDING ON ME S

03:17:23.798 --> 03:17:25.033
WAS MY EMPLOYER SO I DID WHAT I

03:17:25.099 --> 03:17:26.634
COULD TO COLD.

03:17:26.701 --> 03:17:27.936
THE WHOLE ORDEAL BECAUSE MANY

03:17:28.002 --> 03:17:29.237
SLEEPLESS NIGHTS AND I WAS

03:17:29.304 --> 03:17:31.472
PHYSICALLY EXHAUSTED.

03:17:31.539 --> 03:17:32.607
I FOUND MYSELF CRYING ALL THE

03:17:32.674 --> 03:17:33.908
TIME EVEN THOUGH I TRIED TO BE

03:17:33.975 --> 03:17:36.744
AS STRONG AS I COULD.

03:17:36.811 --> 03:17:38.179
BUT SOMEHOW I FOUND THE COURAGE

03:17:38.246 --> 03:17:39.781
IF ONLY IN MY DESPERATION AND

03:17:39.847 --> 03:17:40.982
ANGER TO CONFRONT WHAT HE HAD

03:17:41.049 --> 03:17:42.250
BEEN PUTTING ME THROUGH.

03:17:42.317 --> 03:17:43.418
AND WHEN I TOOK THE REST TO

03:17:43.484 --> 03:17:45.086
ADDRESS THE VIOLATIONS I CAN

03:17:45.153 --> 03:17:46.287
ONLY DESCRIBE THE UNIVERSITY'S

03:17:46.354 --> 03:17:48.189
RESPONSE IS OUTRAGEOUS.

03:17:48.256 --> 03:17:49.224
I WAS TOLD THAT I WAS NOT

03:17:49.290 --> 03:17:50.625
FEELING WELL.

03:17:50.692 --> 03:17:52.126
AND THAT I SHOULD USE MY OWN

03:17:52.193 --> 03:17:53.695
HARD EARNED SICK AND VACATION

03:17:53.761 --> 03:17:55.697
TIME TO GET BETTER.

03:17:55.763 --> 03:17:57.198
EVERY ACTION OF MY EMPLOYER THAT

03:17:57.265 --> 03:17:58.299
FOLLOWED SIR TO PROTECT AND

03:17:58.366 --> 03:18:00.068
SUPPORT THE PROFESSIONAL STATUS

03:18:00.134 --> 03:18:01.869
OF MY HARASSER AS WELL AS THE

03:18:01.936 --> 03:18:03.304
REPUTATION OF THE INSTITUTION.

03:18:03.371 --> 03:18:04.973
SO THERE WAS IT WAS ON MEET TO

03:18:05.039 --> 03:18:06.441
MAKE THIS ALL WORK AND CONTINUE

03:18:06.507 --> 03:18:08.476
TO COLD.

03:18:08.543 --> 03:18:09.911
SALLY AS I WAS NOT THE FIRST

03:18:09.978 --> 03:18:10.845
KNOW WHAT I'D BE THE LAST TO GO

03:18:10.912 --> 03:18:11.913
THROUGH THE PAINFUL EXPERIENCE

03:18:11.980 --> 03:18:13.147
OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT AT THE

03:18:13.214 --> 03:18:14.882
UNIVERSITY EVENTUALLY I HAD TO

03:18:14.949 --> 03:18:17.085
TAKE LEGAL ACTION.

03:18:17.151 --> 03:18:18.453
I HAD TO FIGHT THE UNIVERSITY

03:18:18.519 --> 03:18:20.688
CULTURE THAT TOLERATE IT SEXUAL

03:18:20.755 --> 03:18:21.522
HARASSMENT AND ALLOWED IT TO GO

03:18:21.589 --> 03:18:23.524
UNCHECKED.

03:18:23.591 --> 03:18:24.993
MY EXPERIENCE HAS SHOWN ME THAT

03:18:25.059 --> 03:18:27.128
ARE HARASSMENT LAWS HAVE FAILED

03:18:27.195 --> 03:18:27.762
TO ADEQUATELY PROTECT WOMEN LIKE

03:18:27.829 --> 03:18:29.197
ME.

03:18:29.264 --> 03:18:30.331
CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING UP OUR

03:18:30.398 --> 03:18:31.799
CURRENT SEXUAL HARASSMENT LAW

03:18:31.866 --> 03:18:33.067
INCLUDES THE GOAL OF PREVENTING

03:18:33.134 --> 03:18:34.102
OR AT LEAST REDUCING THE

03:18:34.168 --> 03:18:35.536

TO SILENCE.

03:18:41.376 --> 03:18:43.144
AND WHY HAVE OUR LAW ALLOW FOR

03:18:43.211 --> 03:18:44.479
GENEROUS TOLERANCE FOR SEVERE

03:18:44.545 --> 03:18:45.613

SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS VERY

03:18:56.291 --> 03:18:57.525
SERIOUS AND DAMAGING PROBLEM

03:18:57.592 --> 03:18:59.027

03:19:01.963 --> 03:19:03.665

03:19:03.731 --> 03:19:06.200
THIS IS WHY PASSING SENATE BILL

03:19:06.267 --> 03:19:07.502
THIRTEEN HUNDRED IS SO IMPORTANT.

03:19:07.568 --> 03:19:08.636
THIS WILL HELP STRENGTHEN THE

03:19:08.703 --> 03:19:10.104
LAWS SO THAT WORKERS LIKE ME ARE

03:19:10.171 --> 03:19:11.839

IN ORDER TO PREVENT HARASSMENT

03:22:41.282 --> 03:22:42.617

03:22:42.683 --> 03:22:43.885
THIS ENFORCEMENT RATHER THAN

CREATING A NEW PRIVATE RIGHT OF

03:22:45.086 --> 03:22:46.721
ACTION THAT ALLOWS AN EMPLOYEE

03:22:46.787 --> 03:22:48.723
TO SUE FOR HYPOTHETICAL SCENARIO?

03:22:48.789 --> 03:22:50.324
I'M OUR UNDERSTANDING IS IS THAT

03:22:50.391 --> 03:22:54.262
THE APPLY TO EMPLOYEES HOWEVER

03:22:54.328 --> 03:22:55.963
CONCERN STILL IS THAT NOW THE

03:22:56.030 --> 03:22:57.064
COURTS WILL BECOME THE HUMAN

03:22:57.131 --> 03:22:58.132
RESOURCES DEPARTMENT FOR THE

03:22:58.199 --> 03:22:59.300
STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

03:22:59.367 --> 03:23:00.768
ANY SORT OF EMPLOYEE DISPUTE

03:23:00.835 --> 03:23:02.436
REGARDING THE ALLEGATIONS OF

03:23:02.503 --> 03:23:03.738
SURROUNDING SEXUAL HARASSMENT

03:23:03.804 --> 03:23:04.906
CAN NOW BE BROUGHT TO COURT

03:23:04.972 --> 03:23:05.573
WE'RE NOT SAYING THAT THESE ARE

03:23:05.640 --> 03:23:07.041
NECESSARILY SUCCEED IN COURT

03:23:07.108 --> 03:23:08.142
DEPENDING ON ALLEGATIONS

03:23:08.209 --> 03:23:09.010
THEMSELVES.

03:23:09.076 --> 03:23:10.778
BUT THEY WILL BE OLD ENOUGH TO

03:23:10.845 --> 03:23:12.013
SAY TO ME AND PROVIDE A DEMAND

03:23:12.079 --> 03:23:13.414
LETTER TO THE EMPLOYER AND

03:23:13.481 --> 03:23:14.649
REQUIRE THAT A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF

03:23:16.384 --> 03:23:18.286
THE EMPLOYER IN ORDER.

03:23:18.352 --> 03:23:19.353
TO AS SETTLE THIS KIND OF CLAIM

03:23:19.420 --> 03:23:21.155
SO OUR BIGGEST CONCERN AGAIN IS

03:23:21.222 --> 03:23:21.822
THAT THIS IS A SKIRT AROUND THE

03:23:21.889 --> 03:23:23.457
SEVERE PERVASIVE STANDARD WHY

03:23:23.524 --> 03:23:24.358

DISCRIMINATION.

03:23:29.797 --> 03:23:30.798
AND THE COURTS A PARTY DETERMINE

03:23:30.865 --> 03:23:31.599
THE SHOULD NOT BE A PRIVATE

03:23:31.666 --> 03:23:33.034
RIGHT OF ACTION THEY'VE FOUND

03:23:33.100 --> 03:23:34.101
THAT IN ORDER FOR HARASSMENT

PEAK UMPS BROUGHT AS A LAWSUIT.

03:23:38.372 --> 03:23:39.540

03:23:39.607 --> 03:23:40.474
HARASSMENT OR DISCRIMINATION

03:23:40.541 --> 03:23:41.776
ITSELF THAT THERE ACTUALLY HAS

03:23:41.842 --> 03:23:42.643
TO BE HARASSMENT OR

03:23:42.710 --> 03:23:44.278
DISCRIMINATION THAT OCCURRED

03:23:44.345 --> 03:23:46.213
PRIOR TO SUING FOR BAND FAILURE

03:23:46.280 --> 03:23:47.481
TO PREVENT WHAT COULD BE

03:23:47.548 --> 03:23:48.583
POTENTIALLY A HYPOTHETICAL

03:23:48.649 --> 03:23:49.517
SITUATION.

03:23:49.584 --> 03:23:51.085
SALAS OUR BIGGEST CONCERNS AGAIN

03:23:51.152 --> 03:23:52.753
THERE'S ALSO ISSUES WITH THE NON

ASSOCIATION OF FACTORIES THREE

03:24:36.263 --> 03:24:38.032
ISSUES.

03:24:38.099 --> 03:24:40.134
OF THE FIRST IS A SECTION ONE OF

03:24:40.201 --> 03:24:41.802
THE BILL WHICH IS A NUMBER OF

03:24:41.869 --> 03:24:44.171
STATEMENTS OF INTENT I THINK IS.

03:24:44.238 --> 03:24:46.607
URINALYSIS NOTED THAT THESE ARE

03:24:46.674 --> 03:24:48.876

AND DECLARATIONS AND OBVIOUSLY --

03:24:52.079 --> 03:24:53.614
WHILE THEY COULD BE CONSIDERED

03:24:53.681 --> 03:24:55.383
IT'S IT'S CHANGES IN THE LAW

THAT -- YOU

03:24:56.984 --> 03:24:58.619
KNOW GIVE CLEAR DIRECTION TO THE

03:24:58.686 --> 03:25:00.721
COURTS THEMSELVES AND THERE'S

03:25:00.788 --> 03:25:03.357
QUITE A LOT OF INFORMATION IN.

03:25:03.424 --> 03:25:05.393
THE STATEMENTS THAT IS NOT LATER

03:25:05.459 --> 03:25:06.694
AFFIRMED IN ANY STATUTORY

03:25:06.761 --> 03:25:08.929
CHANGES --

03:25:08.996 --> 03:25:10.531
THE SECOND ISSUE JUST TO EXPAND

03:25:10.598 --> 03:25:11.866
UPON THE COMMENTS THAT MISS

03:25:11.932 --> 03:25:13.801
CURTIS MADE --

03:25:13.868 --> 03:25:15.636
CENTER JACKSON HAS INDICATED THE

03:25:15.703 --> 03:25:17.271
AUTHOR HAS INDICATED THAT SHE'S

03:25:17.338 --> 03:25:18.906
TRYING TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE TO

03:25:18.973 --> 03:25:21.142
THE COURTS AND OUR CONCERN IS

03:25:21.208 --> 03:25:22.576
THAT WE FIND THIS IS A

03:25:22.643 --> 03:25:23.978
SUBSTANTIALLY LOWERING.

03:25:24.045 --> 03:25:25.846
OF THE STANDARDS AND THERE ARE A

03:25:25.913 --> 03:25:27.515
NUMBER OF QUESTIONS I THINK THAT

03:25:27.581 --> 03:25:29.183
THE AUTHORS AMENDMENT THAT WAS

03:25:29.250 --> 03:25:31.218
TAKEN CERTAINLY GOES A LONG WAY

03:25:31.285 --> 03:25:32.920
BUT THERE ARE OTHER AMBIGUITIES

03:25:32.987 --> 03:25:34.622
FOR EXAMPLE.

03:25:34.689 --> 03:25:37.391
IN SUBDIVISION QUE WHAT PART TO

03:25:37.458 --> 03:25:39.193
A AT WHAT POINT DOES THE

03:25:39.260 --> 03:25:42.163
EMPLOYER BEFORE AFTER THE

03:25:42.229 --> 03:25:44.498
CONDUCT A HAS OCCURRED.

03:25:44.565 --> 03:25:46.200
SO WHEN DID THEY KNOW IT WAS ON

03:25:46.267 --> 03:25:47.635
WELCOME TO THE EMPLOYEES.

03:25:47.702 --> 03:25:50.337
AND QUE TO BE.

03:25:50.404 --> 03:25:52.540
IF IT INCREASED I THINK THE

03:25:52.606 --> 03:25:54.675
CONCERN HERE IS THAT IT MAY NOT

03:25:54.742 --> 03:25:56.944
MEET THE CURRENT LEGAL STANDARD

03:25:57.011 --> 03:26:00.781
WHICH IS PERVASIVE --

03:26:00.848 --> 03:26:02.650
OR SEVERE SEVERE OR PERVASIVE

03:26:02.717 --> 03:26:04.552
RATHER THAN AND WHICH I THINK

03:26:04.618 --> 03:26:05.186
HAS BEEN --

03:26:05.252 --> 03:26:08.556
MENTIONED A FEW TIMES IT'S AN OR

03:26:08.622 --> 03:26:10.324
BUT WHAT WILL IN THE FUTURE MEAN

03:26:10.391 --> 03:26:12.226
IN ESSENCE FOR EXAMPLE I THINK

03:26:12.293 --> 03:26:13.828
THE ANALOGY THAT SOMEONE IS USED

03:26:13.894 --> 03:26:15.329
IN THE PAST IS.

03:26:15.396 --> 03:26:18.766
BUT AS I'M COMING UP TO A STOP

03:26:18.833 --> 03:26:20.701
SIGN OR A RED LIGHT I COULD

03:26:20.768 --> 03:26:23.204
CROSS THROUGH IN BE CITED BUT IF

03:26:23.270 --> 03:26:24.638
I STOP I HAVE NOT.

03:26:24.705 --> 03:26:26.540
SO HOW DO WE DETERMINE THIS IF

03:26:26.607 --> 03:26:29.143
IT INCREASED IN --

03:26:29.210 --> 03:26:31.545
IN A AND B. THE STATUE OR THE

03:26:31.612 --> 03:26:33.047
BILL USES THE THE TERM OF THE

03:26:33.114 --> 03:26:35.583
CONDUCT AND THEN LATER IN SEE

03:26:35.649 --> 03:26:37.551
SAME OR SIMILAR --

03:26:37.618 --> 03:26:39.420
HOW IS THAT HOW IS THAT TO BE

03:26:39.487 --> 03:26:41.756
DETERMINED BY THE EMPLOYER?

03:26:41.822 --> 03:26:43.991
AND THE THE LAST ITEM THAT ALL

03:26:44.058 --> 03:26:45.893
REYES IS IN SUBDIVISION

03:26:45.960 --> 03:26:48.229
[inaudible] FIVE FIVE WHICH IS

03:26:48.295 --> 03:26:50.131
WHAT WE VIEW TO BE CURRENT LAW

03:26:50.197 --> 03:26:52.099
SAYS THAT EITHER PREVAILING

03:26:52.166 --> 03:26:52.967
PARTY.

AND WE THINK THE VERY HIGH

03:26:57.772 --> 03:26:59.874
THRESHOLD THAT WOULD ONLY BE

03:26:59.940 --> 03:27:02.843
IMPOSED UPON THE DEFENDANT --

03:27:02.910 --> 03:27:04.278
WILL SEVERELY LIMIT THEIR

03:27:04.345 --> 03:27:06.247
ABILITY TO RECOVER REASONABLE

03:27:06.313 --> 03:27:07.214

03:28:13.447 --> 03:28:16.016
ACTIONABLE NO.

03:28:16.083 --> 03:28:17.151
COULD YOU EXPLAIN THAT BECAUSE

03:28:17.218 --> 03:28:18.285
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE

03:28:18.352 --> 03:28:18.819
OPPOSITION HAS A DIFFERENT

03:28:18.886 --> 03:28:19.587
AGENDA.

03:28:19.653 --> 03:28:21.388
THE CURRENT DUTY IS THERE AND

03:28:21.455 --> 03:28:22.823
THERE'S HARDLY AN AFFIRMATIVE

03:28:22.890 --> 03:28:24.692
DUTY TO PREVENT HARASSMENT.

03:28:24.758 --> 03:28:26.460
BUT IT DOESN'T RISE TO THE LEVEL

03:28:26.527 --> 03:28:29.563
OF SEVERE OR PERVASIVE.

03:28:29.630 --> 03:28:33.267
UNTIL A LORD DOESN'T RISE TO THE

03:28:33.334 --> 03:28:36.136
LEVEL OF BEING ACTIONABLE UNDER

03:28:36.203 --> 03:28:37.071
LAW.

03:28:37.137 --> 03:28:40.374
UNLESS IT IS SEVERE OR PERVASIVE.

03:28:40.441 --> 03:28:42.376
AND THAT IS THE STANDARD THAT WE

03:28:42.443 --> 03:28:44.245
ARE USING SEVERE OR PERVASIVE

03:28:44.311 --> 03:28:45.846
THAT IS WHEN THE BEHAVIOR

03:28:45.913 --> 03:28:48.115
BECOMES ACTIONABLE.

03:28:48.182 --> 03:28:51.986
WHAT WE ARE SAYING ON IN OUR --

03:28:52.052 --> 03:28:54.054
LANGUAGE HERE IS THAT AN

03:28:54.121 --> 03:28:55.723
EMPLOYER HAS A DUTY.

03:28:55.789 --> 03:28:57.658
BEFORE IT BECOMES SEVERE OR

03:28:57.725 --> 03:28:59.260
PERVASIVE.

03:28:59.326 --> 03:29:02.763
I TAKE ALL REASONABLE STEPS TRY

03:29:02.830 --> 03:29:05.232
TO PREVENT THE BEHAVIOR ONCE THE

03:29:05.299 --> 03:29:07.134
EMPLOYER KNOWS OF THE BEHAVIOR.

03:29:07.201 --> 03:29:08.702
THAT THEY KNOW IT'S ON WELCOME

03:29:08.769 --> 03:29:10.137
SO ALL THIS STUFF ABOUT --

03:29:10.204 --> 03:29:12.006
HOW DID THEY KNOW IT'S WHEN

03:29:12.072 --> 03:29:13.407
SOMEBODY COMES TO THEM AND SAYS?

03:29:13.474 --> 03:29:15.576
SO AND SO DID SUCH AND SUCH AND

03:29:15.643 --> 03:29:17.111
IT MAKES ME FEEL BAD I'M ITS

03:29:17.177 --> 03:29:19.346
UNWELCOME AT THAT POINT IN TIME

03:29:19.413 --> 03:29:21.048
IT COULD BE ONE INCIDENT.

03:29:21.115 --> 03:29:23.517
THE EMPLOYER THEN WILL HAVE AN

03:29:23.584 --> 03:29:25.853
AFFIRMATIVE DUTY WHICH THEY HAVE

03:29:25.920 --> 03:29:27.788
TO TAKE ALL REASONABLE STEPS IF

03:29:27.855 --> 03:29:30.090
THEY TAKE STEPS AND THE BEHAVIOR

03:29:30.157 --> 03:29:31.859
STOPS YOU'RE DONE.

03:29:31.926 --> 03:29:33.560
THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT THE IRONY

03:29:33.627 --> 03:29:35.996
IS WE'RE TRYING TO ARE ENCOURAGE

03:29:36.063 --> 03:29:38.565
EMPLOYERS TO TAKE STEPS AS

03:29:38.632 --> 03:29:40.501
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO AT THE

03:29:40.567 --> 03:29:42.503
EARLIEST POSSIBLE STAGE SO THAT

03:29:42.569 --> 03:29:44.405
IT DOESN'T RISE TO THE SEVERE OR

03:29:44.471 --> 03:29:45.973
PERVASIVE STANDARD WHICH THEN

03:29:46.040 --> 03:29:48.442
BECOMES A LAWSUIT.

03:29:48.509 --> 03:29:49.643
I SEE SERVE THERE IS THAT A

03:29:49.710 --> 03:29:50.344
SINGLE INCIDENT AND IT'S ON

03:29:50.411 --> 03:29:51.378
WHILE TIME AND THE EMPLOYER

03:29:51.445 --> 03:29:54.415
BECOMES AWARE OF IT --

03:29:54.481 --> 03:29:56.283
AND THEY FAILED TO TAKE --

03:29:56.350 --> 03:29:58.052
REASONABLE STEPS DOES AT THAT

03:29:58.118 --> 03:29:59.086
POINT BECOME ACTIONABLE IT IS

03:29:59.153 --> 03:30:00.020

ANOTHER INCIDENT FOLLOWING THEIR

03:30:01.622 --> 03:30:03.223
FAILURE TO TAKE REASONABLE STEPS

03:30:03.290 --> 03:30:05.059
THEY HAVE TO TAKE THEY IF IT

03:30:05.125 --> 03:30:07.294

TO THE SUPERVISOR AND SAID THIS

03:31:34.248 --> 03:31:35.282
IS GOING ON THIS MAKES ME

03:31:35.349 --> 03:31:36.116
UNCOMFORTABLE.

03:31:36.183 --> 03:31:38.052
THE EMPLOYER'S DUTY AT THAT

03:31:38.118 --> 03:31:40.254
POINT TIME IS TO TAKE REASONABLE

03:31:40.320 --> 03:31:42.990
STEPS TO STOP THE BEHAVIOR.

TERMINATE THE EMPLOYEE AND THE

03:32:08.849 --> 03:32:09.917
EMPLOYEE COULD POTENTIALLY BRING

03:32:09.983 --> 03:32:11.285
A CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST THE

03:32:11.351 --> 03:32:12.519
EMPLOYER NOW FOR FAILURE TO

03:32:12.586 --> 03:32:13.020
PREVENT HARASSMENT OR

03:32:13.087 --> 03:32:14.188
DISCRIMINATION THIS IS A NEW

03:32:14.254 --> 03:32:15.522
PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION.

03:32:15.589 --> 03:32:16.590
RIGHT NOW IT'S BROADENED

03:32:16.657 --> 03:32:17.724
CONJUNCTION WITH HARASSMENT

03:32:17.791 --> 03:32:19.493
DISCRIMINATION AND NO LONGER

03:32:19.560 --> 03:32:20.327
NEEDS TO HAVE HARASSMENT

03:32:20.394 --> 03:32:21.361
DISCRIMINATION IN CONJUNCTION

03:32:21.428 --> 03:32:23.263
WITH THIS TO BRING A PRIVATE

03:32:23.330 --> 03:32:23.864
RIGHT OF ACTION FOR FAILURE TO

03:32:23.931 --> 03:32:24.531

03:32:24.598 --> 03:32:29.470

MORE THAN HAPPY TO GIVE SENATOR

03:32:34.708 --> 03:32:36.110
CANCERS.

03:32:36.176 --> 03:32:36.844
I JUST A VERY QUICKLY THERE

03:32:36.910 --> 03:32:38.278
ALREADY EXISTS A PRIVATE RIGHT

03:32:38.345 --> 03:32:39.780
OF ACTION UNDER THAT.

03:32:39.847 --> 03:32:41.849
THE CURRENT STATUTES SO TO SAY

03:32:41.915 --> 03:32:43.383
THAT THIS CREATES A PRIVATE

03:32:43.450 --> 03:32:44.551
RIGHT OF ACTION THAT DOESN'T

03:32:44.618 --> 03:32:45.385
CURRENTLY EXIST IT'S NOT

03:32:45.452 --> 03:32:47.754
ACCURATE --

03:32:47.821 --> 03:32:49.556
I ALSO WHICH IS LIKE IF I CAN

03:32:49.623 --> 03:32:51.992
FOR JUST ONE MOMENT POINT OUT I

03:32:52.059 --> 03:32:53.360
UNDERSTAND THEM AND THAT.

03:32:53.427 --> 03:32:53.927
THEY HAVE TO STOP YOU THERE

03:32:53.994 --> 03:32:57.231
BECAUSE THANK YOU FOR MEMBERS

03:32:57.297 --> 03:32:58.465
ASK QUESTIONS WILL ADMIT TO THAT

03:32:58.532 --> 03:33:00.000
OTHER.

03:33:00.067 --> 03:33:03.070
QUESTIONS FROM THE DICE.

03:33:03.137 --> 03:33:04.104
ALRIGHT SAID I WANNA THANK YOU

03:33:04.171 --> 03:33:05.239
FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND

03:33:05.305 --> 03:33:06.940
AND IN FOR CLARITY WHAT'S WHAT'S

03:33:07.007 --> 03:33:08.976
DIFFICULT ABOUT THIS I THINK IS

03:33:09.042 --> 03:33:10.844
WE KNOW WHAT THAT THE STANDARD

03:33:10.911 --> 03:33:12.513
IS THE SEVERE AND PERVASIVE.

03:33:12.579 --> 03:33:13.814
BUT WE ALSO HAVE TOO MANY

03:33:13.881 --> 03:33:16.316
INSTANCES WHERE THERE IS SOME

03:33:16.383 --> 03:33:17.985
ACTIVITY BY AN EMPLOYEE.

03:33:18.051 --> 03:33:19.720
THAT THE EMPLOYER IS WARNED

03:33:19.786 --> 03:33:22.723
ABOUT AND THEN BECAUSE THEY FEEL

03:33:22.789 --> 03:33:23.857
THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO TAKE

03:33:23.924 --> 03:33:24.358
ACTION DOESN'T.

03:33:24.424 --> 03:33:26.793
THEY DON'T TAKE ACTION.

03:33:26.860 --> 03:33:28.562
THEN THERE MAY BE SUBSEQUENT.

03:33:28.629 --> 03:33:30.097
ACTIONS THAT ARE OFFENSIVE THAT

03:33:30.164 --> 03:33:31.398
START TO HAPPEN.

03:33:31.465 --> 03:33:33.467
AND THE NOTION WITH THIS BILL IS

03:33:33.534 --> 03:33:35.669
THOUGH SUBSEQUENT.

03:33:35.736 --> 03:33:37.738
ACTIONS WOULD BE PREVENTABLE IF

03:33:37.804 --> 03:33:39.873
THE EMPLOYER FELT OBLIGATED TO

03:33:39.940 --> 03:33:41.542
STEP IN AND A LOT OF THE

03:33:41.608 --> 03:33:43.310
EXAMPLES ARE ONCE THAT I THINK

03:33:43.377 --> 03:33:44.711
WE WOULD ALL SAY WAIT A MINUTE

03:33:44.778 --> 03:33:46.580
NOBODY TOLD THAT EMPLOYER THAT

03:33:46.647 --> 03:33:48.215
EMPLOYEE NOT TO DO THAT ANYMORE.

03:33:48.282 --> 03:33:49.550
THAT BY ITSELF IS KIND OF

03:33:49.616 --> 03:33:51.451
OUTRAGEOUS.

03:33:51.518 --> 03:33:52.119
BECAUSE I'M THE THE EXAMPLES ARE

03:33:52.186 --> 03:33:53.687
OUTRAGEOUS.

03:33:53.754 --> 03:33:55.856
AND SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES I

03:33:55.923 --> 03:33:56.690
THINK WHERE IT'S VERY

03:33:56.757 --> 03:33:56.990
APPROPRIATE.

03:33:57.057 --> 03:33:58.659
IS.

03:33:58.725 --> 03:34:00.027
WHERE THEY'VE EMPLOYER NOW WAS

03:34:00.093 --> 03:34:02.095
ON NOTICE AND HAS BEEN INFORMED

03:34:02.162 --> 03:34:03.363
THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO STOP?

03:34:03.430 --> 03:34:05.866
FURTHER ABUSES IF THEY WOULD

03:34:05.933 --> 03:34:08.168
JUST STEP ED THEY DON'T HAVE AN

03:34:08.235 --> 03:34:09.603
INCENTIVE TO STEP IN THIS BILL

03:34:09.670 --> 03:34:10.737
GIVES MATT INCENTIVE TO STEP AND

03:34:10.804 --> 03:34:11.538
THAT'S WHY I THINK IT'S

03:34:11.605 --> 03:34:15.042
ABSOLUTELY APPROPRIATE.

03:34:15.108 --> 03:34:16.877
NO OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS

03:34:16.944 --> 03:34:19.413
SENATOR YOU MAY CLOSE HIS --

03:34:19.479 --> 03:34:20.013

03:34:28.088 --> 03:34:29.556
BEHAVIOR.

03:34:29.623 --> 03:34:31.024

EMPLOYER KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE

03:34:59.086 --> 03:35:00.487
KNOWN.

03:35:00.554 --> 03:35:04.524
THIS IS WHEN THE EMPLOYER KNOWS --

03:35:04.591 --> 03:35:05.926
THEY DON'T THINK YES IT'S WHEN

03:35:05.993 --> 03:35:08.595
