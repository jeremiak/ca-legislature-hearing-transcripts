I ALSO IT ALSO URGES HIM TO WORK WITH CONGRESS TO FIND A PATH TO LEGAL STATUS FOR THE HARD WORKING. AND DETERMINE SALVADORAN POPULATION. LESS THAN TEN DAYS AGO I CO LEAD A LEGISLATION BY LEGISLATIVE DELEGATION MISSION TOLL SALVADOR. WITH THE SPEAKER. AND MY COLLEAGUES FROM FRESNO IN CARSON. WE MET WITH THE VARIETY OF LOCAL SALVADORANS DIGNITARIES AND SALVADORIAN PRESIDENT SOME OTHER SCIENTISTS THAT AND. WE WITNESSED A COUNTRY FACING POLITICAL ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES BUT ALSO. A PROUD PEOPLE FULL OF HOPE FOR THE FUTURE. DUE TO NATURAL DISASTERS AND CIRCUMSTANCES BEYOND ANYONE'S PERSONAL CONTROL. NEARLY TWO HUNDRED THOUSANDTHS RECIPIENTS FOUND REFUGE ON OUR SHORES. AND IN OUR HOME AND THEN ARE HOMELESS BECAUSE THEIR COMMUNITIES. THE GOOD CHARACTER AND VALUES GUIDING ALSO DORIAN'S HAVE ADDED TO THE CHARACTER OF THE UNITED STATES AND CALIFORNIA. THEY HAVE MADE A LIVING. IN MULTIPLE FEEL IMMORTAL FIELDS HAVE CREATED SMALL BUSINESSES BUT HOMES PAY BILLS PAID TAXES. THEY RAISE FEW ES BORN CHILDREN THAT ATTEND OUR SCHOOLS IN OUR IN IN TRICKLE PART OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND OUR ECONOMY. THEY ARE A PART OF THE AMERICAN DREAM AND HAVE. AND HAVE EARNED THAT DREAM FOR NEARLY TWO DECADES. THE PRESIDENT'S REVERSAL WILL TEAR THAT CAME APART WITHIN THE NEXT EIGHTEEN MONTHS. THE ADMINISTRATION'S DECISION TO TERMINATE THEIR PROTECT US THAT IT WAS NOT BASED ON ANY CONDITIONS AND ALL SOLID OR. THERE WAS NO NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN A THOUGHT OR CIRCUMSTANCES AND NO REASON TO RISK THEN TPS. DECISIONS THAT AFFECT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES. MUST BE THOUGHTFUL. AND JUSTIFIED NOT BASED ON PREJUDICE OR SWEEPING GENERALIZATIONS. THE PRESIDENT'S RECENT TWEETS UNFAIRLY STEREOTYPED SALVADORIAN SAYS MS THIRTEEN GANG MEMBERS AND DISPLAYED AN UNDIGNIFIED THOUGHTLESS AND HEARTLESS SUPPORT APPROACH. TO DIPLOMACY THAT IS UNBECOMING OF THE PRESIDENT OF OUR GREAT NATION. I WOULD ENCOURAGE THE PRESIDENT TO TAKE HIS OWN TRIP TO ALL SALVADORAN ACTUALLY GET TO KNOW THE COUNTRY. AND THE PEOPLE HE IS DISPARAGING. AS THE ONLY CALIFORNIA STATE LEGISLATOR OF SALVADORAN HERITAGE IT IS MY DUTY TO SHINE LIGHT. ON THE PRESIDENT'S MISGUIDED STATEMENTS THAN DECISIONS REGARDING EL SALVADOR. SALVADORANS ARE NOT A DRAIN ARE A DANGER TO OUR FOR OUR SOCIETY. THE NUMBERS PROVE JUST THE OPPOSITE WERE A KEY PART OF THE WORK FORCE AND THE ECONOMY IN FACT. WHAT HARD WORK AND PASSION WE CAN EVEN JOIN? THE RANKS OF THESE PROCEDURES LEGISLATIVE BODY. THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION ON TPS. REVERSE REVERSES DECADES. A BIPARTISAN FOREIGN POLICY PRESIDENT. IT. IF IT REMAINS UNCHANGED THOUSANDS OF SALVADORANS WILL BE TORN FROM THEIR HOMES. AND FORCED INTO HIDING. AND THAT WILL BE A DEVASTATING BLOW TO THE PRINCIPLES OF LIBERTY FREEDOM. OF WHICH THIS COUNTRY STANDS FOR. I STRONGLY URGE AN AYE VOTE FOR HR SIX NINE TO BOLSTER OUR BELIEF IN MEANINGFUL. DOT FULL DIPLOMATIC RELATIONSHIPS AS WELL AS CALIFORNIA SUPPORT FOR SALVADORAN BROTHERS AND SISTERS. IN THEIR FIGHT FOR PERMANENT RESIDENCY THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS CARILLO MISTER LACKEY YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS. I STAND HERE IS A PROUD CO AUTHOR. A MAJOR SIXTY NINE. MY DISTRICT HAS A LARGE POPULATION. OF EL SALVADORIAN IMMIGRANTS. MANY THESE INDIVIDUALS HAVE BENEFITED GREATLY FROM THE TPS PROGRAM. I AM PROUD THAT WE'RE JOINED TODAY IN THE GALLERY BY A NUMBER OF CONSTITUENTS FROM MY DISTRICT. WHO ARE AFFECTED DIRECTLY BY THIS ISSUE? THE TPS PROGRAM WAS CREATED BY CONGRESS TO PROTECT IMMIGRANTS WHO COULD NOT SAFELY RETURNED TO THEIR COUNTRIES. DUE TO ARMED CONFLICTS. ENVIRONMENTAL DISASTERS OR OTHER EXTRAORDINARY AND SOME TEMPORARY CONDITIONS. THE DECISION TO END THE TPS PROGRAM LEAVES THESE INDIVIDUALS AND DOUBT FOR THEIR FUTURE. IF TPS IS NOT RENEWED MANY OF THEM WOULD BE FORCED TO RETURN TO EL SALVADOR. A COUNTRY THEY HAVE NOT LIVED IN FOUR DECADES. I WON THAT ARE STILL INCREASINGLY PLAGUED WITH SEVERE VIOLENCE. THIS ROUTE RESOLUTION CALLS ON CONGRESS TO CREATE A LEGISLATIVE SOLUTION. TO ESTABLISH A LONG TERM SOLUTION FOR TBS RICK RECIPIENTS. THIS IS A STRONG BIPARTISAN MEASURE WHAT I BELIEVE IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. AND I ASKED YOU SUPPORT HR SIXTY NINE. THANK GOODNESS LACKEY MISS RETIREMENT YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES A RISE IN SUPPORT OF HR SIXTY NINE. LIKE TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES FOR HER AUTHORSHIP IN LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE. ARE CLEARLY THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN OUTSPOKEN IN HIS VIEWS ON IMMIGRATION AND THIS COMES AS NO SURPRISE. WE'VE SEEN THAT THERE'S BEEN SIMILAR ATTEMPTS TO TURN BACK REFER JEEZ FROM HAITI IN NICARAGUA. WE MUST RECOGNIZE THAT MOST EL SALVADORAN REFUGEES WERE ESCAPING THE CONDITIONS. OF THE COUNTRY AFTER THE END OF A CIVIL WAR. CONDITIONS THAT WERE CREATED IN LARGE PART BY INVOLVEMENT FROM. U. S. INFLUENCES. AS A NATION. WE HAVE A MORAL DUTY TO FIND A SOLUTION FOR THOSE WHO WERE IMPACTED BY ITS ACTIONS WE MUST. CONSIDER THE PARENTS. OF MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED AND NINETY THOUSAND U. S. BORN CHILDREN WHOSE FAMILIES WOULD BE RIPPED APART. WE MUST FOLLOW THE WORDS. OF OUR STATUE OF LIBERTY TO GIVE ME YOUR TIRED YOUR POOR. YOUR HUDDLED MASSES YEARNING TO BREATHE FREE. OUR STATUE OF LIBERTY SAYS NOTHING ABOUT A TIME LIMIT ON SAID REFUGEES. TO REVOKE THEIR STATUS. WOULD BE INCONSISTENT. WITH THE TRADITIONS THAT WE HOLD VALUABLE HERE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. ON PRACTICAL GROUNDS. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT REFUGEES WHO CAN WHO CONTRIBUTE TO OUR ECONOMY FOR ALMOST TWENTY YEARS THEY'VE BEEN PAYING TAXES. RAISING FAMILIES. STARTING BUSINESSES. AND CONTRIBUTE COLLECTIVELY SOME THREE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS TO OUR ECONOMY. THEY ALSO HELPED IMPROVE THEIR NATIVE COUNTRIES TO DIE THEIR CONTINUED CONSTITUTIONS. OF THIS COUNTRY AND ALSO BELT AL SALVADOR IS CRUEL AND UNNECESSARY. NOW IS THE TIME FOR CONGRESS TO ACT. NOT JUST FOR SALVADORANS BUT FOR ALL OF THE TBS HOLDERS WHO ARE PART OF THIS GREAT STATE AND NATION. I RESPECTFULLY URGE AYE VOTE. DOCTOR ARAMBULA YOUR RECOGNIZE.

BUT I WANTED TO TAKE A MOMENT IF I COULD TO TELL YOU HOW OUR COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES IS A BEACON OF HOPE. FOR AN ENTIRE COUNTRY. FOR WHILE WE WERE THERE AND MET WITH THEIR PRESIDENT THEIR VICE PRESIDENT AND THEIR CONGRESS. THEY LOOKED UP TO THE FACT THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY WE HAVE ELECTED. SOMEONE WHO WAS BORN IN EL SALVADOR. AND THEY LOOKED TO YOU AS A BEACON OF HOPE. THE DELEGATION WAS A POWERFUL EXPERIENCE FOR US IN LEARNING AND UNDERSTANDING THE ISSUES THAT PLAGUE EL SALVADOR. AND CALIFORNIA'S TIES AND RELATIONSHIPS WITH THIS NATION. AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ASSEMBLY DISTRICT IN THE THIRTY FIRST. THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF SALVADORIAN IS WHO LIVE IN MY COMMUNITY RIGHT NOW. MANY OF THEM WHO ARE IN VULNERABLE POSITIONS WITH THE RECENT ANNOUNCEMENT TO TERMINATE TEMPORARY PROTECTED STATUS. I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF HR SIXTY NINE. IT IS A SHAME. THAT THE T. P. S. DESIGNATION IS BEING TERMINATED. IT IS A CLEAR SIGN TO OUR SALVADORAN SISTERS AND BROTHERS THAT THEY ARE NO LONGER SAFE IN THIS COUNTRY. IT IS AN INTENTIONAL DECISION TO IN DANGER. AND DESTABILIZE THEIR LIVES AND RIP APART THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES. WITH DEPORTING HARDWORKING INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE CONTRIBUTING TO OUR SOCIETY RIGHT NOW. WE AS CALIFORNIANS NEED TO LEAD THE WAY. IN SUPPORTING THESE MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY AND CALL ON THE PRESIDENT AND CONGRESS TO DO THE SAME. I ENCOURAGE MY FELLOW ASSEMBLYMEMBERS FOR YOUR AYE VOTES TODAY ON EACH ARE SIXTY NINE.

HAS HELPED THOUSANDS ABOUT SALVADORIAN SPINE ON SAFETY AND SECURITY. BUT NOW NUMBER FORTY FIVE IS FORCING OUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS TO RETURN. TO A COUNTRY THAT IS NOT PREPARED TO RECEIVE THEM. THIS IS ACCORDING TO AL SALVADORIAN OWN PRESIDENT. AND I'VE ASKED THIS ADMINISTRATION TO RENEW THE DESIGNATION. THIS DECISION WOULD FORCE PEOPLE LIKED VERONICA. LIKE VERONICA. LIKE VERONICA. NOW SEVEN DORIAN WHO WORK OVERTIME AND DAY AND NIGHT TO SUPPORT HER FAMILY OR CHILDREN. TO LEAVE HER FAMILY CHILDREN BEHIND. TPS HAS BEEN RENEWED. BY PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS BECAUSE OF THE CONDITIONS AND OUT SALVADOR REMAIN DIRE. BUT WE MUST ALSO RECOGNIZE THE OUTSIDER DORIAN'S. WITH THE TPS. HOW CONTRIBUTE SO MUCH TO OUR COUNTRY?

CALIFORNIA DOESN'T GET TO HAVE ITS OWN IMMIGRATION POLICY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S GONNA FIGURE IT OUT. IF YOU WANT TO DECIDE IMMIGRATION. TIME TO RUN FOR CONGRESS THE FILING PERIOD RIGHT NOW TO BE ABLE TO SIDE WHAT TO RUN FOR. BUT CALIFORNIA DOES NOT GET TO HAVE ITS OWN IMMIGRATION POLICY. THIS IS A NON BINDING RESOLUTION. I DON'T THINK IT'S WORTH OUR TIME AND I WON'T BE VOTING YES. MS RUBIO YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER TODAY I RISE IN SOLIDARITY WITH MY SALVADORAN BROTHERS AND SISTERS. IN SUPPORT OF HR SIXTY NINE. AS AN IMMIGRANT MYSELF I CAN TELL YOU THAT THAT I SHARED THE STRUGGLES THAT MY SALVADORAN BROTHERS AND SISTERS HAVE. WE ALL WORK HARD OUR ACHIEVEMENTS ARE THE BY PRODUCTS OF YEARS OF BLOOD SWEAT AND TEARS EXPELLED BY OUR PARENTS AND OUR ANCESTORS BEFORE US. OUR MISSION IS TO PROVIDE THE BEST OPPORTUNITIES TO OUR FAMILIES SO THEY MEET LIVE I'D BETTER QUALITY OF LIFE. WE FIGHT TOOTH AND NAIL SO WE CAN PREVENT OUR CHILDREN FROM HAVING TO NEW INDOOR THE SAME HARDSHIPS WE ENTERED WHEN WE WERE YOUNG. AND WHETHER WE ARE ADAM ON THE FIELD DURING OFFICE SETTINGS WE POUR OUR HEARTS INTO OUR WORK BECAUSE WE TAKE PRIDE. IN HAVING AN EXCEPTIONAL WORK ETHIC. FOR ALL THOSE REASONS WE AS AMERICANS SHOULD STAND IN SOLIDARITY WITH OUR SALVADORAN BROTHERS AND SISTERS. THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I DON'T. THEY USE REAL MISTER CHáVEZ YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. YES I LIKE TO STAND IN THE SUPPORT THIS RESOLUTION. AS I'M ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES FROM MY SIDE OF THE AISLE SAID THIS IS A TEMPORARY A PROGRAM. THE FEDERAL LAW ON TEMPORARY PROTECTION STATUS. AND UNDER FEDERAL IMMIGRATION AND NATIONALIZATION ACT THE SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY MAY DESIGNATE A FOREIGN COUNTRY. FOR TEMPORARY PROTECTED STATUS DUE TO CONDITIONS THE COUNTRY THAT TEMPLATE PREVENT THE COUNTRY NATIONALS FROM RETURNING SAFELY HOME. I PULLED UP ON MY IPHONE TODAY REALLY WHAT THE THREAT LEVEL IS IN THE HOUSE OUT OF PERMISSION TO READ. WITHOUT OBJECTION. YOU GO TO THE DEPARTMENT STATE AND PULL IT OUT YOURSELF THAT SAYS. CONSIDERING TRAVELED SALVADOR DUE TO CRIME IT IS A LEVEL THREE. THE SYSTEM THAT THEY LOOK AT THE STATE IS GOES ONE THROUGH FOUR. THE HIGHER THE NUMBER THE WORSE CITY AS OF RIGHT NOW SAYS IT NOW SALVADOR. VIOLENT CRIMES SUCH AS MURDER A SONG RATE ARMED ROBBERY. IS COMMON. GANG ACTIVITIES SUCH AS EXTORTION VIOLENT STREET CRIME IN THE CAR TAX AND ARMS TRAFFICKING IS WIDESPREAD. LOCAL POLICE MAY LACK THE RESOURCE TO RESPOND EFFECTIVELY TO SERIOUS CRIMINAL INCIDENTS THIS IS ON OUR STATE WITNESS ON A FEDERAL WEBSITE. I UNDERSTAND WE DON'T MAKE FEDERAL POLICY HERE IT'S LEFT FOUR THE WASHINGTON DC. BUT THIS IS A MESSAGE FROM CALIFORNIA TO OUR LEGISLATORS. BACK IN DC TOM WHAT WE THINK. THEY MAKE CARE THEY MAY NOT CARE. BUT I THINK THIS BODY NEEDS TO LOOK AT WHAT IS THE REALITIES GOING ON IN THE WORLD. AND CLEARLY. THE THREAT THAT HAD DEL SALVADOR BEFORE WHEN WE STARTED THIS HAS NOT BEEN RESOLVED FOR A LOT OF DIFFERENT REASONS. SO I'D ASK US TO LOOK AT OUR HUMANITY ON THIS ISSUE. SUPPORT THIS RESOLUTION. THEY WISH CHAVEZ. THIS YEAR EDUARDO GARCIA YOUR RECOGNIZE THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES I STAND IN SOLIDARITY WITH OUR COLLEAGUE FROM EAGLE ROCK. SUPPORT OF HR SIXTY NINE. AND ALTHOUGH WE JUST HEARD THE GENTLEMAN FROM OCEANSIDE TALK ABOUT HUMANITY. WE'VE HEARD THE CONVERSATION ABOUT SEPARATING FAMILIES. THE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE ECONOMY I REALLY WOULD LIKE TO FOCUS JUST A BIT MORE. ON THAT PARTICULAR COMPONENT YOU SEE IN MY DISTRICT. IT IS IMMIGRANTS OF MEXICAN DESCENT AND SALVADORAN DESCENT THAT CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY WHEN IT COMES TO PEOPLE WORKING OUT IN THE FIELDS. AND TODAY MORE THAN EVER I THINK THERE IS A HUGE. RISK THAT WE. ARE CONFRONTED WITH WHEN IT COMES TO THE ECONOMIC STABILITY. OF THE AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY DUE TO THE LACK OF. CERTAINTY FOR MANY OF THE WORKERS IN THIS PARTICULAR ARENA YOU SEE. WE HAVE AN INDUSTRY. THAT IS IN JEOPARDY OF BEING DESTABILIZE SIGNIFICANTLY BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF WORKERS. AND BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF CERTAINTY WHEN IT COMES TO IMMIGRATION POLICIES BY OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. WE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. ARE VERY PROUD AND EMBRACE WHAT AGRICULTURAL DOES. FOR OUR ECONOMIES HERE IN THIS GREAT STATE. BUT WITHOUT CERTAINTY OF LABOR STABILITY. THAT. GENERATING REVENUE FOR THIS STATE WHEN IT COMES TO AGRICULTURE IS IS AT RISK. WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE OF WORKFORCE SHORTAGES IN THIS INDUSTRY AND THE SERVICE INDUSTRY. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS A COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION POLICY THAT ADDRESSES THESE CONCERNS HAVE BEEN RAISED TODAY. AND I THINK THAT WE AS CALIFORNIA IS THE SIXTH LARGEST ECONOMY THE WORLD. WE SHOULD PLAY A BIGGER ROLE IN THAT CONVERSATION IN WASHINGTON DC. AND FOR ALL THE REASONS THAT HAVE BEEN MENTIONED ALREADY THE. HUMANITARIAN SIDE. THE SEPARATION OF FAMILIES OP BUT I ALSO WOULD LIKE FOR US TO SERIOUSLY CONSIDER THE ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS. THAT THE UNCERTAINTY OF ANY IMMIGRATION POLICY HAS ON A STATE LIKE CALIFORNIA AGAIN I RESPECTFULLY SUPPORT HR SIXTY NINE LASTED ALL OF THE SUPPORT AS WELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CO.
