AS WITH ALL INDICATE WE FOUND

00:32:30.048 --> 00:32:33.385 region:rollup2
TWO MAJOR CONCERNS WITH

APPROPRIATELY.

00:32:46.364 --> 00:32:48.934 region:rollup2
SO THE FIRST KEY ISSUE

00:32:46.832 --> 00:32:50.702 region:rollup2
REGARDING.

00:32:48.934 --> 00:32:52.571 region:rollup2
WAS THAT HEALTH CARE SERVICES

AS NOT DEVELOP A PROCESS TO

00:32:52.571 --> 00:32:56.475 region:rollup2
RECOVER FUND UNSPENT ENERGY

AS OF JUNE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN.

00:32:59.611 --> 00:33:01.646 region:rollup2
WE DON'T HAVE THAT THERE WAS

00:33:00.412 --> 00:33:03.348 region:rollup2
APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED THIRTY

00:33:01.646 --> 00:33:04.983 region:rollup2
ONE MILLION THAT WOULD SUBJECT

00:33:03.348 --> 00:33:06.685 region:rollup2
TO REVERSION THAT COULD HAVE

00:33:04.983 --> 00:33:08.787 region:rollup2
BEEN REALLOCATED TO OTHER

COUNTIES. HAD HAD HEALTHCARE

SERVICES ESTABLISH A REVERSION

PROCESS.

00:33:11.256 --> 00:33:15.293 region:rollup2
ALTHOUGH THE LEGISLATURE MADE A

00:33:13.592 --> 00:33:17.462 region:rollup2
ONE TIME CHANGE IN ITS A LOT TO

00:33:15.293 --> 00:33:19.264 region:rollup2

OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES.

00:33:23.502 --> 00:33:25.570 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN SLOW TO ESTABLISH A

HEALTHCARE SERVICES INDICATED OF

00:33:29.908 --> 00:33:33.812 region:rollup2
THAT IT NEEDED REGULATIONS TO

IMPLEMENT A REVERSION PROCESS.

OTHER.

00:33:36.014 --> 00:33:40.018 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE HAD.

00:33:38.783 --> 00:33:41.586 region:rollup2
AND OUR CONCERN WAS THAT

00:33:40.018 --> 00:33:43.755 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE SERVICES HAVE BEEN IN

00:33:41.586 --> 00:33:45.690 region:rollup2
THIS ROLE OF OVERSIGHT SINCE TWO

00:33:43.755 --> 00:33:47.759 region:rollup2
THOUSAND TWELVE.

00:33:45.690 --> 00:33:49.294 region:rollup2
BOTTOM THE TIDE.

THESE REGULATIONS THAT STILL IS

00:33:53.331 --> 00:33:55.934 region:rollup2
NOT A INCLUDING THESE

00:33:54.533 --> 00:33:57.369 region:rollup2
REGULATIONS.

00:33:55.934 --> 00:33:59.404 region:rollup2
WE NEVER REALLY GOT A CLEAR

00:33:57.369 --> 00:34:00.772 region:rollup2
EXPLANATION FROM THE DEPARTMENT

00:33:59.404 --> 00:34:02.741 region:rollup2
REGARDING WHY THESE DELAYS ARE

00:34:00.772 --> 00:34:04.442 region:rollup2
OCCURRING. HOWEVER DURING THE

00:34:02.741 --> 00:34:06.244 region:rollup2
REPORT. ARE DURING THE AUDIT

00:34:04.442 --> 00:34:07.879 region:rollup2
PROCESS THE FIRST INDICATED THAT

00:34:06.244 --> 00:34:09.681 region:rollup2
THESE REGULATIONS WE ESTABLISHED

00:34:07.879 --> 00:34:11.316 region:rollup2
IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN AND

00:34:09.681 --> 00:34:12.918 region:rollup2
DECEMBER TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN.

00:34:11.316 --> 00:34:15.086 region:rollup2
THEN THEY WERE PUSHED OUT TO

00:34:12.918 --> 00:34:15.654 region:rollup2
JUNE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND

00:34:15.086 --> 00:34:17.389 region:rollup2
FINALLY WHEN THE REPORT WAS

00:34:15.654 --> 00:34:18.623 region:rollup2
ISSUED. HEALTH CARE SERVICES

00:34:17.389 --> 00:34:21.459 region:rollup2
INDICATED THAT WOULD NOT HAVE

00:34:18.623 --> 00:34:22.994 region:rollup2
THESE REGULATIONS OUT UNTL.

00:34:21.459 --> 00:34:24.529 region:rollup2
JANUARY TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN.

00:34:22.994 --> 00:34:26.498 region:rollup2
THIS CONTINUE SLIDING OF THE

00:34:24.529 --> 00:34:28.533 region:rollup2
REGULATIONS GAVE US CONCERN AND

00:34:26.498 --> 00:34:29.568 region:rollup2
PAUSE AND. AS ONE OF THE ISSUES

00:34:28.533 --> 00:34:31.136 region:rollup2
THAT WILL BE FOLLOWING UP WITH

00:34:29.568 --> 00:34:33.104 region:rollup2
AS THE REGULAR AT THE.

00:34:31.136 --> 00:34:34.839 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS COME IN.

00:34:33.104 --> 00:34:36.575 region:rollup2
.

00:34:34.839 --> 00:34:38.610 region:rollup2
ANOTHER AREA OF CONCERN THAT WE

00:34:36.575 --> 00:34:40.211 region:rollup2
WANT TO HIGHLIGHT WAS THE LEVEL

00:34:38.610 --> 00:34:41.913 region:rollup2
OF AND WHICH IS A FUNDS OF THE

00:34:40.211 --> 00:34:43.815 region:rollup2
COUNTIES ARE HOLDING A RESERVE.

00:34:41.913 --> 00:34:45.951 region:rollup2
STATE LAW ALLOWS THE COUNTIES TO

00:34:43.815 --> 00:34:47.319 region:rollup2
MAINTAIN A PRUDENT RESERVE.

00:34:45.951 --> 00:34:50.021 region:rollup2
TO ENSURE THAT.

00:34:47.319 --> 00:34:52.023 region:rollup2
FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTIES.

00:34:50.021 --> 00:34:54.292 region:rollup2
HOWEVER AS OF JUNE TWO THOUSAND

00:34:52.023 --> 00:34:55.927 region:rollup2

00:34:54.292 --> 00:34:57.395 region:rollup2
COUNTIES HAVE BEEN HELD RESERVES

00:34:55.927 --> 00:34:58.863 region:rollup2
TOLLING FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE

00:34:57.395 --> 00:35:00.665 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS.

00:34:58.863 --> 00:35:03.068 region:rollup2
WHICH IS A RESERVE OF ROUGHLY

00:35:00.665 --> 00:35:04.536 region:rollup2
FORTY SEVEN PERCENT.

00:35:03.068 --> 00:35:06.471 region:rollup2
OF THESE PRE RESERVE DOLLARS ARE

00:35:04.536 --> 00:35:07.772 region:rollup2
NOT SUBJECT TO REVERSION AND

00:35:06.471 --> 00:35:09.007 region:rollup2
THEREFORE THESE DOLLARS CAN STAY

00:35:07.772 --> 00:35:11.109 region:rollup2
WITH THE COUNTIES.

00:35:09.007 --> 00:35:14.646 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVELY INDEFINITELY.

00:35:11.109 --> 00:35:16.481 region:rollup2
THE LAW DOES NOT SPECIFY A.

00:35:14.646 --> 00:35:18.683 region:rollup2
A LOOK UP APPROPRIATE LEVEL FOR

00:35:16.481 --> 00:35:19.818 region:rollup2
THE COUNTIES TO MAINTAIN FOR

00:35:18.683 --> 00:35:21.853 region:rollup2
PRETTY RESERVE.

00:35:19.818 --> 00:35:22.420 region:rollup2
AND DIE IN THE HEALTH CARE

00:35:21.853 --> 00:35:23.688 region:rollup2
SERVICES HAS NOT ESTABLISHED

00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:25.690 region:rollup2
ONE.

00:35:23.688 --> 00:35:27.392 region:rollup2
BASED ON OUR REVIEW OF THE

00:35:25.690 --> 00:35:28.760 region:rollup2
TRENDS FOR.

00:35:27.392 --> 00:35:31.029 region:rollup2
AND WE SAY FUNDS OVER THE LAST

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:33.298 region:rollup2
TEN YEARS WE IDENTIFIED AS

00:35:31.029 --> 00:35:34.733 region:rollup2
APPROVING RESERVE LEVEL OF AT AT

00:35:33.298 --> 00:35:35.800 region:rollup2
BATS ARE THE HIGHEST THIRTY

00:35:34.733 --> 00:35:37.502 region:rollup2
THREE PERCENT.

00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:39.237 region:rollup2
FOR PRIOR YEAR BEAUTY SERVICES

VIOLENCE.

00:35:39.237 --> 00:35:42.874 region:rollup2
NOW HAD COUNTIES IMPLEMENTED A

00:35:41.272 --> 00:35:45.176 region:rollup2
RESERVE FUND OF THIRTY THREE

00:35:42.874 --> 00:35:46.578 region:rollup2
PERCENT. WE NOTED THAT.

00:35:45.176 --> 00:35:48.346 region:rollup2
THERE WOULD THEY WOULD HAVE

00:35:46.578 --> 00:35:50.048 region:rollup2
FREED UP. NEARLY A HUNDRED FIFTY

00:35:48.346 --> 00:35:51.883 region:rollup2
SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS TO PROVIDE

00:35:50.048 --> 00:35:53.752 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL SERVICES TO PROMOTE

00:35:51.883 --> 00:35:54.285 region:rollup2
AND EXPAND METAL SERVICES AT THE

00:35:53.752 --> 00:35:56.554 region:rollup2
LOCALS.

00:35:54.285 --> 00:35:58.156 region:rollup2
.

00:35:56.554 --> 00:36:00.425 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE SERVICES DISAGREED

00:35:58.156 --> 00:36:01.493 region:rollup2
WITH OUR FINDINGS AND BELIEVE

00:36:00.425 --> 00:36:02.694 region:rollup2
THAT A RANGE OF BETWEEN SIXTY

00:36:01.493 --> 00:36:03.995 region:rollup2
FOUR EIGHTY TWO PERCENT WOULD BE

00:36:02.694 --> 00:36:05.664 region:rollup2
PRUDENT.

00:36:03.995 --> 00:36:07.966 region:rollup2
WE DISAGREE WITH THAT AMOUNT AND

00:36:05.664 --> 00:36:08.433 region:rollup2
FIND THAT IT'S EXCESSIVE WOULD

00:36:07.966 --> 00:36:10.669 region:rollup2
JUST WILL.

00:36:08.433 --> 00:36:12.070 region:rollup2
INCREASE WOULD RESULT IN A

00:36:10.669 --> 00:36:13.671 region:rollup2
REDUCTION IN FUNDING AVAILABLE

IN ITS IMAGE SAY FUND.

00:36:27.686 --> 00:36:30.088 region:rollup2
AND WHETHER THE BALANCE

SINCE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE.

00:36:52.110 --> 00:36:55.747 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY WE RECOMMENDED

00:36:55.013 --> 00:36:58.083 region:rollup2
THAT BY JUNE TWO THOUSAND AND

00:36:55.747 --> 00:36:59.350 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN HEALTHCARE SERVICES. UP

PROCESS.

00:37:03.388 --> 00:37:06.958 region:rollup2
DESTRUCTIONS ON A HOW TO SPEND

A TIMELY.

00:37:19.070 --> 00:37:22.273 region:rollup2
WE ALSO RECOMMENDED THAT THE

AND THEN OVER THE PAST YEAR AND

00:45:07.271 --> 00:45:10.041 region:rollup2
THIS IS SOMETHING I PERSONALLY

00:45:08.472 --> 00:45:11.375 region:rollup2
BEEN VARYING GEISHAS WE'VE HAD

00:45:10.041 --> 00:45:12.577 region:rollup2
AN UNPRECEDENTED DIALOGUE WITH

00:45:11.375 --> 00:45:14.612 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDERS ACROSS THE COUNTY

00:45:12.577 --> 00:45:15.813 region:rollup2

ORGANIZATIONS.

00:45:17.715 --> 00:45:21.652 region:rollup2
AND AND AND BROADENING THAT

00:45:19.584 --> 00:45:23.220 region:rollup2
CIRCLE YOU KNOWS A LOT OF TIMES

00:45:21.652 --> 00:45:24.255 region:rollup2
YOU FIND YOURSELF IN ROOMS ARE

00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:25.356 region:rollup2
SURE YOU'LL NEVER EXPERIENCE

00:45:24.255 --> 00:45:27.858 region:rollup2
THIS WHERE IT'S A LOT OF THE

00:45:25.356 --> 00:45:28.392 region:rollup2
SAME FACES YOU KNOW AND WE HAVE

00:45:27.858 --> 00:45:29.227 region:rollup2
TEN MILLION PEOPLE IN OUR

00:45:28.392 --> 00:45:30.461 region:rollup2
COUNTY.

00:45:29.227 --> 00:45:31.395 region:rollup2
SO WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO

00:45:30.461 --> 00:45:32.630 region:rollup2
BROADEN THAT DIALOGUES ARE

00:45:31.395 --> 00:45:34.332 region:rollup2
BRINGING MORE PEOPLE INTO THIS

00:45:32.630 --> 00:45:36.968 region:rollup2
EQUATION BECAUSE I HAVE YET TO

00:45:34.332 --> 00:45:38.769 region:rollup2
FIND A FAMILY THAT IS NOT

00:45:36.968 --> 00:45:40.171 region:rollup2
TOUCHED BY MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES.

00:45:38.769 --> 00:45:40.905 region:rollup2
SO HOW DO ARE DOWN ON A COUPLE

00:45:40.171 --> 00:45:42.039 region:rollup2
OF THESE AREAS SHORTLY BUT I

00:45:40.905 --> 00:45:44.075 region:rollup2
ALSO WANT TO STRESS THAT THE

00:45:42.039 --> 00:45:45.676 region:rollup2
COUNTIES THE OIC AND THE STATE

00:45:44.075 --> 00:45:47.345 region:rollup2
AND IN OUR MIND NEED TO WORK

00:45:45.676 --> 00:45:48.446 region:rollup2
TOGETHER TO CREATE A SEAMLESS

00:45:47.345 --> 00:45:49.680 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

00:45:48.446 --> 00:45:50.815 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW WE HAVE THE STATE

00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:53.484 region:rollup2
SPEECH HIEF ROLE OF

00:45:50.815 --> 00:45:55.720 region:rollup2
DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDS THE OIC

00:45:53.484 --> 00:45:57.121 region:rollup2
CREATING LINKAGES IN AFRICA.

00:45:55.720 --> 00:45:58.422 region:rollup2
EVALUATING EFFECTIVENESS

00:45:57.121 --> 00:46:00.124 region:rollup2
AND THE COUNTIES PROVIDING

00:45:58.422 --> 00:46:02.193 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE SERVICES.

00:46:00.124 --> 00:46:03.661 region:rollup2
THAT SAME BROAD STROKES ALL OF

00:46:02.193 --> 00:46:05.730 region:rollup2
THAT IS OCCURRING BUT.

00:46:03.661 --> 00:46:07.231 region:rollup2
THERE ARE ISSUES AND SYSTEMS

00:46:05.730 --> 00:46:09.333 region:rollup2
THAT ARE CREATING BARRIERS AT

00:46:07.231 --> 00:46:10.735 region:rollup2
ALL LEVELS AND THE

00:46:09.333 --> 00:46:12.536 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS IN THIS REPORT.

00:46:10.735 --> 00:46:13.838 region:rollup2
SHOW HOW SOME OF THAT ALIGNMENT

00:46:12.536 --> 00:46:14.839 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN LACKING AND THE WE ARE

00:46:13.838 --> 00:46:16.807 region:rollup2
AND ALWAYS GROWING IN THE SAME

00:46:14.839 --> 00:46:17.408 region:rollup2
DIRECTION.

00:46:16.807 --> 00:46:19.110 region:rollup2
AND FOR A COUNTY PERSPECTIVE.

00:46:17.408 --> 00:46:20.511 region:rollup2
.

00:46:19.110 --> 00:46:21.879 region:rollup2
IF WE LOOK AT THE STATE WE LOOK

00:46:20.511 --> 00:46:23.514 region:rollup2
AT THE STATE WIDE ENTITIES TO

00:46:21.879 --> 00:46:25.249 region:rollup2
HELP US FOSTER AN ENVIRONMENT

00:46:23.514 --> 00:46:26.817 region:rollup2
WHERE OUR CLIENTS. DON'T HAVE TO

00:46:25.249 --> 00:46:28.552 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT WORK PROGRAMS WILL

00:46:26.817 --> 00:46:30.054 region:rollup2
PROVIDE THE SERVICES THEY NEED

00:46:28.552 --> 00:46:31.389 region:rollup2
AND EVEN MORE DAUNTING WHAT

00:46:30.054 --> 00:46:33.324 region:rollup2
FUNDING STREAMS WILL PROVIDE

00:46:31.389 --> 00:46:35.192 region:rollup2
THOSE SERVICES. BUT EVERYDAY I

00:46:33.324 --> 00:46:36.527 region:rollup2
TALK TO CLIENTS AND FAMILIES AND

00:46:35.192 --> 00:46:37.928 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE HAD TO LEARN THE

00:46:36.527 --> 00:46:40.331 region:rollup2
SYSTEM IN TERMS OF ALL OF THE

00:46:37.928 --> 00:46:41.365 region:rollup2
ACRONYMS IN TERMS OF WHICH FUNDS

00:46:40.331 --> 00:46:42.199 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF WHAT PROGRAMS. THEY

00:46:41.365 --> 00:46:43.901 region:rollup2
SHOULDN'T HAVE TO THINK ABOUT

00:46:42.199 --> 00:46:44.402 region:rollup2
THAT THEY SHOULD THINK ABOUT

00:46:43.901 --> 00:46:45.803 region:rollup2
WHAT THEY NEED TO BECOME

00:46:44.402 --> 00:46:46.871 region:rollup2
HEALTHY.

00:46:45.803 --> 00:46:48.072 region:rollup2
AND NOT SEEK WE SEEM TO HAVE PUT

00:46:46.871 --> 00:46:49.774 region:rollup2
THEM INTO A SYSTEM WHERE THEY

00:46:48.072 --> 00:46:51.642 region:rollup2
HAVE TO UNDERSTAND. THE

00:46:49.774 --> 00:46:52.910 region:rollup2
BUREAUCRACY SOMETIMES TO GET

00:46:51.642 --> 00:46:54.011 region:rollup2
THOSE SERVICES AND THAT'S

00:46:52.910 --> 00:46:55.413 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATE WE NEED TO CHANGE

00:46:54.011 --> 00:46:57.014 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:46:55.413 --> 00:46:58.649 region:rollup2
SO WE'RE ONLY TO DO A BETTER JOB

00:46:57.014 --> 00:47:00.084 region:rollup2
I THINK THE COUNTIES NEED TO

00:46:58.649 --> 00:47:02.086 region:rollup2
LOOK TO THE STATE TO STREAMLINE

00:47:00.084 --> 00:47:03.254 region:rollup2
PROPHECIES PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN

00:47:02.086 --> 00:47:04.689 region:rollup2
TERMS OF REGULATIONS AND

00:47:03.254 --> 00:47:06.524 region:rollup2
ESTABLISH POLICIES THAT CREATE A

00:47:04.689 --> 00:47:07.758 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE. THAT SUPPORTS

00:47:06.524 --> 00:47:09.126 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE AND ACCOUNTABLE USE OF

00:47:07.758 --> 00:47:10.761 region:rollup2
FUNDS.

00:47:09.126 --> 00:47:12.296 region:rollup2
WE ALSO NEED TO LOOK TO THE OIC

00:47:10.761 --> 00:47:13.531 region:rollup2
TO SUPPORT THE RELATIONSHIP

00:47:12.296 --> 00:47:15.066 region:rollup2
BETWEEN THE STATE CREATE

00:47:13.531 --> 00:47:17.334 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES FOR COLLABORATION

00:47:15.066 --> 00:47:19.136 region:rollup2
AND MODELS OF EXCELLENCE WHICH

00:47:17.334 --> 00:47:20.404 region:rollup2
QUITE RECENTLY LA COUNTY HAS.

00:47:19.136 --> 00:47:21.605 region:rollup2
I HAD A REALLY POSITIVE

00:47:20.404 --> 00:47:23.774 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCEIN TERMS OF

00:47:21.605 --> 00:47:26.043 region:rollup2
INNOVATION THAT WE HAVE WORKED

00:47:23.774 --> 00:47:27.678 region:rollup2
WITH A KEY PARTNERS KERN COUNTY

00:47:26.043 --> 00:47:29.580 region:rollup2
BUT OTHER COUNTIES AS WELL. TO

00:47:27.678 --> 00:47:30.681 region:rollup2
ASSIST IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN

00:47:29.580 --> 00:47:32.116 region:rollup2
INNOVATION SWEET WHICH WERE

00:47:30.681 --> 00:47:34.385 region:rollup2
REALLY EXCITED ABOUT SO WE'VE

00:47:32.116 --> 00:47:34.952 region:rollup2
SEEN THAT REALIZED VERY CLOSELY

00:47:34.385 --> 00:47:36.520 region:rollup2
IN COLLABORATION WITH THE LA

00:47:34.952 --> 00:47:38.356 region:rollup2
CITY.

00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:39.490 region:rollup2
AND IN A MOST IMPORTANTLY WE

00:47:38.356 --> 00:47:40.624 region:rollup2
HAVE TO AS I MENTIONED BEFORE

00:47:39.490 --> 00:47:42.560 region:rollup2
SERVE ALL OF OUR RESIDENTS

00:47:40.624 --> 00:47:43.527 region:rollup2
SUPERVISORS THAT PROMOTE MENTAL

00:47:42.560 --> 00:47:45.029 region:rollup2
HEALTH AND WELL BEING AND NOT

00:47:43.527 --> 00:47:46.497 region:rollup2
HAVE TO HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT

00:47:45.029 --> 00:47:48.165 region:rollup2
THESE INTRICACIES.

00:47:46.497 --> 00:47:49.233 region:rollup2
SO I'D SAY FINALLY IN TERMS OF

00:47:48.165 --> 00:47:50.901 region:rollup2
THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE

00:47:49.233 --> 00:47:52.603 region:rollup2
WOULD LOOK TO.

00:47:50.901 --> 00:47:54.004 region:rollup2
THE FUNDS NEED TO BE FLEXIBLE TO

00:47:52.603 --> 00:47:55.773 region:rollup2
ADDRESS DEVELOPMENTS IN THE

00:47:54.004 --> 00:47:57.808 region:rollup2
FIELD. AND FUN THINGS.

00:47:55.773 --> 00:47:59.110 region:rollup2
THAT THAT ARE BENT AND FUNDS

00:47:57.808 --> 00:48:00.544 region:rollup2
BEYOND THOSE THAT ARE MARKED FOR

00:47:59.110 --> 00:48:02.079 region:rollup2
INNOVATION HAVE TO BE LOOKING AT

00:48:00.544 --> 00:48:03.647 region:rollup2
INNOVATIONS WE NEED TO ADDRESS

00:48:02.079 --> 00:48:05.616 region:rollup2
PRESSING NEEDS SUCH AS IN OUR

00:48:03.647 --> 00:48:06.217 region:rollup2
CARE IN OUR COUNTY HOMELESSNESS.

00:48:05.616 --> 00:48:07.785 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW NOT THAT WERE ONLY

00:48:06.217 --> 00:48:09.553 region:rollup2
ALLOWED IN THAT BUT AS EVERYONE

00:48:07.785 --> 00:48:10.888 region:rollup2
KNOWS MENTALLY COUNTY HAS A

00:48:09.553 --> 00:48:12.757 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR CHALLENGE THEIR AND

FOURTEEN YEARS AFTER PASSAGE

00:59:58.428 --> 01:00:02.799 region:rollup2
I FIND MYSELF THINKING THAT THE

01:00:00.263 --> 01:00:04.568 region:rollup2
MHSAA IS IN MANY WAYS A TALE OF

01:00:02.799 --> 01:00:06.903 region:rollup2
TWO CITIES.

01:00:04.568 --> 01:00:08.738 region:rollup2
ON THE ONE HAND IT IS ARGUABLY

01:00:06.903 --> 01:00:09.606 region:rollup2
ONE OF CALIFORNIA'S GREATEST

01:00:08.738 --> 01:00:12.242 region:rollup2

01:00:09.606 --> 01:00:13.510 region:rollup2
ACHIEVEMENTS.

YOU REMEMBER IN THOSE DIFFICULT

01:00:13.510 --> 01:00:17.781 region:rollup2
YEARS BEFORE PROP SIXTY THREE.

01:00:15.812 --> 01:00:19.950 region:rollup2
THERE WAS NO CONTINUE I'M A

01:00:17.781 --> 01:00:21.384 region:rollup2
MENTAL HEALTH CARE TO SPEAK UP.

01:00:19.950 --> 01:00:22.919 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA HAD EMPTIED OUT ITS

01:00:21.384 --> 01:00:24.221 region:rollup2
PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITALS WITH THE

01:00:22.919 --> 01:00:26.089 region:rollup2
PROMISE OF BUILDING A FULL

01:00:24.221 --> 01:00:28.825 region:rollup2
SPECTRUM OF COMPASSIONATE

01:00:26.089 --> 01:00:30.393 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY BASED CARE.

01:00:28.825 --> 01:00:32.229 region:rollup2
BUT OUR LEADERS NEVER FOLLOWED

01:00:30.393 --> 01:00:34.598 region:rollup2
THROUGH ON THAT COMMITMENT.

01:00:32.229 --> 01:00:35.699 region:rollup2
INSTEAD WE GOT BUDGET CUTS.

01:00:34.598 --> 01:00:37.367 region:rollup2
WE HAD PEOPLE IN CRISIS AND KNOW

01:00:35.699 --> 01:00:38.668 region:rollup2
WHERE TO TREAT THEM.

01:00:37.367 --> 01:00:40.670 region:rollup2
OUR STREETS IN JAILS AND

01:00:38.668 --> 01:00:42.672 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY ROOMS BECAME TREATMENT

01:00:40.670 --> 01:00:43.673 region:rollup2
CENTER AS OF LAST RESORT.

01:00:42.672 --> 01:00:45.942 region:rollup2
FAMILIES HAD NOWHERE TO TURN FOR

01:00:43.673 --> 01:00:47.744 region:rollup2
HOPE.

01:00:45.942 --> 01:00:49.279 region:rollup2
AGAINST THAT BACKDROP.

01:00:47.744 --> 01:00:50.981 region:rollup2

01:00:58.555 --> 01:01:01.424 region:rollup2
DOLLARS.

01:01:00.056 --> 01:01:02.125 region:rollup2

01:01:24.748 --> 01:01:28.618 region:rollup2

BIGGER IMPACT.

01:03:52.262 --> 01:03:56.299 region:rollup2
YES

COULD. BE MAKING AN EVEN BIGGER

01:03:57.867 --> 01:04:01.504 region:rollup2

SERVICES REMAIN FOCUSED

01:04:28.131 --> 01:04:31.868 region:rollup2
PRIMARILY ON THE BACK END OF

CARE ON PEOPLE WHO ARE HOMELESS

01:04:31.868 --> 01:04:35.004 region:rollup2

DID NOT HAVE ACCESS.

01:04:35.004 --> 01:04:38.308 region:rollup2
I CARE ON THE FRONT END AT STAGE

01:04:36.172 --> 01:04:39.576 region:rollup2
ONE.

01:04:38.308 --> 01:04:41.811 region:rollup2
MORE THAN A DECADE AFTER PROP

01:04:39.576 --> 01:04:44.013 region:rollup2
SIXTY THREES PASSAGE WE HAVE NO

WIDE STRATEGIC VISION FOR MENTAL

01:04:46.049 --> 01:04:49.452 region:rollup2
HEALTH SPENDING.

01:04:47.684 --> 01:04:50.987 region:rollup2
WE HAVE NO SYSTEM FOR COMPARING

01:04:49.452 --> 01:04:52.822 region:rollup2
IN SHARING OUTCOMES.

01:04:50.987 --> 01:04:54.390 region:rollup2
WE HAVE.

01:04:52.822 --> 01:04:56.059 region:rollup2
WE LACK THE CENTRALIZED

01:04:54.390 --> 01:04:58.061 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY TO ENSURE THIS

01:04:56.059 --> 01:05:00.130 region:rollup2
UNPRECEDENTED TWO POINT TWO

BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT. IS

01:05:00.130 --> 01:05:04.200 region:rollup2

EFFECTIVELY ON SERVICES WITH

01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:07.904 region:rollup2
MEASURABLE OUTCOMES.

01:05:06.636 --> 01:05:09.272 region:rollup2
AND WE STILL HAVE FIFTY EIGHT

COUNTIES DOING THINGS FIFTY

01:05:09.272 --> 01:05:13.643 region:rollup2
EIGHT WAYS.

01:05:11.541 --> 01:05:15.445 region:rollup2
IN SHORT WE HAVE A FAILURE NOT

01:05:13.643 --> 01:05:18.148 region:rollup2
OF FUNDING OR INTENT.

01:05:15.445 --> 01:05:19.849 region:rollup2

DILIGENTLY TRYING TO CARRY OUT

THEIR MISSION.

01:05:30.026 --> 01:05:32.529 region:rollup2
BUT IT ALSO FINDS PROGRESS

01:05:31.261 --> 01:05:34.130 region:rollup2
TOWARD THAT MISSION HAS BEEN

01:05:32.529 --> 01:05:36.566 region:rollup2
HAMPERED BY INEFFECTIVE

01:05:34.130 --> 01:05:38.301 region:rollup2
LEADERSHIP AND OVERSIGHT.

01:05:36.566 --> 01:05:40.370 region:rollup2
WE AGREE WITHOUT FINDING

01:05:38.301 --> 01:05:42.705 region:rollup2

OF OUR TIME.

01:05:46.910 --> 01:05:50.113 region:rollup2
AND THE ONLY THING THAT IS GOING

01:05:48.211 --> 01:05:52.182 region:rollup2
TO CHANGE THAT IS STRONG AND

01:05:50.113 --> 01:05:53.316 region:rollup2
CONSISTENT LEADERSHIP AT EVERY

01:05:52.182 --> 01:05:55.318 region:rollup2
LEVEL OF STATE AND LOCAL

GOVERNMENT.

01:05:55.318 --> 01:05:58.621 region:rollup2
AS THE AUDIT NOTES HUNDREDS OF

01:05:57.487 --> 01:06:00.490 region:rollup2
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS HAVE GONE

01:05:58.621 --> 01:06:02.258 region:rollup2
UNSPENT BECAUSE COUNTIES ARE

01:06:00.490 --> 01:06:03.526 region:rollup2
UNCLEAR. ABOUT HOW TO SPEND

01:06:02.258 --> 01:06:06.029 region:rollup2

01:06:12.869 --> 01:06:16.272 region:rollup2
IS THE FOURTH EVALUATION TO

RAISE SERIOUS QUESTIONS ABOUT

01:06:16.272 --> 01:06:18.942 region:rollup2
THE STATE'S FAILURE TO OVER

01:06:18.942 --> 01:06:23.379 region:rollup2
AND DIRECT MHSAA SPENDING.

01:06:21.444 --> 01:06:25.615 region:rollup2
THE TIME HAS COME TO TAKE A HARD

01:06:23.379 --> 01:06:28.318 region:rollup2
LOOK AT OUR LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE

01:06:25.615 --> 01:06:29.552 region:rollup2
AND TO DEMAND BETTER.

01:06:28.318 --> 01:06:31.120 region:rollup2
WE BELIEVE THAT TAKING OUR

01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:35.158 region:rollup2
SORRY WE BELIEVE THAT TAKING OUR

01:06:36.860 --> 01:06:40.630 region:rollup2
FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE IN LEADERSHIP

01:06:38.394 --> 01:06:42.098 region:rollup2
APPROACH.

01:06:40.630 --> 01:06:44.968 region:rollup2

RESEARCHING THIS ISSUE.

01:06:58.381 --> 01:07:02.118 region:rollup2
THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT WE DON'T

01:07:00.049 --> 01:07:04.120 region:rollup2
HAVE TO START FROM SCRATCH.

01:07:02.118 --> 01:07:05.688 region:rollup2
THE ANSWERS ARE OUT THERE.

01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:07.423 region:rollup2

01:10:28.891 --> 01:10:32.662 region:rollup2
MANY WAYS BECAUSE TEXAS IS NOT

01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:34.130 region:rollup2

PERFECTLY AND NOW I'M HERE

01:10:41.270 --> 01:10:43.940 region:rollup2

01:10:45.608 --> 01:10:48.811 region:rollup2
BEING A PERFECT EXAMPLE THAT

01:10:47.076 --> 01:10:49.345 region:rollup2
REALLY ISN'T AS FAR ALONG

01:10:48.811 --> 01:10:51.180 region:rollup2
HEARING CALIFORNIA'S IT IS

01:10:49.345 --> 01:10:53.049 region:rollup2
THERE.

01:10:51.180 --> 01:10:54.484 region:rollup2
SO ONE OF THE THINGS IN MY

01:10:53.049 --> 01:10:56.219 region:rollup2
BACKGROUND IS I'M A LIBRARIAN

01:10:54.484 --> 01:10:58.788 region:rollup2
AND I'M ALWAYS LOOKING AT MODELS

01:10:56.219 --> 01:11:00.490 region:rollup2
AROUND THIS THE COUNTRY AN AND

01:10:58.788 --> 01:11:02.158 region:rollup2
SEEING HOW GOVERNMENT CAN BE.

01:11:00.490 --> 01:11:04.193 region:rollup2

01:11:13.636 --> 01:11:15.972 region:rollup2
MAJORITY OF COUNTIES HERE IN

01:11:14.737 --> 01:11:17.206 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA HAVE THE INTEGRATION

01:11:15.972 --> 01:11:18.741 region:rollup2

01:11:34.357 --> 01:11:37.860 region:rollup2
THAT DOES THAT COMBINATION

01:11:36.259 --> 01:11:39.128 region:rollup2

01:16:09.765 --> 01:16:13.369 region:rollup2
A CUP PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD.

01:16:12.334 --> 01:16:15.171 region:rollup2
THEY GO BEFORE THE BOARD OF

01:16:13.369 --> 01:16:16.639 region:rollup2
SUPERVISORS THAT TALK ABOUT THAT

01:16:15.171 --> 01:16:17.907 region:rollup2
PLAN GET APPROVAL AND THEN THEY

01:16:16.639 --> 01:16:19.542 region:rollup2
GO TO THAT.

01:16:17.907 --> 01:16:20.910 region:rollup2
OVERSIGHT ACCOUNTABILITY

01:16:19.542 --> 01:16:22.745 region:rollup2
COMMISSION AND FOR FINAL

01:16:20.910 --> 01:16:24.713 region:rollup2
APPROVAL. AND SO IF THE

01:16:22.745 --> 01:16:25.781 region:rollup2
COMMISSION SAYS NO WE DON'T LIKE

01:16:24.713 --> 01:16:27.616 region:rollup2
YOUR PLAN.

01:16:25.781 --> 01:16:28.217 region:rollup2
TYPICALLY THAT COMMISSION WOULD

01:16:27.616 --> 01:16:29.718 region:rollup2
GIVE.

01:16:28.217 --> 01:16:31.454 region:rollup2
REASONS OF WE DO NOT THINK THEY

01:16:29.718 --> 01:16:34.090 region:rollup2
WOULD GIVE AYE INPUT AS TO WHAT

01:16:31.454 --> 01:16:35.558 region:rollup2
THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE CHANGED.

01:16:34.090 --> 01:16:36.592 region:rollup2
AND THE COUNTY'S BASICALLY HAVE

01:16:35.558 --> 01:16:39.161 region:rollup2
TO GO BACK AND.

01:16:36.592 --> 01:16:40.896 region:rollup2
AND OF.

01:16:39.161 --> 01:16:42.698 region:rollup2
WORK ON THAT.

01:16:40.896 --> 01:16:45.134 region:rollup2
THAT PROPOSAL AND THEN COME BACK

01:16:42.698 --> 01:16:47.870 region:rollup2
AGAIN YES HAS THIS BEEN A REASON

01:16:45.134 --> 01:16:49.505 region:rollup2
FOR. SOME OF THE FUNDS.

01:16:47.870 --> 01:16:52.174 region:rollup2
ACCUMULATING WITHOUT BEING SPENT

01:16:49.505 --> 01:16:53.742 region:rollup2
THIS PROCESS OF TRYING SOMETHING

01:16:52.174 --> 01:16:54.577 region:rollup2
AND THEN GETTING A KICK BACK.

01:16:53.742 --> 01:16:56.078 region:rollup2
FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND I I

01:16:54.577 --> 01:16:57.446 region:rollup2
<u>OULDN'T.</u>

01:16:56.078 --> 01:16:59.281 region:rollup2
DOUBT IT BUT FROM WHAT I

01:16:57.446 --> 01:17:01.283 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND NINETY PERCENT OF THE

01:16:59.281 --> 01:17:03.486 region:rollup2
INNOVATION PROPOSALS THAT COME

01:17:01.283 --> 01:17:05.087 region:rollup2
BEFORE THE OECD ARE APPROVED.

01:17:03.486 --> 01:17:06.755 region:rollup2
NOW I DON'T KNOW IF THAT MEANS

01:17:05.087 --> 01:17:08.624 region:rollup2
IT DOESN'T MEAN THERE'S A COUPLE

01:17:06.755 --> 01:17:09.525 region:rollup2
AT BATS BEFORE THAT APPROVAL

01:17:08.624 --> 01:17:12.394 region:rollup2
HAPPENS BUT.

01:17:09.525 --> 01:17:15.297 region:rollup2
I'M.

01:17:12.394 --> 01:17:15.898 region:rollup2
YOU MAY HAVE A DIFFERENT WAY I'D

01:17:15.297 --> 01:17:16.999 region:rollup2
LIKE YEAH. I CAN SAY THAT A

01:17:15.898 --> 01:17:19.101 region:rollup2
THERE'S ALSO THERE'S ACTUALLY A

01:17:16.999 --> 01:17:21.170 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL STEPS IN THE PROCESS

01:17:19.101 --> 01:17:21.770 region:rollup2
OF HAVING TO GO BEFORE MENTAL

01:17:21.170 --> 01:17:23.772 region:rollup2
HEALTH SERVICES ACT STEERING

01:17:21.770 --> 01:17:24.473 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE. HAVING NO BEFORE THE

01:17:23.772 --> 01:17:25.174 region:rollup2
MENTAL HEALTH BOARD OF THE

01:17:24.473 --> 01:17:27.042 region:rollup2
COUNTY.

01:17:25.174 --> 01:17:27.977 region:rollup2
BEFORE EVEN GETTING TO THE

01:17:27.042 --> 01:17:30.646 region:rollup2
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS

01:17:27.977 --> 01:17:33.315 region:rollup2
SO IT IS QUITE CUMBERSOME AND.

01:17:30.646 --> 01:17:34.617 region:rollup2
IT DOES NOT EXACTLY SPEED UP

01:17:33.315 --> 01:17:36.185 region:rollup2
THE FLOW OF THE MONEY YEAH I SEE

01:17:34.617 --> 01:17:37.486 region:rollup2
A RATHER LENGTHY PROCESS AND

01:17:36.185 --> 01:17:40.256 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHY I'M. ASKING SOME

01:17:37.486 --> 01:17:41.891 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS ON WHAT CAN WE DO.

01:17:40.256 --> 01:17:43.626 region:rollup2
THE CAMERA MOVES ALONG BECAUSE I

01:17:41.891 --> 01:17:44.927 region:rollup2
SEE A PARALYSIS ICF FEAR OF A

01:17:43.626 --> 01:17:46.328 region:rollup2
LIABILITY EXPOSURE BUT IF WE DO

01:17:44.927 --> 01:17:48.664 region:rollup2
SOMETHING AND THEN.

01:17:46.328 --> 01:17:50.299 region:rollup2
SOMETHING SOMEBODY SUSAN SAYS

01:17:48.664 --> 01:17:51.901 region:rollup2
YOU SHOULDN'T BEEN USING PROP

01:17:50.299 --> 01:17:54.236 region:rollup2
SIXTY THREE FOR FOR THIS OR FOR

01:17:51.901 --> 01:17:55.471 region:rollup2
THAT WERE SENIOR RIGHT NOW WITH

01:17:54.236 --> 01:17:56.572 region:rollup2
NO PLACE LIKE HOME JUSTIN'S ARE

01:17:55.471 --> 01:17:57.907 region:rollup2
TIGHT AROUND SUPERIOR COURT

01:17:56.572 --> 01:17:59.408 region:rollup2
SACRAMENTO BECAUSE WANNA. BUILD

01:17:57.907 --> 01:18:01.577 region:rollup2
NEEDED HOUSING AND NOW WE'VE GOT

01:17:59.408 --> 01:18:03.112 region:rollup2
ONE PERSON WHO'S YOU KNOW

01:18:01.577 --> 01:18:04.847 region:rollup2
HOLDING IT UP AT ALL THAT.

01:18:03.112 --> 01:18:05.781 region:rollup2
SO I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

01:18:04.847 --> 01:18:06.749 region:rollup2
WHERE YOU KNOW WITH THIS LOGJAM

01:18:05.781 --> 01:18:10.386 region:rollup2
WORSE TO PRUNE JUICE YOU KNOW

01:18:06.749 --> 01:18:14.557 region:rollup2
WHAT WE. WHAT WE DO AT TRYIN?

01:18:10.386 --> 01:18:21.664 region:rollup2
FREE THINGS UP A LITTLE.

01:18:14.557 --> 01:18:24.867 region:rollup2
MULDER NOW THAT THEY'VE HAD.

01:18:21.664 --> 01:18:26.602 region:rollup2
IF YOU LOOK AT.

01:18:24.867 --> 01:18:28.204 region:rollup2
WELL AGAIN I THINK YOU'LL HEAR.

01:18:26.602 --> 01:18:29.171 region:rollup2
FROM TOBY EWING AS SOON WHO

01:18:28.204 --> 01:18:30.773 region:rollup2
WILL BE ABLE TO GO INTO DEPTH

01:18:29.171 --> 01:18:31.373 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE WORK THEY'RE DOING.

01:18:30.773 --> 01:18:32.341 region:rollup2
THEY RECENTLY.

01:18:31.373 --> 01:18:33.108 region:rollup2
HOSTED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH US

01:18:32.341 --> 01:18:33.742 region:rollup2
SEVERAL DIFFERENT GROUPS AND

01:18:33.108 --> 01:18:36.011 region:rollup2
INNOVATION SUMMIT THAT BROUGHT

01:18:33.742 --> 01:18:38.414 region:rollup2
REALLY CALIFORNIA'S LEADERS INTO

01:18:36.011 --> 01:18:39.014 region:rollup2
THE SAME ROOM WHERE THEY BEGAN

01:18:38.414 --> 01:18:40.082 region:rollup2
TO TALK ABOUT REALLY JUST FROM

01:18:39.014 --> 01:18:41.951 region:rollup2
THE.

01:18:40.082 --> 01:18:43.285 region:rollup2
NOT BASIC POINT OF WHAT IS

01:18:41.951 --> 01:18:44.353 region:rollup2
INNOVATION AND I THINK THAT'S A

01:18:43.285 --> 01:18:46.422 region:rollup2
POINT THAT REALLY NEEDS TO BE

01:18:44.353 --> 01:18:47.923 region:rollup2

SOME STREAMLINING THAT COULD BE

01:18:59.835 --> 01:19:03.239 region:rollup2
DONE AND I. I THINK THAT THAT WE

01:19:02.338 --> 01:19:04.773 region:rollup2
SEE IS WORKING ON.

01:19:03.239 --> 01:19:06.542 region:rollup2
TOWARD THAT.

01:19:04.773 --> 01:19:08.544 region:rollup2

THOSE STUDIES THERE WAS JUST A

01:23:20.162 --> 01:23:23.398 region:rollup2
BRILLIANT.

01:23:20.863 --> 01:23:25.667 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE MEETING THAT TALK ALL

01:23:23.398 --> 01:23:28.971 region:rollup2
ABOUT ACES ADVERSE CHILDHOOD

01:23:25.667 --> 01:23:30.506 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCES AND FROM THAT WE WE

01:23:28.971 --> 01:23:33.375 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT.

01:23:30.506 --> 01:23:33.876 region:rollup2
WERE ABLE TO IDENTIFY PEOPLE

01:23:33.375 --> 01:23:35.978 region:rollup2
EARLY IN THEIR LIVES AND

01:23:33.876 --> 01:23:38.080 region:rollup2

OF SUPPORT AND CARE THEY NEED

THEY GET TO THRIVE. THEY GET TO

01:23:41.383 --> 01:23:44.386 region:rollup2
THRIVE IN THEIR LIFE SO THAT'S

01:23:42.618 --> 01:23:46.288 region:rollup2
WHAT TEN OH FOUR IS WE HAVE A

01:23:44.386 --> 01:23:48.924 region:rollup2
WHOLE BILL LISTS A AND WITH

01:23:46.288 --> 01:23:50.759 region:rollup2
ABOUT SEVEN TOP PRIORITIES

01:23:48.924 --> 01:23:52.861 region:rollup2
CHANNEL FOUR IS OUR TOP. BUT I

01:23:50.759 --> 01:23:56.398 region:rollup2
THINK MORE DIRECTION AND THEN

01:23:52.861 --> 01:23:58.367 region:rollup2
BESIDES THAT IS UNTIL LOOK TO

01:23:56.398 --> 01:24:00.235 region:rollup2
THE STATE SO I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT

01:23:58.367 --> 01:24:01.904 region:rollup2
NEW NEW JERSEY THAT WHAT IT WAS

01:24:00.235 --> 01:24:04.740 region:rollup2
I WILL LOOK INTO THAT. AT LIKE

01:24:01.904 --> 01:24:07.843 region:rollup2

01:24:07.843 --> 01:24:10.379 region:rollup2
SO WE NEED.

01:24:08.777 --> 01:24:12.114 region:rollup2
AND WHAT THE AUDIT REALLY

01:24:10.379 --> 01:24:14.416 region:rollup2
FOCUSES ON IS LEADERSHIP.

01:24:12.114 --> 01:24:15.651 region:rollup2
AND WE THINK THAT'S TRUE WHEN WE

01:24:14.416 --> 01:24:19.154 region:rollup2
ARE READ THROUGH THE AUDIT.

01:24:15.651 --> 01:24:20.689 region:rollup2

LACK LUSTER.

01:24:27.696 --> 01:24:32.801 region:rollup2

01:24:31.199 --> 01:24:35.203 region:rollup2
THOSE WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR

01:24:32.801 --> 01:24:38.240 region:rollup2

HAVE IS THAT.

01:25:39.301 --> 01:25:43.605 region:rollup2
WHEN THE EMMY TO SAVE US PASSED

PROGRAM AS WELL FOR MENTAL

01:26:02.658 --> 01:26:07.629 region:rollup2
HEALTH SERVICES.

01:26:04.292 --> 01:26:08.697 region:rollup2
AS WELL AND OF COURSE THAT.

01:26:07.629 --> 01:26:10.432 region:rollup2
IS DONE THE.

01:26:08.697 --> 01:26:12.267 region:rollup2
UNDER A DIFFERENT SET OF RULES

01:26:10.432 --> 01:26:13.769 region:rollup2
AND SOME SENSES AND HOW ONE CAN

01:26:12.267 --> 01:26:16.004 region:rollup2
ARGUE ABOUT THE LEVEL OF

01:26:13.769 --> 01:26:17.806 region:rollup2
OVERSIGHT OVER THAT IN TERMS OF

01:26:16.004 --> 01:26:20.842 region:rollup2
OF THAT IN TERMS OF.

01:26:17.806 --> 01:26:22.577 region:rollup2
RESPONSIVE THE STATE ARE SO SO

01:26:20.842 --> 01:26:23.745 region:rollup2
FIRST QUESTION I HAVE IS FOR

01:26:22.577 --> 01:26:25.147 region:rollup2
SPECIALLY THE COUNTY.

01:26:23.745 --> 01:26:25.881 region:rollup2
WE HAVE VARIOUS CAL YEARS IS

01:26:25.147 --> 01:26:28.884 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:26:25.881 --> 01:26:30.686 region:rollup2
WHAT DO YOU SEE AS HOW WE

01:26:28.884 --> 01:26:31.787 region:rollup2
INTEGRATE?

01:26:30.686 --> 01:26:33.221 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF TRYING TO GET TO.

01:26:31.787 --> 01:26:35.023 region:rollup2
THINKING ABOUT WHAT IS OUR

01:26:33.221 --> 01:26:36.658 region:rollup2
MENTAL HEALTH GOALS OVERALL I

01:26:35.023 --> 01:26:39.061 region:rollup2
THINK THAT WE SHOULD

01:26:36.658 --> 01:26:40.195 region:rollup2
YEAH AND IT WAS TOUCHED ON ABOUT

01:26:39.061 --> 01:26:41.163 region:rollup2
FUNDING STREAMS AND SO FORTH YOU

01:26:40.195 --> 01:26:42.531 region:rollup2
HAVE MHSAA MONEY YOU HAVE

01:26:41.163 --> 01:26:43.632 region:rollup2
MEDICAID MONEY.

01:26:42.531 --> 01:26:44.766 region:rollup2
FOR MENTAL HEALTH YOU GOT SOME

01:26:43.632 --> 01:26:46.968 region:rollup2
OTHER SOURCES OF FUNDING BUT I

01:26:44.766 --> 01:26:49.137 region:rollup2
THINK THOSE ARE TWO BIG ONES.

01:26:46.968 --> 01:26:50.739 region:rollup2
HOW DO THEY COME TOGETHER?

01:26:49.137 --> 01:26:51.673 region:rollup2
AND SAID SAYING WELL MEDI CAL

01:26:50.739 --> 01:26:54.042 region:rollup2
MONEY HAD DOES THIS AND AND I

01:26:51.673 --> 01:26:54.810 region:rollup2
SYSTEM IS GONNA DO THAT BECAUSE

01:26:54.042 --> 01:26:57.245 region:rollup2
BASICALLY.

01:26:54.810 --> 01:26:57.813 region:rollup2
WE HAVE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS

01:26:57.245 --> 01:26:59.681 region:rollup2
THAT RUN ACROSS COUNT HOW.

01:26:57.813 --> 01:27:01.450 region:rollup2
HOW HOW DO WE GET?

01:26:59.681 --> 01:27:04.252 region:rollup2
HOW DO

01:27:01.450 --> 01:27:05.420 region:rollup2
WE GET A UNIFIED THEIR

01:27:04.252 --> 01:27:06.822 region:rollup2
COLLECTIVE YOU KNOW?

01:27:05.420 --> 01:27:08.523 region:rollup2
SALAS YOUR HOW A MENTAL HEALTH

01:27:06.822 --> 01:27:09.191 region:rollup2
GOALS COUNTIES AND HOW THEN IS

01:27:08.523 --> 01:27:11.193 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:27:09.191 --> 01:27:13.495 region:rollup2
RELATE TO THE CHEATING STATE

01:27:11.193 --> 01:27:14.763 region:rollup2
MENTAL HEALTH GOALS SO HE SPEAK

01:27:13.495 --> 01:27:16.164 region:rollup2
TO HOW EACH COUNTY LOOKS AT AND

01:27:14.763 --> 01:27:17.265 region:rollup2
IT'S A SAY IN THE MATTER CAL AND

01:27:16.164 --> 01:27:20.268 region:rollup2
HOW DO THEY TRY TO PUT THEM

01:27:17.265 --> 01:27:22.037 region:rollup2
TOGETHER ARE NOT TO OR ANYTHING

01:27:20.268 --> 01:27:22.938 region:rollup2
CITY TO GO ABOUT WATER MENTAL

01:27:22.037 --> 01:27:24.739 region:rollup2
HEALTH GOALS ARE.

01:27:22.938 --> 01:27:26.508 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE TO DRUM FOUGHT MY ONE

01:27:24.739 --> 01:27:29.478 region:rollup2
FRANKLY DOESN'T HAVE.

01:27:26.508 --> 01:27:30.045 region:rollup2
AS MUCH YOU KNOW I LEASE OF AND

01:27:29.478 --> 01:27:32.347 region:rollup2
IT'S A SAD DRIVE BECAUSE WAS

01:27:30.045 --> 01:27:33.415 region:rollup2
INITIATIVE THERE SOMEBODY YOU

01:27:32.347 --> 01:27:36.284 region:rollup2
HAVE TO GO CHECK IN WITH.

01:27:33.415 --> 01:27:36.852 region:rollup2
AND WE HAVE FACT INSURE DHS

01:27:36.284 --> 01:27:37.285 region:rollup2
WILL BE UP YOUR LITTLE LATER

01:27:36.852 --> 01:27:38.887 region:rollup2
BUT.

01:27:37.285 --> 01:27:39.621 region:rollup2
ON THE MEDI CAL SIDE I THINK

01:27:38.887 --> 01:27:41.289 region:rollup2
THERE'S BEEN SOME CONCERN

01:27:39.621 --> 01:27:42.290 region:rollup2
THERE'S VERY LITTLE BASICALLY

01:27:41.289 --> 01:27:43.825 region:rollup2
STATE DOLES OUT THE MONEY AND WE

01:27:42.290 --> 01:27:45.761 region:rollup2
DON'T HEAR MUCH ABOUT HOW

01:27:43.825 --> 01:27:46.728 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVELY IT'S BEING USED.

01:27:45.761 --> 01:27:48.130 region:rollup2
AND BACK EVEN CMS HAS POINTED

01:27:46.728 --> 01:27:49.231 region:rollup2
THAT OUT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

01:27:48.130 --> 01:27:51.032 region:rollup2
WHICH IS A PARTNER IN THE

01:27:49.231 --> 01:27:52.968 region:rollup2
MEDICAL SIDE HAS. HAS ACCURATE

01:27:51.032 --> 01:27:54.536 region:rollup2
CRITICIZED ON CALIFORNIA FOR NOT

01:27:52.968 --> 01:27:56.505 region:rollup2
DOING ENOUGH OVERSIGHT OVER DOES

01:27:54.536 --> 01:27:58.473 region:rollup2
FUNDS AND YET THAT'S A. NORMAL

01:27:56.505 --> 01:27:59.040 region:rollup2
STRUCK A MONEY AS WELL SO HOW

01:27:58.473 --> 01:28:00.775 region:rollup2
HOW WE PUT ALL THOSE PIECES

01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:02.077 region:rollup2
TOGETHER.

01:28:00.775 --> 01:28:03.345 region:rollup2
WELL ONE OF THE THINGS I GOT A

01:28:02.077 --> 01:28:05.113 region:rollup2
COUPLE COMMENTS COME TO MIND ONE

01:28:03.345 --> 01:28:06.214 region:rollup2
IS INTERNALLY YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY

01:28:05.113 --> 01:28:07.949 region:rollup2
RIGHT WE HAD A STRUCTURE IN

01:28:06.214 --> 01:28:09.151 region:rollup2
TOTAL OUR NEW DIRECTOR STARTED

01:28:07.949 --> 01:28:11.052 region:rollup2
ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF AGO THAT

01:28:09.151 --> 01:28:12.721 region:rollup2
WAS REALLY DRIVEN BY. FUNDING

01:28:11.052 --> 01:28:15.056 region:rollup2
STREAMS MORE THAN DRIVEN BY

01:28:12.721 --> 01:28:16.725 region:rollup2
ALLOCATION OF OUR SERVICES AND

01:28:15.056 --> 01:28:18.426 region:rollup2
HOW WE ARE PROMOTING HEALTH

01:28:16.725 --> 01:28:20.195 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE COUNTY SO WE HAVE IN

01:28:18.426 --> 01:28:21.596 region:rollup2
THE LAST FEW MONTHS ACTUALLY

01:28:20.195 --> 01:28:23.165 region:rollup2
TOTALLY REDONE THAT SO IT'S NO

01:28:21.596 --> 01:28:24.533 region:rollup2
LONGER DRIVEN BY FUNDING STREAMS

01:28:23.165 --> 01:28:26.334 region:rollup2
IS DRIVEN BY. PROGRAMS AND

01:28:24.533 --> 01:28:28.470 region:rollup2
OUTCOMES AND DATA AND NOT

01:28:26.334 --> 01:28:29.304 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT IT IN DIFFERENT POTS

01:28:28.470 --> 01:28:30.472 region:rollup2
WE ALSO OF COURSE PART OF THE

01:28:29.304 --> 01:28:32.274 region:rollup2
MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT AS

01:28:30.472 --> 01:28:32.807 region:rollup2
WE'VE ALL TALKED ABOUT REQUIRES

01:28:32.274 --> 01:28:34.309 region:rollup2
A LOT OF THAT STAKEHOLDER

01:28:32.807 --> 01:28:35.343 region:rollup2
ENGAGEMENT. SO WE HAD TO

01:28:34.309 --> 01:28:37.179 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDER GROUP THAT WAS

01:28:35.343 --> 01:28:38.713 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT IMAGES A DOLLARS AND

01:28:37.179 --> 01:28:40.048 region:rollup2
THEY WERE ASKING US WHY REALLY

01:28:38.713 --> 01:28:41.449 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT IMAGES A DOLLARS THAT

01:28:40.048 --> 01:28:43.084 region:rollup2
DOES MAKE SENSE WE SHOULD BE

01:28:41.449 --> 01:28:44.019 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT THE ENTIRE SYSTEM.

01:28:43.084 --> 01:28:45.554 region:rollup2
RIGHT AND SO WE AND THAT

01:28:44.019 --> 01:28:47.088 region:rollup2
APPARENTLY PEOPLE TELL ME WHAT

01:28:45.554 --> 01:28:48.690 region:rollup2
BEFORE THIS PAST THERE WAS SUCH

01:28:47.088 --> 01:28:49.524 region:rollup2
A GROUP SO NOW WE'RE LOOKING AT

01:28:48.690 --> 01:28:50.859 region:rollup2
IT THAT WAY IS WHAT WE'RE

01:28:49.524 --> 01:28:52.527 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT HOLISTICALLY BECAUSE

01:28:50.859 --> 01:28:53.562 region:rollup2
I SAID IN MY COMMENTS. PEOPLE

01:28:52.527 --> 01:28:55.330 region:rollup2
SHOULDN'T BE THINKING ABOUT

01:28:53.562 --> 01:28:56.565 region:rollup2
THOSE FUNDING STREAMS WE NEED TO

01:28:55.330 --> 01:28:58.200 region:rollup2
OF COURSE IN TERMS OF THE RULES

01:28:56.565 --> 01:29:00.836 region:rollup2
AND REGULATIONS AROUND THEM BUT

01:28:58.200 --> 01:29:01.403 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT THE WAY THAT SHOULD

01:29:00.836 --> 01:29:02.470 region:rollup2
NOT BE DRIVING THE SYSTEM.

01:29:01.403 --> 01:29:03.772 region:rollup2
SO AT LEAST INTERNALLY AS WELL

01:29:02.470 --> 01:29:04.406 region:rollup2
AS THOR STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT

01:29:03.772 --> 01:29:06.208 region:rollup2
WE'RE TRYING TO DO THAT A VERY

01:29:04.406 --> 01:29:07.475 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT WAY. AND HE SAID YOU

01:29:06.208 --> 01:29:08.610 region:rollup2
START DOING THAT HOW LONG AGO

01:29:07.475 --> 01:29:09.611 region:rollup2
WELLS ARE DIRECTOR STARTED A

01:29:08.610 --> 01:29:11.146 region:rollup2
YEAR AND A HALF AGO WHEN I

01:29:09.611 --> 01:29:12.314 region:rollup2
STARTED EIGHT MONTHS AGO WE

01:29:11.146 --> 01:29:13.582 region:rollup2
LOOKED AT THE WAY THE SYSTEM WAS

01:29:12.314 --> 01:29:14.850 region:rollup2
I MEAN MY FIRST DAY I TRIED TO

01:29:13.582 --> 01:29:16.885 region:rollup2
GET AN ORG CHART IS LIKE NO NO

01:29:14.850 --> 01:29:18.253 region:rollup2
NO. IT'S CHANGING SO AGAIN I

01:29:16.885 --> 01:29:19.354 region:rollup2
MEAN WE CAN ONLY SPEAK TO WHAT

01:29:18.253 --> 01:29:20.889 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW DOCTOR SHARON AND I

01:29:19.354 --> 01:29:21.890 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN DOING SINCE WE CAME ON

01:29:20.889 --> 01:29:23.325 region:rollup2
BUT WE'RE LOOKING AT DOING IT

01:29:21.890 --> 01:29:25.093 region:rollup2
VERY DIFFERENTLY. AND AGAIN

01:29:23.325 --> 01:29:26.728 region:rollup2
WE'RE GETTING A LOT OF OF INPUT

01:29:25.093 --> 01:29:28.396 region:rollup2
FROM AROUND THE COUNTY FOR AS

01:29:26.728 --> 01:29:31.132 region:rollup2
INCLUDING FROM OTHER DEPARTMENTS

01:29:28.396 --> 01:29:31.733 region:rollup2
AND ARE CEO'S OFFICE THAT ARE

01:29:31.132 --> 01:29:32.267 region:rollup2
REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THIS NEW

01:29:31.733 --> 01:29:33.702 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE.

01:29:32.267 --> 01:29:35.070 region:rollup2
AND CERTAINLY STAKEHOLDERS SO

01:29:33.702 --> 01:29:35.670 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW AGAIN WE WERE NOT DONE

01:29:35.070 --> 01:29:37.005 region:rollup2
BUT WE'RE DEFINITELY ALONG THE

01:29:35.670 --> 01:29:37.839 region:rollup2
WAY.

01:29:37.005 --> 01:29:39.941 region:rollup2
AND I GUESS THE OTHER QUESTION

01:29:37.839 --> 01:29:42.911 region:rollup2
AND GET FOR IT IS LIKE HOW MANY

01:29:39.941 --> 01:29:45.513 region:rollup2
OTHER COUNTIES DO IT THAT WAY.

01:29:42.911 --> 01:29:48.617 region:rollup2
THAT YOU CAN.

01:29:45.513 --> 01:29:50.218 region:rollup2
OF WHAT YOU'VE DESCRIBED IS AS A

01:29:48.617 --> 01:29:51.953 region:rollup2
MY MY LIFE EVERY DAY HAVE. IS

01:29:50.218 --> 01:29:53.488 region:rollup2
HAVE BALANCING THE FUNDING

01:29:51.953 --> 01:29:54.823 region:rollup2
STREAMS WITH THE PROGRAM NEEDS

01:29:53.488 --> 01:29:56.157 region:rollup2
OF OUR COMMUNITY.

01:29:54.823 --> 01:29:57.792 region:rollup2
AND THE WAY THAT THE CURRENT

01:29:56.157 --> 01:29:58.560 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE IS THE CURRENT FUNDING

01:29:57.792 --> 01:30:01.263 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE.

01:29:58.560 --> 01:30:03.665 region:rollup2
DOES APPEAR TO BE VERY

01:30:01.263 --> 01:30:06.268 region:rollup2
SEDUCTIVELY ENTICING COUNTIES TO

01:30:03.665 --> 01:30:08.270 region:rollup2
GO BY FUNDS DRIVEN VERSUS.

01:30:06.268 --> 01:30:09.704 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDER DRIVEN.

01:30:08.270 --> 01:30:11.139 region:rollup2
BECAUSE BECAUSE OF THE

01:30:09.704 --> 01:30:12.941 region:rollup2
COMPLEXITIES AROUND THE FUNDING

01:30:11.139 --> 01:30:14.276 region:rollup2
AND THE AND THE INDIVIDUAL NEEDS

01:30:12.941 --> 01:30:17.012 region:rollup2
OF EACH COUNTY THAT'S A VERY

01:30:14.276 --> 01:30:17.479 region:rollup2
STRONG. ARGUMENT FOR KEEPING THE

01:30:17.012 --> 01:30:20.448 region:rollup2
MHSAA FUNDING LOCALLY

01:30:17.479 --> 01:30:22.918 region:rollup2
CONTROLLED.

01:30:20.448 --> 01:30:24.085 region:rollup2
BECAUSE ONE OF THE A COUPLE OF

01:30:22.918 --> 01:30:25.387 region:rollup2
THE MAIN POTS OF MONEY OF THEM

01:30:24.085 --> 01:30:26.821 region:rollup2
SURE YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT THE

01:30:25.387 --> 01:30:27.789 region:rollup2
NINETEEN NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT

01:30:26.821 --> 01:30:29.190 region:rollup2
DOLLARS TO TWENTY ELEVEN

01:30:27.789 --> 01:30:30.258 region:rollup2
REALIGNMENT DOLLARS.

01:30:29.190 --> 01:30:32.894 region:rollup2
IF YOU'VE EVER LOOKED AT THOSE

01:30:30.258 --> 01:30:34.129 region:rollup2
REALIGNMENT FORMULAS THEY ARE

01:30:32.894 --> 01:30:35.964 region:rollup2
DEFINITELY SOMETHING TO PAY

01:30:34.129 --> 01:30:37.766 region:rollup2
ATTENTION TO.

01:30:35.964 --> 01:30:39.234 region:rollup2
IN OUR COUNTY WE HAVE THE

01:30:37.766 --> 01:30:40.635 region:rollup2
FOURTH LARGEST POPULATION THE

01:30:39.234 --> 01:30:43.738 region:rollup2
STATE. AND.

01:30:40.635 --> 01:30:44.839 region:rollup2
I THINK WE GET MAYBE FIFTY

01:30:43.738 --> 01:30:46.441 region:rollup2
SEVEN OUT OF FIFTY NINE EIGHT AT

01:30:44.839 --> 01:30:47.409 region:rollup2
THAT YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF OUR

01:30:46.441 --> 01:30:49.044 region:rollup2
REALIGNMENT DOLLARS.

01:30:47.409 --> 01:30:50.712 region:rollup2
SO WE HAVE TO BALANCE OUR MEDI

01:30:49.044 --> 01:30:52.247 region:rollup2
CAL REALIGNMENT DOLLARS WITH

01:30:50.712 --> 01:30:54.015 region:rollup2
THIRTY PST TEA WITH OUR MISSILE

01:30:52.247 --> 01:30:55.850 region:rollup2
DOLLARS. AND STILL PROVIDE THE

01:30:54.015 --> 01:30:57.352 region:rollup2
BEST SERVICE THAT WE CAN TO OUR

01:30:55.850 --> 01:30:59.054 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES SO IT'S A VERY

01:30:57.352 --> 01:31:00.155 region:rollup2
COMPLICATED SITUATION.

01:30:59.054 --> 01:31:01.790 region:rollup2
ARE COUNTIES UNDER HIRING

01:31:00.155 --> 01:31:02.791 region:rollup2
FREEZE RIGHT NOW WE'RE TALKING

01:31:01.790 --> 01:31:04.759 region:rollup2
ABOUT STRUCTURAL DEFICITS

01:31:02.791 --> 01:31:05.360 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OFFERS ALL THE THINGS

01:31:04.759 --> 01:31:05.894 region:rollup2
COME INTO PLAY WITH A FUNDING

01:31:05.360 --> 01:31:09.564 region:rollup2
STREAMS.

01:31:05.894 --> 01:31:10.899 region:rollup2
SO IT'S COMPLEX.

01:31:09.564 --> 01:31:11.800 region:rollup2
I I KNOW IT'S COMPLICATED BUT

01:31:10.899 --> 01:31:13.034 region:rollup2

01:31:11.800 --> 01:31:14.669 region:rollup2
ALL I HEAR LA COUNTY IS DOING

01:31:13.034 --> 01:31:16.504 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:31:14.669 --> 01:31:18.540 region:rollup2
WHAT YEAH WHAT WE DO TO MAKE IT

01:31:16.504 --> 01:31:19.374 region:rollup2
WORK WHAT WE'VE HAD TO?

01:31:18.540 --> 01:31:19.841 region:rollup2
PAUL THESE THINGS TOGETHER RATE

01:31:19.374 --> 01:31:23.144 region:rollup2
OF

01:31:19.841 --> 01:31:24.879 region:rollup2

STAKEHOLDER INPUT I MEAN MIMI'S.

01:31:26.648 --> 01:31:29.684 region:rollup2
APPROACH IS EXACTLY WHERE WE

01:31:28.950 --> 01:31:31.119 region:rollup2
WERE ALWAYS NEEDING TO BE IS

01:31:29.684 --> 01:31:32.754 region:rollup2
WHAT DID THE STAKEHOLDERS WANT

01:31:31.119 --> 01:31:33.188 region:rollup2
AND HOW CAN WE MAKE IT HAPPEN.

01:31:32.754 --> 01:31:36.124 region:rollup2
SO.

01:31:33.188 --> 01:31:37.092 region:rollup2
ARE A REALIGNMENT DOLLARS GO

01:31:36.124 --> 01:31:38.994 region:rollup2

BEDS.

01:31:38.994 --> 01:31:42.864 region:rollup2
IT WE'VE GOT IT GOING OFF TOPIC

01:31:42.263 --> 01:31:45.266 region:rollup2
A LITTLE BIT IF YOU KNOW THE

01:31:42.864 --> 01:31:47.068 region:rollup2
CRISIS OF OF HOSPITALIZATION

01:31:45.266 --> 01:31:49.237 region:rollup2

SO WE WORK ON A CONTINUUM OF

01:31:52.307 --> 01:31:56.411 region:rollup2
CARE WHERE WE KNOW EACH FUNDING

01:31:54.876 --> 01:31:57.779 region:rollup2

DOLLARS ON THOSE OUR ENTITLEMENT

01:35:54.749 --> 01:35:57.986 region:rollup2
DOLLARS WHICH MEANS THAT THERE

01:35:55.817 --> 01:35:59.187 region:rollup2
UNLIMITED SO TO THE EXTENT THAT

01:35:57.986 --> 01:36:01.422 region:rollup2
A COUNTY HAS.

01:35:59.187 --> 01:36:03.625 region:rollup2
MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES WITH

01:36:01.422 --> 01:36:05.994 region:rollup2

SERVICE AND THAT IS THE ONE

01:36:08.896 --> 01:36:12.700 region:rollup2
BENEFIT OBVIOUSLY. TO WHAT FFP

OVERALL DELIVERY SYSTEM

01:36:14.168 --> 01:36:17.639 region:rollup2
THE BEAUTY AND THE BENEFIT OF

ANY TO SAY DOLLARS AS THAT THEY

01:36:17.639 --> 01:36:22.043 region:rollup2
ARE INFINITELY MORE FLEXIBLE.

01:36:19.907 --> 01:36:23.878 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT HOW THEY WERE

01:36:22.043 --> 01:36:25.146 region:rollup2
INTENDED TO BE USED AS HOW THEY

01:36:23.878 --> 01:36:26.814 region:rollup2
ARE BEING USED.

01:36:25.146 --> 01:36:29.050 region:rollup2
FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE

01:36:26.814 --> 01:36:31.085 region:rollup2
FUNDS SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT HOW

01:36:29.050 --> 01:36:33.821 region:rollup2
MUCH MONEY MHSAA HAS.

01:36:31.085 --> 01:36:35.690 region:rollup2
BEEN COLLECTED OVER THE LAST.

01:36:33.821 --> 01:36:37.292 region:rollup2
MANY YEARS FOR THE SINCE THE

INCEPTION OF THE ATTACKS.

01:36:37.292 --> 01:36:39.861 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY.

01:36:38.126 --> 01:36:41.262 region:rollup2
AND SINCE WE'VE BEEN LOOKING

01:36:39.861 --> 01:36:42.463 region:rollup2
I'M DATING BACK TO TWO THOUSAND

01:36:41.262 --> 01:36:43.998 region:rollup2
AND FIVE YOU HAVE APPROXIMATELY

01:36:42.463 --> 01:36:45.967 region:rollup2
THIRTEEN AND A HALF BILLION

01:36:43.998 --> 01:36:48.169 region:rollup2

01:36:48.169 --> 01:36:51.205 region:rollup2
THE TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY.

01:36:50.438 --> 01:36:53.241 region:rollup2
MILLION.

01:36:51.205 --> 01:36:54.609 region:rollup2
.

01:36:53.241 --> 01:36:55.910 region:rollup2
THAT IS THE SUBJECT OF THE AUDIT

01:36:54.609 --> 01:36:57.912 region:rollup2
THAT IS SUBJECT TO REVERSION IS

01:36:55.910 --> 01:36:59.547 region:rollup2
ALL THAT REMAINS OUT OF THAT

01:36:57.912 --> 01:37:01.315 region:rollup2
OVER THIRTEEN BILLION DOLLARS

01:36:59.547 --> 01:37:02.750 region:rollup2
THAT HAS BEEN ALLOCATED AND

01:37:01.315 --> 01:37:05.586 region:rollup2
SPENT BY THE COUNTIES.

01:37:02.750 --> 01:37:06.454 region:rollup2
IF YOU DIDN'T READ THE AUDIT OR

01:37:05.586 --> 01:37:08.356 region:rollup2
YOU'RE NOT AS FAMILIAR WITH THE

01:37:06.454 --> 01:37:10.491 region:rollup2
ACT ON EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE

01:37:08.356 --> 01:37:12.026 region:rollup2
FUNDING THAT FLOWS TO COUNTIES.

01:37:10.491 --> 01:37:13.494 region:rollup2
IS DEDICATED TO COMMUNITY

01:37:12.026 --> 01:37:14.829 region:rollup2
SUPPORTS AND SERVICES SAID THESE

01:37:13.494 --> 01:37:17.131 region:rollup2
ARE FOR DIRECT SERVICES FOR

EARLY EMERGING OR.

01:37:19.233 --> 01:37:23.805 region:rollup2
SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS.

01:37:21.436 --> 01:37:26.307 region:rollup2
IT IS NOT A MEANS TESTED A

01:37:23.805 --> 01:37:27.542 region:rollup2
FUNDING SOURCE SO AGAIN IN OUR

01:37:26.307 --> 01:37:29.110 region:rollup2
WORLD FROM THE DEPARTMENT THAT

01:37:27.542 --> 01:37:30.611 region:rollup2
WE SIT AND MEDICAID AS A MEANS

01:37:29.110 --> 01:37:32.046 region:rollup2
TESTED PROGRAM MEANING YOU HAVE

01:37:30.611 --> 01:37:33.514 region:rollup2
TO BE BELOW A CERTAIN INCOME

01:37:32.046 --> 01:37:35.183 region:rollup2

FLEXIBILITY.

01:37:35.183 --> 01:37:38.519 region:rollup2
AND SOME OF THE.

01:37:36.818 --> 01:37:40.121 region:rollup2
BENEFIT OF MHSAA IS THAT IT'S

01:37:38.519 --> 01:37:41.622 region:rollup2
NOT A MEANS TESTED FUNDING

01:37:40.121 --> 01:37:43.858 region:rollup2
SOURCE AND THAT COUNTIES CAN USE

01:37:41.622 --> 01:37:44.792 region:rollup2
THOSE FUNDS FOR ANY INDIVIDUAL

01:37:43.858 --> 01:37:47.261 region:rollup2
THAT NEEDS MENTAL HEALTH

THE COUNTY'S QUITE CLOSELY TO

01:37:48.696 --> 01:37:52.467 region:rollup2
AND WHAT WE SAY BRAID FUNDING

01:37:50.498 --> 01:37:53.801 region:rollup2
TOGETHER MEANING THEY USE THAT

01:37:52.467 --> 01:37:54.802 region:rollup2
REALIGNMENT DOLLARS THEY USE

01:37:53.801 --> 01:37:56.003 region:rollup2
THEIR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH OF

01:37:54.802 --> 01:37:59.273 region:rollup2
ACCOUNT DOLLARS THEY USE

01:37:56.003 --> 01:38:01.576 region:rollup2
MEDICAID MONEY. THEY USE MHSAA

01:37:59.273 --> 01:38:03.478 region:rollup2
DOLLARS ON TO. FULLY DELIVER

01:38:01.576 --> 01:38:04.545 region:rollup2
SERVICES TO INDIVIDUALS ON AND

01:38:03.478 --> 01:38:06.080 region:rollup2
THAT WAS REALLY WHAT THE PANEL

01:38:04.545 --> 01:38:07.315 region:rollup2
WAS TRYING TO SAY IS REGARDLESS

01:38:06.080 --> 01:38:08.950 region:rollup2
OF THE FUNDS SOURCE THEY'RE

01:38:07.315 --> 01:38:11.452 region:rollup2
TRYING TO DELIVER A. ENTIRE

01:38:08.950 --> 01:38:13.421 region:rollup2
PACKAGE BOTH BENEFIT AND SERVICE

01:38:11.452 --> 01:38:13.821 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS THAT REQUIRE IT. I'M

01:38:13.421 --> 01:38:16.090 region:rollup2
WE.

01:38:13.821 --> 01:38:18.693 region:rollup2
AGREE WITH THE MAJORITY OF THE

01:38:16.090 --> 01:38:20.027 region:rollup2
AUDITS FINDINGS ON THE TWO AREAS

01:38:18.693 --> 01:38:21.896 region:rollup2
THAT WE DISAGREED ON MORE

01:38:20.027 --> 01:38:22.630 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY NOTED IN OUR RESPONSES

01:38:21.896 --> 01:38:24.532 region:rollup2
AROUND.

01:38:22.630 --> 01:38:25.833 region:rollup2
REASONABLE AND PRUDENT RESERVES

01:38:24.532 --> 01:38:28.503 region:rollup2
AS WELL AS IN THE FISCAL

01:38:25.833 --> 01:38:28.970 region:rollup2
REGULATIONS I KNOW THAT.

01:38:28.503 --> 01:38:30.405 region:rollup2
.

01:38:28.970 --> 01:38:32.106 region:rollup2
WE HAVE BEEN IN DISCUSSIONS WITH

01:38:30.405 --> 01:38:34.909 region:rollup2
THE COUNTIES OVER WHAT.

01:38:32.106 --> 01:38:38.246 region:rollup2
A PRUDENT RESERVE SHOULD BE.

01:38:34.909 --> 01:38:38.846 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT YOU WILL AND. I

01:38:38.246 --> 01:38:40.081 region:rollup2
THINK THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF

01:38:38.846 --> 01:38:42.250 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT OPINIONS AS TO WHAT

01:38:40.081 --> 01:38:43.751 region:rollup2
THAT LOOKS LIKE THE VOLATILITY

01:38:42.250 --> 01:38:45.920 region:rollup2
OF THE FUND ITSELF.

01:38:43.751 --> 01:38:47.255 region:rollup2
ANY TO SAY IS A TAX ON

01:38:45.920 --> 01:38:48.856 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS WITH INCOMES OVER A

01:38:47.255 --> 01:38:50.091 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS GIVEN THE WAY

01:38:48.856 --> 01:38:51.592 region:rollup2
THAT OUR CURRENT TAX STRUCTURE

01:38:50.091 --> 01:38:52.994 region:rollup2
IS AND HOW IT'S BASED ON CAPITAL

01:38:51.592 --> 01:38:54.462 region:rollup2
GAINS. THAT.

01:38:52.994 --> 01:38:57.365 region:rollup2
COLLECTION OF FUNDING IS QUITE

01:38:54.462 --> 01:38:59.267 region:rollup2
VOLATILE AS MOST OF THOSE STATES

01:38:57.365 --> 01:39:00.368 region:rollup2
OTHER AYE REVENUE SOURCES ARE

01:38:59.267 --> 01:39:02.069 region:rollup2
AND SO I THINK WE HAVE.

01:39:00.368 --> 01:39:04.806 region:rollup2
.

01:39:02.069 --> 01:39:06.374 region:rollup2

OF HOW THEY FUNDED. SERVICES AND

01:39:08.576 --> 01:39:11.946 region:rollup2
SO I THINK ARE.

01:39:09.911 --> 01:39:12.213 region:rollup2
INCLINATION IS TO BE A LITTLE

01:39:11.946 --> 01:39:13.681 region:rollup2
BIT MORE.

01:39:12.213 --> 01:39:15.583 region:rollup2
.

01:39:13.681 --> 01:39:17.185 region:rollup2
RISK AVERSE IN TERMS OF HOW THE

01:39:15.583 --> 01:39:19.153 region:rollup2
RESERVES ARE DEDICATED IS NOT IN

01:39:17.185 --> 01:39:20.855 region:rollup2
ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM OUR INTENT

01:39:19.153 --> 01:39:21.989 region:rollup2
TO HAVE COUNTY SITTING ON VAST

01:39:20.855 --> 01:39:24.292 region:rollup2
RESERVES WE DON'T WANT THEM TO

01:39:21.989 --> 01:39:26.027 region:rollup2
BE EXCESSIVE. BUT WE CERTAINLY

01:39:24.292 --> 01:39:27.428 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT IN TIMES OF DOWNTURN

01:39:26.027 --> 01:39:28.596 region:rollup2
ALL OF THE FUNDING STREAMS THAT

01:39:27.428 --> 01:39:29.964 region:rollup2

SIGNIFICANT DOWNTURN I'M HAVING

01:39:40.007 --> 01:39:43.110 region:rollup2
A RESERVE THAT IS A LITTLE BIT

01:39:41.642 --> 01:39:44.679 region:rollup2
MORE GENEROUS THAN NOT.

01:39:43.110 --> 01:39:45.546 region:rollup2
COULD CERTAINLY BENEFIT THE

01:39:44.679 --> 01:39:47.715 region:rollup2
CITIZENS THAT ARE.

01:39:45.546 --> 01:39:48.483 region:rollup2

01:43:48.722 --> 01:43:51.392 region:rollup2
CAN PUT THAT FRAMEWORK IN PLACE

01:43:50.191 --> 01:43:52.960 region:rollup2
IN THE TIME FRAME THAT THE

01:43:51.392 --> 01:43:54.328 region:rollup2
AUDITOR HAS RECOMMENDED BUT

01:43:52.960 --> 01:43:55.830 region:rollup2
WE'LL DO OUR BEST.

01:43:54.328 --> 01:43:57.431 region:rollup2
AND IN THE THIRD FINDING OF THE

01:43:55.830 --> 01:43:59.900 region:rollup2
AUDIT WAS THAT THE COMMISSION

01:43:57.431 --> 01:44:01.969 region:rollup2
MOVE FROM A LOCAL EVALUATION

01:43:59.900 --> 01:44:03.838 region:rollup2
STRATEGY FOR TRIAGE PROGRAMS TO

01:44:01.969 --> 01:44:05.873 region:rollup2
STATEWIDE STRATEGY. WHAT THAT

01:44:03.838 --> 01:44:07.575 region:rollup2
MEANS IS FOUR YEARS AGO WHEN THE

01:44:05.873 --> 01:44:09.143 region:rollup2
COMMISSION FIRST ISSUED FUNDING

01:44:07.575 --> 01:44:11.112 region:rollup2
FOR WHAT'S WHAT WE COLOR TRIAGE

01:44:09.143 --> 01:44:12.847 region:rollup2
PROGRAM WE REQUIRED EACH COUNTY

01:44:11.112 --> 01:44:15.049 region:rollup2
TO DESIGN AND EVALUATION INTO

01:44:12.847 --> 01:44:17.184 region:rollup2
THEIR PROPOSAL? THE INTENT WAS

01:44:15.049 --> 01:44:18.519 region:rollup2
TO ALLOW THE COUNTIES TO REALLY

01:44:17.184 --> 01:44:20.387 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND HOW THEIR PROGRAMS

01:44:18.519 --> 01:44:22.089 region:rollup2
WORKING FOR THEM. AND TO GIVE

01:44:20.387 --> 01:44:23.124 region:rollup2
THAT DETAILED NEW WANTS DAY THAT

01:44:22.089 --> 01:44:24.658 region:rollup2
WOULD HELP THEM STRENGTHENED

01:44:23.124 --> 01:44:26.460 region:rollup2
THEIR OWN PROGRAM.

01:44:24.658 --> 01:44:27.995 region:rollup2
AS THEY THOUGHT ABOUT A

01:44:26.460 --> 01:44:29.864 region:rollup2
STRATEGIES TO SUSTAIN THE

01:44:27.995 --> 01:44:30.464 region:rollup2
FUNDING ONCE THE GRANT DOLLARS

01:44:29.864 --> 01:44:32.299 region:rollup2
THAT WE PROVIDED TO THEM WERE

01:44:30.464 --> 01:44:33.968 region:rollup2
GONE.

01:44:32.299 --> 01:44:35.136 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY WHEN YOU DO THAT

01:44:33.968 --> 01:44:36.904 region:rollup2
REAL LOCAL NEW WANTS TO

01:44:35.136 --> 01:44:38.806 region:rollup2
VALUATION IT MAKES IT VERY HARD

01:44:36.904 --> 01:44:40.007 region:rollup2
TO TELL STATEWIDE STORY AND SO

01:44:38.806 --> 01:44:41.942 region:rollup2
THE COMMISSION HAS SHIFTED THE

01:44:40.007 --> 01:44:43.477 region:rollup2
STRATEGY. AND WERE MOVING TOWARD

01:44:41.942 --> 01:44:44.712 region:rollup2
THE STATE LEVEL EVALUATION TO

01:44:43.477 --> 01:44:46.113 region:rollup2
LOOK ACROSS THE COUNTY

01:44:44.712 --> 01:44:47.448 region:rollup2
INVESTMENTS WITH IT WITH THESE

01:44:46.113 --> 01:44:48.649 region:rollup2
TRIAGE DOLLARS INTO THAT THE

01:44:47.448 --> 01:44:50.217 region:rollup2
DECISION OF THE COMMISSION. MADE

01:44:48.649 --> 01:44:50.851 region:rollup2
IN NOVEMBER AND THAT'S VERY

01:44:50.217 --> 01:44:52.920 region:rollup2
ALIGNED WITH THE RECOMMENDATIONS

01:44:50.851 --> 01:44:53.954 region:rollup2
OF THE AUDITOR.

01:44:52.920 --> 01:44:55.356 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE COMMENTS THAT YOU

01:44:53.954 --> 01:44:57.725 region:rollup2
HEARD EARLIER WAS ABOUT THE

01:44:55.356 --> 01:44:58.926 region:rollup2
DELAYS IN SPENDING THE MONEY.

01:44:57.725 --> 01:45:01.195 region:rollup2
WHETHER OR NOT THE COMMISSION'S

01:44:58.926 --> 01:45:02.530 region:rollup2
PROCESS WAS WHAT PART OF THE

01:45:01.195 --> 01:45:03.664 region:rollup2
REASON WHY THEY'RE UNSPENT FUNDS

01:45:02.530 --> 01:45:05.099 region:rollup2
I THINK THE AUDITOR REPORTED

01:45:03.664 --> 01:45:06.333 region:rollup2
ABOUT SIXTY THREE PERCENT OF THE

01:45:05.099 --> 01:45:07.768 region:rollup2
END SPENT FUNDS HAS CURRENTLY

01:45:06.333 --> 01:45:09.203 region:rollup2
REPORTED BY THE DEPARTMENT IS

01:45:07.768 --> 01:45:10.905 region:rollup2
INNOVATION FUNDS. THE AUDITOR

01:45:09.203 --> 01:45:12.473 region:rollup2
ALSO FOUND THAT OUR PROCESS WAS

01:45:10.905 --> 01:45:14.074 region:rollup2
NOT LIKELY THE CAUSE FOR THAT

01:45:12.473 --> 01:45:15.676 region:rollup2
DELAY WE'VE APPROVED NINETY

01:45:14.074 --> 01:45:17.311 region:rollup2
THREEPERCENT OF THE PLANS THAT

01:45:15.676 --> 01:45:18.612 region:rollup2
COME BEFORE US. AND EIGHT OUT OF

01:45:17.311 --> 01:45:20.047 region:rollup2
TEN OF THOSE GET APPROVED WITHIN

01:45:18.612 --> 01:45:20.981 region:rollup2
ABOUT NINETY DAYS

01:45:20.047 --> 01:45:22.016 region:rollup2
AND THE REST TAKE A LITTLE MORE

01:45:20.981 --> 01:45:23.250 region:rollup2
TIMES AND HAS BECAUSE OF SOME

01:45:22.016 --> 01:45:23.751 region:rollup2
BACK AND FORTH.

01:45:23.250 --> 01:45:25.553 region:rollup2
SO.

01:45:23.751 --> 01:45:27.188 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE UNDERSTAND THE

01:45:25.553 --> 01:45:28.055 region:rollup2
COUNTIES CAN BE FRUSTRATED WHEN

01:45:27.188 --> 01:45:29.590 region:rollup2
THEY'VE GONE THROUGH THIS VERY

01:45:28.055 --> 01:45:31.025 region:rollup2
RIGOROUS PROCESS AT THE LOCAL

01:45:29.590 --> 01:45:32.626 region:rollup2
LEVEL AND THEN IT COMES TO THE

01:45:31.025 --> 01:45:34.728 region:rollup2
COMMISSION. AND THE COMMISSION

01:45:32.626 --> 01:45:36.197 region:rollup2
RAISES CONCERNS PART OF THE GOAL

01:45:34.728 --> 01:45:37.731 region:rollup2
OF ESTABLISHING THIS INNOVATION

01:45:36.197 --> 01:45:39.567 region:rollup2
INCUBATOR IS TO STRENGTHEN THE

01:45:37.731 --> 01:45:40.668 region:rollup2
PROCESS AT THE FRONT END.

01:45:39.567 --> 01:45:41.635 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN.

01:45:40.668 --> 01:45:43.637 region:rollup2
HAVE THE COMMISSION'S

01:45:41.635 --> 01:45:44.138 region:rollup2
INVOLVEMENT AFTER ALL OF THAT

01:45:43.637 --> 01:45:45.039 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT HAS BEEN MADE

01:45:44.138 --> 01:45:46.974 region:rollup2
LOCALLY.

01:45:45.039 --> 01:45:48.342 region:rollup2
TO TRY TO DO IT IN A WAY THAT

01:45:46.974 --> 01:45:49.743 region:rollup2
CONTINUES TO PRESERVE THE

01:45:48.342 --> 01:45:51.645 region:rollup2
ABILITY OF THE PROCESS TO BE

01:45:49.743 --> 01:45:54.081 region:rollup2
DRIVEN BY LOCAL PRIORITIES.

01:45:51.645 --> 01:45:55.249 region:rollup2
SO WORD WE'RE OPTIMISTIC THAT

01:45:54.081 --> 01:45:56.650 region:rollup2
THIS INVESTMENT IN THE TECHNICAL

01:45:55.249 --> 01:45:58.152 region:rollup2
ASSISTANCE IN PLANNING SUPPORT

01:45:56.650 --> 01:45:59.520 region:rollup2
STRATEGY WILL ADDRESS MANY OF

01:45:58.152 --> 01:46:01.021 region:rollup2
THE CHALLENGES.

01:45:59.520 --> 01:46:01.789 region:rollup2
THE COUNTIES ARE FACING IN TERMS

01:46:01.021 --> 01:46:03.490 region:rollup2
OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THEIR

01:46:01.789 --> 01:46:05.693 region:rollup2
PROPOSALS BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF

01:46:03.490 --> 01:46:07.027 region:rollup2
THE COMMISSION'S ABILITY.

01:46:05.693 --> 01:46:09.330 region:rollup2
SUPPORT THEM ALONG THE WAY

01:46:07.027 --> 01:46:10.531 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN TO HAVE THAT CLASS

01:46:09.330 --> 01:46:12.032 region:rollup2
AFTER THEY'VE DONE THAT A

01:46:10.531 --> 01:46:13.133 region:rollup2
CONSIDERABLE INVESTMENT IN LOCAL

01:46:12.032 --> 01:46:14.535 region:rollup2
PLANNING IN THE LOCAL

01:46:13.133 --> 01:46:16.170 region:rollup2
PRESENTATION THE APPROVAL BY THE

01:46:14.535 --> 01:46:18.172 region:rollup2
BOARD. AND THEN IT COMES BEFORE

01:46:16.170 --> 01:46:20.274 region:rollup2
A STATE BODY THAT THAT. THAT IS

01:46:18.172 --> 01:46:20.874 region:rollup2
NOT SATISFIED ACCORD OR DOES NOT

01:46:20.274 --> 01:46:22.710 region:rollup2
SUPPORT THE DIRECTION AT THE

01:46:20.874 --> 01:46:24.111 region:rollup2
HEADED AND. AGAIN WE'VE WE'VE

01:46:22.710 --> 01:46:25.679 region:rollup2
APPROVED NINETY THREE PERCENT OF

01:46:24.111 --> 01:46:27.514 region:rollup2
THE PLANS IN THAT IN THAT IN THE

01:46:25.679 --> 01:46:29.883 region:rollup2
WINDOW FROM I THINK THE END OF

01:46:27.514 --> 01:46:31.852 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIFTEEN THROUGH TO TODAY.

01:46:29.883 --> 01:46:33.554 region:rollup2
AND SO I THINK THE RECORD SHOWS

01:46:31.852 --> 01:46:34.989 region:rollup2
THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE ACTUALLY.

01:46:33.554 --> 01:46:36.523 region:rollup2
ENGAGING THE COUNTIES WE CREATED

01:46:34.989 --> 01:46:38.058 region:rollup2
A PROCESS THAT'S PRETTY PRETTY

01:46:36.523 --> 01:46:39.226 region:rollup2
EFFICIENT PRETTY PRETTY QUICK

01:46:38.058 --> 01:46:40.995 region:rollup2
AND ACTUALLY DOES FOR THE MOST

01:46:39.226 --> 01:46:42.096 region:rollup2
PART RESULT IN APPROVALS WHEN

01:46:40.995 --> 01:46:43.564 region:rollup2
THE COMMISSION DOES TURN COUNTY

01:46:42.096 --> 01:46:45.266 region:rollup2
DOWN IT IT GIVES THE RIGHT

01:46:43.564 --> 01:46:46.934 region:rollup2
EXPLAINS THE CHALLENGE FOR THE

01:46:45.266 --> 01:46:48.135 region:rollup2
OR BUT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR. AND

01:46:46.934 --> 01:46:49.703 region:rollup2
RECOMMEND THAT THEY COME BACK

01:46:48.135 --> 01:46:51.438 region:rollup2
WITH A REVISED PROPOSAL

01:46:49.703 --> 01:46:52.773 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES THAT WORKS SOMETIMES

01:46:51.438 --> 01:46:54.174 region:rollup2
IT DOESN'T.

01:46:52.773 --> 01:46:56.176 region:rollup2
LASTLY I WOULD SAY THAT.

01:46:54.174 --> 01:46:57.878 region:rollup2
.

01:46:56.176 --> 01:46:58.946 region:rollup2
WE'VE GOT A COUPLE OF THINGS WE

01:46:57.878 --> 01:47:01.148 region:rollup2
GIVE ANYONE IS A IT'S A

01:46:58.946 --> 01:47:02.750 region:rollup2
DASHBOARD WHERE WE TRACK PLANS.

01:47:01.148 --> 01:47:03.984 region:rollup2
AND SO YOU CAN SEE THE NUMBER OF

01:47:02.750 --> 01:47:06.053 region:rollup2
COUNTIES THAT ARE CURRENTLY

01:47:03.984 --> 01:47:06.654 region:rollup2
PENDING REVIEW BY THE COMMISSION

01:47:06.053 --> 01:47:08.922 region:rollup2
YOU CAN SEE THOSE ARE IN THE

01:47:06.654 --> 01:47:09.757 region:rollup2
QUEUE. YOU CAN SEE THE ONES THAT

01:47:08.922 --> 01:47:11.558 region:rollup2
ARE BEING DEVELOPED AN AMOUNT OF

01:47:09.757 --> 01:47:13.160 region:rollup2
FUNDS AND THEIR SEVEN COUNTIES

01:47:11.558 --> 01:47:14.862 region:rollup2
THAT HAVE NOT PRESENTED IN ANY

01:47:13.160 --> 01:47:15.362 region:rollup2
INNOVATION PLANS BEFORE THE

01:47:14.862 --> 01:47:16.297 region:rollup2
COMMISSION SINCE TWENTY

01:47:15.362 --> 01:47:17.631 region:rollup2
THIRTEEN.

01:47:16.297 --> 01:47:20.034 region:rollup2
SO WE THINK THERE'S OF RANGE OF

01:47:17.631 --> 01:47:23.037 region:rollup2
REASONS WHY THE FUNDS ARE BEING

01:47:20.034 --> 01:47:24.939 region:rollup2
ALLOCATED AND IT'S IT'S. THERE'S

01:47:23.037 --> 01:47:26.240 region:rollup2
A LOT THAT WE CAN DO IN TERMS OF

01:47:24.939 --> 01:47:27.775 region:rollup2
OUR OWN INTERNAL PROCESS BUT

01:47:26.240 --> 01:47:28.342 region:rollup2
THERE'S MORE WE CAN DO IN TERMS

01:47:27.775 --> 01:47:29.410 region:rollup2
OF SUPPORTING THE BILL IF

01:47:28.342 --> 01:47:31.645 region:rollup2
COUNTIES TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF

01:47:29.410 --> 01:47:33.047 region:rollup2
THESE FUNDS.

01:47:31.645 --> 01:47:35.282 region:rollup2
THE AM I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU

01:47:33.047 --> 01:47:36.784 region:rollup2
TO OTHER THINGS ONE IS THAT IT'S

01:47:35.282 --> 01:47:38.752 region:rollup2
A SCREENSHOT OF OUR FISCAL

01:47:36.784 --> 01:47:40.454 region:rollup2
TRANSPARENCY TOOL THIS IS LIVE

01:47:38.752 --> 01:47:43.190 region:rollup2
ON OUR WEBSITE TODAY. IT ALLOWS

01:47:40.454 --> 01:47:44.625 region:rollup2
THE PUBLIC AND POLICYMAKERS TO

01:47:43.190 --> 01:47:46.126 region:rollup2
CLICK ON THEIR COUNTY AND

01:47:44.625 --> 01:47:47.428 region:rollup2
IDENTIFY THE REVENUES THAT THEY

01:47:46.126 --> 01:47:48.796 region:rollup2
RECEIVE FROM AND I JUST SAY OVER

01:47:47.428 --> 01:47:50.130 region:rollup2
MULTIPLE YEARS THE FUNDS THAT

01:47:48.796 --> 01:47:51.598 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN SPENT. AND THE MONEY

01:47:50.130 --> 01:47:52.833 region:rollup2
THAT'S IN THE BANK AND THE

01:47:51.598 --> 01:47:55.002 region:rollup2
REASON FOR THAT IS BECAUSE I

01:47:52.833 --> 01:47:56.403 region:rollup2
KNOW HOW SERVICES ACT REQUIRES

01:47:55.002 --> 01:47:57.438 region:rollup2
THE COUNTIES TO GO THROUGH A

01:47:56.403 --> 01:47:58.739 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY PLANNING PROCESS.

01:47:57.438 --> 01:48:00.774 region:rollup2
AND SO WE'RE WORKING TO

01:47:58.739 --> 01:48:02.076 region:rollup2
ESTABLISH TOOLS THAT SUPPORT

01:48:00.774 --> 01:48:03.510 region:rollup2
THAT PLANNING PROCESS AND

01:48:02.076 --> 01:48:05.245 region:rollup2
THERE'S THREE COMPONENTS AND SO

01:48:03.510 --> 01:48:05.546 region:rollup2
I'M SORRY MINE IS IN COLOR IT'S

01:48:05.245 --> 01:48:07.348 region:rollup2
MUCH NICER.

01:48:05.546 --> 01:48:08.315 region:rollup2
.

01:48:07.348 --> 01:48:10.017 region:rollup2
THE FIRST COMPONENT IS FISCAL

01:48:08.315 --> 01:48:11.285 region:rollup2
TRANSPARENCY.

01:48:10.017 --> 01:48:12.419 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT IS LIVE ON OUR SITE

01:48:11.285 --> 01:48:13.821 region:rollup2
TODAY.

01:48:12.419 --> 01:48:15.522 region:rollup2
THE SECOND COMPONENT IS AROUND

01:48:13.821 --> 01:48:16.790 region:rollup2
SERVICES AND PROGRAMS

01:48:15.522 --> 01:48:17.958 region:rollup2
AND SO WE'RE WORKING TO DEVELOP

01:48:16.790 --> 01:48:19.727 region:rollup2
A TOOL WHERE YOU CAN CLICK ON

01:48:17.958 --> 01:48:20.894 region:rollup2
YOUR COUNTY AND SEE THE SERVICES

01:48:19.727 --> 01:48:22.096 region:rollup2
THAT ARE THAT ARE SUPPORTED WITH

01:48:20.894 --> 01:48:23.330 region:rollup2
THESE PUBLIC DOLLARS.

01:48:22.096 --> 01:48:24.498 region:rollup2
THE TYPES OF PROGRAMS THAT ARE

01:48:23.330 --> 01:48:25.933 region:rollup2
OFFERED INCLUDING INFORMATION ON

01:48:24.498 --> 01:48:27.334 region:rollup2
PEOPLE SERVED AND THE LAST PIECE

01:48:25.933 --> 01:48:29.303 region:rollup2
IS THE OUTCOMES

01:48:27.334 --> 01:48:30.404 region:rollup2
AND FOR OUTCOMES WERE BUILDING

01:48:29.303 --> 01:48:32.039 region:rollup2
OFF OF THE LANGUAGE THAT IS IN

01:48:30.404 --> 01:48:32.873 region:rollup2
THE ACT ALREADY.

01:48:32.039 --> 01:48:34.174 region:rollup2
THAT INCLUDES AMONG OTHER

01:48:32.873 --> 01:48:35.743 region:rollup2
OUTCOMES THINGS LIKE REDUCING

01:48:34.174 --> 01:48:37.378 region:rollup2
CRIMINAL JUSTICE INVOLVEMENT

01:48:35.743 --> 01:48:39.713 region:rollup2
SO WE HAVE A PRELIMINARY DATA

01:48:37.378 --> 01:48:40.881 region:rollup2
MATCH BETWEEN FSP DATA BETWEEN.

01:48:39.713 --> 01:48:42.316 region:rollup2
OF PEOPLE HER SIR BY FULL

01:48:40.881 --> 01:48:44.184 region:rollup2
SERVICE PARTNERSHIP PROGRAMS

01:48:42.316 --> 01:48:45.552 region:rollup2
HIGHEST AND HIGHEST LEVEL OF

01:48:44.184 --> 01:48:46.987 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY BASED CARE. AND WE'RE

01:48:45.552 --> 01:48:48.489 region:rollup2
LINKING THAT TO DATA FROM THE

WE DO A BILL.

01:53:26.300 --> 01:53:29.536 region:rollup2
AND SO NOW WE HAVE THE ON IT

01:53:26.867 --> 01:53:31.204 region:rollup2
NOW.

01:53:29.536 --> 01:53:32.973 region:rollup2
THIS IS WHERE WHERE WE ARE RIGHT

01:53:31.204 --> 01:53:35.175 region:rollup2
NOW WE'RE AT THE POINT WHERE WE.

01:53:32.973 --> 01:53:37.177 region:rollup2
LOOK INTO IT WE HAVE THIS AUDIT.

01:53:35.175 --> 01:53:39.346 region:rollup2

THERE IS SOME.

01:53:39.346 --> 01:53:42.416 region:rollup2
EFFICIENCIES THAT WE HAVE TO

01:53:39.913 --> 01:53:46.253 region:rollup2

01:53:42.416 --> 01:53:47.788 region:rollup2
WITH THIS EXPENDITURE MONEY.

01:53:46.253 --> 01:53:48.455 region:rollup2
WE HAD THE RIVERS AND THREE YEAR

01:53:47.788 --> 01:53:50.791 region:rollup2
ROLL AND IT'S NOT BEEN

01:53:48.455 --> 01:53:54.428 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTED.

01:53:50.791 --> 01:53:56.129 region:rollup2
IT'S.

01:53:54.428 --> 01:53:58.865 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO ESTABLISH ALTHOUGH

01:53:56.129 --> 01:54:00.734 region:rollup2
THE STRUCTURE SO WE CAN DO THAT.

01:53:58.865 --> 01:54:02.469 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S WHO WE NEED TO DO AND

01:54:00.734 --> 01:54:03.837 region:rollup2
I THINK WERE RINGING NOW.

01:54:02.469 --> 01:54:05.739 region:rollup2
THAT THAT'S GOING TO BE DONE.

01:54:03.837 --> 01:54:07.541 region:rollup2
AND I WANT TO CORRECT.

01:54:05.739 --> 01:54:09.710 region:rollup2
ANYBODY THAT THINKS OTHERWISE WE

01:54:07.541 --> 01:54:11.244 region:rollup2
ARE CORRECTING THAT PROBLEM.

01:54:09.710 --> 01:54:17.050 region:rollup2
IS THAT NOT TRUE.

01:54:11.244 --> 01:54:20.120 region:rollup2
FOR THE PANELISTS.

01:54:17.050 --> 01:54:20.754 region:rollup2
NOBODY'S SAYING ANYTHING.

01:54:20.120 --> 01:54:21.855 region:rollup2
FOR THE RECORD WHERE CORRECTING

01:54:20.754 --> 01:54:22.789 region:rollup2

01:54:21.855 --> 01:54:24.458 region:rollup2
OKAY WE GOT THAT PROBLEM

01:54:22.789 --> 01:54:25.826 region:rollup2
CORRECTED.

01:54:24.458 --> 01:54:27.294 region:rollup2
SO I'M GLAD THAT WE'RE GETTING

01:54:25.826 --> 01:54:29.529 region:rollup2

01:54:27.294 --> 01:54:32.365 region:rollup2
WHEN I STARTED THAT PROCESS.

01:54:29.529 --> 01:54:32.999 region:rollup2
WELL LAST YEAR IT WAS LIKE WELL

01:54:32.365 --> 01:54:34.468 region:rollup2
WE DON'T WANT YOU KNOW WHEN NO

01:54:32.999 --> 01:54:36.169 region:rollup2
ONE IF WE DON'T WANT TO GET INTO

01:54:34.468 --> 01:54:37.070 region:rollup2
THIS JIM WE DON'T WANNA WE DON'T

01:54:36.169 --> 01:54:40.040 region:rollup2
WANNA.

01:54:37.070 --> 01:54:42.075 region:rollup2
GET A THIS IS A MESSY THINK SO

01:54:40.040 --> 01:54:43.710 region:rollup2
WE HAVE WE HAVE NOW A UNANSWERED

01:54:42.075 --> 01:54:45.145 region:rollup2
HERE WITH THIS AUDIT. THAT WE'RE

01:54:43.710 --> 01:54:46.980 region:rollup2
GOING TO CORRECT IT.

01:54:45.145 --> 01:54:48.682 region:rollup2
THEN THERE'S THAT THEN THERE'S

01:54:46.980 --> 01:54:52.085 region:rollup2
THE PROCEDURES AND THE.

01:54:48.682 --> 01:54:53.954 region:rollup2
THE THE PROCESS FOR MAKING SURE.

01:54:52.085 --> 01:54:54.254 region:rollup2
LIKE I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT WHEN

01:54:53.954 --> 01:54:56.823 region:rollup2
I HAD THAT.

01:54:54.254 --> 01:54:58.525 region:rollup2
.

01:54:56.823 --> 01:55:00.794 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION DURING THE CAMPAIGN

01:54:58.525 --> 01:55:02.295 region:rollup2
FOR PROP SIXTY THREE THAT THE

01:55:00.794 --> 01:55:04.431 region:rollup2
MONEY WAS GOING TO BE SPENT.

01:55:02.295 --> 01:55:07.334 region:rollup2
TIMELY.

01:55:04.431 --> 01:55:08.602 region:rollup2
AND WE HAVE A SENSE OF URGENCY.

01:55:07.334 --> 01:55:12.405 region:rollup2
ON THIS MONEY BECAUSE QUITE

01:55:08.602 --> 01:55:14.374 region:rollup2
FRANKLY.

01:55:12.405 --> 01:55:16.376 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT WE DON'T.

01:55:14.374 --> 01:55:17.844 region:rollup2
WE DON'T HAVE YOU KNOW.

01:55:16.376 --> 01:55:19.179 region:rollup2
WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE PUBLIC

01:55:17.844 --> 01:55:22.015 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY GETS OF THE ADEQUATE

01:55:19.179 --> 01:55:23.016 region:rollup2
MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES?

01:55:22.015 --> 01:55:25.218 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY I SOMEONE STATES A

01:55:23.016 --> 01:55:28.021 region:rollup2
TWELVE PERCENT.

01:55:25.218 --> 01:55:29.756 region:rollup2
IT'S IS IS CREDIBLY LOW NUMBER.

01:55:28.021 --> 01:55:31.792 region:rollup2
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

01:55:29.756 --> 01:55:33.160 region:rollup2
RIDICULOUSLY LOW.

01:55:31.792 --> 01:55:35.061 region:rollup2
THAT THE ADEQUATE OF THE MENTAL

01:55:33.160 --> 01:55:36.596 region:rollup2
HEALTH SYSTEM.

01:55:35.061 --> 01:55:39.065 region:rollup2
AND SO LIKE NOT SPENDING MONEY

01:55:36.596 --> 01:55:39.699 region:rollup2
ON THAT.

01:55:39.065 --> 01:55:42.335 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:55:39.699 --> 01:55:44.938 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR AREA.

01:55:42.335 --> 01:55:47.207 region:rollup2
AND HAVING ITS RESERVES.

01:55:44.938 --> 01:55:49.176 region:rollup2
IS TO ME KIND OF A MISTER

01:55:47.207 --> 01:55:51.244 region:rollup2
CHAIRMAN PRIVATE PROBLEM.

01:55:49.176 --> 01:55:52.979 region:rollup2
THEY'RE HAVING THIS RESERVES.

01:55:51.244 --> 01:55:54.448 region:rollup2
AND A AND AND IT'S KINDA LIKE

01:55:52.979 --> 01:55:56.416 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT SPEND THE MONEY BUT WE

01:55:54.448 --> 01:55:59.719 region:rollup2
HAVE THIS URGENCY OKAY. SO I I

01:55:56.416 --> 01:56:02.389 region:rollup2
WOULD LIKE TO SEE A ROBUST.

01:55:59.719 --> 01:56:03.957 region:rollup2
MAYBE DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT THE

01:56:02.389 --> 01:56:05.158 region:rollup2
RESERVE SHOULD BE WHAT.

01:56:03.957 --> 01:56:05.725 region:rollup2
LEVEL THAT. SHOULD BE THERE'S A

01:56:05.158 --> 01:56:07.727 region:rollup2
DIS.

01:56:05.725 --> 01:56:10.497 region:rollup2
THINK.

01:56:07.727 --> 01:56:12.199 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCE OF OPINION ABOUT US.

01:56:10.497 --> 01:56:12.799 region:rollup2
NOW THE FIRST QUESTION WOULD BE

01:56:12.199 --> 01:56:14.267 region:rollup2
WHAT SHOULD THE RESERVE LEVEL

01:56:12.799 --> 01:56:16.203 region:rollup2
BE.

01:56:14.267 --> 01:56:18.872 region:rollup2
AND DO WE HAVE.

01:56:16.203 --> 01:56:21.274 region:rollup2
NORMALLY.

01:56:18.872 --> 01:56:23.543 region:rollup2
A RESERVE FOR.

01:56:21.274 --> 01:56:24.778 region:rollup2
OF FUND.

01:56:23.543 --> 01:56:27.514 region:rollup2
OR SHOULD WE NOT ESTABLISH

01:56:24.778 --> 01:56:29.616 region:rollup2
RESERVES.

01:56:27.514 --> 01:56:31.184 region:rollup2
FOR A COUNTY SHOULD THE COUNTY

01:56:29.616 --> 01:56:32.686 region:rollup2
NOT DETERMINE WHAT THE RESERVE

01:56:31.184 --> 01:56:34.988 region:rollup2
IS FOR THE MENTAL HEALTH.

01:56:32.686 --> 01:56:36.656 region:rollup2
PROGRAM.

01:56:34.988 --> 01:56:38.658 region:rollup2
SO IT USUALLY IS THAT YOU

01:56:36.656 --> 01:56:40.060 region:rollup2
ESTABLISH A RESERVE FOR.

01:56:38.658 --> 01:56:41.962 region:rollup2
THE PROGRAM IF IT'S AN ONGOING

01:56:40.060 --> 01:56:43.497 region:rollup2
PROGRAM.

01:56:41.962 --> 01:56:44.064 region:rollup2
AND THAT WOULD INCLUDE MONEY

01:56:43.497 --> 01:56:46.299 region:rollup2
FROM ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT

01:56:44.064 --> 01:56:47.968 region:rollup2
PLACES.

01:56:46.299 --> 01:56:50.804 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN JUST RESERVES FOR

01:56:47.968 --> 01:56:53.206 region:rollup2
THE OF PARTICULAR FUNDS SO.

01:56:50.804 --> 01:56:55.075 region:rollup2
WHAT WOULD THE OPINION OF PEOPLE

01:56:53.206 --> 01:56:57.344 region:rollup2
HERE THIS PANEL BE ABOUT WHAT

01:56:55.075 --> 01:56:58.745 region:rollup2
LEVEL RESERVE SHOULD WE HAVE?

01:56:57.344 --> 01:57:00.881 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S A DIFFERENCE WITH

01:56:58.745 --> 01:57:02.616 region:rollup2
THE AUDITOR CORRECT.

01:57:00.881 --> 01:57:03.149 region:rollup2
SO WE NEED OF GET THAT CLEARED

01:57:02.616 --> 01:57:04.885 region:rollup2
UP SO I'D LIKE TO ASK THAT

01:57:03.149 --> 01:57:05.519 region:rollup2
QUESTION.

01:57:04.885 --> 01:57:09.689 region:rollup2
WHAT RESERVE SHOULD WE HAVE FOR

01:57:05.519 --> 01:57:12.058 region:rollup2
THESE?

01:57:09.689 --> 01:57:14.327 region:rollup2
SO AND I THINK SENATOR THAT IS.

01:57:12.058 --> 01:57:16.062 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE KEY CRITICAL.

01:57:14.327 --> 01:57:17.597 region:rollup2
ITEMS THAT WERE WORKING THROUGH

01:57:16.062 --> 01:57:18.899 region:rollup2
AS BOTH THE CONSEQUENCE OF THE

01:57:17.597 --> 01:57:21.568 region:rollup2
AUDIT AS WELL AS.

01:57:18.899 --> 01:57:23.537 region:rollup2
WE TRY TO WORK IN CLOSE

01:57:21.568 --> 01:57:25.171 region:rollup2
PARTNERSHIP WITH BOTH THE LA SEE

01:57:23.537 --> 01:57:27.474 region:rollup2
AS WELL AS THE COUNTIES.

01:57:25.171 --> 01:57:29.276 region:rollup2
SO WE HAVE AND WE HAD RETAINED

01:57:27.474 --> 01:57:31.044 region:rollup2
OUTSIDE.

01:57:29.276 --> 01:57:32.946 region:rollup2
EXPERTISE TO HELP US DETERMINE

01:57:31.044 --> 01:57:34.347 region:rollup2
THE LEVEL THAT WE HAD COME UP

01:57:32.946 --> 01:57:36.049 region:rollup2
WITH I THINK THE AUDITOR HAD A

01:57:34.347 --> 01:57:36.750 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT LEVEL I KNOW THAT THE

01:57:36.049 --> 01:57:38.552 region:rollup2
COUNTIES.

01:57:36.750 --> 01:57:40.420 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT WHAT

01:57:38.552 --> 01:57:42.022 region:rollup2
THEY WOULD PERCEIVE AS A

01:57:40.420 --> 01:57:43.323 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE. AND IF PRUDENT

01:57:42.022 --> 01:57:44.958 region:rollup2
RESERVE AND I DON'T KNOW THAT

01:57:43.323 --> 01:57:47.260 region:rollup2
ANY OF US HAVE.

01:57:44.958 --> 01:57:48.428 region:rollup2
AS OF YET SAT DOWN AND COME TO

01:57:47.260 --> 01:57:49.729 region:rollup2
A MEETING OF THE MINDS I KNOW

01:57:48.428 --> 01:57:52.866 region:rollup2
THAT WE.

01:57:49.729 --> 01:57:54.668 region:rollup2
LIKE I SAID AND.

01:57:52.866 --> 01:57:56.269 region:rollup2
GIVEN THE VOLATILITY OF BOTH THE

01:57:54.668 --> 01:57:58.505 region:rollup2
FUND AND OUR OVERALL STATE

01:57:56.269 --> 01:58:00.340 region:rollup2
ECONOMY AND NOT WANTING TO HAVE

01:57:58.505 --> 01:58:01.541 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS LOSING SERVICE AT

01:58:00.340 --> 01:58:03.610 region:rollup2
THE SAME TIME WHEN THERE'S A

01:58:01.541 --> 01:58:04.544 region:rollup2
RECESSION I THINK WE. TEND TO BE

01:58:03.610 --> 01:58:06.579 region:rollup2
MORE.

01:58:04.544 --> 01:58:08.381 region:rollup2
CONSERVATIVE IN WANTING A

01:58:06.579 --> 01:58:09.449 region:rollup2
BIGGER RESERVE BUT I THINK. I'M

01:58:08.381 --> 01:58:12.118 region:rollup2
TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN REACH

01:58:09.449 --> 01:58:13.887 region:rollup2
CONSENSUS WITH THE A COUNTIES ON

01:58:12.118 --> 01:58:15.422 region:rollup2
WHAT IS AN APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF

01:58:13.887 --> 01:58:17.057 region:rollup2
RESERVE WE WOULD PUT THAT INTO

01:58:15.422 --> 01:58:18.224 region:rollup2
THE FISCAL REGULATIONSTHAT WE

01:58:17.057 --> 01:58:19.626 region:rollup2
ARE WORKING ON AS.

01:58:18.224 --> 01:58:20.961 region:rollup2
EVIDENCE STIR.

01:58:19.626 --> 01:58:22.295 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDED IN THE AUDIT

01:58:20.961 --> 01:58:24.731 region:rollup2
SOLUTION RECOMMENDATION ON

01:58:22.295 --> 01:58:26.232 region:rollup2
RESERVE IT'S BETWEEN SIXTY THREE

01:58:24.731 --> 01:58:27.233 region:rollup2
AND EIGHTY.

01:58:26.232 --> 01:58:29.769 region:rollup2
XTC THREE AND EIGHTY FOUR

01:58:27.233 --> 01:58:31.571 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF THE ANNUAL ALLOCATION

01:58:29.769 --> 01:58:32.839 region:rollup2
THAT IT COUNTY RECEIVE SO TO

01:58:31.571 --> 01:58:34.374 region:rollup2
MAKE THE MATH EASY IF I GOT A

01:58:32.839 --> 01:58:35.842 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS WE WOULD SAY YOU

01:58:34.374 --> 01:58:37.210 region:rollup2

01:58:58.531 --> 01:59:01.534 region:rollup2
IF I COULD MET MISTER CHAIRMAN

01:58:59.132 --> 01:59:02.736 region:rollup2
SHORT QUESTION.

SO I CAN THINK OF THANK YOU

01:59:12.045 --> 01:59:13.813 region:rollup2
SENATOR FOR THE RECORD JOHN

BUYER THE STATE AUDITOR'S

01:59:13.813 --> 01:59:17.083 region:rollup2
OFFICE.

01:59:14.914 --> 01:59:18.585 region:rollup2
WE WE LOOKED AT THE FLUCTUATION

01:59:17.083 --> 01:59:20.420 region:rollup2
AND IN THE MIDDLE SERVICES

01:59:18.585 --> 01:59:21.921 region:rollup2
REVENUES FROM YEAR TO YEAR OVER

01:59:20.420 --> 01:59:23.456 region:rollup2
THE PAST TEN YEAR PERIOD. AND WE

01:59:21.921 --> 01:59:25.925 region:rollup2
LOOKED AT THAT THE LARGEST

01:59:23.456 --> 01:59:28.361 region:rollup2
DECLINE IN ANY ONE YEAR AS THAT

01:59:25.925 --> 01:59:29.996 region:rollup2
THE AS LIKELY THEM THE MOST I

01:59:28.361 --> 01:59:31.765 region:rollup2
RESERVE COULD BE. THAT LARGEST

01:59:29.996 --> 01:59:33.166 region:rollup2
DECLINE IN ANY ONE YEAR WAS

01:59:31.765 --> 01:59:35.602 region:rollup2
THIRTY THREE PERCENT.

01:59:33.166 --> 01:59:36.770 region:rollup2
THE IN THE END THE AVERAGE OF

01:59:35.602 --> 01:59:38.138 region:rollup2
THOSE DECLINES OVER THAT TEN

01:59:36.770 --> 01:59:39.506 region:rollup2
YEAR PERIOD UP OF THE CLIENTS

01:59:38.138 --> 01:59:41.641 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES.

01:59:39.506 --> 01:59:43.443 region:rollup2
WAS TWENTY THREE PERCENT SWEET

01:59:41.641 --> 01:59:44.844 region:rollup2
WE PAID A RANGE BETWEEN TWENTY

01:59:43.443 --> 01:59:46.112 region:rollup2
THREE. PERCENT AND THIRTY THREE

01:59:44.844 --> 01:59:49.449 region:rollup2
PERCENT.

01:59:46.112 --> 01:59:51.117 region:rollup2
OKAY SO.

01:59:49.449 --> 01:59:52.886 region:rollup2
SO YOU HAD A MILLION DOLLARS HOW

01:59:51.117 --> 01:59:54.654 region:rollup2
MUCH WOULD THAT BE COMPLETELY

01:59:52.886 --> 01:59:57.424 region:rollup2
DEALER TO WHAT A TWO. TWO

01:59:54.654 --> 01:59:59.426 region:rollup2
HUNDRED THIRTY THREE THOUSAND OR

01:59:57.424 --> 02:00:00.026 region:rollup2
THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND.

01:59:59.426 --> 02:00:02.295 region:rollup2
DELEGATES THAT'S WHAT YOU CAN

02:00:00.026 --> 02:00:04.264 region:rollup2
SEE THE DIFFERENCE.

02:00:02.295 --> 02:00:05.765 region:rollup2
OKAY IT START THINK I THINK I'M

02:00:04.264 --> 02:00:07.901 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHY I THINK THAT THIS IS

02:00:05.765 --> 02:00:09.402 region:rollup2
A KEY DISCUSSION.

02:00:07.901 --> 02:00:11.004 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WHAT THE RIGHT RESERVE

02:00:09.402 --> 02:00:12.005 region:rollup2
LEVELS SHOULD BE.

02:00:11.004 --> 02:00:13.773 region:rollup2
AND WHAT I'D LIKE JUST ADD

02:00:12.005 --> 02:00:14.908 region:rollup2
SENATOR IS ONE OF THE THINGS

02:00:13.773 --> 02:00:16.176 region:rollup2
THAT WE DISCUSSED IN THE REPORT

02:00:14.908 --> 02:00:18.178 region:rollup2
THAT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AS

02:00:16.176 --> 02:00:19.345 region:rollup2
AT MONEY THAT'S PUT INTO RESERVE

02:00:18.178 --> 02:00:21.081 region:rollup2
IS NOT NECESSARILY SUBJECT TO

02:00:19.345 --> 02:00:23.016 region:rollup2
REVERSION.

02:00:21.081 --> 02:00:24.551 region:rollup2
SO TO THE EXTENT THAT. A LOCAL

02:00:23.016 --> 02:00:25.852 region:rollup2
ENTITIES ARE PUTTING MONEY INTO

02:00:24.551 --> 02:00:27.187 region:rollup2
RESERVE AND NOT SPENDING IT THAT

02:00:25.852 --> 02:00:29.456 region:rollup2
MONEY IS NOT GONNA REVERT BACK

02:00:27.187 --> 02:00:30.924 region:rollup2
TO THE STATE FOR REALLOCATION TO

02:00:29.456 --> 02:00:33.159 region:rollup2
OTHER COUNTIES. THE OTHER THING

02:00:30.924 --> 02:00:34.928 region:rollup2
WE IDENTIFIED IN THE REPORT IS

02:00:33.159 --> 02:00:35.995 region:rollup2
WHEN WE LOOK AT THE FIFTY NINE

02:00:34.928 --> 02:00:37.430 region:rollup2
ENTITIES THAT HAVE.

02:00:35.995 --> 02:00:38.631 region:rollup2
.

02:00:37.430 --> 02:00:39.866 region:rollup2
THAT ARE PARTICIPATING IS

02:00:38.631 --> 02:00:41.301 region:rollup2
PROGRAM WE WE IDENTIFIED FORTY

02:00:39.866 --> 02:00:43.269 region:rollup2
SIX.

02:00:41.301 --> 02:00:43.803 region:rollup2
THAT DID NOT HAVE FUNDS THAT

02:00:43.269 --> 02:00:45.205 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO

02:00:43.803 --> 02:00:46.673 region:rollup2
REVERSION.

02:00:45.205 --> 02:00:47.874 region:rollup2
BACK IN OF AT THE END OF TWENTY

02:00:46.673 --> 02:00:49.576 region:rollup2
SIX

02:00:47.874 --> 02:00:50.977 region:rollup2
STEAM DOT FISCAL YEAR TWENTY

02:00:49.576 --> 02:00:52.979 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN SO THERE ARE COUNTIES

02:00:50.977 --> 02:00:54.481 region:rollup2
AND ENTITIES OUT THERE. THAT ARE

02:00:52.979 --> 02:00:56.950 region:rollup2
USING THESE FUNDS COULD USE

02:00:54.481 --> 02:00:58.485 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL FUNDING SO THE REASON

02:00:56.950 --> 02:00:59.586 region:rollup2
WE THINK HAVING THE APPROPRIATE

02:00:58.485 --> 02:01:01.554 region:rollup2
RESERVE AMOUNT IS CRITICALLY

02:00:59.586 --> 02:01:02.989 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT IS. SO THERE IS AN

02:01:01.554 --> 02:01:05.024 region:rollup2
EXCESSIVE RESERVES AT CERTAIN

02:01:02.989 --> 02:01:06.593 region:rollup2
COUNTIES WERE OTHER COUNTIES

02:01:05.024 --> 02:01:08.561 region:rollup2
COULD USE THOSE FUNDS TO GET.

02:01:06.593 --> 02:01:10.864 region:rollup2
OUR MONEY OUT THERE AND PROVIDE

02:01:08.561 --> 02:01:11.397 region:rollup2
SERVICES TO OUR INDIVIDUALS IN

02:01:10.864 --> 02:01:12.565 region:rollup2
VARIOUS COMMUNITIES IN THE

02:01:11.397 --> 02:01:14.968 region:rollup2
STATE.

02:01:12.565 --> 02:01:16.503 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S WHY WE DID AN ANALYSIS

02:01:14.968 --> 02:01:18.304 region:rollup2
WE THOUGHT IT WAS FAIR LOOKING

02:01:16.503 --> 02:01:19.939 region:rollup2
AT A TEN YEAR WINDOW. ARE AND

02:01:18.304 --> 02:01:21.307 region:rollup2
SAYING WHAT WAS THE WORST CASE

02:01:19.939 --> 02:01:22.675 region:rollup2
SCENARIO OVER THOSE TEN YEARS AS

02:01:21.307 --> 02:01:23.977 region:rollup2
MR BUYER INDICATORS ABOUT THIRTY

02:01:22.675 --> 02:01:25.779 region:rollup2
THREE PERCENT.

02:01:23.977 --> 02:01:27.380 region:rollup2
SO WE SAID BASED ON THIRTY THREE

02:01:25.779 --> 02:01:28.414 region:rollup2
PERCENT HOW MUCH OF A TWO

02:01:27.380 --> 02:01:30.583 region:rollup2
HUNDRED THIRTY ONE MILLION.

02:01:28.414 --> 02:01:32.018 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE BEEN AVAILABLE.

02:01:30.583 --> 02:01:33.052 region:rollup2
AND IT WAS ABOUT A HUNDRED FIFTY

02:01:32.018 --> 02:01:34.687 region:rollup2
SEVEN MILLION BECAUSE THERE'S

02:01:33.052 --> 02:01:35.688 region:rollup2
FIVE AND THIRTY FIVE AND

02:01:34.687 --> 02:01:37.657 region:rollup2
RESERVES.

02:01:35.688 --> 02:01:38.992 region:rollup2
THERE WERE ABOUT ABOUT ANOTHER

02:01:37.657 --> 02:01:39.859 region:rollup2
HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN MILLION THAT

02:01:38.992 --> 02:01:41.794 region:rollup2
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA COULD OF

02:01:39.859 --> 02:01:43.763 region:rollup2
RE ALLOCATED TO THOSE FORTY SIX

02:01:41.794 --> 02:01:45.398 region:rollup2
COUNTIES. THE DIDN'T HAVE MONEY

02:01:43.763 --> 02:01:46.666 region:rollup2
THAT WAS SUBJECT TO REVERSION TO

02:01:45.398 --> 02:01:48.535 region:rollup2
THE EXTENT THEY NEED ADDITIONAL

02:01:46.666 --> 02:01:49.969 region:rollup2
FUNDING TO PROVIDE SERVICES SO

02:01:48.535 --> 02:01:51.337 region:rollup2
THIS IS AS YOU INDICATED.

02:01:49.969 --> 02:01:53.740 region:rollup2
A CRITICAL ISSUE THAT THE STATE

02:01:51.337 --> 02:01:55.475 region:rollup2
NEEDS TO NEEDS TO RESOLVE SO IF

02:01:53.740 --> 02:01:56.476 region:rollup2
I ESTABLISHED AND INVITE COULD

02:01:55.475 --> 02:01:58.578 region:rollup2
MISTER TERRIFIED ESTABLISH A

02:01:56.476 --> 02:02:02.415 region:rollup2
RESERVE.

02:01:58.578 --> 02:02:04.517 region:rollup2
A RESERVE I SAID OKAY EACH.

02:02:02.415 --> 02:02:08.922 region:rollup2
IS THE RESERVE FOR EACH COUNTY

02:02:04.517 --> 02:02:10.857 region:rollup2
OR IS IT A STATEWIDE RESERVE.

02:02:08.922 --> 02:02:12.358 region:rollup2
YOU'D BE A RESERVE LEVELS AT

02:02:10.857 --> 02:02:14.127 region:rollup2
EACH COUNTY WOULD WOULD USE

02:02:12.358 --> 02:02:14.661 region:rollup2
WOULD FALL SOVIET STEPS TO

02:02:14.127 --> 02:02:15.728 region:rollup2
RESERVE LEVEL THIRTY THREE

02:02:14.661 --> 02:02:17.163 region:rollup2
PERCENT.

02:02:15.728 --> 02:02:18.731 region:rollup2
EACH COUNTY COULD HAVE UP TO

02:02:17.163 --> 02:02:20.266 region:rollup2
THIRTY THREE PERCENT OF ITS

02:02:18.731 --> 02:02:21.301 region:rollup2
PRIOR YEAR REVENUES IN THAT OF

02:02:20.266 --> 02:02:23.303 region:rollup2
THAT ERICA.

02:02:21.301 --> 02:02:24.504 region:rollup2
AND SO IF IT WAS A THIRTY THREE

02:02:23.303 --> 02:02:25.838 region:rollup2
PERCENT LEVEL.

02:02:24.504 --> 02:02:27.373 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:02:25.838 --> 02:02:29.709 region:rollup2
SAY.

02:02:27.373 --> 02:02:30.710 region:rollup2
I PUT THE MONEY IN.

02:02:29.709 --> 02:02:32.645 region:rollup2
SAY HAVE A GOOD YEAR AND THERE'S

02:02:30.710 --> 02:02:34.113 region:rollup2
A LOT OF.

02:02:32.645 --> 02:02:35.048 region:rollup2
LOT OF MILLIONAIRES THAT WE CAN

02:02:34.113 --> 02:02:36.316 region:rollup2
TAX AND.

02:02:35.048 --> 02:02:37.951 region:rollup2
WHATEVER YOU KNOW WE TAX AND

02:02:36.316 --> 02:02:39.752 region:rollup2
I'M.

02:02:37.951 --> 02:02:41.888 region:rollup2
AND THAT A YOU CAN PUT ALL THE

02:02:39.752 --> 02:02:43.690 region:rollup2
MONEY IN A GOOD YEAR YOU CAN PUT

02:02:41.888 --> 02:02:47.894 region:rollup2
THE MONEY INTO RESERVE.

02:02:43.690 --> 02:02:49.495 region:rollup2
THAT RESERVE WILL STAY THERE.

02:02:47.894 --> 02:02:51.064 region:rollup2
AND IF THE REVENUE DECLINES IN

02:02:49.495 --> 02:02:52.632 region:rollup2
THE NEXT FEW YEARS YOU STILL

02:02:51.064 --> 02:02:54.467 region:rollup2
HAVE THAT RESERVE IN AN ACCOUNT

02:02:52.632 --> 02:02:54.934 region:rollup2
RIGHT THAT MY CORRECT.

02:02:54.467 --> 02:02:57.170 region:rollup2
SO SO.

02:02:54.934 --> 02:02:59.105 region:rollup2
.

02:02:57.170 --> 02:03:01.441 region:rollup2
IS NOT AN ANNUAL AMOUNT YOU HAVE

02:02:59.105 --> 02:03:02.775 region:rollup2
TO SET ASIDE IT IT'S NOT IT JUST

02:03:01.441 --> 02:03:04.410 region:rollup2
AS LONG AS YOU DON'T SPEND IT OF

02:03:02.775 --> 02:03:05.044 region:rollup2
COURSE GREG.

02:03:04.410 --> 02:03:07.146 region:rollup2
IT'S LIKE A RAINY DAY FUND KIND

02:03:05.044 --> 02:03:08.147 region:rollup2
OF THING.

02:03:07.146 --> 02:03:10.316 region:rollup2
LIKE WE HAVE IN OUR BUDGET

02:03:08.147 --> 02:03:11.384 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENT BUDGET REQUIRES US

02:03:10.316 --> 02:03:12.685 region:rollup2
TO HAVE A.

02:03:11.384 --> 02:03:14.020 region:rollup2
RAINY DAY FUND BUT THIS IS.

02:03:12.685 --> 02:03:15.255 region:rollup2
.

02:03:14.020 --> 02:03:17.590 region:rollup2
SO THEY CAN CONTINUE TO SPEND

02:03:15.255 --> 02:03:17.957 region:rollup2
MONEY ON PROGRAMS.

02:03:17.590 --> 02:03:19.559 region:rollup2
NOW IF YOU HAD.

02:03:17.957 --> 02:03:23.129 region:rollup2
.

02:03:19.559 --> 02:03:24.564 region:rollup2
IF YOU LOOK AT OVER FIVE YEARS.

02:03:23.129 --> 02:03:25.431 region:rollup2
AND YOU SAY OKAY HERE'S HOW MUCH

02:03:24.564 --> 02:03:27.367 region:rollup2
MONEY WE'RE GONNA SPEND OVER

02:03:25.431 --> 02:03:29.002 region:rollup2
FIVE YEARS.

02:03:27.367 --> 02:03:30.770 region:rollup2
AND FOR FIVE STRAIGHT YEARS YOU

02:03:29.002 --> 02:03:32.305 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE TO HAVE THE USE OF

02:03:30.770 --> 02:03:32.572 region:rollup2
THAT RESERVE.

02:03:32.305 --> 02:03:33.606 region:rollup2
HOW MUCH?

02:03:32.572 --> 02:03:35.408 region:rollup2
?

02:03:33.606 --> 02:03:38.912 region:rollup2
OF THE.

02:03:35.408 --> 02:03:41.114 region:rollup2
FIVE YEAR ALLOCATION WOULD BE.

02:03:38.912 --> 02:03:42.882 region:rollup2
USED FOR RESERVE.

02:03:41.114 --> 02:03:43.950 region:rollup2
IT WON'T BE A A WOULD BE THAT

02:03:42.882 --> 02:03:45.985 region:rollup2
MUCH CORRECT.

02:03:43.950 --> 02:03:48.821 region:rollup2
BUT IF.

02:03:45.985 --> 02:03:50.523 region:rollup2
YEAH IF. IF THERE WAS NO NEED TO

02:03:48.821 --> 02:03:52.058 region:rollup2
DRAW DOWN THE RESERVE TO IF YOU

02:03:50.523 --> 02:03:53.927 region:rollup2
QUITE YEAH YES IF YOUR QUESTION

02:03:52.058 --> 02:03:55.361 region:rollup2
IS THAT. THAT THEIR REVENUES

02:03:53.927 --> 02:03:57.297 region:rollup2
WERE SUFFICIENT AND ALL FIVE

02:03:55.361 --> 02:03:58.464 region:rollup2
YEARS OVER IT FOR FOR THE PLAN

02:03:57.297 --> 02:03:59.999 region:rollup2
FOR THE FOUR OF THEM BY THE

02:03:58.464 --> 02:04:01.734 region:rollup2
PROGRAM IN THE FUNDING THAT YOU.

02:03:59.999 --> 02:04:03.202 region:rollup2
HAD PLANNED FOR THEN YOU

02:04:01.734 --> 02:04:04.304 region:rollup2
WOULDN'T NEED TO TOUCH THOSE

02:04:03.202 --> 02:04:05.338 region:rollup2
RESERVES THEY WOULD STAY THERE.

02:04:04.304 --> 02:04:07.273 region:rollup2
NOW THE COUNTY'S.

02:04:05.338 --> 02:04:08.908 region:rollup2
DON'T TO SPEND THAT MONEY ON

02:04:07.273 --> 02:04:10.109 region:rollup2
ONGOING SERVICES THEY SPEND IT

02:04:08.908 --> 02:04:11.444 region:rollup2
ON ONE TIME SERVICES AS WELL

02:04:10.109 --> 02:04:13.012 region:rollup2
RIGHT.

02:04:11.444 --> 02:04:14.814 region:rollup2
CORRECT THERE'S MONEY SPENT ON

02:04:13.012 --> 02:04:16.482 region:rollup2
CAPITOL OTHER KINDS OF.

02:04:14.814 --> 02:04:17.817 region:rollup2
AND IF YOU HAD A BAD YEAR YOU

02:04:16.482 --> 02:04:19.152 region:rollup2
JUST DON'T SPEND THE MONEY ON A

02:04:17.817 --> 02:04:20.753 region:rollup2
CAPITAL PROJECT BUT YOU CAN

02:04:19.152 --> 02:04:22.588 region:rollup2
CONTINUE SPENDING.

02:04:20.753 --> 02:04:24.624 region:rollup2
MONEY ON THE A ONGOING PROJECT

02:04:22.588 --> 02:04:26.159 region:rollup2
IS THAT CORRECT.

02:04:24.624 --> 02:04:28.461 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S ANOTHER WAY OF

02:04:26.159 --> 02:04:30.263 region:rollup2
REDUCING YOUR EXPENDITURES BY.

02:04:28.461 --> 02:04:32.298 region:rollup2
DEFERRING OR SPREADING OUT THE

02:04:30.263 --> 02:04:34.133 region:rollup2
COST OF THE.

02:04:32.298 --> 02:04:36.069 region:rollup2
CITY A CAPITAL PROJECT THAT YOU

02:04:34.133 --> 02:04:38.805 region:rollup2
WANT TO SPEND THE MONEY ON.

02:04:36.069 --> 02:04:39.639 region:rollup2
WHATEVER I DON'T KNOW WE'D HAVE

02:04:38.805 --> 02:04:41.607 region:rollup2
TO LOOK AT THE LIST OF CAPITAL

02:04:39.639 --> 02:04:42.842 region:rollup2
PROJECTS.

02:04:41.607 --> 02:04:46.312 region:rollup2
SO IS THERE ANOTHER WAY TO

02:04:42.842 --> 02:04:47.847 region:rollup2
REGULATE THE FLOW OF THE CASH.

02:04:46.312 --> 02:04:49.115 region:rollup2
AND PROTECT A RESERVE. IT IT

02:04:47.847 --> 02:04:51.517 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY WOULD BE.

02:04:49.115 --> 02:04:51.718 region:rollup2
OKAY SO OUT MISTER CHAIRMAN I

02:04:51.517 --> 02:04:51.985 region:rollup2
THINK.

02:04:51.718 --> 02:04:54.354 region:rollup2
I THINK.

02:04:51.985 --> 02:04:57.457 region:rollup2
.

02:04:54.354 --> 02:04:59.192 region:rollup2
THE RESERVE. POLICY.

02:04:57.457 --> 02:05:01.861 region:rollup2
TO ME IT'S ONE OF THE CENTRAL

02:04:59.192 --> 02:05:04.197 region:rollup2
POINTS OF THIS AUDIT.

02:05:01.861 --> 02:05:05.998 region:rollup2
AND AND AND BECAUSE IF WE SET

02:05:04.197 --> 02:05:07.934 region:rollup2
THE RESERVE TO HIGH.

02:05:05.998 --> 02:05:10.636 region:rollup2
IT WILL RESULT IN MONEY THAT THE

02:05:07.934 --> 02:05:12.672 region:rollup2
VOTERS APPROVED.

02:05:10.636 --> 02:05:14.007 region:rollup2
NOT BEING SPENT ON THE PURPOSE

02:05:12.672 --> 02:05:15.007 region:rollup2
OF WHICH THE VOTERS DECIDE AND

02:05:14.007 --> 02:05:17.010 region:rollup2
WHAT THE MONEY FOR.

02:05:15.007 --> 02:05:18.177 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S.

02:05:17.010 --> 02:05:21.414 region:rollup2
TO MEET TO ME THAT'S A VERY

02:05:18.177 --> 02:05:23.583 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT REAL REAL THING.

02:05:21.414 --> 02:05:24.550 region:rollup2
AND I THINK WE HAVE TO BE VERY

02:05:23.583 --> 02:05:25.818 region:rollup2
CAUTIOUS ABOUT SETTING THE

02:05:24.550 --> 02:05:29.122 region:rollup2
RESERVE.

02:05:25.818 --> 02:05:30.590 region:rollup2
TOO HIGH.

02:05:29.122 --> 02:05:33.092 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THERE HAS TO BE

02:05:30.590 --> 02:05:34.961 region:rollup2
POLICIES A BACKUP TO RESERVE AND

02:05:33.092 --> 02:05:36.195 region:rollup2
BACK UP THE EXPENDITURES AND

02:05:34.961 --> 02:05:37.130 region:rollup2
THOSE POLICIES RECOMMENDED BY

02:05:36.195 --> 02:05:38.631 region:rollup2
THE AUTHOR I THINK THE

02:05:37.130 --> 02:05:40.099 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT AGREED TO THOSE RIGHT

02:05:38.631 --> 02:05:42.301 region:rollup2
IS THAT CORRECT.

02:05:40.099 --> 02:05:43.503 region:rollup2
SO NOW WE WE DISAGREE ON THE

02:05:42.301 --> 02:05:44.904 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF THE RESERVE BUT I

02:05:43.503 --> 02:05:46.706 region:rollup2
THINK I WAS I WAS ONE AREA BUT

02:05:44.904 --> 02:05:47.940 region:rollup2
NO OTHER AREAS THERE WASN'T TOO

02:05:46.706 --> 02:05:48.908 region:rollup2
MANY OTHERS YOU DISAGREED WITH

02:05:47.940 --> 02:05:51.277 region:rollup2
RIGHT.

02:05:48.908 --> 02:05:53.079 region:rollup2
NO THE TIMING OF THE FISCAL

02:05:51.277 --> 02:05:54.414 region:rollup2
REGULATIONS SO THERE IS A

02:05:53.079 --> 02:05:56.849 region:rollup2

SPECIAL THE ONES ARE PAYING.

02:10:13.306 --> 02:10:16.409 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY HAVE A MILLION

THINGS AND SO WE HAVE A. LOT OF

02:10:34.694 --> 02:10:37.029 region:rollup2
WORK THAT HAS BEEN DONE SINCE

02:10:35.294 --> 02:10:38.531 region:rollup2
WE.

02:10:37.029 --> 02:10:40.366 region:rollup2
TOOK OVER THE OVERSIGHT.

02:10:38.531 --> 02:10:41.901 region:rollup2
SO THIS WAS A DEPARTMENTS.

02:10:40.366 --> 02:10:43.369 region:rollup2
FUNCTION THAT CAME TO US IN TWO

02:10:41.901 --> 02:10:45.304 region:rollup2
THOUSAND AND TWELVE.

02:10:43.369 --> 02:10:46.605 region:rollup2
AND IT HAS CHANGED A COUPLE OF

02:10:45.304 --> 02:10:49.041 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT TIMES RIGHT THE

02:10:46.605 --> 02:10:49.642 region:rollup2
INITIATIVE AS IT WAS ORIGINALLY

02:10:49.041 --> 02:10:51.711 region:rollup2
PASSED BY THE VOTERS HAS BEEN

02:10:49.642 --> 02:10:52.812 region:rollup2
MODIFIED. A COUPLE TIMES UNDER

02:10:51.711 --> 02:10:54.547 region:rollup2
THE FORMER DEPARTMENT THAT

02:10:52.812 --> 02:10:56.115 region:rollup2
ADMINISTERED IT IT USED TO BE

02:10:54.547 --> 02:10:57.550 region:rollup2
THAT THE STATE HELD THE FUNDS

02:10:56.115 --> 02:10:59.351 region:rollup2
AND THE COUNTY HAD TO COME.

02:10:57.550 --> 02:11:00.186 region:rollup2
AND GET THE FUNDS ALLOCATED TO

02:10:59.351 --> 02:11:01.287 region:rollup2
IT AND THEN THERE IS A

02:11:00.186 --> 02:11:03.689 region:rollup2
FUNDAMENTAL SHIFT.

02:11:01.287 --> 02:11:04.623 region:rollup2
SEVERAL YEARS AFTER THAT WHERE

02:11:03.689 --> 02:11:06.158 region:rollup2
THE COUNTY SAID THIS IS.

02:11:04.623 --> 02:11:07.460 region:rollup2
NOT AS FLEXIBLE AS WE NEED IT

02:11:06.158 --> 02:11:09.395 region:rollup2
TO BE INSIDE THE INITIATIVE WAS

02:11:07.460 --> 02:11:10.796 region:rollup2
CHANGED TO SAY THE FUNDS FUND

02:11:09.395 --> 02:11:12.198 region:rollup2
FROM THE TAX

02:11:10.796 --> 02:11:13.632 region:rollup2
GO STRAIGHT TO THE COUNTIES AND

02:11:12.198 --> 02:11:15.801 region:rollup2
THEN THERE WAS AN OVERSIGHT.

02:11:13.632 --> 02:11:16.268 region:rollup2
CHANGE I AM I THINK YOU KNOW YOU

02:11:15.801 --> 02:11:18.404 region:rollup2
SAY IT.

02:11:16.268 --> 02:11:20.206 region:rollup2
REALLY WELL AND THAT WE HAVE A

02:11:18.404 --> 02:11:21.774 region:rollup2
REALLY BIG DEPARTMENT ITH A LOT

02:11:20.206 --> 02:11:23.943 region:rollup2
OF COMPLICATED.

02:11:21.774 --> 02:11:25.611 region:rollup2
PIECES A LOT OF.

02:11:23.943 --> 02:11:27.213 region:rollup2
OVERSIGHT MECHANISMS BOTH AT

02:11:25.611 --> 02:11:28.147 region:rollup2
THE STATE AND FEDERAL LEVEL WE

02:11:27.213 --> 02:11:30.382 region:rollup2
WELCOME.

02:11:28.147 --> 02:11:31.851 region:rollup2
OVERSIGHT I WILL ALWAYS SAY

02:11:30.382 --> 02:11:32.918 region:rollup2
THAT THERE IS ALWAYS ROOM FOR

02:11:31.851 --> 02:11:35.454 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENT BOTH IN THIS

02:11:32.918 --> 02:11:37.189 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR AREA AS WELL AS IN

02:11:35.454 --> 02:11:38.624 region:rollup2
OTHER PARTS OF OUR DEPARTMENT.

02:11:37.189 --> 02:11:39.825 region:rollup2
I THINK WE HAVE BEEN.

02:11:38.624 --> 02:11:41.227 region:rollup2
.

02:11:39.825 --> 02:11:42.628 region:rollup2
WORKING REALLY DILIGENTLY WITH

02:11:41.227 --> 02:11:43.996 region:rollup2
THE COUNTIES TO ISSUE GUIDANCE

02:11:42.628 --> 02:11:46.632 region:rollup2
ON BOTH THE PROGRAMMATIC.

02:11:43.996 --> 02:11:49.702 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS.

02:11:46.632 --> 02:11:50.302 region:rollup2
ACT AS WELL AS OTHER PIECES OF

02:11:49.702 --> 02:11:51.937 region:rollup2
THE MENTAL HEALTH DELIVERY

02:11:50.302 --> 02:11:53.472 region:rollup2
SYSTEM SO I I JUST WANT TO.

02:11:51.937 --> 02:11:55.007 region:rollup2
REMIND YOU THAT. THAT MENTAL

02:11:53.472 --> 02:11:56.776 region:rollup2
HEALTH SERVICES ACT IS ONE

02:11:55.007 --> 02:11:58.444 region:rollup2
COMPONENT OF A MUCH BROADER

02:11:56.776 --> 02:12:00.646 region:rollup2
MENTAL HEALTH DELIVERY SYSTEM SO

02:11:58.444 --> 02:12:02.181 region:rollup2
WHEN WE ARE WORKING WITH THE

02:12:00.646 --> 02:12:03.983 region:rollup2
COUNTIES AROUND GUIDANCE WERE

02:12:02.181 --> 02:12:05.518 region:rollup2
NOT ONLY LOOKING TO THEM AROUND

02:12:03.983 --> 02:12:06.952 region:rollup2
MHSAA BUT WE'RE ALSO WORKING

02:12:05.518 --> 02:12:09.221 region:rollup2
WITH THEM AS IT PERTAINS TO MEDI

02:12:06.952 --> 02:12:11.724 region:rollup2
CAL. BOTH PEDIATRIC AND ADULT

02:12:09.221 --> 02:12:13.893 region:rollup2
POPULATIONS AND SO I THINK THESE

02:12:11.724 --> 02:12:15.861 region:rollup2
REGULATIONS HAVE TAKEN AWHILE

02:12:13.893 --> 02:12:18.097 region:rollup2
THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER. KIND OF

02:12:15.861 --> 02:12:19.432 region:rollup2
FUN PRESSING EITHER ISSUES THERE

02:12:18.097 --> 02:12:21.801 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN OTHER.

02:12:19.432 --> 02:12:23.302 region:rollup2
WORK THAT WE'VE DONE WITH THE

02:12:21.801 --> 02:12:24.670 region:rollup2
COUNTIES AROUND RECONCILIATIONS

02:12:23.302 --> 02:12:25.905 region:rollup2
AND SO I JUST.

02:12:24.670 --> 02:12:27.973 region:rollup2
I'M NOT MAKING.

02:12:25.905 --> 02:12:29.508 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY EXCUSES I'M JUST

02:12:27.973 --> 02:12:31.744 region:rollup2
SAYING IT IS A REALLY BIG.

02:12:29.508 --> 02:12:33.012 region:rollup2
COMPLEMENT IN WHICH WE WORK.

02:12:31.744 --> 02:12:34.213 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW REALLY WELL WITH FIFTY

02:12:33.012 --> 02:12:35.047 region:rollup2
SIX DIFFERENT COUNTIES BUT WE

02:12:34.213 --> 02:12:36.715 region:rollup2
WORKED FIFTY SIX DIFFERENT

02:12:35.047 --> 02:12:37.683 region:rollup2
COUNTIES AND SO I THINK THE

02:12:36.715 --> 02:12:40.052 region:rollup2
AUDIT RAISED.

02:12:37.683 --> 02:12:41.821 region:rollup2
FAIR POINTS WE ACKNOWLEDGED

02:12:40.052 --> 02:12:44.557 region:rollup2
WHAT THOSE ARE WE ARE WORKING TO

02:12:41.821 --> 02:12:46.392 region:rollup2
MEET THE RECOMMENDATIONS AS WE.

02:12:44.557 --> 02:12:46.959 region:rollup2
I AGREE WITH THEM IN THE AUDIT

02:12:46.392 --> 02:12:48.594 region:rollup2
AND I THINK.

02:12:46.959 --> 02:12:50.863 region:rollup2
EITHER THE ONLY AT THE LAST

02:12:48.594 --> 02:12:52.298 region:rollup2
THING I WOULD SAY IS WE ALSO

02:12:50.863 --> 02:12:53.933 region:rollup2
GIVEN LIMITED RESOURCES WITHIN A

02:12:52.298 --> 02:12:55.701 region:rollup2
STATE GOVERNMENT BECAUSE. YOU'LL

02:12:53.933 --> 02:12:57.002 region:rollup2
NEVER HAVE AND YOU KNOW THIS

02:12:55.701 --> 02:12:58.471 region:rollup2
COMING FROM AYE AYE COUNTY

02:12:57.002 --> 02:13:00.739 region:rollup2
THERE'S NEVER ENOUGH

02:12:58.471 --> 02:13:02.274 region:rollup2
RESOURCES TO DO. A WHOLE HUNDRED

02:13:00.739 --> 02:13:04.109 region:rollup2
PERCENT AND SO WE ALSO TRY TO

02:13:02.274 --> 02:13:05.511 region:rollup2
TARGET OUR LIMITED RESOURCES TO

02:13:04.109 --> 02:13:07.179 region:rollup2
THE AREAS THAT WE THINK. ARE

02:13:05.511 --> 02:13:09.448 region:rollup2
HIGHEST RISK.

02:13:07.179 --> 02:13:11.717 region:rollup2
IMAGE TO SAY.

02:13:09.448 --> 02:13:13.452 region:rollup2
THERE HAS NOT EVER BEEN AN

02:13:11.717 --> 02:13:15.254 region:rollup2
ALLEGATION WHERE THE FUNDS HAVE

02:13:13.452 --> 02:13:16.422 region:rollup2
BEEN USED INAPPROPRIATELY AND SO

02:13:15.254 --> 02:13:17.890 region:rollup2
I REALLY WANT TO STRESS THAT AS

02:13:16.422 --> 02:13:19.492 region:rollup2
WELL IS THAT WE ARE IN A PLACE

02:13:17.890 --> 02:13:20.826 region:rollup2
WHERE THE COUNTIES. HAVE NOT

02:13:19.492 --> 02:13:23.295 region:rollup2
USED FUNDS.

02:13:20.826 --> 02:13:24.763 region:rollup2
AS QUICKLY AS WE WANTED THEM TO

02:13:23.295 --> 02:13:26.065 region:rollup2
WE ARE WORKING TO SOLVE THAT.

02:13:24.763 --> 02:13:27.032 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK WE ALSO AS A

02:13:26.065 --> 02:13:28.501 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT.

02:13:27.032 --> 02:13:30.269 region:rollup2
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT PROGRAM

02:13:28.501 --> 02:13:33.205 region:rollup2
INTEGRITY WE HAVE ALSO FOCUSED

02:13:30.269 --> 02:13:35.307 region:rollup2
IN AREAS WHERE WE HAD OTHER MORE

02:13:33.205 --> 02:13:36.575 region:rollup2
HIGHER PRIORITY ISSUES AROUND

02:13:35.307 --> 02:13:37.810 region:rollup2
PROGRAM INTEGRITY SO I JUST. YOU

02:13:36.575 --> 02:13:40.813 region:rollup2
KNOW WHEN YOU'RE NOT AN

02:13:37.810 --> 02:13:43.048 region:rollup2
EXECUTIVE AS YOU STATED I'M.

02:13:40.813 --> 02:13:45.150 region:rollup2
I HAVE I WORK WITH AS MUCH AS

02:13:43.048 --> 02:13:46.785 region:rollup2
I'M CAPACITY AS I HAVE AT THE

02:13:45.150 --> 02:13:48.287 region:rollup2
TIME AND WE TARGET THE HIGHEST

02:13:46.785 --> 02:13:49.688 region:rollup2
EITHER NEED OUR HIGHEST PRIORITY

02:13:48.287 --> 02:13:52.024 region:rollup2
AND THIS IS DEFINITELY. A

02:13:49.688 --> 02:13:54.627 region:rollup2
PRIORITY BUT IT CERTAINLY HAS.

02:13:52.024 --> 02:13:55.761 region:rollup2
HAD A LOT OF DIFFERENT IMPACTS

02:13:54.627 --> 02:13:57.596 region:rollup2
ON IT AS THE YEARS HAVE.

02:13:55.761 --> 02:13:58.731 region:rollup2
.

02:13:57.596 --> 02:14:00.499 region:rollup2
AS WE HAVE HAD IT SINCE IT CAME

02:13:58.731 --> 02:14:02.201 region:rollup2
TO US IN TWENTY TWELVE

02:14:00.499 --> 02:14:03.869 region:rollup2
SO PROP SIXTY THREE DID IT A

02:14:02.201 --> 02:14:05.938 region:rollup2
PROVIDE A AND ADMINISTRATIVE

02:14:03.869 --> 02:14:07.606 region:rollup2
COMPONENT. STRIKE ONE PERCENT OR

02:14:05.938 --> 02:14:08.674 region:rollup2
TWO PERCENT OR FIVE PERCENT OF

02:14:07.606 --> 02:14:10.242 region:rollup2
THE MONEY WILL BE USED FOR

02:14:08.674 --> 02:14:13.345 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION THAT'S RIGHT. SO

02:14:10.242 --> 02:14:15.114 region:rollup2
THEN WHO DO YOU HAVE A MHSAA

02:14:13.345 --> 02:14:17.650 region:rollup2
DIRECTOR THAT OVERSEES THE FIFTY

02:14:15.114 --> 02:14:18.584 region:rollup2
EIGHT COUNTIES NO SO I HAVE

02:14:17.650 --> 02:14:22.021 region:rollup2
GOING ON.

02:14:18.584 --> 02:14:23.522 region:rollup2
NEW.

02:14:22.021 --> 02:14:24.723 region:rollup2
I'M HAVING TROUBLE WITH YOUR

02:14:23.522 --> 02:14:26.392 region:rollup2
RIGHT RESPONSE AND WE HAVE

02:14:24.723 --> 02:14:28.193 region:rollup2
LIMITED RESOURCES WHEN YOU

02:14:26.392 --> 02:14:29.128 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY HAVE RESOURCE RIGHT.

02:14:28.193 --> 02:14:31.330 region:rollup2
SO WE HAVE.

02:14:29.128 --> 02:14:34.133 region:rollup2
WE HAVE RECEIVE STAFF IN THE NO

02:14:31.330 --> 02:14:35.768 region:rollup2
PLACE LIKE HOME TO DO PROGRAM

02:14:34.133 --> 02:14:38.270 region:rollup2
AUDITS SO THOSE POSITIONS CAME

02:14:35.768 --> 02:14:39.939 region:rollup2
TO US LAST YEAR.

02:14:38.270 --> 02:14:41.073 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN SO THAT WAS

02:14:39.939 --> 02:14:43.042 region:rollup2
THE FIRST TIME WE HAD.

02:14:41.073 --> 02:14:44.577 region:rollup2
RESOURCES ALLOCATED TO.

02:14:43.042 --> 02:14:47.446 region:rollup2
LOOK AT THE PROGRAMMATIC

02:14:44.577 --> 02:14:49.882 region:rollup2
FUNCTIONS OF MHSAA WE HAVE.

02:14:47.446 --> 02:14:51.183 region:rollup2
MAYBE TWELVE OR THIRTEEN STAFF

02:14:49.882 --> 02:14:52.484 region:rollup2
TOTAL THAT OUR IMAGE IT'S A

02:14:51.183 --> 02:14:54.119 region:rollup2
FUNDED WITHIN A DEPARTMENT

02:14:52.484 --> 02:14:55.988 region:rollup2
WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT. AND THEN

02:14:54.119 --> 02:14:58.023 region:rollup2
WHAT WE DO IS WE HAVE STAFF THAT

02:14:55.988 --> 02:14:59.558 region:rollup2
HANDLE MULTIPLE COMPONENTS THAT

02:14:58.023 --> 02:15:02.361 region:rollup2
ARE NOT JUST MHSAA.

02:14:59.558 --> 02:15:04.630 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC SO I HAVE CERTAIN

02:15:02.361 --> 02:15:05.230 region:rollup2
FISCAL EXPERTS THAT NOT ONLY

02:15:04.630 --> 02:15:11.537 region:rollup2
HELP ON THE EPS DUTY AND SO WE

02:15:05.230 --> 02:15:14.974 region:rollup2
USE.

02:15:11.537 --> 02:15:17.276 region:rollup2
STAFF ACROSS MULTIPLE PROGRAMS

02:15:14.974 --> 02:15:18.978 region:rollup2
BUT SPECIFICALLY FUNDED ON MHSAA

02:15:17.276 --> 02:15:20.579 region:rollup2
IT'S A FAIRLY SMALL NUMBER OF

02:15:18.978 --> 02:15:21.947 region:rollup2
STAFF AND THAT'S PUBLIC TWELVE

02:15:20.579 --> 02:15:22.815 region:rollup2
OR THIRTEEN AND A DEPARTMENT OF

02:15:21.947 --> 02:15:24.850 region:rollup2
FOR THOUSANDS.

02:15:22.815 --> 02:15:26.986 region:rollup2
BUT THAT'S A KEY FUNDING SOURCE

02:15:24.850 --> 02:15:29.388 region:rollup2
AND IT WOULDN'T BE A KEY MANAGER

02:15:26.986 --> 02:15:30.990 region:rollup2
AND YOURS. ORG CHART.

02:15:29.388 --> 02:15:33.058 region:rollup2
WELL IT'S A IT'S A FUNDING

02:15:30.990 --> 02:15:34.660 region:rollup2
SOURCE IN MY DEPARTMENT IT'S

02:15:33.058 --> 02:15:37.396 region:rollup2
ABOUT TWO AND A HALF THREE

02:15:34.660 --> 02:15:38.497 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS IN A.

02:15:37.396 --> 02:15:41.734 region:rollup2
STATEWIDE OPERATIONS BUDGET OF

02:15:38.497 --> 02:15:43.869 region:rollup2
OVER SIX HUNDRED MILLION.

02:15:41.734 --> 02:15:45.771 region:rollup2
BUT YOU HAVE AN EXPENDITURE HAD

02:15:43.869 --> 02:15:47.706 region:rollup2
THE RESOURCES THAT. I'M HAVING

02:15:45.771 --> 02:15:49.074 region:rollup2
TROUBLE DEAR DIGESTING THAT SO

02:15:47.706 --> 02:15:52.044 region:rollup2
SO YOU'VE HAD IT FOR A FEW YEARS

02:15:49.074 --> 02:15:55.848 region:rollup2
WHERE IS THE STRATEGIC PLAN.

02:15:52.044 --> 02:15:56.415 region:rollup2
SO WHEN YOU SAY SO WE SO THE SO

02:15:55.848 --> 02:15:57.282 region:rollup2
THE INITIATIVE DOESN'T CALL

02:15:56.415 --> 02:15:58.984 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY FOR US TO HAVE A

02:15:57.282 --> 02:16:01.487 region:rollup2
STRATEGIC PLAN I THINK WE WORK

02:15:58.984 --> 02:16:04.923 region:rollup2
WITH THE COMMISSION IN TERMS OF.

02:16:01.487 --> 02:16:06.191 region:rollup2
HELPING SET POLICY AROUND WHAT

02:16:04.923 --> 02:16:07.059 region:rollup2
THE COUNTIES CAN USE THEIR MHSAA

02:16:06.191 --> 02:16:09.528 region:rollup2
FUNDING FOR BUT THERE'S NOT

02:16:07.059 --> 02:16:11.063 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY A STRATEGIC PLAN FOR

02:16:09.528 --> 02:16:12.064 region:rollup2
ME TO SAY THAT WE AS A

02:16:11.063 --> 02:16:13.632 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT ARE.

02:16:12.064 --> 02:16:15.334 region:rollup2
EITHER CHARGED WITH I THINK

02:16:13.632 --> 02:16:16.535 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:16:15.334 --> 02:16:17.703 region:rollup2
WE WORK.

02:16:16.535 --> 02:16:19.471 region:rollup2
BOTH WITH LEGISLATORS AND

02:16:17.703 --> 02:16:21.940 region:rollup2
OTHERS TO HELP SET.

02:16:19.471 --> 02:16:22.474 region:rollup2
GUIDANCE AROUND CERTAIN

02:16:21.940 --> 02:16:23.676 region:rollup2
INITIATIVES BUT WE DON'T

02:16:22.474 --> 02:16:24.543 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY HAVE A STRATEGIC

02:16:23.676 --> 02:16:27.846 region:rollup2
PLAN THAT WE HAVE.

02:16:24.543 --> 02:16:29.081 region:rollup2
SO.

02:16:27.846 --> 02:16:29.982 region:rollup2
A MY WORDS. IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE

02:16:29.081 --> 02:16:33.318 region:rollup2
GOT.

02:16:29.982 --> 02:16:35.621 region:rollup2
A COMPONENT OF YOUR OPERATION

02:16:33.318 --> 02:16:36.889 region:rollup2
THAT SORTA LIKE A RENTAL IS BOAT

02:16:35.621 --> 02:16:39.525 region:rollup2
WHICH IS KINDA JUST.

02:16:36.889 --> 02:16:40.159 region:rollup2
FLOATING THERE AND I'M.

02:16:39.525 --> 02:16:41.193 region:rollup2
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO HOW

02:16:40.159 --> 02:16:41.994 region:rollup2
THAT EVEN HAPPENS.

02:16:41.193 --> 02:16:43.529 region:rollup2
I'M

02:16:41.994 --> 02:16:44.063 region:rollup2
SO THERE'S BEEN THIS CONCERN

02:16:43.529 --> 02:16:47.399 region:rollup2
ABOUT LACK OF LEADERSHIP.

02:16:44.063 --> 02:16:49.101 region:rollup2
SO.

02:16:47.399 --> 02:16:50.536 region:rollup2
IT THAT'S I GUESS MY LAST

02:16:49.101 --> 02:16:51.804 region:rollup2
QUESTION MR CHARITY. WHY DO WE

02:16:50.536 --> 02:16:52.471 region:rollup2
HAVE TO DO LEGISLATION TO TELL

02:16:51.804 --> 02:16:53.772 region:rollup2
YOU TO FIND A LEADER AND TO DO A

02:16:52.471 --> 02:16:55.708 region:rollup2
STRATEGIC PLAN WHY ISN'T THAT

02:16:53.772 --> 02:16:58.243 region:rollup2
JUST?

02:16:55.708 --> 02:16:58.877 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW DEBT JUST COMES FROM

02:16:58.243 --> 02:16:59.344 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT WHAT AND WHY IS THAT

02:16:58.877 --> 02:17:02.614 region:rollup2
JUST.

02:16:59.344 --> 02:17:04.416 region:rollup2
WISEMAN BEEN THERE.

02:17:02.614 --> 02:17:05.451 region:rollup2
SO A COUPLE THINGS.

02:17:04.416 --> 02:17:06.251 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT IT'S IT'S NOT

02:17:05.451 --> 02:17:07.853 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY WHAT I WOULD

02:17:06.251 --> 02:17:09.388 region:rollup2
CONSIDER TO BE RUDDERLESS I

02:17:07.853 --> 02:17:10.956 region:rollup2
WOULD CHALLENGE THAT JUST A

02:17:09.388 --> 02:17:12.091 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT FROM THE STANDPOINT

02:17:10.956 --> 02:17:13.659 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE.

02:17:12.091 --> 02:17:15.894 region:rollup2
HAD PROGRAMMATIC GUIDANCE OUT TO

02:17:13.659 --> 02:17:17.863 region:rollup2
THE COUNTIES.

02:17:15.894 --> 02:17:19.998 region:rollup2
ON THE IMAGE TO SAY FUNDING WE

02:17:17.863 --> 02:17:21.133 region:rollup2
HAVE AYE REGULATIONS WE HAVE

02:17:19.998 --> 02:17:22.935 region:rollup2
CERTAIN GUIDANCE DOCUMENTS.

02:17:21.133 --> 02:17:24.670 region:rollup2
.

02:17:22.935 --> 02:17:26.438 region:rollup2
I THINK WHAT WE ALSO.

02:17:24.670 --> 02:17:28.173 region:rollup2
THERE'S A CAREFUL BALANCE

02:17:26.438 --> 02:17:30.476 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE INITIATIVE.

02:17:28.173 --> 02:17:33.045 region:rollup2
AS WAS MENTIONED IN A PREVIOUS

02:17:30.476 --> 02:17:34.880 region:rollup2
PANEL IT WAS INTENDED AND

02:17:33.045 --> 02:17:36.115 region:rollup2
CAREFULLY CRAFTED TO MAKE IT A

02:17:34.880 --> 02:17:38.517 region:rollup2
LOCAL DECISION.

02:17:36.115 --> 02:17:40.052 region:rollup2
A LOCALLY APPROVED AND THE

02:17:38.517 --> 02:17:41.754 region:rollup2
LOCALLY DETERMINES

02:17:40.052 --> 02:17:43.255 region:rollup2
ALLOCATION PROCESS SO I THINK

02:17:41.754 --> 02:17:44.723 region:rollup2
THAT THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN AN

02:17:43.255 --> 02:17:45.357 region:rollup2
INHERENT TENSION.

02:17:44.723 --> 02:17:47.359 region:rollup2
BETWEEN.

02:17:45.357 --> 02:17:48.861 region:rollup2
THE STATE AND THE COUNTIES FOR

02:17:47.359 --> 02:17:50.729 region:rollup2
WHICH THEY ARE.

02:17:48.861 --> 02:17:51.396 region:rollup2
SETTING THEIR OWN BUDGETS

02:17:50.729 --> 02:17:52.965 region:rollup2
THEY'RE WORKING WITH THE COUNTY

02:17:51.396 --> 02:17:54.533 region:rollup2
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS ARE WORKING

02:17:52.965 --> 02:17:55.601 region:rollup2
WITH THEIR PLANNING. COUNCILS

02:17:54.533 --> 02:17:58.270 region:rollup2
ARE WORKING WITH THEIR LOCAL

02:17:55.601 --> 02:18:00.305 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDERS AND IT IS A GROUND

02:17:58.270 --> 02:18:00.572 region:rollup2
UP EXPENDITURE AND A AND A

02:18:00.305 --> 02:18:01.640 region:rollup2
GROUND UP.

02:18:00.572 --> 02:18:04.676 region:rollup2
.

02:18:01.640 --> 02:18:05.944 region:rollup2
DRIVEN MECHANISM AND SO I THINK

02:18:04.676 --> 02:18:07.880 region:rollup2
WE ARE NOT AS THE STATE

02:18:05.944 --> 02:18:09.748 region:rollup2
AUTHORIZED OR OTHERWISE ALLOWED

02:18:07.880 --> 02:18:11.316 region:rollup2
TO COME IN AND SO THAT'S ALSO

02:18:09.748 --> 02:18:12.818 region:rollup2
BEEN ATTENTION THAT WE HAVE BEEN

02:18:11.316 --> 02:18:14.553 region:rollup2
TRY WE'VE TRIED TO BE RESPECTFUL

02:18:12.818 --> 02:18:16.688 region:rollup2
I THINK OF HOW THE INITIATIVE

02:18:14.553 --> 02:18:18.924 region:rollup2
WAS DRAFTED AND WE DO NOT.

02:18:16.688 --> 02:18:19.858 region:rollup2
EXCEED OUR THIRTY I'M IN AREAS

02:18:18.924 --> 02:18:21.660 region:rollup2
WHERE WE HAVE NOT BEEN OTHERWISE

02:18:19.858 --> 02:18:24.897 region:rollup2
AUTHORIZED I THINK THAT'S ALSO

02:18:21.660 --> 02:18:26.064 region:rollup2
WHAT WE TRY TO BE MINDFUL THAT.

02:18:24.897 --> 02:18:27.332 region:rollup2
JANET NGUYEN CLOSING.

02:18:26.064 --> 02:18:30.002 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A STATE LIBRARIAN AND I

02:18:27.332 --> 02:18:32.004 region:rollup2
SEE HIM ALL OVER THE STATE.

02:18:30.002 --> 02:18:33.305 region:rollup2
HELPING COUNTIES

02:18:32.004 --> 02:18:33.939 region:rollup2
WITH THEIR LIBRARIES I I WOULD

02:18:33.305 --> 02:18:35.040 region:rollup2
SAY THAT YOU MIGHT WANNA LOOK AT

02:18:33.939 --> 02:18:37.042 region:rollup2

02:19:03.702 --> 02:19:06.238 region:rollup2
THAT I WOULD HAVE A DISCUSSION

02:19:05.637 --> 02:19:06.772 region:rollup2
ABOUT HOW MUCH YOU DESERVE BUT

02:19:06.238 --> 02:19:08.640 region:rollup2

UP ON THAT HE BROUGHT UP IS IS

02:19:09.241 --> 02:19:13.779 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:19:11.076 --> 02:19:16.248 region:rollup2
SHOULD THE RESERVE. BE.

02:19:13.779 --> 02:19:17.916 region:rollup2
JUST A RESERVE FOR EACH COUNTY

02:19:16.248 --> 02:19:20.152 region:rollup2
OR SHOULD IT BE SPECIFICALLY

02:19:17.916 --> 02:19:21.019 region:rollup2
ALLOCATED TO SPECIFIC PROJECTS

02:19:20.152 --> 02:19:22.621 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I CAN SEE YES WITH A

02:19:21.019 --> 02:19:24.256 region:rollup2
VAULT HOUSE.

02:19:22.621 --> 02:19:25.757 region:rollup2
UP AND DOWN. THAT IF YOU'RE

02:19:24.256 --> 02:19:27.693 region:rollup2
TRYING TO SUSTAIN A CERTAIN

02:19:25.757 --> 02:19:29.328 region:rollup2
LEVEL FUNDING FOR A PROJECT YOU

02:19:27.693 --> 02:19:30.862 region:rollup2
MAY NEED A RESERVE FOR A PROJECT

02:19:29.328 --> 02:19:32.664 region:rollup2
BUT JUST TO HOLD THE MONEY INTO

02:19:30.862 --> 02:19:33.932 region:rollup2
A POT.

02:19:32.664 --> 02:19:35.834 region:rollup2
AND NOT ACTUALLY HAVE IT

02:19:33.932 --> 02:19:37.035 region:rollup2
ALLOCATED AND I WOULD ARGUE THAT

02:19:35.834 --> 02:19:38.704 region:rollup2
IF THE TENSION THREE YEARS THEN

02:19:37.035 --> 02:19:39.304 region:rollup2
WITHIN THREE YEARS YOU GAIN THE

02:19:38.704 --> 02:19:40.706 region:rollup2

WORKING ON.

02:19:52.417 --> 02:19:56.488 region:rollup2
BUT.

02:19:54.219 --> 02:19:57.356 region:rollup2
PERHAPS MAKE SOME SENSE.

02:19:56.488 --> 02:19:58.557 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF JUST AS THEY'RE

02:19:57.356 --> 02:20:00.659 region:rollup2

PERHAPS SOME WEAKENED PERHAPS WE

02:20:17.809 --> 02:20:21.213 region:rollup2

WHAT YOU'RE PUTTING IN A WAY FOR

02:20:29.154 --> 02:20:32.624 region:rollup2
INSIDIOUS LEVY AND SOME GENERIC

02:20:31.189 --> 02:20:34.326 region:rollup2
ACCOUNT POOL SAYS.

02:20:32.624 --> 02:20:36.295 region:rollup2
PROP SIXTY THREE WHATEVER WE

DECIDE YEARS LATER ON THAT WE

02:20:36.295 --> 02:20:39.598 region:rollup2
WANT TO SPEND IT ON LATER.

02:20:37.896 --> 02:20:42.567 region:rollup2
IT'S THAT SAYING THAT INTENT IS

02:20:39.598 --> 02:20:43.402 region:rollup2
IS THAT SPEND IT DESIGNATED AND

ON.

02:20:47.139 --> 02:20:51.443 region:rollup2
SO BECAUSE HE BROUGHT THAT UP

02:20:49.308 --> 02:20:52.411 region:rollup2
EARLIER YELLS IT AND PUT IT FOR

02:20:51.443 --> 02:20:55.213 region:rollup2

02:20:52.411 --> 02:20:56.515 region:rollup2
GENERICALLY FOR JUST IN A POT.

02:20:55.213 --> 02:20:57.049 region:rollup2
THANK YOU SENATOR PENN HAD TO BE

02:20:56.515 --> 02:20:58.483 region:rollup2
DOING WITH THE COMMISSION.

02:20:57.049 --> 02:21:00.152 region:rollup2
.

02:20:58.483 --> 02:21:01.453 region:rollup2
S. HAS THE SENATOR SAID THE

02:21:00.152 --> 02:21:03.388 region:rollup2
INTENT OF THE ACT WAS TO INFUSE

02:21:01.453 --> 02:21:04.856 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL DOLLARS TO MEET UNMET

02:21:03.388 --> 02:21:06.291 region:rollup2
NEEDS RIGHT AT THE VERY VERY

02:21:04.856 --> 02:21:07.059 region:rollup2
CLEARLY THE INTENT IS TO MAKE

02:21:06.291 --> 02:21:08.827 region:rollup2
FUNDS AVAILABLE TO BE SPENT.

02:21:07.059 --> 02:21:10.228 region:rollup2
RIGHT

02:21:08.827 --> 02:21:11.897 region:rollup2
IT'S ALSO RECOGNITION THAT.

02:21:10.228 --> 02:21:14.232 region:rollup2
.

02:21:11.897 --> 02:21:16.601 region:rollup2
THAT COUNTIES CAN AND SHOULD SET

02:21:14.232 --> 02:21:17.803 region:rollup2

02:21:16.601 --> 02:21:18.370 region:rollup2
TRIED AND SO YOU'RE GETTING AT

02:21:17.803 --> 02:21:20.072 region:rollup2
THE ISSUE OF WHAT'S A PRINT

02:21:18.370 --> 02:21:20.572 region:rollup2
LEVEL.

02:21:20.072 --> 02:21:21.807 region:rollup2
I THINK THE KEY IN THE

02:21:20.572 --> 02:21:23.108 region:rollup2
COMMISSION IS I'M NOT

02:21:21.807 --> 02:21:24.743 region:rollup2
APPROACHING THIS FROM FROM THE

02:21:23.108 --> 02:21:26.178 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE OF WHAT'S THE RIGHT

02:21:24.743 --> 02:21:27.913 region:rollup2
PERCENT TRY THE COMMISSION

02:21:26.178 --> 02:21:28.747 region:rollup2
REALLY FOCUSED ON THIS HAVE. YOU

02:21:27.913 --> 02:21:30.382 region:rollup2
KNOW IS THIS A DECISION THAT

02:21:28.747 --> 02:21:32.150 region:rollup2
COMPETITIVE MUNITY HAS ACTUALLY

02:21:30.382 --> 02:21:33.885 region:rollup2
INFORMED AND MAY RIGHT TO THE

02:21:32.150 --> 02:21:36.355 region:rollup2
EXTENT THAT. THEY TAKE A COUNTY

02:21:33.885 --> 02:21:37.823 region:rollup2
IS DECIDING NOT TO SPEND FUNDS.

02:21:36.355 --> 02:21:39.758 region:rollup2
TO WITH HOLD THEM FOR FUTURE

02:21:37.823 --> 02:21:41.393 region:rollup2
USES IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE

02:21:39.758 --> 02:21:42.761 region:rollup2
PEOPLE ARE DYING IN THE STREETS.

02:21:41.393 --> 02:21:43.862 region:rollup2
THEN RIGHT THEN THAT'S A

02:21:42.761 --> 02:21:45.297 region:rollup2
DECISION THAT THE OTHER THE

02:21:43.862 --> 02:21:46.631 region:rollup2
QUESTION HERE IS WHAT WE'RE

02:21:45.297 --> 02:21:47.299 region:rollup2
REALLY FOCUSING ON THIS FRONT A

02:21:46.631 --> 02:21:48.934 region:rollup2
PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY AND

02:21:47.299 --> 02:21:50.469 region:rollup2
TRANSPARENCY RIGHT AND THERE MAY

02:21:48.934 --> 02:21:52.104 region:rollup2
BE SOME COUNTIES. THAT THROUGH

02:21:50.469 --> 02:21:52.904 region:rollup2
ALL THIS PROCES THEY'VE DECIDED

02:21:52.104 --> 02:21:54.005 region:rollup2
TO MAKE THAT CHOICE I DON'T

02:21:52.904 --> 02:21:55.807 region:rollup2
THINK THAT BE THE CHOICE THAT I

02:21:54.005 --> 02:21:57.209 region:rollup2
WOULD LIKE TO COUNTY TO MAKE.

02:21:55.807 --> 02:21:59.144 region:rollup2
THEM AT BUT WE'VE REALLY TRIED

02:21:57.209 --> 02:22:00.312 region:rollup2
TO FOCUS ON IN SO THE INFORMED

02:21:59.144 --> 02:22:02.681 region:rollup2
CONSENT

02:22:00.312 --> 02:22:03.615 region:rollup2
SIDE OF THE DECISION AROUND WHAT

02:22:02.681 --> 02:22:05.150 region:rollup2
IS PRUDENT FORBES ARE FORGIVEN

02:22:03.615 --> 02:22:06.718 region:rollup2
COUNTY.

02:22:05.150 --> 02:22:07.252 region:rollup2
THE REASON THAT THE WHAT YOU'RE

02:22:06.718 --> 02:22:08.353 region:rollup2
PROPOSING IS ACTUALLY VERY

02:22:07.252 --> 02:22:11.089 region:rollup2
CHALLENGING.

02:22:08.353 --> 02:22:12.891 region:rollup2
IS THAT THE MHS SAY IS ABOUT

02:22:11.089 --> 02:22:14.359 region:rollup2
TWENTY TO THIRTY PERCENT

02:22:12.891 --> 02:22:15.994 region:rollup2
OF OVERALL MENTAL HEALTH FUNDS

02:22:14.359 --> 02:22:17.562 region:rollup2
IN A GIVEN YEAR BUT IN SOME

02:22:15.994 --> 02:22:18.363 region:rollup2
COUNTIES THAT MAKES UP FORTY TWO

02:22:17.562 --> 02:22:20.165 region:rollup2
OR FORTY FIVE OR EVEN FIFTY

02:22:18.363 --> 02:22:20.799 region:rollup2
PERCENT.

02:22:20.165 --> 02:22:22.434 region:rollup2
RIGHT AND THE FUNDS ARE REALLY

02:22:20.799 --> 02:22:23.902 region:rollup2
BLENDED AND SO THERE MAY BE SOME

02:22:22.434 --> 02:22:25.337 region:rollup2
PROJECTS

02:22:23.902 --> 02:22:27.572 region:rollup2
WHERE YOU COULD SET ASIDE A

02:22:25.337 --> 02:22:29.174 region:rollup2
PORTION OF DOLLARS FOR RESERVE.

02:22:27.572 --> 02:22:31.276 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT BECAUSE

02:22:29.174 --> 02:22:33.245 region:rollup2
THE MONEY IS BLENDED TO REALLY

02:22:31.276 --> 02:22:34.679 region:rollup2
TRACK THE DOLLARS SEPARATE FROM

02:22:33.245 --> 02:22:36.615 region:rollup2
YOUR OVERALL SYSTEM WHICH IS WHY

02:22:34.679 --> 02:22:38.884 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT. THE SORT OF THE

02:22:36.615 --> 02:22:39.451 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONAL STRATEGY IS TO IS

02:22:38.884 --> 02:22:41.286 region:rollup2
TO CALL FOR THIS PROBLEM OF

02:22:39.451 --> 02:22:43.422 region:rollup2
RESERVE.

02:22:41.286 --> 02:22:44.956 region:rollup2
BUT I DO WANT TO SUGGEST THAT

02:22:43.422 --> 02:22:46.158 region:rollup2
WHAT HASN'T REALLY BEEN ON THE

02:22:44.956 --> 02:22:48.260 region:rollup2
TABLE IN THE CONVERSATION IS THE

02:22:46.158 --> 02:22:50.295 region:rollup2
OTHER FUNDS.

02:22:48.260 --> 02:22:51.696 region:rollup2
THE FEDERAL SHARE REALIGNMENT

02:22:50.295 --> 02:22:53.265 region:rollup2
THE NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT IN

02:22:51.696 --> 02:22:54.533 region:rollup2
THE TWENTY TWELVE REALIGNMENT

02:22:53.265 --> 02:22:56.902 region:rollup2
RIGHT BECAUSE IT CAN IN IN TERMS

02:22:54.533 --> 02:22:57.936 region:rollup2
OF WHAT IS POTENTIALLY AVAILABLE

02:22:56.902 --> 02:22:59.471 region:rollup2
FOR.

02:22:57.936 --> 02:23:01.173 region:rollup2
MITIGATING DOWNTURNS IN THE

02:22:59.471 --> 02:23:03.175 region:rollup2
ECONOMY RIGHT AND SO WE WERE SO

02:23:01.173 --> 02:23:05.010 region:rollup2
FOCUSED ON THE TWO BILLION

02:23:03.175 --> 02:23:06.912 region:rollup2
DOLLARS THAT IS THE MHSAA MUCH

02:23:05.010 --> 02:23:08.814 region:rollup2
OF THEM AS A RESERVE BE. IT AND

02:23:06.912 --> 02:23:10.649 region:rollup2
SO YOU KNOW I I WANT TO PUT ON

02:23:08.814 --> 02:23:12.818 region:rollup2
THE TABLE WHAT IS PRUDENT IF

02:23:10.649 --> 02:23:15.020 region:rollup2
YOU'RE EXPECTING THE MHS SAY TO

02:23:12.818 --> 02:23:16.121 region:rollup2
TO CUSHION A DOWNTURN IN THE

02:23:15.020 --> 02:23:17.823 region:rollup2
ECONOMY NOT JUST FOR THE IMAGE

02:23:16.121 --> 02:23:20.025 region:rollup2
TO SAY BUT ALSO REALIGNMENT ONE

02:23:17.823 --> 02:23:21.093 region:rollup2
REALIGNMENT TO. AND AND THAT'S

02:23:20.025 --> 02:23:23.462 region:rollup2
YOUR ABILITY TO DROUGHT ON

02:23:21.093 --> 02:23:24.696 region:rollup2
FEDERAL MONEY SO IS IT SO. NINTH

02:23:23.462 --> 02:23:26.364 region:rollup2
I THINK THE CONVERSATION NEEDS

02:23:24.696 --> 02:23:27.632 region:rollup2
TO BE FLESHED OUT A BIT MORE IN

02:23:26.364 --> 02:23:29.434 region:rollup2
TERMS OF THE LARGER PART OF

02:23:27.632 --> 02:23:30.702 region:rollup2
FUNDS THESE ROUGHLY SEVEN

02:23:29.434 --> 02:23:32.037 region:rollup2
BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR THAT IS

02:23:30.702 --> 02:23:34.339 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE FOR MENTAL HEALTH NOT

02:23:32.037 --> 02:23:38.410 region:rollup2
JUST THE TWO. THAT IS MHSAA AND

02:23:34.339 --> 02:23:39.411 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZE THAT THE WAY IN WHICH

02:23:38.410 --> 02:23:41.012 region:rollup2
THE FUNDING FUNDING IS USED.

02:23:39.411 --> 02:23:41.913 region:rollup2
IT'S RARELY THAT THIS PROGRAM

02:23:41.012 --> 02:23:43.715 region:rollup2
ISN'T MUCH TO SAY FUNDED AND

02:23:41.913 --> 02:23:44.549 region:rollup2
THESE ONES ARE NOT.

02:23:43.715 --> 02:23:47.519 region:rollup2
TYPICALLY IT'S THESE OF THE

02:23:44.549 --> 02:23:48.153 region:rollup2
DOLLARS AND AS YOU HEARD MANY

02:23:47.519 --> 02:23:50.021 region:rollup2
THE COUNTIES ARE STRUGGLING TO

02:23:48.153 --> 02:23:51.523 region:rollup2
SAY. I'M YOU KNOW WHAT CAN I

02:23:50.021 --> 02:23:53.291 region:rollup2
BUILD FOR AND THAT THAT'S WHAT I

02:23:51.523 --> 02:23:54.459 region:rollup2
WANT TO OFFER VERSES WHAT PEOPLE

02:23:53.291 --> 02:23:55.894 region:rollup2
NEED.

02:23:54.459 --> 02:23:57.429 region:rollup2
AND HAD A WIDE AND HOW THE WHITE

02:23:55.894 --> 02:23:59.164 region:rollup2
DESIGN MY SYSTEM TO RESPOND TO

02:23:57.429 --> 02:24:00.565 region:rollup2
PEOPLE'S NEEDS ARE AND THEN

02:23:59.164 --> 02:24:01.900 region:rollup2
FULLY LEVERAGE ALL OF THE

02:24:00.565 --> 02:24:02.400 region:rollup2
FUNDING STREAMS IN ORDER TO

02:24:01.900 --> 02:24:05.303 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THAT NEED BASED

02:24:02.400 --> 02:24:06.104 region:rollup2
STRATEGY.

02:24:05.303 --> 02:24:08.540 region:rollup2
WHEN.

02:24:06.104 --> 02:24:10.609 region:rollup2
I MEAN.

02:24:08.540 --> 02:24:11.843 region:rollup2
TOBY SAID IT REALLY WELL I THINK

02:24:10.609 --> 02:24:12.177 region:rollup2
THE ONLY OTHER THING THAT WE

02:24:11.843 --> 02:24:13.979 region:rollup2
WOULD SAY IS.

02:24:12.177 --> 02:24:14.846 region:rollup2
.

02:24:13.979 --> 02:24:17.516 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW LEGISLATURE'S.

02:24:14.846 --> 02:24:20.085 region:rollup2
AT LEAST TWO IF NOT THREE TIMES

02:24:17.516 --> 02:24:22.187 region:rollup2
HAS MODIFIED THE INITIATIVE. SO

02:24:20.085 --> 02:24:24.055 region:rollup2
TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU.

02:24:22.187 --> 02:24:25.924 region:rollup2
TO THE CA.GOV SO YOU BUT THE

02:24:24.055 --> 02:24:27.158 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE WANTED TO HAVE A

02:24:25.924 --> 02:24:29.294 region:rollup2
MORE DELIBERATE.

02:24:27.158 --> 02:24:31.830 region:rollup2
.

02:24:29.294 --> 02:24:33.431 region:rollup2
DIRECTIVE TO THE COUNTIES ON

02:24:31.830 --> 02:24:36.234 region:rollup2
EITHER THE USE OF THE FUNDS ARE

02:24:33.431 --> 02:24:37.569 region:rollup2
THE RESERVE AND THAT IS NOT

02:24:36.234 --> 02:24:39.037 region:rollup2
OTHERWISE EITHER CONTEMPLATED

02:24:37.569 --> 02:24:40.739 region:rollup2
CONTEMPLATED OR SPECIFIED BY THE

02:24:39.037 --> 02:24:42.941 region:rollup2
INITIATIVE. HE WOULD JUST HAVE

02:24:40.739 --> 02:24:44.209 region:rollup2
TO WORK THROUGH THE PROCESS BY

02:24:42.941 --> 02:24:44.809 region:rollup2
WHICH THE INITIATIVE WHAT AT YOU

02:24:44.209 --> 02:24:46.444 region:rollup2
KNOW LAID OUT IN TERMS OF TWO

02:24:44.809 --> 02:24:48.313 region:rollup2
THIRDS VOTE IN FURTHERANCE OF

02:24:46.444 --> 02:24:50.448 region:rollup2
THE ACT. I'M SO WERE ALSO ALWAYS

02:24:48.313 --> 02:24:52.817 region:rollup2
MINDFUL OF YOU KNOW I'M GETTING

02:24:50.448 --> 02:24:53.418 region:rollup2
BACK TO MY. COMMENTS TO SENATOR

02:24:52.817 --> 02:24:56.021 region:rollup2
MORLOCK IS.

02:24:53.418 --> 02:24:57.923 region:rollup2
WE WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE

02:24:56.021 --> 02:25:00.458 region:rollup2
THAT WE DON'T OTHERWISE AND

02:24:57.923 --> 02:25:02.093 region:rollup2
DECIDED IT THEY ENACT THE ACT

02:25:00.458 --> 02:25:04.429 region:rollup2
WOULD NOT OTHERWISE.

02:25:02.093 --> 02:25:05.797 region:rollup2
BE ALLOWED FOR WELL I THINK GO

02:25:04.429 --> 02:25:07.499 region:rollup2
FIRST OF ALL I APPRECIATE THE US

02:25:05.797 --> 02:25:08.800 region:rollup2
ARE BELLS.

02:25:07.499 --> 02:25:09.968 region:rollup2
A HISTORY AND I THINK WE WANT

02:25:08.800 --> 02:25:11.970 region:rollup2
TRADE RESPECT WHAT THE VOTERS

02:25:09.968 --> 02:25:14.673 region:rollup2
VOTED FOR.

02:25:11.970 --> 02:25:16.708 region:rollup2
AT THAT AND I THINK THE OTHER

02:25:14.673 --> 02:25:18.343 region:rollup2
PART THOUGH IS THAT.

02:25:16.708 --> 02:25:19.477 region:rollup2
I THINK PART OF RELEASED AND

02:25:18.343 --> 02:25:20.645 region:rollup2
ANNOUNCED THEIR MORE LIKE ISN'T

02:25:19.477 --> 02:25:22.847 region:rollup2
HERE AT THE MOMENT.

02:25:20.645 --> 02:25:25.250 region:rollup2
UP BUT I THINK THAT THE

02:25:22.847 --> 02:25:27.519 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES IS THAT.

02:25:25.250 --> 02:25:28.687 region:rollup2
WHEN A COUNTY THE SITES NOT TO

02:25:27.519 --> 02:25:30.355 region:rollup2
SPEND SOME OF THE MONEY AND PUT

02:25:28.687 --> 02:25:31.089 region:rollup2
IT AWAY SOMEWHERE IT'S NOT

02:25:30.355 --> 02:25:33.191 region:rollup2
MISLEAD THE MOST PUBLIC OF

02:25:31.089 --> 02:25:34.626 region:rollup2
DECISIONS AND NOT MISS A DEFAULT

02:25:33.191 --> 02:25:35.794 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW PEOPLE MAY NOT JUST BE

02:25:34.626 --> 02:25:37.395 region:rollup2
PAYING ATTENTION TO IT BUT THEN

02:25:35.794 --> 02:25:38.463 region:rollup2
WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT WE HAVE THE

02:25:37.395 --> 02:25:39.631 region:rollup2
RACE. SITUATION WE HAVE NOW

02:25:38.463 --> 02:25:42.033 region:rollup2
WHERE PEOPLE TURN AROUND SAID

02:25:39.631 --> 02:25:43.435 region:rollup2
LOOK AT ALL THE MONEY YOU HAVE.

02:25:42.033 --> 02:25:45.303 region:rollup2
AND I'M LOOKING AROUND THE ROOM

02:25:43.435 --> 02:25:47.539 region:rollup2
AND HEALTH ISSUES AND WHY ISN'T

02:25:45.303 --> 02:25:49.240 region:rollup2
BEING SPENT RIGHT. AND.

02:25:47.539 --> 02:25:50.342 region:rollup2
THAT AND THAT THAT'S THE REASON

02:25:49.240 --> 02:25:51.476 region:rollup2
FOR TREATING THE REVERSION

02:25:50.342 --> 02:25:53.645 region:rollup2
PROCESS

02:25:51.476 --> 02:25:55.046 region:rollup2
AND INITIAL INITIATIVE BECAUSE I

02:25:53.645 --> 02:25:56.314 region:rollup2
THINK THE AUTHORS WHEN THEY PUT

02:25:55.046 --> 02:25:58.216 region:rollup2
TOGETHER.

02:25:56.314 --> 02:25:59.517 region:rollup2
RIGHT BREAK CONCERNED ABOUT

02:25:58.216 --> 02:26:00.719 region:rollup2
THAT'S BASED ON WHAT THEIR BELL

02:25:59.517 --> 02:26:03.521 region:rollup2
SAID SO I WASN'T THERE.

02:26:00.719 --> 02:26:05.757 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK IT DOES PRESENT. A

02:26:03.521 --> 02:26:07.926 region:rollup2
LARGE CHALLENGE WHEN. BASICALLY

02:26:05.757 --> 02:26:09.127 region:rollup2
IF YOU HAVE A POT OF MONEY IN

02:26:07.926 --> 02:26:10.395 region:rollup2
EXCESS OF ON THE FIRST FIVE

02:26:09.127 --> 02:26:12.163 region:rollup2
COMMISSIONER SOME.

02:26:10.395 --> 02:26:13.632 region:rollup2
ISSUES AND I ACTUALLY ARE

02:26:12.163 --> 02:26:15.600 region:rollup2
COMMISSION I ACTUALLY SAID WE

02:26:13.632 --> 02:26:17.602 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY HAD A DESIGNATED.

02:26:15.600 --> 02:26:18.270 region:rollup2
SO AND EVEN THEN PEOPLE STILL

02:26:17.602 --> 02:26:20.338 region:rollup2
SAID LUCKY SOD THIS MONEY YOU'RE

02:26:18.270 --> 02:26:21.439 region:rollup2
SITTING ON AND THE PROBLEM IS IS

02:26:20.338 --> 02:26:22.574 region:rollup2
THAT THE MONEY'S JUST.

02:26:21.439 --> 02:26:23.608 region:rollup2
SITTING THERE ARE KNOW I KNOW

02:26:22.574 --> 02:26:25.010 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT JUST SITTING THERE

02:26:23.608 --> 02:26:27.212 region:rollup2
PEOPLE ARE THINKING ABOUT

02:26:25.010 --> 02:26:29.381 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT THINGS BUT IT'S NOT.

02:26:27.212 --> 02:26:30.482 region:rollup2
BEING YELP IF IF THERE ISN'T

02:26:29.381 --> 02:26:31.750 region:rollup2
LIKE THIS IS THE PLAN WE HALF

02:26:30.482 --> 02:26:32.851 region:rollup2
FOR THAT RIGHT WE NEED A CERTAIN

02:26:31.750 --> 02:26:34.452 region:rollup2
AMOUNT BECAUSE WE'RE DOING SOME

02:26:32.851 --> 02:26:36.521 region:rollup2
CAPITAL THING WE HAVE A CERTAIN

02:26:34.452 --> 02:26:38.657 region:rollup2
AMOUNT BUT. BASICALLY IT'S

02:26:36.521 --> 02:26:40.458 region:rollup2
NOT DESIGNATED.

02:26:38.657 --> 02:26:41.593 region:rollup2
I THINK AND IT STARTS GETTING

02:26:40.458 --> 02:26:42.861 region:rollup2
OLDER AND OLDER AND THAT'S WHAT

02:26:41.593 --> 02:26:44.262 region:rollup2
WE HEARD TO ANY GETS HARDER HARD

02:26:42.861 --> 02:26:45.563 region:rollup2
TO TRACK WHAT'S HAPPENING TO IT.

02:26:44.262 --> 02:26:46.931 region:rollup2
THEN I THINK YOU LOSE PUBLIC

02:26:45.563 --> 02:26:49.367 region:rollup2
CONFIDENCE AND I THINK THAT'S

02:26:46.931 --> 02:26:50.268 region:rollup2
THE THING.

02:26:49.367 --> 02:26:50.935 region:rollup2
SOME OF A SERVE BOTH STRAIGHT UP

02:26:50.268 --> 02:26:52.837 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE KNOW HOW IMPORTANT IS

02:26:50.935 --> 02:26:53.938 region:rollup2
ACT IS AND WHY IT'S FUNDING SO

02:26:52.837 --> 02:26:55.473 region:rollup2
WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE A LOSS OF

02:26:53.938 --> 02:26:57.242 region:rollup2
PUBLIC CONFIDENCE AND.

02:26:55.473 --> 02:26:58.810 region:rollup2
AND IN THIS ACT AND THAT IT'S

02:26:57.242 --> 02:27:01.212 region:rollup2
BEEN FOURTEEN YEARS AND.

02:26:58.810 --> 02:27:03.048 region:rollup2
ISSUES DO COME UP ABOUT AND WHEN

02:27:01.212 --> 02:27:04.849 region:rollup2
PEOPLE GO WILL LOOK THIS MONEY.

02:27:03.048 --> 02:27:05.417 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT BEING SPENT IT WE HAVE

02:27:04.849 --> 02:27:05.583 region:rollup2
THESE NEEDS WARY SITTING OUT

02:27:05.417 --> 02:27:14.225 region:rollup2
FOR.

02:27:05.583 --> 02:27:15.260 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:27:14.225 --> 02:27:17.996 region:rollup2
THINK YOU.

02:27:15.260 --> 02:27:19.597 region:rollup2
AYE AT SIT ON THE.

02:27:17.996 --> 02:27:20.899 region:rollup2
HEALTH AND HUMAN HELP SOMEONE

02:27:19.597 --> 02:27:22.801 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE AND.

02:27:20.899 --> 02:27:24.369 region:rollup2
WE'VE BEEN GOING THROUGH MANY

02:27:22.801 --> 02:27:25.637 region:rollup2
HEARINGS AND THIS IS THE SAME

02:27:24.369 --> 02:27:26.838 region:rollup2
THING I KEEP HEARING OVER AND

02:27:25.637 --> 02:27:29.240 region:rollup2
OVER AGAIN IF IT'S NOT ONE.

02:27:26.838 --> 02:27:30.842 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT IT'S ARE NOT ONE.

02:27:29.240 --> 02:27:33.011 region:rollup2
ACT THAT'S ANOTHER ACT AND IT'S

02:27:30.842 --> 02:27:33.578 region:rollup2
JUST REALLY FRUSTRATING FOR ME

02:27:33.011 --> 02:27:35.513 region:rollup2
TO SEE THAT.

02:27:33.578 --> 02:27:37.115 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE COMMENTS LIKE

02:27:35.513 --> 02:27:38.383 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT MISUSING THE MONEY NOT

02:27:37.115 --> 02:27:39.751 region:rollup2
USING THE MONEY IS JUST AS BAD

02:27:38.383 --> 02:27:41.519 region:rollup2
AS MISUSING THE MONEY IN MY

02:27:39.751 --> 02:27:43.021 region:rollup2
OPINION BECAUSE WE HAVE PEOPLE.

WE CAN DISPUTE THE THE

02:27:49.828 --> 02:27:53.364 region:rollup2
AUDITOR'S

A. REPORT WE CAN DISAGREE WITH

02:27:53.364 --> 02:27:56.434 region:rollup2
THAT BUT THE OF THE FACT THAT

02:27:54.999 --> 02:27:57.902 region:rollup2
NOBODY'S TALKING ABOUT THE FOLKS

02:27:56.434 --> 02:28:00.171 region:rollup2
THAT ARE BEING ARE NOT BEING

02:27:57.902 --> 02:28:01.473 region:rollup2
SERVICED THAT'S MY FRUSTRATION.

02:28:00.171 --> 02:28:02.874 region:rollup2
BAD WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT

02:28:01.473 --> 02:28:04.442 region:rollup2
TECHNICALITIES HERE AND THERE

02:28:02.874 --> 02:28:06.044 region:rollup2
WHERE'S THE HUMAN FACTOR IN THIS

02:28:04.442 --> 02:28:06.945 region:rollup2
AND I SAID THE LAST WEEK AND.

02:28:06.044 --> 02:28:07.212 region:rollup2
I'VE BEEN SITTING THROUGH

02:28:06.945 --> 02:28:08.780 region:rollup2
THROUGH.

02:28:07.212 --> 02:28:10.915 region:rollup2
TWICE A WEEK COMMITTEE MEETINGS

02:28:08.780 --> 02:28:12.484 region:rollup2
AND IT'S THE SAME STORY IF IT'S

02:28:10.915 --> 02:28:12.884 region:rollup2
NOT THIS ISSUE WITH ANOTHER

02:28:12.484 --> 02:28:14.486 region:rollup2
ISSUE AND IT'S.

02:28:12.884 --> 02:28:15.754 region:rollup2
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT STRATEGIC

02:28:14.486 --> 02:28:17.655 region:rollup2
PLANS IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE WE

02:28:15.754 --> 02:28:20.225 region:rollup2
HAVE A ANY STRATEGIC PLANS FOR

02:28:17.655 --> 02:28:22.193 region:rollup2
ANYTHING AND THIS IS BASED ON ME

02:28:20.225 --> 02:28:23.895 region:rollup2
SITTING HERE THIS YEAR AND LAST

02:28:22.193 --> 02:28:26.831 region:rollup2
YEAR. THE FRUSTRATION AGAIN

02:28:23.895 --> 02:28:28.366 region:rollup2
COMES FROM THE INABILITY TO SEE

02:28:26.831 --> 02:28:29.701 region:rollup2
THE HUMAN FACTOR IN THIS.

02:28:28.366 --> 02:28:31.102 region:rollup2
AGAIN WE CAN DISPUTE THE MONEY

02:28:29.701 --> 02:28:33.405 region:rollup2
ALL WE WANT BUT THERE IS NO

02:28:31.102 --> 02:28:34.773 region:rollup2
NOBODY THINKING.

02:28:33.405 --> 02:28:37.375 region:rollup2
GOD THERE'S PEOPLE DYING.

02:28:34.773 --> 02:28:38.977 region:rollup2
AND WE'RE NOT HELPING THEM.

02:28:37.375 --> 02:28:39.544 region:rollup2
MISS USING THE MONEY IS NOT IT'S

02:28:38.977 --> 02:28:40.945 region:rollup2
NOT.

02:28:39.544 --> 02:28:42.714 region:rollup2
THE QUESTION IS NOT USING THE

02:28:40.945 --> 02:28:44.149 region:rollup2
MONEY AND THAT FOR ME IS JUST AS

02:28:42.714 --> 02:28:45.316 region:rollup2
BAD BECAUSE WE DO HAVE PEOPLE

02:28:44.149 --> 02:28:47.552 region:rollup2
DYING ON THE STREETS AND THEN WE

02:28:45.316 --> 02:28:50.622 region:rollup2

HAVE HOW MANY MENTALLY ILL FOLKS

02:28:52.524 --> 02:28:55.260 region:rollup2
WE HAVE AND WE HAVE TO DO

02:28:53.958 --> 02:28:56.694 region:rollup2
SOMETHING ABOUT IT AND THEN WE

02:28:55.260 --> 02:28:58.630 region:rollup2
HAVE A POT OF MONEY THAT'S NOT

02:28:56.694 --> 02:28:59.898 region:rollup2
BEING USED? FOR DOING SOMETHING

02:28:58.630 --> 02:29:01.466 region:rollup2
ABOUT IT AND.

02:28:59.898 --> 02:29:03.034 region:rollup2
TO YOUR POINT ABOUT THE PUBLIC

02:29:01.466 --> 02:29:05.069 region:rollup2

DEPARTMENTS.

02:29:08.173 --> 02:29:11.543 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I KEEP GETTING

02:29:09.207 --> 02:29:13.278 region:rollup2
MISINFORMATION I KEEP GETTING.

02:29:11.543 --> 02:29:15.146 region:rollup2
THE RUNAROUND WHEN I ASK

02:29:13.278 --> 02:29:17.348 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS AND THEN NOW THAT.

02:29:17.348 --> 02:29:21.219 region:rollup2
DISPUTE WITH THE AUDIT AND SO AT

02:29:19.451 --> 02:29:22.420 region:rollup2
SOME POINT WHERE THE HUMAN

02:29:21.219 --> 02:29:24.022 region:rollup2

THAT OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE

02:33:18.556 --> 02:33:22.860 region:rollup2
HAVE A RESERVE OF THREE PERCENT.

02:33:22.293 --> 02:33:25.863 region:rollup2
AND.

02:33:22.860 --> 02:33:27.999 region:rollup2
IN ON THE ARGUMENT THAT.

02:33:25.863 --> 02:33:32.070 region:rollup2
THAT THEIR MONEY IS THERE TO BE

02:33:27.999 --> 02:33:34.038 region:rollup2

DESPERATE FOR HELP.

OF THE ENTIRE STATE BUDGET IS

02:34:31.262 --> 02:34:35.166 region:rollup2
OVERLY RELIANT ON.

02:34:32.930 --> 02:34:36.501 region:rollup2
THE TOP ONE PERCENT OF.

02:34:35.166 --> 02:34:38.236 region:rollup2

SUBJECT TO THEFT FLUCTUATION IS

02:34:40.037 --> 02:34:43.508 region:rollup2
THERE SOMETHING UNIQUE ABOUT.

THEM UP ABOUT.

02:34:43.508 --> 02:34:46.511 region:rollup2
THE MENTAL HEALTH.

THAT.

02:34:46.711 --> 02:34:50.081 region:rollup2
.

02:34:48.513 --> 02:34:53.117 region:rollup2
THAT REQUIRE THIS MUCH HIGHER

02:34:50.081 --> 02:34:54.318 region:rollup2
RESERVE.

02:34:53.117 --> 02:34:57.121 region:rollup2
I AM I THINK YOU KNOW SO MY

02:34:54.318 --> 02:34:58.890 region:rollup2
COMMENTS WERE AND.

02:34:57.121 --> 02:35:00.525 region:rollup2
PREDICATED ON MY.

02:34:58.890 --> 02:35:02.960 region:rollup2
HISTORY AND THE HEALTH AND HUMAN

02:35:00.525 --> 02:35:05.429 region:rollup2
SERVICES AREA SO.

02:35:02.960 --> 02:35:07.031 region:rollup2
AYE WORKS I.

02:35:05.429 --> 02:35:08.332 region:rollup2
WITHIN THE STATE AND THAT BOTH

02:35:07.031 --> 02:35:09.534 region:rollup2
AGENCY IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE

02:35:08.332 --> 02:35:11.469 region:rollup2
THAT THE RECESSION.

02:35:09.534 --> 02:35:12.904 region:rollup2
GENERAL FUND DEPARTMENTS THAT

02:35:11.469 --> 02:35:15.006 region:rollup2
ERROR HOLY WRIT.

02:35:12.904 --> 02:35:15.673 region:rollup2
RELIANT ON GENERAL FUND SUCH AS

02:35:15.006 --> 02:35:17.208 region:rollup2
OURS.

02:35:15.673 --> 02:35:19.677 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY.

02:35:17.208 --> 02:35:20.545 region:rollup2
I I KNOW THAT EDUCATION SUFFERS

02:35:19.677 --> 02:35:22.046 region:rollup2
WHEN THERE'S A DOWNTURN IN THE

02:35:20.545 --> 02:35:24.348 region:rollup2
ECONOMY. UNDER THE.

02:35:22.046 --> 02:35:24.816 region:rollup2
PROP NINETY EIGHT AND THE

02:35:24.348 --> 02:35:26.184 region:rollup2
GUARANTEE IT IS A MUCH

02:35:24.816 --> 02:35:28.619 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT.

02:35:26.184 --> 02:35:29.987 region:rollup2
OF WORLD THAT EDUCATION LIVES

02:35:28.619 --> 02:35:32.857 region:rollup2
AND THEN HEALTH AND HUMAN

02:35:29.987 --> 02:35:33.591 region:rollup2
SERVICES I THINK.

02:35:32.857 --> 02:35:34.158 region:rollup2
ON I'D I'D LOST TRACK OF HOW

02:35:33.591 --> 02:35:35.860 region:rollup2
MANY BILLIONS.

02:35:34.158 --> 02:35:36.961 region:rollup2
THAT WE CUT FROM THE OVERALL

02:35:35.860 --> 02:35:38.796 region:rollup2
HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES BUDGET

02:35:36.961 --> 02:35:39.096 region:rollup2
SO I THINK MY COMMENTS.

02:35:38.796 --> 02:35:41.199 region:rollup2
ARE ALWAYS.

02:35:39.096 --> 02:35:42.733 region:rollup2
.

02:35:41.199 --> 02:35:44.302 region:rollup2
HEARKENING BACK TO THE DAYS IN

02:35:42.733 --> 02:35:46.003 region:rollup2
WHICH WE HAD TO MAKE REALLY

02:35:44.302 --> 02:35:47.572 region:rollup2
TERRIBLE POLICY DECISIONS.

02:35:46.003 --> 02:35:49.540 region:rollup2
AROUND SERVICES THAT WE WERE

02:35:47.572 --> 02:35:50.908 region:rollup2
CUTTING BENEFITS THAT WE WERE

02:35:49.540 --> 02:35:53.511 region:rollup2
REMOVING RATES THAT WE WERE

02:35:50.908 --> 02:35:53.778 region:rollup2
REDUCE. ON POPULATIONS THAT WE

02:35:53.511 --> 02:35:55.313 region:rollup2
WERE NOT.

02:35:53.778 --> 02:35:56.647 region:rollup2
.

02:35:55.313 --> 02:35:59.183 region:rollup2
DETERMINING ELIGIBLE FOR

02:35:56.647 --> 02:35:59.517 region:rollup2
SERVICES AND SO I THINK MY

02:35:59.183 --> 02:36:01.152 region:rollup2
COMMENTS AND.

02:35:59.517 --> 02:36:02.453 region:rollup2
.

02:36:01.152 --> 02:36:04.121 region:rollup2
REALLY SENSITIVITY AROUND THE

02:36:02.453 --> 02:36:05.890 region:rollup2
VOLATILITY OF THE REVENUES IS

02:36:04.121 --> 02:36:07.124 region:rollup2
REALLY PREDICATED ON DOT.

02:36:05.890 --> 02:36:09.026 region:rollup2
BOTH THE HARM.

02:36:07.124 --> 02:36:10.862 region:rollup2
AND THIS THE WAY THAT THE STATE

02:36:09.026 --> 02:36:11.896 region:rollup2
HAS REALLY RIGHTED ITSELF IN

02:36:10.862 --> 02:36:13.764 region:rollup2
TERMS OF ITS FISCAL

02:36:11.896 --> 02:36:15.132 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY AND IT'S YOU KNOW

02:36:13.764 --> 02:36:16.801 region:rollup2
IT'S QUITE SOMETHING TO SIT IN A

02:36:15.132 --> 02:36:18.202 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT. NOW THAT WE SERVE A

02:36:16.801 --> 02:36:21.038 region:rollup2
THIRD OF THE CALIFORNIANS.

02:36:18.202 --> 02:36:22.807 region:rollup2
AND MEDI CAL WE OVERSEE YOU

02:36:21.038 --> 02:36:24.342 region:rollup2
KNOW A SIGNIFICANT GENERAL FUND

02:36:22.807 --> 02:36:25.543 region:rollup2
BUDGET BUT I THINK WERE ALSO

02:36:24.342 --> 02:36:27.445 region:rollup2
VERY MINDFUL AND I KNOW.

02:36:25.543 --> 02:36:29.513 region:rollup2
THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS AS A

02:36:27.445 --> 02:36:30.681 region:rollup2
WHOLE THAT THE ECONOMY CHANGES

02:36:29.513 --> 02:36:31.849 region:rollup2
AND THAT USUALLY HEALTH AND

02:36:30.681 --> 02:36:33.251 region:rollup2
HUMAN SERVICES ON ONE OF THE

02:36:31.849 --> 02:36:35.019 region:rollup2
FIRST.

02:36:33.251 --> 02:36:36.821 region:rollup2
AREAS IN WHICH THERE'S BUDGET

02:36:35.019 --> 02:36:37.755 region:rollup2
REDUCTIONS AND SO I THINK OUR

02:36:36.821 --> 02:36:39.423 region:rollup2
RESERVE.

02:36:37.755 --> 02:36:40.858 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTS ARE ARE RESERVE

02:36:39.423 --> 02:36:41.792 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATION AND WHY IT'S

02:36:40.858 --> 02:36:43.895 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT.

02:36:41.792 --> 02:36:45.029 region:rollup2
WE WERE TO TRYING TO ACCOUNT

02:36:43.895 --> 02:36:46.130 region:rollup2
FOR BOTH EXPENDITURES IN

02:36:45.029 --> 02:36:47.832 region:rollup2
INFLATION.

02:36:46.130 --> 02:36:48.933 region:rollup2
IN WHICH I'M NOT SURE

02:36:47.832 --> 02:36:51.702 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY THAT THAT WAS.

02:36:48.933 --> 02:36:54.005 region:rollup2
EITHER CONTEMPLATED OR ARE PART

02:36:51.702 --> 02:36:56.307 region:rollup2
OF THE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATION

02:36:54.005 --> 02:36:56.707 region:rollup2
I THINK ALSO AND I WANTED TO

02:36:56.307 --> 02:36:57.708 region:rollup2
MAKE A FINE POINT.

02:36:56.707 --> 02:36:59.944 region:rollup2
.

02:36:57.708 --> 02:37:01.679 region:rollup2
THIS IS NOT WERE NOT SEEN SIXTY

02:36:59.944 --> 02:37:03.180 region:rollup2
FOUR TO EIGHTY EIGHT PERCENT OR

02:37:01.679 --> 02:37:05.516 region:rollup2
WHATEVER THE SIXTY TO EIGHTY

02:37:03.180 --> 02:37:06.584 region:rollup2
PERCENT. THAT'S NOT ON AN ANNUAL

02:37:05.516 --> 02:37:08.919 region:rollup2
BASIS THAT YOU CAN SET THAT

02:37:06.584 --> 02:37:09.453 region:rollup2
ABOUT A SITE IT IS A CAPS.

02:37:08.919 --> 02:37:11.322 region:rollup2
RESERVE RIGHT SO LIKE IN

02:37:09.453 --> 02:37:12.123 region:rollup2
EDUCATION

02:37:11.322 --> 02:37:13.124 region:rollup2
RIGHT SIDES WANTED TO MAKE SURE

02:37:12.123 --> 02:37:15.092 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I THINK.

02:37:13.124 --> 02:37:16.260 region:rollup2
SENATOR BILL WAS KIND OF GOING

02:37:15.092 --> 02:37:17.762 region:rollup2
DOWN IT MADE IT SOUND LIKE YOU

02:37:16.260 --> 02:37:19.263 region:rollup2
COULD TAKE YOU KNOW THIRTY THREE

02:37:17.762 --> 02:37:20.131 region:rollup2
PERCENT SET ASIDE AND THEN TAKE

02:37:19.263 --> 02:37:21.565 region:rollup2
THE NEXT THIRTY THREE PERCENT

02:37:20.131 --> 02:37:23.434 region:rollup2
SET ASIDE AND THAT'S NOT WHAT WE

02:37:21.565 --> 02:37:26.103 region:rollup2
ARE PROPOSING WHERE ST. USUAL

02:37:23.434 --> 02:37:27.772 region:rollup2
HAVE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN SIXTY SIX

02:37:26.103 --> 02:37:29.407 region:rollup2
AND EIGHTY FOUR PERCENT OF YOUR

02:37:27.772 --> 02:37:30.641 region:rollup2
ANNUAL ALLOCATION SET ASIDE AS

02:37:29.407 --> 02:37:32.877 region:rollup2
YOUR MOCKS.

02:37:30.641 --> 02:37:34.111 region:rollup2
PRUDENT RESERVE AND TRYING TO

02:37:32.877 --> 02:37:35.546 region:rollup2
ACCOUNT FOR THE FACT THAT THAT

02:37:34.111 --> 02:37:36.347 region:rollup2
TAKING INTO ACCOUNT EXPENDITURES

02:37:35.546 --> 02:37:37.949 region:rollup2
FOR SERVICES AS WELL AS

02:37:36.347 --> 02:37:38.983 region:rollup2
INFLATION.

02:37:37.949 --> 02:37:41.686 region:rollup2
SO THAT WAS THAT WAS HOW WE CAME

02:37:38.983 --> 02:37:43.020 region:rollup2
TO THAT NUMBER.

02:37:41.686 --> 02:37:45.289 region:rollup2
STILL YET A MAIN EXPENSE

02:37:43.020 --> 02:37:47.258 region:rollup2
EXPENDITURES INFLATION AMEND

02:37:45.289 --> 02:37:49.427 region:rollup2
THOSE APPLY TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS

02:37:47.258 --> 02:37:51.562 region:rollup2
ALSO AND SO I I FAILED TO.

02:37:49.427 --> 02:37:52.897 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND.

02:37:51.562 --> 02:37:55.066 region:rollup2
WHAT IS FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT

02:37:52.897 --> 02:37:57.568 region:rollup2
WITH MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES?

02:37:55.066 --> 02:37:59.303 region:rollup2
AS A AS AS COMPARED TO TWO

02:37:57.568 --> 02:38:00.171 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS AMENDED.

02:37:59.303 --> 02:38:01.472 region:rollup2
WHAT I'M HEARING IS THAT?

02:38:00.171 --> 02:38:04.642 region:rollup2
IT'S

02:38:01.472 --> 02:38:07.611 region:rollup2
BETTER.

02:38:04.642 --> 02:38:09.413 region:rollup2
TO TO TO NOT PROVIDE SERVICES

02:38:07.611 --> 02:38:11.415 region:rollup2
WITH THE DOLLARS THAT WE HAVE

02:38:09.413 --> 02:38:14.085 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE HERE TODAY. RATHER

02:38:11.415 --> 02:38:16.887 region:rollup2
THAN RISK HAVING TO CUT IT OFF

02:38:14.085 --> 02:38:18.456 region:rollup2
NEXT YEAR OR OR AND IN IN IN IN

02:38:16.887 --> 02:38:20.725 region:rollup2
TIMES OF A BUDGET DOWNTURN.

02:38:18.456 --> 02:38:23.561 region:rollup2
AND AYE I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT

02:38:20.725 --> 02:38:25.529 region:rollup2
I IT SEEMS TO ME THAT. THE DAY

02:38:23.561 --> 02:38:28.432 region:rollup2
THAT DESPERATE NEED IS HERE AND

02:38:25.529 --> 02:38:29.934 region:rollup2
NOW AND I UNDERSTAND WHY. WE'RE

02:38:28.432 --> 02:38:31.902 region:rollup2
NOT.

02:38:29.934 --> 02:38:34.872 region:rollup2
SPENDING THAT MONEY NOW.

02:38:31.902 --> 02:38:35.539 region:rollup2
.

02:38:34.872 --> 02:38:36.540 region:rollup2
I DON'T THINK I KNOW IT THAT I

02:38:35.539 --> 02:38:38.008 region:rollup2
DON'T THINK THAT WE'RE SAYING

02:38:36.540 --> 02:38:39.477 region:rollup2
THAT WE WANT THE COUNTIES TO SIT

02:38:38.008 --> 02:38:41.212 region:rollup2
AND NOT SPEND THE MONEY I THINK

02:38:39.477 --> 02:38:43.114 region:rollup2
THAT WE.

02:38:41.212 --> 02:38:45.116 region:rollup2
A AS I KIND OF MENTION IN THE

02:38:43.114 --> 02:38:46.283 region:rollup2
TOP OF MY COMMENTS SAID THE

02:38:45.116 --> 02:38:48.219 region:rollup2
EIGHTY PERCENT OF THAT

02:38:46.283 --> 02:38:50.154 region:rollup2
ALLOCATION FOR THAT'S THE

02:38:48.219 --> 02:38:51.455 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY SERVICES AND SUPPORTS.

02:38:50.154 --> 02:38:52.957 region:rollup2
THE COUNTIES ARE SPENDING THAT

02:38:51.455 --> 02:38:54.058 region:rollup2
YES SO WHERE WORD WE'RE LOOKING

02:38:52.957 --> 02:38:55.626 region:rollup2
AT FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE

02:38:54.058 --> 02:38:57.161 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS THAT WE'RE NOT

02:38:55.626 --> 02:38:57.762 region:rollup2
SPENT.

02:38:57.161 --> 02:38:59.096 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE FIFTY SIX COUNTIES
