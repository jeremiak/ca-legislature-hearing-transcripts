THROUGHOUT THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC FAIRGROUNDS HAVE ALSO BEEN A CENTRAL EXPANDING VACCINE AND TESTING SITES FOR GROUNDS HAVE ALSO BEEN USED TO SHELTER THE HOMELESS AND HOUSE MIGRANT CHILDREN. THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS HAD A MAJOR IMPACT ON THE FISCAL OPERATION THE FOR GROUNDS. AS ALMOST EVERY MAJOR EVENTS WERE COUNSELED IN TWENTY TWENTY AND ARE STILL UNCERTAINTY AS FOR THE REMAINDER OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. FOR EXAMPLE CAL EXPO IN SACRAMENTO DEL MAR IN SAN DIEGO. AND LAKE FAIRGROUNDS IN LAKE COUNTY HAVE REPORTED FINANCIAL CUTS. AND LAYOFFS AND EVEN HAVE BECOME GO SITES TO GO SITE FOR TESTING AND ACTION. GIVEN THE DROP CALIFORNIA'S RISK OF MAJOR FARMING TYING. HELLO ALREADY SEEMS. WILDFIRE ACTIVE. SO FAR THIS YEAR THE BILL. OVER TO THE THREE FORTY FIVE DOLLARS AND FORTY THOUSAND FORTY ACRES DESTROYED THIS AN INCREASE OF. TWELVE HUNDRED EIGHTY FOUR FIRES AND ELEVEN THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED NINETY THREE ACRES FROM LAST YEAR.

BEFORE WE BEGIN LET ME TURN IT OVER TO ASSEMBLYMEMBER ROBERT RIVAS CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE AND JOINT COMMITTEE ON FARES ALLOCATIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS FOR HIS OPENING REMARKS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER RIVAS. WALA THANK YOU SHARE RODRIGUEZ AND- I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP IN AND WORK IN THE CRITICAL AREA OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AND NOT ONLY AS CHAIR OF.

TECHNICIAN OR AN EMT- AND SO I WANT TO OUR CALL ALL WHO HAVE JOINED US HERE THIS AFTERNOON FOR THIS HEARING. I LIKE TO THINK OUR COMMITTEE STAFF FROM BOTH AGRICULTURE AND EMERGENCY- SOME- THE MANAGEMENT FOR THEIR PART IN HELPING PLAN TO PREPARE FOR THIS INFORMATIONAL HEARING YOU KNOW AGAIN I LIKE TO THINK CHEN RODRIGUEZ FOR. ENGAGING THE ASSEMBLY AGRICULTURE AND THE JOINT- COMMITTEE ON FARES ALLOCATIONS AND CLASSIFICATION. A TO HAVE A DISCUSSION TO LEARN ABOUT THE CRITICAL ROLE OF FAIRGROUNDS IN CALIFORNIA'S EMERGENCY RESPONSE SYSTEM. MOST OF US THE FAIRGROUNDS PRIMARILY AS SITES FOR ANNUAL FAIRS AND SOME OTHER WELL KNOWN SEASONAL VENUES SUCH AS ENTERTAINMENT IN SOME COMPETITIONS INCLUDING HORSE RACING CAR RACING OR- RODEOS- HOWEVER AS THE IMPACT OF SOME DISASTERS HAVE BECOME MORE EXTENSIVE IN COMMON HERE IN CALIFORNIA. IT IS CLEAR THAT FAIRGROUND LOCATIONS ALL SEVENTY SIX OF THEM. ARE IN THE CENTRAL PART OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE NECESSARY TO RAPIDLY AND EFFECTIVELY RESPOND- AMID TIMES OF NATURAL DISASTERS AND PUBLIC EMERGENCIES. AS WE ALL KNOW TWENTY TWENTY WAS THE LARGEST MOST DESTRUCTIVE WILDFIRE SEASON RECORDED IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY. WITH THREE FOURTHS OF CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING EXTREME DROUGHT THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE WILDFIRE SEASON MAY BE JUST AS LARGE AND DESTRUCTIVE AS LAST YEAR. AND IN ADDITION TO BEING CRITICAL SITES FOR OUR STATE'S WILDFIRE RESPONSE. FOR THE PAST FIFTEEN MONTHS CALIFORNIA'S VERY GROUNDS HAVE ALSO SERVICE COVER NINETEEN TESTING CENTERS VACCINATION SITES SITES FOR CAL- YES COMMAND CENTERS AND SITES FOR HOMELESS SHELTERS. AS SUCH WE NEED TO MAKE SURE CALIFORNIA'S BACKGROUNDS ARE PROPERLY PREPARED TO HANDLE THE% UPCOMING FIRE SEASON AND OTHER- SOME DISASTERS THAT MAY HAPPEN AND OCCUR AGAIN THANK YOU LOOK FORWARD TO THE DISCUSSION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER ALSO JUST WANTED TO OPEN UP TO ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEES AND WHAT DO YOU LIKE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER DIRECTORY DO YOU HAVE QUESTIONS THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBERS RODRIGUEZ AND RIVAS FOR HOLDING ENJOYING MEETING- FOR AND FOR THE PANELISTS ON INFORMING US ON ONE OF IF NOT THE MOST RELEVANT. ISSUES. CALIFORNIANS ARE FACING TODAY. GROUNDS ARE A GREAT WAY TO THE CAN. TOGETHER BUT HAVE GROWN TO BE A CRITICAL. DURING TIME OF EMERGENCY. WE HAVE SEEN HOW CRITICAL CONNECTIVITY CAPACITY IS IN THE TIMES OF EMERGENCIES INCLUDING DURING THE STATE'S RECENT DEVASTATING WILDFIRES. THE ACCELERATED NEED FOR BROADBAND PARTICULARLY AT A REAL SIDES POISED TO ASSIST IN AN EMERGENCY CANNOT BE IGNORED. I HOPE TO HEAR MORE ABOUT HOW TO KEEP FOLKS CONNECTED DURING THE MOST STRESSFUL TIMES OF THE YEAR OF THEIR LIVES. INVESTING IN FIBRE MIDDLE MILE WILL INCREASE SPEEDS AND ACCESSIBILITY FOR HOUSEHOLD THE COMMUNITY ANCHOR INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS FAIRGROUNDS. ACCESS TO THE INTERNET CONNECTIVITY IS ONLY ONE PART OF AN EQUATION THE DOES NOT WORK WITHOUT CONTINUED AFFORDABLE INTERNET SERVICE OFFERINGS ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE IN A RURAL DISTRICTS. AND I WANT TO MAKE NOTE THAT IT'S A I'M HONORED THAT- THE- MAY REVISE HAS BROUGHT UP OF PROXY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS TOWARDS BROADBAND IN WITH OUR LEADERSHIP OF THE SENATE AND THE ASSEMBLY. WE HOPEFULLY WE CAN MOVE THIS FORWARD AND. BENEFIT OUR FAIRGROUNDS THANK YOU. IN THE COURSE OF SOMEONE SARDAR VICE. TO MANAGE. THANK YOU. I THANK YOU FOR HAVING THIS YEAR A- THE IMPORTANCE OF. IN OVER DESIGN MAN IS A IMPORTANT FOR. US IS LEGISLATORS TO. TO KEEP IN MIND. IT IS CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE ESPECIALLY DURING A FIRE OF WHICH I GUESS THERE IS ONE NOW IN MY DISTRICT. AND ESPECIALLY FOR EVACUATION PURPOSES THEY HAVE ALL OF THE- FACILITIES NEEDED TO MAKE THE ADJUSTMENTS FOR WHATEVER THE DISASTER IS. AND SO IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO STAY ON TOP OF THIS ISSUE AND I APPRECIATE THE SPEAKERS TAKING TIME TODAY ON THE PANEL.

OP PLAY EMERGENCIES RECALL. I'M SINCE TO THE THIRTEEN- CAN SAID FIFTEEN PRESENT MAY DISASTER DECLARATIONS- YOU KNOW TO QUALIFY AT THE STAFF LEVEL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT- THE CORRELATES TO NEARLY FIFTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AND DESTRUCTION SO WHEN WE HAVE THOSE TYPES THE LEVEL OF DISASTERS- THE USE OF FOR TEMPORARY TEMPORARY RELOCATING. UP CLOSE TO A SAFE LOCATION- COMES UP TIME AND TIME AGAIN AND- FAIRGROUNDS HAVE PROVEN TO BE THAT- THAT HAVEN FOR US- DUE TO THE UNIQUE QUALITIES OF THOSE FAIRGROUNDS- THEY AREN'T NAY NOT ONLY SERVE AS AN EXCELLENT SITE FOR SHELTERING PEOPLE AND ANIMALS- BUT WE'D WATCH THEM MATURE TO BECOME CRITICAL LOCATIONS FOR US FOR LOGISTICAL HUBS. ARE BERMAN SHE RESPONSE OPERATIONS I WILL USE THEM AS BASE CAMPS- USER MISSTATING AREAS OF DEBRIS SUPPORTING. AND EVEN LONG TERM HOUSING SO- THERE ARE MULTIPLE MISSIONS- THAT THE- PROGRAMS ARE PERFORMED PRO STRING. RESPONSE AND RECOVERY. THE THAT THESE PROGRAMS LOTS OF SPACE- HAVE THE STILL THEIR PARKING AT. WATER POWER AND SEWER- MAKE THEM IDEAL LOCATIONS COUPLE THAT WITH THE- FACT THAT EVERYBODY IS FAMILIAR WITH THE LOCATIONS- AND THAT MAKES THEM. ARE VERY WELL SUITED FOR THESE NEEDS. DURING ACTIVATIONS WE AMPLIFY THE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE THESE SITES BY BRINGING IN GOLF CARTS OR ADA RESTROOMS FOR EXAMPLE FOR- OR EIGHTY EIGHT ARE THOSE NEEDING ACCESS AND FUNCTIONAL NEEDS ASSISTANCE SOMETIMES LAUNDRY FACILITIES EXTRA CITING ASSIGNING AND SIGNAGE- LIGHTING- SECURITY EXCEPT RUN SO WE HAVE PROVIDED A FAIR GROUNDS TO MAKE THEM EVEN MORE ROBUST- TO MEET THOSE NEEDS. BECAUSE THE FOR ARE ARE MANAGED BY OUR STATE PARTNERS IT THE- IS THAT I CAN CALL THEM AT ALL HOURS AND- WE USE THAT AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT- IN EVENINGS AND AFTER HOURS WHERE- WHEN WE USE COMMERCIAL SITES THEY'RE NOT NEARLY AS RESPONSIVE. AND CAN BE AVAILABLE TO US AND SO- THERE'S AN ADDITIONAL- ASPECT OF THESE GROUNDS IN THE FACT THAT THEY'RE RUN BY GOVERNMENT ENTITIES- TO HELP US ASSIST US- AS POINTED OUT PREVIOUSLY THERE VITAL PART OF OUR DISASTROUS. AND LISTED IN THAT PART OF OUR CAT PLANNING ACROSS THE BOARD- BECAUSE OF- THE ITEMS I MENTION EARLIER. AND EMERGENCY SERVICES ACT IS EXPLICIT ON THE OVERSIGHT ME ACCESS TO THESE PROGRAMS- BY CALLAWAY YES DURING EMERGENCY RESPONSE AND RECOVERY OPERATIONS. OUR PARTNERS HERE FROM CFA THEY SERVICE THE EMERGENCY FUNCTIONS SUPPORT LEAD- WE HAVE THESE EMERGENCY SUPPORT FUNCTIONS AND THEY RUN THIS IT'S AN INTERAGENCY- OUR SUPPORT FUNCTION FOR US AND IT'S- CALL THE S. UP ELEVEN. AND OTHER PRIME RESPONSIBILITIES OF PROTECTING OUR FOOD SUPPLY AND AGRICULTURE ANIMALS AND ALSO PARTICIPATING IS COORDINATED RESPONSE- GIVEN THE ESCALATION AND THE DURATION EMERGENCIES THAT WE'VE HAD. OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH CDFA HAS GROWN- AND- AND HAS BECOME A STRONGER THAN EVER- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS BECAUSE WE USE THESE BEFORE AS AS MENTIONED BETWEEN A COMMAND CENTERS POINTS OF DISTRIBUTION IN BASE CAMPS EXCEPT FOR WE ENDED UP HAVING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THESE SITES WERE CODED AS WELL- DURING A RAPID EXPANSION- TO MEET THE NEED FOR SUPPLIES TO SUPPORT- THE- MEDICAL COMMUNITY HERE IN CALIFORNIA DURING THE PANDEMIC- WE WOULD- WE USE THESE SITES AS WELL TO STORE TRAILERS OF SUPPLIES FOR US. ON A TEMPORARY BASIS WHILE WE WERE DISTRIBUTING THESE- THESE COMMODITIES ARE THROUGHOUT THE SITE WE ALSO USE THEM FOR LONG TERM HOUSING AS I MENTIONED EARLIER WHERE WE BROUGHT IN EITHER TRAVEL TRAILERS OR MANUFACTURED HOMES TO ASSIST THOSE THAT WERE DISPLACED IN THE GLOUCESTER- RESIDENCES- DURING THE- DO USUALLY DURING THE CATASTROPHIC FIRES. A FENCE. AS MENTIONED- OF. IS AN ISSUE FOR US AND IT'S PART OF OUR KEY INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENT THAT WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING- TAKE PLACE. AS A SURVIVOR COMING INTO A SITE OR AS A FIRST RESPONDER USING THE SITE HAVING ACCESS TO BROADBAND CAPABILITY SIMPLY MAKES THE OPERATION EASIER AND ASSIST THOSE IN AND IN DIRE NEED. WHETHER IT'S CONTACTING THEIR FAMILIES AND FRIENDS WE'RE DEALING WITH OUR INSURANCE CARRIERS- HAVING AFFECTED INTERNET SERVICE AND SUPPORT IS A CRITICAL FOR THAT- IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN- WE CONDUCTED ASSESSMENT- WITH- WORKING WITH CDFA AND DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY- TO TALK ABOUT BROADBAND IMPROVEMENTS FOR THE FAIRGROUNDS AND THAT EFFORT WAS SUPPORTED BY A GRANT- AND WE IDENTIFIED THE STUDY WAS COMPLETED FOR BY CHICO STATE. AND THE CARRIERS OF THAT- WE'RE COOPERATING WITH US THERE SUCH AS VERIZON AT&amp;T AND ALL THOSE OF OFFERED TO LOOK AT THOSE SITES FOR IMPROVEMENT- THEY DID. A FOR US AND WE PRESENTED THAT INFORMATION TO THE BROAD BAND- COUNCIL ON ALL SEVENTY FOUR FAIRGROUNDS- THAT- I CAN BE ACTIVATED DURING MERGE RESPONSE. AND WE FOCUSED PRIMARILY ON UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE UPLOAD AND DOWNLOAD SPEEDS OF THOSE SITES WERE- INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH UPGRADES- FOR THOSE SITES. WE MEASURE THEM AND- PUT TOGETHER THIS COMPREHENSIVE- BREEDING IN PLAN UP FOR THAT SO THAT WE COULD- SEE WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO- ENHANCE THE BROADBAND CAPABILITY- AT THE SEVENTY FOUR FAIRGROUNDS- ACCORDINGLY YOU KNOW WE- ARE ENCOURAGED THE USE OF THE IMPROVEMENTS OF THE FAIRGROUNDS OF FOR THAT. AND IT'LL ONLY HELP AND IMPROVE OUR OPERATIONS FOR FUTURE OPERATIONS- DOWN THE ROAD- BEFORE I WRAP UP I WANT TO DO- REITERATE HOW IMPORTANT FAIRGROUNDS ARE FOR MERGING RESPONSE AND RECOVERY. AND I- THANK THEM FOR THEIR PARTNERSHIP I KNOW THIS IS NOT EASY FOR A PROGRAM MANAGER TO GIVE UP. ON THEIR SITES- BUT THEY'RE CRITICAL TO OUR SUCCESS AND WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THEIR EFFORTS- WE CAN CRITICS CONTINUE TO INTEGRATE- CFA AND THE LOCAL FAIRGROUNDS IN OUR CATASTROPHIC PLANS.

OR NOT I THINK IT BE BENEFICIAL TO DISCUSS QUICKLY CAL FIRE'S ROLE IN EMERGENCY RESPONSE. CALPERS CHARGED WITH FIRE PREVENTION AND FIRE PROTECTION THIRTY ONE MILLION ACRES OF STATE RESPONSIBILITY AREA FROM THE THREAT OF WILDFIRE. AND CONDUCTION CONJUNCTION WITH OUR FEDERAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT FIRE SERVICE COUNTERPARTS WE ARE AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE CALIFORNIA FIRE SERVICE. CHALFORD DELIVER SERVICE LOCALLY ACROSS TWO REGIONS IN TWENTY ONE OPERATIONAL UNITS. WITH A FLEET OF STRATEGICALLY PLACED GROUND AND AERIAL FIREFIGHTING RESOURCES WE MAINTAIN A NETWORK OF DISPATCHING COORDINATION CENTERS FOR COMMAND AND CONTROL AND ACCOUNTABILITY OF FIREFIGHTING RESOURCES. AND WE MAINTAIN SIX ALL HAZARD INCIDENT MANAGEMENT TEAMS TO PROVIDE MAJOR INCIDENT MANAGEMENT SUPPORT. TECHAU FIRE UNITS AS NEEDED. I OFFICE THE STATE FARM ARE. IS ALSO IN A BOOK. OF SOME BACKGROUND ON WHILE FIRES AND- THE CLASSIFIED AS A NEW ATTACK THOSE FIRE THAT CAN BE CONTAINED WITHIN TWO EXTENDED ATTACK THE THAT COULD BE CAN WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS AND MAJOR FIRES THOSE WHICH CAN BE CONTAINED OVER MULTIPLE TWENTY FOUR HOUR PERIODS. WHEN EXTEND ATTACKER MAJOR FIRE DEVELOPS A CONSIDERABLE FIREFIGHTING FORCES A MASS. TO ADDRESS THAT EMERGING THREATS THE INCIDENT COMMAND SYSTEM IS UTILIZED TO SCALE TO THE RESPONSE AND AS THE COMPLEXITY OF THE INCIDENT INCIDENT INCREASES SO TOO. DO THE DEMANDS ON THE COMMAND GENERAL STAFF. INCIDENT COMMANDERS DEVELOP A PLAN TO MITIGATE THE INCIDENT AND THEY PLACE ORDERS TO EXECUTE THAT PLAN. AS FIREFIGHTER RESOURCES CONVERGE ON THE FIRE AREA COMING FROM ALL CORNERS OF THE STATE FROM CAL FIRE FEDERAL. AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT. FIRE DEPARTMENTS VIA MUTUAL AID. AS THEY ARRIVE WOULD YOU F. TO RAMP UP TO. THE FIREFIGHTERS. THIS IS BEEN Y. TO THIS OVER. ASCENT LOCATION CAPABLE FOR SO. THE SCHOOL JUST WHAT BECAUSE ESSENTIAL. THE FACILITY CAPABLE OF COMEDY COMMAND OPERATIONS. LOGISTICS AND FINANCE FUNCTIONS IS SELECTED IN THE INCIDENT BASS IS BORN. WE CAN BUILD AN INCIDENT BASED ON A COLLEGE A SCHOOL AN OPEN. PARK WHERE OTHER VACANT OF NESS. A FAIR GO ARE OFF UTILIZE INSTEAD BASIS. AS DISCUSSED- EARLIER. AS A LAY OF THESE. CAN BE LEFT TO PROCESS. THE VARIOUS. OF AN INCIDENT BASS A PAVILION THAT'S NOT USED TO SHOW LIVE. COULD BE REPURPOSE INTO MOST OF YOUR- A CARNIVAL. IS INTO A PRE AREA. AND HALLS ARE. THE HOUSE FIND AND THE FUND. IN TWENTY FAIR OF THE BRIDGE EXPANSE THE STATE USED. AS THE FOUNDATION OF INCIDENT BASED SUPPORT UP TO EIGHT THOUSAND FIREFIGHTERS FOR LONG DURATIONS THROUGHOUT THE FIRE SIEGE. BURKE ROUNDS WERE UTILIZED FOR THE MANY MANY OF THE MAJOR FIRE FROM THE TWENTY TWENTY FIRES EACH INCLUDING THE OFFICE COMPLEX THE NORTH COMPLEX CREEK FIRE. AND S. C. LIGHTNING COMPLEX. SO MANY ACTIVITIES THAT HAPPENED AN INCIDENT BASS. REQUIRE AS SIGNIFICANT LOGISTICAL EFFORT. MULTIPLE FUNCTIONS WORKING CONCERT TO ENSURE THE MANAGEMENT OPERATIONAL OBJECTIVES OF THE INCIDENT ACCOMPLISHED ANSWERED BASES WHERE THE INCIDENT COMMAND POST THE FOOD UNIT PUBLIC. INTERAGENCY SUPPORT AND MANY OTHER FUNCTIONS ARE COLOCATED DURING AN ANSWER THAT PARKING FOR HEAVY EQUIPMENT IS EASILY ACCOMPLISHED A FAIR GROUNDS WITH FUELING AND GROUND SUPPORT FUNCTIONS SUPPORTED VERY WELL THERE. WE WORK WITHIN THE LIMITATIONS OF EACH SITE AND WE ADAPT ACCORDINGLY. AND THE OFFICE OF THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL INSPECTS THE FAIRGROUND FACILITIES USED TO ENSURE FIRE LIFE SAFETY STANDARDS AND MITIGATIONS ARE IN PLACE FOR THE DURATION OF THE EMERGENCY YESTERDAY AND THIS CRITICAL WORK ENSURES ONSITE SAFETY OF EMERGENCY PERSONNEL AND THE PUBLIC. SOME ELEMENTS OF AN INCIDENT BASED REQUIRE SPECIALIZED MOBILE UNITS SUCH AS MOBILE COMMUNICATION CENTERS- MOBILE KITCHEN UNITS AND THEIR SUPPORT TRAILERS MEDICAL TEAMS BURNING TRAILERS AND MOBILE GLOBAL INFORMATION. SYSTEM SUPPORT TRAILERS WHICH ARE EASILY POSITION AS WELL ON FAIRGROUNDS. IN TWENTY TWENTY WE ADAPTED TO THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC IN OUR INTERNET BASED LAYOUT DESIGNED TO ACCOMMODATE ADDITIONAL HAND WASHING STATIONS HAND SANITIZER STANCHIONS. AND SOCIALLY DISTANCE BRIEFLY AND FEEDING. AREAS WE ALSO MASS TEMP SCREEN TECH AND WHERE ABLE TO LIVE STREAM. TO ALLOW FOR REMOTE AND EVERY FOR. THERE ARE SOME LIMITS WITH. AND THAT'S USUALLY BASED ON THE FIRST SCHEDULE AND FAIR SCHEDULED ARE OFTEN THE MONTHS WERE CAUGHT FIRES WILDLAND IS THE MOST ACTIVE. TWENTY TWENTY MANY THE SITES FOR USED FOR NINE TEST. AND FOR EVACUATION CENTERS DURING THE TWENTY POINT FIRE SIEGE I'M MORE CALM DISABILITIES THESE WERE CONCERNED BUT OVERCOME BY INNOVATIVE AND FLEXIBLE AND SET DESIGN. WE DO NOT EXPECT FAIR GROUND OPERATION TO SEIZE WITH OUR PRESENCE AND WE MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO BE GOOD PARTNERS TO OUR LOCAL FAIRGROUNDS. AS I CLOSER LIKE TO CIRCLE BACK TO THE CENTRAL QUESTION OF THIS PORTION OF THE HEARING WHICH IS- OUR FAIRGROUNDS PREPARE TO MEET THE ONGOING STAGING BASE CAMP NEEDS FOR CALIFORNIA'S OPERATIONS. IN GENERAL FAIRGROUNDS PROVIDE ABILITY FOR CALIFORNIA WEEKLY ORGANIZED AND CENTRALIZED COMMAND GENERAL STAFF FUNCTIONS IN SUPPORT OF MAJOR INCIDENTS. FOR MANY OF THE SAME REASONS THAT FAIRGROUNDS ARE VITAL AND ICONIC COMMUNITY FIXTURES THEY ARE BENEFICIAL TO FIREFIGHTING EFFORTS. I WANT TO SAY THAT TWENTY TWENTY ONE HAS CONDITIONS LINING UP THAT POINT TO ANOTHER CHALLENGING FIRE YEAR. IN FAIRGROUNDS WILL PLAY A LARGE PART IN EIGHTEEN AS A MITIGATING THAT CHALLENGE. I THANK YOU AGAIN TO THE CHAIRS AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEES AND CREATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO OFFER TESTIMONY ON THIS TOPIC AND I WELCOME ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- CHIEF NO BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR MEMBER QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS. I JUST HAD A QUICK OF.

SOME OF OUR PROGRAMS OF THE STATE WE ALREADY PRE DEPLOYED- SYSTEMS THERE SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO MOVE AROUND AS MUCH STUFF THAT OKAY WHERE DO NOT THIS PROGRAM OR THAT PROGRAM ALREADY HAVE OF SOME- EQUIPMENT THEY'RE READY FOR WHAT WE SHOW UP FOR A BIT DEPENDING WHAT THE- THE FARES USED. FOR YES THERE ARE MORE LOOK THROUGH THE STATE- A PER. WHAT WILL YOU FOR STATE AREAS FOR PRE APPLY OR PRE- AND PROD OVER AREAS THAT WE TRADITIONALLY USE FOR. ANDERSON WELL. A MAN. IN QUESTION A ARE CURRENTLY A COURT TO SEVERAL QUICK. FOR SITE THE FAIR TO ME OF JUST THE WHOLE OF WE HAVE EMERGENCY AND MY- WE- MAY OF YOU KNOW THAT I'VE- PLAN MOST FIRE. THAN ANY OUT OF. NOTHING TO BE OF BUT I AM PROUD OF THE FACT OF PEOPLE TOGETHER. THE CONGREGATE AT THE FAIR GROUNDS THE CA COMES TO. AND JUST DOESN'T OF CINNAMON. CENTER WHEN FIRE WENT REFER THROUGH SOME COUNTY WE MOVED HUNDREDS OF DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED PATIENTS FROM OF THAT LOCATION TO FAIRGROUNDS IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. AND EVERYBODY CAME TOGETHER THE COMMUNITY THE NATIONAL GUARD TO HELP MOVE OUR PATIENTS IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT AND WAS AT A FAIRGROUND. SO WE JUST WANTED TO. BRING THAT UP BECAUSE I THINK WE FORGET ABOUT- SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS THAT WE SAVE A LOT OF LIVES THAT DAY AND WE HAD A PLACE FOR THEM TO GO SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR HARD WORK. ENFORCING A POLICY. OF THE SUMMER. SOMEONE OR HOW DO YOU HAVE A QUESTION COM. YEAH THANK YOU I REALLY APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATION TODAY I CHRIS WARD FROM THE SEVENTEENTH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT WHICH INCLUDES THE DEL MAR FACILITY THE TWENTY SECOND I CALL OF THE STRICT- FAIRGROUNDS. AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE- THE DEVELOPMENT IN THE PARTICIPATION THAT THAT YOU'RE PROVIDING FOR OUR RESPONSES TO EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT EVOLVING THAT HAS BEEN YOU KNOW THIS REALLY HARKENS FOR OUR REGION BACK TO THE 200-032-0007 WILDFIRES WHEN. THE DEL MAR FAIRGROUNDS WERE RESPONDING TO SOME OF THEIR YOU KNOW EARLIEST- MAGNIFIERS THAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE STATE OF FOR- THAT WERE IMPACTING IN IN AND ARE READ. AND WE ALSO KNOW AT THE SAME TIME WE HAVE LONG STANDING INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS OF MAYBES FAIRGROUND SOME WONDERING FROM ANY OF OUR- C. AGENCY REPRESENTATIVES IF YOU COULD TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT. MAYBE BRINGING TOGETHER IN THIS MOMENT SORT OF THE- AND WEAVING IN. BOTH THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE HAVE FOR THIS FUNDING TO BE ABLE TO MODERNIZE AND PROVIDE FOR THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT BUT ALSO SORT OF MEET. SOME OF THE LONG STANDING FACILITY CONDITIONS MEANS THAT WE KNOW MANY OF OUR AGRICULTURAL FACILITIES. HAVE BEEN HAVE BEEN WANTING THAT KIND OF SUPPORT AS WELL ARE WE LOOKING AT SORT OF A STRATEGIC PLAN FOR- REALLY SATISFYING BOTH NEEDS- FUTURE. EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT MODERNIZATION INFRASTRUCTURE WIFI BUT ALSO. THE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE DEFICIT THAT MANY OF OUR FAIRGROUNDS FACE. YEAH I CAN GO AHEAD AND ADDRESS THAT QUESTION IF THE CHAIR WANTS TO DO THAT RIGHT NOW. YES GOOD. YEAH YOU BRING UP AN INTERESTING POINT BECAUSE WITH THE REVISED AND GETS NO SECRET THAT THEIR MONEY SO ASIDE FOR COMMUNITY RESILIENCE PROJECTS IT INCLUDE FAIRGROUNDS AND JACKSON'S WITH THE WE GOT A QUESTION EARLIER THIS WEEKEND I'VE BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE HEARING IN THE INTENT RIGHT NOW IS TO WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH OUR OTHER STATE AGENCY PARTNERS AND ENGAGE THE COMMUNITIES IN THE AREAS. AROUND THE STATE WE DON'T WANT TO DO A ONE SIZE FITS ALL IN THAT IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ASSESS THE NEEDS AND THESE DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES BASED ON A LOT OF DIFFERENT FACTORS SUCH AS LOCATION DEMOGRAPHICS THE TYPES OF DISASTERS LIKELY TO HAPPEN IN ASSESS THE NEEDS OF WHAT THEY HAVE AND WHAT THEY MIGHT NEED TO RESPOND TO THAT AND SO OUR INTENTION AT THIS FUNDING IS APPROVED. MADE AVAILABLE IS THAT WE ARE GOING TO WORK WITH OUR OTHER STATE AGENCY PARTNERS AND WE'RE GOING TO DEVELOP A STRATEGIC OUTREACH STRATEGIES WHERE WE CAN GATHER THAT INFORMATION AND INTERACT WITH THE PEOPLE WHO ARE CLOSEST TO THESE FACILITIES THERE TO UNDERSTAND HOW BEST TO SPEND NOW TO MAKE THE INVESTMENTS IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE SO THAT IT CONSERVE THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE FUNCTIONS AS WELL AS- IF IT CAN BE LEVERAGE FOR OTHER FUNCTIONS THAT'S HELPFUL TO THE FAIRGROUNDS.

MANY TIMES WE SERVE OUR COMMUNITY IN WAYS THAT THEY MAY NOT EVEN REALIZE ARE POSSIBLE. UNTILTHE ACTUAL NEED ARISES- TO JUST. KIND OF BORROWED TERM. MR MARSHALL BROUGHT I IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET- THERE IS- THE TERM HAS BEEN DEVELOPED IS THE COMMUNITY RESILIENCY CENTER- IN EVERY YEAR- FACILITIES ARE CALLED UPON TO EAT. IN A RARE INSTANCE ASTRA FOR ITS OWN THESE DAYS REALLY HAVE MADE A CALIFORNIA FAIRGROUNDS THE ORIGINAL COMMUNITY RESILIENCE CENTER AND WE HAVE TO PERFORM THESE DUTIES FOR YEARS. SOMETIMES. WITH AND WITHOUT. UNDERSTATED INTERFERE OR INTERFERING IN- BEING PART OF THAT HI AND MANY TIMES WE SERVE OUR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS FIRST- AND THEN THE STATE AFTER AFTERWARDS SO THERE ARE SOME OBVIOUS EFFORTS. THAT ARE USUALLY GOOD FOR ABOUT THE STATE THOSE INCLUDING HOUSING FOR RIGID PERSONNEL HOUSING FOR DISPLACED RESIDENTS IN OUR ANIMALS SCHOOLS ALL OF THE EMERGENCY EVACUATIONS. FIRE CAMPS AND WHATNOT- BUT WE DO ALSO FIND HERSCHEL'S FREQUENTLY ACTING AS EMERGENCY FOOD DISTRIBUTION SITES FOR FOOD BANKS ACTING AS COLLECTION SITES FOR DONATIONS. EVEN SERENA HAS WAS BROUGHT OUT AS STORAGE SPACE FOR OTHER STATE GENCIES AND LOCAL AGENCIES IN. ORDER TO BE ABLE TO DO THEIR- YEAH THERE THERE NEED AS THEY HAVE THEY MOVE FORWARD WITH WITH SUPPORTING CALIFORNIANS- IN QUESTION DURING THE PANDEMIC WE'VE ALSO FOUND. WE'VE BEEN CALLED UPON TO HOUSE THE HOMELESS AS WE BROUGHT UP I JUST TESTED A VACCINATION SITES AND ALSO PROVIDE THAT MY SHE SPACE FOR MEDICAL FACILITIES- S. IS BEEN MENTIONED AS WELL WE DO HAVE FARES ARE CURRENTLY. HOUSING THE UNDOCUMENTED MIGRANT CHILDREN AND ALSO SOME OTHER SERVICES THAT ARE HELPING. LOCAL AGENCIES TO. S. THE FIGHT HIM HOMELESSNESS WE DO CURRENTLY HAVE SOME FAIR GROUND SWELL THAT ARE NOW CANCELING THEIR TWENTY TWENTY ONE FARES SPECIFICALLY IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO SERVE THEIR COULD LOCAL COMMUNITIES. AS WELL AS THE STATE THROUGH THIS TUMULTUOUS TIME. SO NEEDLESS TO SAY- AT THAT CALIFORNIA'S FAIR NETWORK ALWAYS STANDS READY TO SERVICE- AND HAS HAS DONE SO FOR YEARS- HOWEVER- AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED- THE FIGURES CONSERVE IN MANY DIFFERENT WAYS AND WHAT WORKS FOR A FAIR IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. MAY NOT NECESSARILY WORK FOR FAIR AND SOME CALIFORNIA. OR NORTHERN CALIFORNIA FOR THAT MATTER AND SO QUITE FREQUENTLY WE DO NOT LOOK AT A COOKIE CUTTER RESPONSES. BUT WE DO ALWAYS STAND READY TO SERVE AND DO OUR BEST TO BE ABLE TO OPEN UP OUR FACILITIES AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE IN ORDER TO DO SO WITH THAT SAID I'M ACTUALLY JUST LIKE TO PASS THE BATON UP TO EPIC HE PARTLY. FROM THE CINEMA COUNTY FAIR. SHE WILL SHARE SOME OF HER EXPERIENCES IN SERVING AND- AND THEN AFTER THAT. WE WILL MOVE TO BY MICHELLE RICHARDS AND DOWN FROM THE FROM THE OC FAIR. WILL SHARE SOME OF HER EXPERIENCES AS WELL I THINK IN THE OPEN FOR ANY QUESTIONS AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE SPENT. GREAT SOUNDS GOOD BOB DECHIARA EITHER. I AM THANK YOU VERY MUCH HELLO GOOD AFTERNOON THAT YEAR RODRIGUEZ SAID EACH YEAR RIVAS AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE- COMMITTEE REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR TIME TODAY I KNOW IT'S A VERY LIMITED AND YOU ARE ALL THREE VERY BUSY INDIVIDUALS- MY NAME IS BECKY BARTLING AND I HAVE THE VERY INTERESTING DISTINCTION TO OF OVERSEEING SEVEN WILDFIRE EVACUATIONS. TWO WHILE  WAS THE CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER AT THE DEL MAR FAIRGROUNDS AND FOR AS THE CEO OF THE CINEMA COUNTY FAIRGROUNDS FOR WILDFIRES THAT HAVE DEVASTATED ARE COUNTY IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS I'M SPEAKING TODAY SPECIFICALLY ABOUT WILD WILDFIRE EVACUATIONS BUT DON'T WANT TO IGNORE. THE IMPORTANT EFFORTS THAT FAIRGROUNDS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS. DONE IN SUPPORT OF ALL THE PANDEMIC. RESPONSE EFFORTS. YOU'RE GOING TO THE SITE FOR FUN FAIRS CONSUMERS SHOWS SPORTING EVENTS CONCERTS AND MUCH MORE BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTION IS TO SERVE AS EVACUATION CENTERS FOR NATURAL DISASTERS. WE ARE AT THE READY WHENEVER DISASTER STRIKES AND ACTIVATOR FACILITIES NO MATTER THE TIME OF DAY. FOR SOME REASON IT'S ALWAYS TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING BUT IT WOULD BE NICE IF IT WAS DIFFERENT BUT IT USUALLY TO- IN THE PAST FOR WILDFIRE EVACUATIONS I RECEIVED THE CALL. A LOT DURING THAT TIME TO OPEN FOR ANIMALS AND PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. MY TEAM. WON MOST OF THESE OCCASIONS HAVE JUST FINISHED UP SUPPORTING SOME EVENTS. ALL RUSHED TO ASSIST WITH THE EVACUATION. HAVING DONE THIS NUMEROUS TIMES BEFORE MY TEAM KNOWS THAT RED CROSS IN COUNTY SUPPORT WILL NOT BE ON SITE IMMEDIATELY. AND AS SUCH MOVES INTO ACTION SETTING UP COMFORT FACILITIES FOR EVACUEES. IF YOU'VE EVER BEEN AT AN EVACUATION SITE WHEN IT'S OPEN YOU KNOW THAT THE HUNDREDS OF FOLKS STREAMING AND ARE FRIGHTENED THEY'RE SCARED THEY DO NOT KNOW WHETHER THEIR HOME IS STILL STANDING. HOW THE ANIMALS ARE THAT THEY'VE LEFT AT HOME. OR WHETHER. THEY ARE WHETHER WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH THEIR OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS THAT THEY CANNOT CONNECT WITH. SMALL AMENITY COMMITTEES THAT WE PROVIDE IMMEDIATELY MAKE A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE WHEN THEY'RE START ARRIVING PLACE TO SIT DOWN WATER COFFEE AND JUST ASSURANCE THAT WE AT THE FAIRGROUNDS ARE HERE TO HELP THEM. SOUNDS TEAMS ARE THE IMMEDIATE ONSITE SUPPORT IN THESE EVACUATIONS UNTIL THE CALVARY COMES. IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ALLOW FIFTEEN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA FARE SERVED AS EVACUATION SITES FOR PEOPLE TWENTY FOUR SERVED AS EVACUATION SITES FOR ANIMALS AND TWENTY SERVICE FIRE CAMPS FOR CALIFORNIA- GRINSTEIN'S SUPPORT ALL THESE EVACUATIONS AND DO SO WITH FACILITIES THAT ARE OLD AND LACKING IN GOOD INFRASTRUCTURE. TO SUPPORT THE EVER INCREASING WILDFIRES. THIS AS YOU KNOW THIS PAST MONDAY WAS THE BEGINNING OF WILDFIRE SEASON. AND AS REPORTED THERE ARE HAVE BEEN HUNDREDS ALREADY OF WILDFIRES THAT ARE HAPPENING IT'S A WINDOW INTO WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THE SUMMER. WHAT FAIR PRINCE NEEDS ARE GOOD FACILITIES TO SUPPORT EVACUEES GENERATORS AND TRANSFER SWITCHES TO KEEP THE POWER ON WHEN PGD SHUTS OFF ELECTRICITY THAT PS PS. UPDATED OR NEW COOLING SYSTEM TRAILERS HOUSED ON SITE THAT CAN HOUSE COTS BLANKETS COMFORT KITS THAT WE CAN OPEN UP AND HELP PEOPLE WHEN THEY COME ON STRIKE- RED CROSS BY THE WAY DID HAVE A TRACTOR ON SITE TRADER TRACTOR ON SITE IN OUR FAIRGROUNDS. BUT IT'S SINCE MOVED THE TRACTOR TO THE TRAILER TO SACRAMENTO TO ONCE HOURS AWAY. NOT A QUICK RESPONSE. I STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT AND ANALYSIS OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE ON FAIRGROUNDS PARTICULAR ONES THAT ARE CALLED ON ANNUALLY TO SERVICE OF ACCUSATIONS SITES. SHOULD BE DONE AND ANNUAL FUNDING MUST BE MADE AVAILABLE TO FAIR SCHOOL PLACE MUST WALK WORSE AIR CONDITIONING ELECTRICAL UPGRADES. RESTROOM UPGRADES ON SITE SHOWERS AND THE OTHER NEEDS THAT SUPPORT EVACUEES. IS CINEMA COUNTY FAIRGROUNDS HAS BEEN ON THE CDFA LIST FOR MANY MANY YEARS FOR REQUEST. FOR FARES REQUESTING IMPROVEMENTS TO SUPPORT EMERGENCY EVACUATIONS AND UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO RECEIVE ANY OF A SMALL AMOUNT OF FUNDS THAT HAVE BEEN AVAILABLE AND IT WAS. AND HOPEFULLY THAT WILL CHANGE. COUNTLESS OTHER FAIRGROUNDS AS WELL CONTINUED ITS FUNDING. TO SUPPORT THEIR VACCINATION EFFORTS. DURING IRAQI. THE CINEMA COUNTY FAIRGROUNDS HAS A BUILDING WHERE ACCU ACT EVACUEES AND PETS OUR HOUSE TOGETHER. THIS BUILDING IS OLD AND THE SWAMP COOLERS MARKET EFFICIENT AT BEST. YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW THIS BUILDING MIGHT BE AFTER TEN DAYS IN AUGUST WHICH HAPPENED THIS LAST YEAR. PEOPLE IN THE BUILDING WITH INEFFICIENT SWAMP COOLERS WITH THEIR PETS FOR TEN DAYS. IN THE FORM OF ACCUSATIONS THAT I'VE OVERSEEN AND SONOMA COUNTY EACH TIME WITH PALS TO AVERAGE OF OVER A THOUSAND HUMAN ACTIVITIES AND CLOSE TO A THOUSAND ANIMALS. GRANTS ARE THE STATE'S EVACUATION SITES WHERE DO BACKING THESE GO DURING THESE WILDFIRES. THE BUTTE COUNTY FAIRGROUNDS READ WHAT ACRE FOR. THE PEDAL FAIR WHICH FAIRGROUNDS YOU FOR BROWN'S COUNTY FAIR NO MECHANIC. NAPA MODERN DOWN MAR ORANGE IN MANY MORE. THESE FOR GROUNDS NOT ONLY SIR IF. SITE BUT PROVIDES THE SAME FOR JUST. CLOTHING DISTURBING. LOCATION FOR FREE AND COMPANIES AND OTHER SUPPORT ORGANIZATIONS TO ENGAGE WITH VICTIMS OF THE WILDFIRES. BROWN'S OUR COMMUNITY ASSETS BUT WE'RE LOW COMMUNITY LOW COST COMMUNITY ASSETS AND DO NOT GENERATE SUBSTANTIAL REVENUES. WE SURVIVE ON THE REVENUE FROM OUR EVENTS WHICH OF COURSE HAS BEEN DEVASTATED SINCE THE CULVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC. WHICH IS WHY IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WORK TO IMPROVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE AT THIS FAIR GROUNDS AS WE ARE VITAL IN THE ABILITY TO CONTINUE BEING AFFECTED AND- EVACUATION SITES. TO SUMMARIZE LAST LESSONS LEARNED FAIRGROUNDS NEED TO HAVE PROPER INFRASTRUCTURE TO ADEQUATELY FACILITATE THE NUMEROUS EVACUATIONS TWO WORKAROUNDS THAT HAPPEN EACH YEAR. SECURED LIGHTING COOLING AND HEATING SYSTEMS WITH BACK UP GENERATORS PROPER BATHROOM AND SOUTH FLOWER SHOWER FACILITIES UPDATED ADA STANDARDS ELECTRICAL UPGRADES EMERGENCY BROADBAND ACCESS AND SCOLDED PARKING LOTS FOR PEOPLE WHO SLEEP IN THEIR CARS ON SITE AMENITIES FOR EVACUEES TOOTHPASTE CAUGHT TOWELS ETCETERA. INTO MEDICATION COURT APPOINTMENT SUCH AS RADIOS REFERRED TO SOMETIMES AS WALKIE TALKIES ARE WITH REPEATERS SO THAT WE CAN CONNECT THROUGHOUT THE PROPERTY FORKLIFTS TO HELP LOAD AND OFFLOAD EQUIPMENT FOR EVACUATIONS AND MUCH MORE LIGHT TOWERS ETCETERA. YOUR GROUND HAVE BEEN OPERATING EVACUATION SITES BUT THE MUCH BETTER INFRASTRUCTURE AND EQUIPMENT AND I'M VERY HAPPY TODAY AND THANKFUL THAT THIS HEARING IS HAPPENING AND I'M HOPING THAT YOU CAN HELP US PROVIDE BETTER SERVICE TO OUR EVACUEES IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU BECKY SO NOW THAT'S FINE WITH YOUR FROM- MICHELLE RICHARDS FROM ORANGE COUNTY FAIR SHOWER EITHER. I AM THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON SHARE RODRIGUEZ AND CHAIR RIVAS AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY I'M WONDERING IF I MIGHT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE MY SCREEN. WE HAVE A FEW PHOTOS TO SHARE IS THAT POSSIBLE. I BELIEVE SO. YES IT IS. OKAY. ALL RIGHT HERE WE GO THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY REGARDING THE CRITICAL IMPORTANCE OF FAIRGROUNDS THROUGHOUT THE STATE ARE WITH REGARD TO EMERGENCY UTILISATION MY NAME IS MICHELLE RICHARDS I'M THE CEO OF THE OC FAIR AND EVENT CENTER IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WE ARE THE THIRTY SECOND DISTRICT OVER CULTURAL ASSOCIATION AND I'M REPRESENTING THE MANY FAIRGROUNDS IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE STATE. OF NOW I'D LIKE TO BRING IT DOWN TO THE LOCAL LEVEL THIS IS WHERE THE ACTION TAKES PLACE AND WHERE FAIRGROUND STAFF SPRING INTO ACTION WHEN THERE'S AN EMERGENCY I'LL SPEAK SPECIFICALLY TO THE ORANGE COUNTY FAIRGROUNDS AND ALSO PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO THE COMMITTEE REGARDING THE OTHER FAIRGROUNDS IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE STATE. ON MARCH THIRTEENTH TWENTY TWENTY UNDERAN EXECUTIVE ORDER FROM THE GOVERNOR THE OC FAIR AND EVENT CENTER SHUT DOWN FOR BUSINESS. AND ONLY ESSENTIAL EMPLOYEES LIKE OUR SECURITY STAFF OUR MAINTENANCE TEAM WERE LEFT ON SITE. THE TWENTY TWENTY OC FAIR WAS FORCED TO CANCEL ALONG WITH OVER ONE HUNDRED LARGE EVENTS ALREADY SCHEDULED FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR. AT THE TIME WE ALL THOUGHT THINGS WOULD BE SHUT DOWN FOR A FEW WEEKS AND WE ALL GET BACK TO BUSINESS SHORTLY. BY JUNE IT WAS OBVIOUS WE HAD A FULL SCALE CRISIS ON OUR HANDS SO WE DID WHAT FAIRGROUNDS TYPICALLY DO DURING EMERGENCIES AND DISASTERS. WE REACHED OUT TO HELP OUR COMMUNITIES. BEGINNING IN EARLY JUNE AND CONTINUING UNTIL JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO WE TEAMED UP WITH THE POWER OF ONE FOUNDATION AND THE OC FOOD BANK. TO DISTRIBUTE FARM FRESH MEATS DAIRY PRODUCTS AND PRODUCE TO AN AVERAGE OF FIVE THOUSAND VEHICLES EACH SATURDAY. UTILIZING TWO OF OUR LARGE PARKING LOTS AND LOTS OF SOME OF THAT PRETTY SOON CAME FROM OUR OWN CENTENNIAL FARM. OUR BOARD MEMBERS VOLUNTEERS AND SO DID OUR STAFF IT'S WHAT WE DO BECAUSE WE TOO ARE PART OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE SERVE. BY SUMMER THE PANDEMIC WAS IN FULL FORCE AND WE PROVIDED TO ADDITIONAL PARKING LOTS TO WORK WITH THE COUNTY OF ORANGE TO PROVIDE FREE KOPET TESTING. THAT CONTINUED UNTIL JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO. IT WAS AN AMAZING OPERATION AND WE WERE HAPPY TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION. NEAR THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY PARTS OF ORANGE COUNTY WERE DEVASTATED BY TWO LARGE WILDFIRES ARE EQUESTRIAN CENTER SERVES AS A LARGE ANIMAL EVACUATION SITE AND FROM OCTOBER TWENTY SIXTH. THROUGH THE THIRTY FIRST WE HOUSE TWENTY FIVE COURSES EVACUATED FROM THE SILVERADO FIRE. NOT MORE THAN FIVE WEEKS LATER WE WERE AWAKENED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT TO ONCE AGAIN RESPOND TO THE BONFIRE. DECEMBER THIRD THROUGH THE SEVENTH WE HOUSING ADDITIONAL TWENTY ONE FOUR SIX. SINCE MARCH THIRTY FIRST THE OC FAIR AND EVENT CENTER HAS BEEN WORKING WITH THE COUNTY OF ORANGE TO HOST ONE OF THE FIVE SUPERPIPE VACCINATION SITES IN OUR COUNTY. THIS HUGE OPERATION UTILIZES THREE OF OUR LARGEST PARKING LOTS AND THREE OF OUR LARGE EXHIBIT BUILDINGS VACCINATING FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE PER DAY. AGAIN THE OC FAIR AND EVENT CENTER THE THIRTY SECOND DISTRICT AGRICULTURAL ASSOCIATION IS SO HAPPY THAT WE CAN BE A PART OF HEALING OUR COMMUNITY AND MOVING FORWARD FROM THE PANDEMIC. AND WE DID IT ALL WITHOUT BEING PAID FOR THE USE OF OUR FACILITIES BUT THAT'S JUST OUR STORY. IF YOU LOOK AT THE SLIDE THIS DETAILS THE OTHER FAIRS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND THIS YEAR. THAT HAVE ALSO BEEN CALLED INTO ACTION DURING DISASTERS WHETHER THAT BE TO SERVICE FIRE CAMPS- COALBED RESPONSE SITES ON ANIMAL EVACUATIONS. EARTHQUAKE CENTERS EXCEPT DROPPED. OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS FAIRGROUNDS THROUGHOUT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA HAVE BEEN CALLED INTO SERVICE DURING EMERGENCIES AND YOU'LL SEE THIS IS JUST A% QUICK LAST. BECAUSE BEARS ARE COMMUNITY BASED EVERY EMERGENCY RESPONSE IS DIFFERENT AND IS BASED ON WHAT THAT LOCAL COMMUNITY NEEDS AT THE TIME ALL FARES ARE IMPORTANT TO THEIR COMMUNITIES NO MATTER WHAT THE EMERGENCY IS. FIRES EARTHQUAKES FLOODS PANDEMICS. WE NEED TO ALWAYS BE IN A STATE OF READINESS BECAUSE YOU CAN'T SCHEDULE AN EMERGENCY. A VERY SMALL PORTION OF THE ACTIVATIONS THAT YOU SEE ON THIS LIST WERE FUNDED BY LOCAL AGENCIES. BUT MOST EITHER JUST RECEIVED HARD COST REIMBURSEMENT FOR STAFFING OR EQUIPMENT OR RECEIVE NO REIMBURSEMENT AT ALL. AS IN THE CASE OF THE- SEAFARERS EMERGENCY RESPONSE WE REQUEST REIMBURSEMENT AFTER THE EVENT FROM LOCAL AGENCIES AT EVEN AT THE STATE LEVEL BUT IT'S NEVER EASY AND IT'S OFTEN UNSUCCESSFUL. AND NOT JUST COVERS THE REIMBURSED HARD COSTS LIKE STAFFING AND EQUIPMENT BUT IT DOES NOT COVER THE LOSS OF REVENUE FOR THE RENTAL OF OUR FACILITIES. FUNDING IS CRITICAL IN ORDER TO REMAIN IN THAT STATE OF READINESS FUNDING FOR FACILITIES MAINTENANCE AMENITIES LIKE SHOWERS AND FOOD SERVICE FACILITIES FOR EVACUEES CRITICAL COMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE AND POWER NEEDS INCLUDING BACKUP GENERATORS. FAIRS LIKE THE OC FAIR AND THOSE ON THE SLICE GENERATE OUR OWN REVENUE. WE COUNT ON THE ANNUAL FAIRS AND OTHER EVENTS THAT WE HOST THROUGHOUT THE YEAR FOR THAT REVENUE. WHEN WE RESPOND TO EMERGENCIES WE NOT ONLY INCUR COSTS. BUT OUR BUILDINGS AND GROUNDS ARE TAKEN OFF LINE FOR ANY FURTHER REVENUE GENERATION SUPPORT IS CRITICAL IF WE ARE TO CONTINUE USING OUR FAIRGROUNDS THROUGHOUT THE STATE FOR EMERGENCY RESPONSES. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR LISTENING AND I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MICHELLE AND I BELIEVE- TOM YOU JUST WANT TO ADD SOME LAST COMMENTS. YES SIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I WANT TO ECHO SOME OF- BOTH MICHELLE AND- AND BECKY'S COMMENTS ON. YOUR FIGURES HAVE HISTORICALLY DONE A VERY GOOD JOB AND DOING A LOT WITH A LITTLE. AND SO IN MANY WAYS- OUR FACILITIES HAVE. BECOME DEGRADED BECAUSE OF THAT- THERE WERE TIMES IN THE PAST WHEN OUR FACILITIES WERE JUST FINE TO OPERATE AS EMERGENCY FACILITIES THEY THEY SERVE EVERYBODY'S NEEDS. BUT OVER THE YEARS BECAUSE OF THIS MENTALITY AND DOING A LOT WITH A LITTLE WE HAVE FOUND THAT OUR FACILITIES ARE NOW NO LONGER. UP TO DATE- THEY NO LONGER MEET THE NEEDS SOME EXAMPLES OF THAT WOULD BE THAT EVEN HERE DURING THE COPA NINETEEN PANDEMIC. WE FOUND THAT- OUR FACILITY WERE BEING TURN DOWN FOR USE. BY SOME OF THE FEDERAL PROGRAMS BECAUSE WE DID NOT HAVE. THE APPROPRIATE EIGHTY EIGHT- ACCESSIBLE FACILITIES ALSO OUR RESTROOMS WE DID NOT RELAX THE SHOWER FACILITIES THAT ARE NOT REQUIRED. THE TO ASK ONE OF THE IRONIES OF THIS IS THAT AT THE END OF THE DAY WHEN THERE IS A MAJOR. I NEED IN THE STATE TREASURER OF THE FIRST ENTITIES THAT ARE REACHED OUT TO- HAS BEEN SAID YOU KNOW. OUR FAIR MANAGERS HE OPERATE PRETTY MUCH ALL CALL BASIS AND YES AS OF THIS MONDAY- WE ARE NON WILDFIRE SEASON WHICH MEANS THAT I FULLY EXPECTS YOU ALSO MAY RECEIVE A PHONE CALL AT MIDNIGHT AND WE WILL MAKE OURSELVES AVAILABLE AND COME OUT. I THINK ONE THING THAT I WOULD LIKE OF THE COMMITTEES TO ALSO UNDERSTAND ABOUT. FUNDING ISSUES THAT WE HAVE IS THAT BECAUSE OF THE FACT AFFAIRS WERE UNABLE TO OPERATE IN TWENTY TWENTY AND ALSO NOW HERE AS WE GO INTO TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WE HAVE FOUND OUT THAT SO WE HAD TO LAY OFF MUCH OF OUR STAFF- SO IN THE PAST WHEN THEY SAY THAT WE DID A LOT WITH A LITTLE. WE WOULD UTILIZE OUR OWN STAFF. TO FULFILL A LOT OF THE NEEDS OF THE ORGANIZATIONS LIKE OH YES IN CAL FIRE AND RED CROSS AND FOR ANIMAL EVACUATION SERVICES. WE UTILIZE OUR OWN STAFF TO FILL THOSE NEEDS. AND NOW THAT AS WE GO FORWARD WE NO LONGER HAVE THOSE STAFF MEMBERS ARE AVAILABLE AND SO WE STRUGGLE WITH THE ABILITY TO. POTENTIALLY FILL SOME OF THOSE NEEDS AS WE MOVE INTO RIGHT INTO THIS. TERRIBLE FIRE SEASON IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND ALSO AS MICHELLE SAID. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE NEXT. POSSIBLE PANDEMIC OR THE NEXT. THE NEXT NEED WILL BE TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO YOU KNOW FOR US AS FARES- WE DO NEED EMERGENCY FUNDING IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO BRING OUR FACILITIES BACK ON LINE. BUT I ALSO THINK ANOTHER THING THAT'S IMPORTANT HAS BEEN ADDRESS HERE. BY A COUPLE OF THE DIFFERENT- PANELISTS YOUR FIGURES WE ARE FAIR GROUNDS FIRST AND WE SERVE OUR COMMUNITIES AS FAIRGROUNDS. WE REALLY SERVE IN ANY WAY POSSIBLE BUT- BUT RIGHT NOW OUR NEEDS. ARE TO BE ABLE TO BROUGHT BACK ON LINE THAT TO BE ABLE TO SERVE OUR COMMUNITIES AS PLACES FOR GATHERING. AND KNOWING THAT THAT IN DOING THAT WE WILL THEN BE ABLE TO SERVE OUT FOR THE EMERGENCY OPERATIONS AS WE MOVE FORWARD. SO I ALSO LIKE TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER WARD FOR BRINGING UP ONE REALLY IMPORTANT TOPIC AND THAT IS THE- MODERNIZATION AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE DEFICIT- IT IS A BIT OF. A BIT OF AN ITEM THAT A LOT OF TIMES FAIRS AND DON'T WANT TO ADDRESS BUT OUR FACILITIES THE MAJORITY OF OUR FACILITIES WERE. BUILT IN THE FIFTIES AND A LOT OF FAIR GROUNDS HAVE NOT SEEN MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS SENSE THAT- YOU KNOW WE MAY HAVE AS AS WE REFER TO HERE AT THE- MADERA DISTRICT FAIR. ARE WE MANY TIMES CALL LIPSTICK ON A PIG WEEK WE'VE DONE A LOT OF THINGS TO MAKE THE FAIR TO MAKE THE FACILITIES LOOK NICE. OUT TO MAKE THEM USABLE BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY WE STILL ARE OPERATING WITH FACILITIES THAT ARE THAT ARE NOW CHRISTIAN SEVENTY EIGHTY YEARS OLD AND IN MANY CASES AFFAIRS ACROSS THE STATE ARE EVEN OLDER. SO YOU'RE GOING FORWARD OBVIOUSLY FUNDING IS IMPORTANT BUT I THINK THAT THE MOST IPORTANT ASPECT IF I CAN LEAVE YOU WITH ANYTHING IS THAT. WE DO STILL STAND READY TO SERVE AND WE ALWAYS WILL STAND READY TO SERVE. AND I THINK THAT- YOU KNOW WE REALLY APPRECIATE BEING INCLUDED IN THIS CONVERSATION TODAY AND I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO ALL OF YOU AS WELL AS TO ALL OF. THE OTHER PANELISTS WHO WERE. ALL TODAY SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU TO. AND THANK YOU THE REST OF THE- FOR YOUR CUSTOMER PURCHASE. NOW WILL BRING IT BACK TO OUR- THE COMMITTEE FOR ANY QUESTIONS. ONE THING I WANTED TO SAY JUST KIND OF BRIEFLY OF. THE FAIR THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF RHODE PROVIDING FOR MORE VALUABLE RESOURCES WHEN IT COMES TO EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS RESPONSE TO OUR- FIRST RESPONDERS OUT THERE. ARE DISTRICTS SPEAK BRIEFLY ON THE FAIR IN MY DISTRICT L. A. COUNTY FAIR AS ITS TRANSITION OUT TO. HOUSING THE ISSUE WERE HAVING OF THE BORDER WITH THE MIGRANT CHILDREN THERE TO REALLY TRANSFORM ITSELF INTO A- A COMMUNITY PROVIDE SERVICES AND RESOURCES FOR THE CHILDREN. NOT TO MENTION- IN TIMES OF NEED FOR FIRE EVACUATIONS FOR AND IN THAT CASE A LOT OF- ANIMALS OUT THERE- OVERSEE. FUNDING IS A KEY AS YOU TALKED ABOUT TO UPGRADE INFRASTRUCTURE. WITHOUT UPGRADING MEDICAL INFRASTRUCTURE BECOMES. VERY DIFFICULT AND CHALLENGING TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE THAT. THE RESOURCE IS THERE TO ASSIST OUR FIRST RESPONDERS IN THE TIME INDEED WHEN THEY COME. TO SET UP CAMPS AND PROVIDE SERVICES. COM SO WITH THAT DON'T KNOW HEARD IN. QUESTION BY ANY COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I THINK OF ARCHER RIVAS YOU HAD A QUESTION YEAH I DON'T HAVE ANY QUESTIONS I JUST REALLY APPRECIATE THE PANELISTS VERY INFORMATIVE- SPECIALLY THE SECOND PANEL YOU KNOW AS- AS WE KNOW IT- THESE EMERGENCIES ACROSS OUR STATE. OF THE GROWING THREAT OF WILDFIRES WHAT WE'VE EXPERIENCED- BE BECAUSE OF THIS PANDEMIC YOU KNOW CERTAINLY- THE NEEDS- AND- THE CRITICAL- SERVICES- THAT OUR PROGRAMS. HAVE PROVIDED- YOU KNOW OUR INCREDIBLE BUT YOU KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS- ONGOING IT'S EVOLVING- AND SO CERTAINLY THIS IS GOING TO BE AN ON GOING ON A DISCUSSION AS WE TRY TO DO WHAT WE CAN. TO ENSURE THAT BACKGROUNDS HAVE THE RESOURCES AND HAVE THE SUPPORTS- ESPECIALLY AS IT RELATES TO- OUR ABILITY TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO BUILD THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S NEEDED AT OUR FAIRGROUNDS ESPECIALLY IN IN IN IN ALMOST REMOTE AND RURAL AREAS OF THE STATE'S A REALLY APPRECIATE. ALL OF THE PANELISTS- MAKING THE TIME FOR US AND LOOK FORWARD TO- SOME ENGAGEMENT- IN THE FUTURE. THE BIGGEST CHECKING SOME REMEMBER I HAVE A ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHECK A CHARTER FROM G. MANAGEMENT. I THANK YOU ALL OF THE PANELISTS FOR YOUR INFORMATION ON- ON HOW THE FARES ARE DOING- HAVING- BEEN A VETERAN OF THE L. A. COUNTY FAIR I THINK I ATTENDED TO. IT'S GONNA BE BAD OVER HALF A CENTURY AGO AND- AND EVER SINCE- WE'VE GOT EVERY SPORADICALLY. BUT YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE THERE YOU REALIZE THAT THE UNDERLYING WATER SYSTEMS THE SEWER SYSTEMS AND ALL OF THOSE- ARE ARE ARE HALF A CENTURY OR MORE. OLD AS WELL. AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT INFRASTRUCTURE- AND YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT EVACUATION CENTERS AND MASS PEOPLE. THOSE ARE VERY VERY IMPORTANT TO STAY UP WITH. AN AYE I GUESS MY QUESTION IS HOW HOW HAVE THE FAIR GROUNDS THEMSELVES BEEN ABLE TO STAY UP WITH THAT OR ARE THEY JUST KIND OF. PUTTING PATCHES IN PLACE AND HOPING IT HOLDS- WE PROBABLY NEED TO MAJOR INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT IN THE UNDERLYING. UTILITIES AND THINGS LIKE THAT IN ORDER TO KEEP MAINTAINING- THE ASSISTANCE THAT WE CAN GIVE PEOPLE WHEN THEY DO EVACUATE. THAT CORRECT. VENTURA'S YOU LIKELY THEY ANSWER THAT QUESTION. YES WHOEVER ANSWERED WITH- I THINK THAT ANYONE OF THE THREE OF US AS AS FOR MANAGERS COULD COULD ANSWER THAT BUT I WILL TELL YOU THAT I BELIEVE THAT- WHILE THE WHILE YOU'RE FOR STRUCTURES ARE OLD THEY ARE NOT DILAPIDATED AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT DISTINCTION TO MAKE. WE'VE DONE A VERY GOOD JOB OF MAINTAINING WHAT WE HAVE. SO YES OUR INFRASTRUCTURE OLD HOWEVER THEY ARE WELL MAINTAINED. AND WE DO WE DO SPEND A LOT OF TIME A LOT OF MONEY ON MAKING SURE THAT THOSE INFRASTRUCTURES I HAVE BEEN A POWER WATER SEWER. A LOT OF THE- WHAT WEEK SOMETIMES CONSIDER THE NON SEXY UNDERGROUND- NOT VISIBLE UTILITIES- WE DO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO SUPPORT. THE NEEDS THAT WE HAVE AT THE FAIRGROUNDS- SO WHILE THEY GET WHILE THEY'RE OLD- THEY THEY ARE NOT IN A CONDITION. THAT WE LOOK AT THEM FAILING HOWEVER. THAT SAID. WE ARE BEGINNING TO COME TO END OF LIFE ON A LOT OF THOSE TYPES OF FACILITIES AND THAT USE A NEED THAT WE FORESEE HAVING THAT MANY FAIRGROUNDS ACROSS THE STATE. BECAUSE EVENTUALLY WE ARE GOING TO NEED TO REPLACE THOSE- PEOPLE ON HIM SO REALIZE THAT WHEN YOU DO SOMETHING LIKE SECRETIVE AND YOU HOUSING DEVELOPMENT OR A NEW SHOPPING CENTER. THEY LITERALLY GO THROUGH TEAR OUT EVERYTHING THAT WAS ALREADY THERE YOU COULD IN NEW PRODUCT AND- FOR THE MOST PART. THIS IS SOLELY IS THAT. WE SEE HERE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. OTHER THAN THE FAIR. IMMEDIACY FEW OTHER FISH LIKE SO FARM OPERATE. ARE REALLY LOOKING AT INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S MAYBE TWENTY TO THIRTY YEARS OLD WHERE SOME OF OUR INFRASTRUCTURES I CAN BE- CAN BE. RECESSION FOR WATER AND SEWER CAN BE UPWARDS OF FIFTY TO SIXTY YEARS OLD SO IT DEFINITELY IS A CONCERN FOR US. BUT I DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S THAT DISTINCTION MADE. THE SOCIALIZE IT WE DO HAVE ARE WELL MAINTAINED. GREAT THAT'S GOOD HERE THANK YOU. OUR TOM JUST HAD ONE QUICK QUESTION REGARDING THE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS- THROUGHOUT THE STATE WITH OUR FARES. WOULD YOU HAPPEN TO HAVE A NUMBER BY JOHNSON HOW HOW MUCH YOU THINK IT WOULD COST TO- KINDA HELP- REGARDING THOSE ISSUES IT INFRASTRUCTURE ACROSS THE STATE. I'M JUST CURIOUS BY CHANCE WOULD YOU KNOW. WELL I WILL TELL YOU THAT THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF SERVICES HAVE BEEN DONE CDFA HAS DONE SOME SURVEYS I'M- ALONG WITH AFFAIRS EXPOSITIONS. I CAN I WILL TELL YOU THAT I BELIEVE THAT THOSE SURVEYS THAT HAVE BEEN DONE I WOEFULLY UNDERSTATE THE NEEDS OF THE FAIRGROUNDS- AGAIN WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE FACT THAT MOST OF OUR FAIR FACILITIES. ARE AGING ARE WE CAN SOAK UP INTO AN INDIVIDUAL FACILITY MILLIONS OF DOLLARS RIGHT AWAY AND GIVEN THAT WE HAVE SEVENTY FOUR. FARES AND SOME OF THOSE FEARS HAVE EVEN GREATER NEEDS I'M ALSO JUST YOU CAN SIZE AND THAT'S ONLY FOR YOU JUST TO YOUR- YOUR UTILITY TECHNIQUES THAT WE ALSO. BUILDINGS COULD DO NOT HAVE AIR CONDITIONING THAT AS OF MICHELLE MENTIONED YOU KNOW WE UTILIZED A LOT OF SWAMP COOLERS- HAS AS BACK YOU MENTIONED YOU KNOW WE ARE FINDING OURSELVES IN THE NEED TO BE ABLE TO SERVE. WITH GENERATOR HOOKUPS WITH PS PS I HAVE AFFECTING US. ALL ACROSS THE STATE ESPECIALLY IN RURAL AREAS AND SO WHILE MANY OF THOSE ITEMS ARE BEING ADDRESSED- BY SOME OF THE GRANT PROGRAMS OF CDFA OFFERS WHICH WE GREATLY APPRECIATE- THE AMOUNT OF MONEY. THAT IS AVAILABLE TO US AT THIS TIME. IS WOEFULLY LACKING IN BEING ABLE TO BRING ALL OF OUR FACILITIES UP TO WHAT. WE CAN CERTAINLY CURRENT STANDARDS. THANK YOU TO AND WITHOUT WANNA MAKE SURE WE HAVE A AROUND THREE- THE BIKE. ADD ON A BIT I THINK IT WOULD BE ALL- RUN TO JUMP UP WHAT TOM MENTIONED THERE- ACTUALLY DO YOU KNOW THE NUMBER THAT IS TOM SAID- THESE NUMBERS DON'T REPRESENT THE WHOLE ENTIRETY OF WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE OUR SURVEYS. REALLY LOOK AT WORST OF THE WORST. THINGS THAT ARE BASICALLY. I'VE GOT A BILL AND NEED TO BE ADDRESSED RIGHT AWAY AS A HIGH PRIORITY- BUT THE LAST SURVEY THERE WAS AMONGST THE NETWORK OVER THREE HUNDRED MILLION IDENTIFIES. NEEDS AND THERE AGAIN JUST TO REITERATE THAT THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOESN'T MAKE EVERYTHING A BRAND NEW CHRISTINE AND- YOU KNOW LIKE A BRAND NEW CAR THAT YOU BRING OFF THE LOT. IT JUST BASICALLY BRINGS BACK THINGS BACK UP TO WHAT WE CONSIDER A MINIMAL FUNCTIONAL LEVEL. IN THE PAST FEW YEARS THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE THAT TOM MENTIONED WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO GET OUT AS GRANTS. IS REALLY ONLY SCRATCHED. THE SURFACE AND IT'S BEEN. OUR LAST IT'S ONLY LAST THAN TWENTY DOLLARS AND ENTIRETY. ABOUT MILLION CAME THE GENERAL FUND AD WE GOT SOME BOND MONEY FROM. SB SIXTY EIGHT SB. FIVE THANK YOU APPRECIATE THAT OF WHAT THAT SAID ANY OTHER. LAST COMMENTS BEFORE WE GO TO PUBLIC COMMENT. SO WITHOUT JUST WANT TO THANK ALL THE PANELISTS FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION IN YOUR PRESENTATIONS TODAY IT'S KIND OF GIVING US A AN EYE OPENING VIEW OF WHAT'S HAPPENING ACROSS THE STATE WITH OUR FOR GROUNDS AND THANK YOU FOR THAT YOU DO DAY IN AND DAY OUT.
