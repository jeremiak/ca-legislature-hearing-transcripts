HEARING ON CANNABIS I AM EXTREMELY HAPPY THAT CULTURE THIS HEARING WITH- MY COLLEAGUE MISTER LOCAL. WE'RE HOLDING HIS HEARING IN ANTICIPATION OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ON CONSULTING THE EXISTING LICENSING RESPONSIBILITIES ADMINISTERED BY THE BUREAU OF CANNABIS CONTROL. THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AGRICULTURE. DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH IN THEIR DEPARTMENT CANNABIS CONTROL BY JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THE GOALS TO IDENTIFY ANY ISSUES THAT SHOULD BE DISCUSSED WITH CONSIDERING CONSOLIDATION INCLUDING EFFICIENCIES STREAMLINING OF RESOURCES AND ENFORCEMENT. MR LOW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN- SIMILARLY- THE GOVERNOR ANNOUNCED THAT THERE WOULD BE MAJOR REORGANIZATION PLANS TO HAVE THE STATE CURRENTLY REGULATES CANNABIS AND AS WE ALL KNOW THE IMPERATIVE NATURE TO WHICH WE ENGAGE IN PRAGUE STAKEHOLDER INPUT WHICH- THIS IS PART OF THAT. CONVERSATION THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE MINISTRATION TO REGULARLY CONSULT WITH THE LEGISLATURE AS IT DEVELOPS THE DETAILS FOR THESE PROPOSALS AND SIMILARLY ANY REORGANIZATION TO BE CHIEF THROUGH STRONG PARTNERSHIP WITH THIS LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE- SO I THINK- OTHER EXPECTED MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND LOOK FOR TO THE- ADDITIONAL CONVERSATION. MISS LACKEY. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU REALLY WANT ME TO TALK. BECAUSE I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU. THE APATHY THAT WE HAVE UP HERE. AS PART OF THE PROBLEM. PART OF THE PROBLEM IS. THE ILLICIT MARKET IS ABSOLUTELY. DOMINATING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA NO ONE SEEMS TO CARE. AND I THINK THAT- THIS IS A GREAT STEP. MAKES SENSE AND HOPEFULLY BY DOING THIS WE CAN ADDRESS THE ENFORCEMENT ASPECT OF THE ILLICIT MARKET. SO I'M ALL YOURS. THANK YOU. WE'LL START WITH OUR OVERVIEW THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL REALLY TO CANNABIS REGULATION AN ANALYSIS OF ILLICIT MARKET AND FORSMAN EFFORTS. HELLO KIRSTEIN. GOOD AFTERNOON HEARING MEMBERS HOW INCREASING WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AS THE SURGEON SHOULD HAVE PASSED OUT- THREE DIFFERENT DOCUMENTS FOR YOU FIRST THERE'S A HEARING HAND OUT NOT BE I'M SPEAKING FROM A HANDOUT TODAY AND THERE ARE TWO OTHER REPORTS THAT- HOPEFULLY YOU HAVE WITH A PASSED OUT TO YOU AS WELL ONE IS A REPORT THAT WE DID BACK IN DECEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. IT TALKS ABOUT- CANNABIS TAXES AND ALL REFERENCE THAT BRIEFLY AND THEN THERE'S ANOTHER REPORT THAT WE RELEASED EARLIER THIS YEAR- THAT SHOULD ALSO BE PROVIDED TO YOU AND THAT REPORT IS- I'VE REPORT WE DID ON THAT BUDGET. PROPOSALS SO I'M GONNA STAT MY REMARKS- WITH SOME QUICK BACKGROUND ON CANNABIS AND PROP SIXTY FOUR THEN I'LL BRIEFLY SUMMARIZE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS. AND IDENTIFY SOME ISSUES FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION. SO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE ONE OF THE HAND OUT. ON THEIR SOME BRIEF BACKGROUND AS- I'M SURE ALL OF YOU KNOW PROP SIXTY FOUR. SIXTY FOUR ADULTS TWENTY ONE OR OLDER CAN LEGALLY GROW POSSESS AND USE CANNABIS FOR NONMEDICAL PURPOSES- THE MEASURE ALSO CREATED A REGULATORY STRUCTURE FOR CANNABIS- AND AS PART OF THAT IT DELEGATED RESPONSIBILITIES TO VARIOUS STATE DEPARTMENTS- ONE OF THE KEY RESPONSIBILITY. IS LICENSING OR THREE SEPARATE DEPARTMENTS THAT HAVE ROLES CURRENTLY FOR LICENSING CANNABIS BUSINESSES- YOU'LL HEAR FROM THOSE DEPARTMENT SHORTLY. ONE OF THEM IS THE PURE OF CANNABIS CONTROL WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS THERE'S ALSO THIS WHEN THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE AND THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. SO THEY REGULATE RETAILERS DISTRIBUTORS CULTIVATORS AND MANUFACTURERS. SO PROPERTY FOR ALSO ESTABLISHED A SYSTEM OF TAXING. TYPICALLY TO STATE EXCISE TAXES. I THOSE ARE ADMINISTERED BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION SO THE FIRST TAXES A 15% TAX. ON RETAIL GROSS RECEIPTS WE I REFER TO THAT OFTEN AS THE RETAIL EXCISE TAX. AND THE SECOND IS A WEIGHT BASED TAX- WHICH IS ALSO REFERRED TO AS THE CULTIVATION TAX. IF YOU TURN THE PAGE TWO OF A HAND OUT- WE KNOW THE CULTIVATORS AND RETAILERS BET BEAR THE LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ADMITTING THE TO TAXES I MENTIONED THAT CULTIVATION IN RETAIL EXCISE TAXES. HOWEVER PURSUANT TO SOME TRAILER BILL THAT WAS PASSED IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN IT'S ACTUALLY FINAL DISTRIBUTORS TO REMIT THE TAXES TO SEE TFA. SO THIS RESULTS IN KIND OF A MULTI STEP PROCESS FOR HAVING THE TAXES- FLOW THROUGH TO CD TFA. SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE FIGURE ON THAT PAGE- IT'S HER HIGHLIGHTS THAT PROCESS THIS IS THE EXAM SIMPLE MANUFACTURED PRODUCTS. IN SOME CASES IF IT'S A VERY IF IT'S COMPLEX MANUFACTURED PRODUCTS IT ACTUALLY MIGHT HAVE MORE STEPS BECAUSE IT MIGHT GO THROUGH MORE MANUFACTURERS. BUT IN THIS CASE THE CULTIVATE WOULD REMAIN THE TAXES TO THE FIRST DISTRIBUTOR. THEN TO A MANUFACTURER FOR MANUFACTURING THEN TO THE LAST DISTRIBUTOR AND THEN PRIOR TO GOING TO THE RETAILER- THE PRICE GOING THE RETAILER TAX WOULD BE PERMITTED TO SEE THE TFA. I ALSO JUST WANT TO KNOW IT'S ACTUALLY LITTLE BIT MORE. EVEN ON THE RETAIL SIDE AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT. RETAILERS GENERALLY HAVE TO MAKE PAYMENTS THEIR TAX PAYMENTS I BEFORE THEY MAKE A RETAIL SALE THEY ACTUALLY TO MAKE IT WHEN THEY PURCHASE THE PRODUCT. FROM THE WHOLESALER. SO BECAUSE OF THAT THE PRODUCT THAT TAX ACTUALLY HAS TO BE BASICALLY WHOLESALE TAX. EVEN THOUGH SERVE IN STATUTES RETAIL TAX SO ESSENTIALLY CITY TFA IS CHARGED WITH COMING UP WITH THE HOLES OF TAX EQUIVALENT. TO THAT RETAIL PRICE TAX AND THAT'S CALLED THE MARK UP. SO THAT'S KIND OF ANY OTHER MINISTRY TO STOP THAT THE TFA. MUST PERFORM. SO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE THREE. WE SUMMARIZE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS THEIR TWO MAIN PIECES AS AS WAS DISCUSSED EARLIER THE FIRST IS CHANGING THE POINT OF COLLECTION FOR CAP THE CANNABIS TAXES SO THAT BUDGET TRAILER LEGISLATION PROPOSES TO SHIFT THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR OMITTING THE CULTIVATION TAX. FROM SORRY TO THE FROM THE FINAL DISTRIBUTOR TO THE FIRST DISTRIBUTOR. AND RESPONSIBILITY FOR REMITTING THE RETAIL EXCISE TAX FROM THE FINAL DISTRIBUTOR TO THE RETAIL TO THE RETAILER. THE GOVERNOR INDICATES ALSO THAT HE'S CONSIDERING SOME OTHER TAX CHANGES TO POTENTIALLY TO THE TAX SYSTEM IN TAX RATES BUT WE HAVE IT- HEARD ANY DETAILS ON WHAT THAT MIGHT BE. SO SECOND THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING TO CONSOLIDATE LICENSING FUNCTIONS AS WE HEARD WITHIN A NEW DEPARTMENT. SO AS I MENTIONED BEFORE CURRENTLY THERE ARE THREE LICENSING DEPARTMENTS AND THOSE FUNCTIONS WOULD BE CONSOLIDATED INTO A NEW ENTITY KNOWN AS- THE DEPARTMENT CAMPUS CONTROL. THE ADMINISTRATION HASN'T PROVIDED ANY DETAILS YET ON THIS PROPOSAL AND ANTICIPATES PROVIDING THAT SOMETIME IN THE SPRING. SO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE FOUR WE HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE OF ISSUES FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION FIRST WITH REGARD TO THE POINT OF COLLECTION WE FIND THAT AT. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL SHOULD IMPROVE TAX ADMINISTRATION COMPLIANCE THE MAIN REASON FOR THAT IS THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WOULD. BASICALLY IMPROVE THE NEXUS BETWEEN- THE TAX ACTIVITY AND RESPONSIBILITY FOR OMITTING TAXES IT WOULD REDUCE THAT FOR OF HANDS BASICALLY THAT THOSE TAXES HAVE TO GO THROUGH. IT ALSO WOULD ELIMINATE THE NEED FOR THAT MARKET CALCULATION THAT I MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY. SO I STATURE THE LEGISLATURE RETAINS THE RETAIL EXCISING CULTIVATION TAX WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IN THAT AREA. HOWEVER AS WE MENTIONED IN OUR DECEMBER REPORT WHICH HOPEFULLY YOU HAVE A WE ACTUALLY ALSO RECOMMEND SOME ADDITIONAL CHANGES. TO THE CALIFORNIA- TO CANNABIS TAXES AS WELL AS THEIR RATES. SO SECONDLY ON THE ISSUE OF CONSOLIDATING LICENSING FUNCTIONS WE THINK THE GENERAL CONCEPT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE WE THINK IT HAS THE POTENTIAL. TO IMPROVE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CANNABIS LICENSING ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES. FOR EXAMPLE WE THINK IT COULD IMPROVE THE ACCOUNTABILITY THE SYSTEM FOLKS WILL KNOW THERE'S ONE ENTITY TO GO GO TO FOR ALL THESE THESE THESE ISSUES CURRENTLY WITH THREE DIFFERENT APARTMENT. A TRICKY FOR FOLKS TO KNOW KIND OF. YOU TO GET THE ANSWERS FROM. AND SOMETIMES THEY MIGHT GET. ANSWERS THAT AREN'T ENTIRELY CONSISTENT SO WE THINK THERE'S A LOT OF POTENTIAL ADVANTAGE TO HAVING ONE ENTITY- HOWEVER WE NOTE THAT. A LOT OF THEIR- DETAILS ARE GONNA BE VERY IMPORTANT AND SO THE LEGISLATURE'S REALLY GOING TO WANT TO DRILL DOWN. AND MAKE SURE THAT THE WAY IT'S SPECIFICALLY GOING TO BE IMPLEMENTED CONSISTENT WITH ITS PRIORITIES. SO ACCORDINGLY WOULD YOU RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE REQUESTS THE ADMINISTRATION PROVIDE. I THESE DETAILS AS SOON AS THEY CAN ON HIM HOPEFULLY SOONER IN THE SPRING RATHER THAN LATER FOR EXAMPLE- BECAUSE IT. CAN BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO EVALUATE THIS OF COMPLEX PUT. IT'S PER. PROCESS SO HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS YOU. THANK YOU TO SEE TFA IN IT MISTER SO MORE LIKE FOR CANDIDACY FOR ALCOHOL OR TOBACCO. SO I'M I'M A BRING MY COLLEAGUES- STAFF CHRISSY UP HERE AS WELL. SEC CHRISTINE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE SO- AT CD TFA- ADMINISTERS A- WIDE VARIETY OF TAX AND FEE PROGRAM CERTAINLY- ALCOHOL AND TOBACCO TAXES- ARE AMONG THEM AND PROVIDE SOME INSTRUCTIVE SORTS POINTS OF. COMPARISON FOR CANNABIS TAXES AND SO THERE ARE SOME SURFACE SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THOSE I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY FURTHER SPECIFIC QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. LOOK YET THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF. IT WAS A YOUR SUGGESTING HOW FROM THE BEHALF OF THE LA- WITH RESPECT TO. CODIFYING SOME OF THE PROPOSALS ON A TAXATION ON THE REFORMS OF THE TAXATION- THERE ARE SOME APPROVALS ON LOWERING EXCISING CULTIVATION SIMILARLY AS YOU WELL KNOW THAT IS. DISTINCT FROM THE LA OWES A PROPOSED- CHANGES UNTIL IF YOU IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO SPEAK UP ON THAT WITH RESPECT TO- THE REPORT THAT YOU PROVIDED. YEAH SO IN THE RIVER WE DID IN DECEMBER WE DID TALK ABOUT CAN THIS TAXRATES- SO ESSENTIALLY- WE LOOKED AT WE HAD A CHARGE SPECIFICALLY UNDER PROP SIXTY. PROP SIXTY FOUR AT OUR OFFICE OKAY THE ATTACKS MAKES A RECOMMENDATION TO ACHIEVE THREE PER. UNDER THE LIST MARKET I WOULD USING YOUTH USE AND RAISING SUFFICIENT REVENUES TO FUND THE PROGRAMS ENUMERATED IN THE MEASURE. SO AS PART OF THAT WORD FACE THE ANALYZED IT'S IF HE'S BASICALLY WE ALL EYES OF THE STRUCTURE. I'M ONE OF THE THINGS WE DETERMINED IS. FELT THAT THE CALL XIN TAXES A RELATIVELY WEAK TAX IT DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF ADVANTAGES. BECAUSE BASICALLY YOU KNOW THE OTHER TAXES COULD COULD COULD HAVE ACHIEVED FAME GOALS I'M AT THE MINISTRY OF A MORE COMPLEX I'M SO WE RAISED SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THEIR RECOMMENDING IF YOU KEEP RETAIL EFFECT ACTS GETTING CULTIVATION TAX- WE ALSO HAVE- POTENTIAL OPTIONS FOR HIS AS WELL BUT WHAT WE THINK. I'M MORE CONSIDERATE. CARE IF. YOU THE CALL TAX TO KEEP THREE TALKS I TAX AMERICAN. WE DO HAVE SOME RAY THAT WE WERE. AND BASICALLY. IN PRACTICE WOULD BE REVENUE OR POTENTIALLY SUBSTANTIAL TECH CUTS SO WE THINK YOU COULD DO BASICALLY A TAX CUT AND PROBABLY STILL RAISE SUFFICIENT REVENUES IT YOU HAVE TO SORT OF- STRUCTURE THAT NET. SO THAT YOU DON'T DO IT SO MUCH THAT YOU DON'T BUT YOU CAN'T REVENUES. SUBSTANTIALLY BUT- WE DO HAVE A THINK BETWEEN FIFTEEN AND 20% IF YOU JUST KEEP THAT RETAIL TAX. ON IT IF YOU WERE TO ACTUALLY GET RETAIN THAT CULTIVATION TAX THE RICH WOULD BE SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT. SO I DON'T KNOW IF THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION BUT WE DID BUT THAT THE TAX RATES AS PART OF THAT WORK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THEN AT THE NEXT AND WITH RESPECT TO THE CONCERN POSITION OF LICENSING FUNCTIONS INTO A NEW DEPARTMENT. A SIMILE AS YOU WELL KNOW AND THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS BCC AND A NUMBER OF OTHER ENTITIES A TYPICALLY THE LEGISLATURE WOULD RETAIN ITS OVERSIGHT CAPACITY ON THE SUNSET. THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED ON A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT ENTITIES UNDER DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS AND SIMILARLY THERE'S BEEN CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS THE EFFORTS. ON BCC BUT HE SAID WHEN THERE MIGHT BE A PROPOSAL FOR CONSOLIDATION IN THE DEPARTMENT. WHERE MIGHT THE LEGISLATURE AND ENSURE THE ABILITY FOR. THE OVERSIGHT OVERSIGHT FOR THE- BRAND IT'S- I THE NEXT QUESTION I THAT'S PROBABLY WHEN IT COMES. THAT'LL WILL KEEP IN MY AS IT. IT LOOKS AT THE- OF THE PROPOSAL I'M POTENTIAL I MEAN I THINK THERE% FREDDIE A POTENTIAL OPTIONS SO IT COULD REMAIN WITHIN ON BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS POTENTIALLY AND THERE COULD THE OVERSIGHT CONTINUE THEIR IT COULD BE WITHIN A DIFFERENT DEPARTMENT. SORRY A DIFFERENT COMMITTEE ON DEPENDING ON SORT OF YOU KNOW THE CHOICES OF THE LEGISLATURE- BUT WE DO THINK THAT CONTINUED OVERSIGHT IN THIS AREA IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT BOTH ON THE POLICY SIDE AND OF COURSE ON THE BACKSIDE AS WELL- IT'S- OF COURSE AN AREA THAT HAS. NOT ONLY WATCH LEGISLATIVE INTERESTS BUT IT'S SUCH A NEW AREA AND THERE'S SO MUCH GOING ON. THAT IT'S REALLY THE KIND OF THE KIND OF TOPIC THAT OPENS ITSELF TO REALLY ROBUST OVERSIGHT SO I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT- YOU KNOW THE DETAILS COULD YOU. COULD BE OUT THAT PROPERTY THAT. THE PROCESS BUT WE THINK IT'S CERTAINLY IS A CRITICAL FUNCTION FOR LEGISLATURE PERFORM. WELL HOW BOUT EVEN AT THE SIMPLISTIC NATURE TO WHICH IS. SIMILARLY WITHIN ANY OTHER ENTITIES ON THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS HAS THE LA- GIVEN ANYTHING TO THAT. ON I'M I'M NOT ENTIRELY IF ON SO I'M ANSWERING YOUR- I THINK THAT THE SUN. OF YOUR- OF A VERY. PROCESS FOR OVERSIGHT- AND NOT PROCESS- I THINK. IS A VERY- WELL ESTABLISHED AND- AND GOOD PROCESS FOR ENSURING OVERSIGHT SO THAT CERTAINLY COULD BE A MODEL FOR THAT COULD BE USED WHETHER IT'S WITHIN BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS ARE ANOTHER COMMITTEE. OF COURSE THAT'S UP TO THE LEGISLATURE BUT- BUT I THINK THAT PROCESS THAT TYPE OF PROCESS IS REALLY. VERY VERY VALUABLE ONE BECAUSE THAT SUBJECTS. THE HIGH THESE ENTITIES TO I THINK VERY SIGNIFICANT REVIEW AND OVERSIGHT AND THEY KIND OF HAVE TO PERIODICALLY COME FORWARD AND- AND REALLY EXPLAIN WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND MAKES AND IF THE LEGISLATURE GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE SURE THAT- THAT IT STILL COMFORTABLE WITH. THE PATH HAT THEY'RE GOING ON SO I THINK THAT'S A GREAT MODEL BUT OF COURSE IT COULD BE- COULD BE SHIFTED IF THE FACT THAT THESE ARE AS WELL. THANK YOU AND I THINK THE IMPORTANCE IS THAT WE WANT TO HAVE BROUGHT STAKEHOLDER INPUT IN. AND ACTUALLY PROVIDES THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS FOR PUBLIC INPUT IN PRAGUE COLDER ENGAGEMENT. AND FINALLY SIMILE IS IT YOUR ASSESSMENT THAT- WITH THE RE ORDER OF- THE DEPARTMENT THAT LEGISLATIVE APPROVAL WOULD BE REQUIRED FOR THAT AS WELL. YEAH SO I THINK UNDER THE- UNDER THAT WE UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS LIKELY TO. HE PROPOSES TRAILER BILL LEGISLATION AND OF COURSE THAT WOULD BE HEARD. AND TO BUDGET PROCESS AND THE BUDGET COMMITTEE AS WELL AS A FULL LEGISLATURE. OR OTHER PROCESS THAT CAN BE USED AS WELL FOR EXAMPLE SUMMARY OR IS IN THE PAST HAVE GONE THROUGH A GOVERNOR'S WE ARE PROCESS. COURSE THAT WOULD ALSO GO THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE SO THE LEGISLATURE HAS A REALLY IMPORTANT ROLE IN CONSIDERING THESE PROPOSALS AND DECIDING WHETHER THEY'RE CUT WHETHER THE LEGISLATURE'S COMFORTABLE WITH THE PROPOSAL OR WANT TO MAKE CHANGES. I'M WHATEVER IT PROCESSES USED WE THINK THAT'S REALLY CRITICAL AND THAT'S WHY WE RECOMMEND THAT THE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION PROVIDE DETAILS SOONER RATHER THAN. LATER WE THINK THAT'LL MORE TIME. I'M IN AN ARTS. YOU KNOW WHEN PROPOSALS FOR COME. YOU KNOW I'VE MAYOR OF. WHICH SOMETIMES THEY DO. I'M A CAN IT LEAVES VERY LITTLE TIME FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO ASSESS THOSE PROPOSALS- BECAUSE THERE'S JUST ESPECIALLY WITH THAT THE DEADLINES THAT THE LEGISLATURE'S UNDER IT- IN PRACTICE IT IT. DOESN'T GIVE A LOT OF TIME FOR CONSIDERATION SO WE THINK THAT IF THAT PROPOSALS COULD COME IN. EARLIER THAN NOT THAT WOULD THAT WOULD BE BENEFICIAL TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A ROBUST CONVERSATION. IT'S WILL FOLLOW UP COME HAVE YOU CONSIDERED. LOOKING AT HE- MOVING THE RETAIL TAX TO DISTRIBUTION INSTEAD. APPOINT A CELLS IS PROPOSED BY THE ADMINISTRATION. US SO- FOR THE DECEMBER REPORT THAT- THAT MY COLLEAGUE HAS REFERRED TO WE EXAMINE WE SERVE. THOUGHT ABOUT POTENTIAL CHANGES TO- CANNABIS THE STATE'S CAMPUS EXCISE TAXES IS SORT OF A THREE STEP PROCESS FIRST CHOOSING WHAT TYPE OF TAX OR TAXES TO LET THE SECOND. CHOOSING HOW TO COLLECT THEM IN THIRD DETERMINING THE RATE AND SO- WE DID CONSIDER FOR EACH TYPE OF TAX THAT WE LOOKED AT IN THE REPORT WE CONSIDERED- SEVERAL DIFFERENT POSSIBLE POINTS OF COLLECTION INCLUDING- THE FINAL DISTRIBUTION AND AS WELL AS AS THE RETAILER- SO ULTIMATELY WE FOR A POTENCY BASED TAX WE THINK THAT EITHER THE FINAL DISTRIBUTION OR- RETAILER COULD BE A REASONABLE POINT OF COLLECTION BUT FOR PRICE BASED TAXES. ALSO KNOWN AS AT VALOREM TAXES WHETHER THAT'S LIKE THE CURRENT RETAIL EXCISE TAX WE HAVE OR SOME- ALTERNATIVE THAT COULD BE AT LAST DISTRIBUTION. IN THOSE SCENARIOS- WE DID RECOMMEND- COLLECTING THOSE AT THE RETAIL LEVEL- AND THE REASON WAS SOME OF THE REASONS FOR THAT ARE AT TAX ADMINISTRATION FORCED AND IT HELPFUL TO HAVE TAXPAYERS THAT PLAY A CONSISTENT ROLE IN APPLY CHAIN ARE READILY IDENTIFIABLE INVISIBLE BOTH TO TAP MINISTERS IN PUBLIC. AND ALSO HAVE AN ESTABLISHED RELATIONSHIP WITH TAX MR LIKE. HAVE. TFA THREE DOES FOR EXAMPLE. THANK YOU QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE. THANK YOU VERY. LESS UNDER OUR PANEL. LET'S GO TO POLLS LOOKING FOR ALL THE OF REGULAR RESPECT FROM KERN LICENSING AGES. COULD COUNT APARTMENT OF FINANCE I'LL PROVIDE A QUICK OVERVIEW- OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S PLANS TO CONSOLIDATE THE THREE CANNABIS LICENSING ENTITIES INTO A SINGLE DEPARTMENT. HAD LAST MONTH IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSED ITS PLAN TO CONSOLIDATE CANNABIS REGULATORY FUNCTIONS IN THE BUREAU CANNABIS CONTROL DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE INTO A SINGLE DEPARTMENT OF CANADA'S CONTROL UNDER THE BUSINESS CONSUMER SERVICES HOUSING AGENCY BY JULY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AS YOU ALL ARE THERE ESTABLISHING A LEAVE CAMPUS MARKETING REGULATORY AND MARK HAS REQUIRED US TO LEARN IN OF ALL OF OVER TIME THANKS TO THE INCREDIBLE WORK DONE TODAY WE HAVE MADE TREMENDOUS PROGRESS. READING A CONSOLIDATED DEPARTMENT AS THE NEXT STEP IN THIS EVOLUTION THE OVER ARCHING GOALS OF THE CONSOLIDATION IS TO SIMPLIFY AND CENTRALIZED THE CAMPUS REGULATORY STRUCTURE TO MAKE IT SIMPLER AND MORE TRANSPARENT AND MORE EFFECTIVE TO LEGALLY AND SAFELY OPERATE OUT OF THIS BUSINESS AND SECOND WE WANT TO MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT AND COSTLY TO PARTICIPATE. IN THIS INDUSTRY TO MORE OF. SMITH THE WORK. AND EIGHT AND WE CREATED GROUP'S DEMAND AS AN ADDRESS VARIOUS OF THE CONSOLE THESE INCLUDE STAFF CHANGES A TV GROUP COMPLY AND FORCE. LICENSING AND REYES. I. T. RE BY INTO SERVE IN SO. THESE ARE MEETING WEEKLY MY TIME A WEEK TO MAKE SURE THE CONSOLIDATION IS EXCEPT A SUCCESS WE'RE ALSO IN THE PROCESS OF HIRING A PROJECT MANAGER TO GUIDE THE OVERALL CONSOLIDATION AFTER- LEVERAGING BEST PRACTICES FROM PRIOR RE ORGANIZATIONS. OUR WORKING GROUPS ARE PRIORITIZING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE STATUTORY CHANGES IN THE BUDGET TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE- PROPOSALS FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER THIS SPRING. AND WE HAVE A SHARED INTEREST IN MAKING SURE YOU ALL HAVE TIME TO REVIEW IT AS WELL BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S A THOROUGH PROPOSAL. A COUPLE OF NOTES ABOUT. BUDGET PROPOSAL YOU'RE LIKELY TO RECEIVE THIS SPRING REGARDLESS OF THE CONSOLIDATION THAT THREE PROGRAMS WOULD HAVE SUBMITTED BCP'S TO CONTINUE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF LIMITED TERM RESOURCES. TO ILLUSTRATE THAT AN EXAMPLE IS IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THE TOTAL BUDGET FOR ALL THREE LICENSING ENTITIES IN NINETEEN TWENTY IS A HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS. IF YOU LOOK AT THAT AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE BE THE LIMITED TERM FUNDING IT'S FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS. SO THERE IS GOING TO BE A SIGNIFICANT BC P. REGARDLESS OF THE CONSOLIDATION SO WHEN YOU SEE THE BUDGET PROPOSAL THE SIX SPRING EXPECT FOR. LARGE DOLLAR TIED IT NOT SO MUCH THE SOLID ATION AFTER BUT TO PRIOR WHEN TERM FUNDING. TO MISSION YOU SIZE GAFFER WINNIE TO BE CONSCIOUS THAT THE OF LIFE ARE EXPECTED GROW OVER THE YEAR AS THE MARKET MATURES SO COSTS WILL LIKELY GO IN THOSE YEARS AGAIN SOMETHING NOT RELATED CONSOLIDATION BUT WE'LL HAVE TO A FACTOR OPTICS OF GROWTH- THAT CONCLUDES MY COMMENTS AND AFTER MY COLLEAGUES TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY SPEAKING HAPPENING ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS.

I JUST RECENTLY THE BUREAU ADOPTED EMERGENCY REGULATIONS REQUIRING STOREFRONT RETAILERS TO POST THEIR QUICK RESPONSE OR Q. R. CODE. CERTIFICATE IN STORE FRONT WINDOWS AND FOR CANNABIS DELIVERY AND TRANSPORTATION DRIVERS TO CARRY IT WITH THEM. THE REGULATIONS WERE DESIGNED TO HELP CONSUMERS IDENTIFY LICENSE CANNABIS RETAIL STORES ASSIST LAW ENFORCEMENT AND SUPPORT THE LEGAL CANNABIS MARKET WHERE PRODUCTS SUCH AS FEET PRODUCTS. FATE CARTRIDGES ARE ROUTINELY TESTED TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY. THE REGULATIONS REQUIRE LICENSE RETAILER TO POST THEIR UNIQUE Q. R. CODE IN STORE FRONT WINDOWS OR NEAR INTEREST ENTRANCE. TO EDUCATE THE COULD. BE IMPORTANT FORTY AND PER PURCHASING PRODUCTS FROM THE LEGAL MARKET. CONSUMERS CAN USE THEIR SMARTPHONE CAMERA TO SCAN THE QR CODE WHICH AUTOMATICALLY LINKS TO THE BUREAU'S ONLINE LICENSE SEARCH AND CONFIRMS THE CANNABIS RETAILERS LICENSE STATUS THE Q. R.

IN CLOSING I WANT TO PROVIDE YOU WITH A BRIEF UPDATE ON THE LOCAL EQUITY GRANT PROGRAM AS MOST OF YOU KNOW THE CALIFORNIA CANNABIS EQUITY ACT OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN A STAB LIST BY SENATE BILL TWELVE NINETY FOUR AND THE BUDGET ACT OF TWENTY NINETEEN. CREATED TEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE ROAD TO FIND GRANT LOCAL EQUITY PROGRAM. THE EQUITY FUNDING PROVIDED FOR ASSISTANCE TO LOCAL JURISDICTIONS COMMERCIAL CANNABIS EQUITY PROGRAMS THAT PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO LOCAL EQUITY OUT. OR LOCAL EQUITY LICENSEES. ON OCTOBER NINTH TWENTY NINETEEN THE BUREAU ANNOUNCED IT AWARDED TEN MILLION TO TEN LOCAL JURISDICTIONS.

AT IN THE BUREAU HAS AS- A HIGHER STAFF THAT WILL BE A RESOURCE FOR AND PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO EQUITY APPLICANTS AND LOCAL EQUITY PROGRAM SENATE IS AND THAT CONCLUDES MY TEMP MY TESTIMONY THANK YOU. FOR YOU. IN THE FACE WITH A MARKET. I DON'T KNOW THAT IT'S GONNA CHANGE ANYTHING ON WHAT THE LEGAL MARKET IS CURRENTLY DOING I DO THINK CONSOLIDATION MAKES US MORE EFFECTIVE WHEN IT COMES pBY YOU CAN SEE THE DATING ON WHAT. ABOUT SEIZURES THROUGH A NUMBER OF ABOUT THE- FOR THE VAPE PENS THE CARTRIDGES YOU GUYS SEE SOME THE CARTRIDGES YOU SEE THAT JUST I JUST AROUND EIGHTEEN THOUSAND THAT WAS IN THIS YEAR AND TWENTY INTO ONLY YEAH THIS. FISCAL YEAR WHAT'S YOUR NUMBER. PART IS BEEN SOLD. NINETY GUYS YOU GUYS TRACK AND TRACE YOU EURO YOU'RE THOSE NUMBERS TO WRITE FOR THE LEGAL MARKET NOW THAT WE'VE GOT FOLKS ON TRACK AND TRACE WE CAN PROP AND I WOULD I WOULD DEFER TO RICHER PARROTT FROM. IF WE HAVE THAT INFORMATION AVAILABLE ON HOW MANY CARTILAGES OUR GOAL I WAS WONDERING IF WE SOLD TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND CARDS AS WE SEE IT TELL. VERY HARD TO AGE. AND I GUESS MOREOVER DOES ABOUT THE F. TO. EXIST TO COORDINATE- ENFORCED NEGATIVITY'S BETWEEN STATE LAW JURIST. HOW'S THAT GOING. IT'S IS GOING WELL- WE COORDINATED WITH THAT BIG- THAT BIG MAJOR OPERATION WITH THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES- AND THEY'RE THE ONES HO ASSISTED US WITH SERVING OVER HALF OF THOSE FIVE. MORE HOW MAY BE. AGENTS DO YOU HAVE THAT ARE THERE PIECE OFF. IN YOUR BUREAU. SEE YOU- CURRENTLY HAS FIFTY THREE STAFF I DON'T BELIEVE ALL OF THEM ARE ON SOME OF THAT SITE MINISTRY OF STAFF RIGHT. YEAH BUT THAT'S THAT'S THE NUMBER OF THAT STAFF RIGHT. CANNABIS AND FORCED ME UNIT SO YES WILL BE JENNER'S AND EVEN I GIVE YOU FORTY JUST TO CONDUCT AN OPERATION OF THIS SIZE AND STATURE- YOU GUYS DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES. TO CONDUCT THE OPERATIONS ON YOUR OWN IS THAT CORRECT. WHEN YOU SEE ON OUR OWN- SO THE BUREAU UTILIZES BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE SWORN PEACE OFFICERS WITHIN THE BUREAU WE UTILIZE NON SWORN INVESTIGATORS TO DO THE ADMINISTRA FOR THE LICENSEES AND THEN WE REFER ARE. BUT OUR CRIMINAL COMPLAINTS CO BUT THAT'S FOR LICENSEE SO FOR THE ILLICIT MARKET THOSE INVESTIGATIONS OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE USING SWORN PERSONNEL NOT INVESTIGATOR SO I'M SOME WIDE DRILL DOWN DEEPER. INTO HOW MANY INVESTIGATION YOU HAVE. IS NOT A VERY BIG UNIT. TO INTO THOSE TYPE OF FOR SOME OPERATIONS. I GUESS ONE COULD CONCLUDE THAT THERE THE ENFORCEMENT ON LISTEN MARKET IS VERY LIGHT. WHAT IS OR WHERE THOSE US COORDINATING WITH THE LOCAL JURISDICTION BECOMES IMPERATIVE- TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE PARTNERING UP WITH THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO ATTACK THE ILLEGAL MARKET AND THAT'S WITH THE EXPERTISE IS BASED NOT WITH YOUR AGENCY. A LOT OF OPERATIONS. I'M NOT SURE I UNDERSTAND YOUR QUESTION. TO THOSE INVESTIGATIONS YES THE EXPERTISE IS PRIMARILY IN THOSE. LOCAL AGENCIES THAT HAVE THE EXPERTISE IN ILLICIT IN OUR IN OUR CONTACTS PERIOD WAY SO THAT WAS REALLY EXPERTISE LIES VERSES LYING WITH CANNABIS CONTROL OR EVEN DOJ FOR THAT MATTER. CORRECT I MEAN OBVIOUSLY OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS THE STAFF AT SEE YOU OF DEVELOPED. A LOT OF EXPERTISE WHEN IT COMES TO- CANNABIS ENFORCEMENT SO I WOULD SAY IT IT IS ON BOTH SIDES BELOW THAT X. IS THAT THAT'S MORE THE LICENSING PART BEEN SAVING FOUR PART. WITH THE AND I'M DONE JUNE DOWN THE LIVE MARKET SPECIFICALLY ON THAT. THAT THAT'S REALLY THE BIG A HUNDRED POUND GORILLA IN THE ROOM IS LISTEN MARKET. SO. IT IS SOMEONE I SPENT TEN YEARS NARCOTICS. THE EXPERTISE LIES THE LOCAL LEVEL IT IS NEVER. IN THE STATE LEVEL OF ANY SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT EVER. SO I GUESS DEFICIT IF WE'RE REALLY GOING TO ATTACK THE LIST OF MARKET. LOCALS HAVE TO PLAY LEGAL PART OF IT BECAUSE THE STATE CAN'T PLAY WHEN HE HAD TO BE OUT BE ANY FOR DOJ. THAT WAS LIMITED THEY RELIED ON LOCALS HEAVILY. SO IT'S SO IT'S ALWAYS BEEN THAT WAY WITH THESTATE AND LIKE I SAID YOU CAN GO LOOK AT THE EXPERTISE. TECHNICALS INVESTIGATION WITH THE MARKET WELL YOU'RE FOLLOWING SOMEONE DOING SURVEILLANCE- MAKING PURCHASES. YOU NEED THOSE FOLKS DOING THIS OTHERWISE. THE DENTURE MAKING THE LISTEN MARKET IS INELIGIBLE. HI I JUST WANNA MAKE ONE POINT A TO DO THINK THAT- THROUGH SOME OF THE LISTENING SESSIONS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION DID WITH LOCALS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND IT OUT TO THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES DO YOU SEE AS A PARTNERSHIP IN A LOT OF WAYS BECAUSE- THERE ARE THINGS THAT ARE THAT THEY LACKED CLARITY ON AND I THINK THE- SORT OF HEALTH. NEXT YOU KNOW MAYBE SOMEONE WHO IS OPERATE IN THE GRAY AREA TODAY AND THEY'RE NOT SURE WHETHER THEY SHOULD OR SHOULDN'T FORCE WITH SO THEY CERTAINLY DEFINITELY HAVE AN IMPORTANT ROLE SO MAKING SURE THAT WE KNOW WHO IS A LIST SAY WHO IS LICENSED WHO AND HOW WE SORT OF MOVED THAT NEEDLE SORT OF MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE WE'RE PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES TO LICENSURE IN ADDITION TO ENFORCING THE REAL BAD ACTORS BECAUSE THE SYSTEM IS SO SCREWED UP RIGHT NOW SO AMBIGUOUS NO IT DOESN'T. THERE ARE OTHER. THEY MADE CAN JUMP IN WITH. CANNABIS CONTROL BUT AS FAR AS THOSE AGENCIES DOING THEIR OWN OPERATION. YOU BE HARD PRESSED TO TELL ME AN AGENCY THAT'S DONE IT'S IN THIS CAN AMOUNT OF OPERATIONS ON THE ILLICIT MARKET. BECAUSE IT'S NOT IT'S NOT BEING DONE. SO IT'S NOT THAT'S AFFECT. JUST A FEW MORE QUESTIONS- DO LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE SAID THAT ONE HOW DO I THINK AUTHORITIES AND FORCE AGAINST ILLICIT OPERATORS AND LICENSE OPERATORS. MESSAGE X. HOW THE LICENSING AUTHORITIES AND FORCE AGAINST ILLICIT OPERATORS AND LICENSE OPERATORS SO- SO ALL THREE OF US WORK TOGETHER WHEN IT COMES TO LICENSE OPERATORS- WE ALL HAVE STAFF THAT CONDUCT INSPECTIONS INSPECTIONS MAKE SURE THEY'RE COMPLYING LAW ON IF THEY DON'T WE COORDINATING THEIR IT TAKES ACTION THE LOT WE HAVE ABILITY. TO PROVIDE NOTICE TO COMPLY GIVE THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE IF IT'S SOMETHING MUCH SERIES WE CAN SET FINE. AND THAT IN SOME OF OUR LIFE HE'S- OUR VERTICALLY IN A THE THREE OF US WERE TOGETHER ARE ENFORCEMENT TEAMS WERE EITHER- TO DO THAT- AS IT RELATES TO UNLICENSED COMPLAINTS- WE DO TRY TO GET COMPLY ANSWER FIRST WE ALWAYS WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE LETTING PEOPLE HEY. A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT. FIRST THAT WE BASICALLY TRIAGE THESE COMPLAINTS BY MAKING DOING IN A OF THE BUREAU DOES THEIR FIRST INVESTIGATION WERE MAKING SURE THAT I COMPLAIN IS VALID WE NOTIFY THAT- UNLICENSED OPERATOR THAT. THEY'RE OPERATING ILLEGALLY AND THEY NEED THIS PIECE OR BECOME LICENSED- IF THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN AND WE REFER THAT TO THE CANNABIS ENFORCEMENT UNIT AND THEN THERE THEY WORK WITH. JURISDICTIONS UP TO. THAT THERE ARE ALSO WENT UNDERCOVER BUYS AND THEN SERVING SEARCH WARRANTS ON THOSE THAT ILLEGAL ACTIVITY IT WAS THE BACKLOG. I DON'T HAVE THAT NUMBER WITH ME RIGHT NOW YOU KNOW THE COMPLETE YOU GUYS HAVE I THINK WE'VE REFERRED CLOSE TO TWENTY THREE HUNDRED TO THE CANNABIS ENFORCEMENT YOU AT OF TWO FROM INCEPTION OF OUR RAM IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND THEIR MUSCLES CAN. THIS TO GET. MOST CASES THE WE HAVE I DON'T HAVE THAT EXACT NUMBER WITH ME BUT I CAN CERTAINLY GET THAT INFORMATION FOR YOU PLEASE WITH THIS IN STRIDE THAT SO IT'S SO HERE GOES AGAIN TO THE ACCOUNT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT FOR. CONDUCT WAS OPERATIONS CORRECT. THAT IS IN FORCE UNIT DOES A OF THOSE INVESTIGATIONS THAT WERE FOURTEEN TWO OF THEM THEY ARE CONDUCTING SURVEILLANCE UNDER COVER ACTIVITY IN MOST CASES- GETTING THE SEARCH WARRANTS WITH THE LAST ONE WE DID WITH THE CITY OF LA IT WAS SPLIT BETWEEN THE TWO AGENCIES TO GET THAT FORTY FIVE OF WHEAT I THINK FORTY FIVE SEARCH WARRANT OF THREE DAY PERIOD. GOING ON IN. THEY DO. COULD YOU SEE A ON THERE YES THEY AND THEY WERE WITH COULD YOU'RE GOOD YOUR AGENCY HAVE DONE IT ON THEIR OWN BY THEMSELVES. IN THE END JUST THE BUREAU ITSELF WE DON'T WE DON'T HAVE SWORN OFFICERS SO WE HAVE TO RELY ON DIVISION INVESTIGATIONS ARE CANNABIS FOR FORCED ME UNIT TO DO THOSE INVESTIGATIONS BUT YES THEY COULD DO IT ON THEIR OWN. INVESTIGATION INTO ON THEIR OWN YES HOW MANY HOUSES DO THEY HAVE SWORN OFFICERS. THEY CURRENTLY HAVE FIFTY THREE- STAFF RIGHT NOW AND NOT ALL THOSE WRIST WORN OFF. YEAH I DON'T HAVE THAT BREAKDOWN OF HOW MANY SWORN BUT ALTHOUGH A MAJORITY OF THEM ARE SWORN ALSO IS FOR YOU. TO DO FORTY FIVE SEARCH WARRANTS. YOU DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO DO THAT TO SERVE WILL CIRCLE SEARCH WARRANTS. YOU DON'T YOU DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES PERIOD. THIS LOW. THIS IS THE NIGHT OKAY HANDSOMELY ALONG THOSE LINES WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE PARTNERING WITH YOU TO HELP A SET YOU UP FOR SUCCESS AND SO I THINK SIMILARLY- WHAT MIGHT WE HELP ASSIST YOU WITH AN INSURANCE YOU HAVE THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE REALITIES THAT WERE DEALT WITH AND BECAUSE I THINK WE YOUR HEARING IS SIGNIFICANT STRAIGHT I TO. OUR QUIPPED BUT THE MAGNITUDE SO VAST THAT WE ARE NOT ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE THIS AND IF JUST FOLLOW HE LET'S THAT TO WHICH HE THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL WHICH IS IN MAY THERE'S REST OF ALONG WITH THE WITH THE- STATION OF. WHAT DO YOU NEED. THAT WE CAN IN THE CLIP YOU TO BE SIX. AS THAT WE CAN ACCOMMODATE SOME THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN OUTLINED. AND I. UNDERSTAND THE NEED TO FOR YOU TO ENGAGE WITH THE BUDGET PROCESS- PRIOR TO MAY SO WE CAN IDENTIFY THOSE AREAS WHERE WE MIGHT NEED ASSISTANCE. YEAH I THINK THE ONLY OTHER THING I WOULD POINT OUT IS THAT- IN STANDING UP ALL THE SORT OF CANNABIS REGULATORY PROGRAMS HAS BEEN A PROCESS AS I THINK MANY OF YOU UP THERE WHERE FEELING INVESTIGATED DECISIONS IS QUITE A PROCESS IN ITSELF- AND EACH YEAR WE'VE- GOT THIS ISSUE IN LOOKING AT. OUR ABILITY TO REASONABLY COME FOR AND MAKE A REQUEST FOR STAFF GIVEN THE NUMBER OF POSITIONS WE FILL TO DATE- AGAIN SO WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT AS WE GO INTO CONSOLIDATION TO SEE WHAT COULD REASONABLY JUSTIFY. I THINK THE OTHER THING BUT WE HAVE ABOUT WHEN WE'RE THINKING ABOUT FORCED IN IS A PROCESS IN ABILITY. ABOUT YOU KNOW I MEAN TO PUT THOUSAND. OAKS OUT THERE TODAY TO DOWN LIST ARE LADY NEEDED A YEAR FROM NOW. AND THE- WAS AT COST TO THE V. PAIRS. THERE ARE THERE ARE THERE A LOT OF COMPLICATED FACTORS IN ADDITION OTHER LIFE. OP WITHIN A JURY. YES NOT A SIMPLE OF THE ISSUE I THANK EACH YEAR YOU AND I AM I DON'T THINK WHICH I'M TRYING TO MINIMIZE IT BUT I WAS JUST SORT. THE CALL PATIENTS. ARE ABOUT. WHEN THEY COME FOR WIN. JUST THE NEED THAT WE HAVE HEARD THE BILL FELL INTO. THAT AND ALSO SORT OF LOOKING AT WHAT CAN WE STAND THAT'S THE AMOUNT ON. ALSO CUT. BUT I THINK WITH THE- IN THE DESK. THIS CAN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE OF THIS. DE COME FROM THE ILLICIT MARKET. THIS MAY ALL. AND THIS ABOUT PUBLIC EXPECT THAT GOVERNMENT US FOR THE PEER DO SOMETHING IN RIGHT NOW WE NOT DOING THAT WOULD ALSO AND ALSO THE NEW IS NOT MUCH IN NEW WAS BEFORE AND WE'RE STILL NOT DOING ANYTHING IS STILL ISSUE CAN HAPPEN ISSUE AND THEY'RE SCARED THAT'S WITH NOT DOING AS MUCH BUT WE STILL HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO DO SO WITH THAT YEAH RESOURCE THEY HAVEN'T. NOW WE'RE MORE. SEE IN THE OTHER THAT'S WILL BE BEING IS TO UNDER ONE ROOF. BUT STILL YOU NEED THE PARTLY WHY THERE'S NO REASON TO COME OUT OF THE DARK AND KEEP SELLING BECAUSE THAT THE PENALTY. VISIBLE YOU'RE FINE SIMULATOR EARLIER YOU KNOW LISTEN MARKET STOP IT CHANGE IT GET BETTER SEE A BUNCH OF LETTERS BUT FROM DAIS IN A LETTER. UNTIL SOMETHING ON. THE BIG LAG TIME. SO IT'S WORTH IT IN A BUSINESS SENSE TO KEEP WHILE BEING. LAW BECAUSE IF. YOU MAKING A TON OF MONEY. AND THE RISK IS VERY LOW. BECAUSE IT IS THE ONLY CASES THAT'S WE WERE DOWN TO SO WE NEED THE PROBLEM WITH THE VAPING PART. AND THE INDUSTRY WANTS TO GET RID OF BAD ACTORS TO. THEY'RE PAYING TAXES FOR THIS. SO WE'RE SEEING OUR HANSEL. WHEN WE GO TO HEAD TOWARD NEXT TO- OTHER PANELIST HEAR FROM THEM. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRS AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS- THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT TODAY.

CFA IS ALSO PARTICIPATED IN FOCUSED OPERATIONS WITH THE CALIFORNIA NATIONAL GUARD EFFORTS TO SUPPORT LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES IN MULTIPLE DAY MULTIPLE WEREN'T OPERATIONS TARGETING. ILLEGAL COMMERCIAL CANNABIS CULTIVATION. WITH pREGARD TO TRACK AND TRACE CFA IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ADMINISTRATION OF THE STATE'S TRACK INTERESTPROGRAM THAT USED BY ALL COMMERCIAL CANNABIS LICENSEES BOTH PROVISIONAL AND ANNUAL LICENSEES. THE SYSTEM IS USED TO ENSURE THAT ALL MOVEMENT OF CANNABIS IN CANNABIS PRODUCTS IS ACCOUNTED FOR. IT SERVES AS A RECEPTACLE FOR AND RECORD RETENTION FOR ALL LAB TEST RESULTS AND ALLOWS FOR TRACKING A PRODUCT IN THE EVENT OF A PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUE. RIGHT NOW WE HAVE ABOUT A TWO HUNDRED CREDENTIALS USED CREDENTIALED USERS ACROSS THE STATE OUT OF EIGHTY FIVE HUNDRED LICENSEES THERE ARE PEOPLE CONTINUING TO GET CREDENTIALED EVERY DAY- ANY LICENSEE THAT DOES. GET CREDENTIALED FACES POTENTIAL FINES AND OR EXPANSION OF THEIR LICENSE- WE CONDUCT SOME ACTIVITIES TOWARD THE END OF LAST YEAR. ACTUALLY SUSPENDED LICENSE ACROSS ALL THREE AGENCIES. SOME THINGS ON THE REASON FOR DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE WE'RE CURRENTLY WORKING ON TO REGULATION PACKAGES ONE IS FERN APPELLATIONS OF ORIGIN PROGRAM THAT'S- BY STATUTE REQUIRED TO BE IN PLACE BY JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THAT WAS RELEASED LAST WEEK AND AS WE ARE CURRENTLY IN THE FORTY FIVE DAY PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD. SOON TO FOLLOW WILL BE A REGULATION PACKAGE TO CREATE A- COMPARABLE ORGANIC PROGRAM FOR CANNABIS THAT'S COMPARABLE TO THE NATIONAL ORGANIC PROGRAM. PROGRAM AS WELL TO BE IMPLEMENTED BY JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE. FINALLY WE ARE WE WILL BE AND BARKING ON AN INDUSTRY AWARENESS CAMPAIGN SOON- THAT'S- ALMOST LIKE A COMPLIMENT TO THE PIER IS CAMPAIGN ABOUT THE PUBLIC CONSUMERS- BUYING FROM- LEGAL- LICENSE CANNABIS SHOPS OURS WILL BE TO ENCOURAGE OF THE- UNLICENSED GROWERS TO COME INTO THE MARKET TO WILL BE WORKING ON THAT INDUSTRY AWARENESS CAMPAIGN IN THE COMING MONTHS- THAT CONCLUDES MY UPDATE I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. DO LOCAL HAVE ACCESS TO TRACK AND TRACE. LOCALS A LOCAL GOVERNMENTS DO BY STATUTE AND WE'RE ACTUALLY WORKING ON A PILOT PROJECT WITH ABOUT THREE COUNTIES RIGHT NOW. TESTING OUT SOME DATA GETTING SOME FEEDBACK- AND SEEING HOW THAT GOES SO THAT WE CAN THEN. SEE HOW SEE WHAT WHAT THEY'RE REALLY NEED FOR THAT DATA AND THEN OVER IT UP TO OTHER COUNTY SO WE ARE ENGAGED IN. CAR CONVERSATIONS AND MEETINGS WITH THREE COUNTIES RIGHT NOW. THE FIRST. THIS WEEK'S YES THANK YOU FOR THE THREE- LICENSING AGENCIES- HOW MANY PERMANENT LICENSE HAVE YOU GIVEN AND WHAT IS PERCENT VERSUS YOUR PENDING OR YOUR FOLKS THAT ARE WAITING FOR PERMANENT SENSES I'M FOR THE BUSINESSES- AND THEN OF THE FOLKS THAT HAVE PERMANENT LICENSES THREE AGENCIES WITH THE CONSOLIDATION PROCESS. WHAT HAPPENS TO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS SURVEY. FINE. THE LIST OF- SO WE HAVE. SO WHEN YU SAY PERMANENT ARE YOU REFERRING TO ANNUAL BECAUSE WE HAVE ANNUAL OR PROVISIONAL THERE'S NO MORE TEMPORARY LICENSE ANNUALS SO SEVEN HUNDRED ANNUAL IS FORTY TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY PROVISIONALS- WE HAVE ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED APPLICATIONS THAT ARE OUT WAITED APPLICANTS TO GIVE US MORE INFORMATION SO I CAN RUN THE PERCENTAGES BUT IF WE WERE BEING AROUND 20% GETTING ANNUAL AS THE REST GETTING REGIONALS AND I. I'M EVEN WITH THE CONSOLIDATION I DON'T ANYONE WOULD TO REUP WHY CERTAIN GRANDFATHER'S THERE ARE PEOPLE THERE ALL AND THEY'RE ALL TWELVE MONTH LIFE. ONE TRACKS WILL WERE. WE'LL HAVE PRETTY TO READ THOSE LIGHT BROTHER PROVISIONAL OR AN ANNUAL AND SO CASES. WERE ALSO CAN PER STATE IT WAS ONE CALL. WISELY FOR THE- BUT IT SEEMS LIKE A VERY HIGH NUMBER PROVISIONALS FOR SPEAKING FOR THE CDFA. IT'S MAINLY SEQUEL- ISSUES AT THE- IN THE VARIOUS COUNTIES WHERE THE APPLICANTS OR THEIR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AREN'T QUITE COMPLETE WITH THEIR SEQUEL PROCESS AND UNTIL THAT TIME WERE NOT ABLE TO ISSUE AN ANNUAL LICENSE SO CLOSE LONG THEY KEEP RENEWING EVERY YEAR THE- EXTENDED. FOR EVER AND IS THAT PROVISIONAL OF SUNSETS IN- AT THE END OF WENTY TWENTY TWO. BECAUSE SOMETIMES SICK WITH ISSUES MIGHT TAKE FOR FIVE YEARS ONE IS HUESO. OKAY SO JUST OKAY. FOR PUBLIC HEALTH SIR TOTAL LICENSE NUMBER IS A NINE HUNDRED NINETY ONE MANUFACTURING CANNABIS LICENSES SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY EIGHT OF PROFESSIONALS TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE OUR ANIMALS- WE CURRENTLY HAVE NINE THAT WE HAVE APPROVED THERE PENDING PAYMENT WE HAVE A HUNDRED AND FORTY SIX OCCASIONAL UPPER REVIEW PRIME. AND THE RECENT ALSO THE HIGH NUMBER OF PROFESSIONALS IS BECAUSE MANY OF THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE STILL FINALIZING THE LOCAL ORDINANCES SO UNTIL FINALIZED AS LOCAL ORDINANCES LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WOULD NOT APPROVE. THE APPLICANTS FOR AN ANNUAL LICENSE SAR OPTION WAS TO GIVE THEM A PROVISIONAL ALL OF THESE ARE- TWELVE MONTHS LICENSES AND WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF. MOST OF OUR RENEWALS ARE STARTING THIS MONTH IN MARCH APRIL AND MAY AND ALL OF THOSE ONCE THEIR RENEWED TO THE NEW DEPARTMENT AND THEY WERE JUST TRYING. YOUR FOR THE BUREAU LIMóN OF OUR LICENSES ARE PROFESSIONALS- WE'RE AT ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE ANNUALS IN THE NICK AND WE'VE ISSUED JUST I THINK TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED AND ONE LICENSE- FOR US- IN SEQUEL- BUT IT'S ALSO FOR LIKE OUR RETAILERS BECAUSE THEY'RE- THERE ARE A LOT OF THEM ARE STILL. GOING THROUGH LIKE- PUBLIC COLE SAYS ARE GOING TO THE LOCAL PROCESS THEY MAY HAVE TO GO THROUGH BUILDING AND PLANNING THEY MAY HAVE TO GET A CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT. SO A LOT OF THOSE ARE STE THE LOCALS HAVE GIVEN APPROVAL FOR THAT PROVISIONAL BUT THEY- HAVEN'T FOR THE LOCAL PROCESS WE DON'T HAVE APPROVAL TO ISSUE THAT. ANNUAL SO. I THINK WORDS OVER. JUST UNDER HUNDRED PENDINE BUT- A LOT THAT THAT EBBS AND FLOWS WE WERE ABLE IF WE GET- TO GET FOLKS INTO PROVISIONAL FAIRLY QUICKLY WITHIN A COUPLE. ONCE THEY APPLY FOR A LICENSE- AS LONG AS THEY- QUALIFY. THANK YOU. LET'S LOOK. SELECT THE- YEAH I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY. A COUPLE THINGS FIRST OF ALL I'M THRILLED ABOUT THE CONSOLIDATION BECAUSE IT'S A WELCOME LOGICAL ADJUSTMENT THE NEEDS TO TAKE PLACE AND I THINK IT'S GOING TO HELP THE CHALLENGE THAT WE FACE. THE MONSTER THAT WE ARE TRYING TO TACKLE IS THE- THE COMPETITION TO LEGAL MARKET. UNFORTUNATELY WE LIKE NOR THEIR STATE HAVE A BIG DISADVANTAGE BECAUSE BASICALLY FOR TWENTY YEARS WE HAD A MARGINAL MARKET AND WE HAD A MARKET THAT ALLOWED PEOPLE TO. SKATE A KIND OF A CONSEQUENCE AND SO WHEN WE ADOPTED THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK OR WHEN WE AND HAVE ATTEMPTED TO ADOPT THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK THE ONLY WAY. YOU'RE ABLE TO COMPETE IN THAT NEW SPACE. AS IF YOU HAVE SOME STICK I KNOW IT DOESN'T MAKE ANYBODY FEEL GOOD IN HERE BUT IT'S FACT AND THE END OF THE STICK THAT WE HAVE IS NOT INCARCERATION IT'S MONEY. AND WHAT WE HAVE TO HAVE IS IN A FORCE AND ORGANIZED A PARTNERING AS- THE CHAIR WAS TALKING ABOUT USING LOCAL RESOURCES. THEY'RE GOOD THEY KNOW HOW TO GET IT DONE BUT THE PROBLEM IS TO. IS THE ENFORCEMENT IS CIVIL VERSUS CRIMINAL AND MOST LAW ENFORCEMENT DON'T. AREN'T COMFORTABLE IN THE CIVIL SPACE. AND SO THAT'S PART OF THE FRUSTRATION AND IT WE NEED TO FIGURE THIS OUT. BECAUSE IF WE DON'T. IT'S NOT GOING TO CHANGE. AND I DON'T THINK WE CAN TO STAY IN A LEGAL MARKET UNLESS WE'RE HAVING- BUST AND I MEAN BUST ENFORCEMENT EFFORT- L. IT'S BEEN. VERY VERY FIRST BUT THE COMPLY. IT'S VERY VERY DIFFICULT COMPLEX. NOT SO MUCH. IN THE ILLICIT MARKET AND I CAN TELL YOU THIS IS HOW BAD IT IS FOLKS I MEAN I COME FROM A DISTRICT THAT HAS. SOME PRETTY RURAL CIRCUMSTANCES I HAVE WHAT COMMUNITY ALL I'M NOT GONNA MENTION THEIR NAMES. BUT THEY HAVE OVER TEN DISPENSED REASON THEY'RE NOT EVEN A TEN THOUSAND- POPULATION IN THEIR COMMUNITY. DOES PEOPLE ARE NOT AFRAID OF RUNNING THEIR BUSINESS. AND IT'S A SHAME ANOTHER- PART OF MY DISTRICT WHICH IS A PRETTY RURAL AREA- HAS ITS OWN POLICE DEPARTMENT VERY SMALL- LESS THAN THIRTY OFFICERS AND THERE'D FOR DOING THEIR DARNDEST. TO TRY TO MAKE A DENT IN THIS VERY LISTED SPACE I GUESS WHAT THEY FOUND IN THEIR COMMUNITY THE CHINESE CARTEL. AND IT'S A MULTI MILLION DOLLAR OPERATION GOING ON. THIS IS A BAD FOLKS WE HAVE A REAL IT'S ALARMING HOW BAD IT IS. YET THE ENERGY TO GO AFTER ENFORCEMENT I HOPE THAT THE GOVERNOR AND THIS LEGISLATURE WILL UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE. AND THE CRISIS IT'S A CRISIS ALREADY IT'S NOT COMING IT'S HERE. AND I DON'T KNOW HOW TO MAKE INDISCRIMINATE LOUDER OTHERS. SAY THAT WE'VE GOT TO WORK ON THIS I MEAN. WE MADE A PROPOSAL YEAR FOR THE TEN MILLION DOLLARS. TOWARDS ENFORCEMENT AND WHERE TO GO TOWARDS. THE EQUITY. AND I'M NOT AYING THAT IS NOT A VALUABLE BUT INVESTMENT. BUT NOT AT THE EXPENSE OF ENFORCEMENT. AND I JUST NEEDED TO VENTILATE SO I DON'T HAVE A QUESTION TO ANY OF YOU I DON'T HAVE A CRITICISM TO ANY OF YOU. IT'S JUST DRIVE HIM CRAZY. BECAUSE I'M A MORMON REPUBLICAN AND FIGHTING FOR CANNABIS. I MEAN THIS IS NOT A COMFORTABLE SPACE FOR ME THEN REPUBLICAN OKAY SOLVE STRIKE THREE. I'M JUST TELLING YOU MY HEART COULDN'T BE MORE INTO THIS BECAUSE IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO AND THIS EVEN IF IT'S ON COMFORTABLE I'M NOT GOING AWAY. AND IM HOPING THAT WE CAN PENETRATE THE YEARS OF POWER. BECAUSE I HAVE A WHISPER AND I'M GONNA SCREAM AND MY WHISPERS MUCH AS I CAN. UNTIL WE ACTUALLY TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY BECAUSE GOOD PEOPLE. ARE GETTING THEIR **** WHACKED. AND THEY'RE DOING THEIR BEST AND IT'S NOT RIGHT THAT THIS. IS THE TUITION THAT THE TRUST IS BETRAYING THEM. BECAUSE WE ARE. THIS IS A MILLION ECHOING. MR LACKEYS. EFFORTS WITH RESPECT TO- OF TO ENFORCEMENT AND LEGAL OPERATORS AND SPECIFIC YOU LAURIE ON THE- WITH THE BUREAU OF CANNABIS CONTROL I UNDERSTAND THAT- FOR EXAMPLE IT TECHNOLOGY COMPANY WE MET HAVE REMOVED THEIR LIGHT UNLICENSED LISTINGS BUT I JUST KEEP CAME UPON AS AN ADVERTISEMENT ON YELP THAT IS SELLING THE- GIFT CERTIFICATES ON THE WEBSITE OF FOR ILLEGAL CANNABIS SHOPS- IT HOW DO WE TACKLE THIS IN IS THERE ANY ENGAGEMENT IN EFFORTS- FROM YOUR VANTAGE POINT ON HOW I UNDERSTAND THAT WE'VE HAD THIS CONVERSATION BEFORE WITH RESPECT TO WHACK A MOLE BUT- WE- TO. ADDRESS THESE ISSUES THAT WE CAN HELP GOOD ACTORS AS WELL. YEAH WE GET A LOT OF COMPLAINTS ON ADVERTISEMENTS AND SO WE ARE OBVIOUSLY RESPONDED THOSE BUT WE ALSO PROACTIVELY ARE GOING INTO THE DIFFERENT- ILLEGAL ON THE INTERNET I'M SORRY INTERNET PLATFORMS TO CHECK TO SEE OF THEIR COMPLIANCE IF. OF PEOPLE ARE DISPLAYING THEIR LICENSE NUMBER THEN WE'RE CHECKING IT WITH OUR LICENSE SEARCH TO MAKE SURE IT MATCHES UP IN SOME CASES IT FOR SEEN THINGS. THAT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT'S A LEGAL BUSINESS WE WILL REPORT THAT TO THE INTERNET PLATFORM AND WE DO EXPECT THEM TO- TO TAKE THAT DOWN OR PROVIDE US MORE INFORMATION OF WHY THEY THINK IT'S LEGAL. AND WORST THIS A LITTLE BIT MORE SUCCESS BY ENGAGING THE INTERNET PLATFORM WE'RE ALSO IN THE PROCESS OF SETTING UP ADDITIONAL TOOLS FOR THESE INTERNET PLATFORMS TO AUTOMATICALLY CONNECT TO OUR LICENSE SEARCH THROUGH AN API- SO WE CAN PROVIDE THEM. IT'S A LITTLE BIT EASIER IF THEY CAN AUTOMATICALLY CONNECT INSTEAD OF GOING LINE BY LINE- LOOKING AT OUR LICENSE SEARCH TRYING TO FIGURE THAT OUT SO I THINK- WE'RE STARTING THAT PROCESS NOW AND IF WE CAN'T GET COMPLIANCE THEN. I THINK WE'RE LOOKING AT OTHER TOOLS TO RAMP UP THE ENFORCEMENT AND- PERHAPS LOOK AT SOME FINES OR PENALTIES. IT IN THE KNEE JERKS WORKING THAT PLAN YELP A THEY BEEN. TO THE ISSUES THAT WHEN YOU I'VE BROUGHT ITTO THEIR ATTENTION. I BECAUSE MOST OF THESE ARE PENDING INVESTIGATIONS I CAN'T TALK ABOUT. SPECIFIC INTERNET PLATFORMS. BUT WE ARE ENGAGING WITH THE INTERNET PLATFORMS SURE AND PERHAPS MAYBE A DIFFERENT QUESTION- ARE THERE ANY OPPORTUNITIES OR MECHANISMS THAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO ASSIST YOU WITH A TO ENCOURAGE AND GET A GREATER SENSE OF URGENCY WITH RESPECT INTERNET PLATFORMS. I THINK- I THINK WE'RE ALREADY FINDING OUT JUST WORKING WITH THEM ON FIDING OUT THERE CERTAIN INFORMATION IN OUR LICENSE SEARCH THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO HIM FOR EXAMPLE WE DON'T REQUIRE THAT PEOPLE PUT ON THEIR LICENSE APPLICATION A DBA AND MOST PEOPLE WHEN THEY'RE ADVERTISING THEY'RE NOT USING THEIR LEGAL BUSINESS NAME THEY'RE USING A DBA. SO WE'RE MAKING CHANGES TO MAKE THAT A REQUIREMENT SO THAT CAN HELP THEM SO I THINK WE'RE TRYING TO WORK THROUGH THAT PROCESS BUT I THINK ONCE THEY HAVE THE TOOLS AND- I THINK THERE MAY BE THINGS THAT WE- WOULD BE IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO US DOWN THE ROAD I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING SPECIFIC. RIGHT NOW BUT- I WOULD CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BRING SOMETHING FORWARD WHEN WE COME ACROSS IT. AND I JUST WANT TO SAY WE ALSO DO A LOT OF EVERY WE DO THE SAME THING WITH THE BILLBOARD COMPANIES AS WELL WE GET A LOT OF COMPLAINTS ON BILLBOARDS THAT ARE OUT OF COMPLIANCE. SO NOT ONLY DO WE WORK WITH THE LICENSEE WERE ALSO WORKING WITH THE BILL FOR COMPANIES THAT IS PUTTING UP THOSE BILLBOARDS TO GET THEM TO REMOVE IT SO IT'S ON THE SAME FRONT LIKE THE INTERNET PLATFORMS AS WELL. GREAT THANK YOU SO AND YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN VERY ACCESSIBLE- ONE OF BEEF BROUGHT THIS TO YOUR ATTENTION SO I KNOW THAT YOU'LL BE FROM YOUR COMMITMENT TO ENSURING THAT WE HAVE THE REGULATED. A MARKET THAT'S RIFE WITH RESPECT TO THESE PLATFORMS SPECIFICALLY AND THEN FINALLY- WITH RESPECT TO THE CONSOLIDATION THEM WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IF YOU MIGHT. THE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE CURRENTLY ON THIS PANEL- HERE TODAY. HOW DO YOU FOR C. THAN CONSOLIDATION WITH RESPECT TO THE PROGRAM WHAT. WHAT WHAT IS THE PROGRAM'S THEN GO. WELL I MEAN I A I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION I MEAN I THINK I GAVE SORT OF THE OVER ARCHING GOALS OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE HERE SORT OF A- SIMPLER MORE EFFECTIVE SYSTEM AND- AT ONE PLACE WHICH I THINK IS SOMETHING WE'VE HEARD. FROM INDUSTRY THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS- YOU KNOW EVEN THE LEGISLATURE I THINK IN SOME WAY THOUGHT ONE PLACE WOULD MAKE SENSE- THESE WORKING GROUPS ARE WORKING DILIGENTLY TO FIGURE OUT. YOU KNOW WHAT MAKES SENSE- AND HOW TO IMPLEMENT THIS ANY SORT OF REORGANIZATION OR CONSOLIDATION IS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF EFFORT. JUST IF WE WERE GONNA TAKE IT IS AND TRY TO PUT IT INTO A DIFFERENT DEPARTMENT SO- YOU KNOW I THINK THOSE THOSE DETAILS WERE REALLY STILL WORKING OUT AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO SHARING THOSE WITH YOU IN THE SPRING. BUT THE IDEA HERE IS TO BUILD ON THE WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE BY THESE PROGRAMS BECAUSE I THINK AS YOU ALL KNOW THAT THEIR WORK SHOULD BE APPLAUDED THEY PUT A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF EFFORT IN THE LAST FEW YEARS STANDING UP- OF. THIS MY FROM THANK AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IN THE CONSOLE SO NOTE NO SPECIFICS BUT MORE TO COME I'M WE RELEASE OUR BUDGET AND TRAILER BILL PROPOSALS. OKAY SO NO NO CLEAR ON WHERE THE PROGRAMS OF THE FOUR WOULD GO UNDER CONSOLIDATION. WHERE THE WIFE WHERE WHERE WHERE THE CONSOLIDATION AGO WHERE WHERE THE FOR YOU WOULD BE AND HOW WE WOULD BE PLACED IN THE THEY SHOULD KNOW DIFFERENT COLOR. THIRTY SO RIGHT WHERE WHERE DO YOU ALL GO I WAS GONNA YEAH HOGAN'S BUT WE'VE USED FOR THEIR JOB WHERE DO YOU INDIVIDUALLY GO YEAH I KNOW I MEAN I THINK THAT'S A I THINK THOSE DETAILS ARE STILL BEING TO TALK A SAID THERE'S NO ANSWER. YES RIGHT OKAY SO THERE IS NO ANSWER BUT YOU'VE HAD ESTABLISHED WORKING GROUPS RIGHT RIGHT AND WHO WILL CONSIST OF THESE WORKING GROUPS- THE PEOPLE AT THIS TABLE IN ADDITION TO THE MANY OTHERS WITHIN EACH OF THESE PROGRAMS THAT HAVE YOU KNOW. INTIMATE KNOWLEDGE OF THE ACTIVITIES THAT THEY'RE DOING TODAY OKAY SO I THINK PART OF THE CHALLENGE THAT EXISTS IS SUCH THAT- THERE IS CONSOLIDATION PROPOSED. WITH RESPECT TO WHICH YOU WANT TO DO ON ON THE FOR WITH THAT THE FOUR OF YOU. AND YET YOU REQUIRE LEGISLATIVE APPROVAL. AND YET WE ARE NOT ENGAGED IN THESE CONVERSATIONS WITH RESPECT TO. OUR ANNOUNCED STANDING ALL OF THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED ABOUT HOW TO HELP YOU BE SET COME SUCCESSFUL HOW TO OPEN POWER YOU WITH THE TOOLS NECESSARY TO BECOME. SUCCESSFUL AND THEREIN LIES I THINK PART OF THE CHALLENGE THAT I HOPE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION ALSO HERE. WHICH IS THAT WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT RESERVATIONS. ON WHAT IS ACTUALLY OCCURRING. AND IF YOU WORK JUST SIMPLY A SOLUTION WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION TALKING AMONGST OURSELVES WITHIN THE WITH THESE WORKING GROUPS. AND NOT ALLOWING BROAD STAKEHOLDER INPUT TO WE'VE TRADITIONALLY HAD ON THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS WITH A WIDE VARIETY OF OTHER ENTITIES. THAT WOULD NATURALLY WHEN THE SUN SETS COME UP FOR PUBLIC DISCUSSION. THERE MIGHT OF THE CHALLENGE AND DID THE FRICTION THAT WILL CONTINUE TO OCCUR. SO AGAIN PART OF THE QUESTION THEN IS HOW DO YOU FORESEE. BROUGHT STAKEHOLDER INPUT. TO BE INCORPORATED WITHIN THESE WORKING GROUPS IF YOU'RE JUST TALKING AMONGST YOURSELVES WITH BY THE WAY I'LL STILL NEEDS LEGISLATIVE. APPROVAL I THINK THERE'S BEEN A OT OF OUR REACH THAT PLACE OVER THE FALL WITH YOU. GOING OUT TO MEET WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS- IN INDUSTRY FOLKS TO GET THEIR INPUT- WHAT I. I KNOW WE'VE HAD A FEW MEETINGS WE ACTUALLY HAD A FAIRLY LARGE MEETING IN NOVEMBER WITH LEGISLATIVE STAFF TO TRY TO GET- TAKEN AND PUT- TO MAKE SURE THAT WE UNDERSTAND. SORT OF YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT YOU ALL WOULD LIKE TO SEE AND I HOPE AND I HOPE TODAY WILL BE ABLE TO HEAR SOME THOSE MORE SPECIFIC THINGS YOU'D LIKE TO SEE FROM THE CONSOLIDATION. BECAUSE THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO GO INTO IS WELL I DON'T THINK WE'RE TRYING TO DO IT IN ISOLATION- AND I THINK IN A CONVERSATION. AT THE STAFF LEVEL OF CERTAINLY BEEN OPEN TO LET. IS HELP US UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW. THAT MA'AM WOULD LIKE SEE SO WE CAN. DO OUR BEST TO INCORPORATE THOSE THINGS OR AT LEAST TO BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN TO YOU WHY WE COULDN'T DO THOSE THINGS NOW- IN SO I KIND OF DO I DO FEEL LIKE WE'RE TRYING TO. YOU KNOW BE OPEN AND OUT THERE AND- IS FAR AS THE DEVELOPMENTS GOES I MEAN IT'S VERY SIMILAR TO ALMOST ANYTHING THAT'S WHERE DEVELOPED IS THERE'S A DELIBERATIVE PROCESS AND- THAT HAS TO TAKE PLACE AND THEN WE- PLAN TO ENGAGE YOU ALL AS WE- TYPICALLY. DO THROW. BUDGET PROCESS WE HAVE HAD AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO THOSE DISCUSSIONS SO- I THINK YOU KNOW WHAT UNFORTUNATELY I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF DETAILS TO SHARE TODAY BUT WE HAVE BEEN TAKING AN EMPLOYEE HAVE BEEN HEARING FROM FOLKS IF THERE ARE SPECIFIC PROPOSALS OR IDEAS YOU ALL HAVE THAT YOU'D LIKE TO SEE INCORPORATED I'VE HEARD ENFORCEMENTINCIDENT IN A PRIORITY TODAY- THAT YOU KNOW DOES THE TYPE THINGS THAT ARE HELPFUL TO US AS WE GO INTO THE DEVELOPMENT THIS EXTENT POSSIBLE LIKE TO BE ABLE TO INCORPORATE. SURE AND THEN JUST PUT YOU PRIOR TO. THE PROPOSAL WHICH IS. APPROXIMATELY MAY IS THAT CORRECT WITH WHICH YOU. LOOK LOOK LIKE THE TIME THAT. AND CLEAR AT THIS OKAY SO TIME IS UNCLEAR- BUT IT THE HERMES AND CLEAR BUT THERE IS NO MECHANISM AND NO SCHEDULE DATE TO WHICH WE CAN HAVE AN ADDITION. ADDITIONAL DIALOGUE AMONGST THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH. AND OF THE MINISTRATIONS. NOT AT THIS TIME OKAY SO A PART OF THAT IT WOULD BEGIN AGAIN TO HIGHLIGHT. THIS THIS CHALLENGE. WE WANT TO BEST UTILIZE THE OPPORTUNITY THAT WE HAVE WHICH IS THAT OF THIS INFORMATION HERE BUT ABSENT THAT WE HAVE NO MECHANISM TO BE ABLE TO ENGAGE WITH YOU. TO HELP HAVE THIS COLLABORATIVE DIALOGUE TO WHICH THEN YOU HAVE A PROPOSAL IN ISOLATION OUTSIDE OF THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH AND YET YOU'LL STILL COME TO US TO ASK FOR APPROVAL. SO I'LL JUST SAY IS THAT IS ONE GAUGE AND A STOP TYLER. THE BILL SO WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE BECAUSE IT DOESN'T GOOD TO. LOOK IT GOTCHA MOMENTS WE WANT SET YOU UP FOR SUCCESS. AND SIMILARLY WILL BE ABLE TO BE RESPONSIVE TO THE CONCERT SEE THAT WE ALSO EQUALLY RIGHT. AS WELL. TOTAL AGREED AND WE WANT. TO HEAR PROPOSED HAVE THROUGH DISCUSS ON THIS. GREAT THANK YOU BUT GETTING HERE A IN THE MAY REVISED HELP LEGISLATORS. INVITED OVER TO MEET WITH YOU GUYS AT IT. SO YOU GUYS ALL FOR THEM AS- BUT LUCIUS LAUGHED IS A CRITICAL PART OF IT. THE INVOLVED THE GHOST. YOU PLAY HAD MORE DISCUSSIONS WITH FOLKS OUTSIDE. THIS BUILDING IN THE GOVERNMENT. LOCAL GOVERNMENT HOWEVER THEN INSTEAD OF SO. WE'RE MARCHES HERE ALREADY. IF YOU GUYS HAD NO I WHEN YOU'RE COMING FORWARD TO WORK WITH STAFF IT'S ALSO AND WE'RE AT THE MAY REVISE IT COMES OUT THAT'S NONE OF TIME. WE SHOULD AMPLE TIME THIS IS NOT A PROBLEM HAS BEEN GOING ON. YEAH WE ALL THE BILL HERE BEALL SPOKE ABOUT AD NAUSEAM. IT IS SOME POINT WE'VE GOT A REALLY PARTS PLEASE BUT- FAST WORK WITH IT. NOT JUST ONE TIME LAST NOVEMBER. SO WHAT THE PLANS GOING FORWARD. TO GET IT TO US ONTIME AND NOT AT A LATER DATE AND HOW DO YOU PLAN ON WORKING WITH STAFF FROM THE LEGISLATURE'S MITCHELL SAID. WE'RE PART A TRY AT. BUT LIKE I SAID I THINK WE'RE WORKING DILIGENTLY MOST OF US ARE IN MEETINGS MULTIPLE TIMES A WEEK- BUT BUT NOT NOT NOT WITH LEGISLATIVE STAFF THE LESS THE DEAL. THAT ARE CERTAINLY NOT NIGHT WE DON'T BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE YOU KNOW. COHERENT DETAILS CARE AT THIS POINT BUT I AM OPEN AYE IT'S AN OPEN INVITATION. WITH STAFF AT ANY POINT IF THEY HAVE IDEAS ARE CONSIDERATIONS TO REACH OUT- CHASSIS AND LET LET US KNOW ABOUT THOSE AND WE WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THOSE DISCUSSIONS I THINK TO BE HELPFUL ON THE WAY FOR STEP TO BEING GAUGE EVEN JUST. MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WAY IT'S NOT ALL PILED OUT OF THE IT. THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT. I UNDERSTAND ON A MORE QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. OKAY GO HEAD TO CARTER THIRD PANEL. WHICH IS LOVE PERSPECTIVE. GOOD FOR YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN WAS THE COMMITTEE- MY NAME IS CARE MARTINS AND I AM A SENIOR LEGISLATIVE REPRESENTATIVE WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES I ALSO SERVE AS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF A NEWLY CREATED ORGANIZATION THAT COUNTIES CREATED CALLED THE CALIFORNIA- CANNABIS AUTHORITY IT'S A JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY MADE UP OF COUNTY GOVERNMENTS THAT HAVE COME TOGETHER TO PROVIDE IT TIONAL TOOL FR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THAT ARE RIGHT IN CANNABIS. FIRST I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR HAVING THIS YEAR- I DO THINK AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WE SHARE A LOT OF THE FRUSTRATIONS THAT I HEAR- COMING FROM YOU AND WE ARE REALLY CRYING OUT SCREAMING AT SOMETIME OR PARTNERSHIP WITH STATE A LOT OF AREAS AND OF THE- CALL HAVE AN ANSWER. WHICH I'LL GET IN JUST A WITH SUCH A PROP SIX FOUR AS YOU KNOW WE ESSENTIALLY CREATED A DUAL LICENSING SYSTEM AND WE BY AND IT'S NOT PERFECT ALL SAY BUT YOU IN ORDER TO BE FULLY OPERATIONAL IN FORMULA IN ADDITION TO A STATE LICENSE YOU NEED A PERMIT WHAT. OTHER AND WE FEEL THAT THE ALL THIS ANTENNA LOCAL CONTROL- VERY STRONG HE BECAUSE WELL THE MAJORITY OF HEALTH ARE SO POOR- I DON'T USE FOR A KING BED. THIS IS ARE LOCATED HOW MANY OF OUR OUR COMMUNITIES. AND REALLY WHAT THE SIZE AND OF THE- ARE IS REALLY A LOCAL AND IN SOME CASES A SENSITIVE ISSUE WITH OF DIVERSITY OF APPROACHES. AND THOSE PROGRAMS AND APPROACHES CONTINUE TO OF ALL THAT THE CITY AND COUNTY LEVEL- AS VOTE MORE MORE FOLKS COME ONLINE TO REGULATE. AND JUST TO GIVE YOU A QUICK SNAPSHOT OF THE LANDSCAPING CALIFORNIA THERE ABOUT A HUNDRED CITIES AND TWENTY EIGHT COUNTIES REGULATING THUS FAR SO THAT'S ABOUT 20% OF CITIES AND NEARLY NUMBER MIGHT- SEEM LOW IN REALITY IT REPRESENTS ABOUT IN A CITY OR COUNTY JURISDICTION THAT REGULATES CANNABIS SO WE'RE WORKING TO GET. THAT NUMBER UP FOR THOSE JURISDICTIONS THAT ARE INTERESTED IN REGULATING BUT WE NEED SOME ADDITIONAL TOOLS TO DO THAT. REALLY THE IMPEDIMENT TO REGULATION IS NOT SIMPLY AN OBJECTION TO CANNABIS LIKE YOU FROM THE STATE IT'S A LONG TIME. IN A TO ITS PROBE. ZERO ENVIRONMENT COMPLETE IMPACTS ON OUR YOUTH IN OUR COMMUNITY IS PUBLIC EDUCATION AND REALLY OUR ULTIMATE GOAL WHICH WE SHARE WITH THE STATE IS BRINGING PEOPLE INTO THE RGULATED SPACE. AND COME BACK ILLICIT MARKET AND ENSURING THAT THE LEGAL MARKET FLOURISHES- AND BUSINESS IS THRIVING CALIFORNIA THAT IS WHY PARTNERSHIP WITH THE STATE SO CRITICAL ALL- SO. CAN BE SUBSTANCE OF THESE COSTS BY ON DEVELOPING THEIR OWN RESOURCES THROUGH TAX MEASURES ON A AND SHE REVENUE AT THE LOCAL LATE LEVEL BUT AS WE'VE SEEN. HIGHER RATES OF TAXATION COMPLEX SYSTEMS OF REGULATION ARE REALLY ARE AN IMPEDIMENT FOR OPERATORS I NEED TO THE REGULATED MARKET- LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND RESPONDED IN A NUMBER OF CASES FROM THE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE BY REDUCE. THAT ACTS BURDEN IN CASE THE IN LIKE COME COUNTY SO. OUR TAX FOR AIR TO. MORE BROAD. TO BOTH SPACE. A WAY THAT'S LEESBURG OPERATORS WHILE GIVING- REALLY EVERYTHING WE NEED TO COMBAT THE LIST OF MARKET IS NOT AN EASY FEAT AS WE'VE WE'VE ALL EXPERIENCE BUT- ONE THING THAT WE'VE LEARNED OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS IN OUR WORK- WITH- COUNTIES IS THAT DATA IS REALLY AT THE HEART OF THIS SYSTEM AND IT'S VERY SPECIAL AND IMPORTANT TO EFFECTIVE REGULATION AND ENFORCEMENT. SO OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS COUNTIES HAVE COME TOGETHER TO BE PROACTIVE IN WORK WITH ONE ANOTHER AND A AND DEVELOP OUR JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY- REALLY WITH THE PURPOSE OF DEVELOPING AND MANAGING A STATEWIDE DATA PLATFORM NOW THIS IS BY NO MEANS MEANT TO DUPLICATE THE STATE'S TRACK AND TRACE SYSTEM OTHER IT'S MEANT TO AGGREGATE INFORMATION OUT THERE ANALYZE AND PROVIDE- REAL TIME DATA TO LOCAL JURISDICTIONS- THAT ARE REGULATING USING MACHINE LEARNING THAT HAS BUILT IN ANALYTICS AND ALERTS CAN REALLY HELP FOR GREATER TAX COMPLIANCE AND REGULATION- AND WE CREATED THIS ORGANIZATION FOR SEVERAL REASONS AS I MENTIONED- LOCALS HAVE. LIMITED RESOURCES IT'S A FACT WE'RE DEALING WITH HOMELESSNESS WE'RE DEALING WITH AFFORDABLE HOUSING PRICES WERE DEALING WITH A LOT ISSUE BUT THE COMMUNITY IN A MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIA HAS SPOKEN AND THEY WANT LEGAL CAMPUS WE TRYING TO. WRITER TAX COMPLIANCE FROM BUSINESSES AND GETTING FOLKS INTO THE REGULATED SPACE WE ALSO NEED TO BUILD TRUST WITH THE INDUSTRY- WHICH MEANS WE HAVE TO EDUCATE YOUR ARE ON LOCAL FOLKS ABOUT WHAT THE INDUSTRY IS AND WHAT THEY'RE DOING- AND THEN FOCUS OUR COMPLIANCE EFFORTS NFORCEMENT ON THOSE FOLKS THAT ARE REALLY OUTSIDE OF THE BOUNDS OF REGULATION IN IN THE ILLICIT MARKET PLACE AND REALLY TO DO THAT THE ONLY WAY TO DO THAT IS. GOOD AND TEN IS CLOSED JONES ON. A WE WANT TO HELP THEM THAT FOR. AND CAL TO ACCESS FOR SIR. WE HAVE A CONFLICT BETWEEN STE AND LAW BUT THERE ARE OVER FIVE HUNDRED BANKS CREDIT UNIONS IN THE COUNTRY THAT ARE WORKING WITH INDUSTRY BUT WHAT THEY NEED. IS DATA DATA TO ENSURE THAT EVERY DEPOSIT INTO THEIR FINANCIAL INSTITUTION IS FROM A LEGAL TRANSACTION AND THEY NEED THAT FROM REGULATORS. AND WE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WITH OUR PLAN WITH OUR PLATFORM AND IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE STATE HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO DO THAT AND TO MOVE THE DIAL THERE SO THAT'S REALLY ALL TO MY GOAL. OF THE ORGANIZATION BUT UNFORTUNATELY- WE HAVE NOT HAD THE PARTNERSHIP THAT WE'D LIKE TO SEE YOU WITH OUR STATE REGULATORY PARTNERS IN A NUMBER OF AREAS YES BUT IN THIS SPECIFIC AREA OF SHARING DATA. NO AFTER REPEATED REQUESTS. FOR INFORMATION OUR CALL SO GOING ON ANSWERED THERE IS A PILOT PROGRAM THAT'S PENDING BUT FROM OUR- MEMBERS PERSPECTIVE IT'S INADEQUATE IT'S STATIC REPORTS THAT DON'T PROVIDE THE REAL TIME INFORMATION THAT WE NEED. WITH OUR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT PARTNERS PARTNERING WITH THE STATE TO GO AFTER THE FOLKS THAT WE REALLY NEED TO FOCUS OUR ATTENTION ON. HEARD FROM A NUMBER OF FOLKS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND THEIR OPERATORS THAT THERE'S A LOT OF FRUSTRATION BECAUSE OUR COMPLIANCE EFFORTS ARE FOCUSED ON THOSE THAT MIGHT NOT HAVE ONE BUILDING PERMIT. BUT THE LICENSE FULLY LICENSED ROUTE SORT OF THE ALL THE OTHER ENTITIES IN APARTMENTS. WHILE THEIR NEIGHBOR GOES FORTH AND- ONE FOOT OUT THE DOOR AND IS REALLY EITHER. PRODUCT OR NOT WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF REGULATION AT ALL AND THE ONLY WAY WE CAN REALLY PRIORITIZE EFFORT IS HAVING. TOUR DATA. OUR AND FOR ACCESS ISSUE SAY. THE TRACK AND TRACE. THE STATE A MESS OR TO AMOUNT OF RE IN THIS PRO. AND IN ORDER FOR TO BE YOU AND IF IT NAY TO BE SHE AMONG SMALL TO. LEVELS OF KERR WITH THE- GOVERNOR PER. PROPOSAL FOR CONSOLIDATION WE DO THINK THAT THERE IS AN ABILITY NOT ONLY TO. LOOK AT HOW ARE REGULATORY PROGRAM AT BOTH THE STATE AND THE LEVEL IS STRUCTURED BUT TO IMPROVE THAT PARTNERSHIP AND CREATE EFFICIENCIES AND GET MORE FOLKS. ARE INTO THE REGULATED SPACE AND WE MUST DO THIS BY EMBRACING TECHNOLOGY CONNECTING BOTH LOCAL AND STATE SETS OF DATA- AND ALSO WILL BE AN INNOVATIVE- CREATING WEBINARS AND FACT SHEETS AND HOT LINE NUMBERS IS IMPORTANT BUT THAT'S NOT THE WAY WE'RE GOING TO TACKLE THE ILLICIT MARKET PLACE THE ONLY WAY WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT. IS BY A TRUE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE- AND- HELLO WELL AN ACCESS TO INFORMATION THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS- A LEGAL. RIGHT SEE. WE DO BELIEVE SHIP IN. EIGHT BEAR AND WE ARE MORE THAN WILLING TO STEP UP AND WORK OUR STATE RAY. AGENCIES AND ALSO BE PART OF THESE CON. THAT WE'RE NOT BEEN CALLED TO ANY OF THE TO TALK ABOUT CAN. AND LOW GOVERNMENT ARE REALLY A CRITICAL COMPONENT TO THIS ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE VARIATION OF PROGRAMS WE HAVE ACROSS THE STATE ONE OF THE OTHER COOL. OF ON THE CALIFORNIA AT THE WILL BE WAS GET FOLKS TOGETHER AT THE LOCAL LEVEL TO TALK ABOUT. BEST PRACTICES AND WE HELP TO SYNTHESIZE THOSE. THOSE PROGRAM EXCUSE MAKING IT EASY FOR A- TO ENTER INTO THE REGULATOR SPACE BUT ALSO PRESERVING SO THAT WILL VERY. AND A LOCAL ROLE AND OF SORT OF THE BOUNDS OF WHAT REGULATE. I'M JUST THANK YOU FOR THE ARE. TO MY COM A I DO SEE THAT THERE. ARE SINCE. TO HAVE THIS. IS TO GET IT OUT IN THE- WE ALL CAN DO BETTER WE ALL HAVE TO DO BETTER. AND WE'RE MORE THAN INTO UP AND IT AND DO THE WORK. YOU. AFTER. IN THIS OF THE ILLICIT MARKET MY NAME IS CHARLES HARBIN LEGISLATIVE REPRESENTATIVE WITH LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES- IT'S BEEN STATED BEFORE BUT I JUST WANT TO REITERATE AT THE OUTSET THAT- THE LEAGUE IS NEITHER PRO NOR ANTI CANNABIS- AND OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS OF COURSE CITIES HAVE MADE CLEAR THE IMPORTANCE OF SAFEGUARDING THEIR LOOK TORY AUTHORITY HOW TO DECIDE WHETHER AND TYPE OF COMMERCIAL AND THIS IS APPROPRIATE FOR COMMUNITIES AT THE END OF THE DAY CITIES WHAT- SIMILAR TO WHAT. THE SMARTS AND TALK TO WE WANT TO BE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE STATE- AND HELPING TO SHAPE LOCALIZED MARKETPLACE COORDINATE ON STRATEGIES THAT PROACTIVELY WORK TOWARD READING THE ILLICIT MARKET AND OF COURSE MAINTAIN THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THOSE CITIES WHO CHOOSE TO AUTHORIZE COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY TO IMPLEMENT SCHEMES THAT NOT ONLY GENERATE REVENUE AND I WAS WITHIN THE COMMUNITY I'M SURE SAFETY LEGIT HE- REGULAR. THOUGHT TO THIS I WAS A POOR FOR THE CAN. ALL COLLABORATION ON MORE DIFFICULT I WILL WHEN IT COMES TO THE FORMATION OF A NEW DEPARTMENT- INSTEAD OF A BUREAU WELL WE OBVIOUSLY HAVE YET TO SEE ANY DETAILS AS TO WHAT IS ENVISIONED WE ARE UP TO THINK ABOUT THE OVERALL CONCEPT OF ESTABLISHING WHAT WE CONSIDER TO BE A ONE STOP SHOP WE HOPE TO BE A ONE STOP SHOP FOR ALL OF CALIFORNIAS MARSHALL CANNABIS RELATED MATTER. RISING THE END NO NOT TO BEAT A DEAD HORSE BUT THE OVER ARCHING THEME OF MY PRELIMINARY CONVERSATIONS WITH- SOME OF OUR LOCAL OFFICIALS ON WHAT WOULD BE MOST HELPFUL TO CITIES IS COURSE INCREASED EMPHASIS ON AND MEN TAKE EARLY AS PERTAINS TO THE ILLICIT MARKET PLACE. SO TAKE IN THE SIZE YOU WITH I SINCE OPERATORS OF FOR INSTANCE TO ENGAGE IN MULTIPLE TYPES OF COMMERCE CITY MANUFACTURING. A CALL. AND INCREDIBLY DE. WHEN YOU HAVE DEAL WITH THREE DISTINCT AND SEPARATE LICENSING AUTHORITIES TO ADDRESS THE ACTIVITY OF A SINGLE OPERATOR. WERE CALLED IN EFFORTS TO COORDINATE- LIKE IT'S THAT ARE MADE VERY DIFFICULT. ENSURING THAT COMMUNICATION STRUCTURES IN PLACE TO SWIFTLY ADDRESSED THE QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS OF CITIES WHO ARE EARNESTLY TRYING TO GO THROUGH THE PROPER CHANNELS. TO RID OF PERSISTENT LEGAL ACTIVITY IS PARAMOUNT IN THE FOURTH COME SOLID ATION. RELATEDLY GIVEN THE REALITY AT LEGALWAS PRODUCTS INTENDED FOR ADULTS INEVITABLY FIND THEIR WAY INTO THE HANDS OF ADOLESCENCE. THERE IS GROWING CONCERN OVER THE PROLIFERATION OF ACCESS TO AN INCREASED USE. CANNABIS UNDER AGE PER. S. CITIES LIKE TO SEE SOME SORT OF LOCAL ENFORCEMENT DIVISION- THAT WOULD NOT ONLY HELP TARGET UNLICENSED ACTIVITY BUT WOULD ALSO PRO ACTIVELY WORKED TO HELP PREVENT AND TO TURN THESE LEGALIZED ADULT. PRODUCTS FROM BEING ACCESSED BY MINORS. CITY OFFICIALS THERE BY NOTE THAT THERE REMAINS A WIDESPREAD NEED FOR ROBUST EDUCATION EFFORTS THAT FOCUS ON K. THROUGH TWELVE SCHOOLS. AND OF COURSE THE PARENTS OF STUDENTS ON THE POTENTIALLY HARMFUL PHYSICAL. AND PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS THAT CANNABIS CAN PRODUCE ON YOUTH. A CITIES WOULD ENCOURAGE THE NEWLY CONSOLIDATED THE ENOUGH CAN CONTROL. YOUR TAKE JACK'S REGARDLESS OF EDUCATIONAL EFFORTS THAT ARE ALREADY BEING MADE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. LIKE WISE- CITIES AGAIN NEED MORE TOOLS AND RESOURCES TO PROPERLY ENFORCE AGAINST ILLICIT ACTIVITY THEMSELVES. WHILE IT MIGHT NOT DIRECTLY RELATE TO THE PROPOSED CONSOLIDATION HELPFUL MECHANISMS FOR LOCALS- COULD INCLUDE OF COURSE EXPRESS AUTHORIZATION FOR CITY ATTORNEYS TO BRING UNFAIR COMPETITION LAWSUITS AGAINST UNLICENSED OPERATORS. THIS OF COURSE COULD LEAD TO DISGORGEMENT OF PROFITS AND OR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF CEASE OPERATIONS ALSO THE ABILITY FOR CITIES TO SEIZE PRODUCT FROM UNLICENSED OPERATORS MIGHT ALSO. WITH THE STORE PASS. IT TAKES ACTION AT PRESENT CITIES CAN ONLY PLACE A DEAD BOLT ON THE DOOR OF ILLEGAL BUSINESS FOR INSTANCE- BUT OPERATORS ARE OFTEN ABLE TO PROMPTLY REMOVED- THIS ITEM AND RELOCATE THEIR PRODUCT TO A DIFFERENT ILLICIT MARKET OUT. THE BOTTOM LINE UNLESS AND UNTIL CITIES GET THE PROPER RESOURCES AND TOOLS TO CONDUCT MEANINGFUL ENFORCEMENT AGAINST ILLEGAL OPERATORS. IT REMAINS INCUMBENT UPON THE STATE TO BEEF UP IF IT'S ENFORCEMENT CAPACITY IDEALLY WITHIN THE NEWLY ESTABLISHED DEPARTMENT CANNABIS CONTROL. SECOND WITHIN THIS NEW DEPARTMENT CITIES COULD BENEFIT FROM SORT OF A LOCAL DIVISION A LOCAL JURISDICTION DIVISION OF SORTS WHICH WOULD IDEALLY COMPRISE. PERSONNEL DEDICATED TO ASSIST WITH A VARIETY OF REQUEST ENFORCEMENT OR OTHERWISE THAT ARE SPECIFIC TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. I FOR INSTANCE- THE CITY AREA- WANTS TO ENSURE THAT LOCAL OPERATORS THEY ARE COMPLYING WITH MINIMUM REQUIRED BUFFER ZONE. BETWEEN THEIR CANNABIS BUSINESSES AND NEIGHBORHOOD SCHOOLS AND OUR FAMILY HOME DAY CARE CENTERS IN THIS CASE THERE WOULD BE DEDICATED STAFF WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF CAMPS CONTROLLED. SERVE AS A LIAISON FOR THE OFF PRESENT CITY AND BE ABLE TO COORDINATE WITH OTHER DEPARTMENTS. PRESS IS CHILD CARE LICENSING DIVISION TO ASSIST WITH SUCH A REQUEST. A CITIES OF NOTED INSTANCES WHERE THEY HAVE MULTIPLE PHONE CALLS AND TRYING TO FIND THE RIGHT YOU CAN ASSIST THEM ONLY TO HAVE. QUEST EITHER IGNORED OR RESPONDED TO IN A PROMOTES FRUSTRATION PART OF LOCALS NON ANOTHER EXAMPLE HERE THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO JUST LAST WEEK. AND OPERATE. I FOR A POLITE THAT DID NOT CONDUCT BUSINESS DURING THE REVIEW PERIOD- DISREGARDED CITIES REQUEST. THE CLINTON HI A LOCAL LICENSE NOT WITHSTANDING WHILE THE LATER ULTIMATE RISK A PER ALLIES FROM THE STATE WHO INDICATED THE DESPITE BEING. BY CITY OF THE DEAD LOCAL. IS THAT. RIGHT THE- ON THIS ON THE RIGHT TO THE TERM IN AB TAKE ACTION OF THAT. IN THE MEAN CITIES LEFT THE AN OP. THAT HAS NOT AND WILL RECEIVE A APPROVE BUT CAN CONTINUE I ANY BECAUSE HAS A STATE A LIES. SO TO HELP SOME OF THESE ISSUES THAT SHOULD BE VERY CLEARLY OUTLINED AS TO WHO HAS THE AUTHORITY TO TAKE ACTION UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES THE LOCAL JURISDICTION OR THE STATE. AND IF IT IS THE LOCALS WHAT ACTION THEY CAN TAKE AND WHEN THEY ARE ALLOWED TO ACT. FINALLY ALL COMMERCIAL CANNABIS RELATED GRANTS SHOULD BE MADE AVAILABLE IN ONE PLACE. A SINCE LEGALIZATION THERE BEEN CAMPUS GRANT OPPORTUNITY OPPORTUNITIES- THAT HAVE BEEN POSTED WITHIN DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH GO VISIT CETERA- FOR CITIES IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT ALL GRANT FUNDING WHETHER INTENDED. FOR LOCAL ENFORCEMENT EQUITY PROGRAM. ORDNANCE CREATION OR ANY OTHER FORM OF IMPLEMENTATION BE MADE AVAILABLE IN A CENTRAL LOCATION. FOR EASE OF ACCESS BY ALL PERSONS IN THIS FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES. NOW THE FOR WANT CONSIDERATIONS AYE AYE LISTED ARE REALLY JUST A SMALL SAMPLE OF SOME PRELIMINARY. BACK THE THAT'S FAR. BUT I WOULD HOPE THAT THIS HEARING IS BUT THE FIRST THE- CONVERSATIONS THE WHAT. AARON PARTNERS THE SHARED. BETWEEN THE STATE. AND SO I THINK YOU'VE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY AND I'LL DO MY BEST TO ADDRESS IT. IF YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MS MARTIN YOU INDICATE THAT YOU HAD BEEN IN IN YOUR TO IN YOUR JUST YOU THAT YOU'RE NOT INCLUDED IN THE COMMERCE AND- FOR THE NEW IS THAT. YES YES AND A MISTER CLICK HARVEY IS THAT THE SAME FOR THE LEAGUE OF CITIES WE HAVE NOT BEEN INCLUDED NUMBER INCLUDE- THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT I THINK THAT'S PART OF THAT THE CHILD IS TO WHICH IS THE- THE IMPETUS FOR THIS INFORMATION HERE THAT WE CAN HAVE DIE TIONAL I LOG. MAY HER YOU MENTION THAT. COURSE YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE LOCALITIES RECEIVE MORE RESOURCES TO HELP ON ENFORCEMENT BUT BUT ABSENT THAT IT WOULD THEN BE THE STATE TO TAKE THAT ROLE. IN YOUR TO. YES I MEAN AND LESSEN UNTIL- THAT CITIES CAN RECEIVE SOME MORE ASSISTANCE OR AT LEAST MORE TOOLS TO HANDLE ON FORCING THEMSELVES. YES THEY WOULD DO FONG THE STATE I WOULD IMAGINE WE HOPE THAT THE STATE WOULD DO SOMETHING SURE. AND SO THERE IS INADEQUATE RESOURCES FOR LOCALS TO. REALLY TACKLES THE ISSUE ENFORCEMENT. IS THAT RIGHT YES AND YET YOU HEARD- ALSO. A FISH AS WELL AS MEMBERS THIS OF THE COMMITTEE. AND THIS INFORMATIONAL HEARING INDICATE THAT IT WAS. LOCALS THAT ARE BEST EQUIPPED. TO FOCUS ON THE ISSUE OF ENFORCEMENT. THERE IF I MAY- I THINK IT'S REALLY A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN CITIES COUNTIES AND THE STATE- AND AGAIN. GO BACK TO MY INITIAL POINT IN ORDER TO DO THAT IT'S NOT JUST FUNDING THAT WERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SHARING INFORMATION WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BETTER COORDINATION BETWEEN ALL. ENTITIES BECAUSE IT'S REALLY TAKE A. YOU HAVE TO DO IT SINCE IN SYSTEM AND IF AN OPERATOR ONE LINE AND HAVE ENOUGH. YOU KNOW IT COULD BE POTENTIALLY- YOU KNOW IT'S AN UP ALL THE REGULATORY PROGRAM- SO WE'RE NOT WE'RE TRYING TO PRIORITIZE ENFORCEMENT TO GO AFTER BAD ACTORS AND THEN ALSO SORT OUT WHICH TAKES COMMUNICATION COORDINATION. FOLKS THAT AB ARE OUT OF COMPOUND AND CAN COME BACKTO COMPLIANCE BUT REALLY WHAT YOU NEED IS A GREATER PARTNERSHIP TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT. AND DATA IS THE FOUNDATION OF THAT RIGHT SURE ANYTHING THAT'S IS THAT SIMILAR BY WE APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY HERE TODAY TO ILLUSTRATE THE PRINCE OF THE- SHIP. THAT WE NEED. PERSPECTIVE UNTIL LOCAL CONTROL YOU HAVE SEEN. PROPOSALS HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE LAST YEAR ON THAT OF LICENSING- WHISKEY LOCALITY IN HELPING ON THE- REGULAR MARKET PLACE AND THE PIPELINE. HOW FOR SEE THE ROLE OF LOCALS THE TO SAY THAT YOU YOU CAN SEE THE COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH AT THE STATE IS TRYING TO TACKLE. THE REGULAR MARKET PLACE THAT OF ENFORCEMENT. BUT ALSO IS THAT THE PIPELINE AND ACCESS ISSUES WE'RE WILL BE THING LOCALS PLAY IN TERMS OF APP HELPING TO ASSIST IN. RECOGNIZING THE ROLE THAT LOCALITY PLAY WITHIN THE WIDER SCHEME OF THE STATE. AGAIN I WELL SO THE FOUNDATION OBVIOUSLY- OF LOCAL CONTROLS AND PROP SIXTY FOUR AND IT ALLOWS COMMUNITIES TO DECIDE WHICH THEY ARE AND FRANKLY IT'S- YOU KNOW IMPACTING COUNCILS AND BOARD REPRESENTATION BECAUSE OF THIS ISSUE IS SO PROMINENT. COMMUNITY IS REALLY ALTERNATELY UP TO SECTION TO DECIDE HOW. AND WHEN THEY WANT TO REGULATE BUT IN ORDER WE'RE TAKING I THINK A MORE PROACTIVE AND INCENTIVE APPROACH FOR FOLKS THERE ARE NUMBER OF THOSE ON THE SIDELINES THAT ARE LOOKING TO THEIR NEIGHBORS TO SEE SORT OF. THE TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS THAT THEY'RE GOING THROUGH AND WAITING UNTIL THE SYSTEM IS SORTED OUT BECAUSE IT EVOLUTION. BUT WE CAN TRIED TO HELP JURISDICTIONS THAT ARE INTERESTED IN REGULAR AND PROVIDING GREATER ACCESS GETTING THAT 65270% NUMBER UP. HIGHER UP IN POPULATIONS. BUT THAT NEED A PROVIDES. WITH ABOUT AND SO LOCAL WHICH AND UP HER. DATE EASE OF. EASE OF INFORMATION AND BEFORE I THINK YOU YOU CAN LEAVE THE GOAL. POST PORT BUT TAKING THE APPROACH DOING THAT. MR GIPSON. THANK BUT CERTAINLY ENJOY. CONVERSATION THUS FAR QUESTION FOR THE PANEL THE- WORSE TODAY HOW DO YOU FEEL WILL. OF OPINION ABOUT THE SKIN SO. THIS IS HOW YOU DISEASE THANK DO YOU THINK THAT THIS EVEN FURTHER BURDENS THE INDUSTRY SO I'M JUST CURIOUS ABOUT YOUR THOUGHTS IN TERMS OF THIS PROPOSED CONSOLIDATION CHERYL JUMP IN AND THEN- TRUST CAN FILL IN FROM THE SAME PERSPECTIVE. I THINK IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY I THINK- HAVING THE PLETHORA OF AGENCIES THAT TOUCH ON CANNABIS REGULATION- LIVE AND EXIST IN VARIOUS DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES- DOESN'T HELP FOR BETTER COORDINATION SO CONSOLIDATING THEM INTO A SINGLE ENTITY PROVIDES THE OPPORTUNITY FOR A FISH AND SEA AND AGAIN THAT GREATER PARTNERSHIP WITH THE LOCAL LEVEL. BUT THAT'S ALSO INCLUDING FOLKS FROM FISH AND WILDLIFE AND THE WATER BOARD AND OTHER AREAS- THAT REALLY I THINK CAN POTENTIALLY DELAY THE PROCESS INTO THAT CONVERSATION HAVING POTENTIALLY LIAISONS WITH THAT TO. THAT'S WHY WE WANNA BE INCLUDED IN THIS. BECAUSE FROM THE INVITE. A REVIEW PERSPECTIVE WE HAVE A LOT OF EXPERTISE AND FRANKLY WERE A LOT OF THE DELAY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL SO WE NEED TO BE- AT THE TABLE WORKING THROUGH HOW BEST. TO ORGANIZE EVERYBODY FOR A GREATER OUTCOME. YEAH I WOULD AGREE- WITH PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING THAT THEY CARE SAID- I THINK WHEN YOU BRING A LOT OF THESE- WHEN YOU BRING THESE ENTITIES TOGETHER AND SYNTHESIZE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES ALL IT ONLY MAKES FOR- EASIER COMMUNICATION- TO AT LEAST FROM FROM CITIES TO. YOU KNOW FIGURE OUT WHO THEY NEED TO TALK TO. WHAT THEY NEED IN TERMS OF- IN THE WAY OF INFORMATION TO GET FROM A TO B. TO ACCOMPLISH THEIR TASK I MEAN. IT'S SO THEY CAN ONLY MAKE THINGS EASIER AND LET FOR I THINK WHAT MAKES IT EASIER IF WE HAVE THIS. THE CONSOLIDATION THAT'S BEING POLLS ACT. AM TO. HELP US TO. YES THOSE WHO ARE THE UNDER MARKET AND WE LOOK AT HOW DO WE NOT TAX THIS INDUSTRY OUT OF BUSINESS. TO ALLOW THE LEGAL MARKET TO INCREASE IN OUR COMMUNITIES THE POLITICAL RADAR COMMUNITIES AND SO WE REALLY HAVE A REAL ROBUST CONVERSATION ABOUT. HOW DO WE- NOT STRANGLE THIS INDUSTRY THIS EMERGING BECAUSE I THINK THAT WE HAVE NOT. EVEN SCRATCHES. IN TERMS OF BE A MAN SITTING WHAT THIS IN YEARS YOU CAN ACHIEVE IT WAS A LEGAL MARKET. FIRST HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND THE LEGAL MARKET OF THE MARK RUNNING RAMPANT IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND SO THAT'S WHAT I'M HOPING THAT- A CONSOLIDATION AS WELL AS COORDINATION DOES FOR US MOVING FORWARD. BUT WE THE LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN PART OF THAT THE LEGISLATURE CANNOT BE ABSENT THAT AND SO THAT'S WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR. THANK YOU. SO MY QUESTION IS HOW CAN WE HELP YOU HER NUMBER THERE'S NO LICENCES VERSUS THE NUMBER OF PERMIT LICENSES. IN THERE'S A- CLOGGED LOCAL LEVEL THROUGH SEQUEL OR OTHER ISSUES. HOW CAN WE HELP. THOSE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THE DEAL WITH THAT BACKLOG. WHAT FROM THE SECRET THAT'S KIND OF MORE OF A COUNTY- ISSUE I DO THINK THAT AB NINETY SEVEN THE TRAILER BILL AUSTER THAT PROVIDED THE TWO YEAR EXTENSION- FOR THE SECRETS SECTION FOR LOCAL PROGRAMS IS VERY HELPFUL. I THINK AND THE CREATION OF THE PROVISIONAL LICENSE WAS MATT REALLY TO GIVE ADDITIONAL TIME TO LOCAL JURISDICTIONS- TO COMPLETE THAT LAND USE PROCESS- YOU KNOW PART OF THE ISSUE IS THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER IT'S JUST A CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT WERE PLANNING DEPARTMENT THAT HOUSE. VIEW THESE PERMIT ON THIS WATER BOARD AHMED THERE'S FISH AND WILDLIFE INVOLVEMENT SO INCLUDING THOSE FOLKS IN ANY KIND OF CONSOLIDATED OR PERHAPS IN BEING UP SOME OF THEIR PROGRAMS OF THAT ADDITIONAL STAFF THEY CAN TACKLE THE NUMBER OF LICENSES- THAT THEY'RE GOING THROUGH IT WOULD BE HELPFUL IN THE STATE SIDE WE HAVE TO DO THE SAME. LIKE WHAT IS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WE'RE DOING THAT THROUGH- SHE AND TAX REVENUE BUT IN JURISDICTIONS LIKE HUMBLE MENDOCINO MONTEREY SANTA BARBARA THAT HAVE THOUSANDS OF CULTIVATION THIS IS. SOMETIMES RELATIVELY SMALL. IN APARTMENTS. IN ADDITION TIME THE STATE. I LEGISLATION PASSED LAST YEAR TO FOR PROVISIONAL I IS VERY HELPFUL TO US. THANK YOU FOR THE COMMITTEE. WILL HAVE NO UP THE PUBLIC COME. IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK OF THIS. CHAIR COOPER CHAIRMAN LOW IN MEMBERS AMY JENKINS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CANNABIS INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION I'M ALSO HERE ON BEHALF OF BLOOM FARMS AND CAN CRAFT FOR ALSO BOARD MEMBERS OF CCA- WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE REFORMS OUTLINED IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL- WE ARE A STRONG PROPONENT OF CONSOLIDATION. SPECIFIC AND I THINK IN LARGE PART THAT IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF COME ABOUT ENFORCEMENT TODAY WE HAVE LONG SUPPORTED A CENTRALIZED ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM A LOT OF THE EARNS WERE RAISED BY BY- THE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS TALKED ABOUT THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN. LICENSED AND LICENSE LICENSED ENFORCEMENT WE BELIEVE THAT THE LICENSEES HAVE- SUBJECT TO VERY ROBUST ENFORCEMENT TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE BUT THERE IS A VERY VERY THRIVING LIST GET CONTINUOUS I THINK THE FACT. THE BY CATION ENFORCEMENT IS REALLY PART OF THAT PROBLEM SO WE ARE HOPEFUL THAT AS PART OF CONSENT SHRIMP TESTED REAL FOCUSED IN CENTRAL FORCE. XIN PROPOSAL THE OTHER THING I THINK THAT'S REALLY IN. IS A THE BY. OF LICENSES WE THINKTHAT THROUGH CONSOLIDATION- WE WILL ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO REDUCE COSTS AND ADMINISTRATIVE BARRIERS TO ENTRY IT'S VERY VERY COSTLY TO GO THROUGH THAT BOTH THE STATE AND LOCAL PROCESS. APPLY FOR MULTIPLE LICENSES SO WE LIKE TO SEE- A LITTLE BIT MORE EMPHASIS ON SHOULD USE MORE BY FOR. LESS BY CATION- FOCUSING ON. SAYS CAN PROCESS CAN YOU MANY FACTURE ON THE C. PROMISES WERE HOPING AND CELEBRATION WILL IT PRESS A LOT. THIS ME I'M JUST GONNA MAKE A NOTE. TAX EXEMPT CASE PROCESS WE ARE A STRONG. OF TAX SIMPLIFICATION. THE AND WE THINK THAT WILL USE YOURS TO ENTRY. CURVE. I THINK A PART OF OUR ILLICIT MARKET PROBLEM IS THAT WE NEED TO BRING IMMEDIATE RELIEF TO CALIFORNIA STRUGGLING CANNABIS INDUSTRY THIS INCLUDES THE COMPLETE SUSPENSION OF THE CULTIVATION TAX. AND OTHER CONSIDERATIONS- THAT WILL RELIEF AND REDUCE THOSE TAXES THE IMPOSITION IN PARTICULAR FOR WEIGHT BASS CULTIVATION TAX REMAINS ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES FOR CANNABIS IN THE SAYS. AND A MAJOR MAJOR BARRIER TO ENTRY A COUPLE POINTS I JUST TO MAKE AS A RELATES TO SOME OF THE COMMENTS MADE ON THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT CHANNEL. I'M WITH. BILL PRODUCTS. ACCESS TO FORTY HIGHER THAN ONLINE PRODUCTS I I'VE FAILED TO SEE. HE'S S. TO LEGAL PRODUCTS THEY SUBJECT TRACK AND TRACE WE A DONE OF WHERE THAT PRO HAS BEEN USE ARE NOT PURCHASE THESE PA THEY ARE PRODUCING THEIR PART A MARK CHEAP PRICE AND THEN WITH RESPECT TO SEE SEE A AND SOME OF THE OTHER TOOLS THOSE ARE REALLY TARGETED AT LICENSED OPERATORS AND LAST ABOUT COLLECTING DATA IN MY AND SO WHILE WE DON'T HAVE AN STAND POSITION ON CCA AND SPECIFICALLY IT IS COSTLY AND IT'S A WEEKLY REPORTING DATA SYSTEM- AND DO YOU THINK THERE SHOULD BE MORE EMPHASIS ON COLLECTING DATA AND- BECAUSE- DO. AT ON LICENSE ACTIVITY AND I'LL ALSO TO WITH WERE TO. MORE RESOURCE TO LOOK WE SIR STRONG SUPPORT THAT AND WOULD WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTNER WITH THEM IF THAT MEANS A DRESSING UNLICENSED ACTIVITY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. THIS CHAIR IS A MEMBERS AROUND MARTIN ON BEHALF OF KHALIFA- FIRST OFF ON THE REORGANIZATION ISSUE- WE COMPLETE YOUR SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IN DOING THAT WE DO LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING- A ROLE TO PLAY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND WITH THE EXISTING REGULATORY BODIES IN TERMS OF PROVIDING INPUT TO THEM AS THEY'RE PUTTING THIS MODEL TOGETHER AND WORKING WITH YOUR STAFF AS WELL AS MOVE FORWARD. ON THE ISSUE OF THE ILLICIT MARKET- LET ME TELL YOU FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF PEOPLE WHO ARE ON THE GROUND RIGIDLY COMPLYING WITH REGULATIONS IS VERY DISCONCERTING AT TIMES DISCOURAGING I'M TO HAVE TO GO UP AGAINST A LIST OF MARKET COMPETITION- IT IN A VERY ROBUST WAY- WE WOULD WE WOULD BE MORE SUCCESSFUL AS AN INDUSTRY WE WERE LESS GOD. BLESS IMPACT BY IT BY THE MARKET THERE ARE THREE BUCKETS- THAT WE BELIEVE THAT YOU NEED TO FACE TO FACE IN ORDER TO FIX US AND I'M NOT TELL ANYTHING YOU DON'T KNOW NUMBER ONE THERE NOT ENOUGH TAX SYSTEM THERE ARE CAN DESERT ALL YOU USE AT THE CENTRAL AND HOW FOR UPPER THERE ARE FOR PEOPLE ACCESS LEGAL CAN. I MEAN THAT PART OF THE STATE WE NEED TO DO MORE NEED TO FIND THE MATCH SOLUTION TO GETTING MORE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO STEP UP THE END WHEN THE PROP SIXTY WORLD NUMBER TWO IS THAT WE NEED TO TAX REFORM TAX SIMPLIFICATION. OKAY SYMBOL. PORT BUT IF WE DO SOMETHING IN TERMS OF REAL WE'RE NOT GONNA WORK ON GOING TO MAKE IT. WHEN AB TALKS ABOUT THE- BETWEEN THE- OF LEGAL. AND ILLEGAL. IT IS A- BECAUSE OF THE TACK CONSERVE. I'M NOT A HUGE. PROBLEM FOR US I'M IN THIRD AND THANK YOU MISTER COOPER MISTER LOWE AND MISTER LACKEY ESPECIALLY FOR HIS VENTING- THE ENFORCEMENT PROBLEM IS HUGE- AND THE PROBLEM IS OR NOT. NOT UTTING ENOUGH RESOURCES ON IT I THINK YOUR POINTS MISTER COOPER ESPECIALLY ABOUT HOW MANY PEOPLE IT TAKES TO ISSUE FORTY FOUR. WARRANTS IS IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO HEAR- AND IMPORTANT FOR US TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT BECAUSE WE DON'T PUT THOSE RESOURCES. ON THE GROUND WITH SO OFFICE. DEAL I'M WE'RE NEVER GOING TO AHEAD OF THE- MARK. THANK YOU. THANK YOU I'M GOOD AFTERNOON I'M ON A CHAIRMAN IN. COMMITTEE HI MY NAME IS CHRIS OF IT ALL IN THE EXACT DIRECTOR WITH HERE NOW. CAN FARMERS AS- OUR MISSION IS TO AND TO CAN OF FARMERS THROUGH. ADVOCACY AND RESEARCH SO THEM. OF THE MEMBERS OF OUR ORGANIZATION OUR OUTDOOR MAKES LATE HERE ONE CULTIVATORS WHO TEND TO BE ON THE SMALL SIDE. I'M I'M- IS HEAVY IN MANY SEEN NO HOME WHAT COMPANIES AND ESPECIALLY NEVADA COUNTY. JUST TO GIVE YOU SOME KIND OF. VIEW OF WHO IT IS THAT WE WORK WITH ON A REGULAR BASIS- WHILE WE GREATLY GREATLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THE TAX SIMPLIFICATION. I'M MOVING THE CULTIVATION TAX TO THE- POINT OF COLLECTION OR THE FIRST DISTRIBUTION POINT. WOULD FURTHER ECONOMICALLY CHALLENGED CULTIVATORS SO THAT WOULD BE WELL BEFORE THE AWAY THE KURD AND BEFORE THE PRODUCT IS FOR SURE GOING TO BE. PATHWAY TO HAVE THOSE TECH READ TO THE- SO WHAT WE WOULD RECOMMEND THAT CASE IS A REAL JUST THIS. ELIMINATION OF THE CULTIVATION TAX WOULD GO LEAPS AND BOUNDS BEYOND THAT SORT OF THIS IMPLICATION EFFORT- REGARDING CONSOLIDATION- STREAMLINING IS THE WORD I LIKE TO USE BECAUSE STREAMLINING THE LICENSING PROCESS IS DEFINITELY NECESSARY- WE SUPPORT IN CONCEPT CONSOLIDATION BUT- ONLY IF THAT CONSOLIDATION OF. DOES NOT CREATE MORE BIFURCATION BETWEEN CANNABIS AND HEMP WHICH WE STILL HAVE COMING ONLINE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND ADDITIONALLY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE HAS A BROAD RANGE OF PROGRAMS THAT COULD BE BENEFICIAL TO CULTIVATORS. ON DOWN THE ROAD SUCH AS A COMMISSION SOME MARKETING ORDERS AGRICULTURAL COUNCILS BUT ALSO GRANT PROGRAMS THAT HELP TO SUPPORTTHE SUSTAINABILITY OF THE GREEN OF. XIN ARE FARMING OPTICIANS. I'M AND I YOU KNOW A LOT OF. POINTS ABOUT. HIS INTERNALLY LICENSE SO RIGHT NOW WE'VE GOT CULTIVATOR THAT ARE FOR TO GET CALL MY BECAUSE THEY CAN PULL A LIGHT TAR IN OUTDOOR TEAR THEN THEY CALL TO OUTDOOR IN A LIGHT UP TIER I KNOW THAT'S KIND OF HIGH LEVEL BY I IN FORCE MULTIPLE. UPON LICENSEES THAT DON'T HAVE A LOT OF RETURN ON THEIR INVESTMENT OR ABILITY TO ECONOMICALLY NAVIGATE THE LICENSE SYSTEM SO I'M THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IF YOU. THANKS TEARS COMMITTEE MEMBERS IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU GO AGAIN IT'S BEEN A WHILE I'M MY NAME'S HAS A CHI ALLEN LAST TIME I APPROACHED YOU ARE I SPOKE TO USE REPRESENTING AN ASSOCIATION NOW I'M A LICENSEE- PENDING APPROVAL FROM CD HEY HOLD A LICENSE FROM BCC SEATING PH AND ALSO WORK WITH AN AGRICULTURAL CO OP OF FORTY TWO LICENSED GROWERS- IT'S FOR US TO TAKE A POSITION ON THE BUDGET PROPOSAL CURRENTLY BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T SEEN A PROPOSAL. THE INTENTION OF CONSOLIDATION IS GREAT STREAMLINING SOUNDS FANTASTIC BUT BUT LET'S BE REAL WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND SPECIFICITY HERE THERE'S A LOT MORE TO BEING A FARMER THAN JUST OBTAINING A LICENSE CALIFORNIA APART OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE HAS A MANDATE TO PROTECT AND PRINT OF THE AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY IN THE STATE AND DO A HECK OF A GOOD JOB YOU CAN LOOK IT HI OF BODIES THAT WE LEAD THE WAY IN CANNABIS ISN'T ONE OF THOSE COME. IN THERE'S NO BETTER AGENCIES WE LIVE. THE CALIFORNIA. PUT IN AGRA. BRANCH MANAGER PARROT DESPITE SOME JUST. IN THE PAST IS THAT I HAVE OF A JOB LEADING THE BRANCH AND I THAT THE- SHOULD SHOULD BE. FRONT CENTER IN THIS PROCESS GOING FOR. TO THE CONCEPT OF AN- AND THE IDEA OF THE CARROT AND THE STICK I CAN TELL YOU WITH CERTAINTY THAT GIVING THE LICENSING AGENCIES A BROADER ENFORCEMENT MANDATE WILL NOT ENCOURAGE MORE PARTICIPATION. THERE'S ALREADY A TREMENDOUS FEAR MONTHS THE ON LICENSE BUSINESS COMMUNITY THAT SEEKING TO GET A LICENSE WILL BE THE TRIGGER FOR ENFORCEMENT. IN FACT WE HAVE WORKED WITH GROWERS WHO OBTAINED A WATER BOARD PERMIT AND HEARD FROM THE SHERIFF THE NEXT WEEK WE HAVE SEEN. THE ATTEMPT TO GET ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF REGULATION LEAD TO ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITY COUPLING THOSE TWO ACTIVITIES WILL DISCOURAGE BROADER PARTICIPATION. WOULD PERHAPS BE WISE TO EXPLORE MORE EFFECTIVE ENFORCEMENT. ACTIONS THAT THE STATE COULD TAKE BUT TO ME. MUDDY THE WATERS OF LICENSURE WITH THAT MANDATE SEEMS INCREDIBLY PROBLEMATIC IN SHORT I AND ARE STILL IN A PHASE WHERE COURAGE AND- PARTS. FROM THE BASE UNITY IS TO BE. WE NEED THAT RELIEF TO CENTER IT WOULD BE FOLLY. EXPECT AND FORCED COULD SAW THIS. FOR FORTY YEARS OF A EXT. ENFORCED APPROACH TO. ON ITS AND FORTY NINETEEN EIGHTEEN AS ONE CAN. MOVED TO THE VICIOUS LEADING THE WAY TO COOLEY WE- THINK IF. QUITE A TIME HAVEN'T TRIED. IS LOW BARRIERS ENTRY. FOR TO PARTICIPATE. WHEN IT IS THE TIME. I THINK ANY I DON'T. SPEAK MORE I'LL BE CLEAR. ARE HOPEFUL YOU CAN SENSE IT THE UNIT IN THE TAX BURDEN IS HOW. BY THE TIME UP. TO MARKET ON SOME SOME CHAINS IN OUR STATE THE- BIRD ON THAT PRODUCT IS IT AS MUCH AS SEVENTY TO EIGHTY PER. OF THE- VALUE THAT'S CERTAINLY AN EXTREME CASE BUT THAT ANALYSIS DOES EXIST IF WE WERE TO TAKE A- AT IT. SING MATTERS A LOT CONSUMER CERTAINLY CONVENE STYLE TôI DOES AND WE HAVE A- BETTER. TO DO TO AND THAT LEAD IS. REGULATION IS FELT AND IN ALL. AROUND THIS. BUT UNTIL WE CAN GET THIS TO PROBLEM UNDER CAN IT'S GOING TO BE A REAL UP HILLS SWIM US. ALL SAY THEY ALL A THE CHALLENGES FOR. MY BUSINESS RIGHT NOW- AGAIN HOLDING LICENSES FROM TWO OF THE AGENCIES UNDER REVIEW FROM THE THIRD AGENCY. AGENCY CONSOLIDATION WOULD NOT BE HIGH ON MY LIST. IT'S NOT A PRIORITY THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER THINGS WE NEED TO DO IT'S A HALF COOKED PROPOSAL AT BEST. THE INDUSTRY HAS BEEN CONSULTED BROAD THIS IS THE LEGISLATURE IN THE LOW GOVERNMENT HAVE. GOT A LOT MORE WORK TO DO ON THIS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET. SURE THAT WE DON'T THE BAY OUT THE BATHROOM. THE MULTI AGE. FRAMEWORK WHICH- RIGHT.
