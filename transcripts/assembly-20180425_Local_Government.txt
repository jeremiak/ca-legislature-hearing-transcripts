GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT TO YOU ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTY ONE SIXTY EIGHT WHICH WILL EXEMPT THE SALE OR LEASE OF SPECIFIC FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PROPERTIES FROM THE REQUIREMENT THAT THE STATE. THAT THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION IS GIVEN THE FIRST RIGHT OF REFUSAL A RULE THAT WAS CREATED THREE SB FIFTY LAST YEAR. AB THIRTY ONE SIXTY PROVIDES A VERY LIMITED EXEMPTION FROM SPECIFIC FEDERAL MILITARY INSTALLATIONS IN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE PARTICIPATING WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND THE BASE REALIGNMENT AND CLOSURE. ACHEI BRAK TRANSFER AND REDEVELOPMENT PROGRAM MY DISTRICT IS HOME TO ONE OF THESE FORMER BASIS THE CONCORD NAVAL WEAPONS STATION. THE CITY OF CONCORD IS THE LOCAL RE USE AUTHORITY FOR THIS FORMER NAVAL BASE AND HAS BEEN WORKING WITH THE U. S. NAVY FOR OVER THIRTEEN YEARS ON THE BASIS TRANSFERRED TO LOCAL CONTROL. A. B. THIRTY ONE SIXTY WOULD EXEMPT THIS FEDERAL PROPERTY FROM RECENTLY ENACTED STATE LAW S. B. FIFTY TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WHICH WILL ENABLE THE CITY OF CONCORD TO COMPLETE THE FEDERAL TRANSFER PROCESS. AS PART OF THE CITIES WE USE PROJECT THE BILL RECEIVED BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IN ASSEMBLY NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE AND FOR THIS REASON I ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AND I DO HAVE GUEST. WELL ALLOW YOU TO SO PRODUCE COMETA PRIOR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS GUY PURITY. AND THE DIRECTOR COMMUNITY WE USE PLANNING FOR THE CITY OF CONCORD. A WE THINK THAT BRACH TRANSFERS IN REDEVELOPMENT PROJECTS NOW TAKING PLACE THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA ARE DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT FROM THE TYPES OF FEDERAL LAND TRANSFERS TO THIRD PARTY SO LEGISLATURE. AND THE GOVERNOR SOUGHT TO OVERSEE WHEN YOU ENACTED S. B. FIFTY LAST YEAR. BARBARA TRANSFER IN REDEVELOPMENT PROJECTS WILL NOT THREATEN ANY NATIONAL FOREST PARKS OR OTHER NATURAL RESOURCES IN FACT OUR GOAL IS TO CREATE A TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT. AROUND THE NORTH CONCORD BART STATION WHICH WILL PROVIDE JOBS AFFORDABLE HOUSING HABITAT CONSERVATION AREAS REGIONAL AND LOCAL PARKS. AND A FUTURE SITE FOR A UNIVERSITY CAMPUS. WE THINK THIS. EXEMPTION WHICH WOULD STILL REQUIRE THE APPROVAL OF THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION IS INAPPROPRIATE EXEMPTION WITHOUT UNDERMINING VIA TED.

GRAYSON AYE LACKEY LACKEY AYE STONE VOEPEL. MEASURES OUT FIVE ZERO. AGAIN WE ARE GOING TO GO OUT OF ORDER HERE LITTLE BIT AND WE'RE GOING TO TAKE ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOM SPILL AND THAT IS ITEM NUMBER. WHA ITEM NUMBER ONE OF SEVENTEEN SEVENTY ONE. I DON'T THINK I WITNESSED A FAIR BUT LET'S LET'S WING IT. SPEAK SLOWLY. WELCOME. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS SO LET ME START OFF BY. IT'S COMMITTEE HAVE AMENDMENTS YEAH I'M LOOKING AT THEIR NOTES FROM THE PRIOR COMMITTEE. SO FORGET ABOUT THAT BUT I WAS HAPPY TO TAKE AMENDMENTS IN THE PRIOR COMPLETELY. AND HOW. WE HAVE MAN ACCOMPLISHMENTS LAST YEAR ON THE HOUSING ISSUE INCLUDING AB THIRTEEN NINETY SEVEN OF WHICH I WAS A JOINT AUTHORED S. B. THIRTY FIVE OF COURSE. AND SEVERAL OTHER BILLS BUT THESE BILLS THAT MEAN VERY LITTLE IF THE STATE RINA ALLOCATIONS ARE NOT EQUITABLE AND DATA DRIVEN BECAUSE THEY. DEPEND ON OUR RINA PROCESS. FAIR AND ACCURATE REALLOCATION IS THAT ENSURE EVERY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS PLAYING A PART IN ADDRESSING THE HOUSING CRISIS IS THE MAIN GOAL OF AB SEVENTEEN SEVENTY ONE. THE EXISTING PROCESS TOO OFTEN IGNORES THAT DATA AND ALLOWS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO PUSH BACK TO WHAT THEY'RE COMFORTABLE WITH. RATHER THAN WHAT THEY COULD ACTUALLY ACCOMMODATE WITH CHANGES IN ZONING. IN AN EFFORT TO ADD AN INDEPENDENT VOICE AB SEVENTEEN SEVENTY ONE ADDS EIGHT CD TO THE RAIN A PROCESS. THAT ALLOWS THEM TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE DISTRIBUTION METHODOLOGY IS CONSISTENT ITH THE LAW BEFORE THE NUMBERS ARE EVEN RUN SO THAT THE COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS TO THE. THE NEXT STAGE OF THE PROCESS OR ONE STAGE OF THE PROCESS CAN MAKE. ANY NEEDED CHANGES. THE EXISTING PROCESS PROVIDES A LOOPHOLE THAT CAN ALLOW POLITICS TO OVERRIDE PROCESS UNFORTUNATELY BUYING CLUED IN LANGUAGE THAT ALLOWS FOR. A COUNCIL GOVERNMENT TO ADD. A ANY OTHER FACTORS TO THEIR DISTRIBUTION METHODOLOGY AT THIS BILL NARROWS THAT DEFINITION SO THAT. ANY OTHER FACTORS WELCOME. A AYE KHAGARIA AT A REQUIRES THAT ALL FACTORS BE CONSISTENT WITH THE GOALS OF THE STATUTE SO THAT CONSISTENCY REQUIREMENT WILL BE VERY HELPFUL. A THIS BILL ALLOWS ORGANIZATIONS TO CHALLENGE RAIN IN NUMBERS AS WELL AS SURROUNDING JURISDICTIONS EXISTING GREEN ALLOCATIONS CAN ONLY BE CHALLENGED BY GUESS WHO THE JURISDICTION THAT ASSIGNED THE RENUMBER THE FIRST PLACE. IT'S A SYSTEM THAT HASN'T QUITE WORKED FOR US OF THE WAY IT SHOULD IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT RENOWNED SETS A AND HOUSING ALLOCATION FLOOR NOT A CEILING. AND RINA AS A PLANNING TOOL THAT'S CRITICAL TO SETTING THE STAGE FOR HOUSING PRODUCTION OF THE PROCESS ITSELF IS FLAWED. THEN WE DON'T GET HOUSING IN THE PLACES WHERE IT'S MOST NEEDED IN SOME CITIES. DO NOT HAVE TO CONTRIBUTE TO ADDRESSING REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS AND THAT'S SIMPLY WRONG WHEN JOB RICH JURISDICTIONS DON'T HAVE TO PLAN FOR HOUSING IT COMPROMISES OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR CLIMATE CALLS AS WELL. SO THIS BILL IS FOCUSED ON GETTING AN EQUITABLE RINA DISTRIBUTION WITHIN REGIONS THAT INSURERS EVERY JURISDICTION IS DOING ITS FAIR SHARE. AND BY A. AND HAPPY TO INTRODUCE TO YOU ON YOUR LAWLER. ON WHO'S JUST ARRIVED FROM THE WINNER WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY SHE MAY BE OUT OF BREATH. THE ELEVATORS NO WELL HOW. TODAY IS THEY ARE A. GOOD AFTERNOON THEM TURN MEMBERS ON YELLOW ON BEHALF THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY ONE OF THE SPONSORS OF THIS BILL. I'M SO THERE'S NO QUESTION THE CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO PRODUCE FARMER HOUSING THAN WE HAVE THEN AND PARTICULARLY HOUSING AFFORDABLE TO LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS WHERE THE CURRENT SHORTAGE IS BY FAR THE MOST ACUTE. BUT AS MISS ROOMS THAT IN ADDITION TO PAVING THE WAY FOR MORE PRODUCTION GENERALLY WE NEED TO PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO WHERE THE HOUSING IS ACTUALLY NEEDED AND ENSURE THAT THOSE PLACES ARE PROVIDING AMPLE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THAT DEVELOPMENT TO OCCUR. A HOW THE RING TO GET ALLOCATED WITHIN A REVIEW A REGION IS CRUCIAL TO SETTING THE STAGE FOR HOUSING DEVELOPMENT IN PREPARING THEIR HOUSING ELEMENT CITIES AND COUNTIES HAVE TO SHOW THAT THEY HAVE ENOUGH SITES ON FOR HOUSING TO ACCOMMODATE THEIR ENTIRE SHARE THE RENOWNED. AND IN PARTICULAR TO SO THEY CAN ACCOMMODATE THEIR LOWER INCOME SHARE THEY HAVE HAVE MULTI FAMILY. DANCE SITES. THE LAW RECOGNIZES THE CITIES AND COUNTIES GENERALLY AREN'T IN THE BUSINESS OF HOUSING DEVELOPMENT BUT THEY DO PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE THROUGH THEIR SENDING POWERS AND SETTING THE STAGE FOR DEVELOPMENT TO HAPPEN. I THE LAW PROVIDES A LOT OF PROTECTIONS FOR HOUSING PROJECTS BOTH HURDLE IN MARKET RATE THAT ARE PROPOSED ON SITES THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN DONE FOR HOUSING. THOSE PROTECTIONS WERE ENHANCE QUIT LAST YEAR THROUGH A NUMBER OF BILLS ON HOUSING PACKAGE ESSENTIALLY IF A DEVELOPER PROPOSES A HOUSING PROJECT PROJECT IN A LOCATION THAT IS ZONED FOR HOUSING ALREADY. VERY DIFFICULT FOR THAT PROJECT TO GET TONIGHT HOWEVER NO THESE LAWS CAN COMPEL PRODUCTION OF HOUSING A PLACE IS WHERE THERE IS LITTLE OR NO LEON SOUND FOR HOUSING IF A JURISDICTION GETS A LORENA NUMBER THAT EFFECTIVELY CAN MEAN THAT THE JURISDICTION CAN SHUT THE DOOR. FOR HOUSING DEVELOPMENT FOR THE NEXT DECADE EVEN IF IT'S AN IDEAL LOCATION FOR NEW HOUSING. THAT'S WHY IT'S SO CRITICAL TO GET THE REALLOCATION RIGHT. THE RENO SUPPOSED TO BE DISTRIBUTED OF A DATA DRIVEN WAY THAT MEANS A VARIETY OF STATUTORY GOALS UNFORTUNATELY REGIONAL POLITICS TAKE OVER RESULTING IN LOWALLOCATIONS TO JURISDICTIONS THAT COULD AND NEED TO ACCOMMODATE MORE HOUSING. AND OFTEN OVERLY HIGH ALLOCATIONS TO OTHER JURISDICTIONS WHERE THAT DEVELOPMENT REALLY DOESN'T MAKE A LOT OF SENSE AND IS UNLIKELY TO OCCUR BECAUSE OF MARKET CONDITIONS LACK OF JOBS A WHOLE BUNCH OF OTHER FACTORS. IF WE'RE GONNA START LOOKING AT HOW CLOSE PRODUCTION COMES IN CITIES AND COUNTIES TO MATCHING THEIR RENO SHARE AND USE THAT AS A. GAUGE FOR DEFINING SUCCESS AND FAILURE. AS WE DID LAST YEAR WITH SB THIRTY FIVE THAT WE HAVE TO START BY ENSURING THAT THE REALLOCATION MAKES SENSE. THE GOAL OF THIS BILL IS NOT TO CREATE MORE WORK FOR THE BECAUSE. WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE RINA PROCESS IS ALREADY RATHER TIME CONSUMING FOR THE COGS. AND WE DON'T CREATE ANY MORE WORK FOR THEM BUT. THE GOAL IS TO TAKE POLITICS OUT ENSURE THEY'RE PLANNING FOR HOUSING IN THE RIGHT PLACES AND THE COMMUNITIES WHERE MORE HOUSING MAKES SENSE ARE ASKED TO DO THEIR FAIR SHARE. WE'RE COMMITTED TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE CARDS MAY FOR THE BILL DOESN'T ADD TIME AND MORE WORK AND DOESN'T CREATE CONFLICT BETWEEN CLIMATE GOALS AN EQUABLE THE. EQUITABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS IN FACT WE THINK THAT IF WE GET THE REAL ALLOCATIONS RATE IT WILL HAVE AN OVERALL BENEFIT IN TERMS OF MEETING CHICHI REDUCTION TARGETS. WELL I UNDERSTAND THEIR CONCERNS FROM BOTH STAKEHOLDERS AND MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE ABOUT CHANGES TO THE PROCESS FOR APPEALING A REALLOCATION. AND A PARTICULAR OPENING UP THAT PROCESS TO CHALLENGES FROM ENTITIES OTHER THAN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. WHILE WE DO THINK EXISTING APPEAL PROCESS IS FLAWED WERE DEATHLY OPENED OTHER APPROACHES AND IN FACT HOPE THAT IN THE END WE CAN COME UP WITH A PROCESS THAT'S BOTH LESS TIME CONSUMING THAN THE ONE THAT EXISTS NOW AND MORE FAIR. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT BY PLACING MORE SCRUTINY ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE READ A METHODOLOGY ITSELF THERE'LL BE LESS NEED FOR APPEALS AT THE END OF THE PROCESS. OTHERS CLEARLY MARKED COME ON THIS BILL AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO THOSE CONVERSATIONS WE DEFINITELY WANT TO GET THIS RIGHT THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND WELCOME BRING ALONG WITH THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING CONSORTIUM PLEASED TO SUPPORT THE BELL WHICH WILL OPEN UP IN PARTICULAR AREAS OF HIGH OPPORTUNITY TO FORTY HOUSING DEVELOPERS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS SYLVIA SOLELY SEAN BEHALF THE CITY OF SANTA MONICA WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS MEASURE AS WE BELIEVE IT WILL RESULT IN MORE EQUITABLE READ ALLOCATIONS. AND ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS HAULING MICHON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF WEST HOLLYWOOD ALSO IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. MICHAEL A WITH THE NONPROFIT HOUSING ASSOCIATION ON THE CALIFORNIA STRONG SUPPORT. SENATE GEORGIA THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION I'M WE HAVE X. ACTUALLY HAVE A SUPPORTIVE AMENDED BUT ONLY SO WE CAN BE PART OF THE CONTINUING DISCUSSION BUT WE DO SUPPORT IT. THINKING. I ASSISTANCE AND ON BEHALF CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION WE APPRECIATE THE WILLINGNESS OF THE AUTHOR STAFF AND THE SPONSORS A TO ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS AND WITH THE FUTURE AMENDMENTS WILL BE GOING TO TRIAL. ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE OF THOSE OF THAT OPPOSE THE BILL. UP BILL HIGGINS WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION COUNCILS OF GOVERNMENT AND WE HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION. LARGELY BECAUSE OF ALL THE POINTS THAT. REPRESENTED FROM THE WESTERN CENTER RAISED ARE BASICALLY ARE POINTS THAT THEY'RE WORKING ON SO SHE ANTICIPATED MY TALK VERY MUCH. I WOULD SAY THAT I WORK OKAY YEAH. TOOK THAT THAT THAT A CLASSIC SHE TOOK ALL MY LINES. BUT DO A COUPLE THINGS BECAUSE OUR MANY OF BECAUSE ARE ALSO THE METROPOLITAN PLANNING ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE CHARGED WITH. DEVELOPING THEIR PLANS UNDER S. B. THREE SEVENTY FIVE MY CLIMATE REDUCTION PLANS. AND SO THAT RECONCILIATION POINT BETWEEN THE TWO IS VERY IMPORTANT TO US BECAUSE. IF CHARGED AS THE LEGISLATURE A OR B. WITH THE PRETTY AGGRESSIVE TARGET TO REDUCE GHGS BY TWENTY FIFTY AND THEY'RE ON IT THEY'RE DOING THAT NOW HOLDING OUR FEET TO THE FIRE. AND YOU'RE ó WITH BILLS LIKE THIS YEAR OLD CHARGING US ALSO TO DO IN EQUITY DISTRIBUTION. AND EIGHT CITIES GOING TO BE ON IT. AND WE THINK THAT THOSE ARE APPROVED THINGS COULD CONFLICTS SOMETIMES IN TERMS OF HOW WE CAN ACHIEVE OUR TARGET AND WE DO NEED A WAY TO FIGURE THAT OUT. WOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT. CLOGS. DO NOT RECEIVE ANY FUNDING SO WE APPRECIATE FOR THE RING UP SO WE APPRECIATE THE THE. NOT MAKING THIS MORE DIFFICULT BUT WE ARE PROHIBITED BY THE COMMISSION STATE MANDATES PER GETTING ANY KIND OF MANDATE REIMBURSEMENT FOR THE WORK THAT WE DO. AND SO WE APPRECIATE THAT FINALLY ON THIS COMMITTEE IN THIS ISSUE IS IT'S POINTED OUT IN THE ANALYSIS. UP WE WOULD LOOK FORWARD TO A COMMITMENT TO WORK TO AN ALTERNATIVE TO IN INTRODUCING THIRD PARTIES INTO THE PROCESS OF APPEALING AND FINDING A NARROWER RANGE TO ADDRESS THE PRINCIPLES. THAT THAT I THINK THEY'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE. BECAUSE THE RTP TIMELINE IT YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO ADOPT THE RESULT TRANSPORTATION PLAN IN A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME IF GOING TO DELIVER THE TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS. CRITICALLY WITH S. B. ONE AROUND. SO WOULD THAT TIME WHEN IT'S REALLY TIGHT IN COORDINATED. AND ADDING TIME AND DELAY TO THAT PROCESS COULD DELAY THE OUT COME OF THAT'S WE NEED TO FIGURE THAT OUT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS SHE'S FRIENDLY CALIFORNIA CITIES AND WHICH YOU DON'T HAVE A POSITION YOU KNOW IF IT'S AN CONVERSATIONS WITH THE SPONSORED. AND I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS WITH A COUPLE THINGS THAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT A WE CERTAINLY MAKE SURE THE ALLOCATION IS CORRECT. AND WE THINK THE PROCESS NOW IT MAY BE ISN'T ISN'T THE BEST AND IS AND ALWAYS BASED IN REALITY MOST IMPORTANTLY DEMAND IN THAT COMMUNITY. SO I THINK YOU KNOW MAKING SURE THAT WE ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES THAT WILL BE KEY UMBELS AFFLECK FOR THE WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR AND AND AND MAKE IT INTO A BILL THAT WE CAN POTENTIALLY SUPPORT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION SAYING NOT OTHER QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE. ACT AND ASSEMBLYMAN GRAYSON THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOM AYE. WHOLEHEARTEDLY APPLAUD YOU AND YOUR EFFORT TO WORK WITH A BILL WITH RING THAT IN ITSELF. AND THAT TO TRY TO MAKE IT A BIT MORE PRODUCTIVE IN A TOOL THAT ACTUALLY GET SOMETHING DONE. EYES ó WITH THAT JUST WOULD ALSO EXPRESS MY MY CONCERN OR CAUTION OVER THE ISSUE OF THIRD PARTY. ONLY FOR THE SAKE THAT WE HAVE ANOTHER ACTING CALIFORNIA THAT IS USED QUITE OFTEN. BY THIRD PARTIES THAT DOES ADD. EXTENSIVE TIME ONTO A PROJECT OR COMPLETELY TAKES IT OUT OF THE REALM OF PENCILING OUT. SO. WOULD EXPRESS MY CONCERN ABOUT THAT I SUPPORT YOUR BILL AND. LOOK FOR TO SEEING HOW A TIE INS UP AS OPPOSED TO THE PROCESS. YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. WE NEED A MOTION. MONTEBELLO FROM ASSEMBLYMEMBER GRAYSON.

LACKEY KNOWS STONE VOEPEL. IT'S ON KALRA YOU WAY FOR OTHERS TO COME IN TODAY ALRIGHT LET'S MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER TWELVE AB TWENTY NINE IT A TWO ASSEMBLY MEMBER GLORIA. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERSOF THE COMMITTEE HERE PRESENT AB TWENTY NINE EIGHTY TWO WHICH WOULD AT A NON VOTING MEMBER TO THE NORTH COUNTY TRANSIT DISTRICT'S BOARD. NOTHING IT'S ET BECAUSE ALL THOUSAND HOURS IN CT. ARE AT THE TIME OF IN CD'S CREATION BY THIS A LEGISLATURE IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE THE AGENCY DID NOT SERVICE THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO AND THEREFORE THERE WAS NO NEED TO INCLUDE REPRESENTATION FROM THAT JURISDICTION ON ITS BOARD. HOWEVER IN CT NOW SERVICES THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO THROUGH THE. IT'S COASTER SERVICE A TRAIN OF SERVICE. AS WELL AS BUS SERVICE IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO TO HAVE A DIRECT LINE OF COMMUNICATION FOR THE HAPPENINGS OF THIS AT THIS AGENCY. BUT BY ADDING. THAT BY ADDING A NON VOTING MEMBER FOR THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO WE HOPE TO ENGAGE FURTHER OF THIS ORGANIZATION WITH REGARD TO ISSUES LIKE STATION MAINTENANCE EXPANSION PLANS AND OTHER OPERATING PRACTICES. ON THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO STREETS IN IN ITS IN THAT ENVIRONMENT WITH HIS JURISDICTION WITH ME TODAY HAVE ONE WITNESS OUT CONSTITUENT JANET ROGERS SHE IS A MEMBER THE TRAIN COALITION OF OF THE STATE AT SANTA FE DEPOT. THIS COALITION REPRESENTS RESIDENTS WHO LIVE ADJACENT TO ONE OF THE STATIONS OPERATED OR THAT IS UTILIZED US I SHOULD SAY UTILIZED BY NCT. ROCKMAN JANET. WHO WHO THANK YOU? MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS THE TURN COALITION OF SANTA FE DEPOT THANK YOU FOR HEARING AB TWENTY NINE EIGHTY TWO. AND THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR FOR INTRODUCING THIS IMPORTANT BILL. WHEN NORTH COUNTY TRANSIT DISTRICT NCT DE WAS CREATED. BOARD MEMBERSHIP REFLECTED THE JURISDICTION OF THE TRANSIT AGENCY. IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE WHEN THE COASTER TRAINS STARTED OPERATING IN THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO. THE BOARD MEMBERSHIP WAS NOT AMENDED TO REFLECT THE EXTENDED JURISDICTION. THIS PROPOSAL ADJUST VERY LEGISLATION CREATES A MATCH BETWEEN WHERE NCT DE OPERATES AND REPRESENTATION ON THIS BOARD. WE SUPPORT AND INA NON VOTING MEMBER TO NCT DE. WE SEE THIS LEGISLATION AS A WIN WIN SITUATION. THE ADDITION OF A NON VOTING BOARD MEMBER GIPSON CTD A SUPPORTER FOR EXPANSION PLANS IN SAN DIEGO AND FOR STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDING REQUEST SPECIALLY FOR NEW EQUIPMENT. THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO GAINS KNOWLEDGE IN INPUT OPPORTUNITIES INTO THE COASTERS OPERATIONS IN SAN DIEGO. AND MORE INSIGHT INTO MCT DAYS MAINTENANCE BUDGET RESPONSIBILITIES. THREE OF THE A COASTER STATIONS ARE IN THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO. AND NCT DE HAS MAINTENANCE RESPONSIBILITIES FOR EACH OF THE STATIONS IN FACT NCT DE HAS SOLE RESPONSIBILITY. FOR MAINTAINING THE COASTER AN AMTRAK TRANSIT COURTYARD IT'S AN OF A DEPOT IN AREAS CONSIDER REGIONAL ASSET THE LINEAR PARK. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION AND WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT THE BABY TWENTY NINE EIGHTY TWO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. NEW WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE. YES ASSEMBLYMEMBER WALDRON. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU. MISTER GLORIA FOR YOUR STAFF WAS VERY RESPONSIVE TO SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WE HAD AND. I'M JUST WONDERING. WHY OF TO TWENTY THREE YEARS? BEING REQUESTED. I WOULD BE HAPPY AND SET. UP WAS BECAUSE THE EXPAND THE INSIDIOUS EXPANDED SERVICES WITHIN THE JURISDICTION OF THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO. I'M I DON'T RESPECT THE FACT HE SERVED ON THIS BOARD. AWHILE BACK. AND I THINK SOME OF THE OPERATION TO HAPPEN AT THAT TIME THESE OPERATIONS INCREASINGLY AS YOU MIGHT IMAGINE YOU KNOW RAISES CONCERNS AND OF CONSTITUENTS AND OF STAKEHOLDERS WITHIN THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO. YOU KNOW I WILL SAY I HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH THE STAFF IN CT BY THINK THIS HAS OF THIS REQUIRES MORE FORMAL RELATIONSHIP WHICH THE CREATURE THAT'S OFFICIO SEAT WILL ALLOW. OUT FOR THE ADDRESS DE DRESSING OF THESE CONSTITUENT LEVEL CONCERNED THINGS ABOUT OPERATIONS NOISE OF MY. BUT ALSO AS JANET WAS GETTING TO ABOUT THE PLANS FOR EXPANSION OF THE POTENTIAL SERVICES. THROUGHOUT THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO AND THAT KIND OF COOPER OF ELATION SHOULD COME ONLY HELP IN CITY CARRY OUT ITS MISSION OF TRANSPORTING SAN DIEGANS AROUND THE REGION. BECAUSE ONE I I SPEAK WITH NORTH COUNTY TRANSIT DISTRICT. YOU KNOW WHEN I WAS ON THE HAVE EXTENDED PLANNING BUT. I HAVEN'T REALLY LOOKED TO INCREASE SERVICE. ON THE COASTER ANYMORE THAN THEY HAVE MEAN IT'S WAY OUT IN THE FUTURE. WHAT I WOULD? IS YOU KNOW I SERVE ON THE CITY COUNCIL AND CITY SAN DIEGO FOR EIGHT YEARS A DURING THAT TIME WAS APPROACH MULTIPLE TIMES BY IN CT TO BUILD AN ADDITIONAL OF. A TRAIN PLATFORM AT THE CONVENTION CENTER BY THAT WOULD BE AN EXPANSION OF SERVICES DEEPER INTO THE HEART OF DOWNTOWN SAN DIEGO BUT IS NOT WITHOUT IMPACTS BY AND IS NOT A PRODUCT OF THE EASILY EXECUTE IT WITHOUT THE. I THINK DIRECT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CITY AND THIS AGENCY AGAIN I'M NOT REPRESENTED THERE'S A BAD RELATIONSHIP THAT THERE BUT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS HAVE A DEEPER RELATIONSHIP ONE THAT ALLOWS FOR MORE FREQUENT COMMUNICATION. NOT THE AD HOC INFORMAL NATURE THAT WE HAVE NOW THAT FRANKLY. ALMOST IS PUBLIC FIND ON CERTAIN DAYS DOESN'T REALLY HELP AND JANET HER NEIGHBORS ARE PROBABLY A PRETTY GOOD EXAMPLE OF THAT A GIVEN SOME OF THE. I THINK QUALITY BY CONCERNS IF THEY EXPERIENCE DALY TODAY IN DOWNTOWN SAN DIEGO. THIS ONE I SERVED ON THE BOARD WAS AT THAT TIME WHEN THE DISTRICTS WOULD CHANGE MT DB AT THE TIME AND NORTH COUNTY TRANSIT DISTRICT. ARE THERE PLANNING BASICALLY WAS TAKEN AWAY AND PUT UNDER. YOU KNOW THE THE REGIONAL ENTITY. AND IT'S AND I TOOK OVER. A LOT OF THE PLANNING SO AS FAR AS THE SERVICE IN THE PLANNING AND ALL THAT IT'S ALREADY REGIONAL. SO I'M WONDERING WHY YOU'RE BRINGING SOMEONE ON A BOARD THAT WE ALREADY HAVE THAT REGIONAL PLANNING. THAT WAS TAKEN AWAY FROM THE AND. SO YOU ARE CORRECT THERE FROM OF FROM A PLANNING PERSPECTIVE STANDOUT DOES DO. THAT WORK ABOUT FROM A SERVICEMAN OPERATIONS STANDPOINT A THAT IS IN CT. AND WHETHER YOU ARE A CONSTITUENT THAT LIVES NEAR THE WESTFIELD UTC MALL AND YOU'RE DEALING A WITH THE BUS IN THE BREEZE OF VEHICLES IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD OR IF YOU'RE DOWNTOWN RESIDENT YOU'RE DEALING WITH COASTER. A VEHICLES IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD EITHER WAY ITS OPERATIONAL CONCERNS WERE TALKING ABOUT AND THAT IS A PLACE FOR THE CITY'S INDIGO HAS CURRENTLY NO FORMAL VOICE. ON ADDITION IF I CAN JUST MAYBE ANTICIPATED FUTURE QUESTION OF YOU WE EIGHT YOU MAY BE ARGUING OR ONE COULD ARGUE FOR THE CONSOLIDATION OF THE METROPOLITAN TRANSIT SERVICE IN THE NORTH COUNTY TRANSIT DISTRICT. AND THAT IS NOT THE INTENT OF THIS BILL OBVIOUSLY WE COULD HAVE WRITTEN A BILL THAT DID THAT ON BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT IN TTT WANTS IN SO THAT'S NOT WHAT'S IN THIS BILL. BUT EVEN IF THAT'S A SUGGESTION YOU DON'T HAVE TO CONSOLIDATE OPERATIONS THAT WAS CONSIDERED AND REJECTED IN PART OUT OF RESPECT FOR THE INSIDIOUS ORGANIZATION. I MEAN IS THERE CONSIDERATION FOR HAVING A NORTH COUNTY ROTATING NONVOTING MEMBER ON MTS. MEAN IS THAT SO I'M AWARE OF A SIMILAR PHENOMENON FOR MTS. I I DON'T BELIEVE I BELIEVE IT THE CITIES THERE IT NOT COUNTY RELATED I GUESS THAT'S PROBABLY ONLY POWER WAY ON DOES HAVE A VOTING SEAT ON MTS IS BORED. AGAIN THIS BILL DOESN'T SPEAK TO THAT WE'RE TIME EX OFFICIO NOT A NON VOTING MEMBER. IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE BUT YOU KNOW I I'M NOT AWARE OF INTENSE BUSES THAT ARE OPERATING IN ESCONDIDO OR. TROLLEYS ARE RUNNING IN OCEANSIDE A THAT THAT ACROSS JURISDICTIONAL ISSUE DOESN'T OCCUR THAT IN THAT DIRECTION BUT IT DOES FROM IN TTT OPERATING ON CITY STREETS AND ON CITY RIGHT AWAY INSTEAD DATA. BECAUSE HOW IS NON IN NORTH COUNTY TRANSIT DISTRICT AREA SO I DON'T KNOW WHY I'M JUST. I'M SPEAKING REGIONALLY FROM I MEAN. I KNOW THAT WAS OUT OF EIGHT OF POWAY SOMETHING ACCOUNT IMMEDIATELY NOT SO MUCH TO YOU BUT. AGAIN I'M NOT AWARE OF OF MTS VEHICLES ARE OPERATIONS HAPPENING WITHIN IN CITIES A. AREA. BUT THEY CERTAINLY DO IN MTS IS AREA. WELL I'M I'M NOT CAN BE SUPPORTING THE BILL BUT I APPRECIATE YOUR RESPONSE. AND I JUST DON'T FEEL THAT THERE'S AN. URGENT NEED. FOR THIS SO THAT'S WHAT THIS MIGHT NOT. EXCUSE ME. AS SOMEONE WHO LIVES NEXT TO SANTA FE DEPOT. ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE THIS MAINTENANCE AND WE WENT FOR QUITE A FEW YEARS WHERE THAT MAINTENANCE WILL SUBMIT SLACK IS WHAT I UNDERSTAND I DID IVE THERE THE TIME. RECENTLY AND HAS IMPROVED SO ONE OF THE THINGS I MEAN WE ARE LOOKING THEN IS TO MAKING SURE THAT LIKE THE BUDGET IS MAINTAINED IN THAT MAINTENANCE IS MAINTAINED. BECAUSE THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL STATION AND IT IS CONSIDERED REGIONAL ASSET AND IF THE BOARD JOB AT THE LAST BOARD MEETING. THEY JUST PRESENTED TO THE BOARD MEMBERS THEIR EXPANSION PLANS AGAIN FOR. THE CONVENTION CENTER. EXTENSION SO THEY'RE VERY ACTIVELY PURSUING THEM AT THIS POINT IN TIME. AND I THINK IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR NCT DE TO HELP. GET THAT BY HAVING A SUPPORTER FROM THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO ON THAT. THANK YOU ARE THERE OTHER COMMENTS YES. SOME REMEMBER GRAYSON TAKE YOU MADAM CHAIR AND I. SOME REMEMBER GLORIA. AT THIS IS OUT OF MY DISTRICT I'M FROM THE BAY AREA BUT IF I MAY. I'M MY ATTEMPT IS NOT TO MARCH LIES YOUR BILL BY OVERSIMPLIFYING BUT IF I MAY JUST FOR MY OWN UNDERSTANDING FOR. THE ATTEMPT OF THIS BILL IS TO SIMPLY ADD AVOID A DIRECT VOICE FOR INPUT ONLY WITHOUT THE POWERS OF VOTING JUST SIMPLY SO THAT THE COMMUNICATION CAN BE A BIT MORE DIRECT. WITH A DEEPER RELATIONSHIP RATHER THAN GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS IS A BUREAUCRACY THAT GOVERNMENT CAN CREATE SOMETIMES. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT MR OKAY THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE. OKAY I HAVE A MOTION I NEED A SECOND. OKAY RIVER SECOND BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER COOLEY WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE SUSPECT WE ASK YOU AYE VOTE AND CHAIR.

LET'S SEE WE HAVE ITEM NUMBER SIX AB TWO SEVEN FIVE THREE ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN FOLLOWED BY. FREEING US FROM THEM FRIEDMAN AB TWO NINE ONE ONE SO WHAT YOU DO BACK TO BACK SAYS THAT SOUNDS PERFECT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR DEDICATED WORK ON THIS MEASURE ON THEIR HARD WORK THIS BILL RECEIVE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IN THE ASSEMBLY HOUSING COMMITTEE THIS MORNING. WEAVER DID DILIGENTLY WITH THE OPPOSITION AND REPORT TO WORKING WITH OTHERS WHO COME INTO SUPPORT AND OPPOSE THIS BILL BRINGS US DOWN THE ROAD TO A MAKING IT CLEARER. ABOUT HOW LOCALITIES PROCESS AND SEE BONUS APPLICATIONS IN A CONSISTENT TIMELY WAY. THE DENSITY BONUS APPLICATION PROCESS HAS BECOME IN MANY PLACES LONG THAT ARE JEWISH AND CAN LEAD TO PROJECT DELAYS AND ULTIMATELY CATALYZE A PROJECT'S DEMISE. AB TWENTY SEVEN FIFTY THREE GIVES ASSURANCES THE DEVELOPERS ON THE STATUS OF THEIR DENSITY BONUS APPLICATION BY REQUIRING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO REPORT BACK TO DEVELOPERS. A TIME THEIR APPLICATION IS INCOMPLETE THE INCENTIVES THAT THEY'RE ELIGIBLE FOR. A LOCAL AGENCY WILL INFORM THE DEVELOPER OF THEIR ELIGIBILITY FOR THE AMOUNT OF AFFORDABLE UNITS THE PARKING RATIO. INCENTIVES SESSIONS WAIVERS ARE REDUCTIONS IN DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS AND WHETHER THE APPLICANT IS PROVIDE ADEQUATE INFORMATION TO MAKE A DETERMINATION. SHOULD THE PROJECT DRASTICALLY CHANGE AB TWENTY SEVEN FIFTY THREE ALLOWS FLEXIBILITY FOR LOCALS TO ADJUST THE AMOUNT OF THE DENSITY BONUS PARKING RATIO IS WAY RISEN CONCESSIONS. DEEMED ELIGIBLE BASED ON THE CHANGES DURING THE COURSE OF THE DEVELOPMENT. THIS BUILDS ON ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOMS EXCELLENT BILL AB TWENTY FIVE OH ONE. REQUIRED LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO IDENTIFY A DENSITY BONUS APPLICANT IF THEIR APPLICATION IS COMPLETE WITHIN THIRTY DAYS. THIS BILL ALLOWS FOR CERTAINTY FOR THE DEVELOPER AND FLEXIBILITY FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT WHEN PROCESSING A DENSITY BONUS APPLICATION. THE BILL ALSO DECLARES A LEGISLATURE'S INTENT OF ESTABLISHING A UNIFORM PROCESS FOR THE REVIEW OF DENSITY BONUS APPLICATIONS INCLUDING THE RESEARCH REQUEST FOR INCENTIVES. YADA YADA I IS A MATTER OF STATEWIDE CONCERN AND APPLIES TO ALL CITIES INCLUDING CHARTER CITIES THE LEGISLATURE ETHICAL SIDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS A PRIORITY AND TWENTY SEVEN FIFTY THREE GIVE DEVELOPERS A CERTAINTY AND INSURANCE OF INCENTIVE TO DO SO. THIS BILL HAD NO REGISTERED OPPOSITION AS OF TODAY WE HAVE HEARD FROM ONE CITY. ABOUT WE WORK ARE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THEM I HAVE WITH ME TODAY MICHAEL CUSUMANO A LOCAL DEVELOPER IN BURBANK TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT AND TO TELL YOU WHY THIS BILL IS NECESSARY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS MICHAEL CUSUMANO. AS WE ALL KNOW OUR STATE IS IN A HOUSING CRISIS. AND WE ARE ESPECIALLY DEFICIENT THE AVAILABILITY OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING OUR STATE. IN RESPONSE TO THIS CRISIS YOU'VE BEEN ACTIVE LAWS SUCH AS THE DENSITY BONUS LIE THAT PROVIDE A PATHWAY TO THE DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY. TO CREATE MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AT NO ADDITIONAL PUBLIC COST. MANY CITIES HOWEVER ESPECIALLY THOSE CITIES THAT HAVE NOT MET THEIR HOUSING DEVELOPMENT OBLIGATIONS. FREQUENTLY DELAYED OR SIMPLY REFUSED TO PROCESS HOUSING PROJECTS. BECAUSE THEY DO NOT WANT YOU HOUSING BUILT THEIR CITY. AND THEY CERTAINLY DON'T WANT SACRAMENTO DICTATING TO THEM THAT THEY MUST ALLOW FOR DEVELOPMENT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. TAKE THE CITY OF BURBANK FOR EXAMPLE. THE CITY OF BURBANK IS AT OVER THIRTEEN THOUSAND NEW JOBS IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS. IN ONLY FIFTY FIVE HOUSING UNITS. THE RESULT IS AN ACUTE HOUSING CRISIS IN THAT CITY. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS CREATED LAW SPECIFICALLY TO ALLOW FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF HOUSING PROJECTS THAT INCLUDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IN COMMUNITIES LIKE BURBANK THAT FALL SHORT OF MEETING THEIR REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT ALLOCATIONS. BUT CURRENT LAW DOES NOT PROVIDE. DEFINED SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS OR TIME FRAMES FOR CITIES TO PROCESS THESE APPLICATIONS. AND IN REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT. THE EASIEST WAY TO STOP A PROJECT IS NOT TO DENY IT. BUT JUST TO DELAY IT UNTIL IT DIES ON ITS OWN. AB TWENTY SEVEN FIFTY THREE WILL PROVIDE SPECIFIC GUIDELINES AND REASONABLE TIME FRAMES FOR CITIES TO REVIEW DENSITY BONUS APPLICATIONS. NOTE THAT THIS BILL ONLY APPLIES TO PROJECTS SUBMITTED AS DENSITY BONUS APPLICATIONS. TO QUALIFY UNDER THE AFFORDABLE HIGH. HOUSING GUIDELINES. IT IS NOT APPLY TO LUXURY PROJECTS OFFICE BUILDING PROJECTS OR OTHER PROJECTS THAT DON'T HAVE A SIGNIFICANT COMPONENT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING WITHIN THEM. AND ALL OF THESE DENSITY BONUS APPLICATION PROJECTS ARE STILL SUBJECT TO FULL ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW UNDER SEEK WHAT. IF THE LEGISLATURE IS SERIOUS ABOUT HAVING A POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE HOUSING A BALANCED THAT'S EVIDENCE IN OUR STATE. IT MUST TAKE FURTHER ACTION TO PROVIDE A MEANS FOR THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO PLAY A ROLE IN CREATING A SOLUTION. AB TWENTY SEVEN FIFTY THREE IS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN THAT DIRECTION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OTHERS THAT ARE ARE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. JENNIFER SPECK ABOVE THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS IN SUPPORT.

IT'S BEEN INCREASING WILL CLEAR OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS THAT CALIFORNIA'S WHILE FILES FIRE SEASON IS NOW A YEAR ROUND BATTLE AND THAT OUR CURRENT POLICIES NEED TO BE REEVALUATED AND UPDATED. AB TWENTY NINE ELEVEN. TWENTY NINE ELEVEN IS AN EFFORT TO ENSURE THAT CITIES FOUND WITHIN HIGH FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY ZONES AND STATE RESPONSIBILITY AREAS HAVE THE TOOLS THEY NEED TO PREVENT AND REDUCE. THE THREAT OF WILDFIRE AB TWENTY NINE ELEVEN SEEKS TO PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FIRE SAFETY PLANNING EFFORTS AND LOCAL CITIES AND COUNTIES STRENGTHENED DEFENSIBLE SPACE REQUIREMENTS AND CLARIFY A VEGETATION CLEARANCE REQUIREMENT AROUND UTILITY LINES.

BUT COME IN YOU'LL BE PRESENTING A. B. NINETEEN NINETY NINE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN NINETY NINE WOULD EXPAND THE AUTHORITY OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. TO DEVELOPMENT PUBLIC BROADBAND SERVICES WHILE PRESERVING NET NEUTRALITY. TO ENSURE THE INTERNET REMAINS OPEN AND ACCESSIBLE TO ALL CALIFORNIANS. BROADBAND ACCESS IS OF VITAL IMPORTANCE TO THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AS WELL AS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE AN IMPORTANT PARTNER IN ENSURING THAT ITS BENEFITS ARE PAID AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE. CALIFORNIA LAW CURRENTLY AUTHORIZES MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICTS AND PUBLIC UTILITY DISTRICTS TO OPERATE THEIR OWN. A BROADBAND NETWORKS BUT OTHER FORMS OF INDEPENDENT LOCAL GOVERNMENT HEALTH LIMITED AUTHORITY TO DO SO. FOR EXAMPLE COMMUNITY SERVICE DIVERT A DISTRICT CST. CAN INITIALLY PROVIDE THE SERVICE BUT HAVE TO SEED OVER THE AUTHORITY ONCE A PRIVATE AND IF HE IS WILLING TO DEPLOY THE SERVICE. RESTRICTING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FROM BUILDING OUT THEIR OWN HIGH SPEED NETWORKS IS THERE ARE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE. A CLOSING CALIFORNIA'S DIGITAL DIVIDE. ESPECIALLY IN RURAL AREAS TO WORK ONLY THROUGH FORTY THREE PERCENT OF THE POPULATION HAS ACCESS TO BROADBAND IN THEIR HOUSEHOLDS. OR IN AREAS THAT ONLY HAVE ACCESS TO ONE PROVIDER WILL WOULD THERE'S A LACK OF ONGOING INVESTMENT. NOW THE IDEA THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS OUGHT TO PLAY A MORE ACTIVE ROLE IN BUILDING OUT LOCALLY OWNED BROADBAND NETWORKS HAS ALSO BEEN WRITTEN THOUGH BY. THE FACT THAT THEY EL FCC THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION A RECENTLY A TOOK ACTION TO REPEAL THE NET NEUTRALITY RUSE. ON THE FORMER NET NEUTRALITY ROUGE REQUIRED INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS TO OFFER EQUAL ACCESS TO ALL WEB CONTENT WITHOUT CHARGING CUSTOMERS FOR HIGHER QUALITY DELIVERY. WHAT GIVING PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT TO CERTAIN WEBSITES? ACCORDING TO A RECENT SURVEY CONDUCTED BY THE UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND MORE THAN EIGHTY PERCENT OF VOTERS OPPOSED THE FCC'S PLAN TO REPEAL ITS NET NEUTRALITY ROUGE. IT SHOULD BE THE STATE POLICY TO TO UPHOLD THE TENETS OF AN OPEN AT INTERNET BY REQUIRING ADHERENCE. THE CORE PRINCIPLES OF NET NEUTRALITY THIS BILL IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE WITH A FIRM CALIFORNIA'S COMMITMENT TO PROTECTING CONSUMERS. AND COMPETITION AFTER THE REPEAL OF NET NEUTRALITY WHILE AUTHORIZING THE EXPANSION OF PUBLIC BROADBAND SERVICES. WELL WITH THAT I A I LIKE TO TURN OVER TO MY WITNESSES RIGHT WELCOME. THANK YOU AJ ERIC YOUR CURRY ADVICE SHARE WALDRON. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME'S ERNESTO FALCONE AND THE LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL FOR THE ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION ARE ALSO KNOWN AS EFF. WHERE A CIVIL LIBERTIES LOOK ORGANIZATION THE CHAMPIONS OF FREE EXPRESSION PRIVACY AND INNOVATION THROUGH OUR LITIGATION PRACTICE? TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT AND. GRASSROOTS ACTIVISM. WE WERE WE WERE FOUND IN NINETEEN NINETY AND AND CURRENTLY FUNDED BY MORE THAN FORTY ONE THOUSAND DUES PAYING MEMBERS AND HAVE A FOLLOWING THAT WOULD MILLION. FOLLOWERS ON SOCIAL MEDIA. OUR MISSION IS TO ENSURE THAT THE RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS THAT WE ENJOY OUR ENHANCES OUR USE OF TECHNOLOGY GROWS. I WANT TO THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER SHALL FOR MOVIE FOR LEGISLATION THAT WILL PROMOTE THE ENTRY OF COMMUNITY BROADBAND IN CALIFORNIA WHILE HAVING THEM IN HERE TO NETWORK NEUTRALITY. I WANT TO SPEAK SPECIFICALLY TO THE CONSUMER BENEFITS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. ENGAGING INTO THE BROADBAND MARKET AND WHAT THAT WILL YIELD. IN SHORT IT WILL INJECT DESPERATELY NEEDED COMPETITION IN THE HIGH SPEED INTERNET MARKETPLACE. TODAY MORE THAN HALF OF AMERICANS HAVE ONE CHOICE WHEN IT COMES BROADBAND EXCEEDS TWENTY FIVE MEGABITS PER SECOND. YEAH FIFTY FIVE COMMUNITIES IN AMERICA ENJOY FIBER TO THE HOME SERVICES THAT EXCEED THAT SPEED BY A FACTOR OF FORTY. AND AND THOSE ARE ALL COMMUNITY BROADBAND PROJECTS. IN FACT THE WORLD'S FASTEST BROADBAND COMPANY IS IN CHATTANOOGA TENNESSEE AND IS RUN BY THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT. I HAD THE PLEASURE OF VISITING THAT FACILITY MYSELF EARLIER THIS YEAR AND IT'S TRULY REMARKABLE WHAT A LOCAL GOVERNMENT WAS ABLE TO DO. AYE AND TO LEARN THE HISTORY AS TO WHY THE THE ENGAGED IN THAT PROCESS ALTOGETHER. AND SOMETHING I LEARNED FROM THAT TRIP ARE FROM THE LEADERSHIP TEAM THEIR. PARTICULAR EXECUTIVE WHO WAS A FORMER EIGHTEEN T. EXECUTIVE WAS THAT CHATTANOOGA WAS CLASSIFIED FROM HER OLD COMPANY AS A TIER THREE CITY. WHAT WAS THAT I'VE NEVER HEARD OF THAT TIER THREE WOULD THAT MEAN? IT SIMPLY MEANT THAT IT WAS ONE OF THE CITIES THAT WAS NEVER LIKELY TO RECEIVE ANSWER PROPERTY INVESTMENT IN ORDER TO UPGRADE THEIR NETWORK. IN FACT TO CHATTANOOGA IF YOU THINK ABOUT THAT THE POPULATIONS OF POPULATION HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE OVER MEDIAN INCOME OF FORTY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS. DOZENS OF LOCAL TOWNSHIPS AND CITIES IN CALIFORNIA I SUSPECT ARE IN THE SAME TIER THREE STATUS AS CHATTANOOGA. THAT'S PROBABLY WHY WE HAVE THE HIGHEST PEOPLE A BIT THE LACK OF HIGH SPEED BROADBAND COMPETITION WE HAVE TODAY. MARKETS WERE COMMUNITY BROUGHT INTO FIGHTERS YOU'LL A SECOND CHOICE RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT PRICE COMPETITION FOR THE AVERAGE CONSUMER PAYS AROUND SEVENTY DOLLARS A MONTH FOR WORLD CLASS TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. SERVICE. FOR DECADES ARE TELECOM POLICIES A FOCUS ON WHAT'S CALLED FACILITIES BASED COMPETITION WERE NETWORKS COMPETE WITH OTHER NETWORKS. HOWEVER THE REALITY IS IS IT'S BEEN YEARS SINCE BOTH GOOGLE AND VERIZON WHICH ARE THE TWO MAJOR PLAYERS COMMITTING TO FIREBIRD FIBER TO THE HOME DEPLOYMENT. HAVE TERMINATED THEIR EXPANSIONS. AND EIGHTEEN YEARS NEVER FULLY COMMITTED TO A FIBRE HOME BUILT. THESE WERE THE MAJOR PLAYERS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE THE DIRECT COMPETITORS TO THE INCUMBENT CABLE. COMPANIES LIKE COMCAST AND CHARTER. WITHOUT THOSE MAJOR PLAYERS WHAT WE'RE LEFT WITH NOW ARE REGIONAL ACTORS SUCH AS SONIC IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WHICH IS GOING TO FIVE REBUILT. AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BUILDING EITHER PUBLIC NETWORKS OR ENGAGING IN SOME SORT OF PRIVATE PUBLIC PARTNERSHIP. SO I ASK THE COMMITTEE FOR AYE BILL FOR A BI NINETEEN NINETY NINE. OUGHT TO FURTHER INCENTIVIZE LOCAL COMPETITION BY LOCAL COMMUNITIES. IT'S TIME WE GIVE PEOPLE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE MATTERS IN THEIR OWN HANDS SO THAT YOU IF SHOULD THEY WISH TO PURSUE OCCUPIED OF ALTERNATIVE THANK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JACK TO SPEAK. EDU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS ANTHONY TANNER HOA THE CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION WERE IN FULL SUPPORT. JUST WANNA THANK THE AUTHOR IN A SNAP FROZE HARD WORK ON THIS. HOW SPECIAL DISTRICTS ARE? CURRENTLY. HAMPERED BY THE BY THE CURRENT LAW. WHERE IF ANY OTHER PRIVATE PROVIDER WANTS TO? GET EVEN EXPRESS IS A WILLINGNESS TO SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE. PROVIDE THIS IMPORTANT SERVICE. OUR OUR MEMBERS ARE HAMSTRUNG. LOTS OF THIS WOULD WOULD BROADEN THEIR THEIR ABILITY TO PROVIDE THESE IMPORTANT SERVICES. IT LOCALLY IN THEIR OWN COMMUNITY BOB WE THINK IT'S. PRETTY SIMPLE PRETTY OBVIOUS MEASURE AND WE THINK YOU. AND AS FOR SPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. SING NONE ARE THERE NO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE. SOME MINERAL WALDRON. A FEW. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. HIGH I DON'T KNOW THE TECHNICAL OF YOU SAYING TWENTY FIVE M.. P. S. YEAH I'VE GOT TWENTY FIVE MEGABITS PER SECOND THAT THE DOWNLOAD SPEED. YES WE WERE IN MY DISTRICT WHERE I LIVE IS A MATTER OF FACT AND THE WHOLE. MY I HAVE A HUGE SECTION PROBABLY EIGHTY PERCENT OF MY DISTRICT IS RURAL. MY SON TOOK IT TOOK HIM TWO DAYS TO TRY TO DOWNLOAD AND NO ONE ELSE COULD GET ON BECAUSE WE HAD ONE POINT FIVE M.. YES. NOW WE'VE TRIED UPGRADE TO THEY CLAIMED FIFTEEN BUT I DON'T THINK IT'LL BE. THAT HIGH. SO HOW DOES THAT AFFECT THE DISTRICT LIKE THAT LET'S VERY RURAL. ARM AND SO. SOME OF THE BIGGEST AYE AGNEW. THE BASE SUCCESS STORIES IN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ENGAGE IN THIS OUR RULE COMMUNITIES ARE BRISTOL VIRGINIA FOR EXAMPLE THE POPULATION OF SEVENTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE. THEY HAVE GIGABIT INTERNET SERVICE RIGHT THEY THEY HAVE SERVICE SAID THAT DWARFS I WILL WE HAVE BEEN IN MANY METROPOLITAN AREAS. IT'S IT'S PURELY A MATTER OF OF YOU POLITICAL WILL I WILL IN CAPABILITY OF OF YOUR HIRING EXPERTISE NECESSARY. AND IT DOES TAKE AN INVESTMENT AND LOCAL COMMUNITY AYE THERE ARE LOTS OF WILL COMMUNITIES OF IT INC FACE WHAT YOU WOULD YOU TALK A KIND OF FEELING DAY. BEING LEFT IN THE STONE AGE ALMOST AYE AND IN OR WILLING TO TAX THEMSELVES AND WILLING TO TO TAKE YOU TAKE MATTERS IN OUR OWN HANDS. SO I THINK THE REALITY IS OUTSIDE OF OF OF HEAVY SUBSIDIZATION SUBSIDIZATION FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND STATE GOVERNMENT. LOCAL GOVERNMENT ENGAGEMENT IN THE SPACES IS THE LIKELY RESULT A A THE LIKELY ONLY SALUTE AND FOR FOR THEM. ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS YES SELECTED. AMONG THE QUESTION OF CURIOSITY. YOUR YOUR EXAMPLES OF RURAL SUCCESS ARE OUT OF STATE GIVEN THE CALIFORNIA ONES. I KNOW I AND THAT MAY SPEAK TO THE THE SOLUTION THAT THE BILL IS AN ATTEMPT TO RESOLVE AYE IN THOSE. IN FOR LIKE PERSON FOR EXAMPLE THERE WASN'T ANY THIRD SITUATION WHERE. THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO SELL SELL THE THE PROJECT OR OR LEASE ACCESS TO A PRIVATE PARTY OR SEEK PERMISSION EARNED SHERMAN THERE A NEW PRIME PARTY WAS GOING TO TO ENGAGE IN THAT PLACE. THEY ALREADY KNEW THAT WAS THE SITUATION AND THEY GOT TO IT TO TO BUILD OUT DIRECTLY BUT I DON'T HAVE ANY. A SMALL RULE CALIFORNIA CITIES THAT BEING SAID THE. THERE'S NOTHING MAGICALLY DIFFERENT ABOUT BRISTOL VIRGINIA VERSES LIKE A CALIFORNIA ROLL CITY IN TERMS OF. DEPLOYMENT AND AND BUILDING UP THE INFRASTRUCTURE. IT IS REALLY ABOUT WHETHER IT WILL COMMUNITY WANTS IT TO TAKE MATTERS IN THEIR OWN HANDS AND ARE WILLING TO TO TAKE ADVANCEMENT. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. ALRIGHT I BELIEVE I HAVE A MOTION FROM SOME NO AND I'M WASHING IT. THE EMOTIONS THAT WERE BILL ASSEMBLYMEMBER COOLEY. A SECOND BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER GRAYSON. WHICH I TO CLOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. DID THE INTENT OF THE BILL IS NOT ESSENTIALLY TO ALLOW MORE FLEXIBILITY FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO ENGAGE IN THIS ACTIVITY. AND OUR AND OB. I THINK ONE EXAMPLE THAT I WANT TO CITED SAN FRANCISCO WHICH IS AN ACTUAL IN THE PROCESS OF BUILDING A. PUBLIC APART A PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP IN ORDER TO BUILD OUT THEIR OWN UP. BROADBAND NETWORK AND DIAL THE DOT PROJECT ALSO MANDATES THAT THEY COMPLY WITH THE NET NEUTRALITY RULES SO THAT'S ONE EXAMPLE THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT. DOT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE OF THAT GETTING ENGAGED IN THIS IN THIS PROCESS SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AS YOU KNOW ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHILD THIS IS NEAR AND DEAR TO MY HEART. FOR REAL BROADBAND AS MATTER OF FACT. MISTER LUCKY I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT OF CITY OF DAVIS WHICH IS NOT FAR FROM HERE IS LOOKING INTO THIS ALREADY AND THEY WOULD LIKE I'M SURE THEY'LL BE. VERY HAPPY WITH THIS BILL GETS THROUGH. I SUPPORT THIS BILLS OBJECTIVE TO PROVIDE ANOTHER OPTION FOR AND AND UNDERSERVED AREAS AND TO BRIDGE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. ALSO SUPPORT NET NEUTRALITY RULES FOR BOTH THE PRODUCT PRIVATE PROVIDERS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT PROVIDERS. AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD I ENCOURAGE YOU TO. TO. ENSURE THAT THE RULES OF FOR LOCAL AGENCIES ARE IN LINE WITH THE RULES OF PRIVATE ISPS AND THAT I WILL BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OKAY SECRETARY OF COLORADO MUNICH HAITIANS AND CONVEYANCE AGUIAR-CURRY. AGUIAR-CURRY I WALDRON. WALDRON AYE BLOOM. BLOOM AYE CABALLERO COOLEY. COOLEY AYE GRAYSON. GRAYSON AYE LACKEY. LACKEY KNOWS STONE HUPO. THE BILL'S UP FIVE TWO ONE THANK YOU VERY MUCH EVERY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ALRIGHT WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO IT LOOKS LIKE ITEM NUMBER FOUR AB TWENTY ONE EIGHTY FOUR MISTER ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU AS WELL AS ITEM NUMBER THIRTEEN A. B. THIRTY THIRTY SEVEN. FOR WELCOME. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR COLLEAGUES AB TWENTY ONE EIGHTY FOUR. WOULD ALLOW IMMIGRANTS TO START AND RUN BUSINESSES BY REQUIRING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT ISSUE. LICENCES TO BUSINESSES ARE TO ALLOW THEM TO ACCEPT A CALIFORNIA DRIVER'S LICENSE AND INDIVIDUAL TAX ID OR A MUNICIPAL ID. I KNOW EVERYONE IN OUR LEGISLATURE KNOWS HOW MUCH THE ECONOMIC SUCCESS OUR STATE IS DEPENDENT ON AND HAS BEEN THE RESULT OF OUR. IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES WHO CONTRIBUTE THIRTY TWO PERCENT OF OUR STATE'S GDP. ARE WHO MAKE UP ONE OUT OF THREE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS AND FORTY FIVE PERCENT OF ALL NEW BUSINESS FOUNDERS. UNFORTUNATELY ABOUT HALF OF THE CITIES IN OUR STATE REQUIRE AN APPLICANT FOR A LOCAL BUSINESS LICENSE. TO PROVIDE A SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER THIS IS BEN A SIGNIFICANT BARRIER TO MANY CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE SEEKING OPPORTUNITY. TO BUSINESS OWNERSHIP. THIS BILL WOULD BENEFIT BUSINESS OWNERS SOLE PROPRIETORS INCLUDING. CAFES AND SMALL RETAIL OWNERS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS IN THOSE IN PROFESSIONAL SERVICES. THIS BILL BUILT ON PREVIOUS STATE LAWS THAT ALLOW APPLICANTS FOR PROFESSIONAL LICENSES TO PROVIDE A FEDERAL ID NUMBER. THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH FEDERAL LAW WHICH AUTHORIZES STATES TO MAKE PROFESSIONAL AND COMMERCIAL LICENSES AVAILABLE TO IMMIGRANTS REGARDLESS OF STATUS. ALSO JUST NOTE THE BILL PROTECTS THE NUMBERS COLLECTED BY A LOCAL GOVERNMENT FROM DISCLOSURE EXCEPT AS REQUIRED TO ADMINISTER THE PROGRAM OR TO COMPLY. WITH STATE LAW OR A FEDERAL COURT ORDER AND SO WITH THAT LIKE TURN IT OVER TO OUR SPONSORS. WELCOME. THANK YOU AND CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS MICHELLE JACOB AND I'M AND STAFF ATTORNEY AT LAWYERS COMMITTEE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS OF THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA. WHICH IS A CO SPONSOR OF AB TWENTY ONE EIGHTY FOUR. THE LAWYERS COMMITTEE IS COMMITTED TO ENSURING CIVIL RIGHTS IN THE ECONOMY. PARTICULARLY AS IT RELATES TO EXPANDING ACCESS ENTREPRENEURSHIP. THE NEED FOR THIS BILL AROSE FROM OUR WORK WITH IMMIGRANT BUSINESS OWNER CLIENTS. AND FROM PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS THE STATE INCLUDING THE CENTRAL VALLEY. WHERE WE LEARNED THAT MANY LOCALITIES REQUIRE SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS ON LOCAL BUSINESS LICENSE APPLICATIONS? IMMIGRANTS BRING INNOVATION AND CULTURAL DIVERSITY TO OUR ECONOMY THROUGH LOCAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP. HOWEVER THE CURRENT RIGHT LOCAL REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT CREATES A CONFUSING INCONSISTENT PATCHWORK FOR IMMIGRANT BUSINESS OWNERS. AB TWENTY ONE EIGHTY FOUR WILL GO A LONG WAY TO REMOVING SYSTEMIC BARRIERS FOR HIM AGAIN CALIFORNIANS. WILL LAY THE GROUNDWORK FOR LONG TERM ECONOMIC INCLUSION AND WILL CONTRIBUTE TO OUR STATES CONTINUED ECONOMIC RECOVERY THANK YOU. THANK YOU WELCOME THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR A COMMITTEE MEMBERS JEANETTE THIS OF I'M THE GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS MANAGER FOR THE CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT POLICY CENTER. AYE WE'RE PROUD TO GO SPONSOR THESE EFFORTS TO REMOVE BARRIERS TO BUSINESS OWNERSHIP FOR IMMIGRANTS OF THIS BILL REFLECTS CALIFORNIA'S OPPORTUNITY TO ADVANCE POLICIES THAT ARE INCLUSIVE ARE IMMIGRANT WORKFORCE AND REFLECT THE STRONG ENTREPRENEURIAL SPIRIT. OF IMMIGRANT FAMILIES IT'S CONSISTENT WITH LOCAL AND STATE LAWS THAT FULLY INTEGRATE IMMIGRANTS INTO OUR ECONOMY AND OUR PUBLIC LIFE WHILE ALSO SUPPORTING REGULATORY COMPLIANCE. IT'S ALSO CONSISTENT WITH EFFORTS TO PROTECT THE PRIVACY OF OUR RESIDENTS IN MAKING SURE THAT WE CONTINUE. TO SUPPORT RESIDENTS AGAINST EFFORTS TO PROTECT THAT TO. BREAK UP FAMILIES EXCUSE ME AND DEPORT CALIFORNIANS WORK CRITICAL PART OF OUR SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC FABRIC WE THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU FOR HIS CONTINUED LEADERSHIP AND HEARD YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS EFFORT WHICH JUSTICE.

GREAT SUBSTRATE FIRST TIME GONNA START BY. BY ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS LISTED IN THE ANNOUNCES. ONE APPRECIATE THE WORK OF THE CHAIR ARE AND YOUR STAFF ON THIS TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES. RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION. AS WELL AS TO ENSURE AS I KNOW THE CHAIR. WOULD WANNA MAKE SURE THAT OF THIS BILL IS ACCESSIBLE TO ALL PARTS OF THE STATE. WE ALL KNOW THAT CALIFORNIANS IN THE MIDST OF THE WORST HOUSING CRISIS IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY. THIS BILL WOULD HELP TO RECREATE REDEVELOPMENT AS A TOOL TO FUND INFRASTRUCTURE IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING. ON A SMALLER SCALE AND WITH SIGNIFICANT STATE OVERSIGHT COMPARED TO FORMER REDEVELOPMENT. AFTER PROP THIRTEEN FORMER REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES WERE A FUNDAMENTAL FUNDING TOOL FOR INFRASTRUCTURE HOUSING. A AT THE TIME OF THEIR LIMITATION RDAS REQUIRED TO SPEND A BILLION DOLLARS TO FUND AFFORDABLE HOUSING STATEWIDE EVERY YEAR. THIS BILL WLL ALLOW THE CITY TOOK RECREATE REDEVELOPMENT INFRASTRUCTURE AND HOUSING AGENCIES WITH THIRTY PERCENT OF THE MONIES. GENERATED IN THE PROJECT AREA TO GO TO FIND HUNT DOT TO TO FIND HOUSING. WHILE ALL TAXING ENTITIES THAT RECEIVE PROPERTY TAXES CITIES COUNTIES AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS ARE REQUIRED UNDER A CONSTITUTION TO PARTICIPATE. THE BILL WOULD MAKE THE COUNTY AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS HOLE THROUGH PASS THROUGH PAYMENTS. WHILE THE STATE WOULD BACK FILL FUNDS DIVERTED THROUGH SCHOOLS UNDER PROP NINETY EIGHT OBLIGATIONS. A NEW AGENCY. WOULD BE ABLE TO APPLY TO THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL FOR REVIEW OF WHETHER IT'S ACTIVITY SUPPORT STATE GOALS. ARE THE SGC WOULD MAKE A RECOMMENDATION TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WHO WOULD DETERMINE THE FINAL APPROVAL. AND SPECIFICALLY WHETHER. THE EXPENDITURES OF A NEW DISTRICT ARE IS UNDER A CAP ON HOW MUCH THE STATE COULD CONTRIBUTE EVERY YEAR TO ENSURE SOME PATROLS ON THE SIZE OF NEW REDEVELOPMENT. TO AVOID THE AGREE JUST ABUSES OF SOME FORMER REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES THIS BILL ALSO INCLUDES A NUMBER OF SAFEGUARDS. INCLUDING ROBUST ANTI DISPLACEMENT POLICIES RECORD KEEPING REQUIREMENTS INDEPENDENT ANNUAL AUDITS AND HARSH FINANCIAL PENALTIES. WANT TO THANK OF THE WORKING GROUP THAT REFLECTED A LOT OF THE DIVERSITY OF OUR LEGISLATURE OF WHO ARE THE JOINT AUTHORS OF THIS BILL. AND DATA FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE WE WORK HARD TO BRING A COMMON SENSE APPROACH TO REESTABLISH REDEVELOPMENT. OF BUT DO IT IN A WAY THAT IS RESPONSIBLE AND A MORE LIMITED SKILL FOCUSED ON OUR STATES PRIORITIES AT THIS TIME. A WITH THAT LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO. MY JOINT AUTHORS MR BLUE. THANK YOU FELLOW COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I'M HONORED TO BE. I JOIN AUTHOR OF THIS BILL THANK MISTER CHIU SEARLE ALLOWING. ME TO BE IN THAT POSITION I CANNOT STRESS HOW IMPORTANT THIS BILL IS TO HELPING US REBUILD OUR AFFORDABLE HOUSING STOCK. THE LOSS OF REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES HAS DIRECTLY CONTRIBUTED. TO OUR AFFORDABLE HOUSING SHORTAGE AND THE GROWING HOMELESSNESS CRISIS IN OUR CITIES THAT. TRULY GROWS WORSE EVERYDAY. LIKE YOU I SERVED IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND SAW THE IMPACT THAT REDEVELOPMENT DOLLARS HAD ON MY COMMUNITY AND OTHER CITIES WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME TALKING ABOUT PUSHING CITIES TO BUILD HOUSING. AND ESPECIALLY AFFORDABLE HOUSING AFFORDABLE HOUSING SIMPLY CAN'T BILL BE BUILT WITHOUT GOVERNMENT'S HELP AT THE SAME TIME IF THE CITY'S MOTIVATED TO BUILD THAT HOUSING. THEY CAN'T DO IT IF THEY DON'T HAVE THE FUNDING AB THREE OH THREE SEVEN WILL RESTORE SOME OF THOSE FUNDS. AND HELP LOCAL SPILLED THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT WE ALL NEED. AND AVOID THE PITFALLS OF THE FORMER REDEVELOPMENT PROGRAM. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK HER ABOUT. OF OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.

SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF BOB NAY OR AND REPRESENTING FEEL STAT AND COMPANY AS WELL HE COULDN'T BE HERE WITH US TODAY. MEMBERS THE VOTER APPROVAL REQUIREMENT IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE BIGGEST ISSUES THAT WE HAVE WITH REDEVELOPMENT AS IS NOT A SURPRISE. EITHER TO THE AUTHOR OR REGARDING ANY OF THE BILLS. PERTAINING TO REDEVELOPMENT THAT HAVE COME UP BAD BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE AS WELL AS HOUSING COMMITTEE THIS YEAR. THE BUSINESS MODEL OF REDEVELOPMENT PART FRANKLY IS TO FLOAT BONDS AGAINST FUTURE PROPERTY TAX REVENUE AND USE THAT MONEY TO BUY A PROPERTY USUALLY THROUGH EMINENT DOMAIN. WE'VE ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT BOTH TESTS AS WELL AS TACK IT'S TAX INCREMENT FINANCE IN GENERAL SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO VOTER APPROVAL. YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT POTENTIALLY TAKING TAX REVENUE FROM OTHER LOCAL COMMUNITIES. THAT IS GENERAL FUND DOLLARS THOSE ARE TAXPAYER DOLLARS ON THE LOCAL LEVEL AND. YOU KNOW HOW. BUT BEFORE YOU ISSUE BONDS THE COULD LAST YOU KNOW ANYWHERE FROM THIRTY TO FORTY FIVE YEARS IS PARDON AND AN IMPERATIVE WE WOULD ARGUE CELL WITHOUT THAT BEING IN THE BASQUE FOR AND ABOUT. OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS TERRY BURDEN ON BEHALF OF S. HERE YOU CALIFORNIA LET ME START BY SAYING I APPRECIATE. THE AUTHORS. AMENDMENTS AND THE DIRECTION THIS BILL IS HEADED WE. WERE OPPOSED TO THE ORIGINAL VERSION THE BILL. WE THINK IT'S MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. PRINCIPALLY A COUPLE OF CONCERNS WE HAVE IS IS ENSURING THAT THE LOCAL AGENCIES. WHO AREN'T NECESSARILY PART OF THE PLANNING PROCESS OR RECIPIENTS OF THE BENEFIT OF THIS BILL ARE HELD HARMLESS? AND ALSO WOULD LIKE TO SEE A MUCH LARGER. REQUIREMENT ON LOW AND MODERATE INCOME HOUSING. TO AVOID SOME OF THE PRIOR SITUATIONS WE GOT IN WITH REDEVELOPMENT. SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHORS TO SPILL MY FOUR THINK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ANTHONY TANNER HELL CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION.

FOR SAID THIS BILL SO THE INTENT OF A BILL WAS TO. MAKE SURE THE SPECIAL TO SIX OR HAVE HOPE ARE HELD HOLD. AND THE I WANT TO JUST TAKE THIS MOMENT TO CLARIFY I SAID AT THE BEGINNING THAT I'M ACCEPTING THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. ARE WHICH ADDRESS A LOT OF THE ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED BY FOLKS WHO WERE OPPOSED UNLESS AMENDED AND SPECIFICALLY UP WHAT WE ARE DOING ANY AMENDMENTS THE INITIAL.

SO RUDE TO REQUIRE SGC TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO ANY CITY OR COUNTY THAT WANTS TO SEPARATE. RIA AND TO SEACM AND TO REQUIRE SGC TO APPROVE PROJECTS THAT EQUITABLY REPRESENT RURAL. SUBURBAN AND URBAN COMMUNITIES AS WELL AS ENSURE EQUITABLE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION I WANTED SURE THAT THE SMALLER COMMUNITIES WHO LONG. WHO LONGER HAVE COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT STAFF WHO NO LONGER HAVE COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT STAFF WILL BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF CREATING RIA? IF THEY CHOOSE TO DO SO MANY OF OUR STAFF IN SMALL COMMUNITIES ARE GONE AND SO IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT TO KINDA GET. UP TO SPEED AND SO I APPRECIATE YOU LISTENING TO US ON THAT AND I'LL BE OF SUPPORTING A BILL TODAY. THANK YOU. SECRETARY CALDERON. THE MOTION AS DO PASS AS AMENDED AND RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS ACT WE ARE CURRY AYE AGUIAR-CURRY AYE WALDRON. WALDRON NO BLOOM AYE BLOOM AYE CABALLERO COOLEY. COOLEY AYE GRAYSON. GRAYSON AYE LACKEY. LACKEY NO STONE VOEPEL. THE BILL NEEDS ONE VOTE AND WE HAVE MANY MISSING AS YOU CAN TELL THANK YOU COLLEAGUES THANK YOU. OKAY LET'S MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER EIGHT AB TWENTY EIGHT EIGHTY ASSEMBLY MEMBER HARPER. WELCOME MR HARPER. WELL THANK YOU WELL MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS ARE TODAY I'M HERE TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY EIGHT EIGHTY. THIS BIPARTISAN MEASURE WILL AUTHORIZE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THE CONTRACT WITH THE FAIR POLITICAL PRACTICES COMMISSION. COMMONLY REFERRED TO THE YET IT HAS THE YET PPC. FOR ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF LOCAL CAMPAIGN FINANCE AND GOVERNMENT ETHICS LAWS THE EPIC BE SEE AND FORCE THE POLITICAL REFORM ACT IN IS THE MAIN LAW THE GOVERNOR'S THAT STATE ELECTION CAMPAIGNS AND GOVERNMENT ETHICS. THE MAY IMPOSE ADMINISTRATIVE FINES AGAINST THOSE WHO VIOLATE THE ACT LAST YEAR THE COMMISSION COLLECTED MORE THAN ONE POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN FINES. FOR ELECTED OFFICIALS LOBBYIST POLITICAL DONORS AND OTHERS IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN. EVEN THOUGH THE POLITICAL REFORM ACT ALLOWS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO ADOPT THEIR OWN ORDINANCES TO GOVERN CAMPAIGNS FOR LOCAL POLITICAL OFFICE. THE F. SEE CURRENTLY HAS NO AUTHORITY OVER THOSE ELECTIONS INSTEAD AND FORSMAN OF THESE ORDINANCES TYPICALLY LEFT TO THE CITY ATTORNEY OR. THE COUNTY DID. COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY SINCE MOST LOCAL GOVERNMENTS LACK THE EXPERIENCE IN INVESTIGATING OR PROSECUTING CAMPAIGN VIOLATIONS THERE IS LITTLE TO NO ENFORCEMENT SOMETIMES THE QUESTION IS MOTIVATION. IN RECENT YEARS THE LEGISLATURE HAS PASSED FOR BILLS EXTENDING AUTHORIZATION A IN A FEW CASES TWO DIFFERENT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THE CONTRACT WITH THE I. PPC. FOR ENFORCEMENT OF THEIR CAMPAIGN FINANCE ORDINANCES EACH BILL HAS RECEIVED NEAR UNANIMOUS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. THIS BILL GIVES GOVERNMENTS THE ABILITY TO BRING A COST EFFECTIVE EXPERIENCED INDEPENDENT AND IMPARTIAL ENTITY TO INVESTIGATE CAMPAIGN FIND FINANCES. WERE GOVERNMENT ETHICS VIOLATIONS AND BRING ACTION AGAINST THESE VIOLATORS IN HIS COURSE COMPLETELY VOLUNTARY FOR THOSE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THAT COME TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WITH ME HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY EIGHT EIGHTY IS JACK WAGNER FROM COMMON CAUSE. WELCOME JACK ó GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS AND MY NAME IS JACK WAGNER. OF COMMON CAUSES PROUD SPONSOR OF AB TWENTY EIGHT EIGHTY WHICH PROVIDE PROVIDE AN EFFECTIVE ENFORCEMENT OPTION FOR LOCAL CAMPAIGN FINANCE AND ETHICS ORDINANCES AT NO COST THE STATE. UNDER CURRENT LAW THERE NO CAMPAIGN FINANCE REGULATIONS OTHER THAN DISCLOSURES THAT APPLY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. HOWEVER LOCAL GOVERNMENTS DO HAVE THE POWER TO ENACT THEIR OWN CAMPAIGN FINANCE ORDINANCES. MANY DO SO AS MORE THAN A HUNDRED LOCAL JURISDICTIONS HAVE ADOPTED THEIR OWN LOCAL CAMPAIGN FINANCE ORDINANCES WHICH CALIFORNIA COMMON CAUSE APPLAUDS. OF THESE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS MANY OF THE LARGEST SUCH AS ORANGE COUNTY IN THE CITIES OF LOS ANGELES IN OAKLAND. HAVE CREATED ETHICS COMMISSIONS TO EFFECTIVELY ENFORCE THEIR ORDINANCES. MOST JURISDICTIONS HOWEVER CANNOT AFFORD TO FUND AND STAFF THEIR OWN ETHICS CAN. FOR THE SMALL AND MID SIZE CITIES AND COUNTIES LOCAL CAMPAIGN ORDINANCE ENFORCEMENT FALLS TO THE CITY ATTORNEY OR DISTRICT ATTORNEY RESPECTIVELY. AS A RESULT LOCAL ENFORCEMENT TENDS TO BE RARE AS ASSEMBLYMAN HARPER MENTIONED. CITY ATTORNEY'S INDIA IS DO NOT TYPICALLY HAVE MUCH EXPERTISE ENFORCING CAMPAIGN FINANCE LAWS AND THEY HAVE OTHER PRIORITIES COMPETING FOR THEIR ATTENTION. FOR EXAMPLE A CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION LIMIT VIOLATION IS UNLIKELY TO MERIT DE A RESOURCES FOR PROSECUTION WHEN COMPARED TO A VIOLENT CRIME. ADDITIONALLY THERE IS ALSO A RISK OF APPARENT POLITICAL BIAS IF AN APPOINTED CITY ATTORNEY BRINGS A SUIT AGAINST A NON INCUMBENT OR IF ELECTED DISTRICT ATTORNEY BRINGS CHARGES AGAINST A POLITICAL RIVAL. AB TWENTY EIGHT EIGHTY ALLOWS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO ADOPT A BETTER MODEL FOR LOCAL CAMPAIGN ORDINANCE ENFORCEMENT. BECAUSE THE I PP C. SPECIALIZES IN CAMPAIGN ENFORCEMENT AND USES AN ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS AB PPC ENFORCEMENT PROVIDE STREAMLINED AND EFFICIENT EDUCATION ENFORCEMENT AT A FRACTION OF THE COST OF SETTING UP AN INDEPENDENT ETHICS CAN. MOREOVER THEFT PPC IS RESPECTED AS AN IMPARTIAL BODY MAKING ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS LESS CONTROVERSIAL MOVE THE BILL. IN CONCLUSION AB TWENTY EIGHT EIGHTY PROVIDES AN IMPORTANT FORCE AN OPTION TO MAKE LOCAL CAMPAIGN FINANCE AND ETHICS ORDINANCES MORE EASILY AND EFFECTIVELY ENFORCEABLE. CALIFORNIA COMMON CAUSE IS PROUD TO SUPPORT THIS BILL AND WE STRONGLY URGE AND I BOTH THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THE OTHERS IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN RETAIN HUTCHINGS ITALY CALIFORNIA CITIES ALLY MY COMMENTS WITH CALIFORNIA COMMON CAUSE. WE DO BELIEVE THAT THERE IS SOME SOMEWHAT OF AN INHERENT. CONFLICT OF INTEREST IN YOU DO HAVE A D. A. THAT. ALSO ACTS AS THE POLITICAL ENFORCEMENT OFFICER WE THINK THIS IS A. STRAIGHTFORWARD MEASURE THAT ALLOWS.

I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE IN OUR FAVOR THIS MEASURE THAT THAT HELPS A BRING FORWARD I'VE GOOD ENFORCEMENT PRACTICES SAID THAT ARE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ALL SUPPORTING YOUR BILL TODAY THANK YOU OKAY US SECRETARY TAKE THE ROLE IN A MOTION IS TO PASS AND WE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS ACT WE ARE CURRY AYE AGUIAR-CURRY AYE WALDRON. WALDRON AYE BLOOM AYE BLOOM AYE CABALLERO COOLEY COOLEY AYE GRAYSON. LACKEY I'VE LACKEY AYE STONE PHOTO. BILLS UP FIVE ZERO GRADUATIONS LET'S MOVE ON TO SOMEWHERE DAILY. A ITEM NUMBER FOURTEEN A. B. THREE ZERO SIX EIGHT. KARMA. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. THIS BILL HAS TO DO WITH. THE ABILITY OF COUNTY AUDITOR'S. TO HIRE ATTORNEYS TO HIRE THEIR OWN LEGAL COUNSEL. COUNTY AUDITOR CONTROLLERS PLAY A VITAL ROLE IN PROTECTING TAXPAYERS. IN EVALUATING THE FINANCIAL DECISIONS AND SPENDING WITHIN THEIR COUNTIES. UNFORTUNATELY SOME MONITOR CONTROLLERS HAVE FACED RETALIATION AND INTIMIDATION FROM COUNTY OFFICIALS AFTER THEY QUESTIONED THE LEGALITY OF CERTAIN PAYMENTS. THIS BILL PROVIDES AUDITOR CONTROLLER IS THE ABILITY TO SEEK OUTSIDE COUNSEL. WHEN A CONFLICT OF OPINION AND OR CONFLICT OF INTEREST BETWEEN THE AUDITOR CONTROLLER AND COUNTY COUNCIL ARISES. IN ADDITION THIS BILL ESTABLISHES NECESSARY SAFEGUARDS TO SUPPORT AUDITOR CONTROLLERS AS THEY PROVIDE OBJECTIVE OVERSIGHT OF THE FINANCIAL DECISIONS WITHIN THEIR COUNTIES. FREE FROM FEAR AND INTIMIDATION. WITH ME TODAY AS THE BILL'S SPONSOR ORANGE COUNTY'S ELECTED AUDITOR CONTROLLER MISTER ERIC WOOLERY. AGAIN THE SPONSOR OF THE BILL WELCOME. MADAM CHAIR MADAM VICE CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS ERIC WOOLERY AND I AM A SPONSOR OF AB THREE ZERO SIX SAY. HAS THE INDEPENDENTLY ELECTED AUDITOR CONTROLLER OF ORANGE COUNTY. MY OFFICE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR EVALUATING ALL CLAIMS AND CHARGES SUBMITTED TO THE COUNTY AND FOR ISSUING ALL COUNTY PAYMENTS. IN THIS ROLE I HAVE FOUND INCIDENTS WERE HAVING ACCESS TO OUTSIDE COUNSEL WOULD HAVE EITHER SERVED AS A DETRIMENT. A DETERRENT. TO QUESTIONABLE ACTIONS OR ALLOW ME TO BETTER CHALLENGE QUESTIONABLE ACTIONS. FOR INSTANCE MY OFFICE DELAYED PAYMENT UP ON HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN TAXPAYER FUNDED MAILERS. THAT TO MEMBERS OF THE ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS WANTED TO SEND TO VOTER SHORTLY BEFORE THE TWENTY SIXTEEN ELECTIONS. I WANTED CLEARANCE FROM THE APP PPC BUT WAS INSTEAD COERCED BY THE COUNTY COUNCIL TO MAKE THE MAKE PAYMENT ON THESE PRE ELECTION MAILERS. THESE MAILERS WERE SO EGREGIOUS THAT THE LEGISLATURE UNANIMOUSLY PASSED S. B. FORTY FIVE WHICH THE GOVERNOR SIGNED INTO LAW LAST YEAR. TO SEVERELY RESTRICT THESE MAILERS. AND ANOTHER INCIDENTS MY OFFICE ATTEMPTED TO WITHHOLD A FOUR YEAR RETROACTIVE PENSION PAYMENT FOR A THIRD MEMBER OF THE ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. WHILE WE SOUGHT INFORMATION ON THE LEGALITY OF THIS PAYMENT. WHEN THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY INVESTIGATORS CAME TO MY OFFICE TO DEMAND THAT MY STAFF MAKE THE PENSION PAYMENT WHILE I WAS OUT FOR A SCHEDULED MEDICAL PROCEDURE. THE COUNTY COUNCIL REFUSED TO OFFER ANY ADVICE TO MY EMPLOYEES. AB THREE ZERO SIX EIGHT FIXES A CATCH TWENTY TWO FOR COUNTY AUDITOR CONTROLLERS THAT RESULTS IN A GAP IN STATE LAW. THE GOVERNMENT CODE SPECIFICALLY SAYS THAT COUNTY COUNCIL IS THE LEGAL ADVISER TO THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. BUT THE GOVERNMENT CODE DOES NOT ALLOW ME TO HIRE OUTSIDE COUNSEL WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. UNDER CURRENT LAW THE COUNTY ASSESSOR AND THE COUNTY SHERIFF HAVE A REMEDY FOR THIS PROBLEM. THAT IS NOT AVAILABLE TO MY OFFICE AB THREE ZERO SIX EIGHT WOULD ALLOW ME ACCESS TO THE SAME PROCESS THAT IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TO THE ASSESSOR AND SHARE OF. SPECIFICALLY THIS BILL ALLOWS THE COUNTY AUDITOR CONTROLLERS TO GO TO COURT. TO OBTAIN OUTSIDE COUNSEL WHEN EIGHT WE BELIEVE THERE IS A CONFLICT OF INTEREST WITH COUNTY COUNCIL. ADDITIONALLY AB THREE ZERO SIX EIGHT IMPROVES THE EXISTING PROCESS BY HAVING THE PRESIDING JUDGE SELECT SPECIFIC COUNCIL. RATHER THAN THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS SELECTING THE COUNCIL. WHEN THE PRESIDING JUDGE RULES THERE IS A CONFLICT OF INTEREST. THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTY AUDITOR'S IS A CO SPONSOR OF THIS BILL. THE ASSOCIATION OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT AUDITOR'S. THE AUDITOR CONTROLLERS OF FORTY SIX COUNTIES AND SEVERAL SHERIFF'S SUPPORT AB SIX ZERO OR THREE ZERO SIX EIGHT. COAUTHORS OF AB THREE ZERO SIX EIGHT INCLUDE MEMBERS OF BOTH PARTIES AND BOTH LEGISLATIVE HOUSES. I HOPE WE WILL BE ABLE TO USE AB THREE ZERO SIX SAY TO TRY TO ALLEVIATE THE CATCH TWENTY TWO AND STATE LAW. AT FOUR OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN LINGLE LEGAL COUNSEL. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR IN AYE VOTE ON THIS BIPARTISAN GOOD GOVERNMENTS. PROGRAM AB THREE ZERO SIX A. THANK YOU ARE THERE OTHER PEOPLE. PART OF THE BILL. WHAT'S. YES. I'M. ROBERTS. DARK. AND.

ALRIGHT LET'S GO ON WITH ITEM NUMBER FIVE AB TWO SIX EIGHT ONE ASSEMBLY MEMBER NAZARIAN WELCOME. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY SIX EIGHTY ONE WOULD REQUIRE BUILDING DEPARTMENTS AND LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO CREATE AN INVENTORY OF POTENTIALLY SEISMICALLY VULNERABLE. BUILDINGS WITHIN THEIR JURISDICTION AND SUBMITTED TO THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES TO CREATE A STATEWIDE INVENTORY. OUR STATE HAS THOUSANDS OF BUILDINGS THAT ARE KNOWN TO PRESENT A HEIGHTENED EARTHQUAKE RISK OF DEATH INJURY AND DAMAGE. BASED ON THEIR AGE STRUCTURAL SYSTEM SIZE AND LOCATION THE MOST RECENT CALIFORNIA SHAKEOUT STUDY ESTIMATES THAT A MAJOR QUAKE ALONG THE. SAN ANDREAS FAULT COULD CAUSE MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED BILLION AND PHYSICAL AND ECONOMIC DAMAGE. AND EIGHTEEN HUNDRED OR MORE DEATHS. THE CHRONIC LABOR AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING SHORTAGES OF. MOST OF CALIFORNIAN CITIES ALREADY SUFFER WOULD TO DRAMATICALLY INCREASE FOR YEARS TO COME FOLLOWING A MAJOR SEISMIC EVENT. WHILE SOME CITIES MOST NOTABLY LA AND SAN FRANCISCO HAVE IDENTIFIED VULNERABLE BUILDINGS AND SANTA MONICA AS WELL. IDENTIFIED VULNERABLE BUILDINGS AND IMPLEMENTED MANDATORY RETROFITS LARGE PARTS OF THE STATE HAVE NOT. AND ACCURATE STATEWIDE BUILDING. BALL A VULNERABILITY MAPPED. IS AN ESSENTIAL FIRST STEP IN DEVELOPING LONGER TERM SOLUTIONS TO MITIGATE THE EFFECTS. OF A MAJOR EARTHQUAKE I'M COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS. OF THIS BILL AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD AND. I THINK I'VE ALREADY ALSO CONVEYED THAT IN ONE ON ONE MEETINGS WITH SOME OF THE MEMBERS AS WELL. I'M JOINED BY. EVAN REESE ON BEHALF OF THE SAME IT SEISMIC RESILIENCY INITIATIVE AS WELL AS ALICIA WILKINS WITH THE FAIR HOUSING COUNCIL OF RIVERSIDE. COUNTY BOARD MEMBER. WELCOME TO. HELLO I AM I AM THAT MY NAME IS SEVEN RECENT I'M EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE U. S. RESILIENCY COUNCIL. I LAST MONDAY THE WASHINGTON POST'S KNOW THAT THERE'S TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CARS STILL ON THE ROAD WITH EXPLOSIVE AIRBAGS. I IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE TENS OR EVEN HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF OLDER VULNERABLE BUILDINGS THAT ARE STILL ON THE ROAD. WE CAN'T RECALL. CAR. BUT AB TWENTY SIX EIGHTY ONE PROVIDES CRITICAL INFORMATION TO LOCAL COMMITTEES ARE AMONG THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES ABOUT THEIR EARTHQUAKE RISKS. SO THAT THEY CAN MAKE BETTER INFORMED DECISIONS ABOUT THE BUILDINGS IN WHICH THERE RESIDENTS LIVE AND WORK. IT WILL BE AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP IN MAKING MORE RESILIENT AT THE VULNERABLE POPULATIONS AND THE ECONOMIC FABRIC OF OUR CITIES. THEREFORE THE U. S. RESILIENCY COUNCIL URGES AN AYE VOTE ON THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WELCOME. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MADE MEMBERS I AM ALICIA WILKINS BOARD MEMBER FOR THE FAIR HOUSING COUNCIL OF RIVERSIDE COUNTY. AND A RESIDENT OF THE CITY OF TO MATCH TO MACULA. WHEN IT COMES TO EARTHQUAKE SAFETY CALIFORNIANS WEALTHIEST COMMUNITIES FAR OUT. RANK ARE STATES. WORKING CLASS NEIGHBORHOODS MANY OF THEM ARE INCLUDING BEVERLY HILLS SANTA MARK I'M SANTA MONICA AND SAN FRANCISCO. HAVE MAPPED OUT BUILDINGS THAT ARE PROVEN TO BE VULNERABLE TO FAILURE AND A MAJOR EARTHQUAKE. AND ARE REQUIRING RETROFIT TO PROTECT THOSE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN. THOSE AREAS. WE DON'T SEE THIS HAPPENING IN OUR WORKING CLASS COMMUNITIES BE CITIES DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO MAP OUT AND ASSESS. THE POTENTIAL DESTRUCTION THEIR COMMUNITIES FACE SHOULD THE BIG ONE STRIKE. WHILE IT MAY SEEM FAR FETCHED THE BIG ONE STRIKING ON WE HAVE TO. YOU KNOW BEAR IN MIND THE FACT THAT THE NORTHRIDGE EARTHQUAKE HAPPENED NEARLY TWO DECADES AGO. SO SCIENTISTS NOW PREDICT THAT A MAJOR EARTHQUAKE COULD BRING UP TO FORTY FIVE TIMES THAT THE DESTRUCTION OF THE NORTH UMBRAGE EARTHQUAKE. SURPASSING HURRICANE KATRINA AS THE NATION'S MOST EXPENSIVE AND NATURAL DISASTER IN HISTORY. AND THAT'S WHY I AM HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY SIX EIGHTY ONE BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER. NOW KNOWS ARYAN. I BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL WILL HELP CITIES NOT JUST THE RICH ONES ASSESSED THE VULNERABILITIES WITH DATA THAT'S NEEDED TO PERFORM. I'M A RISK ASSESSMENT SO I ASK FOR YOUR YES VOTE ON AB TWENTY SIX. THANKS VERY MUCH EIGHT OTHERS AND OFTEN SUPPORT. NICHOLAS DELUCA HERE WE HAVE THE CITY OF OAKLAND IN SUPPORT WHEN I THINK THE SILLY MEMORIES AND A LOT FOR SEISMIC SAFETY OVER THE PAST COUPLE YEARS WE REALLY APPRECIATE IT SO THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS ANDREW AND WE WOULD SHOW YOU OVER AND WE HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF LOS ANGELES MAYOR ERIC GARCETTI. WE'VE PUT TOGETHER A VERY COMPREHENSIVE SUSTAINABILITY PLAN HAVING A REAL. AND A TRUE ASSESSMENT OF OUR RISK AND AVAILABILITY IN COMING UP WITH THAT EARLY PLAN THE START CHIPPING AWAY AT THE EXPOSURE. IS A BIG PART OF OUR STRATEGY AND WE THINK THIS BILL IS CONSISTENT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME IS DON XIN SKIN HERE ON BEHALF THE STRUCTURAL ENGINEERS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE MISTRESS AARON'S LEADERSHIP. ARE ON THIS BILL AND OTHERS. WE'RE A LITTLE BIT OF A TWEENER OUT WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE INVENTORY ASPECT OF THE BILL. WEEKS WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THAT INVENTORY IS BOTH LOGISTICALLY FEASIBLE AND ACTUALLY FUND OF ALL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I'M HEIDI TRAMAINE I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE EARTHQUAKE ENGINEERING RESEARCH INSTITUTE WE'RE HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. WE ARE WORKING TUNING TO WORK WITH NAZARIAN ON ON FURTHER AMENDMENTS THAT WILL. ALLOW IT TO BE A STREAMLINED PROCESS FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND BUILDING OWNERS THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OTHER OTHERS I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. SING THEN WE'LL MOVE ON TO OPPOSITION ANYONE THAT'S IS IN OPPOSITION. WELCOME. A GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS. CREAM GREASY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS A WE CURRENTLY HAVE AN OPPOSING WAS AMENDED POSITION ON THE BILL. SPECIFICALLY WERE OPPOSED THE BILL UNLESS IT'S AMENDED TO ENSURE THAT ONEROUS STANDARDS ARE NOT PLACED ON SMALL PROPERTY OWNERS AS WELL AS ENSURING THAT BOTH SELLERS AND BROKERS. INVOLVED IN TRANSACTIONS ARE REGARDING POTENTIAL POTENTIAL VULNERABLE BUILDINGS I CAN PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION TO PERSPECTIVE BUYERS THROUGH THE. COMMERCIAL PROPERTY OWNERS GUIDE FOR EARTHQUAKE SAFETY I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR EXPRESSING A WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH US AND WE ARE CURRENTLY IN NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE AUTHOR IN THE AUTHORS OFFICE. OF AN UNFORTUNATE WE HAVE YET TO REACH AN AGREEMENT SO TODAY I MUST RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A NO VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY OTHER WITNESSES OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE ARE THERE ANY COMMENTS. FROM THE COMMITTEE. SOME REMEMBER WALDRON. THE. THANK YOU MISTER THIS AREA AND I HAVE WE HAD SPOKEN AND I WENT BACK TO LOOK BECAUSE I HAD VOTED NO ON THIS BILL AND. SHE ALSO I WANTED TO SEE WHY. SO I. MADE SOME NOTES. OKAY SO THE OTHER ANY EXEMPTIONS IN THE BILL. FOR THINGS LIKE. HISTORIC BUILDING. MY CITY HAS A HUGE AREA OF THE YOU KNOW. THE PROPERTIES THAT ARE LISTED ON. THE. VOTE AND REGISTER LIST OF HISTORIC PLACES. AND I KNOW THERE ISN'T AN EXEMPTION WELL YES THERE'S THERE ARE EXEMPTIONS TO TO CERTAIN BUILDINGS. HISTORIC NO. BUT I WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH YOU ON THAT HIGH I I'M NOT A NEXT STRUCTURAL ENGINEER EXPERT. SO I'D I'D LEAVE IT TO THE EXPERTS TO FIGURE OUT. WHAT THE PARAMETERS OF THAT SHOULD BE IF YOU'RE COMFORTABLE WITH THAT? BUT. THAT I THINK THAT WAS MORE OF AN OVERSIGHT IF ANYTHING. A. AND AND THE EXEMPTIONS ALSO ARE ON NOW. YEAH SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENCES OF COURSE UP UNTIL FOUR UNITS. AND. ALSO HOSPITALS AND. FEDERAL AND STATE BUILDINGS AND. SCHOOL FACILITIES BECAUSE ALL OF THOSE ALSO HAVE OTHER STANDARDS AND OTHER THE OVERSIGHT FORGET ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE OVERSIGHT OVER THEM. SO THERE ARE EXEMPTIONS. BUT HISTORICAL. NOT NOT IN THE BILL. OKAY. YOU KNOW HOW I COULD FEEL ENOUGH THAT. ASSEMBLYMAN OF MANY OF THE HISTORICAL BUILDINGS IN CALIFORNIA ARE UNREINFORCED MASONRY AND THEY WERE ALREADY ADDRESSED BY A PREVIOUS. LEGISLATION THIS LEGISLATION DOESN'T FOCUS ON UNREINFORCED MASONRY BUILDINGS SO SOME OF THOSE AREN'T SO SOME OF THOSE HISTORIC BUILDINGS WOULD NOT BE INCLUDED IN THIS LETTER. OKAY. SO THEN ANOTHER ONE OF MY REASONS FOR NOT SUPPORTING THE BILL. WHEN I'VE THAT'S WHY ONE OF LET YOU KNOW BECAUSE WE HAD TALKED ABOUT. THE YOU KNOW OLDER CITIES MANY OF WHICH YOU KNOW CLOSING THE CITY OF ESCONDIDO AS ONE OF THEM. INCORPORATED IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT THE WHOLE URBAN CORE. AS FAR AS THEM THE DEATH HISTORIC DOWNTOWN AND THAT WHOLE AREA HAS BUILDINGS THAT WERE BUILT. YOU KNOW AND EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN FIFTIES IN FACT THE BUILDING WHERE MY BUSINESS WAS SIDES WAS BUILT IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY. THERE'S BEEN. YOU KNOW NUMEROUS ATTEMPTS TO AREA THE SEWER SYSTEMS EVERYTHING IS OUTDATED BUT. TO BE ABLE TO I MEAN LITERALLY THE WHOLE URBAN FOR WOULD BE PART OF CONSIDERED VULNERABLE AND I THINK THAT. IT THIS INCLUDING THE FACT THAT. PARSEE. HAS. A LARGE. SEGMENT OF LOW INCOME POPULATION. HERE THIS WOULD IMPACT. THEM FINANCIALLY AS WELL BECAUSE NOT ONLY IS YOU KNOW YOUR BILL AS TRYING TO GET THE LIST PUT TOGETHER ONCE THAT'S THERE IT ALMOST CREATES A STIGMA OF SORTS ONTO THE VALUE OF THE PROPERTY. I COULD NEVER SELL IT UNLESS IT GETS FIXED EVEN THOUGH IT MAY END UP NOT REALLY NEEDING TO BE RETROFITTED SO. THOSE WERE MY CONCERNS AND Y. I HAD VOTED LOW CHAIR OKAY. BUT HE WON. CONCERNED AND I THANK YOU FOR RAISING THAT HIGH OBVIOUSLY THE INTENTION OF THIS BILL IS NOT TO PUT ANY ONE LOCAL JURISDICTION. UNDER SUCH DIRE CIRCUMSTANCES TO NOT MAKE THE MEET CERTAIN GOALS. IN FACT IDEA. HAVE WANTED TO. LOOK AT MAYBE A AT AND THIS IS WHY MAYBE IT'S AN APPROPRIATE TIME TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE. CONCERNS OF THE REALTORS. AT THE THE BILL ITSELF HAS THREE COMPONENTS IT'S THE INVENTORY IT'S THE EVALUATION AND THE MITIGATION THE MEDICATION OBVIOUSLY BEING THE MOST COSTLY. THE EVALUATION HAVING COST TO IT BECAUSE OF HAVING TWO. OF THE FOUR PROPERTY OWNER TO ATTAIN A STRUCTURAL. ENGINEER AND GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS. GIVEN THE INVENTORY IS. THE RELATIVELY MOST COST EFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE BILL AND ONE OF THE. HEARING SOME OF THESE CONCERNS HEARING THE CONCERN FROM THE REALTORS ALSO. INSTEAD OF JUST TAKING THE AMENDMENTS WHAT WHAT TO OF THE AMENDMENTS ARE FINE. BUT. INSTEAD OF TAKING THE THIRD AMENDMENT MY GOAL WAS MAYBE EVEN LOOKING AT HOW WE CAN SPLIT THE BILL INTO TWO BILLS. PASS ONE PORTION THIS YEAR. THAT AT LEAST CREATES AN INVENTORY OF THE BUILDINGS AND THEN THINK ABOUT THE EVALUATION AND THE MITIGATION. AND IN THE FUTURE HERE ESPECIALLY ONCE WE'VE ESTABLISHED THE DATABASE OF THE BUILDINGS AS WELL SO. YEAH I AM SHARING THIS SO THAT YOU KNOW THAT THERE'S. A LOT OF. AND WAYS OF APPROACHING THIS AND TRYING TO ADDRESS ADDRESS THE CONCERNS. BUT BUT BOTTOM. I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT GOAL IS TO ENSURE THAT. A INVENTORY LIST ALSO. IS MOVED FORWARD WITH SO THAT WE AT LEAST KNOW WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH THEN AND I WON ALSO MENTIONED THAT ONCE AND INVENTORY IS DONE. IT DOESN'T BRING ABOUT. A LIABILITY FOR THE BUILDING OWNERS WHEN THE BUILDING OWNERS. PURCHASED THE BUILDING THEY ALREADY. JUST THE LIABILITY WITH IT. SO I I I THAT I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S NOT A CONCERN. IF IF IT WAS IN THE BACK OF YOUR MIND. OKAY THIS WITH YOU KNOW WE HAVE A LOT OF FOLKS DON'T SPEAK ENGLISH. SO THEY WOULD BE IMPACTED. AS WELL AS ONCE. IF PROPERTY LISTED. AS A VULNERABLE BUILDING. THEN WOULD THE INSURANCE COMPANY THE HAND SURE IS THAT WOULD BE NOTIFIED. THAT IT WAS NOW ON THE VULNERABLE LIST I MEAN THAT COULD BE AN ISSUE PEOPLE. YOU KNOW. I'M I'M TALKING ABOUT FOLKS IN A WHO CAN AFFORD TO HAVE A STRUCTURAL ENGINEER WHO ARE NOT GOING TO BE INVOLVED IN A LOT OF THE GOVERNMENT THINGS GOING ON. DO YOU KNOW THAT THAT I NEED TO THINK ABOUT THIS TO JUST MENTION IT BUT YOU KNOW NOW WHERE DOES THAT SAY WE COME IN WITH% INSURANCE COMPANIES NOW WHO. ARE ENSURING THAT PROPERTY. OKAY THIS IS ONE OF ONLY LIST THEY MAY SAY ESPECIALLY SINCE WE'RE IN A HIGH FIRE RISK AREAS IT IS A HEN HAS CANDEAL. OKAY HANDS OFF THAT PROPERTY CAN'T BE LIVED IN AND TOLD WHEN INSURANCES OR THAT STRUCTURES. TAKING CARE WHETHER IT'S VULNERABLE ON NOT ULTIMATELY. I CAN RESPOND TO THAT ASSEMBLYMAN AND. I'VE DONE A LOT OF WORK WITH THE INSURANCE COMPANIES NGUYEN DAY ENSURE A BUILDING THEY ACTUALLY GET MORE DETAILED INFORMATION ON THE BUILDING THEN IT'S BILL WOULD EVEN REQUIRE A COURSE THAT INFORMATION ISN'T PUBLIC SO. STATE IS NEVER ACCESS TO IT BUT INSURANCE COMPANIES UNDERSTAND THE AGE OF THE BUILDING THE MATERIAL WAS MADE OUT OF AND GENERALLY WHETHER IT'S ON THEIR REVIEW OF A BOOK VULNERABLE LEST AND THAT CERTAINLY GOES TOWARDS WHERE THEY GET THEIR QUICK INSURANCE CANNOT AFFORD IT. SO I THINK THAT ISSUE IS SORT OF ALREADY IMBEDDED INTO WHAT THE INSURANCE COMPANIES GET A IN TERMS OF THE COST OF THE STRUCTURAL ENGINEER. AYE IN WORKING WITH THE VARIOUS INTEREST GROUPS THAT ARE INTERESTED MAKING SURE THERE'S NOT A LARGE BURDEN ON THE OWNER. AS THE ASSEMBLYMAN SAID THIS BILL IS PRIMARY EIGHT PRIMARILY IN INVENTORY WITH A VERY SHORT IT'S REALLY LITTLE IT TWO PAGE DOCUMENT THAT FEMA PRODUCES. THAT WOULD BE FILLED OUT BY AN ENGINEER THAT TAKES MAYBE FIFTEEN MINUTES TO A HALF AN HOUR TO COMPLETE. AND THAT WOULD BE THE INTENDED SORT OF ASSESSMENT OR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION OF THE BUILDING THAT WOULD BE GATHERED THAT WOULD HELP. PROVIDE A LOT OF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND HOW THE THAT THE CITY IN THE STATE IS GOING TO PERFORM YOU KNOW IN A HOLE OUT WITH AN EARTHQUAKE. SO I HOPE THAT ADDRESSES AT LEAST LIMIT THE COST FOR THE ENGINEER. ASSEMBLY CABALLERO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR. WE HAD A CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS OF BILL I HAVE MANY OF THE SAME CONCERNS THAT MISS WALDRON HAS. HAVING GONE THROUGH THE. UNREINFORCED MASONRY. REQUIREMENTS IN A CITY THAT WAS BUILT IN THE EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS WITH A LOT OF UNREINFORCED MASONRY. AT WORK. AND IT TOOK THE CITY OF SALINAS MANY YEARS TO GET COMPLIANCE BECAUSE OUR DOWNTOWN WAS SUFFERING. AS OLD DOWNTOWNS TEND TO WITH VACANCIES AND. SO WAS A REAL CHALLENGE IN THE ONLY WAY WE EVER GOT COMPLIANCE WAS TO PONY UP MONEY. AND TO MAKE MONEY AVAILABLE IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO MAKE IT ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE FOR IT FOR THAT. PROPERTY OWNER SO. I'M VERY HESITANT TO START. CREATING NEW OBLIGATIONS I UNDERSTAND THAT THE RISK AND PART OF THAT IS IS IS IT'S A RISK ANALYSIS YOU HOPE NOTHING BAD HAPPENS IN. AND THE REASON THAT AND REINFORCED MASONRY BECAME UP PRIORITY IS BECAUSE SOMETHING BAD DID HAPPEN THAT I LOOKED BY I'M WITH YOU ON THE INVENTORY THE REST OF IT HAS ME CONCERNED JUST BECAUSE ON. ANYTHING THAT COST. THAT STARTS TO COST MONEY BECOMES A CONCERN WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO PUT MONEY IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO MAKE IT ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE SO I'M PREPARED TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY. I'M WILL RESERVE. KIND OF JUDGMENT AS YOU MOVE THROUGH THE PROCESS YOU'RE LOOKING AT DIFFERENT OPTIONS. I THINK IT'S GOOD FOR US TO KNOW WHAT BUILDINGS ARE AT RISK IN PARTICULAR. MY MY CONCERN IS. ARE THESE. OLDER. APARTMENT BUILDINGS THAT WERE BUILT SO THAT YOU CAN PARK UNDERNEATH AND THEN YOU. MAY LIVE ABOVE IT THAT THEY DON'T HAVE THIS STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY THAT YOU'D WANT HAVE NOWADAYS. AND THOSE ARE SOME OF OUR POOREST IN OUR POOREST NEIGHBORHOOD SO TO HAVE THAT INFORMATION I THINK WOULD BE GOOD. BUT THEN WE'RE GONNA NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW ARE WE GONNA FIND ANY RETROFITS. AND HOW HOW CAN WE MAKE IT ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE SO THEN WE'RE NOT PUSHING OUT ALL OF THESE PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN THOSE APARTMENTS. EITHER YOU GOT A RED TAG THEM OR YOU GOTTA BRING THEM UP AND IF THE BRING HIM UP MEANS THEY CAN'T AFFORD IT ANYMORE IN IN IN A MARKET RIGHT NOW THAT IS ALREADY AND AFFORDABLE. THEN WE'RE GONNA BE IN TROUBLE SO I I JUST. I I LOOK AT THAT IN IN RURAL RURAL COMMUNITIES IT'S PROBABLY LESS OF AN ISSUE BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE AS MANY MORE TAKE STORY STRUCTURES. BUT. BUT. I MEAN YOU KNOW WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS AND I THINK YOU UNDERSTAND SOME OF THE CONCERNS I HAVE. WITH THAT I AM PURPOSE I'LL SUPPORT OF TODAY. THANK YOU I DO I DO UNDERSTAND AND I SHARE. MOST OF THE SENTIMENT ALSO. S. ASSEMBLYMEMBER COOLEY. VERY SAME BILL I. I LOOK FORWARD TO SUPPORTING IT TODAY. I THINK. BECAUSE I STILL ON THE STATE'S SEISMIC SAFETY COMMISSION IS MY SECOND TENURE THERE I WAS FIRST APPOINTED MARSH WERE STATE WAS A CITY OFFICIAL. I ACTUALLY FIRST TOUCHY ISSUE OVER OF QUAKE IS A SENIOR AT CAL WORK WITH A BAG DOING A BAY AREA INVENTORY OF. EARTHQUAKE VULNERABILITY IN THE YEARS AFTER THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY EARTHQUAKE NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE. I WAS CHIEF COUNSEL IN THIS HOUSE TO THE EFFORT I COMMITTEE DURING THE TIME THE LOMA PRIETA AT OUR RESPONSE TO LOMA PRIETA. ARM. IN GENERAL I THINK WHEN I LOOK AT THIS THIS IS AN INVENTORY. SINCE. THE NORTHRIDGE EARTHQUAKE SINCE THE LOWER PAID EARTHQUAKES A SENSE OF STANDING THAT SAN FERNANDO VALLEY. THERE ARE SO MANY GUIDES THE STATE'S ISAAC STATE TO COMMISSION HAS PRODUCED DEALING WITH. TYPICAL CONSTRUCTION ISSUES WHAT YOU NEED TO DO SAFE COURTHOUSE. THE INVENTORY JUST FORMALIZING A LEVEL OF INFORMATION IS BROADLY AVAILABLE THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. IN ALL MANNER CITIES IS HOW SOFT STORY CONSTRUCTION GARAGE UNDERNEATH. HUGE PROBLEM IT AND IN THE WAKE OF NORTHRIDGE THERE'S TREMENDOUS PUBLICITY ALL OF CALIFORNIA ABOUT THOSE ISSUES. IRREGULAR CONSTRUCTION SO IF YOU HAVE A HOME THAT HAS A. NOT NOT A RECTILINEAR DESIGN THAT'S A VULNERABILITY THE INSURANCE COMPANIES I WAS EIGHTEEN YEARS IN HOUSE COUNSEL STATE FARM INSURANCE. THEY ALL KNOW WHEN THE BUILDING WAS BUILT THEY KNOW WHEN THE WHEN. THE FOUNDATION TO BE BOLTED TO THE STRUCTURE. THEY KNOW ALL OF THAT INFORMATION IS OUT THERE. I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THE POSITION OF THE REALTORS. ARE. NINETEEN EIGHTY FOR THE EASTERN VERSUS TRASH BURGER DECISION WAS THE MAIN DECISION IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES AND INCREASE THE POTENTIAL EXPOSURE. OF REALTORS. TO KNOWING FACTS ABOUT A HOUSE OF THEIR CHAU ON SOMEONE'S RESPONSE TO THAT WAS A LAND MOVEMENT CASE. ARE WE HAVE AN ARE CIVIL CODE TO TRANSFER DISCLOSURE STATEMENT THAT WAS ADDED AS A CONSEQUENCE THE EASTERN DECISION. TO SORT OF ESTABLISH JUST. WE JUST. ADDRESS OUR LIABILITY BY INFORMING YOU OF WHAT THE FACTS ARE CONSTRUED PROPERTY. REALTORS DON'T HAVE TO THORNY SWITCHES ARE DOING WORK THAT YOU JUST PROVIDED DISCLOSURE STATEMENT. THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY AMENDED ADD THE ALL ALQUIST PRIOLO SIZING. ZONES DISCLOSURE WHICH IS ALSO PART OF THAT. SO THE GENERAL ISSUES OF LIABILITY THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS YOU DON'T OVER THE YEARS TO COME TO EASE THE BURDEN ON REALTORS. THEY ALL STEM FROM THE EAST EASTON DECISION THERE SO MUCH INFORMATION OUT THERE FOR PROPERTY OWNERS BUT PEOPLE DO NEED TO RECOGNIZE WHAT. THE RISKS ARE. SO I ACTUALLY FEEL THIS INVENTORY IS A GOOD IDEA. I THINK THE NOTION OF EVALUATION I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF CONVERSATION AROUND HOW YOU DO THAT BECAUSE THERE'S AN AWFUL LOT OF GUIDES. COMMERCIAL PROPERTY OR RESIDENTIAL PROBABLY ONE OF THE FIXES IT YOU NEED. THAT THERE MAY BE SOME WAYS TO MASSAGE THAT. SO THEN YOU GET DOWN TO HOW YOU HANDLE THE MITIGATION. AND AND THAT IS A VITAL ISSUE BUT IT'S SORT OF ON THE BACK INTO THIS. INFORMATION BECOMES VERY IMPORTANT TO TO ALLOW US TO START WORKING THROUGH THESE ISSUES. ON. SO. I I'VE ENJOYED READING THE BILL AND OBVIOUSLY IT BRINGS UP. I GOT TOO MUCH ROOM IN MY HEAD FOR YOUR IDEAL. YA BUT I DO THINK IT IS IMPORTANT I THINK IS IS A PART OF A LONG HISTORY IN CALIFORNIA GOES BACK DECADES. AND IT'S. IT'S A VITAL CALIFORNIA CONVERSATION.

ALRIGHT LET'S MOVE ON TO MY ITEM NUMBER NINE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER TING A. B. TWO EIGHT NINE ZERO WELCOME MISTER TING. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR LET ME FIRST BY THINKING YOU YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF. VIA ALSO THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THE HOUSING COMMITTEE FOR WORKING TOGETHER IN A VERY TIGHT TIMEFRAME ON A. VERY COMPLEX BILL THAT WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR GUIDANCE AND LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE SO THANK YOU SO MUCH. ARMED I DO WANT TO. IT KNOWLEDGE THAT WE ARE. ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS ON PAGE'S SIDE WHAT'S UP IN THE COMMITMENTS TO IT ADDRESSED ISSUES RAISED IN THE NLCS ON PAGES NINE AND TEN. IN PARTICULAR WE ARE REMOVING ALL. OF THE FEE PROVISIONS THAT WORD NOTICE WE DO WANT TO MAKE THAT VERY CLEAR MUCH OF THE OPPOSITION. REALLY SURROUNDED. THE FEE PROVISIONS THAT WE BELIEVE THAT THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE TAKING SHOULD BE ABLE TO REMOVE MOST OF THE CONCERNS OF. THE OPPOSITION I'M HAVING SAID THIS LET ME LET ME JUST SORT OF QUICKLY STATE WHAT THE BILL IS GOING TO HAVE IN IT. ON ONE IT'S GOING TO ALLOW EACH CD TO SUBMIT WRITTEN FINDINGS TO LOCAL AGENCY AS TO WHETHER THE ORDINANCE COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW. SPECIFIES THAT IF A LOCAL WHICH IF YOU THE NOT ADOPTED A LOCAL ORDINANCE PURSUANT TO A JUNIOR EXCEPT WE DON'T UNIT LAW. IT MUST APPLY THE STANDARDS IN JUNIOR EXCEPT FOR GROWING UNIT LAW FOR THE PROOF OF THE PERMIT TO CONSTRUCT A JUNIOR ACCESSORY. DWELLING UNIT REQUIRES EACH CD TO CREATE SMALL HOMEBUILDING STANDARDS TO APPLY THE E. D. USED BY DURING YOUR FIRST TWENTY TWENTY. REQUIRES PERMITS TO BE ISSUED BY EIGHTY USE OR JT USED TO SIXTY DAYS RATHER THAN HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS. PROHIBITS A LOCAL AGENCY FROM ENACTING ORDINANCE TO APPLIED LA COVERAGE LOTS SITES WERE FLOOR. AREA RATIO REQUIREMENTS TO EIGHTY USE. THAT PROVIDES THAT IF A LOCAL AGENCY HAS AN OWNER OCCUPIED REQUIREMENT THAT THE DEPARTMENT SHOULD NOT BE MONITORED. MORE THAN ONCE ANNUALLY AND CREATE AN EXEMPTION FOR TRUSTS FOR SENIORS DISABLED AND NON PROFITS ARE IN ALLOWS MINISTER WITH APPROVAL OF THE BELOW EIGHT JUNIOR EIGHTY YOU. AND EIGHTY YOU IN IN EXISTING SPACE OR THAT IS NEW CONSTRUCTION OF UP TO EIGHT HUNDRED SQUARE FEET NO TALLER THAN SIXTEEN FEET WITH AT LEAST FOUR FEET OF SETBACKS. UPON AS WELL AS THE EIGHTY USING MULTI FAMILYBUILDING AREAS THAT ARE NOT USED AS LIVABLE SPACE HAS LONG WITH A SPACES MEET BUILDING CODES. I IT ALSO PROHIBITS LOCAL AGENCIES FROM ACQUIRING A CORRECTION OF EXISTING ZONING NONCONFORMING IMPROVEMENT AS A CONDITION OF GRANTING MINISTER APPROVAL. AND PROHIBITS MINISTER ONLY APPROVED EIGHTY USE FROM BEING USED AS SHORT TERM RENTALS. BY AS YOU KNOW WE'RE FACING A CRISIS TOO MUCH OF A CALIFORNIA WE BELIEVE ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS IS A FAST WAY TO GET. ON SOME OF THE NEEDED TO HOUSING SUPPLY AYE IN A QUICK AND AFFORDABLE MANNER WE'VE SEEN THIS. UP TO BE USED IT IN MY CITY SAN FRANCISCO BUT ALSO INTO MANY CITIES AROUND CALIFORNIA. I HAVE ON TWO WITNESSES THAT'LL ON MUCH MORE ELOQUENTLY TALK ABOUT THE THE NEED AND. GOT MECHANICS OF PUBLIC TRYING TO ACHIEVE. YOU DID A FINE JOB THING WELCOME. HI MY NAME IS DENISE PING STAN. I'M A FORMER CURRENT PLANNING CHIEF AND I IT CURRENTLY IN MY A VOLUNTEER CAPACITY I'M A MEMBER OF THE BAY AREA COUNCIL HOUSING COMMITTEE THE COMMITTEE TO HOUSE THE BAY AREA OF THE SPUR HOUSING COMMITTEE. AND I'VE BEEN HERE FOR A COUPLE DAYS IS A VOLUNTEER TALKING TO THE STATE LEGISLATURE. AND I SWEAR TO NOTE THE IRONY THAT FOR THE PROFESSIONAL PLANNING COMMUNITY TO COME OUT FULL THROATED LEE AND ENDORSE AYE DIFFICULT HOUSING POLICY REQUIRES THAT WE NOT BE PERSONALLY ANY LONGER AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT SERVICE. SO TO THE PEOPLE SITTING HERE TODAY ARE FORMER CURRENT PLANNING CHIEFS WE KNOW INTIMATELY WHAT HAPPENS IN A LOCAL GOVERNMENT PLANNING OFFICE WE WROTE THE STAFF REPORTS WE DENIED EIGHTY YEARS BACK WHEN THEY WERE COMPLAINT WAS OWNING. IT AND WE'RE HERE TODAY IN A COALITION A BROAD COALITION OF FORMER AND CURRENT PLANNING STAFF PEOPLE IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT TODAY. ARE ENVIRONMENTALISTS LABOR BUSINESS HAUSER'S PROFESSIONAL PLANNERS REALTORS ARE BECAUSE WE ALL UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE NOT UNDER THE PRESSURE OF THE FIFTY PEOPLE ON THE PUBLIC HEARING YOU DON'T WANT US TO DO SOMETHING. HOW IMPORTANT IT IS FOR THE STATE TO PROVIDE LEADERSHIP? CONTINUITY AND CLARITY SO THAT HOMEOWNERS WHO WANT TO HELP ON THE HOUSING CRISIS CAN GET THE BUILDING PERMITS THAT STATE LAW TODAY SAYS THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET MINISTERIAL A. THIS BILL PROVIDES CERTAINTY FOR OWNERS YOU KNOW IF THIS BILL PASSES YOU'LL BE ABLE TO GET AT LEAST AN EIGHT HUNDRED SQUARE FOOT EIGHTY YOU ON YOUR PROPERTY WITH A BUILDING PERMIT. WITH FIX SET BACKS AND THE REASONABLE HEIGHT LIMIT REGARDLESS OF THE LOT STANDARD OR THE OTHER. ZONING BARRIERS THAT TYPICALLY CITIES USE WHEN THEY WANT TO DISCOURAGE EIGHTY USE TO KEEP ANYONE FROM GETTING ONE THERE IF THERE COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA THAT SET THEIR MINIMUM LOT SIZE SO HIGH FOR EXAMPLE. THAT VIRTUALLY NONE OF THE LOTS IN THE CITY ARE ELIGIBLE TO EVER HAVE BEEN EIGHTY YOU. AND AND THESE CHANGES WERE ADOPTED AFTER THE TWENTY SIXTEEN TWENTY SEVENTEEN LAWS WERE CHANGED. WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME VOLUNTEERING TO HELP HOMEOWNERS DO THIS WORK. WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH TO YOU CALIFORNIA UNIVERSITIES NORTH AND SOUTH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY AND THEIR FOLKS WERE STUDYING EIGHTY YOU ADOPTION AND ABSORPTION AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. AS WELL AS UCLA CITY ALLOWED WHO HAVE BEEN REALLY THE EIGHTY YOU LEADERS ALONG WITH. ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOM IN IN LEADING THE STATE ON THESE EIGHTY YOU POLICIES AND YOU DON'T SEE THE PROBLEMS TO YOUR KINDA IN THE WEEDS OF A LOCAL GOVERNMENT PLANNING OFFICE AND THAT'S WHERE WE'VE BEEN. SO WE'RE HERE TO SHARE WITH YOU THE LESSONS OF THE WEEDS FOR WE'VE LEARNED THE BARRIERS STILL EXIST WEEK WE THOUGHT WE FIX THEM WITH COUPLE STATE WAS WE DIDN'T. AND THIS WALL WILL REMOVE THOSE BARRIERS TO PROVIDE HOMEOWNER CERTAINTY. TO MAKE SAFETY THE PRIORITY INSTEAD OF UP CONCERNED ABOUT. MEETING THE LETTER A EVERY ZONING POSSIBLE BARRIER THAT'S POSSIBLE SO THAT HOMEOWNERS WHO WANTED BUILDING EIGHTY YOU. CAN GET A BUILDING PERMIT BECAUSE IF THEY CAN'T EASILY GET A BUILDING PERMIT. LIKE IT'S NOT THEY'RE GOING TO BUILD AN ILLEGALLY. THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF ILLEGAL AB USING CALIFORNIA TODAY CITIES OF A BELL IN LOS ANGELES HAVE MORE THAN FIFTY PERCENT OF ALL NEW HOUSING BUILT. AS ILLEGAL EIGHTY USE AND THOSE HOMEOWNERS CAN'T GET A BUILDING PERMIT IF THEY CAN'T MEET THE ZONING STANDARDS WHICH ARE ON OFTENTIMES SET TO PREVENT THEM FROM GETTING THE BUILDING PERMIT FOR AN EIGHTY YEAR THAT STATE LAW SAYS THEY SHOULD HAVE. FINALLY THIS BLOG NOW PROMOTES BEST PRACTICES TO ENCOURAGE EIGHTY ADOPTION IN EVERY COMMUNITY INCLUDING ALLOWING EIGHTY USE IT AND AND GENERATE USE THAT HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE IN CALIFORNIA'S FIRE ZONES IN THIS BEEN STRONGLY ENDORSED BY PROFESSIONAL PLANNERS IN THE FIRE ZONES. AS A WAY TO QUICKLY GET MORE OF THESE ADOPTED. AND TO ALLOW EIGHTY USE IN THE I'M YOU SPACES LIKE IS NOT IN SOME PLACES A BUILDING OWNER MIGHT TRY TO ILLEGALLY PUT SOMEBODY DOWN THERE. IF YOU ALLOW THEM TO DO IT LEGALLY THEN THE PERSON WHO LIVES DOWN THERE WILL BE SAFE. AND SO THE PRIORITY OF THIS BILL IS CERTAINTY SAFETY AND BEST PRACTICES AND WITHOUT THE STATE STEPPING IN TO CREATE EVENHANDED RULES BETTER. ADOPTED BY EVERY CITY INCLUDING THE CITIES WHO MAYBE WISH THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THIS. YOU WILL HAVE UNEVEN ADOPTION AND YOU HAVE A LOT OF ILLEGAL ALIENS WHICH CREATE A HEALTH AND SAFETY PROBLEMS THROUGHOUT THE STATE'S WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS DAVID GARCIA I'M THE POLICY DIRECTOR AT UC BERKELEY TURNER CENTER FOR HOUSING INNOVATION WHICH HAS UNDERTAKEN A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF RESEARCH. IN THE AREA OF ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS AND THIS BILL. INCORPORATE SEVERAL OF OUR EVIDENCE BASED RECOMMENDATIONS FOR INCREASING EIGHTY YOU PRODUCTION ACROSS THE STATE'S ATTORNEYS CENTER CONSIDERS. ACCESSORY GOING IN IS TO BE AND THE CENTRAL PIECE OF A BROADER HOUSING SOLUTION FOR CALIFORNIA AS A SERVICE AN EFFICIENT AND COST EFFECTIVE. FORM OF HOUSING SPECIFICALLY EIGHTY USE CAN BE BUILT WITHOUT SUBSIDY FOR A FRACTION OF THE TIME AND COST IT TAKES TO BUILD TRADITIONAL HOUSING AND AS OUR OFTENTIMES RENTED AT BELOW MARKET RATES. AND TO INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE EXISTING RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE PROPERTY OWNERS SO AGING RELATIVES. THE CARETAKERS OF THE LIKE SO GIVEN THESE BENEFITS TERMS CENTER RECOMMENDS THAT POLICIES THAT REMOVE BARRIERS A DEVELOPMENT SHOULD BE PRIORITIZE IN THIS BILL CERTAINLY DOES A GREAT DEAL. TO ACCOMPLISH THAT BY. CREATING A REASONABLE DESIGN STANDARDS AND. THE CREATION OF A A SMALL STRUCTURES OF BUILDING CODE AYE THAT TOGETHER WILL. REMOVE COMPLEXITY AND. CREATE MORE INTEREST AND BUILDING PERMITS FORZEST WITHDRAWING ITSELF GIVEN THE MOMENTUM WE'VE SEEN FROM REFORMS IN PREVIOUS YEARS WE KNOW THAT'S REMOVING THESE BARRIERS ARE AN EFFECTIVE TOOL FOR CREATING. A HOUSING UNITS. QUICKLY AND VARIOUS AREAS OF THE STATE SO I'M WITH THAT I WOULD SAY THAT. IF YOU DE UM THE POLICIES IN THIS BILL ARE CONSISTENT WITH A MUCH OF OUR RESEARCH AND FINDINGS. THANK YOU OTHERS THAN IN SUPPORT NAME ORGANIZATION. POSITION. MICHAEL AND WITH THE NONPROFIT HOUSING ASSOCIATION OR THE CALIFORNIA STRONG SUPPORT. JENNIFER SPEC ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS ALSO IN SUPPORT. SO AS A MATTER THAT LIGHTHOUSE PUBLIC AFFAIRS HERE ON BEHALF OF HABITAT FOR HUMANITY CALIFORNIA'S WEALTH CALIFORNIA BE IN SUPPORT. IF THE FAMILY OF THE BRIDGE HOUSING IN SUPPORT. AB BACKER IN GI WITH A WORKING PARTNERSHIPS U. S. SAYING SAN JOSE AND SANTA CLARA COUNTY ARE REPRESENTING OUR UNITE HERE LOCAL NINETEEN AND AB T. TRONG COUNCIL SEVEN. I IN SUPPORT IF AMENDED. TO INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON SHORT TERM RENTALS BUT YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. THOSE WITNESSESIN OPPOSITION PLEASE COME FORWARD GOOD AFTERNOON. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS NANCY TRIED ASSIST BEEN ALSO HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BOARDS ASSOCIATION WHICH REPRESENTS NEARLY ONE THOUSAND OF SCHOOL AND COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION GOVERNING BOARDS. WHEN I'M NOT REPRESENTING FIVE THOUSAND ELECTED OFFICIALS I'M ALSO SCHOOL BOARD PRESIDENT HERE IN ELK GROVE UNIFIED SACRAMENTO COUNTY AND I DON'T KNOW IF IT. BOLSTERS THE ARGUMENT THAT WAS MADE BUT I'M ALSO A FORMER PLANNING COMMISSIONER SO I DON'T KNOW WHICH WAY THAT THAT SWAYS ME. UP FIRST OF ALL I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENT THAT REMOVE THE FEE PROVISIONS. SO I WILL BE VERY BRIEF ON THAT NOTE AND SAY THAT. WE IN THE EDUCATION COMMUNITY LIVE THE HOUSING CRISIS EVERY SINGLE DAY STUDENTS WHO ARE HOMELESS EXPERIENCE HOUSING INSTABILITY OR LIVE IN SUBSTANDARD HOUSING WILL CERTAINLY HAVE IMPEDIMENTS TO THEIR EDUCATION SO WE APPRECIATE BEING A PART OF THIS DISCUSSION. AND IT IS OUR HOPE THAT WE CAN WORK TOGETHER FROM A COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION THAT DOES NOT. AMELIORATE THE HOUSING CRISIS AT THE EXPENSE OF. CHILDREN'S EDUCATION SO. OUT WHEN WE SEE THOSE AMENDMENT TEMPERATE I ANTICIPATE CSPA WARMER THE TOP POSITION AND I WILL YIELD THE REMAINDER OF MY TIME. CHRISLEY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES A RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED TO THE MEASURE OUR OVERARCHING CONCERN IS ESSENTIALLY ONE THAT PROPONENTS ACTUALLY OUTLINED WITCHES WE JUST HAD A MAJOR OVERHAUL OF A DO YOU LIE IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. THE BILL'S BECAME EFFECTIVE ON JANUARY ONE TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND NOW LOCAL AGENCIES ARE NEARING THE END OF THE PROCESS OR HAVE ALREADY ADOPTED ORDINANCES THAT. I LEAST THE ORDINANCES THAT I'VE REVIEWED STANSHALL LIBERALIZE THE ABILITY TO ADDICTS THAT'S REDRAWING UNITS TO YOUR PROPERTY SO. THAT'S JUST A FUNDAMENTAL CONCERN WITH CHANGING THE STANDARDS ONCE AGAIN AFTER FOLKS HAVE ALREADY DONE ALL THE WORK TO TO UPDATE THEIR ORDINANCES AND WE DO APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENT TO REMOVE THE FEE PROVISIONS I THINK THAT'LL GO A LONG WAY TOWARDS. ADDRESSING A LOT OF OUR CONCERNS WITH THIS ISSUE BUT WE DO HAVE A REMAINING CONCERNS WITH SOME OF THE LAND USE PROVISIONS ON ONE IS THAT THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW YOU TO USE AND NON RESIDENTIAL ZONES. AND WE THINK THERE'S A PUBLIC POLICY INTEREST IN MAKING SURE THAT IF YOU ARE ON AN INDUSTRIAL ZONE PARCEL AND YOU HAVE A PREEXISTING. LEGAL NONCONFORMING RESIDENTS THEN WHY WOULD WE WANT TO AND MORE RESIDENTIAL USES AND INTENSIFY THE RESIDENTIAL USE. AND INCREASE THE POTENTIAL FOR CONFLICTS WITH SURROUNDING INDUSTRIAL OR COMMERCIAL OR AGRICULTURAL LANDS AND WE THINK THAT THIS BILL PRECLUDES LEGITIMATE RESTRICTIONS ON PARCEL SIZES IN THE UNINCORPORATED AREA. AS EVERYONE HERE PROBABLY KNOWS A LOT OF UNINCORPORATED AREAS DON'T HAVE COMMUNITY WATER OR SEWER SO. PARCEL SIZE IS AN IMPORTANT SCREENING CRITERIA TO DETERMINE IF THERE'S LIKELY TO BE ROOM FOR THE SEPTIC AND WELL THAT WILL BE NECESSARY ESPECIALLY FOR ADDING. AS LOTS OF RURAL COUNTIES ALLOW VERY LARGE ACCEPTS REDRAWING UNITS PLASTER COUNTY'S ORDINANCE ACTUALLY IF YOU HAVE A PARCEL OVER FIVE ACRES IN SIZE HAS NO RESTRICTION ON THE AMOUNT OF ACCESSORY. RESIDENTIAL USES THAT CAN BE ADDED TO THE PROPERTY SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ESSENTIALLY ADDING A SECOND HOME IN THAT CONTEXT. AND WE ALSO THINK THAT THIS BILLS INCLUSION OF LANGUAGE THAT'S POPPED UP IN OTHER PLACES THAT ALLOWS THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. TO ADOPT GUIDELINES AND FOR THE REVIEW OF THESE LOCAL ORDINANCES WITHOUT GOING THROUGH A FORMAL RULE MAKING PROCESS I'M IS INAPPROPRIATE AND WE HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE PREPONDERANCE OF EVIDENCE STANDARD WE THINK IT'LL BE VERY DIFFICULT. FOR LOCAL AGENCIES TO MAKE PUBLIC POLICY DECISIONS SUCH AS RESTRICTING ACCEPTS REDRAWING UNITS IN HIGH FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY AREAS WHERE WE LIKELY DON'T WANT TO ENCOURAGE ADDITIONAL RESIDENTIAL INTENSITY. AND ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO MEET THAT STANDARD I'M FINALLY WE ARE LITTLE BITCONFUSED WITH THE ADDITION OF THE JUNIOR ACCEPTS REDRAWING UNIT LANGUAGE WHICH UP TO THIS POINT HAS BEEN OPTIONAL. ESPECIALLY SINCE I'M YOU ARE ALLOWED TO DO UNDER EXISTING LAW CONVERSIONS OF EXISTING RESIDENTIAL SPACE OR NOT NECESSARILY SURE THAT THAT PROVISION IS. REQUIRED UP SO FOR THOSE REASONS AND WE'RE HOPING TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE TO RESOLVE OUR MEANING REMAINING CONCERNS. DEFINITELY APPRECIATE THE CHANGES RELATED TO FEES BUT WE DO HAVE AN OVERRIDING CONCERN ABOUT CONSTANTLY CHANGING THE RULES. FOR EXCESSIVE GROWING UNITS. THANK YOU OTHER THAT WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. CAPTION NOON ROUNDER ROSSI WITH THE CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION WOULD JUST LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR IN THE COMMITTEE FOR TODAY'S AMENDMENTS WITH THEM WE SHOULD BE NEUTRAL IN THE BILL. IAN TO DEAL WITH THE COALITION FOR ADEQUATE SCHOOL HOUSING WE HAD ALSO HAD. IN OPPOSE. POSITION BUT WITH THE. AMENDMENTS WE ANTICIPATE REMOVING THOSE. A MENTOR MEMBERS JASON RILEY CALIFORNIA CITIES A WE ARE NOT A AGAINST EIGHTY USING ITS EXISTING LAW. BUT WE CERTAINLY ALIGNER COMMENTS WITH OUR COLLEAGUES OVER AT C. SAKON AND SHARE THOSE CONCERNS AND HOPE TO KEEP YOUR WORK WITH THE WITH THE AUTHOR. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS ARE UNABLE AND SAY REPRESENT THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION A BUT ALSO IN OUR COMMENTS WITH I'M SEE SACK APPRECIATE THEM AS TAKEN TODAY BY JUST DO WANNA ADD THAT. WE ARE CONCERNED GIVE ANOTHER TO SENATE BILLS MOVING THAT TOOK VERY DIFFERENT AMENDMENTS TODAY AND WONDER HOW THE BILL'S OWNER ASKED AS THEY MOVE FORWARD SO THANK YOU. I'M SURE MEMBERS JOINED FOR SOME BEHALF THE URBAN COUNTIES OF CALIFORNIA ALSO IN OPPOSITION ALSO VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE MOMENTS BELLI OUR COMMENTS WITH THE SOCK THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER GIRL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE OTHER BEEN QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE. SOME REMEMBER BLOOM COUPLE OF. COMMENTS FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF FOR HAVING AUTHORED DEAD TWENTY TWO AB TWENTY TWO NINETY NINE. ALONG WITH SENATOR WHITE HOUSE GIZA BILL THAT TWO BILLS THAT KINDA GOT THIS. MOVING ALONG. YOU MIGHT THINK FROM THE COMMENTS OF SOME OF THE PROPONENTS THAT HOUSING IS NOT GETTING BUILT UNDER THE. I REVISED EIGHTY YOU. LAW. AND THE FACT THAT MATTER IS ANOTHER FORTY THREE HUNDRED UNITS THAT ARE EITHER BUILT IN CONSTRUCTION OR IN THE PERMIT PROCESS. AT A ACROSS THE STATE IT'S. ACTUALLY AT A HOUSING BOOM WHEN YOU COMPARE THAT. TO THE TOTAL NUMBER OF HOUSING UNITS THAT WE'VE EXPERIENCED AN AVERAGE YEARS BEFORE WHICH IS SOMEWHERE. A IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF A HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND OR SO STATEWIDE WHICH IS A. TERRIBLE NUMBER WE NEED FAR MORE HOUSING BUT FORTY THREE HUNDRED UNITS AIN'T BAD WHEN. YOU'RE CONSIDERING ITS INDIVIDUAL UNITS. I INTERSPERSED TO MANY PLACES IN IN ADDITION. CITIES LIKE SANTA ROSA AND TO THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES ARE AND I THINK A SAN FRANCISCO AS WELL COMING UP WITH CREATIVE WAYS TO UTILIZE A EIGHTY USED IN THE CASE OF SANTA ROSA TO. HELP RECOVER FROM THE FIRE PROVIDE TO A BADLY NEEDED HOUSING BECAUSE THESE UNITS CAN BE BUILT FAR MORE QUICKLY THAN THE. THAN OTHERS THAT ARE. AGO THROUGH THE. LARGER PROJECTS ECHO THROUGH THE PERMITTING PROCESS IN LOS ANGELES. OF THEIR. IS A VERY VERY SMALL PROGRAM BUT AN INTERESTING PROGRAM TO. ENCOURAGE. FOLKS TO USE. EXCEPT DWELLING UNITS TO HOUSE HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS. I FOR A A SPOKEN WITH THE AUTHOR I SHARE SOME OF THE CONCERNS OF FOR. OF FOLKS WHO ARE. SPOKE PARTICULARLY THEA AND OF FOR. OF FOR THE PART OF THE PUBLIC COMMENT. OF THEM AND THE AUTHORS GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON. ON ALL OF THESE ISSUES ON. HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY AND IT. HOPE THAT THOSE SANTA. ANA ISSUES THAT ARE OUT THE RESULT I I I I WOULD SAY THAT I. AND. SOMEWHAT CONCERNED THAT OF THE THE POINT WAS MADE EARLIER AND IT'S IT. A CONCERN THAT I SHARE THAT. EVERY CITY HAS JUST GONE THROUGH A PROCESS OF REVISING ITS ORDINANCE HIM. ENOUGH. WE GOT A LOT OF FEEDBACK FROM CITIES THE. A ABOUT TWO MINUTES OF THEIR EXPERIENCE GOING THROUGH THAT PROCESS BECAUSE NATURALLY THEY IDENTIFIED ISSUES BUT TO ASK THEM TO NOW GO THROUGH. AT ANOTHER A SIMILAR PROCESSES. IS A LOT TO ASK I THINK GUM OF BUT THAT SAID I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY AND. SEE WHERE IT LEADS US. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOM ANY OTHER. MANY COMMENTS ASSEMBLYMEMBER COOLEY. I JUST WANT SAVINGS A VERY IMPORTANT BILL AND I'M MORE. I AM VERY SUPPORTIVE OF TODAY I THINK ONE OBSERVATION I HAVE CONCERNING THIS IS. AND I SEE THIS WAR THROUGH THE LENS OF OIL ASSEMBLY DISTRICT WHERE THE AVERAGE AGE IS CONSIDERABLY HIGHER THAN. THAT OF THE LOCAL SOME ISSUE OR SIT HERE. YOU SEE MORE AND MORE FAMILIES WHERE THE KIDS ARE AWAY THEY'VE SETTLED. MOM DAD OR IN THE HOME AND THEN. MOM OR DAD GOES TO A SENIOR LIVING ARRANGEMENT OR THEY BOTH CALLED WAS SENIOR LIVING ARRANGEMENT. AND THEN YOU START SEEN OUR RESTAURANTS AROUND THE COMMUNITY THAT HAVE BEEN THERE A LONG TIME IN A PART OF THE FABRIC COMMUNITY. YOU START SEEING RESTAURANTS CLOSE BECAUSE THERE'S NOT ENOUGH LOCAL TRAFFIC TO KEEP THEM OPEN. I SEE THIS IN THE NORTH COUNTY. SO I ACTUALLY FEEL THAT. I JUST WANT TO STATE THAT I FEEL THE. GREATER USE OF OF THIS TYPE UNIT. IS ACTUAL WAY TO HELP SUSTAIN ECONOMIC VITALITY OF A LONG ESTABLISHED COMMUNITIES. AS SORT OF PEOPLE GO THROUGH THE AGE. AGING PROCESS. I KNOW THAT I HAVE LOCAL CHAMBERS THAT A A BIG ISSUE ON THEIR RADAR SCREEN IS THE LOSS OF. RETAIL AND PEOPLE OUT IN THE COMMITTEE SPENDING MONEY AT SHOPS AND RESTAURANTS AS A BY PRODUCT OF JUST A FACT IT'S AN AGING COMMUNITY. SO I THINK THIS TYPE OF. THIS TYPE OF PRODUCT ACTUALLY. IT IS GOOD TO GET PEOPLE IN A ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD. BUT I THINK IT CONSERVE SUPPORT. YOU KNOW DENSITIES AND. IN A COMPATIBLE WAY WITHIN THE COMMUNITY AND THAT RELEASES A LOT OF POSITIVE ENERGY. THAT SUPPORTS OPENLY PROPERTY VALUES. RATHER THAN WELL YOU KNOW. THESE RESTAURANTS ARE CLOSING THE AMENITIES THAT WE ARE CUSTOM TOUR SORT OF DIMINISHING. I SEE THIS IS KINDA HELPING PULL AIR IN THE TIRES WHO DOESN'T JUST. GO FLAT. SO I THINK IT'S VERY POSSIBILITY THAT THERE'S DEFINITE ECONOMIC ARGUMENT THAT'S BIGGER. INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED. AND. SUPPORTING INDIVIDUAL PROPER WHO MIGHT WISH TO DO THIS I THINK FOR BRING IT FORWARD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR SOME MEMBER COOLEY ANY OTHER COMMENTS. OKAY WE STILL MOVED IT BILL OKAY. SOME WOMEN OKAY WE HAVE I'VE. MOTION AND A SECOND BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER CABALLERO. WHICH LIKE TO CLOSE. WHAT IS GONNA BOTH AGREE WITH FOR? OF COURSE IT'S NOT SURPRISING I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM. SANTA MONICA AND MY COLLEAGUE FROM METRO CORDOVA I DO GET A CHANCE TO READ LIKE YOU'D MENTIONED THAT THE GOOD ACTORS YOUR UPS RIGHT SAN FRANCISCO. SANTA BARBARA CINEMA HAVE ACTUALLY PASSED IN ADOPTED LOCAL ORDINANCES TO RELIEVE. EXPAND THE ADOPTION OF ANY YOU ARE THE ONE EXAMPLE THAT COMES SPEAKS DIDN'T MENTION WAS THE CITY OF ARTESIA. THEY WENT THE OTHER WAY AND THEY. PASSED A LOCAL ORDINANCE THAT ONLY ALLOWS LOTS OF TEN THOUSAND SQUARE FEET OR GREATER TO BUILD AN EIGHTY YOU. WHICH PRETTY MUCH I BELIEVE BANDS ALMOST. ARM THE ENTIRE CITY FOR BUILDING EIGHTY OR SO TO TALK THIS LEGISLATURE'S MORE IN REACTION TO THE CITIES. THAT REACTED POORLY NOT THE CITY'S WHO REACTED WELL AND IT REALLY DID WHAT WE WERE HOPING SO I THINK WE WE ARE TRYING TO THREAT THAT NEEDLE. IN VERY MUCH APPRECIATE. YOUR COMMENTS WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH SENATOR SKINNER AND Y. KOWSKI ON MAKING SURE THAT WE COME TOGETHER AS ONE. THANK YOU I LOVE HEARING THAT LET'S COLLABORATE LOW THAT. I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FOR PARTICULARLY SPENT SO MUCH TIME WITH OUR COMMITTEE AND GOING OVER VARIOUS. LOOKS OF THE AMENDMENTS.

GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY I'LL GIVE THIS MY BEST SHOT ON BEHALF OF OUR. A COLLEAGUE GOT MR MEDINA THIS BILL SEEKS TO EXPAND ON CURRENT LAW AND INFORM THE PUBLIC BY REQUIRING THAT LOCAL GOVERNING AGENCIES PROVIDE SPECIFIED INFORMATION TO THE PUBLIC. BEFORE APPROVING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT SUBSIDY FOR WAREHOUSE DISTRIBUTION CENTER. DEVELOPMENT OF WAREHOUSES IN THE INLAND EMPIRE AND AROUND THE STATE HAS GROWN TREMENDOUSLY IN RECENT YEARS. IN LARGE PART TO THE SUBSIDIES PROVIDED BY LOCAL GOVERNMENT. THE BUILDING OF MULTIPLE WAREHOUSES CAN BE SEEN AS A NET BENEFIT TO THE JOBS CREATED AND TAX REVENUE GENERATED. HOWEVER RESEARCH IS SHOWING THAT WAREHOUSES AREN'T BENEFITING TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES THEY ARE BUILT TO AND. THAT'S WHERE THIS BILL COMES IN IT'S A MODEST BILL. OF BUT VERY IMPORTANT WILL INCREASE PUBLIC TRANSPARENCY. AND HELP ENSURE NEW DEVELOPMENTS MAKES SENSE BOTH ECONOMICALLY AND ENVIRONMENTALLY BEFORE APPROVING AN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT TAXPAYER FUNDED SUBSIDY. FOR WAREHOUSE DISTRIBUTION CENTERS AND THERE ARE SEVERAL WITNESSES IN HERE TO WELL PORT WITNESSES. PLEASE. FEEL FREE TO START. I'M HIGH I'D GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS ANGIE RIKEN. AND I HAVE WORKED FOR ELEVEN YEARS AT THE KMART DISTRIBUTION CENTER RURAL MORE RIVERSIDE COUNTY. I WORK IN THE APARTMENT A UNLOADING TRAILERS. I'M AND I CURRENTLY SERVICES CHIEF SHOP STEWARD. OF THE UNION IN MY WORKPLACE. MY TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY COWORKERS AND I ARE MEMBERS OF WORKERS UNITED SEIU. BECAUSE WE HAVE A UNION ARE WORKING CONDITIONS ARE VERY DIFFERENT FROM MOST WAREHOUSES IN CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE A VOICE AT WORK. I WHEN I NEGOTIATE LIMITS ON HOW MANY TEMPORARY WORKERS THE COMPANY CAN EMPLOY WHICH MEANS MORE FULL TIME JOBS. A WE HAVE A WAY TO ADDRESS SAFETY CONCERNS INTO RAIN AND MANAGERS WHO WANT TO WORK AS FASTER THAN HUMAN POSSIBLE. AND WE HAVE ONE BETTER WAGES AND MORE PAID TIME OFF. UNFORTUNATELY MOST WAREHOUSE WORK. WAREHOUSES WORKERS MORTARS MOST WAREHOUSE WORKERS EXCUSE ME IN OUR COMMUNITY. FACE A DIFFERENT REALITY AT THE TYPICAL DISTRIBUTION CENTER MOST WORKERS ARE HIRED STAFFING AGENCIES BUT NO GUARANTEES. THAT THEY WILL STILL HAVE A JOB THE NEXT WEEK. THE COMPANIES PAY MINIMUM WAGE. FOR NEAR MINIMUM WAGE WITH LITTLE OR NO BENEFITS OR PAID TIME OFF I WORKERS HAVE NO VOICE TO ADDRESS SAFETY CONCERNS OR PULLING FROM THEIR MANAGEMENT. MANY OF THESE BIG CORPORATIONS AND ENJOY TAX INCENTIVES FOR. FROM OUR CITIES BUT THERE IS NO TRANSPARENCY ABOUT THE JOBS THEY CREATE. ONE OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT GIVES GIVEAWAY HUGE AMOUNTS OF PUBLIC MONEY WE SHOULD KNOW HOW MANY JOBS THEY WILL CREATE AND WHETHER OR NOT THEY WILL BE GOOD JOBS OR FULL TIME JOBS. AS A TAXPAYER. I BELIEVE ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE A RIGHT TO DEMAND TRANSPARENCY AND GOOD JOBS FROM ANY CORPORATION THAT BENEFITS FROM OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS PUBLIC MIGHT. THAT'S WHY WE SUPPORT AB TWENTY EIGHT VICTORY. UNION MEMBERS HAVE PROVEN THAT WAREHOUSE JOBS CAN BE GOOD JOBS. THERE IS NO EXCUSE WE MUSCLE COMPANIES ACCOUNTABLE TO CREATE GOOD JOBS IN OUR COMMUNITIES THINKING. THANK YOU. WELCOME THANK YOU. MY NAME IS SHERRY ARE COST YOU I'M THE CO EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE WAREHOUSE WORKER RESOURCE CENTER. FOR NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION BASED IN ONTARIO DEDICATED TO IMPROVING THE LIVES OF WAREHOUSE WORKERS THROUGH. ADVOCACY ACTION EDUCATION. MERIT MAJOR WAREHOUSES BEEN DEVELOPED. IN A HUGE WAVE IN THE RECENT YEARS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. THEIR OVER THREE HUNDRED MAJOR FACILITIES IN INLAND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ALONE AND GROWING CLUSTERS A CENTRAL VALLEY AS WELL AS THE EAST BAY. WELL OVER THREE OR THOUSAND WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA ARE IN THIS AND RELATED SECTORS NAM AND THAT WAS IT SECTOR OF THE ECONOMY IT'S RAPIDLY GROWING. UNFORTUNATELY COMMUNITIES ARE OFTEN PITTED AGAINST EACH OTHER. IN COMPETITION FOR TAX ABATEMENTS OF SUBSIDIES OR TO HAVE A WAREHOUSE DEVELOPED AN OPEN IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. ALL THIS BILL WOULD DO IS REQUIRE THAT THESE OPERATORS DISCLOSE THE NUMBER OF JOBS AND. THE QUALITY OF JOBS ARE BEING CREATED IN THESE COMMUNITIES. AND DIFFERENT METRICS OF COMMITTEE BENEFITS AND THEN HAVE SOME SORT OF ABILITY TO HAVE AN ACCOUNTABILITY AROUND THAT. IN THE YEARS AFTER THE WAREHOUSES DEVELOPMENT. CURRENTLY TOO MANY OF THESE JOBS ARE TEMPORARY AND PAY A LITTLE MORE THAN MINIMUM WAGE. THIS WILL THIS BILL WOULD GIVE LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND POLICY MAKERS WHO BELIEVE TO KNOW WHAT IS COMING INTO THEIR COMMUNITY. AND TO HOLD A DEVELOPERS AND WAREHOUSE OPERATES ACCOUNTABLE FOR WHAT IS PROMISED. SOME EXAMPLES OF THE KINDS OF SUBSIDIES THAT EVER OCCURRED IN CALIFORNIA. FRESNO IS PROVIDING AMAZON WITH OVER THIRTEEN PUT WITH THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS TO BUILD A WAREHOUSE IN THEIR COMMUNITY. WITH THE PROMISE OF OUR TWO THOUSAND JOBS. AMAZON THE COMPANY OWNED BY THE RICHEST MAN IN THE WORLD WHICH PAY NO FEDERAL TAXES LAST YEAR PARTLY DUE TO DEPRECIATION ON THESE VERY WAREHOUSES. IN ONTARIO QVC IS RECEIVING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TAX ABATEMENTS FROM THE CITY. AND OVER A MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA COMPETES THE CALIFORNIA COMPETES PROGRAM OF STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE NO IDEA OF THE QUALITY OF THE JOBS THAT WOULD BE CREATED BY THIS FACILITY BOMB BUT WE KNOW THERE'S NOT NEARLY AS MANY JOBS AS THEY'VE PROMISED BACK IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. JUST AS IMPORTANT. IS THAT THIS BILL WILL GIVE US THE ABILITY TO HOLD EMPLOYERS AND DEVELOPERS ACCOUNTABLE. TOO OFTEN WAREHOUSES ARE APPROVED BECAUSE OF THE PROMISE OF JOBS. BUT AFTER APPROVAL JOBS DON'T MATERIALIZE ARE TEMPORARY. SOMETIMES EMPLOYERS MISCLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES HASN'T BEEN A CONTRACTORS. OTHERS DON'T PROVIDE DECENT WAGES THIS FOR ALL THESE REASONS THAT WE ASK YOU TO MOVE AB TWENTY FIFTY THREE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF OTHER OTHERS IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL NAME AND. THAT I'M CHAIR MEMBERS THEIR FLOCKS CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION WHERE THE SPONSORS OF THE BILL I'M HERE IN SUPPORT TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHERS INSOFAR.

SEEING NONE OTHER ANY QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE. MOVE THE BILL. WE HAVE A WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND ASSEMBLYMEMBER COOLEY AND ASSEMBLYMEMBER CAVALLERO. WHICH I TO CLOSE. MISS EGGMAN THERE THIS ACTUALLY IS A. I THINK A VERY IMPORTANT BILL BECAUSE IT SPEAKS TO CHANGES THAT ARE OCCURRING IN A DAILY BASIS ON OUR ECONOMY. AS BRICK AND MORTAR A STORES CLOSED DOWN AND THE WAREHOUSE ECONOMY PICKS UP THERE'S A A A A. AND AS OTHER CHANGES TAKE PLACE IN OUR ECONOMY. OF WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE NATURE OF THE JOBS THAT HAVE BEEN LOST. AND THE JOBS THAT ARE BEING GAINED. A ONE OF THE CENTRAL QUESTIONS I THINK WE FACE AT THE CURRENT TIME IS THE DISAPPEARING MIDDLE CLASS. OUT WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE DYNAMICS THAT ARE AT WORK IN SOCIETY SO THAT WE CAN APPROPRIATELY LEGISLATE. OUR AROUND THOSE ISSUES AND FOR THAT REASON AND THE OTHER STATED HERE TODAY I RESPECTFULLYASK HER ABOUT.

I'M PLEASED TO PRESENT AB TWENTY FIFTY THE SMALL SYSTEM WATER THIRTY ACT OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN. THANK YOU. BOB THIS STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED WATER SYSTEM STATEWIDE THAT CHRONICALLY SERVED CONTAMINATED DRINKING WATER A CANNOT PROVIDE THE RESIDENTS A RELIABLE WATER SOURCE. THE SYSTEM SUFFER INADEQUATE INFRASTRUCTURE OR LACK LOCAL FINANCIAL MANAGERIAL AND TECHNICAL RESOURCES BUT A VAST MAJORITY OF THE SYSTEMS ARE SMALL RURAL SYSTEMS THAT TYPICALLY SERVE LESS THAN TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE. SO BASICALLY WHAT WE WOULD DO IS SET UP AS I AM INFRASTRUCTURE TO BE ABLE TO. HELP THESE WATER SYSTEMS TO CONSOLIDATE EVEN THOUGH GEOGRAPHICALLY THEY MAY BE. ALL OVER THE STATE SO THAT THEY CAN PROVIDE POTABLE WATER. IT IS A. A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR US THAT'S BASICALLY HOW IT WOULD WORK AS THE STATE BOARD WOULD NOTIFY THE CHRONICALLY NONCOMPLIANT SYSTEMS. AND THEY WOULD BE PROVIDED WITH AN OPPORTUNITY TO DEVELOP A PLAN. IF A PLAN IS AN APPROVED THEN THE STATE BOARD WOULD NOTIFY. LITTLE HALF GOES AND THE LAUGH GOES WOULD BE ABLE TO HELP TO FACILITATE THE CONSOLIDATION WITH ME IN SUPPORT TODAY IS JOHN GILBERT REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL. UTILITIES ASSOCIATION AND PAUL JONES GENERAL MANAGER OF EASTERN MUNICIPAL WATER DISTRICT. WELCOME SOMEONE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR STANDING AS BEST I CAN FOR DON GILBERT JASON I OCCURRED. WITH IDLE STINK GILBERT ROPES AND SMITH ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL UTILITIES ASSOCIATION. I'M VERY PROUD TO BE HERE AS A SPONSOR OF AB TWENTY FIFTY AND LIGHT OF HOW LONG YOU'RE HEARING HAS GONE AND AND HOW LATE IT IS AND HOW EAGER I'M SURE EVERYONE HAS TO BE DONE AND I'M GONNA TRY AND BE BRIEF. SEE ANYWAYS MEMBERS PROVIDE WATER SERVICE TO SEVENTY PERCENT OF CALIFORNIANS. THEY ARE IN THAT IS THEIR MISSION THEIR MISSIONS PROVIDE CLEAN DRINKING WATER AND THAT'S A MISSION THAT SHOULD BE SHARED. BY THE THE LOCAL WATER SYSTEMS THAT ARE FAILING TO DO THAT THE SMALL COMMUNITY WATER SYSTEMS THAT HAVE FAILED TO DO THAT WITH THEIR PRIVATE SYSTEMS. OR PUBLIC SYSTEMS. UNFORTUNATELY THAT THAT'S AN ISSUE THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT A LOT IN THIS BUILDING FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS NOW NOT ONLY THE CAPITAL BUT ALSO IN THE WATER COMMUNITY. THE STATE HAS SOME OF THE TOOLS THEY NEED TO SOLVE THAT PROBLEM BUT NOT ALL THE TOOLS THEY NEED TO SOLVE THAT PROBLEM. AND BY CONSOLIDATING SYSTEMS AS PROPOSED IN AB TWENTY FIFTY WE'RE GONNA CREATE ECONOMIES OF SCALE AND ALLOW OF THESE DISTRICTS TO HAVE THE TECHNICAL MANAGERIAL AND FINANCIAL CAPACITY. TO ACTUALLY PROVIDES THE SERVICE THAT THEY SHOULD BE PROVIDING ARE READY TO THEIR COMMUNITIES. AND FOR THOSE REASONS AGAIN WE'RE PROUD TO BE A SPONSOR OF THE BILL AND. WE WOULD RESPECTFULLY REQUEST TRAVAUX. THANK YOU THANK YOU CHAIR OF MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE ON PAUL JONES GENERAL MANAGER OF EASTERN MUNICIPAL WATER DISTRICT FOR AN AGENCY THAT PROVIDES WATER WASTE WATER RECYCLE WATER TO EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND RESIDENTS IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY. I'D LIKE TO THINK THAT COMMITTEE FOR TAKING A UP AB TWENTY FIFTY TODAY AND I'D ALSO LIKE TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER KEVIN EUROPE FOR BRINGING THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION FORWARD. ALSO LIKE TO RECOGNIZE HIM YOU A FOR THEIR LEADERSHIP ON THE BILL UP OVER THE PAST COURSE THAT PASSOVER YEARS I'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE INVOLVED IN SEVERAL. WATER AGENCY CONSOLIDATIONS THAT HAVE RESULTANT SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENTS IN WATER INFRASTRUCTURE RELIABILITY AND SERVICE HAVE ALSO BEEN PART OF THE DISSOLUTION AND CONSOLIDATION OF A PRIVATE WATER SYSTEM. THAT HAVE BEEN SERVING CONTAMINATE WATER TO SEVERELY DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY UP FOR NEARLY TWO DECADES AS NOTED BY THE AUTHOR THE VAST AJORITY THE SYSTEM SERVING CONTAMINATED WATER VERY SMALL SYSTEMS. AND REALLY LIKED THE CAPABILITIES AND THE CUSTOMER RATE BASE TO OPERATE A EFFECTIVELY. FOR THE STRUGGLING SYSTEMS CONSOLIDATION IS AN OPTION AND IT HAS BEEN EFFECTIVE IN SOME CASES BUT EVEN CONSOLIDATIONS BETWEEN WILLING AGENCIES. WITH WILLING PARTNERS CAN BE VERY DEATH THE DIFFICULT AND CHALLENGING ANTI A TIME CONSUMING TO UNDERTAKE. AB TWENTY FIFTIES UNIQUE IN THAT PROVIDES A VERY INNOVATIVE CONSOLIDATION TOOL WERE MULTIPLE CHRONICALLY FAILING SYSTEMS ARE SIMULTANEOUSLY DISSOLVED IN THEN REFORMED INTO NEW LARGER MORE TECHNICALLY AND FINANCIALLY COMPETENT AGENCIES WITH REDUCED OVERHEAD THROUGH ECONOMIES OF SCALE. SINCE THIS BILL IS REALLY. FOR US A TOP PRIORITY IN SAFE WATERS TRUCK PRIORITY THE BRILL UP PROVIDES A VERY STRICT TIMELINE AND STEP BY STEP PROCESS TO DISSOLVE THOSE FAILING SYSTEMS INTO CONDUCT THE PROCEEDINGS FOR FORMING THE NEW. COMPETENT WILL WATER AGENCIES IN A REASONABLE TIMEFRAME AND FINALLY TO ENSURES ACCOUNTABILITY THE BILL. BUILDS IN A POST FORMATION OVERSIGHT PROCESS WITH AN INDEPENDENT REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE ON THE START UP IN FINANCIAL HEALTH OF THOSE SYSTEMS. WE REALLY BELIEVE THAT THROUGH THIS BILL THERE'S GOING TO BE A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN THE OVERALL NUMBER OF THE SMALL FAILING SYSTEMS IN THAT THE NEWLY FORMED SMALL SYSTEM WATER AUTHORITIES WILL VERY OFFICIALLY DELIVER SAFE AND RELIABLE WATER. TO VERY MANY COMMUNITIES IN NEED AND IT'S FOR THESE RISKS REASONS THAT I RESPECTFULLY URGE YOUR AYE VOTE ON AB TWENTY FIFTY THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THE OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.

MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS STEVE BIG WITH THEIR REDUCES ITS FOR THE WATER FOUNDATION. THE WATER FOUNDATIONS DEDICATED TO MAKING SURE THE CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCESS TO CLEAN AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER AND THEY AGREE THE CONSOLIDATION COULD BE A TOOL TO HELP DO THAT. THEY LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE SPONSORS AND THE AUTHOR TO ADDRESS ANY POTENTIAL ISSUES THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. MADAM CHAIR EXCUSE ME I AM NOT IN OPPOSITION FOREIGN SUPPORT. SO WE DO NOT HAVE A POSITION YET BUT WOULD VERY MUCH APPRECIATE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE BRIEF COMMENTS. A PAMELA MILLER WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF LAUGHED GOES I WANT TO START BY THANKING THE AUTHOR AND HER STAFF. AND THE SPONSORS AND WORKING WITH US WE'VE BEEN IN CONVERSATION WITH THE SPONSORS SINCE EARLY DECEMBER. SO AND THIS IS A A VERY A BIG IDEA. AND WE HAVE A VERY STRONG INTEREST. IN THIS WE CERTAINLY SUPPORT THE INTENT. OF GETTING ALL CALIFORNIANS A SAFE INADEQUATE DRINKING WATER. AND SINCE LAUGH CHO SO INTRICATELY INVOLVED IN THIS OP PROPOSED PROCESS AND WE WE HAVE A HUGE INTEREST IN THIS AND WANTING TO MAKE SURE WE GET IT RIGHT. I GET IT RIGHT THE FIRST TIME. I WERE MAKING A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF PROGRESS AGAIN WE WE WANT TO THANK YOU FOR WORKING WITH US ON WHICH IS STILL HAVE A COUPLE OF THINGS AND I'M NOT GOING TO GO INTO DETAIL GIVEN THE LATE HOUR. BUT THEY THEY HAVE ARE OF VERY DETAILED FEEDBACK BUT. THE TIMING IN THE FLOW OF IN TERMS OF OF FORMATION AND DISSOLUTION OF IT IS STILL JUST A LITTLE BIT OFF OF IT SO WE ARE LIKE TO WORK WITH HIM ON THAT. A WITH RESPECT TO THE DISSOLUTION PROCESS WE AND MAYBE IT'S IN THERE AND WE'VE JUST ARE OVERLOOKED IT. WE DO SEE A REFERENCE AND A PROCESS FOR THE PUBLIC WATER SYSTEM TO BE DISSOLVED BUT NOT A PUBLIC AGENCY TO BE DISSOLVED BY THE LAUGH CHO. OH WE WANT TO WORK WITH THEM HONOR QUESTIONS ABOUT THE MODIFICATIONS. THAT THEY'LL LAUGH CHO HAS AUTHORITY TO APPROVE THE FORMATION BUT WITH MODIFICATIONS SO WE HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT PROCESS. WE HAVE SOME GOOD SOME CONCERNS ABOUT BY HAVING SOME OF THIS CODIFIED IN THE. C. K. H. IN THE ACT THAT GOVERNS LASCAUX. ON JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE VERY CLEAR AND COVERED THEIR. AND AS WELL AS THE THE FUNDING. WE MADE IT VERY CLEAR TO THE SPONSORS. VERY EARLY ON. ABOUT LAUGH CHO FUNDING IN THIS COMMITTEE HAS PROBABLY HEARD ME AD NAUSEUM ABOUT THAT. I AND SO WE WANT TO THANK YOU FOR MAKING SURE THAT THAT IS IN THERE WE DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE FULLY COVERED FROM THE BEGINNING. THROUGH ALL THAT VERY LAST ANNUAL REPORT AND PUBLIC HEARING THAT WE NEED TO HAVE. AND SO WE'VE OFFERED SOME OF SUMMER GENERIC KIND OF LANGUAGE TO AFOR CONSIDERATION AS OPPOSED TO THEM WERE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT A A DOLLAR AMOUNT NOT TO EXCEED. THIS IS AN EXTREMELY NEW PROCESS UNCHARTED TERRITORY WE DO NOT KNOW HOW MUCH THIS WILL COST. WE COULD GIVE SOME ESTIMATES BUT I THINK IT'S VERY DANGEROUS TO HAVEN'T NOT TO EXCEED DOLLAR AMOUNT SO. AND THOSE ARE JUST SOME OF OUR COMMENTS AND. WITH THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSOR HAVE AGREED TO CONTINUE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH US WE APPRECIATE. NEGATIVE. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS YES GOOD AFTERNOON DAVID WOLF I WITH THE HOWARD JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION OPPOSED TO AB TWENTY FIFTY BUT QUITE FRANKLY REGRETTABLE OPPOSE. MEMBERS WE DO RECOGNIZE WHAT'S IN THAT THERE ARE AT LEAST ONE MILLION PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA MAINLY IN RURAL AREAS MAINLY DEALING WITH THE SMALL DISTRICTS BUT DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO CLEAN WATER AND WE DO ABSOLUTELY FUNDAMENTALLY BELIEVE THIS IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM THAT NEEDS TO BE SOLVED. AND BY AND LARGE THIS IS A GOOD MEASURE TO DO IT. YOU KNOW I DO APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENT TAKEN BY THE AUTHOR TO FIX THE STAND BY CHARGES. THAT WAS HALF THE REASON WHY WE WERE OPPOSED TO THE BELL AND I APPRECIATE WORKING WITH RON DAVIS EIGHT EASTERN. T. TAKE CARE OF THAT SITUATION. WHICH AGAIN RESULTED IN YOU KNOW HALF OF OUR OPPOSITION BUT UNFORTUNATELY WE'RE STILL POSTCARDS ON PHILOSOPHICAL GROUNDS. WE DO BELIEVE THAT. YOU KNOW WHILE. WE BELIEVE BASICALLY THAT YOU KNOW ANYTIME YOU'RE GIVING YOU WITH STORIES BOND AUTHORITY THAT ANYTIME YOU'RE SHOWN LONG TERM DEBT THAT SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO A TWO THIRDS VOTE. YOU KNOW YOU'RE ASSURING THAT THE COULD LAST FAR BEYOND. THE ABILITY OF LOCAL FISH OFFICIALS HE PUT ON THE BALLOT TO KEEP IT IN PLACE. AND SO GETTING VOTER APPROVAL GETTING A SUPERMAJORITY THRESHOLD WE BELIEVE IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT IS PHILOSOPHICAL WE'VE HAD THE SAME POSITION FOR ANY NUMBER OF YEARS SAU UNFORTUNATELY WE MUST REMAIN OPPOSED BUT. YOU KNOW VERY ANXIOUS TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR TO TRY AND ADDRESS THIS BECAUSE LIKE I SAID IT'S A SERIOUS ISSUE. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN A PILE OF THAT OPPOSE. SING NONE ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE. YES ASSEMBLYMEMBER COOLEY. I JUST WANT TO JUMP IN AND OFFER A COMMENT ABOUT THIS BILL I. I CERTAINLY SEE THE VALUE OF IT. BUT I ACTUALLY FEEL I HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT HOW WELL IT'S DRAFTED. I'M AN AYE VOTE TODAY. BUT YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT FORTY PAGES OF NEW AD MATERIAL THAT I'VE KIND OF GONE THROUGH. THE THING I CHOOSE TO FOCUS ON IS IN THE FINANCING PROVISIONS. I'M READING THOSE PROVISIONS BACK ON PAGES THIRTY SEVEN THIRTY EIGHT THE BILL I CONSIDER AT THIS POINT VERY MUCH. A MODEL. VERY CONFUSING TO READ. WE ARE TALKING APPROVING DISTRICTS OF COURSE UNDER THE. UNDER THE CODE IMPROVEMENT DISTRICTS START WITH THE TWO THIRDS. SIGNING ON A PROPERTY OWNER SO THAT'S GOOD. WE'VE BEEN EXEMPTED FROM THE ELECTION PROVISIONS. IN THIS BILL. THE THE REVENUE BOND WE WE ACCEPT THE BONDS FROM ANY ELECTION PROVISION. AT THE SAME TIME THE ACTION OF. ESTABLISHED A SYSTEM IS REFERENDUM ALL. SO OKAY YOU'RE EXEMPT FROM THE ELECTION PROVISIONS BUT IT'S REFERENDA BOWL WHO'S GOING TO BE DOING THE VOTING. WE TALK ABOUT. I CAN'T SPEND THE MONEY ACCEPT ANY IMPROVEMENT DISTRICTS. BUT ALL THE SERVICE AREA INCLUDES ADJACENT AREAS. ADJACENT AREAS THAT ARE THERE AS OF THE DATE OF THE ELECTION. DOES NOT APPLY. SO I JUST FEEL THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME CARE LOOKING AT THOSE PROTECTING PROVISIONS OF THE BILL. PA. AND. SO I AM ACTUALLY TALKING TO SEVENTY EIGHT ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY EIGHT ONE OH TO. READ IT CAREFULLY AND JUST THINK ABOUT WHAT ARE THE MECHANICS OF ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT. AND IS IT CLEAR. BECAUSE I CAN'T TELL FROM THIS WHAT AREAS ARE GETTING THE BENEFIT WHO'S VOTING. IS THAT THE PEOPLE WITHIN THE IMPROVEMENT DISTRICT AS AT THE PARCEL TO JASON THE SHORTER EXTENDED SERVICE IN TWO. IT'S JUST A VERY MODEL PROVISION OF LAW AND IT'S YOUR. FINANCIAL PROVISIONS. S. WHAT THE FINANCIAL PROVISIONS ARE THAT CONFUSED. AND CONCEPTS ARE APPEARING AND DISAPPEARING HAS EXPLAINS HOW IT WORKS IT'S JUST VERY CONCERNING TO ME SO I'M JUST I'M AN AYE VOTE TODAY. ARE BUT I. I NEED TO SEE IMPROVEMENT. AND I JUST ATTENTION TO DETAIL I DO UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU TRY TO CRAFT SOMETHING NEW. THAT SHOULD DO THE BEST YOU CAN. AND I RESPECT THAT THIS IS A A WHAT THAT SORT OF EFFORT. BUT I'M JUST SEEM WHEN I SIT DOWN TO READ IT THERE'S THINGS THAT ARE. INCOMPREHENSIBLE. AND. ONCE IN THE FINANCIAL VISION PROTECT FOR THAT SORT OF CONCERNING. I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS REFERENCE BRIGHT APPLIES WHO HAS THE. RIGHT TO VOTE. WHAT'S THE ELECTION THE TAXES AREA TO THE IMPROVEMENT DISTRICT WHEN THERE ISN'T ELECTIONS HOLE. THANK YOU. ARE THERE OTHER COMMENTS. OKAY I DO HAVE A A MOTION AND A SECOND WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. MEMBERS I THINK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND. ABSOLUTE WILL REVIEW THAT. ASSEMBLYMEMBER COOLEY APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR. YOUR ATTENTION TO DETAIL ON THE BOTTOM LINE IS SERVING CONTAMINATED WATER. TO. RESIDENCES REALLY UNACCEPTABLE IN THIS IS ONE OF THE STRATEGIES. THAT WE THINK WE COULD MAKE A TREMENDOUS DIFFERENCE IN RURAL CALIFORNIA SO WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE. OKAY. I THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THE BILL FORWARD I'M WE STRUGGLE IN MY COMMUNITIES. GET MAKING SURE OF SAFE GOOD QUALITY WATER. AND THIS IS GIVING US ANOTHER TOOL TO DO THAT. BUT I WILL SAY IS THAT I DO HAVE CONCERNS THAT. MISTER COOLEY BROUGHT UP SOME I I'M CONFIDENT HE'LL WORK ON THOSE. BUT I DO WANT TO SHARE THE CAL OFF GOES A CONCERNS ABOUT FUNDING ARE REALLY PRETTY HIGH PRIORITY AS WELL. I'VE BEEN ON THE CAL OFF GO BUT THEN THE LEFT ABOARD FEEL COUNTY BEFORE. A FUNDING HAS ALWAYS BEEN A KIND OF AN ISSUE THE PEOPLE FORGET ABOUT THEM. AND SO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT YOU CAN CONTINUE WORKING ON NEGOTIATIONS WITH CAL LEFT THOUGH. AND MAKE SURE THEY'RE AT THE TABLE I'M ALSO I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THIS BILL TOTALLY I LOVE THIS BILL I THINK IT'S GOING TO HELP A LOT OF OUR RURAL COMMUNITIES. AND WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO SPREAD THE COST. FOR A SEVEN MILLION DOLLAR PROJECT ON TWELVE HUNDRED. HOOKUPS IT JUST DOESN'T PENINSULA. AND SO WHATEVER WE CAN DO TO HELP OUR COMMUNITIES I'M ALL AND STUFF THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD THINKING. US SECRETARY CALL THE ROLL THE MOTION IS TO PASS AND REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS ADWARE CURRY. AYE WHERE CURRY AYE WALDRON BLOOM. BLOOM I COME THE AERO COMEY EURO AYE COOLEY. COOLEY AYE GRAYSON. GRAYSON AYE LACKEY. LACKEY NOT VOTING STONE. VOEPEL. BILLS OUT FIVE ZERO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. RIGHT WE ARE UP ON A A. B. THIRTY ONE FORTY SEVEN. AND WE'LL GET HER STUFF AND EVERYONE APPEAR. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS. CALIFORNIA IS IS IN THE DEPTHS OF A HOUSING CRISIS MARKED BY A SEVERE LACK OF HOMES AND APARTMENTS AFFORDABLE TO VERY LOW LOW AND MODERATE INCOME FAMILIES. THERE IS MUCH TO DO TO EXPEDITE THE PROCESS OF BUILDING HOMES AND TO MAKE IT LESS EXPENSIVE TO BUILD. ONE OF THE BIGGEST BARRIERS TO INCREASING SUPPLY AND AFFORDABILITY IS THE IMPOSITION OF EXCESSIVE. EXCESSIVE IMPACT AND DEVELOPER FEES THAT WERE NOT REQUIRED BY THE CITY OR COUNTY IN INITIAL COMMUNICATIONS AND THAT ADD SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE OVERALL COST OF THE PROPOSED HOUSING UNITS. THAT'S WHY I AM PROUD TO PRESENT A. B. THIRTY ONE FORTY SEVEN TODAY WHICH WOULD PROHIBIT CITIES AND COUNTIES FROM CHARGING OR ADDING NEW IMPACT AND DEVELOPMENT FEES. TO APPLICANTS FOR HOUSING PROJECTS ONCE AN APPLICATION IS DEEMED SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE BY THE JURISDICTION. THESE NEW IMPACT OR DEVELOPMENT. FEES ARE USUALLY REQUIRED AS A CONDITION FOR APPROVAL OF ANY PROJECT AND THE DEVELOPER HAS NO RECOURSE BUT TO AGREE TO THEM IF THEY WANT THE PROJECT APPROVED. HOWEVER ALL TOO OFTEN THE FEES ARE REVEALED LATE IN THE PROCESS WHILE AFTER A DEVELOPER HAS BUDGETED FOR THE PROJECT AND IT STARTED TO SPEND MONEY ON PROPERTY ACQUISITION THE PROFESSIONALS BASED ON PUBLIC FEE SCHEDULES. I'VE SPOKEN TO MANY STAKEHOLDERS STAFF AND MEMBERS ON THIS ISSUE WHILE WE MAY NOT ALL AGREE ON THE SOLUTION ONE THING REMAINS CLEAR THERE IS A PROBLEM. IN FACT ACCORDING TO A RECENT UC BERKELEY TURNER CENTER FOR HOUSING AND INNOVATION STUDY. CERTAINTY FOR DEVELOPER FEES IS A SIMPLE POLICY CHANGE. THAT POLICY MAKERS AT ALL LEVELS WORKING TO ADDRESS THE HOUSING SHORTAGE SHOULD BEGIN WITH. IT IS BECOME INCREASINGLY MORE DIFFICULT. AS A BUILDER TO BUDGET A PROJECT THAT I'VE MISSED THE UNCERTAINTY AS TO WHAT FEES EXACTIONS A REQUIREMENTS COULD COME INTO PLAY AT ANY STAGE OF THE PROCESS. WHEN DEVELOPMENT FEELS FEES ARE NOT REVEALED NOT READILY ACCESSIBLE REASONABLE AND PREDICTABLE IT IS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT. A PLAN BUDGET AND BUILD WHICH ONLY EXACERBATES CALIFORNIA'S HOW'D HOUSING SHORTAGE. I APPRECIATE THE WORK OF LOCAL OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT COMMITTEE STAFF AND THE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE BEING SUGGESTED BY THE COMMITTEE. HOWEVER I CANNOT ACCEPT ALL OF THE AMENDMENTS AS PROPOSED IN THE ANALYSIS. THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS SUGGESTS REQUIRING CITIES AND COUNTIES TO PUBLISH A FEE SCHEDULE ON THE WEBSITE. NOT ONLY IS THIS COSTLY BUT THERE IS NO WAY TO ENFORCE THIS PROVISION AND FRANKLY I'M NOT WILLING TO IMPOSE REQUIREMENTS WITHOUT ENFORCEMENT ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM IN HOUSING. ARENA. AYE I'VE DONE THAT BEFORE AND IT DOESN'T WORK THE PROPOSED COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS ALSO SUGGESTS FREEZING IMPACT IN DEVELOPMENT FEES AT THE POINT THAT A PROJECT IS ENTITLED. INSTEAD OF WHEN THE APP APPLICATION IS APPROVED. FREEZING THE FEES AT THE POINT UP ENTITLEMENT DOESN'T WORK PROJECTS CAN BE IN THE ENTITLEMENT PROCESS. FOR YEARS ALL THE WHILE FEES CAN BE ADDED IN PROJECTS DON'T PENCIL OUT. AB THIRTY ONE FORTY SEVEN PASSED OUT OF THE HOUSING ASSEMBLY HOUSING COMMITTEE THIS MORNING ON A SEVEN TO ZERO VOTE. I WORKED WITH THE WITH THE CHAIR. AND WE NEGOTIATED A NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS. AND I IT IF THIS BILL PASSES OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE TODAY I WILL TAKE THEM IN THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE THEY'VE ALREADY BEEN OUT WRITTEN UP THEY WERE. READY AT QUITE SOME TIME AGO THEY DEFINE IMPACT IN DEVELOPMENT FEES AS DRAFTED IN NINE BE OF THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS WHICH STATES THAT THESE THOSE FEES THAT ARE ESTABLISHED BY THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT. SEPARATE FROM ITS ACTION ON A SPECIFIC APPLICATION AND ARE LIMITED TO FEES IMPOSED UNDER THE FEE MEDICATION ACT IT'S IN THAT IT'S IN OUR. OUR ANALYSIS. IT THEY THAT FREES THE FEES WHEN THE APPLICATION IS SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE BUT ADD THREE OFF RAMPS THAT PROVIDE RELIEF FROM THESE REQUIREMENTS IN RESPONSE TO THE SEQUENCE ANALYSIS. IN RESPONSE TO HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE ISSUES AND INFLATION COST ESCALATORS. AND THREE THEY FREEZE THE FEES FOR UP TO TWO YEARS INSTEAD OF THE FIVE THAT WAS ORIGINALLY IN IN IN OUR PROPOSAL. CHAIR AND MEMBERS THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE AND ONE WE CANNOT IGNORE. I'M COMMITTED TO WORKING ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE WITH STAKEHOLDERS IN THE COMMITTEE AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY. WITH ME IN SUPPORT IS ALYSSA STINSON FROM THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION AND MARINO WE AT FROM THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING CONSORTIUM. SO JUST JUST LIKE FOREVER FOREGO FOR THE FOR THE COMMITTEE TODAY WERE JUST DOING AS THE BILL THAT IS WRITTEN UNDERSTAND AND WE'RE TAKING AMENDMENTS TO TAKE THOSE WHATEVER THEY ARE OVER IN APPROPRIATIONS CORRECT OKAY. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS ASSISTANCE AND ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY THE SPONSORS OF EIGHTY THIRTY ONE FORTY SEVEN. IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I WOULD LIKE TO KEEP MY COMMENTS BRIEF AND SECOND WHAT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER. HAS SO EXPERTLY STATED ABOUT THE NEED FOR THIS BILL BUT ALSO LIKE KILEY BEGAN THE NATURE OF THE HOUSING CRISIS AND HOW THIS BILL WOULD TAKE A STEP IN ADDRESSING THAT. WE'RE ALL WELL AWARE OF JUST HOW DIRE THIS HOUSING CRISIS HAS BEEN SINCE THE BOTTOM OF THE GREAT RECESSION IN TWO THOUSAND NINE THIS IS BEEN THE SLOWEST RECOVERY IN HISTORY AND WE ARE STILL NOWHERE NEAR. A HEALTHY HOUSING MARKET EVERYDAY WE SEE CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING AFFORDABILITY WORSE AND WHILE THERE IS NO SILVER BULLET WE CAN TAKE MEANINGFUL STEPS TO ASSURE TO ENSURING TRANSPARENCY IN CONTAINING COSTS. THIS BILL IS ONE OF THOSE MEANINGFUL STEPS BY SEEKING TO PROVIDE CERTAINTY AROUND THE CONSTANTLY CHANGING FEES THAT ARE LEVIED ON HOUSING PROJECTS. WHILE WE HAVE GROWN ACCUSTOMED TO PAYING THESE IMPACT FEES AS A CONDITION OF APPROVAL. THERE IS ALSO A GROWING CONCERN THAT THESE EXACTIONS ARE REVEALED LATE IN THE PROCESS CAUSING PROJECTS TO BE RECONSIDERED AND DRIVING UP THE COST ON FUTURE HOME BUYERS. CREATING THE SURETIES AROUND THE FEES INVOLVING INVOLVED IN A HOUSING DEVELOPMENT ALLOWS US TO PROVIDE HOUSING AT ALL AND LEVELS THAT CITIZENS CAN ACTUALLY AFFORD. EACH LATE HEAD CANNOT THOUSANDS TOOK THE COSTS AND IN CALIFORNIA EVERY TIME THERE'S AN INCREASE IN THE COST OF A HOME BY A THOUSAND DOLLARS IF PRICES ARE OVER FIFTEEN THOUSAND FAMILIES. AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MENTIONED THE UC BERKELEY TURNER CENTERS FOR AFFORDABLE OR FOR HOUSING FICTION RELEASED A STUDY LAST MONTH. REGARDING THE OVERALL COST OF HOUSING DEVELOPMENT FEES BY DOING A CASE STUDY OF SEVEN CALIFORNIA CITIES. AMONG THEIR MAIN FINDINGS THEY SUGGESTED THAT CALIFORNIA ADOPTED FEE TRANSPARENCY POLICY AND IMPLEMENT BEST PRACTICES FOR CITING IN CHARGING FEES AND TO DEFINE WHEN THE FEES CAN BE LEVIED AND CHARGE DURING THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS. I WOULD AGAIN LIKE TO THINK THE AUTHOR FOR HER LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE I HAVE CBA GENERAL COUNSEL NICK CAMMARATA HERE FOR. WITH ME FOR ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS WE ARE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT WE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS MARINO MIGHT WITH THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING CONSORTIUM PLEASED TO SUPPORT THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE AS YOU ARE ALL WELL AWARE. IT'S VERY CHALLENGING FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS TO BUILD THE STATE BECAUSE OF THE MANY DIFFERENT LAYERS THE FINANCING THAT THEY'RE REQUIRED TO PUT TOGETHER ANY OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE MORE CERTAINTY IN THE PROCESS. AND THE COST IS ABOUT MAKE THAT MUCH EASIER FOR THEM TO DO THEIR DEVELOPMENT AND SO WE URGE YOUR I'VE OF TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. SO AS A MATTER NOT LIKE HAS PUBLIC AFFAIRS HERE ON BEHALF OF HABITAT FOR HUMANITY CALIFORNIA'S WALLS CALIFORNIA UNION SUPPORT. MADISON Y. ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN SUPPORT. AND RIGHTLY HERE ON BEHALF OF CAL CHAMBER ALSO IN SUPPORT. JOHN LEWIS OF THE NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT BUSINESS REPRESENTING OVER TWENTY THOUSAND SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS IN SUPPORT. ANY OTHERS IN SUPPORT SAYING NONE ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. ONE UP MY HAVE SWITCHED SEATS UP HERE. HELLO GOOD EVENING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS JASON RILEY CALIFORNIA CITIES. AND VIRTUALLY YES WE HAVE TO A OPPOSE THIS MEASURE I THINK EITHER A COUPLE. A COUPLE OF. REALLY BIG ISSUES HERE THAT WHEN IT COMES AND THE FEES ARE ALL TALK ABOUT MITIGATION FEE ACT. ON WHAT WE ARE HIGHLY REGULATED HOW WE CAN CHARGE FEES ON THOSE FEES ITO DO VARY FROM COMMUNITY TO COMMUNITY. BASED ON A WHOLE HOST OF REASONS I'M BUT THE ONE THING I THINK TO MAKE VERY VERY CLEAR IS THAT. THESE FEES ARE LAWFUL AND THESE FEES ARE SUBJECT TO NOT ONLY MITIGATION FEE ACT BUT ALSO SUBJECT TO THE CONSTITUTION. AND THESE FEES ARE OF TO PROVIDE SERVICES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT TO PAY FOR THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE DEVELOPMENT TO PAY FOR THE PARKS THE LIBRARIES THE POLICE SERVICE. EVERYTHING THAT'S NEEDED FOR THIS DEVELOPMENT HAS TO COME OUT OF THESE. FUNDS FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS AND MOST NOTABLY PROP THIRTEEN AND WE CANNOT SPREAD THE COST OF OF THIS DEVELOPMENT ON TO PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT GOING TO BENEFIT FROM THIS DEVELOPMENT SO. THAT'S WHY THAT THE FEES ARE WHAT THEY ARE I'M IN IT IT IS A IT IS A REAL STRUGGLE SO I I CERTAINLY SYMPATHIZE WITH WITH THE DEVELOPERS. ONE THING TO MAKE CLEAR IS THAT WE'RE NOT HERE TO PLAY A GAME OF GOTCHA WITH THE DEVELOPERS AND WE CERTAINLY WANT TO TELL THEM WHAT THE FEES ARE. SOME OF THESE FEES WE DO NOT KNOW AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF THE PROCESS SO MAKES IT DIFFICULT THEN TO A DETERMINE WHAT THOSE FEES ARE ACTUALLY GONNA BE. SO I MEAN IF IT'S ABOUT TELLING DEVELOPER EXACTLY WHAT THEY NEED TO DO IN ORDER TO ADD IN A DEVELOPING GREAT WE CERTAINLY CAN DO THAT. I'M BUT TO FREEZE THESE FEES AND OUR MINDS AT LEAST ESSENTIALLY REWARDS ARE DEVELOPERS DEVELOPING APPROVED PROJECTS WE DON'T BUILD THE HOMES THE DEVELOPERS BUILD HOMES SO IF WE'RE GOING TO ALLOW THEM TO TO NOT DEVELOP FOR YEARS IN FREEZE THOSE FEES. WHILE THE COST OF PROVIDING THAT INS AND INFRASTRUCTURE CONTINUES TO ESCALATE SEEM COUNTERPRODUCTIVE IN FOR THAT WE HAVE TO POST. CITY JOYS OF SENDING AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION I'M AND WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH AUTHORS OFFICE IN THE SPONSORS AND WE APPRECIATE THAT. I WON IT THERE WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE AMENDMENT SO WERE AT A DISADVANTAGE HERE AND I THINK THAT'S PART OF OUR CONCERN. BUT THERE'S TWO ISSUES THAT ACTUALLY WERE BROUGHT UP AND ONE IS THAT THE FEES WOULD BE LOCKED IN. AYE OUT SUBSTANTIAL COMPLETENESS. THAT'S A BRAND NEW TERM WOULD UNDERSTAND WHY THAT WOULD BE PART OF THE DISCUSSION IT'S EITHER COMPLETE OR IT'S NOT WE WOULD DEFINITELY NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE ANY INFORMATION ABOUT FEES WHEN WE DON'T HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION WE HAVE MADE THAT DETERMINATION THAT'S. COMPLETE. THAT'S A MAJOR PROBLEM FOR US BECAUSE WE DON'T NOT WANT NEW TERMS AND REQUIREMENTS IN THE MIDDLE OF A PROCESS HAS BEEN. THE SECOND IS THAT. I THINK AS AS A LEAGUE NOTED. WE WON'T KNOW THE EXACT. PROJECT INTEL IT'S AT THE ENTITLED STAGE ONES AT ENTITLEMENT THEM WE KNOW HOW MANY SQUARE FEET IS HOW MANY UNITS THERE'S GOING TO BE ALL THE OTHER THINGS THAT WE BASE OUR FEES ON. WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO GIVE AN ESTIMATE. AT THE TIME OF THE COMPLETE APPLICATION. BECAUSE WE DO STE DO A SCHEDULE OF FEES WE KNOW WHAT THEY ARE WHAT KIND OF UNITS WOULD APPLY. AND THEY WOULD APPLY TO AND HOW THEIR. ASSESS WHETHER IT'S BY UNIT BY SQUARE FOOTAGE BY OF OTHER IMPACTS. BUT IF THE PROJECT IS IS CHANGED ASIDE FROM SECA. IF IT'S CHANGED OVER THAT PERIOD OF TIME WHETHER IT'S. FORWARD DESIGN REVIEW OR ANYTHING ELSE IS A GOES TO THE PROJECT. WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THE CHANGES OF YOUR IDENTIFYING THE APPROPRIATE IMPACT AND THE APPROPRIATE IMPACT FEES THEY MAY GO UP OR DOWN. BUT IN ANY EVENT WE DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION AT THE TIME OF A COMPLETE APPLICATION. BUT WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO GIVE AN ESTIMATE THERE. I THINK YOU'RE OTHERS THAT WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. CHRISLEY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES IN OPPOSITION. TO ONE OF OUR SOME HAVE URBAN CARRIES A CALIFORNIA ALSO HERE ON BEHALF OF THE RURAL COUNTIES ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESS ISN'T THAT OPPOSE. SING NONE ARE QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE. ASSEMBLYMEMBER GRAYSON. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I JUST A COUPLE THINGS REAL QUICK AND WITH ALL DUE RESPECT. TO. SOME TESTIMONY BY OPPOSITION. SPEAKING AS A GENERAL CONTRACTOR. WITH THAT STONE ACTIVE LICENSE. AS WELL AS A MAYOR OF A CITY COUNCIL MEMBER CITY SOMEONE THAT'S BEEN THROUGH THE PLANNING PROCESS AS WELL AS POINT PERMITS. SUBSTANTIAL COMPLETE A SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE APPLICATION IS NOT A NEW TERM. BUT IS A TERM THAT'S BEEN USED LEAST TEN. JURISDICTION I HAVE BOTH HAD TO PULL A PERMIT AND AS WELL AS SERVING AND. AS ELECTED OFFICIAL HAS BEEN USED UP CONSIDERABLY. AND SO HAVING NOT HAVING SAID THAT. APPLICATIONS DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE COMPLETE OR NOT COMPLETE THERE IS A STAGE WHERE THEY REACH SUBSTANTIAL. COMPLETION OF A NAP OF FOUR FOUR PERMIT OR FOR A DEVELOPMENT. AND I DO HAVE A QUESTION AND NOT SURE FROM WHAT SOURCES GOING TO COME FROM. HOWEVER I THINK I MIGHT KNOW THE ANSWER IN MY HEAD BUT THERE IS A TIME LIMIT. FOR WHICH A CITY MUST REVIEW. APPLICATIONS FOR DEVELOPMENT IS THAT THE CASE. WE HAVE THE PERMIT STREAMLINED ACT APPLIES AND THEN YOU HAVE YOU KNOW VESTED TENET AMOUNTS INTO MEMPHIS ALL SORTS OF TIMELINES AND. AND YOU KNOW YOU. RIGHT SO THAT THAT TIME. TABLE IS THERE SO I UNDERSTAND THE CITIES HAVE TO CONFORM TO THAT TIME TABLE. HERE'S WHERE THE STRUGGLE HAPPENS IS WHEN A DEVELOPER COMES THEY MEET THE DESIGN REVIEW BOARD. THEN ONCE THEY PASSED THAT DESIGN REVIEW BOARD BECAUSE THEY'RE BEING PUSHED BY THE TIME LIMIT. THEN THEY GET INTO THE PLANNING COMMISSION STAGE ONCE WE GET INTO THE PLANNING COMMISSION STAGE. PLANNING COMMISSIONERS OF OR STAFF RECOMMENDING TO PLANNING COMMISSIONERS MAY END UP SENDING THAT PROJECT. BACK TO THE DESIGN REVIEW WELL IN ORDER TO GET THE PLANNING STAGE IN HAVING GONE THAT FAR THERE'S ALREADY BEEN A PERFORMER THAT IS DONE. PROJECTS HAVE ALREADY BEEN PRICED OUT BY THE TIME WE GET SENT BACK TO DESIGN REVIEW TO MAKE CHANGES THE DESIGN REVIEW OR TAKES THE LIBERTY AT THAT POINT TO GO EVEN FURTHER. OR TAKE AWAY TO THE POINT THAT IT DOES IMPACT THE COST OF A JOB OR A PROJECT I I'VE RARELY EVER SEEN IT GO DOWN. EVER. IS IN MY IN MY KNOWLEDGE. BUT I HAVE SEEN IT MULTIPLE TIMES INCREASE. I EVEN TO THE POINT AND I WILL TELL YOU THIS AS A. AS A MEMBER ON THE COUNCIL THAT. PROBABLY ONE OF THE NUMBER ONE ISSUES THAT I FACED A COMPLAINTS. WAS. GOING THROUGH AND I THOUGHT I FELT LIKE WE HAD A PRETTY DECENT. PROCESS BUT EVEN THEN IT WAS GOING THROUGH THAT PLANNING PROCESS AND HITTING THOSE BOMBS AND THEN ADDITIONAL COST COMING AFTER A SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE APPLICATION. SO I WOULD I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE ATTEMPT THAT THIS BILL IS TRYING TO MAKE ALONG WITH YOUR. WITH YOUR WORK ABILITY WITH OPPOSITION TRY TO COME UP WITH SOME TYPE OF A A COMPROMISE AND I BELIEVE YOU'RE ACCEPTING AMENDMENTS I KNOW THEY'RE BRAND NEW. SO SOME HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO SEE IT. SO IF I COULD IF I COULD DAM. RESPOND TO THAT PART OF THE CHALLENGE WAS THE. THE EXPEDITED. DOUBLE REFERRAL SYSTEM PRODUCT UP FRANKLY. MANY OF THE AMENDMENTS WERE EXACTLY THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE REQUESTED. BOTH BY THE APA AND BY THE LEAGUE OF CITIES AND SO MY MY APOLOGIES IT IN IN TERMS OF THIS PROCESS BUT. WHAT'S HAPPENED IS THAT. IS THAT SPECIFICALLY IN THESE AMENDMENTS ARE THINGS THAT THEY SUGGESTED THAT WE WORK ON THAT WORK THE JOB ISN'T DONE YET. WE WANT TO CONTINUE WORKING ON IT BUT. THERE'S WE HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO QUIBBLE WITH THE MITIGATION ACT AND HOW THAT OPERATES THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO. AMELIORATE AGAINST WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO MILLION RATE AGAINST ARE THOSE. THOSE INSTANCES WHERE I MEET SOMEBODY MENTIONED TODAY FOR EXAMPLE A FIRE STATION IS NEEDED. YOU PLAN FOR THAT WHEN YOU START. YOU KNOW ADDING ADDITIONAL RESIDENCES THAT'S ALREADY IN GENERAL PLANS AND SPECIFIC PLANTS AND SO. SO TO NOT HAVE TOLD SOMEBODY UP FRONT THAT THEY WERE GOING TO HAVE TO PAY INTO IT MEANS THAT THEY DIDN'T DO THE WORK. NECESSARILY TO BE ABLE TO GET THAT FEE IN PLACE AND SO TO STICK IT ON AT THE END REALLY BLOWS THE BUDGETS BUT NOT SO ANYWAY THAT YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THERE MOST OF THESE AMENDMENTS ARE IN RESPONSE TO THINGS THAT WE HEARD. AS DEAD AS THE BILL WAS WAS WAITING IN THE FIRST COMMITTEE AND IF I UNDERSTAND. ASSEMBLY MEMBER CARILLO THAT. THERE WAS ONE AMENDMENT THAT YOU WERE SAYING. WOULD NOT. CONSIDERING THAT WAS THE ONE ABOUT THE WEBSITE AND PUTTING THE FEES UP THERE JUST JUST TO STATE. THAT I AUTHORED A BILL LAST YEAR THAT WAS IN THE PACKAGE OF HOUSING. AB EIGHT SEVENTY NINE THAT CALLS FOR A STUDY. FROM THE HOUSING AND. REQUIRES THAT THERE BE RECOMMENDATIONS AND ACTIONS TO BE TAKEN ON THE REASON ABILITY OF OF FEES AND SO POSSIBLY THIS AMENDMENT WOULD FIT BETTER IN ANOTHER HOUSING BILL THAT WOULD COME FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD. WHEN THAT ACTUALLY HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED AND AND STUDIED OUT SO I APPRECIATE THAT. AS AROUND AS WELL AND UNDERSTAND THAT THERE MAY BE SOME STRIFE BETWEEN THE BILL YOU HAVE VERSES. THE WHAT THE COMMITTEES ARE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH AND HOPEFULLY THAT CAN GET WORKED OUT AS WELL. A ONE OF THE THINGS A REAL QUICK AND THE STATE WAS TALKED ABOUT AS FAR AS THE FAIRNESS OF THE FEES AND THE WAY CITIES. THEM HERE'S A RESULT OF OF OUR PROP THIRTEEN AND THAT WAS THE ONLY FOR CITIES TO RECOVER FROM THAT WAS TO INSTITUTE FEES. RATHER THAN TAXES AND. I CAN GIVE YOU ANTIDOTE OF OF IT OUGHT NOT ALWAYS BEING FAIR BUT CITIES TAKEN ADVANTAGE. OF A PROJECT TO. CREATE REVENUE WILL RAISE REVENUE WHEN IT REALLY WASN'T NECESSARY. ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY APPROVAL PROJECT. OF OVER THIRTY FIVE SQUARE FEET. IN WHICH. THE INFRASTRUCTURE HAD ALREADY BEEN IMPROVED AT. THE COST OF THE DEVELOPER. AND YET THEY STILL CHARGED ó SAID FEES. FOR THAT SAME INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WAS ALREADY IMPROVED. ONLY BECAUSE THEY COULD EVEN IN THE APPEALS PROCESS SO. THERE THERE ARE. THERE IS GREAT LIFT LEGITIMACY TO THIS BILL AND I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT. TODAY MOVE FORWARD AND SEE YOU TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH IT AND THEN WE RE VISITED ON THE FLOOR IF IT REACHES THAT FAR. AS TO WHETHER OR NOT YOU ABLE TO GET TO A PLACE WHERE IT'S PALATABLE OF FOR ALL PARTIES. SO WITH THAT I WOULD MOVE THE BILL. IT REMAINS. GOOD. HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND. WHICH I TO CLOSE. I THINK YOU FOR THE DISCUSSION AND IT'S BEEN VERY FEW FRUITFUL I APPRECIATED AND AND MY GOAL IS TO CONTINUE WORKING MOVE WHAT WE WANT THIS TO WORK. WE WORKED VERY HARD WITH THE. THE CHAIR OF HOUSING AND AND I THINK THAT'S A REASON IT WAS A SEVEN ZERO. YEAH VOTE OUT OF THE HOUSE TODAY. AND. I APPRECIATE THE YEAR WORKING ON THE BILL I'M GONNA PURSUE LAYOFF THE BILL TODAY BECAUSE I WANTED TO SEE THE AMENDMENTS IN THEY'VE CHANGE FROM. WHAT I HEARD IN HOUSING AND WATCH IT TODAY AND I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE I'M CLEAR ON THE I RT JUST TO BE VERY CLEAR IF IT THAT YOUR STAFF HAS HAD THE AMENDMENTS? FOR SINCE LAST WEEK AND THEY WERE IT IT'S TRUE IT WAS A PIECE OF THIS AND A PIECE OF THAT. IT IN HOUSING BUT.

THE SAN DIEGO REGIONAL AIRPORT THIRTY WAS CREATED BY STATE LEGISLATION IS THE INDEPENDENCE HAN AMISS ENTITY TO MANAGE THE AIRPORT OVERSEE LAND USE PLANNING FOR THE AIRPORT THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY AND INVESTIGATE. POTENTIAL MOVE TO OF THE LOCATION OF THE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT. AFTER FAIL APPEAL BALLOT MEASURE IN TWO THOUSAND SIX IT BECAME CLEAR THAT THE AIRPORT WOULD REMAIN WHERE IT IS HOWEVER SINCE THEN THE PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT BETWEEN THE AIRPORT OTHER AGENCY HAS LACKED COORDINATION LEADING TO PROBLEMS FOR THE COMMUNITY. THESE ARE PROBLEMS THAT DEAL WITH CONGESTION PUBLIC TRANSIT AND THE ENVIRONMENT. TRY TO GET THROUGH THIS IT'S PAST. WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE? IS CREATE UNDER THE AIRPORT AUTHORITY BUT THE REFEREE WILL CREATE. A COMMITTEE UNDER THE AIRPORT'S RD WITH REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE AIRPORT THE PORT. DISTRICT THE SITTING COUNTY SAN DIEGO AND THREE TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES THE COMMITTEE WOULD HAVE ONE YEAR TO CLAP. COLLABORATIVELY CREATE A PLAN REPORT BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE SINCE THIS WAS CREATED LEGISLATURE ON HOW TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES INCLUDING ROAD CONGESTION UNMET TRANSIT NEEDS AND ACCESS TO PUBLIC TRANSIT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS SUCH AS SEA LEVEL RISE. WITH ME TODAY WE HAVE ON AND AFTER A NUMBER OF STAKEHOLDER MEETING THINKING WE HAVE NO OPPOSITION WE HAVE SUPPORT OF BOTH THE PORT AND THE AIRPORT. WELCOME. A GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M ROUGHLY ACROSS THE ANALYSTS I AM THE CHAIR OF THE BOARD POOR COMMISSIONERS OF THE PORT OF SAN DIEGO. ON BEHALF OF THE PORT I AM HERE IN SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTY ONE NINETEEN THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR. IN NINETEEN SIXTY TWO THE SAN DIEGO BAY WATERFRONT CITIES CONTRIBUTED THEIR WATERFRONT LAND TO THE STATE'S NEWLY CREATED. PORT OF SAN DIEGO TO AVOID PROBLEMS CREATED BY LACK OF COORDINATION AND COMPETING INTERESTS. THE LEGISLATURE'S FORESIGHT HAS BEEN REWARDED WITH BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE AND PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT. WE JUST TURN THE PORT OF SAN DIEGO INTO A MAJOR PART OF THE NATION'S TRANSPORTATION AND GOODS MOVEMENT NETWORK WHICH CONTRIBUTES OVER EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR OF ECONOMIC IMPACT. AND HAS CREATED OVER SIXTY EIGHT THOUSAND JOBS. THE SAN DIEGO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ASSETS. ON THIS STATE LAND. TOGETHER WE ARE PROJECTING MILLIONS OF ADDITIONAL AIRLINE PASSENGERS THREE BILLION DOLLARS A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT ON THE WATERFRONT. HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF ADDITIONAL CRUISE PASSENGERS OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS. COLLABORATION IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER IN THIS IS WHAT WE NEED. THIS BILL. RECENT TRAFFIC STUDY SEEN BY THE PORT THE AIRPORT THE CITY AND THE COUNTY CHAU. GRIDLOCK. IF WE DO NOT ENGAGE IN TRANSIT PLANNING AND PROPER IMPLEMENTATION TO REDUCE VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED. A KEY STRATEGY IDENTIFIED BY THE STATE'S GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION GOALS. CURRENTLY PUBLIC TRANSIT OPTIONS TO THE AIRPORT ARE EXTREMELY LIMITED WITHOUT ANY EASY OPTION FOR LIGHT RAIL. AS IS THE CASE IN MANY METROPOLITAN AREAS. AND SEA LEVEL RISE THREATENS THE LONG TERM VIABILITY OF THE AIRPORT. THOSE IMPACTS INCLUDING FLOODING AND STORM SURGE MUST BE PLANNED FOR IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATE REQUIREMENTS. IT'S NOT JUST A GOOD IDEA IT'S THE LAW. WE NEED TO FIND SOLUTIONS RIGHT NOW THAT WILL ENSURE ACTION. AND ACCOUNTABILITY IN THE RESPONSIBILITY TO MANAGE THESE ISSUES. SO THE FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS IS TO HAVE A REGIONAL CONVERSATION AND CREATION OF NOT EXECUTED WILL PLAN AND THIS BILL WILL ALLOW THIS. IT WILL ENSURE THAT THE STATE EFFECTIVELY ADDRESSES MATTERS. OF STATEWIDE CONCERN WHILE MAKING SURE THAT LOCAL IMPACTS ARE ADDRESSED. THE PORT OF SAN DIEGO IS ALREADY ENGAGED IN ADDRESSING THESE TYPES THE PRIORITIES AND IS PREPARED TO DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO HELP IN THIS PROCESS.

IF PASSED BY VOTERS THE SALES TAX THE SALES AND TAX INCREASE WILL INCREASE NO MORE THAN FIVE POINT FIVE PERCENT. TO ADULT A TOTAL OF NINE POINT SEVEN FIVE PERCENT. THE CITY OF BERKELEY NEEDS LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY FOR AN INCREASE TO OF TO THEIR CURRENT TRANSACTIONS AND USE TAXES. THE CITY OF BERKLEY FACES CHALLENGES THAT ARE UNIQUE TO THE BORDERS OF THE CITY. BY PROVIDING THE CITY WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO BRING A SMALL TAX INCREASE BEFORE IT'S VOTERS THE VOTERS CAN WEIGH IN WHETHER FUNDING THAT WILL IMPROVE POLICE RELATIONS. THE PORT COMMUNITY POLICING. RELIEF TO RESIDENTS SUFFERING FROM MENTAL ILLNESS AND HELP ADDRESS HOMELESS ENCAMPMENTS IS NEEDED I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. WITH ME TODAY HAVE JUST SEE OUR WHEN. I TO GAIN THAT'S BEAUTIFUL OF FROM THE MEN OF THE MAYOR BERKELEY. WELCOME. THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FOR. PRESENTING THE SPELLING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. ON THE CITY BERKELEY THE SPONSOR OF ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY NINE TWENTY AND I WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER THURMAN FOR HIS LEADERSHIP. ON THIS BILL AS WAS NOTED ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY NINE TWENTY WILL CRITICS DUTCH WAY WAIVER OF THE CURRENT. TRANSACTION AND USE TAXES SPECIFICALLY FOR THE CITY OF BERKELEY. WHICH WERE BY OUR CITY THE OPPORTUNITY BRING A CONSERVATIVE TAX INCREASE BEFORE LOCAL VOTERS. THIS MEASURE IF APPROVED BY THE VOTERS WILL GENERATE MUCH NEEDED FUNDING. TO IMPROVE OUR COMMITTEE POLICING PROGRAM PROVIDE RELIEF TO RESIDENTS SUFFERING FROM MENTAL ILLNESS AND HELP ADDRESS THE CRISIS OF HOMELESSNESS ON OUR STREETS. THE CITY OF BERKELEY IS CURRENT TAX RATE IS NINE POINT TWO FIVE PERCENT. WHICH IS EXACTLY TWO PERCENT ABOVE THE STATEWIDE. RATE OF SEVEN POINT TWO FIVE PERCENT. ALONG THE CITY OF BERKELEY TO IMPOSE AN INCREMENTAL RATE OF NO MORE THAN POINT FIVE PERCENT ABOVE THE CURRENT CAP. WILL BRING THE CITIES CURRENT TAX RATE IN SALES TAX RATE TO. NINE POINT SEVEN FIVE PERCENT THEM WITH THESE FUNDS AS WAS NOTED. WE SEEK TO NOT ONLY. ADDRESS.

WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE WITNESSES OPPOSED YES MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS ACT GOOD AFTERNOON DAVID WILL FOR THE HOWARD JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION OPPOSED TO. AB TWENTY NINE TWENTY. AND MEMBERS JUST SO WE'RE CAR OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A TAX AUTHORIZATION BILL. SAUDI SAY THAT DOES ONLY REQUIRE A MAJORITY VOTE WE CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT. BUT WERE OBVIOUSLY CONCERNED ANYTIME THERE IS A SALES TAX EXEMPTION ABOVE AND BEYOND THE TWO PERCENT BRADLEY BURNS RATE YOU KNOW ON THIS HAVE SENT WOULD CERTAINLY TAKE THE CITY OF BERKELEY OVER THAT. IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT. YOU KNOW SHOULD THIS GIVE VOTER APPROVAL ON PASS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THE NINE POINT SEVEN FIVE RATE THE BERKELEY WOULD HAVE ONLY TWENTY FOUR THE MUNICIPALITIES IN CALIFORNIA OR ABOUT FIVE PERCENT OF THE CITIES IN THE STATE. ACTUALLY HAVE A SALES TAX AMOUNT THAT HIGH. SEN. PRETTY DRAMATIC AND ESPECIALLY DRAMATIC BECAUSE YOU KNOW SALES TAXES ARE OBVIOUSLY VERY REGRESSIVE. OBVIOUSLY AND YOU KNOW HURT MORE LOWER INCOME INDIVIDUALS AS A GENERAL RULE. YOU KNOW WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT YOU PERCENT BRADLEY BURNS RATE HAS BEEN IN PLACE FOR DECADES AND WITH GOOD REASON AS. GUARDS. TAX COMPLIANCE MOST NOTABLY. THERE'S A NUMBER OF CITIES THAT ARE AND HAVE TO DEAL WITH DIFFERENT TAX RATES ACROSS THE VARIOUS AREAS OF THE MUNICIPALITY AND IT MAKES IT HARDER TO CLICK CELLS. SO THAT'S AN ISSUE TO USE IT FOR BOTH OF THOSE REASONS ASK FOR A NUMBER. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GREAT. QUESTION. THANK YOU MONITOR AND DODD JUST OF. I THOUGHT WAS INTERESTING THAT. TIME I THOUGHT I HEARD IN TESTIMONY WAS A CONSERVATIVE TAX INCREASE. I GUESS THAT'S A RELATIVE TERM. FOR MANY FOLKS. ANYWAY YOU'RE KIND OF YOURS. JUST FOR A POINT OF CLARIFICATION TODAY'S VOTE IS NOT AN ACTUAL VOTE OF FOR A TAX INCREASE IT'S SIMPLY A VOTE TO ALLOW THE CITY TO GO BEFORE VOTERS. FOR WHAT THEY WOULD CONSIDER A TAX INCREASE. CORRECT AREN'T SUPER THANK YOU. STONE. A TRUE AND JUST AND JUST TO FOLLOW ON WITH PROP THIRTEEN WHICH THE VOTERS ENACTED WHICH PUTS ARTIFICIAL LIMITS ON PROPERTY TAX WHICH HAVE CITIES HAVE TYPICALLY FUNDED THEMSELVES. CAESAR IN THE UNENVIABLE POSITION OF HAVING TO GO OUT AND DO REGRESSIVE TAXES AND. AND THINGS THAT THAT HAVE REAL SIGNIFICANT IMBALANCE IN IN HOW REVENUE ULTIMATELY IS RAISED AND THAT'S WHY WE'VE BEEN TALK ABOUT FEES HERE WE WERE TALKING ABOUT. SALES TAX INCREASE PARCEL TAXES AND OTHERS. SO I I THINK IT THE CITY OF BERKLEY WANTS TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION WITH ITS VOTERS. THAT SHOULD BE SOMETHING THAT THAT WE DEFINITIONS ALLOW. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. WE HAVE A MOTION BY MISTER GRAYSON SECOND BY MISTER STONE. AND THE. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE.
