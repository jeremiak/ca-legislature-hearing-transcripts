THESE WORKSHOPS WILL PROVIDE A FORUM FOR US TO COLLABORATE WITH PARTNER AGENCIES STAKEHOLDERS IN THE PUBLIC. AND TO FURTHER STRENGTHEN OUR GUIDELINES AND IMPROVE OUR REPORTING PROCESSES. THAT CONCLUDES MY TESTIMONY BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. OKAY WE'LL HOLD QUESTIONS THE TO TELL ALL THE OTHER PANELISTS -- HAVE FINISHED OKAY AROUND HERE OKAY THANK YOU SENATOR SO A GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY MY NAME'S THE RAIN OR TAKE -- INSPECTOR GENERAL CALTRANS. THE SERGEANTS PASSING OUT A HANDOUT THAT I PLAN TO SPEAK FROM THIS AFTERNOON -- THANK YOU IT WILL BE HELPFUL -- THE FIRST PAGE OF THE HANDOUT IS OUR WHERE I THOUGHT IT WOULD START WHICH IS THE ORGANIZATION OF THE OFFICE -- SO FAR SO. AS YOU ALL KNOW THE THE INDEPENDENT OFFICE OF AUDITS INVESTIGATIONS WAS ESTABLISHED IN SB ONE IT HAS A BROAD CHARGE TO ENSURE THE EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE USE OF RESOURCES BY CALTRANS AND BY LOCAL ENTITIES WHO RECEIVE FUNDING FROM CALTRANS -- YOU MAY NOT KNOW THAT A LEADER -- BUDGET -- BILL IN A BUDGET PROPOSAL COMBINED THE EXISTING INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION THAT CALTRANS HAD AND THE INSPECTOR GENERAL'S OFFICE. AND SO A GOOD PART OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN INVOLVED -- DOING A LITTLE BIT OF WORK TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO INCORPORATE THE TWO MISSIONS WHAT THE INTERNAL WORK THAT WAS ALREADY ON GOING AND THEN THIS -- OF NEW CHARGE TO AN INSPECTOR GENERAL THAT WAS INDEPENDENT OF THE DEPARTMENT AND REPORTING -- TO EXTERNAL ENTITIES REPORTING TO THE CDC LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR AND SO -- WHAT YOU HAVE HERE IS HOW SO FAR? AN ADDITIONAL -- CHANGE THAT CAME AFTER SB ONE PASSED WAS THE PASSAGE OF SB ONE OF THREE WHICH WAS -- IN PART -- EIGHTY TRICK A BUDGET TRAILER BILL KIND OF CLEAN UP BILL -- MAKING SOME CHANGES THAT -- CAME UP IN SB ONE AND THEN ALSO -- ADDING SOME NEW ITEMS ONE OF THOSE NEW ITEMS WAS A CHARGE TO THE INSPECTOR GENERAL TO REPORT ON A CALTRANS IS EFFORTS TO INCREASE CONTRACTS WITH DISADVANTAGED BUSINESSES AND SMALL BUSINESSES. AND SO AS A RESULT OF THAT BILL THE GOVERNOR APPOINTED A DEPUTY INSPECTOR GENERAL FOR DIVERSITY AND SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT AND SO YOU SEE THAT BOX -- ON THE ON THE ORGANIZATIONAL CHART AND DEBBIE LUMPKIN IS CHARGED WITH -- LOOKING OUT THE OUTREACH EFFORTS AND THE SMALL BUSINESS -- AND DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS OUTREACH. JUST GETTING INTO A LITTLE BIT OF THE THE DIFFERENT OFFICES WITHIN. THE AUDIT FUNCTION. THE WAY WE IT IS AROUND THE MAJOR PROGRAMS THAT CAL TRANS SO UNDER EACH OF THESE HEADINGS FINANCE AND OPERATIONS PROJECT DELIVERY PLANNING IN MODAL YOU'LL SEE THE MAJOR PROGRAM AREAS THAT CALTRANS AND SO THAT'S HOW WE'VE -- TRY TO ORGANIZE THE OFFICE AT THIS POINT AND THEN FINALLY THERE'S A CATEGORY OF ALL INVESTIGATIONS AND THAT IS THE STAFF THAT DOES THE INVESTIGATIONS INTO ADMINISTRATIVE MISCONDUCT. MOVING ON TO PAGE THREE THIS IS A AN EXCERPT FROM THE FIRST REPORT THAT WE SUBMITTED TO THE LEGISLATURE IN NOVEMBER -- IT REPORTS TO YOU AND AND TO THE PUBLIC BECAUSE IT IS POSTED ON OUR WEBSITE. OF THE NUMBER OF AUDITS THAT WERE COMPLETED IN DIFFERENT CATEGORIES -- WOULD MAKE ONE NOTE FOR YOU ON UNDER THE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX ON ITS THAT'S CALTRANS PROGRAMS CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS LOCAL AGENCY AUDITS AND THEN. A LARGE CATEGORY IS PROPOSITION ONE BE ON ITS AND YOU MAY RECALL THAT THOSE AUDITS ARE REQUIRED BY THE BOND MEASURE -- BUT THAT OF COURSE WILL BE DECLINING OVER TIME AND AS WITH THE RESOURCES. DEDICATED TO THOSE AUDITS -- A COUPLE OTHER CATEGORIES I WOULD KNOW FOR YOU THE HUNDRED AND FIFTY ONE FINANCIAL DOCUMENT REVIEWS THESE ARE ESSENTIALLY BIDS THAT COME INTO CALTRANS THAT -- OUR STAFF WORKS ON REVIEWING THOSE ON IN MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS BACK TO CALTRANS ABOUT -- WHAT SHOULD BE IN -- INCLUDED OR NOT INCLUDED IN A IN A CONTRACT MOVING HEARING FIRMS -- AS I MENTIONED THERE'S AN INVESTIGATIONS UNIT OF THAT UNIT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR BOTH OF THEM COMPLAINTS THAT COME IN. REGARDING EMPLOYEE MISCONDUCT BUT ALSO A WE ARE NOW OPERATING THE CALTRANS ETHICS HELPLINE IT SO QUAN SORRY WHISTLEBLOWER HOTLINE IT DOESN'T QUITE HAVE THE STATUTORY. PROTECTIONS OR STRUCTURE AS SAY THE STATE AUDITOR'S WHISTLEBLOWER HOTLINE BUT IT IT DOES REALLY FUNCTION THAT WAY IN THAT EMPLOYEES CAN CALL IN AND REPORT ANY CONCERNS THEY HAVE ABOUT -- WASTE FRAUD ABUSE OR ETHICAL LAPSES. OUT OF THE NINETY ONE COMPLAINTS OF MISCONDUCT IN THE OF THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN YEAR TWENTY EIGHT WERE SUBSTANTIATED. A MOVING DOWN TO THE OTHER CATEGORY THAT I WOULD KNOW THE SEVENTY FIVE LOCAL AGENCY REVIEWS THESE ARE OF REVIEWS ARE FOLKS DO OF RATES THAT ARE CHARGED BY LOCAL ENTITIES THE CALTRANS SO WE DO A REVIEW OF WHETHER. A LOCAL AGENCIES -- OVERHEAD RATE THAT THEY CHARGE CALTRANS IS APPROPRIATE AND THAT'S WHERE THOSE REVIEWS COME IN. MOVING TO PAGE FOUR OF THE JUST QUICKLY THIS IS. OF THE SAME INFORMATION THAT YOU SAW ON PAGE THREE BUT THIS IS FOR QUARTER ONE QUARTER TO OF EIGHTEEN NINETEEN OF MOST MOST OF IT LOOKS TO BE ON TRACK WITH THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR I WOULD NOTE THOUGH THAT -- IF YOU LOOK AT THE CALL OF OUR THE THE CATEGORY THE FINANCIAL DOCUMENT REVIEWS OF ARCHITECTURAL ENGINEERING FIRMS YOU'LL SEE THAT WERE ALREADY AT A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FOR TWO QUARTERS. WHEREAS LAST YEAR WAS A HUNDRED AND FIFTY ONE TO INCREASES ONE IS. A AN INCREASE IN IN THE THE NUMBER OF BEDS THAT ARE COMING AND SO THE ADS CALTRANS IS RAMPING UP THE NUMBER PROJECTS THAT ARE GOING OUT -- WE'RE DOING MORE REVIEWS TO TO GET THOSE PROJECTS GOING SO I THINK IT REFLECTS THE INCREASED WORKLOAD AS A RESULT OF SB. ONE AND THEN ALSO INCREASES THE REFLECTS AN INCREASE THAT AS A RESULT OF A BUDGET PROPOSAL THAT WAS APPROVED LAST YEAR THAT ALLOWED US TO EXPAND SOME LOOKING INTO THE BITS AGO INTO LOCAL AGENCIES SO WHAT WE'RE DOING BOTH THE STATE AND LOCAL AGENCY CONTRACTOR HE'S. MOVING THE PAGE -- FIVE AND SIX JUST HERE I THOUGHT I WOULD HIGHLIGHT TO AUDITS THAT WERE RELEASED IN -- TWENTY EIGHTEEN THAT ARE SPECIFIC TO SB ONE SO ONE IS -- THE WHAT WE CALL THE BASELINE FOR SB ONE PERFORMANCE OUTCOMES -- THIS IS AN AUDIT THAT THE STAFF DID -- TO REALLY INSURE THAT THERE WAS AN ACCURATE BASELINE FOR MEASURING SOME OF THESE THINGS GOING FORWARD SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT MEASURING THE NUMBER BRIDGES FIXED OR THE NUMBER OF OF COLBERT'S REPAIRED AND IDENTIFIED. IS WE DID THE DEPARTMENT ESTABLISH AN APPROPRIATE BASELINE SO THAT IN FIVE YEARS IF YOU'RE MEASURING THE OUTCOMES CAN WE BE SURE THAT WE'RE COMPARING APPLES TO APPLES AND WE REALLY DID GET -- THOSE DOLLARS -- ONE CATEGORY THAT WAS NOT COMPLETED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND IS UNDER WAY NOW IS A REVIEW OF THE BASS LINE ON PAVEMENT AND SO -- ESTABLISHING THE APPROPRIATE MEASUREMENT OF THE PAVEMENT CONDITION TO COMPARE THAT TO THE OUTCOMES OVER TIME. PAGE SIX TALKS ABOUT AN AUDIT WE DID ON THE EFFICIENCY MEASURES SO AS YOU ALL KNOW SB ONE REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT TO IDENTIFY. ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND EFFICIENCIES -- FOR THOSE FUNDS TO BE REINVESTED INTO A REHABILITATION AND MAINTENANCE -- THIS AUDIT FOCUSED PRIMARILY ON THE METHODOLOGY THAT THE DEPARTMENT USED IN IS IN IDENTIFYING AND REPORTING THE EFFICIENCY MEASURES. TO THE CITY SEE A WE DID NOT IN THIS AUDIT GET INTO WHETHER THE DOLLARS THAT THEY CALCULATED WERE ACCURATE THAT IS THE AUDIT THAT IS UNDER WAY TODAY SO WE REALLY FOCUS ON METHODOLOGY -- LOOKING AT DID THEY ESTABLISH A PROPER A PROPER BASELINE PUT IN TRACKING MEASURES AND DO THEY HAVE THE SUPORT TO DOCUMENT THE SAVINGS ARE ACTUALLY THERE -- WE ALSO -- AS A RESULT OF THAT PROCESS CREATED A CAN OF ONE PAGE GUIDANCE DOCUMENT THAT WE HAVE SHARED WITH THE OF THE DEPARTMENT'S PROGRAMS. TO HELP THEM THINK ABOUT AS THEY'RE LOOKING AT CHANGES THAT THEY'RE MAKING HOW WOULD THEY HOW WOULD THEY USE AN APPROPRIATE METHODOLOGY SAVINGS AND THEN REPORTED ON FUTURE EFFICIENCY -- MEASURE REPORTS. SO MOVING TO PAGE SEVEN THIS IS A JUST A LIST OF SOME UPCOMING AUDIT REPORTS THAT I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN THESE WILL BE COMING OUT WITHIN THE NEXT. FEW MONTHS OF MOST OF THEM ARE TIED SPECIFICALLY TO SB ONE DIRECTION'S OR SB ONE OF THREE SO AS I MENTIONED THERE'S THE IN EFFICIENCY MEASURES VERIFICATION AUDIT THIS IS WHERE WE WILL ACTUALLY TALK ABOUT A DO WE SEE THIS THE SAVINGS THAT THE DEPARTMENT IDENTIFIED -- RELATED TO SB ONE OH THREE THERE'S A AN AUDIT ON GOING AROUND THE CERTIFICATION OF DISADVANTAGED BUSINESSES AND INSURING AS SB ONE OF THREE REQUIRED THAT A BUSINESSES ARE NOT ATTEMPTING TO CIRCUMVENT THOSE RULES -- SB ONE ASKED THAT WE REVIEW THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CALTRANS IS -- ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM THAT ALL GETS UNDERWAY AGAIN I MENTIONED THE PICK THE PAVEMENT BASS LINE AUDIT -- WE HAVE A REVIEW OF THE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM BOTH THE INTERNAL OPERATION OF THAT PROGRAM AND THE MANAGEMENT OF THOSE DOLLARS AND ALSO SOME LOCAL ENTITIES WHO RECEIVED. ATP GRANTS -- THERE'S A AUDIT OF THE DIVISION OF REAL A MASS TRANSIT. THAT WILL BE COMING OUT SHORTLY AN EIGHTY REVIEW OF THE DISPARITY STUDY -- WHICH IS THE STUDY THAT ACTUALLY LEADS -- TO THE DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE GOALS THAT THE DEPARTMENT HOUSE TO A CHIEF. SO I'M GONNA STOP MY REMARKS THERE AND I'LL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AT THE END. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- CHARTER EDISON THE DEPUTY SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION JOHN WELCOME. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN DEL IN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M CHAD ADDISON W. SECULAR TRANSPORTATION AT THE STATE TRANSPORTATION AGENCY THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TODAY.

CALTRANS WILL DISCUSS OTHER IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF SB ONE IMPLEMENTATION ONE TIME COMPLETE. HI GIVEN THE MY SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTISE ISRAEL IN TRANSIT I WILL DISCUSS THE FIVE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS OF TRANSLATING INTERCITY RAIL. A CAPITAL PROGRAM FUNDING PROGRAMS TO DATE. AS WELL AS THE PROGRESS MADE IN DISTRIBUTING OVER A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF STATE RAIL ASSISTANCE TO COMMUTER AN INTERCITY RAIL AGENCIES IN THE FUTURE OF BOTH PROGRAMS. SENSE THE AT TWENTY FOURTEEN CREATION OF THE TRANSIT INTERCITY RAIL CAPITAL PROGRAM OVER FIVE BILLION DOLLARS HAS BEEN PROGRAMMED TO FIFTY SIX PROJECTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND GIVEN THAT OUR STATE FUNDING ONLY MAKES UP A PORTION OF THE FUNDING USE ON THESE PROJECTS WHEN YOU COMBINE OTHER STATE FEDERAL AND LOCAL FUNDS. AND THE TOTAL INVESTMENT IN THESE PROJECTS EXCEEDS TWENTY THREE BILLION DOLLARS. I'M THOUSANDS OF JOBS IN CALIFORNIA TIED TO THESE PROJECTS IN ALMOST ALL OF THE PROJECTS ARE PROVIDING NEEDED TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENTS TO DISADVANTAGED AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. OVER EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF OUR FUNDING HAS BEEN ALLOCATED TO DATE. AND A GREAT DEAL MORE IS EXPECTED TO BE REQUESTED FOR ALLOCATION IN THE COMING FISCAL YEAR. WE HAVE SUPPORTED TRANSFORMATIVE PROJECTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE JOSE -- AREN'T WE WE'VE CONTRIBUTED SIGNIFICANT TIME TO GET THAT THE GROWTH OF BARK CAPACITY UNDER UNDER THE DAY ON THE EXISTING SYSTEM. ADDING THIRTY SEVEN RAIL CARS TO THE CALTRAIN ORDERS THAT CAN OPERATE SEVEN CAR TRAINS ON ALL TEAM INTO SAN FRANCISCO SERVICES AFTER COMPLETING ELECTRIFICATION. INVESTING IN MAJOR TRANSIT SERVICE EXPANSIONS BY LA METRO. LA D. O. T.'S DASH SYSTEMIC METROLINK IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.

SB ONE FUNDING HAS SIGNIFICANTLY HELPED ENABLE THESE WIDE RANGING COMMITMENTS. THE PROGRAM IS SCHEDULED TO MAKE ON GOING INVESTMENTS WITH ADDITIONAL PROGRAMMING EVERY TWO YEARS. THE NEXT CALL FOR PROJECTS WILL GO OUT IN APPROXIMATELY MID SEPTEMBER WITH THE WORDS BEING MADE BY APRIL OF TWENTY TWENTY AND EVERY TWO YEARS THEREAFTER. SB ONE ALSO CREATED ANOTHER PROGRAM THAT THE TRANSPORTATION AGENCY ADMINISTERS. THE STATE RAIL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM FUNDED WITH HALF A PERCENT OF THE DIESEL SALES AND USE TAX. EXPECTED TO GENERATE A CUMULATIVE REVENUE OF JUST OVER A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS BY THE END OF NEXT FISCAL YEAR. IN OVER FORTY MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR THERE AFTER THIS PROGRAM DELIVER SEVEN EIGHTHS OF ITS REVENUE. TO COMMUTER AND INTERCITY RAIL SERVICES ON A FORMULA BASIS. WITH A SMALL AMOUNT OF INTERCITY RAIL FUNDING FOR DISCRETIONARY ALLOCATION TO EMERGING IN EXPANDING RAIL SERVICES. THE REVENUE FOR THIS PROGRAM IS HELPING SUPPORT BOTH CAPITAL INVESTMENTS AND OPERATIONS BY A REAL PROVIDERS. THIS NOVEMBER AND RAIL TRANSIT SYSTEM IS USING ITS FUNDING TO OFFER INCREASED WEEKDAY AND WEEKEND RAIL OPERATIONS. MR IN SAN DIEGO IS USING ITS FUNDS TO HELP PURCHASE FIVE CLEAN TEAR FOR SIEMENS CHARGER LOCOMOTIVES BUILT HERE IN SACRAMENTO. ALAMEDA QUARTER EXPRESSIBLE USE ITS FUNDS TO RUN THROUGH SATURDAY SERVICES. IN OUR OTHER OPERATORS ARE USING FUNDS TO PURSUE MANY VALUABLE SMALL AND LARGE CAPITAL PROJECTS. MOST OF THE FUNDING HAS ALREADY BEEN PROGRAM THROUGH NEXT FISCAL YEAR ABOUT THIRTEEN MILLION OF DISCRETIONARY MONEY WILL BE AWARDED TO INNER CITY RAIL AGENCIES IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE -- AND THEN LOOKING FORWARD WE EXPECT ADDITIONAL PROJECTS TO COMMIT BE COMMITTED TO STARTING WITH THE FISCAL YEAR. TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE THIS REVENUE STREAM ALONG WITH THE INCREASE TO TRANSIT FORMULA ASSISTANCE A THE FLOWS THROUGH OTHER SB ONE PROGRAM'S IS INVALUABLE TO GROWING IN IMPROVING OUR TRANSIT SERVICES STATEWIDE. THE NEW REVENUES OF SUPPORTED INCREDIBLY VALUABLE PROJECTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH FUTURE PROJECTS SPONSORS TO HELP THEM DEVELOP GOOD PROJECTS THAT FIT WELL WITH THE PROGRAM OBJECTIVES. SO WE CAN GROW TRANSIT AND RAIL RIDERSHIP WHILE REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME GLAD TO TAKE QUESTIONS AT THE END. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. W. SECRETARY AS JIM DAVIS FROM CALTRANS. YOU HAVE THE FOR GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR SENATORS MY NAME IS JIM DAVIS IN MY CURRENT ROLE CALTRANS IS SPECIAL ADVISER TO DIRECTOR BERMAN. I'M GLAD TO BE HERE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT THE GREAT THINGS CALTRANS IS DOING WITH SB WANT. SB ONE PROVIDE AN ESTIMATED FIFTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS HAVE FOR THE STATE. AND NOW FOR THE LOCALS. I'M GLAD REPORT THE CALTRANS IS ON TARGET TO MEET THE PERFORMANCE GOALS. THE CHIEF DEPUTY WISE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER. WHILE ALSO MEANER EFFICIENCY GOALS OF A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. SINCE THE PASSAGE OF THIS LEGISLATION CALTRANS IS COMPLETED NINETY PROJECTS IN OVER FOUR HUNDRED MORE WILL PROJECTS ARE IN THE WORKS. THIS INCLUDES REHABILITATED MORE THAN THIRTEEN HUNDRED LANE MILES OF PAVEMENT. FIXING THE SEVENTY ONE BRIDGES. AND INCREASING VISIBILITY FOR DRIVERS WITH HIGHLY REFLECTIVE SIX INCH LANE STRIPING OF MORE THAN SEVEN THOUSAND LANE MILES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. IN THE COMING HERE CAL TRANS WILL FIX AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED LANE MILES OF PAVEMENT. MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY BRIDGES. FIVE THOUSAND DRAINAGE SYSTEMS ALMOST TEN THOUSAND MILES A NEW LANE STRIPING. AND MORE THAN TWELVE HUNDRED CONGESTION REDUCING TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT ELEMENTS. THESE NUMBERS ARE IMPRESSIVE BUT EVEN THEY DO NOT FULLY TELL THE STORY WOULD A GAME CHANGER SB ONE COMBINED WITH CALTRANS NEW ASSET MANAGER PLAN. IS PROVING TO BE. CALTRANS IS WORKING BETTER. FASTER AND SMARTER. WITH PROJECT PROGRAMMING NOW BEEN DRIVEN AT THE DISTRICT LEVEL FORCES AT THE STATE LEVEL AND STARTING ADDRESS MULTIPLE ASSET CLASSES. IN A SINGLE PROJECT. THIS DEMONSTRATES THE SHIFT FROM SILO BASED APPROACH. TO SYSTEM WIDE ASSESSMENT. PERFORMANCE DRIVER APPROACH TO INVESTMENT. WE'VE GIVEN DISTRICTS PERFORMANCE MEASURES. TO ME PAIRED WITH THE MONEY. TO MEET THEM. THIS IS THE HOUSE DISTRICTS MORE FLEXIBILITY ACCOUNTABILITY IN OPPORTUNITY FIND CREATIVE SOLUTIONS. IT HAS BETTER PARTNERS WITH LOCAL AGENCIES HAS DISTRICTS FIND MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR JOINT PROJECTS MAKING BOTH. STATE AND LOCAL DOLLARS MORE EFFECTIVE. WE'VE ALSO PRODUCED A TEN YOUR BOOK. TEN YEARS WORTH OF PROJECTS. TO HELP US LOOK INTO THE FUTURE AT THE PROJECT THAT WE'RE GONNA BE WORKING ON IN A START BE ABLE TO PARTNER WITH OUR LOCAL PARTNERS TO LOOK IN THE FUTURE WHAT PART IS WE CAN PARTNER. CAN BECOME MORE EFFICIENT TOGETHER. LET ME HIGHLIGHT A FEW EXAMPLES OF SB ONE PROJECTS. ONE POINT TWO BILLION WE SPENT ON PROJECTS ON INTERSTATE TEN IN SAN BERNARDINO AND RIVERSIDE COUNTIES WHICH WILL INCLUDE BRIDGE REPLACEMENT. PAVEMENT REPLACEMENT IMPROVEMENTS TO OLDER'S AND RAMPS. IMPROVING THIS VITAL ECONOMIC QUARTER IS IMPERATIVE BUSINESSES AND INDIVIDUALS ALIKE. THE FIVE HUNDRED FORTY MILLION DOLLAR GOLDEN STATE CHOKE POINT RELIEF PROJECT ON INTERSTATE FIVE BETWEEN BECAUSE STAKE IN SANTA CLARITA. RECEIVED TWO HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN MILLION IN SB ONE TRADE QUARTER FUNDS. IN TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION AND LOCAL FUNDS TO LEVERAGE FORTY SEVEN MILLION IN FEDERAL AND FOR GRANT FUNDED. THE PROJECT WILL ADD TRUCK LANES IN CARPOOL LANES. IMPROVING TRAFFIC SAFETY CONGESTION AND FREE MOBILITY. HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN MILLION WILL BE SPENT ON PROJECTS ON THE VITAL INTERSTATE EIGHT EIGHTY FREIGHT AND COMMUTE CORRIDOR IN THE BAY AREA. TO VAMP BRIDGES MAKE COMPLETE STREET IMPROVEMENTS SMOOT TRAFFIC FLOW WITH RENT METERS REPLACE OTHER TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT SYSTEM ELEMENTS. REPLACING A REHABILITATION TWO HUNDRED LANE MILES OF PAVEMENT. AND HAD A CONCRETE MEDIAN BARRIER ON A SEGMENT IN OAKLAND. ALMOST THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY NEW NINE MILLION WILL BE SPENT. ON SIXTEEN PROJECTS ON HIGHWAY NINETY NINE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. IMPROVING PAVEMENT. BRIDGES AND DRAINAGE ON IS VITAL ROUTE. MORE EXAMPLES OF STATE AND LOCAL SB ONE PROJECTS WILL CONTINUE BE AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC UNDER WEBSITE REBUILDING CA DOT CA DOT G. O. V.. AS PART OF CALTRANS COMMITMENT TO TRANSPARENCY. ANOTHER IMPORTANT COMPONENT OR THE INNOVATIONS CALTRANS IS PURSUING TO MEET THE EFFICIENCY REQUIREMENT OF SB. ONE CALTRANS IS FOCUSED ON IDENTIFYING DEFICIENCIES IN THREE AREAS. PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS. TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATIVE TOOLS AND SAVED A HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLION LAST YEAR. A SIGNIFICANT PROCESS CHANGE CAME IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN WHEN CALTRANS BEGAN STREAMLINING MORE THAN THIRTEEN THOUSAND FEDERAL ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS WERE TAKEN ON THE ASSIGNMENT OF THE FEDERAL HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION RESPONSIBILITIES. UNDER THE NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION ACT. THIS IS SERVED AN AVERAGE OF APPROXIMATELY SAVED APPROXIMATELY -- AVERAGE OF ONE YEAR FOR COMPLEX IN FORMAL DOCUMENTS. EXAMPLES IN THE PAST AND COULD BE ANY ARC BRIDGE THE DUMBARTON BRIDGE IMPROVEMENTS AND CARPOOL LANES AND REPAVING INTERSTATE FIVE IN STOCKTON. AND ADD A RECONSTRUCTED INTERCHANGE AND WHINING IN THE MOB THE BRIDGE ON INTERSTATE. FIFTEEN STATUTORY AUTHORITY FOR THIS PROGRAM IS SET TO EXPIRE AT THE END OF THIS YEAR. EVEN THOUGH WE'RE LOOKING AT WAYS TO STREAMLINE OUR ENVIRONMENTAL ASSIGNMENT FROM THE ANOTHER KEY PROCESS IMPROVEMENT HAS BEEN THE USE OF VALUE ANALYSIS WHICH IS REVIEW PROCESS DESIGNED ELIMINATE UNNECESSARY COSTS. TO DO NOT ADD QUALITY GRANT ELEMENTS THAT ADD VALUE TO PROJECT. CALTRANS ABORTED SIXTY TWO MILLION COSTS USING THIS PROCESS LAST YEAR. SINCE THEN HAS SINCE THE SUCCESS OF WHAT WE SEE IN THE VA PROGRAM WE HAVE LOWERED THE PROJECT DOLLARS THRESHOLD FOR ENGAGING IN THIS REVIEW FROM FIFTY MILLION WHICH GENERATE THOSE DOLLARS TO NOW TWENTY FIVE MILLION. TWO CHIEF EVEN MORE SAVINGS. ANOTHER PROCESS CHANGE WE HAVE BEEN INSTIGATED IS THAT OF BUNDLING PROJECTS. BY GROUPING DIFFERENT ASSET PROJECTS IN THE SAME LOCATION WE CAN BENEFIT FROM ECONOMIES OF SCALE. WE ALSO CREATE MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PARTNERING WITH OUR LOCAL AGENCIES. AND WE ARE STOPPING A PROJECT RELATED PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS. LAST YEAR WE PUT A MASS HIRING EVENTS ON BROUGH NEEDED STAFF MORE QUICKLY AND EFFICIENTLY THIS ALLOWED US TO HIRE SIX HUNDRED TWENTY SIX EMPLOYEES TO DELIVER PROJECTS. MORE QUICKLY. CALTRANS ISN'T PILOTING AN INNOVATIVE CONTRACTING TO CALL CONSTRUCTION MANAGER GENERAL CONTRACTOR OR CMG CITY. THIS CONTRACTING TOOL ALLOWS CALTRANS TO HIRE A CONTRACTOR DURING THE DESIGN PROCESS. PROVIDING A VALUABLE INPUT THAT CAN REDUCE COSTS AND CHANGE ORDER. IN BETTER MANAGE RHYS. CALTRANS SAVE MORE THAN EIGHTY MILLION A FIVE PROJECTS LAST YEAR INCLUDING MORE THAN FORTY FOUR MILLION ON SB ONE FUNDED PROJECTS. LAST YEAR WITH THE HELP OF CENTER BELL. THE LEGISLATURE RECOGNIZED THE POTENTIAL OF THIS TOOL PROVIDED CALTRANS WITH PERMANENT CMG SEE IF THE WORD. WE'RE INCREASING THE USE OF THIS TOOL IN THE COMING YEARS TO PRODUCE EVEN MORE SAVINGS. ON THE TECHNOLOGY FRONT CALTRANS IS DEVELOPING NEW SIX INSULIN STRIPING ON ITS ROADWAYS. THESE PERMANENT THERMOPLASTIC TRY STRIPES ENHANCE NIGHTTIME VISIBILITY AND HAVE A LONGER LIFESPAN WHICH REDUCES LIFE CYCLE COSTS IN REDUCES WORKER SAFETY CONCERNS -- ALSO BEGINNING TO APPLY NEW TECHNOLOGY THAT WAS ENGAGE WITH DURING OUR MERCH REPLACEMENT THE FIVE FOR CANYON BRIDGE IN BIG SUR ALLOWED CALTRANS TO CONSTRUCT THIS PROJECT WITHIN EIGHT MONTHS. THIS ENTAILED AN ACCELERATED BRIDGE REPLACEMENT WHICH PRE FABRICATED MULTIPLE BRIDGE ELEMENTS REDUCING CONSTRUCTION TIME IN A MONTH IN MINIMIZING IMPACTS TO THE ENVIRONMENT. IN ADDITION TO PROVING PAYMENT SB ONE IS ALSO IMPROVING OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE. CALTRANS IS ALREADY BROUGHT ON A THOUSAND NEW EMPLOYEES AND AS PART OF THIS YEAR'S PROPOSED BUDGET IS LOOKING TO HIRE MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED MAIN ITS WORKERS. THESE MAIN HIS POSITIONS A KEY PART OF OUR ASSET MANAGER STRATEGY ADDRESS BE. ONE BUT THEY'RE ALSO A GREAT FIRST STEP OPPORTUNITIES FOR THOSE WITH NONTRADITIONAL BACKGROUNDS INCLUDING HOMELESSNESS INCARCERATION. CALTRANS IS HARD MORE THAN SEVENTY PARTICIPANTS OF OUR PAROLE YOU WORK CREW. PROGRAM IS PERMANENT AND MAIN ITS EMPLOYEES. CALTRANS FREQUENTLY HOLD HIRING FAIRS ACROSS THE STATE AND WE ARE HAPPY TO PARTNER WITH LEGISLATORS. AND HOSTING EVENTS IN YOUR COMMUNITIES. IN COLLABORATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS CALTRANS IS ALSO INVESTING IN WORK FORCE DEVELOPMENT DESIGNED TO INCREASE THE PARTICIPATION OF HISTORICALLY UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS AND HIGHWAY CONSTRUCTION SKILLED SCRAPS SKILLED CRAFTS. WE RULED OUT A FEDERALLY FUNDED IRONWORKERS BOOT CAMP LAST AUGUST IN THIS MONTH WE BEGAN A WOMAN ONLY BUT CAMP TO CURSE FEMALE PARTICIPATION IN THIS HISTORICALLY MALE FIELD. CALTRANS IS CONTRACTING WITH THE SOUTH A WORKFORCE INVESTMENT BOARD TO PROVIDE PRE APPRENTICESHIP TRAINING. UPON SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION GRADUATES WILL BE ENROLLED IN LOCAL PRESSURE PROGRAMS AND EMPLOYMENT. IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA CALTRANS ENGAGING LADDERS OF OPPORTUNITIES WHICH IS A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT BETWEEN CALTRANS CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY LOS ANGELES AND LONG BEACH DEPARTMENT OF WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROGRAM IS TO INCREASE OVERALL PARTICIPATION OF MINORITIES WOMEN AND DISADVANTAGED INDIVIDUALS IN THE HIGHWAY CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY. THE SPRING CALTRANS WE WORKING DIRECTLY WITH ELECTRICIANS UNION OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND THE OPERATING ENGINEERS UNION OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TO SPONSOR PREMISES. CALTRANS ALSO MAKING CONCERTED EFFORT TO REACH SMALL BUSINESS AND DIVERSE BUSINESSES BUT I'VE NEVER BEFORE CONTRACTED WITH CALTRANS. WE MET THE ETHNIC SPECIFIC CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE THROUGHOUT THE STATE PROVIDING NETWORK IN TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES TO SMALL BUSINESSES. AND ADVERTISE PROJECTS IN SPECIALIZED PUBLICATIONS SAYS THOSE SERVING THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY. AGAIN WE ARE HAPPY TO PARTNER WITH MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE IN HOSTNG FORMS TO INCREASE TRAINING AND REACH FOR SMALL BUSINESS. SO FAR IN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR. CALTRANS IS AWARDED OVER 17% OF FEDERALLY FUNDED CONTRACT DOLLARS TO CERTIFIED DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE. ALONG WITH 34% OF ALL STAKE THE CERTIFIED SMALL BUSINESSES. AND THREE POINT 4% TO DISABLED VETERAN BUSINESS ENTERPRISE. THESE EFFORTS ARE BRINGING THE POSITIVE IMPACTS OF S. ONE IN STATE CONTRACTING TO MORE CALIFORNIANS THAN EVER BEFORE AND WE ARE WORKING TO CONTINUE EXPANDING THESE OPPORTUNITIES AS OUR WORKLOAD CONTINUES TO GROW. OVERALL I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE TRANSFORMATIVE SUCCESS SB ONES HAVE FOR CALTRANS IN LOCAL COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. CALTRANS IS COMMITTED TO BUILDING ON THESE RESULTS EVEN MORE IN THE COMING YEARS. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY SURE THESE ACHIEVEMENTS AND I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE -- THANK YOU PANELISTS THE I THINK WE'LL START WITH QUESTIONS I HAD I HAD ONE NO I'M. TERMS OF THE INITIAL. OUR APPROACH OF GATHERING. FORCES TO INCREASE EFFICIENCY. OF A CALTRANS -- THE PANELISTS MAYBE CAN DISCUSS. HOW WE CAN DO BETTER JOB INCREASING EFFICIENCY A CALTRANS AND -- MAYBE FROM CHAD STANDPOINT THE TRANSIT. A SYSTEMS WE WANT INCREASE PERFORMANCE EFFICIENCY ARE THERE ANY -- EFFORTS WE NEED -- TO UNDERTAKE -- TO INCREASE EFFICIENCY THAT COULD. IS NEEDED IN TERMS OF THE LEGISLATION AND BUDGET OR OR REGULATIONS THAT WE NEED OUT -- GAPS IN OUR IN OUR WORK THAT WE STARTED WITH SP -- ONE PALACE COULD COMMENT ON THAT. I THINK THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION IS RESPONSIBLE FOR REVIEWING. THE A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IS THAT CORRECT HONOR WE WE SERVICE THE TARGET UNDER MILLION. DOLLARS A YEAR OF SAVINGS. AND YOU REVIEW THAT THEY'RE SURE RIGHT YES THEY THEY CAN'T YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT DID YOU THINK OF THAT THAT WAS THE FIRST YEAR WE DO. SO WHAT IT WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT IS THERE ARE OTHER THINGS WE NEED TO DO -- WHAT? CSO THE END AS YOU NOTED THAT THE CALTRANS IS REQUIRED TO SUBMIT IT TO THE COMMISSION THE COMMISSION DOESN'T HAVE AN APPROVAL ROLE -- BUT BUT WE DID YOU REVIEW IT WE WERE MITCHELL DRAFTING GAVE SOME FEEDBACK -- THERE WERE -- THERE WERE A LOT OF THINGS CALTRANS IS DOING THERE THERE ARE QUITE A FEW OTHER THINGS WHICH CALTRANS IS DOING IN AS A JUST STARTED TO QUANTIFY THEY'VE DONE EVEN THEY HAVE OTHER THINGS WHICH THEY HAVEN'T QUANTIFIED AS WELL BUT HAVE STAND STILL BE ABLE. TO ARTICULATE AS EFFICIENCIES AND WE HAVE ENCOURAGE THEM TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THOSE -- INCLUDING SOME OF THE EFFORTS WHICH MAY NOT HAVE IS -- AS BIG OF A DOLLAR AMOUNT WITH THEM BUT ARE IMPORTANT JUST IN NEW YORK IF THERE IF YOU'RE ABLE TO CUT DOWN THE PA THE PROCESSING OF SOME ME A PAPER THAT THAT GETS SUBMITTED BY. FROM FORTY FIVE DAYS TO TWO WEEKS IT MAY NOT OUT A LOT BUT IT'S IT'S AN IMPORTANT FISH AND SEE -- THEIR NUMBER OF A A THEIR THINGS THAT I I THINK -- WE COULD DO JUST AS A STATE ONE OF THE COMMISSION'S RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE LEGISLATURE -- IS -- FOCUSED ON AND RESEARCH AT THAT SPARK SOME OF WHICH IS FUNDED BY SB ONE AND SOME WHICH HAS OTHER FUNDING AND THE IDEA OF CREATING SOME KIND OF CLEARING HOUSE I THINK THE COMMISSION WE WE COULD PLAY A ROLE IN THAT. BUT WHERE THAT WHERE THAT TYPE OF INFORMATION COULD BE SHARED ON RESEARCH THAT'S DONE BY UNIVERSITIES RESEARCH HAS COME BY CALTRANS. ED AND SHARED WITH THE PEOPLE AT COMMISSION MEETINGS AS THESE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE WHO ARE GOING TO IMPLEMENT THEM AND AT IN ACTUALLY. IN CHARGE OF FUNDING PROJECTS THERE WERE CERTAIN TO SEE THE RESEARCH COME OUT THERE THEY'RE BEGINNING TO FINISH. SOME OF THOSE RESEARCH PROJECTS THAT WE'RE INITIALLY FOUND WITH. WISPY WONDERS OTHER PEOPLE HAVE COLLEGE OUT OF YOUR ACCOUNT. YES -- WITHIN WITHIN OUR TRANSIT IN ZERO CAPITAL PROGRAM MANY OF THE TYPES OF CAPITAL PROJECTS AGENCIES ARE PURSUING HELP MAKE THEIR SYSTEMS MORE EFFICIENT ON SOME OF THOSE -- OPERATIONS SAVINGS ARE THEN REINVESTED IN BETTER ERVICES THE FURTHER GROW THE RIDERSHIP AND REVENUES OF THE SYSTEM AND SO THAT THAT IS ONE OF THE AREAS THAT WE GIVE CREDIT TO AS AGENCIES ARE ARE TRYING TO LOOK FOR WAYS TO MAKE THEIR SYSTEMS MORE EFFICIENT. WE ALSO ENCOURAGE MUCH OF THE INTEGRATION BETWEEN SYSTEMS AND CAP PLANNING TOGETHER ON HOW TO MAKE -- TRANSIT AND RAIL COORDINATE WELL IN REGIONS IN THAT THAT ALSO COMES INTO THE AREA OF IMPROVING THE EFFICIENCY OF THE OVERALL SYSTEM. SORRY -- ANYBODY ELSE WANT TO COMMENT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT AS I MENTIONED REMARKS AS WE HAVE STATE LAW. CONTINUES OUR SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY TO THE END OF THE YEAR AT THE END OF THE YEAR WE LOSE THAT AND THENTHE ASSIGNMENT GOES AWAY WITHOUT SOME TYPE OF ADDITIONAL LAW. OKAY THAT'S RELATED TO NEPA. YES SIR OKAY -- THAT'S ON OUR LIST OKAY WE DID THAT ONCE BEFORE WE EXTENDED OUT. SO I THINK THAT'S OF NO FOUR ON THE LIST. YEAH RIGHT ON ONE THING I WOULD ADD IS -- A LOT OF THE SAVINGS THAT ARE IDENTIFIED A REALLY RELATED TO TIME. AND AND NOT HAVING DELAYS AND SO WHAT WE'VE -- KIND OF PUSHED ON IN OUR DISCUSSIONS ON THE EFFICIENCIES THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED SO FAR IS WHERE OF FEES THAT SAID IN A FIGHT AS AN EFFICIENT. A MEASURE FOR THE TIME IS SHORTENED THERE IS TO REALLY LOOK AT THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE PROJECT AND IF YOU'RE LOSING TIME SOMEWHERE ELSE. MAYBE ARE NOT ACHIEVING THE GREATEST EFFICIENCY OVER ALL SO I THINK WE YOU KNOW WE'RE TRYING TO PUSH A LITTLE HARDER ON A LOOKING AT THE END ENTIRE LENGTH OF SOMETHING -- NOT JUST MAKING PARTICULAR PHASE A SHORTER HE EXPEDITED. I I HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION -- MAYBE -- CHAD AND JIM PROBABLY WOULDN'T KNOW THIS -- ONE ONE OF THE RESEARCH PROJECTS IS BEING DONE BY UC AND SEE A SHOE IS THE SERVER PAYMENT MATERIALS ISSUE. AND THEY'RE DOING RESEARCH ON LONGER LASTING PAVEMENT IF YOU WANT TO SET THAT WAY -- I KNOW CALTRANS HAS ITS OWN RESEARCH -- THAT'S BEEN DONE ON THAT -- IF WE GET PAYMENT TO LAST LONGER. OF THE WEAR AND TEAR OR IS BETTER AND IT IS SOME IMPROVEMENTS SURROUND ON THAT IS -- AN EFFICIENCY. OF CAN YOU GIVE US SOME INFORMATION ON THAT ISSUE. WHAT'S CALTRANS UP TO ON A SURE CENTER WITH THE WHO HAS TO LAST LONGER WE PUT IT DOWN THIS WAY PUT IT SOMETIMES. ONE OF THINGS I THINK WITH A DELEGATION OF THE WORK TO THE DISTRICTS AND DEFINING THAT WORK. THEY'RE STARTING TO LOOK AT THREE QUARTERS AND LOOK AT WHERE IS THE BEST PLACE TO PUT A LONG LASTING PAVEMENT. LONG LASTING PAYMENT IS MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE AND SO WE HAVE TO LOOK FROM A LIFE CYCLE COST PERSPECTIVE MASS TO BE EVALUATED ON INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS BUT WE ARE PRUDENTLY TRYING TO PUT THAT IN THE PROPUESTAS FOR THAT AND SO. THERE'S SOME BIG GAINS ARE COMING WITH THE RESEARCH AUTUMN DAVID. YEAH OKAY THANK YOU -- ANY A GROVE SIR MCGUIRE -- SENATORS THE SENATORS WHO CHAIR IN DEAD YOU WANNA TAKE A MOMENT SAY THANK YOU TO THE CHAIR. FOR ALL HIS WORK OBVIOUSLY WITH SB -- ONE IN ONE OF OUR PANELISTS USED THE TERM GAME CHANGER AND IT'S BEEN AN ABSOLUTE GAME CHANGER SPECIALLY RULE CALIFORNIA -- AND I DO WANNA SAY HOW GRATEFUL WE ARE TO THE WORK OF BOTH AT LEAST IN OUR NECK OF THE WOODS DISTRICT FOR DISAPPOINTING DISTRICT TO CALTRANS. AS YOU LOOK AT THESE LONG TERM LEGACY PROJECTS HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE BE TOUCHED BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF FUNDING AND NOW. THEY'RE FINALLY ABLE TO START MOVING BUILT A WE DO MISS AT MISTER DAVIS IN -- IN DISTRICT -- FOUR IN HIGHWAY THIRTY SEVEN IS STILL HOT MESS SO -- I THINK THE STORM REALLY DID A NUMBER ON AYE WAVE. SEVEN ON EXACTLY -- A LOT OF WORK BETTER PROBLEMS -- AS WE JUST HEARD FROM MISTER SNYDER IS READY THAT FIX IT FROM THE OPERATING ENGINEERS -- RIO. LOOK -- FIFTY NINE BILLION DOLLAR BACKLOG ON IT STATE HIGHWAYS AND BRIDGES SEVEN NINE BILLION DOLLARS LOCAL ROADS AND STREETS -- IT'S GONNA TAKE TIME AND WANT TO BE ABLE -- TO TO HEAR FROM YOU ABOUT EXPECTATIONS I THINK THERE'S A LOTOF EXPECTATION NOW WE HAVE FUNDS THAT THEY'RE GONNA STE THAT FOLKS ARE GONNA START SEEN. PROJECTS FIXED OVER NIGHT I DO WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO AT THE CDC S. CDC REALLY HELPS MAKE IT ALL HAPPEN. IN A TO YOUR TEAM TO MISS BRANSON -- FOR POLAND MAGIC AND A HAT. MANY TIMES THERE'S BEEN A HUGE AS WELL HE'S GOING TO GET TO CLOVERDALE -- CALTRANS. THE CONCERN IN REGARDS TO BEING COMPETITIVE IN THIS HOT JOB MARKET. SO YOU JUST MENTIONED -- ANY OF THE BRING IN INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE PREVIOUSLY INCARCERATED. AT LEAST IN DISTRICT FOUR AS YOU KNOW AND THE BAY AREA. CAN I GET UP FOLKS TO PICK UP LATER LET ALONE -- DRIVE EQUIPMENT -- AND THEY ARE BEING POACHED FROM PRIVATE BUSINESS NIGHT -- WITH BETTER PAY TO LIKE TO GO TO HEAR ABOUT A STRATEGY -- WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE BECAUSE I DO THINK THERE'S SOME? LONG TERM CHALLENGES WITHIN THE RANKS OF CALTRANS OF BEING ABLE TO NOT JUST ATTRACTED TO RETAIN. A HEAVY EQUIPMENT OPERATORS AND OR GETTING FOLKS INTO THE DOOR. FOR AN ENTRY LEVEL JOBS AND THEN WORKING THEIR WAY UP TO THE CAREER -- TODAY. THIS DAVIS THE COUNTER. THANK YOU CENTER YOU KNOW WITH THINGS -- TOOK. DIRECTOR TONY DEVICE PENSIVE IN YOUR NECK OF THE WOODS. IS LOOKING AT DROUGHT BRING IN FOLKS FROM THE EAST BAY AND HIRING THEM IN THE EAST BAY IN TRAVEL IN OUR TIME TO GET OVER THERE TO DO WORK IN YOUR PARTICULAR AREA AS A WAY TO HELP ADDRESS THIS AT LEAST IN THE INTERIM. THAT'S WHEN A MAJOR WAYS WERE DOING THAT CURRENTLY. I THINK AND ALL USE THIS AS A WE USE HIGHWAY THIRTY SEVEN FOR EXAMPLE. JUST THE HEAVY EQUIPMENT THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH A AND I'M NOT PICKING ON DISTRICT FOR KIDS BY THE WAY I THINK. I DISTRICT FOR THEY TRY TO MAKE EVERYTHING HAPPEN AND TRY TO GET YES AND AND SINCERE ABOUT THAT BUT I THINK THERE'S ALSO. REAL CHALLENGES AND THAT IS BEING ABLE TO ATTRACTED THE CURRENT SCALE. OF WAGES QUALIFIED FOLKS TO BETTER DRIVE HEAVY EQUIPMENT THERE'S NO WAY THAT WE CAN CURRENTLY. ON COMPETE WITH PRIVATE WHICH IS NO WAY. I IN A HAS COME UP TIME AND TIME AGAIN ON EMERGENCY PROJECTS -- ADDIS. LONGER LOCAL GOVERNMENT EVEN OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT SPECIALLY COUNTY TIMES LOCAL GOVERNOR I LOOK. NO ONE WANTS. ON GOVERNMENT WORKERS TO MAKE A LOT OF MONEY I SAY THOUGH WE NEED TO FOCUS ON PAY. I KNOW THERE IS A LOT OF CONCERN ABOUT THAT ANY TO SING TIME THOUGH -- WE HAVE TO BECOME MORE COMPETITIVE. AND BY THE WAY I THINK THE TAXPAYER BENEFITS -- NGUYEN UP PUBLIC EMPLOYEES ARE PAID A LIVABLE WAGE SO. LONG TERM PLANS JUST FROM THE PANEL ON THIS BECAUSE I THINK IT IS A IT'S A REAL CONCERN ACROSS THE STATE NOT JUST IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA BY THINK THROUGHOUT THE STATE ENTRY LEVEL. IN BEING ABLE TO RETAIN EMPLOYEES -- WE SIMPLY DO NOT HAVE THE BAND WITH AT THIS TIME WOULD LIKE TO HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT BUT SERRA TO MAKE SOME GREAT POINTS. MS WELL HIGH DIEM A HATE -- MCGUIRE YOU KNOW IT SB ONE JUST. TO SB ONE WHEN WE WROTE IT PUT A FIVE MILLION DOLLARS INTO THE WAR THE STATE WORKFORCE INVESTMENT BOARD. TO LEAD THE EFFORT TO HIRE THE SEVENTY THOUSAND JOBS THAT IS B. ONE CREATED SO THE THE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. QUITMAN OPERATORS ALL THERE'S A WHOLE WIDE RANGE OF JOBS THAT ARE BEING CREATED AND OBVIOUSLY. WE WANT THOSE JOBS TO BE FOR OUR GREAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS NOT. SOMEBODY LIVES IN SOME OTHER STATE WE WANT TO KEEP THE JOBS. FOR OUR OUR RESIDENTS IN CALIFORNIA TO HAVE THOSE JOBS SO SO THE WORKFORCE INVESTMENT. BOARD. THE INVESTMENT -- TRANSPORTATION FUNDS. WAS TO CREATE A UP -- INCREASING THE POOL OF QUALIFIED CONSTRUCTION WORKERS TO WORK ON TRANSPORTATION. AND KEEP THE PAY ROLL IF YOU WANT TO SAY IT THAT WAY IN CALIFORNIA SO. THOSE PEOPLE BE BUYING GROCERIES IN CALIFORNIA NINE TEXAS OR SOMEPLACE I I TOTALLY -- SO THAT THAT'S DEBTS BUT THE QUESTION IS LIKE IF THERE'S SUB -- WE JUST THE NUMBER JUST GOT PUT IN THERE BE HONEST ABOUT IT. I DON'T KNOW IF THE NUMBERS ENOUGH. IT MAY BE THE FOR A SHORTER TIME WE ON INCREASE THAT. AND I DON'T KNOW WHY -- IN TERMS OF A POLICY. MAYBE -- THIS SPECTER GENERAL OR THE TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY CAN AND MAYBE GIVE US SOME ADVICE ABOUT. WHETHER OR NOT WE NEED TO HAVE A INCREASE IN THE LEVEL OF FUNDING FOR THIS JOB TRAINING. ELEMENT. TO GET ENOUGH WORKERS BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH WORKERS SO USERS CAN SLOW THE PROJECTS DOWN. INTO PROJECTS COULD SLOW DOWN THEN THEY YOU KNOW THEY'RE GOING TO COST MORE THERE'S ONE THING YOU CAN DO TO MAKE PROJECTS COSTS MORE. IN A SLOWER PROJECT DOWN. IF YOU INCREASE THE TIMING ON THE PROJECT THE SPEED OF THE PROJECT. THE COSTS LAST SO HAVING WORKERS SAVES MONEY ACTUALLY TRAINING WORKERS SAVES MONEY. IT'S PART YOU KNOW SO I DON'T SOME REQUIRE. YOU YOU NEED THOSE PROJECT EMERGENCY IT'S ALMOST RIGHT TO LEAN IN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I THINK MY BOTTOM LINE IS THIS. I THINK ON THE CALTRANS SITE. THEY NEED TO BE A LONGER TERM STRATEGY ABOUT. HOW WE'RE GOING TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN THE BUDGET -- BECAUSE IT IT IS OF GREAT CONCERN ESPECIALLY ON FOR EXAMPLE WE ARE NOT COMPETITIVE ANY LONGER AND SOME THE CLERICAL ADMINISTRATIVE. WE ARE BEYOND. THE SCOPE WHEN IT COMES TO BEING COMPETITIVE WITH PRIVATE INDUSTRY FOR HEAVY EQUIPMENT OPERATORS. AND IT DOES LEAVE INFRASTRUCTURE VULNERABLE ESPECIALLY ON THOSE EMERGENCY JOBS -- IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO BE TO GET OUR OWN FOLKS OUT THERE -- IN AGAIN I KNOW THAT COULD BE CONTROVERSIAL AT TIMES BUT I THINK -- ESPECIALLY IN THIS JOB MARKET IN MANY AREAS OF THE STATE. WE ARE VULNERABLE FOR NOT PAYING A STATE WORKERS ARE COMPETITIVE WITH PRIVATE ON IN ALSO WANTED BETTER DRIED THE BEST DEAL FOR THE TAXPAYER OBVIOUSLY INTO WHAT IS THAT LONG TERM STRATEGY INTO START TO SERVE. AND TO CARRY ANY ITEM AND ANY THOUGHTS THAT YOU HAVE. YES WELL I MEAN I I THINK WE'D BE GLAD TO GET BACK TO THIS COMMITTEE WITH MORE INFORMATION ON THIS ON THIS TOPIC AND SOME OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS WOULD APPRECIATE IT SO THAT WOULD BE GREAT. WORK ON THE TRANSIT AND RAIL SIDE WE REALLY TRY TO WORK AT THE RIGHT LEVEL OF BALANCING WHAT WE CAN DO WITH THE STATE WHAT WE CAN DO AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND SO SOMETIMES THAT PARTNERSHIP HELPS ADDRESS THIS ON THOSE TYPES OF PROJECTS BUT I THINK ON THE BROADER. ISSUE OF CALTRANS WOULD BE GLAD TO GET THAT GREAT AND THIS IS THE LAST COMMENT MISTER CHAIRS THIS AGAIN AS WELL AS A THANK YOU. TO CALTRANS THEY ARE HUSTLING -- ALL THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND TRYING TO BE A TO GET PROJECTS MOVED. VERY VERY GRATEFUL ALONG WITH THE CDC TO BE ABLE TO GET THE MONEY OUT THERE -- AND DO APPRECIATE THE TEAM WORK -- INTO THE CALTRANS A CREW WERE HERE AS WELL THANK YOU SO MUCH -- AND PLEASE PASS AND THANKS TO THE DIRECTOR.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN VERY HAPPY TO BE HERE -- IS -- RAINING HERE IT'S NOT IN ORANGE COUNTY TODAY WHICH WERE VERY HAPPY ABOUT FOR EIGHT DAYS. AGAIN GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS CHERYL JOHNSON AND THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER FOR THE ORANGE COUNTY TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY. AND FIRST AND FOREMOST THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ABOUT A VERY IMPORTANT TOPIC. IN AS I THINK YOU KNOW OCC IS ONE OF ONLY BRITISH AUTHORITIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- BETWEEN US LOS ANGELES COUNTY OF SANTA CLARA COUNTY. THEY GIVE THIS UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE ON TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS AND PROGRAMS. THAT WE SEE EACH AND EVERY DAY. FOR THE PRIMARY TRANSPORTATION PROVIDER FOR FUNDING PLAN IN IMPLEMENTING COUNTY BY BUS AND RAIL SERVICE FREEWAY IMPROVEMENTS FOR THE OWNER AND OPERATOR OF THE NINETY ONE EXPRESS LANES WERE CURRENTLY BUILDING THE I FOUR OR FIVE EXPRESS LANES. WE MANAGED RETURN ROAD IMPROVEMENTS WE FIND METROLINK RAIL IN WE DO OTHER PROGRAMS AS WELL -- MOST OF OUR PROGRAMS ARE MADE POSSIBLE THROUGH AN ALLOCATION OF BOTH FEDERAL AND STATE DOLLARS AS WELL AS OUR LOCAL SALES TAX KNOWN AS MEASURE RAM. WHICH IS OUR HAVE SINCE TRANSPORTATION SALES TAX. AS IT RELATES TO SB ONE FOR SOME LIKE TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE BROADER PERSPECTIVE THE MAYBE HONE IN A LITTLE BIT ON TRANSIT -- THAT THE BROADER PERSPECTIVE CLEARLY YOU'VE HEARD FROM THE PREVIOUS PANEL ABOUT WHAT THAT DOES AND IT'S REALLY HELPED US LEVERAGE OUR EXISTING TRANSPORTATION DOLLARS INSTRUCTION FURTHER AND MAKE THOSE INVESTMENTS GO LONGER. TO DOUBLE THE FUNDING -- AT THE CITY LEVEL FOR EACH AND EVERYONE OF OUR THIRTY FOUR CITIES IN ORANGE COUNTY AND IT'S FUNDED -- DOUBLED OUR FUNDING FOR THE COUNTY ROAD SYSTEM AS WELL. IS PROVIDED TO STABILITY TO THE STEP WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT FUNDING SOURCE FOR COUNTY TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES. CAN IT'S ALLOWED US TO SUPPORT OUR AND INVESTMENT IN SUPPORT IN THE PACIFIC SURFLINER SERVICE WHICH CONNECTS SAN DIEGO ORANGE COUNTY LOS ANGELES MUCH AS YOU HEARD FROM MISTER ADDISON A MOMENT AGO. TO DATE -- OCD IS EITHER PROGRAM TO BEEN AWARDED JUST UNDER FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND SB ONE FUNDING. IN SPECIFICALLY IS NOT EXHAUSTIVE LIST BUT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS ON THE I FIVE ON STATE ROUTE FIFTY SEVEN STATE ROUTE. FIFTY FIVE WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO PURCHASE NEW TRANSIT BUSES AND MAKE -- IMPROVEMENTS THAT ARE BUT BASS OPERATING BASES WITH ABLE TO DO ACTED TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS AND WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO WORK ON OUR TRAFFIC SIGNAL SYNCHRONIZATION PROGRAM WHICH REALLY I LIKE TO THINK OF THAT IS IS GETTING MORE BANG FOR YOUR BUCK OUT OF YOUR EXISTING SYSTEM TAKING WHAT YOU HAVE. IN MAKING IT WORK BETTER BY LEVERAGING TECHNOLOGY. JUST FOR A MOMENT WHEN A MOVE TO WHAT I THINK IS THE MOST CRITICAL IMMEDIATE BENEFITS THAT ACCRUED TO THE ORANGE COUNTY TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY TO THE BROADER RESIDENTS OF ORANGE COUNTY BECAUSE OF SB. ONE AND THAT WAS THE TRANSIT FUNDING PROVIDED WITHIN SB -- ONE CITY IS THE FIFTH LARGEST BUS OPERATOR IN THE STATE A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THAT WE CARRIED FORTY EIGHT MILLION PEOPLE LAST YEAR. WE HAVE A LARGE BUS FLEET OF FIVE HUNDRED BUSES IN A PARA TRANSIT FLEET OF TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY EIGHT BUSES. PRIOR TO THE PASSAGE OF SB ONE WE HAD WENT IN FRONT OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND TALKED ABOUT 11% DECREASE IN OUR TRANSIT OPERATIONS A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND SERVICE HOURS. THAT WOULD HAVE INVOLVED -- REDUCING PARA TRANSIT SERVICE FIXED ROUTE OPERATIONS SERVICE AND LAYOFFS OF KEY EMPLOYEES -- IN IN OUR SERVICE AREA AS WE FRANKLY TO IT'S GOING. SB ONE REALLY SAVED THE DAY THAT ALLOWED US NOT ONLY. TO KEEP AT THAT LEVEL OF SERVICE IN PLACE BUT IT ALLOWED US TO COMPLETELY REDO HOW WE THOUGHT ABOUT TRANSIT SERVICE IN THE COUNTY AND THAT WAS A MEDIA THAT DIDN'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH. AN APPROVAL PROCESS AT A LATER DATE IT WAS IN THE EXISTING PROGRAM IT ALLOWED US TO KEEP THE SERVICE GO IN IT ALLOWED US TO REPLACE AGING BOSSES AND MAKE INVESTMENTS -- INTO OUR TRANSIT OPERATIONS -- BASIS -- AS WELL. IT ALLOWED US TO BUY ZERO EMISSION BUS PURCHASES TO EXPAND SERVICE ON MAIN STREET BETWEEN ANAHEIM IN COSTA MESA WHICH IS A KEY PART. OF OUR COUNTY -- ININ ORANGE COUNTY. THE TRANSIT FUNDING -- ONE ONE OF THE REASONS IT PROVIDED SUCH IMMEDIATE BENEFIT IS THROUGH THE FOUR SITES OF THE PROGRAM IT WAS FORMULA BASED WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT. BUT IT ALSO IS PROVIDED THROUGH AN EXISTING PROGRAM THAT PROGRAMS THE STATE TRANSIT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. IN IS ALLOWED FOR US TO GO VERY CLEARLY BECAUSE WE UNDERSTOOD THE FUNDING FOR FLEXIBILITY THE REQUIREMENTS THE RESTRICTIONS IN THE METRICS. SO WE COULD PUT THE DOLLARS TO WORK RIGHT AWAY. CONCURRENT TO THAT IT ALSO ALLOWED US TO MAKE PROGRESS ON OUR CORE TRANSIT SERVICE AREA IS PART OF OUR OVERALL A COMPREHENSIVE OPERATIONS PLAN ON THIS BUS. THREE SIXTY WE REALLOCATED SERVICE WITHIN THE WITHIN THIS WITHIN THE COURSE SERVICE AREA SO INSTEAD OF CUTTING SERVICE WERE ABLE TO ADD SERVICE AS A RESULT OF SB. ONE LOOKING FORWARD -- THE FUTURE SB ONE FUNDS WE BELIEVE WILL FOR FLEXIBILITY IN OUR FIVE A PLANNING AND FUNDING EFFORTS -- BOTH FOR CAPITAL AND OPERATING EXPENSES AND THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT AS A TRANSIT OPERATOR. THIS WOULD ALLOW US TO EXPAND POTENTIALLY EXPAND OUR TRANSIT SERVICE IN HIGH DEMAND QUARTERS. OF CORNERS AND SERVE NOT ONLY ARE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IN OUR LONG COMMUNITIES BUT ALSO FOR THOSE THAT ARE IN OUR REGIONAL PLANS IN SUPPORT. GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION REDUCTIONS. IN CONCLUSION I COULD SPEND A BIT OF TIME TALKING ABOUT ALL THE THINGS I STREETS ROADS AND HIGHWAYS BUT I THINK THAT WAS COVERED QUITE WELL -- BY CALTRANS WE WANNA BE SUPPORTIVE OF THEM IN THEIR EFFORTS -- BUT THIS IS HAD A HUGE IMPACT ON TRANSIT OERATIONS MAINTENANCE AND CAPITAL -- INVESTMENT IN ORANGE COUNTY TO THE TRANSIT SYSTEM AND AGAIN WITH WITHOUT THIS DIRECT INFUSION WE WOULD BEEN FACED WITH CUTTING NAY NEARLY 11% OF OUR SERVICE. AYE IN A VERY SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME SO ONCE AGAIN THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE OF CITIES ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE INVESTMENT IN IMPORTANCE OF SB ONE AN ORANGE COUNTY. THANK YOU THANK TO DARRYL A RUNNY **** RUNNING OF THE LEAGUE OF CITIES. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS OF COMMITTEE RIGHT VERTIGO HERE ON BEHALF OF THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES -- THANK YOU FOR HAVING US HERE TODAY I THINK THIS IS A PORN HEARING -- TO HAVE -- AS YOU ALL KNOW THE LEAGUE AND THE COALITION OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT -- BUSINESS AND LABOR STAKEHOLDERS WORKED TIRELESSLY FLETCHER -- AND THE FORMER ADMINISTRATION TO DELIVER -- THE GREATEST INVESTMENT IN INFRASTRUCTURE WE SEEN IN A GENERATION -- I WANT TO THANK CHAIRMAN BELFORD'S EXHAUSTED LEADERSHIP TENACITY ENVISIONED YEAR IN AND YEAR OUT -- INTO IT ALL CAME TOGETHER IN THE FORM OF A SB ONE IN -- TWENTY SEVENTEEN TRIMMING DOWN AND SHERMAN FRAZIER -- HAD A CLEAR VISION EARLY ON THAT A TRANSPORTATION PACKAGE NEEDED TO DO. THREE THINGS NUMBER. ONE PROVIDE RELIABLE FUNDING FOR EVERY MODE OF TRANSPORTATION -- INCLUDING THE STATE HIGHWAY SYSTEM LOCAL STREETS AND ROADS -- PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION CONGESTION RELIEF IN CAPITAL PROJECTS -- NUMBER TO INCLUDE A SERIES OF REFORMS -- TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR CALTRANS A LOCAL AGENCIES ALIKE -- TO ENSURE PROMISES MADE PROMISES KEPT. A NUMBER. THREE INCLUDE CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTIONS -- TO ENSURE THE FUNDS CAN ONLY BE USED FOR TRANSPORTATION AND NOT FOR ANY OTHER PURPOSE -- THESE ARE THE THREE CORE ELEMENTS OF THE OVERALL PACKAGE AND AS SOON AS SB ONE WENT INTO EFFECT -- CITIES ACROSS THE STATE STEPPED UP TO THE CHALLENGE THEIR LIST OF PROJECTS THAT WOULD BE FINDING WITH THE NEW REVENUE -- AND REPORTED WHERE EVERY SB ONE DOLLAR WAS SPENT JUST THIS PAST OCTOBER TO CLOSE OUT THE FISCAL YEAR. WHAT'S THE ONE WHICH CHAPTER IN APRIL COLLECTION YOU REVENUE SOURCES DID NOT BEGIN UNTIL NOVEMBER -- TWENTY SEVENTEEN WITH CITY SEEING THEIR FIRST PAYMENT IN EARLY -- TWENTY EIGHTEEN THEREFORE THERE'S JUST BEEN A BIT OVER A YEAR OF THESE FUNDS -- QUITE LITERALLY HEADING CITY STREETS -- BUT WORK IS BEING FORMED ACROSS THE STATE -- WITH HUNDREDS OF PROJECTS FORECASTED YEARS AHEAD. AS FOR THE IMPACT OF SB ONE THE LEAGUE KNOWS -- THROUGH OUR LOCAL SHE THROUGHOUT THE NEEDS SSESSMENT -- WHICH IS BEEN CONDUCTED EVERY OTHER YEAR -- FOR THE PAST TEN YEARS THAT THE IMPACT OF SB ONE IS IMMENSE. UP INTO OUR MOST RECENT REPORT THE AT FUNDING NEEDS FOR LOCAL SHE TO ROADS. CONSISTENTLY EXCEEDED OVER SEVENTY BILLION DOLLARS THAT WOULD HAVE GROWN BY TWENTY BILLION. IN TEN YEARS ABSENT ANY NEW FUNDING. ON A SCALE OF ZERO TO ONE HUNDRED THE AVERAGE PAY MY CONDITION WAS AT SIXTY FIVE PROJECTED TO SLIDE DOWN TO FIFTY FIVE TEN YEARS. SCORE FIFTY FIVE IN THE CLASSROOM IS AN F. -- WE ALSO KNEW THAT WITHOUT ANY NEW FUNDING. 49% OF THE LOCAL NETWORK WOULD HAVE MOVED INTO AN ACT RISK CONDITION THAT MEANS THE SCORE BELOW. SEVENTY ON THE PAVEMENT CONDITION INDEX. WITH MORE THAN A QUARTER OF THE NETWORK MOVING INTO THE FIELD CONDITION -- WHICH WHICH WE WOULD CATEGORY CRIES AS AS RED -- WHEN YOU LOOK AT LOOK AT IT ON A MAP? WITH SB ONE THAT'S NO LONGER THE CASE -- THE I MET FUNDING THE FOR LOCAL SHE THROWS HAS SHRUNK BY ABOUT EIGHTEEN BILLION DOLLARS OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS. AND THE AVERAGE PAVEMENT CONDITION WILL STABILIZE RIGHT AROUND SCORE OF SIXTY FIVE FOR THE NEXT TEN YEARS -- MOST IMPORTANTLY -- ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THE LOCAL NETWORK WILL MOVE INTO A STATE OF GOOD REPAIR -- OR SCORE BUT SEVENTIES AS CITIES AND COUNTIES FOCUS ON A FIX IT% FOR STRATEGY -- TO MAXIMIZE EVERY PENNY OUT OF EVERY TRANSPORTATION DOLLAR THAT THEY RECEIVE [inaudible] HI. I WANT TO BE CLEAR SB ONE IS A GAME CHANGER AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER -- WITHOUT IT ARE TRANSPORTATION NETWORKS WOULD HAVE CONTINUED TO CRUMBLE -- THERE WAS NEVER AN EXPECTATION THAT A FUNNY PACKAGE WOULD ELIMINATE A NEARLY TWO HUNDRED BILLION DOLLAR -- BACK LOG TO THE STATE AND LOCAL SYSTEM -- BUT WE KNEW SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT WAS NEEDED TO SEND -- WHAT THE TAXPAYERS HAVE ALREADY BUILT? THEREFORE IT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. TO ALLOW SB WANT TO TO DO WHAT IT WAS MEANT TO DO AND TO ALLOW IT TO GET TO WORK -- AND FOR THIS LEGISLATURE TO THINK VERY CAREFULLY ABOUT WHAT WAS ACCOMPLISHED HERE -- INSTEAD OF ATTACHING STRINGS TO THE FUNDING AS I KNOW -- YOU KNOW THERE MAY BE SOME IDEAS ABOUT THAT OUT THERE -- WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT WAYS TO STREAMLINED PROJECT DELIVERY -- BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY TO REALLY ENSURE CERTAINTY THAT THESE FUNDS ARE GOING TO HIT. THE COMMUNITIES. LET'S FOCUS ON ENSURING THAT THERE ARE NO DELAYS TO THESE FUNDS -- AND EVERY COMMUNITIES A TRANSPORTATION SAFETY CONDITION. AND QUALITY OF LIFE FOR PERMITS -- THAT THEY WERE PROMISED BOTH DURING THE PASSAGE OF SB -- ONE AND THE DEFEAT OF PROPOSITION -- SIX SO WITH THAT I'LL CONCLUDE MY REMARKS AND BE AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. OF WILL GO TO PUBLIC WORKS DIRECTOR. FOR THE ARE YOU SEE IT TRANSPORTATION DIRECTOR I THINK YOUR TITLE IS STRICTLY -- CITIES SAN LEANDRO -- MEN LITERALLY ON THE STREETS EXACTLY YES THANK YOU OKAY LET'S GO MAYBE I'LL TAKE A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT PRO T&lt;c.cyan&gt; MY NAME IS&lt;/c&gt; KEITH COOK ON THE ENGINEERING TRANSPORTATION DIRECTOR. FOR THE CITY SAN LEANDRO -- THAT'S IN SENATE DISTRICT. NINE AND I'VE BEEN IN THIS BUSINESS ABOUT TWENTY FIVE YEARS NOW IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR IN TRANSPORTATION. AND I CAN TELL YOU YOU KNOW FIRST HAND HOW NECESSARY AND REFRESHING IS TO FINALLY HAVE A STEADY STREAM. OF TRANSPORTATION FUNDING TO MAKE UP FOR THE DECADES OF NEGLECT ON OUR LOCAL STREETS AND ROADS. YOU KNOW -- RUNNY SAID T IS THIS THESE FUNDS ARE GAME CHANGER -- BUT THEY'RE NOT THE END ALL UNFORTUNATELY AND I I LIKE TO MAKE THE EXAMPLE OF UP FOR LIKE IT'S TOOL. YOU KNOW WE HAVE -- THE LOCAL FUNDING THAT NEEDS TO BE IN PLACE. COUNTY FUNDING THAT NEED TO BE IN PLACE THE STATE NEEDS TO DO THEIR PART. AND EVEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO DO THEIR BOTH SYSTEMS TO REALLY BE. A PUT TOGETHER RIGHT NOW I THINK WE GOT THREE LEGS OF THAT SCHOOL. YOU'LL GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION SO AT LEAST WE CAN BALANCE AND NOT -- YOU KNOW TIP OVER BUT WORK WE WERE STILL WE'RE STILL SHORT. AND IT THE THE THE LAST TIME THERE WAS A STATE INFUSION LOCAL ROADS AND I CAN REMEMBER IT I WAS. TWENTY YEARS YOUNGER AND I PROBABLY UNLESS UNLESS GRAY HERE. PUT BACK IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT AND AND A NINETY EIGHT NINETY NINE AROUND THAT TIME FRAME. AND I WOULD I WAS MUCH YOUNGER OBVIOUSLY I WAS EXCITED AND I SAID WELL WE'RE GONNA MAKE A DIFFERENCE BUT YOU KNOW BEING YOUNG AND REALIZED IT WAS JUST LIKE A ONE TIME INFUSION. AND ALTHOUGH WE PUMPED UP A LITTLE BIT IS STILL STARTED -- TO TO SWIRL DOWN. AND SO. IT'S A IT'S ALWAYS BEEN A CHALLENGE -- AS IT WOULD SEAT FOR THE CITY SAN LEANDRO THESE FUNDS ARE ARE JUST NOW. STARTING TO TRICKLE IN BUT IT'S AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE WORK WERE ABLE TO CARRY OUT. WILL TRY TO GIVE THE FEELING OF THE MAGNITUDE OF OUR CHALLENGE SAN LEANDRO THE CITY ABOUT NINETY ONE THOUSAND SO YOU CAN GET THIS IN PERSPECTIVE. THAT WAS INCORPORATED IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO SO YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT SOME OF OUR ROADS. OUR OUR OLD. AND ALTHOUGH I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT WE NEGLECTED OUR ROADS I THINK THAT OVER TIME WITH STAGNANT REVENUES. AND INFLATION OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN OUR ROADS SLOWLY DETERIORATED ALONG WITH THE ALONG WITH THE ROADS THEMSELVES OVER OVER THIS TIME PERIOD -- WE SAW KIND OF A SMALL RESURGENCE IN THE EIGHTIES AND AROUND THE NINETIES WHEN ALAMEDA COUNTY BECAME A SELF HELP -- A COUNTY. IN THIS KIND OF PUSHED OFF OUR OUR DOOMSDAY A LITTLE BIT LONGER -- BUT IT WAS STILL GOING TO BE INEVITABLE BECAUSE THERE JUST HADN'T BEEN ALL THE ADDITIONAL GROWTH WE NEED IT -- WE RECENTLY -- AT THE LOCAL LEVEL DECIDED TO INCREASE OUR SALES TAX. AND THEN AS PROFESSIONALS AND AS WE REALLY KNEW THAT WE NEEDED TO HAVE A A FIX IT FIRST AN AWESOME PHILOSOPHY AND WHAT WE DID AND SO. IN THE SUBSEQUENT -- COUNTY MEASURES AND SALES TAX LOCAL AND THEN NOW EVEN WITH THE SP ONE FUNDS WE REALLY TAKEN THIS TO TO HEART AND REALLY GONE AFTER -- OUR OUR LOCAL STREETS IN TRYING TO REPAIR THEM -- AND SO -- JUST TO MAINTAIN OUR STREETS CURRENTLY IN OUR IN OUR DISMAL LEVEL OF OF A PCI. FIFTY SIX WE NEED APPROXIMATELY TEN MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR TEN TO ELEVEN MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. SO YOU CAN SEE THAT YOU KNOW THE SB ONE IN THE WHO THE MONEY -- BUT ABOUT 25% OF THAT THAT'S ONE OF THOSE LEGS THAT WERE WERE STANDING ON WE AS A CITY HAD -- TO MAKE SURE THAT WE PUT OUR PARTY IN. AND THEN ALONG WITH THE THE COUNTY FUNDS OF WE ARE ABLE TO TO GARNER THOSE FUNDS TOGETHER AND SO -- THESE LAST YEAR -- AND AND ALSO I THINK THE ONE THING IS THE CERTAINTY. OF THAT THE FUNDS COME IN THAT WE'RE ABLE TO EVEN YOU KNOW TAKE OUT THE RISK AND PUT EVEN MORE OF OUR OWN GENERAL FUND MONEY. INTO THE POT TO TO GO OUT REPAIR SO THIS YEAR -- WE BECAUSE OF A A LOT OF IT WAS FROM -- THE ACTC FUNDS BUT WE DID THIRTY POINT SEVEN LANE MILES OF OF PAVING FOR ABOUT ELEVEN POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS. AND A FIFTEEN POINT FIVE A SEAL WORK AT ABOUT ALMOST TWO MILLION DOLLARS. AND SO. ALL THAT MONEY COMING TOGETHER AT THE RIGHT TIME MAKES A DIFFERENCE AND SO -- WE'RE WE'RE FEELING GOOD RIGHT NOW THAT WE'RE GOING. TO TURN OUR OUR BOAT AROUND IT STILL DOESN'T TURN IT ALL AROUND BUT WE'RE GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTIONS [inaudible] AND ALAA WRAP UP HERE SO -- AS THE YOU KNOW THE SB ONE DEFINITELY WAS -- I'LL YOU KNOW IMPORTANT BILL FOR US AND AND IN I WANTED TO ADD THAT THE MOE COMPONENT I THINK WAS A VERY WISE COMPONENT TO HAVE IN THAT BILL -- IT JUST KEEPS EVERYBODY TRUE TO THE NEEDS OF IT'S OF EFFORT YES MAINTENANCE OF EFFORT SORRY YES. OF OF THE OF GETTING THE WORK DONE THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE AND AND SO I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR MAKING SURE THIS -- THIS WORKING SUPPORT AND TAKE ANY QUESTIONS OKAY. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH KEYS -- THE SAID OF WILCOX IS PENSION FOR HECTOR BROWN AND FROM THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO. VERY BUSY CITY TODAY. OKAY LE CENTRE GO AHEAD YOU HAVE THE FLOOR. THANK YOU A CHAIR BALLOT MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M LISTEN TO WILCOX I MET ON PROGRAM MANAGER WITH THE CITY SACRAMENTO AND HECTOR BROWN OUR PUBLIC WORKS DIRECTOR APOLOGIZES HE SELLS THOSE UNABLE TO BE HERE. AND BUT I'M VERY PLEASED TO BE HERE ONBEHALF OF THE CITY AND ITS PUBLIC WORKS DEPARTMENT -- SO SACRAMENTO IS MAYBE WHERE WE'RE A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE YEAR OLD CITY SO WE HAVE. THE SANTANDER BEAT AB WITH ABOUT HALF TEN BILLION DOLLARS IN INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S BEEN DEVELOPED OVER THE LAST HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE YEARS. THAT WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING THEM AND KEEPING IN A STATE OF GOOD REPAIR -- NOT ONLY A ROADWAY NETWORK BUT OUR BIKE WE SYSTEM ARE TRAFFIC SIGNALS ARE STREET LIGHTS WE HAVE FLOOD GATES. WHICH WERE IMPORTANT AT THIS TIME -- SO WE HAVE A LOT OF THEM NEEDSAND SO I'M GOING OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE. RECORD THIS MAJORITY OF THE CITY'S TRANSPORTATION FUNDING. UNTIL AT WAS HARKEN BACK ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO AT THIS TIME WE ARE WORKING ON THE CITY BUDGET FOR TRANSPORTATION -- IT WAS A REALLY GRIM TIME WHERE OUR TRANSPORTATION FUNDING HAD CONTINUE TO DECLINE -- WE HAD JUST NARROWLY MISSED PASSING A SUPPLEMENTAL. TRANSPORTATION COUNTY WIDE SALES TAX MEASURE AND AND SO WITH OUR BUDGET WE HAD PLANT WE HAD A BUDGET THE PLANNED ON DOING. FOCUSING BASICALLY ON EMERGENCY REPAIRS UNABLE TO DO A LOT OF PROACTIVE MAINTENANCE AND WE WERE LOOKING AT HOW WE'RE GONNA TO FREEZE OUR MAINTENANCE STAFF WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO OVER THE LONG TERM. SO AM AND IN THE YEAR BEFORE SB ONE PASSED WE FILLED TWENTY TWO THOUSAND POTHOLES APPS SUCH AS GIVE ME A SENSE OF HOW WE HAD TO DO SO MUCH EMERGENCY REPAIR. SO IN THE TWO YEARS SINCE HIS PAST A LOT HAS CHANGED -- LIKE MOST COMMUNITIES WE HAVE A IN AND PAVEMENT MAINTENANCE -- WHERE IT ABOUT SIXTY SIX WHICH IS AROUND THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE? BUT AND WE FOCUS ON PAVEMENT AND RUBIO LIKE TO FOCUS THAT IT REALLY DOES NOT ONLY AFFECT JUST AUTOMOBILES. AUTO TRAVEL BUT ALSO OTHER FORMS OF TRANSPORTATION SO OUR BUSES ARE CYCLISTS. NOW OUR SCOOTERS THAT WE HAVE IN OUR CITIES -- AND IT ALSO IS A REALLY GREAT OPPORTUNITY A BLANK SLATE TO READ LOOK AT ALL THE PROBLEMS WE HAVE WITH OUR STREETS -- AND A RECORD FOR THOSE AT THE SAME TIME. SO WHEN WE WHEN SB ONE PASSED OUR FIRST PRIORITY WAS TO FOCUS ON PAVEMENT REHABILITATION -- SO WE TOOK THE FORMULA FUNDS AND THAT THE CITY RECEIVED. IN ADDITION -- AS A SELF HELP COUNTY SACRAMENTO -- RECEIVED -- SOME FINDING THROUGH. ARE SOME S. PRIMULA FINDING. THROUGH THE LOCAL TING IN THE LOCAL TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM -- AND THE REGION AGREED THAT WE WOULD DIVIDE THAT UP. OF PROPORTIONATELY FOR ALL OF OUR MEMBERS AND ALSO TO FOCUS ON A PAVEMENT REHABILITATION AND BASICALLY STATE OF GOOD REPAIR -- WITH A TRANSIT SYSTEM. AND SO WE M.. TOOK THAT AND WE DECIDED WE WERE GOING TO DO -- A SUBSTANTIAL EFFORT SO LAST SPRING AND SUMMER WE WERE ABLE TO CONTRACT OUT ABOUT TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS IN PAVEMENT REHABILITATION PROJECTS -- AND SO THE CITY HAS A CONTRACT OUT ITS REHAB AND HANDLE THE INTERNAL AND EMERGENCY REPAIRS INTERNALLY. AND WE DECIDED TO CONTACT US THIS FUNDING INTO FOUR SEPARATE CONTRACTS FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS -- FIRST OF ALL WE WANTED TO GET IT DONE QUICKLY TO REALLY DEMONSTRATE TO THE CITIZENS THAT THE REVENUE M. WAS HAVING AN IMPACT -- AND SECONDLY WE WANTED TO KIND OF SPREAD TO THE OPPORTUNITY FOR WORK AROUND OUR LOCAL -- AND CONSTRUCTION AGENCIES -- CONSTRUCTION TEMP FIRMS AND WE KNEW THAT CALTRANS WITH INVESTING A LOT IN SOME OF THE LARGER PROJECTS SO. A LOT OF OUR LARGER THAN FIRMS WOULD HAVE A LOT OF WORK WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE WE WERE ABLE TO START GROWING ARE. AT AND SUPPORTING SOME OF THE INDUSTRY THAT CAN WORK ON THE SMALLER AND MEDIUM SIZE PROJECTS -- SO JUST AN EXAMPLE OF THE KIND OF RANGE OF PROJECTS WE DID WITH THIS FINDING THEM BECAUSE SOMETIMES PAVEMENT REHABILITATION DOESN'T SOUND THAT EXCITING BUT IT IS ACTUALLY VERY MEANINGFUL. WE'RE ABLE TO RECONSTRUCT A ROADWAY IN FRONT OF THEM GRANT HIGH SCHOOL SO GRAND AVENUE -- IN ONE OF OUR SIR MAJOR URBAN HIGH SCHOOLS AND THAT FORMERLY HAD PCI OF THIRTY ANSWERABLE TO RECONSTRUCT THAT. AND YOU CAN IMAGINE THE THOUSANDS OF US THROUGH ITS GRAVEL BASICALLY. IT WAS A VERY VERY POOR CONDITION YET THIRTIES SEC THAT'S REAL OPPORTUNITY -- OBVIOUSLY WE HAD THOUSANDS OF OF HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS THEM COMING TO THAT EVERY DAY -- IN THE SOUTH AREA ON MACROS ME MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH THAT WAS ONE OF THOSE RADWAYS THAT WE ARE CONSTANTLY FILLING POTHOLES WE'RE ABLE TO OVERLAY THAT'S THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE TO CONTINUE. TO DO THE EMERGENCY REPAIRS AND WE'RE ALSO ABLE TO BUILD IN SOME BUFFERED BIKE LANES TO MAKE IT SAFER FROM THE TRAVEL -- PROBABLY SOMETHING THAT -- IS PROBABLY MOST VISIBLE IS IN OUR CENTRAL CITY WE HAVE ADOPTED A PLAN TO BUILD. A SYSTEM FOR SAFER AND MORE AND PROTECT LOW STRESS NETWORK FOR BICYCLING PEDESTRIANS TO MAKE IT EASIER TO MOVE AROUND. SO WITH THAT WE WERE ABLE TO BEGIN THAT WITH OUR SB ONE FUNDS DOING A PAYMENT MAINTENANCE AND DEVELOPING A LOT OF OUR OUR CLASS FOR PROTECTED BUFFERED BIKE LANES SO. OUR PARKING PROTECTED BY CLAIMS WHICH YOU'LL SEE ON JAY STREET INTENSE STREET WHERE THE BIKE WEIGHS THE CYCLISTS ARE NOW PROTECTED FROM MOVING TRAFFIC BY THAT THE PARKING LANE. AND WE ALSO GOT ADDITIONAL GRANT FUNDING TO CONTINUE THAT PROGRAM. AND FINALLY AND WHAT WE NORMALLY DON'T FOCUS A LOT OF ARE PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE ON OUR RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS BECAUSE AND THE CARD THAT THE OTHER. ROADWAYS TEND TO HAVE HIGHER THE ARTERIAL COLLECTORS HAVE HIGHER TRAFFIC VOLUMES. AS I SAID WE'RE VERY OLD CITY WE HAVE BEEN RETROFITTING A LOT OF OUR OLDER NEIGHBORHOODS WITH WATER ETERS WHICH REALLY AND TORE UP THE PAVEMENT. AND SO WE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO AND AND REPAVE AFTER THE WATER METER INSTALLATION. ONE OF THE BENEFITS OF DOING THAT AND OUR OLDER NEIGHBOR BUILT MANY MANY YEARS AGO SO THIS IS A CHANCE TO INCORPORATE ALL THOSE ACCESSIBILITY IMPROVEMENT SO THERE'S MOBILITY NOW ALL THE CURB RAMPS ARE IN -- FOR I AM MORE OF OUR RESIDENTS SO THAT'S ANOTHER PLUS. SO -- THAT'S WHAT WE DID THAT AND THAT'S KIND OF A SNAPSHOT OF THE KINDS OF PROJECTS THAT WE'RE DOING -- WE ALSO WERE PLEASED TO GET -- SOME OF THE GRANT PROGRAMS AM SOME ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION AND AND OTHER HIGH PRIORITY PROJECTS THAT WE ARE. WERE LOOKING FORWARD TO DELIVERING NEXT YEAR -- AND ONE OF OUR ONE OF THE I THINK THE TWO BLESSINGS WITH THEM. SB ONE IS IT NOW ALLOWS US TO PLAN AHEAD AND LOOK FORWARD BECAUSE WE HAVE AN ONGOING SOURCE OF FINDING -- BOTH FOR OUR LONG TERM PREVENTATIVE MAINTENANCE AND AS WELL AS LOOKING AT OUR GRANT PROGRAMS AND HOW WE CAN QUEUE THINGS UP. SO THAT AGAIN I WANNA. THANK YOU IT REALLY HAS BEEN A LIFESAVER FOR WHERE WE WERE A COUPLE YEARS AGO -- AND I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY. OKAY THANK YOU WILL KERN TO MARC WATTS FROM -- TRANSPORTATION CALIFORNIA -- MARK. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND COMMITTEE OF COMMISSIONERS ON I'M SO USED TO GOING TO PUBLIC AGENCIES. OF THE MEMBERS OF THE SENATE AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- PLEASED TO BE HERE MY NAME IS MARK WHAT'S ON HERE WE HAVE A TRANSPORTATION CALIFORNIA TODAY WHICH IS AN ORGANIZATION THAT HAS. HAD AS ITS CHARTER TRYING TO ENSURE THE ADEQUATE FLOW TRANSPORTATION REVENUES TO MEET THE PUBLIC'S NEEDS. I'M GONNA TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF SP ONE AS WE SEE HIM. I WILL SAY AT THE OUTSET OF THIS IS NOT BASED ON ANY NEW ANALYSIS HAS BEEN DONE. THE BASIS FOR THIS WAS DATA AND CONCLUSIONS DRAWN A YEAR AGO AS WE WERE IN THE THROES OF DEALING WITH THE REPEAL INITIATIVE. BUT NEVERTHELESS I THINK THE YOU THE THE POINT THAT WAS MADE EARLIER OVER HERE THAT THESE COLLECTION OF THE REVENUES ONLY STARTED A YEAR AND A QUARTER AGO AND THE APPLICATION OF THOSE REVENUES. ON ON A FIRM BASE IS KNOWING THAT IS THE PROP SIX FAILED. HIS HIS IN FULL FLOW AND I WOULD JUST LIKE TO TAKE A SECOND THANK. ALL THE REPRESENTATIVES OF CITIES AND COUNTIES STATE AND REGIONAL AGENCIES FOR DOING A MARVELOUS JOB THE COMMISSION DID A GREAT JOB SETTING THINGS UP. FOR YOU ALL CAME THROUGH WITH THE PROJECTS AND ARE DELIVERING I'M SO. ON BEHALF OF THE INDUSTRY THAT I REPRESENT TODAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SO FIRST OFF -- THIS IS THE FIRST FULL YEAR OF SB ONE BUDGETING RESOURCES WE'RE IN THE MIDST OF THAT -- FIRST FISCAL YEAR OF WHERE WE FOUND A YEAR AGO BEHEADING IN INTO THIS -- INTO THE CYCLE WAS THAT. THE SP ONE WAS SUPPORT ABOUT A HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN INCREASED ECONOMIC ACTIVITY ACROSS THE BOARD. THAT BENEFIT CALIFORNIA RESIDENCES AND BEN AND BUSINESSES. AND OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS THAT WOULD AVERAGE OUT OVER EIGHTEEN BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR -- AS THE LEVEL OF INVESTMENT INCREASES DURING THAT PERIOD SB ONE WILL SUPPORT. AN ADDITIONAL SEVENTY OR SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND JOBS OR SEVENTY THOUSAND PER YEAR OVER THAT PERIOD OF TIME. AND WE ARE STILL COLLECTING DATA AND I THINK WE READING THE REPORT THAT I ALLUDED TO SO WE HAVE MORE -- ABILITY TO TRACK CLOSE MORE CLOSELY WHAT. WHAT THE BENEFITS HAVE BEEN? SOME OF THE OTHER LONG RANGE OF BENEFITS -- THE REPAIR REPAVING RECONSTRUCTION OF OVER EIGHTY FOUR THOUSAND LES MILES -- NINETEEN THOUSAND MILES OF ROAD WAY AND A SEVEN THOUSAND NAY MILES A RURAL INTERSTATES OVER THE NEXT. DECADE WHICH I FIND PROTECT IMPORTANT SINCE I LIVE IN A RURAL AREA. THE USE THE FOCUS OF ATTENTION THERE. OF NEW DISHING DRIVERS WILL SPEND LESS MONEY FIXING THEIR CARS AND TRUCKS. I'LL SAVE AN AVERAGE OF EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR IN OPERATING COSTS OVER THAT PERIOD -- HIT ANY IN ADDITION FIFTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR. IN ADDITIONAL SAVINGS OF SIXTY BENEFITS WERE FOUND. BY OUR CONSULTANTS AS THEY ANALYZE THIS AS CRASH INJURY INFIDELITY WRITES A RATES WILL DECLINE OVER THAT PERIOD -- I WAS GOING TO TALK BRIEFLY ABOUT HOW WE KEY ESTIMATED THIS I'M NOT GOING TO BOTHER WITH THAT BECAUSE I THINK WE'VE ALL LIVED THROUGH ECONOMIC. ANALYSES IN THE PAST BUT TO CONCLUDE -- AS MENTIONED BEFORE. SIX THIRTY TWO JOB YEARS OVER A DECADE. THERE WERE WORKERS THEMSELVES WERE EARNED THIRTY THREE BILLION DURING THAT PERIOD. TECH GROSS STATE PRODUCT WILL BE BILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR -- AND THE THE THAT I'VE MENTIONED THE JOB. RATINGS ONE LAST THING I WANT TO KIND OF PERSONALIZED IS A TOUCH BECAUSE I'VE BEEN USING OLD DATA -- I BY LOOK THROUGH AND SPOKE TO SEVERAL OF THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE PART PART OF OUR PART OF OUR COALITION. AND FIRST OFF -- THERE ARE PRESSURES ON THE INDUSTRY THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY AND OUR LABOR ALLIES TO GET PEOPLE PREPARED AND INTO THE JOBS. I KNOW -- SENATOR REQUIRE WAS INCLUDING TO HOW DO WE FOCUS AT ON THE STATE. THIS INFORMATION IS AREAS IS PRETTY MUCH MORE GENERICALLY BROADLY -- BROADCAST TO NOT FOCUS ON STATE VERSUS PRIVATE SECTOR. BUT THE EMPLOYMENT FOR CONSTRUCTION WORKERS IS IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO GROW FASTER THAN ANY OTHER INDUSTRY. AND THAT'S THE BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS AND THEY THINK. HIM CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT OPERATORS FOR EXAMPLE. THE RATE OF GROWTH WILL BE -- WELL OVER 12% BY. TWO THOUSAND TWENTY SIX SO IT'S PRETTY HEALTHY INDUSTRY. MEDIUM ATTACK MAKIN FROM. GOING TO COLLEGE AND GET THANK. OTHER EVIDENCE OF OF HOW THIS IS TRANSLATING IS OPERATING ENGINEERS. HAVE. AN APPRENTICESHIP APPRENTICESHIPS CENTER. THAT'S GROWING BY LEAPS AND BOUNDS EACH YEAR. OF LABOR'S HAS THEIR PROGRAM GROWING AS WELL AND THE CARPENTERS HAVE A NEW TRAINING FACILITY COMING ONLINE OR STARTING CONSTRUCTION I'M. SORRY -- THIS MONTH IN PLEASANTON SO WE CAN SEE THAT THE EFFORT TO PROVIDE SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE. IS IN MOTION AND I THINK IT SHOULD HAVE SOME -- OF MATERIAL AFFECTS HOW WELL YOU NEED TO DO FOR THE STATE. AND WITHOUT DRAW THAT TO A CLOSE. THANK YOU -- JUST A COUPLE QUESTIONS I THINK FOR THE PANELISTS IN GENERAL -- IN TERMS OF MEASUREMENT OF THE ROAD CONDITIONS AND KIND OF LIKE TO GIVE IT GIVE US A PERSPECTIVE OF WHAT WE NEED VERSES WHERE WE ARE WITH SP. ONE YOU KNOW WE WERE IN REALLY BAD SHAPE RUNNING RUNNING KIND OF GIVE US THE WHERE ARE WERE LITERALLY AT IT'S OF A WATERFALL OF DESTRUCTION I THINK YEAH. AT AVERAGE OF FIFTY FIVE IN TERMS OF ROAD CONDITION LEVELS -- THE AND THEN YOU'RE YOU'RE SAYING WE'RE GOING TO HIT WE'RE GONNA STATE [inaudible] SIXTY FIVE WE'RE WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET BETTER SIXTY FIVE US OKAY BUT IT'S FAIR NOT NOT GOOD. CORRECT. SO -- WHAT IS THE UNFUNDED NEEDS AND? IS THERE -- IS THERE ANY IDEAS OF DEALING WITH THAT ANYWHERE. THAT'S A QUESTION I HAVE. MANA DE YEAH I CAN HEAR YOU -- I THINK HE SAID THE GENERAL FUND OF THE CITY OF SAN LEANDRO. THAT MIGHT NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR EVERY CITY ME. SO GO AHEAD RUNNING SURE SO IN THOSE WITH THE LATEST -- LOCAL SHE TO ROAD THESE SAYS MAY FROM -- TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE LOOKED AT WHAT THE YOUNG FUNDED -- UNMET FUNDING NEEDS WOULD BE WILL BE OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS WITH SB. ONE AND AS I MENTIONED EARLIER IN MY TESTIMONY -- IT CONSISTENTLY EXCEED OVER SEVENTY BILLION BUT THANKS SB -- ONE THAT ON ON MATH FUNDING NEED IS NOW. ON METHADONE FUNDING NEED -- AND I THINK THE REAL TAKE AWAY THERE IS THAT TWO THIRDS OF THE NETWORK WILL ACTUALLY MOVE INTO GOOD CONDITION. BECAUSE OF THE FIX IT FOR STRATEGY RIGHT AND SO YOU'RE LOOKING AT KIND OF GETTING THE BEST BANG FOR YOUR BUCK -- SO THAT YOU'RE NOT JUST RECONSTRUCTING YOU WROTE ALL OVER THE PLACE BUT YOU'RE REALLY FOCUSING IN ON WHERE YOU CAN MAXIMIZE THOSE DOLLARS AND I THINK THAT THAT'S WHY WE SEE. A GOOD A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER A PERCENTAGE OF THAT NETWORK MOVING TO SET A GOOD REPAIR -- BUT THE IMF FUNDING NEEDS WILL STILL -- BE PRETTY LARGE AND I THINK -- MISTER COOK FROM SAN LEANDRO -- ALLUDED TO THIS EARLIER THAT A FEDERAL FUNDING HAS BEEN. HAS CONSISTENTLY KIND OF SHRUNK OVER THE YEARS IN TERMS OF HOW CITIES AND COUNTIES BENEFIT FROM -- FEDERAL FUNDING FOR TRANSPORTATION. YOU KNOW THAT THERE ARE A COUPLE THINGS I DID WANT TO MENTION -- IN TERMS OF WHAT WE'VE ALREADY DONE WITH THE FUNDING IF I IF I MAY. UM IN ACCORDING TO THE CDC'S REPORT -- FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN CITIES AND COUNTIES -- WERE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE THEIR SB ONE SHARE -- THE SOME OF THE PROJECT LISTEN THEREFORE BECAME ELIGIBLE -- BECAUSE THE FIRST FISCAL YEAR WAS ONLY A PARTIAL YEAR WORTH WORTH OF FINDING -- SOME SORT OF THE ONE AND A HALF BILLION THAT WE HEAR ABOUT THE RIGHT GOING IT ANNUALLY TO CITIES AND COUNTIES IS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX MILLION THAT WENT OUT. IN THAT PARTIAL FISCAL YEAR THE FOR THE VERY FIRST YEAR OF OF SB -- ONE OF THAT THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX MILLION A HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX MILLION WAS ACTUALLY SPENT -- ON PROJECTS -- BY CITIES AND COUNTIES -- AND SO THERE WERE ACTUALLY OVER THOU FIRST ROUND OF FIT AND IN THAT FIRST FISCAL YEAR -- AND ANOTHER SEVENTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS -- WAS SPENT ON IN PROGRESS -- PROJECTS AND SO I JUST WANT TO THROW THAT OUT THERE SO THAT -- JUST TO KIND OF HIGHLIGHT THE FACT THAT EVEN THOUGH THE MONEY IS JUST BARELY STARTED TRICKLING IN -- THERE WAS SO MUCH WORK THAT NEEDED TO GO AROUND THAT CITIES AND COUNTIES STARTED SPENDING IT. RIGHT AWAY THAT'S THAT'S HOW MUCH WORK -- WAS NECESSARY SO -- THE MONEY IS GOING OUT AND IT'S GOING OUT QUICKLY AND WE'RE LOOKING FOR TO SEE TO SEEING HOW MUCH MONEY GETS SPENT IN THIS. FULL FISCAL YEARS WORTH OF FUNNY BECAUSE IT'S ONE AND A HALF MILLION VERSUS THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX MILLION SO -- ABOUT FIVE TIMES LARGER RIGHT -- AND SO TO BE INTERESTING TO SEE THOSE DOLLARS GO. THEY ARE COMMENTS ON THE THE BILL OF WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE PREPARING. TO ENTER DEUCE OF A RESOLUTE A JOINT RESOLUTION ASSN CONGRESS. TO DO THEIR SHARE NOW. AND THE PRESIDENT TO THEIR THEIR SURE FOR A NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING. BILL. OF TO PICK UP THE SLACK WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME THE CONGRESS. AND FROM GOVERNMENT INCREASED FUNDING. FOR INFRASTRUCTURE TRANSPORTATION AS A LIKE. TWENTY FIVE YEARS ME. MARK DO YOU REMEMBER A LONG. TIME JAMES SAID KAREN RECALLED SO BEFORE WE DO DECADES YEAH. BEFORE GOVERNOR DEUKMEJIAN. INCREASE IT WAS BEFORE GOVERNOR DEUKMEJIAN INCREASE THE GAS TAX PRIOR TO SB ONE CORRECT. MEANWHILE AROUND AND I KNOW THAT AS I WAS THERE WITH. PRESIDENT REAGAN ACTUALLY -- OF OVERSAW THE INCREASE OF A NICKEL -- INCREASE IN THE EIGHTIES EIGHTEEN CENTS AND WANTED TO EIGHT THE FEDERAL GAS TAXES EIGHTEEN SENSE. AND IT'S BEEN THERE. FOR A LONG TIME. AND THEY HAVE AN INCREASED IT BUT THEY HAVE -- THERE HAVEN'T FUNDED THROUGH OTHER SEEING -- OTHER FUNDING. AT ALL FOR TRANSPORTATION FROM TIME TO TIME DURING VARIOUS OF THE EXTENSIONS THEY HAVE PUT -- OTHERWISE KNOWN AS GENERAL FUND INTO THE INTO THE MIX ARE FUN. NOT ON A SUSTAIN ONGOING BASIS. AND NOT AS A PACK FEEL. LIKE WE NEED TO LOOK AT THAT AND FIND OUT WHAT CONGRESS IS DOING IF THEY COULD THROW SOME MORE MONEY. AND I THINK RIGHT NOW WITH THE SPECIALLY SINCE YOU'RE SAYING. SB ONE HELPED. RELIEVE THE DEFICIT IN ROAD MAINTENANCE BUT IT DIDN'T COMPLETE FUNDING. AND ROAD MAINTENANCE IN THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE DOING HALF CENT SALES TAX THEY'RE DOING. GENERAL FUND ON OTHER KINDS OF WAYS OF FUNDING -- THE GAP IF THEY CAN IF THEY CAN WITH. IS NOT GONNA BE ENOUGH ON A SUSTAINABLE BASIS. KERR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING -- WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT -- DO YOU ALL AGREE THAT WE NEED TO HAVE. OF MORAL BUSTS -- JOB CREATION WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. FOR CONSTRUCTION -- ANYBODY. I BE HAPPY TO WAY AND I THINK A LISTEN TO THE PREVIOUS PANEL ON THE QUESTIONS FROM THE SENATOR ABOUT WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT I THINK IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL AND WHAT MISTER WHAT SAID. MS I MENTIONED EARLIER IS A MULTI MODAL TRANSPORTATION AGENCY WE SEE ACROSS ALL ASPECTS WHETHER IT'S COACH OPERATORS MECHANICS. PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERS PROFESSIONALS IN OTHER PARTS AS WELL AS OPPORTUNITY NEARS IN THE ABILITY TO DO OUR CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES WE SEE THAT AS A REAL RISK AND I WOULD SAY THAT. THAT RISK EVEN GOES UP IN HIGH COST OF LIVING COASTAL AREAS -- AS WE WOULD PUT HERSELF INTO THAT. SO WE'VE BEEN -- ACTIVE IN THAT SUPPORTING APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS APPROPRIATE WE PARTICIPATE A GROUP CALLED ABILITY TWENTY ONE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WHICH IS A PUBLIC PRIVATE -- GROUP AND THAT ALSO HAS A WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE VERY SPECIFICALLY FOCUSING ON OUT MISTER WATCHES INDICATED SO I I WOULD. SAY IT'S A VERY REAL CONCERN AND I THINK IT SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON AT THE STATE LEVEL AS WELL AS UNDERSTANDING THE SUB REGIONAL CONTEXT IN WHICH WE WE OPERATE IN THE US OKAY SUB REGIONAL ALSO NOW. GABRIEL SOME COMMENTS WILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. APPRECIATE WILL GO AROUND OUR LAST PANEL WE HAVE -- SIR REVENUE FUTURE. WE HAVE -- DOCTOR -- A SHRUG ORDER WALL FROM SAN JOSE STATE MINETA TRANSPORTATION INSTITUTE. AND ALLEN JUNE FROM UC DAVIS INSTITUTE FOR TRANSPORTATION STUDIES -- WILL HAVE THOSE TWO INDIVIDUALS COME FOR PLEASE AND WELCOME OKAY. AND I THINK. DOCTOR A AGO WHILE YOUR FIRST AND BELIEVE. ARE YOU DONE [inaudible] STE [inaudible] OKAY [inaudible] YEAR BEFORE. HEY WHAT ARE. YEAH THERE OF A TRY AGAIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE INVITATION TO SPEAK TODAY AT THIS INFORMATIONAL HEARING. I AM HERE REPRESENTING THE MINETA TRANSPORTATION INSTITUTE AND RESEARCH THAT I IN SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE DONE THROUGH THAT INSTITUTE WHICH IS OF COURSE -- ON THE TOPIC OF TODAY LOOKING AT THE FUTURE OF TRANSPORTATION REVENUES FOR THE STATE. AND WHAT I'M GOING TO DO WITH HIS SHORT HAND OUT I'VE SHARED IS JUST I'VE EXTRACTED A FEW OF THE KEY IDEAS FROM TO A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT PIECES OF RESEARCH THAT WE'RE DOING THAT I THINK WILL INFORM. OUR UNDERSTANDING OF WHERE ARE WE GOING ON IF WE MORE OR LESS CONTINUED COLLECTING STATE LEVEL REVENUES AND FEES THE WAY WE'RE CURRENTLY DOING. WHERE WOULD BEAT ME IN TWENTY TWENTY OR TO THE FIRST PROJECT I'D LIKE TO TO BRIEFLY GIVE YOU A FEW HIGHLIGHTS FROM -- WAS DONE WITH CO AUTHORS MARTIN WAX AND HANNA KING AND WE WERE TASKED ON JUST WITH VERY DIRECTLY. HOW MUCH REVENUE WILL THE STATE? BRING IN EACH YEAR THROUGH TWENTY FORTY LOOKING AGAIN AND THIS IS IMPORTANT ONLY AT STATE COLLECTED FEES SO. LOCAL THINGS ARE NOT ON THE TABLE FEDERAL MONEY IS NOT ON THE TABLE. AND ALSO STATE REVENUE SOURCES THAT ARE SPECIFICALLY DEDICATED TO TRANSPORTATION SO SOMETHING LIKE THE VEHICLE LICENSE FEE THOSE REVENUES EVEN THOUGH IT SOUNDS LIKE A TRANSPORTATION TAX AND SHE ARTS SPENT. BY STATUTE DIRECTLY ON TRANSPORTATION SO WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT THOSE -- SO WE ARE LOOKING AT ARE ON EXCISE TAXES ON GAS AND DIESEL -- AND ALSO THE SORT OF INCREMENTAL NEW REGISTRATION FEE THE THE TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENT FEE WHICH SB ONE PUT ON TO VEHICLE REGISTRATIONS AND ALSO A ROAD IMPROVEMENT FEE. ASSESSED ON NINE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES. SO THE FIRST ARM OF THE TABLES -- THE THE GRAPHICS YOU'LL SEE. IS JUST LOOKING AT THESE DIFFERENT REVENUE SOURCES OUT THROUGH TWENTY FORTY AND THE COLORED BANDS REPRESENT THE FACT THAT. ANY PROJECTION IS A GAS AND SO WE'VE TAKE SCENARIOS IN TERMS OF POPULATION GROWTH -- INFLATION AND OTHER KEY FACTORS SO YOU CAN SEE THIS SORT OF CLOUD OF POSSIBILITIES DEPENDING ON A A RANGE OF LIKELY FUTURES. AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THESE COLORED BANDS NOT JUST A LINE AT ANY RATE YOU WILL SEE THAT OUT THROUGH TWENTY FOUR FORTY THE GASOLINE TAX IS STILL BY FAR THE BIGGEST CHUNK OF MONEY. ON AND IF YOU ADD EVERYTHING UP BY TWENTY FORTY I BELIEVE IT'LL BE SOMETHING ROUGHLY AROUND EIGHT NINE BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR IF YOU COMBINE ALL OF THIS. ON IF YOU LOOK AT THE THE BAR GRAPH JUST BELOW THAT AGAIN SHOWS YOU THAT THE RELATIVE PROPORTION. OF NO IF IF EACH YEAR IS A 100% OF THE MONEY THE STATE'S BRINGING IN FOR TRANSPORTATION WHAT PROPORTION OF THAT. IS COMING FROM SAY THE ROAD IMPROVEMENT FEE ON ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES OR GASOLINE EXCISE TAX IN AGAIN IS MAKES QUITE CLEAR THAT. MANY PEOPLE HAVE TOLD US THE GASOLINE TAXES ON ITS WAY OUR ROAD AND IT'S NO LONGER WORKABLE. AND I'M NOT HERE TO SAY WHETHER WE SHOULD CHANGE IT OR NOT TODAY BUT I WOULD JUST OINT OUT THAT IT WILL STILL REYES QUITE A BIT OF REVENUE. INTO THE FUTURE EVEN IF WE DIDN'T CHANGE ANYTHING UNDER LIKELY SCENARIOS. NOW THE NEXT THING IF YOU TURN TO THE FOLLOWING PAGE THERE'S THIS THIS FIGURE THAT SAYS DRAFT ALL OVER IT BECAUSE THIS IS AN ADDITIONAL PRODUCT THAT MY CO AUTHORS AND I HAVE BEEN WORKING ON IN RESPONSE TO A VERY SENSIBLE QUESTION I THOUGHT FROM -- FRAN IN MEN CALIFORNIA TRANSPORTATIONCOMMISSIONER WHO ASKED WELL WHAT ABOUT IF WE HAVE A MUCH FASTER PENETRATE. ON HOW WOULD THAT CHANGE THE PRODUCTIONS LOOKING OUT INTO THE FUTURE. SO WHAT WE ARE DOING HERE IS WE'RE JUST ESTIMATING OVERALL REVENUES WITH SORT OF IF EVEY SALES JUST CONTINUED AT EXACTLY THE RATE THEY'RE CURRENTLY GOING. THAT'S OUR LOW EVEY SCENARIO AND THEN OUR HIGH EVEY SCENARIO LOOKS AT IF WE'D MET THE STATE'S CURRENT TARGETS -- WHICH MEAN BY TWENTY FORTY WOULD HAVE ROUGHLY 25% OF OUR FLEET WOULD BE ELECTRIC. ON THIS OF THOSE OF THOSE TO THOSE SORT OF BLUE AND THE YELLOW LINES THE YELLOW CAN IS THE THE LOW EVEY PENETRATIONS SO. MORE OF OUR CARS ARE STILL RUNNING ON GASOLINE WERE COLLECTING THOSE GAS TAXES FROM THEM AND DIESEL. I'M TO ME STRIKING IS THAT THERE'S NOT ACTUALLY THAT BIG A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE TWO LINES -- I MEAN THERE IS A DIFFERENCE ROUGHLY ONE POINT FIVE BILLION HARDLY CHANGE THAT WILL SNEEZE AT BUT I THINK SOMETIMES THERE'S AN A A CONCERN THAT. WE KNOW IF WE WE IF WE DON'T GET RID OF THE GAS TAX -- IF. IF THE CHANGE IN. A TRACE OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES IS GREAT SUDDENLY WE'RE JUST HOW THE FLEET THAT'S ENTIRELY ELECTRIC IN THERE REALLY WON'T BE REVENUE COMING IN FROM THE GASOLINE TAX. AND ARE ARE THESE DRAFT PROJECTIONS SO THAT NO THERE WOULD STILL BE A QUITE A LOT OF REVENUE COMING IN THROUGH GAS AND DIESEL TAXES -- ALTHOUGH CERTAINLY SOMEWHAT LESS THAN IF IF WE HAD FEWER EASY'S ON THE ROAD. SO THIS IS THE WORK THAT WE HAVE DONE ON PROJECTIONS AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS EITHER HERE OR GO BACK AND DO SOME ADDITIONAL FOLLOW UP IF NEEDED. THE LAST THING I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT S A PART TO THIS IS PUBLIC OPINION ON GAS AND GAS TAXES IN MILEAGE FEES. AND SO -- ANOTHER -- WHICH I'VE DONE IN COLLABORATION WITH DR HILLARY NIXON IS NOW A NINE YEAR ANNUAL SERIES OF POOLS WHERE WE ASK US ADULTS SO IT'S NOT JUST CALIFORNIA BUT ACROSS THE COUNTRY. WHETHER THEY WOULD SUPPORT DIFFERENT VARIATIONS ON INCREASING THE FEDERAL GAS TAX RATE -- AND WE ALSO HAVE A COUPLE OF HYPOTHETICAL QUESTIONS ABOUT IT A MILEAGE FEE. SO AGAIN THESE ARE RANDOM SURVEYS OF ADULTS IN THE US. TO TWELVE HUNDRED OR MORE RESPONDENTS EACH YEAR AND WE'VE KEPT THE QUESTIONNAIRE IS VIRTUALLY IDENTICAL FROM YEAR TO YEAR SO THAT WE COULD EFFECTIVELY LOOK AT TRENDS. AND SO IF YOU TURN TO THE LAST GRAPHIC ON THE FINAL PAGE WHAT WE HAVE HERE. OUR PEOPLE'S SUPPORT FOR A VARIETY OF OF DIFFERENT WAYS WE COULD INCREASE THE FEDERAL GAS TAX IN ALL CASE IT WOULD BE. TEN CENTS HIGHER SO THAT'S THE SAME BUT AT THE BOTTOM WE HAVE OUR BASE LINE WHICH IS WHERE WE JUST TOLD PEOPLE. 2010% TEN CENT PER GALLON INCREASE FOR TRANSPORTATION. AND WE DIDN'T GIVE THEM ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. IN ALL OF THE OTHERS IN THE LOSE OF MOVING UP THE TABLE WE GAVE VARIATIONS SO AT THE VERY TOP WE SAID WELL WHAT IF WE INCREASE THE FEDERAL GAS TAX BY TEN CENT PER GALLON. BUT WE DEDICATED THE MONEY TO MAINTAINING ROADS AND HIGHWAYS. ON AND YOU WILL NOTICE THAT WE HAVE MUCH MUCH REALLY ALMOST DOUBLE THE SUPPORT FOR THAT SAME TEN CENT PER GALLON INCREASE IN THE GAS TAX. IF THE MONEY WERE DEDICATED FOR MAINTENANCE AND SO THAT'S THAT'S ONE OF THE KEY TAKE AWAYS FROM ME IF THIS PUBLIC POLLING IS. BUT I THINK THE PUBLIC A RATHER SENSIBLE THEY DON'T JUST ACROSS THE BOARD REJECT. ANY POSSIBLE TRANSPORTATION TAX THEY THINK ABOUT IT -- YOU KNOW IS IT SOMETHING THAT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO HELP ACHIEVE PRIORITIES THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO ME -- AND I HAVE MANY OTHER THINGS OF COURSE -- AND SO THE THE SORT OF KEY THE MOST POPULAR VARIANTS OF THESE GAS TAX INCREASES IT WE ASKED ABOUT WHERE THE MAINTENANCE -- ONE I JUST MENTIONED ALSO A TAX WITH REVENUE WOULD BE DEDICATED FOR SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS ON AGAIN BASICALLY SUPERMAJORITY SUPPORT. AND AND SOME OTHER VARIANTS IT LOOKED AT FOR EXAMPLE PROJECTS -- TO MONEY TO BE SPENT ON PROJECTS THAT WOULD REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS OR AIR POLLUTANTS ALSO QUITE POPULAR WITH MAJORITY SUPPORT. SO THAT'S AGAIN ONE OF MY KEY TAKE AWAYS IS THIS FACT THAT PEOPLE DON'T TREAT ALL TAXES THE SAME THEY THINK ABOUT IT IN SOME THEY WILL SOME EVERYBODY HATES MORE LESS THAN OTHERS. QUITE A MAJORITY OF THE PUBLIC ACTUALLY COULD SUPPORT. THE LAST FINDING I'LL POINT OUT IS THAT WHAT WE'RE SHOWING YOU HERE IN THIS CASE IS THE RESULTS FROM ASKING THESE IDENTICAL SURVEY QUESTIONS OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS. AND THE THE SORT OF IT IN THE BOTTOM OF EACH SECTION THE THE WHITISH COLOR BAR THAT'S GOING BACK TO TWENTY TEN AND THEN SERVE AS YOU MARCH UP WE'RE GETTING CLOSER TO THE FUTURE. AND IN PRETTY MUCH EVERY CASE FOR EVERYONE OF THESE TAX VARIANTS SUPPORT HAS INCREASED SINCE. TWENTY TEN AND YOU KNOW VERY ROUGHLY IT'S BEEN JUST INCREASE WITH SOME HICK UPS HERE AND THERE BUT IT SEEMS TO BE QUITE A STEADY PATTERN ACROSS ALL OF THE TAXES -- AND WE WE DON'T HAVE OUR TWENTY EIGHTEEN DATA SHOWING HERE BUT IT WAS WOULD HAVE TOO MUCH OF A BOB UP BUMP UP BUT IT WAS THE SAME GENERAL PATTERN NOW I CAN'T TELL YOU OR HITTING A PEAK AND THINGS WILL CHANGE -- NEXT YEAR BUT CERTAINLY OVER THE LAST YEAR'S THERE SEEMS TO JUST BE THIS GRADUAL. MORE AND MORE OF THE POPULATION ACCEPTING THAT THEY WOULD VALUE IMPROVING OUR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM EVEN IF THAT MEANS SPENDING MORE. SO THOSE REMARKS I HAD PREPARED AND ANY QUESTIONS I'LL WAIT UNTIL OF THE NEXT BAKER AND WILL ASK US QUESTIONS OF THE PEOPLE OF KOSOVO TURN OVER TO THE LAST SPEAKER FOR TODAY. HALOGEN IS -- HE'S A RESEARCH SCIENTIST FROM UC DAVIS. AND WELCOME. THANK YOU -- THANK YOU TO THE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE FOR HAVING ME TODAY -- PART OF SB -- ONE HAD A INCREASE IN -- OR INTRODUCTION OF A NEW ANNUAL REGISTRATION FEE FOUR ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES -- AND SO SB ONE PASSED -- UC DAVIS -- WITH STUDYING THE EFFECTS OF THIS PARTICULAR FEE AND POSSIBLE OCT ALTERNATIVE FUNDING MECHANISMS -- AND SO I WAS THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR FOR THE FOR THIS PROJECT WHICH STUDY WHICH WHICH YOU HAVEN'T IN FRONT OF YOU AND PRE FOR VERSION OF THAT AS A AS A POLICY BRIEF COM WHICH IS ALSO PROVIDED THANK YOU -- ONE OF THE ONE OF THE KEY ASPECTS -- AND DRAWBACKS THAT THAT WE ACTUALLY FOUND WITH WITH THE REGISTRATION FEE -- IS THAT -- WITH GASOLINE VEHICLE -- THE THE WAY THAT YOU CONTRIBUTE TO FUNDING ROAD INFRASTRUCTURE IS IS THROUGH THE GAS TAX AND SO THE MORE THAT YOU DRIVE -- THE MORE THAT YOU PAY -- AND WITH THOSE THAT HAVE ANNUAL REGISTRATION FEE THIS DEPARTS FROM THE USER PAYS PRINCIPLE BECAUSE IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU DRIVE A THOUSAND MILES A YEAR OR TEN THOUSAND MILES A YEAR -- YOU'RE NOW PAYING THE SAME AMOUNT -- AND SO FROM -- EQUITY STANDPOINT -- THERE ARE SOME ISSUES THERE. THE SECOND DRAWBACK -- THAT THAT WE USE HAD IDENTIFIED -- WHICH WAS -- BROUGHT UP A BIT AND LOOK IN THE LAST TESTIMONY WHAT CREATION FEE ITSELF IS IS NOT ENTIRELY SUSTAINABLE SO THE AVERAGE VEHICLE IN CALIFORNIA PAYS ABOUT A HUNDRED EIGHTY DOLLARS A YEAR -- AND THE ANNUAL REGISTRATION FEE IS ABOUT HALF THAT SAYS YOU TRANSITION MORE AND MORE TO ELECTRIC VEHICLES YOU ARE SORT OF DECREASING -- THE REVENUE BEING PROVIDED FOR FOR INFRASTRUCTURE -- AND AND WE DO HAVE SIMILAR FINDINGS TO TO WHAT PROFESSOR I ROLL WAS STATING BY TWENTY THIRTY IF WE ME CALIFORNIA'S -- FIVE MILLION -- ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES ON THE ROAD -- THAT'S GOING TO LEAD TO ABOUT A HALF A BILLION DOLLARS IN IN SHORTFALL IN REVENUE -- COMPARED TO WHAT IT WOULD BE THAT THEY HAVE THERE BEEN GASOLINE VEHICLES. OUR IN TERMS OF THE ALTERNATIVE MECHANISMS -- WE IDENTIFIED -- AND STUDIED TO IN PARTICULAR SO ONE IS A FUEL TAX THAT WOULD BE SIMILAR IN OPERATION TO A GASOLINE TAX AND SO -- FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES YOU WOULD CHARGE A SPECIAL TAX FOR LECTURES THE IN FOR HYDROGEN THE SPECIAL TAX REDUCTION -- UNFORTUNATELY YOU KNOW IT IN TERMS OF IMPLEMENTATION THIS CAN BE A VERY DIFFICULT TASK -- PARTICULARLY FOR ELECTRICITY -- WHEN WHEN YOU PLUG IN ELECTRIC THE? IN ORDER TO HAVE THIS A SPECIFIC TAX FOR THE VEHICLE YOU HAVE TO TRACK THE ELECTRICITY GOING IN -- AND AND YOU'RE MEASURING THAT COMPARED TO YOU HAVING ELECTRICITY GOING TO LIGHTS OR OTHER APPLIANCES IS VERY DIFFICULT YOU NEED A SEPARATE METER AND AND THAT IS ALMOST A NON STARTER FOR PROGRAM LIKE THAT BECAUSE IT WOULD BE. WAY TOO EXPENSIVE TO IMPLEMENT A SEPARATE METERING FOR FOR ALL VEHICLES -- THE OTHER -- FEEDBACK IN THIS IN WHICH WE EXAMINE WAS THAT ROAD USER CHARGE OR A OR OR MILEAGE FEE WHICH IS WHERE YOU PAY BY THE MILE AND AND THIS IS ACTUALLY SOMETHING THAT -- CALIFORNIA AND AND CALTRANS HAS BEEN INVESTIGATING -- PARTICULARLY THROUGH -- SB TEN SEVENTY SEVEN WHICH WAS -- A PILOT FOR THAT FOR THE ROAD USER CHARGING AND HAS NOW CONCLUDED -- IN IN WORKING WITH CALTRANS AND AND THE CDC WE ACTUALLY DISCOVERED A A SORT OF UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY THROUGH ELECTRIC VEHICLES FOR IMPLEMENTATION -- OF OF A ROCK -- AND THERE ARE SEVERAL SORT OF BENEFITS THAT COME FROM FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES -- SO FIRST THAT THE TECHNOLOGY INTERMISSION VEHICLES IS IS A LOT NEWER AND WE CAN LEVERAGE SOME THE TELEMATICS SYSTEMS ON BOARD THESE VEHICLES -- TO TO THE IMPLEMENTATION MECHANISM -- OF A ROCK -- AND THAT WILL HELP SOLVE SOME OF THE ASSOCIATE COST ADMINISTRATION -- FOR HARDWARE THAT THAT THAT ARE USUALLY ASSOCIATED WITH ROCKS AND USUALLY THEY USE THAT THESE ON BOARD EXTERNAL DEVICES -- THAT PLUG INTO THE OBD. IN IN THE VEHICLE. AND THAT CAN BE ENTIRELY AVOIDED -- SECONDLY IN IN A LOT OF THE PROGRAMS FOR ROCKS THAT EXIST TODAY MAINLY PILOT PROGRAMS YOU HAVE THIS ISSUE WHERE VEHICLES ARE VOLUNTEERING FOR THESE PROGRAMS PARTICIPATING IN A ROCK -- WHERE THEY PAY BY THE MILE BUT THEN ANY TIME THEY GET TO A GAS STATION THEY'RE ALSO PAYING A GAS TAX WHICH MEANS THEY HAVE TO GET CREDITED BACK -- THE MONEY BECAUSE OF THE DOUBLE PAYMENT WITH THE ELECTRIC VEHICLES -- YOU TO AVOID THIS ISSUE ENTIRELY THIS IS THAT WITH WITH THE VISA AND ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES BECAUSE THE VOLUMES ARE SO MUCH LOWER THAN THAT SORT OF GENERAL POPULATION OF VEHICLES THE TRANSITION TOWARDS THESE -- TOWARDS A ROCK SYSTEM FOR THIS PARTICULAR SUBSET OF VEHICLES WOULD BE MUCH SMALLER AND AND EASIER TO IMPLEMENT. AND THEN LASTLY -- IN IN TERMS OF SORT OF LONGER TERM GOALS -- IF THERE IS A SYSTEM THAT IN THAT IS ABLE TO COUPLE THE TELEMATICS -- AND AND IN AN INTEGRATED WAY -- THAT ACTUALLY ENABLES POTENTIAL FUTURE PRICING MECHANISMS AND SO IN THE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE WE THINK ABOUT THINGS LIKE CONGESTION PRICING -- OCCUPANCY PRICING -- AND YOU KNOW IT IN EACH OF THE SYSTEMS. IMPLEMENTATION IS ALWAYS A CHALLENGE -- AND HAVING EVERYTHING IN IN AN INNER INTEGRATED WAY MAY PROVE TO BE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT ALLOWS FOR THESE -- PRICING MECHANISMS THAT HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE -- AND SO -- IN SUMMARY IN THE REPORT AND WE PROVIDE SOME QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS ABOUT. THE RELATIVE STRENGTH AND BENEFITS OF THE OF THE DIFFERENT -- PRICING MECHANISMS AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE ANNUAL REGISTRATION FEE -- YEAH AND AND THAT CONCLUDES MY MY TESTIMONY AND I'D BE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS -- JUST A COUPLE QUESTIONS FOR THE ACADEMICS -- WHEN WE DID WHEN WE DID SB -- ONE WE STARTED -- THE CONCEPT OF DOING THE RESEARCH TO AID. THE DELIVERY OF SP ONE AND HOW WE WERE. THE CUSTOMER DOING RESEARCH WAS MORE APPLYING IT TO CALIFORNIA. TO TO THE WISE CHOICES THAT WE NEED TO MAKE IN THE FUTURE. AND HAVING SOME BACKGROUND ON OUR OUR BILL EVER ARE IN DE ON OUR DECISION MAKING PROCESS -- JUST -- THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT WHAT YOU'RE TELLING US RIGHT NOW SO WE DON'T KNOW. HOW DO WE DO THAT ON -- WHAT WHAT KIND OF MEANS YOU THINK WE SHOULD DO? ON A CONSISTENT ON GOING -- IS THAT YOU GIVE US REPORTS AND STUFF OF HOW HOW WOULD YOU LOOK AT COMMUNICATING WITH POLICY MAKERS LIKE MYSELF AND AND MY MY COLLEAGUES. IN THE FUTURE ON HOW TO MAKE THE RIGHT CHOICES ON SOME OF THESE ISSUES HAVE ANY COMMENTS ON THAT YOUR YEAH -- SO. SB ONE PROVIDES A A LARGE PROPORTION OF FUNDING NOW FOR FOR SOME OF THIS RESEARCH AND I THINK OPEN LINES OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE POLICY MAKERS AND AND THE ROOF -- IN TERMS OF RESEARCH NEEDS I THINK IS IS CRITICAL FOR THE WAY THAT WE AS AS RESEARCHERS THAT AT LEAST AT UC DAVIS AT OUR INSTITUTE -- THE WAY THAT WE RECEIVE FUNDS IS -- WE WE HAVE THESE IN TURN -- AND THE THE PRODUCTS THEMSELVES ARE SERVE LEFT UP TO THE DISCRETION OF THE RESEARCHERS BUT BUT I THINK REALLY -- CRITICAL WOULD BE -- YOU KNOW. APPROACHES FROM -- THE THE LEGISLATURE AND FROM FROM AGENCIES SUCH AS THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION YOU KNOW COMING TO US WITH SPECIFIC RESEARCH NEEDS THAT COULD THEN BE. YOU KNOW TOPICS THAT THAT COULD BE USED AS AS PROPOSALS -- FOR FOR FUNDING I THINK WOULD BE -- VERY MUCH BENEFICIAL TO SORT OF COORDINATES -- THE NEEDS AND AND WHAT WE'RE JUST TO ECHO WHAT DOCTOR DONE TRANSPORTATION INSTITUTE CURRENTLY DOES COMMUNICATE WITH THE CALIFORNIA TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION WITH CALTRANS ON WITH ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES AND THAT'S BEEN. REALLY HELPFUL IN HELPING US FIGURE OUT WHAT RESEARCH MIGHT BE USEFUL SO I THINK MORE AND CONTINUED SUPPORT LIKE THAT WOULD BE VERY VALUABLE -- AT THE SAME TIME I I THINK IT'S USEFUL TO LEAVE SOME OF THE MONEY MORE TO THE DISCRETION OF THE THE RESEARCHERS WHO MAY HAVE BRIGHT IDEAS THAT. I HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT IN THIS GIVE THEM A CHANCE FOR A TRAINED DEMONSTRATE THAT. AND THEN THE FINAL THING IS I WOULD SAY IN THIS IS IS SORT OF GETS. TO THE WAY UNIVERSITIES OPERATE FACULTY ARE OFTEN NOT. GIVEN THE SORT OF THE FUNDING AND THIS THE MORAL SUPPORT TO GO OUT AND SHARE THEIR FINDINGS WITH THE PUBLIC DOES VERY INSULAR WORLD OF PROFESSORS TALKING TO PROFESSORS WHICH I THINK IS UNHELPFUL -- AND SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THE STATE. AS IT FUNDS UNIVERSITY RESEARCH WANTS TO VERY EXPLICITLY STATE THAT IT IS AN EXPECTATION THAT THE AUTHORS WILL SERVE ENERGETICALLY. SPEAK AT PUBLIC SERVING EVENTS WOULD I THINK BE HELPFUL YES YES WITH THIS AND COMMUNITY MEETINGS AND AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN. THE I I ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH THAT -- ANY NOTION THAT -- THAT NEW WITH THIS MONEY IS IS BEING USED FOR SORT OF NOW PUBLIC GOOD AND AND DISSEMINATING THE RESEARCH AND INTO THE PUBLIC I THINK WOULD BE. VERY VERY CRITICAL. YOU KNOW WHEN IT WHEN I CAME HERE THERE WAS NO REASON. SO WHEN WE PUT SB ONE TOGETHER WE SAID WELL. LET'S FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO SOME RESEARCH BECAUSE WE FOUND OUT THE AND YOU MIGHT KNOW THE STATE'S -- SEVERAL OTHER STATES HAVE MORE VIGOROUS ACADEMIC RESEARCH FUNDED BY THE STATE TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES I THINK. TAXES IS THE FAMOUS ONE THEY HAVE. THE TEXAS TRANSPORTATION INSTITUTE RYDEN. OHIO AND MICHIGAN SOME OF THE STATE SO BIG. I DON'T KNOW BUT WE'RE WE WERE WE HAD WE HAD CREATED THESE INSTITUTES. BASICALLY BECAUSE THE CONGRESS RIDE WITH A CONGRESSMAN MINETA. IS THE IN IN THE BILL HE WROTE CREATED THESE. NATIONAL ACADEMIC TRANSPORTATION INSTITUTE'S ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. AND I THINK CALIFORNIA WE HAVE WHAT SEVEN OF THEM. NUMBER KEEPS SAYING I DON'T KNOW THERE'S A NUMBER. A YEAR TO YEAR TWO OF MY NO DAVIS AND THE NET INSTITUTES AS A STATE. WITHIN THEIR SERVICE I THINK -- OF SEVERAL. SEE ISSUE AND STE AND SEVERAL UC BERKELEY. UCLA AND SO FORTH RIVERSIDE I BELIEVE -- IRVINE I BELIEVE YOU SEE A RUN. FOR A SO SO -- I WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME DISCUSSION OF LIKE HOW WE CAN SUPPORT YOUR INSTITUTES ON ALLOCATION THAT'S GIVEN AND THEN. AND THEN I AGREE WITH YOU THE CONNECTION IS VERY VITAL FOR US IS POLICYMAKERS -- TO LOOK AT THE RESEARCH AND HAVE IT PRESENTED. BOTH BOOKED AT THE STATE LEVEL BUT ALSO AT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ALL THOSE LOCAL GOVERNMENT PEOPLE. COMING UP TO CITY COUNCILS THE PUBLIC WORKS DIRECTORS THE REGIONAL. COVER AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES -- THOUGH CALTRANS -- STAFF MEETINGS PRESENTING RESEARCH TO THE STAFF AT CALTRANS THE WITH THE PEOPLE THAT DO. SERVER THE RESEARCH SO THEY CAN. HELP THEM DO THEIR JOBS BETTER I THINK ALL THAT. FOR THE FOR THE BUSINESS OF BUILDING OUR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM I THINK IT'S VITAL THAT WE HAVE THAT RESEARCH. SO I ALL OF THE WORKING WITH YOU ON HOW TO STRENGTHEN THAT. AND GET IDEAS FROM ANYBODY THAT WOULD LIKE TO COMMUNICATE WITH US -- YOUR ROTOR USER CHARGE US THE QUESTION ON WOULD YOU WOULD YOU CHANGE THE ROAD USER CHARGE RIGHT AWAY OR HOW WOULD YOU GO ABOUT DOING. WELL. IN IN ABOUT THE WELL I BELIEVE CLEARLY STATE THAT -- THE WAY WE TO JUST PUT A HUNDRED DOLLAR REGISTRATION FEE. THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOT. YEAH WELL YOU KNOW IT UNDERSTANDABLY SO I I MEAN CALIFORNIA'S NOW THE TWENTIETH STATE THE HAS IMPLEMENTED A REGISTRATION FEE FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES. IT IS EASY TO IMPLEMENT AND CHEAP TO ADMINISTER RIGHT -- AND FORWARD -- I I I I WILL SAY FOR THE FOR THE ROOT USER CHARGE I THINK YOU KNOW WE WE WE HAVE BEEN WORKING CALTRANS IS WORKING WITH THE WITH THE ROAD USER CHARGE AND AND I BELIEVE THAT THERE IS GOING TO BE -- A PILOT HAPPENING IN THE NEAR FUTURE THAT WILL THERE'S GONNA BE SEVERAL PILES BUT ONE OF THE PILOTS IS TO LOOK SPECIFICALLY AT THIS IMPLEMENTATION FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES -- AND SO YEAH I THINK THAT'LL BE A PROMISE LIST KEEP WORKING ON THAT THAT'LL BE THE WAY AND I KNOW. YOU'RE LOOKING AT DOING ACADEMIC RESEARCH AT THE MINUTE IS -- TO TERMS OF REVENUES CAN YOU KIND OF GO OVER WHAT OTHER KINDS OF THINGS YOU'RE DOING I'M SHORT SO WE'RE GOING TO BE CONTINUING OUR NATIONAL ANNUAL SURVEY WE'RE GOING TO BE STARTING UP WELL. WE'RE DOING A CALIFORNIA FOCUSED TRANSPORTATION SURVEY TO FIND OUT WHAT THE GENERAL PUBLIC THINKS ABOUT VARIETY OF TOPICS AN ESSENTIALLY CAN DO THIS IS AN ANNUAL TREND AS WELL. ON ONE THING BECAUSE I'VE ALSO WORKED OVER THE YEARS THINKING ABOUT MILEAGE FEES IS I KNOW THAT MY ONE CONCERN IS THEY'RE NOT SUPER POPULAR AND SO JUST HAVING. EVEY OWNERS PAY THEM ALMOST CAN SEEM LIKE A PENALTY ON PEOPLE WHO OWN ELECTRIC VEHICLES WHICH IS OF COURSE CONTRARY TO THE STATE'S GOALS OF ENCOURAGING MORE PEOPLE -- AND SO THAT WILL JUST BE SOMETHING ALONG WITH THE MILEAGE FEED. IT OCCURS TO ME THAT WE HAVE YOU EVER MORE ESSENTIALLY CORPORATE FLEETS OF VEHICLES AND DIFFERENT. GUISES WHETHER THAT'S UPS TRUCKS OR LIFT DRIVERS. AND COLLECTING SAY A MILEAGE FEE FROM ALL THESE VEHICLES WHICH ARE ALREADY BEING TRACKED THEY'RE ALL ARE READY YOU KNOW GPS IS TELLING US WHERE THEY GO AND WHEN. AND IT COULD POTENTIALLY BE A MATTER OF THE STATE COLLECTING THOSE REVENUES YOU KNOW FROM A HANDFUL OF LARGE COMPANIES NOT HAVING TO DEAL WITH. A BILL TO EVERY CALIFORNIAN. COULD BE A VERY ADMINISTRATIVE FULLY. EASY WAY TO IMPLEMENT MILEAGE FEES TO SORT OF START WITH THAT PORTION OF THE FLEET. AND ALSO I THINK FROM THE PUBLIC'S PERSPECTIVE I MEAN I PAY MY MY LISTS. THE WHATEVER IT IS I DON'T THINK ABOUT WHAT PERCENTAGES TAXES AND WHAT PERCENTAGE IS GOING TO THE DRIVER AND ALL OF THAT -- AND SO I THINK IT'S JUST A WAY THAT. YOU KNOW JUST GETS WORKED INTO THE PRICE FOR THE NEWMAN MY UPS PACKAGE COMES ARE I TAKE MY LISTER OVERRIDE. SO IT'S NOT I THINK MAYBE AS WORRY. TAX IS JUST PART OF WHAT I PAY I PAY TWENTY DOLLARS A SIXTY DOLLARS OR WHATEVER IF. TO FILL UP MY TANK AND I DON'T WORRY ABOUT BUDGETING FOR THE GAS TAX OR ANYTHING IT'S JUST. IT'S INVISIBLE MORE LAST SO AGAIN I THINK THERE'S SOME. SORT OF POLITICAL AND AND PUBLIC ACCEPTABILITY REASONS WHY THESE MIGHT BE THESE FLEET VEHICLES MIGHT BE A GOOD WAY TO TO BEGIN IMPLEMENTING A MILEAGE. NOW YOU YOU -- JUST SO LAST QUESTION FOR A JOURNALIST PUBLIC TO TESTIFY -- YOU YOU -- HAD A LIKE A A PRIMER ON WHAT KIND OF FACTORS. YOU SHOULD CONSIDER WHEN YOU'RE CONSIDERING FUNDING TRANSPORTATION. YOU KNOW LIKE MAINTENANCE PROJECT IN YOU HAD IF YOU HAD LIKE A PRETTY GOOD. PRIMER. I MEMBER LIKE I'M I'M THINKING LIKE. THREE FOUR YEARS AGO YOU PERCENT OF THIS TO ME YOU HAVE A GOT A COMMUNITY MEETING WE HAD ON YOU WE HAD THE FIRST HEARINGS. IN THE SENATE BEFORE WE START DEVELOPING I THINK THAT FRAME WE'RE JUST LOOKING AHEAD. YOU HEARD THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT PEOPLE SAYING THEY THEY FUNDED PART OF THEIR THIS DEFICIT BUT NOT ALL OF IT SO THEY'RE NOW KIND OF WONDERING. HOW DO WE CLOSE THAT GAP AND HEARD LIKE THE GENERAL FUND WE HEARD ALL THESE DIFFERENT -- I THINK IT I THINK WOULD BE HELPFUL IF YOU HAD. THAT PRIMER APPLY TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO HELP THEM. CONSIDER WAYS OF FUNDING. OF THE MAINTENANCE BACKLOG THAT THEY STILL HAVE BECAUSE THEY OBVIOUSLY STILL. AND WE'RE GOING TO GET A REPORTER THINK FROM THE LEAGUE OF CITIES AND SEE SACK OF BROUGHT THE THE MAINTENANCE BACKLOG HOW TO THE HELL WHAT WOULD BE THE RIGHT WAY TO DEAL WITH THAT AND HOWEVER THE APPROACH THAT ISSUE. I THINK -- PRIMER LIKE YOU GAVE ME FOUR YEARS AGO. ON FIGURING OUT WHAT KIND OF APPROACHES WE SHOULD TAKE ON THE STATE WIDE SP ONE YOU REALLY HELPED I THINK AT THAT TIME. US IN DESIGNING SP ONE I JUST SAY THAT I MEAN YOUR YOUR WORK YOUR RESEARCH HELPED US. DESIGN SB ONE IN A AND I APPRECIATE YOU DOING THAT. THAT REALLY HELPED THE STATE CALIFORNIA. SO -- I DON'T KNOW IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT AND I LET ME -- LOOK INTO THAT IT'S AN EXCELLENT IDEA TO BE HONEST I NEVER THOUGHT OF TRANSLATING ARE KIND OF STATE. LEVEL GUIDE TO THE LOCAL LEVEL BUT I THINK IT WOULD ACTUALLY BE PRETTY -- STRAIGHTFORWARD IN SOME WAYS TO DO AND I WOULD LOVE TO DO IT SO OKAY WE'LL GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT. OKAY -- THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING HERE -- WHAT ONE FOR ANYBODY WITH ANYBODY LIKE TO SAY ANY WORDS TO US AT THIS TIME THE PUBLIC? BY PUBLIC COMMENT. YES COME FROM FORD PLEASE OKAY. YEAH GO AHEAD.
