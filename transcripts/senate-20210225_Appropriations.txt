THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING- CHAIRMAN PORTANTINO AND MEMBERS OF THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE I'M RON MILLER EXECUTIVE SECRETARY OF THE AILING ORANGE COUNTY BUILDING TRADES I'M HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE WHOLE STATE BUILDING TRADES OVER FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND MEMBERS SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND APPRENTICES. AND YOU KNOW THAT'S WITHIN HUNDREDS OF LOCAL UNIONS AND DISTRICT COUNCILS UP AND DOWN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I COME BEFORE YOU TODAY IN SUPPORT OF SB SEVEN. I COULD TALK TO YOU ABOUT ALL THE GOOD THINGS IT DOES FOR WORKING MEN AND WOMEN IN CONSTRUCTION TRADES. BUT I THINK MOST OF YOU KNOW ALL OF THOSE BENEFITS. THIS BILL WOULD REAUTHORIZE AND EXTEND THE JOBS AND ECONOMIC IMPROVEMENT THROUGH ENVIRONMENTAL LEADERSHIP ACT OF TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN. WHICH IS LED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEARLY TWENTY PROJECTS SINCE TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN. AND MANY OF WHICH INCLUDED A HOUSING COMPONENT. WHILE PROVIDING WORK OPPORTUNITIES FOR THOUSANDS OF CONSTRUCTION WORKERS. WITH THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES IN PLACE IN CITIES UP AND DOWN THE STATE IT TAKES FOREVER TO GET PROJECTS ENTITLED AND READY NEW CONSTRUCTION. WITH THAT BEING SAID WE HAVE QUITE A FEW PROJECTS THAT ARE IN NEED OF THIS BILL. TO GET PASSED TO CONTINUE THEIR ENTITLEMENT PROCESS. WE HAVE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS WERE THE WORK AND IN LOS ANGELES PROPER THERE IS RELYING ON PASSAGE OF THIS BILL. THEN WITH THE CURRENT COVERED PANDEMIC DEVELOPMENT AND CONSTRUCTION AS WE KNOW IT HAS BEEN DECIMATED. AND IT HAD A DIRECT EFFECT ON THE ECONOMY UP AND DOWN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. NOT THAT WE ALREADY DIDN'T HAVE A HOUSING CRISIS BEFORE THE PANDEMIC BUT THE CRISIS IS GETTING MUCH MUCH WORSE. THAN THE PROJECTS IN THE QUEUE AND FUTURE PROJECTS THAT ARE PROPOSED WILL HAVE THE ABILITY TO CONTRIBUTE RELIEF. TO THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS AND AT THE SAME TIME BOOST THE ECONOMY AND GET THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY BACK TO WORK. YOU KNOW WE WE'RE WORKING WITH- JUDGE CARTER IN LA. HAVING MEETINGS WITH HIM- THE HOMELESSNESS CRISIS IS VERY REAL HERE IN LOS ANGELES. AND THE WAY TO GET OUT OF THAT IS TO BUILD MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND SO WHEN WE GET THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY BACK TO WORK. WE HAVE ALL LEARNED THAT WHEN CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY THRIVES THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THRIVES. WIRED YOU TO SUPPORT THIS BILL AND MOVE AONG FOR PASSAGE QUICKLY THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER MILLER- THAT CONCLUDES THE TESTIMONY OF OUR PRIMARY WITNESSES NOW WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO- THIS ROOM.

AND WE JOIN THE STATE BUILDING TRADES IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SB SEVEN IS WRITTEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISTER CHAIR I MOVED THE BILL WE HAVE A MOTION ON THE BILL- THERE'S NO MORE PUBLIC COMMENT- THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- MY UNDERSTAND IS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE DOES NOT HAVE A FILE ON THIS BILL. AND WILL NOT BE PARTICIPATING- WILL BRING THE DISCUSSION BACK TO MEMBERS I KNOW MR WHITE HOUSE YOU HAVE A QUESTION. YES I'D I'D I WOULD- I HAVE A CONCERN ABOUT THE FISCAL IMPACT ON THE STATE WE KNOW THAT. THAT THE COURTS HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY PUBLIC JUST LIKE WE'VE JUST HEARD TESTIMONY ON THE MERITS OF THIS BILL ON THE FROM THE BUILDING TRADES BUT WE KNOW THAT THE COURTS HAVE. COURTS HAVE BEEN IMPACTED WE JUST HAD A FOUR HOUR HEARING ON TUESDAY SENATOR LAYERED AND JOINT AND JONES JOIN ME ON THERE'S BEEN NO MOVEMENT ON CIVIL LITIGATION. SO THAT'S ALL BACKED UP WE KNOW THAT THERE HAVE BEEN THE WE'VE DELAYED THE ACTIONS ON THE VACATIONS AND MONEY JUDGMENTS WE KNOW THAT THAT'S ALL BACKED UP TO THE COURTS. IN THIS TO REFRESH EVERYBODY'S MEMORY WE CUT THE COURTS BUDGET BY 10% LAST YEAR SO WE HAVE LESS MONEY AND THEY'RE DEALING WITH COOPERATE SO. I KNOW IT'S NOT NOTHING HI WE ARE AND I KNOW I REALIZE WHAT'S THE CONCERN THE IMPACT OF THE COURTS IS THAT THE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ON. AB NINE HUNDRED WHICH INCIDENTALLY I DID VOTE FOR BUCHANAN'S BILL WITH A- YEARS AGO BUT SOME OTHER MEMBERS ON HERE HE SAID IT'S GOING TO HAVE SOME IMPACT. AND THEY'RE ALREADY BEHIND ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE WHAT THE- THE THIRD BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT SO. I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL IS HERE AND ESTIMATES. BUT WE KNOW WE'VE HEARD. TESTIMONY ON THE MAY. OF THESE. PROJECTS IN THE PIPE AND WE'RE GOING TO. THE HUNDRED MILLION AND REDUCE IT TO FIFTEEN MILLION SO THERE'S GOING TO BE MORE PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE. I ASSUME THE PEOPLE WANT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE- EXIT EXPEDITED- PERMITTING. BUT THAT HAS AN IMPACT ON THE COURTS AND THE COURTS SHOULD BE ABLE TO GIVE US SOME ESTIMATE. ON WHAT LOOKING INTO THE CRYSTAL BALL WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO HIM. PLUS OVER LATE WITH THE DELAYS THAT WE'VE HAD ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE JUST IN GENERALLY IN THE COURTS. BECAUSE THESE FACILITIES ARE NOT. CONSTRUCTED TO DEAL WITH COBIT N. STREET SOCIAL DISTANCING SO. I WOULD ASK IF THE- IF WE COULD IF THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE SAYS WITH THE FISCAL COMMITTEE COULD GET SOME INFORMATION FROM THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL. FOR FINANCE ON WHAT THE ESTIMATE IS BECAUSE IT'S NOT ZERO OR WHATEVER IT IS JUST. LET US KNOW THAT'S MY POINT. REVERB YOU WANT TO ADDRESS THAT OBVIOUSLY THE ANALYSIS ALSO TALKS ABOUT- A PROTRACTED LEGAL FIGHT HAVING. SIGNIFICANT IMPACT AND YOU KNOW CERTAINLY THERE'S CONFLICTING OPINION ABOUT WHETHER THE SHORTENED CYCLE WILL WILL IMPACT GREATER THAN THE LONG CYCLE BUSINESS WIRE YOU WANT TO TACKLE THAT ARE- TO FORGET THAT YOU WANT TO DO IT YEAH I DON'T THINK YOU SO MUCH THANKS. SO THEY LOOK AT IT THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN DISCUSSED- AS THIS BILL HAS BEEN ADVANCED. THE THIS BILL IS A NINETY TO TAKE THE ORIGINAL DEFINITION OF THE ISSUE OF DAYS- SO IN PREVIOUS ITERATIONS OF THIS BILL IT WAS BASED OFF OF CALENDAR DAYS. RIGHT NOW IN THIS ITERATION OF SB SEVEN IT'S JUST STATING DAYS NOT BUSINESS DAYS NOT CALENDAR DAYS WHICH PROVIDES THE COURTS MORE FLEXIBILITY. ON THAT ISSUE BUT AS FAR AS THE FISCAL WE'D BE HAPPY TO BE ABLE TO FOLLOW UP WITH A CENTER Y. CASKEY- ON THAT ISSUE IN AS STATED- IN THE ANALYSIS. FOR CARB AT EIGHT HUNDRED FOURTEEN THOUSAND ANNUALLY WE DO BELIEVE THAT THAT WOULD AT LEAST. BE RECOUP THROUGH FEES- BUT AT BE HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP WITH CERTAINLY CASKEY DIRECTLY IN THE CITY. IF HE'S ON THE CLARITY OF NINE NINE FIVE DID DID CLARIFY WHAT THE DAYS WERE IN THAT WHAT DO YOU LIKE IT OR NOT BUT NOW THE COURTS ARE SPLIT SO THAT ADDS ANOTHER LAYER OF A FISCAL IMPACT ON THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE TRYING TO DECIDE. WHAT WE GET TO CHOOSE BUSINESSES WE'RE GOING TO CHOOSE THOSE DAYS THERE WAS. I MEAN SOMEBODY WAS GOING TO GET. THE LIKE IT BUT WAS THE IT WAS THE- THAT WE'RE TRYING TO GIVE TO THE COURTS BE. IF THE AND- IS THEY'RE GOING TO RECEIVE ALL THESE FAST TRACK. APPLICATIONS THAT PEOPLE CAN'T GET TOGETHER THEN THAT'S THAT'S WHAT OUR CONCERNS WERE SUPPOSED TO FROM THE ARTS PROPERLY AND WE HAVE A WE HAVE COMPETING INTERESTS. THAT IS I KNOW THAT THESE PROJECTS TO JUMP THE LINE BUT I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHAT THAT FISCAL IMPACT IS WORK WITH WITH THE ANTICIPATION. IS ELEGANT I DON'T EVER WANT TO SPEAK FOR THE COURT'S WHATSOEVER AT THAT IS NOT MY ROLE HERE TODAY BUT WHAT I WILL SAY. IS THIS DOES PROVIDE THEM ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITY THEY CAN BE ABLE TO DEFINE THE DAY'S BUSINESS. VERSUS CALENDAR- IN THIS IS WHAT THE FIRST VERSION OF NINE NINE FIVE ACTUALLY HAD IT WAS QUITE GENERIC THAT GAVE THE COURTS. MORE AUTHORITY TO BE TO DECIDE WHAT THOSE DAYS ARE CALENDAR VERSUS BUSINESS AT SO DOES PROVIDE SOME FLEXIBILITY. I WILL ALSO SAY THIS BOOK WE ALL KNOWN ISSUE OF HOUSING WE GOT TO BE ABLE TO GET THESE PROJECTS MOVED RIGHT. WE ARE IN A CRISIS IN THE STATE WE NEED ONE POINT FIVE MILLION AFFORDABLE UNITS BETWEEN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND TWENTY TWENTY FIVE- AND THIS WILL HELP GET HOUSING BUILT. FOR WORKING FAMILIES SO WE'D BE HAPPY TO WORK DIRECTLY WITH- CINEMA CASKEY BRINGS UP A GOOD POINT AND- YOU HAVE- THE COMMITMENT THAT I WILL FOLLOW UP. AND THAT IS THAT YOUR CLOTHES MISTER BARR THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR- FOR THE ABILITY TO PRESENT IN THANK YOU SO MUCH ASKING MEMBERS. THANK YOU- WE ARE I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER COMMENTS WE HAVE A MOTION JUST ONE FINAL COMMENT OBVIOUSLY WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BUDGET THE DISCUSSION SO OBVIOUSLY COURT FUNDING IS SOMETHING THAT IS BEING DISCUSSED. THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS THE CIVIL COURT PIECE I KNOW ALL I'VE HAD SEVERAL MEETINGS ON AND- I DISCOURAGE OBVIOUSLY THE- MISTER REQUIREMENTS TO OUR CASKET TALK OFF LINE AND WORK THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS AND THOSE CONCERNS. WITH THAT MR SECRETARY WOULD YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL WE HAVE A MOTION BY MISTER LEHRER. AND THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE SENATE. FLOOR PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ON F. SIX. BY SENATOR AT. MO IS DEEP.
