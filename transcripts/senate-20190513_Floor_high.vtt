LEGAL ROBO CALLS AND PREVENT

00:53:22.265 --> 00:53:23.333
CONSUMERS FROM BEING SCAMMED.

00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:26.503
WHAT THIS BILL DOES NOT DO?

00:53:26.570 --> 00:53:28.505
IT DOES NOT SIGNIFICANT

00:53:28.572 --> 00:53:30.874
SIGNIFICANTLY EXPAND THE CPU

00:53:30.941 --> 00:53:32.776
SEES AUTHORITY.

00:53:32.842 --> 00:53:34.277
IT NARROWLY ALLOWS THE CPUC TO
