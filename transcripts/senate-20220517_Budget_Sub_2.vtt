REVISION IT HAS A LOT A LOT OF

00:18:46.391 --> 00:18:48.760
ACTIVITIES AND A LOT OF FUNDING.

00:18:48.827 --> 00:18:50.629
FOR IT FOR YOU TO CONSIDER A

00:18:50.696 --> 00:18:52.898
MAJOR INCREASES AS NOTED FOR

00:18:52.965 --> 00:18:54.766
WATER IN DROUGHT FOR ENERGY FOR

00:18:54.833 --> 00:18:57.469
WHAT DEPRESSION ANYA ALL OF THE

00:18:57.536 --> 00:18:59.938
SPENDING IS ONE TIME. ASSEMBLY

00:19:00.005 --> 00:19:01.507
DEPENDING IS FOCUSED ON NEAR

00:19:01.573 --> 00:19:04.076
TERM IMMEDIATE CHALLENGES LIKE

00:19:04.142 --> 00:19:06.078
SUMMER WILDFIRES POTENTIAL

00:19:06.144 --> 00:19:08.747
ENERGY SHORTAGES AB AND DROUGHT

00:19:08.814 --> 00:19:10.516
UP QUITE A BIT OF IT IS FOCUSED

00:19:10.582 --> 00:19:12.251
ON LONGER TERM ACTIVITIES AND

00:19:12.317 --> 00:19:14.920
ISSUES LIKE- YOU KNOW WHAT LONG

00:19:14.987 --> 00:19:16.855
TERM WATER RELIABILITY. AND

00:19:16.922 --> 00:19:18.757
ENERGY DECARBONISATION

00:19:18.824 --> 00:19:21.226
ACTIVITIES ARE SO OVERALL WE

00:19:21.293 --> 00:19:22.394
THINK THAT THE GOVERNOR IS

00:19:22.461 --> 00:19:24.863
FOCUSING ON A REASONABLE SET OF

00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:27.399
ISSUES- THERE'S MERIT OBVIOUSLY

00:19:27.466 --> 00:19:29.201
FOCUSING ON CLIMATE RELATED

00:19:29.268 --> 00:19:32.504
CHALLENGES AS WE SPENT MONTHS IN

00:19:32.571 --> 00:19:35.807
THIS SUB COMMITTEE DISCUSSING-

00:19:35.874 --> 00:19:37.409
THERE'S MERIT. MKE OF A FOCUS

00:19:37.476 --> 00:19:39.244
SHORT TERM A LONGER TERM

00:19:39.311 --> 00:19:40.979
ACTIVITIES AND THERE'S MERIT IN

00:19:41.046 --> 00:19:42.314
REALLY FOCUSING ON ONE TERM

00:19:42.381 --> 00:19:43.815
RATHER THAN I'M GOING FUNDING

00:19:43.882 --> 00:19:45.517
JUST GIVEN FUTURE BUDGET

00:19:45.584 --> 00:19:48.253
UNCERTAINTY. BUT OVERALL I THINK

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:50.255
HER COMMENTS FOR YOU TODAY ARE A

00:19:50.322 --> 00:19:51.523
LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN THEY MIGHT

00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:52.925
BE ANOTHER BUDGET CIRCUMSTANCES

00:19:52.991 --> 00:19:54.259
AND THAT'S REALLY BECAUSE OF

00:19:54.326 --> 00:19:56.562
THIS OVER ARCHING BUDGET

00:19:56.628 --> 00:19:58.430
CONSTRAINTS THAT HAS EMERGEDTHE

00:19:58.497 --> 00:19:59.831
STATE APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT

00:19:59.898 --> 00:20:03.302
YOURSELF- PER THE CONSTITUTION

00:20:03.368 --> 00:20:05.337
THE STATE HAS TO SPEND A CERTAIN

00:20:05.404 --> 00:20:08.240
AMOUNT WHEN THIS. LIMIT IS KIND

00:20:08.307 --> 00:20:10.576
OF ACTIVE AS IT IS RIGHT NOW-

00:20:10.642 --> 00:20:12.477
EITHER ON CERTAIN ACTIVITIES

00:20:12.544 --> 00:20:13.946
THAT ARE EXCLUDABLE FROM THE

00:20:14.012 --> 00:20:17.583
LIMIT OR ON ON TAX REFUNDS SO-

00:20:17.649 --> 00:20:19.785
THE ESTIMATES ARE FOR THE PRIOR

00:20:19.851 --> 00:20:21.286
FISCAL YEAR THE CURRENT FISCAL

00:20:21.353 --> 00:20:22.721
YEAR. AND THE BUDGET YEAR

00:20:22.788 --> 00:20:24.489
BECAUSE IT'S THOUGHT OF KIND OF

00:20:24.556 --> 00:20:25.991
AS A MULTI YEAR ISSUE THAT THE

00:20:26.058 --> 00:20:27.759
STATE NEEDS TO SPEND ABOUT FORTY

00:20:27.826 --> 00:20:29.094
TWO BILLION DOLLARS ON THESE

00:20:29.161 --> 00:20:30.762
EITHER EXCLUDALE ACTIVITIES ARE

00:20:30.829 --> 00:20:32.598
TAX REFUNDS ACROSS THOSE THREE

00:20:32.664 --> 00:20:36.001
YEARS. I AND IN OUR ESTIMATE THE

00:20:36.068 --> 00:20:37.603
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL LEAVES ABOUT

00:20:37.669 --> 00:20:39.004
THREE POINT FIVE BILLION

00:20:39.071 --> 00:20:41.440
UNADDRESSED OF THAT REQUIREMENT

00:20:41.506 --> 00:20:43.575
IN THE BUDGET YEAR TWENTY TWENTY

00:20:43.642 --> 00:20:45.544
TO TWENTY THREE. AND WE REALLY

00:20:45.611 --> 00:20:47.012
STRONGLY RECOMMENDS THAT YOU-

00:20:47.079 --> 00:20:48.780
DON'T PASS A BUDGET THAT HAS

00:20:48.847 --> 00:20:50.649
UNADDRESSED STYLE REQUIREMENTS.

00:20:50.716 --> 00:20:53.952
IN PART BECAUSE WE REALLY SEE A

00:20:54.019 --> 00:20:54.519
BIG PROBLEM LOOMING ON THE

00:20:54.586 --> 00:20:58.256
HORIZON IN BUDGET YEAR PLUS.

00:20:58.323 --> 00:20:59.391
TWENTY THREE. FOUR I WE HAVE

00:20:59.458 --> 00:21:00.759
ESTIMATES THAT THE STATE WILL

00:21:00.826 --> 00:21:03.095
HAVE ABOUT A TWENTY TWO BILLION

00:21:03.161 --> 00:21:03.662
DOLLAR ITSELF ENDING

00:21:03.729 --> 00:21:06.331
REQUIREMENTS. AND A MUCH LOWER

00:21:06.398 --> 00:21:07.699
SURPLUS WERE WERE ESTIMATING

00:21:07.766 --> 00:21:09.968
ONLY ABOUT YOU KNOW ALMOST A TWO

00:21:10.035 --> 00:21:10.702
BILLION DOLLAR SURPLUS TO

00:21:10.769 --> 00:21:13.705
ADDRESS THAT- CLASS. THERE ARE

00:21:13.772 --> 00:21:15.107
SOME VERY CONCERNING SIGNS ON

00:21:15.173 --> 00:21:16.642
THE HORIZON ABOUT A POTENTIAL

00:21:16.708 --> 00:21:18.510
RECESSION SO WE'RE REALLY WE'RE

00:21:18.577 --> 00:21:19.911
REALLY SEEING SOME OUT YOUR

00:21:19.978 --> 00:21:22.347
CONCERNING SIGNS AND THINK IT'S

00:21:22.414 --> 00:21:24.149
A REALLY IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY

00:21:24.216 --> 00:21:25.617
THIS YEAR TO. HEARING FOR THAT

00:21:25.684 --> 00:21:27.719
AND ONE OF THE WAYS TO DO THAT

00:21:27.786 --> 00:21:29.187
IS TO PUT ADDITIONAL FUNDS IN

00:21:29.254 --> 00:21:31.089
RESERVE. TIME AT THE WAY BUT

00:21:31.156 --> 00:21:32.891
BECAUSE OF THIS SORT OF ISSUE OF

00:21:32.958 --> 00:21:34.926
THIS ALEX GLUTAMYL ACTIVITIES

00:21:34.993 --> 00:21:37.429
AND THE NON. EXCLUDABLE

00:21:37.496 --> 00:21:38.430
ACTIVITIES ARE THOSE KINDS OF

00:21:38.497 --> 00:21:39.798
SPENDING THAT COUNT TOWARDS THE

00:21:39.865 --> 00:21:42.334
LIMIT IT DOES SET UP THIS- SORT

00:21:42.401 --> 00:21:44.670
OF INTERESTING AND UNUSUAL AB

00:21:44.736 --> 00:21:46.204
CHALLENGE FOR YOU AS YOU'RE

00:21:46.271 --> 00:21:47.539
PUTTING TOGETHER YOUR BUDGET. SO

00:21:47.606 --> 00:21:49.441
I THINK IN SOME OF OUR COMMENTS

00:21:49.508 --> 00:21:50.709
WE SORT OF CONSIDER THOSE TWO

00:21:50.776 --> 00:21:51.877
CATEGORIES OF SPENDING

00:21:51.943 --> 00:21:53.378
SEPARATELY THOSE THAT ARE

00:21:53.445 --> 00:21:54.746
EXCLUDABLE FROM THE LIMIT AND

00:21:54.813 --> 00:21:56.314
THOSE THAT DO COUNT TOWARDS THE

00:21:56.381 --> 00:21:58.750
LIMIT- AND WE THINK THERE'S A

00:21:58.817 --> 00:22:00.318
REALLY EXCEPTIONALLY HIGH BAR

00:22:00.385 --> 00:22:02.287
FOR THOSE THAT HAVE. THAT COUNT

00:22:02.354 --> 00:22:03.722
TOWARDS THE LIMIT BECAUSE THE

00:22:03.789 --> 00:22:05.724
TRADE OFF IS B. AS- IN PUTTING

00:22:05.791 --> 00:22:07.959
FUNDING INTO RESERVES. SO FIRST

00:22:08.026 --> 00:22:09.895
TALKING ABOUT THIS EXCLUDABLE-

00:22:09.961 --> 00:22:11.663
ACTIVITY WITHIN THIS SUB

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:12.497
COMMITTEE ACTUALLY YOUR

00:22:12.564 --> 00:22:14.266
DISCUSSION IS. A LITTLE

00:22:14.332 --> 00:22:15.367
DIFFERENT THAN OTHERS BECAUSE

00:22:15.434 --> 00:22:17.402
MOST OF THE ACTIVITIES PROPOSED

00:22:17.469 --> 00:22:19.504
ARE EXCLUDABLE MISTER CAPITAL

00:22:19.571 --> 00:22:21.773
OUTLAY- OR EMERGENCY SPENDING

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:23.542
WHICH DOESN'T COUNT TOWARDS THAT

00:22:23.608 --> 00:22:26.578
LIMIT- BUT EVEN WITHIN THAT THAT

00:22:26.645 --> 00:22:28.080
THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU NEED

00:22:28.146 --> 00:22:29.581
TO TAKE THE SAME PACKAGE OF

00:22:29.648 --> 00:22:31.416
EXCLUDABLE ACTIVITIES THAT THE

00:22:31.483 --> 00:22:33.418
GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED. AND YOU

00:22:33.485 --> 00:22:35.120
CAN AND PURSUE SOMETHING THAT

00:22:35.187 --> 00:22:36.321
PACKAGE OF ACTIVITIES THAT

00:22:36.388 --> 00:22:37.989
REALLY FOCUSES ON ON WHAT YOU

00:22:38.056 --> 00:22:38.990
THINK THE HIGHEST PRIORITIES

00:22:39.057 --> 00:22:41.560
ARE- THERE COULD BE ACTIVITIES

00:22:41.626 --> 00:22:42.094
THAT THE GOVERNOR'S

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:44.262
PRIORITIZING- THAT YOU DON'T

00:22:44.329 --> 00:22:46.164
THINK ARE ARE. OUR HIGHEST

00:22:46.231 --> 00:22:47.866
PRIORITIES OR VICE VERSA YOU

00:22:47.933 --> 00:22:49.501
KNOW JUST AS AN EXAMPLE IN THAT

00:22:49.568 --> 00:22:50.869
SENATE MAJORITY PACKET YOU

00:22:50.936 --> 00:22:52.537
DISCUSSED LAST WEEK THERE WAS

00:22:52.604 --> 00:22:54.306
QUITE A BIT OF FUNDING FOR-

00:22:54.372 --> 00:22:55.440
COASTAL RESILIENCE AND SEA LEVEL

00:22:55.507 --> 00:22:57.342
RISE. THAT'S NOT REALLY A LARGE

00:22:57.409 --> 00:22:58.744
COMPONENT OF THE MAY REVISION

00:22:58.810 --> 00:23:00.946
BEFORE YOU SO THAT'S JUST ONE

00:23:01.012 --> 00:23:01.980
EXAMPLE OF A DIFFERENT TYPE OF

00:23:02.047 --> 00:23:03.982
PRIORITY YOU CAN FOCUS ON.

00:23:04.049 --> 00:23:05.817
ANOTHER KEY CONSIDERATION TO

00:23:05.884 --> 00:23:07.152
THINK ABOUT YOUR YOUR PACKAGE

00:23:07.219 --> 00:23:08.720
AGAIN IN THIS EXCLUDABLE

00:23:08.787 --> 00:23:11.289
CATEGORY IS CAPACITY- THERE'S

00:23:11.356 --> 00:23:13.191
BEEN VERY SIGNIFICANT-

00:23:13.258 --> 00:23:16.728
INVESTMENTS. LAST YEAR AND IN

00:23:16.795 --> 00:23:17.696
SOME OF THE MULTI YEAR FUNDING

00:23:17.763 --> 00:23:19.498
THAT WAS APPROVED SO THINK

00:23:19.564 --> 00:23:20.899
ABOUT. ARE THERE PROGRAMS WHERE

00:23:20.966 --> 00:23:22.701
MAYBE THERE ISN'T ENOUGH DEMAND

00:23:22.768 --> 00:23:27.305
DIFFERENT THE AMOUNT. OF FUNDING

00:23:27.372 --> 00:23:28.039
THAT'S PROPOSED MAYBE EVEN WITH

00:23:28.106 --> 00:23:29.374
A MULTI YEAR. KIND OF INCOME

00:23:29.441 --> 00:23:30.742
PERIOD MAYBE THERE ARE ENOUGH-

00:23:30.809 --> 00:23:32.344
PROJECTS A BACKLOG IN SOME OF

00:23:32.410 --> 00:23:33.478
THESE AREAS AND MAYBE. AND THERE

00:23:33.545 --> 00:23:36.047
MIGHT BE OTHER AREAS THAT THAT

00:23:36.114 --> 00:23:36.715
MIGHT HAVE GREATER CAPACITY.

00:23:36.782 --> 00:23:38.250
ALSO THINKING ABOUT- PROGRAMS

00:23:38.316 --> 00:23:40.218
THAT ARE KIND OF NEW AND HAD

00:23:40.285 --> 00:23:42.754
JUST GOTTEN UP AND RUNNING IS IT

00:23:42.821 --> 00:23:43.288
PREMATURE PERHAPS TO PUT

00:23:43.355 --> 00:23:44.322
ADDITIONAL FUNDING IN THERE ARE

00:23:44.389 --> 00:23:45.624
SOME EXAMPLES UNDER THE

00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:47.292
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. I'M FOR

00:23:47.359 --> 00:23:49.394
EXAMPLE THAT- MULTI BENEFIT

00:23:49.461 --> 00:23:50.729
LANDRY PURPOSING FOR THE

00:23:50.796 --> 00:23:52.831
DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION. THE

00:23:52.898 --> 00:23:54.633
STATE PARKS LIBRARY PARTNERSHIP

00:23:54.699 --> 00:23:56.368
PROGRAM YOU KNOW THE THESE THERE

00:23:56.434 --> 00:23:58.503
ARE PROGRAMS THAT SHOW A LOT OF

00:23:58.570 --> 00:23:59.638
PROMISE BUT THEY JUST GOT THE

00:23:59.704 --> 00:24:01.606
FIRST ROUND OF FUNDING SO DO YOU

00:24:01.673 --> 00:24:03.642
WANT TO WAIT AND SEE A LITTLE

00:24:03.708 --> 00:24:05.110
BIT MORE ABOUT DEMAND BEFORE YOU

00:24:05.177 --> 00:24:06.178
POTENTIALLY. PUT MORE FUNDING

00:24:06.244 --> 00:24:07.612
AND- ANOTHER IMPORTANT

00:24:07.679 --> 00:24:09.080
CONSIDERATION IS JUST THINKING

00:24:09.147 --> 00:24:10.549
ABOUT THE MIX OF ACTIVITIES TO

00:24:10.615 --> 00:24:12.551
ACHIEVE YOUR POLICY GOAL SO IN

00:24:12.617 --> 00:24:14.553
THE WILDFIRE SPACE THINKING

00:24:14.619 --> 00:24:16.154
ABOUT PREVENTION- VERSES

00:24:16.221 --> 00:24:17.622
RESPONSE AND HOW YOU WANT TO

00:24:17.689 --> 00:24:20.192
BALANCE. THAT IN THE ENERGY

00:24:20.258 --> 00:24:22.060
PACKAGE THINKING ABOUT HOW MUCH

00:24:22.127 --> 00:24:23.628
YOU THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO

00:24:23.695 --> 00:24:26.565
FOCUS ON POTENTIAL SHORT TERM-

00:24:26.631 --> 00:24:29.534
SHORTAGES. AS COMPARED TO LONGER

00:24:29.601 --> 00:24:31.570
TERM GOALS A PARTICULAR BECAUSE

00:24:31.636 --> 00:24:32.637
SOME OF THE SHORTER TERM

00:24:32.704 --> 00:24:35.440
ACTIVITIES DO YOU HAVE- A KIND

00:24:35.507 --> 00:24:37.609
OF DEPEND ON FOSSIL FUELS. AND

00:24:37.676 --> 00:24:39.211
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS WHICH

00:24:39.277 --> 00:24:42.280
IS A LITTLE BIT COUNTER TO THELONGER TERM GOALS OF THE STATE

00:24:42.347 --> 00:24:43.682
SO THINKING ABOUT HOW YOU'RE

00:24:43.748 --> 00:24:45.817
BALANCING THOSE ACTIVITIES- AND

00:24:45.884 --> 00:24:47.519
THEN ALSO TIMING THIS IS A LOT

00:24:47.586 --> 00:24:49.988
TO DECIDE ON. RIGHT NOW I AM A

00:24:50.055 --> 00:24:52.290
BIG PRETTY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.

00:24:52.357 --> 00:24:54.626
SO IN SOME CASES YOU COULD THINK

00:24:54.693 --> 00:24:55.527
ABOUT ADOPTING AN ARCHITECTURE

00:24:55.594 --> 00:24:57.362
OR FRAME. SPENDING A LITTLE BIT

00:24:57.429 --> 00:24:59.831
MORE TIME OVER THE SUMMER AS YOU

00:24:59.898 --> 00:25:00.966
DID LAST YEAR. ON DEVELOPING

00:25:01.032 --> 00:25:02.834
DETAILS. BUT AS YOU MENTIONED

00:25:02.901 --> 00:25:04.336
MISTER CHAIR QUITE A BIT OF THE

00:25:04.402 --> 00:25:07.339
SPENDING IS SCORED INTWENTY

00:25:07.405 --> 00:25:08.440
TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO- BECAUSE

00:25:08.506 --> 00:25:10.342
OF THOSE SALVOR CHOIR MENTIONED

00:25:10.408 --> 00:25:11.509
SO THAT COULD BE AN EXTRA

00:25:11.576 --> 00:25:13.378
CONSTRAINT- IN SOME WAYS ABOUT.

00:25:13.445 --> 00:25:17.549
HOW MUCH TIME YOU HAVE FOR SOME

00:25:17.616 --> 00:25:18.550
OF THESE AREAS- SO THEN IT'S

00:25:18.617 --> 00:25:20.518
KIND OF SHIFTING A LITTLE BIT TO

00:25:20.585 --> 00:25:21.953
THINK ABOUT THAT NON EXCLUDABLE

00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:23.922
ACTIVITIES SO NOT CAPITAL OUTLAY

00:25:23.989 --> 00:25:26.424
NOT EMERGENCY SPENDING- THAT

00:25:26.491 --> 00:25:28.226
DOES COUNT TOWARDS THAT LIMIT

00:25:28.293 --> 00:25:30.996
AND DOES CREATE A TRADE OFF FOR-

00:25:31.062 --> 00:25:32.397
FOR EXAMPLE PUTTING MONEY INTO

00:25:32.464 --> 00:25:34.966
RESERVES. WHICH IS AWESOME NON

00:25:35.033 --> 00:25:35.967
EXCLUDABLE- AGAIN WE THINK

00:25:36.034 --> 00:25:37.569
THERE'S A MUCH HIGHER BAR FOR

00:25:37.636 --> 00:25:39.371
THOSE ACTIVITIES BECAUSE OF

00:25:39.437 --> 00:25:40.572
THOSE TRADE OFFS THAT COME WITH

00:25:40.639 --> 00:25:43.842
THEM- SO YOU KNOW THINKING ABOUT

00:25:43.909 --> 00:25:46.177
SOME OF THE NEW ACTIVITIES THAT

00:25:46.244 --> 00:25:47.712
ARE PROPOSED THAT. AREN'T

00:25:47.779 --> 00:25:49.581
ALREADY UNDER WAY WHERE THERE

00:25:49.648 --> 00:25:51.416
MAY NOT BE A LOT OF DETAIL

00:25:51.483 --> 00:25:52.684
AVAILABLE THOSE MIGHT BE THINGS

00:25:52.751 --> 00:25:54.653
YOU MIGHT WANT TO THINK EVEN IF

00:25:54.719 --> 00:25:56.321
THEY SEEM LIKE THEY HAVE SOME

00:25:56.388 --> 00:25:57.889
AMERICAN CONCEPT YOU MIGHT WANT

00:25:57.956 --> 00:26:02.527
TO THINK ABOUT. NOTED SOME OF

00:26:02.594 --> 00:26:04.129
THE REALLY BIG NEW IDEAS

00:26:04.195 --> 00:26:05.330
PROPOSED ARE AT CLIMATE

00:26:05.397 --> 00:26:07.599
INNOVATION GRANTS. M. AND THEN

00:26:07.666 --> 00:26:08.767
ALSO SOME OF THE CALIFORNIA

00:26:08.833 --> 00:26:10.969
ADMIN PROPOSALS WHICH ARE ARE

00:26:11.036 --> 00:26:14.506
ARE NEW- AND AGAIN EVEN WITHIN

00:26:14.572 --> 00:26:15.807
THIS NON X. LITTLE ACTIVITY

00:26:15.874 --> 00:26:17.008
REALLY THINKING ABOUT WHAT ARE

00:26:17.075 --> 00:26:18.910
THE HIGHEST PRIORITIES IF YOU

00:26:18.977 --> 00:26:20.545
HAVE MOST OF THE WILDFIRE

00:26:20.612 --> 00:26:23.815
SPENDING. IS NON EXCLUDABLE YOU

00:26:23.882 --> 00:26:25.450
PROBABLY ARE GOING TO WANT TO DO

00:26:25.517 --> 00:26:27.619
SOME OF THAT BUT THINKING ABOUT

00:26:27.686 --> 00:26:28.286
THE MIX OF PREVENTION AND

00:26:28.353 --> 00:26:30.221
RESPONSE AND WHAT ARE THE

00:26:30.288 --> 00:26:30.855
HIGHEST PRIORITIES I AM ALSO

00:26:30.922 --> 00:26:32.590
THINKING ABOUT ONE TIME AND

00:26:32.657 --> 00:26:33.591
ONGOING- WHERE THERE ARE SOME OF

00:26:33.658 --> 00:26:35.060
THESE ONGOING PROPOSALS IS THAT

00:26:35.126 --> 00:26:36.194
SOMETHING YOU REALLY WANT TO

VOTERS IN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE

00:33:04.248 --> 00:33:08.186
BUT JUST THIS EMERGING- AB STATE

APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT OR SELF

00:33:09.454 --> 00:33:11.189
CONSTRAINT WHERE IT REQUIRES

00:33:11.255 --> 00:33:13.458
THAT A CERTAIN PORTION ARE AND

00:33:13.524 --> 00:33:15.326
NOW DEFENDING THERE'S A LINK TO

00:33:15.393 --> 00:33:17.895
THE AMOUNT OF REVENUES THAT ARE

00:33:17.962 --> 00:33:19.263
RAISED- EITHER BEING. SPENT ON

00:33:19.330 --> 00:33:21.099
THESE EXCLUDABLE PURPOSES OR OR

00:33:21.165 --> 00:33:23.534
GIVEN BACK AS TAX REFUNDS AND

00:33:23.601 --> 00:33:26.371
WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO HANDLE THAT-

00:33:26.437 --> 00:33:28.072
OR ADDRESS THAT IN THE MOST

00:33:28.139 --> 00:33:29.807
RECENT YEARS BECAUSE OF THIS

00:33:29.874 --> 00:33:31.642
REALLY UNPRECEDENTED SURPLUS.

00:33:31.709 --> 00:33:33.711
THAT WE HAVE KIND OF THIS SORT

00:33:33.778 --> 00:33:36.180
OF. A FINDING THAT IS THAT IS

00:33:36.247 --> 00:33:38.082
NOT DEDICATED TO OUR ON GOING

00:33:38.149 --> 00:33:39.751
EXISTING PROGRAMS THAT CAN

00:33:39.817 --> 00:33:42.186
INSTEAD BE AB DIRECTED TO

00:33:42.253 --> 00:33:44.489
ADDRESS THIS- THESE THESE

00:33:44.555 --> 00:33:46.457
REQUIREMENTS. ARE BUT AS WE'RE

00:33:46.524 --> 00:33:48.192
LOOKING AT HAD YOU KNOW WE'RE

00:33:48.259 --> 00:33:49.894
NOT WE'RE NOT FORECASTING THAT

00:33:49.961 --> 00:33:51.662
LEVEL OF SURPLUS TO CONTINUALLY

00:33:51.729 --> 00:33:53.998
REALLY DIDN'T SEE IT AS AS KIND

00:33:54.065 --> 00:33:57.368
OF AN UNEXPECTED UNANTICIPATED-

00:33:57.435 --> 00:34:00.805
LARGE ONE TIME WINDFALL AND SO.

00:34:00.872 --> 00:34:02.807
WHEN HAVING THESE CONSTRAINTS

00:34:02.874 --> 00:34:04.275
AND THESE REQUIREMENTS FOR A

00:34:04.342 --> 00:34:06.244
CERTAIN TYPE OF SPENDING WITHOUT

00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:10.214
THAT- OKAY UNACCOUNTED FOR.

00:34:10.281 --> 00:34:13.317
EXTRA FEW WELL FUNDING MEANS

00:34:13.384 --> 00:34:15.953
THAT WE EITHER NEED TO COME UP

00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:18.456
WITH A FUNDING ELSEWHERE- YOU

00:34:18.523 --> 00:34:20.758
KNOW FROM RESERVES WITH IS

00:34:20.825 --> 00:34:23.027
OBVIOUSLY THE LEAST IMPACTFUL OR

00:34:23.094 --> 00:34:25.062
LOOK INTO BASED PROGRAMMING SO

00:34:25.129 --> 00:34:28.933
IT IS IT IS A NEW. CONSTRAINTS

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.336
AND- ARCHITECTURE SITUATION THAT

00:34:32.403 --> 00:34:33.604
THE BUDGET HAS TO DEAL WITH THAT

00:34:33.671 --> 00:34:36.407
IS THAT HASN'T BEEN IN THE PAST-

00:34:36.474 --> 00:34:38.309
SO THAT'S ONE SET OF CONCERNS

00:34:38.376 --> 00:34:40.144
AND THEN THE OTHER IS THERE ARE

00:34:40.211 --> 00:34:41.712
AGAIN PRETTY PRETTY CONCERNING

00:34:41.779 --> 00:34:45.516
SIGNS OF A POTENTIAL RECESSION-

00:34:45.583 --> 00:34:47.318
KIND OF ON THE HORIZON. WHICH

00:34:47.385 --> 00:34:48.586
WOULD ALSO COMPLICATE THINGS IF

00:34:48.653 --> 00:34:50.455
WE IF WE HAVE LESS REVENUE OF

00:34:50.521 --> 00:34:51.756
COURSE IF WE HAVE LESS REVENUE

00:34:51.823 --> 00:34:53.624
IT ALSO MEANS THAT ARE SELF

00:34:53.691 --> 00:34:54.459
FUNDING REQUIREMENTS BUT DOWN SO

00:34:54.525 --> 00:34:57.295
THAT HELPS A LITTLE BIT IN THAT

00:34:57.361 --> 00:34:59.530
AREA BUT- YOU KNOW A LOT OF A

00:34:59.597 --> 00:35:00.798
LOT OF UNCERTAINTY I THINK.

00:35:00.865 --> 00:35:02.967
SPENDING AND SO I THINK. PART OF

00:35:03.034 --> 00:35:04.168
OUR BIG MESSAGE IS OBVIOUSLY YOU

00:51:19.609 --> 00:51:20.844
OUR DEMAND SIDE AS WELL AS

00:51:20.911 --> 00:51:23.647
SUPPLY SIDE. SO WE ARE DOING.

00:51:23.713 --> 00:51:25.482
EVERYTHING WE CAN IN TERMS OF

00:51:25.549 --> 00:51:27.384
UNDERSTANDING THE RISK I TO

00:51:27.451 --> 00:51:30.020
DEMAND. AS WELL AS SUPPLY AS WE

00:51:30.086 --> 00:51:32.522
PLAN TO THE NEXT. FIVE YEARS THE

00:51:32.589 --> 00:51:33.990
FIRST STEP ABOUT THIS IS STILL

00:51:34.057 --> 00:51:35.725
DOING ADEQUATE PLANNING TAKING

00:51:35.792 --> 00:51:36.259
ALL OF THOSE THINGS INTO

00:51:36.326 --> 00:51:38.695
ACCOUNT. AND ENSURING ENOUGH

00:51:38.762 --> 00:51:40.564
PROCUREMENT HAVE BEEN OPTIMIZED

00:51:40.630 --> 00:51:43.533
REPORTS THAT. SECOND TEMPLE THAT

00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:45.268
WOULD BE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

00:51:45.335 --> 00:51:46.837
AUTHORIZED PROCUREMENT IS

00:51:46.903 --> 00:51:48.405
ACTUALLY BEING BILLED IN A

00:51:48.472 --> 00:51:51.241
TIMELY FASHION. AND FINALLY THE

00:51:51.308 --> 00:51:52.742
THIRD PART OF IT IS ACTUALLY

00:51:52.809 --> 00:51:54.711
GOING TO A PARTICULAR SUMMER. WE

00:51:54.778 --> 00:51:57.647
LOOK AT- WHAT IF WHAT IS ON THE

00:51:57.714 --> 00:51:58.381
HORIZON OVER THE NEXT SIX

00:51:58.448 --> 00:52:01.084
MONTHS. AND THINK THROUGH WHAT

00:52:01.151 --> 00:52:03.820
EXTRAORDINARY- MEASURES SHOULD

00:52:03.887 --> 00:52:05.422
BE TAKEN IN ORDER TO TAKE YOUR

00:52:05.489 --> 00:52:07.357
ADDED THAT A LIABILITY AND IN

00:52:07.424 --> 00:52:08.925
THE SHORT TERM. ON THE PLANNING

00:52:08.992 --> 00:52:10.627
AND PROCUREMENT OPERATING OF THE

00:52:10.694 --> 00:52:13.997
PROCUREMENT PART. WE HAVE DONE A

00:52:14.064 --> 00:52:15.599
NUMBER OF. THE STATE HAS TAKEN A

00:52:15.665 --> 00:52:17.400
NUMBER OF DIFFERENT ACTIONS. IN

00:52:17.467 --> 00:52:18.468
TERMS OF PLANNING FOR CERTAIN

00:52:18.535 --> 00:52:20.270
LEVELS OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND

00:52:20.337 --> 00:52:23.139
AUTOMATING PROCUREMENT- SO IF

00:52:23.206 --> 00:52:32.148
YOU HAVE AUTHORIZED- A LARGE

00:52:32.215 --> 00:52:33.383
AMOUNT APPROACH GOVERNMENT I

00:52:33.450 --> 00:52:34.885
ALMOST FIVE THOUSAND. MEGAWATTS

00:52:34.951 --> 00:52:36.553
OF NEW. OUT COMMUNITIES. TO

00:52:36.620 --> 00:52:37.821
SUPPORT THE GRADE TAKING INTO

00:52:37.888 --> 00:52:39.289
ACCOUNT- THE LAY BUT THAT IT

00:52:39.356 --> 00:52:40.790
TOOK. THAT YOU AMEND. AND THEN

00:52:40.857 --> 00:52:42.726
WE- YOU KNOW AS WE LOOK THROUGH.

00:52:42.792 --> 00:52:44.427
THAT THE POPE THAT WE'VE- IT

00:52:44.494 --> 00:52:45.495
ALSO TAKE A ACCOUNT. THAT THE

00:52:45.562 --> 00:52:47.497
DIFFERENT RESOURCES WE EXPECT TO

00:52:47.564 --> 00:52:49.833
RETIRE INCLUDING. ADDED DIABLO

00:52:49.900 --> 00:52:51.668
CANYON AT TWO THOUSAND MEGAWATTS

00:52:51.735 --> 00:52:53.470
ROUGHLY AS WELL AS SOME OF THEIR

00:52:53.537 --> 00:52:55.605
LEGACY- ONCE THROUGH COOLING

00:52:55.672 --> 00:52:58.074
AFTER THAT I KNOW ABOUT ABOUT

00:52:58.141 --> 00:52:59.175
FOUR THOUSAND MEGAWATTS. SO WE

00:52:59.242 --> 00:53:03.013
HAVE TAKEN THAT INTO ACCOUNT.

00:53:03.079 --> 00:53:03.647
WHAT ONE OF THE THINGS WE WERE

00:53:03.713 --> 00:53:05.515
NOT ABLE TO CATCH NOT PLAN IS. A

00:53:05.582 --> 00:53:07.350
COMPOSITE COINCIDENTAL EVENTS

00:53:07.417 --> 00:53:10.420
THAT ARE CONTINUING TO UNRAVEL.

00:53:10.487 --> 00:53:13.456
APPLE IN- AUGUST TWENTY TWENTY

00:53:13.523 --> 00:53:15.225
WE LOK AT HIGH HEAT-

00:53:15.292 --> 00:53:16.026
POSSIBILITY OF START PLANNING

00:53:16.092 --> 00:53:17.661
FOR HIGH HEAT. BUT WHAT WE

00:53:17.727 --> 00:53:19.829
OBSERVE IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE

00:53:19.896 --> 00:53:22.032
WHAT ARE THE LIABILITY SITUATION

00:53:22.098 --> 00:53:23.333
WAS NOT BECAUSE OF HIGH KEY IT

00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:25.669
WAS MORE BECAUSE THE FIRES AND

00:53:25.735 --> 00:53:27.571
FIRE RELATED OUTAGES PUT ON THE

00:53:27.637 --> 00:53:29.072
TRANSMISSION OF LAST GENERATION

00:53:29.139 --> 00:53:30.473
SITE. SO WE'RE TAKING THOSE

00:53:30.540 --> 00:53:31.708
THINGS INTO ACCOUNT AND TRYING

00:53:31.775 --> 00:53:34.010
TO PLAN THROUGH AND NOW AS WE

00:53:34.077 --> 00:53:36.012
LOOK AT THE COINCIDENTAL NATURE

00:53:36.079 --> 00:53:38.882
OF ALL BUSINESS. IF THEY WERE TO

00:53:38.949 --> 00:53:40.050
OCCUR IN EXTREME UP AN EXTREME

00:53:40.116 --> 00:53:42.285
SITUATION THAT MODOC RESPECT WE

00:53:42.352 --> 00:53:44.454
ARE LOOKING AT EXTREMELY

00:53:44.521 --> 00:53:46.656
OBNOXIOUS. YEAH MUCH OF THE

00:53:46.723 --> 00:53:48.425
BUDGET THAT THEY GIVE TODAY

00:53:48.491 --> 00:53:50.961
DISCUSSED- REALLY REALLY LOOKS

00:53:51.027 --> 00:53:52.596
TO THINK ABOUT THAT LOOKING A

00:53:52.662 --> 00:53:58.501
STRATEGIC RESERVE TO- OTHER SUCH

00:53:58.568 --> 00:54:00.503
AS SUCH AN EXTREME TO. IN TERMS

00:54:00.570 --> 00:54:03.073
LONG TERM PLAN. AS YOU KNOW- WE

00:54:03.139 --> 00:54:04.040
THE TIME PLAN THAT IT. THROUGH

00:54:04.107 --> 00:54:06.543
AND IT HIGHLIGHTS AND I WILL I

00:54:06.610 --> 00:54:09.379
TO THEM. IN A MOMENT- AND ALSO

00:54:09.446 --> 00:54:11.281
WANTED TO OFFER THE PLANNING WE

00:54:11.348 --> 00:54:13.483
ARE CONTINUING TO LOOK AT-

00:54:13.550 --> 00:54:15.518
SCENARIOS. HI OF PETITIONS IN

00:54:15.585 --> 00:54:18.154
OPERATING APPROACH. THAT I WOULD

00:54:18.221 --> 00:54:19.022
LIKE TO REQUEST MY PROPERTY-

00:54:19.089 --> 00:54:24.427
ARGUED MILLER. YES THIS IS MARK

00:54:24.494 --> 00:54:26.429
ROSS FISHER- CHIEF OPERATING

00:54:26.496 --> 00:54:28.598
OFFICER AT THE CALIFORNIA ISO.

00:54:28.665 --> 00:54:31.034
AND I WILL REPEAT- MUCH OF THE

00:54:31.101 --> 00:54:33.103
MATERIAL THAT- VICE CHAIR GUNDA

00:54:33.169 --> 00:54:35.205
HAD ALREADY EXPRESSED I'LL FOCUS

00:54:35.271 --> 00:54:37.207
MY COMMENTS ABOUT THE

00:54:37.273 --> 00:54:39.843
TRANSMISSION PLANNING. AND IN

00:54:39.909 --> 00:54:42.112
THAT REGARDS THE TRANSITION PLAN

00:54:42.178 --> 00:54:45.548
THAT WE DEVELOP IT IS- ALIGNS

00:54:45.615 --> 00:54:48.752
WITH ULTIMATELY THE PROCUREMENT.

00:54:48.818 --> 00:54:50.053
ACTIVITY IN THE RESOURCE

00:54:50.120 --> 00:54:51.621
PLANNING THAT IS CONDUCTED THE

00:54:51.688 --> 00:54:56.593
CPUC- SO WE TRY TO KEEP UP WITH.

00:54:56.660 --> 00:54:57.994
THE TRANSMISSION NECESSARY TO

00:54:58.061 --> 00:54:59.763
SUPPORT THOSE RECURSOS RESOURCE

00:54:59.829 --> 00:55:01.731
PLANS. I THINK WE'RE IN AN

00:55:01.798 --> 00:55:03.933
EXTRAORDINARY- DYNAMICSTHE RIGHT

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:05.135
NOW WHERE THE RESOURCE PLANS

00:55:05.201 --> 00:55:07.537
HAVE BEEN INCREASING YEAR OVER

00:55:07.604 --> 00:55:10.373
YEAR AND AS A RESULT OF THAT-

00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:12.676
THE TRANSMISSION PLANNING- TO

00:55:12.742 --> 00:55:14.511
SUPPORT THAT. HAS BECOME MORE

00:55:14.577 --> 00:55:16.246
CHALLENGING AN INCREASE IN THE

00:55:16.312 --> 00:55:18.715
FACT THIS LAST YEAR- WE

00:55:18.782 --> 00:55:21.818
APPROVED- ABOUT TWO POINT NINE.

00:55:21.885 --> 00:55:23.787
BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF.

00:55:23.853 --> 00:55:26.289
ADDITIONAL TRANSMISSION- TO

00:55:26.356 --> 00:55:27.657
SUPPORT THAT INCREASING GROWTH

00:55:27.724 --> 00:55:30.460
AND WE EXPECT THAT TO INCREASE.

00:55:30.527 --> 00:55:32.162
IN THE COMING YEARS OF THE-

00:55:32.228 --> 00:55:34.431
RESOURCE PLANS INCREASE. AS

00:55:34.497 --> 00:55:36.666
WELL. I THINK IT IS THE SECOND

00:55:36.733 --> 00:55:40.003
POINT IS- WE CONDITIONALLY- LOOK

00:55:40.070 --> 00:55:42.405
OUT- IN THE FIVE TO TEN YEAR.

00:55:42.472 --> 00:55:44.941
PLANNING HORIZON- THIS PAST YEAR

00:55:45.008 --> 00:55:48.645
WE ALSO. LOOK OUT OVER A TWENTY

00:55:48.712 --> 00:55:51.948
YEAR OUTLOOK. TO ALIGN WITH THE

00:55:52.015 --> 00:55:56.052
CDC'S SB ONE HUNDRED- AND-

00:55:56.119 --> 00:55:57.554
AND IN DOING SO WE TRY TO

00:55:57.620 --> 00:55:59.122
PROVIDE SOME INSIGHTS INTO WHAT

00:55:59.189 --> 00:56:01.825
IS THE TRANSMISSION NECESSARY IN

00:56:01.891 --> 00:56:04.327
THE LONGER TERM- TO SUPPORT

00:56:04.394 --> 00:56:06.996
CONTINUE TO SUPPORT FOR. THE

00:56:07.063 --> 00:56:09.999
CLEAN ENERGY TRANSITION- THESE

00:56:10.066 --> 00:56:11.768
WILL BECOME ACTIONABLE AS

00:56:11.835 --> 00:56:13.837
THEY'VE KIND OF ROLL INTO MORE

00:56:13.903 --> 00:56:15.638
THE TENURE RISE AND WILL

00:56:15.705 --> 00:56:17.607
CONTINUE TO WORK TO ADAPT THOSE

00:56:17.674 --> 00:56:20.009
AND IDENTIFY THOSE OF LARGER.

00:56:20.076 --> 00:56:24.247
MORE SIGNIFICANT. PROJECTS THAT

00:56:24.314 --> 00:56:25.215
ARE NECESSARY TO KEEP THE TRANS

00:56:25.281 --> 00:56:26.983
ASIAN- MOVE FORWARD- SO THAT I

00:56:27.050 --> 00:56:28.618
WILL STOP IF THERE'S ANY

00:56:28.685 --> 00:56:31.588
QUESTIONS. I JUST THANK YOU FOR

00:56:31.654 --> 00:56:33.823
THOSE COMMENTS I WANTED I WANTED

00:56:33.890 --> 00:56:35.925
ON RECORD BECAUSE I THINK THAT.

00:56:35.992 --> 00:56:37.327
THERE'S A LOT OF FOLKS WHO DON'T

00:56:37.393 --> 00:56:37.861
REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT'S

00:56:37.927 --> 00:56:39.262
HAPPENING IN CALIFORNIA.

00:56:39.329 --> 00:56:41.498
CALIFORNIA RATE WE TALKED ABOUT

00:56:41.564 --> 00:56:43.967
THE DIRECTOR TALKED A LITTLE BIT

00:56:44.033 --> 00:56:45.135
ABOUT. THE RATES. CALIFORNIANS

00:56:45.201 --> 00:56:50.140
PAY ALMOST A BILLION DOLLARS. IN

00:56:50.206 --> 00:56:52.842
RATES TO SHIFT POWER OUT OF OUR

00:56:52.909 --> 00:56:54.244
STATE BECAUSE WE OVER PRODUCED

00:56:54.310 --> 00:56:55.779
DURING CERTAIN TIMES WE HAVE A

00:56:55.845 --> 00:56:58.615
LOT OF WIND AND SUN- AND WE HAVE

00:56:58.681 --> 00:57:00.784
NO ABILITY TO TRANSPORT THE

00:57:00.850 --> 00:57:01.818
POWER TO PLACES IN CALIFORNIA

00:57:01.885 --> 00:57:03.453
WHERE WE NEED IT WE HAVE A HUGE

00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:04.387
TRANSMISSION PROBLEM IN

00:57:04.454 --> 00:57:06.656
CALIFORNIA AND- YEAH WE TALK

00:57:06.723 --> 00:57:08.825
ABOUT GETTING POWER WE WANT TO

00:57:08.892 --> 00:57:10.460
GO WE NEED TO DO IF THERE'S IF

00:57:10.527 --> 00:57:12.462
THERE'S ONE STATE OF EMERGENCY

00:57:12.529 --> 00:57:13.296
IT'S BUILT ENDING POWER LINES IN

00:57:13.363 --> 00:57:15.498
THIS IN THE STATE. TO GET THE

00:57:15.565 --> 00:57:16.699
POWER THAT WE OVER GENERATE TO

00:57:16.766 --> 00:57:18.735
THE PLACES THAT WERE UNDER

00:57:18.802 --> 00:57:19.502
GENERATED SO I WANNA GO ON

00:57:19.569 --> 00:57:22.438
RECORD AND WE TALK ABOUT I ONLY

00:57:22.505 --> 00:57:23.506
HEAR ABOUT HIS BATTERIES ARE

00:57:23.573 --> 00:57:25.241
GOING TO SAVE US. THEY'RE NOT.

00:57:25.308 --> 00:57:26.543
THEY'RE NOT SAVING US AT THE

00:57:26.609 --> 00:57:28.211
MOUNT OF POWER WE NEED TO

00:57:28.278 --> 00:57:30.046
ELECTRIFY OUR TRANSPORTATION.

00:57:30.113 --> 00:57:32.982
SECTOR AND ALSO POWER ARE. IN

00:57:33.049 --> 00:57:35.685
INDUSTRY IN OUR HOMES- WE CAN'T

00:57:35.752 --> 00:57:38.454
GET. PER PERMITTED FACILITY

00:57:38.521 --> 00:57:41.291
ANYWHERE IN THE STATE I MEAN.

00:57:41.357 --> 00:57:42.525
TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND MEGAWATTS

00:57:42.592 --> 00:57:43.426
COMING ONLINE I'D LIKE TO KNOW

00:57:43.493 --> 00:57:45.028
WHAT THE PROJECTION OF GETTING

00:57:45.094 --> 00:57:46.663
ONE OF THOSE PLANTS BUILT IN

00:57:46.729 --> 00:57:47.831
CALIFORNIA IN THE NEXT TEN

00:57:47.897 --> 00:57:49.766
YEARS. BECAUSE TEN YEARS AND

00:57:49.833 --> 00:57:51.734
DOLLARS WERE SUPPOSED TO MEET.

00:57:51.801 --> 00:57:54.804
OUR ELECTRIC VEHICLE MANDATE.

00:57:54.871 --> 00:57:56.406
AND SO I ACTUALLY USED TO BUILD

00:57:56.472 --> 00:57:58.875
POWER LINES AND BUILD POWER

00:57:58.942 --> 00:58:01.010
PLANTS WHEN I WAS YOUNGER. AND I

00:58:01.077 --> 00:58:02.979
ME TAKE SOME YOU DON'T JUST DO

00:58:03.046 --> 00:58:03.913
THAT OVERNIGHT. AND THE

00:58:03.980 --> 00:58:05.815
PERMITTING PROCESS IN CALIFORNIA

00:58:05.882 --> 00:58:08.618
SO ANTIQUATED THATFOR US TO GET

00:58:08.685 --> 00:58:10.820
WHERE WE WANT TO GO IS GONNA BE

00:58:10.887 --> 00:58:12.555
VERY DIFFICULT SO I WANT THIS

00:58:12.622 --> 00:58:13.156
COMMITTEE TO UNDERSTAND. AND

00:58:13.223 --> 00:58:15.258
THEN ON TOP OF THAT I WANT TO

00:58:15.325 --> 00:58:16.492
RECOGNIZE THAT AT LEAST- CANYON

00:58:16.559 --> 00:58:19.229
WHICH I DON'T ONE OF THE MEMBERS

00:58:19.295 --> 00:58:20.096
ON THIS COMMITTEE. REPRESENTS I

00:58:20.163 --> 00:58:21.598
BELIEVE- THEY'RE DROPPING THAT

00:58:21.664 --> 00:58:22.565
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE USING

00:58:22.632 --> 00:58:24.734
THAT THAT IS THE STORAGE FOR.

00:58:24.801 --> 00:58:25.835
NATURAL GAS THAT RUNS PEAKER

00:58:25.902 --> 00:58:28.872
PLANTS WHEN YOU HAVE. HI HE AND-

00:58:28.938 --> 00:58:31.507
AND NEED ELECTRICITY SO WE HAVE

00:58:31.574 --> 00:58:34.177
NO ABILITY TO. PRODUCE ENERGY

00:58:34.244 --> 00:58:35.578
CALIFORNIA'S GONNA BE IN THE

00:58:35.645 --> 00:58:37.714
DARK. AND WE'RE GONNA SEE A LOT

00:58:37.780 --> 00:58:39.349
OF PEOPLE REALLY FRUSTRATED IN

00:58:39.415 --> 00:58:42.619
CALIFORNIA'S I WANT. I WANT AND

00:58:42.685 --> 00:58:43.853
WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT THIS WE

00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:45.555
DON'T TALK ABOUT. THE LONG TERM

00:58:45.622 --> 00:58:47.357
EFFECTS OF THE SHORT TERM

00:58:47.423 --> 00:58:49.392
PROBLEMS BECAUSE WE DON'T DO

00:58:49.459 --> 00:58:51.928
GOOD PLANNING AND- LOOKED UP THE

00:58:51.995 --> 00:58:54.564

00:58:54.631 --> 00:58:56.299
WHEELING POWER WE CAN'T WILL

00:58:56.366 --> 00:58:57.500

01:03:56.399 --> 01:03:57.867
DROUGHT IN TWELVE CENTURIES. AND

01:03:57.934 --> 01:03:59.402
WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT THE

01:03:59.468 --> 01:04:02.205
PREDICTIONS FOR THE TWENTY

01:04:02.271 --> 01:04:03.806
TWENTY TWO YEAR AHEAD WE BURNED

01:04:03.873 --> 01:04:05.541
ALMOST ONE POINT FIVE MILLION

01:04:05.608 --> 01:04:07.543
ACRES ACROSS THE WEST- AND

01:04:07.610 --> 01:04:09.345
THAT'S FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND

01:04:09.412 --> 01:04:12.081
ACRES MORE. COMPARED TO THE TEN

01:04:12.148 --> 01:04:13.416
YEAR AVERAGE. SO PREDICTIONS FOR

01:04:13.482 --> 01:04:15.051
CALIFORNIA IT'S NOT LOOKING

01:04:15.117 --> 01:04:17.220
GOOD. IN WHILE I GREATLY

01:04:17.286 --> 01:04:19.088
APPRECIATE WHERE THE GOVERNOR

01:04:19.155 --> 01:04:20.890

HAVE GREAT RESPECT. FOR

01:04:28.164 --> 01:04:29.398
SECRETARY CRAWFORD I WAS JUST

01:04:29.465 --> 01:04:31.200
SHARING WITH SENATOR STERN THAT

01:04:31.267 --> 01:04:33.469
HE IS ONE OF THE HARDEST WORKING

01:04:33.536 --> 01:04:35.771
IN STATE SERVICE. AND THE FIRE

01:04:35.838 --> 01:04:38.674
CREWS IN THE SUPPORT STAFF THAT

01:04:38.741 --> 01:04:39.942
ARE BEING ADVANCED IN THIS

01:04:40.009 --> 01:04:43.946
BUDGET DOESN'T BEGIN TO FIX THE

01:04:44.013 --> 01:04:45.214
SHORTAGE THAT WE SEE IN

01:04:45.281 --> 01:04:47.216
CALIFORNIA. IT DOESN'T. AND I AM

01:04:47.283 --> 01:04:48.818
GRATEFUL THAT WE'RE ADVANCING

01:04:48.884 --> 01:04:50.453
CONSERVATION CORPS CREWS IN

01:04:50.519 --> 01:04:52.521
STAFFING UP THE NATIONAL GUARD

01:04:52.588 --> 01:04:54.657
BUT LET'S JUST BE CANDID WE HAVE

01:04:54.724 --> 01:04:57.293
A CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA RANKS IN

01:04:57.360 --> 01:04:59.095
THERE ARE PROUD BUNCH THEY DON'T

01:04:59.161 --> 01:05:00.463
WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE MENTAL

01:05:00.529 --> 01:05:02.365
HEALTH CONDITIONS THAT EXIST BUT

01:05:02.431 --> 01:05:04.200
THE FACT IS THAT WOMEN A MINUTE

01:05:04.267 --> 01:05:07.703
CAL FIVE WHO WERE DEPLOYED FORTY

01:05:07.770 --> 01:05:09.438
FIFTY SIXTY DAYS AT A TIME YEAR

01:05:09.505 --> 01:05:10.973
AFTER DAM YEAR AFTER DAM YEAR IT

01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:12.842
DOESN'T WORK ANY LONGER. AND THE

01:05:12.908 --> 01:05:14.877
ONLY WAY THAT WE'RE GONNA GET

01:05:14.944 --> 01:05:18.414
THROUGH THIS IS BY INVESTING. IN

01:05:18.481 --> 01:05:20.616
RELIEF IN THE WAY WE GET TO

01:05:20.683 --> 01:05:21.951
RELIEF IS BRINGING ON ADDITIONAL

01:05:22.018 --> 01:05:23.819
FIREFIGHTERS AND THAT IS NOT THE

01:05:23.886 --> 01:05:25.421
SILVER BULLET WE ALSO HAVE TO

01:05:25.488 --> 01:05:27.590
INVEST IN PREVENTION IS WELL-

01:05:27.657 --> 01:05:29.392
AND THAT'S WHY THE SENATE IS

01:05:29.458 --> 01:05:31.093
GOING TO INVEST. IN ENHANCED

01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:33.562
RESOURCES FOR PREVENTION BUT WE

01:05:33.629 --> 01:05:35.097
SHOULD BE DOUBLING THE NUMBER

01:05:35.164 --> 01:05:36.599
THE SIXTEEN HAND CREWS THAT WERE

SEVENTH YEAR IN A ROW WILL BE

01:05:51.447 --> 01:05:53.282
STANDING ON A STREET IN A

01:05:53.349 --> 01:05:54.750
COMMUNITY THAT I PROBABLY

01:05:54.817 --> 01:05:56.519

BECAUSE THE WEST IN THIS STATE

01:06:05.895 --> 01:06:07.863

01:06:15.538 --> 01:06:16.639
JUST BEING CANDID ABOUT IT I'M

01:06:16.706 --> 01:06:18.574

WE SIT HERE FRIEDGEN ACCEPTING

01:06:28.617 --> 01:06:32.188
THIS. RIDICULOUS ANSWER THAT WE

01:06:32.254 --> 01:06:33.356
SIMPLY HAVE ENOUGH STAFFING A

01:06:33.422 --> 01:06:35.825
CAL FIRE IT JUST BLOWS MY MIND

01:06:35.891 --> 01:06:37.893

01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:38.427
FRUSTRATED AND IT'S SUPER

01:06:38.494 --> 01:06:39.929
PERSONAL FOR SO MANY OF US

01:06:39.995 --> 01:06:41.897
BECAUSE WE ARE SEEN OUR

01:06:41.964 --> 01:06:42.498
COMMUNITIES. LITERALLY BURNED

01:06:42.565 --> 01:06:46.902

01:06:48.971 --> 01:06:50.573
STAFFING UP IN WE SIMPLY DON'T

01:06:50.639 --> 01:06:52.908
DO IT WE DON'T DO IT. SO I WE'RE

01:06:52.975 --> 01:06:54.810
GONNA NEED TO CONTINUE TO PUSH-

01:06:54.877 --> 01:06:57.513

DON'T WANT TO HEAR. THE ANSWERS

01:07:04.086 --> 01:07:05.354
BECAUSE IT'S THE SAME ANSWER

01:07:05.421 --> 01:07:06.822
THAT I HEARD LAST YEAR AND THE

01:07:06.889 --> 01:07:08.691
YEAR BEFORE THAT SO THAT'S WHY

01:07:08.758 --> 01:07:09.859
I'M JUST OFFERING COMMENTS AND

01:07:09.925 --> 01:07:12.361

01:13:45.087 --> 01:13:46.255
ONE FAMILY WHEN IT COMES TO

INVESTMENT IN CREWS- IS THAT. BY

01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:01.637
FAILING TO INVEST DEEPLY NOT

01:14:01.703 --> 01:14:04.039
ONLY IN IN THE CALIFORNIA RANKS

01:14:04.106 --> 01:14:05.541
BUT ALSO IN THE RANKS OF OUR

01:14:05.607 --> 01:14:07.409
CONTRACT COUNTIES. ESPECIALLY

01:14:07.476 --> 01:14:09.044
THOSE THAT ARE INVOLVED ARE

01:18:57.332 --> 01:18:58.733
THAT IN IN THE BUDGET CONTEXT

01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:01.870
IS- ABOUT THE RECYCLED WATER

01:19:01.937 --> 01:19:05.874
BUDGET AT I SEE HERE- HUNDRED

01:19:05.941 --> 01:19:08.410

PROPOSAL FOR WATER RECYCLING-

01:19:12.914 --> 01:19:14.883
AND- I KNOW THE SENATE HAS. I

01:19:14.950 --> 01:19:16.885
THINK- BILLION DOLLAR PROPOSAL

01:19:16.952 --> 01:19:18.887
ON THAT FRONT. AND I'M WONDERING

01:19:18.954 --> 01:19:20.388

TAKE PART OF THAT SENATOR- I

01:19:38.206 --> 01:19:39.441
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER

01:19:39.508 --> 01:19:40.876
THAT THE HUNDRED MILLION IS FOR

01:19:40.942 --> 01:19:43.245
GRANTS AND ANOTHER WAY THAT WE

01:19:43.311 --> 01:19:44.546
FINANCE A LOT OF THESE WATER

01:19:44.613 --> 01:19:45.814
RECYCLING PROJECTS IT'S THROUGH

01:19:45.881 --> 01:19:47.883
THE STATE REVOLVING FUND. THERE

01:19:47.949 --> 01:19:49.684
I THINK OVER JUST THIS LAST YEAR

01:19:49.751 --> 01:19:50.952
WE'LL HAVE COMMITTED ABOUT ONE

01:19:51.019 --> 01:19:52.854
POINT SIX BILLION TO WATER

RECYCLING PROJECTS THAT'LL

01:19:54.523 --> 01:19:56.124
CREATE ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE

01:19:56.191 --> 01:19:58.493
THOUSAND ACRE FEET A YEAR OF NEW

01:19:58.560 --> 01:20:00.395
SUPPLY SO THAT'S THE IF THE WHEN

01:20:00.462 --> 01:20:03.231
YOU LOOK AT THE FOUR HUNDRED

01:20:03.298 --> 01:20:04.032
MILLION THAT'S BEEN REQUESTED.

01:20:04.099 --> 01:20:04.733
FOR THE STATE MATCH FOR THE

01:20:04.799 --> 01:20:06.234
STATE REVOLVING FUND THOSE COULD

01:20:06.301 --> 01:20:07.802
BE CONSIDERED AS WELL- IMPORTANT

01:20:07.869 --> 01:20:09.437
DOLLARS FOR WATER RECYCLING WHEN

01:20:09.504 --> 01:20:11.606
IT COMES TO WHAT YOU KNOW THE

01:20:11.673 --> 01:20:13.074
POTENTIAL NEED IS OUT THERE.

01:20:13.141 --> 01:20:14.809
THERE'S A LOT AND WHEN IT COMES

01:20:14.876 --> 01:20:16.878
TO- GRANTS- YOU KNOW IF IT IS

01:20:16.945 --> 01:20:19.080
THEN YOU KNOW THE COMPONENT THAT

01:20:19.147 --> 01:20:19.981
HELPS WITH AFFORDABILITY BUT SO

01:20:20.048 --> 01:20:21.516
DO THE LOANS THAT STATE

01:20:21.583 --> 01:20:23.585
REVOLVING FUND. CAN PROVIDE

01:20:23.652 --> 01:20:25.887
WHICH ARE YOU KNOW HOW THE BOND

01:20:25.954 --> 01:20:27.322
RATE WHICH FOR ME AT THE

01:20:27.389 --> 01:20:28.890
SIGNIFICANT PROJECTS BUT THEY

01:20:28.957 --> 01:20:29.558
CAN COST HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF

01:20:29.624 --> 01:20:32.894
DOLLARS- IT CAN BE A SIGNIFICANT

01:20:32.961 --> 01:20:34.262
SAVINGS TO AFFORDABILITY AND

01:20:34.329 --> 01:20:35.630
COMMUNITY ITSELF. JUST WANT TO

01:20:35.697 --> 01:20:38.133
MAKE SURE AND FLAGGED- THAT OF

01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:45.273
THE PROJECT IS A PROPOSED.

01:20:45.340 --> 01:20:47.309
POSSIBLE BEHIND- THIS PRINT

01:20:47.375 --> 01:20:49.177
THESE PROJECTS BEING DEPLOYED

01:20:49.244 --> 01:20:50.845
AND WE KNOW THE- YOU KNOW THE

01:20:50.912 --> 01:20:53.481
UPGRADE POTENTIAL- JUST TAKE ONE

01:20:53.548 --> 01:20:56.685
WATER RECYCLING PLANT- CARSON OR

01:20:56.751 --> 01:20:59.254
HYPERION WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

01:20:59.321 --> 01:21:00.355
FIVE TO SIX BILLION DOLLAR

01:21:00.422 --> 01:21:02.157
PROJECTS AND THAT'S JUST FOR-

01:21:02.224 --> 01:21:04.159
THE SOUTH LAND ALONE SO I KNOW

01:21:04.226 --> 01:21:05.594
THE NEED IS HUGE I KNOW YOU'RE

01:21:05.660 --> 01:21:07.963
WELL AWARE OF IT- BUT I WOULD

01:21:08.029 --> 01:21:09.698
LOVE TO SORT OF GET A SENSE OF

01:21:09.764 --> 01:21:11.700
HOW FAR WE EXPECT BOTH WITH THE

01:21:11.766 --> 01:21:13.101
COMBINATION OF THE REVOLVING

01:21:13.168 --> 01:21:17.172
FUND. AND WITH THE GRANTS- A

01:21:17.239 --> 01:21:17.706
QUICK YOU KNOW SORT OF IN

01:21:17.772 --> 01:21:19.274
PROPORTION A NEEDS ASSESSMENT I

01:21:19.341 --> 01:21:20.809
THINK WOULD HELP TO SET SOME

01:21:20.875 --> 01:21:22.210
EXPECTATIONS BECAUSE THIS TO ME

01:21:22.277 --> 01:21:24.045
SEEMS LIKE A- REALLY SMART YEAR.

01:21:24.112 --> 01:21:27.282
TO BE GOING BIG ON THAT KIND OF

01:21:27.349 --> 01:21:28.316
WATER RESILIENCE INFRASTRUCTURE

01:21:28.383 --> 01:21:30.418
SO- LOOK FORWARD TO FOLLOWING UP

01:21:30.485 --> 01:21:32.821
THERE. WHAT WHILE I HAVE YOU A

01:21:32.887 --> 01:21:35.657
CHERISHED KABEL I WANTED TO A

01:21:35.724 --> 01:21:39.494
PIVOT TO ENERGY BRIEFLY- IT MAY

01:21:39.561 --> 01:21:41.429
SEEM ODD THAT I WOULD BE. ASKING

01:21:41.496 --> 01:21:43.164
YOU I ALSO. I THINK THE QUESTION

01:21:43.231 --> 01:21:45.433
ALSO GOES SOMEWHAT TO D. W. R.

01:21:45.500 --> 01:21:48.103
BUT- YOU KNOW WE HAD A

01:21:48.169 --> 01:21:50.138
DISCUSSION. I THINK IT WAS LAST

01:21:50.205 --> 01:21:51.339
YEAR AND EVEN THE YEAR BEFORE

01:21:51.406 --> 01:21:54.376
THAT- AROUND- THIS SORT OF ONE

01:21:54.442 --> 01:21:55.510
TIME EXTENSION OF ONCE THROUGH

01:21:55.577 --> 01:21:58.313
COOLING- GAS PLANTS AROUND THE

01:21:58.380 --> 01:22:00.982
STATE. AND AS WATER CHAIR MY

01:22:01.049 --> 01:22:03.285
CONCERNS WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL

01:22:03.351 --> 01:22:06.321
IMPACTS OF EXTENDING SOME OF

01:22:06.388 --> 01:22:09.524
THESE ALREADY OUTDATED-

01:22:09.591 --> 01:22:11.526
COMPONENTS OF OUR FLEET I'M

01:22:11.593 --> 01:22:13.128
TRYING TO GET A SENSE HERE AND

01:22:13.194 --> 01:22:14.529
I'M NOT SURE. WHICH PARTY

01:22:14.596 --> 01:22:15.597
MINISTRATIONS BEST TO ASK THIS

01:22:15.664 --> 01:22:17.599
BUT- IS THERE AN INTENTION WITH

01:22:17.666 --> 01:22:18.333
THE STRATEGIC ELECTRICITY

01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:21.036
RELIABILITY RESERVE- TWO WEEKS

01:22:21.102 --> 01:22:23.872
FURTHER EXTEND THE LIFE OF. OF

01:22:23.938 --> 01:22:26.207
THOSE KINDS OF GAS PLANTS AROUND

01:22:26.274 --> 01:22:28.977
THE STATE. THANK YOU SENATOR AND

01:22:29.044 --> 01:22:30.578
YOU KNOW HOW WE HAVE AN

01:22:30.645 --> 01:22:31.813
INSTRUMENT KNOWN AS IRAQ GROUP

01:22:31.880 --> 01:22:34.015
KNOWN AS A SACK WITH WHICH IS

01:22:34.082 --> 01:22:38.453
OUR- A GROUPING OF ALLIES SO ON

01:22:38.520 --> 01:22:39.888
THE ENERGY COMMISSION. IF YOU

01:22:39.954 --> 01:22:43.458
SEE AND THEY- HAVE GATHER AND

01:22:43.525 --> 01:22:47.028
CONSULT UP TO THE BOARD WHEN UP

01:22:47.095 --> 01:22:48.596
AND FLAG WHEN POTENTIAL CHANGES

01:22:48.663 --> 01:22:51.266
WILL WILL. AB I THINK AT THIS

01:22:51.333 --> 01:22:52.634
POINT WE'RE WAITING OR- SOME

01:22:52.701 --> 01:22:55.103
SIGNAL AND CONVENING FROM THE

01:22:55.170 --> 01:22:57.372
SOUTHWEST TO DOUBLE TO LET THE

01:22:57.439 --> 01:22:59.507
BOARD KNOW OUT WHAT. I REQUEST

01:22:59.574 --> 01:23:01.042
MAY BE COMING TO THEM TO HELP

01:23:01.109 --> 01:23:02.877
FACILITATE I KNOW WHAT R. I.

01:23:02.944 --> 01:23:06.648
ENERGY CHALLENGES. THAT- HAVE

01:23:06.715 --> 01:23:07.749
BEEN SPOKEN ABOUT. THANKS FOR

01:23:07.816 --> 01:23:09.451
THAT. AND MAYBE I COULD TURN TO

01:23:09.517 --> 01:23:12.954
I THINK. MAYBE W. R- OR THE OR

01:23:13.021 --> 01:23:15.623
THE ENERGY COMMISSION- YEAH IT

01:23:15.690 --> 01:23:18.993
LOOKS LIKE THE DVR FOUR POINT

01:23:19.060 --> 01:23:20.829
TWO BILLION AND- AND THEN THE

01:23:20.895 --> 01:23:21.396
ENERGY COMMISSION WHICH IS

01:23:21.463 --> 01:23:23.031
PLAYING A REALLY IMPORTANT NOT

01:23:23.098 --> 01:23:24.265
JUST DEPLOYMENT ROLE BUT ALSO

01:23:24.332 --> 01:23:26.000
PLANNING FUNCTION. IN ENSURING

01:23:26.067 --> 01:23:29.704
THAT NO THROUGH THIS RELIABILITY

01:23:29.771 --> 01:23:31.473
CHALLENGE THAT WERE ALSO-

01:23:31.539 --> 01:23:33.141
ACCELERATING OUR OUR CLIMATE

01:23:33.208 --> 01:23:35.577
GOALS I THINK WE CAN DO BOTH. I

01:23:35.643 --> 01:23:38.012
DON'T THINK IT'S A CHOICE

01:23:38.079 --> 01:23:40.248
BETWEEN- YOU KNOW INCREASE

01:23:40.315 --> 01:23:42.350
EMISSIONS ENDS FURTHER SETTING

01:23:42.417 --> 01:23:43.385
OURSELVES BACK IN OUR OUR

01:23:43.451 --> 01:23:45.086
SCOPING PLAN TARGETS. AND

01:23:45.153 --> 01:23:46.721
MEETING RELIABILITY AS WE SAW

01:23:46.788 --> 01:23:50.058
DURING THE EXTREME HEAT EVENTS-

01:23:50.125 --> 01:23:52.460
AND THE FIRES THAT RELIANCE ON

01:23:52.527 --> 01:23:55.230
CENTRALIZED BASELOAD GAS PLANTS

01:23:55.296 --> 01:23:56.965
AS TEXAS DID THROUGH THEIR

01:23:57.031 --> 01:23:58.867
EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS WAS

01:23:58.933 --> 01:24:01.002
ACTUALLY A- BAD STRATEGY- WE HAD

01:24:01.069 --> 01:24:02.971
OVER HEATING. WE HAD

01:24:03.037 --> 01:24:04.439
TRANSMISSION LINE CONSTRAINTS

01:24:04.506 --> 01:24:06.207
AND YET THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF

01:24:06.274 --> 01:24:07.642
MEGAWATTS THAT I UNDERSTAND ARE

01:24:07.709 --> 01:24:09.511
IN THE PIPELINE EITHER IN DEMAND

01:24:09.577 --> 01:24:12.414
RESPONSE. THROUGH THIRD PARTIES

01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:14.883
OR OR THE I. O. U.'S BUT

01:24:14.949 --> 01:24:15.517
ESPECIALLY THROUGH THIRD PARTIES

01:24:15.583 --> 01:24:19.554
AND AS WELL AS THE- THE SOLAR.

01:24:19.621 --> 01:24:21.189
AND OTHER SORT OF FLEXIBLE

01:24:21.256 --> 01:24:23.324
ASSETS THAT MAY BE BOTTLE

01:24:23.391 --> 01:24:26.194
NECKED- AND HAVE SOME RISK IN

01:24:26.261 --> 01:24:30.532
THE PIPELINE GIVEN THE- THE. THE

01:24:30.598 --> 01:24:33.535
LARGER. THE FINANCIAL FACING-

01:24:33.601 --> 01:24:35.403
THE SOLAR STORAGE COMMUNITY FROM

01:24:35.470 --> 01:24:36.538
FROM SOME OF THE FEDERAL

01:24:36.604 --> 01:24:39.207
INQUIRIES UNDER WAY- FTC IN

01:24:39.274 --> 01:24:40.508
OTHER INVESTIGATIONS OF SORT OF

01:24:40.575 --> 01:24:43.411
CAST TO. A BIT OF ANXIETY OVER

01:24:43.478 --> 01:24:45.246
THE INVESTMENT CLIMATE AND I

01:24:45.313 --> 01:24:48.650
WONDER IF WE CAN DO ANYTHING- TO

01:24:48.716 --> 01:24:49.951
ACCELERATE DEPLOYMENT THERE IN A

01:24:50.018 --> 01:24:51.419
WAY THAT DOESN'T COST THE

01:24:51.486 --> 01:24:53.521
TAXPAYERS MUCH BUT SIMPLY DE

01:24:53.588 --> 01:24:55.790
RISKS THE- THE PROJECT

01:24:55.857 --> 01:24:58.493
DEPLOYMENT SO IF WE'RE THINKING

01:24:58.560 --> 01:25:00.161
ABOUT. NO SEE THERE'S TWO

01:25:00.228 --> 01:25:02.263
THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF- COMMUNITY

01:25:02.330 --> 01:25:08.069
SCALE- STORAGE AND SOLAR- IS

01:25:08.136 --> 01:25:10.004
THERE FLEXIBILITY WITHIN THE

01:25:10.071 --> 01:25:11.039
STRATEGIC ELECTRICITY

01:25:11.105 --> 01:25:14.943
RELIABILITY RESERVE TO- TO SORT

01:25:15.009 --> 01:25:17.912
OF. D. RISK THAT DEPLOYMENT AND

01:25:17.979 --> 01:25:19.147
I'M TALKING A MATTER OF MONTHS

01:25:19.214 --> 01:25:20.915
TO GET THOSE KINDS OF PROJECTS

01:25:20.982 --> 01:25:22.984
ONLINE BECAUSE BUILDING A HIGH

01:25:23.051 --> 01:25:24.018
VOLTAGE TRANSMISSION LINE WILL

01:25:24.085 --> 01:25:25.987
TAKE YEARS IS CENTER DOLLY

01:25:26.054 --> 01:25:28.256
RIGHTLY NOTED BUT THESE PROJECTS

01:25:28.323 --> 01:25:29.958
WILL TAKE MONTHS AND THEY'RE IN

01:25:30.024 --> 01:25:32.193
LINE IT JUST SOUNDS LIKE- WE

01:25:32.260 --> 01:25:34.729
NEED TO JUST FIND A WAY TO. MAKE

01:25:34.796 --> 01:25:36.231
THEM GO SO I JUST WANTED TO GET

01:25:36.297 --> 01:25:37.665
A SENSE FROM WHOEVER THE

01:25:37.732 --> 01:25:38.299
ADMINISTRATION SORT OF TAKING

01:25:38.366 --> 01:25:41.402
THE LEAD ON. THAT RESERVE WHAT

01:25:41.469 --> 01:25:42.403
THE WHAT THE OVERALL INTENTIONS

01:25:42.470 --> 01:25:45.640
ARE- EXTENDING GAS MORE ABOUT

01:25:45.707 --> 01:25:48.776
TRANSMISSION OR- OR SORT OF

01:25:48.843 --> 01:25:51.679
DOUBLING DOWN ON ON CLEAN ENERGY

01:25:51.746 --> 01:25:53.481
TO MEET THOSE NEEDS. YEAH I

01:25:53.548 --> 01:25:54.549
THINK SENATOR STERN IN A MOMENT

01:25:54.616 --> 01:25:56.417
I'LL TURN TO COMMISSIONER- AND-

01:25:56.484 --> 01:25:57.752
FROM THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY

01:25:57.819 --> 01:25:59.654
COMMISSION AND YOU RIGHTLY KNOW

01:25:59.721 --> 01:26:00.555
IT IS A PARTNERSHIP OF OUR

01:26:00.622 --> 01:26:02.357
INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR RCP

01:26:02.423 --> 01:26:03.992
U. C. I CALIFORNIA ENERGY

01:26:04.058 --> 01:26:04.959
COMMISSION AND OF COURSE

01:26:05.026 --> 01:26:06.327
DEPARTMENT WATER RESOURCES

01:26:06.394 --> 01:26:08.196
GIVEN. IT TAKES A SIGNIFICANT

01:26:08.263 --> 01:26:09.597
AMOUNT OF ENERGY TO MOVE WATER

01:26:09.664 --> 01:26:11.332
AROUND THE STATE. I WILL KNOW

01:26:11.399 --> 01:26:13.201
THAT YOU KNOW PREVIOUS ACTIONS

01:26:13.268 --> 01:26:14.736
TO ADDRESS THIS CRITICAL

01:26:14.802 --> 01:26:16.704
PRIORITY OF MAINTAINING

01:26:16.771 --> 01:26:19.707
RELIABILITY. YOU INCLUDED UNDER

01:26:19.774 --> 01:26:21.476
. PROCUREMENT OF BATTERY STORAGE

01:26:21.543 --> 01:26:23.011
WHICH I THINK WE ALL RECOGNIZE

01:26:23.077 --> 01:26:26.948
IS A LARGE PART OF THE FUTURE-

01:26:27.015 --> 01:26:28.583
EMERGENCY GENERATION. AND

01:26:28.650 --> 01:26:30.718
ACCELERATING. BUT COMMISSIONER

01:26:30.785 --> 01:26:32.887
GUNTER CAN YOU JUST BECAUSE THIS

IS THE FIRST TIME WE'RE TALKING

01:26:33.588 --> 01:26:34.822
ABOUT THE RELIABILITY RESERVE I

01:26:34.889 --> 01:26:36.224
THINK WITH THE SUBCOMMITTEE CAN

01:26:36.291 --> 01:26:38.660

I JUST WANNA. FIVE STARTED THE

01:26:57.478 --> 01:26:59.480
TOP AND IT JUST KIND OF TALKING

01:26:59.547 --> 01:27:01.049
ABOUT THE- ENERGY TO LIABILITY.

01:27:01.115 --> 01:27:03.484
AND THAT KIND OF AGAINST CLIMATE

01:27:03.551 --> 01:27:05.119
CHANGE AND SECURING ENERGY

01:27:05.186 --> 01:27:07.488
RELIABILITY. DURING THE-

01:27:07.555 --> 01:27:10.325
TRANSITION. SO HAVE NO FRANKLY

01:27:10.391 --> 01:27:12.927
SPEAKING IN OVER THE LAST COUPLE

01:27:12.994 --> 01:27:14.896
OF YEARS. THE CHALLENGES THAT

01:27:14.963 --> 01:27:17.999
EXPEDIENCY ING- ARE. REALLY

01:27:18.066 --> 01:27:21.536
EXTREMELY LARGE AND- YOU BELIEVE

01:27:21.603 --> 01:27:25.640
IT. THANK YOU KNOW THE YOU KNOW

THINK READING DEMAND BEYOND THE

01:27:29.577 --> 01:27:31.045
MUCH BEYOND THE PLAN ASSUMPTION

01:27:31.112 --> 01:27:32.814
. IT COULD BE EXTENDED DROUGHT.

01:27:32.880 --> 01:27:35.350
YOU KNOW CURRENTLY- ARE LOOKING

01:27:35.416 --> 01:27:37.352
GUY. A RECORD LEVEL TO DEBATE IN

01:27:37.418 --> 01:27:39.187
IN HYDRO CONDITIONS AND IT COULD

01:27:39.253 --> 01:27:41.122
BE SOMETHING LIKE A BOOK LIKE

01:27:41.189 --> 01:27:43.224
WILDFIRE. THAT COULD KNOCK OUT

01:27:43.291 --> 01:27:44.525
ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND MEGAWATT

01:27:44.592 --> 01:27:45.526
TRANSMISSION COMING INTO

01:27:45.593 --> 01:27:48.029
CALIFORNIA. THE SERVER LOAD SO

01:27:48.096 --> 01:27:50.231
WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS- POTENTIAL

01:27:50.298 --> 01:27:54.602
OF ALL THE THINGS CONVERGING. AS

01:27:54.669 --> 01:27:55.370
WE MOVE PARTNER THE EXPLODING

01:27:55.436 --> 01:27:57.472
THAT TOO AND I'M PRESS. LEVEL OF

01:27:57.538 --> 01:27:59.774
RELIABILITY CHALLENGE. SO AS WE

01:27:59.841 --> 01:28:01.776
THINK THROUGH THEN ADDED A

01:28:01.843 --> 01:28:03.444
MEDIATION OF THAT- YOU KNOW

01:28:03.511 --> 01:28:06.147
LOOKING AT THE GOT PROPOSAL-

01:28:06.214 --> 01:28:08.082
PROPOSAL IS ABOUT. I DON'T HAVE

01:28:08.149 --> 01:28:09.050
BILLION. FOR THE OVERALL

01:28:09.117 --> 01:28:11.352
STRATEGIC RESERVE COMPONENTS.

01:28:11.419 --> 01:28:13.254
AND THE RESERVE HAS TO BE KIND

01:28:13.321 --> 01:28:15.156
OF THING THROUGH. AT THIS POINT

01:28:15.223 --> 01:28:16.724
IN THAT THE AGENT COULD COME. TO

01:28:16.791 --> 01:28:18.726
THROUGH. WE HAVE A NEED FOR.

01:28:18.793 --> 01:28:21.396
ENSURING A LARGE AMOUNT OF

01:28:21.462 --> 01:28:22.664
MEGAWATTS CAN QUICKLY COME

01:28:22.730 --> 01:28:24.532
ONLINE SAID THAT THE- IF THE A

01:28:24.599 --> 01:28:26.334
FUNCTION OF THESE RESOURCES THAT

01:28:26.401 --> 01:28:28.870
WE COULD BRING IT TO THE STATE.

01:28:28.936 --> 01:28:30.438
OUR IT'S ALSO THE- IN WHICH WE

01:28:30.505 --> 01:28:32.840
DEPLOY THEM. I'M RESOURCE GUIDE

01:28:32.907 --> 01:28:35.276
WITH THE- SO THAT WE NOT.

01:28:35.343 --> 01:28:36.678
INHIBITED BY SUPPLIES ISSUES ON

01:28:36.744 --> 01:28:38.713
A- TYPE. AND ALIGNMENT WITH

01:28:38.780 --> 01:28:41.249
STATE AND PRIOR. AS WE THINK.

01:28:41.315 --> 01:28:43.685
AND ALSO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

01:28:43.751 --> 01:28:45.586
LEVERAGE FEDERAL FUNDING. SO

01:28:45.653 --> 01:28:55.930
WHEN WE LOOK AT THAT- TALAGA.

01:28:55.997 --> 01:28:59.534
THE TO TWO H. IN A WE HAD A AT.

01:28:59.600 --> 01:29:00.334
QUICKLY RAMPING UP ITS FIFTY

01:29:00.401 --> 01:29:02.804
RESERVE. AND THAT MIGHT NOT-

01:29:02.870 --> 01:29:05.640
THREE. SOME THE ASSETS THAT ARE-

01:29:05.707 --> 01:29:06.574
LOOKING TO RETIRE. BUT

01:29:06.641 --> 01:29:10.545
MODERNISED THE THERE IN. THANK

01:29:10.611 --> 01:29:12.313
SO THAT REMOVED HIM OF THE MY

01:29:12.380 --> 01:29:13.548
PLACE. YOU'RE NOT TREATED IF THE

01:29:13.614 --> 01:29:15.183
-REGULARLY WHEN WE LOOK AT THE

01:29:15.249 --> 01:29:16.651
NEED FOR THE STRATEGIC. BUT

01:29:16.718 --> 01:29:18.352
LOOKING AT SIXTY HOURS A YEAR

01:29:18.419 --> 01:29:20.722
ROUGHLY SIXTY HOURS A YEAR. AND

01:29:20.788 --> 01:29:21.823
THAT'S REALLY WHEN YOU HAVE THE

01:29:21.889 --> 01:29:24.459
WALLET. OF BOTH INCREASED. AND

01:29:24.525 --> 01:29:25.426
THE INTERSECTION OF POTENTIALLY

01:29:25.493 --> 01:29:28.529
. A LOT MEGALITHIC SUPPLY. SO

01:29:28.596 --> 01:29:31.032
MANY TIED TO OF AB THAT WHOLE.

01:29:31.099 --> 01:29:33.134
AND FIX THAT OF OUR OF RESOURCE

01:29:33.201 --> 01:29:34.335
. WE HAVE TO AT WHAT IS.

01:29:34.402 --> 01:29:35.937
CURRENTLY A BILL. AND IT'S GOOD

01:29:36.003 --> 01:29:38.406
DEAL TODAY. BUT BUILT IN THE CON

01:29:38.473 --> 01:29:40.541
OF THE LAW. PRIORITIES CAN

01:29:40.608 --> 01:29:41.809
BROUGHT THIS. RESERVE AT THE

01:29:41.876 --> 01:29:46.547
WEIGHT US TO HOLD A TO THINGS.

01:29:46.614 --> 01:29:49.917
ALL THERE INCLUDING AT THE END

01:29:49.984 --> 01:29:51.419
BACKUP GENERATOR THAT ARE. WE

01:29:51.486 --> 01:29:53.554
COULD HAVE PUT IN SOME- AND THAT

01:29:53.621 --> 01:29:54.756
THE BUDGET HAS MONEY FOR

01:29:54.822 --> 01:29:57.024
CLEANING COMING DIESEL ADDS THAT

01:29:57.091 --> 01:29:58.693
. AND ALSO HAD MY FOR DEMAND BY

01:29:58.760 --> 01:30:00.061
INCENTIVES. AND INCREASING

01:30:00.128 --> 01:30:01.496
AMOUNT OF CLICK. THAT WE COULD.

01:30:01.562 --> 01:30:03.698
EXPLORE SO OVERALL THE STRATEGY

01:30:03.765 --> 01:30:06.968
WOULD BE GIVEN THAT THE LARGE

01:30:07.034 --> 01:30:08.202
GAP THAT WE'RE OBSERVING. COULD

01:30:08.269 --> 01:30:09.937
BE QUICKLY THEN CLAMPED UP WITH

01:30:10.004 --> 01:30:12.173
WHAT RESOURCES WE QUICKLY BRING

01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:14.408
ON. IN A COST EFFECTIVE MANNER

01:30:14.475 --> 01:30:16.577
BUT AS WE GO INTO THE NEXT FIVE

01:30:16.644 --> 01:30:18.980
YEARS OF CONTINUE TO. EXPAND THE

01:30:19.046 --> 01:30:20.748
STRATEGIC RESERVE AND I THINK IT

01:30:20.815 --> 01:30:23.251
TO THE ADEQUATE D. AS OTHER

01:30:23.317 --> 01:30:25.520
POLICY PRIORITIES SHAPE UP WE

01:30:25.586 --> 01:30:27.288
CAN THINK THROUGH- YOU KNOW

01:30:27.355 --> 01:30:29.357
EXPANDING THAT INTO CLEAN. FIVE

01:30:29.423 --> 01:30:31.325
TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THAT WE DO

01:30:31.392 --> 01:30:33.227
NOT WANT TO INTERFERE. WITH THE

01:30:33.294 --> 01:30:35.363
PROCUREMENT OF THE UTILITIES SO

01:30:35.429 --> 01:30:36.631
WE WANT TO UTILITIES TO

01:30:36.697 --> 01:30:38.633
CONTINUE. MOVING FORWARD

01:30:38.699 --> 01:30:40.301
ADEQUATELY TO WORK THE SB ONE

01:30:40.368 --> 01:30:42.603
HUNDRED GOALS IN THE IN THE- IN

01:30:42.670 --> 01:30:43.538
PROCURING THE CLEAN ENERGY

01:30:43.604 --> 01:30:45.439
SOURCES. AND WE GIVE THEM THE

01:30:45.506 --> 01:30:48.342
FREEDOM TO DO SO BY ALLOWING THE

01:30:48.409 --> 01:30:49.544
FIFTY TWO COULD THERE BUT THE

01:30:49.610 --> 01:30:52.079
INSURANCE. THAT'S COMPRISED OF A

01:30:52.146 --> 01:30:53.981
BROAD. PORTFOLIO OF WITH CLEAN

01:30:54.048 --> 01:30:56.617
AND TRADITIONAL WITH THE I. TWO

01:30:56.684 --> 01:30:57.852
WORDS HOW QUICKLY CAN WE BUILD

01:30:57.919 --> 01:30:59.320
AT A COST EFFECTIVELY BE CAN BE

01:30:59.387 --> 01:31:01.055
BUILT AND PROVIDE FOR. OUR NEEDS

01:31:01.122 --> 01:31:09.463
THAT. THANK YOU FOR THAT MISS OF

01:31:09.530 --> 01:31:11.666
A CHAIRED. SAID JUST TO. TRY

INTERPRET YOUR- IT'S A LIKE.

01:31:12.967 --> 01:31:13.534
THERE SOME NEAR TERM INTO. TO

01:31:13.601 --> 01:31:17.138
LEAN ON. A VARIETY OF ASSETS BUT

01:31:17.205 --> 01:31:20.107
BUT CERTAINLY- EXPANDING THE USE

01:31:20.174 --> 01:31:22.443
OF GAS AND GOING BEYOND SAY THE

01:31:22.510 --> 01:31:23.711
ONCE THROUGH COOLING RETIREMENT

01:31:23.778 --> 01:31:25.746
TIMELINES DOES NOT SOUND LIKE

01:31:25.813 --> 01:31:27.215
IT'S OFF THE TABLE IN FACT

01:31:27.281 --> 01:31:29.050
SOUNDS LIKE IT'S VERY MUCH ON

01:31:29.116 --> 01:31:30.618
THE TABLE AND- AND PART OF THE

01:31:30.685 --> 01:31:32.386
PLAN IN THE NEAR TERM IS THAT IS

01:31:32.453 --> 01:31:34.889
THAT FAIR TO SAY. FOR THIS

01:31:34.956 --> 01:31:38.226
COMING YEAR. AT YES SENATOR.

JUST ASK THAT I KNOW THAT A

01:31:46.434 --> 01:31:47.535
PIECE OF THIS PUZZLE IS ALSO THE

01:31:47.602 --> 01:31:49.604
AT WITH THE ENERGY COMMISSION.

01:31:49.670 --> 01:31:50.404
IF THERE'S IF THERE'S ANY WAY

01:31:50.471 --> 01:31:52.540
TO. TO LOOK AT SORT OF A

01:31:52.607 --> 01:31:54.842
PRIORITIZATION FRAMEWORK AS YOU

01:31:54.909 --> 01:31:56.777
LOOK THROUGH IT FOR THOSE KINDS

01:31:56.844 --> 01:31:59.146
OF ENERGY RESERVES. THAT ARE

01:31:59.213 --> 01:32:01.716
GOING TO MEET OUR CLIMATE GOALS

01:32:01.782 --> 01:32:05.052
AS WELL. TO PUT THOSE- YOU KNOW

01:32:05.119 --> 01:32:07.355
SORT OF. WITH WITH A RISK ADDER

01:32:07.421 --> 01:32:09.457
ON TOP RIGHT WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING

01:32:09.523 --> 01:32:11.626
AT. WHAT WHAT ACTUALLY ISN'T

01:32:11.692 --> 01:32:14.195
RELIABLE ENOUGH- TO MEET THESE

01:32:14.262 --> 01:32:16.497
DEMANDS. I WOULD JUST ASK THAT-

01:32:16.564 --> 01:32:19.967
YOU YOU ALL CONSIDER- SOME KIND

01:32:20.034 --> 01:32:23.104
OF CLIMATE FILTER. THAT PLAN-

01:32:23.170 --> 01:32:25.072
THAT ALSO LOOKS AT SPEED-

01:32:25.139 --> 01:32:27.408
BECAUSE I THINK THAT. AS I SAID

01:32:27.475 --> 01:32:29.877
I THINK THERE'S ABOUT TWENTY

01:32:29.944 --> 01:32:30.511
FIVE HUNDRED MEGAWATTS. IN THE

01:32:30.578 --> 01:32:33.714
PIPELINE OF. OF ASSETS THAT

01:32:33.781 --> 01:32:35.082
DON'T REQUIRE ANY SUBSIDY THAT

01:32:35.149 --> 01:32:37.618
ARE ALREADY BEING PLANNED AND

01:32:37.685 --> 01:32:39.420
FOR DEPLOYMENT AROUND THE STATE.

01:32:39.487 --> 01:32:42.523
WITH CLEAN STORAGE WITH SOLAR-

01:32:42.590 --> 01:32:44.759
THAT SHOULD BE FLEXIBLE ENOUGH

01:32:44.825 --> 01:32:46.661
FOR IT TO BE USEFUL TO THE AYE

01:32:46.727 --> 01:32:48.429
SO AS WELL AS TO D. W. ARE SO.

01:32:48.496 --> 01:32:51.198
HOPE YOU OAK CONSIDER THAT AND

HAVE SOME KIND OF PRIORITIZATION

01:32:51.933 --> 01:32:52.533
FRAMEWORK SO THAT. WE DON'T SORT

01:32:52.600 --> 01:32:54.468
OF SET OURSELVES BACKWARDS HERE

01:32:54.535 --> 01:32:56.470
BUT I DO RECOGNIZE THE UNIQUE

01:32:56.537 --> 01:32:57.471

IS OUR BEST REAL RELIABILITY

01:33:10.885 --> 01:33:14.555
STRATEGY SO- I APPRECIATE THAT.

01:33:14.622 --> 01:33:16.624
THE ONLY OTHER THING I WANT TO

01:33:16.691 --> 01:33:18.526
ECHO WAS JUST- ON WHEN IT COMES

01:33:18.592 --> 01:33:21.395
TO. ABOUT FIRE PREVENTION AND

01:33:21.462 --> 01:33:23.464

DISPATCHABLE WHEN WE NEED THEM

01:35:53.347 --> 01:35:54.849
SO THAT WOULD NOT GENERALLY

01:35:54.915 --> 01:35:58.853
INCLUDE LARGE- BASED BASED POWER

01:35:58.919 --> 01:36:00.955

SUBSTANCE AND WE THINK IN THE

01:43:54.428 --> 01:43:55.696
FUTURE AS WE MOVE TOWARDS CARBON

01:43:55.762 --> 01:43:57.197
NEUTRALITY WHICH OF COURSE IS

01:43:57.264 --> 01:43:58.498
OUR KEY GOAL. IT'S GOING TO BE

01:43:58.565 --> 01:44:01.001
REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT. THAT

01:44:01.068 --> 01:44:03.136
STRATEGIC RELIABILITY RESERVE IS

01:44:03.203 --> 01:44:05.138
ALL ABOUT ENSURING THAT WE

01:44:05.205 --> 01:44:07.507

THE LEXUS VERSION NOW AND THAT'S

01:45:10.637 --> 01:45:13.140
VERY EXPENSIVE BUT THERE'S ALSO

01:45:13.206 --> 01:45:14.841
NATURE BASE DRUM- A CARBON

01:45:14.908 --> 01:45:16.677
CAPTURE THERE'S ALSO THE GOOD

THE AIR QUALITY AND SO IF WE IF

01:45:45.839 --> 01:45:46.807
WE PUT OF A HUNDRED MILLION INTO

01:45:46.873 --> 01:45:47.708
DEVELOPMENT OF A DIRECTOR

YET- AVAILABLE FOR THIS STUDY

01:47:14.361 --> 01:47:15.495
WERE SURE OF GOING OFF A

01:47:15.562 --> 01:47:17.664
COMBINATION OF THE DESCRIPTION

01:47:17.731 --> 01:47:20.634
IN THE- BUDGET SAY IN THE

01:47:20.700 --> 01:47:22.502
MEMBERS SUMMARY DOCUMENTS AND

ALSO SOME SOME BRIEFINGS THAT

01:47:24.070 --> 01:47:25.005
WE'VE HAD WITH THE

01:47:25.071 --> 01:47:27.941
ADMINISTRATION- ARE UNDERSTOOD

01:47:28.008 --> 01:47:29.309
THIS IS A PROPOSAL THAT HAS A

01:47:29.376 --> 01:47:33.914
VARIETY OF- COMPONENTS- ARE I

01:47:33.980 --> 01:47:35.382
DIDN'T DEPART YOU'RE DESCRIBING

01:47:35.448 --> 01:47:38.185
IS ONE OF THE WHAT WE DO IS SORT

01:47:38.251 --> 01:47:39.319
OF THE CENTRAL COMPONENTS THAT

01:47:39.386 --> 01:47:41.488
WE HAVE- I STARTED TO TAKE A

01:47:41.555 --> 01:47:46.193
LOOK AT. WHICH IS- SENSUALLY AS

01:47:46.259 --> 01:47:48.128
WE UNDERSTAND IT TO PROHIBIT

01:47:48.195 --> 01:47:50.263
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FROM IMPOSING

01:47:50.330 --> 01:47:53.934
TAXES ON LITHIUM. EXTRACTION AND

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:57.671
INSTEAD TO IMPOSE A STATE TAX ON

01:47:57.737 --> 01:48:03.143
LITHIUM EXTRACTION- AND THE- DAY

01:48:03.210 --> 01:48:05.278
THE RATE FOR PROPOSED RATE HAS

01:48:05.345 --> 01:48:11.151
NOT YET BEEN- SPECIFIED- AND SO.

01:48:11.218 --> 01:48:12.919
YOU KNOW IN DISCUSSIONS WITH THE

01:48:12.986 --> 01:48:15.222
ADMINISTRATION OUR UNDERSTANDING

01:48:15.288 --> 01:48:16.690
IS SORT OF THAT THE MAIN

01:48:16.756 --> 01:48:20.260
ARGUMENT FOR DOING THIS IS THAT-

01:48:20.327 --> 01:48:21.761
IT WOULD HELP THE INDUSTRY

01:48:21.828 --> 01:48:23.663
EXPAND IN PART BY PROVIDING

01:48:23.730 --> 01:48:27.334
CERTAINTY ABOUT THE TAX POLICIES

01:48:27.400 --> 01:48:30.237
THAT WOULD APPLY TO. LITHIUM

01:48:30.303 --> 01:48:33.006
EXTRACTION- AND THERE'S SORT OF

01:48:33.073 --> 01:48:34.374
A FURTHER ARGUMENT THAT THE

01:48:34.441 --> 01:48:35.342
STATE SHOULD ACT NOW DUE TO

01:48:35.408 --> 01:48:37.010
POTENTIAL LOCAL ACTIONS LATER

01:48:37.077 --> 01:48:39.246
THIS YEAR PERHAPS IMPOSING LOCAL

01:48:39.312 --> 01:48:41.548
TAXES. I AND CERTAINLY IN SOME

01:48:41.615 --> 01:48:43.083
SITUATIONS ON CERTAIN LOCAL

01:48:43.149 --> 01:48:44.718
POLICIES CAN DISCOURAGE PRIVATE

01:48:44.784 --> 01:48:47.387
INVESTMENT WHICH COULD JUSTIFY

01:48:47.454 --> 01:48:48.722
PREEMPTION BY THE STATE BUT IN

01:48:48.788 --> 01:48:53.460
THIS CASE. ARE YOU MINISTRATION

01:48:53.526 --> 01:48:55.128
HAS NOT PRESENTED SO FAR ANY

01:48:55.195 --> 01:48:56.630
EVIDENCE IN THE THAT POLICY

01:48:56.696 --> 01:48:57.163
UNCERTAINTY IS WEAKENING

01:48:57.230 --> 01:48:58.732
INVESTMENT IN THIS INDUSTRY.

01:48:58.798 --> 01:49:00.433
IT'S NOT CLEAR WHY THE STATE

01:49:00.500 --> 01:49:01.835
WOULD BE BETTER POSITIONS TO

01:49:01.902 --> 01:49:04.304
COMMIT TO FUTURE POLICIES THUS

01:49:04.371 --> 01:49:06.606
PROVIDING CERTAINTY- MORE SO THE

01:49:06.673 --> 01:49:10.443
LOCAL GUY- IT IF AS THE

01:49:10.510 --> 01:49:12.345
ADMINISTRATION SEEMS TO

01:49:12.412 --> 01:49:14.848
ANTICIPATE- A LOCAL ACTIONS ARE

01:49:14.915 --> 01:49:16.616
CURRENTLY NEAR FUTURE. AT EVERY

01:49:16.683 --> 01:49:19.619
EARLY SO AT THE INDUSTRIES

01:49:19.686 --> 01:49:20.887
DEVELOP THAT'S IN LIKE IT SHOULD

01:49:20.954 --> 01:49:24.624
CREE MORE. NOT LESS AND FINALLY

01:49:24.691 --> 01:49:27.661
- THIS TO CAN PREAMP LOCAL TECH

01:49:27.727 --> 01:49:29.329
. ONE OF THE SORT OF UNDERLYING

01:49:29.396 --> 01:49:30.864
THERE IS THAT THE STATE WOULD

01:49:30.931 --> 01:49:32.766
FIRST HAVE A SENSE OF WHAT YOU

01:49:32.832 --> 01:49:33.433
PROCREATE TAX RATE WOULD BE MORE

01:49:33.500 --> 01:49:36.102
SO THAN LOCALS. BUT BECAUSE THE

01:49:36.169 --> 01:49:37.537
ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL

01:49:37.604 --> 01:49:40.373
DOESN'T INCLUDE TAX RATE- THAT

01:49:40.440 --> 01:49:41.908
SEEMS SORT OF LIKE A

01:49:41.975 --> 01:49:42.575
QUESTIONABLE PREMISE AT THIS

01:49:42.642 --> 01:49:44.210
IME AND THEN A REVISION

01:49:44.277 --> 01:49:45.445
TIMELINE DOESN'T PUT THE

01:49:45.512 --> 01:49:46.646
LEGISLATURE IN A POSITION TO

01:49:46.713 --> 01:49:48.248
COME UP WITH ITS OWN TAX RATES

01:49:48.315 --> 01:49:49.783
SO THAT'S JUST OUR COMMENTARY ON

01:49:49.849 --> 01:49:51.718
THAT MAIN PIECE. OF BUT THERE

01:49:51.785 --> 01:49:54.921
ARE OTHERS AS WELL AND- IT AND

01:49:54.988 --> 01:49:56.823
IF YOU'D LIKE TO DISCUSS THIS

COMMISSION OR FINANCE HAS A

01:49:59.626 --> 01:50:05.398

BIT SLOW BUT WILL BE UP TODAY

01:50:15.642 --> 01:50:17.444

IDENTIFY THE TAX RATE- BUT-

01:50:21.147 --> 01:50:22.449
LARGELY THE STATE'S STEPPING IN

01:50:22.515 --> 01:50:25.085

OUR CLEAN ENERGY GOALS THAT CAN

01:51:46.833 --> 01:51:48.301
REALLY LIFT UP THE REGION. AND

01:51:48.368 --> 01:51:49.569
WE THINK THIS IS A TREMENDOUS

01:51:49.636 --> 01:51:52.138
OPPORTUNITY TO DO IT RIGHT IN A

01:51:52.205 --> 01:51:54.140
WAY THAT ACTUALLY NOT BUILD MORE

01:51:54.207 --> 01:51:56.943
ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN CALIFORNIA

01:51:57.010 --> 01:51:58.945
FOR THAT THE BATTERY SECTOR AND

01:51:59.012 --> 01:52:01.214
THAT CLEAN ENERGY SECTOR IN A

01:52:01.281 --> 01:52:03.249
WAY THAT BENEFITS FOLKS THAT

01:52:03.316 --> 01:52:05.118
LIVE IN THE IMPERIAL THE

01:52:05.185 --> 01:52:07.053
COACHELLA VALLEY AND OF COURSE I

01:52:07.120 --> 01:52:08.455
ALSO BENEFITS SALTON SEA

01:52:08.521 --> 01:52:10.290
RESTORATION THAT'S ONE PIECE. I

01:52:10.356 --> 01:52:12.258
ABSOLUTELY AGREE THAT WE NEED TO

01:52:12.325 --> 01:52:15.328
DO MORE TO STAND UP ECONOMIC

01:52:15.395 --> 01:52:17.263
ACTIVITY ACROSS OUR LANDSCAPE IN

01:52:17.330 --> 01:52:21.434
OUR FORESTS ACTUALLY GET THE-

01:52:21.501 --> 01:52:23.236
VEGETATION OUT OF OUR FORESTS

01:52:23.303 --> 01:52:26.039
THAT ARE BEING- ADDRESSED OR OR

01:52:26.106 --> 01:52:28.041
THIN THROUGH THIS ECOLOGICALLY

01:52:28.108 --> 01:52:29.442
BASED FOREST MANAGEMENT AND

01:52:29.509 --> 01:52:31.211
FRANKLY WHILE THE PUBLIC

01:52:31.277 --> 01:52:32.745
INVESTMENTS ARE REALLY ROBUST

01:52:32.812 --> 01:52:35.348
HUGE THANKS TO YOU ALL- WE NEED

01:52:35.415 --> 01:52:37.016
MORE PRIVATE ECONOMIC ACTIVITY

01:52:37.083 --> 01:52:39.786
SO WE ARE WORK TO STREAMLINE.

01:52:39.853 --> 01:52:41.454
FOR PROJECTS AND WE MADE A

01:52:41.521 --> 01:52:43.790
SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS WITH A

01:52:43.857 --> 01:52:45.191
LARGE PROGRAM WE CALL THE

01:52:45.258 --> 01:52:47.327
VEGETATION TREATMENT PROGRAM-

01:52:47.393 --> 01:52:49.896
PROGRAMMATIC ER WHICH IS A

01:52:49.963 --> 01:52:51.731
MULTIPLE AND I CAN I CAN DETAIL

01:52:51.798 --> 01:52:53.600
THAT BUT THE SHORT OF IT IS

01:52:53.666 --> 01:52:54.501
WORKING TO GET THESE PROJECTS

01:52:54.567 --> 01:52:55.802
DONE MORE QUICKLY AND COST

01:52:55.869 --> 01:52:57.570
EFFECTIVELY AND THEN ALSO AGAIN

01:52:57.637 --> 01:52:59.005
THANKS TO YOUR INVESTMENTS LAST

01:52:59.072 --> 01:53:02.175
YEAR INVEST IN- IN GROWING

01:53:02.242 --> 01:53:04.043
SECTORS FOR THESE PRODUCTS. AND

01:53:04.110 --> 01:53:08.515
WE OBVIOUSLY HAVE. A TIMBER

01:53:08.581 --> 01:53:10.350
INDUSTRY THAT. THAT IS NOT A

01:53:10.416 --> 01:53:11.484
GOOD IN CALIFORNIA AND THERE'S

01:53:11.551 --> 01:53:13.720
ALSO THE BUT FOR USE OF THE

01:53:13.786 --> 01:53:14.187
VEGETATION THAT'S NOT

01:53:14.254 --> 01:53:14.721
NECESSARILY PART OF THAT

01:53:14.787 --> 01:53:16.356
INDUSTRY. I THROUGH THINGS LIKE

01:53:16.422 --> 01:53:18.124
CROSS LAMINATED TIMBER SO

01:53:18.191 --> 01:53:19.425
THERE'S A LOT OF INVESTMENTS

01:53:19.492 --> 01:53:20.493
THROUGH PARTNERS LIKE

01:53:20.560 --> 01:53:22.529
INFRASTRUCTURE BANK WHICH ARE

01:53:22.595 --> 01:53:24.731
HERE TODAY WHO ARE HERE TODAY-

01:53:24.797 --> 01:53:25.698

NEED TO DO BOTH. WE NEED TO.

01:53:28.168 --> 01:53:30.837
ACCELERATE OUR SECTORS TO HELP

01:53:30.904 --> 01:53:32.038
US MANAGE OUR FORESTS AND

01:53:32.105 --> 01:53:34.674
LANDSCAPES AND WE THINK WE NEED

01:53:34.741 --> 01:53:39.179
TO ACCELERATE- SMART LITHIUM

01:53:39.245 --> 01:53:41.214
DEVELOPMENT. OKAY OKAY I GUESS.

01:53:41.281 --> 01:53:43.249
MISTER REAL YOU HAVE SOMETHING

01:53:43.316 --> 01:53:45.118
THAT. I DON'T THINK- GOOD

01:53:45.185 --> 01:53:46.452
MORNING CHAIRED THE NEXT CAREER

01:53:46.519 --> 01:53:47.353
WITH THE ENERGY COMMISSION I

01:53:47.420 --> 01:53:49.322
COULD SPEAK A LITTLE BIT MORE TO

01:53:49.389 --> 01:53:50.623
THE ISSUE OF WITH HIM IF IT-

01:53:50.690 --> 01:53:55.428
PRISONS- COMMITTEE. YEAH SO I

01:53:55.495 --> 01:53:57.230
WOULD I WOULD SHARE THAT AS WE

01:53:57.297 --> 01:53:58.331
KNOW- LITHIUM IS BECOMING AS

01:53:58.398 --> 01:54:00.200
CREDIBLE INCREASINGLY CRITICAL

01:54:00.266 --> 01:54:02.001
RESOURCE FOR THE STATE AND THE

01:54:02.068 --> 01:54:03.169
WORLD AS WE MOVE TOWARD CLEAN

01:54:03.236 --> 01:54:05.138
ENERGY FUTURE TO TACKLE THAT

01:54:05.205 --> 01:54:07.040
BECAUSE I'M A ARE GOING TO TRY

01:54:07.106 --> 01:54:08.608
TO PRESENT ABOUT WE ESTIMATE

01:54:08.675 --> 01:54:10.877
THAT ABOUT A THIRD OF TODAY'S

01:54:10.944 --> 01:54:13.213
GLOBAL LITHIUM THAT MAN COULD

01:54:13.279 --> 01:54:14.380
POTENTIALLY BE UNDER THE

01:54:14.447 --> 01:54:17.083
SOLVENCY THIS IS A CRUCIAL

01:54:17.150 --> 01:54:18.318
INDUSTRY THANKS FOR THE STATE TO

01:54:18.384 --> 01:54:19.485
SUPPORT MUCH LIKE WE SUPPORTED

EASY- INFRASTRUCTURE AND GROWTH

01:54:21.955 --> 01:54:24.157
IN THE STATE. THE BATTERY IN THE

01:54:24.224 --> 01:54:25.959
TECHNOLOGY AND THE FACT

01:54:26.025 --> 01:54:28.194
ECOSYSTEM AROUND THAT WILL BE-

01:54:28.261 --> 01:54:30.029
INCREASINGLY CRITICAL FOR OUR

01:54:30.096 --> 01:54:34.500
GROWTH THAT. THE CLEAN ECONOMY.

01:54:34.567 --> 01:54:37.136

SEE I KNOW YOU HAVE A- READ. A

01:54:38.805 --> 01:54:40.673
PROPOSAL IN THE AND- THE MAY

01:54:40.740 --> 01:54:43.142
REVISE I DIDN'T SEE ANY TRAILER

01:54:43.209 --> 01:54:45.578
LANGUAGE I GUESS MY QUESTION IS

01:54:45.645 --> 01:54:48.514
DID. IS TO ADDRESS ELECTRICITY

01:54:48.581 --> 01:54:50.049
RATES TO PREDETERMINED FIXED

01:54:50.116 --> 01:54:52.719
CHARGES. ISN'T THAT

01:54:52.785 --> 01:54:55.021
CONTROVERSIAL I MEAN THIS IN LOW

01:54:55.088 --> 01:54:56.756
INCOME PEOPLE HAVE A HAVE A

01:54:56.823 --> 01:54:59.292
HARDER TIME PAYING A FIXED RATE

01:54:59.359 --> 01:55:03.129
AND A HIGH INCOME PERSON. I

01:55:03.196 --> 01:55:04.631
MEAN- IT'LL SEND A PRICE SIGNAL

01:55:04.697 --> 01:55:06.566
THAT I CAN I WILL AGREE I'LL

01:55:06.633 --> 01:55:11.404
STIPULATE TO THAT. IT DOESN'T

01:55:11.471 --> 01:55:15.441
ABUSE HE HAVE DISABILITY NOW. GO

01:55:15.508 --> 01:55:21.247
AHEAD. MISTER BAKER. YEAH HELLO

01:55:21.314 --> 01:55:23.049
. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION-

01:55:23.116 --> 01:55:30.256
SENATOR- BEST PC HAS AUTHORITY

01:55:30.323 --> 01:55:32.959
TO- APPROVED RESIDENTIAL FIXED

01:55:33.026 --> 01:55:36.029
CHARGES- THEY A LECTURE BEST

01:55:36.095 --> 01:55:39.332
AROUND UTILITY UP TO A CERTAIN

01:55:39.399 --> 01:55:42.468
STATUTORY CAP AT THIS POINT. AND

01:55:42.535 --> 01:55:45.738
SO WE HAVE SOME AUTHORITY TO DO

01:55:45.805 --> 01:55:48.441
THAT. BUT WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS

01:55:48.508 --> 01:55:51.010
THAT CUSTOMERS OF THE ELECTRIC

01:55:51.077 --> 01:55:52.578
VALUE THIRD RANKING RATE

01:55:52.645 --> 01:55:53.913
PRESSURES. DUE TO WILDFIRE

01:55:53.980 --> 01:55:55.214
RELATED TRANSMISSION AND

01:55:55.281 --> 01:55:56.716
DISTRIBUTION COSTS AMONG OTHER

01:55:56.783 --> 01:55:59.585
FACTORS AND CURRENTLY MOST

01:55:59.652 --> 01:56:02.021
ELECTRIC ARE YOU FOR ARE

01:56:02.088 --> 01:56:05.491
COLLECTED THROUGH CHARGES. AND

01:56:05.558 --> 01:56:07.160
THAT CREATES. AN ECHO ACROSS

01:56:07.226 --> 01:56:09.195
RECOVERY- ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE

01:56:09.262 --> 01:56:11.064
CUSTOMERS THAT CAN'T AFFORD TO

01:56:11.130 --> 01:56:13.499
REDUCE THEIR CONSUMPTION-

01:56:13.566 --> 01:56:14.567
THROUGH DISTRIBUTING YOUR

01:56:14.634 --> 01:56:16.469
RESOURCES ADOPTION AND WHAT HAVE

01:56:16.536 --> 01:56:19.305
YOU AND SO HI BIOMETRIC CHARGES

01:56:19.372 --> 01:56:21.541
THEY ALSO CREATE A BARRIER TO

01:56:21.607 --> 01:56:24.077
ELECTRIFICATION. AND DEATH RATE

01:56:24.143 --> 01:56:26.079
REFORM PROPOSAL WOULD ALLOW THE

01:56:26.145 --> 01:56:27.480
FEW KEY TO REDUCED CHARGES.

01:56:27.547 --> 01:56:29.849
ATTACHED TO VOLUMES OF

01:56:29.916 --> 01:56:31.184
ELECTRICITY CONSUMED IT WOULD

01:56:31.250 --> 01:56:33.186
ALSO ELP TO CONTROL RATE

01:56:33.252 --> 01:56:35.922
VOLATILITY. AND ENABLE I HAVE A

01:56:35.988 --> 01:56:38.157
BETTER PRICE SIGNALS TO ENHANCE

01:56:38.224 --> 01:56:42.495
THE WIDESPREAD ELECTRIFICATION

01:56:42.562 --> 01:56:43.696
EFFORT YOU. YOU ABOUT WHETHER OR

01:56:43.763 --> 01:56:45.665
NOT IT. THIS PROPOSAL

01:56:45.732 --> 01:56:49.202
CONTROVERSIAL. YOU SEE HOW THEY

01:56:49.268 --> 01:56:53.373
- AND KANBAN. ON A RACE AND A-

01:56:53.439 --> 01:56:54.407
THAT PASSED FEBRUARY WHAT ARE

01:56:54.474 --> 01:56:56.709
SECOND HEARING ON THAT MATTER

01:56:56.776 --> 01:56:57.677
OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS AND

01:56:57.744 --> 01:56:59.245
WE'VE BEEN REPORTING ON THAT TO

01:56:59.312 --> 01:57:01.214
THE LEGISLATURE THROUGH OUR SB

01:57:01.280 --> 01:57:03.950
SIX NINETY FIVE REPORT. AND WE

01:57:04.016 --> 01:57:05.485
OBSERVE THAT RESIDENTIAL FIXED

01:57:05.551 --> 01:57:08.654
CHARGE RATE REFORM WAS. AMONG

01:57:08.721 --> 01:57:10.490
THE STAKEHOLDER PROPOSALS THAT

01:57:10.556 --> 01:57:12.358
APPEAR TO HAVE. BEEN BROAD

01:57:12.425 --> 01:57:15.461
SUPPORT- ACROSS A NUMBER OF

01:57:15.528 --> 01:57:16.596
DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDER GROUPS.

01:57:16.662 --> 01:57:18.664
AND SO WE SEE THAT THAT- I KEEP

01:57:18.731 --> 01:57:20.800
STRATEGY FOR OPENING UP

01:57:20.867 --> 01:57:25.238
OPPORTUNITIES- FOR. FURTHER

01:57:25.304 --> 01:57:27.573
PARTICIPATION BY CUSTOMERS AND

01:57:27.640 --> 01:57:30.743
IN- ELECTRIFICATION OPPORTUNITY

01:57:30.810 --> 01:57:35.281
AND WE'RE ALSO PROPOSING TO- AND

01:57:35.348 --> 01:57:39.552
THAT- STATUTORY CHANGE DIRECT

01:57:39.619 --> 01:57:42.021
THE PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSION TO

01:57:42.088 --> 01:57:45.658
INCORPORATE- AT IN AND INCOME

01:57:45.725 --> 01:57:48.728
TAX INCOME FACTOR IN AND HOW-

01:57:48.795 --> 01:57:51.097
ANY- FIXED CHARGES ARE ARE

01:57:51.164 --> 01:57:54.534
STRUCTURED. IT WOULD ALSO BRING

01:57:54.600 --> 01:58:01.073
THE- ELECTRIC- I'LL YOU UP MORE

01:58:01.140 --> 01:58:03.576
IN LINE WITH WHAT WE'RE SEEING-

01:58:03.643 --> 01:58:05.144
ELSEWHERE IN THE INDUSTRY.

01:58:05.211 --> 01:58:06.612
CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA'S ELECTRIC

01:58:06.679 --> 01:58:10.383
I USE THAT ARE- ONE OF THE FEW

01:58:10.450 --> 01:58:11.417
ELECTRIC UTILITY. OFF THE

01:58:11.484 --> 01:58:13.352
COUNTRY THAT DON'T HAVE BIG

01:58:13.419 --> 01:58:14.720
CHARGES- IT'S VERY COMMON

01:58:14.787 --> 01:58:17.490
ANOTHER INDUSTRY AND- FOR

01:58:17.557 --> 01:58:19.258
EXAMPLE THAT SACRAMENTO

01:58:19.325 --> 01:58:20.493
MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT HAS

01:58:20.560 --> 01:58:23.329
A- TWENTY DOLLAR PER CHARGE AND

01:58:23.396 --> 01:58:25.998
I THINK THAT THE COURT HAS A

01:58:26.065 --> 01:58:27.667
SEVEN DOLLAR. CHARGE AND SO-

01:58:27.733 --> 01:58:31.437
THAT WAS- THE PURPOSE IS TO-

01:58:31.504 --> 01:58:33.306
PROVIDE MORE FLEXIBILITY THAT

01:58:33.372 --> 01:58:35.341
THE PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSION TO

01:58:35.408 --> 01:58:37.143
BE ABLE TO CONSIDER THIS ISSUE

01:58:37.210 --> 01:58:39.245
RIGHT OKAY ONE MIGHT WE ARE

01:58:39.312 --> 01:58:41.981
EXPECTED BUDGET TRAILER BILL TO

01:58:42.048 --> 01:58:43.516
EXPLAIN THIS IN. A GREATER

01:58:43.583 --> 01:58:47.153
DETAIL OR LANGUAGE FORGET THIS

01:58:47.220 --> 01:58:50.056
LANGUAGE YOU HAVE AN IDEA HI

01:58:50.122 --> 01:58:51.424
JERRY THIS IS M. IN OUR

01:58:51.491 --> 01:58:53.125
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND

01:58:53.192 --> 01:58:54.293
EXPECTING IT TO BE UP THIS WEEK

01:58:54.360 --> 01:58:56.395
EXCELLENT BECAUSE WE DO YOU KNOW

01:58:56.462 --> 01:58:58.331
WHICH WE SEE ONE POINT TWO

01:58:58.397 --> 01:59:01.601
BILLION TO PLAY ELECTRIC ARREARS

01:59:01.667 --> 01:59:03.703
WHICH IS ACCEPTABLE WHEN WE WANT

01:59:03.769 --> 01:59:05.304
TO DO THAT BUT THEN WE'RE GOING

01:59:05.371 --> 01:59:06.572
TO RAISE THE RATES GOING FORWARD

01:59:06.639 --> 01:59:08.875
YOU CAN SEE WHY SOME MEMBERS

01:59:08.941 --> 01:59:10.243
MIGHT. BE CONSIDERED CONCERN I

01:59:10.309 --> 01:59:13.212
MISS ELLERS AND WHOEVER'S AT

01:59:13.279 --> 01:59:15.581
THAT- ALLEY- I GOT A QUESTION ON

01:59:15.648 --> 01:59:18.217
THE CAP AND TRADE- YOU HE- I

01:59:18.284 --> 01:59:20.253
KNOW THERE'S AN AUCTION

01:59:20.319 --> 01:59:21.921
TOMORROW- IT SEEMS LIKE PRICES

01:59:21.988 --> 01:59:23.356
ARE GOING UP IN THAT THAT. IN

01:59:23.422 --> 01:59:26.759
GAS- IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE THAT

01:59:26.826 --> 01:59:28.895
WE DON'T. RECEIVE OVER A BILLION

01:59:28.961 --> 01:59:31.063
DOLLARS IN DEBT I'M ON THE

01:59:31.130 --> 01:59:32.865
NUMBERS AGAIN THIS IS MY SEVENTH

01:59:32.932 --> 01:59:35.401
YEAR IS SEAT CHAIR NOT MY SIX

01:59:35.468 --> 01:59:37.436
YEARS THAT YEAR SO EVERY YEAR WE

01:59:37.503 --> 01:59:39.138
HAVE THIS DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT

01:59:39.205 --> 01:59:41.340
THE ANTICIPATED REVENUE AS AN-

01:59:41.407 --> 01:59:42.708
IN. AND MY UNDERSTANDING WERE

01:59:42.775 --> 01:59:44.410
ABOUT SIX HUNDRED MILLION

01:59:44.477 --> 01:59:47.280
DOLLARS LESS OR ABOVE WHAT THE

LIMITING THAT THE STATE LIMITED

02:03:16.655 --> 02:03:17.423
RESOURCES THERE SO IT'S A

02:03:17.490 --> 02:03:18.924
HUNDRED DOLLAR PROPOSED. FOR

ANDREAS CLIMATE REALLY ACTED.

02:03:24.964 --> 02:03:25.498
AND THROUGH YEAH- WELL THAT

02:03:25.564 --> 02:03:26.532
AMOUNT MONEY IS KIND OF REALLY

TO SORT OF FLAG. ONE OTHER

02:03:30.770 --> 02:03:31.637
QUESTION AGAIN WORK THESE ARE

02:03:31.704 --> 02:03:33.439
ALL PROPOSALS THAT WERE KIND OF

02:03:33.506 --> 02:03:34.406
CONTINUING TO LOOK INTO JUST ONE

02:03:34.473 --> 02:03:35.674
OTHER ISSUE ON THE METHANE

02:03:35.741 --> 02:03:36.942
MONITORING PROPOSAL- WE'RE STILL

02:03:37.009 --> 02:03:38.344
TRYING TO GET SOME OF THE

02:03:38.410 --> 02:03:39.545
DETAILS ON EXACTLY HOW THAT.

02:03:39.612 --> 02:03:41.747
MONEY WOULD BE SPENT SAID OUR

02:03:41.814 --> 02:03:42.381
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT SOME OF

02:03:42.448 --> 02:03:44.350
THAT WOULD BE SPENT TO- HELP

02:03:44.416 --> 02:03:45.651
KIND OF WATCH SOME OF THE-

02:03:45.718 --> 02:03:47.820
SATELLITE- BUT THERE ALSO MIGHT

02:03:47.887 --> 02:03:50.322
BE SOME KIND OF ONGOING. COSTS

02:03:50.389 --> 02:03:51.357
FOR DATA COLLECTION THAT THOSE

02:03:51.423 --> 02:03:53.425
COSTS- DON'T APPEAR TO BE THERE

02:03:53.492 --> 02:03:55.895
ARE ANY KIND OF ONGOING SPENDING

02:03:55.961 --> 02:03:57.329
PROPOSALS AS PART OF THIS THAT'S

02:03:57.396 --> 02:03:58.197
ANOTHER. I FISCAL CONSIDERATION

IF YOU THINK ABOUT. YOU KNOW

02:03:59.765 --> 02:04:01.100
WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED HERE AND

02:04:01.167 --> 02:04:02.468
WHETHER OR NOT IT MIGHT CREATE

02:04:02.535 --> 02:04:03.736
SORT OF MORE ONGOING COST SO

02:04:03.803 --> 02:04:04.937
THAT'S SOMETHING WILL CONTINUE

02:04:05.004 --> 02:04:06.372

PROVIDE COMMENTS TO YOU AND WHAT

02:04:09.108 --> 02:04:10.810
IS THE GO. YEAH I GUESS I MEAN

02:04:10.876 --> 02:04:13.913
WE KNOW SOURCE OF METHANE OUR

02:04:13.979 --> 02:04:15.347
GARY FARMS OR LIFE. WE'VE GOT

02:04:15.414 --> 02:04:18.584
INFORMATION NOW THAT IN HAWAII

02:04:18.651 --> 02:04:19.385
THEY HAVE SOME SEAWEED

02:04:19.451 --> 02:04:20.486
PRODUCTION THAT WE CAN FEED TO

02:04:20.553 --> 02:04:23.989
THAT THE- ANIMALS AND REDUCE THE

02:04:24.056 --> 02:04:25.491
AMOUNT OF BELCHING AND BLAH BLAH

02:04:25.558 --> 02:04:28.060
BLAH WE'VE GOT. AMPLE WE'VE GOT.

02:04:28.127 --> 02:04:30.129
THAT GESTURES WE KNOW IF WE PUT

02:04:30.196 --> 02:04:31.096
IN SEVENTEEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR

02:04:31.163 --> 02:04:33.365
JURY DIGESTED TO SUBSIDIZE IT WE

02:04:33.432 --> 02:04:35.701
GET ONE. POINT TWO MILLION

METRIC TONS OF CARBON REDUCTION

02:04:37.837 --> 02:04:40.472
. RIGHT SO. SO AND WE KNOW WHERE

02:04:40.539 --> 02:04:42.408
OF THE DERRY'S NOT HIDING I MEAN

02:04:42.474 --> 02:04:44.510
I GUESS THERE COULD BE SOME

02:04:44.577 --> 02:04:45.344
CALLOUS SOMEWHERE WE KNOW WHERE

02:04:45.411 --> 02:04:46.612
THEY ARE OUR LANDFILLS ARE. YOU

02:04:46.679 --> 02:04:49.815
KNOW WE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO GET

02:04:49.882 --> 02:04:51.250
ON THE BACKSIDE OF LANDFILL WE

02:04:51.317 --> 02:04:52.518
KNOW ON THE FRONT SIDE WHAT HOW

02:04:52.585 --> 02:04:54.253
MUCH METHANE SUBMITTING WE KNOW

02:04:54.320 --> 02:04:55.921
FROM OUR- SEWAGE TREATMENT

02:04:55.988 --> 02:04:56.789
PLANTS WERE THE METHODS IT'S-

02:04:56.856 --> 02:04:58.524
LIKE THERE'S- SOME SURPRISES

02:04:58.591 --> 02:05:00.226
THERE SOME. UNKNOWN SOURCE OF

02:05:00.292 --> 02:05:03.295
METHANE OUT THERE I MEAN. THAT

02:05:03.362 --> 02:05:05.965
I'M GOING TO WE'LL GET IT FOR A

02:05:06.031 --> 02:05:07.066
HUNDRED MILLION WE'RE GONNA

02:05:07.132 --> 02:05:13.405
KNOW. OF FINANCE OR MISS. HE

02:05:13.472 --> 02:05:17.009
ELAINE- HI MELISSA THIS ON THE

02:05:17.076 --> 02:05:19.378
RESEARCH CHIEF CAR- AND I WANT

02:05:19.445 --> 02:05:21.547
TO GO TO ABOUT OF THESE OFFICER

02:05:21.614 --> 02:05:23.315
THAT THEY LEAVE TO RUN TO MAKE

02:05:23.382 --> 02:05:25.985
SO WE WORK WITH BROAD RULE AND

02:05:26.051 --> 02:05:27.553
THAT ARE IN PLACE SO YOU'LL BE

02:05:27.620 --> 02:05:30.923
ABLE TO TEN EXACTLY- WHERE

02:05:30.990 --> 02:05:32.491
ANIMATION IS COMING FROM FOR

02:05:32.558 --> 02:05:34.526
EXAMPLE A LEAK FROM THE TANK-

02:05:34.593 --> 02:05:36.462
AND YOU'LL BE ABLE TO DO THAT

02:05:36.528 --> 02:05:37.529
WITH THESE ADDITIONAL EIGHT

02:05:37.596 --> 02:05:39.131
SATELLITES MUCH MORE QUICKLY SO

02:05:39.198 --> 02:05:41.400
IT ALLOWS US TO LOOK AT OVER 80%

02:05:41.467 --> 02:05:42.768
OF NOTHING AT THE MEETING

02:05:42.835 --> 02:05:45.137
INFRASTRUCTURE EVERY TWO WEEKS.

02:05:45.204 --> 02:05:46.906
AND THEN WITH THAT WE CAN WORK

02:05:46.972 --> 02:05:48.140
WITH OUR REGULATORY PROGRAMS

02:05:48.207 --> 02:05:49.808
MORE EFFECTIVELY IMPLEMENT AND

02:05:49.875 --> 02:05:52.244
ENFORCE THOSE REGULATIONS- AND

02:05:52.311 --> 02:05:54.613
GET REDUCTIONS NOW AND THAT'S

02:05:54.680 --> 02:05:56.248
IMPORTANT FOR METHANE ESPECIALLY

02:05:56.315 --> 02:05:57.716
BECAUSE A SHORT LIVED CLIMATE

02:05:57.783 --> 02:05:59.385
POLLUTANT AND ANY REDUCTION WE

02:05:59.451 --> 02:06:03.188
HAVE NOW WILL HAVE A SOONER FAT-

02:06:03.255 --> 02:06:05.925
TO UP WITH NUMBER SEVEN THERE

02:06:05.991 --> 02:06:06.992
HOW DOES THAT WORK THROUGH A I

02:06:07.059 --> 02:06:09.128
GOT A THE PAETUS CALIFORNIA I'VE

02:06:09.194 --> 02:06:11.764
A LANDFILL IT'S EMITTING METHANE

02:06:11.830 --> 02:06:13.299
RIGHT NOW THE SATELLITE GOES UP

02:06:13.365 --> 02:06:16.869
IT'S SO WRONG IT'S NOT TEN IT'S

02:06:16.936 --> 02:06:17.870
TWENTY FIVE HOW DO YOU CHANGE

02:06:17.937 --> 02:06:20.172
THAT HOW DO YOU GO OUT TO THE

02:06:20.239 --> 02:06:21.373
LANDFILL AND IMMEDIATELY YOU

02:06:21.440 --> 02:06:23.475
KNOW WITH THE WITH THE LOCAL

02:06:23.542 --> 02:06:29.982
AIRPORT HAVE YES STOP THAT. SO

02:06:30.049 --> 02:06:30.582
THERE'S VERY DIFFERENTLY THAT

02:06:30.649 --> 02:06:32.151
THE ON WHAT YOU'RE SOURCE IS-

02:06:32.217 --> 02:06:34.320
IT'S FOR THE OF WELL I DON'T.

02:06:34.386 --> 02:06:35.521
THEN IF YOU SEE THAT A INSPECTOR

02:06:35.587 --> 02:06:37.923
SOMEBODY EVELYN CAN GO OUT FIND

02:06:37.990 --> 02:06:39.091
WHERE IT IS AND SOMETIMES IT'S

02:06:39.158 --> 02:06:42.061
AS SIMPLE AS CLOSING OF DAHLE-

02:06:42.127 --> 02:06:43.228
THERE'S BEEN INSTANCES WHERE A

02:06:43.295 --> 02:06:45.464
TANK HATCHES OPEN AND IT'S

02:06:45.531 --> 02:06:47.366
CLOSING OUT OF TEN CATS. YOU MAY

02:06:47.433 --> 02:06:49.768
NOT FIND NOT FOR A WHILE BUT IF

02:06:49.835 --> 02:06:50.836
YOU HAVE THESE OVERFLIGHTS

02:06:50.903 --> 02:06:51.437
HAPPENING WITH THE SATELLITES

02:06:51.503 --> 02:06:52.771
HAPPENING YOU'LL FIND OUT RIGHT

THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S THERE AND

02:07:31.543 --> 02:07:33.879
IT'LL TAKE A TWELVE MONTHS OR

02:07:33.946 --> 02:07:35.514
EIGHTEEN MONTHS THE TO DO THIS.

02:07:35.581 --> 02:07:37.316
WHY WOULD YOU NOT COUPLE THE

02:07:37.383 --> 02:07:40.219
PROPOSAL OF MONITORING AND GET

FINANCE I'LL JUST KIND OF-

02:08:01.140 --> 02:08:02.541
TALKED THE POINT ABOUT WHY

02:08:02.608 --> 02:08:05.411
SPECIFICALLY THE ADMINISTRATION.

02:08:05.477 --> 02:08:07.212

WHY WE ARE PROPOSED TO UTILIZE

02:08:14.453 --> 02:08:15.754
THOSE FUNDS SPECIFICALLY IS-

02:08:15.821 --> 02:08:17.790
MAINLY A LINE. THROUGH THE THAT

02:08:17.856 --> 02:08:19.725
THE PURPOSE OF EUROPE AND

02:08:19.792 --> 02:08:21.527
REDUCING OUR GREENHOUSE GAS

02:08:21.593 --> 02:08:23.028
EMISSIONS YOU KNOW METHANE IS

02:08:23.095 --> 02:08:24.229
THAT CONSIDERED ONE OF THE MOST

02:08:24.296 --> 02:08:26.799
- SHORT LIVED AT POLLUTANT GASES

02:08:26.865 --> 02:08:28.233
OUT THERE. AND GIVEN THAT THIS

02:08:28.300 --> 02:08:29.935

HIDING GOOD AND NEXUS. THAT'S

02:08:46.351 --> 02:08:47.219
THE MAIN REASON WHY WE

02:08:47.286 --> 02:08:49.088
PRIORITIZE UTILIZING THE DRAFT

02:08:49.154 --> 02:08:55.294

EXTREME HEAT THEY MITIGATE

02:13:03.675 --> 02:13:07.512
FLOODING THE IMPROVE AIR AND

OF BANG FOR THE BUCK HERE AND I

02:13:18.857 --> 02:13:20.258
SHARE SENATOR MCGUIRE'S

02:13:20.325 --> 02:13:23.562
FRUSTRATION ABOUT THIS NOT BEING

02:13:23.628 --> 02:13:26.164
FUNDED AND I CAN'T FIGURE OUT

02:13:26.231 --> 02:13:27.766
WHY AND TO THE NOTION THAT

02:13:27.833 --> 02:13:29.501
CALIFORNIA MAY BE HALFWAY THERE

02:13:29.568 --> 02:13:32.604
ARE GETTING CLOSE TO BEING.

02:13:32.671 --> 02:13:35.374
PARK- YOU KNOW HAVING ENOUGH

02:13:35.440 --> 02:13:37.609

02:13:37.676 --> 02:13:38.844
PUBLIC LAND'S ANNUAL PARK SCORE

02:13:38.910 --> 02:13:40.746
CAME OUT A LITTLE WHILE AGO

02:13:40.812 --> 02:13:42.280
SEVEN CALIFORNIA CITIES ARE IN

02:13:42.347 --> 02:13:44.216
THE BOTTOM 25% OF THE LARGEST

02:13:44.282 --> 02:13:46.585
CITIES IN THE US WHEN IT COMES

02:13:46.651 --> 02:13:49.788
TO PARK ACCESS- AND- A LIST OF.

02:13:49.855 --> 02:13:51.857
UP SEVEN DIFFERENT SENATORS AND

SEVEN DIFFERENT DISTRICTS THE A

02:13:53.458 --> 02:13:57.095
REPRESENT THOSE CITIES. AND WHEN

02:13:57.162 --> 02:13:58.196
WE TALK ABOUT VULNERABLE

02:13:58.263 --> 02:14:00.232
COMMUNITIES. IF YOU'RE PARK POOR

02:14:00.298 --> 02:14:02.200
YOU ARE VULNERABLE BECAUSE THERE

02:14:02.267 --> 02:14:05.003
IS A 1100% CORRELATION BETWEEN

02:14:05.070 --> 02:14:07.572
LOW INCOME. AND PARK POOR AND

02:14:07.639 --> 02:14:09.408
LOW INCOME MEANS HIGHER OBESITY

02:14:09.474 --> 02:14:12.144
RATES MORE UNDERLYING CONDITIONS

02:14:12.210 --> 02:14:14.579
AND MORE- THREAT TO THE

02:14:14.646 --> 02:14:16.415

HARBOR CRAFT AND BASICALLY

02:14:53.518 --> 02:14:55.954
REQUIRED- OVERHAULING OF THE

02:14:56.021 --> 02:14:58.557
FLEET FOR A VARIETY OF HARBOR

CRAFT VESSELS INCLUDING FERRIES-

02:15:01.293 --> 02:15:02.594
WE WORK CONSTRUCTIVELY WITH

02:15:02.661 --> 02:15:05.597
CARBONTHAT BUT THE REALITY IS

02:15:05.664 --> 02:15:07.732
THAT- IN ORDER TO GET THE

02:15:07.799 --> 02:15:08.467
EMISSIONS REDUCTION IN THE

02:15:08.533 --> 02:15:10.402
GREENHOUSE GAS BENEFITS. WE WERE

02:15:10.469 --> 02:15:12.771
GOING TO HAVE TO REPLACE ALL OF

02:15:12.838 --> 02:15:14.539
OUR FERRIES THEY COST TWENTY

02:15:14.606 --> 02:15:15.874
MILLION DOLLARS A VESSEL TO

02:15:15.941 --> 02:15:18.076
REPLACE WE HAVE- TO THE PURITY

02:15:18.143 --> 02:15:19.411
YEARS TO DO IT BUT SOME OF THE

02:15:19.478 --> 02:15:22.447
BEST REPLACEMENTS HAVE TO START

02:15:22.514 --> 02:15:28.019
IMMEDIATELY. SO OUR. SIX NEW

02:15:28.086 --> 02:15:32.257
VESSELS OVERTIME. THE THE

02:15:32.324 --> 02:15:33.925
PROBLEM WE HAVE IS THAT THE

02:15:33.992 --> 02:15:35.961
EXISTING FUNDING PROGRAMS FOR A

02:15:36.027 --> 02:15:38.330
MORE FOR EXAMPLE. IT'S ONLY A

02:15:38.396 --> 02:15:39.531
HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION A YEAR

02:15:39.598 --> 02:15:41.199
AND ITS OVER SUBSCRIBED IN SOUTH

02:15:41.266 --> 02:15:42.334
BECAUSE THERE'S NO MONEY

02:15:42.400 --> 02:15:44.569
AVAILABLE IN THIS FUNDING CYCLE

02:15:44.636 --> 02:15:47.072
. SO WHAT REDUCE ASKING IS FOR

02:15:47.138 --> 02:15:50.041
TWO THINGS ONE IS- WE HAVE A

02:15:50.108 --> 02:15:51.543
MEMBER REQUESTS IN THE ASSEMBLY

02:15:51.610 --> 02:15:53.278
SIDE BUT WE'RE TRYING TO SEE IF

02:15:53.345 --> 02:15:55.514
WE CAN FIND A PART OF FUNDING.

02:15:55.580 --> 02:15:56.348
THAT COULD BE AVAILABLE FOR

02:15:56.414 --> 02:15:59.017
FERRIES WE'RE NOT ASKING FOR A

02:15:59.084 --> 02:16:01.253
100% BUT SOME MATCHING THAT

02:16:01.319 --> 02:16:03.622
BECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE. THERE ARE

02:16:03.688 --> 02:16:05.423
FAIRIES WHO ARE OPERATED BY

02:16:05.490 --> 02:16:08.660
PUBLIC ENTITIES- WHO HAVE THE

02:16:08.727 --> 02:16:09.761
ABILITY TO FUND SOMETHING LIKE

02:16:09.828 --> 02:16:11.530
THIS. CATALINA CHANNEL EXPRESS

02:16:11.596 --> 02:16:13.598
IS A PRIVATE COMPANY. THEY CAN'T

02:16:13.665 --> 02:16:15.634
GET FINANCING FOR TWENTY MILLION

02:16:15.700 --> 02:16:17.602
YOU CAN UP THE FAIREST POSSIBLY

02:16:17.669 --> 02:16:19.871
HIGH ENOUGH THE RECOVERY. AND SO

02:16:19.938 --> 02:16:21.806
WITHOUT STATE FUNDING IT'S NOT

02:16:21.873 --> 02:16:25.544
FINANCE RIPPLE ON AND SO- WE

02:16:25.610 --> 02:16:26.311
WERE LOOKING FOR A GRANT

02:16:26.378 --> 02:16:29.848
PROGRAM- ONE IDEA- AND I THINK

02:16:29.915 --> 02:16:31.750
FINANCES LOOKING AT THIS IS.

02:16:31.816 --> 02:16:33.919
THERE TO SIX HUNDRED MILLION

02:16:33.985 --> 02:16:36.488
DOLLAR- SPENDING- PROPOSAL IN

02:16:36.555 --> 02:16:38.790

ROAD VEHICLES TRUCKS AND OTHERS-

02:16:41.359 --> 02:16:43.495
AND- THAT WOULD BE ONE PLACE

02:16:43.562 --> 02:16:45.864
THAT WE COULD TRY TO INCLUDE-

02:16:45.931 --> 02:16:48.667
YOU SEE REGULATED COMMON CARRIER

02:16:48.733 --> 02:16:50.602
FERRIES FOR- FUNDING. AND THE

02:16:50.669 --> 02:16:52.704
OTHER WOULD BE JUST TO HAVE A

02:16:52.771 --> 02:16:55.240
COMPETITIVE POT FOR- THE PC

02:16:55.307 --> 02:16:56.741
REGULATED FERRIES THAT ARE

02:16:56.808 --> 02:16:58.577
PRIVATE ENTITIES. SO THEY CAN

02:16:58.643 --> 02:17:00.912
COMPETE FOR THE FUNDING. SO

02:17:00.979 --> 02:17:02.380
