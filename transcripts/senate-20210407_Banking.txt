MY FRIEND HERE DALY HERE THERE ARE STILL HERE THEY'RE ALSO HERE LET'S OF MEDICINE. SO HERE MEN YEAR MAN HERE PORTANTINO I'M HERE TO PORTANTINO HERE YOU HAVE A QUORUM THANK YOU NOW THAT WE'VE ESTABLISHED QUORUM AT LIKE TO WELCOME SENATOR HERTZBERG WHO WILL BE PRESENTING SB SIX THREE EIGHT YOU MAY PROCEED SENATOR HERTZBERG THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. YOU KNOW HOW THE RATE OF CHANGE WE ARE EXPERIENCING IS NOTHING LESS THAN EXTRAORDINARY WHEN I SERVED IN GOVERNMENT BEFORE GOOGLE WASN'T INCORPORATED. AND I LEFT IN MANY YEARS AFTERWARDS THE IPHONE WAS INTRODUCED. THINGS ARE CHANGING AT A RAPID PACE AND SO WHEN I CAME BACK I PARTNERED WITH WITH- FORMER MAJORITY LEADER IAN CALDERON IN LOOKING AT TECHNOLOGY TECHNOLOGICAL ISSUES FACING THE STATE. THAT OFTEN ARE NOT THE PART OF THE DISCUSSION WE HAVE BECAUSE ARE NOT YET ADOPTED BY INTEREST GROUPS. AND IT'S CHALLENGING TO INVENT THE FUTURE. AND SO WE BOTH EMBARKED ON THIS DISCUSSION F BLOCKCHAIN. WEEK PASSED IN THIS LEGISLATURE THE GOVERNOR SIGNED SOME YEARS AGO A BILL WITH A BILL THAT'S RELATED TO THIS MEASURE THAT WE HAVE HERE TODAY WHICH BY THE WAY I'M TAKING THE AMENDMENTS ON ON. THAT THAT AUTHORIZED BLOCKCHAIN. TO BE USED FOR SHAREHOLDERS IN A SMALL PART OF THE HELD CORPORATIONS WE FOUND. THAT OFTEN IN BANKING TRANSACTIONS. WHEN CENTER BRADFORD IS HERE BEFORE WHEN THIS WAS PRESENTED WHEN HE WAS SHARE. WHERE WE HAD FRAUD IN CASES WHERE SOMEONE CAME IN. A DOCTORED UP A RESOLUTION AND OPEN UP A BANK ACCOUNT NOW WITH THE RELAY JUROR FOR SHAREHOLDING INTEREST IT'S IT BECOMES IMPOSSIBLE TO DO THAT. AND SO WE DID THAT AND THEN SUBSEQUENT TO THAT. WHICH IS RELATED TO THIS LEGISLATION SENATOR EXCUSE ME MAJORITY LEADER CALDERON A NIGHT OF CREATED TO LEGISLATION ADOPTED. BY BOTH HOUSES AND SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR. A CALIFORNIA BLOCKCHAIN GROUP WORKING GROUP THAT WE WERE BOTH PART OF THE IMPACT OF THAT WORKING GROUP WAS TO BRING EXPERTS TOGETHER. AND HELP DEFINE WHAT BLOCKCHAIN IS THAT DEFINITION IS INCLUDED HERE IN THIS MEASURE AS A RESULT OF THAT HOMEWORK. IS A DECENTRALIZED DATA SYSTEM. I JUST WANT TO SHOW YOU KNOW A COUPLE OF THOUGHTS AND ALL. WILL MAKE IT MUCH LONGER. BROCHURE THREE QUOTES THAT HELP INFORM THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE. I THINK THERE'S A WORLD MARKET FOR MAYBE FIVE COMPUTERS THOMAS WATSON CHAIRMAN IBM NINETEEN FORTY THREE. IF I WERE RUNNING APPLE I WOULD MELT THE MACINTOSH FOR ALL IT'S WORTH AND GET BUSY ON THE NEXT THING THE PC WARS ARE OVER BY WE'RE STEVE JOBS I WOULD SHUT DOWN APPLE AND GIVE THE MONEY BACK TO THE SHAREHOLDERS MICHAEL DELL CHAIRMAN AND CEO OF DELL COMPUTERS NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN. THERE'S NOT A CHANCE THAT THE IPHONE IS GOING TO GET ANY SIGNIFICANT MARKET SARE NO CHANCE THE CEO OF MICROSOFT. TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN. THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT THERE ARE THINGS SOMETIMES AT WORK AND DON'T WORK. BUT WE'RE CALIFORNIA WE'VE GOT TO BE ON THE CUTTING EDGE AND SO WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH THIS MEASURE VERY BRIEFLY IS ONE WITH THE COMMITTEE MOMENTS EXTENDING. THIS MEASURE THAT WE ADOPTED A FEW YEARS AGO RELATING TO SHAREHOLDING CORPORATIONS BY FIVE YEARS. FURTHER DELAY WAS WE KIND OF TOOK A HIATUS IN WORKING ON THE- ON THE WORKING GROUP. AND SECONDLY TO INCORPORATE THE DEFINITION OF DECENTRALIZED DATA SYSTEMS. WHICH IS THE DEFINITION THAT CAME OUT OF THE HARD WORK. OF THE BLOCKCHAIN WORKING GROUP AS A RESULT OF LEGISLATION PASSED. SO I WOULD ASK YOU AYE VOTE AND BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY I THINK. HE DOES WE DEAL WITH ISSUES EVERY DAY WAS SOCIAL CHALLENGES WITH THE SOCIAL CONTRACT. FOR THE RICH POOR DIVIDE THAT OCCUPIES MY THINKING TREMENDOUSLY. IT'S IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT THESE CUTTING EDGE IDEAS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR HAS DONE EXTRAORDINARY THINGS. GROCERY PROVIDERS ARE USING BLOCKCHAIN TO TRACE. FOOD TO LOOK FOR CONTAMINATION OR ILLNESS- THE PRIME MINISTER OF AND I WANT TO WHO I. MET WITH HIS USING BLOCKCHAIN TO RECORD ALL REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS TO AVOID FRAUD- YOU KNOW YOU SEE THESE IBM COMMERCIALS ON TV USING BLOCKCHAINS TO TRACE. WE DON'T KNOW ULTIMATELY WHAT IS GOING TO BE ABOUT RIGHT NOW ITS CRYPTOCURRENCY INS LARGE MEASURE THE INTERNET WAS LARGELY **** WHEN IT STARTED OUT. AND IT'S BECOME A FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENT TARA TRAINER KIDS AT HOME AS WE FACE THIS PANDEMIC CHALLENGES AND SO MANY MORE THINGS THAT RELATE TO OUR SOCIETY. SO WE'RE CALIFORNIA WE INVENT THE FUTURE AND THIS IS JUST ONE SMALL STEP. IN SOMETHING WHERE WE I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE THE DISCIPLINE. AS A LEGISLATURE NASA GOVERNMENT TO LOOK INTO THE EYES OF THE FUTURE AND DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO TRY TO HELP GUIDE AND INVENTED I HAVE THREE SUPPORTERS MEASURE. YEAH WE HAVE A WITNESS ON THE LINE A MANAGER. THREE THANK YOU SENATOR HERTZBERG WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO WITNESSES TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT WE HAVE. BRINLEY LEARN. FROM THE BLOCKCHAIN ADVOCACY COALITION ON THE LINE. THANK YOU SO MUCH IT'S FRIENDLIER AND I COULDN'T AGREE MORE THAT WE ARE CALIFORNIA AND WE ARE HERE TO INVENT THE FUTURE.

RECORDING STOCK ISSUANCES USE CASE THAT WORKS ESPECIALLY WELL WITH BLOCKCHAIN AND IT DEMONSTRATES THAT CALIFORNIA WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT AND EVEN CHAMPION NEW TECHNOLOGY. DEFINING BLOCKCHAIN IS A BUILDING BLOCK TO CREATING A CLEAR FRAMEWORK FOR BUSINESS IN OUR STATE WE THINK THE DEFINITION HAS THE APPROPRIATE BALANCE ALLOWING TECHNOLOGY TO A FAULT WELL PRISON GUARD RAIL AROUND WHAT IS ACCEPTABLE. KEEPING THE DEFINITION OF BLOCKCHAIN IN CODE FOR ANOTHER FIVE YEARS PROVIDE IMPORTANT REGULATORY CLARITY FOR BUSINESSES LIKE HE LAUGHED THAT OFFER TOOLS FOR FINANCIAL INCLUSION AND IN ADDITION PNEUMATIC WHICH SAFELY VERIFIED PATIENT IDENTITY AND SWEETS AND- THAT IS PILOTING BLOCKCHAIN BASED GROUNDWATER GROUNDWATER TRADING IN SOLANO COUNTY.

THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM VICE CHAIR. NOW WE WILL MOVE ON TO- WELCOME SENATOR WILL CAO SKI WHO IS GOING TO PRESENT SB FIVE THIRTY ONE FEEL FREE TO PROCEED MORE MANAGER I WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME YOU TO THE CAPITAL GOOD TO SEE YOU. MEMBERS OF. THIS IS A DISTINCTION BETWEEN A SIGNED AND THEN ASSAULTED I'D LIKE TO FIRST START OFF TO ACCEPT THE MEMBER OF THE PROPOSED COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS ARE OUTLINED IN YOUR- BILL ANALYSIS. AT ITS CORE SB FIVE THREE ONE IS THE- IT'S ABOUT BASIC RECORD KEEPING TRANSPARENCY AND PROTECTION FOR CONSUMERS THAT HAVE DEBT IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN MANY OF YOUR MEMBERS WHO WERE HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE TO TIME VOTED FOR THE FAIR DEBT. BUYING PRACTICES ACT THAT THAT MEASURE DID NOT RECEIVE A NO VOTE PASSED THROUGH BOTH HOUSES AND IT BROUGHT MUCH NEEDED REFORM TO LARGELY UNREGULATED BROKEN SYSTEM DEADLINE HERE IN THE CITY CALIFORNIA THERE WERE WIDESPREAD CASES OF COLLECTING DEBTS AGAINST THE WRONG PEOPLE TARGETING THE DEBT THAT ALREADY BEEN PAID OFF AND EFFORTS TO COLLECT THE INCORRECT AMOUNTS. SO THAT FIGURE DEADLINE PRACTICE PRACTICES ACT HELP TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES BY REQUIRING DEBT BUYERS WHO HAVE BAD DEBT SOLD TO THEM THEY HAVE PROVED THAT BUT THEIR OWNERSHIP IN IT TO ALLOW THE DEBTOR TO REQUEST THAT PROOF THAT THEY ACTUALLY HAVE THE RIGHT TO COLLECT ON THE DEBT. TOLD THE LAW ALSO REQUIRED THE DISCLOSURE THE BASIC INFORMATION MISSION SUCH AS HOW MUCH DEBT IS OWED ANY FEES OR INTEREST. AND THE DATE OF THE LAST PAYMENT. SO WITHOUT IT EVER WAS HAPPY AND THEN AND FOR. THIS BILL REPORTS FROM LEGAL SERVICES THAT DEBT COLLECTORS ARE GOING OUT OF THEIR WAY TO ASSERT THAT. THEY ARE COLLECTING ON A DEBT THAT IS A SIGN TODAY I'M NOT SOLD TO THEM. AND BECAUSE THE DEBT IS NOT BEING SOLD THE DEBTOR'S RIGHTS AND PROTECTIONS THAT ARE JUST TALK ABOUT UNDER THE FAIR DEBT BUYING. PROTECTION S. ARE BEING CIRCUMVENT SO. THE COLLECTOR'S WE'RE FINDING THAT ARE TARGETING THE WRONG DEBTORS THE COLLECTING AND INCORRECT AMOUNT ALL THE SAME HILLS AT WORK OCCURRING B- AND- THIRTEEN AND- SO THE HIGHER. THE NEED TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE THE BUREAU OF CONSUMER FINANCIAL. PROTECTION FOUND THAT FROM YEAR ATTEMPTS TO COLLECT. DEBT THE COURT DID NOT WHO WAS THE NUMBER ONE COMPLAINT IN THE CITY CALIFORNIA ROVER THREE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED ELEVEN. COMPLAINTS JUST ON THAT AND THOSE WITH THE COMPLAINTS THAT PEOPLE REPORTED THERE WERE OTHERS SO THE BILL IN FRONT OF YOU WOULD REQUIRE DEBT COLLECTORS. WHO HAVE DELINQUENT DEBTS ASSIGNED TO THEM TO HAVE TO PROVE THAT THEY HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO COLLECT ON THE DEBT. THE DEBT WOULD GIVE THE CONSUMER WHO WE REPRESENT THE RIGHT TO REQUEST STEP PROOF ALONG WITH OTHER BASIC INFORMATION REGARDING THE DEBT. AND THESE RIGHTS ARE THE SAME RIGHTS AS THOSE THAT ARTICULATED THE FAIR DEBT BUYING PRACTICES ACT. THE BILL WILL ALSO REQUIRE THE SIMPLE GOODBYE LETTER IS. SET FORTH IN THE WHEN THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE'RE TAKING IN OTHER WORDS THE ORIGINAL CREDITOR MUST NOTIFY THE CONSUMERS TO WHOM THEY WILL BE SELLING A SIGN THAT YET. AND ALONG WITH THE REMAINING BALANCES THEY SAY GOODBYE. TO THIS INSURES THE DEBTORS ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE OPEN AND BELIEVE THAT MESSAGE THAT THEY GET- RATHER THAN BE TOLD BY SOME THIRD PARTY THAT THE NEVER HEARD BEFORE IN THEIR LIFE THAT THEY OWE SOME MONEY. AND WITH ALL THE TELEPHONE SCAMS AND OTHER SUSPICIONS OF FRAUD IS JUST A GOOD CONSUMER PROTECTION SO. IT'S COMMONSENSE SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM- AND I HOPE THAT PEOPLE. IT'S A BILL THE PEOPLE NEVER HAVE TO OF. OF IN FORCE AND WITH THATI HAVE LADY FERRON. WITH THE PUBLIC LAWCENTER MADAM CHURCHES. TO FIND SUPPORT. THANK YOU SENATOR MCCAIN. WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO WITNESS TO SOME AND- SERVER PREPARED TESTIMONY WE DO HAVE A LEAF FERRON WITH THE PUBLIC LAWCENTER MODERATOR.

ONE O THE FIRST QUESTIONS WE ASK WHETHER OR NOT THE PLAINTIFFS IN MILLION WITH THE DEBT COLLECTOR. MOST IF NOT ALL OF THE TIME OUR CLIENTS THEY KNOW THEY HAVE NEVER HEARD OF THEM. DEPENDING ON THE INFORMATION PROVIDED IN THE COLLECTION LETTER OR IN THE LOT AFTER SOME INVESTIGATION HE'LL BE TAPPED IN ATTORNEYS ARE USUALLY ABLE. TO DETERMINE THE ORIGINAL CREDITOR AND IDENTIFY. THE ACCOUNT THAT THE DEBT COLLECTOR COLLECTING. BECAUSE SO MANY DONE BETTER UNDER. ABOUT ANY THAT MANY HOW. ARE STUCK NOW. THE COMPLEX NETWORK AND DEBT COLLECT IN THE I NEED ON THEIR OWN. AND MAY NEVER BE CONFIDENT THAT A DEBT COLLECTOR IT'S COLLECTING A DEBT THAT THEY ALSO. WHAT WE DO NOW. WITH OUR CLIENTS YOU KNOW WHO THEIR ORIGINAL CREDITORS ARE. THEY'RE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO RECEIVE MAIL SENT BY THE ORIGINAL CREDITOR OR OTHER MESSAGES. SB FIVE THIRTY ONE WILL REQUIRE THE ORIGINAL CREDITOR TO PROVIDE THE INFORMATION OF THE ENTITY THAT WILL BE COLLECTING THE DATA. WILL ALLOW DEBTORS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE PROCESS OF DEBT COLLECTION. AND WILL ALLOW THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO RESOLVE THEIR DEBT MUCH EARLIER IN THE PROCESS BEFORE EXCEPT. BE THAN COSTA BEEN ADDED ON. IN ADDITION WHEN I CLIENTS ARE FACING. IN ON AND THE DAY COLLECTOR TEMP ASSIGNED THE DAY I SENATOR COUNTY MY- THIS IS COMMON WITH HOSPITAL. AND BACK WHEN THE COULD.

AND TO WORK TOWARD DETERMINING APPROPRIATE SOLUTION WELL WE APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEES TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS ADOPTED IN THE ANALYSIS WE REMAIN OPPOSED TO THE- CONCERN. THANK YOUNG. THANK YOU ARE SICK WITNESS ENOUGH IS BECAUSE BURGER. THE CAL SO. OF THANK YOU MATTER CHAIR CLICK. WOULD COVER ADVOCATES IN BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COLLECTORS- WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS REGARDING THIS LEGISLATION FIRST I DO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR IN THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THE OF PROPOSED AMENDMENTS THAT WERE ADOPTED. THE NEW ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE MENTIONED IN OUR WIDER SO WHILE WE APPRECIATE THAT BUT WE DO WANT TO POINT OUT TO THE COMMITTEE. THAT SB FIVE THREE ONE EXPAND EXISTING. FOR DEBT BUYERS TO DEBT COLLECTORS SB TWO THREE THREE ONE OH TWO THOUSAND AND THIRTEEN WAS THE RESULT OF MORE THAN TWO YEARS OF NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN CENTER WHAT ARE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COLLECTORS DEBT BUYERS AND CONSUMER GROUPS. IT APPLIES SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS THE ENTITIES THAT PURCHASED GAS DEBT BUYERS PURCHASED DEBT PORTFOLIOS FROM ORIGINAL CREDITORS AS AN INVESTMENT THE REQUIREMENTS OF SB TWO THREE THREE WERE CRAFTED TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES INVOLVED IN COLLECTING. PURCHASE DEBTS OVER LONGER PERIODS OF TIME BETWEEN A BUYER AND A DEBTOR THEY HAVE NO DIRECT RELATIONSHIP DEBT COLLECTORS ARE ASSIGNEES PRIMARILY REPRESENTING ORIGINAL CREDITORS AND ARE ATTEMPTING TO COLLECT A DEBT THAT HAS NOT BEEN CHARGED OFF OR IS OBSOLETE. CERTAIN PROVISONS S. B. FIVE THREE ONE WARRING CONFLICT WITH FEDERAL LAW AND SHOULD NOT. DO NOT APPLY TO DEBT COLLECTORS BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT PARTICULARLY WORKABLE THERE ARE TWO ISSUES THAT I WANT TO DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO AT THIS TIME ONE RELATES TO THE FACT THAT THE LENO BILL WHEN IT WAS ENACTED PER THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS CONTAIN LANGUAGE. THAT EXPRESSLY STATED THAT IT APPLIED PROSPECTIVELY WE'VE ASKED FOR THE INCLUSION OF THAT SAME LANGUAGE IN THIS BILL AND IF THIS BILL IMPORT THE PROVISIONS SUBSTANTIVE REASONS OF ALL I KNOW BILL. FAILURE TO INCLUDE THE LANGUAGE THAT MADE IT CLEAR THAT THE PROVISIONS APPLY PROSPECTIVELY. POTENTIALLY CREATE HIS. IN WHICH- ONE ARGUE THIS BILL INVALIDATES EXISTING CONSUMER ACCOUNTS IN DEATHS AND CREATES A CONSTITUTIONAL TAKING ISSUE WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THAT IS NOT THE INTENT OF THE BILL. BUT WE DO NOT SEE WHY IF THAT IS THE CASE THAT LANGUAGES NOT INCLUDED THAT WE IN SENATOR WHEN I WAS BILL. WE DO NOT THINK IT IS APPROPRIATE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO PASS A BILL THAT LEAVES THAT POINT CONFUSED AND EXPOSES THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY TO POTENTIALLY MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN LITIGATION. UNNECESSARILY OVER WHETHER THIS BILL IS PROSPECTIVE OR RETROACTIVE. SECONDARILY VERY SPECIFICALLY THIS BILL IMPORTANT LANGUAGE THAT WAS IN THE ONE OH BILL THEIR REQUIRES DISCLOSURE OF WHAT WE CALL CHAIN OF TITLE CHAIN OF TITLE IS A CONCEPT THAT. BELONGS WITH DEBT BUYERS BECAUSE THEY BUY AND SELL. CONSUMER DATA THERE IS NO CHAIN OF TITLE ISSUE OR- APPROPRIATE.

CENTER GROVE AREA THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- I I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS TO SEE IF I CAN GET THEM GET THROUGH THEM BECAUSE IT'S A PRETTY TECHNICAL AREA AND I I AM I'M I'M CONCERNED ABOUT SOME OF THE LANGUAGE ISSUES THAT PROBABLY SHOULD BE WORKED OUT BY BY NOW BECAUSE THIS IS THE BANKING COMMITTEE BUT -- BUT I THINK THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MR -- SENATOR BREAK HUSKY TO TO WORK WITH THE -- THE DIFFERENT ENTITIES THAT HAVE SOME CONCERN I WAS CONTACTED BY A FRIEND OF MINE WHO'S A LONG TIME -- -- HAS BEEN IN BUSINESS FOR THIRTY FORTY YEARS OF THE SOME OF THE CONCERNS CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED WERE OPERATED BY HIM AS WELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN IT A DEBT COLLECTOR AND A DEBT BUYER IS FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT AND SO I'M WONDERING IF -- I COULD HAVE MISTER WHITE CASKETS PLAN A LITTLE BIT -- WHAT ATTEMPTS HE'S MADE TO TO WORK WITH -- THE DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS AND OF THE RETROACTIVITY -- I'M NOT SURE I UNDERSTOOD EXACTLY WHAT WAS THE RIGHT WAY TO GO IF YOU DO IT THEN IT'S A TAKING IF YOU DON'T DO IT THEN WE DON'T LIKE IT SO -- I GUESS THAT'S THE FIRST QUESTION I HAVE FROM FOR THE SENATOR THANK YOU CENTER GOVERNOR CENTER WITH HOUSE YOU WOULD YOU LIKE TO RESPOND TO THIS THANK YOU MANAGER AND I WILL I HAVE BEEN LONG TIME FRIENDS WITH THE BANKING COMMUNITY THE CREDIT CAN CREDIT UNIONS THE TECH COLLECTORS THE DEBT BUYERS -- THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ON A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT BILL SO THOSE AVENUES ARE STILL OPEN WE WILL CONTINUE TO TALK WITH THEM AT THE AT THE BOTTOM THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT YOU KNOW THE CONSTITUTION THE STATE CALIFORNIA SAYS THAT WE PASS A BILL IT BECOMES EFFECTIVE ON THE BEGINNING OF THE NEXT YEAR UNLESS WE DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT THE SWISS PICK ANOTHER DATE IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT LET'S COUNCIL HAS SPECIFICALLY ADVISED US AGAINST INCLUDING A SPORTS PERSPECTIVE DAY STATING THAT IT SETS A BAD PRECEDENT AND CAN CONFUSE THE COURTS THE PHARMACY THAT SHOULD ONLY BE USED IN CASES WHERE YOU WANT TO EXTEND IT SO THEY'VE ASKED THAT WE NOT PUT IN A BILL BECAUSE THE CORPORATE OR A DAY THE QUESTION IS IS THE ACTIVITY THAT WOULD HAPPEN IS WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO SAY IS THAT IN TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY TWENTY THREE WE WANT THE CONSUMER TO HAVE SOME IDEA OF WHO YOU'RE DEALING WITH AND RIGHT NOW THIS PRACTICES ALLOWED WE DON'T WE WANT TO CHANGE THAT PRACTICE DOING GOING FORWARD THAT'S ON ADVICE OF COUNSEL WE DON'T HAVE IT THANK YOU CENTER COMING OUT OF WOULD YOU LIKE TO FOLLOW UP AND I DO APPRECIATE THAT THE CLARIFICATION -- AND LET ME JUST SAY THAT I'M GONNA SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY AND I I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT THE DEBTORS UNDERSTAND WHO IT IS IT'S COLLECTING ON IT'S BECOME INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO KNOW WHETHER IT'S A SCAM OR WHETHER IT'S SOMEBODY TRYING TO COLLECT A DEBT THAT YOU HAVE NO IDEA YOU KNOW OR THEY MAY BE IN YOUR NAME THAT'S NOT YOURS OR DAD THEY HAVE A SIMILAR NAME TWO YEARS AND THEY'RE JUST THEY'RE JUST SCOUTING TO SEE IF ANYBODY WILL PAY IT I'M AND I'VE HAD ALL OF THAT HAPPENED TO ME AND SO I I'M I I DO UNDERSTAND HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS IT THIS IS BACK -- IN REGARDS TO THAT THE FEDERAL ACTION IS BEING TAKEN MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE FEDERAL IS A BOTTOM BASELINE WE CAN ADD IT DOESN'T PREEMPT THE STATE FROM ADDING MORE -- REGULATORY OVERSIGHT AND SO I'M WONDERING IF IF -- IF THE SENATOR COULD TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL UNDERSTANDING THAT IT IS A BOTTOM AND HOW THIS WOULD WORK IN WITH WITH THE BILL GIVEN THAT WE'RE TAKING ACTION AND INDIA THE REQUESTED THAT WE NOT TAKE ANY ACTION AND I THINK WE SHOULD BUT I'D LIKE TO HEAR WITH THE CENTER HAS TO SAY THANK YOU SENATOR HAVE IT A POINT WELL TAKEN AND SENATOR BECAUSE HE WOULD LIKE TO RETURN THEM TO THE SENATOR FROM SALINAS IS EXACTLY CORRECT THIS IS IT AND IT'S NOT CERTAIN THAT THE FEDERAL REGULATIONS THAT COULD IMPEDE ADOPTED THIS IS THIS IS A DISCUSSION IS GOING ON THERE'S NOTHING THAT'S CONTAINED IN SB FIVE AT THREE ONE THE CONFLICTS WITH THE FEDERAL REGULATIONS AND YEAH IT'S THE FLORIDA IT'S THE BARE MINIMUM OF FRIGHTS AND WE BELIEVE THE CALIFORNIANS SHOULD BE A LOT MORE PROTECTION AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL SEEKS TO THEIR THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS MEMBERS WE DO HAVE A MOTION SO -- WE WILL GO AHEAD AND HAVE THE CENTER -- KELSEY CLOSED IF YOU WOULD LIKE I WILL CONTINUE TO TALK WITH THE OPPOSITION I UNDERSTAND THAT SOME OF THE OBJECTIONS ARE WITH THE LANGUAGE AND WE'RE ACCEPTING THAT THE COMMITTEES PUT IN SO I'VE ACCEPTED THAT THOSE AMENDMENTS -- AND OBVIOUSLY AT THE BOTTOM LINE WE THINK THAT CALIFORNIA'S JUST DESERVE SOME NOTICE OF OF WHETHER THEY HAVE BEEN CONTACTED BY SOMEBODY IT'S IMPROVED THEY ACTUALLY HAVE THE RIGHT TO COLLECT ON THE DEBT AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE GIVING UP THEIR MONEY TO THE RIGHT ENTITY AND I WOULD URGE AND I FELT
