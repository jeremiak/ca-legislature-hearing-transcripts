THIS TO PERHAPS SHARE A FEW

00:31:16.641 --> 00:31:20.078 region:rollup2
THOUGHTS I PERSONALLY HAVE HAD

00:31:18.677 --> 00:31:22.447 region:rollup2
THAT EXPERIENCE IS A CANCER

00:31:20.078 --> 00:31:23.949 region:rollup2
SURVIVOR I WAS TAKING ALL SORTS

00:31:22.447 --> 00:31:25.550 region:rollup2
OF MEDICATIONS OR AT LEAST THEY

00:31:23.949 --> 00:31:26.184 region:rollup2
WERE PRESCRIBED TO ME FOR

00:31:25.550 --> 00:31:27.652 region:rollup2
WHATEVER THIS.

00:31:26.184 --> 00:31:29.054 region:rollup2
WAS THAT I WAS DOING OF THAT WAS

00:31:27.652 --> 00:31:31.223 region:rollup2
THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO DO.

00:31:29.054 --> 00:31:32.424 region:rollup2
AT THE END OF THE DAY THANKFULLY

00:31:31.223 --> 00:31:33.391 region:rollup2
IT WAS AWHILE AGO A LONG TIME

00:31:32.424 --> 00:31:34.893 region:rollup2
AGO.

00:31:33.391 --> 00:31:37.162 region:rollup2
I LOOKED AT MY MEDICINE CABINET

00:31:34.893 --> 00:31:38.330 region:rollup2
I HAD NO.

00:31:37.162 --> 00:31:40.699 region:rollup2
WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO HAVE

00:31:38.330 --> 00:31:42.100 region:rollup2
TAKEN THEM FOR AND THE QUESTION

00:31:40.699 --> 00:31:43.668 region:rollup2
WAS NOW WITH TWO I DO WITH THEM?

00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:46.037 region:rollup2
AND THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT I

00:31:43.668 --> 00:31:47.572 region:rollup2
THINK MOST OF US HAVE EITHER FOR

00:31:46.037 --> 00:31:50.442 region:rollup2
OURSELVES OR FOOD CARED FOR OUR

00:31:47.572 --> 00:31:52.711 region:rollup2
PARENTS OR ELDAR ELDERLY.

00:31:50.442 --> 00:31:54.679 region:rollup2
THERE'S JUST WHICH WE HAVE NOT

00:31:52.711 --> 00:31:56.848 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZED THE NEED TO OR THE A

00:31:54.679 --> 00:31:58.950 region:rollup2
THAT WHAT IS REQUIRED TO REMOVE

00:31:56.848 --> 00:32:00.852 region:rollup2
REMOVE FEES OF MEDICATIONS AND

00:31:58.950 --> 00:32:04.156 region:rollup2
DANGEROUS PRODUCTS --

00:32:00.852 --> 00:32:05.424 region:rollup2
FROM OUR HOME SO --

00:32:04.156 --> 00:32:07.659 region:rollup2
YEAH I HAVE WORKED ON THIS --

00:32:05.424 --> 00:32:09.594 region:rollup2
AS I MENTIONED FOR MANY YEARS AS

00:32:07.659 --> 00:32:10.629 region:rollup2
A RESULT OF MY OWN EXPERIENCE

00:32:09.594 --> 00:32:12.030 region:rollup2
AND JUST RECOGNIZING THE

00:32:10.629 --> 00:32:14.266 region:rollup2
IMPORTANCE OF THIS.

00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:16.001 region:rollup2
WHEN THESE ARE ITEMS ARE NOT

00:32:14.266 --> 00:32:18.170 region:rollup2
DISPOSED OF SAFELY?

00:32:16.001 --> 00:32:20.138 region:rollup2
THE WASTE IS SUBJECT TO ABUSE WE

00:32:18.170 --> 00:32:22.174 region:rollup2
HAVE A LOT OF SUPPORT FROM OUR

00:32:20.138 --> 00:32:23.875 region:rollup2
WATER COME DISTRICTS BECAUSE

00:32:22.174 --> 00:32:25.377 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WILL DUMP THESE DOWN THE

00:32:23.875 --> 00:32:26.878 region:rollup2
TOILET THEY INFEST OUR WATER

00:32:25.377 --> 00:32:28.613 region:rollup2

NECESSARILY --

00:32:30.582 --> 00:32:34.853 region:rollup2
DISINTEGRATE SO THE HARM TO

00:32:32.717 --> 00:32:36.488 region:rollup2
SOCIETY IS NOT JUST THE PERSONAL

00:32:34.853 --> 00:32:38.290 region:rollup2

AMENDED ON THE BILL AND WE HAVE

00:52:05.089 --> 00:52:07.624 region:rollup2
A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THINGS

00:52:06.056 --> 00:52:09.360 region:rollup2
THAT WE FEEL THE BILL NEED TO BE

00:52:07.624 --> 00:52:09.760 region:rollup2
CLARIFIED WITH A LITTLE BIT MORE

00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:11.629 region:rollup2
CLEAR DIRECTION.

00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:12.763 region:rollup2
ON HOW THE BILL BE IMPLEMENTED

00:52:11.629 --> 00:52:14.631 region:rollup2
AND ENFORCED.

00:52:12.763 --> 00:52:15.833 region:rollup2
JUST A FEW QUICK EXAMPLES OF

00:52:14.631 --> 00:52:17.167 region:rollup2
WHAT THOSE COULD BE --

00:52:15.833 --> 00:52:21.405 region:rollup2
THERE ARE CERTAIN --

00:52:17.167 --> 00:52:22.906 region:rollup2
THRESHOLDS AND HOW AND THERE

00:52:21.405 --> 00:52:24.274 region:rollup2
WOULD BE COLLECTION SITES AND

00:52:22.906 --> 00:52:25.943 region:rollup2
TAKE BACK PROGRAMS AND

00:52:24.274 --> 00:52:27.411 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS --

00:52:25.943 --> 00:52:28.412 region:rollup2
FOR HOW PHARMACIES PARTICIPATE

00:52:27.411 --> 00:52:31.115 region:rollup2
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S

00:52:28.412 --> 00:52:32.416 region:rollup2
CLEAR AND IT'S CLEARLY ENFORCED

00:52:31.115 --> 00:52:33.517 region:rollup2

00:52:32.416 --> 00:52:35.219 region:rollup2
THRESHOLD AND IF YOU'RE IN

ALPINE COUNTY THAT'S VERY MUCH

00:52:35.219 --> 00:52:38.122 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT THAN IT IS LA COUNTY.

00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:39.223 region:rollup2
AND SO THERE'S A LOT OF CONCERNS

00:52:38.122 --> 00:52:40.324 region:rollup2
AND QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN RAISED

00:52:39.223 --> 00:52:41.325 region:rollup2

SURE THAT THEY HAVE THOSE

00:52:43.894 --> 00:52:46.430 region:rollup2
ADDRESSED --

00:52:44.762 --> 00:52:48.666 region:rollup2
IN THE BILL AND LASTLY AND WITH

00:52:46.430 --> 00:52:49.600 region:rollup2
RESPECT TO SHARPS --

00:52:48.666 --> 00:52:51.301 region:rollup2
SHARPE SERVED VERY DIFFERENT

00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:53.737 region:rollup2
DISPOSAL.

00:52:51.301 --> 00:52:55.439 region:rollup2
SYSTEM THAN A DRAW THAN DRUGS --

00:52:53.737 --> 00:52:58.342 region:rollup2
PHARMACIES HAVE NOT BEEN AT THE

00:52:55.439 --> 00:52:59.643 region:rollup2
FOREFRONT OF DISPOSAL OF SHARPS

00:52:58.342 --> 00:53:02.146 region:rollup2
AND THERE ARE MANY PHARMACIES

00:52:59.643 --> 00:53:02.946 region:rollup2
THAT ACTUALLY ACTIVELY

00:53:02.146 --> 00:53:05.215 region:rollup2
VOLUNTARILY PARTICIPATE IN --

00:53:02.946 --> 00:53:07.084 region:rollup2

AT LEAST FOR COLLECTION SITES

00:53:12.122 --> 00:53:15.359 region:rollup2
AND SO WE WOULD REALLY WANT TO

00:53:14.191 --> 00:53:17.027 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S SOME

00:53:15.359 --> 00:53:19.563 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC DISCUSSION ABOUT SHARKS

00:53:17.027 --> 00:53:20.364 region:rollup2

01:11:30.286 --> 01:11:33.122 region:rollup2
GOING TO HELP THE A SHARPS

01:11:31.287 --> 01:11:34.624 region:rollup2

VERY SPECIFIC PROBLEM.

01:11:45.234 --> 01:11:47.670 region:rollup2
THAT'S ACTUALLY ONE OF THE

01:11:45.802 --> 01:11:48.671 region:rollup2
REASONS WHY I GOT INVOLVED IN

01:11:47.670 --> 01:11:52.575 region:rollup2
THIS ISSUE ON THE SHARP SIDE.

01:11:48.671 --> 01:11:55.111 region:rollup2
ARM. ONE THING AND AS I BELIEVE.

01:11:52.575 --> 01:11:57.113 region:rollup2
MISTER MISS MISTER KALRA TALKED

01:11:55.111 --> 01:11:57.680 region:rollup2
ABOUT IS JUST MAKING EVERYTHING

01:11:57.113 --> 01:11:58.748 region:rollup2
MORE CONVENIENT AND THAT'S

01:11:57.680 --> 01:12:00.149 region:rollup2
REALLY.

01:11:58.748 --> 01:12:02.652 region:rollup2
WHY WE'RE TRYING TO ESTABLISH%

01:12:00.149 --> 01:12:05.054 region:rollup2
SORT OF ZONES AND AREAS WHERE?

01:12:02.652 --> 01:12:06.789 region:rollup2
CAN KNOW WHERE TO DISPOSE OF

01:12:05.054 --> 01:12:08.124 region:rollup2
THAT'S I THINK THE HOPE IS THAT

01:12:06.789 --> 01:12:09.425 region:rollup2
ONCE PEOPLE KNOW WHERE THEY CAN

01:12:08.124 --> 01:12:11.561 region:rollup2
GO THEY WILL DO IT.

01:12:09.425 --> 01:12:12.762 region:rollup2
NOW AGAIN YOU HAVE SOME FOLKS

01:12:11.561 --> 01:12:16.132 region:rollup2
WHO HAVE.

01:12:12.762 --> 01:12:17.433 region:rollup2
I TIMES VERY SERIOUS ISSUES SO

01:12:16.132 --> 01:12:18.734 region:rollup2
THING THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE UP

01:12:17.433 --> 01:12:19.936 region:rollup2
HUMPED TEMPERATURES PATIENT BUT

01:12:18.734 --> 01:12:21.737 region:rollup2
THE HOPE IS THAT THE MORE

01:12:28.211 --> 01:12:31.214 region:rollup2
POLICY THAT ADDRESSES MORE THE

01:12:29.445 --> 01:12:32.815 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDER CONCERNS WE'VE HEARD

01:12:31.214 --> 01:12:34.884 region:rollup2

01:12:53.903 --> 01:12:57.340 region:rollup2
THINKING THE AUTHORS FOR

01:12:54.604 --> 01:12:59.242 region:rollup2
BRINGING THIS TO A NECESSARY --

01:12:57.340 --> 01:13:01.077 region:rollup2
BILL FORWARD IT'S IMPORTANT FOR

01:12:59.242 --> 01:13:03.246 region:rollup2
US TO ADDRESS THIS CRISIS HAD ON

01:13:01.077 --> 01:13:04.614 region:rollup2
I AM GONNA.

01:13:03.246 --> 01:13:05.848 region:rollup2
TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT PROCESS

01:13:04.614 --> 01:13:09.919 region:rollup2
THOUGH AND I HAVE A LITTLE BIT

01:13:05.848 --> 01:13:10.620 region:rollup2
OF DOT CONCERNS BASED ON WHAT

01:13:09.919 --> 01:13:12.622 region:rollup2
WE'RE HEARING FROM ALL THE

01:13:10.620 --> 01:13:14.090 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDERS TODAY I'M WILLING

01:13:12.622 --> 01:13:15.591 region:rollup2
TO ALLOW THIS TO GO FORWARD.

01:13:14.090 --> 01:13:17.126 region:rollup2
BUT WANTS TO MAKE SURE THE

01:13:15.591 --> 01:13:18.694 region:rollup2
VOICES OF OUR AD COMMUNITY IN

01:13:17.126 --> 01:13:20.596 region:rollup2
RURAL COMMUNITIES ARE HURT.

01:13:18.694 --> 01:13:22.231 region:rollup2
THAT THIS ONE SIZE FITS ALL

01:13:20.596 --> 01:13:25.268 region:rollup2
POLICY DOES NOT.

01:13:22.231 --> 01:13:27.003 region:rollup2
OVERLY HURT AN INDUSTRY THAT'S

01:13:25.268 --> 01:13:28.804 region:rollup2
THIS CITY HAS NOT ALWAYS BEEN TO

01:13:27.003 --> 01:13:30.373 region:rollup2
KIND TWO AND SO WOULD WANT TO

01:13:28.804 --> 01:13:31.274 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT ANY POLICIES WE

01:13:30.373 --> 01:13:33.109 region:rollup2
PUSH OUT.

01:13:31.274 --> 01:13:35.478 region:rollup2
ARE RECOGNIZING THAT AND TAKING

01:13:33.109 --> 01:13:37.346 region:rollup2
CARE OF OUR AG COMMUNITIES.

01:13:35.478 --> 01:13:38.481 region:rollup2
I'M SPECIFICALLY LOOKING AT BOTH

01:13:37.346 --> 01:13:39.048 region:rollup2
THE MEDICATED FEED ON THE

01:13:38.481 --> 01:13:41.417 region:rollup2
VETERINARY MEDICINE PORTIONS

01:13:39.048 --> 01:13:44.186 region:rollup2
THIS.

01:13:41.417 --> 01:13:47.189 region:rollup2
SECONDARILY I UNDERSTAND THE

01:13:44.186 --> 01:13:51.294 region:rollup2
LOGIC BETWEEN TRYING --

01:13:47.189 --> 01:13:54.931 region:rollup2
TO COMBINING STATEWIDE POLL --

01:13:51.294 --> 01:13:57.133 region:rollup2
BUT THEY'RE NOT UBIQUITOUS AND

01:13:54.931 --> 01:13:58.901 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE CONCERNS I HAVE ARE

01:13:57.133 --> 01:14:00.269 region:rollup2
STEMMING FROM WHAT OCCURS WITHIN

01:13:58.901 --> 01:14:02.638 region:rollup2
A HOSPITAL SO I'D.

01:14:00.269 --> 01:14:04.307 region:rollup2
LIKE SOME UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT

01:14:02.638 --> 01:14:05.941 region:rollup2
HAPPENS IN MORE CLINIC SETTINGS

01:14:04.307 --> 01:14:08.044 region:rollup2
WHAT HAPPENS IN MORE RURAL

01:14:05.941 --> 01:14:09.512 region:rollup2
SETTINGS HOW DOES THIS ACTUALLY

01:14:08.044 --> 01:14:11.881 region:rollup2
GET IMPLEMENTED AND SO --

01:14:09.512 --> 01:14:13.449 region:rollup2
THERE MAY BE A PLENTY OF TIME

01:14:11.881 --> 01:14:14.850 region:rollup2
FOR US TO DISCUSS WITH THIS BUT

01:14:13.449 --> 01:14:16.052 region:rollup2
IN LIGHT OF THE PROCESS THAT I

01:14:14.850 --> 01:14:17.186 region:rollup2
STARTED WITH THIS I'D LIKE AN

01:14:16.052 --> 01:14:18.554 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY.

01:14:17.186 --> 01:14:19.989 region:rollup2
TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH THE

01:14:18.554 --> 01:14:21.357 region:rollup2
AUTHORS TO BE ABLE TO BETTER

01:14:19.989 --> 01:14:23.292 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THIS BILL.

01:14:21.357 --> 01:14:24.927 region:rollup2
AND MAKE SURE THIS IS THE BEST

01:14:23.292 --> 01:14:26.896 region:rollup2
POLICY THAT WE CAN PUSH FORWARD.

01:14:24.927 --> 01:14:29.332 region:rollup2
BOMB YOU KNOW THE ENEMY A

01:14:26.896 --> 01:14:33.769 region:rollup2
PERFECT SHOULD NOT BE GOOD AND I

01:14:29.332 --> 01:14:34.737 region:rollup2
DON'T INTEND TO STOP THIS IN ITS

01:14:33.769 --> 01:14:36.005 region:rollup2
TRACKS BUT WANT US TO MAKE SURE

01:14:34.737 --> 01:14:36.539 region:rollup2
THAT WE ARE PUT IT.

01:14:36.005 --> 01:14:38.541 region:rollup2
BEST POLICY FORWARD AND I

01:14:36.539 --> 01:14:39.475 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THAT'S TAKING AND WHAT

01:14:38.541 --> 01:14:41.644 region:rollup2
WE'RE HEARING FROM STAKEHOLDERS

01:14:39.475 --> 01:14:43.179 region:rollup2
AND I IMPROVING UPON THIS AND

01:14:41.644 --> 01:14:44.513 region:rollup2
HOPE THAT'S WHAT COMES BACK IN

01:14:43.179 --> 01:14:46.215 region:rollup2
AUGUST --

01:14:44.513 --> 01:14:47.984 region:rollup2
BUT THERE ARE CONCERNS OF BOTH

01:14:46.215 --> 01:14:49.985 region:rollup2
FROM THOSE OF US WHO ARE GOING

01:14:47.984 --> 01:14:50.820 region:rollup2
TO SUPPORT IT TODAY A WHO WANTS

01:14:49.985 --> 01:14:53.289 region:rollup2
TO MAKE SURE THIS IS A BETTER

01:14:50.820 --> 01:14:53.589 region:rollup2
PRODUCT GOING FORWARD

01:14:53.289 --> 01:14:56.058 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

01:14:53.589 --> 01:14:57.693 region:rollup2
TOTALLY AGREE.

01:14:56.058 --> 01:15:00.096 region:rollup2
ALRIGHT ARE PERHAPS YOU WOULD.

01:14:57.693 --> 01:15:02.264 region:rollup2
LIKE DID THE AUTHORS THEN --

01:15:00.096 --> 01:15:03.466 region:rollup2
COULD DE BRIEFLY I KNOW YOU HAVE

01:15:02.264 --> 01:15:05.701 region:rollup2

01:15:03.466 --> 01:15:08.838 region:rollup2
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE AND YOU HAVE

01:15:05.701 --> 01:15:10.406 region:rollup2

THREE SO I KNOW YOU'D LIKE TO

01:15:10.406 --> 01:15:13.309 region:rollup2
GET THAT OFF SO.

01:15:11.674 --> 01:15:15.244 region:rollup2
APPROACH YOU COULD DO THE THREE

01:15:13.309 --> 01:15:15.811 region:rollup2
OF YOU COULD CLOSE QUICKLY AND

01:15:15.244 --> 01:15:17.947 region:rollup2
THAT WILL GET ON TO THE NEXT

01:15:15.811 --> 01:15:19.715 region:rollup2
MATTER --

01:15:17.947 --> 01:15:20.649 region:rollup2
THANK YOU AN AND DOES THIS THIS

01:15:19.715 --> 01:15:22.118 region:rollup2
IS AN IMPORTANT MEASURE WE'VE

01:15:20.649 --> 01:15:24.086 region:rollup2
BEEN TRYING TO GET.

01:15:22.118 --> 01:15:25.554 region:rollup2
SOMETHING GOING FOR QUITE SOME

01:15:24.086 --> 01:15:27.990 region:rollup2
TIME I WON'T REFERRED WOOD IS

01:15:25.554 --> 01:15:28.924 region:rollup2
SORT OF A FORM OF RELUCTANCE ON

01:15:27.990 --> 01:15:30.659 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY'S PART.

01:15:28.924 --> 01:15:32.495 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY'S AT THE TABLE NOW

01:15:30.659 --> 01:15:33.963 region:rollup2
THAT HAS BEEN THE BIGGEST

01:15:32.495 --> 01:15:35.498 region:rollup2
CHALLENGE WE'VE HAD IS TO GET

01:15:33.963 --> 01:15:36.665 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY TO SIT DOWN AND TALK

01:15:35.498 --> 01:15:38.401 region:rollup2
ABOUT THIS.

01:15:36.665 --> 01:15:39.502 region:rollup2
THERE THERE THIS DIDN'T HAPPEN

01:15:38.401 --> 01:15:42.238 region:rollup2
OVERNIGHT IT.

01:15:39.502 --> 01:15:44.874 region:rollup2
HAPPEN FRANKLY SORT RECENTLY AND

01:15:42.238 --> 01:15:46.776 region:rollup2
AS A RESULT OF THERE ARE LOTS OF

01:15:44.874 --> 01:15:48.010 region:rollup2
VERY GOOD POINTS AND I THINK AN

01:15:46.776 --> 01:15:49.145 region:rollup2
OPEN AND HONEST AND FRANK

01:15:48.010 --> 01:15:51.147 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION.

01:15:49.145 --> 01:15:52.748 region:rollup2
IS WHAT WE FINALLY ARE GETTING

01:15:51.147 --> 01:15:54.116 region:rollup2
AND I THINK WE'RE ALL COMMITTED

01:15:52.748 --> 01:15:54.650 region:rollup2
TO RESPONDING --

01:15:54.116 --> 01:15:58.554 region:rollup2
AND TRYING TO ADDRESS THE

01:15:54.650 --> 01:16:00.689 region:rollup2
CONCERNS RAISED AND BY ALLOWING

01:15:58.554 --> 01:16:01.724 region:rollup2
US TO CONTINUE IN THIS PROCESS I

01:16:00.689 --> 01:16:04.527 region:rollup2
THINK WE ARE.

01:16:01.724 --> 01:16:06.562 region:rollup2
A BY OPENING THAT DOOR.

01:16:04.527 --> 01:16:07.863 region:rollup2
OUR BUDDY 80% OF THE WAY THERE

01:16:06.562 --> 01:16:09.131 region:rollup2
IT WAS JUST GETTING THAT DOOR

01:16:07.863 --> 01:16:10.800 region:rollup2
OPEN THAT'S BEEN REALLY THE

01:16:09.131 --> 01:16:12.435 region:rollup2
CHALLENGE AND I'M CONFIDENT THAT

01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:13.869 region:rollup2
WITH ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS THERE

01:16:12.435 --> 01:16:15.871 region:rollup2
WE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE --

01:16:13.869 --> 01:16:18.307 region:rollup2
TO COME TO A A GOOD RESOLUTION

01:16:15.871 --> 01:16:18.741 region:rollup2
AND TO WITH THAT I WOULD SIMPLY

01:16:18.307 --> 01:16:20.342 region:rollup2
ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE.

01:16:18.741 --> 01:16:21.644 region:rollup2
OKAY.

01:16:20.342 --> 01:16:23.412 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I REMEMBER TENGAN GRAY

01:16:21.644 --> 01:16:26.215 region:rollup2
OKAY -- SO

01:16:23.412 --> 01:16:27.583 region:rollup2
LET ME -- I

01:16:26.215 --> 01:16:29.051 region:rollup2
THINK I HEARD FROM SEVERAL

01:16:27.583 --> 01:16:30.853 region:rollup2
MEMBERS THAT THERE SHOULD BE A

01:16:29.051 --> 01:16:32.021 region:rollup2
STATEWIDE PROGRAM.

01:16:30.853 --> 01:16:33.456 region:rollup2
NOW I THINK IT SHOULD ONLY BE A

01:16:32.021 --> 01:16:34.457 region:rollup2
STATE WIDE PROGRAM IF IT'S

01:16:33.456 --> 01:16:36.826 region:rollup2
BETTER THAN ALL THE LOCAL

01:16:34.457 --> 01:16:38.060 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS.

01:16:36.826 --> 01:16:39.728 region:rollup2
I THINK IF WE CAN DO THAT THEN

01:16:38.060 --> 01:16:41.063 region:rollup2
WE CAN BRING PEOPLE ALONG TO

01:16:39.728 --> 01:16:43.866 region:rollup2
MAKE IT A STATE WIDE PROGRAM BUT

01:16:41.063 --> 01:16:44.767 region:rollup2
IT REALLY HAS TO BE BETTER --

01:16:43.866 --> 01:16:46.435 region:rollup2
I CAN TELL YOU RIGHT NOW THE

01:16:44.767 --> 01:16:48.871 region:rollup2
ALAMEDA COUNTY PROGRAM THE FIRST

01:16:46.435 --> 01:16:50.105 region:rollup2
ONE IN THE STATE --

01:16:48.871 --> 01:16:52.541 region:rollup2
I FOLLOWED IT WHEN IT WAS

01:16:50.105 --> 01:16:53.943 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION I FOLLOWED IT IN THE

01:16:52.541 --> 01:16:55.044 region:rollup2
COURT CASE BUT THEN I NEVER

01:16:53.943 --> 01:16:56.846 region:rollup2
HEARD ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THEY

01:16:55.044 --> 01:16:59.014 region:rollup2
HAVE A PROGRAM.

01:16:56.846 --> 01:17:00.349 region:rollup2
NOBODY IN HAYWARD KNOWS THE

01:16:59.014 --> 01:17:02.084 region:rollup2
COLLECTION SITES ARE IN OBSCURE

01:17:00.349 --> 01:17:05.154 region:rollup2
PLACES THIS FORTY ONE THE COUNTY

01:17:02.084 --> 01:17:06.055 region:rollup2
BUT THERE TYPICALLY AT VERY

01:17:05.154 --> 01:17:06.655 region:rollup2
SMALL.

01:17:06.055 --> 01:17:09.625 region:rollup2
SORT OF MOM AND POP PHARMACIES

01:17:06.655 --> 01:17:11.827 region:rollup2
--

01:17:09.625 --> 01:17:13.562 region:rollup2
THAT OCCASIONALLY --

01:17:11.827 --> 01:17:14.897 region:rollup2
KAISER AS TAKEN ABACK WHICH IS A

01:17:13.562 --> 01:17:17.066 region:rollup2
MAJOR THING BECAUSE HALF THE

01:17:14.897 --> 01:17:18.634 region:rollup2
PEOPLE PROBABLY TO USE KAISER.

01:17:17.066 --> 01:17:20.169 region:rollup2
BUT FOR ANYONE WHO ISN'T USING

01:17:18.634 --> 01:17:21.337 region:rollup2
KAISER.

01:17:20.169 --> 01:17:23.272 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE

01:17:21.337 --> 01:17:25.708 region:rollup2
PROGRAM --

01:17:23.272 --> 01:17:26.909 region:rollup2
IN MY OPINION WE SHOULD HAVE

01:17:25.708 --> 01:17:29.278 region:rollup2
EVERY PHARMACY VIEW PART OF DRUG

01:17:26.909 --> 01:17:31.013 region:rollup2
TAKE BACK.

01:17:29.278 --> 01:17:32.815 region:rollup2
SHARP SHOULD CLEARLY DIFFERENT I

01:17:31.013 --> 01:17:35.684 region:rollup2
DON'T THINK THE SHARPS PART OF

01:17:32.815 --> 01:17:37.219 region:rollup2
THIS PROGRAM IS MATURE YET.

01:17:35.684 --> 01:17:39.889 region:rollup2
IT IS HARD TO GET BILLS OFF THE

01:17:37.219 --> 01:17:42.691 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLY FLOOR AND IF THE SHARPS

01:17:39.889 --> 01:17:44.660 region:rollup2
PART IS NOT BETTER IT IT RISKS.

01:17:42.691 --> 01:17:45.928 region:rollup2
BRINGING DOWN THE WHOLE BILL SO

01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:47.963 region:rollup2
YOU MAY WANT TO THINK ABOUT

01:17:45.928 --> 01:17:50.132 region:rollup2
MAKING THE SHARPS PART SEPARATE

01:17:47.963 --> 01:17:51.867 region:rollup2
IN NEGOTIATING THAT SEPARATE.

01:17:50.132 --> 01:17:53.736 region:rollup2
ARE BUT I THINK THE DRUGS PART

01:17:51.867 --> 01:17:54.737 region:rollup2
IF WE CAN MAKE IT EFFECTIVE AND

01:17:53.736 --> 01:17:56.005 region:rollup2
AGAIN I HEARD THAT FROM A NUMBER

01:17:54.737 --> 01:17:58.107 region:rollup2
OF PEOPLE.

01:17:56.005 --> 01:18:00.409 region:rollup2
HERE IN THE WITNESSES WE HAVE TO

01:17:58.107 --> 01:18:02.678 region:rollup2
MAKE IT EFFECTIVE I REALLY THINK

01:18:00.409 --> 01:18:05.447 region:rollup2
THAT MEANS EVERY PHARMACY.

01:18:02.678 --> 01:18:07.983 region:rollup2
HAS A BOX OF SOME KIND A LOCK

01:18:05.447 --> 01:18:10.119 region:rollup2
BOX THAT TAKES THE DRUGS.

01:18:07.983 --> 01:18:11.387 region:rollup2
ARM THAT THE PHARMACIST SAID HEY

01:18:10.119 --> 01:18:12.788 region:rollup2
IF YOU DON'T FINISH ALL OF THIS

01:18:11.387 --> 01:18:14.023 region:rollup2
BRING IT BACK.

01:40:10.505 --> 01:40:15.910 region:rollup2
FLOOR.

01:40:11.639 --> 01:40:17.678 region:rollup2

HOWEVER I DO THINK THAT'S

01:41:03.557 --> 01:41:06.827 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT WORK OUT OF THE

LIKE A A CLOSER --

01:41:25.579 --> 01:41:30.151 region:rollup2
DEFINITION.

01:41:27.048 --> 01:41:32.053 region:rollup2
OF WHO MIGHT BE A MEDICAL.

01:41:30.151 --> 01:41:33.688 region:rollup2
PERSON TO PITCH YOU COULD DATA

01:41:32.053 --> 01:41:35.022 region:rollup2

UPDATE KNOWLEDGE THE PROBLEM

01:41:38.292 --> 01:41:41.996 region:rollup2

RENTER WHOSE PAIN FOR THE WIDER

01:41:41.996 --> 01:41:46.434 region:rollup2

01:41:46.434 --> 01:41:51.238 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT DEFINITION --

01:41:49.670 --> 01:41:53.474 region:rollup2
AND THEN THERE'S THE QUESTION OF

01:41:51.238 --> 01:41:55.176 region:rollup2
IF IT'S A P. YOU SEE REGULATED

01:41:53.474 --> 01:41:56.811 region:rollup2

01:42:05.219 --> 01:42:08.589 region:rollup2
WHICH I HOPE YOU CAN I DO THINK

01:42:08.589 --> 01:42:13.828 region:rollup2
AS A AS A FLOOR.

01:42:12.093 --> 01:42:15.496 region:rollup2
AND AGAIN IN THE BILL IT DOES

01:42:13.828 --> 01:42:16.364 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY SAY IF YOU HAVE

01:42:15.496 --> 01:42:17.665 region:rollup2
OTHER.

01:42:16.364 --> 01:42:20.534 region:rollup2
WAYS OF REACHING THESE GOALS

01:42:17.665 --> 01:42:21.335 region:rollup2
THAT'S THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING

LIKE THE SUGGESTION FROM THIS

01:51:09.363 --> 01:51:12.332 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE STAFF ABOUT A

01:51:10.597 --> 01:51:14.234 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT APPROACH THAT'S BASED

01:51:17.504 --> 01:51:20.073 region:rollup2
THE COMMITTEE COULD GO IN THAT

01:51:18.572 --> 01:51:21.241 region:rollup2
DIRECTION WE'D LIKE TO REVIEW

01:51:20.073 --> 01:51:22.476 region:rollup2
THE LANGUAGE BUT WE THINK THAT

01:51:21.241 --> 01:51:24.244 region:rollup2
COULD WORK WE DON'T THINK IT

01:51:22.476 --> 01:51:26.113 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE A PERMANENT RULE GOING

01:51:24.244 --> 01:51:28.382 region:rollup2
INTO PERPETUITY --

01:51:26.113 --> 01:51:30.083 region:rollup2
BUT IT WOULD ON HAVE THAT GOV

01:51:28.382 --> 01:51:31.118 region:rollup2

01:51:31.118 --> 01:51:33.253 region:rollup2
FOR AND WE ALSO THINK THERE

01:51:32.486 --> 01:51:34.821 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE A CERTIFIED LAB FOR

01:51:33.253 --> 01:51:36.190 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:51:34.821 --> 01:51:37.424 region:rollup2

BOTTLED WATER STANDARDS ARE.

01:53:21.428 --> 01:53:24.598 region:rollup2
RIDLEY LOWER THAN WHAT OUR TAP

01:53:23.130 --> 01:53:26.199 region:rollup2

IS ACTUALLY GOING TO GET THROUGH

01:53:34.174 --> 01:53:37.110 region:rollup2
ONE OF THOSE SYSTEMS.

01:53:35.642 --> 01:53:38.478 region:rollup2
AND IF IT IS SOMETHING THAT GETS

01:53:37.110 --> 01:53:39.346 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE SYSTEMS IT'S GONNA

01:53:38.478 --> 01:53:40.514 region:rollup2
BE SO SMALL IT'S GONNA GO

01:53:39.346 --> 01:53:42.649 region:rollup2
DIRECTLY INTO YOUR BLOODSTREAM

01:53:40.514 --> 01:53:43.784 region:rollup2

BECAUSE I CAN LEAD TO OTHER

01:54:00.701 --> 01:54:05.272 region:rollup2
THINGS NOW I THINK IT'S HAVE

01:54:02.869 --> 01:54:06.606 region:rollup2
POINT WELL TAKEN AND WITH THE

01:54:05.272 --> 01:54:08.475 region:rollup2

DOING THROUGH THE WHOLE PROCESS.

01:54:13.280 --> 01:54:15.248 region:rollup2
NOT BECAUSE IT IS AN IMPORTANT

01:54:14.114 --> 01:54:16.616 region:rollup2
PIECE OF INFORMATION TO KNOW

01:54:15.248 --> 01:54:18.251 region:rollup2

01:54:21.655 --> 01:54:25.225 region:rollup2
ONGOING DISCUSSIONS SO --

01:54:23.957 --> 01:54:26.727 region:rollup2
I THINK THERE'S ROOM TO PUT

01:59:54.054 --> 01:59:57.624 region:rollup2
FOR THE LAST. TWENTY FOUR YEARS

01:59:56.923 --> 01:59:59.559 region:rollup2
THAT I KNOW.

01:59:57.624 --> 02:00:01.461 region:rollup2
NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE.

01:59:59.559 --> 02:00:03.530 region:rollup2
AND I I APPLAUD.

02:00:01.461 --> 02:00:04.964 region:rollup2
OUR ATTORNEY GENERAL.

02:00:03.530 --> 02:00:07.200 region:rollup2

WHO'S BEEN YOU KNOW THE

02:00:09.736 --> 02:00:12.839 region:rollup2
PRESIDENT OF THE COUNTRY A

02:00:11.604 --> 02:00:14.441 region:rollup2
DOESN'T MATTER IT'S JUST THAT

02:00:12.839 --> 02:00:16.543 region:rollup2
HAS NOT WORKED.

02:00:14.441 --> 02:00:17.210 region:rollup2
THIS HAS NOT BEEN MATE AND A UP

02:00:16.543 --> 02:00:18.845 region:rollup2
PRIOR BUT IT BY ANY

02:00:17.210 --> 02:00:21.347 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION.

02:00:18.845 --> 02:00:22.949 region:rollup2
BUT THIS IS CREATING A A

02:00:21.347 --> 02:00:25.285 region:rollup2
REDUCTION IN PROPERTY VALUES AND

02:00:22.949 --> 02:00:27.120 region:rollup2
IMPERIAL BEACH AND IN SAN DIEGO.

02:00:25.285 --> 02:00:30.757 region:rollup2

IT'S A DISASTER.

02:00:34.594 --> 02:00:37.931 region:rollup2
AND AND AND TIMES UP I THINK THE

02:00:36.596 --> 02:00:39.699 region:rollup2
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS HAD

02:00:37.931 --> 02:00:41.301 region:rollup2
PLENTY OF TIME TO JUST ENFORCE

02:00:39.699 --> 02:00:43.169 region:rollup2
THE TREATIES THAT WE HAVE WE

02:00:41.301 --> 02:00:44.804 region:rollup2
HAVE TREATIES.

02:00:43.169 --> 02:00:46.840 region:rollup2
THAT GET TO THIS ISSUE.

02:00:44.804 --> 02:00:48.942 region:rollup2
AND THERE IS JUST NO ENFORCEMENT

02:00:46.840 --> 02:00:52.045 region:rollup2
NO INTEREST TO MAKE.

02:00:48.942 --> 02:00:53.346 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENTS THERE AND ALL THE

02:00:52.045 --> 02:00:55.615 region:rollup2
DECISIONS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE

02:00:53.346 --> 02:00:57.016 region:rollup2
HAVE ONLY MADE THINGS WORSE.

02:00:55.615 --> 02:00:58.418 region:rollup2
AND WE'RE ASKING THAT THE

02:00:57.016 --> 02:00:59.586 region:rollup2
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DO ITS JOB

02:00:58.418 --> 02:01:01.054 region:rollup2
AND STEP UP AND BE PART OF THE

02:00:59.586 --> 02:01:02.722 region:rollup2
SOLUTION.

02:01:01.054 --> 02:01:04.491 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THIS IS THE STATE IS

02:01:02.722 --> 02:01:06.159 region:rollup2
LIMITED AS TO WEEK WHAT WE CAN

02:01:04.491 --> 02:01:07.093 region:rollup2
DO BECAUSE OF THE BORDER READ

02:01:06.159 --> 02:01:08.061 region:rollup2
REGION.

02:01:07.093 --> 02:01:11.064 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I'VE EVEN TRIED TO

02:01:08.061 --> 02:01:12.499 region:rollup2
CREATE -- US

02:01:11.064 --> 02:01:14.267 region:rollup2
BUT THIS SPECIAL PLANNING OVERS

02:01:12.499 --> 02:01:15.468 region:rollup2
ON THAT CREATES A A WATERSHED

02:01:14.267 --> 02:01:16.569 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR THE QUAN

02:01:15.468 --> 02:01:17.971 region:rollup2
ARRIVE ALLEY.

02:01:16.569 --> 02:01:18.705 region:rollup2
AND OF COURSE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

02:01:17.971 --> 02:01:20.240 region:rollup2
HAS JURISDICTION SO THAT CAN

02:01:18.705 --> 02:01:23.676 region:rollup2
HAPPEN AND WE'VE I HAVE BEEN

02:01:20.240 --> 02:01:25.779 region:rollup2
WORKING ON THIS. FOR FOR FIFTEEN

02:01:23.676 --> 02:01:27.647 region:rollup2
YEARS SO EASILY --

02:01:25.779 --> 02:01:29.516 region:rollup2
AND AND IT'S GETTING FRUSTRATING

02:01:27.647 --> 02:01:30.116 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I JUST DON'T FEEL LIKE

02:01:29.516 --> 02:01:31.417 region:rollup2
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AS OUR

02:01:30.116 --> 02:01:33.086 region:rollup2
PARTNER.

02:01:31.417 --> 02:01:35.321 region:rollup2
IN MANY INSTANCES OF THE MEXICAN

02:01:33.086 --> 02:01:36.623 region:rollup2
SIDE OF THE BORDER HAS BEEN A

02:01:35.321 --> 02:01:37.991 region:rollup2
LITTLE MORE ACCOMMODATING THAT

02:01:36.623 --> 02:01:39.192 region:rollup2
ARE ON FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IT'S

02:01:37.991 --> 02:01:40.560 region:rollup2
JUST IT'S JUST A MASSIVE

02:01:39.192 --> 02:01:42.996 region:rollup2
BUREAUCRACY AND I THINK THE ONLY

02:01:40.560 --> 02:01:45.465 region:rollup2
THING THAT WE NEED TO RESOLVE

02:01:42.996 --> 02:01:47.133 region:rollup2
THIS IS IS A JUDICIAL DECISION.

02:01:45.465 --> 02:01:47.734 region:rollup2
AND I THINK IF WE PUT DISTANCE

02:01:47.133 --> 02:01:49.202 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE COURTS THAT WOULD

02:01:47.734 --> 02:01:51.171 region:rollup2
REALLY HELP.

02:01:49.202 --> 02:01:52.472 region:rollup2

02:01:51.171 --> 02:01:55.975 region:rollup2

CONCERNS ABOUT THE MECHANICS OF

02:09:59.592 --> 02:10:04.530 region:rollup2
ON THAT SENATOR MONNING HAS PUT

02:10:01.127 --> 02:10:06.265 region:rollup2
FORWARD AND WE BELIEVE THIS --

02:10:04.530 --> 02:10:08.334 region:rollup2
THAT THE PROVISION OF WATER

02:10:06.265 --> 02:10:08.868 region:rollup2
TREATMENT AT THAT BACKEND AS IT

02:10:08.334 --> 02:10:12.371 region:rollup2

02:10:12.371 --> 02:10:16.108 region:rollup2
NAMELY OF FINDING THE FUNDING

02:10:14.740 --> 02:10:18.277 region:rollup2
THE ABILITY OF THE COMMUNITY TO

SUPPORT THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT

02:10:18.277 --> 02:10:24.450 region:rollup2
IS MADE AVAILABLE.

02:10:20.313 --> 02:10:28.254 region:rollup2
AND THE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

EXPAND EXISTING SYSTEMS AND

02:10:28.254 --> 02:10:30.923 region:rollup2
EQUITABLY DISTRIBUTE THE COST OF

02:10:37.630 --> 02:10:42.635 region:rollup2

02:10:52.645 --> 02:10:56.082 region:rollup2
THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS.

02:10:53.913 --> 02:10:58.517 region:rollup2
BUT WE DO HAVE SOME RESERVATIONS

02:10:56.082 --> 02:11:01.020 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE CURRENT APPROACH AND I

02:10:58.517 --> 02:11:02.955 region:rollup2

WE'D BE VERY HAPPY.

02:11:06.559 --> 02:11:10.730 region:rollup2
PROPOSED AMENDMENTS THAT MIGHT

02:11:08.394 --> 02:11:11.530 region:rollup2
GET TO SOME OF THE MECHANICS OF

02:11:10.730 --> 02:11:12.832 region:rollup2
PROVIDING THEM FUNDING TO MAKE

02:11:11.530 --> 02:11:15.201 region:rollup2

02:11:41.560 --> 02:11:44.764 region:rollup2
AMENDMENTS ARE GOING TO IMPACT

02:11:42.962 --> 02:11:46.732 region:rollup2
WASTE WATER AGENCIES BUT THERE

02:11:44.764 --> 02:11:48.901 region:rollup2
ARE A FEW SPECIFIC COMPONENT

THAT ARE PARTICULARLY AND

02:11:48.901 --> 02:11:51.771 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT FOR US AND THESE

02:11:50.169 --> 02:11:53.305 region:rollup2
INCLUDE THE NEW LANGUAGE --

02:11:51.771 --> 02:11:55.074 region:rollup2
THAT ALLOWS THE REGIONAL BOARD

02:11:53.305 --> 02:11:57.777 region:rollup2

TO THAT ACCESS CAPACITY FOR FIVE

02:12:01.213 --> 02:12:03.616 region:rollup2
YEARS AND THAT'S AT WITHOUT

PAYING THE CONNECTION FEES

02:12:03.616 --> 02:12:06.819 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATED WITH THE ADDITIONAL

02:12:04.950 --> 02:12:08.587 region:rollup2
CAPACITY --

02:12:06.819 --> 02:12:10.890 region:rollup2
WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT A

02:12:08.587 --> 02:12:12.258 region:rollup2
LOCAL AGENCIES DUE PROCESS

02:12:10.890 --> 02:12:13.459 region:rollup2

02:12:23.302 --> 02:12:25.938 region:rollup2
HAMBURG OUTLINED IN THE BILL

02:12:25.404 --> 02:12:27.873 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE CLARIFIED AS TO

02:12:25.938 --> 02:12:29.408 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT'S A BINDING

02:12:27.873 --> 02:12:30.876 region:rollup2
REGULATORY DOCUMENT OR IF IT'S

02:12:29.408 --> 02:12:32.511 region:rollup2
MORE OF A FLEXIBLE GUIDANCE

02:12:30.876 --> 02:12:33.546 region:rollup2

02:12:32.511 --> 02:12:34.980 region:rollup2
WE JUST HAVE SOME PRACTICAL

02:12:33.546 --> 02:12:36.882 region:rollup2
CONCERNS.

02:12:34.980 --> 02:12:38.517 region:rollup2
WITH HOW THIS PROCESS WOULD WORK

02:12:36.882 --> 02:12:39.552 region:rollup2
KIND OF ON THE GROUND --

02:12:38.517 --> 02:12:40.686 region:rollup2
IT'S UNCLEAR WHO WOULD DETERMINE

02:12:39.552 --> 02:12:42.488 region:rollup2
THE COST OF INTERCONNECTION

02:12:40.686 --> 02:12:43.522 region:rollup2
WHETHER THAT.

YOU NOW --

02:12:43.522 --> 02:12:46.192 region:rollup2
OTHER THINGS LIKE WHETHER THE

02:12:44.757 --> 02:12:47.827 region:rollup2
FEES ARE REASONABLE.

02:12:46.192 --> 02:12:49.829 region:rollup2
WHAT FORM THE REASON REGIONAL

02:12:47.827 --> 02:12:51.430 region:rollup2
BOARDS ORDER WOULD TAKE --

02:12:49.829 --> 02:12:53.933 region:rollup2
SO YOU KNOW IS THIS IN FORSMAN

02:12:51.430 --> 02:12:55.167 region:rollup2
ORDER AGAINST A LOCAL AGENCY WE

02:12:53.933 --> 02:12:55.868 region:rollup2
DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S

02:12:55.167 --> 02:12:58.204 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE --

02:12:55.868 --> 02:13:00.472 region:rollup2
SINCE WE HAVEN'T HAD A WATER

02:12:58.204 --> 02:13:02.675 region:rollup2
QUALITY VIOLATION IN THIS

02:13:00.472 --> 02:13:03.976 region:rollup2
CIRCUMSTANCE I IT'S ALSO UNCLEAR

02:13:02.675 --> 02:13:04.643 region:rollup2
HOW THESE ACTIONS WOULD WORK

02:13:03.976 --> 02:13:07.213 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH

02:13:04.643 --> 02:13:09.882 region:rollup2
MULTIPLE LOCAL AGENCIES SO.

02:13:07.213 --> 02:13:12.051 region:rollup2
IN SOME CASES THE NEAREST

02:13:09.882 --> 02:13:13.519 region:rollup2
ADJACENT LOCAL SYSTEM WOULD BE

02:13:12.051 --> 02:13:14.520 region:rollup2
LIKE A CITY.

02:13:13.519 --> 02:13:17.490 region:rollup2
ARE OWNED AND OPERATED

02:24:36.268 --> 02:24:39.971 region:rollup2
PRIVATE DOLLARS.

02:24:38.303 --> 02:24:40.939 region:rollup2
SO THE PATHWAY NUMBER TWO THE

02:24:39.971 --> 02:24:42.607 region:rollup2
PATHWAY FOR BUSINESSES TO

02:24:40.939 --> 02:24:45.143 region:rollup2
INSTALL THE SYSTEMS.

02:24:42.607 --> 02:24:46.411 region:rollup2
VERY UNCLEAR IN CALIFORNIA THREE

02:24:48.713 --> 02:24:52.617 region:rollup2
REDEVELOPMENT PLANS AND THERE'S

02:24:50.315 --> 02:24:54.286 region:rollup2
NO CLEAR PERMITTING PATHWAY TO

02:24:52.617 --> 02:24:56.188 region:rollup2
GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE FACEBOOK.

02:24:54.286 --> 02:24:58.223 region:rollup2

PURSUING A PERMIT SINCE TWO

02:24:58.223 --> 02:25:01.393 region:rollup2
THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN FOR SYSTEM

02:24:59.457 --> 02:25:02.861 region:rollup2
THAT CAN SAVE SEVENTEEN MILLION

02:25:01.393 --> 02:25:04.729 region:rollup2
GALLONS ANNUALLY.

02:25:02.861 --> 02:25:06.631 region:rollup2
AND FINALLY THREE COUNTIES AND

02:25:04.729 --> 02:25:07.966 region:rollup2
CITIES THEY NEED STATE GUIDANCE

02:25:06.631 --> 02:25:09.935 region:rollup2
AND WE ARE PART OF A LOCAL WATER

02:25:07.966 --> 02:25:11.770 region:rollup2
AND EFFICIENCY TASK FORCE BACK%

02:25:09.935 --> 02:25:12.370 region:rollup2
IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN BUT

02:25:11.770 --> 02:25:13.438 region:rollup2
CITIES THE COUNTY IN THE WATER

02:25:12.370 --> 02:25:14.940 region:rollup2
DISTRICT.

02:25:13.438 --> 02:25:16.274 region:rollup2
AND WE DEVELOPED A MODEL

02:25:14.940 --> 02:25:17.275 region:rollup2
ORDINANCE BUT BE IT'S BEEN

02:25:16.274 --> 02:25:19.110 region:rollup2
REALLY HARD TO GET IT PASSED

02:25:17.275 --> 02:25:20.779 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THERE'S A RELUCTANCE.

02:25:19.110 --> 02:25:21.379 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE POTENTIAL IMPACT

02:25:20.779 --> 02:25:22.681 region:rollup2
PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE LACK OF

SEEK GUIDANCE.

02:25:22.681 --> 02:25:25.884 region:rollup2
SO SB NINE SIX SIX INCLUSION IT

02:25:25.083 --> 02:25:27.419 region:rollup2
WILL ADDRESS BOTH THESE OF

02:25:25.884 --> 02:25:28.920 region:rollup2
OBJECTION.

02:25:29.888 --> 02:25:32.724 region:rollup2
STANDARDS THAT ARE PROTECTIVE OF

PUBLIC HEALTH PROVIDE GUIDANCE

02:25:32.724 --> 02:25:35.994 region:rollup2
FOR CITIES AND COUNTIES.

02:25:34.593 --> 02:25:38.263 region:rollup2
A SMART BILL KEEP THE PUBLIC

QUALITY STANDARDS AND I SAY THIS

02:27:09.821 --> 02:27:14.192 region:rollup2
JUST FOR THE SIMPLE FACT THAT

02:27:11.489 --> 02:27:15.427 region:rollup2
BOTTLED WATER QUALITY STANDARDS.

02:27:14.192 --> 02:27:17.228 region:rollup2

WATER STANDARDS.

02:27:17.228 --> 02:27:22.300 region:rollup2
AND RESIDENTS USUALLY DON'T LIKE
