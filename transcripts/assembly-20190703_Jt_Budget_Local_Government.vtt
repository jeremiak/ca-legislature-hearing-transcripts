SOMETHING.

00:31:55.613 --> 00:31:57.882
I HAD A COUPLE QUESTIONS ABOUT --

00:31:57.949 --> 00:31:59.717
THE BILL AND LET ME START BY

00:31:59.784 --> 00:32:01.953
TALKING FOCUSING ON THE PART

00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:03.788
THAT GIVES THE STATE REMEDIES

00:32:03.855 --> 00:32:05.323
INCLUDING FINDS IN APPOINTING AN

00:32:05.390 --> 00:32:07.892
AGENT OF THE COURT -- FOR

00:32:07.959 --> 00:32:10.295
BRINGING CITIES INTO COMPLIANCE

00:32:10.361 --> 00:32:11.996
I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE

00:32:12.063 --> 00:32:14.332
ARE ONLY PENALIZING CITIES FOR

00:32:14.399 --> 00:32:16.367
THESE ELEMENTS OF THEIR HOUSING

00:32:16.434 --> 00:32:17.135
ELEMENT THAT ARE UNDER THEIR

00:32:17.201 --> 00:32:19.137
CONTROL -- THINGS LIKE ZONING

00:32:19.203 --> 00:32:21.506
AND PLANNING AND NOT FOR BECAUSE

00:32:21.572 --> 00:32:22.473
I KNOW THE GOVERNOR ORIGINALLY

00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:23.975
HAD PROPOSED WITH THE SP ONE

00:32:24.042 --> 00:32:25.543
MONEY TO PENALIZE CITIES FOR

00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:27.312
FAILING TO PRODUCE HOUSING.

00:32:27.378 --> 00:32:28.479
WHICH I THINK WAS UNFAIR BECAUSE

00:32:28.546 --> 00:32:29.981
IT PENALIZES PERSON SOMETHING

00:32:30.048 --> 00:32:31.149
CITIES FOR SOMETHING THAT WASN'T

00:32:31.215 --> 00:32:32.750
IN THEIR CONTROL YOU KNOW THE

00:32:32.817 --> 00:32:33.985
THE ACTUAL PRODUCTION HOUSING

00:32:34.052 --> 00:32:35.486
WHICH IS NOT THE CITY'S JOB.

00:32:35.553 --> 00:32:37.622
SO THIS IS JUST FOR THE ZONING

00:32:37.689 --> 00:32:39.590
AND PLANNING ELEMENTS OF THE

00:32:39.657 --> 00:32:41.159
HOUSING ELEMENT FREE CITY RIGHT

00:32:41.225 --> 00:32:42.360
THAT'S CORRECT THIS BILL IS FOR

00:32:42.427 --> 00:32:43.394
COMPLIANCE WITH THE EXISTING

00:32:43.461 --> 00:32:45.129
HOUSING ELEMENT LAW SO IT DOES

00:32:45.196 --> 00:32:46.764
NOT HAVE THAT PRODUCTION IT AS A

00:32:46.831 --> 00:32:49.367
PRODUCTION GOAL -- BUT THE LEGAL

00:32:49.434 --> 00:32:50.768
STANDARD IS WHETHER YOUR ZONING

00:32:50.835 --> 00:32:52.603
AND PLANNING FOR THE HOUSING AS

00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:54.172
PRESCRIBED BY LAW.

00:32:54.238 --> 00:32:55.139
OKAY THANK YOU AND I'M TALKING

00:32:55.206 --> 00:32:57.442
ABOUT THE GRANT FUNDING SO WE'VE

00:32:57.508 --> 00:32:59.277
GOT TO BIG POOLS OF MONEY HERE

00:32:59.344 --> 00:33:00.478
WE GOT THE INFILL INFRASTRUCTURE

00:33:00.545 --> 00:33:02.847
GRANT PROGRAM AND THEN THE HAP.

00:33:02.914 --> 00:33:04.982
PROGRAM -- WE HAD ASKED FOR A

00:33:05.049 --> 00:33:07.585
SET ASIDE FOR SMALL AND RURAL

00:33:07.652 --> 00:33:08.920
CITIES AND COUNTIES FOR BOTH

00:33:08.986 --> 00:33:10.822
PROGRAMS AND I'M VERY HAPPY THAT

00:33:10.888 --> 00:33:13.858
WE GOT THAT 18% SET ASIDE.

00:33:13.925 --> 00:33:15.259
FOR A INFILL INFRASTRUCTURE BUT

00:33:15.326 --> 00:33:17.595
THE THE THAT WE DID NOT GET THAT

00:33:17.662 --> 00:33:21.933
SET ASIDE FOR THE HALF PROGRAM

00:33:21.999 --> 00:33:23.701
IS THAT CORRECT.

00:33:23.768 --> 00:33:25.103
DON'T BELIEVE SO OR TURNED OVER

00:33:25.169 --> 00:33:27.238
TO MY COLLEAGUE.

00:33:27.305 --> 00:33:27.839
DANIELLE BRENDA DEPARTMENT OF

00:33:27.905 --> 00:33:28.506
FINANCE I DON'T BELIEVE WE SET A

00:33:28.573 --> 00:33:30.675
MINIMUM FOR THE SMALL

00:33:30.742 --> 00:33:32.310
JURISDICTIONS.

00:33:32.377 --> 00:33:32.977
OKAY.

00:33:33.044 --> 00:33:34.278
YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S KIND OF A

00:33:34.345 --> 00:33:36.247
PROBLEM BECAUSE THE SMALLER

00:33:36.314 --> 00:33:38.282
JURISDICTIONS ALSO HAVE A LARGE

00:33:38.349 --> 00:33:39.684
AND GROWING HOMELESS PROBLEM.

00:33:39.751 --> 00:33:41.085
THEIR PARTS OF MY DISTRICT WHERE

00:33:41.152 --> 00:33:42.420
WE'RE SEEING HOMELESSNESS WHERE

00:33:42.487 --> 00:33:43.955
WE HAVE NEVER SEEN HOMELESSNESS

00:33:44.021 --> 00:33:44.622
IN THE PAST.

00:33:44.689 --> 00:33:47.258
AND IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR THE

00:33:47.325 --> 00:33:48.593
SMALLER JURISDICTIONS TO COMPETE

00:33:48.659 --> 00:33:50.228
WITH BIG JURISDICTIONS LIKE LOS

00:33:50.294 --> 00:33:52.764
ANGELES FOR THESE FUNDS SO -- I

00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:54.332
I REALLY HOPE THAT IN THE FUTURE

00:33:54.399 --> 00:33:57.268
WE LOOK AT AT MAKING IT EASIER

00:33:57.335 --> 00:33:58.903
FOR THOSE SMALLER JURISDICTIONS

00:33:58.970 --> 00:34:00.471
TO COMPETE AND SETTING ASIDE A

00:34:00.538 --> 00:34:01.939
PORTION OF THE MONEY. TO MAKE

00:34:02.006 --> 00:34:02.507
SURE THAT THE PROBLEM GETS

00:34:02.573 --> 00:34:05.076
ADDRESSED IN THOSE PORTIONS OF

00:34:05.143 --> 00:34:09.113
THE STATE AS WELL.

00:34:09.180 --> 00:34:11.616
THANK YOU ANY.

00:34:11.682 --> 00:34:14.619

MR LOOK.

00:34:17.422 --> 00:34:19.390
I'M THINKING BACK -- TO I THINK

00:34:19.457 --> 00:34:21.092
IT WAS TWENTY SEVENTEEN WHEN WE

00:34:21.159 --> 00:34:22.894
PASSED THE OF BIG HOUSING

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:24.429
PACKAGE AND PART OF THAT WAS A.

00:34:24.495 --> 00:34:28.065
B.. SEVENTY TWO I THINK IT WAS

00:34:28.132 --> 00:34:29.534
MISTER SANTIAGO IS LEGISLATION

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:31.702
ON ENFORCEMENT.

00:34:31.769 --> 00:34:33.371
HOW DO THESE THINGS WORK

00:34:33.438 --> 00:34:35.273
TOGETHER?

00:34:35.339 --> 00:34:36.941
CENTS EXIST I GUESS THE QUESTION

TOGETHER WITH WHAT'S BEING

00:34:41.245 --> 00:34:43.314
PROPOSED.

00:34:43.381 --> 00:34:45.283
SURE FOR H. CD'S THE MY

00:34:45.349 --> 00:34:47.218

EACH CITIES CONTINUED EFFORTS TO

00:34:59.964 --> 00:35:00.998

BEFORE THE PARTIES ENTER INTO

00:35:28.726 --> 00:35:30.394

FUNDING WHILE SIGNIFICAN IS

00:37:13.497 --> 00:37:14.999

A HEAP I BELIEVE IT'S A HOMELESS

00:37:33.184 --> 00:37:34.619
EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS.

00:37:34.685 --> 00:37:36.621

BIG CITIES HAD THE BIGGEST

00:37:43.427 --> 00:37:44.929
ELEVEN CITIES -- SO WE ACTUALLY

00:37:44.996 --> 00:37:47.264
DROPPED -- IN THIS YEAR'S ACTION

00:37:47.331 --> 00:37:49.133

CITY THAT WAS INCLUDED -- BUT WE

00:38:04.949 --> 00:38:07.084

UNIQUE NEEDS THAT NEED TO BE

00:38:10.488 --> 00:38:12.490
ADDRESSED -- BUT THE BALANCE OF

00:38:12.556 --> 00:38:14.058
THE FUNDING MORE THAN HALF GOES

00:38:14.125 --> 00:38:16.027
TO COUNTIES AND GOES TO THE

00:38:16.093 --> 00:38:16.961

ALL AREAS OF THE STATE WILL BE

00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:24.902
ABLE TO APPLY FOR THAT MONEY.

00:38:24.969 --> 00:38:26.637

I'M JUST BRINGING THAT UP

00:39:02.073 --> 00:39:04.308

THE BIG THIRTEEN SHOULD

00:39:44.582 --> 00:39:45.182
DEFINITELY WORK WITH THE COUNTY
