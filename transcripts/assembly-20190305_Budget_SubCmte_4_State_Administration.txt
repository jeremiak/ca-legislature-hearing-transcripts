BACK TO SUBCOMMITTEE. FOUR TABLE DISCUSS THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSALS REGARDING BUDGET RESERVES DEBT AND PENSIONS. THIS IS AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING ONLY. NO ACTION WILL BE TAKEN. THIS IS ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS WE MAY LATER IN THE PROCESS WE HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF THE OF REVENUES. FOR TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY WE WILL CALL THE STEPS QUORUM PLEASE. COOPER HERE. TOO LACKEY -- THIS AREA WICKS. WE'LL HEAR FROM EACH OF THE THREE PANELS ALLOW MEMBERS TO ASK QUESTIONS AFTER EACH PANEL IT TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT AT THE END. OF THE SPEAKERS ON THE FIRST PANEL REGARDING RESERVES CAM THE TABLE PLEASE PLEASE PROCEED [inaudible] OFFICE [inaudible] TODAY FROM. YEAH AND I'LL BE INTRODUCING EACH OF THE THREE YEARS AND I AM SITTING FROM BACK END UP. SO -- YEAH. WE DIE. YOU GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL SPECIFICALLY -- I JUST TO START WITH A LITTLE BIT OF A PICTURE OF THE OVERALL STRUCTURE FOR THE GOVERNOR. FOR THE FIRST. WE ALWAYS ARE [inaudible] BILLION DOLLARS. THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES A PRETTY MAJOR. YEAH MY ABILITY [inaudible] TWO FIRST IS PAYING TAO BUDGETARY BORROWING THE SECOND LIABILITIES -- PROVIDES ROUGHLY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS FOR ONE TIME SPENDING THIS IS MONEY THAT WILL BE SPENT IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY THAT THAT [inaudible] YOU. FOR AND THE GOVERNOR ALSO PROVIDES TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN ONGOING SPENDING THAT'S MONEY THAT WOULD BE SPENT TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY AND THEN EVERY YEAR AFTER. THE FULL IMPLEMENTATION COSTS OF THOSE ARE GOING FOR SCHOOLS IS THREE FIVE FIVE DOLLARS. TURNING TO THE NEXT CASE -- ON THE GOVERNOR'S RESERVE LEVELS. WE GO. OVER LOT. OF EIGHTEEN BILLION DOLLARS. INCREASE OF ABOUT TWO BILLION DOLLARS RELATIVE TO THE EIGHTEEN BUDGET ACT. THAT WOULD BE ACROSS THE STATE. THREE OF THE STATE'S RESERVES THE BSA THE HALF OUR OFFICE HAS. OPTIONAL SCENARIOS REGARDING HOW MUCH. WIRED TO COVER SOMETHING RELATED TO A MILE OR A MODERATE RECESSION. AND WE FOUND THAT ASSUMING THAT THE LEGISLATURE DOESN'T WANT TO REDUCE SPENDING ARE INCREASED REVENUE. FOR SESSION ABOUT TWENTY TO FORTY BILLION DOLLARS FIRE. OUR HIS ALTHOUGH PUBLICATION FROM LAST NOVEMBER ALSO LOOKED AT A COUPLE DIFFERENT SCENARIOS AND FOUND THAT THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN. NEW SPENDING WOULD BE SUPPORT PROVIDED AT THE STATE AND HER THE REST OF THE SESSION SCENARIO WITH TWENTY FIVE BILLION OR SO IN LIGHT OF THIS WE THINK THAT BUILDING MORE RESERVES RELATIVE TO WHAT THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES OF EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLARS WOULD BE -- THAT WOULD BE PARTICULARLY IN THE CASE OF THE LEGISLATURE AGREES WITH THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO SPEND THREE BILLION DOLLARS. I HAVE A QUICK QUESTION FOR YOU THE LAST RECESSION THERE ARE MANY MANY PROGRAMS THAT WERE NEVER FULLY REFUNDED. THE PRESENT DAY TODAY. SO WE'RE STILL I MEAN IT IT OBVIOUSLY -- RESERVES WERE COMPATIBLE BACK THEN BUT EVEN NOW. IF WE DID OTHER RECESSION. OF THE WOLD BE CATASTROPHIC IN MY IN MY OPINION. CAN YOU RESPOND TO THAT. YES AND I MEAN THE LAST RECESSION INVOLVED HUGE MULTI BILLION DOLLAR. LOSSES AND BUDGET SHORTFALL. THE RECESSION IN OUR ESTIMATES WAS ASSOCIATED A HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS COLLECTIVELY ON THE BUDGET SHORTFALL. THAT RECESSION WAS OBVIOUSLY VERY. MOST ECONOMISTS YOU PROBABLY ARE EXTREME ABOUT THAT YOU KNOW IS THAT I WAS LIKELY TO OCCUR IN THE FUTURE SO WHEN WE'RE LOOKING EVERYWHERE -- YOU KNOW WILL CERTAINLY LEGISLATURE COULD AIMS TO COVER ABOUT IT. FOR MAGNITUDE IT'S UNLIKELY THAT -- THE BUDGET SHORTFALL WOULD BE QUITE THAT LARGE IT AGAIN IN THE FUTURE [inaudible] OKAY [inaudible] FINANCE. SUSAN WHAT KINDA DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THANK YOU SO CHAIR -- THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES PROPOSAL TAKES A BALANCED APPROACH. ON TO CONTINUES TO BE RESOLVES. AND BETTER PREPARE THE STATE FOR AN ECONOMY DOWNTOWN. THE STATE'S RESERVES AS YELLOW MENTION A COMPRISE OF THE RAINY DAY FUND. THE SAFETY NET RESOLVE. AND A SPECIAL FUND FOR ECONOMIC -- ON COLLECTIVELY HAVE BOY ESTIMATED TO HAVE A BALANCE OF EIGHTEEN BILLION. IN FISCAL YEAR -- NINETEEN TWENTY BALANCES IN THESE RESULTS ARE AVAILABLE. TO SUPPORT ANY STICK NEEDS -- I DO OF COURSE REGARD RESERVES -- ACTION A QUESTION OF THE SPECIAL FUND FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTIES IS INTENDED TO COVER BUDGET SHORTFALLS FROM RECESSIONS. FROM OTHER NATURAL DISASTERS SHOULD THERE BE A SEPARATE DISASTER RESERVE FUND. IF SO OR THE POSITIVE NEGATIVES OF DOING SO. CERTAINLY SO -- ONE THING THAT WE MENTIONED IN A RECENT REPORT IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER SAVING. BOTH FOR AN ECONOMIC RECESSION AND FOR A NATURAL DISASTER SHOULD THOSE THINGS OCCUR SIMULTANEOUSLY AND WHEN WE HAVE PRESENTED ESTIMATES OF YOU KNOW RESERVE TARGETS IN THE PAST THOSE GENERALLY JUST FOCUS ON A RECESSION BUT IF. YOU KNOW A HUGE FIRE ABOUT FOR EXAMPLE HAPPENED AT THE SAME TIME AS A RECESSION RESERVES WOULD BE NEEDED TO COVER BOTH SITUATIONS. AND SO YOU KNOW THE EXACT FORM SERVICE WERE SAVED COULD VERY --% YOU COULD CHOOSE TO PUT IT ALL IN ONE ACCOUNT YOU COULD CHOOSE TO PUT IT IN SEPARATE ACCOUNTS THE ADVANTAGE OF PUTTING IT IN SEPARATE ACCOUNTS IS OF COURSE. IT JUST HELPS SORT OF CLARIFY YOU KNOW THE USE OF WHAT EACH OF THOSE RESERVES TO BE INTENDED FOR SIMILAR TO HOW HOUSEHOLD MIGHT HAVE A SAVINGS ACCOUNT FOR AN EMERGENCY IN A SEPARATE SAVINGS ACCOUNT -- FOR SOMETHING ELSE SO -- IT IT MAY MIGHT BE HELPFUL BUT AT THE YOU KNOW AT THE SAME AT THE END OF THE DAY YOU KNOW HAVING THE MONEY AVAILABLE IS REALLY THE MOST IMPORTANT THING. THE QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE% IF YOU. THIS WILL THE PANEL OVER. TO SUSAN I KIND OF WOULD LIKE TO ADD SOMETHING TO ON THE SEPARATE RESOLVE SURE UP SO WE APPRECIATE THE THINKING BEHIND THE OPTION TO CREATE A SEPARATE RESOLVE -- FOR PAYING FOR OTHER DISASTER RELATED COSTS -- WOULD NOT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD LIKE. TO ME TO RETAIN AS MUCH FLEXIBILITY AS POSSIBLE TO ADDRESS STRAIGHT STATE NEEDS. ON THAT CREATING A SEPARATE RESOLVE FOR SPECIFIC PAPPAS REDUCES THAT FLEXIBILITY -- WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF FINDING OUT OF THE S. IF YOU HAS HISTORICALLY. BEEN USED TO SATISFY THE NEEDS THE STATE'S NEEDS FOR EMERGENCIES NATURAL DISASTERS. AND DISASTER RECOVERY -- THE END OF RECESSION IS NOT ENOUGH WAS HE HOWEVER WE ARE HAPPY TO CONTINUE HAVING ON GOING DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THAT. THANK YOU SIMILAR MANNER TO THE DISASTERS WERE SEEING WITH THE FIRES AND FLOODS OR IF INCREASED DRAMATICALLY A MEMBER FOR RESPONDING BACK TO FIRES BACK IN THE LATE EIGHTIES EARLY NINETIES. THERE'S DEFINITELY SMALLER BECAUSE THAT THE COST -- FOR THESE DISASTERS WHY WOULD IT LIMIT FLEXIBILITY IF YOU TO PUT IN TWO SEPARATE FUNDS -- WE DO WE DO APPRECIATE -- THAT THEY HAVE BEEN DIFFICULTIES IN THE ECONOMY BUT THE ADMINISTRATION FEELS THAT. THE RESULTS WE HAVE CURRENTLY ON THE A MULTI PRONGED APPROACH THE BUS APPROACH WE ARE TAKING LOOKING AT THE LONG TOM. IS. IS IN TO TO A LARGE EXTENT ADDRESSING SOME OF THESE NEEDS. BUT I I GUESS WHAT I'M TRYING TO WRAP MY ARMS AROUND GOING BACK TO THE THE PREVIOUS RECESSION HAVE A GREAT IT WAS. HE STILL PROGRAMS THAT ARE FUNDED RIGHT NOW TO THIS DAY IN YEAH THE THE EXT RECESSION MAY NOT BE AS IMPACTFUL AS IT WAS. YOU KNOW THE PREVIOUS ONE STILL. WE PROGRAMS ARE FUNDED SO I MEAN. TO ME YOU CAN EVER HAVE A LARGER LARGE ENOUGH RESERVE SO AND JUST. TRAFFIC WE HAVE TO SEPARATE AND NEVER GOT PROBLEMS RIGHT NOW IT'S GOING TO BE WITH THE THE ARCTIC BLAST WHATEVER IT'S CALLED -- YOU KNOW WE'RE GONNA DO YOU HAVE MORE PROBLEMS SO I AM NOT SURE IF I AGREE WITH YOU TOTALLY ON THAT BUT WOULD DO WE NOTED THANK YOU. SO ON THE PANEL NUMBER TWO OKAY. I'M SO PAGE THREE OF YOUR HAND OUT INTRODUCES THE GOVERNOR'S OB BUDGETARY BORROWING PROPOSALS AS WELL AS OUR COMMENTS RELATED AND RECOMMENDATIONS RELATED TO THOSE PROPOSALS. SO -- THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES A TOTAL BUDGETARY BORROWING PACKAGE OF FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS THAT BUDGETARY BORROWING BEING OUTSTANDING AMOUNTS THAT THE GENERAL FUND STILL OWES THAT -- IT USED TO BORROWING THAT USED TO ADDRESS FOR FALLS IN THE PAST -- AT THE TWO MAJOR COMPONENTS OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS ARE TO REPAY TWO BILLION DOLLARS APPROXIMATELY TWO POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN SPECIAL FUND LOANS. AND THEN TO REPAY ONE POINT SEVEN TO BUDGETARY DEFERRALS. ARE THE SPECIAL FUND LOANS WOULD THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WOULD ELIMINATE WHAT IS AN EXISTING MULTI YEAR PLAN TO ADDRESS THOSE SPECIAL FUND LOANS OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS -- AND THEN WOULD REPAY THE ENTIRETY OF THAT AMOUNT IN IN NINETEEN TWENTY JUST USING GENERAL FUND AVAILABLE RESOURCES. ON THE ON THE TO BUDGETARY DEFERRALS -- ONE IS A PAYROLL DEFERRAL AND WHICH JUNE PAYROLL FOR STATE EMPLOYEES AS REFLECTED AS IT FROM JUST AN ACCOUNTING PERSPECTIVE IN JULY. ON THIS DOES NOT AFFECT WHEN STATE EMPLOYEES ARE PAID -- AND THEN THE SECOND IS THAT THE FOURTH QUARTER PAYMENT TO CALPERS GOES OUT IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF THE FOLLOWING FISCAL YEAR JUST A FEW DAYS LATE. I'M BOTH OF THESE ARE ACTUALLY ASSOCIATED WITH ONGOING BUDGETARY SAVINGS BECAUSE THE YOU KNOW PREVIOUS JUNE'S. PAYMENT FOR STATE EMPLOYEE PAYROLLS ACTUALLY A LITTLE BIT CHEAPER THAN THE UPCOMING JUNE BECAUSE PAYROLL TENDS TO GROW OVER TIME AND SO THAT. THERE'S ABOUT A HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS IN SAVINGS EACH YEAR THAT THE BUDGET ACCUMULATES AS A RESULT OF THESE JUST ONGOING ACTIONS. SO WE HAVE TWO RECOMMENDATIONS RELATED TO THE IS THE FIRST ARM RELATED TO THE SPECIAL FUND LOANS. WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE PRIORITIZE HIGH INTEREST LIABILITIES LIKE MAKING A SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT TO THE PENSION SYSTEMS OVER REPAYING THE SPECIAL PHONE LINES OF THIS YEAR. AND THAT'S BECAUSE PENSION PAYMENTS HAVE MUCH HIGHER INTEREST RATES ASSOCIATED WITH THEM SPECIAL FUND LOANS HAVE VERY LOWER SOMETIMES NO INTEREST AT ALL. AND THE STATE COULD SAVE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF IF IT PRIORITIZE THOSE HIGHER INTEREST LIABILITIES. LET ME KNOW DIFFERENT IN A A HOMEOWNER CARDHOLDER PAYING OFF THEIR HIGH INTEREST EXACTLY EXACTLY. I'M. MORE AND THEN OF COURSE THE STATE WOULD KEEP ITS CURRENT PLAN THAT IT ALREADY HAS IN PLACE TO ADDRESS THE SPECIAL FOR MONTHS OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS. WE ALSO RECOMMEND REJECTING THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO UNDO THE TWO DEFERRALS -- AND THERE ARE TWO REASONS FOR THIS THE FIRST IS THAT ESSENTIALLY IT BE YOU KNOW AS I MENTIONED BEFORE THESE BOTH INVOLVE SOME STATE SAVINGS THAT ARE ON GOING. BUT ALSO THE ADMINISTRATION HAS% INDICATED THAT ONE OF THE REASONS TO UNDO THESE DEFERRALS IS TO PUT A TOOL BACK IN THE TOOL BOX FOR THE STATE TO USE AGAIN IN A FUTURE RECESSION. THIS IS MORE LIKE A RESERVE ACTION THAN IT IS LIKE A DEATH ACTION. AND SO AS A RESULT WE RECOMMEND USING THAT ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IF YOU WANTED TO BUILD MORE RESERVES WITH ACTUALLY JUST PUTTING THAT MONEY IN RESERVE BECAUSE YOU ARE IN A LITTLE BIT INTEREST ON THAT MONEY YOU WOULD JUST KEEP THE STATE SAVINGS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED FROM. YEAR TO YEAR AND IT WOULD JUST BE A LITTLE BIT MORE CERTAIN -- THAN THE UNCERTAINTY AROUND DO ON DOING AND REDOING IT TO FOR ALL. HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS. FINANCE. GREG BREAST DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IS CERTAINLY TO THE DEBT SO WHILE WE RECOGNIZE THERE ARE SEVERAL DIFFERENT TRADE OFFS WHETHER IT'S RETIREMENT LIABILITIES ARE BUDGETARY DEBT OR PUTTING MORE RESERVES SIDE -- THIS APPROACH WAS CAN EVEN HANDEDLY RECOGNIZING ALL THE DIFFERENT. TO THAT GETS OUT THERE IN TRYING -- TO TO TAKE A A PLAN FORWARD THAT WOULD PAY OFF CERTAIN THINGS AND THEN ALSO ADDRESS SHORT TERM WHICH IS MORE THE BUDGETARY LOANS PAYING THOSE OFF. IN THE LONG TERM DEBT OF THE RETIREMENT -- PAYMENTS -- WHAT WE RECOGNIZE THERE ARE DIFFERENT ING -- INTEREST PAYMENTS OR DIFFERENT INTERESTS THAT LIABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF DEBT -- FOR INSTANCE -- WELL THE THE LA -- STATED THAT -- PAYING OFF THERETIREMENT DEBT OVER A CERTAIN NUMBER OF YEARS -- WITH MORE OF A A LARGER OF PAYMENT WOULD WOULD HELP OUT IN SEVERAL HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS LATER -- IF WE PAY OFF SOME OF THE DEBT SO WE HAVE NOW THAT ARE DUE FOR THE BUDGETARY LOANS THOSE PROGRAMS THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS COULD USE THOSE FUNDS -- TO FOR THEIR THEIR PROGRAMS THINGS THAT HAVEN'T BEEN DONE OVER THE LAST FIFTEEN TWENTY YEARS BECAUSE IT ALONE TO BEEN OUTSTANDING -- TO CERTAIN THINGS THE TO THAT EXPRESS BACKED THEY WERE TRYING TO BALANCE A VERY DELICATE. TO A PRIORITIES AGREEMENTS AMONG OF THE DIFFERENT PARTIES INVOLVED ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. THIS ONE QUICK QUESTION IF THE DECISION IS MADE TO PAY OFF ADDITIONAL DEBT. WHAT WOULD LEGISLATURE NEED TO DO TO DIRECTLY MINISTRATIONS TIMING OF PAYMENTS? I DO DO YOU MEAN TIMING A PAYMENT WITHIN THE FISCAL YEAR CORRECT YEAH. I'M AT SO YEAH THERE IS -- ONE IMPORTANT THING THAT I DIDN'T MENTION IN THE PRESENTATION HERE -- IS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES MAKING MOST OF THESE DEBT REPAYMENTS INCLUDING THE SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS TO THE PENSIONS WHICH WERE AGENDA. VERY EARLY IN THE FISCAL YEAR -- IN JULY -- OF THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY FISCAL YEAR AND THAT'S DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE STATE'S MAJOR REVENUE -- COLLECTION MONTHS ARE DECEMBER JANUARY AND APRIL AND IT REVENUE ESTIMATES ARE INHERENTLY ON CERTAIN WE DON'T HAVE ANY PARTICULAR REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THIS ESTIMATE IS ANY LESS ON CERTAIN THAN ANY OTHER YEAR. BUT BECAUSE REVENUE ESTIMATES ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN WE THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO WAIT UNTIL LATER IN THE FISCAL YEAR ONCE THE STATE HAS ACTUALLY SEEN ITS COLLECTIONS -- TO MAKE THESE PAYMENTS SUCH THAT WE CAN BE ASSURED THAT ON THE REVENUES ARE GOING TO MATERIALIZE THAT WE ANTICIPATE. THANK YOU. NO FURTHER QUESTIONS IN THE COMMISSION WILL MOVE ON TO USER MAY I ANSWER -- TO I MEAN AS FAR AS THE AT THE GENERAL FUND CASH FLOW MANAGEMENT. WE DO. LOOK THAT OVER VERY SERIOUSLY VERY CAREFULLY EACH EACH YEAR. AND WITH OUR BUDGETARY -- DEBTS AND EVERYTHING WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THOSE ARE INCORPORATED IN A TIMELY FASHION IN TERMS OF OUR CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS. CAN THE EARLIER IN THE YEAR THAT MAYBE THE LARGER PAYMENTS GO OUT THE MORE BENEFIT THEY WOULD HAVE FOR THAT YEAR ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE INVESTING MONIES -- SO WE WOULD MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S EQUAL WAITING ON ON SOME OF THESE. HE BACKS AND NOT ALL OF THEM ARE FRONT LOADED BEGINNING OF THE YEAR WE DO RECOGNIZE THAT -- SOME ARE ARE MORE LATER BUT CERTAINLY WE TAKE A VERY -- FISCALLY PRUDENT APPROACH TO EVALUATING THE CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS. AND ONCE WE DO THOSE AGAIN IN JUNE WILL TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION HOW THE FINAL BUDGET ACTION ACTIONS TURNOUT. THANK YOU BUDGET RAINY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. OKAY WELL THE PANEL NUMBER THREE THE AFTERNOON PLEASE START [inaudible] EVERY READY -- SO THE FOURTH PAGE OF YOUR HAND OUT PROVIDES AN OVERVIEW OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED -- DEBT REPAYMENTS RELATED TO RETIREMENT SPECIFICALLY. THERE ARE THREE PROPOSED SUPPLEMENTAL PENSION PAYMENTS BY THE GOVERNOR -- IN THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET. THE FIRST IS A THREE BILLION DOLLAR SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT TO CALPERS FOR STATE EMPLOYEES RETIREMENT LIABILITIES. THE SECOND IS A JUST OVER ONE BILLION DOLLAR A SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT TO CALL STIRS FOR TEACHER PENSION RETIREMENT LIABILITIES RELATED TO THE STATE'S PORTION SPECIFICALLY ABOUT LIABILITY. AND THEN THE THIRD IS A TWO POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT TO CALL STIRS BUT FOR THE DISTRICTS CHAIR OF THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY -- JUST A COUPLE OF NOTES ABOUT THESE -- SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS THE WAY THAT SUPPLEMENTAL PENSION PAYMENTS -- SAVE THE STATE MONEY IS BY ESSENTIALLY EARNING AN INVESTMENT RETURN OVER TIME ASSUME TO BE 7% OVER THE NEXT FEW DECADES -- ON AVERAGE AND THEN AS A RESULT RESULTING IN SLIGHTLY LOWER EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS OVER TIME SO THIS RESULTS GENERALLY AND THAT SAVINGS OVER TIME FOR THE STATE. THAT SAID ON THE STATE SAVINGS ASSOCIATE WITH EACH OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS IS LIKELY TO VERY. OF FOR THE CALPERS -- PAYMENT OF THREE BILLION DOLLARS THE SYSTEM ANTICIPATES THAT THAT WOULD RESULT IN ABOUT SIX POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN SAVINGS OVER THE NEXT FEW DECADES. CAL STAR IS ALSO ANTICIPATE THAT THEIR SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT WOULD RESULT IN SAVINGS OVER THE NEXT FEW DECADES BUT IN CONTRAST TO CALPERS THERE'S AN ESTIMATED 20% CHANCE THAT THE STATE WOULD NOT ACHIEVE SAVINGS OVER THE NEXT FEW DECADES. AND THAT RATHER THOSE SAVINGS WOULD BE ACHIEVED HOSTAGE. TWENTY FORTY SIX SO ARE THE FINAL PAGE OF THE HANDOUT DOES PROVIDE SOME OF OUR COMMENTS RELATED -- TO OF THESE PENSION PAYMENTS AND THEN A COUPLE OF OPTIONS FOR CONSIDERATION. FIRST ON ON THIS CALPERS VERSUS CAL STIRS ISSUE THAT I JUST BROUGHT UP AN IMPORTANT THING TO CONSIDER IS YOUR SORT OF THINKING THROUGH THIS DYNAMIC IS WHAT IS YOUR GOAL FOR THE SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT. ON THE ONE HAND ON THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT HAVE THE GOAL TO ADDRESS UNFUNDED LIABILITY EQUALLY ACROSS THE SYSTEMS OR OR ACROSS BOTH OF THE SYSTEMS. IN WHICH CASE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WOULD MAKE SENSE THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT ALSO HAVE A GOAL TO MAXIMIZE STATE SAVINGS OVER THE NEXT FEW DECADES IN WHICH CASE A PAYMENT TO CALPERS VERSUS CASTERS WOULD BE JUST MORE LIKELY TO ACHIEVE BACK ON I'M. SECOND ON THE CALPERS PAYMENT AND THE WAY THAT IT'S STRUCTURED SPECIFICALLY. SO THE SYSTEM ANTICIPATES THAT THIS WOULD RESULT IN SIX POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN SAVINGS IN TOTAL -- AND THAT THE GENERAL FUND WOULD MAKE A THREE BILLION DOLLARS SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT -- IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THAT SIX POINT THREE BILL BUT THE SIX POINT THREE BILLION IN SAVINGS WOULD ONLY ACCRUE TO THE GENERAL FUND. UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PLAN -- AND THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S NOT ONLY THE GENERAL FUND THAT MAKES PENSION PAYMENTS IT'S ALSO OTHER FUNDS LIKE THE FEDERAL FUNDS -- SPECIAL FUNDS AND THEN TRUST FUNDS LIKE FOR EXAMPLE THE CSU TRUST FUND. SO THE SIX POINT THREE BILLION UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WOULD BE DISTRIBUTED THREE BILLION FOR THE GENERAL FUND AND THREE POINT THREE BILLION APPROXIMATELY FOR THESE OTHER FUNDS. I'M WE JUST HAVE TO GLOSS OVER SOME OF THE TECHNICAL DETAIL HERE BUT WE HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE -- THAT THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT CONSIDER. THAT WOULD ESSENTIALLY MAXIMIZE GENERAL FUND BENEFIT WOULD PROVIDE SLIGHTLY MORE GENERAL FUND BENEFIT. IT WOULD REQUIRE THAT FUNDS THAT BENEFIT FROM THE PLAN ALSO REPAY THE GENERAL FUND FOR THEIR PROPORTIONATE SHARE. IT WOULD REQUEST THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND FEDERAL FUNDS -- REIMBURSE THE STATE FOR THE BENEFIT THAT IT WOULD ARRIVE AS A RESULT OF THE PLAN. AND THEN FINALLY IT WOULD MAXIMIZE BENEFIT TO THE MOTOR VEHICLE ACCOUNT WHICH CURRENTLY BENEFITS BY ONLY ROUGHLY THREE HUNDRED MILLION UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL BUT WOULD BENEFIT BY SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION UNDER OUR OUR OUR ALTERNATIVE. HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS FINANCE. I JUST HAVE A COUPLE COMMENTS SAID I'D LIKE TO MAKE -- I SAID THEY ALEJO'S AB -- AT COMMENTS AND AND RECOMMENDATIONS -- FIRSTLY I I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S PRIMARY GOAL IS TO ADDRESS BOTH SYSTEMS -- UNFUNDED LIABILITY SO THIS THAT REALLY SPEAKS -- TO THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT -- THE STATE DIRECTOR OF THE CASTERS PAYMENT TO CALPERS -- AND ALTHOUGH THERE'S A PROBABILITY THAT THE SAVINGS WILL BE ACHIEVED -- BY THE STATE SOONER FROM THE CALPERS SIDE VERSUS THE CAL STAR SITES BOTH PROPOSALS ARE REALLY AIMED AT MAXIMIZING SAVINGS OVER THE LONG TERM -- IN AND OUT TO THE YELLOW YES POINT ABOUT -- DIRECTING THE AND RECOMMENDATION DIRECTING THE CALPERS THREE BILLION DOLLARS TO THE FIVE STATE PLANS BASED ON THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY OF EACH OF THOSE PLANS -- AND REQUIRE THE REPAYMENT FROM THE NON GENERAL FUND FUNDS -- AGAIN -- OUR PROPOSAL IS TO AIMS AIMS TO ACHIEVE THE SAVINGS IN THE LONG RUN AND SPREAD THE BENEFITS -- MORE ACT EQUITABLY -- WHILE THE LA THOSE ALTERNATE RECOMMENDATION WOULD INCREASE GENERAL FUNDS APPROPRIATE SHARE THE BENEFIT RESULTING FROM THE PROPOSED PAYMENT WE NOTE THAT THE CURRENT PROPOSAL ALREADY -- DEDICATES THE MAJORITY OF THE BENEFIT TO THE GENERAL FUND -- ADDITIONALLY WE WOULD NOTE THAT THE YELLOW ALEJO'S RECOMMENDATION WOULD REQUIRE THAT WE EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY OF THOSE OTHER FUNDS TO MAKE REPAYMENTS -- AND AS YOU MAY REMEMBER -- IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN SB STE WHICH MADE THE US SIX BILLION DOLLAR SUPPLEMENTAL PENSION PAYMENT. TO CALPERS AND WAS STRUCTURED IN SUCH A WAY THAT WE HAVE FOR OTHER FUNDS REPAYING THOSE LOANS AS WELL AS A GENERAL FUND. AND THEREFORE -- THE ADDITIONAL LOAN THAT WE WOULD BE CREATING THROUGH THIS PROPOSAL. WOULD -- PUT ADDITIONAL BURDENS ON THESE OTHER FUNDS THAT SHOULD BE GREATLY CONSIDERED. I'M ALSO UNLIKE THE SPD FOR SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT WHICH SAW AN ALMOST IMMEDIATE REDUCTION TO RETIREMENT CONTRIBUTIONS THE CARD PROPOSAL IS EXPECTED TO YIELD SAVINGS OVER THE LONG TERM. WHICH MEANS IT COULD BE MORE DIFFICULT FOR THESE FUNDS TO ABSORB ANOTHER -- ANOTHER LONG. AGAIN BACK TO MY POINT. THANK YOU ARE PRISONERS FROM CALPERS AND CAL STIRS. OKAY EVERYWHERE SOARING IN OREGON. DOCTORAL OFFICE A CALPERS -- THE CALPERS ACTUAL OFFICE WAS ASKED TO DETERMINE THE POTENTIAL SAVINGS TO THE STATE PLANS OF MAKING IS ADDITIONAL DISCRETIONARY PAYMENTS TOTALING THREE BILLION DOLLARS. IN THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN FISCAL YEAR -- THE SAVINGS RESULT DUE TO THE REDUCED INTEREST BEING PAID ON THE LOWER UNFUNDED LIABILITY BALANCES. OUR CALCULATIONS WERE DONE ON BOTH THE DETERMINISTIC BASIS. WHICH ASSUMES THAT THE FUND WOULD EARN SOME PERCENT EACH AND EVERY YEAR. AND ON US TO CASTING SIMULATION BASIS WITH RANDOMIZE RETURNS. BASED ON OUR CAPITAL MARKET ASSUMPTIONS WHICH TO ICAL INVESTMENT VOLATILITY. WITH RESULTS BROKEN DOWN BY PERCENT OFFER THE THOUSAND SIMULATIONS. I ONE ADDITIONAL BENEFIT THAT WE DO -- ONE ADDRESS HERE TOO IS THAT WITH CURRENT BENEFIT PAYMENTS -- EXCEEDING ANNUAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE SYSTEM. THERE IS A RISK OF THE SYSTEM OF BEING FORCED TO SELL PRODUCTIVE ASSETS. AT AN INOPPORTUNE TIME. AN ADDITIONAL BENEFIT TO THE SYSTEM WOULD BE TO A SLIGHTLY ENHANCE RETURN. AS THE THREE BILLION DOLLAR PAYMENT WOULD ASSIST OUR INVESTMENT OFFICE IN MANAGING THEIR LIQUIDITY CONCERNS. AND WE'RE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. CUSTOMERS HI I'M DAVID I'M OVER FROM CAL STIRS ADJUSTER WANTED TO POINT TO YOU YOU STILL HAVE RECEIVERS SOME HAND OUT WITH HIM JUST GOING TO REFER TO THEM BRIEFLY. AND MOSTLY WHAT I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT THIS AFTERNOON IS TO AGAIN GO BACK TO THE CAN REFER BACK TO THE COMMENT THAT MAYBE. IT'S MORE LIKELY THAT SAVINGS COULD BE ACHIEVED BY GIVING THE MONEY TO CALPERS AND SORT OF CALLOUS TO RISO HISTORICALLY CALLOUSED SERVERS A COUNTRY TO MOST ORDER PUBLIC RETIREMENT SYSTEMS IN CALIFORNIA. COSTUMES WAS NEVER THE CASTERS BOARD WAS NEVER ABLE TO ADJUST. CONTRIBUTION RATES IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE FOR FUNDING. THIS LED TO THE SITUATION WE'RE IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT TWO THOUSAND AND NINE FOLLOWING THE FINANCIAL CRISIS. THAT COUNTS TO WAS WAS SCHEDULED TO ACTUALLY. THAT SITUATION LED TO THE PASSAGE OF WHAT IS CALLED A D. CASTERS FUNDING PLAN THROUGH ASSEMBLY BILL FOURTEEN SIXTY NINE AND TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN AND THROUGH THAT PROCESS. ALL OF CALISTO STAKEHOLDERS ALL AGREED TO CHIP IN MORE AND ALL CONTRIBUTE TO WORD. OF MORE TOWARD CASTERS TO SOLVE THE FUNDING SITUATION. OUR MEMBERS AGREED TO PAY MORE THE STATE AGREED TO PAY MORE AND THE EMPLOYERS ALSO AGREED TO PAY MORE. AND WHAT ALSO CAME OUT OF THIS WHICH WAS KEY IS OUR BOARD WAS GRANTED FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER THE AUTHORITY TO ACTUALLY SET CONTRIBUTION RATES. TO ENSURE FULL FUNDING LONG TERM BUT THIS AUTHORITY WAS LIMITED AND THE MAIN POINT I WANT TO MAKE YOUR IT'S THIS LIMITED AUTHORITY THAT. IS LEADING TO THE SITUATION THAT IF WE DO RECEIVE MONEY FOR THE STATE TO REDUCE THEIR SHARE OF THE COST OF UNFUNDED LIABILITY. SPECIAL OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS THE STATE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE SAVINGS EVERY YEAR OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS BUT THE SAVINGS AS A THE REPRESENTED FROM FINANCE QUOTED. WILL ALWAYS BE OF ACHIEVE OVER THE LONG TERM BUT THEY MAY NOT BE ACHIEVED EVERY YEAR OVER TO SHORTEN WHAT WE'VE BEEN TELLING FOLKS IS. BECAUSE OF OUR BOARD LIMITED ABILITY TO SET CONTRIBUTION RATE. IT IS UNCERTAIN FOR US WHEN THE SAVINGS WILL BE ACHIEVED BUT THERE WILL ALWAYS BE ACHIEVED OVER THE LONG TERM. SO WE HAVE. FOR MARVIN WE ARE -- WE ARE VERY WE WE LOVE THE IDEA OF RECEIVING MORE MONEY FROM THE STATE TO HELP BOTH EMPLOYERS AND THE STATE INTO WHICH WAS UNFUNDED LIABILITY. AND JUST TO POINT OUT TO YOU IN CASE YOU'RE INTERESTED WE HAVE A SHEET HERE THAT HAS A LITTLE PIGGY BANK AND A PIE CHART JUST IN CASE YOU ARE INTERESTED. AS OF THE MOST RECENT EVALUATION WHERE WE RELEASE INFORMATION CAL STARS AS AN UNFUNDED LIABILITY OF ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS. OF WHICH SEVENTY ONE DOLLAR SEVEN ONE MILLION ROUGHLY IS DISH THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE EMPLOYERS. AND THIRTY FIVE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE STATE SAID THE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS TO APPLY. ABOUT ONE POINT ONE BILLION TO REDUCE THE THIRTY FIVE AND TWO POINT THREE BILLION TO REDUCE. TO SEVENTY ONE AND WITH THIS I WOULD BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU. THE CALPERS UP LITTLE PENSION PAYMENT PROPOSAL WOULD BENEFIT ALL CALPERS MEMBERS. SO WOULD ALSO BENEFIT CSU EMPLOYEES. I CAN TAKE THAT QUESTION -- SERVICIOS USE TREATED -- SIMILAR TO OTHER STATE DEPARTMENTS THAT THE STATE PROVIDES -- GENERAL FUND FOR OCCUPATION SO CS USE EMPLOYEES ARE ACTUALLY MEMBERS OF THREE STATE PLANS THE STATE MISCELLANEOUS STATE SAFETY AND STATE PEACE OFFICERS. I'M IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THE SHARE OF THE GENERAL FUND CONTRIBUTIONS OF TOTAL CONTRIBUTIONS MADE TO CALPERS -- OR WILL BE MAKING TO CALPERS ON BEHALF OF THE CSU IS AN ESTIMATED 19% SO ASSUMING THAT -- EIGHT A 20% OF THOUGHT OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL PENSION PAYMENT SAVINGS ON WHICH IS WE PROJECT AT SEVEN POINT TWO BILLION -- THE CS USE PROPORTIONATE SHARE WOULD BE ABOUT ONE POINT FOUR BILLION OVER THE NEXT THREE DECADES. THANK YOU FOR CHARACTERS. ADMINISTRATIONS CAL STIRS PROPOSALS PROVIDE COMPARABLE FUNDING FOR THE CALPERS SCHOOL CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEE POOL. AND ALSO TAKE THAT QUESTION -- SO THE ADDITIONAL PAYMENT TO CAL PURSES. AT REALLY INTENDED TO PAY DOWN THE STATE'S RETIREMENT LIABILITIES WHICH YOU KNOW WILL RESULT IN A SAVINGS TO THE STATE -- OVER THE NEXT THREE DECADES -- FOR COMPARISON THE CAL SERVICES SIDE DEFINED BENEFIT PROGRAM HAS A SIXTY TWO POINT 6% FUNDED STATUS AND THE SEVENTY ONE POINT FOUR BILLION UNFUNDED LIABILITY WHERE AS THE SCHOOLS -- AT SCHOOL PLAN IS IS AT SEVENTY TWO POINT 1% FUNDED WITH IT TWENTY THREE POINT SIX MILLION UNFUNDED LIABILITY. OKAY THIS ONE MORE QUESTION SO SORE THE TRADE OFF TO CONSIDER. BETWEEN PROVIDING NEAR TERM. AND LONGER TERM BUDGETARY RELIEF FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS. SO THIS IS THE STATE RECOGNIZES THE COST PRESSURES THAT ARE FACING SCHOOLS AND THE PAYMENT THAT -- WILL BE MADE TO SUPPLANT AT SCHOOL EMPLOYER SHARE -- ADDRESSES -- ONE OF THOSE LONG TERM COST PRESSURE WITHOUT CREATING AN ON GOING -- COSTS TO THE STATE -- WE ARE HOPING. TO PROVIDE THIS THIS FUNDING -- TO ALLOW SCHOOLS TO HAVE SOME TIME TO BETTER PLAN FOR THE INCREASES IN RETIREMENT CONTRIBUTIONS -- WE THINK THAT WAITING TO PROVIDE THE RELIEF THAT WOULD PUT MORE PRESSURE UP MORE MORE COST PRESSURE ON THE SCHOOLS IN THE IMMEDIATE TERM -- AND ALSO WE WANT TO NOTE THAT THE LONGER WE WAIT TO ALLOCATE THE SUPPLANTING PAYMENTS -- MORE OF THE THREE BILLION WILL LIKELY BE NEEDED TO EFFECTUATE THE SAME REDUCTION THAT WE'RE HOPING TO ACHIEVE OUR WITH OUR PROPOSAL. HI THIS IS BECAUSE THE PAYROLL -- CONTINUES TO INCREASE -- OVER THE YEARS AND SO CONSEQUENTLY THE THE THREE BILLION THAT WERE PROPOSING. TO TO MAKE A PAYMENT -- FOR CAN BE. A MORE OF IT WOULD BE DEDICATED TO WORDS -- PAYING DOWN THE WE'RE HOPING TO TO ACHIEVE. THANK YOU ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. GOOGLE IN AN OPEN A PUBLIC COMMENT. THOSE WISHING TO SPEAK ON THIS ITEM. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS. GEN I SUPPRESS IT WITH THE COMPANY SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION YOU'VE RAISED THE EXACT QUESTION THAT. WE ARE HERE TO TRY TO RESPOND -- AS YOU COULD IMAGINE FOR US WE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND PUBLIC SCHOOL. CLASSIFY STAFF IN THE SCHOOL POOL IN A PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES. AND THE PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU FROM THE ADMINISTRATION WE TAKE OUR GREAT IDEAS BECAUSE YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO DO WHAT YOU CAN TO HELP. REDUCE THE BURDEN IN THIS OP SCHOOL DISTRICT. BUT THEY DID LEAVE OUT THE SCHOOL POOL FOR CLASSIFY STAFF. AND WE HAD WOULD QUIT CALPERS TO KIND OF COME UP WITH SOME OF THESE COMPANIES. OUR INITIAL INFORMATION FROM SCOTT TORRES. THE EQUIVALENT TO WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING VOICE THIS DOES PROGRAM FOR TEACHERS. IS THREE BILLION DOLLAR WITH SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION TO BUY DOWN ESSENTIALLY 1% FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS. THE EQUIPMENT NUMBER IS FOUR TO CLASSIFY STAFF WOULD BE ONE POINT ONE FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. AND ABOUT A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE PER YEAR FOR THREE FIFTY FOR TWO YEARS. THOSE ARE THE NUMBERS COM COMING FROM CALPERS. AND I WOULD POINT OUT THAT TWO MORE ISSUES JUST TO BE BRIEF. ONE IS THAT HISTORICALLY WHEN THE RATES WERE DROPPING THE SCHOOL SYSTEM WAS BUILT ON A REVENUE LIMITS SYSTEM IN WHICH ONE REVENUES OF FOUR POSE PENSION WENT DOWN. THE STATE WAS ABLE TO RECAPTURE THE SAVINGS. AND THEN WHEN HE WENT UP SHE WAS SUPPOSED. TO DO THAT BUT ONE THAT SCHOOL SYSTEM WENT TO ALL THE HAVE HISTORICAL KIND OF PROMISE. HIS JIM JUST EMBEDDED NOW SO IT'S GONE IN TERMS OF HOW WOULD YOU ADDRESS AND I THINK NO ONE REALLY TOP WE WERE GONNA GO PAST THIRTEEN POINT -- TO DUSTIN MAGIC. NUMBER THAT WAS SET BACK IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO THIRTEEN POINT 002% THAT WE WOULD HAVE THIS KIND OF BACK AND FORTH TO STATE WHAT BACK FEEL. OF COURSE NOW WE'RE AT 18% IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN WE'RE GOING ALL THE WAY UP TO TWENTY FIVE POINT 7%. IN TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE THAT'S ONE REASON WE ARE FACING. JUST AS MUCH AND MORE PRESSURE. SECOND I SHARE WITH YOU THE HISTORICAL THE SUNLIGHT LCF DOES NOT CAPTURE IT IS THE FUNDING FOR SCHOOLS NO LONGER CAPTURES THIS AND WE WOULD. ASK FOR YOU HELP TO DO THIS. AND THIRD. THERE'S A NEGATIVE IMPACT TO MY MEMBERS IN PARTICULAR BECAUSE NOW. YOU ARE FACING RISING COSTS FOR EVERY NEW HIRE OF A CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEE YOU MIGHT BE SLIGHTLY READ. RELUCTANT BECAUSE EUROPE ON A FACE RISING COSTS AND SO WE THINK YOU KNOW FOR AS LITTLE AS A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. YOU COULD DO THE SAME THING FOR A MEMBERS ALSO AND WE WOULD ASK FOR YOUR INTERESTS AND YOUR YOUR REVIEW OF THIS PROPOSAL WE'RE ENGAGING ADMINISTRATION WERE ASKING WHY TO SCHOOL POOL WAS NOT ADDRESS. ANYTHING SOME OF THAT EARLY CONVERSATION LOOKS POSIT MORE AS WE SEE MORE THE REVENUES BUT WE WOULD URGE YOU TO SET THE SOME ON A SITE TO HELP. TO HARD WORKING CLASSIFIED SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ALSO THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON JENNIFER BAKER WITH THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION -- APPRECIATE THE THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE WITH CSEA HOW WHAT I DIDN'T WANT TO KNOW IS WE ABSOLUTELY SUPPORT AND APPRECIATE -- THE GOVERNOR'S CREATIVITY IN THE PROPOSAL HE THAT HE'S PURPORT CALC STIRS WE DO SUPPORT A AND WE THINK IT THAT IT'S VERY FISCALLY PRUDENT WE WE DISAGREE WITH THE LA -- WHILE WE APPRECIATE NUMBER IN THE COMMENTS HOW WE DISAGREED THAT WE SHOULD WAIT TO ADDITIONALLY AND PROVIDE THE SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION FOR A SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND WE BELIEVE THAT SOMETHING THAT'S NEEDED NOW -- I DO WANT TO NOTE -- BECAUSE IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'S PER THAT -- THE PROPOSAL BUT I KNOW CAL STIRS WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO HAVE INCREASED HEART RATE SETTING AUTHORITY AT THE TEACHERS RETIREMENT BOARD LEVEL AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT STAKEHOLDERS WERE ADAMANTLY OPPOSED TO WHAT WE DO APPRECIATE THE DILEMMA THAT IT PUT TO TEACHERS RETIREMENT BOARD IN. IT DOES HAVE AN IMPACT ON PROP NINETY EIGHT AND SINCE IT'S THE LEGISLATURE'S PURVIEW TO SET EDUCATION FUNDING AND HAVE A DISCUSSION OVER THE RIGHT WAY TO MAKE SURE WE'RE FINDING IN OUR SCHOOLS WE DON'T BELIEVE IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR THE CHARACTERS BOARD TO INCREASE. THE RATE SETTING AUTHORITY THAT THEY HAVE -- THAT WAS ADDED INTO A. B. FORTY OUR THOUGHTS ABOUT CHANGING THAT BECAUSE IT DOES HAVE AN IMPACT ON EDUCATION AND THAT BOARD -- WHILE THEY DO VERY MUCH CARE ABOUT TEACHERS RETIREMENT DON'T UNDERSTAND THE COMPLEXITIES OF EDUCATION FUNDING AND AS YOU KNOW MANY THESE PENSION ISSUES TO HAVE AN IMPACT ON EDUCATION FUNDING AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE LEGISLATURE RETAINS ITS PURVIEW SO. WE WOULD ENCOURAGE CONVERSATION ABOUT TRYING TO DO ANYTHING THAT WE CAN TO HELP CAL STIRS TO BE IN A BETTER FIDUCIARY -- LEVEL -- AND WE WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO AT MOVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS FORWARD AND WE'RE HAPPY TO HELP OUT IN ANY WAY WE CAN THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THIS BRINGS OUR HEARING TO INCLUDING ON THANK OUR WITNESSES AND OUR SPEAKERS AND HAVE A GREAT DAY
