00:25:38.069 --> 00:25:39.671
TREMENDOUS UNDERTAKING FOR OUR

00:25:39.738 --> 00:25:41.973
DEPARTMENT. FOR THE FIRST TIME

00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:43.241
IN OUR SEVENTY THREE YEAR

00:25:43.308 --> 00:25:45.143
HISTORY CALVET HAS FULLY

00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:46.478
REASSESSED THE VETERANS HOME

00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:51.182
PROPERTIES. ARE PROGRAMS OF

00:25:51.249 --> 00:25:53.385
CARE AND THE HEALTH CARE NEEDS

00:25:53.451 --> 00:25:55.553
OF ALL OF OUR RESIDENTS. CALVET

00:25:55.620 --> 00:25:58.123
STAFF COMBINED. A COMB THROUGH

00:25:58.189 --> 00:26:00.292
THOUSANDS OF RECORDS TO CAPTURE

00:26:00.358 --> 00:26:01.860
DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGES AMONG OUR

00:26:01.927 --> 00:26:03.762
RESIDENTS AND THEM AMONG THE

00:26:03.828 --> 00:26:06.097
VETERAN COMMUNITY AT LARGE. WE

00:26:06.164 --> 00:26:07.999
MET WITH DOZENS OF VETERANS

00:26:08.066 --> 00:26:09.834
SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS ELECTED

00:26:09.901 --> 00:26:12.037

COUNCILS AND OTHER RESIDENTS AT

00:26:15.907 --> 00:26:17.943
EVERY HOME. TO ENSURE THAT WE

00:26:18.009 --> 00:26:20.345
HAVE A VARIETY OF PERSPECTIVES

00:26:20.412 --> 00:26:22.714
TO BOLSTER OUR RECOMMENDATIONS.

00:26:22.781 --> 00:26:24.149
SALIM GRATEFUL FOR THE MANY

00:26:24.215 --> 00:26:25.850
STAKEHOLDERS WHO OFFERED THEIR

00:26:25.917 --> 00:26:27.986
VALUABLE TIME TO CONTRIBUTE TO

00:26:28.053 --> 00:26:30.822
THE PROJECT. THE RESULT OF

00:26:30.889 --> 00:26:36.294
WHICH IS THIS. THE MASTER PLAN

DAVID TWENTY TWENTY BUT YOU

00:26:38.063 --> 00:26:39.564
KNOW THEY'LL BE AN UPDATE EVERY

00:26:39.631 --> 00:26:41.599
FIVE YEARS IN PERPETUITY I'M

00:26:41.666 --> 00:26:43.735
VERY PROUD OF THIS DOCUMENT

00:26:43.802 --> 00:26:45.103
WHAT OUR TEAM HAS BEEN ABLE TO

00:26:45.170 --> 00:26:48.173
ACCOMPLISH WITH THE MASTER PLAN

00:26:48.239 --> 00:26:49.040
THE DEPTH AND QUALITY OF THE

00:26:49.107 --> 00:26:50.976
RESEARCH PAINTS A COMPELLING

00:26:51.042 --> 00:26:52.911
PORTRAIT OF TODAY'S AND

00:26:52.978 --> 00:26:54.879
TOMORROW'S VETERANS AND WILL

00:26:54.946 --> 00:26:58.049
HELP US UNDERSTAND HOW TO MEET

00:26:58.116 --> 00:26:59.918
FUTURE VETERANS NEEDS. HOWEVER

00:26:59.985 --> 00:27:01.086
I SHOULD MENTION THAT THESE

00:27:01.152 --> 00:27:03.355
RECOMMENDATIONS ARE BASED ON

00:27:03.421 --> 00:27:05.357
OUR PREDICTIONS OF THE FUTURE

00:27:05.423 --> 00:27:07.792
INCLUDING THE ASSUMPTION OF NO

00:27:07.859 --> 00:27:09.461
LARGE INCREASE IN THE VETERAN

00:27:09.527 --> 00:27:11.997
POPULATION AS WE HAVE LEARNED

00:27:12.063 --> 00:27:14.299
OVER THE PAST CENTURY EVERY NEW

00:27:14.366 --> 00:27:17.035
WAR CREATES NEW VETERANS THAT

00:27:17.102 --> 00:27:19.037
HAS ITS OWN UNIQUE IMPACT ON

00:27:19.104 --> 00:27:21.139
THE VETERAN COMMUNITY FIVE MAY

00:27:21.206 --> 00:27:22.741
PUT IT MORE BLUNTLY IF THE

00:27:22.807 --> 00:27:24.376
UNITED STATES ENGAGES IN ANY

00:27:24.442 --> 00:27:26.911
NEW MAJOR CONFLICTS OR WARS

00:27:26.978 --> 00:27:29.848
SOME OR ALL OF OUR FINDINGS MAY

00:27:29.914 --> 00:27:32.283
NEED RADICAL ECONSIDERATION.

00:27:32.350 --> 00:27:34.285
WITHOUT CABBIE OUT MIND LET ME

00:27:34.352 --> 00:27:36.988
PROCEED THE MASTER PLAN SERVES

00:27:37.055 --> 00:27:39.524
TWO PRIMARY FUNCTIONS FIRST IT

00:27:39.591 --> 00:27:41.793
IS A NEEDS ASSESSMENT THAT

00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:43.294
EXAMINES TRENDS IN THE VETERANS

00:27:43.361 --> 00:27:45.230
COMMUNITY INCLUDING HOW MANY

00:27:45.296 --> 00:27:46.965
VETERANS LIVING CALIFORNIA

00:27:47.032 --> 00:27:49.467
WHERE THEY LIVE AND HOW THEIR

00:27:49.534 --> 00:27:51.603
CARE NEEDS ARE CHANGING. THIS

00:27:51.669 --> 00:27:53.905
NEEDS ASSESSMENT ALSO EVALUATES

00:27:53.972 --> 00:27:55.707
THE VETERANS HOMES THEMSELVES

00:27:55.774 --> 00:27:57.909
BY REVIEWING THE STRENGTHS AND

00:27:57.976 --> 00:27:59.744
LIMITATIONS AT EACH CAMPUS.

00:27:59.811 --> 00:28:02.047
SECONDLY THE MASTER PLAN IS A

00:28:02.113 --> 00:28:03.782
ROADMAP TO GUIDE DISCUSSIONS

00:28:03.848 --> 00:28:05.917
ABOUT LONG TERM CAN'T A LONG

00:28:05.984 --> 00:28:08.319
TERM PLANNING. INCLUDED IN THE

00:28:08.386 --> 00:28:09.821
PLAN ARE TWENTY SEVEN

00:28:09.888 --> 00:28:11.856
RECOMMENDATIONS ON A WIDE RANGE

00:28:11.923 --> 00:28:13.758
OF SUBJECTS THAT WE ARE

00:28:13.825 --> 00:28:15.393
CONFIDENT WILL HELP ENSURE ON

00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:17.328
GOING SUCCESS OF ALL EIGHT OF

00:28:17.395 --> 00:28:19.164
OUR HOMES. BUT BEFORE I DISCUSS

00:28:19.230 --> 00:28:20.532
ANY OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS

00:28:20.598 --> 00:28:23.034
SINCE BUT IN PARTICULAR I WANT

00:28:23.101 --> 00:28:24.135
TO TALK ABOUT THE VETERAN

00:28:24.202 --> 00:28:26.071
POPULATION THAT WE HAVE THE

00:28:26.137 --> 00:28:29.407
HONOR TO SERVE. FOR PERHAPS

00:28:29.474 --> 00:28:31.376
FORTY YEARS IT'S WORLD WAR TWO

00:28:31.443 --> 00:28:32.677
VETERANS THAT HAVE BEEN THE

00:28:32.744 --> 00:28:34.245
PRIMARY BENEFICIARIES OF THE

00:28:34.312 --> 00:28:36.714
VETERAN HOME SYSTEM. SEVEN OF

00:28:36.781 --> 00:28:38.083
OUR EIGHT HOMES WERE

00:28:38.149 --> 00:28:39.717
SPECIFICALLY BUILT TO SERVE

00:28:39.784 --> 00:28:40.819
WORLD WAR TWO AND KOREA WAR

00:28:40.885 --> 00:28:43.455
VETERANS. HOWEVER WE'RE LOSING

00:28:43.521 --> 00:28:45.623
THOSE VETERANS AT A RAPID RATE.

00:28:45.690 --> 00:28:46.524
AND THIS REPRESENTS A

00:28:46.591 --> 00:28:48.693
TREMENDOUS LOSS FOR OUR STATE

00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:51.162
IN MANY WAYS BECAUSE CALIFORNIA

00:28:51.229 --> 00:28:53.431
BECAME WHAT IT IS TODAY BECAUSE

00:28:53.498 --> 00:28:55.967
OF THE GREAT INFLUX OF VETERANS

00:28:56.034 --> 00:28:57.635
RETURNING FROM WORLD WAR TWO.

00:28:57.702 --> 00:28:59.704
AND WITH THIS SAD LOSS

00:28:59.771 --> 00:29:01.439
CALIFORNIA'S VETERAN POPULATION

00:29:01.506 --> 00:29:03.875
HAS ALREADY DECREASED BY

00:29:03.942 --> 00:29:05.944
SEVERAL HUNDRED THOUSAND OVER

00:29:06.010 --> 00:29:08.113
THE PAST DECADE. AND TO MAKE

00:29:08.179 --> 00:29:09.614
THAT VISUAL IF YOU WOULD LOOK

00:29:09.681 --> 00:29:12.250
AT TABLE ONE IN THE HAND THAT

00:29:12.317 --> 00:29:16.421
WE PROVIDED YOU. IT'S THE

00:29:16.488 --> 00:29:18.156
DECREASING VETERAN POPULATION

00:29:18.223 --> 00:29:20.258
PROJECTED OUT TO TWO THOUSAND

00:29:20.325 --> 00:29:21.793
FORTY FIVE. IF YOU WANT TO KNOW

00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:23.161
THE SOURCES OF ALL THIS

00:29:23.228 --> 00:29:25.063
INFORMATION WE CAN GIVE YOU.

00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:27.465
TONS OF FOOTNOTES YOU'LL NOTICE

00:29:27.532 --> 00:29:30.668
THAT FIVE YEARS AGO- WHEN I

00:29:30.735 --> 00:29:31.636
STARTED WE WERE AT ONE POINT

00:29:31.703 --> 00:29:35.106
EIGHT. MILLION VETERANSTODAY

00:29:35.173 --> 00:29:38.943
WE ARE AT ONE POINT SIX MILLION

00:29:39.010 --> 00:29:39.577
AND THAT NUMBER IS PROJECTED TO

00:29:39.644 --> 00:29:43.681
GO DOWN. AS OF JANUARY FIRST OF

00:29:43.748 --> 00:29:45.550
THIS YEAR I'M SAID TO SAY THE

00:29:45.617 --> 00:29:46.651
UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF

00:29:46.718 --> 00:29:49.320
VETERANS AFFAIRS PROJECTS THAT

00:29:49.387 --> 00:29:51.923
TEXAS NOT CALIFORNIA IS NOW THE

00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:53.458
STATE WITH THE LARGEST VETERAN

00:29:53.525 --> 00:29:55.093
POPULATION. THIS TREND WILL

00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:57.095
CONTINUE WELL INTO THE FUTURE

00:29:57.162 --> 00:29:58.830
AND BY THE OR FORTY FORTY THE

00:29:58.897 --> 00:30:01.766
VA PROJECTS A 40% DECLINE IN

00:30:01.833 --> 00:30:03.902
OUR VETERAN POPULATION. THIS

00:30:03.968 --> 00:30:05.837
REDUCTION IS SIGNIFICANT THERE

00:30:05.904 --> 00:30:07.972
WILL BE FAR FEWER VETERANS IN

00:30:08.039 --> 00:30:09.807
TEN TO TWENTY YEARS. BUT THIS

00:30:09.874 --> 00:30:11.943
DECREASEDOES NOT TRANSLATE

00:30:12.010 --> 00:30:14.712
INTO A PROPORTIONAL DECLINE IN

00:30:14.779 --> 00:30:16.748
THE CARE NEEDS OF VETERANS.

00:30:16.814 --> 00:30:18.349
WITH A LOSS OF WORLD WAR TWO

00:30:18.416 --> 00:30:20.018
AND KOREA WAR VETERANS COMES A

00:30:20.084 --> 00:30:22.353
GENERATIONAL SHIFT. WHICH YOU

00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:24.789
MIGHT SEE MORE EASILY IN TABLE

00:30:24.856 --> 00:30:28.626
TWO OF THE HAND OUT. TODAY THE

00:30:28.693 --> 00:30:30.828
HOMES PRIMARILY SERVE VIETNAM

00:30:30.895 --> 00:30:33.064
WAR VETERANS WITH GULF WAR

00:30:33.131 --> 00:30:34.866
VETERANS LOOMING ON THE NEAR

00:30:34.933 --> 00:30:37.936
HORIZON WE BELIEVE THAT VIETNAM

00:30:38.002 --> 00:30:39.470
AND GULF WAR VETERANS ARE FAR

00:30:39.537 --> 00:30:41.839
MORE LIKELY TO NEED LONG TERM

00:30:41.906 --> 00:30:44.642
CARE. AND TO ME THAT AT YOUNGER

00:30:44.709 --> 00:30:47.178
AGES. COMPARED TO WORLD WAR TWO

00:30:47.245 --> 00:30:49.814
VETERANS. VETERANS FROM IRAQ

00:30:49.881 --> 00:30:51.783
AND AFGHANISTAN ARE THREE TIMES

00:30:51.849 --> 00:30:53.985
MORE LIKELY TO RECEIVE A HIGH

00:30:54.052 --> 00:30:57.355
DISABILITY RATING FROM THE VA

00:30:57.422 --> 00:30:59.224
DEFINED AS GREATER THAN 70%

00:30:59.290 --> 00:31:00.792
VIETNAM AND GULF WAR VETERANS

00:31:00.858 --> 00:31:01.993
ARE MORE LIKELY THAN THEIR

00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:04.529
PREDECESSORS TO HAVE PTSD

00:31:04.596 --> 00:31:06.798
SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS AND

00:31:06.864 --> 00:31:08.700
MANY OTHER PHYSICAL AND

00:31:08.766 --> 00:31:10.868
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITIONS.

00:31:10.935 --> 00:31:12.770
OF ALL THE VETERANS RECEIVING

00:31:12.837 --> 00:31:15.640
IN HOME CARE 20% OF THEM SERVED

00:31:15.707 --> 00:31:18.076
AFTER NINE ELEVEN DESPITE BEING

00:31:18.142 --> 00:31:19.978
RELATIVELY YOUNG FOR DAILY

00:31:20.044 --> 00:31:22.780
CARE. THEIR CARE NEEDS ARE FAR

00:31:22.847 --> 00:31:24.916
MORE CUTE THAN THOSE OF

00:31:24.983 --> 00:31:26.351
VETERANS OF PRIOR JIM

00:31:26.417 --> 00:31:28.987
GENERATIONS. YOU CAN SEE THAT

00:31:29.053 --> 00:31:31.389
ON TABLE THREE WHERE THE GREEN

00:31:31.456 --> 00:31:32.991
LINE IS THE DECREASING

00:31:33.057 --> 00:31:33.992
POPULATION OF VETERANS IN

00:31:34.058 --> 00:31:37.228
CALIFORNIA. WHILE THE BLUE LINE

00:31:37.295 --> 00:31:39.631
IS THE INCREASING DISABILITY

00:31:39.697 --> 00:31:45.737
AMONG CALIFORNIA VETERANS. MUCH

00:31:45.803 --> 00:31:47.505
OF THIS GENERATIONAL SHIFT CAN

00:31:47.572 --> 00:31:49.540
LIKELY BE TRACED BACK TO THE

00:31:49.607 --> 00:31:51.442
CHARACTERISTIC OF THE WARS THAT

00:31:51.509 --> 00:31:53.811
WE FIGHT THEMSELVES AS A

00:31:53.878 --> 00:31:54.979
RETIRED COLONEL OF THE ARMY

00:31:55.046 --> 00:31:56.481
MEDICAL CORPS WITH MULTIPLE

00:31:56.547 --> 00:31:58.283
DEPLOYMENTS I CAN TELL YOU

00:31:58.349 --> 00:31:59.584
FIRST HAND THAT OVER THE LAST

00:31:59.651 --> 00:32:01.953
CENTURY THE LETHALITY OF THE

00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:04.022
BATTLE FIELD HAS CHANGED AS THE

00:32:04.088 --> 00:32:05.590
NATURE OF MODERN COMBAT HAS

00:32:05.657 --> 00:32:07.292
CHANGED. VETERANS ARE MORE

00:32:07.358 --> 00:32:08.926
LIKELY TO BE DEPLOYED MULTIPLE

00:32:08.993 --> 00:32:11.062
TIMES ANDTO BE EXPOSED

00:32:11.129 --> 00:32:12.597
EVERYWHERE TO BALLISTIC

00:32:12.664 --> 00:32:15.066
INJURIES SEEING THAT THERE IS

00:32:15.133 --> 00:32:16.434
NO LONGER A DISTINCTION BETWEEN

00:32:16.501 --> 00:32:19.337
WAR ZONES AND SAFE ZONES FOR

00:32:19.404 --> 00:32:21.172
THESE REASONS AMONG OTHERS

00:32:21.239 --> 00:32:23.241
MODERN SERVICE MEMBERS ARE MORE

00:32:23.308 --> 00:32:25.243
LIKELY THAN THEIR PREDECESSORS

00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:27.045
TO RETURN HOME WTH PHYSICAL

00:32:27.111 --> 00:32:29.447
AND MENTAL HEALTH LIMITATIONS.

00:32:29.514 --> 00:32:31.316
IN DEVELOPING MASTER PLAN WE

00:32:31.382 --> 00:32:32.717
NOT ONLY LOOKED AT THE VETERANS

00:32:32.784 --> 00:32:34.152
WE SERVE WE ALSO TURNED OUR

00:32:34.218 --> 00:32:36.220
ATTENTION INWARD TO THE

00:32:36.287 --> 00:32:37.989
VETERANS HOMES THAT WE OPERATE.

00:32:38.056 --> 00:32:40.191
I AM PROUD OF THE FIVE STAR

00:32:40.258 --> 00:32:42.427
CARE WE PROVIDE TO OUR TWO

00:32:42.493 --> 00:32:44.595
THOUSAND PLUS RESIDENTS. IT'S

00:32:44.662 --> 00:32:46.197
ALSO GRATIFYING THAT MORE THAN

00:32:46.264 --> 00:32:48.266
90% OF OUR HOME RESIDENTS HAVE

00:32:48.333 --> 00:32:50.034
A POSITIVE OPINION OF THE PLACE

00:32:50.101 --> 00:32:52.804
THEY CALL HOME. OUR STAFF IS

00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:54.372
THE BEST IN THE COUNTRY AND IT

00:32:54.439 --> 00:32:56.741
SHOWS. HOWEVER OUR ANALYSIS

00:32:56.808 --> 00:32:58.876
SHOWS THAT SEVERAL HOMES ARE

00:32:58.943 --> 00:33:01.312
JUST NOT IN AN IDEAL LOCATION.

00:33:01.379 --> 00:33:03.514
NOT IDEAL FOR HIRING STAFF NOT

00:33:03.581 --> 00:33:05.483
IDEAL FOR DELIVERING SERVICES

00:33:05.550 --> 00:33:07.752
OR FOR DRAWING IN VETERANS FROM

00:33:07.819 --> 00:33:09.420
THE NEARBY COMMUNITY. THIS

00:33:09.487 --> 00:33:11.222
CAUSES BY AGENCY SIGNIFICANT

00:33:11.289 --> 00:33:13.925
CHALLENGES OUR WEST LOS ANGELES

00:33:13.991 --> 00:33:16.127
AND YON PHIL HOMES FOR EXAMPLE

00:33:16.194 --> 00:33:18.229
ARE FAR FROM COMMUNITIES WITH

00:33:18.296 --> 00:33:20.264
AFFORDABLE HOUSING. RESIDENTS

00:33:20.331 --> 00:33:21.999
SAID FIVE OF OUR EIGHT HOMES

00:33:22.066 --> 00:33:23.768
HAVE TO TRAVEL BY BUS MORE THAN

00:33:23.835 --> 00:33:25.903
AN HOUR EACH WAY TO GET TO

00:33:25.970 --> 00:33:27.071
THEIR VA SPECIALTY CARE

00:33:27.138 --> 00:33:29.407
APPOINTMENTS. AND MORE THAN ARE

00:33:29.474 --> 00:33:31.442
HALF OF OUR BARSTOW HOME IS

00:33:31.509 --> 00:33:34.245
EMPTY BECAUSE OF ITS REMOTE

00:33:34.312 --> 00:33:36.547
LOCATION AND LACK OF DEMAND.

00:33:36.614 --> 00:33:38.316
THESE CHALLENGES ARE COMPOUNDED

00:33:38.383 --> 00:33:39.817
BY THE CHANGING NEEDS OF THE

00:33:39.884 --> 00:33:41.953
RESIDENTS IN OUR HOMES AND FOR

00:33:42.019 --> 00:33:44.155
A MOMENT I'D LIKE TO SHIFT. TO

00:33:44.222 --> 00:33:46.324
HAVE THOMAS MARTIN THE PRIMARY

00:33:46.391 --> 00:33:48.259
AUTHOR OF THE MASTER PLAN.

00:33:48.326 --> 00:33:49.727
OUTLINED THE STRUCTURE IN THE

00:33:49.794 --> 00:33:51.729
DEVELOPMENT OF THE REPORT AND

00:33:51.796 --> 00:33:53.030
DISCUSS HOW THE CHANGE YOU

00:33:53.097 --> 00:33:55.133
RESIDENT POPULATIONS IMPACT OUR

00:33:55.199 --> 00:33:57.268
OPERATIONS. AND ALL CLOSE WHEN

00:33:57.335 --> 00:33:59.170
HE FINISHES. OKAY THANK YOU

00:33:59.237 --> 00:34:01.406
MISTER SCRETARY- SECTORS BUT

00:34:01.472 --> 00:34:03.074
ONLY ONLY BEEN ON THE JOB FOR A

00:34:03.141 --> 00:34:05.076
COUPLE OF DAYS BUT- IT SEEMS

00:34:05.143 --> 00:34:07.712
THAT REALLY PICKED IT UP AND-

00:34:07.779 --> 00:34:09.380
OVER A SHORT TIME HERE. SO AS A

00:34:09.447 --> 00:34:10.648
SECTOR MENTION CREATING THE

00:34:10.715 --> 00:34:11.416
MASTER PLAN WAS A MAJOR

00:34:11.482 --> 00:34:13.584
UNDERTAKING FOR A FORD FOR THE

00:34:13.651 --> 00:34:15.086
DEPARTMENT FOR A STAFF. OF THE

00:34:15.153 --> 00:34:16.454
REQUIRED A LOT OF COLLABORATION

00:34:16.521 --> 00:34:18.556
WITH- WITH OUR RESIDENTS- AND

00:34:18.623 --> 00:34:20.691
WITH STAKEHOLDERS- WE HELD A

00:34:20.758 --> 00:34:22.427
NUMBER OF WORKSHOPS REBT

00:34:22.493 --> 00:34:25.430
STATES- WITH- AT DOZENS OF

00:34:25.496 --> 00:34:27.732
EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS- AS OUR

00:34:27.799 --> 00:34:28.666
DIMENSION LEGISLATORS ELECTED

00:34:28.733 --> 00:34:32.537
OFFICIALS- VETERANS SERVICE-

00:34:32.603 --> 00:34:35.039
ORGANIZATIONS- AND WE ALSO MET

00:34:35.106 --> 00:34:35.840
WITH MORE THAN A HUNDRED

00:34:35.907 --> 00:34:37.542
RESIDENTS. TO GET THEIR

00:34:37.608 --> 00:34:39.477
FEEDBACK ON HOMES WE ALSO- WE

00:34:39.544 --> 00:34:41.112
ALSO CONDUCTED TWO SURVEYS OF

00:34:41.179 --> 00:34:42.747
ALL THE RESIDENTS IN OUR HOMES.

00:34:42.814 --> 00:34:43.614
AT TO MAKE SURE WE REALLY

00:34:43.681 --> 00:34:45.716
UNDERSTANDING WHAT THEY SAW AS

00:34:45.783 --> 00:34:46.651
THE CURRENT TRAJECTORY OF HOMES

00:34:46.717 --> 00:34:50.188
IN WTH A- WITH A FEW FELT THE

00:34:50.254 --> 00:34:50.788
AT THE FUTURE SHOULD HAVE FOR

00:34:50.855 --> 00:34:53.090
THEM. SO I THE DEVELOPING THE

00:34:53.157 --> 00:34:54.091
STRUCTURE OF THE DRUM OF THE

00:34:54.158 --> 00:34:55.393
MASTER PLAN IN THE STRUCTURE

00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:58.596
THAT IN ITS- NEAR EACH OTHER'S

00:34:58.663 --> 00:35:00.531
WHEN WE WHEN WE STARTED THE

00:35:00.598 --> 00:35:03.401
FIRST STEP. WAS UNDERSTANDING

00:35:03.468 --> 00:35:03.935
HOW MANY VETERANS WE HAVE

00:35:04.001 --> 00:35:05.837
ACROSS THE STATE- WHERE THEY'RE

00:35:05.903 --> 00:35:08.906
LOCATED- WHETHER AGES WERE THAT

00:35:08.973 --> 00:35:10.875
HAVE INFORMATION ON TO GET A

00:35:10.942 --> 00:35:12.176
DEMOGRAPHIC BASS LINE JUST

00:35:12.243 --> 00:35:13.444
UNDERSTAND ON WHAT THE

00:35:13.511 --> 00:35:14.512
POPULATION IS THAT WE'RE

00:35:14.579 --> 00:35:17.048
LOOKING AT- AND ALSO HOW IT'S

00:35:17.114 --> 00:35:17.915
HOW IT'S GONNA BE CHANGING THE

00:35:17.982 --> 00:35:19.684
FUTURE. OF THE NEXT THING WE

00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:21.419
DID IS WE COLLECTED HEALTH

00:35:21.486 --> 00:35:23.154
DATA. FROM A VARIETY OF

00:35:23.221 --> 00:35:25.990
SOURCES- TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE

00:35:26.057 --> 00:35:28.192
KERANIQUE FOR SHIFTING IN THE

00:35:28.259 --> 00:35:30.795
POPULATION ITSELF- TO SEE HOW

00:35:30.862 --> 00:35:32.463
MUCH YOU SEE IF THEY REALLY

00:35:32.530 --> 00:35:34.198
CORRELATE EACH OTHER. AND AS

00:35:34.265 --> 00:35:37.034
THE AS THE SECRETARY SAID.

00:35:37.101 --> 00:35:37.502
WE'VE WE'VE GOT A REAL

00:35:37.568 --> 00:35:38.736
INTERESTING TRY THE BETTER

00:35:38.803 --> 00:35:41.439
POPULATION. IS DECLINING-

00:35:41.506 --> 00:35:42.707
CLEARLY IT'S GOING TO CLIMB BY

00:35:42.773 --> 00:35:45.543
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS- BUT- THOSE

00:35:45.610 --> 00:35:47.111
HEALTHCARE NEEDS ARE NOT

00:35:47.178 --> 00:35:49.480
DECLINING AT THE SAME RATE. I

00:35:49.547 --> 00:35:50.548
HELP HER NEED TO CONTINUE TO

00:35:50.615 --> 00:35:51.449
GROW- LIKELY DUE TO THE

00:35:51.516 --> 00:35:54.051
INCREASING ACUITY OF THE NEEDS

00:35:54.118 --> 00:35:56.420
OF VETERANS. AS WELL AS THE-

00:35:56.487 --> 00:35:58.155
THE PREVALENCE OF MULTIPLE

00:35:58.222 --> 00:36:00.825
OUTCOME OF IT CALL MORBID OR CO

00:36:00.892 --> 00:36:03.628
OCCURRING CONDITIONS. OUR WITH

00:36:03.694 --> 00:36:06.731
THIS DATA. ARE WE CAN FIX

00:36:06.797 --> 00:36:09.867
CAMPUS OTHER CARE PROVIDERS- TO

00:36:09.934 --> 00:36:11.736
FIND TO IDENTIFY WHAT OTHER

00:36:11.802 --> 00:36:13.237
SERVICES BEING PROVIDED OUT OUT

00:36:13.304 --> 00:36:14.572
FOR THE BETTER COMMUNITY. AND

00:36:14.639 --> 00:36:16.474
ALSO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE WHAT

00:36:16.541 --> 00:36:17.542
THE SHORTCOMINGS WERE WITH THE

00:36:17.608 --> 00:36:20.311
GAPS WERE. AND WHAT OUR ROLE

00:36:20.378 --> 00:36:21.479
SHOULD BE IN AN ADDRESSING

00:36:21.546 --> 00:36:23.548
THOSE SO IN THE PROCESS WE

00:36:23.614 --> 00:36:25.716
IDENTIFIED. WE DETERMINE THAT

00:36:25.783 --> 00:36:27.451
WE WERE REALLY THE ONLY MAJOR

00:36:27.518 --> 00:36:29.420
PROVIDER OF. A FACILITY BASED

00:36:29.487 --> 00:36:31.923
LONG TERM CARE. LIKELY BECAUSE

00:36:31.989 --> 00:36:33.991
OF THE- THE PROGRAMMATIC

00:36:34.058 --> 00:36:34.959
COMPLEXITY OF TRYING TO

00:36:35.026 --> 00:36:36.627
OPERATE. ON THOSE TYPES OF

00:36:36.694 --> 00:36:38.529
FACILITIES AS WELL AS THE- THE

00:36:38.596 --> 00:36:40.631
HIGH COST OF SKILLED NURSING

00:36:40.698 --> 00:36:43.367
AND GENERAL. OF WE ALSO

00:36:43.434 --> 00:36:44.769
REVIEWED WORKFORCE AND

00:36:44.835 --> 00:36:46.671
RESEARCH DATA FOR EACH SHOT FOR

00:36:46.737 --> 00:36:48.139
REGION THROUGHOUT THE STATE. TO

00:36:48.205 --> 00:36:49.907
IDENTIFY AREAS WHERE CURRENT

00:36:49.974 --> 00:36:52.209
AND POTENTIAL HYPOTHETICAL

00:36:52.276 --> 00:36:54.312
VETERANS HOMES ARE WHERE THAT

00:36:54.378 --> 00:36:56.047
WHERE THEY MIGHT BE SUCCESSFUL-

00:36:56.113 --> 00:36:57.315
AND I IT WILL TRY TO BETTER

00:36:57.381 --> 00:36:58.749
UNDERSTAND WHAT KIND OF WHAT

00:36:58.816 --> 00:36:59.584
KIND OF LOCAL RESOURCES YOU

00:36:59.650 --> 00:37:01.052
NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WOULD BE

00:37:01.118 --> 00:37:03.487
SUCCESSFUL. OF FINALLY WE

00:37:03.554 --> 00:37:05.189
REVIEWED OUR OWN INTERNAL DATA

00:37:05.256 --> 00:37:07.158
ON THE HOMES- WEEK WE COLLECTED

00:37:07.224 --> 00:37:09.060
AND MANUALLY REVIEWED MORE THAN

00:37:09.126 --> 00:37:10.227
TEN THOUSAND RECORDS. TO

00:37:10.294 --> 00:37:12.129
UNDERSTAND- OUR RESIDENTS

00:37:12.196 --> 00:37:14.498
DEMOGRAPHICS THE CHANGES IN THE

00:37:14.565 --> 00:37:16.734
CARE NEEDS- WHAT KIND OF

00:37:16.801 --> 00:37:18.803
DIAGNOSES THEY HAVE. A WHAT

00:37:18.869 --> 00:37:20.237
KIND OF CHALLENGES THE HOMES

00:37:20.304 --> 00:37:22.873
FACE- RELATED INFRASTRUCTURE

00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:25.076
RELATES TO WORK FORCE- THAT

00:37:25.142 --> 00:37:26.210
TYPE OF DATA TO REALLY

00:37:26.277 --> 00:37:29.547
UNDERSTAND- HOW THAT WAS GOING

00:37:29.614 --> 00:37:30.147
IMPACTS FOR THE FUTURE AND HOW

00:37:30.214 --> 00:37:32.416
WE CAN BEST PREPARE FOR IT. SO

00:37:32.483 --> 00:37:33.985
AS OUR TO MENTION SOME OF THE

00:37:34.051 --> 00:37:35.119
DATA WAS WAS REALLY EYE

00:37:35.186 --> 00:37:37.755
OPENING- LAST SUMMER- AS MUCH

00:37:37.822 --> 00:37:39.223
WE COLLECTED A NUMBER OF

00:37:39.290 --> 00:37:40.858
INTERNAL RECORDSAND THE

00:37:40.925 --> 00:37:41.792
PROCESS WE REVIEWED EVERY

00:37:41.859 --> 00:37:43.594
SINGLE RESIDENTS- MEDICAL

00:37:43.661 --> 00:37:46.564
RECORDS AT EVERY HOME. I SO

00:37:46.631 --> 00:37:47.398
WHEN WE WHEN WE DID THAT WE

00:37:47.465 --> 00:37:49.367
IDENTIFIED- WAIT WE DETERMINE

00:37:49.433 --> 00:37:51.268
THAT THE PROP ABOUT TWO THIRDS

00:37:51.335 --> 00:37:52.637
OF OUR VIETNAM WAR VETERANS

00:37:52.703 --> 00:37:54.405
CURRENTLY LIVING IN A HOMES

00:37:54.472 --> 00:37:56.340
HAVE AT LEAST ONE BEHAVIORAL

00:37:56.407 --> 00:37:58.876
HEALTH AT DIAGNOSIS ABOUT TWO

00:37:58.943 --> 00:38:02.113
THIRDS COMPARED TO ONLY 40%

00:38:02.179 --> 00:38:03.781
AMONG HERBAL WERE TO RESIDENTS.

00:38:03.848 --> 00:38:06.817
I FURTHER MORE THAN 80% OF OUR

00:38:06.884 --> 00:38:08.853
VETERANS UNDER THE AGE OF SIXTY

00:38:08.919 --> 00:38:10.454
FIVE HAD AT LEAST ONE DIAGNOSIS

00:38:10.521 --> 00:38:11.789
SO. TWO THIRDS OF VIETNAM

00:38:11.856 --> 00:38:13.991
VETERANS 40% OF OVER TWO BUT

00:38:14.058 --> 00:38:16.394
MORE THAN 80% OF OUR YOUNGER

00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:18.996
VETERANS UNDER SIXTY FIVE. THEY

00:38:19.063 --> 00:38:19.997
ARE BECAUSE OF THERE'S THIS

00:38:20.064 --> 00:38:21.632
GROWING NEED WE CAN SEE THIS AS

00:38:21.699 --> 00:38:23.634
THE THAT AS- KIND OF THE START

00:38:23.701 --> 00:38:25.069
OF A GROWING WAVE THAT'S GOING

00:38:25.136 --> 00:38:27.304
TO COMING TOWARDS US- WE CAN WE

00:38:27.371 --> 00:38:28.506
RECOGNIZE THAT OUR MIDDLE HAS

00:38:28.572 --> 00:38:30.307
HEALTH STAFFER ARE STRUGGLING

00:38:30.374 --> 00:38:31.642
TO MEET. MEET THE DEMAND FOR

00:38:31.709 --> 00:38:34.278
SERVICES AND TO KEEP KEEP PACE

00:38:34.345 --> 00:38:37.615
WITH THE CHANGES. SIMILARLY THE

00:38:37.682 --> 00:38:39.483
DEMAND FOR SKILLED NURSING IS

00:38:39.550 --> 00:38:42.019
ALSO VERY HIGH- IN THE LAST TEN

00:38:42.086 --> 00:38:43.788
YEARS WE OPEN FIVE NEW VETERANS

00:38:43.854 --> 00:38:46.323
HOMES- IN THE PROCESS WE

00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:47.591
DOUBLED OUR CAPACITY FOR

00:38:47.658 --> 00:38:48.993
SKILLED NURSING. ACROSS THE

00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:51.128
SYSTEM- DESPITE THIS WE STILL

00:38:51.195 --> 00:38:53.664
HAVE A LOT OF DEMAND AND- LEAVE

00:38:53.731 --> 00:38:54.198
THE WEIGHTLESS FOR SKILLED

00:38:54.265 --> 00:38:56.701
NURSING UNITS- COMPARATIVELY

00:38:56.767 --> 00:38:58.102
THERE'S LITTLE DEMAND FOR OUR

00:38:58.169 --> 00:38:59.770
DOMICILIARY CARE UNITS AND OUR

00:38:59.837 --> 00:39:01.939
IMMEDIATE CARE UNITS- EACH

00:39:02.006 --> 00:39:04.608
WHICH- IS. OUTDATED AND HAS

00:39:04.675 --> 00:39:06.243
SOMEWHAT LIMITED USE FOR

00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:08.446
TODAY'S VETERANS. OUR RESIDENT

00:39:08.512 --> 00:39:09.780
POPULATIONS CHANGE DRAMATICALLY

00:39:09.847 --> 00:39:11.148
OVER THE LAST DECADE AND WE CAN

00:39:11.215 --> 00:39:12.550
EXPECT ALL THESE TRENDS TO

00:39:12.616 --> 00:39:14.685
CONTINUE INTO THE FUTURE- AND-

00:39:14.752 --> 00:39:16.187
SO FOR MORE GENERATION ABOUT

00:39:16.253 --> 00:39:17.188
THE LIVES CARE WE CORPORATE

00:39:17.254 --> 00:39:18.522
CURRENTLY PROVIDE AND THE AT

00:39:18.589 --> 00:39:20.491
THE BUDGET BETS AT EACH. ARE

00:39:20.558 --> 00:39:21.459
YOU CAN TAKE A LOOK AT THAT

00:39:21.525 --> 00:39:23.427
TABLE FOUR ON PAGE TO THE

00:39:23.494 --> 00:39:25.696
HANDOUT. SO BASED ON ALL THIS

00:39:25.763 --> 00:39:29.233
INFORMATION COLLECTED- WITHIN A

00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:29.633
FIVE TWENTY SEVEN

00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:30.067
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR

00:39:30.134 --> 00:39:31.736
CONSIDERATION. EACH OF THE

00:39:31.802 --> 00:39:33.404
RECOMMENDATIONS IS SUPPORTED BY

00:39:33.471 --> 00:39:35.573
THE DATA WE COLLECTED- BOTH

00:39:35.639 --> 00:39:37.408
INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL DATA AS

00:39:37.475 --> 00:39:38.709
WELL AS THE- THE WEALTH OF

00:39:38.776 --> 00:39:41.011
STAKEHOLDER INFORMATION WE- WE-

00:39:41.078 --> 00:39:41.879
WE RECEIVED THROUGHOUT THE

00:39:41.946 --> 00:39:43.848
PROCESS. SO WITH THAT I'LL TURN

00:39:43.914 --> 00:39:45.149
IT OVER TO THE SECRETARY TO

00:39:45.216 --> 00:39:46.917
WALK TO THE RECOMMENDATIONS AND

00:39:46.984 --> 00:39:48.886
HOW THEY FIT INTO OUR FUTURE.

00:39:48.953 --> 00:39:51.255
SOME OF. SO WHAT DO ALL THESE

00:39:51.322 --> 00:39:53.157
FACTS IN MIND THE MASTER PLAN

00:39:53.224 --> 00:39:54.825
OFFERS CONCRETE STEPS FOR

00:39:54.892 --> 00:39:55.960
CALIFORNIA TO PREPARE FOR THE

00:39:56.026 --> 00:39:58.262
FUTURE OF LONG TERM CARE

00:39:58.329 --> 00:40:00.197
VETERAN CARE WE MUST BEGIN

00:40:00.264 --> 00:40:01.665
TAILORING OUR PROGRAMS FOR

00:40:01.732 --> 00:40:03.300
VIETNAM AND GULF WAR VETERANS

00:40:03.367 --> 00:40:05.603
NOW IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THE

00:40:05.669 --> 00:40:06.670
RIGHT SERVICES WHEN THE TIME

00:40:06.737 --> 00:40:08.606
COMES AND TO MAXIMIZE OUR

00:40:08.672 --> 00:40:10.040
RESOURCES FOR THE BENEFITS OF

00:40:10.107 --> 00:40:11.642
ALL OF OUR RESIDENTS. SO TO

00:40:11.709 --> 00:40:15.312
START. WE RECOMMEND ELIMINATING

00:40:15.379 --> 00:40:17.148
INTERMEDIATE CARE. AS A LEVEL

00:40:17.214 --> 00:40:20.017
OF CARE. AND REDUCING

00:40:20.084 --> 00:40:22.586
DOMICILIARY CARE AND INSTEAD

00:40:22.653 --> 00:40:24.388
FOCUS ON ASSISTED LIVING AND

00:40:24.455 --> 00:40:26.624
SKILLED NURSING WHICH HAVE FAR

00:40:26.690 --> 00:40:28.592
GREATER DEMAND AND HAVE PROVEN

00:40:28.659 --> 00:40:31.495
MORE EFFECTIVE. THE LEVEL OF

00:40:31.562 --> 00:40:33.197
CARE IS THOMAS MENTIONED IS-

00:40:33.264 --> 00:40:36.567
DELINEATED ON- TABLE FOR WHICH

00:40:36.634 --> 00:40:37.201
IS THE SECOND PAGE OF YOUR HAND

00:40:37.268 --> 00:40:40.671
OUT. JUST A FOOTNOTE OR IT MAY

00:40:40.738 --> 00:40:43.140
BE A PARENTHESIS- INTERMEDIATE

00:40:43.207 --> 00:40:45.743
CARE IS A DINOSAUR LEVEL OF

00:40:45.810 --> 00:40:48.712
CARE IF IT EXISTS. IN VERY VERY

00:40:48.779 --> 00:40:51.115
FEW PLACES IN CALIFORNIA AND

00:40:51.182 --> 00:40:51.782
THEY'RE ALL RUN BY THE STATE OF

00:40:51.849 --> 00:40:54.084
CALIFORNIA. THAT EXISTS IN OUR

00:40:54.151 --> 00:40:55.452
VETERANS HOMES AND IN THE STATE

00:40:55.519 --> 00:40:57.388
HOSPITALS AND THAT'S IT. OF

00:40:57.454 --> 00:40:58.556
PEOPLE WHO ARE AN INTERMEDIATE

00:40:58.622 --> 00:41:01.358
CARE CARE COULD EASILY UPGRADE

00:41:01.425 --> 00:41:02.493
EITHER TO A SKILLED NURSING

00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:05.062
BAD. OR MOVE DOWN DEPENDING ON

00:41:05.129 --> 00:41:06.197
HOW MANY ACTIVITIES OF DAILY

00:41:06.263 --> 00:41:08.499
LIVING THEY CAN ACCOMPLISH DOWN

00:41:08.566 --> 00:41:10.034
TO THE ASSISTED LIVING. WE

00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:11.969
COULD EASILY. PHASE THAT AWAY

00:41:12.036 --> 00:41:13.470
WHEN I SAY GET RID OF THAT

00:41:13.537 --> 00:41:15.439
LEVEL OF CARE I DO NOT MEAN.

00:41:15.506 --> 00:41:18.242
DISMISSING ANY SINGLE RESIDENT

00:41:18.309 --> 00:41:18.809
FROM THE HOME WHO'S IN THAT

00:41:18.876 --> 00:41:20.878
LEVEL OF CARE. THEY WOULD JUST

00:41:20.945 --> 00:41:24.481
BE ASSIGNED TO A DIFFERENT ONE.

00:41:24.548 --> 00:41:25.850
THIS YEAR THE ADMINISTRATION

00:41:25.916 --> 00:41:27.518
HAS SUBMITTED THE PCP TO DO

00:41:27.585 --> 00:41:29.620
JUST THAT STARTING THE LONG

00:41:29.687 --> 00:41:31.889
PROCESS. OF RESHAPING OUR

00:41:31.956 --> 00:41:33.824
BARSTOW CHULA VISTA AND YON

00:41:33.891 --> 00:41:35.893
PHIL HOMES BY REFOCUSING

00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:37.761
EFFORTS AND RESOURCES ON MORE

00:41:37.828 --> 00:41:39.797
APPROPRIATE LEVELS OF CARE TO

00:41:39.864 --> 00:41:41.232
BE CLEAR ONCE AGAIN NO CURRENT

00:41:41.298 --> 00:41:43.367
RESIDENT OF ANY HOME WOULD BE

00:41:43.434 --> 00:41:45.469
JUST CHARGED AS PART OF ANY

00:41:45.536 --> 00:41:48.339
TRANSITION EFFORT. THE B. C. P.

00:41:48.405 --> 00:41:49.173
THAT ACCOMPANIES THE MASTER

00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:51.108
PLAN ALSO IMPROVES BEHAVIORAL

00:41:51.175 --> 00:41:53.010
HEALTH STAFFING ACROSS THE

00:41:53.077 --> 00:41:54.745
SYSTEM ENSURING THAT OUR

00:41:54.812 --> 00:41:56.347
RESIDENTS HAVE BETTER ACCESS TO

00:41:56.413 --> 00:41:58.949
PSYCHIATRISTS PSYCHOLOGISTS AND

00:41:59.016 --> 00:42:00.284
SOCIAL WORKERS WHEN THEY NEED

00:42:00.351 --> 00:42:02.419
THEMOST. THE MASTER PLAN

00:42:02.486 --> 00:42:03.787
INCLUDES RECOMMENDATIONS FOR

00:42:03.854 --> 00:42:05.589
EACH OF OUR VETERANS HOMES

00:42:05.656 --> 00:42:07.291
INCLUDING SEVERAL FOR THE YOUNG

00:42:07.358 --> 00:42:09.460
FULL CAMPUS ALONE. MOST

00:42:09.526 --> 00:42:10.561
CRITICALLY THE MASTER PLAN

00:42:10.628 --> 00:42:13.063
HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED TO REPLACE

00:42:13.130 --> 00:42:15.499
THEIR THE AGING HALDEMAN

00:42:15.566 --> 00:42:17.434
BUILDING WITH A NEW STATE OF

00:42:17.501 --> 00:42:18.335
THE ART SKILLED NURSING

00:42:18.402 --> 00:42:20.437
FACILITY. AND WITHOUT IT THE

00:42:20.504 --> 00:42:22.039
HOME CANNOT PROVIDE THE QUALITY

00:42:22.106 --> 00:42:24.208
OF CARE FOR COMING GENERATIONS

00:42:24.275 --> 00:42:26.310
OF VETERANS. A MASTER PLAN ALSO

00:42:26.377 --> 00:42:28.779
SUGGEST SUGGEST EXPANDING

00:42:28.846 --> 00:42:30.814
PROPERTY USE AT THE YOUNG FILL

00:42:30.881 --> 00:42:32.983
HOME TO MAXIMIZE THE USE OF THE

00:42:33.050 --> 00:42:35.586
LAND WITHOUT PLACING BURDENS ON

00:42:35.653 --> 00:42:38.055
THE GENERAL FUND. OF COURSE ANY

00:42:38.122 --> 00:42:39.690
SUCH PROPERTY USE HAS TO FOLLOW

00:42:39.757 --> 00:42:41.926
THE LAW AND PROVIDE A BENEFIT

00:42:41.992 --> 00:42:43.894
TO RESIDENTS OF THE HOME BUT I

00:42:43.961 --> 00:42:45.629
BELIEVE THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES

00:42:45.696 --> 00:42:46.864
FOR GROWTH THAT MEET OUR

00:42:46.931 --> 00:42:48.966
STATUTORY OBLIGATIONS WHILE

00:42:49.033 --> 00:42:51.201
ALLOWING FOR GREATER SUPPORT.

00:42:51.268 --> 00:42:53.237
OF CALIFORNIA'S VETERANS. THESE

00:42:53.304 --> 00:42:55.673
ARE ONLY A FEW OF THE TWENTY

00:42:55.739 --> 00:42:56.273
SEVEN RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE

00:42:56.340 --> 00:42:58.842
MASTER PLAN BRIEFLY SOME OF THE

00:42:58.909 --> 00:42:59.944
OTHERS WOULD SUGGEST THE

00:43:00.010 --> 00:43:02.980
FOLLOWING. ONE IMPROVE

00:43:03.047 --> 00:43:04.848
COORDINATION WITH SUPPORT OF

00:43:04.915 --> 00:43:07.151
HOUSING PROGRAMS SUCH AS V. H.

00:43:07.217 --> 00:43:10.321
H. P. TO ENSURE THAT THE HOMES

00:43:10.387 --> 00:43:12.356
CAN AFFECT EFFECTIVELY SERVE

00:43:12.423 --> 00:43:14.925
HOMELESS VETERANS. THOSE WHO

00:43:14.992 --> 00:43:17.728
ARE IN NEED OF LONG TERM CARE.

00:43:17.795 --> 00:43:19.396
TO PROVIDE CLEAR CRITERIA FOR

00:43:19.463 --> 00:43:21.498
DEVELOPING ANY FUTURE VETERANS

00:43:21.565 --> 00:43:23.667
HOME TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE

00:43:23.734 --> 00:43:25.402
LOCATED IN THE MOST APPROPRIATE

00:43:25.469 --> 00:43:28.005
COMMUNITIES. LET ME MAKE SURE

00:43:28.072 --> 00:43:29.606
I'M I'M CLEAR I'M NOT PROPOSING

00:43:29.673 --> 00:43:30.808
THE CALVET START THE

00:43:30.874 --> 00:43:31.442
CONSTRUCTION OF ANY NEW

00:43:31.508 --> 00:43:33.444

COLUMNS ARE WHAT I CALL VETOES

00:43:47.691 --> 00:43:49.626
FIVE RULES FOR FUTURE VETERAN

00:43:49.693 --> 00:43:52.196
HOME CONSTRUCTION. A BETTER A

00:43:52.262 --> 00:43:54.765
NEW VETERANS HOME MUST BE

00:43:54.832 --> 00:43:56.367
LOCATED IN AN AREA WHERE

00:43:56.433 --> 00:43:57.701
THERE'S A HIGH DENSITY OF

00:43:57.768 --> 00:43:58.836
VETERANS AND THERE'S A HIGH

00:43:58.902 --> 00:44:00.804

HAS TO OFFER APPROPRIATE LEVELS

00:44:07.077 --> 00:44:08.545
OF CARE AND THOSE LEVELS OF

00:44:08.612 --> 00:44:09.713
CARE NEED TO EXIST IN THE

00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:11.248
COMMUNITY. THAT'S THE FOURTH

00:44:11.315 --> 00:44:12.583
COLUMN THERE HASTO BE A LOCAL

00:44:12.649 --> 00:44:15.152

00:45:25.255 --> 00:45:27.858
SUCCESSFUL FOR DECADES TO COME.

00:45:27.925 --> 00:45:29.927
HOWEVER I KNOW I CANNOT ACT ON

FURTHER THESE RECOMMENDATIONS

00:45:55.119 --> 00:45:55.619
FOR TO MAKE THEM COMPLY WITH

00:50:30.894 --> 00:50:32.329
THAT THOSE LARGER METROPOLITAN

00:50:32.396 --> 00:50:34.197
AREAS WOULD BE WHERE I WOULD GO

00:50:34.264 --> 00:50:36.099
LOOKING WELL FOR A FOR OF STATE

ELOQUENTLY SAID EARLY ON. ON

00:50:55.318 --> 00:50:57.087
CAL THAT IS THE ONLY ENTITY IN

00:50:57.154 --> 00:50:58.321
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT

00:50:58.388 --> 00:51:02.826
OFFERS VETERANS A LONG TERM

00:51:02.893 --> 00:51:05.495
CARE OPTION IN COMMUNITY. THERE

CALIFORNIAHAS VETERANS THEY

00:51:08.064 --> 00:51:09.599
MIGHT HAVE A HUNDRED RESIDENTS

00:51:09.666 --> 00:51:10.400
WITH THE THREE OF THEM ARE

00:51:10.467 --> 00:51:12.035
VETERANS AND I DARE SAY THEY

00:51:12.102 --> 00:51:14.871
DON'T GET A SPECIAL. TREATMENT

00:51:14.938 --> 00:51:17.741
FOR THAT YOU MEAN YOU MEAN. BY

00:51:17.808 --> 00:51:20.243
A FACILITY THAT IS. INTERESTED

00:51:20.310 --> 00:51:22.446
IN PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN

00:51:22.512 --> 00:51:24.614
THE VETERANS WELFARE. IT HAS

00:51:24.681 --> 00:51:26.049
NOTHING TO DO WITH COST WHO

PAYS EXACTLY EXACTLY WHAT IS

00:51:29.319 --> 00:51:30.053
THERE THAT'S THE INTANGIBLE

00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:32.122
BENEFIT OF RUNNING A FACILITY

00:51:32.189 --> 00:51:33.757
CREEKS AND JUST TO JUST TO KIND

00:51:33.824 --> 00:51:34.991
OF JUMP IN SO WHEN WE WHEN WE

00:51:35.058 --> 00:51:36.493

00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:39.129
WITH- WITH- WITH RESIDENTS-

00:51:39.196 --> 00:51:40.664
THEY WERE COUPLE OF RESPONSES I

00:51:40.730 --> 00:51:41.565
THINK WE'RE KIND OF ON POINTS

00:51:41.631 --> 00:51:43.066
THAT NUMBER OF A RESIDENTS WERE

00:51:43.133 --> 00:51:45.168
NOT INTERESTED IN A NURSING

00:51:45.235 --> 00:51:47.037
HOME- THEY WERE INTERESTED IN

00:51:47.103 --> 00:51:48.538
VETERANS HOME THEY'RE WILLING

00:51:48.605 --> 00:51:50.841
TO GO TO VETERANS HOME BUT THEY

00:51:50.907 --> 00:51:52.008
WERE NOT INTERESTED IN. OTHER

00:51:52.075 --> 00:51:52.542
OTHER LONG TERM CARE THAT

00:51:52.609 --> 00:51:54.311

NURSING HOME I'M IN A VETERANS

00:51:58.381 --> 00:51:59.449
HOME SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S

00:51:59.516 --> 00:52:00.484
THAT'S KIND OF AN ATTENTION

00:52:00.550 --> 00:52:01.685
THING THAT WAS IMPORTANT TO

00:52:01.751 --> 00:52:04.054
THEM- OTHERS HAD COME FROM A

00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:04.554

YOU TALK ABOUT HOW- VIETNAM

00:57:55.338 --> 00:57:58.241
VETS AND POST VIETNAM VETS.

00:57:58.308 --> 00:57:59.642
HAVE A HIGHER NEED FOR

00:57:59.709 --> 00:58:01.511
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND MENTAL

00:58:01.578 --> 00:58:04.881
HEALTH NEEDS AS OPPOSED TO WERE

00:58:04.948 --> 00:58:05.481

TIME THAT THEY WERE EXPOSED TO

00:58:22.966 --> 00:58:25.034
THE KIND OF BALLISTIC INJURIES

00:58:25.101 --> 00:58:26.703
OF THE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN

00:58:26.769 --> 00:58:28.304
UNIFORM A SMALLER PROPORTION

00:58:28.371 --> 00:58:31.140
WERE EXPOSED IN THAT WAY-

00:58:31.207 --> 00:58:32.575
CURRENT CONFLICT VETERANS ARE

00:58:32.642 --> 00:58:34.310
GOING OFF REPETITIVELY FOUR

00:58:34.377 --> 00:58:36.880
YEAR LONG ROTATIONS- THEY'RE IN

HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE GLAUCOMA.

00:58:56.933 --> 00:58:58.735
JUST GENERIC FOR EASY TO TREAT

00:58:58.801 --> 00:59:00.904
THINGS NOW OUR SOLDIERS ARE

00:59:00.970 --> 00:59:03.072
COMING BACK WITH. MULTIPLE

00:59:03.139 --> 00:59:05.008
DIAGNOSIS FROM THE COLLAR BONE

00:59:05.074 --> 00:59:06.776
UP MORE DIFFICULT TO HANDLE

00:59:06.843 --> 00:59:08.912
EXACERBATING THEIR UNDERLYING

00:59:08.978 --> 00:59:10.880
MEDICAL CONDITIONS WITH THEIR

00:59:10.947 --> 00:59:11.948
BEHAVIOR ON MENTAL HEALTH

00:59:12.015 --> 00:59:16.920
THINGS OF PTSD- SO. THAT'S

00:59:16.986 --> 00:59:18.755
THAT'S THE START OF IT. THE

00:59:18.821 --> 00:59:19.355
START OF THE IT IT'S HARD FROM

00:59:19.422 --> 00:59:20.590
TO READ BUT BUT I READ THE

00:59:20.657 --> 00:59:23.259
PRESIDENT I'D STATES OF JUST

00:59:23.326 --> 00:59:25.628
JUST SAID THAT AS TO THE THIRTY

00:59:25.695 --> 00:59:26.896
FOR THE OF THOSE SOLDIERS THEY

00:59:26.963 --> 00:59:28.364
WERE INJURED THAT THEY JUST

00:59:28.431 --> 00:59:29.365
HAVE MINOR HEADACHES AND THAT

00:59:29.432 --> 00:59:31.301
THAT'S NOT REALLY A BIG DEAL.

00:59:31.367 --> 00:59:32.468
SO I YOU DON'T ACTUALLY NEED TO

00:59:32.535 --> 00:59:34.437
COMMENT I DON'T WANT TO GO DOWN

00:59:34.504 --> 00:59:36.873

01:09:16.185 --> 01:09:20.155
PEOPLE. PRETTY MUCH NO NEEDS

01:09:20.222 --> 01:09:24.693
IT'S JEFF. IT JUST ROOM IN

01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:29.365
HERE'S THE APARTMENT. AND

01:09:29.431 --> 01:09:31.100
THAT'S THAT'S NOT REALLY WHAT

01:09:31.166 --> 01:09:33.335
HOW VH PEAS OPERATES SO CAN

01:09:33.402 --> 01:09:34.837
FEATURES PEAS ARE FOCUSED ON

01:09:34.904 --> 01:09:35.804
OBVIOUSLY THEY THERE'S A

01:09:35.871 --> 01:09:37.072
HOUSING COMPONENT THEY THEY

01:09:37.139 --> 01:09:39.408
WANNA MAKE SURE THEY HAVE- AT

01:09:39.475 --> 01:09:40.809
HAVE THE PROGRAM HOUSING SECURE

01:09:40.876 --> 01:09:42.077
HOUSING. BUT ALSO THEY MAKE

01:09:42.144 --> 01:09:43.312
SURE THAT THEY HAVE ACCESS TO

01:09:43.379 --> 01:09:47.116
VOCATIONAL PROGRAMS AND- A

01:09:47.182 --> 01:09:48.784
SUBSIDIES- PROGRAMS AS A NEED

01:09:48.851 --> 01:09:50.853
IT'S- COUNT JOB COUNSELLING

01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:52.421
EVERS ALL SORTS OF OTHER

01:09:52.488 --> 01:09:54.790
SERVICES- THAT ARE NOT REALLY

01:09:54.857 --> 01:09:57.026
PART OF HOW THAT THE DINOSAURS

01:09:57.092 --> 01:09:58.394
OPERATE. BUT THE OTHER KEY PART

01:09:58.460 --> 01:10:00.262
TO IT UNDER THE KEY PART IS THE

01:10:00.329 --> 01:10:02.064
LOCATION SO THE VETERANS HOME

01:10:02.131 --> 01:10:04.567
TO HAVE DOMICILIARY. ON THE

OTHER ONES WITH NO DEMAND ON

01:10:06.502 --> 01:10:08.537
THOSE ARE THE YON PHIL AND-

01:10:08.604 --> 01:10:11.807
BARSTOW HOMES. THOSE HOMES

01:10:11.874 --> 01:10:13.175
LIKELY NOT VERY CONDUCIVE TO

01:10:13.242 --> 01:10:15.844
TRYING TO OPERATE A HOMELESS

01:10:15.911 --> 01:10:16.779
HOMELESSNESS SUPPORT PROGRAM

01:10:16.845 --> 01:10:18.614
BECAUSE A THERE'S NOT A LOT

01:10:18.681 --> 01:10:20.449
HOMELESS VETERANS IN THAT AREA-

01:10:20.516 --> 01:10:23.252
THEY DON'T SEEM TO MIGRATE TO

01:10:23.319 --> 01:10:23.852
THE MIDDLE OF THE OF THE HIGH

01:10:23.919 --> 01:10:26.922
DESERT OR OR- OR WINE COUNTRY-

01:10:26.989 --> 01:10:30.793
BUT ALSO. AS BE THAT THE OTHER

01:10:30.859 --> 01:10:32.595
SUPPORTING MISTER I THE GENERAL

01:10:32.661 --> 01:10:37.566
PREVENTER SO WHAT. THERE WITH A

01:10:37.633 --> 01:10:38.367
YOU KNOW THAT'S KIND. IT'S KIND

01:10:38.434 --> 01:10:40.002
OF THE END OF EITHER SIR I

01:10:40.069 --> 01:10:40.569
GUESS YOU KNOW THE COME THE

01:10:40.636 --> 01:10:41.470
VETERANS HOME. THE INTO THE

01:10:41.537 --> 01:10:42.037
DUMBEST. GENERALLY THEY'LL

01:10:42.104 --> 01:10:42.671
THEY'LL KIND OF STAY IN THE FOR

01:10:42.738 --> 01:10:44.306
THE THEIR LIFE A THEY MIGHT

01:10:44.373 --> 01:10:45.240
WORK TO HAVE TO A HIGHER LEVEL

01:10:45.307 --> 01:10:47.042
OF CARE. AND RESERVATIONS P. A

01:10:47.109 --> 01:10:49.378
BIG PART OF THE V. H. P. IS TO.

01:10:49.445 --> 01:10:50.813
IS TO GET THEM THOSE ADDITIONAL

01:10:50.879 --> 01:10:53.816
SERVICES AND HELP THEM. GET A

01:10:53.882 --> 01:10:55.317
JOB WE INTEGRATE- THOSE TYPES

01:10:55.384 --> 01:10:56.919
OF THINGS SO IT'S BATES MEANT

01:10:56.986 --> 01:10:59.722
MORE TO BE A- YEAH. SHORT TERM

01:10:59.788 --> 01:11:00.889
I GUESS. AND THIS OPERATE

01:11:00.956 --> 01:11:02.424
PHRASING BUT- YOU KNOW

01:11:02.491 --> 01:11:03.626
HOPEFULLY TO HELP THEM I REALLY

01:11:03.692 --> 01:11:04.860
GAINED. IN THE COMMUNITY SO.

01:11:04.927 --> 01:11:05.894
AND I'M SAYING A LOT THINGS YOU

01:11:05.961 --> 01:11:07.062
OBVIOUSLY ALREADY NOW BUT AT

01:11:07.129 --> 01:11:08.564
THE HELM. BUT HOPEFULLY THAT

01:11:08.631 --> 01:11:09.531
KIND OF MAKES CLEAR THERE'S

01:11:09.598 --> 01:11:10.833
THERE IS A DISTINCTION THE

01:11:10.899 --> 01:11:13.369
POPULATION SERVE SO. WHEN YOU

01:11:13.435 --> 01:11:15.237
LOOK AT THE DOMICILIARY. IN IN

01:11:15.304 --> 01:11:16.138
THE NURSING HOME JUMPER

01:11:16.205 --> 01:11:18.340
BARSTOW. GENERALLY THE PEOPLE

01:11:18.407 --> 01:11:19.141
WHO ARE INTERESTED IN

01:11:19.208 --> 01:11:21.076
DOMICILIARY. DON'T QUALIFY

01:11:21.143 --> 01:11:22.544
BECAUSE THEY HAVE CARE NEEDS

01:11:22.611 --> 01:11:24.213
THAT A MORE SIGNIFICANT- OR

01:11:24.279 --> 01:11:26.682
THEY NEED THIS OTHER SERVICES.

01:11:26.749 --> 01:11:27.216
AND THE PEOPLE WHO SHOULD

01:11:27.282 --> 01:11:29.351
QUALIFY. WE DON'T HAVE NEEDS

01:11:29.418 --> 01:11:30.319
ARE GENERALLY NOT APPLYING

01:11:30.386 --> 01:11:31.487
THEY'RE NOT INTERESTED SO

01:11:31.553 --> 01:11:32.421
THAT'S KIND OF INTERESTING SO

01:11:32.488 --> 01:11:33.322
THERE'S NO A WHOLE LOT OF

01:11:33.389 --> 01:11:34.857
OVERLAP THAT WE SEE BETWEEN

01:11:34.923 --> 01:11:36.825
THOSE TWO POPULATIONS. RIGHT

01:11:36.892 --> 01:11:39.328
AND THEN- AS YOU MOVE TOWARD I

01:11:39.395 --> 01:11:40.796
MEAN POTENTIALLY MOVE TOWARD

01:11:40.863 --> 01:11:41.864
THESE SKILLED NURSING

01:11:41.930 --> 01:11:44.533
FACILITIES ARE OR MORE- BEDS

01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:47.736
FOR- MEMORY CARE. OF DO YOU SEE

01:11:47.803 --> 01:11:49.171
THE TOTAL NUMBER AND- THE

01:11:49.238 --> 01:11:51.006
ELIMINATING SLOWLY-

01:11:51.073 --> 01:11:53.976
DOMICILIARY. DO YOU SEE THE

01:11:54.043 --> 01:11:56.011
NUMBER OF TOTAL THAT'S GOING

01:11:56.078 --> 01:11:58.447
DOWN AT THE FACILITIES.

01:11:58.514 --> 01:12:01.550
PROBABLY PROBABLY BUT THE BEDS

01:12:01.617 --> 01:12:02.785
THAT WERE LEUCINE ONCE AGAIN

01:12:02.851 --> 01:12:05.721
ARE ONES THAT GIVE US VERY

01:12:05.788 --> 01:12:06.388
LITTLE AND FEDERAL

01:12:06.455 --> 01:12:09.091
REIMBURSEMENT. AND THOSE PEOPLE

01:12:09.158 --> 01:12:10.926
CAN IF YOU IF YOU'LL CONSIDER

01:12:10.993 --> 01:12:12.394
THE V. H. H. P. HOMELESS UP

01:12:12.461 --> 01:12:15.030
POPULATION AND THE- LONG TERM

01:12:15.097 --> 01:12:16.265
CARE THAT WE PROVIDE OUR HOMES

01:12:16.331 --> 01:12:17.900
AS VENN DIAGRAMS THERE'S AN

01:12:17.966 --> 01:12:22.237
OVERLAP. AND WE'RE ABLE BY A

01:12:22.304 --> 01:12:24.406
WARM HAND OFF PROCESS TO TAKE

01:12:24.473 --> 01:12:26.175
THOSE FEW PEOPLE IN THE V. H.

01:12:26.241 --> 01:12:28.210
H. P. PROGRAMS WHO THEN REQUIRE

01:12:28.277 --> 01:12:30.279
LONG TERM CARE IN NURSING HOMES

01:12:30.345 --> 01:12:32.481
WE CAN TAKE THE MAN NOT

01:12:32.548 --> 01:12:35.350
EVERYBODY BY FAR IN AND OUR VH

01:12:35.417 --> 01:12:38.020
H. P. HOUSING NEEDS LONG TERM

01:12:38.087 --> 01:12:41.590
CARE. RIGHT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:12:41.657 --> 01:12:42.458
PETRIE-NORRIS AND THEN I WILL

01:12:42.524 --> 01:12:43.926
TURN IT BACK OVER HIS SENATOR

01:12:43.992 --> 01:12:45.861
ARCH LET OF YOU KNOW I JUST

01:12:45.928 --> 01:12:48.731
OKAY OKAY AND JUST PICKING UP

01:12:48.797 --> 01:12:50.733
ON ON THAT QUESTION IN TERMS OF

01:12:50.799 --> 01:12:52.434
THAT WHETHER OR NOT E FORECAST

01:12:52.501 --> 01:12:54.503
NUMBER OF PETS TO GO DOWN AND

01:12:54.570 --> 01:12:56.205
YOU SAID PROBABLY I'M JUST IN

01:12:56.271 --> 01:12:57.639
THE EMPLOYEES AT PICKING UP ON

01:12:57.706 --> 01:13:00.242
AT THE CHAIRS QUESTION AROUND

01:13:00.309 --> 01:13:01.610
WHETHER OR NOT WE WOULD EXPECT

01:13:01.677 --> 01:13:03.746
THE NUMBER OF BEDS TO GO DOWN

01:13:03.812 --> 01:13:05.581
YOUR ANSWER IS PROBABLY. SU I'M

01:13:05.647 --> 01:13:07.716
LOOKING AT PAGE NINETY FOUR IN

01:13:07.783 --> 01:13:09.885
YOUR SUMMARY SO THAT THESE

01:13:09.952 --> 01:13:13.722
PRODUCTION SAY THAT THE ODD

01:13:13.789 --> 01:13:15.290
NUMBER OF. RESIDENTIAL CARE

01:13:15.357 --> 01:13:16.692
BEDS ARE PROJECTED TO GO DOWN

01:13:16.759 --> 01:13:18.560
FROM THIRTY THREE THOUSAND

01:13:18.627 --> 01:13:20.562
TODAY TO NINETEEN THOUSAND AND

01:13:20.629 --> 01:13:22.097
TWENTY FORTY. AND THAT NURSING

01:13:22.164 --> 01:13:23.432
HOME CARE IS EXPECTED TO GO

01:13:23.499 --> 01:13:25.434
DOWN FROM FOURTEEN THOUSAND

01:13:25.501 --> 01:13:28.103
TODAY. TO EIGHT THOUSAND AND

01:13:28.170 --> 01:13:31.106
TWENTY FORTY. ARE THESE IS IN

01:13:31.173 --> 01:13:31.774
MY READING THESE NUMBERS

01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:33.008
CORRECTLY ARE THESE ARE

01:13:33.075 --> 01:13:34.777
PROJECTIONS FOR THE NUMBER OF

01:13:34.843 --> 01:13:37.279
BEDS THAT WE NEED TO PLAN FOR

01:13:37.346 --> 01:13:38.480
OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT

01:13:38.547 --> 01:13:40.015
TWENTY YEARS SO- THIS THIS WAS

01:13:40.082 --> 01:13:41.283
DEVELOPED AS IT SO THERE THERE

01:13:41.350 --> 01:13:42.618
ARE A LOT OF LIMITATIONS IN

01:13:42.684 --> 01:13:44.787
VETERAN SPECIFIC DATA- AND WHAT

01:13:44.853 --> 01:13:45.788
WE IDENTIFY WHICH IS BASICALLY

01:13:45.854 --> 01:13:47.756
WHAT THE IN. THE AT ALL CHAPTER

01:13:47.823 --> 01:13:49.158
FOUR IS ABOUT HIS UNDERSTANDING

01:13:49.224 --> 01:13:51.226
THAT- YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T TAKE

01:13:51.293 --> 01:13:52.995
A NON VETERAN. OF A CERTAIN AGE

01:13:53.061 --> 01:13:54.830
CERTAIN GENEROUS CETERA AND

01:13:54.897 --> 01:13:55.798
TAKE A VETERAN WITH ALL THE

01:13:55.864 --> 01:13:57.132
SAME CHARACTERISTICS AND ASSUME

01:13:57.199 --> 01:13:57.766
THAT THE CARE NEEDS ARE

01:13:57.833 --> 01:14:00.769
SIMILAR- SO THIS DATA THAT'S ON

01:14:00.836 --> 01:14:03.305
HERE- THIS IS A- IN MY OPINION

01:14:03.372 --> 01:14:05.574
VERY LOW ESTIMATE- IS SUING

01:14:05.641 --> 01:14:07.576
THAT'S- IF VETERANS HAD THE

01:14:07.643 --> 01:14:09.411
SAME. CARE NEEDS AS NON

01:14:09.478 --> 01:14:11.079
VETERANS THIS WOULD BE THE

01:14:11.146 --> 01:14:12.481
FLOOR THIS WE HOW MANY-

01:14:12.548 --> 01:14:14.449
VETERANS WHO EXPECT ME CARE. ON

01:14:14.516 --> 01:14:15.851
THE RALLY IS BECAUSE WE

01:14:15.918 --> 01:14:17.920
RECOGNIZE A VETERANS HAVE

01:14:17.986 --> 01:14:18.654
GREATER CARE NEEDS IN GENERAL

01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:20.222
MORE LIKELY NEED LONG TERM CARE

01:14:20.289 --> 01:14:21.456
THAT THEY'RE TRUE NUMBERS

01:14:21.523 --> 01:14:22.925
PROBABLY HIGHER THAN IT. IS

01:14:22.991 --> 01:14:24.927
OUTSIDE THEIR TABLE THAT HAS

01:14:24.993 --> 01:14:26.395
THOSE PROJECTIONS SOMEWHERE BUT

01:14:26.461 --> 01:14:28.030
WE DON'T HAVE SPECIFIC PROJECTS

01:14:28.096 --> 01:14:28.864
ON THE AND THAT'S THAT THAT

01:14:28.931 --> 01:14:30.065
SPEAKS TO THE LIMITATIONS ON

01:14:30.132 --> 01:14:31.366
GETTING VETERAN SPECIFIC LONG

01:14:31.433 --> 01:14:33.602
TERM CAREDATA. I'M SO AGAIN WE

01:14:33.669 --> 01:14:34.403
CAN RECOGNIZE THAT SAYS THIS IS

01:14:34.469 --> 01:14:36.872
A MINIMUM- IT'S GOING TO BE

01:14:36.939 --> 01:14:38.507
SOME NUMBER HIGHER THAN THIS-

01:14:38.574 --> 01:14:41.076
BUT EITHER WAY IF YOU LOOK AT

01:14:41.143 --> 01:14:41.777
NINETEEN THOUSAND HOW MANY

01:14:41.844 --> 01:14:43.879
RESIDENTS CARE TWENTY FORTY

01:14:43.946 --> 01:14:45.013
EIGHT THOUSAND NAY OF NON OF

01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:46.114
NURSING HOME CARE AND TWENTY

01:14:46.181 --> 01:14:48.584
FORTY- CONCERN WILL HAVE TWENTY

01:14:48.650 --> 01:14:50.919
THREE HUNDRED- AT TWENTY.

01:14:50.986 --> 01:14:52.287
TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY BEDS

01:14:52.354 --> 01:14:53.422
OBVIOUSLY WE'RE NOT WE WOULD BE

01:14:53.488 --> 01:14:56.291
ABLE TO COME EIGHT- ALL THESE

01:14:56.358 --> 01:14:58.260
VETERANS REGARDLESS SO THAT THE

01:14:58.327 --> 01:15:00.863
REALITY IS WHAT WE'VE- AS

01:15:00.929 --> 01:15:02.598
SACRAMENTO WERE WERE HOPING TO

01:15:02.664 --> 01:15:04.233
DO IS. SHIFT OUR FOCUS SHIP THE

01:15:04.299 --> 01:15:08.303
RESOURCES MAKE SURE WE'RE WERE

01:15:08.370 --> 01:15:10.572
WERE USED FOR USING THE

01:15:10.639 --> 01:15:13.342
RESOURCES THE BEST CAN AND FOLK.

01:15:13.408 --> 01:15:20.349
ON A ON VETERANS. PROBABLY JUST

01:15:20.415 --> 01:15:22.584
TO GET THEM A- WHICH IS ALMOST.

01:15:22.651 --> 01:15:23.118
DOES THIS TIE SEARCH CAN.

01:15:23.185 --> 01:15:24.553
GETTING I'M IN THE OTHER THING

01:15:24.620 --> 01:15:26.021
THAT WE'VE WE PRIORITIZE

01:15:26.088 --> 01:15:27.122
PREVIOUS YEARS WITH ALLEGE.

01:15:27.189 --> 01:15:29.391
ASSISTANCE OKAY AND THEN. I WON

01:15:29.458 --> 01:15:29.925
THING I WOULD FIND HELPFUL

01:15:29.992 --> 01:15:30.959
MIGHT ARE EXIST IS SOME KIND OF

01:15:31.026 --> 01:15:31.860
ROUGH. PROJECTION OF A YOU

01:15:31.927 --> 01:15:32.895
THINK KIND OF THE DEMAND REALLY

01:15:32.961 --> 01:15:34.263
IS GOING TO BE OVER THE COURSE

01:15:34.329 --> 01:15:36.131
OF THE NEXT. TEN YEARS AND THEN

01:15:36.198 --> 01:15:37.799
YOU GIVEN THE RESOURCES WE HAVE

01:15:37.866 --> 01:15:39.034
HOW MUCH OF THAT DEMAND YOU

01:15:39.101 --> 01:15:39.835
ACTUALLY THINK WE'RE GOING TO

01:15:39.902 --> 01:15:41.670
BE ABLE. TO MEET BECAUSE I

01:15:41.737 --> 01:15:43.038
THINK UNDERSTANDING. THAT

01:15:43.105 --> 01:15:45.240
DISCONNECT AND NOT. HOW BIG

01:15:45.307 --> 01:15:46.475
THAT FUNDING SHORTFALL IS

01:15:46.541 --> 01:15:48.176
REALLY IMPORTANT AS WE AS WE

01:15:48.243 --> 01:15:51.246

ALZHEIMER'S THAN US VIETNAM

VETERANS WHOA THAT'S RIGHT. SO.

01:28:19.827 --> 01:28:23.531
AS A VETERAN I HAVE TO QUESTION

01:28:23.598 --> 01:28:26.167
BECAUSE I'M AN ANALYTICAL NERD

01:28:26.234 --> 01:28:28.269
I MEAN HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE A

01:28:28.336 --> 01:28:33.574
RULER IN THEIR POCKET. SHOULD

01:28:33.641 --> 01:28:36.411
WE BE IN THE BUSINESS OF

01:28:36.477 --> 01:28:39.113
VETERANS HOMES AND THINGS NO

01:28:39.180 --> 01:28:41.349
THAT'S GUTSY TO SAY BECAUSE I

01:28:41.416 --> 01:28:43.618
WOULD ALIENATE EVERY VETERAN

01:28:43.685 --> 01:28:47.922
THEN I KNOW. SO WE HAVE TO AND

01:28:47.989 --> 01:28:49.891
YOU'VE DONE A WONDERFUL

01:28:49.957 --> 01:28:53.528
ANALYSIS OF THIS. SO EVERYTHING

01:28:53.594 --> 01:28:55.530
IS EVOLUTIONARY IN CALIFORNIA

01:28:55.596 --> 01:29:01.035
SHOULD WE- DO IT EVOLUTION TO

01:29:01.102 --> 01:29:03.705
NOT PROVIDE BEDS TO THE

01:29:03.771 --> 01:29:07.408
HOMELESS. AND GO TO WHAT BEDS

01:29:07.475 --> 01:29:11.079
WE HAVE. FOR THE BRAIN INJURED

01:29:11.145 --> 01:29:16.417
AND THE DISABLED. OKAY. AND YOU

01:29:16.484 --> 01:29:19.253
YOU HAVE PUT THE ELEPHANT IN

01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:22.323
THE ROOM. PARDON ME I'M REALLY

01:29:22.390 --> 01:29:25.893
IN THE ELEPHANTS YOU KNOW. THAT

01:29:25.960 --> 01:29:30.298
IS. THAT IS A HIDDEN JOKE MADAM.

01:29:30.364 --> 01:29:34.068
MR SENATOR. SO BUT THE POINT

01:29:34.135 --> 01:29:38.573
I'M MAKING IS. FROM MY NUMBERS

01:29:38.639 --> 01:29:40.675
AND WHAT I UNDERSTAND AND

01:29:40.742 --> 01:29:42.677
ANYONE CAN GOOGLE BEING

01:29:42.744 --> 01:29:44.946
CALIFORNIA PROVIDES MORE

01:29:45.012 --> 01:29:47.348
VETERANS BENEFITS IN OUR HOMES

01:29:47.415 --> 01:29:49.517
I THINK IT'S AROUND THREE

01:29:49.584 --> 01:29:50.151
HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION IS THAT

01:29:50.218 --> 01:29:53.488
CORRECT MISTER SECRETARY. AND I

01:29:53.554 --> 01:29:55.089
ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT'S MORE

01:29:55.156 --> 01:29:57.558
THAN FORTY SEVEN OTHER STATES

01:29:57.625 --> 01:30:02.630
COMBINED. SO MUCH THERE'S NO

01:30:02.697 --> 01:30:04.699
QUESTION THE CALIFORNIA

01:30:04.766 --> 01:30:07.135
SUPPORTS VETERANS BUT IT'S HOW

01:30:07.201 --> 01:30:11.038
WE SUPPORT THEM IN THIS REPORT.

01:30:11.105 --> 01:30:16.544
IS SPOT ON. 87% MY OPINION IT'S

01:30:16.611 --> 01:30:19.580
GREAT SO WHAT'S INTERESTING TO

01:30:19.647 --> 01:30:22.784
ME IS WE HAVE ONE POINT SEVEN A

01:30:22.850 --> 01:30:23.651
ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION

01:30:23.718 --> 01:30:25.486
VETERANS WE HAVE A LIMITED

01:30:25.553 --> 01:30:28.122
AMOUNT OF BEDS IN THE VETERANS

01:30:28.189 --> 01:30:32.493
HOMES FOR WHATEVER REASON. AND

01:30:32.560 --> 01:30:34.195
BASICALLY WERE RUNNING A

01:30:34.262 --> 01:30:36.531
LOTTERY FOR VETERANS MAN IF YOU

WHAT A DEAL. SOME. ANOTHER

01:30:43.871 --> 01:30:47.375
THING THIS. COMMITTEE NEEDS TO

01:30:47.441 --> 01:30:51.546
CONSIDER IS HOW DO WE- REQUIRE

01:30:51.612 --> 01:30:56.450
WAR. ADMIT VETERANS TO OUR

01:30:56.517 --> 01:30:59.554

VA IS INTENT AND IS THAT THAT.

01:36:48.669 --> 01:36:50.538
COVERS ALL OF THEIR CARE SO WE

REVENUE SOURCES FOR THAT PERSON

01:36:56.010 --> 01:36:57.811
BECAUSE- THAT IS INTENDED TO BE

01:36:57.878 --> 01:36:59.947
THE- THE ENTIRE COST OF THEIR

01:37:00.014 --> 01:37:02.283

DELTA THERE. AND OF COURSE IT

01:37:08.789 --> 01:37:11.592
DEPENDS- ALMOST PERSON A PERSON

01:37:11.659 --> 01:37:13.594
BECAUSE- PEOPLE'S MEMBER FEES

01:37:13.661 --> 01:37:15.262
ARE AS YOU KNOW ARE BASED ON

01:37:15.329 --> 01:37:18.566
THEIR INCOME AS OPPOSED TO-

01:37:18.632 --> 01:37:19.800

THEY'RE GETTING IN THE WAY OF

01:37:24.438 --> 01:37:24.905
CARE. BUT THERE MEMBER THE

BASED ON. ON THEIR INCOME SO.

01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:27.208
AND OF COURSE THE

01:37:27.274 --> 01:37:28.909
REIMBURSEMENTS ARE BASED ON

01:37:28.976 --> 01:37:29.777
WHAT. THAT CARE THEY'RE BEING

01:37:29.843 --> 01:37:31.579
PROVIDED SO THERE IS. A DELTA

01:37:31.645 --> 01:37:33.013
BUT IT'S NOT IN. A SET. THAT I

01:37:33.080 --> 01:37:34.415
COULD STATE FOR YOU BECAUSE IT

01:37:34.481 --> 01:37:36.784
DEPENDS SYSTEM VETERANS PAY TO.

01:37:36.850 --> 01:37:40.120

01:38:47.988 --> 01:38:49.823
CHOOSE TO LIVE IN OUR VETERANS

01:38:49.890 --> 01:38:51.258
FACILITY BECAUSE THEY WANT TO

01:38:51.325 --> 01:38:53.694
BE AROUND OTHER VETERANS. OR

01:38:53.761 --> 01:38:56.697
FOR SOME OTHER NINE. HOUSING

01:38:56.764 --> 01:38:58.766
NEED RELATED CORRECT ME IF I'M

01:38:58.832 --> 01:39:01.535
WRONG 25% OF ALL THE ADMISSIONS

01:39:01.602 --> 01:39:02.169
THE LAST TWO YEARS OF THE HOMES

01:39:02.236 --> 01:39:06.173
ARE HOMELESS. THEY DO NOT HAVE.

01:39:06.240 --> 01:39:08.709
AN ABILITY SOME OF THEM TO PAY

01:39:08.776 --> 01:39:11.178
THE COST OF THEIR CARE. OKAY

01:39:11.245 --> 01:39:12.946
AND THEN GIVEN THE CONVERSATION

01:39:13.013 --> 01:39:13.647
THAT WE'VE HAD IN THIS ORDER

01:39:13.714 --> 01:39:15.783
CENTER I'M SORRY ALSO THE FIRES

01:39:15.849 --> 01:39:17.318
THAT BURNED UP NORTH BURNED A

01:39:17.384 --> 01:39:18.952
LOT OF OUR MORTGAGE SHE'S OUT

01:39:19.019 --> 01:39:20.888

01:39:20.954 --> 01:39:22.122
AGAIN OTHERS WE TOOK INTO THE

01:39:22.189 --> 01:39:24.625
HOME RIGHT. AND I'VE CERTAINLY

01:39:24.692 --> 01:39:26.327
QUESTION IN THE PAST DURING MY

01:39:26.393 --> 01:39:27.995
ALMOST EIGHT YEARS HERE ABOUT

01:39:28.062 --> 01:39:31.765
WHY WE. PROVIDE A ROOMING

01:39:31.832 --> 01:39:32.933
SERVICE FOR VETERANS I

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.102
UNDERSTAND IN THE DESERT DESIRE

01:39:35.169 --> 01:39:36.537
FOR VETERANS TO BE AROUND OTHER

01:39:36.603 --> 01:39:37.938
VETERANS AND I THINK THAT'S A

01:39:38.005 --> 01:39:39.840
VALUABLE REASON TO DO

01:39:39.907 --> 01:39:41.809
CONTINUING TO DO WHAT WE DO WE

01:39:41.875 --> 01:39:43.544
JUST NEED TO REALIZE WHAT IT IS

01:39:43.610 --> 01:39:45.346
BUT GIVEN THE CONVERSATION THAT

ELIMINATING DHAMMA CELERY BEDS.

01:40:03.263 --> 01:40:07.234
CAUSES ME SOME CONCERN. HOW HOW

01:40:07.301 --> 01:40:10.404
MUCH OF A VOUCHER WOULD WE NEED

01:40:10.471 --> 01:40:11.171

UNNECESSARY CRITERIA OR

01:49:44.778 --> 01:49:46.646
PROCESSES IN PLACE WHEN IT

01:49:46.713 --> 01:49:47.647
COMES TO THE STATE HIRING

01:49:47.714 --> 01:49:48.715
PROCESS THAT COULD BE

01:49:48.782 --> 01:49:51.117
ALLEVIATED. AND IN SOME WAYS

01:49:51.184 --> 01:49:52.819
HELP SOME OF THESE HOMES- BUT

01:49:52.886 --> 01:49:55.555
ALSO A COULD THE DEPARTMENT

01:49:55.622 --> 01:49:59.659
REPORT BCK TO THE LEGISLATURE.

01:49:59.726 --> 01:50:00.860
TO RETENTION CHALLENGE AT THE

01:50:00.927 --> 01:50:02.896
WHOLE LEVEL SO IT COULD BE

01:50:02.963 --> 01:50:04.064
SOMETHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:50:04.130 --> 01:50:05.932
TO CONSIDER WHEN LOOKING AT THE

01:50:05.999 --> 01:50:08.401
WHEN I'M THINKING ABOUT SHINS

01:50:08.468 --> 01:50:09.536
FOR THE ANNUAL BUDGET PROCESS.

01:50:09.602 --> 01:50:10.403
FOR EXAMPLE SOMETHING THAT

01:50:10.470 --> 01:50:11.738
COULD BE CONSIDERED IT IS

01:50:11.805 --> 01:50:15.842
PROVIDING TARGETED HIRING EVERY

01:50:15.909 --> 01:50:18.678
INCH AND FUNDS TO CERTAIN HOMES

01:50:18.745 --> 01:50:19.946
FOR THE POSITIONS THAT ARE VERY

01:50:20.013 --> 01:50:25.218
DIFFICULT TO FILL. I SO WITH

01:50:25.285 --> 01:50:26.753
THAT. I AFTER THE POP. OF OUR

01:50:26.820 --> 01:50:27.954
WORK. AS A TO THE SEVENTEEN

01:50:28.021 --> 01:50:29.322
EIGHTEEN BY THE- MADE AN FROM.

01:50:29.389 --> 01:50:31.424
BUT TRY TO GET AT CHANGING THE

01:50:31.491 --> 01:50:33.660
VETERANS HOMES. ONE OF THEM WAS

01:50:33.727 --> 01:50:36.029
CONVERTING TRANSITIONAL-

01:50:36.096 --> 01:50:37.964

ANGELES AND VENTURA COUNTY HOME

01:50:42.202 --> 01:50:43.636
AND THEN ANOTHER WAS EXPANDING

01:50:43.703 --> 01:50:46.873
THE PRIORITIZATION CRITERIA TO

01:50:46.940 --> 01:50:48.975
VETERANS WITH THE 70% OR HIGHER

01:50:49.042 --> 01:50:50.910
SERVICE CONNECTED DISABILITY.

01:50:50.977 --> 01:50:53.046
AND BOTH PROPOSALS WERE PROVED

01:50:53.113 --> 01:50:54.481
BUT I THINK THEY ALSO SERVES TO

01:50:54.547 --> 01:50:55.715
CONTINUE THIS BROADER

01:50:55.782 --> 01:50:58.018
CONVERSATION OF OLD WHAT WHAT'S

01:50:58.084 --> 01:50:59.586
THE ULTIMATE VISION OF THE

01:50:59.652 --> 01:51:01.788

MASTER PLAN INCLUDED. FOLLOW UP

01:51:17.737 --> 01:51:19.806
ANALYSIS ON HOW THE NEW

01:51:19.873 --> 01:51:21.541
ADMISSION POLICIES WOULD AFFECT

01:51:21.608 --> 01:51:23.410
OTHER VETERANS THE OPERATIONS

WITH THE HOMES. OF AND

01:51:44.164 --> 01:51:46.433
EVALUATION OF LEASES AT THE

01:51:46.499 --> 01:51:49.002

EIGHTEEN THE PLEDGES FOR. BY

01:51:59.245 --> 01:52:00.180
EXPECTATIONS OF MASTER. BY MORE

01:52:00.246 --> 01:52:03.016
COME. LIKE ASSESSING THE NEED

OR EVEN OPEN MORE FACILITIES

01:52:08.321 --> 01:52:10.457
BASED OFF OF THE FINDINGS OF

01:52:10.523 --> 01:52:12.225
HOW THE CHANGING NEEDS OF

01:52:12.292 --> 01:52:13.960
VETERANS WOULD LOOK LIKE.

01:52:14.027 --> 01:52:15.562
CONSIDER WAYS OF PROVIDING

01:52:15.628 --> 01:52:17.430
SERVICES THROUGH DIFFERENT

CARE SERVICE DELIVERY MODELS

01:52:21.201 --> 01:52:22.836
THAT WOULD ALLOW VETERANS TO

01:52:22.902 --> 01:52:24.537
AGE IN PLACE. AND RECEIVE

01:52:24.604 --> 01:52:26.739
SERVICES WITHIN THEIR EXISTING

ADDITIONALLY THE LEGISLATURE

01:52:39.719 --> 01:52:41.488
THEY CLARIFIED THEIR DESIRE TO

01:52:41.554 --> 01:52:42.789
HAVE THE MASTER PLAN BE A

01:52:42.856 --> 01:52:45.258
LIVING DOCUMENT AND WITH THAT-

01:52:45.325 --> 01:52:47.127
REQUIRED THAT THE MASTER PLAN

YEARS UPON THE INITIAL RELEASE.

01:52:52.365 --> 01:52:53.199
SO NOW THAT I SET UP THAT

01:52:53.266 --> 01:52:55.301
BACKGROUND- ALL MOVE INTO A

01:52:55.368 --> 01:52:58.872
KIND OF THE KEY QUESTIONS THAT-

01:52:58.938 --> 01:53:00.640
WE- WE WOULD SUGGEST THE

01:53:00.707 --> 01:53:02.142
LEGISLATURE KEEPS IN MIND AS

01:53:02.208 --> 01:53:03.309
THEIR PROCESSING THE FINDINGS

01:53:03.376 --> 01:53:05.011
AND RECOMMENDATIONS AGAIN WE'RE

01:53:05.078 --> 01:53:07.213
STILL ANALYZING THE MASTER PLAN

01:53:07.280 --> 01:53:08.848
SO WHILE OUR- COMMENTS CAN'T

01:53:08.915 --> 01:53:11.985
CPAS CAN'T- ART SPECIFIC TO

01:53:12.051 --> 01:53:14.220
THE- PROCESSES OF THE

01:53:14.287 --> 01:53:15.955
RECOMMENDATIONS HOPEFULLY WE

01:53:16.022 --> 01:53:16.556
COULD GET. TO THAT AT A LATER

01:53:16.623 --> 01:53:19.559
DATE- SO THE FIRST QUESTION

01:53:19.626 --> 01:53:21.661
THAT WE WOULD RAISE IS WHAT

01:53:21.728 --> 01:53:23.496
PREDICTIONS DOES THE MAP MASTER

01:53:23.563 --> 01:53:26.799
PLAN MAKE AND HOW- IN HOW THE

01:53:26.866 --> 01:53:28.101
NEEDS OF VETERANS WILL CHANGE

01:53:28.168 --> 01:53:30.203
OVER TIME AND- AS WAS

01:53:30.270 --> 01:53:32.605
MENTIONED- IT'S IT SOUNDS LIKE

01:53:32.672 --> 01:53:34.908
THE- PROJECTIONS WERE CROSS

01:53:34.974 --> 01:53:36.342
CUTTING AND THAT THEY BOTH

01:53:36.409 --> 01:53:37.810
LOOKED AT. THE GENERAL

01:53:37.877 --> 01:53:39.679
POPULATION OF VETERANS BUT THEN

01:53:39.746 --> 01:53:41.781
ALSO THE NEEDS OF SUB GROUPS

01:53:41.848 --> 01:53:43.383
THOSE WITH COMPLEX BEHAVIORAL

01:53:43.449 --> 01:53:44.784
HEALTH NEEDS THOSE EXPERIENCING

01:53:44.851 --> 01:53:48.555
HOMELESSNESS. AND ON PIECE WERE

01:53:48.621 --> 01:53:50.056
STILL PROCESSING IN TRYING TO

01:53:50.123 --> 01:53:51.558
UNDERSTAND TO THE DATA THAT WAS

01:53:51.624 --> 01:53:52.926
USED TO CONSTRUCT THESE

01:53:52.992 --> 01:53:55.495
PRODUCTIONS AND TO ASSESS THEIR

01:53:55.562 --> 01:53:57.497
PORTABILITY TO CALIFORNIA.

01:53:57.564 --> 01:53:59.232
ANOTHER QUESTION THAT THE

01:53:59.299 --> 01:53:59.866
LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO KEEP IN

01:53:59.933 --> 01:54:02.035
MIND AS- FOR EACH OF THESE

01:54:02.101 --> 01:54:03.937
RECOMMENDATIONS AND FINDINGS

01:54:04.003 --> 01:54:05.338
DOES THE MASTER PLAN LAID OUT A

01:54:05.405 --> 01:54:07.674
CLEAR PATH FORWARD ON WHAT

01:54:07.740 --> 01:54:08.775
ABOUT THE VETERANS HOME

01:54:08.841 --> 01:54:10.009
SPECIFICALLY WOULD HAVE TO

01:54:10.076 --> 01:54:12.445
CHANGE TO BETTER MEET THE NEEDS

01:54:12.512 --> 01:54:15.114
OF VETERANS IN THE FUTURE- AND

01:54:15.181 --> 01:54:16.950
IF NOT IS THAT SOMETHING THAT

01:54:17.016 --> 01:54:18.551
COULD BE FURTHER EXPLORED OR

01:54:18.618 --> 01:54:20.420
TEASE DOUBT AND FUTURE

01:54:20.486 --> 01:54:22.989
ITERATIONS. OF THE MASTER PLAN.

01:54:23.056 --> 01:54:25.225
ANOTHER QUESTION IS WITH ALL OF

NECESSARY RESOURCES- TO DO SO.

01:54:39.005 --> 01:54:40.240
I HOW WILL THE ADMINISTRATION

01:54:40.306 --> 01:54:42.175
USED THE RECOMMENDATIONS AND

01:54:42.242 --> 01:54:44.177
FINDINGS IN THE MASTER PLAN TO

01:54:44.244 --> 01:54:46.145
DIE TO THEIR FUTURE BUDGET AND

01:54:46.212 --> 01:54:48.348
POLICY WORK. AND WHAT'S THE

01:54:48.414 --> 01:54:50.683
ROLE FOR THE LEGISLATURE IN

01:54:50.750 --> 01:54:52.518

THE LEGISLATURE HOW CAN THE

01:54:59.659 --> 01:55:01.361
LEGISLATURE USE THE MASTER PLAN

01:55:01.427 --> 01:55:02.762
TO ALSO ELEVATE THEIR

01:55:02.829 --> 01:55:04.197
PRIORITIES AND WHAT THEY WANT

01:55:04.264 --> 01:55:05.632

OUT OF THE SERVICES PROVIDED

01:55:08.968 --> 01:55:11.938
THROUGH CAL BUT IN GENERAL- AND

01:55:12.005 --> 01:55:13.506
AGAIN THIS COULD BE SOMETHING

01:55:13.573 --> 01:55:16.809
THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD-

01:55:16.876 --> 01:55:18.678
ADDED INTO FUTURE ITERATIONS OF

01:55:18.745 --> 01:55:20.446

01:55:33.092 --> 01:55:34.460
GETS AT THAT HOUSING THE BUT

01:55:34.527 --> 01:55:37.497
IT'S A DIFFERENT SERVICE MODEL.

01:55:37.563 --> 01:55:40.266
I'M I'M ASSEMBLY MEMBER YOU

THAT THE PLAN IS SPECIFIC TO

VETERANS OWNS BUT IS THAT

01:55:47.273 --> 01:55:48.107
SOMETHING THAT COULD BE

01:55:48.174 --> 01:55:49.776
EXPLORED AND FUTURE ITERATIONS

AND LASTLY I WOULD KNOW THAT-

01:55:59.052 --> 01:56:00.653
THERE'S THIS BROADER QUESTION

01:56:00.720 --> 01:56:02.555
OF HOW DOES THE MASTER PLAN

01:56:02.622 --> 01:56:04.357

THAT THE- THE LEGISLATURE AND

01:56:08.061 --> 01:56:09.162

CONSTRUCTING A MASTER PLAN FOR

01:56:15.101 --> 01:56:17.303
AGING AND THIS IS A BROAD LOOK

01:56:17.370 --> 01:56:19.472
ON. HOW HOW ARE WE REALIGNING

01:56:19.539 --> 01:56:23.242
STATE PROGRAMS- LOCAL PROGRAMS

01:56:23.309 --> 01:56:24.944

THE MASTER PLAN CALVET SO

01:56:32.785 --> 01:56:34.120
THERE'S JUST A QUESTION OF HOW

01:56:34.187 --> 01:56:35.455
THEY WILL. INTERACT WITH ONE

01:56:35.521 --> 01:56:37.357

THE SUPPLY OF HOUSING SO HOW

01:56:45.732 --> 01:56:47.266
DOES THAT ALSO INTERPLAY WITH

AT THAT POPULATION CONTINUES TO

02:06:17.069 --> 02:06:18.904

YOU THAT THE AND IT WAS THE

02:06:52.771 --> 02:06:53.205
LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION

02:06:53.272 --> 02:06:56.475
SUGGESTED THAT THE- ACOSTA SAYS

02:06:56.542 --> 02:06:57.743
WOULD NOT BE BASED ON INCOME

02:06:57.810 --> 02:06:59.812
BUT ON COSTS OF CARE IS THAT IS

02:06:59.878 --> 02:07:01.180
THAT ACCURATE- THAT'S CORRECT

02:07:01.246 --> 02:07:02.815
YES AND WE DID NOT SPECIFY A

02:07:02.881 --> 02:07:04.783
PARTICULAR FORMULA BUT WE

02:07:04.850 --> 02:07:05.818
RECOMMEND TO THE COMMISSION

02:07:05.884 --> 02:07:07.987
RECOMMENDED THAT THE STATE MOVE

02:07:08.053 --> 02:07:09.888
FROM A PERCENTAGE OF INCOME TO

02:07:09.955 --> 02:07:12.191
A TO SOME FORMULA BASED ON COST

02:07:12.257 --> 02:07:14.093
OF CARE. BUT THE BUT THE

02:07:14.159 --> 02:07:16.795

JUST A COMMENT THAT WOULD

02:07:20.399 --> 02:07:21.700
TROUBLE ME GREATLY IF WE

02:07:21.767 --> 02:07:23.535
BASICALLY SKEWED SERVICES TO

02:07:23.602 --> 02:07:25.738
THOSE WHO ARE WEALTHIER VERSUS

02:07:25.804 --> 02:07:29.108
THOSE WHO ARE NOT- STE. FOR

02:07:29.174 --> 02:07:31.410
FUTURE CONSIDERATION OF. ALSO

02:07:31.477 --> 02:07:32.978
WORKED WITH AND- AGAIN I

02:07:33.045 --> 02:07:34.713
APOLOGIZE FOR BEING GONE FOR A

02:07:34.780 --> 02:07:36.448
PORTION OF THE HEARING- I NOTE

02:07:36.515 --> 02:07:37.950
FROM THE VARIOUS HOMES THAT ONE

02:07:38.017 --> 02:07:39.718
OF THE- ISSUES THAT SEEMS TO BE

02:07:39.785 --> 02:07:41.186
PREVALENT THROUGHOUT ALL THE

02:07:41.253 --> 02:07:42.287
HOMES IS THE ABILITY TO

02:07:42.354 --> 02:07:45.090
ATTRACT- EMPLOYEES WITH THE

02:07:45.157 --> 02:07:46.859
NECESSARY SKILLS TO BE ABLE TO.

02:07:46.925 --> 02:07:48.527
CARE FOR VETERANS IN THE WAY WE

02:07:48.594 --> 02:07:50.929
EXPECT THEM TO BE CARED FOR- IT

02:07:50.996 --> 02:07:53.032
HAD HAD ANY OF THE GROUPS LA-

02:07:53.098 --> 02:07:55.467
OR ANY OTHERS- CONSIDERED

02:07:55.534 --> 02:07:57.269
RECOMMENDING- SOME SORT OF COST

02:07:57.336 --> 02:07:59.171
OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT. BASED ON

02:07:59.238 --> 02:08:02.007
LOCALITY I MEAN WHAT WEST LA IS

02:08:02.074 --> 02:08:03.342
GOT TO BE VERY DIFFERENT THAN

02:08:03.409 --> 02:08:07.246
BARSTOW AND IF AND IF YOU HAVE

02:08:07.312 --> 02:08:07.813

02:08:13.619 --> 02:08:15.821
ISSUE OF HIRING A RETENTION AND

02:08:15.888 --> 02:08:17.022
ONE OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS IS

02:08:17.089 --> 02:08:19.591
THAT THE LEGISLATURE. COULD

02:08:19.658 --> 02:08:21.593
REQUIRE CALVET TO SUBMIT TO

02:08:21.660 --> 02:08:24.963

MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE FEDERAL

02:09:48.747 --> 02:09:50.415

DUMBEST SO REPROGRAM THE

02:10:10.736 --> 02:10:12.871
HISTORICALLY WE HAVE OPERATED

02:10:12.938 --> 02:10:14.273

02:10:33.225 --> 02:10:34.927

02:10:54.112 --> 02:10:57.316
HOUSING EXISTS- FOR THE MONEY

02:10:57.382 --> 02:10:58.650
THAT EITHER THE VETERANS HAVE

RIGHT IN I RECOGNIZE LAW THAT'S

MEET ALL THE DEMAND- THAT'S OUT

02:14:32.631 --> 02:14:34.232
THERE- BUT- I GUESS THE

02:14:34.299 --> 02:14:35.767
QUESTION FILIOQUE SHOULD POSE

02:14:35.834 --> 02:14:36.568
SOME QUESTIONS THAT WE OUGHT TO

02:14:36.635 --> 02:14:38.537
ASK GOING FORWARD. WHAT WILL

02:14:38.603 --> 02:14:39.137
HAS THE ASSEMBLY OR THE

02:14:39.204 --> 02:14:41.206
LEGISLAURE ASH SAY. PLATED AND

02:14:41.273 --> 02:14:43.008
PASSED LOCATION OF VETERANS

02:14:44.743 --> 02:14:46.611
VOTING FOR. VETERAN HOME BONDS

02:14:46.678 --> 02:14:47.946
BUT I DON'T. RECALL THAT BEING

02:14:48.013 --> 02:14:48.780
SPECIFIC TO WHERE WE GOT TO

02:14:48.847 --> 02:14:50.048
PLACE IT. I KNOW THERE'S THE

02:14:50.115 --> 02:14:51.650
VETOES FIVE RULES NOW SERVE

02:14:51.716 --> 02:14:52.851
THEY DON'T KNOW HOPEFULLY THAT

02:14:52.918 --> 02:14:54.119
WOULD IN. THERE WITH THE

02:14:54.186 --> 02:14:55.554
MISTAKES WILL BE MADE GOING FOR

02:14:55.620 --> 02:14:57.222
BUT- IS THERE LEGISLATIVE.

02:14:57.289 --> 02:15:00.258
REQUIREMENT BEFORE THE A HOME

02:15:00.325 --> 02:15:01.660
IS CITED OR IF THAT. WOULD AYE

02:15:01.726 --> 02:15:02.861
AYE MAGICAL CLOSURE WAS

02:15:02.928 --> 02:15:04.162
REQUIRED WOULD HAVE TO HAVE WE

02:15:04.229 --> 02:15:05.931
ARE. WEIGH IN ON THAT- BUT

02:15:05.997 --> 02:15:06.965
FUTURE SIGHTING OF HOMES IS

02:15:07.032 --> 02:15:08.400
THAT SOMETHING THAT WE GET TO

02:15:08.467 --> 02:15:09.367
DO IS AS SOON AS DECIDED BY

02:15:09.434 --> 02:15:11.570
OTHERS. I MEAN IT TIES TO ON

02:15:11.636 --> 02:15:13.171
THE QUESTIONS THAT RE RAISED IS

02:15:13.238 --> 02:15:14.439
HOW WILL THE DECISION MAKING

02:15:14.506 --> 02:15:15.373
PROCESS OF IMPLEMENTING THE

02:15:15.440 --> 02:15:16.708
FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF

02:15:16.775 --> 02:15:17.976
THIS MASTER PLAN ACTUALLY

02:15:18.043 --> 02:15:19.611
ROLLOUT BUT JUST IN OUR PRIOR

02:15:19.678 --> 02:15:21.713
EXPERIENCE MOST RECENTLY. THE

02:15:21.780 --> 02:15:24.349
PROPOSAL TO. CONSTRUCT A- NEW

02:15:24.416 --> 02:15:25.450
REPLACEMENT SKILLED NURSING

02:15:25.517 --> 02:15:27.018
FACILITY WITHIN YACHT BILL. IT

02:15:27.085 --> 02:15:28.286
SEEMS LIKE SOMETHING OF THAT

02:15:28.353 --> 02:15:29.788
SORT WOULD HAVE TO GO THROUGH

02:15:29.855 --> 02:15:31.690
THE BUDGET PROCESS SO THAT'S

02:15:31.756 --> 02:15:32.724
WHERE THE LEGISLATURE COULD.

02:15:32.791 --> 02:15:34.726
CONNECT BUT- IS THERE A WAY IN

02:15:34.793 --> 02:15:35.594
WHICH THE LEGISLATURE COULD

02:15:35.660 --> 02:15:38.230
PROVIDE. INSIGHTS FEED ACT

02:15:38.296 --> 02:15:39.564
THEIR PRIORITY WHAT THEIR

02:15:39.631 --> 02:15:41.633
THOUGHTS ARE BEFORE IT GETS TO

02:15:41.700 --> 02:15:43.702
THAT LEVEL AND THAT'S A- A

02:15:43.768 --> 02:15:45.337
QUESTION OF. THE PROCESS OF.

02:15:45.403 --> 02:15:46.771
HOW WILL THESE RECOMMENDATIONS

02:15:46.838 --> 02:15:48.106
BE MOVING AND WHERE WILL THE

02:15:48.173 --> 02:15:49.908
LEGISLATURE NOT WHAT STAGE WITH

02:15:49.975 --> 02:15:51.409

YEARS- SO THEORETICALLY THERE'S

02:15:57.182 --> 02:15:58.049
