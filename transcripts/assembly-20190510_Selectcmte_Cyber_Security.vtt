REALLY ARE FOCUSES ON ON SMALL

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.119
BUSINESSES TODAY AND AND HOW

00:04:13.186 --> 00:04:17.090
THEY ARE ABLE TO HOW THEY CAN

00:04:17.156 --> 00:04:18.858
BETTER PROTECT THEMSELVES.

00:04:18.925 --> 00:04:19.492
CYBERSECURITY IT'S BEEN IN THE

00:04:19.559 --> 00:04:20.159
HEADLINES MORE MORE IN THE PAST

00:04:20.226 --> 00:04:21.194
FEW YEARS WITH LARGE SCALE

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.162
BREACHES OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:25.198
TOUCHING MANY OF OUR LIVES.

00:04:25.264 --> 00:04:27.233
AND MANY OF US INTRODUCING MORE

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.235
CONNECTED DEVICES INTO OUR HOMES

00:04:29.302 --> 00:04:31.104
AND REPORT OF RUSSIAN HACKING

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:33.306
INTERFERENCE IN THE TWENTY

00:04:33.373 --> 00:04:34.874
SIXTEEN ELECTION.

00:04:34.941 --> 00:04:37.210
BUT CYBER SECURITY IS NOT A NEW

00:04:37.276 --> 00:04:39.345
ISSUE OF THE IMPORTANCE IT HAS

00:04:39.412 --> 00:04:41.080
BEEN A GROWING THREAT TO AS MORE

00:04:41.147 --> 00:04:42.949
OF US TO WHAT GOVERNMENTS DO AND

00:04:43.016 --> 00:04:44.817
MORE OF WHAT BUSINESSES DO

00:04:44.884 --> 00:04:46.919
DEPEND ON COMPUTERS.

00:04:46.986 --> 00:04:49.088
AND THE INTERNET TO INCREASE

00:04:49.155 --> 00:04:49.422
PRODUCTIVITY.

00:04:49.489 --> 00:04:51.324
OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS OF MY

00:04:51.391 --> 00:04:53.292
EFFORTS BOTH IN CALIFORNIA AND

00:04:53.359 --> 00:04:56.963
ACROSS THE UNITED STATES WITH

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:57.630
THE NATIONAL CONFERENCE OF STATE

00:04:57.697 --> 00:04:58.931
LEGISLATURES.

00:04:58.998 --> 00:05:00.867
I'VE SEEN THAT OUR WORK AT THE

00:05:00.933 --> 00:05:02.869
STATE LEVEL TO DEFEND AND BECOME

00:05:02.935 --> 00:05:04.971
RESILIENT IS BEING CONSISTENTLY

00:05:05.038 --> 00:05:06.873
OUTPACED BY HACKERS.

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:08.941
AND NATION STATES FINDING AND

00:05:09.008 --> 00:05:10.910
USING VULNERABILITIES TO

00:05:10.977 --> 00:05:12.879
UNDERMINE OUR SECURITY.

00:05:12.945 --> 00:05:13.546
WITH SO MUCH OF THE CONVERSATION

00:05:13.613 --> 00:05:15.415
BEING FOCUS ON HOW GOVERNMENTS

00:05:15.481 --> 00:05:17.316
AND LARGE BUSINESSES ARE BEING

00:05:17.383 --> 00:05:18.918
IMPACTED.

00:05:18.985 --> 00:05:20.753
I BECAME INCREASINGLY CONCERNED

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:22.889
WITH SMALL BUSINESSES THE TRUE.

00:05:22.955 --> 00:05:23.389
ECONOMIC ENGINES OF OUR

00:05:23.456 --> 00:05:24.991
COMMUNITY.

00:05:25.058 --> 00:05:27.126
AS OUR FIRST PANEL WILL DIVE

00:05:27.193 --> 00:05:29.028
DEEPER INTO THE CYBER THREATS

00:05:29.095 --> 00:05:30.963
THAT ARE BEING EXPLOITED TODAY.

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.132
THAT CYBER THREATS THAT ARE

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:34.867
BEING EXPLOITED TODAY DO NOT

00:05:34.934 --> 00:05:35.535
DISCRIMINATE ON THE BUSINESS THE

00:05:35.601 --> 00:05:37.270
SIZE OF THE BUSINESS ON THEIR

00:05:37.336 --> 00:05:39.305
LOCATION OR WHAT PRODUCTS OR

00:05:39.372 --> 00:05:40.873
SERVICES ARE BEING OFFERED.

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:43.142
MANY OF THE THREATS ARE BASED ON

00:05:43.209 --> 00:05:44.844
VULNERABILITIES IN THE SOFTWARE

00:05:44.911 --> 00:05:45.344
THAT IS WIDELY USED BY

00:05:45.411 --> 00:05:48.915
BUSINESSES BOTH LARGE AND SMALL.

00:05:48.981 --> 00:05:49.549
THOSE SEEKING TO EXPLOIT THOSE

00:05:49.615 --> 00:05:51.084
VULNERABILITIES OFTEN DO NOT

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:52.985
KNOW WHO OR WHAT THEIR HACKING

00:05:53.052 --> 00:05:55.021
UNTIL THEY ARE SUCCESSFUL.

00:05:55.088 --> 00:05:57.023
MANY OF THE HACKERS ARE USING

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:58.858
AUTOMATED TOOLS LITERALLY

00:05:58.925 --> 00:05:59.492
COMBING THE OPEN INTERNET FOR

00:05:59.559 --> 00:06:02.929
UNPREPARED NETWORKS AND DEVICES.

00:06:02.995 --> 00:06:05.231
THE MORE PASSIVE HACKERS DECIDE

00:06:05.298 --> 00:06:06.833
WHETHER STEALING THE INFORMATION

00:06:06.899 --> 00:06:07.433
FOR IDENTITY THEFT OR HOLDING

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.102
THE INFORMATION FOR RANSOM IS

00:06:09.168 --> 00:06:11.070
MORE LUCRATIVE OFTEN THEY DO

00:06:11.137 --> 00:06:12.872
BOTH.

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:15.007
OTHERS USE THEIR ACCESS TO

00:06:15.074 --> 00:06:15.641
INSERT THEMSELVES INTO BUSINESS

00:06:15.708 --> 00:06:18.878
TRANSACTIONS DIVERTING FAT FUNDS

00:06:18.945 --> 00:06:21.013
OR SENDING A RONIN YES COMMANDS

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:21.347
TO EMPLOYEES.

00:06:21.414 --> 00:06:23.316
THOSE OUTCOMES WHILE DISTRESSING

00:06:23.382 --> 00:06:25.084
FOR ANY BUSINESS ARE SPECIALLY

00:06:25.151 --> 00:06:27.153
HARMFUL FOR SMALL BUSINESSES AND

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.122
AND WE OFTEN HEAR THAT SMALL

00:06:29.188 --> 00:06:29.422
BUSINESSES.

00:06:29.489 --> 00:06:31.190
AFTER CLOSE AS A RESULT OF THE

00:06:31.257 --> 00:06:32.925
BIG BREACH.

00:06:32.992 --> 00:06:36.963
THE ABILITY TO PAY RANSOM WHICH

00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:38.998
IS STRONGLY DISCOURAGED BY NEW

00:06:39.065 --> 00:06:39.632
COMPUTERS OR DEVICES OR HIRE

00:06:39.699 --> 00:06:41.200
PROFESSIONAL RESPONSE TEAMS IS

00:06:41.267 --> 00:06:45.037
PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE AND AS I

00:06:45.104 --> 00:06:46.939
SAID OFTEN RESULTS IN THE

00:06:47.006 --> 00:06:48.775

00:06:49.442 --> 00:06:51.277
BEST AND MOST ECONOMICAL

CYBER ATTACK IS TO BE PREPARED.

00:06:56.849 --> 00:06:59.285

TRAINED TO DO SHOULD PICK UP THE

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:29.161

HAD TO HAVE THE FUNDS WIRED TO

00:13:27.706 --> 00:13:28.774
THEM.

00:13:28.841 --> 00:13:30.976
THAT SORT OF COMPROMISE IN TWO

00:13:31.043 --> 00:13:32.978
THOUSAND SEVENTEEN COST THE

00:13:33.045 --> 00:13:35.080
TAXPAYERS OF THIS STATE OVER

00:13:35.147 --> 00:13:35.648
FORTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS.

00:13:35.714 --> 00:13:39.385
AND HALF OF THAT FLOWS FORTY TWO

00:13:39.451 --> 00:13:41.320
MILLION DOLLARS ARE BELIEVED TO

00:13:41.387 --> 00:13:44.890
HAVE -- TARGETED A REAL ESTATE

00:13:44.957 --> 00:13:47.026
CONSUMERS JUST LIKE ME IN YOU

00:13:47.092 --> 00:13:47.593
NORMAL PEOPLE TRYING TO BUY

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:48.928
PROPERTY.

00:13:48.994 --> 00:13:51.330
AND THEY LOSE THEIR MONEY TO

00:13:51.397 --> 00:13:54.867
LIFESAVING SEARCHES WIRED OUT --

00:13:54.934 --> 00:13:55.534
THE ANOTHER CASE THAT WAS WORK

00:13:55.601 --> 00:13:57.036
BY THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S

00:13:57.102 --> 00:13:59.071
OFFICE INVOLVED -- ANOTHER

00:13:59.138 --> 00:14:00.839
SCAMPER SIMILAR TO THE FIRST

00:14:00.906 --> 00:14:02.841
CAMP THAT I TALKED ABOUT -- BUT

00:14:02.908 --> 00:14:05.044
AFTER THE FUNDS WERE WIRED OUT --

00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:07.313
KEEP THE INVESTIGATOR HILDRETH

00:14:07.379 --> 00:14:07.880
WE'LL TALK ABOUT THIS CASE A

00:14:07.947 --> 00:14:09.348
LITTLE BIT MORE BUT THE FUNDS

00:14:09.415 --> 00:14:11.116
WERE WIRED OUT INTO THAT OUT OF

00:14:11.183 --> 00:14:15.020
STATE BANK ACCOUNT -- THE PERSON

00:14:15.087 --> 00:14:15.621
THAT RECEIVE THOSE FUNDS THEN

00:14:15.688 --> 00:14:19.225
CONVERTED THOSE FUNDS INTO A

00:14:19.291 --> 00:14:20.926
CASHIER'S CHECKS NOT ONE BUT TWO

00:14:20.993 --> 00:14:23.028
CASHIERS CHECKS THAT WERE THEN

00:14:23.095 --> 00:14:25.030
PLACED INTO STANDARD US MAIL

00:14:25.097 --> 00:14:25.664
ACTUALLY TAKE A BACK FED EX.

00:14:25.731 --> 00:14:27.399
AND THEN SENT TO TWO DIFFERENT

00:14:27.466 --> 00:14:29.134
DESTINATIONS ELSEWHERE IN THE

00:14:29.201 --> 00:14:31.070
UNITED STATES.

00:14:31.136 --> 00:14:32.972
AND ONE THOSE -- PACKAGES

00:14:33.038 --> 00:14:35.307
ARRIVED AT THEIR DESTINATIONS

00:14:35.374 --> 00:14:36.909
THOSE DESTINATIONS WERE BIG

00:14:36.976 --> 00:14:37.309
POINT EXCHANGES.

00:14:37.376 --> 00:14:39.278
SO THE CRIMINAL WAS IN THE

00:14:39.345 --> 00:14:40.946
PROCESS LITERALLY UP TAKING.

00:14:41.013 --> 00:14:43.115
A CRIMINAL PROCEEDS THAT THEY

00:14:43.182 --> 00:14:44.750
HAD STOLEN FROM A SUCCESSFUL

00:14:44.817 --> 00:14:46.885
BUSINESS EMAIL COMPROMISE CAM

00:14:46.952 --> 00:14:47.453
AND THEN WE'RE LOOKING TO

00:14:47.519 --> 00:14:49.221
LAUNDER THAT MONEY FROM U. S.

00:14:49.288 --> 00:14:51.023
CURRENCY INTER CRYPTOCURRENCY

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:53.025
WHERE IT WOULD THEN ZERO

00:14:53.092 --> 00:14:53.592
DISAPPEAR INTO THE CRYPTO

00:14:53.659 --> 00:14:54.994
CURRENCY MARKETS.

00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:55.594
WHICH ARE NOT UNTRACEABLE BUT

00:14:55.661 --> 00:14:57.363
IT'S EXCEEDINGLY DIFFICULT TO

00:14:57.429 --> 00:15:03.168
TRACE THAT MONEY ONCE IT MOVES

00:15:03.235 --> 00:15:03.769
INTO THE CRYPTO CURRENCY ROUND

00:15:03.836 --> 00:15:04.069
[INAUDIBLE]

00:15:04.136 --> 00:15:04.803
SO.

00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:08.007
THE AS AS YOU ARE AWARE OF THIS

00:15:08.073 --> 00:15:08.540
IS JUST COULD SIGNIFICANT

00:15:08.607 --> 00:15:09.174
PROBLEM NOT JUST IN CALIFORNIA

00:15:09.241 --> 00:15:09.842
BUT ACROSS THE UNITED STATES --

00:15:09.908 --> 00:15:11.277
WORLDWIDE IT'S BILLIONS AND

00:15:11.343 --> 00:15:13.279
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS -- THERE IS

00:15:13.345 --> 00:15:16.815
NOT A FIRM TECHNOLOGY FIX FOR

00:15:16.882 --> 00:15:19.184
THIS PROBLEM -- OR I WORK IN THE

00:15:19.251 --> 00:15:20.953
REAL ESTATE FRAUD UNIT I WORK

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:21.654

REAL ESTATE FRAUD UNIT -- WE ARE

THE STATE THAT HAS A DEDICATED

00:15:27.026 --> 00:15:28.827
REAL ESTATE FRAUD UNIT AND WE

00:15:28.894 --> 00:15:29.395
ARE HERE TO INVESTIGATE AND

00:15:29.461 --> 00:15:32.798
PROSECUTE THESE TYPES OF CRIMES.

00:15:32.865 --> 00:15:35.034
AS PART OF MY MANDATE A TO

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:37.036
SPREAD AWARENESS OF BUSINESS

00:15:37.102 --> 00:15:38.904
EMAIL COMPROMISE SCAMS I TALKED

00:15:38.971 --> 00:15:39.371
TO A LOT OF REALTORS.

00:15:39.438 --> 00:15:42.908
AND WE TALKED TO REALTORS

00:15:42.975 --> 00:15:44.977
BECAUSE AS I SAID 50% OF BC

00:15:45.044 --> 00:15:46.945
SCAMS IN THIS STATE TARGET.

00:15:47.012 --> 00:15:47.513
CONSUMERS INVOLVED IN REAL

00:15:47.579 --> 00:15:49.114
ESTATE TRANSACTIONS.

00:15:49.181 --> 00:15:50.916
AND LAW ENFORCEMENT BELIEVES

00:15:50.983 --> 00:15:53.352
THAT THE THE MOST COMMON POINT

00:15:53.419 --> 00:15:56.989
OF PENETRATION THE BREACH FOR

00:15:57.056 --> 00:15:57.589
REAL ESTATE RELATED BUSINESS

00:15:57.656 --> 00:15:59.325
EMAIL COMPROMISE SCAMS ARE WITH

00:15:59.391 --> 00:16:01.026
REAL ESTATE PROFESSIONALS.

00:16:01.093 --> 00:16:02.795
AGENTS BROKERS.

00:16:02.861 --> 00:16:06.899
AND THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE.

00:16:06.965 --> 00:16:08.934
THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE

00:16:09.001 --> 00:16:11.003
BECAUSE AS YOU ARE AWARE -- THE

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:13.205
VAST MAJORITY OF REAL ESTATE

00:16:13.272 --> 00:16:15.074
PROFESSIONALS IN THE STATE OF

00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:15.674
CALIFORNIA OUR TEN NINETY NINE

00:16:15.741 --> 00:16:19.044
EMPLOYEES -- BROKERS AGENTS.

00:16:19.111 --> 00:16:21.313
AND THE PROBLEM WITH THAT THE

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:23.215
TECHNOLOGICAL PROBLEMS AT THAT

00:16:23.282 --> 00:16:25.317
PRESENTS FOR TACKLING BUSINESS

00:16:25.384 --> 00:16:27.019
EMAIL COMPROMISES THAT THEY DO

00:16:27.086 --> 00:16:28.987
NOT HAVE CENTRALIZED IT SUPPORT.

00:16:29.054 --> 00:16:30.889
THERE'S NO CENTRALIZED.

00:16:30.956 --> 00:16:33.125
COMPUTER PROFESSIONALS THAT ARE

00:16:33.192 --> 00:16:35.127
LOCKING DOWN THEIR NETWORKS

00:16:35.194 --> 00:16:36.862
MAKING SURE THAT THE OPERATING

00:16:36.929 --> 00:16:37.463
SYSTEMS ARE PATCHED THAT THEY

00:16:37.529 --> 00:16:40.933
HAVE TO DO IS TO LATEST UP YOU

00:16:40.999 --> 00:16:41.433
KNOW MALWARE THAT THEIR

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:42.801
FIREWALLS ARE PATCHED.

00:16:42.868 --> 00:16:43.435
THAT THEY ARE RUNNING THE MOST

00:16:43.502 --> 00:16:45.371
CURRENT BROWSERS WHATEVER THEY

00:16:45.437 --> 00:16:46.905
USE WHETHER IT'S INTERNET

00:16:46.972 --> 00:16:48.841
EXPLORER OR GOOGLE CHROME --

00:16:48.907 --> 00:16:51.276
BECAUSE THAT'S HOW CRIMINALS OR

00:16:51.343 --> 00:16:52.911
EXT TAKING ADVANTAGE BEEN.

00:16:52.978 --> 00:16:54.913
PERFORMING THESE BREACHES IS BY

00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:57.316
GOING INTO ON PACKED SYSTEMS.

00:16:57.383 --> 00:16:59.218
SO IT CREATES A SIGNIFICANT

00:16:59.284 --> 00:17:01.186
CHALLENGE BECAUSE NOT ALL REAL

00:17:01.253 --> 00:17:01.587
ESTATE AGENTS ARE

00:17:01.653 --> 00:17:02.921
TECHNOLOGICALLY SAVVY.

00:17:02.988 --> 00:17:05.190
I WAS VERY STRUCK WHEN I GAVE A

00:17:05.257 --> 00:17:06.859
PRESENTATION A FEW MONTHS AGO

00:17:06.925 --> 00:17:09.194
AND KEEP IN MIND REAL ESTATE

00:17:09.261 --> 00:17:09.795
PROFESSIONALS COME FROM ALL

00:17:09.862 --> 00:17:10.763
WALKS OF LIFE ALL BACKGROUND

00:17:10.829 --> 00:17:11.196
SUMMER TECHNOLOGY.

00:17:11.263 --> 00:17:13.098
A TECHNOLOGICALLY SAVVY MANY OR

00:17:13.165 --> 00:17:14.800
NOT.

00:17:14.867 --> 00:17:17.336
AND AN OLDER REAL ESTATE AGENT

00:17:17.403 --> 00:17:18.904
RAISED HER HAND SHE SAID HOW MY

00:17:18.971 --> 00:17:22.841
SUPPOSED -- TO MAKE SURE THAT MY

00:17:22.908 --> 00:17:23.509
OPERATING SYSTEMS UP TO STOP ON

00:17:23.575 --> 00:17:27.045
MY TABLET ON MY COMPUTER THAT

00:17:27.112 --> 00:17:28.814
I'M RUNNING UP YOU KNOW.

00:17:28.881 --> 00:17:29.481
TECHNOLOGY SECURITY SOFTWARE ON

00:17:29.548 --> 00:17:31.150
MY PHONE ONE I STILL HAVE TO

A NEW CONTACT TO MY PHONE.

00:17:38.891 --> 00:17:39.491
AND THAT REALLY UNDERSCORES THE

00:17:39.558 --> 00:17:41.160
NATURE OF THE PROBLEM IS.

00:17:41.226 --> 00:17:42.995

AND THEY ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF

00:17:46.932 --> 00:17:48.867
AFFORDABLE POPULATION THAT IS

00:17:48.934 --> 00:17:49.468
TYPICALLY NOT TECHNOLOGICALLY

00:17:49.535 --> 00:17:53.005

00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:49.507
TESTED WITH THIS IS HOW IT

00:26:49.574 --> 00:26:53.144
ALWAYS GOES -- THEY THEY'VE DONE

00:26:53.211 --> 00:26:55.146
IT FOR A BUNCH OF VARIOUS --

00:26:55.213 --> 00:26:57.148
WORLD LEADERS JUST SAID TO THE

00:26:57.215 --> 00:26:59.117
AS A PROOF OF CONCEPT.

00:26:59.184 --> 00:27:01.152
BUT HIS MOUTH BASICALLY WE CAN

00:27:01.219 --> 00:27:02.954
SEE FROM LEFT AND RIGHT HIS

00:27:03.021 --> 00:27:05.090
MOUTH IS MOVING THE SAME IN BOTH

00:27:05.156 --> 00:27:07.258
AND IT'S EASY TO TRICK SOMEBODY

00:27:07.325 --> 00:27:08.994
WITH THIS.

00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:09.627
I GOT A COUPLE MORE IDEAS IF YOU

00:27:09.694 --> 00:27:10.895
CAN.

00:27:10.962 --> 00:27:14.933
HE PUT THE OLD ONE BACK IN -- SO

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.202
THAT'S WHAT ONE EMAIL THE OTHER

00:27:17.268 --> 00:27:18.903
STYLE.

00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:22.941
THE OTHER ONE IS -- WORK AT HOME --

00:27:23.008 --> 00:27:25.010
MONEY BILLS A LOT OF COLLEGE

00:27:25.076 --> 00:27:26.878
STUDENTS GET HIT WITH THESE --

00:27:26.945 --> 00:27:27.412
BECAUSE THEY TRY TO MAKE A

00:27:27.479 --> 00:27:28.013
LITTLE EXTRA MONEY AND THEY'LL

00:27:28.079 --> 00:27:29.414
STILL FILL OUT A JOB APPLICATION

00:27:29.481 --> 00:27:31.316
THEY'LL DO A BACKGROUND CHECK

00:27:31.383 --> 00:27:33.018
SURPRISINGLY THEY'LL PASS.

00:27:33.084 --> 00:27:35.220
A LOT OF PEOPLE LEISURE VILLAGE

00:27:35.286 --> 00:27:37.222
GET THIS ONE TO TRYING ON A

00:27:37.288 --> 00:27:37.922
FIXED INCOME TRYING TO MAKE SOME

00:27:37.989 --> 00:27:39.190
EXTRA MONEY AND ALL THEY'RE

00:27:39.257 --> 00:27:41.159
DOING IS RECEIVING MONEY AND AND

00:27:41.226 --> 00:27:42.894
WIRING IT OUT SOMEWHERE ELSE IN

00:27:42.961 --> 00:27:43.228
THERE JUST.

00:27:43.294 --> 00:27:45.063
LAUNDERING STOLEN MONEY BUT THEY

00:27:45.130 --> 00:27:46.898
HAVE NO IDEA THEY THINK THEY'RE

00:27:46.965 --> 00:27:48.900
DOING A LEGITIMATE BUSINESS.

00:27:48.967 --> 00:27:50.869
AND SO I EXPLAIN BOTH OF THOSE

00:27:50.935 --> 00:27:51.369
TO COME TO THIS SLIDE.

00:27:51.436 --> 00:27:53.338
I HAD ONE WORK AT HOME -- VICTIM

00:27:53.405 --> 00:27:56.941

00:27:57.008 --> 00:27:57.575

00:27:57.642 --> 00:27:58.810
ROMANCE CAM VICTIM IN CAMARILLO

00:27:58.877 --> 00:28:00.812

CYBER BOYFRIEND TO WIRED TO

00:28:02.947 --> 00:28:03.415
THREE DIFFERENT PLACES IN

00:28:03.481 --> 00:28:03.715
WISCONSIN.

00:28:03.782 --> 00:28:05.183
SO HOW DO WE GET THAT MONEY BACK

00:28:05.250 --> 00:28:05.850
THIS IS WHERE WE NEED SOME FIXES

00:28:05.917 --> 00:28:09.154
BECAUSE THAT'S LIKE PUTTING

00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:09.754

00:28:09.821 --> 00:28:11.256

00:28:11.322 --> 00:28:12.957
CASH.

00:28:13.024 --> 00:28:13.391
AND IT MOVES FAST.

00:28:13.458 --> 00:28:15.226

00:53:25.402 --> 00:53:25.669
DOLLARS LOST.

00:53:25.735 --> 00:53:27.170
THIS IS AN ENTRY ARTICLE I JUST

00:53:27.237 --> 00:53:27.771
CAME ACROSS ACTUALLY PREPARING

00:53:27.837 --> 00:53:31.074
FOR THIS -- THEY PULLED A BUNCH

00:53:31.141 --> 00:53:32.876
OF SMALL BEATEN AND MEDIUM

00:53:32.943 --> 00:53:33.510
BUSINESS EXECUTIVES AND OWNERS

00:53:33.577 --> 00:53:34.945

LOCKED OUT YOUR YOU KNOW DATA

AND THE MAJORITY SAID ABSOLUTE

00:53:39.549 --> 00:53:41.318
YES I WOULD AND THAT IS WHY

00:53:41.384 --> 00:53:43.320
THESE CRIMINALS STILL HAVE A

00:53:43.386 --> 00:53:44.854
MARKET BECAUSE THEY KNOW HOW

00:53:44.921 --> 00:53:48.825
VALUABLE DATA IS.

00:53:48.892 --> 00:53:49.426
I JUST A FEW STEPS TO GO TO

00:53:49.492 --> 00:53:51.027
THESE ARE A LITTLE OLDER BUT IN

00:53:51.094 --> 00:53:51.628
THE BEGINNING A TWO THOUSAND

00:53:51.695 --> 00:53:52.963
NINE THE FIRST QUARTER ALMOST.

00:53:53.029 --> 00:53:55.031
ABOUT TWO AND A NINE MILLION

00:53:55.098 --> 00:53:56.933
DOLLARS OR HE PAID. TO RANT

00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:57.467
SOMEONE EXPECTED A BILLION

00:53:57.534 --> 00:53:58.835
DOLLARS.

00:53:58.902 --> 00:54:00.837
BY THE END OF THE YEAR.

00:54:00.904 --> 00:54:02.973
OUR 72% OF COMPANIES THAT WERE

00:54:03.039 --> 00:54:05.108
AFFECTED BY RANSOMWARE COULD NOT

00:54:05.175 --> 00:54:06.910
ACCESS THE DATA FOR A FEW DAYS

00:54:06.977 --> 00:54:07.544
AND ABOUT A THIRD COULDN'T EVEN

00:54:07.611 --> 00:54:10.847
GET IT FOR ABOUT A WEEK.

00:54:10.914 --> 00:54:13.016
A FEW MORE STAFF AS YOU CAN SEE

00:54:13.083 --> 00:54:13.617
THESE THINGS ARE NOT SLOWING

00:54:13.683 --> 00:54:15.285
DOWN THERE INCREASING -- THE

00:54:15.352 --> 00:54:17.053
NUMBER BUSINESSES TACKED.

00:54:17.120 --> 00:54:20.890
YOU KNOW IS IT IS GETTING MORE

00:54:20.957 --> 00:54:21.191
PREVALENT.

00:54:21.257 --> 00:54:22.892
THIS IS AN ISSUES THAT I THINK

00:54:22.959 --> 00:54:23.493
IT'S VERY CONSERVATIVE BUT ONE

00:54:23.560 --> 00:54:25.195
IN FIVE SMALL AND MEDIUM

00:54:25.261 --> 00:54:26.896
BUSINESSES WHO PAID A RANSOM.

00:54:26.963 --> 00:54:28.932
NEVER GOT THEIR DATA BACK I

LOGGERS YOU KNOW THESE ARE ALL

00:55:43.373 --> 00:55:45.275
STILL THREATS THAT WE ARE SEEN

00:55:45.341 --> 00:55:47.177
IN LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT WILL

00:55:47.243 --> 00:55:48.845
AFFECT NOT ONLY.

00:55:48.912 --> 00:55:49.512
THE COMMUNITY BUT BUSINESSES AS

00:55:49.579 --> 00:55:50.847
WELL.

00:55:50.914 --> 00:55:51.548
AGAIN I TALK ABOUT BUZZ WORDS TO

KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR WESTERN

00:55:53.216 --> 00:55:55.085
UNION MONEY GRAM BIT COIN GREEN

00:55:55.151 --> 00:55:56.986
DOT ITUNES.

00:55:57.053 --> 00:55:58.955
IF YOU SEE THESE WORDS POP UP NO

00:55:59.022 --> 00:56:01.091
LEGITIMATE COMPANY ONE ASKING

00:56:01.157 --> 00:56:01.725
AND ASKING FOR MONEY UP FRONT

00:56:01.791 --> 00:56:05.128
LET ALONE IN THESE TYPES OF

00:56:05.195 --> 00:56:05.361
FORMS.

00:56:05.428 --> 00:56:06.963
SO WHERE IS ALL THIS HEADING

00:56:07.030 --> 00:56:08.932
THIS IS A CURRENT STAT -- FROM

00:56:08.998 --> 00:56:11.401
THE IC THREE THE FBI STAT -- IN --

00:56:11.468 --> 00:56:13.103
COMPLAINT CENTER AS YOU CAN SEE

00:56:13.169 --> 00:56:15.238
BETWEEN 200-014-2000 EIGHT IN

00:56:15.305 --> 00:56:17.140
THE TOTAL LOSS AND FROM CYBER

00:56:17.207 --> 00:56:18.942
RELATED CRIMES WHAT FROM ABOUT

00:56:19.008 --> 00:56:19.576
EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION. TO TWO

00:56:19.642 --> 00:56:22.946
POINT SEVEN MILLION FOUR YEARS.

00:56:23.012 --> 00:56:23.580
OBVIOUSLY THE COMPLAINTS HAVE

00:56:23.646 --> 00:56:25.148
GONE UP NOT AT THE SAME PACE

00:56:25.215 --> 00:56:27.016
WHICH I THOUGHT WAS INTERESTING

00:56:27.083 --> 00:56:29.018
SO EITHER THAT MEANS THAT.

00:56:29.085 --> 00:56:31.054
EACH CRIME IS SEEN A BETTER

00:56:31.121 --> 00:56:32.989
REWARD FOR THESE CRIMINALS OR

00:56:33.056 --> 00:56:33.623
THE FACT THAT PEOPLE ARE JUST

00:56:33.690 --> 00:56:35.191
BASICALLY NOT REPORTING FOR THE

00:56:35.258 --> 00:56:36.993
FACTS WE TALKED ABOUT.

00:56:37.060 --> 00:56:39.028
IT'S P. BAD PR FOR THE BUSINESS

00:56:39.095 --> 00:56:39.662
IT'S EMBARRASSING ALL KINDS OF

00:56:39.729 --> 00:56:42.766
DIFFERENT WAYS -- SO THAT'S A

00:56:42.832 --> 00:56:43.366
LOT OF THROUGHOUT YOUR REALLY

00:56:43.433 --> 00:56:45.368
QUICK BUT FROM A LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:56:45.435 --> 00:56:45.702
PERSPECTIVE.

00:56:45.769 --> 00:56:47.070
THESE ARE VERY COMMON ONLY

00:56:47.137 --> 00:56:49.506
INCREASING -- AND IT'S PUTTING A

00:56:49.572 --> 00:56:51.241
GREAT WORKLOAD ON US.

00:56:51.307 --> 00:56:54.878
THANK YOU THANK YOU.

THE SUBJECT OF THIS DISCUSSION

00:57:03.319 --> 00:57:05.121
AND THE TALK IS GOING TO BE --

00:57:05.188 --> 00:57:06.923
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT FROM THE

00:57:06.990 --> 00:57:08.892
OTHER.

00:57:08.958 --> 00:57:10.860
THREE HACKER ONE IS FOCUSED ON

00:57:10.927 --> 00:57:13.029
DIGITAL VULNERABILITIES -- IT

00:57:13.096 --> 00:57:15.064
AND ITS MISSION IS TO PROTECT

00:57:15.131 --> 00:57:17.300
THE INTERNET I STILL LIKELY NOT

00:57:17.367 --> 00:57:19.235
THINGS THAT YOU WILL SEE AND

AFFECTS YOU.

00:57:24.908 --> 00:57:27.110
AT THE OTHER -- WAY THAT THIS

00:57:27.177 --> 00:57:27.777
GUY CONVERSATION IS GOING TO BE

00:57:27.844 --> 00:57:29.479
DIFFERENT IS THAT WHEN I SAY

00:57:29.546 --> 00:57:31.314
HACKERS I AM TALKING ABOUT THE

00:57:31.381 --> 00:57:33.216
GOOD ACTORS -- THE WHITE HAT

00:57:33.283 --> 00:57:36.920
HACKERS -- INDEPENDENT SECURITY

00:57:36.986 --> 00:57:38.922
RESEARCHERS ETHICAL SECURITY

00:57:38.988 --> 00:57:39.522

PARTY RESEARCHERS -- THOSE ARE

00:57:41.057 --> 00:57:42.992
ALL NAMES.

00:57:43.059 --> 00:57:44.994
THAT ARE USED TO DESCRIBE WHAT

00:57:45.061 --> 00:57:47.130
WE CALL AND HACKER WHEN HACKERS

00:57:47.197 --> 00:57:47.697
SO AND MAKE THAT IMPORTANT

00:57:47.764 --> 00:57:50.834
DIFFERENTIATION FROM -- HACKERS

00:57:50.900 --> 00:57:53.136
WHICH I WILL CALL BAD ACTORS IN

00:57:53.203 --> 00:57:56.940
THIS CASE [INAUDIBLE] ZERO

00:57:57.006 --> 00:57:59.275
HACKER ONE IS THE WORLD'S

00:57:59.342 --> 00:58:01.077
LEADING PROVIDER OF HACKER

00:58:01.144 --> 00:58:02.946
POWERED SECURITY.

00:58:03.012 --> 00:58:03.613
HACKER ONE OPERATES A BUG BOUNTY

00:58:03.680 --> 00:58:05.315
PROGRAMS THAT CONNECT COMPANIES

00:58:05.381 --> 00:58:07.183

BEFORE MALICIOUS ACTORS EXPLOIT

00:58:13.256 --> 00:58:14.791
THEM.

00:58:14.858 --> 00:58:17.227
AS OF MAY TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN

00:58:17.293 --> 00:58:18.995
WE HAVE OVER FOUR HUNDRED

BREACHES IN THE PROCESS.

00:58:45.021 --> 00:58:46.990
TODAY CYBERSECURITY PRACTICES

00:58:47.056 --> 00:58:47.557
ARE SEVERELY OUTDATED IN

00:58:47.624 --> 00:58:49.359
CONTRAST TO THE CYBER THREATS

00:58:49.425 --> 00:58:50.994
THAT SOCIETY FACES.

00:58:51.060 --> 00:58:53.096
WHEN EXPLOITED FOR CRIMINAL

AND RELATIVELY AND REMARKABLE

00:58:57.133 --> 00:58:59.002
SECURITY VULNERABILITY CAN

00:58:59.068 --> 00:59:01.004
CREATE HAVOC AS THE EQUIFAX DATA

PREACHERS HAVE MADE THE PRESS

00:59:08.912 --> 00:59:09.345
INCLUDING THE WANNA CRY

00:59:09.412 --> 00:59:12.916
RANSOMWARE ATTACK.

00:59:12.982 --> 00:59:15.051
I'M AND I THINK A PREVIOUS

00:59:15.118 --> 00:59:16.920
SPEAKER SAID THAT DID THESE

00:59:16.986 --> 00:59:17.186

00:59:17.253 --> 00:59:19.155
DETRIMENTALLY IMPACT SMALL

00:59:19.222 --> 00:59:21.124
MEDIUM BUSINESSES BECAUSE 60% OF

00:59:21.190 --> 00:59:23.393
THE SMALL MEDIUM BUSINESSES GO

00:59:23.459 --> 00:59:25.094
OUT OF BUSINESS SIX MONTHS.

00:59:25.161 --> 00:59:27.263
AFTER A DATA BREACH OR SPUR

00:59:27.330 --> 00:59:29.332
SECURITY INCIDENT SO WE'RE PROUD

00:59:29.399 --> 00:59:31.100

00:59:36.973 --> 00:59:37.473
SO NOW ONTO HACKER POWERED

00:59:37.540 --> 00:59:39.142
SECURITY AND WHAT EXACTLY IT IS

00:59:39.208 --> 00:59:41.044
IT IS WHAT WE THINK IS A

00:59:41.110 --> 00:59:43.279
SCALABLE MODEL THAT CAN BE USED

00:59:43.346 --> 00:59:45.114
TO PREVENT CYBER ATTACKS IN

ORGANIZATION IN QUESTION.

01:00:08.972 --> 01:00:09.472
IT IS A MODEL THAT INVITES

01:00:09.539 --> 01:00:10.773

TO DETECT AND FIX THEIR SECURITY

01:00:25.154 --> 01:00:27.357
THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL FUNCTION OF

01:02:52.902 --> 01:02:53.469
THE QUESTION I GET A LOT IS WHO

01:02:53.536 --> 01:02:54.937
ARE THESE HACKERS.

01:02:55.004 --> 01:02:57.073
SECURITY EXPERTS MAY BE

01:02:57.140 --> 01:02:59.275

WHITE HAD SECURITY RESEARCHER

01:03:03.079 --> 01:03:05.148
BOB HUNTER AND FINDER. ONE TITLE

IS CONSPICUOUSLY ABSENT CRIMINAL.

01:03:09.018 --> 01:03:10.920
HACKERS ARE NOT CRIMINALS

01:03:10.987 --> 01:03:12.889
SPECIFICALLY BY BODY PLATFORMS

01:03:12.955 --> 01:03:15.057
OFFER NO BENEFIT TO SOMEONE WITH

CRIMINAL INTENT.

01:03:17.026 --> 01:03:18.794
ON THE CONTRARY HACKER ONE WILL

01:03:18.861 --> 01:03:20.830
BE CAUGHT WE WILL RECORD DATA.

01:03:20.897 --> 01:03:22.865

THAT FOLLOW THE RULES. FOR THESE

01:03:27.637 --> 01:03:28.738
REASONS CRIMINALS GO ELSEWHERE.

01:03:28.804 --> 01:03:31.240
HACKERS ARE DRIVEN A VARIETY OF

01:03:31.307 --> 01:03:33.409
MOTIVATIONS MANY OF WHICH ARE

01:03:33.476 --> 01:03:34.911
ALTRUISTIC.

01:03:34.977 --> 01:03:37.046
THE SECURITY ADVOCATES ADVOCACY

01:03:37.113 --> 01:03:39.248
ORGANIZATION I AM THE CALVARY

01:03:39.315 --> 01:03:41.184
SUMMARIZES THESE MOTIVE IS THE

01:03:41.250 --> 01:03:42.985
MOTIVATIONS AS PROTECT.

01:03:43.052 --> 01:03:44.921
MAKE THE WORLD A SAFER PLACE

01:03:44.987 --> 01:03:47.123
PUZZLE TINKER OUT OF CURIOSITY

01:03:47.190 --> 01:03:49.192
PRESTIGE SEEK PRIDE AND

01:03:52.929 --> 01:03:55.031
AND AND PATRIOTISM IDEOLOGICAL

01:03:55.097 --> 01:03:56.899
AND PRINCIPLED.

01:03:56.966 --> 01:03:59.335
A TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN STUDY BY

01:03:59.402 --> 01:04:01.204
THE UNITED STATES NATIONAL

01:04:01.270 --> 01:04:02.972
TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND

01:04:03.039 --> 01:04:04.907

01:04:04.974 --> 01:04:05.441
WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:04:05.508 --> 01:04:05.708
COMMERCE.

01:04:05.775 --> 01:04:08.978
FOUND THAT ONLY 15% OF SECURITY

01:04:09.045 --> 01:04:10.913
RESEARCHERS EXPECT FINANCIAL

01:04:10.980 --> 01:04:12.949

AVAILABILITY DISCLOSURE.

01:04:14.951 --> 01:04:15.551
AND NOW I WANT TO THE TYPES OF

01:04:15.618 --> 01:04:18.754
BUGS THAT OUR GUYS FIND.

01:04:18.821 --> 01:04:20.890
SO THESE ARE THE TYPES OF

01:04:20.957 --> 01:04:22.825
VULNERABILITIES -- THAT OUR MOST

01:04:22.892 --> 01:04:25.061
POPULAR -- POPULARLY FOUND ON

01:04:25.127 --> 01:04:26.996
OUR A BUYER HACKERS.

01:04:27.063 --> 01:04:28.931
XSS WHICH IS CROSS SITE

01:04:28.998 --> 01:04:30.900
SCRIPTING THAT'S THE ABILITY TO

01:04:30.967 --> 01:04:32.935
RUN CHAVIS JAVA SCRIPT CODE IN A

01:04:33.002 --> 01:04:35.104
VICTIMS WEB BROWSER -- SO IF YOU

01:04:35.171 --> 01:04:38.941
HAVE AN EXERCISE BIKE AND G.

01:04:39.008 --> 01:04:39.342
EMAIL -- THE HAT.

01:04:39.408 --> 01:04:41.010
A BAD ACTOR OR CRIMINAL CAN DO

01:04:41.077 --> 01:04:42.878
WHAT YOU WOULD AT WHAT YOU

01:04:42.945 --> 01:04:43.479
ORDINARILY WOULD DO WHICH IS

01:04:43.546 --> 01:04:45.214
SENDING READ EMAILS.

01:04:45.281 --> 01:04:47.049
OF FROM YOUR ACCOUNT. 38% OF OUR

01:04:47.116 --> 01:04:49.252
HACKERS LIKE SEARCHING FOR THIS

01:04:49.318 --> 01:04:51.487
ONE SO THIS IS THE MOST COMMON

01:04:51.554 --> 01:04:53.389
BUT THAT WE FIND FOR CUSTOMERS.

01:04:53.456 --> 01:04:55.258
SIEGEL INJECTION THE ABILITY TO

01:04:55.324 --> 01:04:57.126
CONTROL DATABASE QUERIES

01:04:57.193 --> 01:04:59.161
PASSWORDS ENCRYPTED PASSWORDS

01:04:59.228 --> 01:05:01.030
AND FINANCIAL DATA.

01:05:01.097 --> 01:05:02.999
THIS IS SECOND PLACE THIRTEEN

01:05:03.065 --> 01:05:05.134
POINT 5% OF OUR HACKERS FIND

01:05:05.201 --> 01:05:05.768
THESE KINDS OF BUGS BEFORE THE

01:05:05.835 --> 01:05:08.871
BAD GUYS DO.

01:05:08.938 --> 01:05:10.806
ARE THE MOST COMMON TYPE IN ONE

01:05:10.873 --> 01:05:13.109
PARTICULAR SEGMENT WHICH IS A

01:05:13.175 --> 01:05:14.910
FINANCIAL SERVICES AND FAN TACK --

01:05:14.977 --> 01:05:16.879
WHICH MADE A COVER SOME OF THE

01:05:16.946 --> 01:05:19.115
REAL STATES AT BROKERAGE FORM AT

01:05:19.181 --> 01:05:19.348
FIRMS.

01:05:19.415 --> 01:05:22.818
IS THAT IS THAT IMPROPER

01:05:22.885 --> 01:05:25.087
AUTHENTICATION I'M SO AN EXAMPLE

01:05:25.154 --> 01:05:27.423
OF IMPROPER AUTHENTICATION ISN'T

01:05:27.490 --> 01:05:29.725
I DOOR ATTACK IT ALLOWS YOU TO

01:05:29.792 --> 01:05:31.160
SEE ANOTHER PERSON'S RECEIPT --

01:05:31.227 --> 01:05:33.696
AND SEE OTHER PEOPLE'S DATA --

01:05:33.763 --> 01:05:35.131
BY ACCIDENT BECAUSE THE CODE

01:05:35.197 --> 01:05:36.999
WASN'T DIDN'T ACCOMMODATE FOR

01:05:37.066 --> 01:05:41.504
THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION.

01:05:41.570 --> 01:05:43.039
ANOTHER COMMON BUG IS S. S. R.

01:05:43.105 --> 01:05:45.041
F. ACCESS TO INTERNAL NETWORK.

01:05:45.107 --> 01:05:47.276
IF SOMETHING IS HOSTED ON A

01:05:47.343 --> 01:05:49.312
CLOUD HACKERS COULDN'T ACT COULD

01:05:49.378 --> 01:05:49.812
GET AN ACCESS KEY TO

01:05:49.879 --> 01:05:51.047
AUTHENTICATION FOR THOSE

01:05:51.113 --> 01:05:52.882
INSTANCES.

01:05:52.948 --> 01:05:55.318
ACCESS INTERNAL TOOLS OF

01:05:55.384 --> 01:05:56.919
EMPLOYEES AND NOT INSIDERS

01:05:56.986 --> 01:05:58.988
ACCESS CLOUD INSTANCES AND

01:05:59.055 --> 01:06:01.123
BASICALLY STEAL DATA.

01:06:01.190 --> 01:06:02.958
WHY DO THESE BIKES HAPPEN?

01:06:03.025 --> 01:06:05.194
WE BELIEVE THAT BIKES HAPPEN

01:06:05.261 --> 01:06:06.962
BECAUSE ENGINEERS -- AREN'T

01:06:07.029 --> 01:06:08.998
REALLY THINKING OF USER INPUT --

01:06:09.065 --> 01:06:09.632
AT THE TIME THAT THEY'RE WRITING

01:06:09.699 --> 01:06:11.434
THE CODE -- THEIR STRESS FOR

01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:14.970
RELEASES AND PRESSURE FOR GROWTH

01:06:15.037 --> 01:06:17.206
SECURITY TENDS TO BE A DEFAULT --

01:06:17.273 --> 01:06:17.873
IF THERE'S NO Q. AND A TEAM OR

01:06:17.940 --> 01:06:21.277
SECURITY TEAM THE RELEASE APPS

01:06:21.344 --> 01:06:22.978
OR TOOLS BUGS WITH THEM.

01:06:23.045 --> 01:06:24.880
I AM HOWEVER YOU GUYS COMPANIES

01:06:24.947 --> 01:06:26.916
CAN LEVERAGE THE POWER OF THE

01:06:26.982 --> 01:06:27.516
ETHICAL HACKING COMMUNITY TO

01:06:27.583 --> 01:06:29.251
FIND THESE BIKES BEFORE BAD

01:06:29.318 --> 01:06:30.886
ACTORS DO.

01:06:30.953 --> 01:06:33.155
ARE HACKERS ALSO FIND ABOUT HALF

01:06:33.222 --> 01:06:35.157
OF THE BIKE THAT WE FIND OUR

01:06:35.224 --> 01:06:37.059
MEDIUM SEVERITY AND 15% ARE

01:06:37.126 --> 01:06:42.832
CONSIDERED CRITICAL -- SO AGAIN

01:06:42.898 --> 01:06:44.834
AS PART OF A SMALL MEDIUM

01:06:44.900 --> 01:06:46.836
BUSINESSES STRATEGY WHO CAN'T

01:06:46.902 --> 01:06:47.470
NECESSARILY AFFORD TO SECURITY

01:06:47.536 --> 01:06:49.372
ENGINEERS -- CONSULTANTS -- I'D

01:06:49.438 --> 01:06:51.207
SUGGEST TURNING TO AT THE

01:06:51.273 --> 01:06:53.175
HACKING COMMUNITY BY FIRST

01:06:53.242 --> 01:06:54.744
HAVING OF VULNERABILITY

01:06:54.810 --> 01:06:55.177
DISCLOSURE POLICY.

01:06:55.244 --> 01:06:57.446
JUST AT A MINIMUM MINIMUM

01:06:57.513 --> 01:07:01.150
SECURITY AT ADDRESS SO IF YOUR

01:07:01.217 --> 01:07:03.052
FELLOW NEIGHBOR FINDS A BUG OR

01:07:03.119 --> 01:07:03.686
YOUR CUSTOMER FINDS A BUG THEY

01:07:03.753 --> 01:07:05.287
HAVE A WAY TO TELL YOU BEFORE A

01:07:05.354 --> 01:07:07.022
BAD ACTOR EXPLOITS IT.

01:07:07.089 --> 01:07:09.125
AND THEN MOVE ON TO HAVING

01:07:09.191 --> 01:07:10.993
AVAILABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICY.

01:07:11.060 --> 01:07:12.928
WHICH HAS A COUPLE OF KEY

01:07:12.995 --> 01:07:14.964
COMPONENTS AND IT'S SPELLED OUT

01:07:15.030 --> 01:07:18.968
THE RULES OF WHAT IS ALLOWED AND

01:07:19.034 --> 01:07:19.402
WHAT ISN'T ALLOWED.

01:07:19.468 --> 01:07:21.070
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY A SAFE

01:07:21.137 --> 01:07:21.670
HARBOR FOR A COMMUNICATOR OF A

01:07:21.737 --> 01:07:22.872
BUG.

01:07:22.938 --> 01:07:25.207
THAT WAY YOU CAN LEVERAGE THE

01:07:25.274 --> 01:07:26.976
FREE HELP THAT THE SECURITY

01:07:27.042 --> 01:07:29.211
RESEARCHER COMMUNITY WILL GIVE

01:07:29.278 --> 01:07:30.880
YOU.

01:07:30.946 --> 01:07:33.015
I'M AND THEN MOST IMPORTANTLY BE

01:07:33.082 --> 01:07:33.649
SURE THAT YOU CAN IN TAKE THE

HER HUSBAND IS ALSO AN IT

01:14:03.138 --> 01:14:05.140

OF WERE ALL OVERWHELMED WITH.

01:32:22.837 --> 01:32:23.371

01:32:23.437 --> 01:32:25.039
SOCIAL MEDIA.

01:32:29.277 --> 01:32:31.379

NEW LABOR LAWS PENDING

01:32:45.026 --> 01:32:45.293
LEGISLATION.

01:32:45.359 --> 01:32:48.896
CHANGES TO REGULATIONS LOCALLY --

01:32:48.963 --> 01:32:50.998
HOWEVER WHEN IT COMES TO REALLY

01:32:51.065 --> 01:32:55.102
CRITICAL ISSUES -- I KINDA GO

01:32:55.169 --> 01:32:57.038
BACK IN TIME AND I PICK UP THE

01:32:57.104 --> 01:33:01.175

01:33:01.242 --> 01:33:02.910
CONSUMING THING TO DO.

01:33:02.977 --> 01:33:05.079

01:33:08.916 --> 01:33:10.885

THROUGH A VIA A PHONE CALL.

01:33:17.091 --> 01:33:18.893
AND OF COURSE THESE DAYS NOT

01:33:18.960 --> 01:33:19.460
MANY PEOPLE COMMUNICATE VIA

01:33:19.527 --> 01:33:21.228
PHONE SO THAT'S A LITTLE

01:33:21.295 --> 01:33:24.832
CHALLENGING AS WELL -- AS FAR AS

01:33:24.899 --> 01:33:26.968

TAKE IT A STEP FURTHER NOW.

01:34:16.951 --> 01:34:17.518

01:35:25.419 --> 01:35:27.354
WE'RE ALL YOU WANTED TO DO IS GO

01:35:27.421 --> 01:35:29.023
CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK

01:35:29.090 --> 01:35:29.657
CLICK CLICK AND GET TO THE VERY

01:35:29.723 --> 01:35:30.791
END AS FAST AS YOU COULD.

01:35:30.858 --> 01:35:33.027
RIGHT.

01:35:33.094 --> 01:35:33.694
AND AT THE END OF THE DAY THAT

01:35:33.761 --> 01:35:35.229
WAS A CHECK THE BOX EXERCISE FOR

01:35:35.296 --> 01:35:36.897
THEM.

01:35:36.964 --> 01:35:38.966
THAT REALLY DID NOTHING TO

01:35:39.033 --> 01:35:39.533
EDUCATE THEIR EMPLOYEES ON

01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:42.803
CYBERSECURITY -- BUT IT MEANT A

01:35:42.870 --> 01:35:44.939
COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS

01:35:45.005 --> 01:35:45.239
[INAUDIBLE]

01:35:45.306 --> 01:35:47.007
DOESN'T WORK.

01:35:47.074 --> 01:35:49.143
AND SO WE HAVE. THREE BIG

01:35:49.210 --> 01:35:50.911
PROBLEMS.

01:35:50.978 --> 01:35:53.047
THAT WE FACE IN THE

01:35:53.114 --> 01:35:56.784
CYBERSECURITY TRAINING WORLD --

01:35:56.851 --> 01:35:59.019
THAT NEED TO BE OVERCOME BY OUR

01:35:59.086 --> 01:36:01.355
SECURITY AWARENESS PROGRAM RIGHT.

01:36:01.422 --> 01:36:03.257
THE FIRST BIG PROBLEM IS THE

01:36:03.324 --> 01:36:05.059
HUMAN ATTENTION SPAN IS DOWN 33%

01:36:05.126 --> 01:36:07.361
FROM THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND TO

01:36:07.428 --> 01:36:08.896
THE YEAR.

01:36:08.963 --> 01:36:09.530
TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN THAT WAS A

01:36:09.597 --> 01:36:11.098
MICROSOFT ADVERTISING STUDY THAT

01:36:11.165 --> 01:36:12.967
THEY DID.

01:36:13.033 --> 01:36:13.601
IT WOULD FROM EIGHT SECONDS TO

01:36:13.667 --> 01:36:15.302
SIX SECONDS.

01:36:15.369 --> 01:36:17.071
THE HUMAN ATTENTION SPAN OF A

01:36:17.138 --> 01:36:18.806
CATERPILLARS EIGHT SECONDS.

01:36:18.873 --> 01:36:22.910
OURS IS SIX WHAT DOES THAT MEAN.

01:36:22.977 --> 01:36:24.912
IF WE ARE NOT ENGAGED.

01:36:24.979 --> 01:36:27.248
IN WHATEVER IT IS THAT WE'RE

01:36:27.314 --> 01:36:28.949
WATCHING THAT WE'RE LEARNING

01:36:29.016 --> 01:36:31.051
THERE WERE HEARING ABOUT IN THE

01:36:31.118 --> 01:36:32.920
FIRST SIX SECONDS.

01:36:32.987 --> 01:36:35.289
WE'RE GONNA REMIND TO OUR MINDS

01:36:35.356 --> 01:36:37.158
GO SOMEWHERE ELSE 90% OF THE

01:36:37.224 --> 01:36:39.226
TIME WHERE THEY GO WE PICK UP

01:36:39.293 --> 01:36:40.794
OUR FULL.

01:36:40.861 --> 01:36:43.197
AND SEE JUST HOW MANY LIKE THREE

01:36:43.264 --> 01:36:44.932
GOT IN OUR LAST INSTAGRAM POST.

01:36:44.999 --> 01:36:47.067
RIGHT SEC THAT'S A HUGE PROBLEM

01:36:47.134 --> 01:36:49.136
IS IT IS ATTENTION SPAN WHEN IT

01:36:49.203 --> 01:36:53.073
COMES TO EDUCATING [INAUDIBLE]

01:36:53.140 --> 01:36:53.440
OUR EMPLOYEES.

01:36:53.507 --> 01:36:55.376
ON CYBER AWARENESS AND SO HOW DO

01:36:55.442 --> 01:36:56.810
WE SOLVE FOR THAT.

01:36:56.877 --> 01:36:59.079
WHAT WE SAW FOR THAT BY MAKING

01:36:59.146 --> 01:37:01.048
THE TRAINING THAT WE DO FUN

01:37:01.115 --> 01:37:03.250
ENGAGING AND INTERESTING RIGHT

01:37:03.317 --> 01:37:05.419
AND SO WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT

01:37:05.486 --> 01:37:07.354
HERE IS SETTING UP? FOR FOR

01:37:07.421 --> 01:37:10.824
SMALL BUSINESS TO SET UP OR HAVE.

01:37:10.891 --> 01:37:13.027
EITHER ON YOUR OWN OR WITH THE

01:37:13.093 --> 01:37:14.795
HELP OF A COMPANY LIKE US TO SET

01:37:14.862 --> 01:37:16.964
UP A FULL FLEDGED SECURITY

01:37:17.031 --> 01:37:17.531
AWARENESS PROGRAM FOR YOUR

01:37:17.598 --> 01:37:18.933
EMPLOYEES.

01:37:18.999 --> 01:37:21.202
ARM THE SECOND BIG PROBLEM IS

01:37:21.268 --> 01:37:22.970
THAT HACKERS INNOVATE.

01:37:23.037 --> 01:37:24.972
THERE ARE A MILLION NEW PIECES

01:37:25.039 --> 01:37:28.943
OF MALWARE.

01:37:29.009 --> 01:37:29.376
THAT ARE DEVELOPED.

01:37:29.443 --> 01:37:32.980
NOT RELEASED OUT TO THE WORLD.

01:37:33.047 --> 01:37:34.915
A MILLION NEW PIECES OF OUR THAT

01:37:34.982 --> 01:37:36.884
ARE DEVELOPED EVERY DAY. TO

01:37:36.951 --> 01:37:38.819
CRAZY STATISTIC.

01:37:38.886 --> 01:37:43.057
AND THEN THE LAST -- ISSUE THAT

01:37:43.123 --> 01:37:44.992
WE HAVE IS THAT.

01:37:45.059 --> 01:37:47.361
WHEN WE DO CYBER AWARENESS

01:37:47.428 --> 01:37:48.963
TRAINING A LOT OF ORGANIZATIONS

01:37:49.029 --> 01:37:50.931
THEY DON'T HAVE FREQUENCY?

01:37:50.998 --> 01:37:54.835
THEY DON'T HAVE CONSISTENCY.

01:37:54.902 --> 01:37:55.069
RIGHT.

01:37:55.135 --> 01:37:56.937
AND I'M GONNA GIVE YOU KIND OF A

01:37:57.004 --> 01:37:57.538
CRUDE EXAMPLE OF WHAT I MEAN

01:37:57.605 --> 01:37:59.340

GONNA CURE CURIOSITY CURIOSITY.

01:38:02.910 --> 01:38:04.912
IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS

01:38:04.979 --> 01:38:06.814
WE HAVE AS HUMANS.

01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:07.448
AS WE GET THAT EMAIL THAT SAYS

01:38:07.514 --> 01:38:10.818

01:38:13.354 --> 01:38:14.955
IT IS.

01:38:15.022 --> 01:38:16.957
BUT IF YOU HOWEVER I HAVE I HAVE

01:38:17.024 --> 01:38:17.625

01:39:24.925 --> 01:39:26.827
I'M ABOUT TO REACH FOR IT

01:39:26.894 --> 01:39:27.127
[INAUDIBLE]

01:39:28.929 --> 01:39:31.098
BECAUSE OF THE STORY THAT I

HEARD FROM MY WIFE LAST NIGHT.

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.002
THE PROXIMITY OF THE EVENT.

01:39:35.069 --> 01:39:37.271
CHANGED MY HUMAN BEHAVIOR.

01:39:37.338 --> 01:39:41.208
OKAY. SIX MONTHS GO BY.

01:39:41.275 --> 01:39:43.110

BECAUSE NOW THAT EVENT IS IN THE

01:39:53.120 --> 01:39:55.089
BACK OF MY BRAIN.

01:39:55.155 --> 01:39:58.992
MY WHOLE POINT HERE IS THAT.

01:39:59.059 --> 01:40:00.861
EMPLOYERS SMALL BUSINESSES.

01:40:00.928 --> 01:40:04.932

THREE TIMES A MONTH.

01:40:10.904 --> 01:40:12.906
WITH SOMETHING.

01:40:12.973 --> 01:40:15.008

MITIGATE THESE THREATS.

01:50:48.942 --> 01:50:51.011
THE NATURE OF THE THREAT WE FACE

01:50:51.077 --> 01:50:51.578
TODAY CAN MOST EASILY BE

01:50:51.644 --> 01:50:54.881
DESCRIBED AS A MATH BATTLE.

01:50:54.948 --> 01:50:56.916
COST OF COMPUTE HAS RAPID IT HAS

01:50:56.983 --> 01:50:58.852

BUT DO NOT ENTER OPERATE AT THE

01:51:19.039 --> 01:51:19.539
LEVEL NEEDED TO COUNTER THE

01:51:19.606 --> 01:51:20.940
THREAT.

01:51:21.007 --> 01:51:21.474
THIS COMPLEXITY CREATES A

01:51:21.541 --> 01:51:23.243

GENERATED THE TAX.

01:51:30.984 --> 01:51:33.086
THE BOTTOM LINE IS THE GOOD GUYS

01:51:33.153 --> 01:51:33.720
ARE LOSING THEM OUT THAT'LL.

01:51:33.787 --> 01:51:35.321
LARGELY BECAUSE WE'RE BRINGING

01:51:48.968 --> 01:51:49.502
WITH THIS IN MIND -- LIKE TO

01:51:49.569 --> 01:51:50.970
DIVE A LITTLE DEEPER INTO HOW WE

01:51:51.037 --> 01:51:51.538
MAY IMPROVE EXISTING BEST

INFORMATION SHARING PROGRAMS.

01:52:09.022 --> 01:52:11.024
THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT ROBUST

01:52:11.091 --> 01:52:14.928
AUTOMATED SHARING PROGRAMS EXIST.

01:52:14.994 --> 01:52:15.595
YOUR NONPROFIT ENTITIES LIKE THE

01:52:15.662 --> 01:52:17.263
CYBER THREAT ALLIANCE WERE

01:52:17.330 --> 01:52:18.965
CYBERSECURITY VENDORS ARE

01:52:19.032 --> 01:52:20.934
COOPERATING TO WIDELY AND

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:21.568
AUTOMATICALLY DISTRIBUTE THREAT

01:52:21.634 --> 01:52:22.902
PROTECTIONS.

01:52:22.969 --> 01:52:24.804
DOWN TO SMALL BUSINESS LEVEL.

01:52:24.871 --> 01:52:27.273
WE'RE PROUD TO BE A FOUNDING

01:52:27.340 --> 01:52:28.908
MEMBER OF THE CYBER THREAT

01:52:28.975 --> 01:52:30.877
ALLIANCE AND AND NOW INCLUDES

01:52:33.379 --> 01:52:34.948
WORLD.

01:52:35.014 --> 01:52:36.983
THE UNDERLYING CHALLENGE WITH

01:52:37.050 --> 01:52:38.751
SHARING THREAT INTELLIGENCE

01:52:38.818 --> 01:52:39.385
UNIQUE TO THE SECURITY SECTOR.

01:52:39.452 --> 01:52:41.354
IS THAT MANY CYBERSECURITY

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

01:52:46.960 --> 01:52:47.460
SO INSTEAD OF SHARING THIS

01:52:47.527 --> 01:52:50.897
CRITICAL DATA FREELY AND OPENLY.

01:52:50.964 --> 01:52:51.531
MANY STILL MARKET THE STATE AS

01:52:51.598 --> 01:52:52.932
PART OF A SALES STRATEGY.

01:52:52.999 --> 01:52:55.268
OUR COMPANY STANCE IS QUITE

01:52:55.335 --> 01:52:56.803
SIMPLE.

01:52:56.870 --> 01:52:59.305
YOU SHOULD COMPETE ON WHAT YOUR

01:52:59.372 --> 01:53:00.907
TECHNOLOGY DOES WITH CYBER

01:53:00.974 --> 01:53:01.508
THREAT INFORMATION RATHER THAN

01:53:01.574 --> 01:53:04.777
THE INFORMATION ITSELF. ONE EASY

01:53:04.844 --> 01:53:05.311
METHOD FOR GOVERNMENTS TO

01:53:05.378 --> 01:53:06.913
INCENTIVIZE EFFECTIVE

01:53:06.980 --> 01:53:08.748
INFORMATION SHARING IS TO SIMPLY

01:53:08.815 --> 01:53:11.050
ASK BUSINESSES SEEKING CONTRACTS

01:53:11.117 --> 01:53:12.852
IF THEY ARE MEMBERS OF THE CTA

01:53:12.919 --> 01:53:15.021
OR ANY ORGANIZATION LIKE IT.

01:53:15.088 --> 01:53:16.923
AND IF NOT WHY NOT.

01:53:16.990 --> 01:53:19.058
AND FINALLY WE MUST ALSO KEEP

01:53:19.125 --> 01:53:19.559
PACE WITH THE SECURITY

01:53:19.626 --> 01:53:20.894

INCLUDE PHYSICAL RISKS AND

01:53:43.750 --> 01:53:44.984
CONSEQUENCES.

01:53:45.051 --> 01:53:46.953
ON A MUCH GREATER SKILL.

01:53:47.020 --> 01:53:48.955
WE CAN'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKES

01:53:49.022 --> 01:53:51.224
WE MADE IN THE PAST AND HOPE THE

01:53:51.291 --> 01:53:52.959
SLAPPING SECURITY ON AS AN

01:53:53.026 --> 01:53:54.794
AFTERTHOUGHT WILL SUFFICE.

01:53:54.861 --> 01:53:56.896
THIS IS POTENTIALLY AN AREA OF

01:53:56.963 --> 01:53:57.430
WHERE THE ASSEMBLY COULD

01:53:57.497 --> 01:53:59.199
CONSIDER ACTION -- OVERSIGHT TO

01:53:59.265 --> 01:54:00.900
ASSIST THE PROMISE OF FIVE G.

01:54:00.967 --> 01:54:03.102

MEDICAL DEVICES I TEAM MORE.

01:54:06.873 --> 01:54:08.975
LEGISLATORS SHOULD BE AWARE THAT

01:54:09.042 --> 01:54:09.609
WHAT FIVE G. OPENS THE DOOR TO

01:54:09.676 --> 01:54:10.944
EXCITING NEW BUSINESS

01:54:11.010 --> 01:54:12.946
OPPORTUNITIES IT ALSO INCREASES

01:54:13.012 --> 01:54:13.479
THE NUMBER OF POTENTIAL

01:54:13.546 --> 01:54:14.981
INTRUSION POINTS.

01:54:15.048 --> 01:54:16.816
AMPLIFYING THE SECURITY CONCERNS.

MEDIC TO MITIGATE THE INCREASED

01:54:19.285 --> 01:54:21.387
RISK ASSOCIATED WITH FIVE G. WE

01:54:21.454 --> 01:54:21.721
MUST ENCOURAGE

01:54:21.788 --> 01:54:23.122
TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS TO

OUR TOOLS TO COMMUNICATE TO

01:55:16.909 --> 01:55:18.811
REACH CUSTOMERS BUT INCREASINGLY.

01:55:18.878 --> 01:55:19.412
THEY DEPEND ON CLOUD SOFTWARE

01:55:19.479 --> 01:55:20.880
PROVIDERS LIKE GOOGLE AND OTHERS

01:55:20.947 --> 01:55:21.414

01:55:24.851 --> 01:55:26.919
OR BECOMING EXPERT THEMSELVES

01:55:26.986 --> 01:55:28.788
BOTH YOU VERY BIG CHALLENGES

01:55:28.855 --> 01:55:29.389
BECAUSE OF THE INDUSTRY WIDE

SHORTAGE OF CYBER SECURITY

01:55:29.989 --> 01:55:31.324
SKILLS AND WORKERS AND A WHAT

ARE HELPFUL.

01:57:10.923 --> 01:57:12.992
AS WE'VE HEARD BUSINESSES MUST

WE'VE HEARD ABOUT TODAY AND THE

01:57:41.020 --> 01:57:41.554
MOST EFFECTIVE PROTECTIONS CAN

01:57:41.621 --> 01:57:42.855
HAVE THE MOST IMPACT.

01:57:42.922 --> 01:57:45.124
WE BELIEVE THAT SMALL BUSINESSES

01:57:45.191 --> 01:57:47.126
SHOULD TRY TO FIRST PROTECT

01:57:47.193 --> 01:57:48.828
AGAINST EMAIL BORNE THREATS

01:57:48.895 --> 01:57:50.830
WE'VE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT THIS

01:57:50.897 --> 01:57:51.397
BEING THE MOST COMMON THREAT

01:57:51.464 --> 01:57:52.865
FACTOR.

01:57:52.932 --> 01:57:53.466
SECOND THE SHOULD STE REALLY

IN THE BUSINESS AND I'LL WELCOME

01:58:07.146 --> 01:58:09.081
A COMPROMISE WOULD BE VERY

01:58:09.148 --> 01:58:09.348
SERIOUS.

01:58:09.415 --> 01:58:13.352
THIRD THEY NEED TO FOCUS ON

WHERE THEY'RE SENSITIVE BUSINESS

01:58:14.086 --> 01:58:14.220

ON CUSTOMERS OR EMPLOYEES IT

01:58:17.056 --> 01:58:17.590
COULD BE PAYMENT DATE IT COULD

01:58:17.657 --> 01:58:19.225

THIS INFORMATION TO PROCESS SEES

01:58:27.200 --> 01:58:27.500
IN TECHNOLOGY.

01:58:27.567 --> 01:58:30.736

PRIORITY THEY NEED TO HELP THEIR

01:58:35.541 --> 01:58:37.109
EMPLOYEES UNDERSTAND THAT THEY

01:58:37.176 --> 01:58:39.312
ARE THE FRONTLINE OF DEFENSE --

01:58:39.378 --> 01:58:41.080
FOR THEIR BUSINESSES AND TAKE

01:58:41.147 --> 01:58:43.049
THIS SERIOUSLY SO I'D LIKE TO

01:58:43.115 --> 01:58:43.716
SPEND A LITTLE TIME ON EACH OF

01:58:43.783 --> 01:58:45.117
THESE AND DISCUSS HOW CLOUT

TECHNOLOGY FOR PROVIDERS LIKE

THREATS AS WE'VE HEARD FISHING

01:58:56.996 --> 01:58:57.430
ATTACKS OR EMAILS THAT

01:58:57.497 --> 01:58:58.064
IMPERSONATE A TRUSTED SOURCE TO

01:58:58.130 --> 01:58:59.065
TRICK USERS INTO SHARING

01:58:59.131 --> 01:58:59.632

01:58:59.699 --> 01:59:01.033
MALICIOUS SOFTWARE.

01:59:01.100 --> 01:59:03.002
IS A VERY PERVASIVE PROBLEM.

01:59:03.069 --> 01:59:04.871
AND LIKE MANY SECURITY

01:59:04.937 --> 01:59:06.906
CHALLENGES DEFENDING AGAINST

01:59:06.973 --> 01:59:07.440
PHISHING ATTACKS REQUIRES

01:59:07.507 --> 01:59:09.075
MULTIPLE LAYERS OF DEFENSE A

01:59:09.141 --> 01:59:10.910
CONCEPT OF WHAT WE CALL SECURITY

01:59:10.977 --> 01:59:12.778
DEFENSE IN DEPTH.

01:59:12.845 --> 01:59:13.312
NOW THE IDEAL DEFENSE IS

01:59:13.379 --> 01:59:15.114
STOPPING FISHING EMAILS FROM

01:59:15.181 --> 01:59:17.183
EVER REACHING A USER'S INBOX IF

01:59:17.250 --> 01:59:18.951
WE CAN DO THAT.

01:59:19.018 --> 01:59:19.452
IT'S A VERY VERY STRONG

01:59:19.519 --> 01:59:22.755
PROTECTION BUT THIS REQUIRES

01:59:22.822 --> 01:59:23.422
SMART SOFTWARE TO FILTER OUT THE

01:59:23.489 --> 01:59:25.224
DANGEROUS EMAILS BUT LET

THAT THE BUSINESS IS NOT

01:59:29.562 --> 01:59:30.897
AFFECTED.

01:59:30.963 --> 01:59:31.430
STRIKING THIS BALANCE IS

01:59:31.497 --> 01:59:33.165
DIFFICULT IN EVIL PROVIDERS LIKE

02:01:34.754 --> 02:01:35.254
AND WE EXPAND SOME OF THE

02:01:35.321 --> 02:01:39.025
SHORTENED EMAIL ADDRESSES ARE

02:01:39.091 --> 02:01:40.993
YOU ARE A ARE ELSE TO UNCOVER

02:01:41.060 --> 02:01:43.062
MALICIOUS LINKS.

02:01:43.129 --> 02:01:43.629
WITH THE PROTECTIONS THAT WE

02:01:43.696 --> 02:01:45.031
HAVE IN PLACE MORE THAN NINETY

02:01:45.097 --> 02:01:46.766
NINE POINT 9% OF BUSINESS EMAIL

02:01:46.832 --> 02:01:49.168
COMPROMISE SCENARIOS ARE EITHER

02:01:49.235 --> 02:01:49.835
AUTOMATICALLY MOVED TO THE SPAM

02:01:49.902 --> 02:01:53.005
FOLDER OR FLAG WITH WARNINGS TO

02:01:53.072 --> 02:01:53.606
USERS IN THIS CAN HAVE A VERY

02:01:53.673 --> 02:01:55.041
SIGNIFICANT EFFECT.

02:01:55.107 --> 02:01:55.608
IN MITIGATING THOSE TYPE OF

02:01:55.675 --> 02:01:56.942
ATTACKS.

02:01:57.009 --> 02:01:58.811
NEXT SLIDE PLEASE.

02:01:58.878 --> 02:02:01.047
THE LAST LINE OF DEFENSE AGAINST

02:02:01.113 --> 02:02:02.915
PHISHING ATTACKS IS STOPPING

02:02:02.982 --> 02:02:05.017
ATTACKERS IF AND WHEN THEY

02:02:05.084 --> 02:02:05.618
MANAGED TO STEAL A PASSWORD.

02:02:05.685 --> 02:02:07.420
NOW SOME OF THIS CAN BE DONE BY

02:02:07.486 --> 02:02:09.288
SERVICE PROVIDERS FOR EXAMPLE

02:02:09.355 --> 02:02:11.057
GOOGLE CHALLENGES MORE THAN ONE

02:02:11.123 --> 02:02:13.192
MILLION SIGN IN ATTEMPTS EVERY

02:02:13.259 --> 02:02:16.996
DAY WE'RE AN ATTACKER HAS THE

02:02:17.063 --> 02:02:17.396
USERS PASSWORD.

02:02:17.463 --> 02:02:18.931
BUT WERE OTHER FACTORS MAY BE

02:02:18.998 --> 02:02:21.133
SUSPICIOUS OR UNEXPECTED WE ASK

02:02:21.200 --> 02:02:22.702
THEM FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

02:02:22.768 --> 02:02:25.004
BEFORE THEY LOG IN SO THE MORE

02:02:25.071 --> 02:02:25.638
WE CAN DO THE LESS BUSINESSES

02:02:25.705 --> 02:02:27.106
NEED TO DO WE CONTINUE TO

02:02:27.173 --> 02:02:28.908
ADVANCE OUR CAPABILITIES IN THIS

02:02:28.974 --> 02:02:29.108
AREA.

02:02:29.175 --> 02:02:30.776
BUT AS WE'VE HEARD FROM OTHER

02:02:30.843 --> 02:02:32.945
PANELISTS TODAY THE OTHER

02:02:33.012 --> 02:02:34.947
DEFENSE AGAINST OWN PASSWORD IS

02:02:35.014 --> 02:02:35.614
ROUTE TO REQUIRE SOMETHING ELSE

02:02:35.681 --> 02:02:37.283
IN ADDITION TO THAT USER NAME

02:02:37.349 --> 02:02:39.151
AND PASSWORD TO LOG IN.

02:02:39.218 --> 02:02:41.087
THIS IS KNOWN AS WE HEARD AS TWO

02:02:41.153 --> 02:02:43.089
FACTOR AUTHENTICATION OR AS AT

02:02:43.155 --> 02:02:44.957
GOOGLE WE CALL IT TWO STEP

02:02:45.024 --> 02:02:46.959
VERIFICATION.

02:02:47.026 --> 02:02:48.861
THIS SECOND STEP CAN BE

02:02:48.928 --> 02:02:49.462
SOMETHING LIKE A CODE FROM AN

02:02:49.528 --> 02:02:51.130
APPLE ON THE PHONE OR AN APP ON

02:02:51.197 --> 02:02:52.932
A PC OR CAN BE A TEXT MESSAGE

02:02:52.998 --> 02:02:53.466
THAT IS SENT WHEN THE USER

02:02:53.532 --> 02:02:55.034
ATTEMPTS TO SIGN IN.

02:02:55.101 --> 02:02:57.069
NOW WHILE THIS IS STRONGER THAN

02:02:57.136 --> 02:02:58.804
THE USERNAME AND PASSWORD ALONE

02:02:58.871 --> 02:03:00.806
SOPHISTICATED ATTACKERS HAVE

02:03:00.873 --> 02:03:01.540
FOUND WAYS TO GET AROUND SOME OF

02:03:01.607 --> 02:03:03.175
THESE TWO STEP VERIFICATION

02:03:03.242 --> 02:03:04.877
METHODS.

02:03:04.944 --> 02:03:06.812
AND USERS ALSO DON'T LIKE THE

02:03:06.879 --> 02:03:07.413
ADDITIONAL FRICTION THIS THIS

02:03:07.480 --> 02:03:09.014
CREATES IN LOGGING IN SO THEY

02:03:09.081 --> 02:03:11.283
OFTEN LOOK TO TURN THIS OFFER

02:03:11.350 --> 02:03:11.650
CIRCUMVENT IT.

02:03:11.717 --> 02:03:13.285
AT GOOGLE WE PIONEERED THE USE

02:03:13.352 --> 02:03:15.187
OF A TWO STEP VERIFICATION

02:03:15.254 --> 02:03:17.123
METHOD CALLED SECURITY KEYS VERY

02:03:17.189 --> 02:03:19.058
SIMPLE -- THAT IS HIGHLY

02:03:19.125 --> 02:03:19.625
RESISTANT TO THESE TYPE OF

02:03:19.692 --> 02:03:21.193
ATTACKS ALL THE USER HAS TO DO

02:03:21.260 --> 02:03:24.897
IS INSERT -- A HEART A SMALL

02:03:24.964 --> 02:03:26.799
HARDWARE KEY AND TAP WHEN THEY

02:03:26.866 --> 02:03:28.934
ARE ASKED TO LOG IN SO.

02:03:29.001 --> 02:03:30.936
IN THIS WEEK WE INTRODUCED A

02:03:31.003 --> 02:03:31.537
VERSION OF THIS KEY THAT IS

02:03:31.604 --> 02:03:34.940
ACTUALLY BUILT INTO MOST MODERN

02:03:35.007 --> 02:03:35.608
ANDROID PHONES THAT MAKES THIS

02:03:35.674 --> 02:03:38.811
POWERFUL TECHNOLOGY TO PROTECT

02:03:38.878 --> 02:03:39.411
ACCOUNTS AVAILABLE TO ALMOST A

02:03:39.478 --> 02:03:40.946
BILLION USERS.

02:03:41.013 --> 02:03:43.282
THERE'S A RANGE OF OPTIONS THAT

02:03:43.349 --> 02:03:44.984
CAN FIT MOST ORGANIZATIONS WE

02:03:45.050 --> 02:03:47.052
SAY THAT SECURITY KEYS ARE EASY

02:03:47.119 --> 02:03:47.353
TO DEPLOY.

02:03:47.419 --> 02:03:50.890
EASY TO USE BUT VERY HARD ON

02:03:50.956 --> 02:03:51.157
FISHER'S.

02:03:51.223 --> 02:03:53.325
IN AGAIN TWO STEP VERIFICATION

02:03:53.392 --> 02:03:55.094
IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT TO PUT

02:03:55.161 --> 02:03:57.163
IN PLACE FOR WHAT WE CALL HIGH

02:03:57.229 --> 02:03:58.798
VALUES THIS WILL LIKELY BE THE

02:03:58.864 --> 02:03:59.031
TARGET.

02:03:59.098 --> 02:03:59.632
OF THE SCAMS THAT IN CRIMINAL

02:03:59.698 --> 02:04:01.167
ACTIVITY THAT WE HEARD ABOUT

02:04:01.233 --> 02:04:04.937
AGAIN EXECUTIVES EMPLOYEES IN

02:04:05.004 --> 02:04:08.908
FINANCE FUNCTIONS OR IT

02:04:08.974 --> 02:04:10.843
ADMINISTRATORS.

02:04:10.910 --> 02:04:11.277
NEXT SLIDE PLEASE.

02:04:11.343 --> 02:04:12.878
THE FINAL TECHNOLOGY

02:04:12.945 --> 02:04:13.479
RECOMMENDATION THAT I WANT TO

02:04:13.546 --> 02:04:14.914
SPEAK ABOUT INVOLVED SOLUTIONS

02:04:14.980 --> 02:04:15.514
THAT CAN STOP SENSITIVE DATA

02:04:15.581 --> 02:04:16.816
FROM LEAVING AN ORGANIZATION

02:04:16.882 --> 02:04:17.082
SYSTEMS.

02:04:17.149 --> 02:04:19.151
THIS TAPE THIS TECHNOLOGY IS

02:04:19.218 --> 02:04:21.053
CALLED DATA LOSS PREVENTION OR

02:04:21.120 --> 02:04:21.253
DLP.

02:04:21.320 --> 02:04:23.422
IT CAN DETECT SENSITIVE DATA

02:04:23.489 --> 02:04:25.024
SUCH AS SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS

02:04:25.090 --> 02:04:26.959
CREDIT CARD NUMBERS ACCOUNT

02:04:27.026 --> 02:04:28.928
DETAILS HEALTHCARE IDENTIFIERS

02:04:28.994 --> 02:04:31.130
IN OTHER PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE

02:04:31.197 --> 02:04:32.865
INFORMATION.

02:04:32.932 --> 02:04:34.900
GOOGLE'S OWN SOLUTION -- IF FOR

02:04:34.967 --> 02:04:35.501
THIS TECHNOLOGY DETECTS MORE

02:04:35.568 --> 02:04:37.269
THAN NINETY DIFFERENT SENSITIVE

02:04:37.336 --> 02:04:39.004
DATA TYPES AUTOMATICALLY AND CAN

02:04:39.071 --> 02:04:41.240
BLOCK OR WARN USERS AND YOU CAN

02:04:41.307 --> 02:04:41.707
SEE EXAMPLES OF THIS.

02:04:41.774 --> 02:04:43.275
WHEN THAT INFORMATION IS BEING

02:04:43.342 --> 02:04:45.211
SENT OVER EMAIL OR SHARED IN A

02:04:45.277 --> 02:04:46.946
DOCUMENT?

02:04:47.012 --> 02:04:47.613
THIS POWERFUL TECHNOLOGIES BUILT

02:04:47.680 --> 02:04:49.148
INTO GOOGLE'S EMAIL AND

02:04:49.215 --> 02:04:52.985
COLLABORATION PRODUCTS.

02:04:53.052 --> 02:04:53.586
DEAL P. CAN STOP INTENTIONALLY

02:04:53.652 --> 02:04:55.221
MALICIOUS ACTIVITY SUCH AS THAT

02:04:55.287 --> 02:04:57.056
IS BEING DRIVEN BY BAD ACTORS

02:04:57.122 --> 02:04:58.891
BUT WE'RE WE SEE THE MOST VALUE --

02:04:58.958 --> 02:05:00.726
ESPECIALLY FOR SMALL BUSINESSES

02:05:00.793 --> 02:05:03.028
ISN'T HELPING STOP INADVERTENT

02:05:03.095 --> 02:05:04.797
DISCLOSURES OF DATA MISTAKES ARE

02:05:04.864 --> 02:05:05.431
SITUATIONS WHERE USER MIGHT NOT

02:05:05.497 --> 02:05:07.132
EVEN BE AWARE THAT THEY'RE

02:05:07.199 --> 02:05:09.235
HANDLING THIS TYPE OF DATA OR

02:05:09.301 --> 02:05:11.003
SHARING IT OUT.

02:05:11.070 --> 02:05:12.938
MANY DATA BREACHES THAT WE SEE

02:05:13.005 --> 02:05:14.740
ARE THE RESULT OF UNINTENDED --

02:05:14.807 --> 02:05:16.909
ON INTO UNINTENTIONAL DISCLOSURE

02:05:16.976 --> 02:05:17.376
IN THIS TECHNOLOGIES

02:05:17.443 --> 02:05:20.779
PARTICULARLY USEFUL IN

02:05:20.846 --> 02:05:21.380
ADDRESSING THE SITUATIONS --

02:05:21.447 --> 02:05:23.048
NEXT SLIDE PLEASE.

02:05:23.115 --> 02:05:24.884
SO THE LAST POINT I WANT TO MAKE

02:05:24.950 --> 02:05:26.819
IS THAT THE SOLUTIONS I SPOKE

02:05:26.886 --> 02:05:27.353
ABOUT AND PRIORITIZED ARE

02:05:27.419 --> 02:05:29.221
FOCUSED ON STOPPING THREATS THAT

02:05:29.288 --> 02:05:32.958
PRIMARILY TARGET PEOPLE AND WE

02:05:33.025 --> 02:05:33.392
HEARD THIS POINT.

02:05:33.459 --> 02:05:35.094
ME VERY STRONGLY IN OUR LAST

02:05:35.160 --> 02:05:37.062
PANEL CYBER CRIMINALS KNOWS THE

02:05:37.129 --> 02:05:38.998
USERS NOT THE TECHNOLOGY

02:05:39.064 --> 02:05:41.000
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT THEY'RE THAT

02:05:41.066 --> 02:05:41.634
THEY'RE USING A TAKE ADVANTAGE

02:05:41.700 --> 02:05:43.402
OF OUR OFTEN THE EASIEST TARGETS.

02:05:43.469 --> 02:05:46.872
SO BUSINESSES LARGE AND SMALL

02:05:46.939 --> 02:05:47.506
NEED TO EDUCATE THEIR EMPLOYEES

02:05:47.573 --> 02:05:49.341
AND MAKE SECURITY A BUSINESS

02:05:49.408 --> 02:05:51.243
PRIORITY THEY MUST HELP UNDER

02:05:51.310 --> 02:05:52.978
USERS UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE

02:05:53.045 --> 02:05:54.947
THE FRONTLINE OF DEFENSE. FOR

02:05:55.014 --> 02:05:56.982
THEIR BUSINESS AND THEIR ACTIONS

02:05:57.049 --> 02:05:57.549
MAKE A DIFFERENCE WE CAN'T

02:05:57.616 --> 02:05:59.285
STIGMATIZE THEM AS VICTIMS WHEN

02:05:59.351 --> 02:06:03.022
BAD THINGS HAPPEN THAT'S VERY

02:06:03.088 --> 02:06:04.857
YOU KNOW A BAD PRACTICE.

02:06:04.924 --> 02:06:05.224
SO TO CONCLUDE.

02:06:05.291 --> 02:06:07.192
SMALL BUSINESS YOU SHOULD FOCUS

02:06:07.259 --> 02:06:07.726
ON ADDRESSING EMAIL BORNE

02:06:07.793 --> 02:06:08.928
THREATS.

02:06:08.994 --> 02:06:10.729
PROVIDING ADDITIONAL PROTECTION

02:06:10.796 --> 02:06:11.363
FOR THE HIGH VALUE USERS THREE

02:06:11.430 --> 02:06:12.965
TWO STEP VERIFICATION AND

02:06:13.032 --> 02:06:15.100
MINIMIZING UNINTENDED DISCLOSURE

02:06:15.167 --> 02:06:16.902
OF SENSITIVE DATA.

02:06:16.969 --> 02:06:18.904
WITH THE HELP OF AFFECTED AND

02:06:18.971 --> 02:06:21.006
POWERFUL CLOUD BASED TOOLS THAT

02:06:21.073 --> 02:06:21.440
ARE COST EFFECTIVE.

02:06:21.507 --> 02:06:23.008
EASY TO IMPLEMENTING USE SMALL

02:06:23.075 --> 02:06:25.210
BUSINESSES CAN BECOME MORE

02:06:25.277 --> 02:06:26.912
RESILIENT TO CYBER THREATS.

02:06:26.979 --> 02:06:27.546
FOCUS ON THEIR CORE BUSINESS

02:06:27.613 --> 02:06:30.849
RATHER BECOMING SECURITY EXPERTS

02:06:30.916 --> 02:06:32.918
AND PROSPER AND GROW.

02:06:32.985 --> 02:06:33.485
WE WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE

02:06:33.552 --> 02:06:35.054
OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK AND SHARE

02:06:35.120 --> 02:06:36.855
OUR POINT OF VIEW ARE IMPORTANT

02:06:36.922 --> 02:06:38.891
TOPIC AND WE'LL HANDLE QUESTIONS

02:06:38.958 --> 02:06:39.224
AS WE DECIDE.

02:06:39.291 --> 02:06:41.126
ALL RIGHT THANK YOU AND AND

02:06:41.193 --> 02:06:43.228
AGAIN A A GREAT PANEL AND I

02:06:43.295 --> 02:06:46.732
APPRECIATE YOU TALKING FAST

02:06:46.799 --> 02:06:47.266
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE WERE.

02:06:47.333 --> 02:06:47.633
A LITTLE BIT.

02:06:47.700 --> 02:06:48.867
SHORT ON TIME BUT SINCE WE HAVE

02:06:48.934 --> 02:06:50.970
THE LUXURY OF A COUPLE OF

02:06:51.036 --> 02:06:53.072
QUESTIONS I DO HAVE -- FOR BOTH

02:06:53.138 --> 02:06:55.174
OF YOU JUST SOME QUICK QUESTIONS

02:06:55.240 --> 02:06:56.909
A THE WHAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING SO

02:06:56.976 --> 02:06:58.911
MUCH ABOUT TO STEP OF

02:06:58.978 --> 02:07:01.013
AUTHORIZATION ON G. MAIL OR

02:07:01.080 --> 02:07:02.881
VERIFICATION AND VIA TEXT

02:07:02.948 --> 02:07:03.515
MESSAGE NOW YOU MENTIONED THAT

02:07:03.582 --> 02:07:04.783
THAT'S NOT A 100%.

02:07:04.850 --> 02:07:07.186
SECURITY MORE OF HOW IS IT THAT

02:07:07.252 --> 02:07:08.921
THE HACKERS ARE GETTING AROUND

02:07:08.988 --> 02:07:09.121
THAT.

02:07:09.188 --> 02:07:11.323
YEAH SO -- IN THE CASE THAT THEY

02:07:11.390 --> 02:07:13.092
ARE ABLE TO GET AROUND SOME OF

02:07:13.158 --> 02:07:14.860
THE FORMS OF TWO STEP

02:07:14.927 --> 02:07:15.194
VERIFICATION.

02:07:15.260 --> 02:07:17.363
COMMONLY WHAT WILL HAPPEN IS

02:07:17.429 --> 02:07:19.365
THAT IT REVIEW RELYING ON AN APP

02:07:19.431 --> 02:07:21.200
THAT IS PRESENT ON A PHONE OR

02:07:21.266 --> 02:07:22.901
SOMETHING IS SENT VIA TEXT

02:07:22.968 --> 02:07:23.469
MESSAGE AND SO IF THERE IS

02:07:23.535 --> 02:07:25.170
MALWARE ALREADY ON THE PHONE IT

02:07:25.237 --> 02:07:26.972
CAN INTERCEPT THAT CODE.

02:07:27.039 --> 02:07:28.974
AND SEND IN THAT CODE AHEAD VERY

02:07:29.041 --> 02:07:29.608
SIMILAR TO WHAT WE HEARD ABOUT

02:07:29.675 --> 02:07:31.377
SOME OF THE THE ESCROW SKIM SO

02:07:31.443 --> 02:07:33.212
THEY CAN THEY CAN DO THAT AND

02:07:33.278 --> 02:07:33.579
CAPTURE THAT.

02:07:33.645 --> 02:07:35.180
WE'VE ALSO SEEN IN VERY HIGH

02:07:35.247 --> 02:07:37.116
VALUE CASES IN AGAIN WITH

02:07:37.182 --> 02:07:39.251
SOMETHING HIGH DOLLAR VALUE

02:07:39.318 --> 02:07:41.120
THINGS WITH CRYPTO CURRENCY OR

02:07:41.186 --> 02:07:43.022
THINGS AROUND ESCROW THEY WILL

02:07:43.088 --> 02:07:45.290
ACTUALLY GO TO THE PHONE COMPANY.

02:07:45.357 --> 02:07:48.861
AND ASKED TO SWAP YOUR PROBE --

02:07:48.927 --> 02:07:51.096
IMPERSONATE A CUSTOMER AND SAY I

02:07:51.163 --> 02:07:53.265
NEED TO CHANGE OUT MY SIM CARD

02:07:53.332 --> 02:07:55.234
AND SO BY GETTING THAT SIM CARD

02:07:55.300 --> 02:07:55.868
THEY CAN ACTUALLY PUT THAT IN A

02:07:55.934 --> 02:07:57.202
NEW PHONE AND GET THOSE TEXT

02:07:57.269 --> 02:07:59.304
MESSAGES WAS RECENTLY A CASE I

02:07:59.371 --> 02:08:01.173
THINK TODAY -- THAT THE FBI

02:08:01.240 --> 02:08:02.908
BROUGHT WHERE THEY INDICTED ON

02:08:02.975 --> 02:08:04.810
NINE INDIVIDUALS AS A RESULT OF

02:08:04.877 --> 02:08:05.377
PERPETRATING SOME OF THE SIM

02:08:05.444 --> 02:08:08.914
SWAPPING SCHEMES SO -- AGAIN THE

02:08:08.981 --> 02:08:10.916
TECHNOLOGY THAT WE OFFER IN

02:08:10.983 --> 02:08:11.550
TERMS OF SECURITY KEYS BECAUSE

02:08:11.617 --> 02:08:14.753
IT IS A PHYSICAL HARDWARE DEVICE

02:08:14.820 --> 02:08:21.193
AND DOES SOME -- TECHNOLOGY THAT

02:08:21.260 --> 02:08:23.195
THAT OUGHT INDICATES BOTH THE

02:08:23.262 --> 02:08:25.164
USER AGAIN THE SITE IT'S IMMUNE

02:08:25.230 --> 02:08:25.731
TO THOSE DIFFERENT TYPES OF

02:08:25.798 --> 02:08:27.199
TECHNOLOGIES BUT AGAIN ANY FORM

02:08:27.266 --> 02:08:29.068
OF TWO STEP VERIFICATION IS MUCH

02:08:29.134 --> 02:08:29.701
STRONGER THAN A USER NAME AND

02:08:29.768 --> 02:08:31.303
PASSWORD ALONE AND WE SHOULDN'T

02:08:31.370 --> 02:08:31.603
DISCOURAGE.

02:08:31.670 --> 02:08:34.973
THE USE OF ANY OF THOSE FORMS.

02:08:35.040 --> 02:08:35.641
AND THE MELHAM THAT WE'RE ON THE

02:08:35.707 --> 02:08:36.275
PHONE THAT MIGHT INTERCEPT THE

02:08:36.341 --> 02:08:37.443
TEXT MESSAGE WOULD BE THAT YOU

02:08:37.509 --> 02:08:39.044
CLICK TO LINK IS SATURATED I

02:08:39.111 --> 02:08:41.280
WOULD BE -- IT COULD BE A LINK

02:08:41.346 --> 02:08:43.048
THAT WAS CLICKED FOR A USER

02:08:43.115 --> 02:08:44.883
DOWNLOADED AN APP -- FROM -- YOU

02:08:44.950 --> 02:08:46.952
KNOW A SOURCE THAT IS NOT FOR

02:08:47.019 --> 02:08:49.121
EXAMPLE -- THE YOU KNOW THE

02:08:49.188 --> 02:08:51.190
PHONE MANUFACTURERS APPS STORE

02:08:51.256 --> 02:08:53.092
WERE MOST OF THE APPS THERE ARE

02:08:53.158 --> 02:08:55.027
VETTED AND LOOKED OUT FOR

02:08:55.094 --> 02:08:57.396
SECURITY PURPOSES WE SEE THIS --

02:08:57.463 --> 02:09:00.966
THIS PURPOSE OF AS PRACTICE OF

02:09:01.033 --> 02:09:01.633
SIDE LOADING OR BRINGING IN APPS

02:09:01.700 --> 02:09:03.102
FROM UNTRUSTED -- UNTRUSTED

02:09:03.168 --> 02:09:04.937
SOURCES AND THAT'S A THAT'S A

02:09:05.003 --> 02:09:07.039
REALLY COMMON WAY FOR MALWARE TO

02:09:07.106 --> 02:09:09.308
GET ON ADVICE OR GET ON THE

02:09:09.374 --> 02:09:10.776
PHONE OKAY WE ALWAYS ENCOURAGE

02:09:10.843 --> 02:09:12.811
USERS TO DOWNLOAD APPS ONLY FROM.

02:09:12.878 --> 02:09:15.180
THE OFFICIAL APP STORES OF THEIR

02:09:15.247 --> 02:09:17.216
PHONE MANUFACTURER -- OKAY AND

02:09:17.282 --> 02:09:17.716
THEN THE LAST THING YOU

02:09:17.783 --> 02:09:20.886
MENTIONED SECURITY PHONE I MEAN

02:09:20.953 --> 02:09:22.988
THE SECURITY KIDS FOR ANDROID

02:09:23.055 --> 02:09:23.222
PHONES.

02:09:23.288 --> 02:09:27.025
NOW FROM G. MAIL YOU DON'T HAVE

02:09:27.092 --> 02:09:29.027
ANYTHING FOR IPHONE -- SECURITY

02:09:29.094 --> 02:09:30.896
SO NOT NOT AT THIS POINT IN TIME

02:09:30.963 --> 02:09:31.497
BUT WE'RE ACTIVELY LOOKING AT

02:09:31.563 --> 02:09:33.232
HOW WE CAN EXTEND THIS

02:09:33.298 --> 02:09:35.167
TECHNOLOGY CONTENT THAT'S THAT'S

02:09:35.234 --> 02:09:36.902
GREAT INFORMATION BECAUSE THAT'S

02:09:36.969 --> 02:09:37.503
ONE OF THE WHEN WE DO ALL OUR

02:09:37.569 --> 02:09:39.071
CYBER TALKS ONE OF THE FIRST

02:09:39.138 --> 02:09:39.605
THINGS WE TALK ABOUT IS.

02:09:39.671 --> 02:09:41.206
MAKING SURE THAT THERE'S TWO

02:09:41.273 --> 02:09:41.840
SEVEN AUTHENTICATION BUT WE ALSO

02:09:41.907 --> 02:09:43.275
WANT TO TRY TO KEEP AHEAD OF OF

02:09:43.342 --> 02:09:49.214
SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT ARE

02:09:49.281 --> 02:09:50.816
COMING UP.

02:09:50.883 --> 02:09:51.483
SO THANK YOU FOR THAT AND THEN I

02:09:51.550 --> 02:09:53.352
JUST WANTED TO ASK -- DAVID YOU

02:09:53.418 --> 02:09:56.989
HAD MENTIONED ABOUT THE THE AYE

02:09:57.055 --> 02:09:57.189
AYE.

02:09:57.256 --> 02:10:00.792
WE WERE HEARING A LOT ABOUT THE

02:10:00.859 --> 02:10:02.928
THE THE INCREDIBLE POTENTIAL OF

02:10:02.995 --> 02:10:03.562
FIVE G. BUT ALSO THE RISKS AND I

02:10:03.629 --> 02:10:04.229
I THINK THE RISKS IN THE UNITED

02:10:04.296 --> 02:10:06.965
STATES ARE SOMEWHAT LESS THAN

02:10:07.032 --> 02:10:07.466
THOSE HAVE WHO HAVE.

02:10:07.533 --> 02:10:09.134
CHOSEN TO GO WITH THE CHINESE

02:10:09.201 --> 02:10:10.802
TECHNOLOGY.

02:10:10.869 --> 02:10:12.871
BUT WHAT WHAT YOU MENTIONED THAT

02:10:12.938 --> 02:10:15.174
LEGISLATORS COULD LOOK AT A

02:10:15.240 --> 02:10:15.741
LEGISLATION ARE YOU TALKING

02:10:15.807 --> 02:10:16.975
ABOUT SPECIFICALLY IN CALIFORNIA

02:10:17.042 --> 02:10:17.609
WOULD THAT HAVE TO BE SOMETHING

02:10:17.676 --> 02:10:19.178
DONE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL.

02:10:19.244 --> 02:10:19.778
I THINK IT APPLIES ACROSS THE

02:10:19.845 --> 02:10:22.848
BOARD MA'AM I THINK -- AS WE

02:10:22.915 --> 02:10:24.917
BEGIN TO ADOPT FIVE G..

02:10:24.983 --> 02:10:25.484
I THINK TELECOMMUNICATIONS

02:10:25.551 --> 02:10:28.787
PROVIDERS NEED TO BE ENCOURAGED

02:10:28.854 --> 02:10:30.789
TO FIGURE OUT HOW. TO DESIGN

02:10:30.856 --> 02:10:32.791
SECURITY ON THE FRONT END OF

02:10:32.858 --> 02:10:34.826
THAT PROCESS AS OPPOSED.

02:10:34.893 --> 02:10:36.862
TO KIND OF HOW WE'VE DONE IT FOR

02:10:36.929 --> 02:10:37.329
THREE G. AND FOUR G..

02:10:37.396 --> 02:10:38.997
YOU KNOW FIGURING OUT HOW WE

02:10:39.064 --> 02:10:40.799
TACK ON SECURITY AFTER THE FACT

02:10:40.866 --> 02:10:43.168
RIGHT THERE I THINK THIRD I

02:10:43.235 --> 02:10:45.237
THINK WHAT POLICY MAKERS CAN

02:10:45.304 --> 02:10:46.905
HELP DO.

02:10:46.972 --> 02:10:48.974
IS DRIVE YOU KNOW A DEEPER

02:10:49.041 --> 02:10:50.842
DISCUSSION INTO HOW SECURITY IS

02:10:50.909 --> 02:10:52.945
GOING TO BE IMPACTED BY FIVE G..

02:10:53.011 --> 02:10:54.780
NOT NECESSARILY A A SPECIFIC

02:10:54.846 --> 02:10:56.982
LEGISLATIVE FIX OR ACTION.

02:10:57.049 --> 02:10:59.151
BUT JUST PROMOTING KIND OF THE

02:10:59.218 --> 02:11:04.823

02:11:11.630 --> 02:11:13.131
TALKED ABOUT IS THAT ALL THESE
