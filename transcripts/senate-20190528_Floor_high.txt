WE'RE STARTING WITH FILE ITEM FOURTEEN SENATOR ALLEN. NOT AT HIS DESK. FILE ITEM TWENTY ONE SENATOR JACKSON ARE YOU PREPARED TO TAKE UP. VERY GOOD MISTER SECRETARY PLEASE READ. SENATE BILL FOR SIXTY A SENATOR JACKSON AN ACT RELATING TO TAXATION. SENATOR JACKSON'S GOOD -- GOOD. AFTERNOON MADAM PRESIDENT AND COLLEAGUES. THIS MEASURE SB FOUR SIXTY EIGHT IS A GOOD GOVERNMENT MEASURE. THAT WILL HELP US IMPROVE OUR SYSTEM OF TAX EXPENDITURES. TO ENSURE WE MAKE THE BEST USE OF OUR LIMITED PUBLIC DOLLARS. CALIFORNIA HAS CREATED. AND PASSED NEARLY [inaudible] EIGHTY TAX EXPENDITURES. THESE ARE PROVISIONS IN THE TAX CODE THEY INCLUDE TAX CREDITS TAX DEDUCTIONS SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS AND INCOME EXCLUSIONS THAT REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF TAX COLLECTED. FROM A PARTICULAR INDUSTRY OR SECTOR IN EXCHANGE FOR AN INTENDED PUBLIC POLICY OBJECTIVES. HOW MANY TAX EXPENDITURES WERE CREATED DECADES AGO? AS FAR BACK AS THE NINETEEN FORTIES. THEY WERE DESIGNED TO ACHIEVE CERTAIN GOALS SUCH AS IMPROVING INDUSTRY COMPETITIVENESS INFLUENCING TAXPAYER BEHAVIOR. OR SPURRING ECONOMIC GROWTH ALL OF WHICH ARE VERY SHOWN THE INAPPROPRIATE IN WORTHY GOALS. BUT THEY HAVE SAT ON THE BOOKS FOR DECADES WITHOUT ANY SCRUTINY WITHOUT ANY OVERSIGHT AND WITHOUT EVEN ANY DATA TO DEMONSTRATE THE RESULTS THAT THEIR CONTINUED EFFECTIVENESS OR RELEVANCE. EXISTS TODAY. THESE TAX EXPENDITURES KERRY SIGNIFICANT COSTS TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN THE SAME MANNER AS OUR SPENDING PROGRAMS. THIS YEAR TAX EXPENDITURES WILL REDUCE REVENUES IN THIS TO US STATE IN OUR GENERAL FUND BY SOME SIXTY SIX BILLION DOLLARS. EVERY DOLLAR OFA TAX EXPENDITURE THAT DOES NOT GENERATE ITS COST IN NEW REVENUE TAKES APPROXIMATELY FORTY CENTS OUT OF CALIFORNIA'S CLASSROOMS VIA PROP. NINETY EIGHT AND REDUCES THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING AVAILABLE FOR CRITICAL PUBLIC SERVICES HEALTH CARE. INFRASTRUCTURE HIGHER EDUCATION HOUSING MENTAL HEALTH THE COURTS THAT SAID. FOR SO THE QUESTION IS ARE THESE TAX EXPENDITURES WORTH THEIR COST. IF I IF YOU PROMISE ME THAT IF I GIVE YOU A DOLLAR IF YOU'LL GIVE ME BACK. TEN WELL OF COURSE I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU THAT DOLLAR. BUT IF YOU PROMISE ME THAT YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE ME BACK TEN AND YOU GIVE ME BACK TWENTY FIVE CENTS. MAYBE I NEED TO RE EVALUATE THAT. DEAL. BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY IT'S NOT CONTINUING ITS BENEFIT. AND A TWENTY FIFTEEN AUDIT BY THE STATE AUDITOR IN CALIFORNIA CONCLUDED THAT QUOTE ADOPTING OVERSIGHT METHODS. WOULD IMPROVE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE STATE'S CURRENT AND FUTURE TAX EXPENDITURES PROVIDING THE LEGISLATURE WITH MORE INFORMATION AND A BETTER ACCOUNTING OF THEIR EFFECTIVENESS. AND IMPACT. EIGHT TWENTY SEVENTEEN REPORT BY THE PEW CHARITABLE TRUSTS SCORED CALIFORNIA IS TRAILING. WITH TWENTY EIGHT STATES AHEAD OF US IN EVALUATING THEIR TAX INCENTIVE PROGRAMS IN INFORMING THEIR LEGISLATURE'S AS TO THE VALUE OF THESE PROGRAMS. SO SB FOUR SIXTY EIGHT BEGINS AN OVERSIGHT PROCESS REGARDING TAX EXPENDITURES THAT WE'VE ACTUALLY BELIEVE IT OR NOT NEVER HAD BEFORE IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY. AND I HOPE THAT IT'S ONE THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN BUILD UPON. IT CREATES A BOARD CONSISTING OF THE STATE COMPTROLLER. THE LEAD CHANNEL LIST THE STATE AUDITOR AND DESIGNATE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND A DESIGNATED THE US SECRETARY. OF GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS AGENCY. THIS BOARD WILL PRIORITIZE THE EXAMINATION OF THESE TAX EXPENDITURES. AND WHICH OF THESE TAX BREAKS WE SHOULD EVALUATE FIRST. AND THEN IT DIRECTS THE LA -- TO CARRY OUT THE RESEARCH NOW I'M MINDFUL THAT IF THE LA -- DOESN'T HAVE THE BAND WITH TO DO THIS THAT ANOTHER ENTITY MAY IN FACT BE MORE APPROPRIATE BUT THIS IS THE BASIC FRAMEWORK THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT AFTER THE LA -- OR WHOMEVER WE CHOOSE HAS PERFORMED A THOROUGH EXAMINATION OF THE VALUE TO THE STATE OF A TAX EXPENDITURE. THE BOARD WILL HOLD PUBLIC HEARINGS INTENDED TO RECEIVE INPUT FROM INTERESTED STAKEHOLDERS OF ALL KINDS. REGARDING THAT STUDY AND THE BENEFITS OF THE TAX EXPENDITURE. FOLLOWING THAT THE BOARD WILL MAKE A RECOMMENDATION TO THE LEGISLATURE. AS TO THE MAINTENANCE DELETION AUGMENTATION OR REDUCTION IN THE TAX EXPENDITURE IF WE AS A LEGISLATURE DEEM IT APPROPRIATE. THIS BILL BRINGS TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY TO OUR TAX INCENTIVE PROCESS BY CREATING A MECHANISM AND A PUBLIC PROCESS FOR REVIEW. WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE. THANK YOU CENTER JACKSON MEMBERS IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE FURTHERMORE LOCK. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT SITE DONE OPENS BUYERS REMORSE SIR. A WHITE -- BUT DIE I'M I IT'S JUST MAYBE THE FRUSTRATION THAT MAYBE THIS BILL SHOULD ST AERO. THAT WILL NOT COME CLOSE TO HITTING THE TARGET I WAS HOPING THAT IT MIGHT -- I LIKE THE INTENT OF SENATE BILL. FOUR SIXTY EIGHT AS A FORMER TAX PREPARER I WOULD RATHER SEE INDIVIDUAL AND CORPORATE TAX CREDITS. EVALUATED WHICH ARE THE TRUE TAX EXPENDITURES. I BELIEVE LOOKING AT TEN THIRTY ONE EXCHANGES ARE HE STOPS OR S. CORPSE. THAT THAT IS JUST -- GOING TO BE DRIVING US INTO A CALL THE SACK -- IT'S A DEAD END DRIVE NOT CONFORMING WITH FEDERAL TAX LAW ON ME STRATEGIES AS TIME AND ENERGY MISSPENT I BELIEVE. THE CONSEQUENTLY I'M IN A LAYOFF OF SB. SIX FOUR SIX EIGHT WITH THE HOPES THAT A MORE APPROPRIATELY FOCUSED EFFORT COMES BACK TO US FOR CONCERN CONCURRENCE THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT THANK YOU CENTER MORE LIKE MEMBERS FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. SEEING AND HEARING NONE CENTER JACKSON WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE IT'S THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT WE IS A STATE CREATE TAX INCENTIVES FOR VARIOUS SECTORS. FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE ONE NOW FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY BECAUSE THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY PROMISED US THAT IF WE GAVE THEM CERTAIN TAX CREDITS AND INCENTIVES. THAT WULD CREATE MORE BUSINESS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. BECAUSE THAT BILL WAS PASSED AFTER TWENTY FOURTEEN AND WE WOULD PUT TO CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS AND METRICS ON THEM THEY ACTUALLY CAME BACK AND DEMONSTRATED THAT THAT TAX CREDIT WAS WORKING SO WELL. THAT WE AUGMENTED IT. BUT WE DO REQUIRE THEM TO COME FORWARD AND TO EXPLAIN TO US WHY THIS IS SERVING THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. WHAT THIS MEASURE DOES IS IT STARTS US MOVING FROM TWENTY FOURTEEN BACK? TO WHERE WE HAVE. TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF TAX CREDITS FOR WHICH WE'VE NEVER EVEN ASKED THAT QUESTION. AND SO IT WAS IT IS BECAUSE OF THAT THAT WE NEED TO GIVE TRANSPARENCY AND OVERSIGHT TO THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE ON HOW WE'RE SPENDING THEIR MONEY. AND IF WE ARE DOING IT IN THE BEST MANNER POSSIBLE AND WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU CENTER JACKSON MISTER SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL ALLEN [inaudible] BY ARCHULETA [inaudible] I ATKINS [inaudible] BATES [inaudible] NOBEL.

SENATOR RUBIO. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS. TODAY I'M PRESENTING SB TWO SEVENTY THREE ALSO KNOWN AS THE PHOENIX ACT. SB TWO SEVENTY THREE WOULD EXTEND THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS FOR FELONY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. OFFENSES FROM THREE YEARS TO TEN YEARS FOR SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. TO REPORT THEIR ABUSE THE BILL ALSO PROVIDES CRITICAL TRAINING FOR PEACE OFFICERS TO BE ABLE TO HELP SURVIVORS. ASK THE RIGHT QUESTIONS AT AND AND HELP THEM COME FORWARD. MEMBERS IT IS TIME TO EMPOWER VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE DATA SHOWS MULTIPLE REASONS WHY SURVIVORS MAY NOT COME FORWARD WITHIN THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS INCLUDING H.. THE TIME OF THE ABUSE ONGOING TRAUMA THREATS BY THEIR PERPETRATORS OR LACK OF EVIDENCE IN AMERICA AN AVERAGE OF FIFTY WOMEN ARE SHOT TO DEATH BY THEIR INTIMATE PARTNERS EVERY MONTH. AND MANY MORE ARE INJURED. WHEN MY STORY WAS PUBLICIZED AS I TOO AM A VICTIM OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HUNDREDS THE WOMEN CAME FORWARD TO TELL THEIR STORIES? ONE WOMAN IN PARTICULAR STANDS OUT TO ME. SHE SPENT EIGHTEEN YEARS IN AN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP. EVEN AFTER IT ENDED SHE WASN'T ABLE TO COME FORWARD. IT WAS TOO EMBARRASSING TO TRAUMATIZING [inaudible] ONE OTHER WOMAN STATED. THAT SHE GOT AWAY FROM HER ABUSER. AND HE WAS STALKING HER. SO MUCH SO THAT HE FOUND HER. SHOT INTO HER HOME AND SHOT HER FATHER. LET'S NOT MAKE THE STATUTE OF LIMITATION. ONE MORE HURDLE. THEN AN ALREADY BROKEN TRAUMATIZED VICTIM HOUSE TO JUMP. I URGE YOU TO JOIN ME. AND PROTECTIONS FOR WOMEN SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. IT'S NOT ONLY WOMEN IT'S ALSO MEN AND THE NUMBERS ARE GROWING WITH THAT I ASKED FOR A RIVAL THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER RUBIO DEBATER DISCUSSION DEBATE OR DISCUSSION SENATOR NIELSEN FOLLOWED BY CENTER BORCHERS. BETTER PRESIDENT LAYS DOWN THE SENATE I DO INDEED URGE AN AYE VOTE. AND THIS IS ANOTHER STEP IN A LONG CONTINUUM OF ELEVATING. THE KNOWLEDGE OF AND THE CONSEQUENCES OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE INCIDENTS. I THANK THE AUTHOR FOR MENTIONING THAT SOMETIMES. MAYBE RARELY BUT THAT DOES HAPPEN TO ME IN. TWO WAY BACK IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES. AT THE PLEASURE WORKING WITH THEN MEMBERS JACKIE SPEAR AT AND SHE LOOKED COOL. WHO WERE PIONEERS IN THIS AREA OF LAW? I WAS NOT HERE BUT I WAS TERM THE BOARD PRISON TERMS. AND ADMINISTRATIVELY WE WERE ABLE TO DO SOME THINGS THAT ALSO ELEVATED THE CONSEQUENCES FOR PERPETRATORS WHO HAD SUCH INSTANCES IN THEIR HISTORY. EDIT ELP PAINT A PICTURE OF THEIR FUTURE DANGEROUS THIS. THIS IS ALL. TOO COMMON. IN SOCIETY THEN THE AUTHOR MAKES A GOOD POINT. THE INTIMIDATION. AND THE FEAR. THE INDIVIDUAL WHO HAS BEEN SO -- PRESTON [inaudible] AND HEART. THEN IT'S PHYSICAL. BUT IT'S ALSO PSYCHOLOGICAL. I DON'T HAVE [inaudible] GOVERNOR FUTURE. AND FUTURE RELATIONSHIPS. CAN I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DEAL WITH MANY OF THESE INSTANCES AND STUDY THEM AND THAT. THE PRECURSOR EVENTS THAT LED UP. THE CRITICAL MOMENT OF THAT ACTUAL. WOMAN FINALLY COMING FORWARD. FOR THE INFORMATION GETTING OUT IN SOME MANNER. SO THAT THE PERPETRATOR. ADD TO PAY SOME PRICE. THIS IS ANOTHER AGAIN STEP. IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. TOWARDS MINIMISING SUCH INCIDENCES. BUT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE DOMESTIC ABUSE. AND IN SOME CASES I WOULD EVEN ARGUE TORTURE [inaudible] I VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR NIELSEN. OF THIS LOOK LIKE CENTER BOARD JUST WANTS TO SPEAK AT THIS POINT SO WILL CALL ON SENATOR SKINNER. THANK YOU ARE. MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS I STAND IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL AND I KNOW THAT SOME PEOPLE MIGHT BE CONCERNED THAT STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS THERE THERE'S A REASON WE HAVE THAT ON CRIMES. AND CERTAINLY IN THE ISSUE OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IT IS MOST COMMON THAT NOT MOST COMMON WOULD BE OBVIOUS THAT YOU YOU THE VICTIM WOULD KNOW YOUR PERPETRATOR. AND SO THERE'S SOME ARGUMENT THAT. IF YOU KNOW THE PERPETRATOR WHY WOULD YOU NEED A LONGER STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS. BUT I THINK WHAT WE KNOW. IS THAT VERY OFTEN. THE PERSON WHO IS THE VICTIM OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE [inaudible] THEY ARE. SUSCEPTIBLE TO IT BECAUSE THEY ARE DEPENDENT. ON THE PERSON. AND WHEN YOU ARE DEPENDENT ON THE PERSON IT IS MUCH HARDER. FOR YOU TO BE ABLE TO SEE. THAT YOUR AN INNOCENT VICTIM IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE. THERE'S ALSO A GREAT DEAL OF SHAME. SO IT IS MUCH HARDER THAN TO REPORT. ADDITIONALLY. MANY PEOPLE ARE DEPENDENT ON THE PERSON FINANCIALLY. AND SO THEY COULD JEOPARDIZE THEY OR THEIR CHILDREN'S LIVELIHOOD. WITH REPORTING. SO THEY MAY BE ABLE TO EXTRACT THEMSELVES FROM THE DOMESTIC ABUSE BUT STILL NOT BE WILLING FOR ANY NUMBER OF REASONS TO REPORT. AND WHEN THEY FINALLY GET TO THE POINT IN THEIR LIVES WHETHER IT'S THROUGH. COUNSELING OR WHETHER THROUGH NOT BEING FINANCIALLY OR OTHERWISE DEPEND ON THE PERSON ANY LONGER. THEY SHOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO REPORT AND IF THEY HAVE THE EVIDENCE THEN THE PERSON WHO WAS THE PERPETRATOR OF THAT TO MYSTIC VIOLENCE SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. AND SO WITH THAT I ASKED ZERO VOTE. THANK YOU SKINNER CENTERS SKINNER ANY FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION. SEEING AND HEARING NONE SENATOR RUBIO YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU AND I DO WANT TO THANK BOTH OF MY COLLEAGUES THAT. THE JUST SHARED SUPPORT FOR THE FOR FOR THIS BILL IT IS A REALLY CRITICAL PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT WOULD HELP. EMPOWER WOMEN TO COME FORWARD I AM INCLINED TO SHARE ONE OF THE WITNESSES THAT TESTIFIED IN MY AND MY A HEARING. THIS VICTIM. WAS TIED UP [inaudible] TORTURED STARVED SHE WAS SLEEP DEPRIVED. SHE HAD TO GO TO COUNTY FOR SO MANY YEARS. THEN SHE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS. BY THE TIME SHE DECIDED TO COME FORWARD SHE HAD AUDIO. VIDEO. THREATENING LETTERS. AND SHE WAS TOLD HER TIME WAS UP. SHE COULDN'T BRING HER PERPETRATOR TO JUSTICE BECAUSE IT WAS TOO LATE. EVEN WITH THE EVIDENCE SHE HAD. AND SO THIS IS SO IMPORTANT IT IS PERSONAL AS YOU ALL KNOW. AND I REALLY APPRECIATE AND I VOTE THANK YOU. ALL DEBATE HAVING SEIZED MISTER SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL ALLEN. HI ARCHULETA. I ATKINS [inaudible] BATES. HI BILL.

MISTER SECRETARY PLEASE THREE FOUR SENATE BILL THREE TEN BY SENATOR SKINNER AND ACT RELATED TO JURIES. SENATOR SKINNER. THANK YOU AYE MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS [inaudible] I'M COLLEAGUES. I ASK YOU WHAT TO MARTHA STEWART. LARRY KING AND TIM ALLEN. ALL HAVE IN COMMON. IF THEY LIVED IN CALIFORNIA. AND THEY REGISTERED TO VOTE THEY WOULD BE LEGALLY ABLE TO REGISTER VOTE AND LEGALLY ABLE TO VOTE. BUT WHAT THEY COULD NEVER DO IN CALIFORNIA IS SERVE ON A JURY WHY? BECAUSE ALL OF THEM. WERE PASSED. CONVICTED OF A FELONY. NOW ALL OF THEM AS WE KNOW SERVE THEIR TIME. HAVE. BEEN LAW ABIDING AND GOODS CONTRIBUTORS TO OUR SOCIETY. AND YET IN CALIFORNIA THEY WOULD BE FOR EVER BEYOND FROM SERVING ON A JURY. THE BASIC FUNDAMENTAL. NOTION OF JURIES IN OF OUR CONSTITUTION IS THAT. WE WOULD BE [inaudible] WE WOULD. THE ABILITY TO GO BEFORE OUR PEERS. THAT IS A JURY OF OUR PEERS THAT WOULD DETERMINE. AFTER THE EVIDENCE WHETHER WE WERE. GUILTY OR NOT. BUT NOW DUE TO THAT FACT. IN CALIFORNIA IT IS HARD FOR MANY PEOPLE TO HAVE A JURY OF THEIR PEERS AND IN FACT. RIGHT TODAY IN CALIFORNIA 30% OF OUR AFRICAN AMERICAN MEN THAT LIVE IN CALIFORNIA WOULD BE FOREVER BARRED FROM SERVING ON A JURY WHEREAS HOWEVER. THEY HAVE THEIR VOTING RIGHTS RESTORED AND MANY MANY OTHER RIGHTS RESTORED INCLUDING THEIR ABILITY TO GET PROFESSIONAL LICENSES. AND MANY OTHER THINGS. SO WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DO. IS. PROVIDE. LIFT THAT BAN THAT WE NOW HAVE IN STATUTE -- THERE WAS LATE OPPOSITION FROM THE DA'S THEY DID NOT EXPRESS THEIR OPPOSITION WHEN IT WAS BEFORE COMMITTEE IN PUBLIC SAFETY. SUBSEQUENT TO THAT I'VE SAT DOWN WITH THE DA ASSOCIATION AND WE'VE TALKED ABOUT WHAT THEIR CONCERN IS IN THE EVER CONCERNED THAT EVEN IF YOU ARE UNDER -- PAROLE THAT YOU WOULD UNDER THIS BILL BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT RIGHT TO VOTE SO I WILL WE HAVE DISCUSSED AMENDMENTS. AND I WILL BE TAKING AN AMENDMENT IN THE ASSEMBLY. SO THAT HOPEFULLY THE DA'S WE'LL GET TO NEUTRAL THEY HAVE DISTRIBUTED A LETTER CONFIRMING THAT WE'VE HAD THIS CONVERSATION -- AND THE BILL ALSO STILL RETAINS THE ABILITY FOR THE PROSECUTOR OR THE PUBLIC DEFENDER. TO BASICALLY STRIKE A JUROR SO TO NOT CONSIDER THEM. AND IT STILL RETAINS THE QUESTIONNAIRE PROCESS WHICH CAN ASK PEOPLE EVERYTHING. THINGS LIKE HAVE THEY EVER BEEN CONVICTED OF A CRIME SO IF THE PROSECUTOR DOES NOT WANT TO HAVE. PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN PASSED CONVICTED OF A CRIME THEY CAN USE THEIR ABILITY TO STRIKE A JUROR [inaudible] SO ESSENTIALLY WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS JUST RESTORE THE RIGHTS IN THE SAME WAY THAT WE RESTORE PEOPLE'S VOTING RIGHTS AND WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. DEBATE OR DISCUSSION ON THIS ITEM SENATOR HERTZBERG. OUR SYSTEM OF LAWS. IN THIS COUNTRY AND IN THIS STATE. ARE BASED UPON. DEEP. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS. AND THOSE ARE THAT WHEN YOU HAVE A DATE YOU PAY IT. WHEN YOU HAVE A DEBT TO SOCIETY YOU PAY IT? SERVING PRISON TARMA JAIL TIME IF YOU'RE A IN JAIL BECAUSE OF A FELONY WE NOW HAVE CHALLENGES FOLKS WHO ARE FELONS WHO IN JAIL. YOU PAID YOUR DEBT. DOES THAT MEAN THAT YOU SHOULD NOT ALSO HAVE THE PRIVILEGE THERE'S THOSE WHO DON'T LIKE TO SERVE ON JURIES ARE THOSE THAT THINK IT'S A PROBLEM. BUT THERE'S A DIGNITY IN PARTICIPATING IN SOCIETY THERE'S A DIGNITY WHEN YOU HAVE PAID YOUR DEBT TO SOCIETY THIS BILL RESTORES THAT. NOT ONLY DOES IT HAVE IS THE AUTHOR SUGGESTED THE IDEA THAT YOU GET SUBJECT TO A JURY OF YOUR PEERS UP THE IT CAME OUT OF THE ORIGINAL JURY SYSTEM FROM OVER A HUNDRED YEARS AGO. BUT IT'S A MUCH DEEPER DYNAMIC IN MY JUDGMENT. THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE WHO HAVE COMMITTED A WRONG PAY THEIR DEBT. BUT THAT THEY ALSO BE COMMON EVERY POSSIBLE REASONABLE WAY FULL MEMBERS OF A PARTICIPATING SOCIETY AND THAT INCLUDES PARTICIPATING IN JURY SERVICE I ASK YOUR AYE BOAT. FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION SEEING AND HEARING ON SENATOR SKINNER YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU I THINK WE ARE PRESENTED THE BILL WELL AND I HOPE THAT -- PEOPLE AGREE THAT THIS IS A LEGITIMATE RIGHT TO BE RESTORED AND I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE.

CURRENTLY TWO SEPARATE UNALIGNED SYSTEMS FOR REIMBURSING CHILD CARE PROVIDERS LIMIT ACCESS FAILED TO MAXIMIZE PROGRAM QUALITY AND FORCE MANY CHILD CARE PROVIDERS OUT OF BUSINESS. WELL SOME PROVIDERS RECEIVE A RATE BASED ON FACTORS SUCH AS GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION AND REGIONAL CHILD COST OF CHILDCARE. OTHERS PROVIDE PROVIDERS THAT MEET HIGHER STANDARDS RECEIVE A FLAT RATE REGARDLESS OF LOCATION AND THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS. TO DESK DRESS THE PROBLEMS CREATED BY THE CURRENT RATE SYSTEM RESOURCES MANAGER SHOULD BE STREAMLINED AND SPENT IN A WAY THAT. CAN YOU GUYS GO OVER THERE. SORRY IT'S JUST DISTRACTING THANK YOU. COMPENSATES TEACHERS AND PROGRAMS FOR THE COST OF PROVIDING CARE ARE RESPONSIVE TO THE ECONOMIC DIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA RECOGNIZE THE COSTS OF MEETING VARYING QUALITY STANDARDS.

PIECES OF LEGISLATION TO ENSURE EQUAL OPPORTUNITY FOR GIRLS AND WOMEN IN THIS NATION. SO THIS IS THOUGH A MEASURE THAT ALSO EXTENDS TO SEX EQUITY IN ALL EDUCATION LAW ALONG WITH CORRESPONDING STATE LAW. IT'S BEEN VITAL TO ENSURE THAT ALL STUDENTS WOMEN AND MEN. AS WELL AS GIRLS AND BOYS AT EVERY GRADE LEVEL. IT ENSURES THAT THEY HAVE EQUAL OPPORTUNITY FOR SUCCESS IN ACADEMICS AS WELL AS ATHLETICS AND CAN SPURS SEWER IN EDUCATION IN AN ENVIRONMENT SAFE FROM SEXUAL HARASSMENT. AND VIOLENCE. THIS IS AN ITEM TITLE NINE IS THERE TO PROTECT IN THE AREA OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND SEXUAL ASSAULT BUT SADLY AND SOMEWHAT SHOCKINGLY. SEXUAL ASSAULT AND VIOLENCE IN IN HIGHER EDUCATION IS PERVASIVE. ACCORDING TO THE TWENTY SIXTEEN CAMPUS CLIMATE SURVEY VALIDATION STUDY OF TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITY STUDENTS. AN ESTIMATED 62% OF WOMEN. AND 61% OF MEN EXPERIENCE SEXUAL HARASSMENT ONE IN FIVE WOMEN. AND ONE IN FOURTEEN MEN EXPERIENCE SEXUAL ASSAULT. IN COLLEGE HOWEVER DUE TO THE UNDER REPORTING THAT WE KNOW EXISTS AND WAS DISCUSSED PREVIOUSLY ON THE ISSUE OF DOMESTIC ABUSE AND CRIMES RELATING TO GENDER DISPARITIES AT CENTRAL. THESE ARE YOU KNOW FORMALLY UNDER REPORTED SO THE NUMBERS ARE MOST LIKELY EVEN HIGHER BUT YET ONE IN FIVE AND ONE IN FOURTEEN IS TOO MANY. THE EFFECTS OF THIS ARE OFTEN DIRE. STUDENTS TO EXPERIENCE SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND ASSAULT NOT ONLY SUFFER PHYSICALLY AND EMOTIONALLY BUT ARE ALSO DENIED AN EQUITABLE ACCESS TO EDUCATION WHEN SCHOOLS DO NOT APPROPRIATELY RESPOND. TO AND OR INVESTIGATE THESE INCIDENTS ONE OF THE MANY HARMFUL RESULTS OF CAMPUS SURROUNDS MEANT AND THE SALT IS THE PUSH OUT. THAT OFTEN OCCURS WHEN SCHOOLS DO NOT TAKE APPROPRIATE STEPS TO RESPOND TO THESE INCIDENTS. AND AN ESTIMATED 34%. THAT'S WHY ONE IN THREE OF STUDENT SURVIVORS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT ON CAMPUS WILL DROP OUT OF SCHOOL. ONE IN. THREE CALIFORNIA HAS LOOKED TO AND RELIED UPON TITLE NINE FOR DECADES ALONG WITH THE REQUIREMENTS I STATE LAW BUT WE ARE INCREASINGLY CONCERNED. AND BY THE STATEMENTS THAT ARE BEING MADE ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL BY THE FEDERAL DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND MISS BETSY DEVICE TO CHEERS. THE CONCERN THAT THERE IS DISMANTLING OF TITLE NINE PROTECTIONS BY THIS ADMINISTRATION. THAT HAS EXPRESSED OPEN HOSTILITY BOTH OF THE SAFEGUARDS THE TITLE NINE PRESENTS AND TO ADDRESSING GENDER BASED VIOLENCE IN GENERAL. IT HAS IN FACT ALREADY PROPOSED FEDERAL REGULATIONS THAT GOT TITLE NINE'S CRITICAL PROTECTIONS SO WHAT DO WE DO WHEN THAT HAPPENS HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE MOVED. TO CODIFY THOSE IMPORTANT PROCEDURES TO MAKE SURE WE CAN PROTECT AGAINST THAT KIND OF DE CONSTRUCTION GOING ON THAT WE NEED TO DO MORE TO PROTECT THE STUDENTS BOTH MALES AND FEMALES. IN THE COLLEGE SETTING SO THIS MEASURE DOES THE FOLLOWING IT ADDS SEXUAL VIOLENCE TO THE DEFINITION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN THE EDUCATION CODE. IT DIRECTS ALL POST SECONDARY EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS. IMPLEMENT FUNDAMENTAL PROCESSES AND REQUIREMENTS REGARDING SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND SEXUAL VIOLENCE PREVENTION BECAUSE WE KNOW PREVENTION IS ALWAYS THE BEST WAY TO DEAL WITH THESE PROBLEMS IF AT ALL POSSIBLE. IT ALSO INCLUDES ADOPTING AND PUBLISHING GRIEVANCE PROCEDURES AND PROVIDING FOR PROMPT AND EQUITABLE RESOLUTION OF COMPLAINTS. IT ALSO REQUIRES AN EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION TO TAKE IMMEDIATE ACTION WHEN IT FINDS AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT HAS CREATED A HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT. TO ELIMINATE THAT HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT PREVENT ITS REOCCURRENCE AND ADDRESS IT'S AFFECTS. COLLEAGUES WE HAVE HAD ON THE FLOOR WOMEN JIM THIS. THE NATIONAL CHAMPIONS OLYMPIC GOLD MEDALISTS WHO TALK ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCES IN THE COLLEGE SETTING. BEING VICTIMS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT AND HARASSMENT WE NEED TO DO BETTER AND THIS IS A MEASURE THAT WILL. DO THE BEST THAT IS POSSIBLE BOTH TO PREVENT AND THEN WHEN IT OCCURS TO PROVIDE A SYSTEM OF DUE PROCESS FOR ALL PARTIES CONCERNED. TO TRY TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM AND TO MAKE SURE THAT WE REDUCE AND HOPEFULLY AT SOME POINT EXTINGUISH THIS EPIDEMIC THAT IS GOING ON AMONG OUR STATE AND OUR NATION'S COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITY WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR RIFLE. THANK YOU CENTER JACKSON MEMBERS DISCUSSION AND DEBATE CENTER BORDERS. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT WASN'T PLNNING ON SPEAKING OF THIS -- BUT I WANT TO COMMEND. THE SENATOR FROM SANTA BARBARA I THINK HER MOTIVATIONS -- ARE MERITORIOUS ON ON THIS PROPOSED PIECE OF LEGISLATION -- I'M AFRAID HOWEVER THAT WE MIGHT BE BRINGING A PISTOL -- TO A VERBAL JOUST WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS. ONE OF THE PROVISIONS IN HERE I THINK IS. CAN BE DANGEROUS AND THAT IS THE RIGHT. TO CONFRONT YOUR ACCUSERS AND THIS. IN THIS PROPOSED LEGISLATION -- SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGES WHAT WE HAVE PROPERLY UNDERSTOOD AS THE RIGHT TO CONFRONT YOUR ACCUSERS. THIS IS A BEDROCK. COMPONENT OF OUR LEGAL SYSTEM. BUT HERE I THINK WITH THIS PROPOSED LEGISLATION THAT THAT IS NO LONGER THE CASE THAT INDIVIDUAL ACCUSED WILL HAVE TO RELY UPON INTERMEDIARIES IN OTHER FORMS OF COMMUNICATION. TO COMMUNICATE AND DEFEND HIM OR HERSELF. I AGREE WITH THIS WITH CENTER FROM SANTA BARBARA THERE IS AN INTOLERABLE UNACCEPTABLE LEVEL. OF A SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN OTHER MISCONDUCT IN OUR UNIVERSITY SYSTEMS SHE IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT SO MUCH MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE ABOUT IT. BUT I'M NOT ABOUT. TO CARVE OUT AN EXCEPTION OF WHAT WE BELIEVE IS A CONSTITUTIONAL. PROVISION THAT WE ALL ABIDE BY. THE INDIVIDUAL ACCUSE SHOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO FREELY CONFRONT. HIS OR HER ACCUSERS THE CHANGE THAT WOULD BE TO CHANGE THE WAY OUR CONSTITUTIONAL IN JUDICIAL IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM WORK AND THAT IS THE PRICE I'M NOT WILLING TO PAY. I RESPECTFULLY -- WILL BE VOTING AGAINST THIS ENCOURAGE THOSE -- THAT ARE CONCERNED ABOUT CIVIL LIBERTIES TO DO SO AS WELL. THANK YOU CENTER BORDERS FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. SEEING AND HEARING THE ANSWER JACKSON PLEASE CLOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH A MATTER PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES AND I APPRECIATE THE OF I GUESS THE SEMI. RECOGNITION OF THIS BILL -- I WOULD LIKE TO RESPOND SIMPLY BY SAYING THAT WE ARE FOLLOWING CORD DIRECTIVE ON THIS THE COURTS HAVE SAID. THAT THERE IS A RIGHT TO CONFRONT OR AND TO CONSULT AND TO CROSS EXAMINE THE ACCUSED. AND THE ACCUSER TO THE AND VICE VERSA. THERE IS THAT RIGHT BUT THE COURT SAID IT CAN BE DIRECT OR INDIRECT. AND WHAT WE HAVE DONE IS WE HAVE CHOSEN THE INDIRECT ROUTE BECAUSE WE KNOW IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE YOU HAVE UNEQUAL BARGAINING POWER. THAT A VICTIM WHO IS THERE IN A PROCESS STILL PROBABLY SUFFERING -- THE EMBARRASSMENT THE HUMILIATION -- THE THE EMOTIONAL TRAUMA OF HAVING BEEN ASSAULTED BY THE INDIVIDUAL THAT SHE IS HAVING TO CONFRONT IN THIS PROCEEDING. THAT THERE SHOULD BE AN INTERVENOR AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL CALLS FOR AN INDIRECT ABILITY SO THAT THE VICTIM IS NOT SUBJECT TO THE KIND OF ABUSES OR HARASSMENT THAT WE KNOW CAN TAKE PLACE AND DOES TAKE PLACE -- THE COURTS HAVE GIVEN US THIS GUIDANCE WE ARE TAKING THEIR GUIDANCE. IN USING THAT INDIRECT APPROACH AS DIRECTED BY THE COURT AND WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER JACKSON MISTER SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ALLEN. BY ARCHULETA.

SENATE BILL FIVE TWENTY NUMBER SENATOR ALSO AN ACT RELATING TO TENDENCY. SENATOR ALSO. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. SB. TWENTY NINE FIVE TWENTY NINE WILL REQUIRE LANDLORD EVICTING A TENANT. TO HAVE AND STATE THEIR REASON FOR THE VACATION IF. THE TENANT IS IN A TENANT ASSOCIATION CONSISTING OF THREE OR MORE UNITS. OWNED BY THAT LANDLORD. AND THE ASSOCIATION HAS ADOPTED BY LAWS OR AN OPERATING AGREEMENT. BECAUSE MUST BE STATED IN WRITING. AND BE THE DOMINANT MOTIVE FOR THE TERMINATION OR THE FICTION. THIS BILL HAS BEEN NARROWED AND NO LONGER INCLUDES A RENT STRIKE. RENTERS FACE AN INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT REALITY IN CALIFORNIA. NEARLY HALF CALIFORNIANS ARE RENTERS. 44% ARE TRYING TO RAISE THEIR FAMILIES. THE LA TIMES RECENTLY OBSERVED PEOPLE CONTINUE TO FALL INTO HOMELESSNESS OFTEN FOR THE FIRST TIME. BECAUSE OF A RENT STRIKE OR A NEW VISION. SB FIVE TWENTY NINE SEEKS TO EQUALIZE ATTENDANCE VOICE. OUR RENTER'S NEED PROTECTIONS. IN CALIFORNIA HOUSING SHORTAGES HAVE REACHED CRISIS LEVEL. PHIL ALLOWING A VOICE FOR RENTERS IS CRITICAL. SB FIVE TWENTY NINE ALLOWS INDIVIDUALS TO ACT WITHOUT FEAR OF RETALIATION. TO ASK FOR EQUITABLE LIVING STANDARDS TO PROTECT THE SAFETY AND STABILITY OF THEIR FAMILIES. INSEPARABLE FROM OUR VISION OF PRODUCTION PRESERVATION AND PROTECTION. IS A TENANTS ABILITY. TO STAY IN THEIR HOMES. CENTRAL TO THE ABILITY OF INDIVIDUALS TO JOIN TOGETHER IS A SYSTEM. THAT MITIGATES THE RISK OF HARM AND RETALIATION COLLEAGUES THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER DORADO MEMBERS ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE CENTER GROVE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I RESPECTFULLY RISE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL -- SOME RENTAL PROPERTY OWNERS HAVE SUCH A HARD TIME EVICTING BAD TENANTS THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH MONTHS WITHOUT GETTING RENT PAYMENTS THEN THERE'S DAMAGE TO THE PROPERTY. THEY HAVE TO GO TO COURT TO GET INTO A JUDGE TO VICTIMS IN THIS YEAR OF HAS TO SHOW UP AND BY THE TIME ALL THIS HAPPENS. MONTHS AND POSSIBLY SOMETIMES YEARS HAVE GONE THROUGH THE PROCESS BEFORE TENANTS CAN ACTUALLY EVEN VICTOR. OURS HE'S ME LANDLORDS CAN ACTUALLY EVICT BAD TENANTS. SO THIS BILL JUST ADDS TO THAT SITUATION I KNOW THERE ARE SOME -- TENANT ORLANDO LANDLORDS IN MY DISTRICT THAT HAVE HAD SEVERE PROBLEMS EVICTING BAD TENETS THAT OTHER TENANTS COMPLAIN ABOUT. ILLEGAL YOU DRUG USE AND THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON THAT SHOULDN'T BE GOING ON VIOLATION THE PARKING PUTTING FIVE OR SIX CARS AND YOU KNOW A SMALL PARKING AREA BLOCKING OTHER TENANTS FROM PARKING. AND THEY VIOLATE THE RULES INTO AND LANDLORDS ALREADY HAVE A HARD TIME EVEN GETTING TENANTS. AND THAT'S PER CALIFORNIA LAW AND BY THE TIME I SAID YOU GO THROUGH THE COURT PROCESS AT LAST A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. AND IT BECAUSE COSTS A LOT OF MONEY AND IT ALSO HURTS THE TENANTS THAT ARE THEY'RE PAYING THEIR BILLS DOING WHAT'S RIGHT AND FOLLOWING THE RULES SO I WOULD ASK RESPECTFULLY TO OPPOSE THIS BILL. THANK YOU SENATOR GROW FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE SENATOR MINING. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. MEMBERS SOMEONE I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. AS I READ THE BILL. IT SEEKS TO CODIFY ASSOCIATIONAL RIGHTS THAT ARE ALREADY PROTECTED UNDER THE U. S. IN THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTIONS. IT'S MORE SPECIFIC TO RATE THAT WOULD BE AFFORDED TO A GROUP OF TENANTS WHO CONSCIOUSLY FORM AN ASSOCIATION. BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT ALSO RECOGNIZE IT DOES NOT REMOVED FROM A LANDLORD THE ABILITY TO PURSUE IT JUST BECAUSE OF THE ACTION. FOR FAILURE TO PAY RENT TO OR NOT MAINTAINING THE PROPERTY WHATEVER. IT JUSTIN STILLS AS OUR US CONSTITUTION DOES. THE RIGHT TO ASSOCIATE TO PROTECTION IN COLLECTIVE INTERESTS I URGE AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR MINING FURTHER DISCUSSION AND DEBATE CENTER STONE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT -- IT'S INTERESTING THAT I'M I'M CHATTING WITH ONE OF MY CONSTITUENTS IT OWNS A LARGE -- APARTMENT COMPLEX AND TO MAKE A LAW THAT IS -- LOOKING TO INVEST FROM CALIFORNIA LOOKING IN TENNESSEE LOOKING AND IN TEXAS. OF YOU KNOW SOME OF THESE APARTMENT -- ORDERS INVEST -- TENS OF THOUSANDS MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND AND COMPLEXES AND SOMETIMES YOU YOU GET GREAT TENANTS AND SOMETIMES YOU GET. NOT SO GREAT TENANTS SICK DO A LOT OF DAMAGE TO YOUR YOUR PROPERTIES AND THE ELECTION PROCESS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS ONEROUS. EXPENSIVE -- COMES AT A HIGH TAG -- FOR LEGAL FEES -- IN COMPARISON TO JUST HAVE A STATES THAT. IF YOU HAVE A VALID CLAIM SOME DOESN'T PAY THE RENT -- SOMEBODY'S DOING SOMETHING ILLEGAL AND THERE AND THEIR UNIT THAT. INSTEAD OF MONTHS -- IT COULD TAKE A FEW WEEKS. AND YOU CAN CLEAR THAT UNIT UP ALLOWING TENANTS TO ORGANIZE. AND TO I GUESS IN SOME WAYS AND MY BEGIN TURNING TO FORM A KIND OF A CLAUSE LIKE CLASS ACTION SUIT AGAINST THE A LANDLORD THAT -- SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO TO MANAGE AND GOVERNOR PROPERTIES OF THE WAY THEY SEE FIT. CERTAINLY IF A TENANT. DOESN'T LIKE. A RENT DECREASE SERVER DOESN'T LIKE THE THE RULES PUT DOWN BY -- A LANDLORD THAT HE MAY HAVE SIMPLY PUT IN THE AND THE LEAST THAT YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW THE CC AND OURS OF THE EXISTING DEVELOPMENT -- WITH REGARD TO SAY CANNABIS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT -- THERE CAN BE SOME MAJOR DISAGREEMENTS AND AND AND THE LEGAL FEES TO TURN TO MITIGATE THE CIRCUMSTANCES CAN BE OUTRAGEOUS. AND SO YOU KNOW IF YOU ARE UNHAPPY TENANTS -- YOU CAN CERTAINLY FIND OUT OF THE BUILDING. THE FINAL OF THE LANDLORD THAT MIGHT BE MORE ALIGNED TO THE KIND OF LIFE THAT YOU WANT TO LIVE IN A PARTICULAR UNIT. BUT THIS AGAIN IS WHAT I WOULD CALL DEATH BY A THOUSAND SLICES FOR INVESTORS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE'VE GOT THIS BLACK CLOUD. OVER CALIFORNIA WE SEEN IT WAS SICK WELL WE SEE IT WITH PROPERTY RIGHTS -- WE SEE WITH OTHER CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS THAT. PEOPLE ARE JUST GETTING FED UP. AND THEY'RE DIVESTING. I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES THAT I'VE KNOWN -- INCLUDING FAMILY THAT HAVE. COMPLETELY DIVESTED OF THEIR INTEREST IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND MOVE THOSE AS VESTMENTS. VIA. METHODS LIKE TEN THIRTY ONE EXCHANGES AND TAX DEFERRED -- MECHANISMS -- TO GO TO A PLACE WHERE. THE BUSINESS CLIMATE THE IS BETTER SO. YOU KNOW WE CAN CONTINUE DOWN THIS PATH -- BUT MY FRIENDS I'M GONNA. PREDICT THAT. WITHIN A FEW YEARS WE ARE NOT GOING TO SEE THE ROBUST REVENUE STREAMS THAT WE SEE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BECAUSE FRANKLY THE PEOPLE THAT. WANTED TO BE ENTREPRENEURS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WERE STIFLED FROM DOING SO AND THERE'S SO MUCH COMPETITION NOW -- THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES. THERE ARE SO MANY BENEFICIARIES OF OF ENTREPRENEURS THAT WERE FORMALLY FROM CALIFORNIA THAT HAVE MOVED OUT OF THE OUT OF THE STATE. THIS IS JUST ANOTHER REASON NOW. FOR LANDLORDS BIG SMALL. TO SAY ENOUGH. IS ENOUGH. LET US MANAGE OUR PROPERTIES WE WORK OUR HEARTS AND SOULS LIKE SOME OF MY FRIENDS DID AND BUYING ONE PROPERTY AND THEN BUYING TO AND THEN BUYING. THREE AND THEY TRY TO HIM THESE PROPERTIES. THROUGH THEIR GENERATIONS TO THEIR TO THEIR KIDS TO MANAGE TO INVEST IN THEIR PROPERTIES BUT WHEN YOU START TALKING ABOUT RENT CONTROLS AND TENET WRITES THAT -- COULD USE THE LEGAL SYSTEM TO THEIR ADVANTAGE -- WE'RE GOING DOWN A SLIPPERY SLOPE. AND FRANKLY -- ENTREPRENEURS ARE GONNA GO WHERE THERE -- ABLE TO DO BUSINESS AND MAKE A PROFIT I KNOW THAT'S A DIRTY WORD FOR MANY VIEW ON THE FLOOR THE SENATE BUT ACTUALLY MAKE A PROFIT -- THEY'RE GONNA GO WHERE THE PATH OF LEAST RESISTANCE WILL TAKE THEM THIS IS ANOTHER BILL. THE FORCE LANDLORDS THAT HAVE BEEN IN THE STATE FOR MANY MANY YEARS OF PROVIDED QUALITY HOUSING FOR SO MANY. IF YOU START PUTTING THESE C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;&lt;/c&gt;</u> AS A RENT CONTROLS ON THESE LANDLORDS IF THEY DO KEEP THOSE PROPERTIES ARE NOT CAN INVEST IN THOSE PROPERTIES. IF THEY COULD ONLY GET A LIMITED RATE OF RETURN. AND WE'LL HAVE SUBSTANDARD HOUSING FOR MANY PEOPLE MUCH THOSE REASONS ARE TO KNOW THAT SB FIVE OR NINE THANK YOU STUDENTS SENATOR STONE FOR THE DISCUSSION AND DEBATE SENATOR JACKSON. IS THANK YOU AS SOMEONE WHO WAS AT ONE POINT A RELUCTANT LANDLORD I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. I AM FRANKLY TIRED OF HEARING HOW PEOPLE ARE GOING TO LEAVE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS MY GOOD COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES POINTED OUT. THAT THE EXPLAIN WHY THE FOUR OH FIVE FREEWAY IS ALWAYS CONGESTED IF PEOPLE AREN'T LEAVING THEY'RE GOING FROM PLACE TO PLACE I CAN. VOUCH FOR THE ONE A ONE IS BEING IN SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES WITH THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD IF YOU OWN PROPERTY YOU NEED TO BE RESPONSIBLE. FOR PROFITS A GOOD THING AND SEWER PEOPLE AND THIS IS A BILL THAT YOU'RE SIMPLY REINFORCES WHAT IS EXISTING LAW. WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE BAD TENANT WHO'S DESTROYING THE NEIGHBORHOOD OR SHOOTING OFF FIREARMS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LEGALLY ALREADY LEGALLY AUTHORIZED RIGHTS. TO ENSURE THAT LANDLORDS ALSO ABIDE BY THEM. THAT'S ALL THIS BILL DOES. IT ALSO ALLOWS TENANTS TO BE ABLE TO COME TOGETHER AND HAVE A VOICE. AND NOT BE A PUNISH FORD WITH A FICTION. THAT'S ONLY FAIR AND REASONABLE I THINK IN TODAY'S WORLD WHERE THERE ARE FAR TOO FEW UNITS. OF FOR PEOPLE THAN THERE ARE PEOPLE THEMSELVES SO -- AGAIN. IT'S A FICTION WHEN WE KEEP HEARING ABOUT ALL THOSE PEOPLE LEAVING CALIFORNIA WE STILL GOT MORE THAN ENOUGH TO TAKE CARE OF OUR ECONOMY KEEP IT GOING IN A ROBUST FASHION. THIS IS A BILL ABOUT FAIRNESS FAIRNESS DOES NOT MEAN WE CAN'T HAVE PROFIT IT JUST MEANS THERE HAS TO BE PROFIT WITH FAIRNESS AND WITH THAT I ASKED FOR MY VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER JACKSON CENTER BORDERS. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. THE CALIFORNIA VOTERS IN THIS LAST -- ARE IN THIS LAST CYCLE. VOTED DOWN RENT CONTROL. IN MY OPINION. AND I THINK THE MOTIVATIONS OF A THE AUTHOR -- AND I THINK I THINK THE THEY ARE [inaudible] BASED. WITH IN GOOD INTENTIONS. BUT BECAUSE CALIFORNIA VOTERS VOTED AGAINST RENT CONTROL. THIS IS A BACK DOOR TOWARD RENT CONTROL. WHEN YOU CREATE A? FIVE FIVE TENANTS [inaudible] BEGINNING UNITS. IT IS ONLY A MOMENT OR TWO BEFORE YOU'LL START GETTING INTO NEGOTIATING -- ON THE COST OF RENT ITSELF. AND AS A COLLECTIVE MEASURE THAT'S EXACTLY WHERE THIS IS GOING TO GO THIS IS A BACK DOOR TOWARD RENT CONTROL IN. I THINK IN CONTESTS TO WHAT -- THE WILL OF THE CALIFORNIA VOTERS EXPRESS IN THIS LAST CYCLE I WOULD STRONGLY URGE A NO VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER BORDERS FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE SENATOR CABALLERO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM PRESIDENT -- I WAY I DIDN'T PREPARE TO RISE AND SPEAK ON THIS TODAY BUT BUT I FEEL COMPELLED TO DO SO BECAUSE I WANT TO I WANT TO JUST SAY FOR THE RECORD THAT THERE'S NO WAY THAT THIS IS A BACK DOOR TO RENT CONTROL THAT IS NOT. THE INTENT OF OF THE BILL AS I UNDERSTOOD IT -- AND AND QUITE FRANKLY THIS IS REALLY JUST A RESTATEMENT OF WHAT. CURRENT CASE LAW SAYS ABOUT THE RIGHTS OF TENANTS ON THEY ARE IN A VERY DIFFICULT POSITION MANY TIMES WHEN IT COMES TO NEGOTIATING WITH THEIR LANDLORDS OVER -- WHAT WHAT THE CONDITIONS OF THE RENTAL AGREEMENT ARE MANY TIMES IT'S TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT IN IN IN MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES WHERE WE HAVE A VERY VERY LOW VACANCY RATE -- IT'S TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT AND IT'S REALLY VERY EXPENSIVE -- AND AND YOU HAVE NO RIGHT SO -- I I JUST WANT TO COMMEND MY COLLEAGUE FOR FOR THIS BILL I I THINK -- IT IT REALLY IS JUST A A STATEMENT OF WHAT STATE LAW ALREADY ALREADY -- EXPECTS. THANK YOU CENTER CABALLERO SENATOR MORLOCK. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT -- REAL ESTATE IS A WEALTH BUILDING OPPORTUNITY -- BUT IT'S ALSO A LOT OF WORK. LAST YEAR WE HAD PROP TEN ON THE BALLOT WE HAD A HEARING IT WAS INTERESTING TO SEE HOW MANY INDIVIDUALS CAME UP AND SPOKE IN. THAT THEY HAD PURCHASED. A PROPERTY AND THEY'RE READY TO GET OUT -- SO MAYBE WERE ENCOURAGING. PEOPLE. TO JUST BY. INDIVIDUAL HOMES AND AND NOT. CONSOLIDATED BY LARGER. UNITS WITH MORE THAN ONE OR TWO YOU KNOW MAYBE FOR PLEXUS A PLEXUS BE WERE GOING TO DISCOURAGE. THAT A LITTLE BIT WE'RE LOOKING FOR HOUSING. BUT IT RENTAL PROPERTY IS HARD WORK. I'VE BEEN THERE IT'S A IT'S A DIFFICULT TASK IN IN AND IF WE KEEP ADDING MORE -- TO TO THAT. DIFFICULTY THAT DOES NOT BODE WELL FOR CALIFORNIA -- BUT ARE YOU JUST LOOK AT THE LIST OF THOSE THAT ARE OPPOSED TO THIS BILL -- THE WHOLE INDUSTRY IS TELLING YOU THAT THIS IS TOO ONEROUS. AND JUST MAYBE TO ROUTE TO RESPOND TO ONE COMMENT THAT THE NET MIGRATION OUT OF CALIFORNIA. HAS BEEN. DOCUMENTED IN AND WE'RE SEEING MORE PEOPLE MOVE OUT THEN MOVE IN. TWO OTHER STATES FROM OTHER STATES SO SB FIVE TWENTY NINE I I URGE A NO VOTE THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. THANK YOU CENTER MORLOCK SEVERAL THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT IN MEMBERS BOB. I TO AM CONCERNED ABOUT THIS BILL -- SOME WAS RECENTLY SAID HERE ON THE FLOOR THAT IT'S SORT OF A FALLACY THAT YOU KNOW. PEOPLE ARE LEAVING AND THAT KIND OF THING BUT THE HOOVER INSTITUTE THERE ARE -- ECONOMIC THINK TANK OFF THE CAMPUS OF STANFORD -- RECOMMENDED A BOOK TO ME A FEW YEARS BACK IN THE TITLE OF IT WAS HOW MONEY WALKS. THE TALK ABOUT CORPORATIONS LEAVING AS WELL AS INDIVIDUALS AND WHAT'S INTERESTING THE TWO MAIN DEMOGRAPHICS THAT ARE LEAVING ARE HIGHLY EDUCATED YOUNG PROFESSIONALS BETWEEN THE AGES OF TWENTY FIVE AND THIRTY NINE YEARS OLD THE OTHER. ONE IS UPPER MIDDLE CLASS PEOPLE THERE ARE ABLE -- AFFORD TO BE A BELIEVE THE STATE OF COURSE THE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES. AND SO -- I DO THINK WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS IT OR SOME THINGS THAT SHOULD CONCERN US HERE IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS. AS MONEY WALKS -- BUT ALSO ON THIS PROPERTY -- THE BILL RIGHT NOW I I USED TO OWN AND I STILL DO I SHOULD SAY MY WIFE RUNS IT NOW BUT A PROPERTY MANAGEMENT COMPANY. AND SO WE DO KNOW PEOPLE THAT THEIR OWN RENTALS AND AND THOSE TYPES OF THINGS AND AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT WE'VE MET THAT ARE FULLY IN THE STATE -- PROPERTY OWNERS WITH A GOOD NUMBER RENTALS AND THEY'RE GOING -- FOR STATES THAT -- HAVE MORE A LITTLE BIT MORE A LOT MORE ECONOMIC FREEDOM AND AND NOT THE CONSTRAINTS WHICH MAKES IT DIFFICULT -- TO BE ABLE TO COMPETE AND SO ANYWAY FOR THOSE REASONS -- I AM OPPOSED TO THIS BILL -- BECAUSE I JUST AM A BELIEVER IN PROPERTY RIGHTS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU SENATOR MORALE SENATOR GALGIANI. I RISE IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL ON BEHALF OF SOME OF THE MOM AND POPS IN THE STATE WHO HAVE JUST A FEW PROPERTIES AND DON'T HAVE THE FINANCIAL WHEREWITHAL. TO HIRE AN ATTORNEY AND GO TO COURT AND GO THROUGH ALL THAT AND I ALSO RISE ON BEHALF OF THE FAMILY MEMBER OF MINE. WHO HAS A RENTAL PROPERTY IT'S AN OLD VICTORIAN THAT WAS CONVERTED INTO APARTMENTS AFTER WORLD WAR -- TWO RANTS TO THOSE WITH LOW INCOME WHO'S HAD A DEATH THREAT AGAINST HIM AND LET ME TELL YOU MEMBERS THAT WHEN SOMETHING LIKE THAT HAPPENS OTHER TENANTS. IN THE BUILDING ARE FEARFUL TO COME FORWARD AND THEY ARE NOT WILLING. TO TO BE A WITNESS OR TO TESTIFIED TO THE FACT THAT SOMETHING LIKE THAT HAS HAPPENED -- SO I REGRETTABLY RISE TO OPPOSE OPPOSE THE BILL THANK YOU CENTER GALGIANI CENTER BRADFORD. MADAM PRESIDENT I TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE AND I WASN'T GOING TO SPEAK. AS WELL BUT I'M LED TO LEND MY VOICE TO THIS ISSUE BASED ON WHAT'S HAPPENING. IN LOS ANGELES RIGHT NOW. LAST WEEK THEY STARTED AN INVENTION OF A HUNDRED AND TWO YEAR OLD WOMAN WHO HAS LIVED IN A BUILDING FOR THIRTY YEARS. FOR THIRTY YEARS A MOVE THAT WAS SO EGREGIOUS SAID EVEN ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER STEPPED IN TO OFFER THAT LAND SOME TYPE OF SUPPORT. TO THIS WOMAN AND TRUE THE PROPERTY OWNER HAS EVERY RIGHT TO READ HIS PROPERTY TO WHOEVER YOU WANT TO STATE. HE NEEDS TO UNIT BAKARE IT SO HIS DARKER MOVE AND AND I UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE B. MULTI UNIT -- BUILDING SO THEY CAN POSSIBLY RETIRE IN THAT AND THEIR OLD AGE -- LET FAMILY AND FRIENDS MOVE THERE SO IT MAKES SENSE BUT IN A MANNER WHICH THIS WOMAN IS BEING AFFECTED WHERE SHE HAS PAID AROUND ON TIME SHE IS A GREAT TENNIS AGAIN. THE BEEN THERE FOR THIRTY YEARS AND THE REASON HE SAYS IS BECAUSE SHE'S THE ONLY TENANT IN MY BUILDING A HOUSE A MONTH THE MONTH -- AGREEMENT AND HE HE NEEDS FOLKS HAVE LONG TERM RESEARCH LEASE AGREEMENT SO THIS IS COMMON SENSE MEASURE AND AND I STRONGLY US FOR A VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER BRADFORD MEMBERS FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE SEEING AND HEARING NONE SENATOR ALSO YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU TO ALL MY COLLEAGUES TO OF VOICE SUPPORT -- I FIND IT REALLY HARD TO UNDERSTAND. WHY WE WOULD? DEFEND ONLY ONE SIDE WHICH IS THE LANDLORDS. AND NOT CONSIDER. THE MEN AND WOMEN AND THE FAMILIES WHO ARE STRUGGLING TO PAY THEIR RENT. PAID ON TIME MANY TIMES WITH TWO OR THREE JOBS EVEN OUR YOUNG PEOPLE ARE STRUGGLING TO DO THAT. BUT WHAT THIS IS REALLY ALL ABOUT IS SOMETHING THAT'S VERY AMERICAN. AND THAT IS THE RIGHT TO ASSOCIATE WITH OTHERS FOR A COMMON INTEREST. THE DOCTORS HAVE AN ASSOCIATION THE PILOTS HAVE AN ASSOCIATION OUR CAUCUSES HAVE AN ASSOCIATION. WE DO THAT SO THAT IN A REASONABLE BALANCED WAY WE CAN RAISE OUR ISSUES. THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT. IT'S IT'S IT'S DISTURBING TO HEAR. FOLKS DESCRIBE RENTERS AND DEMONIZED. DEMONIZED RENTERS WHO ARE STRUGGLING EVERY DAY -- INSTEAD OF APPRECIATING THAT PART OF CALIFORNIA THE CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE RENTERS WHICH IS MORE THAN HALF OF THE PEOPLE IN THE STATE. TO ASK YOU. TO CONSIDER THAT IN MAKING YOUR DECISION. AND AGAIN. WE'RE SPENDING ENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF MONEY IN. PRODUCTION WE KNOW THAT'S IMPORTANT WE HAVE TO PRODUCE MORE HOUSING. WE HAVE TO PRESERVE WHAT WE HAVE. THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF THE EQUATION. BUT THAT'S GONNA TAKE SEVERAL YEARS TO PRODUCE THE AMOUNT OF HOUSING THAT WE NEED IN THE MEANWHILE RENTERS CALIFORNIANS. CALIFORNIANS ARE ASKING FOR SOME RELIEF ALLOW THEM TO BE ABLE TO JOIN TOGETHER. AND BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT PRESENCE IN THEIR APARTMENT BUILDINGS WITH THEIR LANDLORD AND THAT THE LANDLORD LISTEN TO THEM IN A REASONABLE WAY. SO COLLEAGUES THIS IS NOT ABOUT RENT CONTROL I DON'T CARE WHAT ANYBODY SAYS THIS IS ABOUT WORKING FAMILIES. TRYING TO STAY IN THEIR HOMES AND THERE THEY ARE PART MEN'S.

BUT YOU KNOW WE HAVE SEEN THIS THIS SHIFT IN HISTORY BEFORE BUT I DON'T THINK ONE THIS BIG. IN TERMS OF WHAT WORK IS GONNA LOOK LIKE IN THE FUTURE HOW DO WE PAY FOLKS WHAT IS THE GROWTH RATE BETWEEN THE BOTH OF CAPITOL AGAINST THE GROWTH OF WORK AND HOW DO WE CREATE A SOCIETY THIS BOTH EQUITABLE AND JUST ON HE ONE HAND. STILL INVOLVES PEOPLE WITH THE DIGNITY OF WORK AND YET TAKES ADVANTAGE OF THIS TECHNOLOGY REVOLUTION THAT IS ABSOLUTELY EXTRAORDINARY. WHEN I STARTED SERVING IN GOVERNMENT SOME YEARS AGO WE HAD THESE LITTLE PAGERS OUR PHONES LOOK LIKE BRICKS AND WE DIDN'T HAVE GOOGLE OR ANY OF THIS OTHER FANCY SEMANSKY STUFF AND NOW IT'S OVER TAKE IN OUR LIVES? AND THE RATE OF CHANGE IS SO EXTRAORDINARY I WANT TO JUST ECHO THE AUTHOR'S COMMENTS HERE BECAUSE IT REALLY IS. NOT JUST THE NATURE OF THE CHANGE BUT THE RATE OF CHANGE WE IN GOVERNMENT OFTEN ARE SLOWLY DELIVERED IF AND WE WANT TO BE DELIVERED AND WE WANT TO BE INCLUSIVE WE WANT TO ADD OTHER FOLKS INTO THE PROCESS. AND YET THE RATE OF THIS DISRUPTION IS NOTHING LESS THAN EXTRAORDINARY SO ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT I SUPPORT THIS MEASURE AND HOPE THAT THE COMMISSION ON THE FUTURE OF WORKS. WELL -- WORK WORKS WITH THE DILIGENCE AND DISPATCH NECESSARY TO HAVE A MEANINGFUL INPUT OTHERWISE THERE WILL QUIRK WILL BE YESTERDAY'S NEWS AS WELL AS FOR AN ALBUM. THANK YOU SENATOR HERTZBERG THUNDERSTORM WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU I HEARTILY CONCUR WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY AND APPRECIATE HIS WORK.

A STATE THAT'S NOT JUST BASED ON A GOODS ECONOMY AND ON MANUFACTURING BUT ON A SERVICE SECTOR AND INCREASINGLY ON A DIGITAL ECONOMY THEY REALLY BELIES THIS SORT OF REGIONAL NATURE OF OF OUR ENTIRE GOVERNMENT REGULATORY STRUCTURE SO.

TO REPORT ALLEGATIONS OF PATIENTS SEXUAL ABUSE ANOTHER SEXUAL MISCONDUCT BY MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS TO THE APPROPRIATE STATE LICENSING AUTHORITY WITHIN FIFTEEN DAYS SB FOUR TWENTY FIVE CLOSES LEGAL LOOPHOLES THAT CAN ALLOW A SUBJECT OF REPEATED. SEXUAL ABUSE AND MISCONDUCT COMPLAINTS TO WORK AT A HEALTH FACILITY FOR YEARS BECAUSE THE RELEVANT REGULATORY BOARD IS NOT NOTIFIED BY THE FACILITY. OF THE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST A LICENSEE ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL ABUSE FOR MISCONDUCT BY DOCTORS AND OTHER MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS MUST BE REPORTED SWIFTLY TO THE APPROPRIATE LICENSING BOARD FOR REVIEW. SO THAT REGULATORS CAN DETERMINE WHETHER TO CONDUCT AN INDEPENDENT CONFIDENTIAL INVESTIGATION. JUST BECAUSE AN ALLEGATION IS REPORTED IN NO WAY MEANS THE MEDICAL BOARD WILL AUTOMATICALLY BEGIN AN INVESTIGATION ALL COMPLAINTS SENT TO THE MEDICAL BOARD. ARE COULD CONFIDENTIAL AND FIRST REVIEWED BY A DOCTOR ON STAFF. TO DETERMINE IF FURTHER ACTION IS EVEN WARRANTED. STATE REGULATORY BOARDS CANNOT FULFILL THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES TO PROTECT PATIENTS IN OTHER CONSUMERS IF THEY ARE NOT NOTIFIED OF THESE ALLEGATIONS INVOLVING THEIR LICENSEES. THE FAILURE TO DO SO SHIELDS BAD ACTORS WILL EXPOSING PATIENTS TO GREATER RISKS. AS YOU ARE ALL FAMILIAR WITH THE U. S. C. AND DOCTOR TYNDALL SCANDAL WHERE THERE WERE MULTIPLE COMPLAINTS OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT FOR DECADES. NONE OF THE PRIOR COMPLAINTS WERE REPORTED TO THE MEDICAL BOARD. THIS IS WHY THE MANDATORY REPORTING WITHIN FIFTEEN DAYS TO THE MEDICAL BOARD IS ESSENTIAL WE KNOW THAT HOSPITAL'S TAKING CARE OF THESE ISSUES THEMSELVES DOES NOT WORK. JUST LIKE IT DIDN'T WORK FOR THE LEGISLATURE WHICH IS WHY WE FINALLY CHANGE THAT. I'VE BEEN WORKING DILIGENTLY WITH THE OPPOSITION AND I'M CONFIDENT THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO SATISFY THE REMAINDER OF THEIR CUT MINOR COMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS.

CALIFORNIA'S SHORT LINES HANDLE APPROXIMATELY ONE TENTH OF THE STATE'S CARLOAD FREIGHT. AND ARE A CRITICAL LINK BETWEEN MANY OF THE STATE'S FREE INTENSIVE INDUSTRIES PORTS AND PRINCIPAL TRADE CORRIDORS. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE GIVEN THE INBOUND AND OUTBOUND FREIGHT RAIL TRAFFIC IN CALIFORNIA IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE. BY APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY MILLION TONS BY. TWENTY FORTY WITH THAT PROJECTED GROWTH COMES INCREASES IN TRUCK TRAFFIC AND FREE BOTTLE NECKS WHICH WILL RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN EMISSIONS UNLESS MORE IS DONE TO REHABILITATE THE SHORTLINE RAIL SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA. THE BILL FOLLOWS THROUGH ON THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN CALIFORNIA STATE RAIL PLAN RECOMMENDATION. OF STATE INVESTMENT IN PROGRAMS TO SUPPORT INFRASTRUCTURE AND CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS TO UPGRADE THE STATE WIDE SHORTLINE RAILROAD RAILROAD NETWORK. IMPROVING SHORTLINE RAILROAD INFRASTRUCTURE LIKE TRACK RAIL AND SPURS. AFFORDS LOCALIZE AND STATE WIDE ECONOMIC BENEFITS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR COMMUNITIES THAT SURE ANYONE OF THE TWENTY SHORTLINE RAILROAD RAILROADS LOCATED IN THE STATE. LASTLY I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ADDRESS THE LATE OPPOSITION HAS A RISE IN BY SEVERAL SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES I BELIEVE THAT THERE MAY TWENTIETH LETTER DOESN'T HAVE THE BENEFIT OF UNDERSTANDING AMENDMENTS I TOOK AN APPROPRIATIONS. FOR THE BILL THAT IS BEFORE YOU NOW AS AMENDED ON MAY TWENTY FIRST. FIRST THIS GRANT PROGRAM IS CAPTAIN EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS AND WOULD NOT USE UP ALL THE REMAINING PROP ONE BE FUNDING. SECOND THIS GRANT PROGRAM WILL BE FUNDED FROM THE ON A ON ALLOCATED PROJECTS SAVINGS FROM THE TREE QUARTERS IMPROVEMENT FUND PROGRAM. OF WHICH THERE ARE THIRTEEN MILLION DOLLARS. MY BILL WOULDN'T TOUCH THE THIRTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS THAT ARE CURRENTLY PROGRAMMED BUT REMAINED ON ALLOCATED. THIS GRANT PROGRAM WOULD BE DESIGNED WITH GUIDELINES SET BY THE CALIFORNIA TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION AND EXPECT THAT THEY WILL MAKE SURE THE FRAMEWORK HONORS A WRECK. THE PRESIDENT PREVIOUS ADOPTED IN THE T. C. I. F. PROGRAM. LASTLY I WOULD AGREE THAT THE T. C. I. F.PROGRAM HAS BEEN. A GREAT SUCCESS LEVERAGING OVER TWO BILLION DOLLARS FOR CALIFORNIA STREET CORRIDORS. IN FACT THE CTC ADOPTED THE CLOTHES OUT OF THE PROGRAM AT THEIR AT THEIR MEETING LAST WEEK IN SAN DIEGO AND ADOPTED PLANS FOR SWEEPING ALL REMAINING SAVINGS IDENTIFIED AFTER JUNE. TWENTY TWENTY INTO THE NEWLY CREATED TRADE CORRIDOR ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM. SB FOUR NINE EIGHT WILL KEEP CALIFORNIA COMPETITIVE BY INCENTIVIZING SHORT LINE RAILROADS TO INVEST IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE ABOVE.

THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT A QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR. I DO HER DAUGHTER WE TAKE A QUESTION. PLEASE PROCEED I DID SUPPORT THE BILL GOING FORWARD TO QUESTION IS HAVE WITH THE AMENDMENTS HAVE IT REMOVED THE OPPOSITION. ORIGINALLY THERE WERE ELEVEN CEOS OF THAT TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES IN OUR STATE OPPOSED TO THIS I HAVE YOU REMOVE THE OPPOSITION WITH YOUR AMENDMENTS AND CLARIFICATION. OF THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT'S TO BE REDIRECTED. SO IN REGARDS. TO THE OPPOSITION I DON'T KNOW. WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT AGENCIES HAVE REMOVED THEMSELVES FROM OPPOSITION BUT I KNOW THAT EVERYTHING HAS BEEN LAST MINUTE -- WITH THE OPPOSITION COMING IN AND THE INFORMATION THAT. HAS BEEN -- PROVIDED AND RECEIVED AND SO WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN ON OUR END TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE ALL THE MOST UP TO DATE INFORMATION AND THAT ALL THE INFORMATION THAT THEY HAVE IS ACCURATE -- AND SO WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT ON OUR END AND SO WE ARE HOPING THAT WITH ALL THE INFORMATION AT UP TO DATE THAT THEY RECEIVED THAT BILL REMOVED THEIR OPPOSITION FOR ANY OF THOSE THAT ARE REMAINING. BY MY OWN TIME MEMBER HAS AN IDEA OF SUPPORTED I THINK I WILL REMAIN OFF TODAY -- THE QUESTION IS WHETHER ARE PROJECTS THAT THIS MONEY COULD USE ARE ACTUALLY KNEW OR THEY WERE ALREADY IN THE PIPELINE AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE OF SOME OF THE DIFFERENCE. OCCURS AND I THINK IT WOULD BE VERY IMPORTANT GOING FORWARD. THAT SHOULD THE OPPOSITION KNOB. CONSULTED AND CERTAINLY -- HOPEFULLY NEUTRALIZE BECAUSE THIS IS AN IMPORTANT. ISSUE IN TERMS OF FUNDING THROUGH THE TCI OFF AND I KNOW THAT THE TERMINATES IN. TWENTY TWENTY IS CERTAINLY GOING FORWARD THE TREATY IMPROVEMENT CORD OR ISSUES ARE SIGNIFICANT THROUGHOUT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND CERTAINLY THAT'S WHERE WE HOLD ADDITIONAL PROJECTS CAN BE THE MANY CAN BE DIRECTED. TO SO THANK YOU AND I WILL -- PLAYOFF TODAY THANK YOU THE USER BATES MEMBERS FURTHER DISCUSSION AND DEBATE CENTERVILLE.

SO THIS FUN WILL BE REPLENISHED IN EFFECT -- BY SB ONE IT WILL ADD THREE BILLION DOLLARS FOR TRADE GOOD MOVING PROGRAM.

PRESIDENT A MEMBERS TODAY I'M PRESENTING SB SIX NINETY FIVE WHICH WOULD ALLOW THE CITY TO DEEM A HOUSING UNIT PARTICIPATING IN A HOME SHARING ARRANGEMENT. WITH AT LEAST ONE OR LOW MODERATE INCOME SENIOR OR DISABLED OCCUPANTS AS A VERY LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS FOR THE PURPOSE OF MEETING ITS REGIONAL HOUSING NEED ALLOCATION. LOW INCOME SENIORS WHO FIND THEMSELVES HOMELESS OR ABOUT TO BE HOMELESS ARE HURTING WHETHER THEY ARE RENTERS ARE BUYERS RENTAL UNITS IN CALIFORNIA ARE PRICED WELL BELOW ABOVE 30% OF MANY SENIORS FIXED INCOME. LIKEWISE BUYING OR MAINTAINING A HOUSE HAS BECOME MORE DIFFICULT FOR US SENIORS IN PARTICULAR ON FIXED INCOME THOSE ON FIXED INCOMES OFTEN CANNOT KEEP UP. WITH GROWING COST HOME SHARING OPPORTUNITIES IS A SIMPLE IDEA WHERE HOMEOWNER OFFERS ACCOMMODATIONS TO HOME SHARE IN EXCHANGE FOR GREED LEVEL OF SUPPORT IN THE FORM OF FINANCIAL EXCHANGE ASSISTANCE. I WITH HOUSEHOLD TASKS ARE BOTH FROM SHARING PROGRAMS CAN OFFER MORE SECURE ALTERNATIVE. TO OTHER ROOMMATE OPTIONS VULNERABLE SENIORS OR NEED OF A HOME SHARE ARE FREQUENTLY AFRAID TO ENTER INTO A RENTAL AGREEMENT ON THEIR OWN. HOME SHARING PROGRAMS OFTEN HAVE -- STAFF WERE TRAINED TO CAREFULLY SCREEN EACH PROGRAM APPLICANT -- THROUGH INTERVIEWING BACKGROUND CHECKING AND PERSONAL OF REFERENCES AS WELL AS CASE MANAGERS TO ASSIST -- THE PROGRAM SO INCENTIVIZING CITIES TO INCREASE HOME SHARING OPPORTUNITY IS A PROVEN -- TO OPTION THIS BILL ORIGINALLY WAS BROADER WE'VE NOW IT IT JUST TO THE SENIOR COMPONENT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER PORTANTINO MEMBERS DISCUSSION AND DEBATE SENATOR MITCHELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM PRESIDENT QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR. DO YOU KNOW YOU TAKE A QUESTION. HOW TAKE A QUESTION I HOPE I HAVE THE AT LEAST? FOR I'M SORRY IN ALL DOCTOR ABOUT IT BEFORE HIM BUT JUST THAT THERE IS AN AMAZING NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION LOS ANGELES THAT THAT MANAGES IT'S WHAT YOU TALKED ABOUT HOUSE THE CASE WORKERS TO HELP -- DO PLACEMENT DO THE THE PRE WORK TO MAKE TO THE PLACEMENT IS REALLY A GOOD PLACEMENT. AS I READ THE BILL I'M NOT SURE WHO BENEFITS IT DOES THE NONPROFIT WHO WHO'S ALREADY TRYING TO RAISE MONEY PROBABLY TO BE ABLE TO KEEP UP. WITH THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE IN ORDER TO DO THESE PLACEMENTS THEY BENEFIT OR DOES THE MUNICIPALITY BENEFIT MORE SO -- BY ALLOWING TO COUNT THE SHEER HOUSING UNITS AGAINST THEIR REGIONAL KIND OF THRESHOLD I THINK EVERYONE BENEFITS I THINK THE THE SENIOR BENEFITS BECAUSE BY HAVING MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR HOUSING. I THINK THE NONPROFIT BENEFITS BECAUSE NOW YOU'RE PULLING MULTIPLE INCOMES AND I THINK THE MINISTER POLITY BENEFITS BECAUSE THEY GET TO COUNT THESE TOWARDS THE ARENA NUMBER. SO I THINK IT'S THE INTENT TO BENEFIT ALL THREE COMPONENTS OF THE THING I'LL LOOK SPECIFICALLY HOW IT WORKS FOR THE NONPROFIT BUT I THINK IT'S AN INTENT TO TRY TO MAKE EVERYBODY IN THAT. PROCESS HAVE THE BENEFIT GOT I GUESS JUST MY CONCERN HAVING COME FROM THE NONPROFIT WORLD WE WE WERE ALL OFTEN YOU KNOW THE BENEFICIARIES OF LEGISLATION -- THAT WOULD KIND OF DRIVE WORK OUR WAY BUT NOT THE DISH THE RESOURCES THAT'S AFTER THEY REALLY GET A SENSE OF WHO'S THE WINNER HERE -- AND SO IF YOU WANT FALL WHAT DESPAIR AS I THINK IT'S AN AMAZING IDEA THIS NONPROFIT DOES GREAT WORK. AT LEAST IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES BUT I DON'T WANT TO OVER TAX THEM IF THEY DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO REALLY CARE TO KEEP UP WITH THE DEMAND THAT YOUR BILL MAY HELP CREATE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER MITCHELL CENTER JONES. THANK REPRESENT MASS THE AUTHOR QUESTION PLEASE CENTER PORTANTINO YOU TAKE A QUESTION. OF COURSE PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT -- IN A COMMITTEE WHEN WE VOTE ON THIS BILL IT FOCUSED MORE ON FOSTER YOUTH AND THAT YOU'VE TAKEN FLOOR AMENDMENTS. TO CHANGE THE FOCUS TO ELDERLY AND I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD EXPLAIN. THE PURPOSE FOR THE CHANGE IT HAD TWO COMPONENTS AND WE JUST NARROWED IT. TO ONE ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU CENTER JONES SAWYER CABALLERO. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT -- I'M GOING -- TO OPPOSE ABILITY AT THIS PARTICULAR POINT IN TIME AND I I AM WITH WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO MY MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOOKING OUT I DID HEAR THIS IN COMMITTEE AND I ICE I VOTED TO SUPPORT IT MOVING BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS WORTH THE CONVERSATION. BUT AND I ALSO WANT TO SAY THAT THE RINA PROCESS IS FRAUGHT WITH PROBLEMS AND IT'S A VERY POLITICAL PROCESS WHERE YOU YOU KNOW ONE COMMUNITY AS WE WANT TO HAVE. ANY AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND SO THEY FORCE IT ON ANOTHER COMMUNITY AND THEY GET THE VOTES TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT. BUT BUT BUT IS IN PERFECT IS IT IS IT'S WHAT WE HAVE IT AND I HESITATE TO START ANY PROGRAM AND I ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT. SENIOR HOMELESSNESS IS THE LARGEST GROWING SEGMENT OF THE POPULATION IN OUR STATE AND NOT REALLY TROUBLES ME BECAUSE UP FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE WORKED THEIR ENTIRE LIFE AND END UP HOMELESS AT THE END. IS IS HEARTBREAKING I THINK MY MY GOOD FRIEND -- FROM LOOKING OUT IS IS GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION I JUST THINK THERE HAS TO BE ACCOUNTABILITY. AND AND ACCOUNTABILITY MEANS OR HAS TO BE A SYSTEM SET UP. SO THAT YOU CAN VERIFY. THAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY MEETING PARTY ARENA NUMBERS AND YOU CAN -- YOU UTILIZE A NON PROFITS THEY'RE ACTUALLY DOING THE WORK TO BE ABLE TO PUT TOGETHER PEOPLE END UP -- TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WORKS AND SO I I THINK IT SAID IT BEFORE IT'S TIME. I WANT TO ENCOURAGE -- MORE THOUGHT ON THIS BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT WE HAVE A SERIOUS HOUSING CRISIS SHORTAGE. AND AND AND THERE'S NO WAY TO VERIFY -- THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE ACTUALLY OPENING THEIR HOMES AND IN DOING LONG TERM AGREEMENTS TO BE ABLE TO HOUSE PEOPLE I JUST DON'T THINK THAT WE CAN AFFORD. TO MESS WITH THE READING A PROCESS AT THIS PARTICULAR POINT IN TIME SO I WOULD RECOMMEND IN OVER. THANK YOU CENTER CABALLERO ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE SING DANCE IN A PORTANTINO JOINT TO CLOSE -- I THINK THEY NEED TO HAVE TO HELP THE SENIOR POPULATION IS IMPORTANT I THINK THE VERIFICATION AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMES THROUGH CITIES WANTING TO ACTUALLY MAKE THIS WORK -- I THINK IT'S A GOOD BILL I THINK THE SENIOR COMMUNITY WHICH BROUGHT IT TO ME -- SEES THE NEED AND HOPEFULLY RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE.

I THIRTY FOUR KNOWS TO THE MEASURE PASSES MEMBERS WERE MOVING ON TO FILE ITEM SIXTY NINE SENATOR GLAZER. MISTER SECRETARY PLEASE READ. SENATE BILL TWO BY SENATOR GLAZER AN ACT RELATING TO STUDENT DATA. CENTER GLAZER THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS. SB TWO IS A BILL THAT WOULD CREATE A STATEWIDE DATA SYSTEM TO TRACK. INDIVIDUAL STUDENT PROGRESS FROM PRESCHOOL THROUGH COLLEGE AND INTO THE WORK FORCE. CALIFORNIA COLLECTS A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF DATA ABOUT STUDENTS HOWEVER THE DATA THAT WE DO COLLECT IS MAINTAINED. IN SYSTEMS THAT ARE NOT CONNECTED. AND AS A RESULT OF THESE DISCONNECTS. IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT STUDENT PROGRESS. IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO ACCESS. THESE INFORMATION GAPS ARE A SIGNIFICANT WEAKNESS. IN OUR APPROACH TO MAKING GOOD CHOICES ABOUT STUDENT PROGRESS IN OUTCOMES. OUR FUTURE STUDENTS WILL BE GUIDED -- TO CLEAR PATHWAYS IF IF WE KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENED TO THEM IN THE PAST. THAT DATA IS KEY TO POINTING THEM AND US IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION IN THE CHOICES WE MAKE. AS POLICY MAKERS WITH THAT MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU CENTER GLAZER MEMBERS ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. SEEING AND HEARING NONE SENATOR MORLOCK. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. I'M JUST A CURIOUS ABOUT THIS BILL I KNOW THAT WE NEED TO IMPROVE OUR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM US NEWS AND WORLD REPORT RANKED CALIFORNIA. TWENTY FIRST WITH ITS K. THROUGH TWELVE AND THIRTY ENTERS HIS BEING RANKED. WAS RANKED TWENTY FIRST WITH THIS K. THROUGH TWELVE A THIRTY SEVENTH BUT BECAUSE OF OUR UNIVERSITY SYSTEM IN FOURTH PLACE -- THE AVERAGE CAME OUT TO TWENTY FIRST IN USA TODAY. HAS IS A THIRTY FIFTH FARM. KIND OF SCRATCHING MY HEAD ON WHY WE NEED TO DO A MASSIVE DATABASE AND HOW WOULD MOVE UP. OUR SYSTEMS ARE SCHOOL SYSTEMS IN THE RANKINGS. I'M ALSO WONDERING WHERE THE MONEY TO PROVIDE FOR THE FUNDING COME FROM PROP NINETY EIGHT REVENUES. I'M ALSO CURIOUS IF THE PROPOSED TEN MILLION DOLLARS. COULD MAYBE BE SPENT BETTER BY PROVIDING INCENTIVES FOR HIGHER PERFORMING TEACHERS. AND A WHAT ELSE TELLS ME A INTRIGUED IS WHY THE COURAGEOUS STATE SENATOR. IS IS PROPOSING THIS LEGISLATION AS OPPOSED TO PERHAPS THE STATE'S DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. AND IT'S ELECTED SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION. AND WILL THE CONCLUSION MANY MANY YEARS FROM NOW BE A REQUEST FOR MORE FUNDING. FOR SCHOOL SYSTEMS BECAUSE THE COMPREHENSIVE ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORTS OF OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS INDICATE CORPUS GO MANAGEMENT. WITH SACRAMENTO CITY SCHOOL DISTRICT AS A GREAT EXAMPLE. COLLEAGUES THE CURRENT SCHOOL DISTRICT FUNDING MECHANISMS IN THE CURRENT TEACHER COMPENSATION PACKAGES ARE NOT WORKING IF THE FACTORY IS BROKEN WHY TRACK THE PRODUCT. SITE CONSEQUENTLY I I REQUEST A NO VOTE THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. THANK YOU SENATOR MORLOCK. SEE CENTER JACKSON. QUESTION THE AUTHOR FINE MAY CENTER GLAZER EXCEPT QUESTION THANK YOU THERE IS SOME CONCERN EXPRESSED BY THE ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION THAT WE'RE GONNA BE AMASSING. LOTS OF INFORMATION ABOUT THESE YOUNGSTERS ANNA SOMEONE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE ACCUMULATION OF PERSONAL DATA PARTICULARLY OF REGARDING YOUNG PEOPLE -- COULD YOU DISCUSS WHAT ARE THE PROTECTION SO ARE YOU ARE PLANNING TO PUT IN PLACE OF THAT THIS INFORMATION. IS NOT AGGREGATED AND USED IN WAYS THAT ARE OTHER THAN WHAT THIS BILL PURPORTS TO DESIGN THEM TO DO. GREAT WELL -- THROUGH THE CHAIR THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION -- IT IS A REQUIREMENT OF THE BILL THAT. THE WORK THAT'S DONE TO CONSOLIDATE THESE DATA SYSTEMS. AND A NEEDS SILO EDUCATION SYSTEM REPORTS COLLECTED. BUT AS WE BRING IT TOGETHER IN AN ACCUMULATION THAT ALL EFFORTS ARE MADE TO PROTECT THE PRIVACY OF THE INDIVIDUALS HAT. NONE OF THAT DATA IS TRACKED AS A PERSON BUT RATHER AS A NUMBER AND THAT'S REALLY PART OF THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE AND WHY THESE SYSTEMS ARE COMMUNICATING BECAUSE THE NUMBERS THAT A PERSON'S ASSIGNED TO TO PROTECT THAT PRIVACY. IS A DIFFERENT NUMBER IN A DIFFERENT SYSTEM SO THIS BILL I IDENTIFIES THAT TASK FORCE TO TO WORK TOGETHER TO CREATE THIS. HOLIDAY DATA SYSTEM THE BILL CALLS OUT PRIVACY IS A REQUIREMENT FOR THE WORK THAT THEY DO AND IT IS A VERY IMPORTANT COMPONENT. THAT THAT THAT PRIVACY BE PROTECTED THANK YOU FOR MY OWN TIME THE ISSUE OF PRIVACY IS ONE THAT'S RAISED EVERY. TIME WE LOOK AT THIS ISSUE BECAUSE IT DOES HAVE THE ABILITY TO STUDY IT THE STUDENTS PROGRESS LONGITUDINALLY -- WILL IMPACT THE SUCCESS OF THEIR EDUCATION -- SO -- I WOULD RESPECTFULLY HAVE TO DISAGREE WITH MY GOOD COLLEAGUE FROM ORANGE COUNTY THIS IS A TOOL THAT IT COULD VERY WELL BE. A GREAT SOURCE OF ASSISTANCE TO OUR STUDENTS AND TO OUR TEACHERS IN THAT WHOLE PROCESS. BUT I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE PRIVACY ELEMENT HERE -- SO WITH THE RECORD -- WITH THE REPRESENTATIONS MADE BY THE GOOD -- CENTER FROM. ORINDA. CONTRA COSTA COUNTY -- I WILL SUPPORT THIS BILL BUT AS IT MOVES TOWARD I HOPE THAT YOU WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TO ASSURE THAT ALL PRIVACY RIGHTS ARE NOT ONLY PROTECTED. BUT AGAINST THE BREACHES SO WE DO SEE RATHER REGULARLY -- THIS IS INFORMATION THAT DOES NOT BELONG IN THE HANDS OF ANYONE OTHER THAN OUR EDUCATION COMMUNITY AND AGAIN HOPEFULLY IN A NON IDENTIFY PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE WAY. EXCEPT AS NECESSARY TO ASSIST THESE YOUNG PEOPLE IN THEIR EDUCATION. THANK YOU CENTER JACKSON CENTER STERN. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AS ONE ARISE BRIEFLY IN SUPPORT THE MEASURE I KNOW FOR YEARS HERE. WE'VE BEEN -- SORT OF HIDING OUR EYES TO HOW WE'RE DOING SOMETIMES IN OUR PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM AND WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FATE OF MANY STUDENTS IS AND HOW THEY DO -- WE'VE LEFT FEDERAL MONEY ON THE TABLE OVER THE YEARS I THINK IT'S HIGH TIME WE CORRECTED THAT ESPECIALLY IF WE'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT THE FUTURE OF WORK. TO GO FURTHER UP THAT PIPELINE AND LOOK AT HOW STUDENTS ARE FARING IN OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM IN AND KNOW WHAT KINDA JOBS THEY'RE GETTING THEMSELVES PREPARED FOR WE NEED TO KNOW. WHAT THE OUTCOMES ARE SO I THINK IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT MEASURE IN APPRECIATE SHIPPING AND? FOR THANK YOU CENTER STERN SENATOR BATES. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I'D LIKE TO RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE I THINK IT'S SO IMPORTANT AS WE LOOK TO THE FUTURE. AND THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE THERE FOR OUR YOUNG PEOPLE ARE CURRENTLY IN SCHOOL WITH THE ADVANCE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCEROBOTICS -- WHAT JOBS ARE GOING TO BE THERE WHAT CHARTER SCHOOLS BE PROVIDING OUR CHILDREN ARE BEGINNING IN KINDERGARTEN I SEE IT AS A POSITIVE MEASURE? OUR CONCERNS EXPRESSED CERTAINLY ARE THERE BUT I THINK THE AUTHOR HAS ADEQUATELY ADDRESS THOSE FOR THE PRESIDENT AND IT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO SEE. I THINK A WORK IN PROGRESS MOVING FORWARD WILL BE VERY VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATION. FOR THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER BATES THERE GOES A WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE AT THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS I CERTAINLY WANT TO THANK THIS SENATOR FROM SANTA BARBARA FROM RAISING THE PRIVACY ISSUE IN. THE LEGISLATION SPECIFICALLY SAYS THAT PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION COLLECTED FOR STORED IN OUR USE FROM THE DATABASE IS CONFIDENTIAL. AND SHOULD NOT BE DISCLOSED I AND IT GOES ON FURTHER TO SAY THAT. THAT THE STATE HAS TO FOLLOW ALL STATE AND FEDERAL RULES IN TERMS OF PRIVACY AND SO I KNOW IT'S UP TO US TO PROTECT THAT PRIVACY WITHIN OUR STATE RULES AND AND THERE'S ALSO FEDERAL REGULATIONS THAT. REQUIRE IT AND I THINK THERE'S COMFORT IN KNOWING THAT THIS IS A PROVISION OF THIS LEGISLATION GOING FORWARD. AT THE SENATOR FROM ORANGE COUNTY -- GIVES ME THE OPPORTUNITY. TO TO MENTION TO HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE THE LEADERSHIP FROM GOVERNOR NEWSOME ON THIS ISSUE. HE'S TALKED ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF LONGITUDINAL DATA HE HAS PUT IN HIS BUDGET TEN MILLION DOLLARS TO IMPLEMENT. A LONGITUDINAL DATA SYSTEM SO MONEY IS BEEN ALLOCATED FOR AT THAT LONGITUDINAL DATA GOES BEYOND K. THROUGH TWELVE THE SENATOR MENTIONS IS CONCERNED ABOUT. LEADERSHIP FROM THE K. TO TWELVE COMMUNITY THEY DO WORK IN THAT COMMUNITY -- ON COLLECTING DATA ANDTRYING TO LEARN FROM IT BUT THIS MEASURE GOES BEYOND THAT IT GOES TO PRESCHOOL IT GOES INTO THE COLLEGE SYSTEM THAT GOES INTO THE WORK FORCE. AND CONNECTING ALL THAT TOGETHER IS WIDELY LEADERSHIP FOR THINGS LIKE THIS NEED TO COME FROM US FROM OUR GOVERNOR FROM THE SENATE. SIDE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF WHAT THIS INFORMATION TEACHES US ABOUT HOW WE CAN DO OUR WORK BETTER. TO MAKE EVERY PERSON SUCCESSFUL EVERY STUDENT SUCCESSFUL IN WHATEVER PATHWAY -- THEY DECIDE TO GO DOWN -- SO I APPRECIATE THE FOR THE SUPPORT FROM THE SENATOR FROM LAGUNA MIGUEL. AND FROM THE MY FRIEND FROM VENTURA AND FOR ALL OF YOU WHO WORK TOGETHER WITH THE STUDENTS -- COMMIT SENATE COMMITTEE ON STUDENT SUCCESS. TO HOLD A HEARING SPECIFICALLY ON THIS ISSUE AND CRAFTED THIS BILL INTO ITS FORM THAT WE SEE TODAY WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE.

FIVE THREE SEVEN NO ZERO THE MEASURE PASSES MEMBERS WE'RE GOING TO MOVE BACK ON FILE ITEM ORDER TO FILE ITEM. TWELVE SENATOR WIENER MISTER SENATE BILL ONE THIRTY SIX BY SENATOR WINNER AND ACTOR LINDA SENTENCING. SENATOR WIENER. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH I REPEAL IS A COMMON COSTLY. AND INEFFECTIVE ONE YOUR ENHANCEMENT THAT APPLIES FOR EACH PRIOR FELONY. TERM OR FELONY COUNTY JAIL TERM OF IMPRISONMENT THAT INDIVIDUAL HAS SERVED -- THE ENHANCEMENT IS IS NOT TRIGGERED BY A PRIOR FELONY CONVICTION. BUT RATHER ONLY IF THE PERSON SERVE TIME FOR THE PRIOR CONVICTION. THIS ONE YOUR ENHANCEMENT -- AND COSTS EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER ENHANCEMENT BECAUSE THE COST EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. TO INCARCERATE SOMEONE FOR A YEAR. MORE THAN FIFTEEN THOUSAND STATE PRISON SENTENCES CURRENTLY HAVE THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. AND THAT'S IN ADDITION TO A LARGE NUMBER OF COUNTY JAIL TERMS THAT HAVE THE ENHANCEMENT. SO IF YOU DO THE MATH. THAT'S ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS THAT THE TAXPAYERS ARE PAYING FOR THIS ENHANCEMENT. THIS IS A PERVASIVE SENTENCING ENHANCEMENT BUT DOES LITTLE OR NOTHING TO IMPROVE PUBLIC SAFETY BUT COST US DEARLY. THIS ONE YOUR ENHANCEMENT IS A RATIONAL INDICTED ONLY APPLIES IF THE PRIOR FELONY WAS PUNISHED BY JAIL TIME. SO IF YOU HAVE AN OFFENDER WITH MULTIPLE FELONY OFFENSES ON THEIR RECORD. BUT WHAT IF THAT OFFENDER WAS SENTENCED TO PROBATION PREVIOUSLY INSTEAD OF JAIL TIME. THEY'RE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR THIS ENHANCEMENT. BUT IF SOMEONE WITH A MORE SERIOUS PRIOR FELONY CONVICTION. SERVICE EVEN A SMALL AMOUNT OF TIME IN JAIL. THEY ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR THE ENHANCEMENT. ONLY IF A PERSON SERVICE TIME THIS DISTINCTION IS COMPLETELY IRRATIONAL. WHAT IS A RISE? WHAT THIS A RATIONALITY ACCOMPLISHES OF COURSE IS TO EXACERBATE RACIAL AND ECONOMIC DISPARITIES? IN OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. THE TWO STICKS SO THAT AFFLUENT WHITE MALE IS FAR MORE LIKELY TO BE SENTENCED TO PROBATION AND THUS NOT ELIGIBLE FOR THIS ENHANCEMENT. AS OPPOSED TO JAIL OR PRISON TIME. A PERSON OF COLOR LOWER INCOME PERSON IS MUCH MORE LIKELY TO BE SENTENCED. TO JAIL OR PRISON TIME AND THUS BE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS ENHANCEMENT. THIS DOESN'T MAKE SENSE FOR OUR SYSTEM. COLLEAGUES I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE BEEN TARGETED BY AN AGGRESSIVE CAMPAIGN BY OPPONENTS OF THE BILL. IMPLYING OR EVEN EXPLICITLY STATING. THAT REPEALING THIS ENHANCEMENT WILL MAKE IT HARDER TO PROSECUTE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND CHILD ABUSE REPEAT OFFENDERS. I'M REALLY IT'S SURPRISING TO HEAR THAT BECAUSE IT IS ABSOLUTELY UNTRUE. CALIFORNIA HAS VARIOUS IS SENTENCING ENHANCEMENTS THAT ARE SPECIFIC TO DO REPEAT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE OFFENDERS AND REPEAT CHILD ABUSE OFFENDERS. FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE THE PENAL CODE SPECIFICALLY ALLOWS A HIGHER BE SENTENCE UP TO THREE YEARS HIGHER FOR A SECOND. OR SUBSEQUENT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CONVICTION. AND ON TOP OF THAT IF THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RESULTS IN SKIN GREAT BODILY INJURY. THE COURT HAS THE DISCRETION TO IMPOSE. A FIVE YEAR ENHANCEMENT THAT IS SPECIFIC TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. REPEALING THIS ENHANCEMENT TODAY WILL NOT UNDERMINE ANYWAY JUDGES ABILITY TO PUNISH REPEAT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE OFFENDERS HARSHLY. REGARDING CHILD ABUSE THE PENAL CODE PROVIDES A FOUR YEAR ENHANCEMENT FOR A SECOND OR SUBSEQUENT FELONY CHILD ABUSE OFFENSE. AND ON TOP OF THAT FOR YOUR ENHANCEMENT THE PENAL CODE PROVIDES AN ADDITIONAL THREE YEAR ENHANCEMENT. IF GREAT BODILY INJURY WAS INFLICTED ON THE CHILD AND A FIVE YEAR ENHANCEMENT IF GREAT BODILY INJURY WAS INFLICTED ON A CHILD. UNDER FIVE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. AND CHILD ABUSE REPEAT OFFENDERS HAVE THEIR OWN MUCH HARSHER ENHANCEMENTS. ON THIS ONE YOU'RE ENHANCEMENT. SB ONE THIRTY SIX CHANGES NINE OF THESE PUNISHMENTS OR ENHANCEMENTS -- AT ALL AND TO SUGGEST THAT THIS UNDERMINES OUR ABILITY TO PUNISH THESE OFFENDERS AROUND THE MASSIVE VIOLENCE AND CHILD ABUSE. IS MISLEADING ABOUT STE. OPPONENTS ARE ALSO ADVANCING THE NARRATIVE THAT REPEALING THIS ENHANCEMENT WILL SOMEHOW REDUCE JUDICIAL DISCRETION IN SENTENCING. BUT IS ALSO UNTRUE AS JUDGES WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT DISCRETION AND IMPOSING SENTENCES ON REPEAT OFFENDERS. HI. WE KNOW THAT IN VARIOUS RESPECTS WHETHER IT IS IMPOSING THE LOWER MID OR HIGH RANGE OF A SENTENCE OR OTHER ENHANCEMENTS AND THEIR ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY OTHER ENHANCEMENTS. BY JUDGES WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE DISCRETION. AND SPECIFIC TO SERIOUS AND VIOLENT FELONIES. BY THERE IS A SEPARATE FIVE YEAR ENHANCEMENT. FOR REPEAT OFFENDERS AND YOU CAN'T IMPOSE BOTH THE ONE YEAR AND THE FIVE YEAR AND SO THIS ONE YEAR ENHANCEMENT IS NOT GOING TO REPEALING IT WILL NOT UNDERMINE. THE ABILITY OF JUDGES TO SEVERELY PUNISH REPEAT SERIOUS AND VIOLENT OFFENDERS. MORE BROADLY SPEAKING COLLEAGUES WE ARE TRYING TO MOVE AWAY FROM CALIFORNIA'S UGLY HISTORY OF MASS INCARCERATION. OUR STATE ONE FROM TWENTY THOUSAND STATE INMATES IN. NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT WITH A QUADRUPLING OF THE RATE OF INCARCERATION. AND FOCUSING DISPROPORTIONATELY ON BLACK AND LATINO PEOPLE TEARING APART FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES. CALIFORNIA BILL TWENTY THREE NEW STATE PRISONS TO HOLD THIS BURGEONING POPULATION. AND IN THE PROCESS FOR MANY YEARS WE SPENT MORE ON OUR PRISON SYSTEM THAN ON CSU AND YOU SEE COMBINED. BY IN RECENT YEARS WE'VE BEEN WORKING AS A STATE TO REPAIR THE DAMAGE TO OUR BUDGET AND TO OUR COMMUNITY SAID HAS BEEN INFLICTED BY THIS BAD SYSTEM. WE CAN HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR BEHAVIOR. WITHOUT EXCESSIVELY LONG SENTENCES TO DESTROY PEOPLE'S LIVES. TURNING A TWO YEAR BASS SENTENCE FOR A LOW LEVEL CRIME IN TWO OR THREE OR FOUR OR FIVE YEAR SENTENCE JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. RESEARCH ALSO SHOWS THAT THESE ENHANCEMENTS ARE INEFFECTIVE. IT DOES NOT MAKE US SAFER. COLLEAGUES SP ONE THIRTY SIX PUTS AN END TO THIS A RATIONAL INEFFECTIVE COSTLY AND UNNECESSARY SENTENCING ENHANCEMENT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR DR -- THANK YOU SENATOR WIENER MEMBERS DISCUSSION AND DEBATE SENATOR NIELSEN. THAT A PRESIDENT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THE SENATE. THIS ISN'T SO MUCH ABOUT MONEY IT'S ABOUT JUSTICE [inaudible] JUSTICE. AND CONSEQUENCES GO HAND IN HAND. AND CONSEQUENCES MEAN. IF YOU IMPROVE. THE CONSEQUENCES IMPROVE. IF YOU DO NOT. THE CONSEQUENCES INCREASE. THAT'S WHAT THIS IS REALLY ALL ABOUT THE ENHANCEMENTS. ONE OF THE DEFICIENCIES OF TERM LIMITS IS LACK OF INSTITUTIONAL MEMORY OR INTELLECTUAL CURIOSITY OF WHAT WENT ON BEFORE. AND IN SENTENCING THROUGH THE SEVENTIES. WE WERE UNDER SOMETHING WAS CALLED THE INDETERMINATE SENTENCE. THAN A PROBOARDS MADE MOST ALL THE DECISIONS WHETHER OR NOT AND WHEN SOMEONE WOULD BE RELEASED. BOTH LIBERALS AND CONSERVATIVES. DIDN'T LIKE THAT. AND SOUGHT A CHANGE. TO A DETERMINATE SENTENCE SYSTEM. FOR THE CONSERVATIVES THEN THEY WOULD NOT HOLD THAT THIS INDIVIDUAL WOULD SERVICE SO MUCH TIME. AND THE BE LESS. THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO GET OUT CALLED EARLY. THE MORE LIBERAL PERSUASION. WERE ENTICED BECAUSE THE INMATE WOULD KNOW WHEN THEY WOULD BE RELEASED SO WHAT PASSED. AND BOTH SIDES INCLUDING THE GOVERNOR WHO SIGNED THAT LEGISLATION. LIVE TO RUE THE DAY. THE GOVERNOR EVEN SAID THAT. IT WAS A MISTAKE. WE WENT OVER THEN AND NOW THROUGH WHAT'S CALLED REALIGNMENT. NOW AS TO SAVING MONEY THAT CAN GO IN THE HIGHER EDUCATION. WE'VE BEEN IN THE THROES OF THIS REALIGNMENT OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM FOR ABOUT FIVE YEARS NOW. IN THOSE FIVE YEARS GUESS WHAT IN CONSERVATION COST OF DONE CALIFORNIA [inaudible] GOT UP. THE SO CALLED RE ALIGNMENT DIVIDEND. MY TERM. DID NOT HAPPEN. THE COST OF INCREASED. THERE WILL BE ARGUMENTS BUT THE REASONS BUT THAT IT INCREASED. CANNOT BE ON NOW. IN TERMS OF REPETITIVE BEHAVIOR THEIR TWO THINGS THAT I MENTIONED. REPETITIVE BEHAVIOR. AN ESCALATING BEHAVE. THAT MEANS IF YOU KEEP DOING THE SAME THING EVEN THOUGH IT MAY BE A LOWER LEVEL [inaudible] DRUG OFFENSE. THAT'S SHOWING CONCRETION DISREGARD. FOR THE LAW THE CONSEQUENCES. VIOLATING THE LAW. ESCALATING BEHAVIOR THERE'S ONLY TAKE THAT NEXT STEP. THE BETTER EXAMPLE IS A PERSON THAT. FIRST THEY JUST GRAB AND RUN. THEN THEY GRAB AND RUN. THE WOMAN RESIST. AND SHE GETS BEAT [inaudible] ESCALATING BEHAVIOR. THE ENHANCEMENTS AFTER THE PASSAGE. THE DETERMINANT SENTENCE LAW. WERE PUT. ON THE BOOKS. BY SUCCESSIVE LEGISLATORS. GOVERNORS AND EVEN THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. FAIRLY RECENTLY IN FACT. THE MARSHES LAW. THE PEOPLE HAVE ACCEPTED THAT YES SIR DO NEED TO BE INCREASING CONSEQUENCES FOR REPETITIVE BEHAVIOR. AND THAT'S VERY SIMPLY WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT. IF YOU VOTE FOR IT. DON'T HARBOR IN THE EXPECTATIONS AT CSU AND YOU SEE ARE GONNA GET RATE INCREASES IN THE BUDGET NEXT YEAR. THEY HAVE A NOR WILL THEY LET'S THINK ABOUT. CONSEQUENCES AND JUSTICE. THANK YOU CENTER NIELSEN CENTER SKINNER. THANK YOU AYE MADAM PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL [inaudible] AND I HAVE IN MY HANDS. THE SEVEN PAGES AND YOU CAN SEE THE SIZE OF A OF ALL OF THE SECTIONS OF THE PENAL CODE. FOR WHICH CALIFORNIA OVER THE YEARS HAS ADDED AN ENHANCEMENT. NOW I ASK THE LA. BECAUSE YOU KNOW VERY COMMONLY WHEN WE DISCUSS THESE ITEMS THERE'S A LOT OF A LOT OF PEOPLE CERTAIN THINGS. AND IT'S NOT OFTEN CLEAR WHETHER IT'S ACCURATE SO I ASKED THE LA -- TO GIVE ME SOME ESTIMATES. OF THE NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL YEARS THAT ARE NOW BEING SERVED TO DO ENHANCEMENTS I ALSO ASKED HIM TO GIVE ME AN ESTIMATE. OF THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE CURRENTLY INCARCERATED. THAT. HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY ONE OR MORE OF THESE ENHANCEMENTS IN AS I SAID. THERE ARE. A HUNDRED AND FIFTY OF THEM. WHICH THIS BILL DOESN'T COVER ALL BUT THEY'RE STILL ON THE BOOKS HUNDRED FIFTY AND THEY RANGE SOME OF THE MAD. ONE YEAR SOME OF THEM OUT UP TO FIVE YEARS OTHERS OUT UP TO TEN YEARS. IN SOME OUTSIDE MULTI GUIDE GIVE CHOICES OF A NUMBER OF YEARS ADDED. IT'S FEWER THAN ONLY ADD ONE YEAR. ANYWAY SO I ASKED THE ONLY -- TO TO GIVE ME SOME NUMBERS LIKE THAT AND I ASKED THEM WHAT WAS THE COST. TO CALIFORNIANS DUTIES. THE REASON I ASK THAT IS BECAUSE AS CHAIR OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE ON PUBLIC SAFETY. I HAVE OBSERVED THAT. OVER THE YEARS EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE -- THROUGH REALIGNMENT AND OTHER THINGS. REDUCE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT ARE SERVING IN OUR STATE PRISONS OUR COST. CONTINUES TO GO UP TO THE POINT NOW THAT WE ARE SPENDING SOME THIRTEEN BILLION DOLLARS. ON JUST THE STATE PRISONS MORE THAN WE ARE SPENDING ON OUR HIGHER EDUCATION. AND WHEN I COMPARE IF I GIVE THE EXAMPLE OF WE HAVE I'M SURE ALL OF OUR OFFICES HAVE GOTTEN LETTERS FROM THE UC SYSTEM. INDICATING THAT JUST BY IN ADDITION I BELIEVE OF I COULD BE THE IT'S EITHER FORTY MILLION OR HUNDRED MILLION I'M FORGETTING EXACTLY WHICH FIGURE WE COULD. BUY OUT THE THE TUITION INCREASES THAT THEY HAD BEEN CONSIDERING FOR MULTIPLE YEARS NOT JUST ONE YEAR. AND WE COULD GREATLY INCREASE THE NUMBER OF CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. THEN PERHAPS WE WOULD AVOID CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE WHAT WE'VE JUST RECENTLY SEEN WE'RE ALREADY WE HAVE AND WEALTHY CALIFORNIANS TRYING TO BUY THEIR WAY. INTO OUR UC SYSTEM BECAUSE WE DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH SLOTS. ANYWAY LET ME GO BACK TO MY POINT. SO THAT FORTY TWO HUNDRED MILLION THAT'S PRETTY MINOR. AND IT'S NOW. TAKEN UP VERY MUCH BY. OUR RISING COSTS OF OUR CORRECTIONS SYSTEM SO WHAT THE LA -- GAVE ME. IS THAT. USING FIGURES FROM SEPTEMBER TWENTY SIXTEEN ABOUT 80%. OF INDIVIDUALS IN OUR STATE PRISONS HAD AT LEAST ONE ENHANCEMENT. AND THAT ESTIMATE WAS THAT. ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND OF CALIFORNIA'S PRISON POPULATION. HOW IS? IT HOUSING ENHANCEMENT COULD BE FIVE YEARS COULD BE TEN YEARS. AND THEY ESTIMATED. THAT THIS ULTIMATELY WOULD COST US BILLIONS OF DOLLARS SPREAD OVER YES A NUMBER OF YEARS BUT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. SO I THINK THAT IT IS. PRUDENT FOR US TO LOOK AT HOW MUCH DOES HAVE SERVED US FROM A PUBLIC SAFETY POINT OF VIEW. AND I ASK THAT BECAUSE PUBLIC SAFETY IS THE LEGITIMATE LANDS FOR US TO LOOK THROUGH. CRIME IS DOWN AND HAS BEEN DOWN FOR OVER TEN YEARS VIOLENT CRIME ESPECIALLY YOUTH CRIME. AND I THINK IT IS WISE FOR US TO LOOK AT WHEN WE ARE DEBATE WHETHER WE HAVE ADEQUATE FUNDS FOR EXAMPLE FOR TEACHER SALARIES FOR EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION OF OUR ZERO TO FOUR YEAR OLDS. OR FOR EXPANDING OUR HIGHER EDUCATION SHOULD WE BE INSTEAD CONTINUING. SENTENCE ENHANCEMENTS ON CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF CRIMES THAT ARE NOT REALLY SERVING US AND YET COSTING US AS ELLIE -- HAS ESTIMATED BILLIONS SO I ASKED FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THE USER SKINNER MEMBERS ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE SENATOR CROW. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT -- QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR. SIR WE DO WE TAKE A QUESTION YES PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU M. MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO IN YOUR BILL ONLINE -- PAGE TWO ITEMS -- LINE SIXTEEN IT SAYS AN ADDITIONAL TERM SHALL NOT BE IMPOSED. UNDER THIS SUBDIVISION. OF FOR THE CONVICTION OR PURPOSE OF THIS SECTION VIOLENT FELONY AND I'M SKIPPING DOWN TO TWENTY NINE BECAUSE EVERYTHING ELSE IS AMENDED OUT. SHALL MEAN THE FOLLOWING MURDER VOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER MAY HIM RATE AS DEFINED IN PARAGRAPH SUBDIVISION SECTION TWENTY SIX PARAGRAPH. ONE FOUR AND I'M ASSUMING IT'S A PARTICULAR RAPE. SODOMY AS DEFINED IN SUBDIVISION CD OF SECTION TWO EIGHTY SIX OR COPULATION LEWD AND LASCIVIOUS ACTS. ANY FELONY PUNISHABLE BY DEATH OR IMPRISONMENT AND ANY FELONY WHICH DEFENDANT IT FLICKS GREAT BODILY INJURY. ARMED ROBBERY ARSON VIOLATION -- IN VIOLATION OF A SUBDIVISION AB OR SECTION FOR FIFTY ONE SEXUAL PENETRATION AS DEFINED IN SUBDIVISION A OR J. ATTEMPTED MURDER VIOLATION OF SECTION EIGHTEENS AND 451-871-5187. FIFTY FIVE KIDNAPPING ASSAULT WITH INTENT TO COMMIT A SPECIFIED FELONY IN VIOLATION OF SECTION. TWO TWENTY CONTINUOUS SEXUAL ABUSE OF A CHILD IN VIOLATION OF SECTION TWO EIGHTY EIGHT POINT FIVE CAR JACKING. REAP SPELL SO RAPE SEXUAL PENETRATION IN CONCERT WITH A VIOLATION OF SECTION TWO SIXTY FOUR POINT. ONE EXTORTION IS DEFINED IN SECTION FIVE EIGHTEEN WHICH COULD CONSTITUTE A FELONY. AND IT GOES ON AND ON AND ON ARE THESE THE PARTICULAR ITEMS IDENTIFIED IN YOUR BILL THAT WILL NOT INCUR AN ADDITIONAL ONE YEAR ENHANCEMENT FOR PREVIOUS. CONVICTIONS. SORRY GO AHEAD SENATOR WIENER THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT -- THANK YOU AFTER I QUESTION MY COLLEAGUE FROM BAKERSFIELD. I COULD SIT HERE AND READ IT WOULD TAKE A VERY LONG TIME SO I DON'T WANT. TO SPEND THAT AMOUNT OF TIME BUT I COULDN'T READ -- OFF THE ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY OTHER ENHANCEMENTS BETTER MUCH HARSHER. THAN THE ONE YOU'RE ENHANCEMENT FOR EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THE CRIMES -- THEY USE HAS LISTED OFF AND IN FACT FOR SERIOUS AND VIOLENT FELONIES AND THOSE ARE ALL FAR AS I KNOW SERIOUS VIOLENT FELONIES. THERE IS A FIVE YEAR ENHANCEMENT AND YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO A COURT CANNOT IMPOSE BOTH THE FIVE YEAR. AND THE ONE YEAR AND SO IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY FOR PEOPLE WHO COMMIT SERIOUS AND VIOLENT FELONIES. YOU'RE GOING TO GO WITH A FIVE YEAR AND THEN YOU'RE NOT EVEN ALLOWED TO APPLY THE ONE YEAR IN ADDITION SOME OF THE CRIMES THAT YOU MENTIONED -- FOR EXAMPLE CHILD ABUSE KIND OF CRIMES ARE COVERED BY YEAH AND ADDITIONAL ENHANCEMENTS SPECIFIC THE CHILD ABUSE THEIR ENHANCEMENTS SPECIFIC TO THE MASTER BONDS SPECIFIC TO KIDNAPPING SPECIFIC TO HUMAN TRAFFICKING. AND THEN THERE ARE OF COURSE STRIKES BECAUSE YOU CAN GET AN ENHANCEMENT AND IT CAN QUALIFY AS A STRIKE AND HAD YOU TOWARDS LIFE IN PRISON -- SO THESE SERIOUS AND VIOLENT CRIMES ARE COVERED BY OTHER HARSHER LONGER SENTENCING ENHANCEMENTS -- THIS IS NOT THE ENHANCEMENT DIE IS GOING TO BE APPLIED TO THOSE KINDS OF CRIMES. THANK YOU ON MY OWN TIME MADAM PRESIDENT IS RECEIVED I'M JUST ARE I JUST WAS READING THE BILL TO FIND OUT OF BECAUSE YOU KNOW REALISTICALLY IF SOMEBODY'S GOING TO GET A FIVE YEAR PRISON ENHANCEMENT AND ADDITIONAL YEAR. WOULD BE -- I DON'T KNOW I WAS CONSIDERING YOUR BILL IS WHAT I WAS DOING AND THEN I READ ALL THIS INFORMATION ON HERE BECAUSE IT'S JUST A VERY SHORT FOUR PAGE BILLER FIVE PAGE BILL. BUT THE WAY IT READS IS THAT YOUR ELIMINATING AN ADDITIONAL ONE YEAR ENHANCEMENT FOR PREVIOUS CONVICTIONS OF ALL OF THESE IDENTIFIED VIOLENT FELONIES. N. SO I MEAN IN MY MIND OF SOMEBODY RAPES REGARDLESS OF THE DIVISION OR THE THE DESCRIPTION WHICH IS DEFINED OR COMMIT SODOMY ALL OF THESE LEWD AND LASCIVIOUS ACTS -- ARSON KIDNAPPING. AGAIN SPELL SO RAPE -- ALL OF THOSE THINGS IF THEY REPEAT THIS ACT I DON'T CARE IF THEY GET A TWENTY YEAR ENHANCEMENT. THEY SHOULD SERVE A PRISON TIME AND ANY ADDITIONAL ENHANCEMENT THAT A JUDGE COULD PROVIDE WOULD BE BENEFICIAL TO THE PUBLIC SAFETY IN SOCIETY SO I WOULD REQUEST A NO VOTE. THANK YOU SIR BATES MEMBERS FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE SENATOR PAM. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT -- I ACTUALLY -- SHARED TO MY GOOD COLLEAGUE FROM -- BAKER FEELS CONCERN BUT I ALSO HAD A ACTUALLY CONVERSATION ONLY WITH THE AUTHOR BUT HAD MY STAFF LOOK INTO THE ISSUE AND I THINK AS HE'S EXPLAINED -- BECAUSE MY CONCERN WAS THAT SOMEONE COMMITTED A VIOLENT FELONY ANSWERS FELONY AND THEY'VE COME IN OTHER ONE THAT. PERHAPS THERE SHOULD BE AT THE JUDGE'S DISCRETION AN ENHANCEMENT. AND IN FACT I THINK IS SEIZE CLEARLY STATED BOTH YOUR ON THE FLOOR AND CERTAINLY -- WE SEEN ALSO IN MY STAFF'S OWN EXAMINATION THAT ACTUALLY THERE ARE OTHER -- SHE MORE SEVERE ENHANCEMENTS AND IN FACT THIS PARTICULAR HAND SMIT CANNOT BE EMPLOYED. IF THOSE OTHER ENHANCEMENTS ARE USED SO I THINK -- FOR THAT REASON. I BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL WHAT DOES NOT ALLOW CRIMINALS WHO -- GAUGING SERIOUS VIOLENT FELONIES TO ACTUALLY GET A NECESSARILY A LESSER SENTENCE TO AND THEREFORE I SUPPORT THIS LEGISLATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER PANCER BRADFORD. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF ONE THREE SIX AND I THINK HISTORY HAS SHOWN US OVER THE LAST FORTY YEARS THAT. SENTENCE ENHANCEMENTS ARE TOUGH ON CRIME MEASURES HAVE NOT SUCCEEDED AT ALL ALL WE'VE DONE IS OVER POPULATE OUR PRISONS AND COST AGAIN THE TAXPAYERS MORE MONEY. BUT I AM IN TOTAL AGREEMENT WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM TO HIM WHEN HE SAYS THIS IS ABOUT JUSTICE. BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY IT'S JUST US BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE WHO ARE RECEIVING ATTACHMENTS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR I VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER BRADFORD MEMBERS FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. SEEING AND HEARING MANSER WINNER YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM PRESIDENT ARE COLORS FIRST OF ALL ON THE ISSUE THAT WAS RAISED -- AND THE SECTION THE BILL THAT WAS READ BY THE SENATOR FROM BAKERSFIELD -- LOOKING BACK AT THE BILL THOSE ARE ALL -- THOSE ALL PERTAIN TO THE THREE YEAR SENTENCE ENHANCEMENT THAT IS NOT BEING REPEALED SO THE THE SECTION ISSUE HERE IS BOTH THE ONE YEAR. AND A THREE YEAR -- AND WE'RE NOT REPEALING THE THREE YEAR ONLY REPEALING -- THE ONE YEAR -- SO JUST TO TO CLARIFY THAT THE LIST OF REALLY -- HEINOUS CRIMES IS NOT WHAT'S AT ISSUE HERE THE THREE YEAR AND HANDSOME WILL STILL BE IN EFFECT. AS WILL THE FIVE YEAR ENHANCEMENT AND THE MANY OTHER THREE FOUR FIVE SEVEN TEN TWENTY YEAR ENHANCEMENTS IN ALL OF THE STRIKES. AND ALL OF THE WAYS THAT WE HAVE OF INCARCERATING PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA -- THIS IS ABOUT TAKING ONE PARTICULAR ENHANCEMENT. ONE YEAR WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE DEADLY AND MOST SERIOUS AND HEINOUS CRIMES HERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LOW LEVEL OFFENSES. WHERE PEOPLE ARE BEING OVER INCARCERATED NOT SAYS HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR BEHAVIOR BUT OVER INCARCERATED HAVING THEIR LIVES DESTROYED HAVING THEIR COMMUNITIES? TORN APART UNDERMINING CALIFORNIA'S ABILITY TO PAY FOR THINGS LIKE HEALTH CARE AND HIGHER EDUCATION WE NEED TO STOP WITH THE MASS INCARCERATION AND THIS ENHANCEMENT IS PART OF THE PROBLEM AND NEEDS TO BE REPEALED I ASKED FOR AN AIBO.

SENATE BILL TWO THIRTY BY SENATOR CAFIERO ANAK WILLING TO LAW ENFORCEMENT. CENTER CABALLERO. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND COLLEAGUES I RATE RISE TODAY TO PRESENT SB. TWO THIRTY A BILL DESIGNED TO REDUCE THE USE OF FORCE BY POLICE OFFICERS. THAT WILL CHANGE THE CULTURE IN THE WORKPLACE OF OVER FIVE HUNDRED LINE FORSMAN AGENCIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WHEN I FIRST INTRODUCED THIS BILL IN FEBRUARY PEOPLE ASK ME WHY WOULD YOU BE INTERESTED IN THE BILL THAT IT THAT IS SO CONTROVERSIAL? WELL TELL YOU. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. I SERVED AS A CITY COUNCIL MEMBER FOR FIFTEEN YEARS EIGHT AS MAYOR. AND AS MAYOR AND COUNCIL MEMBER I TO VERY SERIOUSLY AND PERSONALLY THE RESPONSIBILITY TO CREATE PEACE. SAFETY AND HARMONY AMONG ALL RESIDENTS OF THE COMMUNITY NO MATTER WHO YOU ARE WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE. HOW YOU DRESS OR WHAT KIND OF WORK YOU DID? THE ISSUE OF WHEN THE USE OF FORCE BY POLICE OFFICERS AS APPROPRIATE AND WENT. UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES WAS VERY PERSONAL TO ME. AND IT IS EMOTIONAL COMPLEX AND DIVISIVE. WE MUST COME TOGETHER AND FOCUS ON THE TRUE INTENT OF THIS BILL. WHICH IS TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF USE OF FORCE INCIDENTS. CALIFORNIANS NEED TO STAND TOGETHER AND LEAD THE WAY FORWARD TO PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES AND OUR OFFICERS AS THEY UPHOLD THEIR COMMITMENT TO SERVE. THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS THAT WE KNOW THAT POLICE AGENCIES AND THEIR OFFICERS HAVE TO DO A BETTER JOB. OFFICERS AND THEIR SUPERVISORS NEED TO DO EVERYTHING IN THEIR POWER TO MINIMIZE THE USE OF FORCE USED. AND THOSE OFFICERS THE CONTINUE TO USE UNNECESSARY FORCE SHOULD BE GONE FROM POLICING. WE HAVE RESEARCH AND SURVEYED THE MOST EFFECTIVE METHODS PROVEN TO REDUCE THE USE OF FORCE. SB THIRTY TO THIRTY IS AN EVIDENCE BASED APPROACH THAT FOCUSES N ADOPTING NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED BEST PRACTICES WITH PROVEN RESULTS. THE BILL WILL RAISE THE NATIONAL STANDARD TO PROTECT THE SANCTITY OF LIFE BY REQUIRING THAT THE USE OF FORCE BE PROPORTIONAL TO THE THREAT IMPOSED. THAT IT ESTABLISHED THE FIRST STATEWIDE GUIDELINES TO CLEARLY DEFINED WHEN OFFICERS ARE AUTHORIZED TO USE FORCE. REQUIRE THAT EVERY CALIFORNIA LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER RECEIVED THE MOST RIVER ROBUST TRAINING IN THE NATION STRICTLY DESIGNED TO MINIMIZE THE USE OF FORCE. SET SPECIFIC POLICY REQUIREMENTS ON DE ESCALATION INTERPERSONAL COMMUNICATION TRAINING A TACTICAL METHODS THAT USED TIME DISTANCE COVER AND CONCEALMENT. REQUIRE IMPLICIT AND EXPLICIT BIAS AND CULTURAL COMPETENCY TRAININGS. ESTABLISHING A DETAILED STANDARDIZED REQUIREMENTS FOR REPORTING ALL INSTANCES WHEN FORCES USED SPECIAL SPECIFY THE USE OF FORCE POLICIES AND TRADING ARE CONSIDERED IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. AND ADDING NEW DUTIES SUCH AS A DUTY TO RENDER MEDICAL AID THE DUTY OF OFFICERS TO INTERCEDE AND REPORT INCIDENTS OF EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE. AND THE DUTY OF SUPERVISORS TO REPORT AND INVESTIGATE INCIDENTS. ALL OF THESE NEW GUIDELINES AND DUTIES WILL REQUIRE THAT THE FIVE HUNDRED POLICE AGENCIES AND THEIR OFFICERS UNDERGO A NEW TRAINING AND EDUCATION PROGRAM. THROUGH POST OR THE POLICE OFFICER STANDARD TRAINING PROGRAM. SB TWO THIRTY MAKES FUNDAMENTAL FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES TO HOW LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS ARE TRAINED AND THIS WILL AND ENABLE THE CULTURE SHIFT AWAY FROM USING FORCE TO GET COMPLIANCE. I ALSO WANT TO THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEBER FOR HER WORK TO DO DEDICATION AND COMMITMENT -- TO AB. THREE NINETY TWO AND AND HER COMMITMENT TO CHANGE TO MAKE CHANGE FOR THE BETTER FOR THE BETTERMENT OF OUR COMMUNITIES. AND ALSO FOR WORKING AND TALKING WITH ME ABOUT THIS BILL. THIS BILL FOCUSES ON SOLUTION TO CREATE MEANINGFUL CHANGE AND RECEIVED NO NO VOTE IN PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY. THANK YOU CENTER CABALLERO DISCUSSION AND DEBATE SENATOR NIELSEN. WELL PRESENT LADIES IN GENERAL THE SENATE THIS IS BEEN. A RATHER CONTROVERSIAL COURSE OF ADVANCE. THE EVOLUTION OF THE BILL'S. THREE NINETY TWO AND I WANT TO THANK. THE SENATOR FROM THE COAST FOR AUTHORING THIS. I SAY A MORE USEFUL VERSION. ONE THAT WOULD BE MUCH MORE RESPECTFUL OF THE LIVES OF OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT PROFESSIONALS IN LIVES IT WOULD AFFECT MEETING THEIR FAMILIES. I'D LIKE TO THANK THE ASSEMBLY AUTHOR TO OF THE BILL THAT I'VE OPPOSED. THAT THERE IS APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN. A WILLINGNESS TO NEGOTIATE. SOMETHING THAT IS. MUCH BETTER SENSE IN TERMS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. IF YOU HAVE NOT WALKED THE LINE. OR BEEN CLOSE TO IT YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THESE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE. WERE BY FORCE IS USED. S. FORCES BEING CONFRONTED. BY THAT OFFICER. YOU'RE NOT AWARE OF BY THE EVENING NEWS CLIP FROM SOMEBODY'S PHONE. OF WHAT HAPPENED PRECEDING THAT PARTICULAR MOMENT OF THE CLIP. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY. YOU DO NOT KNOW. WHAT GOES THROUGH THE MINDS OF THE INDIVIDUALS [inaudible] THE QUESTION [inaudible] THE PERPETRATOR. THEN THE LAW ENFORCEMENT PROFESSION [inaudible] THIS BILL. GOES A LONG WAY TO ACCOMPLISHING. THE CONCERNS I THINK OF MANY. WHO ADVOCATED SO VIGOROUSLY FOR A STRONGER BILL THE STRONGER BILL. WOULD HAVE WEAKENED. THE SAFETY. OF OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT PROFESSIONALS. THEN I CLEARLY ARGUE FOR THE CITIZENS. WHEN AN INCIDENT OCCURS WITH A GUN. IN A PERPETRATOR STARTS TO PULL THE TRIGGER. OFTENTIMES THEY DON'T QUIT. WITH THE FIRST FULL [inaudible] THEY CONTINUE. AND BYSTANDERS ARE OFTTIMES AFFECTED [inaudible] THAT HAPPENS [inaudible] EVERY YEAR. THIS CONTROVERSIAL IN THIS. AGONIZING IS THIS BILL HAS BEEN SO FAR. IT IS MY HOPE THAT WE REACHED A MOMENT OF CON FOR MICE AND I COMPLEMENT ALSO THE LEADERSHIP FOR BEING INVOLVED IN THIS. AND I'M HOPING THAT THIS OCCASION. IN THE LEGISLATURE AS WE WOULD BE VOTING. WE CAN HAVE TRUST. THAT THE DEAL THAT IS HERE WROUGHT. IT'S GOING TO STAY IN PLACE. THE NOT BE CHANGED LATER IN THE YEAR. BY SOMEONE ARGUING THAT CHANGE OF CIRCUMSTANCE. I'M PUTTING MY TRUST IN MY COLLEAGUES IN THIS INSTITUTION. WELL ABOVE MY VOTE YES. FOR THIS BILL. THANK YOU SENATOR NIELSEN CENTER ARCHULETA. ADAM PRESIDENT I'M SO PROUD HONOR TO BE A CO AUTHOR IN THIS BILL. TWO THIRTY IT IS. SOMETHING THAT WE'RE ALL EXCITED ABOUT BECAUSE BOTH HOUSES OF COME TOGETHER. IN AYE I THANK THE AUTHOR FOR THE TIME AND EFFORT THAT SHE PUT TOGETHER WITH HER COLLEAGUES -- FROM THE ASSEMBLY. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY THE FACT THAT WE CAN ALL RECOGNIZE THAT WHEN WE COME TOGETHER. FOR THE BETTERMENT OF THE COMMUNITY BETTERMENT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND THE BETTERMENT OF ALL OF US WHO SERVE THIS GREAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THAT WE CAN SHOW THAT WE CAN COME TOGETHER TO RE REALIZE THAT THERE ARE THINGS THAT HAVE TO BE CORRECTED AND I THINK THERE'S NO -- NO ONE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT TO REALIZE IS MORE THAN ALL OF US THAT WE HAD TO MAKE SOME ADJUSTMENTS. AND I THINK THE EDUCATION AND THE TRAINING ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE EQUAL NOT ONE NOT ONE DIFFERENT IN IN LA COUNTY ORANGE COUNTY SEVER DEAL COUNTY. OR UP IN SAN FRANCISCO. IT SHOULD ALL BE EQUAL THE TRADING SHOULD BE THE SAME ACROSS THE BOARD. TO TRAIN AND TEACH OUR MEN AND WOMEN IN LAW ENFORCEMENT WE TEACH WE TREAT PEOPLE WITH DIGNITY WITH PRIDE WITH RESPECT. AND WE MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE IS AFFORDED THAT OPPORTUNITY. THAT THE COURTS ARE THERE FOR A REASON AS LAW ENFORCEMENT IS THERE FOR A REASON AS WELL. SO I THINK THIS NOT ONLY COMES IN PUBLIC SAFETY BUT OFFICER SAFETY AS WELL. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY GOD KNOWS HOW MANY LIVES YOU WILL SAVE. AND I JUROR -- I VOTE THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU CENTER ARE TO LET US SENATE SENATOR MITCHELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM PRESIDENT AS I STOOD IN PUBLIC SAFETY AFTER WE WERE ABLE TO PROVIDE SOME CLARITY IN TERMS OF THE LANGUAGE THAT WAS PROPOSED IT WAS PROPOSED. LAST MINUTE IN PUBLIC SAFETY SO IT TOOK A FEW MINUTES TO FULLY UNDERSTAND THE SCOPE. ON THE NATURE OF THE CHANGES I WAS SPOKE THEN. ALL AND SUPPORTED AND CONTINUE TO SUPPORT SO DID TUESDAY TO DO SO TODAY -- I AM GLAD THAT WE WERE ABLE TO GET TO A POINT. ALL THAT THE TWO BILLS COULD BE COULD JOINED AND WE CAN HAVE A FULLER CONVERSATION ABOUT THE TRUE ISSUE IMPACT THE LONG COURSE MEANT. AND RESIDENTS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I THINK IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT WE CONTINUE TO HEAR WORDS SPOKEN ON THIS FLOOR THAT CONTINUES TO DENY. THAT WE HAVE A FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM. IN OUR COMMUNITIES ACROSS THIS STATE. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE MADAM PRESIDENT ALL LIFE. IS VALUABLE. THOSE WHO WEAR BLUE. AND THOSE WHO ARE BLACK AND BROWN EQUALLY. THE NOTION OF TRUST. THE NOTION OF TRUST IS IS REALLY A TWO WAY STREET. AND SO I'M CASTING MY VOTE TODAY BECAUSE I DO FUNDAMENTALLY BELIEVE THAT TRAINING IS NECESSARY TO CREATE CULTURE SHIFT. THE TRAINING IS NECESSARY TO CREATE A CULTURAL COMPETENCY AMONG THOSE. WHO TAKEN -- TO PROTECT AND SERVE ALL OF US. TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE REALLY IS AN UNDERSTANDING ABOUT HOW THEY ARE PERCEIVED BY CERTAIN SEGMENTS OF THE POPULATION. AND THAT WE CAN GET TO A PLACE WHERE ALL COMMUNITIES FEEL EQUALLY PROTECTED AND SERVED BY THOSE WE ENTRUST WITH THAT DUTY AND RESPONSIBILITY. AND SO YES I LOOK FORWARD TO VOTING FOR SB. TWO THIRTY I LOOK FORWARD TO THE OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE ON BEHALF OF ITS COMPANION BILL ON THE SENATE FLOOR ONCE AGAIN. AND HOPE THAT WE CAN ALL AS HAVE THE OPPONENTS AND PROPONENTS OF THESE TWO BILLS. CHANGE OUR OWN THOUGHTS AND MINDS AND LANGUAGE AS WE TALK ABOUT APPROPRIATE POLICING FOR THE FUTURE OF CALIFORNIA. I STAND IN SUPPORT OF SB. TWO THIRTY THANK YOU SENATOR MITCHELL CENTER HERTZBERG.
