I THANK YOU FOR YOUR CALL COOPERATION IN ADVANCE- I'LL BEGIN BY JUST SOME FEW OPEN REMARKS I ASKED ANY OF MY COLLEAGUES WHO WANT TO. SAY A FEW WORDS AS WELL. THE ABOUT OVER THE LOGISTICS NOW I WANT TO WELCOME OUR WITNESSES AND THANK THEM FOR COMING BEFORE THE SELECT COMMITTEE TO PROVIDE US WITH PERSPECTIVES. ON FINANCING OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES IN BUILDING CALIFORNIA'S BETTER SUPPLY CHAIN. ALL THE SEED YOU'LL TURN RESOURCE AREA SATISFY OF GLOBAL LITHIUM DEMAND ACCORDING TO INDUSTRY EXPERTS. GOVERNING SOME ANNOUNCED THAT GASOLINE POWERED CARS WILL NEED TO BE PHASED OUT BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE IN THE MAJORITY OF AUTOMAKERS FROM HYUNDAI TO GM TO JAGUAR PLANNING ON GOING ELECTRIC BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. THIS OPPORTUNITY IS EVIDENT. FOR CALIFORNIA AND CALIFORNIA BEING ON A PATH. TO BEING BE GLOBAL EPICENTER OF A CLEAN AND COMPETITIVE BATTERY MANUFACTURING SUPPLY CHAIN. THE LINES WITH THE STATE'S GOALS. FOR A JUST TRANSITION IN OUR TRANSPORTATION AND- EVEN- WITH AN EMPHASIS ON OUR ENERGY SYSTEM WITH POTENTIAL INFLUX OF THOUSANDS OF JOBS. AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND PRIVATE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE INSURE. RESIDENTS BUSINESSES AROUND SALT C. FULLY BENEFIT FROM THESE ENORMOUS OPPORTUNITIES. AS WELL AS THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE RIGHT FINANCING WILL BE CRITICAL IN BUILDING SUCCESSFUL DID LEAVE HIM BATTERY MANUFACTURING SUPPLY CHAIN. RIGHT HERE IN OUR OWN BACKYARD. IN ADDITION FOR CALIFORNIA TO MEET THE GROWING DEMAND OF ELECTRIC VEHICLE AND GRID STORAGE MARKETS AND THAT NATIONAL SECURITY REQUIREMENTS. LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS WILL NEED TO WORK HAND IN HAND. WITH THAT THIS HEARING IS DESIGNED TO START LAYING THE FOUNDATION FOR A STRATEGIC. LET HIM ACTION PLAN WHICH COMMITTEE MEMBERS WILL OVERSEE THANK YOU AGAIN TO EVERYONE WHO IS HERE AND THOSE WILL BE PARTICIPATING VIRTUALLY. THIS TIME I'D LIKE TO OPEN IT UP TO ANY MEMBERS WOULD LIKE TO SAY- ANY ANY. WORDS OR COMMENTS. SURE WELL THANK YOU- CHAIR I AM QUITE HONORED AND PROUD TO BE A MEMBER OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE. EARLIER THIS YEAR IN THE CITY OF MORE ON WHICH IS WHERE I GREW UP IT'S A BORAX MINING TOWN. LOCATED IN MY DISTRICT- REAL GENTLE WHICH USED TO BE U. S. BORAX. HAS ALREADY BEGAN PRODUCTION OF BATTERY GRADE LITHIUM. LITHIUM IS EXTRACTED FROM WASTE ROCK- THE WASTE WATER PRODUCT FROM NINETY YEARS OF MINING OF OPERATION AT THIS PARTICULAR SITE IN MY HOMETOWN. THE PLANT IS CURRENTLY OPERATING AT FIVE METRIC TONS A YEAR. WHICH IS ENOUGH TO PRODUCE BATTERIES FOR APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY THOUSAND ELECTRIC VEHICLES. HOWEVER THIS PLANT HAS THE CAPACITY TO DOUBLE THAT PRODUCTION DETAINMENT METRIC TONS OF BATTERY GRADE LITHIUM A YEAR. WHICH WOULD POWER A HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND ELECTRIC VEHICLES. I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS PLANT IN BORON IS PRODUCING LITHIUM ENTIRELY FROM WASTE MATERIAL WHICH MEANS NO FURTHER MINING AS NECESSARY. THIS IS ESPECIALLY CRITICAL OF THIS GREAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE NATION AND THE REST OF THE WORLD IS SERIOUS ABOUT CARBON REDUCTION. MY DISTRICT IS ALREADY TAKEN THE INITIATIVE TO EXPLORE THIS VALUABLE RESOURCE TO HELP. SUPPLY THE GROWING DEMAND FOR LITHIUM BATTERIES AND I'D LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIR IN THE SPEAKER FOR POINTING ME TO THE SELECT COMMITTEE AND I LOOK FORWARD TO BEING A CONTRIBUTOR TO THIS NEW GREEN ECONOMY. THANK YOU SIR. THANK YOU OF CARE GARCIA FOR THIS I'M HONORED TO BE ON THE COMMITTEE AS WAS SPOKEN EARLIER I DO HAVE A LIFT YOUR MIND ON THE FAR EASTERN EDGES OF MY DISTRICT AND SHOSHONE VALLEY JUST BEFORE YOU CROSS OVER NEVADA LOOK FORWARD TO ALL OF US WORKING TOGETHER TO BRING THEM ALL TOGETHER FOR LITHIUM. TO BE BATTERIES BUT THEN I'LL BRING IT UP LATER ON IS ONE CONCERN IS WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO WITH THE BATTERIES AND FIVE YEARS AFTER THEY WERE MADE TO BE RECYCLED OR IN THE WAY SO I LOOK FORWARD TO THE DISCUSSION AND GO FOR THE SPEAKERS ARE GOING TO GO FORWARD. AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THEY YOU BUT TO BE FOR A PARTICIPATING TODAY'S HEARING THE FIRST A PANEL WILL BE. MADE UP OF COMMISSIONER FROM THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION THAT'S KAREN DOUGLAS YOU'LL- GIVE US A BIT OF A SOME CONTEXT IN TERMS OF- PRIOR HEARING. AND HOW IT FITS INTO TODAY'S DISCUSSION SO FAR KAREN. A COMMISSIONER KAREN DOUGLAS IS WITH US I THINK SHE'S GOT ABOUT FIVE MINUTES TO GIVE A PRESENTATION AND SHE- ALL. I'M THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M HERE I REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY IN THE INVITATION TO SPEAK HERE TODAY AND TO HELP SET THE STAGE FOR THIS DISCUSSION TODAY- MY COMMENTS ARE GOING TO FOCUS ON THE US ALL SEE AREA BUT I DID WANT TO MENTION I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY WITH THE CHAIR OF THE COMMISSION TO VISIT THE MINDED AND MORE ON WHERE OF MINE TAILINGS ARE BEING PROCESS TO EXTRACT LITHIUM AND IT'S ANOTHER EXCITING EXAMPLE OF CALIFORNIA'S. LITHIUM OF POTENTIAL AS AS WE CONSIDER THE LITHIUM ECONOMY EACH YEAR IN CALIFORNIA- SO WHAT I'M GOING TO FOCUS ON IS THE OPPORTUNITY TO RECOVER LITHIUM FROM GEOTHERMAL BRINES AT THE SALTON SEA AND HOW THAT DIFFERS FROM SOME OF THE MORE TRADITIONAL WAYS OF PRODUCING LITHIUM SO ON. MY WAY OF CONTEXT OF COURSE CALIFORNIA'S A NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LEADER IN OUR RENEWABLE ENERGY CLIMATE AND CLIMATE GOALS THAT MAKES US A LEADER AND WE VERY MUCH ARE A LEADER IN DEPLOYING LITHIUM BASED TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS- ELECTRIC VEHICLES THAT USE LITHIUM ION BATTERIES AS WELL AS- LITHIUM BASED BATTERIES THAT HELP SUPPORT OUR ELECTRIC GRID DURING CRITICAL THAT PEAK HOURS- WERE ALSO AT THE ENERGY COMMISSION WE HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF HELPING SUPPORT- BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION A LITHIUM EXTRACTION IN CALIFORNIA AND- THAT'S BEEN. A GREAT EFFORT TO- ASSESS OPPORTUNITIES AND REALLY EVALUATE OPPORTUNITIES- FOR WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF THE SALT SEA REGION AS WELL AS SUPPORTING COMMUNITY DIALOGUE AND ENGAGEMENT- GLOBAL TRENDS ARE VERY MUCH IN THE DIRECTION OF RAPID DEPLOYMENT OF CLEAN ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES THAT REQUIRE LITHIUM BUT REALLY MASSIVE SCALES AND THIS. POSITIONS CALIFORNIA AND- SOME SEE READ. TO BE LEADER IN A CALL SUPPLY CHAIN- THAT CAN. I AM VERY INCLUDED FIRST COMPONENT OF HOW. LITHIUM AND ALSO RELATED INDUSTRIES THAT TAKE ADVANTAGE URBAN USE THAT UTILIZE THE LITHIUM AND THE CLEAN ENERGY THAT WE HAVE IN ABUNDANCE IN THE STATE. SO- THE DEAL THERMAL BRIAN'S ON THAT ARE ABOUT A HALF MILE BENEATH THE SALTON SEA HAVE PROBABLY WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT CERTAINLY CURRENTLY BELIEVED TO BE THE HIGHEST CONCENTRATION OF LITHIUM CONTAINEDIN GEOTHERMAL BRINES ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. AND RECOVERING LITHIUM FROM THOSE BRIAN'S IS FUNDAMENTALLY A VERY COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PROCESS DONE THE WAY LITHIUM IS CURRENTLY- MIND SO WELL THE TWO WAYS A LITHIUM IS CURRENTLY EXTRACTED RIGHT NOW. INCLUDE HARD ROCK MINING AND THAT FOLLOWS THE TRADITIONAL MINING PROCESS WHERE HEAVY EQUIPMENT IS USED TO REMOVE SOIL FIND LIST AND FIND WITHIN RICH DEPOSITS WITHIN HARD ROCK- THOSE DEPOSITS ARE EXTRACTED AND THEN THERE'S A CHEMICAL. PROCESSING THAT'S DONE TO GET THE LITHIUM OUT OF THOSE HARD ROCK DEPOSITS ON THE MINING IS ENVIRONMENTALLY- IMPACTFUL OBVIOUSLY IN THAT IT CAN SCAR A LANDSCAPES AND ADVERSELY AFFECT ECOSYSTEMS AND HABITAT. IT'S ALSO WATER AND ENERGY INTENSIVE. IN CONTRAST TO THE PROCESS AND THE OPPORTUNITY AT THE SALTON SEA WHERE LITHIUM RECOVERY CAN LITERALLY BE ANY COPRODUCT OF CLEAN ENERGY PRODUCTION- THE HARD ROCK ALL RIGHT SO THE OTHER MAJOR OUR METHOD FOR PRODUCING LITHIUM TODAY. IS THE OF THE OPERATIVE BRIAN PROCESSES USED X. EXTENSIVELY IN PARTS OF SOUTH AMERICA AND THIS PROCESS INVOLVES PUMPING HIM BRIAN. UNDERGROUND SURFACE POOLS MIXING INTERLOCAL THAT HELP SEPARATE OUT THE NON LITHIUM CONSTITUENTS LETTING THEM STAY FOR A PERIOD OF TIME THAT CAN EXTEND FROM MONTHS TO YEARS. TO EVAPORATE AND- TAKING EXPOSED WITH. THE M. FOR FURTHER PROCESSING SO. THIS PROCESS IS IN- IT'S YOU KNOW VERY OFTEN WATER INTENSIVE IN A DESERT REGIONS SO IT IT'S GOT SIGNIFICANT ECOLOGICAL AND HUMAN IMPACTS IN MANY PLACES WHERE- WHERE THIS TECHNOLOGY IS WIDESPREAD. AND IT CAN REQUIRE- THOUSANDS OF SQUARE MILES OF LAND. SO IN CONTRAST TO THESE TWO TECHNOLOGIES DIRECTOR LITHIUM RECOVERY ALLOWS FOR A VERY VERY SUSTAINABLE LITHIUM SUPPLY. IT'S THE PROCESS OF REMOVING LITHIUM FROM GEOTHERMAL BRINE. ARE TYPICALLY USING AN ENGINEERED MATERIAL SURFACES THAT THE LITHIUM ION IN THE BRINE IS ATTRACTED TO AND STICKS TO SO BASICALLY THE GEOTHERMAL BRINE IS BROADER FOR WELLS IT'S USED TO GENERATE ELECTRICITY THE VERY HOT BRINE IS USED TO GENERATE ELECTRICITY GEOTHERMAL PLANTS. AND THEN IT WOULD BE FURTHER PROCESS TO- GET THE LITHIUM OUT OF THE BRIAN THERE ARE ACTUALLY A COUPLE DIFFERENT WAYS THAT CAN BE DONE ON IT AND THAT FELT BETTER BEING DEMONSTRATED IN THE SALT SEA AREA. AFTER THE LITHIUM IS RECOVERED THE SPENT BRIAN IS SENT BACK TO THE GEOTHERMAL FACILITIES INJECTION WELL AND IS RE INJECTED INTO THE RESERVOIR AGAIN THE HALF MILE OR SO DEEP. IN THE SALTON SEA AREA DIRECT WITH HIM RECOVERY IS USUALLY PERFORMED ON SITE OR VERY NEAR THE GEOTHERMAL FACILITY. IT IT CAN BE AN OUT ON PROCESS TO EXISTING GEOTHERMAL PLANTS SO THE GEOTHERMAL PLANTS THAT ARE THERE TODAY CAN BE MODIFIED. TO ADD THIS PROCESS. AND ON A CAN ALSO. BE ARE A PROCESS THAT'S INTEGRATED INTO ANY NEW GEOTHERMAL PLANTS BUILT IN THE FUTURE. OF COURSE ARE AS WE MOVE FORWARD TO MEET OUR CLIMATE GOALS IN CALIFORNIA AND MAINTAIN A RELIABLE ENERGY SYSTEM WE'RE REALLY SEEING THE VALUE OF THE CLEAN FOR POWER THAT GEOTHERMAL PROVIDES AND IN A RECENT- PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION DECISION THEY CALL FOR- A THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF CLEAN FIRM POWER WHICH I DO THERMAL POWER IS ON THE SB ONE HUNDRED WORK DONE BY THE JOINT AGENCIES ALSO DEMONSTRATES OUR SIGNALS. THERE IS A LONG TERM VALUE TO THIS CLAIM FROM POWER SO- YOU KNOW THE ENERGY COMMISSION HAS PROVIDED SUBSTANTIAL FUNDING SUPPORT OVER SIXTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IN IN GRANTS- TO ADVANCE- DEMONSTRATIONS AND RESEARCH IN THE AREA OF LITHIUM RECOVERY- PARTICULARLY CONSULTANC BRIAN'S AND- WE'RE ALSO HELPING SUPPORT. S. INNOVATIONS LITHIUM COMPILED MANY. REDUCE AND RECYCLING- I THINK THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT TOPIC AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY AND TO THIS OFTEN AND APART ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU COMMISSIONER- I'M GOING TO ASK THAT WE HOLD OFF ON QUESTIONS STILL LOOM- THE END OF THE- PRESENTERS OR PRESENTATIONS- WE WANT TO- GO INTO THE NEXT PANEL BUT WE DEFINITELY WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE. D. WORDS THAT YOU MENTION AS IT RELATES TO OTHER READ HIM OPPORTUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE DAY. WITH ONE OF OUR COLLEAGUES HERE IS CERTAINLY AN AREA THAT WE WANT TO ALSO DIVE INTO AND TAKE A LOOK AT- THE APPROACH THAT'S BEING TAKEN THERE- THAT IS CLEANER GREENER. AND PRESENTED UNIQUE ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY- FOR THE STATE SO- WILL HOLD OFF ON SOME QUESTIONS WILL GO INTO OUR NEXT PRESENTER AND I HOPE THAT YOU CAN- STAY WITH US SO THAT- WE CAN ENGAGE YOU AS WE GET READY TO ASK QUESTIONS. OUR NEXT PRESENTER WE HAVE UP TO FOLKS WHO WILL BE FOCUSED ON FINANCING- LANDSCAPE OF- THIS DISCUSSION DR RAMISH RAMA MOORTHY CHAIR PROFESSOR IN MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING. AT UC BERKELEY AND IS AN APPOINTEE- TO THE BYRON HARRIS TRANSITION AGENCY. TO REVIEW TEAM REVIEW TEAM I'M SORRY FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY- THEY'LL BE ON THE SCREEN SHORTLY- AND THEN- FOLLOWED BY- STEVEN BOYD PROGRAM MANAGER- VEHICLE TECHNOLOGIES OFFICE BATTERIES ELECTRIFICATION FOR DEPARTMENT. OF ENERGY AS WELL BOTH WILL BE SPEAKING FOR ABOUT FIVE MINUTES EACH SO- DEFIED DR IF YOU'RE READY. U. S. SO YEAH THANK YOU- GARCIA THANK YOU SOME MEMBERS BUT TO SEE. WELL AS A QUICK INTRODUCTION. I WAS A SOME SHOT DIRECTLY WHICH WAS. PUT TOGETHER TO LOOK AT THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES OF A LIFETIME. IN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION AND SOMETIMES TALK TO BE A VERY SUCCESSFUL DEAL WE PROGRAM BECAUSE WE HELPED. BRING THE COST OF SOLAR ELECTRICITY DON ACQUIT PARODY. I THOUGHT SAME TIME THIS IS BACK IN AT THE SAME TIME I ALSO WAS THE LEAD PI IN THE CRITICAL MATERIALS HUB WHICH I'M GOING TO GET TO IN A SECOND- DOC WAS THE CRADLE TO GRAVE PROGRAMS ON ASKING. THE QUESTION HOW DOES ONE. WHAT TO OPTIMIZE BE. AND LOOKING INTO IS ONE OF THE ONE I'M GONNA ABOUT TODAY BUT OTHER MINERALS WELL LIKE ROADS BOARD TO TALK ALL OF THE- THERE WAS INCREASE CONCERN ABOUT BEING HELD HOSTAGE BY. NAY LAST TO THIS YEAR I SORT OF THE- PROPELLING BECAUSE BIDEN- TRANSITION TEAM WHETHER. OF AND- I HAD TWO OR THREE OLD SON ONE OF THE AB SPECIFIC. TO DO WITH- WHAT WE CALLED XBOX THE CHARGE MORE THAN VERSIONS OF THE SO CHART THE YOU POST FOR THE SUN WAS TO TAKE THE POWER OF THE NEW. THE FEDERAL DOES STATE GOT THE PRIVATE SECTOR UNIVERSITIES NATIONAL LABS BRING THEM TOGETHER TO SOLVE THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS SUPPORT LIFETIME. AND WE DON'T FIVE TORN PAPERS FLOW CHARTS FOR THE BLIND AND HARRISON. CROSSCUT FOR ALL OF THEM WAS KNOWS OF CRITICAL. COULD MEN. IN THEIR- ALL OF THESE ARE TRUCKS CLEARLY THE FIRST ONE OF THEM IS ENERGIES. STEVEN WILL TALK THAT A SMALL- THAT'S ALREADY OUT ON THE OPENED UP IN THE OPEN. DEPARTMENT OF G. NOW ALL OF LOOKING FOR IDEAS ON ON HOW. TO PROGRESS THAT. NOW BACK IN TWO. AND SOME SHORT WAS STILL IN THE EARLY STAGES- IT WAS VERY CLEAR THAT THIS IS GOING TO WORK- I WAS PUSHING STEVEN CHOI DID WE SHOULD BECOME MORE AGGRESSIVE IN TERMS OF THE METRICS THAT WE WERE USING. IT WAS ALSO A- THE ONE THING THAT COULD LOOK AT SOLAR OR WIND FOR THAT MATTER. IS THE FACT THAT WE DON'T HAVE LOW COST- RIDGE IN THOSE DAYS BATTERIES WERE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS A KILOWATT HOUR. AN HOUR CALCULATIONS WERE TELLING US THAT WE NEEDED TO GET TO ABOUT THIRTY DOLLARS A CAN OF. COURSE NOW WITH TESLA'S BOB THE PRODUCT WE NOW HAVE THE POSSIBILITY OF GETTING TO ONE HUNDRED TWENTY DOLLARS A KILOWATT HOUR BUT WE NEEDED TO GET THE THIRTY DOLLARS HELLO. SO IT WAS VERY CLEAR THE REVENUE. ARE TO BE STRONG GET. BY THE AVAILABILITY OF LOOK. STORAGE MAYBE A WAYS OF STORING BUT CLEARLY AT MINE BATTERY WERE. THE MOST ATTRACT SO YOU FOR THIS. NOT COMING TO LOOK AT MY BATTERIES I SHOULD SAY THAT AT MY BROTHERS WERE INVENTED CAL. ACTUALLY L. B. BACK IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES PROFESSOR COMBINED WAS OF THE EARLY PIE. IN THIS FIELD SO IN CALIFORNIA WE DO HAVE THE UNIVERSITIES ALL THE UC IS WE DO WILL- THE NATIONAL LABS. LAWRENCE BERKELEY LAB WHICH ALL AGREE DEEPLY ENGAGED IN I SHOULD SAY THAT THEY'LL B. L. WHICH IS WHERE I'M ALSO. EMPLOYED THE BILL HAS A VERY COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM ON THE P. MIND BATTERIES AND STEVEN WERE TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT IT IF YOU ALL NEED TO SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES AND CAN COME IN AND GIVE YOU A- BIGGER REFUND. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS VERY GOOD I REMEMBER DOING THAT PLEASE THREE BRIEFS SELECTED TO GO ON A- ALL ON THE NEEDS CRITICAL TOWARDS AN HOUR FOR WAS TO. ON LOOKING BECAUSE MONEY THAT THE- ELECTRIC OF. IS GOING TO BE DEPENDENT ON THE AVAILABILITY OF LITHIUM AND IF YOU LOOK AT ALL THE NUMBERS TO- DARK THAT DOES GOING TO BE A HUGE GOOD OLD THE BABY FROM ABOUT FORTY BILLION. DOLLAR MARKET. IN TWENTY TEN. TO ABOUT HOW FIFTY DOLLAR MARKET AND OF THE OTHER THING THAT WE- REALLY- PUSHING VERY HARD WITHIN OUR TRANSITION TEAM WHY STILL AT PUBLIC PRIVATE. UNTIL WE GET SOME. ABOVE FORTY BAHT ENTITY AGENCY. ALSO MAYBE TWENTY BILLION GOES INTO OUR AND B. AND- THAT'S WHAT WE WERE FOR A- WITH THE STATE. AND HE TOLD US HAVE THEIR OWN RE. TO HAVE NATURAL RESOURCES FISCAL RESOURCES PEOPLE RESOURCES SO ON AND SO FORTH AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR COMES IN AS THE OTHER. PART OF THE PUZZLE SO WHAT WE WERE PUSHING FOR. INTENSELY IN OUR TRANSITION TEAM WANTS TO HAVE A PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP WHERE WE CAN COME TOGETHER BRING THE NATION TOGETHER TO SOLVE THE BIGGEST PROBLEM SUPPORT LIFETIME. AND WALKED WHAT A BIGGER PROBLEM THAN ENERGY OR CLIMATE CHANGE- THE REAL ENERGY STORAGE IS PERHAPS THE FINAL FRONTIER. I'M SORT OF SAYING THAT WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT WAYS BY WHICH YOU KNOW THE STATE GOVERNMENTS OF THE STATE OF. THE CORPORATE OF ENERGY. I WILL LEAVE YOU WITH JUST ONE PART AND I'M VERY HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS AND STEVEN WILL ELABORATE MORE FROM THE- SITE. WHAT WE NEED TO BE THINKING ABOUT IS INVENTED IN CALIFORNIA OR THE UNITED STATES FOR THAT MATTER. MADE IN CALIFORNIA ARE MADE IN THE US AND THEN SOARED WORD WHITE BOX WHAT WE SHOULD BE A SPOTTING. ON THE SIZE OF THESE MARKETS IS NO MORE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IT'S TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS UNTIL WE HAVE A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY TO CAPTURE THIS THANK YOU VERY MUCH- GERMAN GARCIA HAVE DECREASED SINCE THANK YOU DR- WILL LOOK GET RIGHT INTO THE NEXT PRESENTER AND WE'LL- RESERVE. SOME TIME FOR SOME QUESTIONS FOR YOURSELF AND THE OTHER PRESENTERS ONCE WE COMPLETE THE AT THE PANEL. PRESENTATIONS THANK YOU STEVEN BOYD PROGRAM MANAGER. VEHICLE TECHNOLOGIES OFFICE- BATTERIES ELECTRIFICATION FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY IF YOU'RE READY TO GO YOU'VE. GOT- FIVE MINUTES THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT AND THANK YOU FOR MUCH FOR THE INTERACTION AS WELL- IT'S GOOD TO TALK TO YOU ALL TO. I'LL TRY TO MAKE IT- BUCKS OF THE AT BUTTON. POINTS HERE. THE OTHER OF WHICH IS TO- I WORK IN THE TECH. OFFICE THE OF ENERGY. WHERE PRIMARILY A ARE AND D. ORGANISE. WE'VE BEEN MORE OUT FOR A LONG TIME- IN. AND A STORAGE FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES. AND WE'RE REALLY SEEING THE- ENJOYING THE SUCCESS- THAT ARE INDIA'S HAD OVER THE YEARS AND- CURRENTLY VERY EXCITEDABOUT THE DIRECTION THAT ELECTRIC VEHICLES. AND BATTERIES AND ENERGY STORAGE YOU'RE TAKING. I'M REALLY THAT IS OUR FOCUS IS. IS BEGINNING TO LOWER COST BATTERIES TO ENABLE- GREATER GREATER SHARE OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES- BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT WE HAVE- SOME SIGNIFICANT PARTICIPATION- NOW IN SOME OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN EFFORTS THAT COULD SUPPORT- ELECTRIC VEHICLES AT THE ELECTRIC VEHICLE SORT OF AT SCALE. IN THE MARKETS THIS IS NOT THE HUNDREDS OF. THOUSANDS OF VEHICLES WE SEE TODAY. IT'S A VEHICLES K. TO HAVE SOMEBODY MISSED GO- AND ADDING CALIFORNIA'S WELL TO SEE. PORTION OF THE MARKET. AND SO ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT- THAT SUPPORTING THAT I THINK IT'S BEEN MENTIONED IS THE PRESIDENT'S EXECUTIVE ORDER FOURTEEN OF SEVEN ON AMERICA SUPPLY CHAINS. I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT OF THE FOUR AREAS THAT ARE MENTIONED THERE HIGH CAPACITY BATTERIES ARE ONE OF THOSE WHICH VERY MUCH FALLS WITHIN THE REALM OF- OF LITHIUM. LITHIUM BASED BATTERIES. THIS IS LOOK ACROSS THE SUPPLY CHAIN UPSTREAM- IN TERMS OF RAW MATERIALS MIDSTREAM PROCESSING CELL MANUFACTURING AND DOWNSTREAM- FOR PACK MANUFACTURING TO- APPLICATIONS INCLUDING ELECTRIC VEHICLES. ALSO IT'S- THERE A REPORT THAT- ARE OFF- CONTRIBUTE TO THEM VERY SIGNIFICANT WAY AND OTHERS I THINK SOME IMPORTANT CONTENT THAT'S WORTHWHILE MENTIONING IN THAT SECTION. THIS REPORT DOES HIGHLIGHT A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT- IMPORTANT AREAS AND THOSE INCLUDE VULNERABILITY ACROSS THE SORT OF UP IN MID STREAM AND DOWNSTREAM- PARTS OF THE BATTERY SUPPLY CHAIN- THIS INCLUDES A LITHIUM. AS A AS A PRIMARY SUPPLY CHAIN PORTABILITY AND THAT THE US HAS A SIGNIFICANT DEFICIT IN MINERAL- REFINING AND PROCESSING OF LITHIUM AS WELL AS IN THE MID STREAM THAT WE HAVE THE US HAS LESS THAN 2% OF GLOBAL MARKET SHARE FOR CAPACITY ACROSS ALL MAJOR BATTERY COMPONENTS INCLUDING SELF DEPRECATION. MOST OF THESE ARE ALL CRITICAL AREAS IN WHICH- WE ARE FOCUSING AS WELL AS DOWNSTREAM FOR BATTERIES WHERE THE US CURRENTLY LAGS OTHER MARKETS IN TERMS OF LITHIUM BATTERY RECYCLING WITH LESS THAN 5% OF LITHIUM ION BATTERIES RECYCLED EACH YEAR. I ALSO. WANNA HIGHLIGHT THAT- IN THIS REPORT- THERE'S A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT GOALS ARE PROBABLY HIGHLIGHTED INCLUDING STIMULATING DEMAND FOR BATTERIES SO CREATING DEMAND BY ELECTRIFYING FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL PURCHASES OF VEHICLES AND BUSES. AS WELL AS POINT OF SALE REBATES STRENGTHENING KEY BATTERY MATERIALS SUPPLIES SUCH AS- MEALS ACIDIC STRATEGIES WITH IMPROVED ENVIRONMENTAL LABOR STANDARDS AS WELL AS ESTBLISHING COMPREHENSIVE RECYCLING POP POLICY TO DRASTICALLY INCREASE BATTERY CAPTURE MATERIALS RECOVERY. PROMOTING DOMESTIC BATTERY MATERIALS CELL AND PACK PRODUCTION. SO DOES INCENTIVIZING PRIVATE INVESTMENT THROUGH FEDERAL GRANTS TAX CREDITS FEDERAL LOANS AND LEVERAGING EXISTING PROGRAMS SUCH AS OURS. AND AS WELL AS INVESTING IN THE PEOPLE AND INNOVATIONS THAT ARE GOING TO SUPPORT THIS MARKET SERVICES ADDITIONAL ARE INDEED TO MEET UP FOREMAN'S AND COST TARGETS SUCH AS- THAT WORK OUR OFFICERS. AS. WELL AS- DEVELOPING THE WORK FORCE- I ALSO HIGHLY AS AN AS A PART OF MY REMARKS TODAY. THAT WE- KEENLY FOLLOWING THE INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT AND JOBS ACT. WHICH IS AGAIN CONTINUING TO DEVELOP- ON BOTH A CURRENT LEAD WHERE- FOCUSED ON A FEW DIFFERENT SECTIONS OF THAT BILL INCLUDING THAT BATTERY MATERIAL PROCESSING GRANTS- THIS IS FOR- UPSTREAM AND MIDSTREAM LITHIUM BASED BATTERY SUPPLY CHAIN WORK. THAT CURRENTLY- CALLS FOR THREE BILLION DOLLARS OVER FIVE YEARS INVESTMENT FOR THAT AREA. AS WELL AS MIDSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM BATTERY MANUFACTURING AND RECYCLING WORTH WORK ANOTHER THREE BILLION THERE. AS WELL AS DOWNSTREAM- THAT FOR LITHIUM BATTERY RECYCLING THERE ARE A FEW DIFFERENT AREAS INCLUDING- CONTINUING ON OUR LITHIUM BATTERY RECYCLING PRIZE THAT DEALS WITH THE- THE SORTING. STORAGE AND PROCESSING FOR CURRENT LITHIUM ION BATTERIES IN THE MARKET AS WELL AS BATTERING CRITICAL MINERAL RECYCLING AND BATTERY RECYCLING RESEARCH DEVELOPMENT FOR RESEARCH AND DEMONSTRATION GRANTS THAT'S A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION. AND FINALLY TWO HUNDRED MILLION FOR ELECTRIC DRIVE VEHICLE BATTERY RECYCLING AND SECOND LIFE APPLICATIONS THAT'S USING THE BATTERIES A DIFFERENT APPLICATION OTHER THAN THE ORIGINAL VEHICLE. AT THEIR END OF LIFE. FINALLY OUR TO MENTION THAT YOU ALSO- PART OF OUR OFFICE- YOU USE A WHOLE IT DOES ON ON PRO OFTEN- THAT LOW PROGRAMS OFFICE HAS- THIS. REACHED OUT- TO- CRITICAL MATERIALS- COMMUNITY AND- IN AREAS SUCH AS LITHIUM SPECIFICALLY FOR BATTERIES SO THERE'S A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT MATERIALS THAT THEY FOCUSED ON OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE AVAILABLE AS PART OF THAT LOAN PROGRAM- FOR THIS SORT OF A CAPITAL EXPENSE. OKAY I'LL I'LL IN THERE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU STEVE BOYD WE'RE GOING TO GET A PERSPECTIVE FROM. LOCAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT- FOLKS- THE NEXT SPEAKER PANEL THREE WILL BE A TIM KELLY PRESIDENCY OVER PROBABLY ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION. HE'LL BE TALKING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE LOCAL AND STATE- LANDSCAPE ON FINANCING- MISS KELLY. GET THE BOUT FIVE MINUTES PLEASE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SOME MEMBER GARCIA. A GOOD MORNING. CALLING IN FROM- NASH WHERE I JUST A- INCLUDED IN A- YOU CAN DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL ANNUAL CONFERENCE. IN WHICH I THERE'S A LOT OF DISCUSSION ELECTRONIC VEHICLES ENERGY WORKFORCE AND INFRASTRUCTURE. AND THESE ARE ALL MAJOR TOPICS THAT ARE GOING TO DISCUSS TODAY AND THINGS ARE GOING AFFECT THIS OF THIS INDUSTRY. I WANT TO MAKE PHRASES YOU'RE GOING HERE TODAY IS CLEAN LETS HIM. AND I THINK WE NEED TO FOCUS ON THAT. BECAUSE 75% OF OUR BATTERIES IN THE WORLD ARE PRODUCED IN CHINA AND POWERED BY COAL POWER PLANTS. AND USE LITHIUM. AND OTHER MINERALS PRODUCED IN COUNTRIES WITH DEVASTATING ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS. CALIFORNIA'S LEADER IN OUR INDIAN CONSUMPTION OF BATTERY OPERATED VEHICLES AND EQUIPMENT. WE CANNOT MAKE THE MISTAKE AGAIN OF REGULATED BUSINESSES AND PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA THE BENEFITS OTHER STATES AND COUNTRIES. WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF AN ENTIRE SUPPLY CHAIN FROM THE LIQUID MINING TO THE LITHIUM PURIFICATION PROCESSING DISTRIBUTION. AND LIFECYCLE RECYCLING. THE GIRL COUNTY IS TAKING MANY STEPS. TO POSITION OURSELVES FOR SUCH AN OPPORTUNITY. WE ARE THE LEADERS OF PRODUCTION OF GEOTHERMAL AND SOLAR ENERGY AS WELL AS WIND AND TRANSPORTATION FUELS. LITHIUM EXTRACTION PURIFICATION AND PROCESSES REQUIRES A LOT OF ENERGY WATER AND LAND AND WORKFORCE AND OF COURSE THE MINERAL. ALL THESE ARE AVAILABLE IN THE IMPERIAL COUNTY. STEPS THAT WE'VE TAKEN OVER THE DECADES PARTISAN POSITION TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS INDUSTRY CLUSTER ARE AS FOLLOWS. IN WILL COUNTY WAS GIVEN PERMISSION TO PERMIT POWER PLANTS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL YOU LOOK BELOW FIFTY MEGAWATTS SINCE THEN WE HAVE. BUILT ABOUT FIFTEEN YOUR THERMAL PLANTS ALL OF THEM FORTY NINE POINT NINE MEGAWATTS. WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THAT INCREASED TWO HUNDRED MEGAWATTS TODAY TURBANS COULD BE. A BUILT THE CONVERGENCE NINETY FIVE MEGAWATTS WITHTHE ECONOMIST GAIL IN THE ENERGY THAT'S NEEDED FOR THIS INDUSTRY THAT'S THE DIRECTION THAT WE NEED TO GO. INTEL COUNTING DEVELOP TO GEOTHERMAL OVER LATE WHICH EXPEDITES THE PERMITTING FOR GEOTHERMAL PLANTS. WE CAN PERMITTED YOUR THERMAL PLANT IN ABOUT EIGHTEEN MONTHS IN THE CALL COUNTY THAT'S ABOUT THE BARE MINIMUM. WE GOT A LOT OF EXPERIENCE DOING THAT AND WE THINK THAT- WITHOUT OVERLAYING AND WITH THE INCREASE. OF AND THE MEGAWATTS THAT WE CAN PERMIT LOCALLY WOULD CREATE A BONE TO THIS INDUSTRY. WE ALSO DEVELOPED A RENEWABLE ENERGY OVERLAY WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF THE- PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION WHICH IDENTIFIES IDEAL LOCATIONS FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY. WITH THE LEAST INTERRUPTION TO THE VALUABLE AGRICULTURAL LAND AND THE ENVIRONMENT. THAT IS CORRECT THE PLACE. WE'VE DEVELOPED LARGE SPECIFIC PLANNED AREAS CONTINUE FACTORING THE GATEWAY TO THE AMERICAS HIS THREE THOUSAND ACRES LOCATED ON THE MEXICAN BORDER THAT THE SPORT OF ENTRY DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY FOR INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND ASSEMBLY. KEYSTONE PLANNING AREA IS FIVE THOUSAND ACRES. NO SPECIFIC PLAN AREA AND THREE THOUSAND ACRES THE GENERAL PLANNED AREA ONCE AGAIN IN A LOCATION THAT'S GOING HAVE LEAST INTERRUPTION TO AGRICULTURE AND DESIGNED FOR MEDIUM AND HEAVY MANUFACTURING. VERY INTERESTING IN THE DEVELOPING A THIRD SPECIFIC PLAN AREA NEAR THE SALTON SEA LAUNCH IT FROM A RESOURCE AREA. THIS IS WHERE THE BRIDE WILL BE PRODUCED. WE'LL BE PRODUCING THE ENERGY AND WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXTRACT AND PURIFY IN ONE LOCATION NOT TO MENTION THE ULTRA TRACKED THE MANUFACTURING. SO WHAT IS HOLDING US BACK. YOUR PROVIDER KELLY. HOWEVER THE DISTRICT IN THE SOLVENCY BUDGETS ARE MORE RESOURCE AREA AS IS THE CURRENT SHARE OF THE LOOKING VALLEY COMMISSION AND HAS BEEN HOLDING MANY FORCING FOCUS GROUPS ON THE FOLLOWING TOP BOX FIRST OF ALL INFRASTRUCTURE CONSULTANCY BECAUSE YOU'RE A LACKS MAJOR INFRASTRUCTURE. WE'VE IDENTIFIED THE ROADS. THE BRIDGES. BROADBAND RAIL WALL. ALL THE ROADS LEADING TO THAT AREA ARE MAINLY DIRT ROADS AND THE BRIDGES ALL NEED TO BE REPLACED OR REPAIRED. IN AN AREA THAT HAS BILLIONS OF DOLLARS INVESTING IN GEOTHERMAL THERE IS NO BROADBAND AND SO THAT'S A MAJOR NEED FOR US TO BRING BROADBAND INTO THAT AREA AND WE'RE WORKING ON THAT. PERMITTING AS I MENTIONED WE NEED TO INCREASE OUR CAPABILITIES OF LOCAL PERMITTING. AND REQUESTING FUNDING FOR COUNTY TO BE ABLE TO DO ADDITIONAL STUDIES. TO SPEED UP THE PROCESS OF OUR MEETING IN OUR COUNTY. PACIFIC LIFE FOR THE PURIFICATION MANUFACTURING WE'VE ALREADY DONE A GREAT JOB WITH THE GYM THERMAL. AND RENEWABLE ENERGY OVERNIGHT. OUR WORK FORCE WE CURRENTLY HAVE SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY PUBLIC COLLEGE. AND EVEN STUDIES UNIVERSITY IN INDUSTRY AND LOOKING AT HOW THEY COULD PROVIDE THE WORKFORCE FOR THE FUTURE NEEDS. I AM PROUD COUNTY WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD IS WORKING ON WAYS TO FINANCE AND TRAIN EMPLOYEES FROM THE YOUTH TO POSTGRADUATE. IMPERIAL COUNTY ENTIRE COUNTY IS A FOREIGN TRADE ZONE. WHICH MEANS THAT WE CAN NOT ONLY IMPORT BUT WE CAN ALSO EXPORT GOODS INTO FOREIGN TRADE ZONES AND OTHERS FOR VERY LOW COST. ALSO TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE U. S. MCA IN DOING THAT. AND WHEN IT COMES TO RECYCLING OUR ENTIRE COUNTY IS ALSO A RECYCLE MATERIAL DEVELOPMENTS ON. A PROGRAM THAT HAS SOME LIMITATIONS BUT I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THAT COULD BE WORKED ON AS AN EXAMPLE THERE'S A CAP ON FUNDING FOR TEN MILLION DOLLARS. MOST THE PROJECT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE ARE IN EXCESS OF ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED TWO BILLION DOLLARS AND IMPERIAL COUNTY IS A LOT OF THE LOCATION WHEN WE TALK ABOUT I WOULD WORK TO RECYCLE THOSE MATERIALS AND TURN THEM INTO OTHER OTHER THINGS. ASSISTING OUR SMALL BUSINESSES WORKING WITH THE SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT CENTER. AND THE C. M. D. C. TO DEVELOP PROGRAMS AND HELP EXISTING BUSINESSES AND NEW BUSINESSES TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE COMING OUR WAY. IMPERIAL COUNTY IS AN IDEAL PLACE TO CAPTURE THE ENTIRE SITE SUPPLY CHAIN- OF THIS INDUSTRY THAT IS BEFORE US BUT WE REALLY NEED TO STAY AHEAD OF THE CURVE. AND THE WAY THAT WE NEED TO DO THAT IS WITH SOME THINGS I JUST MENTIONED BE PREPARED AND WORKING ON ALL THESE THINGS AT THE SAME TIME TODAY. THANKS OUR ENERGY. IS GOING TO THEIR PERMITTING HAS RECEIVED PERMITS THEY ARE COMMITTED TO BUILDING A PILOT PROJECT. IN A COMMERCIAL PROJECT WILL BE SCALABLE FOR THE FUTURE. ENERGY SOURCE JUST RECEIVED THEIR PERMITS LAST WEEK. I FOR THEIR LITHIUM EXTRACTIONS WERE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT. CONTROLLED THERMAL RESOURCES NEW COMPANY IS LOOKING AT BUILDING. ITS FIRST PHASE NINETY FIVE MEGAWATT GEOTHERMAL PLANT WHICH WILL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE INNER CITY AND THE MINERALS THAT CAN BE EXTRACTED FOR THIS INDUSTRY. ALL THESE CUTS ALL THESE BUSINESSES AND THE OTHERS THAT WERE WORKING WITH. ARE VERY CAREFUL NOT TO OVER PROMISE AND UNDER DELIVER. A REALISTICALLY TWENTY TWENTY FOUR IS HE TARGET DATE THAT WE'RE LOOKING LOOKING AT IT SEEMS LIKE A LONG WAY OFF. BUT THAT'S WHAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE IN ORDER TO PERMIT. CONSTRUCT AND- FINANCE. INDUSTRIES FINANCING IS THE KEY HERE AND SO AS WE'VE BEEN MOVING ALONG WITH THESE COMPANIES FOR MANY YEARS IT'S PROVING A DE RISKING THE INDUSTRY SO THAT WE CAN ATTRACT THE FINANCING. ADDUCTION TAX CREDITS IS AN EXAMPLE OF A FEDERAL PROGRAM WHICH WAS DOES NOT BENEFIT GEOTHERMAL ENERGY. TAKES EIGHTEEN MONTHS TO BUILD A GEOTHERMAL PLANT PRODUCTION TAX CREDITS THE DION AFFECT TWELVE MONTHS AFTER YOU BREAK GROUND. THAT'S ONE EXAMPLE OF HOW A CERTAIN CERTAIN PROGRAMS DO NOT BENEFIT THIS INDUSTRY AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE THE CALIFORNIA WE COULD WORK ON THAT TOGETHER. WE'VE BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL BUT WITH THE DARK CAL COMPETES PROGRAM FOR THESE BUSINESSES AND IMPERIAL COUNTY- CHALLENGES THERE IS THAT- YOU HAVE TO HAVE EXTERNAL COMPETITION FROM OTHER STATES AN ORDINANCE THAT. AND SO THERE'S A FOCUS ON THE LITHIUM INDUSTRY THEN I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WOULD BENEFIT US LOCALLY- THE REASON FOR THAT IS. BECAUSE THIS GENTLEMAN ANOMALY IS ONLY INDIAN GIRL COUNTY. THERE'S NO PLACE IN IN THE UNITED STATES THAT HAS THIS RESOURCE AT THE VOLUME THAT WE HAVE. IN ADDITION TO THAT IT THIS INDUSTRY REQUIRES A LOT OF WATER AND A LOT OF ENERGY. OUR POTENTIAL FOR GEOTHERMAL ENERGY IN THE GIRL COUNTY IS PROBABLY ONLY ABOUT TWENTY PERCENT. AND SO WE HAVE A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY TO EXPAND THAT AS WE EXPAND THE JEWS THE GEOTHERMAL POWER PLANTS WERE ALSO SPENT EXPANDING. THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE EXTRACTION OF THE MIRROR OF THE MINERALS SO THEREFORE WILL BUILD PRODUCE THE POWER IN THE MINERALS AT THE SAME TIME. THESE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU LOOK AT. IF YOU THINK ABOUT AND- IN THIS OF. ARE THEY ARE CHALLENGE THEIR ON THE BACK AND THEN AND NOT ON THE FRONT END. AND MY OPINION IS THAT INCENTIVES DON'T MAKE ABOUT POP OBJECT GOOD TO MAKE A GOOD PROJECT GREAT. AND THAT'S WHERE WE NEED HELP WITH A COUPLE OF THESE PROGRAMS. WHAT'S THE NUMBER ONE CENTER WE CAN HAVE WORKFORCE. RIGHT IS THERE A WAY THAT WE CAN DEVELOP PROGRAMS THAT ARE THESE INDUSTRIES HIRE LOCAL PEOPLE AND TRAIN LOCAL PEOPLE. THAT THEY WILL RECEIVE THE FUNDING TO DO THAT THEN THAT WOULD BE. HUGE WE'RE LOOKING AT AN INDUSTRY THAT'S A GAME CHANGER FOR COUNTY COUNTY THAT HAS. A HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN THOUSAND PEOPLE. I WE HAVE- THE HIGHEST UNEMPLOYMENT. WE HAVE PEOPLE WORKING TOGETHER TO TRY TO TRY TO IMPROVE THE OPPORTUNITIES IN OUR COUNTY AND RETAIN OUR WORK FORCE. AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE COULD DO THAT. SO WITH BUT LOOKING AT THAT WE CAN'T MAKE THE MISTAKE THAT WE MADE WITH SOLAR. WHICH IS REQUIRED THAT WE HAVE SOLAR IN THE IN THE STATE OF. CALIFORNIA AND THAT WE DON'T CREATE THE OPPORTUNITIES INCENTIVES. TO BE ABLE TO. A PRODUCES ALL PLANTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THERE'S THINGS THAT THE WORK TO BE DONE TO MAKE US COMPETITIVE. AND TO ATTRACT INDUSTRIES. ANOTHER THING THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE PUSHING PUSHING FOR. IS TO CHANGE THE OPPORTUNITY ZONES. I WHICH IS A MECHANISM. THE OPPORTUNITY ZONES ARE NOT AVAILABLE IN THIS AREA- OF THE- SALTON SEA GEOTHERMAL RESOURCE THERE- AN ERROR IN THE- CONTRACT. OVER TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS INVESTMENT. AND SO AS I MENTIONED A LOT OF INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS. YOU CAN PLACE WORKFORCE TRAINING. OUR TRAINING IT'S- JUST IN BUSINESS- BUT WE HAVE THE RESOURCE WE HAVE THE DESIRE WE HAVE A COUNTY THAT SUPPORT THE GROWTH. AND THE OPPORTUNITIES WITH PUTTING A LOT OF THINGS AND PLACES I MENTIONED. MEETING ON A REGULAR BASIS. THAT WE ARE PREPARED IN WILL BE PREPARED FOR THE THINGS THAT WERE. LOOKING AT TO IDENTIFY WITH THE FUTURE NEEDS ARE. JOB HOPPING SAID I. WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY BIGGER. I WANT TO LET YOU KNOW THAT ON. A THE DISCUSSIONS I'VE HAD WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. AND THAT WERE WORKING ON THIS TOGETHER. AND THAT- AS- WE ARE TRYING TO COME UP WITH THAT THE SOLUTIONS THAT ARE GOING. NOT ONLY BENEFIT THIS INDUSTRY BUT A TRACKED OTHER MANUFACTURING. TO THE GIRL COUNTY. AND WE DO NEED HELP TO DO THAT- IT THAT'S WHY WE'RE TALKING TODAY AND WERE WILLING. TO LISTEN. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU PUBLIC FOR QUITE. THANK YOU MISTER. WE'RE GOING TO- HOLD OFF ON THE QUESTION WE WILL GO INTO THE NEXT- PRESENTING PANELIST DANIEL FITZ GERALD. THE ACTING REGIONAL FOR THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY SBDC NETWORK- FOLLOWED BY TOM SOTO COMMISSIONER. ON THE LYDIA VALLEY COMMISSION FOUNDING MANAGING PARTNER OF DIVERSE COMMUNITIES IMPACT FUND.

THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER IT'S GOOD TO BE HERE AND BE ABLE TO TALK ON THIS- AND I APPRECIATE THE INVITATION AND THE INVOLVEMENT THAT THE AT THE ASSEMBLY HASN'T AND ASKING THE SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT CENTER. A PROGRAM TO BE HERE. AS MR KELLY MENTIONED WE'RE WE'RE A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF THE SMALL BUSINESS ASPECT SO I RECEIVED ONE OF THE READ FIVE REGIONAL ETWORKS YOU'RE IN CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT CENTER WHICH IS EIGHT FIVE PROGRAM FUNDED BY THE US SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION. BUT ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY SUPPORTED BY THE CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF THE SMALL BUSINESS ADVOCATE AND TO THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. I THROUGH THAT IT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE EXPANSION PROGRAM IN THE CAPITAL INFUSION PROGRAM. SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT CENTERS WE HAVE A MISSION TO HELP BUSINESSES FROM IDEATION TO EXIT NOT THE WORST HIGHER LIFE CYCLE ONE OF THE MAIN COMPONENTS OF THAT IS TRUE FINANCING. WE WORK ON WITH BOTH GAS FINANCING AS WELL AS EQUITY FINANCING AND SOMETHING TO TALK A BIT ABOUT TODAY WHICH IS SOMETIMES CALLED TECHNICALLY NON DILUTIVE FINANCING WHICH IS SIMPLY TERMS ARCHITECT RANTS. BUDGET RESEARCH. GRANTS IN THE STORE. AND SO WHAT OF THE I WANTED. AS MR KELLY ABLE TO DO. SOME OF THAT LARGER. AROUND THERE'S- YOU KNOW BURKE HALF. CERTAINLY IS NOT A SMALL BUSINESS THERE'S A- OF. A BUSINESS ATTENTION OR NEW CHECK. THE AROUND WITH EXTRA. OR THE DEVELOP OF DIFFERENT OF THE YOUNG ALL THE WAY TO USED ABOUT RESPECT. AND ANOTHER WITH A WHOLE LOT. ENTREPRENEUR THAT IS GOING INTO INNOVATOR BASED THIS OR CHECK. BASED BUSINESS. YEAH. ARCHDUKE'S DAMAGE BUSINESS HOUSING DIFFERENT TACK NEEDS AND SO THEY NOT GOING TO BE NEEDING TO GET TYPE OF. TO AND IS THERE MORE COMMENTS HI TAX CREDIT WERE WERE THINGS LIKE THAT RATHER WHAT NEED SIMPLE TERMS CAPITAL AND THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE PREDOMINANTLY AFTER AND THEN THE OTHER COMPLY WHICH IS WHERE THE SMALL BUSINESS THE- CENTER COMES. WHICH IS THE TECHNICAL SYSTEM LET'S NAVIGATE TO GET TYPES OF THAT ARE OUT THERE IN WORKING WITH EITHER YOU KNOW HOW NAVIGATE COUNTY. RUN LIKE THIS AND TO BE ABLE TO FIND A TAX EVERY. SO OF THE MAIN ELEMENT FOR A- FOR. I WANTED TO BRING UP THAT YES NIECE WE DO OF FOR FIRST BUSINESS INNOVATION RESEARCH GRANTS ARE. COURT OUT THERE ARE DESIGNS. FOR COME. I THESE ARE OUR YOUR CALL. FOR DIFFERENT. AID EVERYTHING FROM. OUR VERY COMMON IN THIS DIEGO AREA FROM THE NOW INSTITUTE OF HEALTH NATIONAL. FOUNDATION AROUND LIKE SCIENCE. ALSO WATER AROUND THE PARKING OF DEFENSE MANY US FROM WITH NOW ARE YOU. IN THE GOT THAT'S A- OTHER PARTS OF THIS. YOU IS CALM AND PARTICULARLY IN THE CENTER VALLEY. AND USGA. OR WOULD GO SUPPORT USED. OR QUESTIONS AT. YEAH THERE'S ALSO DEPARTMENT ENERGY. THEY HAVE A VERY. AMOUNT OF I GRANT AND THINGS THAT. IS OF CALIFORNIA ALL. A BALLOT IN THIS. THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA. COMMISSION AND I KNOW THE I C. O. WITH TAX THE ECHO AND ONE OF OUR PART. YEAR IS PART OF S. B. C. NETWORK THAT AN ACCURATE DIEGO. AS DONE SOME OF WORK AROUND. DIFFERENT TYPES OF CLEANING AND TECH. YEAH WHEN I WAS OUT TO TALK WHAT ARE SOME OF THOSE. EIGHTY CALIBER COULD DO THIS TO EXPAND INSISTED THOSE OF PROGRAMS. THAT IS WHAT IS NOT. YOUR NEEDS AS THEY DEVELOP THESE TAX. ASTOR AT ME WAYS. BUT THE NEXT. WHAT USE LITHIUM WORKING AT DEMAND. TECHNIQUES ARE. BECAUSE THESE ARE ON. TECHNOLOGY WHICH MAY THERE IS AN PARTICULAR MARKET. RATS OR SOMETHING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SUPPORTED THEMSELVES. THAT ALLOWS THESE TECHNOLOGIES TO BE DEVELOPED IN THE FUNDO WHERE THEY HAD THAT ENTREPRENEURS ABLE TO FOCUS ON DEVELOPING THE TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPING THE MARKET PLACE FOR IMPROVING THAT MARKET PLACE. BECAUSE WHAT WILL HAPPEN IS AFTER THREE TO SAY NINE YEARS OF DEVELOPING THAT YOU'RE LOOKING TO SELL THAT. TO COMPANIES LIKE BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY. AND THAT'S REALLY THE LIFE CYCLE OF THAT PARTICULAR BUSINESS AND THAT'S WHERE THEY'RE GONNA BE LOOKING OUT HUESO WHAT'S THERE. SO HAVING THAT TYPE BONTA WHO GRANT BASED FINANCING I CAN'T WAIT SPECIFIC RATHER APPLYING S. B. I. R. HAS APPROVED ALL THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION IS DONE. SAMPLES YES THOSE TYPES OF CONTINUED FUNDING ARCO'S ARE THINGS THAT YOU ABSOLUTELY SUPPORT AND VERY VERY SOLID OPTIONS FOR FINANCING. THAT ALLOWS THOSE COMPANIES TO. OF COURSE YOU'RE ALSO WAS THE EQUITY COME. IN OUR TALK TO WHICH- ABOUT THAT ANOTHER. THAT'S WHERE ALL. WE COME PLAY AND- SPEAKING IN THE SUPPORT FOR THAT. IT CAN CAN. TO COMMENT AS WELL AS SUPPORT. YEAH IDEAS HOW WE HELP FOLKS BE ABLE TO SEEK OUT EACH OR PASTORS BE ABLE TO DEVELOP WHAT THEY NEED TO UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING THAT THE STRATEGIES THEY NEED TO PUT TOGETHER. MORE TO WORK WITH THE POTENTIAL FINANCIAL FASTER TO WORK WITH VENTURE FUNDS IN OTHER WORDS TO REALLY BE ABLE TO BUILD UP THAT FINANCING THEY NEED TO DEVELOP THEIR TECHNOLOGIES DEVELOP THEIR BUSINESS AND ALSO DETERMINE WHAT THOSE PARTICULAR MARKETS ARE. AND THOSE ARE CRITICAL SUPPORTS. BESIDES THAT THE STATE ALREADY HAS. EXCELLENT FINANCING TO WE WHICH I THINK THERE STUPID THINGS THAT COULD BE LOOKED AT. IT COULD POTENTIALLY FALL JUST. AS THE AS THE TECHNOLOGIES DEVELOPED. I I'VE BEEN ALREADY DOESN'T. JOB AND DOING SOME LOAN GUARANTEES THAT'S CLEARLY THE MOST SUCCESSFUL MODEL FOR THAT THAT'S TRUE TO FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT CORPORATIONS HERE IN THE CDA. REGIONAL F. CAL SOUTHERN THERE'S FIVE OTHER FTC'S THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND HE'S BASICALLY WORK JUST LIKE HOW THE SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION. GUARANTEED BOX OR MORAL AREAS HOW DO U. S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE GUARANTEES BOX. THANKS WHILE THESE TYPES OF LOANS BECAUSE THE STATE IS TAKING THE RISK AWAY FROM THE PARTICULAR LENDER. AND ALLOW THEM TO BE ABLE TO CHECK THAT PARTICULAR. ANSWER CONTINUING TO DEVELOP THOSE TYPES OF OPTIONS AND FINDING CREATIVE WAYS WHERE THESE LAUNCH OF THESE TYPES OF FINANCING CAN ALSO BE DEVELOPED. IT'S COULD BE CENTRAL TO THE FUTURE. CHANGELLY THERE MAY BE OPTIONS EVEN UNDER PROGRAM IS COMING OUT FROM U. S. TREASURY CALLED THE STATE SUPPLEMENTAL BUSINESS CREDIT INITIALLY. S. S. B. C. I. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WOULD HAVE TO OPTIONS AS WELL. OKAY I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO KIND OF TALK ABOUT THIS THIS IS AN EXCITING DEVELOPMENT TECHNOLOGY. YOU KNOW THERE'S NEW THIS CAN BE A NEW POCKET DEVELOPMENT DIFFERENT TYPES OF TECHNOLOGIES NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR ENTREPRENEURSHIP. AND CERTAINLY I THINK THERE THERE ARE CERTAIN CREATIVE WAYS THE PACKAGE SO I CAN APPRECIATE I. YEAH YOU KNOW I CAN UNDERSTAND QUESTIONS. HERE THANK YOU GET NERVOUS BECAUSE JOE WILL UP. GO INTO THE NEXT PRESENTER THAT'S UP. TOWN SO- THE COMMISSIONER ON THE. LET HIM VALLEY COMMISSIONS SORT OF. GARCIA MEMBERS OF THE CA THANK FOR. INVITING ME TO TESTIFY TODAY I THINK- THE INTENT OF MY- STATEMENT REALLY IS GOING TO BE FOCUSED AROUND. WHY SOMEONE LIKE MYSELF WHO'S A LONG TIME INVESTOR AND CLEAN TACK IT CLEAN NERGY- SEES THIS AS AN ATTACK ATTRACTIVE- SECTOR TO DEVELOP LEADERSHIP AND GOOD ECONOMICS- I DON'T THINK THAT THERE IS ANYTHING MORE FAVORABLE IN THE COUNTRY THEN WORKING WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BECAUSE WE HAVE. THE DIFFERENCE HERE IS THAT WE HAVE THE LEADERSHIP AND THE WILL TO EXECUTE THE STRATEGY AND COMBINE THAT WITH US BEING THE CRADLE OF INNOVATION THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY ON PLANET EARTH AND THE FACT THAT WE HAVE THE TO THE GENETICS OF BEING ABLE TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE. IT'S ALL THERE AND AS A REMEDIATION DANIEL AND EVERYBODY ELSE APPOINTED TO ALL OF THOSE FACTORS HELP TO DE RISK THE EQUITY THAT COME IN- THIS IS NO ACCIDENT THAT WE HAVE THE PROFOUND AMOUNT OF- EDUCATIONAL CAPACITY WHAT ARE YOU SEE IN CAL STATE AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM. THE WATER INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS AN INCREDIBLE RESOURCE NOT JUST TO US BUT WAS A BEACON FOR OTHER PLACES THE PLANET TO FOLLOW OUR HIGHWAY INFRASTRUCTURE- YOU KNOW WE ARE OUR OUR CAPACITY TO INNOVATE- COMES FOR MARK TIED HERE GAINES. IT WENT TO THE MANHATTAN PROJECT WHICH HELPED TO ESTABLISH SILICON VALLEY WHICH HELPED TO ESTABLISH THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY REVOLUTION WHICH HELPED TO ESTABLISH. THE FOURTH INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION. MY PURCHASE A IN THIS MARKET HAS MUCH MORE TO DO WITH LEADERSHIP AND ECONOMICS BECAUSE THE ECONOMICS FOLLOW. FROM THERE. WE HAVE THE WELL WE HAVE THE DESIRE AND WE HAVE THE MARKET. SO MY POINT IN CONTRIBUTED TO THIS DISCUSSION ES. WHAT IS IT THAT WE NEED IN THE INVESTMENT COMMUNITY IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS NOT A LOSS LEADER THAT THE ECONOMICS HERE. ARE NOT ONLY HAVE BEEN PROVED OUT BUT THERE IS GOING TO BE NEW TERRITORY. ALL OF THIS IS HAPPENING IN THE MIDST OF HUGE CRISIS THAT. PEOPLE CALL LIKE SIX STANGEL I JUST CALL IT A REAL CRISIS THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS THIS IS JUST A MORAL- TRAGEDY THAT WE'VE LET IT GET THIS FAR WITHOUT RESPONDING. AND AS BILL CLINTON USED TO SAY NEVER LET A GOOD CRISIS GO TO WASTE SO HERE WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF A HUGE JOB TURN WHERE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS HUGE RESERVES- THE ECONOMICS OF KOBE ED. ARE QUICKLY GETTING BEHIND US WERE CONCERNED ABOUT A LITTLE BIT OF INFLATION BUT IS WHAT IS IT THAT WE COULD DO TO INCENSED FOLKS LIKE MYSELF TO COME INTO THE VALLEY. AND BEGAN TO CONVERT. IMPERIAL VALLEY INTO WHERE IT SHOULD BE. WHERE WE ALL INTENDED TO BE AND THAT IS TO BE A BEACON. OF SOUND LONG TERM ECONOMIC SECOND HELP TO CONTRIBUTE TO IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR THE PEOPLE NOT JUST OF IMPERIAL VALLEY BUT OF THE UNITED STATES IN CALIFORNIA. IN PARTICULAR WE HAVE TREMENDOUS AMOUNTS OF RESOURCES HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT HAVE BEEN PROVED OUT THERE WOULD BE NO TESLA. WITHOUT A CARD. THERE WOULD BE NO INTEREST IN THE SECTOR WITHOUT EMISSION CREDITS. THE BOOKENDS OF ALL OF THESE. INNOVATIONS OCCUR NOT BECAUSE YOU HAVE GREAT ENTREPRENEURS BUT YOU HAVE A GREAT ENTREPRENEURS WHO HAVE CAPACITY TO GET THAT NON DILUTIVE LIKE DANIEL WAS TALKING ABOUT THAT GIVES ME OUTSIZED RETURNS ON THE BACK AND WHEN I GO TO THE SHAREHOLDERS WHO WERE THE SHAREHOLDERS WELL IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE HUGE PUBLIC EQUITY. HOLDERS WHITE CALPERS AND CAL STIRS WHOM WE SHOULD BE ENCOURAGING TO INVEST IN THIS AREA BECAUSE THERE IS GOING TO BE A HUGE MULTIPLE THERE AS WELL FOR THE PENSIONERS YOU KNOW BY THE WAY. 40% OF THOSE PENSIONERS AND DEFINED CONTRIBUTORS LOOK LIKE PEOPLE ON THIS SOON CALL. THEIR LOW INCOME THERE ARE HARD WORKING LABOR. UNION ORGANIZED WORKERS WHO ARE MOSTLY DIVERSE AND THEY SHOULD SERVE AND GET THE BENEFIT OF THE INVESTMENT IN THIS AREA SPECIFICALLY WE HAVE. THE CALIFORNIA POLLUTION CONTROL FINANCE AUTHORITY IN THE TREASURER'S OFFICE SECOND HELP TO UNDERWRITE AND PROVIDE NON DILUTIVE DEBT TO THESE TYPES OF PROJECTS- WE HAVE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF CAPACITY WITH. THE U. S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE THROUGH THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ADMINISTRATION WHICH IS NOW UNDER THE LEADERSHIP. OF OUT OF- ALEXANDER CASIO RECENTLY APPOINTED BY PRESIDENT BY- WE HAVE A HUGE AMOUNT OF WIND IN OUR SAILS BECAUSE THERE'S A NUMBER OF CALIFORNIA'S APPOINTED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY. I JUROR SHOPPER GENERATE CAPITALS NOW HEAD OF THE DEAL WE LOAN PROGRAM THAT'S FORTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN ITS OWN RIGHT KAREN SKELTON A SENIOR ADVISER TO SECRETARY GRANT. SECRETARY RANDOM ALTHOUGH FORMER GOVERNOR OF MICHIGAN I CONSIDER AN HONORARY CALIFORNIA SO I THINK THAT WE HAVE A HUGE AMOUNT OF CAPACITY THAT. WE CAN GET BEHIND THIS ADMINISTRATION AND NEWLY UP. SOON TO BE REELECTED SENATOR ALEX PADILLA TO HELP TO SUPPORT THESE INITIATIVES AS WELL. THAT IS THE TYPE OF DYNAMIC THAT FOLKS LIKE I LOOK FOR IN ORDER TO INVEST THE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT WILL BE NECESSARY TO DEVELOP WHAT WE KNOW IS THE FOURTH LARGEST RESERVE OF LITHIUM ON PLANET EARTH. AND IS CARRYING IT MENTIONED EARLIER IT IS A MORE SUSTAINABLY DEVELOP A BALL SOURCE OF LITHIUM THAN ANY PLACE ON EARTH AS WELL ALL AND BY THE WAY THE BEST WAY TO ACCESS IT IS THE INCREASED MORE RENEWABLE POWER. BY CREATING MORE GEO THERMAL ENERGY WHICH- BY THE WAY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA JUST PUT OUT A DEMAND BY THE PC FOR TWELVE THOUSAND MORE MEGAWATTS OF NET DISPATCHABLE RENEWABLE POWER. DISPATCHABLE IS SPINNING RESERVE TWENTY FOUR HOUR RENEWABLE POWER AND TO ME THAT SAYS GEOTHERMAL BIOMASS AND STORAGE SO THERE'S ANOTHER BOOK AND THAT HELPS TO CREATE THE ECONOMIC FLOOR THAT IS NECESSARY. FOR THE ATTRACTION OF CAPITAL AND EQUITY TO GET INTO THIS GAME. AND I'LL JUST CLOSES BY STATING THAT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BEING AN ELECTED OFFICIAL AND LEADERS. IS TAKING ACTION LIKE YOU ARE RIGHT NOW. WE WANT HAVE IT BE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION WITHOUT THE LEADERSHIP OF ASSEMBLYMEMBER GARCIA THE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE AND SPEAKER RAN DOWN FOR UNDERSTANDING THE NEED FOR FOCUSING RESOURCES ALL THIS RHETORIC AND ALL THIS ACTION. ENSUED ECONOMICS INTO THIS AREA SO QUITE FRANKLY BRING THIS AREA OUT OF POVERTY FOR GOD'S SAKE WE'RE THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD HOW IS IT THAT THIS IS NOT IMMORAL SO WE HAVE A MORAL BECAUSE- TO USE THE ECONOMICS OF THIS CRISIS. TO UP WITH THIS COMMUNITY. AND BRING THEM TO BEAR TO BE ACTED NANAKULI COMMITTEE. BY PROVIDING BOTH ACTIVITY LABOR CAPACITY AS SECURE AS WELL AS A SOUND ECONOMIC FUTURE IF YOU DO THAT WE WILL BE THERE WITH THE EQUITY. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER SOTO AND- I KNOW THAT THAT WE GOT SOME- QUICKER COMMENTS ON ON THE HAT THAT YOU'RE WEARING TODAY AND I JUST WANTED YOU TO BE AWARE THAT- WE HAD BOTH SOME. PRO AND CON COMMENTS BUT THAT THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AND- AND THE COMMENTS THAT- YOU'VE MADE IN REGARDS TO THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR CALIFORNIA- YOU'RE GONNA HATE TIGHT BECAUSE I THINK THERE MAY BE SOME QUESTIONS I DON'T KNOW WILL YOU BE AROUND- UNFORTUNATELY I HAVE A MEETING IN DOWNTOWN LA AND THEY HAVE TO. GRAB MY FACE MASK. TAKE MY DODGER CHAMPIONSHIP RING YEAH IT'S TOM IT IS REPEATED MIGHT BE ROLE I GUYS HEARTGARD JOHN IT WAS VERY LET ME ASK IF THERE'S ANY IF THERE ARE ANY- QUESTIONS OF YOU AT THIS POINT REGARDING YOUR PRESENTATION. SURE OTHER HABIT THE OTHER THAN THAT. OF YOUR CAP HAVE A GREAT TIME AT THE DODGER GAME TONIGHT. FOR BEING IN PERSON THANK YOU- I AM THANK YOU HAVE A GOOD DAY. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE WITH US. WE ABSOLUTE WE'RE GOING TO GET INTO THE WORK FORCE- DEVELOPMENT DISCUSSION WE'VE GOT TO INDIVIDUALS THAT WILL BE PRESENTING HERE. DOCTOR CAROL'S ABIN RESEARCH DIRECTOR UC BERKELEY CENTER FOR LABOR RESEARCH AND EDUCATION. AUTHOR OF- JUST TRANSITION YOU KNOW WORK THAT'S- COME OUT RECENTLY. AND DANIEL MACHINE ASSISTANT BUSINESS MANAGER IBEW BY SIX NINE IN THE IMPERIAL SAN DIEGO COUNTY AREA BOTH WILL HAVE FIVE TO EIGHT MINUTES. TO PRESENT- WE'RE MOVING ALONG QUITE WELL HERE THANK YOU MEMBERS FOR. YOUR PATIENCE IN PARTICIPATION SO WE'LL GO WITH DOCTOR CAROL ZABID AFFRONT YOURS. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMAN GARCIA AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK WITH YOU ALL. IN THIS REALLY AMAZING OPPORTUNITY- TO BUILD A SUPPLY CHAIN HERE IN CALIFORNIA. FROM FROM THE EXTRACTION ALL THE WAY TO RECYCLING- AND IN A WAY THAT CAN REALLY BUILD THE PROSPERITY IMPERIAL VALLEY AND OTHER PLACES IN CALIFORNIA ASKS TOM SOTO- VERY ELOQUENTLY- JUST STATED SO HE'S BACK TO FOLLOW- BUT- I THINK THAT ASSEMBLY MEN GARCIA INVITED ME BECAUSE I WAS THE LEAD AUTHOR OF A- PLAN THAT JOBS AND CLIMATE ACTION PLAN FOR TWENTY THIRTY THAT. HE IN FACT OF WROTE AND REQUESTED- IN AB THREE NINETY EIGHT A FEW YEARS AGO AND THE PURPOSE OF THAT PLAN WAS TO SAY WELL HOW DO WE REALLY SUPPORT WORKERS IN THE TRANSITION TO A CARBON NEUTRAL ECONOMY. AND SO I WANT TO USE WHAT WE LEARNED IN THAT PLAN AND IN THAT RESEARCH TOOK TO RELATE IT HERE- TO THIS. REALLY LARGE I HATE TO USE THE WORD INDUSTRIAL PLANNING EFFORT BECAUSE IT DOESN'T ALWAYS YOU KNOW THAT TERM DOESN'T ALWAYS FLY WITH ALL SECTORS OF THE- YOU KNOW OF OUR COMMUNITY BUT IT IT REALLY IS AN EFFORT TO PUT THE WHOLE THING TOGETHER AND USE GOVERNMENT RESOURCES- AND GOVERNMENT POLICY TO REALLY BUILD UP A FULL INDUSTRY THAT- THAT CAN NOT ONLY HELP MEET OUR CLIMATE GOALS BUT ALSO HELP. MEET OUR- EFFORTS TO REALLY REDUCE THAT HUGE ECONOMIC INEQUITIES THAT WE SEE AND THAT ARE PARTICULARLY PREVALENT IN PLACES LIKE PM IMPERIAL VALLEY AND THE ISSUE HERE IS THAT AT EACH STAGE OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN THAT WE ARE TRYING TO BUILD WE'RE CREATING JOBS THROUGH BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE INVESTMENT AND THOSE JOBS SOME OF THEM ARE PROFESSIONAL AND WE CAN TAP INTO ARE WONDERFUL YOU SEE AND STATE AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE INFRASTRUCTURE TO BUILD THE TECHNICAL SKILLS THAT ARE NEEDED AND A LOT OF THEM ARE. BLUE COLLAR WORKERS WHO- YOU KNOW SOMETIMES- GET. GOOD WAGES AND BENEFITS- BUT IN OUR ECONOMY ARE OFTEN PART OF ARE REALLY TERRIBLE TREND OF THE GROWTH OF LOW WAGE JOBS. AND BECAUSE THIS IS A BIG. EFFORT OF PUBLIC PRIVATE AND- YOU KNOW INTENSE GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION TO BUILD THE SUPPLY CHAIN WE CAN INFLUENCE WHETHER OR NOT. THE A NONPROFESSIONAL JOBS ARE GOOD JOBS WITH FAMILY SUPPORTING WAGES AND BENEFITS YOU KNOW IT REALLY USED TO BE THAT IN PLACES LIKE IMPERIAL VALLEY WE TENDED TO SAY ANY JOB IS BETTER THAN NO JOB- BUT WE'VE LEARNED THAT LOW WAGE JOBS ARE PROBLEM FOR FAMILIES COMMUNITIES AND ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT- SO I THINK. WE SEE WE DO ALSO HAVE THIS UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO JOIN THE TO EFFORTS OF CREATING A GOOD JOBS ECONOMY. AND BUILDING A NEW INDUSTRY THAT IS CLEAN AND HELPS US MEET OUR THAT THE- IN ON THE EXISTENTIAL CRISIS THAT WE'RE FACING WITH CLIMATE AND- WE HAVE TO DO THAT INTENTIONALLY- AND- WE HAVE THE TOOLS NOW TO LOOK AT WHICH INDUSTRIES ARE GETTING ARE GENERATING JOBS AND WHETHER OR NOT WE HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT THESE COULD BE LOW WAGE JOBS AND THEN LOOK AT THE SPECIFIC TOOLS THAT WE HAVE. THAT CAN COMPLEMENT THE OTHER GOVERNMENT POLICIES AND PROGRAMMES AND MANDATES AND PERMITTING PROCESSES- THAT CAN BE USED TO ENTICE THE BETTER EMPLOYERS TO HOLD THE EMPLOYERS THAT ARE INVESTING TO THEIR BEST BEHAVIOR BECAUSE OFTEN THEY HAVE BETTER BEHAVIOR IN PLACES LIKE EUROPE THAN THEY MIGHT IN THE U. S. BECAUSE EUROPE HOLDS THEM TO BETTER STANDARDS AND REALLY- BUILD WHAT WE CALL THE HIGH ROAD AND- YOU KNOW FROM THE CONSTRUCTION JOBS WHICH ARE GOING TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT AND DANNY'S% GONNA TALK TALK ABOUT- YOU KNOW BUILDING PROCESSING FACILITIES BUILDING MARTILLO THERMAL PLANTS BUILDING MANUFACTURING FACILITIES BUILDING RECYCLING FACILITIES. WE HAVE A REALLY S. AT TRIED AND TRUE METHODS THROUGH- PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENTS TO TAPPING INTO ARE INCREDIBLY VALUABLE APPRENTICESHIP- SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA WHICH IS THE GOLD STANDARD OF TRAINING FOR CONSTRUCTION WORKERS- WE HAVE. WAYS ENSURE THAT WE TAKE THE HIGH ROAD IN CONSTRUCTION AND I I'M I'M NOT GONNA STEAL DANTES THUNDER BECAUSE I THINK HE WILL BE VERY ARTICULATE AND TALKING ABOUT WHAT THE SPECIFIC TOOLS ARE AND WHAT THEIR- WHAT THE BENEFITS OF GOING THE HIGH ROAD ARE IN IMPERIAL VALLEY. IN ADDITION TO CONSTRUCTION THERE'S ALSO GONNA BE A LOT OF OTHER JOBS- AND I THINK WE CAN. LOOK AT OUR POLICIES AND PRACTICES TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE LABOR STANDARDS THAT WE DO ENTICE THEM THE BEST EMPLOYERS AND ENTICE EMPLOYERS TO BE THEIR BEST- AND- THAT'S NOT ALWAYS- A COMMON SET OF KNOWLEDGE OR OR OR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. WITHIN THAT THE TYPES OF- AGENCIES AND LEADERS WHO ARE. INVOLVED IN IN LANDING THE SCHOOL SUPPLY CHAIN- BUT I THINK OUR LABOR AGENCY REALLY DOES HAVE AN ENORMOUS CONTRIBUTION TO MAKE HERE AND THEY ARE DEVELOPING A TEAM TO WORK WITH DIFFERENT AGENCIES TO FIND THE APPROPRIATE LABOR STANDARDS AND THE APPROPRIATE SKILL STANDARDS THE APPROPRIATE UP WAGE STANDARDS THAT CAN HELP INSURE THAT THESE ARE GOOD JOBS AND ALSO THAT THERE ARE PATHWAYS INTO THEM. FOR FOLKS WHO HAVE BEEN. LEFT OUT OF GOOD OF THE GOOD JOBS ECONOMY SO I THINK I WILL- AND THEN A FINAL POINT IS THAT THE TRAINING HAS TO FOLLOW THAT YOU KNOW THEY'RE THERE AGAIN THERE ARE PROFESSIONAL JOBS THAT. WHERE ARE YOU UNIVERSITIES AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE GOING TO HAVE A REAL CLEAR ROLE. IN THE OTHER JOBS THE NONPROFESSIONAL JOBS TRAINING IS STILL IMPORTANT BUT IT HAS TO BE INDUSTRY BASED WE HAVE A WONDERFUL HIGH ROAD TRAINING PARTNERSHIP INITIATIVE THAT JUST GOT AN EXTRA TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN THIS BUDGET. WHERE IT FUNDS LABOR MANAGEMENT PARTNERSHIPS OR OTHER INDUSTRY LED PARTNERSHIPS WHERE WORKERS HAVE A REAL VOICE- AND ARE VALUED IN THAT PARTNERSHIP TO IN TERMS OF DEVELOPING TRAINING AND IMPLEMENTING TRAINING AND BENEFITING FROM TRAINING. SO I DO THINK WE HAVE MODELS VERY INNOVATIVE MODELS AND IN THE STATE FOR ADDRESSING WORKPLACE. AND INDUSTRY BASED. TRAINING THAT REALLY CAN UP LIFT THE pWORKERS HAVE A VOICE AND A CAREER. AND OUR AND THE WORK FORCE IS REFLECTIVE OF ALL OF CALIFORNIA. SO THANK YOU THANK YOU DOCTOR THANK YOUNG SHOULD THERE BE SOME QUESTIONS FOR YOU AS I HAVE ONE YEAR NOTED FROM A COLLEAGUE WHO IS A PRESENT BUT WANTED TO DIRECT A QUESTION TO YOU WHAT WILL HAVE A- MR DANIEL MACHINE- B. R. LASSEN FINAL SPEAKER AND THEN WE'LL JUMP INTO- QUESTIONS.

BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY TO OUR REGION HAS PHASE ONE OF THE HIGHEST UNEMPLOYMENT RATES IN THE STATE OF THE DECADES. ARE THE PATHWAY TO GO THE NUMBER BOSS. BATTERY SUPPLY CHAIN WORKFORCE THAT WILL SUPPORT THIS EMERGING AND LEAVE HIM INDUSTRY IS THE STATE'S FOR THE FIVE ELECTRICAL APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS. I WANTED TO SHARE WITH YOU A LITTLE BIT OF THE CURRENT I B. W. THREE SIXTY NINE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM RIGHT HERE IN OUR REGION. IMPERIAL COUNTY WE HAVE THE ELECTRICAL TRAINING INSTITUTE A STATE CERTIFIED APPRENTICESHIP FACILITY. THE PARTNER PROGRAM IS APPROVED BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS AND MEETS ALL CALIFORNIA DIVISION OF APPRENTICESHIP STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS AND REQUIREMENTS. AS WELL OF THE FATAL DEPARTMENT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. I PROMISES WERE I THINK PROJECTS UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF GENTLEMEN TRANSIENTS. WILL TEACH THEM THE ELECTRICAL TRADE. DURING THE APPRENTICESHIP TRAINING THERE AREN'T ANY COME ALONG WITH ALL THE BENEFITS. AND THE BILL CREDITS TOWARDS A PENSION. I WILL EARLIER SKILL APPRENTICESHIP TRAINING IT'S A PATHWAY INTO A MIDDLE CLASS CAREER INDIA ECHO INDUSTRY. I NEED ONLY IF I SIXTEEN I MEMBERS LEAVE AND WORK IN THE VALLEY HAVE CONSTRUCTED OVER TWO THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF RENEWABLE ENERGY SINCE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE. HOLDER WHEN I SWALLOW ANY ENERGY STORAGE. THESE PROJECTS HAVE GENERATED GOOD PAINTBALL. GOOD PAYING JOBS AND HAVE PROVIDED SKILL TRAINING AND BENEFITS IN THE ECONOMICALLY HARMFUL BLEACHING. BY THIS YOU CAN SEE THERE IS A WELL ESTABLISHED LOCAL ELECTRICAL WORKFORCE IMPERIAL COUNTY. IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ALL OTHER TRADES SUCH AS PLUMBERS AND PIPE FITTERS CARPENTERS IRONWORKERS SHEETMETAL AND MANY MORE HAVE VERY SIMILAR APPRENTICESHIP AND TRAINING REQUIREMENTS ON PROGRAMS. WITH THE RIGHT POLICIES OUR SYSTEM PLACE THE EMERGING MEDIUM AND- CAN EQUALLY CREATE NEW HIGH ROAD JOB OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPERIAL COUNTY. LOCAL WORKFORCE A NEW SKILL APPRENTICESHIP TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES PARK COMMUNITY MEMBERS. FROM A LOCAL COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND WORK FIRST PERSON PERSPECTIVE WE URGE THESE SELECT COMMITTEE TO A BACK PROBLEM INTO THE STATEWIDE INITIATIVE. OR RELATED POLICIES. NUMBER ONE REQUIRE PREVAILING WAGES IN STRONG WORKFORCE. AND LABOR STANDARDS THAT CREATE HIGH QUALITY JOBS FOR LOCAL COMMUNITY MEMBERS. AND SUPPORT LOCAL STATE CERTIFIED APPRENTICESHIP OPPORTUNITIES WE MUST ENSURE PROPOSAL EIGHT PM AND LOCAL PROJECTS FOLLOW THE SAME HIGH ROADS DELPORTE QUICKER AS NOBLE ENERGY PROJECTS BUILT IN IMPERIAL COUNTY INCLUDING PARTIAL PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENTS POPULIST. NUMBER TO ENTER ANY EFFORTS IMPERIAL KONG COMPLEMENT THE ON GOING TO WORK AT THE SOLVENCY TO PROTECT PUBLIC. HEALTH AND RESTORE HABITAT. I DON'T TO THE HEALTH OF OUR IMPERIAL COUNTY. NUMBER THREE IN ARE PROJECTS ARE BEING DONE IN A WAY THAT IS ENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE AND SAFE FOR WORKERS AND SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES. ALSO TIES INTO POINT NUMBER ONE ENSURING PROPER SKILLS IN TWENTY FOUR CONSTRUCTION. OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL IS CRITICAL TO HELP ENSURE FACILITIES ARE RUNNING SAFELY. AGAIN I CANNOT EMPHASIZE ENOUGH OF THE OPPORTUNITIES ON THIS NEW INDUSTRY. AND I TOLD HIM INDUSTRY SUPPORT INCLUDING TRANSPORTATION. AND WHATNOT WHAT WAS. I SELECT ALSO VACATION ACCELERATES AND DEMANDS FOR WHICH STARTS CONTINUES. WE WILL NEED A WHOLE LOT OF LITHIUM. THIS MEANS MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR TRAINING AND APPRENTICESHIPS FOR ALL TRAITS. THANK YOU AGAIN JERRY GARCIA AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS ALLOW ME TO THAT TAXIS BECOME THESE VERY IMPORTANT MATTER. WHAT KIND OF BUILDING TRADES AND I BEAT OUTSIDE SIXTY NOW STANDS READY TO WORK CLOSELY WITH YOU IN BUILDING OUR- BATTERY MANUFACTURING RENEWABLE ENERGY WORKFORCE THANK YOU AGAIN THANK YOU SIR AND- WE APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE WITH US WE'RE GOING TO. NOW OPEN IT UP FOR QUESTIONS AND I KNOW THERE WAS A QUESTION THAT PERHAPS THE COMMISSIONER DOUGLAS CAN CAN FLAG OF FROM MY COLLEAGUE- TO MY RIGHT HERE. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN WE- CAN BE ONE SECOND PLEASE. A QUESTION FROM ONE OF OUR OLLEAGUES IS ACTUALLY WATCHING THE HEARING AS WE'RE DISCUSSING SOME OF THE BE AT THE PRESENTATIONS TODAY IS- CAN WE HOW MUCH LITHIUM CAN BE EXTRACTED OUT OF IMPERIAL COUNTY. AND HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE TO GET IT UP TO SPEED. THE ESTIMATES OF HOW MUCH LITHIUM COULD BE EXTRACTED FROM- IMPERIAL COUNTY ARE. VERY HIGH- IT COULD BE A- VERY SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF. CALIFORNIA'S DEMANDS NATIONAL DEMAND EVEN- INTERNATIONAL DEMANDED AND I'M GOING TO ALSO DID NOTE BACK TO OUR STAFF TO GET THE MOST RECENT NUMBERS BUT THERE HIGH- IN TERMS OF SCALE UP- I THINK WHAT WE'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW IS THAT THERE'S A REAL OPPORTUNITY. RIGHT NOW FOR CALIFORNIA TO BECOME A PLAYER IN THE LITHIUM SUPPLY CHAIN THERE ARE SEVERAL COMPANIES THAT HAVE MANAGED TO. GET OFF TAKE AGREEMENTS- FOR LISTENING- AND- THIS HAS THE POTENTIAL TO- TO SNOWBALL THE BRING FOR INVESTMENT BUT WE REALLY DO YOU KNOW THE INDUSTRY. REPRESENTATIVES OF WHO WE'VE BEEN INTERFACING WITH. INDUSTRY IN PARTICULAR AND THE AUTO MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY THAT REALLY OF THE SITES THAT WE DO NEED TO MOVE FORWARD QUICKLY THIS OPPORTUNITY AS A WINDOW IN TIME BUT- THE LITHIUM MARKET IN OTHER PLACES AND SO. WE REALLY DO NEED TO BE FOCUSED ON. ON ON THE OPPORTUNITIES AND INVESTMENT. BRINGING THIS TO FRUITION NOW. NASA AS A FOLLOW UP AND BE ADDITIONAL CONVERSATIONS AROUND EXTRACTION AND LITHIUM AND THE NEED THAT WE HAVE FOR PRODUCTION HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ARE ALSO. INTERTWINED AND THE- IN IN THE CONVERSATIONS AROUND ENVIRONMENTALISM IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY ALSO BEGINNING GAUGE AND I'M CURIOUS PERSPECTIVES IN TERMS OF WHAT THOSE CONVERSATIONS HAVE BEEN LIGHT. UP I HAVE BEEN LIKE ON THE GROUND- WITH SOME ENVIRO GROUPS BECAUSE YES CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO BE SELF RELIANT- THERE'S LOOKING PRODUCTION ALL OVER THE WORLD BUT IF WE ARE TRULY GOING TO LEAD AND FORMER STATIONS ROTH CLIMATE CHANGE AND REDUCTION OF FOSSIL FUELS. THEN WHAT IS THE REALITY OF THAT FOR OUR STATE AND WHERE DO ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS FALLEN. SO IT'S A IT'S A BIG QUESTION IS. LET ME TAKE IT IN AND ARTS AND THEN IF I IF I MISS A PART PLEASE PLEASE LET ME KNOW- THE- ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS HAVE TRADITIONALLY BEEN VERY SUPPORTIVE OF GEOTHERMAL ENERGY. BECAUSE IT'S A WAY OF GETTING- OUR OUR HIGH CAPACITY FACTOR QUITE A LOT OF RENEWABLE POWER FROM A RELATIVELY LOW. LAND USE IMPACT IN A RELATIVELY LOW ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT SO. ENVIRONMENTALLY ON. GEOTHERMAL POWER IS IT HAS BEEN SEEN VERY POSITIVELY AND- IS A REALLY GOOD OPTION FOR ANY NUMBER OF REASONS. IT'S ALSO A TECHNOLOGY THAT HAS. EXISTED IN THE IMPERIAL VALLEY. FOR A LONG TIME SO I THINK THERE'S A HIGH DEGREE OF CAN. UNDERSTANDING AND ACCEPT OF WHAT THE PROTECT. IS AS WE MOVE INTO. THE LITHIUM. RECOVERY COMP. AND SEEN SHOW AS- AN OBSERVER IN SUPPORT. OF THE- BLUE RIBBON CAN- THE ABOUT COMMISSION- THERE ARE IS A NEW. TO INCREASE CA- UNDER OF WHAT RECOVERY REALLY ISN'T AND WE'RE DEFINITELY SEEING THAT- THERE ARE ANY NUMBER OF QUESTIONS COMING IN SO THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE CONCERNED THAT. THAT THE PROPOSAL WOULD BE TO USE WATER FROM THE SALT SEA RATHER THAN GEO THERMAL PROVINCE WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR THE SALTON SEA THERE THAT YOU KNOW THERE ARE THERE ARE ANY NUMBER OF QUESTIONS. COMING UP WHERE IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT FROM A COMMUNITY OUTREACH PERSPECTIVE FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF ENGAGING WITH THE EQUITY GROUPS ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE GROUPS YOU KNOW THERE'S A REAL NEED. TO HELP FOSTER THE LEVEL OF COMMUNICATION AND INFORMATION SHARING THAT WILL ENSURE THAT THE COMMUNITY- IS ENGAGING UNDERSTANDS WHAT THIS IS ABOUT AND UNDERSTANDS BENEFITS OF THE POTENTIAL HERE BUT BUT ALSO HAS A VOICE IN. HOW IT'S BROUGHT FORWARD AND SO- THE LITHIUM VALLEY COMMISSION IS GOING TO DO- A. AS PUBLIC MEETING IN COORDINATION WITH ASSEMBLYMEMBER GARCIA'S OFFICE- COMING UP BUT YOU KNOW THE COUNTY HAS OFFERED. TO HOST ADDITIONAL PUBLIC INFORMATION SESSIONS AND WE DO HAVE. MEMBERS OF- THE LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AND ALSO. NATIVE AMERICAN AND OTHER TRIBES AND- OTHER GROUPS TO WHO ARE ENGAGED IN THE COMMISSION AND CAN HELP. WITH THAT MUNICH CATIONS. I'LL STOP THERE I DON'T KNOW IF I HIT EVERYTHING THANK YOU COUNTY FOLLOW UP ON SOMETHING THAT YOU SAID THIS IS RAMESH- SO ON THE ONE THING THAT WE SHOULD ALSO KEEP IN MIND IS THE SCIENCE OF THE SEPARATION PROCESSES. AS A BALD KOMMT CONSIDERABLY. THERE'S A LOT MORE KNOWN WITHIN THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SYSTEM THE UNIVERSITIES AS WELL AS A NATIONAL LABS I KNOW COLLEAGUES OF MINE KID ADOBE IL. ARE REALLY DOING IT ALL WEIGH DIFFERENT SEPARATION THAN WHAT HAPPENED A MOUNTAIN PASS FOR EXAMPLE WHEN I WAS DOING MY PHD ON THIS TOPIC. SO THERE IS A HUGE AMOUNT OF DISCOVERY THAT CAN LEAD TO A MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY WAY OF SEPARATING THE TWO. THANK YOU OUR DOCTOR THANK YOU COMMISSIONER I THINK YOU KNOW I I'VE HEARD A COUPLE OF TERMS. ALONG THE WAY BETWEEN- EXTRACTIONS. RECOVERY AND SEPARATION. AND ALL I THINK- REALLY DEFINING- THIS NEW. APPROACH THAT EXIST AND- IN THIS CASE AT THE SALTON SEA- PERHAPS- APPLICABLES TERMINOLOGY- TO REGIONS. LIKE THE ONES THAT ARE ON MY COLLEAGUES DISTRICT- MR LACKEY RIGHT ALL I THINK LEADING TO THE MESSAGE BEING. THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO DO THIS IN A MUCH MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY- SUSTAINABLE FRIENDLY- MANNER AND I'LL TELL YOU THAT- BUILDING OFF OF THE QUESTION AND THE AND THE RESPONSE. YES LOCALLY THERE ARE A NUMBER OF EFFORTS TO IT ENHANCE THE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT PART OF THIS DISCUSSION UTILIZING THE COMMISSION THE CDC OVERSEAS BUT ALSO- THE MEMBERSHIP OF THE COMMISSION- THE APPOINTED COMMISSIONERS IS MADE UP OF- DIVERSE GROUPS OF THE ECONOMY. I JUST INDUSTRY NOT JUST SELECTED LEADERS BUT BY A COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION REPRESENTATIVES AS WELL AS ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AND- ENVIRONMENTAL. GROUPS THAT ARE TRADITIONALLY WOULD ENGAGE IN THESE DISCUSSIONS BUT IT IS OUR JOB TO INCREASE THE LEVEL OF ENGAGEMENT PARTICIPATION FOR PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN- EXTRACTION GREW- READ RECOVERY AND SEPARATION- AND REALLY GET OUR HANDS AROUND- THIS OPPORTUNITY IN FRONT OF US OF THE GOOD QUESTION THANK YOU FOR. FOR RAISING THAT QUESTION. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS YES CONSUMERS WITH JUST A FEW GOING DOWN THROUGH THE LINE AND I'M GLAD ASSEMBLYMAN LACKEY COME BACK WHENEVER GUARDS TO BAR ON AND SALTON SEA. ARE MAKE SURE AND IT MAY BE A QUESTION FOR KAREN THAT THERE'S ENOUGH R. AND D. MONEY FOR DIFFERENT AREAS IN THE STATE OF LITHIUM IS FOUND. THAT IT THAT THAT EVERYBODY GETS THEIR FAIR SHARE WE JUST DON'T CONCENTRATE NECESSARILY INSULTS YOU KNOW DON'T TAKE NOTHING FROM HEADWATERS DISTRICT. BUT AS A LINES GET DRAWN THE BORON MINE AND LACKEYS DISTRICTS ABOUT THREE MILES WEST OF MY DISTRICT SO IF THE LINES MOVE JUST A LITTLE BIT IT MIGHT BE IN MY DISTRICT. IN THE NEXT TEN YEARS. BUT BUT JUST KIND OF KEEP THAT IN PERSPECTIVE THAT WE DON'T JUST ZERO IN ON ONE SECTOR IN CALIFORNIA AND MAKE SURE WE OPEN AT ALL OF. AND THEN THE DOCTOR RELEASED YOU KNOW ME YOU MENTIONED EARLIER ON VOTE OF FIVE TERM PAPERS. THAT TO PUBLISHED. YES I CAN WE GET COPIES OF THAT BECAUSE YOU MENTIONED MENTIONED MOUNTAIN PASS WHICH IS IN MY DISTRICT IN. UP I HAVE A LOT OF MINING IN MY DISTRICT. YES REALLY INTERESTED IN READING SOME OF THOSE TERMS- AS WE SAY WE READ A BOOK OR TWO A DAY SO. IT MORE READING FOR US. YEAH THANK YOU T THE END OF. HIS WE WORK FORWARD. AS THIS COMMITTEE GOES FORWARD I LOOK FORWARD TO THE LEGISLATION. EXPANDING UP TO THE MOBILE OF. FROM FIFTY TO A HUNDRED MEGAWATTS. MAKE IT EASIER FOR THE INVESTMENT TO DO A LOT FOR JUST LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. PERMITTING PROCESS TAX CREDITS IN OPPORTUNITY ZONES. AND BUT UP. YOURSELF EDUARDO THIS COMMITTEE AND LEGISLATION THAT SURE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH SOME OF THAT SO WE CAN ALL WORK TOGETHER PARTNER IN THIS THANK YOU MISS SMITH AND APPRECIATE THE- THE COMMENTS OF LOOKING AT CALIFORNIA AS A WHOLE- FOR. THE PURPOSE OF. AGAIN BEING A LEADER- IN THIS- AREA OF- CLEAN TECHNOLOGY. AND MEETING OUR CLIMATE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES- BUT. QUESTION MISTER LOOKED AS- A RESERVE. I DO A QUESTION FOR DOCTOR- WE SEE THE BUILD OUT OF- SOLAR- FROM THE BEGINNING TO THE PRESENT TIME. WHAT ARE SOME OF THE LESSONS LEARNED IN TERMS OF- PROGRAMS INCENTIVES APPROACHES. THAT YOU CAN KIND OF TOUCH ON THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE APPLICABLES HERE- THAT WITH THIS- DISCUSSION ON LITHIUM RECOVERY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. YEAH THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION BUT WHEN WE STARTED SON SHOT IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN. WE TOOK ALL OF THE GOVERNMENT APPROACH WHICH WHICH MEANS WE SAID THAT WE ALL SORT OF THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES AND WE WANT THEM TO BE SUCCESSFUL GET THE BENEFITS OF THE TAX CREATED BY US BUT- SO IF YOU SOME CHART WHEN I WAS THERE ARE ALSO PART OF THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR. TO YOUR PROGRAM. OXIMETRY THE ORDER OF MANY OF THE PROGRAMS THAT WITHIN. THE APPLIED PARTS OF DEAL WEEKS SO WITH THAT WE HAD FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES AND THE YOUR I WAS THAT BIG TO YOURS I WAS THAT WE DONE ABOUT. TWENTY TO TWENTY TWO DIFFERENT FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES. SOME OF THEM WERE OF THE SCALE OF THE MILLION DOLLARS R. D. OPPORTUNITY. AND SOME OF THEM WENT ALL THE WAY UP TO A FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR OPPORTUNITY WHICH IS VERY MUCH FOCUS ON MANUFACTURING. MANY OF THEM HAVE COST SHARE REQUIREMENTS TYPICALLY. ONE TO ONE OR TWO TO ONE COST SHARE REQUIREMENTS BECAUSE WE WANT THE PRIVATE SECTOR. TO HAVE A SKIN IN THE GAME. AND WE WERE TRYING TO OVERTLY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT LEVERAGE WHICH MEANS IF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PUTS A DOLLAR IN. THAT YOU GET THREE DOLLARS WORTH OF BENEFIT BY LEVERAGING NOT ONLY THE PRIVATE SECTOR BUT IN THE CASE OF CALIFORNIA I KNOW. KAREN AND DAVID HOCHSCHILD AND BEFORE THAT BOB. AND THEY'VE BEEN FANTASTIC INSTANCE YOU SEE A CO INVESTING IN MANY THINGS. SO THAT YOU CAN BIGGER BENEFIT FROM THE FEDERAL INVESTMENT. BUT THE UPPER END OF IT I THINK STEVEN TALK ABOUT IT. WE HAD THE LOAN GUARANTEE WE STILL HAVE THE LOAN GUARANTEE PROGRAM. THE LOAN GUARANTEE PROGRAM IS IN SOME SENSE OF IN SIMPLE TERMS. IT'S A DELISTING PROGRAM FOR VERY RISKY PROJECTS. ESPECIALLY IN THE MANUFACTURING OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES. THAT IS PERHAPS THE MOST DIFFICULT PART IN THE WHOLE ECOSYSTEM. AND THEREFORE WE HAD WE I DID A LOT OF DILIGENCE AND THE LOAN GUARANTEE PROGRAMS- IN TERMS OF HELPING COMPANIES- GO FORWARD WITH THE PROPOSAL'S. SO HOW DOES SPEC OF. I WANT TO FOCUS ON. PART I CAN YOU WHAT YOU WOULD SIX. AND I WILL ALSO TELL YOU WHAT WE WOULD NOT VERY SUCCESSFUL. AND DUCK THERE WERE SOME LESSONS LEARNED THE FIRST THING WAS TO BE RECOGNIZED EARLY ON I DO BECAUSE I COMMEND MY TEAM MEMBER SAID DOE. YES FOLKS WERE JUST AMAZING- IS NOT. A BIG PORTION OF THE COST OF SOLAR WAS THE SOFT COST. TERMS ARE PEOPLE ARE FOCUSING ON THE PANEL COSTS AND STUFF BUT CHINA WAS DOING A LOT OF THE MANUFACTURING. AND THEY WERE BRINGING THE COST DOWN BY. THE WAS A TIME WHERE THE COST OF. RUNNING THE STORE OF THE FINANCING THE INTERCONNECT ISSUES THE INSPECTION ALL OF THOSE THINGS WERE VERY VERY EXPENSIVE. SO ONE SUNTRUST DID WAS REALLY TO PUT A BIG FOCUS ON THE SO CALLED SOFT COST. ONCE WE LAUNCHED PROGRAMS- PEOPLE ATTRIBUTE THIRD PARTY FINANCING FOR EXAMPLE BACK IN TWENTY TEN DODD WAS NOT VERY POPULAR TODAY THAT'S BASICALLY THE VERY ACCEPTED PROCESS. BY WHICH YOU CAN DO THESE KINDS OF FINANCING. HOW DOES ONE OVERCOME INERTIA INCOMES OF THE UTILITIES INCOME SO INTEGRATING SOLAR WHICH IS A VERY BILL RESOURCE WHAT I'M- INTO THE NETWORK AND WE WORKED. QUITE A BIT WITH THE UTILITIES SOME OF THEM WERE VERY EASY TO WORK SOMEWHAT A LITTLE BIT. MORE DIFFICULT. THE ONE THING THAT- I. YEAH WOULD HAVE LIKED A DONE MORE. IS MANY. I HAVE TO TELL YOU ALL. I'M VERY OBSESSED ABOUT MANUFACTURING WITHIN THE UNITED STATES WE NEED TO MAKE A KID IN THIS COUNTRY AND STELLAR WORK WHITE. AND SO WE HAD GOTTEN INTO THIS GAME A LITTLE BIT LATER BECAUSE CHINA HAD ALREADY MIDDLE PART OF THE INVESTMENT TODAY 90% OF SOLAR MANUFACTURING. IS IN CHINA. AND IS NOW COMMODITIZED SORTS BUT YOU DIFFICULT FOR A NEW TECHNOLOGY- THAT'S BASED ON NEW INVENTIONS TO MAKE IT THERE. I'M NOT WAS ONE OF THE BIG LESSONS LEARNED THE ONE THING THAT I WAS PUSHING FOR PART I WAS HONORED TO BE DO AT THAT POINT. YES IF YOU REALLY WANTED TO THE MANUFACTURING THE FINANCIAL SECTOR HAS TO BE INFORMED WAY AHEAD OF RATED WHAT'S- TYPICALLY WE DON'T DO THE INNOVATION BIRD WALKS I'LL GIVE YOU A QUICK NUMBER AND THEN I'LL FINISH UP. IF YOU LOOK AT FINANCING IN EQUITY FINANCING 75% OF THAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE U. S. IN THE SOLAR SPACE. WHICH MADE A LOT OF START UP COMPANIES ALL OF THOSE GUYS PUT EQUITY FINANCING. ON DEBT FINANCING ONLY 11% WASN'T THE U. S. BACK FINANCING IS WHERE YOU BRING FACTORIES TO MAKE PRODUCTS AND SOUGHT. WE WILL NOT DOING THAT WELL BECAUSE OUR TWO SECTORS IN THE FINANCIAL SECTOR WERE DISCONNECTED. AND THEREFORE I THINK WHEN WE START TO PUT THE LITHIUM KANEMI TOGETHER PERHAPS WE SHOULD GET ALL OF THEM INTO THE SAME ROOM. WHEN WE MAKE ALL THE DECISIONS SO THAT WE KNOW HOW THE MANUFACTURER IS GOING TO HAPPEN. WHEN IT GETS TO MONETIZE THE MARGIN SO SALUTE- THEN YOU REALLY NEED THE SUPPORT OF THE BIG FINANCIAL SECTORS ALL THE PEOPLE WHO BILLION FACTORS FOR US. NOT I THINK WAS A BIG LEARNING EXPERIENCE WHAT ALSO WAS A LITTLE BIT TOO LATE. AND WE WERE CERTAIN GOING FORWARDI KNOW WE DISCUSSED IT EXTENSIVELY IN THE TRANSITION TEAM DISCUSSIONS WE WERE PUSHING VERY HARD TO HAVE. THE FINANCIAL SECTOR INVOLVED. UP FRONT RATHER THAN AFTERWARDS SO I I'M THAT ENSUED. YOUR JONES. THANK YOU IT DOES AT THE CAN GIVE US A CLUE ON. WHAT COULD DO DE- WHAT WE COULD GIVE. AND DOUBT KEEPING CERTAIN IN MY- GOT A QUESTION FOR DAN FITS. THE LOOKING AT HIS BACKGROUND YOU KNOW HE HE PREVIOUSLY. OVERSEEN- THE CALIFORNIA PRICE OWN- PROGRAMS THAT WERE IN EXISTENCE AND EARLIER ONE OF THE COMMENTS WAS MENTIONED. ABOUT THE EXPANSION OF THE OPPORTUNITY ZONES- DIFFERENT PROGRAMS- DIFFERENT- TYPE OF INCENTIVES BUT NEVER THE LESS- PUTTING FORWARD- AN OPPORTUNITY TO STIMULATE THE GROWTH OF CERTAIN THE ECONOMIES INDUSTRIES. CAN YOU CAN YOU JUST TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT- MISTER FITZ GERALD IN TERMS OF HOW YOU SEE- THAT FIT. INTO THIS CONVERSATION YOUR FAMILIARITY WITH PRIOR PROGRAMS WHY THE NO LONGER EXIST AND NOW- THIS OPPORTUNITY- WITH THE OPPORTUNITIES ALMOST TO PERHAPS- BE UTILIZED AS A TOOL. YEAH WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF HISTORY THEY'RE GOING TO SOMEONE NUMBERS L. DOT NET. AND SO I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION NOW- SO ENTERPRISE AND OBVIOUSLY THEY THEY WENT AWAY QUITE SOME TIME AGO AND AS MR KELLY TALKED ABOUT THE- I THINK THAT THEY- KNOW THE EVOLUTIONS THAT OCCUR IN TERMS OF THE CALIFORNIA COMPETES PROGRAMS. ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL I THINK YOU KNOW THE SUCCESSOR. WELL YOU KNOW TODAY WHAT WE SEE IN THE RETENTION TAX CREDIT I THINK THOSE THOSE ARE YOU KNOW I THINK THE EVOLUTION OF THOSE TAX CREDITS I CERTAINLY COME ABOUT I THE OPPORTUNITY ZONES ARE. THANK YOU I THINK THE DAY THEY FUNCTION MUCH BETTER IN TERMS OF SOME CONSTITUENTS AUSTIN'S ODD THAT THAT ARE PLACED I THINK THE EXPANSION AND INCUSION OF. LICKING VALLEY OU'RE LOOKING IN AREAS- IT CERTAINLY WOULD BE IMPORTANT FOR THAT BECAUSE IT DOESN'T COURAGE DOES REGIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR THOSE THAT INSTITUTIONAL INVESTMENT OBVIOUSLY THE. OPPORTUNITY ZONES. THEY THEY'RE KIND OF INTERESTING- I'M NOT YOU KNOW UPDATE HOMEWORK I DONE WITH THE IS THAT THEY KIND OF CREATED A OF A OF A SMALL GOLD RUSH RICK'S PARENTS THAT I. HERE IN YOU KNOW CERTAINLY THE OPERA. ARE AREAS WERE WHERE THERE'S AN ATTEMPT CREATE SOME FUN. I IT WAS A LITTLE BIT QUICK TO SEND JOE IF THEY WAS NEXT. FOR THAT ARE. ON TO THE WITH YOU AND WE SEE YOU KNOW I. MR START COMING ON TALKING TO IT. AUSTER STAND. IN UNDERSTOOD. THAT YOU TO DO THINGS IN A- INTERNETWORKING PRACTICE MATTER. SURE THAT SUPPORTS. AND LYFT. AND SO BY HAVING. ZONE WHERE. OTHER MAKING EXTRACTION WITH MANUFACTURING WORKER. WOULD CREATE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT CERTAINLY FOR THOSE INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS AND I THINK THAT THERE ARE. THERE ARE SOME POSITIVES FOR OPPORTUNITIES DOUBTS I ALSO THINK. YOU KNOW. CERTAINLY THERE ARE SOME SOME NEGATIVE. SO ALL RIGHT DON'T THINK THEY SO I PROJECT TO SERVE SMALL BUSINESSES PER SE- BEAR THERE DESIGNED TO SUPPORT LARGE. ENOUGH WE CAN HAVE. SOME VERY LARGE BUSINESSES SUCH AS BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INVOLVED IN THIS. IT MAY BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE WORK WORKING AT. AND GET A GREAT ACTOR. THANKS GOOD I DO A FOR DR CAROL ZABID IT'S FROM ONE OF OUR OTHER. MEMBERS OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ALTHOUGH NOT PRESENT IT SAID THIS QUESTION IN QUESTION IS DOES THE REGION HAVE SUFFICIENT POST SECONDARY EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES TO ENSURE JOB GROWTH. RESULTING FROM A LITHIUM MARKET. AND IT'S UP THE DENTAL BENEFITS- THIS QUESTION CAME FROM- SOME MEMBER CHAD MAYES AND SO ADOPTED YET THE THOUGHTS ON THAT. YOU KNOW I'M NOT AN EXPERT IN THIS REGION BUT I WOULD SAY THAT- I THINK WHAT REALLY IS CRITICAL IS THERE IS FUNDING AND THERE IS- THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO REALLY BUILD IN THIS. TRAINING PARTNERSHIPS AND AGAIN THAT'S THE KEY IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT YOU KNOW PREPARING WORKERS- IN EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS IT'S REALLY ABOUT WORK IN INDUSTRY PARTNERSHIPS TO UNDERSTAND. THE NEEDS OF ALL COLORS THE NEEDS OF WORKERS TOGETHER. TO DEFINE WHAT THE TRAINING NEEDS AND USUALLY WITH THAT IF THERE'S FUNDING THEM COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND ASKING THE OTHER INSTITUTIONS THAT HIGHER ED INSTITUTIONS ARE NOT RESPONDING. RIGHT BUT THEY NEED TO BE ON THE RESPONSE. TO POSITION NOT IN THE- YOU KNOW LEAD AND OF- NEW DEGREE PROGRAMS AND TELL THOSE ARE REALLY DEFINED BY THE INDUSTRY AND OFTEN THEY'LL BE WORKPLACE BASED PROGRAMS LIKE APPRENTICESHIP I MEAN THE BEAUTY OF APPRENTICESHIP. IS REALLY THAT IT DOES IT EASILY. EXPANDS TO MEET DEMAND RACKS TO WHAT WHAT GOES DOWN SO IT'S REALLY THERE IS A DIRECT AND COMPLETE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE JOB AND THE TRAINING. THANK YOU SO YEAH THANKS THANK YOU I DO KNOW THAT THE COMMISSION IS- HOLDING OUT SUB COMMITTEE GROUPS IN THE WORK FORCE EDUCATION AREA AND HAS NUMBER OF INSTITUTIONS ENGAGE FROM SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY UC RIVERSIDE TO THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY COLLEGES WHICH IS A- POSITIVE THING AND ALIGNED WITH WHAT YOU'VE JUST SAID I'VE GOT ONE MORE QUESTION HERE. FOR STEVEN BOYD AND- AND THEN WE'LL WRAP THIS UP GOING TO PUBLIC COMMENTS THE QUESTION IS HOW DO WE ENSURE ELECTRIC CARS BECOME ACCESSIBLE AND AFFORDABLE TO EVERYONE AND- THAT'S KIND OF THE BACK OF THE MINDS OF A LOT OF PEOPLE PARTICULARLY IN DISTRICTS LIKE OURS. WHO HEAR ABOUT THE ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND INFRASTRUCTURE JOBS AND THINGS OF THAT SORT THE QUESTION IS WILL. HOW MY UNIFORM- WHEELED VEHICLES AND SO PERHAPS THAT STEVE WOULD YOU HAVE SOME THOUGHTS ON THAT. GIVEN THE BACKGROUND OF YOUR WORK. SURE SURE WELL AS I MENTIONED- A LOT OF OUR WORK IS IN THE RESEARCH PHASE AND IS REALLY FOCUSED ON LOWERING THE COST OF THESE ADVANCED VEHICLE TECHNOLOGIES INCLUDING BATTERIES WHICH I TALKED ABOUT TODAY- WE'RE ALSO FOCUSED ON REDUCING THE COSTS FOR ELECTRIC DRIVE SYSTEMS. AND THE CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S REQUIRED FOR THESE VEHICLES AND SO REALLY SORT OF ACROSS THE BOARD WERE DOING RESEARCH THAT DIRECTLY ADDRESSES THE- SOME OF THE UP FRONT CAPITAL COSTS THAT WE KNOW TO BE REAL BARRIERS TO ADOPTING THESE TECHNOLOGIES. ALSO MENTIONED- ORI WILL MENTION THAT- WE'RE WE'RE VERY FOCUSED ON- BOTH GOT A COMMUNITY INITIATIVES AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE INITIATIVES THAT CAN BE HELPFUL IN TERMS OF A TOP SOURCE TECHNOLOGIES. THANK YOU SIR I'M GONNA ASK ALL OF THE PANELISTS WHO ARE WITH US AT THE COMMISSION DOLLARS HERE DR- EACH. SHOP IS TO BELIEVE- BELIEVE- DR CAROL. ZABIT IS STILL HERE AND DANIEL- AND AT THE END OF HIS JOKE MAYBE IT JUST THE GLASS OF THE CLOSING COMMENTS ON YOUR END BEFORE WE GET INTO PUBLIC COMMENTS AND THEN. CLOSING REMARKS OR MAYBE JUST A QUICK LITTLE WHAT MINUTE ROUND OF- FINAL THOUGHTS FROM OUR PANELISTS. COMMISSIONER DOUGLAS THANK YOU. I THINK WE'RE ALL WAITING TO SEE WHO SHOULD GO FIRST. THEY HAVE TWO THINGS FOR YOU IF I COULD. ONE IS I GOT BACK THE MORE SPECIFIC RESPONSE TO THE QUESTION OF HOW MUCH POTENTIAL IS IN THE SALTON SEA. THE PRODUCT UNDER THE SOLVENCY. I SAID A LOT BECAUSE IN MY MIND I SIMPLIFY IT BUT I DID GET SOME NUMBERS BACK FROM OUR STAFF SO. ACCORDING TO ENROLL THERE IS AN INFERRED POTENTIAL OF FIFTEEN MILLION METRIC TONS OF LITHIUM CARBONTE EQUIVALENT FOR THE TOTAL RESOURCE. ATTENTIONAL PRODUCTION IS ESTIMATED AT SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND METRIC TONS OF LITHIUM CARBONATE EQUIVALENT PER YEAR WHICH IS EIGHT TIMES THE TWENTY NINETEEN GLOBAL PRODUCTION OF LITHIUM. ARE EVEN IF YOU JUST TAKE THE THREE COMPANIES THAT ARE CURRENTLY. PROPOSING LITHIUM IN THE REGION YOU CAN GET UP TO A NUMBER WHEN YOU LOOK AT ALL OF THE COMBINED PROPOSALS YOU GET UP TO A NUMBER THAT COULD BE. NEARLY TWICE TWENTY NINETEEN GLOBAL PRODUCTION SO I YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW THAT ANY OF THOSE NUMBERS ARE PERFECT THEY'RE CERTAINLY NOT BUT THAT'S WHERE I STARTED WITH IT'S A LOT. YOU CAN MAKE A REAL DENT IN. WORLD WITH THE ON DEMAND IT'S REALLY UP TO US AND CAN WE GET THE INDUSTRY. OFF THE GROUND AND HOW QUICKLY WE STILL AND CAN WE DO IT IN A WAY THAT IS- IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE COMMUNITY DIALOGUES IN IN THE- OUT REGION AND WORK THAT'S CURRENTLY UNDERWAY AND- IN A WAY THAT IT RAISES. THE REGION OFTEN PROVIDES REAL OPPORTUNITIES NOT ONLY. IN IMPERIAL COUNTY IN THE SALTON SEA REGION BUT- MORE BROADLY ACROSS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND- I'M ALSO. AWARE OF IN TRACKING AND AS I MENTIONED IS THAT IT. OF THE ONE FACILITY THE ONE LINE THAT'S NOW PRODUCING LITHIUM FROM. TAILINGS AND BORON- YOU KNOW THE USE THIS IS A IT'S A DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGY IT'S A DIFFERENT LOCATION BUT IT'S NOT THAT FAR AND IT ABSOLUTELY. HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BENEFIT FROM THIS BROADER LITHIUM. ECO SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE HERE SO I JUST WANT TO SAY IN CLOSING YOU KNOW- I'M SPENDING QUITE A BIT OF TIME AND PRIORITIZING THE SUFFERS SO IS OUR CHAIR DAVID HOPE SHIELD AT THE ENERGY COMMISSION AND- YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE VERY SUPPORTIVE AND WANT TO BE. AS HELPFUL AS WE CAN AND- I THINK WITHOUT ALL ALL STOP AND I JUST APPRECIATE THE CHANCE TO BE HERE TODAY THANK YOU SO MUCH SHOP FOR ADDING TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF- VALUE TO TODAY'S. A HEARING A DOCTOR. SO LET ME PICK UP WOOD CAL LEFT OFF YOU KNOW. FAST FORWARD TO THIRTY YEARS FROM NOW. WE WILL LOOK BACK AND SAY. BACK IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE CLEARLY A WATERSHED MOMENT. WHETHER YOU TALK ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE THAT GAVE THE NOBEL PRIZE YESTERDAY FOR THE FOLKS WHO PREDICTED ALL OF THE STUFF ALL WHO. MODELED EVERYTHING. WE HAVE. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHICH IS VERY MUCH IN SYNC WITH DOES THIS PRESIDENT IS VERY COMMITTED TO COMBATING CROSS. CLIMATE CHANGE OR WHETHER YOU LOOK AT JOBS BEING CREATED IN THIS COUNTRY WE HAVE BEEN ADDED TO ANYBODY TRACKING JOBS IN THIS COUNTRY. AND WE NEED TO DO BUT SO THIRTY YEARS FROM NOW WE WILL LOOK BACK INTO. WE DID A FANTASTIC JOB OF CREATING THOSE LOOKING TO KIND OF BE IN CALIFORNIA. THAT INCLUDES THE GEO THERMAL APPROACHES SITTING TOWARDS OTHER APPROACHES THE MARKET IS SO BIG GLOBALLY BUT IT HAS ROOM FOR EVERY APPROACH THAT WE CAN TAKE OFF. I THINK WE SHOULD MAKE IT IN THE STATE INVENTED IN THE STATE AND SOUTHERN WARD WHITE. THAT'S WHAT WE SHOULD BE RESPONDING TO THIRTY YEARS FROM NOW WE SHOULD NOT BE ST COLLIE WITH MISSED AN OPTION. SO I HOPE WE GRABBED THIS. BY THE HORNS AND GO AFTER IT AND MAKE SOMETHING GREAT HAPPENED FOR CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU DR WE HEAR THE MESSAGE LOUD AND CLEAR- STEVEN BOYD. YES THANK YOU NO FURTHER COMMENTS FOR ME BUT- IT IS INSPIRING TO HEAR- THE EXCITEMENT AND- THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU SIR DANIEL OF HIS SHOW. I'M TOO MANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OTHER I DO APPRECIATE THAT HAVING THIS. AT THAT THE SMALL BUSINESS TOWN CENTRE I THINK IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE LOOK AT WAYS TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT. ON GOING YOU KNOW ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INNOVATION COME FROM THE COMMUNITY AND TO BE ABLE TO HAVE ORPHALI SOME ADDITIONAL GRANT FUNDS THAT YOU KNOW **** HAD THE PAST FOR SOME OF THE CLEANTECHNICA SHE'S THE KALKA ENERGY COMMISSION. SEATS UP I THINK THANK SIR TALK TURNS. YEAH WOULD JUST ECHO THE THIS IS A TERM. UP AND THAT WE HAVE TO BE REALLY INTENTIONAL TO MAKE SURE THAT THE JOBS PARTICULARLY FOR BLUE COLLAR WORKERS. ARE GOOD JOBS WE HAVE THE TOOLS WE HAVE TRIED AND TRUE. OF POLICY TOOLS THAT CAN COMPLEMENT- THE OTHER FORMS OF GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE AND I THINK WILL MAKE US MORE COMPETITIVE THERE'S ALWAYS THE FEAR THAT IT'S GREATER COSTS BUT- BUT WE CAN. BUILD A BLUE COLLAR WORKFORCE THAT IS REALLY WHAT REWARDED FOR THEIR WORK AND HAS THE SKILLS TO BUILD A SUSTAINABLE INDUSTRY. THANK YOU THANK YOU AND- AT LAST NOT LEAST- MISTER MACHINE VENDING MACHINES. AREN'T JUST SOME YOU KNOW I WANNA THANK ALL OF YOU AGAIN FOR ALLOWING US TO BE HERE- BUT AGAIN THIS IS WHAT MAKES OUR- OUR UNION MOM BETTER IS THAT. AS TECHNOLOGY CHANGES AND THE WAY.

GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME SELENA I'M FROM SUTTER COUNTY- I JUST WANT TO TOUCH ALONG THE LINES OF WHAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER SNIFFER THING. OF A WHOLE LOT OF THE SPEAKING TODAY THE PRESENTATIONS WERE ON A LOCAL LEVEL AS OPPOSED TO CALIFORNIA AS A WHOLE- SO I'M ACTUALLY LIVE IN A FARMING COMMUNITY- WE DEPEND A LOT ON. GAS POWERED- EQUIPMENT FOR FARM WORK AND- NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE LYCIUM CAN BE CATASTROPHIC TO WATER SOURCES. ALSO I DIDN'T HEAR A LOT ABOUTTHE HEARD IN BETWEEN THUS FOR SOURCING JOBS FOR COMMUNITY. BUT WHAT ABOUT THE END OF THE PROJECT SO FROM THE NINETEEN WHAT THAT INTEL'S AS FAR AS THE ENVIRONMENT ALSO AT THE END OF THE LINE WHAT HAPPENS AS FAR AS DISPOSAL- TAKING CARE NAY ENVIRONMENTALLY ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF THE LOOKING. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS THOSE ARE GOOD COMMENTS AND I'LL ASK OUR TEAM AND THE COMMISSIONERS I THINK THERE IS A LOT OF INTERESTS AND US HAVING. A CONVERSATION IN TERMS OF WHAT HAPPENS AT THE END OF THE LIFE OF THE BATTERY AND IN ORDER FOR US TO REALLY TAKE THIS ON COMPREHENSIVELY. THAT IS A CONVERSATION THAT WE NEED TO DIVE INTO AS WELL AND- AND THIS IS. CLEARLY A STATE WIDE OPPORTUNITY GIVEN THE- OTHER. RESOURCES AVAILABLE MINERALS AVAILABLE OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE- THAT WE TOO WOULD LIKE TO ENGAGE INTO THAT DISCUSSION AND AS YOU HEARD COMMISSIONER DOUGLAS FROM THE CC THERE FAMILIAR. WITH WHAT'S HAPPENING IN OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE- AND SO WE APPRECIATE THAT OPPORTUNITY TO KIND OF. BRING THAT ALL TOGETHER- SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS TO ANYONE ELSE WISHING TO MAKE ANY PUBLIC COMMENTS THAT- HERE WITH US TODAY. CASINO ONE IT. SHOWS THAT THIS EARLIER BUT I KNOW THAT THE COPS DRAWS ON THE NUMBER. YES AT TIM KELLER I WANT TO DRESS A COUPLE THINGS IN ONE YEAR THAT OU CATION. ABSOLUTE YOU KNOW SENDING A STATE UNIVERSITY AS A TWO HUNDRED. ACRE ON CAMPUS IN RALEIGH. AND IS WORKING ONALL. PROGRAMS CURRENTLY THEY HAVE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND SQUARE FEET SO. THE CAMPUS IN DOLLARS ACTUALLY LARGER IN THE CAMPUS AND- IN SAN DIEGO SO WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR GROWING. DAHLE DALY COLLEGE ONE OF THE FEW. COLLEGES THAT'S BEEN GROWING AND SO WE'RE WE'RE VERY COMMITTED. TO THE WORK FORCE AND- EDUCATING OUR LOCAL WORKFORCE BUT- YOU KNOW THE OLD KJRH SOLVENCY IS ONLY SIXTY MILES FROM CONTROL BALLOT. AND AND SO EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES ALSO THERE I MENTIONED- STUDIES UNIVERSITY IN MEXICO ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION PEOPLE JUST SOUTH OF THE BORDER. A WILLING TO CROSS THE BORDER AND WORK IN AND WE SEND A LOT OF STUDENTS TO MEXICO TO BE TRAINED IN. A LOT OF OUR EMPLOYEES ESPECIALLY ENGINEERING COME FROM MEXICO. SO WE'RE VERY UNIQUE SITUATION I THINK SOME OF THE QUESTIONS. THAT PEOPLE HAVE I REALLY INVITE YOU TO- YOUR CHECK UP TO UNDERSTAND. THAT NOT EVERYTHING'S THE SAME WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MONEY WITH THEM IN CARROLL COUNTY IT'S NOT LIKE MINING LITHIUM IN CHILE. ARE WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MANUFACTURING IMPERIAL COUNTY IT'S NOT LIKE MANUFACTURING AND ALEC- ONE THING WE DON'T TALK ABOUT WAS HOUSING. YOU KNOW WE ARE GROWING COMMUNITY AND- ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE ARE LOCATION THAT'S THAT'S VERY SUITABLE FOR- MANUFACTURING IS BECAUSE THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS. THE LOWEST POSSIBLE IT JUST TO BE IN THE STATE THE LOWEST COST WATER IN THE STATE AND SOME OF THE LOWEST COST HOUSING THE STATE. AND THE LOWEST COST PLAN. AND WE HAVE AN ANOMALY WHICH JUST HAPPENS TO HAVE LOOKING. SO YOU PUT ALL THIS TOGETHER IT'S- YOU KNOW IT'S A PERFECT STORM. WE NEED TO DO IT RIGHT AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE PLANTED OUT CORRECTLY WHEN YOU DO A QUICK AND THE REASON WHY. TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY FOUR IT'S HOW LONG IT'S GOING TO TAKE AT THE MINIMUM. GET THIS INDUSTRY GOING WE DON'T WANT TO PASS US BY. BECAUSE IF WE DON'T IF WE CAN'T DO IT LOCALLY IT'LL BE DONE SOMEPLACE ELSE THANK YOU THANK YOU SEE COUNTY I WAS TOLD YOU WERE GOING TO BE HERE FOR- QUESTIONS BUT I'M GLAD THAT YOU. CHIMED IN WITH YOUR CLOSING REMARKS- WE WILL CONCLUDE THIS HEARING YEAH I WANT TO THANK ALL OF THE PALACE PRESENTERS- THOSE WHO HAVE SPOKEN PUBLIC COMMENTS AND MY COLLEAGUES FOR ATTENDING.
