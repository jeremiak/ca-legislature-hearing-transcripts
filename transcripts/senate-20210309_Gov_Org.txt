BOB ONE ONE OTHER POINT- THE WHOLESALERS OFTEN HAVE CONCERNS WITH SOME OF THESE TIGHT HOUSE EXEMPTIONS AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT- WILL BE CLEAR. THE BILL HAS SPECIFIC LANGUAGE THAT MAKE SURE THAT THE WHOLESALERS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE ANY FINANCIAL SUPPORT OR COST YEAR.

GOOD AFTERNOON OR GOOD MORNING CHAIRED MEMBERS MAKING MOPAR ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE OUTDOOR ADVERTISING ASSOCIATION AND WE CURRENTLY HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION AND I WAS THE ONLY POLICY HEARING IN THE SENATE I UNDERSTAND THAT GENERALLY SPEAKING THE SENATE WOULD HEAR ISSUES RELATED TO THE OUTDOOR ADVERTISING ACT OUT THE PART OF THE BNP CODE AND SENATE TRANCE COMMITTEE BUT SINCE THE BILL WAS NOT DOUBLE REFERRED THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE TO RAISE THEIR CONCERNS HERE. GENERALLY SPEAKING THE CSO A HAVE NOT WEIGHED IN ON SITE HOUSE EXEMPTIONS THE GIVEN THE SIZE AND SCALE OF THIS EXEMPTION AND THE FACT THAT THE PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT DOES HAVE DONE ALONG STATE ROUTE FIFTY SEVEN IT RAISES MANY QUESTIONS FOR OUR MEMBERS THAT THAT CALIFORNIA HAS ENFORCED THE OUTDOOR ADVERTISING ACTIONS NINETEEN THIRTY THREE WITH FEDERAL OVERSIGHT FROM THE FEDERAL HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION- AND RECENTLY HAD TAP ON IT TOUGH QUESTIONS AND CITED CALIFORNIA SIGNS. AND PARTICULARLY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA FOR OVERSIZED WALL SCAPE AND SO OUR MEMBERS FELT LIKE WHEN THE LEGISLATURE IS CONSIDERING A LARGE INVENTION IN A DIFFERENT SECTION OF THE MP CODE IT MIGHT BE AN APPROPRIATE TIME TO REMIND DEVELOPERS AS THE FEATHER SECTION BE IN PICO TO THE OUTDOOR ADVERTISING ACT TO ENSURE THAT SIZE ZONING AND SPACING REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE. DUPLICATED BUILT IN FEDERAL AND STATE LAW ARE MAD WE UNDERSTAND THAT FROM CONVERSATIONS WITH THE SPONSORS THAT THEY DON'T BELIEVE THEY ARE SEEKING AN EXEMPTION SO OUR HOPE IS THAT THEY WOULD JUST BACK CONFIRM THAT AND LANGUAGE JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T PUT CALTRANS IN A POSITION TO BE RECEIVING FEDERAL OVERSIGHT AND AUDIT FROM THE FAD WHICH DOES THAT POTENTIALLY LEAD TO ARRESTS AGAINST TRANSPORTATION FUNDING NOTHING FORWARD. WE HOPE TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH AUTHORS AND SPONSORS- AND APPRECIATE THE EXTRA TIME TO UNDERSTAND THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT ARE YOUR COLLEAGUES IN TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE WOULD GENERALLY LOOK AT BUT AGAIN GIVEN.

AND THE HISTORY WOULD INDICATE THAT THEY USUALLY ALWAYS GET WORKED OUT SOMEWHERE ANOTHER. THERE HAVE BEEN RARE OCCASIONS WHEN THEY HAVE BEEN CONTENTIOUS BUT NOT VERY OFTEN. IN THE RECORD THAT ARE. ANALYSIS SHOWS UNTIL NINE THESE MOSTLY HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY OPPOSITION. AND THE AUTHOR IS CERTAINLY A PERSON OF THE WORD AROUND HERE COULD BE TRUSTED. AND THAT THERE IS A DYNAMIC FOR CONTINUED DISCUSSIONS AS THE BILL MOVES ALONG I HAVE A HIGH DEGREE OF CONFIDENCE THAT THE IF IT COULD BE WORKED OUT IT WILL BE AND THAT WAS DISPOSED ME TO MOVE THE BILL. HM CHEETOS COMMENTS FROM THE DEMONS THANK YOU CENTER- SIDEROXYLON.

I DATED TEN TO BE IN LINE WITH THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUES JUST NOW BUT I WILL SAY- I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR. IF IT'S AT ALL POSSIBLE THE THOUGHTS OF THE FOLKS IN THE CRAFT BREWERIES- YOU KNOW MY I UNDERSTAND THERE'S A LOT OF CONTROVERSY OVER THE- AND OVER THE OUTDOOR ADVERTISING ISSUES AND THE FEDERAL LAW AND- AND I HAD A LONG CHAT WITH MR LATIMER THIS MORNING GOT SOME OF THOSE ISSUES CLARIFIED- BUT I. BUT YOU KNOW MY PERSONAL- INTEREST IN PROTECTING THE TIED HOUSE LAWS REALLY HAS MORE TO DO WITH CONSUMER CHOICE AND ENSURING AYE I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT OUR- OUR CRAFT BREWERY. RENAISSANCE HERE INSTEAD OF CALIFORNIA HAS A LOT TO DO WITH A TIGHT HOUSE RULES AND I'D LOVE TO JUST GET A SENSE. FROM THEM AS TO WHAT THEIR CONCERNS ARE IF THAT'S AT ALL POSSIBLE I UNDERSTAND THAT THEY WERE NOT- AS- YOU KNOW. THE WANT TO MAKE SOME COMMENTS- WE'RE NOT ABLE TO BECAUSE THE PREVIOUS. OPPONENTS HAD SPOKEN BUT THE PREVIOUS GROUPS. HAVE A DIFFERENT SET OF CONCERNS WITH THIS PARTICULAR BILL THAT I WOULD THINK THE CROPPERS WOULD HAVE. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE ITS FINEST. I BELIEVE MISTER WALKER STILL ON THE LINE. SEVERAL APPRECIATE THAT THAT- SUGGESTION IF MISTER WALKER. ON THE LINE YOU TWO ARE GOING TO GET YOUR TIME. SO WHAT WE'LL DO SINCE IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE HE'S ONLINE IF HE CALLS IN WE GET DONE WITH OTHER SPEAKERS ALL ASK THE MODERATOR ONE MORE TIME WE'RE WAITING FOR A CALL FROM MR CHRIS WALKER SO NOW AT THIS POINT TIME WE'RE GOING TO TURN. TO SENATOR GLAZERS. THANK YOU SHARE DIED. AT FIRST I WANT TO SAY I APPRECIATE THE DEVELOPERS- WILLINGNESS TO INVEST IN OUR STATE- IT'S A BIG- DEVELOPMENT THAT HEY'RE TALKING ABOUT HAD A CHANCE TO TALK WITH THEM AND IT'S VERY IMPRESSIVE AND- AND I'S A BIG INVESTMENT AND I APPRECIATE. THE RISKS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THAT. BUT THE QUESTION THAT IS BEFORE US TODAY IS- IT'S MUCH BROADER THAN A STADIUM ONE OFF- AND TROUBLE THAT IT'S- IT'S VERY BROAD IN SCOPE AND THAT HAS MANY. IMPLICATIONS WAY BEYOND THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT THERE ARE OTHER- INVESTMENTS THAT HAVE OCCURRED AROUND OUR STATE LA LIVE. A NUMBER OF OTHERS. WERE YOU COULD MAKE THE SAME RATIONALE FOR THIS EXEMPTION FOR THOSE DEVELOPMENTS- THAT THAT ALREADY HAD. INVESTED IN OUR OPERATING EVEN EVEN MALL. SO I APPRECIATE HEARING THAT THE AUTHOR IS INTERESTED IN. CONTINUING THOSE DISCUSSIONS- AND THE CONCERNS HAVE BEEN RAISED ABOUT THE PRACTICE THIS. PARTICULAR PROPOSAL. AND I KNOW THAT I CENTER NUMBER TO BE EXACT A MAN OF GREAT INTEGRITY AYE. AM. NOT HEARTENED BY HIS COMMITMENT. TO TRY TO WORK THIS IS OUT IT'S LIKE THERE'S ENOUGH TO MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD OUT OF COMMITTEE TODAY I'M GOING TO. STAY OFF ON IT AND HOPE THAT- THAT THAT WORK IN THOSE COMPROMISES SAID THAT NEARLY COULD OCCUR. I WOULD HOPE THAT I CAN SUPPORT ON THE SENATE FLOOR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU SENATOR GLAZERS CENTER RUBIO. NO OKAY AT THE CENTER JONES THEN SERVER MODELS. THANK YOU CHAIR AT THE- ONE OF THE SPEAKERS MAKE IT THERE MIGHT CENTER POLICE. ONE OF THE SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION WAS OUR OUTDOOR ADVERTISING ASSOCIATION AND- IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM IT SEEMS LIKE THERE AMENDMENT OR THE- NEGOTIATIONS ARE ASKING FOR PRETTY SIMPLE I WAS WONDERING IF THE- AUTHOR OR THE SPONSORS COULD. SPEAK TO THAT AND- YOU KNOW LET US MAYBE GIVE US AN UPDATE ON THOSE CONVERSATIONS.

SENATE ALLEN YEAH I THINK THAT THOSE THOSE CONCERNS ARE AT THE HEART OF MY CONCERN HERE IT'S YOU KNOW I WAS GOING THROUGH ALL OF THE- PREVIOUS BILLS MENTION THE ANALYSIS THAT ARE RELATING TO THIS. TOPIC AND IT SEEMS AS THOUGH TO A T. IT'S ALWAYS BEEN. AN EXEMPTION SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO AN ARENA OR STADIUM- SOME LIVE. ENTERTAINMENT FACILITY AND WHILE THIS IS CERTAINLYTIED TO THE HONDA CENTER. AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THE SIGNIFICANT LIVE ENTERTAINMENT ASPECTS OF THIS PROJECT. AS WAS MENTIONED IT'S ALSO A BROADER MIXED USE PROJECT WITH RETAIL AND COMMERCIAL SPACE IN. OFFICE BUILDINGS AND MIXED INCOME ON HOUSING IN. A NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS SO. YOU KNOW ANYWAY AND I HEAR THAT THIS IS THIS IS THE WAY THE FUTURE WE'RE GONNA HAVE MORE THESE KIND OF PROJECTS I ACTUALLY THINK THIS IS A MUCH MORE APPEALING PROJECT TO HAVE AROUND THE STADIUM THAN. THAN WE HAD IN THE PAST WHERE YOU THROW STADIUM WAY OUT- IN IN THE IN THE- IN THE IN THE- PERIPHERY OF THE CITY AND PUT IN A HUGE PARKING LOT AND LET PEOPLE DRIVE THERE AND HAVE NO LOCAL LIFE. I APPRECIATE THIS KIND OF PROJECT AND APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT THIS KIND OF PROJECT IS LARGELY FINANCED. THROUGH MANY MANY MECHANISMS BUT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE FINANCING SO I UNDERSTAND THAT AND- I'D LIKE. MY SENTIMENT IS TO TRY TO. GIVE THE- AUTHORITY TO WORK ON SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED BUT I DO HAVE. I DO I DO WANT TO JUST STATE MY PHILOSOPHICAL CONCERN I'D LOVE TO HEAR. AUTHOR'S THOUGHTS ON THIS ABOUT. IT IS REALLY IS THE WAY THE FUTURE OF FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS- YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT WHAT IS THIS WHERE WHERE WHERE DO WE DRAW THE LINE I MEAN DO WE THE PROJECTS HAVE TO BE ATTACHED TO A STADIUM IN ORDER TO. GET THIS TYPE HOUSE EXEMPTION IN THEFUTURE. AND IS AGAIN- OF YOU KNOW IS IT DOES HAVE TO BE A BILL THAT'S THE PROJECT IT'S LARGE ENOUGH TO ATTRACT ATTENTION FROM. SACRAMENTO INTEREST SERVICE MEMBERS LEGISLATURE HOW HOW HOW SHOULD WE BE. OUR THINKING PHILOSOPHICALLY ABOUT A BILL LIKE THIS- WHICH ISN'T IT WHICH FROM MY PERSPECTIVE AND HIGHLY REASONABLE IN AND OF ITSELF. BUT I THINK THAT THE PRIMARY CONCERN YOU'RE HEARING IS THE- THE PRESIDENT MAY SET AND HOW SHOULD WE THINK ABOUT THIS FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE- CENTER OPERATIVE IF. TO CHECK. CEREBRAL SURE- THANK YOU MISTER AND CENTER OUT- GREAT QUESTION. HOWEVER WE'RE WE'RE DEALING WITH WITH ONE DEVELOPMENT ONE PROJECT AND I SUPPOSE THAT THE ANSWER IS THAT IS EACH PROJECT COMES BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE WE HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION AS TO HOW BROAD THE EXEMPTIONS IS GOING TO BE IN THIS CASE- IT IS. THE ANCHOR. TEN AND SO TO SPEAK IS THE IS THE HONDA CENTER. AND THIS IS THE DEVELOPMENT JUST AROUND THE HONDA CENTER. NOW IN THE FUTURE IF IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING TO BE MUCH MUCH BROADER THAN THIS. WE CAN WE CAN WE CAN VOTE NOW AT THAT POINT IN TIME. RIGHT NOW I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY WHAT LINE WE WITHDRAW EXCEPT TO LOOK AT THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT AND SAY DOES THIS MEET OUR PHILOSOPHIC. SORT OF CRITERIA AND ADDS TO THE CRAFT BREWERS. ORTON IN STRING CALIFORNIA VERY IMPORTANT IS IN CALIFORNIA WE WANT TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY CONTINUE TO THRIVE. OF MR LATIMER'S HERE I THINK HE'S UPSTAIRS. IF HE HAS ANY IDEA TO BE HAPPY TO HEAR WHAT HE HAS TO SAY. YEAH THAT'S A LOT OF OUR PLEASE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN- TO THE QUESTION FROM CENTER AROUND FOR SHE DOES WELL- CERTAINLY THIS BILL PROVIDES AN EXEMPTION AS AS CENTER BURKE SAID IT BUILDS ON A CURRENT EXEMPTION. AT THE HONDA CENTER ALREADY HAS. SO THIS IS NOT A NEW TOOL IF YOU WILL TO THE TO THE SAME VOTE YOU'RE GONNA OPERATE O. C. BY DEVELOPMENT THERE ALL THEY HAVE HAD A- TIED HOUSE EXEMPTION AT THE HONDA CENTER FOR MANY YEARS. AND URBAN NO COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE WAY ATTACHED TO THE USE OF THAT TIME HOUSE EXEMPTION INCLUDING FROM CRAFT BREWERS. WHO WE SELL THEIR PRODUCTS IN THE HONDA CENTER AND WE CERTAINLY WOULD BE SELLING THEIR PRODUCT. WITHIN THE OTHER LARGER DEVELOPMENT. THESE ARE TOOLS THAT RETAILERS AND MANUFACTURERS USED TOGETHER. SO I APPRECIATE THAT EACH ONE OF THESE HAS TO BE LOOKED AT BUT I DO DISTINCT FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE YOU STILL COME BACK TO IN THE CASE THIS PROJECT. WE HAVE THE HONDA CENTER ENTERTAINMENT CENTER. THE PROJECT HAS A SIX THOUSAND SEAT- A CONCERT HALL IN A. TWO THOUSAND SEAT AMPHITHEATER. ALL LOT OF INNER TEAM IN THERE IN THIS. WAY YOU WOULD FIND IN A- TO. LIKE A STADIUM OR ARENA SO AGAIN WE THINK IT MEETS THE PREVIOUS TEST. BUT ALSO SAY TO THE POINT OF EARLY LIFE EARLY LIFE HAS ONE OF THESE TITLES EXEMPTIONS AS WELL. WE ARE STARTING TO SEE A DIFFERENT CHANGE AND DEVELOPMENT IN EACH ONE OF THESE WILL BE HAVE TO BE LOOKED AT BUT AGAIN IN THE CASE OF THIS ONE ARE OWNERS HAVE ALREADY BEEN UTILIZING TIGHT HOUSE EXEMPTION UTILIZING RESPONSIBLY. AND EXPANDING IT TO THIS DEVELOPMENT WE THINK MAKES GOOD SENSE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. SEE NO OTHER COMMENTS- CENTER ALLEN I- I THINK IT'S PROBABLY- BODES WELL FOR A INFORMATIONAL HEARING.

THANK YOU ARE CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT SENATE BILL FOR THIRTY A BILL THAT WOULD HELP SMALL BUSINESSES BY CREATING A PROCESS BY WHICH STATE AGENCIES CAN ESTABLISH PROCEDURES FOR THE REDUCTION OF CIVIL PENALTIES UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. THIS BILL CLOSELY RESEMBLES FOURTEEN FIFTY SEVEN WHICH LAST YEAR PASSED OUT OF THE SENATE UNANIMOUSLY BUT UNFORTUNATELY WAS STALLED BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC. ANY SMALL BUSINESSES DO NOT HAVE THE SAME ORGANIZATIONAL RESOURCES AVAILABLE AS LARGER COMPANIES DO SUCH AS HAVING LEGAL DEPARTMENTS AND COMPLIANCE DEPARTMENT. THIS GONNA FORTUNATELY RESULT IN A VERY REAL OPPORTUNITY IMBALANCE BETWEEN LARGE CORPORATIONS. AND SMALL MOM AND POPS TRYING TO SURVIVE IN CALIFORNIA. MODELED AFTER THE SMALL BUSINESS REGULATORY ENFORCEMENT ACT PASSED BY CONGRESS IN THE NINETIES SB FORTY DOES NOT. LESSEN REGULATORY STANDARDS OR REDUCE THE RULE MAKING AUTHORITY OF THE STATE AGENCIES BUT INSTEAD SEEKS TO PREVENT PENALTIES FOR MINOR INFRACTIONS FROM LEADING TO FINANCIAL RUIN. UNDER THIS BILL SMALL BUSINESSES ARE REQUIRED TO MEET CERTAIN CRITERIA TO QUALIFY FOR PENALTY REDUCTIONS. INCLUDING THAT THE VIOLATION DID NOT INVOLVE WILLFUL OR CRIMINAL CONDUCT HE DID NOT POSE A SERIOUS HEALTH SAFETY OR ENVIRONMENTAL THREAT. SB FOUR THREE ALSO PROVIDES FACTORS FOR STATE AGENCIES TO CONSIDER IF AND TO WHAT EXTENT THE PENALTY SHOULD BE REDUCED WHICH INCLUDE THE DEGREE TO WHICH SMALL BUSINESS COOPERATED DURING ANY INVESTIGATION. ENGAGE IN SUBSEQUENT ACTION TO CORRECT THE VIOLATION PRIOR HISTORY OF MEETING REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. IF THE PENALTY WOULD IMPEDE THE SMALL BUSINESSES FROM CONTINUING TO OPERATE AND IF THE ACTIONS WERE NEGLIGENT. STATE AGENCIES WOULD BE ARE AUTHORIZED TO APPLY CONDITIONS TO THE REDUCTION OF PENALTIES INCLUDING REQUIRING THE SMALL BUSINESS TAKE CORRECTIVE ACTION OR TEN SPOTS SPECIFIED TRAINING. THOUSANDS OF SMALL BUSINESSES HAVE SHUTTERED THEIR DOORS DURING THE COPA NINETEEN PANDEMIC AND MANY MORE WILL FOLLOW. NOW MORE THAN EVER CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO TAKE INSTITUTIONAL ACTION TO PROVIDE REGULATORY FINANCIAL RELIEF TO SMALL BUSINESSES THAT ARE A VITAL PART OF OUR COMMUNITY. RIGHT ORGANIZING THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF OUR COMMUNITY WHILE ALSO SUPPORTING MEASURES THAT RESPONSIBLY AND SUSTAINABLY STRENGTHEN OUR ECONOMY IS A RESPONSIBILITY WE HAVE AS A LEGISLATIVE BODY.

CALIFORNIA'S COMPOUND LOCATED REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT. GIVEN OUR CURRENT ECONOMY THE LEGISLATURE HAS A TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY TO SIGNIFICANTLY BENEFIT ALL SMALL BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA- MANY BUSINESSES AND HAVE HAD TO CLOSE THEIR DOORS AND THOSE THAT DO REMAIN OPEN AND ARE LOOKING FOR THE STATE TO BE A PARTNER IN THEIR SUCCESS.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS IMAGE TIGER WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO THE BLL WELL WE'RE DEFINITELY SYMPATHETIC TO THE STRUGGLES WITH SMALL BUSINESSES ARE FACING AND I THINK THEY'RE ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT WAYS WE CAN EXPLORE HELPING THEM DEAL WITH THE STRUGGLES WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT EATING THE PENALTIES FOR SOME OF WHAT ARE OFTEN VERY SERIOUS HEALTH AND SAFETY VIOLATIONS IS THE WAY TO GO- THERE THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT ISSUES WITH THE SPELL THE FIRST WOULD BE THAT- WE DO THINK ONE HUNDRED EMPLOYEES IS ACTUALLY A PRETTY SMALL BUSINESS AND THAT. ARE SORRY A PRETTY LARGE BUSINESS AND THAT AT THAT LEVEL THEY'RE ALL SORTS OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR RESOURCES THERE TO HELP EMPLOYERS COMPLY WITH THE LAW AND ESPECIALLY WITH RESPECT TO WORKER HEALTH AND SAFETY WHAT'S IN THIS BILL KIND OF LOOKS A LOT LIKE WHAT'S ALREADY IN REGULATIONS RIGHT NOW AND ACTUALLY DOES BRING ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES TO THE ISSUE OF WORKER HEALTH AND SAFETY WHERE. IT LEADS TO A LOT OF LITIGATION THAT THEN LEADS TO A LOT OF DIFFERENT- DELAYS IN THE PROCESS OF THAT TRANSLATE TO EMPLOYERS BASICALLY GETTING ALREADY MUCH SMALLER PENALTIES THAT CREATE A MUCH WEAKER DISINCENTIVE AGAINST A LOT OF THE VIOLATIONS THAT HAVE INJURED AND FRANKLY KILLED A LOT OF WORKERS THAT. WE UNDERSTAND IT'S TOUGH TO KEEP IN MIND ALL THESE DIFFERENT REGULATIONS AND WE DEFINITELY ARE INTERESTED IN ANYWAY IT'S TO HELP EMPLOYERS COMPLY THINGS LIKE A CONSULTATION UNIT THE CALLOUS OFFERS WHEREVER WE CAN EXPAND THAT MODEL OTHER REGULATORY AGENCIES WILL DEFINITELY OPEN TO THOSE TYPES OF DISCUSSIONS BUT THAT JUST. LOWERING THE PENALTY IS JUST KIND OF BY DEFINITION LOWERS THE DISINCENTIVES AGAINST.

WHO'S ATKINS REMOVED A CENTER WILL MOVES- CENTER BORDERS WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE- THE COMMENTS HE THAT- FOLKS HAVE MADE CALLING IN BOTH IN SUPPORT. AND OFFERING SOME CRITICISM I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT SOMETHING THAT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE RECORD TO MEMORIALIZE- IN THE OFFICE IN THE ONE OPPOSITION LETTER- I THINK THERE MIGHT BE SOME CONFUSION I'M GOING TO QUOTE. IS ON BEHALF OF THE- OPPONENT. THE OPPOSITION SB FORTY IDENTIFIES THAT SB FORTY WOULD ALLOW BUSINESSES TO EVADE PENALTIES FOR VIOLATING HEALTH SAFETY OR ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS OR STATUTES. THAT FLIES DIRECTLY CONTRARY TO THE LANGUAGE OF THE BILL UNFORTUNATELY- AND I'LL IDENTIFY THE VIOLATIONS THAT UNDER THIS BILL SMALL BUSINESS ARE REQUIRED TO MEET CERTAIN CRITERIA TO QUALIFY FOR PENALTY REDUCTION. ON THE CONDITION THAT THE VIOLATION DID NOT INVOLVE WILL FOR CRIMINAL CONDUCT AND DID NOT POSE A SERIOUS HEALTH SAFETY OR ENVIRONMENTAL THREAT SO I THINK THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN SOME- CONFUSION ON. THE LANGUAGE OF THE BILL AND I'M GLAD THEY WERE ABLE TO CLARIFY THAT HOPEFULLY THOSE FOLKS WOULD BE ABLE TO- COME ON BOARD TO BE SUPPORTIVE ALL AND WITH AN EXAMPLE HERE. THIS IS A FOR A LITTLE WHILE BACK THERE WAS A RESTAURANT OWNER IN VACAVILLE CALIFORNIA BELIEVE IT WAS. AN HISPANIC WOMAN OWNED A RESTAURANT. SHE WAS FINED FORTY OVER FOURTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER VIOLATIONS THAT SHE WAS UNAWARE OF AT THE TIME. ONE OF THE VIOLATIONS IN PARTICULAR WAS FOR THE LACK OF A PLUG FOR AN OUTLET. THE VIOLATION ALONE WAS BETWEEN A THOUSAND AND TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR A TWENTY FIVE CENT FIX. IF THIS POLICY WAS IN PLACE THE AGENCY COULD HAVE WORK WITH THE RESTAURANT OWNER AND GIVEN HER THE CHANCE TO CORRECT THE VIOLATION. AND OR EITHER REDUCE HER PENALTY. COVERT HAS TAUGHT US A LOT OF THINGS ONE IN PARTICULAR IS THAT GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO BE MORE HUMAN. WE HAVE TO MAKE OURSELVES AVAILABLE IN AVAIL OURSELVES OF THE VERY PURPOSE FOR WHICH WE EXIST. AND THAT IS TO ALLOW FOR THE FOR THE FUNCTIONING OF OUR COMMUNITY. AND BEING A PARTNER LOOKING AFTER PUBLICSAFETY BUT ALSO BEING A PARTNER TO THE ECONOMIC. ENGINES OF OUR ECONOMY ESPECIALLY DURING THIS TIME COLLEAGUES I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST BY YOUR SUPPORT FOR US BEFORE THIRTY BECAUSE THIS IS HOW WE MAKE GOVERNMENT. MORE HUMAN AND CAN ALLOW FOR.

OF YOU KNOW OF THE INDUSTRY PUTTING FOOD ON OUR TABLES AND I THINK IT'S LONG OVERDUE THAT WE RECOGNIZE SOME FOR WHAT THEY ARE ESSENTIAL. TO THIS COUNTRY. MY FATHER CAME OVER TO THIS COUNTRY WITH AN OPEN INVITATION TO JOIN THEM BUT I SETTLE PROGRAM. BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE WORKFORCE. AND TYPICALLY FROM MARKETS TO THE JOBS THAT MOST PEOPLE WOULDN'T EVEN CONSIDER.

NINE TWO NINE EIGHT ALLOWS THE OWNER OF A BREWPUB RESTAURANT LICENSE ALSO KNOWN AS A TYPE SEVENTY FIVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXCHANGE THAT LICENSE FOR ALCOHOL RESTAURANT LICENSE OR TYPE FORTY SEVEN LICENSE. AS MOST OF YOU ARE AWARE OF THE BREW PUB RESTAURANT LICENSE ALLOWS THE LICENSEES THE ABILITY TO OPERATE A RESTAURANT IT ALSO REQUIRES LICENSEE TO BROUGH A MINIMUM OF A HUNDRED BARRELS PER YEAR APPEAR. SOME BELIEVE THAT MANY ORDERS A BREWPUB RESTAURANT LICENSES ARE SIMPLY BRING THE MINIMUM AMOUNT OF BEER IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH A RESTAURANT LICENSE. THIS IS PROVED TO BE CONFUSING AND FRUSTRATING THE LICENSE HOLDERS I HAVE WITNESSED FIRST HAND IN MY OWN DISTRICT. BECAUSE OF LACK OF RESTAURANT LICENSES AT NAPA COUNTY AND OTHER AREAS A NUMBER OF RESTAURANT OWNERS HAVE OTAINED. A BREWPUB RESTAURANT LICENSE IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO OPEN UP A RESTAURANT WHILE THEY'RE IN FULL COMPLIANCE WITH STATE LAW. THE HUNDRED BARREL BREWING REQUIREMENT HAS NONETHELESS CREATED FRUSTRATION FOR EVERYBODY INVOLVED. INCLUDING REALLY CRAFT BREW MAKERS- THE PERHAPS DON'T THINK THAT THE QUALITY OF FEES BRUISER PARTICULARLY GOOD- IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN SENATOR BRADFORD'S AT S. B. TWELVE EIGHTY THREE. INSURED THAT A HOLDER OF A BREWPUB RESTAURANT LICENSE WOULD NOT USE THIS LICENSE SIMPLY OPEN TO OPEN UP A RESTAURANT WITHOUT. HAVING AN INTEREST IN BREWING BEER. AT FORTY THEY'RE A NUMBER OF LICENSES THAT OBTAINED THEIR LICENSE PRIOR TO THE CHANGES MADE BY S. B. TWELVE EIGHTY THREE THAT HAVE NO INTEREST IN BREWING BEER. AND ARE SIMPLY FOR FILLING THAT REQUIREMENT IN ORDER TO REMAIN COMPLIANT WITH STATE LAW. IT'S MY STRONG BELIEF THAT HAVING THESE LICENSES OPERATE UNDER A BREWPUB RESTAURANT LICENSE RATHER THAN ALCOHOL RESTAURANT LICENSE MAKES LITTLE SENSE. NOT ONLY ARE THESE LICENSES REQUIRED TO WASTE VALUABLE TIME AND RESOURCES IN BREWERY BEER THEY HAVE LITTLE INTEREST IN BREWING. BUT THE DEPARTMENT ABC IS WASTING VALUABLE RESOURCES ENSURING THAT THEY MAY- THAT THEY'RE KEEPING IN COMPLIANCE WITH STATE LAW. MY BILL SB TWO NINE EIGHT WOULD ALLOW THESE LICENSES THE ABILITY TO EXCHANGE OUR LICENSE FOR ALCOHOL RESTAURANT LICENSE THIS CHANGE MIRRORS A PROVISION IN STATE LAW WHICH ALLOWS LICENSEES OF AN ALCOHOL RESTAURANT. LICENSE TO EXCHANGE OUR LICENSE FOR A BAR. A LICE'S AND VICE VERSA THE AMENDMENTS ACCEPTED TODAY AMONG OTHER THINGS REQUIRE THESE LICENSES TO PAY THE SAME AMOUNT FOR NOW CALL RESTAURANT LICENSES ANY OTHER APPLICANT. THE MINUTE ALSO PROHIBITS HE'S LICENSE FROM BEING SOLD FOR PROFIT ON THE OPEN MARKET. I BELIEVE THIS BILL AS A FAIR COMPROMISE IT ALLOWS BUSINESSES WHO HAVE INVESTED HEAVILY IN OUR COMMUNITIES THE ABILITY TO FINALLY OPERATE UNDER THE APPROPRIATE LICENSE WHILE ALSO ENSURING THAT THEY DO NOT PROFIT FROM THE SALE OF THEIR ALCOHOL RESTAURANT LICENSE IN THE FUTURE. IT I THRIVE OF. I'D THANK YOU. AND DO WE HAVE ANY OF THE TO THE AMENDMENTS THE AUTHOR ACCEPTS THAT AUTHORED AMENDMENTS NOT THERE THERE WILL BE THEN ADOPTED DO WE HAVE ANY SUPPORT HERE IN Q.
