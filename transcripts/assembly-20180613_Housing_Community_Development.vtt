WANT TO THANK? STAFF FOR THE

00:29:32.271 --> 00:29:34.640 region:rollup2
ANALYSIS WHICH POINTS OUT THAT

00:29:33.138 --> 00:29:36.575 region:rollup2
THIS.

00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:38.110 region:rollup2
NO IS IT IS NOT. ANYTHING

00:29:36.575 --> 00:29:40.479 region:rollup2
ENTIRELY NEW.

00:29:38.110 --> 00:29:42.014 region:rollup2
THIS IS DONE AND THERE IS IT'S

00:29:40.479 --> 00:29:43.181 region:rollup2
DONE IN MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS

00:29:42.014 --> 00:29:44.683 region:rollup2
NOTHING I WOULD LIKE TO POINT

00:29:43.181 --> 00:29:46.785 region:rollup2
OUT IS THAT.

00:29:44.683 --> 00:29:47.886 region:rollup2
THE. ELECTION PROCESS IN THE

00:29:46.785 --> 00:29:49.788 region:rollup2
DAVIS STIRLING ACT IS VERY

00:29:47.886 --> 00:29:51.590 region:rollup2
COMPREHENSIVE.

00:29:49.788 --> 00:29:54.226 region:rollup2
I'M AND ONE THING IS THAT THERE

00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:57.062 region:rollup2
NEEDS TO BE A CERTAIN QUORUM OF

00:29:54.226 --> 00:29:58.797 region:rollup2
BALLOTS THAT A RETURN BEFORE.

00:29:57.062 --> 00:30:00.098 region:rollup2
THEY CAN ACTUALLY BE COUNTED.

00:29:58.797 --> 00:30:02.200 region:rollup2
THERE ARE A NUMBER F SITUATIONS

00:30:00.098 --> 00:30:03.502 region:rollup2
WHERE THAT QUORUM IS NOT REACHED

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:05.203 region:rollup2
SO IN THE SITUATION THAT WE'RE

00:30:03.502 --> 00:30:07.205 region:rollup2
WE'RE HAVING HERE IS IT YOU MAY

00:30:05.203 --> 00:30:10.575 region:rollup2
HAVE MEMBERS THAT ARE ACTUALLY

00:30:07.205 --> 00:30:11.176 region:rollup2
WANTING TO BE. A BOARD MEMBERS

00:30:10.575 --> 00:30:12.010 region:rollup2
AND RUNNING FOR THE BOARD OF

00:30:11.176 --> 00:30:13.812 region:rollup2
DIRECTORS.

00:30:12.010 --> 00:30:15.747 region:rollup2
AND THROUGH THE EXISTING BALLOT

00:30:13.812 --> 00:30:18.083 region:rollup2
PROCESS IF THAT QUORUM MINIMUM

00:30:15.747 --> 00:30:20.319 region:rollup2
QUORUM OF RETURN BALLOTS IS NOT

00:30:18.083 --> 00:30:22.087 region:rollup2
ACHIEVED THOSE MEMBERS CANNOT.

00:30:20.319 --> 00:30:24.256 region:rollup2
BECOME BOARD MEMBERS

00:30:22.087 --> 00:30:26.591 region:rollup2
SO THIS THIS ACTUALLY DOES IN

00:30:24.256 --> 00:30:28.226 region:rollup2
SOME WAYS HELP US GET NEW BOARD

00:30:26.591 --> 00:30:29.561 region:rollup2

00:30:28.226 --> 00:30:31.096 region:rollup2
WHEN THERE ARE FEWER CANDIDATES

00:30:29.561 --> 00:30:33.332 region:rollup2
THEN THERE ARE. VACANCIES OR

00:30:31.096 --> 00:30:34.566 region:rollup2
EQUAL TO NUMBER ALLOWS FOR THAT

00:30:33.332 --> 00:30:36.401 region:rollup2
TRANSITION OF LEADERSHIP TO

00:30:34.566 --> 00:30:38.270 region:rollup2

00:31:17.008 --> 00:31:18.744 region:rollup2
.

00:31:17.142 --> 00:31:19.811 region:rollup2
GOOD MORNING TO THE CHAIR AND TO

00:31:18.744 --> 00:31:22.080 region:rollup2
THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS

00:31:19.811 --> 00:31:23.882 region:rollup2
MARJORIE MURRAY. CENTER FOR

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:25.884 region:rollup2
HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATION LAW. WE

00:31:23.882 --> 00:31:27.986 region:rollup2
REPRESENT HOMEOWNERS WHO LIVE IN

00:31:25.884 --> 00:31:29.187 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S FIFTY TWO THOUSAND

00:31:27.986 --> 00:31:33.692 region:rollup2
HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATIONS.

00:31:29.187 --> 00:31:35.026 region:rollup2
.

00:31:33.692 --> 00:31:37.195 region:rollup2
FIRST I WILL SAY WHY DOES

00:31:35.026 --> 00:31:38.897 region:rollup2
ANYBODY CARE ABOUT HOMEOWNER

00:31:37.195 --> 00:31:41.333 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATION ELECTIONS.

00:31:38.897 --> 00:31:42.501 region:rollup2
FOR THE SIMPLE REASON.

00:31:41.333 --> 00:31:44.369 region:rollup2
THAT HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATIONS ARE

00:31:42.501 --> 00:31:46.138 region:rollup2
NOT COUNTRY CLUBS.

00:31:44.369 --> 00:31:48.573 region:rollup2
THERE NOT CASUAL NEIGHBORHOOD

00:31:46.138 --> 00:31:50.509 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS.

00:31:48.573 --> 00:31:52.744 region:rollup2
THAT ORGANIZE.

00:31:50.509 --> 00:31:55.313 region:rollup2
I A JULY FOURTH PICNICS.

00:31:52.744 --> 00:31:56.848 region:rollup2
THIS IS ANOTHER LEVEL OF LOCAL

00:31:55.313 --> 00:31:57.449 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT THAT HAS BEEN MADE

00:31:56.848 --> 00:32:01.086 region:rollup2
QUITE CLEAR BY THE CALIFORNIA

00:31:57.449 --> 00:32:02.788 region:rollup2
UP.

00:32:01.086 --> 00:32:04.823 region:rollup2
HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATION HAVE

00:32:02.788 --> 00:32:06.992 region:rollup2
EXTRAORDINARY POWERS.

00:32:04.823 --> 00:32:08.827 region:rollup2
OVER THE LIVES AND THE PROPERTY

00:32:06.992 --> 00:32:10.262 region:rollup2
OF PEOPLE WHO LIVE THERE AND

00:32:08.827 --> 00:32:11.997 region:rollup2
THAT POWER IS EXERCISED THROUGH

00:32:10.262 --> 00:32:13.465 region:rollup2
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

00:32:11.997 --> 00:32:15.700 region:rollup2
SO FOR THAT REASON WE ARE

00:32:13.465 --> 00:32:17.769 region:rollup2
EXTREMELY CONCERNED ABOUT THE

00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:20.272 region:rollup2
STATUTES GOVERNING HOMEOWNER

00:32:17.769 --> 00:32:23.542 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATION ELECTIONS AND ANY

00:32:20.272 --> 00:32:25.043 region:rollup2
ATTEMPTS TO ELIMINATE THEM.

00:32:23.542 --> 00:32:26.378 region:rollup2
THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT

00:32:25.043 --> 00:32:28.280 region:rollup2
THIS TOPIC HAS BEEN BROUGHT

00:32:26.378 --> 00:32:30.182 region:rollup2
FORWARD THROUGH LEGISLATION THIS

00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:31.883 region:rollup2
IS THE THIRD EFFORT.

00:32:30.182 --> 00:32:33.285 region:rollup2
THE INDUSTRY IS DETERMINED TO

00:32:31.883 --> 00:32:35.053 region:rollup2
ELIMINATE ELECTIONS AND TO

00:32:33.285 --> 00:32:36.988 region:rollup2
REPLACE THEM

00:32:35.053 --> 00:32:38.690 region:rollup2
WITH ELECTIONS BY NOT NOT EVEN

00:32:36.988 --> 00:32:39.558 region:rollup2
ELECTIONS.

00:32:38.690 --> 00:32:41.393 region:rollup2
TO SEE BOARD DIRECTORS BY

00:32:39.558 --> 00:32:42.561 region:rollup2
ACCLAMATION.

00:32:41.393 --> 00:32:44.329 region:rollup2
AND ONE OTHER DISTRESSING THINGS

00:32:42.561 --> 00:32:46.398 region:rollup2
IS IT'S.

00:32:44.329 --> 00:32:49.301 region:rollup2
HOMEOWNERS REPORT TO US THAT

00:32:46.398 --> 00:32:50.735 region:rollup2
THIS IS ALREADY TAKING PLACE.

00:32:49.301 --> 00:32:53.305 region:rollup2
BOARD DIRECTORS ARE ALREADY

00:32:50.735 --> 00:32:55.640 region:rollup2
BEING SEATED BY ACCLAMATION.

00:32:53.305 --> 00:32:58.076 region:rollup2
AND SO THESE REPEATED ATTEMPTS

00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:59.444 region:rollup2
AB LEGISLATION ARE REALLY THE

00:32:58.076 --> 00:33:01.146 region:rollup2
PETITION BY THE ASSOCIATION

00:32:59.444 --> 00:33:03.315 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY.

00:33:01.146 --> 00:33:04.616 region:rollup2
TO ASK THE LEGISLATURE TO BLESS

00:33:03.315 --> 00:33:06.618 region:rollup2
A PLAQUE PRACTICE

00:33:04.616 --> 00:33:08.420 region:rollup2
ALREADY IN PLACE.

00:33:06.618 --> 00:33:10.222 region:rollup2
SO.

00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:12.424 region:rollup2
THE UNFORTUNATE THING ABOUT THIS

00:33:10.222 --> 00:33:15.494 region:rollup2
BILL IS THAT IT COMBINES TWO

00:33:12.424 --> 00:33:17.229 region:rollup2
POWERS.

00:33:15.494 --> 00:33:19.197 region:rollup2
BOARDS ALREADY HAVE UNDER

00:33:17.229 --> 00:33:20.499 region:rollup2
EXISTING LAW THE RIGHT TO SET

00:33:19.197 --> 00:33:22.267 region:rollup2
QUALIFICATIONS FOR BOARD

00:33:20.499 --> 00:33:24.736 region:rollup2
DIRECTORS.

00:33:22.267 --> 00:33:26.338 region:rollup2
IT'S A POWER THEY ABUSE

00:33:24.736 --> 00:33:29.107 region:rollup2
HOMEOWNERS REPORT TO US THAT THE

00:33:26.338 --> 00:33:30.141 region:rollup2
QUALIFICATIONS ARE THINGS LIKE

00:33:29.107 --> 00:33:32.110 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE TO SPEAK ENGLISH I'M

00:33:30.141 --> 00:33:33.478 region:rollup2
NOT KIDDING.

00:33:32.110 --> 00:33:35.280 region:rollup2
YOU CANNOT BE DISABLED YOU

00:33:33.478 --> 00:33:37.649 region:rollup2
CANNOT BE DEAF BECAUSE WE'RE NOT

00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:39.584 region:rollup2
GOING TO HIRE A SIGN LANGUAGE

00:33:37.649 --> 00:33:41.419 region:rollup2
INTERPRETER TO TELL YOU WHAT'S

00:33:39.584 --> 00:33:42.787 region:rollup2
GOING ON AT A BOARD MEETING.

00:33:41.419 --> 00:33:45.357 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE TO BE A FULL TIME

00:33:42.787 --> 00:33:46.958 region:rollup2
RESIDENT OF THE ASSOCIATION EVEN

00:33:45.357 --> 00:33:49.127 region:rollup2
IN THOSE ASSOCIATIONS COMPRISING

00:33:46.958 --> 00:33:51.296 region:rollup2
SECOND HOMES.

00:33:49.127 --> 00:33:53.532 region:rollup2
AND MOST DISTURBING YOU CANNOT

00:33:51.296 --> 00:33:55.800 region:rollup2
EVER HAVE SUED THE ASSOCIATION

00:33:53.532 --> 00:33:57.602 region:rollup2
IN THE PREVIOUS SIX YEARS OR TEN

00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:59.604 region:rollup2
YEARS OR WHATEVER. IN OTHER

00:33:57.602 --> 00:34:01.973 region:rollup2
WORDS YOU CANNOT BE A PERSON

00:33:59.604 --> 00:34:03.675 region:rollup2
ATTEMPTING TO EXERCISE HE ARE

00:34:01.973 --> 00:34:04.943 region:rollup2
YOUR RIGHTS THROUGH THE COURTS.

00:34:03.675 --> 00:34:07.746 region:rollup2
ALL OF THIS IS EXTREMELY

00:34:04.943 --> 00:34:11.283 region:rollup2
DISTURBING TO US.

00:34:07.746 --> 00:34:14.419 region:rollup2
SO ELECTIONS IN ASSOCIATIONS ARE

00:34:11.283 --> 00:34:17.055 region:rollup2
CRITICAL BECAUSE THESE ARE SELF

00:34:14.419 --> 00:34:19.658 region:rollup2
GOVERNING ORGANISATIONS.

00:34:17.055 --> 00:34:22.627 region:rollup2
MEMBERSHIP IS MANDATORY WHEN YOU

00:34:19.658 --> 00:34:24.996 region:rollup2
BUY AN ASSOCIATION HOME YOU HAVE

00:34:22.627 --> 00:34:27.198 region:rollup2
TO BELONG TO THE ASSOCIATION.

00:34:24.996 --> 00:34:29.367 region:rollup2
AND THE BOARD.

00:34:27.198 --> 00:34:31.836 region:rollup2
EXERCISES ITS POWER

00:34:29.367 --> 00:34:34.906 region:rollup2
UNDER AUTHORITY GRANTED BY THE

00:34:31.836 --> 00:34:36.841 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE. IT ALSO CONTROLS

00:34:34.906 --> 00:34:39.411 region:rollup2
ALL THE ASSOCIATION MONEY.

00:34:36.841 --> 00:34:41.846 region:rollup2
SO WE HAVE A COMBINATION OF

00:34:39.411 --> 00:34:44.316 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY AND RESOURCES.

00:34:41.846 --> 00:34:46.151 region:rollup2
WE ONLY CHECK ON WHICH

00:34:44.316 --> 00:34:48.053 region:rollup2
IS THE VOTE.

00:34:46.151 --> 00:34:50.989 region:rollup2
AND THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO

00:34:48.053 --> 00:34:53.925 region:rollup2
REPLACE LEADERSHIP.

00:34:50.989 --> 00:34:55.327 region:rollup2
SO WE ARE EXTREMELY CONCERNED

00:34:53.925 --> 00:34:57.395 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE SPELL WE URGE THE

00:34:55.327 --> 00:35:00.265 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE.

00:34:57.395 --> 00:35:01.533 region:rollup2
TO VOTE NO ON A.

00:35:00.265 --> 00:35:03.735 region:rollup2
AND TO SEE THAT A DOES NOT

00:35:01.533 --> 00:35:05.704 region:rollup2
PROCEED THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE

00:35:03.735 --> 00:35:07.472 region:rollup2
AS THESE PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS.

00:35:05.704 --> 00:35:10.141 region:rollup2
HAVE ATTEMPTED.

00:35:07.472 --> 00:35:11.643 region:rollup2
.

00:35:10.141 --> 00:35:13.211 region:rollup2
FINALLY I WILL SAY THAT THE

00:35:11.643 --> 00:35:14.412 region:rollup2
RIGHT TO VOTE IN THE RIGHT TO

00:35:13.211 --> 00:35:17.549 region:rollup2
RUN FOR OFFICE HAS BEEN

00:35:14.412 --> 00:35:19.117 region:rollup2
CONFERRED. BY.

00:35:17.549 --> 00:35:20.318 region:rollup2
AT THE MOMENT AND THE EVENT THAT

00:35:19.117 --> 00:35:21.786 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY BUYS AN ASSOCIATION

00:35:20.318 --> 00:35:23.488 region:rollup2
HOME.

00:35:21.786 --> 00:35:25.757 region:rollup2
SO IT'S CREATED THROUGH

00:35:23.488 --> 00:35:27.292 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVE LAW. IT'S BEEN

00:35:25.757 --> 00:35:28.827 region:rollup2
ELABORATED ON BY THE LEGISLATURE

00:35:27.292 --> 00:35:30.862 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE STATUTES.

00:35:28.827 --> 00:35:32.297 region:rollup2
CREATED.

00:35:30.862 --> 00:35:33.064 region:rollup2
THROUGH A BIPARTISAN EFFORT IN

00:35:32.297 --> 00:35:34.766 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND FIVE TWO THOUSAND

00:35:33.064 --> 00:35:36.101 region:rollup2
SIX.

00:35:34.766 --> 00:35:38.103 region:rollup2
AND THESE RIGHTS HAVE BEEN

00:35:36.101 --> 00:35:39.671 region:rollup2
REAFFIRMED THROUGH THE COURTS.

00:35:38.103 --> 00:35:41.373 region:rollup2
SO WE URGE A NO VOTE ON THE

00:35:39.671 --> 00:35:43.842 region:rollup2
MEASURE.

00:35:41.373 --> 00:35:45.343 region:rollup2
S. WITNESS.

00:35:43.842 --> 00:35:46.878 region:rollup2
YES MY NAME IS TOM SIR I'M A

00:35:45.343 --> 00:35:48.446 region:rollup2
MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATIVE

00:35:46.878 --> 00:35:49.748 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE OF THE CENTER PRINT A

00:35:48.446 --> 00:35:51.282 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATION

00:35:49.748 --> 00:35:52.851 region:rollup2
LAW.

00:35:51.282 --> 00:35:55.053 region:rollup2
I'M A RETIRED SUPERIOR COURT

00:35:52.851 --> 00:35:56.855 region:rollup2
COMMISSIONER AND I DO LIVE IN A

00:35:55.053 --> 00:35:58.423 region:rollup2
LARGE A SENIOR.

00:35:56.855 --> 00:36:00.325 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY IN A COMMON INTEREST

00:35:58.423 --> 00:36:01.593 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT.

00:36:00.325 --> 00:36:04.029 region:rollup2
IN SOLANO COUNTY.

00:36:01.593 --> 00:36:06.097 region:rollup2
AND I WANT TO FIRST OF ALL

00:36:04.029 --> 00:36:07.999 region:rollup2
POINT OUT THAT.

00:36:06.097 --> 00:36:09.734 region:rollup2
THE PROVISION ON A SEATING BY

00:36:07.999 --> 00:36:12.270 region:rollup2
ACCLAMATION IS REALLY A DUAL

00:36:09.734 --> 00:36:14.005 region:rollup2
THREAT TO THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS

00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:14.372 region:rollup2
IN THIS WAY FIRST THERE'S.

00:36:14.005 --> 00:36:16.541 region:rollup2
WHAT?

00:36:14.372 --> 00:36:19.444 region:rollup2
MARJORIE IS POINTED OUT WHICH

00:36:16.541 --> 00:36:21.079 region:rollup2
IS THAT THERE ARE ONGOING ABUSES

00:36:19.444 --> 00:36:23.615 region:rollup2
OF THE EXISTING POWER TO SET

00:36:21.079 --> 00:36:26.251 region:rollup2
QUALIFICATIONS.

00:36:23.615 --> 00:36:28.186 region:rollup2
TO RUN FOR THE BOARD.

00:36:26.251 --> 00:36:29.254 region:rollup2
THIS SECOND THREAT IS THAT

00:36:28.186 --> 00:36:31.089 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE WAY THIS IS

00:36:29.254 --> 00:36:33.758 region:rollup2
DRAFTED.

00:36:31.089 --> 00:36:35.627 region:rollup2
IT IS ONE INDIVIDUAL KNOWN AS

00:36:33.758 --> 00:36:36.194 region:rollup2
THE INSPECTOR OF ELECTIONS

00:36:35.627 --> 00:36:39.464 region:rollup2
WHO LOOKING AT THE SITUATION

00:36:36.194 --> 00:36:41.633 region:rollup2
CAN.

00:36:39.464 --> 00:36:43.668 region:rollup2
UNILATERALLY DECLARE A THAT

00:36:41.633 --> 00:36:45.070 region:rollup2
THERE IS THE RIGHT NUMBER OF

00:36:43.668 --> 00:36:46.671 region:rollup2
CANDIDATES AND THEREFORE CANCEL

00:36:45.070 --> 00:36:49.307 region:rollup2
THE ELECTION.

00:36:46.671 --> 00:36:51.309 region:rollup2
THISMAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE REALLY

00:36:49.307 --> 00:36:53.278 region:rollup2
ARE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO FOR

00:36:51.309 --> 00:36:54.312 region:rollup2
ANYONE WHO DISAGREES WITH THAT

00:36:53.278 --> 00:36:56.214 region:rollup2
DECISION TO RAISE THE HEAT

00:36:54.312 --> 00:36:58.016 region:rollup2
CHALLENGE.

00:36:56.214 --> 00:37:00.085 region:rollup2
THERE'S NOTHING TO LITIGATE

00:36:58.016 --> 00:37:01.653 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO ELECTION THE STATUTES

00:37:00.085 --> 00:37:03.688 region:rollup2
ARE ALL WRITTEN IN SUCH A WAY

00:37:01.653 --> 00:37:05.390 region:rollup2
THAT MEMBERS WHO DISAGREE WITH

THERE'S NO VEHICLE AND WE WITH

WHICH TO CHALLENGE.

00:37:15.767 --> 00:37:18.970 region:rollup2
SECONDLY.

00:37:16.501 --> 00:37:20.505 region:rollup2
IN ISSUES BEEN MADE THAT AND

00:37:18.970 --> 00:37:23.842 region:rollup2
REALLY THE PRIMARY.

00:37:20.505 --> 00:37:27.045 region:rollup2
JUSTIFICATION ADVANCE FOR THE

00:37:23.842 --> 00:37:27.579 region:rollup2
THIS SITUATION FOR THIS. A BILL.

00:37:27.045 --> 00:37:29.347 region:rollup2
ISN'T THERE WILL BE A COST

00:37:27.579 --> 00:37:31.816 region:rollup2
SAVING.

00:37:29.347 --> 00:37:34.285 region:rollup2
USING THE PROPONENTS OWN

00:37:31.816 --> 00:37:35.954 region:rollup2
STATISTICS WHERE THEY SAY THAT

00:37:34.285 --> 00:37:37.789 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE SPENT SIXTY THOUSAND

00:37:35.954 --> 00:37:38.289 region:rollup2
DOLLARS A THREE ELECTIONS ABOUT

00:37:37.789 --> 00:37:40.158 region:rollup2
TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS

00:37:38.289 --> 00:37:40.959 region:rollup2
ELECTION.

00:37:40.158 --> 00:37:42.393 region:rollup2
BUT THEY ALSO HAVE EIGHTEEN

00:37:40.959 --> 00:37:44.395 region:rollup2
THOUSAND.

00:37:42.393 --> 00:37:46.331 region:rollup2
A RESIDENTS.

00:37:44.395 --> 00:37:47.632 region:rollup2
THAT WORKS OUT TO A DOLLAR

00:37:46.331 --> 00:37:48.533 region:rollup2
ELEVEN CENTS.

00:37:47.632 --> 00:37:50.835 region:rollup2
PER.

00:37:48.533 --> 00:37:53.638 region:rollup2
RESIDENT.

00:37:50.835 --> 00:37:56.441 region:rollup2
AND THAT IS A TINY COSTA P. TO

00:37:53.638 --> 00:37:58.943 region:rollup2
GUARANTEE THE RIGHT TO VOTE.

00:37:56.441 --> 00:38:01.146 region:rollup2
JUST I JUST HAVE TO NOTE THAT

00:37:58.943 --> 00:38:03.114 region:rollup2
TYPICALLY H. AWAY DUES ARE

00:38:01.146 --> 00:38:04.983 region:rollup2
SEVERAL HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH.

00:38:03.114 --> 00:38:08.553 region:rollup2
SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A TINY

00:38:04.983 --> 00:38:10.121 region:rollup2
FRACTION OF ONE MONTHS CESSPIT.

00:38:08.553 --> 00:38:12.490 region:rollup2
TO HAVE TO RETAIN THE RIGHT TO

00:38:10.121 --> 00:38:12.690 region:rollup2
VOTE AND WE BELIEVE THAT THAT'S

00:38:12.490 --> 00:38:15.193 region:rollup2
THE.

00:38:12.690 --> 00:38:16.895 region:rollup2
COST WELL WORTH PAYING.

00:38:15.193 --> 00:38:18.029 region:rollup2
ON MARJORIE'S POINT ABOUT THE

00:38:16.895 --> 00:38:19.731 region:rollup2
FACT THAT THIS IS ALREADY ON

00:38:18.029 --> 00:38:21.399 region:rollup2
GOING I HAVE TO SAY THAT IN MY

00:38:19.731 --> 00:38:22.834 region:rollup2
OWN ASSOCIATION.

00:38:21.399 --> 00:38:25.236 region:rollup2
ARE GOVERNING DOCUMENTS WERE

00:38:22.834 --> 00:38:27.071 region:rollup2
RECENTLY REVISED AT THE ADVICE

00:38:25.236 --> 00:38:28.640 region:rollup2
OF COUNSEL IN AND THE

00:38:27.071 --> 00:38:30.909 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGEMENT OF COUNSEL.

00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:32.277 region:rollup2

00:38:32.277 --> 00:38:35.613 region:rollup2
ACCLAMATION.

00:38:33.845 --> 00:38:38.249 region:rollup2
SO AGAIN IT IS REALLY HAPPENING

00:38:35.613 --> 00:38:39.417 region:rollup2
ALREADY WHY DO WE NEED THIS BILL

00:38:38.249 --> 00:38:40.652 region:rollup2
AND I THINK MARJORIE'S

00:38:39.417 --> 00:38:42.854 region:rollup2
OBSERVATION IS A GOOD ONE.

00:38:40.652 --> 00:38:44.856 region:rollup2
AND FINALLY.

00:38:42.854 --> 00:38:46.891 region:rollup2
.

00:38:44.856 --> 00:38:50.295 region:rollup2
I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT.

00:38:46.891 --> 00:38:52.330 region:rollup2
IN COMPARING THIS SITUATION.

00:38:50.295 --> 00:38:55.667 region:rollup2
TO PUBLIC ELECTIONS ARE EITHER

00:38:52.330 --> 00:38:56.401 region:rollup2
SCHOOL BOARDS OR CITY COUNCILS.

00:38:55.667 --> 00:38:58.503 region:rollup2

QUALIFICATIONS TO RUN FOR CITY

00:38:58.503 --> 00:39:03.575 region:rollup2
COUNCIL AND FOR SCHOOL BOARD.

00:39:01.706 --> 00:39:06.511 region:rollup2
ARE SET BY STATUTE THEY'RE NOT

00:39:03.575 --> 00:39:08.580 region:rollup2
SET BY THE SCHOOL BOARD ITSELF.

00:39:06.511 --> 00:39:10.014 region:rollup2
OR THE CITY COUNCIL ITSELF AND

00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:11.783 region:rollup2
SECONDLY YOU'LL NOTICE THAT IN

00:39:10.014 --> 00:39:14.452 region:rollup2
THE SCHOOL BOARD SITUATION

00:39:11.783 --> 00:39:17.188 region:rollup2
THERE'S A SAFEGUARD THERE WERE.

00:39:14.452 --> 00:39:18.990 region:rollup2
PEOPLE CAN RAISE AN OBJECTION

00:39:17.188 --> 00:39:20.291 region:rollup2

ACCLAMATION.

00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:25.029 region:rollup2

COMMENTS ARE. FIRST OF ALL

00:40:43.741 --> 00:40:46.577 region:rollup2
PROPITIATE THE THE ROBUST

00:40:45.076 --> 00:40:48.446 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION I KNOW THIS HAS BEEN

00:40:46.577 --> 00:40:49.714 region:rollup2
AN ONGOING CONVERSATION FOR A

00:40:48.446 --> 00:40:50.948 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF YEARS. I'LL JUST SAY

00:40:49.714 --> 00:40:52.650 region:rollup2
FOR MYSELF FROM A PERSONAL

00:40:50.948 --> 00:40:54.719 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE FOR A FEW YEARS AGO

00:40:52.650 --> 00:40:56.721 region:rollup2
I MOVED INTO A BUILDING THAT.

00:40:54.719 --> 00:40:58.890 region:rollup2
HOUSING H. AWAY AND WE HAVE HAD

00:40:56.721 --> 00:41:00.992 region:rollup2
TROUBLE RECRUITING CANDIDATES.

00:40:58.890 --> 00:41:02.193 region:rollup2

AROUND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

00:41:06.798 --> 00:41:10.168 region:rollup2
AND SO I DO THINK THAT THE

00:41:08.166 --> 00:41:11.569 region:rollup2
AUTHOR IS TRYING TO ADDRESS THIS

00:41:10.168 --> 00:41:13.037 region:rollup2

00:41:13.037 --> 00:41:15.773 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY. BUT IN

00:41:14.272 --> 00:41:17.342 region:rollup2

TO MAKE THAT A LITTLE BIT

00:41:19.544 --> 00:41:24.182 region:rollup2
EASIER A BIT MORE EFFICIENT AND

00:41:22.013 --> 00:41:25.616 region:rollup2

WE WOULD ADD LANGUAGE THAT SAYS

00:42:20.171 --> 00:42:24.008 region:rollup2
THAT THERE'S A REQUIREMENT THAT

00:42:22.607 --> 00:42:24.842 region:rollup2

STATES THAT IF THERE AREN'T

00:42:30.481 --> 00:42:34.118 region:rollup2
ENOUGH CANDIDATES THE ELECTION

00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:35.486 region:rollup2

THINKING OF A SHARED AND I WAS

GONNA BRING ON THAT POINT

00:48:24.168 --> 00:48:26.370 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I DIDN'T APPRECIATE THE

00:48:26.370 --> 00:48:29.807 region:rollup2

00:48:30.808 --> 00:48:34.145 region:rollup2
SOON BUT I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR

00:48:32.576 --> 00:48:34.879 region:rollup2
THE BILL I APPRECIATE THE

00:48:34.145 --> 00:48:36.447 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTIVE DIALOGUE WITH A

00:48:34.879 --> 00:48:37.782 region:rollup2
CHAIR. ANY PARTICULARLY IN

00:48:36.447 --> 00:48:39.083 region:rollup2
REALLY A MAKING SURE IT'S

00:48:37.782 --> 00:48:40.084 region:rollup2
ABUNDANTLY CLEAR WITH THE

00:48:39.083 --> 00:48:42.653 region:rollup2
ADOPTION OF A RESOLUTION.

00:48:40.084 --> 00:48:44.121 region:rollup2
TO ALL INVOLVED THAT THERE'S

00:48:42.653 --> 00:48:44.855 region:rollup2
THIS MAY HAPPENS

00:48:44.121 --> 00:48:47.758 region:rollup2
I HONESTLY THIS BILL BECOMES

00:48:44.855 --> 00:48:49.827 region:rollup2
MOOT. IF MOST WHAT CAN THAT STEP

00:48:47.758 --> 00:48:51.028 region:rollup2
FORWARD LINK OUT AS SOMEBODY

00:48:49.827 --> 00:48:51.896 region:rollup2
SERVE ON THE CITY COUNCIL IS

00:48:51.028 --> 00:48:52.897 region:rollup2
OFTEN TOLD THAT WAS A TOUGH JOB

00:48:51.896 --> 00:48:53.664 region:rollup2
I WOULD ALWAYS ANSWER. BEYOND A

00:48:52.897 --> 00:48:54.665 region:rollup2
CHILE IS EVEN HARDER.

00:48:53.664 --> 00:48:56.133 region:rollup2
AND SO I UNDERSTAND THE

00:48:54.665 --> 00:48:57.301 region:rollup2
MEDICINES TO GET INVOLVED I LIKE

00:48:56.133 --> 00:48:58.836 region:rollup2
THE CHAIR AND I THINK LIKE THE

00:48:57.301 --> 00:49:00.404 region:rollup2
AUTHOR WOULD LIKE TO SEE A LOT

00:48:58.836 --> 00:49:01.572 region:rollup2
OF COMPETITION IN THESE RACES.

00:49:00.404 --> 00:49:02.907 region:rollup2
UP BUT ULTIMATELY I HAVE A

00:49:01.572 --> 00:49:04.775 region:rollup2
STRONG CONCERN ABOUT THE OVERALL

00:49:02.907 --> 00:49:06.377 region:rollup2
COST OF H. AWAY FEES AND WHAT

00:49:04.775 --> 00:49:07.812 region:rollup2
THAT MEANS A TO HOMEOWNERSHIP IN

00:49:06.377 --> 00:49:09.013 region:rollup2
OUR STATE. AND IF THERE'S AN

00:49:07.812 --> 00:49:10.748 region:rollup2
EFFICIENCY THE TABLE TO BE

00:49:09.013 --> 00:49:11.682 region:rollup2
ACHIEVED A PARTICULAR WITH THE

00:49:10.748 --> 00:49:13.184 region:rollup2
LACK OF COMPETITION.

00:49:11.682 --> 00:49:14.084 region:rollup2
THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE THAT

00:49:13.184 --> 00:49:16.086 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY I WOULD KNOW MISTER

00:49:14.084 --> 00:49:16.487 region:rollup2
CHAIRMAN THE TO THE FIVE CITIES

00:49:16.086 --> 00:49:17.688 region:rollup2
IN MY DISTRICT.

00:49:16.487 --> 00:49:18.823 region:rollup2
HAD TO CANCEL THE LAST

00:49:17.688 --> 00:49:20.024 region:rollup2
ELECTIONS FOR LACK OF A

00:49:18.823 --> 00:49:21.225 region:rollup2
COMPETITIVE RACES.

00:49:20.024 --> 00:49:22.993 region:rollup2
IF WE CAN DO IT FOR

00:49:21.225 --> 00:49:24.395 region:rollup2
MUNICIPALITIES I'M NOT SURE WHY

00:49:22.993 --> 00:49:25.329 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD APPLY TO EACH WAYS.

00:49:24.395 --> 00:49:26.897 region:rollup2
IT WOULD BE A GRADUAL

00:49:25.329 --> 00:49:27.965 region:rollup2
CIRCUMSTANCE I THINK COMPETITION

00:49:26.897 --> 00:49:30.000 region:rollup2
IS GREAT BUT IT'S THE REALITY

00:49:27.965 --> 00:49:30.267 region:rollup2
BEHIND OUR SELVES AND I'LL MOVE

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:32.336 region:rollup2
THE BILL.

00:49:30.267 --> 00:49:33.404 region:rollup2
AND LOOK WHAT ADDITIONAL

00:49:32.336 --> 00:49:36.874 region:rollup2
DIALOGUE IN JUDICIARY ON THE

00:49:33.404 --> 00:49:37.608 region:rollup2
FLOOR CHARACTERS MOTION MOVE IS

THAT HELP TO LIVE IN AND AND

00:55:21.785 --> 00:55:25.956 region:rollup2
THESE UNITS THE OTHER REQUIRES A

DEVELOPER TO PROVIDE EVIDENCE.

00:55:25.956 --> 00:55:29.126 region:rollup2
THAT THEY HAVE A CONTRACT WITH

THE LOCAL UNIVERSITY OR

COMMUNITY COLLEGE TO PROVIDE A

00:55:31.061 --> 00:55:33.597 region:rollup2
TO STUDENTS TO LIVE IN THE

00:55:32.129 --> 00:55:34.731 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT SO. THE SECOND

00:55:33.597 --> 00:55:36.533 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENT SAYS THE DEVELOPER

00:55:34.731 --> 00:55:38.001 region:rollup2
ARE YOU REALLY BUILDING STUDENT

00:55:36.533 --> 00:55:39.803 region:rollup2
HOUSING AND HAVE AN AGREEMENT

00:55:38.001 --> 00:55:41.171 region:rollup2
WITH LOCAL UNIVERSITIES TO DO SO

00:55:39.803 --> 00:55:42.239 region:rollup2
SO WE'RE REALLY. UP PUTTING

00:55:41.171 --> 00:55:43.574 region:rollup2
BELTS AND SUSPENDERS

00:55:42.239 --> 00:55:45.542 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS BOTH ON THE STUDENT

00:55:43.574 --> 00:55:48.011 region:rollup2
SIDE AS WELL AS ON THE DEVELOPER

00:55:45.542 --> 00:55:49.012 region:rollup2
SIDE SO THAT IT STUDENTS WHO WHO

00:55:48.011 --> 00:55:50.881 region:rollup2
NEED TO LIVE IN THE US AND IT'S

00:55:49.012 --> 00:55:53.350 region:rollup2
A DEVELOPER WHO IS COMMITTED. TO

00:55:50.881 --> 00:55:54.985 region:rollup2
DOING THIS WORK WITH A SPECIFIC

EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION.

00:55:54.985 --> 00:55:58.989 region:rollup2
OKAY I HAVE A LOT TO QUESTIONS.

00:55:56.787 --> 00:55:59.556 region:rollup2
NOT TO SENATOR ON THE MOON IS

00:55:58.989 --> 00:56:02.192 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:55:59.556 --> 00:56:04.294 region:rollup2
I ASSUME THAT THIS UP BILL

00:56:02.192 --> 00:56:05.796 region:rollup2
WOULD APPLY TO THE DEVELOPMENTS

00:56:04.294 --> 00:56:06.930 region:rollup2
ARE.

00:56:05.796 --> 00:56:08.665 region:rollup2
OH FIVE HOUSING OUTSIDE OF THE

00:56:06.930 --> 00:56:11.168 region:rollup2
CAMPUS

00:56:08.665 --> 00:56:12.236 region:rollup2
YES YES BECAUSE INSIDE IS SO UP

00:56:11.168 --> 00:56:15.472 region:rollup2
TO THE UNIVERSITY CORRECT AND

00:56:12.236 --> 00:56:16.874 region:rollup2
THEY AND AT LEAST ARE.

00:56:15.472 --> 00:56:18.275 region:rollup2
PUBLICLY OWNED UNIVERSITIES AND

00:56:16.874 --> 00:56:19.810 region:rollup2
HEARD AND DEPENDING ON THEIR

00:56:18.275 --> 00:56:22.512 region:rollup2
STATUS DON'T.

00:56:19.810 --> 00:56:24.448 region:rollup2
DON'T NEED THIS RELIEF BECAUSE.

00:56:22.512 --> 00:56:26.783 region:rollup2
THEY CAN APPLY THEIR OWN.

00:56:24.448 --> 00:56:28.685 region:rollup2
.

00:56:26.783 --> 00:56:29.586 region:rollup2
IT YEAH UNIVERSITY WOULD SET UP

00:56:28.685 --> 00:56:31.989 region:rollup2
BUT THEY OWN REGULATIONS OKAY

00:56:29.586 --> 00:56:33.257 region:rollup2
NUMBER TWO IS THAT I THOUGHT OF

00:56:31.989 --> 00:56:35.559 region:rollup2
THIS ARE A SPECIFIC.

00:56:33.257 --> 00:56:37.761 region:rollup2
THE OUR LOW INCOME HOUSING AND

00:56:35.559 --> 00:56:40.230 region:rollup2
A THIRTY FIVE PERCENT THE ATTEND

00:56:37.761 --> 00:56:42.432 region:rollup2
STEVE WARNER SO IS IN EFFECT A

00:56:40.230 --> 00:56:43.734 region:rollup2
IN OUR END OF THE.

00:56:42.432 --> 00:56:45.402 region:rollup2
STATUTES IS THAT TRUE. YES THE

00:56:43.734 --> 00:56:47.938 region:rollup2
DENSITY BONUS IS IN STATUTE BUT

00:56:45.402 --> 00:56:49.539 region:rollup2
IT'S BASED ON UNITS AND AS I

00:56:47.938 --> 00:56:50.807 region:rollup2
DESCRIBE IN MY OPENING.

00:56:49.539 --> 00:56:52.409 region:rollup2
CONFIGURATION OF STUDENT

00:56:50.807 --> 00:56:55.512 region:rollup2
HOUSING.

00:56:52.409 --> 00:56:57.848 region:rollup2
ONE COULD CONSIDER A DORM. I'D

00:56:55.512 --> 00:57:00.117 region:rollup2
IN EFFECT EITHER ONE UNIT OR IT

00:56:57.848 --> 00:57:01.418 region:rollup2
COULD TAKE AT BECAUSE THAT.

00:57:00.117 --> 00:57:02.686 region:rollup2
WHOLE DOOR MIGHT HAVE ONLY ONE

00:57:01.418 --> 00:57:04.788 region:rollup2
KITCHEN.

00:57:02.686 --> 00:57:07.024 region:rollup2
AND THREE BATHROOMS.

00:57:04.788 --> 00:57:07.591 region:rollup2
SO WITH THIS IS GOING TO ALLOW

00:57:07.024 --> 00:57:09.326 region:rollup2
THE DENSITY BONUS ON EITHER

00:57:07.591 --> 00:57:13.463 region:rollup2
BEDS.

00:57:09.326 --> 00:57:15.766 region:rollup2
OR BEDROOMS.

00:57:13.463 --> 00:57:19.336 region:rollup2
SO. YOU'RE NOT.

M. MAKE THE DISTINCTION ANY ARE

00:57:19.336 --> 00:57:26.376 region:rollup2
A STUDENT HOUSING. OUT WILL HAVE

00:57:22.572 --> 00:57:26.910 region:rollup2

00:57:44.027 --> 00:57:48.332 region:rollup2
FOR MANY STUDENTS IS BEING

00:57:45.829 --> 00:57:50.667 region:rollup2
NUMBER ONE FINANCIAL PRESSURE.

00:57:48.332 --> 00:57:52.035 region:rollup2

ELIMINATING OBSTACLES THAT.

00:59:17.387 --> 00:59:20.257 region:rollup2
COULD PREVENT CONDOMINIUM

00:59:18.755 --> 00:59:22.025 region:rollup2
RESIDENTS FROM ACCESSING

00:59:20.257 --> 00:59:23.994 region:rollup2
ELECTRIC VEHICLE. CHARGING

THE ROAD BY TWENTY THIRTY MAKE

00:59:43.380 --> 00:59:45.348 region:rollup2
SOLVING THIS PROBLEM EVEN MORE

00:59:43.980 --> 00:59:46.516 region:rollup2
URGENT.

00:59:45.348 --> 00:59:47.384 region:rollup2
I KNOW WHAT THE PRICE OF

00:59:46.516 --> 00:59:49.286 region:rollup2
ELECTRIC VEHICLES HAS BEEN

00:59:47.384 --> 00:59:51.288 region:rollup2
STEADILY DECREASING.

00:59:49.286 --> 00:59:52.656 region:rollup2
THE ACCESSIBILITY OF ELECTRIC

00:59:51.288 --> 00:59:53.690 region:rollup2

CONTINUES.

00:59:53.690 --> 00:59:57.561 region:rollup2
TO BE AN ISSUE.

00:59:55.926 --> 00:59:59.196 region:rollup2
NOW RESIDENTS WHO BELONG TO

00:59:57.561 --> 01:00:00.964 region:rollup2

01:00:00.964 --> 01:00:03.266 region:rollup2
IT DIFFICULT TO MAKE THE SWITCH

01:00:01.631 --> 01:00:05.168 region:rollup2
TO ELECTRIC VEHICLES BECAUSE

01:00:03.266 --> 01:00:07.104 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE TO USE. COMMON AREA

01:00:05.168 --> 01:00:08.004 region:rollup2
SPACES TO INSTALL THE NEEDED

THIS RESPECT.

01:00:25.989 --> 01:00:28.258 region:rollup2
NO CURRENT LAW PROHIBITS A

01:00:27.023 --> 01:00:29.826 region:rollup2
HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATION FROM

01:00:28.258 --> 01:00:31.595 region:rollup2
UNREASONABLY RESTRICTING A

TIME OF USE METER THAT MAKES

01:00:38.401 --> 01:00:41.238 region:rollup2

01:00:40.170 --> 01:00:42.606 region:rollup2
BILL SEEKS TO ADDRESS THIS GAP

01:00:41.238 --> 01:00:43.840 region:rollup2

CHAMPION MORE INSTALLATIONS OF

01:01:43.934 --> 01:01:47.571 region:rollup2
PHOEBE CHARGING STATIONS. ARE

01:01:46.102 --> 01:01:49.172 region:rollup2
APPLAUD THIS AND IF YOU HAVE AN

01:01:47.571 --> 01:01:50.440 region:rollup2

DOCTOR CHOI. YEAH WELL NO

01:01:59.149 --> 01:02:03.453 region:rollup2
QUESTION.

01:02:01.218 --> 01:02:05.455 region:rollup2
IT WAS JUST A DOG WITH A YA*

01:02:03.453 --> 01:02:07.524 region:rollup2
AWAY WHY NOT BLOW.

01:02:05.455 --> 01:02:09.226 region:rollup2
WHAT CAN WE BELIEVE AT THIS COME

01:02:07.524 --> 01:02:09.793 region:rollup2
UP WITH A PLAN NOW REQUIRE MY

01:02:09.226 --> 01:02:10.994 region:rollup2
STEP CLOSER EVERY HOMEOWNER

01:02:09.793 --> 01:02:12.162 region:rollup2
WILL?

01:02:10.994 --> 01:02:13.263 region:rollup2
THEIR COMMON INTEREST

01:02:12.162 --> 01:02:13.797 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT AREA HOMEOWNERS

01:02:13.263 --> 01:02:16.032 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATION NOT WOULD HAVE

01:02:13.797 --> 01:02:17.934 region:rollup2
THIER.

01:02:16.032 --> 01:02:19.002 region:rollup2
A BOARD MEMBER SAYS SITUATIONS

01:02:17.934 --> 01:02:20.537 region:rollup2
WOULD BE OR DIFFERENT THAT THEY

01:02:19.002 --> 01:02:22.439 region:rollup2
CAN DECIDE THAT WHY DO WE HAVE

01:02:20.537 --> 01:02:23.406 region:rollup2
TO.

01:02:22.439 --> 01:02:25.141 region:rollup2
I INTERVENED THEY OWN LOCAL

01:02:23.406 --> 01:02:27.110 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY.

01:02:25.141 --> 01:02:27.677 region:rollup2
SO THE ISSUE HAS TO DO WITH THEM

01:02:27.110 --> 01:02:29.613 region:rollup2
THE QUESTION OF TIME OF USE

01:02:27.677 --> 01:02:30.080 region:rollup2
METERS.

01:02:29.613 --> 01:02:31.648 region:rollup2
AND SO.

01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:33.416 region:rollup2
IT'S AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE

01:02:31.648 --> 01:02:34.317 region:rollup2
CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE AND FOR

01:02:33.416 --> 01:02:35.785 region:rollup2
THE MOST PART THEY'RE HAVING

01:02:34.317 --> 01:02:37.120 region:rollup2
MANY PROBLEMS AROUND THE STATE I

01:02:35.785 --> 01:02:38.555 region:rollup2
THINK IF YOU LOOK YOU KNOW. AS

01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:39.689 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I SERVE ON THE HOUSING

01:02:38.555 --> 01:02:41.191 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE ON THE SENATE SIDE.

01:02:39.689 --> 01:02:42.759 region:rollup2
THERE A LOT OF INTEREST GROUPS

01:02:41.191 --> 01:02:44.394 region:rollup2
TO COME IN IF THEY FEEL AS

01:02:42.759 --> 01:02:46.363 region:rollup2
THOUGH A BILL HAVE YOU. CREATES

01:02:44.394 --> 01:02:47.564 region:rollup2
ONEROUS OVERREGULATION OF

01:02:46.363 --> 01:02:48.832 region:rollup2
HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATIONS IN THIS

01:02:47.564 --> 01:02:50.734 region:rollup2
CASE WE'VE MET WITH THEM WE TALK

01:02:48.832 --> 01:02:51.968 region:rollup2
TO THEM AND AND AND THEY DON'T

01:02:50.734 --> 01:02:53.903 region:rollup2
FEEL AS THOUGH THIS IS ONEROUS.

01:02:51.968 --> 01:02:56.139 region:rollup2
BUT BUT ONLY ULTIMATELY IT'S

01:02:53.903 --> 01:02:58.508 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT SO THAT IF THERE'S ANY

01:02:56.139 --> 01:02:59.442 region:rollup2
BIT BASICALLY IN ORDER TO ALLOW

01:02:58.508 --> 01:03:01.878 region:rollup2
US TO REACH THE GOALS THAT WE

01:02:59.442 --> 01:03:03.680 region:rollup2
HAVE. WE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE

01:03:01.878 --> 01:03:05.115 region:rollup2
THAT PEOPLE WHO LIVING IN COMMON

01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:07.150 region:rollup2
USE PARKING.

01:03:05.115 --> 01:03:09.052 region:rollup2
CONDOMINIUMS HAVE ACCESS TO TIME

01:03:07.150 --> 01:03:10.487 region:rollup2
OF USE METER MEASURES.

01:03:09.052 --> 01:03:12.389 region:rollup2
AND SO WE'RE JUST TRYING TO MAKE

01:03:10.487 --> 01:03:13.657 region:rollup2
SURE THERE'S NO BARRIERS TO.

01:03:12.389 --> 01:03:14.658 region:rollup2
TO THE ACCESS TO THE THAT THIS

01:03:13.657 --> 01:03:16.726 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR TYPE OF OF

01:03:14.658 --> 01:03:17.727 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S NEEDED.

01:03:16.726 --> 01:03:19.095 region:rollup2
I MEAN YOU KNOW I THINK THE

01:03:17.727 --> 01:03:20.063 region:rollup2
CONCERNS I I'M A MEMBER OF ANY

01:03:19.095 --> 01:03:21.598 region:rollup2
CHOI SOMETIMES YOU HAVE FOLKS

01:03:20.063 --> 01:03:23.600 region:rollup2
WHO ARE STILL NOT QUITE OF A OF

01:03:21.598 --> 01:03:25.135 region:rollup2
A WHERE. BATTAGLIA'S AS ELECTRIC

01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:26.469 region:rollup2
CARS ARE GETTING MORE MORE

01:03:25.135 --> 01:03:27.737 region:rollup2
POPULAR IT'S A LOT OF FOLKS WHO

01:03:26.469 --> 01:03:30.440 region:rollup2
JUST HAVE NO IDEA ABOUT WHAT IT

01:03:27.737 --> 01:03:32.275 region:rollup2
TAKES TO. HAVE A MUCH REQUIRED

01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:32.776 region:rollup2
IT TO CHARGE IT I'M.

01:03:32.275 --> 01:03:33.943 region:rollup2
AND IN THE NEEDS NOT BE

01:03:32.776 --> 01:03:34.844 region:rollup2
SENSITIVE TO THE.

01:03:33.943 --> 01:03:38.348 region:rollup2
THE PARTICULAR NEEDS OF ELECTRIC

01:03:34.844 --> 01:03:40.417 region:rollup2
CARS.

01:03:38.348 --> 01:03:42.385 region:rollup2
SO AS I SAY WE'VE WE'VE.

01:03:40.417 --> 01:03:44.187 region:rollup2
ARE MAKING YOU KNOW JUST AS WELL

01:03:42.385 --> 01:03:45.388 region:rollup2
AS I THAT THERE THAT THERE ARE

01:03:44.187 --> 01:03:46.690 region:rollup2
LOTS OF BILLS THAT THAT

01:03:45.388 --> 01:03:48.258 region:rollup2
HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATION COMMUNITY

01:03:46.690 --> 01:03:49.259 region:rollup2
OBJECT TO YOU BECAUSE THEY FEEL

01:03:48.258 --> 01:03:51.027 region:rollup2
AS THOUGH THERE'S

01:03:49.259 --> 01:03:51.594 region:rollup2
MICROMANAGEMENT IN THIS CASE.

01:03:51.027 --> 01:03:53.029 region:rollup2
I THEY DON'T FEEL AS THOUGH

01:03:51.594 --> 01:03:54.798 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE CASE.

01:03:53.029 --> 01:03:56.366 region:rollup2
IT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THE

01:03:54.798 --> 01:03:59.336 region:rollup2
IDEA OF.

01:03:56.366 --> 01:04:00.236 region:rollup2
COMMON CHARGING STATION.

01:03:59.336 --> 01:04:01.705 region:rollup2
SO THIS ALL HAS TO DO WITH THE

01:04:00.236 --> 01:04:02.872 region:rollup2
FACT THAT YOU ELECTRIC

01:04:01.705 --> 01:04:04.941 region:rollup2
ELECTRICITY PRICES VARY BY THE

01:04:02.872 --> 01:04:06.943 region:rollup2
TIME OF DAY.

01:04:04.941 --> 01:04:08.478 region:rollup2
AND SO THEIR FOLKS YOU WANT TO

01:04:06.943 --> 01:04:10.046 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT THERE.

01:04:08.478 --> 01:04:12.382 region:rollup2
I DID THERE BEING PROPERLY

01:04:10.046 --> 01:04:15.118 region:rollup2
CHARGED.

01:04:12.382 --> 01:04:17.187 region:rollup2
NO PUN INTENDED I'VE FOR.

01:04:15.118 --> 01:04:18.054 region:rollup2
FOR THE ELECTRICITY THEY'RE

01:04:17.187 --> 01:04:19.222 region:rollup2
USING BASED ON THE TIME OF DAY

01:04:18.054 --> 01:04:20.924 region:rollup2
THAT THEY'RE USING IT

01:04:19.222 --> 01:04:22.359 region:rollup2
SO CAN BE MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE TO

01:04:20.924 --> 01:04:23.226 region:rollup2
CHARGE YOUR CAR AT CERTAIN TIMES

01:04:22.359 --> 01:04:25.328 region:rollup2
OF DAY THAN OTHER TIMES TODAY SO

01:04:23.226 --> 01:04:27.897 region:rollup2
IT'S AN IMPORTANT PART. OF

01:04:25.328 --> 01:04:28.498 region:rollup2
MAKING SURE THAT THE. OTHER THE

01:04:27.897 --> 01:04:29.766 region:rollup2
CHARGING PROCESS IS ECONOMICAL

01:04:28.498 --> 01:04:31.568 region:rollup2
FOR FOLKS

01:04:29.766 --> 01:04:34.070 region:rollup2
SO YOU'LL BE IN IT WOULD MAKE IT

01:04:31.568 --> 01:04:35.238 region:rollup2
EASIER TO CHARGE ANY TIME.

01:04:34.070 --> 01:04:36.806 region:rollup2
WELL THE VERY LEAST IT WOULD

01:04:35.238 --> 01:04:39.008 region:rollup2
MAKE IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO

01:04:36.806 --> 01:04:42.011 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT TO BE ABLE TO TRACK

01:04:39.008 --> 01:04:43.446 region:rollup2
AND BE PROPERLY CHARGE FOR THE.

01:04:42.011 --> 01:04:44.948 region:rollup2
THAT THE THE ELECTRICITY USED

01:04:43.446 --> 01:04:45.949 region:rollup2
THAT THERE.

01:04:44.948 --> 01:04:47.183 region:rollup2
TAKING FROM THE SYSTEM TO CHARGE

01:04:45.949 --> 01:04:49.085 region:rollup2
OUR CARS BASED ON THE TIME OF

01:04:47.183 --> 01:04:51.087 region:rollup2
DAY THAT THEY'RE DOING.

01:04:49.085 --> 01:04:53.256 region:rollup2
SO YOU BELIEVE SO TRYING TO MAKE

01:04:51.087 --> 01:04:53.857 region:rollup2
IT EASIER WILL ARE HARDER OF IT

01:04:53.256 --> 01:04:55.625 region:rollup2
I MEAN WE'RE TRYING MAKE IT

01:04:53.857 --> 01:04:57.427 region:rollup2
EASIER FOR THESE FOR THESE

01:04:55.625 --> 01:04:59.429 region:rollup2
DRIVERS ABSOLUTELY.

01:04:57.427 --> 01:05:00.630 region:rollup2
DIDN'T TO MAKE IT YOU KNOW.

01:04:59.429 --> 01:05:01.898 region:rollup2
TO TURN TO DID IT GIVE THEM

01:05:00.630 --> 01:05:04.634 region:rollup2
ANOTHER TOOL.

01:05:01.898 --> 01:05:06.069 region:rollup2
I HAD TO TO UNDERSTAND AND BE

01:05:04.634 --> 01:05:07.637 region:rollup2
ABLE TO CHARGE THEIR CARS IN AN

01:05:06.069 --> 01:05:08.972 region:rollup2
ECONOMICAL MANNER TO UNDERSTAND

01:05:07.637 --> 01:05:10.874 region:rollup2
ELECTRICITY PRICES ASSOCIATED

01:05:08.972 --> 01:05:11.441 region:rollup2
WITH CHARGING AND. MAKE SURE

01:05:10.874 --> 01:05:12.475 region:rollup2
THEY'RE DOING IT TIMES A DAY

01:05:11.441 --> 01:05:13.610 region:rollup2
WHEN.

01:05:12.475 --> 01:05:15.512 region:rollup2
WHEN ONE IS LESS EXPENSIVE IF

01:05:13.610 --> 01:05:17.380 region:rollup2
THEY WANT TO.

01:05:15.512 --> 01:05:18.414 region:rollup2
ECONOMICAL MAN I MEAN IS THAT

01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:18.915 region:rollup2
THE YOU ARE TRYING TO RESTRICT

01:05:18.414 --> 01:05:21.151 region:rollup2
IT'LL TO CHARGE A AFTER

01:05:18.915 --> 01:05:22.519 region:rollup2
MIDNIGHT.

01:05:21.151 --> 01:05:24.854 region:rollup2
NO THEY CAN CHARGE WHATEVER THEY

01:05:22.519 --> 01:05:26.723 region:rollup2
WANT BUT THE BUT THE TIME OF USE

01:05:24.854 --> 01:05:27.791 region:rollup2
METER MONITORS WHEN THEY'RE

01:05:26.723 --> 01:05:29.959 region:rollup2
CHARGING AND HOW THEY'RE

01:05:27.791 --> 01:05:31.761 region:rollup2
CHARGING IN THE COMMAND OF.

01:05:29.959 --> 01:05:33.997 region:rollup2
OF OF CHARGES ARE USING. AND

01:05:31.761 --> 01:05:36.633 region:rollup2
THEY CAN THEN BE. CHARGED

01:05:33.997 --> 01:05:38.802 region:rollup2
FINANCIALLY ARE. YOU KNOW I

01:05:36.633 --> 01:05:39.335 region:rollup2
BASED ON ON THEIR USAGE BUT IF

01:05:38.802 --> 01:05:40.570 region:rollup2
YOU DON'T HAVE TIME TO USE

01:05:39.335 --> 01:05:42.872 region:rollup2
MANNER.

01:05:40.570 --> 01:05:46.242 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO OUR WAY OF MONITORING

01:05:42.872 --> 01:05:49.012 region:rollup2
THE ELECTRICITY USE THAT YOU ARE

01:05:46.242 --> 01:05:50.146 region:rollup2
USING TWO I HAD TO CHARGE A CAR.

01:05:49.012 --> 01:05:51.981 region:rollup2
YOU THERE'S NO THERE'S NO WAY TO

01:05:50.146 --> 01:05:52.749 region:rollup2
MONITOR THE FACT THAT DID THAT

01:05:51.981 --> 01:05:53.817 region:rollup2
YOU CHARGE DURING A CERTAIN

01:05:52.749 --> 01:05:55.819 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF TIME IS THIS AMOUNT OF

01:05:53.817 --> 01:05:57.620 region:rollup2
ELECTRICITY AND SO YOU ARE TO BE

01:05:55.819 --> 01:05:58.922 region:rollup2
CHARGED A CERTAIN AMOUNT.

01:05:57.620 --> 01:06:00.490 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE CHARGE WE CHARGE

01:05:58.922 --> 01:06:01.791 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF MONEY FOR

01:06:00.490 --> 01:06:03.359 region:rollup2
ELECTRICITY YOU SPACE ON THE

01:06:01.791 --> 01:06:06.162 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT TIMES OF THE DAY YEAH

01:06:03.359 --> 01:06:06.996 region:rollup2
I KNOW SO SO PEOPLE CAN YOU CAN

01:06:06.162 --> 01:06:07.797 region:rollup2
YOU CAN CHARGE AT NIGHT YOU

01:06:06.996 --> 01:06:09.766 region:rollup2
COULD CHARGE AND THAT YOU DO

01:06:07.797 --> 01:06:11.434 region:rollup2
WHATEVER YOU WANT. BUT IF YOU

01:06:09.766 --> 01:06:13.470 region:rollup2
HAVE A TIME OF USE METER. IT

CHARGE FOR FOR THAT FOR THE

01:06:17.073 --> 01:06:20.610 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF ELECTRICITY VIEWS IN

01:06:18.208 --> 01:06:21.444 region:rollup2
THE TIME OF DAY YOU'VE USED IT.

01:06:20.610 --> 01:06:23.146 region:rollup2
SO WE'RE JUST TRYING TO MAKE

01:06:21.444 --> 01:06:24.247 region:rollup2
SURE THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT

01:06:23.146 --> 01:06:26.382 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT THERE'S NO

BARRIERS TO THE. IMPLEMENTATION

01:06:26.382 --> 01:06:29.552 region:rollup2
OF THAT PARTICULAR TYPE OF

01:06:27.484 --> 01:06:30.787 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:06:29.552 --> 01:06:33.456 region:rollup2
MY DO I NEED THAT THE.

01:06:30.787 --> 01:06:35.592 region:rollup2
A TIME UP TO YOU SAW.

THEIR.

01:06:45.835 --> 01:06:49.272 region:rollup2
DEPENDING HOW THEY STRUCTURE

01:06:47.804 --> 01:06:51.040 region:rollup2
THEIR ELECTRICITY CHARGES FOR

01:06:49.272 --> 01:06:53.009 region:rollup2
THAT FOR COMMON SPACES THEY

01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:54.510 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES WILL WANT TO MAKE SURE

01:06:53.009 --> 01:06:55.545 region:rollup2
THAT PEOPLE. ARE YOU ARE IF

YOU'RE USING A LOT OF

01:06:55.545 --> 01:06:57.514 region:rollup2
ELECTRICITY DOWN THE COMMON

01:06:56.846 --> 01:06:58.615 region:rollup2
SPACE THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE AS

01:06:57.514 --> 01:07:00.216 region:rollup2
WELL THAT.

01:06:58.615 --> 01:07:02.118 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF

01:07:00.216 --> 01:07:04.153 region:rollup2
WHO'S USING AND WHEN. BUT THE

01:07:02.118 --> 01:07:06.322 region:rollup2
FACT IS FOR BETTER FOR WORSE AND

01:07:04.153 --> 01:07:07.357 region:rollup2
IN YOU WE CAN DISCUSS THIS AS

01:07:06.322 --> 01:07:09.125 region:rollup2
EVERYONE KNOWS IN THE ENERGY

01:07:07.357 --> 01:07:10.426 region:rollup2
SPACE. WE DO CHARGE DIFFERENT

01:07:09.125 --> 01:07:14.397 region:rollup2
AMOUNTS OF MONEY FOR DIFFERENT

01:07:10.426 --> 01:07:16.299 region:rollup2
TIMES A DAY. OF ELECTRICITY USE.

01:07:14.397 --> 01:07:18.835 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I SOLAR GETS MORE AND

01:07:16.299 --> 01:07:20.303 region:rollup2
MORE ONLINE. IT ACTUALLY I THINK

01:07:18.835 --> 01:07:21.638 region:rollup2
IN SOME RESPECTS MAKES SENSE TO

01:07:20.303 --> 01:07:22.605 region:rollup2
START TO FLIP THE MODEL I

01:07:21.638 --> 01:07:24.240 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA HAVE AN

01:07:22.605 --> 01:07:25.074 region:rollup2
EXCESS OF ENERGY DURING THE TILL

01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:27.544 region:rollup2
THE DAY.

01:07:25.074 --> 01:07:29.479 region:rollup2
AND AND AND IT DE AND AND NOT

01:07:27.544 --> 01:07:31.481 region:rollup2

THE OLD. THE OLD SYSTEM WERE

01:07:31.481 --> 01:07:34.984 region:rollup2
STILL CHARGING PEOPLE MORE FOR

01:07:33.783 --> 01:07:38.154 region:rollup2
ELECTRICITY USE.

01:07:34.984 --> 01:07:39.689 region:rollup2
DURING THE DAY THAN AT NIGHT.

01:07:38.154 --> 01:07:41.291 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S A BROADER KIND OF

01:07:39.689 --> 01:07:41.824 region:rollup2
PROBLEM THAT I LOVE TO WORK WITH
