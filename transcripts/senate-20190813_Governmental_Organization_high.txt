INFORMATIONAL HEARING TITLED UTILIZATION OF EXCESS STATE LAND FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW THE LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS ONE OF IF NOT THE BIGGEST ISSUE FACING CALIFORNIA TODAY. ACCORDING TO STATE OFFICIALS FROM. TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN TO TWO THOUSAND TWENTY FIVE APPROXIMATELY ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION NEW HOUSING UNITS ARE NEEDED. TO MEET THE PROJECTED POPULATION GROWTH OR A HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND HOMES ANNUALLY. THIS NUMBER IS FAR HIGHER THAN THE CURRENT AVERAGE OF EIGHTY THOUSAND HOMES PER YEAR THAT ARE CURRENTLY BEING BUILT IN THE STATE CALIFORNIA. THE IMPACT OF THE LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS WELL DOCUMENTED OUR CONSTITUENTS OR OVERPAYING FOR HOUSING COMMUTE COMMUTING LONG DISTANCES BETWEEN THEIR HOMES AND THEIR WORK LIVING IS OVER IN OVERCROWDED HOMES AND UNFORTUNATELY EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. THE HIGH COST OF HOUSING ALSO INCREASES HEALTHCARE COSTS DECREASES EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES IT MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN EMPLOYEES. FACED WITH THIS ISSUE EARLIER THIS YEAR GOVERNOR NEWSOME SIGNED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER TO DEVELOP AFFORDABLE HOUSING ON ACCESS STATE LANDS. EXECUTIVE ORDER DIRECTED THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES AND THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT TO IDENTIFY AND PRIORITIZE ACCESS STATE OWNED PROPERTY AND AGGRESSIVELY PURSUE SUSTAINABLE AND COST EFFECTIVE HOUSING PROJECTS. IN APRIL TGS ARE IDENTIFIED IN INITIAL INVENTORY OF 440-003-0070 STATE OWNED PARCELS THIRTEEN HUNDRED THIRTY OF WHICH WERE FLIGHT IS POTENTIALLY VIABLE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THE D. G. S. H. ET ARE CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF REVIEWING THOSE PARCELS AND BEGINNING IN SEPTEMBER WILL ISSUE A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS AND BEGIN THE DEVELOPMENTAL. DEVELOPMENT PROCESS AS WE WORK TO SOLVE THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA I'M HOPEFUL THE STATE WILL WORK COOPERATIVELY WITH OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING ORGANIZATIONS TO FIND CREATIVE SOLUTIONS TO THESE VERY IMPORTANT ISSUES THAT WE FACE. AS SUCH I HOPE TODAY'S HEARING WILL PROVIDE THE LEGISLATURE MEMBERS THE PUBLIC WITH AN UPDATE AS TO THE STATUS OF THE GOAL SET FORTH BY THE EXECUTIVE ORDER AND ALLOW LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING ORGANIZATIONS WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE THEIR VIEWS ON THE EXECUTIVE ORDER. LET ME THANK ALL THE WITNESSES ADVANCE FOR BEING HERE TODAY IF THE REPRESENTATIVES FROM TGS ACD. COULD PLEASE COME FORWARD NOW SO WE CAN BEGIN. THOSE. MORNING MR CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR HAVING US EXCITED TO BE ABLE TO PRESENT AN EXECUTIVE ORDER. EVERYONE CAN SEE OVER MY HEAD I'M ASSUMING PERFECT SO. THE FIRST THING I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT AND BY THE WAY I'M HAPPY TO MAKE THIS INTERACTIVE IF YOU'VE GOT A QUESTION YOU WANT TO ASK IN THE MIDDLE OF IT PLEASE FEEL FREE TO INTERJECT AS OPPOSED TO WAITING TO THE END BUT THE FIRST THING I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT JUST HIGHLIGHTS OF THE EXECUTIVE ORDER IN PARTICULAR WHY THIS IS A FIRST OF ITS KIND PROPERTY INVENTORY SO A LITTLE BACKGROUND THE STATE STATUTORY FRAMEWORK FOR PROPERTY I'M PAINTING WITH A BROAD BRUSH HERE IS PRETTY SIMPLE. STATE OF CALIFORNIA OWNS PROPERTY AND THE PROPERTY IS INVESTED WITH DEPARTMENT PRESSED TO UTILIZE THAT PROPERTY IN FURTHERANCE OF THEIR MISSION SO DMD FOR EXAMPLE DMV OWNS A DMB DOES NOT APPLY LENDS THAT CALIFORNIA OWNS A PLOT OF LAND THAT LAND IS ENTRUSTED TO DMB. TO UTILIZE IT FOR SAY A FIELD OFFICE. AND IT'S UNDER THEIR JURISDICTIONS OPERATIONAL CONTROL. AT SOME POINT IN TIME THOUGH THAT LAND NO LONGER SERVICES THEIR NEEDS MAY BE THEIR CONSTITUENTS CHANGE MAY BE THE CITY HAS MOVED A LITTLE BIT NORTHWARD MAYBE NEED A BIGGER OFFICE WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE THAT PROPERTY NO LONGER SERVICES THEIR NEEDS. AND THEY WOULD THEN DECLARE ACCESS ONCE A DEPARTMENT DECLARED PROPERTY TO BE EXCESS AGAIN IT'S REALLY DUMB SAYING. THIS PROPERTY STILL BELONG THE STATE SHOULD BE STATE PROPERTY BUT WE DON'T NEED IT ANYMORE. TGS GETS TAGGED TO COME IN AND FACILITATE A- OF THE BEGINNING OF A DISPOSITION PROCESS AND THE INITIAL STEPS AND STATURE SENSUALLY ARE TO LOOK AT OTHER STATE. READ THIS. MAYBE DMB DOESN'T NEED IT A. B. C. H. P. DOES MAYBE E. D. TO. THOSE SORTS OF THINGS WE ALSO CAN LOOK AT LONG TERM LEASING DEPENDING ON THE NATURE OF THE PROPERTY AND- WHETHER IT'S NEEDED. NOW MAYBE NOT BUT MAYBE IN THE FUTURE AT SOME POINT TIME WE DON'T WANNA GET RID OF THE PROPERTY WE CAN ENTER TO SOME SORT OF MEDIUM OR LONG TERM LEAST TO SORT OF. CONTINUE UTILIZATION. BUT IN THE DAY. WE START LOOKING AT EITHER STATE RE USE OR OR LEASING. ONCE THAT FAILS. IF THAT FAILS I WOULD SAY FOR MOST PARTS. PROPERTIES OFTEN TRANSFERRED OTHER STATE AGENCIES IT IS MOST COMMON. THAT DO A NUMBER OF FACTORS THEY THEN GO TO THE NEXT THE. PROCESS OF. GOING TO A DIFFERENT AGENCY. IS AN THE CARD. THE LEGISLATURE. AT THAT POINT IN TIME THE STATE IS AUTHORIZED TO POTENTIALLY A SAID THERE'S NO LAW FIRST. AS THE STATE'S AUTHORIZED TO DISPOSITION THE PROPERTY IN A VARIETY OF WAYS WERE THAT SAILED TRANSFERS EXCHANGE ACOSTA LEAST AND DO THINGS LIKE THAT WE CAN STILL GIVE IT TO A STATE DEPARTMENT. AVENUE NEED COMES UP BUT FOR THE MOST PART WANT SOMETHING A SURPLUS FOR AUTHORIZED TO DISPOSE OF IT NOW IN THE IN WHATEVER WAY BENEFITS THE STATE. THIS IS THE FOR THE FRAMEWORK PROCESS AND EVERY YEAR DEPARTMENTS TYPICALLY DECLARE SOME NUMBER OF PROPERTIES BE ACCESS. BUT IT MIGHT BE ONE MIGHT BE TO FORCE A REALLY GOOD YEAR THERE'S NOT A WHOLE. WE WERE WE GET THE- CAR IN THE ACCESS. TO THE EXECUTIVE ORDER SAID WAS LET'S GO TAKE A PROACTIVE LOOK REGARDLESS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF DECLARING LET'S REALLY DIG INTO WHAT PROPERTIES ARE OUT THERE WHAT MIGHT BE UNDER UTILIZED WERE NOT BEING UTILIZED AT ALL AND WHAT COULD BE TERMED ACCESS AND- REINVIGORATED FOR HOUSING. I SHOULD KNOW TO. IN THE SUCH STORES FOR SURPLUS POSSIBLE LOADING ORGANIZATION. LEGISLATURE HAS DIRECTED TO THE HOUSE. THE. THESE PROPERTY THAT'S NO LONGER NEED BY THE STATE. SO WE DID A- ACTIVE LOOK ALL TALK ABOUT THE RESULTS OF THAT LOOKING ALL TALK ABOUT KIND OF HOW WE APPROACHED IN A SLIDER TO BUT THIS REALLY IS A FIRST OF ITS KIND INVENTORY OF STATE PROPERTY THAT HAS BEEN DONE BEFORE WHICH WERE VERY EXCITED TO SHARE DETAILS ON. I'M THE EXECUTIVE ORDER ALSO JUST KIND OF BACK TO THIS LINE HIGHLIGHTS IT DOES REQUIRE A VERY SYSTEMATIC AN OBJECTIVE APPROACH THE PROPERTY WE DID APPROACH THIS LIKE A FINAL AND I THINK IT'LL BE MADE CLEAR AS THE PRESENTATION CONTINUES BUT IT ALSO TALKS ABOUT HOW WE GO ABOUT DEVELOPING SO IT FOCUSES ON INNOVATIVE CONSTRUCTION APPROACHES WHETHER THAT SUSTAINABLE PRO WORKFORCE CENTER FOR. EQUITABLE PRO APPROACH IT DOES. ON ON PARTNERSHIP OF THE PRINCE. IT'S PLAYED OUT SO FAR AND HOW THAT WILL PLAY OUT IN THE AND IT REALLY DOES FOCUS ON EXPEDITED DEVELOPMENTS. THERE'S NO WAY YOU WHATEVER THE FINAL NUMBER OF UP TO. BE THAT THEY'RE ALL GONNA HAPPEN AT ONCE THIS IS GONNA BE A PERIOD OF TIME BUT OBVIOUSLY IN OUR PRIORITIZATION EFFORTS WERE FOCUSING ON THE THINGS THAT CAN GET DONE SOONER THAN LATER. SO WE CAN GET AS MUCH BUILT IN THE SHORT TERM AS WELL AS THE MEDIUM TO LONG TERM. SO WHAT. WE'VE DONE AND WHERE WE GOING. SO THE INITIAL INVENTORY AS SENATOR ROBB MENTIONED WAS INITIALLY COMPLETED. 440-003-0070 PARCELS USING COUNTY ASSESSOR DATA WERE VISUALLY LOOKED AT WITH A TEAM OF NINE PEOPLE DEDICATED FOR THREE MONTHS DOING EXACTLY THAT. THEY PULLED A SHEET FILES WHICH ARE BASICALLY VISUAL. VIEWS THE PARCELS. AND THEY WERE LOOKING FOR UTILIZATION. OR LACK THERE OF. AND THEY WERE LOOKING FOR PRETTY LIBERAL. FACTORS THAT INDICATE THE HOUSING MIGHT BE VIABLE THERE SO IT'S A LITTLE FACTORS I MEAN WE DELIBERATELY TRY TO PULL IN MORE. PROPERTIES THAN BEING IN A- FORM EXCLUSIONARY THAT PUT IN THE PROCESS. SO IF SOMETHING WAS. WATER LITERALLY IT'S OBVIOUSLY NOW. IF SOMETHING'S IN THE MOUNTAINS SOMEWHERE IN THE FOREST IS OBVIOUSLY NO BUT IF. YOU KNOW IN A IN A QUOTE. FOR URBAN AREA CRITICALLY SOMETHING THAT'S THE. LEAST GENERALLY CLOSE TO RESIDENTIAL HE GOT INCLUDED IN. KIND OF MAKING A VENN DIAGRAM IN YOUR HEADS IT'S WHERE DOES PROPERTY SEEM TO BE UNDER UTILIZED. AND THEN WHERE DOES DEVELOPMENT SEEM TO BE VIABLE FROM HIGH LEVEL WE DID EXCLUDE PARCELS THAT WERE REALLY REALLY TERRIBLY GRADED SO YEAH HUGE SLOPES THINGS LIKE THAT THINGS THAT WOULD MAKE DEVELOPMENTS MORE EXPENSIVE. OR LESS LIKELY TO OCCUR. FOR THE MOST PART THIS WAS A PRETTY BIG BROAD GRAB. AFTER THAT PIECE WAS DONE AND CONCURRENT TO THE INVENTORY TGS HD WERE DEVELOPING A SCREENING TOOL. THAT SCREENING TOOL IN THERE'S A SLIGHT ON IT COMING UP WAS NOT MEANT TO ELIMINATE THE PARCELS SO MUCH AS IT WAS STUCK TO HELP US KIND OF PRIORITIZE THEM. AND I UNDERSTAND WHERE HOUSING MIGHT BE MORE OR LESS VIABLE. FOR PICK ASIDE OVER AGAINST ANOTHER ONE. AFTER THAT WAS DONE THE NEXT BIG STEP AND THE MOST DAUNTING I THINK WAS THE DEPARTMENTAL BETTING SO WHAT THAT MEANS IS. IN A WEEK WE LOOK AT A SITE AND WE HAVE A PIECE OF PROPERTY THAT LOOKS LIKE IT'S EMINENTLY DEVELOP HOLE. WE'VE SCREENED IT'S AND IT MEETS A LOT OF THE FACTORS THAT YOU WOULD EXPECT TO SEE A GOOD AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT TO NEED TO HAVE IN ORDER TO BE DEVELOPED. BUT WE TALK TO THE DEPARTMENT ULTIMATELY ABOUT IT. WE NEED TO ASK WHETHER OR NOT THAT SITE HAD ANY SORT OF ENCUMBRANCES THAT WOULD PRECLUDE DEVELOPMENT. MAYBE OVER THE LAST THIRTY YEARS THERE HAVE BEEN YOU KNOW. A LONG TERM EASEMENTS GRANTED TO PRIVATE SECTOR ENTITIES THE LOCALS. TO RUN UTILITIES THROUGHOUT THEIR THAT WOULD BE REALLY EXPENSIVE TO MOVE OR MAYBE. THE PROPERTY HAS A MEDIATION ISSUES OR MAYBE THE PROPERTY WAS A SHE TO THE STATE TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO FOR A VERY SPECIFIC PURPOSE. AND WOULD REQUIRE A CHANGE IN STATUTE TO. ALTER ITS USE. WE DIDN'T KNOW THOSE THINGS INITIAL INVENTORY AND SO ALL THE SITES THAT WE THEN. IDENTIFIED AS PART OF THAT THIRTEEN AND THIRTY PARCELS WHERE THAN VETTED WITH APARTMENTS. FROM THERE. WE GOT DOWN TO A SMALLER NUMBER OF SITES THAT DEPARTMENTS HAVE SAID YES WE AGREE. THIS COULD OR SHOULD BE DECLARED ACCESS WE NO LONGER NEEDED THERE ARE KNOWN CONFERENCES ON THE SITE THAT WOULD PRECLUDE DEVELOPMENT. WE ARE FINE WITH THESE BEING DECLARED ACCESSING GOING THROUGH. THE REST OF EXECUTIVE ORDER PROCESS I SHOULD SHOULD KNOW THEIR- JUST A SEC OF POSTERITY THAT WHEN WE DO POLICY SITES. I'M SURE SURE THERE'S GOING TO BE A SITE OR TWO OR SEVEN. EACH OF YOUR DISTRICTS THAT WHERE YOU'RE CAN BE CONFUSED AS TO WHY IT'S NOT ON THE LIST BECAUSE YOU. ABSENT SURE THAT IT WASN'T UTILIZED APPROPRIATELY OR WHATEVER ELSE THE CASE MAY BE. THERE ARE THERE ARE THOSE AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT HOW WE KIND OF WANNA WELCOME THAT FEEDBACK COMING SOON. BUT THE SIMPLE IN TIME YOU KNOW THERE'S A THERE'S APPEALS PROCESS WHICH ARE GOING TO DEPARTMENTS OR SOMETHING THAT WILL OBVIOUSLY BE GOING AND WORKING WITH THEM ON AND CHALLENGING A LITTLE BIT BUT- FOR THE MOST PART THE SITES THAT WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT RELEASED THE INVENTORY WE HAVE. ARE BASED ON ALL OF THOSE INITIAL YESES AGAIN WE'RE KIND OF FOCUSING ON SPEED WHAT WE CAN GET OUT FIRST. WHILE WE LOOK AT A MEDIUM AND LONG TERM. ROLL OUT PLAN. SO AFTER BERMAN VETTING WHICH IS DONE. THE NEXT TWO BIG STEPS FOR US WERE SITE PRIVATIZATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF A HEAT MAP. THE EXECUTIVE ORDER ULTIMATELY CALLS FOR THE PUBLICATION OF A MAP THAT SHOWS THE AVAILABLE ACCESS SITES. SUPERIMPOSED WITH A MAP THAT SHOWS WHERE HOUSING IS GENERALLY NEEDED. SO AGAIN GOING BACK TO THAT AND DIAGRAM YOU COULD SAY. HERE'S NAPA COUNTY HERE THE- FAX NUMBER OF SITES AVAILABLE NAPA COUNTY. AND HERE'S THOSE PORTIONS NAPA COUNTY WHERE. HOUSING IS NEEDED IN PLACES WHERE IT'S NEED LESS. SO BE A QUICK EASY VISUAL FOR GOING TO KIND OF SEE AND HOPEFULLY. YOU KNOW A CHECK ON US AS TO WHERE WE'RE GONNA PRIORITIZE. DEVELOPMENTS THE PUBLICATION. OF THE HEAT MAP. IS FORTHCOMING. AND THEN AT THAT POINT. WHAT KIND OF CONCURRENT TO IT WE NEED TO DO A NUMBER OF REALISTIC TO DILIGENCE STEPS SO RATHER THAN ISSUE ARE PEAS SORT OF SIGHT UNSEEN WE- ASKED FOR AND RECEIVED FUNDING IN THE LAST BUDGET CYCLE. TO DO SORT OF PREDELLA WORK SO WE WOULD BE HIRING A REALISTIC CONSULTANT TO COME OUT AND DO AN ECONOMIC ANALYSIS ON A MITCHELL SITES. HELP MAKE SURE THERE ARE PEAS ARE TAILORED TO THE PARTICULAR DOUBLE ABILITY OF A PARTICULAR SITE WE ALSO WANT TO DO LIKE A FIRE ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT PHASE ONE ASSESSMENT. THE MANAGER TECHNICAL TESTING PULL TYLER POURED VALIDATE THAT THE PROPERTY BOUNDARIES THINGS LIKE THAT SO THAT WE KNOW TO WORRY REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD OF DOING IN OUR P. FINDING. SOMETHING THAT WOULD DEVELOP. MAKE SURE THAT WE GO OUT WITH HIS HAS TEED UP AS POSSIBLE FOR DEVELOPERS TO. BUILD AND THEN OF COURSE THE FINAL STEP IN THE PROCESS IS THE ISSUE INSOFAR AS PEACE. TO REALLY WE ARE. YOU KNOW VERY VERY CLOSE TO THE PUBLICATION HEAT MAP AND THE LAST TWO STEPS. THE REALISTIC YOU DILIGENCE AND THE ACTIONS OF THEIR FEES ARE WE HAVE IN FRONT OF US. THE SEPTEMBER DEADLINE THAT WAS MENTIONED EARLIER WITH THERE IS A DEADLINE AN EXECUTIVE ORDER TO ISSUE AT LEAST THE FIRST. SET OF OUR PEAS BY THE END OF SEPTEMBER. WE ARE ON TRACK TO DO THAT AGAIN THIS IS GONNA RUN WAVES THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE YOU KNOW. TWO HUNDRED OUR KEYS AT ONCE IT'S GOING TO BE SOME NUMBER OF THEM WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE LOVED. LEARNING OUR LESSONS EFFECTIVELY WE WANNA MAKE SURE THAT AS WE GET OUR PEACE OUT AND WE GET RESPONSES. THINGS ARE GONNA GO RIGHT THINGS ARE GONNA GO WRONG WE WANNA LEARN FROM THOSE AS OPPOSED TO DOING A MASSIVE WAVE OF THINGS. AND KIND OF. FINDING OUT THERE SOME FATAL FLAW IN THEM. THE OTHER ELEMENT TO I THINK IS IMPORTANT IS ALSO LIMITED STAFF TO PASS SITTING SO WHERE CONNECTING TO DO THAT. AS WELL JUDICIOUSLY. SO OUR INVENTORY. 440-003-0070 PARCELLS AGAIN VISUAL REVIEW WE LOOKED AT GRADING UTILIZATION. ADJACENT SEES AGAIN IS AN EXTRA RESIDENTIAL IS THERE APPEAR TO BE. AMENITIES THAT WOULD BE SUPPORTIVE OF HOUSING. AGAIN IN A PRETTY BROAD VERY LITTLE SENSE. WE DID ALSO LOOK AT ALTERNATE DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE MOST PART AND WE FLAG SOME PROPERTIES THAT ARE ON THE BORDERLINE WE ALSO LOOKED AT PROPERTIES THAT HAD SOME DEGREE OF UTILIZATION. BUT WE'RE BOB OWNED BUT OR BY OPERATED BY DEPARTMENTS WHO HAVE A HISTORY OF TURNING PROPERTIES OVER SO YOU SEE AGE PETER DMV'S MAKING SURE THAT THOSE SITES FOR LOOK AT PRETTY HARD. THAT DID GET DOWN TO ABOUT THIRTEEN HER THIRTY PARCELS WE THEN STOPPED USING THE PARCEL DOCUMENT DESIGNATION WE START LOOKING AT SITES SO FOR EXAMPLE. CAPITOL PARK HERE THIS IS NOT ONE PIECE OF PROPERTY FROM AND L. INTENT THAN FIFTEEN THAT'S MADE UP OF MORTAL PARCELS. AND SO RATHER THAN KIND OF TALKING THIS PARCEL DEMARCATION AND GETTING FOLKS MAYBE MISLEADING AS TO HOW MANY PROPERTIES ARE OUT THERE WE STARTED SAYING LET'S LET'S GROUP THESE THINGS TOGETHER IN TERMS OF WHAT WILL BE ACTUALLY DOUBLE DOUBLE. AS WE STARTED USING SITES AS THE TERM THOSE THIRTEEN AND THIRTY PARCELS NATURALLY COALESCED INTO ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY SITES. AND THEN WE WENT THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF VETTING PROCESS AND RIGHT NOW WE'RE SITTING IN A ABOUT A HUNDRED SITES. THAT HAD GOTTEN YES IS NO WHICH IS THAT'S A HUNDRED MORE THAN HE STARTED WITH WHICH IS FANTASTIC. THAT NUMBER'S GONNA FLUCTUATES AND I CAN ALMOST PROMISE THAT IT'S GONNA FLUCTUATE BECAUSE OF SOME THOSE APPEALS I MENTIONED IT'S GOING TO FLUCTUATE BECAUSE- WE ARE ALSO KINDA DOING OVERLAYS OF. YOU STATE HAZARD MAPS AND THINGS LIKE THAT IT'S GOING TO FLUCTUATE BECAUSE OF. LOCAL TO ENTITIES COMING FOR WITH DEALS THAT WE HADN'T CONSIDERED BEFORE YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE. I WAS WHICH COUNTY IT WAS BUT THERE WAS ONE COUNTY WHO. WE HAD ACTUALLY EXCLUDED A SITE IN OUR INITIAL INVENTORY IT WAS IN ITSELF COMPLETELY NOT APPROPRIATE FOR HOUSING IT WAS WAY OUT IN THE WOODS. BUT THEY WANTED TO USE IT FOR AN ALTERNATE PURPOSE AND THEY'RE WILLING TO DO A LAND SWAP BETWEEN THAT PROPERTY AND A DECENT SURVEY CREATURES THAT WAS RESIDENTIALLY LOCATED. AND SO YOU KNOW THOSE SORTS OF DEALS AND THINGS ARE GONNA MAKE THIS NUMBER FLUCTUATES ESPECIALLY IF WE PUBLISH THE MAP. BUT IT'S GOT KIND OF WORK SITTING AT PRESENT THIS MAP IS NAPA COUNTY AND IT GIVES YOU A SENSE FOR ALL OF THE PROPERTY TO THE STATE OWNED IN THE COUNTY. YOU'LL NOTICE SOME PARTICULAR CLUSTERING YOU ALSO NOTICE YOU KNOW JUST SORT OF THOSE WITH NO THE COUNTY HOW. IF THE RESERVES ARE PRETTY RURAL AREAS IN SOME CASES THESE ARE MORE URBAN THIS IS THIS IS A SNAPSHOT CAM WE WENT THROUGH WE WERE DEVELOPING THE THIS INVENTORY. THIS NEXT SLIDE IS AN EXAMPLE OF A SITE THAT IS GOING TO BE ON THE US LIST AND WE WOULD SEE ESPECIALLY BIBLE FOR DEVELOPMENT. YOU'LL NOTICE IT'S ACTUALLY THE PARK AREA TO THE NORTH IS THE CAPITAL SO IT IS JUST TO THE SOUTH A COUPLE HERE. HERE IN SACRAMENTO IT'S A DTS OWN SITE ACTUALLY. TRY TO BE POTENTIALLY GO FORWARD AS A DEVELOPMENT. BUT IT'S NOT A BIG. FORTY ACRE SITE IN THE MIDDLE OF AN URBAN AREA IT'S SMALLER SITE. THE EXECUTIVE ORDER DOES CALL OUT BIG DEVELOPMENTS IN A CALLS OUT SMALL DEVELOPMENTS THIS MIGHT BE A FORTY MICRO UNIT SITES. THAT COULD BE A DIVERSE AND AFFORDABLE WERE LOOKING AT EVERYTHING UNDER THE SUN AND NOT. PUTTING OURSELVES JUST TO YOU KNOW THE BIG STUFF. SO I'M SURE YOU WANT TO KNOW KIND OF HOW WE SCREEN THE SITES AND FOR THAT SUCH AS GOING TO KIND OF WALK ADDRESS. IT MORNING YES. PLEASE INTRODUCE FOR YOU KNOW HE'S YOUR GOOD JASON KENNEY DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF REAL ESTATE SERVICES DIVISION DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES THANK YOU FOR THAT REPORT AND WE HAVE SASHA WOOD WITH SAKE THE DATA RESEARCH MANAGER FOR HOUSING-POLICY AT DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING COMMITTEE DEVELOPMENT THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE THANK YOU GOOD MORNING SAYS JASON DESCRIBED IT'S BEEN A PRETTY RAPID PROCESS SINCE THE GOVERNOR SIGNED THE EXECUTIVE ORDER AND AS WE DEVELOP SCREENING CRITERIA DECENT ALLUDED TO THIS BUT WE WERE BOTH TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE HOUSING IS MOST NEEDED. AND WORST PARTICULAR SITES MIGHT BE MORE ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE THAN OTHERS AGAIN EMPHASIZING WHAT JASON SAID WE WEREN'T SAYING NO TO SITES BUT JUST TRYING TO IDENTIFY WHAT OUR PRIORITIES MIGHT BE GIVEN THESE FACTORS SO IN THIS VITAL TALK THROUGH. BOTH THE HOUSING NEED CRITERIA AND THE ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY. SO WE THREE MEASURES TO IDENTIFY WHERE HOUSING IS MOST NEEDED AND IMPACTFUL AND ACTUALLY RIFFS ON SOME OF THE THINGS THAT SENATOR DODD MENTIONED AT THE START IN THE INTRODUCTION. SO ALL COVER THOSE NOW. THE FIRST THE AVAILABILITY OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND THAT'S ADDRESSING THE AVAILABILITY OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE JOB AND COMMUTERS SHEDS TO REALLY TRYING TO ADDRESS THOSE HOUSEHOLDS THAT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO FIND. HOMES THAT ARE CLOSE TO WHERE THEY'RE WORKING. TO MEASURE THAT WE LOOK AT WHERE THE SHORTFALL IN UNITS THAT ARE RENTED AT A LEVEL AFFORDABLE TO VERY LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. ART IS GREATER THAN 30% OF THE NUMBER OF FEEL I HOUSE OF NUMBER OF VERY LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS EXCUSE ME. TO REALLY TRYING TO LOOK AT WHERE THERE'S A GAP BETWEEN AVAILABLE HOUSING FOR FOLKS THAT REALLY NEED IT. WHO ARE WORKING UBER HOODS AND WHERE DOES NOT EXIST. THAT MEASURE ALONG WITH EVERYTHING ELSE IS PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATA SO WE'RE NOT TRYING TO USE PROPRIETARY DATA HERE. WE ALSO LOOK AT THE GAP BETWEEN SUPPLY AND DEMAND AND SPECIFICALLY WHERE THE GAP BETWEEN THE REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT OR THE RINA. AND BUILDING PERMITS ISSUED WHERE THAT GAP IS GREATER THAN FIFTEEN HUNDRED PERMITS SO WHERE THE JURISDICTION IS NOT PRODUCING. UP TO THEIR PLANNING GOALS. AND THIRD WE ALSO LOOK AT THE RATE OF INCREASE AND RENTS. SPECIFICALLY WHERE THE MEDIAN GROSS RENT INCREASED BY MORE THAN 5% IN A YEAR OVER YEAR BASIS SO RULING LOOKING AT WHERE THERE'S- ACTIVE PRESSURE. IN THE RENTAL MARKET AND AFFORDABILITY IS DIMINISHING. TO LOOK AT SPECIFIC SITES WE- ALSO EXAMINE ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY MEASURES AND HERE WE USE SEVERAL MEASURES TO EVALUATED DEFERRED AT THE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT WOULD BE FEASIBLE. AND NAMELY WE BUILD ON THAT TGS ANALYSIS THAT DECENT DESCRIBED AT THE START SO BEFORE WE EVEN GET TO THINKING ABOUT WHAT TYPES OF ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY THERE MAY BE IF A SITE IS GRADED VERTICALLY WE KNOW IT WILL BE VERY EXPENSIVE IF NOT IT IMPOSSIBLE TO DEVELOP THEIR SO IN THAT WAY OUR ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY MODEL REALLY BUILT OFF OF THE ANALYSIS THAT JASON'S TEAM LEAD. FURTHER WE LOOK AT PROXIMITY TO JOB CENTERS THREE LOOKING AT CENSUS TRACKS WHERE THE NUMBER OF JOBS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE WITH LESS THAN A BE A- BOMB AND THAT FALL WITHIN A GIVEN RADIUS. ARE NOT REALLY MEETING THE NEEDS OF THOSE FOLKS THAT ARE WORKING THERE. TO DO THIS WE USE THAT EACH CITY ANTI CáC OPPORTUNITY MAPS AND WE'RE LOOKING AT THE TOP TWO QUINTILES. WE ALSO LOOK AT PROXIMITY THE EDUCATION. AGAIN MENTIONING SOME OF THE FACTORS THAT YOU DESCRIBED. WE LOOK AT CENSUS TRACKS FOR THE EDUCATION COMPOSITE INDICATOR IS WITHIN THE TOP TWO QUINTILES STATEWIDE SO MAKING SURE THAT IF. THESE SITES ARE IN AREAS OF OPPORTUNITY THERE'S ALSO GOING TO BE HI OPPORTUNITY EDUCATION I'M THERE FOR THE HOUSEHOLDS. WE ALSO LOOK AT PROXIMITY TO HIGH FREQUENCY PUBLIC TRANSIT. AND ANY AREA WITHIN THE STATE THAT IS WITHIN HALF A MILE OF HIGH FREQUENCY PUBLIC TRANSIT STOPS. SO WITH THOSE FACTORS WE CAN THEN START TO MEASURE HOW EACH ONE OF THE SITES ARE STACKING UP. AND A SITE MAY BE IN AN AREA WITH HIGH HOUSING NEED OR MODERATE HOUSING NEED. AT A PARTICULAR SITE MAY BE HITTING ON EACH ONE OF THOSE THREE ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY FACTORSWERE NINE. AGAIN NOT TO BE SCRIPT PRESCRIPTIVE BUT JUST TO SHOW THAT THESE SITES IF THEY'RE MEETING ON THOSE ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY FACTORS. THEY MAY BE MORE COMPETITIVE FOR TAX CREDITS AND OTHER A FIND AFFORDABLE HOUSING FINANCE THAT'S AVAILABLE. AWESOME TWO IN TERMS OF THE DEVELOPMENT APPROACH. THE FIRST BILL POINT STATE DEVELOPMENTS BUT I THINK IT'S A GOOD TIME TO KIND OF HIGHLIGHT THE WAY THIS IS BEING APPROACH TYPICALLY WITH THE LOCALS AT THE END THE DAY WE FOUND THE TICKET MORE TAXES WITH COMING UP WITH IN TOURING THAT INVENTORY IS DONE IT'LL BE PUBLISHED AND WHAT THAT REALLY SHOWS IS THESE ARE THE SITES THE STATUS SAID. WE COULD SEE DEVELOP AS HOUSING IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT EVERY SINGLE ON THE SITES ARE YOU KNOW THE BILL POLL IT MAY BE THAT THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT LOCAL CONCERNS IT MAY BE THAT THERE ARE THINGS THAT MAKE THEM MORE OR LESS DIFFICULT TO DEVELOPE THAT WE'RE NOT AWARE OF STILL THE LOCAL LEVEL IT MAY BE THAT ALL THE SITES ARE GOOD BUT THERE ARE SOME SITES THAT ARE BETTER OR WORSE THAN OTHERS. THE NUMBER OF PLACES WHERE I THINK. NICE THAT OUR LIST AS A GOES OUT IS REALLY SORT OF STATE INVENTORY PROPERTY AND THEN THE NEXT SET OF THIS REALLY BIG IS WORKING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO IDENTIFY WHERE WE SHOULD BE PRIORITIZING DEVELOPMENTS OBVIOUSLY WORKED BECAUSE THE COMMITTED LINE THERE'S GONNA BE SOME PRIVATIZATION IS HAPPENING EARLY ON AND WHERE WE ARE WE ARE WORKING WITH LOCALS ON THAT BUT ONCE NOT GOES PUBLIC I THINK THAT'S WHEN WE EXPECT THE MORE VOLUMINOUS CONVERSATIONS TO HAPPEN ABOUT PARTICULAR. SITES PARTICULAR LIABILITIES PARTICULAR USES. SO FAR THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS THERE HAVE BEEN QUITE A FEW LOCAL ENTITIES CITY AND COUNTY LEVEL. AS WELL AS PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS WHO REACHED OUT SOME OF COME THROUGH MEMBERS SOME OF COME THROUGH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE SOME COME THROUGH CONSULTANT SOME OF COME TO US DIRECTLY. AND WE'VE WE'VE HAD THE SAME MESSAGE TO ALL OF THEM ALL THE MAP IS COMING IF YOU'VE GOT SITES HERE WHERE OF PLEASE LET US KNOW. AS ENTITIES HAVE PROPOSED SITES WITH ACTUALLY EVEN IF WE'VE SCREEN THEM OUT WE ADDED THEM TO LIST AND WENT TO THE APARTMENTS INVENTED OUR GOAL. STATE AND WE FIND THAT THE LOCAL INPUT THAT PROCESS IS GOING TO BE INVALUABLE. AT THE SAME POINT TIME EVEN THOUGH THE OUR STATE DEVELOPMENTS THERE STILL AN ABSOLUTE LOCAL CONNECTIVITY THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN YOU AT A MINIMUM WATER SEWER GAS THINGS-LIKE THAT AND SO. YOU KNOW THE PARTNERSHIP WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CAN BE CRITICAL WE ALSO AGREED RECOGNIZE THAT WE ARE IN A DEARTH OF LOCAL INFORMATION KEEPING WITH LOCAL AGAIN HOPEFULLY. STOCK TO REPETITIVE BUT WE RECOGNIZE THAT WE DON'T KNOW NECESSARILY THAT TINA TWO BLOCKS DOWN THE STREET THERE WAS A DEVELOPMENT THAT WAS PLAN PROPOSED IN IT. IT FIT DIETER FAILED FOR REASONS ACT WIRES THE THOSE LESSONS LEARNED HOW TO AVOID THOSE ISSUES WEEK WE RECOGNIZE WE DON'T KNOW THAT AND- YOU KNOW PICK UP PICK A RANDOM STREET AND ANY PICKLER YOU KNOW JURISDICTION IN THE STATE SO. I THINK THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND THOSE LESSONS LEARNED ARE GOING TO BE ABSOLUTELY INVALUABLE AND WE- EXECUTIVE ORDER HIGHLIGHTS AND WE ARE EXPECTING TO. HAVE A ROBUST. PARTNERSHIP LOCAL GOVERNMENTS YOU KNOW ONCE THE ONCE THE MAP GOES OUT. THAT SAID THE APPROACH IN THE EXECUTIVE ORDERS PRETTY SIMPLE YOU KNOW ASIDE FROM LEVERAGING EXISTING SURPLUS PROPERTY. WHICH I'LL TALK ABOUT IN LAST LIED WE WILL BE FOCUSING ON LONG TERM GROUND LEASES. WE HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO ENTER INTO LEASES UP TO UP QUITE A LONG TERM WE CAN GO NINE NINE YEARS HE WANTED TO. WAIVERS CAN BE BEST ALTERNATELY FOR THAT DEVELOPMENT AND BY ABILITY WE CAN LEVERAGE STATE PROPERTY VALUES WE DO NOT HAVE TO LISA FOR MARKET VALUE FOR THE PROPERTY ITSELF. IN THAT WAY WE CAN WE CONTRIVE THE- POTENTIAL FOR DEVELOPMENT. PLEASE GIVE ORDER DOES CALL OUT IN A BIT OF CONSTRUCTION SO AGAIN THESE ARE NOT YOUR TYPICAL DEVELOPMENTS WITH A DIESEL HAVE TO BE. WELL THAT'S MASS TIMBER MODULAR UNITS PREFABRICATION MICRO UNITS WE'RE LOOKING AT AS MANY INNOVATIVE WAYS TO BUILD HOUSING AS POSSIBLE. THERE'S ALSO HIGHLIGHTS EXECUTIVE ORDER BY DOING THIS IN A VERY SUSTAINABLE WAY AND COST EFFECTIVELY SUSTAINABLE WAY. AND THEN DOING IT IN AN EQUITABLE WAY WHETHER THAT'S FAILING WAGE OR ARE FOCUSING ON WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AS WELL. AND THEN FINALLY I THINK A COUPLE OTHER HIGHLIGHTS THAT WITH MENTIONING. THE SECOND ORDER ALSO DOES CALL OUT LAND SWAPS I MENTION ONE EXAMPLE EARLIER. AND THERE'S LIMITED. EXISTING AUTHORITY TO THAT BUT WHERE POSSIBLE WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT. ROLE OF MAYBE OUR SITE IS IN GREAT FOR HOUSING. BE GREAT FOR SOME ALTERNATE USE IF THE CITY OR COUNTY HAD A- SO WE COULD SWAP AND ONE GOES HOUSING ONE GOES WHERE THEY ALTERNATE USES WERE OPEN TO THOSE TYPES OF ARRANGEMENTS AS WELL. WERE ALSO OPEN TO CO DEVELOPMENTS ONE PARTICULAR CITY REACHED OUT DURING THE PROCESS THERE WAS A PARTIAL THAT WE HAD THAT WAS VERY IRREGULAR SHAPED IT REALLY WOULD NOT HAVE WORKED FOR HOUSING HOWEVER THEY OWN THE TWO ADJACENT PARCELS AND AS A CODE DEVELOPMENT IT'S- ACTUALLY VERY VERY VIABLE. AND SO LOOKING AT THOSE CONVERSATIONS WITH A LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AS WELL WE'VE BEEN VERY PLEASED TO KIND OF SEE SOME VERY INNOVATIVE IDEAS. SECOND TO LAST EXISTING SURPLUS SO ONE OF THE CHALLENGES HISTORICALLY WITH US A PROPERTY IS. AFTER DECLARE SURPLUS IN SOME CASES PROPERTY SETS. IT'S FOR NUMBER OF REASONS. BUT IN SOME CASES IT'S BECAUSE OF POTENTIAL STATE WE USE AND. BALLOTS THAT'S A BIG REASON WHY AND SO THE EXECUTIVE ORDER THE VETTING PROCESS THERE WERE QUITE A FEW DEPARTMENTS WOULD PROPERTIES WHO HAD BEEN YOU KNOW VACILLATING ON POTENTIALLY REDUCE THEIR PROPERTY THE FUTUREWHO SAID NO WE'RE FINE WITH ALTERNATELY DIVESTING OF THIS AND SO THERE ARE SOME SIGNIFICANT SURPLUS PROPERTIES ACROSS THE STATE THAT HAVE BEEN. SHAKEN LOOSE AS WELL THROUGHOUT THIS AND I THINK THE LAST POINT IS THE OTHERS THERE'S A MENTION EXECUTIVE ORDER ON YOU'RE PRIORITIZING FUNDING AS WELL FOR THE EFFORT SO I THINK ALL OF OUR- YOU KNOW THE IF THE AUTHORITIES ARE THERE THE WILLINGNESS IS THERE AT THE DEPARTMENTS HAVE BEEN GREAT AND GIVING UP. PROPERTIES THAT THEY DO NOT NEED ANYMORE SO FAR ARE ENGAGING WITH THE LOCALS HAVE BEEN HAVE BEEN REALLY ENCOURAGING AND REFRESHING AND WERE ABOUT THAT. STAGE WILL PUBLISH THE MAP AND BEGIN THE ACTUAL ART PIECE. SO THAT WAS A LOT I KNOW SHE GOT QUESTIONS. AND THEN WE CAN ANSWER FOR YOU GUYS. PROCEED TO REPORT ANY QUESTIONS FIRST CENTER BRADFORD FIRST AND I APOLOGIZE MISTER KING I WAS IN AND OUT DURING YOUR PRESENTATION BUT DID YOU SAY AT WHAT POINT WOULD YOU HAVE ALL THE SITES IDENTIFIED IN THE MAP FINALIZED THE HEAT MAP RELEASE WE HAD SAID A FEW MONTHS BACK COULD BE THE SUMMER OF TWENTY NINETEEN. SO WE EXPECTED BE FAIRLY IMMINENT OKAY. SENATE NIELSEN AND IS THERE A FOCUSED ON. HOUSING TO BE AVAILABLE THEN FOR THE HOMELESS OR THIS JUST IN GENERAL HOUSING PERIOD FOR ANYBODY WE ARE LOOKING AT HOUSING MORE IN GENERAL AT ALL RANGES FROM VERY LOW AFFORDABILITY ALL WITH THE WORK FORCE IT'S IT REALLY WILL DEPEND ON THE AREA AND THE SITES AND WHAT THE BIBLE BUT- WE'RE NOT. NECESSARILY SHUTTING OFF ANY THE DOORS. HOW ABOUT IN HIGH COST COUNTIES LIKE MARIN FOR EXAMPLE. WHAT CAN WE DO IN A COUNTY THAT HIGH COST SO LET'S THAT GOES BACK TO LEVERAGING STATE PROPERTY VALUES YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT WE'VE GOT PROPERTY IN SOME AREAS THAT SELLS FOR THREE MILLION DOLLARS AN ACRE AND SO BEING ABLE TO LEVERAGE A LONG TERM LEASE MAYBE FIFTY YEARS FOR A DOLLAR AND BEING ABLE TO DRIVE DOWN THE COST FOR CONSTRUCTION THERE IS A HUGE WIN WE CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THE AFFORDABLE. DEVELOPMENT. WELL ONE OF THE ISSUE. OBVIOUSLY HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS HAVE TO FACTOR INTO THIS BECAUSE WE'RE LOOKING FOR HOUSING FOR CALIFORNIANS WHO NEED HOUSING. AND AS TO THE COST OF HOUSING. THERE ARE MANY DRIVING FACTORS BUT HAVE YOU LOOKED AT ANY OF THOSE DRIVING FACTORS AND THINGS THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN DO TO. HOLD BACKSOME OF THE COST FACTORS THAT HAVE BEEN DRIVEN BY VARIOUS THINGS STATE POLICY. LOCAL POLICY PLANNING AT CENTER. EXECUTIVE ORDER HAS US WORKING LARGELY WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF EXISTING STATUTE THE WAY IT WAS WRITTEN EMPHASIZES ALTERNATE DEVELOPMENTS THAT CAN BE CHEAPER WHETHER THAT SUCH TINY HOW DEVELOPMENTS A SHIPPING CONTAINER DEVELOPMENT USING UP OTHER FORMS OF PRE FAB OR OR MODULAR CONSTRUCTION. TIMBER ACTUALLY CAN BE FOR LEGAL CLUB ON EXPENSIVE EXPENSIVE TO BUILD SO WE HAVE LOOKED AT WAYS WITHIN THE EXISTING FRAMEWORK OF PURSUING MORE COST EFFECTIVE HOUSING BUT NOW WE HAVEN'T. SILLY PROPOSE ANYTHING THAT WOULD CHANGE THAT FRAMEWORK. AND I JUST OFFER THAT BEING ABLE TO DISCOUNT THE LAND VALUE AND ENDS UP BEING A HUGE DRIVER AND MAKING AFFORDABLE HOUSING POSSIBLE AND FEASIBLE. IN HIGH COST AREAS AND WHILE THIS WOULD BE A NEW ENDEAVOR FOR THE STATE IT'S A VERY COMMON ENDEAVOR FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING FINANCE TO HAVE PUBLIC AGENCIES. BY THE LOW COST LONG TERM GROUND LEASES AND SERVING ALMOST AS FIRST IN ACQUISITION FUNDING. AND SO IN THIS WAY THE STATUS SETTING AN EXAMPLE AND ALSO FOLLOWING I'M PRETTY ESTABLISHED PRACTICE IN THIS REGARD. FOCUSED JUST ON STATE PROPERTIES HAVE YOU LOOKED INTO NO PRIVATE NON PROFITS THAT HAVE DONE THINGS. CALIFORNIAN THE DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION FOR EXAMPLE IN. MAHAL PIES AND DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE THAT OR IS THAT A PART OF YOUR INVENTORY OR NOT. ARMENDARIZ FOCUS THE LANDS THAT WE THE STATE OWNS AND CONTROLS WE HAVE THAT WE HAVE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH SOME NONPROFIT AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS IN TERMS OF APPROACH XIN YOU KNOW CONCEPT% AND THINGS LIKE THAT WE FULLY EXPECT ONCE THE MAP GOES PUBLIC THAT THERE WILL BE THOSE SORTS OF CONVERSATIONS THAT HAPPENED. WE WOULD WELCOME THOSE CONVERSATIONS HAPPENING BUT RIGHT NOW OUR FOCUS HAS BEEN THAT THE PROPERTY THAT THE STATE OWNS WELL I WOULD SUGGEST IT BE WELL TO TAKE A LOOK. AT THE NATURE OF THE TO THE- ELATION YOU'RE GOING TO TRY TO PROVIDE IT FOR. AND IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CHALLENGED POPULATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE HOMELESS HARD CORE LONG TERM HOMELESS. WE'RE GLAD TO LOOK A HOUSING IN AREAS WHERE THERE ARE WOULD BE RESOURCES TO SERVE THAT POPULATION. LIKE REHABILITATIVE RESOURCES FOR THEM. THAT THERE WOULD BE GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT THAT THERE WOULD BE CAREER TECH. OPPORTUNITIES ARE THOSE FACTORS THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE ABLE TO THE EXTENT THAT WERE YOU KNOW LOOKING AT SITE FEASIBILITY AND LOOKING AT ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY WE ARE LOOKING FOR THE AVAILABILITY OF JOBS THAT FOLKS WITH LESS THAN A BACHELOR'S DEGREE COULD PERCEIVE SO WE'RE NOT ONLY LOOKING FOR YOU KNOW. HI I'M COME EARNING JOBS BUT FOR A RANGE AND WE'RE LOOKING TO WHERE THERE'S TREMENDOUS NEED WHERE THERE'S NOT ENOUGH HOUSING FOR PEOPLE THAT ALREADY HAVE JOBS IN THIS HIGH COST AREAS SO WE'RE WE'RE DOING THAT THROUGH THE SITE ANALYSIS AND THEN IT ALSO SEE THAT THROUGH THE REAL ESTATE CONSULTANT WORKING THROUGH OUR PROPERTY DUE DILIGENCE WILL BE DOING TRADITIONAL THINGS THAT ANY REAL ESTATE DEVELOPER WOULD BE DOING. INCLUDING A MARKET ANALYSIS NEVER CONSIDERING PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT WE WOULD ALSO BE DOING A SCANNED FOR THE TYPES OF RESOURCES AND OTHERS THAT YOU DESCRIBED. THANK YOU WELCOME. WELL HE KIND OF. THANK YOU THIS IS REALLY GOING TO DISCUSS WHAT HE JUST ALREADY SHARED BECAUSE I WAS LOOKING AT THE CURRENT STATE OF HOUSING AFFORDABILITY IN CALIFORNIA THE REPORT THAT CAME ON IT TALKED ABOUT VERY STRATEGIC PROGRAMMATIC APPROACH TO THE HOUSING CRISIS BUT HE KINDA. DISCUSS WHAT I WAS GONNA SHARE AND WANTED A HOUSE BUT THANK YOU FOR SHARING AND THAT WAS YOU KNOW ARE WE GONNA MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS NOT RESOURCES AVAILABLE AROUND THIS HOUSING BY THINK I THINKING IMAGE ANSWER THAT FOR ME ON THE OTHER THING THAT I'D ADD IS THAT WE KNOW WE ARE REALLY LOOKING FOR THESE PROPERTIES TO WHAT TYPE OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS MIGHT THEY PROVIDE. AND SO I WOULD SAY THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF IDEAS WERE REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING THE CREATIVITY THAT RESPONDENTS WILL BRING TO THE R. F. P. ABOUT WHAT TYPES OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS THESE PROPERTIES MIGHT BE ABLE TO OFFER. THANK YOU SENATOR ALAN. YEAH THE ONE I KNOW THAT OUR NEXT PANELS CAN BE FOCUSED ON THIS BUT SINCE YOU'RE HERE AND PROVIDING YOUR PERSPECTIVE FROM THE GOVERNMENT SIDE WOULD LOVE TO GET YOUR SENSE OF THE INTERACTION SO FAR AND YOUR ANTICIPATION OF INTERACTION SO FAR WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND ANY OF YOU KNOW LOTS OF DIFFERENT ABSOLUTE GOVERNMENT'S VERY DIFFERENT ATTITUDES ABOUT. HOUSING. IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S ALREADY BEEN SOME REALLY FRUITFUL INTERACTION AND SINCE SYNERGISTIC ENGAGEMENT. YOU CAN CAN YOU WALK US THROUGH SOME OF THE- SOME OF THE OPPORTUNITIES THE CHALLENGES ARE HAVE THERE BEEN SOME AREAS WHERE YOU'RE REALLY ANTICIPATING A LOT OF PUSH BACK. YOU GIVEN GIVEN THE AND COMMUNITY CONCERNS MIGHT BE OUT THERE ABOUT ABOUT HOUSING. LOVE TO WALK THROUGH SOME OF THE- ACTRESS POLITICS IN OPPORTUNITIES EXISTING I'LL DO MY BEST SO YEAH I THINK THERE'S ALWAYS THE POTENTIAL THAT YOU KNOW A SITE THAT LOOKS REALLY GOOD FOR DEVELOPMENTS MIGHT HAVE SOME LOCAL ON PALATABILITY WE WOULD NECESSARILY NO WE DON'T KNOW AND SO THAT THAT IT'S ALWAYS A POTENTIAL RISK OR AN ISSUE INSOFAR AS WE ARE AWARE OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW WE LIKE THOSE SITES AND HAVE PROACTIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. WE'VE GOT SO LIKE SO AS I MENTIONED EARLIER A LOT OF THE COMIC CON CONVERSATIONS IT HAPPENED HAVE BEEN DISTILLED FACILITATED. THROUGH VARIOUS MEANS WE PROBABLY INTERACTED WITH SAY. TWO DOZEN OR SO DIFFERENT LOCAL ENTITIES SO MORE POPULOUS ENTITIES. IN TERMS OF OUR SITES THEMSELVES AND IT WE'VE WE'VE WE'VE BEEN VERY CLEAR EVERYBODY WE CAN'T DISCLOSE SITE EXOR WIRES THE BECAUSE YOU KNOW BE PAYING WHEN THESE GUYS REACHED OUT WE MAY HAVE GOTTEN A YES FOR THE DEPARTMENT YET SO WE'VE BEEN PRIMARILY INTERACTING AROUND SITES THAT THEY THEMSELVES HAVE SAID WE'VE BEEN EYEING THIS SITE IN OUR JURISDICTION THE LAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS. NOTHING'S BEING DONE WITH IT TORE IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S UNDER UTILIZED OR THEY COULD DO SOMETHING ELSE WITH IT AND SO. THOSE HAVE BEEN THAT THE PRIMARY NATURE THE INTERACTIONS WITH THE LOCALS. WE EXPECT. PUBLISHING OF THE HEAT MAP TO CHANGE THAT DYNAMIC WE EXPECT THERE TO BE AN INFLUX OF. OF MORE OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS BOTH LOOK AMENITIES AND FOR MEMBERS WE ALSO EXPECT. TO BEGIN THE MORE FORMALIZED OUT REACHED WITH THEM WITH THEM ABOUT OUR PARTICULAR SITES. TRYING TO GATHER LESSONS LEARNED WE PLAN ON DOING THAT IN A WAY THAT IS STILL SORT OF PRIORITIZE WORKLOAD PERSPECTIVE SO. ENOUGH SITE MIGHT BE YOU KNOW CHARGE SEVEN. IT PROBABLY WON'T HAVE THE SAME LEVEL CONVERSATION THAT I TRUMP'S ONE OR TWO SITE IS GOING TO HAVE. AT LEAST IN THE BEGINNING. WE HAVE AND I KNOW IN THEIR NUMBERS CAN I COME UP IN A MINUTE BUT WE'VE ALSO. HAD SOME THROUGH CONVERSATIONS WITH THE LEAGUE OF CITIES AS WELL. WE HAVE SOME TENTATIVE PLANS TO DO A WEAPON. ARE TO THE MEMBERS FOR EXAMPLE UPON THE RELEASE OF THE MAP. OUR GOAL TO MILLIONS TO GET THE WORD OUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE HEAT MAP ITSELF IS FUNCTIONAL USABLE NOT JUST FROM. OUR PERSPECTIVE BUT ALSO FROM LOCAL DEVELOPERS AND LOCAL LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AS WELL. SO IT'S BEEN VERY FOCUSED CONVERSATIONS WITH THE LOCALS AND I THINK THE TENOR AND TONE OF THAT WILL CHANGE ONCE THE MAP IS OUT AND- WEBER TALK ABOUT SPECIFIC PROPERTIES AND ISSUES AND THEY HAVE. BUT IT'S BEEN ACTIVE IN SURPRISINGLY. FRUITFUL AND NO CONCERNS BEEN RAISED SO FAR NO. NO REAL ISSUES WITH ANY LOOK OF AGENCY HAVE COME UP. CAN YOU GIVE ME A SENSE OF HOW MUCH. COERCIVE POWER THE STATE HAS. WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE EXECUTIVE ORDER. AND HOW YEAH WHAT WAS IS THIS IS THIS IS THE TRUE REALLY TERM EARLY VOLUNTARY PARTNERSHIP THING OR IT OR IS THERE A BIT OF A STICK ASSOCIATED I THINK THAT THE BEST REVENGE THE QUESTION IS. IS IT'S REALLY COMPLICATED. THIRD EVERYTHING FROM YOU KNOW ALL ALL TAKE OFF A COUPLE OF THINGS ONE YOU KNOW EVEN EVEN IF THE STATE COULD COME IN AND SAY YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE DROPPING A UNIT REGULARS PROPERTY NO ONE CAN GAINS THAT WE STILL HAVE TO CONNECT TO LOCAL POWER WATER SEWER GASES THOSE CONVERSATIONS HAPPEN NO MATTER WHAT AND THEN. AND THEN SEE WHAT PLAYS INTO THINGS AS WELL. ANOTHER SOME THERE'S SOME HOUSING EXEMPTIONS FOR SEQUEL BUT THOSE ARE SPECIFICIT DOES REQUIRE YOU KNOW BY PRESENTING A SOURCE ULTIMATELY AND SO THERE'S A NUMBER OF A VARIETY OF CONVERSATIONS THAT THERE'S NO. THERE'S NO WAY I THINK FOR THE STATE TO COME IN AND JUST. KIND OF BUSINESS TABLES THEY WERE PUTTING SOMETHING THERE WITHOUT SOME DEGREE OF INVOLVEMENT OUR PREFERENCE OBVIOUSLY EVER TALK ABOUT PRIORITIZING SITES YOU KNOW GOING BACK TO BEEN DIAGRAM. THERE'S THE FOLKS WHO WHO ARE OKAY WITH IT THANKS TO ONE OF THE FOLKS ARE SUPPORTIVE OF IT. I THINK YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF SPEEDING GETTING SITES OUT WE'RE OBVIOUSLY CAN BE PARTNERING WITH THOSE ENTITIES WHO WERE HOUSING IS NEEDED WHERE TO GET A GOOD SITE AND WHERE THEY ARE SUPPORTIVE AND ENGAGED THOSE ARE THE ONES I THINK THEY'RE GONNA GET. THE EARLIEST DEVELOPMENTS COME OUT. BUT BEYOND THAT YEAH WE- THE THAT THE QUEEN OF THE STATE ISN'T SUBJECT TO. YOU KNOW. LOCAL ZONING AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO. WHILE WE ARE NOT CITIES OF THOSE THINGS OUR FOCUS HAS BEEN WE ONE HAVE AN ACTIVE PARTNERSHIP BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S- THERE REALLY IS A TIE BETWEEN WHAT WE'RE DOING AND THE COMMITTEE WERE BUILDING HOUSING. IN SOMEONE'S BACKYARD WE RECOGNIZE THAT AND WANT TO BE. WILL BE GOOD NEIGHBORS. AND ARE YOU LOOKING FOR LEGISLATION THAT MIGHT ASSIST WITH. GETTING THESE. PROJECTS OUT FASTER THERE HASN'T BEEN ANY CONVERSATION ABOUT POTENTIAL LEGISLATION. OKAY OBVIOUSLY WILL BE INTERESTED IN AND THAT AND I THINK YEAH I MEAN I THINK EVERYBODY. IS LOOKING FOR WAYS TO. BIG EXPAND OUR HOUSING STOCK AND IN DOING SO IN A WAY THAT'S. BOTH RESPECTFUL OF LOCALS WHILE ALSO UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T. BM MEET EVERY CONCERN THAT MIGHT BE THERE AT A LOCAL WINE AND ARE YOU WANTED ADDED YEAH I JUST SAY THAT FOR SOME OF THE JURISDICTIONS THAT ALREADY STEPPED FORWARD AND DESCRIBE THEIR WILLINGNESS THERE DEMONSTRATING THAT IN A FEW DIFFERENT WAYS THEY MAY BE EXAMINING WHAT KIND OF LOCAL FUNDING THEY HAVE AVAILABLE TO COMMIT TO THE DEAL WHETHER THAT'S FROM THE LOCAL JURISDICTION ITSELF FOR FROM THE LOCAL HOUSING AUTHORITY. SO THEY'RE EXPLORING THOSE THINGS THEY'RE ALSO THINKING ABOUT WHAT THEIR PERMIT PROCESSES GENERALLY AND WHILE IT MIGHT NOT APPLY STRICTLY HERE THEY pMAY HAVE A LOCAL LIAISON THAT COULD REALLY HELP FACILITATE SOME OF THE COMMUNITY OUTREACH FACILITATE ANY OF THE DISCUSSIONS WITH LOCAL PUBLIC WORKS AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO THOSE. ARE GOOD DEMONSTRATIONS OF WILLINGNESS BEYOND JUST STATING CELL RIGHT BUT REALLY SHOWING THAT THEY ARE BEING INTROSPECTIVE AND HOW THEY CAN CONTINUE TO FACILITATE THIS PARTNERSHIP. MIGHT BE SOME OTHER QUALITATIVE THINGS THAT WE WOULD LOOK FOR MYSELF FOR ONE FINAL QUESTION WHAT CAN YOU GIVE US A SENSE OF WHAT SORT OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS ARE BEING TAKEN IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS HOUSING. YOU KNOW LEAD CERTIFICATION AND YOU KNOW OTHER AT BEST PRACTICES GIVEN OUR. OUR OTHER KIND OF BROADER SUSTAINABILITY GOALS AS A STATE. YEAH I MEAN I THINK. WE WILL BE ENCOURAGING DEVELOPERS TO. ALONG THOSE LINES. OTHER THERE'S YOU KNOW A EXISTING EXECUTIVE ORDERS THAT GENTLY GOVERN HOW WE BUILD THINGS IN THE STATE IS THE OLD EXECUTIVE ORDER REQUIRES THE SILVER FOR EXAMPLE THE MINIMUM. WE'RE STILL DOING THE ANALYSIS TO SEE YOU KNOW WHETHER THOSE THINGS. APPLY ULTIMATELY TO THE SORT OF DEVELOPER LET PROPOSALS. BUT EXECUTIVE ORDER IS PRETTY CLEAR AND DIRECTING US TO SCORE FAVORABLY THOSE WHO TO FOCUS ON AND MORE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. THAT'S I THINK BOTH THE MATERIALITY AS AN APPROACH AND APPROACHES SO THAT'S AIMING AT CARBON NEUTRALITY THROUGH. ELECTRIFICATION WHETHER THAT'S YOU KNOW INSTALLATION OF SELECT PANELS VERSES AN OFFSITE BPA MILL ALL ALL THOSE THINGS ARE BEING ARE GONNA BE LOOKED AT THE OUR FEES. BUT WE DON'T HAVE AT PRESENT AT LEAST LIKE A MINIMUM SET UP TO SENSIBLE CRITERIA BEYOND WANTING TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS APPROACH CPOS ASSEMBLY. AND IN A COST EFFECTIVE WAY LIKE WE DO WITH THE STATE DEVELOPMENTS. AND THEN I'D ADD THAT A LOT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING FINANCE MECHANISMS DO REQUIRE SOME DEGREE OF CONSIDERATION FOR ENVIRONMENTAL. SUSTAINABILITY WITHIN THE PROPERTY AND THEN FURTHER KIND OF LOOKING AT OPERATIONAL SUSTAINABILITY OR EVEN SUSTAINABILITY OF HOUSEHOLDS THAT ARE LIVING AT THESE PROPERTIES. THIS BECOMES REALLY IMPORTANT OF WHY WE MIGHT CONSIDER LOCATION OF THE PROPERTY SO MAKING SURE THAT IT'S CONNECTED TO TRANSIT NETWORKS. GOOD HIGHER QUALITY TRANSIT AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO REALLY BEING ABLE TO LIMIT THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS BY DECREASING THE AMOUNT OF THE M. T. THAT'S COMING FROM THESE HOUSEHOLDS JUST BY VIRTUE OF HAVING THEM CLOSER TO JOBS CLOSER TO EDUCATION. CLOSER TO TRANSIT WHAT ELSE IF IT'S NOT GOING TO CONTINUE TO TRAFFIC I MEAN THAT THE ALL THE SORTS OF THINGS OF THE KINDS OF THINGS I THINK THAT'LL MAKE DON. CAM COMMUNITIES ON THE GROUND FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE. JUST SO I UNDERSTAND THE PLAN A BASIC MECHANISMS YOU HAVE. BASICALLY A FIND. AND THEN YOU YOU YOU'RE GETTING DEVELOPERS. FUTURE OF MATCHING UP SPACE. WITH A MALE ALL THESE PRODUCTS WILL BE DEVELOPED BY PRIVATE. DEVELOPERS YEAH THE AMBIENT ME ANTI THE INTENTION IS THAT THE STATE BRINGS THE PROPER TO THE TABLE AD WE BRING THE ABILITY TO LEASE AT VERY LOW COST AND LONG TERM DEVELOPERS WOULD COME AND THEY WOULD PROPOSE BE AWARDED IT THEY WOULD BUILD OWN AND OPERATE THE IMPROVEMENTS WITH THE WITH THE FUNDAMENTAL LONG TERM GROUND LEASE TO THEM. SO IT'S ALL OF FOR IT'S A IT'S A I HAD A PERSON FROM HOUSING MINISTER THEREFORE I 2% IT WOULD IT WOULD DEPEND ON THE MARKET ITSELF THE TYPES OF HOUSING SUBSIDIES THAT ARE AVAILABLE HOW THE DEAL PENCILS HOW MUCH ARE PROPERTY VALUE THAT'S US. SOME OF THE PROPERTIES MAY BE ON A PERCENT. OTHERS ARE GOING TO BE MORE TRADITIONAL IN A MARKET FOR ALL MIXES. BUT MORE TRADITIONAL AS IN 10% OF OUR HOUSING. NO I THINK WE COULD WE ARE EXPLORING MIXED INCOME DEVELOPMENTS AND FACT IS THERE A MINIMUM AFFORDABLE HOUSING NOT SPELLED OUT IN THE EXECUTIVE ORDER AND SO I THINK THIS IS MORE THAT WILL EXPLORE WITH THE REAL ESTATE DUE DILIGENCE WHAT CAN THE PROPERTY BY ITSELF SUPPORT WHAT OTHER FINANCING COULD COME IN TO HELP SUPPORT DEEPER AFFORDABILITY. AND SO THAT'S SOME OF THE FACTORS THAT WE DON'T YET KNOW UNTIL WE GET DEEPER INTO THE SITES I'D SAY THAT THERE DOES SEEM TO BE A STRONG FOCUS ON AFFORDABILITY IN EACH SHE BEATS ROLE IN EACH CITY SERVICE OF PROVIDING AFFORDABLE OR LOANS TO CREATE AFFORDABLE HOUSING I THINK THAT THAT IS INTENTIONAL RIGHT SO WILL BE CONSIDERING THE WAYS THAT WE CAN SUPPORT. ON THESE DEVELOPERS AND EXPLORING THE FINANCING OPTION RIGHT MISS HOUSING WINNING TO OUR FIND FINANCING ALONE THIS WAS WHEN YOU'RE GIVING THEM THAT THAT PRETTY CONSIDERABLE GIFT OF. A FREE LAND RIGHT WHICH DOES HELP DISCOUNT IT QUITE A BIT I WOULD THINK SO YEAH BUT YOU KNOW WE HAVE HEARD FROM OTHER LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO THERE'S YOU KNOW SOME LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE LACK OF MODERATE INCOME HOUSING SURE SO SOMETHING LIKE SOME MODERATE UNITS PERHAPS SOME ABOVE MODERATE UNITS COULD HELP OFFSET THE DEEPER AFFORDABILITY AND STILL GET TO VERY LOW SO. THIS IS WHERE WE DON'T WANT TO LIMIT THE CREATIVITY THAT THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING ADVOCACY ORGANIZATIONS MIGHT BE ABLE TO BRING AS THEY. LOOK AT SOME OF THE PROPERTIES THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE. BUT NO NOTHING SPELLED OUT ABOUT SPECIFIC AFFORDABILITY MIXES WITHIN THE L. JUST A ALONG THE LINES OF THAT QUESTION. YEAH THE GOVERNOR I REALLY. APPRECIATE HAVE A PRETTY THE GOVERNOR'S YOU APPROACH TO THAT ARE PROVIDING. OF THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT OUR MEETING. YOU KNOW THE REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS. I GUESS MY CONCERN HERE IS HOW DO WE GO ABOUT WITH THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES. AND NOT CREATE A SIMILAR TYPE OF SITUATION WHERE YOU HAVE THE NIMBIS OR SOMEBODY JUST COMING HERE EVEN WHERE THE STATE'S. GIVEN THESE HOUSING THE GOOD THIS LAND IN. SO I'M I'M INTERESTED IN WHAT THE ENTITLEMENT PROCESS YOU KNOW MY LOOK LIKE IF IT'S PREMATURE ON THAT THAT'S FINE THAT'S THE ACCEPTABLE AT A ANSWER BUT I BUT WHAT I'M HOPING IS THAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO YOU KNOW WORK WITH CITY STAFF EVERYTHING AND NOT. PROVIDE THIS POLITICAL. SOMETIMES DIATRIBE TO DOT MY BACKYARD. AND YOUR WORK CLOSELY WITH THE DEVELOPER THE NONPROFIT COMMUNITY IN THE STATE IN THE IN THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT WITHOUT SETTING UP. THESE MASSIVE PUBLIC HEARINGS TO YOUR WHICH MADE TO SWAY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS I EAT COUNCIL MEMBERS FROM THE SUPPORTING A PROJECT LIKE THAT. YEAH AND TO SALAS POINT I MEAN THERE I THINK THAT'S WHERE THE STATE'S. A LOT OF THAT FACTORS AND I MEAN WE AREN'T SUBJECT TECHNICALLY TO TONING OR PLANNING COMMISSION APPROVALS ARE THOSE SORTS OF THINGS. SEQUEL IN THE LAST MINUTES IT'S VERY MUCH A PUBLIC INPUT PROCESS AND SO YOU KNOW THAT'S THAT'S WHAT THAT'S DESIGNED TO DO IS LIST OF IMPORTANCE OTHER CERTAINLY GONNA BE THAT ELEMENT TO IT. BUT YEAH I MEAN I THINK SOME OF THE THINGS THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS NATURALLY HAVE TO GO THROUGH IN THEIR OWN JURISDICTIONS WE ARE SUBJECT TO AND BEING ABLE TO KIND OF DO THAT IN A COLLABORATIVE WAY WITH THEM THAT STILL. IS NOT TO THE PORTAL TO THE COMMUNITY BUT DOES FOCUS. ON ON DEVELOPMENT IN A RESPONSIBLE WAY IS KIND OF ORACLE. SENATOR RUBIO DID SENATOR NIELSEN THANK YOU. HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT REDEVELOPMENT LAND I KNOW DOWNTOWN A LOT OF LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES PURCHASE AND WITH THE DEVELOPMENT FUNDING AND THEN WHEN IT WENT AWAY HOW SOME OF THE LAND WAS LEFT IN LIMBO. BY WAY OF EXAMPLE I REMEMBER WE HAD A PARCEL WHERE IT WAS REDEVELOPMENT A BOLD SITES VERY SMALL AND THERE WAS A PIECE IN THE CENTER THAT WE'RE GONNA PURCHASE FOR MY PRIVATE OWNER SO THAT WE CAN CONSOLIDATE THE LAN AND CREATE SOMETHING BIG BUT- THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN AND ONE AWAY BUT THOSE TWO PARCELS WERE STILL LEFT. IN LIMBO SO. TO SPEAK CAN YOU SPEAK TO THAT AND HOW ARGUE. GOING TO DETERMINE LIKE FOR EXAMPLE IN THAT CASE I JUST EXPRESS IT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR YOU TO SEE. THAT THAT THERE'S A POTENTIAL THERE BECAUSE THEY'RE TOO SMALL PIECES ARE YOU GOING INTO CITIES AND ASKING FOR INFORMATION FROM PRIOR LAND. HOW WE WOULD INVITE ANY CITY THAT HAS AN INVENTORY AVAILABLE TO CONSIDER HOW THEIR INVENTORY MIGHT ALIGN WITH OURS AND SO I THINK ONCE WE REVEALED A HEAT MAP THAT WILL BE MUCH MORE TRANSPARENT. AND I THINK THERE IS SOME PENDING LEGISLATION KIND OF SPEAKING TO THIS RIGHT NOW THAT ASIDE. WE'LL BE ABLE TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS IN THAT SPECIFIC SCENARIO THAT YOU DESCRIBED IF THE FORMER REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY WANTED TO TALK TO US ABOUT HOW SOME OF OUR SITES MAY BE ADJACENT OR HOW WE MABEL TO BE ABLE TO SWAP OR COMBINED. THOSE ARE THE TYPE-OF CONVERSATIONS THE TREASONS MENTIONING WE EXPECT TO BE HAVING MORE OF I'M WE DO KNOW THAT WHETHER IT'S FORMER REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES LOCALITIES ON ME YOU KNOW CITIES OR COUNTIES. PUBLIC HOUSING AUTHORITIES TRANSIT AGENCIES THERE'S A LOT OF ENTITIES THAT DO HAVE PUBLICLY OWNED LAND THAT MAY FIT THOSE TYPES OF DESCRIPTIONS THAT YOU JUST SHARED SO. WE. LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING HOW THOSE INVENTORIES MY MATCH UP WITH OURS. YEAH I ONLY ADD THAT YEAH UNFORTUNATELY ALL WE ARE AWARE OF ARE THE PROPERTIES AT THE STATE OWNS AND CONTROLS. AND SO THOSE THOSE SYNERGIES WE ARE KIND OF DEPENDENT ON THE LOCALS FROM TO BRING UP AND PARTNER WITH US ON. SO AT THIS POINT WE ARE GOING TO DO OF SOME KIND OF EDUCATIONAL CAMPAIGN SOUL. CITIES TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS A PROCESS THAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH AND THAT THAT INFORMATION WOULD BE VITAL. OKAY THE WHAT WAS THE MAP IS PUBLISHED WE ARE EXPECTING TO DO A SIGNIFICANT ABOUT REACHES BACK THANK YOU. CENTER NIELSEN. HARDING IS AN ISSUE THAT MUST BE. COGNIZANT OF. OVER THE YEARS. BUDGET PARTICULARLY I WATCH THESE AGENCIES HAVE PROPERTIES. ONE H. BERDIRI IMPOSSIBLE SOMETIMES TO GET THE INVENTORY OF WHAT THEY HAVE I KNOW RECENT EFFORTS MADE BY OTHER MEMBERS HERE IN THE LAST TEN YEARS TO GET INFORMATION FROM AGENCIES ABOUT WHAT PROPERTY THEY HAVE THAT IS ACCESS BUT WE DON'T HAVE ANY DATA. I WOULD ASSUME THAT IT IS GETTING BETTER OF THESE AGENCIES BEING FORCED TO OR A REWARDED IF THEY'LL BE COMING FORTH I MEAN THERE HAS TO BE AN ACCOUNTABILITY BECAUSE AGENCIES HISTORICALLY DON'T WANT TO JUST PUT STUFF OUT ON THE TABLE WE ALWAYS MAY NEED THAT FIFTEEN YEARS FROM NOW. SO THAT'S THAT'S KIND OF WHY THIS EXECUTIVE ORDER I THINK IS SO GROUND BREAKING INTO THE- THERE IS IT'S CALLED THE STATE PROPERTY INVENTORY EITHER THERE IS A AN ANNUAL REPORTING PROCESS THAT APARTMENTS ARE OBLIGATED TO FOLLOW TO REPORT. ALL EXISTING PROPERTY TO D. G. SB CAN. BE COMPILED INTO INVENTORY THERE ARE SOME EXEMPTIONS IN STATUTE FOR REPORTERS IN ME UP DATA BURIED A LITTLE BIT AND ALSO REPORTED SO THERE'S YOU KNOW SOME GAPS. WHICH IS WHY WE ACTUALLY TO COUNTY ASSESSOR DATA AS OPPOSED TO RELYING TO IT BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THERE HAVE BEEN GAP HISTORICALLY WE EVEN LEAVE ANYTHING OUT. BUT AT THAT PROCESS DOES EXIST AND THAT'S WHERE DEPARTMENTS ARE OBLIGATED TO REPORT ACCESS TO US BUT AGAIN WE GET YOU KNOW ONE TWO YEAR TYPE OF THING. AND SO THIS EXECUTIVE ORDER REQUIRES TO GO OUT AND SAY INDEPENDENT ALL THAT REPORTING INDEPENDENT OF DEPARTMENT SELF SUPPORTING. LET'S ACTUALLY LOOK AT PROPERTY AND SEE WHAT'S OUT THERE AND WHAT APPEARS TO BE UNDER UTILIZED SO. THIS IS CREATED AN ACCESS LIST. THAT WE WOULD NEVER HAVE ARRIVED AT HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE EXECUTIVE ORDER. THE NAME ISSUE THAT THE CHAIR HAS JUST BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTION IS ALSO. OF MANIFEST IMPORTANCE AND IT GOES BACK MANY MANY YEARS. FOR EXAMPLE PEOPLE WANT TO MOVE OUT INTO THE MORE RURAL AREAS FOR THE AESTHETICS. THE BEAUTY OF IT. BUT THEN WHEN WE TRY TO SECURE FARM WORKER HOUSING. THEN HE'S COMING NO NO NO NO NOT HERE. ARE YOU WHAT WHAT ARE YOUR TECHNIQUES TO DEAL WITH THOSE KIND OF LOCAL. NIMBY IMPEDIMENTS THAT COME FORWARD HOW DO WE CONVINCE PEOPLE THAT HATE YOU KNOW. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE YOUR SHARE. BUT WE'VE HAD ISSUES OF THAT RELATED TO THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING MANDATE. COMMUNITIES TRYING TO WELL YOU KNOW NOT US NOW IT'S. THAT THAT'S THE THAT'S A HUGE PROBLEM AND IT'S GONNA HAVE TO BE WHEN YOU WRESTLE WITH DAILY I'M SURE. YEAH IT HONESTLY NOT TO START TO GO BACK TO A THEME BUT- WE MAY BLACKOUT NEVER SINGLE PARCELS IN A PLACE HER BODY WANTS TO DEVELOP WE MIGHT HAVE THE EXACT OPPOSITE THAT WE REALLY DON'T KNOW IN SOME CASES. BUT YEAH INSOFAR AS WE COME ACROSS THAT AND KIND OF BACK TO THE CHAIRS POINT IN IN MY ANSWER. WE DO HAVE. EXEMPTIONS BEING SOVEREIGN THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO GO QUITE THROUGH THE SAME A POOL PLANNING PROCESS. AGAIN WANT TO BE GOOD PARTNERS ONE OF LOCAL OUT REACH ALL THAT ABSOLUTELY BUT WE AREN'T SUBJECT TO. SOME OF THE- IN A PLANNING COMMISSION VOTES IN APPROVAL SET UP OR DOWN HOUSING IN THE PAST. YOU KNOW SEE COULD NOT WITHSTANDING WE DO HAVE YOU KNOW. STE SOVEREIGNTY OVER LOCAL PLANNING IN THOSE ISSUES SO. THOSE CAN BE LEVERAGED BUT AGAIN WE ARE LOOKING TO PRIORITIZE SITES WHERE. THAT THAT SYNERGY BETWEEN US AND LOCAL NEED AND WANT IS WELL ALIGNED. AND THEN WE CERTAINLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE WILL BE A GOOD BIT OF COMMUNITY OUT REACH THAN ANY OF THE SELECTED DEVELOPERS WOULD NEED TO ENGAGE AND SELL. OUT IMAGINE THAT THAT WILL BE PART OF WHAT WE'RE CONSIDERING. I'M THROUGH THE R. F. P. AND THEN REALLY LOOKING FOR THAT LOCAL PARTNERSHIP OR WAY FINDING SO THAT THAT LOCAL LIAISON. CAN REALLY HELP THE DEVELOPER NAVIGATE WHO ARE THE-FOLKS THAT NEED TO BE TALKED TO WHAT TYPE OF WHAT IS GOOD COMMUNITY OUTREACH LOOK LIKE IN THAT COMMUNITY. AND WHERE SOME OF THE STUMBLING BLOCKS. I'M SO THOSE ARE THINGS THAT WILL CERTAINLY BE FOCUSING. ON AND MAKING SURE THAT THE DEVELOPERS OF A PLAN TO DEAL WITH. THERE'S A NEW DYNAMIC IN THIS A LAST ALL SAY ON THIS FOR NOW BUT. THE DIFFICULTIES THAT WE'VE HAD WITH BUYERS WERE LITERALLY DEALING WITH THAT EVERY DAY. AND WE'VE HAD HOUSING PROBLEMS. SEVERELY EXACERBATED I WAS UP IN TO GO YESTERDAY AT MEETINGS ON THIS VERY ISSUE. AND WE ARE NOW HAVING HUGE HUGE ISSUES. NOT JUST PROVIDING NEW BUT REBUILDING. THAT'S GOING TO BE A HUGE DYNAMIC IN THE- AND WHAT WILL BE THEN OUR POLICIES RELATED TO MANAGING FORCING WHILE LANCE TO DIMINISH THE FIRE POTENTIAL. OUT THERE SO THAT ALSO FACTORS INTO IS IT NOT. IT DOES PART OF THE THAT THE STORE ABSOLUTELY IT DOES MEAN PART OF THE SCREENING PROCESS THAT WE'VE WE'VE GONE THROUGH IS TO LOOK AT WHERE THESE PROPERTY SAID IN RELATIONSHIP TO FIRE HAZARD AREAS DIFFERENT BILL THE AREAS. YOU KNOW THERE ARE SOME PROPERTIES AT APARTMENT MAYES SAID YES TO FALLS IN UP IN A RED ZONE AND SO KIND OF GOING BACK TO OUR OUR NUMBER OF YES PROPERTIES FLUCTUATING A LITTLE SORT OF THINGS THAT'LL MAKE SOMETHING FALL OFF OR OR AT THE BACK ON. AS TIME GOES ON SO YEAH THERE'S WE HAVE TAKE A LOOK AT THAT WE ALSO ARE COGNIZANT OF NOT. WANTING TO BUILD THE PLACE THAT IS. YOU KNOW MA'AM. CAN YOU SHOULD BE BRING DOWN LATER. OKAY I JUST WOULD CONCLUDE BY SAYING ASSUMING THAT THERE. MIGHT BE HAPPEN TO LOOK AT SOME STATUTORY CHANGES DOWN THE WAY TO FACILITATE YOUR GOALS. SIR HUESO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN ALAN THANK EVERYONE HERE FOR THIS AMAZING A PRESENTATION AND THIS IS JUST A TREMENDOUS UNDERTAKING I HAVE TO COMMEND ALL OF YOU ONE I GOT ELECTED TO CITY COUNCIL IN IN THE TWO THOUSAND SIX AND WE'RE GOING THROUGH A VERY SIMILAR HOUSING CRISIS BACK THEN WE HAD. ALSO SENSE OF URGENCY OF CREATING NEW STOCK AND- I DID SOMETHING SIMILAR WITH THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO OF IDENTIFYING UNUSED PARCELS AND FIND TRYING TO FIND WHICH ONES WERE HELPFUL AND WAS VERY INTERESTING. THAT THERE WAS A VERY LONG LIST O PROPERTY THAT CITY DID NOT EVEN HAVE AN INVENTORY. AND. THAT WAS A VERY TROUBLED DEPARTMENT RE REAL ESTATE ASSETS DEPARTMENT BECAUSE THEY HAD ALL THIS LAND THAT THEY DIDN'T EVEN KNOW. WHAT IT WAS AND WHERE IT WAS AND IT TOOK A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF TIME TO IDENTIFY WHAT THOSE PARCELS WARNER MAKES ME THINK. IN OF THAT'S THAT THE STATE HAS THAT IN THE COUNTIES HAVE THAT IN CITIES HOW MUCH LAND IS PUBLICLY ON. THERE'S BEEN FORGOTTEN. THAT SITTING OUT THERE NOT ACHIEVING OF BENEFIT TO THESE COMMUNITIES I CAN BE UTILIZED. I'M NOT I'M NOT A I'M NOT. AT IN ANY CASE THINK IN THAT YOU SHOULD GO AFTER THAT BECAUSE. BUT YOU KNOW KIND OF BEGS THE QUESTION OF THESE LATENT ASSETS THEY'RE NOT PAYING A PROPERTY TAX WHAT'S THE VALUE TO OUR STATE. OF PUTTING THESE ASSETS BACK TO WORK EVEN IF WE WERE TO SELL THEM IF THEY'RE NOT. ARE THERE SOME VALUE IN AN AND LOOKING IN THAT BECAUSE THAT COULD VERY MUCH PAY. FOR THIS DEVELOPMENT. AND ALSO BRING ADDITIONAL REVENUE TO THE STATE FOR FUTURE YEARS A SOMETHING I THINK WE SHOULD LOOK AT THAT FOURTY FOUR THOUSAND PARCELS THAT'S- THAT'S A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF LAND YOU KNOW EVEN IF I UNDERSTAND SOME OF THESE ARE REMNANTS OF OTHER PARCELS THAT WERE USED FOR ON RAMPS FOR FREE WAY. OR OR FOR YOU KNOW THIS THIRD THERE'S GOTTA BE A WAY TO IDENTIFY THE ONES ARE USABLE IT. AND IF THEY'RE NOT NESTLE USABLE FOR HOUSING THAT COULD BE USED FOR AGRICULTURE OR SOMETHING ELSE OR TO HELP. FINALIZE A PARTIAL THAT WOULD BE USED TO BRING REVENUE TO THE STATE TO ALSO HELP WITH PAYING THE COSTS OF SUPPORTING THIS HOUSING SO THAT MAY BE KIND OF THE NEXT STEP IN THIS PROCESS OF. IF WE WANT TO DO THAT BUT- GENERALLY. I RECOMMEND THAT AS WE GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS THAT WE ESTABLISH SOME KIND OF. AS A RESOLUTION OR AN ACTUAL BILL A LAW KIND OF ESTABLISHING THE URGENCY AT A CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA SOMETHING THAT ACCOMPANIES THIS ACTION TO TRUMP ALL OTHER. LAWS IN TERMS OF THE NECESSITY AND THE URGENCY TO ADD TO THE HOUSING STOCK. IF WE DID THAT IN IN IN CONJUNCTION WITH THIS WHO WOULD HELP TO STREAMLINE THE PROCESS OF GETTING THESE PROJECTS APPROVED. I DO RECOMMEND WORKING LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO MINIMIZE THE CONFLICT AND ENSURE THAT WERE WEST WE BUILD HOUSING THERE THEY'RE WORKING IN TWO. THE EXISTING. OUR COMMUNITY PLANS THAT THEY'RE CONSISTENT WITH THE ZONING IN THE AREA THAT THE DESIGN IS CONSISTENT WITH WOULD LOCAL. CODES I THINK THAT CAN BE DONE IT IN A WAY THAT WOULD HELP MAKE THESE. PROJECTS UP QUICKLY BUILDABLE BUT ALSO SUSTAINABLE OVER SEVERAL YEARS IT'S IS VERY IMPORTANT TO DO THAT TO MAKE SURE WE SUPPORT OUR COMMUNITIES AS WE BUILD THIS NEST NECESSARY HOUSING. AND THE NEXT THING AS YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT. MAKING SURE THAT WE GIVE THE DEVELOPERS THE DISCRETION TO COME UP WITH A BUSINESS PLAN THAT FITS. YOU KNOW THE PARTS ON THE LOCATION I THINK THAT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT. BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE BUILDING A WORKFORCE HOUSE IN THAT WERE BUILDING HOUSING FOR THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA THAT THIS HOUSE IT'S NOT GOING TO BE USED. AS A VACATION HOME MORE AIRBNB. WE GOT TO FIND A WAY TO ENSURE THAT ONE THIS HOUSING IT'S BILL'S GOING TO BE BUILT FOR CALIFORNIANS. IT'S GOING TO BE BUILT TO ALLEVIATE THE HOUSING CRISIS. AND NOT FOR ANYTHING OTHER THAN THAT AND THAT I THINK HAS TO BE CLEAR IN THIS PROCESS TO WHOEVER. INTENDS TO DEVELOP. PROVIDING THE SUPPLY IS CRITICAL. AND IT BUT IT'S GOTTA BE SUPPLY FOR ACTUAL HOUSING FOR PEOPLE LIVE IT AND THAT'S AND THAT'S WHAT I THINK WE HAVE TO. ENSURE THAT WE DO. OTHER THAN THAT I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING YOU SAID THOSE WITH THESE ARE JUST MY RECOMMENDATIONS BECAUSE. YOU KNOW I WAS INVOLVED IN INTRODUCING A YOU KNOW THOUSANDS OF UNITS INTO SAN DIEGO WE TO A COMBINATION OF CONDO CONVERSIONS WE DID. NEW HOUSE IN WE DID MARKET RATE I THINK THROUGH THIS PROCESS. WE'VE WE'VE GOT OF. THERE'S GOTTA THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME DISCRETION GIVEN TO YOU TO ALLOW TO WORK WITH THE DEVELOPMENT SEEMS TO COME UP WITH A MIX. A HEALTHY MIX OF HOUSING AGAIN. IF YOU CREATE SUPPLY I WILL CRITICIZE BUT IF THERE'S SOME WAY TO. GUIDE THIS PROCESS TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE CREATING AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THERE REALLY ARE WITH THAT WE ARE CREATING A COMBINATION OF MAYBE. APARTMENTS WITH MAYBE SOME FOR OWNERSHIP. AND BRING IN MORE OWNERSHIP IN THE COMMUNITY IF THERE'S A WAY TO DO THAT I THINK THAT WOULD BE IDEAL AND I THINK WITH THAT WOULD. CREATE MORE BY AN- FROM FROM THE PEOPLE OF OUR COMMUNITY AND. THE LAST THING I WANT TO SAY IS SAN DIEGO WE'RE TRYING TO REBUILD OUR OUR CITY HALLAND IN SOME CASES THERE'S NO LAND IN SOME CASES VERY. EXPENSIVE. AND IF THERE'S WAYS TO PARTNER WITH LOCAL SINCE SOME OF THESE PROJECTS IN IN AREAS WHERE WE HAVE A STATE BUILDING THAT IS UNDER UTILIZED. HAVE WE LOOKED AT EXISTING FACILITIES ARE UNDER UTILIZED FOR MAYBE A POTENTIAL REDUCE MAYBE THAT IS THE SECOND PHASE. GOING INTO NEXT YEAR AS YOU GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS BUT THERE'S VALUE IN THAT BECAUSE. IN MY COMMUNITY THERE ARE SOME STATE BUILDINGS ARE BEING UTILIZED THEY DO HAVE STAFF TO DO PER THEY ARE PROVIDING. A BENEFIT TO THE COMMUNITY BUT THEY'RE UNDER UTILIZED AND THEY COULD BE ADDED TO AND THEY COULD BE COMBINED WITH OTHER LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND OTHER INITIATIVES SO. IT AS THAT ARISES I HOPE YOU YOU'RE YOU'RE OPEN TO THAT AND I HOPE YOU. LOOK AT THE VARIOUS POSSIBILITIES THAT CAN BE EMPLOYED. COMPLETELY OUT SO YOU HAVE OF ME JUST TO TWO QUICK POINTS I CAN ONE WE WERE DELIBERATELY LIBERAL AS I SAID EARLIER IN TERMS OF TRYING TO. PULLING HIS MANY PROPERTY AND SO THAT WE COULD BE TOLD NO AS OPPOSED TO SELL SCREEN THINGS OUT WE'VE ALSO PRETTY TRANSPARENT WITH ANYONE WHO'S ASKED WE ARE HAPPY TO BE SECOND GUESSED IF WE LIMIT SOMETHING UNDULY. I'D RATHER YOU KNOW HAVE SOMEONE TO TAKE THEIR FINGER IN TAKING A BRING THAT BACK IN A LITTLE BIT WITH AN APARTMENT AND X. HAVE SOMETHING EXCLUDED SO THAT'S WHY WERE WERE YOU KNOW BACK CAUTIOUSLY LOOKING FORWARD TO THE VOLUME. OF RESPONSES WERE GONNA GET ONCE THE MAP IS OUT BECAUSE I THINK THAT'LL HELP YOU KNOW KEEP US ACCOUNTABLE IN TERMS OF PROPERTIES THAT YOU KNOW MAYBE SHOULD HAVE BEEN A LIST THAT WEREN'T HOPEFULLY THERE'S VERY VERY FEW OF THOSE BUT WE WANT TO SORT OF THAT SECOND CHECK. AND YOU KNOW THINGS LIKE YOU KNOW THERE'S A STATE OFFICE BUILDING IN SAN DIEGO THAT WE CONTROL THAT YOU KNOW IT'S IT HAS BEEN DECLARED ACCESS. ALREADY AT THIS POINT IN THE LAST YEAR. THE PAR SPRINT ON BUYING BUT EXECUTIVE ORDERS I THINK. YEAH WE ARE WE ARE LOOKING AT THINGS PRETTY BROADLY AND HOPEFULLY EVERYBODY WILL BE PLEASANTLY SURPRISED AT WHAT'S AS WHAT'S ON THE LIST. AND IS THIS BEING THIS IS PROCESS BEING ADVERTISED THROUGH YOUR WEB PAGE IS THERE A DITCH A DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCESS THE FOLLOWING AND- A WHAT POINT YOU REACH MILESTONES AND YEAH THERE'S A FIGHT BIDS UNDIGESTED WEBSITE UNDER MY DIVISION THERE IS AN EXECUTIVE ORDER PAGE IT OUTLINES BECAUSE THE WORK WE'VE DONE WHAT THAT MEANS WHAT THE NEXT STEPS ARE. THAT'S WHERE THE HEATING APPLE TO GET POSTED SO IT'LL BE SORT OF THE CENTRAL HUB FOR COMMUNICATIONS FOR THE EFFORT. OKAY THANK YOU CENTER THERE IS A. OUT OF THAT OKAY PAGE RIGHT HERE IN YOUR IN YOUR- FOLDER AS WELL CENTER BRADFORD. THANK YOU I JUST WANT TO FALL BACK UP ON THE HOMELESS ISSUE AND MOST HOUSING THAT CENTERED AROUND HOMELESS IS TEMPORARY. AND SO WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THIS HOUSING THAT IS TARGETED FOR HOMELESSNESS WILL BE PERMANENT HOUSING BECAUSE THE GOVERNOR SENT A LETTER GOVERNOR BROWN SIMILAR TO THE SENATE. STATING PROPERTIES THAT WERE NEVER MEANT TO BE PLACES FOR PEOPLE TO LIVE CAN ONLY BE USED AS TEMPORARY HOUSING IS THAT THE FORMER YOU GUYS ARE STILL IT HEARING TO. WE'RE NOT APPROACHING THIS FROM A TEMPORARY HOUSING WE'RE LOOKING AT PERMANENT HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES AND RENTAL HOUSING BEING THE MAIN DRIVER OF WHAT WE'RE EXAMINING RIGHT NOW OF PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING FITS WITHIN ADVANCE. AND SO WE HAVE PROGRAMS THAT EACH CD THAT SERVICE THAT THERE'S A FUNDING RIGHT NOW AVAILABLE FOR PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AS WELL TO SUPPORT THAT SO EVEN ON THOSE SITES THAT WERE DEEMED NOT IDEAL. FOR HOUSING YOU WILL BE PLACING IF YOU'VE FIND A PARCEL AND YOU WOULD FOR. SORRY I MISSPOKE NO FOR THINGS THAT ARE DETERMINED NOT TO BE FEASIBLE FOR HOUSING WE'RE NOT LOOKING TO DEVELOP THEIR AS PART OF THIS SO THAT COULD BE. ADJACENT SEES IT COULD BE SITE CONTAMINATION COULD BE THINGS THAT WE JUST CAN'T THE ABSENT OUT BUT I MEAN BUT SOME THINGS MIGHT JUST BE YOUR CLOSE PROXIMITY TO A FREEWAY OR SOMETHING AND HE SAID. I MIGHT NOT DEVELOP BUT IT IT'S AVAILABLE LAND OWNED BY THE STATE OR THE COUNTY YEAH I THINK THIS IS WHERE WE'RE GOING TO BE EXPLORING YOU KNOW AND SO IN THE WORLD OF HOW WE'VE BEEN PRIORITIZING WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOME OF THE SPECIFIC FACTORS THAT WE OUTLINED TO SEE WHERE THERE'S- NATURALLY GOOD FITS. I'M BY YES THERE ARE CERTAINLY PROPERTIES WITHIN THE INVENTORY THAT OUR HIGHWAY ADJACENT OR MAYBE A LITTLE BIT MORE REMOTE WILL CONTINUE TO EXPLORE THOSE NOT SAYING THAT IT'S A NO NEVER. I AM BUT JUST THE QUESTION OF WHEN WILL CERTAINLY COME UP. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. YOU BEING HERE THIS MORNING THANK YOU. HE OUR NEXT PANEL. TITLED THE ROLE OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AFFORDABLE HOUSING ORGANIZATIONS WILL HAVE JOHN DUNBAR MAYOR TOWN OF YACHT BILL. AND IT SAYS SECOND VICE PRESIDENT LEE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES I JUST WANT TO MAKE IT KNOWN HE IS GOING TO BE OR IS THE FIRST VICE PRESIDENT. SO THAT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE DAVID SISTER ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF HOUSING CALIFORNIA. YOU HEAR. IN PEDRO GO GOV A SENIOR POLICY MANAGER WITH THE NONPROFIT HOUSING ASSOCIATION OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WELCOME ALL OF YOU THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND MISTER DUNBAR MAYOR DUNBAR WILL START WITH YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD MORNING TERRY DODD AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. AS THE CHURCH'S STATED I'M JOHN DUNBAR MAYOR OF THE TOWN OF YON PHIL AND THE CURRENT. TRANSITIONING SECOND VICE PRESIDENT OF THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES IN BOTH MY CAPACITIES I WANT TO EXPRESS. MY AND OUR SUPPORT OF GOVERNOR NEWSOME'S EXECUTIVE ORDER I COMMEND THE GOVERNOR'S LEADERSHIP TO INSPIRE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT IS ALL INCOME LEVELS. I APPLAUD HIS COMMITMENT TO SUPPORT LOCAL GOVERNMENT WAS SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN THE BUDGET. AS WELL AS OTHER TOOLS THAT CAN PROVIDE SOLUTIONS FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS WHO STRUGGLE TO BUY OR RENT HOUSING. I TESTIFIED BEFORE THE ASSEMBLY LOCAL GOVERNMENT COMMITTEE LAST MONTH IN SUPPORT OF SB FIVE IS ONE OF THOSE TOOLS. THAT WOULD CREATE AN ONGOING FUNDING PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE STATE I CALIFORNIA CITIES IT WOULD JUMP START THE PRODUCTION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS. SB FIVE WOULD PROVIDE CITIES AND COUNTIES THE RESOURCES TO SUBSIDIZE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. INVEST IN RELATED INFRASTRUCTURE AND ADDRESS OTHER CRITICAL STATE PRIORITIES LIKE CLIMATE CHANGE AND FIRE WISE BUILDING. LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS ARE PREPARED TO USE THESE TOOLS TO SUPPORT THE CONSTRUCTION OF BELOW MARKET RATE UNITS. FOR FAMILIES STRUGGLING TO AFFORD HOUSING NEAR THEIR JOBS DEVELOP TRANSIT ORIENTED HOUSING THAT WILL REDUCE TRAFFIC CONGESTION ENCOURAGE URBAN INFILL DEVELOPMENT BY REHABILITATING AND IMPROVING INFRASTRUCTURE. AND PROTECT COMMUNITIES ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY SEA LEVEL RISE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. QUICKEN SURE SCENARIO WHERE THIS EFFORT IS UNDER WAY AND MY COMMUNITY. THE BILL IS A SMALL TOWN OF FEWER THAN THREE THOUSAND RESIDENTS IN THE HEART OF THE NAPA VALLEY. IN NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT NAPA COUNTY ADOPTED THE NATION'S FIRST AGRICULTURAL PRESERVE. IN ORDER TO ORDER TO PROTECT AGRICULTURAL LAND AND OUR REGIONAL ECONOMY. DESPITE LOCAL EFFORTS INCLUDING THE PASSAGE LAST YEAR OF A COUNTY WIDE 1% INCREASE IN THE HOTEL TAX THAT IS DEDICATED TO WORKFORCE HOUSING PROJECTS. WE ARE FACED WITH HIGH HOME PRICES AND LOW INVENTORY THAT KEEP HOUSING OUT OF REACH FOR MANY OF OUR WORKING FAMILIES. THE LARGEST EMPLOYER IN OUR COMMUNITIES THE CALIFORNIA VETERANS HOME. WITH CLOSE TO ONE THOUSAND MILITARY VETERAN RESIDENTS AND NEARLY NINE HUNDRED EMPLOYEES. UP TO ONE HUNDRED CARE GIVER JOBS REMAIN UNFILLED AT THE VETERANS HOME MAINLY BECAUSE THE COST OF LIVING DOES NOT ALIGN WITH HOUSEHOLD INCOMES. OUR NAPA VALLEY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT CONTINUES TO EXPERIENCE DECLINING ENROLLMENT IN LARGE PART ALSO BECAUSE FAMILIES CANNOT AFFORD TO LIVE IN THE AREA. THE RELATED DROP IN STATE FUNDING HAS RESULTED IN MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN BUDGET CUTS AND IMMINENT CLOSURE OF SEVERAL HIGH PERFORMING BUT SMALL PUBLIC SCHOOLS INCLUDING YOUR AWFUL ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WHICH DATES BACK TO THE EIGHTEEN EIGHTIES. FOR MORE THAN THREE YEARS I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH LEADERSHIP IN THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS GENERAL SERVICES HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE TO BRING HOUSING TO PONDER UTILIZE SECTIONS. OF THE SIX HUNDRED PLUS ACRE VETERANS ON CAMPUS. WE HAVE IDENTIFIED LOCATIONS ON THE PROPERTY SUITABLE FOR HOUSING AND THE TOWN OF YALTA HAS COMMITTED ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR A FEASIBILITY STUDY TO CREATE HOUSING THAT COULD SERVE EMPLOYEES. ALMOST VETERANS AMONG OTHERS. GOVERNOR NEWSOME'S EXECUTIVE ORDER HAS GENERATED SIGNIFICANT MOMENTUM AT ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT TO SUPPORT OUR EFFORTS AND YOU DON'T FEEL AS WELL AS WITH OTHER HOUSING PROJECTS IN CITIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. WE AWAIT THE RELEASE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES LIST AS DISCUSSED EARLIER. IDENTIFYING PROPERTY SUITABLE FOR HOUSING CITIES ARE PREPARED RIGHT NOW TO PARTNER WITH THE STATE AND THE DEVELOPMENT INDUSTRY TO MOVE THE NEEDLE ON HOUSING AFFORDABILITY AND AVAILABILITY. AS PART OF THE PARTNERSHIPS I REFERENCED A MOMENT AGO WITH KEY STATE AGENCIES THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES HAS OFFERED TO HELP IDENTIFY MEMBERS CITIES. JUST UNDER FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY MEMBERS. READY TO INCORPORATE AVAILABLE ACCESS STATE PROPERTY INTO THEIR HOUSING PLANS TO HELP SPUR AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. THIS EXECUTIVE ORDER PRESENTS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO WORK IN COLLABORATION TO HELP DETERMINE THE VIABILITY OF BUILDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS ON AXIS STATE PROPERTY. IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO LEARN MORE FROM THE G. S. AND H. E. D. ON THE SET OF CRITERIA THEY HAVE ESTABLISHED AND AGAIN DISCUSSED EARLIER. AND HOW WE'RE GOING TO PRINT PRIORITIZE. SUITABLE SITES. WE ALL WE THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES ALSO HAVE OFFERED TO HOST A WEBINAR TO EDUCATE OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT COLLEAGUES ABOUT THE EXECUTIVE ORDER AND THE SUBSTANTIAL LEGISLATIVE DOLLARS AVAILABLE TO PLAN DESIGN ENGAGE THE DEVELOPMENT INDUSTRY TO BUILD HOUSING. THE EXECUTIVE ORDER STATES THAT QUOTE FOSTERING HOUSING INNOVATION WILL CATALYZE NEW CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRIES AND SPUR JOB GROWTH IN THE STATE A QUOTE. AND CITIES WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTNER. THE ORDER ALSO IDENTIFIES THE FINANCIAL INCENTIVE THAT WILL RESULT FROM PRIORITIZING ACCESS STATE OWNED PROPERTIES FOR HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. BY REMOVING WHAT IS TYPICALLY THE MOST EXPENSIVE ELEMENT OF HOUSING DEVELOPMENT LAND COST THE STATE ACKNOWLEDGES IT CAN FACILITATE IMMEDIATE AND SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS THAT WILL RESORT THE RESORT AND MORE HOUSING UNITS ACTUALLY BEING BUILT. I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT MY STORY AND THE LEAGUE SUPPORT OF THIS EFFORT. THANK YOU AND I WELCOME ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU MAYOR MISTER SISTER. AND WHAT WILL ENTER HAVE QUESTIONS AFTER BUT THE OLD BATTLES DONE THANK YOU. THANK YOU DOCTOR DIED IN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME I'M DAVE IS A CERTAIN AND THE ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF HOUSING-CALIFORNIA. HELLO HOUSING CALIFORNIA IS THE VOICE IN THE STATE CAPITAL FOR CHILDREN SENIORS FAMILIES PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND EVERYONE WHO NEEDS A SAFE HOME. OUR MEMBERS INCLUDE THE MOST SOPHISTICATED NONPROFIT AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY IN THE NATION. AS WELL AS LOCAL AND REGIONAL ORGANIZATIONS IMPLEMENTING CUTTING EDGE APPROACHES TO ENDING HOMELESSNESS. AND RESIDENTS OF NON PROFIT ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING COMMUNITIES. WE ENVISION A CALIFORNIA WHERE NO ONE IS HOMELESS AND EVERYONE CAN AFFORD A SAFE STABLE PLACE TO CALL HOME IN A HEALTHY VIBRANT AND PROSPEROUS COMMUNITY. YET ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING PARTNERSHIP AND I HAVE COPIES OF THE REPORT IF YOU'D LIKE. CALIFORNIA HAS A SHORTAGE OF ONE POINT FOUR MILLION HOMES AVAILABLE AND AFFORDABLE TO THE LOWEST INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. STRUGGLING THE MOST. MORE THAN THREE QUARTERS OF HOUSEHOLDS AT THE LOWEST INCOME ARE PAYING MORE THAN 50% OF THEIR INCOME. TOWARDS RENT. MAKING THEM SEVERELY RENDON BURDENED AND FORCING MANY FAMILIES TO CHOOSE BETWEEN PAYING FOR HEALTH CARE GROCERIES. AND OTHER NECESSITIES AND LEAVING ON ONE PAGE WAY CALLING ON HOMELESSNESS. MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND PEOPLE EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS ON ANY GIVEN NIGHT IN CALIFORNIA AND THE NUMBERS RIGHT IS RISING. THAT'S ENOUGH TO FILL THE ENTIRE CITY OF PASADENA FOR EXAMPLE. SACRAMENTO WE HAVE THE THIRD FASTEST RISING RENTS OUT OF THE FIFTY LARGEST METRO AREAS IN THE NATION. AND MORE THAN FIFTY FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS ON A GIVEN NIGHT MARKING A 19% INCREASE COUNTY WIDE. THE LACK OF HOMES AFFORDABLE TO LOWER INCOME CALIFORNIANS AFFECTS CALIFORNIANS OF ALL STRIPES BUT PEOPLE OF COLOR ARE IMPACTED THE MOST. MAKING THIS AN ECONOMIC AND RACIAL JUSTICE ISSUE AS WELL. TO SOLVE PROBLEMS OF THIS MAGNITUDE WE NEED BIG BALD OUT OF THE BOX SOLUTIONS TO GET AT THE HEART OF THIS ISSUE. WE NEED TO PEOPLE LIVING ON MODEST BUDGETS AND FOR THOSE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. GOVERNOR NEWSOME'S EXECUTIVE ORDER MAKING ACCESS STATE OWNED PROPERTY AVAILABLE FOR SUCH DEVELOPMENT. IS AN EXAMPLE OF AN OUT OF THE BOX APPROACH THAT WE WILL NEED ESPECIALLY IF IT'S FOCUSED ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. FOR THOSE STRUGGLING THE MOST. EXPERTS NOW THIS APPROACH WORKS THIS APPROACH WORKS IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN ENTERPRISE COMMUNITY PARTNERS RELEASED A REPORT CALLED. PUBLIC BENEFIT FROM PUBLICLY ON PARCELS EFFECTIVE PRACTICES AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. ACCORDING TO THAT REPORT QUOTE USING PUBLICLY OWNED PARCELS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING CAN INCREASE LOW AND MIDDLE INCOME HOUSEHOLDS ACCESS TO HIGH OPPORTUNITY NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE PROPERTY VALUES ZONING AND SIDE OF L. AVAILABILITY CAN MAKE HOUSING SERVING THESE POPULATION SCARCE. IT CAN ALSO INCREASE THOSE HOUSEHOLDS ACCESS TO EMPLOYMENT TRANSIT COMMUNITY CENTERS HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND SCHOOLS AND QUOTE. THIS POLICY PROVIDES SEVERAL OPPORTUNITIES SIMULTANEOUSLY ADVANCING BOTH LAND USE AND FINANCE STRATEGIES FIRST IT FACILITATES INCLUSION BY MAKING LAND AVAILABLE IN PLACES THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE EXCLUDE LOW WAGE WORKERS OF COLOR. SECOND IT REDUCES THE COST OF LAND WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR AROUND 10% BUT CAN ACCOUNT FOR AS MUCH AS THIRD IT MAKES MORE LAND AVAILABLE FOR MULTI FAMILY DEVELOPMENT WHICH IS CRITICAL GIVEN THAT MORE THAN THREE QUARTERS OF RESIDENTIAL LAND IN CALIFORNIA IS ON FOR SINGLE FAMILY HOMES. HOUSING CALIFORNIA PLOTS GOVERNOR NEWSOME'S INITIATIVE TO STATE LAND TO FACILITATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR CAL FOR CALIFORNIANS LEFT BEHIND IN THE ECONOMY. IT ADDS A CRITICAL TOOL TO THE TOOL BOX MOREOVER THE STATE'S LEADERSHIP AND PRIORITIZING PUBLIC LAND FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING SUCH A STRONG EXAMPLE FOR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO FOLLOW. IT HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED FOR STRONG ENFORCEMENT OF LOCAL JURISDICTIONS CURRENT OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE SURPLUS LAND ACT WHEN LOCAL AGENCIES SELL OR LEASE THEIR LAND UNDER THAT ACT THEY MUST FIRST MAKE OUT THE LAND AVAILABLE TO NONPROFIT AFFORDABLE OUSING DEVELOPERS. AND IT DEMONSTRATES THE IMPORTANCE OF PASSING ASSEMBLY MEMBER TANGS AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY SIX WHICH IS CO AUTHORED BY SENATOR WINNER. AND WOOD STRENGTHENING CLARIFY THE SURPLUS LAND ACT. THIS EXECUTIVE ORDER IS NOT A CURE ALL WHEEL STEER STONE AND MUCH MORE ON GOING STATE FUNDING TO HELP HARD WORKING CALIFORNIANS. AFFORD A DECENT PLACE TO LIVE THROUGH CURRENCY CURRENT LEGISLATION LIKE A. B. TOWN AND SB FIVE AS MENTIONED. WILL NEED MORE LAND USE CHANGES TO MAKE AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT EASIER THROUGH BILLS LIKE AB SEVENTEEN SIXTY THREE. AND WE NEED MORE PROTECTION FOR TENANTS AND MORE MEASURES TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM FALLING INTO HOMELESSNESS IN THE FIRST PLACE LIKE SB THREE TWENTY NINE AND AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO. BUT THIS ORDER MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE PRACTICALLY AND FINANCIALLY. AND COMBINED WITH THE INVESTMENTS IN THE BUDGET. AS WLL AS BILLS CURRENTLY MOVING THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE. THIS ORDER SENDS A STRONG MESSAGE THAT OUR GOVERNMENT IS SERIOUS ABOUT SOLVING THE HOUSING AFFORDABILITY CRISIS. HOUSING CALIFORNIA AND OUR MEMBERS LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO WORK OUT THE DETAILS OF IMPLEMENTATION. TO ENSURE THAT THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER IS AS EFFECTIVE AS POSSIBLE A CRITIC MORE AFFORDABLE HOMES AND PERMANENT SUPPORT OF HOMES FOR CALIFORNIANS STRUGGLING THE MOST. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MYSTERY AVAIL. GOOD MORNING CHAIR DODD MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME MY NAME IS PEDRO GOLF ALL AND I'M THE SENIOR POLICY MANAGER WITH THE NONPROFIT HOUSING ASSOCIATION NORTHERN CALIFORNIA THOUGHT PROFIT HOUSING ASSOCIATION OF THE CALIFORNIA IS A LONG STANDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION CELEBRATING OUR FORTIETH ANNIVERSARY THIS YEAR WE REPRESENT THOSE WHO BUILD AND PRESERVE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND OUR MISSION IS TO SEE A BAY AREA WHERE EVERYONE HAS AN AFFORDABLE PLACE TO CALL. HOME AND SO WE ARE HERE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER ON SURPLUS LAND. BECAUSE PRIORITIZING SURPLUS LAND FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS A CRITICAL PART OF THE SOLUTION TOWARDS BUILDING A FUTURE WHERE EVERYONE IN CALIFORNIA CAN HAVE AN AFFORDABLE PLACE TO CALL HOME. AS MY COLLEAGUE DAVID MENTIONED CALIFORNIA IS EXPERIENCING A HISTORICAL AFFORDABLE HOUSING WELL HISTORICAL HOUSING CRISIS. AND WITH SIX OF THE NATION'S TEN MOST EXPENSIVE. AND SO WHEN WE LOOK AT SOLUTIONS THAT CAN TURN UNUSED AND UNDER UTILIZED PUBLIC LANDS INTO PUBLIC CARD MY PRIORITIZING THAT PLANNED FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE TEND TO BE VERY SUPPORTIVE. GENERALLY THE PROBLEM IS THAT WE DON'T KNOW AND UP UNTIL THE SIX SECOND OF ORDER WE DIDN'T KNOW WHERE THAT LAND WISE. AND EVEN IF THE SITES WERE KNOWN IT WAS DIFFICULT AND IT IS DIFFICULT AND GENERAL TO DETERMINE WHETHER THOSE SITES ARE VIABLE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. AND WITHOUT CLEAR PRIORITY FROM THE STATE AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS ARE TYPICALLY NOT COMPETITIVE FOR ACQUIRING THOSE SITES AND DEVELOPING THEM TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IN THE BAY AREA A STUDY CONDUCTED BY THE METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION IDENTIFIED OVER SEVEN HUNDRED ACRES OF PUBLICLY OWNED LAND WITHIN HALF A MILE OF HIGH QUALITY TRANSIT. THAT OUR CUP ALSO COMPETITIVE FOR STATE AFFORDABLE HOUSING FUNDING. JUSTICE CREAM OF THE CROP SITES CAN ACCOMMODATE BETWEEN TWENTY ONE THOUSAND TO THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND NEW AFFORDABLE HOMES AND PRIME LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT THE REGION. IF YOU WERE TO EXPAND THIS UNIVERSE OF PUBLICLY OWNED PARCELS PARCELS BEYOND JUST THOSE THAT ARE WALKABLE. IN PRIME TRANSIT ORIENTED LOCATIONS THAT NUMBER WILL LIKELY EXPAND TO A FEW THOUSAND ACRES IN THE BAY AREA ALONE. AND IT DOESN'T TAKE MUCH IMAGINATION TO EXTRAPOLATE THAT IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE ISSUE STATE WIDE. THIS WOULD CORRESPOND TO LIKELY TENS OF THOUSANDS OF ACRES AVAILABLE THAT COULD BE MADE AVAILABLE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING TO HOUSE ALL CALIFORNIANS. THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING PARTNERSHIP CORP A CORPORATION ESTIMATES THAT THE STATE TO A SHORT ONE POINT FOUR MILLION AFFORDABLE HOMES. TO FULLY HOUSE CALIFORNIANS OF ALL INCOME LEVELS. WE ALREADY HAVE THE LAND NOW THAT COULD BE USED TO HOUSE THESE CALIFORNIANS. AND SO. WHAT MAKES IS REALLY SUPPORTIVE OF THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER IS THAT IT HELPS ADDRESS EACH OF THE ISSUES THAT IDENTIFIED EARLIER FIRST THE EXECUTIVE ORDER CREATES A STATEWIDE DATABASE OF SURPLUS SURPLUS STATE OWNED LAND THAT COULD BE USED FOR DOUBLE HOUSING. PROVIDING THE TOOLS TOWARD DEVELOPERS TO QUICKLY IDENTIFY OPPORTUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT COULD BE USED TO BUILD MORE AFFORDABLE HOMES SECOND THE EXECUTIVE ORDER WINDOWS DOWN THE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF SURPLUS STATE SITES TO JUST THOSE THAT COULD BE MADE MOST QUICKLY AVAILABLE TO ACCOMMODATE AFFORDABLE HOUSING EXPEDITING THE PROCESS THAT THE BALLOT BRISCOE THROUGH. AND THIRTY EXECUTIVE ORDER PROVIDES CLEAR DIRECTION TO ISSUE A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT ON THOSE SITES BECAUSE WITHOUT CLEAR DIRECTION FROM THE STATE pEVEN IF THE SITES ARE BOTH KNOWN AND VIABLE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT THEY CAN SIT VACANT FOR A LONG TIME OR THEY CAN BE USED FOR OTHER PRIORITIES BECAUSE THERE'S ALWAYS OTHER PRIORITIES EVEN WITH AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS. AND SO NPH SO SUPPORTIVE OF THE CHANGES THAT WE ARE CO SPONSORING LEGISLATION THAT WILL DO MUCH OF THE SAME AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. WHICH IS AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY SIX BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHANGE. WHAT THAT BILL WILL DO IS IT WILL. ALSO HELP IDENTIFY SITES THAT ARE OWNED BY LOCAL AGENCIES CLARIFY THE PROCESS THAT LOCAL AGENCIES CAN TAKE TO PRIORITIZE STILL SITES FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND CREATES MUCH NEEDED ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS. AND SO WHILE PUBLIC LAND IS NOT THE COMPLETE SOLUTION TO OUR STATE'S HOUSING CRISIS WHEN COUPLED OF OTHER CHANGES THAT WE HAVE SEEN IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. HE CAN HAVE A TREMENDOUS IMPACT TO MAKE A SIGNIFICANT DENT IN OUR FOR DOUBLE HOUSING NEED. AND SO ENCLOSING MY TESTIMONY I WOULD LIKE TO LEAVE YOU WITH AN EXAMPLE OF EXACTLY HOW A LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAS PARTNERED WITH AN AFFORDABLE DEVELOPER. TO MAKES STATE SURPLUS LAND AVAILABLE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING SO EVEN HOUSING LOCATED IN HAYWARD CALIFORNIA. WORKED WITH OF THE CITIES OF HAYWARD AND CASTRO VALLEY TO ACQUIRE A PARCEL THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY OWNED BY CALTRANS ALONG HIGHWAY TWO THIRTY STATE HIGHWAY TWO THIRTY FOUR. AND IS NOW IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING THAT SITE TWO SEVENTY TWO NEW OF INTER SEVENTY TWO NEW FFORDABLE HOMES THAT WILL BE AFFORDABLE TO FAMILIES MAKING BETWEEN WHICH TRANSLATES TO. ROUGHLY BETWEEN TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR TWO SEVENTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR FOR A FAMILY OF FOUR. THAT IS SO DESPERATELY NEEDED IN ALAMEDA COUNTY AND WE EXPECT THAT TO BE COMING OUT SHORTLY. AND SO WE THINK AND ASSERT THAT A FOR THAT SIR SLAM'S HAS A TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL TO ADDRESS OUR STATE TO FOR A HOUSING CRISIS. AND WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR THIS EXECUTIVE ORDER SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON THIS MATTER. AND WE'RE HAPPY THE NONPROFIT HOUSING ASSOCIATION NORTHERN CALIFORNIA IS HAPPY TO BE A RESOURCE TO YOU AND THE ADMINISTRATION AS YOU CONTINUE TO BOTH IMPLEMENT THIS ORDER AND ON MATTERS PERTAINING TO THE USE OF SURPLUS LAND FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH FOR YOUR A. CUSTOMER TODAY ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FROM. SEC MEMBERS THE SENATE COMMITTEE. SEE THE SCENE CENTER NIELSEN PLEASE. BUT I ASK ANY OF YOU JUST TO MAKE AN OBSERVATION IF YOU WOULD AS YOU ARE. ARE LOOKING FROM YOUR OWN PERSPECTIVES ABOUT THE PRESERVATION OF AGRICULTURAL LANDS. IS THAT A CONCERN. OR DO YOU. LOOK AT THAT AS OPPORTUNITY FOR SUCH HOUSING. CORD IF I MAY. YES IT'S A CONCERN I AS I REFERENCED IN MY STATEMENT WE HAVE AN AGRICULTURAL PRESERVE IN NAPA COUNTY HI WHICH IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF OUR ENTIRE REGION. ONE OF THE REASONS THAT I HAVE WORKED SO DILIGENTLY WITH THE STATE AGENCIES RELATED TO THE VETERANS HOME IT IS LITERALLY THE ONLY LARGE PARCEL THAT IS VIABLE. IT DOES NOT. NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR AGRICULTURAL LANDS SO WE HAVE A VERY UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY AND NAPA COUNTY I'M SURE THERE ARE OTHER CITIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA THAT HAVE SIMILAR SETS OF CIRCUMSTANCES THAT. THEY DON'T WANT TO SEE VIABLE AG LAND CONVERTED TO HOUSING IF IT IS AFFORDABLE SO WE ARE TRYING TO FIND ALL THE OPPORTUNITIES ARE SHORT OF THAT TO BRING THE HOUSING NEEDS TO OUR OUR COUNTY. JUST AT THAT TYPICALLY THOSE TYPES OF PLANTS THEY DON'T EVEN MAKE IT ONTO THE LIST BECAUSE FOR WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT AS FAR SURPLUS PUBLIC LANDS IT NEEDS TO BE IDENTIFIED AS SURPLUS NO LONGER NEEDED FOR. WHATEVER USE THAT WAS PURCHASED FOR AGRICULTURAL LANDS TEND TO BE A PROTECTED USE AND THAT'S NOT SOMETHING DIED WE LOOK AT OUR OUR DEVELOPERS ARE TYPICALLY INTERESTED IN. AMIR DUNBAR I FIRST OF ALL PER SHEET THE LEAGUE AND YOUR PERSONAL A SUPPORT OF THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER. BUT I DO I'D LIKE YOU TO COMMENT WE HEARD FROM MISTER KINNEY ABOUT THE PROCESS AT THIS GOING TO HAPPEN I ASK YOU TO. YOU KNOW IN VISION AND GIVE ME YOUR THàNH YEAH WHAT THE COMMUNITY YOUR COMMUNITY AND OTHER COMMUNITIES FOR EXAMPLE OF THIS PROCESS THE HAPPENS BEYOND THE OROVILLE AREA WITH REGARD TO THE- TO THE VETERANS HOME AND- IN ADDING THAT IS THAT GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO BE. THE DIFFICULT FOR THE COUNCIL TO GRAPPLE WHETHER YOU'RE PLANNING DEPARTMENT OR- AT THE FIRST THE- YEAH THAT NIMBY FACTOR. BEING PLAYED OUT. WELL THERE'RE IS AS I MENTIONED FOR AT LEAST THREE YEARS IF NOT MORE I'VE BEEN WORKING ON ELIMINATING ANY TYPE OF EITHER HESITATION OR NEGATIVITY ABOUT BRINGING HOUSING TO THE VETERANS HOME ONE OF THE WAYS THAT HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IS PRIORITIZING THAT HOUSING FOR LOWER INCOME LEVEL WORKFORCE PRINCIPALLY THE CARE GIVERS AT THE VETERANS HOME ITSELF SECONDARILY I SEE IT IN THIS IS MY VISION THEN REACH OUT TO HOMELESS VETERANS PROVIDING LONG TERM OR TRANSITIONAL HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES. TO CONTINUE THE MISSION. OF SERVING VETERANS ON THAT PARTICULAR PROPERTY BUT FROM THE VERY GROUND LEVEL AND YOUNG FILL ALL THE WAY UP TO YOUR OFFICE IN OTHERS HERE IN SACRAMENTO THERE'S UNIVERSAL SUPPORT WE ALL RECOGNIZE. THE NEED FOR MORE HOUSING ESPECIALLY BELOW MARKET RATE WE HAVE THE STATE SUPPORT THROUGH TOOLS AS A REFERENCE I GUESS BE FIVE AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES THAT HAVE NOT BEEN AVAILABLE TO US AT THE LOCAL LEVEL BEFORE AND SO. EVERYONE FROM LOCAL FOUNDATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN OF FUNDING HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS TO NONPROFIT COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATIONS ARE SCHOOL DISTRICTS LAW ENFORCEMENT PUBLIC EDUCATION ALL LEVELS HAVE SHOWN SUPPORT AND INTEREST AND THEY JUST CONTINUE TO ASK ME WHY AREN'T WE ALREADY DIGGING SHOVELS ON THE GROUND AND I SAID WELL I'M- COMING TO SACRAMENTO TO FIND OUT. YEAH WHAT YOU SAID THERE ARE ALSO GOT ME TO BE THINKING ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT I WAS COUNTY SUPERVISOR WE HAD DIFFICULTY DOING. A WORK FORCE HOUSING. WHERE YOU TARGET. HOUSING BECAUSE OF LAWS THAT DON'T ALLOW YOU TO TARGET LIKE A COMPANY THAT'S GONNA WANT TO DO AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR EXAMPLE COMPANY THAT'S COMING INTO THE AREA IT'S A REQUIREMENT THAT THEY SET ASIDE LAND AVAILABLE FOR HOUSING TRYING TO BUILD SOME HOUSING OR GET SOME OFF SITE HOUSING. BUT IT'S VERY VERY DIFFICULT TO BE ABLE TO SAY. THIS HOUSE A IS FOR YELLED DEPLOYS THIS COMPANY FIRST BEFORE ANYBODY ELSE COULD BE CONSIDERED MOREOVER I HEARD MISTER SAKE AND MISTER KINNEY TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW. JOB CENTERS HAVING IT THESE AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS BEING CLOSE TO EDUCATION CENTERS AND JOB CENTERS IT MAY BE SOMETHING WORSE SOME POLICY CHANGE HERE AT THE LEGISLATIVE LEVEL TO ALLOW SOME OF THESE PLACES TO BE ABLE TO DIRECT. HOUSING TO CERTAIN GROUPS YEAH MAYBE SOMETHING THAT WE MIGHT WANT TO DO AND I'D LIKE TO GET YOUR YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT ALL OF YOU. YEAH I MEAN IT'S SOMETHING. THAT WE'D BE INTERESTED IN EXPLORING AND CERTAINLY WOULDN'T WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE PARTICULAR GROUPS THE NEED TO BE TARGETED AND FOCUSED ON FOR FERTILIZING AS I SAID IN MY REMARKS. WERE THING ABOUT PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND FOLKS AT THE- SORT OF THE BOTTOM OF THE INCOME LEVEL PEOPLE EXT AT 50% OF THE ARMENIAN MEDIAN INCOME AND BELOW AND I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY MANY MANY IF NOT NEARLY ALL OF THOSE FOLKS ARE ALSO PART OF THE WORK FORCE THEY MAY BE WORKING MINIMUM WAGE JOBS. MULTIPLE JOBS BUT THEY ARE FOLKS. AND ARE ARE WORKING AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE ECONOMY AND ARE PROVIDING CRITICAL SERVICES IN OUR COMMUNITIES. SO YOU KNOW THAT THOSE ARE FOLKS WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO TARGET WHILE ALSO THINKING ABOUT SPECIFIC POPULATIONS AND I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY WHAT YOU HAVE IN MIND BUDGET LET'S JUST TAKE FOR EXAMPLE IN THE OUGHT FILL FOR FROM YOU KNOW IF YOU THAT'S THAT STATE WORKERS THAT ARE WORKING THERE AND- VERY MUCH IN NEED OF. AFFORDABLE HOUSING THEY MEET ALL THE CRITERIA AND THEN YOU HAVE SOMEBODY FROM LIKE COUNTY FOR EXAMS. NO OFFENSE TO ANYBODY FROM LIKE COUNTY I'M JUST TALKING ABOUT TRAFFIC. YOU KNOW GOING FROM YOUR BILL ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE NAPA VALLEY ALL THE WAY UP DANGEROUS. YOU KNOW ROADS I THINK LOOKING AT SOME OF THESE THINGS IS. YOU KNOW IT IT I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO SOLVE OTHER ISSUES LIKE WE HAVE A TRAFFIC ISSUES IN THOSE TYPE OF THINGS SO WE HAVE JOBS SHE ADDS WE OUGHT TO BE LOOKING AT THOSE TYPE OF PARAMETERS WERE MORE PLANNING. AND REAL QUICK AND BEFORE. REMARKS BUT WE WOULD MEAN A HOUSING CALIFORNIA CERTAINLY AGREES AND THERE WERE THERE WERE COMMENTS ABOUT THIS FROM H. CITY INTO GS AS WELL AS FROM THE MAYOR. ABOUT THE AND. AS WELL AS YOU CHAIR DOT ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF PLACING. APPROXIMATE TO TRANSIT WALKABLE COMMUNITIES ALL OF THAT REDUCES VMT IS REDUCES GHG EMISSIONS IN FACT THERE WAS ANOTHER REPORT DON ALSO BY THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING PARTNERSHIP ALONG WITH TRANSFORM THAT SHOWED THAT WHEN YOU PLACE. FOR MORE HOUSING NEAR TRANSIT YOU GET THE BEST BANG FOR YOUR BUCK IN TERMS OF REDUCING GHG EMISSIONS AND VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED A COMPARED TO WHEN YOU PLACE HOUSING THAT SERVES HIGHER INCOME POPULATION SO MERELY BY PLACING. DEEPLY AFFORDABLE HOUSING NEAR TRANSIT YOU ARE GETTING THOSE ENVIRONMENTAL OUTCOMES AS WELL. ENOUGH THANK YOU YES SIR THE ONLY THING THAT I WOULD ADD TO DAVID'S EXCELLENT TESTIMONY IS THAT. THE STATE ALREADY DOES PRIORITIZE AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF PROFESSIONS SO FOR INSTANCE BUILDING TEACHER HOUSING OR FARM WORKER HOUSING YOU CAN BUILD ON SCHOOL PROPERTY FOR INSTANCE IF YOU HAVE A SCHOOL DISTRICT YOU NEED TO EDUCATOR YOU NEED TO HOUSE YOUR EDUCATORS AND YOUR STAFF AND IF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT USES TO DO THAT. YOU CAN DO THE HOUSING TARGETED TO THAT SEGMENT YOU CAN ALSO TARGET VETERANS AND YOU CAN ALSO TARGET FARMWORKERS AND SO THERE IS PRECEDENT IN STATE LAW THAT ALLOWS FOR THAT TARGETING. BUT IT I GUESS MORE BROADLY SPEAKING WE DO NEED ALL OF THE ABOVE APPROACHES AND ACTUALLY THE COUNTY OF NAPA HAS AN EXCELLENT PROGRAM THE WORK FORCE HOUSING PROXIMITY PROGRAM THAT KEEPS DOWN PAYMENT ASSISTANCE FOR PEOPLE WHO LIVE WITHIN A CERTAIN RADIUS OF THEIR JOBS AND WORK IN NAPA AND NAPA COUNTY. AND SO AND SO WE BELIEVE THAT WE NEED ALL OF THAT. TO REALLY AND NAY ABLE FOLKS TO LIVE CLOSE TO WHERE THEY. THANK YOU AND I WOULD ADD TO THAT AS WELL THAT. I THINK WHAT'S HAPPENED IS WE'RE SEEING THROUGHOUT THE STATUS THERE'S BEEN. PAIN LEVEL THAT HAS BECOME A CUTE SO THAT WE'RE SEEING BUSINESSES CLOSE WE'RE SEEING SCHOOLS CLOSE. WE'RE WE'RE SEEING THE REAL IMPACTS AND UNFORTUNATELY IT HAS TAKEN SOME PERIOD OF TIME. BEFORE ALL INDUSTRIES AND ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT THE DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY HAVE IDENTIFIED THIS IS A CRITICAL PRIORITY. NOT JUST A NAPA COUNTY BY USING MY EXAMPLE I REACH OUT OF THE WORK FORCE ALLIANCE OF THE NORTH BAY TO BRING THE VOCATIONAL COMPONENT TO THE HOUSING PROJECTS NAPA VALLEY COLLEGE BRINGING TE EDUCATIONAL PIECE SO. THIS IS OF A MULTI LAYERED SOLUTION THAT'S WHAT WE REALLY NEED TO DO TO MAKE THE HOUSING NOT ONLY EXIST BUT TO MAKE IT EVEN MORE BENEFICIAL THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY. OF HAVING THE STATE'S PARTICIPATION IN ALLOWING THE PRICING TO CALM DOWN WHETHER IT'S THROUGH THE ACCESS STATE PROPERTY CERTAINLY THAT'S A CRITICAL PIECE BUT ALSO OTHER. REVENUES THAT ARE BEING MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH LEGISLATION ARE GOING TO ALLOW US TO HAVE. LOW INCOME VERY LOW INCOME BELOW MARKET RATE WHICH IS SO CRITICAL TO OUR WORK FORCE TO GETTING YOUNG FAMILIES TO BE ABLE TO EITHER RENT OR OWN SO THEY CAN START BEING. OWNERS OF HOUSING THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. THANKS TO ALL THREE OF YOU FOR YOUR EXCELLENT TESTIMONY APPRECIATED VERY MUCH WE'RE GONNA GO TO PUBLIC COMMENT AT THIS TIME IS THERE ANY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC IT'S HERE. THEY WOULD LIKE TO WEIGH IN. PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND WHERE YOU'RE FROM REPRESENT. SIR CAN USE A MICROPHONE RIGHT UP YOUR POLICE. YOU CAN USE THAT ONE THAT'S FINE. HELLO THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY MY NAME IS ROSS ROMERO I'M FROM ORANGE COUNTY CALIFORNIA. I HAD BEEN A REAL TO THEIR FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS. CRAXI WILL IN ANAHEIM NORTH ORANGE COUNTY AREA AND I'VE ALSO BEEN A HOUSING ADVOCATE. CURRENTLY I DO SO TO FACT SIT ON THE BOARD OF A NONPROFIT HOUSING CORPORATION IN SANTA ANA CALIFORNIA CIVIC CENTER MARIO HOUSING. ANYWAY. I JUST WANTED TO SAY THERE WAS A MENTION HERE OF THE WORD. CRISIS AND WE ARE IN FACT IN A CRISIS IN ORANGE COUNTY VOTE JUST TO GIVE A LITTLE INSIGHT. AFFORDABLE IS ANYTHING UNDER NINETY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. SO WE TALK AFFORDABLE IN ORANGE COUNTY WE'RE TALKING A FAMILY OF FOUR THE MAKES LESS THAN NINETY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. AS WE KNOW STATEWIDE RENTS HAVE BEEN DRAMATICALLY INCREASED. HOMEOWNERSHIP IS NEAR. VERY DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN. AND I JUST I'M NOT GONNA SAY MUCH MORE THAN WHAT THEY SAID. BUT THERE IS ONE ISSUE HERE YOU GUYS WITH THE STATE NOW HAS THIS LAND. THE GOVERNOR HAS DESIGNATED THIS LAND ONE OF THE PROBLEM IS LIKE AN ORANGE COUNTY. WE'RE BUILT OUT. THERE IS NO MORE LAND FIVE THERE THERE SINCE I WAS NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE. I'VE BEEN A REAL TO THEIR TWENTY FIVE PLUS YEARS ANYTHING ANY HOUSING THAT HAPPENS IN ORANGE COUNTY. IS GONNA BE UP MORE LAND. I THINK THE SAME HOLDS TRUE YOU KNOW IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY EVEN MORE SO EVERYTHING IS GOING UP THERE'S A MORE LAND. SO WITH THIS INITIATIVE YOU HAVE THE WHERE WITH ALL. YOU KNOW TO PUT TO RENEW EASE SOME OF THE PRESSURE DO WE ARE SEEN IN THE URBAN AREAS AS WAS MENTIONED BY THESE GENTLEMEN IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. BUT AS WE SEE VERY VERY MUCH SO ALSO IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND SO I DON'T IT'S A GREAT INITIATIVE.
