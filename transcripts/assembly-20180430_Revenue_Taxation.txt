GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL I'M TWENTY NINE TWENTY TWO. A WHICH WILL HELP LOW INCOME FAMILIES BECOME HOMEOWNERS I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR ITS EFFORTS. ON WORKING WITH US AND WE ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS. AS. THE COMMITTEE HAS RECOMMENDED CALIFORNIA'S FACING A HOUSING CRISIS WITH ACE WITH A SERIOUS LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOMES FOR A WORKING AND MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES. ALTHOUGH THE LEGISLATURE HAS BEGUN TO RESPOND TO THIS CRISIS WHO POLICIES THAT PROMOTES PRIVATE INVESTMENTS OF FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING ARE STILL IN NEED THIS PROPOSAL WILL STIMULATE PRIVATE INVESTMENT. IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING ON PROJECTS THROUGH TAX CREDITS THIS TAX CREDITS WOULD BE WOULD INCENTIVIZE PRIVATE ENTITLEMENT TO CONTRIBUTE TO QUALITY. UNQUALIFIED I'M NONPROFIT BUILDINGS HOMES OF FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES LIKE OTHER AFFORDABLE TAX CREDIT HOUSING PROGRAMS THESE PROPERTIES WILL BE LONG TERM RESALE AND DEED RESTRICTED. OF THIS. WILL ENSURE THAT THESE HOMES REMAIN AFFORDABLE AND IN OUR COMMUNITY TODAY TO SUPPLY ITS PROVIDES USE ME OF SUPPORTING TESTIMONIES IS MISS MILLER. ON THE SECOND DIRECTOR OF THE HABITAT BICU HUMANITIES GREATER SACRAMENTO. I WITNESSES WE ASK YOU KEEP YOUR COMMENTS TO THREE THREE WITNESSES THREE MINUTES PLEASE. OKAY. ADAM TURNED MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE MY NAME'S LIAM MILLER AND THE EXECUTOR ACTOR OF HABITAT FOR HUMANITY HERE IN SACRAMENTO. I'M HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF HABITAT FOR HUMANITY CALIFORNIA THE STATE SUPPORT ORGANIZATION REPRESENTING FORTY TWO AFFILIATES THROUGH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND WHERE THE SPONSOR OF THIS MEASURE AS YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA REMAINS IN STATE OF CRISIS WHEN IT COMES TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING. HOWEVER HOMEOWNERSHIP RATE SPECIFICALLY AS ARE THE LOWEST SINCE THE NINETEEN FORTIES AND TWELVE OF THE TOP FIFTEEN MOST EXPENSIVE HOUSING MARKETS REMAIN HERE IN CALIFORNIA. HABITAT FOR HUMANITY OTHER MANY OTHER NOT FOR PROFIT HOME BUILDERS HAVE BEEN CREATING AFFORDABLE HOMEOWNERSHIP OPPORTUNITIES FOR WORKING LOWER INCOME FAMILIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA FOR MANY YEARS. BERMAN CONSULATE CHALLENGED BY THE RISING COST OF LAND AND CONSTRUCTION IN SACRAMENTO AND THROUGHOUT THE STATE THE GREATEST HURDLE THAT TO BUILDING MORE HOMES AS FINANCING AND THIS HURDLE. INCLUDE STATE LOCAL AND FEDERAL FUNDS BUT ALSO FINDING MONEY TO CLOSE THE GAP ON THAT HOUSING. AND IN SACRAMENTO SPECIFICALLY I'M ONE OF OUR GREATEST CHALLENGES IS THAT WE DO HAVE LAND TO BUILD ON THAT BUT THE COST OF BUILDING THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS SO GREAT. THAT TO THIS TIME WHERE BUILDING ONES INTO THE KIND OF COME SINGLE FAMILY HOMES AND THAT WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD EVEN GREATER TO MAKE A GREATER IMPACT BY BUILDING MULTI FAMILY IS A LOT OF OUR AFFILIATES DO ACROSS THE STATE. ONE OF OUR BIGGEST CHALLENGES I THINK IT'S PUTTING A FACE TO THE NAME OF THE FAMILIES THAT WE DO SERVE THOSE FAMILIES OFTENTIMES OF THOSE THAT ARE. THOSE LOW INCOME HARD WORKING FAMILIES THAT YOU MIGHT NOT SEE ON THE STREET IS HOMELESS BUT THEY ARE ON THE VERGE OF HOMELESSNESS. AND OUT ONE STRAIGHT LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU IS OUT THAT OF JIMMY AND PETTY GARRIDO'S IN A STORY THAT WAS MOST RECENTLY FEATURED ON. AND PR THEY LIVE IN SOUTH LOS A LOS ANGELES AND DAMN THEY HAVE HOLES IN THEIR IN THEIR WALLS WHERE AM IN RECENT STORMS HAVE SOAKED THROUGH AND DAMAGE THEIR DRY WALL. AND THEY PUT DECORATIONS OVER THEM IN ORDER TO COVER UP THOSE HOLES THEY HAVE RODENT INFESTATIONS THEY CURRENTLY PAY SEVENTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS AND. AND RENTS EACH MONTH FOR THEIR FAMILY OF FOUR IN A TWO BEDROOM HOUSE AND WERE RECENTLY TOLD THAT THEIR BUILDING WAS TO BE SOLD IN SOUTHERN LOOKING FOR A NEW PLACE TO LIVE AND UNABLE TO FIND ANYTHING LESS THAN THREE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH. AND THE LOOK AT BEING FORCED TO MOVE SEVENTY MILES OUT OF TOWN TO THEN HAVE TO UPROOT THEIR FAMILY THE SCHOOL WHERE THEIR DAUGHTER GOES TO SCHOOL IS AN HONOR STUDENT THE ALL THREE OF THE DOLLARS HONOR STUDENTS. AND SO THEY CAN FIND AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND BE ABLE TO COME BACK INTO THE CITY TO THEIR JOBS WERE THEIR ASSISTANT MANAGERS AT A PIZZERIA. THIS IS THIS THAT AN ONGOING SORT OF. PICTURE OF THE FAMILIES THAT WE SERVE THAT NEED AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN OUR COMMUNITIES NOT JUST HERE IN SACRAMENTO BUT ACROSS OUR STATE. AND THE NEED TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS NOT JUST A CRISIS FOR THIS FAMILY IT'S AN EPIDEMIC ACROSS OUR STATE. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT. WE MOST RECENTLY SAW THAT. THAT ONE HALF OF ALL CALIFORNIANS SPEND MORE THAN THIRTY PERCENT OF THEIR INCOME ON RENT AND ONE THIRD OF ALL HOUSEHOLDS IN CALIFORNIA SPEND MORE THAN FIFTY PERCENT. THIS BILL WOULD HELP PROVIDE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR. INCREASED CAPACITY WITH AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND BRINGING AND PARTNERS TO HELP CLOSE THAT GAP. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO BEING ABLE TO PARTNER WITH YOU IN ORDER TO HELP MAKE THAT POSSIBLE. HOLLY FOR MANY WITH WHITE HOUSE PUBLIC AFFAIRS ON BEHALF A HABITAT FOR MANY CALIFORNIAN I'M JUST HERE FOR ON TECHNICAL SUPPORT OF THE COMMITTEE HAVE QUESTIONS THANK YOU. OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT IS. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE. BUT QUIRK. SO FOR HABITAT FOR HUMANITY YOU HAVE A WONDERFUL PROGRAM. AND. YOU ARE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT HOW MUCH PEOPLE CAN PAY. AND. YOU ALSO HAVE RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL FOR. ONCE THE MORTGAGE IS GONE OUT THE PROBLEM IS THAT THIS. MONEY COULD GO TO PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE THOSE. GUARANTEES AND I THINK WE WOULD BE BETTER OFF SIMPLY PUTTING THE MONEY IN THE BUDGET MAKING SURE IT GOES TO GOOD ACTORS. LIKE. HABITAT FOR HUMANITY THAT'S MY CONCERN. I'M I THINK I'M NOT SURE I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND QUESTION BUT THE WAY THE I'M BILL IS WRITTEN IS THAT IT IT IT WILL GO TOWARDS THE NONPROFIT THAT ARE. THE GOOD ACTORS THEY'RE THE ONES THAT HAVE THAT. AND WE HAVE THE FIVE A TWENTY THREE STATUS. AND CHARITABLE STATUS. IT'S WELL FEDERAL PROVIDING HOMEOWNERSHIP AND JUST FOR THE THIRTY TO PRETTY EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE AM I. WELL. THE THE POINT HERE IS THOUGH THAT. IF YOU HAVE A DIRECT GRANT PROGRAM. STATE HAS MORE CONTROL ABOUT WHO WOULD GOES TO WHEN THEY CAN GO TO THE BETTER ACTOR. AND AND THAT'S A CONCERN I. I ALMOST NEVER VOTE FOR ANYTHING IN THIS COMMITTEE SORRY. WELL I I THINK ONE OF THAT. WITHOUT OF LOOK AT THEM LOOKING AT THE CUT CAUCUS CONSULTANT BUT I THINK THERE WERE SOME FOLKS HAVE. IN OUR WHAT COURSE FOR SUPPORT OF THE GRANT PROGRAM THAT. THE WAY THIS BILL IS SET UP AS TO WHERE IT'S FIFTY PERCENT CREDIT SO IT'LL ACTUALLY BE MORE LEVERAGE ABLE PRIVATE DOLLARS. WITH THE MATCH OF THE STATE INSTEAD OF IT BEING A HUNDRED PERCENT SO ACTUALLY THEORETICALLY IT WILL BRING MORE MONEY INTO ARE PROJECTS. THAN IT WOULD IF IT WERE GRANT PROGRAM BECAUSE OF THE MATCH OKAY WELL LET ME KNOW GETTING MORE MONEY FOR PROJECTS THAT IF IT WERE JUST A DIRECT GRANT PROGRAM. OKAY WELL LET'S GOOD ANSWER TO MY QUESTION THANK YOU. WELL WE HAVE A QUORUM WOULD LIKE TO CALL THE ROLL. BURKE HERE. BRO HERE. BONTA CHIU. GRAY HAIR. MCCARTY. LANDIS MULLIN. QUIRK. HERE. VOEPEL.

THAT BILL IS OUT EIGHT ZERO MOVING TO FILE ITEM THREE AB TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE MISTER PERRIN WOULD LIKE TO OPEN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES I COME BEFORE YOU TODAY TO PRESENT AB TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE THE BILL TO MODERNIZE THE SHARING OF INFORMATION BETWEEN ASSESSORS AND TAXPAYERS. I WOULD LIKE TO START BY THINKING COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THE THOROUGH ANALYSIS IN FOR FACILITATING CONVERSATIONS THAT WILL MAKE THIS BILL MUCH BETTER. ACCORDINGLY I'M HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS OUTLINED IN THE ANALYSIS ON THE BOTTOM OF PAGE FIVE AND TOP OF PAGE SIX. INCREASINGLY DOCUMENTS CAN BE PROVIDED BY ASSESSORS AND TAXPAYERS BY A MORE EFFICIENT AND COST EFFECTIVE MEANS BY MAIL AND IN SOME INSTANCES ELECTRONIC SHARING MAY BE AN OPTION. UNFORTUNATELY EXISTING LAWS WOEFULLY OUT OF DATE. AS MY COUNTY ASSESSOR LARRY STONE CAN SHARE THERE BEEN TIMES WHEN HIS STAFF HAS UNNECESSARILY BEEN FORCED TO TRAVEL TO VARIOUS LOCATIONS AROUND THE STATE. TO OBTAIN THE INFORMATION NECESSARY TO DO HIS JOB. AS AMENDED IT THIS BILL WILL CODIFY THE EXISTING PRACTICE OF TRANSMITTING INFORMATION VIA THE MAIL AS WELL AS ALLOW FOR THE RECIPROCAL RIGHT FOR ASSESSORS AND TAXPAYERS TO RECEIVE INFORMATION WHEN IT IS AVAILABLE IN ELECTRONIC FORMAT. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THAT WE SHOULD EMBRACE TECHNOLOGY AS A MEANS OF INCREASING GOVERNMENT EFFICIENCY. THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT AB TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE WOULD ACCOMPLISH AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE IN WITH ME TODAY IS A LARRY STONE ASSESSOR SANTA CLARA COUNTY. THANK YOU. I'M LARRY STONE I'M SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSESSORS ASSOCIATION AND IN MY CAPACITY AS A SANTA CLARA COUNTY ASSESSOR. AB TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE DOES ONE THING. ONLY ONE THING. IT ALLOWS FOR THE ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION OF DOCUMENTS BETWEEN A TAXPAYER AND THE ASSESSOR. IT ISN'T THAT SIMPLE. IN ORDER TO RENDER A FAIR AND ACCURATE ASSESSMENT OF COMMERCIAL PROPERTY ASSESSORS NEED TO HAVE. AND HAVE THE LEGAL RIGHT TO REQUEST AND RECEIVE BASIC INFORMATION SUCH AS RENTS VACANCIES INVOICES AND SO FORTH. ALL OF THIS IS HELD IN STRICT CONFIDENCE. CURRENTLY THE LAW WRITTEN DECADES AGO BEFORE THE INTERNET AND EMAIL SPECIFIES ONLY ONE METHOD. TRAVELLING TO A TAXPAYERS PLACE OF BUSINESS. CLEARLY IT'S IT'S IT'S EXPENSIVE AND VERY INEFFICIENT FOR APPRAISERS IN AUDITOR'S TO TRAVEL TO A CORPORATION'S HEADQUARTERS. FREQUENTLY OUT OF STATE SUCH AS IBM IN NEW YORK. SOUTHWEST AIRLINES IN TEXAS TO RECEIVE IMPORTANT INFORMATION NECESSARY FOR A FAIR AND EQUITABLE ASSESSMENT WHEN THIS SAME INFORMATION IS READILY AVAILABLE AND CAN BE TRANSMITTED ELECTRONICALLY. MODERNIZING OUR OUR QUE CODE IS SIMPLY ABOUT EFFICIENT GOVERNMENT NOTHING MORE. ASSESSORS HAVE WORKED CLOSELY WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN. AND CAL TAX A CLARIFYING IMPROVE THE BILL FOR EXAMPLE THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER HAS AGREED TO TAKE AMENDMENTS SUGGESTED BY CAL TAX WHICH WILL ALLOW THE TRANSMISSION OF. DOCUMENTS FROM A TAXPAYER TOO ASSESSOR AND. AND FROM THE ASSESSOR TO A TAXPAYER. A TWO WAY STREET. FAIR ENOUGH. AB TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE ALLOWS FOR THE ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION OF INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTS ONLY. UNDERSCORE ONLY WHEN THEY ARE AVAILABLE IN ELECTRONIC FORMAT. IF IT'S NOT AVAILABLE FROM THE TAXPAYERS TAXPAYERS CAN USE U. S. MAIL OR PRIVATE DELIVERY SERVICES SUCH AS FED EX AND UPS WERE NOT IN EXISTENCE WHEN THE CODE WAS WRITTEN DECADES AGO. AB TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE HAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES PROCESS THAT'S CURRENTLY GOING ON AT THE BE. WE. NOTHING ELSE CHANGES BUT THAT THE ABILITY TO TRANSMIT DOCUMENTS AND INFORMATION ELECTRONICALLY. BECAUSE PROPERTY TAXES ARE THE BACKBONE OF FUNDING FOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES I URGE THE COMMITTEE TO SUPPORT A. B.. TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE. THINK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SAYING I HOPE YOU COME. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MARKUP PREY ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA LINES OF TAXPAYER ADVOCATES. ARE RATHER THAN TAKING UP THE COMMITTEE'S TIME WITH MY TESTIMONY. THE. TWO MEMBERS OF KATO WILL BE TESTIFYING AND LET'S START OFF WITH THEIR SHAUN KEEGAN WHO IS THE CHAIR OF KATO. THANK YOU MARK. GOOD AFTERNOON. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME SHAUN KEEGAN AMIS ACTIVE VICE PRESIDENT PRINCIPLE OF PROPERTY TAX ASSIST COMPANY. I'M ALSO THE CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA LINES OF TAXPAYER ADVOCATES OF THE ACRONYM IS KATE. KATE IS A NONPROFIT TRADE ASSOCIATION MADE OF TAX CONSULTANTS AND OTHER PROFESSIONALS. REPRESENTING TAXPAYERS BEFORE COUNTY ASSESSOR'S. COUNTY ASSESSMENT APPEALS BOARD AND THE STATE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION. KATE IS PURPOSE IS TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF CALIFORNIA PROPERTY TAXPAYERS. THAT'S ONE OF THE MANY REASONS WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY. CAN'T BELIEVE THE COUNTY ASSESSOR SHOULD HAVE THE INFORMATION NECESSARY TO MAKE FAIR AND ACCURATE ASSESSMENTS. NO DISAGREEMENT THERE. WELL THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS CORRECTLY ADDRESSED ISSUE OF INFORMATION REQUEST. RECIPROCITY. IT DID NOT ADDRESS ANY OF THE OTHER ISSUES WE RAISE OUR MARCH THIRTIETH LETTER. WHAT WE OBJECT TO OUR INFORMATION REQUEST THAT ARE SO OVERLY BROAD? AN UNREASONABLE THAT THE TAXPAYER CANNOT SATISFY THE INFORMATION REQUESTS. WERE SO BURDENSOME. THE TAXPAYER GIVES UP ITS APPEAL RENTS UP SO FRUSTRATED. IN HAVING A HEARING BEFORE THIS US APPEALS BOARD DENIED OR DELAYED FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. WE HAVE EXAMPLES WHERE THESE LETTERS. HAVE NUMEROUS REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION. THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF DOCUMENTS REQUESTED. THERE'S NOTHING IN AB TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE OR THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS THAT ADDRESSES THIS ISSUE. ACTUALLY AB TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE MASQUERADES. AS A FIX OUR MODERNIZATION. YOU PUT YOUR FINGER ON PAGE FIVE F.. FOR INSTANCE. IT HAS BEEN EVEN PUT IN THE PAPERWORK THAT IT. FOR FORTY ONE QUE. ACTUALLY TALKS ABOUT THE SUBMISSION OF INFORMATION IN ELECTRONIC FORMAT. IT'S ALREADY THERE. HOWEVER AB TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE BECOMES EFFECTIVE OR IF THESE CHANGES GO THROUGH WE'RE GONNA CHANGE THREE OTHER CODE SECTIONS THAT AFFECT THE TAXPAYER. AND THERE PROTECTIONS. SO HOW DID WE GET HERE FIRST IT'S IMPORTANT REMEMBER. THAT IN ANY DISPUTE. WITH THE COUNTY ASSESSOR THE TAXPAYER HAS THE BURDEN OF PROOF. THEY HAVE TO SHOW TWO THINGS. ASSESSORS PROPERTY TAX ASSESSMENT IS INCORRECT OR WRONG. THAT THE TAXPAYERS OPINION OF THE FAIR MARKET VALUE IS CORRECT WHICH IS THE SECOND ITEM THEY HAVE TO PROVE. FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS KITA ORGANIZATIONS URGE COUNTY ASSESSORS INDIVIDUALLY. AND COLLECTIVELY TO STOP THREATENING TAXPAYERS WITH CRIMINAL. AND CIVIL. SANCTIONS. ON THE FIRST REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ON THE FIRST REQUEST FOR INFORMATION AFTER ASSESSMENT IN MOST CASES WAS ALREADY MAY. WE'RE PLEASED THAT SINCE THE END OF LAST YEAR THE ASSESSORS CALIFORNIA SUCH ASSOCIATION. HAVE SEE SUCH PRACTICE THEY POLICE THEIR OWN. WE'VE ACTUALLY CHANGE LETTERS. THE REAL ISSUE IS THAT THE COUNTY ASSESSOR'S ON THE ASSESSMENT PEELS BOARD. OR VIOLATING THE TAXPAYERS DUE PROCESS BY UNREASONABLY DELAYING OR DENYING A HEARING BEFORE THE ASSESSMENT PEELS BOARD. UNTIL ALL THIS INFORMATION IS PRODUCED. THEREFORE THERE'S NO STATUTORY RIGHT TO AND RECENTLY DELAY OR DENY HEARING BEFORE THE ASSESSMENT FEELS FOR. THAT HAS BEEN CATERS FOCUS ALL ALONG. THE TOPIC WAS DISCUSSED FOR OVER FOUR HOURS LAST WEEK AND FOUR. WITH THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION INTERESTED PARTY MEETING. WHAT WAS CLEAR IS THAT OTHER THAN GOING TO COURT THERE'S NO SIMPLE WAY FOR TAXPAYERS CHALLENGE? ASSESSORS OVERLY BROAD OR RUN REASONABLE REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION. ACCORDING TO THE BEAT WE REPORT ON WORKLOADS AND ASSESSMENT PEELS ACTIVITIES AND CALIFORNIA. TWO DOZEN FIFTEEN TO SIXTEEN. HUNDRED TWO THOUSAND SEVEN APPEALS WERE FILED. THIRTY NINE PERCENT OF THOSE WERE WITHDRAWN FOR REASONS UNKNOWN. IT IS ARE EXPERIENCE AS A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER THESE APPEALS FOR WITH PARTICULARLY BY SMALL BUSINESSMEN. BECAUSE THE INFORMATION REQUESTS ARE OVERLY BROAD AND REASONABLE RATHER THAN FIGHT THE ASSESSOR THEY JUST GAVE UP. SO IT'S ONLY THE REGULATION OR STATUTE. THERE IS AN EFFICIENT WAY FOR TAXPAYERS TO CHALLENGE THESE ASSESSORS OVERLY BROAD AND REASON REQUEST FOR INFORMATION. WE THEREFORE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT YOU. VOTE NO ON AB TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE AND THANK YOU FOR THE EXTRA TIME MINIATURE. NEXT WITNESS. GOOD AFTERNOON AND CHAIRMAN. CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS MIKE MIDDLETON AND I AM THE PRESIDENT OF PROTECTS LLC. HAVE ALSO BEEN A MEMBER OF KATO FOR THE PAST SEVEN YEARS AND AN ACTIVE MEMBER OF CADIZ STANDARDS COMMITTEE. PRO TAX LLC HAS BEEN IN BUSINESS SINCE NINETEEN NINETY. AND WE REPRESENT TAXPAYERS IN NEARLY EVERY COUNTY WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. OUR FIRM HAS FILED APPROXIMATELY FOUR THOUSAND FORMAL APPEAL APPLICATIONS ANNUALLY OVER THE PAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS. THE MAJORITY OF OUR CLIENTS INCLUDE SMALL TO MEDIUM SIZE BUSINESS OWNERS. OVER THE YEARS WE HAVE REALIZED THAT THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OBSTACLE FACING MANY OF THESE TAXPAYERS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. IS THAT OF DUE PROCESS. IN OTHER WORDS WHO CONTROLS AT TAXPAYERS ACCESS TO RECEIVE A TIMELY HEARING BEFORE AN ASSESSMENT APPEALS BOARD. AB TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE PROVIDES TWO RATHER SIMPLE BUT HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES THAT WILL RESTRICT A TAXPAYERS RIGHT TO A TIMELY ASSESSMENT APPEAL HEARING. THE FIRST AMENDMENT. IT'S TO ADD LANGUAGE UNDER SECTION FOUR FORTY ONE D. THAT WOULD NOW REQUIRE AN APPLICANT TO PROVIDE INFORMATION REQUESTED BY THE ASSESSOR. VIA MAIL OR ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION. ALTHOUGH MANY APPLICANTS DO SO AND IT'S IN THEIR BEST INTEREST TO DO SO IN ORDER TO RECEIVE A REDUCTION THERE IS NO SUCH REQUIREMENT THAT EXISTS TODAY. THE SECOND AMENDMENT TO SECTION FOUR SEVENTY SIX TO STRIKE THE LANGUAGE THAT PROVIDES ONLY THAT THE APPLICANT SHALL MAKE THE DOCUMENTS AVAILABLE TO THE ASSESSOR FOR INSPECTION AT HIS OR HER PRINCIPAL PLACE OF BUSINESS. AT FIRST GLANCE THESE CHANGES MAY APPEAR TO BE MINOR AND VERY REASONABLE. HOWEVER THESE TWO CHANGES STRATEGICALLY CHANGE THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT THAT TAXPAYERS CURRENTLY HAVE TO RECEIVE A TIMELY HEARING ON THE VALUATION OF THE PROPERTY. THE AMENDMENT ALTERS THE EXISTING NARRATIVE AND THE ASSESSOR AND OR THE ASSESSMENT APPEALS BOARD ARE GIVEN CONTROL REGARDING ACCESS OF ATTACK FOR TAXPAYER TO A TIMELY HEARING. THE TAXPAYER MAY BE REQUIRED TO ATTEND MULTIPLE HEARINGS SIMPLY TO DETERMINE IF THEY HAVE COMPLIED WITH ALL OF THE INFORMATION BEING REQUESTED FROM THE ASSESSOR WHICH IS COST PROHIBITIVE. AND MANY TAXPAYERS SIMPLY GIVE UP. ONCE AN APPEAL WAS FILED THE ASSESSOR HAS ALREADY BEEN PRESUMED TO HAVE VALUE THE PROPERTY CORRECTLY AND IN ALMOST EVERY CASE HAS RECEIVED A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF INFORMATION FROM EACH PROPERTY OWNER. REGARDING THE PROPERTY AND ITS DATA. THE BURDEN NOW IS ON THE TAXPAYER TO FIRST PROVIDE EVIDENCE THAT THE ASSESSOR'S VALUES INCORRECT. IT'S SECOND TO PROVIDE EVIDENCE OF THE ACTUAL FOR MARKET VALUE OF THEIR PROPERTY. AB TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE AS AN ADDITIONAL AN UNREASONABLE BURDEN ON THE TAXPAYER TO COMPLY WITH IN A SUCH A REQUEST FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. BEFORE THE TAXPAYER IS EVEN ENTITLED TO RECEIVE A TIMELY HEARING ON THE VALUE QUESTION. THIS AMENDMENT OR THIS. AB TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE WOULD ONLY CODIFY THE PROBLEM THE CAT A REYES WITH THE STATE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION NEARLY TWO YEARS AGO. REGARDING THE DUE PROCESS CHALLENGES THAT MANY SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS FACE TODAY. WE THEREFORE MUST RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE ON ASSESSORS BILL TWENTY AB TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE. ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION THAT AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS KATE BALLOT BEHALF OF RYAN LLC AND WOULD LIKE TO OUR SOULS PREVIOUS COME. IF YOU. QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. MR MON. THEY RAPTURED TRYING TO. GET MY HANDS AROUND THE OBJECTION HERE SO. TO ME THIS IS A FAIRLY STRAIGHTFORWARD. GOVERNMENT EFFICIENCY AND EASE OF COMPLIANCE KIND OF A THING YOU'RE SUGGESTING THAT. BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE LANGUAGE IS WRITTEN IT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO SLOW DOWN THE ASSESSMENT APPEALS. PROCESS TO BE THAT I'M HEARING LOTS OF CONCERNS WITH THE OVERALL PROCESS WHICH TO ME JUST ON THE FACE OF IT FEELS LIKE IT GOES BEYOND THE SCOPE OF THE BILL BEFORE THE COMMITTEE TODAY. YOU MAY HAVE SOME LARGER ISSUES ABOUT. THE ASSESSMENT APPEALS PROCESS WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT BE OVERLY BURDENSOME BUT BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT WE'RE GOING TO SOLVE THAT PROBLEM HERE TODAY. FROM A FROM. JUST AT THAT READ OF THE BILL IT SEEMS LIKE THIS IS FAIRLY STRAIGHTFORWARD I GUESS. MADAM CHAIR WOULD WITH YOUR PERMISSION IF IF WE ALLOW. OF THE SPONSOR OR THE AUTHOR JUST TO TALK ABOUT THIS ISSUE OF OF TIMELINESS. I DON'T FEEL GREAT ABOUT SLOWING THAT PROCESS DOWN BUT IF THIS IS GOING TO ACTUALLY. A MAKE GOVERNMENT MORE EFFICIENT. ALL CERTAINLY FEEL BETTER CASTING MY AYE VOTE. WHICH I. PROBABLY WILL ANYWAY BUT. MR TENNIS CLARA COUNTY ONLY FIVE PERCENT OF ALL ASSESSMENT APPEALS FILED ACTUALLY END UP. AN INFORMAL HEARING THIS IS NOT A MAJOR PROBLEM WITH MOST TAXPAYERS. I ASSESS SOME OF THE MAJOR CORPORATIONS IN THE WORLD AND FOR IN FACT THE NUMBER ONE CORPORATION IN THE NUMBER TWO CORE. OPPRESSION WE DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT IT'S. NOTHING THAT THEY USE VIRTUALLY NOTHING THAT THEY SAID IT HAS TO DO WITH THIS BILL IT IS SIMPLE. WHETHER IN FACT YOU TRANSMIT. INFORMATION. ELECTRONICALLY OR NOT IN THE CODE ONLY LONELY PROVIDES AND IT SEEMS TO ME IF I HAVE TO GO TO NEW YORK OR TEXAS. THAT WILL LENGTHEN. THE PROCESS OF ARRIVING AT ITS HEAD HADN'T HAD A QUICK VALUE IN AN. ACCURATE ASSESSMENT. YOUR STAFF LEXIE GET ON A PLANE AND GO TO NEW YORK TO GET A DOCUMENT EVERY YEAR I SEND. AUDITOR'S. CHICAGO NEW YORK DALLAS. NO. MIAMI PLACES THAT WE HAVE TO DO AN AUDIT WELL IF SOMEBODY SAYS TO ME IF YOU WANT TO SEE. THE INFORMATION THAT YOU THEREAFTER LEGALLY. ENTITLED TO HAVE WHICH. THEY INDICATED THEY ARE YOU CAN ONLY YOU ONLY MUST COME TO OUR BUSINESS IF WE DECIDE THAT WE'RE SAYING. TRANSMITTED ELECTRONICALLY MOST COMPANIES DO ENOUGH HIM WITH A SMALL COMPANY IF THE ELECTRONIC. ACCESS DOESN'T EXIST THEN THEY CAN MAIL IT. OR. OR. USE NO FED EX SIR. UPS OR SOMETHING OF THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT MOST ALL COMPANIES DO IT SURPRISES US THAT. THESE PEOPLE WANT TO. WANT TO DELAY THE PROCESS. THERE IS A LAW THAT ALL ASSESSMENT APPEALS MUST BE RESOLVED WITHIN A TWO YEAR STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS OR THE TAXPAYERS OPINION OF VALUE AS STATED ON THE ASSESSMENT APPEALS FORM. HOLES SO THE LONGER IT CAN BE DRAGGED OUT THE MORE LIKELY IT IS WITH SOME COUNTIES NOT MY OWN BUT SOME COUNTIES. THAT THAT STATUTE WILL RUN IN THE TAXPAYERS OPINION A VALUABLE HOLE. ASSESSORS ARE VERY INTERESTED IN CLEARING ASSESSMENT APPEALS AS FAST AS WE CAN. NOT TO DELAY ANYTHING. AND THE TAXPAYERS SHOULD BE SHOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT TOO BECAUSE OFTENTIMES IT INVOLVES A REFUND. AND AND YOU DON'T BELIEVE THAT. THE EASE OF TRANSMISSION OF THESE DOCUMENTS WILL LEAD. THE ASSESSOR'S OFFICE TO BE REQUESTING MORE DOCUMENTS. SINCE THERE IS IT'S IT'S IT'S RELATIVELY EASY TO TRANSMIT ELECTRONICALLY WILL WILL THE SCOPE OF WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IN TERMS OF INFORMATION. BROUGHT IN BECAUSE OF THE. THESE WERE CREATING WITH THIS LEGISLATION. THAT WOULD NOT BE. OF INTEREST TO US WERE ONLY INTERESTED INFORMATION THAT ALLOWS US TO MAKE AN ACCURATE ASSESSMENT. NO LESS AND NO MORE. AND WE YOU KNOW A STANDARD SHOPPING CENTER OFFICE BUILDINGS WHAT DO YOU ASK FOR AS I MENTIONED. RENT ROLE VACANCIES EXPENSES ALL THE THINGS. THAT MUST BE PROVIDED. BY THE TAXPAYER IN ORDER US TO MAKE AN ACCURATE ASSESSMENT. SO WHY WE WOULD ASK FOR MORE THAN THAT MORE THAN IS WHAT'S NECESSARY OBVIOUSLY IF I'M AUDITING AND DEALING WITH AN APPEAL FROM GOOGLE OR APPLE. THERE'S A LOT MORE INFORMATION REQUESTED BY THE WAY BOTH OF THOSE COMPANIES PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION ELECTRONICALLY AND I THINK THEY WOULD BE INSULTED IF WE ASK HIM TO DO ANYTHING ELSE. MOVE THE BELL. I GOT. WE'RE GOING TO. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I WONDER IF. WE CAN NOW GET KIND OF A RESPONSE TO SOME OF THE CLAIMS THAT WERE MADE JUST SO. I'M CLEAR BECAUSE HE BROUGHT UP SOME. QUESTIONS HERE THAT. NO I'M LEAVING ONE TO THE OPPOSITION LIKE TO CLARIFY. YES I WOULD LIKE TO RESPOND THANK YOU. SO TOM THE ENTIRE ISSUE HERE IS THE ACCESS TO A HEARING. SO IF THE ASSESSOR NOW CONTROLS THE REQUESTED INFORMATION. AND THAT AN APPLICANT DOESN'T HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION THEY BECOME NON COMPLIANT. IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY THEY ACTUALLY HAVE AN AGENDA OF COMPLIANCE AND NONCOMPLIANCE TAXPAYERS SO TAX MAYOR HAVE TO MAY HAVE TO COME BACK TO THREE AND FOUR TIMES. UNTIL THEY PROVIDE ALL THE INFORMATION REQUIRED FROM AN ASSESSOR JUST TO GET EVALUATION HEARING. THAT IS NOT DUE PROCESS AND MANY OF OUR CLIENTS HAVE SIMPLY GIVEN UP I GIVE YOU A BRIEF EXAMPLE WE RECENTLY HAD A REQUEST. FOR INFORMATION WE PROVIDED I THINK FOUR OF THE SIX ITEMS ON THE ON THE REQUEST WE WERE STILL TOLD WE WERE NON COMPLIANT. NOW YOU HAVE MUST COME BACK FROM THE NOT COMPLAINING HEARING YOU'LL BE DENIED. SO WHEN YOU'RE TALKING SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS IF THEY HAVE TO SHOW UP TWO AND THREE FOUR TIMES FOR HEARINGS JUST TO DETERMINE IF THEY'RE COMPLIANT BEFORE THEY ACTUALLY GET EVALUATION HEARING. YOU'RE GONNA SEE APPEALS GO TO NOTHING AND A LOT OF UNHAPPY PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO LOSE DUE PROCESS TO GET THEIR VALUE HURT THIS IS NOT THE WAY IT'S WORKED FOR THE LAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN PRACTICING. BUT FROM NOT NOT MUCH DIFFERENT THAN WHEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER MULLIN SAYS THAT SOUNDS LIKE A SYSTEMIC PROBLEM NOT A PROBLEM ABOUT HOW THAT INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELIVER FOR THE LAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS SO RIGHT NOW IT'S BEING DELIVERED EITHER IN PERSON OR. VIA MAIL THIS IS SAYING TWO THINGS TO YOUR. POINT THIS IS SAYING TWO THINGS TO BE CLEAR WRITE THAT DOWN NOW THOSE THAT INFORMATION CAN BE DELIVERED ELECTRONICALLY. NOW IF YOU CAN GET THE INFORMATION BACK THIS DOESN'T CHANGE THAT. THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW THE OTHER THING IS THIS IS RECIPROCAL SO WHEN YOU SAY THAT THE. THAT THE CUSTOMER THE CLIENT CANNOT GET THE INFORMATION THIS IS RECIPROCAL SO IT GOES TO THE ASSESSOR AND IT CAN COME BACK AS WELL SO. I THINK WHAT YOUR WILL MY IMPRESSION OF WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IN MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE BILL THE WAY IT'S WRITTEN FROM COMMITTEE STAFF AND FOR MY OWN REVIEW IS THAT. WHAT YOU'RE DISCUSSING IS A SYSTEMIC PROBLEM NOT A PROBLEM WITH THIS ACTUAL BILL ON THE ROUTE ON THE ABILITY TO DELIVER THE THOSE DOCUMENTS VIA ELECTRONIC DELIVERY SYSTEM THIS BILL SPECIFICALLY BEING BROUGHT UP AFTER KATO BRACED OUR CONCERNS? HERE'S THE MAJOR PROBLEM WITH THIS BILL THE WORD REQUIRE. IF IT APPLICANT IS NOW REQUIRED TO PROVIDE WHATEVER LAUNDRY LIST THE ASSESSOR COMES UP WITH BEFORE THEIR RIGHT TO A HEARING. TO PROCESS IS BEING DENIED. MOST OF THE INFORMATION WE ALREADY PROVIDE ELECTRONICALLY. THIS IS NOT AN ISSUE WE ALMOST PROVIDE ALL THE TIME THE INFORMATION ELECTRONICALLY AND TO BE FAIR TO SANTA CLARA COUNTY WE WORK OUT MOST ASSESSMENTS. WE'RE HERE TALKING ABOUT THE RIGHTS OF A TAXPAYER AND IF YOU MAKE THIS REQUIREMENT WHICH ISN'T THERE NOW THAT THE ASSESSOR. KING ASKED FOR WHATEVER THEY WANT AND THEN THE APPEAL CAN BE PUT OFF BY THE APPEALS BOARD. THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO SEE A BUNCH OF PEOPLE WITHDRAW FROM THE PROCESS. THE ISSUE IS THOUGH IS THAT YOU'RE TALKING. WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT CAN HAPPEN NOW IN THE DELIVERY SYSTEM THE WAY THAT THINGS CAN BE DELIVERED NOW I THINK THAT'S WHERE. WHERE I AM I NOT GETTING IT YOU CAN STILL PEOPLE CAN STILL ACCORDING TO THE MINUTES RESTORE ASSESSOR ABILITY TO VIEW DOCUMENTS ON SITE? THAT IS STILL POSSIBLE SO WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT NOTHING IN THE LIVER DOCUMENTS THAT HAPPENS NOW YOU JUST FINISHED SAYING FOR THE LAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS. THE ELECTRONIC DELIVERY OF THOSE DOES NOT CHANGED THAT IT DOESN'T CHANGE AYE DOESN'T SOLVE YOUR PROBLEM I GET THAT. BUT IT DOESN'T CREATE AN ADDITIONAL PROBLEM IT ACTUALLY MAKES IT HOPEFUL I WOULD IMAGINE MORE EFFICIENT BECAUSE THEY CAN BE DELIVERED. IN BOTH DIRECTIONS RECIPROCALLY VIA ELECTRONIC. I'M GONNA SEE IF ANYONE ON ELSE ON THE COMMITTEE HAS A QUESTION HOLD ON ANYONE ELSE ON THE COMMITTEE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. MISTER BROWN. JUST A QUICK COMMENT COM. AND I KNOW THE ANNOUNCER SAYS AGO SO FOR NEXT WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO WORK WITH IT SOUNDS LIKE JUST A REQUIRE A WORD HERE NOW WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO WORK THE OPPOSITION HAS A MOVE FORWARD IN THE PROCESS. SO SO WE HAVE WORKED A LOT WITH WITH THE OPPONENTS KEITA IN THEIR ADVOCATES IN AND I'M GRATEFUL FOR THAT OPPORTUNITY AND I THINK THE CHANGES THAT WE'VE MADE TO MAKE THIS RECIPROCAL HAS MADE THE BILL BETTER I I DON'T KNOW I'M HAPPY TO KEEP ON TALKING WITH THEM. I DON'T KNOW THAT I CHANGE THE WORD REQUIRE AND FOR A. CERTAIN REASON WHICH IS BECAUSE WE SAY IF AVAILABLE. AND SO WE'RE NOT ASKING FOR FOR TAXPAYERS HAD TO PROVIDE ANYTHING THAT THEY DON'T ALREADY HAVE THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE ELECTRONICALLY BOTH. IT THAT ON TWICE. IN IN THE BILL IT'S SPECIFIC IN THE AMENDMENTS THAT SPECIFICALLY SAYS IF AVAILABLE I I THINK THAT THAT WOULD THAT SATISFY THEIR CONCERNS. NAM BUT HAPPY TO KEEP THE CONVERSATION GOING WITH THEM ABSOLUTELY AND FOR REVIEW FOR THE AMENDMENTS OUT LET'S JUST GO THURMOND QUICK NUMBER ONE IS RESTORE ASSESSORS ABILITY TO VIEW DOCUMENTS ON SITE. TWO IS ESTABLISHED WORSE AT RECIPROCITY BETWEEN ASSESSOR AND TAXPAYER FOR DOCUMENT TRANSMITTAL BY MAIL OR ELECTRONICALLY IF AVAILABLE. THREE ALLOW TAXPAYERS TO RECEIVE AVAILABLE AT TRONIC DOCUMENTS WITHOUT COST. NOT ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. MADAM CHAIRMAN I MAKE A COMMENT AND RESPONSE WHAT YOU WHAT YOU NEED TO HAVE A QUESTION FROM. A MEMBER. THERE ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS FROM ANY OTHER MEMBERS. NOW. SORRY WITH THAT. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE JUST. IDEA THAT AS I MENTIONED THAT I LIKE TO THINK IT AND AND THEIR ADVOCATES I THINK THAT THE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE'VE HAD WE'VE MADE THE BILL BETTER AND ADDRESSED FRANKLY WHAT I THOUGHT WAS THEIR LARGEST CONCERN. WHICH WAS RECIPROCITY. AND AGAIN THEM AS MY COLLEAGUES. ON ON THE COMMITTEE INCLUDING YOU MADAM CHAIR HAVE MENTIONED THIS IS A VERY NARROWLY SCOPED BILL THAT'S MEANT TO PROVIDE MORE EFFICIENCY TO GOVERNMENT SERVICES AND HOW WE DO BUSINESS. AYE NOTHING MORE NOTHING LESS. AND I'D RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. WITHOUT THE RECOMMENDATION IS IS TO PASS WITH AMENDED I WOULD HOPE THAT WHATEVER LAST THINGS THAT YOU'RE ABLE TO GET WORKED OUT WITH THE OPPOSITION YOU GET WORKED UP FOR THE FLOOR WITHOUT LISTS HIGHLAND WE CALL THE ROLL.

GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR A COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I'D LIKE TO ACCEPT THE PROPOSED COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS REGARDING A SUNSET OF FIVE YEARS FOR THE EXEMPTION AND THE TECHNICAL AMENDMENT ON PAGE FOUR OF THE ANALYSIS AS AN AUTHORS AMENDMENT. AS AMENDED AB THREE THOUSAND WOULD EXEMPT THE SALE OF HYDROGEN FUEL FOR ZERO MISSION FUEL CELL BLOCK LECTURE VEHICLES FROM THE STATE AND LOCAL SALES TAX. AND. AND USE TAX FOR FIVE YEARS. EARLIER THIS YEAR GOVERNOR BROWN ISSUED EXECUTIVE ORDER BE FORTY EIGHT FOURTEEN WHICH AMONG OTHER THINGS CALLED FOR A NEW AMBITIOUS TARGET OF FIVE MILLION ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES BY TWENTY THIRTY. FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLES LIKE THEIR PLUGIN BATTERY COUNTERPARTS ARE ZERO EMISSION BATTERY ELECTRIC VEHICLES BUT ARE POWERED BY HYDROGEN. CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF THE LARGEST HYDROGEN PRODUCING STATES WITH ITS HYDROGEN FUEL CELL SUBJECT TO THE SALES AND USE TAX. HOWEVER CALIFORNIA'S TAXATION ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE FUELS IS INCONSISTENT. SECTION THIRTY A SIXTY THREE FIFTY THREE OF THE REVENUE AND TAXATION CODE COMPLETELY EXEMPTS ELECTRICITY FROM THE STATE AND LOCAL SALES AND USE TAX. BY EXEMPTING HYDROGEN SOLD AS TRANSPORTATION FUEL FROM THE SALES AND USE TAX A. B. THREE THOUSAND WILL EQUALLY TREAT THE CONSUMERS OF TWO DIFFERENT ZEBRA TECHNOLOGIES. AB THREE THOUSAND WILL ENSURE PARITY BETWEEN TAXATION OF HYDROGEN HYDROGEN AND ELECTRICITY ONE SOLD AS TRANSPORTATION FUELS PER ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES. IN DOING SO CONSUMERS PURCHASING FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLES WILL BE TREATED EQUALLY. THE TEMPORARY REDUCTION IN THE COST OF HYDROGEN FUEL EASE THE TRANSITION FOR CONSUMERS INTO FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLES. WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF AB THREE THOUSAND IS DOCTOR SHANE STEPHENS FOUNDER FIRST ELEMENT FUEL AND JACK ONE BIRDS ALL A SENIOR ENGINEER WITH TOYOTA I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS DOCTOR SHANE STEPHENS A FOUNDER OF FIRST ELEMENT FUEL. OF FIRST LET ME SAY THAT. ME IN MY COMPANY WE WE REALLY SUPPORT THAT CALIFORNIA ZEV POLICY AND AND GOALS IN THE STATE MY COMPANY WOULD NOT EXIST WHERE MORE FOR WHO IF IT WEREN'T FOR THESE. THE POLICIES OF CALIFORNIA. A TO DATE WE'VE BUILT NINETEEN HYDROGEN STATIONS IN THE STATE WE HAVE TWELVE OR UNDER DEVELOPMENT WE'VE COMPLETED OVER A HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND SUCCESSFUL FILLS OF RETAIL FUEL CELL CARS IN THE HANDS. OF CUSTOMERS. AND WE ESTIMATE THAT WE'VE AVOIDED NEARLY TWENTY MILLION POUNDS OF CO TWO EMISSIONS AS A RESULT OF THOSE FILMS. TO PUT THAT INTO CONTEXT THAT'S THE EQUIVALENT OF PLANTING A FOREST SEVENTY FIVE TIMES THE SIZE OF DISNEYLAND. SO WE'RE PROUD OF OF. THE START THAT WE'VE GOT AND WE'RE OFF TO A GOOD START WITH ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND. FUEL CELL CARS ON THE ROAD IN CALIFORNIA. BUT WE NEED TO TRANSITION OUT EARLY COMMERCIAL SCALE AND WHILE WERE HAVING SOME EARLY SUCCESS THERE ARE MANY CHALLENGES THAT WE STILL FACE AND IT'S NOT A. A SILVER BULLET THAT'S GOING TO BE A SOLUTION IT'S REALLY THE COMPREHENSIVE SET OF POLICIES IN CALIFORNIA. WE BELIEVE THIS EXEMPTION WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH THE CALIFORNIA SUPPORT OF ZEV TECHNOLOGIES OTHER ARE TO USE OF TECHNOLOGIES PLUG IN VEHICLES AND HYDROGEN. THIS WOULD PUT THEM ON PARITY IN TERMS OF HOW THE CONSUMERS OF THOSE VEHICLES ARE TAXED. AND WOULD ALSO ADDRESS EIGHT NEAR TERM CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE OF A HIGHER PRICE OF HYDROGEN AT THE PUMP TODAY COMPARED TO GASOLINE IN CONVENTIONAL FUELS. SO WE WANT TO PASS A LOWER COST ON TO THE CONSUMER AT THE PUMP. BECAUSE ONE OF THE BIGGEST QUESTIONS THAT WE HEAR FROM OUR CUSTOMERS ARE WELL WHEN IS THE PRICE GOING TO COME DOWN WHAT HAPPENS WHEN MY LEASE RUNS OUT. I'M THINKING OF BUYING THIS VEHICLE RATHER THAN LEASING IT BUT AS THE PRICE OF HYDROGEN GONNA STAY HIGH. WE BELIEVE THIS WILL HELP STIMULATE. THE ZEV THIS HAVE CUSTOMER IN THE GROWTH OF SOBS. I'M FINE I JUST WANT TO CLOSE BY SAYING THAT AS WE ACHIEVE EARLY COMMERCIAL SCALE AND WE THINK WE'LL BE ABLE TO DO THAT IN THE TEN YEAR TIME FRAME. WE CERTAINLY WANT TO COME BACK AND THINK ABOUT HOW ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES THAT AND THE FUELING OF THEM SHOULD BE APPROPRIATELY TAX. AND. THAT'S WHY WE'VE. I RECOMMENDED SUNSET DATE I THINK YOU GUYS BROUGHT THAT DOWN WILL BE TO FIVE YEARS WERE SUPPORTIVE OF REVISITING THIS IN THE FUTURE. NOW TURNED OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE JACQUI FROM TOYOTA. GREAT THINGS HERE. AB MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS GOOD AFTERNOON. I'M MY NAME IS JACKIE BIRDS ON I AM A SENIOR ENGINEER WITH TOYOTA MOTOR NORTH AMERICA. AND WE'RE PLEASED TO BE HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BUDGETS LEGISLATION. AS YOU KNOW TO IT IS STRONGLY COMMITTED TO DOING OUR PART TO HELP ME CALIFORNIA'S AMBITIOUS AND IMPORTANT GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION AND CLIMATE CHANGE GOALS. IN ADDITION TO OFFERING PLUG IN HYBRIDS AND BATTERY BUDGET VEHICLES WE ARE ALSO PROUD TO HAVE BEEN FIRST TO THE MARKET WITH ARE FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLE THE MERE AYE. FC VIS OUR FRIEND EXCELLENT ALTERNATIVE TO GASOLINE POWERED CARS AND ARE MORE CLOSELY MATCHING THE U. S. MASS MARKET NEEDS FOR VEHICLES THAT CAN BE REFUELED QUICKLY. AND DRIVING LONG DISTANCES. FOR EXAMPLE THE MERE I CAN HAS A RANGE OF THREE OR TWELVE MILES AND CAN BE REFILLED IN A MATTER OF MINUTES. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL WILL HELP ACCELERATE SEVEN OPTION IN TWO WAYS. THE FIRST IS THAT IT WILL HELP TO REDUCE THE COST OF RETAIL HYDROGENS THE CONSUMER DURING THE EARLY MARKET INTRODUCTION YEARS. ONE RETAIL HYDROGEN COSTS ARE ON NATURALLY HIGHER THAN THEY WILL BE IN A FULLY DEVELOPED MARKET. REDUCING THE CONSUMERS COST OF OWNERSHIP WILL HELP TO ACCELERATE THIS ADOPTION. SECOND IT WILL CREATE PARITY BETWEEN TWO THAT TECHNOLOGIES IN THE MARKETPLACE TODAY. PLUGIN BATTERIES SECOND ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES AND HYDROGEN FUEL CELLS ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES. CURRENTLY THE LOCK COMPLETELY EXEMPTS ELECTRICITY FROM THE STATE AND LOCAL SALES AND USE TAX FOR PLUG IN BATTERY ELECTRICS. WHILE RETAIL HYDROGEN FUEL CELLS UNFAIRLY REMAIN SUBJECT TO THE SALES AND USE TAX. AB THREE THOUSAND WILL REMEDY THIS INCONSISTENT TREATMENT OF FUELS FOR THESE TWO ELECTRIC VEHICLE TECHNOLOGIES. IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE EMPLOY A WIDE RANGE OF NEAR TERM TOOLS TO ENCOURAGE AND ACCELERATE CONSUMER ADOPTION IF WE ARE TO ACHIEVE ARE IMPORTANT TRANSPORTATION SECTOR CLIMATE CHANGE SCHOOLS. INDEED THEY ARE RESOURCES BOARD HAS REPEATEDLY MADE CLEAR THAT WE CANNOT ME ARM ABILITY TRAMPS ARE MOBILE TRANSPORTATION EMISSION REDUCTION GOALS WITHOUT HYDROGEN FUEL CELL TECHNOLOGY. AS WELL AS OTHERS THAT TECHNOLOGIES. SO WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER. AB THREE THOUSAND WILL SIMPLY ENSURE PARITY BETWEEN THE TAXATION OF HYDROGEN AND ELECTRICITY ONE SOLD AS A TRANSPORTATION FUEL FOR ZAPS. AND IN DOING SO CONSUMER PURCHASING FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLES WILL BE TREATED EQUALLY. AND THE TEMPORARY REDUCTION IN THE COST OF HYDROGEN WILL ACCELERATE CONSUMER TRANSITION INTO OF CVS. WE THEREFORE WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND STRONGLY URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS JOHN WHITE WITH THE CALIFORNIA HYDROGEN BUSINESS COUNCIL WE SUPPORT THE BILL. OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS DIRECTLY JOHNSON THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES. EVEN OPPOSE MONTH AMENDED POSITION ASKING THAT THE GOALS OF THIS BILL ARE SHEEP THERE A STATE SHARE EXEMPTION ON THE LOCAL SHARE WHICH IS USED TO FUND. I'M CRITICAL NINE. BY NINETEEN NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN REALIGNMENT NOT TO MENTION LOCAL PROGRAMS OFFERED BY COUNTY SO FOR THOSE REASONS RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AMENDMENTS TO EXCLUDE THE LOCAL SHARE FROM THE EXEMPTION THANK YOU. SOME OF THE CROW THE CALL FOR A TAX REFORM ASSOCIATION WE HAVEN'T TAKEN A POSITION ON THIS BILL YET. A WOULD MENTION THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF BILLS LIKE THIS THAT HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED OVER TIME AND AND PERHAPS MAYBE. NOW CERTAINLY. I'VE I THINK MR PEROT HAD UMBILICAL YEARS BACK REVISING ONE THAT WAS. CREATED THE YEAR OF MY BIRTH SO WE HAVE A LOT OF THESE MEASURES BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE REALLY STARTED CONSIDERING. PUTTING SUNSET DATES AND SORT OF MANDATING SUNSET DATES ON THESE ITEMS AND SO THERE'S A SLEW OF ITEMS INTENDED TO INCENTIVIZE. VARIOUS FUELS AND TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE REALLY VERY OUTDATED AT THIS POINT AND YOU MIGHT CONSIDER LOOKING AT SOME OF THOSE AS A WAY TO OFFSET THE COSTS IN THIS MEASURE. THANK YOU. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE MISTER MELONES MCCURRY. WELL AND LOOK AT HIM. JUST THAT CPAS GENERAL QUESTION I SUPPORT THIS I THINK WE NEED MORE. WHEN WE DO THAT. MORE POLICIES IN CALIFORNIA TO FOCUS ON SAID VEHICLES IT'S ONLY ONE POINT FORWARD IT TO TWO MILLION AND I GUESS THERE'S THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND THEIR VEHICLES. PER THIS ANALYSIS OF HOW MANY FUEL. HYDROGEN FUEL. VEHICLES TO HAVE HERE COMPARED TO. LET'S SAY YOU KNOW NON HUGS INFILL. IT WAS NOT THE SOLE HYBRIDS BUT BY TAP PLUGINS. WE ARE RISE SOLD OVER THREE THOUSAND VEHICLES THE ONE AS TOYOTA WITH OTHER AUTOMAKERS UP OVER THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED. YEAH SUCH A DROP IN THE BUCKET COMPARED THE OVERALL AND DO YOU THINK BY HAVING EXEMPTION ON THAT SALES TAX THAT THIS WOULD MAKE IT AT A DIFFERENCE FOR CONSUMER BEHAVIOR. ARE THERE OTHER FACTORS THAT ARE THAT ARE WAY ABOVE THAT THE SALE OF FUEL. I THINK YES THAT THE YOU KNOW THE SALES TAX IS A SIGNIFICANT PORTION IT'S NEARLY TEN PERCENT OF YOU LOOK AT THE AVERAGE ACROSS ALL THE LOCATIONS THAT WERE IN AND. I THINK THAT. IF WE CAN EVEN SHELVE THE SIGNAL THAT THE PRICES STARTING TO COME DOWN THAT WILL MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE TO US TO CONSUMERS IN THIS NEAR TERM MARKET. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ESCORT. SO I'M HAVING A HARD TIME FIGURING THIS OUT. SO I ALMOST I ENDED UP GETTING THE HONDA CLARITY FUEL CELL. AND I USE THE TRIGGER ZERO STATION. ABA KIND OF BETA TESTERS HITS TECHNOLOGY WELL YOUR STATIONS ARE PRETTY GOOD. AND LINDY STATIONS ARE AWFUL ANYWAY. SORRY ABOUT THAT IF THERE'S A SOMEBODY FROM LINDA HERE BUT I CAN DOCUMENT IT. ANYWAY. SO WE'RE KIND OF BETA TESTERS. AND. I WOULD APPRECIATE SOMETHING THAT WOULD HELP US THE PROBLEM IS THIS REALLY DOESN'T EVERYONE WHO BUYS A CAR TODAY. THE FUEL IS PAID FOR BY THE MANUFACTURER WHETHER IT'S TOYOTA OR HONDA OR ANYONE ELSE. AND I WAS TOLD THAT. NOT TOO EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO BY THIS BECAUSE FRANKLY THE FUEL CELL TECHNOLOGY IS PROBABLY GONNA BE VERY DIFFERENT AT THE END OF MY THREE YEAR LEASE. AND TYPICALLY THESE HAVE THREE YEAR LEASES WERE TALKING ABOUT. A FIVE YEAR SUNSET AND NO ONE IS PAINFUL NO CONSUMER IS PAYING FOR HYDROGEN. SO IT WOULD CLEARLY HELP. EITHER THE MANUFACTURER WHO WOULD BE PAYING TEN PERCENT LAST. OR THE RETAILER I'M NOT QUITE SURE. WHETHER THE REACH WHETHER YOU IS A RETAILER WOULD BE DO SHARE PRICE TEN PERCENTER. AND GIVE IT ON TO THE MANUFACTURER WHETHER IT WOULD JUST HELP YOUR BUSINESS. AND I'M WILLING TO SAY YOU KNOW IF THE MANUFACTURER THANKS. THIS WOULD HELP THEM OR IF YOU THINK YOU REALLY NEED THAT BOOST YOUR PROFITS THAT'S FINE BUT I JUST DON'T SEE HOW IT HELPS CONSUMER. SO. LET ME WAY AND I'M SURE JACQUI WILL KNOW ONE AWAY AS WELL SO I THINK I'M. YOUR NUMBER ONE THERE'S THIS THE SIGNAL THAT THAT YOU SENT TO THE MARKET AND RIGHT NOW. AUTOMAKERS ARE PAYING FOR THE FUEL IS A NECESSARY EVIL THEY DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO DO THAT. THEY'RE DOING IT BECAUSE IT FEELS UNNATURALLY RAY HOW HIGH RIGHT NOW THE PRICES ARE NATURALLY HIGH RIGHT NOW IN THE EARLY MARKET. WE'RE IN ON THE NEAR TERM THAT'S GOOD FOR US BECAUSE IT TAKES SOME OF THE PRESSURE OFF OF MY COMPANY FOR LOWERING THE PRICE. BUT THAT'S NOT HEY CREATE A REAL MARKET RIGHT AND ITS CUSTOMERS KEEP GETTING USED TO THOUGH OEM'S THE AUTOMAKERS PAYING FOR THE FUEL. I MEAN THAT'S LIKE CRACK COCAINE YEAH THEY'RE GONNA WANT TO KEEP THAT. THAT HABIT GOING AND GOING AND THAT'S NOT A WAY TO CREATE A SUSTAINABLE LONG TERM MARKET. OF THAT COST TO THE AUTOMAKERS WILL BALLOON SO HIGH THAT. NOW THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN THAT. AND I THINK OUT NUMBER TWO THERE IS A QUESTION OF US CUSTOMERS GET INTO THIS IN THE LONG TERM THEY'RE CONSIDERING. DIE WANT TO BUY THIS CAR OR LEAD SAFE AND I THINK WITH THE HONDA LEASES THE ONLY OPTION THAT THEY'RE GIVING BUT THE MIRAI YOU CAN ACTUALLY BUY IT AS WELL. ARE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S DISSUADING CUSTOMERS FROM BUYING THE CAR BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN THE PRICE OF FUEL AND THEIR. THEIR FEELS ONLY GETTING PAID FOR FOR A THREE YEAR TIME PERIOD SO NINE SO WOULD GO DOWN FROM THE EQUIVALENT OF ABOUT EIGHT DOLLARS A GALLON TWO SEVEN TWENTY. THAT'S ABOUT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE IT SIXTEEN DOLLARS A KILOGRAM AND. ROUGHLY KILOGRAMS WORTH YOU GET ABOUT SIXTY MILES. AND WE DO PLAN TO PASS THAT COST ON TO THE CONSUMER WON'T. BE IMPACTS OUR PROFIT FOR COMPANY. SURE. YES OKAY. THANK YOU JUST QUIRK ADDITIONAL MEMBERS WISHING TO SPEAK. SEEING NONE. THERE WAS A MOTION WAS OUR SECOND. WAIT A SECOND. SECULARIST MCCARTY. ISRAEL JOINT CLOSE.

EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE WILL ALLOW CAMERAS BUSINESSES FILING AS A SOLE PROPRIETOR OR PARTNERSHIP OR LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY TO DEDUCT ORDINARY AND NECESSARY BUSINESS EXPENSES. FROM THEIR PERSONAL INTIMATE COME TAX INCOME STATE TAXES. THE ABILITY TO DEDUCT EXPENSES INCURRED WHILE CONDUCTING BUSINESS IS ENJOYED BY ALL LEGITIMATE BUSINESSES WHEN FILING TAXES HOWEVER THE IRS CODE SECTION TWO EIGHT ZERO. E. PROHIBITS NOT CORPORATE ENTITIES THAT DERIVE THEIR PROFITS FROM THE TRAFFICKING OF A CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE FROM DEDUCTING THESE EXPENSES AS A RESULT CAMERAS BUSINESSES THAT ARE NOT INCORPORATED. ARE TAXED AT HIGHER RATES THAN ANY OTHER LEGAL BUSINESS IN THE STATE. AB EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE WILL ALLOW THE CORPORATE AND THE PERSONAL TAX CODES ALLOW LEGAL CANADA'S BUSINESSES TO DEDUCT LEGITIMATE OPERATIONAL EXPENSES. WITH ME TODAY I HAVE EMMA SO SNUG WITH THE CALIFORNIA CANNABIS INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION. SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK A GUY VOTE. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS.

SINCE ASSOCIATION WAS FOUNDED ALMOST FIVE YEARS AGO WE WORK TIRELESSLY TO IDENTIFY SOLUTIONS THAT ALLOW OUR MEMBERS TO BE TREATED LIKE ANY OTHER LICENSE BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA. DOES I SEE CA FULLY SUPPORTS THE NEED TO REDUCE THE TAX BURDEN ON LICENSE CANNABIS BUSINESSES. AND STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT SUCH EFFORTS WILL REDUCE ILLICIT OPERATIONS AND ENCOURAGE MORE OPERATORS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE COMPLIANT MARKETPLACE. WHITE HEARING TO THE MEDICINAL ADULT USE CANNABIS REGULATION AND SAFETY ACT OR MARKERS THAT. I'M ENACTED LAST YEAR LICENSE CANNABIS BUSINESSES ARE CURRENTLY PAINT SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER TAXES AND FEES THAN THEIR UNLICENSED COMPETITORS. THE ABILITY FOR THESE BUSINESSES TO DEDUCT THEIR BUSINESS EXPENSES FROM THEIR GROSS INCOME AS PROVIDED IN THIS BILL WILL ENCOURAGE COMPLAINTS OF CALIFORNIA'S NEW CANNABIS LAWS. REDUCED RD SIGNIFICANT SIGNIFICANT TAX BURDEN ON LEGAL BUSINESSES AND PROMOTE REGULATION AND ACCOUNTABILITY. FOR THE REASONS PREVIOUSLY STATED WE'RE PLEASED TO SPONSOR AB EIGHTEEN FIFTY THREE AND ENCOURAGE YOUR SUPPORT. I KATHY VAN AUSTIN REPRESENTING CMG KHALIFA. AND I'D CERTAINLY ONE ECHO AND. OF HER EARLIER COMMENTS. ONE OF THE THE THINGS THAT YOU REALLY RELY ON IT'S A BUSINESS OWNER IS BEING ABLE TO DEDUCT YOUR EXPENSES WHETHER IT'S FOR CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE EMPLOYEES EMPLOYEE TAXES. AND YOUR LEAN OF WHAT THE WHAT HAVE YOU THERE ARE NUMBER OF EXPENSES THAT ARE. ANY BUSINESS CAN TAKE AND TO DOC'S. I NOT ONLY FROM THE FEDERAL BUT THEY'RE HAVING. AND IT IT COUNTS ORDER STATE TAXES I BELIEVE. THIS BILL REALLY RECOGNIZES THE DILEMMA THAT THIS. THOSE PARTS THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY AND KHALIFAH IS ONE OF LARGEST. ENTITIES IN THE STATE THE VERTICALLY INTEGRATED OUT OF SAN JOSE. AND THEIR EXPENSES AND AS YOU CAN IMAGINE ARE IN THE MILLIONS AT THE MULTI MILLIONS AND THEY CANNOT DEDUCT A SINGLE. PENNY.

MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS MAY THE CROW THE TALKS REFORM ASSOCIATION I'M A COUPLE PROBLEMS WITH THIS BILL AND YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN DECADES SINCE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DID OFFER A BENEFIT OF THIS NATURE TO VETERANS AND EVEN THEN. WE'RE TALK ABOUT SOMETHING THAT WAS REALLY LIMITED TO A SPECIFIC. I AM. TO A SPECIFIC INCOME LEVEL HERE YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE ACTUALLY TALKING PER THE AUTHORS ON COMMENTARY ABOUT PEOPLE WERE VERY HIGHLY SKILLED WHO ARE WHO ARE VERY LIKELY TO BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY MAKE. UPWARDS OF A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR AND WE WILL STILL THEN BE PROVIDING A TAX CREDIT UNDER THIS BILL. TO THE TUNE OF TWO HUNDRED OVER TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS. AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT ULTIMATELY IS GOING TO TAKE AWAY FUNDING FROM THE GENERAL FUND FOR OTHER OF OUR PUBLIC SERVANTS POLICE FIRE AT CETERA OUGHT TO A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT DEGREE AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE OPPOSE THE MEASURE THINKING. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE TALKED QUIRK. YEAH I JUST THINK THIS MONEY WOULD BE BETTER SPENT ON SOMETHING LIKE HOMELESSNESS FOR VETERANS WHICH IS A REALLY BIG PROBLEM RIGHT NOW. WELL WE PASSED THE BOND IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN HOW TO DRESS HOMELESS VETERANS IN THE COUNTIES ARE MY OWN COUNTY OF ORANGES SAID NOT TO AND FOURTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IN PROP SIXTY THREE MONEY. SO THERE'S MONIES AVAILABLE IT'S MORE OF A MANAGEMENT PROBLEM. BUT. RESPONDING TO THE OPPOSITION. THERE'S NO MONEY TO COLLECT IF THE RETIREE DOESN'T LIVE IN THE STATE. SO WE NEED INCENTIVES TO KEEP THESE PEOPLE HERE. YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN COME FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY SERVE ON SHIPS IN SAN DIEGO. MARINE SERVE ON CAMPAIGN TOTAL PANEL TEN ON THE SOUTHERN PART OF MY DISTRICT LOT OF ON RETIRING SAN CLEMENTE. FOR AWARD. DE INTELLIGENCE. AGENCIES UP IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND IF WE WANT THESE PRODUCTIVE CITIZENS TO STAY IN THE STATE WE NEED OFFER SOME. SOME TAX CREDITS OR SOME INCENTIVE FOR THOSE IN AND ITS STATE IT'S NOT JUST VETERANS AND STATE RETIREES AS WELL. I MAKE A COMMENT. A IF YOU'RE NOT AWARE. VETERANS AND FEDERAL BENEFITS BROUGHT IN OVER FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN NEW FEDERAL BENEFITS. WHICH MOST OF WILL CONTINUE TO COME AND AS LONG AS I LIVE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND THAT'S A GREAT POINT AS WELL THE WAY THE VA MODEL IS BASED. IT'S BASED ON POPULATION SO OF CALIFORNIA HAS MORE VETERANS THE VA'S FORCED TO BUILD MORE CLINICS IN MORE HOSPITALS AND PUT MORE RESOURCES IN THE STATE IF WE HAVE LESS VETERANS.

OKAY AFTERNOON I'M HEIDI MCAULIFFE WITH AMERICAN COATINGS ASSOCIATION. I'D LIKE TO TALK TO A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE COATINGS ASSOCIATION THE COATINGS INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE OVER TWO HUNDRED MANUFACTURERS ITSELF PRODUCT HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE EMPLOY OVER THIRTY SIX THOUSAND CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS. OUR INDUSTRY PAYS ABOUT AN AVERAGE OF FORTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS TO OUR WORKERS. AND WE SUPPORT A PAYROLL OVER ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO CALIFORNIA'S ONE OF OUR. WE LIKE TO CALL ONE OF OUR TOP TEN STATES WE HAVE A VERY LARGE FOOTPRINT OF MANUFACTURERS. HERE IN CALIFORNIA. IN OUR MEMBERS. INCLUDE A LOT OF COMPANIES THAT MAKE. A VERY WIDE VARIETY OF CATEGORIES OF PRODUCTS OF THE PAIN INDUSTRIES CONSISTS OF MANY MANY DIFFERENT CATEGORIES. MANY OF WHICH ARE SOLD AT RETAIL A LOT OF VERY SPECIALTY NICHE PRODUCTS SOLD AT RETAIL LIKE AEROSOL PAINTS AUTOMOTIVE AND MARINE PAINTS. TRAFFIC AND ROAD MARKING PAINTS INDUSTRIAL MAINTENANCE COATINGS. AND RECYCLED CONTENT COATINGS JUST TO NAME A FEW. I I BELIEVE THAT YOU ALL SHOULD HAVE A LIST OF. OVER TWO HUNDRED MANUFACTURERS THAT ACTUALLY SELL PAINT AT RETAIL. IN CALIFORNIA AND I JUST LIKE THE. GO OVER A COUPLE OF THESE. NAMES OF THESE PRODUCTS. ACRYLIC TEX COATINGS AND RECYCLING INCORPORATED AMAZON ENVIRONMENTAL FAIR PROCESS CORPORATION. CAMEO SPECIALTY PRODUCTS. CHALK COUNTRY PAIN CUSTOM PAINT PRODUCT GROUP. DON EDWARDS CORPORATION ECO STEPS COATINGS. ENVIRO CARE CORPORATION FRANKLIN PAINT COMPANY. KELLY MOORE COMPANY. MAD DOG PAINT PRODUCTS OLIVETTI ORGANIC FINISHES. SEE MORE OF SYCAMORE. SUNNY SIDE CORPORATION TEXTURED COATINGS OF AMERICA. ENVISIONS PAINT RECYCLING LET'S JUST A COUPLE OF THE NAMES I PICKED OUT REALLY SOME NAMES ON THIS LIST OF COMPANIES THAT. MANUFACTURE SORT OF NICHE SPECIALTY TYPE. PRODUCTS. PRODUCTS THAT NEVER CONTRIBUTED TO. OF THE LEAD THE PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE WITH REGARD TO HIGH BLOOD LEAD LEVELS. PRODUCT COMPANIES THAT MAY NEVER HAVE BEEN IN EXISTENCE WHEN LEAD WAS THE STATE OF THE ART TECHNOLOGY AND REQUIRED BY MANY GOVERNMENT'S. COMPANIES THAT. THAT NEVER ENGAGED IN THAT SAW. IN THAT PRODUCT CATEGORY. LIKE I SAID A LOT OF THESE ARE NIECE PRODUCTS. AND I DO KNOW THAT ALL OF THESE AS I SAID SELL PRODUCTS AT RETAIL AND WOULD BE SUBJECT TO THE TAX. THAT WOULD BE IMPOSED UNDER THIS BILL. THIS LIST ACTUALLY IS IS PUBLICLY AVAILABLE TO YOU IT'S LISTED ON THE WEBSITE FOR PAIN CARE. AND ALL OF THESE MANUFACTURERS ARE REGISTERED AS SELLING PRODUCTS AT RETAIL. SO AGAIN A LIKE I SAID A LOT OF THESE ARE SMALL MEDIUM SIZE COMPANIES NIECE PRODUCTS AND ADDED TAX ON TOP OF THESE PRODUCTS WOULD. WOULD PROVE. VERY MUCH A DIFFICULTY OF FOR THESE COMPANIES IN ESTABLISHING THEIR NATION CALIFORNIA. TEN SECONDS. THANK YOU. I JUST LIKE TO URGE YOU TO VOTE AGAINST THIS BILL IT'S UNFAIR TO THE REST OF THE PAIN COATINGS INDUSTRY. IT HOLDS TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE COMPANIES RESPONSIBLE FOR THE HISTORIC MANUFACTURE AND SALE OF LEAD BASED PRODUCTS WHEN THEY'D NEVER ENGAGE IN THAT ACTIVITY. IT HOLDS COMPANIES RESPONSIBLE ONE MANY WERE NOT IN EXISTENCE. WHEN THIS WAS THE STATE OF THE ART TECHNOLOGY. IT HOLDS COMPANIES RESPONSIBLE FOR THE BALLOT INITIATIVE WHEN THEY ARE NOT INVOLVED IN THAT LITIGATION. OR IN THE PROMOTION OF THE BALLOT INITIATIVE SO I URGE YOU TO VOTE AGAINST THIS BILL. OTHER I DO THINK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. XENA QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SO REMEMBER MELINDA'S. THANK MADAM CHAIR. SO I. HEARD THIS BILL IN ONE OF MY OTHER COMMITTEES. AND UNFORTUNATELY WAS NOT ABLE TO VOTE FOR IT THEN NOR CAN I VOTE FOR IT TODAY I THINK. MISTER QUIRK KNOWS WHY NAM I I JUST FEEL. TWICE I SYMPATHIZE WITH. YOUR POINT ABOUT THE LEAD PAINT. BUT I STILL THINK THAT IT WILL DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECT THE LOWER INCOME FOLKS BECAUSE THE TAX WILL BE PASSED ON TO THEM. SO. PEOPLE HAVE A FEW EXTRA BUCKS IN A POCKET IT WON'T MATTER TO THEM IT'S THERE'S A MEMBER ON THE LOWER END OF THE SCALE I WILL SAY THAT. JUST. TO BE FAIR. THE LIST THAT WE WERE GIVEN HERE OF I KNOW HOW MANY OVER. TWO HUNDRED DIFFERENT PAINT COMPANIES ARE OPPOSED TO THIS BILL. WE WOULD EXPECT PAINT COMPANIES TO BE AGAINST THIS BILL SO I DON'T KNOW THAT THIS MOVES THE NEEDLE FOR OUR FOR ANYONE WHO MIGHT BE ON THE FENCE ABOUT THIS BILL BECAUSE. THIS AFFECTS ALL OF THEM SO NATURALLY THEY WOULD BE AGAINST SOMETHING THAT INCREASE THEIR COSTS JUST FOR YOUR OWN. AYE NOTES AYE QUESTION IT'S OKAY I JUST ONE YEAR AND NOW I JUST CLARIFY THAT NO I DON'T NEED CLARIFICATION I JUST BUT THAT'S NOT A LIST OF COMPANIES THAT ARE OPPOSED TO IT. THAT'S JUST A LIST OF COMPANIES THAT SELL PAINT INTO CALIFORNIA OKAY FAIR ENOUGH WELL IT IT'S PRESENTED AS THOUGH THESE ARE THIS IS A LIST OF OPPOSITION IS WELL I JUST WANTED YOU. TO BE. AND WE UNDERSTOOD WHAT I'M SAYING GREAT OF COURSE WE WOULD OUR ACT. SO BUT AGAIN I THINK IT GOES BACK TO THE COST BE IS ALWAYS PASSED ON TO THE CONSUMER. WE KNOW THAT TO BE TRUE AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS I'M I'M NOT ABLE TO SUPPORT IT. MISTER CURRY THANK YOU OUT FIRST I'D LIKE TO MOVE THE BILL. THE GIFT. AND THEN POSSIBLY WANT TO ADDRESS A FEW THINGS THAT. THAT THERE IS A COST THERE'S NO FREE LUNCH ON THIS ISSUE AND SO WHETHER IT'S. HOW PASSED ON THE CONSUMER PASSED ON OF THE TAXPAYER IS THE QUESTION I THINK THAT THE AUTHOR IS IS BRINGING UP THIS ISSUE BECAUSE IF IT IS THAT? A BOND THAT GOES BEFORE THE VOTERS SIMPLE MATHEMATICS SHOWS THAT THAT MONEY HAS TO COME FROM SOMEWHERE. THE FIFTY M.. IF THE AB BOND PASSES AND THAT COMES OUT OF EXPENDITURES THAT WE MAKE IN MY BUDGET COMMITTEE AND ALL ACROSS THE STATE AND. AND I THINK THAT YOU KNOW WE ALREADY HAVE. PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA. PAINT MATCHES BATTERIES ALREADY. BUT THIS IS ISN'T IT AN ADDITIONAL COST AND THEM I JUST WONDER MISTER. MISTER QUIRK IF YOU COULD EXPLAIN ONE MORE THE SKY LIKE A TRIPLE FLIP TYPE THING IS THE. ONLY. GOES INTO A FACT RIGHT IF THE MEASURE. PASSES. THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S CORRECT AND YOU NAY EVEN BETTER IF THE MEASURE WITH WITH TROTTER THEM I COULD WITHDRAW MY DENTAL. BUT IF IT IF THE MEASURE. PASSES AND YOUR BILL. FAILS. THEY'RE STILL MOST LIKELY WOULD BE. A ON. I'M PSYCHED IF IF THE. THE MEASURE FAILS AND THEY WIN THEIR COURT DECISION. YOU MEAN THE COUNTIES. YES SO THEN THE LEAD PAINT COMPANIES WHO WHERE. SELLING LEAD PAINT COULD PAY THE PRICE. AND IT'LL HOW THAT IT'S FAST ON. WELL WHO KNOWS. I AGAIN I'M NOT GOING TO SPECULATE. I DO KNOW THAT IF. THE BOND PASSES. THAT. THE COSTS WILL BE PAID BY THE POOREST PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE MONEY WILL COME OUT OF. YEAH THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SEEING NONE ARE PERCOLATE CLOSE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. AGAIN PLEASE PROTECT THE POOR IN CALIFORNIA AND ALLOW THIS BILL TO GO ONTO THE NEXT STAGE THANK YOU.
