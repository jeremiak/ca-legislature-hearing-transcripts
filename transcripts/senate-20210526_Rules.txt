LEADING AGENCY PASS WITH PROTECT THE- HEALTH KNOWING OF HEALTH. AT THE STATE WE HAVE MADE GREAT. IN TYLER A FOURTH IN TYPE IN OUR COUNTY HEAVY IN RECESSED BECAUSE THAT'S MY. CLIMATE IMPACTS LIKE WILDFIRE AND EXTREME HEAT I NEED TO DO ALL OF THIS WITH THE GOAL OF PROTECTING THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND COMMUNITIES MOST IMPACTED. HARBISON LARGE AND COMPLEX AGENCY HEADED BY A BOARD THAT BY DESIGN HAD THE IN VARIED EXPERIENCE. THAT EXPERIENCE IS CRITICAL TO OUR LEADERSHIP AT THE AGENCY AND I AM HONORED TO WORK WITH MY COLLEAGUES AS WE COLLECTIVELY MAKE REALLY DIFFICULT DECISION. OUR WORK CATCHES ALL AREAS OF OUR ECONOMY. WE HAVE COMMUNITY RESIDENTS NON GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS FEDERAL STATE LOCAL AND TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS INDUSTRY UNIONS SCIENTISTS AND MANY MANY OTHERS IT CARE DEEPLY ABOUT AND ARE IMPACTED BY WHAT WE DO. IN MY CAREER I HAVE ALWAYS TRIED TO LISTEN AND CONSIDER A VARIETY OF VIEWPOINTS AND BE OPEN TO FINDING PRACTICAL AND ACTIONABLE SOLUTIONS. TO MY MIND THIS ROLE IS ONE WHERE THOSE VALUES MUST BE FOUNDATIONAL. AS BOARD CHAIR I MUST BE ADAPTIVE COLLABORATIVE AND RECEPTIVE AS WE NAVIGATE THE RIGHT PATHWAYS TO ACHIEVE OUR MANDATE OF PROTECTING PUBLIC HEALTH AND TACKLING CLIMATE CHANGE. IN MY MIND IN THIS ROLE I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW MUCH I HAVE LEARNED FROM MY FELLOW BOARD MEMBERS. TRYING TO OUR UNION CONVERSATIONS WITH THOSE WHO INTERACT WITH CARP AND FROM OUR STAFF. I PLEDGE TO ALWAYS STAY IN LISTENING AND LEARNING MODE AS WE WORK TO FIND THE RIGHT SOLUTIONS. I AM EAGER TO WORK WITH YOU AS WE TACKLE THESE DAUNTING CHALLENGES ON BEHALF OF THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO ANSWERING YOUR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- SENATOR LAYERED WOULD YOU LIKE TO START THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM PRESIDENT AND LET ME JUST SAY QUICKLY IN THE INTEREST OF FULL DISCLOSURE. OF THAT THE CANDIDATE TO WAS GENERAL COUNSEL AT THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY FOR FOUR YEARS WHEN I WAS THE SECRETARY AND I WORKED HARD TO HIRE HER AND I WORKED HARD TO NOT HAVE HER LEAVE WHICH I THINK IS THE RECOMMENDATION AND HIS SECRETARY. EVERYONE HAD AN ASSIGNMENT WHETHER YOUR DEPUTY SECRETARY FOR LEGISLATION OR EXTERNAL AFFAIRS OR FOR GENERAL COUNSEL AND IT WAS MY GOAL AS A MANAGER TO MAKE SURE EVERYBODY HAD A MAJOR PROJECT IT MIGHT NOT BE DIRECTLY WITHIN THEIR ASSIGNMENT AND SO MS RANDOLPH WAS ASSIGNED TO THE WHOLE ISSUE. OF THE KLAMATH BASIN IN THE KLAMATH DAM REMOVAL AND WORKING WITH FORK AND WORKING WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS AND WORKING WITH- OF THE STATE OF OREGON AND THE DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR AND ACQUITTED HERSELF. VERY WELL AND THERE WAS A REASON THAT SHE WAS TAKEN BEFORE MY TIME TO BE PUT ON THE PC AND I JUST FELT LIKE IT WAS IMPORTANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. ARE AT THE BEGINNING BECAUSE BASED ON THE FOUR YEARS I WORKED WITH HER. BEFORE WE DO EVERYTHING IN THIS HEARING I COULD NOT RECOMMEND HER HIGHLY ENOUGH. BUT I THINK THAT THAT I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS AND THEN ONE IS THAT. THE ORDER THERE WAS ONE OTHER STATEMENT I WANTED TO MAKE FOR THE BENEFIT OF MY COLLEAGUES AND THERE IS OCCASION BEEN CRITICISM OF THE AIR BOARD FOR THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE ALL THESE POWERS AND IT'S LIKE THEY'RE UNELECTED BUREAUCRATS. I WAS IN THE LEGISLATURE WHEN THEY WERE GIVEN THOSE FILES SO THEY HAVE THOSE POWERS BECAUSE A DIRECTLY ELECTED LEGISLATORS AND GOVERNORS DID IT WITH AB THIRTY TWO AND SAID WE SHOULD. CHARGE ONE AGENCY WITH CLIMATE BUT THE ONE THING IS AN ALL ASK IT IN A LITTLE BIT TO IS IT IS THE CHARGE OF AIR QUALITY BEING IGNORED IN THE FACE OF ALL THE WORK THAT'S BEING DONE ON CLIMATE ALL ASKED THAT IN A MINUTE BUT- I WANT TO START WITH THE FACT THAT. R. WHAT IS CENTRAL. TO THEIR BOARDS WORK ON CLIMATE ISSUES IS THE SCOPING PLAN. AND IT PERIODICALLY AS DONNA REED ON AND NOW. OKAY HANG ON SENATOR. LET ME JUST SEE WHERE OKAY OKAY OKAY GREAT AND SO NOW YOU'RE ABOUT TO EMBARK ON THE SCOPING PLAN PROCESS AND IT WILL REALLY. ASK ALL THE QUESTIONS OF HOW TO UPDATE OUR OF THE ROLE OF THE- BOARDED THIS TO DIFFERENT ISSUES TAKE INTO ACCOUNT SOME OF THE CHANGES OF CONCERN WITH ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE HOW ARE YOU GOING TO APPROACH TO SCOPING PLAN BOTH IS IN WHAT YOU THINK NEEDS TO BE CONSIDERED AND HOW IT'S GOING TO INCLUDE PEOPLE AND STAKEHOLDERS FROM ACROSS THE SPECTRUM. THANK YOU SENATOR FOR THAT QUESTION I AM. AT IS GOING TO BE PLAYED A HUGE UNDERTAKING- IT'S THAT IT REALLY ALLOWS US TO LOOK AT WHAT IS OUR HALF TO TWENTY THIRTY HOW ARE WE- ACHIEVING OUR TWENTY THIRTY GOALS A 40% REDUCTION IN GHG EMISSIONS BY NINETEEN NINETY UP FROM NINETEEN NINETY. BUT THEN ALSO LOOKING AT- AT OUR PAST TO CARBON NEUTRALITY BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE. AND IN UNDERTAKING THE SCOPING PLAN THIS TIME AROUND. WE HAVE A LOT OF. TOOLS IN THE TOOLBOX THAT WE NEED TO BE ANALYZING DETERMINE WHAT STRATEGIES TO DEPLOY A TO GET TO CARBON NEUTRALITY AND TO MEET OUR TWENTY THIRTY CALL. SO WE HAVE AND SB ONE HUNDRED AND THE MANDATE TO HAVE 1100% THAT RETAIL SALES OF ELECTRICITY. WE HAVE THE- KEVIN- HEARING HIS VEHICLE EXECUTIVE ORDER WHICH- DIRECTS US TO. MOVE TOWARDS HEARING MISSION VEHICLE IN THE LATE EIGHTIES FACED BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE AND THE HEAVY DUTY SPACE BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE. AND IS REALLY MEANT TO TACKLE THE CRITICAL ISSUE OF TRANSPORTATION WHICH HAS SIGNIFICANT AIR QUALITY AND CLIMATE IMPACTS- IT ALLOWS US TO LOOK AT HOW EXISTING PROGRAMS ARE PERFORMING LIKE CAP AND TRADE AND THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD. IT ALLOWS US TO LOOK AT NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS AND TO SEE HOW THOSE IT INTO OUR CREDIT STRATEGY. SO IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS AND INPUT IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL. IT WILL TAKE A LONG TIME IT'LL TAKE A GOOD AND TWELVE TO EIGHTEEN MONTHS TO REALLY DO THE WORK WE NEED TO DO WE JUST FARMS THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ADVISORY COMMITTEE SO WE WILL BEGIN MEETING. WITH THEM TO GET THEIR INPUT YOUR P. BEGINNING INITIAL WORKSHOPS- WITH A COMMUNITY AND OTHER STATE AGENCIES. AND WE WILL BE CHARTING A PATH FORWARD TO GAIN PUBLIC INPUT AND- INTERACTION- IN DEVELOPING THE PLAN THERE'S A LOT OF- ANALYSIS THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN- MODELING AND SCIENTIFIC ANALYSIS. AND WE% ARE VERY EAGER AND OPEN TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH- COMMUNITIES AND STAKEHOLDERS ABOUT THEIR VIEWS AND THEIR ANALYSIS THAT THEY'RE SEEING- AND THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT THE BEST STRATEGY TO DEPLOY. SO I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO DOING THIS WORK AS AS AS YOU MENTIONED WITH THE KLAMATH EXAMPLE- THIRD OF. GATHERING TOGETHER A LOT OF PEOPLE AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO SOLVE PROBLEMS IT'S SOMETHING I ENJOY DOING AND I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO DISCUSS THE PLAN PROCESS. GRADE TEN AND I KNOW THAT. THAT SB SIX SEVENTEEN WAS ALSO ENACTED- BY FIGURES IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN OR IN THAT PERIOD AND IT REALLY ARE DIRECTED TO LOOK AT COULD ADD COMMUNITIES OR OR MORE INDIVIDUAL LOOKS HOW WHEN YOU'RE DOING THIS FROM THE STATEWIDE LEVEL WE DON'T COOPERATE THAT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT THEY'RE MORE COMMUNITY BASED- OF. ANALYSIS- LOOKS- EIGHTY SIX SEVENTEEN PROCESS- AND THE COMMUNITY AIR PROTECTION- TEAM WITHIN OUR AGENCY HAS BEEN WORKING WITH COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE BOTH INFORMALLY ADOPTED EIGHTY SIX SEVENTEEN. COMMUNITIES BUT THEN ALSO IN COMMUNITIES THAT ARE LOOKING AT. POSING COULD BECOME SIX SEVENTY COMMUNITIES OR COMMUNITIES THAT WE HAVE BEENWORKING WITH THROUGH OUR AND COMMUNITY AIRCRAFT PROGRAM AND OTHER MONITORING WORK. AND SO HE THE WORK IN THOSE SIX SEVENTEEN COMMUNITIES TO DEVELOP LOCAL AIR QUALITY MONITORING PLANNED OR COMMUNITY EMISSION REDUCTION PLAN AT THE KEY AS THE CASE MAY BE AT WITH REGARD TO DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES. THAT'S GIVEN US AN OPPORTUNITY TO- LEARN IT TOO AND WORKING THOSE COMMUNITIES- DEVELOP A COLLABORATIVE PROCESS WORK WITH THEIR DISTRICTS COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS LOCAL INDUSTRIES- AND TRY TO DEVELOP STRATEGIES AROUND EMISSIONS REDUCTION. AND SO WHAT THAT ENABLES US TO DO IS- REACH OUT TO THOSE COMMUNITIES AND- BUILD ON THOSE EXISTING RELATIONSHIPS- TO WORK ON THE SCOPING PLAN AND TO- AND TO HAVE ROBUST COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT WITH REGARD TO TACKLING SOME OF THE ISSUES AND THE SCOPING PLAN- SO WE HOPE TO BUILD ON THOSE. EXISTING RELATIONSHIPS THAT HAVE DEVELOPED OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS- AND REALLY GAIN SOME ROBUST INPUT INTO THE PLANNING PROCESS AND WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE ROLE OF. OF NOW THAT THERE'S MORE OF A COMMUNITY BASED LOOK AS PART OF THE OVERALL PROCESS- WITH REGARD TO INCORPORATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ADVOCATES SO- OBVIOUSLY SOME DO NOT FEEL HEARD IT IN VARIOUS CAR PROCESSES WILL THIS ENHANCE THEIR ABILITY TO. TO HAVE FEEDBACK WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING. AT THE MORE COMMUNITY LEVEL. I HARD BEEN. GROWING OVER THE YEARS INTO AS ITS ABILITY TO WORK WITH ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES BUT WE STILL ABSOLUTELY HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO- CHAU D. JACK YOUR MAMA JUSTICE ADVISORY COMMITTEE- IS AT THE KEY PART OF THAT DISCUSSION THAT PROCESS OF MAKING SURE THAT- WE ARE GIVING THEM THE RESOURCES THEY NEED. TO ASSIST IN THIS- WE'RE LOOKING AT OPTIONS AROUND COMPETITION AND OTHER WAYS TO MAKE SURE THAT- THEY'RE ABLE TO FULLY- ADVISE US AND IN TERMS OF THIS IS A VERY TIME CONSUMING PROCESS- AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT- THAT THEY THEY ALL HAVE A LOT OF OTHER WORK TO DO AND THIS IS GOING TO BE- AT AT- A LOT OF WORK FOR THEM AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE RECOGNIZE THAT AND THAT WE AND- AND THAT WE FOSTER AS MUCH PARTICIPATION AND INTERACTION AS POSSIBLE. SO I AM OPTIMISTIC THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO- FAILED AT A GOOD PROCESS THIS TIME AND I'M HOPING THAT- AT THE END OF THE DAY EVEN IF WE DON'T AGREE ON EVERYTHING THAT THEY DO FEEL HEARD AND FEEL THAT THEY HAVE FULLY- PARTICIPATED IN THE PROCESS- AND SO THAT'LL BE MICHAEL AND FOR THE SKIPPING PLAN I SUSPECT OTHERS MAY WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT BUT I'M HAPPY TO HAVE INTRODUCED IT THAT WAY OF TWO MORE QUESTIONS AND ONE IS. ARM IN IN MEETINGS YESTERDAY THANK YOU FOR MEETING AND YOUR COLLEAGUES THAT. WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM AND A BIT. ARE THE K. AND TRADE PROGRAM CAME UP AND IT WAS MENTIONED AT WASH. THE STATE OF WASHINGTON DECIDED TO CREATE ITS OWN CAP AND TRADE. AND IN DOING THAT THEY FELT LIKE THEY MADE CHANGES TO WHAT CALIFORNIA DOES BASED ON LEARNING FROM THE CALIFORNIA. EXPERIENCE THEN. THERE HAVE BEEN TWO INTERESTINGLY THERE'S TWO DIFFERENT WAYS OF LOOKING AT THAT BECAUSE SOME. CRITICS SAY. OF THE AIRBOARD WAS INFLEXIBLE ABOUT MAKING THOSE CHANGES HERE IN WASHINGTON POINTED THEM OUT AND THEN CONVERSELY. THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COIN IS THAT- CALIFORNIA LEARNED AND WAS ABLE TO ADVISE WASHINGTON AND HOW TO INCORPORATE THOSE CHANGES AND IMPROVE THE CALIFORNIA SYSTEM HOW WOULD YOU. SORT OF SPEAK TO THAT COMPARISON BETWEEN WASHINGTON AND CALIFORNIA. I GUESS WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT- THE TAPESTRY PROGRAM IN CALIFORNIA HAS EVOLVED OVER TIME AND THE- AND THE- THAT SORT OF STRATEGIES WE HAVE DEPLOYED IN THE PROCESS NEEDS TO BE- UNDER GOD HAVE. EVOLVED OVER TIME- AND I THINK THAT'S APPROPRIATE- I THINK THERE WAS- THERE HAVE BEEN CHANGES TO- HOW TO HANDLE AND- SO FOR EXCESS ALLOWANCES THERE DID HE DIDN'T AND HOW TO HANDLE VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THE PROGRAM AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP- KEEP INVOLVING- I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WASHINGTON LEARNED PLACE TO CONSIDER- OPPORTUNITIES TO ADDRESS ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE CAN TURN INTO THE BILL CAN A COMMUNITY AIR PROTECTION ASPECT. INTO THEIR PROGRAM FROM THE- BUT IT IT'S- AND IT'S- PROPOSED AND I THINK THAT THAT IS. A TESTER TO- CALIFORNIA GROWING AND LEARNING AND BEING ABLE TO- SHARE AN IMPORTANT LESSONS LEARNED WITH OTHER STATE GOOD I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT I'M HOPING THAT. THAT WE CONTINUED TO ADAPT AND TAKE THOSE CHANGES INTO ACCOUNT LASTLY THE QUESTION THAT I SORT OF TEED UP AT THE BEGINNING. OR DO YOU THINK WITH ALL THE EMPHASIS ON CLIMATE THE DEER BORDERS PAYING ENOUGH ATTENTION TO AIR QUALITY ISSUES WHICH WERE ESSENTIALLY ITS ORIGINAL CHARGE WHEN IT GOT OFF THE GROUND. YES I DO I THINK THAT YOU KNOW HIGHER HAS WORKED HARD TO ADDRESS- AIR QUALITY ATTACKS OVER THE YEARS- AND HAS HAS ALWAYS DONE SO IF YOU CAN YOU TO DO SO AS I MENTIONED IN MY OPENING COMMENT- ARE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CLEAN AIR ACT AND OUR OWN CALIFORNIA STANDARDS. HAVE HAD GOOD RESULTS AND HAVE BEEN VERY EFFECTIVE- AND WE CONTINUE TO ADDRESS IMPACTS FROM OUR GROUND BREAKING LOW NOT CONDITIONS REQUIREMENTS THE OMNIBUS HEAVY DUTY TRUCK RULE- FROM OUR- INSPECTION AND ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES INCLUDING INSPECTION AND NAY NATURAL. THAT IS CURRENTLY UNDER WAY- TO OUR EXTENSIVE WORK WITH THE LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS IN DEVELOPING STATE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN- AND THE STRATEGIES NEEDED TO REACH- CLEAN AIR ACT THE PAYMENT. TO OUR WORK IN THE LIGHT DUTY SPACE- GETTING- RIGHT NOW WE'RE WE'RE WORKING ON A NEW VEHICLE STANDARDS- AND ARE EXCITED THAT THE BY NET MINISTRATION IS POISED TO RETURN OUR CLEAN AIR ACT WAIVER SO THAT WE CAN. CONTINUE. TO LEAD IN THAT AREA- AND I FORGET TO MENTION AREN'T FOR WORK. WE HAVE. AN IMPRESSIVE NEW LAB OPENING IN RIVERSIDE THAT IS GOING TO HOW ARE- CONTINUED- ANALYSIS AND CERTIFICATION WORK IN OUR TESTING THAT WE DO TO IDENTIFY VEHICLES THAT ARE IN VIOLATION OF OUR STANDARDS- YOU KNOW THE VOLKSWAGEN SETTLEMENT WHEN IS THAT- HIGHEST. PROFILE ONE OF THOSE BUT WE HAVE MANY CASES WHERE OUR INTEREST NETWORK HAVE CAUGHT THE LEADERS RED HANDED- AND- AND WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE- SETTLEMENT FOR THAT BENEFIT THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND YOU KNOW I REALIZE OUR CLIMATE WORK- IS. A CALL AND I GET A LOT OF ATTENTION RATE- BECAUSE SOME OF THAT HAPPENED BY AND ON THE INTERNATIONAL STAGE AND THOSE MEETINGS WITH WORLD LEADERS- YOU KNOW MAKE CALIFORNIA PROUD CALIFORNIANS PROUD THAT THEIR- STATE IS LEADING A LOT OF AGE- SO I CAN UNDERSTAND HOW. SOME FOLKS MIGHT FEEL THAT THAT OVERSHADOWS. DAY WORK ON THINGS LIKE REDUCING EMISSIONS ON OCEAN GOING VESSELS AND- AND REGULATING FERRIES- REGULATORY pACTIONS RELATED TO OFF ROAD EQUIPMENT- SO I FEEL LIKE IT'S MY JOB AS CHAIR TO MAKE SURE THAT. I TELL THAT AIR QUALITY WORK AS MUCH AS I CAN- AND TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT FOLKS KNOW WE ARE WE REALLY ARE ON A DAY TO DAY. YEAH WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO CLEAN UP OUR AIR. AND ADOPT THE RIGHT STANDARDS- DAY IN AND DAY OUT AND ENFORCE THOSE STANDARDS DAY IN AND DAY OUT. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FOR LETTING ME ASK THIS QUESTION. THANK YOU SENATOR LAYERED HOT MINIMIZE CHAIR- LET ME GO TO YOU NEXT SO WE GIVE OUR OTHER COLLEAGUE TOM TO CATCH HER BREATH. AND LET THE RECORD REFLECT THAT THE- SENATOR GROWS WITH US. THANK YOU ARE A MAN CHAIR AND- GET MY NOTES HERE THE LAST PLACE. THIRTY SORRY I LOST MY PLACE AND WE HAD A VERY ON NICE CONVERSATION YESTERDAY ON. RANDOLPH AND I DO APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU TOOK THAT EXTRA TIME. TO DO OUR VIRTUAL- WE WANT WISH THAT IT WAS FACE TO FACE BUT I HAVEN'T HAD THAT OPPORTUNITY WE COVERED A NUMBER OF. ITEM OF. THAT I THOUGHT WERE VERY IMPORTANT. TO BRING FORWARD AND YOU ANSWERED- YOU KNOW VERY THOUGHTFULLY AND CERTAINLY- WITH ACCOUNTABILITY FOR. THE IMPACT THAT WE MIGHT HAVE. MORE IMPACT ON OUR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND I KNOW THAT I SPECIFICALLY NOTED ONE OF YOUR GOALS IS TO. SEEK A BALANCE IN TERMS OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS THAT WILL NEED TO BE MADE ON THE OUR CARGING STATIONS FOR EXAMPLE. IN ENSURING THAT SO WE DON'T PUT A GREATER BURDEN ON OUR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES THROUGH RATE PAYING. TO FINANCE THOSE I THINK ANOTHER ISSUE WE DISCUSSED WITH A CLEARLY THE COMPETITIVE ENOUGH. N MAKING SURE THAT WE CAN STAY COMPETITIVE- WITH OUR INTERNATIONAL NEIGHBORS. AND HOW THE REDUCTION OF. OUR THE- THE REDUCTION IN FOSSIL FUEL AND BASICALLY NO CARS PASSED BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE THAT ARE PRODUCED- HOUSE FOSSIL FUEL. ARE INDIAN ZERO THINK MYTHIC AND IN TERMS OF- THE JOBS THE GREEN JOBS. THAT ARE GOING TO BE REPLACING OUR JOBS THAT ARE IN THE OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION INDUSTRY I DO HAVE NUMBERS NOW SO IT BECOMES EVEN MORE IMPORTANT NOW AS- WE LOOK AT WHAT CARBS CHALLENGES GOING TO BE GOING IN THE- FUTURE I KNOW AND- THEIR SUB. OF FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS JOB. IN THE- OF. GREEN JABI IN KERN COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE AND DOWN THE OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION INDUSTRY IS- ON NINETY SEVEN THOUSAND ON HAS AN AVERAGE SO THAT'S A 41% REDUCTION. IN THE INCOME THAT'S AVAILABLE FROM THAT KIND OF. EMPLOYMENT FORTY FIFTH PUTTING THOSE THINGS BACK ON ON. YOU KNOW THE TABLE TO BE DISCUSSED IF YOU GO FORWARD WITH THE SCOPING PLAN AND NOW PROVIDING NOT HIM PUT. UP FROM OUR PUBLIC THOSE ARE THINGS THAT ARE VERY VERY. ARE PROBLEMATIC IN TERMS OF KEEPING OUR ECONOMY STRONG AND CERTAINLY PROVIDING FOR THE NEW WORKERS THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A VERY. WELL PAYING JOB. IN WHAT WOULD BECOME REALLY THE DOMINANT TE AND SO AS YOU TO TAKE A CO LOOK THAT ISSUE FORWARD- I HAVE A QUESTION. THAT IS BECAUSE FROM ACCOUNTS. THAT I'D LIKE TO ASK THAT I DIDN'T COVER YESTERDAY. BUT I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT ONE IF YOU TAKE OVER THE CHAIR AND YOU ARE REALLY. STRUCTURING A NEW LEADERSHIP. AND THERE WAS A CONCERN ABOUT THE- THERE WASN'T A DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY PASSED THE CHAIR TO BOARD MEMBERS- IN MAKING SOME OF THE DECISIONS ARE COMING FORTH WITH RECOMMENDATIONS. SO I THE QUESTION TO YOU IS WOULD YOU BE MORE WILLING TO HAVE LET'S SAY OUR TECHNICAL SUBCOMMITTEES THAT NEED MORE LIKE WHAT GOES ON OUT OF. OUR OTHER BOARDS. CANCEL THAT IT'S NOT FULL CENTRALIZED BUT IT'S MORE COLLABORATIVE AND SHE LOOK AT. THE ISSUES THAT COME BEFORE YOU OFF CERTAINLY THAT FOR THE WAY IT'S DONE MORE AT CPUC ARE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION. SO IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU'D BE TAKING A LOOK AT AND YOU SEE THEY HAVE AN IMPORTANT CHANGE THAT MIGHT BE NECESSARY AND I THINK THAT THAT GOES TO THE CREDIBILITY AND THE- CONFIDENCE OF THE PUBLIC WHEN THEY PROVIDED INPUT. THAT THERE'S BEEN LEVELS OF ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION AT EACH LEVEL BEFORE THAT'D THAT PARTICULAR RECOMMENDATION. COMES FORWARD TO THE BOARD PROPER. I'M SO I GUESS I WOULD SAY A COUPLE THINGS I THINK- HAS A MENTIONED IN MY OPENING COMMENTS I THINK AT TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE- EXPERTISE OF MY FELLOW BOARD MEMBERS REALLY IMPORTANT. AND SINCE I'VE- BEEN HERE IT'S BEEN- IT'S BEEN INTERESTING HEARING FROM DIFFERENT BOARD MEMBERS ABOUT ISSUES THAT THEY'RE INVOLVED IN- FOR INSTANCE YOU KNOW DOCTOR BOMB HIDDEN IS INVOLVED AND THAT QUITE A BIT IN THAT IN THE SIX SEVENTEEN- PROCESS- VICE CHAIR BURKE WAS VERY INVOLVED IN THE CREAMFIELDS REWARDS HE ENTERED- A BOARD MEMBER DALY TORY. VERY INVOLVED IN- IN GETTING HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES OUT ON THE STREET IN INTO- GARY MISSION HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES I SHOULD SAY- IN LOS ANGELES AND REALLY VERY ACTIVE IN THAT WORK- AND- ADVOCATING FOR AND- YOU KNOW FOR THE COURTS TO. RECOGNIZE THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES TO DEAL WITH- WITH THE- THE VEHICLES THAT ARE COMING IN AND OUT AT THOSE. LOCATIONS SO I ABSOLUTELY THINK IT'S- IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO RELY ON THE EXPERTISE OF MY FELLOW BOARD MEMBERS- TO THE EXTENT WE WANT TO THINK ABOUT THE IDEA OF HAVE TOO MANY YOU KNOW WE CAN CERTAINLY LOOK AT THAT. ONE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OF COURSE THE PC REYES THE AND THE FEES THE PERSON SINCE AND HIGHER BE IS THAT THAT THAT THOSE ARE FULL TIME BOARDS AND WHO HAVE SPECIFIC FULL TIME RESPONSIBILITIES- BUT YOU KNOW CERTAINLY HAPPY TO LOOK AT WAYS TO. INVOLVE THE BOARD MEMBERS. HERE AT HIGHS IN DECISION MAKING. THANK YOU I THINK A GOOD VERY IMPORTANT ON FOR THE PUBLIC HEAR THAT BECAUSE THAT IS I USUALLY THE- CRITICISM COMMON THAT WE- ARMS. WHEN I WAS LOW THE LEVEL AND ESPECIALLY ON THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN ORANGE COUNTY. THAT THERE DIDN'T SEEM TO BE A LOT OF THAT KIND OF INPUT THROUGH A COMMITTEE STRUCTURE. AND I AGAIN I HAVE BEING UP THE CONFIDENCE OF THE PUBLIC ON A LOT OF THINGS THAT. INITIALLY WILL BE DIFFICULT AS WE GO FORWARD AND I SPEAK I THINK WE SPOKE ABOUT THE TIMELINES TO. OUR TERROR RANDOLPH THAT SOMEBODY ELSE MIGHT BE A LITTLE- ENERGETIC. IN TERMS OF TIME LINES AND THERE MIGHT BE TECHNOLOGY THAT'S KIND OF WAITING OUT THERE PASSED TWENTY THIRTY FIVE THAT CAN HELP A LOT. R. AS WE MOVED TO THIS NEW- ENERGY LEVEL BUT I. APPRECIATE YOUR THOUGHTFUL COMMENTS. ABSOLUTELY YEAR YEAR ON BACKGROUND AND YOUR RESUME. OF ACT QUALIFIES YOU AS MY- GOOD COLLEAGUE TO MY RIGHT TO MENTIONED YOU KNOW WORKING FOR HIM I'M SURE THAT. YOU GOT YOUR MARCHING ORDERS MANY TIMES SO I. LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR SIX F. ABOUT CANNED DOG THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS TODAY. THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM VICE CHAIR SENATOR GROVE. THANK YOU MADAM MADAM PRETEND- I DO APOLOGIZE FOR BEING LATE I MIGHT I MIGHT HAVE MISSED SOME UESTIONS THAT WERE ASKED AND SO I APOLOGIZE IF I ASK THEM AGAIN. ONE YOU DID. TALK ABOUT THE OIL INDUSTRY AND FARMING INDUSTRY NO OLDER DURING COUNTY. ONLY KERN COUNTY SAN. SO MY SENATOR THERE HAS SAYS THAT HE COVERED MY DISTRICT SO- BUT I'M GONNA NOT TAKE THAT CHANCE AND CONTINUE TO ASK MY QUESTIONS IF IT'S OKAY WITH THE GOOD SENATOR- MY QUESTION IS- OBVIOUSLY A. FOR THE DIRECTOR BUT ALSO- YOU KNOW FOR ANYBODY THAT WANTS TO ANSWER- THE GOVERNOR RECENTLY A DUD DIRECTED IT OR LET ME KNOW SORRY WHAT YOU DID MISS IS WE'RE DO AND OTHER CHAIR ON HER OWN IN FIRST AND SO WE WILL MOVE TO THE OTHERS AFTER WE FINISH SO THAT'S GOOD NEWS FOR YOU YOU WON'T CUT IT YOU CAN JUST FOCUS DIRECTLY WITH HER AND THEY KNEW THAT BOTH YOU AND SENATOR CALM WATER HAD BUDGET SUB SO PEOPLE ARE AWARE. ALL RIGHT WELL THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR SO M. MADAM CHAIR THE GOVERNOR RECENTLY DIRECTED A OR B. TWO ABOUT EVALUATE PHASING OUT OIL AND GAS AND- YOU'RE A COMING SCHOOL BEING PLANNED AT THE END OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN UNDER THE ROWN ADMINISTRATION YOUR AGENCY FOUND THAT REASON RESTRICTING OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION CALIFORNIA. COULD ALSO RESULT IN THE COST OF A REGIONAL AND LOCAL ECONOMIES BEING AFFECTED INCLUDING LOSS OF EMPLOYMENT AND TAX REVENUE VITAL TO PROVIDING ESSENTIAL PUBLIC SERVICES ACROSS THE STATE- FOR INSTANCE KERN COUNTY NOT ONLY PRODUCES 70% OF THE STATE'S OIL THAT IS CONSUMED BY ALL CALIFORNIANS. BUT IT ALSO PRODUCES 51% OF THE SOLAR THAT IS CONSUMED BY ALL OF CALIFORNIANS IN VERY FEW PEOPLE KNOW THAT BUT OUR SOLAR ISN'T NORTH AND SOUTH EVEN THOUGH USE YOUR LAND OUR LAND TIP- PRODUCE THE SOLAR. ELECTRICITY THAT HELPS MEET THE GREENHOUSE. GAS EMISSION REDUCTION GOALS. AND THE PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE IS WITH OUR OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY THEY PAY LOCAL TAXES WHERE WE CAN TAKE CARE OF FIREFIGHTERS SCHOOL DISTRICTS. LIBRARIES THINGS LIKE THAT- OUR SOLAR COMPANIES DON'T PAY LOCAL TAXES AND WE LOSE ABOUT TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. AND IN. MANY THAT'S USED TO BENEFIT OUR COMMUNITY EVEN THOUGH WE- WE PRODUCE 51% OF THE STATE'S SOLAR WE GET NO BENEFIT FROM THAT. SO I'M WONDERING IF- YOU ANTICIPATE THE FINDINGS FROM YOUR RESEARCH REPORT DID THEY CHANGE. AND WILL YOU RELY ON THE PREVIOUS ANALYSIS WE TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE. THAT LIKE I SAID PRODUCE 70% OF THE STATE'S OIL IT HELPS US PREVENT OIL FROM BEING SHIPPED IN FROM ECUADOR NICARAGUA. VENEZUELA I MEAN ALL THESE OTHER PLACES THAT WE HAVE OIL SHIPPED IN BECAUSE OUR CONSUMPTION HASN'T GONE DOWN. AND AGAIN OUR COMMUNITY PRODUCES 51% OF THE SOLAR BUT WE GET NO CREDIT FOR IT SO. I GUESS MY GOING BACK TO THE EXACT QUESTION IS DO YOU ANTICIPATE FINDINGS FROM A RECENT REPORT TO HAVE CHANGED- WE RELY ON YOUR PREVIOUS ANALYSIS. IS THEIR DIFFERENCES AND HOW DO YOU PLAN TO RECONCILE THEM. SO WE WILL AND WE WILL LOOK AT PREVIOUS ANALYSES THAT HAVE BEEN DONE AND- AND- MORE CURRENT ANALYSIS THAT AND HAS BEEN DONE MORE RECENTLY AND- AND I'LL- RELEVANT AND- AS THAT. IT IS ECONOMIC AND TECHNICAL ANALYSIS THAT WE CAN IS KIND OF THE SHORT AFTER YOU KNOW WE ALWAYS WANT TO MAKE SURE WE ARE AND- GATHERING THE BEST DATA- TO HELP US DO THIS WORK- IN THE IN THE PLAN ITSELF WE WILL BE ANALYZING- PURSUANT TO THE- THE GOVERNOR'S REQUEST- IT. STRATEGIES AROUND- GETTING TO CARBON NEUTRALITY BY PACOLLI BOTH SUPPLY AND DEMAND CAN YOU RAISE THE KEY ISSUE IN YOUR QUESTION ABOUT- CONCEPTION- AND SO I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT STEPPING PLAN TO- ANALYZE WAYS THAT WE CAN ACHIEVE CARBON NEUTRALITY BOTH LOOKING AT SUPPLY AND DEMAND- SO THAT WE CAN UNDERSTAND WAYS THAT WE CAN TRANSITION AWAY FROM FOSSIL FUELS IN- IN OUR VARIOUS ACTIVITIES WITHIN THE STATE- SO WILL BE ANALYZING- YOU KNOW BOTH OF THOSE STATES- VERY THOROUGHLY AND- AND WE WILL CERTAINLY BE LOOKING AT. ECONOMIC AND- THAT THEIR TAX BY UP. THANK YOU I THANK YOU VERY MUCH. TO ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS IF YOU DON'T MIND ON TRANSPORTATION AND IN GHG EMISSIONS- I HOPE THAT'S OKAY. SO WHAT FACTORS ARE YOU GONNA CONSIDER WHEN EVALUATING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CLIMATE CHANGE POLICIES SCIENCE BASED COLLECTIVE LIKE I EVEN- SCIENCE BASED ARE COST EFFECTIV REGULATIONS TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL MARKET BASED STRATEGIES. TO REDUCE M. GHG- SO WE- WILL BE RELYING ON- AS MUCH AS AT MODELING AND ANALYSIS AS WE CAN WITH REGARDS TO UNDERSTANDING- WHAT EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS WE WILL BE ACHIEVING- THROUGH VARIOUS STRATEGIES. AND HOW AND IT. DEPLOYING ARE TRANSPORTATION GOLD IN ALL OF OUR SECTORS THE HEAVY DUTY SECTOR THE LIKE THE SECTOR OFF ROAD- YOU KNOW WHAT ARE THEIR STRATEGIES- THAT WILL REDUCE GHG EMISSIONS REDUCTION- WILL ALSO BE LOOKING AT THINGS LIKE VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED WHICH IS. NOT NOT FULLY- PART OF CARBS JURISDICTION IN TERMS OF THE STRATEGIES THAT WE WANT TO IDENTIFY- AND- AND TO DISCUSS THE POTENTIAL STRATEGIES. THAT WOULD- YEAH CUCURBITA BY TWENTY FIVE. OKAY SINCE YOU BROUGHT IT LEGAL MAS TRAVEL AND I KNOW THERE'S A SENATOR IN THIS BUILDING THAT REPRESENTS I THINK TWENTY SIX SQUARE BLOCKS OF LOS ANGELES TWENTY SIX BLOCKS YOU COULD WALKER DISTRICT- A. I. DRIVE. EIGHT HUNDRED MILES A WEEK BECAUSE MY DISTRICT FROM MY DISTRICT OFFICE TO THE FOR THIS SOUTHERN SOUTHEASTERN PART OF MY DISTRICT. IS FIVE HOURS AND FORTY SIX MINUTES. FROM THE MOST EAST PART OF MY DISTRICT NOT SEVENTY SOUTHEAST BUT THE MOST EASE PART IT'S TWO HOURS AND FORTY FIVE MINUTES. AND THEN TO THE WEST IT'S AN HOUR AND FIFTY MINUTES INTO THE NORTH IT'S AN HOUR AND FORTY MINUTES. SO I PUT SEVEN HUNDRED MILES A WEEK AT MINIMUM ON MY CAR JUST DRIVING BACK AND FORTH FROM SACRAMENTO BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE YOUR TRAVEL. FROM BAKERSFIELD TO S. SACRAMENTO. AS THE VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED TO PEOPLE IN MY COMMUNITY WHICH SEEMS TO BE ON THE TARGET LIST A LOT. AND YEAH. IT IS FRUSTRATING TO ME A. N. I'M JUST SHARING MY FRUSTRATION WITH YOU IS THAT. WE ARE A COMMUNITY THAT HAS TO DRIVE THE MOST MILES IN THE STATE BECAUSE WE'RE A RULE EVERYWHERE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. WE PRODUCE- WE'RE THE SECOND LARGEST FOOD PRODUCER IN THE ENTIRE WORLD MY DISTRICT PRODUCES ALL THE FOOD THAT YOU GUYS EAT. AND BUT FARMERS ARE ATTACKED AND THEIR RESOURCES BOARD- ACTUALLY DOES% HAVE- A LOT OF POLICIES AND I REALIZE IT WERE BROUGHT FORTH BY THIS BUILDING INNER FALLING REGULATORY PROCESSES. THAT WERE INSTITUTED IN POLICY. BUT THEY'RE STRUGGLING NOW YOU KNOW THEY HAVE TO REPLACE VEHICLES AND EQUIPMENT. THAT IS FOUR YEARS OLD IN THIS EQUIPMENT WAS MEANT TO LAST FOR. YEARS I MEAN TWENTY YEARS YOU KNOW COTTON JENNER THAT YOU KNOW IF FOUR THOUSAND OUR PIECE OF EQUIPMENT IT SHOULD LAST TWENTY YEARS NOT FOUR YEARS. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO AND THEN OF COURSE THE OIL INDUSTRY WHICH I'M VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT AND- BUT YOU KNOW WE'RE USING IT AND IF WE DON'T PRODUCE IT HERE SAFELY AND ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY. IN THE MOST RESTRICTIVE ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY EVER AND WE'RE GONNA GET IT FROM OTHER COUNTRIES WHERE THEY DON'T HAVE THE SAME ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES AND BRING IT OVER HER BY BUNKER FUEL WHICH- CAUSES MORE GEE SHEEN IN ANYTHING EVER- PRODUCED INCLUDING DIESEL TRACKS. M. SO GOING TO CAP AND TRADE BASED ON THAT COMMENT AND I'M SORRY FOR THAT LEGALLY COMMENT AND- GOING TO CAP AND TRADE. IN YOUR VIEW WHAT THE WHAT WHAT HOW LARGE OF A ROLE DO YOU THINK THAT CAP AND TRADE PROGRAMS. HAVE A TV IN THE STATE'S CLIMATE GOALS. SO THAT IS A KEY ISSUE WILL BE WE WILL BE LOOKING AT IN THE SCRIPTING PLAN IN TERMS OF- UNDERSTANDING- WHAT ARE DIFFERENT STRATEGIES ARE AND HOW MUCH- EMISSIONS REDUCTION WE CAN ACHIEVE. WITH EACH STRATEGY THAT WILL BE A KEY FOCUS OF THE ANALYSIS IN THE UPCOMING SKIPPING PLAN. OKAY DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON HOW CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM- COULD BE IMPROVED. I THINK THAT. THERE ARE AS AND I WAS MENTIONING EARLIER MAYBE LIKE YOU RAN YOUR OTHER HEARING AND HE HAD A CAP AND TRADE STRUCTURE AND- THE REGULATORY STRUCTURE GOES WITH IT HAS EVOLVED OVER THE YEARS- RIGHT NOW AND WE ARE SORT OF TAKING THE PROGRAM AS IT IS- WE RECENTLY MADE CHANGES IN RESPONSE TO LEGISLATION- AND SO THAT THOSE CHANGES- HAVE RECENTLY GONE INTO A FACT AND- WE'RE UNDERTAKING ARE SCOPING PLAN ANALYSIS. AND THEN AFTER THAT- YOU KNOW I THINK WE WOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE WHAT IT CHANGES IF ANY WE SHOULD CONSIDER MAKING- TO THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM- OKAY. WHEN DO YOU THINK THE HIGH SPEED RAIL BECOME CARBON NEUTRAL. PERFECT I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION. ASIDE THROUGHOUT THEIR. I DON'T EITHER OKAY. ALL QUIT QUIT AND I WANT TO THANK YOU MA'AM FOR YOUR M. QUESTIONS FOR ANSWERING MY QUESTIONS AND AGAIN I'M SORRY I'M VERY DEFENSIVE ABOUT MY COMMUNITY THAT SEEMS TO BE UNDER ATTACK BY ALL AGENCIES IN THIS BUILDING. N. M. ALL'S WE ARE DOING IS TRYING TO MEET THAT HELP THE GOVERNOR NEEDS CLIMATE GOALS AT LIKE I SAID GENERATED FROM MY COUNTY ONE COUNTY- AND- ANNA. IT'S FRUSTRATING THAT IT JUST SEEMS LIKE IT'S CONSTANTLY UNDER ATTACK. SO I APPRECIATE YOU ANSWERING MY QUESTIONS AND THANK YOU FOR. OF HAVING THE COURAGE TO TAKE ON THIS ROLE THAT YOU ARE GETTING READY YOU ARE ASSUMING. THANK YOU SENATOR SENATOR GROWTH THANK YOU WE DO KNOW ARE YOUR PASSION ABOUT YOUR COMMUNITY AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR DIPLOMACY. YOU ASKED TOUGH QUESTIONS- I WAS SERIOUS IN THAT REMARK- LET ME LET ME DO THIS WHILE WE KIßM BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHEN PEOPLE WILL BE CALLED THE WAY WITHOUT RESPECT. MADAM CHAIR CAN I ASK THE SECRETARY TO OPEN THE ROLE IF YOU'RE READY SENATOR GROWTH WE DID- WE DID SOME CONSENT ITEMS WHICH WERE- GOVERNOR'S APPOINTEES NOT REQUIRED TO APPEAR WE DID NOT SEPARATE THE VOTES FOR I DID TOO. F. AND G. SO THEY WERE TOGETHER- AND ITEM NUMBER THREE THE BILL WERE FOR OLD CAN WE OPEN THOSE AND ADD ON YOUR VOTE AT THIS POINT OKAY ABSOLUTELY JUST IN CASE- SOMEONE HAS TO LEAVE AGAIN MADAM SECRETARY WILL YOU OPEN THE ROLE ON ITEM. TWO F. AND G. GROVE I RUFAI FIVE TWO ZERO FIVE TWO ZERO- THAT IS OUT THANK YOU AND ITEM THREE. ROW FIVE GROUP HI FIVE TWO ZERO FIVE ZERO THE BILL REFERRALS ARE OUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANKS FOR LETTING ME DO THAT AND SENATOR COM LAGER I'M NOW COMING TO YOU FOR QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS- FOR CHAIR RUTH RANDOLPH RANDOLPH THANK YOU MADAM. PRO TEM AND GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN SECRETARY- I HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE OF BEING ABLE TO- FIRST CHAT WITH YOU WHEN YOU CAME TO OUR- CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS. AND EVERYONE WAS THRILLED ABOUT THIS APPOINTMENT AND OF COURSE WE TWO ARE QUITE PASSIONATE ABOUT. ISSUES IMPACTING OUR A DISTRICT IN THE WORK- AND THE LEGACY OF CARP SO. I KNOW MY- CALLING FROM SANTA CRUZ ASKED THIS QUESTION WHILE I WAS GONE SO- FEEL FREE TO. NOT REPEAT YOURSELF BUT- THERE HAVE BEEN A COUPLE OF CRITICISMS THAT HAVE BEEN LEVIED- AT CAR PROBABLY MORE THAN TWO BUT I'LL JUST RAISE TWO- ONE IS THAT IT PLAYS TO AN INTERNATIONAL AUDIENCE AND NOT TO EVERY DAY CALIFORNIANS ACROSS THE STATE. AND THAT THE SECOND IS- THAT IT'S RUN BY STAFF AND OVER THE BOARD- AND SO JUST WANTED TO KNOW IF YOU COULD SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THESE CRITICISMS AND THE TONE THAT YOUR LEADERSHIP IS GOING TO TAKE PROBABLY AND- YOU KNOW MAYBE COURSE CORRECTING- SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS OR- YOU KNOW PAST AGGRESSIONS. AND YES SO THAT WHICH REGARD TO OUR INTERNATIONAL VERSUS IN STATE FOCUSED I THINK HIGHER. HAS NOT- HAS NOT WAVERED FROM THE IN STATE FOCUS THAT WE HAVE CONTINUED TO. ADOPT REGULATIONS AND ENFORCE THOSE REGULATIONS THAT ADDRESS. AIR POLLUTION AND- THATIS THE PATRICK'S HERE- IN OUR COMMUNITY IN CALIFORNIA- WE BY FAR MOST OF OUR EMPLOYEES AT THE AGENCY WORK ON- THOSE KIND OF BREAD AND BUTTER- AIR QUALITY ISSUES- AND THEY'RE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO THE AGENCY AND WILL. CONTINUE EVERYTHING AS I MENTIONED BEFORE FRIEND AT FROM HOUSING GOING VESSELS TO FERRIES TO OPERATE EQUIPMENT- BOTH I REGULATORY PROGRAMS AND OUR INCENTIVE PROGRAMS ARE REALLY- INTENDED TO REDUCE- OZONE AND PARTICULATE MATTER- AND- AND- DO THE BEST WE CAN TO. ACHIEVE CLEAN AIR ACT ACT THE PAYMENT IN CALIFORNIA AND THAT CONTINUES. TO BE A KEY FOCUS AND IT'S ALSO SOMETHING THAT I FEEL- I CAN THAT. AB SPEND MORE TIME CAP ABOUT AND A LITTLE MORE TIME HIGHLIGHTING BECAUSE I REALLY DON'T WANT WANT FOLKS TO FORGET THAT THAT WORK IS HAPPENING- WHICH REGARD TO AND- THAT YOU KNOW THAT STAFF AND THE BOARD I THINK- WE ARE AT A VERY LARGE BOARD AND- AND WE HAVE. A LOT OF EXPERTISE THAT WE ARE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE AS- AND I THINK ONE OF MY GOALS AS CHAIR IS TO MAKE SURE THAT BOARD MEMBERS HAVE. ACCESS TO ALL THE INFORMATION THAT THEY NEED TO MAKE DECISIONS THAT. BASS MAKE THEMSELVES AVAILABLE TO PROVIDE THREE THINGS- AND TAKE INPUT. FROM BOARD MEMBERS AND SO I HOPE THAT IF ANY BOARD MEMBERS FEEL LIKE THAT'S NOT HAPPENING THAT THEY WILL REACH OUT TO ME. AND I'LL BE HAPPY TO TRY TO INTERVENE AND MAKE SURE THINGS RUN MORE SMOOTHLY- BUT I ALSO THINK THAT. WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY IN OUR MONTHLY AND CONTAINS MORE THAN MONTHLY MEETINGS Q. AND- REALLY MAKE SURE THAT BOARD MEMBERS HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE THEIR THOUGHTS AND SHARE THEIR LEADERSHIP. IT'S CHALLENGING BECAUSE- AND- WHEN YOU HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENT MEMBERS THEY HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS TO YOU. AND AND SO IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT IF BOARD MEMBERS WERE SORT OF CALLING UP STAFF AND HAVING THEM. IT'S DIFFERENT ACTIONS THAT MAY NOT REFLECT THE CONSENSUS REPORT SO AS A RESULT THAT REALLY NEEDS IS VERY IMPORTANT IN OUR BOARD MEETING AND THAT THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY. TO GAIN AT A COLLECTIVE UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE BOARD DIRECTION IS AND WHAT THE NEXT STEPS ARE THAT WE EXPECT. FOR STAFF- AND SO IT'S MICHAEL IN RUNNING THE MEETING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO HAVE THAT- ROBUST INTERACTION- AND THAT WE'RE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE ACTION THAT WE WANT TO PROVIDE TO STAFF. OR THANK YOU FOR THAT- YOU KNOW PART OF THE QUESTION WAS ALSO BASED ON. PERSONAL EXPERIENCE- OF WORKING ON POLICIES AND- ACTUALLY. BEING SO FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO HAVE- THE PRO TEM BE HELPFUL TO SOME OF THAT BUT NEEDING THAT EXTRA PUSH BECAUSE OF- THE BUREAUCRACY- AT THE A. R. B. AND- GETTING THE DISTINCT FEELING THAT IT WAS NOT REALLY DRIVEN BY- BOARD POLICIES- BUT BY OTHER ENTIIES AND SO I JUST WANTED TO SORT OF. YOU KNOW ELEVATE THAT BUT I AM TRUSTING IN THIS NEW LEADERSHIP AND IN YOUR VISION. NOT VERY MUCH SO. OKAY SO I FEEL LIKE I'M GONNA YOU KNOW ASK THE BLACK PEOPLE QUESTION- BECAUSE THERE WAS A LETTER THAT WAS SHARED- QUITE WIDELY WRITTEN BY- BLACKSTAFF I THINK WHEN I ASKED YOU THIS QUESTIONI ALSO SAID THAT I HOPE THAT THERE WAS NO RETALIATION HAPPENING AGAINST THEM BECAUSE OFTEN TIMES ARE VERY KEEN ARE YOU CAN COUNT THE NUMBER OF. FOLKS OF COLOR ON YOUR HAND AND SO IT'S KIND OF EASY TO FIGURE OUT WHO WROTE WHAT AND SIGNED WHAT EVEN IF THEY WANT TO BE ANONYMOUS. BUT THE LETTER SPEAKS TO- A NUMBER OF ISSUES M. AND ON A NUMBER OF LEVELS- AND REALLY YOU KNOW MICROAGGRESSION THAN BIAS EAST RIGHT- WITH REGARDS TO HOW PEOPLE ARE TREATED HOW THEY ARE SEEN. AND HOW THEY ARE VALUED. AND THAT OFTENTIMES GENERALLY ALSO TRANSLATES INTO- PROGRAMMING- AND FUNDING AND HOW COMMUNITIES ARE SEEN AND TREATED AND VALUED- WHICH THEN CAN LEAD DOWN THE ROAD TO YOU KNOW WHO'S GETTING FUNDING HOW COMMUNITIES ARE MARGINALIZED ETCETERA SO. WOULD LOVE TO HEAR SORT OF YOUR THOUGHTS ON- WHAT HAS TRANSPIRED SINCE- THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE LETTER I KNOWTHERE WAS THE DARE CHALLENGE AND THERE'S BEEN SOME INTROSPECTIVE AND INTROSPECTION THERE WAS THIS CARP RESOLUTION. THOSE ARE ALL GREAT BUT WOULD JUST SORT OF LIKE TO HEAR YOUR RESPONSE ABOUT ALL OF THOSE THINGS SO IT'S AS MUCH ABOUT THE INTERNAL POLICIES AND PRACTICES YES AND STAFF AND THEN SORT OF HOW THAT'S TRANSLATING INTO PROGRAMMING- THAT SUPPORTIVE OF COMMUNITIES. ACROSSTHE STATE WHO PROBABLY FEEL LIKE CAR DOESN'T KNOW WHO THEY ARE- YEAH THE LETTER- FROM THE BLACK EMPLOYEES WAS A EXPECT EXPEDIENCY YOU KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE SUFFER IN SILENCE AND DON'T SAY ANYTHING AND TO HAVE THOSE EMPLOYEES PICK UP THE MAYOR. THAT REFLECTED BACK AT THE AGENCY AND SAY YOU NEED TO CHANGE- IS IT WILL. SO IMPORTANT AND SO- MEANINGFUL TO ME. PERSONALLY AS I COME IN AND TAKE THIS THIS ROLE ONLINE- WE HAVE A LOT TO DO AND A LONG WAY TO GO BUT WE- ARE. I BELIEVE US TO A GOOD START BEFORE I CAME TO THE AGENCY- KEY EXECUTIVE OFFICER FORM COULD BE AT THAT THEIR TASK FORCE- AND THEY BEGAN WORKING ON THINGS SUCH AS- ROLLING OUT AN IMPLICIT BIAS TRAINING LOOKING AT INTERVIEW PANELS AND HOW THOSE CAN BE. IMPROVED AND FURTHER- THAT DIVERSITY- LOOKING AT RECRUITMENT- OPPORTUNITIES TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE MAKE OUR CREATE A RECRUITMENT MORE PRIDE- AT LOOKING AT- YOU KNOW BEYOND THE USUAL PLACES AND REALLY- BEING INTENTIONAL- IN IN WELCOMING- A WIDER VARIETY OF APPLICANTS AS POSSIBLE- AND REALLY ELEVATING THE DISCUSSION OF RACE THROUGHOUT THE AGENCY- THAT TASK FORCE HAS SPONSORED- THESE AMAZING PANELS WHERE AT EMPLOYEES- JUST TALK ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCES IN LIFE AND AT HIGHER- AND- YOUR POINT YOU KNOW TO THE MICROGRAPHS INDICATE EXPERIENCE. THE CHALLENGES THAT THEY'VE HAD- AND DOES. HAVE BEEN- REALLY AN I BENEFITS I Q. CAN MANY OF AT AGENCY- WHAT ONE MORE INTERNAL NOTES AND YOU KNOW OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICER COREY HAS ASSEMBLED AN INCREDIBLY DIVERSE SENIOR LEADERSHIP TEAM OUR OUR STRUCTURE IS THAT THE BOARD CHOOSES THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER EXECUTIVE OFFICER THAN TO TEAM AS- DEPUTY EXECUTIVE OFFICER TO- HE SUPERVISED AT WORK AND- THAT TEAM IS- BIT HAS BEEN- YOU KNOW INCREASED AND NEARLY- CONSTITUTED- OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS AND IT'S A TEAM OF INCREDIBLY EXPERIENCED. AND TALENTED PEOPLE WHO- WHO LOOK LIKE CALIFORNIA- AND THAT IS. THAT LEADERSHIP IS VERY MUCH APPRECIATED- WHICH FOR. TO THE EXTERNAL ISSUES I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT YES- IF AN AGENCY IS NOT. UNDERSTANDING THE LIVES AND THE LIVED EXPERIENCE OF UNDER REPRESENTED PEOPLE THEN IT IS NOT VERY DIFFICULT PICTURE. PEOPLE AND SO AND THE- THINK ABOUT- WORKING WITH COMMUNITIES. I THINK THE WAY I EIGHT- VIEW IT IS THE FIRST STEP IS TO LISTEN TO COMMUNITIES AND UNDERSTAND WHAT THEIR ISSUES ARE AND WHAT THE CHALLENGES ARE AND IN THEIR- AT. THAT LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND NOT TO ASSUME THAT WE KNOW SORT OF WHAT THE SOLUTIONIS AND WHAT THE AND WITH THE RIGHT STRATEGY IS- BUT TO REALLY MAKE IT A MORE OF A COLLABORATIVE DISCUSSION- I WAS TALKING TO- AND ACTIVISTS THE OTHER DAY. THAT THAT- THAT FRONTLINE COMMUNITIES ARE THE ONES WHO LIVE WITH THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. AND SO IN DEVELOPING OUR REGULATORY WORK AND OUR PROGRAMMING IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO- UNDERSTAND WHAT THOSE POTENTIAL UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES ARCH- AND THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN DO THAT IS BY REALLY HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH THE COMMUNITY AND UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE COMMUNITY WANTS AND HOW THOSE- THAT. PROGRAMS ARE AFFECTING THOSE COMMUNITIES- AND SO I'M REALLY- I HAVE BEEN IMPRESSED WITH THE TEAM WE HAVE HERE- AT CARP WORKING ON A IN OUR COMMUNITY AIR PROTECTION- AT OUR OFFICE IF YOU NEED A YEAR PROTECTION- AND- AND I HOPE THAT OUR CONTINUED WORK- WITH REGARD TO- SCOPING PLAN AND- EIGHTY SIX POINT SEVEN AND ALL OF THE DIFFERENT WAYS THAT WE ARE. IN COMMUNITIES AND INTERACTING- AND BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS BECAUSE THOSE RELATIONSHIPS ON TOPICS AROUND- A LOCAL AND- RECEIVING A- IT MIGHT MIGHT ALSO YOU KNOW YOU WANT YOU YOU YOU WANT MAY WANT TO HAVE ANOTHER CONVERSATION ABOUT THE TRACKS IN THEIR COMMUNITY OR OTHER ISSUES THEIR THING IN THE COMMUNITY- AND SO AVOIDING THE SILOS OF ALL OF OUR DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS AND REALLY TRYING TO ENGAGE. WITH COMMUNITIES ABOUT THE TOPICS THAT THAT THEY WANT TO TALK ABOUT- IS THAT- I THINK THE BEST WAY WE CAN MOVE FORWARD AND IMPROVE THE WAY WE WORK WITH COMMUNITIES. WELL YOU KNOW I COULDN'T AGREE WITH YOU MORE ON THAT I DO WANT TO SAY AS YOU WERE. TALKING I LOOKED I SCROLLED ON DOWN THE WEBSITE AND- DEFINITELY HAVE. A- A GROUP OF LEADERS ON YOUR EXECUTIVE TEAM THAT ARE REFLECTIVE OF CALIFORNIA BUT I JUST CAUTION THAT WOULD YOU KNOW AS I TRY TO TELL MYSELF THAT WE THINK OUTSIDE OF THE BOX BECAUSE YOU YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A SISTER WHO'S HANDLING E. J. SO THAT'S ALWAYS LIKE PUTTING A BLACK PERSON IN CHARGE OF DIVERSITY- AND THEN YOU HAVE A SISTER IN TURN. IN TERMS AT RUNNING INTERNAL OPERATIONS AND THAT SORT OF MAKES ME THINK OF THE GS AND WE HAVE CERTAINLY A WHOLE BUNCH OF FOLKS OF COLOR. MAKING SURE THAT OUR OFFICES ARE CLEAN- BUT WE DO PEOPLE OF COLOR DO FAR MORE THAN THAT- AND SO. IF WE CAN EXPAND OUR- OPTIONS TO BE MORE INCLUSIVE IN WAYS THAT MAY MAKE SOME OF US UNCOMFORTABLE- I THINK THAT'S WHEN WE HAVE MUCH MORE RICH DISCUSSIONS- WHICH LEADS INTO WHAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT ABOUT COMMUNITIES. AND THEREFORE LISTENING WE SEE HOW ROBUST AND VIBRANT- AND NON MONOLITHIC- COMMUNITIES ARE AND THEIR NEEDS ARE- YOU KNOW I TRUST. THAT UNDER YOUR LEADERSHIP THE BOARD WILL BE DRIVING THE POLICIES. THAT ARE FOCUSED ON CALIFORNIANS- AND THAT WILL REALLY PRIORITIZE THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE SUFFERING FROM- POLLUTION HERE. AND I JUST. YOU KNOW AS YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT AVOIDING SILOS. WHEN I THINK I. WAS REFLECTING ON AN ARIAL TOUR THAT I TOOK OF MY DISTRICT AND THEN THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE DISTRICT I SAW NO TREES. BUT I SAW SO MANY- CONCRETE SIDEWALKS AND ROOFS THERE WERE NO GREEN CANOPIES. THERE ARE NO E. V. FACILITIES- THERE WERE NO INNOVATIVE HUBS- AND WHEN I WENT TO THE NORTHERN PART IN THE WESTERN PART OF THE DISTRICT I COULD EVEN SEE HOMES. BECAUSE OF HOW- AGGRESSIVE YOU KNOW THE GREEN CANOPY IS BUT AND I CERTAINLY SAW THE INNOVATIVE HOBBS I'M AN EEEE FACILITIES WHERE FOLKS ARE IN THESE OFFICES THINKING AND DREAMING OF A WAY- TO CREATE TECHNOLOGY THAT WILL GREEN AND CLEAN CALIFORNIA. YOU KNOW THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE DISTRICT WANTS CLEAN AIR TO. THEY WANT CLEAN JOBS THEY WANT TO BUILD THOSE JOBS THEY WANT TO BUILD THE FACILITIES WITH THAT KIND OF TECHNOLOGY IS BEING INVESTIGATED AND THEY WANT TO BUY THOSE PRODUCTS RIGHT AT PRICES THAT THEY CAN AFFORD. AND SO YOU KNOW MY DISTRICT ALSO HAS THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF FOLKS WERE UNEMPLOYED. PEOPLE WANT TO WORK. AND THEY WANT CLEAN AIR AND CLEAN WATER AND SO I'M JUST ASKING THAT YOU ALL NOT FORGET DON'T FORGET ABOUT BAKERSFIELD I KNOW SANTA CRUZ WON'T LET YOU FORGET ABOUT SANTA CRUZ BUT DON'T FORGET ABOUT SOUTH LA. YOU KNOW I GO TO MY BOOTH WHO SAID HE HAD TO GET MY SUB BRANDS AND ALL THAT AND WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT CARD THEY THINK YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT YOUR DIET AND THAT SHOULD NOT BE THAT SHOULD NOT BE THE CASE- SHOULD FEEL LIKE CARB. IS LOOKING OUT FOR THEM REGARDLESS OF THEIR ZIP CODE AND SO I'M JUST ASKING YOU. ON BEHALF OF MY DISTRICT AND C. L. B. C. THAT YOU TAKE THAT BACK TO CARP. BECAUSE WHEN WE ARE WANTING CARP TO STAND FOR US. THANK YOU MAY I AGREE THANK YOUNG. WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I WOULD SAY THAT A LOT OF THE QUESTIONS OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ASKED THAT IS ALWAYS THE BENEFIT OF GOING LAST I MIGHT ADD- I HAVE TO SAY I. YOU'VE SERVED AT THE C. P. U. C. YOU'RE NOW AT- CARB YOU KNOW YOU JUST NEED TO ADD THE COASTAL COMMISSION AND YOU'LL HAVE THE TRIFACTA OF AGENCIES THAT PEOPLE LOVE TO CRITICIZE- BUT REALLY DUE TO THE IMPORTANT YET COMPLEX RULES REGULATIONS- THAT YOU HAVE TO OVERSEE THAT REALLY IMPACT OUR EVERYDAY LIVES AND I JUST HAVE TO SAY- YOU OBVIOUSLY LIKE A CHALLENGE- YOU OBVIOUSLY. BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT TO TAKE THAT ON AND TO FOLLOW ALONG WITH WHAT MY- TO COLLEAGUES WHO MORE RECENTLY SPOKE. YOU KNOW I REPRESENT COMMUNITIES THAT INCLUDE THE PORT OF SAN DIEGO NEXT TO BAR YOU LOGIN WHERE- YOU KNOW COMMUNITIES OF COLOR HAVE LIVE THERE AND THEY DEAL WITH THE ENVIRO CREEN AND- THEY PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO. ALL OF THE RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO HELP THOSE COMMUNITIES. BUT I ALSO GREW UP IN A IN A PLACE MUCH LIKE CENTRAL VALLEY AND LIKE BAKERSFIELD WHERE- YOU KNOW YOU GOTTA UNDERSTAND THAT COMMUNITIES ARE NOT YET. ABLE TO TRANSITION- INTO NEW ECONOMIES- MY DAD WAS A COAL MINER SO YOU KNOW WHEN YOU TAKE AWAY THE WHOLE INDUSTRY OUT OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND WEST VIRGINIA. YOU'VE GOT TO BE AWARE OF WHAT YOU DO AS AS GOVERNMENT TO ACTUALLY REPLACE OR TO TRANSITION IN A WAY THAT IS RESPECTFUL TO PEOPLE WHO COME OUT OF THOSE INDUSTRIES- TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM BAKERSFIELD. YOU KNOW SHE TALKED ABOUT THE COTTON JENNER. AND THOSE PIECES OF EQUIPMENT AND I AM ALWAYS GOING TO BE REALLY SUPPORTIVE OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE PROVIDE THOSE RESOURCES TO HELP PEOPLE TRANSITION. I LOOK FORWARD. TO THE GLOBAL PARTICIPATION AND ARE GOING AGAIN TO COP TWENTY SIX. THIS YEAR THE CLIMATE CHANGE CONFERENCE WERE CALIFORNIA WENT IN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND WE WERE PERCEIVED AS- YOU KNOW I REMEMBER GOVERNOR BROWN WAS PERCEIVED TO BE A ROCK STAR- BECAUSE OF THE WORK THAT CALIFORNIA DOES- YOU KNOW YOU HAD A FORMER REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR. THERE YOU HAD GOVERNOR BROWN YOU HAD OFF THE CHAIR OF CARB- THERE- ARE AND AT THE SAME TIME YOU KNOW THEY LOOK TO CALIFORNIA AND I LIKE TO SAY WE HAVE THE SUBNATIONAL. AREAS AND REGIONS IN CALIFORNIA TO THAT WE HAVE TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT WE CANNOT OVERLOOK THESE OTHER COMMUNITIES- AND LAUD OUR SUCCESSES IF WE'RE NOT PREPARED TO. SPEND SOME OF THOSE RESOURCES AS LIMITED AS THEY ARE I JUST TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO SUPPORT THOSE COMMUNITIES SO I JUST WANTED TO MAKE THOSE COMMENTS BECAUSE I THINK. OF EVERYBODY IS INVESTED IN HOW YOU ACT AND YOUR SCOPING PLAN AND WHAT IT MEANS FOR THOSE COMMUNITY THEIR COMMUNITY OUR COMMUNITIES. AND OUR ABILITY TO HEAR EACH OTHER IS WHAT I THINK IS MOST IMPORTANT. AND GIVEN THAT MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ASKED ALL THESE OTHER QUESTIONS- AND INTO WHICH I THINK YOU ADDRESSED IT IN YOUR OPENING STATEMENT IN TERMS OF. HOW. YOU'RE GOING TO APPROACH. THIS IS IN YOUR ROW IS TO HOW YOU WENT TO WORK WITH OTHER-BOARD TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR- AGENDAS AND THEIR PRIORITIES I THINK YOU YOU ADDRESS THAT. I YOU'RE RESPONDING TO A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS- AND THEN THEY'LL THE ONLY QUESTION THAT I COULD POSSIBLY HAVE LEFT REALLY FROM ABROAD FIFTY THOUSAND FOOT LEVEL. IS THE IMPORTANT FUNCTION OF THE CHAIR- ADVISING THE GOVERNOR AND COMMUNICATING WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON THE WORK OF THE BOARD AND YOUR ROLE AND HOW YOU HOPE TO WORK WITH US AS LEGISLATORS. YOU KNOW I'M SURE THAT IT WILL BE A JOY TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE FORMER US SECRETARY OF NATURAL RESOURCES. BUT I HAVE A FEELING YOU'RE GOING TO GET MORE CALLS FROM OUR- LEGISLATORS WHO MAYBE HAVE NOT ENJOYED THAT DIRECT RELATIONSHIP AND I JUST WANTED YOU TO MAYBE SPEAK. BRIEFLY AT IT IS NOT AN EASY TASK THAT YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU IN TERMS OF ADVISING THE GOVERNOR WITH A- POWERFUL BOARD OF PEOPLE WHO COME WITH THE DESIRE TO SERVE AND TO BE ON THIS BOARD- SO MAYBE YOU COULD SPEAK A LITTLE% BIT ABOUT. HOW YOU WOULD SEEK TO WORK WITH US AS THE LEGISLATURE. IN YOUR- YEAH YOU THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION- BECAUSE I THINK IT'S REAL IMPORTANT- IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO AND MAINTAIN COMMUNICATION WITHIN THE M. THEY ADMINISTRATION- IN TERMS OF WORKING WITH- YEAH MY FORMER COLLEAGUE AT THE PC- AS YOU KNOW AS SENATOR BASEMENT YOU KNOW THEY HAVE- AS A UTILITIES ARE GOING TO BE DEPLOYING SOME OF THIS INFRASTRUCTURE WE SEE- THAT WILL BE COMING IN THE FUTURE SAID BEING IN COMMUNICATION WITH THEM BEING IN COMMUNICATION WITH THE ENERGY COMMISSION- WHICH IS DOING. A LOT OF WORK THERE'S SO MANY OTHER AGENCIES THAT ARE IMPORTANT FOR CARP TO COMMUNICATE WITH AND JOE I WILL CONTINUE TO BUILD ON THOSE EXISTING RELATIONSHIPS WHICH BRINGS ME TO THE LEGISLATURE WHERE- THERE ARE AT I DO HAVE SOME EXISTING RELATIONSHIPS BUT I NEED TO BUILD A NEED TO BUILD MORE AND I THINK IT DOES- THOSE OPPORTUNITIES JUST SIT DOWN AND HAVE DISCUSSIONS THAT ARE REALLY- AT THE KEY Q. TWO. GETTING WORK- I WHERE- THE END MEMBERS ARE COMING FROM AND THEY CONCERNS THAT THEY HAVE IN THEIR DISTRICT BE WELL TED BE OPEN AND SAID AND HAVE THE COVERAGE- AND- I AM AM REALLY LOOKING FOR TO- GETTING THAT WORKED- UNDERSTAND THE- THAT ISSUES.

I HAVE DEDICATED MY LIFE TO LOCAL AND REGIONAL GOVERNMENTS AS A COMMUNITY ORGANIZER ATTORNEY PLANNING COMMISSION- BELMONT COUNCILWOMAN. AND BAY AREA AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT DIRECTOR. FROM THESE EXPERIENCES I'VE GAINED AN APPRECIATION FOR BOTH GRASSROOTS ORGANIZING AND GOVERNANCE AS A MEANS TO EFFECT CHANGE THROUGH BALANCED INFORM PUBLIC POLICY. MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE IMPORTANCE OF CLEAN AIR BEGAN AS A CHILD WHERE I WOULD SPEND SUMMERS WITH MY GRANDPARENTS IN GARY AND EAST CHICAGO INDIANA NEXT TO THE STILL MALES. I KNEW WE WERE CLOSE TO GRANDMOTHERS ONCE I ROLLED MY WINDOW DOWN AND COULD SMELL AIR POLLUTION. I ASSOCIATE IN MY GRANDPARENTS HOME WITH THE OWNERS OF THOSE STILL MALES. I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND AT THE TIME WHY WE PLAYED INSIDE AUSTIN AND FRIENDS IN THE COMMUNITY HAD ASTHMA. TODAY THESE AREAS ARE SUPERFUND SITES. JUXTAPOSED I WAS RAISED IN ROCKWALL TEXAS A SMALL TOWN OUTSIDE DALLAS ON THE EDGE OF TEXAS FARMING AND WILL COUNTRY. LIVING IN ROCKWALL GAVE ME INSIGHT TO ISSUES THAT FACE RURAL AREAS OF THE STATE. TODAY I'M IN A COMMUNITY THAT HAS A SIMILAR SMALL TOWN FEEL IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BAY AREA FINANCE LEFT. THAT WE NEED TO DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY IN THE COMING YEARS WITH RESPECT TO HOUSING AND TRANSPORTATION IS GOING TO MEET THE HOUSING NEEDS AND THE CLIMATE GOALS. THESE EXPERIENCES HAVE INFORMED MY INTEREST AND PASSION FOR PROTECTING HIGHLY IMPACTED COMMUNITIES OFTEN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES COMMUNITIES OF COLOR COLOR WITH LITTLE. FINANCIAL SECURITY.

TO ITS PROMISE. THE CHALLENGE WE HAVE IN THE SOUTH COAST IS THE ATTAINMENT OF OUR- NATIONAL AND STATE. ENTERS THE SHIFT NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT WE HAVE THE COMING UP IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR OR OZONE SMOG. AND IT HAS TO BE AT ALL HANDS ON DECK FIVE PRIORITY. MOBILE SOURCES. MANY CASES FEDERAL SOURCES LIKE WERE STATE SOURCES LIKE THE TRUCKS SHIPS AND LOCOMOTIVES ARE A KEY PART OF THE ISSUE THAT WE HAVE IN THE SOUTH COAST- WORKING WITH CARD. IT'S GOING TO BE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT WITH U. S. EPA'S CAN BE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT I'M SORRY TRANSITION EXCUSE ACKNOWLEDGE HE EXCUSE ME EXCUSE ME I WAS WONDERING IF I COULD INTERRUPT YOU TO HAVE OUR VICE CHAIR JUST CONNECT WIT- OUR STENOGRAPHER BECAUSE I SAW THAT SHE WAS MAKING FACES AND WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT SHE WAS- ABLE TO TRANSCRIBE YEAH I DIDN'T SEE THAT ON.

IN ANY EVENT WE HAVE TO TRANSITION THESE DIESEL TECHNOLOGIES MOSTLY IN THE MOBILE SOURCE SECTOR TO CLEANER TECHNOLOGIES CARBON IS AN EXTREMELY CRITICAL PARTNER IN THIS. UPCOMING IS CARBS MOBILE SOURCE STRATEGY PART OF THAT IS GOING TO BE EXAMINING APPROACHES TO ADDRESS OUR OZONE AND MOBILE SOURCE ISSUES OF COURSE IN THE SOUTH COAST AND A KEY PART OF THIS ALSO IS THE INCENTIVE DOLLARS. WE ARE GOING TO NEED TO INCENTIVIZE INDUSTRY PARTICULARLY SOME OF THE SMALL BUSINESSES SMALL TRUCKERS FOR EXAMPLE YOU SHIFT TO THE INTERTECHNOLOGY ISN'T CAR. WHETHER IT'S A CAR MORE PROGRAM VOLKSWAGEN PROGRAM THERE'S- A LOT OF MONEY POTENTIALLY IN THE STATE BUDGET THAT IS BEING NEGOTIATED NOW FOR THE INCENTIVES. WORKING BETWEEN SOUTH COAST AND CARP ON THOSE ISSUES IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. GREAT THANK YOU- AND I DO AGREE THOSE INCENTIVE DOLLARS ARE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AND IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT THAT THEY GET DISTRIBUTED IN A WAY- THAT IS EQUITABLE AND FAIR- ACROSS ALL PORTIONS OF THE STATE SO THAT EVERYONE FEELS LIKE THEY ARE INVESTING IN. THIS NEW KIND OF ECONOMY- AND INFRASTRUCTURE- THAT WE HAVE DECIDED THAT WE WANT TO BECOME MORE RELIANT ON- YOU KNOW DOCTOR BONUS I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU I THINK IN SOME OF YOUR RESPONSES YOU SAID THAT YOU WERE.

EXCITED ABOUT- HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH- CHAIR RANDOLPH I NOW CONFIRMED AND- THE THREE- OTHER APPOINTEES STATE YOU'RE HEARING BECAUSE- DUBBED I HAVE BEEN WORKING THE ENTIRE TIME THAT I'VE BEEN ON THE BOARD TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CONSIDER ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AND I REGULATORY ACTIONS. AND I FEEL LIKE WE MADE PROGRESS AND I WANT TO THANK THE LEGISLATURE FOR PASSING AB SIX ONE SEVEN BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY MADE IT POSSIBLE. FOR CARVE TO FOCUS LIKE AGE IT ALWAYS SHOULD HAVE ON ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE- IT'S MADE U WALK THE WALK. AS OPPOSED TO JUST YOU KNOW TALK ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE BECAUSE WE NOW HAVE TO WORK WITH. WE HAVE TO PARTNER WITH COMMUNITIES COMMUNITIES LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR LIKE THE SOME OF THE COMMUNITIES YOU REPRESENT. AND THAT IT'S PRETTY CLEAR TO ME THAT- THE GOVERNOR IN APPOINTING CHAIR RANDOLPH- MIS HEARD. DR JEKYLL WARNER AND- MR KRAKOFF AS WELL AS- REAPPOINTING ME THAT. HE'S INTERESTED IN SEEING. THE BOARD- FOCUS ON ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE- TO MAKE SURE THAT- COMMUNITIES WITH DISPROPORTIONATE BURDEN OF AIR POLLUTION THAT AFFECTS THEIR HEALTH- THE TECH GETS RE DRESSED AS BEST WE CAN. SB SIX ONE SEVEN IS GONNA SOLVE EVERYTHING AS I KNOW YOU KNOW BUT IT'S A STEP FORWARD IN A PORTENT STEP FORWARD I REALLY WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT BE SUCCESSFUL YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE CONSIDERED A MODEL FOR THE REST OF THE COUNTRY AND THE WORLD IN TERMS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. MITIGATION POLICY BUT IF WE CAN MAKE A BE SIX ONE SEVEN WORK WE WILL BE A LEADER IN. IMPLEMENTING A LEGISLATIVE MANDATE THAT DIRECTS THE AGENCY TO. DEAL WITH ENVIRONMENTAL INJUSTICE SO THAT'S WHY I'M REINVIGORATED I REALLY FEEL THAT- WHERE. THE GOVERNOR AND HOPEFULLY THE LEGISLATURE WANTS US TO GO IS IN MY WHEEL HOUSE- AND I REALLY. LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE- CURRENT BOARD MEMBERS ALREADY APPOINTED- AND THEN. HOPEFULLY OF MY FELLOW. NEW APPOINTEES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THEN I JUST HAVE ONE LAST QUESTION VICE CHAIR REALLY DIRECTED TO- THESE AMAZING WOMEN MISS HURT AND DOCTOR OF PAYCHECK- WEREN'T LEARNER- WHO BOTH ACTUALLY TALKED ABOUT. YOUR LIVED EXPERIENCES- AND COMING FROM PARTICULAR COMMUNITIES- AND USING THAT LANDS AT TO HELP INFORM ALL OF THE WORK THAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING- AND PROBABLY WILL HELP INFORM YOUR WORK AS A BOARD MEMBER. ON CAR. YOU KNOW- THERE WERE SOME ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE GROUPS AND OTHERS WHO PUBLICLY RESIGNED THEIR APPOINTMENTS- TO SHOW THEIR DISPLEASURE. WITH THE LACK OF ATTENTION THAT THE PAST A OR B. I. HAU TO- COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE COMMUNITIES LIKE THE THIRTY S. SENATE DISTRICT- AND YET WE KNOW THAT WE CANNOT BLOCK IT YOU KNOW ISSUES RIGHT. THE BLACK EMISSIONS- ED METHANE- YOU KNOW BUILDING TOXICITY- A LACK OF CLEAN WATER- A LACK OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE YOU KNOW THOSE THINGS IMPACT RURAL COMMUNITIES THEY ALSO IMPACT URBAN COMMUNITIES PROBABLY IN DIFFERENT WAYS. SO WANTED TO KNOW IF THE TWO OF YOU ALL COULD JUST SORT OF SHARE OF THE KINDS OF ASSURANCES YOU CAN GIVE THIS COMMITTEE AND THE SENATE- THAT IF CONFIRMED YOU AND YOUR FELLOW BOARD MEMBERS AND YOU ALL MAYBE LEADING THEM. IN IN IN SOME WAYS- WILL BE RESPONSIVE TO OF THE LEGISLATURE IN DRIVE POLICY OUTCOMES AFTER ALL OF CALIFORNIANS INCLUDING COMMUNITIES OF COLOR- TO HELP DRIVE THOSE DISCUSSIONS AND POLICIES RATHER THAN KIND OF TO DEFER TO STAFF BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT SOMETIMES THAT HAPPENS- AND- BUT YOUR VOICE IS WILL BE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. I'M AND I THINK THEY WILL BE IMPORTANT IN LEADING- DISCUSSIONS AROUND POLICY- AND IN IN FIGURING OUT WAYS TO PARTNER WITH THE LEGISLATURE SO WOULD LOVE TO HEAR ABOUT YOUR RESPONSE TO THAT. LET ME OF MISS HER TO FEW WOULD GO FIRST I THOUGHT THE DOCTOR PACHECO WARNER YOU ARE MUTE SO- WE'LL GO WITH OF HIS HURT FIRST AND THEN. YOU CAN FOLLOW. S. THANK YOU SAID- FOR THAT QUESTION AND JOHN. IT'S GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT FOR US TO LIST ALL VOICES AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU I WAS DISAPPOINTED TO HEAR THAT SOME PEOPLE DID RESIDENTS OF. RESIGNED FROM THE PROCESS ESPECIALLY AS- A FORMER MAYOR AND CURRENT COUNCIL MEMBER YOU WANT EVERYBODY TO BE INVESTED IN THE PROCESS AND FEEL LIKE THEIR INPUT. IS MAKING A DIFFERENCE OUR TIME IS VERY VALUABLE AND I JUST WANTED TO- THE LEGISLATURE AND THE PEOPLE AND ALL THESE DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES TO UNDERSTAND THAT. I'M OPEN TO ALL THE POLICIES AND IDEAS AND THOUGHTS AND WANTING TO DO WHAT'S BEST FOR CALIFORNIA MEANS THE INTEGRATION OF ALL THE STOCKS IT MEANS. EVERYONE CITY YEAH TO TABLE AND EXPRESSING WHAT THEY THINK IS GOOD FOR THE COMMUNITIES AND ALSO WHAT'S GOOD FOR THE OUTCOME- OF. THE ENTIRE OF CALIFORNIA AND SO I CITY MY LIVED EXPERIENCES ARE IMPORTANT- BECAUSE I WANT TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK THE LANGUAGE OF ALL COMMUNITIES- AND I THINK THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SOMETHING. AND THAT MAY HAVE BEEN MISSING BEFORE AND SOMETHING THAT I WISH TO BRING- AS I SAID AS A BOARD MEMBER- EIGHT WE'VE GOT A LOT OF. GOALS THAT WE NEED TO REACH AND WE CAN'T DO IT ON OUR OWN WE HAVE MANY DIFFERENT SISTER. AGENCIES THAT NEED TO SPEAK TOGETHER WE HAVE MANY DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES SOME IMPACTED GREATER THAN OTHERS. BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY WE ARE CALIFORNIA AND WE HAVE TO. MOVE TOGETHER AND LISTEN AND LEARN AND THEN IMPLEMENT- AND EMPLOY- EVERYONE'S GREAT THOUGHTS- AT THE END OF THE DAY TO THE TABLE- SO AGAIN I I'M TRULY COMMITTED. TO PROMOTE THOSE VOICES. VOICES FOCUSED ON HELPS HAVE VOICES ARE FOCUSED ON ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS- SO THAT WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE FOR CALIFORNIA AND TO CONTINUE REDUCING. EMISSIONS THAT AREN'T SO. THANK YOU DR PROJECT WARNER OUGHT TO GO NEXT. YEAH I THINK THEY- JUST AS FOR ME I'M THINKING ABOUT HOW MY EXPERIENCE AND MY IDENTITY- FRIENDS A LOT OF MY WORK I ALSO KNOW THEY- THE VOICE OF THEM IN MY MENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITY IS SO IMPORTANT TO THE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE HAVE BECAUSE THEY DO TALK TO RESIDENTS THAT ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED. BY OUR RULE MAKING OR LACK OF WILL MAKE IN IN SOME AREAS AND I THINK FOR ME I'M COMING FROM A PUBLIC HEALTH PERSPECTIVE COMING FROM HEALTH EQUITY- PERSPECTIVE I ALWAYS THINK ABOUT NEEDING TO BE AS CLEAR AS OPEN AND AS- I. CLEAR AS POSSIBLE WHEN IT COMES TO IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT WHO REALLY NEEDS TO BE AT THE TABLE HOW DO WE THINK ABOUT THE VOICES THAT NEED TO- HAVE AND REALLY HOW WILL THE DECISION MAKING WORK AND I THINK THAT. WHEN IT CAME TO WHEN I READ THE LETTERS OF THOSE THAT I HAD RESIGNED FROM. THAT COMMITTEE- WHAT I REALLY TOOK FROM THAT IS- HOW CAN WE DO THINGS BETTER FROM THE GET GO SO THAT. EXPECTATIONS ARE RIGHT SO THAT WE'RE CLEAR ON WHAT WE'RE ASKING- PEOPLE- THAT ARE DONATED TIME TO DO AND THEN ALSO HOW CAN I AS A BOARD MEMBER REALLY ELEVATE THOSE VOICES AND THOSE CONCERNS AS WELL- TO THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS. I DO THINK ABOUT- EVEN NOW AS I AM. IN MY IN MY ROLE ALREADY AS FOR NUMBER AND- IN THE SELECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ADVISORY COMMITTEE FAR SCOPING PLAN- REALLY POINTING OUT TO STAFF AND THINGS THAT THEY'VE ACTUALLY TAKEN ARE TAKING ACTION ON IN TERMS OF INCREASING- CERTAIN VOICES AT THE TABLE BECAUSE AGAIN. I IF I HEAR THAT FOR EXAMPLE THERE IS NOT ENOUGH AFRICAN AMERICAN REPRESENTATION IN OUR DECISION MAKING PROCESS I DON'T SEE ENOUGH AFRICAN AMERICAN REPRESENTATION WHEN IT COMES TO OUR ADVISORY COMMITTEE I'M GOING TO SAY SOMETHING. BECAUSE IT'S MY RESPONSIBILITY FOR MY HEALTH EQUITY PERSPECTIVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE RIGHT DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED VOICES MAKE IT TO THE TABLE AND- FOR ME TO HELP ELEVATE. GREAT THANK YOU SO MUCH I ACTS WANT TO POWER- TO- THE HONORABLE HURT BECAUSE I DID NOT ADDRESS MY QUESTION TO YOU USING YOUR TITLE. AND I.

THANK YOU MADAM VICE CHAIR THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE TODAY AND TAKING OUR QUESTIONS AND I DO HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS TO- TO ASK RIGHT I FIRST WANT TO START IF AT ALL POSSIBLE- AND I DON'T PARTICULARLY HAVE A PREFERENCE OF WHO RESPONDS TO THIS QUESTION. I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM BOTH- THE HONORABLE HURT AND THEN ALSO THE ON A PARTICULAR WARNER- OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE OF THE EXPERIENCES THE LIVED EXPERIENCES THAT THEY HAVE AND I DO APPRECIATE THAT- THE ENVELOPE AND CHECK A WARNER IS FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY. I DO APPRECIATE THAT- SHE GREW UP IN THE VALLEY SHE LIVES IN THE VALLEY AND SHE UNDERSTANDS THE IMPACTS OF AGRICULTURE- AND OIL IN THE VALLEY. I ALSO WANT TO COMPLIMENT- SO YOUR BEST FRIEND AND WE WILL KEEP THE PEDAL IN THE END ONLY CHILL AFN- YOU LAUNCH THE AND THE- INTO MY MOTHER HE SAID HE COULD NO I JUST WANT TO BE BOTH THE AUTO BONTA GILAD TODAY BEEN A TOTAL AND THEN IF I SAID THAT RATE WHICH I MAY HAVE YOU MAY NOT HAVE IT SAYS THAT- YOUR MOM TOLD YOU ONE TIME- ESPECIALLY GO WONDER THAT YOU'RE NOT A GOLD COIN.

AND YOU KNOW THAT'S WHAT I APPRECIATE ABOUT YOU VERY MUCH THIS IS THE SECOND TIME I'VE HAD YOU BEFORE ME AND- I KNOW THAT WE SPENT TIME IN MY OFFICE ON SEVERAL QUESTIONS THAT I HAD- AND I APPRECIATE IT I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT NOT EVERYBODY'S GOING TO LIKE WHAT YOU DO TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN STILL PRODUCE FOOD IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY FOR CONSTITUENTS ACROSS THE STATE. AND I APPRECIATE THAT NOT EVERYBODY'S GOING TO LIKE THE FACT THAT AND OTHER THINGS THAT ARE THAT ADVERSELY AFFECT OR THAT MAKE FARMERS OR GROWERS RANCHERS DO ADDITIONAL THINGS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE CLEANER AIR QUALITY- AND IT AND I APPRECIATE THAT SO WHICH MAKES ME THINK THAT YOU ARE JUST GOING TO BE A WONDERFUL WELL BALANCED- PERSON ON THIS BOARD WITH NO ACTIVIST BACKGROUND- SO I DO WANT TO APPRECIATE THAT.

YEAH CAN YOU TELL ME HOW YOU THINK THAT THAT BRINGING BALANCE TO THAT SITUATION IS GOING TO HELP ALL SIDES OF THE ECONOMY ESPECIALLY IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. THANK YOU. I THINK THEY- WHEN WE THINK ABOUT- THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE THAT KEEPS THE CENTRAL VALLEY AT NINETEEN THAT- WHEN IT COMES TO ITS AIR QUALITY GOALS IT IS MOBILE SOURCE POLLUTION AND SO FOR ME GETTING TO THAT PLACE OF NOT ONLY A TEAM MATCH REALLY SEEN THE BENEFIT FOR ALL OF LAST AND LIVING IN THE VALLEY TAPPED IN YOUR AIR DOES INCLUDE TACKLING THE MOBILE SOURCE POLLUTION. ARE PART OF THAT EQUATION I DO UNDERSTAND THAT IN TERMS OF OUR ECONOMY- EIGHT THE OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION IS VERY IMPORTANT AND- NOT ONLY- AS AN INDUSTRY BUT I THINK ABOUT THE PEOPLE- AND I KNOW THAT THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE VERY SMALL- OF THAT BUSINESS OWNERS THAT ARE HEAVILY IMPACTED BY THE DECISIONS MAKE THE TRANSITION TO ZERO EMISSIONS- WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO IS REALLY HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT. WHAT IS TRANSITION LOOK LIKE AND- AND HOW DO WE HOW DO WE FRAME IT IN A WAY THAT WE'RE ALSO THINKING ABOUT HOW WE NOT ONLY TRANSITION BACK ON PART OF OUR ECONOMY BUT ALSO WITH THE RECOGNITION.

THANK YOU SENATOR FORD CAN'T QUESTION I SHOULD SAY THAT I WAS A HIGH SPEED RAIL ADVOCATE MANY MANY YEARS AGO. WHEN I FIRST STARTED- AND THERE'S BEEN MUCH CHANGE. SINCE THEN AS AS IT RELATES TO- HOW THAT'S EVOLVED IN EVEN IN MY OWN COMMUNITY. WHERE THE LOCATION IS OF HIGH SPEED RAIL AND HOW THAT INTERACTION EFFECTS. AS IT RELATES- JUNTS TO THE COMMUNITIES. SO WHAT I AM AND WHAT I CAN SAY IS THAT- I RESPECT- MASS TRANSPORTATION AND ITS IMPORTANCE. AS SOMEONE HAD SPIES SAID EARLIER. TODAY BUT TRANSPORTATION IS ONE OF OUR LARGEST- EMISSION REDUCTIONS BASIS WE NEED TO OUR FAX. AND YOU KNOW THERE IS A SLIGHT TENSION WITH. VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED AS WELL AS GETTING PEOPLE ON PUBLIC TRANSIT. AND SO- I AM LOOKING FOR THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY AND TRYING TO FIND AND FIGURE OUT WAYS THAT WE CAN REDUCE PEOPLE DRIVING- BY THEMSELVES AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. AND TRYING TO USE. NOT ONLY HIGH SPEED RAIL- BUT ALSO IN OUR- AREA CALTRAIN- THEY WERE GOING TO ELECTRIFY- AND SO IT'S INVESTMENTS I SEATED FOR THE FUTURE AND- THEY'RE NOT. EASY- IT'S NOT AS SOME. OUT SAY THAT MY BUT I BUT I WILL SAY HIGH SPEED RAIL IS ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE- MOBILE SOURCES THAT GETTING TO- MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE- IN LARGER. GROUPS SO THAT WE CAN REDUCE EMISSIONS AND I'M FOLLOWING IT CLOSELY- AND I HAVE MY EYES TO FIGURING OUT- JUST EXACTLY HOW IMPORTANT IT IS. FOR CALIFORNIA AND IT IT WILL BE IMPORTANT FOR ME TO WATCH HOW IT ALSO IMPACTS THE COMMUNITIES FOR WHAT SHE GOES THROUGH. SO IT I APPRECIATE THAT BUT AGAIN WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT LIVED EXPERIENCES I MEAN I DON'T THINK ANYBODY EXCEPT FOR MR TRISH WARNER'S GROWN UP IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. NO ONE IS GOING TO BRING KERN- THIS IS TAKE RIDGECREST IN TWO AND A HALF HOURS EAST OF BAKERSFIELD WHICH IS A CENTRAL PART OF IT THAT DISTRICT. AND THERE'S NO RAIL THAT GOES FROM RIDGECREST BAKERSFIELD. IT'S A TWO AND A HALF HOUR DRIVE AND- IF YOU ARE. SEVERELY INJURED IN THE EAST PART OF THE COMMUNITY THE CLOSEST HOSPITAL I GUESS RICHEST ME TO PATCH BE BUT BE GOING OVER MOUNTAIN PASSES BUT TO GET TO BAKERSFIELD. M. THEY STABILIZE YOU AND THEN TRANSPORTED BY AMBULANCE OR- STABILIZE YOU ENOUGH TO GET YOU IN A PERSONAL CAR AND THEN THEY LET YOU TRY TO BAKERSFIELD FOR TREATMENT. I JUST THINK THAT AND YOU KNOW I UNDERSTAND THAT PEOPLE WANT TO GO FROM LOS ANGELES TO SAN FRANCISCO OR LOS ANGELES PRESS TO SACRAMENTO. BUT I JUST DON'T SEE HOW YOU GET IN OUR COMMUNITY M. F. TULARE- AND KERN FRESNO I THINK COULD MANAGE. BUT M. THE MOUNTAIN COMMUNITIES DEFINITELY CAN AND I JUST THINK THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE CONSIDERATION FOR COMMUNITIES THAT- ARE GOING TO DRIVE I MEAN THEY'RE GOING TO DRIVE LIKE I SAID YOU KNOW I HAVE A COLLEAGUE THAT YOU KNOW REPRESENTS TWENTY SIX BLOCKS OF THE- YOU KNOW SAVE A LOS ANGELES YOU CAN WALK THAT DISTRICT. AS A MATTER OF FACT WHEN I WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY THE PERSON WHO REPRESENT THAT DISTRICT I WAS IN A FIGHT WITH ONE OF MY KIDS I FIVE KIDS- MIGHT. DAUGHTER HAD WRECKED HER CAR. AND I'M ON THE PHONE BECAUSE I TOOK THE TRAIN AT. AND SHE'S THE- THE- I TO THE TRAIN THE REGULAR TRAIN OBVIOUSLY- ANYWAYS- SO I'M ARGUING WITH HER AND I'M LIKE DON'T YOU TOUCH MY CAR AND SHE'S WRECKED HER CAR SHE'S NOT DRIVING MY CAR. IN SO IDEA IT WAS ON THE PHONE ARGUE WITH HER AND THAT COLLEAGUE OF MINE IN THE ASSEMBLY GOES I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU HAVE A TWO CAR FAMILY. AND I THOUGHT FOR A SECOND I'M LIKE. GOSH WE'RE A SEVEN CAR FAMILY. FIVE KIDS ME MY HUSBAND PLUS WE HAVE A RANCH TRUCK THAT WE TAKE TO THE RANCH. IN AND THE COMMENT THAT SHE REPLIED BACK TO ME IS LIKE YOUR FAMILY IS THE TOTAL BECAUSE OF GLOBAL WARMING. AND I JUST THOUGHT WELL YOU HAVE NO IDEA I THE KID THAT TRIES TO FROM BAKERSFIELD FRESNO STATE TO GO TO SCHOOL AND GET AN EDUCATION. I HAVE A DAUGHTER THAT TRIES TO BAKERSFIELD TO GO BE A NURSE TO HELP PEOPLE. AND GET WELL AND BE BETTER. I HAVE ANOTHER DAUGHTER THAT DRIVES TO- TAFT TO GET HER OLDER STANDARDS CALLED IMAGING ENGINEER NOW. AND CERTIFICATE OR WHATEVER SO THAT SHE CAN DO ALTER SOUNDS AND MY HUSBAND GOES TO WORK AND I GO TO WORK AND THERE'S NO WAY WE COULD SHARE. A COUPLE OF VEHICLES. AND SO I JUST THINK THAT THE LIVED EXPERIENCES THAT WE ALL HAVE HAVE IN WILL MAKE DECISIONS IN THIS BUILDING BASED ON OUR LIFE EXPERIENCE I GET THAT. I GET THAT NO ONE KNOWS HOW WE LIVE- UNTIL THEY EXPERIENCE IT AND YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW HOW MY COLLEAGUE IN. YOU KNOW LOS ANGELES HERE THIS IT'S NEXT TO ME. WHAT HER LIFESTYLE IS BUT I KNOW IT'S DIFFERENT THAN MINE. BUT I THINK THAT WE NEED TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION ALL OF OUR CONSTITUENTS IN THOSE LIFE EXPERIENCES WHERE THEY ARE. AND I WOULD JUST LIKE SOME. A LITTLE CONSIDERATION I GUESS FOR THE VALLEY. IN EVERYTHING THAT WE HAVE TO OFFER THIS STATE- AGAIN I KNOW THAT YOU GUYS ARE SO ARE- YOU HAVE A SEVERE IMPACT ON THE AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY. WHERE THE SECOND TOP PRODUCING FRESNO IS THE FIRST. CURRENTS A SECOND A TWITTER IS A THIRD FOOD PRODUCING COUNTY IN THE WORLD. I BELIEVE WE PRODUCE OVER A HUNDRED AND NINETY NINE COMMODITIES WHERE WE PRODUCE THE WORLD. AND YOU KNOW PUTTING THE CENTRAL VALLEY AT A BUSINESS FROM GROWING FOOD NOT ONLY AFFECTS THE FOOD SUPPLY HERE IN CALIFORNIA. BUT THE FOOD SUPPLY FOR THE WORLD AND THAT IS NOT AN UNDERSTATEMENT. THE GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS BLESSED. TO GOVERNOR STATE WITH THE TOP SIX PRODUCING. FOOD COUNTIES IN THE ENTIRE WORLD SALINAS VALLEY WHERE THEY GROW THE LETTUCE AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO IT'S NOT JUST A CENTRAL VALLEY. AND I JUST THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME TYPE OF CONSIDERATION FOR THESE COMMUNITIES. THAT ARE TRYING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO AND WE ARE POLITICALLY DIFFERENT. M. BUT WE ARE TRYING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO HELP MEET THE CLIMATE GOALS THAT ARE SET FORTH. LIKE I SAID EARLIER 51% OF THE SOLAR. THAT FUELS CALIFORNIA COMES FROM KERN COUNTY. AND THOSE MEGA SOLAR WHAT PLANTS ARE IN KERN COUNTY AND WE GET NO BENEFIT. THE ENERGY GOES NORTH AND GO SOUTH AND WE DON'T GET TAX REVENUE. M. AND IT'S VERY FRUSTRATING. SO I JUST AM LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY HE WILL JUST TAKE AN HONEST LOOK LIKE. LIKE MISS WATER I'D PICK A WINNER I DON'T I DON'T THINK SHE'LL AGREE WITH US 1100% OF THE TIME SHE MAY NOT EVEN AGREE WITH US 50% OF THE TIME. BUT SHE'S WILLING. TO LOOK AT THIS SIDE JUST LIKE I'M SURE SHE'S WILLING TO LOOK AT LOS ANGELES ASIDE. AND THAT'S ALL I'M ASKING FOR IS SOMEBODY WHO'S GONNA LOOK AT THINGS. FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE SPECTRUM AND NOT BE AN ACTIVIST ON THE BOARD NOT THAT YOU ARE I DON'T MEAN IT LIKE THAT I'M JUST LOOKING THAT'S THE BOARD MEMBER I'M LOOKING FOR. AND SO- I APPRECIATE YOU GIVING ME THAT INFORMATION THAT- YOU APPRECIATE MASS PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION. BUT I ALSO WANT YOU TO APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT IT ALWAYS DOESN'T WORK IN EVERY AREA OF THE STATE. AND I'M I'M SMILING. I KNOW YOU CAN'T SEE THE- I AGREE WITH YOU AND I THINK JUST TO. MAYBE MAKE ONE MORE COMMENT TO THIS POINT NO ONE SIZE FITS ALL DOESN'T WORK- AND SO I APPRECIATE THAT CENTRAL VALLEY IS MUCH DIFFERENT THAN THE BAY AREA AND- AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I'M LEARNING AND LISTENING AND UNDERSTANDING EVERYTHING THAT YOU'RE SAYING RIGHT NOW AND WILL INTEGRATE THAT INTO MY DECISIONS AS IT RELATES TO ALL OF CALIFORNIA- SO I HEAR YOU HI I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT AND I WILL TAKE THOSE THINGS INTO CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU MA'AM N. F. I HAVE TO APPLAUD THE GOVERNOR I MEAN GO GOVERNOR GAVIN NEWSOM I MEAN THE MAKE UP OF THIS BOARD WITH WOMEN IS- VERY. IT'S PRETTY AWESOME SO I'M A SO THANK YOU FOR THAT.

IT'S A GOAL THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS TO YOU KNOW GO 21100% RECYCLING ZERO LANDFILL- BUT THIS INDUSTRY. THE IS I MEAN I THINK.

AND IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO- TO FUNCTION IN THE STATE EVEN THAT WE DESPERATELY NEED THEM TOO SO. I APPRECIATE THAT- RESPONSE I JUST WANTED TO KNOW WHERE YOU KIND OF WERE ON THAT I WASN'T SURE ABOUT THE CONNECTION BUT I KNEW YOU WERE. SOMEHOW CONNECTED SO THANK YOU SIR I THINK YOU ALSO BRING A WELL BALANCED APPROACH. AND TO PASS THE BOARD.

WE'RE REALLY HAVING A LOT OF FUN AND THE HEARING TODAY HEY I HAD A BETTER ACCENT. HEY I HAVE A WEST BAKERSFIELD BACKS SO THAT'S THE ISSUE. I THINK THE THAT MY COLLEAGUES HAVE DONEA GREAT JOB OF DRAWING OUT THIS AND ASKING ACTUALLY MANY OF THE THINGS I WAS GOING TO SO MAYBE I'LL DO SOMETHING UNUSUAL WHICH IS THAT. UNMATCHED WITH THE FOR MEMBERS AND WE HAVE SINCE IN THE BRIEF TIME I'VE BEEN ON THE RULES COMMITTEE WE'VE ALREADY HAD CONFIRMATION HEARINGS FOR TO VIEW. OF FOR THE LOCAL AIRPORT THE HAND UP ANDHAD RIGOROUS DISCUSSIONS AND QUESTIONS WHEN THAT HAPPENED AND SO. WHAT ME JUST SAY THAT. WE'RE VERY SATISFIED WITH THE DISCUSSION THAT HAPPENED VERY SATISFIED WITH THE DISCUSSION THAT WE HAD. AND I THINK WITH EACH OF YOU WHEN N. ACTUALLY. MISTER KRAKOFF WAS- A MEMBER OF THE MINING AND GEOLOGY BOARD WHEN I WAS SECRETARY FOR NATURAL RESOURCES AND I THINK HE WAS A LEADER IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL PART OF THE STATE BAR. R. AS WELL AND- AND HE INDICATED IN THE DISCUSSION THAT HE REPRESENTED ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE GROUPS HIS FELLOW AS WELL AS THE TRADE ASSOCIATIONS AND OTHER SICK CAME UP PREVIOUSLY IN THE HEARING. AND I THINK MS BUT CHECK OR WARNER. ARE REALLY TALK MEANINGFULLY ABOUT A KID THAT HAS ASTHMA AND RUN BACKGROUND TO GROWING WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH EVERYBODY THAT I THINK WAS RECOGNIZED. BY CENTER GROVE. A N. R. I THINK THE MAY. OR SAID THAT- A MEMBER BOMBINGS DONE. AND HIS COMMITMENT TO A. B. SIX SEVENTEEN AT AND WORKING ON THAT THE QUALIFIES HIM. AND I THINK FOR MEMBER HEARD. HER A DISCUSSION IN THE MEETING WAS REALLY ABOUT PEOPLE'S EVERYDAY LIVES AND REPRESENTING THEM AT THE BORDER AND UNDERSTANDING WHAT THEY DID SO I JUST I'D BE GOOD TO PUT ON THE RECORD THOSE THINGS FROM THE DISCUSSION ACKNOWLEDGED THE ANSWERS TO THE MEMBERS AND SAY. A BARRING SOMETHING BIZARRE IN ANY FURTHER- PUBLIC COMMENT A LOOK FORWARD TO SUPPORT IN ALL FOUR AND OUR CONFIRMATION WHEN WE COME BACK AND VOTE ON THEM AFTER WE TAKE THE RECESS HERE SO THANK YOU MADAM VICE CHAIR AND THANKS TO ALL FOR.

THANK YOU SENATOR LAYERED AND YOU WOULD THINK THERE'S NOTHING LEFT TO ASK AND THEN NGUYEN APPROACH HIM SINCE IN THIS POSITION SHE SAYS WELL EVERYTHING'S BEEN ASKED BUT I DO HAVE ONE. QUICK QUESTION TO ASK. THE DOCTOR BONUS THEN YOU KNOW THAT'S THE WAY WITH. AUTHORITY TO PRONOUNCE YOUR NAME THEN I HEARD THEM SAY MOMS LIKE AUTO WELL WE BETTER DO IT RIGHT. WOULD YOU SERVE THE LONGEST THAT I JUST HAVE A QUESTION AFTER OUR INTERVIEW WITH- THE NEW OTCHERE. REGARDING STRUCK THE WAY IT'S STRUCTURED AND THAT HAS TO DO WITH VODAFONE- PREVIOUS SLIDE I GUESS THERE WAS A CONCERN ABOUT. IT BEING VERY CHAIR CENTERED IN TERMS OF NOT INVOLVING ON TO A GREATER DEGREE BOARD MEMBERS AND NOT FROM OF THE DECISION MAKING OR AT LEAST THE DISCUSSION WITH THE PUBLIC. SO I'M GONNA ASK YOU DOCTOR BOMBS- GIVEN THE COMPLEX NATURE OF THE BOARD ISSUES BEFORE YOU WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON EACH BOARD MEMBER HAVING A STAFF ADVISOR. WHO COULD ASSIST YOU WITH GETTING ANSWERS TO YOUR QUESTIONS PRIOR TO THE MONTHLY MEETINGS UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU PROBABLY GET. A LOT INDIVIDUAL AND PUT. ARE AND THAT MIGHT BE WELL I SHARED OUR THROUGH A COMMITTEE STRUCTURE RATHER VAN NOW OF YOU KNOW BEING ON A BOARD AND- YOU'RE OUT THERE RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE PUBLIC AND THERE'S NOT A LOT OF TIME TO SHARE PERHAPS. OF WHAT YOU LEARNED IN IN WHICH SHE PROCESSED ARE AND I THINK STAFF HELPS HAVING SERVED ON LOCAL GOVERNMENTS I KNOW HONORABLE FOR YOU WOULD KNOW- YOU GET COMMITTEES FOLLOW THAT ARE PARTICIPATORY IN THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS. VERY VERY HELPFUL- WHEN YOU HAVE TO MAKE DIFFICULT DECISIONS. FOR WHAT'S YOUR THOUGHT ON THAT. AND I DON'T WANT TO YOU SIDE WITH SOME NEW CHAIR I. YOU I'M NOT DOING THAT JUST. THOUGHT I WAS SAY THAT I WELL THE NEW CHIU STILL OF WE- FOR THE JURY SO FAR. BECAUSE IT IS VERY INCLUSIVE- AND- I SEND THAT- SHE WANTS US TO BE A TEAM. SHE MADE ME TO- BUT SHE WANTS IN COURT FROM ALL OF THE SHE SAID THAT I THINK- EARLIER IN THIS. AARON AND I FEEL THAT. SO THAT'S PART OF WHAT JOHN. WHEN I RESPONDED TO A SENATOR AT KAMLAGER ABOUT MY FEELING REINVIGORATED X. THE NEW LEADERSHIP THAT CHAIR RANDOLPH BRINGS- I THINK IS GOING TO BE MORE- CAN BY CONSENSUS- I VERY MUCH. I ENJOYED WORKING WITH THE PREVIOUS CHAIR MARY NICHOLS WHO I GREATLY RESPECT AND I THINK SHE DID INCREDIBLE SERVICE FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE NATION IN THE WORLD. BUT BECAUSE SHE WAS SUCH A WELL ESTABLISHED LEADER IN THE FIELD- IT DID TEND TO ARE WE DO TEND TO FALL IN LINE- MAYBE MORE OFTEN THAN NOT- IN TERMS OF HER LEADERSHIP WHICH WAS I THINK USUALLY ON TARGET BUT I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO- YOU KNOW A DIFFERENT. APPROACH THAT I THINK CHAIR RANDALL BRINGS AND- I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE A STAFF ADVISOR- YOU KNOW. I'M AN ACADEMIC. YOU KNOW I HAVEN'T HAD A SECRETARY ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANT REALLY FOR DECADES I THINK- DR JEKYLL WARNER PROBABLY IN A SIMILAR SITUATION- SO- AND AS FAR AS IS SORT OF SUBCOMMITTEES- IT'S ALREADY SORT OF HAPPEN TO SOME EXTENT- WITH SB SIX ONE SEVEN AND ALSO WITH THE RESEARCH- THE OTHER.
