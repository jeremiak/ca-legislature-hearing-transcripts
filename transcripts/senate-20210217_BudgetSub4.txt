TO SOME EXTENT OTHER PROPOSALS IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET WILL CONTINUE TO EXPAND THE SIZE AND RESPONSIBILITY OF NO PR SO. SOME INCREASE IN MINISTRY OF STAFFING IS WARRANTED WE NOTE THE STAFF COMMENTS IN THE AGENDA THAT YOU CONSIDER FUNDING ONLY A PORTION OF THE REQUEST. WE DO NOT HAVE A SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATION ON THIS ITEM BUT WE CAN WORK WITH STAFF AND ADMINISTRATION- TO NARROW DOWN WHICH POSITIONS- HAVE- THE MOST MERIT BASED ON CURRENT ANTICIPATED RECORDS WHICH MAY INCLUDE. ALL OF THEM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THERE ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE STAFF AT FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. CENTER NIELSEN. OF SERVICE ANY OF YOUR- TRANSITION FUNDING DERIVED FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS OF ALL GENERAL FUND FOR THE STATE. WE HAVE POSITIONS ACTUALLY SIR- FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE DO HAVE SOME POSITIONS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NOT OUR ADMINISTRATIVE CAPACITY BUT FOR CERTAIN OF OUR PROGRAMS PARTICULARLY ON CLIMATE RISK AND THE WORK THAT WERE INCREASINGLY DOING WITH FEMA AND- YES ON COMMUNITY RESPONSE IN WILDFIRE AFFECTED COMMUNITIES THAT IS FEMA FUNDED. US SEVERAL THIS POSITION TO BE A FUNDED WE RUN THE MILITARY COUNCIL SEPARATE THOSE POSITIONS ARE FEDERALLY FUNDED THE CASCADE PROGRAM HAS A FEDERALLY FUNDED POSITIONS AND ACTUALLY A SET OF POSITIONS AT A PR ARE FUNDED THROUGH OTHER AGENCIES SO WE HAVE- I GOT A MIX OF. OUR POLICY POSITIONS AND- AND IT IMPLEMENTATION POSITIONS FUNDED THROUGH THE GENERAL FUND THROUGH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THROUGH THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND AND THROUGH OTHER AGENCIES ARE ADMINISTRATIVE POSITIONS WERE ASKING FOR HERE WOULD BE UNDERLYING ALL OF THOSE DIFFERENT PIECES AND SUPPORTING ALL THREE OF THE OVER ONE PROGRAMS THAT THIS WOULD BE TO BE GENERAL FUND. BECAUSE WE WOULD NEED TO BE ON GOING- AND CONSISTENT- AND PART OF THE STATE BUDGET SCOTT DID YOU WANT TO ADD TO THAT. YEAH I WOULD YEAH I WOULD JUST ADD THAT THE ALL THE FEDERALLY FUNDED POSITIONS ARE THROUGH COMPETITIVE GRANT PROCESS THAT WE'VE ENTERED INTO AND ARE LIMITED TERM POSITION SO MOST OF THOSE ARE OUR EIGHTEEN MONTH TO TWO TWO YEAR POSITIONS THAT GO WITH THE EXTENSION OF THOSE GRANTS- AND SO. WILL GO AWAY WHEN THOSE GRANTS ARE COMPLETED- DO YOU HAVE ANY IN. AT SAY THE LAST FIVE YEARS OF HOW MANY. POSITIONS YOU HAVE. LOST BECAUSE OF THE EXTINGUISHING OF THE FUNDING. FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THE CENTRAL CENTER THE FUNDING HAVE YOU LOST MANY POSITIONS. GOT YES WE A AGAIN THEY THEY RUN WITH THE- WITH THE GRANTS WE CAN GET YOU THOSE NUMBERS WE HAVE BEEN PRETTY SUCCESSFUL IN GETTING ADDITIONAL GRANTS- FROM DEPARTMENT DEFENSE AND FEMALE THAT THAT HAVE THEY HAVE EXTENDED SOME OF THOSE POSITIONS OR HAVE YOU KNOW WE BROUGHT ON OTHER PEOPLE YOU KNOW TO FILL THOSE GRANT NEEDS SO- THE NUMBERS MIGHT YOU KNOW FLUCTUATE ONE OR TWO HERE AND THERE YOU KNOW IT'S NOT WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW TENS OF POSITIONS WERE TALKING ABOUT THAT FOUR FIVE SIX POSITIONS TOTAL- BASED ON THAT FOUR FIVE GRANTS THAT WOULD THAT WE MANAGE. A DURING A GIVEN PERIOD- BUT WE CAN GET BACK TO YOU ON ON THOSE NUMBERS IF YOU'D LIKE TO DEFINITELY A- CURIOSITY. EACH YEAR HAVE HAD SOME PRETTY SIGNIFICANT. PEOPLE I GROWTH IN THE LAST FEW YEARS. HAS IT ALL BEEN DRIVEN BY EXECUTIVE ORDERS AND STATUTES OR HAVE THERE BEEN OTHER FACTORS THE NEW INITIATIVES BY THE GOVERNOR FOR EXAMPLE. IN GENERAL IT'S BEEN LEGISLATIVE AS YOU HEARD FOR THE L. L. LEGISLATIVE AND EXECUTIVE ORDER SO- I NUMBER OF PIECES OF THE GROWTH YOU'LL SEE A BIG PIECE OF GROWTH FROM OUR AYE INTEGRATION OF THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL WHICH WAS NOT ORIGINALLY HOUSED AT OPR. NOW IT IS- I HE SAID THAT THAT COUNCIL HAS GROWN- YES IT IT RUNS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY AND LOUISE BATS WORK EXACTLY DIRECTORS HERE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF GRANT MONEY RUN FOR THAT PROGRAM THAT'S MOSTLY FUNDED THROUGH THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND- AND SAID THAT PROGRAM HAS ABSOLUTELY GROWN YOU'VE ALSO SEEN- GROWTH. THROUGH THE CREATION OF THE INTEGRATED CLIMATE ADAPTATION RESILIENCE PROGRAMMER I CARP WHICH IS A LEGISLATIVELY. MANDATED PROGRAM GROW THROUGH THE AYE THE CLIMATE- THAT- THE CCR PROGRAM OR THE CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCH PROGRAM ALSO IF YOU'RE STATUTES- THE- DRIVE COMMUNITY RESILIENCE PROGRAM THROUGH STATUTES SO A NUMBER OF STATUTES HAVE REGIONAL CLIMATE COLLABORATIVE START THE STATUTE CAN SEVENTY TWO. A NUMBER OF PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN CREATED YOUR STATUTE OUGHT TO OF OUR BIG RESEARCH PROGRAMS THE PRECISION MEDICINE PROGRAM AND THE ONLINE LEARNING PROGRAM BOTH CREATED YOUR STATUTES- AND- I NUMBER BROTHER SO ABSOLUTELY THERE HAVE BEEN STATUTORY GROWTH I WOULD SAY THAT'S MOST OF OUR GROUP A LITTLE BIT OF GROWTH. THROUGH EXECUTIVE ORDER SOME OF THE OTHER ITEMS WILL BE TALKING ABOUT TODAY ARE EXECUTIVE ORDER- DIRECTED BUT WHEN WE HAVE EXECUTIVE ORDER DIRECTION WE TRY OUR BEST TO DO THAT WITH EXISTING STAFF EXISTING EXPERTISE AND BY LEVERAGING OTHER AGENCIES WHICH IS A BIG. PART OF HOW WE DO OUR JOBS. K. FISHING QUESTION- SURE OF- AND- OF THE TWO. THE ONE HERE FOR YOU. DIRECTOR IS. THE. MEASURABLES DO YOU HAVE WAGED OF TRACKING THE SUCCESSES OF THE SHIP IF YOU WILL FEDERAL INVESTMENTS IN VARIOUS PROGRAMS DO YOU HAVE THE VEGETABLES THAT YOU CAN BE REPORTED TO US. WE DO ALL TALK AT THE OPR LEVEL FOR MEN AND THEN I'LL HAVE LOSE BETS WORTH I'M FROM S. G. SE BECAUSE THAT'S A BIG BIG PIECE OF OUR PROGRAM INTO SP CE AND THEN AND THEN YOU HAVE AS YOUR FROM CHALFONT TEARS. MOST OF OUR GRANT MONEY GOES OUT THROUGH THOSE TWO PROGRAMS FROM THE OPR PERSPECTIVE. ARE- OUR CENTRAL. FUNCTION IS REALLY. THESE LONG RANGE INITIATIVES PROVIDING GUIDANCE PROVIDING COLLABORATION AND SUPPORT ACROSS AGENCIES. SO A FAIR AMOUNT OF THAT IS FRANKLY MEASURED IN TERMS OF GUIDANCE WE ARE. PRODUCED THE GENERAL PLAN IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES WOULD PRODUCE THE SEQUEL GUIDELINES. THOSE ARE ALL AVAILABLE AND PRESENT ON OUR WEBSITE WE RUN THIS DEEPER CLEARING HOUSE WHICH- IS A DAY BY DAY OPERATION OF COLLECTING ALL OF THE SECRET DOCUMENTS IN THE STATE. MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE MAINTAINING THAT CLEARING HOUSE WE MAINTAIN THE CLEARING HOUSE OF. FEDERAL GRANTS COMING TO THE STATE AND WE DO A NEWSLETTER. LETTING THE EST THE STATE KNOW ABOUT HOW TO READ OPPORTUNITIES SO A LOT OF WHAT WE DO WITH THE- PR LEVEL IS FRANKLY. GUIDANCE ASSISTANCE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND THEN- WORK ACROSS AGENCIES TO MAKE SURE FRANKLY THAT. AGENCIES ARE ALIGNED AROUND MAJOR INITIATIVES OF THE OVERALL GOVERNMENT INCLUDING. RIDICULOUSLY CLIMATE CHANGE AND OUR GOAL OF HAVING A MORE SUSTAINABLE. ECONOMIC GROWTH AND PLANNING STRATEGY GOING FORWARD. OF THE TWO PROGRAMS WHERE MOST OF THE MONEY IS GOING OUT THE DOOR OUR- DISTRICT YOU'RE GREAT COUNCIL CALENDAR SO LET ME JUST ASK LOSE BEDS WITH YOU TALK FOR JUST A MINUTE. ABOUT THEIR METRICS THANK YOU. HI YES LOUISE. EXACT DIRECTOR OF THE STRATEGIC COUNCIL WE COLLECT INFORMATION BOTH IN ACCORDANCE WITH ALL OF THE CALIFORNIA CLIMATE INVESTMENTS PROTOCOLS AND FROM CALIFORNIA RESOURCES BOARD. BUT PER AT SHE C. STATUTE WE ALSO PREPARE AN ANNUAL REPORT THA WE SUBMIT TO THE LEGISLATURE THAT WE- ARE JUST A MINUTE ACTUALLY LAST AUGUST OUR MOST RECENT ANNUAL REPORT THAT CHRONICLES. ALL OF THE GRANTS THAT WE HAVE MADE- THE LOCATIONS BUT THEN ALSO METRICS SUCH AS- THE NUMBER OF HOUSING UNITS THAT HAVE PRODUCED ACRES OF LAND CONSERVED. ALL ASSOCIATED WITH EACH OF THE PROGRAMS THAT WE ADMINISTER AND WE'D BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE YOU THAT IN NO REPORT ASWELL. OKAY THANK YOU AT LAKE GENESIS TO BE THE LAST QUESTION HERE NOT SURE. ANNALISTIC BASED ON THOSE METRICS- HOW DO YOU ASSESS TE SUCCESSES. IN THESE PROGRAMS BY THE. GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH. THE DALLAS. YES THIS IS BRIAN WITH THE FORWARD- SO THERE ARE A OF WIDE RATE FRIDAY PROGRAMMATIC AREAS THAT OPR COVERS AND I DON'T HAVE MY COLLEAGUES WITH THOSE PARTICULAR AREAS OF EXPERTISE- WITH ME TODAY I WILL NOTE. THAT MANY OF THESE PROGRAMS ARE RELATIVELY NEW AND SO- IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING WE'RE STILL- YOU KNOW THE SERVING HOW THESE PROGRAMS ARE ARE PLAYING OUT AND WHAT OUTCOMES THEY ARE AS-THE- BOOK CARE NOTED THEY ARE COLLECTING. THIS METRICS ON THEM SO- WHAT WE CONTINUE TO FOLLOW THEM BUT WE CAN- FOLLOW CHRIS THAT WITH YOUR STAFF IF YOU HAVE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS I'D LIKE US TO LOOK INTO. IF YOU WOULD PLEASE WE WOULD APPRECIATE IT I HAVE HIGH RESPECTFOR YOUR AGENCY GOING BACK TO THE ALLEN POST DAIS AND- MATT TAYLOR WAS A- I WANT TO THE SAME HIGH SCHOOL AS I DID AND- THE BEST PANIC WE- HAVE A HIGH REGARD FOR HIM AS WELL SO. WE WOULD WELCOME THAT INFORMATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK NO FURTHER QUESTIONS THIS IS AN ITEM THAT WE'RE GOING TO KEEP OPEN BUT I WOULD- THAT SUGGESTS THAT THERE BE SOME DISCUSSION BETWEEN THE L. A. O. N. AS PART IN A FINANCE ABOUT. THE PARTICULARS OF THESE. OF THIS REQUEST AND IT TO REALLY IDENTIFY THE POSITIONS THAT- THEY SHOULD BE FUNDED AT THIS PARTICULAR POINT IN TIME. SO WE'LL MOVE ON THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY WILL MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER SIX WITH THE WHICH IS THE JUST TRANSITION ROADMAP. THANK YOU SO MUCH CHAIRS SO. UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S RECENT EXECUTIVE ORDER SEVENTY NINE TWENTY WHICH WAS THE EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT CALLED FOR THE STATE TO- I'D BOUGHT I HAVE A CELL ONLY ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE ONE OF THE PIECES OF THAT EXECUTIVE WORK. POINTED TO THE OFFICE OF PLANNING RESEARCH WORKING WITH THE LABOR AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AGENCY. ON DEVELOPING A JUST TRANSITION ROADMAP THIS IS A CRITICAL PIECE OF OUR OVERALL STATE GOAL. OF GETTING TO A SUSTAINABLE AND RESILIENT AND INCLUSIVE CALIFORNIA A CARBON NEUTRAL CALIFORNIA BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE. I'M DOING THAT ACROSS MANY SECTORS AND REGIONS OF THE STATE WILL REQUIRE A TRANSITION OF SOME COMMUNITIES FROM VERY RESOURCE INTENSIVE INDUSTRIES. A WORKER TRANSITION THERE ARE TAX BASES THAT ARE DEPENDENT ON SOME OF THESE INDUSTRIES- TRANSPORTATION IS ONE OF THEM- IT'S ONE OF OUR LARGEST AREAS OF TRANSFORMATION IN THE STATE. BOTH FROM A VEHICLE IF YOU'LL PERSPECTIVE BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF HOW OUR CITY IS A BIG PART OF WHAT APPEARED AS HOW ARE CITIES ARE DESIGNED AND BUILT. THE QUESTION OF JUST TRANSITION IS BY DEFINITION AN INTER AGENCY ISSUE IT GOES TO. NOT ONLY THINKING ABOUT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES ACROSS AGAIN REGIONS AND SECTORS AND WHAT KINDS OF THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE POLICIES. MAY HAVE ON THOSE COMMUNITIES- IT ALSO GOES TO THE DIRECT IMPACT CLIMATE CHANGE IS HAVING TODAY ON SOME OF OUR COMMUNITIES FOR INSTANCE YOU'RE A SUSTAINABLE GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT ACT. RESPONSE TO OUR DROUGHT CONDITIONS AND WHAT THAT MAY LOOK LIKE ON THE GROUND ECONOMICALLY AND HOW TO PLAN FOR THOSE TRANSITIONS. ALL THE PLANNING AND RESEARCH IS BY DEFINITION AN INTER AGENCY BODY- WORKING DIRECTLY UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PURVIEW WORKING ACROSS ALL OF THE OTHER AGENCIES AND WHAT WE CALL THE CLIMATE CABINET TO ALL THE OTHER AGENCIES THAT WORK ON. THESE POLICIES WE ARE IN A VERY GOOD POSITION. TO BE COORDINATING THAT WORK FIGHTING THOSE AREAS OF TRANSITION IDENTIFYING KEY RESOURCES ACROSS OTHER AGENCIES. TO HELP REGIONS AND SECTORS DEAL WITH THE TRANSITION WORKING WITH OUR COLLEAGUES GO BAD LABOR. AND OTHER AGENTS TO DO THAT- THIS THIS B. C. ASK US- IS. FOR FUNDING PRESS FOR TO POSITIONS ONE IS A POSITION THAT WE CURRENTLY ARE BORROWING FROM LABOR AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. BUT WE HAVE TO RENEW IT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND IT COMES OUT OF THEIR RAPID RESPONSE FUNDING WHICH WE ANTICIPATE WILL BE NEEDED FOR. IMMEDIATE COVERED RESPONSE AND A NUMBER OF INDUSTRIES. WE'RE ASKING FOR A CONTINUOUS FUNDING FOR THAT POSITION AS WELL AS ONE ADDITIONAL POSITION. TO RUN WHAT'S ESSENTIALLY GOING TO BE A COORDINATED STATEWIDE STRATEGY ON TRANSITION. I SHOULD JUST NOTE THAT MANY OTHER STATES THAT ARE WORKING I JUST TRANSITION ISSUES HAVE ENTIRE AGENCIES DEVOTED. TO THIS ISSUE WE ARE- AS WE DO IN GENERAL WORKING TO DO THIS WITH A VERY EFFICIENT- VERY LEAN THAT STOP APPROACH AND IT WITH COORDINATION A LEVERAGING OF EXISTING RESOURCES- I WILL SHOP THERE AND GO BACK TO YOUR- MANAGER. THANK YOU HAVE A QUESTION THANK YOU VERY MUCH- LET'S HEAR FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IN THE L. A- AND THEN WE'LL GET YOUR QUESTION SIR- IF WE COULD HEAR FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THEY MIGHT WORD OF OUR TO FINANCE NOTICE- COMMENT. THANK YOU HOW ABOUT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. YES THIS DIRECTOR GORDON NOTED THIS IS AN INTER AGENCY ISSUE IN THE TRANSITION LIKELY IS TO SPEND MANY YEARS- WE SO WE DON'T HAVE SPECIFIC COMMENTS ON THAT ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE ISSUE BUT IT MAY BE- YOU KNOW TO WORTH CONSIDERING. THAT THE THAT THE JOINT- THAT THE JUST TRANSITION ROADMAP IS NOT GOING TO BE FULLY DEVELOPED UNTIL JULY SO IT IS CHALLENGING TO EVALUATE WHETHER OPR IS THE BEST LONG TERM HOME FOR THE FUNCTION AND WHAT I'M GOING STAFF THING. IS NEEDED SO YOU MAY WANT TO CONSIDER INSTEAD PROVIDING A ONE TIME FUNDING THIS YEAR AND REVISIT IT LATER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THIRTY NIELSEN. PROVIDE GENERALIST WILL THESE POSITIONS. BE INSTRUCTIVE TO THE LEGISLATURE AS WE DEAL WITH THE VERY TROUBLED EDT AGENCY THAT AGENCY IS IN DESPERATE NEED OF CHANGE. WILL ANY OF THESE- CONTACTS THERE BE OF HELP TO GUIDE US IN FUTURE HEARINGS AS TO HOW WE DEAL WITH EDT. SO I AM NOT- FAMILIAR WITH HOW THESE POSITIONS- WHICH INTERACT WITH EDT THAT MIGHT BE- QUESTION WE COULD- CORRECT TO THE ADMINISTRATION OKAY SURE. AND THEN I THOUGHT I'D LIKE IN THE FUTURE HEARING MADAM CHAIR TO ASK SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THE SUSTAINABLE GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT THE PLANT. SO WE DON'T NEED TO DEAL WITH THAT NOW BUT- ALREADY- I CAN GIVE A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND. THE REASON EDT I. COMES UP AT ALL IN THIS CONVERSATION IS SIMPLY THAT EDT DOES THE ADMINISTRATION OF MANY CONTRACTS THROUGH THE LABOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AGENCY. THE CONTRACT HERE- THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE FOR THE POSITION FOR THE ROAD MAP COMES FROM LABOR WORKFORCE DOMINATED SHE HAPPENS TO BE ON A CONTRACT YOU ET DE BUT WE ARE NOT DIRECTLY INTERFACING WITH THE DATE. ON THIS WORK SO I DON'T THINK THAT THE TWO ISSUES ARE DIRECTLY RELATED. I WILL SAY- IN RESPONSE TO THE L. A. O. COMMENTED THAT. ALTHOUGH THE JUST TRANSITION ROAD MAP IS DUE IN JULY AT THE EXECUTIVE ORDER SPECIFICALLY SAYS THAT IT WILL THEN NEED TO BE IMPLEMENTED. AND A JUST TRANSITION AS AS WE ALL KNOW I THINK IS A LONG GAME IT'S GOING TO TAKE YEARS IT IS GOING TO BE DIFFERENT IN DIFFERENT REGIONS AND SECTORS- WE BELIEVE OPR IS IN A VERY IMPORTANT POSITION TO HELP. ALIGN REGIONAL LOCAL AND AGENCY RESOURCES TOWARD. MAKING SURE THAT THAT IS A TRANSITION THAT IS FAIR CREATES GOOD HIGH QUALITY JOBS AND- IT IS- IS INCLUSIVE SO WE SEE THIS AS A- ONGOING- SET OF IT- OF ACTIVITIES NOT I'M NOT AN ASSET ACTIVITIES ENDING IN JULY. THANK YOU. THE FOR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I'M SORRY THIS IS A- I. THAT A HOLD OPEN ITEM AND I GUESS MY COMMENT TO THIS IS THE FOLLOWING IS THAT- THE CONCERN I HAVE IS THAT THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ARE GOING TO BE FELT DIFFERENTLY THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND THE BAND IN THE COASTAL REGIONS WILL SUFFER IN A WAY THAT'S VERY DIFFERENT THAN THE INLAND REGIONS. AND TO- HAVE THIS. DISCUSSION CONVERSATION AND PLANNING. HAPPEN WITHOUT LEGISLATIVE INPUT OR DIRECTION OR PARTICIPATION HAS ME GREATLY CONCERNED- AND AWAY PARTICULARLY BECAUSE IN MANY OF OUR COUNTIES. THERE'S A FEELING THAT THE STATE GIVES IT DISCRETION TO DEPARTMENTS AND THEY'RE ON AUTOMATIC PILOT PILOT AND THEY MAKE DECISIONS WITHOUT CONSULTING WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND SOME OF THOSE DECISIONS HAVE A TREMENDOUS IMPACT EITHER ON RATE PAYERS AND THAT IN THE DISTRICTS OR ON THE- BEYOND THE COST TO BUSINESSES IN THE DISTRICT SO I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED WITH. WITH AN AUTOMATIC PILOT- PROGRAM OR OR HAVING THE ADMINISTRATION DESIGN A PROGRAM AND SAY THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO BECAUSE I DO AGREE WITH YOU I THINK THIS IS A LONG TERM- AT PLANNING PROCESS AND I DO BELIEVE- P. R. IS IN THE BEST POSITION. TO BE ABLE TO GUIDE SOME OF THIS WORK BUT I THINK- AT LEAST THAT AT FIRST BLUSH AND I'D LIKE TO HAVE A CHANCE TO HAVE MORE CONVERSATIONS WITH YOU. ON IT APPEARS TO ME THAT THIS IS THAT THIS IS. THAT WE WOULD BE PUTTING. SOMETHING THAT WILL DECIDE DECIDE THE FUTURE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IN THE HANDS OF THE ADMINISTRATION WITHOUT ANY LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT TRIBE I JUST THAT'S MY GUT REACTION TO THIS IS A HOLDOVER ITEM THERE'S MORE DISCUSSION TO BE HAD. BUT BUT I AM CONCERNED ABOUT ABOUT THAT SO- WE'RE GOING TO HOLD THIS OPEN WILL HAVE SOME MORE CONVERSATIONS AND- WELL I'M ASSUMING WILL. WILL WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO HASH THROUGH THAT. SO THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY TODAY WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO. ISSUE NUMBER SEVEN. WHICH IS THE REGIONAL CLIMATE COLLABORATIVE PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION. I WILL HAVE MY COLLEAGUE LOUISE THAT'S WORK FROM STC TAKE THIS ITEM. THREE THANK YOU- KERR CABALLERO AND MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE AGAIN I'M LOUISE THAT'S WORTH EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL- STC IS REQUESTING FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO FUNDS AND I'M GOING. TO MAINTAIN STAFFING FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SENATE BILL TEN SEVENTY TWO. WHICH DIRECTS STC TO UNDERTAKE US SERIES OF ACTIVITIES TO SUPPORT UNDER RESOURCE COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE TO HELP THEM ACCESS FUNDING- THIS INCLUDES THE DEVELOPMENT OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE GUIDELINES FOR STATE AGENCIES. AS WELL AS ESTABLISHING AND ADMINISTERING THE REGIONAL CLIMATE COLLABORATIVE'S PROGRAM- IN MINISTRY AT LEAST TWO ROUNDS OF FUNDING OVER TEN YEARS. I S. YOU SEE RECEIVED FUNDING IN THE TWENTY NINETEEN BUDGET ACT FOR TWO YEARS OF STAFFING FOR THE PROGRAM. AND DURING THAT TIME WE HAVE. COMPLETED AND ADOPTED THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE GUIDELINES FOR STATE AGENCIES. INCLUDING THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN APPENDIX TO SUPPORT TA FOR TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS. AND TRIBAL SERVING ORGANIZATIONS. WE DEVELOP THESE. ASK THROUGH AN INTER AGENCY PROCESS AS WELL AS A ROBUST SERIES OF PUBLIC COMMENTS- ONE THING THE GROUP IDENTIFIED- IN DOING THIS WORK WHAT IS THE NEED FOR CONTINUED ENGAGEMENT AND SUPPORT AS THE STATE BUILDS OUT ITS TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. ARE WE ALSO CONTINUE TO ADMINISTER THE CAT A TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR THE CALIFORNIA CLIMATE INVESTMENTS PROGRAM. BOTH SUPPORTING OUR OWN PROGRAMS AND IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OTHER AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS- WE'VE CONDUCTED AND EARLY EVALUATION ACTUALLY HAVE ANOTHER ON GOING OF THESE TA EFFORTS BUT WHAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT AS WE SHOWN THAT. APPLICANTS THAT RECEIVE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. FAR OUT COMPETE THOSE THAT DO NOT AND THAT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. BY LEVELING THE PLAYING FIELD ACROSS THE STATE IN ACCESSING STATE RESOURCES AND FUNDS. FINALLY THIS YEAR- WE LAUNCHED A LEADERSHIP TRAINING INITIATIVES- CALL PARTNERS ADVANCING CLIMATE EQUITY USING OUR TWENTY NINETEEN BUDGET ACT APPROPRIATION FOR TA. AND THEN WE AUGMENTEDTHAT WITH A GRANT WE SECURED FROM U. S. EPA. I THIS PROGRAMS GOING TO SUPPORT A COHORT OF TWENTY TWO COMMUNITY LEADERS TO BUILD PARTNERSHIPS AND GRANT READY MISS THROUGH LEADERSHIP TRAINING. BUILDING FAMILIARITY WITH STATE FUNDING AND PROGRAMS AND OTHER OPPORTUNITIES AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMMUNITY NEEDS ASSESSMENTS WE SEE THIS WORK IS PROVIDING FOUNDATIONAL WORK FOR FUTURE REGIONAL CLIMATE COLLABORATIVE'S. I AS NOTED IN THE STAFF ANALYSIS WE DO NOT CURRENTLY HAVE FUNDING FOR THE GRANT FUNDING IN THE PROGRAM. I BELIEVE THINK CONTINUED STAFFING IS A CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO MEET THE GOALS OF THE LEGISLATION AND TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT AND PARTNER WITH UNDER RESOURCE COMMUNITIES- AND SPECIFICALLY AGAIN THIS ONE COULD IMPLEMENTATION OF THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE GUIDELINES- WE'RE ALSO WORKING TO DEVELOP THE FRAMEWORK FOR THE REGIONAL CLIMATE CLEVERNESS PROGRAMS THAT WE WILL BE. READY WHEN FUNDING BECOMES AVAILABLE TO RAPIDLY DEPLOY THAT FINDING AND ADMINISTER GRANTS TO COMMUNITIES- AND THEN WE WILL CONTINUE TO IMPLEMENT- THE PARTNERS ADVANCINGJUSTICE AND EQUITY WORK AND A NUMBER OF OTHER TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE INITIATIVES WE HAVE UNDERWAY. THAT. ARE BUILDING COMMUNITY CAPACITY. TIMES CLOSE- IN NO THAT THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE NEEDS AND CAPACITY BUILDING NEEDS OF OUR COMMUNITIES HAVE ONLY BEEN HEIGHTENED DURING THE COPA NINETEEN PANDEMIC. ARE WHERE WE ARE SEEING SOME OF THE LARGEST IMPACTS IN OUR MOST UNDER RESOURCE COMMUNITIES. THE PROVISION OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND CAPACITY BUILDING HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE VERY COST EFFICIENT I IN A WAY TO SUPPORT COMMUNITIES WE SEEM COMMUNITIES DOWN THE ACCESS NOT JUST STATE FUNDING BUT OTHER FUNDING PROGRAMS AS WELL- THROUGH SOME OF OUR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PARTNERSHIPS. ASU AT A MINIMUM THE CONTINUATION OF THIS FUNDING WILL ENABLE S. YOU SEE TO CONTINUE TO CARRY THIS WORK FORWARD- AND WE THINK IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF THE STATE'S WORK TO SUPPORT COMMUNITIES. SO WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND VERY MUCH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. I REMEMBER DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WONDER ON THE GRANT FUNDING THAT WE INITIALLY INCLUDING GRANT FUNDING LAST YEAR HOWEVER WAS ALSO NOT INCLUDED IN THE FINAL BUDGET. WILL CONTINUE LOOKING AT THE POSSIBILITY OF PREFERENCE FUTURE BUT AS WE SAID THERE'S A LOT OF WORK THAT I JUST R. C. PROGRAM DOES INCLUDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAT. CREATE DIFFERENT PARTNERSHIPS. OHIO WE ARE NOT RAISING CONCERNS WITH THIS ITEM AT THIS TIME VERY GOOD. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. SENATOR NELSON COULD DO AB. I GUESS FINANCIER GIVE THE NAMES OF A FEW COMMUNITIES TO TWO THREE FIVE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE BEING SERVED. AND SOME OF THE CONNECTIVITY AS THESE COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN DIRECTED TO WORK WITH CERTAIN AGENCIES I GUESS OF THE STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DRUG KIND INVASION THE NETWORK THE FLOW CHART. SHOW IT THE CLERK IN THE QUESTION WOULD BE COMMUNITIES SERVED AND WHAT RESOURCES HAVE THEY BEEN LINKED WITH THROUGH THIS. EXPENDITURES THESE EXPENDITURES. I DO FOR YOU AS YOU SEE ON THE CITRIX I HAD THAT FROM ME I COULD ALSO GET BACK TO YOU YOUR STAFF A LATER DATE OKAY THAT THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO. LOOK AT IT IN REAL TIME AND REAL CIRCUMSTANCE AND IN REAL RESULTS SO FREE TO GET BACK ON THAT POINT THANK YOU SENATOR SENATOR NELSON I'M THIS IS LOUISE I'LL JUST STEP IN FOR A MOMENT TO SAY WERE HAPPY TO PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE LIST OF ALL THE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN SERVED- WE HAVE REACHED- YOU KNOW MANY MANY COMMUNITY SIR PROGRAMMATIC TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SO THROUGH THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES PROGRAM WE WORK WITH. MANY OF OUR APPLICANTS EACH YEAR WE'VE ALSO HAD AN INITIATIVE WITH THE INSTITUTE FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT- SERVING A NUMBER OF SPECIFIC COMMUNITIES OR SOMETHING CALLED THE BOOST INITIATIVE- AND SO I WOULD BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE THAT COMPREHENSIVE LIST I HINK YOU'LL SEE IT IS A BROAD SPECTRUM ON GEOGRAPHY. ON PROGRAMMATIC NEXUS AND ON ON WHAT THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO ACCESS BOTH IN TERMS OF OUR OWN STATE FUNDING BUT OTHER FUNDING PROGRAMS AS WELL. HAVE YOU DEALT WITH DELVED INTO OR WORKED. WITH THE TINY HOMES. THAT THE IRAQIS ARE THE HMO. TO IN THE THAT I. THE TIMING TRIPS PROJECT I THINK OF THE- ANY WITH THE TIME HOME. I WOULD HAVE TO LOOK MORE SPECIFICALLY IN SOME OF OUR- PLACE BASED INITIATIVES DIDN'T UNDERSTAND- WHAT TYPE OF THE NEXUS WE'VE HAD THERE WE CERTAINLY WORKED ON A NUMBER OF HOUSING ISSUES- BOTH AGAIN THROUGH AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES BUT THEN ALSO WITH. OTHER PLACES THAT ARE LOOKING TO DEVELOP COMMUNITY LAND TRUSTS- ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS AND OTHER SOLUTIONS THAT REALLY FIT FOR THEIR COMMUNITY CONTEXT. THANK MEASURE THANK YOU VERY GOOD- IN DIRECTOR MAYBE YOU CAN EXPLAIN TO ME WHY THERE'S NO MONEY FOR ANOTHER NO REQUEST FOR GRANT FUNDING AND ONLY FIRST FOR STAFF RIGHT IF IT IT'S ODD TO ME THAT THIS IS A GRANT PROGRAM AND I TOTALLY SUPPORT THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE- FOR UNDER RESEARCH COMMUNITY TO NO QUESTION ABOUT IT BUT AT SOME POINT. YOU KNOW AFTER TWO YEARS OF. FUNDING FOR STAFF. WE STILL HAVE A REUEST FOR GRANT MONEY AND I'M WONDERING WHAT IS IT THAT STAFF IS DOING AND- I THIS PROGRAM WAS. ORGANIZED SO THAT IT WOULD BE M. T. A. WITH WITH GRANT'S GOING OUT TO TELL ME TELL ME WHY THERE WAS NO REQUEST FOR GRANTED THIS TIME. I'M YES SO WE HAVE REQUESTED GRANT FUNDING IN THE PAST- AND THAT HIS- AND NOT COME THROUGH I THINK WE ARE. READY AND ABLE TO ADMINISTER GRANT FUNDING SHOULD IT BECOME AVAILABLE I THINK THE DECISION THIS YEAR WAS ALSO AROUND- CURRENT CONSTRAINTS ON THE STATE BUDGET BUT- OUR TEAM IS ABSOLUTELY READY AND ABLE TO ADMINISTER THOSE FUNDS AND WE STARTED TENANTS TO SKETCH OUT WHAT A PROGRAM LIKE THAT. COULD LOOK LIKE AND SO OUR GOAL IS REALLY TO BE READY TO ADMINISTER FUNDING SHOULD BE AVAILABLE. AND WE FEEL THAT WERE IN THAT POSITION. I WOULD JUST ALSO ADD- THANK YOU LOUISE TO THAT THAT- THAT THIS KIND OF TECHNICAL SYSTEMS AND CAPACITY BUILDING. IS ALSO INCREDIBLY CRITICAL IN SUPPORTING. POTENTIAL BOND FUNDING FOR INSTANCE IF THAT WERE TO COMMENT THROUGH I KNOW THEY'RE SEVERAL BILLS BEING CONSIDERED. ARE ROUND I CLIMATE RESILIENCE ANOTHER BOND MONIES AND THAT THIS KIND OF PROGRAM CAN'T BE FUNDED THROUGH BONDS BUT IS DIRECTLY SUPPORTED DO THOSE TYPES OF PROGRAMS AND SO THAT'S REALLY HOW. LOUISE AND HER TEAM HAVE DESIGNED THE PROGRAM SHOULD BE. TO BE ADDITIVE AND SUPPORTIVE OF OTHER PROGRAMS THAT ARE HAPPENING ACROSS THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL AGENCIES WHICH INCLUDES SEVEN DIFFERENT AGENCIES OF THE STATE GOVERNMENT. VERY GOOD THIS IS A HOLD OPEN ITEMS SO WE WILL HOLD IT OPEN AND- MOVE ONTO THE NEXT. THE NEXT ISSUE WHICH IS ISSUE NUMBER EIGHT WHICH IS WILDFIRE AND FOREST RESILIENCE STRATEGY ITS THE- CARE COMPONENT. BACK TO ME- THANK YOU IT CHAIR CAMBIADO I WILL JUST SAY THAT I'M I THINK YOU'VE YOU'VE PROBABLY HAD A CHANCE TO DISCUSS AND LOOK AT THE- LARGER WILDFIRE BUDGET PROPOSAL THAT CAME OUT OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THAT IS AN EARLY ACTION PROPOSAL TO A GREAT EXTENT. THERE IS A PIECE OF THAT PROPOSAL THAT FOCUSES ON ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND I'LL JUST TALK ABOUT THAT FOR A MINUTE BECAUSE OF A THAT IS THAT A PIECE THAT IS SHARED BETWEEN GO BIZ AND OPR. WE ALL KNOW THAT WILDFIRE RESPONSE IN FOREST MANAGEMENT ARE CRITICAL CRITICAL NEEDS OF OUR STATE NEEDS URGENT TOP OF MY NEEDS. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT- IS TALK ABOUT A LITTLE BIT LESS IS THAT THROUGHALL THE FOREST MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES THAT WE'RE DOING AT THE STATE AND HAVE BEEN DOING. I THROUGH S. B. NOT A ONE AND OTHER OTHER LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES. IS BRINGING A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF BIOMASS FOREST BIOMASS OUT OF THE FOREST AS PART OF REPORTS MANAGEMENT A WILDFIRE REDUCTION STRATEGY. I THAT BIOMASS IS IN SOME CASES OF BEING LEFT ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD OR IN FACT BEING PILED BURNED IN SOME CASES THAT IS ALSO TRUE OF SOME OF THE WOODY BIOMASS WE HAVE COMING OUT OF- ORCHARDS AND OTHER AGRICULTURAL LANDS. AT THE SAME TIME THESE ARE ALSO COMMUNITIES THAT REALLY DESPERATELY NEED ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT APPROACHES TO SUPPORT OUGHT TO SUPPORT THEM IN SOME WAYS- I WOULD SAY CHAIR THAT THAT THESE ARE. THESE ARE REGIONS THAT NEED A JUST TRANSITION STRATEGY THAT THAT HAVE ARE LOOKING FOR A REGIONALLY DRIVEN STRATEGY ON HOW TO USE EXISTING RESOURCE AND REALLY MOVE INTO A MORE SUSTAINABLE SET OF INDUSTRIES. WE REALLY SEE- THE BUDGET REQUEST IN A WILDFIRE PROPOSAL WHICH IS A REQUEST FOR THREE MILLION DOLLARS- TWO POINT FIVE MILLION WOULD BE FOR A SET OF FIVE PILOT PROJECTS. AND FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND FOR IDEAL LEVERAGE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR AN X. PRIZE THESE WOULD REALLY BE FOCUSED ON. HELPING TO SUPPORT SOME OF THE MOST INNOVATIVE IDEAS COMING OUT OF THESE REGIONS AND COLLABORATIONS IN THESE REGIONS TO IDENTIFY TWO AND OVERCOME MARKET BARRIERS TO USING THAT BIOMASS AND TURNING IT INTO A VIABLE INDUSTRY. WHETHER THAT'S AS- I SUSTAINABLE- HI ABA. FUEL INDUSTRY A CROSS ONE TO TEN INDUSTRY. BUILDING TEMPER DRIVER THINGS THE TINY HOMES THAT. THAT CENTER NIELSEN TALKED ABOUT. THESE AREAS HAVE COALITIONS OF FOLKS WHO WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH FOR YEARS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THEM THROUGH THE WOOD UTILIZATION GROUP OF THE FOREST. MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE THEY HAVE GREAT IDEAS THEY WANT TO GET STARTED THEY HAVE PILOT PROJECT IDEAS WE'D LOVE TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THEM. I AGREE WITH YOU A 100% SHARE THAT. JUST TRANSITION STRATEGIES AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES MUST HAPPEN FROM THE REGIONS AND THEIR DIFFERENT ACROSS REGIONS. AS WE'RE THINKING ABOUT ARE JUST TRANSITION ROADMAP IT REALLY IS JUST A SET OF KEY PRIORITIES. THAT WOULD ALLOW THE STATE TO SUPPORT REGION'S TO COME UP WITH THESE TYPES OF STRATEGIES AND WE SEE THIS. ONE ARE PROPOSAL AS DOING JUST THAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AND WEBER THE FINANCE NOTATIONAL COMES IN THIS ONE ABOUT THE L. A. L. D. ON THIS THIS ITEM IS PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S WILDFIRE RESILIENCE PACKAGE IN OUR ANALYSIS OF THE OVERALL PACKAGE WE OFFER TO GENERAL COMMENTS THAT. RELATE TO THIS ITEM IN PARTICULAR THE FOCUS ON WILDFIRE PREVENTION AND MITIGATION IS MERIT AND THE MYRIAD. RISKS OF WELFARE WEREN'T MULTIPLE STRATEGIES AS THE MINISTRATIONS NOTED DEVELOPING THE PRIVATE MARKET FOR FOREST BIOMASS WOOD PRODUCTS WOULD. COULD ACHIEVE SEVERAL COMPLEMENTARY POLICY GOALS AND- THE CALL HAS MERIT AND IT'S A CONSISTENT WITH THE GOALS AND- OUTLINED IN THE- THE GOVERNOR'S WILDFIRE FORCE MANAGEMENT ACTION PLAN ON TO ENHANCE SUSTAINABLE TIMBER HARVEST SO. THE FUNDING REQUEST BY OPR WOULD FUND FIVE PILOT PROJECTS AND A WOOD PRODUCTS EXPRESS. AND WHILE WE DON'T HAVE WE DON'T HAVE MUCH DETAIL ABOUT HOW EXACTLY THESE NEW PROGRAMS ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED- AND AS THEY WOULD BE COMPLETELY NEW PROGRAMS WE CAN'T REALLY ASSESS THEIR AFFECT POTENTIAL EFFECTIVENESS TOWARDS DEVELOPING THE MARKET FOR FORCED. BIOMASS WOOD PRODUCTS. HOPE YOUR STATUS. FOR REQUEST CAREER FOR IS TO BEGIN TO ESTABLISH THE WITH FEEDSTOCK PILOT PROJECTS IN THE CURRENT YEAR. AND IN OUR VIEW THIS IS NOT A COMPELLING RATIONALE FOR EARLY ACTION FUNDING WELL IT IS REASONABLE TO ASSUME THAT OPR COULD PREPARE GRANT AGREEMENT FOR THESE PROJECTS SEVERAL MONTHS EARLIER. PROVIDING A CURRENT YEAR AUGMENTATION THAT WOULD REDUCE THE LEGISLATURE'S ABILITY TO CONSIDER THE SPENDING IN THE CONTEXT OF ITS BROADER GENERAL FUND PRIORITIES. SHOULD YOU PROVIDE FUNDING FOR THIS PROGRAM WE WOULD RECOMMEND ALSO THAT YOU ADD ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES SO THAT WE CAN UNDERSTAND LATER EVALUATE HOW SUCCESSFUL THESE NEW PROGRAMS WERE IN DEVELOPING THE MARKET FOR FOREST BIOMASS WOOD PRODUCTS. I THINK I THINK YOU FOR THAT LAST COMMENT BECAUSE I THINK THE- ACCOUNTABILITY AND HOW WE- EVALUATE THE SUCCESS OF THE OF THE PILOT PROJECT IS GOING TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT SO IS IT. TO CREATE JOBS IS IT TOO- ELIMINATE WOULD WASTE. TIME AND MAYBE IT'S ALL OF THE ABOVE BUT HAVING ECONOMY MEASURES I THINK WOULD BE VERY VERY APPROPRIATE. CENTER NIELSEN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. I'M VERY. EXCITED ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR AREA. AND I MIGHT NOTE THAT THEIR SENATOR DOLLY AND ASSEMBLYWOMAN DAHLE A. R. AS WELL. A TECHNICIAN- DOLLY AND I WORKED TOGETHER AND I HAVE LITERALLY FOR DECADES. IN THE MID EIGHTIES I WAS ABLE TO HELP DON'T DEVELOP A CO GENERATION FACILITY THAT HAS BURNED UP 290% OF THE RIFLES. IN CALIFORNIA WHICH HAVE HELPED SHAPE THE RICE INDUSTRY AND ADDITION THAT PARTICULAR PLANT WAS THE FIRST IN THE WORLD THAT COULD BURN RICE STRAW. NOW THAT THAT ISN'T NECESSARILY MY POINT HERE BUT- THE DECADES BIOMASS IS GONNA JUST DIED ON THE VINE IF YOU WILL THAT WOULD ACTUALLY OVER RESISTANCE TO CITING BIOMASS PLANTS. AND FOR MANY REASONS BOTH OF THEM HAVE GONE. AND AS I JUST NOTED HERE THE HOLES WOULD BE CONSIDERED AN AGRICULTURAL WASTE BUT THERE ARE MANY OTHERS TO LIKE CHRONIXX ORCHARDS AND VINEYARDS. AND WE'VE GOT A HUGE PROBLEM IN CALIFORNIA WITH THE DISPOSAL OF THOSE WASTE PRODUCTS. AND I'D LIKE TO PUT OUR STAFF IN TOUCH WITH THE PARTICULAR AREA UP IN THE BUTTE COUNTY CALL CAPTAIN BILL. NOW IT'S GETTING TO THE POINT. I'M VERY INTERESTED IN GETTING INFORMATION AS TO WHAT THE STATE IS GOING TO DIRECTLY DUE TO ENCOURAGE MORE BIOMASS DISPOSAL. IN CALIFORNIA FOR OUR PORSCHE AND OUR WILD LANDS. AND EVEN AS WAS THE CASE WITH THE- THE RICE ALL OF THE BY PRODUCTS OF THE GRICULTURAL WASTE AGRICULTURAL WASTE- CHAU. IT I WOULD IT'S BEEN MY IMPRESSION THAT IN RECENT YEARS THERE'S BEEN MORE. ATTENTION SPENT TO THE SHERIFF BUT I THINK I'M FAIR TO. OUR DRY SENATOR DOLLY AND MY EXPERIENCE SO IT'S PRETTY FRUSTRATED. THAT WE HAVE NOT MADE MUCH PROGRESS SO WE WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE GETTING INTO THIS MUCH DEEPER IN A FUTURE HEARING. MUCH MORE INFORMATION ABOUT HOW WE ARE PROGRESSING POLITICAL GENERATION. DECADES AGO. IN REGARD MANY DECADES THERE USED TO BE SOMETHING CALLED STANDARD OFFER FOR CONTRACTS WHICH WAS A BIT OF AN INCENTIVE. TWO THE ONES WHO WOULD DELIVER THE BOTTLENECKS. I DON'T THINK THAT'S BEEN AROUND FOR DECADES AND I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT THAT WOULD BE A PART OF THE FUTURE AT ALL. HOWEVER I AM INTERESTED IN FINDING OUT WHAT THINGS ARE BEING DONE TO HELP FOR EXAMPLE THE CITING. OF BY AMASH ASSISTING ARE THERE ARE EVEN- THE MOBILE. UNITS THAT CAN BE USED TO UNDERSTAND SO IF WE CAN DO MADAM CHAIR AND A FUTURE HERE AND GET A LITTLE MORE IN DEPTH IN THIS AREA I'M SURE THE DOLLARS AND I WOULD APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR NELSON AND I WILL TELL YOU OUT OF SECOND WEEK WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT THAT. THEY'RE NOT BEING THE APPETITE IN THE LEGISLATURE FOR BIOMASS- THAT CONVERSION OF DEAD OR DYING TREES PARTICULARLY IN THE HIGH RISE FIRE YEAH I HAD A BILL FOR TWO YEARS AND COULDN'T GET IT OUT OF THE ASSEMBLY- BACK OVER TO THE SENATE AND SO I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT THIS THIS NOT ONLY HELPS TO SOLVE AGRICULTURAL WASTE ISSUES. BUT BOBBY'S HUNDRED FORTY FOUR MILLION DEAD OR DYING TREES- MANY THAT ARE CREATING THESE ARE CRAZY WILDFIRES THAT WE'VE SEEN OVER THE PAST NUMBER OF YEARS AND SO- FIVE BOB PILOT PROJECTS IS EXCITING TO ME AND- WILL ALSO HELP US TO CREATE JOBS IN A PART OF THE STATE WHERE JOBS ARE HARD TO FIND AND- AND WILL HELP US TO SOLVE ONE OF THE ECOLOGICAL ISSUES WE HAVE WHICH IS. THIS THE RAGING WILDFIRES COULD BETTER FIVE IN PART BECAUSE WE HAVE SO MANY TREES THAT ARE NOT NOT ALIVE ANYMORE AND THAT THAT NEED TO BE TAKEN OUT SO- THIS IS A- IN AB- HOLD OPEN ITEM SO WE WILL WE WILL CONTINUE TO HOLD IT OPEN AND- AND HAVE SOME ORE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT WHAT THE MEASURE BOTH MIGHT BE. AND AND MAYBE THE KINDS OF PROJECTS YOU ENVISION SUPPORTING THAT WOULD HELP US TO UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT BETTER- GET THE SIX I. ABOUT THE- WHERE YOU PROPOSED ON THIS. SO THAT I ISSUE EIGHT THANK YOU MUCH- TO THE- FOR TO BE HERE TODAY FOR THIS COMMITTEE BUT- WANTED TO SAY. THIS IS PART OF A LARGER STRATEGY THAT WE ARE WORKING ON IN COLLABORATION WITH GO BIZ AND THAT THERE IS ANOTHER PIECE OF IT WHICH IS A- FULL TIME POSITION ECHO BASE THAT WOULD BE AN INTERFACE TO TRY TO HELP BUILD OUT THESE MARKETS AS WELL AS- ALMOST FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS INTO THE CLIMATE CATALYST FUND FOR MORE IF I'M- MORE DEVELOPED AND SLIGHTLY LESS HIGH RISK PROJECTS IN THE SAME AREA SO. WE SEE IT AS A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY WERE ALSO VERY EXCITED ABOUT IT WOULD LOVE TO TALK ABOUT IT MORE. OKAY GREAT. THAT SOUNDS GOOD.

HI MY NAME'S MERRY READ I'M THE CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION I'D LOVE TO HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE IN AND BEEN SUCCESSFUL AT- SO ONE OF THE THINGS I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT IS THAT WE'VE BEEN A KEY PLAYER IN ASSISTING WITH THE STATE'S RENTAL PROTECTION EFFORTS- WE SERVED IN THE BUSINESS CONSUMER- THESE HOUSING AND SOCIAL SERVICE TASK FORCE. WE WERE CALLED READING ACTION AREA ONE TO ENSURE CALIFORNIA'S ACHIEVE AND MAINTAIN STABLE HOUSING FOR RENTAL ASSISTANCE FORECLOSURE PREVENTION AND POLICY. SO THIS FUNDING WOULD CONTINUE OUR EFFORTS AND HELP US FIND THE POSITION THAT FUNDS ONE OF OUR CALIFORNIA'S FOREMOST HOUSING EXPERTS WHICH WAS THE KEY PERSON THAT HELPED WITH THE TASK FORCE. I'M TO SPECIFICALLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION REGARDING OUR EMPLOYER OUTREACH. THIS FUNDING ALLOWED US TO ENGAGE IN A CONTRACT WITH SENSYS AGENCY AND WE HAVE JUST LAUNCHED A KEEP CALIFORNIA FAIR- MOTION AND YOU CAN LOCATE IT AT OUR WEBSITE AT U. H. DOT CA DOT GOV SLASH KEEP CALIFORNIA FAIR IT HAS VIDEOS AND OUTREACH MATERIAL THAT TARGET WILL COMPLY YEARS AND EMPLOYEE USE THE ONLINE- THAT. WORK THAT D. F. EACH DOESN'T RIGHTS. OF CITIZENS IN CALIFORNIA. WE'VE DEVELOPED A MOBILE APP TO HELP EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES NAVIGATE THEIR WAY AROUND UNDERSTANDING THEIR FAMILY AND PREGNANCY LEAVE BACK. RIGHT AND WE'VE LAUNCHED A SEXUAL HARASSMENT PREVENTION TRAINING ONLINE FREE TO ALL EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES IN CALIFORNIA- AS A RESULT OF SB THIRTEEN FORTY THREE WHICH CAME JUST IN TIME AS ALL OF THE EMPLOYER EMPLOYEES A SHELTERED IN PLACE AND WEREN'T ABLE TO GO TO THE WORK PLACE TO ATTEND IN PERSON TRAINING SO THAT WAS JUST LAUNCHED. WE ALSO REVAMPED ALL OF OUR PUBLICATIONS AND OUR OUTREACH MATERIALS AND THEY'RE AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE WE HAVE NEW POSTERS AND BROCHURES AVAILABLE IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES AVAILABLE TO BOTH EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYERS EDUCATE PEOPLE ON THEIR RIGHTS AND THAT'S AVAILABLE VIA OUR WEBSITE AND THERE IS A SPECIFIC EMPLOYER- PORTION OF OUR WEBSITE JUST TO EDUCATE THOSE EMPLOYERS THAT ARE WANTING TO DO THE RIGHT THING BUT SHE'S YOU KNOW A LITTLE HELP NAVIGATING ERROR- RESPONSIBILITIES IN CALIFORNIA. HELLO THE CEMEX EFFORT AND I COMMEND YOU FOR THAT YOU KNOW- OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVE LARGE EMPLOYERS SHOULD HAVE THE WHERE WITH ALL TO. HAVE IN HOUSE CAPACITY TO PROVIDE ADVICE AND ASSISTANCE YOU HAVE SOME THAT ARE SO LARGE BUT HAVE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES TO HIRE ATTORNEYS AND CONSULTANTS TO DO THAT. BUT THEN YOU HAVE A LARGE GROUP OF SMALL AND EMPLOYERS IN IN SOME VERY VERY SMALL EMPLOYERS. WHO DON'T HAVE THOSE RESOURCES TO EITHER HER LAWYERS CONSULTANTS FOR STEP UP INSIDE. AND WITHIN THE LAST YEAR TO MAYBE MORE SINCE I'VE BEEN UP HERE WE HAVE. PERHAPS APPROPRIATELY DRIVEN DOWN THE THRESHOLD FOR COVERAGE OF MANY OF OUR LAWS THAT TERM GOVERNMENT EMPLOYER CONTACTED EMPLOYEE RIGHTS- BUT WE'VE NOW DRIVEN LISTS SOME OF THOSE OBLIGATIONS DOWN TO THE POINT WHERE YOU'RE DEALING WITH SOME VERY VERY SMALL. EMPLOYERS EMPLOYERS THAT IN SOME CASES HAVE ONE EMPLOYEE IN SOME CASES. EMPLOYERS HAVE FIVE EMPLOYEES WHO MAY NOT HAVE ACCESS TO. COMPUTERS OR THE INTERNET OR AT LEAST A LOT OF IT MAY NOT KNOW WHERE TO GO HOW TO DEAL WITH WHAT THEY SEE ON THE INTERNET AND I THINK AS WE MOVE FORWARD AS WE CONSIDER THIS BUDGET REQUEST IN THOSE IN THE FUTURE. YOU MAY WANT TO GIVE MORE THOUGHT TO HOW WE ACTUALLY DRIVE THIS INFORMATION DOWN. TO THE EMPLOYER AND FRESNO OR THE EMPLOYER AND LIFE THAT HAS MAYBE TWO EMPLOYEES. IS COVERED BY PROVISIONS OF FIANNA- AND DEALT WITH BY YOUR DEPARTMENT BUT DOESN'T REALLY HAVE THE- THE WHERE WITH ALL. TO FIND OUT WHAT THE PERSON OR THE EMPLOYER NEEDS TO DO IT MAY EXIST AND AGAIN I COMMEND YOU FOR YOUR EFFORTS I'M JUST ASKING THAT YOU TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT HALLVARD DRIVING THIS INFORMATION DOWN TO THE- VERY VERY VERY SMALL EMPLOYER COMMUNITY SO. AS A STATE AND AS A STATE DEPARTMENT AND WE TRY OUR BEST TO HELP KEEP THEM OUT OF TROUBLE RATHER THAN DEAL WITH THEM. AS OF ONCE THEY GET INTO IT THANK YOU VENTURE. VERY VERY GOOD POINT DEPRECIATE THAT BOTH COMMENTED AND THANK YOU TO THE APARTMENT FOR YOUR YOUR EXPLANATION I WAS VERY HELPFUL. I'M A LOT OF INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE HERE FROM. IF PEOPLE KNOW WHERE TO FIND IT SO I REALLY DO APPRECIATE ON. THE MATERIALS THIS IS A HOLDOVER OPEN ITEM- SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERETODAY IT WILL BE SEEING THIS AND ON A FUTURE DATE WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. ISSUE NUMBER TEN WHICH IS PROUD TO COUNTY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- MY NAME'S ZACH HOLMES SAID I AM THE CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. I WILL- PRESENT AT HOME HE HAVE NEVER MY COLLEAGUES HERE FOR SOME OF THE OTHER ITEMS ON THE AGENDA TODAY AS WELL- BUT I'LL START HOME HE- WHIH IS A AND SEVEN OR FIFTY MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND REQUEST. TO ALLOW EACH YOU NEED TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE GRANTS TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO PURCHASE AND CONVERT HOTELS. AND OTHER FACILITIES INTO INTERIM IN PERMANENT HOUSING FOR THOSE PERSONS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. AND THERE IS AN EARLY ACTION REQUESTED ONE OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION- TO MEET DEMAND INSISTING THE PROGRAM'S MOMENTUM. THERE'S ALSO ACCOMPANYING PROPOSED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO KEEP THE MAIN COMPONENTS OF THE PROGRAM WITH A FEW TWEAKS- TO THE PROGRAM TIMELINES THE TARGET POPULATIONS AND TO ELIGIBLE APPLICANTS TO INCREASE THE PROGRAM'S IMPACT. OF THOSE INCLUDE EXTENDING THE PROGRAM TIMELINE. TO THREE YEARS- THANK. THE TARGET POPULAR TO THOSE AT RISK OF COMMUNICABLE DISEASES. AND INCLUDING ELIGIBLE APPLICANTS TO ALSO INCLUDE CLEANING AGENCIES LIKE COUNCILS OF GOVERNMENT- I'LL JUST SAY ONE THING AND IN REGARDS TO THE REQUEST. EVERY TIME WE PUT OUT REQUESTS FOR FUNDING I KNOW IT'S A FUNDING BILL ABILITY WE ARE VASTLY OVERSUBSCRIBED FOR PROGRAMS ANY CD AND HUNKY- SPECIAL THE FIRST AROUND WAS NO EXCEPTION. IT WAS TWO TO THREE TIMES OVERSUBSCRIBED IN EVERY REGION OF THE STATE WITH THE INITIAL NO FOR WE PUT OUT. LAST YEAR OF SIX HUNDRED MILLION AS YOU KNOW THERE WAS AN INITIAL TWO HUNDRED MILLION ABA- AUGMENTATION SO WE ARE ABLE TO FIND EVEN MORE. BUT EVEN SO WE ARE VASTLY OVERSUBSCRIBED DESPITE THE AGGRESSIVE TIMELINES THAT WE HAD TO NEEDS. UTILIZING THE FUNDS FROM THE CURRENT ACTUALLY FUNDS- SO WE'VE ALREADY HEARD FROM A NUMBER OF JURISDICTIONS AND IT'LL FOR PARTNERS. ARE REACHING OUT ASKING- WITH SPECIFIC PROJECTS IN MIND WHEN FUNDS MAY BECOME AVAILABLE AGAIN. THOSE CONTACTS HAVE INCLUDED BOTH APPLICANTS AND NON APPLICANTS FROM THAT FIRST ROUND OF FUNDING. SO WE'RE VERY CONFIDENT THAT THERE IS SIGNIFICANT DEMAND TO- UTILIZE MORE FUNDS IN THE SPACE. SO I'M SURE YOU HAVE QUESTIONS I'M HAPPY. TO ANSWER THEM- AT YOUR CAN BE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- DEPARTMENT FINANCE. PRETTY TOPS IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE ADMINISTRATION STRONGLY SUPPORTS THIS UP PROPOSAL IN A SECRET AS AN EARLY ACTION ITEM SO THAT WE CAN TO QUICKLY FOLLOW UP ON THE GROUNDWORK LAID BY THE FIRST ROUND OF THE HOME HE GRACE- ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH LEGISLATIVE ANALYSTS OFFICE. HELLO THIS MORALES WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. I'M I JUST A MOMENT TO PUT THIS PROPOSAL IN CONTACT OF THE GOVERNOR'S BROADER HOMELESSNESS PLAN THIS IS ONE OF THREE MAJOR PROPOSALS RELATED TO HOMELESSNESS WHICH WOULD PROVIDE A TOTAL OF ONE POINT SEVEN FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. TO PROVIDE A NUMBER OF PROGRAMS AND MAINTAIN BASES WITHIN EACH CITY BUT ALSO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND PERMANENT SOCIAL SERVICES ALL THE PROPOSALS TO FOCUSED ON THE ACQUISITION AND REHABILITATION OF PROPERTY AS A RESULT WE DO HAVE SOME SORT OF BROAD QUESTIONS RELATED TO MUSCLES FOR EXAMPLE. OF WHAT OPPORTUNITY IS THERE. FOR A LOCAL ENTITIES TO MAINTAIN THESE. PLEASE PROPERTY ONGOING BASIS NOT ONLY THE MINUTES OF THE PROPERTY BUT THEN ALSO ANY NECESSARY WRAPAROUND SERVICES THAT MAY BE NECESSARY. AS WELL AS BECAUSE OF THE FOCUS ON ACQUISITION HELLO ALL THREE PROPOSALS WOULD WORKS. TOGETHER TO EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS. RELATED TO THE HOME HE PROPOSAL SPECIFICALLY. WE WOULD NOTE THAT THE EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS PROVIDED FOR HOME KEY. PREVIOUSLY IT WAS UNDER REALLY TIGHT TIMELINES GIVEN IT WAS PRIMARILY FUNDED THROUGH FEDERAL RELIEF THAT HAD THIS TYPE TIMELINE. THAT WOULDN'T BE THE CASE UNDER THIS PROPOSAL WHICH PROVIDES GENERAL FUND AND SO THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO THINK ABOUT WHAT OTHER CRITERIAS RATHER THAN- EXPEDIENCY MIGHT BE MOST BENEFICIAL AS YOU AWARD THIS FUNDING TO GOING FORWARD. AS A RESULT. GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT HAS ALREADY GONE OUT THERE'S OPPORTUNITY TO ASSESS AND HOW THINGS ARE GOING AND WHETHER THERE'S ANY NECESSARY. CHANGES ONE OF THE ISSUES WITH THE PROJECT ROOM KEY ON WHICH IS OUR PRESIDENT OF THIS. PROGRAM ARE SOME CHALLENGES. WHAT OCCUPANCY RATE. AND SO ON- SENDING- WHERE THE SUCCESS AND WEBER THE CHALLENGES AND ONE. NEED TO BE. ON WOULD BE INFORMATIVE MOVING FROM. AND THEN FINALLY AS A RESULT- IN REFERENCE TO THE EARLY ACTION. THE KEY QUESTION THERE IS WHETHER THERE IS IN FACT- CUT CAPACITY TO- TO MOVE FORWARD IN THE- CURRENT YEAR. I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY OF YOUR QUESTIONS THANK YOU. VERY GOOD. COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS YOUR- ROTH IRA. THANK YOU MANAGER PRESIDENT JOHNSON. YOU KNOW FOLLOWING ON THE ALEJO'S COMMENT- GIVEN THE SHIFT IN THE NATURE OF THE FUNDING FROM PRIMARILY FEDERAL TO GENERAL FUND- SHOULD WE NOT NOW PROVIDE MORE OF A FOCUS ON ONE ONGOING OPERATIONAL FUNDING IN THE V- THE NATURE OF THAT THAN THE EXTENT OF THAT AS PART OF THIS PROGRAM AND IF NOT. WHAT WHAT WHAT REALLY IS THE VALUE OF SIMPLY PROVIDING A ROOM ISN'T THERE MORE TO THIS PROGRAM AND TO THE TO THE SOLUTION OVERALL THAN SIMPLY A ROOM. BUT AREN'T SUPPORTIVE SERVICES FOR EARLY CRITICAL ON HOW DO WE EVALUATE. THAT IN THE PROCESS WE WOULD CALL THAT A COMPOUND QUESTION IN LAW SCHOOL I CAN BREAK IT DOWN BUT THE POINT IS. ARE WE CONSIDERING ONGOING FUNDING. SHOULD WE BE PROVIDING THAT OUT OF THE GENERAL FUND. AND IF NOT WHY NOT. I'M HAPPY TO ADDRESS THAT- SENATORS- PREJUDICE UNDERSTANDING THERE WAS OPERATION SUPPORT ARE PROVIDED TO EACH AND EVERY PROJECT IN THE INITIAL ON KEY ROUTE IN FACT THE STATE PROVIDED AT LEAST TWO YEARS OF OPERATING SUPPORT UP FRONT OFFER EACH AND EVERY PROJECT- SO THAT WOULD CONTINUE UNDER THIS THE FLEXIBILITY GENERAL FUND WILL CONTINUE TO ALLOW FOR THAT. AND I WAS BECAUSE FIFTY MILLION WAS INCLUDED IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET TO AUGMENT THE SIERRA FUNDS TO ALLOW FOR US TO PROVIDE THAT pABLE TO BE CONTINUED. ADDITIONALLY WE REQUIRED PROJECTS TO IDENTIFY FIVE YEARS OF OPERATING SUPPORT SO THEY WERE ABLE TO DO THAT THE LOCAL SOURCES OF THE RECEIVING AUTHORIZED THERE'S QUITE A FEW- RESOURCE RESOURCE AVAILABLE TO DO SO- OBVIOUS A LOT OF FEDERAL FUNDS FLOWING AS WELL SO THAT IS ACTUALLY QUITE UNIQUE. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DEVELOPING PERMITS SUPPORTIVE HOUSING HOUSING FOLKS ARE HOMELESS- MAYBE IT'S A DIRTY SECRET BUT I'M HAPPY SHARED HERE IT'S OFTEN QUITE CHALLENGING TO FIND ONGOING OPERATING SUPPORT FIVE YEARS IS ACTUALLY MORE THAN THE NORM. SO OUR REQUIREMENT FOR THAT ACTUALLY NEED THESE PROJECTS QUITE SUSTAINABLE WE'RE CONFIDENT THAT- THERE'S A LOT OF RESOURCES OUT THERE INCLUDING SOME ADMINISTERED BY A CD AND ONGOING FASHION HELPS. DEAL WITH ALMOST IS OF COURSE A MATTER OF POLITICAL WILL SO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WILL HAVE TO CONTINUE TO. PRIMARILY FOCUS THEIR EFFORTS IN THAT WAY CERTAINLY BUT WE'RE HAPPY TO WORK WITH ALL PROJECTS AND THAT'S WHAT WE DID THE FIRST TIME AROUND TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE WAS ADEQUATE SUPPORT MOVING FORWARD. WHAT IS IT WHEN IT WHAT WE DO TYPICALLY IS IT'S ESSENTIALLY CAPITALIZED OPERATING SUPPORT UP FRONT SO YOU MAY NOT BE USING IT ALL BUT YOU'RE DRAWING DOWN FROM THAT OVER TIME SO WE HAVE A NUMBER OF OUR- PRETTY LANDMARK SUPPORTIVE HOUSING PROGRAMS FOR EXAMPLE DO YOU THAT IT PROVIDES. A CAPITALIZE OPERATING SUPPORT UP FRONT THAT CAN BE DRAWN DOWN OVER TIME AND THAT'S A SIMILAR MODEL THAT IS KIND OF BEEN UTILIZED HERE- WITH BOTH LOCAL SOURCES AND WHAT THE SORT RESOURCES PROVIDE. SO I WOULD COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU IT IS NOT JUST ABOUT THE REAL AND THESE PROJECTS ARE NOT JUST ABOUT THOSE THE ROOM THE ACQUISITION IS QUITE UNIQUE BECAUSE YOU'RE UTILIZING EXISTING FACILITIES AND MOST. OF THE TIME HOTELS AND MOTELS AND I AS WELL THIS IS FOR LESS EXPENSIVE THAN YOU. BUT CERTAINLY A HUGE. FOR INTERIM PERMANENT. IN THAT OPERATING ZERO SUPPORT WE WERE A TO BUY THE FIRST AROUND IT WAS. ANTICIPATED SO. YOU INTEND TO CONTINUE THE FIVE YEAR. REQUIREMENT ON A GO FORWARD BASIS. I THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA FOR A SUSTAINABILITY IN TERMS OF- MAKING SURE THESE PROJECTS HAVE THE POLITICAL SUPPORT LOOK LEVEL BUT WE MAY EVEN BE ABLE TO PROVIDE MORE ADDITIONAL OFFERING SUPPORT THEY WERE THE FIRST AROUND WE WERE ABLE TO PROVIDE UP TO TWO YEARS OF THAT FIVE YEARS FOR EVERY PROJECT- THE FIRST TIME AROUND SO WE MAY BE ABLE TO DO MORE OF THAT. GIVEN THE GREATER FLEXIBILITY OF GENERAL FUND DOLLARS- BUT WE DO BELIEVE IT IS IMPORTANT FROM THE OUTSET TO DETERMINE HOW YOU GONNA FONG I THINK ANOTHER COMPONENT IS MANY OF THESE PROJECTS ARE BEGIN TO OPERATE AS INTERIM HOUSING AND THEN PLAN TO CONVERT TO FULLY TO PERMANENT HOUSING IN WHICH CASE AT THOSE THAT THOSE STAGES THERE OTHER RESOURCE AVAILABLE TO THEM OFF FOR THE CONVERSION AS WELL AS OTHER INCOME STREAMS WILL NOT ROBUST. ARE THEY WILL BE COLLECTING RENTS OF COURSE ON THOSE PROPERTIES EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE PERMITS FOR HOUSING- THEY WILL STOP SHORTFALL THEY NEED TO MAKE UP BUT THERE WILL BE LESS ONCE THEY ARE GETTING REVENUE. I'M SOMEWHAT FAMILIAR WITH THIS. IN IN THE CONTEXT OF VETERANS. SUPPORT OF HOUSING. IT WAS BOND MONEY WHICH CAN USE BOND MONEY TO FOR OPERATING SUPPORT. AND THE- THE DIFFICULTY AT LEAST THAT SOMEWHERE FINDING TRYING TO SECURE THE- SUPPORT OF SERVICES COMPONENT OF. PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING OR TEMPORARY SUPPORT OF HOUSING. HAVE SO AS PART OF THIS EXPENDITURE AUTHORIZATION. HAVE YOU ANALYZED THE FINANCIAL CAPABILITY OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO PROVIDE ONGOING PERMANENT AND ONGOING SUPPORTIVE SERVICES FOR THESE PROJECTS ONCE WHATEVER TIMELINE USE THAT RUNS OUT. WELL THAT WAS WHY WE HAD THE FIVE YEAR RISING THAT THEY HAD TO COMMIT TO SO THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WAS PART OF THAT EVALUATION RIGHT IN WORKING WITH THEM TO DETERMINE THAT THOSE WERE REAL AND ACTIONABLE AND SO WE OF COURSE WANTED TO SEE IF WE WERE ABLE TO SEE THE LOCALLY ALL THE PROJECTS WITH CELEBRITY SUPPORTS IT WAS NOT COMPLETELY ON THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. AND IN FACT PHILANTHROPIC PARTNERS CAME IN WITH SOME ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR QUITE HELPFUL- BUT YES THAT IS PART OF THE EVALUATIVE COMPONENT IS MAKING SURE THAT THESE PRODUCTS ARE REAL CERTAINTY THAT THE PROVISION OF SERVICES THE SERVICES PLANS THOSE ARE ALL PART OF THE ACT OF THAT APPLICATION- IT IS NOT IT WAS NOT JUST EXPEDIENCY WELL THAT WAS QUITE IMPORTANT IN THE FIRST ROUND. BUT WE'RE EVALUATING ALL THOSE SORTS OF THINGS AS WELL AND THOSE ARE CRITERIA- THAT WE HAD THE FIRST TIME AROUND AND WILL CONTINUE WORKING FOR WOMEN IN LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT WE'RE CONTINUING AND EXPANDING THE PROGRAM. AND GIVEN THE FINANCIAL SITUATION THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS UP AND DOWN. THE STATE SEEM TO BE FINDING. I GUESS OF THEM. IN AT THIS POINT DUE TO THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC IN THE UNCERTAINTY. OF BACKUP FUNDING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OR OTHERWISE. WHAT'S YOUR PROJECTION FOR THE SUCCESS OF CONTINUED SUCCESS OF THIS PROGRAM THEN. WELL IT'S A THAT THERE'S STILL A SIGNIFICANT INTEREST IN THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL RIGHT AND THEY KNOW WHAT IT TAKES TO DO THESE PROJECTS WE ARE GETTING A LOT OF ENQUIRIES ABOUT IF WE CAN DO MORE OF THIS FROM OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT PARTNERS. SO TO SOME DEGREE THAT IS I THINK AN IMPORTANT DATA POINT FOR WHETHER THERE'S COMMITMENT I WOULD ALSO ADD THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF SOURCES COMING WELL OF COURSE THERE COULD BE MORE OVER THE PAST COUPLE YEARS WE'VE HAD A LOT OF RESOURCES CAN LOOK GOVERNMENTS PARTICULARLY FOR HOMELESSNESS. THAT THEY COULDN'T THEY HAD DID USE IN THE FIRST ROUND TO PARTNER WITH THE SIGNATURE COULD YOU STILL USE MOVING FORWARD WE HAVE ONGOING- WHAT WE CALL THE PERMIT LOCAL HOUSING ALLOCATIONS FROM SENATE BILL TWO A COUPLE YEARS GO THAT FLOW TO EACH AND EVERY GOVERNMENT THEY CAN USE FOR HOMELESSNESS WE HAVE. A WE'RE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO GET IN FUSIONS IN THE CARERS ACT OF ADDITIONAL ESG AND CBJ ARE PROGRAM DOLLARS THOSE OF COURSE CAN BE PARTNERED MANY MANY JURISDICTIONS USE THOSE MANY RICHER SECTIONS USED THEIR SHEEP AND HALF DOLLARS- WHICH WERE ADMINISTERED TO THE OUR AGENCY DID HOMES ACCORDING FIND A COUNSELOR THERE ARE A LOT OF RESOURCES THERE- THAT WERE PULLED IN THAT THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE PULLED INTO ATTEMPTING TO AT THEIR DISCRETION- AND WE- WE ANTICIPATE THOSE WILL STILL REMAIN RIGHT MANY. OF THOSE ARE ONGOING SOURCE OF THE FUNDS THAT THEY CAN. THE GREAT OBVIOUSLY YOU THOUGHT THROUGH THIS IT'S A SOUP PROGRAM. AND- THANK YOU THE PRISON. OF THE RESPONSE THANK YOU MANAGER. TURN THE OVEN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THIS IS AN AREA AND I MADE A NOTE OVER THIS SECTION. IN MY PAPERS HERE AREA REQUIRES INTENSE SCRUTINY. THIS IS NOT A NEW ISSUE IT'S BEEN AROUND A VERY VERY LONG TIME. AND THE STATE AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO IT I WOULD LIKE TO. SOME ASPECTS OF MODERN ART. WHEREIN THE ARTIST. SHE DIPS A BRUSH INTO A PACK CAN OR GRABS A HANDFUL OF PAINT AND THROWS IT UP ON THE WALL. AS WE HAVE. RESPONDING TO HOMELESSNESS BY JUST THROWING MONEY. AT IT AND THAT'S WHY YOU'VE GOTTEN SO MANY QUESTIONS HERE TODAY UP FROM THOSE THESE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. ABOUT HOW DO WE SEE IF THIS IS WORKING OR NOT THE RESPONSE OF THE MOST RECENT- COMMENTER WAS REAL AND ACTIONABLE. SO THAT'S WHAT WE REALLY HAVE GOT TO HAVE PEGGED IN. NOW CANNELLA HOSTED A AND THE OF THE OUT OF THE HOME KEY IS KIND OF A CORNERSTONE OF THE GOVERNOR'S APPROACH TO DEALING WITH HOMELESSNESS SOLD THIS IS OBVIOUSLY REALLY IMPORTANT. AT AND THE L. L. COMMENTS AS TO WHAT EARLY STATE ACTION PROVIDE SUBSTANTIAL ADDITIONAL BENEFITS NOW THIS IS TO THE POINT DO WE KEEP POURING MONEY INTO THIS OR DO WE JUST STAND BACK AND SAY WAIT A MINUTE WHERE ARE WE NOW. CHAU WHO WOULD BE DOING THIS INVENTORY OF THE SUBSTANTIAL BENEFITS WE WOULD DIRECT WHO WOULD BE DOING THE INVENTORY OF THE NEEDS IF YOU WILL FOR STATE ACTION AND I DON'T KNOW WHICH DEPARTMENT SHOULD GIVE US THAT THE THOUGHT BUT MAYBE YEAH. HOWEVER WOULD PICK UP ON I AM SUPPORTIVE DEPARTMENT ITSELF WOULD BE THE BEST. POSITIONED THAT HOW DO WE IDENTIFY. THIS AND COORDINATED MUCH BETTER THAN WE HAVE DONE IN THE PAST. I'M HAPPY TO WRITE A RESPONSE ALTHOUGH I DON'T REPRESENT EVERY ENTITY THAT THAT DATA IS INVOLVED CERTAINLY IN OUR HOMES IS CONTINUING I DO UNDERSTAND THAT- I'M IN A WEEK THERE IS A HEARING THAT WILL BE FOCUSING ON HOME BECAUSE OF RACIAL HEARING OF THE SUB COMMITTEES AND OTHER COMMITTEES IN THE SENATE- TO TALK ABOUT THE- ISSUE OF HOMELESSNESS SO THAT MAY BEA GOOD A GOOD FORM TO DO THAT. I A- IT FOR HOME KEY RIGHT WE ARE JUST GETTING THE PROJECT REPORTS- AND ANALYZING THEM FROM THE FIRST ROUND AND WE WILL HAVE A REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE BELIEVE. ALLEGEDLY REALLY IN APRIL SO- WE ARE VERY CHEN THE OUTCOMES HERE- THE EXTENT BY WHICH WE WERE ABLE TO PROVIDE HOUSING FOR SIX THOUSANDS OF OUR FELLOW YOU KNOW SIX THOUSAND PLUS OR HER ARE FELLOW CALIFORNIANS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS WERE QUITE PLEASED WITH. WE BELIEVE IT'S A CRISIS THAT REQUIRES IMMEDIATE RESPONSE AND I BELIEVE THAT'S. WHY YOU SEE A REQUEST FOR EARLY ACTION. WELL LET ME GO A LITTLE BEYOND THAT HERE AND THE- ARE ARE SUBCOMMITTEE AND ANALYSES HERE. IT MENTIONS AND THIS IS SOMETHING I'VE HEARD IN THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES AS WELL. LOW OCCUPANCY RATES AMONG LOOK AT LEAST UNITS. AND AS THIS IS A CORNERSTONE HOW CAN WE JUSTIFY CONTINUING TO PUSH MONEY OUT WHEN THERE IS A LOW OCCUPANCY RATE. AMONG AT LEAST UNITS I THINK THE PREMIUM IS ON THE AGENCY IN THE DEPARTMENT TO REALLY GIVE US SOME SPECIFIC. VERY SPECIFIC PLANS ABOUT HOW THE AND THE EFFICACY HOW WILL THIS RESULT RESULTS IN HIGHER OCCUPANCY RATES THE MEASURE RULES THAT WE SPEAK ABOUT A LOT. IT IS NOT A CONCERN THE TO ALL OF YOU THE LOW OCCUPANCY RATES. I'M SORRY SOLANO SPEAKING RIGHT NOW. OKAY SO THAT BRITNEY BUT IF YOU'D LIKE TO GO AHEAD AYE I BELIEVE THOSE COMMENTS ARE DIRECTED FOR- I KNOW IT'S CONFUSING ROOM KEY WHICH ARE DARK APARTMENT IS NOT ADMINISTER BUT THAT WAS THE LEASING OF HOTELS ARE LEASING RATES WILL HAVE TO YOU AND WE'RE FULLY YOU KNOW REFERRAL FULLY CONFIDENT AHEAD FOLKS DURING THE MARCH ON ROOM KEY I'M SORRY HOKEY- WHICH WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE TODAY THE NOTES IN THAT YOU HAD IN YOUR- YOUR AGENDA ARE ABOUT ROOM KEY WHICH WAS A DIFFERENT PROGRAM NOT ADMINISTERED BY- THANK YOU FOR. I CAN SPEAK ROKY. SOMETHING APARTMENT FINANCE. I JUST WANTED TO KNOW THAT PROJECT WILL BE SERVED OVER TWENTY THREE THOUSAND PEOPLE IN ROUGHLY. FIFTEEN THOUSAND ROOMS. IN THE OCCUPANCY RATES FLUCTUATE AS PEOPLE CYCLE THROUGH THE PROGRAM BUT AT ONE POINT ALL OF THOSE LINES WERE INDEED OCCUPIED. AND THEY CAN SEEM TO BE OCCUPIED ON ALL ON AN AS NEEDED BASIS. CURRENTLY TO STATEWIDE OCCUPANCY RATE IS ABOUT 70% WELL THAT DOESN'T GIVE ME MUCH COMFORT WHEN I READ HERE THIS ANALYSES INDICATING ALL OCCUPANCY RATES AND DO YOU WORRY AND YOUR AND YOUR OWN RESPONSE SIR. INDICATE THAT THERE'S AN EBB AND FLOW. OF EACH. AND I DON'T THINK THERE'S A AB AT LEAST IN TERMS OF THE HOMELESS POPULATION. FOR THE SHELTER LISH THAT USED TO BE A TERM FOR HOMELESSNESS. AND FELLOW. LAST QUESTION HERE THEN. WHEN DO WE EXPECT AN OVERALL ACTION PLAN ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT AREA FROM THE ADMINISTRATION AND OVERALL ACTIONABLE ACTION PLAN. IT'S ALSO DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I CAN TAKE THAT ONE TWO HCFC IS PREPARING TO VOTE ON THEIR TWO YEAR ACTION PLAN NEXT MONTH SO PERHAPS SOMETIME SHORTLY AFTER THEY AFTER THEY APPROVE THE PLAN IT'LL BE ABLE TO BE RELEASED. THANK YOU FOR. OKAY AND THAT'S OKAY. WHY I THINK THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED- TODAY ARE THE ISSUES THAT I HAD CONCERNED ABOUT- I THINK YOU. FOR PROVIDING ME A LIST OF THE OF THE- OF THE PROJECTS THAT WERE APPROVED- AND THE REASON I ASK FOR THE PROJECT LIST AS I WANTED TO GET A GOOD SENSE OF WHETHER THE RESOURCES THAT WE SPENT THE CASH MONEY. EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WAS SPENT- WHERE WE SPENT AND WHETHER IT- IF THEY WERE AREAS WHERE A MAJORITY THE MONEY WENT THOSE KINDS OF THINGS AND SELL OUT MY APPROVAL OF IT IS I HAD ONE PROJECT IN MY DISTRICT OF A MILLION PEOPLE THAT WAS- SUPPORTED IN IT WITHIN THE CITY OF SALINAS WHICH IS THE BIGGEST CITY. IN MY DISTRICT OF A HUNDRED AND SIXTY HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE- BUT I HAVE TWENTY SEVEN CITIES THAT ARE REPRESENTED EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE CITIES HAVE ADVISED ME THAT THEY HAVE A HOMELESS. POPULATION THAT THEY ARE UNABLE TO SERVE SO TWENTY SIX OF THE CITY'S DID NOT- WE'RE NOT ABLE TO PARTICIPATE AND I THINK THE REASON IS THAT THE RURAL AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITIES THAT DIDN'T HAVE THE WHERE WITH ALL TO IMMEDIATELY RESPOND. TO AN OPPORTUNITY THAT WOULD BENEFIT BENEFITTED THE RESIDENTS SO NUMBER ONE IS I'M CONCERNED THAT WE DON'T- WE DON'T. USE SPEED AS THE WAY TO GET MONEY OUT BECAUSE THEN WE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT- THE COMMUNITIES AND MAJORITY OF- LET ME JUST SAY THAT MY- QUICK PERUSAL. WITHOUT ADDING UP THE NUMBERS IS THAT A MAJORITY OF THE FUNDS WENT TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA- LOS ANGELES ORANGE COUNTY AND SAN DIEGO. AND THAT. AS I LOOKED THROUGH THE LAST THERE WERE VERY FEW- RURAL COMMUNITIES AND SO- IT IF WE'RE ROLLING OUT A PROJECT TO BE EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS I THINK IT MAKE WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THAT THERE MAY BE. OTHER NEED TO MAYBE IT'S A TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT OVER IT- PR. BUT THE OTHER THING IS THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT COMMITMENT- AND THAT WAS RAISED I THINK BY BY BOTH OF THE SENATORS HERE ON. ON THE DINER ALL OF US. AND AND WHAT HAPPENS IF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT CAN CONTINUE. TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES THAT ARE NEEDED IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN THESE THESE MOTEL ROOMS THAT ARE NOW- HOME KEY ROOM AND AN ICE THAT BECAUSE HAVING SERVED FOR FIFTEEN YEARS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT. WHENEVER THERE IS A DOWNTURN IN THE ECONOMY CITIES FELT IT WORSE THAN THE STATE IN THE COUNTY DID- AND AS A CONSEQUENCE THERE WERE TIMES WHEN WE CLOSED. ESSENTIAL SERVICES LIKE RECREATIONAL PROGRAMS AND LIBRARY SERVICES IN ORDER TO. FOCUS ON THE MAIN SERVICES WHICH WE ABSOLUTELY HAD TO PROVIDE WHICH IS FIRE AND POLICE AND- THIS WOULD BE ONE OF THOSE SERVICES. THAT IT AND QUITE FRANKLY BUT WE GOT RID OF WAS- EMERGENCY SERVICE PERSONNEL SO THAT WE HAD NO PERSONNEL IF WE HAD AN EARTHQUAKE A FLOOD. OR ANY OTHER NATURAL DISASTER IN OUR COMMUNITY BECAUSE WE COULDN'T AFFORD IT YOU TAKE A RISK AND THIS IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT IT'S LIKELY TO GO BY THE WAYSIDE OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT DOESN'T HAVE THE RESOURCES SO. I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE IF WE BUILD THESE PROGRAMS- ATM AND I. I APPRECIATE THE LIST THAT YOU READ OFF THE HEAT THE HOT- THE- S. S. B. TO OUR PROPOSITION TO THOSE ARE ALL STATE FUNDS.

NUMBER ONE. ALL COMMUNITIES HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ACCESS THE FUNDS. AND CAN DO IT IN A WAY THAT PROVIDES THEM WITH AN ALTERNATIVE NUMBER TWO THAT WE REALLY SET UP A SYSTEM SO THAT- THE NONPROFIT CAN TAKE OVER THESE. FACILITIES BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE EXPERTISE IN RUNNING THEM. UP AND CAN FUNDRAISEIN A WAY THAT'S DIFFERENT THAN BEEN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND- BUT I THINK IT'S A IT'S A IT'S A GREAT PROGRAM IT WAS A IT WAS A BRILLIANT- YOU SEVEN OF KERR'S MONEY. AND IT IT GAVE US THE OPPORTUNITY TO PUT PEOPLE INTO INTO ROOMS IMMEDIATELY AND GET HIM OFF THE STREET I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE ALL WANT WHICH I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT AS WE MOVE DOWN THE ROAD. THAT WE HAVE A PLAN AND IT WORKS HARD MEETING THIS WITH. THE HE BEEN HAPPY MONIES IN A WAY THAT THAT MAKES SENSE AND THAT- THAT DOESN'T.

PROHIBIT A NUMBER OF THESE PROJECTS ARE MOVING FORWARD WITH THAT- GRANT ALLOCATION AND SO I JUST WANT TO- PUT OPINION THAT AND SAY THAT- I'M TRYING TO GET MORE INFORMATION AS TO EXACTLY WHAT WHAT IT IS ABOUT THE PROGRAM THAT CREATES THE IMPEDIMENT.

A NEED FOR A CARVE OUT- AND IN- AND- IN ADDITION. BOB WHETHER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BROWNFIELDS REMEDIATION WHETHER THAT INCLUDES- THE KINDS OF PROJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN ABANDONED. AND BECAUSE THE DOWNTURN IN THE ECONOMY WHERE SOME INFRASTRUCTURE WAS PUT IN PLACE BUT NOT ALL OF IT AND IN ORDER TO START THAT BACK UP AGAIN- IS THAT PROJECTS ARE GOING TO NEED A LITTLE BIT TO HELP SOMEONE TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE RESOURCES IN THIS FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS.

HISTORICALLY RESOURCES IT FOR REPAIRS MAINTENANCE HAVE BEEN FROM ONE TIME FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES- THE PROGRAM'S OPERATING BUDGET CONSISTS OF A GENERAL FUND SUBSIDY AND RENTAL REVENUES BUT AND THERE'S AS LITTLE MONEY LEFT OVER TO DO SOME OF THE TO ADDRESS CRITICAL. REPAIRS OR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE NEEDS. I HAVE AN ANSWER QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. TANKERS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS. OHIO.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH. COMMITTEE COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. FIVE I HAVE- COMMENT MORE THAN A QUESTION WELL ACTUALLY I DO HAVE A QUESTION- I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY- I'VE HAD IT OVER THE YEARS THE OPPORTUNITY TO TOUR SOME OF THESE- MIGRANT- HOUSING CENTERS AND- I'M WONDERING IF- AT LEAST A COUPLE OF THEM HAVE WASTE WATER. TREATMENT FACILITIES BECAUSE THEY'RE AYE THEY'RE LOCATED AT AB RATHER ISOLATED AREA AND- AND THE COMPLAINT I GOT FROM THE MANAGER OF THE FACILITY WAS THAT IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO RUN A MIGRANT CENTER AND THEN RUN A RACE WATER TREATMENT FACILITY WHICH THEY HAD NO NO TRAINING OR SKILL FOR- AND LEARN EVERYTHING THAT YOU NEED TO KNOW TO COMPLY WITH STATE LAW AND THAT THE BETTER SOLUTION RATHER THAN FIXING IT DEFICIENT SYSTEM IS TO JOIN THAT NEIGHBOR SYSTEM. AND HAVE SOMEONE ELSE TAKE OVER THE RESPONSIBILITY I'M WONDERING IF THAT WAS INTO IT THAT WAS- A POSSIBILITY THAT THE CONTRACTOR THAT WAS HIRED TO DO THE ASSESSMENT- WITHOUT AN OPTION IT WAS GIVEN TO THAT CONTRACTOR COULD MY GUESS IS THAT. THE CONTRACTOR JUST LOOK AT WHAT EXISTED IN DIDN'T DIDN'T LOOK AT EFFICIENCIES OR DID AND DIDN'T LOOK AT- AT THE NEED FOR A CHANGE AND I WONDER IF YOU YOU YOU CAN ADDRESS THAT. WELL AND YOU ARE CORRECT WE DO HAVE THREE CENTERS THAT DO YOU HAVE- A DIRE NEED FOR REHABILITATION THERE SEWER AND WASTEWATER SYSTEMS I AM. MANY OF THESE ARE VERY REMOTELY pTHAT'S A POSSIBILITY WITH DEPENDS ON HOW CLOSE THEY ARE TO CONNECTING TO A SYSTEM AND WE HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING FROM ANY OF THE CONTRACTORS SEVEN SHARED THOSE TYPES OF CONCERNS WITH US- BUT- WE CAN CERTAINLY EXPECT THOSE OPTIONS. BUT YOU SEEMS TO ME THAT THEM TO THE EXTENT. IT IT IS. IT'S RARE THAT WE HAVE AS MUCH MONEY AS WE HAVE RIGHT NOW. NUMBER ONE WE'RE LOOKING FOR A ONE TIME. PROJECTS NUMBER TWO NUMBER THREE IS B. CENTERS. ARE VERY MODEST AND I'M VERY OLD AND- COULD REALLY USE SOME REHABILITATION INCLUDING WEATHERIZATION AND SOLAR PANELS THE KIND OF THINGS THAT MAKE THEM MUCH MORE EFFICIENT AND- RATHER THAN. JUST DO SOME COSMETIC WORK I THINK WE GOT A LOOK AT WHAT WOULD IT TAKE TO- TO FIX SOME OF THE- STRUCTURAL ISSUES LIKE THE WASTE WATER TREATMENT AND SEWER. AND IF IT'S POSSIBLE AND WHAT ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT THAT WOULD- WOOD ASSIST IN A CLIMATE WHERE DURING THE SUMMER IT'S REALLY HOT AND DURING THE WINTER I'S PRETTY DARN COLD. SO THAT MY TWO CENTS WORTH IS THAT IS THAT WE MIGHT WANT TO SPEND A LITTLE BIT MORE MONEY ON THIS- AND LOOK AT WHETHER THERE'S SOME SOME FIXES WE CAN MAKE THAT WOULD ACTUALLY HELP IN THE MANAGEMENT OF THE OF THE SYSTEM SO. HI THIS IS A HOLDOVER ITEM AND- WILL BE BACK IN TAKING A LOOK AT THAT APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY HERE TODAY. AND THERE WERE GOING TO MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER FOURTEEN WHICH IS HOUSING ON ACCESS STATE LANDS. THANK YOU MEGAN KIRBY AGAIN HERE DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR HOUSING POLICY EACH CD- THESE PROPOSALS WOULD PERMIT THREE MAIN THINGS WITH THAT THREE MAIN CHANGES TO THE EXERCISE PROGRAM- A- CLARIFYING AND PERMITTING OF COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT. AS PART OF THIS PROJECT- A SHIFT TOWARD CONSIDERING THE MOST POSSIBLE AFFORDABLE UNITS- VERSES EIGHT PERCENTAGE OF AFFORDABLE UNITS. A MINIMUM PERCENTAGE- AND THEN ALLOWING PHASE DEVELOPMENTS WHEN IT- ALIGNS WITH THE STATE'S SCHOOLS. THIS IS A HOUSING ON EXISTING PLANT. THAT'S CORRECT. COMMENT TO QUESTIONS. THERE ARE NO COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS ON THIS ONE THIS IS A HOLD OPEN ITEMS SO- WE'LL WE'LL SEE THIS AGAIN. MOVING ON TO OUR LAST ISSUE TODAY WHICH IS ISSUE NUMBER FIFTEEN THE LOW LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDIT. HI THIS IS ANTHONY ZERO I AM- WITH THE CALIFORNIA TAX CREDIT ALLOCATION COMMITTEE- T. CAC ALSO KNOWN AS A D. K. WE- IT MINISTER OF THE LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDIT PROGRAM FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THIS INCLUDES BOTH FEDERAL AND STATE TAX CREDITS. OF THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION THAT'S REFERENCE IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET- IS SPECIFIC 24% PROJECTS- AND JUST BY WAY OF REMINDER 4% PROJECTS. ARE PAIRED WITH TAX EXEMPT BONDS- ALLOCATED FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEBT LIMIT ALLOCATION COMMITTEE SO THAT'S SAID LACK- SOME BE USING THESE ACRONYMS- IN AB ONE OH ONE IN TWENTY NINETEEN. MADE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION AND STATE TAX CREDITS AVAILABLE 24% PROJECTS- NEW CONSTRUCTION AND- YOU KNOW TO SPUR THE PRODUCTION OF UNITS HOUSING UNITS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND HISTORICALLY THE BONDS WERE- YOU KNOW UNDER SUBSCRIBING THAT'LL DUE TO THE INFLUX OF THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION A LOT OF PROJECTS ARE- FILLING FINANCING GAPS AND THEY ARE. PRODUCING A LOT MORE NEW CONSTRUCTION UNITS THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND YES- BY WAY OF COMPARISON TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUT WE HAD SLIGHTLY OVER SEVEN. MOSTLY UNDER SEVEN THOUSAND UNITS- NEW CONSTRUCTION ON THE NINETEEN WE ABOUT SLIGHTLY UNDER FIVE THOUSAND JUST LAST YEAR WITH THE INFLUX OF THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION- WE WERE ABLE TO DO ABOUT THIRTEEN THOUSAND- TOTAL HOUSING UNITS- NEW CONSTRUCTION ON OUR 4% SITE. AND FULLY- UTILIZE THE FULL BUS FEDERAL BOND. CAP UP VERSUS LAST- TWENTY TWO AB EIGHT THREE YOU KNOW IN ORDER TO TOOK TO- KEEP THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION- YOU KNOW THEY REQUIRED THAT DETECT CANCER BLACK- A LINE BY WAY OF ADOPTING REGULATIONS- THAT FOCUSED ON YOU KNOW PRODUCTION AND COST CONTAINMENT- THROUGH MANY MULTIPLE MEETINGS OF PUBLIC MEETINGS- AND VERY TRANSPARENT PROCESS THESE REGULATIONS WERE ADOPTED LATE IN DECEMBER. OF TWENTY TWENTY. AND THEY ADDRESSED ALL OF THE ITEMS AB EIGHTY THREE REQUIRED- SO WE WANT TO- WE JUST RECEIVED APPLICATIONS- IN THE FIRST ROUND AND- JUST LIKE THE TV MENTIONED EARLIER YOU KNOW WE HAVE LIKE A TWO TO THREE TIMES. OVERSUBSCRIBED PROJECTS TO SUPPLY DEMAND- SO HAPPY ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS IF THERE ARE ANY THANK YOU VERY MUCH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. GIMMICKRY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WHICH IS LIKE TO ECHO THAT THIS IS A VERY VALUABLE RESOURCE THAT IS HEAVILY RELIED UPON- BY DEVELOPERS. AND IS GIVEN THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THESE INVESTMENTS- YOU KNOW KITTY TECH HAS BEEN TRYING TO POST A DETAILS AS TO HOW THESE. AWARDS ARE BEING MADE- AND IT'S POSTED ON THEIR WEBSITE AND BUT WOULD JUST LIKE TO NOTE THAT- IT INFORMATIONAL BE BASED UPON THE DATA THAT'S AVAILABLE AND SO BECAUSE THE TAX CREDITS ARE ALLOCATED. ON A CALENDAR BASIS- IT WOULD MEAN THAT THE FIRST YEAR WAS ALLOCATED A SENTRY IN CALENDAR YEAR TWENTY TWENTY SECOND YEARS NOW BEING ALLOCATED THIS YEAR. WITHIN A FEW WEEKS OF THE FIRST ROUND AS- MISTER ZERO MENTIONED AND THEN THE THIRD YEAR THAT RIVER CAUSING AND TWENTY TWENTY TWO. THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH. QUESTIONS ABOUT HELLO. NO COMMENT AT THIS TIME THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH- SENATOR NELSON DID YOU HAVE A QUESTION. HE THING NO NO FURTHER QUESTIONS- I GUESS THE ONLY QUESTION I HAVE IS AND I WOULD AND I WANTED TO MAKE SURE I UNDERSTOOD- WHAT WHAT DONE WHAT WHAT YOU SAID IN REGARDS TO. THE CHANGES IN THE REGULATIONS IS THAT YOU'VE DETERMINED THAT- THAT THE IMPACT IS POSITIVE AND THAT THERE ARE THE OUTCOME. FROM FROM MAKING THE SHIFTED AT THE CHANGE IN THIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN BENEFICIAL IN TERMS OF MOVING MONEY OUT AND HELPING MORE PROJECTS MORE MORE CONSTRUCTION. WELL LIKE I SAID THE TWENTY TWENTY WAS THE FIRST YEAR THAT WE HAVE TO FIVE HUNDRED MILLION TO MAKE AVAILABLE- DURING THAT TAIL END OF THE YEAR- THERE WAS. THEY WANTED ALIGNMENT AMONG THE TO COMMITTEES SELECT AND SHE KEPT. AND SOME OF THE ITEMS THAT THEY WANTED REGULATORY CHANGES. OR SPECIFIC TO LOCATION DEVELOPMENTS WHICH WHICH WAS ADDRESSED- YOU KNOW INCENTIVIZING LARGER PROJECTS MORE UNITS- AND EFFICIENT USE OF THE PUBLIC SUBSIDIES SO STATE TAX CREDITS AND THE BONDS. SO A LOT OF THOSE ALL OF THOSE ITEMS WERE TAKEN ACCOUNT AND I THINK THE EFFICIENT USE OF THE PUBLIC. SUBSIDY DOLLARS- WOULD SPREAD AMONG MORE PROJECTS AND THEREBY. YOU KNOW- INCREASING THE NUMBER OF UNITS STATE.VERY GOOD I REALLY A- THAT- IT IS IN THAT EXPLANATION BECAUSE I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE BEEN THE MOST CONCERNED ABOUT IS OUR OUR HOUSING RESOURCES GO OUT IN SO MANY DIFFERENT FORMATS THAT IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR DEVELOPERS TO BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO ACCESS TO GRANTS FOR AND ACTUALLY BE SUCCESSFUL IN RECEIVING. THE GRANT FROM THE STATE AND IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE FROM OUTSIDE OF THE STATE LOOKING AND SAYING I WANT I NEED SOME HELP BUILDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING- THE FACT THAT THERE MAY BE THESE GRANT POSSIBILITIES IN DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS AND THAT ALL LOOK A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT IS VERY CONFUSING IT'S ALL. IT'S ALL THE STATE AS FAR AS THEY'RE CONCERNED AND SO THE MORE THAT WE CAN- CREATE EFFICIENCIES THAT'S BETTER AND I'M REALLY GLAD TO HEAR YOU SAY THAT SO- THIS IS A HOLLOW OPEN ITEM THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE TODAY- AND THAT THAT CONCLUDES THE LAST OF OUR- OF. OUR OUR THE PROPOSED FOR DISCUSSION ITEMS WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO THE PUBLIC COMMENT REGARDING THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL FOR ITEM RELATED TO BOTH PART A AND PART B.
