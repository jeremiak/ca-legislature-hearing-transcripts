MADAM SPEAKER I RISE

00:59:26.296 --> 00:59:27.730
UNFORTUNATELY.

00:59:27.797 --> 00:59:30.199
TO OPPOSE THIS RESOLUTION AND

00:59:30.266 --> 00:59:31.634
WHILE I APPRECIATE THAT

MAY HAVE A DIFFERENT VIEW AYE I

00:59:34.637 --> 00:59:37.206
A SUFFER EVERY DAY THAT I HEAR

SUPPOSED TO.

00:59:39.175 --> 00:59:39.876
.

00:59:39.943 --> 00:59:41.711
HONOR.

00:59:41.778 --> 00:59:43.379
BECAUSE THE TRUTH IS LIKE ANY

00:59:43.446 --> 00:59:45.348
FORMER PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN

00:59:45.415 --> 00:59:47.183
WAS PRETTY COMPLICATED.

00:59:47.250 --> 00:59:48.885
UNLIKE EVERY FORM PRESIDENT HE

00:59:48.952 --> 00:59:50.320
DID A LOT OF THINGS THAT HAVE.

00:59:50.386 --> 00:59:52.288
REALLY LEFT A LEGACY FOR US IN

00:59:52.355 --> 00:59:54.357
THIS CHAMBER THAT WE'VE SPENT

00:59:54.424 --> 00:59:55.491
MONTHS IN YEARS TRYING TO AND

00:59:55.558 --> 00:59:57.226
YOU.

00:59:57.293 --> 00:59:59.228
LET'S NOT FORGET IT.

00:59:59.295 --> 00:59:59.829
SUPPORTED APARTHEID IN SOUTH

00:59:59.896 --> 01:00:01.864
AFRICA.

01:00:01.931 --> 01:00:04.167
IGNORED THE SPREAD OF AIDS IN

01:00:04.233 --> 01:00:05.902
THE EPIDEMIC THAT BECAME MAIDS.

01:00:05.969 --> 01:00:07.370
THEN HE CLOSED.

01:00:07.437 --> 01:00:09.339
STATE HOSPITALS.

01:00:09.405 --> 01:00:10.473
IT SERVE THE MENTALLY ILL WHICH

01:00:10.540 --> 01:00:11.507
LEADS THE NUMBER OF HOMELESS

01:00:11.574 --> 01:00:12.842
THAT WE SEE ON OUR STREETS TODAY

01:00:12.909 --> 01:00:14.610
SOMETHING WE DEAL WITH TIME AND

01:00:14.677 --> 01:00:16.045
TIME AGAIN AND THIS LEGISLATURE

01:00:16.112 --> 01:00:18.414
TRYING TO FIX.

01:00:18.481 --> 01:00:19.349
THE START OF THE WAR ON DRUGS

01:00:19.415 --> 01:00:21.250
SUPPOSEDLY.

01:00:21.317 --> 01:00:23.619
A WAR THAT WAS REALLY WAGED.

01:00:23.686 --> 01:00:26.055
ON PEOPLE WHO HAD.

01:00:26.122 --> 01:00:27.590
BASICALLY IN AND SOME OF OUR

01:00:27.657 --> 01:00:29.192
COMMUNITIES.

01:00:29.258 --> 01:00:31.794
FALLEN SICK WITH ADDICTION.

01:00:31.861 --> 01:00:33.229
IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE NOW WE TALK

01:00:33.296 --> 01:00:35.064
ABOUT SICK WITH ADDICTION ON

01:00:35.131 --> 01:00:37.934
THAT OPIOID CRISIS IN HEROIN.

01:00:38.001 --> 01:00:38.568
BECAUSE THE COMMUNITIES LOOK A

01:00:38.634 --> 01:00:40.570
LITTLE DIFFERENT.

01:00:40.636 --> 01:00:41.738
BUT IT WASN'T ANY DIFFERENT FOR

01:00:41.804 --> 01:00:43.306
OUR COMMUNITIES WHEN THAT WAR ON

01:00:43.373 --> 01:00:45.008
DRUGS STARTED.

01:00:45.074 --> 01:00:46.743
BECAUSE THAT CYCLE OF ADDICTION

01:00:46.809 --> 01:00:48.444
WAS STARTING LARGELY FROM PEOPLE

01:00:48.511 --> 01:00:49.879
DISTURBING THOSE DRUGS IN OUR

01:00:49.946 --> 01:00:51.114
COMMUNITIES AND NOBODY STOOD UP

01:00:51.180 --> 01:00:53.816
THEM.

01:00:53.883 --> 01:00:55.618
BUT THERE ARE NUMBER REASONS I

01:00:55.685 --> 01:00:56.886
COULD STAND IN AND RAIL AGAINST

01:00:56.953 --> 01:00:58.287
RONALD REAGAN I DO HAVE TO KNOW

01:00:58.354 --> 01:00:59.489
THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE MY

01:00:59.555 --> 01:01:00.890
DISTRICT WHO ARE HAPPY THAT HE

01:01:00.957 --> 01:01:02.358
PROVIDED AMNESTY FOR THEM.

01:01:02.425 --> 01:01:04.394
BUT THAT'S.

01:01:04.460 --> 01:01:05.828
THERE'S ONE REASON IN PARTICULAR

01:01:05.895 --> 01:01:07.630
BECAUSE I COME FROM WHERE I COME

01:01:07.697 --> 01:01:09.665
FROM AND THAT'S ORGANIZED LABOR.

01:01:09.732 --> 01:01:11.534
AND HERE WE ARE ON THE EVE OF A

01:01:11.601 --> 01:01:12.535
DECISION BY THE UNITED STATES

01:01:12.602 --> 01:01:14.270
SUPREME COURT.

01:01:14.337 --> 01:01:16.172
BUT THE RIGHT GLEEFULLY THINKS

01:01:16.239 --> 01:01:18.074
WILL DESTROY PUBLIC SECTOR

01:01:18.141 --> 01:01:20.209
UNIONS THE JANICE DECISION.

01:01:20.276 --> 01:01:21.778
IN WE KNOW THAT WHAT RONALD

01:01:21.844 --> 01:01:23.880
REAGAN DID ON AUGUST FIFTH

01:01:23.946 --> 01:01:26.349
NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE LED THE PATH

01:01:26.416 --> 01:01:27.417
TO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE LATER

01:01:27.483 --> 01:01:28.951
THIS MONTH.

01:01:29.018 --> 01:01:31.554
HE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY.

01:01:31.621 --> 01:01:33.756
NOT ONLY FIRED BUT BLACKBALLED

01:01:33.823 --> 01:01:36.225
ELEVEN THOUSAND WORKERS.

01:01:36.292 --> 01:01:37.827
AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL WORKERS

01:01:37.894 --> 01:01:39.662
WHO JUST WANTED THEIR RIGHT TO

01:01:39.729 --> 01:01:41.097
STRIKE FOR BETTER CONDITIONS AND

01:01:41.164 --> 01:01:43.066
BETTER PAY ON THE JOB.

01:01:43.132 --> 01:01:44.700
AS A RESULT EVERYTHING WE HAVE

01:01:44.767 --> 01:01:46.335
TO DEAL IN THIS.

01:01:46.402 --> 01:01:48.104
IN THIS CHAMBER AND IN THIS

01:01:48.171 --> 01:01:49.939
COUNTRY WHEN CORPORATE PROFITS

01:01:50.006 --> 01:01:52.175
ARE AT THEIR HIGHEST EVER TO TRY

01:01:52.241 --> 01:01:53.643
TO GAIN SOME SORT OF ECONOMIC

01:01:53.709 --> 01:01:55.144
EQUALITY.

01:01:55.211 --> 01:01:57.814
BECAUSE THE SLOW DESTRUCTION.

01:01:57.880 --> 01:01:59.348
A PUBLIC SECTOR AND PRIVATE

01:01:59.415 --> 01:02:01.084
SECTOR UNIONS IN OUR COUNTRY HAS

01:02:01.150 --> 01:02:02.652
LED TO A BROADER AND BROADER.

01:02:02.718 --> 01:02:04.854
GAP.

01:02:04.921 --> 01:02:07.023
BETWEEN THE HAVES AND THE HAVE

01:02:07.090 --> 01:02:09.125
NOTS THAT STARTED. THAT STARTED

01:02:09.192 --> 01:02:10.393
UNDER THE HAMMER A LOT RIGHT

01:02:10.460 --> 01:02:13.663
WHAT IS YOUR POINT OF ORDER.

01:02:13.729 --> 01:02:16.065
THE MEMBER IS SPEAKING ABOUT AN

01:02:16.132 --> 01:02:18.134
UPCOMING SUPREME COURT CASE

01:02:18.201 --> 01:02:19.802
WHICH HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH

01:02:19.869 --> 01:02:22.472
HONORING PRESIDENT REAGAN.

01:02:22.538 --> 01:02:24.307

BECAUSE OF INCOME INEQUALITY THE

01:02:32.682 --> 01:02:33.883

ATTACKS ON ORGANIZED LABOR THE

01:02:35.952 --> 01:02:36.919
CRISIS WE SEE ON PEOPLE'S

01:02:36.986 --> 01:02:39.155

COLLECTIVELY BARGAINED FOR THEM

WAS BECAUSE OF WHAT RONALD

REAGAN DID TO THOSE ELEVEN

01:02:44.427 --> 01:02:45.795

RELATES TO THE LABOR MOVEMENT.

01:03:56.265 --> 01:03:58.201
BUT I DO WANT TO EMPHASIZE

01:03:58.267 --> 01:03:59.902
THE ONE THING. THAT PRESIDENT

01:03:59.969 --> 01:04:02.238
REAGAN DID GET RIGHT.

01:04:02.305 --> 01:04:03.839
THERE'S THAT HE SUPPORTED AN

01:04:03.906 --> 01:04:06.175
INCREASE IN THE FEDERAL GAS TAX.

01:04:06.242 --> 01:04:08.177
THAT WOULD FUND HIGHWAYS BRIDGES

01:04:08.244 --> 01:04:10.746

MAGNIFICENT SYSTEM TO DETECT.

01:04:26.095 --> 01:04:26.696
THEN DEMOCRATS WOULD WORK ACROSS

01:04:26.762 --> 01:04:28.331
PARTY LINES TO INVEST IN

01:04:28.397 --> 01:04:29.365
