ASSEMBLY BILL FOURTEEN OH ONE BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN AND OTHERS AN ACT RELATING TO LAND USE THIS FRIEDMAN. THANK YOU MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. WE HAVE ALL HEARD OVER AND OVER AGAIN ON THIS FLOOR THAT TRANSPORTATION IS THE ONE AREA IN CALIFORNIA WILL BE GONE IN THE WRONG DIRECTION IN TERMS OF GREENHOUSE GASES IT'S ALSO THE ONE AREA WHERE WE'VE GOT IN THE WRONG DIRECTION IN TERMS OF CONGESTION. WITH AREAS LIKE I LIVE IN LOS ANGELES HAVING SO MUCH CONGESTION THAT SOMETIMES IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO GET AROUND AND FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING FURTHER AND FURTHER AWAY FROM WHERE THEY WORK IT BECOMES EXTREMELY PUNITIVE AN IMPACT ON THE QUALITY OF LIFE. IT'S ALSO A REASON PARKING IS ALSO IN CARS ARE ALSO ONE OF THE PRIMARY REASONS WHY IT'S DIFFICULT. TO BUILD HOUSING IN LOS ANGELES. I KNOW FOR MY YEARS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT THAT WHEN YOU GO TO BILL HOUSING REALLY OF ANY SCALE. THE FIRST THING PEOPLE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD SAY IS. WE DON'T WANT THIS HOUSING PROJECT BECAUSE OF THE- CONGESTION BECAUSE OF THE PARKING IMPACTS. WE ALSO KNOW THAT ONE OF OUR GOALS TO SOLVE ALL OF THIS HAS BEEN TO TRY TO REDUCE VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED. AND YET WE CONTINUE. CONTINUE TO PRIORITIZE. PARKING IN CARS EVEN AT THE EXPENSE OF HUMAN BEINGS. IN THE UNITED STATES WE DEDICATE APPROXIMATELY A THOUSAND SQUARE FEET OF LAND FOR EVERY CAR THAT WE HAVE IN THE COUNTRY. AT THE SAME TIME WE DEDICATE ONLY EIGHT HUNDRED SQUARE FEET OF HOUSING FOR EVERY PERSON WE HAVE IN THE COUNTRY. THERE ARE SOME REALLY ASTOUNDING FACTS IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY PARKING MANDATES HAVE LED TO AN ASTONISHING TWO HUNDRED SQUARE MILES JUST OF PARKING. THAT'S FOUR TIMES AS MUCH LAND AS THE ENTIRE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO. L. A. COUNTY HAS EIGHTEEN POINT SIX MILLION PARKING SPACES. AT THE SAME TIME WE ALSO KNOW THAT WE HAVE. PARKING SPACES THAT ARE NOT USED TO MY IN MY OWN DISTRICT OFFICE IN BURBANK. I HAVE A PARKING LOT THAT IS USED FOR MY BUILDING THAT EVEN BEFORE COVE IT WAS MAYBE MAYBE A TEN FILLED THROUGHOUT THE DAY. OF THAT CITY STORE REQUIRES ANY NEW HOUSING UNIT TO ROUTE TO PROVIDE AT LEAST TWO PARKING SPACES. EVEN THOUGH THERE'S EMPTY PARKING LOTS ALL AROUND THEIR DOWNTOWN AREA. FORTINO ONE IS A COMMON SENSE BILL TO ALLOW THE BUILDERS OF NEW PROJECTS TO ALLOW DEVELOPERS TO RIGHT SIZE THE PARKING FOR THEIR PARTICULAR DEVELOPMENT. IT ALLOWS THEM TO LOOK AT WHO THEIR CUSTOMER IS GOING TO BE OR THEIR TENANT IS GOING TO BE. AND DECIDE FOR THEMSELVES HOW MUCH PARKING THE NEED THE BILL DOES NOT DO THIS STATE WIDE IT DOESN'T NEAR OUR HIGHEST QUALITY TRANSIT PLACES WERE WE ARE ALREADY ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO WALK AND BIKE AND USE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION. AND MAKE NO MISTAKE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION DOES NOT WORK IN SPRAWLING COMMUNITIES WHERE PEOPLE HAVE AN ABUNDANCE OF CARS AND ABUNDANCE OF PARKING SPACES. IN ADDITION EVERY PARKING SPACE THE DEVELOPER BUILD ONTO A UNIT. ONTO THEIR PROJECT COSTS ANYWHERE FROM TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER UNIT UP TO SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER UNIT DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF CONSTRUCTION. THIS IS THE REASON WHY MANY HOUSING UNITS SIMPLY DO NOT CANCEL AND WHILE MANY OF OUR AREAS DEVELOPERS WALK AWAY. FROM BUILDING HOUSING. FORTINO ONE IS SPONSORED BY CALIFORNIA YIMBY SPUR ABUNDANT HOUSING LA IN THE COUNCIL FOR INFILL BUILDERS. IT IS SUPPORTED BY THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT COMMISSION SILICON VALLEY LEADERSHIP GROUP. BAY AREA COUNSEL CAL ASIAN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE THE NATIONAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL. CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION AND TRANSFORM. I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MS FRIEDMAN. MR BLOOM. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER- I'M VOTING FOR THIS BILL TODAY- BUT I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT WHEN THE BILL WAS FIRST HEARD AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT COMMITTEE I WAS UNCLEAR THAT ALTHOUGH I SUPPORT THE GOAL OF REMOVING EXCESSIVE PARKING REQUIREMENTS I FELT THE BILL STILL NEEDED MORE WORK AND- UNFORTUNATELY I BELIEVE IT STILL DOES- I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT. EQUITY AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE GROUPS HAVE EXPRESSED VERY WHAT I THINK ARE VERY LEGITIMATE CONCERNS ABOUT THE WAY IN WHICH AB FOURTEEN NO ONE. HAS APPROACHED THE REMOVAL OF PARKING REQUIREMENTS BUT I WANT TO BE CLEAR I FULLY SUPPORT REMOVING PARKING MINIMUMS. BUT I ALSO SUPPORT POLICIES THAT MAXIMIZE DENSITY AROUND TRANSIT AND THAT MAXIMIZE AFFORDABLE HOUSING PRODUCTION THESE ARE BOTH VERY VERY WORTHY GOALS THAT WE SHOULD ALL. SUPPORT AND THE KIND OF POLICIES THAT WE NEED TO INCREASE TRANSIT RIDERSHIP REDUCE AUTO DEPENDENCE AND ADDRESS THE CLIMATE CRISIS BUT DE LINKING PARKING REDUCTIONS. FROM THE DENSITY BONUS FRAMEWORK WHICH THIS BILL DOES MEANS THAT WE FAIL TO CAPTURE. THE VALUE OF ANY BENEFIT THAT'S CONVEYED WE MISS OUT ON THE PRODUCTION OF NEW AFFORDABLE UNITS AND FOREGO THE POSSIBILITY TO GET MORE DENSITY NEAR TRANSIT. AND I BELIEVE THAT'S A MISSED OPPORTUNITY IT'S ALSO. TO THE DETRIMENT OF HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM SUCH AS L. A. X. TRANSIT ORIENTED COMMUNITY PROGRAM. WHICH IS DELIVERED THOUSANDS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS NEAR TRANSIT IN THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS AS A TRADE OFF FOR LESS PARKING. SUPPORTING EQUITY AND INCLUSION WHILE REDUCING PARKING MINIMUMS WOULD BE A WIN FOR HOUSING AND THE ENVIRONMENT AND THAT'S WHAT I THINK WE SHOULD SEEK WITH THIS BILL. AND LEAVING THOSE BENEFITS BEHIND. UNDERMINE SOME OF THE VERY GOALS OF THE BILL. SO I AM BUT I VOTING FOR THE BILL TODAY BECAUSE I WANT TO ALLOW TIME FOR CRITICAL CONVERSATIONS TO TAKE PLACE THE AUTHOR VERY GRACIOUSLY HAS SAID THAT- SHE WILL ENTERTAIN THOSE CONVERSATIONS. OPPONENTS OF THE BILL SUPPORT REDUCE PARKING AS I DO. AND I BELIEVE THAT WITH SOME AMENDMENTS BOTH GOALS CAN BE ACHIEVED AND I HOPE TO SEE AN IMPROVED BILL OF- RETURNED AFTER IT'S BEEN AMENDED. I THINK IT IS FOR THE MISTER MURATSUCHI. YOU RECOGNIZED THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WANT TO APOLOGIZE IN ADVANCE TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM GLENDALE FOR NOT TO. TRYING TO. ASK THESE QUESTIONS MORE DIRECTLY AND SO I JUST WANT TO RAISE MY CONCERNS ABOUT THIS BILL AND PERHAPS WE CAN- CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION AS A SUSPECT SUSPECT THIS BILL MAY BE MOVING ON. ALL WHEN I WAS ON THE TORRANCE PLANNING COMMISSION I KNOW THAT WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME. YOU KNOW TRYING TO STRIKE THE RIGHT BALANCE BETWEEN YOU KNOW HOW MANY PARKING UNITS WERE PROVIDED IN A IN A DEVELOPMENT- WITH THERE WAS A LOT OF CONCERN ABOUT. YOU KNOW TRYING TO AVOID SITUATIONS WHERE WE HAVE SAID TO MANY CARS PARKED ON THE STREETS PART I. IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. AND. AND SO IT IT'S A- MAKES ME VERY CONCERNED THAT WERE BASICALLY PROHIBITING WHERE WE'RE TAKING AWAY LOCAL CONTROL FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. FROM PLANNING RESPONSIBLY PLANNING FOR THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS THEIR COMMUNITIES ARE. YOU KNOW AS SOMEONE WHO. YOU KNOW IS COMMITTED TO FIGHTING CLIMATE CHANGE AND I WANT TO ENCOURAGE PUBLIC TRANSIT JUST AS MUCH AS ANYONE. BUT YOU KNOW TO. IMPOSE A STATEWIDE PROHIBITION ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO BE ABLE TO RESPONSIBLE PLAN FOR THEIR PARKING NEEDS FOR DEVELOPMENT I'M CONCERNED THAT GOES TOO FAR. MR WARD YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND I WANT TO COMMEND THE AUTHOR AND ALL THE SPONSORS FOR BRINGING THIS MEASURE FOR ALL WITH AB FORTINO ONE WE'RE WOULD HOPEFULLY BE ABLE TO REFLECT SOMETHING THAT WE'VE ALREADY DONE IN THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO WHEN I WAS ON COUNCIL IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN. WE ACTUALLY PASSED DESPITE MANY OF THE SAME CONVERSATIONS AND OBJECTIONS A VERY STRONG OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO REDUCE OUR PARKING MINIMUMS WHAT THAT WAS FOUNDED ON WITH A COUPLE OF PRINCIPLES ONE PARKING IS EXPENSIVE AND IT ADDS ACOSTA DIRECTLY IS BEING PASSED ON TO CONSUMERS AND THE RENTERS. TO PARKING IS SURPRISINGLY OVER ABUNDANT WHAT WE SAW IN THE DOWNTOWN SAN DIEGO PLANNING AREA WAS THAT UPON A RESIDENTIAL PARKING SURVEY 30% OF THE UNDERGROUND PARKING TIED TO THE UNITS ABOVE GROUND WITH UNUSED UNUSED AND WHAT TWENTY THOUSAND PROBABLY CLOSER TO SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THOSE KINDS OF PARKING CONSTRUCTION COSTS. THAT IS SIGNIFICANT EXPENSE PASSED ON TO THE- RESPECTIVE OWNER PASSED ON TO THE RENTER SO WHAT WE CAN DO IS MAKE SURE THROUGH THIS BILL THE RETREATING PARKING WHAT IT WHAT IS WHICH IS A COMMODITY WHICH IS AMENITY WHICH IS A TWICE AND WE SHOULDN'T HAVE ARTIFICIAL MINIMUMS PLACED INTO ANY CODES RIGHT NOW. THAT ARE PUSHING SOME OF THE CHOICES BECAUSE SOME OF THOSE DON'T NEED TO BE USE THOSE COSTS DON'T NEED TO BE PASSED ON TO THE RENTERS IF WE MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ALLOWING THE FLEXIBILITY WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO FIND IS THAT THE DEVELOPERS ARE GOING TO ACTUALLY DECIDE MAYBE I DO WANT ONE UNIT PER BEDROOM MAYBE I WANT TO ACTUALLY REDUCE IT TO YOU KNOW ZERO FOUR POINT FIVE. BECAUSE THE CHOICE IS GOING TO COME DOWN TO THE RENTER OR THE CONSUMER AND THEY'RE GOING TO CHOOSE WHETHER OR NOT THEY WANT THAT UNIT BECAUSE IT MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE PARKING AND THEY MAY OR MAY NOT WANT TO ASSUME SOME OF THAT EXPENSE AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT AND THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OVER ALL OF OUR RESIDENTIAL HOUSING SUPPLY. YOU'RE GOING TO SEE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO MITIGATE AND POSSIBLY EVEN REDUCE SOME OF THE HOUSING COSTS. IT'S SO MANY CALIFORNIANS ARE PRESSURED WITH AND ALL CLOSE BUDGET SAYING THAT WE SAW. AFTER THAT LOCALLY INTO THE- EIGHTEEN. IS NEW CAN. GOING ON TO THE- FOR OUR MERGING- I WORK. COME OUT. NEW CAN. IN DOWNTOWN DIEGO. FOR SIXTEEN HUNDRED. A MONTH RENT. AND THAT WITH UNACHIEVABLE FOR SO MANY OTHER LIKE HOUSING TYPES IN THE SAME PLANNING AREA BEFORE THAT SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK. FOR YOUR ITEM. THANK YOU MISTER WARD MISTER KALRA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD IS ABSOLUTELY SOMETHING. THAT IS A DIFFICULT CONVERSATION THAT'S LONG OVERDUE- AND I ALSO SERVED. ON THE CITY OF SAN JOSE PLANNING COMMISSION AND THE CITY COUNCIL. AND THE REALITY IS THAT WE HAVE. TO GET. LAST AND PUT IN THE PAST OUR- ADDITION TO PARKING. AND YOU KNOW WHAT WHEN AND SALAS IS ACTUALLY COULD EXAMPLE OF NOT ONLY HELP THINGS WENT HORRIBLY WRONG BUT HOW THEY'RE TRYING TO FIX IT. OVER THE LAST DECADE OR TWO- OF YOU KNOW OVER THE COURSE OF THREE TO FOUR DECADES CALIFORNIA WENT FROM ESSENTIALLY A FARMING COMMUNITY TO THE THIRD LARGEST CITY IN THE STATE AND NOW THE TENTH LARGEST IN THE NATION. AND A LOT OF MISTAKES WERE MADE ALONG THE WAY AND MORE RECENTLY- WE'RE TRYING TO REVERSE ENGINEER THOSE MISTAKES. BUILDING HIGHER DENSITY ALONG TRANSIT IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT. NOT JUST FOR INCREASING ACCESS AND USAGE OF TRANSIT. NOT ONLY FOR CREATING HIGHER DENSITY HOUSING WHICH WE ALL KNOW WE NEED EVERY CORNER OF THE STATE. OF IT ALSO ENVIRONMENTALLY IN SAN JOSE BEEN ABLE TO PROTECT SAUDI VALLEY BY BUILDING MORE DENSELY ALONG TRANSIT CORRIDORS. IN OUR URBAN CORE AND EVEN THROUGH WHAT WAS FORMERLY ALL SINGLE FAMILY. NAKED SPRAWLED OUT NEIGHBORHOODS WERE ACTUALLY BUILDING. MORE DENSELY ALONG THE TRANSIT QUARTERS BECAUSE- IT'S QUITE SIMPLY THE RIGHT THING TO DO. AND THE OTHER DAY I WAS DRIVING ALONG- FIVE EIGHTY. PASSING ALL OVER A LOT OF THESE DIFFERENT TOWNS THAT HAD. AND PUSH FOR LOBBIED FOR THESE WONDERFUL BART STATIONS. AROUND THE BAR STATIONS. THERE ARE NO HOUSING. A THIS COMPUTER A LAW TRANS LINES THROUGH CALIFORNIA BUS ONE. THROW CAL. SO I ALWAYS HAVING FROM SO COUNCIL LOCAL CONTROL. BUT I'LL TELL YOU TRANSIT ORDERS ARE NOT A LOCAL ASSET THE REGIONAL- AND ONLY BUILD TRANSIT AND WE BUILT TO. DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES THERE'S A RESPONSIBILITY ON EVERY COMMUNITY BUT ALONG THOSE TRANSIT LINES TO DO THEIR PART. TO RELIEVE THE PRESSURE ON HOUSING IN OUR STATE AND IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND FOR THAT REASON I STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANKS KALRA MISSED NAZARIAN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER COLLEAGUES I VERY MUCH RESPECT THE AUTHOR OF THIS BILL AND I FEEL LIKE NINETY. OVER 95% OF THE TIME WE'RE VERY MUCH IN SYNC AND ALIGNED. AND THE VERY ARGUMENTS THAT WERE STATED RIGHT NOW BY COLLEAGUES FROM SAN JOSE OR SAN DIEGO OR OF LOS ANGELES AS WELL. I AGREE WITH. BUT IT'S VERY INTERESTING THAT THAT WE COME TO A DIFFERENT CONCLUSION. I DO NOT I I'M STRUGGLING WITH THIS BILL TO SEE HOW THIS WOULD INCENTIVIZE. MORE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO PROVIDE THE NECESSARY HOUSING. FOR CONSTITUENTS WHEN YOU ALLOW A DEVELOPER TO DO WHATEVER IT IS THAT THEY'REGONNA DO THEY WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT BECAUSE THAT IS HOW. THEY WILL PROCEED WITH THEIR WORK. AT IT WE HAVE PLACED REGULATIONS FOR REASONS AND SO IF WE WANT TO MAKE CHANGES TO THE WAY OUR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ADDRESS THE SHORTAGE OF HOUSING WE NEED TO LOOK AT INCENTIVES I WOULD HAVE SUPPORTED THIS BILL. OR I WOULD HAVE BEEN GREATLY COMFORTABLE WITH IT IF THERE WAS A FORMULA INCENTIVE ATTACHED TO CITIES TO ACCEPT THIS TO THEN GET CERTAIN TYPE FUNDING FOR MORE TRANSIT FOR MORE DEVELOPMENT OF TRANSIT HOUSING AND TRANSPORTATION IS COMPLETELY. INTERTWINED IN ORDER TO GET BETTER HOUSING ADOPTED WE NEED TO MAKE THE APPROPRIATE TRANSIT AND RAIL INVESTMENTS IN OUR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AND TO BE QUITE FRANK I WANT ONE ONE OF THE COMMENTS I DIDN'T COMPLETELY AGREE WITH. CHANGES IN SAN FRANCISCO OR SAN DIEGO CANNOT BE APPLIED TO PLACES LIKE LOS ANGELES. IT IS THE THESE ARE VERY DIFFERENT AREAS WITH DIFFERENT CAPACITIES AND DIFFERENT ISSUES- SO I RESPECTFULLY WILL BE LAYING OFF OF THIS BILL TODAY I HOPE TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR AND OUR COLLEAGUES TO BE ABLE TO COME TO A PLACE WHERE I CAN SUPPORT. BUT I JUST SEE TOO MANY CONCERNS WITH THIS AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST I HAVEN'T SEEN THIS IN ANY OF THE ANALYSIS BUT THE REALITY FOLKS IS MOST AMERICANS RELY ON THEIR- ON THEIR SINGLE FAMILY HOMES. TO BE THEIR MAIN INVESTMENT OVER 70% OF AMERICANS TREAT THEIR HOMES AS THEIR PRIMARY SOURCE OF INVESTMENT. WHEN WE MAKE TOO MANY CHANGES LIKE THIS IT WILL EVENTUALLY START ERODING. THAT INVESTMENT I AM USING THIS ONLY AS A LAST ARGUMENT BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE THE DATE ON THIS TO FEEL VERY CONFIDENT TO SPEAK OF THIS BUT BUT AFTER YEARS OF LOOKING AT HOW THINGS WORK I AM CAN THAT THIS WILL AN EVENTUAL WEAR AND TEAR ON PEOPLE SINGLE FAMILY INVESTMENTS AND THAT CONCERNS ME. THANK YOU. THE TECHNICIAN IS THERE AND SEEING NO OTHER MEMBERS SEEKING RECOGNITION ON THE BILL MS FRIEDMAN YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU I REALLY APPRECIATE ALL OF THE ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED I APPRECIATE THE ROBUST DEBATE I DID WANT TO JUST MAYBE ANSWER A FEW OF THE CONCERNS FIRST OF ALL. IN TERMS OF TRANSIT INVESTMENTS LET'S ALSO KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS BILL ONLY AFFECTS AREAS WHERE WE HAVE ALREADY MADE. AS A STATE NOT THE REGION MAJOR INVESTMENTS IN THESE COMMUNITIES AND IN THESE HIGH QUALITY TRANSIT AREAS. THE BILL DOES NOT TAKE EFFECT IN AN AREA WHERE WE THINK WE MIGHT ONE DAY HAVE HIGH QUALITY TRANSIT TAKES AFFECTED AREAS THAT RIGHT NOW. A VERY HIGH LEVEL HIGH QUALITY TRANSIT WHERE WE'RE TRYING TO ATTRACT PEOPLE WHO WANT THE KIND OF LIFESTYLE WHERE MAYBE. THEY DON'T OWN THEIR OWN CAR OR MAYBE THEIR FAMILY OWNS ONE CAR. AND YET MOST LOCALITIES STILL REQUIRE DEVELOPERS REQUIRED THEM TO ADD MORE PARKING THE MOST DEVELOPERS OFTEN- THEY THEY NEED. LEADING TO. DEVELOPMENTS THAT HAVE. HALF EMPTY QUARTER EMPTY PARKING LOTS OFTEN RIGHT ADJACENT TO COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS THAT MIGHT HAVE A PARKING USED DURING THE DAY BUT EMPTY AT NIGHT. COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE HAD PROBLEMS WITH SPILLOVER PARKING WITH AREAS THAT ARE OLDER MAYBE THAT DON'T HAVE AS MANY PARKING LOTS HAVE SOLD THOSE THEY'VE SOLVE THEM WITH BETTER PARKING MANAGEMENT. THEY'VE SOLVE THEM WITH BETTER TRANSIT. BUT AREAS THAT HAVEN'T HAD THE PUSH TO DO THAT. HAVE GOT US WHERE WE ARE TODAY WHICH IS AN UNSUSTAINABLE SYSTEM WE HAVE GROWING TRAFFIC CONGESTION GROWING POLLUTION BAD AIR QUALITY TERRIBLE LAND USE PATTERNS WE HAVE TWO LITTLE GREEN SPACE TOO LITTLE HOUSING BECAUSE WE DEVOTE SO MUCH OF OUR LAND SO MUCH OF A REAL ESTATE. TO AUTOMOBILES RIGHT NEAR WHERE WE HAVE MADE MAJOR INVESTMENTS IN PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION NOW. THIS IS NOT A RADICAL IDEA THIS IDEA OF NOT REQUIRING THESE PARKING MINIMUMS HAS BEEN DONE IT'S BEEN DONE IN SAN DIEGO IT'S BEEN DONE IN SAN FRANCISCO WAS RECENTLY DONE BERKELEY IT WAS DONE IN BUFFALO NEW YORK ALMOST TEN YEARS AGO. AND WHAT HAPPENED WHAT HAPPENED WHEN THEY DID THIS GRAND EXPERIMENT. MOST DEVELOPERS MANY DEVELOPERS STILL BUILT PARKING PEOPLE WHO ARE BUILDING MARKET RATE HOUSING OFTEN STILL BUILT THE SAME AMOUNT OF PARKING. BUT WHERE DID IT MAKE A DIFFERENCE BUILDING FOR THAT MISSING MIDDLE PEOPLE WHO WANTED TO BUILD THE STUDENT HOUSING PEOPLE WHO WANTED TO BUILD THE SMALLER STARTER APARTMENTS. THEY REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF PARKING. AND WERE ABLE TO RENT THOSE UNITS FOR LESS. COMMERCIAL DEVELOPERS STARTED TO GET CREATIVE AND WORK TOGETHER SHARE PARKING LOTS THEY STARTED SEEING A LOT OF THAT IN BUFFALO WE'RE TO DEVELOPERS WOULD SAY. WE HAVE TO LOCK WITH BILL ONE LOCKED TOGETHER FOR PARKING. AND BUILD MIXED USE WITH HOUSING. NOW IN TERMS OF THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING ARGUMENT. THE REASON THAT WE ARE ABLE TO GIVE DENSITY BONUSES TO DEVELOPERS IN EXCHANGE FOR THEM BUILDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS THAT BY GIVING THEM HIGHER DENSITY WE'RE ADDING VALUE TO THOSE LOTS. WHEN THEY BUILD MORE UNITS THEY FOREVER HAVE A HIGHER RETURN ON THEIR INVESTMENT THEY CAN RENT THOSE APARTMENTS OVER TIME. WHEN WE GIVE THEM PARKING REDUCTIONS WE HAVE NOT ADDED THE VALUE YES WE'VE REDUCED MARGINALLY THE COST OF BUILDING THOSE UNITS. BUT THEY KNOW. WHAT MARKET RATE DEVELOPERS KNOW WHICH IS THAT THOSE UNITS WILL RENT FOR LESS MONEY IF THEY DON'T HAVE THOSE TWO PARKING SPACES AND WE ALL KNOW THAT. SO OFFERING THEM JUST A PARKING REDUCTION HAS NEVER RESULTED AS FAR AS I COULD SEE IN ONE UNIT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THEY ARE TAKING A DENSITY BONUS FOR THOSE EXTRA UNITS THE PARKING REDUCTION IS OFFERED TO THEM TO SERVICE THAT HIGHER DENSITY ONLY. I ASK THE ADVOCATES SHOW ME A UNITS ONLY A PERKY A BUILDING. WHERE DEVELOPER ONLY TOOK THAT PARKING REDUCTION IN EXCHANGE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING THEY COULDN'T SHOW ME ONE EXAMPLE OF THAT BECAUSE THE PARKING REDUCTION IS NOT THE PRIZE THE PRIZE IS THE EXTRA DENSITY. AND WE STILL ALLOW THAT UNDER THIS BILL THOSE DENSITY BONUSES STILL EXIST AND WHAT SAN DIEGO SHOWED THAT THEY STILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT AND BUILT BUILT THEIR EVEN MORE AFFORDABLE UNITS. IN ADDITION. MANY OF THE SAME AREAS THAT HAVE HIGH QUALITY TRANSIT ALREADY HAVE INCLUSIONARY. ZONING ORDINANCES THAT REQUIRE AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN NEW UNITS IN NEW BUILDINGS. SO BY ALLOWING THE DEVELOPER TO REDUCE SOME OF THEIR COSTS BY REDUCING SOME OF THE PARKING. WE ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO GET MORE AFFORDABLE UNITS BECAUSE THEY ALREADY HAVE INCLUSIONARY ZONING REQUIREMENTS FOR INCLUDE FOR AFFORDABLE UNITS. I THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT POLICY I THINK THIS SHOWS OUR VALUE THAT WE'RE GOING TO PRIORITIZE PEOPLE OVER CARS AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL BILL IS ABOUT. THE BILL ABOUT USING LAND BETTER NOT DEVOTING SO MANY OCEANS OF CONCRETE TO THE AUTOMOBILE IT'S ABOUT TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE INVESTMENTS WE'VE ALREADY MADE IN HIGH QUALITY TRANSIT AND GIVING PEOPLE A CHANCE. TO SWITCH TO THAT AS OPPOSED TO ALWAYS HAVE A BELIEVING THAT EVERY SINGLE PERSON WHO LIVES IN OUR COMMUNITY WILL SHOW UP WITH THEIR OWN A CAR AND USE THAT AS THEIR PRIMARY WAY OF GETTING AROUND TOWN. MEMBERS WITH THAT I URGE AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU. OKAY WITH THAT CLERK WILL CALL THE ROLL. HE'S A VOTE. ALL MEMBERS OF. THE DESIRABLE. ALL MEMBERS VOTERS OUT OF A. MISS FRIEDMAN MOVES A CALL.

ASSEMBLY BILL FOUR BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER ARAMBULA AND OTHER AN ACCOLADE INFORMATICA. DR RABIA EMAIL. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. RACISM IS A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY WE PAINFULLY WITNESSED WHAT HAPPENS TO OUR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR TO OUR IMMIGRANT BROTHERS AND SISTERS WHO BORE THE BRUNT OF THE PANDEMIC. WHILE WE CONTINUE TO WAIT ON THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S TO PASS COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM WHICH HAS TAKEN TOO LONG AND PERPETUATE SYSTEMIC RACISM WE MUST ACT WITH URGENCY NOW. CALIFORNIA HAS A LEGACY OF LEADING BY EXPANDING HEALTH COVERAGE TO THOSE WHO ARE MOST VULNERABLE. IN TWENTY FIFTEEN WE EXPANDED HEALTH COVERAGE TO ALL CHILDREN IN TWENTY NINETEEN WE EXPANDED IT TO YOUNG ADULTS. AND NOW AB FOUR WILL CONTINUE IN THIS VEIN BY EXPANDING MEDICAID I'LL TO INCOME ELIGIBLE UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS. SIMPLY PUT THIS BILL ENDS THE EXCLUSION TO HEALTH CARE ACCESS DUE TO IMMIGRATION STATUS. BY REMOVING IMMIGRATION STATUS AS AN ELIGIBILITY BARRIER TO MEDICO CALIFORNIA CAN BUILD A MORE UNIVERSAL EQUITABLE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM FOR ALL WHO CALL THIS STATE HOME. NOW IS THE TIME FOR US TO BE ANTI RACIST TO BE INTENTIONAL AND TO INVEST IN ALL CALIFORNIANS THE CENTRAL NEEDS TO ACHIEVE EQUITY AND HEALTH CARE ACCESS. AFTER BATTLING THROUGH THE PANDEMIC OF THE CENTURY WE MUST PROVIDE THESE TAX PAYING CALIFORNIANS WHO HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO OUR ECONOMY AND SOCIAL FABRIC FOR DECADES WITH THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO BE SAFE AND HEALTHY. FELLOW MEMBERS WE INVEST IN THE HEALTH OF OUR STATE NGUYEN WHEN WE INVEST IN HEALTH COVERAGE FOR LOW INCOME UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS WHO ARE AN ESSENTIAL PART OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND OUR WORK FORCE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU DR RAMYA MISTER DAVID CHIU YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER LET ME START FIRST BY THANKING OUR PHYSICIAN CALLING FROM FRESNO. FOR HIS DOG LEADERSHIP ON THIS TOPIC AND I'VE BEEN A PROUD JOINT AUTHOR OF THIS BILL IN EVERY GENERATION SINCE HE'S INTRODUCED AT. TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO THE VERY FIRST LAWSUIT I'VE EVER WORKED ON WAS A CHALLENGE TO PROPOSITION ONE EIGHTY SEVEN. ONE AT THAT TIME THE PEOPLE OF OUR STATE AT LEAST A MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT IT MADE SENSE TO DENY HEALTH CARE TO FOLKS WHO BECAUSE OF THE VAGARIES AND THE UNFAIRNESS OF OUR IMMIGRATION SYSTEM- TO DENY THEM HEALTH CARE. AND I WOULD SUGGEST TO TWENTY FIVE YEARS LATER. THINGS HAVE CHANGED SUBSTANTIALLY NOT JUST BECAUSE WE'RE IN THIS MOMENT A PANDEMIC IN RECESSION WE'RE WE ARE SEEN THE IMPACT OF A BROKEN HEALTH CARE SYSTEM ON MANY OF OUR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES IN OUR STATE. BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT IF YOU LACK. DOCUMENTATION AND YOUR UNINSURED YOU ARE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO FALL ILL MORE OFTEN. TO DIE YOUNGER TO BE ONE EMERGENCY AWAY FROM FINANCIAL RUIN. WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE FOLKS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PROVIDING HEALTH CARE. IN THIS CONTEXT MAKE SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR STATE AND LOCAL REVENUES. PAYING OVER THREE BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR IN TAXES. AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PROVIDING ACCESS TO OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ACTUALLY PAID INTO THAT SYSTEM AND SO. I ASK YOU I ASK ALL OF US TO STAND UP FOR THE IDEA THAT IF WE REMOVE. IMMIGRATION STATUS AS AN ELIGIBILITY BARRIER TO MEDIC CAL NOT ONLY ARE WE BUILDING A FAIR SYSTEM. FOR THESE COMMUNITIES THAT WOULD RECEIVE HEALTH CARE BUT WERE ACTUALLY ENSURING THAT ALL OF US ARE SAFE FOR ALL OF US ARE HEALTHIER PARTICULAR DURING THIS TIME OF PANDEMIC WITH THAT. RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. MISTER SANTIAGO YOU ARE RECOGNIZED I THINK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS ALSO TO WANT TO THANK OUR COLLEAGUE FROM FRESNO AND ALL WHO HAVE ADVOCATED OVER THE YEARS. THE BRING FINALLY DIGNITY AND HEALTH CARE FOR A POPULATION THAT HAS WORKED EXTREMELY HARD EXTREMELY HARD TO MANY MANY OF OUR STORIES AND- OF US WHO ARE IN THE LEGISLATURE OR- WHO HAVE BEEN RAISED HERE WHO CAME FROM IMMIGRANT PARENTS WILL TELL YOU. THE LONG HOURS OF WAITING WITHOUT HEALTH CARE THE AMOUNT OF PAIN AND SUFFERING. WITHOUT THE ABILITY TO GET ANY ANY CARE LET ALONE QUALITY OF CARE MEDICINE OR OR BASIC STUFF THAT MOST PEOPLE TAKE FOR GRANTED. SO I'M NOT GONNA GO TOO LONG ON THIS OTHER THAN THIS OTHER THAN TO SAY THAT DOESN'T MEAN. THIS IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST MEANINGFUL THINGS THAT WILL VOTE ON THE LEGISLATURE. HI THIS YEAR AND I THINK OUR COLLEAGUES AND ALL WHO VOTE YES AND URGED FOR STRONG YES THANKS. THANK THIAGO. THIS PARA QUE AND YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS AND I RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB FOUR AND I JUST WANTED TO ADD SO MUCH OF WHAT OUR COLLEAGUES HAVE SAID ABOUT THE- THE OUTCOMES THAT THIS MAKES BETTER IN THE LIVES THAT ARE IMPROVED IS REALLY CRITICAL BUT I ALSO DON'T WANT TO FORGET THE COST SAVINGS THAT COME WITH THIS MEASURE FR EVERY DOLLAR WE SPEND PROVIDING PREVENTATIVE CARE WE SAVE FOUR DOLLARS DOWN THE LINE SO NOT ONLY IS THIS BETTER FOR CALIFORNIANS IT'S BETTER FOR A BOTTOM LINE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AMERICA. SEE NO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE DR RANDALL YOU MAY CLOSE IF YOU WISH. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER.

MISTER CHOW YOU MAIL BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS AB THIRTY FIVE WOULD REQUIRE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS TO DISCLOSE WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAVE A POLICY TO ADDRESS THE SPREAD OF MISINFORMATION THAT COULD ONE LEAD TO PHYSICAL HARM TO HAS VERIFIABLE IN AUTHENTIC CONTENT OR THREE DECEPTIVELY MANIPULATE OR DISRUPT THE BEHAVIOR OF USERS. SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS FORM AN INTEGRAL PART OF HOW U. S. ADULTS CONSUME NEWS ACCORDING TO THE PEW RESEARCH CENTER IN 202053% OF U. S. ADULTS GOT THEIR NEWS FROM SOCIAL MEDIA IT WAS REPORTED IN TWENTY NINETEEN THAT APPROXIMATELY 50% OF PEOPLE SHARE A NEW STORY ONLY TO FIND OUT LATER THAT THE NEW STORY WASFALSE. RECENTLY RESEARCHERS AT UC SAN FRANCISCO FOUND THAT AFTER THE TERM CHINESE VIRUS WE USED. WAS USED WHEN TALKING ABOUT COVERT NINETEEN THE NUMBER OF CORONA VIRUS RELATED TWEAKS WITHIN ANTI ASIAN PASSED TAX ROSE BY STOP API HE COALITION BETWEEN MARCH TWENTY TWENTY AND MARCH TWENTY TWENTY ONE THERE HAVE BEEN. OVER SIX THOUSAND HATE INCIDENTS NATIONWIDE TARGETING ASIAN AMERICANS AND PACIFIC ISLANDER INDIVIDUALS WITH 40% OF THOSE INCIDENTS TAKING PLACE IN CALIFORNIA SO THE NEXUS BETWEEN SOCIAL MEDIA AND MISINFORMATION IT'S QUITE EVIDENT. SOME MAJOR PLATFORMS HAVE MADE A GOOD FAITH EFFORT IN COMMUNICATING WITH THEIR USERS AND THE PUBLIC ON THEIR EFFORTS IN COMBATING THE SPREAD OF MISINFORMATION HOWEVER NOT ALL PLATFORMS ARE DOING THIS AB THIRTY FIVE REQUIRES SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS TO MAKE THOSE DISCLOSURES TO THEIR CONSUMERS. THE BILL DOES NOT DIRECT HALL PLATFORM SHOULD CURATE THE CONTENT IT ONLY REQUIRES PLATFORMS TO GIVE A DISCLOSURE AND MAKE IT EASILY ACCESSIBLE TO THE PUBLIC AB THIRTY FIVE IS NOT AN ONEROUS. REQUIREMENT ON PLATFORMS BUT IT IS THEY STEP THE RIGHT THE- IN. THE SPREAD OF MISS. WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE. THANK YOU MICHELLE. SAYING NO DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THE ITEM.

SO BILL FORTY EIGHT US MILLER GOODS AND OTHERS ACT RELATING LONG FOR. AS GOOD AS I YOU MAIL IN THANK YOU ASSEMBLY FORTY SEC MINUTE STANDARD ON LAUNCH USE OF SO CALLED LESS LETHAL WEAPONS LIKE RUBBER BULLETS AND TEAR GAS. INTO PROTESTERS LAST SUMMER OVER A HUNDRED PROTESTERS BYSTANDERS AND JOURNALISTS SUSTAINED SERIOUS INJURIES FROM RUBBER BULLETS AND BEAN BAG ROUNDS AT THE HANDS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT INCLUDING SEVEN PEOPLE WHO LOST AN EYE. IT IS CLEAR THERE'S NEED TO BE STRICT STRICT STANDARDS FOR USE OF LESS LETHAL WEAPONS FOR CROWD CONTROL AB FORTY CREATE STANDARDS THAT ONLY ALLOW TRAINED OFFICERS TO USE THESE TOOLS IF THEY ARE A THREAT TO SERIOUS INJURY TO INDIVIDUALS INCLUDING OFFICERS. OFFICERS BE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH DE ESCALATION TECHNIQUES ONE THE CROWD TO GIVE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO LEAVE THE SCENE THEY CAN ONLY USE THESE WEAPONS IN A MANNER PROPORTIONAL TO THE THREAT AND NOT INDISCRIMINATELY AGAINST A CROWD OR TARGETED AT THE HEAD OR NECK. THIS BILL SPONSORED BY THE CALIFORNIA FACULTY ASSOCIATION IS SUPPORTED BY A WIDE VARIETY OF SOCIAL JUSTICE GROUPS THE NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS ASSOCIATION COALITION UNIONS AND COMMUNITY ADVOCATES I ALSO WANT TO THANK PORAC IN THE POLICE CHIEFS WHOM I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH CLOSELY TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE NEUTRAL ON THIS BILL AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK I'M THROUGH THE PROCESS WITH A RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THEY WAS CONTROLS MISTER LUCKY YOUR RECORD. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS FIRST OF ALL OF BE VERY CLEAR ON THIS PARTICULAR MEASURE LAW ENFORCEMENT ONLY USES THESE TOOLS WHEN THEY ACTUALLY HAVE AN ATTACK OR THE RIGHT. THIS IS NOT JUST A DEMONSTRATION THIS IS NOT JUST TO PROTEST. AND I CAN TELL YOU IS. POSSIBLY ONE OF THE ONLY ONES IN THIS GROUP THAT ACTUALLY. FACED A SURGING GROUP OF PEOPLE THROWING OBJECTS AND ITEMS ASKED YOU TO CREATE A WHOLE DIFFERENT DYNAMIC THAN WHAT YOU HAVE SEEN. IN MANY OF THESE DEMONSTRATIONS THESE ARE CIRCUMSTANCES OF RIOTOUS BEHAVIOR AND ASSAULTIVE CIRCUMSTANCES FOR THE OFFICERS WHO HAVE BEEN CALLED TO THE SCENE TO PRESERVE THE PEACE. AND I CAN I CAN TAKE THEIR NUMBER THINGS ARE VERY VERY. UNFAIR IN THIS PARTICULAR MEASURE FOR EXAMPLE ONE OF THE- CHECKLIST ITEMS THAT YOU COMPLY WITH THERE MUST BE REPEATED ANNOUNCEMENTS ALONG FORSMAN INTENDS TO USE KINETIC ENERGY PROJECTILES OR CHEMICAL AGENTS IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES. NO I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY HOW YOU MEET THE CRITERIA AND HOW MANY LANGUAGES YOU HAVE TO COMPLY WITH IN ORDER TO MEET THE STATUTE. BUT I WOULD TELL YOU THAT- WHEN THESE CROWDS COME UPON YOU IT HAPPENS VERY VERY FAST. AND WHILE I WAS IN. THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE I ASKED. THE AUTHOR IF ROCKS WOULD BE JUSTIFICATION FOR USING THESE PRO DID THESE TOLLS AND I GOT AN UNCLEAR ANSWER I'M TELLING YOU. WHEN THESE OBJECTS ARE FLYING OUT TO. IT CREATES A DYNAMIC THAT YOU'VE NEED INTERVENTION YOU NEED TOLLS AND YOU DON'T WANT TO USE WEAPONS. RIGHT YOU WANT TO USE LESS LETHAL TOOLS WHICH IS OR WHAT. OUR QUESTION HERE. WHAT IN THE WORLD ARE WE DOING TO OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT IF WE PASSED MEASURES LIKE THIS TO ALLOW THEM TO PROTECT THIS. THAT'S WHAT I'M ASKING. I ASK FOR YOUR A STRONG NO VOTE ON THIS. MR SAY ARE TOWARD THE REAR OF THE CHAMBER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER TODAY I RISE IN OPPOSITION OF AB FORTY EIGHT. THIS BILL ENDANGERS BOTH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE CITIZENS THAT ARE CHARGED TO PROTECT. WELL SOME OF THE BILL'S REQUIREMENTS ARE REASONABLE SUCH AS REQUIRING LAW ENFORCEMENT TO ISSUE WARNINGS IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES BEFORE DEPLOYING TEAR GAS. THE BILL GOES WELL BEYOND REASONABLE REQUIREMENTS AND HAS REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE OVERLY DEMANDING AND TIME CONSUMING TO IMPLEMENT. THIS BILLS MANY REQUIREMENTS ALL EXCESSIVELY HINDER LAW ENFORCEMENT'S ABILITY TO RESPOND TO VIOLENT MOB AND PROTECT INNOCENT CITIZENS. THE SAN DIEGO POLICE DEPARTMENT RECENTLY ADOPTED ITS OWN POLICIES AND THIS BILL EXCEEDS MANY OF THOSE STANDARDS. WE SHOULD USE SAN DIEGO'S POLICY AS A CASE STUDY TO SEE pHOW EFFECTIVE IT IS BEFORE JUMPING AHEAD IN ADOPTING A STATE WIDE POLICY. WITH EVEN STRICTER REQUIREMENTS THAT'LL HAPPEN HAMPER ALL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. I HAVE SEEN SOME OF THESE RIGHTS. FROM THE BEGINNING AND IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THEY BE CONTROLLED FROM THE BEGINNING AND TAKING AWAY THIS VALUABLE TOOL FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT TO TRY TO DISPERSE CROWDS THAT HAVE GONE BEYOND PEACEFUL PROTESTING AND INTO RIDING. IS IT IS IMPORTANT FOR PUBLIC SAFETY. THANK YOU. I SEE NO OTHER MEMBERS. DR WEBER YOUR RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. I WASN'T PLANNING ON RISING- FOR THIS BILL- AND- AUTHOR DID A EXCELLENT JOB IN PRESENTING THE BILL AND THE REASONS WHY. THERE WAS A RIOT IN MY CITY- A YEAR AGO FROM SUNDAY- SOMETHING HAPPENED UNFORTUNATELY WAS AROUND THE SAME TIME AS GEORGE FLOYD. AND YOU KNOW I COME FROM A VERY SMALL CITY- LA MESA WITH HIGHER SELVES JEWEL ON THE HILL WELL TOWN. I BUT BECAUSE OFFICER SOMETHING THAT HE SHOULD NOT HAVE. THE RIGHT WAS A REGIONALES FOR SAN DIEGO CAME TO MY CITY. IT WAS HORRIFIC- IT STARTED OFF AS A VERY PEACEFUL PROTESTS BUT LATER IN THE EVENING PEOPLE CAME INTO THE CITY WITH OTHER OBJECTIVES. AND IT TURNED INTO A FULL SCALE RIOTS. I'M HAD THIS BILL BEEN AND AN AFFECTED PROBABLY WOULD NOT HAVE IMPACTED THE OUTCOME BECAUSE OUR POLICE OFFICERS DID WARN- THE RIOTERS. THAT THEY WERE TO DISPERSE- AND YET THEY STAYED IN UNFORTUNATELY THE ENDED UP BURNING DOWN SOME OF OUR BUILDINGS. BUT ONE OF THESE- PROJECTILE. WEAPONS WAS USED. AND HIT A WOMAN AND I. AND SHE IS BLIND IN THAT EYE. SO I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL BECAUSE IT IS IMPORTANT THERE ARE FEWTHINGS IN THIS BILL THAT ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. ONE IS TRAINING. YOU MUST MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE TRAINED TO USE THESE WEAPONS. THE SECOND IS THAT YOU SHOULD NOT BE INDISCRIMINATELY USING THESE WEAPONS AND THE CROWDS. THE THIRD IS TRANSPARENCY IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT IF AN ACCIDENT OCCURS. THAT THERE IS A REPORT MADE IMMEDIATELY AND THAT CITIZENS ARE AWARE. SO I RISE IN SUPPORT AS SOMEONE WHO WAS ON CITY COUNCIL WHO HAD TO DEAL WITH THIS SITUATION A YEAR AGO FROM SUNDAY. IT'S NOT EASY DEALING WITH RIOTS ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE PEOPLE COMING FROM OUTSIDE TO PURPOSELY DO DAMAGE TO YOUR CITY. I FELT FOR OUR POLICE OFFICERS THAT DAY BECAUSE THEY WERE BEING PLUMMETED FOR HOURS WITH ROCKS AND BOTTLES. AND SO THIS DOES NOT TAKE AWAY THEIR ABILITY TO USE IT IF NECESSARY IT PROVIDES MORE STANDARDS AND TRAINING AND TRANSPARENCY IN THE END. AND THAT IS WHY I SUPPORT THIS BILL. AND ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. DECADE AFTER WEBER MR WARD YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND I WANT TO THANK MY NEIGHBORS FROM SAN DIEGO AND FROM THE MESA FOR ALSO SPEAK AND MORE ELOQUENTLY THAN I COULD ON THIS BILL. ON BECAUSE THE DAY AFTER WE HAD OUR INCIDENCES IN THE CITY LIMITS THAT WE HAD IN MY DISTRICT THE CITY DOWNTOWN SAN DIEGO ANOTHER DEMONSTRATION THAT ALSO WAS LARGELY PEACEFUL. UNTIL THERE WAS AN AFFRONT UNTIL THERE IS A DECISION TO BE ABLE TO START ON LEASE. SOME OF THESE WEAPONS UPON THE CROWN. AND AS I ENGAGE WITH MY POLICE DEPARTMENT SINCE IT WAS BROUGHT UP HERE- BY AN OPPOSING SPEAKER. I'LL LET YOU KNOW THAT. THEY WERE FEELING A LOT OF DIFFICULTY UNDER THE PRESSURES THAT THEY RUN NO DOUBT. BUT FOR ME TO ADVOCATE FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO NOT ENGAGE NOT CROSS THAT LINE CERTAINLY STRUCK A NERVE FOR THEM AND I ASKED THEM. HOW MANY CITIZENS HOW MANY PEACEFUL PROTESTERS. WOULD BE APPROPRIATE COLLATERAL FOR THE RISK FOR THE THREAT OR THE POTENTIAL THAT YOU MIGHT BE TRYING TO BE ABLE TO PROTECT OUR HOLD THE LINE. THERE'S NO GOOD ANSWER FOR THAT. FROM THEIR PERSPECTIVE BUT I THINK THERE IS A GOOD ANSWER FOR THAT BECAUSE WE SHOULD NOT BE. FORCING SOME OF THESE CONNECTICUT JACK DIALS THESE RUBBER BULLETS CAUSING HARM. TO MOTHERS TO CHILDREN TO MEMBERS OF THE PRESS THE OTHERS THAT ARE THERE. PEACEABLE PEACEFULLY PROTESTING IN BEING A PART OF THAT MOMENT. AND TEAR GAS. MEDIAN BY THE GENEVA CONVENTION IN NINETEEN TWENTY FIVE. IS WHAT'S ON THE FLOOR APPEAR FOR DEBATE TODAY. TO WHAT STANDARDS DO WE HOLD OURSELVES HERE IN CALIFORNIA WHEN WE WANT TO SET THE STANDARD STATE WINE. AND I APPRECIATE THAT MUCH OF THIS WILL BE TALKED ABOUT WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND IN PARTNERSHIP TO BE ABLE TO GET THE DETAILS RIGHT BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE. THAT THEY HAVE THE TOOLS AT THEIR DISPOSAL WHEN THE TIME IS NECESSARY. BUT TO BE ABLE TO SET THE STANDARD HERE TODAY AND NOW N WITH A PART PARTICIPATION OF THE SENATE AS WELL. TO SAY THESE ARE EXPECTATIONS ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO HAVE LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY INTERACTION. WHEN THESE TENSE SITUATIONS ARISE. THAT WE WILL NOT MAIENSCHEIN. THAT WILL NOT CAUSE SIX NATION. THAT WILL NOT CAUSE ON JUST. BURDEN OF PEOPLE WHO ARE JUST AS- TO PEACEFULLY EXPRESS THE RIGHT TO PROTEST. I ASK THAT YOU GIVE THIS BILL A CHANCE AND YOU VOTE YES. ON SB FORTY EIGHT THANK. THANK MISS WARD MR MATH. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU. MISS SPEAKER MEMBERS I'D TO WAS NOT GOING TO SPEAK THIS BILL LISTENING AS FLOOR DEBATE I FEEL CAN TO. AS OF THE FEW THAT'S BEEN TRAINED BY ARM. BY OUR ARMENIA GUARD ON HOW TO HANDLE THESE RIGHT TYPE SITUATIONS. WHO HAS BEEN TRAINED ON LESS THAN LEE TOLLS. WHO HIS EXPERIENCE COMBAT. I THINK THAT. WE NEED TO REFLECT A LITTLE BIT MEMBERS. I REMEMBER MANY OF YOU. AFTER THE RIOTS IN DC AFTER THE STORMING OF CAPITAL GOING ALL MY GOD HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN. BUT NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TAKING AWAY A TOOL. IN OTHER TOOLS OUT OF THE TOOLBOX. FROM THOSE THAT PROTECT AND SERVE NOT JUST PROTECT AND SERVE OUR COMMUNITIES BACK HOME OF PROTECTING SERVICE HERE. AT THE STATE CAPITOL. YOU'RE TAKING AWAY A TOOL. THE TOLD FRANKLY A LOT OF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE OTTAWA VALLEY IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THESE THINGS HAPPEN IN SECONDS. IN SECONDS MEMBERS. HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE HAD TO MAKE A SPLIT SECOND DECISION. UNDER THESE TYPE OF CIRCUMSTANCES. WHAT DO YOU HAVE A MASSIVE CROWD COMING AT YOU. ANOTHER POINT. IN IN FRANKLY I'M SICK AND TIRED OF HEARING THIS ONE IN AND I'LL PROBABLY GET HEALTH FOR THE PRESS LATER BUT I DON'T REALLY CARE. I AM OVER HEARING ABOUT. THESE POOR PARENTS AND CHILDREN IN THESE PEOPLE THAT ARE IN THESE RIOTS WHAT YOU DECIDE TO BECOME A RIGHT YOU BECOME A COMBATIVE. YOU ARE ACTIVELY. A GRAPHENE. IN THE AREA. NO LONGER BEING PEACEFUL THIS ISN'T A PROTEST THIS IS A HOLDING THE SIGN UP. THIS ISN'T MARCHING AROUND. THIS IS THE ADDRESS OF THE ASSAULTING AN OBJECTIVE THAT IS WHAT WRITERS DO. STOP TRYING TO MAKE THEM SOUND. SITTING IN A SMOKE CIRCLE BEING PEACEFUL. MEMBERS WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A DUTY. AN OBLIGATION TO PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES. THAT THE PEOPLE THAT WERE TRYING TO TAKE THESE TOOLS AWAY FROM TAKE AN OATH. KISS THEIR FAMILIES GOODBYE EVERY NIGHT. EVERY DAY. TO GOING TO PROTECT YOU. TO PROTECT YOUR COMMUNITIES TO PROTECT YOUR FAMILY'S WHILE YOU'RE UP HERE. AND YOU WANT TO TAKE AWAY A TOOL FROM THEM. MEMBERS I'D ASK YOU TO VOTE NO. I THINK THIS MATHIS MISTER BRYANT IN THE REAR CHAMBER. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU COLLEAGUES. WHAT A HELL OF A FIRST BILL TO SPEAK ALL. I WAS INVOLVED IN A PEACEFUL DEMONSTRATION LAST YEAR. THIRTEEN FAIRFAX IN LOS ANGELES. MY PARTNER LAMAR WHO WALK DOWN THE FINAL OF CENTER OF THIS ROOM WITH ME JUST LAST FRIDAY. THAT WAS SWORN IN. THE PROJECTILES AIMED AT HER AS SHE WAS PUSHED TO THE GROUND AS WERE SWALLOWED BY BATONS AND OTHER THINGS WE WERE NOT RIOTERS OR LOOTERS BEFORE PEOPLE FRUSTRATED DISGRUNTLED LIKE MANY OF US IN THIS ROOM. THIS BILL DOES NOT TAKE AWAY A TOOL OUT OF THE TOOL KIT. IT RAISES THE STANDARD AND WE SHOULD RAISE THE STANDARD RESPECTFULLY I DISAGREE. WITH MY COLLEAGUES SUGGESTING THAT THIS IS MUCH LIKE A WAR ZONE. THESE ALL NEIGHBORHOODS THESE ARE COMMUNITIES THIS IS A COMMON SENSE PIECE OF LEGISLATION I THINK WE SHOULD TAKE IT EVEN FURTHER. BUT I'M URGING THIS ENTIRE ROOM TO VOTE YES AND I'M HONORED TO VOTE YES TODAY HERE MY FIRST DAY. AS A FULL FLEDGED MEMBER OF THIS ASSEMBLY THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER PRIME. SEEING NO OTHER MEMBERS SEEKING RECOGNITION. MS GONZALEZ YOU MAY CLOSE I DON'T KNOW IF I COULD- GIVE MUCH MORE THAN OUR NEWEST COLLEAGUE HAS GIVEN IN THAT BRIEF STATEMENT BUT I JUST WANT TO BE SURE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE VOTING ON NOTHING IN THIS BILL PROHIBITS THE USE OF LESS THAN LETHAL FORCE WEAPONS EVEN TEAR GAS WHICH I WOULD LIKE TO OUTLAW TO BE HONEST. BUT WORKING WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT IN FACT MY OWN POLICE CHIEF. PORAC THE UNION THAT REPRESENTS POLICE OFFICERS WE'VE TRIED TO ENSURE THAT IT IS DONE IN A WAY THAT PROTECTS PEOPLE AT A PROTEST. TO SUGGEST THAT YOUR PROTEST IN BECAUSE OF A THOUSAND PEOPLE AND SOMEBODY OVER THERE THERE IS A WATER BOTTLE NEAR A POLICE OFFICER THAT THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO SHOOT INDISCRIMINATELY RUBBER BULLETS ALONG THE ENTIRE CROWD IS RIDICULOUS I HOPE WE ALL BELIEVE IN THE FIRST AMENDMENT AND NOT. TO BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT RIGHT AND SHOULDN'T BE TARGETED BECAUSE SOMEBODY IN THE CROWD. HURLED A PLASTIC BOTTLE UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED LAST SUMMER. IT WASN'T JUST IN SAN DIEGO WE SAW IT HAPPEN TIME AND TIME AGAIN IN LA AND MY COLLEAGUE FROM SACRAMENTO IS HERE WE SAW A YOUNG WOMAN LOSE HER EYE HERE IN SACRAMENTO WE SAW JOURNALISTS GET SHOT IN THE GROWING QUITE HONESTLY I DON'T WANT TO KNOW WHAT HE LOST. IN LONG BEACH. THIS IS SERIOUS. AND THESE ARE NOT TARGETED AT INDIVIDUALS WERE NECESSARILY DOING ANYTHING WRONG. IF IN FACT SOMEBODY IS DOING SOMETHING WRONG A POLICE OFFICERS HAVE THE RIGHT TO USE THESE LESS THAN LETHAL WEAPONS AGAINST. THE INDIVIDUAL TO STOP THE CHARGE TO STOP BEING TARGETED. BUT THIS IS ABOUT PEACEFUL PROTESTERS PEOPLE WHO SHOWED UP TO EXPRESS THEIR FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS. AND CAN'T DO SO BECAUSE THEY'RE IN FEAR OF THEIR OWN LIFE FROM SOMETHING THAT QUITE HONESTLY COULD TAKE THEIR LIFE WE CALL THEM LESS THAN LETHAL. BUT WE KNOW THAT THEY'VE ACTUALLY CAUSED TO DEATH BEFORE. SO I FEEL LIKE THIS IS A BALANCE BILL. OBVIOUSLY I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. YOU BELIEVE THAT I I'M CREDIBLE TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEIR NEUTRAL PORAC IN THE POLICE CHIEFS. BUT IT'S TIME THAT WE INSURE THE PEOPLE STILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO SHOW UP AT A PROTEST IN NOT WORRIED THAT THEY'RE GOING TO LOSE THEIR AYE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MY RIGHT.

ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY SO BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND ACCOLADES PEACE ALL. IF YOU'RE HOLD YOUR RECORD. THANK YOU MANAGED MEMBERS TO I. PRESENTING A SIM BILL TWENTY SIX WOULD BE THAT SEEKS TO PROVIDE UNIVERSE MEASURE. THAT A STAB TO. ONE WHAT IT MEANS PEACE TO INTERVENE WHEN WITH A YOU OF FORCE. BY ANOTHER PIECE% OFFICER AND TWO SIR OUTCOME FOR PHIL TO INTERVENE. AND WORKING WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT PORAC SACRAMENTO COUNTY DEPUTY SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION AND OTHERS HAVE REMOVED HAVE MOVED TO A NEUTRAL POSITION. I LIKE TO THINK THE CHEER PUBLIC SAFETY AND MY GOOD FRIEND MY COLLEAGUE FROM PALMDALE FOR THEIR- INTERVENING. AND HELPING AND GIVING SOME DIRECTION AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS LEGISLATION. I ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. THANK YOU MR HOLDEN MR LACKEY ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS. AND I WOULD LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE- THE GREAT WORK IN THE OUTRAGE. FROM MY COLLEAGUE FROM PASADENA FOR WORKING WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND TRYING TO IMPROVE THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION BUT UNFORTUNATELY. I'M NOT IN A POSITION TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT I MEAN EXPLAIN YOU WHY. THE COUNTERS THAT INVOLVE THE USE OF FORCE FOR COMPLEX DYNAMIC. AND OFTEN VERY VERY TRAGIC. FOR THAT REASON EXISTING LAW ALREADY REQUIRES. DUTY TO INTERCEDE. FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS WHO ARE IN THE PRESENCE OF A USE OF FORCE BY REQUIRING AN OFFICER WHO FAILS TO INTERCEDE TO RECEIVE THE SAME PUNISHMENT AS AN OFFICER WHO USES THE EXCESSIVE FORCES AND FLEXIBLE AND ALSO MAY BE VERY UNFAIR. THE USE OF FORCE THAT COUNTERS ARE CHAOTIC CONFUSING. AND VERY DYNAMIC THEY HAPPEN VERY VERY FAST WHEN MULTIPLE AGENCIES ARE INVOLVED WHEN OTHER OFFICERS ARRIVED LATE AT THE SCENE THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO GATHER THE SAME INFORMATION. I SUPPORT DISCIPLINE OF OFFICERS FOR MISCONDUCT. INCLUDING THE CREATION OF A SYSTEM THAT INCLUDES THE POTENTIAL FOR DECERTIFICATION FOR NON CRIMINAL LACKS BUT I ALSO FOR A SUPPORT. ALLOWING A MEASURE OF DISCRETION THE TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE OFFICER'S RECORD. AND THE CIRCUMSTANCES FOR THE ALLEGED VIOLATION. THE REQUIREMENT THAT AN OFFICER WHO FAILS TO INTERCEDE RECEIVED THE SAME PENALTY BECAUSE THE OFFICER WHO USES EXCESSIVE FORCE IS TO INFLEXIBLE. INSTEAD WE SHOULD ALLOW POLICE OFFICERS. EMPLOY TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE FACTIONS. OF THE FAILURE TO INTERCEDE ON THE OFFICER'S PRIOR RECORD. AT OBJECTIVELY DETERMINE WHETHER DISCIPLINE IS REQUIRED. AND WHAT THE PROPER PENALTY SHOULD BE ALSO NOTHING IN THE BILL PROHIBITS US REQUIREMENT FOR THE SAME PENALTY FROM BEING ENFORCED RETROACTIVELY. TO EXCESSIVE FORCE OF FAIR TO INTERVENE IN SITUATIONS THAT OCCURRED PRIOR TO JANUARY FIRST I BELIEVE THAT'S VERY UNFAIR AND I URGE YOUR- NON SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER LACK SEEING NO FOR DEBATE ON THE MATTER MISTER WHO WOULD YOU TO CLOSE. THANK YOU SPEAKER. HI I'M A LITTLE BIT. THE BY THE- PRESENTATION BECAUSE IT WAS IN PUBLIC SAFETY THAT WE REMOVED ACCESSORY TO A CRIME. I WAS VERY CLEAR AT THAT POINT THAT THERE WAS AN ELEMENT OF THE BILL THAT WAS COMING OUT. FURTHERMORE THIS BILL CREATES. OPPORTUNITIES FOR. TRANSPARENCY THIS CREATES OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE PUBLIC TO UNDERSTAND AND ALSO FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO UNDERSTAND. THE PROCESS AND THE THINGS THAT ARE NECESSARY IN TERMS OF TRAINING THEY COULD BE CLEAR FOR THE PUBLIC TO UNDERSTAND AS WELL. SO EASY TO SAY THAT EXISTS. BUT IT'S NOT IN STATUTES. I THINK IT'S ALSO SAFE TO SAY THAT. WE HAD A DECERTIFICATION ELEMENT IN THIS BILL THAT WAS REMOVED. AND APPROPRIATIONS BECAUSE THERE'S ANOTHER BILL. DEALING WITH THE CERTIFICATION WHICH THIS IS LIKELY TO BE ADDED BACK INTO. SO I CAN SAY TO THE THINGS THAT WERE JUST PRESENTED BY MY GOOD FRIEND FROM PALMDALE. ARE NOT CORRECT. I WENT THE EXTRA MILE. AND I REMOVE A VERY CRITICAL PIECES OF THIS BILL THERE WERE CENTRAL. TO MEET IN THE COMMUNITY. AND ALSO ADDRESSING THE ISSUE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. HAVING AN ELEMENT OF THE BILL THAT WAS EVEN PUT IN BY LAW ENFORCEMENT SO THERE'S NO RETALIATION. AGAINST AN OFFICER. THAT CAME FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT IT MADE ITS WAY INTO THE BILL. SO I THINK WE WENT. THE EXTRA MILE. AND THEN SOME. TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WAS FAIR. BALANCED AND CREATED THE ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY THE PUBLIC IS LOOKING FOR- I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. CLERK WILL OPEN THE ROLE ALL MEMBERS THOSE WHO DESERVE. ALL MEMBERS VOTED TO THEIR TO THE. ALL MEMBERS RESERVE A.

MAKING THE ACT AVAILABLE TO ALL IS NOT ONLY THE MORAL THING TO DO. BUT IT IS ALSO ROOTED IN THE FACT THAT CALIFORNIA HAS SEEN SOME OF THE WORST RACIAL DISPARITIES IN TERMS OF CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS AND SENTENCES IN THE COUNTRY. IN FACT JUST LAST WEEK THE COMMITTEE ON THE REVISION OF THE PENAL CODE RECOMMENDED RETROACTIVE APPLICATION OF THE RACIAL JUSTICE ACT. AB TWO FIFTY SIX IS THE RACIAL JUSTICE OUT FOR ALL THAT PROVIDES THAT MECHANISM FOR A COURSE TO RECKON WITH PAST INJUSTICES FOR THOSE THAT CAN DEMONSTRATE THAT RACISM PAINTED THEIR TRIAL. THOSE WITH PRIOR RACIALLY BIASED CONVICTIONS AND SENTENCES DESERVE EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER THE LAW AND THIS IS A COMMONSENSE RECOGNITION OF HOW UNUSUALLY DIFFICULT IT'S BEEN FOR CRIMINAL DEFENDANTS. TO PROVE RACIAL BIAS WAS A FACTOR IN THEIR CASE. RECENT AMENDMENTS WERE TAKEN TO ADDRESS WORKLOAD CONCERNS FOR THE COURTS BY SETTING A DIGESTIVE BASIN FOR THOSE ABLE TO PETITION THE COURT FOR RETROACTIVE RELIEF. USING THE RACIAL JUSTICE ACT. WE'VE ALSO BEEN WORKING WITH THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL SAYS THE ARTS IMPLEMENTATION AND MAYBE TWO FIFTY SIX REFLECTS TECHNICAL AND CLARIFYING CHANGES. ALEX THE RACIAL JUSTICE ACT FOR ALL ANSWERS A SIMPLE QUESTION.

IN RECENT YEARS CALIFORNIA'S LED THE NATION IN THE AMOUNT OF WEAPONRY SECURED BY THE MILITARY FOR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT INVOLVING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THIS PAST YEAR CALIFORNIANS WERE SURPRISED TO SEE MILITARY EQUIPMENT IN ACTION DURING PEACEFUL PROTESTS TEAR GAS SPRAYED FOR MILITARY GRENADE LAUNCHERS RUBBER BULLETS SHOT FROM ARMORED VEHICLES THIS BILL CALLS FOR CITIES OR LOCAL GOVERNING BOARDS TO WORK WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. TO ESTABLISH MILITARY EQUIPMENT POLICIES WHEN IT COMES TO PROCUREMENT AND USE NOTHING THIS BILL WOULD RESTRICT ANY COMMUNITY OR POLICE DEPARTMENT FROM CARRYING ANY MILITARY EQUIPMENT THEY CHOOSE TO DO SO THIS BILL WOULD SIMPLY ENSURE THAT THE PUBLIC KNOWS WHEN MILITARY EQUIPMENT IS BEING USED ESPECIALLY WHEN PUBLIC DOLLARS ARE AT STAKE IN WITH THAT RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE. THANK YOU MR CHIU SEEING AND HEARING NO FURTHER DEBATE OKAY. MISTER SARATOGA. DURING THE LAST. OKAY HERE TO RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISS BAKER MEMBERS OF THIS FAMILY I STUNT FORTUNATELY STAND IN OPPOSITION TO AB FORTY ONE MILITARY EQUIPMENT COLLEAGUES IS SOMETHING THAT COUNTLESS AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS ACROSS THE STATE USE AN EMPLOYEE. JUST LAST MONTH I HAD THE PLEASURE OF BEING SHOWN SOME SURPLUS EQUIPMENT OVER CAL FIRE THAT THEY USED TO IMPROVE OUR AVIATION STRENGTH IN FIGHTING WIRELESS WILDFIRES. WHICH USED TO OBTAIN AND USE THESE TOOLS AND EQUIPMENT FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS BUT PRIMARILY DUE TO THEIR COSTS COMPARED TO THE MARKET. AND THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR SMALLER DEPARTMENTS. AND ALSO THE PREVAILING TO PARTY NEEDS FOR A REPAIRS. AS WE KEEP SHRINKING THE BUDGETS AN RESOURCES OF OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT BODIES. WE ASK THEM TO DO MORE WITH LESS. DEPARTMENTS OFTEN HAVE MERE HOURS TO RESPOND TO ITEMS GOING UP FOR AUCTION OTHERWISE THE ITEMS GO TO OTHER DEPARTMENTS ACROSS THE NATION WHO JUMPED FASTER. AB FOUR EIGHTY ONE SIMPLY GOES TOO FAR AND RAISE THE BAR TOO HIGH FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT BODIES TO EFFICIENTLY ACQUIRED THESE RESOURCES LET ALONE CONTINUE THEIR USE. GOVERNING BODIES ARE ALREADY HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE METHODS AND OVERALL IMAGE OF THEIR LAW ENFORCEMENT DEPARTMENTS TO WHICH IS BILL TRIES TO AMPLIFY. THEY ALSO PROUDLY DISPLAYED THESE ITEMS AND MANY OF THEIR COMMUNITY EVENTS FOR THE PUBLIC TO SEE. SO IT IS FOR THESE REASONS THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER SARATOGA'S THREE WACKY YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR COLLEAGUES. HELLO IN THIS LATE HOUR NOT REALLY- I RISE IN OPPOSITION OF AB FORTY ONE WHICHEVER WAY UNDERCUTS LOCAL CONTROL. THIS BILL AIMS TO RESTRICT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FROM PURCHASING EQUIPMENT THEY FEEL IS NECESSARY TO PROTECT THEIR COMMUNITY. THAT IS THE JOB OF LOCAL OFFICIALS TO APPROVE BUDGETS FOR THE VARIOUS AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS. HOW THE DEPARTMENT. HEADS SPEND THE BUDGETED REVENUES ARE BASED ON THEIR NEEDS TO PROVIDE THE COMMUNITY WITH THE BEST SERVICE POSSIBLE. LOCAL CHIEFS AND SHERIFFS ARE ACCOUNTABLE TO MAYORS VOTERS. RESPECTIVELY AND ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR KEEPING OUR COMMUNITY SAFE. BUT SHE CONTINUED TO BE ALLOWED TO MAKE DECISIONS IN THE BEST INTEREST. OF THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE. IF THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY DISAGREE. WHAT THE WAY THE COMMUNITIES ARE BEING SERVED THERE ARE ELECTORAL REMEDIES. CALIFORNIA IS A HUGE STATE IN A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH OFTEN DOES NOT WORK WHICH IS WHY THE CONCEPT OF LOCAL CONTROL IS SPELLED OUT IN THE STATE'S CONSTITUTION. THIS PROVISION IS BASED ON THE PRINCIPLE THAT THE CITY. RATHER THAN THE STATE. IS IN THE BEST POSITION TO KNOW WHAT OUR COMMUNITY NEEDS AND HOW TO SATISFY THOSE NEEDS TO LAST FOR YOUR OPPOSITION. THANK YOU MISTER MACINNES AGUIAR-CURRY YOU ARE RECOGNIZED HI DOUG THANK YOU VERY MUCH A MAN SPEAKER. I RISE TONIGHT JUST BECAUSE WE'VE HAD THE SIMILAR SITUATION IN MY COMMUNITY AND I SUPPORT- ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHOOSE BILL THEN YOU MIGHT ASK WHAT. THIS IS DOING SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY IPORTANT THAT MY COMMUNITIES DIDN'T DO IT ONE TIME AND I THINK IT REALLY ADDED SOME- STRESS AND DIGRESS WITH THE- POLICE FORCE. I THINK THIS BILL AND I KNOW THIS BILL TAKES NECESSARY STEPS TO INCREASE THE TRANSPARENCY AND REDUCE THE DEPLOYMENT OF MILITARIZED FORCES IN CALIFORNIA'S COMMUNITIES.

THERE WERE TIMES WHEN I'VE BEEN STUNNED AS I SAW LOOKED AROUND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AT SOME OF THE- MILITARY EQUIPMENT THAT WAS PURCHASED. IN THE FACT THAT LOCAL ELECTED STOOD NOT AND WERE NOT AWARE OF WHAT WAS BEING PURCHASED- IN THEIR DEPARTMENTS. AND SO I. APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR COMING FORWARD WITH THIS BILL. BECAUSE IT'S ESSENTIALLY JUST REQUIRES THAT THE LOCAL OFFICIALS BE INFORMED AND APPROVE OF- THE PURCHASE OF THIS MILITARY EQUIPMENT. IT IS SORT OF THE EPITOME OF LOCAL CONTROL THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

APPRECIATE THE WORK WE'VE DONE WITH OUR CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS TO INCLUDE AMENDMENTS TO STREAMLINE THE OVERSIGHT TO MAKE THE APPROVAL A ONE TIME ANNUAL PROCESS SO WHAT THAT MEANS IS. LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WORKING WITH THE POLICE DEPARTMENTS CAN ANTICIPATE WHAT MIGHT COME UP SO THAT WE'RE NOT STUCK IN A SITUATION WHERE THE POLICE DEPARTMENT WISHES TO PROCURE SOMETHING QUICKLY AT THE LAST MOMENT. SECONDLY THIS IS A BILL THAT IS ABOUT LOCAL CONTROL THIS IS SAYING THAT. AS LONG AS A LOCAL JURISDICTION IS WORKING WITH THE POLICE DEPARTMENT IN DETERMINING THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH EQUIPMENT WOULD BE PROCURED OR USED- ANY. POLICE DEPARTMENT CAN MOVE FORWARD WITH WHATEVER THEY WOULD LIKE TO SO WE'RE SIMPLY SAYING THAT AS LONG AS THERE IS ACCOUNTABILITY WITH THE CITY COUNCIL OR LOCAL GOVERNING BOARD. A POLICE DEPARTMENT CAN MOVE FORWARD ULTIMATELY THIS IS A BILL ABOUT HOW WE REBUILD COMMUNITY TRUST I KNOW FOR ALL OF US WHO'VE WORKED IN LAW ENFORCEMENT HOW IMPORTANT IT IS. FOR US.

ASSEMBLY BILL TUNNEL SEVEN BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER CARILLO AND OTHERS IMMACULATE VICTIM COMPENSATION THIS CARILLO Q. MAIL. THANK YOU MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I AM BEYOND PROUD TO PRESENT AB TENNELL SEVEN A MEASURE THAT WOULD RIGHTFULLY COMPENSATE PEOPLE SPECIFICALLY WOMEN WHO WERE INVOLUNTARILY STERILIZED UNDER CALIFORNIA'S PREVIOUS EUGENICS LOS AND THEREAFTER BY CREATING THE FORCED STERILIZATION COMPENSATION PROGRAM. YOU JANICE PRACTICES HAVE LONG A SHAMEFUL HISTORY IN OUR COUNTRY INCLUDING INVOLUNTARY AND FOR STERILIZATION BETWEEN NINETEEN OH NINE IN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE AT LEAST TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE STERILIZED UNDER CALIFORNIA'S EUGENICS LOSS MAKING UP ONE THIRD OF STERILIZATIONS NATIONWIDE ONE OF THE MOST COMPELLING CASES OF FORCED AN UNKNOWN STERILIZATION. IN THE LATE NIGHT HAPPENED IN THE LATE NINETEEN SIXTIES THAT L. A. COUNTY HOSPITAL IN THE DISTRICT THAT I REPRESENT IN WHICH MEXICAN AMERICAN AND IMMIGRANT LATINO WOMEN WERE STERILIZED WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT POST LABOR THESE WOMEN NEVER KNEW. WHY THEY CAN NEVER HAVE ADDITIONAL CHILDREN THE PAIN CONFUSION ANGER DEPRESSION AND MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES THESE WOMEN FACE IS DOCUMENTED IN THE FILM NO MATHIS NO MORE BABIES THESE THESE WOMEN ARE NOW ELDERLY AND LEAVING OUR WORLD EVERY SINGLE DAY. ALTHOUGH THIS HORRIFIC LAW WAS REPEALED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE I LATER STATE AUDIT RE-ATTEMPT FORTY FOUR WOMEN WERE STERILIZED DURING LABOR AND DELIVERY WITHOUT PROPER CONSENT WHILE INCARCERATED FROM TWO THOUSAND SIX. TO TWO THOUSAND TEN. DATING TO THE LATE NINETEEN NINETIES AN ADDITIONAL ONE HUNDRED WOMEN WERE INVOLUNTARILY STERILIZED IN PRISON DURING LABOR AND DELIVERY AS WELL AS A NUMBER OF FORCED STERILIZATIONS WERE PERFORMED DURING OTHER SURGERIES. IT IS CURRENTLY ESTIMATED THAT THERE ARE ROUGHLY THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THREE SURVIVING INDIVIDUALS. WHO SURVIVES STERILIZATION UNDER THE LAW AND TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR SURVIVORS OF PRISON STERILIZATION ABUSE THESE ABUSES ARE ALSO REFLECTED OF THE FILM BELLY OF THE BEAST. ONLY AFFECTED INCARCERATED WOMEN OF COLOR WITH 65% OF SURVIVORS IDENTIFYING AS BLACK HISPANIC MEXICAN OR OTHER. IT IS SHAMEFUL TO KNOW THAT EVEN TO THIS DAY MANY SURVIVORS STILL DO NOT KNOW THAT THEIR REPRODUCTIVE CAPACITY WAS VIOLENTLY STOLEN FROM THEM. FORCED AN INVOLUNTARY STERILIZATION HAS IMPACTED MORE THAN REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH IN SOME CASES THERE WAS EXTREME SIDE EFFECTS LIFELONG HEALTH COMPLICATIONS SOCIAL ISOLATION AND EVEN DEATH. MEMBERS THE FOR STERILIZATION COMPENSATION PROGRAM IS MORE THAN MONETARY COMPENSATION. IT PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK FOR OUT REACH IDENTIFICATION APPEALS PROCESS AND PAYMENTS MOST IMPORTANTLY IT OFFERS A SEMBLANCE OF JUSTICE THAT CONFRONTS CALIFORNIA'S SHAMEFUL PAST. AB TENNELL SEVEN WILL PROVIDE SOME CLOSURE TO THOSE HARM AND A GOVERNMENT SPONSOR STERILIZATION PRACTICE AND ENSURE THAT IT NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN. THIS IS THE FIRST STEP IN HEALING COMMUNITY AND GOVERNMENT RELATIONS AND ENDING THE PERPETUATION OF REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE INEQUALITIES. THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE INCLUDES THE RIGHT TO BE A PARENT TO BE A FATHER TO BE A MOTHER AND NO AMOUNT OF COMPENSATION WILL EVER MAKE THAT RIGHT BUT THIS. THIS IS ANOTHER STEP TOWARDS JUSTICE THIS BILL HAS NO OPPOSITION AND HAS RECEIVED UNANIMOUS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT AND I WANT TO THANK. ALL THE MEMBERS THAT HAVE BEEN SUPPORTED FOR THE PAST. FEW YEARS THAT I HAVE BEEN IN THIS IN THIS CHAMBER TRYING TO MOVE THIS FORWARD. AND AS WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS LEGISLATION I AM SO THANKFUL.

THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB TEN SEVENTEEN THE RIGHT TO REST ROOM ACTIVE TWENTY TWENTY ONE. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WE HAVE ALL USE THE RESTROOM ON THIS FLOOR MANY SEVERAL MAYBE MANY OF US SEVERAL TIMES TODAY. THE FIRST THING WE DO IN THE MORNING. AND IT'S THE FIRST THING OUR CHILDREN DO OUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY. BUT FOR MANY. THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE A RESTROOM. TO USE ANYTIME OF THE DAY. COVETOUS SHED LIGHT THAT MANY PEOPLE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO USE- RESTROOM. AT A FAST FOOD RESTAURANT AT A RETAIL PLACE. IN PUBLIC PARKS. AND AS I SAID LAST WEEK ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS GO OUTSIDE AND SEE MANY HOMELESS SITTING ON THE STREET AND JUST LAST WEEK AFTER I SPOKE ON THE FLOOR AND I WAS WALKING HOME. I SPOKE TO ONE GENTLEMAN NAMED DAVID. AND I SIMPLY ASKED HIM WHERE DO YOU USE THE RESTROOM. AND HE SAID ANYWHERE I HAVE TO BUT HE'S LEARNED TO TRAIN HIMSELF TO USE IT INFREQUENTLY. WHICH MATTER OF FACT. IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO ON THE KIDNEYS. THIS BILL IS SIMPLE IT WILL SIMPLY TAKE AN INVENTORY OF WHERE RESTROOMS ARE LOCATED FOR PUBLIC FROM CITIES TO COUNTIES. NOW BECAUSE OF COVED WE KNOW MANY RESTROOMS HAVE BEEN CLOSE BUT EVEN BEFORE THAT MANY MANY LOCAL JURISDICTIONS HAVE STARTED TO CLOSE THE RESTROOMS. BECAUSE OF ISSUES THIS DOES NOT ONLY PERTAIN TO HOMELESS. IT ALSO PERTAINS TO FAMILIES WHO WANT TO TAKE THEIR YOUNG CHILDREN TO PARKS IT ALSO PERTAINS TO FAMILIES WHO WOULD LIKE TO GO SEE. THEIR OWN CHILDREN PLAY SPORTS IT PERTAINS TO OUR SENIORS WHO WOULD LIKE TO SET OUT AT THE PARK. ALL OF US NEED TO USE THE RESTROOM MANY TIMES A DAY AND SIMPLY GOING OUT FOR A PARK DATE BECOMES VERY MINIMAL IF THERE'S NOT A CLEAN RESTROOM AVAILABLE. SO I STAND HERE AND ASK YOU TO SUPPORT AB TEN SEVENTEEN THE RIGHT TO RESTROOMS ACT A TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THANK YOU MISS CLARK SILVA THIS GONZALEZ YOUR RECOGNIZE THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER- I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL WE ACTUALLY EXPANDED IT WHICH IS RARE IN APPROPRIATIONS AND I'LL EXPLAIN WHY THIS IS NOT JUST A PROBLEM WITH HOMELESS IT'S NOT JUST A PROBLEM WITH. FAMILIES THIS IS A PROBLEM FOR WORKERS WE'RE HEARING MORE AND MORE STORIES OF WORKERS HAVE TO URINATE INTO A- A WATER BOTTLE BECAUSE THERE'S NOWHERE FOR THEM WHEN THEY'RE PROVIDING DELIVERIES OR OTHER THINGS TO USE THE RESTROOM QUITE FRANKLY- THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT THAT. IS A GENDER SPECIFIC AND THAT MEN HAVE AN ABILITY TO RELIEVE THEMSELVESIN A WAY WOMEN DON'T- IT IS AN ISUE THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS LONG TERM THE LACK OF PUBLIC BATHROOMS IN ASSESSABLE PUBLIC BATHROOMS IS AN ISSUE FOR ALL OF US. AND SO I REALLY APPLAUD MY COLLEAGUE FROM ORANGE COUNTY FOR TAKING THIS ON I DON'T THINK THIS IS THE LAST OF THE BILLS I THINK THIS IS JUST THE START TO UNDERSTAND. WHAT THE RIGHT TO USE RESTROOM SHOULD BE FUNDAMENTAL NO MATTER WHERE YOU WORK NO MATTER WHERE YOU PLAY NO MATTER WHO YOU ARE AND SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE NOT JUST FOR THE HOMELESS NOT JUST FOR FAMILIES NOT JUST FOR WORKERS BUT FOR ALL OF US. THANK YOU MISS GONZALEZ. HIS PARA QUE THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I'LL BE BRIEF BUT I WANTED TO THINK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL IN MY WORK AS AN ATTORNEY IN SAN FRANCISCO I REPRESENT HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE GIVEN CITATIONS FOR EXACTLY THESE KIND OF VIOLATIONS PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T HAVE A PLACE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM AND HAD NO CHOICE AND I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND THE RAMIFICATIONS OF THAT THEY THEN GOT A CITATION THEY COULDN'T PAY BECAUSE THEY ARE HOMELESS AND COULDN'T AFFORD IT A WARRANT WENT OUT. AND THEY THEN COULDN'T GET PUBLIC HOUSING AND CITIES HOMELESS PEOPLE WERE STUCK ON THE STREETS BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE ACCESS TO RESTROOM THIS IS SO KEY TO FIGHTING ARE HOMELESS PROBLEM SO THANK YOU.
