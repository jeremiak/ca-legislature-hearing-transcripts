AND THE IMPACT THAT WOULD HAVE MULTIPLIED ACROSS ALL TEACHERS AND SCHOOLS. ARE YOUTH DESERVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS WHERE THEY'RE SURROUNDED BY ADULTS WHO ARE TRAINED TO RESPOND TO THEIR MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS.

TWO TO THREE IS A REPEAT OF SB ELEVEN TWENTY SEVEN WHICH PASSED OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE LAST SESSION IT WILL HELP STUDENTS WITH SEVERE MEDICAL DISABILITIES ATTEND SCHOOL. THE ONLY MEDICATION THAT WORKS FOR SOME OF THE STUDENTS AND IS MEDICAL CANNABIS. THIS BILL WILL ALLOW A PARENT OR GUARDIAN TO COME ON CAMPUS TO ADMINISTER MEDICAL CANNABIS TO THEM IN NON SMOKING AND NON VAPING FORMS. MANY OF THE STUDENTS NEED TO TAKE A DOSE OF MEDICAL CANNABIS AT REGULAR INTERVALS WHICH OFTEN INCLUDES DURING SCHOOL HOURS CURRENT LAW DOES NOT ALLOW ANY FORM OF CANNABIS ON SCHOOL GROUNDS. THE STUDENTS MUST BE PICKED UP BY THEIR PARENTS AND TAKEN OFF CAMPUS. IN BY LAW THOUSAND FEET OFF OF CAMPUS IN ORDER TO RECEIVE THEIR MEDICINE WHICH IS VERY DISRUPTIVE TO THEIR LEARNING. SB TWO TWENTY THREE WILL ALLOW THE GOVERNING BOARD OF K. THROUGH TWELVE SCHOOL DISTRICT COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION OR CHARTER SCHOOL. TO CHOOSE WHETHER TO ADOPT THIS POLICY IS NOT A STATE MANDATE. DISTRICTS AND COUNTIES THAT OPT IN CAN OPT OUT AT ANY TIME FOR ANY REASON. INCLUDING IF FEDERAL FUNDING IS PUT AT RISK AS A RESULT OF THAT POLICY IN THIS POLICY. SB TWO TWENTY THREE REQUIRES THE STUDENT TO BE QUALIFIED. A QUALIFIED MEDICAL CANNABIS PATIENT WITH A DOCTOR'S RECOMMENDATION TYPICALLY THE MEDICINE IS ADMINISTERED AS OIL CAPSULES TEACHERS LIQUIDS OR TOPICAL CREAMS. THE BILL ALSO REQUIRES THAT A PARENT MUST ONE GIVE THE SCHOOL A COPY OF THEIR CHILD'S MEDICAL CANNABIS RECOMMENDATION TO KEEP ON FILE. SIGN IN WHEN THEY COME ON CAMPUS NOT DISRUPT THE EDUCATIONAL ENVIRONMENT AND TAKE ALL CANNABIS FROM SCHOOL GROUNDS AFTER ADMINISTRATION. WASHINGTON COLORADO FLORIDA MAINE AND NEW JERSEY HAVE ALL PASSED LEGISLATION ALLOWING STUDENTS TO USE MEDICAL CANNABIS ON SCHOOL CAMPUSES SB TWO TWENTY THREE IS A FIRST STEP. TOWARD ENSURING THAT STUDENTS WITH SEVERE MEDICAL DISABILITIES HAVE THE SAME ACCESS TO A QUALITY PUBLIC EDUCATION AS THEIR PEERS I DO HAVE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR -- OF YOUR WITNESSES MAY PROCEED TWO MINUTES EACH PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON SENATORS MY NAME IS KARENA MCKAY AND I'M HERE TO SUPPORT JUDGE SHOWS ACT AS P.. TWO TO THREE MY SON GIOVANNI JO JO JIMENEZ HAS USED DVD AND TEACH THE FOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS. SINCE THE AGE OF THREE MONTHS OLD HE HAS BEEN PLAGUED WITH EPILEPSY IN TWO THOUSAND AND THIRTEEN HE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH LETTUCE LENNIX BECAUSE THOSE SYNDROME. THIS KINDA EPILEPSY IS VERY RARE AND HARD TO CONTROL. JO JO WAS MEDICATED WITH HIGH DOSES OF PHARMACEUTICALS AND ALSO FIT IT WITH THE VNS VAGUS NERVE STIMULATOR. ALL WITH NO SUCCESS I WAS WATCHING MY SON DIE RIGHT BEFORE MY EYES I KNEW THERE HAD TO BE A BETTER WAY. I BEGAN RESEARCHING CANNABIS AND THE EFFECTS OF IT TO TREAT EPILEPSY AND CHOSE TO TRY IT AS OUR LAST RESORT. WE HAD TO GET WRITTEN APPROVAL FROM OUR OUR NEUROLOGISTS PRIOR TO SEEKING A MEDICAL MARIJUANA DOCTOR. THAT TREATED MINERS NOT ALL DO. FEBRUARY TWENTY FOURTEEN WAS THE FIRST TIME HE TRIED CANNABIS AND IT SEEM VERY HOPEFUL. DAY BY DAY I SEEN THEM EMERGE. AND START ENGAGING AGAIN FEATURES WERE DECREASED IMMEDIATELY. I SUPPORT THIS BILL TO TO JO JO NEEDING A DOES AT SCHOOL TWELVE PM DAILY. I FEEL CANNABIS SHOULD BE TREATED AS EVERY OTHER CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE ON CAMPUS. IT IS NOT FAIR THAT IT THIS MEDICINE AS SAVE MY SON'S LIFE. AND NOT BE GIVEN THE SAME TREATMENT AND AND ABILITY AS OTHER PHARMACEUTICALS ON CAMPUS. I LOOK FORWARD TO THIS BILL BECOMING LAW. LICENSE LIFE AND SO MANY OTHERS DEPEND ON IT. IN FIVE THOUSAND YEARS NO ONE HAS DIED FROM CANNABIS USE. IT IS THE ONLY MEDICINE THAT CAN STREET SO MANY DIFFERENT ELEMENTS ON SUCH A WIDE SPECTRUM FROM EPILEPSY TO ARTHRITIS TO CANCER. THE PARKINSON'S. IT ALSO HAS THE ABILITY TO REGENERATE BRAIN CELLS THIS HAVE SEEN FIRST HAND. I ASK YOU FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART TO GIVE A YES VOTE TODAY AND BE THE VOICE MY SON AND SO MANY OTHERS WOUND. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND YOUR COMPASSION. THANK YOU NEXT. GOOD AFTERNOON AUDIBLE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS MY NAME IS JENNIFER COMMISSION I'M A WIFE A MOTHER TO BEAUTIFUL FIVE YEAR OLD BOY NAMED ZACHARY OR Z. AS WE CALL HIM. AND I'M ALSO AN ICU NURSE TO THE LEVEL TWO TRAUMA CENTER IN SAN JOSE. I STILL BEFORE YOU LAST YEAR ON BEHALF OF MY SON AND OTHERS DIDN'T REQUIRE CANNABIS TO CONTROL DIFFERENT ELEMENTS. ZACHARY WAS DIAGNOSED WITH SEIZURES AT FIVE MONTHS OLD WE TRIED EVERYTHING THE DOCTORS HAVE RECOMMENDED AND EVEN ON SEVEN MEDICATIONS HE WAS STILL HAVING FORTY TO SIXTY SEIZURES A DAY. THEY WERE GETTING WORSE AND WORSE AND WE WERE TOLD EXACTLY WOULD NEVER WALK TALK AND YOU WOULD PROBABLY NOT MAKE IT TO THE AGE OF FIVE THE MEDS THAT DAY PRESCRIBE FOR HIM LEFT HIM LIFELESS HOLLOW AND STILL SEIZING. MY HUSBAND SAKE A SPECIAL ABOUT CANNABIS IN THE SUMMER OF TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN ASKED IF WE COULD TRY IT. I WAS COMPLETELY AGAINST IT AND THOUGHT HE WAS CRAZY. TURNER COLLEGES THAT THERE IS NOTHING REALLY LEFT TO DO AND SO TO GO AHEAD AND GIVE IT A TRY. WHEN WE STARTED IT TOOK A COUPLE OF WEEKS BUT WITH IN ABOUT TWO WEEKS WE SAW THERE WERE NO SEIZURES LEFT IN HIS EEGS OUR BRAIN WAVE PATTERNS STARTED IMPROVING? PRETTY QUICKLY THEREAFTER. HE'S NOW IN KINDERGARTEN HE JUST FINISHED HIS FIRST YEAR OF KINDERGARTEN -- THAT KID WHO SAID THEY WERE HE WOULD NEVER WALK OR TALK IS LEARNING TO WRITE HE CAN SPELL HIS NAME. HE'S SPEAKING. BUT THE MEDICATION THAT SAVED HIM THAT IS NOT ALLOW HIM TO DO ALL THESE THINGS. IS NOW FORCING HIM OUT OFTHE CLASSROOM BECAUSE OF OUTDATED INFORMATION -- THIS YEAR YOU HAD A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS OF SCHOOL. EVERY DAY WE GO TO SCHOOL TO PULL HIM OUT OF CLASS WALKING A THOUSAND FEET OFF CAMPUS AND GIVE HIM HIS MEDICATION AND BRING HIM BACK TO SCHOOL. DICKS IS ABOUT THIRTY MINUTES ON A GOOD DAY. THAT TIME IS 10% OF HIS TOTAL SCHOOL DAY AND IS EQUAL TO FIVE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED MINUTES OR NINETY HOURS OF SCHOOL TIME. THAT WAS JUST HIS KINDERGARTEN YEAR BY THE TIME YOU GRADUATE HIGH SCHOOL HE WILL LOSE ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED NINETY THREE AND A HALF HOURS OF SCHOOL. OR SEVENTY SEVEN THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND TEN MINUTES OF EDUCATION TIME. WHAT ELSE COULD HE HAVE LEARNED DURING THAT TIME? I THINK HE WOULD PROBABLY BE ABLE TO WRITE THE WHOLE ALPHABET NOT JUST HIS NAME. I HAVEN'T EVEN ADDRESSED THE OTHER TWELVE KIDS IN HIS CLASS THROUGH DISRUPTED WHEN WE COME TO PULL HIM OUT OF CLASS. WE ARE BEING FORCED TO CHOOSE BETWEEN HIS MEDICAL NEEDS AND HIS EDUCATION AS WELL AS HIS CLASSMATES EDUCATION. THIS IS UNCONSCIONABLE AND MUST BE CHANGED.

WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A FILE ITEM. TWELVE SB. ONE SIX SB SIX EIGHTY SIX FILE ITEM. TWELVE YOU MAY PROCEED WHEN READY. HI THANK YOU SO MUCH MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. FOR SAW IT ONE OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE WORK ON THIS BILL. AND FOR THE DETAILED ANALYSIS THIS IS A BILL THAT IMPLEMENTS -- BASE ESTABLISHES A PROGRAM IMPLEMENT COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTIONS TO IMPROVE OPPORTUNITIES FOR CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES LIVING IN SOME OF CALIFORNIA'S. MOST DISTRESSED NEIGHBORHOODS. HOW WE KNOW THAT GOD THAT THE CHILDREN LIVING IN THESE COMMUNITIES LACK ACCESS TO ADEQUATE HEALTH ACADEMIC AND SOCIAL PREPARATION -- OPTIONS THAT ARE NEEDED TO ACHIEVE SUCCESS NOW WE KNOW THAT. SOMETHING LIKE 70% OF CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN LIVING COMMUNITIES ACROSS STREET POVERTY. THAT'S NEARLY TWO MILLION CHILDREN LIVING IN POVERTY. AND WE KNOW THAT IT TAKES A HOLISTIC SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS THE IN THE IMPLICATIONS AND APPLICATIONS OF POVERTY -- FAMILIES NEED INNOVATIVE AND PRACTICAL APPROACHES TO HELP THEIR PROBLEMS AND SO I TO TWENTY TEN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION I STARTED TO WORK ON THIS ISSUE THE ESTABLISH THE PROMISE NEIGHBORHOOD PROGRAM. TO TRANSFORM SCHOOLS NEIGHBORHOODS IN -- INTO MINORITIES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY THROUGH A ROBUST SYSTEM OF COMMUNITY SUPPORT A HOLISTIC APPROACH -- BY WHICH FAMILY MEMBERS ARE INVOLVED IN THEIR CHILDREN'S ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE AND PROVIDING THEM WITH QUALITY SOCIAL AND EDUCATIONAL SERVICES. I IN CALIFORNIA ONLY -- WE HAD FIVE ESTABLISH AN OPERATING PROMISED NEIGHBORHOODS -- SERVING MORE THAN THIRTY THOUSAND STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES. ANNUALLY -- THESE NEIGHBORHOODS WORK TO ENSURE THAT ALL THE CHILDREN GROWING UP IN -- IN IN THESE ZONES HAVE ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY EARLY CHILDHOOD PROGRAMS SCHOOLS HEALTH SERVICES SOCIAL SERVICES RELIABLE SYSTEMS OF FAMILY COMMUNITY SUPPORT. THAT WILL PREPARE THEM TO ATTAIN AN EXCELLENT EDUCATION. AND SUCCESSFULLY TRANSITION TO COLLEGE AND CAREERS IN THE WHOLE IDEA IS IS THAT ALL THESE DIFFERENT -- SUPPORTS ARE INTEGRATED AND WORKING TOGETHER. AND THERE'S A KIND OF A HOLISTIC APPROACH -- TO ENSURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR PROMISED NEIGHBORHOODS VARIOUS METRICS ARE USED TO TRACK OUTCOMES THAT AND INCLUDING KINDERGARTEN READINESS PROFICIENCY IN CORE. K. THROUGH TWELVE SUBJECTS FAMILY ECONOMIC RESILIENCE IN SUPPORT FOR THE CHILD BECAUSE WE NEED TO GIVE. FAMILIES A SUPPORTIVE TO LEARN AND KNOW HOW TO HOW TO RAISE A KID AS A PROUD FATHER OF AN EIGHT MONTH OLD VERY FIRST TIME I'M I'M GETTING A CRASH COURSE IN -- AND ALL THE CHALLENGES OF OF OF OF PARENTAL PREP -- AND THEN OF COURSE YOU KNOW WILL ALSO NEED TO PROVIDE FAMILIES WITH THE INFORMATION THEY NEED. TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR KIDS HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTHY LIVING -- THERE'S BEEN GREAT TRACK RECORD OF EFFECTIVE AND ENCOURAGING OUTCOMES FROM OUR PROMISE NEIGHBORHOODS BOTH AROUND THE NATION IN THE STATE. LET'S TALK ABOUT CALIFORNIA HE WERE HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION RATES IN THAT ZONE OF SEPTEMBER WE HAVE RISEN. BY 15% OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS -- I KNOW THAT IN IN IN SAN FRANCISCO'S PROMISE NEIGHBORHOOD THIS AN EXTRAORDINARY GRADUATION RATES INCREASES AMONGST THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY -- THEIR GRADUATION RATES IN THE AFTERMATH COMMUNITY IN THE SAN FRANCISCO PROMISE ON ROSE FROM THE PROGRAM WHICH IS. PRETTY EXTRAORDINARY -- I NOW WEIGH PARTICIPATING HIGH SCHOOLS IN THE PROGRAM HAVE MORE THAN DOUBLE THE PERCENT OF STUDENTS WHO GRADUATE COLLEGE READY. SO THIS BILL CREATES A PROGRAM -- TO BE MINISTER BY THE CALIFORNIA PART OF EDUCATION. TO AWARD GRANTS TO UP TO TWENTY PROMISED NEIGHBORHOODS AROUND THE STATE TO IMPLEMENT -- PLACE BASED CONTINUUM OF CRADLE TO COLLEGE AND CAREER SOLUTIONS IN TARGETED HIGH NEED NEIGHBORHOODS -- THE PROGRAM INTENDS TO IMPROVE ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT COLLEGE SUCCESS CAREER READY MISS AND BUILD STRONG FAMILY. AND COMMUNITY SUPPORT SO I HAVE WITH ME TODAY DIXON SUNDERLAND -- USE FROM THE YOUTH POLICY INSTITUTE AND RICHARD WRIGHT FROM CALIFORNIA PROMISED NEIGHBOR NETWORK AND THEY'RE HERE TO TESTIFY IN IN SUPPORT OF THE YOUR WITNESSES MAY PROCEED TO MESSAGE PLEASE. I SAW -- DIXON SLINGERLAND WITH -- THE YOUTH POLICY INSTITUTE -- IN LOS ANGELES THE LOS ANGELES PROMISE NEIGHBORHOOD AS WELL AS REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA PROMISED NEIGHBORHOOD NETWORK MANY FOLKS IN THE ROOM. FROM THE FIVE PROMISE NEIGHBORHOODS THAT SENATOR ALLEN MENTIONED -- I JUST WANT TO REITERATE THE REMARKABLE RESULTS THAT ARE BEING ACHIEVED IN SOME OF THE MOST. SOME OF THE DENSEST HIGHEST POVERTY MOST IS IS MANAGED COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA -- THE POTENTIAL IS ENORMOUS TO REPLICATE AND EXPAND THIS MODEL WE'VE BEEN DOING IT NOW IN CALIFORNIA FOR OVER SIX YEARS. AS MENTIONED PRESIDENT OBAMA ESTABLISHES A SIGNATURE INITIATIVE ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO AND FIRST COMING INTO OFFICE. SO WE KNOW WORKS WE KNOW CALIFORNIA CAN DO IT WELL AND THIS IS AND THE LIFTING CHILDREN AND FAMILIES TASK FORCE IDENTIFIED PROMISE NEIGHBORHOOD IS ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS. TO EXPAND THE TWENTY LOCATIONS ACROSS THE STATE AND THAT'S WHAT SB -- SIX EIGHTY SIX WOULD ACCOMPLISH SO I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS RICHARD PRYOR I'M THE DIRECTOR OF MISSION PROMISE NEIGHBORHOOD. THE MISSION DISTRICT DISTRICT IS A TRADITIONALLY WORKING CLASS COMMUNITY IN SAN FRANCISCO. OVER THE LAST DECADE WE'VE SEEN EIGHT THOUSAND WORKING CLASS LOW INCOME RESIDENTS DISPLACED FROM THE COMMUNITY. RENT FOR A TWO BEDROOM APARTMENT HAS RISEN TO FORTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER MONTH. CAUSING MANY FAMILIES TO TRIPLE UP IN OVERCROWDED APARTMENTS AND FOR SOME DISPLAY STUDENTS. TO COMMUTE FROM CITIES ACROSS THE BAY. THESE AND OTHER CHALLENGES HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO LOW ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE. SIX YEARS AGO OUR PROMISE NEIGHBORHOOD BEGAN TO WORK WITH MORE THAN TWENTY COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS TO PROVIDE WRAPAROUND SUPPORTS TO STUDENTS FROM CRADLE TO COLLEGE. AND TO CONNECT THEIR FAMILIES TO SUPPORT AS WELL. THE SCALE OF THE SOLUTION BEGAN TO MATCH THE SCALE OF THE PROBLEM. WE WORK WITH NINE SCHOOLS AND THREE PRESCHOOLS REACHING ALMOST EIGHT THOUSAND STUDENTS AFTER SIX YEARS. WE SAW GRADUATION RATES INCREASE FOR THE LATINO POPULATION. FROM 63% 288%. AND PRESCHOOL ASSESSMENT SCORES JUMP FROM 24% 88%. PROMISE NEIGHBORHOODS BREAKTHROUGH SILOS AND COORDINATE SERVICES. PARTNER SHARE DATA AND HOLD OURSELVES ACCOUNTABLE TO IMPROVING RESULTS. THROUGH RIGOROUS ANALYSIS AND PLANNING. THIS IS GOOD GOVERNMENT THE EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE USE OF PUBLIC RESOURCES. TODAY OUR PARTNER NETWORK HAS MADE FIVE THOUSAND CONNECTIONS FOR TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED FAMILIES HALF OF THESE CONNECTIONS HAVE BEEN FOR HOUSING AND FINANCIAL ASSET BUILDING SERVICES. BUT OTHER REFERRALS INCLUDE MENTAL HEALTH LEGAL SERVICES AND MORE. EXPANDING THIS MODEL TO MORE COMMUNITIES COULD BE TRANSFORMATIVE FOR CALIFORNIA BY PREPARING OUR CHILDREN. TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE ECONOMY AND BY HELPING FAMILIES MOVE OUT OF POVERTY. THERE ARE COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE THAT HAVE EXPRESSED INTEREST IN THIS MODEL. WITH TWENTY PROMISE NEIGHBORHOOD STRATEGICALLY LOCATED LOCATED ACROSS CALIFORNIA THE SCALE OF THE SOLUTION. WOULD BEGIN TO MATCH THE SCALE OF THE PROBLEM. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU OTHERS IN SUPPORT. GILLIAN SPENT ON WITH THE MISSION ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AGENCY MISSION PROMISED NEIGHBORHOOD A SPONSOR AND SUPPORT.

FIVE FIVE FOUR ONE GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU ADJOURNMENT IN MEMBERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY FIVE FORTY ONE I JOINTLY AUTHORED WITH SENATOR PORTANTINO AS AMENDED THE BILL REQUIRES ALL KINDERGARTEN THROUGH TWELFTH GRADE PUBLIC PRIVATE AND CHARTER SCHOOLS WITH ENROLLMENT OF FIFTY OR MORE STUDENTS TO CONDUCT ONE LOCKDOWN DRILL OR MULTI OPTION RESPONSE DRILL PER SCHOOL YEAR. EXISTING EDUCATION CODE REQUIRES ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS TO CONDUCT FIRE DRILLS REGULARLY IN INTERMEDIATE LEVEL AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS AT LEAST TWICE A YEAR. HOWEVER EXISTING STATUTE DOES NOT REQUIRE TRAINING FOR ANY OTHER TYPES OF THREATS THAT MAY OCCUR ON A CAMPUS THAT MAY JEOPARDIZE THE SAFETY OF ALL ON CAMPUS. SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE TAKEN IT UPON THEMSELVES TO PROVIDE THIS TRAINING BUT IS CRITICAL FOR ALL OF OUR SCHOOLS AND CHILDREN SHOULD BE PREPARED. FOR EVERY SITUATION LAST YEAR WE DID HAVE TREMENDOUS STRIDES ARE MADE HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE TO ADDRESS SCHOOL SAFETY BUT MEASURES LACKED A REQUIREMENTTO CONDUCT THE LOCKDOWN DRILL SO I AUTHORED SB TWELVE OH THREE AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN THAT DID PASS THIS COMMITTEE ON THE SENATE FLOOR UNANIMOUSLY. WITH BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. I. S. B. FIVE FORTY ONE IS NEEDED TO ENSURE ALL CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS ARE MEETING A BASIC STANDARD YOU HAVE ANNUAL WALK DOWN TRAININGS ON SIDE IN ORDER TO BE PREPARED AND WITH ME TODAY A SERGEANT DERREN. BROWN WITH THE ORANGE COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE AND HE WILL TESTIFY IN SUPPORT AND ANSWER ANY OUR TECHNICAL QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE [inaudible] WEBER C.. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I AM PLEASED TODAY TO REPRESENT ORANGE CANCERS DEPARTMENT IN SUPPORT OF SB FIVE FORTY ONE WHICH REQUIRES ONE LOCKDOWN DRILL PER YEAR IN ALL KEY THROUGH TWELVE SCHOOLS. WITH FIFTY STUDENTS ARE MORE IN MY CAPACITY AS A SERGEANT WITH THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT I OVERSEE THE SCHOOL MOBILE ASSESSMENT AND RESOURCE TEAM ALSO KNOWN AS SMART. THIS UNIT RESPONSE ALL INCIDENTS RELATED TO VIOLENCE THREATS OF VIOLENCE POSSESSION AND OR USE OF WEAPONS UNSTABLE BEHAVIORS AND SORT OF SUICIDAL ACTIONS ARE TENDENCIES THAT POSE A THREAT TO OTHERS AT K. THROUGH TWELVE SCHOOLS. ORANGE CANCERS JURISDICTION. INCLUDES A LARGE SCHOOL DISTRICTS OF CAPISTRANO IN SADDLEBACK VALLEY IN PORTIONS OF MANY NORTH ORANGE COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICTS. I SUPERVISE ALL OF OUR SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICERS AND DALY INTERACT WITH OUR EDUCATION PARTNERS. THE EFFORT TO SMART AND SIMILAR INITIATIVES HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN IDENTIFYING AND ELIMINATING THREATS FROM TWENTY FIFTEEN THROUGH TWENTY SEVENTEEN SMART FIELDED FOUR HUNDRED SIX NINE CALLS FOR SERVICE. WHICH INCLUDED INVESTIGATING THREATS AS WELL AS INVESTIGATING REPORTS OF WEAPONS ON CAMPUS AND OTHER ILLEGAL ACTIVITY. THE TEAM MADE A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THREE ARRESTS OVER THOSE THREE YEARS AND HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN OF THOSE STUDENTS WERE MANDATED TO PARTICIPATE IN ARGUED DIVERSION PROGRAM. EVEN WITH THE BEST OF EFFORTS AND SYSTEMS IN PLACE WE MUST ALWAYS BE PREPARED FOR THE WORST POSSIBILITY. PREPARATION MEANS PRACTICE STUDENTS FACULTY AND PARENTS MUST KNOW WHAT TO DO AND WHAT IT WHAT IS EXPECTED IN THE EVENT OF AN ACTIVE SHOOTER OR OTHER INCIDENT OF VIOLENCE OCCURS. REQUIRING ACTIVE THREAT DRILLS WILL SAVE LIVES. WE KNOW THE STRATEGY OF REQUIRED SAFETY DRILLS WORKS IN CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS ARE MANDATED TO REQUIRE. TO DO REGULAR FIRE DRILLS EVEN WITH THAT HEARINGS DISTRICT FIRE CODE AND THE USE OF FIRE SPRINKLERS SCHOOL FIRES CAN OCCUR. DEATH AS A RESULT THE SCHOOL FIRES HOWEVER ARE RARE. STUDENTS AND TEACHERS ARE WELL VERSED IN WHAT TO DO DURING A FIRE AND KNOW HOW TO SAFELY EVACUATE BECAUSE THEY PRACTICE. SIMILARLY WE MUST ENSURE PRACTICES OCCURRING WITH REGARD TO ACTIVE THREATS. AS WE ANALYZE A TRAGIC SCHOOL SHOOTINGS OR LAST FEW YEARS ONE FOURTH MAN IS ABLE TO IDENTIFY COMMON THREADS IN TACTICS USED BY THE SHOOTERS. AS A RESULT WE ARE ABLE TO DETERMINE THE BEST SAFETY STRATEGIES THAT SHOULD BE EMPLOYED IN ORDER TO ELIMINATE OR REDUCE FATALITIES IF A SHOOTING INCIDENT OR THREAT OCCURRED IN ONE OF OUR LOCAL CAMPUSES. THE BEST STRATEGIES HOWEVER ARE% USELESS UNLESS THE BROADER SCHOOL COMMUNITY KNOWS WHAT TO DO AND WHEN WHEN THEY ARE IN DANGER. THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY'S ONE HIDE FIGHT PROGRAM IS ONE SUCH SUCH EXAMPLE OF THE USABLE STRATEGY IS STUDENTS AND TEACHERS ARE NOT AWARE OF WHAT TO DO HOWEVER THE STRATEGIES MEANING LESS. THE LEGISLATURE BEFORE LEGISLATION BEFORE YOU TODAY IS AN EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITY FOR THE STATE THE CODIFYING RECOGNIZE BACK BEST PRACTICE INTO LAW. SUCH A REQUIREMENT WILL ENSURE THAT OUR SCHOOLS DEDICATE TIME AT LEAST ONCE PER YEAR TO PREPARE FOR A MOMENT IN TIME WHICH WE HOPE WILL NEVER OCCUR. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION TODAY THANK YOU.

TO PRINT THE TELEPHONE NUMBER OF THE NATIONAL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HOTLINE ON THE BACK OF THE STUDENT ID CARDS OUR STUDENTS ARE BEING VICTIMIZED CHRISTINE. NUMBER OF ABUSE IN TEENAGE RELATIONSHIPS. THE CDC REPORTS THAT EVERY YEAR ONE IN FOR IT ADOLESCENCE CLAIMS TO HAVE SUFFER FROM A TYPE OF ABUSE. BY A DATING PARTNER. TEENAGE SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SUFFER LASTING CONSEQUENCES FROM THE ABUSE THEY OFTEN MISS SCHOOL. DROP OUT IN OUR GREAT RISK OF BECOMING DEPRESSED SUICIDAL OR ENGAGING IN RISKY SEXUAL BEHAVIOR. WE NEED TO BE VIGILANT AND OFFER SUPPORT. HERE WITH ME IS LIZABETH ASK ABOUT WHO WILL LIKE TO OFFER HER TESTIMONY ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE THANK YOU [inaudible] HI. CHAIR MEMBERS ELIZABETH ASK ABOUT CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION SCHOOL BUSINESS OFFICIALS I JUST WANTED -- TO NOTE THAT WE ORIGINALLY HAD A SUPPORTIVE AMENDED POSITION ON THE BILL WE'RE ASKING FOR ADDITIONAL TIME TO IMPLEMENT THIS AS JUNIOR HIGH AND A FRESHMAN AND NEW STUDENT ORIENTATIONS TEND TO HAPPEN IN JULY AND AUGUST SO WE APPRECIATE AUTHORS OFFICE BEING ACCOMMODATING TO THAT CONCERN. OUT SB THREE SIXTEEN REQUIRES PRIVATE AND PUBLIC EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS TO PRINT TELEPHONE NUMBERS FOR THE DOMESTIC. VIOLENCE HOTLINE ON THE BACK OF THE SENATE ID CARDS THIS BILL IS NEEDED BECAUSE OUR ADOLESCENT AND YOUTH ARE EXPERIENCING AN INCREASING ANNA. INCREASE IN A HEALTHY AND ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIPS WE KNOW THAT THESE EXPERIENCES CAN HAVE A LASTING IMPRESSION ON STUDENTS AND FOR THESE REASONS STUDENTS NEED AND QUICK ACCESS TO THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PHONE NUMBER. AND BEING ABLE TO TURN TO THE BACK OF THE ID CARD IS THAT SOMEWHERE WHERE THEY CAN TURN FOR HELP. ANOTHER THING THAT I LIKE TO LEAVE YOU WITH IS THAT ONE OF OUR MEMBERS SPECIFICALLY SAID WE KNOW SCHOOL DISTRICTS ALREADY CURRENTLY PUTTING THESE NUMBERS ON THE BACK OF THE ID CARDS. AND ONE OF OUR MEMBERS SAID YOU KNOW WE PUT THEM ON THE ALL OF OUR STUDENTS IDEAS BECAUSE YOU JUST NEVER KNOW WHO IN THE HOME IT'S GOING TO NEED THIS PHONE NUMBER. AND SO FOR THESE REASONS I ENCOURAGE YOUR SUPPORT ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU OTHERS IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON SHARON MEMBER SHIRLEY DEATH CALIFORNIA SCHOOL VERSUS YUSHIN SUPPORT. SEEING NO OTHERS IN SUPPORT ANY OPPOSITION [inaudible] COMPORT. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME DRAPER NOW I'M THE DIRECTOR OF EDUCATION FOR THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IN CALIFORNIA. AS IF IT'S A PUBLIC POLICY VOICE OF THE CHURCH IN THE STATE WE OPPOSE SB. THREE SIXTEEN OUR OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL IS VERY SPECIFIC. THE INCLUSION OF ANY MORE NUMBERS OF OTHER HOTLINES REGARDLESS HOW WORTHY WILL DIMINISH EFFECTIVENESS OF THE ONLY NUMBER THAT'S NOW REQUIRED. I'M STOOD IDENTIFICATION CARDS THE NATIONAL SUICIDE PREVENTION LIFELINE. NOT EVERY IMPORTANT ASSISTANCE NUMBER CAN FIT ON A STUDENT ID. WITH EACH ADDITIONAL NUMBER REQUIRED AND STUDENT ID IS ALL BECOME SMALLER. AND AT SOME POINT THEY CAN BECOME USELESS. SUICIDE AMONG OUR TEENS AND COLLEGE STUDENTS IS UNPARALLELED NATIONAL CRISIS. ADDITIONAL NUMBERS BEING PLACED ON THEIR PUTS THAT AT RISK YES FROM SUICIDE AMONG CHILDREN YOUNGER THAN SEVENTEEN YEARS OF AGE. HAVE GROWN 84% IN THE LAST DECADE. AND INCREASED 210031% AMONG GIRLS AGES. TEN TO FOURTEEN SUICIDE IS NOW THE SECOND LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH FOR THOSE AGES. TEN TO TWENTY FOUR NEARLY ONE IN FIVE CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS HAVE SERIOUSLY CONSIDERED ATTEMPTING SUICIDE. MORE TIMES. EVERY LIFE IS PRECIOUS AND MUST BE PROTECTED ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY ARE WEAK AND VULNERABLE. HAVING ONLY THE NATIONAL SUICIDE PREVENTION LIFELINE ON ID'S HELPS PREVENT IMMINENT DEATH AMONG OUR YOUTH WHO ARE AT RISK OF KILLING THEMSELVES. THAT'S WHY THE SINGLE NUMBER WAS PLACED ON STUDENT ID'S WITH UNANIMOUS APPROVAL OF THE LEGISLATURE AND WITH THE UNIVERSAL SUPPORT. AMONG CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SCHOOL COMMUNITIES ALIKE. THIS ONE NUMBER GIVE STUDENTS CONTEMPLATING SUICIDE. IN OTHER STUDENTS WHO KNOW CLASSMATES THAT MAY BE DOING SO. A DEDICATED RESOURCE TO IMMEDIATELY ACCESS CRITICAL SUPPORT IN MOMENTS OF CRISIS. SB THREE SIXTEEN WOULD DETRACT FROM THIS VITAL RESOURCE. IT'S FOR THESE REASONS THAT WE RECOMMEND AND REQUEST THAT YOU VOTE NO ON SENATE BILL. THREE SIXTY THANK YOU. ANY OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. WE'LL BRING IT BACK -- TO THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS ARE JUST BECOMING AYE AYE ACTUALLY I THINK YOU TO RAISE A GOOD POINT. THAT THE LONGER LIST GROWS AND WE DO GET A LITTLE CONCERNED THAT. YOU KNOW WE'RE GOING TO RECREATE THE PHONE BOOK HERE AND THE KIDS GOING TO WALK AROUND THE PHONE BOOK. SO I JUST THINK CERTAINLY GOING FOR I'M VERY SUPPORT OF THIS TODAY BUT I THINK CERTAINLY GOING FORWARD WE NEED TO BE BE CAREFUL. ABOUT WHAT WE ADD. TO THAT LIST OTHER ALL IMPORTANT DON'T GET ME WRONG I I CAN SEE THAT OUT OF THE GATE WE JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THEY REMAIN IMPORTANT. AND THAT SOMEHOW THE FUN DOESN'T GET SMALLER SMALLER AND SMALLER IN THE CAR DOESN'T MEAN MUCH TO STUDENTS SO THAT. ANY OTHER COMMENTS MANY COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SAYING AND WE HAVE A MOTION. I JUST WANT TO ASK A QUESTION I KNOW THIS ISSUE WAS RAISED IN THE OTHER COMMITTEE HAVE YOU HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT THAT BECAUSE THAT IS A A MAJOR CONCERN THAT. I CAN THINK OF AT LEAST FOUR FIVE OF THE FOLKS ONE AT NUMBERS TO THE BACK OF THE CARD SO. HAVE YOU GIVEN THAT MUCHTHOUGHT AS TO HOW IT SHOULD BE DONE OR YOU KNOW I WAS WONDERING IF PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT LIKE THERE'S A TWO ONE ONE NUMBER THAT THEY AND FEEDS OUT. TO IN MANY CITIES TO OTHERS SUPPORT SERVICES SO YOU DON'T END UP WITH. EVERYBODY WITH THE NUMBER ON THE BACK OF THE STUDENT ID CARD. WELL I HAVE GIVEN IT MUCH TO THOUGHT AND THEN OF COURSE I'VE I RECOGNIZE ALL THE FACT THAT HE JUST OFFERED AS IT PERTAINS -- TO TEENAGE SUICIDE IT WAS AN EDUCATOR FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS AND BELIEVE ME I HAVE SEEN IT ALL. BUT I WOULD ARGUE THAT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS A SILENT KILLER I'VE SEEN. TEENAGE GIRLS GET INTO THESE RELATIONSHIPS WHERE THEY CAN GET OUT AND I WOULD SPEAK FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AS YOU ALL KNOW I'M A VICTIM OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. AND COMING FROM A VERY CATHOLIC HOUSEHOLD THESE ARE ISSUES THAT WERE NOT ALLOWED TO DISCUSS IN MY HOUSEHOLD. SO FOR ME WHEN I THINK OF MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE HAVING HAD SOMETHING. AT AND MY HANDS TO TO REACH OUT -- TO FOR SUPPORT WOULD HAVE BEEN. HELPFUL HAD I NEEDED IT AT THE TIME BUT AS IT PERTAINS TO WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT TWO NUMBERS ON A CARD -- DOESN'T SEEM LIKE MUCH I CAN I CAN SEE YOUR CONCERN ABOUT FUTURE ADDING TO THIS CARD BUT TWO NUMBERS TO ME -- IF IT HELPS SAVE A YOUNG LADY. FROM FALLING VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE I THINK IT'S IT'S DETRIMENTAL I MEAN I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE IT THERE AND I HAVE CONSIDERED I JUST THINK THAT THAT WOULD BE UP TO THE LEGISLATURE THEY CONTINUED OUT NUMBERS BUT RIGHT NOW TO NUMBERS. TO VERY CRITICAL NUMBER A SUICIDE AS I'VE SEEN THAT ALSO MY SCHOOLS AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE TEENAGE DATING VIOLENCE IS ALSO IMPORTANT SO. I AGREE WITH WHAT YOU'RE SAYING BUT THAT WOULD BE UP TO THE LEGISLATURE THEY WANT TO KEEP THAT AND I THINK THOSE TWO NUMBERS VISUALLY ARE PERFECT AND WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE. I'VE HEARD PEOPLE ASK ABOUT SEX TRAFFICKING AS WELL IN TERMS OF A NUMBER FOR THAT -- AND AND I KNOW THAT'S A MAJOR ISSUE IN CHALLENGE -- IN LOTS OF SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITIES THAT THERE AND AND JUST IS EQUALLY AS DANGEROUS IN TERMS OF THE DAMAGE YOU CAN DO TO YOUNG PEOPLE SO. YOU KNOW I I'VE I'VE HEARD FOLKS ASK AND SO I I I I'M SUPPORTIVE OF THIS BUT I AM CONCERNED. AND I THINK AS THE LEGISLATURE AT SOME POINT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FIGURE IT OUT -- WITH REGARDS TO WHAT REALLY GOES ON THE BACK OF THOSE CARS OR BETTER WAY OF DEALING WITH IT OR SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER BUT I AM CONCERNED BECAUSE I DO WANT -- TO MAKE SURE THAT WHATEVER NUMBERS WE PUT ON THERE REALLY ARE FUNCTIONAL AND SO WE DON'T HAVE SO MANY THAT. THEY BECOME MEANINGLESS IN TERMS OF EITHER THE SIZE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF FOLKS USING IT I THINK THAT'S THE CONCERN I EXPRESS. WE'VE GOT THIS. BUT ONE WAY ONE LAST YEAR NOW WE HAVE A PRETTY WE HAVE ANOTHER BILL WORKING THROUGH LEGISLATURE'S TWO RIGHT AND NEXT YEAR THEY'RE GONNA WANT TO TWITTER ON THEIR AND EVERYTHING ELSE PROBABLY RIGHT. SO -- THAT I THINK IS A REAL CONCERN YEAH BUT BUT WE WERE PREPARED JUST TO SUPPORT THIS TODAY I DON'T ANY WE NEED TO BELABOR THE POINT. BECAUSE REALLY IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU. YOUR EFFORT IT'S ABOUT NEXT YEAR THERE'S GONNA BE TEN MORE BILLS. I QUE ITEM. THAT'S MY PREDICTION AND ONE AT TEN OTHER THINGS ADDED ON THERE AND IT'S NOT THAT THEY'RE NOT IMPORTANT. ISSUES HOW DO WE MAKE THIS EFFECTIVE HOW DO WE MAKE IT WORK FOR SCHOOLS AND I CAN ISSUE A AGAIN ENSURE THAT STUDENTS TO CARRY AROUND PHONE BOOK ALL DAY. WHAT THIS BODY IS DONE SO IF I MAY -- MISTER DONALD I I UNDERSTAND BUT YOU KNOW SOMETIMES THESE CARDS ARE ALMOST USELESS YOU KNOW KIDS CARRY THEM AROUND AND AND WHICH IS VISUALLY IT'S THERE FOR THEM TO JUST. LIKE AT ALL YEAR LONG AND IF IT COULD BE JUST A RESOURCE YOU KNOW -- YOU KNOW I UNDERSTAND YOUR CONCERN BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE THOSE RESOURCES AVAILABLE BUT THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND I APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERN. GREAT ANY OTHER BECAUSE MANY OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBER SEE NO COMMENTS -- YOU MAY DO WE HAVE A MOTION.

HELLO FILE ITEM ELEVEN SB. FIVE FIVE FOR SANITY MAY PROCEED WHEN READY. HE WAS CHAIR AND MEMBERS THIS BILL INTENDS ON PROVIDING AN ADULT HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT WITH THE SAME BENEFIT AFFORDED TO MINOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WHO WISH TO AND DOING ROLE IN A COMMUNITY COLLEGE. AS YOU KNOW RESEARCH BOTH NATIONALLY AND IN CALIFORNIA'S DOCUMENTED THAT -- DOING ROMAN IS A POWERFUL STRATEGY FOR INCREASING COLLEGE SUCCESS IN AFFORDABILITY FOR LOW INCOME STUDENTS. THE BILL SIMPLY PROVIDES A STREAMLINED APPROACH FOR ADULT HIGH SCHOOL EQUIVALENCY STUDENTS TO CONCURRENTLY IN ROLE. IN COMMUNITY COLLEGE BY SIMPLIFYING THE ENROLLMENT PROCESS AND IN SOME CASES WAVING TUITION AND FEES BASICALLY SPECIAL ADMITS. TO PROVIDE GREATER CLARITY I HAVE TWO WITNESSES THAT -- WE ARE HERE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AND PROVIDE BRIEF TESTIMONY BRAND RUNS DIRECTOR OF POLICY AND ADVOCACY.

IN FALL TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN ATTEMPTING TO IMPROVE THIS CRISIS OF TRANSITION CHAFEE COLLEGE AND THE ADULT SCHOOLS IN ITS SERVICE DISTRICT EMBARKED ON A RADICAL STRATEGY. CO LOCATING CREDIT BEARING C. T. E. AND COLLEGE TRANSITION CLASSES AT THE ADULT SCHOOLS. AFTER ONE SEMESTER THE ADULT SCHOOL STAFF EXPRESS THAT MANY HIGH SCHOOL EQUIVALENCY AND HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA STUDENTS WERE NOT ENROLLING IN THE CLASSES. BECAUSE THEY WERE INTIMIDATED BY THE PERSONAL IDENTIFYING INFORMATION REQUIRED TO ENROLL SUCH AS INCOME VERIFICATION. AND CALIFORNIA RESIDENCY DOCUMENTATION. IN CALIFORNIA THE SPECIAL PART TIME ADMIN ROMAN STATUS IS A TOOL THAT COLLEGES USED TO ENROLL HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WITHOUT REQUIRING THEM TO COMPLETE FINANCIAL AID APPLICATIONS INCOME VERIFICATION AND RESIDENCY INFORMATION. IN SPRING TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN CHAFEE COLLEGE CREATED A STRUCTURE DUAL ENROLLMENT PROGRAM FOR ADULT HSE AND HSE STUDENTS. USING THE SPECIAL PART TIME ADMIT ENROLLMENT PROCESS TO OVERCOME THE BARRIERS OF THE PREVIOUS SEMESTERS CHALLENGES. THE PROGRAM SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED ENROLLMENT FROM THESE POPULATIONS IT WAS ADORED BY THE ADULT SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS AND RECEIVE TREMENDOUS INTEREST FROM OTHER COLLEGE AS AN ADULT SCHOOLS. AFTER THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE NOTIFIED CHIEF THE COLLEGE THAT ADULT SCHOOL STUDENTS WERE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR SPECIAL PART TIME ENROLLMENT. THE COLLEGE HALTED ITS CREDIT BEARING DUAL ENROLLMENT PROGRAM.
