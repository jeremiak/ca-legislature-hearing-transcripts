AB TWO SIXTY TWO MAKES CLEAR THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC AGAINST FUTURE COMMUNICABLE DISEASE OUTBREAKS. SPECIFICALLY THIS BILL DOES TWO THINGS ONE IT CLARIFIES A LOCAL HEALTH OFFICERS AUTHORITY TO ISSUE ORDERS TO LOCAL JURISDICTIONS IN RESPONSE TO A COMMUNICABLE DISEASE DISEASE OUTBREAK. AND SECONDLY IT REQUIRES A LOCAL HEALTH OFFICER TO MAKE RELEVANT INFORMATION SPECIFICALLY THE LOCATIONS IN CONCENTRATIONS OF CASES RELATED TO COMMUNICABLE DISEASE OUTBREAKS AVAILABLE TO THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WITHIN THE COUNTY.

OKAY OPPOSITION SO WITH THREE MINUTES EACH THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIMEMY NAME IS NICHOLAS JOHNSON AND I'M HERE ARMED SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF PARENTS UNITED FOR KIDS. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSES THAT. WE'RE HERE TODAY BECAUSE AGENCIES FAILED TO DO THEIR JOB. AND NOW WE'RE ASKING TO GIVE THEM UNLIMITED POWER. DURING THE PRESS CONFERENCE. THERE WAS INTRODUCED WHILE THIS BILL WAS COMING OUT. SUPERVISOR FLETCHER MENTIONED THAT DURING THE H. ONE N. ONE SITUATION. THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO MASS VACCINATE SCHOOL CHILDREN [inaudible] NOW. THERE'S A LOT OF PROBLEMS HERE BUT IN THAT SAME PRESS CONFERENCE. ARE REPRESENTATIVE GLORIA. ALSO MENTION HE WANTED TO HEAR THE VOICES OF THE PEOPLE. I HOPE YOU IN YOUR MIND TODAY. THOUSANDS OF PARENTS HAVE BEEN TO THIS CAPITAL. TO SPEAK WHEN SB TWO SEVEN SEVEN CAME UP AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE ADDRESSED WAS THE CDC WHISTLEBLOWER WILLIAM THOMPSON. WHO CAME OUT AND SAID THAT IN THE CDC THEY HAVE BEEN COMMITTING FRAUD IN TERMS OF OUR VACCINATION PROGRAM? OUR CONCERN OF THOR TARIAN THIS. AND I HOPE THAT THIS MEASURE IS RELEASED TAILORED TO MEET THAT SPECIFIC NEEDS DURING THE AUDIT FOR EXAMPLE. ARE IT WAS MENTIONED THAT. SOME OF THE SUGGESTIONS WERE THAT YOU CAN USE HAND WASHING STATIONS ACCESS TO RUSH ROOMS. THAT STREET CLEANING THESE WERE MEASURES THAT WE ABSOLUTELY SUPPORT. WE HAVE HOMELESS CAMPS ACROSS THIS COUNTRY AND THE SITUATIONS ARE ABSOLUTELY A DIRE TRUTH THAT THIS IS A SITUATION THAT COULD CAUSE A PLAGUE. WE HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF WHY DO WE HAVE SUCH A HOMELESS EPIDEMIC IN THISCOUNTRY. AND I WOULD VENTURE TO SAY THAT ONE OF THE BIG THINGS IS WE ARE OVERLY TAXED. WE HAVE THE HIGHEST COST OF LIVING INSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES AND WE HAVE TO REALLY ADDRESS THIS I'M WITH YOU IN FULL SUPPORT THAT WE NEED TO TREAT THESE PEOPLE NOT AS RATS IN THE STREETS THESE ARE HUMAN BEINGS. SO WHAT I'M ASKING IS SIMPLY THAT WHEN WE LOOK AT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO MOVING FORWARD THAT. SENATOR PHIL I'M SORRY REPRESENTATIVE FLETCHER AT MY TO COMMENT ALSO THAT THIS WAS -- HUMANITY ISSUE AND I AGREE WITH THAT STATEMENT FOR FOR A FULL FULL HEARTEDLY THIS IS A HUMANITY ISSUE. THAT REQUIRES A HUMANE APPROACH DOES NOT REQUIRE AUTHORITARIANISM NOW I WOULD ALSO JUST US THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH THESE LEGISLATIVE BILLS THAT AFFECTS SO MANY CALIFORNIANS. YOU MENTIONED CENTER ARE REPRESENTED GLORIA THAT. YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO HEAR THE VOICE OF THE PEOPLE I WOULD ASK THAT WE ALSO INTRODUCE LEGISLATION THAT GIVES US MORE THAN THREE MINUTES TO SPEAK ON SUCH MATTERS THAT AFFECTS SO MANY CALIFORNIANS EVERY SINGLE DAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. BEFORE WE GO AHEAD IT IS THE CUSTOM OF THIS HOUSE THAT WE DO NOT ALLOW REPLIES OR DEMONSTRATIONS OF OF ANYTHING. UNLESS YOU WANT TO WEIGH YOUR FINGERS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT PLEASE NO APPLAUSE NO JEERING NO CAT CALLS NOTHING PLEASE THAT'S THE CUSTOM OF OUR HOUSE AND WE ASK THAT YOU RESPECT THAT WHEN YOU'RE IN OUR HOUSE. WILL OUT HERE A SECOND WITNESS THANK YOU. I THANK YOU AMEND ASSEMBLY MEMBER WITHIN THE OTHER MEMBERS OF ADDRESS ADVOCACY I'M I THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER DORIES OFFICE FOR BEING OPEN TO HAVING CONVERSATIONS ABOUT AMENDMENTS THAT WE'VE REQUESTED I DID SEND ALL OF THOSE TO EACH OF YOUR OFFICES AS WELL. MY WE AGREE WITH THE INTENTION OF THIS BILL WHICH IS TO A LOT PUBLIC OF COMMUNICABLE DISEASE AND ENSURE THAT IT'S DRESSED QUICKLY AND EFFECTIVELY IS CURRENTLY WORDED -- THIS BILL IS OVERLY BROAD AND COULD RESULT IN THE ABUSE OF POWER. I GIVES YOU NATURAL BLANKET AUTHORITY TO THE HEALTH OFFICER TISSUE QUOTE UNQUOTE DIRECTIVES TO OTHER GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES WITHIN THAT JURISDICTION TO TAKE ANY ACTION. THE HEALTH OFFICER DEEMS NECESSARY IT'S THAT WOULD ANY THAT WE HAVE A ISSUE. WITH -- IT ALSO IN THE AMENDMENTS MAKE IT EVEN MORE BROAD THAT SAY THAT DURING AN OUTBREAK OF COMMUNICABLE DISEASE OR UPON IMMINENT AND PROXIMATE THREAT OF A COMMUNICABLE DISEASE -- THE THE BACK ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN. ON AN OUTBREAK IN CALIFORNIA AND ACCORDING TO THE CDC IS THREE PEOPLE AN EPIDEMIC IS SEVEN PEOPLE SO LET'S JUST BE CLEAR WHEN WE SAY OUTBREAK IT'S NOT HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WERE TALKING ABOUT FOR THREE PEOPLE -- YOUR AS LEGISLATORS TOSSED WITH MAKING LAWS THAT A NARROWLY TAILORED AND SPECIFIC THIS BILL IS NOT. BOTH FROM THE ACTION OF THE LOCAL HEALTH OFFICE CAN DIMOND AND ALSO FROM A FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY SO THIS ALLOWS A HEALTH OFFICER TO TAKE ANY ACTION REGARDLESS OF COST -- YOU BROUGHT THIS BILL FORWARD IN RESPONSE TO THE HEPATITIS A OUTBREAK IN SAN DIEGO HOWEVER THE AUDIT REPORT MAKES IT CLEAR THAT THIS ISSUE IS NOT WHAT ACTION WAS ACTUALLY HAPPENED BUT HOW QUICKLY AND EFFECTIVELY THAT ACTION WAS TAKEN. THIS BILL DOESN'T FULLY ADDRESS THAT AND INSTEAD GIVES THE LOCAL HEALTH OFFICER JUST MORE POLICE POWERS. WHILE WE MAY BELIEVE THAT TODAY'S HEALTH OFFICES WOULD DO THE RIGHT THING WE'VE ALL LIVED IN A TIME WHERE WE DON'T AGREE WITH THE FED OFFICIALS IN POWER. CALIFORNIA HAS A LONG HIS BRECHER OF MEDICAL ABUSE ON ITS PEOPLE SO WHAT COULD THIS BILL LEAD TO THE SEPARATION OF CHILDREN AND PARENTS IF THEY REFUSE MEDICAL TREATMENT QUARANTINE OF EVERY MEMBER IN A SUDDEN ZIP CODE. WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF IF AN OFFICIAL WHO DECIDED THAT THE NAME OF COMMON GOOD IN PROTECTING OTHERS THAT THEY COULD MARRY METAPHORICALLY INVADE OUR BEDROOMS AND MANDATE THAT EVERYONE HAD PROTECTED SEX SO IT'S NICE TO DE EPIDEMIC DOESN'T SPREAD? THE LEGISLATURE IS TOSSED IT DRAWING LINES THIS BILL DOES NOT DRAW A LINE TO GIVE A SPECIFIC EXAMPLE IN THE UNITED KINGDOM WHERE I GREW UP THERE WAS A SWINE FLU OUTBREAK IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS THAT WE HAVEN'T SO THE SOLUTION WAS TO SIMPLY. VACCINATE SIX MILLION PEOPLE RAM UNPRECEDENTED FOR IT SCOTT SCALE AND ITS SIZE IT TURNS OUT BUT ONE IN EVERY FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO WERE GIVEN THAT VACCINE. IT CAUSED AN IMMUNE SYSTEM TO ATTACK THE WHOLE CLASSED AS A VENUE RUNS IN THEIR BRAIN. PEOPLE GENETICALLY PREDISPOSED THE VACCINE ACTUALLY TRIGGERS THEIR OWN BODIES TO GIVE THEIR BRAINS A PARTIAL LOBOTOMY. NOW THE BEST SCIENTIST IN THE U. K. STUDIED THIS FOR SIX YEARS AND IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT AGAIN OFFICIALLY ACKNOWLEDGE PUBLICLY. BUT IT WAS TRUE AND THAT THEY EXPECT TO BE PAYING HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE OVER ONE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. THAT SUMS NOT SUFFICIENT TO COMPENSATE WHAT HAPPENS TO THOSE PEOPLE THAT HAD THAT EFFECT. THIS BILL MAY BE MORE RESTRICTIVE STE THIS BILL HAS TO BE MORE RESTRICTIVE SO THAT LESS INTRUSIVE BUT EFFECTIVE AND QUICKLY ACTIONABLE POLICIES A TAKEN. BEFORE THE MOST RESTRICTIVE INVASIVE -- OUT ONES ARE -- AND THAT IT DOESN'T INFRINGE ON A PERSON'S FUNDAMENTAL CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS WHEN DEALING WITH SOMEONE AS SOMETHING AS PRECIOUS OCCUR AS FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT IT REQUIRES THE LEGISLATURE TO BE MINDFUL. OF AN EQUAL ANCIENT CONCEPT OF HUBRIS THANK YOU. I HAVE ONE MORE PART OF WE ALSO BELIEVE WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE AN AMENDMENT THAT. ENSURE IS THAT AFTER A PUBLIC HEALTH WHICH TO THE ORDER THAT WAS DONE SAID THAT. THE PLAN FOR RESPONSE -- SHOULD BE AMENDED IN THE FUTURE I'M I WOULD CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE WITH HIS OFFICE I'M STAND THIS BILL WILL BE VOTED OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE BUT WE ALSO THAT YOU'RE REQUIRE THE WHAT ANY BE STEPS. TO TEN SUBSTITUTED FOR SOMETHING MORE NARROWLY TAILORED PRIOR TO PASSING IT OUT OF THE COMMITTEE AND THAT THE HEALTH OFFICER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR POST OUTBREAK ANALYSIS.

WOULD YOU PRICE FROM SAN JOSE I OPPOSE THIS BILL. TO ANYONE ELSE. CASEY KNOWN BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. YEAH I MISSED THE FIRST PART OF OF THE TESTIMONY. AND JUST HEARING THE PUBLIC COMMENT -- AND I'M A LITTLE BIT. CONFUSED ABOUT BECAUSE AS I'M READING THE BILL TAX THE LANGUAGE HERE -- I'M NOT SURE THAT I THAT I UNDERSTAND THIS IS AN ANTI VAX TYPE OF A OF A BILL AND SOME I'M WONDERING. IF YOU CAN PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT OF OF OF CLARIFICATION AND WHAT'S THE AND IN THE IN THE REAL INTENT OF OF THE BILL I JUST READING THIS SOME I DON'T KNOW. THE COMMENTS THAT I HEARD I DON'T SEE THAT ANY ANYWHERE HERE -- BUT WHERE YOU ARE A COUPLE WEEKS AGO OR I WAS WHERE YOU ARE NOW A COUPLE WEEKS AGO -- THE ORIGIN OF THIS BILLS THE STATE AUDIT IN RESPONSE THE APPETITE IS A CRISIS IT WAS IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY THIS BUDGET TO BE AT A COUNTIES. AND KILLED OVER. OVER TWENTY PEOPLE IN OUR STATE -- ATION HAVE TO DO -- WITH THE FIRST PORTION OF THIS TWO PART BILL WHICH IS PROVIDING LOCAL HEALTH OFFICERS AND AUTHORITY TO ISSUE ORDERS TO LOCAL JURISDICTIONS RESPONSE TO A COMMUNICABLE DISEASE OUTBREAK. HOW THAT WORKED IN SAN DIEGO WAS THAT THERE WAS A DISCONNECT BETWEEN THE COUNTY HEALTH OFFICER WHO WANT CERTAIN STEPS TAKEN TO CONTAIN THE SPREAD OF THE? DISEASE -- THAT WAS GENERALLY POWER WASHING OF SIDEWALKS HAND WASHING STATIONS. SANITARY CONDITIONS AS WELL AS VACCINATIONS AND THAT DELAY -- THAT IT ABILITY TO PROVIDE THAT DIRECTION RESULTED IN -- THE NOTICING OF THE HEPATITIS OUTBREAK STARTED IN FEBRUARY OR MARCH OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN BUT NO DECLARATION OR FROM HAVE ACTIONS BEING TAKEN TO AUGUST OR SEPTEMBER. OF THAT SAME YEAR IN THAT LINK THE TIME HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE BECAME SICK AND MANY DIED AND SO -- THE THE BECAUSE OF THAT VAGUENESS THAT THE AUDITOR DISCOVERED IN TERMS OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS SAN DIEGO FEELING AS THOUGH SHE DID NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO SAY TO THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO THIS ACCOUNT EMPLOY. TALKING TO THE CITY TO SAY YOU MAY DO THIS ARE YOU MUST DO THIS -- RESULTED IN A SLOW RESPONSE THAT WE THINK SEAN FACTIONS SO -- WITH REGARD TO THE SPECIFIC ISSUE OF VACCINATIONS BECAUSE THIS OF COURSE IS ALWAYS A HIGHLY CHARGED ISSUE. I WANT TO JUST BE VERY CLEAR THERE'S NOTHING IN EIGHTY TWO SIXTY TWO THE PROVIDES FOR THE AUTHORITY FOR COMPULSORY VACCINATION. IN FACT RIGHT NOW THERE'S NO EXPRESS AT THE FORTY FOUR COMPULSORY VACCINATIONS ABSENT A COURT ORDER OR DECLARATION OF EMERGENCY. CALIFORNIA HAS EVEN GONE SO FAR MR MAYES AS NOT ADOPTING THE MODEL STATE HEALTH EMERGENCY POWERS ACT THE WAY THAT MANY OTHER STATES HAVE DONE WHICH AUTHORIZES COMPULSORY VACCINATION DURING STATES A PUBLIC EMERGENCY WHICH IS NOW SETTLED LAW. CALIFORNIA HAS SAID THAT THE CONSTITUTION IS CLEAR TO PROJECTS PROTECTION AFFORD CIVIL LIBERTIES TO ALL OF ITS RESIDENTS THIS BILL NO WAY CHANGES THAT TO JUST TO BE CLEAR THIS BILL IS NOT GOING TO ALLOW THE GOVERNMENT TO FORCE VACCINATIONS NO SIR. THANK YOU. EXCUSE ME A NOTE PLEASE PLEASE. THANK YOU. OTHER QUESTIONS FOR ME. MEMBERS NOT ACTUALLY A NOT UNLESS THE MEMBER ASKS DIRECTLY SO. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER TESTIMONY AND QUESTIONS FROM. LAST. ASK FOR EXTRA SKEWS ME -- THE TESTIMONIES OVER THIS A QUESTIONS BETWEEN THE MEMBERS. AND THEN WE WILL AND WE WILL TAKE A VOTE SO THANK YOU THAT'S A WHERE PROCESS WORKS HERE. MR FLOOR. THAT SINCE I DID COME IN LATE I WOULD ACTUALLY WOULD APPRECIATE YOUR RESPONSE TO THAT IF YOU EVERYTHING THAT PLEASE. THANK YOU IT WAS PART OF MIND OR INTENT PART OF MY TESTIMONY SO OUR CONCERN IS THE WORD ANY -- THE ACTION IT'S IT STATES THE LOCAL HEALTH AUTHORITY CAN OR THE OFFICER CAN TAKE ANY ACTION -- WHILE CALIFORNIA IT IS CORRECT DOESN'T -- VACCINATIONS COULD BE MANDATED SO DURING AN OUTBREAK OR FORCED SO TO SPEAK -- AND SO OUR CONCERN IS OUR OUR REQUEST IS TO HAVE THE THE WEDDING CHANGED SO IT'S MORE NARROWLY TAILORED SAID FOR EXAMPLE THAT IT IS. THE MOST EFFECTIVE AND LEAST INVASIVE ACTION -- AND SO WHILE VACCINATION ISN'T. YOU KNOW FOR THINGS LIKE HEPATITIS A THE MEASLES OUTBREAK ACROSS THE COUNTRY RIGHT NOW IS FORCING YOU KNOW MEASLES VACCINATIONS OR OR PUTTING THAT. OUT THERE -- AND SO I THINK THAT'S THE CONCERN OF MANY OF THESE -- CONSTITUENTS THAT HAVE COME TODAY -- IS THAT IT IT IS A POSSIBILITY THIS BILL DOESN'T SPECIFICALLY SAY THAT VACCINATIONS WOULD HAPPEN BUT FOR ANYTHING THAT IS. BACK SCENE HAS A VACCINE FOR IT IS LIKELY THAT THAT VACCINE WOULD BE PUSHED. AND THAT'S THE CONCERN. SO WOULD YOU LIKE TO RESPOND TO THAT. SHORT I.. I THINK I THINK THAT THIS IS A POINT OF OF OF AGREEMENT. BETWEEN THE PARTS OF THIS BILL MYSELF -- THAT THIS BILL DOES NOT PRESCRIBE COMPULSORY BACK. IN THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION -- THAT THE BILL SPEAKS -- TO IN TERMS OF THE AUTHORITY THAT'S GIVEN I MEAN WE'RE WITH THERE ARE ADDITIONAL AMENDMENTS AND WE'RE HAVING ONGOING CONVERSATIONS WITH PUBLIC HEALTH PROFESSIONALS TO MAKE SURE THAT. THE IN SOME CASES THIS IS TAYLOR -- OUTBREAKS LIKE LIGHTS WOULD NOT REQUIRE THIS KIND OF INTERVENTION RIGHT -- BUT IN TERMS OF THE THE THE MOST SUITED INTERVENTIONS -- YOU KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NOT CONTINUE TO TO VACCINATIONS BUT VERY MUCH WHAT THE OPPONENTS ARE TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW FOR PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER TO TELL THE CITY AS THEY DID TO MINE -- THAT YOU NEED TO START PUTTING -- PORTA POTTIES -- IN IN HIGHLY CONCENTRATED HOMELESS IS THERE XIN THAT WE WERE SEEN AND ACTUALLY SPREAD THIS DISEASE THAT'S WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TENS OF ANY TERMS OF PROVIDING THAT ADDITIONAL AUTHORITY AND TAILORING AND I THINK RISKS THE ABILITY OF BEING SO PRESCRIPTIVE THE POINT THE BILL DOES IT MAKE. DOES NOT ALLOW THE KINDS INTERVENTIONS WERE TALKING OUT WE'RE TALKING A HEPATITIS IN THIS CASE IT COULD BE ANOTHER COMMUNICABLE DISEASE -- AND SO THIS PROVIDES THE PROFESSIONALS WHO ARE INVOLVED -- THE LATITUDE THAT THEY NEED TO BE EFFECTIVE -- A SPEAKING WITH THE PROFESSIONALS WHO DO THIS WORK NONE OF THEM ARE INTERESTED IN REACHING THE CONSTITUTION OR IN DOING. OTHER KINDS OF THINGS THAT ARE BEYOND THEIR SCOPE IF ANYTHING THAT EXPRESSED TO MEDIA STREAM RETICENCE ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON BUT ALL OF THEM AGREE THAT NO WHERE IN THIS BILL DOES IT CONTAIN COMPULSORY VACCINATION REQUIREMENTS. MOVE THE BILL. BUSH'S SECOND ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. THE MOTION SECOND MISTER GLORY WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE JUST FOR THE RECORD MISTER CHAIRMAN AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME OF YOUR COMMITTEE AND FOR YOUR MEMBERS I LIKE TO GIVE THANKS TO THE HELP OFFICERS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA.

ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS THAT WE SEE IS SOME TRANSLATED MATERIAL SO WE'VE CERTAIN TERMS IN ENGLISH USUALLY PROPER NOUNS OFTEN ACRONYMS -- SO YOU CAN IMAGINE SOMEBODY WILL BE READING SOMETHING AND IT WILL SAY A WHOLE BUNCH OF WORDS IN THEIR LANGUAGE AND THEN ALL THE SENATE SWITCHES TO ENGLISH AND THEN IT GOES BACK TO THEIR LANGUAGE -- WHEN I WAS AT A GROUP? REPRESENTING CLIENTS DIRECTLY I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS -- MANY OF OUR LOCAL LEGAL SERVICES ACTUALLY HELP PEOPLE OVER THE PHONE SO THEN IT'S A BIGGER PROBLEM BECAUSE THE CLIENT IS SAYING I HAVE THIS NOTICE I DON'T WANT TO KNOW WHAT IT MEANS AND I CAN'T READ IT TO YOU BECAUSE IT'S IN. YOU KNOW PARTIALLY THEIR LANGUAGE AND PARTIALLY ENGLISH -- MOST OF THIS COMES FROM JUST CONVICTIONS OF DECIDING THAT PROPER NOUNS DON'T NEED TO BE TRANSLATED OR THE ACRONYM SHOULD BE USED -- LOOKING IN THIS FURTHER WE REALIZED THAT THE PROBLEM IS OFTEN THE BASE ENGLISH DOCUMENT THAT THE ENGLISH DOCUMENTS ARE UNDERSTANDABLE BY OUR CLIENTS EITHER -- SO AB THREE ONE EIGHT WOULD DEAL WITH BOTH FIELD TESTING TRANSLATIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE CAN ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND THEM AS WELL AS MAKE HE MEDI CAL DOCUMENTS MORE UNDERSTANDABLE TO BEGIN WITH. SOME OF THE OTHER PROBLEMS THAT WE'VE BEEN SEEN WITH TRANSLATIONS THAT WOULD BE HELP I FEEL TESTING IS SOME TRANSLATED MATERIALS ARE WRITTEN IN THE DIALECT OF THE LANGUAGE THAT'S NOT SPOKEN BY THE LOCAL COMMUNITY MEMBERS -- SOME CONSUMERS ARE REPORTING RECEIVING MATERIALS THAT ARE TOO FORMAL THEY STILL HAVE TECHNICAL TERMS IN THEM THAT CONSUMERS DON'T UNDERSTAND -- JUST AS READERS OF ENGLISH DON'T UNDERSTAND MATERIALS WRITTEN IN LEGALESE ARE LOTS OF TECHNICAL HEALTH INDUSTRY. LANGUAGE NEITHER DO READERS OF OTHER LANGUAGES TOO OFTEN MEDI CAL DOCUMENTS SEEK TO TEACH THE CONSUMERS ABOUT NEW TERMS THAT THEY SHOULD KNOW RATHER THAN USING PLAIN ENGLISH THAT THEY ALREADY KNOW. FOR EXAMPLE IF A CONSUMER WANTS TO KNOW ABOUT GETTING A RIDE TO THE DOCTOR THEY NEED TO LEARN ABOUT AND M. T. AND ANY M. T. WHY CAN'T WE JUST TALK ABOUT A RIDE TO THE DOCTOR OR RIGHT TO THE DOCTOR IF YOU NEED SPECIAL ACCOMMODATIONS. AND IN SOME TRANSLATIONS ARE TOO LITERAL BUT NOT UNDERSTANDABLE FOR EXAMPLE ONE TO HEALTH PLANS LANGUAGE ACCESS SHE GIVES A PHONE NUMBER TO CALL IN EACH LANGUAGE AND IT TELLS THE ENROLLEE SAID THEY SPEAK TRADITIONAL CHINESE. THEY CAN GET LANGUAGE ASSISTANCE I WILL TRANSFER LANGUAGE AS THESE. SOME OF THESE TRANSLATION PROMPT -- PROBLEMS STEM FROM THE FACT THAT THE ORIGINAL DOCUMENT AS I MENTIONED BEFORE IT'S TOO HARD TO UNDERSTAND EVEN IN ENGLISH SO WHEN WE WENT BACK AND LOOKED AT THIS BILL WE THOUGHT A GREAT THING TO DO WOULD BE TO GET THE KEY MEDI CAL DOCUMENTS. TAKE THEM TO AN OUTSIDE READABILITY EXPERT AND ACTUALLY HAVE THEM PUT INTO PLAIN ENGLISH WHERE WE'RE NOT USING JARGON AND THINGS THAT PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND. AND WITH THAT I'D JUST RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE AND I'M GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE. MARKETS CUSTER. WELL MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS MARKETS GOT THROWN THE CALIFORNIA PAN ETHNIC HEALTH NETWORK -- ALSO A PRODUCT -- SPONSOR OF AB -- THREE ONE EIGHT A C. PEN IS A STATE WIDE MULTICULTURAL HEALTH ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION THAT SEEKS TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE AND ELIMINATE HEALTH DISPARITIES -- BY ADVOCATING FOR PUBLIC POLICIES AND RESOURCES -- TO ADDRESS HEALTH NEEDS OF COMMUNITIES OF COLOR -- ONE AREA FOCUS RECEIVE TEN HAS BEEN LANGUAGE ACCESS AND RECENTLY OUR COMMUNITY -- PARTNERS HAVE BEEN VOICING FRESH ALL DOCUMENTS AS IT IS. WE RECENTLY SPOKE WITH A HEALTHCARE PROVIDER -- AND DAY DETAILED THEIR EXPERIENCE WITH THE MEDICAL PROGRESS PROGRAM. THEY WERE OF REPRESENTATIVE OF A HEALTH CLINIC IN OAKLAND AND THEY HAVE A CONSUMER BASE OF WHERE 90% OF THEIR PATIENTS. ARE LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENT. THEY EXPLAIN THAT THEIR ELIGIBILITY STUFF. DO THEIR BEST TO WALK NEW PATIENTS THROUGH. THE PROCESS OF ENROLLMENT IN THE SCOPE OF BENEFITS THAT THEY ARE ENTITLED. TO BUT SMALLER CLINICS DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY TO SPEND THAT AMOUNT OF TIME IT TAKES TO FULLY EXPLAIN -- THE NUANCES OF MEDI CAL -- SO THE OTHER OPTION THESE CLINICS HAVE IS TO PROVIDE INFORMATION MATERIAL TO THE BENEFICIARIES. HOWEVER BECAUSE THOSE TRANSLATE DOCUMENTS -- THAT ARE AVAILABLE ARE NOT THAT ADEQUATE THOSE TO UNDERSTAND COMPLETELY THE SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE TO THEM -- THE REPRESENT ALSO NOTED THAT WHILE LANGUAGE ACCESS IT YOU'RE VERY FOR MANY OF THEIR PATIENTS -- IT. PEOPLE THAT SPEAK ENGLISH AS A PRIMARY LANGUAGE ALSO HAVE TROUBLE UNDERSTANDING THE DOCUMENTS THEMSELVES AS THE LANGUAGE THAT'S USED IN ON AREN'T REALLY FRIENDLY TO PEOPLE WHO ARE HEALTH LITERATE -- I NOTICED BECAUSE IT THIS -- RECENT REPORT FROM THE STATE AUDITOR NOTED THAT -- MILLIONSOF CHILDREN MEDI CAL OR NOT RECEIVING PREVENTATIVE HEALTH SERVICES AND ONE OF THE KEY RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THAT CAME -- THAT CAME OUT THAT REPORT WAS A D. SHE HAS SHOULD ENSURE THAT PLANS ARE EFFECTIVELY MITIGATING. CHILD -- HEALTH DISPARITIES RELATED TO CULTURAL AND LINGUISTIC NEEDS AND THAT THE ISSUE HAS TO PROVIDE INFORMATION. TO PLANTS PROVIDERS AND BENEFICIARIES ABOUT THE SERVICES THE DEPARTMENT EXPECTS CHILDREN TO RECEIVE. THE REPORT NOTED THAT THE DEPARTMENTS -- CURRENT -- INFORMATION MATERIALS -- THAT THEY SENT TO BENEFICIARIES ARE -- WE LOOK TO SOLVE THOSE READABILITY ISSUES THROUGH THIS BILL AND FOR THAT REASON WE'RE PRACTICAL SPONSOR AND WE THINK THE AUTHOR FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THE ISSUE AND REQUEST AN IDOL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHERS IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRS AT RECORD OVER THE CALIFORNIA DOWN ASSOCIATION WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF THIS ESPECIALLY APPRECIATE THE ANALYSIS NOTING.

THESE REQUIREMENTS ARE CONTAINED IN ALL PLAN LETTER AND IN CONTRACTS BETWEEN THE HEALTH PLANS IN THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES.

OVERALL THIS BILL ADDS ADDITIONAL COSTS AND REQUIRE ADDITIONAL STATE IN MANAGED CARE PLAN RESOURCES AND OFFERS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMMUNITY REVIEWED MATERIALS WOULD BE MORE.

A LOT OF THE DOCUMENTS WE WOULD HAVE TO PUT OUT TO FIELD TEST OR DOCUMENTS WE GET FROM DH CS SO WE WOULD HAVE A DIFFICULT WE COULDN'T CHANGE THOSE. SO I THINK IN ADDITION TO ASSOCIATE MYSELF WITH GET CAP WE DO HAVE A LOT OF CONCERNS ABOUT THE TIME IT WOULD TAKE AND THE EXTENSIVE NATURE IT WOULD TAKE TO PRESS TO CHANGE THESE DOCUMENTS BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT. WANT TO JUST REITERATE MANY OF THESE WE CANNOT CHANGE BECAUSE THEY ARE DH CS DOCUMENTS WE CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND SECTION THREE OF THE BILL AND HAVING THE DEPARTMENT LOOK AT A NUMBER OF THEIR OF THEIR MATERIALS AND TRYING TO GET THOSE.

SO WE'LL LEAVE IT OPEN FOR OTHERS TO ADD ON THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS SEGMENT YOU HAVE TO BILLS BEFORE US. AB. THREE SIXTY TWO I RECOGNIZE YOUR WITNESS [inaudible] YOU HAVE. SO GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- I AM BACK HERE ON A ON AN ISSUE THAT WILL BE FAMILIAR TO MOST OF YOU -- AND I THANK YOU. AND I FROM THE LAST BILL I JUST WENT THROUGH WE HAVE A CLEAR INDICATION THAT WE DON'T. THERE'S NOT ONE A PANACEA THERE IS NOT ONE FIX OFFER ADDICTION -- AND WE NEED TO HAVE A FULL RANGE OF OPTIONS TO KEEP PEOPLE LIVE LONG ENOUGH. TO GET THEM CLEAN AND TO GET BACK ON TRACK IN THEIR LIVES -- THIS BILL. WILL ALLOW THIS YEAR TO SCALE DOWN FROM SOMETHING THAT YOU VOTED ON BEFORE. THIS BILL WILL JUST ALLOW SAN FRANCISCO TO OVERDOSE. PREVENTION PROGRAM PILOT SO OVERDOSE PREVENTION PROGRAM AGAIN THIS IS THE GOAL OF THIS BILL IS TO STOP PEOPLE FROM OVER DOSING. TO GIVE THEM ACCESS TO TREATMENT. SO THAT THEY CAN GET THEIR LIVES BACK TOGETHER -- PROGRAMS UNDER THIS BY IT'S TO CONSUME CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE IN A CLINICAL SETTING WHERE THEY WERE WERE THEY ARE MEDICALLY SUPERVISED. WE KNOW FROM OVER A HUNDRED PROGRAMS AROUND THE WORLD THAT THIS IS AFFECTED IN REDUCING OVERDOSES. IN REDUCING RATES OF HIV. IN REDUCING H. RATES OF HEPATITIS C. IN REDUCING RATES OF NEEDLES BEING AND PARKS AND PLAYGROUNDS AND SCHOOL YARDS. I'M SURE EVERYONE OF YOU IN YOUR DISTRICTS HAVE HAD AREAS WHERE THE POLICE HAVE TO GO IN AND DO SWEEPS TO CLEAR OUT WE'RE HOMES ARE CONGREGATING AND WHERE. PEOPLE ARE PUBLICLY USING AND ONE OF THEBIGGEST AFTER EFFECTS IS THE AMOUNT OF NEEDLES THAT ARE FOUND IN PARKS AND PUBLIC SPACES AFTERWARDS WHERE CHILDREN HAVE ACCESS TO THEM. AND WHERE DISEASE CONTINUES TO SPREAD. THIS BILL HAS A SIX YEAR SUNSET WHICH REQUIRES ANNUAL REPORTING TO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT ABOUT THE IMPACTS. ON THE NUMBER OF THE PEOPLE IN THE PROGRAM WHO'S USING THE PROGRAM AND HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE GETTING REFERRED TO TREATMENT SO WE CAN ACTUALLY. DEMONSTRATE THAT THIS IS AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO GET PEOPLE INTO TREATMENT -- AS YOU KNOW THE PEOPLE WHO ARE BASICALLY LIVING IN USING ON THE STEEP STREETS HAVE A LOT OF MEDICAL ISSUES THAT GO ALONG WITH THAT OFTEN TIMES -- ISSUES AROUND INFECTIONS ISSUES AROUND AGAIN TRANSMITTABLE DISEASES -- SWELLING OFTENTIMES PEOPLE GET ABSCESSES -- WHICH WHICH CAN RESULT IN LOSS OF WE KNOW OUR NINE ONE ONE OF FOLKS ARE OVERWHELMED WITH RESPONDING TO PEOPLE OVERDOSING WE KNOW OUR EMERGENCY ROOMS ARE OVERWHELMED WITH PEOPLE COMING IN. WITH THESE KINDS OF ISSUES SO THIS IS A COMMON SENSE OF RESEARCH INFORMED INTERVENTION THAT WE HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO TRY HERE IN IN -- THIS DID UNITED STATES BUT WE HOPE THIS WILL BE THE FIRST ONE A PILOT AGAIN WE DON'T WE DON'T SAY IT'S THE ANSWER TO EVERYTHING BUT WE SAY IT'S THE ANSWER TO FOR SOME -- AS YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN ON THIS JOURNEY FOR A COUPLE YEARS NOW FIRMLY BELIEVING IN HARM REDUCTION FIRMLY BELIEVING IN THAT EVERY LIFE MATTERS AND THAT IS MUCH AS WE CAN EXPAND ACCESS TO TO DIGNITY. AS MUCH AS WE CAN EXPAND ACCESS TO TREATMENT AS MUCH AS WE CAN ASK OF A TO TO TO BE ABLE TO TELL PEOPLE WE CARE ABOUT THEM BECOMING WITH A BLACK EYE. YOU MIGHT GET ASKED ABOUT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE YOU COMING CLEARLY HAVING NEEDING A SHOWER THAT MIGHT ALSO BE PROVIDED AS SOMEBODY WHO WORKED IN SOCIAL WORK IN A LONG TIME AND ADDICTIONS FOR A LONG TIME. I CAN TELL YOU THE NUMBER ONE THING THAT I WOULD TEACH STUDENTS AND I WOULD WORK WITH CLIENTS ON HIS IF YOU DON'T HAVE A RELATIONSHIP THEN IT'S REALLY HARD TO GET ANYBODY TO CHANGE BEHAVIOR. IF YOU THINK ABOUT YOURSELVES CHANGING ANY BEHAVIOR IS THE ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT THINGS SO THAT THAT EMPATHY THAT RELATIONSHIP THAT PEOPLE CAN ESTABLISH WHEN THEY'RE GOING INTO A MEDICALLY SUPERVISED SETTING -- WE THINK IS THE BEST WAY AGAIN TO EXPRESS DIGNITY TO EXPRESSED EVERY LIFE MATTERS AND FOR PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO GET INTO TREATMENT -- AND FOR THOSE OF US WHO HAVE SERVED ON LOCAL. ELECTED OFFICE THIS IS THE THE HEIGHT OF OF LOCAL CONTROL WE ARE TELLING. THIS THIS CITY THAT IF THEY FEEL LIKE OUR ARE OKAY TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT THIS BILL ALSO REQUIRES LAW ENFORCEMENT TO BE AT THE TABLE. AND SO THE D. A. THE MAYOR THE DEPUTY THE SHERIFF EVERYBODY WILL HAVE TO BE AT THE TABLE -- TO BE ABLE TO DECIDE IF THIS IS GONNA GO FORWARD OR NOT SO THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES THIS YEAR -- NOTHING IN THIS BILL SAYS THAT IT TO USE DRUGS IS OKAY BUT WE HAVE CERTAINLY LEARNED THAT JUST TELLING PEOPLE TO JUST SAY NOW. HAS NOT WORKED OUR APP DIMMICK IN TEN YEARS TO GROW AND IT FEELS LIKE IT'S TIME FOR US TO JUST AT LEAST TRY THIS APPROACH AS WELL AS EVERY OTHER APPROACH THAT WE HAVE IN OUR TOOLBOX. WITH ME TODAY ARE -- WITNESSES DOCTOR DAVID KAHN AND THE CAT HE SOON. AND ALSO LARA THOMAS FROM DRUG POLICY ALLIANCE THANK YOU SO AS OUR CUSTOM HAVE TWO WITNESSES IF YOU WANT ALL THREE SPEAK YOU CAN. JUST DRUG POLICY ALLIANCE'S HERE FOR ANY KIND OF TECHNICAL QUESTIONS THANK YOU SO MUCH DR. PLEASE. THANK YOU -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD AND MEMBER MY NAME'S DOCTOR DAVID KAHN AND I REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA SOCIETY OF ADDICTION MEDICINE. SEE SAM FOR SHORT REPRESENTS OVER FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY PHYSICIANS AND ALLIED HEALTH PROFESSIONALS WE ARE THE VOICE OF ADDICTION TREATMENT FOR CALIFORNIA. WE'RE ALSO CO SPONSORS OF THIS VERY IMPORTANT LEGISLATION. ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE LEARNED THE PHYSICIANS THAT CHANGE TAKES TIME. AND IN ORDER TO MAKE CHANGE YOU NEED TO HAVE ENGAGEMENT WITH PEOPLE WHO CAN HELP YOU. WE NEED TO MATCH AVAILABILITY OF TREATMENT SERVICES WITH THE MAN. I'VE SAID ONCE BEFORE THAT I WORRY MUCH MORE ABOUT THE PATIENT THAT I DON'T SEE THAN THE ONE THAT I DO SEE. BECAUSE THE ONE THAT I DON'T SEE WE LOSE THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMMUNICATE TO IDENTIFY GOALS AND MAKE CHANGES IN THEIR LIVES. AND THIS UP OVERDOSE PREVENTION PROGRAM REPRESENTS A PART OF THE SPECTRUM OF CARE. AND CRITICALLY A PART OF THE SPECTRUM OF CARE OF THE PATIENTS THAT WE MISS THE ONES WHO ARE AT HIGHEST RATE FOR OVERDOSED. THE ONES WHO ARE MOST LIKELY TO SUFFER AS A RESULT OF THEIR ILLNESS. I PERSONALLY VISITED THE ENCYCLOPEDIA VANCOUVER WERE MUCH OF THE RESEARCH IS DERIVED IN IN THAT CLINIC I SAW A CLINIC THAT REMINDED ME OF MY SAN FRANCISCO. BE A METHADONE PROGRAM IT WAS A COMMUNITY WHERE PEOPLE CARED ABOUT IT. AND IT WAS IN THE INTEREST OF THE PATIENT STEP PARTICIPATED. IN ORDER TO GET THEM TO THEIR OPTIMAL OUR STATE IS VERY CLEAR WITH OVERDOSE PREVENTION PROGRAMS IT REDUCES OVERALL DRUG USE DISCARDED SYRINGES HIV AND HEPATITIS C. INFECTIONS. OVERDOSE DEATHS AND PEOPLE WHO PARTICIPATE IN OVERDOSE PREVENTION PROGRAMS ARE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO ENTER TREATMENT IF SOMEBODY PARTICIPATES WITH IN SUCH A PROGRAM. THEY HAVE ENCOUNTER WITH A HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL WHO CARES ABOUT THEM AS A PERSON. WE OFFER THE IDEA OF TREATMENT THEY'RE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO LISTEN. OVERDOSE PREVENTION PROGRAMS IS TREATMENT. THERE'S NO CONFLICT BETWEEN SUPERVISE USE AND STOPPING DRUGS IT'S PART OF THE CONTINUUM OF CARE AND I STRONGLY SUPPORT HARM REDUCTION BECAUSE WE THINK OF ABSTINENCE AS PART OF A HARM REDUCTION IT IS. BUT IT HAPPENS TO BE THE HARDEST WAY TO ACHIEVE IT WHEN YOU GET PEOPLE ENGAGE WITH AN OVERDOSE PREVENTION PROGRAMS YOUR OFFERING THEM TREATMENT. BOTH FOR THE ADDICTION ITSELF AND THE CO MORBID MEDICAL CONDITIONS THAT OCCUR AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER EGGMAN RIP REFERENCED ABSCESSES COMMUNICABLE DISEASES DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. AND SO IN SUMMARY I WOULD SAY THAT OVERDOSE PREVENTION PROGRAMS DO ALL OF THE ABOVE. IT ENGAGES PEOPLE IT GIVES THEM THE OPPORTUNITY CHANGE AND ROUTE AND SEAMLESSLY GETS THEM INTO THE TREATMENT THAT THEY NEED AT THE LEVEL THAT THE READY FOR THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO LISTEN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS VICTOR EYES IN AND I AM THE S. C. E. O. FOR HEALTH RIGHT THREE SIXTY WE'RE ONE OF THE LARGEST -- COMMUNITY BASED SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT PROVIDER ORGANIZATION SERVING THE MEDICAL POPULATION IN CALIFORNIA WE OPERATE PROGRAMS IN SOME OF YOUR DISTRICTS -- BUT WE ARE OUR HOME BASE IS SAN FRANCISCO WE'VE BEEN VERY ACTIVE IN IN THIS CONVERSATION. I'M ALSO REPRESENTING I CAN'T BE WHICH IS THE STATE ASSOCIATION OF TRIGGER PROVIDERS BOTH HEALTH RIGHT THREE SIXTY AND CAT PEE ARE STRONG SUPPORTERS AND SPONSORS. OF THIS LEGISLATION. I ALSO SPEAK HEROIN USER -- AND I BRING THAT TO BEAR AND ALL OF MY THINKING ABOUT THE WORK THAT I DO EVERY DAY AND HAVE BEEN DOING FOR THE PAST THIRTY YEARS. I THINK YOU'RE WELL AWARE CAN OPEN NEWSPAPER TODAY AND NOT READ ABOUT THE OPIOID -- OVERDOSE CRISIS IN OUR COUNTRY THAT CRISIS HAS NOT SKIP CALIFORNIA -- NEARLY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE DIED OF AN OVERDOSE IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND SAN FRANCISCO WHICH IS WHERE WE'RE REALLY FOCUSING THIS PILOT -- NEARLY A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE DIED IN THE SAME YEAR. SO -- IN THIS PROJECT WERE REALLY THINKING ABOUT REACHING THE HARDEST TO REACH PEOPLE THAT THERE ARE TO REACH WE SERVE LOTS OF PEOPLE IN TREATMENT PROGRAMS. WE DO A GOOD JOB WE'RE VERY INVESTED IN CONTINUING THAT AND YET THERE ARE STILL A POPULATION OF PEOPLE FOR WHOM WE ARE NOT ABLE TO REACH AND WE SEE THIS IS THE AVENUE. AS DOCTOR CONCERT WE SEE THIS IS THE AVENUE TO HELP REACH THOSE PEOPLE I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE MYTHS. AROUND THE OVERDOSE PREVENTION PROGRAMS THAT YOU MAY HAVE HEARD ABOUT OR THAT YOU MAY EVEN CONSIDERING YOUR OWN THINKING ONE IS THAT THESE PROGRAMS ENABLE DRUG USE -- THERE IS A BELIEF THAT WE NEED TO MAKE THINGS REALLY REALLY DIFFICULT AND WE NEED. TO IMPOSE A CRIMINAL SANCTIONS AND BRING A GREAT DEAL OF MISERY TO PEOPLE SO THAT THEY STOP USING DRUGS AND THAT'S HOW THEY COME TO RECOVERY WHEN IN FACT HAVING DONE THIS WORK FOR A REALLY LONG TIME. THAT IS ACTUALLY NOT THE PATH FOR PEOPLE TO RECOVERY IT IS THROUGH RELATIONSHIP AND CONNECTION AND IT'S TO HOPE THAT PEOPLE MOVE TO RECOVERY THE PEOPLE THAT WE SEE. AND THE PEOPLE THAT WE WOULD FOCUS THIS PROJECT ON IT IS NO MORE DESPAIR THAT WE CAN BRING TO BEAR ON THEIR LIVES THERE'S ONLY DEATH THAT'S REALLY THE ONLY. OTHER OPTION LEFT SO SO THIS ISN'T ENABLE IT THIS JUST MAKES US HELPS US CONTACT PEOPLE WHO ARE THE HARDEST TO REACH. I THINK THE SECOND MATTHEW HERE IS THAT THESE ATTRACT THANK YOU BUT THIS ATTRACTS CRIME -- AND THIS IS NOT BEEN PROVEN TRUE IN ANY SITE WHERE THEY'VE EXISTED OVER A HUNDRED OF THEM AROUND THE WORLD AND ACTUALLY WE ARE YOU KNOW IN HARM REDUCTION SITES THAT OPERATE CURRENTLY AND MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES. IT'S NOT TRUE THERE IS WELL PEOPLE ARE DRUG DEALERS ARE NOT ATTRACTED TO COME TO NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS BECAUSE THEY THINK THAT'S WHERE THE DRUG USERS ARE THAT HAS NOT BEEN PROVEN TO BE TRUE. IN HARM REDUCTION SITES AS WELL IN THE FINAL MYTH IS THAT THERE WERE WERE GIVEN A FALSE CHOICE THAT SAYS IT'S EITHER THIS OR TREATMENT. AND NOT NOTHING IN THIS BILL SAYS THAT WE DON'T SUPPORT TREATMENT THERE'S NOTHING IN HERE THAT SAYS WE'RE GONNA TAKE MONEY AWAY OR RESOURCES AWAY. FROM TREATMENT. IN FACT WE THINK THIS IS ACTUALLY A PART OF TREATMENT AND ALL I CAN SAY IS. IF A PERSON OVERDOSES THEY REALLY DO HAVE INADVERTENT THEY OVERDOSING DIE THEY NEVER HAVE ANOTHER CHANCE OF RECOVERY SO I STRONGLY URGE YOU TO CONSIDER SUPPORTING THIS BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER SUPPORT.

GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN VERSE CHORUS ALSO HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION. RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL WE'RE OPPOSED -- TO AB ONE EIGHTY SIX WHICH WAS VETOED LAST YEAR AND A REMAIN UNFORTUNATELY IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL WE JUST FRANKLY HAVE A HARD TIME RECONCILING THE NOTION THAT PROTECTING AND ENCOURAGING DRUG USE -- WILL HELP WITH OUR STATES MANY% DRUG PROBLEMS -- I THINK THAT WAS EMBLEMATIC OF THE GOVERNOR'S VETO MESSAGE LAST YEAR I DON'T SPEAK FOR HIM OBVIOUSLY BUT HE HE MADE SOME PRETTY -- COGENT ARGUMENTS AGAINST -- THIS BILL FRANKLY MOST IF NOT ALL OF THE ACTIVITIES THAT ARE ABSOLVED FROM CRIMINAL LIABILITY UNDER THIS BILL. REMAIN ILLEGAL UNDER FEDERAL LAW SO WE'RE SETTING UP THE CITY AND COUNTY -- AND MAYBE THEY DON'T MIND ABOUT THIS BUT YOU'RE SETTING UP THE CITY AND COUNTY -- FOR INSTEAD FIGHT BETWEEN STATE AND FEDERAL LAW -- AND THE CHALLENGES THAT WILL COME FROM THAT AND FRANKLY DESPITE THE BILL'S ATTEMPT TO PROTECT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FROM LIABILITY. WE FEAR IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE PERSON WHO UTILIZES ONE OF THESE PLACES -- WILL LEAVE THE FACILITY THERE IS NO REQUIREMENT THAT A PERSON WHO UTILIZES A SAFE INJECTION SITE OR AN OVERDOSE PREVENTION PROGRAM -- WILL STAY UNTIL THEY ARE NO LONGER UNDER THE INFLUENCE AND SO -- THIS DOES NOT ABSOLVE A PERSON FROM DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE ILLEGALLY BUT IT CERTAINLY CREATES A SITUATION WHERE WE THINK IT'S LIKELY THAT SOMEONE WILL COME TO THE ONE OF THESE FACILITIES -- USED THEIR SUBSTANCES AND LEAVE WHILE STILL UNDER THE INFLUENCE PUTTING THE REST THE MOTORING PUBLIC AT RISK NECK THAT'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF OUR CONCERN IN THAT REGARD SO -- FOR THOSE REASONS WE REMAIN OPPOSED TO THE THANK YOU. SO MY TWO WITNESSES AS YOU KNOW SO. WELL MY NAME IS FRANKLY I AM FROM THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA OVER THE BAY AREA DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIA COALITION AGAINST TWO THAT'S WHY WE GOT A WHOLE BUNCH OF RESIDENTS FROM SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA. TO COME HERE ALL THE WAY TO SAY NO TO THIS BILL NO DATE THE MAIN REASON OF THE PROPONENT IS THAT THE WE WE DO USE. DRUG OVERDOSE DEATH CASES BUT ACTUALLY IS CERTAINLY WRONG YOU KNOW ACCORDING TO BRITISH COLUMBIA CORONERS SERVICES. THE OVERDOSE THE TRUCK OVERDOSE DEATH CASES ACTUALLY. INCREASE OUR HUNT THE HOUSE IN PERCENT OR ACTUALLY A TEN TIMES YOU KNOW IN THE TEN YEARS SELF OPERATIONS ALL OF THE INJECTION CENTER AND BE A MAKEOVER. THAT MEANS IS A BIG FAILURE AND ALSO THIS BILL DOES NOT BE CLAUDIA -- THE ANY DRUG ADDICTS TO GOAL FOR TRUCK WE HABITATION RIGHT AFTER DOING INJECTION SO THAT MEANS IT JUST ENCOURAGES THEM -- TO TO DO MORE INJECTION TO USE MY THE CAKE IT THIS BILL IS ACTUALLY TAILOR MADE FOR DRUG TRAFFICKING -- GANGSTERS AND ALSO FOR DRUG ADDICTS SO WE STRONGLY OPPOSED -- TO AB THREE SIXTY TWO AND ACCORDING TO THE GOVERNOR OF OF OF THE LAST -- GOVERNOR BROWN WE NEED A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH AT BOTH THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL AND THE DISADVANTAGES OF THIS BIãU FAR AWAY AND THE POSSIBLE BENEFITS. THANK YOU. JOHN LEVEL ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA NARCOTICS OFFICERS ASSOCIATION. WE WOULD COMMAND EVERYONE. TO A CLOSE EXAMINATION OF GOVERNOR BROWN'S VERY THOUGHTFUL VETO OF THIS BILL LAST YEAR. THE ISSUE WITH THIS BILL IS THAT IT DOES NOT PROVIDE A COG NICE SYBIL ROUTE TO TREATMENT. MISSING FROM THE BILL IS ANY DISCUSSION FOR EXAMPLE OF METHADONE ALTERNATIVES. MISSING FROM THE BILL IS SKINNY DIRECTIVE TO THE OPERATORS OF THE INJECTION CENTER. TO EXAMINE SOMEONE AFTER THEY SHOOTS UP SHOOT UP TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE NOT SO IMPAIRED THAT THEY MIGHT DO HARM TO THEMSELVES OR OTHERS. WHEN THEY DEPART? MISSING FROM THE BILL IS HE ANY SIRIUS LOOK AT THE IN A AT THE LOW CITING AND LOCATION PROBLEMS. OF WHERE THE SITES THE EXPERIENCE WITH THE INSIGHT IN VANCOUVER. YOU WILL FIND A COUPLE OF THINGS YES THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO USE THE INJECTION SITE. BUT MOST OF THE PEOPLE ACTUALLY WHAT'S HAPPENED IS IS. INSIGHT HAS BECOME A MAGNET. FOR OF A DRAMATIC INCREASE IN STREET DRUG ACTIVITY AND IN FACT IS MISTER LEE INDICATED. THE NUMBER OF OVERDOSE DEATHS SINCE INSIDE HAS BEEN IN PLACE OF ACTUALLY GONE UP -- IN THAT REGION GOVERNOR BROWN HAD IT RIGHT YOU CANNOT SIMPLY BE ENABLE. OF ADDICTIVE BEHAVIOR AND EXPECT TO GET A A A GOOD RESULT I PERMISSION TO SAY WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SAY. MY WIFE IS A RECOVERING ALCOHOLIC WITH SHE WILL HAVE THIRTY THREE YEARS OF SOBRIETY ON APRIL FOURTH. AND AND SHE IS A REAL EXPERT NOT AN ACADEMIC ON THIS WOULD SHE HAS SAID TO ME IS THAT YOU DON'T GET PEOPLE. CLEAN BY ENABLING THEM TO CONTINUE -- TO USE THE DRUGS YOU HAVE TO HAVE ROBUST INTERVENTIONS TO GET PEOPLE INTO TREATMENT TO HELP GET PEOPLE SOBRE. THOSE ELEMENTS AS WELL INTENTIONED AS THIS BILL IS ARE MISSING -- FROM FROM THE BILL AND THAT WAS THE GRAVEL MEN OF GOVERNOR BROWN'S EXCELLENT AND FOUGHT FULL VETO MESSAGE LAST YEAR WHICH WE WOULD STRONGLY COMMAND TO THIS COMMITTEE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF A LOT OF THE FACT THAT YOU THREE WITNESSES SPOKE -- AND WE WERE STILL ABOUT A MINUTE LEFT AND WENT ALLOW IF MISS LAURA THOMAS IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING YOU'D LIKE TO SAVE ALLOW YOU TO TESTIFY. FOR A MINUTE. THANK YOU CHAIR WOULD. I THINK -- AS BOTH OF THE THE EXPERT WITNESSES HERE HAVE STATED. THERE'S NOT ONLY A VERY STRONG RESEARCH BASIS FOR THESE PROGRAMS WITH A BàN EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE IN ESSENTIALLY ANY DEMAND THAT YOU CAN ADDRESS WHETHER IT'S AROUND. AND NEIGHBORHOOD CRIME OR CONNECTING PEOPLE TO TREATMENT OR JUST PROVIDING PEOPLE WITH SOME DIGNITY AND RESPECT -- THAT THEY MAY NOT EASILY FIND -- IN THEIR LIVES GIVEN THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES BUT IT'S ALSO TRUE THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE WHO FIND THEMSELVES INJECTING ON THE STREETS IN SAN FRANCISCO VERY MUCH WANT THEY DO NOT WANT TO BE INJECTING ON THE STREETS THEY WOULD LIKE TO HAVE. AN INDOOR PLACE -- THEY WOULD LIKE TO BE THEY WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SOME CHANGES IN THEIR LIVES THIS IS A ISSUE THAT WE HAVE DISCUSSED AND DEBATED IN SAN FRANCISCO FOR OVER A DECADE. AT THIS POINT AND THE MOST RECENT POLLING FROM THE SAN FRANCISCO CHAMBER OF COMMERCE FOUND THAT 77% OF PEOPLE POLLED SUPPORTED THIS IN SAN FRANCISCO SO ON BEHALF OF MY FELLOW SAN FRANCISCO RESIDENTS -- WE ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS THANK YOU.

SEE KNOWN A BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS [inaudible] MASON -- SEGMENT YEAH. WE'VE GOT A CAUCUS RECOMMENDATION OF OF OPPOSING I'VE GOT STAFF -- RECOMMENDATION OF OPPOSING -- BECAUSE I'VE SERVED WITH YOU THE LAST FOUR YEARS AND YOU'VE TAKEN ON SOME VERY HEAVY ISSUES -- THAT OTHERS WOULD NOT WANT TO TAKE ON A BECAUSE OF THE POLITICAL WEIGHT. AND THAT COMES ALONG WITH THEM I HAVE A IN A DEEP REGARD BECAUSE OF YOUR OF YOUR WORK I WANT TO TAKE A LOOK. AT THIS A LITTLE A LITTLE DEEPER THE THAT I WOULD OPPOSE AS WELL -- BUT I KNOW THAT YOU WOULDN'T HAVE BROUGHT SOMETHING FORD IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE COMPASSION -- FOR FOR INDIVIDUALS AND WANTED TO BE ABLE TO TO FIGURE OUT WAYS OF TRYING TO SAVE THEIR LIVES INSIDE THANK YOU. FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD BUT THERE THERE WAS A QUESTION THAT I DID HAVE A IN REGARDS -- TO THE GOVERNOR'S VETO MESSAGE IF IT'S OKAY FOR ME JUST TO READ THEM ONE QUICK LINE HERE HE HE SAID IN HIS VETO MESSAGE LAST YEAR AFTER GREAT REFLECTION I CONCLUDED THE DISADVANTAGES OF THIS BILL. FAR OUTWEIGH THE POSSIBLE BENEFITS FUNDAMENTALLY I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT ENABLING ILLEGAL DRUG USE AND GOVERNMENT SPONSORED OBJECTION CENTERS. WITH NO CORRESPONDING REQUIREMENT THAT THE USER UNDER GROW TREATMENT WILL REDUCE DRUG ADDICTION AND I THINK THAT THAT'S REALLY THE CRUX OF THE MATTER -- IF I WAS THE VOTE HI TO MOVE THIS BILL ALONG -- I WOULD WANT SOME LEVEL OF CERTAINTY THAT THIS BILL WAS GOING TO PROVIDE THE GREATEST -- POSSIBILITY FOR PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO TO REGAIN THEIR LIVES FROM THE DRUG ADDICTION. BUT DO WE DOES THERE NEED TO BE MORE CONSTRAINTS LIKE THE GOVERNOR BROUGHT UP LAST YEAR TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE FOLKS ARE GOING TO MAKE SURE TO GET SOME HELP. THAT THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR THOUGHTFULNESS AND AND AND THANK YOU FOR HAVING AN OPEN MIND -- I THINK I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS COMPELLING AND I YOU KNOW WE CERTAINLY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE GOVERNOR'S VETO MESSAGE LAST YEAR AND AND CERTAINLY -- THAT THE OPPOSITION YOU KNOW THOSE WAS THERE THAT WAS THEIR MESSAGE TO HIM -- BUT I THINK YOU HEARD FROM EVERY ADDICTION SPECIALIST IN THE STATE YOU'VE HEARD FROM EVERYBODY WHO WORKS IN THIS AREA YOU'VE HEARD FROM. THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. THAT THEY SUPPORT THIS APPROACH TO TREATMENT. AGAIN WE SEE THIS AS TREATMENT KEEPING SOMEBODY ALIVE ANOTHER DAY IS A FORM OF TREATMENT IF SOMEBODY OVERDOSES AND GO TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM WE DON'T SAY WE'RE NOT GOING TO REVIVE YOU. IN LESS YOU PROMISE RIGHT NOW YOU'RE GOING TO TREATMENT IF SOMEBODY GOES IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM AND THEY BEEN A VICTIM OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WE DON'T SAY WE'RE NOT GOING TO HELP YOU UNLESS YOU AGREE RIGHT NOW. THAT YOU'RE GONNA LEAVE LUKE LEAVE YOUR USER WE DON'T DO THINGS LIKE THAT BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND THAT -- THAT KIND OF COERCION AND THAT KIND OF HOLDING SOMEBODY'S LIFE IN THE PALM OF YOUR HAND FOR YOU TO BE ABLE TO DECIDE WHAT THEY SHOULD DO. IS NOT AFFECTED TO GET PEOPLE INTO TREATMENT. WITH THE RESEARCH HAS SHOWN US IS THAT PEOPLE WHO USUALLY CENTERS GOING TO TREATMENT MORE FREQUENTLY THAN PEOPLE WHO ARE JUST USING ON THE STREETS. AND THIS IS A PILOT PROJECT JUST IN THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO IS THAT IS CORRECT AND IT IS LIKE AND THE CITY AND COUNTY -- THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS DID THEY TAKE A FORMAL POSITION ON THIS WAS THERE ANY OPPOSITION I'M FROM ANY OF THE THE THE BUT THE BOARD MEMBERS NOT TO NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE IT WAS IT WAS IT WAS -- THEY THINK UNANIMOUS STATE THEY HAVE BEEN AT YOU KNOWS ANYBODY WHO'S CLOSE A SAN FRANCISCO RIGHT NOW THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY HAVE AN INCREASE PROBLEM RIGHT NOW AND AND YOU. KNOW I THINK 77% -- I'VE HAD LATELY AND I'VE HEARD FROM YOU NURSES DOCTORS PEOPLE WHO SAY IT IS A DIFFICULT TO WALK OUTSIDE NOW WITHOUT STEPPING OVER A NEEDLE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. IT'S A PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE THAT WERE THAT WERE FACING WITH SO NOT ONLY HOPEFULLY ARE WE PROVIDING COMPASSION AND A PATH TO TREATMENT A PATH TO DIGNITY FOR THOSE WHO ARE USING. BUT WE'RE ALSO PROVIDING SOME RELIEF HOPEFULLY TO NEIGHBORHOODS TO THE OVERWHELMED OFTENTIMES POLICE AND FIRE AND EMERGENCY ROOMS THAT ARE TAKING UP WAY TOO MUCH OF THEIR TIME. BEING CALLED TO OVERDOSE ON STREETS VERSUS BEING ABLE TO TO DO THE WORK THAT WE WANTED TO DO IT IN FIGHTING CRIME AND SAVING LIVES. IS THERE ANY FEAR AT ALL THAT THIS IS GOING TO HAVE ANY NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES IT'LL ACTUALLY DO MORE HARM. THAN IT WOULD THEN IT WOULD GOOD. WHAT WE HAVE DECADES OF RESEARCH FROM AROUND THE WORLD THAT HAS SHOWN THAT THAT NOT THAT NOT TO BE TRUE -- THAT PUBLIC USE TENDS TO GO DOWN THAT -- POLICE OFFICERS OFTENTIMES PUBLIC SAFETY WILL ENGAGE IN RELATIONSHIP THEY SEE SOMEONE USING IT'LL SAY YOU KNOW THIS IS A SAFE PLACE OVER HERE THAT YOU CAN USE -- YOU KNOW WHEN WE SAY IT'S ENABLING LETTING SOMEONE CHEWED UP IN A GUTTER OR IN A PLAYGROUND -- THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S NOT AN OPTION I DON'T THINK THAT THAT ANYBODY WOULD WANT TO SAY THAT IS WHAT YOU NEED TO DO VERSUS GOING SOMEPLACE THAT IS MEDICALLY SUPERVISED WE CAN BE TREATED WITH DIGNITY. AND BEING REFERRED TO SERVICES REFER TO AGAIN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE YOU HAVE AN ABSCESS YOU KNOW A AN ABSCESS ON A ON A TOWER PEOPLE OFTEN TIMES USING THEY CAN'T FIND ANY OTHER VANS. THAT CAN LEAD TO A LOSS OF A FOOT. AND THEN YOU HAVE SOMEBODY IN A WHEELCHAIR ON THE STREETS STOPPING TRAFFIC I MEAN THE AMOUNT OF COMORBIDITY THAT GOES ALONG WITH IV DRUG USE AND AN ABJECT POVERTY AND LIVING THEY ARE ALREADY AT THE HIGHEST RISK FOR ALL KINDS. OF COMMUNICABLE DISEASES -- AND JUSTICE DID COMORBIDITY THAT GOES ALONG WITH THAT SO AGAIN TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A RELATIONSHIP TO BE ABLE TO GET REFER TO A TREATMENT TO BE ABLE TO FIX AN ABSCESS ALL OF THOSE THINGS WE SEE AS POSITIVE. AND AGAIN YOU START THAT RELATIONSHIP PEOPLE ARE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO GET IN HE GOT THE DIRECTOR OF ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROGRAMS -- IN SAN FRANCISCO IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WAS SAYING THIS IS GOOD THIS IS THE KIND A WRAPAROUND SERVICE THAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO REACH THE VERY HARDEST TO REACH. I MEAN MAYBE JUST TELLING SOMEBODY JUST SAY NO MIGHT HAVE WORKED WHEN SOMEBODY'S A TEENAGER SMOKING A LITTLE WEED. BUT I THINK WHEN PEOPLE HAVE -- GOT TO THE POINT WHERE THEY ARE LIVING ON THE STREETS USING ON THE STREETS -- SELLING THEIR BODIES -- TO BE ABLE TO TO GET THEIR NEXT FIX THAT IS SOMETHING I THINK AS IF WE'RE HUMANITARIANS WE WANT TO ENGAGE WITH THAT WE WANT TO SAY WE DON'T WANT TO SEE THAT NOT NOT ON OUR CITIES NOT ON OUR STREETS. WHEN THERE'S WHEN THERE ARE RESEARCH -- DRIVEN OPTIONS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO USE AND IN THE CITY AND COUNTY WILL PROVIDE SUPERVISION IS THAT IS THAT CORRECTAND THEY'RE READY FOR THAT THEY'RE GOING TO FUND IT THEY'RE GONNA. THAT'S CORRECT AND AS IT WILL SEE THIS AS SAVINGS TURNING ANOTHER THEY'RE ALL OF THE SING THAT THEY THIS PILOT THANK YOU. THANK YOU IS THAT I'M HAVING THE COURAGE OF YOUR CONVICTIONS TO BRING THIS BILL AGAIN CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG LAST YEAR THIS WAS A STATEWIDE BILL. THAT WAS NARROWED DOWN TO THE COUNTY AND CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO LAST YEAR WE STARTED WITH A WITH A TRIAL OF WE'D NOT TO EXCEED TEN COUNTIES WHO WOULD OPT INTO AGAIN IT WAS NEVER TOP DOWN IT WAS ALWAYS SAYING. IF YOUR ISSUE FEELS LIKE THIS WOULD BE A GOOD OPTION FOR YOU THEN WITH YOUR LAW ENFORCEMENT WITH YOUR PUBLIC HEALTH WITH YOUR TREATMENT PROVIDERS YOU CAN ASSESS. IF THIS IS SOMETHING WE NARROWED IT DOWN EVEN FURTHER TO JUST THE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO WHICH WAS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE GOVERNOR HER **** I MEAN CAN WE JUST DO IT SOME PLACE WHERE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE. OPPOSED TO IT WHICH IS WHICH IS WHERE WE GOT AND WHITE NOW WE'RE HERE AGAIN WITH JUST A SIX YEAR SUNSET AND WITH THE ANNUAL REPORT BACK. THANK YOU I I ASK BECAUSE IT'S A QUESTION THAT CAME UP -- ONCE THE GOVERNOR HAD VETOED. LAST YEAR'S BILL THERE ARE SOME FOLKS IN AN ALLEY COUNTY THAT SAID WE ACTUALLY COULD REALLY USE A PILOT PROJECT JUST LIKE THIS BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW LA COUNTY SKID ROW. THERE'S A LOT OF ISSUES OF HOMELESSNESS AND YOUNG PEOPLE AND IF AND AND HAVING CONVERSATION WITH FOLKS INSANE I NEED HELP AND I CAN'T. DO THIS ON MY OWN I NEED A PLACE WHERE I CAN GET A FIX BUT ALSO HAVE SOMEBODY READILY AVAILABLE TO ME TO HELP ME GET THROUGH THIS PROCESS. AND I THINK THAT'S LOOKING AT THIS ISSUE FROM A VERY FULL WELL THAT WHAT WE HAVE DONE IN THE PAST HAS NOT WORKED. AND SO I JUST WANT TO COMMEND YOU FOR BRINGING THIS AGAIN UP TO US AND IT'S IT'S AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU. THE SUMMATION OF THE QUESTION YEAH JUST TO MAKE SURE SO WITH PUBLIC SAFETY CHRIS WHO GOT THE NARCOTICS OFFICERS ASSOCIATION IS TEACHERS ASSOCIATION -- IS THERE IS THERE SOME WAY TO BE ABLE TO GET THEM -- IT THAT BECAUSE IT IS A PILOT PROJECT TO JUSTIN -- ONE CITY AND COUNTY AND IF THIS IS GONNA HAVE BENEFITS WHY WOULDN'T -- BUT THE PUBLIC SAFETY ORGANIZATIONS BE BE SUPPORTIVE. YOU KNOW SOMETIMES OLD IDEAS ARE HARD TO CHANGE AND OLD WAYS OF THINKING ABOUT THINGS ARE HARD TO CHANGE BUT CERTAINLY I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT. THAT WE THAT WE SEE THAT WE HAVE EVIDENCE OF IS WHAT WE'RE CURRENTLY DOING. IS NOT REACHING EVERYBODY -- SO WE DID TAKE AMENDMENTS INTO THE BILL OR WE DID DO THE BILL THIS YEAR THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS TO BE AT THE TABLE. AND SO AND AND TO MISS CORREOS POINT -- BLESS ANGEL CERTAINLY HAS ASKED ABOUT IT BUT THERE WAS STILL SOME RESISTANCE AND WE AGAIN WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANT IMPOSES ON ANYBODY IF ANOTHER COUNTY OR CITY WANTS TO COME FORWARD. AFTER THEY SEE WHAT SAN FRANCISCO'S DONE BECAUSE WE DO KNOW THAT THE LA COUNTY HAS SUBSISTENCE SEVERE -- ISSUES THAT THEY'RE DEALING WITH ALSO THEY WOULD HAVE TO TO OPT INTO SOMETHING LIKE THIS SO WE FEEL LIKE WE'VE DONE. EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN TO BE ABLE -- TO GIVE LAW ENFORCEMENT A SEAT AT THE TABLE -- AND AND SO SAN FRANCISCO FEELS LIKE THEY'RE THEY'VE HAD A SEAT AT THE TABLE NEVER TO GO FORWARD. THANK YOU IF YOU HAVE HEARD -- YOU'VE CONVINCED ME AT TODAY TO MOVE THIS BILL THE FORD -- I DO THINK BECAUSE IT'S A LIMITED A PILOT PROJECT THE SUPPORT OF LOCAL LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND WITH THE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT BEING HAVING A SEAT AT THE TABLE -- I THINK IT'S A WHERE THE IDEA TO BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD. THANK YOU MISTER MAYES. CAN I TAKE THAT AS A MOTION MISTER MISTRESS OKAY WE HAVE A MOTION BY MISTER MESA SECOND FIVE IS CARILLO. WHICH I CLOSER SEGMENT -- JUST THANK EVERYBODY FOR THE FOB THOUGHTFUL DISCUSSION THE THE DEDICATION OF THE ACTIVISTS IN THE ADVOCATES -- AND JUST JUST FOR YOU TO KNOW I MEAN THE THE CARDS AND LETTERS THAT I GET THAT JUST PEOPLE SAYING THANK YOU FOR SPEAKING FOR THOSE OF US WHO HAVE NO VOICE -- AND I'D CERTAINLY NOT AS ALIGNING MYSELF -- FOR COMPARING MYSELF AT ALL -- TO MOTHER TERESA BUT IF WE THINK SHOULDN'T JUST SAY I JUST WANT TO GO WORK WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE YOU KNOW AT JUST READY TO PULL THEMSELVES UP BY THEIR BOOTSTRAPS AND GET ON YOU HAVE TO GO OUT INTO THE STREET YOU HAVE TO MEET PEOPLE WHERE THEY ARE. IN ORDER TO AND TREAT THEM WITH LOVE AND COMPASSION AND THAT'S HOW WE CHANGE LIVES AND THAT'S HOW WE MAKE OUR COMMUNITIES BETTER I RESPECTFULLY ASK DR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR SEGMENT AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THE BILL FOR IT I KNOW HOW HARD YOU WORKED ON THIS THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS -- I'D YOU KNOW AS YOU SAID SO SO ELOQUENTLY -- WE CAN'T CONTINUE TO TO DO THE SAME THING AND EXPECT DIFFERENT RESULTS RIGHT I'M FREEZING MY OWN PRISON OF MY OWN WAY BUT THE CLEARLY WHAT WE'RE DOING IS NOT REACHING EVERYONE. AND IF THIS REACHES A FEW PEOPLE AND IT SAVE SOME LIVES THAN THAN I HAVE TO CONSIDER IT IS IT IS AS MORE THAN WORTHWHILE SO IF THIS BELIEVES A COMMITTEE TODAY I'D LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR AND I WANNA THANK YOU FOR YOUR EFFORTS.

FIVE SEVENTY SEVEN IS A BILL WHICH WOULD EXTEND MEDI CAL ELIGIBILITY FOR WOMEN POST PREGNANCY DEALING WITH PREGNANCY RELATED. OR POST PARTUM MENTAL HEALTH DIAGNOSIS IF THE BILL. THANK YOU CURRENTLY EIGHT STATE AND FEDERAL PROGRAMS -- WOMEN WHO ARE PREGNANT ARE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE -- BUT OFTENTIMES THE CARE THAT THEY REQUIRE EXCEEDS THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT THEY ARE ELIGIBLE AND WE CERTAINLY KNOW IT IS OBVIOUS THAT MATERNAL HEALTH IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF RAISING HEALTHY CHILDREN. AND A KEY ASPECT TO OUR SOCIAL SAFETY NET. THIS EGGMAN FORCE EXPANDED COVERAGE ONLY LAST MAKE ANYBODY CHOOSE MEDI CAL BUT THIS CERTAINLY SAYS THAT IF YOU'RE FOR DEALING WITH ISSUES THAT THE MEDIC HELP PERIOD SHOULD BE EXTENDED SO THAT YOU CAN TAKE CARE OF YOUR MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. SO THAT YOU CAN. BE THE BEST YOU CAN BE FOR YOUR YOUNG CHILD -- AND WITH ME TODAY -- I HAVE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. I THANK YOU MY NAME IS DR CHRISTOPHER BEATTY. I AM AN OBGYN IN FRESNO CALIFORNIA I AM THE DEPARTMENT CHAIR OF SPECIALLY MEDICINE FOR CALIFORNIA HEALTH SCIENCES UNIVERSITY. COLLEGE OF OSTEOPATHIC MEDICINE -- I AM HERE -- REPRESENTING A COG DISTRICT -- NINE WE ARE SPONSORING THIS BILL. AND I JUST WANT TO SHARE SOME -- INSIGHT TO WHAT OPG LANDS ARE SEEING ON A DAILY BASIS HERE IN CALIFORNIA -- THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF OBGYN ESTIMATES THAT OVER HALF A MILLION -- PREGNANCIES -- IN THIS COUNTRY EVERY YEAR ARE AFFECTED BY A PSYCHIATRIC ILLNESS -- AND AS YOU ABOUT HALF OF ALL DELIVERIES IN CALIFORNIA EACH YEAR ARE TWO WOMEN WHO ARE COVERED BY MEDICARE. SO WITH THIS -- LARGE NUMBER OF SITE CHECK PSYCHIATRIC ILLNESSES THAT WE'RE SEEING AS PHYSICIANS AND A LARGE NUMBER OF WOMEN ON MEDI CAL -- THESE PATIENTS ARE COMING INTO OUR OFFICES WHO EITHER HAVE A PSYCHIATRIC. ILLNESS PRIOR TO PREGNANCY OR OFTENTIMES DEVELOPED IN PREGNANCY OR AFTER PREGNANCY AS YOU MAY KNOW POST PARTUM DEPRESSION IS A A PROBLEM THAT WE SEE QUITE OFTEN -- WITH THESE ILLNESSES THESE PATIENTS ARE USUALLY TREATED IN JUST ONE VISIT TO THE POSITION I CAN'T PRESCRIBE A MEDICATION. AND GIVEN THE PANEL AND SAY YOU'RE GOING TO BE FINE AND NOT SEE HIM AGAIN. CURRENTLY THESE MEDICAL PATIENTS LOSE THEIR COVERAGE AFTER SIXTY DAYS AFTER DELIVERY. THESE WOMEN HAVE NOT ONLY ISSUES OF CARING FOR THEMSELVES AND TREATING THEIR THEIR ILLNESSES BUT THOSE THOSE SAME WOMEN GO HOME AND THEIR CHILDREN SUFFER. THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO CARE FOR THEIR OWN CHILDREN. THE CURRENT BABY THAT THEY HAD THEIR OTHER CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES. THEIR JOBS SUFFER -- SO WITH THIS BILL THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO HAVE HEALTH CARE FOR A YEAR THEY CAN COME BACK TO OUR OFFICE BECAUSE THESE WOMEN DO NOT COME BACK IN OUR OFFICES -- THEY CAN COME BACK WE CAN GET THEM THE TREATMENT THEY NEED WE CAN FOLLOW UP MAKE SURE WE CAN ADJUST OUR MEDICATIONS AS NEEDED WE GET THEM COUNSELING -- AND SO -- AND AS WELL THERE'S INCREASE IN SUICIDE AS WELL AND I WANTED TO HIT ON THAT POINT QUICKLY AS WELL. THECDC DID A STUDY IN FROM NINETEEN NINETY SIXTEEN CALIFORNIA AN INCREASE IN THE SUICIDE RATE BY FOURTEEN POINT AND ABOUT HALF OF THOSE SUICIDES ARE TWO WOMEN WHO ARE AFFECTED BY MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. SO -- IF WE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR REQUEST THAT YOU SUPPORT THIS BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WITNESS. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE GOOD AFTERNOON ARLENE CALLUM DIRECTOR OF WOMEN'S AND CHILDREN'S AMBULATORY SERVICES FOR CENTER MEDICAL CENTER SACRAMENTO. HERE ON BEHALF OF THE MARCH OF DIMES IN SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY BILL. FIVE SEVENTY SEVEN ALTHOUGH THE AFFAIR AFFORDABLE CARE ACT EXPANDED THE AVAILABILITY OF MATERNITY MATERNITY CARE COVERAGE FOR WOMEN BOTH THROUGH EXCHANGE PLANS AND MEDICAID EXPANSION. THERE REMAIN SIGNIFICANT LIMITATIONS ON COVERAGE FOR POST PARTUM CARE. TRADITIONALLY WOMEN RECEIVE ONLY ONE POST PARTUM CHECK UP AT FOUR TO SIX WEEKS POST DELIVERY AND THESE ROUTINE VISITS TYPICALLY PROVIDE A LIMITED ARRAY OF SERVICES AND LIMITED COUNSELING ON YOUR CONCEPTION CARE. HOWEVER ADEQUATE POSTPARTUM COVERAGE SHOULD ENABLE NEW MOTHERS TO OBTAIN THE SERVICES THEY NEED TO ENSURE A FULL RECOVERY AND TO ENSURE THEIR NEXT PREGNANCY IF ANY CAN BE HEALTHY. THIS INCLUDES POSTPARTUM VISITS WHERE THEIR PHYSICAL EMOTIONAL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL WELL BEING CAN BE EVALUATED. UNFORTUNATELY POST PARTUM DEPRESSION AND MATERNAL MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY SIGNIFICANT HEALTH CONCERNS. MATERNAL MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS INCLUDE A RANGE OF CONDITIONS SUCH AS DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY DISORDERS AND THEY CAN CAUSE SERIOUS COMPLICATIONS DURING AND AFTER PREGNANCY THAT CAN IMPACT THE HEALTH. OF MOTHERS AND THEIR NEWBORNS. MATERNAL SOME WOMEN INFANTS AND FAMILIES INCLUDING PERPETUATING ADVERSE BIRTH OUTCOMES. IN CALIFORNIA THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH MATERNAL AND INFANT HEALTH ASSESSMENT OR ME HIGH DOCUMENTS THE PREVALENCE OF THESE CONDITIONS. ACCORDING TO THE 200-013-2152 ME HOW DATA SNAPSHOT WHICH WAS RELEASED IN JULY OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN FOURTEEN POINT 1% OF PREGNANT WOMEN EXPERIENCE PRENATAL DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS AND DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS. PREVALENCE RATES ARE HIGHER AMONG BLACK WOMEN NINETEEN POINT FOR PRENATAL FOURTEEN POINT SIX POST PARTUM HISPANIC WOMEN SEVENTEEN POINT NINE PRENATAL FIFTEEN POINT ONE POST PARTUM AND WOMEN UTILIZING MEDI CAL. NINETEEN PRENATAL AND SIXTEEN POINT SEVEN POST PARTUM WELL THESE CONDITIONS ARE COMMON ONLY ABOUT 15% OF WOMEN WITH POST PARTUM DEPRESSION RECEIVE TREATMENT I MEAN TO SAY THAT OVER AGAIN. WELL THESE CONDITIONS ARE COMMON ONLY ABOUT 15% OF WOMEN WITH POST PARTUM DEPRESSION RECEIVE TREATMENT EVEN THOUGH ABOUT 90% OF WOMEN CAN BE SUCCESSFULLY TREATED. MORE WORK IS NEEDED TO ENSURE THAT THE WOMEN ARE SUCCESSFULLY SCREEN PREFERRED AND TREATED FOR MATERNAL MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS. CALIFORNIA CAN TAKE SEVERAL STEPS IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BY ADOPTING AB FIVE SEVENTY SEVEN TO EXPAND MEDICAL COVERAGE OF POST PARTUM CARE. TO A FULL YEAR AFTER GIVING BIRTH RATHER THAN THE CURRENT LIMIT OF SIXTY DAYS FROM THE END OF PREGNANCY. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE TODAY AND I URGE YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT PROPOSAL. VERY MUCH OTHERS IN SUPPORT.

MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AB TWO TWO EIGHT CLARIFIES THAT A FOOD BEVERAGE OR COSMETIC THE CONTAINS CB DE. DERIVE FROM INDUSTRIAL HELP HIM IS NOT ADULTERATED. THIS BILL PROHIBITS RESTRICTIONS ON THESE PRODUCTS BASED SOLELY ON THE FACT THAT THEY CAN DATE CONTAIN CB DE THAT IS DERIVED FROM HIM. NOW HOW DID WE GET HERE WELL. BILL REMOVED HIM FROM ALL FTA SCHEDULES EVERY CLASSIFIED HIM AS AN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT. THIS IS OPEN THE DOORS FOR FARMERS TO CULTIVATE HIM AND AS PRESENTED CONSUMERS OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO IT X. ACCESS. CBD THAT WILL NOT RESULT IN A HIGH. LET ME CLARIFY HIM IS NOT MARIJUANA. DOES CBD CAN BE EXTRACTED FROM BOTH WHEN IS PRODUCED FROM HEMP THERE ARE NO PSYCHO. EFFECTS. THIS IS BECAUSE BY DEFINITION INDUSTRIAL HEMP ONLY CONTAINS. POINT 003% THC WHICH IS A PSYCHO ACTIVE COMPONENT IN MARIJUANA PRODUCTS. SO WE HAVE FOUND OURSELVES IN A CONUNDRUM. CALIFORNIA LEGALIZE CANNABIS NOTWITHSTANDING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S POSITION THAT CANNABIS IS ILLEGAL BUT IRONICALLY WHILE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS REMOVED BARRIERS TO THE LEGAL SALE AND USE OF HIM. DRIVE PRODUCTS CALIFORNIA LAGS BEHIND. THE MANUFACTURE AND SALE OF CB DID DERIVED FROM HIM IS RAPIDLY EXPANDING BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA WITH OVER A THOUSAND EMPLOYEES THE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF ECONOMIC PRODUCTIVITY. SHOULD THE STATE CHOOSE NOT TO CLARIFY THAT HIM SEE BEAUTY PRODUCTS ARE LEGAL FOR SALE AND CONSUMPTION. THESE JOBS AND BUSINESSES WILL BE LOST. FURTHER THE MANY CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS ALEX WILL FACE A NEW BEAR IN OBTAINING THE PRODUCT. I'M ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS AND I'M ALSO ADDING IT URGENCY CLAUSE TO THIS BILL. WE CANNOT LEAVE OUR SAID US CITIZENS FARMERS AND BUSINESSES WITH UNCERTAINTY TO THE WEATHER HIM BASED CBT MAY CONTINUE TO BE SOLD IN PURCHASING CALIFORNIA. I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE FOR AB TWO TWO EIGHT AND I HAVE TWO WITNESSES WITH ME ON BEHALF OF SUPPORTING THE BILL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS JIM GROSS ON BEHALF OF THE US HEMP ROUNDTABLE FIRST I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR. NOT ONLY ISSUE MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD BUT SHE HAS WORKED DILIGENTLY TO TRY TO ADDRESS THE CURRENT. ACTIVITIES OF THE STATE WITH RESPECT TO HOW THEY VIEW THE LEGALITY OF C. B. D. U. S. HEMP ROUNDTABLE REPRESENTS -- HUNDREDS OF ORGANIZATIONS THERE IN ALL LEVELS OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN -- AS MS AGUIAR-CURRY INDICATED -- HAMP IS ONE OF THE FASTEST GROWING INDUSTRIES IN THE UNITED STATES. AND CBT OR CANNABIS OIL IS ONE OF THE PRODUCTS THAT -- CONSUMERS ARE MOST INTERESTED IN -- WE MAKE NO HEALTH CLAIMS WITH RESPECT TO THESE PRODUCTS HOWEVER CONSUMERS HAVE SAID THAT FROM A WELLNESS STANDPOINT -- THEY BELIEVE CB DE SPEWED OVERREACH LOCALITY IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW A SIMILAR DISPUTE EXISTED IN OTHER STATES EXISTING OF THE STATE SOME STATES HAVE CLARIFIED THAT INCLUDING. COLORADO AND OREGON THAT IS WHAT WE SEEK TO DO HERE IS TO CLARIFY THAT SIMPLY BECAUSE OF AN FDA DETERMINATION ABOUT ONE DRUG HAVING CBD. ARE YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE THE RESULT THAT THE PRODUCT IS OTHERWISE ILLEGAL IN CALIFORNIA WITH THESE CHANGES WE WILL ACCOMPLISH THAT. AND WE ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS AMY JENKINS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CANNABIS INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION WE REPRESENT FIVE HUNDRED MEMBERS APPROXIMATELY SIX HUNDRED BRANDS AND FIFTEEN THOUSAND EMPLOYEES. WE ARE VERY PLEASED TO JOIN THE HEMP INDUSTRY IN SUPPORTING THIS BILL AND WE THINK THE AUTHOR FOR HER LEADERSHIP -- THIS PROVIDES A VERY SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY IN FACT FOR THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY AS WELL THEY HAVE ALREADY BEEN. CULTIVATING MANUFACTURING AND SELLING THESE PRODUCTS -- UNFORTUNATELY DUE TO SOME OF THE THE LACK OF CLARITY IN EXISTING LAW -- THERE HAVE BEEN RECENT EFFORTS TO PRECLUDE THIS TYPE OF ACTIVITY AND I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT AT A TIME WHEN THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY IS STRUGGLING. TO TO GROW ACCUSTOMED TO AND ADJUST TO OUR NEW REGULATORY REALITY -- THESE PRODUCTS ARE -- ALTERNATIVES THAT ARE WIDELY UTILIZED BY OUR CUSTOMERS AND SO WE ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT WHEN I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR HER WORK. AND I WOULD NOTE APPROXIMATELY TWELVE OTHER STATES HAVE ALREADY DEVELOPED REGULATIONS AROUND THE PRODUCTION AND SALE OF HIM AND HIM TO RIGHT PRODUCTS AND AS THE AUTHOR NOTED ARE MOVING AGGRESSIVELY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS NEW AND EMERGING ECONOMIC ACTIVITY.

COMMUNITY BENEFITS ARE THE SERVICES NONPROFIT HOSPITALS PROVIDE TO TO ADDRESS COMMUNITY NEEDS AND CAN INCLUDE SERVICES -- PROVIDED TO VULNERABLE POPULATIONS CHARITY CARE SUPPORT OF PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAMS AND DONATIONS OF FUNDS A RESOURCES THAT CONTRIBUTE TO A COMMUNITY PRIORITY. SUCH AS HOUSING. CURRENTLY HOSPITAL SUBMIT THE PLANS ARE SPENT AND I SPENT REVIEWS THE PLANS TO ENSURE THE HOSPITALS ARE REPORTING DATA CONSISTENTLY. HOWEVER HOSPITAL CHARGES VARY FROM REGION TO REGION SO THERE IS NO TRULY STANDARDIZED REQUIREMENT FOR CALCULATING AND RECORDING THE VALUE OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS. THIS MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR COMMUNITIES TO KNOW THE VALUE OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFITS BEING PROVIDED BY THE HOSPITAL IN EXCHANGE FOR ITS TAX EXEMPT STATUS. AB TWO OH FOUR REQUIRES ARE SPREAD TO DEVELOP REGULATIONS STANDARDIZING THE CALCULATION AND REPORTING OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS. TO REPORT THE AMOUNT EACH HOSPITAL SINCE THE SPENDS ON COMMUNITY BENEFITS. AND AUTHORIZES ARE SPREAD TO FIND HOSPITALS IT FAILED TO FILE THEIR COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLANS. THE BILL REQUIRES HOSPITALS TO REPORT THE KEY TO THEIR COMMUNITY RATHER THAN US A HOSPITAL SYSTEM. IS THERE COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLANS ON THEIR WEBSITE. AND APPLY COMMUNITY BENEFIT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS TO ALL HOSPITALS THAT ARE A PART OF THE SYSTEM INCLUDING SMALL AND RURAL HOSPITALS. THIS BILL IS INTENDED TO ASSURE THAT AS A HOSPITAL SYSTEM MAY GROW IN SIZE THE INDIVIDUAL HOSPITALS IN THE SYSTEM REMAIN MEANINGFUL COMMUNITY PARTNERS. I'M WORKING WITH CH A TO ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS THE ANALYSIS DESCRIBES AMENDMENTS WELL TAKEN APPROPRIATIONS TO ADDRESS A PORTION OF THOSE CONCERNS. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE I HAVE TWO WITNESSES WITH ME HERE MOVE THE BILL THANK YOU.

WHAT COMMUNITY BENEFITS MAY BE EXPRESSIONS OF THE HOSPITAL'S CHARITABLE MISSIONS AND GOAL IT IS ALSO USED AS JUSTIFICATION FOR THE HOSPITALS NOW -- TAX EXEMPT STATUS. AB TOOL FOR ISN'T IMPORTANT MEASURED THAT INSURERS TAX EXEMPT PRIVATE NONPROFIT HOSPITALS ARE PROVING THEIR WORTH. AND ARE ACTUALLY PROVIDING MEASURABLE COMMUNITY BENEFITS TO THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES THAT THEY SERVE.

THROUGH PREMIUMS AND COST SHARING FOR THESE REASONS WE SUPPORT THE BILL AND WE REQUEST ARRIVAL THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MARK WINDOWS WITH US HERE YOU CALIFORNIA.

TWO TWO I'M SORRY STIRS TWELVE POLITICAL LEAVE IT OPEN AND THEN ON YOUR NEXT BILL GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD AFTERNOON MAYOR MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. AB. TWO NINETY THE PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU IS NOT A NEW. ONE AB TWO NINETY IS SIMILAR TO SB ELEVEN FIFTY SIX OF LAST YEAR CARRIED BY SENATOR LEYVA. SENATOR LABORS BILL MADE IT TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK BUT WAS VETOED. IN MY BILL I'VE INCLUDED LANGUAGE TO ADDRESS THE VERY CONCERNS EXPRESSED BY THEN GOVERNOR BROWN. HEALTHCARE PREMIUMS ARE ALREADY TOO EXPENSIVE FOR MANY PEOPLE AND WHEN GIMMICKS BY PROVIDERS ARE USED TO ENSURE THAT REIMBURSEMENT RATES ARE HIGHER THAN THEY SHOULD BE. IT'S TIME TO DO SOMETHING. THIS BILL WILL PREVENT PROVIDERS FROM GAMING THE SYSTEM AS A MECHANISM TO ARTIFICIALLY GENERATES THREE TO FOUR TIMES THE MEDICARE RATE FOR PROVIDING THE EXACT SAME CARE. WELL YOU PROBABLY HEARD ARGUMENTS AND HE EVEN ADDS A% SCARE PATIENTS ABOUT HOW THE SYSTEM OF CARE WILL COLLAPSE OR CLINICS WILL CLOSE. THE COMMERCIAL MARKET MOVES TO A MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT LEVEL. I CAN TELL YOU THAT OF A LOOK AT THIS CAREFULLY AND I QUESTIONED IT. I REMAIN UNCONVINCED THAT THE LIMITED NUMBER OF PATIENTS RECEIVING ASSISTANCE UNDER THIS PROGRAM WILL FUNDAMENTALLY DISRUPT THE CARE THAT PATIENTS RECEIVE. THE GAMING OF THE SYSTEM IS HARMFUL IN MANY WAYS BUT OUR PRIMARY CONCERN IS HOW IT DRIVES UP THE COST FOR EVERYONE BY SHIFTING RISK TO A FRAGILE AND COSTLY INDIVIDUAL MARKET. HEALTHCARE PREMIUMS IN THE COMMERCIAL MARKET ARE INCREASINGLY COSTLY AND THAT MUST CHANGE THAT'S WHY AUTHORED A A. B. TWO TO NINETY AS WELL AS MY OTHER BILL AB ONE SEVENTY FOUR WHICH PROPOSES SUBSIDIES TO PROVIDE. A BROADER NUMBER OF PEOPLE TO MAKE -- PROVIDED SUBSIDIES TO A BROADER NUMBER OF PEOPLE TO MAKE ACA COVERAGE MORE AFFORDABLE. THIS BILL IS ABOUT HELPING ABOUT MAKING THE HEALTHCARE MARKET WORK WITHOUT UNDUE DISTORTIONS DRIVEN STRICTLY BY PROFIT MOTIVATED COMPANIES. WHY YOU MAY HAVE HEARD ARGUMENTS IS THIS ISN'T ABOUT PART IT'S IT IS NOT? THEIR PROFITS ARE ALREADY HIGHLY REGULATED AND THIS BILL SIMPLY LIMITS REIMBURSEMENT FOR ONE ASPECT OF COVERAGE. IT DOESN'T RELIEVE INSURANCE COMPANIES OF THEIR RESPONSIBILITY TO COST -- TO COVER COSTLY DRUG MATT REGIMENS OR OTHER RELATED TREATMENT. AB TWO NINETY PROTECT LEGITIMATE THIRD PARTY PAYMENT MECHANISMS. REMOVES THE INCENTIVE PROVIDERS TO GAME THE SYSTEM AND ESTABLISH THE SAFEGUARDS TO WHOLE PATIENTS WHO MAY HAVE INADVERTENTLY BEEN CAUGHT UP IN ONE OF THESE PAYMENT SCHEMES HARMLESS. THE BILL DOES NOT PRECLUDE ANY ENTITY FROM CONTRIBUTING TO A CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION FOR THE PURPOSE OF HELPING A PATIENT TO PAY FOR THEIR CARE WERE THERE COVERAGE. IT ONLY PREVENTS THE ENTITY FROM INCREASING THEIR PROFITS BY MAKING THOSE CONTRIBUTIONS. WHETHER THEY CONTINUE TO MAKE THESE CONTRIBUTIONS MAYBE THE REAL INDICATION OF WHETHER THE CONTRIBUTIONS ARE ABOUT PATIENTS. OR ABOUT PROFITS. HERE IN SUPPORT WITH ME TODAY STEPHANIE WATKINS OF THE ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA LIFE AND INSURANCE COMPANIES. AND SERRA FLOCKS WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS THEIR FLOCKS CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION -- OUR AFFILIATES NEGOTIATE FOR AND PURCHASE HEALTH BENEFITS ON BEHALF OF TWO MILLION UNIVERSE IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE ARE FEELING THE IMPACTS OF THE SCHEME THAT DOCTOR WOULD DESCRIBED -- WHICH IS UNNECESSARY THERE'S A FEW PROVIDERS IN THE STATE THAT ARE EXPLOITING THE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS IN THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. TO CHARGE HIGHER REIMBURSEMENT RATE FEELING IT -- IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THERE WAS A LEADING DIALYSIS COMPANY THAT HAD A DISCLOSURE THAT FOUR THOUSAND OF THEIR PATIENTS WE'RE GETTING CHARITABLE PREMIUM MAKE -- ASSISTANCE FROM THE A. K. F. TO COVER THEIR GROUP COVERAGE THEIR COBRA OR THE THE PLAN THAT THEIR EMPLOYER PROVIDE IT. THAT MEANS THAT THERE ARE FOUR THOUSAND PATIENTS WHOSE EMPLOYERS ARE PAYING AN ARTIFICIALLY INFLATED RATE FOR THEIR DIALYSIS CARE. THAT MEANS THERE ARE FOUR THOUSAND WORKERS WHO ARE ALSO HAVING TO COVER THE COST OF THAT CARE UNNECESSARILY. WHEN THAT GETS BUILT INTO THEIR PREMIUMS THIS IS SOMETHING THAT DRIVES UP THE COST OF CARE IT TAKES MONEY OUT OF THE POCKETS OF WORKERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND IS UNNECESSARY? AB TWO NINETY IS A BILL THAT WE CAN USE THAT WILL PROTECT PATIENTS AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY GET THE CARE THEY NEED. BUT A LIMóN EIGHT WHAT IS BASICALLY WASTE IN THE SYSTEM. AND SO WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT THOSE FOUR THOUSAND PATIENTS ARE STILL GETTING THE CARE THEY NEED BUT THEY'RE NOT TAKING MONEY OUT OF THE POCKETS OF WORKERS AND EMPLOYERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND FOR THAT REASON WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. ANY WALK INS ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES FIRST WE'D LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR TAKING ON THIS REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE. AND FOR THE MEMBERS AND ALL THE TIME THAT WE SPENT WITH A LOT OF YOU TRYING TO EXPLAIN -- WHAT THIS DOES TO THE SYSTEM AND HOW IT REALLY HARMS PREMIUM PAYERS AND I'D I'D FIRST LIKE TO START UP WITH SAYING THAT AND NO WAY -- IS THIS BILL INTENDED TO DISPARAGE THE GOOD WORKS OF NON PROFITS I THINK WE ALL SEE A ROLE FOR THEM TO PLAY IN IT CERTAINLY. ONE THAT WE SUPPORT UNFORTUNATELY WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS A SMALL SUBSET OF PROVIDERS. USING THE GUARANTEED ISSUE -- PROVISIONS THAT WERE ESTABLISHED IN THE A. C. THE SHIFT PEOPLE FROM OTHERWISE BE MEDICARE MEDICAID ELIGIBLE INTO COMMERCIAL ALLIANCE OF COVERAGE. AND WHAT THAT REALLY DOES IS IT NOT ONLY PUTS THAT PATIENT AT RISK IN SOME SENSES BECAUSE TO REALLY UNDERSTAND THAT IF YOU'RE ON A COMMERCIAL PLAN EVEN A PPO PLATINUM PLAN YOU MAY BE -- HAVE TO PAY OTHER COPAYS COINSURANCE MANY OF THESE PEOPLE ARE INCREDIBLY SICK THEY HAVE COMORBIDITIES THEY OFTEN END UP IN THE HOSPITAL WITH THAT COMES THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS OF EXTRA COSTS THAT THEY MAY NOT NECESSARILY UNDERSTAND OR EXPECT. I THINK THE OTHER THING IS IS THAT WE'VE TRIED REALLY HARD WITH THIS BILL TO THREAD A NEEDLE OF PROTECTING THOSE FORMAL PATIENTS AND ALLOWING THESE NONPROFIT. IF IF IT IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE PATIENT TO ACTUALLY PAY THEIR PREMIUMS BUT WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS MAKE SURE THAT THOSE DECISIONS ARE BEING MADE ON THE BEST INTEREST OF THE PATIENT AND NOT BASED ON THE BEST INTEREST OF THE PROVIDER. AND SO WE'VE WE'VE TRIED TO DO IS TAKE OUT THE FINANCIAL INCENTIVE OF THAT AND LIKE DOCTOR WOULD MENTIONED WE ALSO PUT IN PROVISIONS TO ENSURE THAT THIS IS NO WAY TO DO UNDER WRITING THIS IS IN A WAY TO SHIFT PEOPLE OFF OF OUR ROLES. THIS IS SIMPLY A WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE BEING SUPPORTED WHO ARE BEING SPONSORED TRULY UNDERSTAND THE RAMIFICATIONS OF THE PRODUCT THEY'RE ON THEY THEY ARE COVERED FOR A FULL TWELVE MONTHS OF THE PLAN YEAR. THAT THE PLANS ARE NOTIFIED WHEN THIS HAPPENS WHEN THERE IS A THIRD OF FINANCIALLY INTERESTED THIRD PARTY PAYER. AND ALSO LASTLY THAT WE DO YOU ADDRESS THE REIMBURSEMENT RATE TO ENSURE THAT. THOSE WHO WERE WHO WERE ADVISING CONSULTING AND HELPING THESE PATIENTS ARE DOING IT OUT OF THE BEST INTEREST OF THE PATIENT AND NOT BECAUSE THERE'S A FINANCIAL INTEREST TO THEM. AND A PERFECT EXAMPLE AS MANY OF YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR IS HIGHLIGHTED THAT. BECAUSE THEY ARE COMMISSION BASE BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY WERE ADVISING PEOPLE IN THE BEST INTEREST IF SOMEONE WAS OTHERWISE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDIC HOW THAT CHOSE TO BE IN A COMMERCIAL PLAN. THAT AGENT OR BROKER DIDN'T RECEIVE A COMMISSION BASED ON THAT TO ENSURE THAT THEY WERE REALLY ADVISING PEOPLE BASED ON THEIR OWN PERSONAL AND BEST INTERESTS. AND REALLY WE'VE TRIED REALLY HARD TO WORK WITH OUR PARTNERS AND WITH THE WITH THE DOCTOR WOULD TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS BILL STRIKE THAT BALANCE AND PROTECTS WONDERFUL PATIENTS WHILE ALSO. ENSURING THE INTEGRITY OF THE SYSTEM GOING FORWARD. THANK YOU THINK WE GOT ABOUT A MILLION HALF LEFT.

MISTER CHAIR WILL HAVE THREE WITNESSES THE DAY BUT WE WILL STAY WITHIN THE SIX MINUTES HAVE A GREAT MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME'S MICHAEL ARNOLD I'M HERE TO TESTIFY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DIALYSIS COUNCIL IN OPPOSITION TO AB. TWO NINETY I WOULD FIRST LIKE TO SAY HOW MUCH RESPECT WE HAVE FOR CHAIRMAN WOULD. HE HAS BEEN VERY HELPFUL TO THE DIALYSIS COMMUNITY ON MANY PAST OCCASIONS -- AND WE WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT FACT. HOWEVER. WE FEAR THAT THERE WILL BE MANY UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. ARISING FOR PATIENTS FROM THE ENACTMENT OF AB. TWO NINETY ON BEHALF OF OF BOTH. NOT FOR PROFIT AND FOR PROFIT DIALYSIS PROVIDERS THAT OPERATES SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY CLINICS IN CALIFORNIA. AND SEE SEVENTY THOUSAND PATIENTS WE ARE STRONGLY OPPOSED TO AB. TWO NINETY I WILL SUMMARIZE OUR OUR OBJECTIONS AND WE'LL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. FIRST AND FOREMOST AB TWO NINETY COULD JEOPARDIZE. THE VARIABILITY. OF VULNERABLE LOW INCOME PATIENTS TO RECEIVE TERRIBLE PREMIUM ASSISTANCE. ACCORDING TO THE LETTER FILED WITH THE COMMITTEE. BY THE AMERICAN KIDNEY FUND AND I QUOTE IF AB TWO NINETY IS PASSED IT WILL QUICKLY FORCE IT QUE OF TO STOP HELPING LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS LIVING WITH KIDNEY FAILURE. ACCORDING TO THE A. K. F. A. B. TWO NINETY WOULD PUT THE A. K. F. OUT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL GUIDANCE. RATHER THAN RISK THE ENTIRE NATION WIDE PATIENT BASE THAT THEY SERVE. THEY WERE CLEAR THAT THEY'D LIKELY STOP PROVIDING ASSISTANCE IN CALIFORNIA. THAT MEANS AB TWO NIGHT IMMEDIATELY PUTS AT RISK PREMIUM ASSISTANCE FOR NINETY FOUR THOUSAND PATIENTS THE MAJORITY OF THESE PATIENTS ARE MINORITY. AND ALMOST ALL OF THEM ARE LOW INCOME. AB TWO NINETY AS A GIFT TO THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY. WITH NO REQUIREMENTS THAT INSURERS PASS ON ANY OF THE SAVINGS. IT ALLOWS INSURERS TO ME THE MEDICARE RATE. FOR PATIENTS ON JOURNAL PREMIUM ASSISTANCE. WHICH IS BELOW THE COST OF CARE. AB TWO NINETY COULD JEOPARDIZE ACCESS FOR ALL PATIENTS. 90% OF THE PATIENTS. ON DIALYSIS. HAVE INSURANCE FUNDED BY THE GOVERNMENT THAT DOES NOT PAY THE COST OF CARE. IF WE START REDUCING PAYMENTS FOR A PORTION OF THE REMAINING IT DISRUPTS THE ENTIRE ECO SYSTEM JEOPARDIZING THE FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF CLINICS. WELL PROVIDERS WOULD WORK HARD TO PREVENT CLINIC CLOSURES AND CUTBACKS. DIALYSIS PROVIDERS ARE ALREADY SLOWING FUTURE EXPANSION PLANS IN CALIFORNIA DUE TO THE CONSTANT ATTACK BY INSURERS AND OTHER SPECIAL INTERESTS. IT TAKES ABOUT FIVE YEARS. FROM THE IDEA TO GET A DIALYSIS CLINIC ON LINE AND OPERATING. THE DEMAND FOR DIALYSIS IS GROWING IN CALIFORNIA AT 5% PER YEAR OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS. WE WILL NEED AN ADDITIONAL THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY DIALYSIS CLINICS. IF AB TWO AND IDEAS PASSED PATIENTS IN THE FUTURE WILL HAVE A HARDER TIME GETTING CONVENIENT ACCESS TO THE TREATMENT THEY NEED. THREE DAYS A WEEK FOUR HOURS OF TIME. FOR THESE AND OTHER REASONS WE STRONGLY OPPOSE THE BILL. KELLY BEING HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING MORE THAN FORTY FOUR THOUSAND PHYSICIAN MEMBERS INCLUDING HUNDREDS OF MEDICAL DIRECTORS THAT OVERSEE PATIENT KEREN DIALYSIS CLINICS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. OUR MEMBERS HAVE EXPRESSED SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS WITH AB. TWO NINE ZERO AB TWO NINE ZERO IS FUNDAMENTALLY A RATE SETTING BILL FOR PRIVATE INSURANCE PAYMENTS TO PROVIDERS. IT SETS REIMBURSEMENTS THAT THE MEDICARE RATE WHICH MICHAEL MENTIONED THIS BLOW THE COST OF CARE. WE ARE CONCERNED THE BILL WILL CREATE LONG TERM ACCESS ISSUES FOR PATIENTS LIKE RENEE HERE. NEW CLINIC GROWTH HAS ALREADY SLOWED BY AS MUCH AS ONE THIRD DEPENDING ON THE PROVIDER. WITHOUT RELIABLE ACCESS TO LIFE SAVING TREATMENT DIALYSIS PATIENTS WILL END UP IN IMPACT OF HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOMS LIKELY WITH ADDITIONAL HEALTH COMPLICATIONS. THIS WILL BE A MUCH HIGHER COST TO THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM THAN THE SAVINGS THIS BILL REALIZE FOR EVERYONE. FOR THESE REASONS CMA'S IN OPPOSITION TO AB TWO NINE ZERO THANK YOU. THE WE GOT JUST ABOUT TWO MINUTES GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS RENEE BLUE I CAME HERE TODAY FROM AUBURN. I AM A DAYLIGHT DIALYSIS PATIENT AND I GET HELP FROM THE AMERICAN KIDNEY FUND I URGE YOU TO VOTE NO ON AB. TWO NINETY I CRASHED INTO DIALYSIS IN JULY.

I HOPE TO EVENTUALLY GO BACK TO WORK BUT AS OF NOW I AM UNABLE TO DO SO. I WAS AN HR DIRECTOR OF MY EMPLOYER. TO AND THE PHYSICAL MENTAL EMOTIONAL CHALLENGES THAT COME WITH DIALYSIS TREATMENTS BUT THEY HAD TO LET ME GO BECAUSE I COULD ONLY WORK TWO DAYS A WEEK. AND THEY NEEDED SOMEBODY FULL TIME I WAS ON COBRA BUT IT RAN OUT. I NEED TO CONTINUE WITH MY CURRENT HEALTH PLAN BECAUSE I WANTED TO KEEP THE SPECIALISTS. WHO ARE TREATING A BLOOD DISEASE THAT I HAVE I WAS ALSO EXPOSED TO HEPATITIS C.? I HAVE FIVE OTHER DOCTORS BESIDES MY NOW FOR ALL AGES AND EVERY WEEK I HAVE ONE OR TWO DOCTORS APPOINTMENTS. IN ADDITION TO MY THREE TIMES A WEEK DIALYSIS TREATMENTS. WITH CHARITABLE PREMIUM ASSISTANCE I AM ABLE TO KEEP MY INSURANCE AND MY PREMIUM IS PAID. FOR THE BEST THING IS PEACE OF MIND KNOWING I CAN KEEP MY HEALTH COVERAGE. AND THE DOCTORS WHO ARE TREATING MY OTHER HEALTH ISSUES. WITHOUT THE AMERICAN KIDNEY FUND I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WOULD HAVE DONE. I AM NOW ABLE TO PAY MY BILLS AND HOUSING. I READ THE LETTER FROM THE AMERICAN KIDNEY FUND OPPOSING THIS BILL THEY SAID IF THIS PASSES THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO OPERATE IN CALIFORNIA. HERE'S A QUOTE FROM THEIR LETTER IF IN LOW INCOME DIALYSIS AND TRANSPLANT PATIENTS IN CALIFORNIA NO MATTER WHAT KIND OF INSURANCE THEY HAVE. MEDICARE OR PRIVATE THAT SCARES ME. AND I'M SURE IT WILL SCARE OTHERS WHEN THEY HEAR THIS THE WAY I SEE IT. AB TWO NINETY HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES BUT HURTS PATIENTS LIKE ME. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY INSURANCE COMPANY PROFITS ARE MORE IMPORTANT TO THE WELL. THEN THE WELFARE OF DIALYSIS PATIENTS. PLEASE VOTE NO ON AB.

I'M ALSO A PATIENT OF A PASS KIDNEY PATIENT AND I OPPOSE AB TWO NINETY THANK YOU THANK YOU. HELLO MY NAME IS ANGELO WAIT MEN I'M A DIALYSIS CARE GIVER FOR TWENTY SIX YEARS CURRENTLY WORKING FOR FOR SENIORS WOODLAND AND I OPPOSE AB TWO NINETY THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MICHAEL LONG. SACRAMENTO FOURTEEN YEARS PATIENT CARE TECHNICIAN AYE OPPOSED. TO NINETY JORDAN GROSSMAN VENTURA COUNTY I STRONGLY OPPOSE. CHRISTY CAPRI FROM WHAT I CALIFORNIA -- PATIENT CARE TECHNICIAN FOR OVER NINETEEN YEARS AND I OPPOSE. KERRY GREEN FROM SACRAMENTO CALIFORNIA AND I OPPOSE AB. TWO NINETY GREAT ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SAYING NOW WILL COME BACK ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS YES I AGREE -- THANK YOU DOCTOR WOULD -- BRING THIS FORWARD IN SHINING A LIGHT ON IT THAT I HADN'T THOUGHT ABOUT BEFORE BUT SO HOW MUCH MONEY WE'RE TALKING HERE. I'M HONESTLY NOT QUITE SURE -- I THINK THAT -- THIS IS AN INDUSTRY THAT MAKES BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A LIMITED NUMBER OF PATIENTS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. SEVENTY THOUSAND PATIENTS GET TREATMENT FOUR THOUSAND GET SOME ASSISTANCE THROUGH THE AMERICAN KIDNEY FINE FOR THE YEAH A CALF -- HALF OF THOSE -- HELPING WITH THEIR MEDICARE -- MEDICARE ADVANTAGE -- THOSE KINDS OF THINGS THE OTHER HALF GET THE THE PREMIUM ASSISTANCE SO IN ESSENCE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TWO THOUSAND TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE HERE -- WHICH HOW MUCH MONEY IS GOING TO SAVE DO WE HAVE ANY IDEA. SHE SHE MIGHT THANK YOU I DON'T HAVE IT SORRY I KNOW IT'S A GOOD -- IN THE MOST RECENT QUARTERLY ANALYST CALL DIVVIED UP WHICH REPRESENTS HALF OF THE MARKET HERE IN CALIFORNIA FOR DIALYSIS CLINICS. INFORM SHAREHOLDERS THAT THE IMPACT OF AB TWO NINETY SPECIFICALLY WOULD BE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TWENTY FIVE AND FORTY MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. IN PROFIT FOR DA VIDA SO EXTRAPOLATING THAT OUT IF THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY WERE TO PARTICIPATE. IN AN EQUAL AMOUNT THAT WOULD BE A HIGH END OF EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS IN DIALYSIS INDUSTRY PROFIT. BY COMPARISON THE DIALYSIS INDUSTRY MADE MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN PROFIT IN CALIFORNIA. IN. TWENTY SEVENTEEN A ON THE SAVINGS TO THE ENTIRE MARKET GO WELL BEYOND THAT EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS. BECAUSE THERE ARE THE OTHER LOSSES FOR ODD THAT INSURANCE PLANS. EXPERIENCE WHEN THESE PATIENTS GO TO HOSPITALS AND OTHER PROVIDERS AS WELL AS THE DIALYSIS INDUSTRY IS NOT THE ONLY GROUP PARTICIPATING IN THIS. WE SEE THIS PRACTICE IN SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER CLINICS AS WELL FOR THEIR FAN VERY HIGH LOSSES EXPERIENCED BY PLANS. SO WILL THE PATIENT SEES SAVINGS RATE PAYERS WITH REPAIRS EXCUSE ME THE REPAIR SEE A SAVINGS. THAT WOULD YES GIVEN THE MEDICAL LOSS RATIO REQUIREMENTS. HERE IN IN BOTH NATIONALLY AND HERE IN CALIFORNIA. A SAVINGS EXPERIENCED BY PLANS WOULD THEN BE. CONSIDERED LOWER CLAIMS BY -- BY PLANTS AND WITHOUT STEPHANIE GO FURTHER. CALIFORNIA ADOPTED VERY ROBUST RATE REVIEW AND AM ALL OUR REQUIREMENTS WE ALSO DO DISCLOSURES SPA AND LARGE GROUP FILINGS SO WITH THOSE YOU WOULD SEE. IF YOU SAW DIRECTORS OLD AND REDUCTION OF CLAIMS THAT WOULD BE COOL THEN TO WITHIN OUR RATE REVIEW PROCESS THE REGULATOR WOULD LOOK AT THAT WOULD REDUCE WE BELIEVE PREMIUMS TO BOTH RATE PAYERS AND CONSUMERS. AND THEN YOU WOULD ALSO SEE -- AS A PART OF THAT I THINK ONE OF MY PLANS HAS IDENTIFIED THIS AS POTENTIALLY A 1% INCREASE IN PREMIUMS. I ALSO HAVE ANOTHER PLAN SIMILAR TO THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE THAT -- WE USE AN EXAMPLE AS OF ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OF UNDER WRITTEN PREMIUM THAT WAS THE TOTAL THAT THEY COLLECTED TO TO COVER FROM MATERNITY. TO CANCER TREATMENT TO PREVENT IT IS FACE IN A SINGLE YEAR. SO WITH THAT KIND OF GIVES YOU THE REASON WHY THIS IS SUCH A HUGE IMPACT TO THE SYSTEM AND TO RATE PAYERS. I THINK OUR GOAL ALL HERE'S WERE VERY PRICE SENSITIVE AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT TO THE DEGREE WE CAN IDENTIFY AREAS WHERE THERE IS MANIPULATION OF THE SYSTEM -- WE WANT TO BRING IT TO FOCUS ATTENTION AND MAKE SURE THAT WE ADDRESS THAT BECAUSE THEY'RE REAL PEOPLE IN YOUR DISTRICTS. THAT ARE TRYING TO PAY FOR HEALTH INSURANCE AND ARE STRUGGLING AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE THOUGHTFUL AND SENSITIVE TO THAT. HELLO QUITE SENSITIVE TO THIS BECAUSE WE RURAL AREAS THE LAST THING I WANT TO SEE IS AXIS -- DIMINISHED I'VE BEEN TOLD PRETTY CLEARLY THAT TAXES WOULDN'T BE DIMINISHED. AND SO I'M SITTING HERE WONDERING YOU KNOW THIS COST SHIFT WHERE WARY REALLY GOING WITH THIS I MEAN WHO IS IT REALLY GOING TO BENEFIT -- IT REALLY AT THE LOWER RATES ARE WE GOING TO MAKE SURE BENEFIT OUR RURAL COMMUNITIES -- THERE'S SO MANY QUESTIONS STILL HERE BECAUSE I DO FEEL LIKE WE'RE KIND OF GOING. WAS A GAME WE HIT THE BALL IT OVER HERE. AND SO -- I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE RE HAVE ARE PEOPLE TAKING CARE OF AND THE CONUNDRUM FOR ME RIGHT NOW. ASSEMBLY MEMBER I CAN COMMENT ON THAT IF YOU WOULD LIKE ME -- TO ONE OF ONE OF THE MAJOR DRIVING. FACTORS THAT CREATES THIS PROBLEM IS THE FINANCING FOR DIALYSIS IN THIS COUNTRY. THE MEDICARE SYSTEM REIMBURSES AT A RATE THAT IS LESS THAN. THE COST OF THE DIALYSIS TREATMENT. FOR THOSE PATIENTS WHO ARE MEDI CAL ONLY AND IN PARTICULAR -- THE THE UNDOCUMENTED PATIENTS WHO ARE ON EMERGENCY MEDICAL. THAT REIMBURSEMENT RATE IS ONLY ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE OR A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS PER TREATMENT THE MEDICARE RATE IS TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS PER. PER TREATMENT AVERAGE. SO YOU CAN SEE THAT IF WE HAVE A MEDI CAL PATIENTS. THREE TIMES A WEEK WE'RE LOSING SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF DOLLARS TO TREAT THAT PATIENT AND SO. ONE OR TWO PATIENTS IN A DIALYSIS CLINIC TO TAKE USUALLY IN THE RURAL AREAS OR IN THE URBAN CORE WELL WE HAVE A LOT OF UNINSURED PATIENTS A LOT OF MEDI CAL PATIENTS. CAN MAKE THE DIFFERENCE. AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THAT CLINIC. HE CAN REMAIN OPEN -- OR WILL NOT REMAIN OPEN OR LET'S LET'S SAY THEY HAVE REVENUES IN EXCESS OF THEIR EXPENSES. UNDER THE CURRENT STRUCTURE. OUR COMPANIES THE NOT FOR PROFIT COMPANIES AND THE FOR PROFIT COMPANIES CAN USE SOME OF THE MONEY THAT THEY MAKE IN OTHER AREAS OF THE STATE. TO SUPPORT THE IN THE CLINICS IN YOUR DISTRICT FRANKLY. UP UNDER THIS BILL THEY WOULD LOSE THOSE. PATIENTS THAT -- BEING REIMBURSED AT THE PRIVATE SECTOR RATES. WHICH I THOUGHT I MUST ALSO SAY ME YOUR BUSINESS PLAN I'M JUST YEAH I WAS QUESTION NOT. NONE OF THAT'S FINE YOUR BUSINESS PLAN PIE TAKES IT INTO CONSIDERATION DOESN'T IT I MEAN YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE SO MANY THAT ARE GOING TO BE MAYBE UNDOCUMENTED SOME YOU CAN BE MEDICARE I MEAN. THERE'S A FORMULA THAT YOU. THERE IS AN EXISTING STRUCTURE. THAT THAT THIS BILL WOULD TEAR APART. CAN WE CHANGE INSTRUCTION. WELL WE CAN WE CAN INCREASE REIMBURSEMENT RATES UNDER THE MEDI CAL PROGRAM THAT WOULD BE ONE IMPORTANT FIRST STEP -- TO TAKE AND IT. YOU KNOW IT'S A SERIOUS PROBLEM WE THOUGHT A WHOLE LOT ABOUT. THIS YEAR'S BILL AND AND WE DON'T WANT TO OPPOSE THE CHAIRS BILL BUT WE SEEM WE FEEL THAT WE JUST HAVE NO CHOICE BASED ON THE PATIENTS AND THE REAL ISSUE IS THAT. WE'RE CREATING I MEAN BASED UPON ALL OF THE DIFFICULTIES WE'VE HAD OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS. THE DIALYSIS PROVIDERS. OR LOOKING AT BUILDING FACILITIES NOT IN CALIFORNIA ANYMORE BUT THEY'RE BUILDING THEM IN. OTHER STATES -- AND SO WE REALLY I MEAN I THINK OR OR ARE -- PROVIDERS ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO KEEP CLINICS OPEN I DON'T I DON'T SEE ANY ANY CLINICS THAT ARE GONNA CLOSE AUTOMATICALLY BUT YOU KNOW YOU NEVER KNOW I CAN NEVER I CAN ASSURE THAT. BUT WE THINK THEY CAN KEEP THEM OPEN HOWEVER. WE'RE GOING TO CREATE A TICKING TIME BOMB WHERE. COMPANIES ARE NOT GOING TO SPEND DOLLARS IN CALIFORNIA SO FIVE SIX SEVEN YEARS FROM NOW. WHEN WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS? FOR ALL OF THE DIALYSIS PATIENTS AND BY THE WAY OUR POPULATION CALIFORNIA IS A MISTRIAL IN A YEAR I THINK YOU'VE ANSWERED MISS AYE GARCIA CURRY'S QUESTION GIVE ANOTHER QUESTION. DID YOU WANT TO ANSWER AYE AYE YEAH I'D LIKE I'D LIKE TO DRESS I'D LIKE TO DRESS UP ON ON A COUPLE OF LEVELS FIRST OF ALL. I THINK WE'VE HEARD THAT THE PROFIT FOR DIALYSIS COMPANIES IN CALIFORNIA'S ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. IF WE USE THE THE NUMBERS THAT WE HER PROFIT OF FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN CALIFORNIA ALONE. SO I DON'T SEE HOW THAT. STILL PROFITABLE FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS LEADS TO THE CLOSURE OF OF CLINICS I DON'T AYE AYE THAT NO ONE HAS REALLY EXPLAIN THAT TO ME. AS FAR AS THE EXPANSION PLANS -- FOR THE FUTURE CMS IN IN WASHINGTON IS LOOKING AT THE COST OF DIED OF DELIVERING DIALYSIS CARE IS ACTUALLY LOOKING AT OTHER WAYS OF PROVIDING CARE TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE END STAGE RENAL DISEASE. THAT MAY NOT INVOLVE -- DIALYSIS AND ALSO I BELIEVE WE OUGHT TO BE REALLY FOCUSING ON HOW WE GET MORE PEOPLE TO TRANSPLANTS. KIDNEY TRANSPLANTS MAKING SURE THEY KNOW THEIR OPTIONS UP FRONT EARLY ON BECAUSE TRANSPLANTS. SAVE LIVES. YOU CAN EVEN YOU HAVE TO YOU COULD GET OUT MUCH HEALTHIER LIFE FOR FOR TEN OR MORE YEARS -- FROM A KIDNEY TRANSPLANT AT A READ AT A STATE A SIMILAR COST OR EVEN LESS THAN WHAT WE WENT WITH THE WITH DIALYSIS AND THAT PERSON WOULD NOT HAVE. TO HAVE TO BE HAVE TREATMENT THREE TIMES A WEEK SO SO THERE ARE OTHER THINGS AT PLAY HERE AND SO AS FAR AS THE FUTURE EXPANSION PLANS SOME OF THAT I BELIEVE IS BEING DRIVEN BY THE FACT THAT CMS IS LOOKING. AT ALTERNATIVE WAYS OF DOING TREATMENT -- IN HONG KONG FOR EXAMPLE 70% OF THE PEOPLE WHO RECEIVE DIALYSIS RECEIVE IT AT HOME. NOT IN A CLINIC AND THERE ARE MANY OTHER EXAMPLES OF WAYS THE WAY THE TREATMENT OF END STAGE RENAL DISEASE IS CHANGING AND AND IN THE UNITED STATES AND ACROSS THE AND THAT'S AND THAT SO I BELIEVE THAT HAS A HAS A FACTOR OF WHY THESE ARE. THESE THESE PLANS THESE EXPANSION PLANS MAY BE SLOWING DOWN. AS WELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH REALLY GOOD TO SOME MEMBER -- CARILLO AND THEN TO SOME OF OUR WORK. FORGET IT TURNED THE SUN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU -- I HAVE TWENTY NINE PEOPLE IN MY DISTRICT -- RECEIVE HERBAL PREMIUM ASSISTANCE FOR THEIR DIALYSIS TREATMENT WHO EXPRESSED CONCERN FOR LAST YEAR'S BILL BUT HOPE FOR A RESOLUTION -- THE BILL PREVIOUS BILL WENT PASSED BOTH HOUSES THE CAPITAL BY THE GOVERNOR. TO BE QUITE FRANK SOME ARE QUITE HAPPY ABOUT THAT -- SO MY COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS TO DATE ARE WITH THEM IN MIND AS WELL AS THE HEALTH NEEDS OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES UNDOCUMENTED COMMUNITIES LOW INCOME. PEOPLE OF COLOR WHO GENERALLY LACK ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. AND IN GRATITUDE TOWARDS THE WORKERS THAT ARE HERE TODAY TO PROVIDE THE SERVICE AND THANK YOU TO THE WITNESS I DID I'M SORRY I DIDN'T CATCH YOUR NAME. FOR COMING AND TESTIFYING. RENEE THANK YOU MY AUNT -- RECEIVES DIALYSIS AND I KNOW HOW TIRED SHE IS AFTER RECEIVING HER TREATMENT. SO -- I WANT TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF A PROFIT. SO IF DIALYSIS CLINICS CLAIM THAT 10% OF THEIR PATIENTS COVERED BY COMMERCIAL HEALTH PLANS EFFECTIVELY SUBSIDIZE. THE REMAINING 90% BY MEDICARE HOW WILL CAPPING THE REIMBURSEMENT RATES AT A LOWER COST AND THE SERVICES RENDERED ARE WORTH OR BENEFIT CONSUMERS IN GENERAL THAT'S ONE ADDITIONALLY. UNDER THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATIONS MOST RECENT TAX REFUNDS HEALTH CARE SERVICES CORPORATION WHICH IS THE PARENT COMPANY TO BLUESHIELD RECEIVED A ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR TAX REFUND. I'M WONDERING IF WE CAN GET SOME CLARITY. AS TO WHAT IS THE PATHWAY THAT ENSURES THAT THE PROFITS EARNED BY HEALTH PLANS ARE ACTUALLY BEING IMPLEMENTED AND BEING BROUGHT BACK TO CONSUMERS -- YEAH GREAT QUESTION RIGHT AND YOU KNOW WITH. I GO BACK TO TOO LONG QUESTIONS ARE SO -- THE FIRST QUESTION IN TWENTY NINE PATIENTS -- TO HAVE OR GETTING SOME SOME COVERAGE FIRST OF ALL -- BACK UP A LITTLE BIT -- IN STAGE RENAL DISEASE IS THE ONE DISEASE THAT ASSURES THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE -- THAT THAT YOU COULD BE COVERED BY MEDICARE -- AT ANY AGE. AT ANY AGE FULL SCOPE MEDICARE SERVICES AT ANY AGE. THE SAFETY NET EXIST TO PROTECT PEOPLE JUST LIKE YOU'RE JUST LIKE YOUR YOUR CONSTITUENTS -- WHETHER IT'S MEDI CAL OR MEDICARE NOTHING IN THE BILL PROHIBITS -- THE AMERICAN KIDNEY FIND FROM CONTINUING TO CONTRIBUTE TO HELP PATIENTS -- THEY SAY THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BASED ON AN OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL DECISION THAT WAS MADE IN. NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN THAT IS AN ARGUMENT THAT DID NOT COME UP LAST YEAR AND WE JUST LEARNED OF THAT RECENTLY AND I STILL AM TO THIS DAY DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THAT TWENTY TWO YEAR OLD DECISION. AFFECTS THIS BILL BECAUSE AS FAR AS I KNOW THE AG IS NOT WEIGHED IN ON WHAT WE'RE DOING -- I AS FAR AS PROFITS FOR INSURANCE PLANS INSURANCE PLANS ARE HIGHLY REGULATED -- THEY HAVE A CAP ON THEIR PROFITS -- AND THE DIALYSIS INDUSTRY HAS A VERY HIGH PROFIT MARGIN IT'S ACTUALLY HIGHER THAN MANY MANY SECTORS OF THE OF THE HEALTH CARE SPACE RIGHT NOW. SO THEY ARE MAKING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS -- AND AND AND PARTICULAR INSTANCE. THEY'RE MAKING A CONTRIBUTION. TO THE AMERICAN CAN BE FUN FOR WHICH THEY'RE GETTING A TAX DEDUCTION. AND THEY'RE GETTING THROUGH THE AMERICAN CAN BE FUN. PAYING FOR INSURANCE PREMIUMS THAT REIMBURSE THEM AT THREE OR FOUR TIMES THE RATE FOR MEDI CAL SO THEY'RE GETTING TO KIND OF DOUBLE DIPPING [inaudible] MY OPINION. THANK YOU ARE MISSED BURKE. OKAY SO ON WHAT YOU JUST SAID SO. CAN THE FUN CAN STILL PAY WHATEVER THAT 20% THAT MEDICARE AND THE PHONE WILL STILL BE ABLE TO DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING THERE'S NOTHING PREVENTS THEM FROM DOING THAT I THINK SO I WON IT FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU BECAUSE YOU HAVE SPENT. SOME TIME WITH ME AND ADDRESSED A LOT OF MY CONCERNS BECAUSE I DO HAVE OVER HALF MY DISTRICT IS ON MEDI CAL. 60% OF MY DISTRICT IS AFRICAN AMERICAN AND WE SUFFER GREATLY I HAVE THREE TIMES THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER CREEL HAS -- IN HER DISTRICT ON THIS PROGRAM SO THE THOSE FOLKS BUT FOR ME AS I HAVE EXPRESSED TO YOU AND TO THE SUPPORTERS AND OPPOSITION -- LISTEN I I KNOW THERE IS SOME I HATE TO SAY THIS I KNOW THERE IS SOME DISDAIN FOR THE OWNERS OF SOME OF THESE CLINICS AND I DON'T ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT THAT -- AND I DO KNOW THAT THERE ARE BEEN ATTACKS ON SEVERAL LEVELS ON THE CLINICS I ACTUALLY DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT EITHER. WHAT I DO CARE VERY MUCH ABOUT IS I LIVE IN A DISTRICT WHERE PEOPLE ARE CHALLENGED AND AS THIS AS RENEE CAN TELL YOU CHECK IT'S ONE THING TO BE FISCALLY CHALLENGED IT'S ANOTHER THING TO DO THAT AND THEN DO YOUR DIALYSIS OVERNIGHT? A BECAUSE YOU CAN'T THAT'S THE ONLY TIME YOU'RE ABLE TO DO IT AND THAT'S AND RIGHT NOW MY FOLKS HAVE ACCESS TO CLINICS. SO I AM VERY VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE CONSISTENT ATTACKS ON THE DIALYSIS CLINICS BECAUSE MY FOLKS CAN'T GO SOMEWHERE ELSE THEY CAN'T TAKE THREE BUSES THEY LOSE THEIR JOB AND QUITE FRANKLY WITH THE TRANSPLANT THEY LOSE THEIR JOB. AND SO I JUST MY CONCERN AND IT'S MORE OF A STATEMENT THAN ANYTHING ELSE IS AS WE CONTINUE I I LOOK FORWARD TO ALTERNATIVE METHODS OF TREATING. END STAGE RENAL DISEASE I REALLY DO BUT UNTIL THAT TIME I JUST WANT TO BE VERY VERY CLEAR WITH EVERYBODY OF THE SUPPORTERS AND THE OPPOSITION THAT. FOR ME I WILL SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY BUT I AM I GO TO MY REAL CLINICS BECAUSE WE HAVE SO MANY AND BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE IN MY DISTRICT HAVE TO USE THEM. I GO REGULARLY DURING MY BREAK I GO TO TWO OR THREE AND I I WILL FIND IT VERY OFFENSIVE THE IF AT ANY POINT THAT I FIND I BELIEVE IN THE SHORT TERM THEY'RE KNOCKING CLOSE. BUT I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE LONG TERM AND I A WILL WATCH ALL OF THESE BILLS CAREFULLY THAT HAVE TO DO WITH EIGHT AND STAGE RENAL DISEASE BECAUSE MY DISTRICTS AWFUL SO BAD FROM IT -- IF I START TO SEE DISTRICTS SEE RENAL IF I SEARCH SEE SOME OF THESE PLACES BECAUSE OF MY DISTRICT I BELIEVE THAT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A VERY SERIOUS DIFFERENT CONVERSATION -- I APPRECIATE THE WORK YOU HAVE DONE SO FAR I APPRECIATE THE TIME YOU'VE SPENT TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION WITH ME AND I KNOW YOU KNOW I AM I AM VERY SERIOUS ABOUT THIS. BUT I STATE ABOUT THE SUPPORT OPPOSITION I JUST TRY I JUST WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT SOME PEOPLE LIKE RENE. WHO WHO REALLY THIS IS THE NEXT LEVEL OF SUFFERING TO WORK IN SOME OF THE CONDITIONS THEY WORK AND AND THEN TO HAVE TO GO? TO SIT FOR FOUR HOURS OR OVERNIGHT FOR IT'S EXHAUSTING. AND I JUST HOPE FOR THINKING ABOUT SOME OF THOSE FOLKS FAR BEFORE THE TIME WE'RE THINKING ABOUT WHETHER -- ANY OF THESE FACILITIES ARE PROFITABLE OR WHETHER YOU ARE PROFITABLE INSURANCE AGENCY. ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS AT ALL -- MISTER RAMOS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR STILL A COUPLE QUESTIONS ON ANALYSIS THAT -- CAME OUT FROM THE COMMITTEE ON ON ON HOW. ON PAGE FIVE THERE'S A A STATEMENT OF PURPOSE OF THE BILL. IT SAYS THAT -- MAY BE VERY PATIENTS AWAY FROM MEDICARE AND THAT STATEMENT MAY BE HAVE WE SOLIDIFIED OUR VALIDATED THAT STATEMENT AT ALL UGH. IT'S DIFFICULT IT'S DIFFICULT TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT'S HAPPENING IN CLINICS AND BUT WE N A SOMEBODY ELSE WANTS TO SPEAK TO THAT BUT THAT'S PARTIALLY JUST A TECHNICAL LANGUAGE THAT IN NOT ALL CASES IS ITS STEERING A PATIENT. OFF OF A GOVERNMENT PROGRAM OFTEN WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT IF A PATIENT IS STILL EMPLOYED ONE THEY START DIALYSIS. THEN SOMEONE FROM THE CLINIC WILL GO TO THAT PATIENT. AND SAY TO THEM YOU CAN APPLY FOR A GRANT FROM THE FROM THE AMERICAN KIDNEY FUND TO PAY YOUR PREMIUMS INSTEAD OF GOING ON TO A PUBLIC PROGRAM. AND SO IT'S IT'S HOLDING PATIENTS ON COMMERCIAL COVERAGE WHEN OTHERWISE THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN EL ELIGIBLE TO GO ON TO MEDICARE. AND AND SO THAT'S WHERE THE LINE GETS A LITTLE BIT BLURRED BUT WE HAVE DOCUMENTED CASES. WHERE PATIENTS WHO ARE CURRENTLY ENROLLED IN FULL SCOPE MEDIC HAL? WERE. ENROLLED IN COMMERCIAL COVERAGE -- WHILE THEY WERE STILL IT IN SO ADDING A FULL SCOPE COVERAGE PLAN ON TOP OF THEIR MEDI CAL. SO WE'VE SEEN BOTH HOLDING PATIENTS FROM GOING ON TO GOVERNMENT PLANS. AS WELL AS MOVING PATIENTS FROM A GOVERNMENT PLAN ON TO A COMMERCIAL PLAN. SO WITH THAT STATEMENT AS FAR AS MAY BE VERY PATIENT TO SAY IT'S NOT A 100% SO THERE IS SOME. SOME. WAY AS FAR AND PROFIT NUMBERS THAT WERE JUST QUOTED -- BY THE AUTHOR THEN IF THAT'S THE CASE OF SOME OF THOSE -- NUMBERS THAT WERE QUOTED WOULD BE FLUID ALSO BECAUSE IT'S NOT A IF I'M SEEING IT RIGHT. I THINK IT THE THE PROFIT NUMBER CERTAINLY THE THE PROFIT NUMBER THAT THE COMPANY REPORTS IS -- FOR THE STATE IS IS IS AVAILABLE TO THEIR SCHOOL THEIR SHAREHOLDERS. OUT THERE -- THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WOULD ACTUALLY POTENTIALLY BE SAVED HERE IS IS PART OF WHAT IS WE'RE NOT EXACTLY SURE OF BUT BECAUSE YOU'RE EXTRAPOLATING THE NUMBERS -- BASED ON WHAT WE'VE HEARD FROM ONE COMPANY TALK TO THEIR TALK TO THEIR SHAREHOLDERS SO SO IT IS A IT IS DIFFICULT TO GET EXACT PANEL ON THAT. BUT BUT IF THAT IS ONE OF THE MAJOR PLAYERS IN THE INDUSTRY AND THAT BEING THE CASE IT'S I THINK IT'S FAIRLY REASONABLE TO EXTRACT BUT YOU ALSO HAVE. NONPROFIT CLINICS THAT ARE PROVIDING SERVICES WELL SO I THINK BELIEVE THE TWO MAJOR -- COMMERCIAL -- PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES -- ARE -- SAID OF THE MARKET ROUGHLY SO. HI IF I MIGHT -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER. THE QUESTION OF STEERING HAS BEEN RAISED. THE DIALYSIS INDUSTRY IS ONE OF THE MOST HEAVILY REGULATED INDUSTRIES IN THE NATION. ERROR HERE ARE THE CONDITIONS FOR COVERAGE. THAT WERE ADOPTED AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL BY CMS. IN ORDER TO QUALIFY AS A MEDICARE PROVIDER AND 80% OF OUR PATIENTS ARE MEDICARE PATIENTS SO YOU HAVE TO BE A MEDICARE PROVIDER IN ORDER TO BE SUCCESSFUL. YOU HAVE TO COMPLY WITH THE CONDITIONS FOR COVERAGE THE CONDITIONS FOR COVERAGE HAVE MANY MANY -- PROVISIONS RELATING. TO MANDATES THAT YOU PROVIDE YOUR PATIENTS WITH INFORMATION ABOUT INSURANCE OPTIONS. BUT ALSO PROHIBITING ANY STEERING ACTIVITY BY THE DIALYSIS FACILITIES SO WE FLATLY REJECT THE IDEA THAT WE'RE STEERING PATIENTS AND AND IN PARTICULAR WE WOULD NEVER STEER PATIENT OFF OF A MEDICARE PROGRAM BECAUSE THE COST OF MONEY IF THEY EVER GET BACK ON IT'S IT'S ONE OF THE PROBLEMS. WE FACE IS A VERY COMPLICATED REGULATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS AND SO YOU SORT OF TO SORT THROUGH THE MALL BUT WHEN YOU TAKE WHEN YOU TAKE. WHEN YOU PULL THE PIECES STRING AND AND TAKE ALL THIS MONEY AWAY FROM PROVIDERS AND PUT IT IN THE HANDS OF THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY? YOU HAVE TO ASSUME THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME KIND OF ADVERSE AFFECT ON PATIENTS AND THAT'S OUR CONCERN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MORE QUESTIONS WAS ROSS YEAH I HAVE A RATHER MISTER CHAIR -- AND ALSO IN THE BACK OF MATERIAL IT TALKS ABOUT -- CMS AND AND A RULING -- THERE WAS MOVING FORWARD BUT THEN -- ENDED UP BEING -- CHALLENGED -- AND IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER CMX WILL MOVE FOR WITH THIS RULE IS THERE AN UPDATE ON THAT AND THAT'S ON PAGE SIX THE SECOND PARAGRAPH. YES THAT SAID THE IT APPEARS THAT THE THE THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION FUHRMAN'S RATIONS ACTUALLY MOVING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION AWAY FROM. AWAY FROM THAT. BUT THOSE THAT BROUGHT THAT IN THE INDUSTRY THAT'S THERE IS OUR WILLINGNESS TO BE ABLE TO TALK OR EVEN DISCUSS EVEN OF THOSE PARAMETERS THAT WERE THERE. POSSIBLY AFTER. TWENTY TWENTY WELL THE THE THERE'S NOW A MYSTERY AUTHOR AS FAR AS TRYING TO SEE OF THE INDUSTRY. IS LOOKING AT SOME OF THOSE -- AREAS THAT WERE IDENTIFIED UNDER THIS RULE -- GET OUT I DON'T I'M NOT REALLY PREPARED TO I I I HAVE I HAVEN'T SPOKE WITH ANYBODY AT CMS ON THAT HAPPY TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT WAY YOU TO DO MORE RESEARCH ON THAT. THANK YOU AND GET INTO THE THE THE AVAILABILITY. OF AS FAR AS THOSE THAT THAT ARE IN THIS PROCESS YOU KNOW. WE HAVE PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH THAT WITH A MEMBER OF MY FAMILY. WHO FIRST IT WAS DIAGNOSED LIFE CHANGES RIGHT NOW AND YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE WHOLE FAMILY COMES IN AND AND TO GET SOME? THE CONSULTATION THAT'S THERE AND HE GOES THROUGH THE DIFFERENT -- ASPECTS THE EFFECTS ON LIFE THE EATING THE THE DIETARY ALL THOSE THINGS -- AND THEN YOU HAVE TO HAS TO GO TO ONE OF THESE CLINICS -- THREE TIMES A WEEK. AND IF YOU MISS THAT APPOINTMENT. YOU HAVE TO EITHER MAKE IT UP ANOTHER DAY OR THIS OR SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO GO FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER. RIGHT SO THAT THE THE QUESTION THAT HAS BEEN RAISED AS FAR AS WILL THIS AFFECT -- THOSE FACILITIES THAT PEOPLE ARE BEING ABLE TO GO TO DURING THAT TIME. IS SOMETHING OF A CONCERN -- ALSO TO MYSELF. GOING THROUGH THAT AND MAKING SURE THAT AND IF YOU MISS THE APPOINTMENT YOU GOTTA GO AND TRY TO FIND ANOTHER PLACE. OR BECAUSE LIFE IS ON THE LINE. THEN AFTER THAT MOVES FOR IF YOU'RE LUCKY ENOUGH YOU'RE ABLE TO GET THE EQUIPMENT AND START TO HAVE THE PROCESS DONE AT HOME. OVER NIGHT OR SOMETIME DURING THE DAY. AND YOUR HONOR A LIST -- FOR KIDNEY TRANSPLANT THINGS ARE BEING WAITED IN MY MIND AS FAR AS WHICH DIRECTION I WILL GO ON THIS BILL. BECAUSE I'VE SEEN THAT WHEN WE START TALKING ABOUT THE AFFECT OF POSSIBLY CLOSING. ANY OF THE AREAS THAT SERVICES -- BECOMES A CONCERN FOR ME AND SEE THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING MOVING FORWARD -- BUT THEN SITTING BACK DOWN WITH THE INDUSTRY TO TRY TO SEE IF THERE IS SOMETHING THAT COULD BE LOOKED AT AS FAR AS MOVING FORWARD -- TO WEAR THIS BILL COULD OFF ULTIMATELY BE. ALSO -- WAY STRONG AND IN MY POSITION SO I CONTINUE TO LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS FROM THIS COMMITTEE AND OTHERS THAT ARE OUT THERE BUT I'M STILL. THINKING PRETTY HARD ABOUT THIS BILL. THE US ROMANCE -- SOME MEMBER WALDRON. THANK YOU -- THIS IS ONE OF THOSE BILLS THAT SERIOUSLY WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME ON BECAUSE THERE'S PROS THERE'S CONS. I MEAN BACK AND FORTH YOU CAN'T REALLY COME TO A SOLID DECISION A LOT OF TIMES BECAUSE ONE PART ONE GROUP SAYS ONE THING AND SOMEONE ELSE'S ANOTHER. AND I'VE I'VE GOT KIND OF A LIST OF THINGS AND I WON'T GO THROUGH ALL OF THEM BECAUSE WE OFFER PRETTY FAMILIAR WITH THEM BUT YOU KNOW. ONE OF THE ARGUMENTS WAS DIALYSIS ON THE PRO SIDE DIALYSIS PROVIDERS A STEERING PEOPLE AWAY FROM MEDICARE AND ALL TO PRIVATE PLANS. TO BASICALLY BENEFIT PROCESS. ON THE OPPOSITION SIDE -- THEY'RE SAYING THEY'RE NOT STEERING WHEEL WORKING WITH PATIENTS TO IDENTIFY THE BEST PATH FOR THE PATIENT GOING FORWARD. ON THE PRO SIDE YOU KNOW ONCE A PATIENT RUNS OUT OF THEIR THIRTY MONTHS OF PRIVATE INSURANCE. THE CLINIC WILL KICK THEM OUT ON THE STREET WITH NO TREATMENT. THE OTHER SIDE SAYS NO BECAUSE THEY GET ON TO MEDICARE WITH THEM THAT'S A PROMISE SO WE'RE YOU KNOW. I'M THINKING OKAY WELL THEY WOULD BE ON MEDICARE -- AT SOME POINT -- THE PRO SIDE SAYS THAT OF THE AMERICAN KIDNEY FUNDS IS ABUSING ITS AUTHORITY. SHOULD ONLY BE PAYING COPAYS NOW PREMIUMS. AMERICAN KIDNEY FUND HAS THE AUTHORITY ON THE OPPOSITION SIDE TO PAY PREMIUMS UNDER FEDERAL REGULATIONS. AND I'M LISTENING TO TESTIMONY TODAY. AND SAYING THAT -- YOU KNOW MEDICAL LOSS RATIO WOULD BE LOWER. POSSIBLY YOU KNOW 1% INCREASE IN PREMIUMS. UP THERE'S NOT A COMMITMENT THAT PATIENT PREMIUMS WOULD BE LOWERED WHICH IS A CONCERN -- ANY SAVINGS ACHIEVED BY PAYING MEDICARE RATES IS BUILT INTO FUTURE PREMIUM MODELS ON THE PRO SIDE. HEALTH PLANS WILL CO A WINDFALL OF SAVINGS. NOT REDUCING THE COST OF TREATMENT. ONE FOUR THOUSAND ENROLLEES ARE OFF SO IT'S LIKE. BACK AND FORTH BUT LIKE TENNIS I MEAN LITERALLY YOU CAN SEE BOTH SIDES OF THE ARGUMENT. AND THE CONCERN OBVIOUSLY FROM ALL OF US IS FOR THE PATIENT AND FOR THEIR ACCESS. SO THE WAY I'M LOOKING AT IT -- AND ONE OF THE POINTS YOU KNOW I'VE RUN A BUSINESS I UNDERSTAND. PROFIT AND ISSUES WITH THAT. LOTS OF TIMES WE RUN A BUSINESS GET A PROFIT BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE OWNERS OF POCKETING IT. BECAUSE IT REALLY GOES INTO THE COST OF RUNNING THE BUSINESS EXPANDING THE BUSINESS -- YOU KNOW. IT CAME UP IN THE HEARING THAT -- FOR THE 10% THAT WOULD BE AFFECTED. THE LOSE AROUND TWENTY FIVE TO FORTY MILLION DOLLARS IN PROFIT. OF FIVE HUNDRED MILLION THAT WAS REPORTED. BUT SINCE MEDICARE'S ONLY COVERING 6280% OF THE COST OF THE TREATMENT. THAT LEAVES 2240% OF TREATMENT COVERED. IF I'M UNDERSTANDING IT RIGHT. SO WHAT IS THE COST OF THAT DIFFERENCE. AND THE MONEY MUST COME OUT OF THE PROFITS. WHERE ELSE WOULD IT BE COMING FROM? SO I MEAN I'M LOOKING AT THIS WALL LOOKED AT IT. THE SITUATION BASICALLY IS AN INDIVIDUAL ON EMPLOYER INSURANCE. THEY END UP YOU KNOW OVER TIME GETTING END STAGE RENAL DISEASE THEY LOSE THEIR JOB BECAUSE OF THE TIME COMMITMENT IT TAKES. TO TREAT. THE DISEASE GOING INTO DIALYSIS THREE TIMES A WEEK OR MORE. THEY WANT TO KEEP THEIR INSURANCE THEY WANT TO KEEP THE CONTINUITY. THE KIDNEY FUND PAYS PREMIUMS FOR UP TO THIRTY MONTHS. AT THE END OF THIRTY MONTHS THEY CAN AUTOMATICALLY BE ENROLLED IN MEDICARE. MEDICARE PAYS 6280% OF THE COST OF DIALYSIS TREATMENT FOR THE OF PATIENTS. PRIVATE INSURANCE IS ABOUT FAVORITE TAKE TIM -- PAYS A HIGHER COST WHICH BASICALLY SUBSIDIZES. THE OTHER PATIENTS. WHO ARE GETTING THE TILES SO THAT'S THE MODEL AT LEAST THE WAY THAT I'M SEEING IT SO? IF THE PATIENT IS WEALTHY AND COMPARE THEIR OWN PREMIUMS THEY DON'T NEED PREMIUM ASSISTANCE THIS BILL DOESN'T AFFECT THEM. SO WE'RE ONLY REALLY TALKING ABOUT THOSE FOLKS WHO ARE LOW INCOME. WHICH IS KIND OF AN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE -- I HAVE THREE DIALYSIS CLINICS IN MY DISTRICT. IF THIS BILL PASSES YOU KNOW THE CONCERN IS ABOUT THEM POSSIBLY CLOSING EVEN IF ONE OF THE THREE CLOSE. YEAH THEY'RE SPREAD ALL OVER OF A LARGE DISTRICT AS YOU KNOW YOU DO AND OTHERS -- THAT MEANS SOME PEOPLE HAVE TO TRAVEL OVER FIFTY MILES TO GET TO A DIALYSIS CLINIC. THAT'S A CONCERN -- ACCESS TO THE HOSPITAL'S KNOW THAT THAT'S WHERE EVERYONE'S GOING TO GO BECAUSE OF WHERE ELSE SOMETHING AND GO -- SO AT THIS POINT I DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH CONTROLLING THE COSTS OF BASICALLY RATE SETTING BECAUSE EVERY TIME WE BRING UP THESE RATE SETTING NO MATTER IF IT'S PHARMACEUTICALS OR OTHER THINGS. WHICH COULD PUT LIVES AND HEALTH OF PEOPLE IN JEOPARDY BY REDUCING ACCESS SO I'M GOING TO BE LAYING OFF THE BILL. TODAY BECAUSE THIS DISCUSSION IS VERY DEEP. AND I JUST WANNA SEE WORK GOALS FOR US FOR OUR PATIENTS. ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS. I JUST -- MAYBE QUICK COMMENT AND THEN -- I DON'T KNOW YOUR QUESTION WILL POP UP -- POP UP AS I'M THINKING HERE -- LAST YEAR -- WHEN THIS BILL CAME UP THEN IT WAS SENATOR LEYVA AS A BILL? AND I HAD I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY THIS LAST YEAR AND AND STARTING OFF WITH THIS I WAS -- ADAMANTLY OPPOSED TO THE BILL THAT AND MOVE FORWARD AND I GOT TO MAYBE MY SEVENTH OR EIGHTH MEETING -- ON THIS ISSUE. AND THE CRUX FOR ME WHERE I BEGAN TO TURN -- WAS WHEN SOMEONE WAS SITTING IN MY OFFICE AND THEY SAID THAT THEY WOULD NOT THE AMERICAN KIDNEY FUND WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO CONTINUE THEIR PREMIUM ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. IF THEY WERE NOT GETTING CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE TWO MAJOR -- BUT ASK DASS SOME COMPANIES. AND IS AT THAT MOMENT THAT I THOUGHT. WHAT'S GOING ON HERE THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE AT ALL. IF THERE IS -- SIXTY THOUSAND CONTRIBUTORS TO THE AMERICAN KIDNEY FUND WHY. CAN'T THEY PROVIDE THIS PREMIUM ASSISTANCE WITH THOSE SIXTY THOUSAND MEMBERS THAT THEY HAVE WHY DO THEY NEED. THE CONTRIBUTIONS FROM JUST A COUPLE OF OF DIFFERENT DIALYSIS CLINICS TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THE PROGRAM WORK AND THAT'S WHEN I WENT -- I NEED TO DIG IN A LITTLE BIT MORE. THAT WE HEARD TODAY -- FROM PHùIT'S ARE BAD I ACTUALLY DON'T BELIEVE THAT PROFITS ARE BAD -- WE LIVE NOT IN A PROFIT SYSTEM -- CAPITALISM IS NOT A PROFIT SYSTEM DOES A PROFIT AND LOSS SYSTEM AND WHEN YOU HAVE. A FEW UNDERSTAND ECONOMICS PROFITS MEAN THAT YOU'RE PROVIDING VALUE -- TO TO FOLKS IF YOU HAVE A LOSS THAT MEANS THAT YOU GOT TO RUN YOUR COMPANY A LITTLE BIT BETTER TO TRY TO GET TO BE ABLE TO GET TO A PROFIT. WHICH ARE TO TALK ABOUT HEALTH CARE HEALTHCARE IS NOT A PURE PROFIT LOSS SYSTEM YOU DON'T HAVE -- A A A PURE MARKET THERE ARE FOLKS THAT ARE GAMING THE SYSTEM WE TALKED ABOUT THIS. A LITTLE BIT A LITTLE BIT LAST YEAR. I AM ALSO CONCERNED BECAUSE I WAS MADE AWARE TODAY THAT I HAVE -- SIXTY INDIVIDUALS IN MY DISTRICT -- THAT ARE -- ON THIS PREMIUM ASSISTANCE PLAN AND I I'M SURE THAT THOSE FOLKS WANT TO CONTINUE -- ON ON THAT PLAN WE HAVE A MAN A MUCH BIGGER PROBLEM WITHIN OUR SYSTEM OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM THAT DOUBLE WE KNOW. THAT UP AS A PERCENTAGE OF OUR GDP IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN HERE IN CALIFORNIA -- WE SPEND MORE PER GDP PER CAPITA THAN VIRTUALLY EVERYWHERE ELSE WHY IS THAT BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A A PURE -- BUT COMPETITIVE OF HEALTH CARE A MARKET SO WE'VE GOT FOLKS THAT ARE COMING TO US IN THEIRS THE TERM OF RENT SEEKING FOLKS ARE COMING TO US ASKING US TO BE ABLE TO MAKE DECISIONS. AND IT IS IT OESN'T IT JUST AT ITS CORE IT DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT THAT FOR A COMPANY TO SAY FOR THEM TO CONTINUE TO BE PROFITABLE THERE HAS TO BE A SCHEME IN WHICH IS A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION ON THE SIDE THAT THEY HAVE TO MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS. TO TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THEIR SYSTEM WORK THAT'S NOT DEFEAT AS FAULT THAT'S NOT FOR SINISE'S FAULT THAT'S THE FACT THAT OUR SYSTEM ISN'T BUILT PROPERLY TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY CAN CONTINUE. TO OPERATE AND THEN WITH THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WHEN THEY CAME IN WITH MAKING SURE THAT THERE'S GUARANTEED ISSUE THAT THROUGH ANOTHER WRENCH IN INTO THE SYSTEM. AND SO I THINK IT'S INCUMBENT UPON US AS LEGISLATORS TO CONTINUE TO KEEP DOING THIS WORK THIS ISN'T GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM. BUT I DO THINK THAT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM COMPREHENSIVELY AND WHEN WE SEE THESE INEFFICIENCIES BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THIS IS IT IS INEFFICIENT. IT'S NOT WRONG IT'S NOT NEFARIOUS IT'S NOT EVIL IT'S NOT OF ALL ABOUT PROFIT MONGERING BUT WHAT IT IS ABOUT IS APT IS INEFFICIENCY THE WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO SOLVE. AND SO FOR TODAY I KNOW THIS ISN'T THIS ISN'T IT THIS IS IN THE THE SOLUTION FOR ALL BUT IT IS A PART OF THE SOLUTION THAT WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO KEEP. TALKING ABOUT I GUESS I DON'T HAVE A QUESTION THERE -- Là MISTER CHAIR -- IN THE IN SO WITH THAT I WOULD AND FOR THE THE ROBUST DISCUSSION LOOK THIS BILL IS NOT INCONSISTENT WITH ALL THE WORK I'VE BEEN DOING FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. BUT YEAR WE DO WE WORK ON A BILL RELATED TO DRUG COUPONS. WHAT ARE THAT BILL DO PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES FOR USING COUPONS AS A WAY TO KEEP PEOPLE ON THEIR HIGHER PRICED MEDICATIONS FOR LONGER WHEN THERE WAS A GENERIC AVAILABLE? INTERESTING WE WE ASK THE COUPONS TO GO AWAY WHAT HAVE WE ASK FOR THAT TO NOT HAPPEN -- THE COUPONS DISAPPEARED EVEN FROM IN THOSE CASES WHERE THEY COULD BE LEGITIMATELY USED IN MANY CASES. WE LOOK AT PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGERS AND TRANSPARENCY AROUND A MIDDLE MAN. THAT GENERATES TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR PROFIT -- WITH THREE COME THIS SENSUALLY THREE COMPANIES 80% OF THE MARKET -- TO THE TWENTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS AS A MIDDLE MAN. WE HEARD SOME REALLY INTERESTING STORIES ABOUT HOW THEY GENERATE THAT THROUGH P. THROUGH REBATES AND SO ON AND WE GOT A TRANSPARENCY BILL PASSED WE HAD SB SEVENTEEN LOOKED AT TRANSPARENCY FOR DRUG PRICE INCREASES. AND THAT BILL AFTER MUCH DEBATE MUCH DISCUSSION OVER TWO YEARS PAST LOOKING AT HOW DO WEEK WE'RE TRYING TO SAVE CONSUMERS. MONEY HERE TRYING TO SAVE THE SYSTEM MONEY WE HAD A BILL LAST YEAR THAT LOOKED AT HEALTH PLAN MERGERS AND OVERSIGHT OVER HEALTH PLAN MERGERS BECAUSE I DON'T NECESSARILY BELIEVE THAT BIGGER IS GOING TO RESULT POSITIVE FOR OUR COMMUNITIES. SO WITH REGARDS TO THIS WITH RELATED TO DIALYSIS THE ONE CONDITION THAT I'M AWARE OF THEIR MAYBE OTHERS IF I'M WRONG I'LL I'LL I'LL DO MORE STUDY. WHERE THERE IS PRESUMPTIVE ELIGIBILITY FOR MEDICARE IMMEDIATELY. YOU DON'T HAVE TO WAIT THIRTY MONTHS TO GET ON MEDICARE AND SO. THIS THIS PAIN FOR A PLAN TO KEEP SOMEBODY ON COMMERCIAL INSURANCE FOR UP TO THIRTY MONTHS -- WHEN THEY COULD BE ON SOMETHING ELSE DOESN'T PROHIBIT SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO STAY ON THEIR PLAN -- DOESN'T PROHIBIT THAT AT ALL BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MY CONVERSATIONS LAST YEAR WITH THE AMERICAN KINNEY FIND WORK THAT THE PEOPLE WHO WERE ACTUALLY GETTING THIS ASSISTANCE WERE MAKING TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR OR LAST. NOW HELP ME TO UNDERSTAND AND IF AND AS I HEARD TODAY AND I WANT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THAT ABOUT THIS. HELP ME TO UNDERSTAND HOW SOMEONE WHO IS WHO'S MAKING TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR OR LESS. CAN PAY FOR ALL OF THE COMPLICATIONS THAT MIGHT ARISE FROM FROM THEIR PLANT FROM FROM THEIR DISEASE. WITH THEIR PRIVATE PLAN. ALL THE CO PAYS FOR HOSPITALIZATION -- FOR OTHER SPECIALISTS THAT MIGHT BE RELATED HOW DO THEY PAY FOR THAT. AND IS IS THE AMERICAN CAN YOU FIND PAY ALL THEIR COPAYS AS WELL. FOR THESE FOR THIS. I'M NOT AWARE THAT THEY DO. HALF OF THE PATIENTS IN CUTTER HERE TWO THOUSAND ARE GETTING HELP WITH MEDICARE ADVANTAGE WHICH WHICH BECOMES AN ALL INCLUSIVE PLAN AT THAT POINT. BUT TWO THOUSAND OR NOT HOW DO THOSE TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE PAY THEIR COPAYS FOR OTHER CONDITIONS THAT ARE UNRELATED TO THEIR DIALYSIS. WHAT WHEN THEY COULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE OR MEDIC CAL? AT THE END OF THE DAY IF WE'RE RELYING ON ONE OR TWO ENTITIES TO FUND THE AMERICAN KIDNEY FUND -- IS THIS AND AND AND AND WE'RE BEING TOLD THAT THAT WILL GO AWAY IF THIS BILL PASSES. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IS THAT IS THAT IS THAT TRULY IT WHEN I GIVE MONEY TO A FIVE OH ONE C. THREE AS A CHARITABLE DONATION I CONSIDERED A TERRIBLE DONATION? IS IT NO LONGER CHARITABLE ANYMORE IF BY MAKING THAT CONTRIBUTION I'M NOT MAKING MONEY ON THE OTHER END. THAT'S THE POINT THAT'S THE POINT IT'S ABOUT THE BIGGER SYSTEM AND WHAT IT'S GOING TO COST US ALL. IT'S CONSIST WITH EVERYTHING I'VE BEEN DOING FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS AS CAN BE CONSISTENT WITH THE OTHER THINGS I LOOK AT IN THE FUTURE. WHAT THAT RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR I. BUT?
