00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:16.301
THINGS YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT OR

INSURING THAT- THIS IS A DIGITAL

00:17:20.239 --> 00:17:22.441
NOW BECOMES LAW THAT WE ACTUALLY

00:17:22.508 --> 00:17:23.175
HAVE THE SHELTER CAPACITY TO

00:17:23.242 --> 00:17:24.643

THE CHAIR. YES THANK YOU FROM.

THE SHORTER AND THE IS BE. PART

00:17:42.327 --> 00:17:43.862
OF THE PART THE PROBLEM WITH THE

00:17:43.929 --> 00:17:45.864
SHELTER SYSTEM IS THAT LET'S

00:17:45.931 --> 00:17:48.233
TAKE- YOU'VE GOT FEMALE SOLDIERS

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:49.802

FAMILY WITH KIDS AND YOU HAVE A

00:17:53.038 --> 00:17:53.939
SON THAT'S TWELFTH IN IN-

00:17:54.006 --> 00:17:55.607
MOTIONAL TO RULES WOULDN'T ALLOW

00:17:55.674 --> 00:17:57.376

SHELTER BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT

00:18:03.649 --> 00:18:04.650
TO SEE THEIR CHILDREN SEPARATED.

00:18:04.716 --> 00:18:05.684
SO THAT'S WHY THIS BILL IS

00:18:05.751 --> 00:18:08.420
FOCUSED ON VOUCHERS FOR ITS

00:18:08.487 --> 00:18:10.355
USUALLY IN- THERE ARE SOME

00:18:10.422 --> 00:18:12.991

YEAH MYSPACE'S PRIVACY IS A

00:33:16.394 --> 00:33:18.629

BUT A LATE WITHIN THE HEALTHCARE

00:33:26.604 --> 00:33:28.139
SYSTEM BUT EVEN WITHIN THE

HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IF YOU'RE NOT

00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:30.441
INVOLVED IN ACTUAL PATIENT CARE

00:33:30.508 --> 00:33:31.809
OF THE PATIENT YOU SHOULD BE

00:33:31.876 --> 00:33:33.511
GETTING. THEIR HEALTH

00:33:33.578 --> 00:33:34.178
INFORMATION RIGHT BECAUSE YOU'RE

00:33:34.245 --> 00:33:34.779

EVEN THOUGH YOU MAY BE WORKING

00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:37.882
IN THE HOSPITAL AND SO FORTH. SO

00:33:37.949 --> 00:33:39.350
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER TO THEIR

00:33:39.417 --> 00:33:41.686
THOUGHTS IN TERMS OF. FOR THE

00:33:41.753 --> 00:33:42.220
AND THE T. THAT. HOW YOU

00:33:42.286 --> 00:33:45.256
INSURED- WHAT YOU THINK MAYBE

00:33:45.323 --> 00:33:48.393
THE- THE BOUNDARIES FOR SHARING

00:33:48.459 --> 00:33:50.461
OF INFORMATION WITHIN THE M. D.

00:33:50.528 --> 00:33:53.364
T. TO PREVENT- I GUESS-

00:33:53.431 --> 00:33:54.799
VENTURING OF INFORMATION PEOPLE

00:33:54.866 --> 00:33:56.134
WHO ACTUALLY AREN'T INVOLVED IN

00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:58.002
PROVIDING SERVICES RIGHT AND I

00:33:58.069 --> 00:33:59.504
REALIZE THAT SOME OF IT MAYBE

00:33:59.570 --> 00:34:00.972
ALSO BECAUSE- YOU'RE EXPLORING

00:34:01.038 --> 00:34:02.373
WHETHER THEY NEED A SERVICE SO.

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:03.508
MAYBE THEY'RE NOT RECEIVING

00:34:03.574 --> 00:34:04.675
SERVICE YET BUT- BUT BASICALLY

00:34:04.742 --> 00:34:06.778
LIMITED AND I GUESS YOU COULD

00:34:06.844 --> 00:34:08.613
SAY NEED TO NOTATE BASIS AND-

00:34:08.679 --> 00:34:09.614
I'M SURE THE DISTRICT MAYBE CAN

00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:11.182
HELP WORK OUT THE LANGUAGE FOR

00:34:11.249 --> 00:34:12.483
HOW HOW YOU WOULD ACTUALLY BUT

00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:14.185
THEN THE CODE. BUT THE BUT AT

00:34:14.252 --> 00:34:16.087
AND I KNOW YOU SO I HAVE

00:34:16.154 --> 00:34:17.755
EXPERIENCE AS A SOCIAL WORKER

00:34:17.822 --> 00:34:19.223
AND SOME OF THESE ISSUES WELL

00:34:19.290 --> 00:34:20.391
BUT MAYBE YOU CAN TRY TO ADDRESS

00:34:20.458 --> 00:34:22.460
SOME OF THAT TO BE HELPFUL. FOR

00:34:22.527 --> 00:34:24.729
ME I THINK IT'S PROBABLY THE OUR

00:34:24.796 --> 00:34:25.897
DOCTOR PAN SENATOR PAM. BUT IT

00:34:25.963 --> 00:34:26.998
GOES TO THE INTAKE PROCESS

00:34:27.064 --> 00:34:28.299
ITSELF AND IT USUALLY HAVING

00:34:28.366 --> 00:34:30.701
BEEN I A DID A GREAT DEAL ABOUT

00:34:30.768 --> 00:34:32.069
WHEN I WAS SOCIAL WORKER. THERE

00:34:32.136 --> 00:34:33.604
ARE FORMS THAT ARE FILLED OUT SO

00:34:33.671 --> 00:34:35.373
IT WOULD BE THEY'LL MAKE GIVING

00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:37.408
CONSENT. BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT

00:34:37.475 --> 00:34:39.277
THE FORM THAT THEY'RE GOING TO

00:34:39.343 --> 00:34:40.311
FILL OUT WHICH WOULD BE MULTI

00:34:40.378 --> 00:34:42.079
OVER THE THREE DISCIPLINES THAT.

00:34:42.146 --> 00:34:43.881
THEY WOULD HAVE TO HAVE A VERY

00:34:43.948 --> 00:34:45.349
IN DEPTH CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT

00:34:45.416 --> 00:34:46.918
IT MEANT IF THEY WERE CONSENTING

00:34:46.984 --> 00:34:48.186
AND IN PARTICULAR IT IS ALL

00:34:48.252 --> 00:34:49.587
ABOUT THE HEALTH ISSUES THE

00:34:49.654 --> 00:34:51.656
PRIVACY THAT. HAVE TO DO WITH

00:34:51.722 --> 00:34:53.191
WHAT PROJECTS HIPPA SO I WOULD

00:34:53.257 --> 00:34:55.493
SEE A FORM THAT ACTUALLY. I HAD

00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:57.261
ABOUT CONSENT ON IT AND THEN

00:34:57.328 --> 00:35:04.202
EXPLAINING WHAT THAT. MEANT TO

00:35:04.268 --> 00:35:05.002
THE INDIVIDUAL WHICH HOUSING

00:35:05.069 --> 00:35:06.137
INTAKE SO WORKER YOU DO. SPEND A

00:35:06.204 --> 00:35:08.139
LOT OF TIME. ON THE FACE TO

00:35:08.206 --> 00:35:10.107
FACE. WHEN YOU'RE DO. IT ONLINE.

00:35:10.174 --> 00:35:11.742
I WOULD SAY THAT. COULD BE PART

00:35:11.809 --> 00:35:12.343
PROBLEMATIC IF IT'S NOT DONE

00:35:12.410 --> 00:35:14.312
FACE TO FACE. WE HAVEN'T REALLY

00:35:14.378 --> 00:35:15.413
CONFRONTED THAT QUESTION BUT I

00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:16.614
THINK THAT SOMETHING THAT. IN

00:35:16.681 --> 00:35:18.583
TERMS OF THIS WHOLE DISCUSSION

00:35:18.649 --> 00:35:19.250
ABOUT THE PRIVACY NEEDS TO COME

00:35:19.317 --> 00:35:21.285
UP. GOT A FORM AND YOU'RE GOING

00:35:21.352 --> 00:35:23.221
OVER IT WITH YOUR CLIENT. AND

00:35:23.287 --> 00:35:24.589
WHAT IT MEANS THAT EACH ONE OF

00:35:24.655 --> 00:35:25.690
THE AREAS THAT YOU'RE PROVIDING

00:35:25.756 --> 00:35:26.290
INFORMATION. I SEE THE HEALTH

00:35:26.357 --> 00:35:28.326
ISSUES HAVE A LOT TO DO WITH

00:35:28.392 --> 00:35:30.261
NUTRITION OKAY. AND WHETHER AND

00:35:30.328 --> 00:35:31.596
THE MEDICATIONS THAT ARE BEING.

00:35:31.662 --> 00:35:32.864
GIVEN AND TAKEN. IT WOULD BE THE

00:35:32.930 --> 00:35:35.533
I THINK THAT. THE CONSENT OF THE

00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:37.702
INDIVIDUAL TO SAY. I HAVE A HIGH

00:35:37.768 --> 00:35:38.369
BLOOD PRESSURE PROBLEM THAT I'M

00:35:38.436 --> 00:35:40.204
TAKING THIS. AND IF THEY DON'T

00:35:40.271 --> 00:35:41.506
WISH TO DISCUSS THAT BUT THAT

00:35:41.572 --> 00:35:43.407
HAS A LOT TO DO WITH NUTRITION.

00:35:43.474 --> 00:35:44.976
THEN THAT'S SOMETHING THAT IS

00:35:45.042 --> 00:35:46.611
LEFT WITH THE CLIENT THE

00:35:46.677 --> 00:35:48.212
INDIVIDUAL. IF THEY WANT TO

00:35:48.279 --> 00:35:50.281
REVEAL THAT. BUT IT SEEMS TO ME

00:35:50.348 --> 00:35:51.616
IF YOU'RE GOING TO EACH ONE OF

00:35:51.682 --> 00:35:53.117
THESE INDIVIDUALLY. THESE

00:35:53.184 --> 00:35:54.552
PROGRAMS YOU HAVE THAT SAME

00:35:54.619 --> 00:35:56.854
ISSUE. IDEA BECAUSE WHAT I WOULD

00:35:56.921 --> 00:35:58.890
DO IS AN INTAKE SUPERVISOR. WE

00:35:58.956 --> 00:36:00.892
WOULD INTERVIEW THE PERSON. THEY

00:36:00.958 --> 00:36:02.493
NEEDED X. Y. NZ WE'D HAVE TO

00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:03.561
SEND THEM TO ALL THOSE

00:36:03.628 --> 00:36:05.229
DIFFERENT. AGENCIES TO GET THAT

00:36:05.296 --> 00:36:06.430
HELP. AND THEY WERE GOING

00:36:06.497 --> 00:36:07.565
THROUGH THE SAME INTERVIEW

00:36:07.632 --> 00:36:09.233
PROCESS THE SAME CONSENT. SO

00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:10.868
THIS IS PUTTING IT ALL WITH ONE

00:36:10.935 --> 00:36:12.270
INDIVIDUAL WHO'S GOING TO DO THE

00:36:12.336 --> 00:36:14.305
INTERVIEW AND I'M ASSUMING. THAT

00:36:14.372 --> 00:36:16.240
THAT TRIAGE WOULD COME WHEN THE

00:36:16.307 --> 00:36:20.678
PERSON APPLIES. FOR SOME SORT OF

00:36:20.745 --> 00:36:21.946
ASSISTANCE. THE OPRAH APPRECIATE

00:36:22.013 --> 00:36:25.116
ANSWER I THINK- AND I AGREE WITH

00:36:25.182 --> 00:36:26.817
YOU THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SOMEONE

00:36:26.884 --> 00:36:28.119
HAVE TO PHYSICALLY GO. ANSWER

00:36:28.185 --> 00:36:30.221
THE SAME QUESTIONS OVER AND OVER

00:36:30.288 --> 00:36:31.255
AGAIN FOR EACH DIFFERENT PROGRAM

00:36:31.322 --> 00:36:32.790
AND THAT'S PROBABLY WHAT THE MDT

00:36:32.857 --> 00:36:33.658
WILL HELP ADDRESS. I THINK THE

00:36:33.724 --> 00:36:35.826
PART THAT. PERHAPS COULD USE A

00:36:35.893 --> 00:36:37.028
CLARIFICATION RIGHT BECAUSE AT

00:36:37.094 --> 00:36:38.763
LEAST BUT THAT'S LIKE. WHEN YOU

00:36:38.829 --> 00:36:40.598
WENT EACH PROGRAM YOU KNEW THAT

00:36:40.665 --> 00:36:41.465
THAT PROGRAM TO GET THE

00:36:41.532 --> 00:36:42.500
INFORMATION YOU CAN AND YOU

00:36:42.567 --> 00:36:43.968
MIGHT DECIDE REFUSE THE ANSWER

00:36:44.035 --> 00:36:45.703
FOR ONE PROGRAMS YOU THINK

00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:46.704
WASN'T RELEVANT TO THEM THAN THE

00:36:46.771 --> 00:36:48.205
OTHER SO NOW YOU HAVE ONE AND

00:36:48.272 --> 00:36:49.941
TWO. SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

00:36:50.007 --> 00:36:51.442
THEY KNOW THAT OKAY IF I DO THE

00:36:51.509 --> 00:36:53.978
ONE INTAKE EXACTLY WHO'S GOING

00:36:54.045 --> 00:36:55.212
TO GO TO. AND ALSO THAT. AND

00:36:55.279 --> 00:36:57.248
I'M- AND AGAIN NOT TRYING TO PUT

00:36:57.315 --> 00:36:58.749
THE ENTIRE BURDEN ON THE PERSON

00:36:58.816 --> 00:36:59.717
RECEIVING THE SERVICES THAT

00:36:59.784 --> 00:37:01.752
THERE WILL BE A BEST JUDGMENT

00:37:01.819 --> 00:37:03.287
THAT. INFORMATION THAT IS

00:37:03.354 --> 00:37:05.189
NECESSARY TO BE SHARED THAT THEY

00:37:05.256 --> 00:37:06.657
MAY HAVE GIVEN ON THE INTAKE.

00:37:06.724 --> 00:37:08.159
WOULD NOT TO BE SHARED WITH

00:37:08.225 --> 00:37:09.827
AGENCIES WERE THAT WOULD BE

00:37:09.894 --> 00:37:11.495
RELEVANT TO THEM RIGHT SO THAT

00:37:11.562 --> 00:37:12.997
WE WOULD DO AN INTAKE. YOU'D BE

00:37:13.064 --> 00:37:13.631
GATHERING THIS INFORMATION BUT

00:37:13.698 --> 00:37:15.199
ONLY THE- INFORMATION THAT'S

00:37:15.266 --> 00:37:17.234
NECESSARY. FOR THE OTHER

00:37:17.301 --> 00:37:18.502
AGENCIES WHO MAY BE PART OF ME

00:37:18.569 --> 00:37:20.404
IN THE M. B. T. IT'S ADDRESS SO

00:37:20.471 --> 00:37:23.140
THAT WE CAN GET THEM THE WHOLE.

00:37:23.207 --> 00:37:24.275
SET OF SERVICES THAT ONLY THE

00:37:24.342 --> 00:37:25.476

00:37:25.543 --> 00:37:28.346
RELEVANT ARE NECESSARY FOR THAT-AGENCY TO HAVE WOULD BE SURE TO

00:37:28.412 --> 00:37:30.448
NOT MISS OF THE ENTIRE INTAKE

00:37:30.514 --> 00:37:31.749
WHICH MAY BE MORE COMPREHENSIVE.

00:37:31.816 --> 00:37:33.618
IN ORDER TO TRY TO COVER ALL THE

00:37:33.684 --> 00:37:34.852
DIFFERENT BASES. SELL SELL LEADS

00:37:37.622 --> 00:37:39.056
THAT THAT CAN BE SORTED OUT BUT

00:37:39.123 --> 00:37:41.425

YOU GUYS. AT THE RISK OF

00:39:07.344 --> 00:39:08.479
SOUNDING REDUNDANT VERY- HAPPY

00:39:08.546 --> 00:39:10.648
TO KNOW AS IT WAS IN THE

00:39:10.715 --> 00:39:11.649
ANALYSIS THAT THE LANGUAGE

00:39:11.716 --> 00:39:12.283
AROUND CONSENT IS GOING TO BE

00:39:12.349 --> 00:39:13.484
HASHED OUT IN- JUDICIARY. I

00:39:13.551 --> 00:39:15.419
DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT DURING

00:39:15.486 --> 00:39:16.854
COLD IT I HAPPEN TO WATCH THAT

00:39:16.921 --> 00:39:18.789
MOVIE I CARE A LOT. AND IT'S-

00:39:18.856 --> 00:39:20.925
INTENSE IN TERMS OF HOW THE

00:39:20.991 --> 00:39:24.395
ELDERLY FOLKS AT CAN BE AND ARE

00:39:24.462 --> 00:39:25.963
ROUTINELY TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF.

00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:28.332
YEAH A LOT OF IT HAS TO DO WITH-

00:39:28.399 --> 00:39:32.036
THEIR INFORMATION AND HOW IT IS

00:39:32.103 --> 00:39:34.004
SHARED AND SO- JUST ALSO HOPING

00:39:34.071 --> 00:39:34.805
THAT THERE'S CONTINUED

00:39:34.872 --> 00:39:36.073
DISCUSSION AND THOUGHT AROUND

00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:37.708
CHECKS AND BALANCES BECAUSE I DO

00:39:37.775 --> 00:39:38.609
THINK THERE'S A DIFFERENCE

00:39:38.676 --> 00:39:41.345
BETWEEN WHAT. THE CLIENT NEEDS.

00:39:41.412 --> 00:39:43.180
AND THEN WHAT PEOPLE THINK THE

00:39:43.247 --> 00:39:45.683
CLIENT NEEDS AND OFTEN TIMES WE

00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:48.219
PUT A LOT IN THAT LATTER BUCKET

00:39:48.285 --> 00:39:50.121
BECAUSE SOMEONE IS ELDERLY

00:39:50.187 --> 00:39:51.255
BECAUSE MAYBE THEY SEEM

00:39:51.322 --> 00:39:53.457
FORGETFUL OR BE YOU KNOW BECAUSE

00:39:53.524 --> 00:39:55.192
LIKE YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU

00:39:55.259 --> 00:39:58.162
NEED- YOU KNOW I. MOTHER SAYS

00:39:58.229 --> 00:40:02.233
THAT A LOT. WHEN I'M TALKING TO

00:40:02.299 --> 00:40:03.934
HER- AND THE REALITY IS THAT

00:40:04.001 --> 00:40:05.169
MANY ELDERLY FOLKS DO NOT WHAT

00:40:05.236 --> 00:40:06.837
THEY NEED AND THEY DO KNOW WHAT

00:40:06.904 --> 00:40:08.839
THEY WANT AND SO HOW DO WE- MAKE

00:40:08.906 --> 00:40:11.041
SURE THAT THERE'S A FRAMEWORK IN

00:40:11.108 --> 00:40:12.209
PLACE. THAT DOESN'T TAKE

00:40:12.276 --> 00:40:14.111
ADVANTAGE OF THEM THAT DOESN'T

00:40:14.178 --> 00:40:15.980
DISMISS OR MARGINALIZE THE

00:40:16.046 --> 00:40:17.615
THINGS THAT THEY BELIEVE ARE

00:40:17.681 --> 00:40:19.817
IMPORTANT FOR THEM- BECAUSE THE

00:40:19.884 --> 00:40:21.719
OTHER PART THAT WE KNOW. IS THAT

00:40:21.786 --> 00:40:23.220
THERE'S A LOT OF MONEY TO BE

00:40:23.287 --> 00:40:25.389
MADE OFF THE BACKS OF THE

00:40:25.456 --> 00:40:26.457
ELDERLY- AND SO ALSO HOW DO WE

00:40:26.524 --> 00:40:28.159
CREATE A FRAMEWORK THAT ALSO IS

00:40:28.225 --> 00:40:29.493
VERY HONEST ABOUT THAT BECAUSE

00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:32.163
OFTEN TIMES PEOPLE MAY. SUGGEST

00:40:32.229 --> 00:40:35.199
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES- BECAUSE

00:40:35.266 --> 00:40:36.834
REIMBURSEMENT RATES ARE YOU JUST

00:40:36.901 --> 00:40:38.369
BECAUSE THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY

00:40:38.435 --> 00:40:40.204
TO MAKE MONEY OFF THE BACKS OF

00:40:40.271 --> 00:40:41.939
THE SENIOR AND SO. THAT CAN ALSO

00:40:42.006 --> 00:40:43.941
COMPLICATE THINGS SO HOPING THAT

00:40:44.008 --> 00:40:46.510
SOME OF THAT IS ALSO INFUSED IN

00:40:46.577 --> 00:40:47.511
