OF THE NO VOTES CAME FROM THAT

00:37:06.757 --> 00:37:08.759
AREA. A ONCE WE DID SOME

00:37:08.826 --> 00:37:09.860
RESEARCH BECAUSE I WANT TO FIND

00:37:09.927 --> 00:37:11.062

THOUGHT WELL YOU KNOW WE HAD

00:37:13.164 --> 00:37:15.099
ABOUT A FIFTY PERCENT RATE IN

00:37:15.166 --> 00:37:15.366
ALL AREAS.

00:37:15.433 --> 00:37:16.367
.

00:37:16.434 --> 00:37:17.868
WHEN WE FOUND OUT THIS THE STATE

00:37:17.935 --> 00:37:20.504
HOSPITAL AREA WAS SEVENTY ONE

00:37:20.571 --> 00:37:22.306
PERCENT AND AGAINST THIS AND ALL

00:37:22.373 --> 00:37:23.741
THE REST OF OUR DISTRICTS FOR

ABOUT FIFTY PERCENT. WE SING

00:37:26.210 --> 00:37:26.711
THIS WAY SO WE START LOOKING

00:37:26.777 --> 00:37:27.712
INTO LAW.

00:37:27.778 --> 00:37:29.146
ARE THESE ARE THE PEOPLE OUT

00:37:29.213 --> 00:37:30.615
THERE ALLOWED VOTE SO WE STARTED

00:37:30.681 --> 00:37:31.315
SPECIFICALLY LOOK AT THE

00:37:31.382 --> 00:37:32.617
DOMICILE LAW SECTION THREE FORTY

00:37:32.683 --> 00:37:34.318
NINE.

00:37:34.385 --> 00:37:34.852
WORD STATES THAT THEY'RE

00:37:34.919 --> 00:37:35.953
SUPPOSED TO BE FIX THEIR INTENSE

00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:37.922
REMAIN AND THEIR INTENT TO

00:37:37.989 --> 00:37:39.991
RETURN IF AN ABSENCE.

00:37:40.057 --> 00:37:42.093
I SEE THAT PROBABLY TWO OF THESE

00:37:42.159 --> 00:37:43.694
THINGS THAT THERE IS ABSOLUTELY

00:37:43.761 --> 00:37:45.496
NO CAPABILITY FOR THEM TO RETURN

00:37:45.563 --> 00:37:46.697
TO THAT IF THERE APPS ON THAT

00:37:46.764 --> 00:37:47.765
SCENARIO.

00:37:47.832 --> 00:37:47.932
AND.

00:37:47.999 --> 00:37:50.401
.

00:37:50.468 --> 00:37:51.202
NONE OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE FROM

00:37:51.268 --> 00:37:52.470
KALANGA.

00:37:52.536 --> 00:37:54.305
SO.

00:37:54.372 --> 00:37:55.239
I THINK THE CURRENT LAW AS IT

00:37:55.306 --> 00:37:57.208
SITS.

00:37:57.274 --> 00:37:59.577
TOM IS IT IS IT IS IS A GOOD LAW

00:37:59.644 --> 00:38:00.411
BUT I THINK IT NEEDS TO BE

00:38:00.478 --> 00:38:01.479
CLARIFIED WERE CURRENTLY GOING

00:38:01.545 --> 00:38:02.880

00:38:06.250 --> 00:38:07.852
SECTION TO CUT TWENTY TWENTY

00:38:07.918 --> 00:38:08.753
FIVE.

00:38:08.819 --> 00:38:10.788
NOTHING AGAINST THE PEOPLE OUT

00:38:10.855 --> 00:38:12.323

YOU KNOW HOWEVER I CAN TELL YOU

00:38:13.457 --> 00:38:15.026
THAT OUR COMMUNITIES

00:38:15.092 --> 00:38:16.927
ARE LIVID THE WHOLE CENTRAL

00:38:16.994 --> 00:38:18.696
VALLEY IS UNHAPPY WITH THIS.

00:38:18.763 --> 00:38:21.365
ON MY WAY UP HERE I ASKED PEOPLE.

THIS IS A MINORITY AMOUNTS OF

00:38:36.547 --> 00:38:37.882

DON'T HAVE AN ANTENNA.

00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:43.934

00:41:44.001 --> 00:41:45.769
TOLD HIM.

00:41:45.836 --> 00:41:49.206
SO THEY DON'T HAVE THAT INTO.

IT'S IT CHANGES ALL THE TIME

00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:04.755

THE HOSPITAL INTAKE AND OTHER

THE FUNDING ISSUES IN COALINGA

00:43:43.954 --> 00:43:45.456
AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE

00:43:45.522 --> 00:43:46.991
CONSTITUENCY HERE MIGHT NOT BE

00:43:47.057 --> 00:43:48.993
THE MOST SYMPATHETIC POPULATION.

00:43:49.059 --> 00:43:50.160
BUT WE THINK CHANGE IN THE

00:43:50.227 --> 00:43:51.628
VOTING RIGHTS OF JUST ONE

00:43:51.695 --> 00:43:53.964

OUTCOME OF ONE ELECTION IS ON

00:43:55.799 --> 00:43:57.534
SOUND PUBLIC POLICY. IT'S

00:43:57.601 --> 00:43:58.969
IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE SPELL

00:43:59.036 --> 00:44:02.172
ONLY TARGETS ONE SET OF PATIENTS

00:44:02.239 --> 00:44:03.674
AT THE STATE HOSPITAL NOT.

00:44:03.741 --> 00:44:04.808
THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN ADJUDICATED

00:44:04.875 --> 00:44:06.910
A SEXUALLY VIOLENT PREDATOR NOT

00:44:06.977 --> 00:44:07.911
THE OTHER PATIENTS THAT RESIDE

00:44:07.978 --> 00:44:09.346
THERE. ITS MARGIN OF THAT THESE

00:44:09.413 --> 00:44:10.914
ARE PATIENTS THEIR CIVILLY

00:44:10.981 --> 00:44:12.516
COMMITTED NOT CRIMINALLY

00:44:12.583 --> 00:44:13.951
COMMITTED LIBERTIES SERVE THEIR

00:44:14.018 --> 00:44:15.652
CRIMINAL SENSE AND LIKE MANY

00:44:15.719 --> 00:44:17.521
OTHERS OF CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS

00:44:17.588 --> 00:44:19.390
IN THE STATE. THEY HAVE VOTING

00:44:19.456 --> 00:44:21.125
RIGHTS AFTERWARDS AS LONG AS

00:44:21.191 --> 00:44:22.393
THEY MEET THE OTHER VOTING

00:44:22.459 --> 00:44:24.294
CRITERIA. ALSO POINTED OUT THAT

00:44:24.361 --> 00:44:26.330
THESE ARE LENGTHY CIVIL

00:44:26.397 --> 00:44:26.997
COMMITMENTS

00:44:27.064 --> 00:44:28.532
AS THE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT SINCE

00:44:28.599 --> 00:44:29.867
TWO THOUSAND SIX ABOUT A

00:44:29.933 --> 00:44:31.535
THOUSAND OF THESE PATIENTS HAVE

00:44:31.602 --> 00:44:32.102
BEEN COMMITTED TO THE STATE

00:44:32.169 --> 00:44:34.571
HOSPITAL. IN A DOZEN YEARS LATER

00:44:34.638 --> 00:44:35.873
EIGHTY PERCENT OF THEM REMAIN

00:44:35.939 --> 00:44:37.374
THERE SO THEY'RE IN THIS

00:44:37.441 --> 00:44:38.876
HOSPITAL FOR A SIGNIFICANT

00:44:38.942 --> 00:44:40.544
AMOUNT OF TIME.

00:44:40.611 --> 00:44:41.745
UNDER CURRENT LAW THEY CAN

00:44:41.812 --> 00:44:42.713
REGISTER TO VOTE AND THE

00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:44.381
COMMUNITIES THAT THEY CAN RESIDE

00:44:44.448 --> 00:44:46.517
FROM BUT THE SPELL ONLY LIMITS

00:44:46.583 --> 00:44:48.352
THEM TO THAT REGION. AND WE

00:44:48.419 --> 00:44:49.653
THINK THAT'S ON SOUND POLICY

00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:50.921
PUBLIC POLICY THAT'S NOT WHERE

00:44:50.988 --> 00:44:52.356
THEY LIVE THEY'RE NOT BEEN

00:44:52.423 --> 00:44:54.858
IMPACTED BY. THE LOCAL DECISIONS

00:44:54.925 --> 00:44:56.560

00:44:58.896 --> 00:44:59.863
ANYMORE THEY'VE ALREADY SERVED A

00:44:59.930 --> 00:45:01.565
CRIMINAL SENTENCE NOW THEY HAVE

00:45:01.632 --> 00:45:02.966
A LINK THE CIVIL COMMITMENT

00:45:03.033 --> 00:45:04.668
SIGNIFICANT TIME HAS PASSED.

00:45:04.735 --> 00:45:06.170
THEY MAY NO LONGER HAVE FAMILY

00:45:06.236 --> 00:45:08.372
OR COMMUNITY TIES TO THE REGION

00:45:08.439 --> 00:45:09.973
THEY CAME FROM. IT'S ALSO%

00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:10.974
IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT THE CITY

00:45:11.041 --> 00:45:12.776
DID MAKE A CHOICE HERE THEY

00:45:12.843 --> 00:45:14.545
CHOSE TO ANNEX THE HOSPITAL. AND

00:45:14.611 --> 00:45:16.413
THAT CREATED TAX BENEFITS FOR

00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:18.048
THE CITY BUT IT ALSO GAVE

00:45:18.115 --> 00:45:19.516
PATIENTS AT THAT HOSPITAL THE

00:45:19.583 --> 00:45:21.318
RIGHT TO VOTE IN THAT AREA. AND

00:45:21.385 --> 00:45:22.786
NOW WE UNDERSTAND THE

00:45:22.853 --> 00:45:23.887
DISSATISFACTION WITH THESE

00:45:23.954 --> 00:45:25.322
ELECTION RESULTS BUT

FOR THE CITY NEVERTHELESS

00:50:27.457 --> 00:50:28.592
THERE'S A THERE'S IMPORTANT

00:50:28.658 --> 00:50:30.160
PRINCIPLE STAKE HERE.

00:50:30.227 --> 00:50:31.762
WHAT AB TWO EIGHTY NINE IS

ATTEMPTING TO DO IS TO ENSURE

00:50:33.063 --> 00:50:34.865
THAT THE CITY OF COALINGA CAN

00:50:34.931 --> 00:50:36.600

00:50:40.771 --> 00:50:42.672
SPENT.

00:50:42.739 --> 00:50:44.875
THIS IS TAXATION WITHOUT

00:50:44.941 --> 00:50:46.676
REPRESENTATION PUT IT SUCCINCTLY.

00:50:46.743 --> 00:50:47.911
AND THAT'S WHY THE REASONS WHY

00:50:47.978 --> 00:50:48.445
THIS COUNTRY DECLARED ITS

00:50:48.512 --> 00:50:50.180
INDEPENDENCE.

00:50:50.247 --> 00:50:51.782
THE BILL AUTHORED AT THE BEHEST

00:50:51.848 --> 00:50:53.650
OF THE CITY COALINGA IS

00:50:53.717 --> 00:50:55.419
PROFOUNDLY UNAMERICAN BOTH IN

00:50:55.485 --> 00:50:57.821
ITS EFFECT AND IN THIS INTENT.

00:50:57.888 --> 00:50:58.789
THE CITY IS TRYING TO

00:50:58.855 --> 00:51:00.023
DISENFRANCHISE A GROUP OF ITS

00:51:00.090 --> 00:51:01.591
OWN CITIZENS.

00:51:01.658 --> 00:51:03.293
BECAUSE THEY DO NOT LIKE THE WAY

00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:04.060
THAT THEY VOTED AND CITY

00:51:04.127 --> 00:51:05.996
ELECTION.

00:51:06.062 --> 00:51:07.130
I RECOMMEND THAT THE COMMITTEE

00:51:07.197 --> 00:51:07.697

00:51:07.764 --> 00:51:09.699
AND.

00:51:09.766 --> 00:51:11.701
IF I MAY ADD THERE IS A SOLUTION

00:51:11.768 --> 00:51:13.437
IF THEY DON'T WANT.

00:51:13.503 --> 00:51:14.905
THE PATIENTS TO PARTICIPATE IN

00:51:14.971 --> 00:51:16.072
THE CITY ELECTION AND THAT IS TO

00:51:16.139 --> 00:51:17.274
TAKE THAT SQUARE MILE THAT

00:51:17.340 --> 00:51:18.708

DROPPED THE POPULATION THAT CITY

00:51:24.981 --> 00:51:27.117
BY FIVE THOUSAND.

00:51:27.184 --> 00:51:27.717

BUT OF COURSE WANT TO MAKE A

00:54:05.008 --> 00:54:06.476
SOME OF THOSE POINTS ON RECORD I

00:54:06.543 --> 00:54:08.712
HEAR IN THE PUBLIC FORUM. AYE IS

00:54:08.778 --> 00:54:10.814
WELL I IN I DO THINK THAT THERE

00:54:10.880 --> 00:54:12.949
ARE SOME A POTENTIAL ALTERNATIVE

00:54:13.016 --> 00:54:15.652
SIDE TO WHAT TO THIS AS A AS A

00:54:15.719 --> 00:54:16.620
BILL.

00:54:16.686 --> 00:54:17.954
BOB OF ONE OF THE ISSUES SIDE

00:54:18.021 --> 00:54:19.656
THAT I THINK AS BEEN BROUGHT UP

00:54:19.723 --> 00:54:20.624
AND SHOULD BE A KIND OF

00:54:20.690 --> 00:54:22.225
FLUSHABLE BIT. LIES THAT

00:54:22.292 --> 00:54:23.560
ACCORDING TO THE STATE HOSPITALS

00:54:23.627 --> 00:54:26.029
AYE ONE THOUSAND FIFTY EIGHT OF

00:54:26.096 --> 00:54:27.597
THE SEXUALLY VIOLENT PREDATORS I

00:54:27.664 --> 00:54:28.832
HAVE BEEN COMMITTED TO CALLING A

00:54:28.898 --> 00:54:30.300
STATE HOSPITAL SINCE TWO

00:54:30.367 --> 00:54:32.202
THOUSAND SIX. UP BUT ONLY TWO

00:54:32.268 --> 00:54:34.704
HUNDRED AND TWENTY OR TWENTY

00:54:34.771 --> 00:54:35.905
PERCENT HAVE BEEN RELEASED

00:54:35.972 --> 00:54:37.007
SORT APPEARS THAT A VAST

00:54:37.073 --> 00:54:38.975
MAJORITY THESE PERSONS WILL LIVE

00:54:39.042 --> 00:54:40.644
AT THE HOSPITAL FOR A LONG TIME.

00:54:40.710 --> 00:54:41.778
AND PROBABLY FOR THE REST THEIR

00:54:41.845 --> 00:54:43.079
LIVES I THINK OF WHERE THE

00:54:43.146 --> 00:54:45.048
TESTIMONIES WASN'T UP TO NINETY

00:54:45.115 --> 00:54:47.083
FIVE PERCENT OF THE FOLKS OUT

00:54:47.150 --> 00:54:48.785
MAYBE A FIT INTO THIS CATEGORY.

00:54:48.852 --> 00:54:50.020
AYE SO THE QUESTION I WOULD POSE

00:54:50.086 --> 00:54:51.521
IS OUT WHY SHOULD THEY BE

00:54:51.588 --> 00:54:54.324
REQUIRED TO VOTE IN A PRECINCT

00:54:54.391 --> 00:54:55.458
IN WHICH THEY NO LONGER LIVE.

00:54:55.525 --> 00:54:56.993
I AND THEY ARE HIGHLY UNLIKELY

00:54:57.060 --> 00:54:59.162
TO RETURN.

00:54:59.229 --> 00:55:00.697
I BELIEVE THAT THIS MEASURE IS

00:55:00.764 --> 00:55:02.432
CONSISTENT WITH AN ACTION THAT

00:55:02.499 --> 00:55:04.034
THIS COMMITTEE ITSELF TOOK JUST

00:55:04.100 --> 00:55:05.869
LAST MONTH.

00:55:05.935 --> 00:55:07.570
WHEN IT PASSED AB TWENTY ONE

00:55:07.637 --> 00:55:09.572
SEVENTY TWO WHICH IS NOW CLEARED

00:55:09.639 --> 00:55:11.341
THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR AS WELL.

00:55:11.408 --> 00:55:13.543
WHICH REQUIRES THE CDC ARE TO

00:55:13.610 --> 00:55:14.711
PROVIDE INFORMATION TO THE

00:55:14.778 --> 00:55:15.912
CITIZENS REDISTRICTING

00:55:15.979 --> 00:55:18.148
COMMISSION REGARDING THE LAST

00:55:18.214 --> 00:55:20.216
KNOWN PLACE OF ADDRESS OF EACH

00:55:20.283 --> 00:55:21.818
IN INMATE WHO WAS IN A FACILITY

00:55:21.885 --> 00:55:23.420
THAT IS UNDER THE CDC OURS

00:55:23.486 --> 00:55:25.155
CONTROL. SO THAT THE INMATES CAN

00:55:25.221 --> 00:55:26.790
BE COUNTED IN THE COMMUNITY THAT

00:55:26.856 --> 00:55:28.024
THEY CAME FROM.

00:55:28.091 --> 00:55:29.492
IF THEY'RE COUNTED FOR THE

00:55:29.559 --> 00:55:31.494
PURPOSES OF DECIDING WHO THEIR

00:55:31.561 --> 00:55:33.797
ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES ARE.

00:55:33.863 --> 00:55:35.231
I BELIEVE THAT THEY CAN VOTE IN

00:55:35.298 --> 00:55:37.567
THAT SAME DOMICILE. IF WE AS A

00:55:37.634 --> 00:55:38.568
STATE IN THIS COMMITTEE HAS

00:55:38.635 --> 00:55:40.403
TAKEN THAT ACTION I BELIEVE THAT

00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:41.705
THIS IS CONSISTENT. WITH THAT

00:55:41.771 --> 00:55:43.673
PREVIOUS MEASURE.

00:55:43.740 --> 00:55:45.241
AND I APPRECIATE OTHER POINTS ON

00:55:45.308 --> 00:55:46.710
THAT AND THAT'S PART OF WHY IT

00:55:46.776 --> 00:55:48.478
ACTUALLY ARGUED IN OPPOSITION TO

00:55:48.545 --> 00:55:49.946
THAT PARTICULAR BILL EVEN THOUGH

00:55:50.013 --> 00:55:52.849
I RECOGNIZE THAT IT PASSED.

00:55:52.916 --> 00:55:54.951
BUT SPECIFICALLY IN THIS

00:55:55.018 --> 00:55:55.585
SITUATION.

00:55:55.652 --> 00:55:57.721
VOTERS IN THE CALLING A STATE

00:55:57.787 --> 00:55:59.355
HOSPITAL ARE DIRECTLY AFFECTED

00:55:59.422 --> 00:56:01.357
BY LOCAL SALES TAXES ARE WHEN

00:56:01.424 --> 00:56:02.358
THEY BUY GOODS IN THE HOSPITAL

00:56:02.425 --> 00:56:03.727
IS TESTIFIED HERE IN THE

00:56:03.793 --> 00:56:05.628
CONVENIENCE STORE THE RESTAURANT.

00:56:05.695 --> 00:56:07.197
BY THE COPY CENTER AYE IN OTHER

00:56:07.263 --> 00:56:09.666
BUSINESSES UP WHY SHOULDN'T THEY

00:56:09.733 --> 00:56:12.302
BE ABLE TO VOTE ON A TAX MEASURE

00:56:12.368 --> 00:56:14.170
THAT DIRECTLY AFFECTS HOW MUCH

00:56:14.237 --> 00:56:16.239
THEY PAY ON THOSE GOODS. WILL I

00:56:16.306 --> 00:56:17.974
I ACTUALLY ONE OF REFERENCE IF I

00:56:18.041 --> 00:56:20.677
CAN THE CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS

00:56:20.744 --> 00:56:21.878
TESTIMONY I THOUGHT IT WAS.

00:56:21.945 --> 00:56:24.047
POWERFUL THAT FROM OUR SERVICE

00:56:24.114 --> 00:56:25.782
MEMBERS ARE NOT US AFFORDED THE

00:56:25.849 --> 00:56:27.484
SAME OPPORTUNITY.

00:56:27.550 --> 00:56:29.753
THAT THEY MAY HAVE BEEN HOUSED

00:56:29.819 --> 00:56:31.387
IN A COMMUNITY THAT PASSED A

00:56:31.454 --> 00:56:32.922
SALES TAX MEASURE THAT THEY

00:56:32.989 --> 00:56:35.058
COULD NOT VOTE ON. BUT THEY

00:56:35.125 --> 00:56:36.326
THEMSELVES WILL ALSO HAVE TO PAY

00:56:36.392 --> 00:56:37.861
FOR THAT TAX.

00:56:37.927 --> 00:56:40.230
SO I WOULD ALIGN MY COMMENTS IN

00:56:40.296 --> 00:56:41.664
RESPONSE TO THAT QUESTION TO THE

00:56:41.731 --> 00:56:43.633
CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS COMMENTS.

00:56:43.700 --> 00:56:44.934
AND I RESPECTFULLY SEE THE

00:56:45.001 --> 00:56:46.269
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE IN THAT

00:56:46.336 --> 00:56:47.971
SOMEONE WHO SERVES ON A MILITARY

00:56:48.037 --> 00:56:49.672
BASE AYE IS IN A MUCH MORE

00:56:49.739 --> 00:56:51.508
TEMPORARY SITUATION WHERE IS I

00:56:51.574 --> 00:56:51.841
THINK THAT.

00:56:51.908 --> 00:56:54.511
IN THIS SITUATION AYE THE

00:56:54.577 --> 00:56:56.479
TESTIMONY AND THE.

00:56:56.546 --> 00:56:57.814
THE BACKGROUND HIS.

00:56:57.881 --> 00:56:59.415
I TESTED THAT FOLKS ONCE THEY'RE

00:56:59.482 --> 00:57:01.551
LIVING HERE TEN TEN TO LIVE HERE

00:57:01.618 --> 00:57:03.019
WITHIN MABILLE ALLOW ME ONE

00:57:03.086 --> 00:57:04.187
CHARTER STEP BECAUSE.

00:57:04.254 --> 00:57:06.289
THE MAYOR'S.

00:57:06.356 --> 00:57:07.991
POINT SHOULDN'T BE LOST THAT.

00:57:08.057 --> 00:57:10.126
WE HAVE A CITY IN MY COUNTY THAT

00:57:10.193 --> 00:57:11.928
REALLY HAS DONE EVERYTHING THAT

00:57:11.995 --> 00:57:13.663
THE STATE HAS ASKED OF.

00:57:13.730 --> 00:57:15.532
THAT IS ATTEMPTING TO.

00:57:15.598 --> 00:57:17.901
WHILE WE HAVE MANY NIMBY ISMS

00:57:17.967 --> 00:57:19.903
NOT IN MY BACKYARD WE HAD A CITY

00:57:19.969 --> 00:57:21.704
THAT WAS WILLING.

00:57:21.771 --> 00:57:23.640
AND HAS HOUSED A STATE HOSPITAL

00:57:23.706 --> 00:57:25.341
IN OUR COMMUNITY.

00:57:25.408 --> 00:57:27.043
BUT THIS IS A CITY THAT IS

00:57:27.110 --> 00:57:28.912
STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW OUR

00:57:28.978 --> 00:57:30.847
HOSPITAL CLOSED THIS WEEK.

00:57:30.914 --> 00:57:32.982
AND WERE STRUGGLING AS A CITY TO

00:57:33.049 --> 00:57:35.285
RETAIN THE POLICE OFFICERS AND

00:57:35.351 --> 00:57:37.253
FIREFIGHTERS THAT ARE NEEDED.

00:57:37.320 --> 00:57:39.155
FOR OUR COMMUNITY TO THRIVE AND

00:57:39.222 --> 00:57:40.924
WERE TRYING TO FIND SOLUTIONS

00:57:40.990 --> 00:57:43.560
AND. REALLY WOULD ASK THAT THE

00:57:43.626 --> 00:57:44.928
MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE LOOK

00:57:44.994 --> 00:57:46.129
AT THE FACT THAT THIS IS A

00:57:46.196 --> 00:57:47.397
DISTRICT BILL.

00:57:47.463 --> 00:57:48.898
ONE THAT WILL AFFECT.

00:57:48.965 --> 00:57:51.467
BUT MEMBERS FROM MY COMMUNITY

00:57:51.534 --> 00:57:51.668
AND.

00:57:51.734 --> 00:57:53.369
AS THEIR ADVOCATE I'M TRYING TO

00:57:53.436 --> 00:57:54.804
FIGHT FOR.

00:57:54.871 --> 00:57:56.773
THE ALL MEMBERS OF MY COMMUNITY

00:57:56.840 --> 00:57:58.274
AND I BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL

00:57:58.341 --> 00:57:59.642
HELPS US TO DO THAT.

00:57:59.709 --> 00:58:01.411
IN AND I DO APPRECIATE THAT ONE

00:58:01.477 --> 00:58:03.179
THING AYE I WAS JUST REMINDED OF

00:58:03.246 --> 00:58:04.414
THAT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TWO

00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:06.783
WHY BE DISTINCT ABOUT. AYE IS OF

00:58:06.850 --> 00:58:08.852
ON A MILITARY BASE SIDE. PERHAPS

00:58:08.918 --> 00:58:10.220
FOR THE REASONS WHY P. X. AND

00:58:10.286 --> 00:58:11.721
OTHER LOCATIONS ARE SO POPULAR

00:58:11.788 --> 00:58:12.956
IS BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE SALES

00:58:13.022 --> 00:58:14.757
TAX WHEN THEY'RE ON THAT FEDERAL

00:58:14.824 --> 00:58:15.959
FEDERAL MILITARY BASE.

00:58:16.025 --> 00:58:17.660
BOB BUT I THINK ANOTHER POINT

00:58:17.727 --> 00:58:19.495
I'D THAT WAS BROUGHT UP AYE IS

00:58:19.562 --> 00:58:20.330
VERY.

00:58:20.396 --> 00:58:23.466
WORTH EXPLORING I IN TERMS OF

00:58:23.533 --> 00:58:24.701
POTENTIALLY THE.

00:58:24.767 --> 00:58:27.136
THE OVERALL APPROACH TO THIS

00:58:27.203 --> 00:58:28.638
ISSUE AND THAT'S THAT TWENTY

00:58:28.705 --> 00:58:30.406
YEARS AGO THE LEGISLATURE

00:58:30.473 --> 00:58:32.208
ACTUALLY WAS ASKED TO PASS A

00:58:32.275 --> 00:58:34.143
BILL. A TO GRANT THE CITY

00:58:34.210 --> 00:58:36.579
COALINGA SPECIAL PERMISSION.

00:58:36.646 --> 00:58:39.215
ANNEX IN NONCONTIGUOUS PARCEL OF

00:58:39.282 --> 00:58:40.383
LAND THAT INCLUDED THE STATE

00:58:40.450 --> 00:58:42.318
PRISON AYE EVEN THOUGH IT WAS

00:58:42.385 --> 00:58:44.954
FOUR MILES AWAY. IN ORDER TO

00:58:45.021 --> 00:58:47.123
PERHAPS BOOST OUR THE POPULATION

00:58:47.190 --> 00:58:48.725
COUNT FOR THE CITY.

00:58:48.791 --> 00:58:50.593
AND THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR ANALYSIS

00:58:50.660 --> 00:58:52.395
UP FOR THAT BILL EXPLAIN. EITHER

00:58:52.462 --> 00:58:53.863
A PORTION OF BOTH THE VEHICLE

00:58:53.930 --> 00:58:55.865
LICENSE FUND FEES AND THE

00:58:55.932 --> 00:58:58.167
VEHICLE FUEL TAXES ARE ALLOCATED

00:58:58.234 --> 00:59:01.037
TO CITIES ON A PER CAPITA BASIS.

00:59:01.104 --> 00:59:02.438
AND BY ANNEXING STATE

00:59:02.505 --> 00:59:03.873
CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES AND

00:59:03.940 --> 00:59:05.208
THEREBY BRINGING PRISON

00:59:05.275 --> 00:59:07.510
RESIDENTS UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF

00:59:07.577 --> 00:59:09.178
THE CITY'S LOCAL POPULATION.

00:59:09.245 --> 00:59:10.813
THE CITY WOULD BE ENTITLED TO A

00:59:10.880 --> 00:59:12.482
LARGER PORTION OF THESE

00:59:12.548 --> 00:59:14.250
SUBVENTION. AND THAT'S SOMETHING

00:59:14.317 --> 00:59:15.852
THAT I WAS VERY INVOLVED IN WHEN

00:59:15.919 --> 00:59:17.587
I WORKED OU FOR THE COUNTY OF

00:59:17.654 --> 00:59:18.988
ORANGE AND SAW HOW. ORANGE

00:59:19.055 --> 00:59:20.657
COUNTY PUBLIC WORKS BENEFITTED

00:59:20.723 --> 00:59:21.491
FROM.

00:59:21.557 --> 00:59:23.493
THE POPULATION NOW THAT THEY

00:59:23.559 --> 00:59:25.295
HAD AND HOW INDIVIDUAL CITIES

00:59:25.361 --> 00:59:26.329
BENEFITTED FROM THE BAR

00:59:26.396 --> 00:59:28.631
POPULATION THEY HAD SU COALINGA.

00:59:28.698 --> 00:59:30.300
HAS BENEFITED FINANCIALLY FOR

00:59:30.366 --> 00:59:32.602
LAST TWENTY YEARS FROM BEING

00:59:32.669 --> 00:59:34.804
ABLE TO COUNT PRISONERS AT THE

00:59:34.871 --> 00:59:36.372
PLEASANT VALLEY STATE PRISON.

00:59:36.439 --> 00:59:37.840
AND PATIENTS FROM THE COALINGA

00:59:37.907 --> 00:59:40.376
STATE A STATE HOSPITAL IN THEIR

00:59:40.443 --> 00:59:41.744
POPULATION COUNT.

00:59:41.811 --> 00:59:44.380
HAVING RECEIVED THE FINANCIAL

00:59:44.447 --> 00:59:45.214
BENEFITS OF COUNTING VOTERS AT

00:59:45.281 --> 00:59:46.616
THE HOT.

00:59:46.683 --> 00:59:48.184
WHY SHOULD THE CITY NOW BE

00:59:48.251 --> 00:59:49.085
ALLOWED TO TREAT THEM AS NON

00:59:49.152 --> 00:59:50.486
RESIDENTS

00:59:50.553 --> 00:59:52.088
WITHOUT VOTING RIGHTS AYE IN

00:59:52.155 --> 00:59:54.290
TAKE THEM OFF THE VOTER ROLLS

00:59:54.357 --> 00:59:56.025
AND TRANSFORM TO OTHER LOCATIONS

00:59:56.092 --> 00:59:57.593
THROUGHOUT THE STATE? I JUST

00:59:57.660 --> 00:59:59.362
BECAUSE OF POLITICAL LEADERSHIP

00:59:59.429 --> 01:00:00.730
BUT DOES NOT LIKE HOW THEY VOTED

01:00:00.797 --> 01:00:02.031
ON A MEASURE.

01:00:02.098 --> 01:00:03.466
WELL THINK THAT'S AN APPROPRIATE

01:00:03.533 --> 01:00:04.701
QUESTION BOMBS.

01:00:04.767 --> 01:00:07.003
IF WE'RE LOOKING AT A TIME LINE

01:00:07.070 --> 01:00:08.137
THOUGH I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO

01:00:08.204 --> 01:00:09.539
RECOGNIZE THAT THE STATE

01:00:09.605 --> 01:00:10.606
HOSPITAL WAS NOT PRESENT WHEN

01:00:10.673 --> 01:00:12.575
THAT ANNEXATION HAPPENED.

01:00:12.642 --> 01:00:14.777
AND SO NOR WORD THE VOTING

01:00:14.844 --> 01:00:16.112
RIGHTS RESTORED UNTIL THE

01:00:16.179 --> 01:00:17.880
SUPERIOR COURT HAD RESTORED THEM

01:00:17.947 --> 01:00:19.515
IN TWENTY FOURTEEN.

01:00:19.582 --> 01:00:20.683
SO WE HAVE TWO VARIABLES THAT

01:00:20.750 --> 01:00:21.184
HAVE CHANGED SINCE THAT

01:00:21.250 --> 01:00:22.819
ANNEXATION.

01:00:22.885 --> 01:00:24.721
THE SECOND AND MORE PRESSING

01:00:24.787 --> 01:00:27.156
CONCERN IN TERMS OF THE CITY WAS

01:00:27.223 --> 01:00:28.157
STARING WITH THEIR FINANCIAL

01:00:28.224 --> 01:00:29.559
SHORTFALLS.

01:00:29.625 --> 01:00:31.260
HOW DO WE ADDRESS THE ISSUE

01:00:31.327 --> 01:00:32.695
THAT'S BEFORE US AND THEY WERE

01:00:32.762 --> 01:00:34.630
TRYING TO DEAL WITH THIS?

01:00:34.697 --> 01:00:36.799
NOW WHETHER THE CITY SHOULD ON

01:00:36.866 --> 01:00:39.335
AN AXE ISN'T DECISION THAT THE

01:00:39.402 --> 01:00:41.204
LOCALS CAN MAKE.

01:00:41.270 --> 01:00:43.439
WHAT? I WANT TO SAY IS THAT NONE

01:00:43.506 --> 01:00:44.474
OF THAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IN

01:00:44.540 --> 01:00:46.009
THE TIMELINE THAT WOULD HAVE

01:00:46.075 --> 01:00:47.610
BEEN ABLE TO KEEP THE POLICE

01:00:47.677 --> 01:00:49.312
OFFICERS AND FIREFIGHTERS. THAT

01:00:49.379 --> 01:00:50.780
WERE NEEDED FOR THE CITY THAT

01:00:50.847 --> 01:00:51.948
THE TIMELINE FOR THE ON

01:00:52.015 --> 01:00:53.916
ANNEXATION IF THAT WAS A CHOICE

01:00:53.983 --> 01:00:56.085
THEY WISH TO PURSUE. A WOULD NOT

01:00:56.152 --> 01:00:56.986
HAVE ALLOWED THEM TO RETAIN

01:00:57.053 --> 01:00:57.720
THOSE OFFICERS.

01:00:57.787 --> 01:01:00.189
AND.

01:01:00.256 --> 01:01:01.891
MISTER MERITED YOUR I ABSOLUTELY

01:01:01.958 --> 01:01:04.761
DID I'M I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT.

01:01:04.827 --> 01:01:05.294
YOU CAN LOOK AT THINGS AS

01:01:05.361 --> 01:01:05.561
BENEFITS.

01:01:05.628 --> 01:01:07.330
BUT

01:01:07.397 --> 01:01:09.232
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF

01:01:09.298 --> 01:01:10.733
PUBLIC SAFETY THAT'S REQUIRED

01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:12.502
WHEN YOU HAVE A STATE HOSPITAL

01:01:12.568 --> 01:01:14.003
AND YOU HAVE THE RELATIVES GUY

01:01:14.070 --> 01:01:16.072
COMING YOU HAVE A PRISON. AND

01:01:16.139 --> 01:01:18.174
YOU HAVE THE RELATIVES COMING

01:01:18.241 --> 01:01:18.708
AND A LOT OF OUR COMMUNITY

01:01:18.775 --> 01:01:19.976
STATED.

01:01:20.043 --> 01:01:21.244
WE DIDN'T WANT THE EITHER OF

01:01:21.310 --> 01:01:22.979
THESE INSTITUTIONS COMING

01:01:23.046 --> 01:01:23.846
BECAUSE OF THE UNINTENDED

01:01:23.913 --> 01:01:25.848
CONSEQUENCES THAT COME.

01:01:25.915 --> 01:01:27.183
I JUST CHECK WE GET ABOUT TWELVE

01:01:27.250 --> 01:01:28.985
THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR FROM

01:01:29.052 --> 01:01:31.320
THOSE GOT GAS TAXES AND STUFF

01:01:31.387 --> 01:01:32.455
LIKE THAT TO COME THROUGH THERE.

01:01:32.522 --> 01:01:34.690
UP I WOULD GIVE THAT MONEY UP IN

01:01:34.757 --> 01:01:35.992
A HEARTBEAT EVEN THOUGH THAT

01:01:36.059 --> 01:01:36.325
WERE NOT TOM.

01:01:36.392 --> 01:01:38.261
.

01:01:38.327 --> 01:01:39.896
THIS MY PERSONAL OPINION EVEN

01:01:39.962 --> 01:01:41.397
THOUGH THAT WE ARE ARE HORRIBLE

01:01:41.464 --> 01:01:43.866
POSITION TECH DEBT WISE BUT IF

01:01:43.933 --> 01:01:45.935
IT'S THE RECOMMENDATION OF THIS

01:01:46.002 --> 01:01:47.870
COMMITTEE TO ARM.

01:01:47.937 --> 01:01:50.373
YOU KNOW DE ANNEX THAT AREA.

01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:51.574
I WOULD SAY THAT THAT'S AKIN TO

01:01:51.641 --> 01:01:53.209
GERRYMANDERING ON OUR SIDE IF WE

01:01:53.276 --> 01:01:54.744
WERE TO DO THAT WE WOULD BE IN

01:01:54.811 --> 01:01:56.179
THE EXACT SAME BOAT YOU DO LOOK

01:01:56.245 --> 01:01:57.947
AT US AND SAYING SAYING. HEY WHY

01:01:58.014 --> 01:01:58.781
ARE YOU TRYING TO CUT THESE

01:01:58.848 --> 01:01:59.949
PEOPLE OUT SO WE'RE NOT GONNA

01:02:00.016 --> 01:02:01.584
BUILD A WIN FOR LOSING. AND AND

01:02:01.651 --> 01:02:02.885
HERE'S ANOTHER THING THAT OUT

01:02:02.952 --> 01:02:04.654
BUT I WOULD STATE ABOUT.

01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:05.855
THE STATE HOSPITAL BEING OUT

01:02:05.922 --> 01:02:07.623
THERE IS THAT AS YOU EVERYONE'S

01:02:07.690 --> 01:02:09.425
HAS STATED ALREADY YOU KNOW WE

01:02:09.492 --> 01:02:11.194
TOOK THAT SONG HALF OF OUR

01:02:11.260 --> 01:02:12.662
CITIZENS I BELIEVE DIDN'T WANT

01:02:12.728 --> 01:02:14.397
THAT SCENARIO. UP THE STATE

01:02:14.464 --> 01:02:16.265
HOSPITAL GETS A TON OF ITS WATER

01:02:16.332 --> 01:02:17.600
ALL OF ITS WATER FROM CITY

01:02:17.667 --> 01:02:19.235
KALANGA WHAT HAPPENS IF THEY'RE

01:02:19.302 --> 01:02:20.803
NO LONGER IN THE CITY. WHERE

01:02:20.870 --> 01:02:21.971
THEY GET THEIR WATER RINSE WHEN

01:02:22.038 --> 01:02:23.039
THE WHEN THE STATE COMES AND

01:02:23.106 --> 01:02:24.607
SAYS HEY WE NEED TO CUT OUT

01:02:24.674 --> 01:02:25.975
WATER FUNDS WE NEED TO TAKE OUT

01:02:26.042 --> 01:02:27.410
THE DAY REFERRED TO DROUGHT? YOU

01:02:27.477 --> 01:02:28.578
KNOW THAT ARE OUTLINED

01:02:28.644 --> 01:02:29.612
BUSINESSES IN AREAS WERE THE

01:02:29.679 --> 01:02:32.048
FIRST PEOPLE THAT WERE CUT OFF

01:02:32.115 --> 01:02:32.648
WHERE THEY'RE GONNA GET THEIR

01:02:32.715 --> 01:02:32.949
WATER FROM.

01:02:33.015 --> 01:02:34.083
THAT'S GONNA BE ANOTHER BIG

01:02:34.150 --> 01:02:35.818
SCENARIO I THINK THE CITY AND

01:02:35.885 --> 01:02:37.153
THE CITIZENS WOULD DEFINITELY BE

01:02:37.220 --> 01:02:39.956
INTO DE ANNEXING THAT AREA A

01:02:40.022 --> 01:02:41.491
LISTENING TO OUR CITIZENS AROUND

01:02:41.557 --> 01:02:42.692
THAT WOULD BE THAT COULD BE AN

01:02:42.758 --> 01:02:44.894
OPTION HOWEVER. I THINK THAT.

01:02:44.961 --> 01:02:46.562
WE WOULD LIKE YOU KNOW SOME

01:02:46.629 --> 01:02:48.865
KIND OF A DIRECTION TO DO THAT

01:02:48.931 --> 01:02:50.399
BECAUSE OF THAT WAS GIVEN TO US.

01:02:50.466 --> 01:02:51.234
THEN IT WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO COME

01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:52.602
BACK AROUND AND SAY THAT WE'RE

01:02:52.668 --> 01:02:54.437
GERRYMANDERING THE SITUATION AND

01:02:54.504 --> 01:02:55.838
I THINK THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT

01:02:55.905 --> 01:02:57.073
PATIENTS THAT ARE OUT THERE

01:02:57.140 --> 01:02:58.975
ACTUALLY DO BENEFIT. FROM THE

01:02:59.041 --> 01:03:00.076
SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE THAT

01:03:00.143 --> 01:03:01.777
WE'RE NO LONGER GOING TO BE ABLE

01:03:01.844 --> 01:03:02.245
TO PROVIDE.

01:03:02.311 --> 01:03:04.147
BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT OUR

01:03:04.213 --> 01:03:05.681
TAX IS SPELLED IN BECAUSE OF THE

01:03:05.748 --> 01:03:07.917
TAX THAT THE FACT THAT THE STATE

01:03:07.984 --> 01:03:08.684
DECIDED NOT TO.

01:03:08.751 --> 01:03:11.420
DO AT THE HOSPITAL ANYMORE OUR

01:03:11.487 --> 01:03:12.722
CITIZENS BILL LIKE THAT WE'RE

01:03:12.788 --> 01:03:14.657
BOONDOGGLE AND US THEY SAID THEY

01:03:14.724 --> 01:03:15.291
WOULD HIRE SIXTY PERCENT OF THE

01:03:15.358 --> 01:03:16.893
PEOPLE THERE'S ABOUT THIRTY

01:03:16.959 --> 01:03:18.161
PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE. THEY SAID

01:03:18.227 --> 01:03:19.562
THE PEOPLE COME TO LIVE HERE VAN

01:03:19.629 --> 01:03:21.564
POOLS BY TAX BONDS ARE TAKING

01:03:21.631 --> 01:03:23.232
PEOPLE AWAY FROM OUR COMMUNITY.

01:03:23.299 --> 01:03:24.834
THIS IS NOT BEEN A BENEFIT TO

01:03:24.901 --> 01:03:26.302
OUR COMMUNITY I JUST ONE POINT

01:03:26.369 --> 01:03:27.303
THAT OUT I DON'T WANT ANYONE

01:03:27.370 --> 01:03:28.638
THINKING OF THIS A BENEFIT THIS

01:03:28.704 --> 01:03:30.439
IS NOT A BENEFIT EXCEPT FOR THE

01:03:30.506 --> 01:03:31.908
JOBS. AND THE OPPORTUNITIES FROM

01:03:31.974 --> 01:03:33.042
THAT BUT GETS WET WHEN THIRTY

01:03:33.109 --> 01:03:34.177
PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE ARE ONLY

01:03:34.243 --> 01:03:36.045
WORKING LOCAL AND THE REMAINDER

01:03:36.112 --> 01:03:38.147
OF THEM ARE WORKING ELSEWHERE.

01:03:38.214 --> 01:03:39.482
THAT'S NOT SUCH A BIG BENEFIT

01:03:39.549 --> 01:03:40.683
AND I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO POINT

01:03:40.750 --> 01:03:41.684
OUT THAT EVERYONE THAT WORKS

01:03:41.751 --> 01:03:43.119
THERE PAYS THAT SALES TAX

01:03:43.186 --> 01:03:44.287
EVERYONE THAT COMES THROUGH

01:03:44.353 --> 01:03:46.355
KALANGA PAYS THAT SELLS TAX. SO

01:03:46.422 --> 01:03:47.156
IT'S NOT TAXATION WITHOUT

01:03:47.223 --> 01:03:48.791
REPRESENTATION AND A LOT OF

01:03:48.858 --> 01:03:50.526
THESE PEOPLE THAT WERE OUT THERE

01:03:50.593 --> 01:03:51.627
ACTUALLY THERE WERE THERE IN

01:03:51.694 --> 01:03:54.897
LIEU. OF A SENTENCE

01:03:54.964 --> 01:03:55.565
THING I LIKE THAT THEY ACTUALLY

01:03:55.631 --> 01:03:56.499
FINISH THEIR STUFF SO THANK YOU

01:03:56.566 --> 01:03:57.967
VERY MUCH.

01:03:58.034 --> 01:03:59.769
SO MISS CHAIRED THAT THE LAST

01:03:59.835 --> 01:04:00.303
THING THAT I WANTED TO TO

01:04:00.369 --> 01:04:01.270
MENTION.

01:04:01.337 --> 01:04:03.105
I DON'T THINK THE COMMITTEE

01:04:03.172 --> 01:04:04.173
WOULD REALLY BE IN A POSITION TO

01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:05.408
MAKE YOU A SUGGESTION

01:04:05.474 --> 01:04:06.609
SUGGESTIONS ARE DIRECTIONS BUT I

01:04:06.676 --> 01:04:07.910
CAN MAKE.

01:04:07.977 --> 01:04:10.112
SUGGESTIONS ONE IS ARE THIS

01:04:10.179 --> 01:04:12.381
ELECTION THAT'S IN CONCERN WAS A

01:04:12.448 --> 01:04:14.050
SPECIAL ELECTION IN AN ODD YEAR.

01:04:14.116 --> 01:04:16.419
I OBVIOUSLY HAD VERY LOW TURNOUT

01:04:16.485 --> 01:04:17.753
EXCEPT FOR ONE PARTICULAR

01:04:17.820 --> 01:04:19.288
COMMUNITY THAT SEEM TO HAVE OVER

01:04:19.355 --> 01:04:21.257
FIFTY FIVE PERCENT TURNOUT WHICH

01:04:21.324 --> 01:04:22.058
WAS THE FOLKS AT THE STATE

01:04:22.124 --> 01:04:23.526
HOSPITAL.

01:04:23.593 --> 01:04:25.061
I STILL HOLDING THE ELECTION

01:04:25.127 --> 01:04:26.963
AGAIN IN PERHAPS A REGULAR

01:04:27.029 --> 01:04:28.497
GENERAL ELECTION OR REGULAR

01:04:28.564 --> 01:04:30.132
PRIMARY ELECTION.

01:04:30.199 --> 01:04:32.001
WOULD ACTUALLY HAVE A BROADER

01:04:32.068 --> 01:04:34.203
RANGE OF PARTICIPATION BY THE

01:04:34.270 --> 01:04:35.504
PEOPLE OF CALLING AND I THINK

01:04:35.571 --> 01:04:37.306
THAT THAT PROBABLY OUGHT TO BE.

01:04:37.373 --> 01:04:39.008
THE FIRST PATH I'VE FOR THE

01:04:39.075 --> 01:04:40.476
CITY TO LOOK AT IT COULD HAVE

01:04:40.543 --> 01:04:41.544
BEEN JUNE FIFTH BUT THEY WERE

01:04:41.611 --> 01:04:42.578
TOO LATE FOR THE DEADLINES ON

01:04:42.645 --> 01:04:44.013
THAT BUT OF COURSE NOVEMBER SIX

01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:45.514
IS AN OPPORTUNITY.

01:04:45.581 --> 01:04:47.783
I THEIR QUESTIONS WERE BROUGHT

01:04:47.850 --> 01:04:48.551
UP IN TERMS OF.

01:04:48.618 --> 01:04:49.885
THE LAW ON THE DOMICILE

01:04:49.952 --> 01:04:51.887
QUESTION I IN WHAT REALLY

01:04:51.954 --> 01:04:53.522
CONSTITUTES ADONIS OUT THAT

01:04:53.589 --> 01:04:54.757
SOUNDS LIKE A QUESTION FOR THE

01:04:54.824 --> 01:04:56.225
COURTS AND THE QUESTION I FOR

01:04:56.292 --> 01:04:58.261
POTENTIAL LITIGATION BY THE CITY.

01:04:58.327 --> 01:04:59.862
OUGHT TO SETTLE THAT ISSUE WHICH

01:04:59.929 --> 01:05:01.430
WOULDN'T NEED ACTION BY BY THE

01:05:01.497 --> 01:05:03.032
STATE LEGISLATURE

01:05:03.099 --> 01:05:04.267
I NO WOULDN'T BE POPULAR WITH

01:05:04.333 --> 01:05:05.368
THE MAJORITY.

01:05:05.434 --> 01:05:07.370
WITHIN THIS BODY BUT MAYBE

01:05:07.436 --> 01:05:09.538
HAVING A DISCUSSION OF.

01:05:09.605 --> 01:05:10.873
IS IT APPROPRIATE TO HAVE A

01:05:10.940 --> 01:05:12.408
VOTING RIGHTS FOR.

01:05:12.475 --> 01:05:13.643
FELONS.

01:05:13.709 --> 01:05:15.444
WHO ARE SEXUALLY VIOLENT

01:05:15.511 --> 01:05:17.113
PREDATORS EVEN AFTER THEIR?

01:05:17.179 --> 01:05:18.748
THEIR SENTENCES AYE IS A TIME

01:05:18.814 --> 01:05:20.082
FOR THAT KIND OF DISCUSSION BUT

01:05:20.149 --> 01:05:21.751
I THINK THAT ALSO ONE OF THINGS

01:05:21.817 --> 01:05:23.319
THAT WAS BROUGHT UP AND I'M GLAD

01:05:23.386 --> 01:05:25.288
PEOPLE ARE ACT BY DISCUSSING

01:05:25.354 --> 01:05:27.523
THIS. IS IS IT APPROPRIATE.

01:05:27.590 --> 01:05:29.458
TO MOVE FORWARD WITH A DOZEN

01:05:29.525 --> 01:05:31.060
CORPORATION IF INDEED.

01:05:31.127 --> 01:05:33.529
THIS FACILITY ISN'T PART OF THE

01:05:33.596 --> 01:05:36.999
COMMUNITY I I WOULD. AGREE THAT.

01:05:37.066 --> 01:05:38.734
YOU YOU STILL HAVE A SITUATION

01:05:38.801 --> 01:05:40.069
OF IT'S NOT A PART OF THE CITY

01:05:40.136 --> 01:05:41.470
COALINGA IT'S A PART OF THE

01:05:41.537 --> 01:05:43.239
COUNTY THEY STILL BE REPRESENTED

01:05:43.306 --> 01:05:45.374
BY COUNTY SUPERVISORS SIX ATRA.

01:05:45.441 --> 01:05:46.442
IN TERMS OF THEIR LOCAL

01:05:46.509 --> 01:05:47.777
GOVERNMENT ESPECIALLY SINCE THIS

01:05:47.843 --> 01:05:50.680
PARCEL AYE IS NOT CONTIGUOUS OUT

01:05:50.746 --> 01:05:52.214
WITH THE REST OF THE CITY OF.

01:05:52.281 --> 01:05:54.383
OF COALINGA SO WITH THAT I

01:05:54.450 --> 01:05:55.651
THINK THAT THERE ARE OTHER

01:05:55.718 --> 01:05:56.986
POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS AND

BETTER CAMPAIGN.

01:08:47.323 --> 01:08:48.991
I DON'T THINK THEY UNDERSTOOD

01:08:49.058 --> 01:08:50.526
THAT VOTING RIGHTS HAVE BEEN

01:08:50.593 --> 01:08:51.660
RESTORED.

01:08:51.727 --> 01:08:52.962

01:09:13.949 --> 01:09:15.084
FOR THE SPECIAL ELECTION THAT

01:12:25.140 --> 01:12:25.774
ON.

01:12:25.841 --> 01:12:27.710
MAJOR ISSUES CELL.

LOOK AT THE POTENTIAL BYPRODUCTS

01:12:37.252 --> 01:12:41.190
OF WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE.

01:12:41.256 --> 01:12:41.490

REDISTRICTING AND THAT WAS

01:14:00.369 --> 01:14:02.037
REALLY A STEP SNAP IN TIME. BUT

01:14:02.104 --> 01:14:03.672
PROBABLY PEOPLE CHANGE SEVERE.

01:14:03.739 --> 01:14:05.407
.

01:14:05.474 --> 01:14:07.209

WHEREVER THEY CHOOSE TO VOTE

01:14:09.378 --> 01:14:11.380
MOST OF THE TIME. A I'M CEMENT

01:14:11.446 --> 01:14:12.681
MOST OF US HAVE HAD KIDS WHO GOT

01:14:12.748 --> 01:14:14.149
OFF TO COLLEGE.

01:14:14.216 --> 01:14:15.317
AND THE SIDE THAT THEY GONNA

01:14:15.384 --> 01:14:16.185
KEEP THEIR VOTING AT THEIR

01:14:16.251 --> 01:14:18.086
PARENTS HOUSE.

GERRYMANDER OUT OF A SITUATION

01:14:34.036 --> 01:14:35.003

OUTCOME OF THE VOTE.

01:14:36.471 --> 01:14:37.739

01:15:40.302 --> 01:15:43.138
PRECEDENT BAD PRECEDENT FOR THAT

01:15:43.205 --> 01:15:43.405
TO HAPPEN.

YOU THINK THIS IS YOU KNOW THIS

01:15:53.849 --> 01:15:55.250
IS NOT THE NATURE OF THE CITY

01:16:06.995 --> 01:16:08.463
DANGEROUS TO KIND OF WAIT INTO

01:16:08.530 --> 01:16:11.033
THIS GERRYMANDERING OF SITUATION.

01:16:11.099 --> 01:16:12.367

I REMEMBER THAT AT.

01:16:34.089 --> 01:16:35.590
WHEN THE PEOPLE AT THE HOSPITAL

01:16:35.657 --> 01:16:37.326
