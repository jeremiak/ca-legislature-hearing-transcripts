OVER THE LAST DECADE THE

GENERATING ARE. STEADILY

00:34:29.801 --> 00:34:32.136
DECLINING. AND THE REASON

00:34:32.203 --> 00:34:33.871
THEY'RE DECLINING IS WHAT WE

00:34:33.938 --> 00:34:36.240
LIKE TO CHARACTERIZE AS- US

00:34:36.307 --> 00:34:37.842
BEING VICTIMS OF OUR OWN SUCCESS

00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:39.644
THERE ARE TWO PRINCIPAL DRIVERS

00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:41.512
THE FIRST IS BEHIND THE METER

00:34:41.579 --> 00:34:45.116
GROWTH. IN SO WE'RE UP TO TWELVE

00:34:45.183 --> 00:34:46.617
GIGAWATTS NOW OF BEHIND THE

00:34:46.684 --> 00:34:49.454
METER CHIEFLY SOLAR SOME WIND UP

00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:50.588
SOME OF THE RESEARCH BUT IT'S

00:34:50.655 --> 00:34:53.157
BUT CHEAPLY SOURCE OR UP TO

00:34:53.224 --> 00:34:54.792
TWELVE TWELVE GIGAWATTS- VERY

00:34:54.859 --> 00:34:56.494
LARGE NUMBER. THE SECOND FACTOR

00:34:56.561 --> 00:34:58.129
IS CONSERVATION AND SO THE

00:34:58.196 --> 00:35:00.097
ENERGY COMMISSION ADOPTS I THINK

00:35:00.164 --> 00:35:02.066

IN AND NEWLY BUILT BUILDINGS OR

00:35:09.474 --> 00:35:12.243
MAJOR ADDITIONS. AND SECOND WE-

00:35:12.310 --> 00:35:13.811
ADOPT REGULATIONS THAT REGULATE

00:35:13.878 --> 00:35:14.979
THE MANNER IN WHICH OCT

00:35:15.046 --> 00:35:16.581
ELECTRONICS AND OTHER

00:35:16.647 --> 00:35:19.217
ELECTRICITY CONSUMING. PRODUCTS

00:35:19.283 --> 00:35:21.018
CONSUMER ELECTRICITY AND THE-

00:35:21.085 --> 00:35:22.653
APPROACHES TO IS TO REDUCE THEM

00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:23.654
THROUGH THROUGH ABOUT

00:35:23.721 --> 00:35:25.923
TECHNOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENTS.

00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:27.925
THESE TWO FACTORS TOGETHER. HAVE

00:35:27.992 --> 00:35:30.795
BEEN CONSPIRING TO REDUCE THE

00:35:30.862 --> 00:35:32.163
AMOUNT OF METERED ELECTRICITY

00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:33.664
WHICH IS GREAT FOR CALIFORNIA

00:35:33.731 --> 00:35:36.400
pBUT IT'S BEEN NOT SO GREAT FOR

00:35:36.467 --> 00:35:37.702
THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY

00:35:37.768 --> 00:35:39.003
COMMISSION'S BUDGET. AND SO JUST

00:35:39.070 --> 00:35:41.005
GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE THE- THAT

00:35:41.072 --> 00:35:43.040
THE TELEVISION- PLANTS

00:35:43.107 --> 00:35:45.076
REGULATIONS WE ADOPTED SOME

00:35:45.142 --> 00:35:47.979
YEARS AGO- WE ESTIMATE SAVE EACH

00:35:48.045 --> 00:35:50.014
CONSUMER ABOUT FIFTY FIVE

00:35:50.081 --> 00:35:51.983
DOLLARS PER YEAR PER TELEVISION

00:35:52.049 --> 00:35:53.651
SO THE MODEST INCREASE IN THE

00:35:53.718 --> 00:35:55.553
COST OF THE TELEVISION BORN. ARE

00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:57.221
CAUSED BY THE IT THAT THE

00:35:57.288 --> 00:35:58.422
CHANGES THAT NEED TO BE MADE IN

00:35:58.489 --> 00:36:00.258
THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS GET

00:36:00.324 --> 00:36:02.326
PAID FOR VERY VERY QUICKLY IN IN

00:36:02.393 --> 00:36:03.528
A DECADE WHICH IS WHAT WE

00:36:03.594 --> 00:36:05.062
ESTIMATE THE AVERAGE TV'S LIFE

00:36:05.129 --> 00:36:06.664
IS THE CONSUMER GETS BACK FIVE

00:36:06.731 --> 00:36:07.765
FIFTY DOLLARS. THAT'S ONE

00:36:07.832 --> 00:36:09.534
EXAMPLE TO PRETTY PRETTY GOOD

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:10.468
ONE THERE'S OTHERS WITH BATTERY

00:36:10.535 --> 00:36:12.670
CHARGERS WITH COMPUTERS AND SO

00:36:12.737 --> 00:36:13.971
FORTH BUT AGAIN THESE TWO

00:36:14.038 --> 00:36:14.972
FACTORS BEHIND THE METER

00:36:15.039 --> 00:36:16.874
CONSUMPTION THAT DOESN'T GET.

00:36:16.941 --> 00:36:18.276
THE URBAN CHARGE APPLIED TO IT

00:36:18.342 --> 00:36:21.245
AND CONSERVATION HAVE DEPRESSED

00:36:21.312 --> 00:36:22.880
THE OB. ROSS THE REVENUES FOR

00:36:22.947 --> 00:36:25.249
CALIFORNIA. SO THAT IS OUR

00:36:25.316 --> 00:36:26.617
STRUCTURAL DEFICIT SO WHAT WE'RE

00:36:26.684 --> 00:36:31.656
PROPOSING- IS TO- MAKE MAKE

00:36:31.722 --> 00:36:33.591
THREE CHANGES AND BY THE WAY WE

00:36:33.658 --> 00:36:35.026
HAVE WE HAVE OVER THE YEARS

00:36:35.092 --> 00:36:36.260
WORKED VERY HARD TO REDUCE

00:36:36.327 --> 00:36:37.595
EXPENDITURES WE'VE SHIFTED THE

00:36:37.662 --> 00:36:39.363
LAST SEVERAL BUDGET CYCLES

00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:40.164
THIRTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS.

00:36:40.231 --> 00:36:42.667
OFF OF HER BY. ABOUT TWENTY OF

00:36:42.733 --> 00:36:45.469
THAT IS- SHIFTS TO OTHER FUNDS

00:36:45.536 --> 00:36:48.139
ABOUT SIXTEEN OF IT IS SIXTEEN

00:36:48.205 --> 00:36:49.907
TO SEVENTEEN OF IT IS ACTUAL.

00:36:49.974 --> 00:36:51.409
REAL CUTS AND- JUSTGIVING A

00:36:51.475 --> 00:36:52.810
FAIRLY RECENT EXAMPLE WE MOVED

00:36:52.877 --> 00:36:56.981
TO A NEW. FLOOR SPACE AND WE ARE

00:36:57.048 --> 00:36:58.349
SAVING OVER A MILLION DOLLARS A

00:36:58.416 --> 00:37:01.485
YEAR READ. WE ALSO- JUST AFTER

00:37:01.552 --> 00:37:02.553
THE PANDEMIC A COUPLE MONTHS

00:37:02.620 --> 00:37:05.222
AFTER MARCH TWENTY TWENTY I GOT

00:37:05.289 --> 00:37:07.358
RID OF ALL OF OUR LAND LINES AND

00:37:07.425 --> 00:37:09.126
BOUGHT UP SELF OF THE FLIP

00:37:09.193 --> 00:37:10.761
PHONES BASICALLY FOR ALL OF OUR

00:37:10.828 --> 00:37:12.730
STAFF. AND THE NET IS ABOUT A

00:37:12.797 --> 00:37:14.231
TWO HUNDRED AND LITTLE OVER TWO

00:37:14.298 --> 00:37:15.333
HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS PER

00:37:15.399 --> 00:37:16.500
YEAR SAVINGS AS A CONSEQUENCE OF

00:37:16.567 --> 00:37:18.169
NOT HAVING LIMITS ANYMORE. SO

00:37:18.235 --> 00:37:19.403
WE'RE VERY FRUGAL WE TRY TO

00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:21.138
MANAGE YOUR MONEY VERY CAREFULLY

00:37:21.205 --> 00:37:21.739
NEVERTHELESS WE'RE WE'RE STUCK

00:37:21.806 --> 00:37:23.874
IN THIS POSITION SO WE HAVE A

00:37:23.941 --> 00:37:25.142
PROPOSAL THAT HAS THREE PARTS

00:37:25.209 --> 00:37:26.410
THE FIRST. IS TO RAISE THE

00:37:26.477 --> 00:37:27.645
STATUTORY CAPS RIGHT NOW THIS

00:37:27.712 --> 00:37:29.347
THE CAP IS AT THREE TENTHS OF

00:37:29.413 --> 00:37:32.984
THE MIDDLE SO POINT ZERO ZERO

00:37:33.050 --> 00:37:34.218
ZERO THREE. CENTS PER KILOWATT

00:37:34.285 --> 00:37:37.888
HOUR CONSUMED BY CONSUMERS. AND

00:37:37.955 --> 00:37:39.256
WILL PROPOSE RAISING THAT TO

00:37:39.323 --> 00:37:43.060
POINT ZERO ZERO ZERO FIVE FIVE.

00:37:43.127 --> 00:37:44.061
IN THE WAY THE STATUTORY

00:37:44.128 --> 00:37:45.096
MECHANISM WORKS IS EVERY

00:37:45.162 --> 00:37:46.831
NOVEMBER THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY

00:37:46.897 --> 00:37:48.666
COMMISSION IS EMPOWERED TO

00:37:48.733 --> 00:37:50.868
ADJUST THAT RATE COULD BE UP IT

00:37:50.935 --> 00:37:51.636
COULD BE DOWN- IT'S DONE IN A

00:37:51.702 --> 00:37:53.304
PUBLIC MEETING AND WE'VE DONE IT

00:37:53.371 --> 00:37:55.606
A COUPLE TIMES OVER THE YEARS.

00:37:55.673 --> 00:37:56.307
WHICH HAS RAISED THAT LEVEL THAT

00:37:56.374 --> 00:37:57.708
WE'RE AT RIGHT NOW TO THE

00:37:57.775 --> 00:37:59.243
STATUTORY CAP SO THAT'S ONE

00:37:59.310 --> 00:38:02.380
INCREASE THE CAP. THE SECOND IS

00:38:02.446 --> 00:38:04.315
TO TAX TAG THAT CAP TO

00:38:04.382 --> 00:38:06.384
INFLATION. THE SENATE COMMISSION

00:38:06.450 --> 00:38:07.451
REPORT BY THE SENATE OFFICE OF

00:38:07.518 --> 00:38:09.053
RESEARCH THAT FOUND THAT HAD

00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:10.154
THAT HAPPENED BACK IN THE

00:38:10.221 --> 00:38:11.522
SEVENTIES WHEN WE WERE CREATED.

00:38:11.589 --> 00:38:13.357
WE WOULD ABOUT ABOUT POINT FIVE

00:38:13.424 --> 00:38:15.626
FIVE POINT ZERO ZERO ZERO FIVE

00:38:15.693 --> 00:38:17.128
FIVE NOW- SO WE THINK TO AVOID

00:38:17.194 --> 00:38:18.763
COMING IN HERE AGAIN IN THE

00:38:18.829 --> 00:38:20.364
FUTURE THIS IS A SENSIBLE SECOND

00:38:20.431 --> 00:38:21.899
MOVE AND THEN FINALLY. BECAUSE

00:38:21.966 --> 00:38:23.868
BEHIND THE METER TODAY UP TILL

00:38:23.934 --> 00:38:26.570
TODAY HAS NOT BEEN. CONTRIBUTING

00:38:26.637 --> 00:38:28.873
TO THE- BUT SURCHARGE WE ARE

00:38:28.939 --> 00:38:30.274
RECOMMENDING THE BUDGET THAT THE

00:38:30.341 --> 00:38:31.676
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET RECOMMENDS

00:38:31.742 --> 00:38:33.277
THAT WE- INCLUDE BEHIND THE

00:38:33.344 --> 00:38:36.547
METER- IN IN THE CALCULATION.

00:38:36.614 --> 00:38:39.116
INTERESTING WHAT THIS MEANS IN

00:38:39.183 --> 00:38:40.284
REAL DOLLARS. THE BUT I

00:38:40.351 --> 00:38:42.853
SURCHARGE GENERATES ABOUT SIXTY

00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:43.487
NINE SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS PER

00:38:43.554 --> 00:38:46.691
YEAR LATELY. AND THAT TRANSLATES

00:38:46.757 --> 00:38:50.494
INTO A HEAP AND APPROXIMATELY

00:38:50.561 --> 00:38:52.963
EIGHTEEN CENTS. PER MONTH PER. A

00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:55.866
PAIR. IF THAT'S THE THAT THAT'S

00:38:55.933 --> 00:38:57.902
AVERAGE IF YOU'RE MAJOR RIGHT-

00:38:57.968 --> 00:38:59.236
MAJOR CONSUMER OF ELECTRICITY

00:38:59.303 --> 00:39:00.304
YOUR FIGURES GONNA BE

00:39:00.371 --> 00:39:01.605
SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER BUT BUT

00:39:01.672 --> 00:39:03.140
THAT'S THE AVERAGE ACROSS ALL

00:39:03.207 --> 00:39:05.443
OUR CLASSES SO CLOSING WE THINK

00:39:05.509 --> 00:39:06.877
THIS IS AN EXCELLENT INVESTMENT

00:39:06.944 --> 00:39:09.780
FOR CALIFORNIA WE ARE NOT AWARE

00:39:09.847 --> 00:39:11.215
OF TOO MANY STATE AGENCIES THAT

00:39:11.282 --> 00:39:12.616
CAN SAY THE INVESTMENTS IN WHAT

00:39:12.683 --> 00:39:15.019
WE DO RETURN ACTUAL MONEY TO

00:39:15.086 --> 00:39:16.187
THOSE WHO ARE MAKING THE

00:39:16.253 --> 00:39:17.288
INVESTMENTS NAMELY THAT THE RATE

00:39:17.354 --> 00:39:19.190
PAYERS IN CALIFORNIA BY VIRTUE

00:39:19.256 --> 00:39:21.826
OF THE CONSERVATION I DESCRIBED-

00:39:21.892 --> 00:39:24.462
AND S WE THINK THIS IS A SOUND

00:39:24.528 --> 00:39:26.464
INVESTMENT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH

00:39:26.530 --> 00:39:28.132
. THANK YOU- WE HAVE SOME

00:39:28.199 --> 00:39:29.400
QUESTIONS FOR YOU BUT FIRST I

00:39:29.467 --> 00:39:30.735
SHOULD OBSERVE THAT I THINK THAT

00:39:30.801 --> 00:39:33.637
THE US CPI- INCREASE THAT YOU'RE

00:39:33.704 --> 00:39:36.006
PROPOSING IS MUSIC TO ASSEMBLY

00:39:36.073 --> 00:39:38.676
MEMBER BENEFITS- ERRORS BECAUSE

00:39:38.743 --> 00:39:39.443
THAT'S SOMETHING HE'S BEEN

00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:43.481
PUSHING FOR A- ALL YEAR- LET'S

00:39:43.547 --> 00:39:46.183
SAY HRE FROM- THE- DEPARTMENT

00:39:46.250 --> 00:39:47.785
OF FINANCE AND THEN THE OHIO

00:39:47.852 --> 00:39:49.420
PLEASE. YEAH I THINK. IMMA NOW

00:39:49.487 --> 00:39:51.555
BEEN DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- THE-

00:39:51.622 --> 00:39:52.623
BUT SHE'D BE OUT REALLY A

00:39:52.690 --> 00:39:53.724
PROPOSED SOLUTION TO A

00:39:53.791 --> 00:39:55.025
STRUCTURAL DEFICIT WITHIN THIS

00:39:55.092 --> 00:39:56.360
FUND THAT'S EXISTED FOR A FAIR

00:39:56.427 --> 00:39:58.362
AMOUNT OF YEARS NOW THAT WE'VE

00:39:58.429 --> 00:40:00.264
RETURNED- I THINK. FOR AS LONG

00:40:00.331 --> 00:40:02.366
AS I'VE BEEN AT FINANCE- SO WERE

00:40:02.433 --> 00:40:03.367
QUESTIONING THIS THROUGH THE

00:40:03.434 --> 00:40:05.836
BUDGET- AND I THINK THE CHAIRS

00:40:05.903 --> 00:40:09.273
ARE THE DIRECTOR SUMMED IT UP

00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:12.243
WELL SO. YOU THANK YOU MISTER

00:40:12.309 --> 00:40:14.078
CHAIRMAN BIRDS ROSS BROWN AT THE

00:40:14.145 --> 00:40:15.846
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE I

00:40:15.913 --> 00:40:17.848
WANT TO BEGIN OUR COMMENTS BY

00:40:17.915 --> 00:40:19.550
SAYING THAT WE DO AGREE THAT

00:40:19.617 --> 00:40:21.452
THERE IS CURRENTLY A- DEFICIT IN

00:40:21.519 --> 00:40:22.553
THE FUND AND THAT LEGISLATIVE

00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:25.055
ACTION MIGHT BE NEEDED- IN THE

00:40:25.122 --> 00:40:26.490
COMING YEARS TO PREVENT

00:40:26.557 --> 00:40:28.192
INSOLVENCY FOR THE FOR THE FUNDS

00:40:28.259 --> 00:40:29.760
HOWEVER WE DO THINK THERE ARE A

00:40:29.827 --> 00:40:31.729
COUPLE OF IMPORTANT FACTORS FOR

00:40:31.796 --> 00:40:32.696
THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER WHEN

00:40:32.763 --> 00:40:34.198
EVALUATING THIS PROPOSAL IN THE

00:40:34.265 --> 00:40:35.966
MAGNITUDE OF THE OF THE PROBLEM

00:40:36.033 --> 00:40:38.469
IN THE FUNDS ONE OF THEM IS MORE

00:40:38.536 --> 00:40:40.371
SHORT TERM AND ONE OF THEM IS

00:40:40.437 --> 00:40:41.105
LONGER TERM. ON THE SHORT TERM

00:40:41.172 --> 00:40:43.007
SIDE OF THINGS- FIRST

00:40:43.073 --> 00:40:44.275
ADMINISTRATION PROJECTS THAT THE

00:40:44.341 --> 00:40:45.576
FUND WILL GO AND WILL NOT GOING

00:40:45.643 --> 00:40:49.246
SOLVE ONCE UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY

00:40:49.313 --> 00:40:50.981
FOUR TWENTY FIVE SO THAT'S A FEW

00:40:51.048 --> 00:40:52.383
YEARS FROM NOW AS A RESULT IN

00:40:52.449 --> 00:40:53.350
IMMEDIATE ACTION TO ADDRESS THE

00:40:53.417 --> 00:40:54.718
DEFICIT IS NOT ABSOLUTELY

00:40:54.785 --> 00:40:57.021
NECESSARY THIS YEAR- IT'S ALSO

00:40:57.087 --> 00:40:57.988
WORTH NOTING THAT THE

00:40:58.055 --> 00:41:00.391
ADMINISTRATION HAS NOT PROVIDED

00:41:00.457 --> 00:41:02.259
A DETAILED PROJECTION OF THE

00:41:02.326 --> 00:41:04.061
FUNDING CONDITION- FIVE YEARS

00:41:04.128 --> 00:41:06.130
OUT WHICH- HAS BEEN DONE IN

00:41:06.197 --> 00:41:07.998
PREVIOUS- IN PREVIOUS YEARS AND

00:41:08.065 --> 00:41:09.567
SO THERE STILL IS SOME

00:41:09.633 --> 00:41:11.268
UNCERTAINTY ABOUT- WHEN THE FUND

00:41:11.335 --> 00:41:13.070
WILL GO INSOLVENT WITHOUT THAT

00:41:13.137 --> 00:41:15.372
ADDITIONAL DETAIL. OF THE SECOND

00:41:15.439 --> 00:41:17.875
ON THE LONG TERM SIDE OF THINGS-

00:41:17.942 --> 00:41:19.076
THE MAGNITUDE OF THE STRUCTURAL

00:41:19.143 --> 00:41:20.244
DEFICIT OVER THE LONG RUN IS

00:41:20.311 --> 00:41:23.180
ALSO UNCLEAR- THIS IS BECAUSE

00:41:23.247 --> 00:41:25.216
REVENUES ARE- AT LEAST

00:41:25.282 --> 00:41:26.917
ELECTRICITY SALES ARE PROJECTED

00:41:26.984 --> 00:41:28.652
TO GROW- UNDER THE ENERGY

00:41:28.719 --> 00:41:30.154
COMMISSION'S PROJECTIONS GOING

00:41:30.221 --> 00:41:32.289
FORWARD DUE TO STATE EFFORTS

00:41:32.356 --> 00:41:33.457
AROUND ELECTRICAL

00:41:33.524 --> 00:41:35.459
ELECTRIFICATION OF BUILDINGS AND

00:41:35.526 --> 00:41:37.428
THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR YOU

00:41:37.494 --> 00:41:39.230
CAN SEE SORT OF- SOME OF THE

00:41:39.296 --> 00:41:40.631
ENERGY COMMISSION'S PROJECTIONS

00:41:40.698 --> 00:41:43.067
ON PAGE SEVEN THERE'S A FIGURE

00:41:43.133 --> 00:41:44.602
ON PAGE SEVENTY SEVEN OF THE-

00:41:44.668 --> 00:41:45.970
AGENDA THAT. PROVIDES A KIND OF

00:41:46.036 --> 00:41:47.771
A MID CASE AND HIGH CASE AND SO

00:41:47.838 --> 00:41:49.640
AS A RESULT THE DEGREE TO WHICH

00:41:49.707 --> 00:41:52.409
A LONG TERM INCREASE IN THE

00:41:52.476 --> 00:41:53.677
SURCHARGE RATE IS NEEDED IT'S

00:41:53.744 --> 00:41:56.847
UNCLEAR AS RATHER. IN IN SALES.

00:41:56.914 --> 00:41:57.915
PARTIALLY UP OFF SOME OF. SOME

00:41:57.982 --> 00:41:59.516
OF THE DEFICIT. SO WITH THAT

00:41:59.583 --> 00:42:01.285
CONTEXT IN MIND WE DO THINK THE

00:42:01.352 --> 00:42:02.920
LEGISLATURE HAS SOME DIFFERENT

00:42:02.987 --> 00:42:03.554
OPTIONS THAT IT COULD CONSIDER

00:42:03.621 --> 00:42:05.789
ON THIS PROPOSAL- ONE OF THOSE

00:42:05.856 --> 00:42:06.757
OPTIONS IT COULD CONSIDER

00:42:06.824 --> 00:42:08.325
REJECTING THE ADMINISTRATION'S

00:42:08.392 --> 00:42:10.461
PROPOSAL THIS YEAR BUT ADOPTING

00:42:10.527 --> 00:42:11.896
AND SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING

00:42:11.962 --> 00:42:13.464
LANGUAGE THAT REQUIRES THE

00:42:13.530 --> 00:42:15.299
ADMINISTRATION TO PROVIDE AN

00:42:15.366 --> 00:42:16.533
UPDATE ON THE STRUCTURAL DEFICIT

00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:17.801
NEXT YEAR. INCLUDING A

00:42:17.868 --> 00:42:19.403
PROJECTION OF SOME OF THE LONG

00:42:19.470 --> 00:42:21.205
TERM REVENUES AND COSTS THIS

00:42:21.272 --> 00:42:22.673
WOULD BE SIMILAR TO PREVIOUS

00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:23.707
YEARS THERE WAS A SIMILAR

00:42:23.774 --> 00:42:24.808
REPORTING REQUIREMENTS THAT THE

00:42:24.875 --> 00:42:27.311
LEGISLATURE ADOPTED AND COULD

00:42:27.378 --> 00:42:28.612
ALLOW THE LEGISLATURE TO.

00:42:28.679 --> 00:42:29.780
CONTINUE TO MONITOR MONITOR

00:42:29.847 --> 00:42:32.449
CONDITION OF THE FUND AND TAKE

00:42:32.516 --> 00:42:33.517
ACTION AS NECESSARY IN THE

00:42:33.584 --> 00:42:35.452
FUTURE. IF THE LEGISLATURE DOES

00:42:35.519 --> 00:42:37.721
WANNA- MAKE CHANGES THIS YEAR TO

00:42:37.788 --> 00:42:39.590
TRY TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE- IT

00:42:39.657 --> 00:42:41.025
COULD CONSIDER ADOPTING CERTAIN

00:42:41.091 --> 00:42:42.192
ASPECTS OF THE GOVERNOR'S

00:42:42.259 --> 00:42:44.295
PROPOSAL- BUT REJECTING OTHERS

00:42:44.361 --> 00:42:46.196
SO FOR EXAMPLE. IN OUR VIEW

00:42:46.263 --> 00:42:47.898
EXTENDING THE SURCHARGE TO

00:42:47.965 --> 00:42:49.400
BEHIND THE METER CONSUMPTION

00:42:49.466 --> 00:42:51.302
COULD HELP ENSURE THAT- THE

00:42:51.368 --> 00:42:52.236
REVENUES COLLECTED MORE

00:42:52.303 --> 00:42:54.204
EQUITABLY EQUITABLY ACROSS ALL

00:42:54.271 --> 00:42:56.340
ENERGY CONSUMERS. AND WE ALSO

00:42:56.407 --> 00:42:57.741
THINK THAT TIME THE SURCHARGE

00:42:57.808 --> 00:42:59.710
TO- INFLATION IS A REASONABLE

00:42:59.777 --> 00:43:02.246
STRATEGY TO ENSURE. THAT FUTURE

00:43:02.313 --> 00:43:03.881
REVENUE WAS SUFFICIENT TO PAY

00:43:03.948 --> 00:43:05.616
FOR GROWTH AND BASS LINE COSTS

00:43:05.683 --> 00:43:06.917
SUCH AS GROWTH IN SALARIES AND

00:43:06.984 --> 00:43:10.287
BENEFITS FOR CC STAFF. IN BOTH

00:43:10.354 --> 00:43:12.723
CASES WE THINK THERE'S A PRETTY

00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:14.358
CLEAR POLICY IN FISCAL RATIONALE

00:43:14.425 --> 00:43:16.126
FOR THOSE CHANGES. I LEGISLATURE

00:43:16.193 --> 00:43:17.227
COULD ALSO CONSIDER OTHER

00:43:17.294 --> 00:43:18.862
OPTIONS TO REDUCE THINGS ON THE

00:43:18.929 --> 00:43:19.763
SPENDING SIDE OF SUCH AS

00:43:19.830 --> 00:43:21.532
SHIFTING- THERE'S ABOUT ONE

00:43:21.598 --> 00:43:23.901
POINT THREE MILLION- IN COSTS

00:43:23.968 --> 00:43:26.170
RELATED TO THE EPIC PROGRAM THAT

00:43:26.236 --> 00:43:28.205
COULD BE SHIFTED ONTO. THE FUND

00:43:28.272 --> 00:43:30.674
THAT TYPICALLY PAYS THOSE- THOSE

00:43:30.741 --> 00:43:33.577
COSTS SO- THAT LEGISLATURE HAS

00:43:33.644 --> 00:43:34.979
TOUCHED THE SUM UP THE-

00:43:35.045 --> 00:43:36.447
MAGNITUDE OF THE OF THE ISSUE

00:43:36.513 --> 00:43:38.615
HERE THERE'S KIND OF SOME SHORT

00:43:38.682 --> 00:43:39.950
TERM OR LONG TERM

00:43:40.017 --> 00:43:40.718
CONSIDERATIONS- AND THE

00:43:40.784 --> 00:43:42.386
LEGISLATURE. THE DIFFERENT

00:43:42.453 --> 00:43:43.787
OPTIONS THAT COULD PLAY TO

00:43:43.854 --> 00:43:46.824
ADDRESS THIS ISSUE SO HAPPY TO
