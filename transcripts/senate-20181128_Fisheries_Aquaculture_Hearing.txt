committees on fisheries and aquaculture we are so grateful you join us thank you so much many Butte travel far and wide to be a to be here today and we cannot tell you how much we appreciate your presence at today's hearings can be focus on a few issues one we're gonna be providing an update on a current ocean conditions in the dungeon it's crap season Dungeness crab as you all know was one of California's oldest and most storied commercial fisheries the first commercial commercial harvest took place during the gold rush during that just a few miles away from where we're at today in the San Francisco Bay we're gonna be providing a full briefing on ocean conditions and challenges the crap please faces as the season is now in full swing in most parts of the state portions of the north coast remain close to it due to elevated to mark acid levels we're also going to be providing a critical update on the efforts the state of California the golden state's crap and hard working environmental organizations up and down the coast have been making to avoid whale entanglements during crab season you're gonna hear from the director of fish and wildlife for the state of California today about steps the department legislature the administration has taken it will be taking in the months ahead he's gonna be focusing on the launch of a first of its kind plan to protect whales during crab season his comments today and we're gonna representation on the increasing threat of ship strikes on whales off the California coast grateful that the vice chair is here assembly member stone from Santa Cruz thank you so much Mister vice chair for tendon and for all of your work Sir I and we are so grateful that it's in the number fill team from the great city by the bay is here today we're gonna be joined by senator Wiener here in just a bit we also grateful to the team here at the query him up the bay for hosting this hearing we're gonna be hearing from their CEO here in just a bit George Jacobs quick update on tomorrow gas at levels -- we typically have doctor Rafe could delay here from UC Santa Cruz he's tomorrow gas of level updates and today he's traveling instances regrets the bottom line through his update is demo gas a doubles in the Pacific this year have been trending upwards particularly in northern California -- we were very concerned because in the beginning of -- the fall the trains were looking like two thousand fifteen which was the worst on record Humboldt del nor and seven organ have emerge is hot spots along the west coast however two thousand eighteen appears to have peaked in September and October and we are now seen declining levels of tomorrow gas it even in the north by and we do not expect and other state Y. closure like we saw in the disastrous crap year of two thousand fifteen that said I think that almost all this can agree the Pacific go see ocean is changing its sick and we have a new reality in front of us climate change is no longer a theory it's here in California's environment is paying the price no matter how many times are president says climate change is a hoax it's not going away our quality of life our economy our health in our environment will be worse off because of climate change and that's when the reasons why we are here today how we're gonna work together in the months to come to be able to focus on digits crap ocean conditions as well as protecting our majestic well population at this point I'd like to be able to turn the floor over to our vice chair by Sture stone I to be able to offer opening comments and we'll go to assembly member team Mister vice chair the for sure Sir thank you Mister chair welcome everyone to this hearing it's very interesting time in one of the things the secure that I very much appreciate this committee is done is it's really but a bridge between a lot of different stakeholders for some very difficult issues as we try and manage sustainable in industries is simple fisheries here in California ensure that iconic species like the Selmon it's androgynous crabs and others are very much a part of our policy making and how we understand interactions with the ocean we also have to recognize the changes in those oceans because of really global changes that have happened and the California led the way with the climate action so that just a couple of months ago and what was very interesting was California's position internationally with many many jurisdictions coming for putting a number of other states but countries from around the world looking for leadership out out of California and the conversation about what we do with some of the changes that we are saying so the first couple presenters we have from Los protection council and from fish and wildlife show some of the bridges and connections that we need to maintain and as we head into a new administration I think this committee can be very important in in helping to continue to provide those bridges between all of the stakeholders as we deal with issues around the crap fisheries impacts on other wildlife that we want to protect but also understanding ways that we can look at broader policy to ensure that the oceans are healthy is that's a part of sustainable fisheries as well I've had the opportunity over this last year to go to a number of meetings and conferences one most recently at at the muscle any marine lab which is the CSU's marine lab on aquaculture and tied into all of this and tied into the sustainable fisheries is California's position or lack of position with aquaculture and I think that's something that this committee is also very interested in looking at I know she protection councils of added as are the the departments and I'm hoping that over the next few weeks engage with the administration look at barriers to the challenges to the aquaculture industry in a productive way so that we can can look at Especiales shellfish and some of the the at the algae sea weeds that are currently being produced in California but in fairly small numbers that I think that there are ways that we can bridge that but without the science behind the changes that are going on without understanding of the breadth of the issues around fisheries then we're always going to be coming up I think a little bit short from a policy standpoint and that's why I think this committee and then we really should Mister chair can be a very good focal point for a lot of these discussions whether it's well entanglements whether it's looking at ocean acidification and changes in chemistry that fact tensely seafood industries we can have conversations about the regulatory environment and working with regulating agencies so that they can fulfill their mission we can protect the environment we can protect the state state ability of fisheries but also ensure the economic viability of some of these pieces that are very report to California and to California's economy so this is this is going to be very interesting hearing but I'm also looking ahead at next year and get making sure that this committee is well positioned to continue those conversations work with the incoming administration on some of these issues and really look to Friday California's strength when it comes the oceans and fisheries thank you Mister vice chair very eloquent I think you're absolutely right -- both on all issues of conditions within the Pacific I think the other issue that we're going to take a look at this coming year is -- which were excited about is wind energy the coast and what that may need for fisheries are -- re monuments as well as the fleet into that something else that we're gonna be I take a look at as we move forty and it really looking forward to you Mister vice chair -- on all issues coming up in two thousand nineteen you want to say thank you to assembly member team I was also chair of the assembly budget committee on he is here today aimed at a member of this committee in he's been such a champion for all issues fisheries and aquaculture some member the floors research thank you Mister chairman and Mister vice chair just -- really appreciate both your work on this particular issue Mister stone's comments like they think of some of our larger challenges that we've been working on all of the last number of years is really about sustainability making sure that we can have a thriving industry that sustainable -- long term that is also grappling with many of the environmental factors that we've all had to do with over the last couple of years -- so very much again look forward to being part of this committee -- this year this is I'm going -- this is my sixty one the committee that's been -- I think -- extraordinary work but -- it's been really an honor to be able to work with such an amazing industry for our state thank you thank you so much Mister someone number you wanna remind folks that were streaming live today on Senate dot CA dot god will also be archiving today's hearing we want to say thank you to our chief consultant to my left Mister Tom puesto for all of his work for hearing is well I and we now would like to be able to bring up George Jacobs chief executive officer at the aquarium of the bay at this check up thank you so much for hosting us and this is such a fantastic facility and we're grateful for your hospitality the floor is yours Sir check welcome to -- equity by the bay California's only Smithsonian affiliated a query thousand adults one hundred thirty species and -- falling the climate summit -- in September -- we decided to unveil the vision for the first climate museum notion conservation center in the US right here the current site a few slides of what this two hundred million dollar project would look like -- we are fortunate to have with us of a very detailed version of this -- this project branches so agreement bay is only one of them we run the eco center part for the port -- in a database and the bay academy the Bates to it on the bay model for the US army corps of engineers in Sausalito and -- also see line center which is on the other side of the act that the docks those are some of a lease properties of corporate offices across the street be employed one hundred and seventy five people and over three hundred volunteers the welcome about seventy thousand visitors each year this year the two as number seven down but with this new climate and motion conservation museum we are hoping to attract to two million visitors a year -- there are fifteen million visitors a complete the Embarcadero each year so by comparison told me income to the Golden Gate Bridge in fifty million come to the Embarcadero so we thought that if we can tap into five or ten percent of that number -- we will have an evangelized climate literacy and resilience at leadership for tomorrow so you get a sense of the scope and scale of the project international team of experts for the last eighteen months hours of work into this -- edifice and its C. early platinum building -- which has photo by reactors uses when power it is -- powered by Michael brick using fish waste and it has a lot of nuances in all the topics that Mr waste your message here mentioned earlier on including the my gas and ocean acidification sea level rise sequel Michael plastics disruptive technologies they're all part of this conversation including celebrating climate heroes it gives you a visual on what the Senate would look like hundred sixty thousand square feet with three acres of activated green space between peers thirty five and thirty nine since the deep ocean exploration centre in debts that shows you in relation to Alcatraz what the premise would look like I just wanna and and by saying that be delighted to host you here and somebody we have noticed in your honor we have a be a mural in the back and said -- painted by an artist from Thomas which we just -- unveiled a couple of weeks ago as the exact size of a baby humpback whale with fifteen feet thank you and welcome eighty so much just give a round of applause for executive answer please again we're very grateful for your hospitality Sir and thank you for all of your work and we look forward to seeing these plans come to fruition as well Sir thank you so much it's good to see you thank you we also want to say thank you to the entire team at the aquarium for all of their work in helping us get set up and get in this hearing move thank you so much we'd like to be removed for first panel now we're gonna have remarks from a bill that would never have percent cheese the ocean protective council executive director also the deputy secretary for oceans of coastal policy into the California natural resources agency we're also hearing from Mister Chuck Bonta music director of the California department of fish wildlife mind coming forward on this however status can be focusing a report on ocean acidification as well as efforts on Whalen turtle entanglement and their support of the well working group in the dungeon it's crap task is the director is going to be focusing his comments on the monumental efforts that the city California's been advancing a in regards to well entanglement and the launch of a first ago first of its kind program here in the United States of America out working with the federal government this have reset the floors yours thank you so much you have seven minutes and we are so grateful for all the work or happy you're here with us today thank you very much chairman and thank you assemblyman stone and assemblyman saying it's a pleasure to be here today director of the California mission protection counsel and deputy secretary friction coastal matters resources agency which is a mouthful and but at our mission really is to protect and conserve the ocean and you mentioned a couple of threats that and that the ocean is facing right now one is entanglement which I'll discuss a bit and the other is climate change which just infuses all of the work that we do and affects the ocean so significantly and in relation to Wayland payment OPC since September twenty fifteen has been working to identify and to reduce the risks and Waylon team woman and in dungeons crab fishing year we work very closely with city of W. with no way to convene and a really unique and effective collaboration and fishermen NGOs and federal and state partners -- in order to you think three to and how to best address and reduce the risk of will entertainment specifically intention is practicing here and we provided a grant to the nature Conservancy to administer facilitate this group which I'm going to call the the whale entanglement working group it's also known as the tension is kind of fishing gear working group that that gets confusing because there's also Dennis got task force and so I will stick with just calling it a will working group so the will working group the last couple of years has worked on developing a risk assessment in mitigation program and to determine where it when the risk containment is elevated and to identify measures to reduce that risk it's called the ramp and the ramp was highlighted -- in the last couple of seasons and under Senate bill thirteen oh nine by senator required and it was codified and the working group it's also codified legislatively and and director Bonham was given the authority to implement management measures and in the event of elevated risk so the real really represents an innovative effective partnership that's based on approach to develop solutions to decrease the risk of entanglement in concert with that program OPC also receive seven point five million dollars this year in the budget and assembly member take a to address the way on sea turtle entanglement and and we have been working with the way on the woman working group to identify appropriate projects that will help reduce that risk and and and separate out the the crab fishing if you're having a thriving crab fishery and having a very thriving we'll completion were really relying on the ramp program to identify those projects that that we need to implement and we have both short term high priority projects that were identifying as well as I'm developing a lot more long term holistic investment strategy and to the budget was at became effective July one we've already implemented to projects and one was at a grant to the California will rescue to support and I fishing dynamics and well concentration data collection and program through the use of solar lawmakers Anne's solar loggers are being deployed on forty commercial fishing vessels as well as twenty well watching and passenger vessels any idea there is to be able to collect data from both the fishermen who are out and doing their work and from the wheel watchers you least theoretically identifying where the well populations are and then bringing that data together performing analytics on it performing visualization and developing things like maps so that we can really see very clearly where the crap where the wheels and and think about ways to avoid entanglement and interaction the other grant that we provided was a million dollars to the wildlife health center at let's run through UC Davis I'm in that supports the California marine mammal stranding network and for stealing and seal rescue that was and actually -- -- specific appropriation as part of the seven point five million and and we've we've already provided that you the wildlife health center in order to address and remain standing in addition to the well working group we wouldn't working very closely with and then attention is caught task force and in since two thousand eight actually a PC has been designated as the body that's responsible for convening this task force and under another piece of legislation by senator required and we will be able to continue administering the task force in partnership with city of W. and and it is a separate administrative team and part of that legislation SB thirteen ten update the tension is packed task force election process -- and so we are working again very closely with city of W. downline a process and the timing for the next election because there's some changes in the composition of the task force I do you just want to note -- that as a world where there's going to be a new administration starting in January so for the members of the task force that are appointed by the chair and the ocean protection council with the secretary of natural resources there will be a delay you know and so we have a new secretary in place turning now to our work on commission acidification and more the climate change threats and that that proposed to the ocean the wildlife and fisheries and the OPC adopted in October and ocean acidification action plan and this is a ten year action plan and and it fulfills one of our commitments as a founding member of the ocean acidification alliance and and access acts as a model we hope for an for other jurisdictions who are who are members have this alliance the idea is to have tractable actionable steps that can be taken over the next ten years to mitigate ameliorate the realities of ocean acidification and we first became aware of ocean acidification from the the harm that was being faced by Washington state when they're western countries and their oyster industry collapsed and and we've been working closely with Washington Oregon British Columbia and now seventy eye there at international the jurisdictions to address ocean acidification I I do want to just point out that the science right now is indicating that the harm is not limited to mollusks is not limited to oysters there is and the potential for it in implicate crab reduplicated salmon and so the time this is really a critical moment when we need to be focused on an ocean acidification and how we are going to and mitigate those impacts and so that's what this plan does and we're now that it's past we're working already in implementing and the various steps included in and finally I just wanted to note that down the street today and California's track of fish two point oh kick dot and that is a really exciting anything innovative partnerships and it's a global program that incubates pioneering sustainable seafood businesses and brings them together brings together investors seafood entrepreneurs fishermen public agencies NGOs to really think through innovative new approaches to developing sustainable seafood and sustainable fishing programs and California and a P. C. supported this track and it has three main goals one is to -- address traceability and transparency one is to and develop innovations in sustainable local food systems and the fishing communities and the third is to increase resilience to climate change I'm so we're really excited to see that moving forward and and there will be a competition and winners will be announced tomorrow so I with that I and I turn it over to director on thank you so much and Weber sector you very grateful for your work Mister director we're grateful for your hearing -- they -- as the director is coming in -- it is being -- an incredible tenure offer him sea disasters that we faced as well as on land with all the fires as one take a moment to say thank you and your team up for all the work and what I mean talking about I cannabis legalization as well so -- which is available for that houses his that he may need some at the end of his tenure so -- it's running thank you so much for being here your work -- in here cannabis because well boisterous so the floor is yours thank you senator co chairs down assembly member ting secretary it's true my name is Chuck bottom and I'm the director of the California department of fish and wildlife just by way of forecast later today you'll hear from doctor creek Chiu minute the department he will have all the specific details around the general Dungeness crab season outlook the disaster relief process quality testing after that you will also hear from some key monster that the department who will walk you through the operational details of the risk assessment mitigation program that is right secretary announced in my time I want to step back I want to offer a few reflections -- based on almost the eight years as director and charter vision which I think you share with our department and everyone in the room and also when I try to make a little bit lives so crowds are big deal in California they're one of our oldest and most valuable fisheries and I don't know about where I grew up the floor of the all is all you all what all you all have on your holiday menus at home but I have Dodge's problem and then you come the crabs also supplied jobs to our coastal communities up and down the state but it's equally true whales are really big deal I mean literally there the most majestic largest animal swimming off of our Richard sure and I would say that what our department has done with a very broad set of partners to prevent well entanglement in fishing gear in the last couple years is a big deal also this state California's home to more biodiversity than any other state in these United States biodiversity is a measure of the richness of life our ocean waters are home to one of the most productive marine ecosystems in the world and California's consistently rank very high protection of our ocean but in two thousand fifteen something happened that was pretty disturbing to everyone in this room we saw rising wait a rate of Wales entangled in fishing gear the number of reported entanglements jumped in two thousand fifteen and two thousand sixteen but dropped considerably in two thousand seventeen in two thousand eight and that dropped by some accounts was as much as by eighty percent but the spike in two thousand fifteen and sixteen corresponded with things we've never seen in the ocean it corresponded with a change in ocean temperature then tagged as the warm water and we saw a corresponding change in the abundance and location of the food that whales which is krill and small fish so because it is Ocean change the whales chase their food closer to shore and that brought them into traditional fishing grounds in in those fishing grounds in those years was an unusually high concentration of year for crabbing because we had an unprecedented delay in the season from incredibly high levels of the mall the gas in in some since we had an unholy convergence of these several factors any corresponded to that dramatic uptick in entanglements we were all concerned about it even one whale or turtle entanglement is too many and that's why the department and our partners took swift action in two thousand fifteen as you've heard mention by the deputy secretary we establish this working with my next point is membership is really key to me it should be key to you as well in membership drives our future here's what I mean this working group is comprised of commercial and recreational fishermen in one it includes environmental organizations some of whom you'll hear from today it includes members of the disentangle my network it includes marine mammal experts and resource managers we formed in two thousand fifteen and they adopted one unifying principle they were gonna support both a robust Dungeness crab fishery in reduce well into mutually exclusive because of their work our department has at a platform to take specific action so here are some of the things we've done in the last two years we have informed all crabbers that everybody must check their gear every ninety six hours during the season we've created a program to retrieve derelict fishing gear from the ocean which senator you sparked legislation we've collaborated with industry to develop will friendly year we've actually adopted new rules and got them in place before the season began limiting the number of trailer bill is in a link to fishing line that can be used and with clarified through the voice of our wildlife officers that everyone must remove their fishing gear at the end of the crab season and we're going to enforce that since we're in San Francisco I'd be remiss if I didn't say tech can happen can help to hear you heard a description of some of the technology that's been invested in with seed funding by the protection council but the point here is we can do better we can get more immediate transfer of water observations in ocean conditions both from our beliefs and our will watching vessels we can force that information into better analytical platforms give the information to those in the working group we can make instantaneous decisions to try to manage this risk profile technology can help here will and were marching along that path but I would argue the single most important change comes from senator your legislation SB thirty no not most people don't realize our crowd fisheries primarily governed by the laws established in the legislative process the department then and previous to this bill we had no authority to take certain actions we now do we now have the specific legislative authority for the first time to implement time area closures as needed gear density restrictions for require specialized equipment but I would say even perhaps more importantly SB thirteen oh nine memorializes the working group formalizes their role and breathe life into their great work going forward I think what's happened in the last two years is probably the most progressive and protective commitment by any state in the United States to deal with the way on tackle the problem but I also think we can do more nobody wants wells entanglement entangled the turtles and take with you don't we don't our federal counterparts stone hard working members the crap please don't environmental organizations don't so huge shout out to my hometown paper the San Francisco Chronicle some of you might have seen a published an opinion editorial last night this morning I'm going to confirm the news with broken that opinion editorial last night our department gave formal notice to our federal colleagues at the no with fisheries agency within the department of commerce that we intend to submit a conservation plan to minimize and hopefully eliminate the risk of entanglements from archive fisheries and to receive approval under the federal Endangered Species Act for the conservation I checked no other state agency to our knowledge is taking its commitment to protecting marine mammals thus far me divert for one second climate change it's not theoretical it's not just a scientific issue it's a real it's painful and it's causing impacts the people and things we care about two thousand fifteen and sixteen was a problem because of our changing ocean conditions the movement of our large mammals in the ocean the interface -- with our fishing community because of a on usual to mark as a situation that may happen in the future more not less this conservation plan we're going to do will help us get a headed will help us secure federal approvals and that leads me to our vision as you heard mention the OPC has seven point five million dollars to this effort at our department we now have staff thank you senator McGuire and subcommittee for budget and assembly member ting our department and governor brown leadership working with you has produced specifics that would be dedicated to the will and hang on that issue and here's the vision I think the vision is a future where crap stays on a holiday menus forever where coastal communities are thriving and resilience in the face of a warming climate and changing ocean conditions and where we can all look westward look out into that magnificent Pacific Ocean and see whales and turtles swimming and our marine environment free from the risk of entanglement it's a good vision sound vision to feasible vision we asked the support of everyone in getting there together so with that let me pause and see if you have any questions for the defense secretary for me thank you so much Mister director we like that opening up to the committee for ask questions we will be going to public comment twice in two days agenda once after agenda item three in in another time after item six at this time we like to go to ask the committee Mister vice chair sitting this one if you can just walk us through what this process looks like -- its first of its kind the only state in the union that will be advancing a plan like this walk us through what this looks like an I think some will com is that going first it's too risky but my rebuttal would be it's okay to be first California typically go face first on a Tana's that makes a difference nationally and internationally being first can often solidify your position as a leader even though going through something for the first time is awful and more painful so I don't have a precise road map senator but here's what I would predict are some of the pieces that will be in are coming days months first in my view we have the group assembled it's are working group they need to stay together we need to keep supporting them with investment a capacity we need to let them shape substance I see a submission of an application to our federal sister agency it would define a conservation plan you could look at the impact of the any activity on the whales are turtles it would illustrate steps to monitor and embrace technology it would define the measures we would take to minimise and mitigate any impacts it could walk through a series of actions it hopefully will embrace the ramp program which is already well under way -- we would need public comment as we go through the federal Endangered Species Act process we would like we need an environmental kind of document platform for the eventual permitting decision on the federal front -- it's possible we would -- go out to public comment these are a lot of decisions that would be incumbent upon our federal sister agency we would feel responses and then we would do it -- rations of our conservation plan based on that feedback and eventually approved I see something memorializing are working group and I see something producing a conservation plan in the regulatory certainty that are crap fleet needs onto a federal permit will it take a month ago is going to be easy not two years I think a little bit of that is determinative upon assembling this crowd and laying out of time on because we are going first a he said that in your right being the first is always a risk I think the risk is greater -- if there is no action required by the state of California right I agree -- and needing to be able to move as quickly and as thoroughly as possible excuse me I apologize and find a call today -- in know that this is being a lot of work community days hearing to be able to make this announcement -- are you gonna need some additional resources as we move forward well that's a great question given the leadership on the panel across from me on my budget front I look for to that conversation if I'm director in two thousand nineteen and we go through the budget process I would also remind folks listening this is not the only thing our department will be doing your SB thirteen oh nine yeah requires us to complete state based rule making some of which we started some of which we've completed other provisions we need to advance to the end that will allow us to memorialize and state law and structure the ramp the working group -- and we have a deadline in the state statute to complete all that work so in my mind we will be harmonizing multiple regulatory platforms to win in goal which is that vision I describe the two thousand fifteen we had about ten wailing tackle means on average but we peak in two thousand fifteen of the California coast a fifty billion with the forty eight and sixteen N. F. pretty a significant decrease in two thousand seventeen thirty one -- a what I'll say the reason why I bring that up is when we saw that peak year two thousand fifteen which was the worst year also for crap action -- a now we wanted to create a foundation for success success for my reading and feeding whales in the future century for California story crap please I am very grateful for that I think the other item that we need to be able to discuss of which we will -- later today is issue of ship strikes so -- we have been very focused on all issues seven tango and rightfully so is unacceptable these numbers that we have in front of us are simply unacceptable I which is why you're department and hundreds from across the state of the working out with the fleet to be able to limit the number ten comments and to be able to get that two zero and what's not talked about is a number of whales that are being killed every year with commercial vessels and that is also a growing concern I know for this committee is we would for I don't know if there's any item that you would like to be able to come in a way to set if I'm still director in two thousand nineteen I would be working and focusing on that issue as well I'm very grateful -- Mister director for all your efforts on the case hearing get the secretary for a group of your effort I know that -- it's just beginning -- my last question for you you've been having conversations with your federal counterparts -- an airborne to be able start looking for correct yes -- I think you may hear some of that later today we have a very productive working relationship with our west coast counterparts on federal agency Nazarian fisheries service nama and late yesterday I spoke with the western regional administrator about our department's attention and it was a positive conversation that's great but I could see if there's any comments from the committee we follow up in Texas Debbie sector think so much Mister director thank you for being here we're very grateful for your time thank you as we transition to our next panel we do want to let everyone know were maybe having a small reception immediately following hearing how we're grateful that a hog island as well as -- seafood for bringing in fresh oysters and we're going to be happen crap is well we wanna think Reagan John Robb for all of their support on that and everyone is welcome we now would like to be able to move to our second panel of the day this panels can be focusing on charges crap in the season tomorrow gas in the quality testing a disaster relief updates if we could please have doctor Sherman please come for doctor Sherman is the manager of the marine region for the California department of fish and wildlife he's gonna be providing an overview the status for crab season crap quality issues as well as the current status of the federal fishery disaster declaration were also great for the been seen he is here he's chief food safety section -- the chief of the food safety section for the California part in a public health he is on the other side of the coin when it comes to testing we have to go out and capture and then we have the test -- through the department of public health and we're grateful that you are here today is well Mister yee he's gonna be providing a brief overview of the tomorrow gas a testing process -- and some concerns that we still have particularly on the north coast we also going to be what we know Oppenheim he's a executive director of the Pacific coast federation of fishermen's association he represents up and down the California coast he's gonna be given is a state of the state if you will of the crab season in the process and distribution of disaster relief for since the two thousand fifteen sixteen season we're gonna ask each for prisoners if you don't mind pulling that microphone close to you -- just because we're having some challenges hearing folks -- on the web so we're gonna start out today with a doctor should the technician you have five minutes Sir we welcome you committee thank you so much for being here we will go to committee coming in questions in the public comment after this panel action morning senator McGuire culture stone assembly member Chiang store was low thank you for the opportunity to speak before you today and correction memory region manager California department official wildlife and I'm gonna give you a brief update on the general season outlook for Dungeness crab demote testy in disaster relief in implementation of SB thirteen ten women and try to do have all in five minutes or less open on time on November third in all areas except for the area from Patrick's point Humboldt County north to the California Oregon border that area remains closed due to elevated levels of demo like acid in the meat of testing crab -- this is something that's new we typically don't close the recreational fishery from a recommendation from the health agencies we had elevated levels in the meat issues of that something we are keeping tabs on we are getting reports of good catches from the recreational fleet and lots of reports of short crowds of people are already very excited about next season on the commercial front this other central management area open on time on November fifteenth in all areas except for the area from bodega head north to the cinema Mendocino county line due to elevated levels of too much acid in the district tested crap weekly testing is occurring in partnership with public health and the fleet to test samples at a restaurant try to get that area in the northern management area quality testing commenced in early November and the guidelines established by the tri state Dungeness crab committee in coordination with the California department of public health to verify areas that are clear tonight gas it were testing can occur results from the November third testing let were low quality meat so that led to a notice from director bottom on November twentieth to delay the fishery to December sixteenth the second round of quality testing will occur around December first two discernment to determine if we delay until December thirty first if me quality is still low another round of testing will occur to determine if we delayed until January fifteenth I'm last season we are not able to test beyond January first for quality but new authority provided by Sen requires SB thirteen ten enables us to continue testing be on January first of the season will not be delayed past January fifteenth so that testing can occur to help the fleet with a market choices details to make our privacy at -- California department of public health but I will highlight that on this is been a long road force we've learned a lot in the last three years at it and I want to thank my colleagues at the department of public health at the office environmental health hazard assessment and also the fleet we still have a long way to go this is a new program -- we lacked they're sufficient resources and infrastructure to make this a permanent long term program that's something I think we should all keep on our radar one of the ways we are trying to address that is through some of portion of the disaster relief funds so in early September the department submitted to spend plan to the Pacific states bring fisheries commission to distribute twenty five and a half million dollars a disaster funds to California dungeon is a rock crap fisheries the vast majority those funds eighty nine percent will go towards direct payments to those fleets with the balance going towards mitigation programs at a small piece to P. S. NFC overhead the drafting of the spending plan was facilitated by extensive out reach with affected entities including to web meetings to share the pro spending plan to solicit feedback the department intends to solicit request for proposals and establish a stakeholder advisory group to help develop criteria and priorities for use of the mitigation funds we're still working on the details of that approach and welcome any feedback from the committee or stakeholders all of the details of the spend plan the timeline are highlighted on our website and frequently asked questions document as is the proposal so I will go to those details here -- I'm happy to answer any questions you might have regarding the ten for the dentures crap fisheries of new approaches for this year first I wish to thank senator require your staff especially Tom less low for your leadership on all things that just grabbed -- recent changes to the passage of SB thirteen ten include changes to fair start language that will apply fair start to any area of ocean waters subject to a delay in the season opener and to find a delay to the tri state quality or human health risk delays when areas that are delayed are open the director now has a story to provide set up to seventy two hour notice between outs in an open area and when the gear set time begins and this area was will not include holidays and some we ran into previous seasons of this having clean that gives us some structure these new rules will apply to the Russian river area when it eventually opens -- frequently asked question document was posted on our website in early November you can imagine we got a lot of questions from the fleet so all that information is on our website it will be updated as areas continue to open up we've also been working with our license revenue branch of law enforcement vision to update vessel size requirements to establish a baseline link for dungeons craft also permits of questions from the fleet so we've posted another frequently asked questions document on our website and to try to answer those questions in closing I want to thank the committee for your interest in your leadership on all things crab fleet this hasn't been easy for them want to thank our NGO and agency partners and I also want to recognize department staff -- particularly Cristian sees a in the back Christie rate raise your hand so three three years ago Christie's only job was to serve on the Dennis crap task force and then she became our demo gas at asper are well expert and is just another finally get some additional resources to ease some of that burden on her every time we open and airy or close an area it's a flurry of documents that need to get signed by the director that need to go out of press releases the need to get updated on the website frequently asked question documents and put together this year and and Christie's really been responsible for a lot of that -- to that -- closing happy answer any questions you have at the in the testimony is measures should be would you want to say thank you Christy it is not an easy three years on a lot connect yeah and we're very grateful for all of your efforts to please pass on our things to everyone back at the department in which she when I think you you hit the nail on the head it's been -- one of the most challenging times in the history of the crap commercial harvest at least sixteen devastated many rural communities many real close of committees up and down the state that the funding that was she was discusses about twenty six million they came from the federal government disaster relief wow that is not going to help a hundred percent of what was lost -- it was -- absolutely necessary unfortunately took quite a long time to be able to get it delivered but we do want to say thank you to Congress would have been as well as congressman Thompson -- in Congress woman spear for their efforts they were instrumental in bringing that forward there are two sides of testing of crap obviously you have the department of fish wildlife and then you have -- mystery and focusing on tests and -- the -- the meat at the crab and making sure that it checks out printer over the mystery you to be a gives a update on all issues the judges crab season what he's seen from those tests are you have five minutes certainly thank you for all of your work it's good to see Sir good afternoon Mister chairman vice chair assembly member ting and Mister Russell local you for inviting us here today -- my name again is Nancy and I'm the food safety section chief of the department of public health of the drug food and drug branch I'm here today to provide you with an update on the post harvests the mode acid testing and focusing on crabs and the recent lobster data I also want to acknowledge in the audience -- doctor David was era and our -- who is our division chief and our program specialists Cristina grant was been a instrumental in our in our work here within our department there are multiple programs that work closely together to monitor potential impacts and risks of harmful algal blooms in the ocean the governmental management branch monitors bloom conditions in the ocean a potential pre harvest risk and impacts while the food and drug branch where I work monsters postharvest risk in impacts on seafood products had two servers food drug laboratory branch performs the more as a testing on the fish and shellfish the department in coordination with the California department of fish and wildlife and industry which are who are critical partners has begun pieces the pre season testing of the mode acid endogenous crabs we have been watching the data come in and hoping to see all of the sampling points below action levels unfortunately we have two areas to the north and the Russian river area with samples above the thirty parts per million action level I'll provide an update on the current advisories in effect and then summarize the results right someone of for our slide here we'll just do that manually for you if you just want to shout it out okay great great thank you advisories are currently are in fact in the following areas Dungeness crab caught in state waters from Patrick's point in Trinidad to crescent city that was issued back in October twenty fourth Dungeness crab caught in the state waters around Russian river in the database area issued back on November first -- rock crab caught in state waters around Santa Rosa island and or the Channel Islands in Santa Barbara county issue back in may two thousand seventeen rock rap caught in state waters north in minutes you know county to the Oregon border issued back in April two thousand eighteen number to go into the data -- the results as of eleven -- November twenty six two thousand eighteen results from the two thousand eighteen pre season testing of dungeons crowd the most recent sample sets are from north to south St George reef with hundreds and six craps above the action level Trinidad north or seventy percent or one of six crabs above the action level Eureka all crappy little action level what brag all grass below action level the database seventy percent or one of six from the Russian river area or exceeding the action level half moon bay all and sexist go all crappie low action level Monterey and all crowds below the action level immoral bay all crappie love action level switching gears the lobster data as of November twenty six lobster results are the following the California part public I'll only receive samples from the Ventura and Santa Barbara channel area in late September lobster from the and a cap on it exceeded the federal action level twenty parts per million or as high as two hundred ten part million additional samples were tested from October and November which have tested below the limit the number of November test results clout C. PH to lift the health advisory originally issued back in October seventeenth for lobster vysera cart around and a couple islands in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties as a reminder of action over democ acid and lobsters is twenty park million in internal go organs or the visceral or cuts if you may -- of the and the meat even increase in Boston even in preseason testing when eight location comes back with the decedent's we require to clean set seven days apart to remove advisory to go back in a little bit talk about our postharvest testing or department routinely test the crab restaurant and such as lobster etcetera and up to this year's preseason testing typically only tested to meet with concentration the bizarre or at high levels typically over a hundred parts per million for this lobster and crab season C. PH with the support from the office of environmental health hazard assessment is testing to meet all animals exceeding thirty parts per million in order to gather additional data in a line with the testing done in Oregon and Washington C. P. H. works with the California fish department of fish and wildlife to coordinate with fishermen in the designated areas ports of landing along the coast industry support has been critical and I repeat has been instrumental in critical in obtaining additional samples with the impacted area so our department can make a determination as to the potential risks to public health we wish to thank them publicly for the hard work and support the provide to us our department has been and continues to post results on the website up folks can do a search -- for food drug branch là mÙt acid and the public industry and NEC interested stakeholder may check the website for updated information as a reminder see page has the no ability to modify the -- le alert levels their set at the federal level we are required by federal and state law to enforce these level as are other states I have some information from other states as well thousand eighteen the Oregon department of agriculture and organ department of fish and wildlife and out the commercial and recreational closer all crabbing on nor on the southern Oregon coast to the California border due to elevated levels of demonic acid the Washington department of health have reported low to non detectable levels of demo Cassidy razor clams and mussels Washington fish and wildlife has not had any fishery closures related to crabs in closing I want to thank you for your time and for inviting us today realize sickening six the significance of our actions and I'm here to reaffirm the department of public health is committed to working closely with our partners agencies fishermen and associated industry and the legislature to provide timely and relevant information thank you thank you so much Mister you were very grateful we're gonna hold questions until we hear from Mr often nine this is our state of the state if you will -- the crab fishery you heard from both departments now who are managing the fisheries wells focusing on public health we're now going to hear from the fleet itself about what they are seeing out in the ocean this year strap ninety of five minutes to for shores thank you Mister chairman Mister vice chairman assembly member ting in the store was slow -- on behalf of the fleet -- welcome to the port of San Francisco we are sitting here not three hundred yards from the beating heart of the bay area's commercial fishing industry onions no often I'm I'm the executive director of the Pacific coast federation of fishermen's associations representing fourteen organizations -- from Santa Barbara to the Oregon border bringing healthy sustainable Denton this crab and other public trust seafood resources to the dinner plates of Californians Americans in the world it's a pleasure to be here with you and I'm I'm delighted to be able to report that here in San Francisco and other ports in but a good day and to the south of crab fishermen have been able to bring thousands of pounds of Dungeness crab safe to help the local crab to market -- it is not the case of north we are continuing to see -- the delays in the season due to the stabilization and -- an uncertain climate driven by -- factors that we are certain about those factors include global climate change by fossil fuel -- emissions to the atmosphere in there impacts to the ocean -- the scientific causal connection between those impacts and the impacts to our fishery into our members -- is clear -- I want to thank you Mister chairman for your leadership in this process three leadership on Senate bills thirteen oh nine thirteen ten -- to our friends at the department of fish and wildlife to the governor for advancing the request for commercial fishery disaster assistance to the secretary of commerce in two thousand sixteen as we all know that fishery disaster was declared in January of twenty seventeen appropriations were made by Congress in February of this year twenty eighteen with the department to put together a spend plan that will be equitable -- and we believe forward looking and forward thinking in its approach to advancing approaches the mitigation in this fishery desperately need -- but we also need financial support for our hard working members the sweet I want to thank them for maintaining -- and an upper to face of devastating challenges financial hardship and in the face of knowing that this is our new normal that commercial fisheries in the state of California particularly for station fisheries crab fisheries are going to be facing the mower gas it challenges -- in every single season -- that we are are going to try to -- -- whether it be here in San Francisco Bay or to the north or in states to the north -- we know that this is our new normal and that is why two weeks ago the Pacific coast federation of fishermen's associations filed a lawsuit in California District Court against thirty fossil fuel industry companies for their role in producing this situation for knowingly continuously -- promoting their industry and the and the products that they sell to a and the damage that it is because to a commercial fisherman and to the coastal communities of the state of California and the state of Oregon these companies very the truth about the impacts that climate change will have to the oceans to society as we know it and two in particular commercial crap fisheries so we will be holding them accountable and we look forward to seeing them in court in the meantime we're delighted that certain parts of the state have dodged a bullet this year and that we are able to prosecute this fishery but delays continue -- commercial fishery disaster assistance is coming and we're grateful to our friends in the federal government and the California congressional delegation for moving that forward -- and I just want to provide one comment on the continuing crisis -- the the political crisis -- and the solutions that we are coming up with relating to wailing tango in this fishery I do what I want to say that I am pleased to see that California is going first and stepping up to the plate because when the federal process prevails fishermen come last I firmly believe that the well working group is maintaining the fleets ability to be in the driver's seat and to be complete and total equal participants in this process our voice matters and it's being heard our colleagues in the state of California are listening and you're gonna hear from some of the members of the working group later today and public comment -- and on a panel later -- about the work that they're doing tireless hours of their lives to solving this problem the fishermen do not want to see wells entangled and we are going to be -- strong partners in the process to address this problem head on so with that I will be glued in thank you so much for the opportunity to give Mr outlined and the drop in on you do appreciate all three of you gentlemen for being here today we think we are open up for questions or comments from the committee Mister vice chair Q. so question to the agencies mention resource I think this committee has a interest in your success and making sure that the state is providing appropriate resources to address the issues that that we are fine and to become the budget question it is going to be you have the ability to interviews but I just change composer process we of course have the ability and whatever I put pressure this point on our budgetary because I think this is something that this committee and the budget sub committees need to be looking at but I would think it would be appropriate if we could get the help of the agencies to support your working with apartment finance as well as our essential ability to make I request influence budget to ensure that you have appropriate resources and this is even a bigger question that double Cassidy because water quality testing is something that has been given a short shrift in budget conversations in the past in the past number of years and yet if we're really going to create the basis for addressing changes in chemistry the oceans more toxins as they come in from on shore are shorter developing water quality testing as well as testing the product that the state's responsible for through part of public health and through that for many fish wildlife really becomes credit so I'm hoping that we can work with your agencies and they you're making proper requests that at war that working with this committee that this committee could put together a package to look at how we make requests within our budget cycles to ensure that you have the right resources without putting you on the spot it would be great to get to be able to work with you over the next couple of months and make sure that we're asking and that you're asking for appropriate resources that we can back that up so that we get the testing done as it needs to be done I think that's one of the things that we can do for the industry is ensure that that testing is happening appropriately smoothly and is adequately Joe like to comment on that what would come and I'd really going to put you on the spot you have really should the department of finance and don't miss you want to do that but if you can help with either now or in the future on what we're talking about the way resources the scope of what we'd be happy to ask for that and how we navigate the politics of administrations process in asking for its budget as well as the legislative that's it would be easier for us here but -- let's say that that getting too detailed I'd say we welcome the opportunity to work with the incoming administration to advance that every part that offer that request right thank you I to be a I would say that we service here the same use the echo the comments -- that we welcome the opportunity compare bad band with the resources we have we do the best we can and I would hope that the legislative budget process as well as the administration with respect requests coming out of this committee so is the chair but the is good I can work on that a work with the committee on what adequate resource pack I guess the right frustration and -- there was about finding that was advanced both for fish and wildlife AD PH -- in we actually saw -- funding card out -- and Avalon asked the department public health to come in on that today that is incredibly frustrating because you -- have what are moving together are más on the and really the ones that are doing the work for you see a lot of the funding that is needed is an apartment public health side Britain's the testing so I think you're absolutely right on in the for the working with vice chair and to this committee on a fancy that I know that -- similar ting was all over that as well and make sure that we're able to see that but again we will get into -- past years looking forward out we actually need to ensure that our public health has that plan as is the consider aye aye what is get a better understanding of I heard a lot about testing and what the scores are not significant amount what we can do to reverse the situation I mean I know part of it is the environment easy to cast fingers and other people what can we do as a state to better try to mitigate the situation in hearing to respond to that question the California judges crab fishery needs to be managed to become more resilient in the face of what we know will be our new climate feature which is currently what we're seeing today and what we saw in twenty fifteen and that's a buzz word managing for me what does that really mean what we know that commercial fishing businesses need to be stable they are subjected to a new form of a risk that they were not before other industries manage their risks far better than we do in California -- in commercial fisheries -- we do not have any sort of financial mechanism or capital facilities to be able to insure commercial fisheries in times of struggle a hardship -- make ends meet pay the bills when boats are tied down we need to develop the financial tools to be able to address this to let our fishing businesses be resilient to the financial risks of of closure and delay we also need to be able to address the more gas it head on we need to know more of -- when it's coming we need to develop the predictive tools that can enable fishermen and agencies to be able to determine what business and management decisions they need to make ahead of the season otherwise there are lost in the dark or we have impacts that are far less predictable and therefore far more damaging than what we would otherwise encounter and then I believe that we need to develop tools that can deal with them all gas and there are certain approaches that could potentially be used -- decoration or the holding of crabs that are known to be toxic until the talks and can be cleared out is one solution another would be developing sensors or other devices that can more easily detect demo gases -- that technology currently exists but hasn't been implemented in this way and that's why I think advanced society and in the bay area here in San Francisco particular can be helpful there -- and I'll just make the the point here that these are all very expensive proposed requiring a whole bunch of capital on a lot of investment who's going to pay for the -- is it going to be the fishing industry -- we we've already described the financial hardship we're dealing with is going to the taxpayer certainly the public owns the resource and has an interest in bringing an end but organization believes that the company is the fossil fuel industry is the one that should be held accountable care and that's the nature of the lawsuit that I mentioned earlier and I'm not allowed it is as best robin I pointed out as with most things climate change right now it's adapting to it not tried to prevent it and I don't see this anytime soon being able to prevent to mark asset outbreaks in our waters that the scale is too big the sciences is not as well understood -- but we can do a better job understand the biological pathways what conditions in the to the production of the toxins our those toxins working their way through the food chain once we understand that we may be able to move to prevention -- I will note that -- of that ten percent of the disaster from that set to mitigation that's about two point five million a much of that money will go towards our indie to try to answer some of these questions and that's really what that competitive grant process is set up to do is to try to figure out how we can best adapt to it from the department's perspective -- see page public health perspective one at that our role is to Medicaid our findings the results so they can be used from the data can be used to have some kind of prevention strategies are usually use for future -- -- thinking so besides the rise in temperature notions or any other thoughts about what else is driving this imbalance in the system -- we know that ocean acidification is also a confounding factor it's a it it's likely that lower PH results in greater expression of demo like acid in the algal species that produce it sit in the chair -- further exacerbating this problem of course lower PH and warming temperatures are correlated scale oceanographic phenomenon like the blog -- that we saw in general -- with just less up Welling therefore water being delivered to the shelf because system is also I also just want clear fire just make make sure of -- potential ideas in terms of medication things at nine six situation what I would really -- saying is it's very difficult to move forward with anything on a large scale in many the reason you mention without with enter standing problems so tell we really have a better understanding of what the problem is and whether it can be manage -- locally and it's very difficult to say or to justify any sort of large expenditures yeah I'd be delighted to commented that if -- if I may um without question we we do know what the fleet knows what the problem is it's the inability to go fishing for our members and our business that is the problem and when we focus on the immediate annual scale measures that need to be taken in order to address this -- I believe that we do have some of the solutions and we know precisely what we need to do from the agency perspective -- agree with with doctor she meant that we will likely not be able to take action that will prevent the trajectory that we are on -- we need to acknowledge that we need to rather than trying to throw money at problems we can't solve the immediate in terms of preventing warming of the oceans -- in in our budget process we need to take action that's going to ensure that businesses can continue to operate and did to do the kinds of research which I believe we can do in order to build those predictive tools that I spoke thank you so much interest in just one last comment I think that it too is we're talking about finding you know just make this comment that -- this year we're going beyond the guts of this rare was some concern that we're seeing -- impact on me I is one of the high test up north I think -- that's an item that we're gonna want to be able to discuss how we can have to be a ticket we're gonna need to move into more advanced manner find testing -- as were seen that one hundred tax I know it was isolated but -- if that's going to mean any different procedures within the department not asking you to comment on issues of budget but does that mean anything different on your folks on the ground when it comes to -- individuals in the lab and testing additional time to make separate to route tested meet samples of a you know it it obviously you know were I can you know we're doing the best we can with the resources we have to do additional testing tional tests be it we've been primarily worried about the guts with that's where -- the higher acid levels to be if you will store and what we had this year is it when you're on the gods and in the me correct -- in just wondering if we see the and again I want to be clear that was an isolated test sheer additional time for your folks on the ground in the lab just wondering about what that looks like for you obviously you're gonna run additional testing or to me -- yeah it's gonna require additional time and resource to run those analyses that's great she will follow up off line -- là should mean just have an additional compensation January sourcing thank you so much but before we adjourn this panel would like to be to see if we have any additional comments from committee Mister to this vice chair right German thank you so much we're very grateful for your time you know we'll see here just a little bit you know would like to be able to open up our public coming in the first portion of public comment what a second after a two nine six any individual can can speak with the committee I welcome to be a step up to the spike you have two minutes anyone on a on the first two panels welcome any public comment green sea no public comment we're not gonna be bringing it back to committee together bring up our next panel is six panels can be focusing on whale entangled in ship strikes how we're gonna be hearing a briefing and well taken efforts as well ship strike concerns we could please have the following step fort Scott been seen as a research fisheries biologists the southwest sign center with no fisheries we're grateful that beautiful consists here he is the guy on the ground for no up -- in he's a marine mammal health extremely response program manager were also great for the cut rock what is here he's a senior marine ecologist four point blue conservation science Mister Benson is gonna be focusing on the technical aspects of the entanglements in no was collaborative support of the working group efforts on a and he's gonna be going through the date out looking at the numbers the tiny locations train six said Rep Peter Peter is the person who is on the ground or if you will and he's gonna be given this -- an update about what he's seen out there when they're focusing on entanglement and we're grateful that cut rock what is here and he's going to prison in the research which shows that management efforts to be able to guide ship trafficking decrease overlap of whales and fisheries could decrease deaths significantly if there is a coordinated effort and that simply is not happening at the moment we're going to be de do a deeper dive on this issue later in two thousand nineteen so without further ado we're not gonna be turned over to Mister Benson with no a fisheries to be able to give us the data with well taken circular five minutes once he thank you for all the work it it's been a busy unfortunately a busy few years -- you the floor is yours at thank you very much for the sovereignty share the status with you I want to make it clear however that -- I -- imprisoning this on behalf of Dan Lawson in Lawrence signs with the west coast region office -- and Scott Benson and I lied leatherback turtle research here in that California's west coast the state marine reptile -- and so happy to do this on behalf of Wharton fan of next slide please I can we can do for you if you see next light that's perfect thank you got it okay excellent all right I'm in payment of marine mammals in fishing gear is a global problem as you probably -- also where on the east coast -- where in payment of -- north Atlantic right whales is a major concern for that population -- our agency Nazarian fisheries services at unified large well in payment fishing here long the US west coast as a primary prime priority management issue -- these entertainment reports are up opportunistic and clearly in under estimate of total and hang -- many factors contribute to integument reports being under estimate and has to be found by somebody other person needs know how report that -- there've been four hundred fifty wailing payments reporting California since nineteen eighty two -- and as you mentioned earlier there's been a recent spike in entanglements hundred seventy seven reports during two thousand fourteen to two thousand seventeen and that's actually forty percent of all contain reports since nineteen eighty two so as you mentioned before a relatively recent -- concern in terms of make getting people's attention next slide please this is the long term -- -- data for this -- as you can see here that a averaged about ten and ting once a year until the late two thousands and then jumped up to thirty three on average during two thousand fourteen two thousand sixteen the majority the reports do originate from California all the wells roles reporters and tangled in Oregon Washington again this is for the west coast region or in California Washington and -- in two thousand seventeen there was twenty six confirmed entanglements thirty six reported and in two thousand eighteen were actually above that number with twenty seven reported and thirty six -- -- to exceed the twenty seven confirmed in thirty six reported the higher number this year is apparently trivial to -- a greater -- number of anything what's coming from Washington state next slide please the humpback whales and gray whales on the most commonly reported species in this is an important point here is that in California we have a here and that California Oregon Washington stop with that stock is comprised of two different we not known as a distinct population segments so this is a in this case we have an endangered Central America -- DPS any threatened Mexico DPS the be in danger Central America -- GPS as is a smaller number and so that it's important to know that the fees -- but no recognizes the to DPS is even though we had they are also recognized under the marine mammal protection act as a stock I hope that's clear to everyone -- gray whales are also -- entangled in this -- in these in fisheries here -- at that population has been stable since the nineteen nineties -- humpback whales have been increasing -- the blue whale population eastern north Pacific is stable and the fan will stock off California or Oregon Washington is also increasing these of the species that are primarily involved in ten next slide please this is the summary for two thousand eighteen twenty seven confirmed -- humpback whales again -- you know are the majority of the entanglements gray well six we will one unconfirmed in well one on one confirmed one ident on identified -- day most of the payments are involved with that dodges crab fishery part that's because we know this because that fisheries marked -- well with other traps or mark well and -- I'm also a volunteer on the local discontentment network and so when we have a says successful disentangle we can retrieve that indeterminate least in cases of -- Duchess crab -- if that was actually the fishery that was involved but other fish fish excuse me other fix your fisheries that have had inhaled whales include -- spot Peron -- that's humpbacks sable fish long line humpback gill net gray whale and hump back -- stripe shrimp spiny lobster also both compact although dungeons crab is most often -- identified expertise in about two minutes Sir thank you this is a locator issue shows locations where the most and the tech and hang which have been encountered or have been reported it's important to note here that the places that are highest are areas where much more people on the water Bay less so in some of the more outer coast areas -- the next next number okay this is just for Dungeness crab alone and in this case here we're looking at a by month -- you'll see that there are greater number reports during spring and early summer it means that could be attributable to the fact that that's when humpback whales here it could also be attributable to that's the time when more people on the water and at sea conditions are more favorable to see these things were before two thousand thirteen said ninety percent reported since two thousand thirteen again that coincides with the marking of the gear that's fine next what we don't know -- here in tango and get a fining integument origins -- so where to focus management and research efforts -- understanding configurations of the gear involved knowing the number of entanglements that occur we know for sure that's an underestimate under S. understanding how we'll behavior in gear can lead to in in in payment once an interaction starts and then long term understanding the outcomes of these entanglements at the animal is going to be able to survive or in reproduced as normally or if it has been compromised as a consequence of the intake interaction that's all I have thank you thank you very much Sir will be opening up coming to the committee in just a moment we're grateful that Peter focuses here he is the chairman of the ground -- representing our marine mammal health industry in response program he's gonna tell us what he's been seen out in the ocean conditions as well Sir we welcome will give you a five minutes thank you for being here thank you for inviting me I will say that -- I have several of my to some tangling team with me here today -- several behind me for Scott right here you might is asking to stand up for a second so we can now recognize simply guys that are on the network the latest stand up if you're part of the team's having give you around of applying right thank you for being here yeah thank you so much for for inviting me have an hour presentation you give me five minutes all poll jump through this to make it happen I want to make it very clear that -- the complexity on how wells becoming tangled is much more complex than most people have considered and on the other side getting them disentangled is not as simple as yelling Sam Sam jump on the will cut the line and so I'll take yours going after transferring area of primary speech is involved as Scott mentioned we are humpback whale in the gray well it's interesting that ten years ago the gray whales were more calm than the humpbacks -- and that has switched recently and -- other species of concern of the blue whale simply because they're so large I worked on two blue whales and they're impossible to disentangle from the water is there to get their tests so big and powerful Ryan can attest to that -- north Pacific right well we haven't had any of those entangled legally but as that -- species recovers if we get entangled right well on our coast is gonna be a game changer -- other species known fan well killer whale meat you will create is and -- sperm whales oops because back up there are a number of different types of entanglements -- suggested to you've gone Carillo some for some reasons jumping off in every type seven tango one we have a a usually includes the mouth and particular concern is when the math entanglement drops back to -- the back of the mouth so we have the head -- we have an appendage Gaines inventor please well we need to bring the flippers advance -- threat cake -- lumbar region which is a large body entanglement other peduncle and which is the tale technically flukes and the -- compound complex entanglement in this particular animal it got involved with fifteen sets of here and twelve Travis and each one of the steps and involve the mouth a flipper the flu and most of the body and we completely disentangled sort of free this is what -- if Jackson Pollock was a fisherman what his gear would look like more diverse than simply -- of the most common stuff they were seeing out there is from police blue steel rope -- the three stranded -- which is very common in the ground fisheries also the monofilament long line which is the action on the animal tends to be a like a -- cheese cutting knife you can cut into the barber very easily also mention on three strand district three strand rope tends to be very abrasive and can -- can kind of cut through like sandpaper and -- looks if you go back up there -- the -- -- gill nets or another going out -- that tend to be completely engrossing the well and the -- -- -- keep going guys the same net -- which are to blow through the same nasco one more and -- but they carry a lot of the -- gear on them as it was cut into the body and then we have the other which completely in in gross the -- the recent don't and aquaculture here we have a great will that got entangled in and aquaculture frame and we stir frame and we had no idea how to deal with this animal -- we've also had -- just anchor chains -- of world getting tangled in encryption the injuries caused by entanglement are are quite varied and they range from irritations Chiu -- death -- abrasion and chafing -- is very uncomfortable for the animal we assume -- but is generally not life threatening physical defamation of a funny appendages in other parts of of the body this can affect their ability to feed officially and -- -- sometimes these defamation jerk or certainly -- permanent -- we get amputations of the -- flute blades this is more catastrophic to hump back because they -- the power into their food -- and the -- a complete application of the here with this great well we also get the -- here here's one in which -- we got the flu but not the rest of the well that are -- amputated this occurs both in gray whales and humpbacks this usually occurs when a line cinches around the appendage and then it -- starts to group to grade and cuts off circulation and then it instantly falls off others also nutritional stress this is one of my greatest concerns simply because it immense amount of suffering that the animals going through this condition it takes -- probably a month or two -- cam like this and it's all a period of of fear and stress we also get infection an infestation of this is a gill net on agree well -- restricted disability to move and feed and and the likes to go over then we also have a direct effect of drowning the animal on on the net contributing factors is much more complex than simply a well encountering the -- of the fishing gear a lot of it has to do with the well behavior a you can see right here that this impact is on its side this in normal feeding posture for a humpback whale and you can see the -- crap you're in the background and so when the line is vertical and in the water and will speeding on its side where there's a high density of mouth of the well for easily and what happens is that line migrates to the back of the mouth and then starts to cut through the webbing in the back of the mouth is is if you took dental floss and you took your mouth back here years and and that -- diminishes the the efficiency of feeding -- they get to click it again to make this video role others also the well behavior that they they love to twist and turn him by looking at some of the underwater behavior the and we can kind of see how they get wrapped up in loose line in the water this doesn't happen as much of the line is tight this loose in the water you can get pretty severe others also the rogue behavior something that we're going down with the help of some of the people in this room electric Aug and -- John mail or and and Jim Anderson is trying to understand what it is about -- this line if you look at this there's a number of loops -- splices knocks and float that all contributed to the complexity of the intent of meant that twisted that then became very severe and so we're looking down -- ways to simplify the rogue behavior so that -- the way -- will will be less likely to become entangled pointing counters the line and I think this is a very -- to go down effect okay that's actually good -- to back it up please I just gonna say are responding to large one tangle Mrs is a very large team effort in addition to the five -- stranding network members -- that all participate -- in this information -- such as the -- response cards -- a number of years ago just before you saw a big spike in report is we self published something that I've I've shared with everybody -- to help educate the public on what to do to -- get as good information so we can -- get out there and -- and affected just entanglement a number of factors are considered in advance of actually doing to disentangle men and they're all listed here I could talk for an hour on everyone of those but essentially it's is not simply a reaction is that we consider lots of different suffering in the well and Max my safety for the respond entangled will response we have these other things that we go through we have a process from of the analysis to evaluating the demeanor of the whale trying to figure out how long entanglement spent on the likelihood of success -- we we need to hit it to get the -- video going what back it up but one of the things we try to do I think if you click it digital video overall we tried but never on -- what this does is -- when I'm trying to show here is that we try to reduce the system so that all we have to do is one cut and if this video role that you would see us actually -- a Houston right to just cut once that's right memory better -- so it's going to invest the next one of our biggest concerns is it didn't mean or the well rare occasions just the well actually understand why were there and so we get situations like this if you look in the uppermost on the left there's little silvery object that's are cutting tool and this represents away all that that and -- -- trying to get out of the intent of an after Kerr we have a bunch of custom tools that we work with and -- most of them are designed -- by our members -- for various purposes and approaches we are telling the truth on the far right cutting tools in the middle is retrieving the gear -- this was -- that animal a crescent city that had -- fifteen sets and twelve traps in each set we retrieve all of the gear we don't want to leave any crap in the water and so my team works very diligently to retrieve all of the venture with some water we don't want ghost gear we don't want to also developing responding partners on the California department of fish and wildlife to will become a part of this with their boats like -- marlin and some near the books they have Coast Guard we need to get some training together to get them up the last couple of years they responded really really well I've asked for a -- twenty foot -- rapid response the they gave me a -- cutter the last time so they're being very involved -- the network is several needs not the least of which is reimbursable response costs and I will say that in the -- on the bass fishing fisheries bill of right now not specified as a line item turtles is but -- large well response is not -- we have new tools we want to develop -- I think -- California department fishing game needs to have its in the show on this outreach material -- we need training and cross training -- monks not only all the network members but -- but also the government agencies and I'll I'll mention very quickly at the bottom -- we need support for research for understanding how the becoming tangled and I also mentioned DS W. DSW disaster service worker of thing it's a program in the state already at present none of our respond or is have any sort of insurance for doing something is stream we dangerous and I was on the -- over the last few weeks and all of us were covered by the state program called DSW and something I would like to see is that the large well be covered under the disaster service workers -- workmen's compensation is essentially what it is for and and I think that will help only qualified responders to get out there and do it rather than having people that figure that they can have a quick path to get on the Ellen DeGeneres show by jumping on a will so we're gonna be conclude here pretty quick that's my last one eighty two so we want to say thank you for all of your work were very very grateful that we have questions but what do a right after we hear from current rock which is a senior Marino ecologists with point look conservation service we've heard about -- not only the extreme challenges but just as disturbing images and why it is so -- that we act together to be able to protect California's majestic well population here and we have another challenge a and nowadays ship strikes with large commercial vessels cut is going to be doing our first dive into this issue we're going to do a deeper dive later this year the bill to give you Creek preview we're grateful Mister rock with a service record your five minutes we're gonna be here might just make sure it's green and you have a pull that up if you don't mind is beautiful working for good all right thank you guys for inviting earlier entanglements are important issue this is a meeting about sustainability fishery conservation of whales but -- this in ten minutes she doesn't happen in isolation ship strikes are part of the bigger picture so I've been tasked with giving you a little bit of that broader perspective so at point blue one of the things that we do work on is trying to understand the ship strikes issue as long as well as -- working on entanglements it'll give you a little bit of a brief presentation at the end -- but my research focuses on -- decreasing well gas from collisions with ships and we publish some work last year that it was intended to -- filled what it's been a long standing gap in understand a and died and understand the numbers of whales that are being killed by ships out in our oceans on the west coast -- to do that we used calculations based on what is -- originally enabling counter model train understand how often two ships come in contact with each other we did that instead for ships and rails -- and were able to then estimate the number of deaths for humpbacks fin whales and blue whales along the west coast are we could not do that for gray well because we do not have the underlying data to do so -- and when we look at the results of those -- ladies what we find is that it is likely that more than eighty whales in total among those three species are struck by ships each year are within the whole west coast federal waters and so or blue as a number of different for the different species for we will fax eighteen per year humpback whales are twenty two and fin whales forty three and that means that for blue else that's about eight times and for how back about twice the federal guidelines that suggest that set the number of human because mortalities that should occur from all combined sources and not just ships right so we're getting a lot of death beyond just -- the net or from ship strikes back go beyond that -- acceptable number if we look a little bit more closely on the distribution this is representing the top ten percent of -- mortality estimates and you can see that the those high -- high risk areas are concentrated off because California particularly central California and southern California -- but the good news is that we can -- address a lot about seventy four percent of the blue whale eighty two percent a humpback whale and sixty five percent of been whale deaths by looking specifically at these regions so we don't have to think about the whole can look at a smaller area and the main ones that have been really tested and and and shown to have success had been done on the east coast for for blank right whales and those are speed restrictions and the traffic routing to avoid rail hot spot so knowing where the wheels congregate providing ship shipping routes that avoid those -- those areas there are other potential solutions that are being explored but these are explored but these are really the only current solutions that we have and they they happen to be successful so just to put that in perspective you can see our estimates force ship strike mortality there on the left for each of the species and that's compared to the annual estimates from no -- for entanglements which are for hunt backs fourteen per year about one blue whale per year on these are for the lack of average for the last five years and a half of an where -- and so you you get the sense that for humpbacks these two sources that are about on the same level but for blue whales and fin whales ship strikes are actually much greater issue than entanglement although again with caution the wells -- we're just recently first found to be entangled in last year so that may be an emerging issue so also just a quickly give you a little bit of preliminary work to be done on the entitlement -- issues directly with -- right without see on both whales and crap part densities -- for a number of years and since two thousand and eight we've been -- we've been counting the the crap parts that we see in the water so with some preliminary analyses we've actually put together some models about the distribution of crap parts which are hard to -- to get that information and so this is kind of a an initial -- asks Atty understanding where are and and the temporal -- changes that occur -- through time and and and for the years that we have done those analyses from two thousand and eight to two thousand and seventeen we can break those up into sort for years which are warmer water years and cooler years and find that in the warmer water years but appear to be construed close to the shore and at higher densities than in the cooler years and that is particularly during may of those years -- because that's when we have data for so that is of interest in understanding how co occurrence between whales and crab pot at combining our models for this regional sales and the distribution of crap parts we see that in general -- on the left those two are the observed entanglements and the predicted model results of a co occurrence between wells and car parts and in general those preliminary models show -- that the that is capturing that years -- with improvements we can probably get better and we also see that -- occurrence of these maps here show co current and is also stronger in those and former -- water for years and closer into shore so we're looking at -- potentially some of the causes for this recent spike in entertainment and that's all I have for now so if you have any questions the switches record when we open it up to the comedian seat by Chad any questions or comments one thing that's been part of the discussion and looking this is probably a question for even some of the other panels but we've identified will entanglements where there observer and we've been trying to get here labels are we able to identify or track back to where the table that's happened with any certainty or are we really just looking at where we observe it and try and rescue that way out there and so because if we can build a correlation of there's more that we need to do to to better understand where the tanks are actually happening not just where there observe because that could be quite some distance in quite some time it's up with something we do on a regular basis is that the fisheries tags as soon as we know that there's a fishery on their -- we notify Lauren and Justin was Becky down it nor purity and they contact the fishermen to see if they want to come out and help us retrieve their gear and so we're able to get information on where the gear was set how long it has been since the will shows up with and tangled and and so we can do that for the dungeon is crap we can't do it for the other fishery where we were there's no que and something that's going no I don't think I've level to add but you're exactly correct to do it mean the tags do help do that and we would be great if other types of fisheries also had similar types of tags we did it again do that kind of investigative work as you mentioned it just because the word cited does not mean that's where they entanglement encourage and these animals can carry this gear around for weeks to months a year several months -- which confounds thing so -- as Peter mentioned folks are working on that part of it for that data together from the disentangle months we've had but it'll it'll take some time that the the data we don't have that much data yet because there are things it seems to be key to all of this is is real data and be able to collect the data and reliable data of not just where the wealthy take a well with a counter but but we're eating county year to better understand some of those patterns and relations and we are getting cooperation with the organ fisheries -- the most recent disentangle when I did was with an organ tagged with brought down to Oregon because I can understand why they're identified in the Monterey Bay with the about a well watching and both center out there they can see them more often last further up the coast but that's not where they're being taken okay if we can better build relationships with our neighbors to the north and figure out how we can get more types of fisheries indicated at least figure out where they are coming from but I would think help without in that there's another issue in that regard that we're starting year as how long does it take for a certain level of -- injury to happen on the way I'll so in other words we may find a entertainment that was actually encountered a month possibly two months earlier which which and then kind of changes your monthly distribution of the commonality of -- of entanglements and so if if he throws a little bit of a monkey wrench into having a real fine data set but -- if we can identify different animals been injured for six weeks the and it came down from Oregon we know that it doesn't impact the California -- dungeons crab fishery in terms of a statistic of an entangled so better job with research and that's again I think an appropriate role for the state is to figure out how we can facilitate with some of that research but then also working with the industries that bigger better able to identify which here where and and how that moves as we understand what the well to some thank you thank you so much was vice chair just a few questions and building upon -- the vice chair what would you say when you come across a well it's been a table and I know that some this is guessing are you thinking that that will have been integral for weeks -- in this is made ongoing problem maturity rainy season what do you all see on the ground or what is your guide -- from taking a look at -- majority of cases week we've seen entanglement was observer and our response was six hours later we also have a situation where we know one animal was entangled on October first and was disentangled on October twenty eight and so we have a sense of the level of damage see the entanglements and tell their on for at least a week or so -- but when we start to see -- diminish tell they've been on for three three to six weeks has the public become more aware yeah yeah yeah absolutely the public has become more aware and as you know well watching is a growth industry the water and that they are also becoming more aware on how to report these things we can add one other dot quick note that -- when this was published it was first distributed Monterey and as soon as this was distributed the number of reports of intangible wealth went up by an order of magnitude to talk about the -- in the numbers the numbers and going down since the peak year two thousand fifteen connecting to your -- the city sixty shows why should check seventy two just a bit but Chiu believe it's because of the efforts that's been happening in regards to please originally came to us and said we needed to be a to do something about it which I've never seen industry do before right say if we don't fix this we will be around right now and we have to be able to -- come up with some long term solution since then we've seen that -- decreasing entanglements I'd like to go to get that what you're seeing on the ground if you believe that the efforts that have been happening here in the state have been working I think the information you're gonna get from -- Jerod a little later on that his study of of the ocean cycles and climb in the ocean I think is a stronger -- influence of the incidence of entanglements we are actively doing I mean we're essentially farm and we go out there and put out the fire but -- proactively though so you you think I I get it so you when you say that they can two thousand fifteen we saw the blob and it was very warm in the ocean the creel in angel beats for the increase in because we've seen a cooler ocean since two thousand fifteen that's why we seen a decrease in in in in the big influence I believe is that year when they had the big delay yeah there was what -- Jim Anderson says was a derby mentality for there's an immense amount of gear that was put in got it and a lot of people from out of state put in hundred feet of water and bingo tell -- cam it's kind of I can speak to that a little bit to get go head -- so a couple of things we can only address may because that's the only time we have data for those a little bit later in the season but show it in our preliminary models is that that that year when there was the delayed opening of the fishery there was definitely a lot more guilt here still in the water in may and further out offshore so that's clearly and issues the that sort of the development of the fishery three times after opening -- those parts tend to move off shore as the inshore waters get fished out tend to be occurring the other thing that we found with some of our data is that whales are actually a lot of writing earlier to the area and so that means that there's more overlap tempore early with the fishery I'd like to switch gears to -- fisheries that well spaceship strikes by the name when the concern that we have is no formal tracking the number you put up on the screen were eighty whales -- in total -- I would have been guessing here that that's a fraction of what we see talk to us about how you came up with the eighty -- because one of the items that we are talking about prior to this hearing is there is no formal track in the last in the majors sees it or to self report I don't think there's a whole lot of self reports out there correct -- in so in the other question I have is why so many fin whales what what is that -- with the dynamic that you seen yeah -- so there the formal tracking is is not too dissimilar from the entanglement so but of course you don't see whales struck very often they do come into court on the thousand ships so that's the that's the analogy there -- and then of course there's the whale carcasses that washed up on shore and a necropsy shows that there was one for strong so those are the two sources of -- definite their debts -- number so we can find it so are you saying that you're correlating those eighty two those two scenarios that you just mentioned for example yeah so so the number of wells that washed up on shore we can gas or with some analogies to difference studies have been done on other species that are out between less than one percent and about twenty percent of whatever killed make it to shore and so -- you can take the numbers doesn't counted and multiply it by about twenty to get that and that's what's so that's another way to get out of the number will serving collection strikes any that is close to the numbers that we found in our fault so -- so then the model is first represent the actual number of whales why so many fans so fin whales have a much larger population and there are also distribute a little bit for the offshore so that may be except for in southern California with a lot of traffic so so those two factors are really within the northeast you mentioned speed restrictions as well as traffic routes -- is this with in state waters -- that at these are these informal rules talked with people go little deeper to that yeah so on the east coast there's a mix of things there's management areas where there are speeds instituted in the time of year when the whales are most likely to be present established where there are known to be high abundances of the whales who's overseen the rules so that no -- puts those rules in place and the Coast Guard forces -- -- no -- are you has a role in enforcement of ships generally if we can know where the whales tend to agree and that's consistent year to year that's -- of big copy on -- then we can guide ship traffic around that and that can be within state waters so that official ship lanes for example here off of San Francisco go out just about to -- the shelf break which is about thirty miles off shore so we're looking at some of that and bring it in state waters and some federal close today and you believe you said you believe that that has had a positive impact is far sure wells being -- killed in just is it in a bottle Takasu walking through that yet note that there has been a lot of research done on the right whales and these guys because they are so endangered and so the research has shown that since those rules were instituted there's been decreases of -- up to eighty percent in terms of the ship strikes so it's a major factor in terms of the quality the whales there because right whales are so coastal and they're so well known as a lot fewer of them so it becomes more challenging here on the west coast I think but none the less so seven other thing too it's important to note is that no has been working on this issue particularly within the shipping lanes here off of the because the bay area and the Santa Barbara channel and they do have voluntary speed limit -- and there has been some corporation by the shipping industry but it's moderate compared to the corporation seen on the east coast where those regulations are required in the are there any consequences any fines in place -- and he's coast on the east coast yes yes there are fines for shipping companies that do not comply with those people this is going to add that in Alaska other similar results -- and in Alaska the deal specifically with humpbacks which are more common out with us so it's with the final ask is consistent with what he said about this because you mentioned -- disaster service workers in being able that I get that implemented for those who are out -- -- in the intake on the detailing the teams anything else that you think we should know prior to concluding this panel that the all the all of the official -- responders or actually -- put into certain levels depending on their experience ability and and so on and the -- functional responded for level two three and four of us got to level three -- Brian backer flow three available for and so we are all recognized and we are on the national permit one eighty seven eighty six as recognized isn't paying works and so we have a way of training evaluating and advancing a proper disobeying orders respond this is there anything else you think you may need obviously resources what we heard you say is -- -- the way it was in the on the misspell it not listing knows who are at a -- a dissenting the whales would be to be a clean up correct the other piece that we heard is -- the the disaster service worker a decoration anything else before we conclude that you think we need to be able to know of the last two years there's been of emergency funds of parks on the hundred thousand dollars yeah which has greatly -- helped our situation hasn't solved it but it did provide the ability to -- pay for one third of the cost of a proper response vote for five of the stranding network participants and so now we have some standardization in the state so that Scott can go down to Long Beach and have the exact same vote that he uses up in moss landing and and then affected disenchantment sort coming coming up with some standardization and if we can get that as a minimum -- we can continue -- advancing what we're doing thank you semester Jim thank you so much your timer the grateful thank you for a job today we're not gonna be moving on second last panel this one is issues in actions that have been made across the state to reduce risks of well table made from fishing activities we have several individuals whose get we're going to be coming up and I talked with us today we're going to be bringing up Kelly say see who's the administrator California scrap fishing gear working group if you could please come forward wagered Santora whose associate associate researcher from university California Santa Cruz go banana slugs sake master -- program manager marine region of the coffin apartment fish and wildlife we have our doctor Chester who is the capital program director for ocean as well de clock commercial fishermen from the database and we're grateful that Kelly is here she's going to provide an overview of the working group its charge what it's been doing in talking about its progress as well and some of the highlights from eighteen nineteen Kelly we're gonna kick us off it's always good to see you welcome back you have five minutes my name is Kelly sees and I am the principal and co founder of strategic or consulting and have the pleasure of serving as an administrator of the California dungeons crab fishing you're working group which I will refer to as the working group throughout I just want to acknowledge has been some really wonderful comments already made about the working group's effort so I will try to not duplicate what has been said but hopefully further enhance I'm so we certainly want to thank the drink twenty for having here today thank you so much on behalf of the working group so in September twenty fifteen since been shared that the department of fish and wildlife in partnership with names and group to identify and be responsive to this elevated risk at elevated levels of entanglements into just cried fishing here and I won't go into the composition of the working group has been talked about a lot but I think that in addition to this diverse group of stakeholders to come together it's also important to acknowledge that they're surrounded by scientists and such as doctor your ten Torah legislative can I stop consultants such as Tom west low -- and others in the room including Peter full cans who act as advisers to the working group to help supplement their efforts the group is committed as we've talked about to identifying solutions that support thriving we'll populations and other marine life along the west coast in a thriving unprofitable dungeons crab fishery and has identified a number priority areas to center their efforts including improving available data gathering and reporting exploring gear modifications and other technological innovations and also our region communications to the industry and others as has also been discussed -- in may twenty seventeen there group started to develop and produce a process to identify and assess elevated levels of entanglement risk to determine the need for management options to reduce risk of entanglements and that is that risk insights and risk assessment and mitigate and program the ramp and we have doctors in as interim Mister master who be speaking more about the details of the ramps I won't go into for a lot of that but there are these conditions are factors that the working group focuses on such as borage distribution oceanographic conditions -- distribution in concentration of whales and things like season delays to understand how that informs the relative level of risk of foreign ting commence the lessons learned that for the working group to be effective it requires consistent reliable and standardized informations we've been talking a lot about the data that needs to be available to help inform on the ramp in this effort the working group supports and is involved in a number of collaborative research projects to help inform the ramp including aerial surveys solo longer pilot testing gear modifications and innovations and developing bass fishing practices and Jeff Chester and Dick Aug who are working group participants here on the panel I will be sharing updates and their perspectives on these projects in just a moment this is learned from the twenty seventeen eighteen eighteen ramp pilot were at fault evaluated by the working group and the twenty eighteen nineteen ramp reflects those updates -- and the working group welcomes feedback on the ramp including how to better assess risk considerations for possible management measures and suggestions related to new technologies and information learned by of your during the twenty eighteen nineteen ramp will be shared with this committee in addition to the department names OPC the fish and game commission into the California dungeons crap task force as that's available to just very briefly on the working group is deeply appreciative of the legislature for allocating seven and a half million dollars at the general fund to the OPC to address the issue of will internal in tangle men and Jeff we sharing a few highlights on the working group's twenty eighteen nineteen recommendations which included unanimous or unanimous request for the OPC to allocate general finds -- funding for the ramp operations those projects has been awarded which is wonderful and thank you and that in that memo that includes those recommendations was submitted to the joint committee on fisheries and aquaculture in October are the working group would like to think senator McGuire free support in developing Senate bill thirteen oh nine which included a number of recommendations made by the working group -- in the during the twenty seventeen eighteen season and one that the -- maybe important to highlight as was just mentioned recently one is requiring standardized cure marking to be implemented by January first twenty twenty which the department will work with other fisheries are is the intention to help address the significant number of unknown cure types of this conversation around here markings and then also as was discussed permitting the director of fish and wildlife the internet thirty as of January first twenty nineteen to respond in consultation with the working group to circumstances at elevated entanglement rescue into teeny to work together with the working group the department in partnership I'm in others to adopt the criterion protocol to evaluate and response to potential entanglement risk moving forward to the working group I continues to be committed to the work -- improper story I'm just gonna say one other thing qualities on the working group would like to also acknowledge the proactive steps that the department is taking on including implementing commonsense year surface gear regulations in title fourteen for the twenty eighteen nineteen season which again was mentioned -- and and beyond the twenty eighteen nineteen season to reduce potential integument hazards and the working group values to direct communication and coordination cooperation with the department of in developing these regulations and future regulations thank you are we continue on behalf of the working group continues to be committed to work in partnership with you all and and respected federal and state agencies and also with the Oregon and Washington working group's which our counterparts in other states that are working on this issue as well ample pots there thank you very much thank you so much for all your of working please give our sincere thanks to the group as well please all the ship all right we're not gonna be turned over to Mr San tore a mistress and tore a -- we are so grateful that you were here today the -- doctors in Torrance associate researcher for the user in receipt California -- he's gonna be providing really that ecosystem perspective on -- Ocean Klein made creel all the forge fish issues -- as well as potential risks for and -- entanglement in -- doctor I mean idea also look at warm water conditions in why that is being so troublesome out over the last three years as well I'm sure you can include that in the presentation but if you work you can just add that to the presentation of five minutes Sir it's good to see you thank you so much for being here thank you chair for inviting me to speak to the all right Hey that's exactly of their ego alright okay -- my name is Jared sense or a hat and I'm a social researcher the university of California Santa Cruz and I study ecosystem dynamics -- Friday different ecosystems and when the I'd like to make clear today is that we we need to make a clear distinction between indicators like demo gas and or see service temperature those indicators are symptoms of an on health and environment but it's key to understanding all this is to examine the processing is on there underlying these events and so that's where I've been focusing on the last few years just read live some of this history because it might -- we might be going through it again sometime in the future the working group as scientific adviser in two thousand and seventeen which I spend so you know a good good man of the year developing a synthesis fifteen sixteen entitlement issue and it's a hypothesis as want to be clear about that and one thing I haven't heard today is that one thing that's key to this is that there's been a long term increase and well one of the populations are recovering combined wells are recall -- the second component of the hypothesis is about the large marine heat wave that we experience also known as the blog what that did was intro habitat compression warm water encroaches upon our coast and there was still good up Welling in twenty fifteen twenty sixteen it was just very minimal compared to the past we had good up well and was very very restricted along the coast on that for system he heatwave -- correlated with the of the prevalence of persistence of tomorrow okay acid that we know about and it also resulted in the confines of creel populations and -- there was basically no food in town for the wells it gives me great pleasure when I hear about directors everyone produce my Ste the said the system down to a few soundbites that means I've got my message across the group populations tanks and the only food that was available was a near shore anchovy concentration and this is from the perspective of a humpback whale they will switch over to beating on for traditional move ensure where there's food available to them arms that pre switching is a key aspect of their behavior and their behavior is fundamentally different when they're feeding on Carrillo versus the feeding on fish the more acrobatic and more -- like Peter showed in his -- is some of this video there with the Wells twist around a bit more than a bit more active when they're feeding on fish versus creel they can just go down deep and then swim through across -- but this the third component is that this ample fight co occurrence as we heard earlier all the gear that one out due to the fishing delay that one out late twenty April twenty sixteen result in a lot of entanglements but one thing I want to make clear is that there was just money there is nearly as many entanglements in twenty fifteen the pres the previous season as it was during the the the the other we had a fishing delay and that was because of this habitat compression that happened to the blog so the end result which is consecutive years of high tide spacetime overlap forging wells and fishing our this is a time line that I put together that kinda illustrates this ecosystem perspective as we move from two thirteen was which was a record phenomenal cold upwelling year creel populations were plentiful there all the hot spots that were available to wells were were available and then in late twenty fourteen the blob starts to can starts to develop three that we had an el Nino that combined with the blob that impacted the the whole -- appalling ecosystem of California but shortly after that after twenty sixteen delay what part of the reason why you see a decline in the entanglements that we return to normal cool up Welling conditions in the creel population started to come back principle pray for the wells of this kind of just walk through some of the the key elements of the price which behavior in some of the the for jobs and conditions this synthesis that I that I worked up and I presented the working group -- enabled us to come up with the risk assessment mitigation program in terms of these different season seasonal assessments preseason the mid season in the late season Kelly had mentioned sake will expand on one of the key aspects of this is this first points a basin scale -- some potion climate and regional condition drives winter and spring time up well and we have a lot we are rich one time series in California thirty over thirty year time series that I've I've played on heavily to produce the senses we know exactly what's going to happen in in spring if we look at the winter time there's a connection there we can make predictions going forward -- so these preseason mid season late season components for the different aspects of the ocean forage community is something that we've been we've developed and inserted into the ramp currently it's unfunded the working on on funding not going forward -- I just wanna give a few of perspectives these are my perspectives not the working group's perspectives in can I I want to commend what I've heard in this room about the at the state of California I think we should be proud that we're leading this charge against the way on trying one issue and and funding this working incredible -- collection of people and this is a west coast problem it's not strictly California it's occurring all over the coast in Oregon Washington we're getting males earned ten with gear from organ washing that are showing up in California I've switch gears I'm thinking about this as a coast Y. problem terms of Krillin for education oceanographic dynamics that's my first point that are being developed either in other states they should look at this working group and -- big fish commend this working group and use it as a basis for developing other risk assessment programs bringing an ecosystem science helps defuse roadblocks among stakeholders that sets three sets everything gives everything a nice common ground I want to personally say that I feel that the scientific community fails to get this message out to the stakeholders our collection of science as we knew we saw the blob we knew that we start to see all the normal stuff happened we knew that compared to previous years another el Nino's we knew that porridge and krill was going to tank but we can get that message out the only came down to when I met with fishermen this because this issue I realize how serious it was to communicate science so -- so that third point about the science and Fisher engagement is absolutely critical for minimizing Valentine women's in the future -- I personally change by chase problems that I want to get involved in or I choose not to get in problems but the methylation ships that I built with this working group has -- been incredible and though the fishermen are key observers for whaling forage and then under surveyed winter season we know very little about what's going on during the winter when they are out there fishing so I just want to commend the fishermen on this group and the time and energy than the communications I thought about what to the one good one last thing I'd like to share is a little bit about reach I've been developing expands and demonstrates how this is not just a California problem but this is a west coast regional problem and this is a summary of the ocean and forage factors in geographic space so we can be digested and examined by the public and they can see the various -- factors in questions that we track for ocean foraging conditions and really just highlights that on very unprecedented -- ecosystem stress test that we went through in twenty fifteen and twenty sixteen we can see these events coming now since we've developed the processes underlying them and perhaps we might be able to model them in the future but you know we need more resources to develop those syntheses and we need to know that the wells in the crawl the fortress they don't respect the boundaries of the of the state of California they move throughout this entire California current large marine ecosystem so just wanted to give it up that this with this will put about reach that we recently really nice job thank you very much -- a grateful for your perspective eight you said that that others have been doing the NSL but you were able to bring that all down the and educate out so just once a thank you so much for all your work looking for work with you here as we move forward we're not gonna be bringing for talking master from the barn a program manager -- California proposition wildlife he's gonna be focusing on the ramp process and what the future holds -- in really what tools we could use better predict the risk of entanglement in what actually should be taking it easy Sir your five minutes I thank you good afternoon thanks for inviting me and thanks for all the panels that have helped us explain what we think is our path to the success and I also I can we really want to take advantage of the questions I heard already today from both occur McGuire which is where do we go from here you've heard quite a bit about the ramp content in terms of membership in the basic tools -- but how's it actually going to work and what do we still need to understand so the fundamentals are as we need gear that's doesn't catch whales that that's a goal we don't have that the other of course in till that happens or if it happens the others avoiding co occurrence or extreme co currents of gear and Wales the good news on the gear front we have a lot of very smart fishermen scientists engineers and biologists working on trying to figure out here that won't catch while -- we're not there yet nobody's figure that out -- but I will say about the gear solution -- it's easy to technically come up with a solution it's a whole nother thing to come up with a solution that what I say fishes eighty it's economically viable for the fisherman to use and doesn't create other unintended consequences so -- it's it's a lot harder than it sounds the other is a co current you heard quite a bit about predicting whale behavior but there's other half of this that is equally as complex and hard to get out its understanding fishermen their complex group we have very many and many different business models and approaches to risk and fishing practices so for us to really get this car currents we have to spend more time understanding our fishermen how they make decisions about how much gear they face how long the fishing where the fish and the things that influence at price abundance là mÙt cast said it sounds obvious but one thing I've learned working with a fisherman it's not obvious cam so we're gonna spend a need to spend more time really understanding that and that's critical not only for predicting that undesirable coal currency but if we are seeing in project in a co occurrence what are we actually going to do to reduce that risk ultimately -- can I tell Fishman will just move your gear can actually do that how much time does it take to move back here does it is influenced by the size of their operation the size their permit a do they have to move five hundred potter wonder pot does that change from beginning the season to the end of the scene so it's a complex dynamic that were only just now starting to work on but we will be working on a quite a bit getting inside their heads and figure out a way to really better project how they will react both in time and space when we have a project in the current goal currents because if you for this ramp to work core the ramp is to assess and predict a KO currents and then make recommendations to the director to avoid tobacco currents and therefore eliminate or reduce the risk of well tangle but we have to know how the fishermen are going to react the wells are gonna do their things because last time I talked to him they did not listen to me at all -- I'm not sure the fishermen well but worth that's the part we have the best hope for -- so to the ramp operation as you heard we piloted this is our second pilot year were work in a voluntary basis trying to work the bugs out of the system identify the weaknesses as I just mentioned fishermen behaviors and one of the weaknesses we identified were working on -- the other of course you heard your marking men's that are confirmed an identifiable to the fishery are to Dungeness crab and that's because they're they're the most predominant in terms of gear but they're also the one that's mark -- duty -- center Maguire's wisdom he introduced legislation we will be requiring all fixed gear to have some unique identifying markings so that when we do get entanglement we are able to trace at least to the fishery and so when our source solution addresses the actual problem and not just a symptom that's going to be critical be looking at is improving that turn around time on our information so -- the agencies monitor information that's coming in we're developing more -- data streams including fishermen we started and tested last year -- text groups I'm not a really technical savvy person I'm learning a lot from the fishermen where we farm groups and they Texas live information of what they're seeing on the water where they're seeing it behavior the whales how much gear on the way in on the train here this morning I got tax from fish missing his not much gear here that's kind of strange where they're pretty go so that it turns out to be very valuable last year we had a report of an enormous number of well citing tough Monterey right before the season right around that you back two minutes that caused us great concern we checked with the fishermen through this tax single will were not seen the whales so that causes to investigate further than the were in close to shore the whales were way off shore no Kirk CO a current and we were relieved so that's the kind of dynamics this group's gonna have to work with and then you know Hey we don't have to but at some point where we realize we have an an act unacceptable event that's about to occur we have to have a mechanism to both communicate to the fleet a you need to do this in this amount of time and then have some way to make sure they can actually accomplish that or provide assistance for them to be able to do that so those are kind of the things were working on going forward is actually to be able to implement and see results through the system and I'll available for any questions you might have very grateful for all your work in the even at this many years in we so appreciate so keep thank you very much for being here today it's always good to see will be asking questions here just a bit we're grateful to Dr Jeff masters here he's the captain program director for Oceania he's gonna be addressing his experience with the working group process including some options in regards to future work and potential studies as well Jeff's could you see Sir for Georgia five minutes a very much Chen McGuire -- vice chair stone it's really an honor to be here thank you for the invitation with them by the way a at fish team tap I had to I got my crap socks on to all right Hey we got your own their doubts -- so I'm I'm gonna talk today on behalf of -- Oceania as well as -- my my -- colleague -- Andre trees worth justice is also on the working group -- representing the organization that whales and the marine by our environment are important of the people of California and one of the things that makes me so excited to be on the working group is that we have a shared vision of both thriving marine life and thriving fisheries I love the crab and want to see that just just as much as I want to see you healthy Wales so I think that we're not none of us want to see these animals entangled in our waters and similar the value the Pacific leatherback sea turtle California state marine reptile is critically endangered and in the Klein and also risk of entanglement so today I'm gonna be discussing some highlights from the working group's recent twenty eighteen nineteen recommendations and also provide a brief overview of some gear innovation testing was fishing gear that the I've been involved with -- first on behalf of the conservation community we're very grateful to the legislature for passing SB thirteen oh nine which led by center McGuire providing the department with authority and direction to implement this rant program we've been talking about as well as for that a seven point five million in in general funds to assist the OPC in finding solutions we really commend the the crab fleet for really stepping up and recognizing this issue the Dungeness crab task force in the department and the the members that have dedicated their time in the working group towards really solving a very difficult problem and and building trust and partnership together including the new regulations on surface gear that the department just implemented as well as the commitment that was announced today by the apart department really made some strides in understanding this we have spent hours going through the data on this in trying to understand the science that the doctors and torrent others have brought to us and we really want to ensure that all the separate results in an effective program so the last three years of of our deliberations is really -- developed what we consider to be a very solid framework to begin addressing this problem and so I wanted to highlight areas so what we on the on the crowd on the on the solutions whole new number of of areas that have have really been forward with this and I'm gonna jump actually to the next -- slide here one of the first key questions we have to ask getting to solve these issue of of co occurrence of the year is where the whales in the turtles and the gear actually at and so this is an example -- picture of a of a -- aerial survey results that shows -- what's on he was actually just talking about where you could see the whales in relation to wear the gear is and evaluate whether there is co occurrence or not and where it might be -- the working group is recommended expanding these aerial and vessel surveys conducting more the forge analysis -- it's connecting tagging studies of the whales using well watching data developing predictive models partnering with the U. S. Coast Guard and then also expanding the -- the use of these solar data loggers and and really the many of these have yet to be funded and the working group has requested the OPC fund this work one being -- the solar data loggers -- that has been done these basically track fishing vessel locations are being set while protecting protecting the confidential proprietary individual in the beginning information -- so this was recently -- expanded based on a recommendation and the OPC recently did fund this work and we -- -- as a conservation communities do this is a step on the right direction I would encourage the state to move toward a goal of a hundred percent -- data logger coverage across all its fix your fisheries this is something that is going to have an about major pay offs in understanding the fishing dynamics -- and also understanding how to better enforce and fine tune regulations as well as with the effects of any regulations we might put in might be -- regarding -- the next kind of piece of this and the gear innovations front the working group represent recommended the open ocean protection council work with the Pacific states marine fisheries commission to develop a cure innovations review -- and evaluation process while supporting it of Asian projects that might be ready to go this season of so I'm in a skip to the next slide here -- today of the talk about a type of your innovation known as roll bliss -- fishing gear so right now one thing that we do know is one sure way to lower risk is to reduce the number of vertical lines in the water this either means closing specific areas during periods of high risk for using technologies -- that actually might allow continued fishing without the vertical lines and this we believe is the promise of reckless here we're not asking you today to require real click here at this time as an alternative but would really like your support in further testing to see if we can turn this into a viable solution in the future -- so this technology has been used for decades in the scientific and defence sectors -- they've been proven to reliably locate retrieving communicate with underwater equipment using acoustic release devices and modems and while applying these mature technologies to fishing year -- will require more are in the efforts we must remember we can go from the model T. to the test le overnight California is famous for its innovation just look at Silicon Valley and the legislature can really play a key role in supporting the innovation process and developing this type in New new technology next slide please we've we've actually already conducted some proof of concept tests -- with three California Dungeness crab fishermen -- summer here are in the room including a deck here on the panel I am take valuable information on how to modify these existing systems to work better on private schools -- we also can be in a meeting with the marine mammal commission to talk about further testing -- plans for this upcoming fishing season and multiple fisherman now have expressed interest in participating in a full operational pilot test program over an extended period to work toward making this robust year more of a fully operational the challenges identified thus far such is fully developing a shipboard operations making the systems more affordable on a larger scale addressing concerns over Ocean noise and enabling enforcement of trap fisheries that don't have a service but we give that to me right -- I presented a some of this work -- recently at the rogue was kind I'm in new Bedford Massachusetts attended by over a hundred fifty -- fishermen scientists and government agencies and this effort is gaining momentum so gear manufactures and fishermen are are seeking financial support and next slide please pursue testing this current season this is a photo of some of the testing -- that that was on you can see the the movie being that there after a successful release -- next slide please -- this is -- in the words of a caller dialing one of the fishermen -- feel who has great potential for being beneficial used to the for the fishery and trap issues around the world including mitigation well integument and more thorough technology for should be the next step next line so in terms of what we're trying to do basically seek funding to actually get this -- gear on the water this coming season -- and also -- we were hoping that the -- ocean protection council we can work with the department to develop a longer term a robust testing a comprehensive program for the future of go ahead next line -- and so what the other last recommendation wanted to highlight from the working group is that the ramp currently -- only addresses the Dungeness crab fishery and is really primarily focus on humpback whales and so one of the recommendations is to really expand the scope of this discussion all the commercial and recreational fix your fisheries that use vertical lines this will require action by the fish and game commission that apartment the legislature and California's work in the federal Pacific fishery management council and this discussion also needs to move beyond just humpback whales the working group is record recommended moving out to blue whales -- and there and and and and the other species that are subject to entanglements so in summary we're really encouraged by the progress that has been made just next slide some of the testing -- we were a part of this is really been an exciting for -- thing for me personally and professionally I really -- -- built some great relationships with some of the people on this committee -- and -- and I think that if we can -- didn't didn't have a science driven framework for a solution and and make further investments in the day a collection development of these new technologies and expansion of the ramp framework to all the fisheries I think we are are on the verge of having a a solution and it's great to go first as a state it's it makes me proud to live here thank you so much Jeff thank you so much and have some questions on that -- and some of the -- cordless aye traps as well so happening coming up in just a bit and it is our pleasure to be able entities Mister Augie's commercial fishermen religion here in California he's in cover the fisherman's perspective -- a and I gotta say the fleet came to us in two thousand fifteen proactively to be to say we have to be a change the dynamic on the ocean as one take a moment say thank you to the fleet -- very few industries that would say come regulate is I a and do it quickly and I just want to say on behalf of the committee thank you miss rob -- for bring that forward along with that the rest of the fleet you're gonna be a focusing on education outrage the fleet -- as well as -- all the different meetings have been happening to gear modifications even advancing the floor is yours yet by Sir okay -- my name is Dick log in -- I'm a commercial fisherman from the day today I have the fishing vessel carrying gene and I like to take a couple seconds in -- new tell you that I've been on the working group now for the last couple of years and -- you feel very very lucky to be able to participate with them and work from that point one of the things that comes to mind initially is one of the things that the -- the working group put together was but a best practices guide that was -- distributed through the fleet and help to -- take a look at line school -- excessive line service secure and -- kind of recommended what we felt was of an appropriate way to fish -- it it it decrease the amount of excess line it was on service and and of hopefully opportunity for entanglement with with the -- whales the the end product -- I I I feel was that that made the fisherman it helped the fishermen be more wear and the help is fish responsibly and I feel like that's a very strong and definite direction that we need to continue -- allows been said about the solar loggers I'm just trying to -- -- -- quickly as possible the soul soul loggers we I've had as a little girl my vessel for the last two years it's -- it's a great product -- it doesn't require any -- wiring and some simple it works of a cell signal as we enter into the service area where can transmit it immediately transmits the location and the information vessel as as -- -- eight tracks the vessel and then transmitted information I feel like it's a of a very viable of -- solution for indicating three dynamics and of location and effort shift in all the things that are important to of the ramp program and -- the other things that we're testing or are like a weak link type devices which are -- of one of our are working group members actually is working with the view degradable line -- the idea behind this would be to have the plot fall off of the wheel if possible if it does get entangled and therefore you know if the line is degree double and it's on the -- animal for a period of time you can break fall away and take the stress of the the creature and allow the this entanglement group to potentially come up in disentangle the animal easier without the stress of the -- part on the bottom there we've also -- been given some of the sleeve devices from back east device and of the best thing about that would be is that I didn't have to splice the line all the time and put put these notes in here reached here if I can avoid that I'd love to be able to do that but at the the sleep devices similar to that -- okay describe is like a Chinese finger deal the little puzzle you put your fingers in there you can't fully figures out well that that slides over the into the ropes we read that into the world and windows is an excessive amount of stress put on that that -- that wrote the rope will break and I've tried it the house I've worked with my trucks and pulled on and it does break in and and it and it holds very very well the idea behind this would be to keep it up in the upper ten fathoms of of rope and then you know that's apparently or that's where we feel them the most in in that way that will is entangled the most is on the upper end of the crab here so if in fact we were able to utilize a breakaway of some type at the at the it would it would it would help the animal from being injured as much -- about two minutes to open I'm sorry it too many all okay -- I have a as a as Jeff is as we mentioned -- you know I've worked with the public Louise -- there's a awful lot to be they need they need to work a lot on that it's it's it's not real practical -- for the fishery at this point I believe that it it maybe later on -- I'm more than willing to try to work with it but -- at this point it's just not something that we can utilize efficiently in the in the fishery -- we've also done care testing with a GPS grease which eight eight eight indicates when we lost year or cure gets out of line and we'd be able to for find it on a chart plotters that as another technology that's coming around -- it also would allow us to follow the wheel efficiently if infected to get tangled and rather than having to keep it inside include followed on a chart and be able to see it from you know utilizing GPS accordance is -- the main thing I'd like to be able to emphasize is the effort that the fishermen have made to recover lost here and not to of the move the vertical lines from the water of with the support from center McGuire -- we I I'm I'm sure this is going to improve and did these efforts of a crackpot recovery had it up in if the if they have been around for quite awhile we've we've gone up we've gone out of her way to make sure that we bring is gearing so -- want one thing I just would like to leave you with is that you know -- you've got some really innovative minds out here the fishermen are incredibly intelligent and and I mean I I I highly respect their their efforts and energy to try to mitigate these issues so please reach out to us and and and thank you for your support think so much Mister operate for your here thank you for all your work and then also -- tested at the different pieces of equipment as well as so important being able to go out the field next to see how they work thank you so much thank you to turn over the vice chair of any questions comments or if you come some of the things that that I'm hearing in in part of it I do so my questions before about the case of a tangle mania where were fining tangle but really all goes back to the science the data collection and building professors you really talked about ultimately we can start to figure this out in California but if we don't view it as a west coast problem then we're not going to be finding the the real long term solutions and indicates you said the we we we can talk about gear we can talk about science but proving it on the ground so that something is fissionable that solutions are are realistic and part of that is the credibility that's built by the science by the data collection and having the ramp and in the end the coalition's the passports of really being able to bring the stakeholders together and and have this conversation so I see that we've been making a lot of progress but I think we're really also pointing out where we have some gaps in the data gaps in funding gaps in in would be able to bring science to bear so that we can we can continue these conversations but then inevitably expand -- up the coast where we're gonna need to bring in other states eventually we will have with the west coast federal partners and think are proving to be fruitful is because federal partners not so much time will sort of hopefully sort that out but it's a big issue and it's it's amazing to hear about the strides that making but it also is a the the areas where we really need to be putting more into think that's why these kids here is a very helpful and keeping the committee very well connected to what's working and what's not working is hopefully if one of we can bring nothing else to bear but some of the resources of the the capacity that you're going to need to be able to answer this question that some that were very interested in like things like GPS the cost of those are coming down and putting those of bullies is something that's that's really very feasible but yet it's an additional cost sufficient itself we're interested in that and I think we need to come up with funding mechanisms to be able to sure that we're getting the solution out ground tested and really understand the feasibility but that's one thing to that that if you can track that year you'll be able to see for the quickly that it's been a table because it's moving in a way that it should be moving and so with that those kinds of early morning in a sort of back to the the questions about how long that that will had been entangled in the damage the gets done over time the sooner we can identify that a PC gears moving forward should be moving back to the front of the building we go five back close to the origin and not have to wait until it so much further down the coast where to do it has a dam is that it is so those are the kinds of things that we should be paying attention to but again it's resources and it's testing things out to to a point where it becomes workable side not necessarily for here but I would be very interested to know because doctor says you very interesting you saying that that the robust years really putting out to be viable but from the fishermen stable interest but not necessarily officials at this point does the gaps that that we've gotta close it may be able to establish a lot more so I mean I'm just if you're a capsule a kind of the kinds of things that are working with the technologies that have been with the intensity of the interesting the things that I'd like to say is that you know we need to be sure that any of these devices that we're working on our of one number number one cost effective and number two or something as simple that the fishermen can put together in utilized immediately it's it's very very difficult to begin to we invent the wheel and have have let's try to put something together that just is very difficult to operate with or with or equipment we've got is a way that we do this and it's very efficient and -- I you know I want to make sure that whatever we were doing doesn't in able impact is financially that mean significantly you know we've already gone through group changing we tried to of a lemonade floating lines we tried to go to neutral wanted sinks keep these lines tie -- we're doing a lot of things to try that are simple not very not very expensive for the fishermen and that's extremely important because we're we're we're basically struggling now as it is and and to impact is more financially that's a that's a tough one for all for the whole three okay yeah so copies -- cost year compatibility with which you have on the boat versus what's in the water that's great yeah that's it okay died I understand that come and then the a lot better -- thank you this is always been very informative and I think we're really laying out the past as well as the continuing challenge that we have in order to be able to solve this problem but I do agree starting to look more west coast rather than just California thank you thinks which is fresher would like to talk about the events -- could you see what we saw two thousand fifteen more frequently occurring and then I also want talk about modeling so we looked at September October is the peak this year -- in regards to the mall cash said then we started to see it simmer down -- here as we approach the end of the year is that something that folks saw what we need to be a to do to be you have a better prediction model -- as we move for I think you're getting very good advice on the demo casted from professor Cannella and about this this coming season is -- the north Pacific is anomalously warm this this this one this one and that's concerning and some have -- suggested that we might see the return of a small warm blog this winter many for the Michael and that that that does happen we would see persistent demo castle and reduction of up Welling reduction of our normal porridge community that we have regarding long term outlook that upwelling intensity is going to increase with global warming and I think there's number studies now that have -- demonstrated that in fact that has happened over the last four four decades -- but the thing that I'm most concerned with up Welling we we can have with all the changes and wins and that it can be destabilizing could remove the typical forage base of creel in rock fishing things and moving off shore and so we can actually be detrimental to our ecosystem that we have dependent on and one of the biggest concerns that I've tried to highlight is that with increased -- ocean warming Kering off shore wonder things that we're expecting to happen is that the cold water habitat is going to be compressed closer to short as can be we might have good up willing but only be a tiny sliver and that's when we run into problems when the predators that typically live out in the open ocean the large cetaceans and other sea birds when they can't find food they're coming on to the shelf that puts them into direct interaction with humans papers so that that that's sort of a long term perspective that we think we're gonna see more -- frequent heat waves of rain heatwaves right and lack of and reduction of up Welling habitat one California coast in your seen this in other areas of the plan as well yes yeah you can law you can do a search for large marine heat waves there's actually a really nice -- website that makes predictions it's not a matter of time there it is there's heat waves right now all over the earth and they have a as we've learned here in California they have drastic impacts on our social economic conditions absolutely would you characterize the event in a to -- so we're coming out of that the worst drought California's had twelve hundred years how would you describe the event in two thousand fifteen unprecedented we have never seen that before and here you got to keep in mind that the long term record of of observations of global temperature at that are a reliable -- coming from ship based measurements and stuff like that it's only about a hundred years of our a record -- sure we have other information that goes back in with high scores another sentiment coursing things but in terms of the the destabilizing affect at that emergence of the blob in el Nino in twenty fifteen twenty sixteen we've never seen anything like that before and earlier comment was that you know California's one of the highest bio diversity places and and the state in the country -- in things that kept us off very early was extreme biodiversity positive anomalies in the open ocean coming from subtropical as were cut week we saw the first tropical is ation of bands that we that we never see we've had species we were caught in the long term troll surveys that I work with and especially surveys over thirty years we've never seen this species composition before had critters are coming from the south and further offshore and the pirates arms or another another great example that nots those of those larger see -- I see tackle things of the Washington beach yeah yeah we've never seen this change I think we had a squid harvest up in -- crescent city -- which was just a unbelievable yeah yeah it was an eco system stress test driven by climate change that we've never seen before and -- I hope we don't see more frequent events but it's it's likely that we will it's not a matter of if it's one to be able to pull a -- for fisheries because I think that the peace Lara times in my issues come down the price right -- so what is it gonna take to be able to mass produce something that is reliable and how many years out are we sell two part question number one how far out are we because at field testing right obviously this is more work to be done is heard from doing any to what is going to cost to be able to look at a reliable alternative to see Dr -- takes at the end for the question and I've I've in some of the other -- other fisheries where you've seen these kind of new innovations pop up for example like deep set do we gear which started as basically a concept or a hypothesis that was promising and involved from proof of concept tests to expansion to you know now we're looking authorization of that as it is an allowable fishing fisheries so I would see if a similar process here I mean we're not saying that this gear is ready to use I mean this this is basically adopting an existing technology that that's out there -- so what we've done is we we put the we put the gear in the water one day right just once -- the next step we would see would be to basically expand that so you give you know five or six fishermen you know a set of these of these movies and basically train them and how to use that we would we would expect that they would be fairly compensated for all of their time and involved in the testing and basically see if they can integrate and make the changes on their boat to make it work right if it doesn't fish I thought you said -- there's no point in even talking about cost and all the other -- issues there so I think the the what I I could see in terms of a a time line -- you know -- the the more kind of scaled up pilot you get this year fish then what you see what you have is the basic you know that the scaling up of technology you know that the first you know DVD player with cost about ten thousand dollars right when it first came out you go buy one for less than fifty Bucks today so that it really it depends on the of the time the amount that that the -- they can work with the fishermen -- to figure out changes to the system to use you know less expensive tech technologies but ultimately -- we would hope that that -- if that really does prove to be a solution that there would be -- some partnership some subsidy types of efforts because it is in everyone's best interest to actually -- see this if it's a solution so it's got promise out there if it works this could be the holy grail silver bullet we're not saying it is yet we're not convinced yet but what we've seen so far is it's got potential and and we like to try to take the next step no thank you so yeah I would just like that because it there's along with that -- the member the fifth the flea has two problems Wales and demo Cassie and one of things were really interested is learning to see if we can adapt and make this fleet nimble enough to fish around both of those problems north I see a future along with gear innovation where the fisherman's able to know exactly we have them on the data monitoring needed to know where to more gas it is a problem where the whales are and they are able to fish around those problems as an alternative or a second way to deal with it because it's not just one problem may name a bill solve the whales but if they can't sell the crowd there also in trouble so there's a synergy here that that we're looking at is nimble this technology monitoring predictive tools to kind of make this a very -- adaptive fleet going in the future don't think things myself is about sharing meals for say thank you to our entire panel very very grateful for all the work with the group is well in very valuable lessons learned here today thank you so much there isn't Chen we really appreciate you hanging with us -- al afternoon in again thank you so much the query him for all of their work we're now gonna be moving on to our last panel this is gonna be litigation update on all issues related to well tank commencing fishing gear we're gonna invite Christian Monsell to be a to come for for the cheesy Ocean program litigation director also known as the senior attorney -- for the center for biological diversity for also can invite no up and I back up the ticket director for the Pacific coast federation of fishermen's association I'm here's how it's going to work -- Kristen is going to be presenting her perspective now is going to be presenting his perspective -- each will have five minutes and we're grateful to both you for being here today then obviously we'll open it up for questions from the committee as well after both a Christian NO a finish up we're gonna open up for public comment -- a we do invite you to stick around for oysters and crab right after this but without that further do the turn of the Christian you have the floor you five minutes in our it's causing him to be governor sizer we can do for her I can I can do it okay Hey that it's working the floor is yours thank you so much thank you so much time to that to the chair and members of the committee and the staff for organizing this this hearing and inviting me to to speak and all the work that you've been doing to to address this issue and as you as you know in my name is Chris my cell and I am those and legal director at the center for biological diversity and will be giving a brief overview of the the lawsuit that we we brought -- and though the law under underlying that that lawsuit I'm so as as we all know this is and why it why we're all here today California has a whale entanglement problem we spent a lot of time already talking about the numbers so I won't get into those but as you can see the number of entanglements really started to spike or into the twenty fourteen and have -- in increased on pretty pretty astronomically -- since then you know they have gone down in twenty seventeen but are still well well above the above the average and -- the -- commercial Dungeness crab fishery in California is responsible for the most -- number of entanglements when when the gear type is is now and -- you know why do we care about this there's also been a lot of discussion and with respect to what happens to whales when they got entangled as well as well as the turtles and as we've heard it causes an incredible amount injury is on making kill them because the years that we have the -- and it can also prevent them from feeding -- or prevent them from being able to reproduce in the future because of the the straps and the amount of energy they they expand when they are entangled -- and it's also a huge conservation concern you're talking about humpback whales blue whales and Pacific Pacific leatherback sea turtle all of which are listed as a threatened or endangered under the federal Endangered Species Act and a and several of the of the populations are are critically endangered including both leatherback sea turtles but then also there's one population of humpback whales off California that feeds exclusively off California that has just over four hundred members of the population laughs so any entanglement of a member of that population particularly a female really kind have population level impact and may jeopardize the the very survival of of that of that population -- and in addition to being incredibly painful and and deadly there federally protected species are also unlawful on the Endangered Species Act is a federal law that -- sorry about that -- that and seeks to protect that threaten endangered species and ecosystems on which they rely and has been noted has the most comprehensive legislation for the protection of endangered animals ever enacted by any any nation and the plane intent of Congress was to reverse I the trend of species extinction nope no matter the costs and one of the most important ways that the act does that is through section nine of the statute which makes it unlawful for any person to take an endangered species or to cause such a take to be committed -- ghost take and the person are defined very broadly under the statute take is essentially defined as any act that can harm or wound or caps or or otherwise just rob -- essential behavioral patterns like feeding breeding -- and to kill them and and and under under the statute it -- you not just individual people that are prohibited from causing take but also -- government entities Richard of that are considered a person under under the statute so if you had a government entities such as a state that is permitting an activity that leads to entanglements or takes of whales and sea turtles that is unlawful and -- that this is all the basis of a lawsuit that we filed here in the Northern District in San Francisco in October of of twenty seventeen and we filed it against the department of fish and wildlife and we have one claim in the Los view that the state's permitted permitting and management of the commercial Dungeness crab fishery is harming killing tangling up and otherwise causing Tate of leatherback sea turtles blue whales and and humpback whales and that that's a violation of of the stats you to me okay I'm almost -- and -- V. speaking in in the lawsuit is for the the state to get a permit from from the federal government while take is generally prohibited under the statute there is an exception within the statute by which the federal government can a permit to take incidental to an otherwise unlawful activity provided certain conditions are met and that there is a plan to mitigate the impact of that take on on that the printer endangered species and were also seeking a media many mitigation measures to significantly reduce the risk of of entanglement and fantasize -- immediate here because there's there's been a lot of talk about twenty fifteen and twenty sixteen and the high number of entanglements that we saw there and we are we are very very concerned about this upcoming season given not there's lots of of six signals that we may see -- another -- another year of bad entanglements for Wales and the department absolutely needs to do everything in its power to have a plan in place to to ensure that more whales and sea turtles Dahle die these incredibly painful verbal gaffes and in entanglement in fishing gear -- any in terms of the status of the of the litigation -- were and we're actively briefing at the -- the merits of the the case right now time we filed our opening brief the the end of October the department just filed its brief -- along with PC FFA hood intervened as defendants in lawsuits -- aye and Wednesday of of last week -- and we have a brief DO in a couple weeks and then reply and then we have an oral argument currently scheduled for the for the beginning of affect your eight year the judgment and for the court to determine the liability this was a thank you so much Christian noted all trying to be pushy -- I just wanna make sure that we give equal time I mean today so I just I'm very grateful thank you so much we're gonna hang with us so we can ask any questions as well if you don't mind return over and no oftentimes with the music check attracted specific because federation official so she should I should have been of this about seven minutes and so will I will double the units back from a crab feast for nearly that long Senate we were talking please note for two hours so -- no Oppenheim executive director of the Pacific coast federation of fishermen's associations -- I'll pick up right where miss months a left off -- as you mentioned organization is defendant intervenor in the case on the side of the department of fish and wildlife in CVV bottom -- and as month miss once also mentioned currently we are in the process of -- of educating a hearing -- with motions for summary judgment having that filed by the center for biological diversity -- just a brief update followed by what I met what I view as a vision for haves forward both with respect to litigation in the working group we've heard so much about today -- so PC of a file the response motion which essentially -- supports the department of fish and wildlife's opposition on facts and on their motion for -- their cross motion for summary judgment -- we are not taking a position on the legal jurisdictional side the section nine take a liability side per se -- we believe that department of fish wildlife is mounting -- a good strong defense on jurisdictional and summary judgment process issues and we would join them in that defense -- there are some facts at issue in the case that will be discussed at the hearing but what's not in dispute at all is the fact that there is a problem in this fishery there is also no dispute that the solution needs to be one that works for commercial fishermen on the water I personally believe that Senate bill thirteen oh nine thank you for your leadership Senate required is the path forward for that -- I believe that it indeed satisfies the plea that CVD brings in this case that we take immediate and meaningful steps to ensure that the risk of entanglement of large marine mammals industries minimize the ramp in the working group will do this with commercial fishermen with environmental organizations state and federal agency staff scientists disentangle next birds at the table working together to insure that it's done equitably expeditiously fairly and permanently in other words of a process that will work I have extreme confidence in folks like Dick agri heard from John Miller is also in the room Jim Anderson also in the room -- for members of the working group to both make sure that what we develop is going to work on the water and that their colleagues in the industry understand that this is the right path to take and we will be doing a lot of work -- organization are colleagues etcetera to -- to discuss this issue to make sure that fishermen understand that this is not only a progressive process that will ensure they are at the table but that it is a process that will ensure they will be able to like director Bonham said fish crap forever because that's our ultimate goal and I think it's the one that shared by the vast vast majority of people who are engaged in this process so -- I'll just conclude by saying that the Senate bill thirteen oh nine framework creating a process an interim process to bring us to regulatory implementation of the ramp is equitable it's fair the criteria for that interview process or spelled out plainly in your bill senator and greatly appreciate the fact that those criteria will make this work at a workable they will make them clear transparent they will protect safety of life at sea the fisheries self and ensure above all most importantly that we are able to protect large remember -- we will get through this we will weather the storm and we will come out stronger for it so thank you thank you so much Chau very grateful would like to be turned over to vice chair to basically questions or comments please really it's difficult for us to comment on on existing litigation but I think it's the weather regardless the outcome of the lawsuit public pressure and sort of the court of public opinion is starting to weigh in more and more significantly more well it tackles we see if we do see an uptick it will take a look I think that's more pressure on us on everyone in this room to seek solutions not in the next three to five years but solutions and that's really what what we're trying to engage here push the industry push the technology push all the stakeholders and make sure that we're looking at Bible solutions on the shortest possible time right to reduce so the horrific things that we see we get the more we understand those interaction the more we understand the data the science so that we can help direct solutions the better off that we're going to be so dependent a lawsuit that's gonna drive changes faster but I would hope we would all feel that if it is in the need for looking for solutions as soon as we can because what's at stake is really cute and it's not just for California than the lawsuit is gonna direct this board with California's solutions but it is a west coast challenge it's a much broader challenges we seem to be finding ourselves whether it's a climate any number of areas engaged in and solutions that are beyond just California by the west coast but even internationals we look at the ocean acidification and other changes that are that are going on so this is I think a right time for us to be having these discussions looking for solutions and you have to sort out that lawsuit in the District Court will sort that out for the meantime we still have our work cut out thank you Mister vice chair I think my only comment to be this is that -- know that all sides are talking -- which I think is the best way to go to find a solution -- I actually think that there are common goals -- from all sides -- and there may be some different paths to get their -- when I'm open is that we're gonna be able to -- all move forward eventually together I do have to say I think that -- where CVD has been -- wanting to the state data will put words in your mouth -- but at the nay particular that take permits I think that is an important first step -- above and beyond what is already been happening with -- legislative solution solution I think we need to be able to continue to invest in resources and moving with our federal partners I to be able to afford on that take for me three pronged approach again I am not gonna waited to the matters that are at hand of both sides -- take a look for any closing comments alternate over to -- first since -- recent start with sort of analytical street Christopher political certainly thank you senator -- briefly I what we heard from director Bonham today without launching into a a path forward a solution may include the take the application for an is nothing for me get I believe that with the state being in the driver's seat that effort -- I want speaker CVD in this case but certainly from our perspective it is far more favorable to be able to be full participants in that application process having the confidence to know that having worked with the state they want the commercial fishery to be part of this process and I think it we've heard it from the feds we've heard it from the state certainly from scientists and folks who work at the working group at the working group is a superior option that it is the format by which in this fishery in potential in the west coast regionally we will best be able to address these challenges so I I think I'm curious to see next steps in the process but it you know at this point I'm confident in the state's strategy here and -- we look forward to working with our friends and see if that we on this of selling a lot more work to come percent thank you and yeah and I don't have much more to to add but I I I would note that we do see promise in in the in the ramp program but we do you really want to see science bees management measures that significantly reduce the risk of entanglement and do so very quickly it's unfortunate that we're now talking about this the end of of twenty eighteen when we were first raising this issue and in twenty eight twenty fourteen and that the amount of time it's taken us to get to to this point it's been too long particularly when you're talking about the populations that we are the wheels just don't have time to wait nor nor should pay the state really has a legal and moral obligation to step up and really make some significant changes but also a great opportunity to do so as has been reiterated today several times thank you so like you very very grateful thank you for your comments thank you both for being here truly appreciate your work and know that there's more to come on this one thank you so much both you not to be moving on to public comment we're gonna invite anyone and everyone to be able to come up and offer any public comment -- here if you could step up to the microphone here two minutes okay the wind is given is your first name in your organization we welcome you Sir good afternoon chairman and co chair -- my name's James McFarlane I'm with the a marine of Tasmania Australia and I'd like to thank all of the fishers who have gone out and worked with us in the original test programs I'd offer up couple couple starts to go with my written notes -- one is everything you put over the side of the boat is mission driven and those pieces of equipment all have different uses and so reckless gears and the answer by itself GPS tracking by itself is not the answer -- the numbers of entanglements globally are three hundred thousand that's the global number that they're putting forth right now so it's not just a California -- problems like you said we don't have -- boundaries and so forth as the global temperatures change in the ocean the fishing grounds are gonna change server the feeding grounds and so we do have these conflicts between the mammals and and the fishers I mean it's it's of no one no one problem and it's going to keep going on until we find solutions what we would like to -- hope is that we can work together to the system finding solutions for this and offer up the following Jeff -- Chester mentioned in his presentation six bows with five traps each to go into a an operational pilot test program there's two hundred thousand traps off the coast of California annually so we're talking about putting thirty robust gear and to try and find out what the problems are because I heard from a number of presenters that we don't have the data to make -- informed decisions as to what the right way forward is and so -- here would love to help of you and I think that the ongoing conversation between all of the interested parties is in the best interest of the state and that the wheels that are here thank you so much thank you for being here afternoon thank you bring in with this first last name organization thank you again for your time thank you so much member stone for having this wonderful hearing today for low everyone speak my name is Leah Sturgis I'm speaking on behalf of social compassionate legislation and I did the presentation I presented the power point on will and see totaling tangle men at the budget subcommittee where the seven point five million in funds were appropriated to the OPC -- and much of the discussion was focused on funding large larger scale testing a robust gear and other innovations the testimony that day was focused on presenting rebels technology as a solution and the conversation is what prompted the unit unanimous approval of the budget subcommittee so it was really focused on tack in science doubt that the best solution here will come from science and technology technological innovations afters considerable investigation into this issue I feel conceptually row plus options are the only way to eliminate risk of entanglement and insensitive feeding areas while allowing fishermen to continue to make a living -- I also want to stress the dire situation of the sea turtles are facing we don't get the same price as the whales but their situation is actually more critical and I'd like to urge the committee to make sure that funding be set aside for Scott Benson here at no and moss landing marine laboratories so he can continue to do his necessary serving and tracking of the sea turtles which is incredibly important at this time the circles come all the way from Indonesia to feed in the Monterey Bay so at least we can let them for is there safely thank you so much because which these pretty amazing to think though about their journey right in but it takes absolutely thank you so much we're grateful you're here today please get your first and last and your organization we're grateful you're here shore -- Nicholas Sackett director of legislative affairs for social question legislation as well thinking not just once a simply -- point out that my organizations presentation which was done by Leah on April twenty third in front of the budget sub committee chaired by some members bloom and where assemblymember Tang is an alternate focus solely on -- entanglement issues and the possibility of reducing doesn't hang with with the use of reverse gear and other technologies after a presentation on four twenty three the subcommittee unanimously voted to approve the seven point five million dollars are allocated for him issues on may twenty second we fully understand that those funds were not specifically earmarked for broke with testing but it's important for all the stakeholders including OPC in the working group to understand the spirit in which those funds are allocated -- we believe that the people of California would be disappointed to know that a method by which -- the fishery could thrive with zero entanglements with the use of reckless gear was not at least tested by the state if not outright advocate for PC -- will commit to a robust operational testing plan for next season -- and to make that commitment immediately so that there is time to set up a scientifically operationally sound testing plan thanks thank you so much thank you for your comments today we really appreciate you being here welcome Sir correcting they can bring in with us if you can please give us your first and last name your organization my name is don't complain and I am a commercial fisherman from half moon bay and have been for forty six years it up I would like to thank you for the opportunity to speak here today and I would also like to is it too thank you senator McGuire in the committee for the due diligence that -- you've exhibited towards working two viable solutions to the problems involving demo casted and willing paying with that that still maintain focus on vibrant sustainable fisheries it's it's important to commercial fisherman how important it is to -- to maintain a healthy Ocean for all of its inhabitants in fact I think it's fair to say that we would have we have a little patch of green on all of this when it concerns to the ocean our ocean activities we just keep it well hidden but where the rubber meets the road through -- efforts of Noah and sick before him PC effort say the working group it cetera -- it's it should be clear that when it comes to the rubber meeting the road we've always been the first to step up to the plate and take the necessary steps the leaders to productive full co existence on the ocean with all of its inhabitants thank you thank you so much thank you for coming over today as well retrievals good to see you good afternoon hereby give us your first and last year musician it's good to see you experiment thank you things for the sun -- my name's John Miller I'm a member of the SF traveled owners association yeah also a member of the working group yeah I've been fishing for forty years I started when I was fifteen or so -- I think the the exciting thing about -- you know are working group in this -- ramp program specifically is just the idea that fishermen can be involved in our own governments so it's not like it or coming to you and saying okay give us a solution I think ultimately you know with the aid of technology and -- you know all these innovations and so forth ultimately the solutions out to come from the fishermen's selves because if it doesn't work for us result in a go out of business in your house vision ports with no picture more and you know its -- that's a terrible thing to imagine for so many different reasons so I think it -- you know we're used to a sort of more heavy handed top down style management -- coming from the agencies and stuff and this is completely different so because of that I think you get a lot of by incomplete because it has a lot of credibility with the flea and I think people are gonna try a lot harder and racked their brains to come up with solutions and to actually see it through and make it work so thank you tell the to taking time Sir in forty years that's fantastic yeah I think thank you very much it's good to see you thanks rainy with this Hey good afternoon ma'am thank you so much for being here if you just give us your first and last organization my first name is Catherine last name is quick were -- a and been working for several months pro bono with a start up company in Halifax Nova Scotia that is developing a real close fishing solution with GPS tracking and what I'd like to let you know is that the government of Canada department of fisheries and oceans has provided funding to fishing associations to conduct pilot testing of this and other similar technologies and I I really like that because it's not just come the government funding the company directly but it's funding association to get their members to take the boats out and test equipment and get really good feedback from the fishermen whether it works for them or not it has to work for them and has to fit on the deck the stackable allow them to get the stuff in the water without taking a fishing gloves off and everything else I have to deal with so I think I would like to see of funding solution in California that does something similar piloting through the Fishman says CH thank you very much of a sick you will definitely research that I'm very grateful if you don't mind just giving Mister Wesley your card today that be fantastic sure of three thank you thank you very much for being here thanks for hanging thank you to see if anyone else would like to be able to offer their common their concerns or criticisms into last call for public comment can come on up with up to be out here for me alright I we're gonna bring it back to committee in look for some closing comments from the vice chair just like state thank you chair for convening this and for everyone who came in and spoke to us today time is critical on these issues and for to continue the conversation finding the solutions we headed to your next legislative session thanks so much as vice chair you can ask for a better partner in this in this one say thank you to the vice chair for all as advocacy it is tied for the coast as well with you Sir we also want to say thank you to all of you for being with us -- you of say thank you to our panelists as well Lewis a thank you to Senate media services have been streaming this live as well as our sergeants were here today and would like to read a map out a little bit about -- road map as we move forward in two thousand nineteen within the first quarter of two thousand nineteen we're going to be having hearing on offshore wind there are several projects off the state of California that maybe dancing offshore wind we want to make sure that fisheries are natural resources are protected while also being that the state station needs to will be hosting a hearing on that within the first quarter of two thousand nineteen will be following up on this issue of wailing tangle me as well as ship strikes here in two thousand nineteen as well with the understanding that there is a lady active litigation is being that will be moving forward -- and we're hoping that there's gonna be some type of settlement I do not know anything that you don't know and I don't have a crystal ball hope is that bottom line is this we need to ensure that we're protecting California's majestic well population in to be able to allow the crab fishery to thrive in the years to come I think that we can have both -- in it's gonna take compromise on all sides be able to do so I to better protect that well population as well as a hard working men and women in the fleet and I am confident that we're gonna be able to get there but I do know that there's going to have to be at some additional focus that focus is gonna be detailed in additional funding at the state needs to be able to step up and assist -- not just that hundred thousand dollars and on going -- -- allocation we need to be able to step up on more than a hundred thousand dollars -- every year on well tangle but no that's gonna be budget discussion but more to come number two on the -- department of public health we have to find the department of public health when it comes to testing on that issue we will not get into was cut out of the budget was recommended by the legislature by two years ago on the and incredibly frustrating that said we're gonna be going back at it -- and hope that we can work with the administration to be successful this year for department public health because it was -- it bipolar we find in the department of -- at fish wildlife to we didn't find public health doesn't work when you only find one of the team so that's more of of more to come here out with that again thank you all for taking the time big thank you to Mister Tom was slow for all of his work -- in very grateful for him where is our chief consultant in who is the rock of this committee so very grateful Mister west low also want to say thank you to Carly revision within deal with all logistics as well I think we need to give time and curling around of applause please in -- without further do we are going to invite all of you to enjoy some of the best of California's ocean -- fresh from the Pacific we got oysters and crab so we're gonna be putting about here we encourage you to be able to hang out with us -- and enjoy some fresh sustainable crap as well some oysters -- area and -- the vice chair is going to have a new momentarily I write okay just got awkward so I think you so much everybody and we'll see you -- here in the first part two thousand nineteen thank you to the aquarium of the bay for all of their work in partnership thank you Richard
