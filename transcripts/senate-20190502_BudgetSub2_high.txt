MISTER PORTER CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR CONFIRMATION ON THE SENATE FLOOR TODAY. WE'RE A PLEASED TO HAVE YOU OFFICIALLY ON BOARD. THANK YOU SENATOR WACO SKI -- AND MEMBERS OF THE OF THE COMMITTEE -- TOM PORTER. RECTOR CAL FIRE. I WILL BE PRESENTING -- FIRST ON THE ISSUE NUMBER. NINETEEN ISSUE CONSERVATION CAM. FIVE A REPLACEMENT KITCHEN. THIS REQUEST IS FOR FIVE POINT THREE TWO EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS OF GENERAL FUND. FOR THE CONSTRUCTION PHASE COSTS OF REPLACING. THE KITCHEN AND DINING FACILITY. AT ISSUE CAMP IN TO HIM A COUNTY IT'S A ONE OF OUR CONSERVATION CAMPS. A HUNDRED AND TEN MEMBER CAMP. I AND WAS BUILT IN. NINETEEN FIFTY NINE UNFORTUNATELY THE THE KITCHEN FACILITY BURNED IN JULY OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND WAS A COMPLETE. LOSS SO. WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS REPLACING THAT FACILITY FOR FEEDING OF MEMBERS? OF THE CAMP. LEE AFTER THE FIRE WE WERE FEEDING THEM OUT OF ONE OF OUR M. K. USE OUR MOBILE KITCHEN UNITS THOSE ARE THE ONES WE TAKE OUT THE FIRES. WE NEED TO HAVE THOSE AVAILABLE TO OUT THE FIRES WE DID REPLACE SOME OF THE KITCHEN FACILITIES SO THAT THEY COULD. USE SOME OF THE OTHER BUILDINGS AT THE CAMP -- FOR FOR FEEDING AND DINING -- BUT THAT IS IMPACTING THE USE OF THOSE FACILITIES FOR STAGING OF EQUIPMENT AND AND PERSONNEL -- AS WE MOVE THEM AROUND THE STATE FOR FIRES IN THAT AREA. THAT CAMP HI A NEEDS TO GET BACK TO A NORMAL OPERATIONS -- IT IS KEY TO OUR FORCE MANAGEMENT A WORKING OBJECTIVES IN THE AREA AND WILL HELP US WITH ROOM -- THE REMOVAL OF DEAD AND DYING TREES IN THE SIERRAS. WHEN I'M YOU'VE SEEN THE STAFF REPORT IN THE LA GOES COMMON AND A HUNDRED AND? EIGHTY THOUSAND GALLON. TANK AND THE PUMP STATION ABOUT. APPS WILL BE A DIFFERENT SIZE THAT MAY. REDUCE THE PRICE. POTENTIALLY HAVE A COMMENT ON THAT BECAUSE OUR CELIO. ON THEY'VE SPOTTED THE ISSUES I WANT TO KNOW IF YOU'VE GOT A CHANCE. TO REVIEW IT. WOULD YOU LIKE LA -- TO PRISON FOR NO I WANNA I'M GONNA SAFETY ALEJO WAS. FOR THAT I I I BROUGHT WITH ME. THIS IS THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF TECH SERVICES MIKE DUGGAN AND HE WON TANK SPECIALIST -- YES WE'VE HAD DISCUSSIONS WITH THE LA -- IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND WHEN WE CARE ABOUT. GETTING THE INFORMATION AS FAR AS THE TANK SIZE IT WAS. LATE IN THE PROCESS OF THAT'S HOW IT GOT PUSHED HERE -- WE TALKED WITH THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL'S WELL ON ALTERNATIVE MEANS JUST LIGHTLY TOUCH OUR GOING OVER THE CALCULATIONS TO SEE IF WE CAN. YOUR REDUCTION I RARELY THAT WATER TANK IS -- TO SUPPLY ONLY FIRE WATER DEDICATED FIREWATER FOR THE NEW INSTITUTIONAL MISSION. SO -- I I BELIEVE IN THE LA THOSE COMMENTS -- THAT THERE WASN'T -- AMPLE TIME FOR THE REVIEW OF THAT IMPOSSIBLE REDUCTION AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING INTO AN ACTIVELY. IT WAS THE FIRE PUMP. WAS THAT ANTICIPATED IN THE ORIGINAL BED THAT YOU WERE GOING TO USE THE EXISTING FIRE PUMP AND THAT SAID PETITION ACOSTA. THE COMPLETE REPLACEMENT. WELL MOVING MOVING AT A FEW YEARS AGO -- WE HAD A MINOR CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECT TO INCREASE -- WATER STORAGE AT THE FACILITY BUT THAT WAS -- JUST. GENERAL USE WAS COMBINED SO WE HAD WAR HYDRANTS THROUGHOUT THE FACILITY AND WAS FOR DRINKING WATER -- BECAUSE THIS IS A I DEDICATED -- FIRE REQUIREMENT FOR THAT KITCHEN THE PREVIOUS KITCHEN DIDN'T HAVE SPRINKLERS. SO IN ORDER TO DELIVER THE FIRE FLOW AS WELL IT WAS REQUIRED THAT WE HAD. TO ADD A BOOSTER PUMP FIRE PUMP -- SO IT IS A NECESSITY [inaudible] HOW YOU? THIS COMPUTERS WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE I'M MISTER CHARITIES ARE ALREADY NOTED WE HAVE THREE SOME CONCERNS WITH -- THE PROPOSAL YOU SAW IT THE PROPOSAL FOR FUNDING FOR THE CONSTRUCTION PHASE OF THIS PROJECT. I CAME BEFORE YOU AS PART OF THAT JANUARY PACKET OF PROPOSALS AND AT THE TIME THE COST FOR THE KITCHEN WAS ABOUT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. I WITHIN THE SPAN OF THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS THE COST HAS NOW GONE UP TO OVER ELEVEN MILLION DOLLARS. FOR THE KITCHEN AND THE AND THE PRIMARY COST DRIVER IS THE SCOPE CHANGE TO ADD TO THIS VERY LARGE -- WATER TANK TO SUPPLY A FIRE PROTECTION WATER FOR THE KITCHEN I WHAT WE WOULD KNOW IS THAT TYPICALLY WHEN THE DEPARTMENT MIGHT SEE EYES SIGNIFICANT COST INCREASE -- ESPECIALLY SOMETHING DRIVEN BY A SCOPE CHANGE THAT'S UNEXPECTED AND THEY WOULD TYPICALLY HAVE THE TIME TO KIND OF GO BACK AND FORTH. I'M LOOKING AT OPTIONS TO REDUCE THAT IS THE FULL SCOPE TEENS ARE CHANGE REALLY NECESSARY ARE THERE OTHER WAYS TO MITIGATE THE COST INCREASES OR VALUE ENGINEERING THINGS THAT THEY CAN DO. TO BRING THE COST DOWN BEFORE THEY COME FORWARD TO THE LEGISLATURE REQUESTING FUNDING I'M JUST GIVEN THE TIMING OF WHEN AT THE DEPARTMENT LEARNED ABOUT THIS. AND THEY HAVEN'T HAD THE CHANCE TO DO THAT AND WAS -- SPOKEN TO ALREADY THEY'RE IN THE PROCESS OF STARTING THAT EFFORT. ON IN ORDER TO ENSURE THEY CONTINUE THOSE EFFORTS TO TRY TO MITIGATE THIS COST INCREASE WE WOULD RECOMMEND PROVIDING THE FULL FINDING THAT THEY'RE REQUESTING. ADDING PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE IN THE BUDGET TO MAKE ON THIS AUGMENTATION IN THAT THE SPRING FINANCE LETTER AVAILABLE ONLY AFTER THEY HAVE GONE THROUGH THIS EXERCISE OF TRYING TO MITIGATE THE COST. AND REPORT BACK THROUGH THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE I'M JUST OF THE LEGISLATURE CAN HAVE SOME CONFIDENCE AND COMFORT THAT THEY'RE TAKING ALL THE STEPS TO MITIGATE THE COST INCREASES. GIVEN THAT THIS IS BASICALLY A DOUBLING OF THE COSTA JUST OVER THE LAST THREE MONTHS. I RECALL THE CHAIR WAS HAVING KITTENS AT FIVE POINT. THREE MILLION FOR THE KITCHEN AND TO HIM A COUNTY SO ELEVEN FOUR FOUR IS. A MADE A GIFT FINANCE YOU HAVE ANYTHING ELSE IF YOUR SERVER DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I JUST WANTED TO KNOW THAT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING COLLABORATIVELY WITH THE LA -- ON THE L&lt;c.cyan&gt;G AND LANGUAGE&lt;/c&gt; YOU MAY THINK AND THE PROPOSED NOT -- CLASSIC A CATASTROPHIC DELAY TO THE PROJECT AS IT'S BEEN DISCUSSED [inaudible] MEMBERS [inaudible] SENATE MCGUIRE. THANK YOU SO MUCH TO JUST LOOK. AT THIS IS NOT WHERE THE DIRECTOR WANTED TO GO I WANT THE WORDS IN YOUR MUTH BUT I CANNOT IMAGINE RIGHT BECAUSE THIS IS. WAY ABOVE I BELIEVE AT THE ESTIMATE ON THAT WHERE YOU THOUGHT SO. IT'S A PRETTY EXTREME CASE. I DON'T SEE THIS ALL THE TIME. I WOULD ADD CARE TRIES THIS IS ALSO ISOLATED BUT TALK TO US ABOUT. WORKING WITH THE GS. IN THE DEPARTMENT. IN WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE AS WE MOVE FORWARD. AND AND BECAUSE THIS IS A REALLY BIG SWING FROM WHERE WE ALL THOUGHT WE'D BE AND WHERE WE'RE AT NOW. I THINK THE OTHER CONCERN THAT I HAVE IS VERY SIMILAR CAMP. IS THE CHAIR OF REFERENCE DIFFERENT COUNTY. I DIDN'T NEED THIS AT LARGE RESERVOIR IF YOU WILL UP ON THE GROUNDS SO -- AND I KNOW YOU NEED MORE TIME TO BE ABLE TO WORK THROUGH THIS. I JUST CAN'T IMAGINE FOR FLIPPING KITCHEN THAT WE'RE GONNA I I NEED SOMETHING THIS LARGE JUST MY OWN OPINION AND I'M NOT A PROFESSIONAL BUT WOULD LIKE TO GET A HERE YOUR FEEDBACK ON ALL THE ITEMS. ALONG WITH STATEMENTS AND MAKE. RIGHT -- BEFORE I PASS IT AGAIN TO MIKE DUGGAN -- JUST RELATED TO WHAT WE ARE RETROFITTING AND BUILDING ON TO A VERY OLD FACILITY AS WELL. AND THE THE NEED FOR FIRE WATER -- IS EVIDENT IN THAT KITCHEN BEING GONE -- AND THE FIFTH DINING FACILITY AS WELL AND MORE OF THE FACILITY COULD HAVE GONE WITH IT -- SO -- THIS. WELL WE KNOW WE NEED FIRE WATER I THINK WE'RE WE'RE GOING TO LOOK INTO ALL OF OUR OPTIONS -- IT WE JUST HAVEN'T HAD THE TIME TO DO THAT AND IN MOVING FORWARD -- THIS WILL GIVE US THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT AND MOVE FORWARD SO US THE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS -- RELATED TO THE OTHER CAMP AND FIRE WATER AND I MEAN I THINK THAT TO MY GOODNESS YOU'RE DOING THIS IS A GIANT RESERVOIR -- I WOULD SEEM GET IT IN REGARDS IS A SPECIAL CONDITIONS. THAT THE DIRECTOR JUST MENTION BUT I THINK THIS IS A BIT OVER KILL. I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S OVER KILL AS FAR AS A REQUIREMENT -- EVEN IF YOU'RE GONNA HAVE. MEANS OF GETTING THAT SORT OF WATER STORAGE AND DELIVERY -- WE DIDN'T HAVE THE TIME TO GO THROUGH WITH THE G. S. ON THAT WE HAVE BEEN IN CAMP ENGINE. AND THAT THE NEAREST FIRE STATIONS WITHIN TWO MILES ONE OF OURS PAINS CREEK -- THAT SHOULD REDUCE THE VOLUME -- IN A PREVIOUS FIRE -- THEY DRAFTED OUT OF THE CREEK THAT RUNS THROUGH CAMP THAT'S A WATER SOURCE AS WELL -- WE'RE STILL GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE DECADE FIREWATER BUT WHAT WE'RE HOPING TO DO IS LOOK AT ALL THE ALTERNATIVE MEANS TO TO ADDRESS WHAT THAT THE CODE IS. IN IN WHEN I SAY OVER KILL IS THE THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE THE TANK RIGHT BECAUSE HE AS YOU JUST MENTIONED. YOU HAD A IN IS IT A WATER TENDER IS AN ACTUAL -- FIRE TRUCK THAT'S ON THE NATION IT'S AN ENGINE BECAUSE THAT'S THE OTHER PIECES IF NEED BE YOU CAN LOOK AT BRING AN INTERNAL TENDER TO BE ABLE TO KEEP IT THERE RIGHT. WITH AGAIN YES YOU YOU COULD LOOK AT THAT OR WE COULD -- BOLT A A FIRE PUMP TO THE GREAT. ACTUALLY IN THE PROJECT AS FAR AS DILLON DELIVERING THE FIRE FLOW AND THAT'S WHY I USE THE TERM OVER KILL AS FAR AS THE ACTUAL TANK WITH ALL THE OTHER MECHANISMS THAT YOU COULD DEPLOY. TO BE ABLE TO FIRE SUPPRESSION THAT'S WHAT WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO DO IN THIS. THEY SERVE A VERY CONDENSED AMOUNT OF TIME GOOD TIMES HELP CHARGING. THANK YOU SO MUCH. UP JUST THAT KIND OF ADD ON WHAT WE'RE DOING AS FAR AS WITH THE G. S. WE'VE TALKED WITH -- DR -- A LITTLE BIT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND AND WHAT WE THOUGHT WAS APPROPRIATE AND ACCURATE ON GETTING -- ACCURATE ESTIMATES EARLIER KIND OF TALKS TO THE NEXT ISSUE -- ALSO AND WE'RE GOING TO BE DISCUSSING THAT WITH THE GS BUT PRIMARILY WHAT WE SEE IS AT ABOUT 75% WORKING DRAWINGS. IS SO YOU'RE A FEW MONTHS AHEAD OF GOING TO BED -- VERIFYING THAT -- WITH THE G. S. AS FAR AS OUR AND AND DISCUSSING WITH FINANCE SO WE'RE ALL ON THE SAME PAGE BEFORE THE PROJECT WAS WARD. I SEE NO OTHER QUESTIONS SIR INTEREST AS MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER TWENTY THIS IS. THE CHALLENGE OF GETTING. LABOR IN THE SANTA CRUZ MOUNTAINS SAYS REPLACE HARD GARAGE MUSIC. SEE. THE TRUE. ISSUE NUMBER TWENTY AGAIN TOM PORTER -- CAL FIRE. THIS IS THE SAN MATTEO SANTA CRUZ UNIT HEADQUARTERS A RELOCATION OF THEIR AUTO SHOP. HOW WE ARE REQUESTING SEVEN POINT THREE FOUR THREE MILLION DOLLARS OF LEASE REVENUE BONDS -- IN ADDITION IF IF FOR ADDITIONAL -- CONSTRUCTION COSTS -- THAT ARE RELATED. TO MOVING THIS FACILITY TO A NEW LOCATION -- AND THAT IS -- AS YOU MENTIONED IN SANTA CRUZ COUNTY IN THE SANTA CRUZ MOUNTAINS. FROM FELTON TO BEN LOMOND -- THE CONSTRUCTION PHASE -- WENT OUT FOR BID AND WE FOUND THAT THE THE ESTIMATES THAT WE HAD BUILT THE BET BUDGET ON WERE NOT COMMENSURATE WITH THE COSTS OF DOING. CONSTRUCTION IN THAT AREA AT THIS POINT IN TIME -- AND SO THERE IS THE BUDGET OVERRUNS ARE AT IN IN ALL AREAS -- IT'S THE THE ABOR AND MATERIALS -- AND THEN ALSO OVERHEAD RATES AND CONTINGENCY THAT ALL INCREASE BASED ON THOSE RATES GOING UP. GET A NICE TEN YEAR DELAY RIGHT. SEVEN AND THIS IS A VERY SIGNIFICANTLY DELAYED PROJECT AS WELL. WHO DO GUEST IN BEN LOMOND I ALEJO? THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THOUGH AS WAS SORT OF ALLUDED TO BY A AS SOME OF THE SOME OF SENATOR MAGUIRE'S COMMENTS ON THE THE LAST ITEM AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE WOULD ROUTE I RECOMMEND FOR THE LEGISLATURE IS JUST AND MAYBE DIGGING IN A LITTLE BIT. MORE ON SOME OVERSIGHT SO THEN IT. THANK COST INCREASES HERE ARE PARTLY RELATED TO THE MARKET CONDITIONS I IN THE AREA THE PROJECT IS BEING BILL. I'M FROM OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH THE DEPARTMENT WITH FINANCE IT DOES SOUND LIKE AND BECAUSETHIS PROJECT WAS USING THE DESIGNS AND ESTIMATES FROM EIGHTY HAVE PRIOR VERY SIMILAR PROJECT -- SOME OF THOSE THINGS WERE SORT OF JUST EXPORTED OVER TO BE USED FOR THIS PROJECT. AND THERE MAY BE THINGS THAT WERE NOT AND FULLY UPDATED TO REFLECT ON BOTH THE SPECIFIC LOCATION OR MAYBE TO REFLECT CHANGES THAT HAPPEN ON THE OTHER PROJECTS OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT PROJECT. ON ENDED UP I'M EXCEEDING ITS BUDGET VERY SIGNIFICANT OTHER PROJECTS OTHER PROJECT ON AND SO. I THINK FOR US WE SORT OF A AT THIS POINT THERE'S NOT A WHOLE LOT YOU KNOW IF YOU WANT TO GO FOR THE PROJECT IT SORT OF IS WHAT IT IS -- BUT IN TERMS AT ENSURING THAT CALIFORNIA -- HAS APPROPRIATED AND PROCESS SEASON PLACE IN THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE D. . S. AND HOW THEY ARE WORKING BACK AND FORTH TO MAKE SURE. THAT IF THEY ARE USING THE ESTIMATES ARE DESIGNS FROM OF A PRIOR PROJECT THAT THEY ARE BEING. I'M FULLY UPDATED TO ACCOUNT FOR ALL THE VARIOUS THINGS THAT LED TO THE COST INCREASE ON THIS PROJECT -- AND TO REALLY ENSURE THAT THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN IF THIS PROCESS THESE AREN'T IN PLACE. I'M YOU MIGHT SEE THIS HAPPENING AGAIN ON FUTURE PROJECTS AND SO WE THINK IT'S JUST A GOOD OPPORTUNITY -- FOR FOR SOME LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT ON ME JUST WITH THE I INITIAL REACTION IS IT'S IT'S AN AUTO GARAGE I MEAN IT'S AN AUTO REPAIR SHOP IT'S TWO TWO LIVES TO FIVE LIVES OKAY IT MIGHT GET A LITTLE COMPLICATED THE LAST TEN YEARS BUT IT'S STILL. AN AUTO REPAIR SHOP IN TH MUNA FROM FELTON. TO YOU KNOW BEN LOMOND OKAY. AND YOU'LL COME BACK WITH US ON THEYEAH I'M TRYING TO BE -- VERY CAREFUL WITH THAT PROPERTIES WE ABANDONED SO I DID YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT THE IT'S EXPECTED THAT. DEVELOPMENT SHOP IS GOING TO BE. DESTROYED AND OF AN ABATED AND I KNOW THAT THEIR I ASSUME BECAUSE OF THE OIL AND THE ACTIVITIES THAT WENT ON THERE SINCE NINETEEN FIFTY NINE OR WHATEVER IT IS. THERE THERE IS A HAZARDOUS WASTE ISSUE THE QUESTION IS IS THAT YOU KNOW FELT AND DOESN'T HAVE THOSE MANY BUILDINGS RIGHT I MEAN THIS SO I DON'T KNOW IF I ASSUME THAT THE THE AUTO SHOP IS GONE GONE GONE IS JUST READY TO BE DESTROYED BUT WILL DEAL WITH. THAT LATER MEMBERS. IN THE AREA THAT CENTER MONEY YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. SHE THE COMMENTS I WOULD JUST HIGHLIGHT SOME. BUT I THINK WAS REFERRED TO IN. IN THE ASSESSMENT HERE IN OUR NOTES SOME. THE PROJECT WAS BID IN FEBRUARY OF THIS YEAR. IN THE LOWEST BID WAS 67% HIGHER. THAN THE STATE ESTIMATES. THAT DOES REFLECT THE CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS IF YOU CAN'T GET ANYONE. THE BUILD FOR WHAT THE STATE'S OFFERING. THEN THE DIS SERVICES ULTIMATELY TO KEEPING. THESE VEHICLES IN SHAPE IN RUNNING THE RESPOND TO FIRE SO -- I THINK SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE. FOR TRYING TO FINE TUNE HOW. OUR PRICING THESE AT THE OUTSET IN NOT USING OUTDATED. DATA -- THIS IS THE AREA WHERE WE NEED IT -- YOU MIGHT GET. A LOWER BID IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BUT THAT'S NOT GONNA HOME SERVICING VEHICLES IN THIS HIGH. PROPENSITY FIRE AREAS SO. ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO MOVE THIS FORWARD I WOULD BE SUPPORTIVE. ONCE FOR CONDITIONS TO HOLD IT OPEN TODAY BUT LET'S MOVE BEYOND THE KITCHEN BEYOND THE GARAGE THE SCHOOL. TO SENATE BILL NINE NO ONE IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS FOR THE WILD FIRE MITIGATION PROGRAM. SO. THIS IS ITEM NUMBER ISSUE NUMBER. TWENTY ONE AND THE ISSUE NUMBER TWENTY ONE AGAIN TOM PORTER -- CAL FIRE -- THIS IS A A CALPERS REQUEST FOR EIGHT HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN MILLION DOLLAR I'M SORRY EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. THAT'S A BIG CHANGE. OF GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUNDS. DO OF FOR THE ADDITION. OF TWO POSITIONS ABOVE THAT THE ONE THAT'S CURRENTLY IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET -- TO MEET THE REVIEW AND ASSESSMENT NEEDS -- IN CONJUNCTION WITH C. P. YOU SEE THIS IS THE CAL FIRE. COLLABORATIVE WITH CPUC. THAT ARE IN ADDITION TO WHAT NINE NO ONE CALLED. FOR AND BASED ON CHANGES THAT WERE MADE IN JANUARY OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN UNDER THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGES. ASSESSMENTOF OF AND ADDS TO WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE IN THOSE PLANS. AND THE REVIEW OF THOSE PLANS -- THAT CALIFORNIA IS GOING. TO HAVE TO DO UNDER THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL'S OFFICE. WE'RE CLEAR BECAUSE I THINK MAYBE. LEGISLATORS NAIVELY ASSUME THAT WHEN YOU YOU ALLOCATE TWO HUNDRED MILLION AND WE DID IT IN THIS SUBCOMMITTEE BEFORE NINE A ONE THAT THAT SORT OF INCLUDED THE WHOLE NOT. ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW IN THE DIFFERENT POSITIONS IMAGES ALL THERE AND YOU'RE SAYING THAT THE JUDGE DETERMINED. UC DETERMINED THAT WE NEEDED TO EXPAND TWO HUNDRED MILLION. UNDER NINE A ONE IS AT THE NOT SHALL. FINANCE HOUSING HERE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IT JUST TO CLARIFY I'M THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION PROVIDED BY A SB NINE NO ONE IS REALLY INTENDED FOR FOREST HEALTH AND FIRE PREVENTION ACTIVITIES AND PROJECTS -- OF THAT AMOUNT THERE'S A HUNDRED AND SIXTY MILLION FOR PROJECTS AND THEN SIR. I AM. HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE MILLION FOR PROJECTS AND THEN THIRTY FIVE MILLION FOR PRESCRIBE FACTOR SO THAT THAT ALLOCATION IS REALLY SPECIFIC FOR WHAT IT'S INTENDED. TO THEN THERE'S THE BROADER REQUIREMENTS OF THE LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE GENERALLY SB NINE A ONE AB TWO NINE ONE ONE AND IT'S SO THERE'S OTHER BILLS WITHIN THAT PACKAGE SB TWELVE SIXTY AS WALL. THAT. NEED TO BE IMPLEMENTED AND SO THAT DOESN'T COME OUT OF THAT TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THAT WOULD BE A ABOVE AND BEYOND THAT TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS GIVEN THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH I THAT TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WAS PROVIDED. THIS IS INTERESTING BECAUSE THE YEAR BEFORE WE DID TWO HUNDRED MILLION IN HERE AND IT WAS SORT OF I'VE I WAS UNDER THE DELUSION THAT WAS JUST A COPY CAT. FOR FIVE FIVE YEARS ALEJO YOU AGREE TO ANNOUNCES YEAH A THINK WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I HAS SAID IS ACCURATE SO WE DIDN'T WE DON'T HAVE ANY ISSUES WHEN WE LOOKED AT THAT PROPOSAL FOR THE TWO POSITIONS. TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE CONTEXT ON THE JANUARY BUDGET INCLUDED ONE POSITION AT CAL FIRE OF FOR DOING AT THE REVIEW OF THE WILD FIRE MITIGATION. PLANS FROM THE UTILITIES AND REALLY THAT'S WHAT THESE POSITIONS ARE GOING TO BE DOING AND SUPPORTING THAT. ON THIS WOULD ADD TWO MORE POSITIONS CURRENTLY I'M AND RECENTLY THE DEPARTMENT HAS HAD IT WINE TEMPORARY POSITION. I'M WORKING ON THE PRE AS BEING I KNOW WHEN WELFARE MITIGATION PLANS AND THAT WAS FUNDEDTHROUGH A COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT WITH THE P. C.. AND AND CAL FIRE WASN'T SPECIFICALLY CALLED OUT NECESSARILY AS HAVING A ROLE IN THAT THEY WERE JUST MORE PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE UNDER SB NINE A ONE BECAUSE HOW FIRE ON IS SPECIFICALLY CALLED OUT AS HAVING A ROLE IN I'M IN REVIEWING THE PLANS. AND WE THINK OF THEM HAVING THEIR OWN STAFF SEEMS REASONABLE AND THREE POSITIONS GIVEN THE NUMBER IN THE COMPLEXITY OF THE PLANS I'M SEEMED REASONABLE -- ARDOR STANDING OF THAT ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE RULED LEAN AND JUST REALLY AFFECTS THE NUMBER AS WELL FOR MITIGATION PLANS SO GOING FROM I THINK SIX TO ELEVEN ON AND SO THAT'S PART OF WHAT IS CHANGING THIS FROM WHAT YOU SIGNED JANUARY IS THAT THERE'S NO MORE PLANS THAT THEY'RE GONNA. HAVE TO BE. REVIEWING AND AND TO US THAT WOULD BE SEPARATE AND APART FROM THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION WHICH IS GOING TO BE GRANT FUNDS GOING OUT FOR FOREST HEALTH. AND FIRE PREVENTION AND THIS IS REALLY ON THE UTILITY SIDE SO WOULD I BE TOO NAIVE TO I ANTICIPATE THAT THERE'S COULD BE A LOT OF WEALTH UTILITY WILDFIRE MEDICATION PLANS FILES SO WE'LL TO HAVE THREE PEOPLE REVIEWING THEM. THAT THEY WOULD BE. LOOK DAD REVIEWED AND APPROVED AT A FASTER PACE OR IS HE JUST MORE APPLIQUE -- APPLICATIONS COMING IN UNDER THE MITIGATION PLAN SO WILL BE AT THE SAME TEMPO. RELATED TO THAT AND I I DO HAVE -- CHIEF MIKE RICH WINE THE FIRE MARSHAL HERE BUT I I'M GONNA -- JUST MENTION THE THE CPUC HAS A TIME LINE THAT IS REQUIRED FOR THE MIDDLE REVIEW AND APPROVAL -- SO WE WOULD FIT INTO THAT TIMELINE OF CPUC. HELL FIRE IS PROVIDING A MORE -- IN DEPTH. SUBJECT MATTER EXPERT AND REVIEW OF THOSE DOCUMENTS AND THOSE DOCUMENTS ARE ARE HAVE BEEN ENHANCED FROM WHERE THEY WERE WHEN WE STARTED THIS PROCESS AS WELL. TWENTY I THINK YOU YES JUST TO ADD ON TO WHAT YOU PORTER SAID. WE WERE MARRIED UPPER WILDFIRE EXPERTISE WITH THE UTILITIES ENGINEERING AND AN INTERVIEW EXPERTISE -- OF THEIRS OF THE ELEMENTS THAT ARE BEING REVIEWED THERE'S TWENTY ELEMENTS ESTABLISHED IN A TEMPLATE THAT THAT WE WORKED ON WITH COLLABORATIVELY WITH THE CPC. SEVEN OF THOSE ARE WILDFIRE INTENSIVE AND THAT'S YOU KNOW RIGHT IN OUR WILL HOUSE -- THESE PLANS ARE HUNDRED A HUNDRED EIGHTY PAGES -- AND SO THEY'RE THEY'RE PRETTY DETAILED AND ALSO WE'RE GONNA BE TRANSITIONING TO THESE WERE ALL SUBMITTED AT ONCE THEY'RE GOING TO BE COMING IN IN FUTURE YEARS -- WHEN THEY WHEN THEY EXPIRE AND SO WE'LL BE REVIEWING THESE PLANS ON AN ONGOING BASIS EVERY YEAR ALSO CONDUCTING EDUCATION WE'RE UPDATING OUR? OUR PYRO OUR POWER LINE -- GUIDE THE EDUCATE OUR FIELD UNITS ON HOW TO CONDUCT INSPECTIONS AND ALSO WILL BE -- CONTINUING TO PROVIDE SOME LEVEL OF OVERSIGHT OVER THE OVER TO ENSURE THE UTILITIES ARE MEETING THE GOALS IN THEIR PLANS HOUSE THE WORK. RECESSION GOING BECAUSE AND WE'VE HAD SEVERAL DISCUSSIONS ABOUT FIRE SEASON WE GOT SEVERAL DISCUSSIONS ANIMATED DISCUSSIONS I MAY SAY ABOUT THE PREVENTION. SO THESE ARE MITIGATION PLAN SO I PRESUME THAT THE DAY AFTER FIRE SEASON ENDS THAT ALL THESE MITIGATION PLANS ARE GOING TO BE ACTED ON SO IS THE ANTICIPATION THAT THE WORK. ON THESE HUNDRED HUNDRED EIGHTY PAGES ARE THAT. I HAVE PREPARED AND THEN ONCE IT'S ALL ALL CLEAR THAT WE CAN GO THAT THAT THE WORK IS GOING TO BE PACKED COMMENCED. I MEAN BECAUSE WE DO HAVE IT SEASON HERE. CORRECT. AND THOSE PLANS WERE DUE TO THE C. P. U. C. ON MARCH NINETEENTH. AND SO THAT REVIEW IS IS GOING IS UNDER WAY RIGHT NOW -- BUT WE WILL BE WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE C. P. C. TO ENSURE THAT YOU KNOW THE THE ELEMENTS IN THE PLANS. ARE ARE BEING BROUGHT FORTH INTO THE FIELD. OKAY MEMBERS QUESTIONS THIS IS THE URBAN WILDLIFE. OUR UTILITY WILDLIFE MEDICATION PLANS. WE'RE GONNA HOLD THIS MATTER OPEN MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WE HAVE THREE MATTERS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FORESTRY AND FIRE PROTECTION ISSUES NUMBER. NINETEEN THE ISSUE IS SHE CAMP KITCHEN ISSUE TWENTY THE CEMETERY SANTA CRUZ. AUTO GARAGE IN ISSUE NUMBER -- TWENTY ONE THE UTILITY WHILE FIRE MITIGATION OPEN THE PUBLIC HEARING MEMBERS COMMENT. CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I THANK YOU NEXT TIME THIS CALL OF THE STATE. HE DIRECTOR BOTTOM WHAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. WE'D LIKE. TO GO TO ITEM NUMBER. TWENTY FOUR THIS IS THE SERVICE. PLEASE BUDGET -- REVIEW THIS IS. THE TIMES THEY ARE A. CHANGING PLEASE. DEPUTY BOTTOM GO AHEAD THIS IS AN EXCITING PRESS RECTOR GOOD MORNING. MY NAME IS CHUCK BOTTOM ON THE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. I APPRECIATE THE REQUEST FROM COMMITTEE STAFF TO SPEND EXTRA MOMENT AND EXPLAIN SERVICE BASED BUDGETING. FOR THE COMMITTEE AND OUR PROGRESS TODAY. SO WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO IS COVER THE WHO. THE WHAT. THE WHERE IN THE Y.. SO THE TECHNICAL REQUEST IN FRONT OF YOU -- THIS SPRING FINANCE LETTER IS FOR A ONE TIME. TWO MILLION DOLLAR. APPROPRIATION FROM THE ENVIRONMENTAL LICENSE PLATE FUND STAFF RECOMMENDATION OF COURSE IS APPROVED AS BUDGET. WHAT IS SERVICE BASED BUDGETING? IT TURNS OUT IT'S ACTUALLY A BUSINESS DISCIPLINE. WITHIN THE MANAGEMENT CONSULTANCY WORLD. FOLKS TO GO TO GRADUATE SCHOOL FOR BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION SPECIALIZE IN IT. AND IN FACT THERE'S A SUB NIECE WITHIN SERVICE BASED BUDGETING THAT IS FOCUSED ON PUBLIC SECTOR. ENTITIES ENTERPRISES IT'S A ASPECT OF MANAGEMENT REVIEW WHICH FOCUSES ON FOUR KEY THINGS. THE FIRST THING THAT THE FOCUS. DIREXION SELF TOWARDS IS ANALYZING AN ENTITY OR AN ENTERPRISES TASK. THE ACTUAL ACTIVITIES THEY DO AT A VERY GRANULAR LEVEL. FROM WHETHER IT'S SENDING A PATROL BOAT OUT INTO THE CHANNEL ISLANDS TO CLEANING THE RESTROOMS AN ECOLOGICAL RESERVE AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN. THE SECOND KEY ASPECT IS THAT IT'S LABOR FOCUS. YOU ANALYZE THE TASKS OF THE ENTERPRISE. BENCHMARKED AGAINST THE MISSION. AND THEN YOU GO THROUGH A SCRUTON IS ATION OF THE HOURS YOUR LABOR FORCE ARE APPLYING. TO RID THE RESPECTIVE TAX. THE THIRD PRONG IS. YOU ORGANIZE THIS REVIEW BY SERVICE. INSTEAD OF THINKING IN WORD ABOUT THE BUREAUCRACY OF THE ENTERPRISE YOU LOOK OUT WORDS IN YOU PONDER. AND REVIEW WHAT DO YOUR CLIENTS EXPECT. AND YOU STRUCTURE THIS REVIEW OF TASKS. LABOR FORCE AROUND THE SERVICES YOU'RE PROVIDING TO THE CLIENT OR IN THIS CASE THE PUBLIC. AND THE LAST THING YOU DO IS YOU BRING ANALYTICS TO BEAR. AND YOU CREATE A TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATED SYSTEM TO TRACK ALL THESE METRICS AND THEN ANNUALLY UPDATE THEM. SO THAT'S SERVICE BASED BUDGETING HOW DID WE GET HERE. WELL IT'S A SEVENTY YEAR OLD DILEMMA. I ACTUALLY TOLD YOU LAST YEAR THAT I FOUND A NINETEEN FIFTY EIGHT BOOZ ALLEN REPORT. I TO THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE. ANALYZING OUR DEPARTMENT AND ITS FUNDING SITUATION BACK IN. NINETEEN FIFTY EIGHT WE ACTUALLY HAVE A FISHING GAME CODE PROVISION SEVEN TEN POINT FIVE WHERE THE LEGISLATURE IS FOUND AND DECLARED. THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS UNDER FUNDED AND MUST SEEK RELIABLE FUNDING. IT IS MANY OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS KNOW -- BACK IN BILL. TWENTY THREE SEVENTY SIX INSTRUCTED OUR DEPARTMENT TO CREATE A STAKEHOLDER DRIVEN PROCESS. AND GO THROUGH A REVIEW OF THE REFORMS NECESSARY FOR OUR DEPARTMENT TO MODERNIZE IT. AND OUR SISTER ENTITY ARE FISHING GAME COMMISSION. AND IN A NONPARTISAN REPORT. A VERY BROAD STAKEHOLDER GROUP CAME UP WITH TWENTY EIGHT RECOMMENDATIONS. WE'VE ACTUALLY HAD ABOUT TWO BUDGET CYCLES. WHERE ID BEEN IN FRONT OF YOU IN PRETTY TENSE MOMENTS TALKING ABOUT FEE INCREASES ACROSS SEVERAL SECTORS? AND HOW TO DEAL WITH OUR COST OF SERVICE DYNAMIC. THEN IN THE BUDGET ACT OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN YOU INSTRUCTED OUR DEPARTMENT TO BRING OUR BAND BACK TOGETHER. TO GET ALTHOUGH STAKEHOLDERS BACK TOGETHER AND ASSESS OUR STATUS. IN FILLING THOSE TWENTY EIGHT RECOMMENDATIONS. WE SUBMITTED A REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE IN OCTOBER. OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN ABOUT THAT. THEN IN NOVEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THAT STAKEHOLDER BASE CAME UP WITH AN EXPENDITURE CONCEPT. THAT LED INTO LAST YEAR'S BUDGET CYCLE. AND HERE'S THE TAKE AWAY THE BUDGET ACT OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN APPROPRIATED AN ADDITIONAL THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR OUR DEPARTMENT. IN A SIGNED US THE TASK OF DOING SERVICE BASED BUDGETING. WHY ARE WE IN THE SPOT I THINK WE ARE IN THE SPOT BECAUSE? OF THE PURSUIT OF SUSTAINABLE FUNDING FOR FISH AND WILDLIFE CONSERVATION. WE HAVE MORE ANIMALS AND PLANTS IN THE STATE THAN ANY OTHER STATE IN THE UNION. MORE OF THEM ARE FOUND NO WHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD. SO THEY'RE INCREDIBLY RARE. WE HAVE AN INTERSECT OF A THRIVING ECONOMY. AND INCREDIBLE NATURAL WEALTH. IN MAKING THOSE WORK TOGETHER IS A LOT OF OUR DEPARTMENTS JURISDICTION. SO WHY SERVICE BASED BUDGETING. I THINK TO ME FOR OUR DEPARTMENT SERVICE BASED BUDGETING IS OUR MOMENT IN TIME. TO DO RIGHT AROUND TRANSPARENCY. AROUND TRUST. AROUND INNOVATION AROUND EFFICIENCIES AROUND ACCOUNTABILITY. YOU GAVE US SPECIFIC ASSIGNMENTS AND SB EIGHT FIFTY FOUR HERE THEY ARE. YOU TOLD US BY DECEMBER FIFTEENTH OF TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN GET A CONSULTANT FIRM UNDER CONTRACT CHECK. WE'VE HIRED. BEFORE THAT DEADLINE DELOITTE THE NATIONAL CONSULTING FIRM. WHO BY THE WAY IS THE FIRM THAT DID A SIMILAR PROCESS FOR OUR STATE PARKS DEPARTMENT? WHICH HAS FACILITATED THAT PARKS DEPARTMENT'S RELATIONSHIP. AND I THINK YOU SEE IT FEET INTO PROP. SIXTY EIGHT AND OTHER STRATEGIC REFORMS FOR THAT DEPARTMENT. SO WE HARD DE EXPERT. TO BE OUR CONSULTANT. YOU TOLD US BY DECEMBER OF LAST YEAR. THE FORMER LEADERSHIP TEAM WE'VE DONE THAT. YOU TOLD US TO FORM AN EXTERNAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE WE'VE DONE THAT IT HAS ABOUT EIGHTY PEOPLE ON IT. AND YOU TOLD US TO GIVE YOU A STATUS REPORT WE'VE DONE THAT. BY APRIL FIFTEENTH OF TWENTY TWENTY YOU HAVE ASKED US TO GIVE AN INTERIM STATUS REPORT AND APPEAR IN OVERSIGHT HEARINGS ON THE PROGRESS. BY JANUARY FIFTEENTH OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE YOU TOLD US TO COMPLETE OUR FINAL REPORT. AND MY APRIL FIFTEENTH OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE YOU'VE ASKED US TO REFER. HOW THE OUTCOMES HAVE BEEN INTEGRATED INTO OUR BUDGET CHANGE PROCESS [inaudible] SO. WHAT I HAVE DONE AS DIRECTOR IS? WE'VE TALKED ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY PEOPLE ACROSS OUR DEPARTMENT. YOUNG TO OLD DIVERSITY IN EXPERIENCE BACKGROUND AND POSITION WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT. TO DO THIS. I'M PERSONALLY ENGAGED ON A WEEKLY BASIS. WE SAT DOWN WITH THE PARKS DEPARTMENT COUNTLESS TIMES TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY LEARNED. SO WE CAN SAVE MONEY TO ITS SMARTER FASTER THE SECOND GO AROUND. WITH BRIEF JURORS. AND I AM VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT. BECAUSE THE BENEFITS TO ME PROVE WHAT I THINK PEOPLE WANT FROM GOVERNMENT. IT IS POSSIBLE TO PAUSE PLAY RIGOR TO YOUR ACTIVITIES AND COME OUT MORE TRANSPARENTLY FORMED IN SHAPE FOR OUR FUTURE. WHAT'S THE REQUEST. TO THE ORIGINAL FUNDING ALLOCATION WAS TWO MILLION DOLLARS. WE TOOK ONE POINT FIVE MILLION AND WE HARD TO LLOYD. WE TOOK FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND WHICH COVERED ARE. OUR BURDEN OF YOU KNOW REDIRECTING A HUNDRED THIRTY PEOPLE ON THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO DO THIS. WE WILL BE DONE WITH MOST OF THE MILESTONES AS WE GET TO THE END OF THIS YEAR BUT THERE'S A SECOND PHASE WHICH I WOULD ARGUE IS MORE IMPORTANT. ONE OF THE OUTCOMES IS A TECHNOLOGICALLY DRIVEN TOOL A DASHBOARD. IT ALLOWS YOU TO SEE THESE TASKS THESE SERVICES AND OUR ACCOUNTING. BENCHMARKED AGAINST OUR CURRENT ABILITY. AND ARE PROJECTED FUTURE NEEDS. WHAT'S LEFT TO DO IN THE SECOND PHASE IS I NEED THIS OUTCOME TO BECOME A WAY OF LIFE WITHIN OUR DEPARTMENT. I NEED TO TAKE THREE THOUSAND EMPLOYEES. RETRAINING. THROUGH CHANGE MANAGEMENT. AN INSTITUTIONAL CULTURALLY AWARE. KIND OF EMPLOYEE SENSE THAT THIS IS OUR TOOL FOR OUR FUTURE. THAT WE USE THAT ARE THINKING ARE PLANNING IN OUR ACTIVITIES. THAT'S THE REQUEST FOR THE ADDITIONAL TWO MILLION DOLLARS AS WELL AS COMPLETE THE FINAL REPORTING. THAT HAPPENED OUT IN. TWENTY TWENTY ONE I'LL STOP AND SEE IF THERE ANY QUESTIONS. EXCELLENT. THIS IS A APPROVE IS REQUESTED LA -- YOU HAVE COMMENTS. YES GOOD MORNING RACHEL EHLERS WITH THE LEGEND LISTS OFFICE I WE HAVE BEEN REALLY ENCOURAGED BY THE ENTHUSIASM AND PROGRESS AND COMMUNICATION THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS -- BEEN SHOWING WITH REGARD TO THIS EFFORT IT WAS SOMETHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE ADDED AN REQUEST IT WASN'T SOMETHING THAT THE DEPARTMENT CAME FORWARD TO REQUEST BUT THEY'VE. CLEARLY REALLY BOUGHT INTO IT AND ARE RUNNING WITH IT. SO WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT THIS IS REALLY GOING TO YIELD A HELPFUL TOOL BOTH FOR THE DEPARTMENT FOR YOU AS POLICY MAKERS AND FOR THE PUBLIC IN THE FUTURE. SENATE MCGUIRE. THANK YOU SO MUCH OF THE VERY READ MISTER CHAIRMAN TO SAY. HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE DIRECTOR WORKING ON THIS? WITH A BIASED VIEW TOWARDS FISHERIES I END UP ON THE MANY CONVERSATIONS THAT WE'VE HAD ON WHICH FISHERIES BEING. I HOW YOU IN CUMBER FISHERY COUNTS AND HOW THAT WORKS HAS BEEN A CHALLENGING AT TIMES THANK EVERYONE EVEN INTO INTERNALLY OF HIT THEIR HEAD AGAINST A WALL. IN BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE THIS TRANSPARENT PROCESS IS GONNA BE HUGE BOTH. FOR FISHERIES THE INDUSTRY AND INTERNALLY AS WELL TO BE AGAIN ACCURATE ACCOUNTING I'M CAN YOU JUST REAL QUICK RUN DOWN.

IN ADDITION TO THE STAND UP ACTIVITIES HIRING CONSULTANT GIVE FORMING TEAMS. WE'RE IN A HEAVY MEETING MOMENT AND I SEE THAT RUNNING THROUGH. THE REST OF THIS SUMMER AS AN INDICATOR. WE'VE DONE OUR FIRST CUT WITH THOSE A HUNDRED AND TWENTY OR THIRTY PEOPLE OF OUR TASKS. AND DAY IDENTIFIED -- THREE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THREE TASKS WE PROVIDE AS SERVICES TO OUR CONSTITUENTS. BASED ON THE ACCOUNT THE INDIVIDUAL COUNTY YOUR LIVER ACT AND ALL THE WORK WE DO LITERALLY CHANGING THE TOILET PAPER AT THE RESERVE. TO THE SURVEY FOR HEARING AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN BIGGER AND SMALLER. TO WEAR DOWN AT THAT LEVEL OF GRANULARITY NOW WE NEED TO DO SOME SORTING AND FILTERING. IT DEPENDS A LITTLE BIT ON WHETHER YOU'RE A LUMP OR A SPLITTER I PROJECT WE GET DOWN TO ABOUT TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED TASK WHEN WE'RE DONE. THEN WE'VE GOT TO GO OUT AND CONTINUE OUR EXTERNAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE MEETINGS TAKE IT BACK TO ARE STAKEHOLDERS GET THEIR FEEDBACK. WE'VE ALSO. FORCED OURSELVES TO STOP TALKING ABOUT OUR OWN BUREAUCRACY WE'RE CURRENTLY STRUCTURED. USING OUR OWN LINGO. AND WHAT WE'VE DONE IN THE LAST MONTH. IS FIGURE OUT HOW TO WAIT TO DEFINE OUR SERVICES USING PLAIN ENGLISH PLAIN LANGUAGE. THAT THE CUSTOMER CONNECTS WITH BETTER. WE'VE TAKEN ALL THOSE CATEGORIES OF SERVICES BACK OUT TO THE STAKEHOLDER COMMUNITY AND WE SECOND FEEDBACK. SO I SEE THAT ITERATIVE EXCHANGE. GOING THROUGH THE REST OF THE SUMMER SECOND MAIN ACTIVITY. WE'RE BUILDING AT THE TECHNOLOGICAL TOOL. THAT THEN TAKES ALL THIS INPUT AND DISPLAYS IT IN. LET ME GIVE YOU SOME HYPOTHETICALS YOU WANT TO LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN HUMBOLDT COUNTY. YOU CAN CLICK ON THIS TOOL YOU CAN FIND IT HUMBOLDT COUNTY YOU GO TO LANCE MANAGEMENT. YOU SEE ALL THE PROPERTIES YOU CLICK AND THEN SEE A PIE CHART WHICH DESCRIBES CURRENT EXPENDITURES BENCHMARKING. AGAINST IF WE REALLY WERE ACHIEVING SUCCESS RIGHT. SO WE'RE BUILDING THAT TECHNOLOGICAL TO AT THE SAME TIME AND I THINK WE'RE TEST DRIVING IT INTERNALLY. I THINK BY THE TIME WE GET TO LATE SUMMER EARLY FALL KIND OF DAYLIGHTING THAT AND WORK SHOPPING THAT AS WELL. IN IN SIX SAME IDEA ON CRAB HERESY HIM IN RIGHT TO JUST. TO ALSO PERMITTING -- FOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS TO INSERT EVERYTHING TO GETTING PEOPLE OUTDOORS TO ENHANCING WILL SAVE YOU KNOW CONSERVATION IN THE OCEAN. AND EVERYTHING WE'RE TRYING TO DO. I THINK THAT'S THE MAJORITY OF THIS YEAR. AND BY THE END OF THIS YEAR WE'RE IN A GOOD POSITION WITH ALL THE THE ANALYTICS THE DATA. AND THE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT. IN GREEN LIGHT AS FAR AS THIS IS NOW GOING TO BE A USABLE TOOL WITHIN THE OFFICE WHAT WAS YOUR GOT. I THINK AT THE END OF THIS YEAR WE SHOULD HAVE A TOOL THAT'S REALLY HELPING US BE MORE STRATEGIC AS WE'RE WORKING WITH OUR SISTER AGENCIES. IT MAY NOT YET BE FULLY FINAL. OR PUBLISHED IF YOU WILL A GOOD ENOUGH TO HAVE IT START TO GUIDE OUR OWN DECISION MAKING AND POTENTIALLY USED BY THE TIME YOU SEE ME YOUR NEXT YEAR. ASSUMING I'M STILL AROUND WHICH I DIDN'T END UP. BUT WHAT IS THE WHAT I'M SEEING HE SAYS I FOR EXAMPLE AND AGAIN I'M NOT TRYING. TO FOCUS JUST ON FISHERIES JUST BECAUSE IT'S SO MUCH TOP OF MIND RIGHT. YOU'LL BE ABLE TO STAY ON THE CRAP ACCOUNT. THIS IS HOW MUCH PEOPLE POWER WE USED. TESTING COST US ACTS OF ME. I'M JUST USING Z. EXAMPLES THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE HOPING TO BE ABLE TO GET TO DE GIVE THAT'S WHAT I'M HOPING TO I DON'T KNOW THE LEVEL OF COMPLETE PRECISION. IT'S HARD TO TAKE AN INDIVIDUAL PERSON AND SAY 10% OF U. S.

I THAT VOTES TO ONE WILL KEEP MATTER OPEN FOR THE ABSENT MEMBERS LET'S GO. TO OIL AND GAS DE COMMISSIONING LITIGATION. WHEN IN CO L. L. C. N. RENCONTRE LLC? YOU KNOW HERE UNFORTUNATE THAT YOU GOT A CHAIR THAT HAS A BACKGROUND IN BANKRUPTCY YES SO MY MY CHALLENGE HERE. IS THE BANKRUPTCY JUDGE WHEN WHEN YOU HAVE AN ADVERSARY PROCEEDING EVERY DEBTOR IN POSSESSION EVERY DEBTOR THINKS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO SUE EVERYBODY IN ORDER TO GET SOME MONEY TO FUND THEIR PLAN. THAT'S THAT'S JUST GIVEN AND WHAT THE JUDGE DOES IS THAT SAYS YOU HAVE O MUCH MONEY WE'RE NOT GOING TO WASTE MONEY ON ATTORNEY FEES GOING AFTER LITIGATION WITH THE PRAYER THAT YOU MAY GET. SOME RECOVERY. DO YOU CAN YOU BUT YOU'VE GOT TO GO WHEN THEY'RE AND JUSTIFY THE EMPLOYMENT OF PROFESSIONALS TO GO IN TO GO AFTER ASSETS. SO I'M CONCERNED HERE THAT WE'RE ASKING -- FOR ASSISTANCE OF ASSISTANCE IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF A A PIECE IS WHERE WE AT LEAST WHEN I FIRST GOT TO BE THE CHAIR HERE I THOUGHT WELL THESE WERE ABANDONED WELLS THERE THEY DIDN'T DO THE CLEAN UP. THERE'S NO ASSETS THEY'RE THEY'RE ALL THE WILL OF HIS BINGE. I BEEN TRAIN FROM THEM -- SO. I'M A LITTLE BIT CONCERNED I GUESS OF COURSE -- AND THAT YOU'RE CONCERN IS WELL FOUNDED I AM -- HAPPY TO REPORT TO YOU THAT -- WERE NOT SEEKING LITIGATION -- COST SUPPORT -- TO PURSUED THE STATE -- SHARE IN THE BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS WE'VE BEEN DOING THAT FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS -- IN THE VAN ECHO PLATFORM HOLLY SITUATION -- THE TRUSTEE HAS ACTUALLY FILED SUIT AGAINST THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION FOR INVERSE CONDEMNATION OF AN UPSWING PROCESSING FACILITY THAT THE STATE -- LANDS COMMISSION IS -- OPERATING AND MAINTAINING FOR THE PURPOSES OF DECOMMISSIONING THE THIRTY TWO WELLS OFF SHORE AND SO THE LITIGATION REQUEST ASSOCIATED WITH VAN ECHO REALLY IS -- FOR DEFENSE COSTS AS WE FIGHT THE TRUSTEE ON THIS INVERSE CONDEMNATION -- ACTION WHICH THEY FILED IN BANKRUPTCY COURT WHICH IS AS YOU KNOW A LITTLE -- UNUSUAL -- AND UNPRECEDENTED FROM THE STATE'S PERSPECTIVE AND SO WE ARE I AM APPEAL THAT WE HAD AN ADVERSE REAL RULING IN THE BANKRUPTCY COURT ON THE INVERSE CONDEMNATION ACTION WE'VE APPEALED TO THE U. S. DISTRICT OF DELAWARE. WE ARE FIGHTING THAT -- TO WITH THE GOAL OF REMOVING THAT CASE -- FROM THE UMBRELLA OF BANKRUPTCY TO STATE COURT IT WOULDN'T GO TO THE BATTERY WENT DIRECTLY TO THE DISTRICT BECAUSE NORMALLY GOES THE BANKRUPTCY APPEAL PANEL THE BACKUP. YEAH -- BUT IT JUST WENT DIRECTLY TO THE DISTRICT COURT WHICH IT CAN HAPPEN YEAH I THINK THE THE RULES ARE A LITTLE DE UM A DIFFERENT IN DELAWARE -- AS I'M NOT AS FAMILIAR WITH -- THE SPECIFIC PROCESS SEES -- BUT WE JUST PARTICIPATED IN -- A MEDIATION SESSION ON MONDAY IN DELAWARE -- AS A CASES BEFORE THE US DISTRICT COURT IS I'M JUST CONCERNED THAT THE TRUSTEE REALLY THINKS THAT HE CAN. WHERE SHE CAN WHOEVER CAN GET MONEY OUT OF THE? YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S AN ASSET THAT INVERSE CONDEMNATION CLAIM THAT ITS MERIT MERIT TESTS. WHICH IS IT WE COMPLETELY AGREE WHICH IS WHY WE ARE FIGHTING IT -- TOOTH AND NAIL BECAUSE JUST UP THE HOW OBNOXIOUS. REALLY THE POSITION BY THE TRUSTEE IS HERE SINCE THE STATE IS. MONACO'S MASS -- AND WE ALSO DON'T WANT ANYTHING LIKE THIS TO SET PRECEDENT. AS WE MOVE FORWARD ON THE RINCON ISLAND AND I APOLOGIZE COLLEAGUES. THEY FILE TWO DAYS BEFORE THE LEASE EXPIRED RIGHT TYPICALLY UNDER THE THE CODE THE DEBTOR HAS A HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS. TO ASSUME THE LACE THERE'S NOTHING TO ASSUME HERE THAT'S WHAT IT TOOK LIKE. FIFTEEN MONTHS TO FINALLY GET DONE WITH THAT. JUST GIVE ME A HIGHLIGHT HOW DID THAT HAPPEN HOW. HOW IN THE WORLD THAT THAT HAPPENED RIGHT RIGHT WELL WE WERE UNDER AND ADMINISTRATIVE STAY RIGHT NOW LIKE I GET YET BUT BUT NORMALLY YOU COULD HAVE SAID HEY THE DEBTOR DIDN'T ASSUME THE LEASE THERE'S NOTHING TO ASSUME? IT'S REJECTED BY LAW I MEAN I IMAGINE SOMEBODY DID A MOTION THIS TO THE COURT TO SAY MAKE IT KNOWLEDGE IS JUST TAKE JUDICIAL NOTICE AT THE LEASES EXPIRED. RIGHT -- SO -- ACTUALLY THE THAT WAS PART OF THE ARGUMENTS THAT WE ARE MAKING IN BANKRUPTCY COURT WE DID HAVE A POSITIVE RULING -- THAT REALLY FORCED RINCON R. I. L. P. TO QUIT CLAIM THE LEASES EVENTUALLY WHAT WE'RE SEEKING HERE ACTUALLY IS -- TO BE ABLE TO GO AFTER FORMER PARTNERS -- THROUGH YOU KNOW TO ESSENTIALLY BREAK THROUGH THE CORPORATE STRUCTURE AND GO AFTER FORMER GENERAL PARTNERS -- AND THE LARGER CORPORATE STRUCTURE TO BE ABLE TO RECOUP THE STATE'S COSTS SO -- SOME OF THE FORMER GENERAL PARTNERS -- FORM -- AND OTHER CORPORATE STRUCTURE -- OVER I'LL P.

FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND REQUEST IN A HUNDRED IN A MILLION POINT ZERO NINE NINE THE WATER QUALITY SUPPLYING INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENT FUND OF TWENTY FOURTEEN ALSO KNOWN AS PROP. ONE THANK YOU YESTHIS IS A REQUEST TO SHIFT THAT FINDS WITHIN THE COASTAL CONSERVANCY SUPPORT BUDGET -- AS YOU NOTED FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FROM THE ENVIRONMENTAL LICENSE PLATE AND A MILLION DOLLARS FROM PROP. ONE THIS IS -- FOR VERY SMALL AGENCY THE COSTA CONSERVANCY HAS A FAIRLY COMPLICATED SUPPORT BUDGET -- AND THIS IS PART OF A LONGER TERM EFFORT WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY. TO STABILIZE OUR FUNDING A LITTLE BIT TO REDUCE OUR RELIANCE ON THE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS FROM BOND FUNDS BECAUSE THOSE FUNDS ARE BOTH LIMITED AND RESTRICTED IN WHAT WE CAN CAN DO WITH THAT SO THIS PROVIDE SOME GENERAL OPERATING. FUNDING TO THE LPF AND THEN THE PROP ONE FUNDING I REFLECTS THE CURRENT WORKLOAD WHERE WE'RE CURRENTLY MANAGING ABOUT. NINETY PROP ONE PROJECTS AND WE JUST CLOSE THE GRANT ROUND YESTERDAY OR MONDAY SO WE WILL BE TAKING MORE PROP ONE PROJECTS FORWARD. WHO WOULD'VE THOUGHT DELL'S BLACK AND YELLOW LICENSE PLACE? BACK IN THE DAY. COME SAVE YOU NOW -- MEMBERS QUESTIONS UNDER STERN. I JUST WANTED. POINT OUT THOUGH IT IS STAFF NOW SAYS NOTES IS ENTIRELY SAFE. WE STILL THE STRENGTH THAT. SO I JUST WANT TO GET YOUR PERSPECTIVE THE GOVERNOR VETOED. LEGISLATION LAST YEAR THAT WOULD HAVE OFFERED YOU ALL A NEW LICENSE PLATE THAT WE THOUGHT WAS GOING TO HAVE. BIG CULTURAL APPEAL AND REALLY SELL -- IS CONCERNED ABOUT DIEM BE I GUESS HAVING TOO MUCH ON THEIR PLATE. BUT I WANT TO GET YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON OTHER WAYS TO GET CREATIVE IS THE CONCERN HERE IS. I I I LIKE THEY WERE GONNA FIND YOUR OPERATIONS AND AND GET THAT GOING BUT FUNDS ALREADY DEPLETED RIGHT AND OVER NINE MILLION DOLLAR A YEAR DEFICIT. WHAT WHAT DO WE DO? TO THE FED UP AGAIN I JUST AS A TEASER IS BRINGING THE BILL BACK -- BUT BUT AT THAT I'M NOT SAYING THAT'S THE FIFTH OF THE TOTAL FIX SO. YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW THAT I HAVE A TOTAL ANSWER I THINK THE THE STRATEGY AT THE COASTAL CONSERVANCY HAS BEEN -- TO TO DIVERSIFY THE FUNDS THAT ARE SUPPORTING SO THAT WE'RE TAKING ADMINISTRATIVE -- LITTLE ADMINISTRATIVE PERCENTAGES OFF OF ALL OF THE FUNDS THAT WE ADMINISTER WE'VE ALSO BEEN. I AM VERY SUCCESSFUL IN THE PAST IN GETTING GRANTS -- FOR OUR PROJECTS AND AND INCREASING THE AMOUNT THAT WE WERE COVERED LIKE THROUGH OUR FEDERAL INDIRECT COST RATE. UNFORTUNATELY FEDERAL FUNDS ARE A LITTLE BIT SHAKY YEAR -- THAN THEY WERE IN THE PAST I THINK YOU KNOW IN THE LONG RUN I'M WE ARE VERY INTERESTED IN HAVING STABLE FUNDING. I'M WE DON'T THINK THAT THE BOND FUND SHOULD BE FUNDING OUR OUR STATE OPERATIONS -- SO ANY SOLUTION WERE WERE VERY HAPPY TO WORK WITH.

LOS ANGELES RIVER CONSERVANCY SAN GABRIEL CLOSE PUBLIC HEARING. MOTION BY SENATOR MCGUIRE LIST PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. SB HI IN THE CHOIR [inaudible] MONNING. MATTER OPEN FOR THE ABSENT MEMBERS -- CAN. MOVE CALLED THE AIRPORT THANK YOU VERY MUCH [inaudible] THIS IS. A MILLION DOLLARS ON EDUCATION COSTS. DEFENDING OUR CIVIL. LITIGATION PLEASE PROCEED AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN OFWHITE HOUSE E. S.. AND I SENATOR MONNING AND MEMBERS OF THE CHANGE I'M A DEPUTY EXECUTIVE OFFICER AT THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD. AND I'M HERE TO SAY TALK OUR REQUEST I'M THIS INCREASED AUTHORITY WOULD ENSURE THAT WE HAVE ACCESS TO SUFFICIENT RESOURCES TO PURSUE ADDITIONAL LITIGATION. CURRENTLY WE HAVE A DIRECT STRONG COUNT WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE OF THREE POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. THE AG'S OFFICE CHARGES IS BASED ON THE HOURS THEY DEVOTE TO OUR CASES SO IT WE DON'T USE ALL THE FUNDS EVERY YEAR IT DEPENDS ON HOW COMPLEX OUR CASES ARE WHETHER THEY GO. TO EXPERT WITNESSES YOU NEED TRAVEL THINGS LIKE THAT. WE'RE ASKING UP OR IF FORTY A MILLION DOLLARS BECAUSE WE HAVE BUMPED UP AGAINST THAT'LL THAT THREE POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLAR LIMIT IN PAST YEARS. ESPECIALLY WHEN WE HAVE COMPLEX CASES OR MULTIPLE COMPLEX CASES AND WE ANTICIPATE INCREASED COSTS IN THE COMING YEARS FOR TWO MAJOR REASONS. FIRST I'M FOR THE VOLKSWAGEN AND FIAT CHRYSLER CASES WE WERE FORTUNATE THAT THE AG'S OFFICE REPRESENTED US THROUGH THE CONSUMER LAW SECTION BECAUSE THERE WERE CONSUMER CLAIMS. AND WHAT THAT MEANT IS THEY DIDN'T CHARGE US THEIR COSTS. SO FOR THOSE TWO CASES WE ACTUALLY -- WE'RE IN PRETTY GOOD SHAPE FROM A FINANCIAL STANDPOINT FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE. I'M THEY ARE NOT I'M CHIMING IN FROM THE CONSUMER LAW SECTION OR IN OUR REMAINING CASES WE ARE CONTINUING TO INVESTIGATE. ADDITIONAL EMISSION VIOLATIONS AND BECAUSE THE NATURAL RESOURCES SECTION IS REPRESENTING US IN THOSE CASES -- THEY WE ARE BEING CHARGED FOR THEIR WORK NOW. THE SECOND MAJOR REASON AS THIS COMMITTEE KNOWS WE'RE ENGAGED IN A FIGHT WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. OVER THE RIGHT OF CALIFORNIA TO SET OUR OWN EMISSIONS STANDARDS. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS TRYING TO ROLL BACK OUR VEHICLE STANDARDS MAKING IT HARDER IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO MEET OUR AIR QUALITY AND CLIMATE GOALS. WE'VE ALREADY FILED A FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT LAWSUIT SEEKING BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE TECHNICAL BASIS BEHIND TO THEIR PROPOSALS. AND IF AS WE EXPECT EPA FINALIZES A RULE TO WITHDRAW OUR WAIVER AND TAKE AWAY OUR AUTHORITY TO SET VEHICLE STANDARDS. YOU CAN THAT WE'RE GONNA BE SELLING OVER THAT ONE THAT WE'RE GONNA BE FIGHTING TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN PROVIDE HELPFUL AIR TO CALIFORNIANS. NOW THEY MENTIONED AT THE BEGINNING OF OUR OF MY REMARKS IF WE'RE LUCKY AND OUR LITIGATION COSTS ARE LOW. WE WILL NOT BE EXPENDING THESE FUNDS BUT IF WE NEED TO LITIGATE TO PROTECT OUR AIR QUALITY STANDARDS WE ABSOLUTELY WANT TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT. WELL THE AP CHANGE YOU FEEL LUCKY NOW IT'S JUST -- SO IN THE STAFF REPORT NOTES IT WAS SIX MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR ON THIS MULTIPLE COMPLEX LITIGATION THIRTEEN YEARS AGO. WHAT MAKES YOU THINK YOU GET TO GET IT DONE WITH UNDER FIVE I MEAN I? AND THE FIVE MINUTES WE GET IN THE BARGAIN FROM. GENERAL STATE IT DEPENDS IT DEPENDS ON WHAT'S HAPPENING SO WE DID HAVE A CASE YOU KNOW FIFTEEN YEARS AGO WHEN WE WERE IN BROILED IN THE FIRST SET A VEHICLE OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION STANDARDS. THAT WE HAD VERY VERY HIGH COSTS AND THAT TRIAL HAPPENS ON THE EAST COAST THERE WERE A LOT OF EXPERTS THAT WE HAD TO HIRE FOR THAT. SINCE THEN OUR COSTS HAVE BEEN EITHER BELOW ARE THREE POINT. FOUR MILLION PER YEAR OR SORT OF RIGHT AROUND IT WE HAVE GONE ABOVE IT A YEAR OR TWO I'M IN THIS CASE AS I SAID WE SEE THESE THINGS COMING AT US WE THINK A MILLION. IN ADDITIONAL AUTHORITY WILL COVER US ON I'M GONNA STOP RIGHT THERE I WAS GONNA SAY SOME IS LIKE ALL STOP [inaudible] THANKS. ALL RIGHT WE'VE ACTUALLY SUGGESTED STAFF SUGGEST THAT WE APPROVE IS REQUESTED GOOD LUCK ON KEEPING THOSE COSTS LOW I'M LET'S OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING.
