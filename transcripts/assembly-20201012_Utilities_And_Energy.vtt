COLLECTIVELY ENERGY REGULATORS

00:40:58.722 --> 00:41:00.024
FAILED TO ANTICIPATE THIS

00:41:00.090 --> 00:41:01.826
EVENT AND TO TAKE NECESSARY

00:41:01.892 --> 00:41:03.360
ACTIONS TO ENSURE RELIABLE

00:41:03.427 --> 00:41:05.696
POWER TO CALIFORNIANS THE

00:41:05.763 --> 00:41:07.097
ENERGY PRINCIPLES BEFORE US

00:41:07.164 --> 00:41:09.033
TODAY HAVE RIGHTFULLY ASSUME

00:41:09.099 --> 00:41:11.035
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE HARDSHIP

00:41:11.101 --> 00:41:12.436
THAT MANY OF THE STATE AND

00:41:12.503 --> 00:41:14.338
TOURED WHEN THE BROAD SCALE

00:41:14.405 --> 00:41:16.207
ROTATED OUT AS OCCURRED IN MID

00:41:16.273 --> 00:41:18.676
AUGUST WE HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE

00:41:18.742 --> 00:41:19.977
FOR NOT JUST IDENTIFYING

00:41:20.044 --> 00:41:21.679
THE SHORTCOMINGS BUT MOST

00:41:21.745 --> 00:41:23.447
IMPORTANTLY TO PROPERLY AND

00:41:51.175 --> 00:41:52.776
BEFORE TURNING TO OUR WITNESSES

00:41:52.843 --> 00:41:55.045
AND TO AVOID CONFUSION IT IS

00:41:55.112 --> 00:41:56.347
IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT TODAY'S

00:41:56.413 --> 00:41:58.482
HEARING IS FOCUSED ON ROTATING

00:41:58.549 --> 00:42:01.051
OUTAGES THESE ARE OUTAGES

00:42:01.118 --> 00:42:04.388
THAT ARE CONTROLLED TO ROTATE

00:42:04.455 --> 00:42:07.024
FROM AREA TO AREA SO NO SINGLE

00:42:07.091 --> 00:42:08.459
NEIGHBORHOODS ELECTRICITY IS

00:42:08.525 --> 00:42:09.760
DOWN FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD

00:42:09.827 --> 00:42:11.829
OF TIME THERE ARE GENERALLY

00:42:11.896 --> 00:42:14.865
THREE OTHER TYPES OF OUTAGES

00:42:14.932 --> 00:42:16.734
FIRST LOCAL DISTRIBUTION

00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:18.636
FAILURES OR OUTAGES THAT MAY

00:42:18.702 --> 00:42:21.005
OCCUR AT LOCALIZED LEVEL WHEN

00:42:21.071 --> 00:42:23.007
THERE'S EQUIPMENT FAILURE

00:42:23.073 --> 00:42:25.409
SECOND PUBLIC SAFETY PUBLIC

S. P. S. S. B. S.

00:42:31.181 --> 00:42:32.583
OUTAGES ARE DELIBERATE

00:42:32.650 --> 00:42:34.118
BLACKOUTS ENGINEERED BY AN

00:42:34.184 --> 00:42:35.653
INVESTOR OWNED UTILITY OR

00:42:35.719 --> 00:42:37.655
MUNICIPAL UTILITY TO REDUCE

00:42:37.721 --> 00:42:40.991
WILDFIRE RISK AS INVESTOR

00:42:41.058 --> 00:42:42.393
OWNED UTILITIES AND MUNICIPAL

00:42:42.459 --> 00:42:43.427
UTILITIES HARDEN THEIR

00:42:43.494 --> 00:42:45.129
INFRASTRUCTURE THESE PS PS

00:42:45.195 --> 00:42:46.397
EVENTS WILL BE SMALLER IN

00:42:46.463 --> 00:42:49.500
SIZE AND SHORTER IN LENGTH

00:42:49.566 --> 00:42:51.769
FINALLY CASCADIAN UNCONTROLLED

00:42:51.835 --> 00:42:53.737
OUTAGES CAN RESULT IN MASSIVE

00:42:53.804 --> 00:42:55.172
DISRUPTIONS TO ELECTRICITY

00:42:55.239 --> 00:42:58.208
SERVICE FOR EXAMPLE THE TWO

00:42:58.275 --> 00:42:59.743
THOUSAND THREE NORTHEASTERN

00:42:59.810 --> 00:43:01.745
BLACKOUT WAS TRIGGERED BY A

00:43:01.812 --> 00:43:03.547
SERIES OF FAULTS CAUSED BY TREE

00:43:03.614 --> 00:43:05.950
BRANCHES TOUCHING POWER LINES

00:43:06.016 --> 00:43:08.686
IN OHIO HUMAN ERROR SOFTWARE

00:43:08.752 --> 00:43:10.187
ISSUES AND EQUIPMENT FAILURES

00:43:10.254 --> 00:43:11.755
LED TO THE MOST WIDESPREAD

00:43:11.822 --> 00:43:12.990
BLACKOUT IN NORTH AMERICAN

00:43:13.057 --> 00:43:15.459
HISTORY MORE THAN FIFTY MILLION

00:43:15.526 --> 00:43:17.528
PEOPLE ACROSS A NORTHEASTERN US

00:43:17.594 --> 00:43:18.963
STATES AND PARTS OF CANADA WERE

00:43:19.029 --> 00:43:20.831
LEFT WITHOUT POWER FOR AT LEAST

00:43:20.898 --> 00:43:22.666
TWENTY FOUR HOURS AND MANY OF

00:43:22.733 --> 00:43:25.369
THEM WERE IN THE DARK FOR WEEKS

00:43:25.436 --> 00:43:27.438
IS IMPORTANT TO STRESS THAT A

00:43:27.504 --> 00:43:29.840
RELIABLE POWER SYSTEM UNDERPINS

00:43:29.907 --> 00:43:32.376
OUR ECONOMY AND QUALITY OF LIFE

00:43:32.443 --> 00:43:34.445
CAREFUL PLANNING TO GUARANTEE

00:43:34.511 --> 00:43:35.846
ADEQUATE POWER SUPPLIES

MODELING OF SYSTEMS UNDER

00:43:37.681 --> 00:43:39.416
MERIT OF STRESS CONDITIONS

00:43:39.483 --> 00:43:40.951
HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY

00:43:41.018 --> 00:43:42.086
IMPORTANT AS CALIFORNIA

00:43:42.152 --> 00:43:43.821
MOVES TOWARD SIXTY PERCENT

00:43:50.794 --> 00:43:54.365
LAW THE ENERGY ORGANIZATIONS

00:43:54.431 --> 00:43:55.632
HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY TO

00:43:55.699 --> 00:43:58.002
SEEMINGLY SEAMLESSLY OPERATE

00:43:58.068 --> 00:43:59.370
THE GREAT DURING THE AUGUST

00:43:59.436 --> 00:44:01.739
AND SEPTEMBER HEAT WAVE WE LOOK

00:44:01.805 --> 00:44:02.740
FORWARD TO HEARING FROM THE

00:44:02.806 --> 00:44:04.208
WITNESSES ABOUT THE ACTIONS

00:44:04.274 --> 00:44:06.643
THEY UNDERTAKE THEY UNDERTAKEN

00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:08.612
TO ENSURE THAT ROTATING OUTAGES

00:44:08.679 --> 00:44:11.682
DO NOT HAPPEN AGAIN WITH THAT

00:44:11.749 --> 00:44:13.817
LET ME TURN TO OUR VICE CHAIR

00:44:13.884 --> 00:44:15.886
ASSEMBLY MEMBER PATTERSON FOR

00:44:15.953 --> 00:44:18.122
A FEW MOMENTS OF OPENING COSTS

00:44:18.188 --> 00:44:20.257
THANK YOU UP MISTER CHAIR UP

00:44:20.324 --> 00:44:23.660
I SPENT THE WEEKEND LOOKING

00:44:23.727 --> 00:44:26.196
CAREFULLY AT THE PRELIMINARY

00:44:26.263 --> 00:44:28.699
ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS AND I MUST

00:44:28.766 --> 00:44:31.835
SAY I AM NOT DISAPPOINTED I

00:44:31.902 --> 00:44:34.605
FIND THAT IT IS -- ESSENTIALLY

00:44:34.671 --> 00:44:37.341
DEFENSIVE -- THERE'S A LOT

00:44:37.408 --> 00:44:39.209
OF -- POINTING FINGERS AND

00:44:39.276 --> 00:44:44.148
SORT OF A -- BLAME -- EXCUSES

00:44:44.214 --> 00:44:49.520
AND SHORT ON SOLUTIONS

00:44:49.586 --> 00:44:51.021
WE ARE WE ARE SAYING IN THE

00:44:51.088 --> 00:44:53.791
SENSE THAT THIS OUTAGE WAS A

00:44:53.857 --> 00:44:55.292
RESULT OF A THIRTY FIVE YEAR

00:44:55.359 --> 00:44:57.828
HEAT EVENT WE KNOW THAT THAT

00:44:57.895 --> 00:44:59.430
IS NOT ACCURATE TWO THOUSAND

00:44:59.496 --> 00:45:01.565
AND SIX WE HAD A SIMILAR EVENT

00:45:01.632 --> 00:45:03.067
WITH SIMILAR HEAT THERE WERE NO

00:45:03.133 --> 00:45:06.170
BLACKOUTS AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT

00:45:06.236 --> 00:45:08.305
MIX OF ELECTRONS WERE ON THE

00:45:08.372 --> 00:45:11.008
GRID AT THAT TIME THIS REPORT

00:45:11.075 --> 00:45:13.010
ALSO HINTS OR MORE DIRECTLY

00:45:13.077 --> 00:45:16.580
POINTS AT MARKET FAILURE OF

00:45:16.647 --> 00:45:19.450
COURSE IT DID OTHER STATES

00:45:19.516 --> 00:45:20.918
AND REGIONS ARE NOT GOING

00:45:20.984 --> 00:45:22.252
TO SHIP THEIR ALECTRA WANTS

00:45:22.319 --> 00:45:25.522
TO CALIFORNIA TO BAIL US OUT

00:45:25.589 --> 00:45:27.124
THEY HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO

00:45:27.191 --> 00:45:29.626
THEIR PEOPLE THIS REPORT HINTS

00:45:29.693 --> 00:45:32.563
AT SOME LIMITED GENERATION

00:45:32.629 --> 00:45:35.566
IN THE FUTURE HECK WE NEED

00:45:35.632 --> 00:45:38.802
ADDITIONAL GENERATION NOW FOR

00:45:38.869 --> 00:45:40.204
THE TIMES WHEN CALIFORNIANS

00:45:40.270 --> 00:45:42.940
NEED IT THE MOST I FIND THE

00:45:43.006 --> 00:45:46.677
SUGGESTIONS RATHER FLIMSY

00:45:46.743 --> 00:45:47.911
IT DOES NOT INCLUDE AN

00:45:47.978 --> 00:45:50.547
ADEQUATE ADDITIONAL A PLAN

00:45:50.614 --> 00:45:54.284
FOR GENERATION NOW BUT IT IS

00:45:54.351 --> 00:45:57.521
FULL OF A LOT OF EUPHEMISMS

00:45:57.588 --> 00:46:01.458
EUPHEMISMS LIKE DEMAND RESPONSE

00:46:01.525 --> 00:46:02.960
TO ME THAT IS A EUPHEMISM THAT

00:46:03.026 --> 00:46:06.029
DESCRIBES VOLUNTARY BROWNOUTS

00:46:06.096 --> 00:46:07.698
THE THROTTLING BACK OF THE

00:46:07.764 --> 00:46:10.067
CALIFORNIA ECONOMY BECAUSE

00:46:10.134 --> 00:46:13.270
OF INADEQUATE SUPPLY ANOTHER

00:46:13.337 --> 00:46:16.507
EUPHEMISM IS TIME OF USE RATES

00:46:16.573 --> 00:46:18.408
TO YOUR FURNACE A EUPHEMISM

00:46:18.475 --> 00:46:21.445
FOR PRICING ELECTRONS SO HIGH

00:46:21.512 --> 00:46:23.013
THE CALIFORNIANS CANNOT AFFORD

00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:24.982
TO USE THEM WHEN THEY NEED

00:46:25.048 --> 00:46:28.018
THEM THE MOST ARE WE HEAR

00:46:28.085 --> 00:46:30.921
TALK ABOUT MICRO GRIDS WELL

00:46:30.988 --> 00:46:33.257
LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT ONE

00:46:33.323 --> 00:46:34.958
SCHNEIDER ELECTRIC HAS A LARGE

00:46:35.025 --> 00:46:36.927
PRESENCE IN MY DISTRICT THEY

00:46:36.994 --> 00:46:38.529
JUST RECEIVED A LARGE CONTRACT

00:46:38.595 --> 00:46:39.796
TO DEVELOP A MICROGRID FOR

00:46:39.863 --> 00:46:42.166
THE PORT OF LONG BEACH HERE

00:46:42.232 --> 00:46:44.067
IS THE MIX OF ELECTRONS IN A

00:46:44.134 --> 00:46:47.571
QUOTE SUSTAINABLE MICROGRID

00:46:47.638 --> 00:46:49.039
THREE HUNDRED KILOWATTS OF

00:46:49.106 --> 00:46:51.375
SOLAR TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY

00:46:51.441 --> 00:46:53.944
KILOWATTS OF BATTERY CAPACITY

00:46:54.011 --> 00:46:57.748
AN FIVE HUNDRED KILOWATTS OF

00:46:57.814 --> 00:47:01.118
DIESEL LET THAT SINK IN FOR

00:47:01.185 --> 00:47:03.787
A MOMENT THE NECESSITY OF

00:47:03.854 --> 00:47:06.123
DIESEL TO MAKE A MICROGRID

00:47:06.190 --> 00:47:09.693
SYSTEM FUNCTION NOW WE HAVE

00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:11.728
TO ADD TO THE DEMAND SIDE

00:47:11.795 --> 00:47:16.066
THE POLITICS OF ELECTRICITY

00:47:16.133 --> 00:47:18.135
ELECTRIFYING EVERY WHEEL THAT

00:47:18.202 --> 00:47:20.003
ROLLS HAS BEEN A SLOGAN AROUND

00:47:20.070 --> 00:47:22.439
HERE WE BANNED THE INTERNET AT

00:47:22.506 --> 00:47:25.209
THE INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE

00:47:25.275 --> 00:47:27.844
WE ELECTRIFY BUILDINGS WITHOUT

00:47:27.911 --> 00:47:31.582
NATURAL GAS ELECTRIFY HOMES

00:47:31.648 --> 00:47:34.618
WITHOUT NATURAL GAS AND EVEN

00:47:34.685 --> 00:47:36.253
THE THOUGHT OF ELECTRIFYING

00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:38.021
RESTAURANTS WITHOUT NATURAL

00:47:38.088 --> 00:47:41.258
GAS WE USED TO HAVE A GRID THAT

00:47:41.325 --> 00:47:43.927
WAS AFFORDABLE RELIABLE AND

00:47:43.994 --> 00:47:45.996
AVAILABLE WHEN CALIFORNIANS

00:47:46.063 --> 00:47:48.432
NEEDED IT EVEN IN TIMES OF A

00:47:48.498 --> 00:47:50.534
HEAT WAVE LIKE TO GRID IN TWO

00:47:50.601 --> 00:47:53.237
THOUSAND AND SIX TODAY WE HAVE

00:47:53.303 --> 00:47:55.272
AGREED THAT IS INCREASINGLY

00:47:55.339 --> 00:47:58.709
EXPENSIVE UNRELIABLE AND

00:47:58.775 --> 00:48:00.544
UNAVAILABLE WHEN THE PEOPLE

00:48:00.611 --> 00:48:03.647
OF CALIFORNIA NEEDED THE MOST

00:48:03.714 --> 00:48:05.349
WE ARE SUGGESTING SOMEHOW THAT

00:48:05.415 --> 00:48:07.217
THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA SHOULD

00:48:07.284 --> 00:48:09.953
FORGO USE OF ELECTRICITY THAT

00:48:10.020 --> 00:48:12.389
THREE OR FOUR OR FIVE OR SIX

00:48:12.456 --> 00:48:15.058
OR NINE OR TEN O'CLOCK THAT

00:48:15.125 --> 00:48:16.593
IS WHEN PEOPLE ARE COMING HOME

00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:18.228
FROM WORK WHEN THEY'RE PLANNING

00:48:18.295 --> 00:48:19.896
THEIR NEXT DAY AND WHEN THE

00:48:19.963 --> 00:48:21.365
PROMISE OF THE CALIFORNIA

00:48:21.431 --> 00:48:23.200
GRID HAS BEEN TO THEM

00:48:23.267 --> 00:48:25.269
ELECTRICITY WILL BE AVAILABLE

00:48:25.335 --> 00:48:28.272
AND AFFORDABLE WHEN YOU NEED

00:48:28.338 --> 00:48:30.007
AND HERE IS THE IRONY OF

00:48:30.073 --> 00:48:33.377
WHERE WE ARE TODAY CALIFORNIA

00:48:33.443 --> 00:48:35.579
HAS CREATED TWO CLASSES OF

00:48:35.646 --> 00:48:39.016
ELECTRONS ONE CLASS IS MORAL

00:48:39.082 --> 00:48:41.985
AND ANOTHER CLASSES IN MORE

00:48:42.052 --> 00:48:43.954
WE ARE THROTTLING DOWN OR

00:48:44.021 --> 00:48:47.190
SHUTTING DOWN OR CLOSING THE

00:48:47.257 --> 00:48:49.993
KIND OF IMMORAL ELECTRONS THAT

00:48:50.060 --> 00:48:53.063
THE STATE HAS CATEGORIZED AND

00:48:53.130 --> 00:48:54.698
THE MORAL ELECTRONS HAVE BEEN

00:48:54.765 --> 00:48:58.568
LETTING US DOWN AND YET IT

00:48:58.635 --> 00:49:00.537
HAS BEEN THOSE VERY IMMORAL

00:49:00.604 --> 00:49:02.506
ELECTRONS THAT HAVE BEEN

00:49:02.572 --> 00:49:03.807
THE ONES THAT WE HAVE HAD

AND STRESSED GRID CONDITIONS

00:58:13.890 --> 00:58:16.092
DURING THE AUGUST HEAT STORM

00:58:16.159 --> 00:58:17.694
FIRST THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT

00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:18.528
HEAD OF THAT WHICH I'VE

00:58:18.595 --> 00:58:20.663
DISCUSSED OUR CURRENT PROCESSES

00:58:20.730 --> 00:58:22.599
ARE BASED ON PLANNING FOR THE

00:58:22.665 --> 00:58:24.434
AVERAGE WEATHER YEARS WITH

00:58:24.500 --> 00:58:26.002
SOME ADDITIONAL QUESTION TO

00:58:26.069 --> 00:58:27.670
ACCOUNT FOR A RELATIVELY HIGHER

00:58:27.737 --> 00:58:29.873
TEMPERATURES BUT NOTHING LIKE

00:58:29.939 --> 00:58:32.809
THIS TO STAINED EXTREME WESTERN

00:58:32.876 --> 00:58:35.178
STATE HEAT STORM WE EXPERIENCED

00:58:35.245 --> 00:58:36.679
THIS WAS INDEED A ONE AND

00:58:36.746 --> 00:58:38.548
THIRTY FIVE YEAR OF THAT IN

00:58:38.615 --> 00:58:40.683
PART BECAUSE OF THE SUSTAINED

00:58:40.750 --> 00:58:43.186
DAY DAYS THAT EXPERIENCED

00:58:43.253 --> 00:58:45.221
THE THE HIGH TEMPERATURES

00:58:45.288 --> 00:58:46.823
WE ARE EVOLVING OUR PLANNING

00:58:46.890 --> 00:58:48.458
SO CALIFORNIA IS PREPARED

00:58:48.524 --> 00:58:50.660
FOR THESE TYPES OF EVENTS

00:58:50.727 --> 00:58:52.228
SECOND ARE PLANNING TARGETS

00:58:52.295 --> 00:58:53.930
HAVE NOT KEPT PACE TO PROCURE

00:58:53.997 --> 00:58:55.798
SUFFICIENT RESOURCES THAT CAN

00:58:55.865 --> 00:58:57.500
BE RELIED UPON TO MEET DEMAND

00:58:57.567 --> 00:58:59.769
IN THE EARLY EVENING HOURS

00:58:59.836 --> 00:59:01.337
SO THE SUPPLY AND THE DEMAND

00:59:01.404 --> 00:59:03.339
WAS EVEN TIGHTER IN THE EARLY

00:59:03.406 --> 00:59:05.408
EVENING WHEN AIR CONDITIONER

00:59:05.475 --> 00:59:07.410
DEMAND REMAINED HIGH BUT THE

00:59:07.477 --> 00:59:10.380
SELLER WAS TAPERING OFF FAST

00:59:10.446 --> 00:59:12.181
WITH THE TRANSITION TO A CLEAN

00:59:12.248 --> 00:59:14.117
ENERGY MIX WE HAVE MADE SOME

00:59:14.183 --> 00:59:15.385
ADJUSTMENTS TO OUR PLANNING

00:59:15.451 --> 00:59:17.053
PROCESS BUT NOT ENOUGH TO

00:59:17.120 --> 00:59:19.088
FULLY ACCOUNT FOR MAKING ENOUGH

00:59:19.155 --> 00:59:20.890
RESOURCES AVAILABLE DURING

00:59:20.957 --> 00:59:23.593
THAT NET EVENING PEAK DURING AN

00:59:23.660 --> 00:59:26.362
EXTREME AND SUSTAINED HE EVENT

00:59:26.429 --> 00:59:27.830
PRESENT AT HER IF I COULD I'M

00:59:27.897 --> 00:59:29.499
SORRY TO INTERRUPT YOU BUT I

00:59:29.565 --> 00:59:32.502
I THINK IF THERE SEEMS TO BE

00:59:32.568 --> 00:59:34.170
DIFFICULTY IN HEARING YOU FOR

00:59:34.237 --> 00:59:36.539
SOME WHO ARE NOT US BUT WHO

00:59:36.606 --> 00:59:39.542
ARE WATCHING AND SO IF MAYBE

00:59:39.609 --> 00:59:40.843
YOU CAN TRY TO GET A LITTLE

00:59:40.910 --> 00:59:42.178
CLOSER TO THE MICROPHONE AND

00:59:42.245 --> 00:59:43.913
SEE IF THAT CAN OKAY MAKE A

00:59:43.980 --> 00:59:48.651
DIFFERENCE I'M SORRY THANK YOU

00:59:48.718 --> 00:59:51.087
OKAY FINALLY SOME DAY AHEAD

00:59:51.154 --> 00:59:52.889
MARKET PRACTICES MASS THE

00:59:52.956 --> 00:59:54.590
FULL LEVEL OF DEMAND LEADING

00:59:54.657 --> 00:59:57.694
TO A HIGHER AMOUNT OF EXPORTS

00:59:57.760 --> 00:59:59.729
HI AT CAL AYSO CAN ADDRESS

00:59:59.796 --> 01:00:01.431
THESE IN MORE DETAIL LATER

01:00:01.497 --> 01:00:02.899
IN THE PRESENTATION BUT

01:00:02.966 --> 01:00:04.000
THERE WERE SOME CONCERNS

01:00:04.067 --> 01:00:05.768
WITH UNDER SCHEDULING IN

01:00:05.835 --> 01:00:08.204
THE DAY AHEAD MARKET MASKED

01:00:08.271 --> 01:00:12.809
BY CONVERGENT BIDDING

01:00:12.875 --> 01:00:15.812
-- WITH THAT OF THE OVERVIEW

01:00:15.878 --> 01:00:17.413
MISTER CHAIR I WOULD LIKE

01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:21.784

MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- LET

01:00:33.696 --> 01:00:35.098
ME FIRST JUST REITERATE WHAT

01:00:35.164 --> 01:00:36.833
HAPPENED ON AUGUST FOURTEENTH

01:00:36.899 --> 01:00:39.369
AND FIFTEENTH IS UNACCEPTABLE

01:00:39.435 --> 01:00:40.737
TO ME PERSONALLY TO ALL OF US

01:00:40.803 --> 01:00:41.904
OF THE ENERGY AGENCIES TO THE

01:00:41.971 --> 01:00:43.306
GOVERNOR YOU KNOW TO YOU AND

01:00:43.373 --> 01:00:45.675
TO THE PUBLIC WE OWN THAT AND

WE ARE ABSOLUTELY DEDICATED TO

01:00:47.710 --> 01:00:48.578
GETTING IT RIGHT AND I THINK

01:00:48.644 --> 01:00:50.279
THE BIG PICTURE MESSAGE HERE

01:00:50.346 --> 01:00:53.316
IS THAT THIS IS A SOLVABLE

01:00:53.383 --> 01:00:54.684
PROBLEM BUT LET ME SHOW YOU

01:00:54.751 --> 01:00:56.019
A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT WE'RE

01:00:56.085 --> 01:00:58.554
DEALING WITH NOW TO VICE CHAIR

01:00:58.621 --> 01:01:01.457
OF PATTERSON'S POINT THE STORM

01:01:01.524 --> 01:01:02.992
WE JUST HAD A DIFFERENT VERY

01:01:03.059 --> 01:01:03.793
DIFFERENT THAN THE ONE THAT

01:01:03.860 --> 01:01:05.328
HAPPENED FIFTEEN YEARS AGO

01:01:05.395 --> 01:01:06.596
AND AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THIS

01:01:06.662 --> 01:01:07.630
CHART THIS IS THE TEMPERATURE

01:01:07.697 --> 01:01:09.232
CURVES FOR THE LAST THIRTY

01:01:09.298 --> 01:01:11.067
FIVE YEARS IN CALIFORNIA IT'S

01:01:11.134 --> 01:01:12.668
NOT JUST THAT THE TEMPERATURES

01:01:12.735 --> 01:01:14.570
WERE HIGHER BUT THAT THEY THEY

01:01:14.637 --> 01:01:16.172
WERE EXTENDED OVER A FIVE DAY

01:01:16.239 --> 01:01:17.407
PERIOD AND THAT'S NOT JUST FOR

01:01:17.473 --> 01:01:19.442
CALIFORNIA BUT FOR THE ENTIRE

01:01:19.509 --> 01:01:20.410
WEST WHICH IS PART OF THE

01:01:20.476 --> 01:01:21.844
REASON WHY IMPORTS WERE CUT

01:01:21.911 --> 01:01:23.513
IN HALF I WOULD JUST REMIND

01:01:23.579 --> 01:01:26.549
EVERYBODY THE HIGHEST RELIABLY

01:01:26.616 --> 01:01:28.651
RECORDED TEMPERATURE IN WORLD

01:01:28.718 --> 01:01:30.887
HISTORY HAPPENED IN AUGUST

01:01:30.953 --> 01:01:32.889
DURING THIS HEAT STORM IN DEATH

01:01:32.955 --> 01:01:34.757
VALLEY HUNDRED THIRTY DEGREES

01:01:34.824 --> 01:01:36.392
AND SO THIS IS THE NEW WORLD

01:01:36.459 --> 01:01:37.727
THAT WORK IN AND WE HAVE TO

01:01:37.794 --> 01:01:39.529
CALIBRATE TO IT BUT JUST TO TO

01:01:39.595 --> 01:01:41.864
LEVEL SET -- WE HAVE A SENSE

01:01:41.931 --> 01:01:45.701
OF WHAT THE DYNAMICS WHERE

WAY FOR AS NOTED THE CALIFORNIA

01:02:58.574 --> 01:03:00.009
ISO IS A NOT FOR PROFIT PUBLIC

THE OUTAGES THAT OCCURRED

01:03:20.963 --> 01:03:22.265
IN AUGUST AND THE SUBSEQUENT

CONDITIONS FELT ACROSS THE WEST

01:03:29.005 --> 01:03:30.406
INCREASING DEMAND WAS LARGELY

01:03:30.473 --> 01:03:31.774
ATTRIBUTED TO HEAT PATTERNS OR

01:03:31.841 --> 01:03:33.409
CLOSER TO ONE THIRTY FIVE YOUR

01:03:33.476 --> 01:03:35.745
WEATHER CURRENTS THIS PLACE A

01:03:35.811 --> 01:03:37.647
STRAIN ON ENERGY CONSUMPTION

01:03:37.713 --> 01:03:39.348
LARGELY DUE TO INCREASED AIR

01:03:39.415 --> 01:03:40.650
CONDITIONING USE ACROSS THE

01:03:40.716 --> 01:03:43.753
STATE GET THE QUESTION IS

01:03:43.819 --> 01:03:45.821
NOT HOW UNUSUAL WHERE THESE

01:03:45.888 --> 01:03:47.290
EVENTS IN THE PAST TEN YEARS

01:03:47.356 --> 01:03:49.592
BUT HOW UNUSUAL THEY WILL LOOK

01:03:49.659 --> 01:03:52.562
TEN YEARS FROM NOW WHILE WE

01:03:52.628 --> 01:03:54.096
CANNOT PREDICT THE EXACT WAYS

01:03:54.163 --> 01:03:55.765
CLIMATE CHANGE WILL IMPACT OUR

01:03:55.831 --> 01:03:57.833
ENERGY NEEDS WE AT LEAST HAVE

01:03:57.900 --> 01:03:59.535
SOLID INDICATORS SUGGESTING

01:03:59.602 --> 01:04:02.438
THE PATH FORWARD AND THESE

01:04:02.505 --> 01:04:04.407
INDICATORS DEMONSTRATE A FEW

01:04:04.473 --> 01:04:07.743
LESSONS RENEWABLES WERE NOT THE

01:04:07.810 --> 01:04:10.379
PROBLEM OUR GOALS OF REDUCING

01:04:10.446 --> 01:04:12.815
GHG CAN BE MET BUT REQUIRES

01:04:12.882 --> 01:04:14.817
PLANNING AROUND CHALLENGES AND

01:04:14.884 --> 01:04:16.953
RESPECTING THAT THESE RESOURCES

01:04:17.019 --> 01:04:18.854
ARE MORE VOLATILE VOLATILE

01:04:18.921 --> 01:04:21.257
THAN OTHERS DOESN'T MAKE THEM

01:04:21.324 --> 01:04:23.259
BAD IT JUST MEANS THAT WE HAVE

01:04:23.326 --> 01:04:25.928
TO PLAN AROUND THOSE FACTORS

01:04:25.995 --> 01:04:27.530
WE NEED ENERGY RESOURCES WITH

01:04:27.597 --> 01:04:28.965
FLEXIBLE CHARACTERISTICS TO

01:04:29.031 --> 01:04:31.267
ADDRESS THE NET DEMAND PEAK

01:04:31.334 --> 01:04:34.503
WHICH OCCURS LATER IN THE DAY

01:04:34.570 --> 01:04:36.639
AND I WOULD ALSO SUGGEST THAT

01:04:36.706 --> 01:04:37.940
WE NEED EXPANDED PARTNERSHIPS

01:04:38.007 --> 01:04:39.308
AND COLLABORATION WITH OTHER

01:04:39.375 --> 01:04:41.143
STATES WHERE POSSIBLE AND

01:04:41.210 --> 01:04:44.447
SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED BUT UNTIL

01:04:44.513 --> 01:04:45.815
THEN WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE

01:04:45.881 --> 01:04:47.083
TO HAVE TO COMPETE WITH THEM

01:04:47.149 --> 01:04:49.685
FOR RESOURCES I BELIEVE THE

01:04:49.752 --> 01:04:51.988
CHALLENGES THESE PAST FEW

01:04:52.054 --> 01:04:54.223
MONTHS ARE OF NORMAL BUT NOT A

01:04:54.290 --> 01:04:56.492
FLUKE THE LESSONS LEARNED AND

01:04:56.559 --> 01:04:58.327
DISCUSS TODAY CAN LEAD TO A

01:04:58.394 --> 01:05:00.162
DECARBONISE GRID THAT MAINTAINS

01:05:00.229 --> 01:05:01.430
RELIABILITY CALIFORNIANS

01:05:01.497 --> 01:05:02.565
HAVE COME TO EXPECT IN THE

01:05:02.632 --> 01:05:05.401
PAST TWO DECADES THE ISO IS

01:05:05.468 --> 01:05:06.836
COMMITTED TO ENHANCING OUR

01:05:06.902 --> 01:05:08.938
MARKET PRACTICES WE'VE NOTED

01:05:09.005 --> 01:05:10.573
MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THIS TO

01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:12.241
ENSURE THEY ACCURATELY REFLECT

01:05:12.308 --> 01:05:14.110
THE ACTUAL BALANCE OF SUPPLY

01:05:14.176 --> 01:05:15.511
AND DEMAND DURING STRESSED

01:05:15.578 --> 01:05:18.247
OPERATING CONDITIONS I WANT TO

01:05:18.314 --> 01:05:19.548
THANK THE AFTER THE COMMITTEE

01:05:19.615 --> 01:05:20.916
FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TESTIFIED

01:05:20.983 --> 01:05:23.219
TODAY I ALSO WANNA NOTE THAT

01:05:23.286 --> 01:05:25.087
WITH ME IS MARKED ROTH LEADER

01:05:25.154 --> 01:05:26.389
UP IN THE GALLERY HIS V.

01:05:26.455 --> 01:05:28.391
P. OF MARK POLICY PERFORMANCE

01:05:28.457 --> 01:05:29.892
HE'LL BE ABLE ANSWER MORE

01:05:29.959 --> 01:05:32.695
DETAILED QUESTIONS IF I CAN

01:05:32.762 --> 01:05:35.031
THEN GO TO THE SLIDE THE SLIDE

01:05:35.097 --> 01:05:37.633
FOR YOU WHICH IS ON PAGE FIVE

01:05:37.700 --> 01:05:39.335
IT SHOWS THE CONDITIONS THAT

01:05:39.402 --> 01:05:41.937
EXISTED -- ON THE FOURTEENTH

01:05:42.004 --> 01:05:44.607
AND FIFTEENTH AND THE LITTLE

01:05:44.674 --> 01:05:47.009
TWO LINES THE BLUE LINE RECORD

01:05:47.076 --> 01:05:49.779
REPRESENTS ACTUAL DEMAND

01:05:49.845 --> 01:05:51.480
THE YELLOW OR ORANGE LINE

01:05:51.547 --> 01:05:53.516
REPRESENTS WHAT WE CALLED NET

01:05:53.582 --> 01:05:55.518
DEMAND THAT IS DEMAND ON THE

01:05:55.584 --> 01:05:57.753
SYSTEM AFTER YOU EXTRACT WIND

01:05:57.820 --> 01:05:59.088
AND SOLAR PRODUCTION FROM

01:05:59.155 --> 01:06:01.257
THE SYSTEM AND WHAT THAT DOES

01:06:01.324 --> 01:06:02.958
IS IT GIVES US A VERY GOOD

01:06:03.025 --> 01:06:04.860
POINT OF HOW MUCH HAS TO BE

01:06:04.927 --> 01:06:07.563
SUPPORTED BY NON RENEWABLE

01:06:07.630 --> 01:06:09.432
RESOURCES OR A PARTICULAR NON

01:06:09.498 --> 01:06:10.866
SOLAR RESOURCES IN THE EVENING

01:06:10.933 --> 01:06:13.669
HOURS WE HAD STATES THREE

01:06:13.736 --> 01:06:15.671
EMERGENCIES WHICH MANDATES ON

01:06:15.738 --> 01:06:17.807
BOTH OF THOSE DAYS WHICH MEANT

01:06:17.873 --> 01:06:20.109
THAT ARE OPERATING RESERVES

01:06:20.176 --> 01:06:22.044
WERE LESS THAN NECESSARY TO

01:06:22.111 --> 01:06:24.914
MEET SYSTEM RELIABILITY NEEDS

01:06:24.980 --> 01:06:27.850
THE GRAY LINES INDICATE THE

01:06:27.917 --> 01:06:30.586
TIME AT WHICH WE WERE IN STAGE

01:06:30.653 --> 01:06:33.255
THREE EMERGENCY CONDITIONS I

01:06:33.322 --> 01:06:36.258
WAS ON THE CONTROL ROOM FLOOR

01:06:36.325 --> 01:06:38.327
ON THE FOURTEENTH AND ON THE

01:06:38.394 --> 01:06:40.229
FIFTEENTH AND HAVE FIRST HAND

01:06:40.296 --> 01:06:41.564
KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT OCCURRED

01:06:41.630 --> 01:06:45.668
ON THOSE DAYS BOTH OF THE

01:06:45.735 --> 01:06:48.337
THE LOAD SHED EVENTS OCCURRED

01:06:48.404 --> 01:06:51.407
DURING NET PEAK EVENING HOURS

01:06:51.474 --> 01:06:54.310
NOT DURING THE PEAK OF THE DAY

01:06:54.377 --> 01:06:56.779
THIS IS A POINT THAT I THINK

01:06:56.846 --> 01:06:59.949
ISN'T VERY IMPORTANT FOR US

01:07:00.015 --> 01:07:02.385
THAT ARE SITTING BACK HERE TO

01:07:02.451 --> 01:07:05.087
GRAPPLE WITH AS WE PLAN FOR THE

01:07:05.154 --> 01:07:07.256
EVENING HOURS AFTER THE SOLAR

01:07:07.323 --> 01:07:10.493
HAS SET AN THE DISTRIBUTED

01:07:10.559 --> 01:07:13.129
ROOFTOP -- RESOURCES ARE

01:07:13.195 --> 01:07:16.298
GONE IS OUR CHALLENGE IF I

01:07:16.365 --> 01:07:22.938
CAN MOVE TO THE NEXT SLIDE

01:07:23.005 --> 01:07:25.207
WE NOTED -- AS WE DID AN

01:07:25.274 --> 01:07:27.343
ANALYSIS AND AND NOTED IN THE

01:07:27.410 --> 01:07:30.913
REPORT THAT UNDER SCHEDULING

01:07:30.980 --> 01:07:32.615
IN THE DAY AHEAD MARKET

01:07:32.681 --> 01:07:34.950
SIGNIFICANTLY EXACERBATED THIS

01:07:35.017 --> 01:07:37.720
ISSUE WE FOUND IF YOU LOOK

01:07:37.787 --> 01:07:39.355
AT THAT SLIDE YOU CAN SEE THE

01:07:39.422 --> 01:07:41.791
GRAY LINE IS THE LOW THAT WAS

01:07:41.857 --> 01:07:43.993
SCHEDULED WHEREAS THE ORANGE

01:07:44.059 --> 01:07:47.496
LINE WAS THE ACTUAL DEMAND

01:07:47.563 --> 01:07:49.965
-- WE ARE GOING TO BE LOOKING

01:07:50.032 --> 01:07:52.802
INTO THE SITUATION WHY THE

01:07:52.868 --> 01:07:54.403
LOAD SERVING ENTITIES ARE

01:07:54.470 --> 01:07:56.872
UNDER SCHEDULING IN THE MARKET

01:07:56.939 --> 01:07:59.008
AND TAKES STEPS COLLECTIVELY

01:07:59.074 --> 01:08:00.876
ACROSS OUR THREE ORGANIZATIONS

01:08:00.943 --> 01:08:03.879
TO ADDRESS THAT PROBLEM THIS

01:08:03.946 --> 01:08:08.117
CONTRIBUTED TO AN EX TO EXPORTS

01:08:08.184 --> 01:08:10.686
COME OUT OF OUR MARKET BECAUSE

01:08:10.753 --> 01:08:12.955
THE MARKET INDICATED THAT THE

01:08:13.022 --> 01:08:15.724
LOAD THAT CLEARED IS A GRAY

01:08:15.791 --> 01:08:17.927
LINE AND THE DIFFERENCE IS

01:08:17.993 --> 01:08:20.763
-- AVAILABLE TO EXPORT AND

01:08:20.830 --> 01:08:22.298
I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK ABOUT

01:08:22.364 --> 01:08:25.534
EXPORTS IN MORE -- ELABORATE

01:08:25.601 --> 01:08:28.204
TERMS AS WE MOVE ON BUT I WANT

01:08:28.270 --> 01:08:29.672
TO MAKE AN IMPORTANT POINT

01:08:29.738 --> 01:08:32.374
ABOUT EXPORTS BECAUSE PEOPLE

01:08:32.441 --> 01:08:33.843
HAVE ASKED ABOUT THAT WATER

01:08:33.909 --> 01:08:37.346
WE EXPORTING WELL FIRST OF ALL

01:08:37.413 --> 01:08:39.081
CALIFORNIA IS A NET IMPORTS

01:08:39.148 --> 01:08:40.616
STATE IN GENERAL WE IMPORT

01:08:40.683 --> 01:08:41.817
ABOUT TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF

01:08:41.884 --> 01:08:44.520
OUR POWER THE EXPORTS WERE

01:08:44.587 --> 01:08:48.390
LARGELY -- OR ARE A VERY HIGH

01:08:48.457 --> 01:08:50.259
PERCENTAGE WERE NON RESOURCE

01:08:50.326 --> 01:08:52.928
ADEQUACY RESOURCES THESE ARE

01:08:52.995 --> 01:08:55.364
PLANTS GENERATORS THEY'RE NOT

01:08:55.431 --> 01:08:57.066
UNDER ANY CONTRACT NOR ARE

01:08:57.132 --> 01:08:58.734
THEY UNDER ANY OBLIGATION TO

01:08:58.801 --> 01:09:00.803
SERVE LOADING CALIFORNIA AND

01:09:00.870 --> 01:09:02.638
IN A FREE MARKET THEY CAN SELL

01:09:02.705 --> 01:09:04.139
THEIR ELECTRONS TO THE HIGHEST

01:09:04.206 --> 01:09:07.510
BIDDER THE RESOURCE ADEQUACY

01:09:07.576 --> 01:09:09.278
OF RESOURCES ARE REQUIRED TO

01:09:09.345 --> 01:09:11.780
BEEN INDOOR MARKET AND THEY

01:09:11.847 --> 01:09:14.517
LARGELY DID AND THEY HELPED US

01:09:14.583 --> 01:09:19.021
MEET THAT NOW WIN YOUR IN A NET

01:09:19.088 --> 01:09:21.724
IMPORTER POSITION -- I THINK IT

01:09:21.790 --> 01:09:24.093
WOULD BE A VERY BAD PRACTICE TO

01:09:24.159 --> 01:09:25.694
CONSIDER CUTTING THESE EXPORTS

01:09:25.761 --> 01:09:27.830
AS A REGULAR SOLUTION TO THIS

01:09:27.897 --> 01:09:30.099
PROBLEM I'LL LEAVE IT THERE BUT

01:09:30.165 --> 01:09:32.535
I WILL COME BACK TO THAT I WILL

01:09:32.601 --> 01:09:36.305
THEN TURN -- -- IS A BETTER

01:09:36.372 --> 01:09:37.573
I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO START

01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:38.874
THE LAST SLIDE IS THAT NOT

01:09:38.941 --> 01:09:42.411
CORRECT YES SIR THAT'S RIGHT

01:09:42.478 --> 01:09:44.146
AND THE LAST SLIDE IS THE

01:09:44.213 --> 01:09:45.648
RECOMMENDED ACTIONS THAT WE

01:09:45.714 --> 01:09:48.050
WILL ALL BE TAKING SO TURN TO

01:09:48.117 --> 01:09:50.953
SLIDE SEVEN AND WE WILL EACH

01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:52.354
SPEAK TO SOME OF THESE BULLET

01:09:52.421 --> 01:09:55.391
POINTS FIRST AND FOREMOST THE

01:09:55.457 --> 01:09:57.526
THREE OF US WILL COORDINATE TO

01:09:57.593 --> 01:09:59.695
ENSURE THE TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED

01:09:59.762 --> 01:10:01.163
TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED MEGAWATTS

01:10:01.230 --> 01:10:03.098
OF RESOURCES THAT THE CPC

01:10:03.165 --> 01:10:04.833
HAS ALREADY DIRECTED TO BE

01:10:04.900 --> 01:10:07.269
PROCURED ARE IN DEVELOPMENT

01:10:07.336 --> 01:10:10.105
AND WILL BE ONLINE NEXT SUMMER

01:10:10.172 --> 01:10:12.441
THE CPUC ALSO PLANS TO OPEN

01:10:12.508 --> 01:10:14.944
AN EXPEDITED RULEMAKING TO

01:10:15.010 --> 01:10:17.179
ADDRESS RELIABILITY FOR SUMMER

01:10:17.246 --> 01:10:19.648
TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE ARE

01:10:19.715 --> 01:10:21.650
IDENTIFYING VARIOUS ACTIONS

01:10:21.717 --> 01:10:23.652
THAT WILL IMPROVE RELIABILITY

01:10:23.719 --> 01:10:24.987
IN THE SUMMER OF TWENTY TWENTY

01:10:25.054 --> 01:10:27.022
ONE RECOGNIZING THAT WHILE WE

01:10:27.089 --> 01:10:28.824
DO HAVE NEW RESOURCES COMING

01:10:28.891 --> 01:10:31.193
ON LINE DURING THAT PERIOD WE

01:10:31.260 --> 01:10:32.561
MAY STILL NEED TO DEAL WITH

01:10:32.628 --> 01:10:34.797
POTENTIAL SHORTFALL WE WILL

01:10:34.863 --> 01:10:37.232
BE LOOKING AT DEMAND RESPONSE

01:10:37.299 --> 01:10:39.401
OTHER LOAD SHIFTING OPTIONS AND

01:10:39.468 --> 01:10:41.270
OTHER RELIABILITY STEPS WE CAN

01:10:41.337 --> 01:10:43.572
TAKE RECOGNIZING THAT WE DO NOT

01:10:43.639 --> 01:10:45.274
HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO ORDER NEW

01:10:45.341 --> 01:10:47.476
SUPPLY SIDE RESOURCES BETWEEN

01:10:47.543 --> 01:10:49.778
NOW AND THIS COMING SUMMER IN

PROCEEDING WHICH IS ALREADY

01:11:02.124 --> 01:11:04.360
UNDERWAY WE EXPECT TO HAVE THAT

01:11:04.426 --> 01:11:06.595
DECISION READY FOR ADOPTION NO

01:18:55.063 --> 01:18:56.932
YES SIR YES SIR OKAY WE ARE

01:18:56.998 --> 01:18:59.134
AT THAT -- WELL FIRST OF ALL

01:18:59.201 --> 01:19:00.869
THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR BEING

01:19:00.936 --> 01:19:03.705
HERE THANK YOU FOR YOUR -- YOUR

YOUR HONESTY AND -- ACCEPTING

01:19:06.808 --> 01:19:09.277
THE RESPONSIBILITY I KNOW THAT

01:19:09.344 --> 01:19:11.379
FOR ALL OF OUR CONSTITUENTS IN

01:19:11.446 --> 01:19:13.348
THOSE MEMBERS WHO ARE NOT HERE

01:19:13.415 --> 01:19:15.083
THEIR CONSTITUENTS THE PEOPLE

01:19:15.150 --> 01:19:19.254
AROUND THE STATE -- -- THIS

01:19:19.321 --> 01:19:21.423
THAT WAS A REALLY TOUGH AT A

01:19:21.490 --> 01:19:24.593
TIME CLEARLY TO GO THROUGH AND

01:19:24.659 --> 01:19:26.628
YOU KNOW I MUST SAY THAT THE

01:19:26.695 --> 01:19:28.430
CONSERVATION EFFORT ON BEHALF

01:19:28.497 --> 01:19:29.931
OF THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE

01:19:29.998 --> 01:19:31.967
OF CALIFORNIA PLAYED A MAJOR

01:19:32.033 --> 01:19:34.769
ROLE IN KEEPING US FROM FOR OF

01:19:34.836 --> 01:19:38.607
DRIFTING OFF INTO THE ABYSS --

01:19:38.673 --> 01:19:42.377
BUT -- WE'RE NOW CONTINUE TO

01:19:42.444 --> 01:19:43.545
GET OUR ARMS AROUND WE COULD

01:19:43.612 --> 01:19:45.347
LOOK AT THIS AND MAYBE B.

01:19:45.413 --> 01:19:47.482
AS A THINKER ALLUDING TO BE

01:19:47.549 --> 01:19:49.151
INSTRUCTIVE FOR HOW WE GO

01:19:49.217 --> 01:19:51.520
FORWARD AND HOW WE ARE IN

01:19:51.586 --> 01:19:53.355
A MUCH BETTER POSITION TO

01:19:53.421 --> 01:19:56.458
FORECAST SOME OF THE ELEMENTS

01:19:56.525 --> 01:19:57.459
OF WHAT WE HAD TO DEAL WITH

01:19:57.526 --> 01:19:59.995
THIS YEAR EARLIER HOPEFULLY

01:20:00.061 --> 01:20:01.496
GOING INTO THE FUTURE PANDEMIC

01:20:01.563 --> 01:20:05.267
IS NOT PART OF OUR FUTURE --

01:20:05.333 --> 01:20:07.302
MUCH LONGER AND THAT CERTAINLY

01:20:07.369 --> 01:20:09.538
HAD OF ITS ROLE TO PLAY --

01:20:09.604 --> 01:20:11.873
BUT -- WE'RE HERE TODAY TO

01:20:11.940 --> 01:20:14.342
NOT ONLY BETTER UNDERSTAND

01:20:14.409 --> 01:20:15.877
WHAT HAPPENED BUT ALSO THE

01:20:15.944 --> 01:20:17.812
THING PROSPECTIVELY OF HOW WE

01:20:17.879 --> 01:20:19.548
CAN BE IN A STRONGER PLACE TO

01:20:19.614 --> 01:20:20.448
ENSURE THAT IT DOESN'T HAPPEN

01:20:20.515 --> 01:20:21.883
AGAIN SO I APPRECIATE YOUR

01:20:21.950 --> 01:20:23.919
PRESENTATIONS DR CORK I HAD

01:20:23.985 --> 01:20:25.387
INDICATED I WOULD TURN TO YOU

01:20:25.453 --> 01:20:28.456
TO LATER FOR QUESTIONS AND IF

01:20:28.523 --> 01:20:29.791
MEMBERS HAVE COURSES THAT THEY

01:20:29.858 --> 01:20:31.693
WOULD LIKE TO POSE AT THIS

01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:34.129
TIME THIS WOULD BE THE TIME

01:20:34.196 --> 01:20:37.799
DUCTWORK HELLO TO ALL THIS

01:20:37.866 --> 01:20:42.837
YEAH THE WELL THE VICE CHAIR

01:20:42.904 --> 01:20:45.507
MADE NO OPENING STATEMENT THAT

01:20:45.574 --> 01:20:47.742
IMPLIES THAT THE ONLY WAY TO

01:20:47.809 --> 01:20:49.978
SOLVE OUR PROBLEM WAS TO GIVE

01:20:50.045 --> 01:20:51.846
UP ONE OUR GOAL OF ONE HUNDRED

01:20:51.913 --> 01:20:53.315
PERCENT RENEWABLE ENERGY

01:20:53.381 --> 01:20:56.651
AND THAT'S JUST NOT THE CASE

01:20:56.718 --> 01:20:59.654
WE HAVE TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM

01:20:59.721 --> 01:21:02.123
WITH STORAGE WE'VE GOT PLENTY

01:21:02.190 --> 01:21:05.026
OF SUNSHINE PLENTY OF WIND

01:21:05.093 --> 01:21:06.962
WE CAN BUILD MORE IT'S NOT

01:21:07.028 --> 01:21:08.463
THAT EXPENSIVE BUT WE NEED

01:21:08.530 --> 01:21:11.666
TO STORE AND IT PORTAL NOT

01:21:11.733 --> 01:21:14.469
BECAUSE DID YOU SEE THAT

01:21:14.536 --> 01:21:16.938
ARE ONE TO TWO PERCENT THAT

01:21:17.005 --> 01:21:21.042
WE CONTRIBUTE TO THE GLOBAL

01:21:21.109 --> 01:21:23.612
PROBLEM OF GREENHOUSE GASES

01:21:23.678 --> 01:21:25.247
IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE HAVE

01:21:25.313 --> 01:21:27.349
TO SHOW THE REST OF THE WORLD

01:21:27.415 --> 01:21:29.150
THE REST OF THE UNITED STATES

01:21:29.217 --> 01:21:31.152
STATE BY STATE THIS CAN BE

01:21:31.219 --> 01:21:32.587
DONE AND WE CAN BE DONE AT A

01:21:32.654 --> 01:21:35.624
REASONABLE PRICE THAT WE CAN

01:21:35.690 --> 01:21:38.460
GET AWAY FROM FOSSIL FUELS NOW

01:21:38.526 --> 01:21:44.065
THAT THIS IS STORAGE ALL BREAK

01:21:44.132 --> 01:21:46.901
FOUR HOURS MAYBE EIGHT HOURS

01:21:46.968 --> 01:21:49.004
BUT THE SELF DISCHARGE THEY'RE

01:21:49.070 --> 01:21:50.138
NOT GOING TO BE GOOD FOR THE

01:21:50.205 --> 01:21:53.675
LONGER TERM FOR THE LONGER TERM

01:21:53.742 --> 01:21:56.278
WE'RE GONNA NEED FOR SORT OF A

01:21:56.344 --> 01:21:59.180
FEW DAYS YOU CAN DO THAT WITH

01:21:59.247 --> 01:22:03.251
I'M STORAGE OF THE NUMBER --

01:22:03.318 --> 01:22:05.287
WONDER WHEN YOU'VE GOT ACCESS

01:22:05.353 --> 01:22:07.289
ENERGY AND HAVING TO COME DOWN

01:22:07.355 --> 01:22:10.158
FOR HYDROPOWER BUT THAT'S A

01:22:10.225 --> 01:22:13.628
GOOD FOR A DAY OR TWO BUT IT'S

01:22:13.695 --> 01:22:16.665
THESE BATTERIES CAN THE NEXT

01:22:16.731 --> 01:22:20.235
SITUATION IS WHAT DO WE DO

01:22:20.302 --> 01:22:21.469
OUR FOR THE LONGER TERM FOR

01:22:21.536 --> 01:22:23.271
SEASONAL STORAGE N. M.

01:22:23.338 --> 01:22:25.507
HYDRO IS GOING TO GET TO THEIR

01:22:25.573 --> 01:22:26.675
I'VE LOOKED AT THE VARIOUS

01:22:26.741 --> 01:22:28.209
ALTERNATIVES I THINK THE WHITE

01:22:28.276 --> 01:22:30.912
ONE IS HYDROGEN OTHERS TO LOOK

01:22:30.979 --> 01:22:32.447
AT THIS THE POINT IS WE HAVE

01:22:32.514 --> 01:22:35.784
NO PLANS AT ALL AND WHATEVER

01:22:35.850 --> 01:22:37.352
THIS IS IT'S GOING TO TAKE

01:22:37.419 --> 01:22:39.254
YEARS TO FIRST OF ALL DEVELOP

01:22:39.321 --> 01:22:42.857
THE TECHNOLOGY FOR EXAMPLE

01:22:42.924 --> 01:22:45.627
HOW DO YOU IT EXPENSIVELY --

01:22:45.694 --> 01:22:50.298
GENERATED THE STORAGE HI AND

01:22:50.365 --> 01:22:52.300
HYDROGEN'S PAYS BY SPLITTING

01:22:52.367 --> 01:22:55.170
THE WATER ADAMS AND THEN HOW

01:22:55.236 --> 01:22:56.571
DO YOU STORE IT HOW DO YOU GET

01:22:56.638 --> 01:22:57.939
IT FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER

01:22:58.006 --> 01:23:01.042
WORDS NEEDED THAT'S TREMENDOUS

01:23:01.109 --> 01:23:02.777
AMOUNT DEVELOPMENT WORK AND NOT

01:23:02.844 --> 01:23:04.879
A WHOLE LOT OF IMPLEMENTATION

01:23:04.946 --> 01:23:08.049
WE THOUGHT ABOUT THE FIRST

01:23:08.116 --> 01:23:11.519
HYDRO BILLS ALL MAKE SURE

01:23:11.586 --> 01:23:14.055
THAT THESE NUMBERS RIGHT IN

01:23:14.122 --> 01:23:16.624
JULY TWENTY FIFTEEN THE ISL IN

01:23:16.691 --> 01:23:17.492
A LETTER TO THE C.

01:23:17.559 --> 01:23:20.295
P. U. C. REQUESTED THE AGENCY

01:23:20.362 --> 01:23:21.730
THAT THE CURRENT PUMPED

MEET ANTICIPATED RELIABILITY

01:23:25.967 --> 01:23:27.168
AND RENEWABLE INTEGRATION

01:23:27.235 --> 01:23:29.471
CHALLENGES SINCE TWENTY

01:23:29.537 --> 01:23:31.873
EIGHTEEN CPUC MODELING HAS

01:23:31.940 --> 01:23:34.142
CONSISTENTLY SHOWN THE NEW FOR

ENERGY STORAGE BY TWENTY THIRD

01:23:46.254 --> 01:23:47.422
WELL WE'RE ALREADY NOT GOING TO

01:23:47.489 --> 01:23:49.124
MAKE THAT DEADLINE BECAUSE WE

01:23:49.190 --> 01:23:51.926
HAVEN'T STARTED IN MARCH TWENTY

01:23:51.993 --> 01:23:54.329

SIX IT'S OVER A DECADE TO DO

01:24:02.637 --> 01:24:06.708
THIS GOTTA START VERY SOON

01:24:06.775 --> 01:24:08.143
ONE DIRECTION STORAGE IS

01:24:08.209 --> 01:24:09.878
REQUIRED AS NATURAL GAS IS

RELIABILITY CONCERNS THE POINT

01:25:07.836 --> 01:25:11.105
IS WE'RE NOT EVEN PLANNING TO

01:25:11.172 --> 01:25:13.274
DO WHAT WE NEED TO DO WE'RE

01:25:13.341 --> 01:25:14.576
GOING TO NEED TO DEVELOP THAT

01:25:14.642 --> 01:25:17.345
LONG TERM STORAGE AND DEPLOY IT

01:25:17.412 --> 01:25:19.047
AND WE'RE GONNA TAKE A DECADE

01:25:19.113 --> 01:25:20.482
OR MORE TO DO MORE PUMPED

01:25:20.548 --> 01:25:26.888
HYDRO THIS HAS TO START NOW

01:25:26.955 --> 01:25:28.089
PRESIDENT BASHER MAYBE YOU

01:25:28.156 --> 01:25:31.593
MIGHT WANT TO -- IT WAS A

01:25:31.659 --> 01:25:33.361
STATEMENT BUT THERE'S QUESTIONS

01:25:33.428 --> 01:25:34.462
AND BETTER THAN THE STATEMENT

01:25:34.529 --> 01:25:35.463
THAT I THINK ARE IMPORTANT

01:25:35.530 --> 01:25:37.599
TO TO PROBABLY GET SOME OF

01:25:37.665 --> 01:25:39.467
YOUR THOUGHTS ON -- IN YOUR

01:25:39.534 --> 01:25:40.802
PRESENTATION YOU TALKED ABOUT

01:25:40.869 --> 01:25:43.638
ACCELERATING PROJECTS -- I

01:25:43.705 --> 01:25:45.940
KNOW THE LONG -- DURATION

01:25:46.007 --> 01:25:48.209
STORAGE IS PART OF THE CPU IT

01:25:48.276 --> 01:25:51.813
CQC'S MIX OF PROJECTS WOULD

01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:53.181
YOU LIKE TO TALK ABOUT HOW

01:25:53.248 --> 01:25:54.549
ALL OF THIS COMES TOGETHER

01:25:54.616 --> 01:25:56.351
AND WHAT THE ACCELERATION

01:25:56.417 --> 01:25:58.152
I I WILL DEFINITELY -- TAKE

01:25:58.219 --> 01:26:00.588
A SWING AT IT AND I ALSO

01:26:00.655 --> 01:26:03.758
HAVE AN EXPERT WITH ME PETE

01:26:03.825 --> 01:26:05.026
SCHOLARS THE DIRECTOR OF

PROCUREMENT AT THE P.

01:26:07.962 --> 01:26:10.798
YOU SEE SO -- I DID MENTION

01:26:10.865 --> 01:26:12.567
MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBER THAT

01:26:12.634 --> 01:26:16.237
WE ARE ON WE HAVE UNDERWAY NOW

01:26:16.304 --> 01:26:18.940
AN EXPEDITED RULEMAKING AND

01:26:19.007 --> 01:26:20.542
TO ADDRESS THE RELIABILITY FOR

SUMMER TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND

01:26:21.976 --> 01:26:23.177
THAT IS UNDER WAY AND IT WILL

01:26:23.244 --> 01:26:25.213
MAKE MANY OTHER CONSIDERATIONS

01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:27.782
THAT HAVE BEEN TALKED ABOUT ON

01:26:27.849 --> 01:26:31.386
IN TERMS OF -- -- PUMP STORAGE

01:26:31.452 --> 01:26:33.555
AND GEOTHERMAL GEOTHERMAL THOSE

01:26:33.621 --> 01:26:35.089
RESOURCES ABSOLUTELY SHOULD

01:26:35.156 --> 01:26:36.758
BE CONSIDERED WHEN DETERMINING

01:26:36.824 --> 01:26:38.192
THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE MANNER

01:26:38.259 --> 01:26:39.928
OF ACHIEVING OUR GREENHOUSE

01:26:39.994 --> 01:26:41.996
GAS GOALS AND ALSO ENSURING

01:26:42.063 --> 01:26:44.299
RELIABILITY AND THEY'RE ALREADY

01:26:44.365 --> 01:26:45.667
INCLUDED IN THE INTEGRATED

01:26:45.733 --> 01:26:47.402
PLANNING RESOURCE MODELS AND

01:26:47.468 --> 01:26:48.770
WILL CONTINUE TO BE PART OF

01:26:48.836 --> 01:26:49.904
THE MIX OF THE RESOURCE IS

01:26:49.971 --> 01:26:52.674
CONSIDERED IN THOSE MODELS --

01:26:52.740 --> 01:26:54.409
THE CURRENT OPTIMAL PORTFOLIO

01:26:54.475 --> 01:26:55.843
IDENTIFY SOME OF THE ADDITIONAL

01:26:55.910 --> 01:26:58.079
LONG DURATION STORAGE OR PUMP

01:26:58.146 --> 01:27:01.916
STORAGE -- WROTE RESOURCES

01:27:01.983 --> 01:27:05.486
REQUIRED -- AS WELL SO HE

01:27:05.553 --> 01:27:07.155
IS THERE'S ANYTHING THAT YOU

01:27:07.221 --> 01:27:09.357
WOULD LIKE TO ADD ON HE IS

01:27:09.424 --> 01:27:11.759
UP IN THE GALLERY THAT -- I

01:27:11.826 --> 01:27:13.761
PERHAPS WAS SHORT HANDED OUT

01:27:13.828 --> 01:27:18.566
WITH THANK YOU FOR THE BETTER

01:27:18.633 --> 01:27:26.741
-- YOU'LL HAVE TO SPEAK UP BE

01:27:26.808 --> 01:27:30.678
YEAH I THINK IT'S CORRECT THAT

01:27:30.745 --> 01:27:32.447
-- LONGER IF THIS WAS JUST

01:27:32.513 --> 01:27:34.282
A SECOND I'VE HAD I'VE HEARD

01:27:34.349 --> 01:27:35.850
SOUND LOUDER SO I'M NOT SURE

01:27:35.917 --> 01:27:37.986
IF IT'S CHALLENGES ALL YOU

01:27:38.052 --> 01:27:43.257
MAKE SURE SO IT IS THIS BETTER

01:27:43.324 --> 01:27:44.926
WE CAN HEAR YOU FINE HERE

01:27:44.993 --> 01:27:46.027
I'M JUST CONCERNED ABOUT

01:27:46.094 --> 01:27:49.397
THOSE WHO ARE WATCHING

01:27:49.464 --> 01:27:49.764
I DON'T KNOW IF

01:27:49.831 --> 01:27:53.134
THERE'S A WAY TO

01:27:53.201 --> 01:27:57.839
THAT IS GOING TO GET

01:27:57.905 --> 01:27:59.374
JUST BECAUSE LOUDEST PROSPECT

01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:02.810
OKAY -- SO IT IS -- AFTER A

01:28:02.877 --> 01:28:04.545
GOOD LONG DURATION STORAGE

01:28:04.612 --> 01:28:06.014
HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED IN THE

01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:07.115
INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANNING

01:28:07.181 --> 01:28:09.083
PROCESS IN THIS LAST CYCLE

01:28:09.150 --> 01:28:12.086
AND -- THERE YOU KNOW WORK

01:28:12.153 --> 01:28:13.888
IS UNDERWAY TO DETERMINE HOW

01:28:13.955 --> 01:28:15.890
MUCH AND WHAT FORMS WITH WITH

01:28:15.957 --> 01:28:18.626
BEST A FIT INTO THE PORTFOLIOS

01:28:18.693 --> 01:28:20.028
THERE IS A SIMPLE QUESTION THAT

01:28:20.094 --> 01:28:21.396
WE'RE WRESTLING WITH WHICH IS

01:28:21.462 --> 01:28:23.398
WHO IS GOING TO PROCURE IT --

01:28:23.464 --> 01:28:26.768
AS A RESULT OF THE -- CUSTOMER

01:28:26.834 --> 01:28:29.237
CHOICE INITIATIVES IN THE STATE

01:28:29.303 --> 01:28:31.606
THE OF INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES

01:28:31.673 --> 01:28:33.975
ARE SERVING LESS AND LESS OF

01:28:34.042 --> 01:28:36.244
THEIR LOAN YEAH THESE TEND TO

01:28:36.310 --> 01:28:38.880
BE A LONG PLANNING HIGH COST

01:28:38.946 --> 01:28:43.084
PROJECTS AND ARE -- DECEMBER

01:28:43.151 --> 01:28:45.687
DECISION THAT REQUIRED THE NEW

01:28:45.753 --> 01:28:47.622
TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED MEGAWATTS

01:28:47.689 --> 01:28:49.757
OF RESOURCES TO COME ONLINE

01:28:49.824 --> 01:28:51.125
FOR LIABILITY PURPOSES IS THE

01:28:51.192 --> 01:28:52.393
FIRST TIME THAT THE COMMISSION

01:28:52.460 --> 01:28:54.929
HAS DIRECTED ENTITIES

01:28:54.996 --> 01:28:55.630
OTHER THAN THE I.

01:28:55.697 --> 01:28:56.931
O. USED TO ACTUALLY GO OUT

01:28:56.998 --> 01:28:58.933
OF THE CURE AND SO THAT IS

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.869
OUR OUR FIRST -- DIRECTIVE

01:29:01.936 --> 01:29:04.272
IN THAT REGARD AND CLEARLY

01:29:04.338 --> 01:29:05.406
TO GET THIS LONG DURATION

01:29:05.473 --> 01:29:07.608
STORAGE THE COMMISSION NEEDS TO

01:29:07.675 --> 01:29:09.577
DETERMINE EXACTLY HOW IT WILL

01:29:09.644 --> 01:29:11.512
BE DIRECTING AND WHO WILL BE

01:29:11.579 --> 01:29:14.816
DIRECTING TO -- INVEST IN THOSE

01:29:14.882 --> 01:29:17.752
LONGER LOOK THOSE HIGH COST --

01:29:17.819 --> 01:29:20.621
LONG LEAD TIME PROJECTS MISTER

01:29:20.688 --> 01:29:22.457
CHAIR I BELIEVE THAT CHAIR

01:29:22.523 --> 01:29:23.858
HOPE SHE'LL WOULD ALSO LIKE

01:29:23.925 --> 01:29:26.561
TO ADD TO THE -- THE RESPONSE

01:29:26.627 --> 01:29:28.229
YEAH JUST TO ADD TO THAT --

01:29:28.296 --> 01:29:30.398
SO WE FIND ABOUT A HUNDRED

01:29:30.465 --> 01:29:31.599
FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR

01:29:31.666 --> 01:29:32.800
OF CLEAN ENERGY RESEARCH AND

01:29:32.867 --> 01:29:35.036
DEVELOPMENT INCLUDING A STORAGE

01:29:35.103 --> 01:29:36.971
PORTFOLIO REFUNDED ABOUT FORTY

01:29:37.038 --> 01:29:38.706
ENERGY STORAGE DEMONSTRATION

01:29:38.773 --> 01:29:40.875
PROJECTS ACROSS THE STATE AND

01:29:40.942 --> 01:29:41.909
NUMBER ACTUALLY ON MILITARY

01:29:41.976 --> 01:29:44.178
BASES AND CAMPUSES WITH ALL

01:29:44.245 --> 01:29:45.246
DIFFERENT CHEMISTRIES YOU KNOW

01:29:45.313 --> 01:29:47.148
VANADIUM IRON CHROMIUM AS WELL

01:29:47.215 --> 01:29:48.616
AS LITHIUM ION LITHIUM ION HAS

01:29:48.683 --> 01:29:50.818
BEEN TO THE WORK FORCE AND THE

01:29:50.885 --> 01:29:52.253
GOOD NEWS THERE IS THAT THE

01:29:52.320 --> 01:29:53.988
COST OF LIVING MINUS COME DOWN

01:29:54.055 --> 01:29:55.556
ABOUT NINETY PERCENT IN THE

01:29:55.623 --> 01:29:56.824
LAST TEN YEARS AND THERE IS A

01:29:56.891 --> 01:29:58.960
PATHWAY FOR PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL

01:29:59.026 --> 01:30:01.129
CONTINUED REDUCTIONS IN IN COST

01:30:01.195 --> 01:30:03.631
THERE BUT THERE IS ALSO SOME

01:30:03.698 --> 01:30:05.099
VERY PROMISING DEVELOPMENTS FOR

01:30:05.166 --> 01:30:06.200
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SOME

01:30:06.267 --> 01:30:07.835
OF IN COURT AROUND SEASONAL

01:30:07.902 --> 01:30:09.504
STORAGE -- ONE OF WHICH WE

01:30:09.570 --> 01:30:11.773
JUST FUNDED LAST YEAR AND SO

01:30:11.839 --> 01:30:13.040
-- THAT IS A SECTOR THAT'S

01:30:13.107 --> 01:30:14.909
EMERGING AND I WOULD JUST SAY

01:30:14.976 --> 01:30:17.879
THOUGH IT'S A MISTAKE TO VIEW

01:30:17.945 --> 01:30:19.680
STORAGE IS THE SILVER BULLET

01:30:19.747 --> 01:30:21.415
IT'S REALLY A SILVER BUCKSHOT

01:30:21.482 --> 01:30:22.917
SOLUTION STORAGE IS ONE OF THE

01:30:22.984 --> 01:30:25.753
PIECES THE OTHERS ARE DIVERSITY

01:30:25.820 --> 01:30:27.822
OF CLEAN ENERGY RESOURCES AND

01:30:27.889 --> 01:30:29.457
THAT INCLUDES YOUR GEOTHERMAL

01:30:29.524 --> 01:30:30.658
EVEN EVENTUALLY DOING WHAT

01:30:30.725 --> 01:30:32.026
THEY'VE DONE THESE COST OF

01:30:32.093 --> 01:30:34.328
OFFSHORE WIND MUCH IMPROVEMENT

01:30:34.395 --> 01:30:35.863
WE CAN MAKE AROUND -- DEMAND

01:30:35.930 --> 01:30:37.799
RESPONSE AND YOU KNOW WE HAVE

01:30:37.865 --> 01:30:39.367
SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND

01:30:39.433 --> 01:30:40.468
ELECTRIC VEHICLES HAVE BEEN

01:30:40.535 --> 01:30:42.703
BOUGHT IN CALIFORNIA AND DOING

01:30:42.770 --> 01:30:44.372
INTELLIGENT CHARGING PROTOCOLS

01:30:44.438 --> 01:30:45.606
-- AND AND A NUMBER OF OTHER

01:30:45.673 --> 01:30:48.009
STEPS SO THERE ISN'T ONE SILVER

01:30:48.075 --> 01:30:49.243
BULLET HERE IT'S MANY STEPS BUT

01:30:49.310 --> 01:30:56.017
STORAGE IS AN IMPORTANT PIECE

01:30:56.083 --> 01:30:58.886
THEREFORE ONE OF THE DOCTORS

01:30:58.953 --> 01:31:01.789
ALL BELIEVE THE CURRENT

01:31:01.856 --> 01:31:06.227
HYDROPOWER -- STORAGE WHEN

01:31:06.294 --> 01:31:07.461
I SEE THE R. F. P.

01:31:07.528 --> 01:31:10.131
GOING NOW TOTAL THAT IT'S JUST

01:31:10.198 --> 01:31:14.135
FOR AND FOR LONG TERM STORAGE

01:31:14.202 --> 01:31:16.270
FOR SEASONAL STORAGE YOU CAN'T

01:31:16.337 --> 01:31:17.605
DEAL WITH BATTERIES THERE ISN'T

01:31:17.672 --> 01:31:19.307
ENOUGH LITHIUM AND COBALT TO

01:31:19.373 --> 01:31:20.808
DO IT BY ABOUT A FACTOR OF A

01:31:20.875 --> 01:31:23.244
HUNDRED SO YOU JUST CAN'T DO

01:31:23.311 --> 01:31:25.079
IT WITH BATTERIES WE'VE GOT

01:31:25.146 --> 01:31:26.914
TO DESIGN SOMETHING FOR YOU

01:31:26.981 --> 01:31:28.549
CAN STORE ENERGY FOR WEEKS AT

01:31:28.616 --> 01:31:31.219
A TIME THE VARIETY OF THINGS

01:31:31.285 --> 01:31:33.054
THAT HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED I

01:31:33.120 --> 01:31:34.922
WANT TO SEE YOUR PLANS FOR

01:31:34.989 --> 01:31:36.657
DOING IT AND I WANNA SEE

01:31:36.724 --> 01:31:40.027
YOU START DEVELOPING IT NOW

01:31:40.094 --> 01:31:41.963
I THINK I HEARD THE -- THE

01:31:42.029 --> 01:31:44.699
WITNESSES DESCRIBE IT AS OF

01:31:44.765 --> 01:31:47.034
NOT ONE SINGLE SILVER BULLET

01:31:47.101 --> 01:31:48.236
BUT THERE ARE A VARIETY OF

01:31:48.302 --> 01:31:51.038
OPTIONS AND THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE

01:31:51.105 --> 01:31:52.506
DESCRIBING I DON'T INDIVIDUAL

01:31:52.573 --> 01:31:56.844
DOCTOR -- CORPORATE AND YEAH

01:31:56.911 --> 01:31:58.779
I WOULD BECAUSE I'M JUST GONNA

01:31:58.846 --> 01:32:00.581
MAKE A VERY QUICK STATEMENT

01:32:00.648 --> 01:32:01.816
AND THEN TRANSITION TO DOCTOR

01:32:01.883 --> 01:32:04.685
EGGMAN BUT WHAT I HEARD WAS

01:32:04.752 --> 01:32:06.053
THAT THERE ARE A VARIETY OF

01:32:06.120 --> 01:32:07.421
WAYS TO KIND OF GET TO WHERE

01:32:07.488 --> 01:32:10.224
WE NEED TO BE A LONG DURATION

01:32:10.291 --> 01:32:11.492
PUMP STORAGE COULD PROBABLY

01:32:11.559 --> 01:32:15.296
PART OF THAT SOLUTION DR

01:32:15.363 --> 01:32:16.898
THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR

01:32:16.964 --> 01:32:18.733
THE PRESENTATION TODAY -- AND

01:32:18.799 --> 01:32:19.967
I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS A

01:32:20.034 --> 01:32:22.069
A A DIFFICULT TOPIC IN A IN

01:32:22.136 --> 01:32:23.905
A IN A MASSIVE PUZZLE THAT

01:32:23.971 --> 01:32:25.539
WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

01:32:25.606 --> 01:32:26.674
IN THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE

01:32:26.741 --> 01:32:28.876
AND CLEANEST WAY POSSIBLE I

01:32:28.943 --> 01:32:29.911
WILL ALSO SAY SOMEBODY WHO

01:32:29.977 --> 01:32:31.512
REPRESENTS SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY

01:32:31.579 --> 01:32:33.447
IN THE DELTA AREA AND THE HEAT

01:32:33.514 --> 01:32:35.716
THAT WE EXPERIENCE -- IN THE

01:32:35.783 --> 01:32:37.051
MIDST OF A PANDEMIC IN THE

01:32:37.118 --> 01:32:38.619
MIDST OF WILDFIRES TO HAVE TO

01:32:38.686 --> 01:32:39.720
THINK ABOUT TURNING OFF YOUR

01:32:39.787 --> 01:32:42.423
POWER CREATED ANXIETY LIKE

01:32:42.490 --> 01:32:44.258
I HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED IN MY

01:32:44.325 --> 01:32:46.794
COMMUNITY FOUR IN IN MY IN MY

01:32:46.861 --> 01:32:48.796
LIFETIME ASSEMBLY WHO CHAIRS

01:32:48.863 --> 01:32:50.831
THE AGRICULTURE COMMISSION TO

01:32:50.898 --> 01:32:53.100
THE COMMITTEE ON THE COST OF

01:32:53.167 --> 01:32:55.136
A POWER THE COST OF OF WHAT

01:32:55.202 --> 01:32:57.305
IT TAKES TO SHUT DOWN IS --

01:32:57.371 --> 01:32:58.706
IT WILL TAKE IT WILL TAKE A

01:32:58.773 --> 01:33:01.375
LONG TIME TO RECOVER FROM SO

01:33:01.442 --> 01:33:02.977
I WENT ONLINE SO MY COMMENTS

01:33:03.044 --> 01:33:05.279
WITH THE -- MY COLLEAGUE MISTER

01:33:05.346 --> 01:33:07.348
CORK -- THAT WE NEED LONG TERM

01:33:07.415 --> 01:33:09.583
STORAGE I HAD A I HAD A -- A

01:33:09.650 --> 01:33:10.718
BILL LAST YEAR THAT I THINK

01:33:10.785 --> 01:33:12.386
WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO REVISIT

01:33:12.453 --> 01:33:13.521
THAT AND WE NEED TO DO IT WE

01:33:13.587 --> 01:33:14.755
CAN'T JUST KEEP TALKING ABOUT

01:33:14.822 --> 01:33:16.924
IT IT'S GOT TO BE PLANNED IT'S

01:33:16.991 --> 01:33:18.392
GOT TO BE WE NEED TO HAVE A

01:33:18.459 --> 01:33:20.594
GOAL OUT THERE AND THIRTY WHEN

01:33:20.661 --> 01:33:21.629
I HEAR YOU TALKING ABOUT WE'RE

01:33:21.696 --> 01:33:23.397
GONNA MAKE IT NEXT YEAR I THINK

01:33:23.464 --> 01:33:25.533
ABOUT AS I AM APPROACHING AGE

01:33:25.599 --> 01:33:27.134
OF RETIREMENT RIGHT SO WE'RE

01:33:27.201 --> 01:33:29.270
TALKING ABOUT RETIREMENT BUT

01:33:29.337 --> 01:33:30.204
WE'RE JUST PLANNING YEAR BY

01:33:30.271 --> 01:33:31.639
YEAR WE'VE GOT TO DO BETTER

01:33:31.706 --> 01:33:33.107
TO GET THERE IF WE JUST ARE

01:33:33.174 --> 01:33:34.842
PLANNING ON FOR NEXT YEAR WE

01:33:34.909 --> 01:33:35.843
CAN'T GET THERE SO I THINK

01:33:35.910 --> 01:33:37.111
THE LONG TERM PLANS NEED TO

01:33:37.178 --> 01:33:38.913
BE IMPLEMENTED PLANNED AND

01:33:38.980 --> 01:33:40.147
IMPLEMENTED AND SEE THE R.

01:33:40.214 --> 01:33:42.650
PEAS GO OUT ON THE ISSUE OF MY

01:33:42.717 --> 01:33:45.386
MORAL OR IMMORAL -- ELECTRONS

01:33:45.453 --> 01:33:46.387
I FOUND THAT FASCINATING OF

01:33:46.454 --> 01:33:48.622
THE AS AS AS A GOOD CATHOLIC I

01:33:48.689 --> 01:33:50.057
ALSO BELIEVE IN IN FORGIVENESS

01:33:50.124 --> 01:33:51.625
AND AND DEGREES OF OF WHAT WE

01:33:51.692 --> 01:33:53.894
CAN DO -- SO I'D ALSO LIKE TO

01:33:53.961 --> 01:33:55.696
SEE IS EXPAND OFFSHORE WIND

01:33:55.763 --> 01:33:57.264
I LIKE TO SEE US DO MORE WITH

01:33:57.331 --> 01:33:59.033
WITH BIOMASS AND I NEED YOU

01:33:59.100 --> 01:34:00.134
TO TELL US WHAT WE NEED TO

01:34:00.201 --> 01:34:01.469
DO TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THOSE

01:34:01.535 --> 01:34:03.237
THINGS HAPPEN SO WE CAN HAVE

01:34:03.304 --> 01:34:04.972
A CONSISTENT BASELOAD BOTH

01:34:05.039 --> 01:34:06.907
IN THE FOREST FIRES AND I WE

01:34:06.974 --> 01:34:08.275
LOST A PLACE WITH A LITTLE

01:34:08.342 --> 01:34:09.810
OFF THE GRID AND HAD TO RELY

01:34:09.877 --> 01:34:11.979
ON THE SOLAR NEVER WORKED I

01:34:12.046 --> 01:34:13.948
COULD NEVER GET MY MY PROPANE

01:34:14.015 --> 01:34:16.050
REFRIGERATOR MY SOLAR POWER

01:34:16.117 --> 01:34:17.985
ALL TO WORK AT THE SAME TIME

01:34:18.052 --> 01:34:19.053
BUT NOW WOULD BURN TO THE

01:34:19.120 --> 01:34:20.721
GROUND SO IT'S A REALLY A NEW

01:34:20.788 --> 01:34:22.490
ISSUE -- BUT I CAN TELL YOU

01:34:22.556 --> 01:34:24.158
GOING UP THERE AND THE IMPACT

01:34:24.225 --> 01:34:25.926
THAT I STILL HAVE A MY LOANS

01:34:25.993 --> 01:34:27.261
FROM THE SMOKE THAT CAME DOWN

01:34:27.328 --> 01:34:29.163
HUNDREDS OF MILES AWAY TO SIT

01:34:29.230 --> 01:34:31.232
IN THE VALLEY IS UNACCEPTABLE

01:34:31.298 --> 01:34:33.334
RIGHT AND THE AMOUNT OF OF

01:34:33.401 --> 01:34:34.568
OF THE REASON WE NEED TO TAKE

01:34:34.635 --> 01:34:36.170
OUT OF OUR FORCED THE AMOUNT

01:34:36.237 --> 01:34:37.872
OF WASTE THAT IS GENERATED BY

01:34:37.938 --> 01:34:39.640
OUR AG THAT WE NEED THEY NEED

01:34:39.707 --> 01:34:41.008
TO BE TO PRUNE WE NEED TO TAKE

01:34:41.075 --> 01:34:42.109
CARE OF THINGS AND WE NEED TO

01:34:42.176 --> 01:34:44.412
DO SOMETHING WITH ALL OF THAT

01:34:44.478 --> 01:34:45.679
AND THE CLEANER ENERGY WE CAN

01:34:45.746 --> 01:34:48.516
MAKE SOME OF THAT AGAIN MANAGE

01:34:48.582 --> 01:34:50.317
OUR BASE I THINK IT'S JUST A

01:34:50.384 --> 01:34:51.752
SMARTER WAY TO GO WE'RE NEVER

01:34:51.819 --> 01:34:52.720
GOING TO BE ABLE TO TURN OUR

01:34:52.787 --> 01:34:54.055
BACK ON OUR FLOORS AND OUR

01:34:54.121 --> 01:34:55.790
HAGMAN'S NEED TO BE ABLE TO

01:34:55.856 --> 01:34:57.291
USE THEM IN A COLLABORATIVE

01:34:57.358 --> 01:34:59.627
WAY TO INCREASE OUR ABILITY TO

01:34:59.693 --> 01:35:01.929
MAINTAIN CAPACITY IS INCREDIBLY

01:35:01.996 --> 01:35:02.930
FRUSTRATING FOR THOSE OF US

01:35:02.997 --> 01:35:04.165
WHO LIVE IN THE VALLEY WHO

01:35:04.231 --> 01:35:05.800
HAVE EXTREME HEAT AND EXTREME

01:35:05.866 --> 01:35:07.535
POVERTY THEY HAVE TO EXPLAIN

01:35:07.601 --> 01:35:09.103
TO PEOPLE WHY THEY HAVE TO TURN

01:35:09.170 --> 01:35:12.373
THEIR POWER AND SO I WILL BUY

01:35:12.440 --> 01:35:13.707
ABOVE EXPRESSED SOME OF THE

01:35:13.774 --> 01:35:15.276
URGENCY THAT WE ALL FEEL TO

01:35:15.342 --> 01:35:17.078
ADDRESS THIS THE QUESTIONS THAT

01:35:17.144 --> 01:35:19.713
WE GET MORE AT HOME ABOUT THIS

01:35:19.780 --> 01:35:22.283
ISSUE AND AND REALLY LOOK AT

01:35:22.349 --> 01:35:23.818
EVERY SYSTEM ON THE TABLE TO

01:35:23.884 --> 01:35:25.920
BE ABLE TO MANAGE IT IN A LONG

01:35:25.986 --> 01:35:28.389
TERM FOR A LONG TERM GOAL BUT

01:35:28.456 --> 01:35:30.157
IN SHORT TERM STEPS THAT WE CAN

01:35:30.224 --> 01:35:31.959
ALL SEE AND CHECK OFF A YEAR

01:35:32.026 --> 01:35:33.828
BY YEAR ARE WE NEEDING THOSE

01:35:33.894 --> 01:35:35.896
TO BE ABLE TO GET THE ULTIMATE

01:35:35.963 --> 01:35:37.031
TO BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN A CLEAN

01:35:37.098 --> 01:35:43.137
ENVIRONMENT AND KEEP LOTS OF

01:35:43.204 --> 01:35:47.308
MR KING MISS RAYOS GARCIA

01:35:47.374 --> 01:35:49.710
MISTER

01:35:49.777 --> 01:35:51.112
THANK YOU MR LOTS OF THANK

01:35:51.178 --> 01:35:53.481
YOU TO ALL THE LEADERS OF THE

01:35:53.547 --> 01:35:55.883
ADMINISTRATION FOR AND REALLY

01:35:55.950 --> 01:35:58.385
BEING HERE TODAY -- HAVEN'T

01:35:58.452 --> 01:35:59.353
HAVE A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS

01:35:59.420 --> 01:36:01.455
JUST LIKE MY COLLEAGUES --

01:36:01.522 --> 01:36:03.624
ONE PARTICULAR AREA OBVIOUSLY

01:36:03.691 --> 01:36:06.760
IS TO SURE THAT WE ARE DOING

01:36:06.827 --> 01:36:10.264
-- PROPER PROCUREMENT AND --

01:36:10.331 --> 01:36:11.899
DOING THE PROPER REGULATION

01:36:11.966 --> 01:36:14.668
REGARDING OUR ENERGY PROCESS

01:36:14.735 --> 01:36:16.871
AND IN PARTICULAR TO ENSURE

01:36:16.937 --> 01:36:20.608
THAT WE ARE EXPEDITING THE

01:36:20.674 --> 01:36:22.143
PROCUREMENT BUT ALSO THE

01:36:22.209 --> 01:36:23.978
DEVELOPMENT OF RENEWABLE ENERGY

01:36:24.044 --> 01:36:27.148
AS WELL AS BATTERY STORAGE --

01:36:27.214 --> 01:36:29.683
OBVIOUSLY YOUR AGENCIES ARE NOT

01:36:29.750 --> 01:36:33.187
THOUGHT OF AS NIMBLE WE KNOW

01:36:33.254 --> 01:36:35.055
THAT WE NEED THIS ENERGY WE

01:36:35.122 --> 01:36:36.524
NEEDED THIS ENERGY YESTERDAY

01:36:36.590 --> 01:36:39.360
AND QUITE OFTEN FRANKLY AT THE

01:36:39.426 --> 01:36:42.730
SAME THAT WE HAVE A -- -- A

01:36:42.796 --> 01:36:44.365
PROCESS FOR A MANAGER TO SOME

01:36:44.431 --> 01:36:45.733
OF THE MISNOMER WE WE HAVE

01:36:45.799 --> 01:36:48.302
A NINETEENTH CENTURY ENERGY

01:36:48.369 --> 01:36:49.703
SYSTEM WHERE YOU GENERATE

01:36:49.770 --> 01:36:51.505
ENERGY AND YOU HAVE TO USE IT

01:36:51.572 --> 01:36:52.506
IMMEDIATELY WE DON'T REALLY

01:36:52.573 --> 01:36:55.075
MANAGER WE WE GENERATED AND

01:36:55.142 --> 01:36:56.944
WE USE IT AND WE HOPE TO YOU

01:36:57.011 --> 01:36:57.945
KNOW WE NEED IT WE HOPE TO BE

01:36:58.012 --> 01:36:59.480
ABLE TO BUY IT FROM SOMEWHERE

01:36:59.547 --> 01:37:00.848
THAT'S BEING GENERATED SO IF

01:37:00.915 --> 01:37:03.050
YOU COULD REALLY SPEAK TO HOW

01:37:03.117 --> 01:37:05.920
YOUR AGENCIES ARE UPDATING

01:37:05.986 --> 01:37:08.222
YOUR SPECIFIC PROCESSES SO

01:37:08.289 --> 01:37:09.857
THAT IT DOESN'T TAKE YEARS AND

01:37:09.924 --> 01:37:14.595
YEARS TO -- PURCHASE DEVELOP

01:37:14.662 --> 01:37:16.130
NEW ENERGY AND I WOULD LIKE IN

01:37:16.197 --> 01:37:19.200
PARTICULAR TO HAVE HIGH SO --

01:37:19.266 --> 01:37:23.337
TALK ABOUT HOW YOU ARE BETTER

01:37:23.404 --> 01:37:24.939
MANAGING THE ENERGY BECAUSE I

01:37:25.005 --> 01:37:26.941
THINK THIS WORD MANAGING OF THE

01:37:27.007 --> 01:37:29.076
ENERGY SYSTEM IS SORT OF A MY

01:37:29.143 --> 01:37:32.513
PASSWORD BUT A MISNOMER I CAN

01:37:32.580 --> 01:37:35.516
SPEAK A BIT TO THE PLANNING --

01:37:35.583 --> 01:37:38.852
MR TANG -- WE WE DO HAVE LONGER

01:37:38.919 --> 01:37:40.688
TERM PLANNING WE PLAN THE YEAR

01:37:40.754 --> 01:37:42.289
AHEAD THREE YEARS AND FIVE

01:37:42.356 --> 01:37:45.025
YEARS -- ARE ARE PLANNING CYCLE

01:37:45.092 --> 01:37:47.528
ALONG WITH THE FORECASTING

01:37:47.595 --> 01:37:49.663
AND OTHER INFORMATION THAT WE

01:37:49.730 --> 01:37:51.498
ALL SHARE TOGETHER AND I WILL

01:37:51.565 --> 01:37:53.867
LET CHAIRMAN HOPE SHE'LL SPEAK

01:37:53.934 --> 01:37:57.538
TO THE FORECASTING -- AS WELL

01:37:57.605 --> 01:38:00.674
AND AS I MENTIONED WE DO HAVE

01:38:00.741 --> 01:38:02.977
UNDERWENT EXPEDITED -- I OUR

01:38:03.043 --> 01:38:04.778
RULEMAKING PROCEEDING THAT

01:38:04.845 --> 01:38:06.013
WILL INDEED LOOK AT SOME OF

01:38:06.080 --> 01:38:08.482
THE RESOURCES FOR THIS COMING

01:38:08.549 --> 01:38:10.384
YEAR SO THERE'S A SHORT TERM

01:38:10.451 --> 01:38:13.087
AND AND A LONG TERM EFFORT IT'S

01:38:13.153 --> 01:38:15.656
ALWAYS UNDER WAY AT THE PC I

01:38:15.723 --> 01:38:17.825
WILL SAY THAT SINCE I'VE BEEN

01:38:17.891 --> 01:38:19.627
AT THE PC MISTER CHANG THIS

01:38:19.693 --> 01:38:26.233
LAST YEAR -- I HAVE BEEN --

01:38:26.300 --> 01:38:28.869
I HAVE BEEN AMAZED AT HOW

01:38:28.936 --> 01:38:32.039
QUICKLY AND MORE NIMBLE NOTHING

01:38:32.106 --> 01:38:34.575
NICHOLAS BUT MORE NIMBLE THE

01:38:34.642 --> 01:38:37.244
AND PC HAS BECOME JUST AS

01:38:37.311 --> 01:38:40.381
AN EXAMPLE WE WERE ABLE TO

01:38:40.447 --> 01:38:42.950
START INCOMPLETE THE PGA ANY

01:38:43.017 --> 01:38:44.985
BANKRUPTCY RULE MAKING IN EIGHT

01:38:45.052 --> 01:38:47.288
MONTHS AT THE SAME TIME THAT WE

01:38:47.354 --> 01:38:49.423
WERE DOING OUR A AND I. R.

01:38:49.490 --> 01:38:51.659
P. WORK ALL THE WHILE WE WERE

01:38:51.725 --> 01:38:52.893
ALSO DOING THE T.

01:38:52.960 --> 01:38:56.530
MOBILE AND MERGER WE FINISHED

01:38:56.597 --> 01:38:58.832
AND DURING THAT SAME SIX MONTH

01:38:58.899 --> 01:39:00.734
OR EIGHT NINE MONTH PERIOD

01:39:00.801 --> 01:39:03.470
THE -- MICROGRID PHASE TWO

01:39:03.537 --> 01:39:06.040
RULEMAKING I STARTED THE TELCO

01:39:06.106 --> 01:39:08.542
-- PHASE ONE AND PHASE TWO

01:39:08.609 --> 01:39:09.977
PROCEEDINGS THAT GO TO THE

01:39:10.044 --> 01:39:11.612
TELCO EFFORTS UNDER P. S. P.

01:39:11.679 --> 01:39:14.214
S. SO IT IS TRUE WE HAVE SOME

01:39:14.281 --> 01:39:17.918
PRETTY ARCHAIC PROCESSES AT THE

01:39:17.985 --> 01:39:20.054
PC BUT WE'VE BEEN MOVING IN A

01:39:20.120 --> 01:39:22.389
MUCH MORE SWIFT I THINK LESS

01:39:22.456 --> 01:39:24.491
BUREAUCRATIC MANNER IT LEAST

01:39:24.558 --> 01:39:26.260
IN MY TWELVE MONTHS OF BEING ON

01:39:26.327 --> 01:39:29.029
THE ON THE COMMISSION -- DAVID

01:39:29.096 --> 01:39:31.598
WOULD YOU I CAN'T SEE WHO WANTS

01:39:31.665 --> 01:39:34.368
TO SPEAK OKAY STEVE I CAN'T

01:39:34.435 --> 01:39:36.804
SEE YOU I'M SORRY -- WELL I'LL

01:39:36.870 --> 01:39:38.439
GO AHEAD AND TRY TO RESPOND TO

01:39:38.505 --> 01:39:40.474
SOME OF THESE THINGS -- THANK

01:39:40.541 --> 01:39:43.644
YOU AND MISTER TANK -- YOU

01:39:43.711 --> 01:39:44.845
KNOW LET ME JUST BE A LITTLE

01:39:44.912 --> 01:39:46.180
BIT EXPENSIVE ANSWERING THIS

01:39:46.246 --> 01:39:48.515
WE WE DEFINITELY FIRST OF ALL

01:39:48.582 --> 01:39:50.217
I WANT EVERYBODY TO ESTABLISH

01:39:50.284 --> 01:39:52.753
THAT WE REGULARLY OPERATE THE

01:39:52.820 --> 01:39:55.055
GRID AT OVER FIFTY PERCENT OF

01:39:55.122 --> 01:39:58.492
THE LOAD SERVED BY -- BASICALLY

01:39:58.559 --> 01:40:00.894
SOLAR AND WIND REGULARLY WERE

01:40:00.961 --> 01:40:04.231
RECOGNIZED AROUND THE WORLD AS

01:40:04.298 --> 01:40:07.067
THAT AND WE'VE HAD ABOUT EIGHTY

01:40:07.134 --> 01:40:08.602
DIFFERENT COUNTRIES OVER THE

01:40:08.669 --> 01:40:10.738
LAST FEW YEARS COME TO THE I SO

01:40:10.804 --> 01:40:12.639
TO SEE HOW WE'RE DOING IT AND

01:40:12.706 --> 01:40:14.775
WHAT WE'RE DOING RECOGNIZED AS

01:40:14.842 --> 01:40:16.643
HAVING A MARKET THAT IS VERY

01:40:16.710 --> 01:40:17.878
FORWARD LEANING TO AND I CAN

01:40:17.945 --> 01:40:20.013
GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF THAT WE

01:40:20.080 --> 01:40:23.016
ALLOW AS AN EXAMPLE DISTRIBUTED

01:40:23.083 --> 01:40:25.686
ENERGY RESOURCES OR ANY

01:40:25.753 --> 01:40:28.055
DISTRIBUTED ASSET TO COME INTO

01:40:28.122 --> 01:40:31.825
OUR MARKETS AS AN AGGREGATION

01:40:31.892 --> 01:40:34.495
THAT CAPABILITY IS THERE WE'RE

01:40:34.561 --> 01:40:36.196
ALSO LEARNING HOW TO OPERATE

01:40:36.263 --> 01:40:39.533
THE GRID AS AN EXAMPLE A A VERY

01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:41.969
LARGE BATTERY OVER TWO HUNDRED

01:40:42.035 --> 01:40:43.604
MEGAWATTS CALLED THE GATEWAY

01:40:43.670 --> 01:40:46.006
BATTERY -- CAME ONLINE OVER THE

01:40:46.073 --> 01:40:49.042
LAST SEVERAL MONTHS AND HOW YOU

01:40:49.109 --> 01:40:51.645
CHARGE AND DISCHARGE AT BATTERY

01:40:51.712 --> 01:40:52.646
THE SOMETHING WE'RE LEARNING

01:40:52.713 --> 01:40:56.116
ABOUT AS AN EXAMPLE IF IT'S A

01:40:56.183 --> 01:40:58.152
TWO HUNDRED MEGAWATT BATTERY

01:40:58.218 --> 01:41:00.187
IT CAN CHARGE TWO HUNDRED

01:41:00.254 --> 01:41:02.423
MEGAWATTS IT CAN DISCHARGED TO

01:41:02.489 --> 01:41:04.091
AN AMERICAN WHAT'S IN IT CAN

01:41:04.158 --> 01:41:05.859
TURN ON A DIME WHICH IS A FOUR

01:41:05.926 --> 01:41:08.262
HUNDRED MEGAWATTS SWING WHEN

01:41:08.328 --> 01:41:09.897
YOU HAVE TEN THOUSAND MEGAWATTS

01:41:09.963 --> 01:41:11.031
OF STORAGE ON THE SYSTEM YOU

01:41:11.098 --> 01:41:12.132
HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT

01:41:12.199 --> 01:41:14.501
THAT SWING SO WE'RE LEARNING

01:41:14.568 --> 01:41:15.469
ON HOW TO INTEGRATE THOSE

01:41:15.536 --> 01:41:18.572
THINGS IN OUR MARKET SO WE ARE

01:41:18.639 --> 01:41:23.010
-- ADAPTING TO THIS NEW -- TO

01:41:23.076 --> 01:41:26.146
THIS NEW REALITY ALSO NOTE THAT

01:41:26.213 --> 01:41:28.015
WE'VE HAD A COUPLE OF TIMES

01:41:28.081 --> 01:41:30.284
WERE RESEARCH OVER SEVENTY

01:41:30.350 --> 01:41:32.519
PERCENT OF THE LOAD -- WITH

01:41:32.586 --> 01:41:34.455
RENEWABLES SO I THINK THE STATE

01:41:34.521 --> 01:41:36.356
IS MAKING VERY GOOD PROGRESS

01:41:36.423 --> 01:41:37.391
YOU KNOW I I MEAN I COULDN'T

01:41:37.458 --> 01:41:38.292
AGREE MORE I THINK WE HAVE A

01:41:38.358 --> 01:41:39.993
VERY AGGRESSIVE GOALS AND I

01:41:40.060 --> 01:41:43.330
THINK THAT THE FOUR OF YOU --

01:41:43.397 --> 01:41:45.732
YEAH SURE OUR SENSE OF URGENCY

01:41:45.799 --> 01:41:48.202
AND OUR DESIRE TO REALLY MOVE

01:41:48.268 --> 01:41:49.703
IN THIS DIRECTION I THINK MY

01:41:49.770 --> 01:41:52.439
CONCERN ISN'T ISN'T EVEN THAT

01:41:52.506 --> 01:41:53.707
THE LEADERSHIP FOR THE THREE OF

01:41:53.774 --> 01:41:56.477
YOU AS YOU MOVE FORWARD REALLY

01:41:56.543 --> 01:41:59.012
-- YOUR NEXT LEVEL DOWN AND

01:41:59.079 --> 01:42:01.181
WHETHER OR NOT YOU CAN REALLY

01:42:01.248 --> 01:42:03.717
MOVE YOUR INDIVIDUAL AGENCIES

01:42:03.784 --> 01:42:04.751
I MEAN JUST FOR EXAMPLE THE

01:42:04.818 --> 01:42:06.487
TYPE OF THE PRODUCT THAT I

01:42:06.553 --> 01:42:08.422
MEAN DEMAND RESPONSE WE HAVE

01:42:08.489 --> 01:42:10.190
SO MUCH TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION

01:42:10.257 --> 01:42:11.925
IN THE ENERGY AREA JUST IN THE

01:42:11.992 --> 01:42:13.327
STATE ALONE DEMAND RESPONSE

01:42:13.393 --> 01:42:17.197
IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THAT --

01:42:17.264 --> 01:42:18.732
BUT IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE WE

01:42:18.799 --> 01:42:24.838
ARE ADEQUATELY EMBRACING --

01:42:24.905 --> 01:42:27.441
THAT WE NEED I THINK THAT IS I

01:42:27.508 --> 01:42:30.143
THINK WHERE WE'RE FEELING THE

01:42:30.210 --> 01:42:32.946
CONCERN BECAUSE YOU YOU HEARD

01:42:33.013 --> 01:42:33.814
IT FROM THE GOVERNOR I KNOW

01:42:33.881 --> 01:42:34.648
YOU HEARD IT DIRECTLY FROM THE

01:42:34.715 --> 01:42:36.183
GOVERNOR YOU HEARD IT FROM US

01:42:36.250 --> 01:42:38.151
BUT WE WE HEARD IT WE REALLY

01:42:38.218 --> 01:42:39.353
HEARD FROM MY CONSTITUENTS

01:42:39.419 --> 01:42:44.258
AND -- THIS TYPE OF -- ENERGY

01:42:44.324 --> 01:42:45.726
SHORTFALL IS JUST SORT OF

01:42:45.792 --> 01:42:47.461
INEXCUSABLE ESPECIALLY GIVEN

01:42:47.528 --> 01:42:50.030
THAT WE ON A REGULAR BASIS OVER

01:42:50.097 --> 01:42:51.465
PROCURE ABOUT MY UNDERSTAND

01:42:51.532 --> 01:42:52.733
ABOUT FIFTEEN PERCENT OF THE

01:42:52.799 --> 01:42:54.701
ENERGY THAT WE NEED WHICH IS

01:42:54.768 --> 01:42:56.036
YOU KNOW WHICH INCREASES RATES

01:42:56.103 --> 01:42:58.939
WHICH INCREASES COSTS SO IT

01:42:59.006 --> 01:43:01.208
SEEMS ODD THAT AT THE TIME THAT

01:43:01.275 --> 01:43:02.543
EVEN THOUGH WE REGULARLY OVER

01:43:02.609 --> 01:43:04.945
FOR SURE ABOUT FIFTEEN PERCENT

01:43:05.012 --> 01:43:06.613
OF THE ENERGY THAT WE NEED

01:43:06.680 --> 01:43:09.116
THAT WE STILL WERE NOT ABLE TO

01:43:09.182 --> 01:43:11.184
MEET OUR ENERGY NEEDS ON THE

01:43:11.251 --> 01:43:12.586
FOURTEENTH AND FIFTEENTH OF

01:43:12.653 --> 01:43:14.955
AUGUST SUGGEST I THINK GOING

01:43:15.022 --> 01:43:17.891
BACK TO MY QUESTION WHY DIDN'T

01:43:17.958 --> 01:43:21.228
HEAR IS I HEARD SORT OF HIGH

01:43:21.295 --> 01:43:23.196
LEVEL HEY WE'RE WE'RE DOING

01:43:23.263 --> 01:43:25.165
BETTER BUT I'D LIKE TO KNOW

01:43:25.232 --> 01:43:27.801
SPECIFIC MORE MORE SPECIFICALLY

01:43:27.868 --> 01:43:31.004
WHAT YOUR AGENCIES ARE DOING

01:43:31.071 --> 01:43:36.310
TO SPEED UP THE ABILITY TO GET

01:43:36.376 --> 01:43:38.378
RENEWABLE ENERGY ONLINE AND

01:43:38.445 --> 01:43:40.681
ALSO TO MAKE IT MORE RELIABLE

01:43:40.747 --> 01:43:42.549
SO WE TALKED ABOUT I THINK SURE

01:43:42.616 --> 01:43:44.952
HOPE SHE'LL TALK ABOUT ENERGY

01:43:45.018 --> 01:43:46.119
STORAGE IS BEING OBVIOUSLY

01:43:46.186 --> 01:43:47.487
ONLY ONE OF MANY THINGS YOU

01:43:47.554 --> 01:43:49.523
HAVE BATTERY STORAGE YOU HAVE

01:43:49.590 --> 01:43:52.059
ELECTRIC CARS YOU HAVE YOU

01:43:52.125 --> 01:43:53.927
HAVE FOR DEMAND RESPONSE ALL

01:43:53.994 --> 01:43:56.296
THESE ARE VERY STRATEGIES

01:43:56.363 --> 01:44:00.400
BUT WHAT I DIDN'T HEAR IS

01:44:00.467 --> 01:44:02.369
EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE DOING ON

01:44:02.436 --> 01:44:04.972
HOW TO INTEGRATE EACH OF THESE

01:44:05.038 --> 01:44:07.007
STRATEGIES MORE QUICKLY BECAUSE

01:44:07.074 --> 01:44:08.175
JUST FROM OUR I'LL JUST TELL

01:44:08.241 --> 01:44:10.277
YOU FROM OUR VANTAGE POINT

01:44:10.344 --> 01:44:12.079
IT SEEMS TO MOVE AT A FAIRLY

01:44:12.145 --> 01:44:14.748
GLACIAL THANKS ESPECIALLY GIVEN

01:44:14.815 --> 01:44:16.083
THE SPEED OF OUR STATE AND

01:44:16.149 --> 01:44:20.654
HOW FAST THINGS ARE CHANGING

01:44:20.721 --> 01:44:22.823
I CAN SPEAK TO SOME OF THE

01:44:22.889 --> 01:44:24.091
NEAR TERM THINGS THAT WE'RE

01:44:24.157 --> 01:44:25.792
DOING AS I SAID WE WE ARE

01:44:25.859 --> 01:44:27.527
HAVING AN EXPEDITED RULEMAKING

01:44:27.594 --> 01:44:28.729
PROCESS THAT WILL TAKE INTO

01:44:28.795 --> 01:44:30.030
CONSIDERATION MANY OF THE

01:44:30.097 --> 01:44:31.064
THINGS THAT WE'VE OUTLINED

01:44:31.131 --> 01:44:33.967
TODAY -- WE DO NEED TO LOOK

01:44:34.034 --> 01:44:35.769
AT DEMAND RESPONSE AND AND

01:44:35.836 --> 01:44:37.371
MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE BRINGING

01:44:37.437 --> 01:44:40.240
TECHNOLOGIES TO IT AS WELL AS

01:44:40.307 --> 01:44:42.943
ON FLEX ALERT FRANKLY OF FIVE

01:44:43.010 --> 01:44:45.278
FLEX ALERT IS ANOTHER -- LOVERS

01:44:45.345 --> 01:44:47.547
THAT WE PULLED SUCCESSFULLY

01:44:47.614 --> 01:44:48.615
DURING THE FOURTEENTH AND THE

01:44:48.682 --> 01:44:49.983
FIFTEENTH AND AGAIN IN EARLY

01:44:50.050 --> 01:44:53.553
SEPTEMBER HEAT WAVE -- AND WE

01:44:53.620 --> 01:44:57.691
WE HAVE ALL AGREED ON THAT FLEX

01:44:57.758 --> 01:44:59.593
ALERT NEEDS TO BE MODERNIZED

01:44:59.660 --> 01:45:01.495
PEOPLE BE ABLE WE NEED TO HAVE

01:45:01.561 --> 01:45:03.764
AN APP TYPE OF PROCESS WHERE

01:45:03.830 --> 01:45:06.933
CUSTOMERS CAN -- BE ENGAGED

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.069
IN THE FLEX IN A MUCH MORE

01:45:09.136 --> 01:45:10.570
TECHNOLOGICAL MANNER THAT WE

01:45:10.637 --> 01:45:11.938
ARE NOW DOING IT HASN'T REALLY

01:45:12.005 --> 01:45:13.306
BEEN LOOKED AT FOR FIFTEEN

01:45:13.373 --> 01:45:15.709
YEARS SO WE HAVE TO DO THAT --

01:45:15.776 --> 01:45:17.844
IMMEDIATELY SOME OF THE THINGS

01:45:17.911 --> 01:45:20.547
THAT IN THE SHORT TERM THE IN

01:45:20.614 --> 01:45:23.417
-- THE THE THINGS THAT WILL BE

01:45:23.483 --> 01:45:25.585
BOTTOM LINE -- HAVE BEEN TALKED

01:45:25.652 --> 01:45:26.653
ABOUT BUT I CAN GIVE YOU SOME

01:45:26.720 --> 01:45:29.122
NUMBERS THE ENERGY STORAGE WE

01:45:29.189 --> 01:45:30.424
WILL HAVE ONE THOUSAND FOUR

01:45:30.490 --> 01:45:31.725
SIXTY ONE MEGAWATTS BROUGHT

01:45:31.792 --> 01:45:33.727
ON BY NEXT SUMMER IN ENERGY

01:45:33.794 --> 01:45:35.996
STORAGE AND SOLAR PLUS STORAGE

01:45:36.063 --> 01:45:37.197
WILL HAVE SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY

01:45:37.264 --> 01:45:39.599
SIX MEGAWATTS ON BOARD ONLINE

01:45:39.666 --> 01:45:41.234
SKEWS ME SELLER A HUNDRED

01:45:41.301 --> 01:45:43.236
AND FIFTY EIGHT MEGAWATTS WIN

01:45:43.303 --> 01:45:45.639
A HUNDRED ELEVEN AND OTHER

01:45:45.706 --> 01:45:47.307
WHICH IS MOSTLY GEOTHERMAL

01:45:47.374 --> 01:45:49.109
BE ABOUT TWELVE MEGAWATTS FOR

01:45:49.176 --> 01:45:50.544
ALMOST TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED

01:45:50.610 --> 01:45:52.446
MEGAWATTS THAT WILL BE ONLINE

01:45:52.512 --> 01:45:53.814
BY EIGHT ONE TWENTY TWENTY

01:45:53.880 --> 01:45:55.482
ONE AND THAT'S IN THE IN THE

01:45:55.549 --> 01:45:57.984
SHORT TERM -- AREA THAT WE

01:45:58.051 --> 01:45:59.986
WILL BE BRINGING ON I THINK

01:46:00.053 --> 01:46:02.122
MY FELLOW COLLEAGUES MAY HAVE

01:46:02.189 --> 01:46:03.490
SOME OTHER POINTS TO MAKE

01:46:03.557 --> 01:46:04.758
YEAH I GUESS I COULD JUST ADD

01:46:04.825 --> 01:46:06.159
TO THAT MEAN ONE SECTOR AS

01:46:06.226 --> 01:46:07.594
WELL AS IMPLEMENTING IS THE

01:46:07.661 --> 01:46:09.029
BUILDING SECTOR SO THROUGH

01:46:09.096 --> 01:46:10.797
OUR CODES AND STANDARDS FOR

01:46:10.864 --> 01:46:13.100
NEW CONSTRUCTION WE'RE HELPING

01:46:13.166 --> 01:46:15.035
ENSURE THAT THE BUILDINGS CAN

01:46:15.102 --> 01:46:18.238
BE INTELLIGENT AS THEY INTERACT

01:46:18.305 --> 01:46:19.673
LOAD MANAGEMENT STANDARDS WHICH

01:46:19.740 --> 01:46:21.041
IS BASICALLY PLATFORM IT'S

01:46:21.108 --> 01:46:22.976
GONNA REQUIRE THE UTILITIES

01:46:23.043 --> 01:46:25.846
TO -- TO BE ABLE TO INTEGRATE

01:46:25.912 --> 01:46:27.314
-- THESE ARE TECHNOLOGIES

01:46:27.380 --> 01:46:29.282
THAT THESE FEATURES THAT ARE

01:46:29.349 --> 01:46:32.319
GOING TO ALLOW A FOR -- SMART

01:46:32.385 --> 01:46:34.287
TECHNOLOGY TO HELP ADJUST AND

01:46:34.354 --> 01:46:35.956
MODULATE DEMANDED REAL TIME

01:46:36.022 --> 01:46:38.225
-- I WANTED TO JUST RESPOND

01:46:38.291 --> 01:46:39.993
TO ONE HIGHER LEVEL THEME

01:46:40.060 --> 01:46:40.961
THAT I'M HEARING AND SOME OF

01:46:41.027 --> 01:46:42.829
THE COMMENTS TODAY WHICH IS

01:46:42.896 --> 01:46:44.598
THE NOTION THAT SOMEHOW THE

01:46:44.664 --> 01:46:46.466
CARBONIZATION IS NOT COMPATIBLE

01:46:46.533 --> 01:46:48.135
WITH RELIABILITY ONE INTERESTED

01:46:48.201 --> 01:46:49.870
REALLY ADDRESS THAT DIRECTLY

01:46:49.936 --> 01:46:51.037
BECAUSE IF YOU ASK THE QUESTION

01:46:51.104 --> 01:46:53.473
WHAT ARE THE TOP THREATS TO

01:46:53.540 --> 01:46:54.708
GRID RELIABILITY THE CITY

01:46:54.775 --> 01:46:56.276
CALIFORNIA LAST TWENTY YEARS

01:46:56.343 --> 01:46:58.044
RIGHT AND LOOK AT HOW THAT

01:46:58.111 --> 01:46:59.713
STACKS UP AGAINST CLEAN ENERGY

01:46:59.780 --> 01:47:00.647
RIGHT SO YOU HAVE THE ENERGY

01:47:00.714 --> 01:47:02.749
CRISIS THE TWO THOUSAND ONE

01:47:02.816 --> 01:47:04.184
WHICH WAS MARKET MANIPULATION

01:47:04.251 --> 01:47:06.086
CAUSED BY COMPANIES LIKE ENRON

01:47:06.153 --> 01:47:07.554
IF THIRTY EIGHT STATES THREE

01:47:07.621 --> 01:47:09.823
EMERGENCIES IN TWO THOUSAND ONE

01:47:09.890 --> 01:47:11.758
AGAIN CLEARLY PERFORM RELIABLY

01:47:11.825 --> 01:47:14.427
THAT -- SONGS GOING DOWN SANOFI

01:47:14.494 --> 01:47:16.696
PLAYSTATION TWENTY TWELVE OF

01:47:16.763 --> 01:47:18.098
RENEWABLES CONTINUE TO POOR

PERFORMER LIVELY DURING THAT

01:47:19.466 --> 01:47:21.101
THE METCALF SUBSTATION ATTACK

AND LISA CANYON TWENTY FIFTEEN

01:47:27.741 --> 01:47:28.975
-- SAME THING AND OF COURSE

01:47:29.042 --> 01:47:30.710
THE PS PS EVENTS THAT WE'VE

01:47:30.777 --> 01:47:33.213
HAD SINCE TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND

01:47:33.280 --> 01:47:34.548
THROUGHOUT ALL THESE RENEWABLES

01:47:34.614 --> 01:47:36.416
HAVE CONTINUED TO PERFORM

01:47:36.483 --> 01:47:38.451
RELIABLY AND YOU KNOW LOOKING

01:47:38.518 --> 01:47:40.187
AT THE SUITE OF TECHNOLOGY

01:47:40.253 --> 01:47:41.254
I'VE BEEN REALLY FORTUNATE

01:47:41.321 --> 01:47:42.923
JOB I INNER INTERFACE ALL THE

01:47:42.989 --> 01:47:45.225
TIME WITH INNOVATORS AROUND

01:47:45.292 --> 01:47:46.993
THE STATE LOOKING AT THE SUITE

01:47:47.060 --> 01:47:48.829
OF TECHNOLOGIES THAT'S COMING

01:47:48.895 --> 01:47:49.996
-- IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS IS

01:47:50.063 --> 01:47:51.464
ACTUALLY REALLY INSPIRING THERE

01:47:51.531 --> 01:47:53.767
ARE A LOT OF SOLUTIONS -- SOME

01:47:53.834 --> 01:47:54.668
OF WHICH ARE HERE RIGHT NOW

01:47:54.734 --> 01:47:56.369
ONE THING THAT WE FUNDED --

01:47:56.436 --> 01:47:58.238
WAS ONLY CONNECT THE COMPANY

01:47:58.305 --> 01:47:59.639
FUNDED -- WITH MONEY COLLECTED

01:47:59.706 --> 01:48:01.341
BY THE PC THE GIVEN OUT TO

01:48:01.408 --> 01:48:03.143
RAPID PROGRAM THEY SAVE YOU

01:48:03.210 --> 01:48:05.011
KNOW GIGAWATT HOUR OF POWER

01:48:05.078 --> 01:48:05.779
THEY HAVE A HUNDRED FIFTY

01:48:05.846 --> 01:48:07.914
THOUSAND -- YOU KNOW CUSTOMERS

01:48:07.981 --> 01:48:09.449
AROUND THE STATE PEOPLE TURN

01:48:09.516 --> 01:48:11.117
OFF JUST THESE THESE WHEN YOU

01:48:11.184 --> 01:48:12.652
HAVE A BLACK OFTEN IT'S JUST

01:48:12.719 --> 01:48:14.654
VERY VERY FINITE AMOUNT OF

01:48:14.721 --> 01:48:16.022
TIME WITH THE GREATEST SUPER

01:48:16.089 --> 01:48:17.991
STRESSED SO ALL OF THOSE

01:48:18.058 --> 01:48:20.427
THOUSAND POINTS OF LIGHT --

01:48:20.493 --> 01:48:21.561
RATHER THOUSAND PUTS PEOPLE

01:48:21.628 --> 01:48:22.963
TURN OUT THE LIGHTS -- CAN

01:48:23.029 --> 01:48:24.231
HELP AND DOES HELP AND WE'RE

01:48:24.297 --> 01:48:25.632
GETTING A LOT SMARTER ABOUT

01:48:25.699 --> 01:48:26.900
ABOUT THAT BECAUSE I THINK THE

01:48:26.967 --> 01:48:29.302
OLD VISION THE OLD PHILOSOPHY

01:48:29.369 --> 01:48:31.805
WAS DEMAND IS THE STATIC BEING

01:48:31.872 --> 01:48:33.306
THAT'S UNCHANGED INTERCEPTED ME

01:48:33.373 --> 01:48:35.408
GENERATION THAT PROVIDER IS TO

01:48:35.475 --> 01:48:36.943
MEET THAT DEMAND AND AND REALLY

01:48:37.010 --> 01:48:37.978
WHAT WE'RE FINDING THERE'S

01:48:38.044 --> 01:48:39.813
A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT DEMAND

01:48:39.880 --> 01:48:41.214
THAT CAN BE MOVED IF YOU'RE

01:48:41.281 --> 01:48:42.582
AND THAT INCLUDES PRE COOLEY

01:48:42.649 --> 01:48:44.351
OF BUILDINGS AND CHARGING OF

01:48:44.417 --> 01:48:45.719
ELECTRIC SCHOOL BUS FLEETS

01:48:45.785 --> 01:48:47.454
AND ALL THIS STUFF SO I THINK

01:48:47.520 --> 01:48:50.090
WE THIS IS A SOLVABLE PROBLEM

01:48:50.156 --> 01:48:51.091
WE HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENT

01:48:51.157 --> 01:48:52.225
TOOLS UNDER DEVELOPMENT

01:48:52.292 --> 01:48:56.563
TO HELP US GET THERE

01:48:56.630 --> 01:48:58.298
HELLO COMPLETED IT'S CLEAR THAT

01:48:58.365 --> 01:48:59.599
ACTUALLY DECARBONISATION IN

01:48:59.666 --> 01:49:01.835
THE NEW ENERGY -- CONTINUE TO

01:49:01.902 --> 01:49:04.137
WORK THAT THAT WAS COMPLETELY

01:49:04.204 --> 01:49:06.339
RELIABLE THERE THERE WERE NO

01:49:06.406 --> 01:49:08.041
-- YOU KNOW WE PREDICTED HOW

01:49:08.108 --> 01:49:08.909
MUCH THEY WOULD GENERATE HOW

01:49:08.975 --> 01:49:10.710
MUCH ENERGY WOULD GENERATE THE

01:49:10.777 --> 01:49:13.146
ENERGY WAS GENERATED -- I THINK

01:49:13.213 --> 01:49:14.581
THE KEY THAT YOU HIGHLIGHT IT

01:49:14.648 --> 01:49:17.751
IS WE NEED TO BETTER MANAGE

01:49:17.817 --> 01:49:19.419
THE DEMAND SIDE THAT'S WHY I

01:49:19.486 --> 01:49:21.054
THINK DEMAND RESPONSES SO IS

01:49:21.121 --> 01:49:23.790
SO CRITICAL I DO I DO THINK

01:49:23.857 --> 01:49:26.326
IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT THAT WE

01:49:26.393 --> 01:49:29.629
BETTER -- BETTER LOOK AT HOW WE

01:49:29.696 --> 01:49:31.665
CAN MAKE THE RENEWABLE ENERGY

01:49:31.731 --> 01:49:33.867
SIDE MUCH MORE RELIABLE WELL

01:49:33.934 --> 01:49:34.901
I THINK THERE ARE DIFFERENT

01:49:34.968 --> 01:49:36.569
TOOLS THAT WE COULD USE TO

01:49:36.636 --> 01:49:37.871
MAKE A MORE RELIABLE AND I

01:49:37.938 --> 01:49:39.906
DON'T THINK WE'VE EVEN BEGUN

01:49:39.973 --> 01:49:42.609
TO REALLY -- UTILIZE THOSE

01:49:42.676 --> 01:49:44.144
TOOLS YOU YOU MENTIONED --

01:49:44.210 --> 01:49:46.079
-- CONNECTORS ONE PARTICULAR

01:49:46.146 --> 01:49:47.681
-- DEMAND RESPONSE STRATEGY

01:49:47.747 --> 01:49:49.082
I THINK I THINK YOU HAVE A

01:49:49.149 --> 01:49:51.217
COMPANY WHICH IS INCENTIVIZING

01:49:51.284 --> 01:49:52.686
CUSTOMERS NOT TELLING CUSTOMERS

01:49:52.752 --> 01:49:54.621
BUT THERE IS INVITING CUSTOMERS

01:49:54.688 --> 01:49:56.690
TO USE LESS ENERGY SO CUSTOMERS

01:49:56.756 --> 01:49:58.725
HAVE THAT CHOICE AND IT WORKS

01:49:58.792 --> 01:50:00.961
THEN THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY

01:50:01.027 --> 01:50:02.362
THAT THE STATE IS EQUIVALENT

01:50:02.429 --> 01:50:03.663
TO OUR FIVE FORGOT HOW MANY

01:50:03.730 --> 01:50:05.765
POWER PLANTS SO AGAIN THIS

01:50:05.832 --> 01:50:06.900
IS A GROUP OF THE SIX HUNDRED

01:50:06.967 --> 01:50:08.802
FIFTY THOUSAND HOMES THANK YOU

01:50:08.868 --> 01:50:10.203
TURN OFF I THINK IT'S I THINK

01:50:10.270 --> 01:50:11.304
IT'S A REALLY POOR TO PUT THAT

01:50:11.371 --> 01:50:12.472
IN CONTEXT AND THAT THAT'S A

01:50:12.539 --> 01:50:15.742
SOFTWARE THAT CAN BE DEPLOYED

01:50:15.809 --> 01:50:17.110
VERY VERY QUICKLY AND AGAIN

01:50:17.177 --> 01:50:18.478
IT'S AN INCENTIVE PROGRAM TO

01:50:18.545 --> 01:50:20.847
PEOPLE SIGN ON VOLUNTARILY I

01:50:20.914 --> 01:50:23.049
THINK AGAIN AGAIN I THINK IT'S

01:50:23.116 --> 01:50:25.652
JUST IMPERATIVE THAT WE SPEED

01:50:25.719 --> 01:50:28.321
UP OUR SYSTEMS TO BE ABLE TO

01:50:28.388 --> 01:50:30.557
APPROVED THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES

01:50:30.623 --> 01:50:32.459
QUICKER TO BE ABLE TO INTEGRATE

01:50:32.525 --> 01:50:35.061
THEM INTO OUR SYSTEMS QUICKER

01:50:35.128 --> 01:50:36.830
-- I THINK THAT WE STILL TAKE

01:50:36.896 --> 01:50:38.198
I KNOW IT'S IT'S A IT'S AN

01:50:38.264 --> 01:50:39.399
ONGOING PROCESS BUT I THINK WE

01:50:39.466 --> 01:50:42.535
STILL TAKE WAY TOO LONG TO MOVE

01:50:42.602 --> 01:50:45.338
INTO -- INSURING THAT WE HAVE

01:50:45.405 --> 01:50:47.640

QUESTIONS BUT JUST IT ALONG

01:51:03.990 --> 01:51:06.092
THE LINES OF STORAGE I DID WANT

01:51:06.159 --> 01:51:08.061
TO ASK A QUESTION AND FIRST OF

01:51:08.128 --> 01:51:10.363
ALL I WANT TO BEGIN BY ALIGNING

01:51:10.430 --> 01:51:12.098
MY COMMENTS WITH THE DOCTOR

01:51:16.403 --> 01:51:18.905
HIS COMMENTS ALWAYS EXPRESSED

01:51:18.972 --> 01:51:20.306
EXACTLY HOW WE'RE FEELING WE'RE

01:51:20.373 --> 01:51:22.175
JUST WE FEEL THAT THERE ISN'T

01:51:22.242 --> 01:51:23.777
A SENSE OF URGENCY AS THERE

01:51:23.843 --> 01:51:25.545
SHOULD BE AND THIS ISN'T THE

01:51:25.612 --> 01:51:27.280
FIRST TIME WE'VE SENATE WHICH

01:51:27.347 --> 01:51:28.581
SAID THIS A NUMBER OF TIMES

01:51:28.648 --> 01:51:30.216
WE'VE HAD NUMBER OF HEARINGS

01:51:30.283 --> 01:51:31.484
WHAT WE KEEP SAYING THE SAME

01:51:31.551 --> 01:51:34.554

ABOUT IT AS WELL DR EGGMAN JUST

01:51:36.956 --> 01:51:39.459
TALKED ABOUT IT WE HAVE TO HAVE

01:51:39.526 --> 01:51:41.795
A SENSE OF URGENCY OTHERWISE WE

01:51:41.861 --> 01:51:43.196
WILL HAVE A HEARING NEXT YEAR

01:51:43.263 --> 01:51:44.931

01:51:44.998 --> 01:51:46.199
AND WE WILL HEAR THAT WE'RE

01:51:46.266 --> 01:51:48.935
MOVING ALONG WE'RE MOVING ALONG

01:51:49.002 --> 01:51:50.804
COUNTESS ANISE PARTNERS WE

01:51:50.870 --> 01:51:52.405
WANT TO SEE YOU SUCCEED BECAUSE

01:51:52.472 --> 01:51:54.607
WHEN YOU SUCCEED THEN THE REST

01:51:54.674 --> 01:51:55.708
OF OUR CONSTITUENTS ARE GOING

01:51:55.775 --> 01:51:57.977
TO BE SERVED PROPERLY NOW ON

01:51:58.044 --> 01:52:02.382
THE ISSUE OF STORAGE I THE

01:52:02.449 --> 01:52:05.518
FORMER CHAIRMAN JOHN WILLING

01:52:05.585 --> 01:52:07.554
HOME WROTE THE CALIFORNIA

01:52:07.620 --> 01:52:10.323
HAS MORE THAN FIFTY I'M SORRY

01:52:10.390 --> 01:52:11.558
FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY MEGAWATTS

01:52:11.624 --> 01:52:13.026
OF BEHIND THE METER BATTERY

01:52:13.093 --> 01:52:14.727
CAPACITY THE COULD HAVE BEEN

01:52:14.794 --> 01:52:18.331
CALLED UPON TO REDUCE LOADED

01:52:18.398 --> 01:52:19.566
BUT ONLY ABOUT THREE HUNDRED

01:52:19.632 --> 01:52:22.168
TEN MEGAWATTS WERE USED THE

01:52:22.235 --> 01:52:24.571
NEW YORK TIMES WROTE ABOUT THIS

01:52:24.637 --> 01:52:27.207
AS WELL WROTE WE WERE ALREADY

01:52:27.273 --> 01:52:29.909
ABLE TO REDUCE THE SEVERITY OF

01:52:29.976 --> 01:52:33.012
BLACKOUTS AND MY FIRST QUESTION

01:52:33.079 --> 01:52:35.448
IS WHY WASN'T THIS FULL BETTER

01:52:35.515 --> 01:52:41.287
BATTERY CAPACITY UTILIZED

01:52:41.354 --> 01:52:44.057
-- STEVE DO YOU WANNA TRY AND

01:52:44.124 --> 01:52:45.158
WELL THE BEST I CAN ANSWER

01:52:45.225 --> 01:52:47.527
THAT IS -- THE BATTERIES --

01:52:47.594 --> 01:52:48.795
DO PRESENT THEMSELVES IN OUR

01:52:48.862 --> 01:52:50.697
MARKET AND EVERYTHING THAT WAS

01:52:50.763 --> 01:52:53.133
OFFERED AND WAS DISPATCHABLE

01:52:53.199 --> 01:52:55.401
WAS USED -- SO OBVIOUSLY

01:52:55.468 --> 01:52:56.669
THERE'S SOMETHING STILL OUT

01:52:56.736 --> 01:52:58.905
THERE THAT'S NOT BEING OFFERED

01:52:58.972 --> 01:53:00.707
INTO THE MARKET AND WE WILL

01:53:00.773 --> 01:53:02.542
TAKE THAT IS -- SOMETHING

01:53:02.609 --> 01:53:04.644
TO LOOK INTO BUT YOU'RE NOT

01:53:04.711 --> 01:53:05.678
HEARING THIS FOR THE FIRST TIME

01:53:05.745 --> 01:53:07.013
I MEAN YOU ARE AWARE THAT THIS

01:53:07.080 --> 01:53:11.017
CRITICISM HAD BEEN LEVELLED

01:53:11.084 --> 01:53:13.720
WELL I MEAN THIS IS YOU KNOW

01:53:13.786 --> 01:53:15.688
THIS WHOLE INCIDENT HAS BEEN

01:53:15.755 --> 01:53:16.990
VIEWED FROM ALL KINDS OF

01:53:17.056 --> 01:53:19.659
DIFFERENT LENSES -- I WILL SAY

01:53:19.726 --> 01:53:22.896
THIS THAT I DO THINK CALIFORNIA

01:53:22.962 --> 01:53:24.898
SHOULD BE THE MOST INNOVATIVE

01:53:24.964 --> 01:53:28.601
-- STATE THE -- THAT THERE IS

01:53:28.668 --> 01:53:30.003
AND SHOULD BE ABLE TO UNLOCK

01:53:30.069 --> 01:53:32.005
ALL THESE RESOURCES AND WE

01:53:32.071 --> 01:53:33.473
WILL ALL HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER

01:53:33.540 --> 01:53:35.642
TO DO THAT I CAN TELL YOU THE

01:53:35.708 --> 01:53:37.377
I SO DOES NOT DO PROCUREMENT

01:53:37.443 --> 01:53:38.678
I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT

01:53:38.745 --> 01:53:41.548
THAT WE OPERATE THE GRID AND

01:53:41.614 --> 01:53:43.449
THE RESOURCES THAT ARE GIVEN

01:53:43.516 --> 01:53:45.285
TO US WE TRY TO OPTIMIZE AMONG

01:53:45.351 --> 01:53:47.820
OPERATE THEM AS BEST WE CAN WE

01:53:47.887 --> 01:53:49.989
DO HAVE STORAGE INDOOR MARKETS

01:53:50.056 --> 01:53:52.625
-- MOST OF THE STORAGE I

01:53:52.692 --> 01:53:54.427
BELIEVE THAT THE MISTER WHELAN

01:53:54.494 --> 01:53:56.729
OFFICE REFERRING TO IS BEHIND

01:53:56.796 --> 01:53:59.966
THE METER -- THERE AT HOMES

01:54:00.033 --> 01:54:01.935
WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THAT

01:54:02.001 --> 01:54:04.237
DIRECTLY IT HAS TO COME THROUGH

01:54:04.304 --> 01:54:06.506
AN INTERMEDIARY OF SOME SIDE OF

01:54:06.573 --> 01:54:08.841
SOME TIED WHICH GENERALLY MEANS

01:54:08.908 --> 01:54:11.044
THERE HAS TO BE A PROCUREMENT

01:54:11.110 --> 01:54:13.580
PROGRAM TO GO PROCURE IT TO BE

01:54:13.646 --> 01:54:16.082
ABLE TO OFFER INTO OUR MARKET

01:54:16.149 --> 01:54:19.319
SO -- WE WILL I KNOW THAT THE

01:54:19.385 --> 01:54:21.354
PRESIDENT -- BADGERING HER

01:54:21.421 --> 01:54:24.457
TEAM ARE -- URGENTLY LOOKING

01:54:24.524 --> 01:54:27.227
AT ADDITIONAL PROCUREMENTS AND

01:54:27.293 --> 01:54:28.728
THAT INDEED COULD BE PART OF

01:54:28.795 --> 01:54:31.531
IT AND IF I MIGHT -- YOU ALIGN

01:54:31.598 --> 01:54:32.665
YOURSELF WITH DOCTOR KORB WHO

01:54:32.732 --> 01:54:34.434
ARE KNOWN FOR MANY YEARS AND

01:54:34.500 --> 01:54:36.502
-- YOU KNOW I RESPECT HIS HIS

01:54:36.569 --> 01:54:38.271
INSIGHTS ON THESE THINGS I

01:54:38.338 --> 01:54:40.640
COMPLETELY AGREE THAT STORAGE

01:54:40.707 --> 01:54:42.141
IS GOING TO BE A CRITICAL

01:54:42.208 --> 01:54:45.812
ELEMENTS OF THE SOLUTION IT

01:54:45.878 --> 01:54:47.513
IS NOT THE SILVERBOLT FOR

01:54:47.580 --> 01:54:48.715
EVERYTHING THOUGH BECAUSE IT

01:54:48.781 --> 01:54:50.149
ITSELF DOESN'T GENERATE ANY

01:54:50.216 --> 01:54:52.118
POWER AND FURTHERMORE YOU HAVE

01:54:52.185 --> 01:54:53.786
TO BE CAREFUL HOW YOU USE IT

01:54:53.853 --> 01:54:55.922
OTHERWISE YOU'RE JUST CHARGING

01:54:55.989 --> 01:54:59.192
IT WITH NON YEAH WITH GHG

01:54:59.259 --> 01:55:00.927
EMITTING RESOURCES SO THAT HAS

01:55:00.994 --> 01:55:02.562
TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION BUT

01:55:02.629 --> 01:55:04.163
IN THE STORE JUST GOING TO HAVE

01:55:04.230 --> 01:55:07.066
TO BE ACROSS ALTERATIONS IS

01:55:07.133 --> 01:55:10.536
DOCTOR COURT DISORDERLY ON --

01:55:10.603 --> 01:55:11.971
TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THIS WORK

01:55:12.038 --> 01:55:14.607
FOR OUR LITHIUM ION BATTERIES

01:55:14.674 --> 01:55:17.010
WILL NOT SOLVE THIS LONG TERM

01:55:17.076 --> 01:55:18.911
MEMBER I CAN -- TRYING TO

01:55:18.978 --> 01:55:21.147

SHIELD SAID THERE GOT TO BE

01:55:31.591 --> 01:55:33.660
ON MANY THINGS IN OUR TOOLBOX

01:55:33.726 --> 01:55:35.261
AND WE HAVE TO UTILIZE ALL OF

01:55:35.328 --> 01:55:37.563
THEM AND WE WE DO HAVE A SENSE

01:55:37.630 --> 01:55:41.234

WHICH PERHAPS DOESN'T SEEM LIKE

01:56:32.719 --> 01:56:34.854

02:04:49.081 --> 02:04:51.116
THAT IS NOT JUST ONE FORECAST

02:04:51.183 --> 02:04:53.485
-- WE DOUBLE UP AND BOTH A ONE

02:04:53.552 --> 02:04:56.522
INTO FORECAST A ONE IN FIVE ONE

02:04:56.589 --> 02:04:58.657
IN TEN AND A ONE IN TWENTY SO

02:04:58.724 --> 02:05:00.559
WE WE PUT THOSE FORECAST OUT

02:05:00.626 --> 02:05:03.128
FOR AT VEGAS PLANNING PROCESS

02:05:03.195 --> 02:05:05.297
SEES AND SPECIFICALLY FOR THE

02:05:05.364 --> 02:05:07.233
RESOURCE ADEQUACY PROCESS AT

02:05:07.299 --> 02:05:10.436
CPAC -- WE USE THE ONE INTO

02:05:10.502 --> 02:05:12.238
FORECAST SO THE FORECAST

02:05:12.304 --> 02:05:14.607
AVAILABLE IT'S ABOUT HOW WE

02:05:14.673 --> 02:05:15.975
USE THEM AND WE HAD WE WANT

02:05:16.041 --> 02:05:18.043
TO USE THEM SO SPECIFICALLY IN

02:05:18.110 --> 02:05:19.712
TERMS OF WHETHER WE'RE TAKING

02:05:19.778 --> 02:05:22.281
INTO ACCOUNT AS SOME OF THE --

02:05:22.348 --> 02:05:23.749
CHANGING COMPETITORS TO H.

02:05:23.816 --> 02:05:26.485
AS THE WEATHER YES WE DO THAT

02:05:26.552 --> 02:05:28.287
-- SIR SO THERE'S TWO PARTS

02:05:28.354 --> 02:05:30.222
OF FORECASTING ONE IS THE LONG

02:05:30.289 --> 02:05:31.790
TERM WHICH IS THE TEN YEAR

02:05:31.857 --> 02:05:33.859
WHERE WE ACTUALLY -- DOUBLE

02:05:33.926 --> 02:05:35.427
THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY THAT'S

02:05:35.494 --> 02:05:36.862
USED EACH YEAR SO THAT'S A

02:05:36.929 --> 02:05:39.231
LONG TERM PROCESS AND THAT IS

02:05:39.298 --> 02:05:41.934
SPECIFICALLY GOING INTO -- THE

02:05:42.001 --> 02:05:43.769
TRANSMISSION PLANNING PROCESS

02:05:43.836 --> 02:05:45.304
AND WE ALSO DOUBLE UP IN EIGHTY

02:05:45.371 --> 02:05:47.339
SEVEN SIXTY FIVE SO BASICALLY

02:05:47.406 --> 02:05:48.807
AN HOURLY FORECAST OVER THE TEN

02:05:48.874 --> 02:05:51.710
YEARS WHICH GOES INTO THE I.

02:05:51.777 --> 02:05:53.812
R. P. PROCESS ANDERSON AT

02:05:53.879 --> 02:05:54.647
THE SPECIFICALLY WHEN WE'RE

02:05:54.713 --> 02:05:56.482
DISCUSSING TODAY IS CALLED THE

02:05:56.548 --> 02:05:58.417
THEATER HAD PEAK FORECAST SO

02:05:58.484 --> 02:05:59.752
THAT THAT PARTICULAR ONE WE DO

02:05:59.818 --> 02:06:02.354
CONSIDER -- THE DECENT WEATHER

02:06:02.421 --> 02:06:03.856
WE DO WE DO CAN CONSIDER

02:06:03.923 --> 02:06:06.125
DIFFERENT LEVELS OF FORECAST

02:06:06.191 --> 02:06:10.195
THAT COULD BE AVAILABLE

02:06:10.262 --> 02:06:11.697
THANK YOU I MEAN AND I'LL BE

02:06:11.764 --> 02:06:13.399
A LITTLE CRITICAL WE HAVE THE

02:06:13.465 --> 02:06:15.234
SYSTEMS BUT THEY STILL BUILD US

02:06:15.301 --> 02:06:17.436
UP FOR TWO DAYS IN A ROW AND SO

02:06:17.503 --> 02:06:20.639
I HOPE THAT THAT WE TAKE THIS

02:06:20.706 --> 02:06:22.174
AS A LEARNING LESSON THAT YOU

02:06:22.241 --> 02:06:23.309
KNOW WELL I I KNOW IT'S HARD

02:06:23.375 --> 02:06:24.677
TO PREDICT HOW THE SEND MAIL

02:06:24.743 --> 02:06:25.744
TO THAT WAS HARD TO PREDICT THE

02:06:25.811 --> 02:06:27.146
PANDEMIC THIS CALL THE OTHER

02:06:27.212 --> 02:06:28.747
ONE AROUND THE CORNER SO WE

02:06:28.814 --> 02:06:31.717
HAVE TO BE AT THINK -- MICHAEL

02:06:31.784 --> 02:06:34.019
OF THAT -- MY NEXT COMMENT

02:06:34.086 --> 02:06:36.355
IN QUESTION IS AROUND EQUITY

02:06:36.422 --> 02:06:38.924
SPECIFICALLY -- MY COLLEAGUE

02:06:38.991 --> 02:06:40.092
WITH EMPHASIS WILL STEP OUT OF

02:06:40.159 --> 02:06:41.660
THE ROOM BUT HE TALKED ABOUT

02:06:41.727 --> 02:06:44.430
ASKING CONSUMERS TO USE LESS

02:06:44.496 --> 02:06:46.065
THAN ON THE MEN'S SIDE AND I

02:06:46.131 --> 02:06:47.299
FIND THAT REALLY PROBLEMATIC

02:06:47.366 --> 02:06:48.267
IN THE DISTRICT WHERE I KNOW

02:06:48.334 --> 02:06:49.868
MY CONSUMERS ARE ALREADY USING

02:06:49.935 --> 02:06:51.236
A LOT LESS ON A REGULAR BASIS

02:06:51.303 --> 02:06:52.738
BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO

02:06:52.805 --> 02:06:54.640
USE MORE THAN WE DO NOT HAVE

02:06:54.707 --> 02:06:57.142
AIR CONDITIONING -- OUT THERE

02:06:57.209 --> 02:06:59.778
AND SO I FIND I FIND THAT TO

02:06:59.845 --> 02:07:01.246
BE A LITTLE PROBLEMATIC WHEN

02:07:01.313 --> 02:07:04.316
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT -- ABOUT

02:07:04.383 --> 02:07:05.884
EQUITY OUT THERE WHO'S WEARING

02:07:05.951 --> 02:07:06.952
THE BROWN AT THE END OF THE DAY

02:07:07.019 --> 02:07:08.654
THESE COMMUNITIES I WOULD WE

02:07:08.721 --> 02:07:09.989
HAVE THE CITY THIS MOMENTS OUT

02:07:10.055 --> 02:07:12.424
THERE WHERE IF I DON'T HAVE A

02:07:12.491 --> 02:07:14.159
WORKING REFRIGERATOR DEFINITELY

02:07:14.226 --> 02:07:15.961
LAS IMPACTS ME THAT MUCH MORE

02:07:16.028 --> 02:07:17.062
IT IS SO MUCH HARDER FOR ME TO

02:07:17.129 --> 02:07:19.298
REPLACE IT OUT THERE AND SO I

02:07:19.365 --> 02:07:20.632
JUST WANTED TO BE MINDFUL AND

02:07:20.699 --> 02:07:22.034
LYFT DO WANT TO REMIND FOLKS

02:07:22.101 --> 02:07:23.035
USE LEFT AND THERE'S A LOT

02:07:23.102 --> 02:07:24.003
OF FOLKS WE COULD DEFINITELY

02:07:24.069 --> 02:07:25.871
USE LESS I THINK WE NEED TO

02:07:25.938 --> 02:07:26.972
BE REALLY CAREFUL ABOUT THE

02:07:27.039 --> 02:07:27.906
STATEMENT ON WE'RE TALKING

02:07:27.973 --> 02:07:30.075
ABOUT EQUITY OUT THERE IN THIS

02:07:30.142 --> 02:07:31.176
THING I THINK THEY'RE THINKING

02:07:31.243 --> 02:07:33.078
OR TALKING ABOUT INVESTING

02:07:33.145 --> 02:07:35.547
IN WHETHER IT'S HYDRO STORAGE

02:07:35.614 --> 02:07:37.816
OR BIOMASS WHO'S GOING TO BE

02:07:37.883 --> 02:07:39.418
PAYING FOR THAT WE HAVE TO

02:07:39.485 --> 02:07:40.953
I'LL USE THAT HAVE LISTEN THIS

02:07:41.020 --> 02:07:42.821
CUSTOMERS AND BUT WE STILL HAVE

02:07:42.888 --> 02:07:44.356
HAD SYSTEMS WILL RELY ON THEM

02:07:44.423 --> 02:07:46.358
FOR THESE BIG INVESTMENTS ON

02:07:46.425 --> 02:07:47.393
AND SO HOW ARE WE CREATING A

02:07:47.459 --> 02:07:49.061
SYSTEM THAT'S MORE EQUITABLE

02:07:49.128 --> 02:07:50.696
ALL ALONG THE WAY I LIVE IN A

02:07:50.763 --> 02:07:52.197
DISTRICT WHERE MOST OF MY BOOKS

02:07:52.264 --> 02:07:53.132
ARE PLUGGED INTO THE I.

02:07:53.198 --> 02:07:54.266
O. USE AND NOT THAT ALL THESE

02:07:54.333 --> 02:07:55.334
OTHER ALTERNATIVES AND WE

02:07:55.401 --> 02:07:56.735
END UP WEARING THE BRIGHT THE

02:07:56.802 --> 02:07:58.137
BRIGHT WHEN THE COSTS ARE FAR

02:07:58.203 --> 02:07:59.972
ENOUGH OUT THERE BOARD SOME

02:08:00.039 --> 02:08:01.273
OF THE LEAST BENEFICIARY FOLKS

02:08:01.340 --> 02:08:03.575
OUT THERE -- AND SO I JUST WANT

02:08:03.642 --> 02:08:04.443
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE BEING

02:08:04.510 --> 02:08:06.045
MINDFUL AND EQUITABLE THAT

02:08:06.111 --> 02:08:07.880
DISCUSSIONS MIGHT DECISIONS

02:08:07.946 --> 02:08:09.214
AS YOU GUYS ARE PLANNING I

02:08:09.281 --> 02:08:11.150
HAD TO THIS IS A COMMENT MY

02:08:11.216 --> 02:08:12.217
LAST QUESTION THOUGH IS ABOUT

02:08:12.284 --> 02:08:13.318
THE FIFTEEN PERCENT THAT WERE

02:08:13.385 --> 02:08:15.120
SUPPOSED TO BE HAVING FOR

02:08:15.187 --> 02:08:17.189
OUR SERVICE WE USUALLY HAVE

02:08:17.256 --> 02:08:18.057
A LITTLE BIT LESS THAN THAT

02:08:18.123 --> 02:08:19.992
ACTUALLY CLOSER TO TEN PERCENT

02:08:20.059 --> 02:08:21.326
I IT WE WOULD HAVE TO FIFTEEN

02:08:21.393 --> 02:08:24.129
PERCENT WE HAVE AVERTED --

02:08:24.196 --> 02:08:28.033
THE STUDENTS TO THESE TWO DAYS

02:08:28.100 --> 02:08:30.702
WELL WE DID HAVE -- FIFTEEN

02:08:30.769 --> 02:08:34.339
PERCENT -- RESERVE BUT STEVE

02:08:34.406 --> 02:08:36.241
DO YOU WANNA DIRECTLY AFFECTED

02:08:36.308 --> 02:08:38.844
SO THE FORECAST ON THOSE DATES

02:08:38.911 --> 02:08:40.279
ON THEIR TUITION WAS FORTY

02:08:40.345 --> 02:08:41.780
FORTY FIVE GIGAWATTS ACTUAL

02:08:41.847 --> 02:08:44.416
LOAD WAS FORTY SEVEN SO IF

02:08:44.483 --> 02:08:45.617
YOU HAVE THE FULL FIFTEEN

02:08:45.684 --> 02:08:47.820
PERCENT WE WE WOULD HAVE IN

02:08:47.886 --> 02:08:49.088
THERE WERE SOME OBVIOUSLY

02:08:49.154 --> 02:08:50.389
SOME EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES

02:08:50.456 --> 02:08:52.491
BUT I IF I COULD -- WITH YOUR

02:08:52.558 --> 02:08:54.526
PERMISSION JUST -- RESPOND TO

02:08:54.593 --> 02:08:55.894
WHEN YOUR EARLIER POINTS WAS UP

02:08:55.961 --> 02:08:57.329
HERE RIGHT WELL I JUST WANTED

02:08:57.396 --> 02:08:59.198
TO DIRECTLY ADDRESS BECAUSE

02:08:59.264 --> 02:09:02.367
EQUITY IS THE FRONT DOOR TO

02:09:02.434 --> 02:09:04.236
OUR STATE'S CLIMATE POLICY

02:09:04.303 --> 02:09:05.504
AND EVERYTHING WE'RE DOING I

02:09:05.571 --> 02:09:06.438
MENTIONED A NUMBER OF THESE

02:09:06.505 --> 02:09:07.639
ENERGY STORAGE DEMONSTRATION

02:09:07.706 --> 02:09:09.708
PROJECTS SIXTY FIVE PERCENT OF

02:09:09.775 --> 02:09:11.043
OUR DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS FOR

02:09:11.110 --> 02:09:12.945
THESE NEW CLEAN TECHNOLOGIES

02:09:13.011 --> 02:09:14.713
IS ARE IN DISADVANTAGED LOW

02:09:14.780 --> 02:09:16.448
INCOME COMMUNITIES EVERY SINGLE

02:09:16.515 --> 02:09:18.851
PROGRAM WE'RE DOING IN THIS NEW

02:09:18.917 --> 02:09:20.352
BUILDING DECARBONIZATION EIGHTY

02:09:20.419 --> 02:09:22.688
MILLION DOLLAR PROGRAM -- THAT

02:09:22.754 --> 02:09:25.524
WAS -- HAD CENTER STERN LET ME

02:09:25.591 --> 02:09:26.725
KNOW THAT'S EXCLUSIVE GROUP FOR

02:09:26.792 --> 02:09:28.160
LOW INCOME THIS IS BEEN A BIG

02:09:28.227 --> 02:09:29.962
FOCUS FOR ALL OF US -- AND I

02:09:30.028 --> 02:09:31.263
DO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE I THINK

02:09:31.330 --> 02:09:33.065
THAT'S A NEW DEVELOPMENT THE

02:09:33.132 --> 02:09:34.833
LAST FEW YEARS ARE VERY WELCOME

02:09:34.900 --> 02:09:35.934
ONE I THINK IT'S A MODEL FOR

02:09:36.001 --> 02:09:37.536
THE FOR THE COUNTRY AND THEN

02:09:37.603 --> 02:09:39.004
JUST TO THE THE FIRST BORN YOU

02:09:39.071 --> 02:09:41.874
MAKING ABOUT YOU KNOW THE WE

02:09:41.940 --> 02:09:44.009
WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW WE DO

02:09:44.076 --> 02:09:45.644
THE FORECAST IN AND THIS THIS

02:09:45.711 --> 02:09:47.279
WHOLE PLANNING US IT'S REALLY

02:09:47.346 --> 02:09:49.915
BALANCING RELIABILITY WITH THE

02:09:49.982 --> 02:09:52.351
RATES SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT A

02:09:52.417 --> 02:09:54.319
ONE TO ONE INTO PLANNING RIGHT

02:09:54.386 --> 02:09:55.988
THAT'S THERE'S A FIFTY PERCENT

02:09:56.054 --> 02:09:57.990
CHANCE THAT THE ACTUAL DEMAND

02:09:58.056 --> 02:10:00.159
IS GOING TO BE A OF -- WITH

02:10:00.225 --> 02:10:01.627
THE FORECAST IF YOU GO TO ONE

02:10:01.693 --> 02:10:02.928
IN FIVE IT'S A TWENTY PERCENT

02:10:02.995 --> 02:10:04.329
CHANCE IT'LL BE ABOUT ONE IN

02:10:04.396 --> 02:10:05.898
TEN OF THE TEN PERCENT IS YOU

02:10:05.964 --> 02:10:07.733
GET MORE AND MORE SAFETY MARGIN

02:10:07.799 --> 02:10:09.401
THAT ALSO ADDS MORE COST AND

02:10:09.468 --> 02:10:11.336
SO THE GOAL I THINK FOR ALL OF

02:10:11.403 --> 02:10:13.672
US COLLECTIVELY IS TO PROCURE

02:10:13.739 --> 02:10:14.940
ENOUGH SO WE CAN HAVE A HUNDRED

02:10:15.007 --> 02:10:16.008
PERCENT CONFIDENCE IN THE

02:10:16.074 --> 02:10:17.209
RELIABILITY OF THE GRID BUT NOT

02:10:17.276 --> 02:10:18.911
MORE THAN THAT SO WE CONTAIN

02:10:18.977 --> 02:10:20.379
COSTS AND THAT'S THE THAT'S

02:10:20.445 --> 02:10:22.147
THE DOWNSIZING ACTOR I THINK

02:10:22.214 --> 02:10:24.016
YOU KNOW WE WE CAN WE HAVE TO

02:10:24.082 --> 02:10:25.083
YOU BETTER THAN I MEAN YOUR

02:10:25.150 --> 02:10:26.218
POINT AND ALL OF YOUR POINT

02:10:26.285 --> 02:10:29.321
IS WELL TAKEN -- AND NOBODY

02:10:29.388 --> 02:10:30.355
REALLY PAYS ANY ATTENTION

02:10:30.422 --> 02:10:31.490
TO THE STUFF UNTIL WE HAVE A

02:10:31.557 --> 02:10:33.492
FAILURE LIKE WE DID IN AUGUST

02:10:33.559 --> 02:10:34.826
FIRST TIME IN TWENTY YEARS AND

02:10:34.893 --> 02:10:36.461
AND WE HAVE WE GOT TO DO BETTER

02:10:36.528 --> 02:10:37.930
SO I I JUST POINT OF WHICH

02:10:37.996 --> 02:10:39.198
ARE HERE YOU AND AND THANK YOU

02:10:39.264 --> 02:10:44.736
FOR MAKING THAT OBSERVATION

02:10:44.803 --> 02:10:46.104
YEAH I ALSO IT IF I MIGHT

02:10:46.171 --> 02:10:47.472
ABOUT THE FIFTY PERCENT PLAYING

02:10:47.539 --> 02:10:49.441
RESERVE -- -- -- ONE MAKE

02:10:49.508 --> 02:10:50.742
SURE BODIES ON THE SAME PAGE

02:10:50.809 --> 02:10:52.377
SO THERE IS A FIFTEEN PERCENT

02:10:52.444 --> 02:10:54.846
PLANNING RESERVE MARGIN BUT

02:10:54.913 --> 02:10:56.181
WERE REQUIRED TO KEEP SIX

02:10:56.248 --> 02:10:57.816
PERCENT RESERVES SO YOU CAN

02:10:57.883 --> 02:11:00.219
DEDUCT THAT YOU GET TO NINE

02:11:00.285 --> 02:11:01.420
THEN YOU HAVE OUTAGES ON THE

02:11:01.486 --> 02:11:03.789
SYSTEM -- WHICH IS ANOTHER

02:11:03.855 --> 02:11:05.324
FEW PERCENTAGE POINTS SO WHEN

02:11:05.390 --> 02:11:07.559
YOU HAVE A DEVIATION OFF OF

02:11:07.626 --> 02:11:09.127
THE FORECAST THE LONGER TERM

02:11:09.194 --> 02:11:12.631
FORECAST USING A ONE INTO YOUR

02:11:12.698 --> 02:11:13.699
YOU'RE GONNA YOU'RE RUNNING WAY

02:11:13.765 --> 02:11:16.802
TOO CLOSE TO THE MARGIN SO --

02:11:16.868 --> 02:11:18.203
I THINK IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT

02:11:18.270 --> 02:11:19.404
WE INCREASE THE MARGINS THAT

02:11:19.471 --> 02:11:21.773
WE HAVE I CAN GIVE YOU ANOTHER

02:11:21.840 --> 02:11:23.909
EXAMPLE I MEAN WE KNOW THE WIND

02:11:23.976 --> 02:11:25.711
WILL MOVE A THOUSAND MEGAWATTS

02:11:25.777 --> 02:11:28.480
IN AN HOUR UP AND DOWN THAT'S

02:11:28.547 --> 02:11:29.915
THE PHYSICS OF IT WE NEED TO

02:11:29.982 --> 02:11:31.383
KNOW THAT THAT'S HOW IT'S GONNA

02:11:31.450 --> 02:11:32.918
WORK SO YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO X.

02:11:32.985 --> 02:11:34.953
DANGER MARGINS FOR SHOCK

02:11:35.020 --> 02:11:36.622
ABSORBER EVENTS WHETHER THEY BE

02:11:36.688 --> 02:11:39.558
HEAT OR -- YOU KNOW RENEWABLE

02:11:39.625 --> 02:11:42.094
MOVEMENTS -- SO -- THE RESOURCE

02:11:42.160 --> 02:11:43.762
ADEQUACY PROGRAM I ALSO WANNA

02:11:43.829 --> 02:11:45.530
NOTE LOOKS AT THE PEAK OF THE

02:11:45.597 --> 02:11:47.666
DAY THE PEAK OF THE DAY YOU

02:11:47.733 --> 02:11:49.401
CAN SOLVE THAT BY PUTTING MORE

02:11:49.468 --> 02:11:52.204
OF SOLAR AS AN EXAMPLE BUT

02:11:52.271 --> 02:11:53.805
IT DOESN'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM

02:11:53.872 --> 02:11:56.208
AT SEVEN O'CLOCK AT NIGHT --

02:11:56.275 --> 02:11:58.443
WHICH IS WHAT I THINK RESOURCE

02:11:58.510 --> 02:11:59.845
ADEQUACY NEEDS TO REALLY LOOK

02:11:59.911 --> 02:12:01.880
AT IS THOSE PEAK HOURS BECAUSE

02:12:01.947 --> 02:12:03.048
THAT'S WHERE OUR BLACKOUTS

02:12:03.115 --> 02:12:05.317
WERE AND WHEN WE HAVE THE TIGHT

02:12:05.384 --> 02:12:06.551
CONDITIONS ON THE SUBSEQUENT

02:12:06.618 --> 02:12:08.120
DAYS THAT'S WHERE THE RISK WAS

02:12:08.186 --> 02:12:09.688
TOO AND WE ASKED PEOPLE YOU

02:12:09.755 --> 02:12:11.657
MAY RECALL TO CONSERVE FROM

02:12:11.723 --> 02:12:13.292
THREE TO NINE STROLLER THAT

02:12:13.358 --> 02:12:15.694
SORT OF FIVE TO NINE WIN WE

02:12:15.761 --> 02:12:17.162
HAVE HEAVY AIR CONDITIONING

02:12:17.229 --> 02:12:18.930
LOAD STILL ON THE SYSTEM AND

02:12:18.997 --> 02:12:21.066
THE SOLAR IS GONE AND I ALSO

02:12:21.133 --> 02:12:22.668
WANNA NOTE THAT WE HAVE ABOUT

02:12:22.734 --> 02:12:24.002
SEVEN THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF

02:12:24.069 --> 02:12:27.339
BEHIND THE METER SOLAR AS WELL

02:12:27.406 --> 02:12:29.708
SO WHEN THAT SOLAR GOES THAT

02:12:29.775 --> 02:12:31.877
LOAD COMES BACK ON THE SYSTEM

02:12:31.943 --> 02:12:34.179
AND SO YOU CAN SEE THE SWING SO

02:12:34.246 --> 02:12:37.416
I DO THINK -- AND I I KNOW THAT

02:12:37.482 --> 02:12:40.385
MY MY COLLEAGUES UP HERE AGREED

02:12:40.452 --> 02:12:42.454
WE'LL HAVE TO RESOURCE ADEQUACY

02:12:42.521 --> 02:12:45.123
AND MY SUCCESSOR HAS INDICATED

02:12:45.190 --> 02:12:47.326
THAT IT'S A SIZE HIS HIGHEST

02:12:47.392 --> 02:12:49.828
PRIORITY TO YOU KNOW SORT

02:12:49.895 --> 02:12:50.896
THROUGH THESE ROUTE REACHED

02:12:50.962 --> 02:12:53.098
RESOURCE ADEQUACY ISSUES AND

02:12:53.165 --> 02:12:55.367
-- I KNOW THE MY COLLEAGUES

02:12:55.434 --> 02:12:57.235
AT THE UC AND CC RECOGNIZE

02:12:57.302 --> 02:12:59.871
IT TOO SO WE GOT IF THERE'S

02:12:59.938 --> 02:13:00.739
MULTIPLE THINGS THAT NEED

02:13:00.806 --> 02:13:01.773
TO GO ON HERE I THINK THAT'S

02:13:01.840 --> 02:13:05.310
PART OF IT AND I THINK AS --

02:13:05.377 --> 02:13:06.478
PRESENT MATTER INDICATED THERE

02:13:06.545 --> 02:13:07.779
HAS TO BE SOME PROCUREMENT

02:13:07.846 --> 02:13:11.316
AND IT HAS TO BE BE QUICK AND

02:13:11.383 --> 02:13:12.818
WE ARE INDEED IN OUR RESOURCE

02:13:12.884 --> 02:13:15.120
ADEQUACY PROCEEDING LOOKING

02:13:15.187 --> 02:13:17.689
AT THE MARGIN AND SEEING IF

02:13:17.756 --> 02:13:19.057
THE FIFTEEN PERCENT IN LIGHT

02:13:19.124 --> 02:13:23.095
OF WHAT -- WAS JUST STATED IS

02:13:23.161 --> 02:13:25.063
IS AND AND THE CHANGING THAT

02:13:25.130 --> 02:13:27.032
WE'RE EXPERIENCING AND THE NEW

02:13:27.099 --> 02:13:28.266
SOME OF THE NEW FORECASTING

02:13:28.333 --> 02:13:29.634
THAT WE'RE GETTING WE HAVE TO

02:13:29.701 --> 02:13:30.969
MAKE THIS BALLOTS AND WE DO

02:13:31.036 --> 02:13:34.172
HAVE TO DO IT NOW AND WE ARE

02:13:34.239 --> 02:13:35.540
THANK YOU AND -- THAT'S WHAT

02:13:35.607 --> 02:13:36.775
I WAS TRYING TO GET IT AS

02:13:36.842 --> 02:13:38.110
WELL AS OUR PLANE HAD ANYTHING

02:13:38.176 --> 02:13:39.177
THAT'S ON THE SHORT TERM SIDE

02:13:39.244 --> 02:13:40.979
OF THINGS AS A WILL BE COULD

02:13:41.046 --> 02:13:43.081
DO NOW FOR A WHILE RETURNING

02:13:43.148 --> 02:13:46.585
TO BALANCE OUT -- UNFOCUSED I

02:13:46.651 --> 02:13:48.019
I I JUST WANNA SAY I'VE BEEN

02:13:48.086 --> 02:13:49.354
HERE FOR EIGHT YEARS I HAVE

02:13:49.421 --> 02:13:50.789
SEEN THIS DO MORE MORE ON

02:13:50.856 --> 02:13:52.524
EQUITY BUT I WANT TO BE CLEAR

02:13:52.591 --> 02:13:53.759
THAT I FIND IT INADEQUATE AND

02:13:53.825 --> 02:13:55.727
WE HAVEN'T DONE ENOUGH ALONG

02:13:55.794 --> 02:13:57.562
THE WAY INCISE WE AS WE ARE

02:13:57.629 --> 02:13:59.097
DOING THIS WORK I TO SO THAT

02:13:59.164 --> 02:14:01.133
THAT'S TOP OF MIND FOR ALL

02:14:01.199 --> 02:14:02.267
OF US AND HOW WE COULD DO IT

02:14:02.334 --> 02:14:04.169
BETTER WE'VE DONE THINGS LIKE

02:14:04.236 --> 02:14:05.637
THIRTY FIVE PERCENT OF OUR

02:14:05.704 --> 02:14:06.772
CAP AND TRADE DOLLARS LOCAL

02:14:06.838 --> 02:14:08.407
FOR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES

02:14:08.473 --> 02:14:09.608
I FIND THAT TO BE INADEQUATE

02:14:09.674 --> 02:14:10.675
WHEN WE BURN NINETY PERCENT

02:14:10.742 --> 02:14:13.345
OF THE OF THE BURDEN RIGHT SO

02:14:13.412 --> 02:14:15.247
-- I I I DO RECOGNIZE THE WORK

02:14:15.313 --> 02:14:16.248
WE'VE DONE BUT I'M ALWAYS IN

02:14:16.314 --> 02:14:17.449
A STATE WITH THE NEXT UP AND

02:14:17.516 --> 02:14:18.617
HOW DO WE DO BETTER AND SO

02:14:18.683 --> 02:14:20.085
WE'RE IN A CRISIS AND A CRISIS

02:14:20.152 --> 02:14:20.986
MAKES IT REALLY HARD FOR US

02:14:21.052 --> 02:14:22.788
TO THINK ABOUT THAT INNOVATION

02:14:22.854 --> 02:14:23.755
OF HOW DO WE DO BETTER FOR

02:14:23.822 --> 02:14:24.656
THESE COMMUNITY THINKING

02:14:24.723 --> 02:14:26.124
WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY

02:14:26.191 --> 02:14:27.225
TO TAKE THAT OPPORTUNITY

02:14:27.292 --> 02:14:28.393
THAT THE CRISIS CREATES FOR

02:14:28.460 --> 02:14:29.861
CHANGES IN CHANGE IN A MUCH

02:14:29.928 --> 02:14:32.030
MORE EQUITABLE WAY THANK YOU

START TO REPEAT WHAT EVERYBODY

02:14:41.573 --> 02:14:43.542
ELSE HAS HAS SAID -- BUT I

02:14:43.608 --> 02:14:45.076
JUST WANTED TO START OFF BY

02:14:45.143 --> 02:14:46.411
THANKING THE CHAIRMAN FOR

02:14:46.478 --> 02:14:48.413
PUTTING THIS TOGETHER AT TODAY

02:14:48.480 --> 02:14:49.748
BECAUSE YOU CAN TELL AMONG ALL

02:14:49.815 --> 02:14:50.849
THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS OF THIS

02:14:50.916 --> 02:14:52.517
IS BEEN SOMETHING THAT IS THAT

02:14:52.584 --> 02:14:54.786
TOP OF MIND AND WE ALL OF OUR

02:14:54.853 --> 02:14:56.054
PASSION ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT

02:14:56.121 --> 02:14:57.923
WE WE ADDRESS THAT I WAS ALSO

02:14:57.989 --> 02:14:59.958
FASCINATED BY THIS IDEA OF A

02:15:00.025 --> 02:15:02.427
MORAL ELECTRON -- -- -- YOU

02:15:02.494 --> 02:15:04.563
KNOW EARLIER IN THE DISCUSSION

02:15:04.629 --> 02:15:06.231
-- SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE IN

02:15:06.298 --> 02:15:07.199
THE LEGISLATURE JUST BEEN

02:15:07.265 --> 02:15:08.733
SIX YEARS NOW YOU KNOW I'VE

02:15:08.800 --> 02:15:10.502
HAD A LITTLE BIT OF EVOLUTION

02:15:10.569 --> 02:15:12.237
-- OVER -- THESE THESE SIX

02:15:12.304 --> 02:15:14.906
YEARS -- WHEN I CAME IN TO THE

02:15:14.973 --> 02:15:16.475
LEGISLATURE I'M NOT SURE THAT

02:15:16.541 --> 02:15:17.976
I WOULD HAVE -- PRINTOUTS THAT

02:15:18.043 --> 02:15:19.845
CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL TOOK ME

02:15:19.911 --> 02:15:22.814
A COUPLE YEARS -- AND I WOULD

02:15:22.881 --> 02:15:24.816
SAY -- AND I SAID THEN CLIMATE

02:15:24.883 --> 02:15:26.651
CHANGE IS REAL I'LL TELL YOU

02:15:26.718 --> 02:15:29.654
TODAY -- I FIND THAT STATEMENT

02:15:29.721 --> 02:15:31.990
TO BE RIDICULOUS -- THE REASON

02:15:32.057 --> 02:15:33.024
I FIND THAT STATEMENT TO BE

02:15:33.091 --> 02:15:35.227
RIDICULOUS IS IT PRESUMES

02:15:35.293 --> 02:15:38.497
THAT THERE'S STILL ANY DOUBT

02:15:38.563 --> 02:15:40.632
THERE ISN'T ANY DOUBT ABOUT

02:15:40.699 --> 02:15:42.567
IT IN MY COMMUNITY I REPRESENT

02:15:42.634 --> 02:15:44.469
THE COACHELLA VALLEY -- THERE

02:15:44.536 --> 02:15:47.239
ARE DAYS THIS YEAR OR THE

02:15:47.305 --> 02:15:48.173
RECORD HAD BEEN A HUNDRED

02:15:48.240 --> 02:15:49.341
THIRTY FIVE DAYS OF TRIPLE

02:15:49.407 --> 02:15:50.842
DIGIT TEMPERATURES WE'VE BLOWN

02:15:50.909 --> 02:15:52.277
PAST THAT HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE

02:15:52.344 --> 02:15:53.445
DAYS WERE NORTH OF A HUNDRED

02:15:53.512 --> 02:15:55.280
AND FORTY DAYS NOW WE AND WE

02:15:55.347 --> 02:15:56.348
MIGHT END UP WITH A HUNDRED AND

02:15:56.414 --> 02:15:58.116
FIFTY DAYS AND TWENTY TWENTY

02:15:58.183 --> 02:16:00.151
WILL READ HAD TRIPLE DIGIT --

02:16:00.218 --> 02:16:01.253
TEMPERATURES AND SO WHEN WE

02:16:01.319 --> 02:16:03.021
START TO TALK ABOUT A MORAL

02:16:03.088 --> 02:16:05.423
IMPERATIVE THERE IS A MORAL

02:16:05.490 --> 02:16:07.492
IMPERATIVE TO ADDRESS CLIMATE

02:16:07.559 --> 02:16:09.628
CHANGE KNOWING THAT WE -- HAVE

02:16:09.694 --> 02:16:12.397
A RESPONSIBILITY AS A CITIZEN

02:16:12.464 --> 02:16:13.932
CALIFORNIA GLOBAL CITIZENS TO

02:16:13.999 --> 02:16:15.767
ADDRESS THAT THIS LEGISLATURE

02:16:15.834 --> 02:16:17.702
THIS GOVERNMENT -- HAS MADE

02:16:17.769 --> 02:16:18.970
THAT A TOP PRIORITY THAT IS

02:16:19.037 --> 02:16:21.106
NOT NEGOTIABLE ANY LONGER AT

02:16:21.172 --> 02:16:23.608
THE SAME TIME WE HAVE A MORAL

02:16:23.675 --> 02:16:25.477
IMPERATIVE TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:16:25.544 --> 02:16:27.579
THERE'S ENERGY SECURITY AND

02:16:27.646 --> 02:16:29.147
I KNOW WE'VE ALL ADDRESS THAT

02:16:29.214 --> 02:16:32.817
AS WELL IT IS UNACCEPTABLE

02:16:32.884 --> 02:16:35.921
TO LIVE IN PALM DESERT WHERE

02:16:35.987 --> 02:16:36.988
IT'S A HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN

02:16:37.055 --> 02:16:39.190
DEGREES AND GET A NOTICE THAT

02:16:39.257 --> 02:16:41.426
YOUR POWER IS GOING TO BE OUT

02:16:41.493 --> 02:16:43.361
IT IS UNACCEPTABLE THAT EVEN

02:16:43.428 --> 02:16:44.429
WHEN IT COULD BE EIGHT O'CLOCK

02:16:44.496 --> 02:16:45.497
AT NIGHT IT COULD STILL BE A

02:16:45.564 --> 02:16:46.665
HUNDRED AND FIVE OR A HUNDRED

02:16:46.731 --> 02:16:48.633
TEN TO TEN DEGREES AND YOU HAVE

02:16:48.700 --> 02:16:50.502
SENIOR CITIZENS THAT ARE HOME

02:16:50.569 --> 02:16:52.070
IN THAT KIND OF TEMPERATURE

02:16:52.137 --> 02:16:53.772
WITH NO ELECTRICITY AND THEY

02:16:53.838 --> 02:16:55.674
DON'T HAVE ANY BACK UP THAT IS

02:16:55.740 --> 02:16:57.409
ALSO A MORAL IMPERATIVE THAT

02:16:57.475 --> 02:16:59.177
WE HAVE GOT TO TO ADDRESS SO

02:16:59.244 --> 02:17:01.246
AGAIN I'VE I VERY MUCH ENJOY

02:17:01.313 --> 02:17:02.480
HAVE ENJOYED THIS CONVERSATION

02:17:02.547 --> 02:17:04.249
I THINK WE ARE ALL ON THE SAME

02:17:04.316 --> 02:17:06.151
THE SAME PAGE WHAT I HAVEN'T

02:17:06.217 --> 02:17:08.019
YET HEARD BUT I HAVEN'T YET

02:17:08.086 --> 02:17:08.987
HEARD OF MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE I'M

02:17:09.054 --> 02:17:10.956
NOT SMART ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND

02:17:11.022 --> 02:17:12.557
WHAT I HAVEN'T YET HEARD IS

02:17:12.624 --> 02:17:14.793
WHAT'S THE ANSWER TO THIS CAN

02:17:14.859 --> 02:17:16.995
CAN ALL OF YOU GUARANTEE US

02:17:17.062 --> 02:17:20.165
THAT NEXT YEAR THIS ISN'T GOING

02:17:20.231 --> 02:17:23.168
TO HAPPEN CAN YOU GUARANTEE US

02:17:23.234 --> 02:17:24.869
THAT FIVE YEARS FROM NOW THAT

02:17:24.936 --> 02:17:27.505
THIS ISN'T GOING TO HAPPEN

02:17:27.572 --> 02:17:28.907
AND THAT'S I HAVEN'T YET HEARD

02:17:28.974 --> 02:17:30.208
ANSWER FOR THAT AND THEN I ALSO

02:17:30.275 --> 02:17:31.309
WANT TO BRING IT BACK ON US AS

02:17:31.376 --> 02:17:33.278
A LEGISLATOR THE LEGISLATURE

02:17:33.345 --> 02:17:35.480
IS DO YOU NEED MORE TOOLS FROM

02:17:35.547 --> 02:17:38.350
US TO BE ABLE TO ANSWER THIS

02:17:38.416 --> 02:17:40.185
QUESTION BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT

02:17:40.251 --> 02:17:42.454
THESE TO MORAL IMPERATIVES

02:17:42.520 --> 02:17:43.655
TO JUST BEING CONFLICT OR TO

02:17:43.722 --> 02:17:45.590
COLLIDE WE NEED THEM TO RESOLVE

02:17:45.657 --> 02:17:47.259
ONE ANOTHER AND SO WOULD LOVE

02:17:47.325 --> 02:17:48.393
TO BE ABLE THAT UNDERSTANDS

02:17:48.460 --> 02:17:49.761
OR SOMETHING THAT WE CAN DO

02:17:49.828 --> 02:17:51.329
AND ALSO THE QUESTION OF --

02:17:51.396 --> 02:17:52.530
CAN YOU GUARANTEE THAT IN THE

02:17:52.597 --> 02:17:53.665
FUTURE THIS ISN'T GONNA HAPPEN

02:17:53.732 --> 02:17:56.134
AGAIN -- FROM THE MANY THINGS

02:25:07.932 --> 02:25:09.567
SYSTEM WAS VERY DIFFERENT IN

02:25:09.634 --> 02:25:11.335
TWO THOUSAND SIX THAN IT IS

02:25:11.402 --> 02:25:14.105
TODAY -- OBVIOUSLY THE RULES

02:25:14.172 --> 02:25:15.406
ARE DIFFERENT BUT THERE IS FAR

02:25:15.473 --> 02:25:17.075
MORE CAPACITY ON THE SYSTEM

02:25:17.141 --> 02:25:20.411
THEN AND FURTHERMORE WE HAD --

02:25:20.478 --> 02:25:21.913
AS I INDICATED EARLIER WE HAVE

02:25:21.979 --> 02:25:23.548
ABOUT SEVEN THOUSAND MEGAWATTS

02:25:23.614 --> 02:25:27.018
OF ROOFTOP SOLAR NOW SO IF YOU

02:25:27.085 --> 02:25:29.921
WERE TO COMPARE THE LOAD IN TWO

02:25:29.987 --> 02:25:32.090
THOUSAND SIX WHICH WAS FIFTY

02:25:32.156 --> 02:25:33.691
THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY

02:25:33.758 --> 02:25:36.561
ROUGHLY -- WITH WHAT WE HAD

02:25:36.627 --> 02:25:39.230
RECENTLY YOU HAVE TO NORMALIZE

02:25:39.297 --> 02:25:40.531
IT WOULD BE A FIFTY SEVEN

02:25:40.598 --> 02:25:43.568
THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF LOAD

02:25:43.634 --> 02:25:46.938
IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX SO IF

02:25:47.004 --> 02:25:48.306
YOU KIND OF COMPARE APPLES AND

02:25:48.372 --> 02:25:50.508
APPLES IT WAS IT'S A COMPARABLE

02:25:50.575 --> 02:25:53.444
LOADED -- THAT WE HAD -- THIS

02:25:53.511 --> 02:25:55.780
YEAR AS IN TWO THOUSAND SIX

02:25:55.847 --> 02:25:58.216
AND WHEN YOU WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

02:25:58.282 --> 02:26:00.218
-- ONE IN THIRTY FIVE WE DO

02:26:00.284 --> 02:26:01.652
THINK IT'S A ONE THIRTY FIVE WE

02:26:01.719 --> 02:26:02.620
JUST THINK WE'RE GOING TO GET

02:26:02.687 --> 02:26:04.755
MORE ONE AND THIRTY FIVES AND

02:26:04.822 --> 02:26:05.957
I THINK THAT'S GOT TO BE PART

02:26:06.023 --> 02:26:07.258
OF THE PLANNING GOING FORWARD

02:26:07.325 --> 02:26:10.828
THAT THIS THIS HE NEEDS AND

02:26:10.895 --> 02:26:12.230
THIS CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE

02:26:12.296 --> 02:26:14.799
YOU KNOW IS UPON US AND IT'S

02:26:14.866 --> 02:26:15.867
NOT GONNA BE WON IN THIRTY

02:26:15.933 --> 02:26:17.168
FIVE ANYMORE IT COULD BE THE

02:26:17.235 --> 02:26:18.669
ONE IN FIVE NOW IT COULD BE A

02:26:18.736 --> 02:26:20.771
ONE AND TWO NOW -- AND I THINK

02:26:20.838 --> 02:26:21.572
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PLAN

02:26:21.639 --> 02:26:22.673
FOR THAT AND I THINK THAT'S

02:26:22.740 --> 02:26:23.708
HOW WE GET CLOSE TO MAKING

02:26:23.774 --> 02:26:28.546
SURE WE CAN ASSURE RELIABILITY

02:26:28.613 --> 02:26:31.115
OKAY SIR AB BUT WHAT WHAT

02:26:31.182 --> 02:26:32.183
CHANGED IN CAN OF THE

02:26:32.250 --> 02:26:33.918
MANAGEMENT PROCESS SEES VERSUS

02:26:33.985 --> 02:26:35.486
TWO THOUSAND AND SIX IN TERMS

02:26:35.553 --> 02:26:37.188
OF THE FACT WE WERE ABLE TO

02:26:37.255 --> 02:26:37.955
KEEP THE LIGHTS ON IN TWO

02:26:38.022 --> 02:26:39.690
THOUSAND SIX AND WE WE WEREN'T

02:26:39.757 --> 02:26:42.160
IN AUGUST ACTUALLY THERE WERE

02:26:42.226 --> 02:26:43.427
THERE WERE TWO THINGS I WOULD

02:26:43.494 --> 02:26:44.929
POINT TO THAT WE HAD DIFFERENT

02:26:44.996 --> 02:26:46.264
IN TWO THOUSAND SIX AND WE

02:26:46.330 --> 02:26:48.833
HAVE NOW ONE AS I INDICATED

02:26:48.900 --> 02:26:51.235
WE HAD FAR MORE PASS ME ON THE

02:26:51.302 --> 02:26:54.639
SYSTEM WE HAD -- THE SENATE NO

02:26:54.705 --> 02:26:56.340
FREE NUCLEAR PLANT WHICH IS IN

02:26:56.407 --> 02:26:57.475
TWO THOUSAND MEGAWATTS RIGHT

02:26:57.542 --> 02:27:00.444
THERE -- THEN AND WE HAD --

02:27:00.511 --> 02:27:02.180
PROBABLY SEVERAL THOUSAND NOT

02:27:02.246 --> 02:27:03.948
PROBABLY WE DID HAVE SEVERAL

02:27:04.015 --> 02:27:06.350
THOUSAND MORE MEGAWATTS OF

02:27:06.417 --> 02:27:08.920
GAS PLANTS THAN -- THAN WE

02:27:08.986 --> 02:27:10.988
DO NOW SO THE RISK PASSED THE

02:27:11.055 --> 02:27:13.124
DIFFERENCE THE SECOND ELEMENT

02:27:13.191 --> 02:27:15.059
IS -- THIS AN ELEMENT WE'VE

02:27:15.126 --> 02:27:17.795
BEEN TALKING ABOUT CALIFORNIA

02:27:17.862 --> 02:27:19.697
HEAVILY RELIES ON IMPORTS INTO

02:27:19.764 --> 02:27:21.966
THE STATE TO MEET ITS NEEDS

02:27:22.033 --> 02:27:25.736
AND IT'S BEEN CLEAR TO US THAT

02:27:25.803 --> 02:27:28.806
THAT -- RELIANCE ON IMPORTS IS

02:27:28.873 --> 02:27:30.708
SOMETHING WE NEED TO RETHINK

02:27:30.775 --> 02:27:33.344
BECAUSE THE OTHER AREAS ARE

02:27:33.411 --> 02:27:35.112
FACED WITH THE SAME CHALLENGES

02:27:35.179 --> 02:27:37.248
THAT WE ARE HERE BOTH IN TERMS

02:27:37.315 --> 02:27:39.750
OF LOAD -- AND OTHER CHANGES

02:27:39.817 --> 02:27:43.354
TO THEIR SYSTEM SO THE THERE'S

02:27:43.421 --> 02:27:44.789
BEEN A NUMBER OF RESOURCE

02:27:44.855 --> 02:27:47.058
RETIREMENTS ACROSS THE WEST WE

02:27:47.124 --> 02:27:49.660
IMPORTED IN TWO THOUSAND SIX

02:27:49.727 --> 02:27:50.962
I DON'T KNOW THE EXACT FIGURES

02:27:51.028 --> 02:27:52.296
BUT IF I HAD TO TAKE A STAB

02:27:52.363 --> 02:27:54.265
AT IT WE IMPORTED ON THE ORDER

02:27:54.332 --> 02:27:55.566
OF TWELVE THOUSAND MEGAWATTS

02:27:55.633 --> 02:27:58.169
OF POWER -- OVER THIS HEAT

02:27:58.236 --> 02:28:00.671
WAVE WE ARE THE THE TOP WE HAD

02:28:00.738 --> 02:28:01.939
WAS ABOUT SIXTY FIVE HUNDRED

02:28:02.006 --> 02:28:04.475
MEGAWATT SO ABOUT HALF OF

02:28:04.542 --> 02:28:07.278
WHAT WE HAD TO BE IMPORTED SO

02:28:07.345 --> 02:28:09.247
BETWEEN CAPACITY ON THE SYSTEM

02:28:09.313 --> 02:28:11.249
AND IMPORTS -- THAT COUNTS FOR

02:28:11.315 --> 02:28:13.017
A LOT OF THE DIFFERENCE GOT

02:28:13.084 --> 02:28:15.319
IT OKAY AND THEN LAST QUESTION

02:28:15.386 --> 02:28:17.488
SUIT CAN YOU JUST WALK US

02:28:17.555 --> 02:28:20.558
THROUGH YOUR ATKINS ESCALATION

02:28:20.625 --> 02:28:22.827
PROCESS SEES SO -- YOU KNOW

02:28:22.893 --> 02:28:24.528
WHAT HAPPENS WHO RAISES THE

02:28:24.595 --> 02:28:26.931
ALARM AND SAYS MY GOSH WHAT

02:28:26.998 --> 02:28:28.199
WERE ABOUT TO BE OUT OF POWER

02:28:28.266 --> 02:28:29.300
BECAUSE I THINK ONE THING THAT

02:28:29.367 --> 02:28:32.203
WAS VERY SURPRISING IS IT FELT

02:28:32.270 --> 02:28:33.838
LIKE WE WERE ALL REALLY TAKEN

02:28:33.904 --> 02:28:35.840
BY SURPRISE BY THIS IT WAS

02:28:35.906 --> 02:28:38.075
I THINK IS THE CHAIR SAID WE

02:28:38.142 --> 02:28:39.410
RECEIVED A KIND OF A TWELVE

02:28:39.477 --> 02:28:40.711
HOURS NOTICE OR SOMETHING LIKE

02:28:40.778 --> 02:28:42.580
THAT SO CAN YOU TALK US THROUGH

02:28:42.647 --> 02:28:43.547
WHAT ARE KIND OF THE EARLY

02:28:43.614 --> 02:28:45.783
WARNING SYSTEMS AND ESCALATION

02:28:45.850 --> 02:28:48.552
PROCEDURES FIVE WHEN THE SORT

02:28:48.619 --> 02:28:50.087
OF THING OCCURS ALL BUT I'LL

02:28:50.154 --> 02:28:53.491
TAKE THAT TOO AND -- AS AN

02:28:53.557 --> 02:28:56.127
INSTITUTION -- WILL OWN THAT

02:28:56.193 --> 02:28:57.895
THAT WE SHOULD OF RAISE THE

02:28:57.962 --> 02:29:03.301
ALARM -- -- FASTER BUT -- ALL

02:29:03.367 --> 02:29:04.635
JUST HAVE TO GIVE YOU SOME OF

02:29:04.702 --> 02:29:06.637
MY OWN PERSONAL OBSERVATIONS

02:29:06.704 --> 02:29:09.307
ON THIS WE ARE OFFERING VERY

02:29:09.373 --> 02:29:11.642
CLOSE TO THE EDGE AND I THINK

02:29:11.709 --> 02:29:13.544
WE HAVE A CONTROL ROOM -- WHERE

02:29:13.611 --> 02:29:15.680
THE OPERATORS OPERATE THE GRID

02:29:15.746 --> 02:29:17.181
AND I'VE BEEN DOWN THERE ON

02:29:17.248 --> 02:29:19.684
A NUMBER OF CASES AND TIMES

02:29:19.750 --> 02:29:20.718
WHERE THEY SAID IT'S GOING TO

02:29:20.785 --> 02:29:23.187
BE TIGHT OVER THE PEAK OF HAD

02:29:23.254 --> 02:29:24.522
A CONVERSATION WITH THOSE GREAT

02:29:24.588 --> 02:29:26.324
OPERATORS FIFTY TIMES IT'S

02:29:26.390 --> 02:29:27.992
GONNA BE TIGHT OVER THE P.

02:29:28.059 --> 02:29:30.695
WE KNEW GOING ON THE FOURTEENTH

02:29:30.761 --> 02:29:32.863
THAT WAS GOING TO BE TIGHT

02:29:32.930 --> 02:29:35.333
WHAT WE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND AND

02:29:35.399 --> 02:29:37.868
WE UNDERESTIMATED IS HOW MUCH

02:29:37.935 --> 02:29:40.538
THE PARTICULARLY THE IMPORTANCE

02:29:40.604 --> 02:29:42.306
WORDS AVAILABLE BECAUSE THE

02:29:42.373 --> 02:29:44.909
HEAT WAVE WE HAD WAS A WEST

02:29:44.975 --> 02:29:47.111
WIDE HEAT WAVE IT WAS BRUTAL

02:29:47.178 --> 02:29:49.246
EVERYWHERE IN THE WEST SO WE

02:29:49.313 --> 02:29:52.149
UNDERESTIMATED THE THE LIMITED

02:29:52.216 --> 02:29:54.518
ACCESS OF IMPORTS THAT WE HAD

02:29:54.585 --> 02:29:59.056
AND -- WE WILL BE -- VIGILANT

02:29:59.123 --> 02:30:00.825
AND WE KNOW THAT THAT ISN'T

02:30:00.891 --> 02:30:02.660
THE SITUATION AND I THINK WE

02:30:02.727 --> 02:30:04.662
CORRECTED OURSELVES OVER LABOR

02:30:04.729 --> 02:30:07.298
DAY WEEKEND WE WE TOLD PEOPLE

02:30:07.365 --> 02:30:09.600
VERY EARLY THAT THE CONDITIONS

02:30:09.667 --> 02:30:11.402
ARE GONNA BE TIGHT I WILL NOTE

02:30:11.469 --> 02:30:14.638
THAT WE DID -- ISSUE A FLEXIBLE

02:30:14.705 --> 02:30:17.641
OR ON THURSDAY THE THIRTEENTH

02:30:17.708 --> 02:30:18.976
AND RESTRICTED MAINTENANCE

02:30:19.043 --> 02:30:22.279
-- ORDER ON THE TWELFTH GOING

02:30:22.346 --> 02:30:25.282
INTO THAT NOW THAT DOESN'T MEAN

02:30:25.349 --> 02:30:26.784
THAT YOU KNOW THE POPULACE OF

02:30:26.851 --> 02:30:28.119
THE STATE KNOWS THAT THERE'S

02:30:28.185 --> 02:30:30.287
A RESTRICTED MAINTENANCE THEY

02:30:30.354 --> 02:30:31.389
SHOULD KNOW THERE'S A FLEX

02:30:31.455 --> 02:30:34.258
ALERT HERE TO AFTER UP TO A

02:30:34.325 --> 02:30:35.393
COUPLE YEARS AGO THERE WAS A

02:30:35.459 --> 02:30:39.163
VERY SIGNIFICANT -- ADVERTISING

02:30:39.230 --> 02:30:40.731
CAMPAIGN TO LET PEOPLE KNOW

02:30:40.798 --> 02:30:42.099
ABOUT FLEX ALERTS AND HOW THEY

02:30:42.166 --> 02:30:43.768
WORKED AND THAT FELL BY THE

02:30:43.834 --> 02:30:46.036
WAYSIDE IN ONE OF THE THINGS

02:30:46.103 --> 02:30:48.773
THAT WE HAVE TO ADDRESS IS

02:30:48.839 --> 02:30:50.908
MAKING SURE THAT EVERY CITIZEN

02:30:50.975 --> 02:30:53.344
IN THE STATE IS A WHERE WHEN WE

02:30:53.411 --> 02:30:54.845
HAVE TIGHT CONDITION SO WE'VE

02:30:54.912 --> 02:30:56.347
WE'VE GOT TO RETHINK HOW THE

02:30:56.414 --> 02:30:58.883
SPLIT SOLAR PROCESS WORKS AND

02:30:58.949 --> 02:31:00.551
IT'S A LEARNING FOR US AND I

02:31:00.618 --> 02:31:02.253
CAN ASSURE YOU THAT IT WILL BE

02:31:02.319 --> 02:31:04.789
TOP OF MIND GOT AN ACCESS ONE

02:31:04.855 --> 02:31:05.990
MORE QUESTION BECAUSE THE AND

02:31:06.056 --> 02:31:07.591
SOME ARTICLES THAT I'VE READ

02:31:07.658 --> 02:31:10.594
THERE HAVE BEEN FIVE OBSERVERS

02:31:10.661 --> 02:31:11.762
INCLUDING I THINK A FORMER

02:31:11.829 --> 02:31:13.431
PRESIDENT OF THE P. C.

02:31:13.497 --> 02:31:15.666
HO SPECULATED THAT WE HAVE SOME

02:31:15.733 --> 02:31:18.102
OF THE SAME MARKET MANIPULATION

02:31:18.169 --> 02:31:20.137
OF POTENTIALLY HAPPENING AS WE

02:31:20.204 --> 02:31:22.039
DID IN THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS

02:31:22.106 --> 02:31:24.475
-- ENERGY CRISIS DOESN'T SOUND

02:31:24.542 --> 02:31:26.510
LIKE YOU THINK THAT'S PART

02:31:26.577 --> 02:31:28.179
OF THE ISSUE BUT CAN YOU JUST

02:31:28.245 --> 02:31:30.915
SPEAK TO SPEAK TO THAT CONCERN

02:31:30.981 --> 02:31:32.817
I CAN ALSO DO THAT WE HAVE

02:31:32.883 --> 02:31:35.453
SEEN NO EVIDENCE WHATSOEVER

02:31:35.519 --> 02:31:37.288
OF MANIPULATION DURING THESE

02:31:37.354 --> 02:31:39.857
PERIODS -- AND I KNOW THAT

02:31:39.924 --> 02:31:43.194
A FORMER UC -- PRESIDENT

02:31:43.260 --> 02:31:45.095
SPECULATE ON THAT WITH FRANKLY

02:31:45.162 --> 02:31:47.131
NO BASIS AND I'M NOT EXACTLY

02:31:47.198 --> 02:31:48.432
SURE WHERE THE BASIS CAME

02:31:48.499 --> 02:31:51.335
FROM -- BOTH OR WE HAVE THE

02:31:51.402 --> 02:31:53.270
DEPARTMENT AN INDEPENDENT --

02:31:53.337 --> 02:31:55.739
DEPARTMENT OF MARKET MONITORING

02:31:55.806 --> 02:31:57.374
THEY LOOKED INTO THIS THEY

02:31:57.441 --> 02:31:59.577
AGREE WE HAVE NOT SEEN ANYTHING

02:31:59.643 --> 02:32:01.846
NOW THAT DOESN'T MEAN -- WE'RE

02:32:01.912 --> 02:32:02.980
GONNA PUT OUR GUARDS DOWN

02:32:03.047 --> 02:32:04.114
WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK AT AND

02:32:04.181 --> 02:32:05.249
WE DO NOT SEE ANYTHING AND

02:32:05.316 --> 02:32:08.652
FURTHERMORE THE OUTAGE RATES

02:32:08.719 --> 02:32:11.655
ON THOSE DAYS OF -- GENERATORS

02:32:11.722 --> 02:32:14.558
WAS PROBABLY BELOW NORMAL

02:32:14.625 --> 02:32:16.327
SO WE DIDN'T SEE WITHHOLDING

02:32:16.393 --> 02:32:19.530
OR OTHER MANIPULATION SO --

02:32:19.597 --> 02:32:20.965
THAT'S THAT'S RESPONSE TO

02:32:21.031 --> 02:32:25.369
THE GREAT THANK YOU SO MUCH

02:32:25.436 --> 02:32:27.505
MISTER QUITE CUNNINGHAM

02:32:27.571 --> 02:32:29.440
FEMINIST BURKE THANK YOU

02:32:29.507 --> 02:32:32.810
MISTER CHAIR AMANDA I WANT

02:32:32.877 --> 02:32:33.711
TO THANK EVERYBODY FOR BEING

02:32:33.777 --> 02:32:34.879
HERE I'D LIKE TO SUGGEST

02:32:34.945 --> 02:32:36.213
ACTUALLY OUR SITUATION WITH

02:32:36.280 --> 02:32:38.082
CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY GRID

02:32:38.148 --> 02:32:39.750
IT'S A LOT WORSE AND WE'RE

02:32:39.817 --> 02:32:42.219
CONTEMPLATING TODAY WE ARE

02:32:42.286 --> 02:32:44.755
SEEING THE RETIREMENT ASSETS

02:32:44.822 --> 02:32:46.557
WHETHER THEY BE NATURAL GAS OR

02:32:46.624 --> 02:32:48.459
THE IMPENDING DECOMMISSIONING

02:32:48.526 --> 02:32:49.894
OF THE DIABLO CANYON NUCLEAR

02:32:49.960 --> 02:32:51.829
POWER PLANT JAPANESE TO BE

02:32:51.896 --> 02:32:53.163
IN MY DISTRICT WHICH PRODUCES

02:32:53.230 --> 02:32:54.465
NINE PERCENT ROUGHLY THE

02:32:54.532 --> 02:32:57.568
STATE'S ENERGY CARBON FREE IN

02:32:57.635 --> 02:32:58.802
MY OPINION THAT'S A FOOLISH

02:32:58.869 --> 02:33:00.337
DECISION BUT IT'S BEEN MADE

02:33:00.404 --> 02:33:02.773
AND WE'RE ADAPTING TO IT THE

02:33:02.840 --> 02:33:03.874
QUESTION IS ARE WE PLANNING

02:33:03.941 --> 02:33:06.610
FOR IT I THINK THE ANSWER'S

02:33:06.677 --> 02:33:10.214
NO WE HAVE NO PLAN REALLY

02:33:10.281 --> 02:33:11.348
WE'VE WRITTEN IN THE LAWS THAT

02:33:11.415 --> 02:33:13.851
WE HAVE TO ACHIEVE GOALS --

02:33:13.918 --> 02:33:15.419
DECARBONIZING OUR ELECTRICITY

02:33:15.486 --> 02:33:16.687
GRIDS ABSOLUTELY THE RIGHT

02:33:16.754 --> 02:33:18.589
THING FOR THE ENVIRONMENT FOR

02:33:18.656 --> 02:33:21.525
CLIMATE CHANGE FOR CONSTITUENTS

02:33:21.592 --> 02:33:23.294
BUT YOU NEED A PLAN TO TO TO

02:33:23.360 --> 02:33:26.096
EXECUTE THAT YOU NEED TO FIGURE

02:33:26.163 --> 02:33:27.398
OUT HOW TO REPLACE THE RETIRED

02:33:27.464 --> 02:33:29.300
ASSETS REPLACE DOUBLE CANYON'S

02:33:29.366 --> 02:33:31.936
POWER THE FUTURE IS ALSO GONNA

02:33:32.002 --> 02:33:33.203
INVOLVE A LOT MORE DEMAND ON

02:33:33.270 --> 02:33:35.306
OUR ELECTRICITY GRID WE'RE

02:33:35.372 --> 02:33:36.340
BUILDING MORE HOUSING THAT'S

02:33:36.407 --> 02:33:38.976
MORE AC UNITS MORE LECTERNS

02:33:39.043 --> 02:33:41.211
IT'S GETTING HOTTER EVERY YEAR

02:33:41.278 --> 02:33:43.514
A LOT HOTTER THAT'S MORE AC

02:33:43.581 --> 02:33:45.449
MORE ELECTRONS WE'RE GOING TO

02:33:45.516 --> 02:33:47.918
CLOUD COMPUTING FIVE G.

02:33:47.985 --> 02:33:50.921
THAT'S MORE ELECTRONS WE'RE

02:33:50.988 --> 02:33:52.323
GOING TO SEE A REVOLUTION

02:33:52.389 --> 02:33:54.258
ELECTRIC VEHICLES THAT'S A

02:33:54.325 --> 02:33:56.427
LOT MORE ELECTRONS ALL THIS

02:33:56.493 --> 02:33:57.394
IS HAPPENING OVER THE NEXT

02:33:57.461 --> 02:33:59.229
DECADE WE'RE PRETENDING THIS

02:33:59.296 --> 02:34:01.966
IS A STATIC EQUATION NOT

02:34:02.032 --> 02:34:03.534
DEMANDS GOING UP GOING UP

02:34:03.601 --> 02:34:06.604
A LOT WE'RE LOSING SUPPLY

02:34:06.670 --> 02:34:08.005
WIND AND SOLAR GREAT THEY'RE

02:34:08.072 --> 02:34:09.340
FANTASTIC THEY'RE ALSO

02:34:09.406 --> 02:34:11.575
INTERMITTENT SOARED PRODUCES

02:34:11.642 --> 02:34:14.545
ZERO IN A STARK WIND GOES UP

02:34:14.612 --> 02:34:16.614
AND DOWN SO YOU GOT A PAIR

02:34:16.680 --> 02:34:17.982
THAT WITH STORAGE AS SOME OF

02:34:18.048 --> 02:34:20.651
MY COLLEAGUES HAVE POINTED OUT

02:34:20.718 --> 02:34:22.419
WIDESCALE WIDESPREAD PUMPED

02:34:22.486 --> 02:34:24.455
STORAGE BATTERY STORES DOESN'T

02:34:24.521 --> 02:34:25.623
WORK THERE ISN'T ENOUGH WITH

02:34:25.689 --> 02:34:26.957
WITH THEM IN THE WORLD TO DO IT

02:34:27.024 --> 02:34:29.827
THAT WAY THESE ARE FACTS FOLKS

02:34:29.893 --> 02:34:33.397
THESE ARE FACTS THIS IS SCIENCE

02:34:33.464 --> 02:34:35.933
WE NEED A PLAN TWENTY EIGHTEEN

02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:36.934
ME AND SENATOR MONNING WITH

02:34:37.001 --> 02:34:38.035
A LOT OF HELP FROM PEOPLE IN

02:34:38.102 --> 02:34:39.370
THIS ROOM PASSED THE BILL SB

02:34:39.436 --> 02:34:41.338
TO NINETY TO MITIGATE SOME

02:34:41.405 --> 02:34:42.973
OF THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THE

02:34:43.040 --> 02:34:45.509
DIABLO CANYON CLOSURE AND IN

02:34:45.576 --> 02:34:47.011
THAT BILL IT REQUIRED A PLAN

02:34:47.077 --> 02:34:49.313
FOR THE PC TO REPLACE THE NINE

02:34:49.380 --> 02:34:50.147
PERCENT THAT WE'RE GOING TO

02:34:50.214 --> 02:34:51.749
LOSE FROM DIABLO WHEN IS THE

02:34:51.815 --> 02:34:54.018
COMMISSION TWENTY TWENTY FIVE

02:34:54.084 --> 02:34:56.553
WITH GHG EMISSION FREE ENERGY

02:34:56.620 --> 02:34:58.622
PRODUCTION WE SEE NOTHING ELSE

02:34:58.689 --> 02:35:01.325
TWO YEARS AGO WE SEE NOTHING

02:35:01.392 --> 02:35:02.393
I'VE BEEN TRYING FOR A YEAR

GET A TARGET SET BY THE QC FOR

02:35:05.696 --> 02:35:07.898
OFFSHORE WIND PRODUCTION BEEN

02:35:07.965 --> 02:35:08.899
BEATING MY HEAD INTO THE WALL

02:35:08.966 --> 02:35:11.635
MOSTLY FOR YEARS THE PC'S BEEN

02:35:11.702 --> 02:35:13.270
SAYING WE'RE GONNA GET TO THAT

02:35:13.337 --> 02:35:14.238
WE'VE GOT SOMETHING COMING

OUT HAVEN'T SEEN A THING OTHER

02:35:17.408 --> 02:35:18.709
COUNTRIES ARE SOLVING PROBLEMS

02:35:18.776 --> 02:35:21.545
PORTUGAL IRELAND VIRGINIA RHODE

02:35:21.612 --> 02:35:23.147
ISLAND STATES ON THE EAST COAST

02:35:23.213 --> 02:35:25.149
OFFSHORE WIND YOU COULD DO

02:35:25.215 --> 02:35:28.152
TWO GIGAWATTS HE SAID ENOUGH

02:35:28.218 --> 02:35:33.157
OFFER WHEN WHAT'S OUR PLAN

OFFSHORE WIND PRODUCTION AND

02:35:59.550 --> 02:36:01.952
FINALLY WIDESPREAD PUMP STORAGE

02:36:02.019 --> 02:36:03.253
IS THERE A PUMPED STORAGE

02:36:03.320 --> 02:36:05.055
PROJECT THAT CAN COME ONLINE IN

02:36:05.122 --> 02:36:07.057

HAVE A PLAN FOR ON THE NINE

02:36:22.906 --> 02:36:25.109
PERCENT THAT'S FALLING OFF FROM

02:36:25.175 --> 02:36:26.577
THE DIABLO CANYON GENERATING

02:36:26.643 --> 02:36:29.613

THE SCALE FOR THE RESOURCE THE

02:38:09.313 --> 02:38:11.515
WIND RESOURCE IS SUBSTANTIALLY

02:38:11.582 --> 02:38:13.650
BETTER OFF SHORE IN CALIFORNIA

02:38:13.717 --> 02:38:15.552
IT'S APPROACHING SIXTY PERCENT

02:38:15.619 --> 02:38:17.254
CAPACITY FACTORS OF THE

02:38:17.321 --> 02:38:18.355
TURBINES ARE SPENDING SIXTY

02:38:18.422 --> 02:38:19.523
PERCENT THE HOURS OF THE DAY

02:38:19.590 --> 02:38:22.459
IN WAYS THAT COMPLEMENT SOLAR

AS COMPARED TO WIND ON LANDS

02:38:28.365 --> 02:38:29.299
ABOUT THIRTY FIVE PERCENT

02:38:29.366 --> 02:38:31.134
CAPACITY FACTOR SO WE'RE

02:38:31.201 --> 02:38:32.669
WORKING ON THAT WE DO NEED TO

02:38:32.736 --> 02:38:34.071
BE ABLE TO COOPERATE WITH THE

02:39:42.339 --> 02:39:43.440
HOW YOU'VE BEEN PLANNING AND

02:39:43.507 --> 02:39:45.008
IT'S EVERY TWO EVEN PLANNING

02:39:45.075 --> 02:39:46.576
BASED ON EVERY TWO YEARS AND I

02:39:46.643 --> 02:39:47.811
THINK THAT THERE'S SOME CONCERN

02:39:47.878 --> 02:39:49.446
THAT THAT IT'S NOT GONNA WORK

02:39:49.513 --> 02:39:51.982
ANYMORE AND THAT THE FACT THAT

02:39:52.049 --> 02:39:53.884
GLOBAL WARMING IS GLOBAL AND

02:39:53.951 --> 02:39:55.218
LIKE THAT WAS JUST SAID THAT

02:39:55.285 --> 02:39:56.920
WE HAD A WEST COAST EVENT

02:39:56.987 --> 02:39:58.388
OBVIOUSLY THAT OCCURRED AND WE

02:39:58.455 --> 02:40:01.058
LOST IN THE FIGHT FOR ELECTRONS

02:40:01.124 --> 02:40:02.359
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA LOSS

02:40:02.426 --> 02:40:03.727
BECAUSE WE HAVE RELIED ON THE

02:40:03.794 --> 02:40:05.796
IMPORT OF THAT YOU KNOW I DO

02:40:05.862 --> 02:40:07.230
BELIEVE THAT WE CAN RESPECT

02:40:07.297 --> 02:40:09.166
OUR GOALS I RESPECT WE CAN BE

02:40:09.232 --> 02:40:10.734
THOUGHT FOR THE TRANSITION I

02:40:10.801 --> 02:40:12.102
JUST I'M NOT SURE THAT WE BEEN

02:40:12.169 --> 02:40:13.737
HONEST OF WHAT THAT TRANSITION

02:40:13.804 --> 02:40:16.406
ACTUALLY NEEDS TO LOOK LIKE AND

02:40:16.473 --> 02:40:18.041
I WILL SAY THAT THAT IS PARTLY

02:40:18.108 --> 02:40:19.376
NOT JUST I THINK WE'RE PUTTING

02:40:19.443 --> 02:40:21.144
A LOT OF IT ON YOU AND CAL I

02:40:21.211 --> 02:40:22.446
STILL BUT I DO THINK IT'S PART

02:40:22.512 --> 02:40:23.880
THE LEGISLATURE FOR POSSIBILITY

02:40:23.947 --> 02:40:26.450
AS WELL AND IN SAYING THAT

02:40:26.516 --> 02:40:27.751
I I JUST BECAUSE THEY DON'T

02:40:27.818 --> 02:40:28.452
BELIEVE THAT WOULD BE HAVE

02:40:28.518 --> 02:40:29.419
BEEN HONEST WITH SOME OF OUR

02:40:29.486 --> 02:40:32.522
ENVIRONMENTALISTS PARTNERS I

02:40:32.589 --> 02:40:33.957
THINK WE'VE TOLD THEM THAT WE

02:40:34.024 --> 02:40:35.392
HAVE THESE LOFTY GOALS AND I

02:40:35.459 --> 02:40:36.526
THINK WE CAN REACH AND I THINK

02:40:36.593 --> 02:40:37.694
WE CAN BE A GOOD EXAMPLE BUT

02:40:37.761 --> 02:40:38.528
I DON'T KNOW THAT WE'VE BEEN

02:40:38.595 --> 02:40:40.263
HONEST ABOUT WHAT HAS TO HAPPEN

02:40:40.330 --> 02:40:43.033
BETWEEN HERE AND THERE AND I

02:40:43.100 --> 02:40:44.267
KEEP HEARING A LOT OF WORDS

02:40:44.334 --> 02:40:45.469
AND I THINK LIKE MY COLLEAGUES

02:40:45.535 --> 02:40:47.004
MENTIONED LIKE PLANNING AND

02:40:47.070 --> 02:40:48.739
IN THE FUTURE TECHNOLOGY AND

02:40:48.805 --> 02:40:50.140
WE ARE PLANNING FOR THESE

02:40:50.207 --> 02:40:52.309
THINGS BUT IF WE HAD AN ANOTHER

02:40:52.376 --> 02:40:54.478
EVENT TOMORROW FOR THE NEXT

02:40:54.544 --> 02:40:56.613
WEEK WE WOULD FAIL AGAIN AND

02:40:56.680 --> 02:40:57.748
I HAVEN'T REALLY HEARD HOW

02:40:57.814 --> 02:40:59.716
WE WOULDN'T FAIL AGAIN SO I

02:40:59.783 --> 02:41:01.518
HAVE TWO QUESTIONS AS SOMEONE

02:41:01.585 --> 02:41:03.920
WHO'S WILLING TO TAKE AND TAKE

02:41:03.987 --> 02:41:05.155
ON THE RESPONSIBILITY WITH

02:41:05.222 --> 02:41:06.256
MY COLLEAGUES IS ACCEPTING

02:41:06.323 --> 02:41:07.257
THAT PART OF THIS IS OUR

02:41:07.324 --> 02:41:09.626
RESPONSIBILITY ONE IS IN YOUR

02:41:09.693 --> 02:41:12.262
RESOURCE ADEQUACY PLANS THAT

02:41:12.329 --> 02:41:13.897
YOU ARE MAKING ADJUSTMENTS WERE

02:41:13.964 --> 02:41:15.298
BECAUSE PEAK IS NOT THE SAME

02:41:15.365 --> 02:41:16.700
I MEAN I LIVE IN LOS ANGELES

02:41:16.767 --> 02:41:18.635
WHERE IT AT TWELVE O'CLOCK

02:41:18.702 --> 02:41:20.670
IT'S THE HOTTEST OF DOUBT

02:41:20.737 --> 02:41:22.005
THAT I WORK IN SACRAMENTO I'VE

02:41:22.072 --> 02:41:23.106
LEARNED THAT FOUR O'CLOCK IT'S

02:41:23.173 --> 02:41:24.307
A HUNDRED AND FOUR DEGREES

02:41:24.374 --> 02:41:26.777
OUTSIDE IN MY LA HOME I

02:41:26.843 --> 02:41:28.245
DON'T HAVE AIR CONDITIONING I

02:41:28.311 --> 02:41:30.380
DON'T NEED IT UP HERE CENTRAL

02:41:30.447 --> 02:41:32.015
VALLEY ALL THIS AND I'VE WORN

02:41:32.082 --> 02:41:33.016
THESE THINGS THAT I DIDN'T

02:41:33.083 --> 02:41:35.318
KNOW BEFORE AND I'M CURIOUS

02:41:35.385 --> 02:41:36.453
I KNOW YOU'RE IN THE PROCESS

02:41:36.520 --> 02:41:37.587
OF ADJUSTING THAT RESOURCE

02:41:37.654 --> 02:41:39.656
ADEQUACY PROCESS AND PLAN IN

02:41:39.723 --> 02:41:41.491
THE MARGINS MY QUESTION FIRST

02:41:41.558 --> 02:41:43.493
QUESTION WOULD BE ONE DO WE

02:41:43.560 --> 02:41:44.828
NEED TO LEGISLATE TO PUT A

02:41:44.895 --> 02:41:47.264
DEADLINE ON THAT PROCESS IS

02:41:47.330 --> 02:41:48.365
THAT WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO

02:41:48.432 --> 02:41:49.933
MAKE SWORE THAT THAT IS DONE

02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:51.601
IN A TIMELY FASHION I KNOW

02:41:51.668 --> 02:41:52.869
YOU'RE IN THE PROCESS OF IT BUT

02:41:52.936 --> 02:41:55.038
I'M CURIOUS IS THAT NECESSARY

02:41:55.105 --> 02:41:56.306
AND THEN MY SECOND QUESTION

02:41:56.373 --> 02:41:59.342
IS BATTERY STORAGE OBVIOUSLY

02:41:59.409 --> 02:42:00.477
LITHIUM BATTERIES AREN'T

02:42:00.544 --> 02:42:02.746
LONG ENOUGH OBVIOUSLY WE NEED

02:42:02.813 --> 02:42:04.381
SEASONAL STORAGE BUT THAT IS

02:42:04.448 --> 02:42:06.817
NOT INTO TALLADEGA NOT IN THE

02:42:06.883 --> 02:42:08.685
ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS IS THAT A

02:42:08.752 --> 02:42:09.953
TOTAL PLAN I THINK WE'VE ALL

02:42:10.020 --> 02:42:11.388
AGREED -- WE ALL UNDERSTAND NOW

02:42:11.455 --> 02:42:12.622
THE BATTERY STORAGE ISN'T THE

02:42:12.689 --> 02:42:15.158
GOLDEN EGG THAT WE HAD HOPED

02:42:15.225 --> 02:42:17.294
IT WAS GOING TO BE YOU KNOW

02:42:17.360 --> 02:42:18.929
WHERE DO MICRO GRADES FALL INTO

02:42:18.995 --> 02:42:19.930
THAT I KNOW THAT YOU'RE IN THE

02:42:19.996 --> 02:42:21.565
PROCESS OF PROCEEDING DO WE

02:42:21.631 --> 02:42:23.100
NEED TO LEGISLATORS TO WIN THAT

02:42:23.166 --> 02:42:24.534
OR WE ALREADY HAVE LEGISLATORS

02:42:24.601 --> 02:42:25.602
TO WIN AT THAT PROCEEDING

02:42:25.669 --> 02:42:27.838
SHOULD BE DONE I APPRECIATE

02:42:27.904 --> 02:42:29.239
AGAIN PRESIDENT BADGER THAT

02:42:29.306 --> 02:42:31.108
THAT HAS MOVED FASTER SINCE

02:42:31.174 --> 02:42:32.909
YOU'VE BEEN THERE BUT HOW DO

02:42:32.976 --> 02:42:34.544
WE MAKE SURE THESE THINGS AS A

02:42:34.611 --> 02:42:36.847
LEGISLATURE HOW DO WE WILL LINE

02:42:36.913 --> 02:42:38.181
COMMUNICATE HONESTLY WHAT THE

02:42:38.248 --> 02:42:39.783
TRANSITION REALLY DOES GONNA

02:42:39.850 --> 02:42:41.051
IS GONNA LOOK LIKE AND WHAT DO

02:42:41.118 --> 02:42:42.419
YOU NEED FROM US TO MAKE THAT

02:42:42.486 --> 02:42:43.820
CLEAR TO PEOPLE AND TO GIVE

02:42:43.887 --> 02:42:45.355
YOU THE TOOLS YOU NEED TO MAKE

02:42:45.422 --> 02:42:47.090
THIS GREAT TRANSITION TO THIS

02:42:47.157 --> 02:42:49.759
CARBON FREE ENVIRONMENT AND

02:42:49.826 --> 02:42:52.863
TO DOES IT HELP YOU OR DO WE

02:42:52.929 --> 02:42:54.498
NEED TO LEGISLATE ON WHAT THOSE

02:42:54.564 --> 02:42:55.932
DEADLINE LOOK LIKE TO MAKE SURE

02:42:55.999 --> 02:42:57.968
THEY ARE RECEIVED BECAUSE TO ME

02:42:58.034 --> 02:42:59.603
I WILL SAY I WAS NOT SURPRISED

02:42:59.669 --> 02:43:01.171
AT WHAT HAPPENED BECAUSE CAO

02:43:01.238 --> 02:43:02.639
AYE SO CAME TO ME A YEAR AGO

02:43:02.706 --> 02:43:03.840
AND SAID THIS IS ON IT'S ON THE

02:43:03.907 --> 02:43:05.942
HORIZON SO I KNOW I'M PRETTY

02:43:06.009 --> 02:43:08.445
LOW ON THE TOTEM POLE IF I IF

02:43:08.512 --> 02:43:09.913
SOMEONE CAME TO ME THEY CAME

02:43:09.980 --> 02:43:12.249
TO EVERYBODY ELSE LONG BEFORE

02:43:12.315 --> 02:43:14.851
THEY CAME TO ME SO I FIND IT

02:43:14.918 --> 02:43:17.053
FRUSTRATING THAT WE HIT THAT

02:43:17.120 --> 02:43:19.389
WE HIT THAT FEW DAYS BECAUSE

02:43:19.456 --> 02:43:21.591
IF I KNEW IT WAS ON THE HORIZON

02:43:21.658 --> 02:43:23.093
EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN THIS

02:43:23.160 --> 02:43:24.761
ROOM INCLUDING YOU GUYS KNEW

WILLING TO TAKE ON PART OF OUR

02:43:28.198 --> 02:43:29.299
RESPONSIBILITY BUT I NEED TO

02:43:29.366 --> 02:43:32.602
KNOW WHAT IT NEEDS TO LOOK LIKE

02:43:32.669 --> 02:43:34.938
THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE --

-- THE I DON'T BELIEVE WE

02:43:43.880 --> 02:43:45.749
NEED TIME FRAMES WE ARE OUR

02:43:45.815 --> 02:43:47.551
RESOURCE ADEQUACY NOT WHAT

02:43:47.617 --> 02:43:50.453
THE DECISION IS ON GOING OUR

02:43:50.520 --> 02:43:55.358
OUR ON EXPEDITED -- PROCEEDING

02:43:55.425 --> 02:43:57.460
-- IS UNDER WAY AS I SAID

02:43:57.527 --> 02:43:59.729
RESEARCH ADVOCACY DECISIONS

02:43:59.796 --> 02:44:01.164
THIS THIS PHASE THIS ROUND

02:44:01.231 --> 02:44:03.967
WILL BE DONE IN BY JUNE AND

THAT WILL INCLUDE AN EXTENDED

02:44:09.039 --> 02:44:10.674
NO WE WILL BE LOOKING AT THE

02:44:10.740 --> 02:44:14.711

GOSH I LOST MY TRAIN OF

02:44:22.819 --> 02:44:24.387
THOUGHT WHAT MY SECOND POINT

02:44:24.454 --> 02:44:27.257
IS -- YOUR SECOND QUESTION I'M

02:44:27.324 --> 02:44:30.894
SORRY REYES WERE PART OF THE

02:44:30.961 --> 02:44:32.762
OVERALL PICTURE WHAT NEEDED TO

02:44:32.829 --> 02:44:34.364
HOW DO WE NEED TO LEGISLATIVE

02:44:34.431 --> 02:44:35.599
OR WE'VE ALREADY LEGISLATED

02:44:35.665 --> 02:44:36.866
ON WHEN THAT SHOULD BE DONE

02:44:36.933 --> 02:44:38.835
BUT WHAT IS NOT LOOKING LIKE

02:44:38.902 --> 02:44:41.238
ARE WE WE WE -- EXPEDITED

02:44:41.304 --> 02:44:43.573
THAT PROCEEDING -- MY FELLOW

02:44:43.640 --> 02:44:44.407
COMMISSIONER COMMISSIONER

02:44:44.474 --> 02:44:47.377
SURE ROMA STARTED PHASE --

02:44:47.444 --> 02:44:49.579
ONE OF THAT AND WE SCULPTED

02:44:49.646 --> 02:44:51.081
ACTUALLY IN DECEMBER AND IT WAS

02:44:51.147 --> 02:44:55.018
FINALIZED IN JUNE -- FOR THIS

02:44:55.085 --> 02:44:57.320
YEAR FOR THIS COMING YEAR AND

02:44:57.387 --> 02:44:58.688
SHE IS NOW UNDERTAKING PHASE

02:44:58.755 --> 02:45:00.490
TWO WHICH WILL BE FINALIZED ME

02:45:00.557 --> 02:45:02.259
BEFORE -- THE END OF THE YEAR

02:45:02.325 --> 02:45:03.994
BY DECEMBER ON MICHAEL IT'S

02:45:04.060 --> 02:45:05.195
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS VERY

02:45:05.262 --> 02:45:07.497
DIFFICULT FOR US THE PHASE ONE

02:45:07.564 --> 02:45:10.533
OF THE MICROGRID WAS FOR THIS

02:45:10.600 --> 02:45:13.703
COMING IT PERIOD OF TIME SOME

02:45:13.770 --> 02:45:15.238
OF THE MIX WHICH WAS MENTIONED

02:45:15.305 --> 02:45:18.208
EARLIER WAS FRANKLY DIESEL THAT

02:45:18.275 --> 02:45:19.609
WAS PUT INTO THE MY COULD GET

02:45:19.676 --> 02:45:23.380
THAT WHERE WERE -- WORKING HARD

02:45:23.446 --> 02:45:25.982
WITH THE LSE'S AND OTHERS TO

02:45:26.049 --> 02:45:28.618
ENSURE THAT THAT IS REPLACED

02:45:28.685 --> 02:45:31.988
BY -- CLEAN ENERGY AND -- IT

02:45:32.055 --> 02:45:33.890
WAS A TIME FACTOR UNFORTUNATELY

02:45:33.957 --> 02:45:35.959
THIS YEAR BUT THOSE BOTH THOSE

02:45:36.026 --> 02:45:37.494
PROCEEDINGS WERE EXPEDITED

02:45:37.560 --> 02:45:39.896
DONE WITHIN A SIX MONTH PERIOD

02:45:39.963 --> 02:45:41.431
AND THAT WILL CONTINUE TO TO

02:45:41.498 --> 02:45:44.334
COMPLETION RIGHT YES YES --

02:45:44.401 --> 02:45:45.802
AND THEN MY LAST QUESTION IS

02:45:45.869 --> 02:45:46.936
I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE THESE

02:45:47.003 --> 02:45:49.339
RESOURCES COMING ONLINE --

02:45:49.406 --> 02:45:51.574
I IT THOSE SEEM LIKE ENOUGH

02:45:51.641 --> 02:45:53.810
FOR NEXT YEAR I JUST WHAT I'M

02:45:53.877 --> 02:45:55.245
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IS HOW

02:45:55.312 --> 02:45:56.146
I KNOW YOU SAID THAT THERE'S

02:45:56.212 --> 02:45:58.348
PLANNING TO GO TO TWO AND FIVE

02:45:58.415 --> 02:46:00.684
YEARS TWO AND FIVE YEAR OUT

02:46:00.750 --> 02:46:02.285
BUT THAT WAS BASED ON I BELIEVE

02:46:02.352 --> 02:46:03.486
WITH THE JOHN THE MINISTER SAID

02:46:03.553 --> 02:46:05.422
WAS A ON THIS TRADITION OF OF

02:46:05.488 --> 02:46:08.024
REVIEWING THE LAST TWO YEARS

02:46:08.091 --> 02:46:11.127
-- I GREW UP WHAT WE WOULD NEED

02:46:11.194 --> 02:46:13.029
SO LOOKING FORWARD IS THERE

02:46:13.096 --> 02:46:15.031
A TOTALITY THE TOTALITARIAN

02:46:15.098 --> 02:46:17.267
SOMEWHERE LOOK AT ALL OF THESE

02:46:17.334 --> 02:46:19.002
DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE ASSEMBLY

02:46:19.069 --> 02:46:21.404
MEMBER CUNNINGHAM MENTIONED

02:46:21.471 --> 02:46:22.405
THAT WE HAVE YOU KNOW LIKE

02:46:22.472 --> 02:46:23.973
THE CARS COMING ONLINE THAT WE

02:46:24.040 --> 02:46:26.242
HAVE THESE LARGE OBVIOUSLY WILL

02:46:26.309 --> 02:46:28.011
EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS WHICH I

02:46:28.078 --> 02:46:30.080
THINK ARE JUST NEW WHETHER NEW

02:46:30.146 --> 02:46:32.849
SUMMERS EARLIER LONGER SUMMERS

02:46:32.916 --> 02:46:35.151
-- HOW WHAT DOES IT ACTUALLY

02:46:35.218 --> 02:46:36.820
LOOK LIKE HOW DOES THAT PROCESS

02:46:36.886 --> 02:46:38.021
WHAT DOES THAT PROCESS LOOK

02:46:38.088 --> 02:46:39.522
LIKE DIFFERENT THAN IT WILL

02:46:39.589 --> 02:46:40.824
LOOK LIKE BEFORE THAT PLANNING

02:46:40.890 --> 02:46:42.459
PROCESS BECAUSE I'M LISTENING

02:46:42.525 --> 02:46:43.493
TO WHAT THE GENTLEMAN SAID

02:46:43.560 --> 02:46:44.527
AND SOUNDED LIKE THEY WERE

02:46:44.594 --> 02:46:45.929
CONTINUING TO DO WHAT THEY'VE

02:46:45.995 --> 02:46:48.131
BEEN DOING IN THE FORECASTING

02:46:48.198 --> 02:46:50.934
YES -- DO YOU WANT TO ADDRESS

02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:52.836
THAT DAY YES SO WHEN WE WE DO

02:46:52.902 --> 02:46:55.305
THE WE DO A ONE INTO FORECAST

02:46:55.372 --> 02:46:56.873
ONE OF FIVE FORECAST ONE TEN

02:46:56.940 --> 02:46:58.475
FOR THOSE ARE ALREADY ON GOING

02:46:58.541 --> 02:47:00.076
THAT THE CHOICE WHICH TO USE

02:47:00.143 --> 02:47:02.212
IS NOT IS NOT ARE WE I THINK

02:47:02.278 --> 02:47:05.715
THAT THE THE -- YOU'RE RIGHT

02:47:05.782 --> 02:47:08.718
THAT WHAT HAS HAPPENED IS THE

02:47:08.785 --> 02:47:09.819
CLIMATE IS CHANGING WE'RE GOING

02:47:09.886 --> 02:47:11.254
TO HAVE YOU KNOW THE EVENTS

02:47:11.321 --> 02:47:12.756
THAT USED TO BE ONE THIRTY FIVE

02:47:12.822 --> 02:47:13.990
THAT ARE MORE FREQUENT I THINK

02:47:14.057 --> 02:47:15.859
THAT'S YOUR ALL CALIBER THAT

02:47:15.925 --> 02:47:18.461
BUT WE'RE ALSO -- STEVEN WONDER

02:47:18.528 --> 02:47:19.796
IF YOU COULD COMMENT ON THE

02:47:19.863 --> 02:47:21.431
HIGH ELECTRIFICATION FORECAST

02:47:21.498 --> 02:47:22.699
BECAUSE WE ARE WE HAVE A

02:47:22.766 --> 02:47:25.135
SCENARIO WE RUN WHERE WE'RE YOU

02:47:25.201 --> 02:47:27.103
KNOW WHICH INCLUDES ALL OF THE

02:47:27.170 --> 02:47:28.338
THINGS AS SOMEONE CUNNINGHAM

02:47:28.405 --> 02:47:29.606
WAS MENTIONING INCLUDING RECTOR

02:47:29.672 --> 02:47:32.742
KEUCHEL'S SILVA COULD YOU JUST

IN THAT THE -- CHICO SHIELD

02:47:42.285 --> 02:47:44.287
IS TALKING ABOUT IS AND THE

02:47:44.354 --> 02:47:46.089
THIRD PLANNING HORIZON WE HAVE

02:47:46.156 --> 02:47:48.124
WHICH IS THE SB ONE HUNDRED

02:47:48.191 --> 02:47:49.959
WHICH IS THE TWENTY FORTY FIVE

02:47:50.026 --> 02:47:51.461
-- WORK THAT THE T.

02:47:51.528 --> 02:47:52.929
AGENCIES ARE CURRENTLY WORKING

02:47:52.996 --> 02:47:55.198
ON -- INCLUDING THAT EIGHT

02:47:55.265 --> 02:47:57.333
RESOURCES BOARD I'M TO THE

02:47:57.400 --> 02:47:58.935
DEMAND SCENARIOS THAT WE

02:47:59.002 --> 02:48:02.338
CURRENTLY -- USE TO PLAN

02:48:02.405 --> 02:48:03.640
THE GOOD FOR TWENTY FORTY

02:48:03.706 --> 02:48:05.708
FIVE I JUST CALLED THE HIGH

02:48:05.775 --> 02:48:07.644
ELECTRIFICATION SCENARIO

02:48:07.710 --> 02:48:09.212
AND WITHIN THAT SCENARIO

02:48:09.279 --> 02:48:12.348
-- WE ACTUALLY ASSUME THAT

02:48:12.415 --> 02:48:14.717
A HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE

02:48:14.784 --> 02:48:16.619
LIGHT DUTY VEHICLES WILL BE

02:48:16.686 --> 02:48:17.887
ELECTRIC BY TWENTY THIRTY

02:48:17.954 --> 02:48:19.088
FIVE THAT WAS PRIOR TO THE

02:48:19.155 --> 02:48:21.691
EXECUTIVE ORDER WAS SIGNED

02:48:21.758 --> 02:48:22.959
I'M SO SO THAT'S KIND OF

02:48:23.026 --> 02:48:24.427
IN LINE WITH -- WITH WHAT

02:48:24.494 --> 02:48:27.630
SOME OF THE AT THE GUINNESS

02:48:27.697 --> 02:48:29.833
AND IN THAT PROJECTION IS A

02:48:29.899 --> 02:48:32.202
PROJECTING -- AS IF WE ALL

02:48:32.268 --> 02:48:34.070
GO BACK TO LIKE I I'LL HOW DO

02:48:34.137 --> 02:48:35.338
YOU PROJECT FOR LIKE ALL THESE

02:48:35.405 --> 02:48:36.606
LIFE CHANGES RIGHT LIKE NOW

02:48:36.673 --> 02:48:37.907
WE HAVE COLLUDED WILL STAY AT

02:48:37.974 --> 02:48:40.176
HOME I ASSUME THAT HAS SOME

02:48:40.243 --> 02:48:42.212
ISSUE SOME BALANCE ON WHY WE

02:48:42.278 --> 02:48:43.346
LOST ELECTRICITY EVERYONE'S

02:48:43.413 --> 02:48:44.547
IN THEIR HOUSE AND IT YOU KNOW

02:48:44.614 --> 02:48:45.548
WITH THEIR CONDITIONING ON ON

02:48:45.615 --> 02:48:47.617
THEIR OFFICE BUILDINGS HOW DID

02:48:47.684 --> 02:48:49.285
THOSE PROJECTIONS WORK FOR THAN

02:48:49.352 --> 02:48:51.488
FOR A AND ARE THERE TO LEVELS

02:48:51.554 --> 02:48:52.956
OF PROJECTIONS ONE FOUR IF

02:48:53.022 --> 02:48:54.357
WORKING LIFE IS CHANGING PEOPLE

02:48:54.424 --> 02:48:55.658
ARE CHARGING ELECTRIC VEHICLES

02:48:55.725 --> 02:48:57.227
AT HOME VERSUS IF THERE AND

02:48:57.293 --> 02:48:58.495
YOU KNOW HAVING TO CHARGE

02:48:58.561 --> 02:49:00.830
AN OFFICER OR AT DIFFERENT

02:49:00.897 --> 02:49:02.098
TIMES A DAY AS OPPOSED TO

02:49:02.165 --> 02:49:04.234
BEING WHERE WE USED TO ALL BE

02:49:04.300 --> 02:49:05.602
IN THE OFFICE DURING THE DAY

02:49:05.668 --> 02:49:08.071
ALL DAY LONG NOW MAYBE THAT

02:49:08.137 --> 02:49:09.606
MOVING ALONG JUST AS P.

02:49:09.672 --> 02:49:12.141
BECAUSE CHANGED HOW DO YOU

02:49:12.208 --> 02:49:13.710
ADJUST FOR THE PEAK CHANGING

02:49:13.776 --> 02:49:14.978
ON WHAT THE ELECTRIC VEHICLE

02:49:15.044 --> 02:49:16.212
CHARGING REQUIREMENTS WILL

02:49:16.279 --> 02:49:17.914
BE AND THEN I HAVE A RELEASED

02:49:17.981 --> 02:49:19.282
RANDOM STUPID QUESTION BECAUSE

02:49:19.349 --> 02:49:20.483
I ACTUALLY DID AT ONE POINT

02:49:20.550 --> 02:49:21.618
SINCE I HAVE YOU I'M AS A

02:49:21.684 --> 02:49:24.087
MASCOT -- I DID THINK ABOUT

02:49:24.153 --> 02:49:25.622
BUYING ELECTRIC CAR NOT TOO

02:49:25.688 --> 02:49:27.257
LONG AGO AND THEN THESE POWER

02:49:27.323 --> 02:49:29.092
OUTAGES WHEN OUT SO WHAT

02:49:29.158 --> 02:49:30.426
HAPPENS TO ME OF MY ELECTRIC

02:49:30.493 --> 02:49:31.528
CAR AND THE POWER GOES OUT

02:49:31.594 --> 02:49:32.862
FOR TWO DAYS WHAT WHAT WAS

02:49:32.929 --> 02:49:37.200
MY CAR I DON'T CHARGE MY CAR

02:49:37.267 --> 02:49:39.936
I GOT A BICYCLE

02:49:40.003 --> 02:49:42.238
SO I BELIEVE I CAN RESPOND

02:49:42.305 --> 02:49:43.473
THAT THE NAVY SILVA WOULD YOU

02:49:43.540 --> 02:49:44.574
RESPOND HER FIRST QUESTION

02:49:44.641 --> 02:49:46.175
FIRST AND I'LL TAKE THAT SECOND

02:49:46.242 --> 02:49:48.945
YEAH ABSOLUTELY -- I THANK YOU

02:49:49.012 --> 02:49:49.812
FOR THOSE QUESTIONS I THINK

02:49:49.879 --> 02:49:52.181
THOSE ARE -- REALLY INSIGHTFUL

02:49:52.248 --> 02:49:54.150
QUESTIONS SPECIFICALLY ON

02:49:54.217 --> 02:49:56.586
THE IMPACT OF THAT COLLUDED

02:49:56.653 --> 02:49:57.954
-- UP ON SOME OF THE LOWER

02:49:58.021 --> 02:49:59.322
CHIPS SO I JUST WANNA MAKE

02:49:59.389 --> 02:50:01.691
SURE I I KIND OF PUT THIS OUT

02:50:01.758 --> 02:50:04.460
THERE IN TERMS OF HOW WE DO

02:50:04.527 --> 02:50:05.828
A DIFFERENT KIND OF THAT TIME

02:50:05.895 --> 02:50:06.863
HORIZON SO WE HAVE T.

02:50:06.930 --> 02:50:08.064
TIME HORIZONS THAT WE PLANNED

02:50:08.131 --> 02:50:09.732
FOR SO ONE IS THAT HE TO

02:50:09.799 --> 02:50:11.935
HAD A TIME HORIZON WHICH IS

02:50:12.001 --> 02:50:13.069
SPECIFICALLY USED FOR THE

02:50:13.136 --> 02:50:15.471
RESOURCE ADEQUACY PROCESS AND

02:50:15.538 --> 02:50:17.707
WE WE HAVE A TEN YEAR TIME

02:50:17.774 --> 02:50:19.242
FRAME WHICH IS USED FOR THE

02:50:19.309 --> 02:50:20.877
TRANSMISSION PLANNING AND THE

02:50:20.944 --> 02:50:22.979
IRP PROCESS SEES AND THEN WE

02:50:23.046 --> 02:50:24.581
HAVE THE TWENTY FIVE HORIZON

02:50:24.647 --> 02:50:26.282
PLANNING WHICH IS THE SB ONE

02:50:26.349 --> 02:50:27.517
HUNDRED PLANNING SO ALL THREE

02:50:27.584 --> 02:50:29.419
OF THEM HAVE TO BEGIN TO

02:50:29.485 --> 02:50:30.987
HARMONIZE I THINK THAT'S A VERY

02:50:31.054 --> 02:50:33.089
IMPORTANT POINT MOVING FORWARD

02:50:33.156 --> 02:50:34.424
EACH OF THEM THAT THINGS ARE

02:50:34.490 --> 02:50:36.859
CHANGING VERY RAPIDLY BOTH ON

02:50:36.926 --> 02:50:38.428
THE SUPPLY AND THE DEMAND SIDE

02:50:38.494 --> 02:50:40.263
IN TERMS OF ELECTRIFICATION THE

02:50:40.330 --> 02:50:42.432
TYPE OF LOS INSURED OBSERVING

02:50:42.498 --> 02:50:44.100
SO THAT THE HARMONIZATION OF

02:50:44.167 --> 02:50:46.903
THOSE THE HORIZONS IS IS VERY

02:50:46.970 --> 02:50:48.404
IMPORTANT AND I I THINK IT'S

02:50:48.471 --> 02:50:51.140
VERY WELL OBSERVED AS FAR AS --

02:50:51.207 --> 02:50:53.409
THE SPECIFIC -- LOW CHIPS ARE

02:50:53.476 --> 02:50:54.877
CONCERNED IN TERMS OF COLLUDED

02:50:54.944 --> 02:50:59.282
RPGS WE -- HAVE -- THAT I AM

02:50:59.349 --> 02:51:00.683
THE DATA AT THE INTERVAL METER

02:51:00.750 --> 02:51:02.452
DATA THAT'S GOING TO BE COMING

02:51:02.518 --> 02:51:06.089
INTO A CC -- IN THE NEXT MONTH

02:51:06.155 --> 02:51:08.658
OR SO -- WE'VE PASSED AND THE

02:51:08.725 --> 02:51:11.127
DATA REGULATIONS LAST YEAR WE

02:51:11.194 --> 02:51:15.164
WE GET THE TOP FIVE -- CALYCES

02:51:15.231 --> 02:51:17.467
AND METER DATA AND THAT NEITHER

02:51:17.533 --> 02:51:20.069
DATA WILL BE USED TO UNDERSTAND

02:51:20.136 --> 02:51:21.371
THE CHANGING PATTERNS AND

02:51:21.437 --> 02:51:23.272
THE LOAD SHAPES AND AND THOSE

02:51:23.339 --> 02:51:25.808
WILL BE USED AT THE TWO ACTIVE

02:51:25.875 --> 02:51:27.543
MERGED WITH THE DEMAND FORECAST

02:51:27.610 --> 02:51:28.645
TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE LOTUS

02:51:28.711 --> 02:51:30.413
CHANGING AN EIGHTY SEVEN

02:51:30.480 --> 02:51:34.217
SIXTY LEVEL THAT EXACT -- TO

02:51:34.283 --> 02:51:36.519
-- THE COSBY IMPACT SO THAT'S

02:51:36.586 --> 02:51:37.587
SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE HERE

02:51:37.654 --> 02:51:39.589
REALLY TRYING TO UNDERSTAND AND

02:51:39.656 --> 02:51:41.491
IT'S KIND OF HARD TO -- TAKE

02:51:41.557 --> 02:51:42.458
IT OUT BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A

02:51:42.525 --> 02:51:44.560
LOT OF HISTORY ARE WE TRYING TO

02:51:44.627 --> 02:51:45.795
UNDERSTAND WHAT'S WHAT HAPPENED

02:51:45.862 --> 02:51:47.563
OVER THE LAST FIVE SIX MONTHS

02:51:47.630 --> 02:51:48.831
AND WE GET A PLANE BAKED INTO

02:51:48.898 --> 02:51:51.000
THE FORECAST -- THAT THAT'S

02:51:51.067 --> 02:51:53.603
GONNA THAT TO ME MEETING WITH

02:51:53.670 --> 02:51:56.305
ENGINEERED A SURGE OF POWER AND

02:51:56.372 --> 02:51:57.707
THEN ONE LAST QUESTION SUPPORT

02:51:57.774 --> 02:51:59.008
I JUST NEED TO RECORD YOUR

02:51:59.075 --> 02:52:00.910
QUESTION ABOUT -- CHARGE WHICH

02:52:00.977 --> 02:52:01.778
IS I'VE BEEN DRIVING LIKE TO

02:52:01.844 --> 02:52:03.012
COVER THREE AND HALF YEARS IN

02:52:03.079 --> 02:52:04.947
CALIFORNIA GOT A LOT I'VE NEVER

02:52:05.014 --> 02:52:07.417
ONCE NOT BEEN ABLE TO CHARGE

02:52:07.483 --> 02:52:09.252
BECAUSE AGREED HOURS ARE JUST

02:52:09.318 --> 02:52:10.620
YOU KNOW POINT OUT WE ARE HERE

02:52:10.687 --> 02:52:12.989
TODAY TALKING ABOUT -- ALL THIS

02:52:13.056 --> 02:52:14.357
BECAUSE OF WHAT HAPPENED IN

02:52:14.424 --> 02:52:15.625
AUGUST BUT THAT WAS TWO AND A

02:52:15.692 --> 02:52:17.260
HALF HOURS ON THE FOURTEENTH

02:52:17.326 --> 02:52:18.795
AN HOUR AND A HALF ON THE

02:52:18.861 --> 02:52:20.797
FIFTEENTH AND WE'RE -- YOU KNOW

02:52:20.863 --> 02:52:22.965
GENERALLY SPEAKING IN THE GRID

02:52:23.032 --> 02:52:24.233
-- ACTUALLY I BRISTLED WOULD

02:52:24.300 --> 02:52:25.435
BE THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY

02:52:25.501 --> 02:52:26.569
IN THE WORLD AND HAVE ALL THESE

02:52:26.636 --> 02:52:27.704
COMPANIES COME LOOK AT HERE IF

02:52:27.770 --> 02:52:29.739
THAT WERE THE CASE THERE ARE

02:52:29.806 --> 02:52:31.240
ADDITIONAL REDUNDANCIES BEING

02:52:31.307 --> 02:52:32.475
POLLUTED BY NUMBER THE V.

02:52:32.542 --> 02:52:33.609
CHARGING COMPANIES INCLUDING

02:52:33.676 --> 02:52:36.412
ONSITE STORAGE -- AND AND SOLAR

02:52:36.479 --> 02:52:37.547
ONSITE WHICH YOU'RE SEEING

02:52:37.613 --> 02:52:39.048
WE'VE ACTUALLY -- SOME COPIES

02:52:39.115 --> 02:52:41.384
OF THE STANDALONE SOLAR BATTERY

02:52:41.451 --> 02:52:43.219
STORAGE CHARGING STATIONS THAT

THE NEW COMPANY THAT'S BEEN

02:52:44.153 --> 02:52:45.788
BUILT AND SO THAT ADDITIONAL

02:52:45.855 --> 02:52:47.557
REDUNDANCIES IS -- GOING TO

02:52:47.623 --> 02:52:49.759
PLACES WELL IN WITH ALL DUE

02:52:49.826 --> 02:52:52.395
RESPECT I YOU MOSTLY MEET SOME

02:52:52.462 --> 02:52:53.296
PEOPLE MAY HAVE HAD TWO OR

02:52:53.362 --> 02:52:55.598
THREE HOURS BUT I HAVE FAMILY I

THAT HAD TO WIN THREE TWO DAYS

02:52:59.869 --> 02:53:01.237
WITHOUT POWER WHO HAD ELECTRIC

02:53:01.304 --> 02:53:04.674
VEHICLES WHO ARE OLDER AND I

02:53:04.741 --> 02:53:06.142
I KNOW THAT FOR A FACT I DID A

02:53:06.209 --> 02:53:07.710
BILL ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO OR

02:53:07.777 --> 02:53:08.945
WE TRY TO PUT CHARGING WHERE WE

02:53:09.011 --> 02:53:10.379
PUT CHARGING STATIONS SIGN PUT

02:53:10.446 --> 02:53:11.614

02:53:11.681 --> 02:53:13.549
STATIONS IN AT PARKS AND

02:53:13.616 --> 02:53:14.751
SCHOOL WE TRY TO GET SCHOOLS

02:53:14.817 --> 02:53:16.085
COULDN'T GET SCHOOLS PARKS AND

02:53:16.152 --> 02:53:18.087
BEACHES AND THOSE START THERE

02:53:18.154 --> 02:53:19.388
SO THOSE REDUNDANCIES AREN'T

02:53:19.455 --> 02:53:20.823
THERE YET IN ALL DUE RESPECT

02:53:20.890 --> 02:53:22.258
AND THESE ARE OLDER INDIVIDUALS

02:53:22.325 --> 02:53:23.292
WHO HAVE AN ELECTRIC CAR WHO

02:53:23.359 --> 02:53:25.561
HAD NO POWER FOR TWO DAYS SO

02:53:25.628 --> 02:53:26.963
THAT MAYBE YOUR REALITY AND

02:53:27.029 --> 02:53:28.264
I'LL TELL YOU FOR SURE IF I

02:53:28.331 --> 02:53:29.799
WAS IN MY COMMUNITY BY WERE

02:53:29.866 --> 02:53:31.367
IN MY COMMUNITY THE REALITY IS

02:53:31.434 --> 02:53:33.169
THERE WOULD BE NO REDUNDANCIES

02:53:33.236 --> 02:53:35.104
NOT AT LEAST FOR AN HOUR AWAY

02:53:35.171 --> 02:53:36.072
AND AS A MEMBER WHO'S BEEN

02:53:36.139 --> 02:53:37.406
DRIVING BACK AND FORTH THREE

02:53:37.473 --> 02:53:38.908
HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES FROM

02:53:38.975 --> 02:53:40.543
LA TO SACRAMENTO BECAUSE OF

02:53:40.610 --> 02:53:42.478
KOBE I HAVE LEARNED THAT THINGS

02:53:42.545 --> 02:53:45.047
CHANGE AND THINGS ARE DRASTIC

02:53:45.114 --> 02:53:46.449
AND DIFFERENT NOW THAN THEY

02:53:46.516 --> 02:53:47.483
HAVE BEEN OVER THE LAST TEN

02:53:47.550 --> 02:53:48.618
YEARS SO THAT'S JUST WITH ALL

02:53:48.684 --> 02:53:49.619
DUE RESPECT AND THEN JUST ONE

02:53:49.685 --> 02:53:51.721
MORE QUESTION -- SO FOR YOUR

02:53:51.788 --> 02:53:52.989
PLANNING PROCESS HE'S I'M

02:53:53.055 --> 02:53:54.991
JUST CURIOUS IS THERE ANYWAY

02:53:55.057 --> 02:53:56.425
-- WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE

02:53:56.492 --> 02:53:58.628
RESOURCE ADEQUACY KIND OF NEW

02:53:58.694 --> 02:53:59.796
FORMULATION OF WHAT THAT'S

02:53:59.862 --> 02:54:00.830
GOING THAT PROGRAM A LOOK

02:54:00.897 --> 02:54:02.999
LIKE DO WE NEED TO CREATE SOME

02:54:03.065 --> 02:54:04.667
FLEXIBILITY AS TO WHAT PEAK

02:54:04.734 --> 02:54:06.569
IS BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE JUST AYE

02:54:06.636 --> 02:54:08.137
IT SOUNDS LIKE PEOPLE IT JUST

02:54:08.204 --> 02:54:09.605
DEPENDING ON WHAT IS HAPPENING

02:54:09.672 --> 02:54:11.007
IN THE WORLD AND IN LIFE AND

02:54:11.073 --> 02:54:12.408
INSTEAD OF HAVING TO GO BACK

02:54:12.475 --> 02:54:13.609
TO THE DRAWING BOARD EVERY

02:54:13.676 --> 02:54:15.244
TIME TO LOOK AT THAT PROGRAM

02:54:15.311 --> 02:54:16.579
IS THERE A WAY TO TAKE INTO

02:54:16.646 --> 02:54:18.781
ACCOUNT THAT USED TO BE IN

02:54:18.848 --> 02:54:19.949
THE MAIL TODAY THAT PEAK IS

02:54:20.016 --> 02:54:21.517
NOW THREE TO NINE OR WHATEVER

02:54:21.584 --> 02:54:23.119
IT IS AND THEN NOT ME I JUST

02:54:23.186 --> 02:54:24.987
EXPAND OR WHATEVER IS THERE

02:54:25.054 --> 02:54:27.256
IS THAT ON THE HORIZON IN THAT

02:54:27.323 --> 02:54:28.858
PROGRAM GOING TO BE INTEGRATED

02:54:28.925 --> 02:54:29.926
INTO THAT PROGRAM THAT'S MY

02:54:29.992 --> 02:54:33.095
LAST QUESTION I'M AYE I THINK

02:54:33.162 --> 02:54:35.932
IF I MAY I THINK THAT THE NET

02:54:35.998 --> 02:54:38.868
PEAK IS FAIRLY DEFINED AT THIS

02:54:38.935 --> 02:54:40.937
TIME I DON'T KNOW OTHER THAN ON

02:54:41.003 --> 02:54:42.939
THE MARGINS WHERE THINGS WILL

02:54:43.005 --> 02:54:47.043
ADJUST -- DEFINITELY CODED AS

02:54:47.109 --> 02:54:49.545
YOU OF REMARKED AND CHANGED

02:54:49.612 --> 02:54:51.447
SOME OF THE USAGE AND TIME

02:54:51.514 --> 02:54:54.717
OF USAGE AND DEMAND UN WHERE

02:54:54.784 --> 02:54:56.252
SOME OF THE LARGE COMMERCIAL

02:54:56.319 --> 02:54:58.588
WENT DOWN HIGHER AND HIGHER

02:54:58.654 --> 02:54:59.755
DEMAND WHAT HAPPENED SOME OF

02:54:59.822 --> 02:55:01.891
THE RESIDENTIAL TIMES PLACES

AND TIME PERIODS -- BUT THE

02:55:05.561 --> 02:55:08.231
THE RESOURCE ADEQUACY AYE AYE

02:55:08.297 --> 02:55:10.766
AYE WE HAVE WE HAVE FLEXIBILITY

02:55:10.833 --> 02:55:12.568
AND WE WE HOW WE MANAGE OUR

02:55:12.635 --> 02:55:16.072
PROCEEDING IS IS THAT AND AND

02:55:16.138 --> 02:55:17.707
WE CAN OBVIOUSLY BE CRITICIZED

02:55:17.773 --> 02:55:19.175
AND HAVE BEEN AND WE CAN

02:55:19.242 --> 02:55:22.178
CORRECT -- BUT I I THINK WE

02:55:22.245 --> 02:55:24.313
HAVE THE THE FLEXIBILITY THAT

02:55:24.380 --> 02:55:26.983

MY REMARKS -- WE HAVE TWENTY

02:59:20.716 --> 02:59:22.818
FOUR HUNDRED MEGAWATTS THAT ARE

IN TERMS OF THE PERMITTING --

02:59:46.175 --> 02:59:48.144
THAT YOU MENTIONED MUCH OF THAT

02:59:48.210 --> 02:59:50.279
AND I BELIEVE -- MY COLLEAGUE

02:59:50.346 --> 02:59:51.714
MENTIONED THIS EARLIER SOME OF

02:59:51.780 --> 02:59:54.150
THAT -- MOST OF IT IS A IS A

02:59:54.216 --> 02:59:58.387
LOCAL ISSUE AND -- WE ARE --

CLOSELY AND AND WILL CONTINUE

03:00:05.895 --> 03:00:07.463
SO IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT

03:00:07.530 --> 03:00:09.098
IS CURRENT YOU KNOW THAT WE

03:00:09.165 --> 03:00:11.600
REALIZE IS IS GOING TO --

03:00:11.667 --> 03:00:13.636
SLOW A PROJECT IN TERMS OF

03:00:13.702 --> 03:00:17.039
ITS DEVELOPMENT AND OUTCOME IN

03:00:17.106 --> 03:00:18.174
THE TIME FRAMES THAT WE HAVE

03:00:18.240 --> 03:00:21.377
SCHEDULED IT -- WE WILL --

03:00:21.443 --> 03:00:23.112
INDEED BE WORKING WITH LOCAL

03:00:23.179 --> 03:00:25.814
OFFICIALS -- TO ENSURE THAT

03:00:25.881 --> 03:00:27.783

THIS PROCESS OF THEM WE'RE

03:00:35.090 --> 03:00:37.893
VERY AWARE OF THE CONCERNS

03:00:37.960 --> 03:00:39.161
IS THERE A NEED FOR ANY

03:00:39.228 --> 03:00:42.064
LEGISLATIVE ACTION TO -- HELP

03:00:42.131 --> 03:00:43.699

AND THE I DON'T KNOW OF ANY

03:00:46.101 --> 03:00:48.437
NOW CERTAINLY I THINK THAT

03:00:48.504 --> 03:00:51.307
WOULD BE DIFFICULT FOR --

03:00:51.373 --> 03:00:52.374

TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION

03:01:25.874 --> 03:01:28.077
DISTRIBUTION PROVIDERS --

03:01:28.143 --> 03:01:29.778
CAN EXPEDITE INTERCONNECTION

03:01:29.845 --> 03:01:31.213
AND AVOID THE INTERCONNECTION

03:01:31.280 --> 03:01:33.349
DELAYS WHICH CAN SLOW DOWN

03:01:33.415 --> 03:01:35.618
PROJECTS BY MONTHS OR MORE I I

03:01:35.684 --> 03:01:37.720

WE CREATING NEW DEMANDS ON

03:02:30.739 --> 03:02:32.708
ELECTRICITY GENERATION BUT

03:02:32.775 --> 03:02:35.110
THAT WE ARE ALSO TAKING --

03:02:35.177 --> 03:02:39.348
GENERATORS OFFLINE -- I KNOW

03:02:39.415 --> 03:02:41.617
THAT THIS IS -- IN A PART OF

03:02:41.684 --> 03:02:44.353

JOB IF I DIDN'T RAISE THE THE

03:02:55.664 --> 03:02:57.733
CONCERN ABOUT HOW IN REDONDO

03:02:57.800 --> 03:02:58.967
BEACH IN A WEEK WE HAD BEEN

03:02:59.034 --> 03:03:01.337
PLANNING FOR TEN YEARS TO TAKE

03:03:01.403 --> 03:03:03.772
THAT -- NATURAL GAS POWER PLANT

03:03:03.839 --> 03:03:06.742
-- OFFLINE AND AND NOW -- THERE

03:03:06.809 --> 03:03:08.077
THERE WAS A ONE YEAR EXTENSION

03:03:08.143 --> 03:03:09.678
I BELIEVE THAT WAS EXTENDED FOR

03:03:09.745 --> 03:03:11.613
THE REDONDO BEACH POWER PLANTS

03:03:11.680 --> 03:03:14.717
YES HOW -- HOW RELIABLE IS

03:03:14.783 --> 03:03:16.118
THAT ONE YEAR POWER PLANT HOW

03:03:16.185 --> 03:03:17.986
TO HOW DO WE KNOW THAT TO THAT

03:03:18.053 --> 03:03:19.421
IS NOT GOING TO BE EXTENDED

03:03:19.488 --> 03:03:22.558
TO -- FOR MORE DOWN THE LINE

03:03:22.624 --> 03:03:24.827
WELL YOU KNOW THAT THE -- THE

03:03:24.893 --> 03:03:27.029
THREE OF US -- ASK FOR THAT

03:03:27.096 --> 03:03:29.264
EXTENSION THAT WAS APPROVED

03:03:29.331 --> 03:03:31.500
BY THE WATER BOARD -- AND IN

03:03:31.567 --> 03:03:33.836
THAT IN WE WERE ASKED THAT

03:03:33.902 --> 03:03:36.572
QUESTION AND WE SAID THAT --

03:03:36.638 --> 03:03:38.140
WE FELT THAT THE ONE YEAR WAS

03:03:38.207 --> 03:03:41.210
WAS ADEQUATE -- AND AGAIN IT'S

03:03:41.276 --> 03:03:42.678
SOMETHING WILL HAVE TO MONITOR

03:03:42.745 --> 03:03:44.646
BUT -- WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO

03:03:44.713 --> 03:03:48.117
COME BACK AND ASK ANOTHER TIME

03:03:48.183 --> 03:03:52.020
THANK YOU THANK YOU I WANTED

03:03:52.087 --> 03:03:54.456
TO TO SORT OF RAISE A QUICK

03:03:54.523 --> 03:03:56.592
QUESTION THAT I WOULD POST --

03:03:56.658 --> 03:03:57.659
TO EACH OF YOU AND THEN WE'RE

03:03:57.726 --> 03:03:59.862
GOING TO TURN TO OUR OUR PUBLIC

03:03:59.928 --> 03:04:02.231
FOR THEIR COMMENT A COUPLE

03:04:02.297 --> 03:04:04.566
YEARS AGO I INTRODUCED A BILL

03:04:04.633 --> 03:04:06.368
THAT ADDRESSED THE ISSUE OF

03:04:06.435 --> 03:04:07.703
REGIONAL LIES IN THE GROUND

03:04:07.770 --> 03:04:10.239
AND ALLOWING FOR THE FOURTEEN

03:04:10.305 --> 03:04:12.141
WESTERN STATES TO PARTICIPATE

03:04:12.207 --> 03:04:13.575
IN A MORE EFFICIENT WAY AND

03:04:13.642 --> 03:04:16.879
WHERE WE ARE IN A POSITION

03:04:16.945 --> 03:04:18.180
HAS BEEN DESCRIBED WHEN THE

03:04:18.247 --> 03:04:20.582
WIND IS NOT BLOWING HERE IT

03:04:20.649 --> 03:04:22.551
MAY BE BLOWING IN OTHER STATES

03:04:22.618 --> 03:04:23.819
AND WE CAN HAVE ACCESS TO

03:04:23.886 --> 03:04:26.088
THAT -- POWER THAT'S PRODUCED

03:04:26.155 --> 03:04:29.458
FROM WIND -- AND OTHER OTHER

03:04:29.525 --> 03:04:32.294
STATES WHEN WE HAVE PRODUCED

03:04:32.361 --> 03:04:34.430
IN EXCESS OF SOLAR THEN WE

03:04:34.496 --> 03:04:36.298
BECOME AN EXPORTER AND WE

03:04:36.365 --> 03:04:37.833
HAVE GREATER EFFICIENCIES THAT

03:04:37.900 --> 03:04:39.201
WOULD BE DERIVED FROM THAT

03:04:39.268 --> 03:04:42.604
AND ULTIMATELY COST REDUCTION

03:04:42.671 --> 03:04:43.405
WHICH WE DON'T HEAR VERY

03:04:43.472 --> 03:04:45.574
OFTEN IN TERMS OF IMPACT ON

03:04:45.641 --> 03:04:48.010
RATEPAYERS JUST WANTED TO GET

03:04:48.076 --> 03:04:49.645
YOU GET YOUR SENSE OF THINGS

03:04:49.711 --> 03:04:50.679
BECAUSE AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

03:04:50.746 --> 03:04:52.347
PLANNING A LOT OF OUR PLANNING

03:04:52.414 --> 03:04:53.849
AND CONCEPTS OF PLANNING IS

03:04:53.916 --> 03:04:56.118
WITHIN OUR FOUR WALLS IF YOU

03:04:56.185 --> 03:04:59.922
WILL -- TOUR EXPAND AND TO

03:04:59.988 --> 03:05:02.458
HAVE AN INTERCONNECTED GRID

03:05:02.524 --> 03:05:05.594
WITH FOURTEEN WESTERN STATES

03:05:05.661 --> 03:05:09.765
PLANNING ON A LARGER -- BASIS

03:05:09.832 --> 03:05:11.567
CREATES EVEN I WOULD IMAGINE

03:05:11.633 --> 03:05:14.636
GREATER OPPORTUNITIES WHAT

03:05:14.703 --> 03:05:15.838
ARE YOUR THOUGHTS AND ARE

03:05:15.904 --> 03:05:18.240
WE FINDING OURSELVES GETTING

03:05:18.307 --> 03:05:20.509
CLOSER TO A POINT IN TIME

03:05:20.576 --> 03:05:21.977
WE'RE HAVING AN EXPANDED RATE

03:05:22.044 --> 03:05:29.551
REGIONAL READ MAKES MORE SENSE

03:05:29.618 --> 03:05:31.520
STEVE DO YOU WANT TO BEGIN

03:05:31.587 --> 03:05:34.223
-- ALL ALL LEAN INTO THAT --

03:05:34.289 --> 03:05:35.724
GIVEN MY MY HISTORY ON THIS

03:05:35.791 --> 03:05:37.226
TOPIC AND THEN TURNED OVER TO

03:05:37.292 --> 03:05:39.027
MY SUCCESSOR MISTER MAYNES OR

03:05:39.094 --> 03:05:43.131
-- -- I BELIEVE -- REGIONAL

03:05:43.198 --> 03:05:45.601
COLLABORATION -- IS CRITICAL TO

03:05:45.667 --> 03:05:48.537
HOLDING DOWN COSTS AND IT CAN

03:05:48.604 --> 03:05:51.139
SIGNIFICANTLY -- CONTRIBUTE TO

03:05:51.206 --> 03:05:53.575
RELIABILITY IT TAKES FRICTION

03:05:53.642 --> 03:05:55.277
OUT OF THE SYSTEM YOU'RE NOT NO

03:05:55.344 --> 03:05:56.879
YOU'RE NO LONGER COMPETING WITH

03:05:56.945 --> 03:05:58.914
ELECTRONS WITH OTHER BALANCING

03:05:58.981 --> 03:06:01.617
AREAS AND OTHER STATES AND

03:06:01.683 --> 03:06:04.786
-- IT ALSO GIVES YOU -- THE

03:06:04.853 --> 03:06:06.288
ABILITY TO HAVE A PORTFOLIO

03:06:06.355 --> 03:06:08.724
FACT VERTICAL WITH RENEWABLES

03:06:08.790 --> 03:06:11.393
WHICH IS VERY POWERFUL AND

03:06:11.460 --> 03:06:14.396
ALL NOTES -- PREVIOUSLY I KNOW

03:06:14.463 --> 03:06:15.664
THERE'S BEEN SOME CONCERN THAT

03:06:15.731 --> 03:06:16.899
THE OTHER STATES ARE OUT OF

03:06:16.965 --> 03:06:18.700
ALIGNMENT WITH CALIFORNIA'S

03:06:18.767 --> 03:06:20.969
POLICY OBJECTIVES BUT PRETTY

03:06:21.036 --> 03:06:24.273
MUCH MOST OF THE POPULATION IS

03:06:24.339 --> 03:06:25.741
IN THE WEST KNOWS AND STATES

03:06:25.807 --> 03:06:27.409
THAT ARE VERY ALIGNED WITH

03:06:27.476 --> 03:06:30.312
CALIFORNIA'S DOING SO -- I

03:06:30.379 --> 03:06:31.980
THINK THAT COLLABORATION IS

03:06:32.047 --> 03:06:33.482
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THE OTHER

03:06:33.549 --> 03:06:35.384
THING THAT I WOULD KNOW IS

03:06:35.450 --> 03:06:37.753
I'VE SPENT A LOT OF TIME --

03:06:37.819 --> 03:06:39.087
SEEING IT WITH THE EUROPEANS

03:06:39.154 --> 03:06:41.423
ARE DOING THEY WERE ON A

03:06:41.490 --> 03:06:44.459
EUROPEAN WIDE DAY AHEAD MARKET

03:06:44.526 --> 03:06:46.428
-- TO DO EXACTLY WHAT I JUST

03:06:46.495 --> 03:06:49.264
SAID IN ADDITION TO THAT THEY

03:06:49.331 --> 03:06:52.367
COLLABORATE VERY WELL WITH

03:06:52.434 --> 03:06:53.835
TRANSMISSION PROJECTS AS AN

03:06:53.902 --> 03:06:56.038
EXAMPLE GERMANY HAS CONNECTED

03:06:56.104 --> 03:06:58.507
WITH NORWAY TO USE OUR HYDRO

03:06:58.574 --> 03:07:00.008
FLEET TO HELP INTERPRET

03:07:00.075 --> 03:07:02.177
THE RULES THAT'S AN EXAMPLE

03:07:02.244 --> 03:07:03.979
OF THE REGIONAL IMPACT THE

03:07:04.046 --> 03:07:05.547
COLLABORATION AND I'M GONNA

03:07:05.614 --> 03:07:07.149
LEAVE IT AT THAT AND AND

03:07:07.215 --> 03:07:08.951
-- TURNED OVER BECAUSE THIS

03:07:09.017 --> 03:07:10.319
CONVERSATION TO BE HAD ABOUT

03:07:10.385 --> 03:07:13.155
IT WILL BE WITH MY SUCCESSOR

03:07:13.221 --> 03:07:14.923
WELL THANK THANK YOU STEPHEN

03:07:14.990 --> 03:07:16.325

ASKING THE QUESTION OBVIOUSLY

03:07:17.726 --> 03:07:19.628
IS THE NEWCOMER HERE I HAVE

03:07:19.695 --> 03:07:21.463
A LOTS OF LISTENING TO MUCH

03:07:21.530 --> 03:07:22.464
OF LEARNING TO DO ON THIS

03:07:22.531 --> 03:07:24.232
TOPIC -- PARTICULARS IN THE

03:07:24.299 --> 03:07:25.867
STATE OF CALIFORNIA I'VE FIRST

03:07:25.934 --> 03:07:26.868
BEEN OPERATING IN THE PACIFIC

03:07:26.935 --> 03:07:27.869
NORTHWEST FOR LAST SEVERAL

03:07:27.936 --> 03:07:29.004
YEARS SINCE IT'S AN ISSUE

03:07:29.071 --> 03:07:32.040
OF TRACK CAREFULLY CLOSELY I

03:07:32.107 --> 03:07:33.342
THINK FOR ME FOR PURPOSES OF

03:07:33.408 --> 03:07:35.911
CONVERSATION TODAY -- I THINK

03:07:35.978 --> 03:07:38.380
THERE CERTAINLY ARE ARE LOTS OF

03:07:38.447 --> 03:07:41.450
OF OF APPEALING OPPORTUNITIES

03:07:41.516 --> 03:07:43.185
IN WIDE AREA COORDINATION

03:07:43.251 --> 03:07:44.152
WHETHER IT'S IN THE STATE'S

03:07:44.219 --> 03:07:45.487
SUBREGION REGIONAL CENTER

03:07:45.554 --> 03:07:46.421
AND I THINK THE PHYSICS AND

03:07:46.488 --> 03:07:47.856
THE ECONOMICS OF POWER SYSTEM

03:07:47.923 --> 03:07:49.758
CERTAINLY LEND THEMSELVES TO

03:07:49.825 --> 03:07:52.094
WIDER AREA SOLUTIONS BUT I

03:07:52.160 --> 03:07:53.629
THINK IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE

03:07:53.695 --> 03:07:55.597
CONVERSATION TODAY I THINK

03:07:55.664 --> 03:07:56.598
YOU HEARD ME IN MY OPENING

03:07:56.665 --> 03:07:58.767
COMMENTS SAY THAT THAT YOU KNOW

03:07:58.834 --> 03:08:00.669
ACROSS THE WEST PARTICULARLY

03:08:00.736 --> 03:08:02.704
IN CALIFORNIA IN OTHER IS IT'S

03:08:02.771 --> 03:08:04.039
THE SAME CONVERSATION HAPPEN

03:08:04.106 --> 03:08:05.474
THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST YOU'RE

03:08:05.540 --> 03:08:07.342
GETTING RESOURCE ADEQUACY

03:08:07.409 --> 03:08:08.710
AND INTEGRATED PLANNING AND

03:08:08.777 --> 03:08:10.245
MARKET OPERATIONS WORKING

03:08:10.312 --> 03:08:11.546
REALLY WELL IT'S JUST IT'S

03:08:11.613 --> 03:08:13.815
JUST FOUNDATIONAL AND I THINK

03:08:13.882 --> 03:08:15.417
THERE IS THIS THIS IS A MOMENT

03:08:15.484 --> 03:08:16.985
I THINK THAT YOU KNOW THIS IS

03:08:17.052 --> 03:08:18.387
OBVIOUSLY AN INFLECTION POINT

03:08:18.453 --> 03:08:20.355
FOR CALIFORNIA ON THE PATH TO

03:08:20.422 --> 03:08:21.923
DO RELIABLY DECARBONISING ITS

03:08:21.990 --> 03:08:24.459
GRID I AM GOING TO TAKE AWAY

03:08:24.526 --> 03:08:25.827
FROM THIS CONVERSATION STAY

03:08:25.894 --> 03:08:27.029
AT THE GENERAL SENTIMENT THERE

03:08:27.095 --> 03:08:28.597
ISN'T THERE THERE'S INTEREST

03:08:28.664 --> 03:08:29.998
THERE'S A SENSE OF URGENCY A

03:08:30.065 --> 03:08:31.566
WILLINGNESS TO HELP A SENSE

03:08:31.633 --> 03:08:32.701
OF SHARED ACCOUNTABILITY I

03:08:32.768 --> 03:08:34.302
THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT

03:08:40.475 --> 03:08:42.577
AS WE'VE SEEN THE WEST IS AN

03:08:42.644 --> 03:08:44.279
INTERDEPENDENT MARKET TODAY WE

03:08:44.346 --> 03:08:45.681
YOU KNOW YOU TALK ABOUT IMPORTS

03:08:45.747 --> 03:08:47.549

03:08:49.785 --> 03:08:51.086
TOWARDS BROADER EXPANSION OF

FOURTEENTH AND FIFTEENTH AND

03:09:28.156 --> 03:09:29.925
RESULTED IN SOME SIGNIFICANT

03:09:29.991 --> 03:09:31.960
STEP UP IN OUR ACTIVITIES AND

03:09:32.027 --> 03:09:34.029
A LOT OF REALLY INTELLIGENT

03:09:34.096 --> 03:09:35.797
CAPABLE AND COMMITTED PEOPLE

THAT OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA --

03:09:48.176 --> 03:09:49.311
FOLKS ARE WATCHING CAREFULLY

03:09:49.377 --> 03:09:50.645

LOGICAL SENSE TO ME THAT --

03:10:46.301 --> 03:10:49.171
REGIONALIZATION IS SOMETHING

03:10:49.237 --> 03:10:50.605
THAT WE ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO

03:10:50.672 --> 03:10:52.040

THE COUNTRY HAS BEEN TOWARDS

03:11:19.601 --> 03:11:20.969
REGIONALIZATION SO THE QUESTION

03:11:21.036 --> 03:11:22.504
ISN'T WHETHER LEGALIZATION WILL

03:11:22.571 --> 03:11:23.839

PRELIMINARY REPORT CORRECTLY

03:45:49.035 --> 03:45:51.070
IDENTIFIED THE PROBLEM THAT

03:45:51.137 --> 03:45:52.839
THE UNDER SCHEDULING OF LOAD

03:45:52.906 --> 03:45:54.941
BY SCHEDULING COORDINATORS YOU

03:45:55.008 --> 03:45:57.477
CAN UTILITIES AND DIRECT ACCESS

03:45:57.543 --> 03:45:59.579
CENTER AT THE DETRIMENTAL

03:45:59.646 --> 03:46:01.080

03:46:01.147 --> 03:46:02.849
ENERGY MARKET APPROPRIATELY

03:46:02.916 --> 03:46:04.417
REFLECT THE ACTUAL NEED ON

03:46:04.484 --> 03:46:06.152
THE SYSTEM AND SUBSEQUENTLY

03:46:06.219 --> 03:46:07.921
SIGNALING THAT MORE EXPORTS

03:46:07.987 --> 03:46:09.856
WERE ULTIMATELY THE PORTABLE

03:46:09.923 --> 03:46:12.058
FROM INTERNAL RESOURCES

03:46:12.125 --> 03:46:13.426
UNFORTUNATELY THE PRELIMINARY

03:46:13.493 --> 03:46:15.728
REPORT DOESN'T DETAIL WHY

03:46:15.795 --> 03:46:16.896
LOAD SERVING ENTITIES IN

03:46:16.963 --> 03:46:18.731
CALIFORNIA COLLECTIVELY FAILED

03:46:18.798 --> 03:46:20.466
TO ACCURATELY FORECAST YOUR

RETAIL CUSTOMERS ELECTRICITY

03:46:22.168 --> 03:46:24.437
USAGE BUT I THINK I CAN OFFER

03:46:24.504 --> 03:46:26.139
DEEPER INSIGHT ON THAT SUBJECT

03:46:26.205 --> 03:46:27.974
I'M GOING TO ECHO WHAT CALPERS

03:46:28.041 --> 03:46:31.177
DEL HAD EARLIER ALMOST EVERY

03:46:31.244 --> 03:46:32.745
RETAIL CUSTOMER IN CALIFORNIA

03:46:32.812 --> 03:46:34.681
HAS THE SMART METER YOUR RECORD

03:46:34.747 --> 03:46:36.049
HOW MUCH ELECTRICITY BEING

03:46:36.115 --> 03:46:37.750
USED ON AN HOUR EARLIER IN THE

03:46:37.817 --> 03:46:40.653
DEBATE THAT DATA IS EXTREMELY

03:46:40.720 --> 03:46:42.388
VALUABLE IN TERMS OF ENHANCING

03:46:42.455 --> 03:46:43.823
THE ACCURACY OF SHORT TERM

03:46:43.890 --> 03:46:45.758
LOCAL FORECAST THAT'S WHY

03:46:45.825 --> 03:46:47.493
THE UTILITIES COLLECT AND USE

03:46:47.560 --> 03:46:49.729
THAT DATA TO REFRESH THEIR OWN

03:46:49.796 --> 03:46:51.698
FORECAST OF THE ELECTRICIAN

03:46:51.764 --> 03:46:53.099
THE DEMAND PATTERNS THREE OR

03:46:53.166 --> 03:46:56.069
FOUR TIMES EVERY DAY HOWEVER

03:46:56.135 --> 03:46:58.137
THE UTILITIES DO NOT PROVIDE

03:46:58.204 --> 03:47:00.373
ACCESS TO THIS DATA IN A

03:47:00.440 --> 03:47:02.542
TIMELY FASHION FOR COMMUNITY

03:47:02.608 --> 03:47:04.677
TOWARD AGGREGATORS USE IN

03:47:04.744 --> 03:47:06.145
THEIR TYPES OF DEBT MARKET

03:47:06.212 --> 03:47:08.848
GLOBAL FORECAST TO CONSEQUENTLY

03:47:08.915 --> 03:47:11.084
COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATORS

03:47:11.150 --> 03:47:12.518
THEIR FORECASTS ARE BEING

03:47:12.585 --> 03:47:14.520
SYSTEMATICALLY DISADVANTAGED

03:47:14.587 --> 03:47:17.457
INTEGRATED IN TERMS OF ACCURACY

03:47:17.523 --> 03:47:20.626
THIS IS CONTRARY TO LAW AB --

03:47:20.693 --> 03:47:22.628
SB SEVEN NINETY WITH WOULD BE

03:47:22.695 --> 03:47:24.664
REQUIRED UTILITIES TO PURGE

03:47:24.731 --> 03:47:26.733
THIS DATA BUT THEY JUST HAVEN'T

03:47:26.799 --> 03:47:28.968
BEEN DOING THE COMMISSION AT

03:47:29.035 --> 03:47:31.871
HALF TO ENSURE THAT THE AID AT

03:47:31.938 --> 03:47:33.573
THE DATA NECESSARY TO PRODUCE

03:47:33.639 --> 03:47:34.974
ACCURATE SHORT TERM LOAN

03:47:35.041 --> 03:47:37.176
FORECAST IN OTHER WORDS THEY

03:47:37.243 --> 03:47:38.778
HAVE TO ENSURE THAT WE START

03:47:38.845 --> 03:47:40.546
ACTUALLY USING OUR SMART METERS

03:47:40.613 --> 03:47:43.483
THAT THE LEGISLATURE INTENDED

03:47:43.549 --> 03:47:44.817
SO IN CONCLUSION I THINK

03:47:44.884 --> 03:47:46.586
THIS MIGHT THIS ASPECT OF THE

03:47:46.652 --> 03:47:47.887
PROBLEM MIGHT BE ONE OF THOSE

03:47:47.954 --> 03:47:49.389
RARE SITUATIONS IN WHICH A

03:47:49.455 --> 03:47:52.225
COMPLEX PROBLEM HAS A VERY EASY
