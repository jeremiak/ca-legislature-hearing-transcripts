THE LAST- BOTH BEFORE THE

00:41:16.073 --> 00:41:20.511
PANDEMIC AND SETS- AS YOU HEARD.

00:41:20.578 --> 00:41:22.012
I THINK THAT MAKE UP NEARLY 20%

00:41:22.079 --> 00:41:23.447
OF THE STATE'S POPULATION

00:41:23.514 --> 00:41:26.283
THAT'S A 40% INCREASE BETWEEN

00:41:26.350 --> 00:41:27.518
TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY

00:41:27.585 --> 00:41:28.319
NINETEEN WITH MUCH MORE

00:41:28.385 --> 00:41:30.054
EXPECTED OVER THE NEXT FEW.

00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:32.156
DECADES ONE OUT OF EVERY FIVE

00:41:32.223 --> 00:41:33.791
PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA ISN'T THAT

00:41:33.858 --> 00:41:35.626
ENOUGH AND IN SOME REGIONS OF

00:41:35.693 --> 00:41:37.728
COURSE WHICH WAS MUCH HIGHER.

00:41:37.795 --> 00:41:39.697
SO BEFORE THE PANDEMIC MANY OF

00:41:39.763 --> 00:41:41.098
THE DISPARITIES AT THE NEST OCT

00:41:41.165 --> 00:41:42.566
BASE HAVE BEEN FALLING TO

00:41:42.633 --> 00:41:44.568
HISTORIC LOWS. BUT THEN IT HAD

00:41:44.635 --> 00:41:45.736
MADE GREAT STRIDES SINCE THE

00:41:45.803 --> 00:41:47.204
GREAT RECESSION IN BUSINESS

00:41:47.271 --> 00:41:49.139
OWNERSHIP EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES

00:41:49.206 --> 00:41:50.407
HOMEOWNERSHIP AND PURCHASING

00:41:50.474 --> 00:41:52.743
POWER THE VERY FACTORS THAT ADD

00:41:52.810 --> 00:41:54.345
TO FINANCIAL STABILITY AND

00:41:54.411 --> 00:41:56.113
BUILD WEALTH. BUT AS A GROUP

00:41:56.180 --> 00:41:57.214
THEY REMAIN MUCH MORE

00:41:57.281 --> 00:41:58.649
VULNERABLE TO ECONOMIC

00:41:58.716 --> 00:42:00.751
DOWNTURNS AND IN FACT THE COPD

00:42:00.818 --> 00:42:02.920
INDUCED RECESSION HAS WIPED OUT

00:42:02.987 --> 00:42:04.855
MANY OF THOSE ECONOMIC GAINS.

00:42:04.922 --> 00:42:06.490
IN BOTH THE CURRENT RECESSION

00:42:06.557 --> 00:42:07.491
AND THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT

00:42:07.558 --> 00:42:08.659
RECESSION I THINK THAT'S A

00:42:08.726 --> 00:42:09.793
STATE DISPROPORTIONATELY

00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:11.695
GREATER FINANCIAL LOSSES. THEY

00:42:11.762 --> 00:42:13.163
ALSO TOOK LONGER TO RECOVER

00:42:13.230 --> 00:42:14.431
THAN OTHER DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS

00:42:14.498 --> 00:42:16.467
AFTER THE LAST RECESSION JUST

00:42:16.533 --> 00:42:20.004
AS THEY ARE EXPECTED. TO DO FOR

00:42:20.070 --> 00:42:22.740
THIS RECESSION. IN THE FIRST

00:42:22.806 --> 00:42:24.008
SIX YEARS OF THE TWO THOUSAND

00:42:24.074 --> 00:42:24.942
EIGHT RECESSION WHITE NON

00:42:25.009 --> 00:42:26.543
HISPANIC HOUSEHOLDS LOTS OF

00:42:26.610 --> 00:42:28.612
TOTAL OF 30% OF THEIR WEALTH.

00:42:28.679 --> 00:42:30.714
WHILE HAT NEXT HOUSEHOLDS LOST

00:42:30.781 --> 00:42:33.617
50% OF THEIR- BAND BETWEEN TWO

00:42:33.684 --> 00:42:35.786
BY TWENTY SIXTEEN TO TWENTY

00:42:35.853 --> 00:42:36.453
NINETEEN THE MEDIAN WEALTH LEFT

00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:38.222
IN THE HOUSEHOLD ROSE FASTER

00:42:38.289 --> 00:42:39.823
THAN THAT OF WHITE HOUSEHOLDS.

00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:42.426
BUT IT'S STILL SIGNIFICANTLY

00:42:42.493 --> 00:42:42.927
LESS THAN THAT OF WHITE

00:42:42.993 --> 00:42:44.895
HOUSEHOLDS. THEY EXPECT THE

00:42:44.962 --> 00:42:47.031
EXPECTATIONS THEN IS THAT LATIN

00:42:47.097 --> 00:42:48.165
NEXT HOUSEHOLD WEALTH WILL

00:42:48.232 --> 00:42:50.200
FOLLOW A SIMILAR PATTERN DURING

00:42:50.267 --> 00:42:51.936
AND AFTER THIS RECESSION

00:42:52.002 --> 00:42:55.639
UNFORTUNATELY. BUT EVEN SO BY

00:42:55.706 --> 00:42:56.273
TWENTY NINETEEN THAT NEXT

00:42:56.340 --> 00:42:58.008
PURCHASING POWER IN CALIFORNIA

00:42:58.075 --> 00:42:59.944
ROSE TO FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY

00:43:00.010 --> 00:43:01.912
THREE BILLION DOLLARS THAT'S UP

00:43:01.979 --> 00:43:04.214
70% SINCE TWENTY TEN AND

00:43:04.281 --> 00:43:06.817
REPRESENTS ABOUT A 20% SHARE OF

00:43:06.884 --> 00:43:07.518
THE TOTAL BUYING POWER IN THE

00:43:07.584 --> 00:43:09.920
STATE. THE GAP BETWEEN LATIN

00:43:09.987 --> 00:43:11.088
ACCENT WHITE HOUSE WILL BECOME

00:43:11.155 --> 00:43:13.724
NARROWED BETWEEN TWENTY FIFTEEN

00:43:13.791 --> 00:43:15.326
AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN AS LET NEXT

00:43:15.392 --> 00:43:16.827
HOUSEHOLD RECOVERED FROM THE

00:43:16.894 --> 00:43:18.629
PREVIOUS RECESSION BUT THE

00:43:18.696 --> 00:43:19.930
AVERAGE LET NEXT HOUSEHOLD

00:43:19.997 --> 00:43:23.067
INCOME WAS STILL ONLY 68% OF

00:43:23.133 --> 00:43:26.870
WHITE HOUSEHOLD INCOME IN

00:43:26.937 --> 00:43:27.905
TWENTY EIGHTEEN. AND THEN

00:43:27.972 --> 00:43:28.706
THERE'S THE WAGE GAP. THE

00:43:28.772 --> 00:43:30.140
AVERAGE WHAT WORKING FULL TIME

00:43:30.207 --> 00:43:32.743
YEAR ROUND IN CALIFORNIA EARNED

00:43:32.810 --> 00:43:33.310
SEVENTY NINE CENTS FOR EVERY

00:43:33.377 --> 00:43:35.145
DOLLAR EARNED BY A WHITE MAN IN

00:43:35.212 --> 00:43:36.547
TWENTY NINETEEN. THAT YOU'VE

00:43:36.613 --> 00:43:38.048
HEARD LIKE PEANUTS EARNED LESS

00:43:38.115 --> 00:43:39.683
THAN FORTY TWO CENTS FOR EVERY

00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:41.085
DOLLAR EARNED BY A WHITE MAN.

00:43:41.151 --> 00:43:44.788
THAT'S A WIDER PAY GAP IN IN

00:43:44.855 --> 00:43:45.389
TWENTY ELEVEN ONE NINETEEN S.

00:43:45.456 --> 00:43:46.991
EARNED FORTY FIVE SECS. SO THAT

00:43:47.057 --> 00:43:49.293
MEANS THAT BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND

00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:49.827
SEVEN THE YEAR BEFORE THE

00:43:49.893 --> 00:43:52.863
RECESSION AND LAST AT TWENTY

00:43:52.930 --> 00:43:53.497
NINETEEN BUT THEN AS HAVE MADE

00:43:53.564 --> 00:43:55.466
ABSOLUTELY NO PROGRESS IN FACT

00:43:55.532 --> 00:43:58.736
THEY'VE LOST GROUND SINCE THE

00:43:58.802 --> 00:43:59.370
HIGH OF TWENTY ELEVEN. HOWEVER

00:43:59.436 --> 00:44:00.371
OVER THAT SAME PERIOD WHITE

00:44:00.437 --> 00:44:02.306
WOMEN HAVE INCREASED BY THREE

00:44:02.373 --> 00:44:03.974
STEPS. WHICH ISN'T GREAT BUT

00:44:04.041 --> 00:44:05.142
CERTAINLY MUCH BETTER THAN NOT

00:44:05.209 --> 00:44:06.210
BEING US AND TELLS US THAT

00:44:06.276 --> 00:44:08.512
THERE SHOULD BE THAT THAT THERE

00:44:08.579 --> 00:44:09.113
SHOULD HAVE BEEN PROGRESS FOR

00:44:09.179 --> 00:44:11.348
LETTING US AS WELL. THE WAGE

00:44:11.415 --> 00:44:13.384
GAP IS EVEN WORSE IN LOS

00:44:13.450 --> 00:44:15.586
ANGELES AND THE SILICON VALLEY-

00:44:15.652 --> 00:44:17.521
WHERE. THESE FIGURES ARE

00:44:17.588 --> 00:44:19.423
EXACERBATED BY THE HIGH COST OF

00:44:19.490 --> 00:44:20.524
LIVING IN EACH OF THOSE

00:44:20.591 --> 00:44:22.292
REGIONS. BECAUSE OF THE WAGE

00:44:22.359 --> 00:44:23.594
GAP THE AVERAGE THAT THE IT

00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:25.129
WOULD HAVE TO WORK UNTIL THE

00:44:25.195 --> 00:44:26.997
AGE OF ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN.

00:44:27.064 --> 00:44:29.800
TO EQUAL WHAT THE AVERAGE WHITE

00:44:29.867 --> 00:44:32.169
MAN EARNS BY THE AGE OF SIXTY.

00:44:32.236 --> 00:44:33.604
SO DURING THE LAST RECESSION

00:44:33.670 --> 00:44:35.606
WHEN JOBS ARE HARD TO COME BY

00:44:35.672 --> 00:44:37.975
MEDINA STARTED BUSINESSES. AND

00:44:38.042 --> 00:44:38.976
THERE'S EARLY ANECDOTAL

00:44:39.043 --> 00:44:40.511
EVIDENCE THAT THEY MAY DO SO

00:44:40.577 --> 00:44:42.780
AGAIN TO GET THROUGH. THIS

00:44:42.846 --> 00:44:45.582
RECESSION ESPECIALLY ONCE THE-

00:44:45.649 --> 00:44:47.317
THE STATE OPENS UP. I THINK

00:44:47.384 --> 00:44:49.153
THAT'S CREATED TWO POINT THREE

00:44:49.219 --> 00:44:50.554
MILLION NEW FIRMS NATIONWIDE

00:44:50.621 --> 00:44:52.923
REPRESENTING 18% OF ALL WOMEN

00:44:52.990 --> 00:44:55.426
OWNED BUSINESSES. BETWEEN

00:44:55.492 --> 00:44:55.993
TWENTY FOURTEEN AND TWENTY

00:44:56.060 --> 00:44:57.895
NINETEEN. MOST LATINO OWNED

00:44:57.961 --> 00:44:59.396
BUSINESSES ARE VERY SMALL MICRO

00:44:59.463 --> 00:45:01.131
BUSINESSES THAT WITH LESS THAN

00:45:01.198 --> 00:45:02.132
FIVE EMPLOYEES IN MANY MANY

00:45:02.199 --> 00:45:03.867
WITH NO EMPLOYEES. GET THEY

00:45:03.934 --> 00:45:05.169
STILL INCREASE THE NUMBER OF

00:45:05.235 --> 00:45:09.139
THEIR EMPLOYEES BY 30% OR CLOSE

00:45:09.206 --> 00:45:09.673
TO SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND

00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:10.674
WORKERS NATIONWIDE. BUT DESPITE

00:45:10.741 --> 00:45:11.842
IT BEING AS ENTHUSIASM FOR

00:45:11.909 --> 00:45:13.277
STARTING BUSINESSES THEY ARE

00:45:13.343 --> 00:45:14.611
LESS REVENUE THAN ALL WOMEN

00:45:14.678 --> 00:45:16.046
OWNED BUSINESSES THEY'RE LESS

00:45:16.113 --> 00:45:17.581
LIKELY TO HAVE EMPLOYEES LESS

00:45:17.648 --> 00:45:19.249
LIKELY TO SCALE AND MORE LIKELY

00:45:19.316 --> 00:45:20.918
TO OPERATE ON. RAZOR THIN

00:45:20.984 --> 00:45:25.022
MARGINS. OUT BY MAY OF 202025%

00:45:25.089 --> 00:45:26.290
OF EXISTING THAT NEXT

00:45:26.356 --> 00:45:27.124
ENTERPRENEURS HAD LOST

00:45:27.191 --> 00:45:29.093
SIGNIFICANT REVENUE DUE TO

00:45:29.159 --> 00:45:31.128
PANDEMIC RELATED CLOSURES- BUT

00:45:31.195 --> 00:45:32.296
WERE ALSO LESS LIKELY TO

00:45:32.362 --> 00:45:35.099
BENEFIT FROM THE CARES ACT

00:45:35.165 --> 00:45:38.035
RELIEF PROGRAMS. A WHILE IT

00:45:38.102 --> 00:45:39.203
MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN

00:45:39.269 --> 00:45:40.737
EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT

00:45:40.804 --> 00:45:42.172
PERSISTENT DISPARITIES IN

00:45:42.239 --> 00:45:43.006
OUTCOMES RESULT IN AN

00:45:43.073 --> 00:45:44.641
OPPORTUNITY GAP PREVENTING

00:45:44.708 --> 00:45:45.742
STUDENTS FROM REACHING THEIR

00:45:45.809 --> 00:45:47.611
EDUCATIONAL AND LIFE GOALS AND

00:45:47.678 --> 00:45:49.079
IMPORTANTLY. THIS FOLLOWS THEM

00:45:49.146 --> 00:45:50.814
INTO THEIR WAGE LEARNING WAGE

00:45:50.881 --> 00:45:52.950
EARNING YEARS LET NEXT K.

00:45:53.016 --> 00:45:55.319
THROUGH TWELVE STUDENTS HAVE-ALREADY FALLEN BEHIND A FULL

00:45:55.385 --> 00:45:57.688
ACADEMIC YEAR LAST YEAR. AND

00:45:57.754 --> 00:46:01.058
WITH- AND THIS TREND IS

00:46:01.125 --> 00:46:01.658
CONTINUING THROUGH THE CURRENT

00:46:01.725 --> 00:46:04.061
YEAR. THE TOP DRIVER OF WEALTH

00:46:04.128 --> 00:46:05.762
CREATION IT IS EQUITY IN A

00:46:05.829 --> 00:46:07.764
HOME. AFTER SEVERAL CONSECUTIVE

00:46:07.831 --> 00:46:10.100
YEARS SIX POSSIBLY SEVEN YEARS

00:46:10.167 --> 00:46:11.969
OF PURCHASING HOMES AT ABOVE

00:46:12.035 --> 00:46:13.237
AVERAGE RATES THE LIGHT NEXT

00:46:13.303 --> 00:46:15.139
HOMEOWNERSHIP RATE CALIFORNIA

00:46:15.205 --> 00:46:18.575
ROSE 2404% IN TWENTY NINETEEN

00:46:18.642 --> 00:46:20.644
COMPARED TO THE STATE AVERAGE

00:46:20.711 --> 00:46:22.679
OF FIFTY FIVE. PERCENT BUT LIVE

00:46:22.746 --> 00:46:23.947
NEXT HOMEOWNERS HAVE LESS

00:46:24.014 --> 00:46:25.816
EQUITY IN THEIR HOMES THEY HAVE

00:46:25.883 --> 00:46:27.784
LESS EQUITY IN THEIR BUSINESSES

00:46:27.851 --> 00:46:29.086
AND THEY'RE LESS LIKELY TO OWN

00:46:29.153 --> 00:46:31.088
RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS AND STOCKS

00:46:31.155 --> 00:46:32.623
ADDED THAT THE WAGE GAP AND

00:46:32.689 --> 00:46:34.258
LOWER LEVELS OF EDUCATION. AND

00:46:34.324 --> 00:46:35.559
YOU HAVE LESS FINANCIAL

00:46:35.626 --> 00:46:38.328
SECURITY AND GREATER

00:46:38.395 --> 00:46:41.231
VULNERABILITY WHEN SESSIONS HIT.

00:46:41.298 --> 00:46:42.866
BUT THE NOSE A JILL HERE LATER

00:46:42.933 --> 00:46:43.767
MAKE UP A DISPROPORTIONATE

00:46:43.834 --> 00:46:45.903
SHARE OF CONFIRMED NINETEEN OF

00:46:45.969 --> 00:46:47.771
KOBE CASES IN CALIFORNIA. THE

00:46:47.838 --> 00:46:49.873
FINANCIAL CONNECTION IS THAT

00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:51.141
TWO THIRDS OF BANKRUPTCIES

00:46:51.208 --> 00:46:52.943
RESULT FROM HIGH MEDICAL BILLS

00:46:53.010 --> 00:46:55.612
OR TO TIME LOST FROM WORK. EVEN

00:46:55.679 --> 00:46:57.080
FOR THOSE WITH HEALTH INSURANCE

00:46:57.147 --> 00:46:58.849
THE HIGH DEDUCTIBLES AND COPAYS

00:46:58.916 --> 00:47:00.517
PLUS JOB LOSSES IMPACT THEIR

00:47:00.584 --> 00:47:02.319
ABILITY TO PAY FOR HEALTH CARE.

00:47:02.386 --> 00:47:03.820
SO CONTRACTING CODE COULD BE

00:47:03.887 --> 00:47:06.657
FINANCIALLY DEVASTATING AS WELL

00:47:06.723 --> 00:47:10.527
AS DEADLY. BEFORE THE PANDEMIC

00:47:10.594 --> 00:47:11.528
LEVINE AS HAD BEEN ENJOYING

00:47:11.595 --> 00:47:13.797
SUCCESS ALONG VARIOUS METRICS

00:47:13.864 --> 00:47:15.566
AND THE BROADER ECO SYSTEM OF

00:47:15.632 --> 00:47:16.934
CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY IS

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:18.402
INCREASINGLY TIED TO THEIR

00:47:18.468 --> 00:47:20.370
ECONOMIC WELL BEING. SO WE

00:47:20.437 --> 00:47:22.439
RECOMMEND INSTITUTING POLICIES

00:47:22.506 --> 00:47:23.774
THAT MITIGATE THAT

00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:25.075
DISPROPORTIONATE FINANCIAL

00:47:25.142 --> 00:47:26.610
DAMAGES THAT DAMAGE THAT MEDINA

00:47:26.677 --> 00:47:28.011
SUFFER WITH EVERY ECONOMIC

00:47:28.078 --> 00:47:30.047
DOWNTURN. TO FACILITATE THEIR

00:47:30.113 --> 00:47:31.582
ABILITY TO RECOVER IN THE SHORT

00:47:31.648 --> 00:47:33.517
TERM AND HELP THEM TO REIMAGINE

00:47:33.584 --> 00:47:35.485
OUR FUTURE IN THE LONGER TERM.

00:47:35.552 --> 00:47:36.687
WE SHOULD SUPPORT THAT IN A

00:47:36.753 --> 00:47:37.454
BUSINESS OWNERSHIP AND

ABOUT 27% OF THEIR JOBS. AND WE

00:49:42.212 --> 00:49:44.147
CAN SEE HERE THAT WOMEN ARE-

00:49:44.214 --> 00:49:45.649
CONCENTRATED IN THOSE-

00:49:45.716 --> 00:49:47.884
PARTICULAR INDUSTRIES- AND

THEIR RESEARCH ALSO HAS SHOWN

00:50:02.833 --> 00:50:04.534
THAT ONE LOT NEXT WORKERS BUT

00:50:04.601 --> 00:50:06.903
CUT BACK ON THE PAYROLL- THEY

00:50:06.970 --> 00:50:08.071

FURTHER ECONOMIC SHUT DOWN. AND

COMPARED TO OTHER RACIAL AND

00:50:33.563 --> 00:50:34.898
ETHNIC GROUPS SO THIS

00:50:34.965 --> 00:50:36.032
UNDERSCORES THE IMPORTANCE OF

00:50:36.099 --> 00:50:37.667
EXPANDING ACCESS TO

00:50:37.734 --> 00:50:38.602

POPULATION RATIO IS ANOTHER WAY

00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:52.416
TO MEASURE- THE CURRENT STATE

00:50:52.482 --> 00:50:54.851
OF LABOR MARKET- IN THE SHORT

00:50:54.918 --> 00:50:56.953
RUN TO FIGURE TO YOUR SHOWS

00:50:57.020 --> 00:50:57.721
THAT LATINOS EXPERIENCED A

00:50:57.788 --> 00:50:59.990
SHARP. JOB LOSS IN THE EARLY

00:51:00.056 --> 00:51:01.925
MONTHS OF THE PANDEMIC- EVEN

00:51:01.992 --> 00:51:03.160
THOUGH JOB CREATION HAS

00:51:03.226 --> 00:51:04.628
INCREASED SINCE APRIL LATINOS

00:51:04.694 --> 00:51:06.163
STILL- ARE THE FARTHEST FROM

00:51:06.229 --> 00:51:07.731
RETURNING TO THE PRE PANDEMIC

00:51:07.798 --> 00:51:10.467
LEVELS- AGAIN THE JOB LOSSES

00:51:10.534 --> 00:51:11.701
POSE SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC

00:51:11.768 --> 00:51:15.105
CHALLENGES FOR LATINAS. IN

00:51:15.172 --> 00:51:15.739
TWENTY EIGHTEEN FORTY ONE POINT

00:51:15.806 --> 00:51:17.641
4% OF LATINO MOTHERS WERE THE

00:51:17.707 --> 00:51:20.177
PRIMARY OR SOLE BREADWINNERS

00:51:20.243 --> 00:51:22.012
FOR THEIR FAMILIES COMPARED TO

00:51:22.078 --> 00:51:23.113
THIRTY SEVEN PERCENT. FOR WHITE

00:51:23.180 --> 00:51:24.648
MOTHERS WE ALSO KNOW THAT

00:51:24.714 --> 00:51:26.116
POVERTY RATES FOR LATINOS ARE

00:51:26.183 --> 00:51:27.717
ALMOST DOUBLE THOSE OF WHITES

00:51:27.784 --> 00:51:30.287
IN BOTH THE US AND CALIFORNIA.

00:51:30.353 --> 00:51:32.122
ON IN ADDITION A LOT NEXT ON

00:51:32.189 --> 00:51:34.858
LEE'S EXPERIENCE 265% INCREASE

00:51:34.925 --> 00:51:37.127
IN WEALTH- AS OPTIMISTIC AS WAS

00:51:37.194 --> 00:51:38.862
MENTIONED EARLIER ON THE LOT

00:51:38.929 --> 00:51:40.931
NEXT WHITE GOT FELT VERY LITTLE

00:51:40.997 --> 00:51:43.500
CHANGED VERY LITTLE- IN TWENTY

00:51:43.567 --> 00:51:45.101
NINETEEN. WITH LIVE NEXT

00:51:45.168 --> 00:51:46.536
HOUSEHOLDS STILL HAVINGMUCH

00:51:46.603 --> 00:51:48.405
LOWER LEVELS OF WEALTH COMPARED

00:51:48.472 --> 00:51:50.540
TO WHITE HOUSEHOLDS. A LOT NEXT

DOLLARS IN HIGHLY LIQUID ASSETS

00:51:56.580 --> 00:51:57.581
WHICH ARE COMING FROM CHECKING

00:51:57.647 --> 00:51:59.516
ACCOUNTS SAVINGS ACCOUNTS.

00:51:59.583 --> 00:52:00.484
COMPARED TO EIGHT THOUSAND

00:52:00.550 --> 00:52:02.352
DOLLARS FOR WHITE HOUSEHOLDS SO

00:52:02.419 --> 00:52:03.920
THE COMBINATION OF JOB LOSS

00:52:03.987 --> 00:52:05.755
INCOME LOSS HIGHER POVERTY

00:52:05.822 --> 00:52:07.724

WEALTH AND EMERGENCY SAVINGS

00:52:10.093 --> 00:52:11.228
REALLY PUTS MANY OF THESE

00:52:11.294 --> 00:52:12.863
LATINO BREADWINNERS- AND

00:52:12.929 --> 00:52:20.036

00:52:26.109 --> 00:52:27.444
IN JUST. AND I KEEP. THAT ARE

00:52:27.511 --> 00:52:29.446
ONE ARE FACING THESE CHAU- AN

00:52:29.513 --> 00:52:32.349
EXCITING YEAR SHOWS. THE LABOR

00:52:32.415 --> 00:52:34.885
FORCE FOR. RATE I'M FOR WOMEN

00:52:34.951 --> 00:52:37.387
SO YOU SEEN THAT THE- LET'S USE

00:52:37.454 --> 00:52:38.755
EXPERIENCE A DISPROPORTIONATE

00:52:38.822 --> 00:52:39.823
DROP IN LABOR FORCE

00:52:39.890 --> 00:52:42.425
PARTICIPATION RATES- SENSE OF

00:52:42.492 --> 00:52:44.394
FEBRUARY TWENTY TWENTY OF ABOUT

00:52:44.461 --> 00:52:46.096
6% OR THREE POINT EIGHT

00:52:46.162 --> 00:52:47.831
PERCENTAGE POINTS. ON THE DROP

00:52:47.898 --> 00:52:49.266
IN LABOR FORCE PARTICIPATION

00:52:49.332 --> 00:52:50.667
ISN'T JUST COMING FROM LOST

00:52:50.734 --> 00:52:52.202
JOBS IT'S COMING FROM WOMEN

00:52:52.269 --> 00:52:54.571
ACTUALLY EXITING ON THE LABOR

00:52:54.638 --> 00:52:58.441
MARKET THE LABOR FORCE. SO WE

00:52:58.508 --> 00:53:00.510
CAN SEE HERE THAT- AND THIS

00:53:00.577 --> 00:53:02.679
NEXT ROUND OF LUCK NEXT WORKERS

00:53:02.746 --> 00:53:04.214
ARE LESS LIKELY TO HAVE PAID

00:53:04.281 --> 00:53:07.017
SICK LEAVE IN. OTHER ALSO- LESS

00:53:07.083 --> 00:53:09.085
LIKELY TO BE ABLE TO WORK FROM

00:53:09.152 --> 00:53:10.921
HOME SO THE LACK OF JOB

00:53:10.987 --> 00:53:13.623
FLEXIBILITY- AND BENEFITS MAKES

00:53:13.690 --> 00:53:14.958
IT CHALLENGING FOR A LOT NEXT

00:53:15.025 --> 00:53:16.459
PARENTS TO TAKE TIME OFF FROM

00:53:16.526 --> 00:53:17.360
WORK TO CARE FOR THEIR

00:53:19.396 --> 00:53:21.197
WHO MIGHT BE AT HOME BECAUSE OF

00:53:21.264 --> 00:53:23.066
SCHOOL CLOSURES. SOTHIS

00:53:23.133 --> 00:53:23.667
CREATES AN EVEN BIGGER

00:53:23.733 --> 00:53:25.302
CHALLENGE FOR LARGER HOUSEHOLDS

00:53:25.368 --> 00:53:26.670
OUR SINGER SINGLE PARENT

00:53:26.736 --> 00:53:28.738
HOUSEHOLDS WHAT NEXT HOURS A

00:53:28.805 --> 00:53:30.140
LARGER HOUSEHOLDS WITH CHILDREN

00:53:30.206 --> 00:53:31.708
UNDER EIGHTEEN AND A LARGER

00:53:31.775 --> 00:53:32.842
SHARE OF SINGLE MOTHER

00:53:32.909 --> 00:53:34.244
HOUSEHOLDS COMPARED TO WHITE

00:53:34.311 --> 00:53:35.879
HOUSEHOLDS. I'M AS A RESULT

00:53:35.946 --> 00:53:37.480
SOME LATINOS MAY FACE THE TOUGH

00:53:37.547 --> 00:53:40.183
DECISION OF CHOOSING BETWEEN

00:53:40.250 --> 00:53:42.185
THEIR JOBS AND THEIR FAMILIES.

00:53:42.252 --> 00:53:43.587
MOTHERS HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE

00:53:43.653 --> 00:53:45.288
MORE VULNERABLE THAN FATHERS TO

00:53:45.355 --> 00:53:47.090
THE PANDEMIC DETACHMENT FROM

00:53:47.157 --> 00:53:48.792
THE LABOUR FORCE OUR RECENT

00:53:48.858 --> 00:53:50.427
RESEARCH SHOWS THAT MOTHERS

00:53:50.493 --> 00:53:52.028
WERE MORE LIKELY THAN FATHERS

00:53:52.095 --> 00:53:54.998
TO TAKE A LEAVE- FROM WORK

00:53:55.065 --> 00:53:56.499
DURING THE EARLY PART OF THE

00:53:56.566 --> 00:53:58.468
PANDEMIC. AND SO WE'RE SEEING

00:53:58.535 --> 00:54:00.937
HERE THAT WORKING LAST CHECKING

00:54:01.004 --> 00:54:03.273
TIME OFF IN. PROMOTED LAST ALL

00:54:03.340 --> 00:54:05.108
CONTRIBUTE TO LOWER EARNINGS

00:54:05.175 --> 00:54:06.543
AND WILL INCREASE THE GENDER

00:54:06.610 --> 00:54:07.944
EARNINGS GAP FARTHER FROM WHAT

00:54:08.011 --> 00:54:10.347
WE SIXTEEN ALREADY IT ALSO HAS

00:54:10.413 --> 00:54:11.381
IMPLICATIONS FOR THE OVERALL

00:54:11.448 --> 00:54:13.350
ECONOMY IT'S BEEN ESTIMATED

00:54:13.416 --> 00:54:14.284
THAT MOTHERS LEAVING THE LABOR

00:54:14.351 --> 00:54:16.186
FORCE COULD COST SIXTY FOUR

00:54:16.252 --> 00:54:17.654
POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS PER

00:54:17.721 --> 00:54:20.223
YEAR- IN LOST WAGES AND

00:54:20.290 --> 00:54:22.192
ECONOMIC. ACTIVITY ON THE

00:54:22.258 --> 00:54:23.860
LONGER THAT WOMEN REMAIN OUT OF

00:54:23.927 --> 00:54:25.462
THE LABOR FORCE IT BECOMES MORE

00:54:25.528 --> 00:54:27.530
DIFFICULT OR REENTER TO

00:54:27.597 --> 00:54:28.832
RESEARCH SHOWS THAT INDIVIDUALS

00:54:28.898 --> 00:54:30.634
AND WHEN OUT OF THE LABOR FORCE

00:54:30.700 --> 00:54:31.935

00:54:32.002 --> 00:54:33.970
LESS LIKELY TO BE CALLED BACK

00:54:34.037 --> 00:54:35.772
FOR INTERVIEWS WE SEE THAT THIS

00:54:35.839 --> 00:54:42.812
IS NOT JUST GONNA **** US.

00:54:42.879 --> 00:54:44.080
THANKS AS WELL BUT YOU LOOK

00:54:44.147 --> 00:54:44.648
YOU'RE DESPERATE FIGURE SEE

00:54:44.714 --> 00:54:46.249
THAT AGAIN DO YOU DRAW IN LATE

00:54:46.316 --> 00:54:47.317
FORCE WHICH IS. EVEN AMONG WITH

00:54:47.384 --> 00:54:49.119
NO CHILL. ARE FOR A LOT TO LIKE

00:54:49.185 --> 00:54:50.954
LARA THAN IT IS FOR THOSE THAT

00:54:51.021 --> 00:54:53.790
ACTUALLY HAVE OUR CHILDREN. AND

00:54:53.857 --> 00:54:55.625
INSURANCE ARE JUST SOME POLICY

00:54:55.692 --> 00:54:57.394
RECOMMENDATIONS IT'S NOT CLEAR

00:54:57.460 --> 00:54:59.129
TO DROP A SIGNIFICANT DROP IN

00:54:59.195 --> 00:55:00.397
THE LABOR FORCE PARTICIPATION

00:55:00.463 --> 00:55:02.298
RATE. AMONG LATINOS IS GOING TO

00:55:02.365 --> 00:55:04.367
BE TEMPORARY OR WHETHER WE CALL

00:55:04.434 --> 00:55:05.969
MORE PER MINUTE. THE LONGER

00:55:06.036 --> 00:55:07.303
LATINOS CONTINUE TO REMAIN OF

00:55:07.370 --> 00:55:08.772
THE LABOR FORCE THE GREATER THE

00:55:08.838 --> 00:55:10.306
DANGER THAT THEY WILL

00:55:10.373 --> 00:55:11.875
PERMANENTLY REMAIN OUT OF THE

00:55:11.941 --> 00:55:13.510
LABOR FORCE WHICH CAN HAVE LONG

00:55:13.576 --> 00:55:14.978
TERM IMPLICATIONS. FOR

00:55:15.045 --> 00:55:17.213
HOUSEHOLD INCOME AND EARNINGS

00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:18.481
SO POLICIES THAT PROVIDE

00:55:18.548 --> 00:55:20.150
GREATER SUPPORT FOR AFFORDABLE

00:55:20.216 --> 00:55:21.918
CHILDCARE POLICIES AND EVEN

00:55:21.985 --> 00:55:24.187
CREATE MORE CHILD CARE CENTERS

00:55:24.254 --> 00:55:25.922
BECAUSE WE KNOW. THAT RESEARCH

00:55:25.989 --> 00:55:28.091
HAS SHOWN LOW INCOME AREAS OCT

00:55:28.158 --> 00:55:29.626
FUTURE CHILD CARE CENTERS COULD

00:55:29.693 --> 00:55:31.394
HELP LATINAS MAINTAIN. THEIR

00:55:31.461 --> 00:55:33.129
ATTACHMENT TO THE LABOR FORCE

00:55:33.196 --> 00:55:34.164
AS WE COME OUT OF THIS

00:55:34.230 --> 00:55:36.132
PANDEMIC. IN ADDITION JOB

00:55:36.199 --> 00:55:37.567
PROTECTION POLICY SHOULD BE

00:55:37.634 --> 00:55:39.469
ENHANCED AND EXPANDED TO ALL

00:55:39.536 --> 00:55:41.237

EMPLOYER SIZE IMPORTANT. LABOR

00:55:54.484 --> 00:55:56.086
MARKET DISCRIMINATION AS CAP

00:55:56.152 --> 00:55:57.954
LATINOS AND LOCANE INFLEXIBLE

00:55:58.021 --> 00:56:00.323
JOBS THAT OFFER FEW BENEFITS SO

00:56:00.390 --> 00:56:01.491
EFFORTS SHOULD BE MADE TO

00:56:01.558 --> 00:56:03.893
REDUCE OCCUPATIONAL SEGREGATION

00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:05.361
FOR LATINOS. TRAINING

INVESTMENTS IN HUMAN CAPITAL

00:56:08.331 --> 00:56:09.399
MAY HELP LATINOS MOVING TO

00:56:09.466 --> 00:56:11.267
BETTER PAYING JOBS WITH GREATER

00:56:11.334 --> 00:56:13.436
OPPORTUNITIES FOR FLEXIBLE WORK

00:56:13.503 --> 00:56:15.338
ARRANGEMENTS. ALSO THE LABOR

00:56:15.405 --> 00:56:16.673
MARKET EXPERIENCES I'VE

00:56:16.740 --> 00:56:18.641
DOCUMENTS AND LATINOS MAY ALSO

00:56:18.708 --> 00:56:19.909
BE CONTRIBUTING TO SOME OF THE

00:56:19.976 --> 00:56:21.678
TRENDS THAT WE'VE OBSERVED. SO

00:56:21.745 --> 00:56:23.246
DURING THE FIRST THREE MONTHS

00:56:23.313 --> 00:56:24.848
OF THE PANDEMIC IN CALIFORNIA

00:56:24.914 --> 00:56:26.416
EMPLOYMENT FOR IMMIGRANT WOMEN

00:56:26.483 --> 00:56:29.152
STYLE BY 20% COMPARED TO

00:56:29.219 --> 00:56:30.186
THIRTEEN PERCENT. FOR NON

IMMIGRANT WOMEN AND 9% FOR NON

00:56:32.722 --> 00:56:34.224
IMMIGRANT MAN. SO EXCLUDING

00:56:34.290 --> 00:56:36.259
UNDOCUMENTED LATINOS FROM

00:56:36.326 --> 00:56:42.932
FEDERAL AND STATE SUPPORT.

00:56:42.999 --> 00:56:43.533
PROGRAMS LEAVES THEM AND THEIR

00:56:43.600 --> 00:56:44.934
FAMILIES I MANY WHO ARE PART OF.

00:56:45.001 --> 00:56:46.302
STATUS HOW. WHERE LEAST ONE OF

00:56:46.369 --> 00:56:47.270
MEMBER OF THEIR FAMILY A U. S.

00:56:47.337 --> 00:56:48.638
CITIZEN. AND I'M VERY LONG

00:56:48.705 --> 00:56:50.140
POSITION RESEARCH HAS HUGE NOT.

00:56:50.206 --> 00:56:51.641
A DOC WORKERS AND THEIR

00:56:51.708 --> 00:56:53.977
FAMILIES IN ADDITIONAL ROUNDS

00:56:54.043 --> 00:56:55.678
OF STIMULUS. SHARKS COULD

00:56:55.745 --> 00:56:57.413
RESULT IN A FOURTEEN MILLION

00:56:57.480 --> 00:57:00.116
DOLLAR INCREASE IN OVERALL

00:57:00.183 --> 00:57:01.084
ECONOMIC OUTPUT. FINALLY I

00:57:01.151 --> 00:57:03.052
THINK. I FEEL THE BEST THING WE

00:57:03.119 --> 00:57:06.156
CAN DO FOR LATINOS IS- INCREASE

00:57:06.222 --> 00:57:07.423
THEIR WEALTH. THE WEALTH

00:57:07.490 --> 00:57:08.725
DIFFERENCE AND THE WEALTH

00:57:08.792 --> 00:57:10.760
DISPARITY IS JUST SO STARK

00:57:10.827 --> 00:57:12.328
COMPARED TO EVEN THE WAGE AND

00:57:12.395 --> 00:57:14.330
INCOME DISPARITIES. SO THE

00:57:14.397 --> 00:57:15.732
RACIAL AND ETHNIC GAPS IN

00:57:15.799 --> 00:57:18.134
WEALTH NEED TO BE ADDRESSED

00:57:18.201 --> 00:57:19.969
GREATER ACCESS TO WEALTH ALLOWS

00:57:20.036 --> 00:57:21.571
HOUSEHOLDS TO BETTER WEATHER

00:57:21.638 --> 00:57:23.506
ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS. AND WILL

00:57:23.573 --> 00:57:25.608
ALLOW LATINOS THE RESOURCES TO

00:57:25.675 --> 00:57:26.676
MAKE INVESTMENTS AND THEIR

00:57:26.743 --> 00:57:28.945
HEALTH AND HUMAN CAPITAL AND

00:57:29.012 --> 00:57:30.313
ONE WAY TO DO THIS AS WELL-

00:57:30.380 --> 00:57:31.815
THAT DOCTOR MISSY IS ALREADY

00:57:31.881 --> 00:57:33.917
MENTIONED. HOMEOWNERSHIP BUT

00:57:33.983 --> 00:57:35.251
EVEN MORE IMPORTANT BUSINESS

00:57:35.318 --> 00:57:37.053
OWNERSHIP BUSINESS OWNERSHIP

00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:39.122
ENTREPRENEURSHIP COULD PROVIDE

00:57:39.189 --> 00:57:40.857
LATINAS WITHIN OPPORTUNITY FOR

00:57:40.924 --> 00:57:42.692
MORE FLEXIBLE WORK ARRANGEMENTS

00:57:42.759 --> 00:57:44.360
AS WELL AS A WAY TO BUILD AND

00:57:44.427 --> 00:57:46.896
ACCUMLATE WEALTH. SO PROGRAMS

00:58:01.010 --> 00:58:02.178
ONLY BUSINESS STARTER SHOCKED

00:58:02.245 --> 00:58:03.913

01:10:01.330 --> 01:10:04.667
IN THE STATE WITH SMALL

01:10:04.733 --> 01:10:05.201
BUSINESSES WOULD LOVE YOUR

01:10:05.267 --> 01:10:08.170
THOUGHTS ON THAT. I'M YEAH I

01:10:08.237 --> 01:10:10.172
THINK PART OF THE PROBLEM WITH

01:10:10.239 --> 01:10:12.575
WITH SORT OF LOOKING AT. LATINO

01:10:12.641 --> 01:10:14.443

COLLECTION AND- AND SO YOU KNOW

01:10:16.812 --> 01:10:18.213
A LOT OF THE LARGE DATA SETS

01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:19.748
ARE PICKING UP. SORT OF

01:10:19.815 --> 01:10:23.118
INFORMATION ABOUT SORT OF-

01:10:23.185 --> 01:10:25.621
LARGER FIRMS- BUT THIS SORT OF

01:10:25.688 --> 01:10:27.389
YOU KNOW STOREFRONTS AND A LOT

01:10:27.456 --> 01:10:28.524
OF THE RESEARCH THAT I'VE DONE

01:10:28.591 --> 01:10:30.526
HAS BEEN ON- LOOKING AT LATINO

01:10:30.593 --> 01:10:33.128
STOREFRONTS- IS SOMETHING THAT

01:10:33.195 --> 01:10:34.096
YOU WOULD NEED TO DO IN TERMS

01:10:34.163 --> 01:10:36.065
OF LIKE A SURVEY AND REALLY

01:10:36.131 --> 01:10:37.499
SORT OF TRACKING- THESE

01:10:37.566 --> 01:10:38.834
BUSINESS OWNERS AND I THINK

01:10:38.901 --> 01:10:40.102
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT. WE DON'T

01:10:40.169 --> 01:10:42.538
NORMALLY DO AND DOCTOR NEEDS TO

01:10:42.605 --> 01:10:44.273
BE MORE FINDING IN TERMS OF

01:10:44.340 --> 01:10:45.908
LONGITUDINAL SURVEYS THAT

01:10:45.975 --> 01:10:47.176
TRACKED THESE BUSINES OWNERS

01:10:47.242 --> 01:10:49.011
OVER TIME PARTICULARLY SMALLER

01:10:49.078 --> 01:10:51.647
BUSINESSES- IN TERMS OF SEEING

01:10:51.714 --> 01:10:53.782
THEIR PROGRESS- I THINK YOU'RE

01:10:53.849 --> 01:10:55.117
RIGHT AND IN TERMS OF MAKING

01:10:55.184 --> 01:10:57.286
SURE THAT THEY HAVE. ACCESS TO

01:10:57.353 --> 01:10:59.488
THE FUNDS- AND MAKING SURE THAT

01:10:59.555 --> 01:11:01.357
IT IS ADDRESSING KIND OF SOME

01:11:01.423 --> 01:11:02.524
OF THEIR NEEDS ONE OF THE

01:11:02.591 --> 01:11:04.226
THINGS I ALSO THAT I WOULD SA

01:11:04.293 --> 01:11:05.361
IS IT WHEN IT COMES TO

01:11:05.427 --> 01:11:07.563
ENTREPRENEURSHIP. IS IT'S

01:11:07.630 --> 01:11:09.031
REALLY ABOUT SORT OF ACCESS TO

01:11:09.098 --> 01:11:11.867
MARKETS ZERO AND SO YOU KNOW IF

01:11:11.934 --> 01:11:12.968
WE LOOK AT SORT OF THE

01:11:13.035 --> 01:11:14.837
TECHNOLOGICAL DIVIDE THAT WE'VE

01:11:14.903 --> 01:11:17.339
ALSO SEEN HERE- MANY SMALL

01:11:17.406 --> 01:11:19.074
BUSINESS OWNERS DON'T HAVE

01:11:19.141 --> 01:11:21.210
ACCESS TO THE SAME TECHNOLOGY

01:11:21.276 --> 01:11:23.779
AS LARGER BUSINESSES. OR THE

01:11:23.846 --> 01:11:25.314
SAME ACCESS TO YOU KNOW USING

01:11:25.381 --> 01:11:26.882
TECHNOLOGY AS A WAY TO

01:11:26.949 --> 01:11:29.551
ADVERTISE- BUT SMALL TOOLS WE

01:11:29.618 --> 01:11:31.120
SEE LENA LET LET YOU KNOW FOR

01:11:31.186 --> 01:11:32.655
EXAMPLE ARE ARE MORE LIKELY TO

01:11:32.721 --> 01:11:34.289
ON THE PHONE AND USE THAT PHONE

01:11:34.356 --> 01:11:35.591
FOR THEIR BUSINESS PURPOSES AND

01:11:35.658 --> 01:11:37.593
SO. THINKING ABOUT ALSO NOT

01:11:37.660 --> 01:11:39.595
JUST SORT OF PROVIDING START UP

01:11:39.662 --> 01:11:41.864
FUNDS AND CAPITAL FINANCIAL

01:11:41.930 --> 01:11:43.365
CAPITAL TO THESE BUSINESSES BUT

01:11:43.432 --> 01:11:44.333
REALLY HOPING THAT I THINK

01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:46.502
THINK THROUGH. THEIR BUSINESS

01:11:46.568 --> 01:11:48.203
STRATEGIES HOW CAN THEY REACH A

01:11:48.270 --> 01:11:50.773
WIDER MARKET- HOW CAN THEY USE

01:11:50.839 --> 01:11:52.741
TECHNOLOGY IN THE INTERNET TO

01:11:52.808 --> 01:11:54.109
REACH OUT WIDER MARKET WE'VE

01:11:54.176 --> 01:11:55.411
SEEN A LOT OF BUSINESSES BE

01:11:55.477 --> 01:11:58.781
SUCCESSFUL NOT AREA- BUT- BUT

01:11:58.847 --> 01:12:00.482
THOSE THAT LACK THE TECHNOLOGY

01:12:00.549 --> 01:12:01.684
OR THE KNOW HOW ARE ABLE TO

01:12:01.750 --> 01:12:06.855
SORT OF REAP THOSE BENEFITS.

01:12:06.922 --> 01:12:07.690
SO- I THINK THESE ARE THINGS

01:12:07.756 --> 01:12:08.290
YOU KNOW ARE REALLY IMPORTANT

01:12:08.357 --> 01:12:09.258
BUT I THINK TRACKING THESE

01:12:09.324 --> 01:12:11.160
THESE BUSINESS ARE. AND SO THAT

01:12:11.226 --> 01:12:13.295
IS OFTEN LACKING. AND SO WE

01:12:13.362 --> 01:12:15.364
REALLY DON'T KNOW FOR EXAMPLE%

01:12:15.431 --> 01:12:17.132
YOU KNOW HOW SUCCESSFUL ARE

01:12:17.199 --> 01:12:18.367
SOME OF THESE INTERVENTION

01:12:18.434 --> 01:12:20.002
PROGRAMS- OR IF THEY'RE EVEN

01:12:20.069 --> 01:12:22.438
TARGETING THE RIGHT THINGS ON

01:12:22.504 --> 01:12:23.005
IN TERMS OF. OF

01:12:23.072 --> 01:12:24.840
ENTREPRENEURSHIP. BUT IT'S

01:12:24.907 --> 01:12:26.008
DEFINITELY AN OPPORTUNITY FOR

01:12:26.075 --> 01:12:28.410
THEM TO COME OUT- ON THE

01:12:28.477 --> 01:12:30.279
STRONGER AND HERE IN TERMS OF

01:12:30.345 --> 01:12:31.547

A WAY TO HAVE JOB FLEXIBILITY

01:12:36.719 --> 01:12:38.253
SO. I THINK WE REALLY NEED TO

01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:39.922
MAKE SURE WE NOW WHETHER THOSE

01:12:39.988 --> 01:12:42.558

01:17:03.151 --> 01:17:04.720
AS WOMEN WERE LOSING THEIR JOBS

01:17:04.786 --> 01:17:06.688
IT WAS THE IMMIGRANTS WHO LOST

01:17:06.755 --> 01:17:08.123
THE GREATEST NUMBER OF

01:17:08.190 --> 01:17:10.192
JOBSEEKERS PERCENTAGE THEY WERE

01:17:10.258 --> 01:17:11.226
THE ONES THAT WERE THE MOST

01:17:11.293 --> 01:17:12.594
IMPACTED BY THE JOB LOSSES

01:17:12.661 --> 01:17:14.363
IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE PANDEMIC

01:17:14.429 --> 01:17:15.297
STARTED EACH AND THOSE ARE THE

01:17:15.364 --> 01:17:17.733
SAME. PEOPLE WHO ALSO DID NOT

01:17:17.799 --> 01:17:19.267
HAVE ACCESS THEY DIDN'T HAVE

01:17:19.334 --> 01:17:21.303
THE SAFETY NET BUT OTHERS ARE

01:17:21.370 --> 01:17:23.372
OTHERS DEBT SO THEY DIDN'T HAVE

01:17:23.438 --> 01:17:23.839
ACCESS TO UNEMPLOYMENT

01:17:23.905 --> 01:17:26.008
INSURANCE- AND THEY DIDN'T HAVE

01:17:26.074 --> 01:17:28.977
ACCESS TO- TO- THE STIMULUS

01:17:29.044 --> 01:17:30.612
MONIES SO I MEAN CAN YOU

01:17:30.679 --> 01:17:33.048
IMAGINE IS. IT AS AS MISTRUST

01:17:33.115 --> 01:17:33.982
AND YOU LOOK WHICH WAS WITH

01:17:34.049 --> 01:17:35.617
SPEAKING AND MY HEART GOES OUT

01:17:35.684 --> 01:17:39.354
TO YOU BUT CAN YOU IMAGINE IF

01:17:39.421 --> 01:17:41.456
YOU DIDN'T HAVE. YOUR CHECK ON

01:17:41.523 --> 01:17:42.791
TOP OF EVERY ELSE SO I THINK

01:17:42.858 --> 01:17:44.426
IT'S EXTREMELY CRUCIAL AS

01:17:44.493 --> 01:17:45.894
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT GETTING

01:17:45.961 --> 01:17:47.562
ACCESS TO THOSE- THE EXTENT I

01:17:47.629 --> 01:17:49.297
TENS- YOU KNOW WE NEED TO BE

01:17:49.364 --> 01:17:52.434
ABLE TO BE AT REACHING OUT. TO

01:17:52.501 --> 01:17:54.069
THE PEOPLE WHO ALREADY DO

01:17:54.136 --> 01:17:55.470
QUALIFY IN MAKING SURE THAT

01:17:55.537 --> 01:17:58.607
THEY CAN GET THOSE. THOSE THAT

01:17:58.673 --> 01:18:01.443
THAT. AT STATUS SO THAT THEY

01:18:01.510 --> 01:18:03.545
CAN GET ACCESS TO DUE TO THE

01:18:03.612 --> 01:18:05.347
SAFETY NET BENEFITS. AND THEN

01:18:05.414 --> 01:18:06.815
ALSO WHEN YOU JUST CONSIDER YOU

01:18:06.882 --> 01:18:08.550
KNOW EXPANDING. WHO DOES

01:18:08.617 --> 01:18:11.253
QUALIFY FOR THAT- SO YOU KNOW

01:18:11.319 --> 01:18:12.921
THERE ARE THERE ARE SO MANY

01:18:12.988 --> 01:18:15.624
LEVELS AND WE NEED- IN IN I

01:18:15.690 --> 01:18:16.391
KNOW MY RESEARCH WE'VE

01:18:16.458 --> 01:18:18.326
IDENTIFIED THAT THERE ARE LIKE

01:18:18.393 --> 01:18:19.428
THE S. WE'VE DONE EXTREMELY

01:18:19.494 --> 01:18:22.030
WELL- WHO HAVE NOT BEEN. HEARD

01:18:22.097 --> 01:18:24.933
AS MUCH BY THE PANDEMICS ARE A

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.402
FAX AND- AND THEN THERE ARE

01:18:27.469 --> 01:18:29.304
THOSE IN THE MIDDLE WHO ARE YOU

01:18:29.371 --> 01:18:31.940
KNOW OR- YOU KNOW. HAVING TO

01:18:32.007 --> 01:18:34.109
MAKE MAYBE A FEW CHANGES BUT

01:18:34.176 --> 01:18:35.544
STILL NOT IMPACTED WE'RE WITH

01:18:35.610 --> 01:18:37.212
THEM THERE'S JUST TREMENDOUS.

01:18:37.279 --> 01:18:40.015
PORTION OF THE- POPULATION IS

01:18:40.082 --> 01:18:41.116
WITH OURS ALSO I MEAN IT'S A

01:18:41.183 --> 01:18:43.652
HUGE NUMBER WHO ARE AFFECTING

01:18:43.718 --> 01:18:45.253
THE BOTTOM LINE FOR THE ENTIRE

01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:47.556
CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY. SO WHAT

01:18:47.622 --> 01:18:48.957
ARE WE DOING TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:18:49.024 --> 01:18:51.726
THOSE WOMEN WHO ARE YOU KNOW. I

01:18:51.793 --> 01:18:53.495
THINK THAT ARE SORT OF MESSAGE

01:18:53.562 --> 01:18:55.330
THEY'RE ALREADY RESPONSIBLE FOR

01:18:55.397 --> 01:18:56.665
FEEDING US THEY'RE ALREADY

01:18:56.731 --> 01:18:58.266
RESPONSIBLE NOW FOR TEACHING

01:18:58.333 --> 01:19:00.335
THEIR CHILDREN SO A SO THE FACT

01:19:00.402 --> 01:19:07.109
THAT WE ARE NOT DOING MORRIS.

01:19:07.175 --> 01:19:07.709
IS FRANKLY TOWN CONSCIONABLE.

01:19:07.776 --> 01:19:10.112
IF I COULD I OPPOSE. FOR MIX

01:19:10.178 --> 01:19:11.113
THE TWO PANELS BUT OFTENTIMES

01:19:11.179 --> 01:19:13.381
BOTH THE ACT AND HEALTH IMPACTS

01:19:13.448 --> 01:19:14.616
ARE TIED THE SOCIAL

01:19:14.683 --> 01:19:15.917
DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH THAT

01:19:15.984 --> 01:19:18.053
WERE SPOKEN ABOUT. AND THEN

01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:20.088
THAT I JUST WANT TO UPLIFT THE

01:19:20.155 --> 01:19:21.556
COMMENT FROM THE TULARE COUNTY

01:19:21.623 --> 01:19:23.525
RESIDENT WHO SAID. RIGHT NOW WE

01:19:23.592 --> 01:19:25.527

VIRUS. FOR THOSE WHO ARE HAVING

01:19:27.829 --> 01:19:29.197
TO MAKE THOSE TOUGH CHOICES

01:19:29.264 --> 01:19:31.466
ABOUT MAKING. AND PUTTING FOOD

01:19:31.533 --> 01:19:33.502
ON THE ROUND TABLE THAT THOSE

01:19:33.568 --> 01:19:35.170
CHOICES BETWEEN ECONOMICS AND

01:19:35.237 --> 01:19:37.806
HEALTH ARE TIED. AND SO WE HAVE

01:19:37.873 --> 01:19:38.640

01:19:38.707 --> 01:19:40.575
PROVIDING SOLUTIONS SO WE CAN

01:19:40.642 --> 01:19:42.511

01:22:13.061 --> 01:22:14.062
THE SMALL BUSINESS OF THE NEED

WHO WHO. REFERRED TO. YOU KNOW

01:22:49.331 --> 01:22:50.165
IF YOU LOOK AT THE CALL THE

01:22:50.231 --> 01:22:51.333
DEATH RATES AMONG THE HIGHEST

01:22:51.399 --> 01:22:52.867
OUR- COOKS SO THOSE ARE

WORKING. FAST FOOD RESTAURANTS

01:22:55.036 --> 01:22:55.770

SO MANY OF US. TO BE ABLE TO

01:22:57.706 --> 01:22:59.507
STAY HOME. FARMWORKERS ALSO

01:22:59.574 --> 01:23:04.179
RIGHT UP THERE AS WELL. AND SO

01:23:04.245 --> 01:23:04.813

SOMETHING THAT. I'M NOT PRESENT

01:23:09.517 --> 01:23:11.753
ROMERO MADE REFERENCE TO. BUT

01:23:11.820 --> 01:23:14.389
SHE ALSO MADE REFERENCE-

01:23:14.456 --> 01:23:15.857
TOWARDS THE END OF OUR COMMENTS

01:23:15.924 --> 01:23:17.792
REGARDING. THE CHANGING

01:23:17.859 --> 01:23:19.828
VACCINATION RULES. AND THE

01:23:19.894 --> 01:23:21.563
CONFUSION IT CREATES AND HOW

01:23:21.629 --> 01:23:24.332
CAN INTENSELY LEAVE PEOPLE OUT.

01:23:24.399 --> 01:23:27.569
AND SO I DON'T KNOW IF- IS

01:23:27.635 --> 01:23:28.803
PRESIDENT OF ROMERO WOULD LIKE

01:23:28.870 --> 01:23:30.238
TO. COMMENT ON THAT BCAUSE I

01:23:30.305 --> 01:23:31.639
ALSO HAVE GREAT CONCERNS ABOUT

01:23:31.706 --> 01:23:33.675
THAT AS WE CHANGE THE RULES.

01:23:33.742 --> 01:23:35.076
THAT WERE NOT ACTUALLY GETTING

01:23:35.143 --> 01:23:36.644
THE AND WE DO KNOW. THAT

01:23:36.711 --> 01:23:38.179
FARMERS NEED TO GET BACK SENATE

01:23:38.246 --> 01:23:39.280
THEY'RE THE ONES THAT ARE DYING

01:23:39.347 --> 01:23:40.482
THEY'RE THE ONES THAT ARE AGAIN

01:23:40.548 --> 01:23:43.151
ARE A CENTRAL FOR ALL OF US.

01:23:43.218 --> 01:23:44.786
AND SO ARE THERE ANY THOUGHTS

01:23:44.853 --> 01:23:46.488
NOW THAT THESE TOOLS AND CHANGE

01:23:46.554 --> 01:23:48.456
WHAT WE CAN DO TO ENSURE

01:23:48.523 --> 01:23:49.758
ESPECIALLY THOSE LIKE YOU KNOW

01:23:49.824 --> 01:23:51.593
WE HAVE OUR- OUR CULTURE OF.

01:23:51.659 --> 01:23:53.528
SURVEILLANCE WE HAVE SOME

01:23:53.595 --> 01:23:54.429
ARAMBULA ANOTHER IS THAT THE

01:23:54.496 --> 01:23:55.697
WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH OUR

01:23:55.764 --> 01:23:57.799
FARMWORKERS. AND SO IF THERE'S

01:23:57.866 --> 01:23:59.267
ANY FURTHER THOUGHT ON THAT.

01:23:59.334 --> 01:24:01.069
COMMENT THAT WAS MADE ON HOW WE

01:24:01.136 --> 01:24:02.237
CAN MAKE SURE THE VACCINES ARE

NOT REALLY GOING TO HELP AND I

01:27:07.822 --> 01:27:08.723

ABOUT THIS. AS AN OPPORTUNITY

01:27:10.592 --> 01:27:12.427

01:27:22.971 --> 01:27:23.571
SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY

01:27:23.638 --> 01:27:25.440

SEGREGATION. THAT IS VERY MUCH

01:27:30.645 --> 01:27:32.680
AGAIN ALSO YOU KNOW BECAUSE OF

01:27:32.747 --> 01:27:33.881
DISCRIMINATION IN THE LABOR

MARKET- BUT I THINK WE WANT TO

01:27:35.650 --> 01:27:37.185
THINK ABOUT HOW DO WE REDUCE

01:27:37.251 --> 01:27:39.087
STOCKS SEGREGATION SO THAT. AS

01:27:39.153 --> 01:27:40.288

OCCUPATIONS ARE TO KEEP GETTING

01:27:46.828 --> 01:27:47.996

BIGGER ABOUT. YOU KNOW ME

01:27:49.464 --> 01:27:51.099

01:30:30.591 --> 01:30:31.726
LOOK AT ONE OF MY BIGGEST

01:30:31.793 --> 01:30:33.494
PRIORITIES WHICH IS CHILD CARE

01:30:33.561 --> 01:30:34.962
AND ACCESS TO QUALITY

01:30:35.029 --> 01:30:37.165
PRESCHOOL. WE HAVE TO ENSURE

01:30:37.231 --> 01:30:38.866
THAT THE LATINO WORK FORCE HAS

01:30:38.933 --> 01:30:40.468
ACCESS TO TOP QUALITY CHILD

01:30:40.535 --> 01:30:41.903
CARE BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO

01:30:41.969 --> 01:30:43.871
RECOGNIZE THAT THEY ARE THE

01:30:43.938 --> 01:30:46.040
PROVIDERS AS WELL THEY'RE SMALL

01:30:46.107 --> 01:30:47.809
BUSINESS OWNERS. THIS INDUSTRY

IS LOOKING AT LOSING A THIRD TO

01:30:50.244 --> 01:30:52.180
HALF OF THIS INDUSTRY AND THESE

ARE NOT THE NOT BUSINESS

01:30:52.780 --> 01:30:55.650

WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE

01:30:59.387 --> 01:31:00.254
THE SECOND QUESTION WHEN I'M

01:31:00.321 --> 01:31:02.790
OPPOSE HERE. IS WHAT CAN WE BE

01:31:22.743 --> 01:31:24.078
OF THIS INFORMATION. WHAT

01:31:24.145 --> 01:31:25.112
PERCENTAGE OF THE LEADING A

01:31:25.179 --> 01:31:27.615
BUSINESS OWNERS R. S. CERT

01:31:27.682 --> 01:31:29.684
RECEIVE GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS

01:31:29.750 --> 01:31:31.853
AND HOW CAN WE HELP THEM TO BE

01:31:31.919 --> 01:31:35.756
MORE COMPETITIVE ESPECIALLY IN

01:31:35.823 --> 01:31:42.997
THEIR START UP PHASES. THANKS

01:31:43.064 --> 01:31:44.565
SO REAL QUICK BEFORE I GO ON

01:31:44.632 --> 01:31:45.967
CLARIFY I WILL I WAS IN THIS IS

01:31:46.033 --> 01:31:47.435
HARDLY SEEN PREVIOUS COMMENT

01:31:47.501 --> 01:31:49.637
THAT THOSE JOBS WERE BAD. YES

01:31:49.704 --> 01:31:51.205
THERE ARE GREAT JOBS I WAS JUST

01:31:51.272 --> 01:31:53.107
SAYING IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO

01:31:53.174 --> 01:31:53.975
STILL REACH THINK ABOUT

01:31:54.041 --> 01:31:56.711
RETRAINING AND SEE HOW WE COULD

01:31:56.777 --> 01:31:58.145
MOVE THOSE THAT DON'T HAVE

01:31:58.212 --> 01:32:00.281
THOSE UNIONIZED JOBS AND DON'T

01:32:00.348 --> 01:32:02.617
HAVE THOSE. JOBS WITH BENEFITS

01:32:02.683 --> 01:32:04.418
FOR IT- GOING BACK TO YOUR

01:32:04.485 --> 01:32:04.752
QUESTION ABOUT

01:32:04.819 --> 01:32:07.688
ENTREPRENEURSHIP- I THINK YOU

01:32:07.755 --> 01:32:09.490
KNOW IN TERMS OF YOUR FINANCIAL

01:32:09.557 --> 01:32:10.758
LITERACY I THINK THAT'S

01:32:10.825 --> 01:32:12.660
IMPORTANT. I THINK PARTNERING

01:32:12.727 --> 01:32:14.128
YOU KNOW WITH LOCAL BANKS I

01:32:14.195 --> 01:32:15.997
THINK GETTING LOCAL BANKS TO

01:32:16.063 --> 01:32:18.532
TAKE. A BIGGER ROLE IN IN

01:32:18.599 --> 01:32:19.567
PREDOMINANTLY LATINO

01:32:19.634 --> 01:32:21.102
COMMUNITIES ARE LOW INCOME

01:32:21.168 --> 01:32:22.870
COMMUNITIES AND STRENGTHENING

01:32:22.937 --> 01:32:24.939
THOSE PARTNERSHIPS CAN CAN BE A

01:32:25.006 --> 01:32:26.307
WAY TO INCREASE THAT FINANCIAL

01:32:26.374 --> 01:32:29.076
LITERACY- I THINK IN TERMS OF.

01:32:29.143 --> 01:32:31.279
YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW ACTUALLY

01:32:31.345 --> 01:32:32.513
TO BE HONEST ANSWER TO THE

01:32:32.580 --> 01:32:34.415
QUESTION HOW MANY OF THEM- ARE

01:32:34.482 --> 01:32:36.550
ARE OF THE- SMALL BUSINESS

01:32:36.617 --> 01:32:38.386
ASSOCIATION R RECEIVE

01:32:38.452 --> 01:32:40.288
GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS- I DON'T

01:32:40.354 --> 01:32:41.389
ACTUALLY HAVE THAT DONE UP ON

01:32:41.455 --> 01:32:43.724
HIM AND- BUT I THINK IT'S VERY

01:32:43.791 --> 01:32:44.792
IMPORTANT CHIU CHOI KIND OF

01:32:44.859 --> 01:32:46.594
SUPPORT. DOES ENTREPRENEURIAL

01:32:46.661 --> 01:32:48.329
EFFORTS AND I THINK THAT'S

01:32:48.396 --> 01:32:50.197
SOMETHING THAT AGAIN YOU KNOW

01:32:50.264 --> 01:32:51.666
THE WORKING WITH THOSE LOCAL

01:32:51.732 --> 01:32:53.868
ORGANIZATIONS TO FIND. IN A

01:32:53.935 --> 01:32:55.169
WAYS WHERE THEY CAN CONNECT TO

01:32:55.236 --> 01:32:56.637
REALLY SEE WHAT THE STRUGGLES

01:32:56.704 --> 01:33:00.141
OF LATINO BUSINESS OWNERS ARE-

01:33:00.207 --> 01:33:01.475
I THINK THERE IS AGAIN THE BIG

01:33:01.542 --> 01:33:03.511
ACCESS TO FINANCIAL CAPITAL IS

01:33:03.577 --> 01:33:05.379
DISCRIMINATION THAT THEY FACED

01:33:05.446 --> 01:33:07.348
WHEN THEY'RE LYING- THERE IS

01:33:07.415 --> 01:33:09.583
YOU KNOW I'M ALSO THEY DON'T.

01:33:09.650 --> 01:33:10.985
FEEL NECESSARILY COMFORTABLE.

01:33:11.052 --> 01:33:12.453
WORKING WITH THE BANKS BECAUSE

01:33:12.520 --> 01:33:13.921
BANKS SOMETIMES PLAY A VERY

01:33:13.988 --> 01:33:15.723
SMALL ROLE IN OUR COMMUNITY. SO

01:33:15.790 --> 01:33:17.158
INCREASING THAT RELATIONSHIP

01:33:17.224 --> 01:33:18.592
WITH LOCAL BANKS COULD SORT OF

01:33:18.659 --> 01:33:20.695
INCREASE TRUST AND COULD LEAD

01:33:20.761 --> 01:33:22.363
TO MORE OPPORTUNITIES ON AND

01:33:22.430 --> 01:33:29.470
ACCESS. TO FINANCIAL CAPITAL.

01:33:29.537 --> 01:33:31.372
IF I COULD JUST ADD TO THE LOOK.

01:33:31.439 --> 01:33:35.876
COMMENTS HOPE- I DID US. FOCUS

01:33:35.943 --> 01:33:38.479
GROUP STUDY HOPE WERE I. ENTER.

01:33:38.546 --> 01:33:41.415

01:33:41.482 --> 01:33:42.483

THE STATE AND WE DID FIND

INFORMATION TO GET EDUCATED

01:34:05.139 --> 01:34:07.508
ABOUT THESE ISSUES BUT IT MIGHT

01:34:07.575 --> 01:34:09.110
BE ACROSS TOWN SO THEY'RE IN

01:34:09.176 --> 01:34:10.444

THAT CAN BE CHALLENGING IN

01:34:36.003 --> 01:34:37.038

01:38:17.625 --> 01:38:19.026
CALIFORNIANS HAVE TESTED

01:38:19.093 --> 01:38:20.794
POSITIVE FOR COLBERT NINETEEN.

01:38:20.861 --> 01:38:23.130
AND OVER THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND

01:38:23.197 --> 01:38:23.797
PEOPLE HAVE DIED DUE TO THE

01:38:23.864 --> 01:38:26.333
VIRUS. THESE ARE FAMILY MEMBERS

01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:28.769
FRIENDS FRONTLINE WORKERS AND

01:38:28.836 --> 01:38:30.537
MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITIES WHO

01:38:30.604 --> 01:38:32.473
ARE GETTING SICK AND ARE DYING.

01:38:32.539 --> 01:38:34.541
THIS IS A DEVASTATING LOSS AND

01:38:34.608 --> 01:38:36.110
UNFORTUNATELY IT'S NOT THE ONLY

01:38:36.176 --> 01:38:37.945
DISPARITIES FACING PEOPLE OF

01:38:38.012 --> 01:38:40.114
COLOR AT MID AMID THE PANDEMIC.

01:38:40.180 --> 01:38:41.715
AS YOU ALL KNOW OR HAVE HEARD

01:38:41.782 --> 01:38:42.850
BY NOW THE VIRUS IS

01:38:42.916 --> 01:38:44.251
DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTING

01:38:44.318 --> 01:38:46.320
COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. LET THE

01:38:46.387 --> 01:38:47.388
NEXT CALIFORNIANS ARE

01:38:47.454 --> 01:38:49.123
ESPECIALLY HARD HIT. THE

01:38:49.189 --> 01:38:51.225
ACCOUNT FOR NEARLY 55% OF

01:38:51.292 --> 01:38:54.094
CASES. IN 46% OF DEATHS YET

01:38:54.161 --> 01:38:57.531
THEY REPRESENT JUST AROUND 39%

01:38:57.598 --> 01:38:59.933
OF THE STATE'S POPULATION. I'M

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:00.901
GOING TO SHOW YOU ALSO THE

01:39:00.968 --> 01:39:02.603
CHARTS MY COLLEAGUE MONICA

01:39:02.670 --> 01:39:04.838
DOUGLAS AND I HAVE PUT TOGETHER

01:39:04.905 --> 01:39:07.708
HI I LIKE THESE RACIAL. THE

01:39:07.775 --> 01:39:09.543
DATA ABOUT A WEEK OLD BUT WILL

01:39:09.610 --> 01:39:11.478
STILL HELP US TO UNDERSTAND THE

01:39:11.545 --> 01:39:14.014
IMPACT ON COMMUNITIES OF COLOR-

01:39:14.081 --> 01:39:24.291
DILLON FULL. THE UP. WE HAVE AN

01:39:24.358 --> 01:39:25.526
APPOINTMENT WE'VE BEEN HAVING

01:39:25.592 --> 01:39:29.029
PROBLEMS SEEN CHARTS SO YOU MAY

01:39:29.096 --> 01:39:31.565
HAVE TO JUST TALK US THROUGH IT.

01:39:31.632 --> 01:39:36.370
IF THAT'S POSSIBLE NO PROBLEM.

01:39:36.437 --> 01:39:42.910
I THINK I AM THE- CAN YOU ALL.

01:39:42.976 --> 01:39:44.511
NOW OKAY GREAT I THINK THE

01:39:44.578 --> 01:39:47.381
NODDING HEADS. OKAY SO THIS

01:39:47.448 --> 01:39:49.483
CHART SHOWS COPA NINETY IN CASE

01:39:49.550 --> 01:39:51.218
RATES BY RACE ETHNICITY THAT

01:39:51.285 --> 01:39:53.187
ARE ADJUSTED FOR AGE AS YOU CAN

01:39:53.253 --> 01:39:56.790
SEE A NATIVE HAWAIIAN AND OTHER-PACIFIC ISLANDER CALIFORNIANS

01:39:56.857 --> 01:39:58.592
HAVE THE HIGHEST RATE OF COVERT

01:39:58.659 --> 01:40:00.294
NINETEEN INFECTIONS FOLLOWED BY

01:40:00.361 --> 01:40:02.162
A LOT NEXT CALIFORNIANS THERE

01:40:02.229 --> 01:40:03.630
ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT FACTORS

01:40:03.697 --> 01:40:05.299
FOR WHY RECINE THIS SOME PEOPLE

01:40:05.366 --> 01:40:06.700
OF COLOR HAVE HIGHER RISK OF

01:40:06.767 --> 01:40:08.135
INFECTION PARTLY BECAUSE THEY

01:40:08.202 --> 01:40:09.136
ARE MORE LIKELY TO WORK IN

01:40:09.203 --> 01:40:10.938
ESSENTIAL SERVICES. LIVE IN

01:40:11.004 --> 01:40:12.840
MULTI GENERATIONAL HOMES AND

01:40:12.906 --> 01:40:14.341
LACK ACCESS TO WORK BETTER

01:40:14.408 --> 01:40:17.177
THAT'S THAT ALLOWED ME TO STAY

01:40:17.244 --> 01:40:20.681
HOME IF THEY'RE SICK. THIS NEXT

01:40:20.748 --> 01:40:22.349
CHART SHOWS CODE NINETY THREE

01:40:22.416 --> 01:40:24.184
CALORIES BY RACE ETHNICITY THAT

01:40:24.251 --> 01:40:26.153
ARE ALSO ADJUSTED FOR AGE. JUST

01:40:26.220 --> 01:40:28.255
AS YOU SAW IN THE CASE RATES

01:40:28.322 --> 01:40:29.790
RACIAL DISPARITIES ARE APPARENT

01:40:29.857 --> 01:40:31.759
IN KOBE NINETEEN DEATH RATES.

01:40:31.825 --> 01:40:33.460
YOU COULD SEE THAT LATIN NEXT

01:40:33.527 --> 01:40:35.162
NEED OF HAWAIIAN AND OTHER

01:40:35.229 --> 01:40:37.064
PACIFIC ISLANDER AND BLACK

01:40:37.131 --> 01:40:38.665
CALIFORNIANS EXPERIENCE THE

01:40:38.732 --> 01:40:40.834
HIGHEST RATES OF DEATH DUE TO

01:40:40.901 --> 01:40:42.202
CULVERT NINETEEN. THESE

01:40:42.269 --> 01:40:43.203
DISPARITIES ARE ALARMING

01:40:43.270 --> 01:40:44.671
CONSIDERING THAT THE LOT NEXT

01:40:44.738 --> 01:40:46.240
POPULATION IS GENERALLY YOUNGER

01:40:46.306 --> 01:40:47.307
THAN SOME OF THE OTHER

01:40:47.374 --> 01:40:48.675
DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS YEAH ARE

01:40:48.742 --> 01:40:50.277
DYING FROM COVERT NINETEEN AT

01:40:50.344 --> 01:40:52.379
SUCH HIGH RATES. AND T'S

01:40:52.446 --> 01:40:53.580
IMPORTANT TO TAKE AGE INTO

01:40:53.647 --> 01:40:55.215
CONSIDERATION BECAUSE THE RISK

01:40:55.282 --> 01:40:56.383
FOR SEVERE ILLNESS AND EVEN

01:40:56.450 --> 01:40:58.218
DEATH FROM COVERT NINETEEN

01:40:58.285 --> 01:40:59.953
INCREASES AS A PERSON THEN GETS

01:41:00.020 --> 01:41:06.193
OLDER. WE ALSO KNOW THAT SOME

01:41:06.260 --> 01:41:07.628
CALIFORNIA COLOR HAVE HIGHER

01:41:07.694 --> 01:41:09.029
RATES OF UNDERLYING HEALTH

01:41:09.096 --> 01:41:11.098
CONDITIONS AND HAVE LESS ACCESS

01:41:11.165 --> 01:41:12.266
TO HEALTH COVERAGE. FOR

01:41:12.332 --> 01:41:14.168
INSTANCE LET NEXT CALIFORNIANS

01:41:14.234 --> 01:41:16.236
ARE MORE LIKELY TO REPORT FAIR

01:41:16.303 --> 01:41:17.104
OR POOR HEALTH AND TO BE

01:41:17.171 --> 01:41:19.506
UNINSURED. ABOUT ONE IN FIVE

01:41:19.573 --> 01:41:20.841
LATIN NEXT CALIFORNIANS DID NOT

01:41:20.908 --> 01:41:23.143
HAVE A USUAL SOURCE OF CARE AND

01:41:23.210 --> 01:41:25.012
ONE IN SIX EXPERIENCE

01:41:25.078 --> 01:41:26.780
DIFFICULTY FINDING A SPECIALIST.

01:41:26.847 --> 01:41:28.715
EVEN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC LACK

01:41:28.782 --> 01:41:30.350
OF ACCESSIBLE AND QUALITY

01:41:30.417 --> 01:41:32.953
HEALTH CARE COVERAGE. ENTERED A

01:41:33.020 --> 01:41:34.254
LOT OF PEOPLE FROM RECEIVING

01:41:34.321 --> 01:41:36.123
PROPOFOL PREVENTIVE CARE

01:41:36.190 --> 01:41:38.192
TREATMENT FOR CHRONIC DISEASES

01:41:38.258 --> 01:41:40.027
AND SEEKING TREATMENT WHEN

01:41:40.093 --> 01:41:42.529
NEEDED DUE TO THE COST. WE ALSO

01:41:42.596 --> 01:41:44.531
KNOW THAT LATIN NEXT ADULTS AS

01:41:44.598 --> 01:41:45.399
WELL AS BLACK AND AMERICAN

01:41:45.466 --> 01:41:47.301
INDIAN ADULTS EXPERIENCE HIGHER

01:41:47.367 --> 01:41:48.769
RATES OF OBESITY IN CALIFORNIA

01:41:48.836 --> 01:41:50.170
AND HAVING OF CITY IS

01:41:50.237 --> 01:41:52.105
CONSIDERED TO BE A RISK FACTOR

01:41:52.172 --> 01:41:54.475
FOR SEVERE ILLNESS. FROM COVERT

01:41:54.541 --> 01:41:56.009
NINETEEN. AND IF WE COULD TAKE

01:41:56.076 --> 01:41:58.045
ONE STEP BACK AND ASK WHY DO WE

01:41:58.111 --> 01:41:59.480
SEE RACIAL HEALTH DISPARITIES

01:41:59.546 --> 01:42:01.348
IN THE FIRST PLACE. WELL WE

01:42:01.415 --> 01:42:02.549
COULD SPEND THE REST OF THE DAY

01:42:02.616 --> 01:42:04.117
UNPACKING THIS BUT IT ALL

01:42:04.184 --> 01:42:06.854
REALLY BOILS DOWN TO RACISM.

01:42:06.920 --> 01:42:08.422
DUE TO HISTORIC AND ONGOING

01:42:08.489 --> 01:42:10.257
RACIST POLICIES AND PRACTICES

01:42:10.324 --> 01:42:12.459
THAT PART CHILDREN FAMILIES AND

01:42:12.526 --> 01:42:14.328
INDIVIDUALS FROM EQUAL ACCESS

01:42:14.394 --> 01:42:16.630
TO HEALTH CARE EMPLOYMENT

01:42:16.697 --> 01:42:18.732
HOUSING EDUCATION AND OTHER

01:42:18.799 --> 01:42:20.334
OPPORTUNITIES TO THRIVE.

01:42:20.400 --> 01:42:21.568
COMMUNITIES OF COLOR HAVE

01:42:21.635 --> 01:42:22.903
UNDERLYING HEALTH CONDITIONS

01:42:22.970 --> 01:42:25.038
THAT MAKE THEM MORE VULNERABLE

01:42:25.105 --> 01:42:25.873
TO HEALTH THREATS LIKE COVERT

01:42:25.939 --> 01:42:27.741
NINETEEN. THERE IS A LOT OF

01:42:27.808 --> 01:42:29.109
RESEARCH THAT DOCUMENTS HOW

01:42:29.176 --> 01:42:30.944
RACISM PERSISTS IN VARIOUS

01:42:31.011 --> 01:42:32.813
INSTITUTIONS AND HOW THAT

01:42:32.880 --> 01:42:34.448
NEGATIVELY IMPACTS HEALTH BUT

01:42:34.515 --> 01:42:35.849
LET ME JUST HIGHLIGHT ONE

01:42:35.916 --> 01:42:37.518
CONCRETE EXAMPLE. OUR

01:42:37.584 --> 01:42:39.753
ENVIRONMENT EVERYONE DESERVES

01:42:39.820 --> 01:42:40.687
TO LIVE IN A HEALTHY

01:42:40.754 --> 01:42:42.289
ENVIRONMENT BUT THE REALITY IS

01:42:42.356 --> 01:42:43.857
THAT COMMUNITIES OF COLOR

01:42:43.924 --> 01:42:45.692
PARTICULARLY BLACK AND LATIN

01:42:45.759 --> 01:42:47.160
NEXT CALIFORNIANS ARE MORE

01:42:47.227 --> 01:42:48.629
LIKELY TO LIVE IN NEIGHBORHOODS

01:42:48.695 --> 01:42:50.831
WITH POOR AIR QUALITY. AND IN

01:42:50.898 --> 01:42:52.566
CLOSER PROXIMITY TO HAZARD IS

01:42:52.633 --> 01:42:54.334
WASTE SITES THAN WHITE

01:42:54.401 --> 01:42:57.004
CALIFORNIANS. ALSO BLACK LATIN

01:42:57.070 --> 01:42:59.373
NEXT AND ASIAN CALIFORNIANS ARE

01:42:59.439 --> 01:43:01.441
ON AVERAGE EXPOSED TO MORE

01:43:01.508 --> 01:43:02.976
POLLUTION FROM VEHICLES LIKE

01:43:03.043 --> 01:43:05.712
CARS TRUCKS AND BUSES AS THEN

01:43:05.779 --> 01:43:07.814
WHITE CALIFORNIANS. AND THIS IS

01:43:07.881 --> 01:43:10.150
NOT ACCIDENTAL ENVIRONMENTAL

01:43:10.217 --> 01:43:11.985
FACTORS ARE DEEPLY ROOTED IN

01:43:12.052 --> 01:43:14.054
RACIST POLICIES AND ACTIONS

01:43:14.121 --> 01:43:15.689
SUCH AS GOVERNMENT SUPPORTED

01:43:15.756 --> 01:43:17.357
HOUSING DISCRIMINATION

01:43:17.424 --> 01:43:19.459
REDLINING SEGREGATION UNEQUAL

01:43:19.526 --> 01:43:22.529
DISTRIBUTION OF POWER AND

01:43:22.596 --> 01:43:23.397
DISINVESTMENT FROM COMMUNITIES.

01:43:23.463 --> 01:43:25.098
HARMFUL CHEMICALS AND POLLUTION

01:43:25.165 --> 01:43:26.633
IN THE ENVIRONMENT IRRITATE THE

01:43:26.700 --> 01:43:27.834
LUNGS AND CONTRIBUTE TO

01:43:27.901 --> 01:43:29.536
RESPIRATORY AND CARDIOVASCULAR

01:43:29.603 --> 01:43:31.271
HEALTH PROBLEMS INCLUDING

01:43:31.338 --> 01:43:33.707
ASTHMA A LUNG CANCER AND HEART

01:43:33.774 --> 01:43:36.843
DISEASE. THESE TOXIC UNHEALTHY

01:43:36.910 --> 01:43:38.245
CONDITIONS ARE HARMFUL TO

01:43:38.312 --> 01:43:39.680
HEALTH AND IT ALSO INCREASES

01:43:39.746 --> 01:43:41.381
THE RISK OF SEVERE ILLNESS FROM

01:43:41.448 --> 01:43:44.084
COVERT NINETEEN. A RECENT STUDY

01:43:44.151 --> 01:43:45.852
IN FACT FOUND AN ASSOCIATION

01:43:45.919 --> 01:43:47.988
BETWEEN LONG TERM EXPOSURE TO

01:43:48.055 --> 01:43:50.123
AIR POLLUTION AND A COUNTY'S

01:43:50.190 --> 01:43:52.125
COVERT NINETEEN MORTALITY RATE.

01:43:52.192 --> 01:43:53.360
SO WHEN I TALK ABOUT THESE

01:43:53.427 --> 01:43:54.962
CONDITIONS IN WHICH WE LIVE

01:43:55.028 --> 01:43:57.698
LEARN WORK PLAY AN AGE I'M

01:43:57.764 --> 01:43:59.166
REFERRING TO THE SOCIAL

01:43:59.232 --> 01:44:00.033
DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH WHICH

ASSEMBLY MEMBER ADAM BLATT

01:44:01.702 --> 01:44:03.470
MENTIONED EARLIER. RESEARCH

01:44:03.537 --> 01:44:04.471
SHOWS THAT THE SOCIAL

01:44:04.538 --> 01:44:05.472
DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH

01:44:05.539 --> 01:44:07.574
SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT HEALTH AND

01:44:07.641 --> 01:44:09.076
ACTUALLY HAS A MUCH GREATER

01:44:09.142 --> 01:44:11.812
IMPACT ON HEALTH OUTCOMES THAN

01:44:11.878 --> 01:44:14.481
MEDICAL CARE. IN OTHER WORDS

01:44:14.548 --> 01:44:16.350
BECAUSE OF ONGOING AND HISTORIC

01:44:16.416 --> 01:44:18.352
RACISM AND DISCRIMINATION THE

01:44:18.418 --> 01:44:20.387
CONTEXT OF A COMMUNITY OR WHERE

01:44:20.454 --> 01:44:22.889
A PERSON LIVES MATTERS. FOR

01:44:22.956 --> 01:44:23.890
THEIR OVERALL HEALTH AND WELL

01:44:23.957 --> 01:44:26.560

I JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY MY

01:53:30.136 --> 01:53:31.171
COLLEAGUES AND I WITH THE

BACKING OF CNA ARE NURSES

01:53:32.939 --> 01:53:35.208
UNION. WE'RE STARTING TO ASK

01:53:35.275 --> 01:53:37.143
SOME VERY IMPORTANT QUESTIONS.

01:53:37.210 --> 01:53:38.411
HOW PREPARED ARE WE AS A

01:53:38.478 --> 01:53:40.713
HOSPITAL. WHAT SHOULD WE BE

01:53:40.780 --> 01:53:42.415
DOING TO MITIGATE THIS

01:53:42.482 --> 01:53:44.951
IMPENDING PANDEMIC. AS A

01:53:45.018 --> 01:53:46.186
HEALTHCARE COMMUNITY WE HAVE

01:53:46.252 --> 01:53:48.688
ALWAYS KNOWN THE POTENTIAL FOR

01:53:48.755 --> 01:53:49.255
ANOTHER MASSIVE PANDEMIC TO

01:53:49.322 --> 01:53:52.625
OCCUR. WE HAD JUST A BIRDIE

01:53:52.692 --> 01:53:54.694
BOLA AND FOUGHT HARD TO MAKE

01:53:54.761 --> 01:53:56.362
SURE HOSPITALS WERE PREPARED

01:53:56.429 --> 01:53:58.731
FOR THAT VIRUS. WE KNOW WAS

01:53:58.798 --> 01:53:59.966
NURSES WE CAN BE CALLED INTO

01:54:00.033 --> 01:54:01.968
BATTLE AGAINST MASS DISASTERS

01:54:02.035 --> 01:54:04.204
VIRUSES MASS CASUALTIES AND

01:54:04.270 --> 01:54:05.471
BEING IN CALIFORNIA WITH THE

01:54:05.538 --> 01:54:07.340
POTENTIAL FOR EARTHQUAKES. IT

01:54:07.407 --> 01:54:09.275
WAS JUST SOMETHING WE

01:54:09.342 --> 01:54:09.876
UNDERSTOOD IT'S JUST A MATTER

01:54:09.943 --> 01:54:12.111
OF TIME. WHAT TO SAY THAT WE

01:54:12.178 --> 01:54:13.513
ARE MENTALLY PREPARED FOR COLD

01:54:13.580 --> 01:54:15.682
IT AND HOW DEVASTATING IT WOULD

01:54:15.748 --> 01:54:18.418
BECOME. WOULD BE A LIE. WE KNEW

01:54:18.484 --> 01:54:18.952
THAT THE MOST VULNERABLE

01:54:19.018 --> 01:54:21.521
POPULATIONS WOULD BE THOSE

01:54:21.588 --> 01:54:22.388
ALREADY DISADVANTAGED IN

01:54:22.455 --> 01:54:25.225
SOCIETY. IT WOULD BE THE BLACK

01:54:25.291 --> 01:54:25.758
INDIGENOUS AND LATIN NEXT

01:54:25.825 --> 01:54:29.162
COMMUNITY. YOU ONLY HAVE TO

01:54:29.229 --> 01:54:30.129
LOOK AT HOW HISTORY AND SOCIAL

01:54:30.196 --> 01:54:32.098
DETERMINANTS. ALREADY

01:54:32.165 --> 01:54:34.400
PREDESTINED THIS AUTUMN. THERE

01:54:34.467 --> 01:54:35.902
ARE A FEW THINGS THAT ME AND MY

01:54:35.969 --> 01:54:36.903
COLLEAGUES WERE NOT PREPARED

01:54:36.970 --> 01:54:38.905
FOR. INCLUDING THE COMPLETE

01:54:38.972 --> 01:54:40.506
INCOMPETENCE OF THE FORMER

01:54:40.573 --> 01:54:43.209
WHITE HOUSE ADMINISTRATION THE

01:54:43.276 --> 01:54:44.911
WEAKENING OF THE CDC. AND THE

01:54:44.978 --> 01:54:47.080
INTERACTIVE OFFICE OF CAL OSHA

01:54:47.146 --> 01:54:48.281
AND THE UNWILLINGNESS OF

01:54:48.348 --> 01:54:50.617
HOSPITALS TO PURSUE THE

01:54:50.683 --> 01:54:53.586
PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE. TO BE

01:54:53.653 --> 01:54:56.823
SUCCINCT. THE PRECAUTIONARY

01:54:56.889 --> 01:54:58.358
PRINCIPLE IS AN APPROACH TO

01:54:58.424 --> 01:55:00.793
RISK MANAGEMENT THAT ENSURES

01:55:00.860 --> 01:55:02.128
THAT WHEN YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT

01:55:02.195 --> 01:55:03.463
YOU'RE DEALING WITH YOU GO

01:55:03.529 --> 01:55:04.964
ABOVE AND BEYOND TO PROTECT THE

01:55:05.031 --> 01:55:07.066
SAFETY OF THOSE INVOLVED DO AS

01:55:07.133 --> 01:55:08.701
MUCH AS YOU CAN NOT THE LEAST

01:55:08.768 --> 01:55:10.970
YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH. MY

01:55:11.037 --> 01:55:13.106
COLLEAGUE CNA AND I'D HAVE

01:55:13.172 --> 01:55:14.941
INSISTED THAT HOSPITALS APPLY

01:55:15.008 --> 01:55:19.545
THIS PRINCIPLE. SORRY TO THE

01:55:19.612 --> 01:55:22.248
CODEPENDENT ACT WHICH INCLUDES

01:55:22.315 --> 01:55:24.317
A DEMAND FROM ALL WORKPLACES.

01:55:24.384 --> 01:55:25.118
THE HIGHEST STANDARDS OF

01:55:25.184 --> 01:55:26.319
PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT

01:55:26.386 --> 01:55:27.620
TRAINING AND HANDS ON

01:55:27.687 --> 01:55:29.822
ADDITIONAL STAFFING TO PROTECT

01:55:29.889 --> 01:55:31.691
PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY. TO

01:55:31.758 --> 01:55:32.692
THE DETRIMENT OF MANY OF OUR

01:55:32.759 --> 01:55:34.093
COLLEAGUES INCLUDING THE MOST

01:55:34.160 --> 01:55:35.695
SMALLER POPULATIONS THAT I

01:55:35.762 --> 01:55:37.930
MENTIONED THE HOSPITAL'S FAILED

01:55:37.997 --> 01:55:38.464
TO APPLY THE PRECAUTIONARY

01:55:38.531 --> 01:55:42.502
PRINCIPLE. AS A CONSEQUENCE.

01:55:42.568 --> 01:55:43.236
ONCE THE PARK COMMUNITY WERE

01:55:43.303 --> 01:55:45.204
LEFT BEHIND BECAUSE BLACK AND

01:55:45.271 --> 01:55:46.839
BROWN WORKERS TEND TO HAVE LESS

01:55:46.906 --> 01:55:48.474
JOB PROTECTIONS YOUR JOB SUFFER

01:55:48.541 --> 01:55:49.542
FROM JOB IN HOUSING AND

01:55:49.609 --> 01:55:51.110
SECURITY HAVE LITTLE OR NO

01:55:51.177 --> 01:55:53.413
HEALTH CARE COVERAGE AND LITTLE

01:55:53.479 --> 01:55:56.149
TO NO SICK TIME. WORKING IN

01:55:56.215 --> 01:55:57.617
MINIMUM WAGE JOB TO FEED YOUR

01:55:57.684 --> 01:55:59.786
FAMILY AND YOURSELF PAY BILLS.

01:55:59.852 --> 01:56:01.120
AND RENT LEAVE LITTLE TO COVER

01:56:01.187 --> 01:56:03.256
HEALTH CARE COSTS. THIS WAS

01:56:03.323 --> 01:56:04.691
EVIDENT PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC

01:56:04.757 --> 01:56:05.958
IN WAS EXACERBATED DURING COLD

01:56:06.025 --> 01:56:09.162
IT. PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC WE IN

01:56:09.228 --> 01:56:11.164
HEALTHCARE HAVE KNOWN FOR A

01:56:11.230 --> 01:56:12.699
LONG TIME THAT THERE'S A NEED

01:56:12.765 --> 01:56:14.600
TO ADDRESS EQUITABLE CARE. AS A

01:56:14.667 --> 01:56:16.169
NURSE OF TEN YEARS WORKING WITH

01:56:16.235 --> 01:56:17.737
CHRONICALLY ILL PATIENTS I SEE

01:56:17.804 --> 01:56:19.272
THE STRAIN ON FAMILY IS AS THEY

01:56:19.339 --> 01:56:21.441
CARE FOR LOVED ONES. BATTLING

01:56:21.507 --> 01:56:22.375
CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS OR

01:56:22.442 --> 01:56:24.110
DISEASE. I HAVE SEEN THE

01:56:24.177 --> 01:56:26.846
DESPERATION OF FAMILIES THAT

01:56:26.913 --> 01:56:27.413
STRUGGLE FINANCIALLY TO CARE

01:56:27.480 --> 01:56:29.916
FOR THEIR LOVED ONES. TOO OFTEN

01:56:29.982 --> 01:56:31.517
PAY FOR MEDICATIONS TO PAY FOR

01:56:31.584 --> 01:56:32.585
TRANSPORTATION TO AND FROM

01:56:32.652 --> 01:56:35.655
APPOINTMENTS. I KNOW THAT

01:56:35.722 --> 01:56:37.190
PATIENTS WILL OFTEN WAIT UNTIL

01:56:37.256 --> 01:56:38.725
THE PAIN IS UNBEARABLE TO

01:56:38.791 --> 01:56:40.393
FINALLY COME INTO THE HOSPITAL.

01:56:40.460 --> 01:56:41.894
WE NEED TO WORK AND PAYING FOR

01:56:41.961 --> 01:56:43.529
A HSPITAL VISIT MEANS THERE IS

01:56:43.596 --> 01:56:45.298
LESS MONEY FOR FOOD OR SOME

01:56:45.365 --> 01:56:47.500
OTHER NECESSITY OR ITS TIME OFF

01:56:47.567 --> 01:56:49.268
WORK THAT THEY CAN'T AFFORD.

01:56:49.335 --> 01:56:51.003
THESE ISSUES ARE EXACERBATED

01:56:51.070 --> 01:56:52.205
DURING COLD IT AS PEOPLE ARE

01:56:52.271 --> 01:56:54.507
LAID OFF THEY HAVE LOST HOUSING

01:56:54.574 --> 01:56:57.443
AND I'VE GOTTEN SICK. CARING

01:56:57.510 --> 01:56:59.512
FOR MULTIPLE FAMILY MEMBERS IT

01:56:59.579 --> 01:57:01.280
IS THE SAME STORY THAT CYNTHIA

01:57:01.347 --> 01:57:04.117
LOPEZ SHARED EARLIER. HEALTH

01:57:04.183 --> 01:57:06.352
CARE SHOULD NOT BE DETERMINED

01:57:06.419 --> 01:57:06.953
BY SOCIAL ECONOMIC STATUS BUT

01:57:07.019 --> 01:57:08.588
IN THE U. S. IT IS. COLD IT HAS

01:57:08.654 --> 01:57:11.124
MADE THAT VERY EVIDENT. ACCESS

01:57:11.190 --> 01:57:12.859
TO TESTING COVETED EDUCATION

01:57:12.925 --> 01:57:14.827
AND EVEN HOUSING AND FOOD ARE

01:57:14.894 --> 01:57:16.596
ALL INTEGRAL TO THE MITIGATION

01:57:16.662 --> 01:57:19.332
OF THE VIRUS. WE SAW THIS LOW

01:57:19.399 --> 01:57:20.333
OR NONEXISTENT ROLLOUT OF

01:57:20.400 --> 01:57:21.968
TESTING CENTERS IN VULNERABLE

01:57:22.034 --> 01:57:24.604
AREAS. IN SAN RAFAEL I ROLLINS

01:57:24.670 --> 01:57:27.173
HERE TO SWAPPING SITE IN A

01:57:27.240 --> 01:57:28.374
PREDOMINATELY LATIN EXPERIENCE.

01:57:28.441 --> 01:57:29.409
WHAT I SAW WERE A LARGE NUMBER

01:57:29.475 --> 01:57:30.877
OF COMMUNITY MEMBERS TESTING

01:57:30.943 --> 01:57:33.279
POSITIVE. BUT WITH NO SUPPORT

01:57:33.346 --> 01:57:34.514
FINANCIALLY THEY WOULD RETURN

01:57:34.580 --> 01:57:36.749
TO WORK OR NOT ISOLATE DUE TO

01:57:36.816 --> 01:57:38.885
LACK OF SUPPORT FROM THE CITY.

01:57:38.951 --> 01:57:40.620
WHAT THE MOTHERS WERE ALSO NOW

01:57:40.686 --> 01:57:41.888
HAVING TO CONTEND WITH HOME

01:57:41.954 --> 01:57:43.055
SCHOOLING ANOTHER ADDED

01:57:43.122 --> 01:57:45.358
RESPONSIBILITY TO ALREADY FULL

01:57:45.425 --> 01:57:47.727
PLATES. HOW DOES A FAMILY

01:57:47.794 --> 01:57:49.429
ISOLATE NOT WORKING FEED

01:57:49.495 --> 01:57:50.396
THEMSELVES WITHOUT FINANCIAL

01:57:50.463 --> 01:57:53.466
SUPPORT OR FOOD DELIVERY

01:57:53.533 --> 01:57:53.933
SERVICES THIS IS NEAR

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.235
IMPOSSIBLE. THE WORLD WILL

01:57:56.302 --> 01:57:57.737
POPULATION ISN'T JUST OUTSIDE

01:57:57.804 --> 01:57:59.405

PROTECTIONS THAT ARE NEEDED FOR

01:58:08.514 --> 01:58:09.048
THE COMMUNITY ARE ALSO NEEDED

01:58:09.115 --> 01:58:12.585

OURSELVES AND OUR PATIENTS I

01:58:35.775 --> 01:58:37.743
