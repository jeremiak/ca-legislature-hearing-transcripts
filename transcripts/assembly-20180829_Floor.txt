FINALLY THE BILL WOULD NOT TAKE EFFECT UNTIL THE NEW VOTING SYSTEM MODERNIZATION PROJECT IS COMPLETED AND THE COUNTY ELECTIONS OFFICIAL.

SENATE BILL THREE TWENTY BY SENATOR LEYVA AND OTHERS AND ACTUALLY A PUBLIC HEALTH MAKING A PREPARATION THEREFORE MISS CARILLO. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS SB THREE TWENTY WOULD REQUIRE ALL CAMPUS STUDENT HEALTH CENTERS THAT PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES TO PROVIDE MEDICATION ABORTION FOR THEIR STUDENTS BY JANUARY FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY TWO ACCORDING TO THEY'RE GOOD MARKER INSTITUTE SINCE TWO THOUSAND OVER ONE POINT FIVE MILLION WOMEN IN THE UNITED STATES HAVE TERMINATED EARLY PREGNANCY THROUGH THE USE OF MEDICAL. MEDICATION ABORTION. ACCORDING TO THE U. TO A U. S. SAN FRANCISCO STUDY ABORTION MEDICATION HAS SERIOUS ADVERSE EFFECTS IN ONLY POINT 5% OF CASES. WHICH IS LESS THAN TYLENOL OR THE SAME STUDY ALSO FOUND THAT EVERY MONTH UP TO FIVE HUNDRED AND NINETEEN STUDENTS. AT THE THIRTY FOUR UC AND CSU CAMPUSES SEEK MEDICATION ABORTIONS AT OFF SITE HEALTHCARE FACILITIES. MANY CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES ALREADY OFFER REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE SERVICES SUCH AS PREGNANCY OPTION COUNSELING AND CONTRACEPTIVES. AND I'LL AND ALL CONSIDER THE SERVICES TO BE COMPONENTS OF BASIC HEALTHCARE. MEDICATION ABORTION IS A SAFE PROCEDURE AND WITH CLINICALLY SIMPLER THAN MUCH THAT MUCH OF THE CARE ALREADY OFFERED AT COLLEGE. STUDENT HEALTH CENTER SUCH AS DIABETES MANAGEMENT MENTAL HEALTH CARE AND DIAGNOSIS TREATMENT OF SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED. INFECTIONS CURRENTLY 51% OF STUDENTS ACROSS THE YOU SEE AND THE CSU SYSTEM OUR LOW INCOME IN TWO THIRDS OF THE UC STUDENTS AND ONE THIRD. OF THE CSU STUDENTS DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO RELIABLE TRANSPORTATION. IF A STUDENT HAS TO GO TO AN OFF CAMPUS PROVIDER THAT DOES NOT ACCEPT THEIR STUDENT OR OTHER PRIVATE HEALTH CARE INSURANCE PAIN FOR MEDICATION ABORTION MAY BE A SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL. BURDEN ACCESS TO MEDICATION ABORTION ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES IS CRITICAL SINCE WOMEN MUST RECEIVE THIS CARE WITHIN THE FIRST AT TEN WEEKS. OF PREGNANCY AND MOST WOMEN DON'T FIND OUT THAT THEY ARE EVEN PREGNANT UNTIL THE FIFTH OR SIXTH WEEK OF THEIR PREGNANCY. DENYING COMPREHENSIVE AND ACCESSIBLE REPRODUCTIVE CARE ON CAMPUS INTERFERES WITH THE WELL BEING ACADEMIC SUCCESS OF WOMEN AND DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT STUDENTS OF COLOR AND LOW INCOME STUDENTS. S. B. THREE TWENTY INSURES THAT COLLEGE STUDENTS HEARING CALIFORNIA HAVE ACCESS TO THE TH TO THIS CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT.

FILE ITEM NUMBER [inaudible] THREE SEVENTY FOUR THIS IS. SENATE BILL [inaudible] EIGHT SIXTY TWO KERKORIAN. SENATE BILL EIGHT SIXTY TWO BUT COMMITTEE ON BUDGET AND FISCAL REVIEW ACTUALLY THE STATE BUDGET MAKING A PREPARATION THEREFORE TO TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY BUDGET FELL. MR TANG HE MAY OPEN. THEY COMMIT SPEAKER S. B. EIGHT SIX TWO AMOUNTS TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUDGET WITH MAINLY TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS. BUT THERE A FEW KEY ITEMS CONTAINS PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE ALLOWING THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES. TO REQUEST ADDITIONAL FUNDING THROUGH THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE. RESOLVED UNACCEPTABLE WAIT TIMES AT FIELD OFFICES BUT THERE WAS NO APPROPRIATION. APPROVED AT THIS TIME THEY WOULD HAVE TO COME BACK WHILE WE'RE IN RECESS TO GET FURTHER APPROVAL OF ANY APPROPRIATION. AND ALSO ALLOCATES TWENTY THREE POINT FIVE MILLION FOR WATER RELATED PROGRAMS OF THOSE ARE BROKEN DOWN IN THIS WAY A SIX POINT EIGHT MILLION. FOR DRINKING WATERS IN SCHOOLS PROGRAM BY TEN POINT FIVE MILLION FOR EMERGENCY WELLS AND SEPTIC REPLACEMENT. THREE MILLION FOR WATER TAKE REPLACEMENT. THREE MILLION FOR WATER ASSESSMENT REPORT IT ALSO PROVIDES TEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR SERVICES FOR HUMAN TRAFFICKING. FOR WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIGHT. DANISH TANK MISTER OBERNOLTE YOU ARE RECOGNIZED MISTER SPEAKER I RISE IN OPPOSITION SB EIGHT SIXTY TWO COLLEGE MOST OF THE PROVISIONS IN THIS TRAILER BILL ARE ON CONTROVERSIAL. HOWEVER I HAVE A BIG PROBLEM WITH THE ALLOCATION TO THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES SURE ALL AWARE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT THAT DEPARTMENT HAS HAD IN RECENT MONTHS WITH THE WAIT TIMES AT FIELD OFFICES. BUT AS THE GENTLEMAN FROM SAN FRANCISCO SAID THIS BILL APPROPRIATES A POTENTIALLY UNLIMITED AMOUNT OF MONEY TO THE DMV THERE IS NO LIMIT. AND IT'S JUST CURSORY LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT ALL THE DEPARTMENT WOULD HAVE TO DO IS PETITION THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. FOR FUNDING WITH AN EXPLANATION OF WHAT THEY WANT TO USE THAT MONEY. FOR AND THAT THE DEAL EFFORT OF THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO APPROPRIATE THAT MONEY WITHOUT ANY LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT FROM US ALL WOULD REQUIRE IS A CURSORY NOTIFICATION TO THE CHAIR BUDGET THE CHAIR OF APPROPRIATIONS. AND I THINK THAT'S A VERY DANGEROUS THING TO DO ESPECIALLY SINCE WE JUST REJECTED THE IDEA OF AUDITING THE DMV AND IN THAT HEARING WHEN I QUESTIONED THE DIRECTOR. ABOUT HOW THE DEPARTMENT HAD SPENT THE SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS WE APPROPRIATED LAST YEAR FOR THE PURPOSES OF ALLEVIATING WAIT TIMES SHE WAS NOT ONLY UNABLE TO ARTICULATE WHERE THAT MONEY HAD GONE. BUT SHE ADMITTED THAT THEY DID NOT OPEN THE FIELD OFFICES ON SATURDAYS AS THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO DO IN JANUARY INSTEAD THEY WERE NOT A FULLY OPEN UNTIL AUGUST. SO WELL IN THAT KIND OF ENVIRONMENT I THINK IT'S A VERY DANGEROUS THING TO DO TO WRITE THEM WHAT IT WHAT AMOUNTS TO A BLANK CHECK. I URGE A NO VOTE. MR ACOSTA. BE A RECKONING THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER OB. WE'VE HEARD SOME DISCUSSION OF ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR A BUDGET THAT TRAILER BILL AND CERTAIN ITEMS THERE IN IT I I I I I DO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL BUT I HAVE SOME CONCERNS AND I THINK WE NEED. TO THE VERY NEAR FUTURE THERE ARE ARE ITEMS IN THIS BILL OF THAT ARE VERY IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY RELATED HUMAN TRAFFICKING AYE TESTING OF THE SEXUAL ASSAULT THE EVIDENCE KITS. BUT THOSE LOOK THE ONE PIECE THAT WAS JUST MENTIONED BY MY COLLEAGUE AND HOW FROM BIG BEAR THAT IS PARTICULAR TO OP PROBLEMATIC IS THE THE DMB FINDING. OUT WHAT WE HAVE A VERY ROBUST DISCUSSION NOT ONLY IN A IN A BUDGET COMMITTEE BUT ALSO AND THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES I ASKED A VERY SIMILAR QUESTION ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM THE FUNDING THAT WE ALLOCATED. FOR SATURDAY SERVICE ALL THE ANSWER WAS NOT ONLY UNSATISFACTORY BUT ONCE WE DID GET AN ANSWER FROM THE DIRECTOR OF THE DMV. OF THE ISSUE WAS -- AND THE ANSWER WAS THAT THE MONEY HAD BEEN SPENT ON OVERTIME AND WE DIDN'T HAVE SATURDAY SERVICE WE HAVE SET UP TO SEVEN OUR LINES IN OUR D. M. V.. AND THAT IS JUST SIMPLY UNACCEPTABLE WHEN PEOPLE ARE PASSING OUT IN THE SUMMER HEAT IN LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT -- DID THIS THIS INCREASE SPENDING MADE LITTLE TO NO DENT IN THE DMB SAW AND ADD THEM TO THE DELAYS AT THE LINES OF THE NB IN MY DISTRICT AND OTHERS. I'M DISTURBED THE BILL BASICALLY AMOUNTS TO A BLANK CHECK TO THE MP AS WAS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED IF MORE MONEY IS NEEDED. ARE FOR TO ENSURE PROMPT SERVICE THAT WE HAVE TO AGREE AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE MOMENT. TO INTO -- ISSUE AN AUDIT TO OF THE DMB THAT WE MAKE SURE IT'S BEING SPENT WISELY THAT IS OUR NUMBER ONE PRIORITY. I'VE AND AS I SEE IT WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE PEOPLE'S MONEY IN THE BUDGET I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY BUT I ENCOURAGE THIS LEGISLATURE. THAT WE MUST COME BACK AND WE MUST GET ANSWERS TO THESE VEXING QUESTIONS ABOUT WORK TAXPAYER MONEY IS GOING THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER SPEAKER. AMOS COSTED DOCTOR CHOI. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU SPEAKER AND THE MEMBERS SAW I RISE. TODAY IN STRONG OPPOSITION TO THIS MATTER BECAUSE OF OUR FUNDING. A MEASURE OF TWO THE AND THE HERE WE GO AGAIN. I YET ANOTHER. ARE JUST LEGISLATURE DECIDES. TO ATTACK THE YEAH. EASY WAY OUT. WHEN IT COMES TO OUR AYE ISSUES? PLAGUING OUR OF CONSTITUENTS. IS A VERY CLEAR THAT THE THERE IS SOME ON OUR EFFICIENCY PROBLEM. NOT AT THE DMV THAT IS. THE RELEASE ON A YACHT JOINT COMMITTEE MET. EARLIER THIS MONTH. DURING THAT THE HEARING HEARING. BE AYE DIRECTOR OF WHAT THE M. V. STRUGGLED OUT TO PROVIDE A SUFFICIENT DATA ON THE CALL SOLVE TO YEAH WAIT TIMES OR ANY SORT OF A PLAN TO FIX THEM. HOW DOES THE JOB? THIS BODY REACTOR. TOWARD THIS ARE. DEBORAH NIXON OF MATURITY. NOT BY YOUNG HOLDING. THIS OUR INDIVIDUAL OUR SAW. ACCOUNTABLE LAW TO THE CONSTITUENTS SAYS SAW. NOT THAT WE OR SERVE. BY THROWING OUT MORE OF DO TAXPAYERS -- HALT OR IN THE MONEY. ARE AT THE PROBLEM. ALL WHY I LOCKED TELLING OUT REQUEST OF FOUR LEGISLATIVE WELL ORG OFTEN GOT D. M. V.. THAT OUGHT WOULD HAVE HELPED US A TOUR OUT REALLY UNDERSTAND VIA PROBLEM AND THE PROVIDE OUR ON EFFECTIVE A SOLUTION. ONCE AGAIN THE LEGISLATURE FAILURE SO TO DO THE HARD WORK. REQUIRED TO TO MAKE SURE THAT THE TAXPAYER SAW ON GETTING A GOOD RETURN ON THE LARGER AMOUNT OF THE MONEY THAT THEY ARE ALREADY PAY. OFF WITH THIS SERVICE. IT'S NOT ABOUT JUSTALL GO BACK TO WHAT THAT THE BELIEVE ARE. TOBY YA BOTTOMLESS PIT. THE TAXPAYERS SAW WHAT IT. I WORK CONSTITUENTS A DESERVE OUR AID [inaudible] BETTER ANSWER. AND DUG ITSELF STUFF BETTER THAN THIS. I STRONGLY URGE YOU AN AWFUL LOT. MS BAKER YOUR RECOGNIZE. THINK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS -- THIS WAS THE YEAR THAT WE SAW A LOT OF COLLEAGUES EARLIER THIS YEAR EXPRESS. DEEP OUTRAGE AND HOW THEY FELT THEY WERE FORCED TO VOTE. I HEARD FROM MANY COLLEAGUES THAT CLEARLY DIDN'T WANT TO VOTE FOR SOME OF THE MEASURES THEY HAD EARLIER THIS YEAR THEY WERE JUST OUTRAGED. I I THINK THERE WAS LIKE OUR SPEECHES ON AND I AM SPEAKING TO MY COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE AND I'M WONDERING WHERE IS THAT. WITH THIS BILL I'M GONNA VOTE FOR IT BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN GETTING THE RAPE KIT ISSUE DEALT WITH IN THE STATE. AND I BELIEVE WE NEED TO FIGHT HUMAN TRAFFICKING. AND I BELIEVE WE NEED TO FIX THE DMV AND I CANNOT THINK OF A WORSE WAY TO TACKLE THE CHALLENGES AT THE DMV THAN WHAT IS IN THIS BUDGET TRAILER. IT NOT ONLY. COMPLETELY IGNORES THE AUDIT REQUEST THAT WE HAD SO THAT WE CAN HAVE AN INDEPENDENT NONPARTISAN. REVIEW OF THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES TO FIX THE PROBLEM EVERY ONE OF OUR CONSTITUENTS HAS BEEN SCREENING TO US ABOUT. I GOT LETTERS ON MY DESK HERE FROM ELDERLY CONSTITUENTS OF MINE WHO WAITED IN LINE FOR EIGHT HOURS AND PASSED OUT. INJURED THEMSELVES AND WHEN THE EMERGENCY FOLKS CAME THE DMV STAFF SAID TO THEM -- IF YOU GET OUT OF LINE YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO START ALL OVER AGAIN. SO SHE WAS TREATED FOR HER WOUNDS BY THE EMT IN LINE WITH EVERYBODY WATCHING. THIS WAS DISCUSSED IN THE HEARINGS THAT CAME FORWARD EARLIER THIS YEAR THAT THAT WE HAD. WE ALSO HAVE THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES DIRECTOR SAY THANK YOU FOR GIVING US EXTRA MONEY. WE SPENT ON SOMETHING OTHER THEN WHAT WE ASK FOR AND OTHER THAN WHAT YOU TOLD US TO DO. WE SPECIFICALLY TOLD THEM. TO SPEND IT ON ADDITIONAL HOURS TO GET AHEAD OF THIS PROBLEM AND SERVE OUR CONSTITUENTS WELL. AND INSTEAD THEY OPEN UP SATURDAY HOURS JUST A LITTLE BIT THEY'RE LIKE YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK WE HAVE A BETTER USE FOR THIS BECAUSE WE KNOW BEST OF THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES. AND SO THEY COMPLETELY CLOSE THE EXTRA HOURS AND SPEND IT ON OVERTIME. AND THIS IS THE SAME YEAR IN WHICH THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES HAD SUCH CRUMMY SERVICE FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS BUT THEY DID PROTECT THE EMPLOYEE WHO SLEPT FOR FOUR YEARS ON THE JOB. AND THEY COULD NOT POSSIBLY COME UP WITH A WAY TO FIX THAT PROBLEM. SO THE SOLUTION WE HAVE IS NOT TO WORK TOGETHER. IT'S NOT TO HAVE THE AUDIT COME FORWARD. IT'S NOT TO GET RID OF THAT OPS WITH ITS NOT TO FIX THIS PROBLEM AT THE DMV IT'S THIS IT'S TO THROW MONEY AT IT. UNLIMITED AMOUNT OF MONEY LET'S JUST THROW MONEY AT IT. LET'S NOT EVEN TRY TO FIX IT. THERE'S ZERO ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THIS MONEY THEY DON'T HAVE TO COME BACK TO US TO KEEP SPENDING THE MONEY THEY HAVE TO GO TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AND THEY HAVE NO STRINGS ATTACHED. THERE'S NO WORSE WAY TO DEAL WITH THE DMV THAN TO DO THIS SO WHERE PARTICULARLY MY COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE WE ALL WORK VERY WELL TOGETHER BUT WHERE IS YOUR OUTRAGE TODAY. WHEN YOU HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO WITH A SODA TAX WE HAVE THE PRIVACY BILL ALL THE OUTREACH WE'VE HEARD ON THIS FLOOR THIS YEAR NOT A SINGLE MIKE UP TO EXPRESS OUTRAGE? THAT THIS IS BEING PUT IN THE SAME BILL. AS RAPE KITS AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING FUNDING. SO I AM VOTING YES BUT I AM EXPECTING ALL OF US TO FIX THIS BETTER. THEY'RE ACTUALLY AMENDMENTS OFFERED TO THIS BY GOOD COLLEAGUE FROM. MENIFEE [inaudible] LAKE ELSINORE. THOSE WERE THOSE WERE SHOVED UNDER THE TABLE. WHERE'S YOUR OUTRAGE ABOUT THAT. HE WOULD EVEN LET THOSE AMENDMENTS COME UP SO THAT THIS COULD BE A BETTER BILL. SO GO BACK TO YOUR DISTRICTS AND EXPLAIN I WAS AWFULLY OUTRAGED ABOUT A BILL THATI WAS FORCED TO VOTE FOR BECAUSE I MIGHT LOSE MY CHAIRMANSHIP TO COMMITTEE. I MIGHT LOSE THIS BENEFIT OF THIS GREAT OFFICE BUT WHEN IT COMES TO FIXING THE DMV I WILL DO NOTHING BUT THROW MONEY AT IT WITH NO ACCOUNTABILITY. VOTE THE WAY YOU WANT TO VOTE BUT FIX THE DMV AND DO IT RIGHT. ALL DISCUSSION AND DEBATE HAVING CEASED. RETAIN YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE THAT ARE. COMMENTS MY COLLEAGUE FROM DUBLIN. I ABSOLUTELY SURE HER AVERAGE. IN FACT I SPENT TWO OH TWO HOURS LAST WEEK A DMB HEADQUARTERS. TO AT THE COMMAND CENTER. I ALSO HAVE VISITED. MY IDEA OF THE CENTERS IN DALY CITY. AND THE SAN FRANCISCO JUST WEEKS BEFORE THAT RIGHT AFTER OUR BUDGET HERE. THE DB IS NOT GOING TO GET FIXED. BY WAVING A MAGIC WAND THE DMV IS GONNA GET FIXED BY AGREED. ALL OF US WORKING TOGETHER THE MAKING SURE THAT THE MANAGEMENT IS HELD ACCOUNTABLE. SO THIS PARTICULAR BILL IS VERY INTERESTING BECAUSE THERE IS NO. THERE IS NO APPROPRIATIONS THE DMV CAME FORWARD TO THE BUDGET COMMITTEE. TWENTY THREE MILLION DOLLAR PROPRIOCEPTIVE WHICH WE REJECTED. WE SAID THE AND WE HAVEN'T GOT THE ANSWERS THAT ARE ACCEPTABLE. WE DON'T AGREE WITH WHAT YOU'RE ASKING FOR SO WE REJECTED THE FUNDING. WE REJECTED THE FUNDING AND SAID. WHEN YOU GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER? WHEN YOU FIGURED OUT WHAT YOU WANT TO DO WITH THIS MONEY WHEN YOU WANNA FIGURE OUT HOW YOU GOING TO FIX THE PROBLEM WE'RE HERE TO WORK WITH YOU? THEN AGAIN MY OFFICE IS OPEN AYE AYE WELCOME AND I KNOW A NUMBER OF MY COLLEAGUES ON THE BUDGET COMMITTEE. SHARE INTERESTED IN JOINING ME IN THAT EFFORT TO WORK WITH THIS DEPARTMENT TO FIX STOP PROBLEM. IN THAT IT'S NOT THAT IT IS NOT GOOD JUST HAPPEN OVERNIGHT IN THE LAST. IN THE NEXT WEEK OR TWO IT'S GOING TO TAKE AWHILE THIS PROB TOOK AWHILE TO GET TO US SKEPTIC ABOUT A FIX. IT'S GONNA REQUIRE ALL OF US TO ROLL UP OUR SLEEVES. AND GET TO WORK [inaudible] NOW. WHAT THEY CAN DO AND WHAT WE DID LEAVE OPEN IN THIS? IN THIS BUDGET BILL IS WHILE WE'RE IN RECESS BECAUSE WE CANNOT APPROVE A BUDGET BILL WALL WE ARE OUT UNLESS WE WANT TO CALL COME BACK. MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WON'T COME BACK IN THERE IN THE RECESSED TO APPROVE A BUDGET BILL THERE'S ONE ME MR FONG SO. INSTEAD WE'RE ALLOWING THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO COME BACK TO THE LEGISLATIVE BODY THAT CAN ACT ON IT WHICH IS THE JOINT. LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE WHICH KEN APPROVED [inaudible] AN APPROPRIATION [inaudible] TO IT'S THIS PROBLEM BUT ONLY IF THEY SATISFY. OR QUESTIONS [inaudible] NOW [inaudible] AGAIN. WHEN THEY CAME FORWARD AND WOULD WE HAVE THE BUDGET COMMITTEE? YOU'RE RIGHT MY QUESTIONS WERE ANSWERED SATISFACTORY I DON'T THINK UP MOST OF OUR QUESTIONS WERE ANSWERED SOUNDS MUCH I THINK WE HAD. A FAIRLY UNANIMOUS OPINION ABOUT THE UNTIL WE GET THOSE QUESTIONS ANSWERED TO OUR SATISFACTION. THERE IS NOT GOING TO BE FURTHER APPROPRIATIONS. NOW HAVING SAID THAT WE STILL HAVE AT THIS POINT. OURS LONG ONES EVERYTHING ONE OF OUR MOST OF OUR GNP IS NOT EVERY SINGLE. ONE THAT NEED TO GO FIX WERE BROUGHT TO READY GO HOME AND WE GOT DEBTS FOR THE AND YOU CAN DAMN WELL BE SURE. THAT YOU KNOW I'LL BE MEETING WITH CONSTITUENTS ALL BE PROBABLY OUT HOW MY DMV NEXT WEEK. THIRD TAKE A LOOK AT THIS PROPHECY WILL KIND OF PROGRESS THEY'VE MADE BECAUSE YOU'RE RIGHT WITH THE DIRECTOR TESTIFIED.

THIS BILL WOULD RETROACTIVELY CHANGE THE VOTER SIGNATURE REQUIREMENTS TO QUALIFY A VOTER INITIATIVE FOR THE BALLOT IN THE COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO. IT IS A BLATANTLY PARTISAN ACTION WHICH MAKES IT WORSE IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME WORK IN THE RECITALS OF THIS BILL RIGHT AT THE TOP THE COURT CASE THAT THEY'RE ATTEMPTING TO INFLUENCE. THE PLAINTIFF IN THAT CASE IS TONY COULD WORK IS THE CHAIRMAN OF THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY REPUBLICAN PARTY. THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT OUR CONSTITUENTS FEAR THE MOST. WHEN THE PEOPLE IN POWER WANT TO USE THEIR POWER TO CHANGE? THE RULES GOVERNING ELECTIONS TO KEEP THEMSELVES IN POWER.

WHAT THIS LEGISLATURE DID AND WHAT THIS BILL MAY DO IS ALLOW THE PEOPLE OF SAN DIEGO A STRAIGHT UP OR DOWN VOTE ON THE FUTURE OF THEIR ELECTIONS? NOW MEMBERS THIS IS PRETTY SIMPLE IF YOU BELIEVE IN DEMOCRACY YOU WANT THE MOST NUMBER OF PEOPLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THEIR ELECTIONS AS IT'S BEEN DONE IN THE COUNTY SAN DIEGO FOR FAR TOO LONG. A VERY SMALL MINORITY OF FOLKS GET TO SELECT THE VERY FEW PEOPLE WHO'VE ON ONE OF THE LARGEST GOVERNMENTS IN THIS STATE. WE HAVE ACTED. THE COUNTY CONTINUES TO RESIST THIS WILL SET THIS AND TO BAD. AND ALLOW THE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO ASKED FOR A VOTE TO GET A VOTE ON THAT.

SENATE BILL EIGHT SIXTY ONE BY THE COMMITTEE ON BUDGET AND FISCAL REVIEW AND ACT LIKE THE NATIONAL MORTGAGE SETTLEMENT MAKING A PREPARATION THEIR PORTS TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY ABILITY TO THE BUDGET [inaudible] MR TANK. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER S. B. EIGHT SIX ONE ADDRESS AS PART OF THE RECENT MORTGAGE SETTLEMENT COURT DECISION. AND DOES THE FOLLOWING. CLARIFY THAT THE ALLOCATION OF FUNDS IN THE TWENTY ELEVEN AND IN TWENTY ELEVEN THROUGH. TWENTY THIRTEEN WERE CONSISTENT WITH THE DIRECTION GIVEN BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. IT ALSO STATES THAT THE LEGISLATURE ABOUT PROM WAS AWARE OF THIS ALLOCATION OF FUNDS DURING THE BUDGET PROCESS. IN THE BILL ADDRESS A CERTAIN FINDINGS IN THE RECENT COURT DECISION THAT QUESTION THE BUDGET PROCESS AND IS INTENDED TO CLARIFY THAT PEACE PROCESS ISSUES [inaudible] A COURT. THE DECISION IS APPEALED. WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIGHT [inaudible] MISTER OBERNOLTE. MISTER SPEAKER I RISE IN STRONG OPPOSITION TO SB. EIGHT SIXTY ONE IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THE LARGEST SETTLEMENT IN A FINANCIAL CONSUMER PROTECTION CASE IN US HISTORY OCCURRED WAS OVER FORTY FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS. IT WAS RELATED TO THE MORTGAGE ROBO SIGNING SCANDAL WHICH I'M SURE EVERYONE REMEMBERS -- AS PART OF THAT SETTLEMENT EACH STATE WAS GIVEN A PIECE OF THE SETTLEMENT TO DISTRIBUTE AND I'D LIKE TO READ YOU FROM THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH THE DEFENDANT'S MISTER SPEAKER WITH YOUR PERMISSION. WITHOUT OBJECTION. THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT SAYS THAT FUNDS. THE SETTLEMENT IS -- TO FIND OF THE FOR THE PURPOSES INTENDED TO AVOID PREVENTABLE FORECLOSURES TO IMMIGRATE THE EFFECTS OF THE FORECLOSURE CRISIS. TO ENHANCE LAW ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS TO PREVENT AND PROSECUTE FINANCIAL FRAUD WERE UNFAIR DECEPTIVE ACTS INTO COMPENSATE THE STATES FOR THE COSTS RESULTING FROM THE ALLEGED UNLAWFUL CONTACT OF THE DEFENDANTS. SO THAT IS WHAT THE STATE WAS GIVEN THE MONEY. TO DO WITH I INSTEAD THE STATE PUT ALL OF THAT MONEY IN ITS GENERAL FUND. TO SHORE UP THE DEFICIT THAT OCCURRED IN THAT YEAR. AND INEVITABLY A LAWSUIT RESULTED AND JUST LAST MONTH A CALIFORNIA APPELLATE COURT RULED THAT THE STATE HAD ERRED IN ALLOCATING THAT MONEY -- THEY RULED THAT OF THE FOURTEEN TEN BILLION DOLLARS THAT THE STATE HAVE BEEN GIVEN THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE MILLION OF THAT MONEY SHOULD HAVE GONE TO THE VICTIMS. OF THIS FORECLOSURE CRISIS. SO THE STATE IS ATTEMPTING TO REROUTE RIGHT THE RULES HERE AND I THINK IT'S DEPLORABLE THAT IN VOTING FOR THIS WE WOULD BE TAKING THE MONEY OUT OF THE HANDS OF THE PEOPLE FOR WHOM IT WAS INTENDED. THE VICTIMS. ARE OF THIS FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY. NOT ONE TO READ FOR YOU FROM THIS BILL THE BILL THAT WERE VOTED ON TODAY THE BILL SAYS. THE LEGISLATURE FURTHER CONFIRMS AND RATIFIES THAT BECAUSE THOSE ALLOCATIONS WERE DISPLAYED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FOR TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THIRTEEN AND LEFT UNCHANGED. THE LEGISLATURE WAS AWARE OF AND APPROVED THE ALLOCATION AND EXPENDITURE OF FUNDS. THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE VOTING ON SO IF YOU VOTE YES YOUR APPROVING. THE ALLOCATION OF THOSE FUNDS A FACTOR SAYING THAT WE WERE AWARE OF THAT AND I DON'T SEE HOW ANYONE COULD SAY THAT THEY ARE AWARE OF IT IF YOU WERE ACTUALLY HERE IN. TWO THOUSAND TWELVE WHICH I WAS NOT. SO COLLEAGUES ARMORED URGE YOU TO REJECT THIS WHAT'S SPEND THAT MONEY WE GOT THE MONEY IN THE GENERAL FUND WE ARE NINE BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET SURPLUS THIS YEAR. WHAT'S PUT THAT THREE HUNDRED THIRTEEN MILLION DOLLARS WHERE THE COURT SAYING IT OUGHT TO BE IN THE HANDS OF THE PEOPLE THAT WERE AFFECTED BY THIS CRISIS. AND NOT SHORING UP THE STATE'S DEFICIT AYE ORIGINAL VOTE. FAMOUS OBERNOLTE MR ACOSTA. I THINK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I ALSO RISE IN OPPOSITION TO S. B. EIGHT SIXTY ONE AND WITH PERMISSION I'D LIKE TO SHARE A BRIEF STORY ABOUT TO ONE OF MY CONSTITUENTS AND THEIR THEIR SITUATION -- WITH MY COLLEAGUES HERE THIS THE STORY OF THAT. THIS IS A STORY OUT ABOUT -- MAN LOSING HIS HOUSE AND TWENTY TEND TO AN ABUSIVE FORECLOSURE ORLANDO R. GONI. IS A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER IN MY DISTRICT SELLING MEDICAL EQUIPMENT. WHEN IS BUSINESS STOP RECEIVING MEDICARE MONEY FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HE HAD TO PULL UP PUT ALL? PUT ALL THIS MONEY INTO HIS BUSINESS AND STRUGGLE TO MAKE MORTGAGE PAYMENTS. IS HE TRIED TO WORK WITH THIS BANK SEEKING REFINANCING A LOOKING FOR OF THE SOLUTIONS BUT THE BANK REFUSED TO HELP A MENACE FAMILY. IN TWENTY TEN THE BANK FORECLOSED ON HIS FAMILY'S HOUSE AND HE WAS FORCED TO MOVE HIS THREE CHILDREN. OUT WHILE STILL TRYING TO KEEP HIS BUSINESS AFLOAT HE NEVER QUITE RECOVERED AND NOW FORTUNATELY HIS -- HIS SON IS ABLE TO HELP WITH THIS BUSINESS NOW BUT HE STILL HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO PURCHASE ANOTHER HOME. AND THIS IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF MANY COMING OUT OF MY DISTRICT NOT TO MENTION THE OTHER SEVENTY NINE ASSEMBLY DISTRICTS REPRESENTED HERE. ACCORDING TO A REPORT BY THE CENTER FOR RESPONSIBLE LENDING IN TWENTY IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED FAMILIES PER DAY ON AVERAGE LOST THEIR HOMES BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT AND TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN MORE THAN A QUARTER MILLION CALIFORNIA FAMILIES OUT WERE SERVED WITH A NOTICES OF DEFAULT. AND IN TWENTY ELEVEN CBS REPORTED THAT FIVE OF THE TEN WORST CITIES FOR FORECLOSURE IN TWENTY TEN WERE IN CALIFORNIA. DENYING HELP TO VICTIMS OF ABUSE OF FORECLOSURE FORECLOSURES IS UNJUST AND UNFAIR AND COLLEAGUES IT'S UNCONSCIONABLE THAT WE WOULD CONTINUE TO IGNORE WHAT THE COURTS ARE TELLING US TO DO AND REFUSE TO GIVE THE MONEY BACK TO OUR CONSTITUENTS. WHO ARE IN NEED OF HELP YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD ABOUT THAT THE BUDGET SURPLUS WE'VE ALL BEEN BRAGGING ABOUT HOW GREAT THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY IS DOING AND YET?

TO ISSUE AN AUDIT REQUEST OF ALL THOSE DOCUMENTS WE FOUND OUT THAT THERE WAS. ARE ACTUALLY FRAUDULENT BEHAVIOR OUR BEHAVIOR THAT WAS ARE DISCOVERED BY MUCH OF WHAT WAS UNCOVERED IN THIS PARTICULAR COURT CASE. I AND WALDRON THE ACTIONS OF THOSE LENDERS WERE ACTUALLY AN EXCUSABLE THE DEPREDATIONS OF DEVASTATION THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WAS A HAS BEEN AND CONTINUES TO BE FELT FOR YEARS A THAT IS NOT WITH THIS PARTICULAR BUDET THIS BUDGET BILL IS REALLY DEALING WITH STATE CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY. OF THE LEGISLATURE IN THE LEGISLATURE'S ABILITY TO APPROPRIATE. AND WHILE WE WORK HERE AT THAT PARTICULAR TIME THE YEARS OF THROUGH -- TWENTY FOURTEEN THOSE -- BUDGET YEARS. AT TIMES WERE [inaudible] CHALLENGING. AND THAT NOW THOSE LEGISLATORS IF YOU TALK TO THEM HOW TO MAKE A VERY -- CHALLENGING DECISIONS THE DECISIONS THAT THEY ARE FRANKLY WOULD NOT WISH ON ANY OF US. WOULD NOT WISH TO RELIVE -- BUT THEY AREN'T DECISION IS REALLY THE ULTIMATE AUTHORITY OF THIS LEGISLATURE TO APPROPRIATE. THE FUNDING FOR OUR GENERAL FUND AND FOR THIS BUDGET. AUNT DOT IS WHAT THIS BUDGET BILL CLARIFIES THIS BUDGET TO CLARIFY THAT THE LEGISLATURE'S AUTHORITY. IS ENSHRINED IN THE CONSTITUTION THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ALL TAKE AN OATH EVERY TWO YEARS TO DEFEND. AND IT IS JUST CLARIFYING THAT PARTICULAR ACTION THAT THAT LEGISLATURE DURING THOSE APPROPRIATE YEARS.

MISTER OBERNOLTE MISTER SPEAKER I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB EIGHT SIXTY SEVEN ALTHOUGH I THINK IT'S UNFORTUNATE.

THANK YOU MISTER OBERNOLTE AND MISTER COOLEY. YES IS A VERY IMPORTANT BUDGET BUDGET MEASURE TAKING A BY CAMEL APPROACH TO THESE ISSUES. IT IS GROUNDBREAKING BOTH FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE LEGISLATURE.

A PARTICULARLY SPEAKER RENDON AND PRO TEM ATKINS FOR THEIR AMAZING SUPPORT AS WE WORKED TOGETHER IN A BICAMERAL MATTER. TO CRAFT REALLY GROUND FOR SETTING POLICIES TO PREVENT SEXUAL HARASSMENT FROM HAPPENING IN THIS BUILDING. AND WHAT WE'VE DONE IN TERMS OF SETTING UP AN INDEPENDENT UNIT WHICH OF COURSE THIS BILL WILL NOW FINANCE. IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT'S BEEN DONE IN STATE HOUSES ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND FOR LEADERSHIP TO HAVE. TAKEN THE STEP. TO GIVE UP THEIR OWN POWER. TO ALLOW THIRD PARTY TO COME IN AND A COMMITTEE TO COME IN. TO ADJUDICATE AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS IN TERMS OF RESPONSE AWAY FROM THE SENSE OF BIAS AND POLITICAL INFLUENCE THAT OFTEN PERMEATES THESE KINDS OF DECISIONS. IS REALLY REMARKABLE. AND I ALSO WANT TO SAY THAT THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE PROCESS OF MANY HEARINGS AND MANY MANY MONTHS. WE RECEIVED NOTHING BUT SUPPORT FROM THE MEMBERS OF THIS LEGISLATURE. I TAKE THIS WHERE THE COMMITTEE. ON THE SENATE SIDE AND THE ASSEMBLY SIDE FELT THAT IT SHOULD GO. SO I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE THAT WAS INVOLVED I'M VERY PROUD TO BE ABLE TO CAST A AYE VOTE FOR THIS MEASURE TODAY.

MISTER CHAIR. I THINK IT SPEAKER S. B. EIGHT SEVEN THREE PROVIDES OF LEGISLATIVE RATIFICATION FOR TWO BARGAINING UNITS BARGAINING UNIT NINE WHICH IS THE ENGINEERS UNIT. IN BARGAINING UNIT TEN WHICH IS THE SCIENTIST UNIT. INCLUDES A SOUTH SALARY INCREASE FOR THE ENGINEERS UNIT OF FOUR POINT 5% EFFECTIVE JULY FIRST TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND ANOTHER 4% INCREASE. EFFECTIVE JULY WIND. TWENTY NINETEEN FOR THE SCIENTIST PARKING UNIT AND WHAT YOU INCLUDES A 5% INCREASE. OFFER BOTH TWENTY NINETEEN AND TWENTY TWENTY THE SALARY INCREASES ARE COMMENSURATE WITH WHAT IS -- BELIEVED TO BE -- SALARY INCREASES IN STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE UNITS ARE REMAIN COMPETITIVE. THAT ALSO MAKES CONTRACT VALID FOR ONLY A TWO YEAR PERIOD WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH THE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN ELLIOTT RECOMMENDATION. WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FEDERAL. SURE OBERNOLTE MISTER SPEAKER I AM CERTAINLY PROPONENT OF FAIRLY COMPENSATING OUR STATE EMPLOYEES AND I ACTUALLY USUALLY VOTE IN SUPPORT. OF THESE MEMORANDUMS OF UNDERSTANDING WITH OUR BARGAINING UNITS BUT I HAVE TO RISE IN OPPOSITION OF THESE PARTICULAR MEMO USE. I'M CONCERNED WITH THE OVERALL LEVEL OF COMPENSATION INCREASE AS THE CHAIR SAID THESE INCREASED COMPENSATION BETWEEN FOUR AND 5% FOR THESE BARGAINING UNITS IT'S CLOSER 25% THE AVERAGE. AND THIS IS IN AN ERA WHEN INFLATION IN THE STATE ACCORDING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAS BEEN RUNNING LESS THAN 3%. AND IN ADDITION TO THOSE ARE COMPENSATION INCREASES THEIR INCREASES TO THINGS LOCKED. BONUSES BONUSES FOR EDUCATION IN UNIFORM ALLOWANCES TAKEN TOGETHER SO IT'S GONNA BE A VERY COSTLY PACKAGE FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND I'M CONCERNED THAT IF WE GRANT THESE LEVEL OF COMPENSATION INCREASES TO ALL OF OUR BARGAINING UNITS. IT'S JUST NOT SUSTAINABLE IN THE LONG TERM I ALSO HAVE A CONCERN ABOUT SPECIFICALLY THE MO YOU FOR BARGAINING UNIT. NINE THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST YESTERDAY ISSUED A REPORT AN ANALYSIS OF THIS AMMO YOU AND IN THAT REPORT THEY POINTED OUT THAT THIS AMMO YOU WILL CAUSE SUBSTANTIAL PROBLEMS FOR CALTRANS IF PROPOSITIONS SIX IS PASSED BY THE VOTERS IN NOVEMBER.

MINOR DISCREET WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM BIG BEAR -- I DO BELIEVE THAT THIS DOES.

PRIOR TO THE RULING. THIS BILL IS A BLATANT ATTEMPT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO MEDDLE IN PRE JUDGING THAT CASE. IT'S COMPLETELY INAPPROPRIATE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO BE PREJUDGING AND PUTTING PRESSURE ON THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM WE SHOULD LET THE COURT SYSTEM WORK. I ALSO HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THIS. A LANGUAGE BEING INCLUDED IN A BUDGET TRAILER BILL. BECAUSE IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE BUDGET AND I SUBMIT THE ONLY REASON WHY WE'RE VOTING ON IT AS A BUDGET TRAILER BILL.

ELEVEN FIFTY SIX IS JUST ABOUT ONE THING. PREVENTING FINANCIALLY INTERESTED TREATMENT CENTERS FROM FINDING WAYS TO UNDERWRITE COMMERCIAL INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR THEIR PATIENTS. IN ORDER TO PAD THEIR PROFITS. THEY'VE BEEN DOING SO BY STEERING PATIENTS TO APPLY FOR COMMERCIAL INSURANCE PLANS INSTEAD OF A PATIENT'S MEDICARE OR MEDICAID COVERAGE WITH ONE GOAL. TO MAXIMIZE THEIR PROFITS. PREMIUMS FOR VULNERABLE PATIENTS ARE BEING PAID FOR EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY BY THESE TREATMENT CENTERS AND IT IS NO COINCIDENCE THAT THESE POLICIES HAVE HIGHER REIMBURSEMENT RATES FOR TREATMENT. THE WHAT THE PATIENT'S ALTERNATE COVERAGE WOULD PAY. SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT FACILITIES DIALYSIS CLINICS AND OTHERS CAN BOOST THEIR PROFITS BY MORE THAN A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS PER PATIENT ANNUALLY. BY STEERING PATIENTS INTO COMMERCIAL COVERAGE THAT MAY NOT FIT THE PATIENT'S NEEDS. THIS RESULTS IN HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN UNNECESSARY AND INCREASED HEALTH CARE RELATED SPENDING THE GETS SPREAD ACROSS EVERY ONE OF US. IN THE FORM OF INCREASED PREMIUMS. TO PREVENT THIS ABUSE S. B. ELEVEN FIFTY SIX WOULD REQUIRE FINANCIALLY INTERESTED ENTITIES WHENEVER THEY PAY FOR THE HEALTH INSURANCE ON BEHALF OF A PATIENT. TWO ONE INFORM THE PATIENT THAT THERE'D BEEN SIGNED UP FOR HEALTH INSURANCE AND EXPLAIN TO THE PATIENT ALL THE COVERAGE OPTIONS. TO DO AGREED NOT TO STEER PATIENTS INTO A PARTICULAR COVERAGE OPTION. AGREE TO A PAID THE PATIENTS PREMIUMS FOR THE FULL PLAN YEAR. AND INFORM TO HELP ENSURE THAT FINANCIALLY INTERESTED ENTITY WILL PAY THE PATIENTS PREMIUM FOR THE YEAR. THE BILL ALSO HOLDS PATIENT HARMLESS BY ALLOWING THIRD PARTY PAYMENTS TO CONTINUE WITHOUT COVERAGE DISRUPTIONS AND SIMPLY REMOVES INCENTIVE. THE FINANCIAL PREFER FINANCIALLY INTERESTED PROVIDERS. A GAME THE SYSTEM FOR THEIR OWN INTEREST RECENT AMENDMENTS HAVE BROUGHT ON THE SUPPORT OF HEALTH ACCESS TO CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS. AND IS REMOVED THE OPPOSITION BY THE E. W.. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU OF SOME GOVERNMENT WONDERS. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER -- THIS BILL IS ABOUT ONE THING AND ONE THING ONLY AND THAT IS UNIONIZING THE EMPLOYEES WHO WORK AT SOME OF THESE DIALYSIS CLINICS I'VE RECEIVED. COUNTLESS EMAILS FROM MY CONSTITUENTS I WENT TO THE DIALYSIS CENTER IN MY IN MY DISTRICT TWO MILES FROM MY HOUSE AND SPOKE WITH A GENTLEMAN THERE WHO'S A HOLOCAUST SURVIVOR HE'S ONE OF THE TOUGHEST GUYS I'VE EVER MET. HE'S BEEN THROUGH A HELL OF A LOT IN HIS LIFE ME WAS IN TEARS TERRIFIED OF WHAT IS GOING ON IN THIS CAPITAL WITH RESPECT TO THEIR TREATMENT. THIS BILL IS ABOUT BACKING EMPLOYEES BACKING CERTAIN COMPANIES INDOOR CORNERS THAT THE UNIONIZED THEIR EMPLOYEES DO NOT PEOPLE THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT I URGE YOU KNOW VOTE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER HARPER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. I'M OPPOSED S. B. ELEVEN FIFTY SIX BECAUSE IT'S A BAD DEAL FOR PATIENTS AND IT'S A BAD DEAL FOR TAXPAYERS INNOCENCE S. B. ELEVEN FIFTY SIX ALLOWS PRIVATE INSURERS TO DUMP PATIENTS. FROM THE PRIVATE INSURANCE AND PUSHED THEM ON THE TAXPAYER FUNDED COVERAGE LIKE MEDICARE AND MEDICAID OUT. MANY OF THESE PATIENTS HAVE PAID PREMIUMS FOR THEIR PRIVATE HEALTH COVERAGE FOR MOST OF THEIR LIVES BUT THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN. NOW THEY'RE SIX A NEAT SECOND NEED DIALYSIS A IN REQUIRE SENDING A HELPING HAND FROM CHARITIES TO KEEP THEIR COVERAGE. S. B. ELEVEN FIFTY SIX PUSHES PATIENTS ON A MEDICAL AND MEDICARE FORCING TAXPAYERS INSTEAD OF PRIVATE HEALTH INSURERS TO PAY FOR THEIR CARE. ALL OF THIS DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE HEALTH PLANS VOLUNTARILY ENTER INTO THE CONTRACTS WITH DIALYSIS PROVIDERS PROVIDE HEALTH CARE QUIRK DIALYSIS PATIENTS. THE HEALTH PLANS CAN HAVE IT BOTH WAYS AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT AT THE HEALTH PLANS ARE ALLOWED TO DROP PATIENTS INTEREST AND RECEIVE CHAIR WILL ASSISTANCE TO PAY THEIR PREMIUMS. IT'S NOT GOOD FOR PATIENTS EITHER I URGE. YOU ALL TO VOTE NO ON S. B.. ELEVEN FIFTY SIX THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER THURMAN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MA'AM SPEAKER AMEND OUR SIDE RIGHT IN SUPPORT OF SB. ELEVEN FIFTY SIX NO MATTER WHAT YOU HAVE HEARD IN THE MATTER WHAT YOU THINK. YOU CARE ABOUT PROTECTING THE NEEDS OF OUR PATIENTS. SHOULD BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL THIS BILL SIMPLY SAYS. THAT. WE SHOULD NOT ALLOW A COMPANY TO PROFIT BY GAMING THE SYSTEM BY DIRECTING MONEY TO A CHARITY THAT PAYS FOR INSURANCE THAT FALL SHORT OF WHAT THE PATIENT NEEDS. A WHAT YOU HAVEN'T BEEN TOLD IS THAT SOMEONE WHO HAS A TRANSPLANT AND HAS THIS COMMERCIAL INSURANCE WILL NOT HAVE THE SUPPORT THAT THEY WILL NEED. FOR THREE YEARS TREATMENT THAT THEY WOULD GET AFTER THE TRANSPLANT BUT THEY HAVE MEDICARE AS THIS BILL WAS TRYING TO DIRECT PEOPLE. TO TAKE THEY WILL HAVE THREE YEARS OF ONGOING SUPPORT TO ENSURE THAT THINGS ARE GOING WELL POSTS -- TRANSPLANT AGAIN THIS BILL SIMPLY SAYS LET'S NOT ALLOW A COMPANY TO GAME THE SYSTEM TO MAKE BIG PROFITS OFF OF PATIENTS INTO LEAF PATIENTS IN THE LURCH WITHOUT THE SUPPORT. THAT THEY NEED IN THEIR TIME OF NEED I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE [inaudible] ASSEMBLYMEMBER VOEPEL. THIS BILL SIMPLY DOES NOT ADD UP ELIMINATE [inaudible] EXPLAIN WHY. 20% OF THE DIALYSIS PATIENTS HAVE PRIVATE INSURANCE. OR THEY CAN GET IT SOMEHOW ACCORDING TO WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING HERE. THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY TRUE. IF THEY DO NOT HAVE INSURANCE THEN THEY HAVE A FEW CHOICES THEY CAN GO AND GET IN INDIVIDUAL POLICY IN WHICH CASE THEY'LL BE UNDERWRITTEN. AND REFUSE COVERAGE. THEY CAN ALSO GO WITH OBAMACARE A CA WHICH IS RAPIDLY DETERIORATING. THAT'S ALSO PROBLEMATIC. MOST OF THE PEOPLE. THAT HAVE PRIVATE INSURANCE HAVE GROUP INSURANCE. OR RETIREMENT PLANS THROUGH GROUPS. IT'S ALSO SAID ON THE FLOOR HERE. THAT THESE COMPANIES ARE PAYING THE PREMIUMS. THAT'S ILLEGAL YOU CAN'T DO IT. IT'S CALLED REBATE. THAT'S ALSO COVERED IN THE INSURANCE CODE. SO I'M LOOKING AT MANY THINGS HERE THAT DO NOT ADD UP. IT CERTAINLY DON'T ADD UP TO ME. HAVE ALWAYS HAD THE PRIVATE INSURANCE IN MOST CASES. IF THERE WITH. BUT INSURANCE COMPANY THAT THEY BEN WITH FOR TWENTY THIRTY YEARS. NOW THAT THERE ARE NEXT RAMOS. AND A THREAT LIFE THREATENING. THEY WANT TO STAY WITH THAT. CARRIER THAT THEY BELIEVE IN THAT'S ALWAYS PAID THEIR CLAIMS. SO I DON'T SEE WHERE THE DECK HAS BEEN SHUFFLED HERE. FOR THE BENEFIT OF A OF A DIALYSIS COMPANY IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ALL DISCUSSION AND DEBATE HAVING CEASED ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD YOU MAY CLOSE. THEY COMMENCEMENT CARE A NEIGHBOR HEARD MANY THINGS ABOUT THIS BILL I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT I WORKED VERY CLOSELY WITH THE AUTHOR AND SUPPORTERS TO ENSURE THE VULNERABLE PATIENTS WILL NOT BE HARMED BY THIS BILL. MY DESIRE WAS TO REMOVE THE FINANCIAL INCENTIVE THAT HAS ALLOWED FOR PROFIT TREATMENT CENTERS. TO INAPPROPRIATELY BENEFIT FROM THE SYSTEM. I BEEN TO SUIT MADE AT THE TO SAY THE LEAST THAT SOME OPPONENTS OF THIS BILL HAVE HAD YET DIE I HAVE HAD THE AUDACITY. TO ARGUE THAT THIS BILL PRESERVES INSURANCE COMPANY PROFITS. INSURANCE COMPANIES ACTUALLY HAVE A MEDICAL LOSS RATIO PLACE THAT LIMITS THEIR PROFITS. CAN THE SAME BE SAID FOR PROP FOR PROPAGANDA CENTERS NO THAT CAN'T BE. THEY'RE ACTUALLY FUNDING MONEY THROUGH THIS THROUGH IS THROUGH A FOUNDATION TO HELP PAY FOR PEOPLE'S PLANS. HE'S PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES HAVE A VIRTUAL MONOPOLY ON THE DELIVERY OF CARE. THE NET WORTH OF THESE COMPANIES APPROXIMATELY TWO BILLION DOLLARS. THIS BILL WILL HAVE A DIRECT IMPACT ON 1% OF THEIR PATIENTS THE 1% RECEIVING PREMIUM ASSISTANCE. IS A CHANGE TO THE RIGHT MEDICARE RATES FOR THIS 1% OF PATIENTS GOING TO DEVASTATE THEIR BUSINESS OR IS IT JUST GOING TO HAVE A BIT OF AN IMPACT. ON BILLION DOLLAR PROFITS I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MADAM CLERK YOU MAY OPEN THE ROLL-ON MEMBERS VOTE. THE DESIRE TO VOTE. ALL MEMBERS VOTER DESIRE TO VOTE. ALL MEMBERS VOTE.

FOR THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE CHARGED WITH HOMICIDE THE MAJORITY WERE NOT THE PRIMARY ACTOR AND LIKELY TO HAVE HAD AN ADULT CHO CO DEFENDANT. THIS BILL ENSURES THAT THE YOUNGEST TEAMS IN OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS BUT ALSO RECEIVE AGE APPROPRIATE SERVICES AND PROGRAMS. TO REBUILD TAPE THEM INTO HEALTHY AND MATURE ADULTS THOSE WHO COMMIT THE MOST HEINOUS AND SERIOUS CRIMES WILL STILL BE PUNISHED THROUGH INCARCERATION AT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUVENILE JUSTICE. WHICH IS PRISON WITH AGE APPROPRIATE AND REHABILITATIVE SERVICES WITHOUT A RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR VOTE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER CARILLO YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER COLLEAGUES I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SB THIRTEEN NINETY ONE BY SENATOR LOTT AT THIS BILL ENSURES THE CALIFORNIA RETURNS TO PRIORITIZING REHABILITATION AND POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT. FOR FOR YOUTH WE CANNOT SPEAK OF THIS BILL AS IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE CALIFORNIA DID NOT ALWAYS TRY FOURTEEN AND FIFTEEN YEAR OLDS AS ADULTS. IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR CALIFORNIA CHANGE THE LAW TO ALLOW YOUTH UNDER SIXTEEN TO BE TRIED AS ADULTS THESE POLICIES WERE CREATED IN AN ERA WHERE WE WERE AFRAID OF YOUTH CRIMES AND WE REACTED BY SPREADING AND BELIEVING THE MYTH. OF THE SUPER PREDATOR WE CANNOT. FULL OF COLOR BROWN AND BLACK YOUTH. TRY IT AND THE SYSTEM FOR ADULTS WHERE THEY WILL NOT GET THE SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED TO REHABILITATE. RESEARCH HAS DEMONSTRATED THE YOUTH ARE DEVELOPMENTALLY DIFFERENT FROM ADULTS AND CAPABLE OF REMARKABLE CHANGE GIVEN THE PROPER SERVICES AND SUPPORT. pBASED ON SOLID EVIDENCE AND RESEARCH NOT FEAR OR HYSTERIA AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS BILL THAT WOULD CHANGE THE LIVES OF SO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE THINK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER JONES SAWYER THANK YOUMADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS ARE RISE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF SB. THIRTEEN NINETY ONE AT YOUR PUBLIC SAFETY AND AND THE BOARD MET BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR I'VE SEEN FIRST INTERFERE IN THE EYES OF OUR USE THAT THEY TRIED TO COME TO GRIPS WITH FACING TIME. IN AN ADULT PRISON MANY OF THESE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE IN THIS POSITION BECAUSE A SOME KIND OF TRAUMA. OR ABUSE THAT THEY HAVE EXPERIENCED WHICH WENT UNTREATED WE OFTEN OFTEN HEAR ABOUT THE VERY GREGIS IN SERIOUS CASES IN THE NEWS. BUT THAT IS NOT THE RATIONALE FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE USED ME AND SENT TO THE ADULT SYSTEM. ABOUT 70% OF THE U. WHO ACTUALLY GET SENT TO THE ADULT SYSTEM ARE FOR NON HOMICIDE CRIMES. OF THESE 92% OF YOUTH OF COLOR WE KNOW THAT A YOUNG PERSON'S BEST CHANCE OF REHABILITATION IS IN THE JUVENILE SYSTEM. CHILDREN DON'T BELONG IN THE ADULT SYSTEM IS FOR THESE REASONS THAT I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS MEASURE TODAY AND I URGE ALL OF YOU TO SUPPORT THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER MELENDEZ YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER SO LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WE'VE HEARD MUCH ABOUT -- THE DEFENDANTS IN CASES LIKE THIS SO NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT THE ACTUAL VICTIMS. OKAY WE HEAR TIME AND TIME AGAIN ON THIS FLOOR ABOUT. THE YOUTH ABOUT HOWELL THEIR UNFAIRLY TARGETED THEIR UNFAIRLY INCARCERATED. NOBODY TALKS ABOUT THE VICTIM. WHEN THE ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEYS IN IN MY DISTRICT TOLD ME THIS STORY ABOUT A DEFENDANT? THAT WITHIN HIS COURT ROOM HE THE KID WAS FIFTEEN YEARS OLD HE SAID THAT WAS THE ONE DEFENDANT HE WAS MOST AFRAID OF A YOUNG MAN WHO LOWERED A YOUNG WOMAN. THAT HE DOES FRIENDS NEW. THEY WERE ACQUAINTANCES THAT SHE LORD OR BOARD HER. TO AN ABANDONED HOME. SET HER ON FIRE. AMONG MANY OTHER HORRIBLE DISGUSTING AWFUL THINGS THAT THEY DID TO HER. AND KILLED HER HE WAS FIFTEEN YEARS OLD IT WAS PREMEDITATED. THIS IS THE TYPE OF CASE THAT MIGHT LEE AND ONE IN IN IN IN ADULT COURT [inaudible] RATHER THAN. THE JUVENILE COURT. IT IS UNUSUAL. THAT A MINOR WOULD BE TRIED AS AN ADULT AND DON'T QUIT THIS IS NOT HAPPEN ALL THE TIME USED IN. VERY EXTREME CIRCUMSTANCES -- THIS ISN'T HAPPENING EVERYDAY AND I THINK YOU OUGHT TO THINK VERY CAREFULLY. ABOUT THE VICTIMS IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND LISTEN A LITTLE LESS. ABOUT WHAT TYPE OF CHILDHOOD THE DEFENDANT MIGHT OF HAD AND THINK ABOUT THE CHILDHOOD. THAT SOME OF THESE VICTIMS WILL NEVER HAVE. WITH THAT I URGE YOU KNOW VOTE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER HARPER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS. IT'S EASY TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT TEENAGERS ARE NOT AS RESPONSIBLE AS ADULTS HOWEVER WHEN TEENAGERS COMMIT VIOLENT FELONIES THEY SHOULD BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS. THIS BILL LIMITS THE DISCRETION PROSECUTORS HAVE IN HOW THEY PROSECUTE FELONIES COMMITTED BY JUVENILE OFFENDERS AGE FOURTEEN FIFTEEN YEARS OLD BY PREVENTING PROSECUTORS FOR BRINGING CHARGES. THAT THESE OFFENDERS ARE AN ADULT -- OR IN ADULT COURT. EXISTING LAW ALREADY SAFEGUARD JUVENILE OFFENDERS ALLOWING HEARINGS TO DETERMINE A MINER'S FITNESS FOR ADULT COURT IN. TWENTY SIXTEEN VOTERS PASSED PROPOSITION FIFTY SEVEN WHICH FURTHER RESTRICTED PROSECUTORS ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO TRY JUVENILES IN ADULT COURT. PROPOSITION FIFTY SEVEN REPEALED THE PRESUMPTION OF FITNESS FOR ADULT COURT FOR JUVENILE OFFENDERS MAKING THE PROSECUTION OF JUVENILE OFFENDERS IN ADULT COURT INCREDIBLY RARE IN RESERVE. FOR ONLY THE MOST HEINOUS OF CRIMES. IN DETERMINING OFFENDERS FITNESS FOR ADULT COR A COULD JUDGE CONSIDERS THE CIRCUMSTANCES THE GRAVITY AND THE SOPHISTICATION OF THE OFFENSES COMMITTED BY THE MINOR. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE PRESERVE THE CURRENT SYSTEM WHICH THE VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA ALREADY SUPPORT BY ALLOWING JUDGES TO DETERMINE AN OFFENDER'S FITNESS ON A CASE BY CASE. BASIS IT IS OUT THAT MANY OF THOSE THESE MOST HEINOUS OF CRIMINALS WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR PAROLE POTENTIALLY AT AGE TWENTY FOUR I I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM LAKE ELSINORE WHO BROUGHT UP THE SUBJECT OF WHERE THE VICTIM'S RIGHTS. IN THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION WE NEED TO BE CONCERNED WITH SPECIFIC DETERRENCE BY MAKING SURE THAT THESE MOST HEINOUS OF CRIMINALS ARE BEHIND BARS AND NOT ABLE TO RECOMMIT. THEIR CRIMES. THIS BILL MAKES OUR CITIES. OUR ROLE AREAS AND AREAS THROUGHOUT THE CAL STATE A CALIFORNIA NEED MORE DANGEROUS LESS SAFE. LET'S REJECT THIS BILL AND VOTE NO. ASSEMBLY MEMBER ALLEN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THIS BILL IS CRIMINAL. THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW JUVENILES AGE FOURTEEN AND FIFTEEN GUILTY OF MURDER [inaudible] ARSON [inaudible] VIOLENT RAGE [inaudible] KIDNAPPING [inaudible] TORTURE. NO LONGER BE TRIED AS ADULTS. UNDER THE MISTAKEN [inaudible] FANTASY. THEY WERE SOMEHOW [inaudible] NOT RESPONSIBLE. WE'RE NOT ABLE. TO UNDERSTAND THE SEVERITY OF THEIR ACTS. PLEASE CHEN WHILE TELL YOU RIGHT NOW VERY CLEARLY. I DON'T CARE. AND NOR SHOULD ANYONE THIS BODY. WORD A CITIZEN OF THIS COUNTRY HERE. IF THEY WERE AWARE. OR NOT AWARE. OF THE SEVERITY OF THEIR ACTIONS. WHEN THEY MURDERED [inaudible] FORCIBLY RAPED. TORTURED AND KIDNAPPED VICTIMS. THESE ARE CRIMES. THESE ARE THE WORST CRIMES THAT WE KNOW OF THESE PERPETRATORS. OF THESE CRIMES. SHOULD FACE THE MAXIMUM POSSIBLE PENALTIES. THEY SHOULD BE HELD TO FULL ACCOUNT. FOR THE ACTIONS OF THEIR NEEDS. AND I WILL TELL YOU RIGHT NOW THESE PERPETRATORS OF THE WORST CRIMES THAT WE KNOW OF POSSIBLY BE ELIGIBLE FOR PAROLE. WITHIN A DECADE. IS NOT ONLY THE JUSTICE. TO THE VICTIMS OF THESE CRIMES IT'S AN INJUSTICE. TO OUR ENTIRE SOCIETY JUVENILES. THERE ARE FOURTEEN AND FIFTEEN THE COMMITTING THE WORST CRIMES. SHOULD BE TREATED AS ADULTS. THEY SHOULD FACE. THE FULL COURT SYSTEM. AND THE FULL SYSTEM OF JUSTICE IN CALIFORNIA. THE VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA GREEN. SENSIBLE PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA AGREE. VICTIMS RIGHTS ADVOCATES AGREE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGREES. DON'T LET JUSTICE TURN A BLIND EYE [inaudible] SIMPLY BECAUSE THE PERPETRATORS. ARE SLIGHTLY YOUNGER. THESE ARE THE VERY WORST CRIMES. WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT MINOR OFFENSES. AND THINK FOR A MOMENT IF ANY OF THESE CRIMES WAS BE PERJURY AGAINST YOU OR ANYONE THAT YOU KNOW. WOULD YOU WANT. THE PERPETRATOR OF THIS CRIME. BACK OUT ON THE STREET. WITHIN A DECADE. OR AT ALL. VOTE NO ON THIS BILL. THINK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER SHOPPERS. YOU KNOW I'VE A STRUGGLE OVER THIS BILL [inaudible] AND NOW [inaudible] IT. AND MAYBE BECAUSE IN THE SIX YEARS I'VE BEEN HERE I'VE TAKEN THE TIME TO VISIT A SOME PRESENCE. I'VE TAKEN THE TIME TO GO SEE SOME THE JUVENILE SYSTEMS. AND MY BACKGROUND AS SOME OF YOU MAY KNOW IS AT FIRST SEVEN YEARS I WAS A DIRECTOR OF A CHARTER SCHOOL. IN IN THIS CHARTER SCHOOL THOSE BETWEEN DIVIDING LOS AND THESE TWO COMMUNITIES ARE ALWAYS AT OF AB FIGHTING EACH OTHER YOU'RE TALKING. FOURTEEN AND FIFTEEN YEAR OLD KIDS. BUT AT THE SCHOOL WAS A SAFE SPOT. AND THAT THE SCHOOLS WITH THE PLACE I WOULD SEE HIM GET TOGETHER AND INDIVIDUAL YOU SEE ON THE STREET WHAT ACT A CERTAIN WAY WOULD NOT THE SAME WAY IN THE SCHOOL. I SIGH KIDS RISE UP TO THEIR OCCUPATION THERE BILLY DO GREAT THINGS. ONE OF THE SADDEST EVENTS I HAD IN MY TIME IS A SCHOOL THAT IS ONE YOUNG MAN WHO WAS A BIG KID. AND OVER THE SUMMER TIME HE HE HAD COME TO US BECAUSE HE WAS BASICALLY KICKED OUT THE OTHER SCHOOLS. BUT HE CAME TO SCHOOL ANY WAS STUDYING HE WAS WARNING ME WAS UNDERSTANDING HIS ROLE WITHIN SOCIETY.

IT'S EASY TO SAY. YOU KNOW THERE ARE DAHLE SIR MAKING MISTAKES. YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE THESE KIDS ARE COMING FROM WHAT EXPERIENCES ARE GOING THROUGH. HE WASN'T AN EVIL KID HE WAS IN THE WRONG PLACE AT THE WRONG TIME. BECAUSE YOU IS THE BIG GUY GOT IN THE MIDDLE OF IT. YOU KNOW WE LOST A GREAT LEADER WE PUT HAVE MANAGERIAL. WE AS A SOCIETY. NEED TO LOOK AT OUR PRESENT SEE HOW MANY PEOPLE WE ON TRACK CARCERI SEE WHO'S IN THERE SEE WHAT'S GOING ON WITHIN HOURS. IN OUR SCHOOLS AND OUR FAMILIES AND TAKE A BROADER VIEW THE EASIEST THING IN THE WORLD IS IT TAKES SOMEBODY AND THROWN IN JAIL AND SAY TO HELL WITH YOU. THAT'S THE EASIEST THING TO DO. THE HARDEST THING TO DO IS TO FIND OUT WHY ARE THEY THERE HOW CAN I HELP THEM AND I'VE SEEN COUNTLESS OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE COME BACK AND SAY. I WAS A LITTLE THOUGHT I WAS A GANG MEMBER BUT IN THE SYSTEM OF THE JUVENILE COURTS IT TOOK AWAY MY TATTOOS I LEARNED HOW TO READ I LEARNED OF VALUES. AND I WANNA BE PART OF THE SOCIETY THEY'VE BEEN IN MY OFFICE AND I KNOW THEY'VE BEEN IN YOUR OFFICES [inaudible] MEMBERS. LET'S TAKE A BROADER VIEW OF WHAT THE SOCIETY IS ABOUT. WE HAVE A PROBLEM OUR PRISON SYSTEM WE HAVE A PROBLEM IN A JUDICIAL SYSTEM. I JUST WANT PEOPLE AWAY BECAUSE OF THEIR EXPERIENCES IS WRONG. I'M STRONG SUPPORTING THIS BECAUSE I BELIEVE WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IN THE PAST ISN'T WORKING. WE NEEDED CHANGE US LET'S GO TO THE FUTURE AND GIVE THE YOUNG WOMEN AND MEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO CORRECT THERE'S THAT THEY'VE MADE. I WAS A LITTLE FOG ONE TIME. YOU PROBABLY WERE. LET'S GET MY BREAK [inaudible] THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER EGGMAN. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER I ALSO RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB.

NEVER HANGING IT'S ALWAYS THE FRIENDLESS AND THE POOR WHO FACE THE GALLOWS [inaudible] MEMBERS. WE HAVEN'T CHANGED OUR SYSTEM THAT TERRIBLY MUCH WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TODAY TO SAY TO OUR YOUNG PEOPLE WE HAVE SET UP SERVICES FOR YOU WE HAVE REHABILITATED OUR SYSTEM SO THAT THERE ARE PROGRAMS. AND SERVICES IN JUVENILE FACILITIES TO HELP YOU TURN YOUR LIFE AROUND. YOUR WORTH REDEMPTION I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE [inaudible] THANK YOU. ASSEMBLYMEMBER GIPSON YOU'RE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM SPEAKER MEMBER. I WASN'T GOING TO SPEAK ON THIS ITEM BUT I FEEL COMPELLED TO SPEAK ON THIS ITEM -- FIRST WELL LAST MY COLLEAGUES WHO AYE VOTE IN THIS BILL -- ONE I SPEAK AS A AS MANY OF YOU KNOW AS A FORMER POLICE OFFICER. AND THEN. TO FOR A FATHER WHO LOST. THEIR CHILD WHO WAS KILLED. THE ADULT WOMAN WHO HE KILLED OUR SON. WAS AN ADULT WOMAN. SHE WAS IT. FOURTEEN A FIFTEEN BUT THE COMMUNITY IN WHICH I WAS RAISED IN. HAD A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT OBSTACLES WITH PEOPLE GROWING UP YOUNG PEOPLE. BUT I DON'T WANT YOU TO HEAR SOMETHING A STORY ABOUT A YOUNG MAN WHO I JUST MET HIM OFFICE JUST THIS WEEK. THIS YOUNG MAN [inaudible] GREW UP. WITHOUT A FATHER. THIS YOUNG MAN GREW UP GETTING INVOLVED IN GANGS AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE. HANNA ROUGH AND TOUGH LIFE GROWING UP. HE DID SOMETHING HE WASN'T SUPPOSED TO HAVE DONE. AND HE WAS SENTENCED AS A JUVENILE. TWO TWENTY THREE YEARS. WELL YOU KNOW WHAT HE DID IN THOSE AND WHEN HE WAS INCARCERATED. HE TOLD ME HE READ THE ENTIRE NEW TESTAMENT. FRONT AND BACK. HE ALSO TOLL ME THAT IT WAS BECAUSE OF THE PEOPLE THAT WITH IN AND THAT WAS WORKING WITH TO THOSE INDIVIDUAL SAW SOMETHING IN HIM THAT HE DID NOT SEE WITHIN HIMSELF. HE HAD A SECOND CHANCE ON LIFE. SOME OF YOU IN THIS ROOM KNOW ABOUT GRACE AND MERCY AND YOU WOULD NOT BE HERE AFTER GRAYSON MERCY WITH ALL YOUR LIFE. AND WHAT THIS BILL TALKS ABOUT. IS GIVEN IN APPLYING SOME GRACE AND MERCY TO FOURTEEN AND FIFTEEN YEARS OLD WHO HAVE MADE MISTAKES IN THEIR LIVES. WHO NOW HAVE A SECOND CHANCE TO GET A [inaudible] RIGHT. THOSE INDIVIDUALS WE'VE ALL MADE MISTAKES SOME OF THOSE NEVER GOT CAUGHT FOR THE MISTAKES WE'VE MADE. AND WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT GIVES THESE YOUNG PEOPLE ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY YES. I UNDERSTAND WHAT MY COLLEAGUE WAS SAYING IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW HIDEOUS CRIMES MURDERS AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE NOT UNDERSTAND THAT. NO ONE UNDERSTANDS IT MORE THAN I DO WHO LOST A CHILD. BUT THESE INDIVIDUALS NONE OF YOU ARE HERE. WILL MAKE THE SAME MISTAKES THAT YOU DID WHEN YOU WERE. FOURTEEN AND FIFTEEN YEARS OF AGE. AND SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY IS A LOW THESE YOUNG PEOPLE TO RUN A NEW STORY. TROUT A NEW CHAPTER IN THEIR LIVES GIVE THEM THAT OPPORTUNITY GIVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET IT RIGHT. TO COMMENT CONTACT TO SEE SOMETHING THAT THEY CAN SEE WITHIN HIMSELF THE SOMEBODY ELSE ALL WITHIN SADDAM'S WITHOUT ONE SIDE THEMSELVES. IT'S SO THIS BILL REPRESENTS THAT OPPORTUNITY AND THAT CHANCE SO RESPECTFULLY ASK WHAT ARE VOTE. ON THREE FORTY FOUR THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOM EUROPE. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER I DIDN'T I TO RISE TO SPEAK. IN FAVOR OF SB THIRTEEN NINETY ONE AND I WANT TO START BY REJECTING [inaudible] RESOUNDINGLY REJECTING THIS NOTION THAT ANY. PERSON WHO SITS ON THIS FLOOR SOMEHOW DOES NOT CARE ABOUT VICTIMS OF CRIME. THAT IS ABSOLUTELY OUTRAGEOUS IT'S A CANARD AND IT HAS NO APPLICABILITY HERE. I'D ASK YOU INSTEAD TO THINK ABOUT CHILDREN. WHO HAVE IN FRONT OF THEM TO DO WORSE [inaudible] ONE DOOR LEADS FROM A CHILDREN'S WORLD. TO ADULT. PRISON WORLD. A COMPLETELY FOREIGN WORLD FOR ANY OF THESE CHILDREN. AND WE KNOW WHAT LIES DOWN THAT PATH. BECAUSE MIXING CHILDREN IN THAT WORLD LEADS THEM. TO A LIFE IN PRISON THAT WILL HAVE NO AND IN THAT LEADS TO NO GOOD. EVEN IF THEY GET OUT OF PRISON BECAUSE IT WILL AFFECT THEM. SO SO DEEP IN THEIR SOULS THE OTHER DOOR LEADS TO A WORLD OF POSSIBILITIES AND NOT EVERYBODY WHO ENTERS THAT DOOR. IS NECESSARILY GOING TO RESTORE THEIR LIVES. BUT I'D LIKE TO A A TELL YOU ABOUT AN EXPERIENCE I HAD ONLY A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO. WHEN I WENT -- TO VISIT THE INCIDENT COMMAND CENTER FOR THE CAR FIRE. A FIRE THAT THAT THAT DESTROYED HOMES THAT HAS -- RESULTED IN TAOS AND THEY'RE AT THE INCIDENT COMMAND CENTER. WERE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WERE RESTORING THEIR LIVES WHO ARE PRISON INMATES. WHO WANT TO DO SOMETHING PRODUCTIVE AND WANT TO RETURN TO SOCIETY AND BE PRODUCTIVE HUMAN BEINGS AND IN THIS FOR THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE? THAT THIS BILL IS SO IMPORTANT. AND FOR THEM THAT I URGE YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEBER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES SAW LIKE SO MANY I HAD NOT INTENDED TO SPEAK I FELT THAT. MUCH OF THE MESSAGE WAS CLEAR. UP WITH REGARDS TO IT BUT I JUST WANNA SOMEHOW ANOTHER REMIND US THAT. WE CAN NOT CONTINUE DOWN THE SAME PATH THAT WE'VE GONE FOR THE NUMBER OF YEARS. I MEAN WE KNOW THAT IF WE CONTINUE DO THE SAME THING THAT WE'VE ALWAYS DONE WILL GET THE SAME RESULTS. NONE OF US CAN PROBABLY STANDING SAY THAT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN FAIR. HAS BEEN JUSTIN HAS BEEN EFFECTIVE IN KEEPING US SAFE. WE FEEL NO SAFER BY INCARCERATING YOUNG PEOPLE AT THE AGE OF FOURTEEN TO FIFTEEN OR NOT INCARCERATING HIM. EIGHT FOURTEEN FIFTEEN WE CAN'T SAY THAT WE FEEL COMFORTABLE IN OUR HOMES THAT WE'VE DONE THE RIGHT THING IN THIS SENSE. WE'VE DONE NOTHING BUT BUILT AT A PRISON SYSTEM INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX IN TERMS OF OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT MOST OF US SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF BUT WE HAVE INCARCERATED PEOPLE FOR LONGER PERIODS OF TIME. WE HAVE DESTROYED FAMILIES AND CHILDREN WE'VE TAKEN AWAY THE FOUNDATION OF SO MAD MANY HOME SIMPLY BY INCARCERATION. WE CONDEMN YOUNG PEOPLE EARLY IN LIFE AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT WHEN YOU DO THAT THERE IS NO POSITIVE RESULT THE WEEK THAT COMES OUT OF IT. A PERSON IS BROKEN FOR MANY MANY YEARS IF THEY EVER RECOVERED THEMSELVES. IN MY OTHER LIFE I USED TO SING IN PRISONS. AND I WENT TO LOTS OF PRISONS EVERY SUNDAY AT DIRECTOR ACQUIRE THAT WENT TO PRISONS WHERE PRISON MINISTRY. AND I HAVE THE UNFORTUNATE PLEASURE OIL OR FORTUNATE IN SOME SENSE TO MEET SOME YOUNG PEOPLE WOULD BEEN INCARCERATED FOR TEN FIFTEEN YEARS. AND TO WATCH THEIR BEHAVIOR. THE FACT THAT THEY HAD MISSED OUT ON SO MUCH OF LIFE. SMALL THINGS THEY WOULD BASICALLY IMMATURE NO THINKING. BUT ALSO HAD BEEN ABUSED SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. AND IT WAS NOT A PRETTY PICTURE. AND I REALIZE IS THAT SEVERAL OF THEM THAT I SAW WHO WOULD IN A FIFTEEN AND SIXTEEN AND NOW WE KNOW THIRTIES. THAT WAS THE TRAGEDY THAT WE HAVE LOST A LIFE. AND I FIRMLY BELIEVE IS A NATION AND A STATE WE CAN DO BETTER. WHEN HOUSING GOT A ONE TIME I WOULD TO THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT TO OBSERVE WHAT THEY WERE DOING? AND WAS REALLY QUITE INTERESTING BECAUSE THEIR ASSUMPTION IN A SOCIETY. IS THAT WHEN THEIR CHILDREN DO THINGS THAT ARE WRONG. IT IS A DIRECT REFLECTION UPON THE FAMILIES FROM WHICH THEY COME. AND THEY'VE BEEN BEGIN TO WORK WITH THE FAMILY AND THE CHILD IN THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM TO RESTORE THAT FAMILY AND RESTORE THE CHILD BACK TO BEING A PRODUCTIVE CITIZEN. THEY DON'T INCARCERATE THEM AND THROW THEM AWAY THAT SEVERAL THE SOAPS FACILITIES IN OUR CROWD THAT I VISITED. AND IT WAS INTERESTING TO WATCH THE YOUNG PEOPLE AS THEY BEGIN TO TALK ABOUT WHAT WAS MISSING IN THE LIVES OF THE FAMILY WAS MISSING IN THE LIVES OF OF THE CHILDREN AND WHAT SKILLS WERE DEVELOPED FOR THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE AND TRYING TO RESTORE NOT JUST THEM. BUT RESTORE THEIR FAMILIES BACK TO BEING [inaudible] THEY BELIEVE THESE CHILDREN ARE REALLY THE PRODUCT OF THEIR FAMILIES AND IF THE TRUCK TOGGLES ASTRAY THE MAYBE TO WORK TO RESTORE THE FAMILY AND THE CHILD. I WAS MOST IMPRESSED WITH THAT SYSTEM BECAUSE I SAW YOUNG PEOPLE BEING RESTORED AND I SAW FAMILIES BEING RESTORED AND I SAW WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN IN A CIVILIZED SOCIETY. WE CAN AND WE MUST DO BETTER. WE CANNOT CONTINUE DOWN THIS PATH AND TO HAVE THE VICIOUS IDEA THAT WE CAN JUST THROW PEOPLE AWAY BECAUSE WE DON'T CARE WE CARE ABOUT THE VICTIM WE CARE ABOUT THAT THE PERSON WHO'S PERPETRATED THE CRIME WAS NOW GOING TO BE A VICTIM OF THE SYSTEM. WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO WORK HARD TO RESTORED TO GIVE OUR CHILDREN WHAT THEY NEED. AND WE CAN TALK ABOUT ALL THE IMPACT WE TALK ABOUT ALL THE ISSUES MOST OF THESE KIDS AND I HAVE POOR LITERACY SKILLS WE'VE DONE A POOR JOB IN EDUCATING THEM IN OUR SCHOOLS. WE KNOW THAT YOU KNOW WHO IT EITHER THEY'RE NOT AT SCHOOL ARE THEY NOT COMING OR SOMETHING'S GOING WRONG THEIR FAMILIES A WORKING WITH POOR INCOME THEY HAVE LIMITED RESOURCES THAT THEY HAVE TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR CHILDREN. MANY OF THESE HOMES KIDS ARE COMING FROM UNSTABLE ENVIRONMENTS WITH IT BEING EVICTED FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE AND HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ELSE. THE BOTTOM LINE IS THESE ARE OUR CHILDREN. AND THEY A DIRECT PRODUCT OF WHAT WE HAVE BUILT AS A SOCIETY FOR OUR FAMILIES AND WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO TRY TO NEVER GIVE UP ON THEM AND TO WORK TO RESTORE THEM BACK TO FULL CITIZENSHIP OF FULL PARTICIPATION IN SOCIETY. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOU AYE BOTH WITH THIRTEEN NINETY ONE BECAUSE CLEARLY WE CAN AND WE MUST DO BETTER THAN WE'VE DONE THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA MATTER SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES ON MOTIVATED BUT AT THE SAME TIME SOUND THAT WERE SPEAKING TO HALF OF ROOM. OF LEGISLATORS WHO ARE NOT HERE. TO TAKE IN THE DEPTH OF THIS CONVERSATION. I'M ALSO YOU KNOW ONE IN THERE JUST COMMEND OUR COLLEAGUE FROM OCEANSIDE [inaudible] FOR SPEAKING. TRUTH TO POWER AS MY PREDECESSOR WOULD SAY. FROM COACHELLA. HE HIT THE NAIL RIGHT ON THE HEAD. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT [inaudible] YOUNG CHILDREN [inaudible] TALKING ABOUT. CHILDREN WHOSE MINDS ARE CONTINUING TO DEVELOP AS RESEARCH. TIME AND TIME AGAIN HAS DEMONSTRATED. THAT IT ISN'T UNTIL YOUR MID TWENTIES. BRAIN HAS FULLY DEVELOPED. WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE COGNITIVE NEED REASONABLE THESE DECISIONS. I GOTTA TELL YOU. I'M HERE BECAUSE OF OPPORTUNITIES THAT I'VE RECEIVED. AS I'D LIKE TO MENTION THAT THREE OR FOUR SECOND CHANCES. THAT WERE HANDED TO ME. TO BE ABLE TO TURN TO PAGE. AND BE ABLE TO FULFILL. THE GOALS AND ASPIRATIONS OF MY PARENTS AND OF COURSE THOSE THAT WE'VE SET FORWARD TO BE ABLE TO BE. PRODUCTIVE CITIZENS IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND PROBABLY REPRESENT. OUR DISTRICT BUT THIS REALLY. IS ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT WE DON'T GET. IN ALL SHAKEN UP BY THE WILLIE HORTON. SCARE TACTICS THAT WE SEE THAT BECAUSE WE BOTH. FOR PEOPLE AND ARE CONSIDERATE ABOUT PEOPLE'S LIVES IN THE IMPACTS ON THE LONG TERM. THAT THESE TYPES OF POLICIES COULD HAVE OR NOT. BY NOT SUPPORTING A BILL LIKE THIS. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CHILDREN. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FIFTEEN AND SIXTEEN YEAR OLD WE'RE NOT SAYING THAT THEY SHOULD NOT BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. WE'RE JUST SAYING BUT THEY SHOULD NOT BE TREATED LIKE ADULTS. AND PUT INTO A SYSTEM. WHERE WE WILL SEE? DETRIMENTAL AFFECTS. AND ULTIMATELY SEE AN INDIVIDUAL RETURNED BACK INTO THE INSTITUTION. AND THE FINAL OUTCOME OF THAT IS SOMEONE WHO UNFORTUNATELY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO INTEGRATE THEMSELVES BACK INTO OUR COMMUNITIES. AND BE A PRODUCTIVE CITIZEN OF OUR COMMUNITIES I'VE SEEN THAT FIRST HAND [inaudible] GROWING UP. IN THE BODY HEALS OF PORCELLO WHERE. MY BEST FRIENDS WHO LIVED ACROSS THE STREET THEIR MOTHER SOLD HEROIN [inaudible] A FATHER [inaudible] DOMESTIC ABUSER. NOW WHAT CHANCES DOES THAT YOUNG PERSON HALF. TO BE ABLE. TO GO ON A POSITIVE TRAJECTORY. AND ULTIMATELY HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES THAT MANY OF US HAVE HAD [inaudible] UNFORTUNATELY. THEY GOT NO LEG UP. THOSE ARE THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MANY YOUNG PEOPLE OF COLOR. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ARE IMPACTED BY. I HAVE A FIFTEEN YEAR OLD. AND HIS MOTHER AND I HAVE CALL PARENTED HIM FOR THE LAST AND CREDIT TO HER FOR THE WORK THAT SHE'S DONE TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT BOY IS ON TRACK AND ON POINT. BUT I GOTTA TELL YOU I THINK ABOUT HIM EVERY SINGLE DAY. AND I THINK BACK TO THE THINGS THAT I GOT TO SEE AN EXPERIENCE WHEN I WAS FIFTEEN YEARS OLD AND I WOULD NEVER. EVER WANT HIM TO BE PUT IN THOSE TYPES OF PREDICAMENTS AND BECAUSE MAYBE BEING AT THE WRONG PLACE AT THE WRONG TIME. HANGING OUT WITH SOMEONE. ONE AFTERNOON AND SOMETHING TERRIBLY GOES DOWN. MY SON ALTHOUGH YOU SEEN HIM HE'S A LITTLE TALLER THAN ME HE'S GOT A BIGGER MUSTACHE THAN HALF OF YOU HERE HE'S A LITTLE KID. SITTING IN FRONT OF THE VIDEO GAMES. DOING HIS HOMEWORK. YEAH EVERY NOW AND THEN IS A TEENAGER WHO KINDA GETS A LITTLE SNAPPY HIM THERE BUT HE'S A LITTLE BOY. AND I CAN IMAGINE HIM BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE OR RESPONSIBLE FOR INACTION WHERE HE'S TREATED LIKE AN ADULT. THAT'S NOT RIGHT. AND SO THAT'S WITH HIS BILL IS ABOUT. IS GIVING PEOPLE AN OPPORTUNITY. TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE AND RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS BUT DONE SO IN A WAY IN WHICH IT WILL REGISTER IN THEIR MIND. AND PERHAPS SAID AMONG THE TRAJECTORY. TO BE PRODUCTIVE CITIZENS OF OUR COMMUNITY THAT'S WHY SUPPORT HIS BILL RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT ALL OF YOU DO. TOO THANK YOU I SEE NO FURTHER REQUEST TO SPEAK I WILL RETURN TO MR CHIU FOR HIS CLOSING BECAUSE THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND LET ME THANK ALL OF YOU FOR ENGAGING IN THIS INCREDIBLY. IMPORTANT DISCUSSION. AND LET ME JUST TAKE A FEW MOMENTS TO SEPARATE RHETORIC FROM FACT -- TO OUR COLLEAGUES FROM HUNTINGTON BEACH WHO ARE SUGGESTING THAT ALL OF THESE CHILDREN. ARE MURDEROUS. THAT SIMPLY IS NOT TRUE AS I SAID IN MY OPENING. YOU APAMA GROUNDS ARE YOU OBJECTING -- YOU KNOW I MIGHT BUY ASSESSMENT OF THIS BILL THE INCOME PISSED MURDERERS WHO HAVEN'T BEFORE DINNER FIFTEEN YEARS OLD AND IT WAS JUST MIS CHARACTERIZED BY THE AUTHOR QUE I DON'T SEE A GROUNDS FOR OBJECTION THAT'S NOT A POINT OF ORDER LET'S RETURN. IS NOT WELL TAKEN WILL RETURN TO MISTER TO THE RHETORIC THAT WAS USED TO OPPOSE THIS BILL IS SUGGESTING THAT MANY OF THESE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE MURDERS. THAT IS SIMPLY NOT TRUE THREE QUARTERS OF THESE YOUNG PEOPLE. HAVE NOT COMMITTED THE CRIME OF HOMICIDE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BURGLARY ROBBERY AND ASSAULT. TO OUR COLLEAGUE FROM ELSINORE WHO SUGGESTING THAT SOMEHOW IF WE SUPPORT THIS WE ARE NOT SUPPORTING VICTIMS. I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYONE IN THIS CHAMBER WHO DOES NOT STAND A 1000% FOR VICTIMS. AND THE SUGGESTION THT SOMEHOW VICTIMS. ARE NOT GETTING THEIR FAIR DAY. THE DIVISION OF JUVENILE JUSTICE WHERE A FOURTEEN AND FIFTEEN YEAR OLD WOULD GO IF THEY DON'T GO TO ADULT PRISON IS PRESENT. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT YOUNG PEOPLE WERE GONNA BE SPENDING MANY MANY YEARS. BEEN INCARCERATED BUT AT LEAST THEY'RE BEING INCARCERATED IN THE ENVIRONMENT WHERE THERE AGE APPROPRIATE SERVICES TO ADDRESS IT. BULLETS TALK ABOUT FUTURE VICTIMS IF THE GOAL OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY SYSTEM. IS TO TRY TO BRING DOWN THE NUMBER OF FUTURE VICTIMS THE STATISTICS ARE CLEAR. IF YOU'RE FOURTEEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS OLD AND YOU GO TO STATE PRISON AND YOU DO YOUR TIME AND YOU COME OUT YOU ARE MORE LIKELY TO COMMIT CRIMES WE ARE LESS SAFE. I WANNA JOIN IN THANKING THE COURAGE OF OUR COLLEAGUE FROM OCEANSIDE. FOR YOUR PERSPECTIVE YOU REFER TO YOURSELF AS SOMEONE IN YOUR EARLIER DAYS AS A LITTLE THOUGHT. WHO MAY HAVE MADE SOME DECISIONS YOU DID NOT WANT AND YET TODAY YOU STAND HERE? ON THE FLOOR OF THE STATE ASSEMBLY. THAT'S THE KIND OF SYSTEM THAT WE WANT TO BUILD.

WE GOT TO GO TO COLLEGE WE GOT TO GO TO LAW SCHOOL WE GOT TO BECOME LEGISLATORS AND OTHERS DID NOT. LET ME AND WITH A FEW QUESTIONS I WANNA ASK EVERYONE TO THINK ABOUT THIS IF YOU ARE NOT DECIDED YET ON THIS BILL. WHEN YOU WERE? FOURTEEN WHEN YOU WERE FOURTEEN DID YOU MAKE [inaudible] EVERY DECISION. THE SAME WAY YOU WOULD MAKE THAT DECISION WHEN YOU'RE AN ADULT. IF YOU HAVE A FOURTEEN YEAR OLD SON OR DAUGHTER.

SIXTY THREE THE PROP SIXTY THREE OF INITIATIVE MANDATES THAT COUNTIES MUST SET ASIDE 20% OF FUNDS YOU PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES TO STOP THE CYCLE OF UNTREATED MENTAL ILLNESS. THESE PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION FUNDS ARE CRUCIAL. REAL CHANGE COMES WHEN WE FOCUS MORE RESOURCES ON INTERVENING AT STAGE ONE BEFORE PEOPLE'S LIVES SPIRAL OUT OF CONTROL. THERE'S FAR MORE WE COULD BE DOING TO ENSURE THAT. THE MONEY CALIFORNIA SPENDS ON PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION PROGRAMS NEARLY HALF A BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. HAS A MEASURABLE IMPACT. HOWEVER THERE ARE CURRENTLY GLARING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE GAPS ACROSS CALIFORNIA WAS SOME COUNTIES HAVING COMPREHENSIVE PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION PROGRAMS. WHILE OTHERS DO NOT. S. B. ONE THOUSAND FOUR ESTABLISH IS A STATEWIDE STRATEGY FOR THE PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION FUNDS COUNTIES RECEIVE EACH YEAR WHILE IMPROVING REPORTING DATA.

ONE THOUSAND FOUR HAS RECEIVED ZERO NO VOTES AND I ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER KILEY YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AS A CO AUTHOR OF THE SITE MEASURE I URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR IMPROVING THE DELIVERY OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN CALIFORNIA. OVER TWO POINT TWO MILLION CALIFORNIANS HAVE A MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS. AYE AND BUT OVER HALF REPORT THAT THEY DO NOT RECEIVE ANY TREATMENT FOR A PRIMARY CARE DOCTOR OR A MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL. THAT'S OVER A MILLION CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE NOT GETTING THE HELP THAT THEY NEED. AND WE ALL KNOW HOW TRAGIC THE CONSEQUENCES OF UNTREATED MENTAL ILLNESS CAN BE. FROM HOMELESSNESS TO DROPPING OUT OF SCHOOL TO UNEMPLOYMENT TO IMPRISONMENT. NOW IN ONE WAY OR STATE'S RESPONSE TO THE SCALE OF THIS PROBLEM AYE HAS BEEN CLEAR AND THAT IS TO PROVIDE A LOT MORE FUNDING. I OVER THE LAST DECADE WE'VE SEEN BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN NEW TAXES GOING TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. BUT IN THE WAY THAT REALLY MATTERS OUR RESPONSE HAS BEEN ALTOGETHER INADEQUATE. AS REPORT AFTER REPORT FROM THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION AND THE STATE AUDITOR HAVE SHOWN AND WHAT SOUNDED THE ALARM ABOUT THE QUESTIONABLE RESULTS WERE GETTING FOR ALL OF THE SPEND. THIS BILL IS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. IT PRIORITISES MENTAL HEALTH ACCESS FOR KIDS AND TEENS. WE KNOW THAT 50% OF ALL LIFE TIME PIECES OF MIT MENTAL ILLNESS BEGIN BY THE AGE OF FOURTEEN WE ALSO KNOW THAT SUICIDE IS THE THIRD LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH. IN USED AGES. TEN TO TWENTY FOUR THIS BILL HELPS TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE BY PROVIDING MORE GUIDANCE TO COUNTIES ON HOW BEST PRIORITIZE PREVENTION INTERVENTION FUNDING PROVIDED BY THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THAT. IT REQUIRES THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION TO INCLUDE CHILDHOOD TRAUMA INTERVENTION EARLY PSYCHOSIS DETECTION SUICIDE PREVENTION AND COLLEGE MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS IN A STATEWIDE STRATEGY FOR COUNTIES TO FOLLOW. THERE IS STILL MUCH MUCH MORE THAT WE NEED TO DO BUT THIS BILL IS AN IMPORTANT STAFF AND I URGE AND I BET. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER ARAMBULA THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. I RISE AS A PROUD CO AUTHOR OF SENATE BILL ONE THOUSAND AND FOUR I BELIEVE THAT DRAMA PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION IS CRUCIAL FOR THE MENTAL HEALTH. OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE AND OUR COMMUNITIES. AND USING OR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT FUNDING FOR THIS IN EACH COUNTY WOULD ALLOW US TO CLOSE CLICK GAPS IN TREATMENT AND ACCESS THAT WE ARE SEEING ACROSS THE STATE. BOLSTERING PREVENTATIVE CARE IS AN EFFECTIVE USE OF OUR STATE FUNDING AND IS FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE BECAUSE IT ALLOWS US TO INVEST IN LESS EXPENSIVE DETECTION. AND INTERVENTION EARLY ON SO THAT WE DO NOT FACE COSTLY EXPENSES FOR LATE TREATMENT OF AVOIDABLE CAUSES. THEREFORE I URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR SENATE BILL ONE THOUSAND AND FOUR THINK YOU I SEE NO FURTHER REQUEST TO SPEAK I WILL RETURN TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER MULLIN FOR ANY CLOSING COMMENTS.

THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I AM PROUD 2% SP ONE TWENTY ON BEHALF OF SENATOR ROTH A BILL TO ENHANCE PROTECTIONS OVERSTATES DESERT BY CREATING A PROCESS FOR THE STATE TO ASSESS PROPOSALS. TO EXPORT DOES OUR GROUNDWATER TO OTHER AREAS OF THE STATE. THERE IS A NEED FOR GREATER STATE OVERSIGHT A PROJECTS THAT SEEK TO TAKE WATER OUT OF THE DESERT AND SEND IT TO OUR URBAN AREAS. LAST YEAR I WAS SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT A PROJECT IS PROPOSING TO EXTRACT FIFTY THOUSAND ACRE FEET OF WATER ANNUALLY FROM BENEATH THE MOJAVE DESERT. AND EXPORT THE WATER TO WATER AGENCIES OVER TWO HUNDRED MILES AWAY WHEN THE UNITED STATES GEOLOGICAL SURVEY INDICATED THAT IT CAN ONLY SUSTAIN A MAXIMUM TEN THOUSAND ACRE FEET. DESPITE THE US DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR'S LONGSTANDING CONCERNS ABOUT THE EFFECT THIS PROPOSAL WOULD HAVE A NATURAL SPRINGS IN THE MOJAVE. THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION REVERSED LONGSTANDING POLICIES INTENDED TO ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS. CONSIDERING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS ABDICATED ITS RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT ITS PUBLIC LANDS IN THE MOJAVE THE STATE HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THE REVIEW THAT WAS ORIGINALLY INTENDED TO TAKE PLACE BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. BEFORE AUTHORIZING A PROJECT THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT SUCH A FRAGILE ECO SYSTEM. FURTHERMORE CONSIDERING THE CONFLICTING ESTIMATES ON THE AMOUNT OF WATER THAT CAN BE SUSTAINED ONLY SIXTEEN A PLEA ATTRACT EXTRACTED A SERVER PROVIDED BY COULD THESE THE PROJECTS APPLICANT. AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S FIGURES THE STATE MUST CONDUCT SCIENTIFIC ANALYSIS BEFORE ALLOWING THE EXTRACTION OF WATER FROM THE DEAD THIS DESERT AQUIFER. IF IT IS FOUND THAT THE REGION CAN SUSTAINABLY SUPPLY FIFTY THOUSAND ACRE FEET OF WATER ANNUALLY THEN LET'S AUTHORIZES PROJECT IN ALLOWED TO MOVE FORWARD. HOWEVER WE MUST ENSURE THE SCIENTIFIC REVIEW THAT WE ARE EXPECTING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. TO UNDERTAKE IS COMPLETED FIRST IF WE'RE GOING TO MAKE AN EDUCATED DECISION. YESTERDAY AND THE NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE WANTS SENATOR ROTH PRESENTED THIS BILL. HE SAID SOMETHING INTERESTING HE SAID YOU KNOW I DON'T CONSIDER MYSELF TO BE AN ENVIRONMENTALIST I GENERALLY DON'T LIKE A LOT OF GOVERNMENT BUREAUCRACY HE SAID. BUT WE ONLY HAVE ONE SHOT WHEN IT COMES. TO THIS AQUIFER IS NOT COVERED BY SIGMA AT THE SUSTAINABLE GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT ACT THAT THE REST OF THE AQUIFER IN THE STATE. ARE A BARGE A SUBJECT TO TO WE KNOW THAT A FOR GROUND WATER AQUIFER IS OVERDRAWN IT CAN COLLAPSE AND WE NEVER GET IT BACK AGAIN. SENATOR ROTH ASKED ALL OF THE PARTIES OVER AND OVER AGAIN HE SAID IF THIS FAILS ARE YOU GONNA BE RESPONSIBLE ARE YOU GONNA BE RESPONSIBLE ARE YOU GONNA BE RESPONSIBLE. NONE OF THEM SAID THEY WOULD TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT RESPONSE. OR THAT -- AND TAKE IT ON THEMSELVES. THE STATE THIS THIS AQUIFER IS SURROUNDED BY EXTREMELY FRAGILE PROTECTED FEDERAL LANDS AND WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY AS CALIFORNIA TO MAKE SURE THAT NO PROJECT DOES ANY HARM TO THOSE LANDS. I WILL ALSO POINT OUT THAT THIS IS NOT JUST AN ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE I'VE EVER FROM NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES IN THE CALIFORNIA DESERT ABOUT THE CRITICAL IMPORTANCE OF WATER AND SPRINGS. AND HOW LOSING THOSE SPRINGS WOULD BE DEVASTATING TO THEIR CULTURES THEY ARE STRONGLY IN FAVOR OF THIS BILL. I HAVE ALSO HEARD FROM CALIFORNIANS UP AND DOWN THE STATE ABOUT THE NEED TO PROTECT OUR BELOVED CALIFORNIA DESERT. WITHOUT I WOULD URGE AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU [inaudible] MR LEVINE. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THE HEARSE MISS THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS THE MOJAVE DESERT IS ONE OF THE MOST ARID REGIONS IN NORTH AMERICA IT RECEIVES LESS ANNUAL PRECIPITATION THEN THE SONORAN. DESERT IN GREAT BASIN YET OVER FOUND IN THE MOJAVE AS WELL AS MUCH WILDLIFE INCLUDING A NUMBER. OF ENDANGERED SPECIES AND IMPERILED SPECIES ANY PROPOSAL TAKE WATER FROM THIS EXCEEDINGLY DRY. ECOSYSTEM THAT STILL MANAGES TO THRIVE WITH PLANTS AND WILDLIFE MUST BE SUBJECT TO THE UTMOST SCRUTINY POSSIBLE. CLIMATE CHANGE WILL LIKELY TO DISRUPT THE DESERT'S ECOLOGICAL BALANCE EVEN FURTHER IN THE YEARS TO COME WHICH IS ANOTHER REASON THAT THE WATER PROJECT THAT IS THE SUBJECT OF AB ONE TWENTY WARRANTS MORE EXAMINATION. TO THE BEST PEER REVIEWED SCIENCE THIS BILL WILL HELP ENSURE THIS PROJECT RECEIVES THE THOROUGH SCIENTIFIC REVIEW THAT ABSOLUTELY NEEDS AYE URGING AYE VOTE [inaudible] MR MURATSUCHI [inaudible] HERE RECOMMENDS. A COLLEAGUE SAID WE HEARD THIS IMPORTANT BILL AND NATURAL RESOURCES AND THE NATIONAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE YESTERDAY. THIS BILL IS -- SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR TO A BILL THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN INTRODUCED LAST YEAR. ARE A BILL THAT RECEIVED A RARE LETTER OF SUPPORT FROM GOVERNOR BROWN. WHERE HE TALKED ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING? TIGHTENED REVIEW TO PROTECT THE PROCESS AND SENSITIVE ECOSYSTEM THAT WE HAVE IN THE MOJAVE DESERT. SO WE HAVE. OUR STRONG INDICATION THAT THIS IS A STRONG SUPPORTER BY GOVERNOR BROWN. THIS BILL IS ALSO ARE SUPPORTIVE WE RECEIVED LETTERS AND FROM LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR GAVIN NEWSOM. FROM UNITED STATES SENATOR DIE AND ALL HIGHLIGHTING THE THAT THE FACT THAT THIS IS A TOP PRIORITY FOR OUR STATEWIDE LEADERSHIP. I URGE. MY COLLEAGUES TO SUPPORT THIS BILL [inaudible] YOU BROKE [inaudible] YOUR RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. SP ONE TWENTY SIX TO PROHIBIT THE KIDDIES PROJECT AND PROPOSES TO ELIMINATE THE SUPPLY OF WATER. THAT CAN MEET THE NEEDS OF FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS ANNUALLY. THIS PROJECT IMPROVES THE LOCAL WATER SUPPLY RIBAT RELIABILITY. AND REDUCES DEMAND FOR IMPORTED WATER FROM THE DELTA AND THE COLORADO RIVER. COULD EASE IS CLOSER TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA POPULATION CENTER SO LESS ENERGY IS NEEDED TO MOVE THE WATER. THIS WILL HELP MANAGE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ENERGY MAN'S REDUCE EMISSIONS AND STABILIZE WATER RATES. THIS PROJECT WILL CREATE NEW GROUND WATER STORAGE OPPORTUNITIES IMPROVE THE WATER QUALITY BY LOWERING THE SAW CONTACT. FROM THE COLORADO RIVER. THE PROJECT WOULD CREATE SPORT OVER FIFTY NINE HUNDRED JOBS GENERATE MORE THAN EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN THE INLAND EMPIRE. INCLUDING FIVE POINT FOUR MILLION PER YEAR FOR THE SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY BUDGET. THE ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW PROJECTS THAT PROCESS HAS BEEN EXTENSIVELY REVIEWED PERSEVERANCE SEQUEL. TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN THE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THE SANTA MARGARITA WATER DISTRICT WHICH IS A WATER DISTRICT IN MY DISTRICT. CONDUCTED AN EIGHTEEN MONTH PUBLIC REVIEW PROCESS DURING WHICH INFORMATION WORKSHOPS EDUCATIONAL SEMINARS PUBLIC HEARINGS WERE HELD. TO ENCOURAGE DIALOGUE FROM THE COMMITTEE IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE FOLLOWING YEARS OF ANALYSIS FIELD STUDIES PUBLIC REVIEW. SANTA MARGARITA WATER DISTRICT CERTIFIED THE FINAL III ARE. FEDERALLY AND APPROVE THE PROJECT UNDER SEQUEL THE FBI ARE SUMMARIZED THE PROJECT WOULD AVOID ANY SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS TO DOESN'T RESOURCES. INCLUDING CRITICAL RESOURCES OF THE DESERT ENVIRONMENT SUCH AS VEGETATION MOUNTAIN SPRINGS WATER AND AIR QUALITY. ALSO AS A RESPONSIBLE AGENCY UNDER SEQUESTRATION BERNADINE OF THE GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT MODERATING AND MITIGATION PROJECT. 200-012-2000 TWELVE AND THIRTEEN APPROVALS OF THE KIDDIES PROJECT WERE CHALLENGED IN COURT [inaudible] THESE CASES WERE WITHDRAWN OR OTHERWISE DISMISSED AND SIX PRECEDED THE TRIAL IN. TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN THE ORANGE COUNTY SPIRIT COURT DENIED ALL THE SEQUEL CLAIMS AGAINST THE PROJECT AND UPHELD THE PROJECT'S ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW. AND APPROVALS THESE RULINGS WERE APPEALED TO THE CALIFORNIA COURT OF APPEALS FOURTH DISTRICT. AND THAT WAS UPHELD IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN AND IN THE COURT CASE. IT WAS CLEAR THAT THE GROUND WATER PLAN. WAS TO AVOID [inaudible] ADVERSE IMPACTS. AN UNDESIRABLE RESULTS TO THE REGION INCLUDING. GROUND WATER AQUIFERS TAPPED BY THE PROJECT. LOCAL SPRINGS BRIAN RESOURCES IN BRISTOL AND COULD THESE DRY LAKES AIR QUALITY VEGETATION IN THE MOJAVE DESERT REGION AND ALSO AFFECTED ADJACENT AREAS. ALONG THE COLORADO RIVER AND ITS TRIBUTARIES. THIS WOULD ADD TWO MORE REVIEWS TO THE SECRET PROJECTS DISREGARD DE THOROUGH SECRET PROCESS THAT WAS APPROVED. TIME AND TIME AGAIN WE GO BACK TO SEE QUIRK AND WE DEMAND PROJECTS GO THROUGH IT. SOME WE EXEMPT FROM SEQUEL BUT THIS ONE WAS APPROVED BY SEQUEL WHICH IS THE GOLD STANDARD AND NOW WE'RE SAYING. THAT IT'S NOT. IF THIS PROJECT COULD RESULT IN THE SIX POINT ONE BILLION DOLLAR SAVINGS AND AVOID COSTS OVER A FIFTY YEAR PERIOD DISTANCE DOT AFFECT ANY OF THE SACRED MONUMENTS IN THE DESERT. THIS IS BAD PRECEDENT ANY OTHER PROJECT IN YOUR DISTRICT TO GOES TO SEE GROW. ONE DAY SOMEBODY COULD COME AND SAY NOT THAT WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH LET'S DO IT AGAIN I ASK FOR NO THE MR OBERNOLTE. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER COLLEAGUES TO DISS IN MY DISTRICT. SO I KNOW A LOT ABOUT THIS PROJECT. AND I ASSURE YOU IT IS EXTRAORDINARILY COMPLEX. THERE ARE A LOT OF ISSUES TO CONSIDER HERE. I HAVE TO OBJECT TO THIS BILL JUST. ON THE BASIS OF THE PROCESS WERE FOLLOWING. IF YOU THINK ABOUT THIS. WE'VE GOT A PRIVATE PARTY THAT OWN SOME PRIVATE LAND AND THEY HAVE INVESTED MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. IN TRYING TO DEVELOP A PROJECT. THEY'VE GONE THROUGH EXHAUSTIVE REVIEW BOTH ENVIRONMENTALLY AND OTHERWISE THEY'VE GONE FOR REVIEW BY THE COUNTY SAN BERTINO THEY'VE BEEN REVIEWED -- WITH SEQUEL WITH US ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT THEY'VE GOT A FILE A FEDERAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT THAT THEY'VE GONE THROUGH. ITS TAKEN THEM YEARS AND YEARS TO GET TO THIS POINT. AND AT THE VERY LAST MINUTE. WE'RE GONNA PULL THE RUG OUT FROM UNDER THEIR FEET. AND TELL THEM THAT THEY HAVE TO DO MORE THEY CAN'T GO FORWARD THAT'S WRONG. REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE FOR THE PROJECT OR AGAINST THE PROJECT THAT'S WRONG. THAT DOESN'T GIVE THOSE PART OF THOSE PEOPLE DUE PROCESS AND IT'S DEPRIVING THEM OF THE FAIR USE OF THEIR PROPERTY. IT'S NOT RIGHT TO INTRODUCE A BILL THE LAST WEEK OF SESSION AND RAM RAILROADED THROUGH HERE. WERE WERE VOTING ON IT THE DAY AFTER IT FIRST PASSED OUT OF COMMITTEE. LET ME POINT OUT ALSO THAT WE HAVE THE SIMILAR BILL THAT WE HEARD LAST YEAR. THAT BILL WENT THROUGH APPROPRIATIONS. THIS BILL HAS GONE THROUGH APPROPRIATIONS ONE NOT. WE'RE BEING ASKED TO VOTE ON THIS PRECIPITOUSLY WITH NO DELIBERATION AND I ONE OBJECT TO JUST ON GENERAL PROCESS SO PLEASE VOTE NO ON THIS. AND IF WE WANT TO HAVE A REASON DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS PROJECT AND LET'S DO THAT. WHAT'S COME BACK NEXT YEAR AND WILL SIT DOWN AND WHATEVER REASON PROCESS THAT FOLLOWS THE RULES. AND NOT DISOBEYS EVERY RULE THAT WE HAVE THIS CHAMBER AS THIS LEGISLATION HAS PLEASE VOTE NO. STERN HARPER. HERE RIGHT NOW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. I RISE TO OPPOSE S. B. ONE TWENTY BECAUSE IT RUNS ROUGHSHOD OVER PROPERTY RIGHTS. CURRENTLY SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO TRANSFER WATER CANNOT BE DENIED THE USE OF A WATER CONVEYANCE FACILITY PROVIDED THAT THERE IS UNUSED CAPACITY IN THAT FACILITY. AND FAIR COMPENSATION IS PAID FOR THAT USE. THE KIDDIES WATER PROJECT AS POINTED OUT BY MY COLLEAGUE FROM OUT DANA POINT. PROPOSES TO PUMP AND THEN TRANSFER FIFTY THOUSAND ACRE FEET PER YEAR AT LEAST PARTIALLY TO THE COLORADO RIVER AQUEDUCT OPERATED BY THE METROPOLITAN WATER DISTRICT. AND IT WOULD INDEED. SERVE MANY OF THE FOLKS WHO ARE IN MY DISTRICT AS WELL AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM DANA POINT IN SOUTHERN ORANGE COUNTY. AND WE'VE ALSO HEARD THE VIEWPOINT FROM MY COLLEAGUE FROM BIG BEAR LAKE THAT REPRESENTS THE AREA IN PARTICULAR. BUT BY PROHIBITING THIS TRANSFER FOR THE KIDDIES PROJECT THIS BILL PROPOSES TO ELIMINATE A SUPPLY OF WATER THAT COULD MEET THE NEEDS. FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE ANNUALLY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THE PROJECT WATER SUPPLIES COULD RESULT IN SIX POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN SAVINGS. AND AVOIDED COSTS OVER A FIFTY YEAR PERIOD. THESE BENEFITS WOULD NOT ONLY BE REALIZED BY THE PROJECT SUBSCRIBERS BUT EXPERIENCED BY ALL WATER USERS THROUGHOUT THE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA REGION BECAUSE OF COURSE. THIS IMPACTS ALL OF US IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ARE NEED FOR WATER. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY THIS IS PRECEDENT SETTING WELL THIS BILL CONTINUES. OR PERTAINS TO THE COULD THESE WATER PROJECT IT SETS THE TABLE FOR FUTURE LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS TO MAKE END RUNS AROUND SI KHOA. AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM DANA POINT. POINTED OUT. THEY HAVE SPENT THE MONEY. I GET THE APPROVALS UNDER THE PROCESS AND ALL THIS DOES IS IT JUST CRUMPLES UP THAT PAPER AND THROWS IT OUT. INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT IN OUR STATE IS KEY WHETHER IT'S ENERGY WHETHER IT'S WATER WHETHER IT'S TRANSPORTATION. BUT IF WE'RE GOING TO PULL THE RUG FROM UNDER OUR PROJECTS LIKE THIS. WE SHOULD SAY GOODBYE TO ANYBODY WHO WANTS TO INVEST IN CALIFORNIA FOR INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS LIKE THIS BECAUSE THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO TRUST THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AFTER YOU PUT IN THE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE APPROVALS. HERE WITHIN THIS STATE. I GET IT THAT THIS PROJECT MIGHT NEED NOT BE POPULAR AMONG SOME OF THE MAJORITY. MIGHT NOT BE POPULAR MAKING A PURPLE UP A PARTICULAR U. S. SENATOR. THAT IS NOT RIGHT. FOR US TO PULL THE RUG FROM UNDER THIS PROJECT IN THIS WAY IT IS WRONG. IT IS UNFAIR. AND IT IS OWN SHOTS. AND FRANKLY I'M SURPRISED. THAT SO MANY WOULD TRY TO TURN THEIR BACKS ON THESE PRINCIPLES WITHIN THIS BODY I STRONGLY URGE A NO VOTE ON THIS UNDERHANDED BILL [inaudible] MS WALDRON [inaudible] YOUR RECORD. KIM MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RISE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. BY PROHIBITING THE TRANSFER OF THE KIDNEYS PROJECT THIS BILL PROPOSES TO ELIMINATE A SUPPLY OF WATER. THAT CAN MEET THE NEEDS OF FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE ANNUALLY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA LET ME REPEAT THAT FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ANNUALLY -- AS A MEMBER FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ONE OF THE BIGGEST ISSUES IN MY DISTRICT IS WATER. AND THE VEIL ABILITY OF WATER -- IN A REASONABLE PRICE THAT AFFECTS ALL OF US IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES. OUR HOMES THE ABILITY TO GROW OUR NEIGHBORHOODS. AND WATER ALON'S SO. THIS IS -- IF TO TWENTY YEARS THE PROJECT HAS FINALLY GOT A PATH TO MOVE FORWARD. AND NOW THIS BILL ARRIVES. TAKING A PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS THE PROJECT IS ALL ON PRIVATE LANDS NOT PUBLIC LANDS. THIS BILL SO ITS A PRECEDENCE THE COULD NEEDS PROJECT HAS ALREADY BEEN THROUGH THE SEQUEL PROCESS NOW ADDING ANOTHER STEP TO SEEK WHILE. THIS CAN HAPPEN TO ANY WATER INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT OF THIS BILL HAVE PASSES DO WE REALLY WANT TO STOP SITES RESERVOIR TEMPERANCE FLAT. THE DIESEL PLANTS THAT ALREADY TAKE LONG ENOUGH IN MY DISTRICT TO BE IN MY AREA TO BE APPROVED. THIS PROJECT INCREASES CALIFORNIA'S WATER SUPPLY. KILLING THIS PROJECT WILL INCREASE PRESSURE ON CALIFORNIA'S ALREADY STRESSED WATER RESOURCES IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. THE LAST THING WE SHOULD BE DOING IS REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF WATER AVAILABLE TO OUR CITIZENS ARE FARMS. AND OUR ECONOMY'S I URGE A NO VOTE. THANK YOU MISS WALDRON. MR CHOW YOUR RECOGNIZE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MS SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB. ONE TWENTY S. B. ONE TWENTY N. SURE IS THAT THE CALIFORNIA STATE LANDS COMMISSION AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. MAKE A FINDING THAT THE TRANSFER WILL OF WATER FROM THE UNDERGROUND BASE IN UNDERLYING DESERT LANDS WILL NOT ADVERSELY AFFECT. THE NATURAL OR CULTURAL RESOURCES OF FEDERAL OR STATE LANDS PRIOR TO THE TRANSFER BEING ALLOWED. THE DESERT ECOSYSTEM AND KNOW MOJAVE DESERT IS EXTREMELY FRAGILE. SMALL CHANGES CAN HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS I'M CONCERNED THAT THERE HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT STUDIES THAT RANGE WIDELY AND POTENTIAL IMPACT. THAT COULD THESE PROJECT COULD HAVE ON THE ECOSYSTEM. HAVING THE ADDITIONAL STUDY OF A PROJECT AFFECTING STATE LANDS ESPECIALLY FOR FRAGILE. DESERT ECOSYSTEMS IS APPROPRIATE. SO WE DON'T INADVERTENTLY CAUSE IRREPARABLE HARM. S. B. ONE TWENTY FULFILLS THAT GO. WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR IDEA. NAME IS CHAU. DOCTOR WEBER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND AND MEMBERS. I RISE ALSO IN SUPPORT OF THE THE PIECE OF THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION SB. ONE TWENTY AND I DO THAT WITHOUT WITH UNDERSTANDING AT LEAST IN MY MIND THAT -- WHEN I WAS APPROACHED BY FOLKS WITH THE COULD THESE PROJECT I WAS INITIALLY IN FAVOR OF WHAT THEY WERE SAYING? BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN PROCESS AND PROCEDURE AND THAT WHEN YOU AGREE TO A CERTAIN PROCESS IN A PROCEDURE YOU LIVE BY THAT PROCESS AND PROCEDURE. AND I WAS LED TO BELIEVE THAT EVERYTHING WAS IN LINE AND EVERYTHING WAS CORRECT. UNTIL I GOT A COPY OF THE TIMELINE. AND I REALIZE THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAD REQUIRED AN ADDITIONAL REPORT TO BE DONE THE NEPA. OUT TO BE DONE ON THIS PIECE OF PROPERTY. AND IT WAS IN PLACE TO BE DONE UNTIL OBVIOUSLY ADMINISTRATIONS CHANGED. AND THE LAWS IN THE A CONCERN THE ENVIRONMENT WERE RELAXED. AND THEREFORE THEY WOULD THEN TAKE IT OUT OF THE NEPA PROCESS A BECAUSE OUR CURRENT PRESIDENT. DID NOT OBVIOUSLY OVERTURNED A LOT OF THINGS THAT OBAMA PUT IN PLACE AND ONE OF THINGS PUT IN PLACE WAS THE STUDY FOR THE NEPA BEEPER. OF STUDY TO BE DONE ON THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT. AND BECAUSE THAT WAS IN PLACE IN MY MIND THAT ALSO DEFINED THE RULES OF THE GAME. AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THEN THOSE RULES CHANGE WE GET A NEW PRESIDENT WHO THEN DECIDES TO RELAX ALL THE STANDARDS AND REMOVE THEM FROM THIS PROJECT TO DO THE LAST STUDY THAT'S DONE. SO NOT THAT I'M. NOT AS KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT OTHERS WITH REGARD. FARMERS IN THE WATER IN THIS SO ON BUT I DO BELIEVE IN PROCESS IN THE GAMES AT A BEER. AND THIS GAME WAS IN PLACE FOR THEM TO DO THIS FINAL REPORT. BUT BECAUSE THEY ONE OF THE PERSONS WHO NOW IS ON THE INTERIOR COMMITTEE IS ONE OF THE OWNERS ARE ADVOCATES OF OF OF THE COULD THESE. THIS WAS THEN TAKEN OFF THE LIST AND THEN PUT ON A HIGHER LISTS OF BASICALLY TO ALLOW THIS PROJECT TO MOVE FORWARD WITHOUT DOING NEPA. TO ME THAT'S UNFAIR. THE PROCESS WAS IN PLACE I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT AND THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN PREPARED TO DO IT AND FOR THAT REASON AS WE LOOK DEAL WITH AN ADMINISTRATION THAT CONTINUES TO WANT TO RELEASE. AND TO ROUTE TO RELAX ALL OF THE PROCESSES CONCERNING THE ENVIRONMENT I'M IN FAVOR OF THIS BECAUSE IN CALIFORNIA WE BELIEVE AND PROCESS AND WE BELIEVE IN STUDIES THAT WE BELIEVE IN LOOKING CAREFULLY AT THE ENVIRONMENT. AND EVEN THOUGH YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH SEQUEL THERE OTHER PROCESSES THAT YOU HAVE TO GO TO PEOPLE WAS ONE AND THIS REQUIRES THAT TO TAKE PLACE I RESPECTFULLY ASK WHEN I BOTH SB. ONE TWENTY THANK YOU DOCTOR WEBER. THANK YOU MEMBERS. MISTER SPEAKER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS MEMBERS I WHEN I AUTHORED THE WATER BOND IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN I SPENT.

THIS IS FILE ITEM. THREE FORTY SEVEN SENATE BILL. FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN THE CORKERY SAMPLE FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN BY SENATOR SKINNER AND ACTUALLY THE MURDER [inaudible] MR MEDINA. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. TODAY I RISE TO PRESENT SENATE BILL. FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN A BILL THAT LIMITS MURDER PROSECUTIONS. PEOPLE WHO INTENDED TO KILL ACTUALLY KILL. AIDED AND ABETTED A MURDER. OR BEHAVED WITH RECKLESS INDIFFERENCE TO HUMAN LIFE. BY DOING SO S. B.. FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN REFORMS CALIFORNIA'S EXISTING LAW. BY MAKING CLEAR THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS -- PARTICIPATED. IN AN UNDERLYING CRIME FROM INDIVIDUALS. CHOSE TO TAKE SOMEONE'S LIFE. OR DIRECTLY AIDED AND TAKING OF THAT LIFE [inaudible] IN CALIFORNIA. PERSON CAN BE CONVICTED OF MURDER. FACE LIFE IN PRISON. WITHOUT KILLING ANYONE. OR EVEN OR EVEN WITNESSING THE MURDER. UNDER WHAT'S CALLED. THE FELONY MURDER RULE. A FEW DAYS AGO I HAD THE PLEASURE OF MEETING [inaudible] BOBBY GARCIA. IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO BOBBY GARCIA WAS SIXTEEN YEARS OLD. HE WAS LIVING A ROUGH LIFE. MAKING BAD CHOICES THE GROUPS OF FRIENDS THAT HE HUNG OUT WITH GROUP OF FRIENDS. MADE THE TERRIBLE DECISION. TO ROB A GANG MEMBER. IT WASN'T UNTIL BOBBY WAS PICKED UP BY THE POLICE. AND INTERROGATED THE NEXT DAY. THEN HE LEARNED THAT ONE OF HIS FRIENDS STAB AND KILL. THE ROBBERY VICTIM. AFTER THEIR HAD ALL FLED THE ROBBERY. BOBBI HAD NO INTENTION. A MURDER IN ANYONE. HE DID NOT COMMIT THE MURDER. HE HAD NO WEAPON ON HIS PERSON. AND HE WAS NOT EVEN AT THE SCENE OF THE CRIME. YET HE WAS FACING ALIVE SENTENCE WITHOUT PAROLE. UNDER THE FELONY MURDER RULE. BOBBY WAS TOLD. THAT IF HE PLED GUILTY. HE WOULD AVOID LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE. AT THE AGE OF SIXTEEN HE WAS GIVEN TWO OPTIONS. THE JURORS FOR ORDER PLEASE MEMBERS. IT'S GIVE MR MEDINA YOUR UNDIVIDED ATTENTION. AT THE AGE OF SIXTEEN WHO WAS GIVEN TWO OPTIONS. SPEND THE REST OF HIS LIFE IN PRISON. OR PLEAD GUILTY AND HAVE THE POSSIBILITY [inaudible] A PAROLE. HE PLED GUILTY [inaudible] TODAY. THE YOUNG MAN THAT I MET BARBARA BOBBY GARCIA. IS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR. OF THE JESUIT. STORAGE OF JUSTICE. INITIATIVE. AND PROVIDES COUNSELING TO INCARCERATED MEN AND WOMEN THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. BOBBY IS MARRIED WITH TWO DAUGHTERS. AND A THREE YEAR OLD. IN A TWO MONTH OLD. TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN BOBBY WAS RELEASED FROM CALIFORNIA PRISON. AFTER SERVING TWENTY TWO YEARS. FOR A MURDER HE DID NOT COMMIT. IN. NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT. CALLED THE FELONY MURDER RULE BARBARIC. BECAUSE IT DIVORCED INTENT FROM RESPONSIBILITY. THE JUSTICES SAID. ONLY THE LEGISLATURE COULD FIX THE PROBLEM. TIME TO FIX THE PROBLEM. IS NOW. THIS STATUE RATIONALLY TREATS PEOPLE. WHO DID NOT COMMIT MURDER? THE SAME WAY IT TREATS PEOPLE WHO DID COMMIT MURDER. THE FELONY MURDER RULE IS NOT ONLY AND JUST ON HIS FACE. IT IS UNJUST IN ITS APPLICATION. THIRTY SECONDS OF US MILLION AVERAGE AGE OF A NON KILLER SENTENCE UNDER FELONY MURDER IS BETWEEN NINETEEN AND TWENTY YEARS OLD. 72% OF THE WOMEN SERVING LIFE SENTENCES FOR MURDER AND CALIFORNIA WERE NOT THE KILLER. THEY WERE CONVICTED UNDER THE FELONY MURDER RULE. BEFORE I STARTED TEACHING IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS I TAUGHT AT THE CALIFORNIA INSTITUTION FOR WOMEN I MET MANY WOMEN WHO HADN'T KILLED ANYONE. BUT WE'RE REMORSEFUL. BUT THEY WERE INCARCERATED UNDER THIS RULE. I STAND TODAY IN SUPPORT OF SB. FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN BECAUSE IT PRESERVES THE HARSHEST PUNISHMENT FOR THOSE WHO INTENTIONALLY PLANNED OR ACTUALLY COMMITTED THE BURGER. THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE LIKE BOBBY WHO WERE INCARCERATED UNDER THIS RULE WHO NEVER COMMITTED MURDER AND ARE READY FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. TO ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR PORTION OF THE CRIME. S. B. FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN IS NOT A GET OUT OF JAIL FREE CARD FAR FROM IT. EACH DEFENDANT CAN STILL BE CHARGED AND IS STILL GUILTY. OF THE SERIOUS FELONY HE OR SHE COMMITTED. AND THOSE WHO PETITIONED FOR RE SENTENCING. ACCESSIBLE WILL ALSO BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THE UNDERLYING FELONY. PLEASE PLEASE INCLUDE A SERVANT MEDINA. I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON S. B. FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN THANK YOU MISS MEDINA MS RUBIO. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I STAND IN SUPPORT OF SB. FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN MEMBERS ACCORDING TO A TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN SURVEY BY THE ANTI RECIDIVISM COALITION AND RESTORED JUSTICE 72% OF WOMEN SERVING A LIFE SENTENCE UNDER CALIFORNIA'S FELLA FELONY MURDER RULE. WERE NOT THE PERPETRATORS AND DID NOT COMMIT MURDER. MANY OF THOSE CASES. WOMEN WERE PHYSICALLY ABUSED BY THEIR IN INTIMATE PARTNER. ONE WOMEN'S ORGANIZATION WHO OFFERS COUNSELING AND SUPPORT IN WOMEN'S PRISONS IN CALIFORNIA WROTE. THE VAST MAJORITY OF AND CARSHARE INCARCERATED WOMEN WE WORK WITH WHO WERE SENTENCED UNDER THE FELONY MURDER RULE INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE AND WORK CRIMINALIZE FOR SURVIVAL ACTS. THESE WOMEN ARE NOT MURDERERS. S. B. FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN ENSURES THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO PUNISH THOSE WHO SHOULD BE PUNISHED. BUT WITH A PUNISHMENT THAT IS SCALED TO THE LEVEL OF THE PERSON'S INVOLVEMENT IN THE CRIME. IT ALLOWS US TO DISTINGUISH THOSE WHO ACTUALLY KILLED FROM THOSE WHO DID NOT. AN IMPORTANT JUST AN APPROPRIATE DISTINCTION. THANK YOU AND I URGE YOUR VOTE ON SP. FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN THING WAS RUBIO MISTER BONTA. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES WITH S. B. FOURTEENTH THAT. THIRTY SEVEN CALIFORNIA ONCE AGAIN HAS THE CHANCE TO MAKE AN IMPORTANT. AND NEEDED REFORM TO OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM WITH SP FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN AN INDIVIDUAL MAY ONLY BE CONVICTED. OF MURDER SIR CERTAINLY A SERIOUS AND HORRIBLE CRIME. IF THE INDIVIDUAL [inaudible] I'M. OLD WILLINGLY PARTICIPATED IN AN ACT THAT RESULTS IN A HOMICIDE OR AN ACT THAT CLEARLY WITH INTENDED TO RESULT IN A HOMICIDE. AND THE PURPOSE OF OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM IS TO HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE. FOR THE SPECIFIC CRIMES THEY HAVE COMMITTED. IN A FAIR AND LEGAL PROCEEDING BUT WITH EXISTING LAW THE FELONY MURDER MURDER RULE. THAT IS NOT ALWAYS THE CASE UNFORTUNATELY UNDER THE FELONY MURDER RULE A PERSON CAN BE CHARGED WITH THE MOST SERIOUS CRIME IN OUR PENAL CODE. EVEN KNOW THEY INDISPUTABLY NEVER COMMITTED THAT CRIME. THAT IS WRONG WE CAN CHANGE THAT TODAY. THE TIME HAS COME. I WANT TO THANK SENATOR SKINNER AND ANDERSON FOR OFFERING THIS BILL FOR ALL THE HARD WORK IN FIGHTING FOR THIS MUCH NEEDED CHANGE. RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. YOUR COOPER YOUR RECOGNIZE THAT MISTER SPEAKER THIS BILL IS RETROACTIVE APPLYING TO THOSE WHO ARE TO BE CONVICTED OF MURDER. QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR. UNDER THIS BILL THAT OBJECTION THANK YOU UNDER THIS BILL WILL WITH SOMEONE WHO IS SERVING TIME FOR MURDER. HAVE TO SHOW IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR RECENT THING. AND ALSO WHAT WILL THE BURDEN OF PROOF BE. THE PROSECUTION EVERY SENSE AND OSTERMAN ANY MAY TAKE THAT NOW OR YOUR CLOTHES. I DO TO MY CLOTHES. MR MEDINA WILL ADDRESS THAT QUESTION IN HIS CLOTHES MISTER COOPER OKAY THE CONVICTED MURDERER ONLY IT'S A SHOW THAT HE IS. THAT HE WAS CHARGED AND CONVICTED OF MURDER. BOTH NOT THE ACTUAL KILLER MAJOR PARTICIPANT. ME MAKE IT CLEAR. THIS BILL DOES NOT ADDRESS THE STANDARD OF BURDEN OF PROOF. FOR THE RECENT THING A CONVICTED MURDERER BEYOND THAT. IT ONLY REQUIRES A PERSON BE DECLARED THEIR NOT THE ACTUAL KILLER. OR A MAJOR PARTICIPANT. IS ON THE PROSECUTION TO PROVE OTHERWISE AND WITH LESSONS RETRY THE CASE. THIS WILL BECOME PUBLIC MATIC UNDER ME SCENARIOS ESPECIALLY TROUBLING IN CASE THERE WAS A CONVICTED MURDERER. JODI PLED GUILTY. IN THOSE PLEA BARGAINS THERE'S NO RECORD OF TESTIMONY TO TRIAL TRANSCRIPT REVIEW SOURCES A PLEA BARGAIN. IN THIS CASE IS WE DON'T HAVE THE EVIDENCE. THE END RESULT WOULD BE THAT THOSE WHO PLED GUILTY AND ATTORNEY SERVING TIME FOR MURDER WILL BE RELEASED. THE LOW ESTIMATE MOST CONVICT FOR MURDER THEN MINIMALIST SIX IN A PERSON'S. NOW NUMBER COMES FROM THE PROPONENTS OF THE BILL. THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S ASSOCIATION WITH NUMBER TO BE MUCH HIGHER. BOTTOM LINE WITH HIS BILL DOES IS RESULTS CONVICTED MURDER IN MANY CASES WITH NO DOCUMENTATION. EVERY TRIAL TRANSCRIPT EVERY TRIAL EVIDENCE TO REFUTE CONVICTED MURDERERS AND TEN DURING THE CRIME. BUT LET'S BE HONEST HERE ON THIS. THIS IS HIGH RISK BEHAVIOR IN STOCKTON THE MYSTICAL THING MURDER. DRIVER DRIES UP DROPS THREE GUYS OFF THE GOING THE BANK WITH GUNS TO ROB A BANK AS HIGH RISK BEHAVIOR THE DRIVER NEVER WHEN IT. OKAY PLEASE DROP THEM OFF TO GO ROB A BANK. SHE GOT KILLED INTO BAD GUYS WERE KILLED THAT'S THE BIG ISSUE THINK ABOUT THAT LOVE MARIJUANA RIPOFF YOU'RE GOING WITH GUNS SO A LOT OF THESE THINGS HAPPEN DURING HIGH RISK BEHAVIORS. AND THE WOMEN THEIR VICTIM OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ABSOLUTELY BUT A LOT OF THESE CASE IF THEY KNEW THEIR BOYFRIENDS CARRY GUNS. I'M A RECIPROCAL LIKE THAT BEFORE AND DONE THIS IN BOTH TO BE FOR FELONY MURDER IT HAPPENS A LOT SO RARELY SOMEONE KNOW HEY I KNOW I DID THIS IS GOING ON THEY SEE IT IS TO THE GUN THEY KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON IN THIS CRAZY RIGHT NOW. RECENT HUNDRED LIFERS A MONTH THING IN CALIFORNIA. S. CCR HER LIFE WAS A MONTH. AB ONE ONLINE PROP FORTY SEVEN PART FIFTY SEVEN PROP FIFTY FOUR LIKE EARLIER SOME WITH EARLIER WILL TALK ABOUT VICTIMS. WE NEVER TALK ABOUT VICTIMS EVER EVER. LOOKING WHICH CRAFTING WELL THERE'S BEEN EIGHTY FOUR BILLS IN TWO YEARS BUT WHAT 60% PASSED REALLY. WHAT THE COME DOWN? TO THIS IS OF RULE FOR A REASON TO AFFIX IT LET'S FIX IT RIGHT AND DO IT RIGHT. BUT FOR THAT TO HAPPEN THE DRIVER JUST TO GO THROUGH AND GET. A ROBBERY CONVICTION. IT IT COMES OUT IN. ACCOUNTABILITY THERE'S NO ACCOUNTABILITY RIGHT NOW. BUT YOU'RE TAKING SOMEONE TO COMMIT A CRIME LIKE THAT TYPICALLY. MUSCLES CLIENTS KNOW SOMEONE NEW HEY I KNOW WE CARE TONIGHT NUCLEAR TO GUN. WE DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA. THOSE ARE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN FANTASIZE ALL DAY. I NEED YOUR REST AYE PRICKLE PROSECUTE CASES I WORK GAINES ALBERTA HOMICIDE. SO THIS IS ACCURATE. BUT YOU CAN JUST TALK ABOUT ALL DAY BUT AT WHAT POINT DOES THE VICTIM MAKE A DIFFERENCE WILL PUT IS A VICTIM EVER MATTER. THAT'S BY THE MOST FRUSTRATING PART THE FAMILIES WHAT ABOUT THEIR FAMILIES. THE PERSON SUSPECT HE GETS TO GO HOME WITH HIM CAN WRITE TO ME CO INCOME VISIT THEM PUT MONEY AS BOOKS. WHAT IF THE VICTIM? THEN OF GRACE. ALSO AT SOME POINT WE KNOW WE GOT A FIX ALL THIS NOT TELL YOU WHAT. TO COME HOME TO ROOST. THAT'S WHAT YOU INITIATIVE IN. TWENTY TWENTY ON CRIME STUFF. IF PEOPLE ARE FED UP. YEAH NOT THAT'S THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE WHO REPRESENT REPRESENT EVERYBODY THE VICTIMS ALSO. BUT YOU NEVER HEAR THE VICTIMS IN HERE. AND LOOK A SENTIMENTAL CALL THE WANT BUT WHEN YOU'RE IN THERE YOU CAN A DEAD BODY. AND I DID THAT FOR MANY MANY YEARS. LOT OF DEAD BODIES OUT OF VICTIMS OF VIOLENT CRIME. THE DESERVE TO DIE. YOU HOPE PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING. THIS REALLY MAKES NO SENSE. KNOW HOW FAR WE GONNA GO. WHAT IS YOUR FAMILY MEMBER LAYING THERE DEAD? I DIDN'T KNOW I DIDN'T KNOW. I CAN TELL YOU COMEY ENTERS I SAT IN ON HOMICIDE SUSPECTS. ACCOMPLICES THAT NEW WHEN YOU REALLY DIG DOWN DEEP AND ASK THE RIGHT QUESTION TO THE RIGHT IF YOU. THEY KNEW THAT PERSON. WHAT'S THE BIG THAT BEHAVIOR. THIRTY SECOND ONE SHOULDN'T JUSTIFY THIS. IF YOU WERE FIX THINGS FIX THINGS RIGHT DON'T GEMMA THROUGH THE DAMP THROUGH BILL WITH JEFF THROUGH A BUNCH OF THINGS FIX A RIGHT HAVE A CONVERSATION. THAT GETS IT DONE IF YOU WANT TO GET DONE THERE'S NO HURRY. HERE WE ARE YOU KNOW TWO DAYS LEFT SESSION THREE IS WHATEVER IT IS AND WORKING ON THIS. THEIR TIME TO WORK ON THIS AND DO IT RIGHT THIS IS DOING THE WRONG WAY OUR SPEC YOUR JOURNAL VOTE ON THIS BILL. MISTER MURATSUCHI YOUR RECKLESS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AYE AYE. SPEC FULLY RISE IN OPPOSITION. TO S. B. FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN AND LET ME TELL LET ME TELL YOU WHY. I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE READ. AND IF THE COMMITTEE ANALYSES ON THIS BILL [inaudible] BUT YOU'RE CLEARLY I THINK WE ALL RECOGNIZE THAT THE FELONY MURDER. RULE NEEDS. TO BE REFORM IT NEEDS TO BE CHANGED WE'VE HEARD SEVERAL ANECDOTAL EXAMPLES. OF HOW. PEOPLE THAT HAD MINIMAL INVOLVEMENT OR NO SHOWING OF INTENT A COMMITMENT OR ANY IN ANY OF THE SERIOUS CRIME. WOULD -- BE CONVICTED OF MURDER UNDER THE FELONY MURDER RULE. BUT THIS BILL. IT'S NOT THE RIGHT SOLUTION. WE NEED TO WORK ON GETTING THIS RIGHT BECAUSE THIS IS GOING TO LEAD. TO THE RELIEF. OUR OF OF PEOPLE ON THIS IS GOING TO LEAD. TO A FURTHER PAIN AND SUFFERING OF CRIME VICTIMS THERE'S A REASON WHY THE CRIME VICTIMS UNITED IN CALIFORNIA -- POSTED THIS IF YOU READ. THE ASSEMBLY PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. IT TALKS ABOUT HOW THIS BILL PROVIDES NO EXCEPTION TO ALLOW FOR A TRIAL TRANSCRIPT TO BE USED IN A RE SENTENCING HEARING SO THAT'S GOING TO BE. TO REQUIRE THE CALLING OF ALL VICTIMS ALL WITNESSES OFF FAMILY MEMBERS WHO HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THE ORIGINAL CASE. TO TESTIFY ONCE AGAIN TO REOPEN THE PAIN AND SUFFERING THAT THEY WENT THROUGH THROUGH THE ORIGINAL CASE [inaudible] NEXT. THE BILL TALKS ABOUT THEIR ANNOUNCES TALKS ABOUT HOW. IN CASES THAT RESULT THROUGH A NEGOTIATED PLEA WHICH IS THE VAST MAJORITY OF ALL FELONY CASES. NO SUCH RECORD EXISTS. IN TERMS OF TRANSCRIPTS EGGS. COR A COURT RECORD TO RELY ON IN SO VIRTUALLY ALL PARTICIPANTS. AND THESE FELONY MET RUMORS WOULD QUALIFY FOR RELIEF TO WHICH THEY MAY NOT BE ENTITLED. AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST. THIS BILL IS PLACING THE BURDEN ON THE PROSECUTION TO PROVE BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT. THE PETITIONERS DO NOT QUALIFY HER RE SENTENCING SO IN OTHER WORDS THE PRESUMPTION IS WITH. THOSE. CONVICTED OF FELONY MURDER TO BE RE SENTENCED. THIS IS NOT THE RIGHT SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM OF FELONY MURDER IS THIS WILL REALLY THIS WILL LEAD TO THE RELEASE [inaudible] OF THOSE WE SHOULD NOT BE RELEASED THIS THIS WILL. THIS WELL THIS GOES TOO FAR. IT REOPENS IT REQUIRES CRIME VICTIMS TO HAVE TO RE OPEN THE PAIN. OF HAVING TO COME BACK TO COURT TO TESTIFY ONCE AGAIN TO JUSTIFY. WHY THEY FEEL THAT? THE PERSON SHOULD BE BEHIND BARS [inaudible] I ASK. THAT WE DO THIS RIGHT. AND WE REJECT THIS BILL. MISS GONZALEZ FLETCHER YOU'RE RECOGNIZED I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS CRITICAL BILL [inaudible] BECAUSE VICTIMS DO MATTER IN VICTIMS. SHOULD FEEL GOOD WHEN WE PUT AWAY THEIR ACTUAL KILLERS BUT NOBODY. PINES PIECE TO PUT AWAY. OTHERWISE [inaudible] LESS CULPABLE [inaudible] INDIVIDUALS. WHEN SOMEBODY IS KILLED? AND THAT HAS HAPPENED AGAIN. AND AGAIN AND AGAIN. I VENTURE TO SAY ANY OF US. WHO WENT TO LAW SCHOOL WHEN WE FIRST? STARTED CRIMINAL LAW AND LEARNED ABOUT THE FILM THE RULE FILLING MURDER ALL. WE'RE EXPOSED HOW ARCHAIC. IN I'M JUST IT COULD BE. I KNOW BECAUSE THE CASE LAWS THAT WE SAW WERE ALWAYS. PLEXI WE HAD A LOOK AT HOW PERPLEXING IT WAS TO GET THROUGH THE IDEA THAT CALIFORNIA. ACTUALLY HAS THIS. AND SIMILAR THINGS BROUGHT UP ON THIS FLOOR. OUR LITTLE I THINK OUTDATED IN THE ANALYSIS BECAUSE I KNOW. THAT THE AMENDMENTS TAKEN. IN THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. ALLOWS THE DA'S A COURT TO USE ALL MATERIALS AND ALL EVIDENCE IN THE RE SENTENCING CASE. THE BURDEN IS ON THE PETITIONER. TO A ALLOW FOR A CASE TO MOVE FORWARD. OF COURSE WE'VE EXEMPTED ALL CASES A DEAL WITH A COP KILLER. SO THERE WERE AMENDMENTS TAKEN TO SOME OF THE CONCERNS. AND I UNDERSTAND THAT -- THERE MIGHT BE CONCERNS BECAUSE THIS IS A PERFECT. I CAN'T EVER EXPECT SOMETHING THAT'S PERFECT BUT I CAN TELL YOU. AND IF IF ANYONE HERE HAS HAS SPOKEN TO SOME OF THE FOLKS TO AREN'T PERFECT HAVE MADE SOME MISTAKES IN THEIR LIVES. WHAT WOULD HAVE NEVER KILLED SOMEBODY? WOULD HAVE NEVER PARTICIPATED IN SOMETHING THAT RESULTED IN A DEATH. IN GETS OUR SPENDING THE REST OF THEIR LIVES IN JAIL. BECAUSE OF WHAT SOMEBODY ELSE DID. WE TALKED EARLY ON THIS FLOOR ABOUT MAKING ISTAKES WHEN WE WERE YOUNGER MAKING MISTAKES THROUGHOUT OUR LIVES. IT'S AMAZING TO ME BECAUSE SOME OF US ON THE SWERVE MADE MISTAKES AS ADULTS. BEEN ARRESTED AS ADULTS. THEIR MISTAKES THAT ARE MADE. IT SHOULD NOT RESULT IN AN INDIVIDUAL SPENDING THE REST OF THEIR LIFE IN PRISON FOR MURDER THEY DID NOT COMMIT. WOULD NOT COMMIT. HAD NO INTENTION OF BEING COMMITTED AND DID NOT PARTICIPATE IN HELPING IT COMMITTED. EXCEPT BEING THERE. DRIVING A CAR. BEING WITH A LOVED. ONE A BOYFRIEND OR HUSBAND OFTEN. THIS IS ABOUT JUSTICE. FOR THE ACTUAL VICTIM BECAUSE THE ACTUAL PERPETRATOR SHOULD BE THE ONE SPENDING THE REST THEIR LIVES IN JAIL. INTO OFTEN WE'VE HEARD STORIES ABOUT THE PERSON WHO IS ACTUALLY. SHOOTING THE GUN OR CAUSING THE MURDER MAKING A PLEA DEAL. AND THE PERSON WHO. MIGHT HAVE MADE SOME MISTAKES IN SHOULD SPEND TIME IN JAIL FOR THEIR MISTAKES. SPEND REST OF THEIR LIFE IN PRISON FOR THE ACTUAL MURDER. IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE IT'S NOT JUSTICE IN THE SHOULD BE FIXED I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MY VOTE. NAME IS GONZALEZ FLETCHER ALL DEBATE. AND DISCUSSION HAVING CEASED. MR MEDINA YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. THANK MY COLLEAGUES FOR THE DISCUSSION. TO ANSWER MY COLLEAGUE FROM SACRAMENTO. THE BURDEN OF PROOF IS INITIALLY ON THE PETITIONER. SHOW THAT THEY CAN MAKE THE CASE THAT THEY DID NOT KILL. TEND TO KILL. OR ACT RECKLESSLY IN THE CRIME THAT THEY WERE CONVICTED OF AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL MAKES CLEAR. THAT THE PETITIONER PASSED TO SET. FOR A VALID ARGUMENT UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY.
