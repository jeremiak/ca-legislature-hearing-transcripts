MEETING TO ORDER. WE DO NOT HAVE A QUORUM THAT WE WILL PROCEED AS SUBCOMMITTEE. SARAH Y. CASKET [inaudible] ASSEMBLYMEMBER MERITS. CG ARE THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL S. P. SIXTY FOUR IS TO ENSURE CALIFORNIA'S INCREASE PENETRATION OF RENEWABLE ENERGY AYE DOES NOT LEAD TO UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF INCREASED AIR POLLUTION. COMMUNITIES CALIFORNIA ALREADY BURKE BREATHED SOME OF THE UNHEALTHY ASTAIRE AND NATION THIS PROTECTION WILL HELP ENSURE THAT THE AIR QUALITY DOES NOT GET ANY WORSE. SO HERE'S THE PROBLEM WE HAVE OUR POOR AIR QUALITY CALIFORNIA HAS SOME OF THE MOST POLLUTED AIR IN THE COUNTRY COMMUNITIES IN AREAS THROUGHOUT THE NORTH THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. EXPERIENCE MANY DAYS WHEN AIR QUALITY THIS NOT MEET -- PROTECTIVE STANDARDS. THE OPERATION OF ONE POWER PLANT CAN SIGNIFICANTLY IN. PACKED THE QUALITY OF THE AIR ENOUGH IN ANY LOCALITY EACH TURN OF POLLUTION CONCRETE AT FIRST. CONSEQUENCES IN MANY AREAS THROUGHOUT THE STATE NOT MEETING PROTECTIVE AIR QUALITY STANDARDS AND MODELING SHOWS THAT THE SINGLE POWER PLANT CAN NEARLY DOUBLE THE CONCENTRATIONS OF POLLUTANTS. ARM FROM BACKGROUND LEVELS SO CHANGING OPERATIONS THE POWER PLANTS IS LIKELY TO MAKE YOUR CALL THE WORSE IF IF WE DON'T CONSIDER AND MAKE CERTAIN CONSIDERATIONS. LIKE HILL POWER PLANTS ARE LIKELY TO BE CYCLE MORE OFTEN MANY THE STATE'S NATURAL GAS POWER PLANTS ARE CONSTRUCTED TO PROVIDE BASED POWER OR POWER ONLY DURING RARE PEAK NEEDS. THIS IS CHANGING AS CALIFORNIA BRINGS MORE RENEWABLE ENERGY AND TO THE THE GREAT ESPECIALLY SOLAR ENERGY NATURAL GAS UNITS ARE INCREASINGLY BEING RAMP DOWN OR TURNED OFF IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY. THEN RAMP BACK UP OR A A TERM PACKED ON TO MEET IN A EVENING ELECTRICITY. CYCLING PRODUCES MORE EMISSIONS. SO CYCLING NATURAL GAS PLANTS BY STARTING STOPPING AN OPERATING AT PARTIAL LOADS PRODUCES SIGNIFICANTLY MORE AIR POLLUTION THAN FACILITIES OPERATING IT BASELITZ. POLLUTION MAY INCREASE IF THIS IS NOT ADDRESS SO THIS INCREASE IN THE CYCLING HAS ALREADY STARTED CURRENT STUDY SUGGESTS THAT THIS ISSUE -- WILL ONLY BECOME MORE ACUTE THOSE STUDIES CONDUCTED BY THE ART OF PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION AND IN THE INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANNING A PROCEEDING IN BY THE THE CAL ISIS SUGGESTED IN THE CERTAIN SCENARIOS. KNOCKS POLLUTION ASSOCIATED WITH NATURAL GAS GENERATION GAS GENERATION OF BOTH IN PARTICULAR COMMUNITIES IN IN THE STATE IS A WHOLE WILL INCREASE AS STATE MEET SAYS -- NATURAL GAS OUT REQUIREMENTS AND INCREASE RENEWABLE REQUIREMENTS SO THIS BILL REQUIRES A ACCESSIBLE DATA RELATED TO POWER PLANTS A OPERATION. IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE INCREASED DATA AVAILABILITY AND ACCESSIBILITY RELATED TO POWER PLANT OPERATIONS INCREASING TRANSPARENCY AND DATA USABLE DATA THAT'S A RELATED TO HELP POWER PLANTS ARE OPERATING FULLER DISTRICT CEDAR CHANGING OPERATIONS AND PERMITS THE BILL OF NEXT REQUIRED TO THEIR DISTRICTS ANALYZE HOW POWER PLANTS ARE ACTUALLY OPERATING AND LIKELY TO OPERATE IN THE FUTURE CHEN SURE. AT THAT PROTECTIONS ARE INCLUDED IN APPLICABLE PERMITS MANY THESE PERMITS ARE. YEARS OLD AND THEY WERE THERE'S AN ASSUMPTION THAT THE COULD BE OPERATING ALL THE TIME AND FINALLY IT REQUIRES A STUDY ON HEALTH. HOW TO PHASE OUT NATURAL GAS PLANTS YOU KNOW THE BILL REQUIRES A STEADY AND HOW TO PRIORITIZE TO REDUCTION OF THE USAGE AND EVENTUAL RETIREMENT OF NATURAL GAS? OF FACILITIES MOST IMPACTING THE AIR QUALITY OF DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES ARE BREATHING AND HEALTHIER. NOW THE OPPOSITION HAS FOCUSED ON TWO PRIMARY ARGUMENTS FIRST THE POWER PLANT EMISSIONS ARE SMALL WITH ANOTHER SECTORS AND SHOULD NOT BE THE FOCUS. INTO THAT THIS BILL IMPACTS RELIABILITY A CONTRARY. I'M ONE POWER ONCE POWER PLANTS EMISSIONS CAN SIGNIFICANTLY. SIMPLIFICATION THE IMPACT LOCAL AIR QUALITY ANY SUGGESTION THAT MINIMIZING POWER PLANT EMISSIONS SHOULD NOT BE PRIORITIZE A CALL. IGNORES THE YEAR IMPACTS ON COMMUNITIES THAT LIVE NEXT TO IN THE ARE NATURAL. GAS POWER PLANTS FOR EXAMPLE IN ITS ANALYSIS OF THE PICKUP APPEAL PEAK OF FACILITY THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION FOUND THAT EMISSIONS FROM THE PICO PEAK. PO PICO FACILITY COULD NEARLY DOUBLE OF THE ONE HOUR CONCENTRATION OF NIGHT AND THAT SHE KNOCKS IT RIGHT FROM. BACKGROUND LEVELS THE ANALYSIS ALSO FOUND THAT APPEAL PICO FACILITY COULD CONTRIBUTE TO THE AREAS NOT A TEAM IN A FEDERAL AIR QUALITY STANDARDS FOR BOTH FINE AND COARSE A PARTICULAR BOTTOM MATTER. CONTRARY TO THE OPPOSITION'S US STATEMENT THAT THIS BILL WILL HURT RELIABILITY BILL EXPLICITLY ENSURES THAT RELIABILITY IS PROTECTED. LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS HAVE THE AUTHORITY DURATION OF POWER PLANTS IN THE CURRENT LAW BUT THERE IS NOT A MECHANISM TO ENSURE THAT LOCAL RELIABILITY IS PROTECTED THIS BILL PROVIDES THAT PROTECTION. BY REQUIRING COMMUNICATION BETWEEN HERE DISTRICT AND THE BALANCING AT THIRTY AUTHORITY DAY AHEAD RESOURCES HAVE BEEN ESTIMATED TO PROVIDE 98% OF THE I. SO'S ENERGY NEEDS THIS BILL REQUIRES SENATOR DISTRICT NOTIFIED THE BALANCING AUTHORITY. AT LEAST TWENTY FOUR HOURS IN ADVANCE OF THE BAD AIR QUALITY DAY TO ENSURE THAT IT CAN MEET RELIABILITY REQUIREMENTS IN THE NEXT DAY MARK. WITH ME. A COUPLE OF EXPERTS THAT WILL. SHARE WITH YOU THEIR SUPPORT FOR THE BETTER. AND I URGE AND I'VE. BEFORE PROCEEDING FURTHER SENATOR -- YOU. AWAY EXCEPT THE AMENDMENTS AND OF THAT COMMITTEE AND THANK YOU FOR ACCEPTING MY AMENDMENTS YOU [inaudible] AND THANK YOU GOOD EVENING MY NAME IS SEAN ALLOWS ZERO I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ALLIANCE ONE OF THE SPONSORS OF THIS BILL SAT HOW THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ALLIANCE IS. A AND GROUP THAT FOCUSES ON ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE THROUGHOUT THE STATE WE HAVE MEMBERS FROM THE SAN DIEGO BORDER ON ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH COALITION. AND WE HAVE MEMBERS IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN THE BAY AREA ON THE CENTRAL COAST. AND AND WE HAVE WORKED ON AIR QUALITY AND ENERGY ISSUES FOR MANY YEARS ON AND WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL IT'S TRULY NECESSARY AT THIS TIME BECAUSE OUR COMMUNITIES ARE BREATHING SOME OF THE MOST UNHEALTHY. AIR IN THE ENTIRE NATION -- IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY CALIFORNIA HAS EIGHT OF THE TOP TEN WORST CITY. TO KILL A MATTER POLLUTION ON AND ONE SINGLE POWER PLANTS EMISSIONS CAN MAKE THAT POLLUTION NOTABLY WORSE. AND THE EXAMPLE THAT I WOULD OFFER -- TO THIS COMMITTEE AT THE CONCRETE EXAMPLE IS THAT PINOCHET ENERGY CENTER WHICH IS LOCATED IN THE TOP FIVE MOST DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY. I'M IN FRESNO COUNTY. AT THAT FACILITY I'M HAD SIGNIFICANT MODELING DONE NOT WHEN IT WAS FIRST PERMITTED BY THE AIR DISTRICT -- AND ABOUT MODELING SHOWED THAT IT WOULD -- RESULTS IN VIOLATIONS OF BOTH THE TWENTY FOUR HOUR PARTICULATE MATTER STANDARD AND THE ANNUAL STANDARD ON IT WOULD RESULT IN I EXCEEDED HIS OF OVER A OF A THE TWENTY FOUR HOUR STANDARD SO THE CONTENTION THAT POWER PLANTS ARE NOT A SIGNIFICANT PART OF THE PROBLEM AND IS BELIEVED BY THAT MODELING FOR THAT PARTICULAR PLANT THAT MODELING ONLY LOOKED AT STEADY STATE OPERATIONS IT DID NOT. LOOKED AT START UPS IN PARTICULAR AND THIS IS PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE PINOCHET IS IN FACT STARTING AND STOPPING NEARLY EVERYDAY. LAST YEAR EACH OF ITS FOUR UNITS STARTED OVER THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY TIMES. ONE OF THE UNITS OF THE PANACHE PLANT HAD AND KNOCKS RATE OF ONE HUNDRED AND ELEVEN POUNDS PER AND THE T. YOU. WHEN IT STARTS? BUT ITS STEADY STATE EMISSIONS ARE EIGHT POUNDS. PER AND BTO. GOOD I'M IN THIS MEANS I'M SORRY ETCETERA SO THE START UP EMISSIONS FOR THAT PARTICULAR PLANT ARE TEN TIMES MORE THAN THE STEADY STATE EMISSIONS. AND THIS IS REPLICATED IN OTHER PLANTS AROUND THE STATE BUT THE STATE'S WERE NOT GENERALLY PERMITTED AS AS TO REFLECT THOSE VARIATIONS IN OPERATION. SO TO ADDRESS THIS THE BILL PROPOSED TO DO THREE THINGS -- IT REQUIRES DATA AND TRANSPARENCY ABOUT HOW THESE PLANTS ARE OPERATING. SECOND IT REQUIRES THE AIR DISTRICTS TO LOOK AT THE IMPACT THAT THE PLANTS ARE HAVING AND TO CONDUCT ITS REGULAR -- ANNUAL PERMIT REVIEWS TO REFLECT THE IMPACTS THE PLANTS ARE HAVING AND TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE BOUNCING AUTHORITY IN DOING SO. AND THEN FINALLY IT REQUIRES THE STUDY THINK TANK. GOOD EVENING MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND OR WHISTLIN ON THE SENIOR MANAGER WITH THE UNION OF CONCERNED SCIENTISTS OUT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON GRID MANAGEMENT ISSUES IN CONTINUING TO DO RESEARCH UNDERSTAND WHAT OUR GREAT LOOKS LIKE IN THE FUTURE AS WE BRING ON MORE. RENEWABLE ENERGY AND MEET OUR CLIMATE TARGETS I'M GONNA CUT MY TESTIMONY IN HALF AT LEAST BECAUSE I THINK SENATOR WIECKOWSKI IN CHINA DID A REALLY COMPELLING JOB TALKING ABOUT WHAT THE BILL DAVID WHAT THE BILL. DOES IN THE PROBLEM IT'S TRYING TO ACHIEVE OUT TO SAY THAT NATURAL GAS CURRENTLY SUPPLIES ABOUT 40% OF OUR ELECTRICITY NEEDS AND WILL CONTINUE TO PLAY A ROLE HONOR SYSTEM. FOR SOMETIME AND I'M SAYING THIS BECAUSE I WANT TO UNDERSCORE THAT THE PURPOSE OF SB SIXTY FOUR IS NOT TO INDISCRIMINATELY SHUT DOWN NATURAL GAS. RATHER THE BILL IS INTENDED TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM WE'RE STARTING TO SEE HAPPEN AND WE THINK IT'S GOING TO GET A LOT WORSE OVER TIME AND THAT'S THE MUCH MORE FREQUENT INCREASE IN CYCLING OF THE GAS UNITS. AND THE POTENTIALLY NEGATIVE IMPACT THAT THIS CAN HAVE ON AIR QUALITY ESPECIALES IN AREAS THAT SIMPLY CANNOT AFFORD TO GET THEIR AIR ANY DIRTIER SO. LIKE CHINA SAID BEFORE THE PROBLEM IS THAT MANY OF THE STATE'S PLANTS WERE BUILT TO PROVIDE BASELOAD STEADY STATE POWER NOT EXPECTED TO BE TURNED ON AND OFF ON A DAILY BASIS. AND AS A RESULT THIS MORE FREQUENT CYCLING WAS NOT ANTICIPATED AND THEIR AIR PERMITS THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS TRYING TO ADDRESS. YOU KNOW CALIFORNIANS ARE ALREADY STARTING TO FEEL THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND COMMITTEES IN THE STATE READ SOME OF THE UNHEALTHY IS AIR IN THE COUNTRY. FOR THESE REASONS WE BELIEVE IT'S CRITICAL THAT THE STATE SHIFT TO CLEANER NON FOSSIL RESOURCES AT THE SAME TIME THE STATE DOES NEED BETTER TOOLS TO UNDERSTAND HOW CHANGING NATURAL GAS PLANT OPERATIONS. MAY IMPACT AIR QUALITY AN EXPLICIT MECHANISM FOR AIR DISTRICTS TO COORDINATE WITH GRID OPERATORS TO REDUCE THE DISPATCH OF NATURAL GAS PLANTS ON THE WORST AIR QUALITY DAYS. SB SIXTY FOUR WOULD ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA'S RAMP UP IN CLEAN GENERATION DOES NOT LEAD TO THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE OF FREQUENTLY CYCLING GAS POWER PLANTS. IN A WAY THAT INCREASES AIR POLLUTION. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS JOHN WHITE THE QUEEN PARA CAMP WE SUPPORT THE BILL. GOOD EVENING AND OF US GETS WITH. THE CALIFORNIA ARMS JUST ALLIANCE BUT ALSO WITH ASIAN PACIFIC ENVIRONMENTS AND I WORK AS WELL FOR LEADERSHIP COUNCIL FOR JUST ACCOUNTABILITY. IF YOU ARE CROWDED WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL ALSO HERE IN BEHALF OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE FUND IN THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF CONSERVATION VOTERS IN SUPPORT THINK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH BEFORE GOING FURTHER LIKE -- TO ESTABLISHED QUORUM AND SECONDLY ON THE RIGHT. MEMBERS ROUTE TO TRIGGER RUPTURED HERE ACOSTA HERE ACOSTA HERE CHAU. EGGMAN. EGGMAN HERE FLORA. FLORA HERE IN LIMON [inaudible] MCCARTY. MCCARTY HERE MELENDEZ BELINDA'S HERE RAYOS [inaudible] STONE. THANK YOU HAVE A QUORUM -- I WOULD LIKE TO NOW INVITE UP. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL GOOD EVENING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS LEO SO REFORM WITH THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. I CHAMBER OPPOSES SB SIXTY FOUR BECAUSE IT GRANTS UNFETTERED AUTHORITY TO LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS TO LIMIT THE OPERATION OF ENERGY FACILITIES NEEDED TO MEET PEAK ELECTRICITY DEMAND. AND ON TOP OF THAT CREATES A CUMBERSOME PROCESS THAT STOOD I PUT IT IN SOMETIMES CONTRARY TO EXISTING LAW AND REGULATIONS. ALSO THREATENS CALIFORNIA JOBS BY FORCING ENERGY PROVIDERS TO GO OUTSIDE OF THE STATE TO ME POTENTIAL ENERGY DEMANDS. THE PROPOSED THE BILL POINT TO A FEAR THAT STARTUP SHUTDOWNS AND CYCLING ARE NOT CONSIDERED AN ORIGINAL AIR QUALITY PERMITS AS MY COLLEAGUE MISTER SMARTY JONES AND AS THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS POINTEDOUT. MANY AGING GAS FIRED POWER PLANTS HAVE ALREADY BEEN REPLACED RETIRED A REPOWERED ALSO SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN TECHNOLOGY HAVE INCREASED EFFICIENCIES OVER THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS AND GAS FIRED POWER PLANTS. SUPPORTERS SUGGEST THAT THESE START UP SHUT DOWN CYCLING'S MAY ACCOUNT FOR THE MAJORITY OF INCREASED EMISSIONS FROM THIS FACILITY HOWEVER THE BILL GOES ON TO ORDER MORE SHUT DOWN STARTUP DEPENDING ON NON ATTAINMENT AREAS. AND DOES SO WHETHER WHETHER OR NOT THAT FACILITIES IT OPERATING WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF ITS PERMITS. THE BILL TWENTY FOUR HOUR NOTICE REQUIREMENTS ARE UNWORKABLE IN OUR OPINION. ENERGY FACILITIES DO NOT HAVE AN ON OFF SWITCH IN MOSCOW THURS THROUGH CERTAIN STEPS TO SHUT DOWN SAFELY ALTHOUGH THE BILL DOES CONTAIN AN EXCEPTION WE RECOGNIZE THAT FOR CONTINUE GENERATION DURING PEAK DEMAND. TIME WHEN ALSO DOESN'T RECOGNIZE. A COMPLEX ENERGY GRID DECISIONS WHICH ARE MADE INCREASINGLY SHORT INCREMENTS OF TIME HOURS OR EVEN MINUTES THESE DAYS. AS THE COMMITTEE ANNOUNCES RIGHTLY POINTS OUT THERE MANY LAWS IN PLACE ALREADY REGULATED VERY IMPACTS OUGHT TO BE ADDRESSED BY THAT BILL. FOR EXAMPLE THE BILL SEEKS TO LIMIT LOCAL AIR EMISSIONS THROUGH YET ANOTHER PERMIT PROCESS BUT THE AIRPORT AUTHORITY REQUIRED TO CONTROL EMISSIONS AND COORDINATE WITH LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS TO LIMIT STATIONARY SOURCE EMISSIONS SOUGHT TO BE CONTROLLED BY THIS BILL. THE BILL ALSO SEEKS TO TAKE IT ACTION DURING NON ATTAINMENT DAVIS BUT THE AIRPORT IS ALREADY REQUIRED TO PREPARE DETAILED SATED WITH IMPLEMENTATION PLANS ON HOW TO ACHIEVE ATTAINMENT. BOTH THROUGH THE SET AND NOW UNDER AB SIX SEVENTEEN ACTED JUST LAST YEAR WHICH REQUIRES A LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS TWO HOLISTICALLY EXAMINE LOCAL AIR QUALITY ISSUES IN THE COMMUNITY. THE BILL ALSO SEEKS TO LIMIT THE OPERATION OF FOSSIL FUEL GENERATING UNITS SEEMINGLY IS A MEANS TO ENCOURAGE ADDITIONAL RENEWABLE PROCUREMENT. THE GENERATORS ARE RT A MANDATED TO UNDERGO A COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS AND SUBMITTED DETAILED PROCUREMENT PLAN. WITH THE ALREADY LEGISLATOR REQUIREMENTS TO INCORPORATE RENEWABLES ENERGY SOURCES AND MINIMIZE YOUR LOCAL AIR POLLUTION. FINALLY AB ELEVEN THIRTY TWO ENACTED LAST YEAR ALREADY ALLOWS THE AIRPORTS ISSUED ABATEMENT ORDER WHEN AIR POLLUTANTS CONSTITUTE AN IMMINENT AND SUBSTANTIAL ENDANGERMENT FROM A FACILITY. ENSURING THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES ARE NOT DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BY OUR ENERGY POLICY IS A LAUDABLE GOAL. HOWEVER WE BELIEVE THAT THE METHODS PROPOSED BY THIS BILL OR CONVERT CUMBERSOME FRAUGHT WITH LOGISTICAL PROBLEMS THAT DON'T WORK WITH IN THE README REALITY OF ENERGY RELIABILITY. AND DOES NOT ACTUALLY HAVE A HIGH LIKELIHOOD OF EXCEEDING ON THIS SCHOOL. FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST IN NOVA. THANK YOU I'M CHANCE BUT HE JONES WITH THE INDEPENDENT ENERGY PRODUCERS -- AND WE REPRESENT BOTH UTILITY SCALE RENEWABLE COULD A LOOK OF THE TODAY WE'RE HERE TO TALK ABOUT ARE GHASTLY AND THAT GASOLINE IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL TO KEEP THE LIGHTS ON INTO THAT MEET RELIABILITY NEEDS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND THERE SEEMS TO BE THIS FACTOID THAT SOME. ON ALL THE GAS PLAN. COMMUTER ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY GOALS -- IT IS NECESSARY IT IT REALLY ISN'T THE FACT THAT A MATTER IS -- INCLUDING THE S. B. THREE FIFTY STUDY WHICH WAS DONE AT THE BEHEST OF THE LEGISLATURE THE UP BEFORE THE I SO -- THE COMBINED CRITERIA POLLUTANTS ABOUT 21% -- OF THE OF THE LOAD AT YOU CAN BE ANOTHER WHICH IT THE GHASTLY IS OF THE COMBINED CRITERIA POLLUTANTS SO IT IS NOT A AT A THAT WHEN I SAY ITS NOT SIGNIFICANT FACTOR THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. THE THREE PARTS OF THIS BILL ONE PART A LET'S GET THAT OFF THE TABLE RIGHT AWAY THE DATA. THESE THESE PLANTS ARE CONTINUOUSLY MONITORED TWENTY FOUR SEVEN TO THE AIR DISTRICTS HAVE THAT DATA OKAY THE AYE AYE THE P. A PARTNER THE AIRBOARD -- THAT BASICALLY OF MONITORS THE CARBON OUTPUT OF THESE PLANTS SO THE ISSUES DATA AND PEOPLE WANNA PUT STUFF IN A IN A MORE USABLE FORM GREAT HAVE AT IT BECAUSE IT'S THERE -- IN IN THOSE PLANTS OPERATE WITHIN THEIR PERMITS -- VERY STRINGENT STANDARDS AND ALL THEY ARE DISTRICTS IN THE IN THE STATE VERY STRINGENT CO TWO STANDARDS. THEY COMPLY WITH ALL THOSE SO THAT'S THAT'S ISSUE ONE THAT THE SECOND ISSUE WE TOOK -- THE BILL DOES IN FACT THAT SECTION E. IN THIS BILL -- BASICALLY STRUCTURE SOMETHING THAT LOOKS LIKE AN A AND THIS IS MORE OF AN ENERGY COMMITTEE -- ISSUING MAYBE NOT HERE BUT IN ESSENCE PUTS THE AIR DISTRICTS IN IN IN IN THEIR ISSUANCE OF PERMITS WHICH POWER PLANTS OPERATE FIRST -- RATHER THAN LEAVING THAT TO THE BALLOT SHEET AUTHORITIES WHICH IS MORE APPROPRIATE -- SO THAT SECTION IS VERY PROBLEMATIC IT DOES HAVE SECTION F. I THINK ITSELF THAT ALLOWS THE BASIE BALANCING AUTHORITY TO BASICALLY OVERRIDE THAT INTO I AND THEY CAN HEAT WAVES WHEN WE ACTUALLY NEED TO BEAT THE AIR CONDITIONING LOAD WHICH HAS. OBVIOUSLY REAL HIGH HEALTH AND SAFETY ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH IT THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IS THE PLANT OPERATORS BUILT THE WAY THIS ACTUALLY WORKS THEY PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT'S IN THEIR PERMITS. SO DAVID POLL THEY ONLY HAVE ONE START DEBT DAY THAT'S ALL THEY'RE GOING TO DO SO IF IF THE EYES SO WHERE THE LADY OF THE P. OR BANK WHICH IS THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. ABILITY OF TORY PICKS UP THE PHONE AND SAYS WE NEED YOU TO RUN. THEY WILL OKAY IT'S THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO TRY TO GET IN BETWEEN THE BELGIAN AUTHORITIES AIR DISTRICT THEIR CRIMINAL -- AND CIVIL LIABILITIES FOR NOT LISTENING TO THE LOCAL AIRPORT SO THAT THAT'S THAT'S A PROBLEM AND SO IT IT EH AND TWO LAST POINTS ONE I'LL. ALSO POINT OUT IN THAT IN THIS IS SOMETHING THE COMMITTEE -- IF THEY WANT TO TAKE A BROADER VIEW ON THE HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE SECTION OF THE FINEST -- A DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. IN THIS BILL WAS DESIGNED FOR BASICALLY -- DISTRIBUTING CAT A CAP AND TRADE DOLLARS THAT'S WHAT IT'S FOR OF GAY AND THAT'S THAT'S FINE OF THOSE WITH THE DID LEGISLATURE DECIDED IT WANTED TO DO. BUT IT WASN'T DESIGNED TO PUT REGULATIONS AND ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES SO THAT THIS IS A SOMETHING YOU MAY WANT TO THINK ABOUT HOW THE THAT IT'S SORT OF AN EXPANSION. OF THAT OF THAT DEFINITION IS BEING USED IN AREAS WHICH I THINK GOT CREATE SOME LEGAL -- MAGNUSON AND MAY LEAD. TO FINALLY I THINK THERE'S ONE LAST ISSUE AND THAT IS -- YOU KNOW THESE POWER PLANTS -- HAVE BASICALLY BEEN BUILT LARGELY LAST ATTENDED FIFTEEN YEARS THEY DISPLACE THE OLDER EISENHOWER OUR AIR A GENERATION THAT WAS THERE. THEY'RE VERY EFFICIENT DE MITA MAY MAY HAVE MOST OF THE STANDARD CD -- TO AND YOU TELL IT BY BY PUTTING THESE POWER PLANTS IN THERE WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO ACTUALLY -- YOU KNOW SHUT DOWN PLANTS LIKE A HUNTERS POINT -- PORTRAYAL OF SOUTH BAY DOWN SCADA LOW PLANTS THAT CLEARLY HAD IMPACT ON ABOUT WHAT I THINK ALL OF US WOULD AGREE WERE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES BECAUSE WE'VE GOT POWER PLANTS THAT ARE OPERATE ELSEWHERE IN THE STATE MEAN ABLE TO MEET THOSE LOCAL. LOCAL -- NEED SO -- THAT LAST PART OF THIS BILL WHERE YOU DID THERE TRYING TO DECIDE WHO GETS TO RETIRE. WILL GIVEN THE FACT THAT THE STATE DOESN'T OWN THOSE RESOURCES IT IT IT IT IT GETS A LITTLE OUGHT YOU KNOW THAT BIG RAISES SOME BIG CONCERNS IN IN OUR MIND IN TERMS OF HOW THAT ACTUALLY GONNA WORK -- OTHER THAN THAT WE LIKE YOUR BILL SENATE SO [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU OF SIR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE MICHAEL SAW CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURED GOODS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION I THINK GIVE THE LATENESS OF THE HOUR I WILL JUST GO WITH THAT ECHO MY COLLEAGUES. ARE COMMENTS FROM THE CHAMBER -- AND OPPOSE S. B. SIX FOUR THANK YOU THANK YOU ANY FURTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. CHAIR AND MEMBERS GREAT COOK RIVERS IN THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA POWER AGENCY IN OPPOSITION. A MAN I APOLOGIZE FOR MISSING ATTORNEY TO GIVE SUPPORT A A MAN ON THE OFFICE HERE COULD CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS ALICE KESSLER BEHALF OF CALPINE CORPORATION IN OPPOSITION. JERRY MEMBERS ANTHONY SAMPSON ON BEHALF OF THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA PUBLIC POWER AUTHORITY IN OPPOSITION. PATRICK WELCH FOR THE CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL UTILITIES ASSOCIATION ALSO IN OPPOSITION. TURN MEMBERS BRUCE MIGNON ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA LARGE ENERGY CONSUMERS IN OPPOSITION FOR THE REASONS STATED. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS ILLITERACY FOR THE WESTERN STATES PETROLEUM ASSOCIATION ALSO NOT. MET CLUB SCENE ON BEHALF OF* BOAST. ISRAEL SALAS APOLOGIZE FOR GETTING A LETTER IN LATE WITH SAN DIEGO GAS AND ELECTRIC ALSO PUTS [inaudible] RIGHT. I UNDER FOR THE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION SAYING NONE. QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. MS MELENDEZ. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN SENATOR WIECKOWSKI SO NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN. SO IF I PLEDGE IT IS A PLEASURE SERVING WITH YOU IN THE ASSEMBLY OKAY SO. YOU HAVE A BILL THAT -- IT'S GOING TO REQUIRE THE LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS TO SHUT DOWN SOME OF THESE PLANTS AND I'M JUST KIND OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. HOW IS THAT DETERMINED? WELL ACTUALLY WON'T BE THE END. THE VISION IS IT WON'T BE THE AIR QUALITY DISTRICTS THAT WILL SHUT IT DOWN BILL. THEY WILL MAKE THE RECOMMENDED IT MAKE THE STATEMENT THAT IT'S A NON ATTAINMENT AIR DAY SO THAT THERE'S A DESIRABILITY WITH THE BALANCING AUTHORITY TEMPERING ONLINE. OTHER UNITS THAT ARE OUTSIDE THAT ATTAINMENT AREA SO THERE'S ALL THESE. NATURAL GAS PLANTS IN. JUST LET ME A JONES WAS CRACKED I'M NOT OPPOSED AND NOT THIS BILL IS NOT DESIGNED TO SHUT DOWN ALL THE NATURAL GAS PLANTS BECAUSE WE NEED THEM FOR THE RELIABILITY BUT IT SAID INFORMATION THAT YOU HAVE THAT. THIS IS A BAD DAY OR A BAD SERIES OF THE IN SAN JOAQUIN CAN WE TURN ON PLANTS [inaudible] IN. THE INLAND EMPIRE AND DO THAT BALANCING ACT DO THE THAT THAT DECISION HAVE THAT DATA ON HAND THAT THE HERE DISTRICTS WILL BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE. OKAY SO. YOU'RE SAYING YOU'RE IN YOUR INTENT IS NOT. TO SYSTEMATICALLY START SHUTTING DOWN THESE PLANTS BUT I'M JUST CURIOUS DO YOU HAVE A RESPONSE TO SOME OF THE CONCERNS. THAT HE BROUGHT UP SPECIFICALLY RIGHT I MEAN I WOULD SAY FOR THE THE SECOND SHOCK ABOUT SUBPARAGRAPH HE AND SUBPARAGRAPH HAVE I DO AGREE THAT THAT'S THE ENERGY AND UTILITIES. A A QUESTION. UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN THESE PLANTS WERE GRANTED THEIR PERMITS IT WAS FOR BASELOAD NOW WERE IN THIS DIFFERENT WORD ON A WORLD OF CYCLING THAT UP. STARTING IN AND AND GOING UP AND DOWN AND UP AND DOWN SO THERE'S A DIFFERENT [inaudible] POLLUTING -- CHARACTERISTIC THAT THE PLANTS HAVE THAT DOESN'T EXIST WHEN YOU JUST HAVE THE OLD DAYS WHEN YOU JUST RAN THAT THE NATURAL GAS -- FACILITIES ALL OF ONE'S OKAY SO THAT'S THAT'S GOING TO BE IF I'M LUCKY THAT'S NEXT WEEK. ON THE STUDY AND AND THAT THE PARTY THREE TO MISS THEM WON THE POT AND PART THREE IS YOU KNOW WHO GETS TO CHOOSE WILL THAT'S PART OF WHAT THE STUDY IS WE WANT TO WE WANT TO GET AS A INVENTORY AND AN ANALYSIS OF WHERE ARE THEY HOW. WHAT PLANTS ARE BEING USE WHAT WHAT THE -- THE PLANTS ARE BEING CYCLE MORE OFTEN WHAT'S THE USAGE OF WHAT'S THE KNOCKS AND SOCKS AND ALL THAT THAT THE POLLUTION SO IT'S COMING OUT OF IT. AND AGAIN THAT GETS BACK TO THE NUMBER ONE IS THIS DATA I MEAN IT'S REALLY UNUSABLE I MEAN THE DATA NOW THESE FOLKS HAVE TO DO A NEXT CELLS. SHE AND RENTED OUT THEN TRY TO MAKE CALCULATION SO WE DON'T REALLY KNOW WE'RE IF WE CAN. IMPROVE THE OPERATION I MEAN. I'D LIKE TO THINK THAT THE ISA WOULD SAY OH OKAY I GET IT WE KNOW THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE BAD HAIR DAYS AND IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND ERIC. AND AND IT'S WINDY IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA SO LET'S JUST FLIP AND THAT'S NOT THAT BIG OF A DEAL MAYBE MY EXPERTS HAVE A DIFFERENT. OR MORE CLARIFYING BUT I THINK THAT'S YOU KNOW I THINK YOU ANSWERED IT WELL ENOUGH -- I JUST -- I THINK YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THEIR CERTAINLY SOME CONCERNS WITH WHAT DIRECTION THIS BILL IS GOING IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE STILL -- MAYBE WE LOOKING AT SOME AMENDMENTS ARE NOW. WELL I MEAN I GUESS I'VE GOT TO GO TO ENERGY AND I'M I'M I'M MINDFUL OF THAT THAT THIS IS STEP ONE THAT THERE'S A STEP TO THIS IS FOR THE AIR QUALITY. AND KNOW THAT DATA A COLLECTION IN THE STUDY ARE. LET'S WORRISOME BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T YOU HAVE A FOCUS TO MISTER CHAIRMAN I WILL WRAP THIS UP I APOLOGIZE FOR TAKING ONE MORE TIME THAN NORMAL -- IT'S THERE IS A GREATER AMOUNT OF POLLUTION AND I THINK THE DATA BEARS THIS OUT OF COURSE YOU KNOW THERE'S THE GREATER AMOUNT OF POLLUTION RETIREMENTS COMING FROM AUTOMOBILES. NOT FROM THESE PLANTS. THE PLANTS WRECKED URBAN IT'S PRETTY SMALL. PERCENTAGE IN COMPARISON SO. RIGHT I THINK PART OF THIS IF IF IF I MAY MISTER CHAIR IS THAT IS THAT WE'RE HAVING DISCUSSIONS ABOUT HER REGIONAL GRIT. AND WHAT THIS IS GOING TO DO IS THIS IS GOING TO GIVE US SOME ARM. OF PRINCIPLES THAT CALIFORNIA STANDS FOR IN THE RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO BECAUSE NOT YOU KNOW I WOULD AGREE WITH THE OPPOSITION THAT CALIFORNIA SENATE REALLY GOOD CHANCE. GOOD JOB OF UPDATING THEIR THEIR AYE GAS FIRED PLANTS AND WE'VE GOT IS LIKE SOMEBODY'S GOT A BRAND NEW CARS RUNNING BETTER IN THE FIFTEEN YEAR OLD CAR BELIEVE WE'RE NOT GONNA. BUT THIS WILL GIVE US SOME TOOLS AND I WOULD APPLAUD THE CALIFORNIA AND NATURAL GAS PRODUCERSWHEN WE GET INTO DISCUSSIONS WITH OUR NEIGHBORS ABOUT A REGIONAL GRID. THESE ARE GONNA BE SOME BASELINE DISCUSSIONS THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE WHERE WHERE ARE GAS. FIRE PLANTER CLEAN IN YOUR GAS FIRED PLANTS IN IN BE A US A I GUESS WOULD BE CALLED THE BASELINE THAT I'D LIKE THAT. HAVE OUR STATE USE WE GET INTO THESE DISCUSSIONS ON RELIABILITY AND THE BENEFITS OF THE REGIONAL GREAT DISCUSSION. I THINK YOU. SENATOR. I'M I'M INTO MY CONCERNS MIGHT BE MORE FOR NEXT COMMITTEE WHERE I SIT ALSO. AND BUT I'M. I GUESS I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED ABOUT SO I HAVE TO THE PLANTS AND IN MY DISTRICT. YOU PLANT AND I ALSO THE ONE IN IN TRACY IS RIGHT. ALMOST RIGHT ALONGSIDE THE ALTIMA. WHERE PEOPLE ARE COMMUTING FOUR HOURS A DAY [inaudible] EVERYDAY. AND IT'S ALSO GOING TO BE. A HUNDRED AND SEVEN SWEET. SO WHAT IF YOU BEGIN USING AIR CONDITIONERS. SO IF WE'RE SAYING THAT IF THE PLANTS ARE NEEDED TO KEEP EVERYTHING OPERATING. THAT THEY CAN. BUT IF THE AIR QUALITY IS TOO BAD. THEY CAN'T LIST THEY NEED IT. THEN IT SEEMS LIKE WERE NOT YOU NOT DOING THAT MUCH. ON THE WORST DAYS YES ON THE ON THE ON THE ON HUNDRED AND SEVEN AND TRACY WHEN WHEN WE GOT EVERYBODY HAVE THEIR AIR CONDITIONING ON PROBABLY NOT. PROBABLY NOT IT BUT IT'S ALL THE IN BETWEEN STUFF. IT'S ALL THE IN BETWEEN STEP WERE NOT AT YOU KNOW AT A READY THAT. THE GREAT THREATEN READY TO POP AND THAT YOU CAN HAVE THIS INFORMATION ABOUT THE AIR QUALITY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IN IN THESE DIFFERENT REGIONS AND SAY WELL. YOU KNOW TWENTY FOUR FORTY EIGHT HOURS AHEAD YOU SEE THIS IS REALLY GOOD TO BE BAD AND STOCKTON AND WE WANT TO TURN ON THESE UNITS IN -- THE INLAND EMPIRE OR UP IN HUMBOLDT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO GET THAT POWER ON THAT THE RELIABILITY OF THE THE GRAD. MAN I JUST PICKING ON YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE THERE DISARRAY AS HE DOESN'T LIKE THIS BUT YOU KNOW I MEAN THAT'S THE THAT'S RIGHT THE IS THAT IS THAT WE GET. THESE MORE MICRO BY AIR QUALITY POCKETS THAT WE KNOW ABOUT TRYING. TO TO COOPERATE WITH THE WITH THE LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS AND THE BALANCING AUTHORITY AND GIVING THEM THE INFORMATION THEY MAKE THAT MANY OF THE COMPUTER SOUTH THEY'RE UNBELIEVABLE THAT THEY MAKE THESE DECISIONS ON THAT BALANCING IN THE DAY HAD MARKET IN THE FIFTEEN MINUTE MARKET. ON WHO NEEDS IT AND IS JUST ANOTHER LITTLE INGREDIENT THAT GOES IN ON WHAT'S THE AIR QUALITY THERE AND TRACY I AT AT THIS TIME ORG OR THE NEXT TWENTY FOUR HOURS THAT'S REALLY WHERE I WANT TO END UP. UP WITH THIS IS THAT IT BECOMES A A TOOL [inaudible] RIGHT BUT BUT AS WE WHO REPRESENTS THE VALLEY WE FREQUENTLY HAVE AIR QUALITY ITS THE NATURE OF THE VALLEY RIGHT. THE BAY AREA BY HAS THOSE BIG -- FANS A BLOW EVERYTHING AND ARE MY DISTRICT [inaudible] ON SO ALSO THOUGH BUT IT IN CREATING I MEAN SO SO THAT'S GOING TO BE GIVEN EVERYONE KNOWS THAT THAT THE AIR QUALITY IN THE VALLEY IS IS IS NOT A NOT GREAT AND THAT NOTHING THAT'S OKAY BUT THERE'S A LOT OF ERRORS. OTHER VARIABLES THAT IMPACT THAT SUCH AS AGRICULTURE SUCH AS CAR SUCH AS DIESEL SUCH AS EVERYTHING ELSE AND JUST AGAIN YOU'RE YOU'RE LIVING IN A BOWL. BUT BUT BUT I I HOPE WE'RE NOT SAYING SOMETHING LIKE BECAUSE WITH MY TWO PLANTS WAS A PEOPLE WHO ARE WHO ARE WORKING. AND EVEN THOUGH WE WANT GOOD AIR QUALITY WE ALSO WANT. THE JOBS REMAIN AND PEOPLE HAVE MADE A LOT OF INVESTMENTS IN THOSE PLANTS ARE MOST OF A MARK OVER FIFTEEN YEARS OLD AT THE HUGE AMOUNT INVESTMENTS PEOPLE ARE WORKING THEY'RE GETTING. GOOD PAYING GOOD JOBS AND WHAT DO WE DO IT TO THE MARKET AND WHAT WE DO THE INDUSTRY WHEN WE SAY NOW THINGS ARE GONNA HAVE TO START. ALRIGHT YOU'RE OFF YOUR ON YOUR OFF YOUR OWN AND WHAT DOES THAT DO [inaudible] THE OVERALL [inaudible] THE PEACE OF MIND EMPLOYMENT STABILITY ALTHOUGH RIGHT TO WEAR BETTER BUT WE DON'T WANT TO TRANSPORT OUR JOBS TO THE INLAND EMPIRE. PART OF THAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN MISHAP MISTER CHAIR YOU KNOW PART OF THAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN WHEN WE REACH OUR RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARDS MEAN WE'VE WE'VE ALREADY MADE THAT VOTE ON THE UTILITIES HAVING TO HAVE A BLEND OF MORE. AYE SOLAR AND RENEWABLE THAT'S THAT'S NOT GONNA CHANGE WITH WITH THAT. SB SIXTY FOUR S. B. SIXTY FOUR HAS THE WRINKLE IF I MAY OF GIVING US INFORMATION ABOUT THE AIR QUALITY IN ALL THESE DIFFERENT SUBSECTIONS BECAUSE IT MAY BE. NOT TURNING ON A CALPINE IN HAYWARD BECAUSE IT'S THE WIND IS BLOWING IN THIS COULD EXACERBATE STOCKTON AND TRACY VERSUS TURNING ON THE FACILITY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA OR OR MID STATE BECAUSE THAT MAKES SENSE IT'S JUST. IT'S IT'S STUDYING THOSE THOSE THINGS IN THE STUDY BUT AND THE DATA AND THEN JUST THAT COOPERATION. WITH THE LOCAL AIRPORTS IN THE CASE SO WHICH DOESN'T EXIST NOW. AIRPORTS HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION BUT YOU'RE SAYING THAT THEY HAVEN'T DONE MODELING STUDIES. ON AMID THEY HAVE THE INFORMATION ABOUT AIR QUALITY. RIGHT IT JUST ITCHES USABLE I GUESS IS THE IS IS SO THAT WE CAN WE CAN -- UNDERSTAND IT AND THIS IS AN ELEMENT THAT WE'D LIKE TO FOR THEM TO CONSIDER I'M NOT TRYING TO COMPROMISE RELIABILITY THAT'S THAT'S NOT. THAT'S NOT THE GOAL HERE IS JUST TO SAY IF THERE'S A CHANCE THAT YOU CAN TURN OFF INSTEAD OF USING THE TREES TO FACILITY YOU CAN USE. ONE AND ANOTHER PART OF AND STILL HAVE RELIABILITY AND YOU KNOW YOU KNOW BECAUSE WE KNOW WHEN WE HAVE THOSE. BAD HAIR DAYS HITS FOR SEVERAL DAYS IN A ROW IN ITS NICHE DECEMBER AND JANUARY AND THAT KNOCKS ON JUST STARTING UP ONE OF THESE I THINK IT'S AND THIS IS LIKE THIRTY EIGHT TIMES OF WHAT IT IS OR ITS EQUIVALENT OF THIRTY EIGHT HOURS. RUNNING IT AS A NORMAL WAY THAT WE WOULD RUN A GAS FIRED PLANT VERSUS TURNING UP TURNING IT OFF AND THAT'S THAT'S THE TRICK IS THE MANAGEMENT OF THESE ASSETS THAT WE HAVE BEEN PROVIDING US WITH ENERGY AS WE MOWER WE'VE D. CARBONIZED ARE. ARE RUN. ECONOMY TO EATEN US REQUESTS AND AND NO END OF PERHAPS YOU CAN'T ABOUT WHAT DOES THAT DO. FOR THE FOLKS WHO HAVE MADE ALL THIS INVESTMENT AND THE PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING THERE WE START CYCLING OFTEN ON A DIFFERENT. AND TRANSFERRING AROUND WHAT DOES THAT DO. TO THE INVESTMENTS ARE MADE TO THESE FACILITIES. THAT HAVE GONE ALONG THAT BETTER BUT A NEW GENERATION TO WHAT THE OLD FACILITIES WHERE. SO IF IF I MAY JUMP IN JUST A LITTLE BIT SO THAT YOU'RE BRINGING UP THE FACT THAT THERE'S A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY WITHIN WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE ELECTRICITY SYSTEM THINGS ARE MOVING VERY QUICKLY AND IT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE THAT THE CONTRIBUTION OF CRITERIA AIR POLLUTION. FROM THE GAS FLEET IS RELATIVELY LOW COMPARED TO MORE MOBILE SOURCE SAYS BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT THAT COULD CHANGE OVER TIME BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT THE PLANTS ARE CYCLING SO OFTEN. SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS JUST MAKE IT MORE POSSIBLE FOR THE AIR DISTRICTS TO DO ANALYSIS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND. HOW THE INCREASE IN CYCLING COULD BE IMPACTING AIR QUALITY IN THEIR BASINS ANYONE AND THE PART OF THE PUT THE LAST PART OF THE BILL THAT SAYS? THAT P. YOU SEEN THIS C. E. C. SHALL WORK TOGETHER TO DO A STUDY ON WHAT THE LONG TERM TURNED OUT OF GAS INEVITABLY INEVITABLY WILL LOOK LIKE IS IN PART TO PROVIDE SOME CERTAINTY TO THE MARKET. ABOUT WHERE WE'RE HEADED BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF DISCUSSION HAPPENING RIGHT NOW ABOUT. DO WE NEED THIS PLANT THE PLANT CAN OPERATE BASED ON WHAT IT'S GETTING PAID FOR RIGHT NOW SHE WE GIVE IT MORE MONIES THAT CAN AND DO RETROFITS TO CONTINUE RUNNING BECAUSE IT'S REALLY NECESSARY FOR RELIABILITY. IS OUR DIFFERENT ALTERNATIVE THERE'S A LOT OF HAPHAZARD DECISIONS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW AND THE STATE DOESN'T HAVE. A LONG TERM PLAN FOR THAT TURNED OUT OF GAS WHICH WE'VE COMMITTED TO THROW CLIMATE POLICIES. THAT MEANS THAT THE PLAN IS ONE THING BUT THEN WHEN WHEN YOU START TALKING ABOUT. HER THEN YOU CAN CHECK THIS ONE OFTEN TURN OVER THERE SO SO YOU'RE SAYING. THE THE THE FUTURE IS UNCERTAIN AND THIS IS ONE OF OUR OWN A AN ATTEMPT. AT EXPERIMENTATION OF THE FUTURE WHO KNOWS WHAT THE CURRENT CURRENTLY IT'S UNCERTAIN YOU KNOW THE CASE SO CHU SAYS WE WANT YOU TO RAMP UP WE WANT YOU TO SHUT DOWN THEY THEY DO THAT ON A RELIABILITY WHICH IS ADDING ANOTHER BLEND OF WELL. LET'S LOOK AT THE AIR QUALITY WHEN WE MAKE THAT DECISION OR GET THAT GET THAT INFORMATION THEIR QUALITY BECAUSE IT IS. IT IS UNCERTAIN RIGHT NOW THAT SOME OF THESE PLANTS IN DIFFERENT IN DIFFERENT REGIONS ARE STRUGGLING BECAUSE THEY WERE GONNA GET SO MANY PEOPLE WORKING AND THEY IF THEY'RE ONLY OPERATING THREE DAYS SINCE OF SEVEN DAYS THAT'S A ECONOMIC IMPACT. THAT'S GOING ON WITH THEIR WITHOUT S. B. SIXTY FOUR WE'RE SAYING THAT LET'S PUT IN BECAUSE IT MIGHT BE THAT ONE OF THOSE PLANS. THAT IS NOT OPERATING SO OFF SO OFTEN BECAUSE OF THE RELATIVE AIR QUALITY MIGHT GET. RAMPED UP IN THE STUDY MAY SHOW THAT THAT THIS IS THE THIS IS THE TO ONE FACILITY IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S THE FIRST TO RETIRE BECAUSE OF THESE. OTHER FACTORS AND THE AIR QUALITY. ALRIGHT SIR MCCARTY. THINK THAT I DIDN'T SEE THE AIR AIR BOARD I MEAN IN THE AIR QUALITY. DISTRICT FIT GROUP WAS A CALLED CAP GO CAT GO OUT. KEPCO IT'S LATE MEANS NETWORKING CAN CO I DIDN'T SEE THEM UP HERE. IN THE LINE UP AND THEY'RE THE ONES WHO ARE A BIG PART OF THIS HAVE YOU BEEN WORKING WITH THEM AND WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT BEING THE ENTITY THAT WOULD BE. AT THE FRONT LINES WORKING ON THIS. OKAY SO WE'VE HAD SEVERAL CONVERSATIONS WITH AIR DISTRICTS WE HAD A GOOD CONVERSATION WITH SOUTH BECAUSE I PERSONALLY HAVE NOT HAD A CONVERSATION WITH CAP COLA BUT I THINK. TO PARAPHRASE A CONVERSATION THAT WE HAD THEY'VE THEY RECOGNIZE THAT THIS COULD BE AN ISSUE IN FACT SOUTH COAST HAS PUT SOME ANNUAL LIMITATIONS ON START STOPS BECAUSE OF CONCERNS I HAVE ON ON KNOCKS ISSUES. THE PROBLEM IS THAT IT'S AN ANNUAL LIMITATION ON START STOPS IT'S NOT CONNECTED TO THE WORST AIR QUALITY DAYS SO. SO THEORETICALLY THE LIMITATION COULD STILL ALLOW THE PLANT TO START STOP IN THE DAYS THAT WOULD. WHERE STARTING AND STOPPING WOULD EXACERBATE AIR QUALITY I THINK BY THE AIR DISTRICTS HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT WHOSE RESPONSIBILITY IS IT TO WRAP UP? WRAP UP THE DATA THAT'S CURRENTLY BEING YEAH A AND MAKE IT MORE ACCESSIBLE THEY DO THEY ARE GETTING THAT DATA FROM EPA. BUT WHAT THE BILL WOULD DO WOULD BE TO REQUIRE THAT IT BECOME MORE ACCESSIBLE AND USER FRIENDLY. SO IN OTHER SOME QUESTIONS. ABOUT WHO DOES THAT WHERE THEY HAVE AN EXPRESS ANY CONCERNS ON THE TECHNICAL ASPECT OF THE IMPLEMENTATION NOT YET THEY HAVEN'T BEEN IN THE OFFICE FRIEDMAN DEALING WITH THE SPONSORS AND YET PROVIDING THEM WITH INFORMATION BUT NO. IF I MAY MR MCCARTY -- I SEE REPRESENTATIVE CAPITAL IN THE BAY AREA. AIR DISTRICT IT WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME FORWARD AND A PROVIDE ANY. OKAY JUST EXTENDING THE INVITATION [inaudible] ALRIGHT [inaudible] THERE WILL. YOU KNOW WHAT. TOM EDISON WITH THE BAY AREA QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT I'M HAPPY TO TRY DAY ANSWER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. I WOULD SAY THAT THE DAY YEAR YEAR DISTRICT DOES NOT HAVE A POSITION ON THIS BILL -- WE CERTAINLY HAVE A LOT OF THOUGHTS ABOUT. PETER PLANTS ARE EMISSIONS COMPETE HER PLANS. I DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES STRATEGIES FOR PAST IMPROVING PUBLIC HEALTH. AND REDUCING A MEASURE IN THE SOCIETY INCLUDING FROM POWER GENERATION -- BUT WE DON'T HAVE A POSITION ON THIS BILL HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. I'M ALAN ABBAS -- THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR WITH THE CALIFORNIA AIR POLLUTION CONTROL OFFICERS ASSOCIATION NOW REPRESENTING THE ITHIRTY FIVE AIR POLLUTION CONTROL OFFICERS. AGAIN CAP CHO HASN'T TAKEN A POSITION ON THIS BILL WE HAVEN'T RECEIVE DATA ABOUT WHAT WE HAVEN'T -- GOTTEN GUIDANCE FROM -- THE THE AIR DISTRICTS ON A WE DO HAVE OTHER ARE SOME SOME THINGS IN THIS BILL THAT WOULD BE VERY CHALLENGING FOR AIR DISTRICTS AND TO I'D ALSO BE ABLE. TO TALK WITH THE THE COMMITTEE ABOUT -- HOW WHERE DISTRICTS PERMIT THESE FACILITIES AND WHAT WE DO -- IN PREPARATION MAKE A PERMIT AND HOW WE'VE ALREADY DONE SOME OF THESE THINGS THAT WE THINK THE BILL -- ASKS US TO DO [inaudible] THANK. I'M SORRY MR MCCARTY I DIDN'T MEAN TO INTERRUPT BUT ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS WE'RE COMMITTED TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEIR DISTRICTS OBVIOUSLY. THE GOAL HERE. ALRIGHT ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. CENTER Y. CASKEY I WANTED -- TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR INTRODUCING THIS BILL TO ADDRESS OBVIOUSLY A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE WHICH IS THE IMPACT OF THE THE NATURAL GAS POWER PLANTS PARTICULARLY ON DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND AND FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE I LIKE HOW YOU TRY TO SEPARATE THE MISSION OF THE NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE FROM THE MISSION PERHAPS OF THE UTILITIES AND ENERGY COMMITTEE BUT OBVIOUSLY WE COME TO THIS -- DYESS A YOU KNOW WITH CONCERNS THAT MAY CROSS OVER -- FROM THE AIR QUALITY ISSUES TO THE ENERGY ISSUES MY PRIMARY CONCERN IS -- AS WE HEARD FROM THE REPRESENTED FROM CAP CO -- WHETHER THIS -- IT'S IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU ARE YOU ARE A ATTEMPTING TO PROVIDE A SOLUTION TO A VERY IMPORTANT PROBLEM BUT I'M NOT SURE IF THE SOLUTION THAT YOU'RE PRESENTING HIS WORKABLE. A WE HEARD WHEN CAP GO THAT -- THAT. YOU KNOW THERE MAY BE SOME. EXTREME CHALLENGES AND IMPLEMENTING. I PARTICULARLY THIS SIR. THE SYSTEM WELFARE DISTRICTS -- ISSUING TWENTY FOUR HOUR NOTICE IN COORDINATING THAT WITH THE BALANCING AUTHORITIES -- AND SO -- I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU -- YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE FEASIBILITY IN THE WORKABILITY. OF THIS SYSTEM. THIS -- NAM. INCREASED COOPERATION THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE BETWEEN AIR DISTRICTS AND AT THE BALANCING AUTHORITY. WELL I'M I MEAN YOU HAVE MY COMMITMENT TO TO WORK WITH DEAR DISTRICTS THEY PROVIDE US WITH YOU KNOW NOTICED THE PUBLIC WHEN WE HAVE A YOU KNOW A SMOG DAY THAT WERE. WERE NOT SUPPOSED TO GO OUTSIDE NAY WARN OUR KIDS AND AND AND THEY DO IT AND IT'S IT SEEMS TO BE THAT YOU KNOW I MIGHT BE WRONG ON THE TWENTY FOUR HOUR. A NOTICE I PICKED A TWENTY FOUR HOUR BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE WITH THE ACT CASE SO WHEN THEY WHEN THEY WE DON'T. SET UP THERE A DELIVERY OF THEIR ENERGIES AND THE NEXT THE NEXT DAY ON WHAT THEY DECIDE TO A CYCLE UPTURN AND CYCLE DOWN YOU DON'T. WE'RE DEALING WITH THE YOU KNOW THE CHALLENGES OF CLIMATE CHANGE SOMETIMES IT'S IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TECH TO COME WITH AN ANSWER MAYBE OF A LITTLE ABSTRACT THAT WERE A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO SAY OKAY. YOU YOU FOLKS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT IF THERE'S SOMETHING CONCRETE. THAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED IN THE BILL THAT MAKES IT UNWORKABLE I'M. I'M ALL EARS SADDAM I'M A WILLING TO TO DO THAT BUT THE A FOUNDATION OF IT THAT WE NEED TO GET THIS DATA WE NEED TO HAVE SOME SORT OF STUDY WE NEED TO HAVE THESE DISCUSSIONS. AND WE NEED TO COORDINATE WITH THE AIR DISTRICT AND THE AND THE CASE SO I THINK THOSE WHO. THOSE ARE -- DESIRABLE AND AND AGAIN AS I HAD SAID MENTIONED TO A ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- MELINDA'S WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING REGIONALLY WITH OUR PARTNERS AND IT'S GOOD TO BE. IMPERATIVE THAT WE THEIR DEAD ADAM WE HAVE THOSE DISCUSSIONS WITH THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT QUITE FRANKLY. AS AS CLEAN. A DANCING MACHINE AS BECAUSE OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL LOS WE'VE PUT UP THERE BEFORE. SO I MAYBE YEAH NO JUST ADD THEM BECAUSE IT DOES SEEM LIKE THERE'S SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THIS WOULD ACTUALLY WORKING IN REAL TIME SO THE TWENTY FOUR HOUR NOTICE IS MEANT. TO MAKE SURE THAT ANY DECISION ABOUT -- AN AIR AND AIR DISTRICT PLACING A LIMITATION ON THE ABILITY OF A POWER PLANT TO START UP WOULD HAPPEN WELL IN ADVANCE OF THE AYE SO SETTING THEIR DISPATCH STACK FOR THE DAY HAD ENERGY MARKET SO. OTHER WOMAN FROM THE CHAMBER MENTIONED THAT YOU KNOW GREAT RELIABILITY DECISIONS ARE BEING MADE MINUTE BY MINUTE THAT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE AND NOTHING ABOUT THIS BILL WOULD CHANGE THAT. ABILITY OF THE GRID OPERATOR TO MAKE THOSE MINUTE BY MINUTE DECISIONS THIS IS ALL PHYSICALLY IMPACTING WHAT WOULD BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE DAY HAD ELECTRICITY MARKET. AND THE OTHER INTENT IS FOR THE AIR DISTRICTS TO DO AN ANALYSIS UP FRONT OF WHEN GENERATION MAY BE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTING AIR QUALITY SO THAT WE'RE NOT STARTING FROM A BLANK SLATE EVERY SINGLE DAY. THAT WE HAVE A PRETTY GOOD IDEA OF WHAT POWER PLANTS WE MIGHT BE TALKING ABOUT WHAT TIMES OF THE YEAR MIGHT BE MOST PROBLEMATIC SO THAT. WE GO WELL INTO THE WEE GO INTO SEASONS WELL IN ADVANCE UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE OPTIONS ARE WHAT THE ALTERNATIVES ARE SO THAT IT'S NOT JUST MAKING THESE FLY BY NIGHT DECISIONS ARE AND I APPRECIATE [inaudible] TO IT OF THE AUTHORS EPCIS ON THE THE PLANNING AND THE DATA I THINK THE PROBLEM ARISES WHEN YOU. ARE AS MISTER SPUTNIK JONES INDICATED ARE GIVING THE POWER TO THE AIR DISTRICTS. TWO ENFORCE THESE OPERATING LIMITS AND AND AND AND AND SAID I THINK THERE IS A LEGITIMATE QUESTION AS TO WHETHER THE AIR DISTRICTS ARE IN THE BEST POSITION TO BE DOING THAT JOB OF OF BALANCING THE POWER -- WHAT THEY WHICH HAS TRADITIONALLY BEEN AND THE THE JURISDICTION OF OF OF THE N. NELSON AND IS EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM KNOWS? THIS IS A TOUGH PILL IN NATURAL RESOURCES AND THIS COULD BE A TOUGHER BILL AND ENERGY IN A A UTILITY SO I I UNDERSTAND THAT I'VE TALKED WITH THE OPPOSITION THEN AND WERE WELL AWARE BUT I'M. TRYING TO TO DEAL WIT THE AIR QUALITY PORTIONS OF IT AND THE DESIRABILITY OF OF IT IN AND DEAL WITH PART TWO ERIC WELL I ALSO SIT ON THE GO THE I KNOW I KNOW IT AND SOME GIVING A PREVIEW ACROSS OVER. SORRY IF I MIGHT -- I JUST WANTED TO POINT OUT THAT UNDER THE FEDERAL CLEAN AIR ACT AND THE STATE CLEAN OUR CLEAN AIR ACT THE AIR DISTRICTS HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY SPECIFICALLY. TO ENSURE THAT ALL OF THE STATIONARY SOURCES NONE OF THEM ARE OPERATING TO CONTRIBUTE TO VIOLATIONS OF AIR QUALITY STANDARDS THAT'S REALLY ALL THAT WE'RE ASKING TO HAVE HAPPEN HERE SO IT'S TRUE AS AND THE KEPT HER REPRESENTATIVE. STATED -- REQUIREMENTS ARE ALREADY WITHIN THE PURVIEW OF THE AIR DISTRICTS WHAT'S NEW IS THIS COMMUNICATION VEHICLE I WAS VERY INTERESTED TO HEAR THAT POWER PLANTS WOULD REFUSE TO RUN. IF ASKED TO DO SO BY CHI SO EVEN THOUGH THE SO DID THE CITY THE SITUATION OF CONTEMPLATED IS THAT THE AIR DISTRICTS IN FORMA PESO PESO THEN HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY NO. WE NEED THESE FOR RELIABILITY IF THE AIR DISTRICT IF. POWER PLANTS THEN REFUSED TO RUN I THINK THAT WOULD NOT BE A RESULT OF THIS PARTICULAR LAW THAT WOULD BE SOME OTHER KIND OF DECISION MAKING. IRATE. WELL LET ME LET ME JUST CONCLUDE. BY SAYING THAT I YOU KNOW SUPPORT WHO EAT THE OBJECTIVE OF YOUR BILL AND FOR THAT REASON LP RECOMMENDING GO -- EH DO PASS -- WITH THE AMENDMENTS. ACCEPTED -- AND WITH THIS CONVERSATION TO CONTINUE AND I HOPE THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS WILL FOLLOW YOUR LEAD THANK YOU WOULD YOU LIKE FLETCHER URGE NO I AIR TONIGHT VOTE I'M.

FOR YOUR WORK. ON MY MEASURE WITH S. B. TEN THIRTEEN WE ARE NARROWING IN ON THE ON THE LEAST KNOWN BUT MOST IN PART. FOR SUPER POLLUTANTS SP TENTATIVE ESTABLISHES AN INCENTIVE PROGRAM TO PROMOTE pREDUCTANT EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS. S. B. TEN THIRTEEN ALSO BACKSTOPS THE EPA SNAP RULES ON AGENCIES THAT WERE VACATED THIS FALL -- THE EPA SNAPROLLS WERE FINALIZED AFTER PUBLIC RULE MAKING PROCESS IN TWENTY SIXTEEN DURING THE EPA PROCESS CHARGE SIZE RULES CAME UP AS A PEER REGULATORY HURDLE FOR THE TRANSITION OF RESIDENTIAL REFRIGERATORS TO BETTER. REFRIGERANTS THE SNAPPED A LINE OF TWENTY TWO SIZE WOULD BE INCREASED IN TWENTY TWO OR TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO ALIGN WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD. YET EPA DID NOT ACT AND I IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AS EXPECTED AND WE BELIEVE THEY WORE INSTEAD ACT LATER THIS YEAR. WE RECOGNIZE THAT THIS DELAY HAS DELAYED THE ABILITY OF COMPANIES TO PREPARE FOR THE DEADLINES ARE FOR THE AMENDMENTS WERE TAKING TODAY REVISED THE DEADLINES FOR THE HOUSEHOLD REFRIGERATORS. APPROVAL TO PROVIDE A ONE YEAR EXTENSION TO TWENTY TWENTY TWO FOUR FOUR SIDE REFRIGERATORS AND TWENTY TWENTY THREE FOUR BUILT IN REFRIGERATORS THESE AMENDMENTS -- WILL BE ADDED IN THE BILL -- IN THE COMMITTEE THE CHANGE IN THE DEADLINE ACKNOWLEDGES THE CLEAR REGULATORY HURDLE AND PROVIDES A PATHWAY FOR TRANSITION TO ISOBUTANE ISOBUTANE -- HAS A GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL OF THREE A CURRENT AGENCIES HAVE A GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL OF FOURTEEN HUNDRED WE HAVE ALSO CLARIFY THAT THE AIR BE HAS THE AUTHORITY. AND FLEXIBILITY TO MODIFY THE SNAP DEADLINES TO ACHIEVE OUR ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS AND RESPOND THE TO AVAILABLE ALTERNATIVES. AND MEMBERS IN A WE WE SEE THE LATE LETTER OF OPPOSITION FROM CERTAIN MANUFACTURERS OF UNITARY AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEMS. HOWEVER THE EPA SNAP ROLLS DO NOT COVER THESE APPLICATIONS AND THEREFORE ARE OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF THIS BILL. THAT IS A SEPARATE AIR BE ISSUE AND THE BILL. I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE AND FOR THE WORK AND I APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE TO A GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHEN MEMBERS NIKITA CROWDED WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL HERE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SB. TEN THIRTEEN S. B. TURN TEN THIRTEEN PROVIDE CERTAINTY IN LEADERSHIP ANDREDUCING A MAJOR DRIVER OF CLIMATE CHANGE. AGENCIES ARE AND CAN BE THOUSANDS OF TIMES MORE POTENT A TRAPPING HEAT IN THE ATMOSPHERE THAN CO. TWO AND WORSE STILL THEY DO THEIR DAMAGE QUICKLY AND THEIR USES VOTE ON THE RISE BOTH IN CALIFORNIA AND AROUND THE WORLD. TO RESPOND TO THE THREAT THE EPA ESTABLISHED DEADLINES FOR PHASING OUT EACH OF THE THE MAJOR AND USES WERE ALTERNATIVES EXIST. AS PART OF ITS NOT PROGRAM ETCETERA ARE EXPLAINED HOWEVER THAT FEES DOWN WAS RECENTLY THROWN INTO LEGAL LIMBO CREATING SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY. BY ADOPTING IT INTO STATE LAW SB TEN THIRTEEN WILL KEEP THE GOAL POSTS IN PLACE AND CREATE A TEMPLATE FOR OTHER STATES TO FOLLOW AND PROVIDE MARKETS ANSWER AT MARKET CERTAINTY. THE CERTAINTY AFFORDED BY THIS BILL IS ALSO IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT'S NOT RULES ARE AN INTEGRAL PART OF CALIFORNIA'S PLANNED TO FEES DOWN EACH OF THESE ADELINE WITH A STATUTORY. TARGETS ADOPTED INFALLIBLE. THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE WHAT ARABIC COULD ADOPT THESE RULES YOUR REGULATION GOING THROUGH ANOTHER MAJOR ROLE MAKING DUPLICATES EPA'S PROCESS WILL ADD FURTHER UNCERTAINTY AND DELAY. TO THE PRODUCTION SCHEDULE THAT MEANS THOSE FOREGONE REDUCTIONS WILL NEED TO BE MADE UP ALMOST CERTAINLY A GREATER COST. WE CANNOT AFFORD TO BLOCKS BACKS LATER CLIMATE STRATEGIES AND WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE VOTE AND IF WE CAN. THIRTEEN GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS TOM MORRIS I'M THE DIRECTOR OF COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT FOR HONEYWELL'S FLOORING PRODUCTS DIVISION. HONEYWELL IS A LEADING PRODUCER FLOOR CARBON REFRIGERANTS BLOWING AGENTS AEROSOL PROPELLANTS I'M HERE TODAY FOR EXPERT TO EXPRESS HONEYWELL STRONG SUPPORT FOR SENATE BILL. TEN THIRTEEN I'VE BEEN WITH HONEYWELL FOR MORE THAN THIRTY THREE YEARS AND HAVE LED THE COMMERCIALIZATION OF SEVERAL INNOVATIVE REFRIGERANTS INCLUDING R. FOR TEN A WHICH IS USED IN HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF AIR CONDITIONERS ROUND THE WORLD. HONEYWELL IS LONG RECOGNIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF ADDRESSING AGENCIES THEIR IMPACT ON GLOBAL WARMING. AS THESE REGULATIONS WERE PROMULGATED AT EPA WE MADE A BUSINESS DECISION NOT TO SIT IDLE WE DID WHAT WE DO WE DECIDE TO MOVE FORWARD TO INNOVATE. IN ORDER TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION TO ADDRESS THIS REAL CLIMATE PROBLEM. TO THAT END HONEYWELL AND OTHERS HAVE SPENT MORE THAN ONE BILLION DOLLARS TO IDENTIFY AND COMMERCIALIZE. THE RANGE OF LOW IN REDUCED GWB PRODUCTS THAT CAN REPLACE MANY OF THE HIGH GLOBAL WARMING PRODUCTS IN USE TODAY OVER A BROAD RANGE OF APPLICATIONS. I WANT TO THANK SENATOR LARA AND THE OTHER SUPPORTERS FOR THEIR LEADERSHIP ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE. THANKS GOOD EVENING OF KEVIN MASTER OF THEM WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF HOME APPLIANCE MANUFACTURERS [inaudible] AND WE ARE HERE IN SUPPORT TODAY THIS IS A CHANGE OF OUR POSITION OF PEOPLE HEARD OF AND I CREDIT THAT TO CENTER LARA'S LEADERSHIP IN THE IN THE LAST FEW DAYS. TO REALLY I THINK THIS IS A CASE EXAMPLE THAT EVERYBODY ON THIS COMMITTEE SHE WOULD SUPPORT ENCOURAGE WHERE. PEOPLE LISTEN AND WE TALK AND WE COME UP WITH SOLUTIONS THAT ARE GOOD FOR CLIENTS MANUFACTURES GOOD FOR AN RTC I THINK THIS IS A REAL WIN FOR EVERYBODY TODAY. IDEAS FOR AUSTIN THAT I HOPE YOU SUPPORT IT THIS IS FOR US. IMPACTING EVERY HOUSEHOLD REFRIGERATOR IT'S IN EVERY HOME AND IT CAN BE A SHOWCASE FOR HOUSE CAN BE DONE RIGHT -- WE CAN GET THERE WE JUST NEEDED TO HAVE SOME ISSUES WHICH CHARGE SIZES AT EPA IT'S A TECHNICAL ENGINEERING ISSUE. AND THANK THE SENATOR LAURIE HAS RECOGNIZED THAT AND UNDERSTANDS IT AND I HAVE LETTERS HERE FROM GEE [inaudible] ELECTROLUX [inaudible] WHIRLPOOL -- INDIA. PSH BOSCH SIEMENS LOCATED IN IRVINE [inaudible] L. G.. DANFOSS THEY'RE ALL SUPPORTIVE OF THIS THIS IS THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT BILL IT PROVIDE CERTAINTY AND ALLOWS US TO GET TO THE CLIMATE FRIENDLY REFRIGERANTS. IN IRAQ IN THE RIGHT WAY THAT EVERYBODY CAN WIN SO WE'RE REALLY HAPPY TO BE HERE IN SUPPORT OF THIS AND A REALLY KARGES SHOULD BE. A REALLY EASY VOTE FOR EVERYONE HOPEFULLY THANK YOU. I AM RIGHT ON THE OUT SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIA SEAL CV AND ETF SUPPORT. GOOD EVENING PEOPLE COMING IN BEHALF OF INGERSOLL RAND AND TO OUR TRAIN BUSINESS WHEN THE LARGEST MANUFACTURERS OF CHILLERS AND UNITED STATES BEGIN TRANSITIONING TO NEXT GENERATION CHILLERS. IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN WILL HAVE A FULL SUITE. I HAVE A JEWELERS ON THE MARKET NEXT DURATION CHILLERS BY TWENTY TWENTIES IS A GREAT BILL MERGER SUPPORT THANK YOU. MICROBES IN HERE ON BEHALF OF THE COMMERCIAL COMPANY CHEMICAL COMPANY IN THE REFRIGERANT SPACE AND IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. MCCLOSKEY ON BEHALF OF* HERE IN SUPPORT. AND FOR THE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. AND WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL PLEASE COME FOR I I CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MY NAME IS MIKE HEALTH PARLIAMENT THE BALKAN GROUP I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF CARRIER CORPORATION AND UNITED TECHNOLOGIES ANOTHER ONE OF THE LARGEST MANUFACTURERS OF CHILLERS AND UNITARY EACH BACK PRODUCTS. THINK IT'S OUR LETTER THAT THAT THE SENATOR MENTIONED -- WE ARE MANUFACTURERS MAJOR MANUFACTURERS CHILLERS -- THERE BE STIRRED ACTIVITY WHICH WHICH IS ALREADY OUT THERE IN TERMS OF RIGHT THE PROMULGATION THEY'VE THEY'VE ADOPTED -- SAP TWENTY THAT THEY'RE PROPOSING TO ADOPT SNAP -- TWENTY ONE THE PRELIMINARY RIGS THERE ARE. YOU KNOW CONCEPTS ARE OUT THERE AND IT SHOWS THEY ARE BE NEEDING TO SURPASS THE TIMELINES AND SNAP. TWENTY ONE FOR CHILLERS WHICH WE MANUFACTURE. IN THAT TERM -- THEIR TRAJECTORY IN THEIR EXPLORATION GOES BEYOND WHAT WAS NEGOTIATED WITH THE US EPA ON THESE ISSUES -- CODES AND STANDARDS SUCH AS FIRE CODES IN THE UNIVERSAL MAKING AND THE UNIFORM A CANTICLE CODE. WILL NOT BE IN PLACE. FOR POTENTIALLY FLAMMABLE. OR POTENTIALLY MORE TOXIC REFRIGERANTS. BY. TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND THAT'S THAT'S THE TIME WHEN THAT AIR HE'S LOOKING FOR NOW I UNDERSTAND AMENDMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN PROPOSED IN REGARDS TO ALLOWING DISCRETION. LAST SET HAD ACCELERATE WHICH CAUSED OUR CONCERN. NOW IF WE ARE WILLING TO LOCK IN CERTAIN TIMELINES FOR CERTAIN PRODUCTS INCLUDING TWENTY TWENTY NINE FOR UNITARY PRODUCTS AS NEGOTIATED WITH. GINA MCCARTHY WHEN SHE IS THE ADMINISTRATOR OF THE US EPA I THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION WERE WILLING. TO TO MOVE SITES AS WELL AS OTHERS HAVE HAVE [inaudible] DONE. BUT AT THIS TIME PART ARE PRETTY PREDOMINANT CONCERN IS STILL THE SAFETY OF THE EMPLOYEES AND THAT THEN THE PEOPLE IN THE BUILDINGS AND UNITS. THAT WILL HAVE THESE REFRIGERANTS THAT THAT ARE POTENTIALLY TOXIC AND POTENTIALLY FLAMMABLE WHEN COMPARED TO THE CURRENT. IN COMMON USE MATERIALS. AND O FOR THAT I THINK THERE'S A COUPLE OTHERS THAT THAT WILL EXPRESSED SIMILAR CONCERNS BUT IT BUT WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR WE ARE WE ARE THE LARGEST MANUFACTURERS OF OF CHILLERS AND UNITARY AGE FACTS AND WE WE DO YOU BELIEVE THE AIR BE IS GOING BEYOND. WHAT THE CO TIMINGS ARE THERE WILL NOT BE ADOPTED CODES FOR THESE FLAMMABLE UNITS BY THAT TIME? AND IF WE'RE WILLING TO LOCK THAT IN AND NOT GIVE AIR BE THE DISCRETION TO MOVE TIMELINES ON US. THEN WE CAN CERTAINLY. TALK ABOUT MOVING OUR POSITION BUT AT THIS POINT GIVING THEM THE SOLE DISTRACTION WHEN THEY'RE NOT EXPERTS ON EACH BACK. CC MIGHT BE. BUT BUT I'M NOT GONNA GIVE THAT AUTHORITY TO THE AIR BE. ARE BEFORE WE GO FOR IT THERE -- AS IS STANDARD PROCEDURE WE ALLOW THE SUPPORTERS IN OPPOSITION THREE IS TWO MINUTES EACH [inaudible] SO. I SEE FOR SETTLEMENTS IS SEATED THERE YOU ARE. SELECT AMONG YOURSELVES WHO WANTS TO BE THE NEXT. A MEDIUM IN THIS WEEK WHICH I THOUGHT JUST REAL QUICK CHRIS WALKER BEHALF THE SHEET METAL AIR CONDITIONING CONTRACTORS REPRESENTING FOUR HUNDRED CONTRACTOR STATEWIDE. POINT TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND MEN WOMEN -- WE FOLLOW CODE AND IN CALIFORNIA WE FOLLOW THE CALIFORNIA MECHANICAL CODE WHICH IS BASED ON THE UNIFORM MECHANICAL CODE ADOPTED EVERY THREE YEARS WE CANNOT BE WORKING ON SYSTEMS THAT DO NOT FOLLOW CODE COMPLIANCE. SO WHAT WE HAVE AN ISSUE WITH WHERE WE'RE AT POSE UNLESS AMENDED A WE HAVE NO ISSUES WITH WITH MOVING FORWARD TO TO BETTER REFRIGERANTS THAT ARE. A BETTER ON GWP -- BUT EVERYTHING HAS ITS TIME AND PLACE AND I I KNOW THAT THEY RESOURCES BOARD MUST TAKE IN THE OVERALL RISK IN HEALTH. AND THE ENVIRONMENT -- HOWEVER. WHEN GLOBAL WARMING IS CONSIDERED? OUR THE DOUBTS OR SICKNESSES OF INDIVIDUAL PEOPLE OF WHAT WHERE'S THE COMPARATIVE RISK. AND SO WE GET CONCERNED GIVING A ARE BE THE TOTAL AUTHORITY UNFETTERED BY CODE BODIES IF SOMEHOW THEY CONSTRAINED BY CODE. AND THEY WERE WORKING WITH THOSE CO BODIES WE WOULD BE OKAY WITH THE BILL WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THE SAFETY OF OUR WORKERS. THE SAFETY IN OCCUPANTS OF OUR BUILDINGS THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS INTO A WILL BE BRIEF RESPECT HERE FOR THE LATENESS AND FOR OTHER WITNESS YOU LIKE I SEE A FOR THE DOW CHEMICAL COMPANY MANUFACTURES OF A NUMBER OF PRODUCTS THAT ARE AFFECTED. BY THE PHASE OUT PROPOSE AN SP TEN THIRTEEN SPECIFICALLY FOAM INSULATION YOU'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT REFRIGERANTS. BUT WHAT DOW CHEMICAL COMPANY MAKES IS THE FOAM INSULATION THAT YOU MIGHT BE FAMILIAR ITS UBIQUITOUS THROUGHOUT THE RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL. BUILDING AND IS AN ESSENTIAL PRODUCT FOR MEETING OUR ENERGY EFFICIENCY STANDARDS IN CALIFORNIA. OUR CONCERN IS THAT BY TAKING A BIT OF THE SNAP REGULATION AND DROPPING IT INTO CALIFORNIA CODE. AND ACTUALLY A BIT OF IT BECAUSE WHAT YOU TOOK HERE WAS THE DEADLINE TO PHASE OUT NOT THE ENTIRETY OF THEIR REGULATION WHICH ALLOWS FOR CONTINUED. A RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CONTINUED IN IT -- INVOLVEMENT BETWEEN THE REGULATED PARTIES AND EPA TO DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF ALTERNATIVES AT EXACTLY WHAT THE DOW CHEMICAL COMPANY HAS BEEN DOING SINCE. TWENTY FIFTEEN WE HAVE BEEN INVESTING MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS RESEARCH DEVELOPMENT DEMONSTRATING TO EPA THE FEASIBILITY OR NON FEASIBILITY OF ALTERNATIVES. WE HAVE YET TO FIND. A SUITABLE REPLACEMENT FOR THAT UBIQUITOUS INSULATION PRODUCT THAT IS NECESSARY IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE NOT YET FOUND AND INSULATION PRODUCT. THAT MEANS CALIFORNIA'S TITLE TWENTY FOUR STANDARDS THAT MEETS CALIFORNIA'S HIGH FLAMMABILITY STANDARDS. SO YOU'VE HEARD WHAT YOU HEARD FROM SO THE SUPPORTERS THAT WE HAVE PRODUCTS THERE IN HOUSTON ALL OVER THE WORLD. THAT MAY BE TRUE BUT THEY'RE NOT IN USE IN CALIFORNIA AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD ASK YOU TO TAKE SPECIAL -- MIND OF THAT WE NEED PRODUCTS THAT NOT ONLY MEET THE SNAP REGULATION TIMELINES THAT MEET OUR UNIQUE CALIFORNIA. ENERGY EFFICIENCY STANDARDS. AND OUR FLAMMABILITY STANDARDS SO WE A WE DO WANT TO WORK WITH A SENATOR AND WE DO SEE THAT THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS HERE ARE AN ATTEMPT. TO PROVIDE MORE FLEXIBILITY TO THE AIRPORT -- BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE CLEAR ON WHAT THE FLEXIBILITY BASED ON WHAT. TITLE TWENTY FOUR STANDARDS FLAMMABILITY STANDARDS THE TYPES OF CONSIDERATIONS THAT EPA WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE TODAY TO DECIDE WHETHER THEY'RE IN FACT IS A VIABLE ALTERNATIVE. SO AGAIN BUT WE WE DO OPPOSE THEM UNLESS I'M IN A POSITION BUT WE DO WANT CONTENT OR FOR THE SENATE AND THE STAFF ON FINDING A SOLUTION THANK YOU ARE I THINK YOU. MR CHAIRMAN -- JUST BRIEFLY. THAT'S BECAUSE I AS I STATED THAT EACH SIDE HAS THREE MAIN WITNESSES. ALLOW YOU -- GO A BRIEF PERIOD TIME TO MAKE A CASE. THANK YOU AND I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE -- THE COMMITTEE'S RULES BY SIMPLY SAYING -- KEVIN WASHINGTON WITH ILLINOIS TOOL WORKS -- WE'VE REGISTERED A LATER IT OUT IT OPPOSITION UNLESS AMENDED AND I IN THE INTEREST OF TIME IN THE COMMITTEE'S RULES -- WHILE WE HAVE ATTEMPTED TO WORK WITH THE CHAIR UPS USE ME WITH THE OUT BILL AUTHORED A IN THE PAST WE LOOK FORWARD. A TO CONTINUE TO DO SO LOOKING FOR AN OPPORTUNITY -- TO MOVE FROM OPPOSITION TO NEUTRAL -- AND HOPE THAT THE COMMITTEE WILL HELP US FACILITATE THAT ACTION BUT CURRENT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS JOHN NORWOOD ON BEHALF OF OUR KAMALA AND MEXICAN FLOOR. AND WERE OPPOSE THE BILLS WELL BECAUSE IT. ELIMINATES OUR EXAMS THE BOARD FROM THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE PROCESS IS DESIGNED TO EXAMINE THESE VERY ISSUES AND THAT WE'RE JUST GOING. TO SAY GO AHEAD AND DO IT WITHIN YOUR TO THANK YOU. AND APRICOT FILTHY WITH APEX GROUP -- ON BEHALF OF LENNOX INTERNATIONAL WHERE OPPOSE THEM AS AMENDED PRIMARILY FOR SAFETY CONCERNS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE MS REYES. THE ONE THING THAT I DID HEAR THAT -- THAT I HOPE YOU'LL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION ON IS THE SAFETY OF THE EMPLOYEES. I HEARD THAT FROM AT LEAST TWO OF THE OPPOSITION -- AND I WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE THAT CONTINUED DISCUSSION THANK YOU THANK YOU. THE MANAGEMENT THE FOSTER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO I I HAVE. A FEW QUESTIONS HERE -- FOR ONE FOR THE AUTHOR COUPLE FOR THE AUTHOR SO. APOLOGIZE I WAS OUT OF THE ROOM AND THE COMMITTEE FOR FROM HERE BUT DISCARD CURRENTLY HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO TIM TO MAKE REGULATIONS FOR THIS BECAUSE MY UNDERSTANDING. THAT THE CARD IS ALREADY IN THE PROCESS OF MAKING THEIR OWN THEIR OWN RULES ON THAT. YES CARVE ALREADY HAS THE JURISDICTION TO DO SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS CREATE INCENTIVE PROGRAM A GREAT THE APPROPRIATE TIME LINES. PUT THOSE IN STATUTES SO THAT WE CAN ALLOW FOR THE TRANSITION OF OF THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND ALSO ALLOW THE FLEXIBILITY. FOR CARD IF EPA DOES A TRANSITION TO WORK OR APPROVED NEW TECHNOLOGY THAT THOSE ARE ADOPTED AS WELL SO TRYING TO CREATE THE FLEXIBLY THAT WE NEED. WHAT THE INCENTIVE PROGRAM LIKE RESOURCE THAT'S ME SUCCESSFULLY HAVE DONE WITH THE METHANE REDUCTION? UP PIECE OF THAT WE SUPPORTED A COUPLE YEARS AGO. OH OKAY SO WITH THAT BEING SAID DOES THIS SO AS WE'VE HEARD SOME TESTIMONY ON DOES THE CIRCUMVENT THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES ACT AND ALLEVIATE THE CONFERENCE OF ANALYSIS JUSTIFICATION REQUIRED BY THE ACT AND ALL THAT TIPS TO SAY THAT. WE'VE GOT SO MANY OTHER PIECES OF THE PUZZLE HERE TITLE TWENTY FOUR THE FLAMMABILITY STANDARDS OF SAFETY RAGS. IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT NO ONE CAN USE THIS. THESE THESE PRODUCTS AT THIS POINT EVEN IF THE STANDARDS WERE THERE TODAY BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE NOT. IS THAT THEY'RE NOT APPROVING A PRIEST IN CALIFORNIA. YEAH THIS KEVIN MASTER THE ASSOCIATIONAL APPLIANCE MANUFACTURERS OF SANTORUM WERE WERE SUPPORT OF THIS BILL NOW AND IT IT. CARP DOES HAVE THE AUTHORITY BUT YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GONNA DO. AND SO THERE'S SO MUCH UNCERTAINTY RIGHT NOW WITH COURT CASES IN EPA AND CANADA GOLLY. THAT THIS BILL. DOES TO PROVIDE THE CERTAINTY SO YOU HAVE YOU KNOW NOW WE KNOW NOW THE DATES THAT WE NEED TO HIT. AND AND CARP HAS THE FLEXIBILITY SO WE WE HAVE A CHARGE SIZE ISSUE THAT NO WE NEED TO GO AFTER WITH A HUNDRED FIFTY GRAMS AND SO THIS FLEXIBILITY DOES RIGHT YOU YOU WE HAD A CONVERSATION EARLIER LAST WEEK ABOUT THIS VERY ISSUE AND I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE GOING OFF. OPPOSITION I'M I'M FRANKLY. SHOCKED AT THE SUPPORT. OF BECAUSE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT IN MY OFFICE BUT WE'RE ONLY ADDRESSING HALF THE ISSUE HERE -- AS WAS STATED WE PRIOR TO THIS SENATE MEETINGS THAT I'VE HAD. IF THIS STANDARD WERE ADOPTED AND AND IF YOU'RE INDUSTRY HAD GONE TO THESE PRODUCTS TO MEET FOR EXAMPLE TO DO WHAT THE AB ISOBUTANE. YOU WOULD BE ABLE SOUND TODAY. YOU HAVE WAREHOUSES FULL OF YET FOR COMPLETELY FOLLOW THE BELIEVER HERE AND WELL SO THAT'S THAT'S A BIT OF A PROBLEM BECAUSE THERE BE PEOPLE TODAY. THAT FRANKLY WHO WENT TO THE STANDARD CALIFORNIA WOULD BE LEVINE REFRIGERATOR. AND THERE'S ALSO PEOPLE AND I APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR YEAH I'M GONNA GO BACK TO TO ASK OTHER TRAUMA FROM CARRIER AND I I I WELCOME ANYONE TO TO ANSWER THIS I ALSO LIKE TO ASK THE SHEET METAL CONTRACTORS A QUESTION AS WELL IT WITH THE CHURCH INDULGENCE IF YOU. DON'T MIND -- BECAUSE I IF THERE'S THERE'S TO WE HAVE COMPETING INTERESTS AND EVERYTHING THAT WE DO IN THIS STATE AND OBVIOUSLY WE WANT THE THE THE CLEANEST AIR THE SAFEST PRODUCTS THAT. THE LOWEST COSTS ALL THE THINGS THAT WE CAN TRY TO ACHIEVE SEEMS TO ME THAT WERE IN A POSITION RIGHT NOW WHERE ALL OF A SUDDEN WE HAVE A BREAKING RANKS AND WE HAVE. A HUGE PART OF THE INDUSTRY THAT IS NOT ABLE TO AND TO MEET THESE GUIDELINES AND I'M VERY CONCERNED WITH THAT MISSED HER I JUST WANT. TO JUST CLARIFY THAT THEIR ART CHILLERS CURRENTLY RIGHT NOW WITH NEW TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE OPERATING IN THE U. S.. I I'M SURE THERE ARE BUT WHAT ABOUT ISSUES LIKE. YOU KNOW THESE THESE THESE MANDATES COME DOWN AND NOW WE'VE GOT PEOPLE THAT HAVE THE OTHERS KNOW BACKWARDS COMPATABILITY HERE THAT'S NO WAY TO REPAIR THE SEE THESE THESE OF THE BEAST BEAS CHILLERS THESE LARGE AC UNITS THE H. BACK SYSTEMS OF OUR HEARD ABOUT IT. I MEAN THERE'S A LOT OF ISSUES THAT I THINK FRANKLY IN THIS BILL KIND OF YOU KNOW KIND OF SIDE STEPS I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT A SO -- IT IS MIX OF THEY ARE MAKE YOU WOULD MIND I'M ASK THEM THAT WITH CHAIRS DOSE AGAIN I'M WATER THE RELEVANT CODES AND STANDARDS THAT HAVE TO BE ACHIEVED BEFORE YOU CAN MOVE FORWARD WITH REPLACEMENTS WHAT ARE WE MISSING THEIR THESE YOU MENTIONED IT. EARLIER ON YEAH I THINK FIRST AND FOREMOST WE HAVE TO GET THE THE UNIFORM A CANTICLE CODE IN PLACE TO ALLOW FOR A TWO WELLS RICHARD OR THE MILDLY FINAL REFRIGERANTS. WHICH WHICH IS A BIG PART OF THIS NOT NOW THERE MAY BE SOME FOLKS OUT THERE WHO HAVE WITH YOU KNOW A OF A B.. TO WHICH IT IS HIGHER TOXICITY BUT BUT LOWER FLAMMABILITY ERRED IN ALONG THOSE LINES YOU SEE SO THERE'S A NUMBER OF OPTIONS THAT ARE COMING OUT THEN YOU HAVE SOME SOME GLIDES WITCHER -- KIND OF BLAND'S MEN AND IN OUR PERSPECTIVE IT AS CARRIER WE DON'T THINK THAT YOU KNOW GOING THAT BLENDED OR OUTGOING EARLY IS GOING TO GET TO THE THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE GOAL BASED ARM MALI. AND THAT THAT EXTRA TIME COULD BE USED FOR FOR RECYCLING RECOVERY OF EXISTING REFERRED ANGELES HAS A LIKE 9% ACCORDING TO AIR BEES. NOW SAYS. IT'S NOT THAT WERE UNSUPPORTIVE OF GOING THE LOW GWP PATHWAY WERE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THAT WE'RE WE'RE A HAD HAD. THE ENGINEERING STAFF AND AND COMPLIANCE STAFF FLYING BACK AND FORTH TO TO WORK ON THE COULD ALL YOU GREEN. AND AND ALL THOSE NEGOTIATED POLICIES BUT WE HAVE YOU KNOW IF YOU LOOK AT THE SNAP RULE IT IT FOR CHILLERS IT SAYS TWENTY TWENTY FOUR AND THE JUSTIFICATION IS. TOO LOUD RELEVANT CODES AND STANDARDS TO GET A PLACE THAT INCLUDES THE FIRE CODES. THE FIRE CODES IT IF IF YOU'RE MOVING TOWARDS A A PROPANE OR OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT FOR AND THIS ISN'T TALKING. NOTE THAT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FIFTY GRAMS A HUNDRED FIFTY GRAMS AN INTERPRETER AT WORK WERE TALKING POUNDS OR TONS. IF IT'S A MUCH GREATER QUANTITY IN THESE BUILDINGS. YEAH I I I APPRECIATE THAT AND I THINK THE RECYCLING PIECE OF THIS SHOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD BE MOVING TO THE RECYCLE AND REUSE WARY DO AN AUTOMOTIVE FIGHT COME FROM THAT WORLD AND WE'VE BEEN IT THERE FOR YEARS -- IT'S REQUIREMENT -- IS NOW THAT THE THE SHEET METAL WAS THAT YOU CAN'T TO SET THINGS RIGHT I'M CITING CATCH YOUR NAME I THOUGHT I'D MIX NAY BUT NEVER GROUP CHRIS WATER CHRIS WALKER OKAY THINKS CHRIS APPRECIATED -- MISTER WALKER SO. KIND OF A GUY CAN TO THAT WAS WHAT SAFETY STANDARDS THAT'S JUST THE TALK CITY TOXIC CITY TOXICITY OR FLAMMABILITY NEED TO BE MET. OUGHT TO ENSURE ANY REPLACE SOME PRODUCTS ARE SAFE FOR THE INSTALLERS AND TECHNICIANS -- FOR YOU KNOW CURRENT PER POTENTIAL FUTURE YOU MENTIONED SAFETY UP ANOTHER ANOTHER -- COMMITTEE MEMBER MENTIONED SAFETY HAVING SOME EXPERTISE OR SOME EXPERIENCE IN THIS WORLD I I CAN TELL YOU THAT YOU KNOW THIS ISN'T. OUR TWELVE ARE ONE THIRTY FOUR A IN YOUR CAR AND THEY JUST MIX AND NEXT MESS UP YOUR COMPRESSOR. THIS IS FAR MANY MAGNITUDES ABOVE THAT SO WE GAVE AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURERS NATIONWIDE MANY YEARS TO PHASE THAT BOTH PRODUCTS AND AND THE CONSUMER MANY YEARS FOR REPLACEMENTS AND FOR OUR TWELVE IN ITS ETRE. A BEFORE WE YOU KNOW COMPLETELY PUSHED IN PRICE AT THE MARKET THIS IS A MUCH BIGGER SYSTEM THAT WHAT'S IN YOUR AUTOMOBILE AND ULTIMATELY THESE BUILDINGS ARE REPLACED EVERY YEAR LIKE. THE OUR TOUR FOR YEARS OR SIX YEARS LIKE A CAR SO CAN YOU TOUCH ON THAT THAT -- SURE TOXICITY EARLY CAN WE CAN WE HAVE I MEAN WHAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW WHAT WE'RE USING HYDRA FLUOROCARBONS WHICH ARE NOT PREFERABLE GIVEN THE GWP THAT LOCAL WORKING POTENTIAL OF THESE GASES. ARE THE SAFEST OUT THERE RIGHT NOW ANYTHING THAT WE GO -- IS GOING TO GO DOWN THE THAT THAT THE PATH OF MORE TOXIC OR MORE FLAMMABLE AND EVERYTHING'S A TRADE OFF. AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT HOW WE'RE GONNA HANDLE THESE THINGS IT'S A VERY DELIBERATIVE PROCESS WITH INDUSTRY WITH MANUFACTURERS CHEMICAL COMPANIES. ARE LABOR IT CETERA IN HOW ARE WE GONNA WRAP OURSELVES WHAT CAN A CODES NEED TO BE ADOPTED TO HANDLE IF MORE FLAMMABLE SUBSTANCE FOR EXAMPLE OR FOR GOING TO BE DEALING WITH A MORE TOXIC SUBSTANCE. WHAT ARE THE CODES I HAVE TO GO AROUND THAT AS YOU CAN IMAGINE IT'S A VERY COMPETITIVE ATMOSPHERE -- IN IN IN THE INDUSTRY ARE DIFFERENT COMPANIES ARE ARE TRYING TO USE THE PROCESS TO GET AHEAD OF OTHERS WE JUST INSTALLED PROBE THAT THE EQUIPMENT WE MAINTAIN THE EQUIPMENT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE. THAT WE GET THERE WE GET THERE SAFELY -- WE DO YOU THINK THAT THAT CAN HAPPEN -- AND WE'RE WE'RE NOT. OBJECTING TO TIMELINES BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CODE BODIES AREN'T BEING STEPPED OVER. AND DISREGARDED WE NEED THOSE COLORED BODIES TO BE LOCK STEP WITH WHATEVER THEY ARE BE IS DOING CURRENTLY THE BILL DOES NOT ALLOW THAT IT ALLOWS THEY ARE BE. TO CIRCUMVENT THE CODE BODIES. RIGHT AND THERE WAS A REASON WHY HAD YOU GO SECOND -- AND THAT'S BECAUSE WE HEARD FROM A MANUFACTURER'S STANDPOINT -- I'M TECHNOLOGY OR MANUFACTURING GNOSTIC ON THIS BUT THEN IT COMES DOWN TO BECAUSE THEY CAN THEY'RE GONNA WIN OR LOSE THAT BATTLE BUT THEN IT COMES DOWN TO THE ACTUAL YOU KNOW BOOTS ON THE GROUND AND THESE ARE FOLKS THAT. THAT WITH ALL RESPECT TO THE AUTHOR THAT THAT ARE ACTUALLY DOING THIS WORK AND THERE'S A LOT OF AREAS HERE THAT I HEAR FROM -- MY CONSTITUENTS AND FROM THE H. BACK INSTALLERS JUST. TODAY -- PARTICULARLY AND I I WANNA I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT FOLKS UNDERSTAND SOMETHING HERE IF YOU HAVE TO REPLACE OR REPAIR UNITS YOU COULD BE IN A SITUATION THIS AUGUST. IN CALIFORNIA WITH OUR HEAT WHERE YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO DO IT DEPENDING WHAT CARD DOESN'T HOW FAST THEY MOVE I'M NOT THIS AUGUST BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING. THESE ARE THE SITUATIONS THAT WE FIND OURSELVES IN WERE WERE GETTING AHEAD OF THE TECHNOLOGY OR GETTING AHEAD OF THE RAGS BECAUSE WE CAN'T IGNORE THE REGULATORY THE SAFETY -- AND THAT AND SIDE OF THIS THING AND I AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT. I AM VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE CONCEPT TRYING TO DO HERE -- MISTER LARA BUT IT WOULD JUST THERE'S ALMOST SAID WE HAVE THIS THIS BIFURCATION AND I JUST SIMPLY NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THAT I WILL SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY BUT I WOULD REALLY WANT. THIS TO BE FIXED SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE HERE BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE GONNA WE'RE GOING HEADLONG INTO A TO AN ISSUE THAT I'VE SEEN BEFORE SOMEONE IS. USE THESE PRODUCTS. ALRIGHT THANK YOU ANY FURTHER. QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. I I JUST LIKE TO BRIEFLY -- ASCO EITHER HONEYWELL OR THE ASSOCIATION TO RESPOND TO MR COACHES. INSURANCE SURE OUT WITH I THINK ONE THING CLARIFY THIS BILL ADDRESSES ONLY CHILLERS SNAP. DEALS WITH THAT AND CHILLERS ARE DIFFERENT AND UNLIKE YOUR HOME AIR CONDITIONER I JUST HAD MINE REPLACED TWO WEEKS AGO YOU DON'T KNOW WHO'S COMING UP. IT CHILLERS TYPICALLY EITHER PLACED IN A CONTROLLED ACCESS ROOM. SERVICE BY PROFESSIONALS TYPICALLY ALARMED VENTILATION REQUIREMENTS WELL SPECIFIED WORKPLACE THAT'S TODAY. ALL THE LEADING KILLER MANY FACTORS INCLUDING CARRIER HAS MULTIPLE OPTIONS SO MUCH OF PLAYABLE SOME WHICH ARE NOT -- THEY HAVE A PRODUCT CALLED ONE TWO THREE THREE Z. DE WHICH TRAIN CARRIER JOHNSON CONTROLS DAIKIN AND OTHERS SELL TODAY THAT IS NON FLAMMABLE I UNDERSTAND THEY'RE USED IN. OF CALIFORNIA JUST RECENTLY THERE WAS A PRESS RELEASE WHERE A TRAIN REPLACE THE FOR CHILLERS IN THE CHANNEL WHICH IS THE TYPICAL PANEL DOES UNDER THE AND FROM THE UK FRANCE. WHERE THEY WERE PLACED FOR LARGE CHILLERS WITH BREEZY DE CHILLERS TRAIN AND REDUCED -- THOSE CHILLERS IN TWENTY FOURTEEN SO GIVING THEM TEN YEARS TIME SEEMS TO YOUR POINT YOU DON'T WANT TO MOVE TOO QUICKLY BUT TENURE SEEMS. THAT REASONABLY PROVED THERE ABOUT FIFTEEN PEOPLE TODAY OFFERING LOW GDP CHILLERS WITH REGARD TO THE CODES THE OTHER CODE BODIES HAVE ALREADY ADDRESSED WITH NICOLE. INDIRECT SYSTEMS WHICH ARE CHILLERS. A DIRECT ESTAMOS IN YOUR HOME THE AIR CONDITIONER THE REFRIGERANT COULD FLOW THROUGH BUT INDIRECT SYSTEM ALL THAT REFRIGERANT STAYS EITHER IN THAT LOCKED MECHANICAL ROOM OR SO I THINK IT IS A DIFFERENT SITUATION. IF I MAY MISTER WITH YOUR SOLDIERS ARE BECAUSE IT WAS DIRECTED AT ME -- IN RESPONSE TO THE QUESTION I HAD I UNDERSTAND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CHILL BUT WE'RE ALSO TALKING ABOUT YOUR EAR YOU YOU WERE ABLE TO GO DOWN TO ONE MANUFACTURER THAT'S NOT THE ISSUE HERE. THE ISSUE THAT I WAS TRYING TO GET AT IS THE FACT THAT. THERE ARE FOLKS FROM INDUSTRY THAT ARE COMING TO US AND SAYING THERE ISN'T THERE ARE LEGITIMATE SAFETY CONCERNS HERE SO AYE I DON'T THINK WE WE NEED TO GOING TO BACK AND FORTH ALREADY STATED MY POSITION. BUT THAT DOES NOT ADDRESS THE THE THE THE THOUSANDS OF TECHNICIANS OUT THEIR THAT WE'RE GONNA GET A HEAD OF FROM THE SAFETY STANDPOINT I'VE TALKED TO PEOPLE IN THE IN THE FIRE SAFETY WE ARE PROGRAMS FIREFIGHTERS. I'VE TALKED TO PEOPLE IN BUILDING AND SAFETY IN CODES I COME FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT WE'VE GOT THE CART BEFORE THE HORSE HERE BUT I'VE. I'VE SAID MY PIECE I APPRECIATE INDOLENCE OF THE CHAIR AND MY FELLOW MEMBERS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SETTLER WAS LIKE LOS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR APPRECIATE THE THE CONVERSATION AND ALSO JUST FOR THE RECORD OPEN ALSO CARE ABOUT THE SAFETY OF FOLKS. ARE NOT TO MAKE AN ASSUMPTION THAT DIDN'T BUT AGAIN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CHILLERS HERE WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT. A TRACK SYSTEMS AND WILL YOU HAVE A METHODICAL APPROACH WHEN IT COMES TO BUILDING SAFETY AND THAT PROCESS FITS OUR TIMELINES. A IT WE JUST WANT TO CONFLATE THE TWO ISSUES AND MAKE IT DIFFERENT OF THE FACT IS THAT TECHNOLOGY IS ALREADY EXIST. AYE AND THE FACT THAT WE ACTUALLY. SAT UP THE TABLE AND HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH INDUSTRY AND BROUGHT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF INDUSTRY IN SUPPORT OF THE MEASURE SHOULDN'T SURPRISE YOU HAVEN'T YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT MY FIRST RODEO -- AND WE ACTUALLY LISTEN TO INDUSTRY AND SO WE HAVE A BIG SEGMENT OF THE INDUSTRY NOW WHO'S IN SUPPORT. BECAUSE WE UNDERSTOOD THAT THEY NEED THE TIME GOING TO NEED THE FLEXIBILITY WE WANT TO MAKE SURE OF THAT WHEN EPA RULES. THAT E. R. R. UM. RTP HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADOPT TO WHATEVER NEW TECHNOLOGIES ARE BEING ADDRESSED OR WHATEVER THEN THE DEADLINES ARE TIMES ARE. SO I MEAN I THINK WE'VE DONE OUR DUE DILIGENCE IN TRYING TO REALLY GET TO THE CRUX OF THE ISSUE HERE BUT DON'T WANT TO CONFLATE. THE ISSUES BETWEEN A TRAP AND ABOUT I THINK THIS IS A GOOD START THE CONCERN AS A MODEL FOR THE REST OF THE COUNTRY I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR OUR BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- MADAM SECRETARY MOTIONS BEEN MADE AND SECONDED [inaudible] BROKE UP.

THAT'S A PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP THAT INCLUDES STAKEHOLDERS FROM ALL OVER CALIFORNIA. INCLUDING THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION. ON THE OFFICE OF EDUCATION AND THE ENVIRONMENT CAL RECYCLE -- WORK COLLECTIVELY FOCUSES ON ESTABLISHING A SYSTEM OF SUPPORT FOR ENVIRONMENTAL LITERACY IN CALIFORNIA FOR OUR STUDENTS. AND IN THE TIME THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS THERE'S MORE MOMENTUM THAN EVER BEFORE THAN THAN ANY AT ANY OTHER TIME THAT WE'VE SEEN. AND SO WITH S. B. SEVEN TWENTY WOULD JUST LIKE TO KEEP THAT MOMENTUM GOING BY STRENGTHENING LEGISLATION -- GOING INTO TWENTY NINETEEN NOTICE OF THE NEW GOVERNOR SUPERINTENDENT. SO SPECIFICALLY -- JUSTIN AND IN SUMMARY SB SEVEN TWENTY INCLUDES CHANGES THAT WILL. DEEPEN EDUCATION RESOURCES AGENCIES COMMITMENT TO CALIFORNIA'S ENVIRONMENTAL PRINCIPLES AND CONCEPTS. GIVE CLEAR DIRECTION TO THE NEW STATE SUPERINTENDENT TO FACILITATE BRINGING ENVIRONMENTAL LITERACIES TO STUDENTS. AND ENCOURAGED LOCAL SCHOOL BOARDS TO BE MORE ACTIVE AND ENVIRONMENTAL LITERACY.

WHENEVER YOUNG PEOPLE ARE BEING EDUCATED ABOUT USING THE THE ENVIRONMENTAL PRINCIPLES AND CONCEPTS. AND TO FACILITATE A COLLABORATIVE PROCESS FOR REVISING THEM WHEN APPROPRIATE.

TEN FIFTEEN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AS I I JUST ALSO WANT TO START BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE FOR WORKING SO CLOSELY WITH US ON THIS MEASURE AND I'M HAPPY. TO ACCEPT THE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS DISCUSS ANALYSIS. I'M ALSO COMMITTED TO WORK CONTINUE WORKING WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS AS THIS BILL. MOVES FORWARD. I S. B. TEN FIFTEEN ESTABLISHES THE CALIFORNIA CLIMATE RESILIENCY PROGRAM AND FIND WITHIN THAT WILDLIFE CONSERVATION BOARD TO FIND PROVEN PROJECTS AT A REGIONAL LEVEL THAT WILL BE SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO PROMOTE. CLIMATE RESILIENCY AND INCREASE THE STATE'S ABILITY AND MITIGATE ADAPTS TO THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE WHILE ALSO. REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. THE THE DEBBIE SEE BE THE WILDLIFE CONSERVATION BOARD AND COASTAL CONSERVANCY HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY FUNDING AND IMPLEMENTING. PROJECTS DESIGNED TO CAPTURE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS I WHILE HELPING WITH COMMUNITIES NATURAL RESOURCES -- DOT TO THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE OVER OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS AND SO BUILDING ON THE SUCCESSFUL MODELS. WITH THIS BILL WORK TRYING TO SCALE UP THOSE TRIPS THOSE SORTS OF EFFORTS TO ENSURE THAT WE BUILD A COORDINATED AND COHESIVE STATEWIDE. PROGRAM TO GUIDE EFFORTS TO ENSURE A NATURAL RESOURCES ARE RESILIENT IN THE FACE OF CLIMATE CHANGE. THE GOVERNMENT HAS SEVERAL PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE FUNDING TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FROM WORKING AND NATURAL LANDS BUT OUR APPROACH ALLOWS GRANTING AGENCIES TO TAILOR FUNDING TO RESILIENCY PROGRAMS. AND PROJECTS THAT MEET THE NEEDS OF A GIVEN COMMUNITY OR REGION. SO THERE'S A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY HERE THE BROAD RANGE OF ACTIVITIES ALLOWED FOR IN THE BILL AND ENSURE THAT EACH REGION IN OUR STATE IN EACH COMMUNITY WILL BE ABLE TO COMPETE FOR FUNDS. EITHER THROUGH THEIR LOCAL CONSERVANCY OR IF THEY DON'T HAVE ONE THROUGH THE THAT PCB. ARE CONSERVANCY IS AS AS WE NOW HAVE FIVE QUITE A BIT OF EXPERIENCE BOTH ADDRESSING ADAPTATION RESILIENCY AND IMPORTANTLY WORKING EFFECTIVELY WITH LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO FIND EMPLOYMENT LOCAL PRIORITIES SO. IT'S OUR STRONG SENSE THAT WE SHOULDN'T WAIT TO SET UP A STATEWIDE PROGRAM FOCUSED ON NATURAL RESOURCE ADAPTATION IN THE FACE OF CLIMATE CHANGE WE'VE SEEN FIRES MUDSLIDES DROUGHTS FLOODS EXTREME HEAT LEVELS. ARE CONSERVANCY ISN'T OF THE CBO WELL.

AND SO WE REALLY DO NEED A FUNDING PROJECTS THAT BILL CLIMATE RESILIENCE FOR NATURAL SYSTEMS ARE NATURAL RESOURCES. ME TO PROTECT THESE RESOURCES AND SYSTEM SO THAT THEY IN TURN CAN PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES. OR WE'VE BEEN WITNESSING THAT THE OPPOSITE IS HAPPENING -- THANKS TO CLIMATE CHANGE. NATURE CONSERVANCY SPONSORED BILL BACK IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE BY NOW CONGRESSMAN TED LIU SET UP A PROGRAM AT THE COAST CONSERVANCY TO DO THIS TYPE OF WORK WE'VE FOUND THAT TO BE SUCCESSFUL SO FAR IN THIS REALLY BUILDS OFF OF THAT AND SCALES IT OUT TO THE REST OF THE STATE.

VERY MUCH ANY FURTHER WITNESSES A FOUR AND WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. XENA QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE MS EGGMAN THEM MISSED MCCARTY [inaudible] AND THANK YOU. SO. I GUESS MY QUESTIONS ABOUT DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY AREAS DON'T HAVE STATE CONSERVANCY'S WELL WE NEED HOW. I MEAN IT WELL BECAUSE YOU'RE SAYING IT MIGHT SO MY AREA DOESN'T HAVE A STATE CONSERVANCY RIGHT SO THAT THAT MEANS AND IT WOULD FOLLOW UNDER THAT VERY. OF DIVERSITY RIGHT SO I GUESS WHAT I'M ASKING IS HOW MANY AREAS IN THE STATE DO NOT HAVE CONSERVANCY. AND THAT THE WC BE WILL BE DOING THOSE PROGRAMS. DO THEY HAVE ENOUGH FAMILIARITY WITH ALL THE DIFFERENT DISTRICTS SOME THINK MAYBE SOME ARE WAY UP NORTHERN CALIFORNIA DOESN'T HAVE. ONE I'M THINKING MY AREA THAT TO MIX OF AG AND AND AND URBAN. DOESN'T HAVE ONE SO THOSE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT MEANS SO I'M WONDERING IF THE AGENCY THAT YOU'RE SIGNING THIS. TOO HAS A CAPACITY TO BE ABLE TO DO IT. ARE THEY GONNA HAVE STAFF UP OR THEY CAN HAVE PEOPLE ON THE GROUND OF THE ME WORKING IN COORDINATION WITH MY LOCALS. SO I GUESS MY QUESTION WHEN. I SAY HOW MANY. AREAS DON'T HAVE THEM. AND THEN WHAT I MEAN WHAT DOES THAT MEAN ABOUT CAPACITY FOR AN AGENCY. YET SO ARE CERTAINLY THEY THEY WOULD BECAUSE OF THAT ISSUE BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT NOT ALL THE STATE AND I COVERED BY IT CONSERVANCY THEY WOULD DURING A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF THE STORY I KNOW. YOU MAY KNOW IT TALKS ABOUT THIS IN ANNOUNCESON PAGE. FIVE IWC BRT HOUSE APARTMENT PLACE THAT AND THEY'RE THEY'RE SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTING PROGRAMS STATEWIDE. AUTHORED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS A GIRAFFE FUNDING. AND I'LL ON ON SIMILAR TYPES OF PROJECTS AND THAT WAS IT IS GOING TO IT AND POPULAR OUR NUMBER ONE UP EVENLY EXAMINE DO NOTHING IDEA WE WE LOOKED IN AND A LOT OF DIFFERENT OPTIONS AND AND FOUND A REALLY. MEAN IN. DEEP DISCUSSIONS OVER THAT'S RESOURCES OVER AT THE SENATE SIDE IN. FELT THAT THIS WAS THE BEST PLACE TO YOU KNOW TO HANDLE THOSE AREAS THAT WERE COVERED BY THE CONSERVANCY'S. BUT CERTAINLY IF YOU'VE GOT A SUGGESTION OFFER DIFFERENT. BEFORE FOR OR YOU KNOW ME KNOW I'M DIFFERENT MODEL THAT I'M SOMETHING ABOUT THE CAPACITY OF THE OF THE OF THE AGENCY YEAH YOU'RE YOU'RE WE'RE CITING IT A WHOLE BUNCH OF NEW THINGS. THAT DIFF DIFFERENT DISTRICTS WILL BE DEPENDENT UPON THEIR KNOWLEDGE OF THE AREA AND ABLE TO DO THE MEDICATION BEYOND THE USE THE MONEY [inaudible] I DON'T. HERE -- IF I IF I MAY JUMP IN HERE FOR JUST A MINUTE WHAT WE'VE SEEN FROM THE WILDLIFE CONSERVATION BOARD OVER THE YEARS IS THROUGH VARIOUS BOND MEASURES AND THROUGH VARIOUS PIECES OF LEGISLATION. THEY'VE BEEN GIVEN DIFFERENT PROGRAMS AND THEY'VE ADEQUATELY STAFFED UP THEY DO WORK I'M RANGING FROM THE DESERT ALL THE WAYS YOU POINT OUT ALL THE WAY UP TO THEN ORGAN BORDER -- AND HAVE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS DIFFERENT STAFF EXPERTISE TO MEET THOSE DIFFERENT RESOURCES TYPES SO WHETHER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. FORESTLANDS UP UP NEAR THE CLAIM ETHERIA OR THEIR ITS AGRICULTURAL LANDS BABY NEAR WHERE YOUR DISTRICT LIES OR WHETHER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT -- PROTECTION OUT IN THAT THE DESERT DOWN NEAR THE ARIZONA BORDER THAT THE WILDLIFE CONSERVATION BOARD HAS HISTORICALLY AND CONTINUES TO FUND PROJECTS -- AT THE GROUND LEVEL FROM ACROSS THOSE DIFFERENT AND RESOURCES TYPES AND THAT'S WHY WE'VE WE WORKING WITH THE CENTER FELT LIKE THEY WOULD BE THE MOST APPROPRIATE PLACE TO PUT THIS TYPE OF PROGRAM. I'M HERE TODAY. NOT THAT I KNOW. ALRIGHT MR MCCARTY THEN MS LIVE ON THANK YOU SENATOR I AM VERY MUCH OPEN. TO WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH AND FAMILIAR WITH THE WILDLIFECONSERVATION BOARD WE HAVE A NEW PROGRAM FOR THIS AREA. BEAUTIFUL AMERICAN WERE CONSERVANCY. ISN'T IS NOW HAS A PROGRAM. UNDER THE BOARD AND POTENTIALLY THEY COULD BE PART OF THESE EFFORTS FINA RELATES A CLIMATE RESILIENCY I DO HAVE A QUESTION FROM IN THIS IT WOULD NOT LEAD TO THE PROGRAM WHICH IS PRIORITIES AND FUNDING AND SO FORTH. SO I KNOW IT IN LA YOU HAVE OR THIS IN DOING THAT URBAN FORESTRY THAT TREAT PEOPLE THOUSAND UP. YET SO HERE IN SACRAMENTO HAVE ONE CALLED THE SACRAMENTO THREE FOUND. OKAY BEEN AROUND FOR DECADES. AND SO THEY HAVE BEEN RECEIVING RESOURCES THROUGH THE CALPERS URBAN COMMUNITY FORESTRY PROGRAM. AND QUESTION THEY HAD FOR ME LEVEL LETTER OPPOSITION. THEY HAD NONE OF THIS IS A BILL OF COURSE WE WANT THE FIGHT BUT THE FUN PIECE. IS IS THAT WE SHOULD BE DO HAVEN'T LIBERAL POSITION NO THEY DO NOT ONLY GOT ROCKET THEY DON'T NEED AND SO THEY DON'T HAVE A LETTER OUT THIS I GOT THEY ASKED ME AS A REPRESENT IT TOO YEAH. DID YOU KNOW THEY LIKE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH WITH THIS ONE I KNOW HOW WILL THIS ON HOW WILL THIS IMPACT EXISTING. PRIORITY PROGRAMS LIKE THE CAL FIRE. URBAN AND COMMUNITY FORESTRY PROGRAM. THERE FUNDING RIGHT NOW IN THE GDR AT VIA AND SO WOULD THIS BE COMPETITION OR HOW THAT ALL PLAYS OUT DOESN'T IT'S A IT'S A IT'S A SEPARATE. IT CAN STAND ALONE AREA OF THE GIRAFFE NEW. THAT WOULD FOCUS ON RESILIENCY NATURISTS OURSELVES IN AND THERE'D BE THERE'D THERE WOULD CONTINUE TO BE FINANCE FOR FOR THOSE KINDS OF PROGRAMS SO YOU'RE DOING HERE IS THERE'S LIKE WE SEEN QUITE A FEW BILLS WHICH IS TO CREATE. A UP PROGRAM WHICH SHOULD BE ELIGIBLE UNDER GIGI ARE HALF AND THEN. IN THE ANNUAL PROCESS WE WOULD HAVE TO ALLOCATE. MONIES ACCORDING EFFECTIVELY VIA NO. FAIR ENOUGH THANK YOU KNOW. MUSLIM UP TO M. MAKE COMMENTS AND I GUESS QUESTIONS WERE ALONG THAT I THINK THIS MIRRORS AND SOMETHING THAT THE SENATE RATE YOUR F. PROPOSAL IN SOME WAYS AND AS A DISTRICT THAT'S BEEN. HEAVILY IMPACTED BY WILDFIRES AYE RIGHT YOU ONLY HAVE A POT THAT SO BIG BUT IF IT'S GONNA TAKE AWAY -- FROM CAL FIRE HEALTHY FOREST FIRE PREVENTION -- AREAS -- ISSUES THAT HAVE COME THROUGH OUR COMMITTEE THAT WE'VE ALSO LET OUT I JUST I WANTED TO KNOW HOW THAT WAS GONNA INTERFACE I KNOW THAT SOME OF THE COMMON IS WELL. PROP SIXTY CAN BACK FILL BACK AT SOME POINT. IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY AT SOME POINT THE GT R. F. FUNDS STOP AND SO I THINK BACK TO WHAT WAS BEING SAID WHAT IS THE PRIORITY HOW DO WE UNDERSTAND SOME OF THIS -- AND CLEARLY YOU KNOW THEIR SUPPORT FOR THIS BOAT. YOU KNOW HOW ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT THE PRIORITY NOW THESE ARE ULTIMATELY THESE ARE BUDGET NEGOTIATION DECISIONS AND IT WILL BE A PRESUMABLY GATHERED CERTAIN POOR IF IF IT PASSES WE GET A CERTAIN PORTION OF THE G. GIRAFFE ALLOCATION AND AND BUT BUT WE ALL KNOW THERE'S GONNA BE. A LOT OF STRONG SUPPORT. FOR FOR FIRE RESULT THE PROGRAMS THAT YOU'VE BEEN DESCRIBING BECAUSE OF ALL THE CHALLENGES THAT WE'VE HAD IN AND BECAUSE OF HOW MANY MEMBERS OF AN IMPACT SO. YOU KNOW THIS IS CERTAINLY NOT INTENDED TO MEAN AND I'D I'D DIE THERE'S NO WAY THAT WILL THAT WILL. BE IT WILL -- YOU KNOW TAKE AWAY THOSE KINDS OF PROGRAMS BECAUSE THERE'S THEY'RE THEY'RE SO IMPORTANT AND THEY'RE SO THEY'RE SO POPULAR HERE IN THIS BUILDING BUT ULTIMATELY. AND THIS IS NEEDED TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH IS FUND IT WILL BE THE PRODUCT OF OUR BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS OVER THE GIRAFFE. BUT AND I KNOW THAT THIS WILL BE NEGOTIATION I GUESS THAT THE S. SOMEONE WHO KEEPS HEARING M.. ALTHOUGH WONDERFUL IDEAS THAT YOU'RE ASKING DO YOU YOU KNOW I JUST HAVE TO RAISE THE QUESTION WHO AM I WISHED. THERE WAS MORE THERE TO DO MORE BUT THAT'S YOU KNOW REALLY CAN'T BE OUR ONLY SOURCE OF THINKING ABOUT THESE THINGS BUT I AM I DO YOU KNOW WHERE YOU'RE TRYING TO GO ON A SUPPORT THAT. WE THINK YOU. BY THE WAY I MEAN THE CONSERVANCY'S IN YOUR AREA WILL CERTAINLY BE ABLE TO BENEFIT AND THERE WILL BE A FOLLOW ON IMPACT ON ON ON FIRE IS ONTO TO ASSOCIATE WITH THIS PROJECT. NO DOUBT THAT THE CONSERVANCY'S IN THAT INTEREST OF OUR AREA WILL -- ALSO BENEFIT FOR THIS I THINK THAT WHAT WE DEAL WITH AS LEGISLATORS ARE -- COMPETING. AND COMPELLING INTEREST RATE TO AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE I THINK TRYING TO GET AT ALRIGHT ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS [inaudible] THE COMMITTEE. SIR I JUST WANTED TO REINFORCE WHAT I THINK A IT'S MCCARTY AND MUSLIM ON ALSO. HAVE F. TOUCHED UPON WHICH IS THE CONCERN ABOUT [inaudible] DUPLICATION -- OR CONSOLIDATION. THESE WONDERFUL PROGRAMS THAT OTHER AID AGENCIES HAVE BEEN -- ADMINISTERING A BABY YOU'RE YOU'RE MAKING A CLEAR THAT YOUR INTENT AT LEAST THIS IS. FOR THIS TO NOT SUPPLANT ANY OTHER EFFORTS BOTH TO BE AND AND IN ADDITION -- TO AND TO COMPETE. FOR A THE ADVANTAGES ARE FUNDS. THAT'S RIGHT I MEAN OBVIOUSLY THAT YOU DRAFT IS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY -- BUT BUT THE DESERVE THESE PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP ARE ARE ARE VITALLY IMPORTANT THEY'RE POPULAR IN AND NOW I'M I AND I KNOW THAT THERE WILL BE A LOT OF I SUPPORT FOR FOR FINING THEM ROBUSTLY. I'M THIS IS JUST AT THE BENEFIT OF BUT THAT BUT THE ISSUES THAT ARE RAISED BY THIS BILL I THINK THAT DESERVE ADDRESSING AS WELL I'VE. AND AND WE'RE HOPING FOR FOR OF A PROGRAM TO HAVE IN PLACE FOR TO START WITH WITH SOME WITH SOME FUNDING AND AND AND SOME SOME PROGRAMMING -- BUT BUT THERE'S ABSOLUTE NO INTENTA TO DERAIL ANY VISA PROGRAMS OKAY ABSOLUTELY. ALRIGHT SEEING NO FURTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE WHICH LIKE CLOSE. WHAT PROJECT THE DISCUSSION CERTAINLY WOULD LOVE TO WORK WITH THE MEMBERS AND AND YOU KNOW IF IF IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS% ABOUT THE EXTENT TO WHICH DEBBIE SEABEES ABLE TO OPT TO HANDLE? ALSO IS A VERY TO THE STATE LET'S TALK ABOUT IT AND AND AND WORK ON CAPACITY BUILDING -- BUT BUT I DO THINK IT THIS IS ULTIMATELY A AND A SOLVE THAT ONE LITTLE PIECE OF THE BRIDE CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE.
