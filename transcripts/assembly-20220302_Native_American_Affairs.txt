BUT BEFORE WE START I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE LAND THAT WE'RE ON THAT ME WHAT LISTEN ON AND PART OF AN PEOPLE FROM THIS AREA SO I RECOGNIZE THEM. AND LET ME BEGIN BY THANKING THOSE OF YOU IN THE AUDIENCE- AND WATCHING ON THE ASSEMBLY TELEVISION- PAGE AS WELL AS OUR PRESENTERS THAT ARE HERE IN PERSON AND THOSE THAT WILL JOIN US ON ZOOM- YOUR TIME. AND THE SHARING OF YOUR THOUGHTS AND KNOWLEDGE TODAY. ARE ARE MOST APPRECIATED APPRECIATED BY THE SELECT COMMITTEE. AND BY THE STATE LEGISLATURE BECAUSE THE TOPICS THAT WE'RE DISCUSSING. FIRM FOR MANY TIMES THESE TYPES OF DISCUSSIONS ARE THE FIRST TIME THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY BEING HELD. HERE IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE. SO TODAY'S HEARING IS FOCUSED ON HOW THE HISTORICAL. EXPERIENCES OF NATIVE AMERICANS HAVE SHAPED THEIR ATTITUDES TOWARDS EDUCATION. AND WHAT IT MEANS FOR THE EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT- ON THE PANELS THAT WE HAVE WITH US THERE WILL BE GOING THROUGH- OUR FIRST PANEL IS THE EVOLUTION OF NATIVE AMERICANS IN EDUCATION. THE ROLE OF BOARDING SCHOOLS AND THE EFFORT TO STRIP NATIVE AMERICANS OF THEIR LANGUAGE. THE PRESENTERS ON THAT PANEL WILL BE- PROFESSOR PATRICIA DIXON- AMANDA KAY WIXEN. AND DR ROSE SO WAR SOLDIER.

PANEL THREE WILL BE CALIFORNIA INDIAN NATIONS COLLEGES WHY WE NEED OUR OWN COLLEGE TAKING BACK OUR POWER. THAT WILL BE- ON THE PANEL TO RESET MIKE CALIFORNIA INDIAN NATIONS AND CELESTE TOWNSEND THE- CALIFORNIA INDIAN NATIONS COLLEGE PRESIDENT SO THOSE WILL BE THE PANELS OF DISCUSSION AS WE MOVE FORWARD. AND IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO BE ABLE TO COME TOGETHER AND TALK ABOUT EACH ONE OF THESE PANELS IN EACH ONE OF THESE- ISSUES THAT'S SO IMPORTANT TO THE CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICAN PEOPLE- OUR PANELIST- WILL BE ABLE TO SHED SOME LIGHT. FROM THE VIEW OF THE- CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICAN PERSPECTIVE AS WELL AS HAVE INSIGHT FROM- THE LAW SCHOOL AT HASTINGS WITH THE DEAN FAGAN- PARTICIPATING IN THAT TO SHOW HOW WE'RE WORKING TOGETHER TO TRY TO. CREATE SOME SOLUTIONS TO THE HISTORY AND MANY TIMES THESE TOPICS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE TODAY- THE GENERAL PUBLIC HAS NO IDEA THAT THESE TYPES OF ATROCITIES THESE TYPES OF STRIP. OF ASSIMILATION AND CULTURE EVEN TOOK PLACE HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO THE IGNORANCE- CONTRIBUTES TO A LOT OF THE HURDLES THAT WE STILL SEE GOING ON IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN THE IN THE SCHOOL SYSTEMS IN MANY AREAS SO THIS WILL SHED A LIGHT. TO TALK ABOUT THOSE ISSUES SO THAT WE CAN TRULY MOVE FORWARD AND CORRECT- THE PAST HISTORIES INFLICTED UPON OUR PEOPLE AND I SAY OUR PEOPLE BECAUSE WE SIT HERE AS THE CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY NATIVE AMERICAN SELECT COMMITTEE AND THE ONLY CALIFORNIA INDIAN ELECTED IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE. AND THIS IS ALSO- THOSE ARE WATCHING AND THOSE IN THE AUDIENCE- OF. THE TIME FOR OTHER CALIFORNIA PEOPLE NATIVE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO RUN FOR OFFICE TO BE ABLE TO BE IN THE SEATS SO THAT WE CAN FURTHER THESE DISCUSSIONS. THAT WE'RE GONNA BE TALKING ABOUT TODAY. YOU KNOW WE CONTINUE TO. LIVE THROUGH. THE TOPICS THAT WE STILL FACE HERE TODAY AS- CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICANS. CALIFORNIA INDIAN PEOPLE- OF SERRANO GOUVEIA AND I LIVE ON THE SEMI WHY DID RESERVATIONS SO I GREW UP. WITH A LOT OF THE- STEREOTYPES THAT WERE INFLICTED UPON US IN THE EARLY. DAYS OF SCHOOL RIGHT WE HAD A DIFFERENT- CULTURAL TIMES ON THE RESERVATION. AND YET NO ONE IN THE COMMUNITY WAS WILLING TO COME AND LEARN ABOUT THE TRUE FACTUAL HISTORY OF WHO WE ARE. IN OUR AREA SURROUNDED WITH PEOPLE SO MUCH SO THAT WHEN WE WENT TO THE AREA LOCAL I. MENTERI SCHOOL. THEY HAD A DISCUSSION ON INDIAN PEOPLE AND THEY PLAYED A DRUM SONG AND- IMMEDIATELY THEY ASK WHO'S NATIVE AMERICAN WOULD YOU STAND UP WE STOOD UP. AND THEY ASKED US WHAT THAT SONG MEANT. AND WE SAID WE DON'T KNOW BECAUSE THAT'S NOT OUR CULTURE. AND IMMEDIATELY WE WERE ASKED TO SIT DOWN BECAUSE WE MUST NOT BE INDIAN ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND THAT DRUM SONG. SO THEN THAT STARTED THE WHOLE PLATE OF TRYING TO CORRECT RIGHT THE HISTORY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND ENGAGE PEOPLE TO OUR CULTURE. NOW IN SAN MARINO COUNTY THEY TRULY DO UNDERSTAND THAT WE SING TRADITIONAL CLEAVER SONGS IN BIGHORN SHEEP SONGS. WE DON'T USE THE DROP. WHAT IS THAT OPENNESS AND THAT WILLINGNESS TO LEARN FROM ONE ANOTHER WE SART TO BREAK DOWN THOSE MISCONCEPTIONS AND STEREOTYPES. SO THE ONGOING DISCUSSIONS ON THE PANELS TODAY- WILL BE HISTORIC IN BRINGING THOSE ISSUES FORWARD. AND AGAIN THIS THIS- HEARING IS RECORDED AND LIVE STREAM THROUGH THE ASSEMBLY SO A LOT OF THE TESTIMONY. AND THE WORDS THAT YOU SAY WILL BE RECORDED SO THAT WE COULD ACTUALLY GO BACK AND- RESEARCH THOSE AND ALLOW OTHERS. TO COME IN RESEARCH THE WORDS THAT WE SPOKE IN HERE TODAY- ASSEMBLYMEMBER MATHIS.

AND AS WE SAID BEFORE WHEN WE WERE WORKING ON A MONUMENT LAST YEAR. DO I NEED TO GET A LITTLE OUT OF HERE ON. I DON'T EVEN WANT THE ARMY FIX THAT FOR ME ALL THESE. IT'S GOOD TO BE HERE IN THE BEAUTIFUL WHY AND AS I WAS SAYING BEFORE FOR KAREN ROSS. TO THE UNIVERSE WITH THIS COMMUNITY TOGETHER FOR THE HOUR WORK. FORCE AT THE RIDGE. EARLY HISTORY. AND AS WE WERE SAYING LAST YEAR WE WERE PUSHING FOR A MONUMENT. TO RECOGNIZE THE TRUTH IS. YEAH THIS IS BRUTAL AND DISTURBING AS IT MAY BE. THAT IS HOW I MAKE SURE THIS NOT REPEAT ITSELF. AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO SHARE THESE STORIES YOU NEED TO BRING BACK. THESE NATIVE LANGUAGES IF YOU RESPECT- TYPE POLISH. TO OUR ANCESTORS THANK YOU ALL FOR PARTICIPATING IN AFTER GERMAN THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND DEDICATION.

SHE ALSO TAUGHT AT SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY FOR TWENTY YEARS AND HAS WORKED WITH A NUMBER OF NATIVE AMERICAN ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING SERVING ON THE SHERMAN INDIAN HIGH SCHOOL BOARD. DO WE HAVE HER READY TO GO ON THE VIRTUAL. I THINK SO. ARE YOU THERE. I'M HERE ALL RIGHT. WE GOT AUDIO AND WE GOT YOU ON SCREEN IN THE- YES I CAN SEE YOUR POINT. I USED. AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT. I'LL LET YOU SEE MY MESSY OFFICE BECAUSE I TRY SOME OF THE BACKGROUNDS I HE FELT FLOATING PICTURE OF YOUR FACE YOU KNOW WAS LIKE YOU DON'T DARE MOVE SO YOU GET TO SEE MY MESSY OFFICE. SO IT'S ONLY YOU KNOW KNOCKED ON MY I'M JUST SAYING HELLO MY NAME IS PATRICIA DIXON AND- I DO HAVE A POWER POINT- IF YOU WANT. TO SHOW IT R. I CAN JUST TALK FROM IT BECAUSE I I'M I KNOW WE HAVE LIMITED TIME. SO WHATEVER WORKS FOR YOU- CAN I SHARE MY SCREEN. DO YOU SHARE YES WE COULD TRY THAT THE POWER POINT OF IT COMES UP ON YOUR SCREEN. WELL I HIT SHARE AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO NEXT ON YOUR THING SO IT DOESN'T LIKE TELL ME WHAT. USUALLY WOULD COME UP ON THE SCREEN WHERE YOU'RE ON BUT- OKAY THEN I WILL JUST GO AHEAD AND TALK TO. I HAD A VERY LOVELY PICTURE OF WHERE I LIVE OUT IN THE FOOTHILLS OF PALMER MOUNTAIN RANGE TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF JUST SOME WHERE I COME FROM. BUT THERE ARE SEVERAL THINGS I WANTED TO DO THAT WE'RE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENED IN CALIFORNIA BUT ULTIMATELY YOU KNOW ARE ULTIMATELY. AND EVEN THOUGH I AM A PROFESSOR I DON'T WANT TO REALLY LECTURE LECTURES SO I AM GOING TO JUST TRY TO HIGHLIGHT IT FOR YOU IF I CAN. AND WE TODAY ARE THE BENEFICIARIES OF- FOR THE LOT A LACK OF BETTER WORDS SOMETHING CALLED THE DOCTRINE OF DISCOVERY. AND THE DOCTOR DISCOVERY WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS CREATED IN THE LATE FOURTEEN HUNDREDS. TO BASICALLY SOLIDIFIED THE RIGHT OF EUROPEANS AND THE CATHOLIC CHURCH AT THAT POINT IN TIME TO LAY CLAIM TO WHAT WAS ON. THE DISCOVER IT LANDS IN THE AMERICAS. AND THE ONLY WAY THAT THOSE EUROPEAN POWERS WHICH WERE ORIGINALLY SPAIN AND PORTUGAL COULD. EXERCISE DOMINION WOULD BE TO ALSO GET WHAT ARE CALLED THE GIFTS AND IN QUOTATION MARKS OF CONVERSION IN CIVILIZATION. AND IT WAS- THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE YOU DO THAT. THE COOKIES THE DOORS DOWN DID NOT ENGAGE IN THAT RESPONSIBILITY QUICKLY BECAUSE THEIR GOAL WAS. TO LAY CLAIM TO THE LAND INTO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ITS RESOURCES AND THE PEOPLE THAT LIVED IN IT OFTENTIMES YOU- WARFARE- AND CRUELTY. BUT EVENTUALLY THEY'RE INDIVIDUALS WHO WHO. DEMANDED THAT THEY. DO IT BECAUSE THEY THEY HAD TO STAND BEFORE OD AT ONCE THE ONE PARTICULAR DAY. SO THE PRINCIPLES OF THAT DOCTOR BASICALLY WAS A LEGAL AND MORAL JUSTIFICATION BUT ALLOW THE PRESENCE OF EUROPEANS IN THAT. IN THE UNDISCOVERED AMERICA'S AT THAT POINT TIME. AND WHAT IS INTERESTING IS THAT THE OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES WILL JOIN A HUNDRED YEARS LATER I WILL CHOOSE TO FOLLOW THOSE PRINCIPLES IT'S NOT A LAW BUT THEIR PRINCIPLES. AND THEY ARE MORE INTERESTED IN SECURING THE RIGHT TO THE AMERICAS AGAINST EACH OTHER. AND THERE IS AN IMPLICIT RECOGNITION AS THE INDIANS WERE THERE FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT THEY WERE PHYSICALLY THERE YOU HAD TO COUNT FOR WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND HOW YOU'RE DOING IT. SO THERE THE RECOGNITION OF THEIR LACK RIGHT TO THE LAND WAS PRESENT BUT IS INFERIOR BECAUSE THEY WERE CHRISTIAN. AND BECAUSE HE ALSO DIDN'T HAVE THE GOOD SENSE TO DEVELOP THE LAND LIKE IT SHOULD BE LET SHOULD BE DEVELOPED ACCORDING TO EUROPEAN IDEAS. AND THERE WAS A VERY BLATANT- IGNORING OF THE FACT OF OTHER PARTS OF THE AMERICAS THAT HAD VERY ELABORATE CIVILIZATION IS AN AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT. IF THE NATIVES REFUSED YES OF CONVERSION AND CIVILIZATION. IT WOULD ALLOW FOR WARFARE END OF THE CALL JUST WARFARE. BECAUSE OF THE TYPE OF HISTORY WITH PEOPLE. FEARED FOR THEIR SOULS AND TO ENGAGE IN ON JUST WAR WOULD BE TO SUFFER YOUR REST OF YOUR LIFE AFTER DEATH IN A IN A HELL. THERE WAS ALSO A VERY SMALL PART IN THAT DOCTOR DISCOVERY THAT- SAID IF. THE CONVERSION OF CIVILIZATION WENT WELL. THEN OF COURSE IS THE LAND THAT BELONGED TO THE INDIANS ORIGINALLY WAS STILL RE RE BEING RETAINED BY THEM. BUT THERE WAS THIS BELIEF THAT CONVERSION OF CIVILIZATION WOULD BE DONE SO WELL THAT THEY SIMPLY BECOME A PROBLEM. AND BE A PART OF THE SYSTEM USUALLY AS A P. ON IF YOU WILL GET AS A VERY SIMPLE FARMER AND THEN THEY WOULD SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE- OF THE CIVILIZATION THAT THE ESTABLISHED. WHILE THIS WAS BEING DECIDED- AND SLOWLY IMPLEMENTED THERE'S TWO MEN AND ONE WAS A MAN CALLED BARTOLOME DE LAS CASAS. HE WAS A SPANIARD WHO BECAME A DOMINICAN PRIEST LATER IN LIFE AND THEN ONCE THEY PULL THE WHO IS ALSO A SPANIARD AND ISSUE A LITTLE AND NOT A THEOLOGIAN SURPRISING ENOUGH HE'S A LAYMEN WHO DID STUDY THEOLOGY. AS THERE WAS A DISCUSSION. ALL BETWEEN THE RELIGIOUS AUTHORITIES THE CHURCH AND THE EUROPEAN MONARCHS. THE INDIANS HAVE SOULS. BECAUSE IF THEY HAVE SOULS WE CAN'T LEAVE THEM. IN FIFTEEN TWENTY YEARS EARLIER THERE WAS A DECISION MADE THAT PEOPLES OF AFRICA DO NOT HAVE SOULS THERE FOR JUSTIFICATION WAS ALLOW FOR THERE IS LATE. SO THEY HAD A BIG DEBATE IN A TOWN IN SPAIN. AND THERE WAS NO CLEAR WIN FROM A LEGAL PERSPECTIVE- ON. THOSE CLASSES SAID THE NATIVES HAD INDIGENOUS RIGHT TO THEIR LANDS AND TO BE TREATED AS FULLY CAPABLE HUMAN BEINGS. AND THAT THE ACTIONS OF THE CONQUISTADORS WERE ON CALL FOR UNJUSTIFIED. AWESOME SUPPORTERS SAID THAT THEY DID NOT HAVE SOULS AND THEY ARE HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE SAFE BUT THEY HAD BE TREATED WELL AS SLAVES. AND THE OUTCOME OF THAT DEBATE WAS I'M NOT A CLEAR WIN. ALL ACROSS THIS ONE FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE FACT THAT THEY BELIEVE THE INDIA'S COULD NOT BE ENSLAVED THAT THEY DID IN FACT HAVE SOULS. BUT SIMPLE WITH THE SET ALSO PROVED TO THEM THAT THE INDIANS WERE LIKE CHILDREN. HE DID NOT KNOW HOW TO UTILIZE OUR RESOURCES ARE THEIR LANDS AND THEY NEED TO BE TAUGHT HOW TO BE CIVILIZED PEOPLE. DO THE CONVERSION PROCESS AS WELL. SO THAT THE ROLE OF THE CHURCH AND THE STATE WOULD BE TO BE THEIR PARENTS. AS THOUGH THEY WERE CHILDREN AND THEY HAVE THE RIGHT THEN TO TAKE OVER THE PROPERTY NEAR RESOURCES FOR THEIR BENEFIT DEVELOP A SERIES OF. METHODS TO DO THE CONVERSION IS CIVILIZATION IN US ARE WE IN CALIFORNIA. WE WILL FALL UNDERNEATH THE LAST OF THREE HUNDRED YEARS OF EXPERIMENTATION CALL THE MISSION PROCEEDING- PUBLIC COMPLEX MISSIONS WERE CREATED TO GIVE THE STORY OF RELIGION. AND THEN TO GET THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE CAUGHT THE PRESIDIO WAS FOR IT THAT WOULD GIVE GLORY TO THE STATE AND THE PUBLIC VIEW THAT HOME WHICH WOULD BE THE BENEFIT OF THESE CONVERTERS CIVILIZED INDIA'S. THAT'S WHAT YOU SEE IN FLORIDA PARTS OF THE SOUTHWEST AND IN CALIFORNIA. YEAH SINCE WHICH TO THEENGLISH SIDE VERY QUICKLY BECAUSE THEY- WILL CHOOSE TO FOLLOW CONVERGENCE OF ALLIES WAS ALWAYS QUESTIONABLE DUCATION CALIFORNIA. V. BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT MONOLITHIC MEDIAN ALL CATHOLIC COUNTRIES IN EUROPE AND ENGLAND WAS SPLIT BETWEEN- THE PURITAN MOVEMENT SPLIT BETWEEN THE REF- THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND THE REMNANTS OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH THAT WAS TRYING TO SURVIVE THERE. THERE IS SO EACH OF THE COMPANIES WILL HAVE A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT TAKE ON IT BECAUSE OF WHATEVER THE RELATIONSHIP IS TO THE PARTICULAR PROTESTANT VERSION THAT THEY BELIEVE YEAH. BUT WHAT IS INTERESTING IS THE- THOSE WHO AT THE NEW ENGLAND AREA. THEY WILL IMPACT QUICKLY UPON THE TRIBAL PEOPLES THERE THIS ONE IN PARTICULAR WHO'S REALLY FAMOUS HE'S FROM THE MOHEGAN TRIBE HIS NAME WAS SAMPSON WELCOME. AND HE WILL CHOOSE TO CONVERT TO PRESBYTERIANISM HE'LL GO TO A SCHOOL ESTABLISHED BY THE CHURCH THERE BECOME AN ORDAINED PRESBYTERIAN MINISTER ALL BECOME AN EXCELLENT- BE A LOADED AS SCHOLAR OF THE BIBLE HE WILL HE WILL WRITE PARTS OF THE BIBLE IN HIS NATIVE LANGUAGE HE WILL ON. PREACH THE GOODNESS OF CHRISTIANITY. AND THEN HE SLOWLY LEARNS THAT IF HE ALTHOUGH HE HAS OPTED TO BECOME CIVILIZED AND CONVERTED. O ENGLISH PERSPECTIVES. THAT HE IS NOT ONE OF THEM HE IS NOT REALLY AS CHILD A SON OF GOD THAT HE IS SOMEONE WHO IS. ON THE VERY SECONDARY IN INCONSEQUENTIAL. AND HE- WANTS TO CONTINUE TO BELIEVE IN THE GOODNESS OF THE CHRISTIAN GOD BUT HE CONDEMNS. THAT PRACTICES OF CHRISTIANITY BY HIS FELLOW CHRISTIAN MINISTERS AND THEIR CONGREGATIONS AND HE WILL MOVE WITH HIS PEOPLE IN OTHER INDIANS TO CREATE A FREE TOWN WHERE THEY CAN PRACTICE CHRISTIAN PRINCIPLES BUT ALSO CONVERT TO OUR LAND TO RETURN TO THEIR TRADITIONAL WAYS OF. COMMON LAND HOLDING FOR EXAMPLE OF COMMUNAL SHARING IS. AND SO YOU HAVE TO HELP ME WITH THAT ENGLISH. THEIR CONVERGENCE OF ALLIES IS TO GO OUT AND SELECT KEEP PEOPLE. AMONG THE OF. LEADERSHIP OF THE TRIBES TO COVER CIVILIZE THEM AND TO BRING BACK THEIR ELEMENTS OF CHRISTIANITY BUT THEY HAD ALSO THINK THEY WERE WORTHY YET BECAUSE WE ALSO HAVE THE FAMOUS LANGUAGE OF THE INDIANS WERE THE- HISPANA SATAN THAT COMES FROM SOME OF THE PURITAN METHOD. LEADERS AS WELL. SO THERE'S BEEN A VERY SO WHERE DO WE GET THIS I DO NEED TO CONVERT THE CIVILIZED INDIANS EDUCATE INDIA'S IS IT IS GOING TO COME FROM THE DOCTOR DISCOVERY. IS GOING TO COME THIS IDEA THAT WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO JUSTIFY BEFORE THE EYES OF GOD. THAT WE HAVE A RIGHT TO BE HERE AND BECAUSE- WE ARE HERE. WILL BRING THESE ISSUES TO THE POINT WHERE WE ARE SO FAR AHEAD OF THEM IN CIVILIZATION CAN BRING THEM. MORE FURRY ROCKS- DISEASE TAKES ITS TOLL. EVENTUALLY WE HAVE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE BOARDING SCHOOLS. NOW BOARDING SCHOOLS AS WE UNDERSTAND THEM TODAY DIDN'T EXIST PRIOR TO THEIR ACTUAL ESTABLISHMENT BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE FOREMOST ALBERTA BOARDING SCHOOLS UNDER THE FEDERAL SYSTEM. A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THAT- SOME OF THE IVY LEAGUE SCHOOLS ON THE EAST COAST HARBOR IS ONE EXAMPLE. HAS PART OF THEIR CHARTER TO YOU KNOW CONVERT IN TO EDUCATE INDIA AND SEND THE DISSEMINATE RIGHT AND ONE OF THE EARLIEST AUDITORIUMS IS OF THEIR GRADUATE DO YOU FEEL THE OLOGY SCHOOL STUDENTS WOULD BE AMERICA WOULD BE AN AMERICAN INDIAN I THINK FROM. MARTHA'S VINEYARD IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY. BUT WHAT WE'RE ABOUT HERE TODAY IS VERY UNIVERSAL APPROACH TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO. BRING INDIANS TO THE POINT OF CONVERSION IN CIVILIZATION AT THIS POINT TIME OUR COUNTRY IS PRIMARILY WHITE ABLE SAXON PROTESTANT. SO THE VERSIONS OF CHRISTIANITY FOR US ARE GOING TO BE PROSTITUTES AND FOR A VERY BRIEF PERIOD OF TIME- CHURCHES COULD ACTUALLY PETITION IT BECOME FEDERAL BOARDING SCHOOLS BUT THERE WAS A WILD CRAZY OUTCRY AGAINST THIS THE MIXING OF CHURCH AND STATE SO THEY SEPARATED IT. BUT THE PRINCIPLES THE TENNIS OF PROTESTANT CHRISTIANITY WERE VERY FOUNDATIONAL TO THE RUNNING OF THE SCHOOLS. AND THE VERY SIMPLE PURPOSE IS TO CONVERT SYMBOLIZES INDIA'S TURN AMERICAN WAY OF LIFE. A CAPTAIN CRACKED IS GIVEN AND- RECOGNITION AS BEING THE ORIGINAL FOUNDER OF THE SPECIAL BOARDING SCHOOL SYSTEM THE START AT CARLISLE INDIAN SCHOOL. AND HIS FAMOUS QUOTE IS THAT YOU SAVE THE U. YOU SAVE THE MAN KILLING THE INDIA AND SO HE'LL MOVE AHEAD WITH THAT. CONFORMITY IS ON REQUIRED IN THE BOARDING SCHOOLS AND THAT THE HORRIBLE THINGS THAT HAPPENED WERE WERE VERY TRUE PUBLIC BEATINGS FOR SPEAKING THE TRIBAL LANGUAGES- MOCHRIE AND- OF THEIR WAYS OF LIFE HOW THEY LIVE HOW THEY WORK TO HELP THE HOUSES THEY LIVED IN. AND OF COURSE YOU'VE GOT THE HAIR CUT THEY HAD TO WEAR UNIFORMS. DISLOCATION FROM THEIR HOMES- OF FORCIBLE REMOVAL FROM THEIR HOMES. SOMETIMES WHEN THEY DISCOVER THAT THEY LIVE TOO CLOSE TO THE TRADITIONAL HOMELANDS THEY KNEW THEY HAD TO THEN TAKE CHILDREN FAR AWAY AND THEY DID SOMETIMES A THOUSAND MILES AWAY THEORETICALLY STUDENTS COULD GO HOME BUT THEY HAD TO GET PERMISSION TO DO IT. PARENTS CAN SHOW UP IN THE COMPLIANCE THE KIDS WEREN'T THERE. OF SOMERS THEY CAN GO HOME OF THE ONE OF THE CULT AUDIENCE IN THESE OUTINGS WOULD LIVE WITH FAMILIES THAT WOULD TEACH THEM YOU KNOW THE BENEFITS OF RUNNING IT A PERFECT. WHITE HOUSEHOLD. SO THAT THAT BUT. INDIA'S RESISTED. OUR CHILDREN RESISTANCE AND IF YOU THINK OF YOUR OWN CHILDREN AT HOME HOW OFTEN DO THEY FIND A WAY TO GET AROUND YOUR RULES I REMEMBER MY FATHER TELLING. YOU THAT- I COULD NOT- WEAR MAKE UP EIGHTH GRADE AND I WAS GOING TO THE MISSION SCHOOL A DAY SCHOOL AND NOW. SO I FIGURED OUT YOU KNOW WELL ALL THE STATEMENTS OF BERRIES AND I'LL GET THE CHARCOAL MIX IT WITH A LITTLE BIT OF WAX AND- YOU KNOW PUT MASCARA ON MY EYEBROWS AND- EYES AND A DAD I DID NOT USE ANY MAKE UP I USE THE NATURAL PRODUCTS OF LIFE. SO YOU KNOW HIS KIDS FIND WAYS TO GET AROUND THE RULES IN THE INDIAN KIDS DID IT- THEY SLOW DOWN THEIR PROGRESS DELIBERATELY. THE CLASS LATE TURN IN ASSIGNMENTS LATE. ONE AWAY WHICH OFTEN TIMES HAD TRAGIC CONSEQUENCES. ON THE LINE SINCE WITH EACH OTHER. PROTECTIVE VALUE THE MOST WEEK- TRIBES THAT WERE FORMER ENEMIES THEY LEARN TO OVERCOME THEIR DIFFERENCES TO A CERTAIN DEGREE CREATE A PAN INDIAN ISM. I TELL MY STUDENTS THAT THE IRONY OF THE BOARDING SCHOOL WHICH WAS INTENDED TO WIPE OUT TRIBAL IDENTITY. AND TO DIMINISH THE CONNECTION TO HOME AND HOMELANDS INDIAN BOARDING SCHOOL WASN'T INTENDED BUT THE INDIAN BOARDING SCHOOLS BECAME LIKE THE ELITE BOARDING SCHOOLS OF EUROPE AND AMERICA. IT'S ONLY THE BEST OF THE BEST LOOK TO THOSE SCHOOLS THEY CREATED THEIR ALLIANCES THEIR MARRIAGES THEY SHARE THEIR POWER AND THEIR RESOURCES THEY CREATED COMMUNICATION NETWORK AND PUT THE STRESS ON COMMUNICATION AND NETWORK. THESE INDIAN KIDS LEFT THE BOARDING SCHOOLS AND THOSE WHO WENT HOME AND WERE SIXTH IN ALL WERE ABLE TO RE ESTABLISH THE RELATIONSHIPS THEY CREATED A NETWORK. EVENT NETWORK HULU TOGETHER SO NO MATTER WHAT OUR TRIBAL DIFFERENCES. WE CAN FORM ALLIANCES AND RELATIONSHIPS THAT WILL CARRY US THROUGH THE WORST OF WHATEVER THE AMERICANS HAVE TO GIVE TO US WASN'T EXPECTED TO STRENGTHEN THE ROOTS OF THE TRIBAL PEOPLES. CREATED TRIBAL IDENTITIES WHERE YOU WERE NOT JUST ONE TRIBE MAYBE SEVERAL OF MY GRANDPARENTS MET SHERMAN INDIAN HIGH SCHOOL DIFFERENT TRIBES CAME TOGETHER. ON EXPECTED THAT THERE'S SO MUCH LITERATURE ON THE HORSE A BOARDING SCHOOL THAT ARM. YEAH YOU NEED TO READ IT YOU CAN. THE DOWNSIDE SO BUT YOU KNOW BESIDES WONDERFUL BEING ABANDONED USE THE DOWNSIDE IS THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE GOOD ROLE MODELS AMONG ADULTS. SO IT MADE IT DIFFICULT WHEN THEY BECAME ADULTS HOW TO BECOME A FAMILY IN THAT RESPECT OTHER RAISE YOUR CHILDREN IN THAT RESPECT. OF THOSE VERY EARLY YEARS SOME OF THEM YOU KNOW EXPERIENCED ACTUAL WARFARE THEY SAW THE TRAUMA OF HAVING PEOPLE. GUIDED BEFORE THEIR EYEBALLS ON. SO THAT TAT DOES DOES DOWNSIZE THAT ARE VERY VERY REAL. IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES. THE KENNEDY ADMINISTRATION DID A STUDY. OF YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON IN OUR FEDERAL INDIAN BOARDING SCHOOLS IN INDIAN COUNTRY IN GENERAL AND THEY ALSO HAD A STUDY OF EDUCATION. AND THAT DOES THAT STUDY SAID WE NEED TO CLOSE THESE BODIES CLOSED OUT NOW. BECAUSE THE BOYS BECAUSE IT HAPPENED ACTUALLY MUCH EARLIER THE IDEA BUT THE LIMITATION HAS NOT REALLY TAKEN PLACE. AND THOSE FORTY SCHOOLS A STATE EXISTENCE THE CURRICULUM HAD TO GO THROUGH A RADICAL REVISION. AND THAT'S HOW JUNIOR SHERMAN STARTED ON THE GENERATION AHEAD OF ME THEY FOUGHT THE BATTLE THEY GOT THEY GOT WHO WOULD YOU LIKE TO DO THIS TO REPRESENT THE SOUTHERN TRIBES IN CALIFORNIA AND I HAPPENED AND I WAS SELECTED NICE I BECAME ONE OF THE THREE CALIFORNIA INDIANS WHO THEN REPRESENTED. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN THE SHERMAN ARE INDIAN SCHOOL BOARD. AND THEN THE REMAINING CANDIDATES ON THE SCHOOL BOARD FOR THE MOST POPULAR OF ALL OF. THE LARGEST TRIBES AT THE SCHOOL SO WE HAD NOW TO HOLD APACHES. UP HE WAS- TO NAME SOME OF THE TRIBES THAT WERE THERE AND WE WORK TOGETHER TO REVIEW THE CURRICULUM TO INTRODUCE NEW CURRICULUM. AND TO TRY TO IMPLEMENT THE RIGHTS OF THE CHILDREN IN THE RIGHTS OF THE TRIBES WITH THE SCHOOL BOARD. AND IT WAS ROCKY BECAUSE AT FIRST THE FORMER SCHOOL BOARD WHERE THEY WERE. SOMEWHAT IN EXISTENCE MORE LIKE RUBBER STAMPS. ALL ALL PROBLEM. THIS IS THE PERSONAL OPINION A PROBLEM WITHIN THE FEDERAL SYSTEM IS THAT OUT. OF WHAT CAN BE TEN YOU KNOW SHORT OF LIKE DO SOME EGREGIOUS OFFENSE OF HORRIBLE CRYING YOU CONSPIRACY THERE FOREVER AND DO YOUR JOB- SO THAT GETTING PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS THE SCHOOLS WITH THE HOMES OF THE KIDS. AT ALL WAS TO MAKE THE MEN'S NOT JUST GOOD CITIZENS GOOD TRAVEL SO SINCE AND GOOD PEOPLE SKILLS AND ABILITIES TO TRANSFER ON THE CALL AGENTS TO DO WHATEVER IS NEEDED FOR THEIR TRIBE. THAT IS BASICALLY WE GOTTA GET UP TO SCHOOL. AND WHATEVER WILL MAKE IT WORK WILL WORK. WE HAD ONE INDIVIDUAL WHO. ALL WOULDN'T TÍNH THE SUBSTITUTE. OF SPORTS AND ON PHYSICAL EDUCATION OR ENGLISH CREDITS. BECAUSE ALL THEY HAD TO DO WAS SHOW THE NUMBER OF CREDITS THAT THEY DID YOU GRADUATE THAT KIND OF THING SO THE FOCUS IS A GREEN CREDIT OF ACCRUING CRESTING GRADUATE BUT NOT NECESSARILY FEELS THAT WOULD MAKE YOU- A WELL EDUCATED PERSON. CRICKET THE CAMPUSES ARE NOT WELL KEPT UP BUT THAT'S IRONY OF IT. AND THIS IS THE- AS IN PART IS THAT. THE KIDS OF THE MID TO LATE TWENTIETH CENTURY LIKE THE KIDS FROM A HUNDRED YEARS EARLIER. THEY TOOK WHAT THE SCHOOL HAD TO MAKE IT WORK FOR THEM. AND I GUESS MY STORY HERE FOR YOU IS NOT TO DWELL ON THE HOLDERS OF THE BOARDING SCHOOLS NOT TO DWELL ON WHAT IT TOOK AWAY SO MUCH AS TO SHOW HOW OBEY ME THE CHILDREN THEMSELVES GAINED IT BACK IT'S NOT IT WASN'T A PERFECT SYSTEM THERE'S STILL WERE PROBLEMS THERE- BUT- IT'S CHAU THE INADEQUACIES ALSO. AND THAT AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU SO TO SUM IT UP BECAUSE I THINK MY FIFTEEN MINUTES OF. HAVE EXCEEDED. YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE DOCTOR DISCOVERY WITH THIS FUNDAMENTAL BELIEF IT HAD A RIGHT TO THE LAND. THE ONLY WAY TO JUSTIFY FOR THE EYES OF BEFORE THE EYES OF A BOD ARE THE STATE ITSELF WE'RE TWO DIFFERENT EUROPEAN NATIONS FOUGHT AMONGST THEMSELVES OVER WHOSE CONVERSION TO WHOSE GOD WHO CIVILIZATION. AND THEN THAT WOULD JUSTIFY THE TAKING OF THE LAND AND THE DESTRUCTION OF THE PEOPLE IN THIS VALUES. BECAUSE THEY WOULD BECOME LIKE THEM BUT THE RD IS THAT EVEN WHEN THEY ATTEMPT TO DO THAT THE INDIANS SAM'S IN OAKLAND BEING ONE PERSON AS AN EXAMPLE. THEY ARE NOT SUFFICIENT IN THE EYES OF THOSE WHO TOOK THE LAND. IN MY EXPERIENCE IT'S GERMAN WAS THAT. THE KIDS WERE GOING TO MAKE IT WORK DESPITE THE SYSTEM ITSELF. BUT EVEN WITH THEIR- EFFORTS IN WITH AN INDIAN SCHOOL BOARD. IT WAS DIFFICULT TO FIGHT THAT INGRAINED BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE INFERIOR PEOPLE WILL HELP YOU WITH WHAT YOU NEED TO MAKE IN THE WORLD BUT NOT TO BE AN EQUAL AT OUR TABLE. THANK YU. THANK YOU I'M A PROFESSOR DIXON- FOR THOSE SOME EDUCATIONAL AND INSIGHTFUL WORDS ARE COMING FROM- CALIFORNIANS PERSON A STEAM DOES YOURSELF FROM PALMA INDIAN RESERVATION- I WANNA WELCOME ASSEMBLY MEMBERS- WENDY CARILLO AND ASSEMBLY MEMBERS ARE LOOKING ARAMBULA FOR JOINING US AS WE- CONTINUE WITH OUR FIRST PANEL.

CAN IS IT WORKING YES GOOD OKAY- I'M HERE FOR LEARNING CISCO THE CALL FOR LEADER AND ME DIRECTOR SHERMAN INDIAN HIGH SCHOOL AND I KNOW SHE VERY MUCH WANTED TO BE HERE TODAY BUT COULDN'T SO I JUST WANTED TO MENTION FOR- SO. WE CAN BEGIN- THE FOR THREE YEARS THE DOMINANT EUROPEAN AMERICAN SOCIETY AND STRUGGLE TO FIND A SOLUTION TO THEIR INDIAN PROBLEM. DESPITE DEVASTATING POPULATION DECLINES DUE TO DISEASE WAR REMOVAL NATIVE PEOPLES PERSISTENT. DURING THE PROGRESSIVE ERA EUROPEAN AMERICANS OF THE DOMINANT SOCIETY DECIDED THE INDIANS MUST ASSIMILATE ENJOINED QUOTE CIVILIZED SOCIETY. BY TARGETING NATIVE YOUTH AND REMOVING THEM FROM THEIR COMMUNITIES TO OFFERS OF RUSSIAN INSTITUTIONS THE NON NATIVE PUBLIC HOPE TO A RACE NATIVE IDENTITY AND REPLACE IT WITH THE CONCEPT OF THE IDEAL INDIAN. EXIDE PLEASE- ALL READ THAT OUT I GUESS OF THE HISTORY OF INDIAN BOARDING SCHOOLS AS DOCTOR DIXON MENTIONED- SORT BEGAN IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY WITH THE JESUIT MISSIONARIES WE'RE KIND OF THE PRECURSORS TO THE BOARDING SCHOOLS UNTIL NINETEEN SEVENTY MANY MISSIONS WILL DIRECTLY SUBSIDIZED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. ROSE WILL SYSTEM WAS ESTABLISHED IN THE EIGHTEEN SIXTIES AND WE'VE HEARD THE HEARD OF ARMY OFFICER RICHARD HENRY PRATT WHO WAS INSPIRED BY HIS EXPERIENCE WITH INDIAN PRISONERS IN FORT MARION FLORIDA- HE BELIEVE THE TRUE ASSIMILATION FOR INDIANS WOULD ONLY COME BY KILLING WHAT WAS INDIAN. WITHIN A MAN TO SAVE HIM. HE SUCCESSFULLY ADVOCATED FOR FEDERAL POSITION BOARDING SCHOOL FACILITY TO BE THROUGH ISOLATION EDUCATION AND LABOR. THE FIRST FRONT OFFERED UP RESERVATION FOR JUST ONE CARLISLE WAS ESTABLISHED IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY NINE. AND THEIR PRATT AIM TO PHYSICALLY IDEOLOGICALLY AND EMOTIONALLY REMOVE INDIAN CHILDREN FROM THEIR FAMILIES HOMES AND TRIBAL AFFILIATIONS. AT SCHOOL THEY COULD NOT BE INDIAN IN ANYWAY CULTURALLY ARTISTICALLY SPIRITUALLY OR LINGUISTICALLY. AND THIS WAY CARLISLE AND OTHER INDIAN BOARDING SCHOOLS WERE KEY COMPONENTS IN THE PROCESS OF CULTURAL GENOCIDE AGAINST NATIVE CULTURES. IN THE FOLLOWING TWO DECADES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ESTABLISHED AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY FOUR INDIAN OFFERS A VISION BOARDING SCHOOLS. AND I PUT THE SLIDE UP HERE THIS COMES FROM OUR OWN STATUTES OF CALIFORNIA BELIEVE IN NINETEEN OH NINE. THERE IS IN THIS CONTEXT THAT SHERMAN WAS ESTABLISHED THIS IDEA OF EXCLUSION. THAT CHILDREN COULD BE SEPARATED FOR VICIOUS VICIOUS AND FILTHY BEHAVIORS. BECAUSE THEY WERE DIRTY. AND BECAUSE THEY WERE IN. AND I THINK THAT'S THE SIMPLE THING TO SEE IN WRITING YOU KNOW THAT THE STATUS OF CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY HAVE THIS KIND OF GARBAGE AT THE TIME. SO NINETEEN OH ONE. CAN YOU PUT THE NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. IN NINETEEN OH ONE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ESTABLISHED THE LAST OF THE BOARDING SCHOOLS IN RIVERSIDE I NINETEEN OH TWO EIGHTEEN PM A STUDENTS WERE ENROLLED WITH A HANDFUL OF MISSION INDIANS ROOM INCREASED YEAR BY YEAR AND BY NINETEEN A WEEK SHERMAN HOUSE FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY STUDENTS. EVOKING THE MISSIONARY OF THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE SCHOOL SITE ENCOURAGED A ROMANTICIZED VERSION OF CALIFORNIA HISTORY ONE THAT DID NOT REFERENCE THE LOSSES OF NATIVE PEOPLE UNDER THE SPANISH FATHERS IN HERE PUT A QUOTE FROM. CHARLES LEWIS. ACTUALLY FOUNDER OF THE SOUTHWEST MUSEUM WHOSE EARLY CALIFORNIA PROMOTER AND FRIEND OF FRANK MILLER WHO WAS ALSO A RIVERSIDE PROMOTER. AND IT SAYS I CAN'T REALLY READ IT FROM HER- BUT IT TALKS ABOUT HOW KIND OF- IT FOR MOST SHERMAN AS A TOURIST DESTINATION FOR MILLER ALSO ON THE STREETCAR AND STREAKER ENDED RIGHT IN FRONT OF SHERMAN SO YOU COULD GO SPEND THE DAY LOOKING AT INDIANS AND HE ADVERTISES HERE. WHAT A BETTER WAY THAT TO SEE INDIANS IT'S SO CHEAP THERE SO CLOSE HERE THEY ARE TEAMED AND DOMICILE SO THIS IS AN OPEN ADVERTISEMENT FOR PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER CALIFORNIA TO GO LOOK AT INDIA'S KIND ON THEIR MARCH TO CIVILIZATION. A COULD YOU THE DANCE IS LIKE. SIX SHERMAN MINISTRATION FILL THE STUDENTS DAILY LIVES WITH WORK AND ACTIVITIES THE CURRICULUM INCLUDED A BASIC LEVEL OF ACADEMIC LEARNING ARITHMETIC HISTORY GEOGRAPHY SPELLING AND READING HOWEVER THE VOCATIONAL TRAINING PROGRAMS CONSUME MOST OF THE STUDENTS TIME FLOOR HISTORIES WE KNOW NOW EVEN THOUGH OSTENSIBLY THEY WERE SPLIT HALF DAY HALF ACADEMIC HALF OCCASIONAL REALLY WASN'T THE CASE IT WAS MORE LIKE AN HOUR TO TWO HOURS OF RUDIMENTARY. RUDIMENTARY ACADEMICS AND THE REST WAS WORK FROM FIVE IN THE MORNING TO TEN PM CHILDREN AS YOUNG AS FOUR YEARS OLD WORKED.

SPORTS ALSO PLAYED A LARGE PART OF THE SMOKE SCHOOL PROGRAM WITH SPORTS TEAMS REGULARLY COMPETING AGAINST AREA SCHOOLS. A SCHOOL OFFICIALS AND REPRESENTATIVES OF THE OFFICE OF INDIAN AFFAIRS LAID THE CORNERSTONE OF SHERMAN INSTITUTE IN NINETEEN OH ONE LIKE I MENTIONED. AND THE EVENT LIKE I SAID GROUP- DREW OVER SEVEN THOUSAND SPECTATORS OF THIS KIND OF SPECTACLE CARRIED ON THROUGH THE EARLY HISTORY OF SHERMAN. EVERY SUNDAY THEY WOULD FIGHT THE COMMUNITY THE RIVERSIDE COMMUNITY WOULD COME TO WATCH THIS. REAL AND OFTEN SEEN FROM NEWS ON NEWS COVERAGE THAT THEY ACTUALLY. TOLD THE NON NATIVE AUDIENCE THEY NEED TO NOT BE SO ROWDY AND TO CALM DOWN BECAUSE THEY WERE ACTUALLY THE ONES THAT WERE KIND OF OUT OF CONTROL IN THESE LITTLE PUBLIC DISPLAYS. COULD YOU. FOR THE NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO SHERMAN. ALSO LIEBHARD OUTSIDE OF THE SCHOOL AS PART OF THE CONTROVERSIAL OUTING PROGRAM LOCAL LIKE CHRISTIAN FAMILIES HIRED SHERMAN STUDENTS FOR VARYING LENGTHS OF TIME SOMETIMES YEAR ROUND TO PERFORM VARIOUS TASKS. CHORES AND OTHER KINDS OF MANUAL WORK. FOR SHERMAN STUDENTS THE PRICE OF CIVILIZATION. STEEP BOYS WORKING IN THE GROWTH OF RIVERSIDE OFTEN LIVED IN POOR HOUSES AND WORKED IN DANGEROUS CONDITIONS. ALL GIRLS UNDER TO FORM OF CULTURAL ISOLATION IN THE HOMES OF LOCAL WHITE FAMILIES. LIVING AND WORKING WITHOUT THE COMPANY OF OTHER STUDENTS. AND I THINK IT'S A GOOD TIME TO MENTION THIS KIND OF STATISTICS THAT IT'S PRETTY WELL KNOWN STATISTIC BUT BY NINETEEN HUNDRED. TWENTY THOUSAND NATIVE CHILDREN WERE IN BOARDING SCHOOLS. BY NINETY TWENTY FIVE SIXTY THOUSAND NATIVE CHILDREN WERE BOARDING SCHOOLS AND BY NINETEEN TWENTY SIX NEARLY EIGHTY THREE PERCENT. OF ALL INDIAN SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN WERE IN BOARDING SCHOOLS. SO THAT'S A PRETTY POWERFUL STATISTIC- YOU KNOW THERE'S NARY A FAMILY IN INDIA A COUNTRY THAT HASN'T BEEN AFFECTED BY BOARDING SCHOOLS TO SOME EXTENT. COULD YOU THAT'S EXCITING. HERE'S A PICTURE TO OF THE GROVES AND KIND OF THIS SMUDGING THAT WAS TAKING PLACE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND THE KIDS YOU KNOW. A LOT OF TIMES ONE OF THE REASONS CITED FOR MOVING STUDENTS FROM REMOTING MAYBE CHILDREN FROM THEIR COMMUNITIES WAS HEALTH. ACCEPTED SHERMAN A LOT OF THE BOYS IN IT BEFORE WORKING IN THESE- YOU KNOW POLLUTION LADEN. GROSS HOWEVER AS MANY. NATIVE SCHOLARS AND HAVE WRITTEN PASSED IN AND SHARE THEIR STORIES THE GIRLS ALSO PRIOR PROVIDED AN OPPORTUNITYFOR THEM TO SPEAK THEIR LANGUAGES. TO SING THEIR SONGS AND- A PATH FOR STUDENTS TO SORT OF GET A LITTLE BIT RELIEF FROM THE CONSTANT SURVEILLANCE THAT THEY WERE UNDER ANDERSON AT SHERMAN. HE- NEXT PLEASE. SO ANOTHER PART ANOTHER KIND OF IMPORTANT PART OF THE PROGRAM WAS THE ART PROGRAM IN THE EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY THE U. S. FEDERAL POLICIES REGARDING THE PROTECTION OF NATIVE AMERICAN ART IN OFF RESERVATION BOARDING SCHOOLS SHIFTED FROM SUPPRESSION TO ACTIVE ENGAGEMENT SEEN AS A PATH TO ECONOMIC STABILITY IT MEASURES MINISTRATIONS PUSHED OUR STUDENTS TO CAPITALIZE ON THE ARTISTIC TRADITIONS OF NATIVE CULTURES. ALTHOUGH THIS PUSH LED TO SOME RETENTION OF A FEW CULTURAL PRACTICES TEACHERS OTHER MEMBERS OF THE LOCAL COMMUNITY OFTEN EXPLOITED STUDENT TOP TALENT FOR PROFIT. SEEKING THIS PROFIT STUDENTS MADE SO CALLED INDIAN ART OFTEN NOT FROM THEIR COMMUNITY. AND WITHOUT THE GUIDANCE IN THE CULTURALLY COLLECT CARRILLO CORRECT WAYS TO DO SO. WITHOUT EXPERIENCED ELDERS STUDENTS DID NOT LEARN TOGETHER AND PROCESS MATERIALS FOR BASKETS AND BLANKETS PROPERLY. AND THE INTERGENERATIONAL TRANSFER OF ENVIRONMENTAL KNOWLEDGE THAT HAS EXISTED FOR CENTURIES WAS INTERRUPTED. THE CULTURAL KNOWLEDGE LOSS DURING THIS PERIOD IS NEARLY INCALCULABLE. PLEASE NEXT SIGN. A RELIGIOUS PROGRAMMING WAS ALSO AN IMPORTANT PART OF SHERMAN ALTHOUGH THIS THERE THE BOARDING SCHOOLS WERE INITIALLY STARTED IN SORT OF AN ANTI CATHOLIC FERVOR FROM THE EAST COAST- AND TOGETHER FOR FROM THE EAST COAST IT WAS SOON RECOGNIZED THAT BECAUSE OF THE POPULATION OF CALIFORNIA THAT THEY NEEDED TO COMPETE WITH SOMEWHERE SPECIALLY WITH OTHER BOARDING SCHOOLS LIKE ST BONIFACE WHICH ARE OPERATED BY THE CATHOLIC SCHOOLS. SO UPON ENTERING SHERMAN WAS STUDENTS COULD CHOOSE TO BE PROTESTANT OR CATHOLIC NO OTHER OPTIONS. AND YOUR LOCAL CHURCHES INCLUDING RIVERSIDE WHICH IS KNOWN AS KIND OF A CITY OF CHURCHES COMPETED FOR STUDENT INVOLVEMENT STUDENT ATTENTION- THERE WAS A LOT OF OUTING PROGRAMS INCLUDING YOU KNOW SOME SOMEWHAT CONTROVERSIAL PROGRAMS WITH LOCAL. RIVERSIDE CITIZENS KIND OF CHECKING OUT BOYS AND GIRLS TO TAKE THEM FOR THE EVENING TO DIFFERENT CHURCH ACTIVITIES. AND THERE'S A THERE'S LIKE QUITE A BIT WERE THAT STILL NEEDS TO BE DONE IN THAT AREA BUT IT'S AN IMPORTANT OTHER IMPORTANT PART OF KIND OF THE SELECTION PROCESS. EXIDE THE PERFORMANCES OF. BASICALLY YES. THE SHERMAN PRO OF ASSIMILATION EXTEND TO PERFORMANCES AS WELL. WITH THE GOAL OF REPLACING INDIGENOUS CULTURAL PRACTICES WITH CIVILIZED EUROPEAN AMERICAN PRACTICES THE ADMINISTRATION STAGED ELABORATE DISPLAYS OF INDIANS OBEDIENTLY PARTICIPATING AND FORMS OF CULTURAL PARITY AND DEVALUATION. THE PERFORMANCES OF THIS KIND EMPHASIZE THE LOWER SOCIAL POSITION OF NATIVE AMERICANS WHOSE CHILDREN COULD BE CALLED ON TO PERFORM AT WILL BOTH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF SHERMAN INSTITUTE. SURE RESIDENTS ALSO PUBLICLY PERFORM PLAYS DESIGNED TO INTRODUCE NEW CULTURAL TRADITIONS. THE SCHOOL REPORTS MANY PROGRAMS DEDICATED THE FOUNDING FATHERS SUCH AS THIS ONE WASHINGTON'S HOME COMING. AND TO ANY NATIVE SPECT INCLUDING STUDENTS THEMSELVES THE IMAGE PRESENTS THE ONLY ACCEPTABLE VERSION OF INDIANS AT THIS TIME ONE THAT UNDERSTOOD EUROPEAN AMERICAN CULTURAL DOMINANCE AND BEHAVED ACCORDINGLY. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. ALMOST OF SERVICE STUDENTS DID NOT GRADUATE IN THE EARLY YEARS THE LENGTH OF TIME SPENT AT SCHOOL LARGELY DEPENDED ON THE STUDENTS WILLINGNESS TO CONFORM AT TIMES STUDENTS LEFT AT THE INSISTENCE OF THEIR PARENTS OTHERS WERE SICK AND DIED. HANDFUL STUDENTS RUN AWAY SUCH AS FRANCIS MORONGO DELOS REYES SERRANO- HATED THE CLOSET TREATMENT AND ESCAPE WALKING TWENTY MILES TO HER HOME AND SEVEN WELL. FOR MANY WHO STAYED IN DURING THE PROLONGED SEPARATION FROM FAMILY AND COMMUNITY ACCRUAL FORM OF PUNISHMENT AWAITED. AFTER STUDY INDOCTRINATION OF WHITE EUROPEAN AMERICAN CULTURE. A FORMER STUDENTS COULD NOT ADJUST TO LIFE ON THE RESERVATION AND PURSUE DIFFERENT LIFE WAYS IN THE CITIES. THERE ARE MANY YOUNG YOUNG PEOPLE EXPERIENCE EXTREME FORMS OF RACIAL DISCRIMINATION DESPITE THEIR TRAINING IN CIVILIZATION I COULD NO LONGER DEPEND ON THE SOLACE OF FAMILY OR COMMUNITY. LIKE INSTITUTIONALIZED EX PRISONERS MANY FORMER STUDENTS STRUGGLED OUTSIDE THE WALLS OF THE PRISON ULTIMATE PRICE AND DIED ALONE AT SHERMAN. AWAY FROM THEIR FAMILIES AND THEIR COMMUNITIES. AND AS A PARENT MYSELF I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT THAT KIND OF PAIN. OF WE KEEP GOING. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO WHAT CHANGED OBVIOUSLY SHERMAN TODAY IS MUCH DIFFERENT THAN SHERMAN BEFORE OTHERS A LOT OF FACTORS HERE SO OF FEDERAL GOVERNMENT POLICY CHANGES THERE'S SERIES OF POLICY CHANGES THAT THAT EFFECTIVENESS OF THOSE PROCEDURES NEED OF ACTIVISM A TRIBAL SOVEREIGNTY TRIBAL SUPPORT INCLUDING- LOCAL TRIBES AND- INSTITUTIONAL AND COMMUNITY RECOGNITION SO THIS IS SOMETHING OF COURSE THAT'S ONGOING AND- I LIKE TO THINK OF. YOU KNOW SHERMAN OF THEN AND NOW AS A KIND OF THE PIVOT POINT I THINK AFTER THE AFTER THE EVENTS OF THE SIXTIES IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT AND THEN ALL THESE EXPRESSIONS OF NATIVE SOVEREIGNTY TRIBAL SUPPORT- A LOT OF THESE FORMER STUDENTS CAME BACK TO SHERMAN AND THAT'S WHERE YOU SEE THE REAL CHANGE THE SEACHANGE OF ALL THE NATIVE STUDENTS CAME BACK TEACHING. AND EVEN THOUGH SOME OF THE STUFF YOU KNOW SOME OF THE TEACHERS MIGHT HAVE BEEN STILL SOMEWHAT PRO ASSIMILATION IT'S IMPORTANT TO SEE YOUR OWN FACE AS AN AUTHORITY FIGURE ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE AWAY FROM YOUR FAMILY AND SO I THINK WE CAN LOOK AT ALL THIS BUT YOU KNOW THERE'S A HANDFUL OF EXCEPTIONAL TEACHERS AND THEN JUST. YOU KNOW LOTS OF HOUSE STAFF AND OTHER KINDS OF. I THOUGHT SHERMAN. THAT HAVE MADE ALL THE- IN CHANGE. THE PROGRAMMING OF SHERMAN. THE ATTITUDE OF THE STUDENTS. AND ALSO AFFECTS WHO COMES TO SHERMAN SO NOW COURSE. BACK IN THE DAY IT WAS LIMITED TO TRAIN TRAVEL HORSE TRAVELING FROM WHOEVER CAN GET TO SHERMAN. BUT NOW YOU KNOW WITH THE FLYING YOU COULD WE HAVE STUDENTS FROM ALASKA. STUDENTS FROM BACCHAE STUDENTS THAT. FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS COME BECAUSE THEIR GRANDPARENTS CAME THEIR FATHERS CAME- THEY WANT TO SEE THE BEACH THEY THINK WE'RE CLOSE TO HOLLYWOOD. KIND OF. THEY WANT COULD DISNEYLAND THERE'S LOTS OF DIFFERENT REASONS. BUT OBVIOUSLY SHERMAN TODAY LOOKS MUCH DIFFERENT. ACCUSED IT DOESN'T EXCITE PLEASE. I JUST WANTED TO SHOW THIS ONE THIS IS THE GRADUATE SERVE TO THE- SEVENTEEN SO OBVIOUSLY AS YOU KNOW THAT FIRST. IMAGE I SHOWED OF THE NINETEEN OH NINE GRADUATION. DRESSED IN VICTORIAN DRESS IS SOMETHING A LOT DIFFERENT. SO WE THEY HAVE TO ACTUALLY TO CEREMONIES AND THEY HAVE ONE WHERE THEY WERE YOU KNOW THE TRADITIONAL EUROPEAN ROPES MEDIEVAL ROBES BUT THEN THEY HAVE ANOTHER ONE WHERE THEY WERE TRAVEL. KALYA AND THEY HAVE ALL THE FLAGS OF THE NATIONS REPRESENTATIVE. AND I THINK THAT. THIS PICTURE REALLY ENCAPSULATES WHAT SHERMAN HAS BECOME AND WHAT IT CAN BE IN THE FUTURE. WITH OUR CONTINUED ATTENTION AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU INSIGHTFUL- DISCUSSION AND HISTORY AND AWAKENING RIGHT THE DIFFERENT- ADVOCACY THAT CONTINUES TO BE NEED TO BE DONE AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR RECOGNIZING- A TRIBAL ELDER WHO IS STILL ON- FRANCIS. MORONGO WHO HE MADE THE STATEMENT THAT THE BOARDING SCHOOLS THAT THERE'S NOT THOSE IN IN CALIFORNIA INDIAN PEOPLE THAT HAVEN'T HAD SOME TYPE OF IMPACT AND- IT CERTAINLY- OUR ELDER FRANCIS MORONGO- LEAVING THERE TO WALK BACK. TO THE RESERVATION TWENTY MILES- AS WELL AS MY GRANDMOTHER MARTHA- MANIU- CICCONE WHO THAT WAS AT ST BONIFACE AND- WAS- DISCIPLINED THERE FOR HER UNWILLINGNESS TO. COMPLY AND THAT'S BEEN DOCUMENTED- AS FAR AS BEING- WHIPPED IN SO THAT THESE ARE TRUE- AREAS THAT HAVE AFFECTED OUR PEOPLE. BUT ALSO GOING TO THE LAST LINE OF WHERE WHERE WHERE YOU FALL INTO BUT WE CAN'T EVOLVE SO QUICK. WITHOUT ATTESTING TO THE TRUTH ACTUAL HISTORY OF WHAT HAS BEEN INFLICTED UPON OUR PEOPLE. SORT OF THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY SOLDIER SHE IS AN ASSISTANT PROFESSOR AT SACRAMENTO STATE UNIVERSITY AND IS AN ENROLLED MEMBER OF THE CIVIL OF A BAND OF THE SEGNO INDIANS SHE HAS TAUGHT ETHNIC STUDIES AT NORTHERN ARIZONA UNIVERSITY AND HER RESEARCH AND TEACHING HAS FOCUSED ON TWENTIETH CENTURY AMERICAN INDIAN ACTIVISM SOCIAL AND CULTURAL HISTORY POLITICS EDUCATION AND SOCIAL JUSTICE AND SHE'LL BE JOINING US VIRTUALLY THE SEE IF- IF SHE'S. ABLE TO GO NOW. GOOD MORNING EVERYONE I AM TRYING TO SHARE MY SCREEN BUT I DON'T SEEM TO HAVE THAT OPTION. RIGHT NOW. LET'S SEE IF PERMITTED. THERE YOU WE SEE YOU WELL I THINK NOW IT'S SHOWING UP OKAY. SO LET ME GO AHEAD AND GET STARTED- SO TO FORTY AGAIN I WOULD LIKE TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER JAMES TROUBLES OUT FOR THE INVITATION AND ALSO RECOGNIZE ALL THE- GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS WHO ARE PRESENT I GREATLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ABOUT THIS ISSUE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT- IS DEEPLY PERSONAL AS A PRODUCT OF CALIFORNIA PUBLIC SCHOOLS- BUT IN ADDITION THIS IS WHAT I'VE SPENT YEARS RESEARCHING- AND- I REALLY. APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ABOUT- CALIFORNIA INDIANS IN THE PUBLIC EDUCATIONAL SCHOOL SYSTEM IN ADDITION I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND RECOGNIZE- THE ME WALK THE NISSAN- AND MIGHT YOU. WHICH IS THE TRADITIONAL HOMELANDS- WHERE SACRAMENTO IS LOCATED AT. SO I'VE BEEN TASKED TO SPEAK ABOUT CALIFORNIA INDIANS IN PUBLIC EDUCATION AND SO WE SAW A FROM THE PREVIOUS PRESENTATION A BIT ABOUT BOARDING SCHOOLS. REALLY TO THINK ABOUT- PUBLIC EDUCATION AND SO I WANT TO BEGIN BY HIGHLIGHTING- THIS IS A BOOK THAT I RECOMMEND FOR EVERYONE TO READ IF YOU HAVE NOT READ THIS IS BAD INDIANS IT IS WRITTEN BY. DEBORAH MARANDA SO THIS IS A QUOTE OF FOURTH GRADERS THEIR PARENTS THEIR TEACHERS TOURISTS TO THE MISSIONS EVEN HISTORIANS OFTEN LEARN AND PERPETUATE ONLY ONE STORY ABOUT CALIFORNIANS. CONQUEST SUBJUGATION DEFEAT. DISAPPEARANCE WHEN STILL REALLY THINK ABOUT- THE WAYS IN WHICH A PARTICULAR- PEDAGOGICAL STANDARDS THAT SOMETIMES ARE ACTUALLY EVEN STANDARDS HOW ABOUT THE LASTING LEGACY NOT JUST ON CALIFORNIA INDIAN CHILDREN IN THE K. THROUGH TWELVE SYSTEM. BUT ALSO GO DIFFERENTLY- NON INDIANS WHO ARE IN THE EXACT SAME EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM- AND SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE FOURTH GRADE- MOST OF YOU WHO ARE BORN OR WHO WERE RAISED IN CALIFORNIA MIGHT RECALL THE FOURTH GRADE MISSION UNIT AND THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID SPECIFICALLY REFERENCING AND THIS QUOTE. AND SO TO REALLY THINK ABOUT THE WAYS IN WHICH NATIVE PEOPLE NATIVE CULTURES EXPERIENCES ARE EITHER COMPLETELY ABSENT OR WHEN THEY ARE TAUGHT REALLY LACK THE NUANCE THE SPECIFIC- ITS TIES. I MIGHT BE SPECIFICALLY BROAD AND HOW WE CAN PERHAPS MOVE TO IMPROVE- THE K. TO TWELVE AND EVEN INTO COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. THE WAY IS THAT A NATIVE HISTORIES ARE TAUGHT. I ALSO WANT TO SHARE OF THIS IS A QUOTE FROM LEANNE SIMPSON SO SHE'S MISSION KNOBS- FROM CANADA SHE'S A POET AND SO AN ACADEMIC AND SO SHE- AND THIS QUOTE WHERE SHE'S DISCUSSING LAND AS PEDAGOGY I THINK IT'S VERY REPRESENTATIVE- TO DESCRIBE HOW MANY NATIVE PEOPLE FEEL ABOUT SORT OF GOING THROUGH THE K. THROUGH TWELVE SYSTEM- SO I'M NOT GOING TO READ IT IN ITS ENTIRETY. BUT I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE OF THINGS IN THIS RATE- SHE DISCUSSES AND ASSERTS NO ONE EVER ASKED ME WHAT I WAS INTERESTED IN NOR DID THEY ASK FOR MY CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE. IN THEIR SYSTEM EXPERIENCE OF EDUCATION WAS ONE OF CONTINUALLY BEING MEASURED AGAINST A SET OF PRINCIPLES THAT REQUIRES SURRENDER TO AN ASSIMILATIVE COLONIAL AGENDA IN ORDER TO FULFILL THOSE PRINCIPLES. COMING INTO WISDOM IT TAKES IN THE CONTEXT OF FAMILY COMMUNITY AND RELATIONS. THE LAND IS BOTH CONTEXT AND PROCESS. AND SO SHE'S OUTLINED IN DESCRIBING UPON HOUSE HER REFLECTIONS OF NOT ONLY K. THROUGH TWELVE BUT ALSO HER EXPERIENCES GOING INTO A COLLEGE. NOW I ALSO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT AN INDIVIDUAL IN THIS IS WHO I- AND HIS ORGANIZATION THAT I WROTE MY DISSERTATION ON IT SO THIS IS REPORT COSTA AND SO HE- WAS KOREA I HE WAS- FROM THE CLEAR RESERVATION AND HE- WAS A CO FOUNDER OF AN ORGANIZATION AND CALLED THE AMERICAN INDIAN HISTORICAL SOCIETY- AND SO HIS ORGANIZATION WAS. FORMALLY FOUNDED IN NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR ONE OF THE FIRST SORT OF KEY THINGS THAT THE SOCIETY EXAMINED AND LOOKED AT WAS LOOKING AT THE TEXT BOOKS THAT WERE BEING USED IN THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEMS AND WHILE RUPERT HIMSELF WAS NOT A TRAINED HISTORIAN HE RECOGNIZED ALONG WITH- THE ORGANIZATION THE IMPORT OF HISTORY. THE IMPORT OF WHAT IS BEING TAUGHT THE IMPORT OF THE ENVIRONMENT- THAT NEEDED CHILDREN WERE BEING EXPOSED TO. SPECIFICALLY IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS BUT HE ALSO EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT THE IMPACT THATTHIS WAS HAVING ON NON NATIVE CHILDREN RIGHT SO- THE IDEA OF TEXTBOOKS AND LESSON PLANS THAT THEY ARE SOCIALIZING. BOTH NATIVE AND NON NATIVE CHILDREN ABOUT HOW TO PERCEIVE AND THINK ABOUT- NATIVE CULTURES BROADLY NATIVE PEOPLE BROADLY. AND HE HE WOULD- VERY MUCH REGULARLY ARTICULATE THAT YOU CANNOT EXPECT GREATER SORT OF SOCIETAL PERHAPS- SHIFTS OR CHANGES. IF FOLKS SIMPLY DO NOT HAVE ANY CONCEPT ABOUT NATIVE PEOPLE NEEDED HIS TREES NATIVE EXPERIENCES OR NATIVE VOICES AND SO- THIS PARTICULAR QUOTE COMES FROM A BOOK THAT HE CO WROTE WITH HIS WIFE JANET HENRY ACOSTA. SO HE'S DISCUSSING- HOW IN HIS OPINION EVERY SOCIETY QUOTE HAS EDUCATED ITS YOUNG ACCORDING TO THE BEST INTERESTS OF ITS DOMINANT CLASS PERHAPS THIS CAN CHANGE AND HUMANITY BEING MADE TO SEE ITSELF FACE TO FACE WITHOUT FEAR AND IN SPITE OF THE PANGS OF CONSCIENCE. AND SO AGAIN WHAT THE SOCIETY VERY MUCH SPOKE TO. IS THE IDEA OF THE IMPACT OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS NOW REPORT HIMSELF WAS A PRODUCT OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS- HIS SIBLINGS WERE THE PRODUCTS OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND SPECIFICALLY- CERTAINLY THERE IS A LASTING LEGACY OF BOARDING SCHOOLS AGAIN MOST NATIVE PEOPLE DEPENDING ON ONE'S AGE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. THEIR GRANDPARENTS THEIR GREAT GRANDPARENTS- PERHAPS THEIR PARENTS- WERE FORCED TO ATTEND BOARDING SCHOOLS HOWEVER SPECIFICALLY IN CALIFORNIA- THERE WAS A SHIFT WHERE THE MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIA INDIAN CHILDREN WERE ATTENDING PUBLIC SCHOOLS- BUT I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR THAT SIMPLY BECAUSE ONE HAD ACCESS TO ATTEND PUBLIC SCHOOLS. DID NOT NECESSARILY TRANSLATE INTO EQUITY- WHEN IT CAME TO WHAT WAS POSSIBLE AT PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND SO THE NEXT FEW SLIDES I'M GOING TO DISCUSS SOME OF THE FRAMING- OF INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED IN SCHOOLING FOR NATIVE CHILDREN. SO THIS IS A QUOTE- BY THE INDIAN AGENT FROM ROUND VALLEY- THIS IS A HE WROTE- IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY FOUR SO THIS IS PRIOR TO- SORT OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS BUT IT TO THE REALLY PAY ATTENTION TO THE SCHOOL THIS REPORT- AND SO HE NOTED IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY FOUR AT THAT QUOTE LITTLE PROGRESS CAN BE MADE. IN THEIR EDUCATION WHILE THEY'RE ALLOWED TO RUN IN THE CAMP SUBJECT TO THE TAUNTS AND JEERS OF THE OLD AND THE CONTAMINATIONS OF THE YOUNGER AND MIDDLE AGED NOW WHAT AGENT SHELDON WAS REFERENCING IS THAT HE WAS A FIRM BELIEVER. IN BOARDING SCHOOLS HE FIRMLY BELIEVES THAT THE ROOF PHYSICAL REMOVAL OF CHILDREN WAS NECESSARY- IN ORDER TO- REALLY SORT OF MEET THAT GOAL OF ASSIMILATION SO WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT BOARDING SCHOOLS PRIMARILY- THEY SERVED AS- A COLONIAL ASSIMILATIONIST TACTIC GREAT. HOW CAN YOU REMOVE CULTURE HOW CAN YOU REMOVE CONNECTION CAN YOU REMOVE KINSHIP- AND HE GREAT SO HE HE HE'S SPEAKING AND REFERENCING IN THIS GOVERNMENT REPORT ALSO IN A VERY PATERNALISTIC MANNER HE'S TALKING ABOUT THE IDEA OF CONTAMINATIONS. THIS IS THE REASON THAT WE HAVE TO REMOVE THE CHILDREN FROM I'M RESERVATIONS BECAUSE THEY COULD BE CONTAMINATED- YOU KNOW LITTLE PROGRESS CAN BE MADE AND I'VE BEEN SHARING THIS QUOTE TO HAVE TO PRESENT- YOU KNOW THE SORT OF THE MINDSET- WHEN IT CAME TO SORT OF FORMAL EDUCATION OF CALIFORNIA INDIAN CHILDREN. SO WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT EDUCATION FOR CALIFORNIA AND ITS CHILDREN THERE REALLY CAN BE DIVIDED INTO ROUGHLY THREE DIFFERENT TIME PERIODS- SO YOU KNOW BETWEEN THIS THE BEGINNING OF STATEHOOD- TO ROUGHLY NINETEEN SIXTY. AT NINETEEN SIXTEEN CALIFORNIA INDIAN CATION EXISTED PRIMARILY THROUGH FEDERAL BOARDING SCHOOLS- BASED SCHOOLS AND SOME CONTRACTS- WITH LARGELY RELIGIOUS- PRIMARILY CATHOLIC SCHOOLS- REALLY WHEN YOU'RE THEN I'M SPEAKING TO- WHAT THE PREVIOUS PRESENTATION MENTIONED I WHICH WAS THE- SECTION SIXTEEN SIXTY TWO IN CALIFORNIA. THIS IS WHAT WAS UTILIZED TO EXCLUDE NATIVE CHILDREN FROM ATTENDING REGULAR SCHOOLS- AND SO YOU THEN HAVE. TO ASK YOU THINK- THE THIRD PERIOD WHICH IS- I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT IT IN A COUPLE OF SLIDES- WHICH IS AFTER THE PAPER DECISION- BUT THIS IS AN ADDRESS THAT WAS WRITTEN BY- THE CALIFORNIA STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC EDUCATION EDWARD HYATT AT THE TIME- THIS WAS A SPEECH THAT HE GAVE- AND- HE- IS ASSERTED IN HIS SPEECH QUOTE THE BEST SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM. IS FOR THE INDIAN CHILDREN TO BE SQUARELY TAKEN INTO OUR ORDINARY STATES TRICKS SCHOOLS AND TAUGHT BY THE SAME TEACHERS IN TE SAME WAY AS OTHER CHILDREN. SO IN NINETEEN FOURTEEN THAT SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION IS REALLY PUSHING FOR THIS IDEA OF TO A DEGREE INTEGRATION. HOWEVER HE TEMPERS HIS COMMENT- BY NOTING THAT ONLY POSITIVE RESULTS COULD BE POSSIBLE. AKIF QUOTE WHEN EVER INDIAN CHILDREN ARE FEW AS COMPARED WITH THE WHITES AND SO WHAT HE'S ARGUING IN THE SPEECH IS THAT WHILE INTEGRATION COULD PERHAPS BE POSSIBLE THAT AGAIN IT IS ONLY- PERHAPS- YOU KNOW ASSIMILATIONIST. IF NEEDED CHILDREN ARE IN THE MINORITY POPULATION- YOU ALSO HAVE LATER ON GOVERNMENT REPORTS THAT ARE DOCUMENTING ONE OF THE CAUSES THAT A LOT OF- WHITE PARENTS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT INTEGRATION IS THAT THEY'RE WORRIED THAT THEIR CHILDREN ARE PERHAPS GOING TO BEGIN. I'M DATING OR HAVING ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS WITH- INDIAN TEENAGERS- AND SO HIS IS SORT OF WHAT IS MOTIVATING SOME OF THESE- IDEOLOGIES THAT ARE BEING HELD- SO IT'S VERY ANTI INDIAN AT SOME. SO AGAIN TO HIGHLIGHT THE SHIFT BEGINS TO OCCUR SPECIFICALLY IN CALIFORNIA- THIS DATA COMES FROM THE ANNUAL REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF INDIAN AFFAIRS TO THE SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR. SO YOU CAN SEE OUTLINED RATE IN NINETEEN FIFTEEN- THAT THERE ARE ONLY THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN CALIFORNIA INDIAN STUDENTS- BASED ON THE DATA THAT'S AVAILABLE BECAUSE THAT COULD BE- GREAT- DOCUMENTS CAN SOMETIMES BE WRONG- BUT THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN BY NINETEEN SIXTEEN IT'S ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND SIXTY NINE. IN NINETEEN SEVENTEEN IT'S ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE AND BY NINETEEN EIGHTEEN AND SUBSEQUENTLY THROUGHOUT THE REMAINDER OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY- THE MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIA INDIAN STUDENTS ARE ATTENDING PUBLIC SCHOOLS. AND SO IT WAS ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND TWENTY IN COMPARISON TO ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE AND SO NINETEEN EIGHTEEN IS THAT THAT YEAR THAT THAT OCCURS. SO THE PAPER DECISION IS LARGELY- CELEBRATED THOUGH ODDLY NOT KNOWN BUT A LOT OF FOLKS- THE PAPER DECISION INVOLVED THE TEENAGER FIFTEEN YEAR OLD BY THE NAME OF ALICE PAPER SHE WAS BY YOU- SHE WAS A RESIDENT OF BIG PINE. AND THE MAP YEAR SIR LIKE WHERE IS BIG TIME- SO HER PARENTS FILED A LAWSUIT. AND ULTIMATELY THERE WAS THE UNANIMOUS CALIFORNIA STATE SUPREME COURT DECISION THAT ARGUED THAT THERE WAS NO CAUSE FOR HER IN ELIGIBILITY FOR ATTENDING A LOCAL PUBLIC SCHOOL. EVEN IF THERE WAS A DAY SCHOOL AND AN INDIAN DAY SCHOOL- NEARBY TOO- AND SO THIS WAS THIS DECISION- WAS ANNOUNCED THE VERY SAME DAY THAT YOU HAVE THE NINETEEN. TWENTY FOUR INDIAN CITIZENSHIP ACT- AND SO- THIS. COURT DECISION ALONG WITH THE MENDEZ DECISION WE'RE ACTUALLY CITED AND USED- IN ULTIMATELY THE NINETEEN FIFTY FOUR BROWN VERSUS BOARD OF EDUCATION TO PEEK A KANSAS- WHICH WE ALL KNOW- ENDED. I'M SCHOOL SEGREGATION HOWEVER EVEN THAT DECISION- IT UTILIZED THE PHRASE WITH ALL DELIBERATE SPEED AND SO THIS MEANT THAT FOR ACTUALLY SEVERAL YEARS SCHOOL DISTRICTS AROUND THE COUNTRY- DID NOT INTEGRATE PURPOSELY- AND SO YOU CAN SEE. A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT- THE PAPER DECISION RIGHT THAT SHE COULD NOT BE PREVENTED FROM ATTENDING A PUBLIC SCHOOL- BECAUSE SHE WAS OF INDIAN BLOOD- TO THEN JUMP IN TIME IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES THERE ARE- LIKE- PROFESSOR DIXON MENTIONED- A SERIES OF GOVERNMENT REPORTS THERE'S ALSO A SERIES OF HEARINGS AND SO. THIS IS JUST AN EXAMPLE OF- THAT WAS DESCRIBED BY DENISON NIGHTS HE WAS PUMMELED YOU KYRA- AND SO HE SHARED THE STORY OF THE TEACHER ACTING AS A HALL MONITOR WHO GRABBED FOR YOUNG INDIAN WOMEN- MARCH THEM TO THE PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE WITH THE LOUD PRONUNCIATION. I'M HERE ARE YOUR FOR BLACK RATS- HE COMMENTED IN DESCRIBING THIS THE CAUSES OF DISCRIMINATION APPEAR TO STAY. LONG TIME DEEP ROOTED PREJUDICES OF THIS AREA. AND SO THIS OCCURRED WITHIN A PUBLIC SCHOOL- YOU ALSO HAVE IN NINETEEN TWENTY SIX THE COMMONWEALTH CLUB OF CALIFORNIA ISSUED A REPORT. AND THE DETAILS RIGHT SO THIS IS AFTER NINETEEN TWENTY FOUR WHEN INDIAN CHILDREN CALVIN INDIAN CHILDREN ARE- LEGALLY SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO ATTEND PUBLIC SCHOOLS- BUT WHAT THE DETAIL IS THAT- THIS OCCURS AND IT RANGES. WHAT THEY TERM CRUEL FLIRTATION TO QUOTE FRIENDLINESS AND HONESTY- THE REPORT SHARED THE STORY OF MIDDLE CREEK DISTRICT IN LEE COUNTY CALIFORNIA- DUE TO A CLOSURE OF. AN INDIAN TO YOU SCHOOL THE PUBLIC SCHOOL THEIR ACCEPTED FOURTEEN INDIAN CHILDREN. HOWEVER IT PARTITIONED OFF A SPECIAL ROOM FOR THESE STUDENTS IT FENCED IN A SECTION OF THE PLAYGROUND AND IT HIRED A% SEPARATE TEACHER FOR THEM SO DESPITE THE NINETEEN TWENTY FOUR- PAPER DECISION DESPITE THE IDEA BREAK THAT. KHALFAN INDENTURE SHOULD BE ABLE AND BEING A LEGALLY PROTECTED TO ATTEND PUBLIC SCHOOLS AGAIN THIS DOES NOT NECESSARILY TRANSLATE TO EQUITY THIS DOES NOT NECESSARILY TRANSLATE TO ACTUALLY. RECEIVING YOU KNOW EQUAL EDUCATION IF YOU'RE FANCYING OFF A PLAYGROUND BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT THE INDIAN CHILDREN TO BE ABLE TO YOU KNOW US SOCIALIZE WITH THE NON INDIAN CHILDREN. THERE IS SOMETHING GOING ON WITH THAT DECISION THAT IS BEING MADE. I ALSO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT- SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION THIS WAS DR MAX RAFFERTY SO HE WAS THE SUPERINTENDENT FROM SIXTY THREE TO SEVENTY- HIS ELECTION WAS THE VERY FIRST TIME THAT THE SUPERINTENDENT POSITION APPEARED ON THE CALIFORNIA BALLOT- SO THAT PEOPLE ACTUALLY VOTED HE WON BY FIFTY TWO PERCENT- WAS. CLOSE AND SO HE ACTUALLY WAS AN INDIVIDUAL THAT WORKED WITH THE ORGANIZATION THAT I MENTION COSTA FOUNDED- AND THE SOCIETY FORMED WHAT WAS KNOWN AS THE INDIAN HISTORY STUDY COMMITTEE- AND SO I TO NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE STATE CURRICULA COMMISSION MIDI CHAIRED BY RAFFERTY- WHERE THE SOCIETY PRISON. WART RAP REMARKED PUB FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME ABOUT THE- MANNER IN WHICH- NATIVE CULTURES WERE- PRESENTED IN TEXTBOOKS AND SO HE REMARKED THAT INDIAN HISTORY WAS ONE OF THE QUOTE. MOST NEGLECTED AREAS IN CALIFORNIA TEXTBOOKS. I'M AND SO THIS IS A LIST OF THE- INDIAN HISTORY STUDY COMMITTEE AGAIN MOST OF THEM. ARE CALIFORNIA INDIAN- THERE'S A LINK THAT I CAN SHARE WITH FOLKS YOU CAN WATCH IT A LITTLE LATER ON- BUT I'M GOING TO HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE OF BOOKS THAT SOCIETY TARGETED AND SO ONE AT THE TIME PERIOD. A CALIFORNIA HAD THE STATE PRINTING PRESS AND SO ALL THE BOOKS ARE THE SAME THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE STATE- AND SO THEY LOOK AT HELEN BOWERS CALIFORNIA GOLD DAYS THIS WAS UTILIZED IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES AND THE NINETEEN SIXTIES- AND SO YOU CAN SEE HOW SHE'S TALKING ABOUT THE GOLD RUSH- SHE ALSO INCLUDES THIS QUOTE WERE THOSE INDIANS HIDING BEHIND THOSE THICK BUSHES- AND SO THE CHALLENGE THIS BOOK. HOWEVER THE STATE DETERMINED THAT THIS BOOK WAS FINE FOR A CONTINUED USE. THE SOCIETY ALSO WORKED ON- A BOOK CALLED THE LAND OF FOLKS THIS WAS WRITTEN BY JAMES HARLOW THIS WAS USED IN THE OAKLAND UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT WHAT WHICH WAS- RELOCATED- IT SELECTED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR OUT OF STATE INDIANS TO MOVE TO CALIFORNIA. THIS WAS ORIGINALLY PUBLISHED IN FIFTY THREE IT WAS ALSO REPRINTED IN FIFTY FIVE AND FIFTY NINE SO IF YOU ATTENDED SCHOOLS IN OAKLAND UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT IN THE FIFTIES OR THE SIXTIES THERE'S A REALLY GOOD CHANCE THAT YOU USE THIS BOOK- SO HARLOW USED PHRASES IN TERMS OF HIS BOOK LIKE A BIGGER INDIAN. WHICH IS A SLUR SPOOKY SONGS STRANGE LOOKING HOUSES HE ALSO COMMENTED IT QUOTE EVERY TIME YOU DIG INTO THE GROUND YOU ARE LIKELY TO BUMP INTO SOMETHING YOU COULD USE TO DECORATE YOUR HOME AT HOLLY. WHAT HE IS REFERENCING IN THAT- ARE HUMAN REMAINS SKELETONS. I'M SO THE SOCIETY ALONG WITH THE- OAKLAND AMERICAN INDIAN ASSOCIATION AS ALONG WITH THE OAKLAND INTERTRIBAL FRIENDSHIP HOUSE- REALLY WENT AFTER THIS BOOK NOW THE DISTRICT DECIDED THAT THEY DID REMOVE THIS BOOK. HOWEVER PERHAPS AND A PUBLIC WAY TO MINIMIZE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF NOT ONLY THE SOCIETY BUT ALSO NEEDED PARENTS. YOU HAVE THE DIRECTOR OF A STRUCTURAL MEDIA I TELL THE OAKLAND TRIBUNE THAT THE BOOK WAS OBSOLETE I HAD ALREADY BEEN SCHEDULED TO BE REMOVED BUT THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF- SORT OF- CREATING ALLIANCES TO HAVE BOOKS REMOVED AND TO THINK ABOUT AGAIN. THE IMPACT THAT THIS BOOK WOULD HAVE NOT ONLY ON NATIVE CHILDREN IN THE OAKLAND UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT BUT ALSO HOW THIS IS TEACHING NON NATIVE CHILDREN TO THINK ABOUT NATIVE PEOPLE- OF COURSE AGAIN MANY OF YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH- WHAT WAS KNOWN AS A SORT OF THE SUGAR CUBE MISSION SOMETIMES POPSICLE STICKS. I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR THAT IN pTHE FALL OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ANNOUNCED ITS NEW EDUCATIONAL HISTORY SOCIAL SCIENCE FRAMEWORK- BECAUSE IT DETERMINED THAT THE MISSION UNIT WAS OFFENSIVE AND ACTUALLY TAUGHT LITTLE HISTORICAL OF INFORMATION ACCURATE INFORMATION AND ALSO CAN BE VERY CLEAR THAT THE IDEA OF THE DIORAMA. WAS ACTUALLY NEVER PART OF A FORMAL- STATE WIDE CURRICULUM THIS IS SOMETHING THAT- TEACHERS DID ON THEIR OWN AND IT BEGAN TO REPEAT AND THIS IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF HOW WHAT YOU ARE EXPOSED TO YOURSELF PERHAPS LEAD YOU TO AS YOU GROW UP. AND INTO YOUR CHOSEN REFLECTION YOU BEGIN TO CONTINUE TO MIMIC THAT FOR DECADES THIS WAS A MAINSTAY IN- CALIFORNIA FOURTH GRADE- THE MISSION UNIT AND WHAT THE STATE IS NOW DOING IS REALLY EXAMINING HOW TO REVISE- AND CORRECT- WHAT SORT OF. IS TAUGHT IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS I ALSO REALLY WANT TO QUICKLY MENTION A COUPLE OF INSTANCES SO IN FEBRUARY OF TWENTY. DON'T GET ELEMENTARY SCHOOL A- THAT WAS SORT OF CIRCULATOR AS HOMEWORK AND SO INCLUDED THINGS LIKE QUOTE THE WOMEN WERE CALLED SCHOOL LAWS AN INDIAN WORD FOR WOMEN. OF COURSE WE KNOW THAT GIVEN THE TERM SQUAD THE WEIGHT IT PLACES ARE BEING RENAMED THIS IS ACTUALLY AN APPROPRIATE- BUT THIS IS WHAT WAS BEING UTILIZED IN THEM AND THEY ELEMENT ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CLASS. LASTLY TO BRING ATTENTION TO A HANDFUL OF REPORTS ABOUT SORT OF THE IMPORTANCE OF IMAGERY SO THE AMERICAN INDIAN COLLEGE FUND REPORT CREATING VISIBILITY NOTES THE INVISIBILITY IS IN ESSENCE HE MODERN FORM OF RACISM. USED TO GET STATE OF AMERICANS IT IS THIS INVISIBILITY THAT LEADS TO COLLEGE ACCESS AND COMPLETION CRISIS AMONG NATIVE AMERICAN STUDENTS YOU ALSO HAVE THE TRIBAL COLLEGE JOURNAL OF AMERICAN INDIANS- ENTITLED CREATING COMMUNITY. IT ARGUES THAT THERE'S IMPORTANT FACTORS FOR- NOT ONLY- COLLEGE ATTENDANCE BUT ALSO SUCCESSFUL GRADUATION SURROUNDING YOURSELF WITH COMMUNITY AND ALSO HAVING AT LEAST ONE SUPPORTIVE MENTOR OR ADVISER. LASTLY I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT BE ELIMINATED RECLAIMING NATIVE TRUTH REPORT WHICH REALLY ARTICULATES THE IDEA OF NOT ONLY EDUCATION BEING A KEY LEVER FOR CHANGE ACROSS. ALL OF THIS RESEARCH IN THIS REPORT BUT ALSO A RECOGNITION THAT PEOPLE BOTH NATIVE AND NONNATIVE RECOGNIZED THAT WHAT THEY'RE BEING TAUGHT IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS IS AN ACCURATE. AND IS INDEED- A DEFICIT AND SO THIS IS A PLACE A SITE WHERE PERHAPS THERE CAN BE A CHANGE- SO. THIS IS A WRAP UP OF MY PRESENTATION SO I WOULD LIKE TO END AGAIN WITH MY APPRECIATION AND GRATITUDE I REMIND EVERYONE TO RESIST. FOR A FIVE AN INDIGENOUS THANK YOU. THANK YOU- SO MUCH FOR THAT- TESTIMONY. AND BRING IT TO LIFE THE VERY HISTORY OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND ITS TREATMENT TOWARDS- CALIFORNIA INDIAN PEOPLE AND NOT JUST IN AND HISTORY BUT IT'S STILL HAPPENING NOW AS YOU YOU REFERENCE TO A BOOK THAT WAS BEING USED IN THE SCHOOL SYSTEM. AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN SO WE'RE STILL- IDENTIFYING AND WORKING TO ELIMINATE ALL THOSE THINGS I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THAT. THAT FORWARD- A SPIN IT AND BRINGING TO LIGHT THE PIPER DECISION THAT- MANY- WROTE DOWN. AND SO THEY'RE GONNA GO ON RESEARCH THAT BUT THE PIPER DECISION WAS ALSO- DURING THE SAME TIME THAT THE INDIAN CITIZEN SHIP FACT MOVE FORWARD SO WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HIGHLIGHT THE PIPER DECISION. AND HOW THAT ACTUALLY- IMPACTED- CALIFORNIA INDIAN PEOPLE HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SONA THANK EACH ONE OF THE PRESENTERS- FOR OUR PANEL ONE DISCUSSION.

FOUNDER HAD COMMITTED UPON THE UKEE AND THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO ATONE FOR THESE WRONGDOINGS. I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE AN EXAMPLE OF A PARTICULAR STORY OF THESE ATROCITIES. I WAS GOING TO TELL YOU THE STORY OF A TEN YEAR OLD GIRL WHO WAS KILLED. JUST BECAUSE SHE WAS BEEN STUBBORN INSTEAD. I'D LIKE TO SHARE THE STORY OF BLOODY WRONG. THIS IS AN ACCOUNTING FROM ONE OF THE SETTLERS. AS THE STORY GOES. THERE WAS A BAND OF THE SIXTY FIVE UN ARMED YUKI. THEY WERE HANDED DOWN OVER HILLS AND THROUGH THE CANYONS OF THE EEL RIVER. IT WAS AT THIS PLACE WHERE THERE WAS A ROCK FORMATION THAT WAS. OVER A HUNDRED FIFTY FEET OF SHEER DROP. ON THREE SIDES AND AT ITS BASE IT WAS GUARDED BY SMALL BOULDERS AND ROCKS. THE IRAQIS WERE HANDED IN ON ONE SIDE HEADED OFF ON ANOTHER. THE YANKEES WERE HALF CRAZED BY SLEEPLESS NIGHTS AND DAYS OF TERROR. FLEEING FROM THOSE WHO HUNTED THEM. THEY WERE OFFERED THREE ALTERNATIVES EITHER CONTINUE AND FIGHT AND BE PICKED OFF ONE BY ONE. CONCEDE TO A TRUCE AND THEN RETURNED TO ROUND VALLEY. WHERE THEY WOULD BE. EVENTUALLY PERISHED FROM HUNGER. OR LARGE HANDS AND LEAVE OFF THE BOULDER. SO THE UK'S ADVANCED TO THE EDGE OF THIS MIGHTY BOULDER. JOIN HANDS TOGETHER AND COMMENCED TO SING THEIR DESK PHONE. WITH THEIR CRIES THEY LIVE DOWN. DOWN TO THEIR DEATHS. NO YOU GET A SKATE OR WAS CAPTURED. AND MANY YEARS LATER THE BURNS OF THE UK WERE STILL IN EVIDENCE AT THE BOTTOM OF BLOODY WROTE. ADDITIONAL DETAILS IN THAT TIME JANUARY EIGHTEEN FIFTY NINE THE SACRAMENTO DAILY UNION PUBLISHED REPORTS. IN MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED FIFTY YUKI INDIANS. HAVE BEEN KILLED BY WHITE WITHIN FOUR MONTHS THREE TO FOUR MONTHS IN THE U. K. I'M- IN THE EDEN VALLEY REGIONS. J. ROSS BROWN LATER WROTE. AT ROUND VALLEY DURING THE WINTER OF EIGHTEEN FIFTY EIGHT. TO EIGHTEEN FIFTY NINE MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED FIFTY PEACEABLE INDIANS INCLUDING WOMEN AND CHILDREN WERE CRUELLY SLAUGHTERED BY THE WHITES. IT'S SETTLED PAYER UNDER OFFICIAL AUTHORITY. ARM PARTIES WENT INTO THE RANCHERIAS ONE DAY WHEN NO ILLICIT APPREHENDED AND SHUT THE INDIANS DOWN WE HARMLESS AND DEFENCELESS AS THEY WERE WITHOUT DISTINCTION OF H. SIX SHOT DOWN WOMEN RECYCLING BABES IN THEIR OMNIVOROUS. KILLED OR CRIPPLED THE NAKED CHILDREN THAT WERE RUNNING ABOUT. ON JANUARY TWENTIETH THE DAILY ALTA CALIFORNIA REPORTED THE SLAUGHTER OF ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY INDIANS IN THE LOCALITY OF ROUND VALLEY. THE SOLDIERS TRIED TO BE PEACEKEEPERS BUT WHEN THERE WAS A COMPLAINT TO WASHINGTON THE US ARMY COMMANDER ORDERED THEM TO QUIT PROTECTING THE ROUND VALLEY INDIANS FROM WHAT WAS IN L. A. PROFOUND LETHAL KILLING MACHINE AND THUS. UNDERSCORING FEDERAL CULPABILITY IN THE REGION'S GENOCIDE. DILLON REPORTED FROM ROUND VALLEY. THE PARTY THAT WENT TO EDEN VALLEY TO HUNT THE INDIANS. HAVE BEEN THERE NEARLY TWO WEEKS HUNTING INDIANS. AND THAT TWO HUNDRED FORTY INDIANS WERE KILLED. AN INFORMANT WHO HAD JUST ARRIVED AT REPORTED THAT IN THE VICINITY OF T. OF ROUND VALLEY WITHIN THE PAST THREE WEEKS THERE WERE FROM THREE HUNDRED TO FOUR HUNDRED BUCKS SCORES IN CHILDREN THAT WERE KILLED BY THE WHITE. IN A TOTAL THESE REPORTS SUGGEST THE KILLING PRIMARILY BY VIGILANTES OF AT LEAST FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY AND PERHAPS AS MANY AS NINE HUNDRED TEN INDIAN PEOPLE. IN THE ROUND VALLEY REGION. WITHIN FIVE MONTHS. THERE ARE NOT ONLY A FEW HUNDRED FOR THE THOUSANDS OF STORIES. OF HOW MY ANCESTORS POPULATION WAS DISSEMINATED. THE YOU CAN POPULATION WENT FROM AROUND TWENTY THOUSAND. DOWN TO THREE HUNDRED IN LITTLE UNDER THREE YEARS. THIS IS TRULY NOT JUST ABOUT A NAME CHANGE. IN EIGHTEEN FORTY SIX SERENA FACING FROM THOMAS FAMILY MET AS YOUNG MEN. DURING THE WESTWARD MOVEMENT YOUNG MAN WITH PLANS TO HEAD WEST IN GAME THEIR POSITIONS OF WEALTH AND POWER. WELL THEY WERE DREAMING AND LINK THEIR PLANS. THEY LIVE IN THEIR STRONGHOLD THAT PROTECTED THEM ALLOW THEM TO CARRY ON WITH THEIR CULTURAL WAY OF LIFE. THE WHAT VALLEY WAS SO ABUNDANT. THAT EVERY THAT IT EASILY SUPPORTED THE TWENTY THOUSAND OR MORE YOU CAN. THAT WAS UNTIL AROUND EIGHTEEN FIFTY FOUR. SERENA TASTINGS AND THOMAS HANDLING. MAY THEIR PLANS THEY BOTH SERVED TIME ON AS A US REPRESENTATIVES. SO THEY KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH THE GOVERNMENT AND AN INDIAN COUNTRY SUPERINTENDENT OF THE ROUND VALLEY RESERVATION. WHERE HE AIDED AND ABETTED HIS FRIEND. SERENUS WAS NOT JUST ANOTHER ACTOR WHAT HE DID. STARTED A SNOWBALL EFFECT. IT PUT SYSTEMS IN PLACE FUNDED SYSTEMS. HE ORGANIZED AN EFFORT TO CLEAR THE LANDS OF THE UK AND THE MILITIA OF PAID BY THE STATE. HE USED TO MARK PROCEED TO KILL PEOPLE. THERE ARE RECORDS OF ORDINARY CITIZENS THAT WROTE LETTERS TO THE GOVERNOR. ORDINARY PEOPLE FROM MENDOCINO COUNTY. BUT TOLD OF THE ATROCITIES BY THE HORRIBLE SLAUGHTERING OF YOU KEEP PEOPLE. THIS IS A QUOTE FROM CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY. ACCOUNTS ARE COMING IN FROM THE COUNTIES ON THE COAST RANGE. OF SICKENING ATROCITIES AND WHOLESALE SLAUGHTER SAID A GREAT NUMBERS OF DEFENSELESS INDIANS. FOR THIS FOR AN EVIL THIS OF THIS MAGNITUDE. SOMEONE IS RESPONSIBLE THERE ARE GOVERNMENT OR CITIZENS OR BOTH OF TO BLAME PROMINENT STATESMEN. HE WROTE GOVERNOR WILDER AND GOVERNOR RULER WAS AT HIS PERSONAL FRIEND OF HIS. PERSONAL LETTERS TO THE GOVERNOR AND MILITARY COMMANDERS PRESSURING THEM TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE INDIANS SO THE LAND WOULD BE CLEAR OF THEM WHILE. WHAT AND WHEN THE WHITE SETTLERS ARRIVED. HASTINGS KEPT PRESSURING AND PRESSURING AND OFFERING THEM MONEY FOR SALARY AND SUPPLIES FOR THE MILITIA. AND WHEN THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE FINALLY AGREED HASTINGS'S READY. THE MILITIA WAS CALLED THE L. A. RIVER RANGERS. IT WAS LED BY WALTER DARBO. A WELL KNOWN VIOLENT PSYCHOTIC KILLER. THIS CONFLICT WAS COLD THE MENDOCINO WARS IT WAS BETWEEN THE YANKEES AND THE WHITE SETTLERS IN MENDOCINO CALAMY LASTING FROM JULY EIGHTEEN FIFTY NINE THREE JANUARY EIGHTEEN SIXTY. IT WAS BECAUSE BY SETTLER INTRUSION AND SLAVE RAIDS ON NATIVE LAND SUBSEQUENT MADE. A NATIVE RETALIATION RESULTING IN THE DEATHS OF HUNDREDS OF YUKI'S. IT TOOK THE POPULATION OF MY PEOPLE FROM TWENTY THOUSAND DOWNTO THREE HUNDRED. AND ONLY IN SIX MONTHS. HASTINGS WAS SURELY NO ORDINARY GUY. THIS IS A VERY TRAUMATIZING TO ME. DRAMATIZING TO READ PRIVATE TRAUMATIZING TO FILL THE HEARD OF MY ANCESTORS. AND IS NOT. TO BE SEEN. NOT TO BE. SEEING THE INVISIBLE. DO YOU HAVE TO FIGHT TO BE SEEN DO YOU COULD DO NOT WANT TO BE INVISIBLE. WE WANT A TRANSPARENT PROCESS WE DESERVE IT AND THE PUBLIC DESERVES IT- ASKING TO CHANGE THE NAME OF THE COLLEGE INTO A YOU CAN NAME. IT'S VERY MINIMAL THAT THE STATE CAN DO ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF THIS HISTORY. BECAUSE NOTHING WILL CHANGE HISTORY. WE ARE ASKING FOR RESTORATIVE JUSTICE AND THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE ANY NAME FROM OUR LANGUAGE SALUTE THE LAW SCHOOL. AND THOSE WHO RETURN THE INSTITUTION WILL BE PARTICIPANTS IN RESTORATIVE JUSTICE EFFORTS DALY. BY SPEAKING AND HELPING TO REVITALIZE THE U. K. LANGUAGE. THE NEW NAME SHOULD BE ONE THAT WILL NEVER ALLOW US TO FORGET. ALL THE UNTHINKABLE HORRORS AND I MENTION WILL. ATROCITIES SPONSORED AND DIRECTED BY CERAMIST HASTINGS AND STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE PROPOSAL DEFLATION IS AN ESSENTIAL FIRST STEP IN THE TRAUMA HEALING DELIVERY OF JUSTICE FOR THE DESCENDANTS OF THE STATE SPONSORED GENOCIDE THAT OCCURRED SPECIFICALLY AT THE URGING AND ACTIVITIES. SUPPORT ACTIVE SUPPORT THE SERRATED MISS HASTINGS THE RESTORATIVE JUSTICE MEASURES INCLUDING THE NAME CHANGE WILL AID IN SOME OF THE SUFFERING OF THE ATROCITIES ASSOCIATED WITH UC HASTINGS COLLEGE OF THE LAW'S NAMESAKE. THE PICK UP PEOPLE HAVE SUFFERED EFFECTS OF LOS AND HOMELAND. GENOCIDAL MURDER OF HIS ANCESTORS. GENOCIDAL PAIN. GENERATIONAL PAIN AND TRAUMA. FOR THE HEINOUS ACTS OF MISTER HASTINGS FOR NEARLY ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY YEARS. HE HAD A STUDIO. LET JUSTICE BE DONE. SURE OF THE YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY AND FOR REPRESENTING THE IRAQI PEOPLE AND- THE ANCESTORS BEING ABLE TO SPEAK HERE AND THE CHAMBERS- HERE THE STATE LEGISLATURE BRINGING TESTIMONY FORWARD.

SECONDLY I'LL START TO ADD LIKE TO START WITH GIVING THANKS TO OUR CREATOR. THE GREAT SPIRIT OUR LORD IN HEAVEN. THANK YOU FOR HIM FOR THIS BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL DAY BRING US TOGETHER TO DISCUSS THESE IMPORTANT ISSUES I WILL AFFECT ALL INDIAN TRIBES. JUST A QUICK NOTE TODAY WE FIND OURSELVES IN A WORLD NEARLY AT WAR. THAT COULD ASKING ESCALATE VERY QUICKLY AND EFFECTIVE TIRE WORLD WE ALSO FIND OURSELVES IN THE SECOND YEAR OF A WORLDWIDE PANDEMIC. THAT HAS AFFECTED. EVERY NATION AND OUR COUNTRY AND EVERY COMMUNITY- CERTAINLY OUR COMMUNITY AROUND VALLEY. SO I GUESS THE QUESTION BECOMES HOW DO WE CARRY ON NORMAL BUSINESS WHEN WE HAVE ALL OF THIS STUFF GOING ON THAT'S WE SEE AROUND US EVERY DAY. AND AND HOW DO WE JUST CARRY ON OUR DAY TO DAY AND LOOK AT RESOLVING ISSUES SUCH AS THIS- WITH ALL THIS GOING ON. HOWEVER WE'RE NOT HERE TODAY TO SOLVE ALL THE WORLD'S PROBLEMS. WE'RE HERE TODAYTO TALK ABOUT AND FOCUS ON SOME OF THE INDIAN ISSUES THAT WE DEAL WITH AND MORE SPECIFICALLY THE ROUND ALI. I'D LIKE TO THANK A GERMAN RAMOS AND ALSO ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY SELECT COMMITTEE ON NATIVE AMERICAN AFAIRS. FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY ON BEHALF OF THE RIVAL INDIAN TRIBES. AND TO LET THE PROCESS BEGIN OF TELLING OUR STORY. AS MONA HAS REALLY SET THE TABLE ON ON WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE TODAY. AND BUT ANYWAY IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO- THAT OUR STORY BE TOLD. AND TO START THE PROCESS. WHATEVER YOU KEY ELDERS CAME INTO OUR- ONE OF OUR MEETINGS IN ROUND VALLEY. AND SHOES VERY FORTHRIGHT FORTHCOMING AND FORTHRIGHT BY STAYING THAT. ALL OF OUR TRIBES AROUND ALI HAVE A STORY TO TELL. AND IS MOST MOST SPECIFICALLY THE UK'S WHO ARE INVOLVED IN A LOT OF THIS TRAGIC. STUFF THAT IS GONNA. ANSWER BUT- BUT WE THANKED HER FOR COMING IN THAT DAY TO BRING IT UP AND- THAT SHE HAD SOME STORIES TO BE TOLD THAT SHE TOLD US THAT DAY TOO. WHICH BRINGS IT TO A PERSPECTIVE. THAT THAT WE NEED TO MOVE FORWARD AND TRY TO WRITE SOME OF THESE WRONG SEN. AND PORTRAY OUR HISTORY ACCURATELY AND NOT AS IT IS AND A LOT OF THE TEXTBOOKS. THAT WE SAW THIS MORNING ON SOME OF THE- PRESENTATIONS THAT CAME THIS MORNING. AND WE ARE ESPECIALLY GRATEFUL TO CHAIRPERSON ROSS. FOR INTERVENING IN THIS PROCESS. AND BRING THE FULL IMPACT OF THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. STARTING WITH EDUCATION AND MOVING INTO OTHER OTHER AREAS AND THEN BRING IT TO THE FULL ATTENTION OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSEMBLY SO WE'D LIKE TO THANK YOU I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR DOING THAT. LIKE LIKE THE CHAIRMAN SAID MY NAME IS JAMES ARE ASSIGNED TO DO ELECTED PRESIDENT ARAMBULA INDIAN TRIBES- I AM ENROLLED MEMBER OF THE RIVAL INDIAN TRIBES. AND I HAVE A- OF WELKE AND I'M LUCKY TO SENT. I WORK FOR A TRIBE IN EDUCATION AND HEALTH CARE FOR NEARLY THIRTY YEARS AND- IT'S BEEN A REWARDING AND CHALLENGING BOTH. I'D LIKE TO START BY TALKING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE HISTORY BECAUSE I KNOW A LOT OF OUR- OUR LEGISLATIVE FOLKS- DON'T REALLY KNOW ABOUT WITH OF OUR HISTORY CAME ABOUT. SO THE HISTORY OF OUR VALLEY. AND WHAT HAD RANDOMLY HAS BEEN THE HEART OF THE U. K. TERRY TERRITORY QUOTE UNQUOTE SINCE TIME BEGAN. THE ACCUSED OF THE YOU COULD PEOPLE HAVE LIVED IN THEIR ANCESTRAL HOMELAND STRETCHING FROM HOMA BAY TO THE UPPER RIVER RUSSIAN RIVER AREA. FOR OVER TWELVE THOUSAND YEARS. PRIOR TO OTHER TRIBES. COMING INTO THE AREA AND THEN OF COURSE- WESTWARD MOVEMENT AND- CONTACT WITH THE OTHER- THE DOMINANT SOCIETY. SO THE HISTORY OF THE ROUND BUILDING AND TRIBES ARAMBULA INDIAN TRIBES IS THE FEATHER RECOGNIZED TRIBE. BEGINNING AS THE COUPLE INDIAN COMMUNITY. ARAMBULA EIGHT TRIBES IS A CONFEDERATION OF TRIBES THE YUKI WELL AKKI CONCO LITTLE IT POMA. NORMAL OKAY AND PITT RIVER. THE TRIBES WERE FORCED AND RELOCATED ON TO THE LAND FORMERLY INHABITED BY THE YOU COULD TRY. THE WE ARE LOW IF YOU DON'T KNOW WE ARE LOCATED IN NORTHEASTERN MINNESOTA COUNTY OVER TOWARD THE COAST- ARE LAND BASED IS THAT NEARLY ARE APPROXIMATELY THIRTY TWO THOUSAND ACRES. AND WE'RE ONE OF THE OLDEST AND LARGEST TRIBES IN. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT OUR MEMBERSHIP IS GETTING CLOSE TO SIX THOUSAND- AN OLD NUMBERS. ARAMBULA INDIAN RESERVATION BEGAN IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY SIX AS THE NON CALL FARM AND ADMINISTRATOR EXTENSION OF THE NON LUCKY RESERVATION LOCATED ON THE NORTHEASTERN EDGE OF THE SACRAMENTO VALLEY. THERE PASSED CANADA ONE OF THE FIVE- RESERVATIONS IN CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE BY THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY TWO. THE SYSTEM OF INDIAN RESERVATIONS HAD A DUAL PURPOSE TO PROTECT INDIANS BY SEGREGATING THE HELP FROM THE SELLERS CONVERGING ON CALIFORNIA AND GREATER AND GREATER NUMBERS. AND A FREE INDIAN LAND FOR THE SELLER SAYS THEY CAME IN. AND AS THEIR- POPULATION GROWTH. WHEN THE RESERVATION WAS ESTABLISHED THE U. K. PEOPLE AS THEY CAME TO BE CALLED ARAMBULA WERE FORCED INTO A DIFFICULT AN UNUSUAL SITUATION THEIR TRADITIONAL HOMEOWNERS NOT COMPLETELY TAKEN OVER BY SELLERS AS IN OTHER PARTS OF CALIFORNIA INSTEAD A SMALL PART OF IT WAS RESERVED. CALL THE RESERVATION. ESPECIALLY FOR THE USE AS WELL AS USE OF OTHER INDIANS WHO WERE- FORCEFULLY IF LOCATED IN THAT AREA AS WELL- MANY WHO MAY NOT. I HAD WRITTEN DOWN ENEMIES BUT I HESITATE TO USE THAT WORD BECAUSE IT DOES- KIND OF A REACTION HOW TRIBES GOT ALONG AND I HAVE A TOTALLY DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE ON THAT SOME IMAGES SAID THAT MANY OF WITH THE OTHER TRIBES WHO BABY THEY DIDN'T SEE EYE TO EYE ON A DAILY. BASIS HI HUH. SO ANYWAY AND THAT'S JUST- IT GOES THAT ARE AREAS. THE IF YOU HAD TO SHARE THEIR HOME WITH STRANGERS WHO SPOKE OTHER LANGUAGES LIVED OTHER. LIVES WITH OTHER BELIEFS AND WHO USE THE LAND. AND ITS PRODUCT DIFFERENTLY. THE OTHER TRIBES THAT CAME AROUND EARLY AS THEY DID. TWO OTHER RESERVATIONS BY FORCE THE WORD DR WIDELY USED AT THE TIME. IS A DESCRIPTIVE OF THE PRACTICE OF ROUNDING UP INDIANS AND DRIVING THEM LIKE CATTLE. TO THE RESERVATIONS WHERE THEY WERE CORRALLED BY HIGH PICKET FENCES AND SURROUNDED BY THE- THE CALVARY TOWERS STATIONED THERE. SAID STRIDES TOOK PLACE IN ALL WEATHER AND SEASONS AND THE ELDERLY ELDERLY AND SICK OFTEN DID NOT SURVIVE. THE NON CALL LOCK IS AN ANNUAL RE ENACTMENT OF ONE OF THESE DRIVES AS- WE KNOW ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS ONE IS THE- TRAIL OF TEARS WITH THE CHEROKEES. ONE ARE RIGHT WHEN WE STARTED THIS YEARS AGO MY GRANDMOTHER WAS STILL ALIVE. AND I TOOK HERS HI HOUSE OVERHEARD HER SPEAKING WITH ANOTHER TRIBAL ELDER. AND WHAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT WAS THEY SAID THIS IS ONE FORCED RELOCATION. AND THERE'S MANY MORE THAT THAT HAS OCCURRED. BUT WE DO THIS TO HONOR OUR PEOPLE THAT CAME BEFORE US AND TO- TO ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR SACRIFICE THAT THAT THEY- FOR TRADE. IN AND BEING DRIVEN IN BUT BEING BUT BEING SURVIVORS TO SURVIVE SURVIVING THROUGH THESE HARDSHIPS. IN PARTICULAR THE LOCAL LAW- MANY MANY INDIANS DIED THE WEATHER BEING DRIVEN OVER THE MOUNTAIN OF THE MINNESOTA NATIONAL FOREST. SIR FROM YEARS OF INTERMARRIAGES COMMON LIFESTYLE AND I SHARED LAND BASED A UNIFIED COMMUNITY HAS EMERGED. IN NINETEEN THIRTY SIX UNDER THE INDIAN REORGANIZATION ACT THIS DESCENDANTS OF THE U. K. E. Y. LUCKY CON KALIKA MALL. I'M A LUCKY AND PITT RIVER FORMED A NEW TRIBE ON THE RESERVATION THROUGH THE ADOPTION OF A CONSTITUTION AND CREATED THE COLVILLE INDIAN COMMUNITY. LATER TO BE CALLED ARAMBULA INDIAN TRIBES. OUR HERITAGE IS A RICH COMBINATION OF DIFFERENT CULTURES WITH A COMMON RESERVATION EXPERIENCE AND HISTORY. RODELINDA TRIBE IS FAIRLY NEW CAN OR TRAVEL DYNAMICS. AS I JUST MENTIONED THE MANY TRIBES THAT ARE THERE HUNDRED FEDERAL RECOGNITION. SO IT'S TAKEN YEARS AND YEARS OF TRYING TO WORK TOGETHER TO CREATE A STABLE- TRIBAL GOVERNMENT. AND ESTABLISHOUR TRAVEL PROGRAMS TO DELIVER SERVICES TO OUR PEOPLE INCLUDING OUR OUR- RUNDELL INDIAN HEALTH CENTER LOCATED ON A RESERVATION. SO I JUST WANTED TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND ON- WHERE- WE ARE AND WHERE WE ARE. AND THEN I'D LIKE TO MAKE A FEW COMMENTS NOW ON THE HASTINGS LAW INITIATIVE. THE HASTINGS LINE INSTEAD OF. WELL THE INTENT OF THE HASTINGS LINUS SHOULD HAVE HAS BEEN TO BRING AWARENESS MAY COMMENCE AND DECIDE HOW TO MAKE UP FOR HISTORICAL WRONGS COMMITTED BY THE FOUNDER OF HASTINGS LAW SCHOOL. SARAN ESSAY STINGS. THE HASTINGS LINE INSTEAD OF HAS BROUGHT MANY ISSUES TO THE SURFACE IN OUR TRAVEL COMMUNITY. THE ROUND VALLEY INDIAN TRIBES WORK DILIGENTLY TO ADDRESS THE ONGOING EFFECTS. OF HISTORICAL TRAUMA. AND NATURALLY WE WANT TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE IN A MANNER THAT WILL CONTINUE TO PROMOTE WELL BEING. AND HEALING FOR COMMUNITY OR COMMUNITY MEMBERS. ARAMBULA INDIAN TRIBES HAS BEEN ADVISED AND GUIDED BY THE LEADERSHIP OF THE SOME OF OUR ALMOST. TOO NOT JUST PARTICIPATE IN THE NAME CHANGE. OF A LAW SCHOOL BUT TO TAKE THE TIME TO TELL THE STORY OF OUR NATIVE PEOPLE. IN ROUND VALLEY AREA AND IN ALL CALIFORNIA. OUR STORY INCLUDES THE TO OUR STORY INCLUDES THE GENOCIDE AND ANNIHILATION OF OUR WAY OF LIFE. BUT THAT'S NOT THE STORY OF THE NATIVE PEOPLE. AND CALIFORNIA TRIBES. ARE STORIES BEGIN WITH OUR CREATION. SKEWS ME OUR STORIES ARE LANGUAGES CUSTOMS AND CULTURES ARE WHAT DEFINE US AS A DISTINCT ETHNIC GROUPS. OUR LEGAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE UNITED STATES IS WHAT DEFINES STRIDES A SOVEREIGN NATIONS. QUITE OBVIOUSLY EACH IS AN IMPORTANT DISTINCTION BUT OUR ETHNIC IDENTITY WAS DEFINED HUNDREDS OF YEARS BEFORE CONTACT WITH EUROPEANS AND WESTWARD EXPANSION OF THE UNITED STATES. ANOTHER KIND OF SUB ISSUE IS IN SEPTEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE A GROUP OF SENATORS AND REPRESENTATIVES. REEMERGES THE TRUTH AND HEALING COMMISSION OF INDIAN BOARDING SCHOOL POLICIES THE UNITED STATES WHICH WE'VE HEARD MORE DETAILS THIS MORNING ON THE AND THE- PRESENTATIONS. BUT THIS WOULD ESTABLISH A COMMISSION TO INVESTIGATE DOCUMENT AND THE KNOWLEDGE PASSENGERS THIS IS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S INDIAN BOARDING SCHOOL POLICIES. WE EXPERIENCED IN ROUND VALLEY THE SAME TYPES OF ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN TALKED ABOUT THIS MORNING OF CHILDREN BEING FORCIBLY REMOVED- AS WE SAW WITH SOME OF THE QUOTES. THIS MORNING ON THE PRESENTATIONS THEY'RE PEOPLE THAT WERE INVOLVED WITH THAT FELT THAT THAT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. AND THAT THAT WAS TRYING TO CIVILIZE THESE BARBARIC PEOPLE THOUGHT THEY LOOK AT US AS INDIAN PEOPLE. SO THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S NOT JUST WHEN WE THINK ABOUT IT IS NOT JUST FIVE HUNDRED YEARS AGO THAT'S THAT'S IN THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS THAT'S OUR OUR GRANDPARENTS. MAYBE PERHAPS GREAT GRANDPARENTS IN SOME CASES ARE PARENTS. SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT REALLY- HITS HOME WITH US. IT IS THE HOPE OF AROUND BILLION IN SIZE OF THE HASTINGS LANA SHIVERS WILL INSPIRE AND EQUALLY IMPORTANT CAMPAIGN. TO TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT ALL ASPECTS OF WHAT THE NATIVE. PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA DURING THE CONTACT PERIOD. AND POSTCOLONIALISM. ISN'T THIS INITIATIVE HAS THE POTENTIAL TO RE WRITE HISTORY BOOKS AND BRING ABOUT A TRUTH THAT MAY BRING IMPORTANT MEANINGFUL CHANGES. TO WHAT IS KNOWN ABOUT THE SETTLERS THAT CAME TO CALIFORNIA IN SEARCH OF GOLD. AND WE HURT WITH THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF MANIFEST DESTINY. THE FUNDAMENTAL GOAL ON BEHALF OF THE RUN BUILDING ENTRANCES TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS INITIATIVE PROCESS WHICH TRANSPARENCY TRANSPARENCY. AND INTEGRITY. AND THE PRIMARY FOCUS ON HEALING AND THE TRUTH TELLING ACCURATE TRUTH TELLING. OF WHAT HAPPENED TO OUR PEOPLE. IN ORDER FOR US TO CONTINUE ALONG THE HEALING PROCESS THIS HAS TO HAPPEN IN THAT MANNER. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAPPENED AT THE COUNCIL LEVEL AT THE REVEL INTO TO OUR ATTENTION WE STARTED HAVING DISCUSSIONS ABOUT MEETING WITH THE HASTINGS- FOLKS. AND COLLEGE BOOKS AND STUFF BOARD MEMBERS WAS THAT- I FELT VERY STRONGLY PERSONALLY THAT WE DO HAVE YOU FEW FOLKS THAT. CAN SPEAK ON THEIR BEHALF AND CAN PORTRAY THE ACTOR HISTORY ON THEIR OWN BEHALF. SO THE COUNCIL- SANCTIONED UP COMMITTEE TO MEET WITH THE HOSTING PEOPLE THE LEGACY- OR START OF JUSTICE. AND SO THAT WAS DONE BY- A COUNCIL RESOLUTION AND THE REASON I FELT VERY STRONGLY THAT IS ABOUT THAT FACT IS WE HAVE TO LADIES HERE TODAY. THAT ARE VERY CAPABLE OF TALKING ABOUT THEIR TRIBES AND THEIR HISTORIES I WILL HAPPEN TO THEM. ANNA AND THEIR STORIES SO- SO THE COUNCIL DID APPROVE THAT AND WE ARE MOVING AHEAD WITH THAT SO WE WENT THROUGH I JUST WANNA MAKE ONE QUICK QUICK COMMENT ABOUT THAT. SO WE'VE GONE THROUGH ALL OF THE- STORMING INFORMING AND NORMING. MOST COMMITTEES GO THROUGH. AND SO- BUT THAT'S YOU KNOW THE WAY IT GOES AND IT TAKES A LITTLE BIT OF TIME TO PULL THINGS TOGETHER. AND TO- DEFINE YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE REALLY WORKING TOWARDS AND DEFINE OUR COMMON GOALS TOGETHER. AND SO IT'S BEEN A PROCESS AND WE'RE STILL GOING THROUGH THAT PROCESS- LET ME SEE. THE FUNDAMENTALS SO THE FUNDAMENTAL ON BEHALF OF THE REVELERS TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS INITIATIVE PROCESS WHAT'S TRANSPIRED IN INTEGRITY AND THE PRIMARY FOCUS ON HEALING AND TRUTH TELLING HOW THIS OCCURS THE PENCIL ALL OF US THAT ARE INVOLVED. THE RAVALLI- DO YOU COULD TRAVEL MEMBERS THE RAVALLI COUNCIL- HASTINGS LAW GROUP YOU KNOW WE'RE STILL COMING TOGETHER ON THESE ISSUES- WHICH WE'VE- WORKED INTO- THE PROCESS THAT WE'RE CALLING INITIATIVES. AND IS IT JUST TAKES TIME IT TAKES TIME TO IDENTIFY THIS- ATTENTIONAL WAYS THAT WE COULD PARTNER AND HOW WE WORK- WITH EACH OTHER ADD TO FOR COMMON GOALS AND TO CREATE SOME TYPE OF- RESOLUTION AND SOLUTIONS TO THESE ISSUES THAT ARE COMING UP. BUT DURING THIS TIME WHEN I'M TALKING ABOUT- COMING TOGETHER AND STORMING AND NORMING AND PERFORMING- AND WORKING TOGETHER- IT HAS CREATED- KIDDING. ALL THESE THINGS POINT TO A MUCH DEEPER. DEEPER ISSUES OF UNRESOLVED GRIEF THE PAIN OF MULTI GENERATIONAL TRAUMA. AND A TRIBAL TRIBAL COMMUNITY FIND BY ITS HISTORY OF COLONIZATION. NOW THAT THESE WOUNDS HAVE BEEN RESURRECTED. WE UNDERSTAND THAT THEY HAVE BEEN JUST BELOW THE SURFACE FOR A VERY VERY LONG TIME. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT RAVALLI TRIBES CALLS FOR ASSISTANCE IN ADDRESSING THE HARM THAT HAS THAT THIS EFFORT HAS COST. CURRENTLY ALL PARTIES OF THE NEW SHOULD HAVE IDENTIFIED THE FOLLOWING WAYS OF MAKING AMENDS FOR THE PAST ATROCITIES WHICH I JUST REFERRED TO AS THE INITIATIVE- OF MISTER HASTINGS. WELL THIS LIST WAS CREATED WITH INPUT FROM ALL PARTIES THE TRIBE HEREBY RECOMMENDS ADDITIONAL EFFORTS TO ADDRESS THE STRUGGLE TRAUMA. OF NOT JUST THE PEOPLE BUT ALL NATIVE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. BEGIN WITH THIS MAY LOOK LIKE FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS YET TO BE DEFINED. I'D LIKE TO TAKE JUST A MOMENT TO. IT'S TO STRESS OF JUST A FEW- OF SOME OF THE BROADER ISSUES THAT WE DEAL WITH AS A TRIBE JUST TO BRING IT TO THE ATTENTION OF THIS SUBCOMMITTEE AND TO THE CALIFORNIA ASSEMBLY IN GENERAL. SO SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE DEAL WITH ON A DAILY BASIS AND- AND HAVE DEALT WITH FOR YEARS AS ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN OUR COMMUNITY. AND- ALSO IN TERMS OF JUST COMMUNICATION- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT CAME TO OF I HAD THAT WAS VERY RELEVANT. IN THE DURING THIS PANDEMIC WAS OUR CHILDREN WERE NO LONGER ALLOWED TO GO TO SCHOOL THEY WERE TOLD TO STAY HOME AND- WERE ALLOWED TO GO INTO THE CLASSROOMS. AND SO THEN THEY WERE TOLD THAT WELL YOU CAN ZOOM IN. OUR TO VARIOUS THINGS. THE PROBLEM WE HAD WITH THAT WAS WE HAD NO ACCESS. ON A RESERVATION TO- HIGH SPEED LINES- WE HAVE ONE OUTSIDE COMPANY THAT. WAS HAD- FEW COULD OR GET HIGH SPEED INTERNET BUT IT WAS A VERY HIGH SPEED. AND SO WAS AND IT CERTAINLY WASN'T- BUT NOW IF IT WASN'T SUFFICIENT FOR OUR KIDS TO LEARN. SO WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON OUR OWN ISSUES WITHIN THE VALLEY OF TRYING TO START OUR OWN. CELL TOWER SYSTEM TO GET THOSE- UP AND RUNNING AND GET OUR KIDS TO HAVE ACCESS AND OUR FOLKS TO IN THE VALLEY TO HAVE ACCESS TO. HIGH SPEED LINE HIGH SPEED LINES ANOTHER VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE FORCES EDUCATION. AND I KNOW WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT IT IN EDUCATION THERE'S A LOTOF WORK TO BE DONE. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR US. AS A TRIBE. AND AS WE MOVE FORWARD. WE HAVE ONE- LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICT IN ROUND VALLEY. AND WITHIN ABOUT THE LAST FIVE YEARS- WE HAD ABOUT 80% OF OUR LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICT WAS INDIAN KIDS. AND SO- BUT WE STILL DEAL WITH THE SAME ISSUES EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE THE LARGEST POPULATION. WE STILL DEAL WITH THE SAME ISSUES THAT YOU HEAR FROM OTHER SCHOOL DISTRICTS AS WELL. AND BASICALLY JUST TO SUM IT UP IN ONE WORD. IT'S JUST REYES RACIST IT'S BLATANT RACISM. THAT WE DEAL WITH ALMOST ON A DAILY BASIS. SO WE HAVE SOME HUGE CHALLENGES IN EDUCATION AND WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO WORK THROUGH THEM- ANOTHER ISSUE THAT I'D LIKE TO BRING TO THE ATTENTION IS- WE DO HAVE A- RIVAL INDIAN HEALTH CENTER IF THIS LOCATED ON A RESERVATION. AND IT'S ONE OF THE OLDEST HEALTH CENTERS THAT WAS AROUND TOO STARTED IN NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT. BUT ANYWAY- IN NIGHT IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT TWO THOUSAND AND NINE THE INDIAN HEALTH STATE IN HEALTH PROGRAM WAS CUT. FROM THE BUDGET ENTIRELY. AND SINCE THEN AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE HITS- DEFICIT BUDGET DEFICIT IN THE STATE NEEDED TO DO SOMETHING TO BALANCE THE BUDGET. BUT ALL OF THE PROGRAMS OTHER PROGRAMS THAT WERE CUT DURING THAT TIME WE'RE ALL HAVE ALL BEEN REINSTATED. EXCEPT FOR OUR PROGRAM. SO I KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN A BILL AND THERE'S BEEN SOME- ADVOCACY ON THE PART OF GERMAN AROUND WE'RE ALMOST ANOTHER LEGISLATORS. TO TRY TO REINSTALL THAT PROGRAM ON IT ON AN ONGOING BASIS. SO IT'S VERY IT'S CRUCIAL TO- TO OUR ENDED HEALTH. AND TO OUR COMMUNITY SO I'D REALLY LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT. THE OTHER ISSUE THAT I'D LIKE TO BRING TO YOUR ATTENTION AS THE- MMI W. MURDERED. MISSING INDIGENOUS WOMEN. SO WE HAD SET A VERY HIGH PROFILE. CASE THAT WAS BROUGHT TO THE ATTENTION OF NOT ONLY CALIFORNIA BUT PROBABLY THE COUNTRY. BUT IT HAD SOME WITH THE FOR US VERY- RIGHT TO THE CORE OF OUR HEART. AS WE HAD- ONE YOUNG LADY IN OUR COMMUNITY WAS BRUTALLY ASSAULTED. SHE'S RIGHT NOW IN UC DAVIS MEDICAL CENTER AND SO SHE IS JUST CLINGING TO LIFE SHE'S STILL ALIVE SELUK FORTUNATELY SHE WAS FOUND. BUT THIS IS ANOTHER THING THAT WE NEED TO BRING TO THE FOREFRONT ON BEHALF FOR INDIAN INDIGENOUS WOMEN. DOES THAT THIS HAPPENS FAR TOO OFTEN AND WE NEED TO COME TO SOME TYPE OF SOLUTIONS- WORKING COLLECTIVELY TOGETHER. WITH STATE GOVERNMENTS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS OF COUNTY GOVERNMENTS. TO TRY TO DO SOMETHING AND I'LL COME TO SOME RESOLUTIONS ON THIS PROBLEM TO WHICH IS AFFECTING- ALL OVER RESERVATIONS. SO I'D LIKE TO IN BY. I JUST KIND OF SUMMING UP ON. THIS WORDS THAT I'M GONNA BE TALKING ABOUT- FROM ONE OF OUR GREAT LOOK COULD OF LEADERS. I CAN FIND THEM. I THINK THIS IS KIND OF FITTING TEN WITH- THIS IS BY ONE OF OUR LOCAL LEADER SITTING BULL. LAWYERS ARE NOT WHAT YOU THINK OF AS LAWYERS THE LAWYERS NOT SOMEONE WHO FIGHTS FOR NO ONE HAS THE RIGHT TO TAKE ANOTHER LIFE. THE WARRIOR FOR US IS THE ONE WHO SACRIFICES HIMSELF FOR GOOD FOR THE GOOD OF OTHERS. HIS TASK IS TO TAKE CARE OF THE ELDERLY THE DEFENSELESS THOSE WHO CANNOT PROVIDE FOR THEMSELVES AND ABOVE ALL THE CHILDREN. THE FUTURE OF HUMANITY VERY MUCH. THANK YOU- RESEARCHERS- RUSS FOR YOUR- WERE TESTIMONY AND BRING IT TO LIFE- THE ISSUES THAT STILL PLAGUE- CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICANS AND PARTICULARLY- THE TRIBES HERE AS FAR AS THE- WHAT STILL IS GOING ON TODAY RIGHT MISS EMERGING AS SOME. WOMEN PERSONS ON FEDERAL RESERVATIONS AND OUR OUR HEART NO REFERRALS OUT TO YOUR MEMBER WHO IS IN UC DAVIS AND IN THE HOSPITAL RECOVERING FROM THOSE AREAS BUT IT SHOULDN'T BE HAPPENING STILL IN THE YEAR TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO BRING THAT ATTENTION. WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE LEGISLATURE ARE MOVING FORWARD ON TACKLING THOSE ISSUES- BROADBAND ANOTHER ISSUE OF OUR AND OUR COLLEAGUES HERE WE WORKED ON BROADBAND LAST SESSION WHERE WE INCLUDED- TRIBAL COMMUNITIES IN THAT LANGUAGE. WILL BE FORWARD BUT THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THAT AND THANK YOU TO THE TESTIMONY- MONA- FOR BRINGING FULL CIRCLE FROM YOUR OWN VOICES RIGHT THE TRUSTEES THAT HAPPENED I THINK THAT'S VERY. VERY IMPORTANT AS THIS PROCESS CONTINUES TO MOVE FORWARD AND NOW I'D LIKE TO BRING UP- DEAN- DAVID HAGEMAN FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA HASTINGS COLLEGE OF THE LAW. CHANCELLOR AND DEAN HE IS- THE JOHN DAVID A DISTINGUISHED PROFESSOR. AT THE UNIVERSITY OF. HASTINGS COLLEGE OF. AS PROFESSOR IN THE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHIATRY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IN SAN FRANCISCO. I COULD HAVE THE D. AND MOVE FORWARD. BUT AROUND MOST- FAMILY MEMBERS MATHIS AND TANG- MISTER TENDER TO SEE YOU AGAIN- I HAVE A PREPARED STATEMENT- THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE. OUR SUBJECT TODAY IS VERY IMPORTANT HOW THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND HASTINGS COLLEGE OF THE LAW SHOULD RESPOND TO THE EVILS COMMITTED BY CIVIC AND GOVERNMENT LEADERS AGAINST THE INDIGENOUS PEOPLES OF CALIFORNIA. IN THE MID NINETEEN TH CENTURY INCLUDING THE FOUNDER OF OUR LAW SCHOOLS AROUND THE SAFE THINGS. THE OF WHITE SETTLERS TREAT OF INDIGENOUS TRIBES IN CALIFORNIA. IS ONE OF BLOOD TEARS. HEARTACHE AND-MISERY. IS A HISTORY THAT I WAS LARGELY UNFAMILIAR WITH UNTIL THE FIRST YEAR OF MY REGULAR DEANSHIP. THOUGH OF COURSE SO GENERALLY FAMILIAR WITH THE ATROCITIES CARRIED OUT BY SETTLERS ACROSS NORTH AMERICA. HOWEVER SHORTLY AFTER MY DEANSHIP BEGAN IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND OP ED APPEARED IN THE SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE DETAILING THE PARTICIPATION OF TWO INDIVIDUALS IN PARTICULAR WHO HAD PRESTIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS NAMED IN THEIR HONOR. ONE WAS WE WENT STANFORD AND THE OTHER WAS OUR SCHOOLS FOUNDER SERINUS LISTINGS. THE FIRST CHIEF JUSTICE AND THE FIRST ATTORNEY GENERAL OF CALIFORNIA. AFTER SEEING THIS OP ED I READ TWO BOOKS ON THE SUBJECT THAT HAD RECENTLY BEEN PUBLISHED ONE BY BENJAMIN MADLEY AND AMERICAN GENOCIDE AND THE OTHER BY BRANDON WINS THE MURDER STATE. BOTH OF THESE BOOKS TOLD THE GRUESOME STORY OF CALIFORNIA'S PRACTICE UNDER COLOR OF LAW. OF REMOVING NATIVE AMERICANS IN CALIFORNIA FROM THEIR LAND BY WHATEVER MEANS NECESSARY INCLUDING BY KILLING AND ENSLAVING NATIVE PEOPLES. IN EACH OF THOSE BOOKS WRITERS WHO THINGS OCCUPIED TO DISCUSSION OF PARAGRAPHS. STILL HIS SUPPORT AND PROMOTION OF KILLINGS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA MADE HIM AN ACCOMPLICE TO THE GREATER CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY THAT OCCURRED IN THE EIGHTEEN FIFTIES AND BEYOND. SHORTLY AFTER READING THESE BOOKS I CONSTITUTED A COMMITTEE IN THE SPRING OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN WHAT CAME TO BE KNOWN AS THE HASTINGS LEGACY REVIEW COMMITTEE OR LEGACY COMMITTEE. TO THEM IN OUR FOUNDERS ACTIONS AND THEN AND TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO ME ABOUT THE BEST PATH FORWARD. ADDITIONALLY I F. PROFESSOR BRENDAN LINDSAY AUTHOR OF MURDER STATE. TO PREPARE A WHITE PAPER TO FURTHER RESEARCH THE SPECIFIC ACTIONS OF SERINUS HASTINGS. IN THE FOLLOWING THREE YEARS THE LEGACY COMMITTEE COMPLETED SUBSTANTIAL WORK IN PARTICULAR THE COMMITTEE CHAIRED BY THE THEN. THE HUSING BOARD OF DIRECTORS TOM GETTING HIMSELF IN INDIAN LAW EXPERTS. REACHED OUT TO SEVERAL TRIBAL GROUPS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA INCLUDING THE ROUND VALLEY INDIAN TRIBES AND THE CEO. AN INTER TRIBAL WILDERNESS COUNCIL. COMMITTEE MEMBERS SEVERAL TRIPS TO YOU KYRA AND COBLE- THE LATTER BEING THE CEO OF THE ROUND VALLEY TRIBAL COUNCIL. I HAD THE HONOR OF JOINING SEVERAL OF THESE MEETINGS IN BOTH U. KADA AND KOBYLA. OTHER THE CHARGE OF THE LEGACY COMMITTEE WAS TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE TEAM REGARDING WHAT RESTORATIVE JUSTICE EFFORT SHOULD BE CONTEMPLATED. IT SOON BECAME CLEAR THAT THE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION DEPENDED ON DEVELOPING A RELATIONSHIP WITH THE AFFECTED TRIBES OF ROUND VALLEY. IN PARTICULAR THE TRIBE GENERALLY KNOWN AS THE U. P. MANY TRIBAL MEMBERS HOWEVER ASKED US TO USE ALTERNATIVE NAMES FOR THEM SINCE YOU KEEP ORIGINALLY MEANT AN ENEMY ANOTHER TRIBE'S LANGUAGE NAME SUGGESTED TO A SEVERITY BUT INCLUDING NAM HOANG- WOULD TO COME WITH TOOK NAM AND PEOPLE EVEN AROUND. ADAM FOR THEIR WE AS WELL AS THE FUNDAMENTAL THAT EACH OF US AS SOVEREIGNS OVER OUR OWN AND OUR COLLECTIVE DESTINY YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO DECIDE FOR OURSELVES WHAT OUR NAME SHOULD BE. I SHALL REFER TO THE MOST DEEPLY AFFECTED FIVE WITH RUNNERS HE THINGS ACTIONS AS THE PEOPLE OF EDEN AND ROUND HOURS. FROM TWENTY SEVENTEEN THROUGH THE PRESIDENT THE COLLEGE HAS SOUGHT TO DEVELOP A RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR V. I. T. AS THE SOVEREIGN REPRESENTATIVE OF THE CONFEDERATION OF TRIBES OF BROWN'S OUT. AS WELL AS THE PEOPLE OF EVEN IN ROUND VALLEY. BASED ON OUR SEVERAL MEETINGS WITH TRIBAL REPRESENTATIVES AS WELL AS THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE LEGACY COMMITTEE. I NEED TO REPORT TO THE HASTINGS BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SEPTEMBER TWENTY TWENTY. IN THAT REPORT I RECOMMENDED THAT THE COLLEGE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH R. B. I. T. AND THE PEOPLE OF THE EVENING AROUND OUR USE AND FOCUS ON DEVELOPING TRUST AND FRIENDSHIP. WHICH WOULD BE THE FOUNDATION FOR RESTORATIVE OPPORTUNITIES GOING FORWARD. MY REPORT RECOMMENDED CONCENTRATING ON CONCRETE WAYS TO BUILD A PARTNERSHIP. A COLLABORATION. INDEED A FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN OUR TWO COMMUNITIES ON OUR CAMPUS I CREATED THE SUCCESSOR TO THE LEGACY COMMITTEE. BY DESIGNATING A GROUP OF STUDENTS STAFF FACULTY AND ALUMNI TO SERVE ON A DEEP CLEAN- RESTORATIVE JUSTICE ADVISORY BOARD BUT YOU COME KNOWN AS OUR JOB. HOW DIFFERENTIALS CONTINUED TO MEET DURING THIS TIME WITH TRIBAL MEMBERS BUT IN PERSON MEETING FOR LIMITED BY BOTH THE GLOBAL COVERT PANDEMIC AND WILDFIRES THAT RAGED ACROSS ROUND VALLEY. NONE THE LESS THE COUCHES MOVE FORWARD ON A NUMBER OF INITIATIVES INCLUDING DESIGNATING A SPACE IN THE LOBBY OF OUR MAIN ADMINISTRATION BUILDING MARY KAY CAN HALL TO COMMEMORATE THE HISTORY AND EXPERIENCES OF THE PEOPLE OF EATING AROUND VALERIE'S. WE WERE GIVEN A GIFT OF TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS FROM AN ALARM TO SUPPORT THE GATHERING OF NARRATIVE. FROM TRIBAL ELDERS WHICH COULD BE WHICH COULD BE ARCHIVED IN OUR LIBRARY AND SHARED WITH OUR STUDENTS IN THE COMMEMORATIVE SPACE. IN TWENTY TWENTY RECREATED THE INDIGENOUS LAWCENTER LED BY PROFESSOR JOE CARILLO. THE INDIGENOUS LAWCENTER HAS BEEN VERY ACTIVE. IN INVITING DISTINGUISHED VISITING SCHOLARS IN INDIAN LAW AND WORKING WITH THE RAHMATULLAH SALONI ON WHOSE ANCESTRAL LANDS THE COLLEGES SITUATED TO DRAFT A LANDED KNOWLEDGE MINT. THIS YEAR THE COUCHES FUNDED FOR SUMMER GRANTS FOR STUDENTS TO WORK WITH LEGAL AID AND TRIBAL COURTS SERVING THE INDIGENOUS PEOPLES OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. INCLUDING THE TRIBES AROUND OUR HIGHLIGHT THAT THE COUCH HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN DEFINING AND CARRYING OUT RESTORATIVE JUSTICE EFFORTS WITH OUR V. I. T. AND THE PEOPLE HERE IN ROUND VALLEY FOR OVER FOUR YEARS FOR THE SCHOOL THIS IS A MATTER OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE. BOTH IN TERMS OF WHAT A LAW SCHOOL MIGHT DO IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE TRIBES AROUND VALLEY AS WELL AS HOW OUR STUDENTS CAN BENEFIT BY LEARNING THE HISTORY OF NINETEENTH CENTURY CALIFORNIA. AND THE START OF OUR EFFORTS IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND INDEED IN THE TITLE TO THE OP ED MENTIONED ABOVE. THE QUESTION OF WHETHER HE SINGS HIS NAME SHOULD BE CONTINUED TO BE A FIX TO OUR GREAT LAW SCHOOL. HAS BEEN PART OF THE CONVERSATION. THE LEGACY COMMITTEE CONSIDERED IT AND RECOMMENDED THAT FOR THE TIME BEING RESTORATIVE JUSTICE EFFORTS TO BE THE FOCUS OF OUR WORK. IN MY REPORT TO THE BOARD. I TO RECOMMENDED KEEPING THE FOCUS ON RESTORATIVE JUSTICE- REDWOOD RESTORATIVE JUSTICE EFFORTS AND NOT SEEKING YOUR NAME FAN. HEY SAFE WATER DIRECTORS ACCEPTED THAT INITIAL RECOMMENDATION UNANIMOUSLY. OVER THESE FOUR PLUS YEARS THE ISSUE OF CHANGING THE NAME OF THE SCHOOL HAS BEEN COMPLICATED THE NUMBER OF WAYS. THE COLLEGES COMMUNITY WAS DEEPLY DIVIDED ON THE MATTER IN CONVERSATIONS WITH TRIBAL LEADERS THEY TO INDICATED THE DESIRE TO EMPHASIZE RESTORATIVE EFFORTS AND WAY FOR US TO BUILD TRUST AND A CONTINUING GROUP CONTINUING FRIENDSHIP. IN OUR IN PERSON MEETING WITH THE PEOPLE OF YOU AROUND THE HOUSE IN AUGUST TWENTY TWENTY ONE IN SAN FRANCISCO THE ISSUE THE NAME WAS DISCUSSED AT SOME LENGTH BUT AGAIN IT WAS A FAIR DEGREE OF DIVISION AMONG THE ASSEMBLED. OF COURSE THE ISSUE THE SCHOOL'S NAME IS DEEPLY COMPLICATED BY THE FACT THAT HOW DOES A STATUTORY. AND CONSTITUTIONAL ENTITY AND DOES NOT HAVE UNILATERAL POWER TO CHANGE ITS NAME. CHANGING THE NAME IS NOT THAT STRAIGHTFORWARD OR SIMPLE MATTER. IN ANY CASE FOLLOWING THE NEW YORK TIMES STORE LEFTOVER TWENTY EIGHTH TWENTY TWENTY ONE. ENTITLED SCHOOL FACES FOUNDERS ROLE IN NATIVE KILLINGS. THE ISSUE THE COLLEGE'S NAME BECAME A NATIONAL ISSUE. AS WE HAVE FOUND THROUGHOUT THESE PAST FOUR YEARS THE DEBATE ABOUT THAT NAME SHOULD SOON ALL OTHER CONVERSATIONS INTENSE UNDERMINE SUFFER THAT FOR TO BUILD LASTING RELATIONSHIPS IN FURTHERANCE OF RESTORATIVE JUSTICE. ANY CONVERSATIONS WITH SENIOR LEADERS AT THE COLLEGE AS WELL AS MEMBERS OF THE HOUSTON FORTY DIRECTORS I BROUGHT TO THE BOARD THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THE COLLEGE SHOULD SEEK LEGISLATION TO CHANGE THE NAME OF THE SCHOOL. IN DECEMBER THIS PAST DECEMBER THE HAITIAN BORDER DIRECTORS VOTED UNANIMOUSLY TO DIRECT ME TO WORK WITH LEGISLATORS AND THE GOVERNOR TO CHANGE THE NAME. SINCE THAT TIME WE HAVE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF MEETING WITH ASSEMBLYMEMBERS RAMOS AND TANG. SENATOR WIENER OTHER LEGISLATORS ELECTED LEADERSHIP OF OUR V. I. T. AND MEMBERS OF THE PEOPLE EVEN AROUND VALUES DISCUSS HOW BEST TO MOVE FORWARD. THERE TWO FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES THAT NOW FACE CALIFORNIA LAWMAKERS. THE FIRST IS WHETHER THE NAME HASTINGS SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM THE CALLING. THE CROWDED BOARD OF DIRECTORS IS NOTED VOTED UNANIMOUSLY TO DO SO AND WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS NOW THE RIGHT COURSE FOR THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE TO. THIS APPEARS TO BE A VIEW SHARED BY OUR V. I. T. pROUND OUT. THE QUESTION RESOLVED DOWN TO WHETHER IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY A GREAT LAW SCHOOL SHOULD CONTINUE TO HONOR TO ANTICIPATE THINGS. AFTER LEARNING OF HIS ACT PROMOTING THE KILLING OF CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICANS IN THE LATE EIGHTEEN FIFTIES WE BELIEVE THAT THE ANSWER IS CLEAR. THAT IT SHOULD NOT. THE SECOND ISSUE IS WHAT SHOULD BE THE NAME OF THE SCHOOL GOING FORWARD. THE COLLEGES BOARD OF DIRECTORS VOTED UNANIMOUSLY IN A SECOND MEETING IN DECEMBER TO RECOMMEND TO THE LEGISLATURE IF YOU SAN FRANCISCO TO DESIGNATE THE SCHOOL. THIS IS THE SCHOOL'S REQUEST WHICH IS BASED ON NUMEROUS CONSIDERATIONS INCLUDING. FIRST THE COLLEGE HAS BEEN IN SAN FRANCISCO FROM ITS FOUNDING FOR NOW OVER ONE HUNDRED FORTY FOUR YEARS IS LOCATED IN THE HEART OF THE CITY. WITHIN URBAN CAMPS- CAMPUS IT OVERLOOKS CITY HALL IT IS WITHIN BLOCKS OF VIRTUALLY EVERY CITY STATE AND NATIONAL AGENCIES IN COURT. THE SCHOOL IS THEN IS VAST UNIQUELY ASSOCIATED. WITH THE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO. SECONDLY UNIFORM AND DEFAULT DESIGNATION FOR ALL UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY CAMPUSES IS THERE GEOGRAPHIC HOME. THIRD THESE TO SAN FRANCISCO ON THE COLLEGE'S NAME IS SUPPORTED BY PRESIDENT MICHAEL DRAKE OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND SEN AND CHANCELLOR SAM HOLD THE OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO. IF WE RETURN THIRD FOURTH IF WE RETURN TO EIGHTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT AND SURRENDERS HASTINGS WITH HAD NOT BESTOWED HIS NAME ON THE SCHOOL THE COLLEGE AS THE FIRST LAW DEPARTMENT OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA WOULD MOST LIKELY HAVE BEEN NAMED. UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA COLLEGE OF THE LAW SAN FRANCISCO. AND FIFTH AND FINAL THIS HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED REPEATEDLY IN CONVERSATIONS WITH PEOPLE EDEN AND RANTAU IS A FIRST PRINCIPLE OF SOVEREIGNTY WHETHER IT'S A PERSON OR AS A COMMUNITY IS TO CHOOSE BY WHAT NAME YOU WISH TO THE CALL. WE WISH THE DIFFERENCE WILL BE HONORED IN THE CASE OF OUR GREAT LAW SCHOOL. HE THINKS HOW TO THE LAW HAS A RICH AN HONOR HISTORY. ITS GRADUATES INCLUDE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT JUSTICES FEDERAL AND STATE LEGISLATORS. US ATTORNEYS AND DISTRICT ATTORNEYS PUBLIC DEFENDERS AND DEFENSE COUNSEL. OTHER DISTINGUISHED MEMBERS OF THE LEGAL PROFESSION AND THE CURRENT THREAT THE CURRENT VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. AS A SCHOOL WE ARE DEDICATED TO CONTINUING RESTORATIVE JUSTICE EFFORTS. THAT BENEFIT BOTH OUR COMMUNITY AND THE INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES AROUND VALLEY AND IDEAL WAY INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE. THESE EFFORTS WERE FREELY EMBRACE MORE THAN FOUR YEARS AGOAND WILL CONTINUE INTO THE FUTURE WE WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH CALIFORNIA LEGISLATORS THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND THE TRIBES AND PEOPLES AROUND AROUND VOWED TO REMOVE THE NAME HASTINGS. FROM THE COLLEGE AND BEGIN A NEW CHAPTER IN THE DISTINGUISHED HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA COLLEGE OF THE LAW SAN FRANCISCO. THIS IS BEEN A JOURNEY OF GROWTH AND LEARNING. I UNDERSTAND THE NEW WAVE THE IMPASSABLE AT THIS STORE COULD TRAUMA AND OF HEALING. I AM GRATEFUL TO PRESIDENT RUSS FOR HIS FRIENDSHIP AND HIS PARTNERSHIP. I'M ALSO HUMBLED AND THANKFUL FOR THE FRIENDSHIP AND TRUST TO THE PEOPLE. OF EVEN VALLEY WHO HAVE COME TO KNOW. AMONG THEM ARE THE MCDOWELL A. P. DOING FAMILY FARM ON THE TO READ A STATEMENT FROM THEM NOW. FROM THE DALLES AND PETE AND FAMILY WHO ARE- DESCENDANTS OF EVEN VALLEY. HERE ON A BOAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER JAMES RAMOS AS WE ADDRESS THE MATTER THE NAME CHANGE OF HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW LET US FIRST ADDRESS OUR OWN NAME. AS DIRECT DESCENDANTS OF THE WOOD WITH THE TOP TOOK NON PEOPLE OF UC'S THE MAHANE KNOWN TODAY AS YOU'D BE THE WORD YUKI MEANS ENEMY AND WE ARE AND WILL CONTINUE TO ACQUIRE THIS NOW IN THE FUTURE THAT WE ARE NOT YOUR ENEMY.

KNOWN TODAY AS EVEN VALLEY. WE RECOGNIZE OUR INHERENT SOVEREIGN RIGHT FROM OUR CREATOR TO THIS PLAN AND HELP BRING FORGIVENESS OR REDEMPTION TO THE VICTIMS AND THE PERPETRATORS. WITH THIS FORGIVENESS WE WALKING THE FREEDOM AND BLESSING GIVEN BY OUR CREATOR TO ASK THAT THE NAME HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW AND THE BOARD FEET OF THE AIR OF SERENITY HASTINGS. REMAIN IN PLACE. IT IS THIS FORGET THAT WE CAN BRING REAL TRUTH AND HEALING TO OUR PEOPLE AND TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THIS ACTOR FORGIVENESS HOPE THIS MOVE TOWARDS RECONCILIATION RESTORATION ENSURING THAT THERE IS JUSTICE AND LIBERATION OF OUR PEOPLE. WE KNOW THAT THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING OF THE PROCESS BUT WE MUST FIRST AND FOREMOST START WITH THE FOUNDATION OF OUR EXISTENCE. AT THE END THERE WRITER I THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME TODAY IN YOUR ATTENTION.

DEAN FIGMENT IN THE IN THE HASTINGS LEADERSHIP BOTH THE ALUMNI THE FACULTY FOR REALLY TAKING A HARD LOOK AT THIS ISSUE AND REALLY GOING THROUGH A VERY THOUGHTFUL PROCESS AS TO WHAT SHOULD BE DONE. GOT TO OFTEN WE HAVE INSTITUTIONS WITH THEIR HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS OR GOVERNMENT INSTITUTIONS OR COMPANIES REALLY LOOK THE OTHER WAY TRYING TO BRUSH HISTORY UNDER THE RUG AND I REALLY DO APPRECIATE YOUR KNOWLEDGE MENT OF WHAT HAPPENED- AND REALLY YOUR- BEING VERY OPEN ABOUT DISCUSSING THE HISTORY IT'S YOU KNOW HAVING EVERYBODY SPEAK TODAY- THE FIRST. THE FIRST THING I THINK OF IS ALL THE PAIN THAT HAS BEEN CAUSING ALL THE PAIN THAT PEOPLE FEEL IT'S EVEN DUE TO IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO EVEN TALK ABOUT IT WHETHER IT'S WHETHER YOU'RE THE LAW SCHOOL OR THE- THE TRIBAL LEADERS- AND TO TALK ABOUT THE GENOCIDE BUT- WHAT WE'VE LEARNED IS IF WE DON'T. TALK ABOUT HISTORY. WE DON'T ACKNOWLEDGE IT WE DON'T. OWN IT- THE WE REFER. AND SO I. HAVING SITTING HERE TODAY AND HE- FROM THE VARIOUS PARTIES INVOLVED THE FACT THAT. THERE IS NO DISAGREEMENT ABOUT WHETHER WE SHOULD CHANGE THE NAME OF THE OF THE SCHOOL OF LAW. REALLY THE ONLY QUESTION IS WHAT WE CHANGE IT TO AND I REALLY APPRECIATE ALL THE- ALL THE DISCUSSION AND ALL THE OUR PROCESS I THINK WE'RE WE ARE STILL TAKING TIME- OUR CHAIRMAN HERE IS REALLY BRINGING ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS TOGETHER AND I HOPE. THAT AS WE CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS THROUGH THIS YEAR THAT WE CAN COME TO SOME RESOLUTION THAT WE COULD ALL. BE VERY VERY PROUD OF I THINK- I FIND AT THE RESPECT THE WISHES OF THE BOARD BUT I ALSO DO RESPECT THE WISHES OF THE TRIBAL LEADERS WHO I WANT TO SEE SOME ACKNOWLEDGEMENT- WITHIN THE NAME. OF WHAT HAS HAPPENED AND I HOPE AND I'M VERY CONFIDENT THAT OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS SO WE CAN. COME TO AGREEMENT TO BE MY AGREEMENT I REALLY FEEL THAT I CAN THIS ROOM TODAY THERE'S OF KNOWLEDGE MINT OF WHAT HAPPENED THERE'S AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT HAPPENED. AND THERE'S KNOWLEDGE AND THAT HE WAS WRONG- THE AND THERE'S NO ONE JUST. THE OR- TRYING TO- A- A WHITEWASH HISTORY AS AS TOO OFTEN HAPPENS.

THAT WE HAVE OPEN UP TESTIMONIES- I AM APPALLED BYE BY WHAT I HEARD- BECAUSE I'VE ALWAYS REFLECTED BACK ON- YOU KNOW BLACK PEOPLE AFRICAN AMERICANS PEOPLE- IN SLAVERY AND CERTAINLY. IN THIS COUNTRY HAS A VERY CHECKERED PAST WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO PEOPLE OF COLOR BUT WE MUST BE. AT LEAST IN THE THIS POSITION AS POLICYMAKERS TRY TO RE WRITE THE WRONGS OF WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE PAST- SO THAT WE CAN MOVE ON AND I THINK THE WAY WE MOVE ON IS TO. RENAME THIS INSTITUTION AND I THINK THAT IT'S REFLECTIVE OF A COLLABORATION. OF MANY VOICES BUT MOST OF ALL OF THE FOR THE FIRST AMERICANS OF VOICES WHICH IS MOST IMPORTANT IS A NATIVE AMERICAN VOICES. OUT TO MAKING SURE THAT IS SOMETHING THAT- THEY CAN BE PROUD OF- IT CAN MAKE SURE THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES AND CALIFORNIA COULD BE PROUD OF. BECAUSE I THINK WE STAND AT A TIME. WHERE WE HAVE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO I GREW UP WITH- THAT THAT- WERE SINCE SLAVE MY PEOPLE- THAT. THE SITES TO OTHER PEOPLE OF COLOR- AND WE CANNOT LOOK AT THOSE STATUES THOSE MONUMENTS AND FEEL GOOD ABOUT OURSELVES AND I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE. ARTICULATED HOW MANY WELL KNOWN PEOPLE HAVE GRADUATED AND WENT THROUGH HASTINGS LAW SCHOOL AND THAT'S ALL AND WELL AND WE APPRECIATE THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO PROVIDE GREAT LEADERSHIP- BUT. THIS INSTITUTION OF HIGHER LEARNING IT SHOULD REFLECT- THAT THE- A PROUD PEOPLE OF PEOPLE WHO LOST A TREMENDOUS. AMOUNT OF PEOPLE- IN THIS COUNTRY. DUE TO RACISM AND DISCRIMINATION AND TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT REFLECTS- PEOPLE THAT CAN FEEL PROUD OF GOING THERE- AND NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE PAST I THINK IS THE RIGHT STEP TO DISS TO TAKEN SO AGAIN- MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU FOR YOUR GREAT LEADERSHIP BECAUSE HAD YOU NOT BEEN ELECTED.

WE HAVE THE HIGHEST POPULATION OF NATIVE AMERICANS LIVING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO IT'S MY PLEASURE TO INTRODUCE PANEL THREE. PANEL THREE WHO WILL DISCUSS THE NEED AND ROLE OF TRIBAL COLLEGES AND THE CALIFORNIA INDIAN NATIONS COLLEGE EFFORTS TO GAIN FEDERAL ACCREDITATION AND WHY THEY ARE IMPORTANT WE HAVE- THERESA MIKE HONORABLE THERESA MIKE WHO WAS BORN AND RAISED AND ALLOW ME NATION IN WASHINGTON STATE MISS MIGHT WORK. THROUGH A COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND LATER THE LEMME INDIAN SCHOOL OF AQUACULTURE- WHILE RAISING A FAMILY MAINTAINING HER CULTURE AND SERVING IN TRIBAL GOVERNMENT IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTY SHE HELPED LEAD THE TRANSITION OF THE LEASE UP TO ALLOW ME COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND HELP SEE IT THROUGH TO ACCREDITATION. AND IN THIS TRANSLATE TRANSITION TO THE NORTHWEST INDIAN COLLEGE AS IT EXPANDED SO MANY IN THE NORTHWEST UP IN THE WASHINGTON AREA. MISS MIKE LEAD TO FURTHER EXPAND UPON HER PREVIOUS WORK- WHICH LED TO FOUNDING THE CALIFORNIA INDIAN NATIONS COLLEGE. WHICH THE TWENTY NINE PALM BANDS OF BAND OF MISSION INDIANS TRAVEL GOVERNMENT CHARTED IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN. SHE WILL BE JOINING US WITH VIRTUALLY AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT SHE'S ABLE TO JOIN. AS A AS SHE GETS READY TO GO ON I WANTED TO JUST ADD. TO THAT- BIOGRAPHY. SHE WAS THE TWENTY TWENTY AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WOMAN OF THE YEAR IN THE ASSEMBLY DISTRICT THAT I GET TO REPRESENT THE COACHELLA VALLEY SUGGEST ONE PUT A CHERRY ON TOP OF THE- BIOGRAPHY INTRODUCTION THAT'S- JUST THE CHERRY. AND I WOULD ABLE TO BRING A RUBBER SHE COULD HEAR YOU. OKAY GOOD GOOD- GOOD MORNING EVERYBODY AND I'D LIKE TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO THANK YOU FOR LISTENING TO WHAT I HAVE TO SAY- AND I'VE BEEN IN EDUCATION- FOR MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS- R. AS- MISTER ROBERTS STATED IT WAS WORKING AFTER MY MEETING- AND HELPED ESTABLISH NORTHWEST INDIAN COLLEGE FOR ABOUT FOURTEEN YEARS. AND CONTINUED THAT WHEN I MOVED HERE AND- WAS CENTER INSTRUMENTAL AND- HIRING AND HUMAN RESOURCE DIRECTOR FOR SPOTLIGHT TWENTY NINE CASINO AND THE TWENTY NINE PALMS BAND OF MISSION INDIANS. WE ALSO HAD A GED PROGRAM THAT RAN FOR TWO YEARS AT SPOTLIGHT AND WE GRADUATED OVER SEVENTY FIVE OF OUR EMPLOYEES WITH THEIR G. D. SO. I YEAR- I WOULD LIKE TO- START BY SAYING THAT THROUGH MY YEARS OF WORKING AS A HUMAN RESOURCE DIRECTOR AND AS AN EDUCATOR I'VE SEEN THE TRANSFORMATION OF SEVERAL PEOPLE'S LIVES AND- HOW ARE MANY HAVE COME FROM ALCOHOLISM AND DRUGS AND- A SENSE OF HELPLESSNESS- TO- EMPLOYMENT. AND VIRTUAL TURN AROUND THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES SO I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A TRUE BELIEVER IN EDUCATION. AND- AND- THE HELP OF NATIVE AMERICANS. BUT TRANSFORMING THE LIVES OF NATIVE AMERICANS AS- MOST OF THE TIME NOT AN EASY TASK. IN ORDER TO AFFECT CHANGE PEOPLE NEED VOICES AND CHANCES SOMETIMES THEY GET NEITHER. I REMEMBER WHENI WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL- AND IN MY FINAL YEAR TWELFTH GRADE. THE COUNSELORS WOULD COME AND PICK DIFFERENT CHILDREN FROM THE CLASSROOM AND THEY WOULD BE GONE FOR OUR SEEMINGLY. AND THEN WHEN IT WAS MY TURN I WAS GONE FOR FIVE MINUTES SO WHAT I WAS TOLD. I WOULD PROBABLY NEVER ATTEND COLLEGE SO AND I WAS SENT BACK TO CLASS. SO I NEVER REALLY HAD A CHOICE BACKGROUND AND NEVER KNEW WHAT MY CHOICES WERE. BUT AS WE STARTED WORKING ON THE COLLEGE AT LEMME AND HERE IN CALIFORNIA. WE TRIED TO GIVE PEOPLE THOSE CHANCES AND THOSE CHOICES. YOU'RE SORT OF CHRISTIAN AND SUPPRESSION HAS LEFT MANY. WITHOUT EITHER FOR CENTURIES THEY HAVE TAKEN THE LAND THEY HAVE SUPPRESSED THE LANGUAGE AND THE RELOCATION AS SIMULATION ACT OF NINETEEN FIFTY THREE WHERE THEY CHECK NATIVE AMERICANS FROM THE RESERVATIONS AND PLACED THEM. IN TRAINING SESSIONS OR ON THE JOB TRAINING COUNTRY THEY ESPECIALLY AT LAMBING A LOT OF LET ME SCAN HERE TO CALIFORNIA. AND WE'RE GIVEN AND- MINIMAL JOBS- WERE TAUGHT WELDING IN MOST CASES MY MOTHER WAS A WELDER- BUT THOSE JOBS DIDN'T LAST AND SO ASSEMBLY SHOULDN'T DIDN'T WORK AND THE RELOCATION PROGRAM. DIDN'T WORK FOR A GREAT MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE- EVENTUALLY EVERYONE MOVED BACK TO THE RESERVATIONS. SO ALL OF THIS MAY HAVE LEARNED A TRADE BUT COULDN'T USE THAT IF THEY GOT A JOB THAT WAS AT MINIMUM WAGE AND- WE'RE NOT ABLE TO FULLY ASSIMILATE INTO SOCIETY. AND PAY THE RENT AND HAVE FOOD TO EAT AND HAVE NO MEDICAL CARE. THESE ARE JUST A FEW OF THE ACTIONS BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND STATES ALSO GET INVOLVED THERE IS NO ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ON RESERVATIONS. UNTIL THE CABAZON DECISION. THAT STARTED GAMING EVEN IN GAMING AS I WAS THE HUMAN RESOURCE DIRECTOR I SAW THE- THE TURN AROUND THERE'S SOME OF OUR- TRIBAL MEMBERS WHO REALLY WANT TO WORK BUT- COULD NEVER GET HIRED IN ANY TOWN OR CITY. BECAUSE OF RACISM. SO. AND THEN IN ORDER TO APPLY FOR STATE ASSISTANCE. TRIBAL MEMBERS WERE NOT ALLOWED TO OWN ANYTHING WHICH IS AT LET ME HOW WE LOST A LOT OF OUR TRIBAL LANDS IF YOU WANTED- STATUS SYSTEM. OF FOOD AND MEDICAL YOU HAVE TO SELL EVERYTHING YOU HAVE A VALUE INCLUDING CARS AND LANDS. IN ORDER TO GET FOOD STAMPS BACK DOWN OR COMMODITY FOODS THAT WAS ISSUED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. IN OUR GRADES ARE K. THROUGH TWELVE- EDUCATION WAS ONLY GOOD FOR TRIBAL MEMBERS THROUGH WHAT I CALL COUNT WEEK I DON'T KNOW IF ANY OF YOU. REALIZE WHAT COUNT WEEK AS- STILL DISTRICTS WERE GIVEN FUNDING BY THE STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BASED ON THE NUMBER OF AMERICANS ATTENDING IN THAT SCHOOL DISTRICT. SO THEY GUARDIAN AS MANY NATIVE AMERICANS AS A CREDIT BEARING CAL POLY AND THEN DIDN'T CARE A SHOW ABOUT FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR. SO MANY NATIVE AMERICANS- WHERE EITHER DISMISSED- WE'RE- PICKED ON TO THE POINT OF GETTING IN FIGHTS AND THEN LATER DISMISSED FROM SCHOOL SO THEY COULD NEVER GRADUATE. SO THAT WAS CANNOT BE. IF YOU LOOK NOW AT THE THIRTY EIGHT TRIBAL COLLEGES IN THE UNITED STATES PARTICULARLY HERE IN CALIFORNIA- EDUCATION IS THRIVING FOR SOME OF THOSE. AND SO. WE ARE ALSO- TRYING TO PICK UP- AND HELP- PUT TOGETHER A GOOD EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM FOR. ARROGANCE BY STARTING CALIFORNIA INDIAN NATIONS COLLEGE. AS I MENTIONED BEFORE WE ARE AS MENTIONED BY BRAHMOS WE STARTED OUT AS LONG BEACH COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND WE CAN GET ANY TRIBES THAT JOINED US AT THAT TIME. WHEN WE TRANSITIONED OUR NAME TO NORTHWEST INDIAN COLLEGE WE HAVE NOW SERVED OVER ONE HUNDRED TRIBES NATIONWIDE WHO COME TO LET ME. TO FINISH THEIR EDUCATION- AND- WHEN WE FIRST STARTED THE END OF TWO THOUSAND AND- R. SEVENTEEN- WE TOOK TOOK A LOOK AT THE STATISTICS. NOT OUR STATISTICS BUT THE STATISTICS ARE YOU SEE ARE AND COLLEGE OF THE DESERT WHICH ARM SHOWED THAT THERE WERE OVER. EIGHT HUNDRED. ALMOST A NATIVE AMERICANS LIVING IN CALIFORNIA BUT LESS THAN 1% ATTENDED. BY- THEIR OWN RECOGNITION OF BEING NATIVE AMERICAN. ARE A COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY LESS THAN 1% SO THAT PROVES THE NEED- AND THEN WE ALSO TALKED ABOUT HOW. YOU HAVE TO KIND OF SELF IDENTIFIED WHEN YOU'RE ENROLLED FOR A COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY BECAUSE SOMETIMES NATIVE AMERICAN IS NOT LET THAT. SO THERE IS REALLY NO WAY TO KNOW IF THE STATISTICS ARE CORRECT OR NOT. BECAUSE MOST NATIVE AMERICANS DON'T CHOOSE OTHER. THEY'D RATHER CHOOSE NOTHING. SO- IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE DOOR TWENTY TWENTY SENSES- IT STATES THAT THERE ARE NOW MORE THAN ONE POINT TWO MILLION. THEY GIVE AMERICANS LIVING IN CALIFORNIA SO. IS A TRIBAL COLLEGE NECESSARY I WOULD SAY YES AND BY THE NUMBERS THAT WE'RE SHOWING CALIFORNIA AND YOU NATION'S COLLEGE. BILL WOULD SAY YES WE ARE OUR NUMBERS ARE GROWING- SEMESTER OVER SEMESTER AND. I THINK WE HAVE A GOOD RUNNING START. R. I WOULD LIKE TO-STOP THERE YEAH- INJECTED CELESTE COUNSEL ARE THE PRESIDENT. YOU CAN C. E. O. CALIFORNIA INDIAN NATIONS COLLEGE AND THANK YOU FOR MY TIME. THANK YOU THE HONORABLE- MISS MIKE AND WOMEN OF DISTINCTION- FROM ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND WHY THOSE DISTRICT- IN TWENTY. TWENTY AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE.

RIVERSIDE CALIFORNIA I AM A MEMBER CITIZEN ENROLLED MEMBER OF THE FORT IT WILL INDIAN COMMUNITY. I WANT TO THANK RAMOS AND I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL I PARTICULARLY WOULD LOVE TO THANK THESE WONDERFUL PEOPLE WHO HAVE GIVEN TESTIMONY. AND THANK THOSE. WHOSE LAND WE REMAIN ON AND I THINK OUR CREATOR. SO AND THANK YOU TERESA WHAT I REALLY WANT YOU TO DO IS TAKE A LOOK AT OUR- SEAL. THIS SEAL DEPICTS SO MUCH WORK IN MEANING FOR THE COLLEGE IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE CRACKS ON THE SIDE THOSE ARE FOR THE CONTINUED BROKEN PROMISES THAT WE- AS INDIAN PEOPLE EXPERIENCE. YOU LOOK AT THE MANY STARS IN THE IN THE BETTER. THAT REPRESENTS ALL THE TRIBES IN CALIFORNIA RECOGNIZED AND UNRECOGNIZED. YOU LOOK AT THE SUN YOU CAN'T TELL IF IT'S A SUNSET OR THIS OR THE SUN GOING DOWN BECAUSE EACH DAY BEGINS WITH THE SUN COMING UP IN THE SUN GOING DOWN. YOU LOOK AT THAT BEAR THAT'S THE BARE OF CALIFORNIA EVEN THOUGH IT'S A ZUNI BEAR IT'S STILL OF BEAR IN A TRADITIONAL FORMAT. YOU LOOK AT THE FIRE IN THE BELLY. AND THAT'S TO REPLICATE WHAT MAINSTREAM EDUCATION HAS IS THE LAMP OF LEARNING. THIS IS OUR WAY OF LEARNING AROUND THE FIRE WITH OUR FAMILY WITH THEIR ELDERS. SO GIVEN THE FOUNDATION AND HISTORY OF INDIAN EDUCATION IS PRESENTED EARLIER. THERE REMAINS TO BE A DISTRESSED IN MAINSTREAM EDUCATION WHERE INTER-WOVEN TRAUMA. IS INGRAINED IN THE MINDS OF NATIVE AMERICAN FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT THE MIND SET OF FREE EDUCATION. TO THE GENERATIONS OF OUR PEOPLE WAS TO REMOVE THEIR IDENTITY WAS TO REMOVE AND ERASE THEIR LANGUAGE TO REMOVE THEIR SUPPORT SYSTEM. WITHIN THEIR CULTURE AND FAMILIES WHICH IN ESSENCE MEANT TO REMOVE THEIR WAY OF LIFE. AND IN MANY CASES REMOVE THEIR LIVES CLEARLY DEPICTED IN A PHOTO THAT STATES HERE THAT BOARDING SCHOOLS ARE THE ONLY SCHOOLS ON THE PLANET OUR STUDENTS ARE REMEMBERED AS SURVIVORS NOT GRADUATES IT REALLY HITS HOME WHEN YOU THINK OF THAT. THERE'S SO MUCH HIDDEN ATROCITIES BUT W CAN SEE HOW THOSE SURVIVORS OR GRADUATES HAVE CHANGED TO TODAY MORE COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES WHO HAVE TAKEN A STEP TO APOLOGIZE TO INDIAN COUNTRY THROUGH DIVERSE CITY INITIATIVES SOCIAL INJUSTICE PROGRAMS AND LANDEC KNOWLEDGE MINTS OR MAINSTREAM EDUCATION HAS GOOD INTENTIONS BY INCORPORATING ACKNOWLEDGEMENT CEREMONIES AND PROGRAMS. THEIR INTENTIONS OFTEN PROMOTE SYMBOLS OVER SUBSTANCE WE NEED FOR RESTORATIVE JUSTICE AMERICANS COMPRISE LESS THAN 1% OF THE UNITED STATES POST SECONDARY POPULATION AND EVEN ACCORDING TO WORLD POPULATION REVIEW NEXT SLIDE PLEASE CALIFORNIA HAS THE HIGHEST NUMBER NATIVE AMERICANS WITH THE POPULATION OF OVER SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY SEVEN SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND. BETTER IT TO HAVE BEEN TAKEN IN THE CENSUS AND WE KNOW THAT SKEWED BECAUSE NOT MANY ARE ABLE TO CLAIM IT BECAUSE OF THEIR- OWN REGISTERED OR FOR A LACK OF. CONFIDENCE OKAY OKLAHOMA FOLLOWS CALIFORNIA WITH A LITTLE OVER. FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY THREE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED NATIVE AMERICANS YEAH OKLAHOMA HAS THREE ACCREDITED TRIBAL COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES AND CALIFORNIA HAS ZERO. SINK OR CALIFORNIA AND THE NATION'S COLLEGE AS CALIFORNIA'S FIRST FULLY ACCREDITED TRIBAL COLLEGE WILL STRENGTHEN TH STATE'S ABILITY TO IMPROVE POSTSECONDARY EDUCATIONAL ACCESS AND CLOSE THAT GAP. SYNC WILL ALSO ALLOW EACH STUDENT TO SECURE THEIR AND TRUSTED ACADEMIC PATHWAY TO A FOUR YEAR UNIVERSITY OF THEIR CHOICE. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. AND YOU HEARD FROM MRS MIKE. ASSEMBLY MEN GRABBED A GARCIA YOU'LL NOTICE THIS PICTURE HAS HER CAN YOU AWARDED HER THIS AND THIS IS MIKE AS SHE AS SHE WAS INTRODUCED IS THE FOUNDER OF CALIFORNIA AND IN NATION'S COLLEGE AND SHE'S ALL TOO FAMILIAR WITH THE HISTORY IN THE CONTINUE CHALLENGES OF LIMITED OR SHOULD I SAY RESTRICTED ACCESS TO QUALITY EDUCATION. IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN SHE BEGAN A MEETING OF THE MINDS THAT INCLUDED A COALITION OF OVER THIRTY FIVE PROFESSIONALS AND EDUCATORS IN INLAND EMPIRE.

OUR COLLEGE OPERATES WITH THE NORMALCY OF UNDERSTANDING THE LACK OF DISK ACCESSIBILITY AND INCLUSION WE UNDERSTAND THE HISTORICAL AND MULTI GENERATIONAL TRAUMA AND DISTRUST. IN EDUCATIONAL AND HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS WE UNDERSTAND THE SOCIAL DYNAMICS OF TWO WORLDS ESPECIALLY IN CEREMONIAL SECRETION TRADITIONS AND CELEBRATIONS AND WE UNDERSTAND AND WORK TO AMEND THE SYSTEMATIC STANDARDS THAT OPERATE THROUGH SOCIAL PERCEPTIONS AND BIASED IDEOLOGIES. CALIFORNIA INTONATIONS COLLEGE AIMS TO REGAIN THE TRUST IN EDUCATION FOR OUR NATIVE AMERICAN AND INDIGENOUS PEOPLE. BY ONE WE IDENTIFY RESEARCH AND DEVELOP A SUPPORT SYSTEM THAT CONFRONTS THE CHALLENGES FOR OUR PEOPLE AND OUR STUDENTS WHO DID NOT THINK OF YVERDON. CONSIDER OR EVEN CONSIDER GOING TO COLLEGE. THERE MUST BE A FULL COMMITMENT TO FULLY EXAMINE THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITIES AND THE PAST FAILURES TO WHERE PEOPLE.

WE TREAT EVERY STUDENT AS A PERSON THEY'RE NOT LOST IN MAINSTREAM SYSTEMS THEY'RE NOT JUST A STUDENT ID NUMBER WE PROVIDE PERSONALIZED IN IN JULY INDIVIDUALIZED SERVICE TO ALL. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE I WILL REPEAT THE QUOTE THE DOCTOR WAR SOLDIER PRESENTED EARLIER THE AMERICAN INDIAN COLLEGE FUND REMINDS US THAT IN VISIBILITY IN ESSENCE THE MODERN FORM OF RACISM AGAINST NATIVE AMERICANS. THIS INDIVISIBLE INVISIBILITY LEADS A COLLEGE TO COLLEGE ACCESS AND COMPLETION CRISIS AMONG NATIVE AMERICAN STUDENTS. EVIDENCE CONFIRMS THAT CULTURALLY BASED RESOURCES AND OPPORTUNITIES IN AND OUTSIDE OF THE CLASSROOM PROVIDE STUDENTS WITH THE CRITICAL SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE THEY NEED TO LEAD COMMUNITIES. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. WE PROVIDE INDIVIDUALIZED AND PERSONALIZED SERVICE TO OUR STUDENTS FACULTY STAFF AND COMMUNITY WE HEAR THE VOICES OF ALL AND WORK TO INCORPORATE AND STRENGTHEN OUR COURSE OFFERINGS ARE WORKSHOPS ARE PROGRAMS AND ADVANCE WE FOSTER INDIGENIZATION KNOWLEDGE VALUES CULTURE TRADITIONS AND PERSPECTIVES TO SHARE AND DEVELOP A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING AND RESPECT FOR PEOPLE AND THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. WE AIM TO INCREASE EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES ACCESS AND OPPORTUNITIES THROUGH SCHOLARSHIPS AND LISTENING TO THE VOICES OF OUR STUDENTS. WE NOT ONLY AIM TO RECOGNIZE ACHIEVEMENTS AND RESILIENCY BUT WE ALSO PROVIDE THE SUPPORT AND RESOURCES AND CAREER OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL WE HAVE STUDENT TESTIMONIES THAT HAVE SAID THEY- SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN JAIL AND NOT PLANNING FOR COLLEGE OR THAT THEY DIDN'T SEE THEM EVEN ATTENDING COLLEGE WE HAVE STUDENTS THAT WEREN'T ACCEPTED IN ANY OF THE RACES COMING FROM MULTI GENERATION GENERAL. MULTI RACES OF HER ETHNIC BACKGROUNDS. I ALWAYS MENTION THAT IT TOOK ME MORE THAN TWELVE YEARS TO ATTAIN MY ASSOCIATE'S DEGREE I ATTENDED A GREAT HIGH SCHOOL IN THE INLAND EMPIRE. I HAD FANTASTIC GREAT GREAT ATTENDANCE BUT NEVER WAS I CALLED IN BY THE COUNSELOR AND ACKNOWLEDGED. OF OR EVEN CONSIDERED OR TO TAKE THE SAT USER SEAT'S I HEARD OF MY PEERS GOING AND TAKING THESE EXAMS THEM BEING CALLED IN. BUT I WAS NEVER CALLED IN. SO I WASN'T FAMILIAR WITH THE SYSTEMS AND WHAT IT TOOK TO GO TO COLLEGE- I ENDED UP WORKING IMMEDIATELY AFTER HIGH SCHOOL AND DECIDED I WANTED TO TAKE A CLASS AT A TIME AND IT WASN'T UNTIL I STARTED WORKING AT SHERMAN ENDED HIGH SCHOOL. THAT ONE OF THE COUNSELORS THERE HELPED ME AS A CO WORKER AND ENCOURAGE ME TO GO TO SCHOOL AND FROM THERE I WENT AND GOT I FINISHED MY ASSOCIATES DEGREE I GOT MY BACHELOR'S DEGREE AND I GOT MY MASTER'S DEGREE THAT WAS THE COUNSELOR SHERMAN A CO WORKER. WHO HELPED ME. THANK WILL NOT OPERATE IN A STRUCTURE OF TOP HEAVY HIERARCHIES WE AIM TO SECURE STAFF TO STUDENT RATIOS THAT WILL SUPPORT OUR MISSION. OF PERCIVAL PERSONALIZING INDIVIDUALIZED SERVICES. SAID THAT THE NEEDS OF EVERY SINGLE STUDENT IS HEARD. AND THAT A PERSONALIZED PATHWAY IS PUT IN PLACE. FOUR WE LOOK TO REDUCE DROPOUT RATES AND INCREASE THE LOW ENROLLMENT OF NATIVE PEOPLE IN POST SECONDARY EDUCATION. THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR EDUCATION STATISTICS RATE REPORT THAT NATIVE STUDENTS MAKE UP POINT 8% OF THE TOTAL COLLEGE POPULATION NATIVE AMERICAN CITIZENS WHO ATTEND A TRIBAL COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY ARE FOUR TIMES MORE LIKELY TO RECEIVE A BACHELOR'S DEGREE THAN THOSE WHO ENROLL IN MAINSTREAM FOUR YEAR UNIVERSITIES. AND EVEN STILL ON THIS SLIDE YOU'LL SEE THAT ACCORDING TO POST SECONDARY NATIONAL POLICY INSTITUTE A REPORT THAT WAS GENERATED IN NOVEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. YOUR FOUR YEAR OLDS. OF NATIVE AMERICANS ARE ENROLLED IN COLLEGE COMPARED TO THE 41% OF THE OVERALL UNITED STATES POPULATION. 41% OF FIRST TIME FULL TIME NATIVE STUDENTS ATTENDING FOUR YEAR UNIVERSITIES BEGINNING IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN GRADUATED WITHIN SIX YEARS COMPARED TO THE SIXTY THREE PERCENT. FOR ALL STUDENTS IN THE UNITED STATES. IN ATTENDED PUBLIC TWO YEAR OR FOUR YEAR INSTITUTIONS ALSO IN OVER THE AGE OF TWENTY FIVE HAD AN ASSOCIATE'S DEGREE. COMPARED OF TWENTY FIVE IN THE UNITED STATES BETWEEN THE YEARS TWO THOUSAND AND TEN AND TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THE PERCENTAGE OF NATIVE AMERICANS OVER THE AGE OF TWENTY FIVE WHO HAD ATTAINED AN ASSOCIATE'S DEGREE. INCREASE FROM 21% 225% SEEING AIMS. TO HELP THIS NUMBER GROW STILL LESS THAN 16% OF OUR NATIVE AMERICANS HOLD A BACHELOR'S DEGREE OR HIGHER COMPARED TO THE NEARLY POPULATION. SO FIVE WE AIM TO DECREASE IF NOT ELIMINATE SYSTEMATIC BIASES AND BREAK DOWN THOSE SOCIAL BARRIERS IN THE CLASSROOM YOUR HIRING PRACTICES QUALIFIED ELDER TO THE SYSTEMATIC BARRIERS AND IDEOLOGUE ALL THE CHEESE HE TAUGHT A CLASS WHERE I WITNESSED STUDENTS HAS PERSONABLE AND TRADITIONAL TRAITS DID NOT MEET THE EXPECTATIONS AND A SYSTEMATIC JUDGMENT OF CHARACTER PROCESS IS OF GOOD INTENTIONS THE INEFFECTIVENESS TOWARDS OUR CULTURE ALLOWS FOR THIS DISPLAY OF SELF IMPORTANCE. TO PERPETUATE MISUNDERSTANDINGS THAT PROLIFERATE THE EXCLUSION OF NATIVE AMERICAN VOICES AND THE ELEGANCE OF THEIR TRADITIONAL VOICE. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO WE CELEBRATE DIVERSITY INCLUSION THEIR NORMALCY FOUND IT CALIFORNIA IN THE NATION'S COLLEGE IS ONE OF A SAFE AND TRUSTED LEARNING ENVIRONMENT WITHOUT OUR TRIBAL COLLEGE AND THOSE LOOKING TO EMERGE WEEK WOULD CONTINUE TO. ALL SUBJECT TO THE PERPETUAL MARGINALIZATION AS A PEOPLE IN A SYSTEM THAT WAS ESTABLISHED AND REMAINS UNDER SOCIETY'S PRINCIPLES AND SOCIAL STANDARDS MANDATE OF BLOOD QUANTUM WE AS INDIVIDUALS MUST PROVIDE PROOF THROUGH A CERTIFICATE OF INDIAN BLOOD THAT WE ARE REGISTERED WITH THE FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBES AND AT A MINIMUM OF ONE QUARTER OR ONE FOURTH DEGREE AND IN BLOOD TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL ASSISTANCE. AND YET THIS SYSTEMIC CONTROL DRIBBLES DOWN TO OUR TRIBAL COLLEGE WHERE WE MUST PROVIDE PROOF THAT OUR STUDENT POPULATION IS THAT OF OVER FIFTY ONE PERCENT. NOT A PROBLEM. BUT A SHAME THAT SOME ARE IDENTIFIED AS NOT INDIAN ENOUGH. AND THEN AS THERESA MENTIONED WERE SUBJECT TO A FORM OF ACCOUNT WEEK. HOW MANY INDIANS DO HAVE. CALIFORNIA IN THE NATION'S COLLEGE OFFERS HIGH QUALITY FULLY ACCREDITED COURSES THROUGH OUR PARTNER COLLEGE OF THE DESERT TO ALL STUDENTS FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED STATE RECOGNIZE SELF IDENTIFIED AND THOSE THAT ARE NOT. WE DO NOT FURTHER COLONIZE THE QUALIFICATION OF RANKING OF OUR DIVERSE NATIVE AND INDIGENOUS PEOPLE. WE INCORPORATE AND RESPECT THE NATIVE AMERICAN AND INDIGENOUS WISDOM TRADITIONS WELL BEING AND KNOWLEDGE IS PASSED DOWN THROUGH ELDERS AND LEADERS. SOME OF WHO HAVE THE MOST VALUABLE AND EFFECTIVE TRUTHS STORIES SONGS AND DANCE THESE ARE TRAITS BLESSINGS AND EXPERIENCE THAT ARE FAR RESERVED AND PROTECTED FROM BEING SHARED OR RECORDED IN A BOOK. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE SO WHERE ARE WE. WE CURRENTLY OFFER ASSOCIATES DEGREES LIBERAL EN EL LIBERAL ARTS DIRECTORS PARDON ME IN LIBERAL ARTS STUDIES TO PREPARE STUDENTS TO TRANSFER TO A WIDE RANGE OF BACCALAUREATE PROGRAMS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF THEIR CHOICE WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING WITH A FEW LOCAL FOUR YEAR UNIVERSITIES TO LAUNCH GUIDED PATHWAYS. AND YET TO DATE SANK HAS GRADUATED TWELVE STUDENTS AND HAVE SERVED OVER A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY STUDENTS WHO REPRESENT OVER FIFTY FIVE TRIBAL NATIONS. NEXT OH I'M SORRY WE CONSIDER. OUR MEDIAN AGE IS THIRTY TWO AND THIS PAST FALL SEMESTER OUR STUDENT POPULATION REMAINED UNCHANGED WHILE LOCAL COLLEGES HAVE EXPERIENCED AT 31% DECREASE THANK HELD STRONG WITH THE 10% INCREASE. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO GREATER INCREASE THE FALL TWENTY TWENTY TWO. WE CURRENTLY HAVE A TRANSFER RATE OF 67% WITH THE FEW REMAINING AT OUR COLLEGE TO SECURE THE MOST TRANSFERABLE CREDITS THAT THEY CAN EARN BEFORE MAKING THAT TRANSITION. THE DECISION HAS ALSO BEEN BASED TO REMAIN IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT AND STAY WITH THEIR FRIENDS AND TRANSFER TOGETHER. AGAIN THE SOCIAL. SUPPORT OF THEIR COMMUNITY. SO WHERE ARE WE GOING NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. THIS TIME NEXT YEAR SAME GAMES TO SUBMIT THE APPLICATION FOR ACCREDITATION THROUGH THE ACCREDITING COMMISSION FOR COMMISSION FOR COMMUNITY AND JUNIOR COLLEGES IS IT IT IS BEING SHARED BY THE FORMER PRESIDENT OF A.

WHY AND MY FATHER DIDN'T WANT TO SHARE AND SHIELDED ME PROTECTED ME FROM THE HISTORY OF THAT HE ENTERED BEING A YOU CAN MAN. OF BEING IN THE IN INDIAN SCHOOLS BOARDING SCHOOLS FORCED TO GO TO THE- MILITARY WHICH HE SERVED PROUDLY- SO I'M HERE TO PROVIDE PUBLIC COMMENT TO SHARE THAT YOU KNOW THIS IS WHY. YOU KNOW IT'S I'M FORTY TWO YEARS OLD. PUT IT OUT THERE AND I HAVE JUST LEARNT SIMPLY TO SAY HELLO. THIS SO I'M HERE TO SUPPORT THE NAME CHANGE AND I APPRECIATE ALL THAT ARE HERE. TO HELP SUPPORT THAT AS WELL AND YOU KNOW REALLY PUT OUT THERE THAT THE IMPORTANCE OF REVITALIZING ARE YOU KILLING WHICH AND- ALLOWING US TO NAME UC HASTINGS COLLEGE IN AND YOU CAN NAME. OVER THE YEARS I HAVE WORKED WITH- YOU KNOW AGAIN NOT HAVING ANY CONNECTION AT ALL WITH MY YOU CUTE PEOPLE AND LANGUAGE PEOPLE WHO CAN SPEAK AND TEACH. I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO WORK WITH- PALMO COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND ONE OF THE- ONE OF MY DEAR FRIENDS WHO IS A HIGH SCHOOL YOU KNOW THAT I MET IN MIDDLE SCHOOL SHE IS A MEMBER OF THE ROUNDUP OF THE REDWOOD VALLEY RANCHERIA. BAND OF POMO INDIANS SHE HAS ONE OF THE ONLY CREDIT ATIONS TO TEACH COMMON LANGUAGE IN OUR COMMUNITY. SHE TOUCHED MY HEART- WHEN SHE SHARED THAT THE REASON WHY SHE NAMED HER CHILDREN POMO NAMES WAS SO THAT EVERY DAY WHEN HER KIDS ARE SENT TO INSTITUTIONS BECAUSE I'M NOT GOING TO REITERATE THE HISTORY INSTITUTIONALIZATION. AND THE WAY THAT WE WERE IN OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM WHICH IS YOU KNOW MOVING IN A POSITIVE DIRECTION. WAS NOT GOOD FOR US AS NATIVE PEOPLE IT WASN'T MEANT FOR US TO BE WHERE WE ARE TODAY HER PERSONAL WAY TO ENCOURAGE TO DO TO CHANGE HER RESTORED THIS DEFICIT JUSTICE EFFORTS IN HER OWN WAY TO. ENCOURAGE EVERY INSTITUTION EVERY PLACE SHE WENT WHEN THEY SAID HER CHILDREN'S NAMES THEY WERE SPEAKING POMO LANGUAGE BECAUSE OUR LANGUAGE. HAS PUT IN PALMA WAS ALSO SOMETHING THAT WAS TAKEN FROM. SO WITHOUT THOUGHT THAT'S WHERE I SUPPORT YOU KNOW HI. A. LIKE THROUGH THE WEEK YOU KNOW I AGREE WITH THE OTHER ASSEMBLY PERSON THAT YOU KNOW IT I LOVE THAT HE POINTED OUT YOU KNOW THESE. THE IN FAGAN POINTED OUT ALL OF THESE OTHER- MEMBERS OF THE SENATE INTERNEES AND- WITH KAMILLA HARRIS. AND HOW WE NEED TO UPHOLD THEIR- YOU KNOW THEY'RE RIGHT TO BE GRADUATES OF THIS COLLEGE BUT FOR ME I LOVE THE WAY THAT HE SPOKE UP ON THEIR BEHALF BECAUSE THERE ARE THEY ARE FROM THERE ARE GRADUATES WHO ARE FROM OTHER ETHNICITIES.

THAT THE NURSE THE NAME IN ITSELF MISSION MEANS MEANT WAS BRITAIN TO EXTERMINATE NATIVE AMERICANS HE ASKED IN OUR COMMUNITY THAT WE REFRAIN FROM WRITING OUR POLICY IS A MISSION STATEMENT BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE TERM MEANT. AND THAT WE CHANGE IT TO A VISION STATEMENT BECAUSE- SAN FRANCISCO WAS BASED ON A MISSION. THE NAME SAN FRANCISCO COMES FROM A MISSIONARY WHO WE HAVE LEARNT TODAY THAT MISSIONARY YOU KNOW THE MISSION SYSTEM WAS TO TAKE AWAY OUR CULTURE AND POSE ANOTHER- SO. AGAIN THE IMPORTANCE IF WE'RE GOING TO BE PROVIDING RESTORATIVE JUSTICE TO OUR PEOPLE. LOOKING AT ONLY CHANGING THE NAME OF HASTINGS IS LIKE CUTTING OFF YOU KNOW WE'VE TALKED YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT. POINTING OUT THE HISTORY IF WE DO ONLY CHANGE THE NAME FACING WERE ACTING AS IF EVERYTHING WAS PERFECT SINCE THEN. AND THAT NOTHING STOPPED BUT FROM THAT CASE FROM NOT THOSE ORDERS OF HASTING THEN CAME THE MISSIONS THEN CAME THE RAPING STAN CAME THIS YEAR. ALL OF THESE ATROCITIES GENOCIDE THAT CAME UPON US AND TODAY WE ARE WELL AWARE THAT. LOOK AT ALL OF THE CHILDREN THAT HAVE BEEN FOUND NATIONALLY. IN THE BOARDING SCHOOL SYSTEMS THOSE ARE THE SAME MISSION STYLE EDUCATION SYSTEMS THAT OF. CONCORD AND COMMUNITIES GENOCIDES TOWARDS PEOPLE SO THAT WITH THAT I JUST GRACIOUSLY ASK YOU TO CONSIDER. ALLOWING US TO REVITALIZE THEIR LANGUAGE WITH THE POPE ARE YOU KIDDING ME. EVERY FROM REPEATING HERE WHEN WE DON'T PUT IT OUT THERE YOU'RE RIGHT WE REPEAT.
