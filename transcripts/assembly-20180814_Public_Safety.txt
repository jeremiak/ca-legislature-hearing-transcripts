FOR OTHER MEMBERS UP TO COME -- MR QUIRK AND I WILL HOLD DOWN THE FORT UNTIL THE OTHER MEMBERS GET HERE HOPEFULLY SOON -- IN THE MEANTIME WE'LL WE'LL BEGAN BECAUSE ONE BE SENSITIVE. TO ON BE AUTHORS -- TIME -- WE HAVE -- TWO ITEMS ON THE AGENDA TODAY -- SO WAS BEGIN WITH MISS ALONG. ON AJ OUR THIRTY THREE A TREATY ON PROHIBITION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS YOU MAY BEGIN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AJ OUR THIRTY THREE URGES FEDERAL LEADERS AND OUR NATION TO EMBRACE THE UNITED NATIONS TREATY ON THE PROHIBITION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS. MAKE IT NUCLEAR DISARMAMENT THE CENTERPIECE OF OUR NATIONAL SECURITY POLICY AND SPEARHEAD A GLOBAL EFFORT TO PREVENT NUCLEAR WAR. THE RESOLUTION ALSO CALLS UPON OUR FEDERAL LEADERS TO AND THE PRESIDENT'S SOUL UNCHECKED AUTHORITY TO LAUNCH A NUCLEAR WEAPON. AND TO OPPOSE THE PROPOSED SPENDING OF TRILLIONS OVER THE COMING DECADES TO REBUILD OUR NUCLEAR ARSENAL. SINCE THE HEIGHT OF THE COLD WAR THE UNITED STATESAND RUSSIA HAVE DISMANTLED MORE THAN FIFTY THOUSAND NUCLEAR WARHEADS BUT FIFTEEN THOUSAND OF THESE WEAPONS STILL EXISTS AND POSE AN AND TOLERABLE RISKS TO HUMAN SURVIVAL. CITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA INCLUDING OHIO THE CITY IN THE DISTRICT I REPRESENT HAVE PASSED SIMILAR RESOLUTIONS CALIFORNIA HAS LONG HELD THE NATION ON IMPORTANT ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL POLICIES AND WE MUST DO SO AGAIN. THIS TIME ON THE CRITICAL ISSUE OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS I HAVE WITH ME TODAY AT MORELIA KELLY WITH THE TRI VALLEY'S CARE AND TO RECLAIM IN OF THE NUCLEAR AGE PEACE FOUNDATION TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. ARE THE RAZA. THANK YOU TWO MINUTES APIECE OR FIVE MINUTES ALTOGETHER OR FORM ONE HOW MANY. OF WHERE WE WANT TO WORK IT OUT. WE'LL TRY TO BE SUCCINCT. BROWN SHIRTS. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY THANKING MY ASSEMBLY MEMBER MONIQUE LIMON FOR INTRODUCING THIS IMPORTANT RESOLUTION. I'M RICK WOMEN ON DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE NUCLEAR AGE PEACE FOUNDATION A NONPROFIT HEADQUARTERED IN SANTA BARBARA. I WE'VE GOT OVER TEN THOUSAND MEMBERS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK. LAST YEAR I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF PARTICIPATING IN NEGOTIATIONS AT THE UNITED NATIONS FOR THE TREATY ON THE PROHIBITION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS. AS A PARTNER ORGANIZATION OF THE INTERNATIONAL CAMPAIGN TO ABOLISH NUCLEAR WEAPONS AS IS MY COLLEAGUE MARY LEAH. AND TRY VALLEY CARES A WE SHARE IN THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN NOBEL PEACE PRIZE THAT WAS AWARDED FOR OUR WORK ON THIS GROUNDBREAKING TREATY. RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT IS CHOOSING TO SPEND OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS PER MINUTE FOR THE NEXT THIRTY YEARS ON NUCLEAR WEAPONS UPGRADES. BUT IT'S NOT JUST DOLLARS THAT WE'RE SQUANDERING. NUCLEAR WEAPONS ARE INDISCRIMINATE MASS KILLING DEVICES. ANY USE WOULD BE ILLEGITIMATE AND WHOLLY UNACCEPTABLE. CALIFORNIA HAS A LONG AND PROUD HISTORY OF SETTING POSITIVE LEGISLATIVE TRENDS AND KICK STARTING THE PROCESS OF CHANGE NATIONWIDE. THAT'S WHY AJ OUR THIRTY THREE IS SO IMPORTANT TODAY. THE RESOLUTION LAYS OUT SOME OF THE CATASTROPHIC HUMANITARIAN CONSEQUENCES THAT COULD OCCUR SHOULD NUCLEAR WEAPONS BE USED AGAIN. I'VE WORKED CLOSELY WITH PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD WHO HAVE BEEN DEEPLY IMPACTED BY NUCLEAR WEAPONS DEVELOPMENT TESTING IN USE AND EVERYONE OF THEM TELLS ME THE SAME THING. WE MUST PUT AN END TO NUCLEAR WEAPONS SO THAT NO ONE EVER SUFFERS THE SAME FATE. THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA NOW HAVE A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTRIBUTE TO THIS NOBLE GOAL. FOR FIFTY YEARS THE U. S. HAS BEEN PART OF THE NUCLEAR NONPROLIFERATION TREATY WHICH HAS BEEN REMARKABLY SUCCESSFUL AT PREVENTING THE SPREAD OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS TO ADDITIONAL COUNTRIES. BUT IT HAS FAILED TO COMPEL THE NUCLEAR ARMS STATES TO FULFILL THEIR OBLIGATION TO NEGOTIATE IN GOOD FAITH FOR AN END TO THE NUCLEAR ARMS RACE AND FOR NUCLEAR DISARMAMENT. THE HUNDRED TWENTY TWO NATIONS THAT VOTED IN FAVOR OF ADOPTING THE TREATY ON THE PROHIBITION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS WERE COMPLYING WITH THEIR OBLIGATION TO ACT. THE U. S. WAS SHAMEFULLY HOSTILE TO THIS PROCESS THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE WORLD'S COUNTRIES ARE MOVING FORWARD TO OUTLAW IN STIGMATIZED NUCLEAR WEAPONS POSSESSION IN THE U. S. IS BEING LEFT BEHIND. THIS EMERGING LEGAL NORM AGAINST NUCLEAR WEAPONS WILL ONLY GET STRONGER. CALIFORNIA FOLLOWED BY THE ENTIRE UNITED STATES MUST GET ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF HISTORY. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY WE MUST DO EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER TO ELIMINATE NUCLEAR WEAPONS BEFORE THE ELIMINATE US [inaudible] THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING. I'M MARY LEAH KELLY I'M EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR TRI VALLEY CARES WERE A LIVERMORE CALIFORNIA BASED NONPROFIT WITH FIFTY SEVEN HUNDRED MEMBERS. TRI VALLEY CARES IS MONITORED NUCLEAR WEAPONS ACTIVITIES AT CALIFORNIA'S LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LAB FOR THIRTY FIVE YEARS. AND WE ARE UNIQUE IN THAT OUR MEMBERSHIP INCLUDES AND HAS ALWAYS INCLUDED SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS FROM THE LABORATORY WHICH IS ONE OF TWO LOCATIONS THAT DESIGNS EVERY NUCLEAR WEAPON IN THE UNITED STATES ARSENAL. I TOO HAD THE HONOR OF PARTICIPATING AT THE UNITED NATIONS AND NEGOTIATIONS FOR THE TREATY ON THE PROHIBITION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS LAST SUMMER. THE TREATY MAKES CLEAR THAT NUCLEAR WEAPONS POSE HORRIFIC HUMANITARIAN AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES THAT ARE LEGALLY AND MORALLY UNACCEPTABLE UNDER ALL CIRCUMSTANCES. THE TREATY WAS OVERWHELMINGLY ADOPTED BY ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO STATES PARTIES LAST YEAR. PUTTING THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD ON RECORD. SPEAKING IN A SINGLE VOICE THAT NUCLEAR WEAPONS ARE NO LONGER ACCEPTABLE. THIS IS HOW SOCIETAL PATTERNS ARE CHANGED. THIS IS HOW NATIONAL BEHAVIORS ARE CHANGED OVER TIME. BY VOTING TO PASS AJ OUR THIRTY THREE THIS COMMITTEE BECOMES AN INTEGRAL PART OF THIS GLOBAL SHIFT TO PUBLIC SAFETY BASED ON A NUCLEAR WEAPONS FREE WORLD FOR OUR CHILDREN AND FOR ALL WHO FOLLOW. IT'S RIGHT TIMELY AND FRANKLY THRILLING TO ME IS A CALIFORNIAN THAT MY STATE IS POISED TO TAKE A PRINCIPLED POSITION TO HELP ENSURE THAT NUCLEAR WEAPONS ARE NEVER AGAIN USED. THAT THE INTERNATIONAL TRADING ON THE PROHIBITION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS IS SUPPORTED. AND THAT THE ELIMINATION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS OCCURS AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE DATE. SO I WANT TO THANK YOU PERSONALLY AND FROM MY GROUP.

SIX NINE WHICH PROHIBITS THE PRESIDENT FROM UNILATERALLY ALL THE FOR AUTHORIZING THE OFFENSIVE USE OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS WITHOUT A CONGRESSIONAL DECLARATION OF WAR. UNDER CURRENT LAW THE PRESIDENT HAS THE SOLE AUTHORITY TO ORDER THE USE OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS WITH NO OUTSIDE REVIEW REQUIRED. HERE SHE MAY CONSULT WITH CONGRESS BUT IS NOT REQUIRED TO DO SO. IF ANY PRESIDENT BORDERS AN OFFENSIVE NUCLEAR ATTACK ON ANY OTHER NUCLEAR POWER. THE RESPONSE WOULD BE AN IMMEDIATE COUNTERATTACKS RESULTING IN UNSPEAKABLE AMERICAN CASUALTIES. HR SIX SIX NINE WOULD FIX THIS THREAT BY MAKING SURE CONGRESS HAS A SAY IN SOMETHING THAT COULD IMPACT EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN THE UNITED STATES.

MY ORGANIZATION HAS WORKED THROUGHOUT IT'S NEARLY FIFTY YEAR HISTORY TO REDUCE THE RE ON URGENT THREAT. OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS WHICH TO THIS DAY POSES AN EXISTENTIALIST THREAT. TO ALL OF HUMANITY AS WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING THIS MORNING. TODAY IT NEARLY FIFTEEN THOUSAND NUCLEAR WEAPONS REMAIN ON THE PLANET. MOST POSSESSED BY THE U. S. IN RUSSIA. IN A DETONATION OF EVEN AT RELATIVELY FEW OF THEM COULD LEAD TO CATASTROPHIC HUMAN ECOLOGICAL AND ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES. GRAVELY AFFECTING EVERY SINGLE PERSON ON THE PLANET. UNDER THE CURRENT PROCEDURES AS WAS JUST DISCUSSED THE PRESIDENT UNITED STATES HAS SOUL AND UNCHECKED AUTHORITY TO USE THE ORDER THE USE OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS. THE SYSTEM IS RISKY. UNNECESSARY AND UNJUSTIFIED. AND WITH THAT MIND YOU SEE S. WHOLEHEARTEDLY AGREES THAT NO PERSON. THIS PRESIDENT NOR ANY OTHER. SHOULD HAVE THE SOLE UNCHECKED AUTHORITY TO ORDER THE FIRST USE OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS. THERE ARE PRACTICAL WAYS TO INCLUDE MULTIPLE DECISION MAKERS. IN ORDERING ANY USE OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS THE UNITED STATES SHOULD ADOPT SUCH CHANGES. THE SIMPLE FACT IS WE DON'T WANT NUCLEAR WEAPONS TO EVER AGAIN BE USED AS THEY WERE USED BY UNITED STATES SEVENTY THREE YEARS AGO. THIS RESOLUTION AND MANY OTHER LOCAL AND STATE INITIATIVES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY ARE SENDING A POWERFUL SIGNAL TO WASHINGTON THAT WE MUST QUICKLY CHANGE COURSE. AND URGENTLY WORK TO REDUCE THE NUMBER AND ROLE OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS IN OUR SECURITY POLICY. AND FUNDAMENTALLY REFORM U. S. NUCLEAR WEAPONS POLICY. ENDING THIS SOLE AUTHORITY POLICY IS JUST ONE OF MANY CRITICAL CHANGES -- IN U. S. NUCLEAR WEAPONS POLICY THAT ARE NECESSARY TO REDUCE THE REAL AN URGENT THREAT OF THESE WEAPONS -- AND WE THANK YOU ALL FOR CONSIDERING THIS RESOLUTION TODAY AND FOR BRINGING ATTENTION LEADERSHIP THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE.
