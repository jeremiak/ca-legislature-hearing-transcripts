ADDRESS AND TRYING TO AND A FIVE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE COLLABORATION SIMILARLY ALSO MET WITH THE MY DISTRICT ATTORNEY IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY INCLUDE YOUR- SPECIFICALLY IN HAD HOURS OF CONVERSATIONS I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE IT AS WELL BUT IT JUST GOES TO THE DUE DILIGENCE THAT YOU CHEN. CARE ABOUT THAT AND MUCH APPRECIATED. THIS IS A VERY IN NOW NARROWLY TAILORED. EL AL WITH RESPECT TO PACKAGE THAT SAID I THINK WE'VE ALL- SEEING OR HAVE BEEN VICTIMS OF PORCH THEFT WITH THE ADVENT OF NEW DELIVERIES- TO OUR HOMES ESPECIALLY DURING THE HOLIDAY SEASONS ABOUT MEMBERS THIS IS NOT JUST- AN ISSUE THAT IMPACTS A WEALTHY COMMUNITIES IN FACT IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN A REPORT BY FOR PACKAGING ON AMAZON PACKAGE THAT'S- SHOWED SIX. OF THE TWENTY TOP CITIES IN THE UNITED STATES WERE IN CALIFORNIA SIX OF THE TOP TWENTY CITY SAN FRANCISCO NUMBER ONE OAKLAND SACRAMENTO SAN JOSE LOS ANGELES AND LONG BEACH SO WE WERE VERY MUCH. TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. EVERY DAY TO. THE SPECTRUM- AND THIS MAKES AN INTENSE- TO IDENTIFY THIS ISSUE AT HAND I WITH ME TODAY'S JEFF RUBIN WITH THE SANTA CLARA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE AS WELL AS TIFFANY MATHIS WITH THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU YOU MAY BEGIN. CHAIRPERSON MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE STUDENT HIS ARM I HAVE A COLD AND SO YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTESALL TOGETHER WITH THE WAY YOU YOU PARSE IT OUT. OKAY WHEN AB TWELVE TEN WAS ORIGINALLY INTRODUCED IT WAS IN RESPONSE TO A GROWING PROBLEM. SOMETHING LIKE OVER ONE THIRD OF AMERICANS HAVE EXPERIENCED AT LEAST ONE THEFT FROM THEIR DOORSTEP. OUR. ACCORDING TO A RECENT CBS REPORT CALIFORNIA HAS THE WORST THEFT PORCH THEFT PROBLEM IN AMERICA 30% OF THE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF PACKAGES THAT ARE BEING TAKEN OCCUR HERE IN CALIFORNIA. PORCH PIRACY WHICH WE USES ARE SORT OF A SHORTHAND FOR COMING ONTO THE CURTILAGE OF THE HOME AND STEALING A PACKAGE IS NOT LIKE DANGERS THAT ARE NOT PRESENT AND DOES NOT HAVE THE SAME TYPE OF. IT'S NOT A SITUATION WHERE SOMEONE MIGHT BE DETERRED FROM GOING INTO A STORE WHERE THERE'S OTHER PEOPLE AROUND. PORCH PIRACY IS A CRIME WHERE. IT IS EASY THESE PACKAGES ARE EASY PICKINGS THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY. IT'S EXPLODED. AND SO BECAUSE IT'S SUCH EASY PICKINGS BECAUSE WE HAD THIS EXPLOSION WE NEED SOME SORT OF DETERRENCE. NO. WHEN THE BILL WAS INITIALLY INTRODUCED. IT JUST REQUIRED SOMEONE TO COME ON TO SOMEONE ELSE'S PROPERTY WITH THE INTENT TO STEAL. WHAT THEY EVEN TOOK THE PACKAGE IS NOT DETERMINED IF ALTHOUGH OBVIOUSLY IT'S GONNA BE VERY DIFFICULT TO PROVE UNLESS WE CAN SHOW A PACKAGE WAS TAKEN. THE BILL WAS A VERY MEASURED AND REASONABLE RESPONSE ESPECIALLY COMPARED TO BILLS IN OTHER STATES THAT HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED AND OR PASSED. IT SIMPLY ALLOWS THE PROSECUTION IN CERTAIN CERTAIN CERTAIN FOR CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES TO CHARGE A FELONY DOES NOT HAVE TO BE CHARGED WITH A FELONY. A JUDGE CAN MAKE A DETERMINATION HEY I'M NOT GOING TO ALLOW IT TO GO FORWARD AS A FELONY. AND SERVE IT WHATEVER THE MAXIMUM PUNISHMENT WOULD BE WOULD STILL BE SERVED IN LOCAL JAIL. SO WILL THIS BILL DO TURKEY THE THOUSANDS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF POTENTIAL INDIVIDUALS WHO MIGHT BE COMMITTING THIS CRIME. IT'S NOT GOING TO DETER EVERYBODY CHANGING AT CHANGING UP THE PUNISHMENT TO ALLOW FOR A FELONY PUNISHMENT IN THIS CIRCUMSTANCE IS NOT GOING TO DETER INDIVIDUALS WHO MIGHT OTHERWISE BE DETERRED BY A MISDEMEANOR OFFENSE. IT'S ONLY GOING TO HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL LIMITED DETERRENT EFFECT. BUT BECAUSE THERE RE MILLIONS OF THESE CRIMES BEING COMMITTED EVEN IF JUST ONE OUT OF TEN PEOPLE ARE DETERRED FROM COMMITTING THIS CRIME THAT MEANS THOUSANDS OF INDIVIDUALS. ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE TO. HAVE PACKAGES TAKEN FROM THEIR HOME% THEY'RE NOT GONNA HAVE THE RISK OF SOMEONE COMING UP TO THEIR HOUSE AND THEN POTENTIALLY CAUSING. PHYSICAL INJURY TO THE PERSON WHO'S TRYING TO TAKE THE PACKAGE OR BEING PHYSICALLY INJURED THEMSELVES. SO. WHEN THIS WAS ORIGINALLY INTRODUCED. IT ADDRESSED IT IN WHAT WE BELIEVED WAS THE BEST WAY. SINCE THE- IN ADDITION TO MADE. THAT LIMIT THE DETERRENT VALUE. WE NOW HAVE A LIMITATION IN THE CURRENT BILL OF NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS. THAT IS. NOT GOING TO COVER A LOT OF THE PACKAGE THAT'S THAT OCCURRED SOMEONE CAN CAN COMMIT TEN OR TWENTY PACKAGE STEPS BEFORE THEY GET TO THAT LIMIT DEPENDING ON WHAT THE ITEM IS AND THE VALUE OF THE ITEM IN THE PACKAGE. FOR THE DETERRENCE VALUE IS FURTHER LIMITED. BECAUSE WE HAVE TO SHOW A CATCH SO MANY ACT ONCE YOU HAVE TO TAKE MORE THAN ONE PACKAGE AND THE TOTAL HAS TO BE MORE THAN NINE HUNDRED FIFTY. THE DETERRENCE VALUE IS DIMINISHED EVEN FURTHER BECAUSE- IT HAS TO BE UP TO A HUNDRED NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY. IT HAS TO HAVE. MORE THAN ONE OF THEM. AND IT HAS TO OCCUR WITHIN TWELVE MONTH PERIOD. THE DETERRENT VALUE IS FURTHER DIMINISHED WHEN ALL THOSE CRITERIA HAVE TO BE MET AND WE HAVE TO PROVE THAT. IT WAS DONE IN CONCERT. CAN BE VERY DIFFICULT TO. OF CAPTURE ALL THESE INDIVIDUALS WHO. ARE COMMITTING THE STAFFS AND COMING UP TO THE PORCH. IF YOU HAVE THAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO USE OF EVERYONE'S TIME I'M SORRY SO. ACTUALLY YOU USED UP EVERYONE'S TIME SO I'LL GIVE YOU LIMÃ³N DID COULD YOU WRAP UP SO I CAN HEAR FROM THE OTHER WITNESSES TOLD ME JUST. NOW WE CAN SHOP WITH A- WE CAN CHARGE. SOMEONE WHO COMMITS A CONSPIRACY. TO STEAL A PACKAGE WITH A FELONY READY SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE A NEW CRIME THAT IN THAT INCREASES THE DETERRENTS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING TERRY MEMBERS TIFFANY MATTHEWS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION AND IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I WOULD JUST LIKE TO ECHO THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE MISTER RUBIN AND I JUST WANT TO CAUTION THE COMMITTEE THAT THESE AMENDMENTS WATER DOWN THE BILL SO MUCH THAT IT MAKES IT ALMOST EFFECTIVELY USELESS I'M A PROSECUTOR IN STANDPOINT BUT WE DEAL OR TO WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND TRY TO FIND CONSENSUS WHERE WE CAN ALL AGREE ON. A OPTION TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE IS REASONS WHY THE A. B. TOLD ME PASSED IN ITS ORIGINAL FORM. YES GOOD MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS STAND FILLS OUT ON BEHALF OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE THE PROBLEM OF PUSH BARS IS A GROWING PROBLEM IN LOS ANGELES SPECIAL BECAUSE OF THE DENSITY IN THE MULTI FAMILY HOUSING UNITS- WHICH MAKES PORTS PIRACY ALTHOUGH MUCH EASIER- WE SHARE THE CONCERNS EXPRESSED AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH PEOPLE US TO MOVE FORWARD. THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANY OTHER. IN OPPOSITION BUT I MEAN IT'S SUPPORT OR WHATEVER. IN BETWEEN- AT YOU CAME UP I WAS COMPOUNDED BIRTHDAY THANK YOU. RYAN RIVERSIDE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION SUPPORT THAT YOU THANK YOU. MR MEMBERS IVAN ALTAMURA BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA RETAILERS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU SIR. MORNING MR JR MEMBERS COURCELLES OF ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION SUPPORT THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN GRAHAM WARD PRESIDENT OF CBS AMADOR COUNTY SHERIFF'S EMPLOYEE BENEFIT ASSOCIATION ALSO IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. ANY ANY ANYWHERE ELSE IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU ARE ANY IN OPPOSITION. RIGHT THANK YOU MORNING AND HAPPY BIRTHDAY THANK YOU A MARK OF GEORGE FROM THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION- I THANK THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER LOW AND THE STAFF FOR THE AMENDMENTS- HOWEVER SADLY WE'RE STILL OPPOSED TO THE READY THE PART THAT MAKES US A FELONY AND- AS A CITIZEN OF THE NUMBER TWO CITY IN THE OF LIST OF- COUNTIES OR MUNICIPALITIES THAT HAVE BEEN VANDALIZED- I STILL THINK THAT THIS IS UNNECESSARY. ID ADVOCATES THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORMS IN THE ATTEMPT WE'VE HAD TO REVERSE MASS INCARCERATION ALSO AS MR RUBIN POINTS OUT THIS IS NOT A DETERRENT AND IT WOULD MAKE A FELONY THE SORT OF THE FOLLOWING CIRCUMSTANCES IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD I IN MANY OF MY NEIGHBORS ORDER GROCERIES FROM SAFE WAY AND OTHER- IS TO CART AND THOSE BILLS FREQUENTLY RUN TO TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS IN ORDER ON THERE ARE HOMELESS PEOPLE THAT LIVE FOUR FIVE BLOCKS FROM MY HOUSE WITH CHILDREN. IF OF THOSE PEOPLE COME ON MY PORCH AND STEAL THE GROCERIES UNDER THE AMBIT OF THESE THIS LONG THEY WOULD BE ACTING IN CONCERT AND COULD QUICKLY COMPILE WHAT COULD AMOUNT TO A FELONY I THINK THIS IS NECESSARY CAN BE PROSECUTED UNDER OTHER LOS UNDER IT YOU KNOW IF IT'S APPROPRIATE AND FOR THOSE REASONS. WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NO PHONE. MORNING MR CHAIR HAVE SAYING GOOD MORNING MEMBERS HAPPY NEW YEAR- MIKE A DOCTOR OFF ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA WE TO APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S ADVERTS TO NARROW THE SCOPE OF THE BILL AND APPRECIATE THAT STAFF'S EFFORTS AS WELL UNFORTUNATELY WE REMAIN OPPOSED- I WOULD ECHO THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE AND ALSO. JUST ADD- ALONG THE SAME LINES AS WHAT SHE WAS DESCRIBING THAT WERE CONCERNED THAT A. B. TWELVE TEN COULD BE USED AS A TOOL TO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST HOMELESS PEOPLE PEOPLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS AND PEOPLE OF COLOR IN PARTICULAR WE FEAR THAT THE BILL COULD BE USED AS A- STE. ARREST PEOPLE AGAIN. AND FOR PROPERTY OWNERS ARE EITHER EXPLICITLY OR IMPLICITLY BIASED PEOPLE WHO THEY BELIEVE DO NOT BELONG IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD ON WHILE THESE ISSUES OF DISCRIMINATION ARE AND BIAS ALREADY OCCURRED TODAY WE FEAR THAT THE CREATION OF A NEW CRIME WILL ONLY EXACERBATE THAT PROBLEM ON AND LSTLY I WOULD SAY- YOU KNOW TO THE EXTENT THAT PACKAGE THAT CRIMES ARE NOT BEING PROSECUTED TODAY TO THE EXTENT THAT EXISTING CRIMES ARE NOT SERVING AS A DETERRENT. THAT IS A MATTER OF ENFORCEMENT NOT A MATTER OF NEEDING A NEW CRIME- AND SO WITH THAT- I ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE THANK YOU THANK YOU. OR ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. SUSAN GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN VERS ACOSTA HERNANDEZ ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEYS FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE STATEWIDE ASSOCIATION PREVENTS ATTORNEYS PRIVATE PRACTICE AND PUBLIC DEFENDER OFFICES WE ARE OPPOSED TO THE BILL- IMPRINT AND ALSO THE EVEN AS AMENDED A PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED. A CONTAINED IN THE ANALYSIS- LET'S REMEMBER THAT THIS WOULD BE IN KANSAS OUR NAMING ORGANIZATION I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE PART OF THE PHONE MAIL AS WAS WHO ARE AT TEN MINUTES MY POLY DOES DO TENANTS TO DO FIVE BUT GO AHEAD I THAT IS A TEN. MY APOLOGIES I'LL MAKE A VERY BRIEF IT IS INCONSISTENT WITH THE VOTER. VOTER APPROVED INITIATIVES I THINK WE HAVE TO KEEP THAT IN MIND THAT'S WHY THE LAW IS WHAT IT IS TODAY BECAUSE OF VOTERS A CALIFORNIA DECIDED THAT'S WHAT SHOULD BE WHERE THE THRESHOLD SHOULD BE THE OTHER THING TO KEEP IN MIND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THESE TYPES OF THAT. IT IS AN ENFORCEMENT ISSUE THE OTHER THING IS WE HAVE A DOLLAR AMOUNT ON THIS IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT IN RETAIL BECAUSE YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT'S IN THE PACKAGE. SO NOW WE'RE NOW GOING TO POTENTIALLY CREATE A FELONY FOR SOMEONE WHO MAYBE DID EVEN AND TAMMY WAS A SMALL PACKAGE I THOUGHT WAS GOING TO BE A SMALL AMOUNT TURNS OUT TO BE SOMETHING LARGER. A LOT OF HOMES WITH IT BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY IT'S GONNA REMIND INS VENT THE VOTER APPROVED INITIATIVE. IS REASON. TO TAKE FOR THE TOP. THE BOOK OF. IN VISIT. YEAH BRING. BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS THERE'S- ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS I HAVE A COMMENT. FIRST OF ALL I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR A- ACTUALLY RECOGNIZING A PROBLEM IT'S A VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM FOR MANY PEOPLE AND- I AND- AS WAS ECHOED BY SOME OF THE COMMENTS ALREADY WISH THAT IT DID GO FURTHER I KNOW YOU'RE TEMPTED FOR THAT. BUT IT IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND- I JUST A- I'M EXTREMELY FRUSTRATED BY. THE REALITIES THAT THAT SOME OF OUR LEGISLATION IS A RELEASE TO THEFT HAS RESULTED I JUST WANT TO SHARE VERY BRIEF STORY BECAUSE IT'S VERY REAL AND IT. IT TELLS. THE REAL CIRCUMSTANCES WERE DEALING WITH AS A SOCIETY. I AM A VERY CLOSE. PERSON WHO JUST SHARED WITH ME WHO WORKS IN RETAIL. AND THEY WORK IN A MALL IN MY DISTRICT AND- THIS PERSON HAPPENS TO BE A DOESN'T HAS SOME PLAY THAT THAT CAME TO ME. THEN SHE INDICATED TO ME THE FRUSTRATION SHE HAD BECAUSE- WHERE SHE WORKS THERE IS. A COUPLE OF PEOPLE THAT WERE- GATHERING CLOTHING AND CREATED TO ARM FULLS OF CLOTHING. AND PROCEEDED TO WALK OUT THE ALARMS WENT OFF. AND SHE LOOKED AT HER MANAGER AND HER MANAGER SHOOK HER HEAD NO. AND LET HER GO LET THEM GO SHE SAID THERE WAS PROBABLY THREE OR FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS OF CLOTHING. THAT'S THE MESSAGE THAT IS PERMEATING RIGHT NOW THAT THERE'S NO ACTION BEING TAKEN. AND THE PENDULUM HAS SWUNG WAY TOO FAR THE OTHER WAY. AND I DO BELIEVE IN BALANCE AND WE'RE IN A VERY VERY IMBALANCED CIRCUMSTANCE RIGHT NOW. BUT I. I HARDLY SUPPORT THIS BECAUSE IT'S A PORTION OF JUSTICE THAT OUR SOCIETY IS STARVING FOR. AND ONE OF THE COMMENTS MENTIONED INITIATIVES STAND BY. TWENTY TWENTY THERE IS GONNA BE AN INITIATIVE TO TRY TO BALANCE THIS OUT AND- WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. OKAY YOU MAY CLOSE IT MR RESTORE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I JUST WANT TO A SUMMER AS BY STATING THAT THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT I THINK WE ALL KNOW SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN A VICTIM IN FACT WITH THE ADVENT OF TECHNOLOGY EVEN WITH RING AND THE OTHERS YOU HAVE THE EVIDENCE IN WHICH PERPETRATORS KNOW THAT THEY CAN GET AWAY WITH THIS- BUT THIS IS JUST A SMALL STEP TO SAY THIS IS THE FIRST POLICY HEARING AND WORKING WITH THE CHAIR TO CONTINUE TO TRY TO DRIVE THE ISSUE FORWARD. AND WAS ALSO KNOWN THAT- THE VICE TO THIS VICE CHAIR THIS IS ALSO SPONSORED BY THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY THERE WERE TWO DISTRICT ATTORNEYS THAT WENT ON THE ROAD IN SUPPORT OF PROP FORTY SEVEN- SO THIS BY NO MEANS IS ANY ATTEMPT TO LOOK AT- SOME OF THE ARGUMENTS THAT YOU HEARD ABOUT A DISPROPORTIONATE HURTING OTHER COMMUNITIES OF COLOR RAPPER. HAVING A CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW WE THOUGHT. CRITICS FOR THE CONVERSATION AND ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES WORKING WITH THE CHAIR. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE AS THIS LEAVES THE FIRST POLICY. COMMITTEE AND HOPE THAT WE CAN FIND TO SOME ACCOMMODATION ACCORDINGLY. AND AS CHAIR I WANT TO THANK. ON THE AUTHOR FOR WORKING WITH- COMMITTEE COMMITTEE STAFF OF AND THE CHAIR OF I'VE MADE A COMMITMENT. TO WORK WITH YOU TO TRY TO FIND THAT BALANCE. IT'S KIND OF IRONIC THAT. BOTH SIDES HAITI MEMBERS WHICH SOUNDS GOOD TO ME- AND THAT THEY'RE NOT FULLY ON BOARD WHICH IS WHY. HOPEFULLY IT STARTS TO CONVERSATION BECAUSE TRYING TO DRIVE THAT BALANCE BETWEEN ACTUALLY. GOING AFTER PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING THIS ON A CONSISTENT BASIS- FOR A GUEST BOOK PROFIT IS WHAT WERE THEY THINKING AS OPPOSED TO TRYING TO FIND. AND I WILL USE ON ONE HAND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MAYBE DETERRENTS FOR PEOPLE. WHO ARE CRIMINALS WHO WANT TO DO THIS AS OPPOSED TO PEOPLE WHO ARE AT THE POVERTY LEVEL OR BECAUSE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES HOW COME WE BUY THEM A JOB. HOW CAN WE GET HIM OFF DRUGS HOW CAN WE MAKE SURE THAT THEY DOESN'T REOCCUR. I DON'TTHINK THEIR MUTUAL EXCUSE SCHOOLS OF AND I THINK THAT'S BEEN. I THINK THAT'S BEEN OUR CHALLENGE OF HOW CAN YOU BLEND. THE TWO IN A IN A SEVENTY TWO WAY AND SO- I LOOK AT THIS BILL AND WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW. AS MAYBE THE START. OF BRIDGING THAT SO WE DON'T HAVE TO GO TO ABOUT SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO CONSTANTLY GO BACK AND FORTH WITH ONE ANOTHER- ESPECIALLY WHEN I HEAR BOTH SIDES SAY THE SAME THING. THAT WE DO NEED TO COME UP WITH. AVENUES TO HELP PEOPLE. WHO ARE ON DRUGS WHO MAY BE A MOTHER WHO HAS TO FEED THEIR KIDS. WILL WE SHOULDN'T CRIMINALIZED THEM AND EXPECT THEM. TO BE ABLE TO GET OUT OF THE POVERTY CYCLE BY PUTTING A FELONY ON THEM AND THEN SAY OH YEAH YOU'LL BE ABLE TO COME BACK IN SOCIETY AND BE ABLE. TO SURVIVE BUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN IS. THEY WILL BE ABLE TO RENT AN APARTMENT THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO GET A JOB IF YOU YOUNG YOU WILL BE ABLE TO. JOIN THE MILITARY I MEAN AS A WHOLE ONCE YOU GET A- FELONY ON YOU. YOUR LIFE SPIRALS. INTO THE SCHOOL PRINT WHICH I KNOW THAT'S NOT. YOUR INTENT. AND THAT'S NOT WHAT I THINK THE D. A.'S OFFICE. AS I SAID I DON'T THINK- PEOPLE ONLY ASIDE. WHILE ON THE OTHER SIDE. WE DO HAVE TO PROSECUTE PEOPLE. AND WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THOSE THAT WANT TO BECOME CRIMINALS I WANT TO BE CRIMINAL. THAT DESK THEIR SOLE CONCERN IS TO DO THAT AND BECOME A PLAGUE ON THE SOCIETY. WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO DETER THEM. OR THE HOLD THEM OR KEEP THEM AWAY FROM SOCIETY SO HOW DO YOU CREATE. THAT BALANCE AND THAT'S WHAT I MAKE THAT'S KIND OF THE PLANE BILL WERE ON AND SO I'M HOPING THAT WE CAN ALL GET INTO ROOM. AND UNDERSTAND THIS IS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET TO THIS IS WHERE OUR ASPIRATIONS ARE. AND MAYBE YOUR BILL MISTER LOW. TO BE TH OPENING- FOR THAT AND THAT'S WHY NOW WE ARE SUPPORTING IT- I'M- I'M OPTIMISTIC THAT WHEN WE GET TO THAT PLACE- NOT ONLY BOTH SIDES STILL DON'T LIKE BUT WE MAY START THE DISCUSSION OF HOW WE CAN BRIDGE THE GAP. BETWEEN REALLY AREN'T SMART AND CRIED AND TOUGH ON CRIME. THANK I WITH THAT TEACHERS RECOMMEND AN AYE VOTE. ON A. B. TWELVE TEN THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER JONES SAWYER AYE LACKEY. LACKEY I BAUER-KAHAN BACK HE HAD I DEEP. DEEP I KAMLAGER. KAMLAGER NOT BOATING QUIRK QUIRK AYE SANTIAGO SANTIAGO I WICKS. MEASURE THE MEASURE PASSES THANK YOU H. OUR- AB NINE OH FOUR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'D LIKE TO START OFF BY THANKING YOU MISTER CHAIR AND ALSO MEMBERS OF YOUR STAFF- FOR THEIR HELP US TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE OPPOSITION SO CONCERNS TO THAT END I HAVE AGREED TO AMEND THE BILL IN THE PRIVACY COMMITTEE TO READ AS FOLLOWS. THE REFERENCE TO SOFTWARE IS NOT INTENDED TO EXPAND THE AUTHORITY OF THE GOVERNMENT ENTITY TO USE SOFTWARE FOR SURVEILLANCE PURPOSES UNDER THE CHAPTER OR ANY OTHER LAW. THIS BILL AB NINE OH FOUR IS CURRENTLY IN PRINT SEEKS TO ENSURE THAT GOVERNMENT ENTITIES CANNOT USE TRACKING SOFT WORD THAT PERMITS THE TRACKING OF MOVEMENT OF A PERSON OR- OBJECT WITHOUT A WARRANT. CURRENT LAW REQUIRES WHICH WARNED SO TO BE USED. MR INSTALLING A TRACKING DEVICE WAS SERVING A WARRANT ON A THIRD PARTY POSSESSOR OFF THE TRACKING DATA. HOWEVER WITH NEW TECHNOLOGY IT IS NO LONGER NECESSARY FOR AN OFFICER TO MAKE ANY PHYSICAL CONTACT WITH THE DEVICE PERSON OR VEHICLE TO INSTALL SUCH A DEVICE IN ORDER TO TRACK AN INDIVIDUAL ON THE CONTRARY THEY SIMPLY NEED TO HOW OF WIRELESS ACCESS TO DOWNLOAD TRACKING SOFT WORD THAT WILL PROVIDE INVESTIGATORS WITH. THE INFORMATION THAT THESE. OUR BECAUSE CURRENT LAW THIS EXPLICITLY DEFINED DEVICE. BUT TELL THERE IS AMBIGUITY IN THE SURROUNDING LANGUAGE THAT IT MUST BE ATTACHED TO AN OBJECT OR SOMETHING. OUR SUCH AS A MECHANICAL DEVICE SO THIS BILL WOULD CLARIFY THAT A TRACKING DEVICE INCLUDES ANY SOFT WORD THAT PERMITS THE TRACKING OF THE MOVEMENT OF A PERSON. OR OBJECT FOR PURPOSES OF THE STATUTE ALSO THE OPPOSITION HOUSE- RAISED THE CONCERN THAT WE ARE GRANTING NEW POWERS TO GOVERNMENT AND HE'S- QUITE THE CONTRARY THE AMENDMENTS THAT I REFERENCED EARLIER WILL ADDRESS THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE. IF IT DOES NOT ARE. ACTIVELY ENGAGED WITH THE OPTION TO OUR LOOK AT THE ISSUE CLOSELY AS WE PROGRESS SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR EITHER. THANK YOU. YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES YOU CAN USE IT ALL. BUT YOUR YOUR FIVE. THIS IS YOUR NUMBER. BECAUSE OF THE LATE IN AS WE HAVEN'T. WE DON'T HAVE AN OFFICIAL SUPPORT POSITION ON THE LEGISLATION THAT. THIS WE DON'T HAVE OFFICIAL- SUPPORT POSITION ON THE LEGISLATION YET HOWEVER- TALKING WITH- ARE EXPERTS IN OUR OFFICE ON GPS TRACKING SOFTWARE TRACKING SEARCH WARRANTS OUR OFFICE BELIEVES THAT NOT ONLY IS THIS APPROPRIATE BUT THIS IS THE POLICY IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY OF LAW ENFORCEMENT COMES AND WISHES TO. TRACK THE MOVEMENTS OF AN INDIVIDUAL WHETHER. IT WOULD BE DONE VIA SOFTWARE OR A MORE TRADITIONAL- MECHANICAL DEVICES PLACED ON A CAR OR OTHER OBJECT- WE REQUIRE LAW ENFORCEMENT TO GET A SEARCH WARRANT FOR THAT WE BELIEVE THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE SUPREME COURT. A RECENT DECISION ON THE SPOT AND FOR THAT REASON I RECOMMEND SUPPORT AND OUR OFFICE HOPES TO SUPPORT THIS BILL VERY SOON. IS THERE ANY OTHER. ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. QUIRK. SHE LET'S SEE SO CALM I THINK WE JUST GOT SOMEBODY COMING UP FOR OUR DECISION IN AN OPPOSITE IN OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING MR GOOD MORNING AND MEMBERS AND HAPPY NEW YEAR AND HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU BUT A HAPPY GOING AROUND. I COUNTY SHERIFF FOR THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA- WE RESPECTFULLY MISSED OPPOSED EIGHTY NINE OH FOR- I WANNA STEP I THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER TH&lt;c.cyan&gt; AND HIS STAFF FOR THEIR&lt;/c&gt; OPENNESS AND DISCUSSING OUR CONCERNS WITH THIS BILL- WE CERTAINLY SHARE THE AIM OF MAKING SURE THAT CALIFORNIANS ARE PROTECTED AGAINST UNLAWFUL SEARCH AND SEIZURE AND- FORWARD TO CONTINUING. FIND THE WAY THAT AIM. THIS IN CALIFORNIA LAW IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER FORSMAN HAS AUTHORITY UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES TO REMOTELY ACCESS AND INDIVIDUALS ELECTRONIC DEVICE IN ORDER TO MONITOR THE INDIVIDUALS ACTIVITY THE CURRENT LANGUAGE OF EIGHTY NINE- FORCED TO EXPRESSLY AUTHOR SUCH REMOTE ACCESS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN CALIFORNIA LAW. ARE THE DANGER OF SUCH AUTHORIZATION ARE CLEAR. ON FORCED KIND OF TOOL AND ACCESS TO INFORMATION THAT ARE BEYOND LOCATION INFORMATION INSTALLING SOFTWARE TO MONITOR A PERSON'S ACTIVITY ON THEIR PHONE OR EVEN TO USE THE PHONE'S MICROPHONE AND CAMERA TO SPY ON THE PERSON- MOREOVER IF LAW ENFORCEMENT BEGINS TO DEVELOP AND USE TOOLS TO EXPLOIT THE IN VULNERABILITIES AND GAIN REMOTE ACCESS IT IS SIR THE SAME TOOLS BY OTHER ACTORS WITH FAR LESS BENEVOLENT GOALS IN THE PROTECTION OF PUBLIC SAFETY. AGAIN WITH A NUMBER FOR ENGAGE WITH THIS ISSUE AND LOOK FOR MORE TO DATE HOWEVER WE ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE. THANK YOU. YES MISTER CHAIR MEMBER SAMANTHA CORBIN WITH THE ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION I'D AFFILIATE MY COMMENTS WITH OTHER CONCERNS EXPRESSED BY OUR COLLEAGUES AT THE ACLU OF THE ANALYSIS DOES RIGHTFULLY POINT OUT PARTICULARLY IN SECTION FOUR- THE- OF OUR CONCERNS WE HAVE BEEN IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE REGARDING AMENDMENTS. I WHICH DOES APPEAR HE INTENDS TO TAKE- AND WILL CONTINUE THOSE CONVERSATION SHOULD THE BILL MOVE FORWARD TODAY. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. YES MISS COME LUGGAGE BEAU IS RIGHT MISTER QUIRK STARTED. WELL MISTER CHAIR I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT- BILL GO FORWARD SO THAT WE CAN MAKE IT CLEAR THAT SOMEBODY CAN'T DOWNLOAD SOFTWARE TO MY PHONE AND- THAT YOUR INTENTION AND I THINK IT'S A VERY GOOD ONE AND- SHOULD THEY COME UP WITH BETTER LANGUAGE THEN YOU ARE HAVE I KNOW YOU'LL TAKE IT SO I'D LIKE TO MOVE THE BELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MUST COME AUGUST OF YEAH THANK YOU AND HAPPY NEW YEAR- MR CHOW I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE BEEN A VERY STAUNCH ADVOCATE FOR. PRIVACY ISSUES AND SO I- HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE- CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED BY THE ACLU- AND THE ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION WILL BE ADDRESSED- IN YOUR COMMITTEE. THE AND I WAS ACTUALLY CONFUSED BY SOME OF THE CONCERNS BECAUSE AS I READ THE BILL IT WAS JUST LOOKING TO SORT OF RE DEAF. TRACK VICE IS GIVEN ARE SORT OF EVOLUTION. THE EXISTENCE OF SOFTWARE AND YET THE CONCERNS AROUND THE POTENTIALLY EXPANSIVE NATURE OF IT I SEE WHERE THERE IS GIVEN PAUSE SO I ALSO AM HOPING THAT LANGUAGE SORT OF CAN BE. MORE NARROWLY DEFINE- SO THAT WE ARE NOT CREATING AN END RUN AROUND THE ABILITY- TO TRACK PEOPLE AND THE EXAMPLE THAT CAME TO MY MIND WAS WHAT HAPPENED IN LOS ANGELES WITH LA D. O. T. AND SCOOTERS AND ESPECIALLY USING SOFTWARE. TO TRACK THE MOVEMENT OF USERS AND ONE ENTITY IS SAYING WELL IT'S ALLOWING US TO SORT OF MONITOR CONGESTION AND TRAFFIC AND ANOTHER ENTITY IS SAYING YES BUT ALSO- INVADING FOLKS IS RIGHT PRIVACY YOU'RE HAVING AN ABILITY TO TRACK WITHOUT NEEDING A SEARCH WARRANT AND SO WITH FUZZY. IN THE BILL THAT I THINK WHAT REYES- THOUGH- OPPOSE SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL IN HOPES THAT WILL BE ADDRESSED IN THE SCREEN COMMITTEE THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS A YOU MAY CLOSE MISTER JOHN. LAST ARRIVAL THANK YOU AND I AND I WANT TO THANK YOU MR CHOW FOR WORKING WITH OUR COMMITTEE ONCE WE BROUGHT UP THE CONCERNS OF THE OPPOSITION YOU IMMEDIATELY WORKED ON THIS WITH OUR LAWYERS AND OUR STAFF AND- BUT I KNOW WE WORK REAL HARD TO CRAFT SOMETHING WE THOUGHT. WOULD MEET THEIR CONCERNS- LIKE ANYTHING WHEN YOU GET ABOUT HOURS IN ROME YOU DON'T ALWAYS GET TO A CONCLUSION SO I'M HOPING THAT. D. EIGHT OFFICE ALONG WITH THE ACO. BECAUSE THE DA'S OFFICE HAS CONCERNS AND THE ACO HAVE CONCERNS AND IT SEEMS TO BE ALL ABOUT IMPLEMENTATION. HOW IS IT ULTIMATELY IMPLEMENTED- AND I KNOW THE ONLY WAY AND CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG THE ONLY WAY THAT. THIS CAN BE ACTIVATED THEY HAVE TO GET A SEARCH WARRANT TO THE DA'S OFFICE SO IT IS CRITICAL. THAT AT THE LAWYERS FROM THE OPPOSITION MEET WITH OF THE SUPPORTERS AND MAYBE WE LOCK THEM IN A ROW AB HAVING HELP HASH OUT THE FINAL WORDING AS WE MOVE FORWARD SPECIAL WHEN YOU GO TO JUDICIARY. WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE ALL THE LAWYERS TALKING THEN I WOULD I WOULD IF I WERE YOU WORK IT OUT BEFORE. SELECT COMMITTEE. COULD NOT GET TOO MANY LAWYERS TALKING ABOUT THIS. SO OF. MY RECOMMENDATION ADAM- THAT WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS AND- ESPECIALLY SINCE ROLLING. I NOTICED A BIG ISSUE BUT IT'S JUST ONE ISSUE. GOOD YOU MAY CALL THE ROLL ON A. B. NINE A FOR THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE PRIVACY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER. HI JONES I YOUR COMMITTEE THAT'S MY CAN BE REACHED DISHER MAYBE CAN HELP FROM THE CHAIR PERSON YEAH. LACKEY HI LACKEY I OUR CAN BACKING HAD I'D DEEP. DEEP I KAMLAGER KAMLAGER I QUIRK. SANTIAGO SANTIAGO I'D WICKS. THE MEASURE PASSES GREGORY MUCHA MEMBERS GIVE ME ITEM NUMBER TWO A. B. SIX SIX FIVE GALLAGHER PAROLE YOU DEFENDER PAROLE HEARINGS MR GALLAGHER WHENEVER YOU'RE READY I SEE YOU HAVE A. WE HAVE A VISIT FROM THE OTHER HOUSE SENATOR. YES SENATOR NIELSEN IT'S MY JOINT CO AUTHOR OKAY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY THIS MORNING. AND I ALSO WANT TO START BY SAYING I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATIONS THAT YOU AND I HAVE HAD- WITH REGARD TO THIS BILL- IN WITH REGARD TO CRIMINAL JUSTICE- IN GENERAL- I THINK DOES HAVE BEEN VERY POSITIVE. I HAVE APPRECIATED SOME OF THE BACK AND FORTH THAT I'VE HAD WITH MANY OF THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. AND. JUST WANT TO SAY AT THE OUTSET I THINK EVERYBODY INVOLVED- WITH THIS BILL IN THE IN THE ISSUES INVOLVED THERE IN EVERYBODY HAS THE SAME MOTIVE WHICH IS THE PURSUIT OF JUSTICE- IN FACT I THINK WE COULD POTENTIALLY EVEN CHANGE THE NAME OF THIS COMMITTEE TO THE COMMITTEE ON JUSTICE. BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S WHAT EVERYBODY IS FOCUSED ON AND IN IS IN IS SEEKING OUT AND TRYING TO FIND THE RIGHT. THE RIGHT WAY. AND THAT'S PART OF WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY THE. THE INTEREST OF JUSTICE- WERE SHOWN IN THE SUPREME COURT CASE OF MILLER VERSUS ALABAMA. WHEN THE SUPREME COURT HELD THAT IT IS WRONG TO AND JUST TO LOCK UP A JUVENILE OFFENDERS. NO MATTER WHAT HEINOUS THEIR CRIMES MAY BE TO LOCK UP AND THROW AWAY THE KEY AND NOT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHOW REHABILITATION NOT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY- A CHANGE CHARACTER. AND BECAUSE OF THAT SUPREME COURT CASE WE CHANGE LAWS HEE IN CALIFORNIA IN THE INTERESTS OF JUSTICE AND WE DID WE DID PRIMARILY TWO THINGS. I WON SAID THAT THERE SHALL BE. IS FOR JUVENILES WHO WERE SENTENCED TO LIFE WITHOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF PAROLE. THERE SHALL BE S. A HEARING. BEFORE A JUDGE WE CAN SHOW WHERE SOMEONE COULD SHOW THIS IS HOW I HAVE CHANGED THIS IS HOW- MY CHARACTER HAS BEEN IMPROVE THIS IS THE THINGS I'VE BEEN DOING TO GET BETTER THAT I HAVE SHOWN REMORSE. FOR THE CRIME. THAT WAS COMMITTED. WE ALSO PROVIDED. A SECONDARY- REFORM IS AUTOMATIC. PAROLE HEARINGS AFTER TWENTY FIVE YEARS SERVE FOR ALL PEOPLE WHO'D BEEN SENTENCED TO LIFE WITHOUT POSSIBILITY ROLE SO WE DID THOSE TWO THINGS- WHAT MY BILL DOES TODAY. THIS IS CLEAR. IT DOESN'T ROLL BACK ANY OF THOSE THINGS. IT DOESN'T CHANGE THOSE TWO CONCEPTS AND OUR LAW. WHAT IT ACTUALLY DOES IS MERRY THE TWO THINGS TOGETHER. IT MARRIES THOSE TWO CONCEPTS TOGETHER. AND IT ALSO HELPS US ANSWER THE QUESTION OF. THAT IS STILL UNANSWERED. BUYER LAW WHAT ABOUT SOMEONE WHO. WHO IN FACT IS IRREPARABLY CORRUPT WHAT ABOUT SOMEONE WHO IS A SOCIOPATH AND HAS NOT CHANGED AND THAT ALL THE EVIDENCE IN THE FINDING SHOWS HAS NOT CHANGED- I THINK WE ALL. HAVE COMPASSION AND HAVE. AN INTEREST ENSURING THAT THOSE WHO HAVE CHANGE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE REHABILITATED. BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE THEY EXIST. THAT TRULY ARE SOCIOPATHS THAT DON'T SHOW REMORSE. THAT ALL THE EVIDENCE TO PSYCHOLOGISTS WHO EVALUATED- ALL OF THE PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THAT HAVE DETERMINED THAT NO THE INDIVIDUAL IS NOT CAPABLE OF REHABILITATION. AND IN THAT CASE WE DO NEED TO HAVE PROTECTIONS TO ENSURE THAT THEY DON'T GET THE BENEFIT OF AUTOMATIC PAROLE AFTER TWENTY FIVE YEARS. AND SO THAT'S WHAT ERIC'S LAW. DOES. AND IT'S IN MEMORY OF ERIC INGER BREAST IN HEN WHO YOU WILL HEAR ABOUT- YOU KNOW WHO WAS MURDERED IN A VERY HEINOUS WAY. AND THERE WERE TWO MURDERS. CASE ONE WHO HAS SHOWN REMORSE AND IS IN THE PROCESS OF PAROLE AND ONE WHO HAS BEEN FOUND BY A COURT AFTER TWENTY YEARS NOT RIGHT WHEN HE WAS SENTENCED. BUT NOW TOWARD YOUR WHO HAS BEEN FOUND TO BE IRREPARABLY CORRUPT AND YET HE WILL CONTINUE TO GET INDEFINITELY AROLE HEARING STARTING NEXT YEAR. IF WE DON'T MARRY THESE CONCEPTS TOGETHER IN THE PURSUIT OF JUSTICE. AND THAT'S WHAT I SUBMIT TO THIS THIS COMMITTEE TODAY AS I SUBMIT MYSELF I SUBMIT THIS BILL. UNDER THIS COMMITTEE IN THE INTEREST OF JUSTICE- TO MARRY THESE CONCEPTS TOGETHER TO SO THAT WE CAN BETTER GET OUT ALL OF THESE THINGS. AND ENSURE THAT JUSTICE IS TRULY SERVED. AND SATURDAY I HAVE WITH ME MY JOINT AUTHORS SENATOR JIM NIELSEN AS WELL AS TWO WITNESSES. ERIC SISTER DEVON THE MARTY. AND BRENT AND FERAL FROM THE COLUSA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. YES MR BUT I WILL BE VERY BRIEF BUT I COME FROM THIS- FOR WITH THE RATHER SIGNIFICANT AND UNIQUE. PERSPECTIVE MANY YEARS I WAS CHAIRMAN THE CALIFORNIA BOARD OF PAROLE HEARINGS. AND I HAVE PROBABLY READ MORE CASES THAN NOT TOO MANY OTHER PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA EVERY TIME TO FIRST TIME PAROLE VIOLATORS OF DEATH ROW INMATES SEEKING. TIMES IN IT TRULY IS ABOUT JUSTICE BUT JUSTICE. IT'S NOT ONLY FOR THE ACCUSED AND CONVICTED. THE JUSTICES ALSO FOR THE VICTIMS VICTIMS NEXT CAN AND INDEED FOR SOCIETY. OFTEN SAY AS FAR AS VICTIMS ARE CONCERNED. OF AGREE JUST CRIMES VICTIM NEXT OF KIN. THERE'S NO CLOSURE. THERE'S NO GETTING OVER IT. EVERY HOLIDAY. EVERY BIRTHDAY. EVERYDAY THEY REVISIT THEIR SENTENCE OF GRIEF FOR THE LOSS FOR. IN THIS LEGISLATION I THINK BRINGS THE EQUITY AND THE RESPECT TO THAT ISSUE OF JUSTICE. FOR SOCIETY. THAT FOR VICTIMS. THESE PARTICULAR KINDS OF CRIMES WITH SEVERAL FOR SIMILAR FACTUAL. CIRCUMSTANCES ARE STILL OCCURRING. WE JUST HAD ONE IN WEST SACRAMENTO I DON'T REPRESENT THAT NOW THAT I USED TO. I AM VERY FAMILIAR THE CASE. AND THE GRANDFATHER OF THE VICTIM. CALLED ME. TALKED ABOUT HIS GRANDDAUGHTER AND HER CIRCUMSTANCES. HE WHEN HIS HEART AND HIS GRIEF WAS CALLING OUT FOR JUSTICE. AND I ENTREAT THE COMMITTEE TO FAVOR BUT CONSIDER THIS BILL IN THE FURTHERANCE OF JUSTICE. THANK THANK YOU SIR YES YES. TOTAL FIVE MINUTES OF WHERE YOU WANT TO BREAK IT UP. EVERYONE HERE FOR BOTH OF YOU SO SURE PLEASE PLEASE GOOD MORNING- CURRENTLY ELEVEN SEVENTY DUE TO PROVIDES FOR RE SENTENCING HEARINGS TO JUVENILE L. WHAT MURDER CONVICTS. EACH OF THESE HEARINGS ARE TIME CONSUMING LABOR AND GIVE INVOLVED SECURITY ISSUES AND ARCHER MATIC FOR VICTIMS IN THE COMMUNITY. EACH HEARING ALSO HAS A RIGHT TO APPEAL. INCLUDES THE COUNTY WE SPENT FOUR DAYS IN ELEVEN SEVENTY DUE TO HEARING. THE PREPARATION COVER THE UNDERLYING CASE AS WELL AS THE INMATES ENTIRE SEE FILE. THE JUDGE'S DECISION HAS SINCE BEEN APPEALED AND WE HAVE MULTIPLE HEARINGS AND APPEALS AHEAD. ALL THIS THIS PASSAGE OF SB THREE NINETY FOUR WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO REMEDY THESE EXPENSIVE TIME CONSUMING HEARINGS AND APPEALS. SB THREE NINETY FOUR DOES NOT FIX THE SITUATION IT ONLY ADDS INSULT TO INJURY BY PROVIDING PAROLE HEARINGS FROM THE TWENTY FOURTH YEAR OF INCARCERATION. ONWARD WITH NO GUIDANCE ON HOW MANY PAROLE HEARINGS WILL BE PROVIDED OR HOW FREQUENTLY. VICTIMS AN AGENT TO UNDERGO FOR HEARINGS UNDER ELEVEN SEVENTY TWO AND TEN DOZENS OF PAROLE HEARINGS GOING FORWARD. IF THE LEAD JUST CONCERNED ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT ONLY THE WORST OFFENDERS WERE SENSE TO L. WHAT THEY WOULD PROVIDE ALL INMATES WITH THE RE SENSING HEARING TO ENSURE THE UNCONSTITUTIONAL SENSES RECTIFIED. THIS BILL DOES THAT. SB THREE NINETY FOUR ELEVEN SEVENTY DO NOT. IF THE LEGISLATURE WERE CONCERNED ABOUT PUBLIC SAFETY IN VICTIMS RIGHTS IT WOULD MINIMIZE HEARINGS IN GENERAL PER PERSON SO DANGEROUS THEY WERE FOUND TO BE INCAPABLE OF REHABILITATION. THERE'S A LITTLE BENEFITS AND GREAT HARM IN HOLDING DOZENS OF HEARINGS FOR THE RARE JUVENILE OFFENDER THAT SHOULD NEVER BE RELEASED. THIS ACCOUNTS FOR THAT SB THREE NINETY FOUR AND ELEVEN SEVENTY DO NOT. THIS BILL IS BALLOT IT PROVIDES FOR JUST SENTENCING FOR ALL JUVENILE UPS. N. MAINTAINS MINIMAL HEARINGS FOR THE TRULY DANGEROUS. SB THREE NINETY FOUR WAS A CHEAP FIX FOR MILLER AND MONTGOMERY. AB SIX SIX FIVE IS THE PROPER FIX. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. IT GOOD MORNING LET ME BE CLEAR WE BELIEVE IN SECOND CHANCES WHEN DESERVED ONE OF MY BROTHER'S MURDERS LEO CAN SURE AS WAS GRANTED PAROLE IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND IT'S A DECISION WE ARE AT PEACE WITH LEO ALWAYS MAINTAINED HIS REMORSE FOR HIS PART. ORDER THE SAME CANNOT BE SAID ANYTHING RAMOS ZENI WHO AT SIXTEEN PLANNED EXECUTED AND ATTEMPTED TO COVER UP WHAT DID TO ERIC. FOUR BLOWS IN FATAL STAB WOUNDS INCLUDING A SLIP WROTE. BUT NOW NATHAN'S LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE SENTENCE IS CEASING TO HOLD MERIT SIMPLY BECAUSE OF AGE HE WAS GIVEN A RE SENSING HEARING IN OCTOBER TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WHERE WE LISTEN TO HIM TESTIFY THAT KILLING ERIC MADE HIM FEEL POWERFUL. THE JUDGE APPLIED THE ADOLESCENT FACTORS OF TRANSIENT RASHNESS PROCLIVITY FOR RISK IN ABILITY TO ASSESS CONSEQUENCES AND WHETHER THERE WAS EVIDENCE OF A DIFFICULT UPBRINGING WITH EXPOSURE TO VIOLENCE OR ABUSE. HE FOUNDED NONE OF THESE TRUE FOR NATHAN. HE CONSIDERED NATHAN'S PRISON RECORD WHICH IS RIDDLED VIOLENCE. HE CAN STE HE STATED THAT NAY AND STILL SHOWED NO REMORSE AND DAMAGE. SHIN WAS POSSIBLE JUDGE LIKE ALL I AM FOUNDATION TO BE IRREPARABLY CORRUPT UP HELD HIS SENTENCE THE SUPREME COURT RULED THAT THE LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE SENTENCE MUST BE RESERVED FOR THE RAREST JUVENILE OFFENDER WHOSE CRIME REFLECTS PERMANENT IN COURT THE LADY THIS RULING ACKNOWLEDGE THAT TYPE OF JUVENILE HOWEVER RARE DOES EXIST.

AS A CERTIFIED DRUG AND ALCOHOL COUNSELOR I AM THE CO FOUNDER OF A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION REVOLUTION GROUP WHICH HAS STATE AND LOCAL CONTRACTS. TO WORK WITH TROUBLED YOUTH IN JUVENILE AND ADULT INSTITUTIONS. I HAVE BEEN APPOINTED AS A COMMISSIONER SAN MATTEO COUNTIES JUVENILE JUSTICE DELINQUENCY PREVENTION COMMISSION. I AM PROUD OF THE WORK I DO TO MAKE SOCIETY BETTER AND REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD OF FUTURE CRIMES AND YOU VICTIMS. FOR I AM NOT PROUD OF EVERY ONE OF MY LIFE BILL. I HAD A TROUBLE FILL CHILDHOOD. WITH AN ADDRESS OF YOUR ABUSE AND NEGLECT. BY THE TIME I WAS A TEENAGER I WAS FILLED WITH PAIN AND ANGER. MISGUIDED GANGS ULTIMATELY ON BEHALF OF THE GANG PLAYED A ROLE IN A DRIVE BY SHOOTING OF ANOTHER TRUCK. TROUBLED YOUTH. AT THE TIME I WAS BIRD MY OWN PAIN AND HAD NO REAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE HARM I HAD CAUSED. MANY YEARS LATER AND UNDERSTAND IT. AND OUR LIVE EACH DAY WITH REMORSE FOR MY ACTIONS. I WAS CONDEMNED TO LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE. THE SENTENCE VALIDATED WHAT I THOUGHT OF MYSELF. THAT NO ONE THOUGHT I COULD EVER BE A GOOD PERSON. IN PRISON I WAS A- AND ENTERED MY WHOLE LIFE. ASSAULT RAPE AND MORE. I FOUND MYSELF RIGHT BACK WHERE I WAS AS A KID FULL OF FEAR. I DID WOULD HELP SURVIVE IN THE PAST AND I JOINED A GANG. AT THE AGE OF TWENTY TWO I WAS SENT TO PELICAN BAY STATE PRISON AND PUT IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT. I WAS A SOLID TO KERR IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT FOR MORE THAN TEN YEARS. IF YOU HAD MADE ME DURING THAT TIME. MAYBE YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE WAS THE RIGHT SENDS FOR ME. BUT INSTEAD LEGISLATURE PASSED SB NINE IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE. A LAW THEY GAVE SECOND CHANCES TO YOUTH LIKE MYSELF. THAT LAW GAVE ME HOPE AND LET ME KNOW THAT YOU BELIEVE THAT I COULD CHANGE. I CAN OF HOW MUCH THAT HOPE AND YOUR BELIEF IN READ CHANGE THINGS. I WORK FOR YEARS TO DRAMATICALLY CHANGED MY LIFE AND BECOME THE PERSON I BELIEVE I WAS MEANT TO BE. AND BECAUSE OF SB NINE. AND BY THE GRACE OF GOD I WAS PAROLED. TODAY I SAW ON TO HOPE. THE HOPE THAT WE WILL NOT MOVE BACKWARDS AS THE STATE AND BEGIN THE INHUMANE PRACTICE OF CONDEMNING YOUTH TO LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE. ASSEMBLY BILL SIX SIX FIVE WOULD DO JUST THAT. IT ELIMINATES THE AND IT SENDS A MESSAGE THAT WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT OUR YOUTH CAN GROW AND CHANGE I RESPECTFULLY URGE NO VOTE. THANK YOU. TAKE YOUR CHAIRPERSON COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS JOSHUA GUNTER JOHNSON I'M THE SURVIVOR OF ATTEMPTED MURDER. I WOKE IN THE MIDDLE RIGHT AND- DISCOVER TWO PEOPLE BROKEN INTO MY HOME WHEN WITHOUT A WORD ONE OF THEM POINTED A PISTOL OUT ME AND SHOT ME TWICE- BUT I THE FORTUNE WENT MY GOOD FRIEND PATCH CLIENT WAS SHOT. MURDER AND ATTEMPTED MURDER AND GIVEN LIFE WITHOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF PAROLE. TWENTY FIVE YEARS LTER I STILL HAVE A THIRTY TWO CALIBER BULLET REMAINS LODGED IN MY NECK BETWEEN C. THREE AND FORMER MY SERVER CERVICAL VERTEBRAE SO. MANY INJURIES WERE SEVERE BUT MY PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT OF THE CRIME IN YOUR LONG AFTER I HEALED PHYSICALLY. THE TRAUMA PROPELLED ME IN A DOWNWARD SPIRAL I BECAME ADDICTED TO OPIATES- WHICH BY WAS EXPOSED TO THE FIRST TIME WHILE RECOVERING FROM A GUNSHOT WOUNDS. THOUGH MY USER VOTE WAS INITIALLY FROM MY PHYSICAL INJURIES I EVENTUALLY BEGAN TO RELY ON THEM TO MEDICATE MY PSYCHOLOGICAL INJURIES. I LIVE WITH SURVIVORS GUILT AND UNTREATED PTSD THAT I'M- MAPS WITH THE USE OF DRUGS UNTIL I MADE A DECISION TO GET SOBER FOURTEEN YEARS AGO. WITHOUT PAIN MEDICATION I WAS FORCED TO ADDRESSING. THE ANGER I KERRY TOWARDS INDIVIDUALS WOULD HARM ME. FOR MY OWN BENEFIT I DECIDED TO REACH OUT TO BOTH OF THEM. AND WROTE LETTERS TO INQUIRE ABOUT DURING OUR SEPARATION AND WHAT THEY'VE DONE WITH THEIR LIFE. ASIAN SHOT RESPONDED IN A THIRTY PAGE APPALL. GIVE ME SOME INSIGHT INTO HIS CHILDHOOD TRAUMA DEEPER MORE SINCE STEP TO TAKEN TO TURN HIS LIFE AROUND WHILE INCARCERATED I COULD SEE WAS A CHANGED PERSON. NOT SUGGESTING THAT EVERYONE CHANGES WHAT I'M SAYING IS HOWEVER IS THAT DURING MY OWN PROCESS OF GROWTH I'VE LEARNED IMPORTANT TRUTH YOUNG PEOPLE WHO CAUSE TREMENDOUS HARM CAN BE HEALTHY ADULTS AND HAVE A LOT TO OFFER SOCIETY. THIS LED TO ME TO A CONCLUSION THAT SENSE WITH LIFE WITHOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF PAROLE PAROLE IS WRONG BECAUSE IT IGNORES THE POTENTIAL FOR CHANGE. I WILL KICK THINGS EXISTING LAW IS THE RIGHT APPROACH WHEN YOUNG OFFENDERS. IT GIVES A SECOND CHANCE TO YOU SENT LIFE WITH THE WITHOUT PAROLE THE CURRENT LAW MANDATES A LONG TIME PERIOD FOR CHANGE TWENTY FIVE YEARS BEFORE THE FIRST BILL. OR DID YOU JUST WANT TO ZERO FOR. THE POOR MEMBERS ARE EXPERTS IN MAKE. AN INDIVIDUAL MUST SHOW THAT THEY HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT COURSE CORRECTIONS IN THEIR LIFE OR THE BOARD NOT GVE THEM CONSIDERATION. CHRISTIAN THE PERSON THAT HARM ME IN MY CRIME WAS NINETEEN AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT AND HE DID NOT BENEFIT FROM SB THREE NINETY FOUR BUT DUE TO HIS TREMENDOUS CHANGE IN THE WORK YOU DID WHILE THE CARS RATED.

THEY WILL BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. LIST QUIRK. YES QUESTION TO THE CHAIR. AS I UNDERSTAND THE BELL- THE COULD CONCERN IS FAMILIES HAVING TO GO BACK REPEATEDLY- TO. NOT TO TESTIFY ON AT PAROLE HEARINGS I DO HAVE THAT CORRECTED AND MISTER GALLAGHER. SO PERHAPS YOU COULD ADDRESS THAT ISSUE IN TERMS OF. IF SOMEONE HAS COMMITTED A TRULY HEINOUS CRIME AND SHOWS NO SIGNS OF REDEMPTION HOW LIKELY IS IT THAT THE FAMILY IS GOING TO HAVE TO GO BACK EVERY EIGHTEEN MONTHS TO THREE YEARS COULD YOU ADDRESS THAT MR CHARM. ACTUALLY I DON'T. TO DON'T KNOW I THINK IT'S UP TO THE FAMILY MEMBERS WHETHER OR NOT THEY WANT TO COME BACK EACH TIME NO INTEREST IN IS- WHAT IS THE REQUIREMENT- OF THE PAROLE BOARD AND PERHAPS YOU CUT. I DON SO THAT CRAFT GO I'M MY PROJECT CONDUCTS PRO HEARINGS ON BEHALF OF LIFE PRESENTED AN IDEA THAT PRO CLIENTS AND HAS DONE SO FOR MANY YEARS. UNDER MARCY'S LAW. THE TYPE OF PERSON YOU'RE DESCRIBING HAS DISCRETION TO SET THEM OFF FOR A NEW PRO HEARING FOR UP TO FIFTEEN YEARS AND VERY OFTEN IT PRO PROCESS WHEN WE SEE SOMEONE. WHO DOESN'T SHOW REMORSE HASN'T CHANGED CONTINUES PILOT. I'M THERE'S THAT OVER IS TEN OR OR EVEN FIFTEEN YEARS SO THE FAMILY WOULD BE COMING BACK EVERY EIGHTEEN MONTHS TO HAVE TO. AND GIVEN THAT- I WILL UNFORTUNATELY MISTER GALLAGHER NOT BE ABLE TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY COULD I IT TO THE CHAIR COULD I HAVE ONE OF MY WITNESSES MAYBE RESPONSE AND AS TO WHAT HAPPENED WITH PRO HEARINGS BECAUSE I HAVE PEOPLE WHO HAVE EXPERTISE IN THE CITY. AS WELL CAN HELP IT MR. QUESTION DEFINITELY WILL TAKE. SO IT. YEAH WELL YOU SAID SO WE'RE TALKING ANOTHER ATTORNEY OR SOMEONE IF YOU'RE TALKING PERSONAL FAMILY THAT'S ONE THING BUT YOU WERE THIS IS A TECHNICAL QUESTION ABOUT HOW MR QUIRKS CONCERN IS THAT YOU ARE BURDENED THE FAMILY MEMBERS A BIRD COMING BACK EVERY EIGHTEEN. OKAY OR THAT. YOU COMING BACK EVERY EIGHTEEN MONTHS OR- SIX MONTHS FOR PAROLE HEARING AND ACCORDING THIS WITNESS IS NOT AS FREQUENT IS THAT SO WHAT I WANT FOR SOMEONE WHO WHO THIS FAMILY MEMBER DESCRIBED AS- DEMONSTRATING REMORSE IRREPARABLY CORRUPT CONTINUING TO COMMIT VIOLENCE DO YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT. UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROCEDURE FOR VOTE AND WANT FIRST OF ALL WHAT YOU HEARD THE WITNESS SAY IS THEY HAVE AUTHORITY TO DELAY IT UP TO FIFTEEN YEARS RIGHT. WHAT I'VE HEARD FROM COUNTLESS VICTIMS GROUPS. ISTHAT THESE HAPPEN EITHER EIGHTEEN MONTHS TO THREE YEARS CONTINUOUSLY INDEFINITELY. AND WHAT MY BILL IS SEEKING TO. DO IS SAY IF THERE HAS BEEN A DETERMINATION. THAT THE PERSON IS A RAPPER ABILITY CORRUPT THIS IS YEARS AFTER THEY'VE COMMITTED DEFENSIVE TWENTY YEARS OR MORE. IF THAT DETERMINATION IS BEEN MADE THEN THERE AREN'T THESE AUTOMATIC REPEATED PAROLE HEARINGS THERE'S STILL THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHOW ALL THE THINGS. YOU KNOW THAT THE OPPOSITION IS TALKING ABOUT THAT THERE HAS BEEN CHANGES THAT THEY CAN CONSIDER ALL THOSE FACTORS- AND SO THAT THEY WOULD GET ELIGIBLE FOR PAROLE AND ULTIMATELY RELEASE. AND AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE COUNTLESS ABOUT A WITNESSES HAVE COME UP HERE THE POLICY IS IN FACT DOING THAT MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN RELEASED BECAUSE THEY'RE SHOWING THOSE THING. WE'RE TRYING TO DEAL WITH A VERY LIMITED GROUP OF PEOPLE OUT THERE. WHO THE PSYCHOLOGISTS AND- ALL THE EXPERTS HAVE ASSASSIN SAID THEY'RE NOT. CABLE REHABILITATION THERE A SOCIOPATH. AND SO THEY SHOULD NOT BE AUTOMATICALLY GIVEN A PAROLE HEARING BUT UNDER CURRENT LAW THEY WILL. MAYBE THEY'LL DO FIFTEEN YEARS BUT MAYBE THE FAMILY WILL BE EVERY THREE YEARS BROUGHT INTO A PAROLE HEARING. BEGGING AND PLEADING PLEASE DON'T RELEASES PERSON SO TO DISCRETION IS TOTALLY UP TO THE JUDGE. TO THE PAROLE BOARD WROBEL IN THAT CASE. HEY UP TO THE OPPOSITE END UP HAVE YOU SEEN THIS HAPPENED THAT- FAMILIES ARE. WELL THIS IS A CLEARLY A- RARE CASE I WOULD THANK- HAVE YOU SEEN IN OUR PAROLE BOARDS ASKING PEOPLE TO COME BACK EVERY EIGHTEEN MONTHS TO THREE YEARS IN THIS SORT OF CASE NOT FOR PEOPLE WHO DOT FOR THE RECORD GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT THAT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY A REFERRING TO WHERE THERE'S BEEN A FINDING OF HIGH RISK OF. LIKE OF RECIDIVISM PSYCHOPATHY YOUR SKILL WERE RECESS AT OR CONTINUED BUT PRISON NOT FOR THOSE NOT FOR THOSE PEOPLE. IT'S TRUE THAT AT THE PROBOARDS LAW REQUIRES THAT OVER TO ME. MUCH LONG WILL TAKE ONE TO MEET THEIR VERY HIGH STANDARD. NOT POSING ANY DANGER TO THE COMMUNITY SO PEOPLE WHO ARE ARE CLOSE TO MEETING THAT STANDARD WHO ARE BY DEFINITION NOT A REP OF THE CORRUPT MAY RETURN TO THE PAROLE BOARD WITHIN EIGHTEEN MONTHS OR THREE YEARS- BUT BUT THAT'S NOT THOSE ARE. THE PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE GROUP OF PEOPLE WERE CONCERNED ABOUT- AND THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY HAS BEEN REFERRING TO. THANK YOU WE ALSO HAVE A RECORD OF WE ALSO HAVE THE BENEFIT OF THE FORMER. MEMBER OF THE BOARD A PRESENTER IS RIGHT HERE WITH US. THE SENATOR- BUT MISSED CUT BY THE DOG IN THE HOUSE. SO HE HAS A LITTLE BIT OF EXPERIENCE ON THE ISSUE AS WELL. THANK YOU. THIS COUPLE HUNDRED OF THANK YOU I AM. A HAPPY NEW YEAR AND HAPPY BIRTHDAY- I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS THROUGH THE CHAIR- THE FIRST QUESTION IS- YOU KNOW WHO DETERMINES. IN THIS SCENARIO IF SOMEONE IS. ARAB LEAGUE CORRUPT AND HOW CAN THAT BE OBJECTIVELY DETERMINED WITHIN A SYSTEM LIKE OUR PRISON SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE ALREADY IDENTIFIED AS BEING A SYSTEM- RIFE WITH CHALLENGES AND FRAUGHT WITH SOME FAILURES SO THAT'S MY ONE QUESTION- AND I ASK IT BECAUSE I ACTUALLY YOU KNOW PASSED THE BILL TWO FOUR TWO THAT IS WITH BIAS IN THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM- AND SO HOW IS THAT TAKEN OUT. AND THEN THE SECOND QUESTION IS- AS IT RELATES TO THE HEARINGS MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT YOU KNOW IF THE POSSIBILITY OF PAROLE IT'S NOT GUARANTEED PAROLE AND SO THE POSSIBLE. ROLLING GOING BEFORE A PANEL FOR A HEARING IS ABOUT TO PROCESS THE NIPPLE TAKING THIS A WHERE WE IN FACT TAKING AWAY- A PERSON'S ABILITY TO DUE PROCESS SO THOSE ARE MY TWO QUESTIONS THE OBJECTIVITY OF THE DEFINITION AND FOR MY- PROCESS. IN THIS MAY BE. BUT IT'S ALSO HAD EXPERIENCE BEAT ON IT MIGHT HELPFUL ALSO SO HOW DO YOU WANT TO PARSE OUT THOSE TWO QUESTIONS- OF WELL ALL ALL STARTED IN A CAN THAT MY WITNESS TESTIFIES TO WHATEVER DO YOU WANT HE WOULD LIKE SENATOR WHO'S BEEN ON A PAROLE BOARD THAT MIGHT HAVE SOME EXPERIENCE ABOUT. HOW OFTEN IT IS. TYPICALLY THESE HEINOUS INDIVIDUALS LET ME LET ME START WITH HER QUESTION WHICH IS- WHO DETERMINES IT IT'S A JUDGE THAT DETERMINES IT THAT'S HOW IT IS RIGHT NOW. AT STATUS QUO. THERE ARE RE SENTENCING HEARINGS THAT ARE GRANTED TO EVERY JUVENILE OFFENDER WHO IS WHO HAS BEEN SENTENCED TO L. WHAT. AND WE AGREE WITH THAT POLICY WE'RE NOT DISAGREEING WITH THAT AT ALL IN FACT IT WAS GOOD TO HEAR A LOT OF THE OPPOSITION BECAUSE WE REALLY DON'T DISAGREE. THIS GENTLEMAN STORY IS AMAZING AND IT'S IT IS THE FRUIT OF THAT POLICY READ A PERSON WHO HAS CHANGED HIS. AND HIS CHANGE AND AS RECOGNIZE WHAT THEY DID AND SHOWS REMORSE GETS THE OPPORTUNITY TO PAROLE AND BE RELEASED RIGHT. BUT WHO MAKES THAT DETERMINATION IS THE JUDGE AND ARE I MEAN READING FROM MY BILL. THEY LOOK AT THE DEFENDANT'S FAMILY AND HOME ENVIRONMENT INCLUDING CHILDHOOD ABUSE OR NEGLECT FAMILIAL DRUG USE OR ALCOHOL ABUSE. THEY LOOK AT THE CIRCUMSTANCES THE AFFECT THE EXTENT OF THE DEFENDANTS PARTICIPATION. AND THE WAY FAMILIAR OR PEER PRESSURES. THAT YOU KNOW IN THE CASE OF A GANG MIGHT HAVE PLAYED AND PLAYED PLAYED A ROLE IN THAT. THEY LOOK AT YOU KNOW THE AGE OF THE PERSON IN THE THIS. YOU KNOW HOW IMMATURITY YEAR IN AND- PATCH YOU ARE CITY AND FAILURE TO APPRECIATE RISKING CONSEQUENCES. PSYCHOLOGY INVOLVED IN THAT PROCESS I DON'T TAKE AWAY ANY OF THAT. ALL THAT HAPPENS IN A JUDGE MAKES A DETERMINATION BASED ON ALL THAT EVIDENCE IF THE PERSON IS IRREPARABLY CORRUPTOR NOT. NOT AT THE TIME THEY WERE SENDS LIKE YEARS AFTER SO WE'RE LOOKING AT THE WHOLE PERIOD OF TIME. DEVON'S FAMILY JUST WENT THROUGH ONE OF THOSE RE SENTENCING HEARING. THE DEFENDANT WAS FOUND AFTER CONSIDERING ALL OF THAT TO BE IRREPARABLY CORRUPT. SO WE'RE JUST ST IN THAT CASE. DON'T GIVE GUARANTEED PAROLE HEARINGS IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE GETTING NOW I AGREE WITH YOU BUT DON'T GIVE GUARANTEED PRO HEARINGS AGO INDEFINITELY AND COULD BE EVERY THREE YEARS. THAT HER FAMILY GETS DRAGGED BACK INTO THAT TO HAVE TO COME AND TESTIFY AND TALK AND BE DRAGGED THROUGH THE CRIME ALL OVER AGAIN. WHEN THERE'S ALREADY TERMINATION THAT HAD A WHOLE LOT OF STUFF THAT WENT INTO IT. THAT'S OUR ASKING FOR NOT TAKING AWAY THAT UNDERLYING POLICY WHICH I THINK WE ALL AGREE WITH. WHICH IS THAT PEOPLE DO DO THINGS WHEN THEY'RE YOUNG. THEY'RE BAD JUDGMENTS THAT ARE THINGS THAT HAPPEN. THE OTHER MURDER IN THIS CASE IS ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE. HE GOT DRAGGED ALONG FOR THE RIDE. AND HE IS BEING PAROLED AND HE'S SHOWN REMORSE AND HE'S GET. THE FAMILY. IS SUPPORT OF AN ACCEPTED ACCEPTING OF THAT OKAY MISSED CODE SO THAT'S I MEAN I'M JUST THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND I THINK A LOT OF THINGS GET CONVOLUTED OUR POLITICS THESE DAYS ARE SUCH THAT WE WANT TO GET ON OUR RESPECTIVE SIDES IN. AND CALL THE OTHER ONE DOING THIS BUT LET'S LOOK AT WHAT IT REALLY DOES IS MY POINT. AND I THINK IT'S A REASONABLE REFORM THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT THE POLICY THAT EVERYBODY IN HERE SAID THEY SUPPORT. DID YOU DID YOU WANT TO ADD JUST- TO YOUR QUESTION THAT THE JUDGE THE CALL MILLER FINDINGS ANY APPLIED EVERYTHING TO NATHAN AND TAKE EVERYTHING INTO CONSIDERATION ANYTHING SAT UP THERE AND SAID HE ENJOYED THE WAY IT SOUNDED LISTENING TO MY BROTHER'S BONES CRACKED WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A VERY DIFFERENT TYPE OF CRIMINAL HERE- AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO THROUGH THREE MORE RECENT SING HEARINGS AS THE LAW STATES RIGHT NOW. WHEN JUDGES AND APPELLATE JUDGES OF ALREADY DETERMINED HIM TO BE IRREPARABLY CORRUPT SO ON TOP OF THOSE THREE RE SENTENCING HEARINGS WE ALSO HAVE THE INDEFINITE PAROLE BOARD HEARINGS IT IS NEVER ENDS WERE ASKING FOR A COMPROMISE HOW CAN WE LIMIT THESE. FOR THE USE. THESE RARE JUVENILE OFFENDERS NOT THE PEOPLE WHO WERE HERE TODAY WE BELIEVE IN SECOND CHANCES BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE ARE THOSE WHO WILL NEVER SHOW REMORSE THEY'RE INCAPABLE OF IT PSYCHOLOGICALLY. AND THEY ARE A CONTINUED THREAT THAT'S ALL ERIC'S LIES TRYING TO ADDRESS. THANK YOU. UNDER THIS LAW MISTER BOCANEGRAWOULD ALMOST CERTAINLY ASK THE QUESTION BECAUSE I'M JUST SO I MEAN I JUST WANNA MAKE NOTE RELIEF ON YOUR RIGHT. DOZENS OF THE BANKS NEXT- UNDER THIS LAW MISTER BOCANEGRA ALMOST CERTAINLY WOULD DIE IN PRISON THIS LAW. REQUIRES THE DETERMINATION BY THE JUDGE FOR EVERY JUVENILE SINCE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE TO BE MADE AT THE OUTSET TO BE MADE AT THE TIME OF THE CRIME WHEN EVEN MILLER THE UNITED THAT THE SUPREME COURT A MILLER SAYS. ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE THAT DETERMINATION AT THE OUTSET- AND IN MOST ALMOST CERTAINLY HE WOULD HAVE BEEN. FOUND TO BE A REPLICA BECAUSE WHAT HOW DO WE KNOW WHAT SOMEONE'S GOING TO LOOK LIKE WHEN THEY'RE TWENTY FIVE OR THIRTY OR THIRTY FIVE THAT IS THE TEACHING. OF THE SUPREME COURT CASES AND THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT CASES AND. WHAT CURRENT LAW DOES IS ALLOW SOMEONE THE POSSIBILITY TO GROW AND CHANGE AND BE INCENTIVIZE TO CHANGE AND THEN KEEP PUTS. THE DETERMINATION OF IRREPARABLE CORRUPTION MEANS THE CURRENT DANGERS IN DAYS GONE LEGAL STANDARD BUT IT'S A REBEL CORRUPTION NO ONE WHO IS A RAPPER THE CORRUPT. IS RELEASED FROM A CALIFORNIA PRISON THROUGH OUR PAROLE PROCESS IT PUTS THAT DETERMINATION IN THE HANDS OF EXPERTS WHO SPEND HOURS. QUESTIONING THE PERSON SEEKING PAROLE EVALUATING PSYCHOLOGICAL RECORDS FROM THE TIME THEY WERE JUVENILES AND CURRENT PSYCHOLOGICAL- DETERMINATIONS MADE BY THE PORTABLE WHO HAVE EXPERIENCE IN CORRECTIONS EXPERIENCE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT TO MAKE THAT DETERMINATION. THE REST THE RECIDIVISM RATE THE VIOLENT RECIDIVISM RATE FOR PEOPLE RELEASE WERE CALIFORNIA PRO PROCESS IS AROUND ONE PERCENT. SO WE'RE GETTING IT RIGHT. THAT THAT THAT THAT THE PEOPLE THAT THE MAN WHO TOOK HER BROTHER'S LIFE AND THAT TE RARE IF THERE'S THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ARE NOT. RETURNING TO OUR SOCIETY THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA PROPOSES AND I DON'T BELIEVE THEY EVER WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT. THE THAT COME CLOSE THEY ANSWERING YOUR FIRST QUESTION. YES THAT- DID YOU WATER PITCHER SECOND SO WE GET WHILE THE SECOND QUESTION MISTER CHAIR HAD TO DO WITH DUE PROCESS AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THEY HEARINGS ARE A FORM OF DUE PROCESS AND SO TAKING THAT AWAY ALSO IMPACTS ABILITY TO HAVE SUCH A SOMEONE'S ABILITY TO HAVE DUE PROCESS I ALSO WANT TO- TO SHARE SINCE WE- ABOUT MILLER V. ALABAMA THAT EVEN SCALIA OPINED IN THAT. RULING THAT FOR JUVENILE REHABILITATION AS A PRIORITY OVER PUNISHMENT BUT MY SECOND QUESTION HAD TO DO WITH DUE PROCESS AND IF THIS IS WOULD BE COMPROMISING THAT. SO I AGREE WITH WHAT- THE WITNESS JUST SAID EXCEPT FOR THE WHAT SHE SAID ABOUT MY BILL IS FALSE AND I'LL JUST READ FROM THE BILL AGAIN. THE COURT SHALL PROVIDE A DEFENDANT WHO IS UNDER EIGHTEEN YEARS OF AGE AT THE TIME OF THE COMMISSION OF THE OFFENSE FOR WHICH THE DEFENDANT WAS SENTENCED TO LIFE WITHOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF PAROLE. WITH A RE SENTENCING HEARING ACCORDING TO THE TERMS OF THIS PARAGRAPH AND THE TERMS OF WHAT I READ TO YOU EARLIER ABOUT ALL THOSE THINGS THEY GET CONSIDERED. SO SAYING THAT MY BILL CLOSES OFF THIS GENTLEMAN'S OPPORTUNITY REDEMPTION IS 1100% FALSE. AND IT'S NOT WHAT THIS BILL DOES AND I'M TIRED OF PEOPLE. NOT TELLING THE TRUTH ABOUT THE LANGUAGE OF THE BILL AND WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING I JUST I MEAN I GET PASSION ABOUT BECAUSE YOU BELIEVE IN REHABILITATION AND WE SUPPORT THAT. WE'RE SAYING THAT. IF AT THAT RE SENSING HEARING WHERE THERE IS DUE PROCESS ALL THESE HEARINGS ARE DUE PROCESS IS THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY LOOK. I HAVE CHANGED. HERE'S WHAT I'VE BEEN DOING HERE'S AND DO AND AN OPPORTUNITY SHOW REMORSE ABOUT THE CRIME. AS ONE OF THE MURDERS IN THIS CASE AND I DON'T WANT TO USE THIS CASE IS THE ONLY ONE BECAUSE THERE'S- MANY DIFFERENT SITUATIONS OUT THERE. HE DID AND ALL THE INDIVIDUALS WHO CAME UP HERE. AND TESTIFIED THEY HAVE THIS ABILITY TO MAKE THAT SHOWING INTO GET ULTIMATELY RELEASE. ONLY IN THE CASE OF THE LAW. THERE WAS DEVON SAID THE LIMITED JUVENILE OFFENDER. WHERE THEY FIND LOOK THERE'S NO REMORSE HERE THIS PERSON IS A SOCIOPATH. THEY'RE NOT CABLE REHABILITATION THEN THERE WOULD BE NO PAROLE HEARING AIDS THANK YOU MISS AGO EARLY ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. IT YOU MAY CLOSE HARD WAS THAT YOUR CLOTHES. WELL I'M MISTER CHAIRMAN I APPRECIATE YOUR INDULGENCE. AS YOU KNOW I BELIEVE VERY STRONGLY IN THIS IN THIS BILL. AND AGAIN I WOULD JUST I WOULD REITERATE THAT I DON'T REALLY THINK THAT OPPOSITION AND MYSELF ARE REALLY IN DISAGREEMENT IF WE LOOK AT WHAT THIS ILL ACTUALLY DOES AND I'VE SAID OPPOSITION- NOTE. OVER THE PHONE A CONVERSATION WE HAD THIS WEEK I'LL I AM COMMITTED TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS BILL TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE THAT IT DOESN'T DO THAT. IT REALLY TRULY IS FOCUSED ON THE INDIVIDUALS WERE TALKING ABOUT HERE. AND I WE CANNOT DENY THAT THEY EXIST OKAY WE'VE SEEN IT. WE HAVE CERTAINLY SEEN IN THIS CASE. WHEN WE SEEN A YOUNG DEAL ROUTE WALK INTO A CHURCH IN CHARLESTON. JOIN A PRAYER GROUP WITH A BUNCH OF PEOPLE AND THEN PULL OUT A GUN AND START SHOOTING THEM. ONE WE'VE SEEN A YOUNG JUVENILE HERE AND DAVIS BRUTALLY MURDER AT A COUPLE IN THEIR HOME. AND SHOW ABSOLUTELY NO REMORSE THEY EXIST. WE DON'T LIKE TO THINK THAT THAT'S THE CASE AND NONE NOT WE WANT TO BELIEVE IN REHABILITATION WHICH WE DO BUT THERE ARE INDIVIDUALS OUT THERE AND WE HAVE TO HAVE A TOOL TO IDENTIFY THEM UNDER THE CURRENT POLICY RIGHT NOW THEY WILL NOT GET IDENTIFIED THEY WILL AUTOMATICALLY GET A PAROLE HEARING THAT'S THE THAT IS THE CASE RIGHT NOW TODAY I'M JUST TRYING TO PUT A SAFEGUARD IN THERE THAT PROTECTS THE UNDERLYING POLICY OF REHABILITATION OF JUVENILE OFFENDERS. BUT TRIES TO PROTECT AGAINST THOSE WHO ARE TRULY A DANGER. A LIMITED GROUP. AND I WOULD ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND CONSIDERATION. AGAIN I JUST I BAG OF THE COMMITTEE WORK WITH ME I'VE AGAIN ELSE I'VE SAID THIS BEFORE I'M A REPUBLICAN. I CAN'T RAIL ROAD THIS THING THROUGH. I WOULD I AM VERY MUCH WILLING TO WORK WITH OPPOSITION AND WHAT PEOPLE YOU HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT- AS WE MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD AND IF YOU WOULD GIVE ME THAT SUPPORT TODAY HAVE MY COMMITMENT TO KEEP WORKING ON IT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND I KNOW WE'VE- WE HAD SO CONVERSATIONS EVEN- I MADE ONE COMMITMENT TO YOU THAT THIS BILL WILL BE HEARD. AND HOPEFULLY TODAY I'VE AT LEAST GIVING YOU YOU MET YOUR WORD ON THAT MISTER JET BUT WORD ON THAT- AT INTO OB I KNOW WE'VE HAD SOME PHILOSOPHICAL. EVEN RELIGIOUS CONVERSATIONS- BACK AND FORTH ABOUT THIS ISSUE. OF. TO THE FAMILY- I KNOW SOMETIMES- YOU BELIEVE THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS DON'T HEAR YOU. I'M ONE THAT HAD HIS UNCLE KILLED. STAFF SEVEN TIME IN FRONT OF HIS CHILDREN. EVERY LAST MEMBER OF MY FAMILY OF THAT PART OF MY UNCLE BILL'S FAMILY ARE NOW IN SUBSTANCE ABUSE. OF HIS WIFE DIED OF ALCOHOLISM AFTER THAT IS INCIDENT. AND SO WHEN YOU SAY. OR YOU BELIEVE THAT WE HEAR APPEAR DON'T UNDERSTAND. THE PAIN YOU GO THROUGH THE PAIN AN ENTIRE FAMILY GOES THROUGH WHEN SOMEONE HEY MISLI KILL SOMEONE. YOU NEED TO. I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT WE DO. AND IT SOMETIMES- I HEAR FROM THE OTHER SIDE THAT WE DON'T WE ACTUALLY DO AND SO- I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT DAD I KNOW DAT IT DOESN'T START OR END WITH JUST ONE FAMILY MEMBER OR PERMITS TO THE WHOLE FAMILY. AND IN THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE THAT'S WHY YOUR REPRESENTATIVE IS HERE. THE SEARS. TO STAND UP FOR YOU BUT ALSO TO LET YOU KNOW BOTH YOU REPRESENTED LET YOU KNOW THAT- THEY FEEL YOU'RE PAID AND WHAT'S GOING ON. SO HERE'S MY. MY DILEMMA AND MOVING FORWARD AND I WILL COMMIT TO YOU THAT WE DO NEED TO SIT DOWN. AND TALK ABOUT THIS IN IN A IN A SUBSTANTIVE WAY AND TRY TO GET TO US A SOLUTION ONE. I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE- LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THE MEETING WITH YOU ANY ACTIVISTS IN THE MEETING. BECAUSE ONE I WANT TO SEE WHAT PROBLEM WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE. I THINK I'VE TOLD STORIES. OF WHEN I WAS IN CATHOLIC SCHOOL AND I HAD- A RELIGION CLASS WERE A NON GOT UP AND SAID ASKED THE CLASS IN RELIGION CLASS IF YOU DIED TODAY YOU WANT TO HAVE AN- AND YOU LOOKED UP AND YOU SAW ADOLF HITLER SIT NEXT TO JESUS CHRIST AND MAYBE IT'LL SMART BOARD FROM SOUTH LA PM BUS TO AN ALL WHITE SCHOOL. IN PLAINVILLE CONNECTICUT I SAID I THINK I WAS IN THE WRONG HAPPEN. AND THE NON POINTED OUT WHAT IF. AND WE'VE TALKED ABOUT MATTHEW. NINETEEN TWENTY FIVE. TWENTY SIX WHO CAN BE SAVED. AND WITH MANTISES APOSTAS IS IMPOSSIBLE BUT WITH GOD. ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE. WE. AS WE LOOK AT THAT THE MOST HORRIBLE PERSON IN THE WORLD BAR NONE. BAR NONE IF IN MY RELIGION AT THE TIME OF HIS DEATH. HE WAS. REPENTED OF ALL HIS SENT. THERE IS SOMEONE THAT WOULD SAY THAT HE- COULD BE READING. WHO IS IT AMONG US THAT SAID THAT THIS INDIVIDUAL CAN'T BE READING NO MATTER HOW HEINOUS. IS SO IN YOUR TIMELINE. IT IS PROBLEMATIC CUTTING OFF PAROLE HEARINGS BECAUSE IN THIS TIME SOMEBODY SAYS THEY CAN'T BE REDEEMED OR THAT PERSON IS IRREPARABLY OF DAMAGE THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S WANTING TO THE REASON I WANT TO PULL AND EVEN PROBATION HOW MANY PEOPLE DO THEY DEAL WITH WHO HAVE GOTTEN OUT TO THE SOUTH LIKE THE SYSTEM ITSELF. IS WORKING. AT AYE A NOTE MISSED CENTER NIELSEN WAS ON A PAROLE BOARD HE MADE SURE THAT NO ONE. GOT OUT. THAT WAS STEP FIT THIS DESCRIPTION- I KNOW MR CENTER NIELSEN VERY WELL FOR. TO KNOW THAT SO IT ALSO SEEMS LIKE THE SYSTEM WORK SO I REALLY WANT TO HAVE A DISCUSSION. IF THIS BILL DOESN'T MAKE IT OUT I REALLY WANT HAVE A TRUE DISCUSSION OR HOW MANY HEINOUS PEOPLE ARE RE WE CLOSE THAT GAP IF THERE'S A PROBLEM. TO THAT'S- THAT SEEMS LIKE TO. THAT'S A REALLY WERE WERE TRYING TO GET TO. AND HOW DO WE HOW DO WE FOCUS LIKE A LASER. ON AND I DON'T WANT TO PUT IN MEET NOT I HEARD ONCE I WANT PERCENT YOU YOU MAY THINK IT'S 5% BUT WHATEVER THAT NUMBER IS. HOW DO WE GET TO WHAT. THAT AND THAT'S ONE IT INTO WHAT WAS TO QUIRK IS CONCERNED ABOUT BURDENING FAMILY MEMBERS A BIRDIE FAMILIES FROM COMING BACK AND FORTH. ON TO THE- HEARING AIDS- WHICH I DON'T THINK WE I THINK WE DISAGREED ON WHETHER OR NOT IS THREE YEARS THREE MONTHS EIGHTEEN MONTHS. SOME PEOPLE BELIEVE IT CLOSE TO THE A DECADE OR FIFTEEN YEARS BEFORE THEY COME BACK AND WIN CAUGHT BETWEEN GET SOME AGREEMENT ON THAT AND I THINK- WORKING WITH BOTH SIDES WE CAN GET IN A ROOM AND MAYBE GET SOME STATISTICS TO SHOW PEOPLE WHO FIT THAT CATEGORY THAT WE ARE IN FACT BERNIE PEOPLE TO COME BACK TO OFFER WHICH I THINK IS ANOTHER. KEY COMPONENT TO OF PUTTING IT UNFAIR A BURDEN ON FAMILY MEMBERS TO COME BACK AND FORTH AND SO- UNFORTUNATE OUR RECOMMENDED NO VOTE BUT I'M ALSO GOING TO COMMIT TO YOU LIKE I COMMITTED TO HEARING. HAVING HERE TO HEAR THIS BILL IS COMMITTEE THAT WE BRING EVERYBODY IN THE ROOM. AND TALK RELEASED ABOUT THOSE TWO ISSUES. AND THEN MAYBE WE CRAFT SOMETHING THAT ACTUALLY PUT A ONE DETERMINE THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM. AND THEN WE CAN FOCUS LIKE A LASER I DON'T MEAN TO OVER SIMPLIFY BUT THOSE ARE LIKE MIKE. MY TWO MAIN CONCERNS WITH THAT. I APPRECIATE NAY MOVED TO APPROVE. ON AB SIX SIXTY FIVE GALLAGHER THE MOTION IS TO PASS THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER. CHEN SERRANO LACKEY. LACKEY I BAUER-KAHAN DEEP DEEP I KAMLAGER KAMLAGER NO QUIRK. QUIRK NOTES SANTIAGO WICKS WICKS NOW. THAT MEASURE FAILED IN THIS COMMITTEE BUT IT DIDN'T FAIL. OKAY THANK YOU CHAIRMAN I APPRECIATE THAT COMMITMENT A WILL AND WE WILL TAKE YOU UP ON OKAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR COMMITTEE MEMBER. THANK YOU I'LL WORK WITH YOU WITH WHAT YES I NEED SOME INPUT FROM YOU TO. OKAY. MR FLOOR DO YOU WANT TO WAIT FOR FEW FEW PEOPLE. DELETED EVERYWHERE. RIGHT PRESENTATION OF. WAIT BE DOING. OKAY SO YOU'RE ALLOWED TO FACE. SO WE WORKED OUT SO NOW THAT WE'VE CLEARED THE SHE. A COUPLE WITNESSES TRYING HARD. NOR ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE. THIS SEEMS TO BE APPROVED. IT SCARES ME. SO. BUT EVERYBODY. WE ALL GREW UP WITH. HI WHENEVER YOU'RE READY MISTER FLOOR ALL RIGHT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS I'M SURE YOU'VE HEARD A BUNCH OF TIMES THEY'VE A HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO THE CHAIR I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB FIVE OH THREE WHICH ALLOW CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS TO CARRY C. C. W.'S WHILE ATTENDING RELIGIOUS SERVICES LOCATE ON SCHOOL PROPERTY ONLY AFTER RECEIVING WRITTEN PERMISSION FROM THE SCHOOL TWO YEARS AGO INTRODUCED HIS BILL AFTER A GUNMAN KILLED TWENTY SIX PEOPLE AT A CHURCH IN TEXAS LAST MONTH THE GUNMAN ENTERED ANOTHER CHURCH IN TEXAS KILLING TO MORE PEOPLE. BEFORE A VOLUNTEER SECURITY GUARD TOOK HIM DOWN A VOLUNTEER SECURITY GUARD THESE TWO INTO THE SHOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ARM SECURE THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT OUR SECURITY CAN HVE IN PROTECTING A PLACE OF WORSHIP ACCORDING TO WASHINGTON POST STUDY 86% OF PUBLIC SHOOTINGS PUBLIC MASS SHOOTINGS TOOK PLACE IN A GUN FREE SCHOOLS ON BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AD NINE AND TWO THOUSAND AND SIX. AB FIVE WITH THREE WAS IN IT IS FOR THIS VERY REASON NOT EVERY RELIGIOUS STATION CAN AFFORD TO HIRE SECURITY I UNDERSTAND THAT A RECENT BILL ESTABLISH A GRANT PROGRAM FOR NONPROFITS THE REALITY IS THERE IS ENOUGH MONEY AND THERE WILL NEVER BE. ENOUGH PROVIDE ONGOING SECURITY COSTS. WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE IN THIS GROUP WINNERS AND LOSERS AB FIVE WITH. MAJORED NERA APPROACH FOR SOME OF CALIFORNIANS SOFTEST TARGETS. I WANT TO MAKE IT VERY CLEAR THAT THIS BILL HAS A NUMBER OF SAFEGUARDS INCLUDING. REQUIREMENT OF AN INDIVIDUAL TO HAVE A CONCEALED WEAPON PERMIT. WRITTEN APPROVAL FROM THE SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT OR DESIGNEES. THE PERMIT ONLY BE VALID FOR ONE YEAR. ON PUBLIC SCHOOL GROUNDS. AND THE PERSON IS ONLY ALLOWED TO CARRY WHILE ATTENDING RELIGIOUS SERVICES. THIS DOES NOT IMPACT EVERY SCHOOL NORRIS EVERY SCHOOL REQUIRED TO PARTICIPATE. AB FIVE WITH WE WOULD SIMPLY INSURE THAT CAN. CONGRESSIONAL CONGREGATIONS OF ALL FAITHS HAVE THE ABILITY PROTECT THEMSELVES AS THEY SEE FIT REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY'RE LOCATED. WELL MAINTAIN ABSOLUTE AUTHORITY OF THE SCHOOL. GOT A COUPLE WITNESSES HERE I'M IN THE OFFICE AND TACKLES SUPPORTED AND THE WITNESS. GOOD MORNING MEMBERS OF PUBLIC SAFETY OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE MY NAME IS LIZ THAT MOSCOW AND I'M WITH THE LIBERTY FIRST FOUNDATION. OUR ORGANIZATION SUPPORT STRONGLY AB FIVE OH THREE SPONSORED BY HEATH FLORA. EVERY CITIZEN DESERVES THE RIGHT TO WORSHIP WITHOUT FEAR OF INJURY OR LOSS OF LIFE. EVERY MOTHER AND FATHER DESERVES TO BE. NOT IN FEAR OF SENDING THEIR CHILD TO SCHOOL. FOR THEY MAY LOSE THEIR LIFE OR BE INJURED RECENTLY WE HAVE THE EGREGIOUS ACTIONS OF A MAN AND OUR CHURCH IN WHITE SETTLEMENT TEXAS THAT SINCE THE C. ENDED THE LIFE OF TWO PARISHIONERS. IF IT WERE NOT FOR THE TRAINING AND THE FIREARM THAT MISTER JACK WILSON HAD WE HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH LOSS OF LIFE WOULD HAVE OCCURRED THAT DAY. THE INCIDENT WAS OVER IN A MERE SIX SECONDS AND NOT ONE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER COULD HAVE MADE IT THERE IN THAT TIME. NO ONE. IT CONSIDERS THEMSELVES THE HERO AND MISTER WILSON CERTAINLY DOES NOT EITHER. BUT HE CONSIDERS HIMSELF A MAN OF GOOD VERSUS EVIL. UNFORTUNATELY WILL NEVER GET THE CRIMINALS TO SURRENDER ANY TYPE OF WEAPON TO LAW ENFORCEMENT BUT WHAT WE CAN DO IS BE PREPARED. AB FIVE OH THREE AMENDMENT SHOULD BE TREATED AS A GOOD VERSUS EVIL BILL. CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF THE MOST RESTRICTIVE STATES TO OBTAIN A CONCEALED WEAPONS PERMIT I AM A PERMIT HOLDER MYSELF DUE TO A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE INCIDENT. AND THE PROCESS INCLUDES A HANDGUN SAFETY COURSE APPLICATION INTERVIEW WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT BACKGROUND SCREENING SYNTAX AND SIXTEEN HOURS OF TRAINING INCLUDING LIVE FIRING AVERAGING OVER FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE DOLLARS. THEN THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE THE CONTINUOUS PROPER NESS THAT WE HAVE TO CONTINUE OUR OWN COST UP TO A THOUSAND DOLLARS PER COURSE TO STAY PREPARED. I AM HERE TO ASK YOU GRACIOUSLY TO GRAB EACH CITIZEN THE CHOICE TO BE SAFE AB FIVE OH THREE GIVES TRAIN CITIZENS A CHOICE TO PROTECT THEIR LOVED ONES I HAVE A DAUGHTER THAT GOES TO CSU FULLERTON. AND IT SCARES ME EVERY DAY THAT SHE WALKS ON THAT CAMPUS THAT WE DON'T HAVE SOMEONE THERE THAT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PROTECT MY CHILD. I URGE YOU TO PLEASE EVALUATE THIS BILL AND WE ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF IT THANK YOU. USE. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- HAPPY TWENTY TWENTY- WERE HERE- HERE FOR NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION STRONG SUPPORT ALSO HERE FOR GUN OWNERS A CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA RIFLE AND PISTOL ASSOCIATION ALSO ARE INSTRUCTORS FOR WANT TO THANK YOU TO THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR BRINGING THIS IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION AND I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND. HOW WE GOT HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE- FOR DECADES IF YOU HAD A CONCEALED CARRY PERMIT IN THE CITY CALIFORNIA COULD CARRY. ON PUBLIC OR PRIVATE SCHOOLS AND NEVER ONCE THAT I'M AWARE OF THAT WE HAVE A CCW HOLDER THE KASSON ISSUE. FAST FORWARD TO TWENTY FIFTEEN WITH THE PASSAGE OF AB SEVEN OH SEVEN THAT SAID CCW HOLDERS ARE NOT A LOT OF PUBLIC PRIVATE SCHOOLS AND LAST THERE IS PERMISSION. AND THEN PASSWORD AGAIN TWO YEARS LATER- BECAUSE SOME OF THAT DISCRETION WAS ACTUALLY ALLOWING CCW HOLDERS TO CONTINUE TO CARRY ON THE SCHOOLS- WE HAVE THE PASSAGE OF AB FOR TWENTY FOUR WHICH JUST IS A FLAT OUT BÃ N. BUT ONE OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF THAT BILL WAS CHURCHES. THERE ARE CHURCHES AND OTHER RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS THAT HAVE PRIVATE SCHOOLS ASSOCIATED WITH IT. OR WHEN SCHOOL NOT IN SESSION OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS THEIR MEETING THERE- FOR EXAMPLE THE CHURCH THAT I TEND. IS NOW UNDER SOME RENOVATIONS AND SO THEY'RE MEETING AT A LOCAL PUBLIC SCHOOL BUT BECAUSE OF CALIFORNIA LAW YOU CANNOT HAVE A CCW HOLDERS ON THAT SCHOOL CAMP. OUT BRING MAJOR MAJOR CRIMINAL PENALTIES- AND THERE'S ONLY VERY VERY MINOR EXCEPTIONS FOR. LAW ENFORCEMENT EXETER OF. AND SO WHAT THIS BILL IS IT'S VERY NARROW. AND IT'S SAYING DURING THE TIME OF THOSE RELIGIOUS SERVICES IF THERE'S PERMISSION FROM THE SCHOOL OF THE AUTHORITY THAT YOU CAN CARRY AND SO THE CHURCHES CAN THEN MAKE. IMPORTANT SECURITY DECISIONS SO- IF YOU YOU KNOW THE EXAMPLE OF TEXAS WAS USE RECENTLY WHERE YOU HAD SOMEONE ON SITE THERE WAS A VOLUNTEER WITH THE CHURCH IT WAS ABLE TO RESPOND TO A THREAT. IS IT THE TODAY. LAWS ARE NOT STOP ADMITTED FROM SEEING GUN FREE ZONES. OR AREAS THAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED. TO DID SPECIALLY WHEN THESE PEOPLE ARE NOT EVEN ALLOWED TO CARRY IN THE FIRST PLACE. AND SO- THIS IS JUST A VERY VERY NARROW CARVE OUT FOR THESE RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS. DURING THE TIME OF WORSHIP. I'M IN ALSO COMES DOWN TO PRIVATE PROPERTY- ISSUE SOME OF THESE ARE PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS OR PRIVATE SCHOOLS. AND WE'RE DICTATING HOW THEY CAN- MAKE THEIR IMPORTANT SECURITY DECISIONS AND SO. I THINK THIS IS A GREAT BILL IT'S VERY NARROW. IT LOOKS BACK AT THE ISSUES FROM- EIGHTY SEVEN OH SEVEN EIGHTY FOUR TWENTY FOUR AND I REALLY ENCOURAGE YOUR SUPPORT. T. THANK YOU ARE ANY ANYONE ELSE TO SUPPORT BILL. ANYONE IN OPPOSITION GOOD MORNING MY NAME'S REBECCA MARQUESS I'M REPRESENTING BRADY UNITED AGAINST GUN VIOLENCE WELL WE SURE THE AUTHOR'S GOAL OF REDUCING GUN VIOLENCE ON SCHOOL CAMPUSES DURING RELIGIOUS SERVICES WE'RE SPREE RESPECTIVELY DISAGREE THAT AB FIVE OF THREE IS THE VEHICLE TO ACHIEVE THAT GOAL LOOSENING RESTRICTIONS ON CONCEALED CARRY FIREARMS IN CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS OWNS IS CONTRARY TO THE NEED FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO INCREASE PROTECTIONS FOR CHILDREN YOUTH AND THE COMMUNITY FROM GUN VIOLENCE RESEARCH SHOWS IT EASIER ACCESS TO FIRE ARMS INCREASES THE REST THE CHILDREN AND YOUTH WILL BE INJURED OR KILLED BY GUNS. MAKING THE CONCEALED CARRY OF FIREARMS EASIER AS A THREAT TO CHILDREN SAFETY MANY SCHOOL FACILITIES ARE USED BY CHILDREN FAMILIES AND THE COMMUNITY AFTER HOURS OR ON WEEKENDS YOU SPORT LEAGUES ARE OFTEN HOLDING PRACTICES OR GAMES CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES MAY BE USING THE PLAYGROUND OR YOUNG CHILDREN ARE LEARNING TO RIDE THEIR BIKES ON THE BLACK TOP. EVEN HIGHLY TRAINED OFFICER WHOSE ONLY JOB IS LAW ENFORCEMENT ARE ALL TOO OFTEN THEY FAILED TO USE FIREARMS SUCCESSFULLY OUR FOCUS SHOULD REMAIN ON PREVENTING GUNS GETTING INTO OUR PLACES OF WORSHIP AND SCHOOLS RATHER THAN RELYING CONGREGANTS TO PREVENT AND SHOOT AT. I. RESPECTIVELY ASK THE COMMITTEE WARNED ABOUT. THANK YOU YES. GOOD MORNING SANDRA BREYER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION- I ONE ALIGN MYSELF WITH MISS MARKETS HIS COMMENTS AND I JUST WANT TO ADD THAT- PEACE OFFICERS AN ARMED SECURITY GUARDS COMPLETE TRAINING SPECIFICALLY TO RESPOND TO EMERGENCY SITUATIONS AND WE KNOW THAT MISTAKES STILL HAPPEN- AND FOR SCHOOL PEACE OFFICERS THAT ARE RESPONDING TO A CRISIS SITUATION ON A CAMPUS IF MULTIPLE PEOPLE HAVE A FIRE ARM BUT IT'S TO MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO IDENTIFY. WHO ACTUALLY IS SALTING THE STANCE- WOULD CALIFORNIA SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION STRONGLY OPPOSES THIS BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU. ARE IS ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. A. BACKUP POWER QUE HAN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I WILL ADD MY HAPPY BIRTHDAY AS WELL SINCE IT'S MY FIRST OPPORTUNITY- I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR HIS INTENT HERE AS HE AND I DISCUSSED I SAT ON THE BOARD OF MY CONGREGATION RIGHT DROP MY KIDS OFF SEVERAL TIMES A WEEK FOR SUNDAY SCHOOL AND RELIGIOUS SCHOOL AND- WE ALL KNOW HOW SCARY THAT IS RIGHT NOW AND I'M SO I SERVEDACTUALLY AS MY SUNDAY SCHOOL SECURITY GUARD ON SUNDAY. NOT ARMED AND. ASH AND EVERYONE WAS SAFE WHEN THEY LEFT IN RITUAL TO KNOW BUT YOU KNOW I DON'T I JUST I. SHARE THE CONCERNS OF THE OPPOSITION THAT MORE GUNS DON'T MAKE US SAFER. AND THAT- YOU KNOW ALLOWING MORE PEOPLE TO CARRY GUNS I NOT THE SOLUTION BUT WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON HOW WE GET GUNS OUT OF THE HANDS OF PEOPLE WHO SHOULDN'T HAVE THEM. AND ENSURE THAT OUR COMMUNITIES ARE SAFE AND I KNOW THAT MY- MY CONGREGANTS SHARE THAT. AND THAT. YOU KNOW I JUST I APPRECIATE THE DESIRE TO KEEP PEOPLE SAFE IN THEIR HOUSE OF WORSHIP BECAUSE I KNOW I WORRY ABOUT IT SEVERAL TIMES A WEEK. BUT THAT AND THAT'S WHY I WAS A HUGE PROPONENT WITH THE JEWISH CAUCUS OF THE NONPROFIT SECURITY GRANTS THAT WE- WERE ABLE TO PASS THIS YEAR- THEY WERE ZEROED OUT. IN THE BUDGET THAT WAS INTRODUCED EARLIER THIS WEEK AND SO I URGE US ALL TO WORK TOGETHER TO ENSURE WE CONTINUE TO PROTECT THE SAFETY OF. CONGREGATIONS OF ALL FAITHS THROUGH THAT PROGRAM. BUT THAT THIS IS NOT THE SOLUTION. YES ANYONE ELSE. YES MISTER QUIRK YEAH- WE HAVE VERY GOOD EVIDENCE THE MORE PEOPLE HAVE GUNS THE MORE OUR GUN DEATHS THERE ARE BOB AND IF YOU LOOK AT TEXAS VERSUS CALIFORNIA FARMER GUN DEATHS ARE EVEN IF YOU WERE TO BE ABLE TO PREVENT A DEATH AT A SCHOOL THIS WAY A YOU WOULD HAVE FAR MORE GUN DEATHS IF WE WERE TO OPEN THIS UP- YOU CAN EVEN SEE THAT FOR EXAMPLE SAN FRANCISCO ON A PER PERSON BASIS AS FEWER GUN DEATHS. VAN THE RED COUNTIES WHERE C. C. W.'S ARE GIVEN MORE OFTEN SO I JUST CANNOT DO I WILL NOT SUPPORT ANYTHING THAT LOOSENS UP OUR- GUN CONTROL BILLS. MR LACKEY. YEAH I THINK I MIGHT HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO TRY TO BRING BALANCE TO THIS DISCUSSION. THAT THERE IS ACTUALLY A ROLE. FOR WEAPONS TO BE USED AS DEFENSIVE. CIRCUMSTANCES AND THAT IS CLEARLY THE CASE THE SUN AUTHORS TRYING TO PRESENT. GUNS ARE. EVERYBODY WANTS TO GENERALIZE GUNS IN THE ABUSIVE CIRCUMSTANCES AND WE SHOULD PAY ATTENTION TO THAT. BUT. EVEN THE TERM GUN VIOLENCE IS DISTURBING TO ME BECAUSE IT IT FOCUSES ON THE WEAPON AND NOT THE BEHAVIOR BEHIND IT AND I THINK THAT THAT'S MISSING THE MARK TERRIBLY AND I THINK WHO CARRIES THE GUN. IS WHAT DEFINES FOR THAT GUN AS A THREAT OR WHETHER IT'S- A TOOL. TO DEFEND THE INNOCENT. AND I THINK CLEARLY WHAT WE HAVE HERE. IS A PROCESS THAT'S BEEN PROPOSED THAT WE WOULD. ASSURE THE PEOPLE THAT WOULD BE CARRYING THE GUN. ARE THERE TO PROTECT THE INNOCENT. AND NOT TO USE AN OFFENSIVE WEAPON I CARRIED A WEAPON FOR TWENTY EIGHT YEARS OF MY SIDE. LOADED AND I WAS FULLY TRAINED AND IT SAVED ME FROM HAPPEN TO USE VIOLENCE IT SAVED ME FROM ENGAGING IN A PEOPLE WHO WERE ARMED. AND I'M TELLING YOU THAT TO OVER GENERALIZE GUNS AS THE DEMON. IS MISDIRECTED. IT'S THE BEHAVIOR BEHIND THE GUN THAT NEEDS FOCUS AND THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS HERE AND I COMMEND THANK YOU. THANK YOU. YOU. WITH COME UNDER THE- I'M I JUST WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR- WANTING TO ENGAGE IN A CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW TO KEEP COMMUNITIES SAFE- I DO ALSO AGREE HOWEVER WITH- THE OPPOSITION AND SOME OF MY FELLOW COLLEAGUES ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES ON THE DÃ­AS- IN SOME FORM OR ANOTHER. FOR ME THE QUESTIONS- BEHIND THIS BILL. OUR OUR MINI ONE- SORT OF CHALLENGING THE LIABILITY AND WHO ACTUALLY HAS A LIABILITY ON PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS THERE THEN ALSO BECOMES A QUESTION OF THE SUBJECTIVITY OF THE PERSON AUTHORIZING THE USE I MEAN. YOU KNOW THE PEOPLE ARE WOULD BE GRANTING THE AUTHORITY FOR SOMEONE TO COME ON TO. MY CAMPUS ARMED AND THEY'RE A SUBJECTIVITY IN THAT PERSON THAT SUPERINTENDENTS ABILITY TO MAKE A DECISION OR DETERMINATION AND IF- BIAS OR SORT OF PROFILING CREEPS INTO THAT AND THEN UNFORTUNATELY IT'S JUST A VERY SLIPPERY SLOPE FOR ME AND TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT PRIVATE MILITIA. AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS INCREDIBLY SCARY TO ME- AS A BLACK WOMAN AS A PARENT- AS A WIFE- IN AS A NEIGHBOR- MANY OF THE- HOUSES OF WORSHIP THAT ARE RENTING SPACES ON OUR SKIN IS. CUTER. COMMUTER HAVE. BEEN IS THE OUT. IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THAT. AND THE NEIGHBORHOOD IF THOSE- HOMES OF HOUSES OF WORSHIP NO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTUALLY LIVING IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHO MAY BE SPECIAL NEEDS ARE WHO WAS A LITTLE QUIRKY AND THEN YOU HAVE FOLKS WHO ARE GUARDING- IN THESE- PLACES OF WORSHIP NOT REALLY KNOWING THE INTRICACIES AND THE NEW WANTS OF THIS COMMUNITY. OUT WHO ARE LOADED IN ARMED AND THEN BAD THINGS HAPPEN SO FOR ME THEIR JUST SO MANY QUESTIONS. THAT THIS RAISES RATHER THAN ANSWERS THAT I UNFORTUNATELY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SUPPORT. WITH THAT YOU MAY CLOSE YOUR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR ALLOW THIS BILL TO BE HEARD AGAIN I THINK THERE IS A FUNDAMENTAL. MISUNDERSTANDING OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE. YOU KNOW AND I RESPECTFULLY HAVE TO COMPLETELY DISAGREE WITH THE OPPOSITION ON ON SOME OF THESE ISSUES. BECAUSE A FIREARM. IN A TRAINED INDIVIDUALS HANDS. IS FAR MORE EFFECTIVE THAN WAITING ON LAW ENFORCEMENT TO GET THERE IN OUR AREA OUR RESPONSE TIMES ARE ANYWHERE BETWEEN SIX. AND NINE MINUTES BEFORE LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN GET THERE. THERE'S A LOT OF DAMAGE THAT CAN BE DONE. WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE. IS A CHURCH. CONNECTED TO A SCHOOL. THAT WAS AN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES I DO BELIEVE OF THE PREVIOUS LEGISLATION THAT WAS NOT THOUGHT THROUGH. BECAUSE NOW THAT CHURCH DOES NOT HAVE THE ABILITY ALREADY PUT IN PLACE SECURITY TEAMS DO NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO PROTECT THEIR CONGREGATIONS. SO WHEN THEY'RE ALL FACING THE PEWS FOR THE FACING THE PASTOR. THEIR BACKS TO THE DOOR. AND THERE'S NOBODY LOOKING OUT FOR. AND WE KNOW THIS WORLD GONE A LITTLE CRAZY. BUT I'M TELLING YOU RIGHT NOW THIS BILL IS ONE OF THOSE BILLS THAT CAN ABSOLUTELY SAVE LIVES. AND I UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S- IT'S- STILL HARD FOR SOME MY COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER SIDE OUT TO SUPPORT THESE KINDS OF BILLS. BUT THIS IS ONE OF THOSE BILLS THAT I FUNDAMENTALLY BELIEVE. IF WE DON'T DO SOMETHING SOON IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IT'S GONNA HAPPEN. AND THEN WE'RE ALL GONNA BLAME THE GUNS AS OPPOSED TO ALLOWING GOOD GUYS TO BE THERE GOOD GUYS TO BE ON STAFF GOOD GUYS TO BE ON SITE TO PROTECT THE CONTENTS THE COMMUNITY WE ALL TALK ABOUT WE WANNA DO EVERYTHING FOR COMMITTEES TO BE SAFE HEALTHY WE DO TONS OF LEGISLATION TO DO THIS. BUT NOW WE'RE CREATING SOFT TARGETS WERE ADVERTISING TO PEOPLE WHO WANT TO DO PEOPLE HARM. THAT WE CAN'T HAVE GUNS AT THIS PLACE IF YOU WANT TO GO AND PUT THE MOST DAMAGE GO THERE. BECAUSE COPTERS SIX MINUTES AWAY. WERE ADVERTISING THIS WE'RE GIVING THEM JUST FREE REIN ON US ON OUR COMMUNITY. SO I'M JUST SAYING I UNDERSTAND THIS IS HARD AND IS THERE'S A REASON THIS BILL BEEN HERE FOR THREE YEARS OKAY. AND IT'S BEEN A GREAT DISCUSSION. AND I WOULD LOVE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR WE'VE WE'VE TALKED A LITTLE BIT YOU KNOW AND IF THERE IS ADDITIONAL TRAINING. YOU KNOW IN ADDITION TO THE CCW PERMIT HOLDERS IF THERE IS A WAY THAT WE CAN GET INTO SOME OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS I'M OPEN TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION. BUT IF WE DO NOT DO SOMETHING. IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME. AND THERE'S DATA UPON DATA THAT SHOWS WHEN GOOD PEOPLE HAVE GUNS. BAD PEOPLE ARE STOP QUICKER. AND THAT IS JUST RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. THANK YOU- YES WE'VE HAD ONGOING DISCUSSIONS AND I THINK THAT THE AT THE. BUT THE CRUX OF IT IS THE WHO. I REALLY IS TO END UP AT A AT A THINK IT'S LESS. THE WEAPONS THEN THE WHO AND THE REASON I SAY THAT. WE'RE WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT HOW DO YOU TRAIN THESE INDIVIDUALS EVEN REPRESENTATIVE- ASSEMBLY MEMBER POWER QUE AND- IN HER RELIGION AND WHERE THEY HAVE PLACES OF WORSHIP THEY HIRED A TAKEN A FOR SOME MANY OF THOSE CONGREGANTS CAN AFFORD TO HIRE. WELL TRAINED SECURITY OFFICERS TO PROTECT THE CONGREGANTS. WHICH IS WHICH IS HUGE. AND SO I THINK I TALK TO YOU ABOUT. FUNDS. MAYBE USE THOSE FUNDS AND HOPEFULLY LAW ENFORCEMENT NOT LISTENING BUT MAYBE EVEN MAKE IT POST CERTIFIED. SO THAT- EATING HERE THAT SO THAT. THEY PROVIDE SOME COMFORT BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE BETTER READING THIS YOU HERE AND EVEN MR LACKEY SAYS I'M A WELL TRAINED INDIVIDUAL WITH THE FIRE WE'RE NEVER GOING TO QUESTION HIS FIREARM BECAUSE IT'S IN HIS HAND WE DON'T QUESTION LAW ENFORCEMENT. ABILITY TO USE A FIREARM BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN WELL TRAINED AFTER WELL TRAINED IN USING IT APPROPRIATELY WERE WERE OKAY WITH THAT AND SO. THAT WAS KIND OF THE DISCUSSION I WANT TO HAVE. WITH YOU ABOUT HOW TO MOVE FORWARD BECAUSE- ALL OF US ARE ARE. ARE NOT COMFORTABLE WITH SOMEONE WITH A FIRE OF BED IS NOT TRAINED TO PROFICIENCY STANDARDS THAT WE ALL IT HAS TO BE IS IT'S UP HERE IS NOT JUST KINDA EVERYBODY'S HERE AND WE'RE OKAY NO WE'VE WE'VE GOT A UP LEVEL BACK SO THAT- THAT CAN HAPPEN DISCUSSION YOU WE WERE HAVING HIS YOU KNOW WHERE YOU ARE. THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO AFFORD. THAT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS THAT YOU MAY NEED TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT MAYBE THESE GRANTS. CAN HELP WITH THAT AND SO I WOULD LIKE TO IT DOESN'T GET OUT OF THERE LIKE TO HAVE THAT KIND OF DISCUSSION. I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THIS DISCUSSION WITH YOU BECAUSE I MEAN ON THE TRAINING SIDE OF IT I MEAN WE'RE ABSOLUTELY OPEN TO ALL OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS RIGHT AND THEN ALSO LOOK AT HOW HOW LONG. I MEAN WE- COULD MAY NOT. AS FOR SOMEONE STATE MAY NOT HAPPEN OVERNIGHT. BUT IF WE START TO TRAIN UP. INDIVIDUALS THAT WE FEEL UNBELIEVABLY COMFORTABLE. WITH TO BE ABLE TO- SIT IN ANY CHURCH. AND BE ABLE TO. ADD A PREREQUISITE TRAINING BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED IN THE CHURCH AND IN THE INCIDENT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT. NOT ONLY WAS IS A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER THAT TRAINED EVERYONE IN FACT I THINK THE FIRST PERSON THAT WAS SHOT WAS WANTED PEOPLE WHO TRAIN- NIGHT HAVE A CADRE OF PEOPLE. THAT ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING I SHOULD KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH A FIREARM. AND WE'RE ALSO CONCERNED THAT ONE DAY YOU WILL NOT ONLY WILL YOU SEE SOMEONE COMING IN. TO A CHURCH A CIGNA CAUGHT OR WHEREVER. AND INNOCENT PEOPLE WERE KILLED BECAUSE THE PERSON THAT WE THOUGHT. AT THE GUN A GOOD GUY WITH THE GUN MAKES A MISTAKE AND SHOOT ANOTHER GOOD PERSON WITHOUT A GUN AND THAT'S KIND OF WHAT YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE FEELING WITH SOME OF THE SOME OF THE OTHER PEOPLE HERE OF THAT WE DON'T ALSO DON'T EXACERBATE THE SITUATION BECAUSE SOMEONE IS NOT WELL TRAINED. INTO A TEN FORTUNATELY- BUT I DID HEAR MOTION BY PRETTY SURE I WILL. AT THE MOVE THE BILL. AN EIGHTY FIVE A THREE THE MOTION IS TO PASS JONES SAWYER JONES SAWYER NO LACKEY LACKEY I PARA CAN. DEEP. DEEP NOT VOTING KAMLAGER KAMLAGER NO QUIRK YOU KNOW QUIRK NO SANTIAGO. WICKS. MAJOR FAILS START IF YOU. MR MCCARTY. AB EIGHT FIVE FIVE DEPARTMENT JUST AS LAW ENFORCEMENT POLICIES ON THE USE OF FORCE. GOOD MORNING. IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO SAY HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO EVERYBODY ELSE HAS SO GO AHEAD YES IT WOULD BE IT YES I THANK YOU- I KNOW I'M THE LAST BILL HERE TODAY AND- YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT THIS BILL- ISHE BUILDS UPON THE GREAT WORK THAT THIS COMMITTEE LEGISLATURE DID LAST YEAR WITH- AB THREE NINE TWO AND SB TWO THIRTY THAT THE USE OF FORCE A POLICIES WHICH AS WE KNOW THE VERY END WAS A BIPARTISAN EFFORT IT TOOK A LOT OF WORK TO MAKE SURE THAT WE- REFORM OUR PRACTICES REAP RELATED DEADLY FORCE IN CALIFORNIA. AND THIS WOULD WOULD WOULD WOULD BUILD UPON THAT LINK JUST LIKE THAT A STEP BACK HERE A YEAR AGO WE HAD A FULL TWO YEARS AGO AT A FLASHPOINT HERE IN SACRAMENTO WITH THAT FATAL- DEATH OF A YOUNG MAN STEFAN CLARK WHICH WAS ONE OF THE DRIVERS TO THOSE BILLS WE PASSED LAST YEAR IN THE AFTERMATH OF THAT OUR CITY OF SACRAMENTO- POLICE DEPARTMENT ASKED THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE TO CONDUCT A REVIEW OF THEIR POLICIES AND PRACTICES. NOT JUST ABOUT THAT INCIDENT BUT THEIR ENTIRE PRACTICE TO COME ABOUT WITH RECOMMENDATIONS HOW DO EVOLVING PROVE THAT DEPARTMENT INSTANTLY WITH THE CHAINS BUT THE LAWS BEING WITH. YOU BUT YOU KNOW THE REALLY A GOOD POINT THAT WE WANT TO BRING ABOUT THROUGH THE THROUGH THE REST OF CALIFORNIA SO THEY HAD AN AND NINETY SEVEN PAGE REPORT RIGHT HERE WITH A BUNCH OF RECOMMENDATIONS AND THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO IN THE POLICE DEPARTMENT A BRACE THE BUNCH OF THOSE- SOMEWHERE IT LIKE THE FLEEING FELON POLICY WERE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DO IN A PRACTICE AND- FOOT PURSUITS MAKES SPEAKING ABOUT PROMOTE PUBLIC SAFETY BUT ALSO YOU KNOW KEEP INDIVIDUALS AND COMMUNITIES SAFER AS WELL. SO WE KNOW THERE IS SOMETIMES A NOT ALWAYS IT NOT TRAFFIC COMMUNITIES FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT SO THIS ACTUALLY WAS THAT'S A GREAT EXAMPLE OF WHAT CAN BE DONE WHEN THAT PART TAKES A STEP BACK AND SOMEBODY ELSE TO MEN AND HELP TURNING OLD IT AT A FANTASTIC JOB. STILL BE TODAY IT WOULD BE LEE. I'M PROUD THAT. THIS PROCESS. DO YOU TO. TURN YOU GENERAL'S OFFICE TO DO JUST THAT SO WE'RE WORKING WITH THE ATTORNEY. OFFICE YOU WERE WERE WORKING CONSCIOUSNESS BUT LAW ENFORCEMENT- TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A PROPOSAL AS WE GO TOWARDS TO THE SENATE. WHICH WEEK THINK CAN BE EMBRACED BY EVERYBODY BECAUSE WE ALL WANT TO YOU KNOW MAKE OUR COMMUNITIES SAFER. AND HAVE FEWER INCIDENCE OF DEADLY FORCE AND I THINK THERE ARE SOME SMART POLICE PRACTICES WITH WHICH WE CAN BRING ABOUT. AND WHAT THAT THE I'D THE NOTION HERE IS WHAT A CITY WHETHER IT SACRAMENTO OR- STOCK DINNER MCFARLAND OR LOS ANGELES. YOU KNOW TEY CAN GO TO ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE AND ASK THEM HEY CAN YOU WORK WITH US TO DO AN AUDIT OF OUR POLICE DEPARTMENT PRACTICES AND COME UP WITH RECOMMENDATIONS. HOW WE CAN- MAKE MAKE OUR COMMUNITIES SAFER BUT ALSO. A PROMOTE PUBLIC SAFETY IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. SO THAT'S WE HAVE HERE BEFORE US AND LET ME PRESENT MY FIRST WITNESS. GOOD MORNING CHEN MEMBERS DENNIS CLOSE TOMORROW WITH THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL AS A ASSEMBLY MEMBER MENTIONED THIS BUILDS ON THE GREAT WORK THAT THE LEGISLATURE DO THE U. OR SPELL. LAST YEAR YEAH REALLY THIS IS UP TO EIGHTY TO YOU KNOW GATHER DATA AND PROVIDE BEST PRACTICES FROM THE FORCE GEN CITIES THAT I TAKE THAT. OPTION THROUGH THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY STRONGLY IN SUPPORT OF THAT WE THINK THAT UP YOU KNOW PROVIDING THAT APPROPRIATE SPACE TO ALLOW THESE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO. GET THIS INDIAN AND A REVIEW OF THEIR YOU SUPPORT THE POLICY A USE OF FORCE POLICIES- WILL. BE BENEFICIAL FOR THE LAW ENFORCEMENT SO WHERE IN STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE SUPPORT BY THE. MARGOT GEORGE FOR THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION WE SUPPORT THE BILL. THANK YOU. DANIEL GOOD TERRACE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEYS FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE ALSO IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. MR KERRY MEMBERS RAINY PERRY WITH ERIN REASSESS ITS OVER HALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION ARBITRON PORAC WERE IN OPPOSITION- WE AGREE WITH THE WORK THAT WAS DONE LAST YEAR WE ALSO TOOK- IN SB TWO THIRTY ONE OF THE OTHER ONE OF THE TO USE OF FORCE BILLS- WE TOOK A LOT OUT OF THAT REPORT IT WAS DONE BY ATTORNEY GENERAL AND PUT IT INTO THE BILL IT IS NOW YOU KNOW I'M STATEWIDE- HOWEVER. THE BILL I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT THIS BILL DOESN'T JUST SAY THE LOCAL AGENCIES CAN GO TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO REVIEW THEIR POLICIES AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS WE ARE OKAY WITH THAT OKAY WITH WHAT SACRAMENTO DID AND THEY WENT TO WE WERE OKAY OUR LOCAL PEEL AWAY SUPPORTED. AND LIKE I SAID WE WORK A LOT OF WHAT CAME OUT A REPORT AND PUT IT IN LEGISLATION THE FIRST PART OF THIS BILL SAYS THAT THE AG SHALL DEVELOP A TASK FORCE. AND IT'S IN THE I THINK CIVIL CODE. SO IT'S IN THE CODE SECTION THAT DEALS- WITH SETTING UP THE CITIZEN. OR I THOUGHT THAT PART WAS IN. IT WAS IT WAS AMENDED BUT THE POINT IS A SET UP A TASK FORCE OF WHICH WE ASSUME IT WILL BE SIMILAR TO THE RIPPER TASK FORCE OR SOMETHING OF THAT. NATURE. I HAVE TO TWO POINTS THAT NUMBER ONE. CALLING IN A TASK FORCE TO PANEL WHO HAS HAS WORKED TO ASSUME THAT THAT TASK FORCE WOULD KNOWN MORE ABOUT LOCAL GOVERNMENT I MEAN NO BUT LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT THAN THE LOCAL LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT FOLKS THEMSELVES WOULD BE QUESTIONABLE SECONDLY. WE HAVE ALWAYS QUESTIONED. THE ISSUE OF WHETHER OR NOT WHY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IS BEING VIEWED BY THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER BY THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL. IS ALWAYS BEING VIEWED AS SOMEONE WHO WOULD KNOW MORE ABOUT LOCAL. LAW ENFORCEMENT REGULATIONS AND POLICIES THEN THE LOCAL AGENCIES THEMSELVES. I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR AND SB TWO THIRTY WHAT WE CREATED WAS SUPPORTED BY BOTH HOUSES WAS A MEASURE THAT WENT WAY FURTHER THAN ANYONE ELSE IN THE COUNTRY ON MANDATORY UNIFORM. POLICIES WOULD HAVE TO BE CREATED. HOWEVER THIS LEGISLATURE ALSO AGREED. THAT WE HAD TO LEAVE ROOM FOR LOCAL AGENCIES TO MAKE THEIR POLICY IS THAT WORK FOR THEIR AGENCY WHAT WORKS IN SAN FRANCISCO OR BERKELEY DOES NOT NECESSARILY WORK. IN OTHER RURAL AREAS OF CALIFORNIA AND I'M NOT TALKING THAT THEY CAN GET AWAY WITH THINGS THAT THEY WOULDN'T WANT TO. I'M TALKING ABOUT JUST WAY THEY HANDLE PUBLIC SAFETY FOR THEIR PEOPLE IN THEIR AREAS AND THAT WAS ALLOWED IN TWO THIRTY AND THAT'S WHAT THE BILL WAS DRAFTED THAT WAY. TO NOW HAVE. BUDDY WHO WE DON'T KNOW THIS IS NOT OUTLINED IN. WE IS SAFE GOING AND STUDY JOSE MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS AND COME UP WITH POLICIES THAT WOULD BE THAT WOULD BE COULD BE COMPLETELY CONTRARY TO WHAT WE JUST DID LAST YEAR THIS TASK FORCE COULD DO THAT THEY COULD COME AND RECOMMEND WE RECOMMEND THAT YOU COMPLETELY CHANGE THE STANDARD. AND THAT WOULD BE PASSED FORCE NOW GOING TO THE LEGISLATURE AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL COMING HERE IN SAN WE RECOMMEND YOU DO ALL THESE CHANGES WHICH WE- DID NOT DO LAST YEAR THAT WE AGREED SHOULD NOT BE DONE. SO THAT'S OUR CONCERN WITH THE BILL AGAIN IF THE INTENT IS TO ALLOW THE AG TO DO WHAT THEY DID IN SACRAMENTO AND THE AUTHORS DISTRICT. WERE OKAY WITH THAT. AND I DON'T KNOW I AND I. BY THE LAW ENFORCEMENT BUT I'VE SPOKEN WITH. WITH OTHER GROUPS WHO ARE NOT HERE TODAY. BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT THE END OF THE AMENDMENTS HAPPENED LAST WEEK SO WE WERE UNAWARE OF SOME OF THE STUFF. BUT JUST SO I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT. THAT. SHARE ARRANGEMENT THE RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION I LIKE THE ACTUAL COMMENTS OF MISTER PERRY AND ALSO POINT OUT THAT IT'S NOT JUST. A TASK FORCE TO. TAKE A LOOK AT. AND BEST PRACTICES OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. IT SAYS IT'S GOING TO REQUIRE THE AG TO DEVELOP A MODEL WRITTEN POLICY. FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK TODAY ABOUT- THIS IS BUILDING ON THREE NINETY TWO OR BUILDING ON TWO THIRTY. WE HAVEN'T EVEN HAD TIME FOR THOSE. STATUTES TO REALLY TAKE AFFECT AND FOR US TO NOW BE- CHANGING THAT AND MAKING OTHER CHANGES THAT- WOULD BURDEN THE AG'S OFFICE. WHO WHEN THEY WEREN'T INVOLVED IN A LOT OF OUR DISCUSSIONS AND NEGOTIATIONS IS PROBLEMATIC FOR US AND- WE THINK THAT IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO ALLOW LOCAL AGENCIES TO BE IN CHARGE OF THEIR OWN POLICIES AS LONG AS THEY COMPORT WITH TWO THIRTY AND THREE NINETY TWO. IN THIS ONE SET UP LIKE I SAID AT A MODEL WRITTEN POLICY FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES BUT THEY'RE ALL DIFFERENT- THE FOR PRO ALLEGIANCE FOR EXAMPLE THEY WEREN'T EVEN INCLUDED IN THREE NINETY TWO OR TWO THIRTY. SO HOW WAS IT EIJI GOING TO HAVE A MODEL. A MODEL FOR THEM AND FOR LOCAL COPS AND LOCAL THAT THE SHERIFFS AND ALL THE DIFFERENT STATE AGENCIES SO- WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT AND WE THINK WE SHOULD LET- SB TWO THIRTY IN AB THREE NINETY TO TAKE EFFECT AND WORK BEFORE WE START ADDING ON TO IT AND SO THE RESEARCHERS SO STATION- IS IT UNFORTUNATELY IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL THIS TIME. OKAY THANK YOU. ANY OTHER ANYONE ELSE PETITION. ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS YES WAS COLORED OF TIME AT THIS I HAVE A QUESTION TO THE CHAIR A MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THIS IS OPTIONAL M. THE LANGUAGE THAT I READING IT SAYS SUBJECT TO AVAILABLE RESOURCES AND THE DISCRETION OF THE A. G. SO MY QUESTIONS ARE A IS THIS IN FACT OPTIONAL AND BE HAS THE AG EVEN INDICATED A WILLINGNESS AND DESIRE TO DO THIS. THAT I DON'T BLUFF GOOD YEAH. THE SECOND QUESTION IS YES WE ARE WORKING WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE THEY THEY WEREN'T READY TO COME TAKE A PUBLIC POSITION TODAY BUT THIS WAS THIS WAS CRAFTED LAST YEAR THIS BILL IS ALMOST IDENTICAL BILL. WITH THEM AND- YOU KNOW WE'RE WORKING IN CONJUNCTION AS FAR AS THE RESOURCES YOU THIS IS A BUDGET ISSUE AS WELL YOU KNOW THEY DID THIS AMAZING REPORT LAST YEAR FOR THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO BUT IT COST A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY AND- WHEN THEY SAID AS WE LOVE TO DO MORE OF THIS. IF WE HAD THE RESOURCES AND SO THAT'S WHY WHAT WE ARE HERE TODAY. THE SETTING UP A FRAMEWORK OF WHAT THIS WOULD LOOK LIKE. IN THE AND WE WILL BE WORKING IN CONJUNCTION AS FAR AS THE- YOUR FIRST POINT QUESTION WAS ABOUT. THE OPTING IN. THAT YOU KNOW HER FAMILY CIRCLE YEAH YEAH THIS YET AND I'M OKAY MAYBE ADDRESS A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT THE OPPOSITION SAID SO I DO CONCUR THEY RAISE UP SOME SOME GOOD- POINTS THAT WE'RE WILLING TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION INTO PREPARATIONS AND IN THE SENATE- I'M VERY OPTIMISTIC SO I HEARD A LOT OF POSITIVE THINGS THERE AS WELL AS SOME CONCERNS- ONE THING THAT I WANT TO DO CLOSE BY IS. IS ABBAS LOOK LIKE WE THOUGHT HERE IN SACRAMENTO WHERE THERE'S A MEETING OF MINDS OF TWO TWO PARTIES YOU KNOW THE YOU KNOW LIKE THAT THE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT JURISDICTION AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE MUTUAL AT TO SAY YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS SOMETHING WE WANT TO LOOK AT OUR POLICIES HERE OUR BEST PRACTICES LOOK AS FAR AS NOT AGGREGATING WHAT'S HAPPENING THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND- IN IN THIS SPACE AND REALLY HELP A LOCAL JURISDICTION WHERE. THERE'S AGREEMENT GOING INTO IT FROM BOTH SIDES. IF YES YEP- OF COURSE HAVE A QUESTION- JUST TO THE OPPOSITION- MISTER PERRY. YOUR MAIN CONCERN AND GUY WAS JUST THE- IT WAS SENT MAINLY- THAT THEY WOULD MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS. OR WHAT EXACTLY IT ARE YOU'RE A MMHM PRECISELY YOUR CONTENT THE FIRST THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER THE FIRST PART OF THE BILL RAINY PAIR OF PORK. AND HAVE CHAU ARE ON THE FIRST PART OF THE BILL A DEAL IS SET TO CREATE A TASK FORCE AND IF YOU READ AND HEAR WHAT IT DOESN'T REQUIRES A TASK FORCE IS NOT JUST RECOMMENDATIONS WAY SO THEY SHOULD THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WITH THE HELP OF THAT TEST FOR SHALL COME UP WITH MODEL POLICY. AND THAT POLICY COULD BE. MANY OF THE THINGS THAT WERE IN THIS LEGISLATURE TO AGREED NOT TO DO LAST YEAR. IT COULD BE EACH COMPLETELY CHANGING THE STANDARD. AT THIS LEGISLATURE DID NOT PASSED LAST YEAR IT COULD BE ANY STANDARD IS DONE BY A TASK FORCE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND ARE CREATING A MALL MODEL POLICY. THAT WOULD COME BACK TO THIS HOUSE. WE HAVE ALREADY DONE WORK IN THIS AREA AND WE'RE ALLOWING LOCALS RIGHT NOW TO CREATE THOSE POLICY. RIGHT BUT IT TO THE MODEL POLICY IT'S NOT REQUIRED THAT ANY LOCAL ANTI T. USE IT SAKARA ACT THE ARREST AND MAKE THE BILL SAYS DEVELOP POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS SO THE WHAT THEY WOULD DO AN ART AND MY UNDERSTANDING. IS TAKEN IN CONSIDERATION BEST PRACTICES WHAT'S WHAT ARE HAPPENING ACROSS THE STATE WE KNOW THAT SAN FRANCISCO AND SEATTLE WERE ALREADY DOING SOME INNOVATIVE WORK ON- ON ON DEADLY FORCE AND PREVENT AND PREVENTION. AND THEN LOOKING AT THAT LOOKING AT THE NEW POLICIES COMING FORTH WITH. AT TWO THIRTY AND THREE NINE TWO AND COMING UP WITH KIND OF LIKE A BLUEPRINT OF HOW CITIES COULD EVOLVE IN THIS SPACE AND EVEN MORE SO THAT THAT THAT THE REST OF THIS IS THAT. MAYBE CITIES EITHER WE HAVE CITIES ALL TYLER THAT ARE COME UP AND SAY YOU KNOW WHAT MAYBE WE'RE MISSING SOMETHING AND SO THEY COULD GO TO THE- ATTORNEY GENERAL. IT'S OFFICE AND ASK THEM TO DO AN AUDIT AND ASSESSMENT OF THEIR EXACT BACK THIS IS HAPPENED HERE IN THE CITY'S ACKERMAN ON THEY FOUND. MULTIPLE THINGS THAT THAT THAT THAT THEY MAKE CHANGES AND I WOULD SAY THAT MAYES THINGS WERE EMBRACED BY OUR LOCAL. POLICE IN AS WELL SO WASN'T ALWAYS ADVERSARIAL. ALL RIGHT SO I DON'T SEE ANYTHING MANDATORY- ABOUT THIS IN THE SENSE THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO. LOOK WE WERE VERY CAREFUL AND IN FACT I IN THIS COMMITTEE WHEN WE DID OUR LEFT THE- LET THE BILL GO FORWARD WE SAID SPECIFICALLY THAT THERE HAVE TO BE CHANGES. AND THERE WERE CHANGES AND I DON'T THINK THAT WE WOULD JUST HAVE LONG ARM ADOPT. ADOPT A RECOMMENDATION BECAUSE IT'S MADE BY THIS TASK FORCE SO I THINK THEY'RE SUFFICIENT- CLARITY HERE- BUT AGAIN IF THE AUTHOR WILL WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION AS HE SAID- PERHAPS WE CAN MAKE THAT EVEN MORE CLEAR THANK YOU. I HAVE SOME SELECTIONS FIRST OF ALL. I THINK THAT THIS IS VERY TROUBLING AS IT STANDS RIGHT NOW THERE'S JUST A LOT MORE QUESTIONS AND THERE ARE CLARIFICATIONS FIRST OF ALL. IF I CAN ASK YOUR- BECAUSE IT'S VERY VERY VAGUE. WHO'S GONNA BE ON THIS TASK FORCE. YEAH. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE CAME UP WITH THESE RECOMMENDATIONS LAST YEAR WHEN THEY WANTED TO LOOK AT THEIR BEST PRACTICES SO THEY WOULD BRING IN LAW ENFORCEMENT THEY WOULD BRING IN YOU KNOW POLICY EXPERTS THEY WOULD BRING IN- ACADEMICS- THEIR OWN DIVISION AND THAT'S WE HAVE ASSURANCES TOLD THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE A BALANCE TASK FORCE BECAUSE WHAT WHAT WHAT MY FEAR IS THERE IS A WILL HAVE PEOPLE. THAT AREN'T UNDERSTANDING THE ACTUAL TRAINING THE GOES AND ALL THE PARAMETERS THAT. LAW ENFORCEMENT ARE TAUGHT AND THAT'S INTEGRATED IN THEIR TRAINING. AND I THINK THAT THAT THAT CREATES A PROBLEM AND SECONDLY. I GET THE IMPRESSION AND I DON'T SAY THAT THAT'S IT YOUR INTENT BUT THIS COULD BE. CONSIDERED ANOTHER BITE OF THE APPLE YOU YOU ACTUALLY ON A VERY VERY DELICATE. AND IT WAS A HUGE ACCOMPLISHMENT TO ACTUALLY GET AB THREE NINETY TWO NSP TWO THIRTY- IN A BIPARTISAN SUPPORT AND EVERYBODY- CAME TOGETHER ON A VERY VERY SENSITIVE VERY DELICATE ISSUE AND I THINK THAT THIS IS. A RE OPENING. A VERY VERY- DIFFICULT SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES BEFORE WE EVEN HAVE A CHANCE TO IMPLEMENT THREE NIGHT TWO INTO THIRTY. BECAUSE IT WHEN YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TASK FORCE AND THE REVIEW THEIR SEPARATE. RIGHT AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT REALLY NEEDS TO BE CLARIFIED. OF. THE TASK FORCE IS NOT OPTIONAL. IT'S MANDATORY AND THE REVIEW IS OPTIONAL AND I'VE I THINK THAT THIS IS A VERY VERY DANGEROUS GROUND AND IT PUTS THOSE OF US WHO. ARE TRYING TO CREATE BALANCE AND A VERY VERY. DELICATE VERY DELICATE DISCUSSION POINT AND I RESPECT BOTH SIDES OF THIS AND OF COURSE I LEAN OF ARE PROBABLY IN ANOTHER. CATEGORY THAN MANY PEOPLE BECAUSE I'VE ACTUALLY. BEEN ON THE OTHER SIDE SO BUT I THINK WE REALLY NEED TO BUILD. AND NOT. STIRRED UP AGAIN AND I THINK OF THIS AS A STRONG POTENTIAL TO DO THAT VERY THING AND I DON'T THINK THAT YOUR INTENT NOW AND BUT BUT BUT I JUST HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT I'M VERY VERY CONCERNED. AND MAYBE MAC ADDRESS YOUR YOUR QUESTIONS INCLUDES THOSE WITH THREE WAYS- NUMBER ONE THEY ARE TWENTY GENERAL'S THE TOP COP OF CALIFORNIA YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S HOW WE THAT'S HOW WE DO THIS INDIVIDUAL IT'S A LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY. IT'S NOT- YOU KNOW A CITIZEN APPOINTED TASK FORCE OF MONDAY MORNING QUARTERBACKS WHO HAVE THEORIES BUT AREN'T INVOLVED IN THE DAY TO DAY PRACTICE. NUMBER I'M MORE THAN WILL WILLING AS WE MOVE ALONG TO CLARIFY WHAT THIS ENTITY SHOULD LOOK LIKE IN CONJUNCTION WITH. THE ROCKS AND THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE IN A- POSITION. SAY THEY DID. THE MANY PART OF THIS WITH. THE SACRAMENTO ABOUT IT IN A TALK ABOUT HERE WITH. THE TASK FORCE THAT THEY CREATED HERE. BUT YOU KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE PEOPLE THAT SERVED ON PRESIDENT OBAMA'S TASK FORCE ON THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY POLICING- THE POLICE CHIEFS FROM WATCHING TO SEE IN PHILADELPHIA- YOU KNOW THE- THE- THIS THE FORMER SENIOR COUNSEL CHIEF COUNSEL WITH THE LOOKS LIKE THAT. THE UNION FROM. ILLINOIS ON THIS ISSUE AS WELL SO. THE INDIVIDUALS TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS WAR I THINK PEOPLE. THE WITH WHAT YOU'RE ASKING WORK. IN A DAY TO DAY OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND NOT. YOU KNOW PEOPLE COMING FROM FROM THE OUTSIDE SO- AND AGAIN AS WE MOVE FORWARD I WILL. WORK WITH THE WITH THE OPPOSITION TO DECLARE HI YOU KNOW WHO THE PARTIES WILL BE. OKAY JUST SO YOU KNOW ALTHOUGH AT THIS POINT IT'S TOO BIG FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THAT CAN TRAIN LIKE IT THAT. FAIR ENOUGH. MR QUIRK IN BRIEFLY I THINK YOU MAY BE ABLE TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION IF YOU SPECIFICALLY SAY THAT THE MODEL POLICY MUST BE CONSISTENT WITH EXISTING LAW AND YOU MAY WANT TO ALSO ADD THAT FOR THE RECOMMENDATIONS- I WILL LEAVE THAT FOR YOU TO CONSIDER. GOOD SUGGESTIONS. BUT JONES. OKAY ANY OTHER QUESTIONS YOU MAY CLOSE. THE NET I APPRECIATE THAT THE CONVERSATION AND SOME OF THE SUGGESTIONS WE WILL TAKE THAT FORD AND OUR GOAL THIS IS NOT TO BE AN ADVERSARIAL POLICY BUT TO BUILD UPON- THE GOOD WORK FROM LAST YEAR AND TO HELP COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA IMPLEMENT THAT AND LOOK AT OTHER. PRACTICES IN LAW ENFORCEMENT THEY COULD THEY COULD HELP YOU KNOW BRING ABOUT MORE PUBLIC TRUST TO COMMUNITIES AND BRING ABOUT A SMARTER POLICING OUT PRACTICES AND WITH THAT ASK THE RIGHT VOTE THANK YOU COULD- COULD I ASK MR PERIOD TO COME UP. UP SO THERE'S A COUPLE OF THINGS I'VE HEARD- AS IT PERTAINS TO TRYING TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR. OF WHAT MR QUIRK RECOMMENDED IS THAT SOMETHING YOUR ORGANIZATIONS. WOULD BE. INTERESTED IN LOOKING AT IN WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR. WE I SAID OKAY I'M NOT TRYING TO COME IN ON OKAY. WE MET OUTSIDE AND SPOKE OUR BIGGEST CONCERN IS THE TASK FORCE BUT WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE ATTORNEY ONE AT A TIME TO START WITH. THAT AND THEY WOULD TALK. EGGMAN NATIONS AS THEY COME OUT. COULD YOU REPEAT WHAT YOU JUST. YES IF PHAM. FOR BOTH SIDES TO CONSIDER OF THAT CERTAINLY THE MODEL POLICY REFLECT CURRENT LAW AND- PERHAPS THE RECOMMENDATIONS AS WELL REFLECTS CURRENT LAW AS OPPOSED TO GOING BEYOND CURRENT LAW- IF THAT WERE THERE THAT WOULD CERTAINLY- I HOPE BELIEVE SOME OF YOUR CONCERNS THAT CAN THAT'S UP TO YOU IN THE AUTHOR TO WORK OUT. YES THAT'S ONCE. THERE'S ANOTHER STEP ABOUT THE TASK FORCE AND. BUT THE MISTER LACKEY EXPRESSED SOME CONCERN ANDWHAT THAT. OR COULD LOOK LIKE WOULD LOOK LIKE BUSH SHOULD LOOK LIKE IF WE WERE TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. DO YOU WANT TO BE ENGAGED IN THAT HAVE DISCOVERED A WAY OF. THANK YOU. AND THEN FOR THE AUTHOR I'VE TRIED TO GET. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SEVERAL TIMES. TO DO CERTAIN THINGS AND HIS. IS RESPONSE TO ME IS I WILL DO IT. IF YOU FUNDED GROUP I WASN'T ABLE TO FIND IT SO HE DIDN'T DO IT. IF IT GETS OUT HIS COMMITTEE AND IT GOES TO A PROCS. I WOULD IMAGINE IT WOULD NOT MAKE OUT OF APPROACH IF WE CANNOT FUNDED. AND YOU'RE GONNA NEED THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. THIS ROUTE OF THE PART THAT WAS VERY DIFFICULT FOR ME TO GET SOMETHING DONE. TO SAY THAT HE WILL WHOLEHEARTEDLY EMBRACE. AND IF YOU CAN GET THOSE TWO THINGS IT WILL NOT GET OUT OF. APPROPRIATIONS I CAN ALMOST. GUARANTEE THAT IT IT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT OR IF YOU GET TO THE FLOOR THAT WILL BE A MAJOR CONCERN FUNDING AND IF YOU CAN'T BE FUNDED IN THE END OR HE DOESN'T WANT TO DO IT. OR HE'S- RETICENT TO DO IT IT BECOMES VERY DIFFICULT EVEN THOUGH HE'S THE TOP COP. IT COULD BE VERY VERY DIFFICULT TO MOVE THIS FORWARD AND- I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THAT AND VERY CONCERNED. AND SO YOU HAVE. ONE HURDLE. AT LEAST WORKING OUT SOME LANGUAGE WHICH I THINK. THE OPPOSITION AMENABLE TO- BUT UNFORTUNATELY I THINK YOU'RE HIGH HER. HURDLE IS THE FUNDING AND SO- YOU NEED TO GET WORK ON BOTH OF THOSE AT THE SAME TIME AND THEN ANY OTHER AMBIGUITY. IF BOTH SIDES WILL. AT LEAST BRING IT UP- I HADN'T HEARD I MEAN IN OPPOSITION HAD COME TO MY OFFICE AND TALK TO ME AND SO ON IN SOME WAYS I'M HEARING THIS FOR THE FIRST TIME. AND SO. I'M GOING TO HELP YOU GET IT OUT A HUGE HOLE FOR GET OUT OF HERE. BUT AFTER THAT I REALLY NEED YOU TO. TO WORK TO THE FIRM THIS UP AND GET SOME- DEFINITIVE NUMBERS AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE SO THAT. THE BILL. AS YOU'RE SAYING AS WHAT MR LACKEY WOULD HOPE. THAT WE ALL WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE THIS SOMETHING THAT WILL HELP WHAT EVERYBODY. WE SWEATED WE BLED A LOT FOR THESE BILLS. OUR STATE AGAIN WE BLED A LOT TO GET THOSE BILLS OUT. AND WE DON'T WANT ANYTHING TO UNDERMINE THAT AN ARTIST AND DID EVERYTHING FOR ME COMING FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT LOCAL CONTROL I THINK THERE'S AN UNDERSTANDING THAT. THESE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT DON'T HAVE TO ADD ON OF WE NEED TO CONFIRM THAT UP TO. GET DON'T HAVE TO BE. I THOUGHT YOU WERE TRYING TO GET. SOMETHING WHERE LOCAL GOVERNMENT COULD I THINK THIS WHERE TO START IT YOUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT DID NOT DOES NOT. DO THINGS THAT YOU THOUGHT WERE APPROPRIATE ROUTE BUT IF THIS IS. SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE CAN DO. IF THEY CAN MAKE A DECISION THEY WANT TO DO IT IF YOU'RE MEMBERS DECIDE THEY WANT TO DO IT FINE IF THEY DON'T WANT TO DO IS FIND IN. IS THERE SOME CLARIFYING LANGUAGE. BECAUSE I THINK THAT THAT'S PART OF IT SO WE- I KNOW THAT I KEEP A LOT OF STUFF. ON THERE THAT YOU NEED TO DO- BUT HOPEFULLY IN A SHORT PERIOD TIME IS YOU GOTTA GET TO APPROACH YOU CAN YOU CAN WEAVE THROUGH A LOT OF THAT. CONTRACT MMHM. DO WE HAVE A MOTION. WITH THE. ON A. B. EIGHT FIVE FIVE THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER CHEN SWEAR I LACKEY LACKEY NOPE BAUER-KAHAN DEEP. KAMLAGER. KAMLAGER HI QUIRK QUIRK I SANTIAGO WICKS WICKS I. THE BILLS ARE CALLED NEED ONE MORE YEAH. YES. MR LACKEY. AB FOURTEEN FIFTY. YOU MAKE MONEY HE'S ONLY. ALL RIGHT WILL HELP WE MR LACKEY WILL BE DEALING TESTIFYING TODAY ON HIS BILL. ON THE AMENDMENTS. BUT I'D BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T SAY HAPPY BIRTHDAY MOON AND- EVERYBODY ELSE DID NOT. IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE ALSO THAT I ALSO RECOGNIZE THE FACT IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY AND YOU DESERVED CELEBRATE. THIS IS A BIG DEAL TO ME. AND I WANT TO BEGIN BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE STAFFER ACTUALLY GENERALLY WORKING WITH US ON THIS PARTICULAR MATTER. BECAUSE I BELIEVE IT IS A SUITABLE SOLUTION TO A PROBLEM THAT PLAGUES THE PSYCHE OF COMMUNITIES MY DISTRICT HEAVILY. THIS LEGISLATION RESTORES LAW ENFORCEMENT'S ABILITY TO ENTER DATA. INTO WHAT IS CALLED THE CHILD ABUSE. CENTRAL INDEX OTHERWISE KNOWN AS KHAKI. IF FURTHER DEVELOPS A GRIEVANCE PROCESS FOR AGREE PARTIES THAT WISH TO BE REMOVED FROM THE DATABASE. FOLLOWING THE DEATH OF GABRIEL FERNANDES NOR QUATTRO ANTHONY AVALOS THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION ON CHILD PROTECT. I'M SORRY CHILD PROTECTION RECOMMENDED TO INCREASE THE COOPERATION BETWEEN DCFS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT. THIS LEGISLATION WOULD AFFORD INDIVIDUALS ACCESSING WHAT COULD BE A DANGEROUS SITUATION WITH THE WIDEST PERSPECTIVE POSSIBLE. PART OF THE PROBLEM THAT HAPPENED AND THESE OTHER TRAGEDIES IS THAT WE HAVE AGENCIES. THAT I JUST MENTIONED WORKING WITH IN SILOS INSTEAD OF COLLABORATION. AB FOURTEEN FIFTY ESTABLISHES A GRIEVANCE PROCESS CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH HOWARD DSS HERE'S COMPLAINTS SO IF YOU'RE YOU'RE IN THE SYSTEM AND YOU FEEL LIKE IT'S UNFAIR THERE IS A GRIEVANCE PROCESS THAT'S BUILT BUILT WITHIN THE US LED PROPOSED LEGISLATION. THIS LEGISLATION IS A STEP FORWARD IN ESTABLISHING A WORKING SYSTEM. THE FORMER DATABASE PROVIDED. I'M SORRY PROVED TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS AND ISSUES WHICH WERE HOPING TO ADDRESS RATHER THAN RESTRICT. THE CAPABILITIES OF OUR PEACEMAKERS. THIS BILL ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE STATUS QUO CREATED A CRACK. FOR THE SENSITIVE CASES TO FALL THROUGH. AND ALTHOUGH IT'S DIFFICULT TO SAY THAT THIS LEGISLATURE ELIMINATE THE CRACKS IN IT I DO BELIEVE THAT IT WILL LIMIT THE LIKELIHOOD OF THE TRAGEDIES THAT HAVE LED TO THE DEATH OF GABRIEL ANTHONY CANNELLA. AND I WOULD ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT ON THIS LEGISLATION. VERY GOOD THANK YOU I AM TEMPORARILY. THE CHAIR HERE.
