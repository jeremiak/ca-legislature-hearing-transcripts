APOLOGIES FOR THE BRIEF INTERRUPTION. AT AN EGG HELLO MR AGAIN THAT COVERED NINETEEN HAS UPENDED ALL OF OUR LIVES BUT IT IMPACTS HAVE BEEN FELT MORE ACUTELY IN THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY MANY OF US ARE FOR THE NUMBERS. PREPARED DAMMIT CALIFORNIA PLAYED ONE POINT FOUR MILLION RESTAURANT WORKERS BY MARCH TWENTY TWENTY AT LEAST NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND OF THESE WORKERS HAVE BEEN LAID OFF OR FURLOUGHED. NATIONALLY THE INDUSTRY COLLECTIVELY LOST TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY BILLION DOLLARS IN SALES LAST YEAR. RESTAURANTS ARE A CRITICAL SECTOR OF CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY IN TWENTY NINETEEN ALONE RESTAURANT FOOD SERVICE JOBS TOTAL 11% OF EMPLOYMENT IN THE STATE EVERY DOLLAR SPENT THE INDUSTRY CONTRIBUTES ANYWHERE FROM ONE DOLLAR SEVENTY FIVE TO TWO DOLLARS TO THE STATE ECONOMY. RESTAURANTS GENERATE MORE SALES TAX IN CALIFORNIA THAN ANY OTHER TYPE OF BUSINESS IN THE LAST YEAR BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC CALIFORNIA RESTAURANTS HAVE ONLY BEEN ALLOWED TO OPERATE IN STRICTLY LIMITED WAGE. IN DOING SO THEY HAVE DISPROPORTIONATELY INCREASED SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC LOSSES TO THEIR BUSINESSES THEIR WORKFORCE AND OUR COMMUNITIES THE FEDERAL PAYCHECK PROTECTION PROGRAM WELL IMPLEMENTED QUICKLY- AND HASTILY TO CUT HELP COVER PAYROLL COSTS. AS WELL AS MENTIONED THE CURRENT FEDERAL RESTAURANT REVITALIZATION FUND HAVE BEEN IMPORTANT LIFELINES FOR THE INDUSTRY ESPECIALLY WHEN COMBINED WITH ACTIONS THAT WE'VE TAKEN AT THE STATE LEVEL TO PROVIDE RELIEF. WERE FORTUNATE TO HAVE THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE CONTROL HERE WITH US TODAY DESCRIBED TO DESCRIBE SOME OF THOSE RELIEF MEASURES IN MORE DETAIL LATER ON IN THE PROGRAM. AMID THE EARLY CHAOS OF COVE IN NINETEEN THE RESTAURANTS THAT MANAGED TO STAY AFLOAT ADAPTED BECAUSE THEY HAD TO NOW AFTER MONTHS OF REDUCING THEIR OPERATIONS TO DELIVERY TAKE OUT AND LIMITED OUTDOOR DINING MANY RESTAURANTS HAVE MOVED INTO A DINING. ALBEIT WITH CAPACITY LIMITS AS THE STATE'S KOBE CASE NUMBERS HAVE STABILIZED VACCINE EFFORTS OF ROLLED OUT IN MOORE COUNTY SHOULD BE GOING TO OPEN UP AGAIN. RESTAURANTS HAVE WORKED HARD TO REOPEN SAFELY AND INSTITUTED A HOST OF SAFETY AND SANITATION MEASURES TO KEEP CUSTOMERS AND STAFF SAFE TODAY WILL BE HERE FROM A VARIETY OF OPERATORS IS TO SHARE HOW THEY'VE ADAPTED THEIR BUSINESS MODELS TO RESPOND. IT IS CLEAR THE RECOVERY WILL TAKE AS MORE AND MORE PEOPLE GET. BECOME MORE. RETURNING TO PRE PANDEMIC DINING. AFTER TODAY'S HEARING WE HOPE TO HAVE A BETTER SENSE. OF WHAT THE INDUSTRY WILL LOOK LIKE IN THE FUTURE WHAT THE STATE CAN AND SHOULD. DO TO HELP RESTAURANTS BUILD BACK BETTER. AND WHAT CUSTOMERS CAN EXPECT IS A STATE LOOKS TO REOPEN MORE FULLY ON JUNE FIFTEENTH. BEFORE I BEGIN BEGIN WHETHER SPEAKERS I'D LIKE TO INVITE THE PUBLIC WANTED TO SPEAK TO CALL AND NOW. PLEASE DIAL THIS TOLL FREE NUMBER EIGHT SEVEN SEVEN TWO TWO SIX. EIGHT ONE FIVE TWO WHEN PROMPTED PLEASE USE THIS ACCESS CODE. EIGHT ONE EIGHT TWO EIGHT ONE SEVEN- AND WITH THAT THE AND ALSO FOR MY VICE CHAIR SENATOR BATES THE OPPORTUNITY. FOR SOME OF THE COMMENTS AS WELL. WELL THANK YOU ARE CHAIRMAN. I KNEW WHEN I PRECIADO- THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE WITH YOU AND I WANT TO GIVE YOU A HIGH FIVE I THINK THE WAY YOU'VE SET UP THE COMMITTEE HEARING TODAY AND THE PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PANELS IS ABSOLUTELY EXCELLENT- THE BRIEFING PAPER THAT WE WERE PROVIDED JOBS I THINK ONE SENTENCE AND IT SAYS THAT ALL IT'S IN THE INTRODUCTION FEW SECTORS. HAVE BEEN BATTERED MORE BY THE COVE IN NINETEEN PANDEMIC IN THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY THAT GOES WITHOUT SAYING BUT IT NEEDED TO BE SAD SO THAT OUR CHAIRMAN COULD PUT TOGETHER A GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS ON THESE PANELS WHO HAVE HAD A LITTLE PIECE OF THE WHOLE THING OF HAVING TO DO THE OVERSIGHT. IMPOSED THE RESTRICTIONS AND DAN ARE RESTAURATEURS WHO'VE HAD TO BEAR THROUGH- A YEAR AND A HALF OF SOME VERY VERY SERIOUS SITUATIONS IN TERMS OF EMPLOYMENT KEEPING THEIR BUSINESSES OPEN SO THIS IS A VERY VERY IMPORTANT DAY AND AN EXCEPTIONAL DAY AGAIN THINKING THE CHAIR OFF FOR PROVIDING THEIR FAN PROBABLY I THINK WE ARE PUSHING IT A LITTLE EARLIER US SENATOR NEWMAN ABOUT DOING IT BUT I THINK ALL THIS HAS BEEN ON A VERY OPPORTUNE TIME. BECAUSE WE ARE SEEING A LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL AND- WHAT HOW WE GO FORWARD SO WE MIGHT AVOID THE PITFALLS IN THE FUTURE AND HELP FROM THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE RAMPED UP VERY QUICKLY AND I MIGHT SAY. I SEE IT HAPPENING BECAUSE IT'S DIFFICULT FILE ON THE WEEKEND STARTING ON FRIDAY TO GET A RESERVATION- THAT SOME RESTAURANTS BECAUSE THEY'RE. ALREADY BOOKED SO IT SHOWS THAT THE PUBLIC. HAS BEEN ANXIOUSLY A ALL OF. THIS LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL IN GETTING THIS VERY VERY IMPORTANT INDUSTRY UP AND RUNNING WHICH PROVIDES US SO MUCH. IN ADDITION TO THE REVENUES THE OPPORTUNITY TO ENJOY FRIENDS AND FAMILY. IN A WONDERFUL SETTING SO. WITHOUT TERM LIMITS SO LET'S GET GOING. I THANK YOU CELEBRATION I GOT FOR THE OPPORTUNITY ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF PANEL WHICH MAKE AN OPENING STATEMENT. I APPRECIATE THAT SO WHAT WE AS WE GET INTO THE FIRST PAEL I WANT I WANT TO INVITE. ALL OF THE- OTHER TWO PARTICIPANTS AND ASSEMBLYWOMAN URBAN. GUIDE TO IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS PLEASE JUST LET ME KNOW. AND LIKE TO KEEP THIS IS INTERACTIVE. AND PARTICIPATORY AS POSSIBLE- BUT NOW LET'S FIRST. TURN TO THE FIRST PANEL TO PROVIDE A LOOK BACK AT THE EARLY STAGES OF THE PANDEMIC IT'S RESTAURANTS OF ALL KINDS ACROSS THE STATE. WERE REQUIRED TO INSTITUTE A NUMBERS OF ALL THE EMERGENCY MEASURES DIRECTED BY THE STATE. OUR FIRST PANELIST WILL BE DR MATT WILLIS THE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER OF MARIN COUNTY REMEMBER THE STATEWIDE HEALTH OFFICERS ASSOCIATION. DR WILLIS RELIES ON HIS EXPERIENCE AS A PHYSICIAN AND EPIDEMIOLOGIST AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS. TO GUIDE PUBLIC HEALTH STRATEGY FOR MARIN COUNTY. HE'S HERE TODAY SHARES EXPERIENCES WITH COMMUNICATING IMPLEMENTING AND ENFORCING PANDEMIC RELATED POLICIES. ON THE GROUND WELCOME DOCTOR WILLIS. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON COMMITTEE MEMBERS- THANKS FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO OFFER MY PERSPECTIVE AS A LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER- IN WHAT HAS BEEN- YOU KNOW A VERY CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT FOR US- IN OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH WITH OUR COMMUNITY IN TERMS OF. REGULATIONS IN AN ENVIRONMENT OF A NOVEL VIRUS THAT. WE WERE- AT EVERY STAGE GAINING MORE AND MORE KNOWLEDGE OF THE BEHAVIOR THIS VIRUS WHAT STRATEGIES WOULD BE MOST EFFECTIVE. AND HAVING TO WORK WITH. WITH INDUSTRY. TO CONTINUOUSLY MODIFY AN ADAPTER PRACTICES SO. I SURE- YOU KNOW YOU YOUR SENSE THAT THIS IS THE BEST APPROACH TO. INTERACTIVELY AND BY DIRECTIONALLY AND THAT'S ONE OF THE I THINK ONE OF THE MESSAGES I WANT TO OFFER. RIGHT OFF THE BAT IS THAT- IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW TO DO THIS BETTER THE NEXT TIME I THINK THE EXPECTATION THAT THIS BE DONE- IN DIALOGUE- AND WITH CLEAR AND OPEN AND TRANSPARENT COMMUNICATION BETWEEN PUBLIC HEALTH. AND ANY SECTOR THAT'S IMPORTANT ACTED. BY PUBLIC HEALTH PRACTICE. NEEDS TO BE CORE TO OUR STRATEGY. I'M I'M GOING TO. SOME OF SOME OF THE WAY WE APPROACH THAT IN MARIN COUNTY SOME TAKING UP A LOCAL FOCUS AS LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER BUT THAT'S ALSO MY WAY OF. OF SUGGESTING WHAT I THINK SOME OF THE SOME OF THE BEST PRACTICES MIGHT BE- MOVING FORWARD AND ALSO SOME OF THE CHALLENGES- AND SHORTCOMINGS THAT WE EXPERIENCED HERE IN MARIN- AND HOW THAT MIGHT BE. BUILT INTO SOMETHING YOU COULD DO BETTER THE NEXT TIME. SO I WOULD MORGAN WAS AMONG. THOSE SIX COUNTIES THAT- A DOCTOR THE VERY FIRST SHELTER IN PLACE POLICY ON MARCH SIXTEENTH OF TWENTY TWENTY- THAT WAS IN RESPONSE TO WHAT AT THAT TIME WAS EXPONENTIAL GROWTH IN CASES PRIMARILY EMANATING OUT OF THE- SOUTHERN BAY AREA. SANTA CLARA- AND IT WAS IT WAS CLEAR- AS WE ARE DEVELOPING EVEN JUST DEVELOPING THOSE THAT SHELTER IN PLACE POLICY THAT IT IS ONE THING TO TRY AND ORGANIZE SOCIETY. AROUND YOU KNOW PREVENTING. ACCESS TRANSMISSION IN THE SETTING OF A AN EMERGING PANDEMIC- AS THEY OCCUR AS PEOPLE INTERACT ACROSS THE COMMUNITY. IT IS ANOTHER THING TO HAVE THE SPECIFIC AWARENESS OF EVERY INDUSTRY OUT OF EVERY BUSINESS TO BE ABLE TO OFFER THEM THE SPECIFICITY OF GUIDANCE FOR THEIR PARTICULAR SETTING AND SO WE RECOGNIZE RIGHT OFF THE BAT THAT THERE WAS GOING TO NEED TO BE A SERIES OF CONVERSATIONS THAT WOULD FOLLOW. THAT INITIAL SHELTER IN PLACE THAT WOULD HELP EVERY INDUSTRY IMPLEMENTED EFFECTIVELY- AND SO OUT OF THAT YOU KNOW WHAT I WAS LOOKING BACK AT AT THE PRESS RELEASE THAT WAS RELEASED FOR THIS FOR SHELTER IN PLACE. I WAS REMINDED THAT WE CAN FRAME IT AS A THREE WEEK SHELTER IN PLACE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW PUTTING ON THE BRAKES FOR THREE WEEKS TO TRY AND- GET A GET A- HANDLE ON WHAT WAS EXPONENTIAL GROWTH OF THAT TIME. YOUR LITTLE DID WE KNOW THAT MORE THAN A YEAR LATER WE'RE STILL OPERATING IN THIS FRAMEWORK THAT FORTUNATELY WE'RE LOOKING AT. SOME SETTING ON ON JUNE FIFTEENTH AND I THINK WE'RE IN A GOOD PLACE FOR REACHING THE BENCHMARK FOR THAT DAY AS THE END OF THIS OF THE SHELTER IN PLACE FOR THE END OF THE BLUEPRINT- SO. IN MARIN. IN APRIL. SO JUST A COUPLE WEEKS AFTER WE INITIATED THE CENTER FOR SHELTER PLACE WE ESTABLISHED A GROUP CALLED MARIN RECOVERS. WHICH WAS AN EFFORT FOR PUBLIC HEALTH. TO WORK WITH INDUSTRY LEADERS ACROSS ALL DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES. IN BURN CALORIES SO RESTAURANTS. INSTRUCTION BASED BASED ORGANIZATIONS RETAIL ETCETERA- AND HAD LEADERS FROM THOSE INDUSTRIES ACTUALLY MEET WITH PUBLIC HEALTH ON A WEEKLY BASIS. TO WORK OUT WHAT WOULD BE THE BEST PROCESS AS WE LEARNED ABOUT THE VIRUS. AND AS WE LEARN WHAT THE IMPACT WAS. ON THOSE SECTORS TO TRY AND HAVE. YOU KNOW I GET A BI DIRECTIONAL AND TRANSPARENT CONVERSATION- SO I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE ONE OF THE- BEST OF THE BEST PRACTICES. PERHAPS THIS IS INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT ALLOWS INDUSTRY. TO WORK WITH PUBLIC HEALTH DIRECTLY. AND INDIRECTLY- THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS. GROUNDED IN- WHAT WE WHAT WE IN RANDOM MATRIX WAS SET WHICH WAS THE WORLD HEALTH. ORGANIZATION DEFINITION OF HEALTH. WHICH IS- A COMPLETE STATE OF PHYSICAL SOCIAL AND MENTAL WELL BEING AND NOT MERELY THE ABSENCE OF DISEASE. AND SO WE'RE TALK ABOUT SOCIAL WELL BEING AS BEING INTRINSIC TO HEALTH IT REALLY OPENS THE DOOR FOR RECOGNIZING THE ECONOMIC HEALTH AND ECONOMIC WELL BEING ARE ALSO PART OF HEALTH. AND NOT MERELY ORGANIZING EVERYTHING AROUND EXPLICITLY JUST PREVENTING ANY PREVENTABLE ACTIVE OF TRANSMISSION OF COVERT NINETEEN BECAUSE WE KNOW THE WAY TO ACCOMPLISH THAT WOULD BE REALLY SIMPLY TO HAVE EVERYONE. BE AT HOME CONSTANTLY NOT INTERACTING AT ALL AND WE KNEW THAT THAT WAS NOT FEASIBLE FROM AN ECONOMIC OR SOCIAL STANDPOINT- SO JUST SOME OF THE MECHANICS OF THAT MARIN RECOVERS GROUP WEEKLY MEETINGS. INDUSTRY INDUSTRY ADVISORS IN MARIN COUNTY THAT INDUSTRY ADVISE THAT WAS CHOSEN FOR THE RESTAURANT REQUEST WAS ARMED BY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES DIRECTOR NOW YOU'LL HEAR FROM ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES SHORTLY IN. ANOTHER PANELIST. THAT WAS SO IT'S PROBABLY HEALTH. HEALTH AND THEN AN INDUSTRY LEADER FROM WITHIN THE RESTAURANT SECTOR- AND THEY REPRESENTED THAT SECTOR AS A WHOLE AND WE'RE ABLE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS- AT ON AN AD HOC BASIS SOMETIMES AS RECOMMENDATIONS CHANGED. OR ON REGULAR BASIS WEEKLY MEETINGS- WE ALSO HAD MEMBERS OF CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE WERE PART OF THAT GROUP FUNCTIONS- RIGHT AS FORTUNATE AS A MEDIUM SIZE COUNTY SOURCE MONMOUTH COUNTY TO HAVE THOSE. SOME RELATIONSHIPS WITH THOSE THE WORDS THAT ARE IMPACTED BY OUR POLICIES- CHAMBERS OF ALL THE CHAMBER. ELEVEN ALONG WITH MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS AND THE BRANCH MANAGERS A STATEMENT MANAGERS AS WELL- SOME OF THE OUTCOMES OF THAT PROCESS WAS- BEFORE THE STATE DEVELOPED WHEN WE HAD US A SITE SPECIFIC PROTECTION PLAN FOR MARIN COUNTY. WHERE ALL THE BUSINESSES WERE ABLE TO GO THROUGH KIND OF A TEMPLATE AND SAY OKAY THIS IS HOW WE'RE GOING TO ACCOMPLISH THIS GOAL DISTANCING THIS IS HOW WE'RE GOING TO ACCOMPLISH PERSONAL COVERAGE YOU KNOW ALL THE DIFFERENT ELEMENTS OF SAFETY- WE'RE ALSO ABLE TO PARTNER WITH THEM. IN IN PREVENTING OUTBREAKS THAT WOULD CLOSE RESTAURANTS- YOU KNOW WHEN SPACE FOR US WE HELP THEM- CONTROL SPREAD WE HELP THEM ACTUALLY GET WITH THE TESTING THEY NEED IN ORDER TO PREVENT. HAVING TO CLOSE THE BUSINESS THERE'S AN OTBREAK AND THE STAFF. YEAH WE KNOW THAT THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY YOU ARE NOT NOT ABLE TO GET. HAVE ENOUGH STAFF TO KEEP THE BUSINESS OPEN. SO WE WERE ABLE TO- PARTNER WITH AND MOVE MOBILE TESTING OPTIONS AND OTHERS. OUT TO RESTAURANTS. OR OR HAVE DAYS WHERE ALL THE RESTAURANTS WERE ABLE TO SEND THEIR EMPLOYEES FOR TESTING- GREW OUT OF THAT NEEDS YOU KNOW DETERMINED IN THAT BRAIN RECOVER SCREW- ANOTHER STRENGTH WAS- NAVIGATING. STATE RECOMMENDATIONS SO. AS THE STATE YOU KNOW AFTER. OUR SHELTER IN PLACE OBVIOUSLY THE STATE THEN. IMPOSED A SEPARATE SHELTER IN PLACE OF THE BLUEPRINT TO THE TEARS OF THE COLORS- WITH POLICIES OF THE COMPANY THAT. THAT WAS SOMETHING WE NEEDED TO ADAPT TO THE LOCAL LEVEL BECAUSE THESE THESE ARE NOT EXTERNALLY- IMPOSED. ADDED RESTRICTIONS AND REGULATIONS- WE HAD NO CLUE WE HAD NO. WE HAD NO CONTROL RIGHT SO- IMPORTANTLY. LOCAL THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS MUST BE OUT IN LINE WITH CALIFORNIA PUBLIC PUBLIC HEALTH. REGULATIONS IN THE FRAME BUT WE ARE NOT ABLE TO BE LESS RESTRICTIVE SO. OUR STRATEGY SHIFTED FROM LOCAL CONTROL. AND LOCAL DIALOGUE BASED ON OUR OWN RECOMMENDATIONS TO REALLY FIGURING OUT HOW WE CAN BEST. FOLLOW STATE REGULATIONS- AND THAT'S WHERE THAT I THINK IT WILL ALL END WITH THIS- YES FOR MY INTRODUCTORY REMARKS JUST THAT THAT- WHAT WE MIGHT DO BETTER. ONE OF THE AREAS THAT I THINK WAS WS THIS YOUR FRANKLY A STRUGGLE FOR US WAS. IN THE INTERPRETATION OF EVIDENCE WHEN THE STATES- REQUIRE THAT OUTDOOR DINING BE CLOSE- IT ALSO SHARES- IT WAS IT WAS A CHALLENGE IN TERMS OF- IT IN TERMS OF WHAT WHAT IS THE EVIDENCE OF FROM MARK FROM WITHIN IRAQ AFTER THE RECOVER SCOOP. RESTAURANTS ASKING WHAT IS THE EVIDENCE BASE FOR NOT ALLOWING OUTDOOR DINING- AND OBVIOUSLY. AT THAT POINT WE DIDN'T HAVE A STRONG EVIDENCE BASE FOR TRANSMISSION THAT OCCURRED IN OUTDOOR SETTINGS PARTLY BECAUSE WE JUST DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH. ENOUGH TIME UNDER OUR BELTS. FOR KILLING AN EVENT THAT EVIDENCE WOULD HAVE TAKEN THE FORM OF. KNOWN ACTS OF TRANSMISSION THAT OCCURRED IN OUTDOOR RESTAURANTS- OF A CERTAIN YOU KNOW IT ENDS AT A CERTAIN RATE UNFORTUNATELY. WE OUR CONTACT INVESTIGATIONS WERE NOT ACTUALLY ABLE TO ASCERTAIN THOSE WITH THAT LEVEL OF SPECIFICITY SO WE'RE RELYING FROM PUBLIC HEALTH STANDPOINT STAY WAS RELYING ON. ON UNDERSTANDING AND KNOWLEDGE OF WHERE TRANSMISSION MIGHT OCCUR WHAT THE CHARGE WAS AN ANNEX R. AND THEN APPLYING THE PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE TO SAY WE BELIEVE THAT THE SETTING IS SUFFICIENTLY. RISKY TO JUSTIFY A POLICY THAT PREVENTS THIS FROM HAPPENING EVEN IN THE ABSENCE OF SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE WHEN THAT MIGHT HAVE OCCURRED I THINK THAT'S AN AREA WHERE. WE COULD HAVE DONE BETTER- ENVY OF THE AND THE STATE MIGHT HAVE DONE BETTER IN TERMS OF COMMUNICATING THE RATIONALE FOR THAT DECISION THAT THAT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL JUST FRANKLY WAS WITH ONE OF THE ONE OF THE HARDER POLICIES AS I BECAME SO THE APOLOGIST. FOR STATE POLICIES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL MY RELATIONSHIP RESTAURANTS. SOMETHING JUST YOU KNOW TO BE ABLE TO DEFEND AS A DECISION. AGAIN PROBABLY. THE PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE. ALSO MAKING MAKING SURE THAT IT'S THAT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS ORGANIZE OUR SOCIETY AROUND AND THE QUESTION THAT WE ARE. ONLY ENGAGING IN ESSENTIAL ACTIVITIES SO YES FOOD IS ESSENTIAL YOU CAN GET YOU KNOW AND RESTAURANTS ARE ESSENTIAL FOR PROVIDING FOOD. BUT YOU CAN YOU CAN OBTAIN THAT TO TAKE OUT IT SO THAT AT AN OUTDOOR DINING EXPERIENCE IS NOT DEEMED ESSENTIAL- AND THEN- THE MENTAL IMAGE WE'RE TRYING TO. YOU KNOW AND THAT THE VISION OF A HEALTHY COMMUNITY WAS ONE WHERE PEOPLE BY AND LARGE SHELTERING AT HOME HUNKERING DOWN. NOT ENGAGING SOCIALLY NOT OUTDOORS. I MEAN NOT NOT OUTSIDE OF THEIR HOMES THAT WAS SORT OF A NARRATIVE AROUND WHY WE WERE. CLOSING OUTDOOR DINING THAT I THINK WAS NOT EFFECTIVELY COMMUNICATED- AND I SAID YOU KNOW A LESSON LEARNED. A LESSON LEARNED THERE- AND THEN I'LL JUST SEND TO S. I DO FEEL FOR THE FUTURE I DO FEEL HOPEFUL THAT WE ARE NOW IN A PLACE WITH A VACCINATION RATES THE CASE COUNTS CONTINUED DECLINE. JUNE FIFTEENTH. IS THAT APPROPRIATE HORIZON FOR US- AND WE ARE EXCITED ABOUT- YOU KNOW MANY OF THESE YOU KNOW THE PROBLEMS THAT I'VE DESCRIBED A PROBLEMS OF THE PAST. HOPEFULLY WE'LL YOU KNOW WE CAN LEARN FROM THEM FOR THE NEXT TIME- BUT I AM I AM SEEING THAT THE FUTURE IS NOT ONE OF TIGHT REGULATIONS IN THE RESTAURANT SECTOR- IT YOU KNOW. FOR MY PART BUT IF I WILL I WILL. OUR POLICY IN MARIN COUNTY THE COUNTY LEVEL IT'S GOING TO BE FOLLOWING THE STAGE WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE MORE RESTRICTIVE THAN THE STATE- AND WE'RE SEEING THAT IT'S LIKELY TO BE. A SERIES OF A GUIDANCE IS BASED ON PRINCIPLES OF SAFETY AND PERSONAL CHOICE. AND NOT TIGHT REGULATION AND YOU KNOW IT AND EVERY ASPECT OF. OF THE PRACTICE OF. APPROACHING RESTAURANT. THAT'S THAT'S ANOTHER SIGN OF THE PROGRESS FOR MAKING. THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS SURE THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WILL ALSO BE SENT ABOARD HIS HAS TO LEAVE IT HAS A QUESTION ONE OF THE GO AHEAD AND PROCEED CENTER. THANK YOU CHAIR AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. I WANT TO HARKEN BACK- I LIVE IN FRESNO COUNTY. AND DURING THE DURING THE PANDEMIC ONE OF THINGS THAT I WAS KEEN ON GETTING ACCESS TO WAS. A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF THE INDUSTRY TRANSMISSION RATES MEANING- IF WE'RE GONNA MAKE SOUND POLICY IN EVERY REGION OF CALIFORNIA SEEM TO HAVE A DIFFERENT SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES DIFFERENT PROFILE. IT BE TERRIBLY HELPFUL AT THAT POINT TIME FOR US TO UNDERSTAND- WE'RE THE SIGNIFICANT TRANSMISSIONS WERE COMING FROM I WOULD LATER FIND OUT FROM THE CALIFORNIA- OFFICIALS THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE. THEM AT THIS AT THE COUNTY LEVEL THROUGH THE COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT WE DIDN'T HAVE THEM AT THE STATE LEVEL SO WE WERE KIND OF RELYING ON OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE PATHOLOGY OF THE VIRUS TO MAKE PUBLIC POLICY DECISIONS BOTH STATE. AND CITY LEVELS AND AT THE AT THE REGIONAL COUNTY LEVEL SO MY QUESTION TO YOU. IF YOU COULD. I THINK THE PURPOSE OF THIS COMMITTEE AT LEAST FROM MY APPRECIATION OF IT IS WHAT LESSONS CAN WE LEARN FROM WHAT WE EXPERIENCED SO THAT WE CAN INCORPORATE THAT LEARNING INTO PREPARATIONS ARE FOR THE FUTURE. AND SO BASED ON THE COMMENTARY THAT YOU HAD FIVE A MOMENT AGO. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT HAVING A CENTRALIZED. PUBLIC HEALTH DIRECTIVE WOULD HAVE BEEN- MORE FORCEFUL AND RELIABLE- WAY TO ADDRESS THE PANDEMIC OR DO YOU NOW LOOKING BACK FIND THAT THE REGIONAL OR COUNTY BY COUNTY APPROACH WAS EFFECTIVE. IF THERE WAS IT WAS A HYBRID IF SOMEONE SENDS THEM TO THE FRAMEWORK THAT ALLOWED EACH COUNTY TO BE CLASSIFIED BASED ON BURDEN. INTO CERTAIN POLICIES THAT CORRESPONDED THAT BURDEN- I THINK THAT THAT STRATEGY WHILE IT TOOK A WHILE TO MAKE SURE- OVER THE COURSE OF THE PANDEMIC- WAS AN EFFECTIVE STRATEGY THIS IS NOT MY OPINION IS THAT THAT'S THE BEST WAY TO RECONCILE BOTH THE NEED FOR. EVIDENCE BASED ON CENTRALIZED STANDARDIZED PRACTICE WITH THE WITH THE HERITAGE IN AT THE DIFFERENCES AN ACCOUNT IN A STATE LIKE CALIFORNIA. FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES HUGE DIFFERENCES IN. IN EVERY ASPECT CULTURE POLITICS RACES AS THEY ALL THAT AS WELL AS TRANSMISSION RATES. YOU NEED ASYOU NEED AS A FRAMEWORK THAT HAS THAT FLEXIBILITY. OF MY CONCERN ABOUT COMPLETE LOCAL CONTROL WOULD BE THAT- THAT THERE WOULD BE A LOT MORE YOU KNOW OTHER FACTORS OUTSIDE OF SCIENCE THAT MIGHT DETERMINE WHAT THE LOCAL POLICIES WOULD BE. IN JUST A FOLLOW UP ON THAT I THINK ONE OF THE LESSONS THAT I PERSONALLY- TAKE IT AWAY FROM THE PANDEMIC EXPERIENCE. FIRST OCCURRED AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL WHERE WE- HAD- IS IN THE FORMER ADMINISTRATION A DECENTRALIZED APPROACH MEANING THAT STATES WERE ALLOWED TO MAKE DECISIONS OF THEIR OWN- AND I THINK THAT CREATED SOME SOME CHALLENGES ESPECIALLY WHEN IT CAME TO. PROCUREMENT OF RESOURCES WHERE MUNICIPALITIES COUNTIES AND REGIONS WERE COMPETING AGAINST ONE ANOTHER IN SOME FASHION ON THE MARKET. THEREBY INFLATING THE PRICE IN MAKING IT LESS RELIABLE FOR BUILDING OUT A PLAN SO IN ESSENCE. I THINK HAVING A NATIONAL STRATEGY WOULD HAVE BEEN TERRIBLY HELPFUL. AS WE WENT THROUGH THIS PROCESS BUT NOT HAVING THAT. AT THE STATE LEVEL- I THINK. THE- HAVING THAT HYBRID APPROACH THE YOU'RE THE YOU'RE REFERRING TO- IS A LESSON THAT WE CAN TAKE AWAY AS HAVING UTILITY- AND I'LL FINISH WITH THIS IS THE LA COUNTY WHEN ASKED WHAT THEIR TRANSMISSION RATES WERE. IN THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY THEY HAD A REPORT INDICATED THAT ROUGHLY 3% OF THE TRANSMISSIONS THAT THEY COULD ATTRIBUTE TO THE% RESTAURANT INDUSTRY NO I DON'T THINK ANYBODY ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT THAT WAS ENTIRELY ACCURATE- I THINK IT HAS A LOT TO DO WITH- A SHORTAGE OF INFORMATION. IN A BUNCH OF OTHER EXTERNALITIES OR HARD INVENTORY IN REAL TIME- BUT MOVING FORWARD WOULD YOUR RECOMMENDATION BE THAT THERE BE- METRICS AND- SAFEGUARDS IN PROCESS IS PUT INTO PLACE. AT A REGIONAL LEVEL OR EVEN AT A COUNTY LEVEL. THAT WE HAVE- TRACING OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE HAD BASICALLY FORSAKEN DURING THIS LAST PANDEMIC. YES YEAH I THINK IT'S CRITICAL FOR US TO AND WE HAVE WE HAVE A LOT MORE INFORMATION NOW THAN WE DID. YOU KNOW SIX MONTHS AGO AND MANY OF THESE POLICIES WERE BEING DEFINED WE'VE LEARNED A LOT MORE ABOUT THE RISK THAT OUTDOOR TRANSMISSION IS MUCH LOWER- THAT WASN'T AS CLEAR- FOUR- WE ALSO. HAVE A BUILD UP OUR OUR CONTRACT DISCUSSION INFRASTRUCTURE- THAT WILL GO WE WILL BE ABLE TO ASCERTAIN. WHERE TRANSMISSION IS OCCURRING MORE PRECISELY- ACROSS SECTORS AND THAT'S GOING TO BE CRITICAL INFORMATION FOR US FROM A POLICY STANDPOINT. OR THANK YOU. THANK YOU YOU ARE CONCERNED WHICH TED TO GET THANK YOU THANK YOU DOCTOR WILSON AND LET'S. MOVE EXPANDS WILL HAVE MORE QUESTIONS AFTER THE PANEL. OUR NEXT PANELIST IS JUSTIN MALEN. BETER DIRECTOR THE CALIFORNIA CONFERENCE OF DIRECTORS OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH. SIX TWO DH IS CONSIDERABLE IMPATIENT WITH THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY AND REPRESENTS THE SIXTY TWO LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH ENTITIES THAT ISSUE PERMITS. TO RESTAURANTS AND CONDUCT OVER FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND INSPECTIONS. AND. REALLY WELCOME- MISTER MOLOT. THANK YOU MR CHAIR BACK- WELCOME TO. ALL THE GUESTS AND THE AND THE OTHER- TEN DAYS THERE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO. PARTICIPATE TODAY I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF SLIDES WHICH I THINK MAYBE YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW UP SO. IF THE FACILITATOR WILL PUT UP MY SLIDES AGAIN JUST. SURE THAT SCREEN. I HAVE. EVER GONE. SO JUST GIVE THEM BACKDOCUMENTS AGAIN AN EXCELLENT. THE HEALTH CONCERN. I REMEMBER FOLKS ARE KIND OF PUBLIC HEALTH REGULATORS. IF NOT RUN PROGRAMS THAT MOST OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SIGNED BALL GAME AND THE RETAIL FOOD SAFETY SECTOR IS OUR NUMBER ONE PROGRAM BY FAR THE LARGEST EVER GOT OVER NINE HUNDRED LOCALS AND THAT ARE INVOLVED IN PERMITTING AND INSPECTION OF SOMETHING LIKE A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND RETAIL FOOD FACILITIES NOW THAT'S JUST THE RETAIL THAT'S WHERE THE FOOD FACILITIES. FROM HOT DOG CART ALL RIGHT THROUGH TO THE BIG BOX STORE AS DINING CONTACT. WITH THE PUBLIC. OUR SYSTEM DOES DO THE WHOLE SALE. THAT'S THE PART OF PUBLIC HEALTH. AND I'M NOT. GONNA HELP DEPARTMENTS IN PUBLIC HEALTH WHICH SOMETIMES IS A CHALLENGE IN ITSELF- SO ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH. CENTER OR IF. SINGLES FINALS BETWEEN FICTION GROUP CAL CODE THE RETAIL THROUGH GOOGLE. AND BECAUSE WE IN THE TRENCHES WITH THE RESTAURANTS- INSPECTING THEM TWO THREE. TIMES DDING YEAH I WE HAVE A CLOSE LOCAL KNOWLEDGE OF THOSE RESTAURANTS OF THOSE FACILITIES AND I FIND PHONES THAT CAN ALSO BE A VERY SIGNIFICANT ASSET IN THIS SITUATION LIKE LIKE THIS. I'M QUITE A ON IN THE PROCESS AND HELP THE RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. DEVELOP SAFE TO RETURN GUIDANCE- AND THE ADDRESS WAS ADOPTED AT A STATEWIDE LEVEL. AND I THINK THE POINSETTIA RAISED BY NUMBER AGAIN ABOUT GETTING THIS BALANCE. BETWEEN STATE DIARY. TELL FRANCO HE'S ENTITLED STANDARDIZED THE LOCALS ARE PRE EMPTED INSTEAD GIRL FROM COMING UP WITH DIFFERENT LOCAL STANDARDS RETAIL FOOD BUT OTHERS SEE THIS LOCAL IMPLEMENTATION YOU COULDN'T HAVE ONE STATE AGENCY RESPECTING SOVEREIGNTY DIFFERENT RESTAURANTS. AND ALSO WORKED FAIRLY EARLY ON WAS THAT WE WOULD BE INTERESTED PARTIES ARNOLD BILLS LIKE AB SIXTY ONE WHICH WAS AN EFFORT TO SORT OF ACCOMMODATE THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY FROM A- SAFETY PERSPECTIVE AND ALLOW THEM TO DO CERTAIN. THINGS I DON'T. THE BAND ALONG. IN AND SENSE AND I CAN TRY ON THOSE A LITTLE BIT SET ON A BIT LATER- NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. I YOU CAN ASK FOR SOME SPECIFIC QUESTIONS AND WE DID ALL OUR MEMBERS I WAS AT THE RESIDENTIAL TURN AROUND SO WE DIDN'T GET A CHANCE TO RESPOND BUT I THINK I DO A FAVOR HERE AND IT'S FAIRLY CONSISTENT I THINK THEY'VE GOT TO ACTION TALKING TO OUR MEMBERS REDRESS IS QUITE WELL REFLECTED ON THE SURVEY RESULTS BUT WHEN YOU ARE AS WELL IN FACT. IN- THANK THEN WE CAN DANCE WORKPLACE SAFE POLICY. AROUND I WAS PERCENT OF OUR FOLKS FACT THE NUMBERS THAT CAME IN RECENT TIMES. WELL SO HAVE A 60% YES WHY AM STAY WILL COMFORTABLE BECAUSE THEY- BECAUSE THEY ARE EXPERTS IN FOOD SAFETY BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE LOCAL CONNECTIONS THEY WERE ABLE TO THE BEST OF THEIR ABILITY TO GET THIS INFORMATION OUT AND EXPLAIN TO PEOPLE BOTH THE REGULATED COMMUNITY AND THOSE CUSTOMERS WHY HE'S REQUIREMENTS WITH THE HAND PLACED- I THINK THAT I HAVE A LOT OF CHRIST. WAS FAIRLY HIGH IN THE BEGINNING PEOPLE REALIZE THIS IS A MASSIVE ABSENT TO ALLIANCE AND LARGELY- WELL ACCEPTED IN THE EARLY MONTHS OF IT- THERE WAS INCONSISTENT SUPPORT FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE AND GAMES THAT COMES BACK TO THE ISSUE OF- BALANCING STATE AND LOCAL RESPONSE AS SOMETIMES THE LOCALS FELT THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE SUPPORT FOR THEM SOMETIMES LOCALS FELT THAT THEY WANTED. MORE WELL THEY AREN'T SO IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO SAY THAT ONE APPROACH AS I SAID EARLIER IS BETTER THAN THE OTHER BUT BY AND LARGE WE HAD THE BOOTS ON THE GROUND TO HELP EITHER IN EMPLOYMENT THE STATE POLICIES THE POLICIES THAT THE HEALTH OFFICERS UNDER THAT SORT OF POLICE POWERS I HAD AN ENQUIRING CLOSING THE LOCAL. LEVEL- TALKING ABOUT THE COMMUNITY AND THE SAFETY PART OF AND PROGRAMS AGAIN I THINK- MINUS- WASN'T EASY BUT IN THE EARLY MINDS. I LARGE PERCENT OF THE- AND THE THIS OF THIS. THAT WE HAD AND WERE QUITE RECEPTIVE VERY POSITIVELY RESPONSIVE- I GAVE OUT THE INFORMATION WHEN. REAGAN MECHANISM AS AN INFORMATION MECHANISM AND WE ALSO PROVIDED SOME PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT I THINK WHERE. AT A GAME DR WRIST BAND FOR INSTANCE WE RAN INTO PROBLEMS IS THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE IN MANY CASES AND NOT JUST THIS INDUSTRY ANY INDUSTRY AND ACROSS THE WORLD THIS WASN'T A CALIFORNIA ISSUE ACROSS THE ROAD WE DIDN'T. HAVE THE ONS SAYS. OUR SYSTEM OF THE QUESTION PEOPLE ARE ASKING. I'M TO FIND OUT IF THE CAR WAS IN NEW IS TO THE MOST INFORMED OF SPREADING THIS PANDEMIC AND WHEN DID NERVE RATE LATER REALIZED THAT ERA SOULS AND TRANSMISSION WAS PROBABLY MORE IMPORTANT SO THOSE ARE THE SORT OF THINGS THAT WE HAD TO ADJUST TO AS MANY AS YOU WENT. ALONG NEXT I BELIEVE. YEAH PARTY RELATED TO THE FACT THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE THE AUDIENCES AT FEDERAL STATE OR LOCAL LEVEL- I'M NOT SURE THE INFORMATION WAS FRAGMENTED AND HE- EVEN THOUGH WE TRY TO SHARE WHAT INFORMATION WE HAD WE ALSO HAVE TO BE COGNIZANT THAT SOMETIMES PUTTING ON PUTTING INFORMATION EVEN ADEQUATE INFORMATION WAS A BAD THING SO AGAIN IT WAS A ONE OF THOSE BALANCING ACTS. MOST OF THE LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH FOLKS HAVE A GOOD WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH SOME OF THE CHAPTERS OF THE CRA OR SOME BUSINESS COMMUNITY- GROUP THAT THEY WORK WITH AS REGULATORS ACT AS WELL IN THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY AS THE HAZMAT INDUSTRY OR THE INDUSTRY THAT CAN REGULATE AND WE UTILIZE THOSE FOR THE FOR THE- GROUP THAT I REPRESENT THE CONFERENCE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH FOLKS WE WERE VERY FORTUNATE AND PRIVILEGED TO HAVE IT SOUND WORKING RELATIONSHIP WAS HERE ARE AND I THINK MAX AND HIS FOLKS ARE FOLKS WHO COMMUNICATING FREQUENTLY WITH FAST. I THINK THAT REALLY REALLY HELPED. ONLY ONCE AGAIN- OTHER. YOU KNOW THERE'S A I THINK THAT OVERARCHING PROBLEM I'M NOT TOO SURE COAT IT WAS ALL THROUGH A Y. WE LISTED EXCESS SEDANS WHEN A MASSIVE ON WELL BEING THE BOTTOM LINE BUDGETS ON ON THEIR FAMILY LIVES THINGS STARTED TO HIT NOT JUST THIS INDUSTRY BUT OTHER INDUSTRIES WE STARTED TO SEE INSTEAD PUSHED BACK AND I THINK IT'S INEVITABLE YOU KNOW WE REALIZED IT WAS MORE THAN THE THREE WEEKS THAT SOME PEOPLE ANTICIPATED IT WAS FIFTEEN EIGHTEEN MANSON LAUREL AND WE ANTICIPATED- SHOWS A TIMELINE AND ALSO WHILE THAT FRUSTRATION. HE STARTED TO HATE US- SO NEXT TIME PLEASE. DAX COMBO. FROM SOME FROM. BECAUSE SOME BULLET J. SO OF FUN MAN. A LITTLE BIT OF A- TO HEALTH- I KNOW THAT THE HEALTH OFFICER DIDN'T IT DIDN'T- NEW TO DO LIST. IN AND THAT IS SOMETHING LIKE EIGHTEEN OF EYE HEALTH OFFICERS OF EITHER RESIGNED TO BEING SQUEEZED OUT WELL RETIRED OR WHATEVER THE CASE IS BUT ANOTHER LONG DAY IN THEIR POSITION THAT THEY HELD SOMETHING LIKE EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO AND THEY WERE UNDER INTENSE PRESSURE. AND OUR ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH FOLKS WERE UNDER NOT NECESSARILY THE SAME PRESSURE BUT THEY CERTAINLY HAD INTENSE PRESSURE BECAUSE THEY WERE THE ONES GOING IN AND SHUTTING DOWN PEOPLE'S LIVELIHOOD AND IS VERY VERY DIFFICULT. AND WHEN WE HAVE CONFLICTING VIEWS FROM OTHERWISE. TRUSTED SOURCES. WELL THE PRESIDENT WAS. ELSE FROM MANTA FRESH. WITH THE PUBLIC HEALTH MESSAGE AND I THINK THAT IS PROBABLY THE BIGGEST DIFFICULTY WE HAD TO FACE WHAT IS THIS BACKLASH TO WORK WITH. HEY REAL RESPECTED AND WELLNESS UNIVERSITY AND HE SAID TO DIRECTIVE FROM HEALTH OUGHT TO STORE HEALTH PERSONNEL THAT STARTED THE FRAME AROUND THE AGE SO THAT- THE FRUSTRATION AND ANGER. HELLO WHEN WE HAD TO GO IN AND ENSURE THAT WE- THAT THE- RESTAURANTS HAD TO CLOSE ALL FOLLOW CERTAIN PROTOCOLS- AND THEN THE OTHER THING YOU KNOW TO BE VERY HONEST AND FRANK ABOUT THE STADIUM BALDWIN'S. THIS STAGE STEP IN AND HELP WITH ENFORCEMENT IT WASN'T ALWAYS ON THE BACKS OF THE LOCALS AND GIVE HER SOME LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THEMSELVES DIDN'T ENFORCE IT FOUND THAT YOU KNOW. THAT SHERIFF'S OFFICES AND POLICE OFFICERS DIDN'T GO IN FIRST WHAT IS BOTH STATE LAW AND BAD PUBLIC HEALTH MANDATES SO THAT WAS A REAL CHALLENGE FOR ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH. I THANK YOU JUST SO OPTIMIZATION KNOW WANT THIS- INTERACT BALANCED BETWEEN STATE DIRECTIVES WHICH DOES NOT FIT THE WORLD DOESN'T STRIKE ME AT FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES IN THE NORMAL CITIES IN THE STATE BAGHDAD STATE DIRECTIVE WAS CRITICAL WE ALWAYS HAVE THE INPUT LOOKING FOR BUT ALSO MADE GAINS WE GOT TO A REASONABLE BALANCE AND NOW MOVING FORWARD. WE SEE WHERE WE CAN STRENGTHEN OUR SOME OF OUR COMMUNICATION. IS BASED. THE NATIONAL BUT I CAN ATTEST THAT YEAH AS I'VE BEEN WITHIN HEALTH. I CAN'T SAY FROM THE ONLY. I'M ABOUT TO NOT PERCENT. AND THAT'S NOT WILLIAMS REST I WANT TO THAT CLEAR WE HAVE SOME OF THE SAME FRUSTRATIONS IN THE WORLD. BECAUSE OF THE INDUSTRY AND BECAUSE OF OUR OVERSIGHT BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING EVEN THOUGH I WAS A KID SICK IN THEIR OWN HOME IT'S VERY. DIFFICULT TO TRACE PHONE BONELLI'S SOMETIMES IS VERY MINOR IT'S NOT SEVERE PEOPLE ARE HOSPITALIZED BUT IT COULD BE ATTRIBUTED TO SOME SORT OF. AN ILLNESS IS INFREQUENTLY REPORTED SO CONFOUNDING DAD WAS THE LACK OF EVIDENCE THAT HE HAD TO TAKE. A RIDE BECAUSE OF IT- WE- STRUGGLED. STRUGGLE TO EVIDENCE BASED REGULATION. SO AGAIN I WANT TO JUST THIS LAST LINE FROM SOME- FULL NAME HELLO DEPARTMENTS AND- FURTHER QUESTIONS PLEASE YOU KNOW SEND ME A TEXT OR AN EMAIL AND I'LL GET BACK TO YOU BUT I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO PARTICIPATING THE REST OF THE PANEL. THANK YOU MISTER CHIP AND DAN THANK YOU MISTER MONTGOMERY FOR YOUR TESTIMONY FROM MAKE YOURSELF AVAILABLE TODAY SO WHAT WE'LL DO- THE NEXT PANELISTS AND THEN WE'LL OPEN UP TO QUESTIONS FROM. THE COMMITTEE- THE FINAL KEY PRESENTER OF OUR OPENING PANEL THIS IS MATTHEW SUTTON SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS AND PUBLIC POLICY FOR THE CALIFORNIA. RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION MATT HAS BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN ARRANGING PERCENTAGE FOR HERE TODAY AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE THAT. WE ALSO PURCHASED WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH MY STAFF- AND LENDERS ACCESS TO HISEXPERTISE AND EXPERTISE OF THE INDUSTRY AS A LEADER AT CRA THAT KNOWS THE STRUGGLES ALL CALIFORNIA RESTAURANTS HAVE FACED AND CONTINUE TO FACE. AT THE IMPACTS OF THE PANDEMIC CONTINUE TO UNFOLD. WELCOME MR CERTAIN. THANK YOU MR CHAIR HAS MEMBERS MATT SUTTON YOUR RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION GOOD TO SEE HBO- AND FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP- THIS COMMITTEE CONTINUES TO DO AMAZING OVERSIGHT WORK- AT ITS INCEPTION WITH YOU CENTER IN DALLAS IS CHAIR AND- NOW WITH YOU SENATOR NEWMAN AT THE HOME- IN EACH OF YOU. AND VICE CHAIR BATES SO WE GREATLY APPRECIATED WE GREATLY APPRECIATE YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS ISSUE- I THINK SHE IS AS WE SAID. THERE'S ABSOLUTELY I THINK THE WORK PRODUCT BEFORE YOU- THE AGENDA ITSELF AND THE BRIEFING UNDERSCORE WHAT'S WHAT'S BEEN UNIVERSALLY ACCEPTED AND BOTH YOU CHAIR NEWMAN ADVICE SHARE BASED. ONE OF THAT OUT OF THAT IS THAT THE RESTAURANT COMMUNITY IS UNLIKE ANY OTHER EMPLOYMENT COMMUNITY IN THE STATE IN TERMS OF HOW THIS IMPACTED. BY THE CODE NINETEEN CLOSURES. SO WE YOU THINK ABOUT. THE RESTAURANT COMMUNITY I WOULD ASK YOU TO THINK OF IT IN TERMS OF THE LARGER RESTAURANT ECOSYSTEM- AND WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS THAT OF COURSE INCLUDES THE BRICK AND MORTAR RESTAURANT ITSELF. CERTAINLY THE TEAM MEMBERS BUT THE PURVEYORS AND SUPPLIERS AS WELL TO THOSE RESTAURANTS THAT PROVIDE FOOD AND ALCOHOL LINENS ALL KINDS OF THINGS THAT ARE ESSENTIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO RUN A RESTAURANT- IN THE MANY MANY MANY GROWERS AND THEIR TEAMS THAT- ARE PRODUCING AND GROWING THE FOOD FOR RESTAURANTS. SO CLOSING RESTAURANTS LITERALLY REVERBERATES ALL THE WAY BACK DOWN TO THE SOIL ALL THROUGH THE SUPPLY CHAIN AND INTO THE GROUND WHERE THE FOOD IS GROWN AND AT EACH STEP UNFORTUNATELY WITH RESTAURANT CLOSURES- THERE'S NATIVE EMPLOYMENT IMPACTS BUT EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE SPOTS ALONG THE SUPPLY CHAIN. SO OBVIOUSLY. VERY STRONG AND DECISIVE MEASURES WERE TAKEN TO CLOSE RESTAURANTS BACK IN MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY- WE'VE HAD SORT OF AN EVIDENCE FLOW SINCE THEN- AND WE REMAIN- NOT FULLY OPERATIONAL TODAY- AND THERE IS OPTIMISM AND I'LL GET TO THAT SHORTLY- THE ORDER TO SHUT DOWN RESTAURANTS AND MEDIA LEE WHAT WAS CERTAINLY- DECISIVE BUT ALSO YOU KNOW LOOKING BACK ON IT HAD SOME CONSEQUENCES- THAT THAT WE CAN NOW FULLY APPRECIATE AND ONE OF THOSE WAS YOU KNOW TELLING OPERATORS IMMEDIATELY THAT THEY MUST SHUT DOWN- IT LEAVES THEM WITH NO FLEXIBILITY TO RAMP DOWN OPERATIONS- IT LEAVES THEM WITH NO ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY DISTRIBUTE ALL THAT PRODUCT AND ALL THAT INVENTORY. OF FRESH FOOD- THE DAY HAD RECENTLY PURCHASED- AND THAT'S A COST TO IT RIGHT IT'S ALSO YOU KNOW IT'S UNFORTUNATE WASTE MANY RESTAURANTS PIVOTED AND GOT THAT FOOD OUT TO THE NEEDY TO THE HOMELESS OTHERS PROVIDED AS SORT OF GROCERY TYPE ITEMS AND DID A LOT OF INNOVATIVE THINGS- THERE WAS ALSO NO ABILITY TO SLOW DOWN- THE STAND THE STAFFING AND THT UNFORTUNATELY LED TO FORCED. LAYOFFS IN THE INDUSTRY OR TO SOFTEN THE BLOW TO THE PURVEYORS ALL OF THOSE ORDERS WHEN YOU MAGNIFIED ACROSS THE STATE RESTAURANT AFTER RESTAURANT AFTER RESTAURANT THAT'S COUNTLESS ORDERS IN COUNTLESS PEOPLE IN THE. SUPPLY CHAIN THAT WERE IMPACTED AS WELL. SO WE HAVE ANY RESTAURANTS THERE'S IN RESTAURANTS AND JEN THROUGHOUT STATE WE'VE ALWAYS HAD A LONG STANDING AND GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH HELP US HELP OFFICERS. IN THE STATE SIXTY TWO DIFFERENT HEALTH JURISDICTIONS. YOU MAY SAY WAIT WISER SIXTY TWO OUTER SECTIONS IT'S THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES AND THE CITIES BERKELEY- PASADENA BURDEN AND LONG BEACH EACH HAVE THEIR OWN HEALTH DEPARTMENT. AND SO THEY WERE THE VERY ENTITIES. THAT WERE PLACED AT THE FOREFRONT OF MANAGING- THE PANDEMIC CLOSURES ON THE GROUND. AND I JUST TAKE A MOMENT DOCTOR WILLIS IS ABSOLUTELY CORRECT AND EVERYTHING HE SAID ND SO IS MR MON- BOY. DAD AND THERE'S SO MANY TOUGH JOBS IN THE PANDEMIC- CERTAINLY HATS OFF TO OUR FIRST RESPONDERS BUT BOY HEALTH OFFICERS WERE IN A TOUGH SPOT AND WE ALWAYS RECOGNIZE THAT. EACH AND EVERYONE OF THEM TRYING TO DO THEIR BEST WITH AN EVOLVING VIRUS THAT THE WORLD WAS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT SO- VERY TOUGH AND- YOU KNOW DECISIONS MADE- ON THE FLY BECAUSE THEY HAD TO BE MADEON THE FLY AND THERE'S PLENTY THAT YOU KNOW. WE IS RESTAURANT REPRESENTATIVES IN THOSE OPERATORS DIDN'T ALWAYS AGREE BUT WE CERTAINLY CAN APPRECIATE- YOU KNOW THE VANTAGE POINT THAT THEY HAD IN THE RESPONSIBILITY THAT THEY HAD AND STILL HAVE TODAY- SO- I GUESS. I WOULD JUST MOVE ON TO YOU KNOW MR LAN REFERENCED THE CALIFORNIA RETAIL FOOD COALITION AND THAT'S A TWENTY YEAR OLD NETWORK OF FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL FOOD SAFETY OFFICERS REGULATORS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AS WELL AS REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE RETAIL FOOD COMMUNITY INCLUDING THE CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION SO JUSTIN MR MON REFERENCED EARLIER THAT WE ALL HUDDLED- AND CAME UP WITH A NUMBER OF OPERATING PROTOCOLS. BECAUSE RESTAURANTS WERE SHUT DOWN FOR INDOOR DINING MARCH TWENTY TWENTY AND IT WASN'T UNTIL CLOSE TO THE END OF MAY OF TWENTY TWENTY THAT THE FIRST RE OPENING IN SOME REGIONS THE CURBS- AND WE WORK TOGETHER BECAUSE WE'VE HAD THAT RELATIONSHIP- I WOULD SAY THAT FOOD SAFETY. AND TRAINING THAT'S OUR GAME THAT'S OUR WHEEL HOUSE WE'VE ALWAYS DONE THAT AND WE'VE ALWAYS. BEEN REGULATED. BY THE- THROUGHOUT THE STATE. SO WE ARE BACK EQUIPPED TO DO THOSE. GRANTED THE STATE A. FIFTEEN- BOOKLETS A VERY PRESCRIPTIVE MEASURES THE RESTAURANTS HAD TO TAKE IT TO BE OPEN MANY OF THOSE- CAME FROM THIS COLLABORATIVE WORK AND SO WE APPRECIATE OUR WORK WITH THE HEALTH OFFICER pPROTOCOL CERTAINLY COME WITH GREAT EXPENSE- AND SO YOU KNOW WE ROSE TO THE OCCASION WE DID THEM ALL- I THINK THERE WAS NO POINT AT RESTAURANTS- WE'RE LOOKING TO DO ANYTHING BUT- PROTECT THE PUBLIC THE DINING PUBLIC AND THEIR TEAM MEMBERS. I KNOW FIRST HAND THAT DROVE ALL OF THE DECISIONS THAT WERE MADE. THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC- AND AGAIN IT POINTS BACK TO BOTH THE STATE GUIDANCE- AND THE COUNTY GUIDANCE BECAUSE OF COURSE THE COUNTIES DO YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO ISSUE MORE RESTRICTIVE GUIDANCE IN THIS STATE AND IN MOST CASES. THESE DATA ACT AND- YOU KNOW THAT WAS WITH THE APPROACH OF SORT OF A REGIONAL RISK BASED ASSESSMENT- AND SOME WERE MUCH MORE RESTRICTIVE. THAN OTHERS ALIGNED WITH THE STATE. THE POINT IN ALL THIS- IS THAT IF YOUR RESTAURANT TOUR YOU HAVE THESE DIFFERENT LAYERS OF PROTOCOLS- AND BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THE PANDEMIC- YOU KNOW LOOK THE LANDSCAPE WAS CONSTANTLY SHIFTING UNDER EVERYBODY'S FEET BUT RESTAURANTS IN PARTICULAR- AND THAT MEANT. THAT HELP OFFICERS WHETHER AT THE STATE LEVEL OR THE LOCAL LEVEL WE'RE CONSTANTLY BEING FACED WITH THIS VIRUS THAT WAS NEW BY DEFINITION RIGHT- AND ALSO WAS OUTSMARTING EVERYBODY OUTSMARTING THE WORLD. AND SO THAT WAS I THINK WHAT. MADE A LOT OF THE PROTOCOLS AND REQUIREMENTS AND THINGS FOR RESTAURANTS EVOLVE. OVER TIME. AND SO AGAIN EVERYONE DID THEIR BEST WE FULLY APPRECIATE THE ROLE THE HEALTH OFFICERS AND WE KNOW WHAT THEY WERE UP AGAINST AND WE ALSO FELT THAT IMPLEMENTING SAFETY MEASURES. GIVEN ALL OF THE FOOD SAFETY AND OTHER TYPE OF SAFETY REQUIREMENTS THAT WE HAVE FROM THE REGULATED COMMUNITY AND THAT WE DO DAILY WE FELT VERY VERY EQUIPPED. TO IMPLEMENT THESE- SO WE PUT OUR BEST FOOT FORWARD EVERY STEP NO MATTER THE COST WITH THE PROTECTION OF OUR TEAM MEMBERS IN THE DINING PUBLIC ALWAYS DRIVING EVERY DECISION. SO MANY RESTAURANTS CONTINUE RUNNING ON THE ENORMOUS FINANCIAL LOSSES ACROSS THE BOARD. BUT PARTICULARLY WHEN IT CAME TO THE TAKE OUT MODEL- I KNOW THERE'S THE PERCEPTION THAT TAKE OUT IS SORT OF THIS THIS GREAT THING AND FOR MANY RESTAURANTS THAT IT IS BUT LOTS OF RESTAURANTS. ACTUALLY DON'T DO TAKE OUT OR THEIR PRODUCTS DON'T LEND THEMSELVES TO TAKE OUT SO IT IS NOT THE BE ALL END ALL SAVIOR. BUT CAN YOU TALK TO RESTAURANTS AND THEY TELL ME THAT I DID THIS AND IT WAS A HUGE LOSS FINANCIALLY AND I ASKED THEM WHY. AND THEY SAY OVER AND OVER AND OVER THEY RAN UP THESE LOSSES AND THEY DID TAKE OUT WHEN THAT WASN'T THEIR THING- TO DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO TRY TO KEEP ANY EMPLOYEES ON THE PAYROLL FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE. SO THAT THAT IS THE AMAZING STORY AND A GREAT SACRIFICE BUT CERTAINLY. AN EXAMPLE OF OUR RESTAURANTS ONCE AGAIN ROSE TO THE OCCASION SERVED THEIR COMMUNITY AND DID EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO KEEP EVERY LAST. LATE ON THE PAYROLL. SO I'VE NEVER SEEN- GREW OF EMPLOYERS- IN MY TWENTY YEARS OF WORKING FOR EMPLOYERS- SO EMPATHETIC. TO OTHER TEAM MEMBERS- THE COUNTLESS RESTAURANTS EVERYWHERE AGAIN THE GRAND CHAPLAIN ACTUAL LOSSES. TO KEEP THEIR DOORS OPEN TO SOME DEGREE EVEN IF IT WAS JUST FOR A TRICKLE OF REVENUE TO KEEP STAFF ON. WAS VERY IMPRESSIVE. AND SO IT WAS IN IT CONTINUES TO BE OUR WRENCHING REALLY- BUT I'VE NEVER SEEN OR BEEN MORE PROUD TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH AN EMPATHETIC HARDWORKING RESILIENT- AND SCRAPPY WHEN NEEDED- TO KEEP THEIR DOORS OPEN GROUP OF EMPLOYERS- SO AS WE LOOK TO THE FUTURE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER THAT TODAY. NO WHERE IN THE STATE IN A RESTAURANT FULLY OPERATES-% AND THIS IS BEEN THE CASE SINCE THE END OF LAST AUGUST BEGINNING OF SEPTEMBER- AND THEN PLACES LIKE LOS ANGELES COUNTY. AND OTHERS IT'S BEEN EVEN LONGER- AND FOR INDOOR OPERATIONS IN FULL CAPACITY THERE'S NO FULL CAPACITY ALLOWED ANYMORE. WE'VE SPENT THE LAST YEAR HUDDLED AROUND EVERY TUESDAY WAITING FOR THE STATE ANNOUNCEMENTS ABOUT THE FATE OF RESTAURANT OPERATIONS IN EACH COUNTY- AND THAT TUESDAY CADENCE CONTINUES. UP UNTIL TODAY AND WILL UNTIL JUNE FIFTEENTH PRESUMABLY. SO WE'VE KIND OF OPERATED AS THE ASSOCIATION LIKE AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL OR LIKE FOOTBALL QUARTERBACK YOU TAKING THESE PLAYS ARE DIRECTIVES FROM THE STATE AND COUNTY. PASSING THEM ON TO RESTAURANTS ON THE GROUND IN EVERY POCKET OF THE STATE SO THAT THEY COULD HAVE IT IMMEDIATELY TO THE ORDER FLUCTUATIONS OF THEIR OPERATIONS AND MAKE THOSE ADJUSTMENTS. SO WITH THE FAIR APPARENT FULL RE OPENING COME JUNE FIFTEENTH. VERY EXCITED WE THINK THAT THERE'S DEFINITELY- OPTIMISM IN THE AIR- BUT I WOULD HOWEVER CAUTION THAT RE OPENING IS THE FIRST MILE OF THE REALLY LONG. ROAD AHEAD TO RECOVERY FROM THE RESTAURANT COMMUNITY. IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSCORE THAT RESTAURANTS STATEWIDE AGAIN I'VE BEEN FORCED TO OPERATE IT UNSUSTAINABLE LEVELS FOR OVER A YEAR MEANWHILE THOSE FIXED COSTS INSURANCE BRANDS AND ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS- CONTINUED TO BUILD THE ENTIRE TIME THEY WERE CLOSE- AND SO THAT THAT RECKONING IS GONNA COME TO RESTAURANTS- FINANCIAL RECKONING. RESTAURANTS ARE GONNA NEED A LONG RUNWAY TO PREPARE FOR A SUCCESSFUL TAKE OFF AND IT'S GONNA BE CRITICAL THAT THERE'S NOT ANY DEGREE IN THE RUNWAY AND THAT INCLUDES POLICIES THAT ARE WELL INTENDED THAT MAY HINDER THAT RECOVERY. IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER THE SIZE OF A RESTAURANT. THEY ALL HAD TO NAVIGATE THE OSCILLATING SET OF OPERATING RULES- IT AND THEY WERE IMPACTED EQUALLY BY ALL OF THE PROTOCOLS AND RESTRICTIONS ON OTHER BUSINESS MODEL. EVEN SMALL RESTAURANTS ARE REALLY REALLY LABOR INTENSIVE. MANY MANY MANY PEOPLE OCCUPY SMALL RESTAURANTS IN TERMS OF. MAKING A RUN ON A DAILY BASIS RESTAURANTS ARE OFTEN SIZED UP BY HOW MANY EMPLOYEES THEY HAPPEN WE WOULD JUST CAUTION YOU NOT TO DO THAT BECAUSE EVEN THE SMALLEST OF RESTAURANTS. I HAVE QUITE A NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES. APPROXIMATELY NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND RESTAURANT EMPLOYEES IN CLIFORNIA WERE LAID OFF OR FURLOUGHED BETWEEN MARCH TWENTY TWENTY AND THAT AUGUST. CALIFORNIA RESTAURANTS AS YOU KNOW FROM YOUR DISTRICT OF THE CORNERSTONE OF EVERY COMMUNITY AND 60% OF CALIFORNIA RESTAURANTS ARE OWNED BY PEOPLE OF COLOR. RESPECTING THE AMAZING DIVERSITY OF THE STATE. PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC RESTAURANT COMMUNITY THROUGHOUT THE STATE WAS AN ECONOMIC ENGINE THAT EMPLOYS ONE POINT FOUR MILLION. SERVICE WORKERS AND GENERATED MORE SALES TAX IN ANY INDUSTRY. WE LOOK FORWARD TO BUILDING BACK TO THAT BUT IT'S GOING TO TAKE SEVERAL YEARS AND IT'S GONNA TAKE PROACTIVE POLICIES ACTUALLY LIKE CONSIDERING RETURN TO WORK INCENTIVES AND OTHER THINGS THAT MAY HELP RESTAURANTS GET THROUGH. THE FINANCIAL CRASH THAT'S COMING IN SOME OF THOSE. FINANCIAL ITEMS THAT HAVE BUILT UP OVER THE OVER THE YEAR WITH THE CLOSURES. SO AGAIN YOU'RE GONNA HEAR FROM RESTAURANTS THEY'RE GONNA SAY IT'S BEST WE REALLY REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR ATTENTION. TO THIS ISSUE AND TO THE INDUSTRY AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH EACH OF YOU CENTERS ON- YOU KNOW% GETTING BACK TO GETTING BACK TO NORMAL BUT ALSO GETTING BACK TO THE DRAWING. OUT THE MOST PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA AND GENERATING THE MOST SALES TAX REVENUE FOR THE STATE SO WITH THAT I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND- I APPRECIATED VERY MUCH. AND I THANK YOU MUCH CENSORED THANK THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY AND YOUR YOUR- POINTS ARE EXTREMELY WELL TAKEN RIGHT TO RESTAURANTS OCCUPY KIND OF ENTRY INTERESTING PLACE IN OUR- CULTURE- THEY ARE UBIQUITOUS- WE TAKE THEM FOR GRANTED SOMETIMES BUT BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THEY'RE NOT REALLY CHALLENGING BUSINESSES- AND THE PANDEMIC IS MADE THAT. EVEN HARDER SO AT THIS POINT I'D LIKE TO OPEN UP THE QUESTION OF SENATOR ROTH YOU HAD. A QUESTION- PLEASE GO AHEAD. BUT YOU MR CHAIR. THE FACT THAT THE- TITLE OF THIS PANEL INCLUDES THE PHRASE PERSPECTIVES ON IMPLEMENTATION I LIKE TO FOLLOW UP ON. THE QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS OF MY FRIEND THE SENATOR FROM FRESNO YOU KNOW I COME FROM INLAND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND THERE WAS A LOT OF CONTROVERSY. OVER THE RESTAURANT OPERATING RESTRICTIONS DURING THE- THE CODE PANDEMIC OF NINETEEN PANDEMIC SO FAR. A FULL CLOSURES PARTIAL CLOSURES. 25% OCCUPANCY 50% OCCUPANCY AND OF COURSE. WHETHER THOSE OPERATIONAL RESTRICTIONS WERE REQUIRED WHETHER THEY WERE. PROPRIOCEPTION AND EVEN WHETHER THEY WERE EFFECTIVE IN PREVENTING THE TRANSMISSION OF DISEASE SO TO SPECIFICALLY FOLLOW UP ON MY COLLEAGUE'S QUESTION- ARE WE ABLE TO DETERMINE OR ARE WE NOT ABLE TO DETERMINE TRANSMISSION RATES. IN RESTAURANTS IN THE RESTAURANT SETTINGS VERSUS OTHER SETTINGS LIKE BIG BOX RETAIL STORES AND SOME OF THE OTHER. CONSUMER INTERFACES THAT WAS WE'RE GOING ON DURING THIS PANDEMIC. WHETHER INDOOR OR OUTDOOR ON A STATEWIDE BASIS. IS THAT. THE QUESTION FOR ME ANYONE WHO CAN ANSWER IT. YEAH I CAN I CAN START- WE DO HAVE- YOUR EVIDENCE FROM FROM ACROSS THE NATION OF OUTBREAKS OF COVERT NINETEEN FACTUAL IT DID ORIGINATE IN INDOOR DINING ESTABLISHMENTS THERE'S A MORBIDITY MORTALITY WEEKLY REPORT NOTED WE ARE WHICH IS THE CDC'S. WEEKLY WEEKLY LITERATURE IN TERMS OF- INFECTIOUS DISEASE AND IT'S- THERE WAS A SORT OF A SEMINAL- STUDY THAT SHOWED THERE WAS A SUPER SPREADER EVENT THAT OCCURRED IN A RESTAURANT THEY DIDN'T HAVE- THERE WASN'T ADEQUATE VENTILATION IT WAS INDOORS. IT WAS ONE INDIVIDUAL- WHO THROUGH THEY ARE ACTUALLY ABLE TO CONTACT THE VERY AGGRESSIVE CONTACT TRACING. SS EIGHTEEN OTHER INDIVIDUALS WHO WITHIN THAT RESTAURANT WHEN IT GETTING INFECTED JUST BY HAVING BEEN IN THERE FOR ABOUT A TWO HOUR PERIOD WITH THIS ONE INDIVIDUAL- AND THEN THERE'S ANOTHER THAT WAS THE MOST DRAMATIC THERE'S BEEN OTHER. OTHER EVIDENCE OF TRANSMISSION WITHIN WITHIN RESTAURANTS I THINK ALL OF US AT THE LOCAL HEALTH OFFICER LEVEL IT IN OUR CONTACT TRACING. HOW FOUNTAINS ONE OF THE REASONS WE PRIORITIZED A WORKING AT THE RESTAURANT FOR TESTING THEIR EMPLOYEES AND B. VACCINATION ONCE ONCE YOU KNOW ONCE RESTAURANT EMPLOYEES BECAME. A PRIORITY GROUP- FOODS FOOD SERVICE SECTOR WAS WIDELY PLACE AND ONE OF THE FIRST TWO YEARS OF PEOPLE TO GET VACCINATED BECAUSE OF THE RISK OF INFECTION IN THAT SETTING. IT'S A- KLAY UNDERSTANDABLE JUST BASED ON THE FACT THAT WE KNOW THE TRANSMISSION OCCURS. BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS ARE CLOSE TOGETHER. OVER A PERIOD OF TIME WHEN THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO COVER THEIR FACES AND SO THAT'S THE- THAT'S THE CHARACTERISTIC OF AN INDOOR DINING S. EXPERIENCE. THAT IS CONCERNING FROM A PUBLIC HEALTH STANDPOINT AND THAT FURTHERMORE WE HAVE HAVE WE HAVE EVIDENCE OF TRANSMISSION IN THAT SETTING MY COMMENTS REGARDING. THAT THE PAUCITY OF EVIDENCE AROUND THE HARM OF OUTDOOR DINING IS A DIFFERENT QUESTION AND THAT REMAINS A QUESTION MARK IN MY MIND- BUT I HAVE NO GOOD NO DOUBT FROM A PUBLIC HEALTH STANDPOINT. OF THE OF THE NEED FOR- REGULATIONS AROUND DINING. WHEN THE BUYER IS. PRESENT AND IN THE IN COMMUNITIES CERTAINLY. OXIDATION HERE I THINK EVERYTHING. WHEN WE HAVE BACKS RATES WHICH WHEN YOU'RE DOWN AND ENTER INTO YOU UNDER. THE OF THE- IN THAT IN. WHEN THE REST TO THE QUESTION IS ANECDOTAL DATA AS OPPOSED TO. SCIENTIFIC AND STATISTICAL DATA. THEN I GUESS MY CONCERN I UNDERSTAND IT THE SINCE WE HAVEN'T HAD ONE OF THESE THINGS AND OVER A HUNDRED YEARS AS HE SETS MY RECOLLECTION IN THE UNITED STATES. I CAN UNDERSTAND THE- LACK OF ORGANIZATION TO COLLECT AND COLLATE DATA AT THE BEGINNING. I'M GOING TO BE LESS UNDERSTANDING AS WE MOVE TO THE HOPEFULLY LOGICAL CONCLUSION OF THIS PANDEMIC SOON I HOPE. IF WE DON'T HAVE A BETTER HANDLE ON. STATISTICAL DATA AND ANALYSIS WHEN IT COMES TO. TICKETS EARLY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY TODAY WHAT THE TRANSMISSION RATE IS FROM A STATISTICAL BASIS DATA THAT CAN WITHSTAND SCIENTIFIC ANALYSIS BOTH PRO AND CON AND ANECDOTAL INFORMATION ABOUT A SINGLE RESTAURANT WITH EIGHTEEN. INDIVIDUALS WHO- WHO CAME DOWN THE CALL THAT IF THAT WAS THE NUMBER. REALLY DOESN'T CUT THE MUSTARD WE DON'T KNOW WE DON'T KNOW THE PARTICULAR RESTAURANT THE VENTILATION SYSTEM THAT'S WHY THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME. SORT OF STATISTICS THAT'S COMPILED AND ANALYZED SO THAT WE CAN SORT OF LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD. KNOW AND UNDERSTAND THAT THE NEXT TIME WE HAVE ONE OF THESE I'M SURE I WON'T BE AROUND BUT- WHEN WE DO. SOMEONE CAN MAKE A LOGICAL DECISION AT THE VERY BEGINNING HOPEFULLY WE SHUT THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY DOWN. DO WE GO 225% CAPACITY AND DOOR BECAUSE THE STATISTICS SAY BUT THE CHANCES OF TRANSMISSION WHEN THERE'S ENOUGH SPACING AND THE OCCUPANCY IS RESTRICTED 225% OR MINIMAL OR DEMAND OF MISS. AM I MAKING SENSE. AND DO WE HAVE HAD SORT OF STATISTICAL DATA AVAILABLE TO US. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TODAY. AND IF NOT. MAY WE AS LEGISLATORS EXPECT TO SEE THAT. BY THE END OF THE YEAR OR BY THE END OF NEXT YEAR RELATED O THE CALL OF A NINETEEN. TEN DAMAGE. MAY I RESPOND TO AS A REGULATOR. PLEASE DO PLEASE. I WANT TO REINFORCE THE DOCTOR WILL ASSESS AND I AM NOT A PHYSICIAN I'M MOST ONLINE BUYING THE HOME FOLKS ARE NOT PHYSICIANS AND WE RELIED VERY HEAVILY ON OUR- PHYSICIANS. PARENTS AND OTHERS TO MAKE THOSE JUDGMENT CALLS BUT THEIMPORTANT PONT. THIS WHOLE REGIME RESPONSE FROM A REGULATORY PERSPECTIVE WASN'T BASED ON ANECDOTE. BASED ON VERY VERY SOUND PUBLIC HEALTH PRINCIPLES. YOU CAN TRANSPOSE OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH PRINCIPLES IF YOU HAVE A DISEASE THAT'S SPREADING AND TRIED TO ARREST THE SPREAD OF THAT DISEASE. MAY NOT HAVE HAD A RIDE ON SINCE WE MAY NOT HAVE. TIME TO DO ALL RIGHT THINGS BUT REMEMBER THIS WAS TIME. VIRUS CORRECT FOR THEM. PRINT OF TO RESPOND THIS. AND I THINK THE FANS TO. FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS THE I WORKING SHELDON THIS INDUSTRY. HE'S TRYING TO OPEN UP. THEY CAN DO IT SAFELY THAT WAS PRETTY. THE MOST IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION FOR PUBLIC HEALTH. ONCE AGAIN THE PUBLIC SECTOR NOBODY WANTS THE RESTAURANT STUFF TO BE SICK SO I WANT TO ENSURE THAT THERE WASN'T THIS. ANECDOTAL SORT OF SUCKING IT OUT OF THE SUN THIS IS HOW WE SHOULD GO ABOUT IT THIS IS THE RISK. WE FOLLOW THE SAME BASIC PUBLIC HEALTH. CALLS FOR STOPPING INDUSTRIES AND THIS IS WHAT WE WERE GIVEN BOTH OF US LISTEN DON'T MISUNDERSTAND ME. YOU MAY NOT BE THE RIGHT PANEL HERE FOR ME TO ASK HIS QUESTION. I'M NOT BEING CRITICAL OF WHAT YOU HAVE DONE DURING THIS CALL THE NINETEEN PANDEMIC WHAT I'M SINCE ITS PERSPECTIVES ON IMPLEMENTATION WHAT I'M LOOKING AT. IS SOMETHING IN THE FUTURE AND I WOULD HOPE THAT HAVING BEEN THROUGH THIS AS TRAGIC AS THIS HAS BEEN. FOR EVERYONE INCLUDING THOSE FAMILIES WHO HAVE LOST INDIVIDUALS TO COVER NINETEEN. I WOULD HOPE TAT WE'RE FIGURING OUT HOW TO COLLECT DATA TO. MAYBE CONFIRM THAT THE DECISIONS THAT WERE MADE DURING THIS CALL THE NINETEEN PANDEMIC WERE THE APPROPRIATE ONES. AND TO SET A STANDARD FOR RESPONDING TO A FUTURE PANDEMIC THAT WAS THE REASON I WAS ASKING ABOUT THE DATA COLLECTION. R. N. AND IF THE ANSWER IS WE'RE NOT COLLECTING IT THEN I GUESS WE'LL GET THROUGH COVERT NINETEEN AS A CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE WILL FIGURE OUT HOW TO HAVE A MORE DETAILED CONVERSATION WITH THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE. FOR DATA COLLECTION TO DETERMINE HOW WE FIX THIS THING. BECAUSE YOU KNOW IN THE FUTURE WE SHOULD HAVING BEEN THROUGH THIS I WOULD THINK WE SHOULD HAVE DATA. THEY WOULD INFORM OUR FUTURE PROTOCOLS AND FUTURE DECISIONS SHOULD WE FACE ONE OF THESE. PANDEMICS IN THE FUTURE BUT- PLEASE DON'T MISUNDERSTAND ME I'M NOT I'M NOT CRITICIZING THE- PUBLIC HEALTH COMMUNITY OR ANYONE ELSE. IN TERMS OF THE RESPONSE TO THIS COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC YOU KNOW AFTER ALL. NONE OF US WERE AROUND A HUNDRED PLUS YEARS AGO WHEN WE HAD THE LAST ONE SO. YOUR TERM WE'RE ALL WE'RE ALL ENTITLED TO BE TO BE CUT SOME SLACK ON MEDICINE THANK YOU FOR DOING THE JOB YOU DID I THINK I'M GOING TO CLOSE WITH THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THAT THAT'S A STRONG CLOSE IN A ROW SO- THROUGH THANK YOU THANK YOU AND I AND I'M SURE WE'LL GET. SOME ADDITIONAL PERSPECTIVES ON OUR NEXT PANEL- THE NEXT THE CEREMONY I BELIEVE YOU HAVE A QUESTION. EIGHTY TWO THANK YOU. AND THANK YOU TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM RIVERSIDE AT FIRST FOR CLOSING WITH THE FACT THAT WE DO NEED MORE DATA TO DETERMINE. YOU KNOW SHOULD THIS EVER HAPPENED AGAIN WHAT WE WOULD DO IT YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF- YOU KNOW. PROBLEMS AND REMEDIES WE WOULD BE ABLE TO OFFER TO ALL OF OUR DISTRICTS. YOU KNOW I COME FROM A FAMILY WHERE I HAVE-A LOT OF CLOSE RELATIVES WHO ARE IN THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS AND- WHAT I WITNESSED WAS. A SINCERE STRUGGLE. VERY SINCERE- STRUGGLED TO KEEP THEIR BUSINESS OPENED BUT ALSO DO RIGHT FOR EMPLOYEES- AND IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT I THINK YOU WATCH MANY DIFFERENT RESTAURANTS OF DIFFERENT SIZES- A DIFFERENT BUSINESS MODELS AND MANAGE THIS PANDEMIC IN A VERY DIFFERENT WAY. AND THERE'S SOMETHING THAT I THINK MR SUTTON SAID THAT STRUCK MY ATTENTION THAT WE KNOW THAT IF A LITTLE OVER OR SOMETHING AND I THINK I GOT THIS RIGHT NINE THOUSAND- EMPLOYEES WERE LAID OFF BY RESTAURANTS IN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT MANY MANY MANY RESTAURANTS DID THEIR ABSOLUTE BEST TO KEEP S. STAFF ON AND I KNOW HAT YOU'RE I MY FAMILY THAT WAS PART OF THE CONVERSATION. YOU ALSO MENTIONED THAT THERE WERE POTENTIALLY WORK INCENTIVES TO TRY TO GET FOLKS TO COME BACK INTO THE INDUSTRY. ANECDOTALLY I THINK AS THINGS ARE OPENING UP WE ARE HEARING THAT- SOME RESTAURANTS ARE SHORT STAFFED AGAIN BECAUSE THE BUSINESS MODEL IS VERY DIFFERENT FOR ALL RESTAURANTS LIKE. RESTAURANTS AND ALL THE SAME AND- I'M JUST WONDERING IF YOU COULD SPEAK TO SOME OF THOSE INCENTIVES OR I'M NOT SURE IF ANOTHER PANEL IS GOING TO COVER SOME OF THOSE INCENTIVES BUT I'D LOVE TO HEAR SPECIFIC IF THERE ARE ANY- PARTICULARLY AS THE RANGE FOR THE DIFFERENT TYPES. OF RESTAURANTS- CENTER IF YOU CAN REACH ME GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF SOMETHING LIKE THAT OR IF THIS IS GONNA BE ON IT. COMING AT ALL. AND I BELIEVE IT'S A QUESTION FOR MR SUTTON. THANK YOU MR CHAIR SENATOR MONA CREATED QUESTION- AND THE COMMENTS- ON IT AND YOU KNOW JUST TO UNDERSCORE THE JOB LOSS THAT OCCURRED IN THE RESTAURANT SECTOR WAS NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND- AND THAT WAS THAT WAS A SHORT TIME PERIOD AND AGAIN THAT THAT'S DUE TO THE ABRUPT NATURE OF THE DIRECTIVES TO TRY TO RESTAURANTS- IT IN SO. TO GET TO YOUR POINT ABOUT RE HIRING YES WE'RE THAT'S ALL WE'RE HEARING IT'S A NATIONAL ISSUE. NOT LIMITED TO THE RESTAURANT COMMUNITY IT'S A IT'S A BROADER REACTION AND YOU KNOW I DON'T HAVE ANY FORMAL PROPOSAL- TO SUGGEST ONE THING THAT YOU KNOW RESTAURANTS CONTINUE TO SAY TO ME. AND THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS YOU KNOW THAT THE STATE. IS IN THE SALES BEEN BLESSED WITH WITH ABUNDANT REVENUE- I READ YOU MAY NOT EVEN BE THAT WORK BUT HE ENOUGH RESOURCES TO. TACKLE A NUMBER OF ISSUES AND THERE'S LOTS OF PROPOSALS THE ADMINISTRATION IS PUT TOGETHER IN THE U. S. LEGISLATORS TO PUT TOGETHER. FOR HOW THAT SHOULD BE SPENT AND THEN THE BIG DECISIONS IN THE COMING WEEKS ONE THING THAT WE CONTEMPLATE IS. YOU KNOW THERE HAVE BEEN STIMULUS CHECKS THERE HAVE BEEN ONE TIME PAYMENTS AND THERE HAVE BEEN THOSE KINDS OF RELIEF EFFORTS. FOR THE UNEMPLOYED AND WE CONTEMPLATE SHOULD SOME SUCH A THING EXISTS ON A ONE TIME BASIS. TO INCENTIVIZE EMPLOYEES TO GO BACK INTO. THE JOB MARKET AND I WANTED THE JOB STAND AFTER THEY- YOU KNOW HAVE THAT JOB FOR APPEARED OF TIME WOULD BE A ONE TIME STIMULUS OR TYPE OF. SIMILAR TYPE OF PAYMENT WOULD IT MAKE SENSE- BUT YOU'RE RIGHT RIGHT NOW WE'RE JUST AT THE BEGINNING OF FEELING THIS CRUNCH OF THE DIFFICULTY OF. EMPLOYING IN HIRING PEOPLE AND I THINK THE RESTAURANTS ON THE NEXT PANEL- MAY BE ABLE TO TOUCH ON THAT A LITTLE BIT MORE. FOR YOU BUT I APPRECIATE IT. AND THANK YOU MR SENATE AND IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT CEREMONY THERE IS A GOOD QUESTION TO WE ACTUALLY INVITED. THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IS FAKE- IN THIS HEARING SPECIFICALLY WITH WITH AN EYE TOWARD. THAT QUESTION AND THEY WERE TOO BUSY APPARENTLY THEY DECLINED TO PARTICIPATE. SO. I'M NOT SURE WHAT THAT SAYS- MANY OTHER. FROM THE PANEL. A GOOD BOARD JUST. THEN I PAULA THIS IS SUCH A- IMPORTANT ISSUE. OF FOR ALL OF US- I HAPPEN TO SPEND A GOOD AMOUNT OF TIME. DURING THE MEETING HIM THE PANDEMIC WORKING ON. RESTAURANT WITH RELATED MATTERS. MAYBE I'LL POSE IT THIS QUESTION TO MR SUTTON. AND I HARKEN BACK- TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM RIVERSIDE WAS WAS TALKING ABOUT- WHAT WE HAVE TO LEARN. BECAUSE WE HAVE TO BRING- TO BEAR- LESSONS FROM THE PANDEMIC SO THAT WE ARE BETTER PREPARED THE NEXT TIME WHETHER IT IS. A VIRUS OR SOME OTHER- NATURAL ORGANIC CATASTROPHE- JUST A QUICK SIDE NOTE- WHEN I DID ASK. A VARIETY OF HEALTH OFFICERS IN MY DISTRICT WHICH INCLUDES ELEVEN COUNTY SO IT'S PRETTY SIGNIFICANT- NONE OF THEM ACTUALLY HAD STATS OR DATA. THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR AN UNDERSTANDING OF TRANSMISSION RATES BASED ON INDUSTRY. AND SO ON A CONFERENCE CALL WHERE MANY LEGISLATORS WERE PARTICIPATING- THE QUESTION WAS POSED TO. DR KELLY. IN THE RESPONSE WAS PUBLIC POLICIES BEING MADE. BASED ON THE PATHOLOGY AND BEHAVIOR OF THE VIRUS. AND I AND I UNDERSTOOD- YOU KNOW WHY THAT WAS THE CASE BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. THAT WE DO NEED METRICS WE DO NEED DATA IN THOSE FINER POINTS SO THAT WE CAN BETTER APPRECIATE. HOW TO TAKE CORRECTIVE ACTION- WITH A SCALPEL INSTEAD OF A BROAD SWORD WHICH GETS ME TO MY POINT HERE TO MR SUTTON. TWO POINTS THAT I THINK I'D LIKE YOUR COMMENTS ON- DO YOU THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL IN A FUTURE SITUATION THAT WE HAVE. THE MET THE LEGAL MECHANISM FOR THERE TO BE EMERGENCY ALTERNATIVES PUT INTO PLACE AND WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS FOR EXAMPLE WHEN WE WENT INTO SHUT DOWN FOR THE INTERMITTENT SHUTDOWNS DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU WERE IN THE STATE- RESTAURANTS. IN BARS IN SOME INSTANCES WERE ALLOWED TO IMMEDIATELY USE. THE SIDEWALKS. AND THE PARKING FACILITIES ADJACENT. TO EXTEND THEIR SERVICES INTO THOSE AREAS SO THAT THEY WOULD BE OPEN AIR- SCENARIOS. SHOULD THERE SHOULD WE BE RECOMMENDING THAT THERE BE CERTAIN EMERGENCY ALTERNATIVES- PUT INTO PLACE BY LEGISLATION OR EXECUTIVE AUTHORITY. THAT WOULD ALLOW THAT TO OCCUR ACROSS THE STATE AND ALL POINT TO SAN DIEGO IS PROBABLY BEING ONE OF THE LEADERS. IN THE IN DOING THAT. THE DAY AFTER THE PAYMENT OF ONE THE SHUTDOWNS OCCURRED AND THE SECOND. IS THAT NOT ALL RESTAURANTS ARE IDENTICAL. CANNOT OVERSTATE THE OBVIOUS BUT ONE RESTAURANT IN PARTICULAR IN FRESNO COUNTY. IS DESIGNED IT AS LARGE AS THIS WHOLE- BYE AND IT IS COMPLETELY OPEN. MEANING IT'S GOT WINDOWS ALL AROUND BUT HAS IT ROOFTOP. ESSENTIALLY IT IS AN OPEN AIR RESTAURANT. THERE WAS LITTLE FLEXIBILITY SHOWN TO THE OWNER OF THIS RESTAURANT WHO WAS BRINGING AND SCIENTISTS IN PERSONS KNOWLEDGEABLE ON- ON ON HOW TO DEAL WITH VIRUSES. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD ALSO HAVE EMERGENCY- LEGAL ALTERNATIVES FOR FOLKS IN THE INDUSTRY BUT IF THEY CAN DEMONSTRATE. THAT THEY ARE SATISFYING THE PUBLIC HEALTH NEEDS. IN THE PROTOCOLS THAT EXIST WHETHER BE THROUGH VENTILATION OR BY ARCHITECTURE AND DESIGN THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE FREEDOM TO OPEN UP. IN A DIFFERENT CAPACITY THAN A COMPLETELY CLOSED SMALL OPERATIONS OF YOUR COMMENTS AND THOSE TWO HAD APPRECIATED. IT OR JUST A PREVIEW OF THE QUESTION YES- I THINK THE SHORT ANSWER IS YES AND I THINK WE LEARNED A LOT A NUMBER OF THINGS- ABOUT THE VIRUS IN AS WE LEARNED THAT AEROSOL TRANSMISSION WAS A BIGGER CONCERN IT MEANT THAT THOSE OUTDOOR ENVIRONMENTS BECAME MUCH MUCH MUCH MORE ESSENTIAL- AND THAT WAS A PUBLIC HEALTH MEASURE BUT IT WAS ALSO A LIFELINE FOR RESTAURANTS DISCONTINUE DISTURB THE PUBLIC. AND KEEP THEIR STAFF ON BOARD SO I THINK WHEN YOU ASK ABOUT THE LARGER QUESTION AND I THINK WE LEARNED SOME GOOD THINGS AND I THINK WE LEARNED THAT YOU KNOW EXPANDING OUTDOOR FOOTPRINTS- YET YOU KNOW WITH SOME MODERNIZATION- AND GUARDRAILS AROUND IT IT IS SENSIBLE IT'S SO SENSIBLE. THAT WE'RE ASKING FOR THAT TO BE CONTINUED FOR A LITTLE BIT LONGER VS IN LEGISLATION- AND WE WOULD ARGUE THAT IN THOSE CASES IT ACTUALLY MIGHT MAKE SENSE PERMANENTLY BUT TO GET TO YOUR QUESTION ABSOLUTELY WE HAVE LEARNED THAT THOSE THINGS ARE GOOD COMMUNITIES LIKE THEM AND THEY CAN BE DONE WITH GOOD PUBLIC HEALTH. PROTOCOLS AND IT CAN BE DONE WITH PROTECTING PUBLIC SAFETY SO YES ON THAT FRONT- AND WHEN YOU ASK ABOUT AIR FLOW AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE YES I THINK WE'VE ALSO LEARNED IN THIS THAT AIRBORNE TRANSMISSION OF. THIS DISEASE- WHAT WAS THE MAIN CONCERN. AND OFTEN RESTAURANTS. HE KNOW HAVE A LOT OF A- AND RESTRICT ON THEM. WHAT CAN AND CANNOT HAPPEN WHEN IT COMES TO OPEN AIR FLOW- AND SO- I KNOW A NUMBER OF INSTANCES WHERE PEOPLE WERE JUST TRYING TO INCREASE THE AIRFLOW IN THEIR RESTAURANT. THE HELP. ON THE PUBLIC HEALTH PROTECTIVE BASIS- AND THAT IS FOR BED AND- AND SO SOME OF THOSE ARE BEING LOOKED AT IT BEING RELAXED IN LEGISLATION. TO CONTINUE- THAT FLEXIBILITY AT LEAST FOR THE NEXT LITTLE WHILE AND THERE'S TWO BILLS IN PARTICULAR AND ONE BASICALLY SAYS. YOU KNOW WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE THESE THINGS SHOULD THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR CREW. WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE THESE THINGS FOR ONE YEAR AFTER THE PANDEMIC STATE OF EMERGENCY- YOU KNOW GOES AWAY- SO. LONG ANSWER THE ANSWER IS YES TO BOTH. AND AFTER SHE HAD. APPRECIATE THAT ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE PANEL. SURE DOT. I THINK I MIGHT WANT TO HEAR FROM THE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS ON THIS JUST. BRIEFLY I THINK HE- IT'S EASIER RETRO. TO HE'LL COME UP WITH YOU KNOW WITH THE PLANET ONCE AGAIN. YOU'RE NOT TO BE DEFENSIVE OF THE DECISIONS WERE MADE. BUT AT THE SAME TIME TO RECOGNIZE. THERE IS NO PLAYBOOK AND I THINK MAYBE WHAT WE'RE LEARNING HERE IS FROM A TOP PUBLIC HEALTH STANDPOINT. IS THERE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US MOVING FORWARD. TO DEVELOP A KIND OF PLAYBOOK FOR PANDEMIC TYPE OF SITUATION. YEAH IN THE FUTURE I THINK IT'S PRETTY TOUGH TO- GET A BIG STATE LIKE CALIFORNIA WITH FORTY. MILLION PEOPLE TO BE GIVING FREE PASSES TO SADDAM AND NOT TO THE OTHERS AND- IT CREATES AS MANY PROBLEMS AS IT IT SOLVES THE FIRST PLACE. I DON'T KNOW IF ANY OF THE HEALTH DIRECTORS WANT TO. COMMENT ON THAT LAST QUESTION. THANK YOU MR CHAIR PRACHANDA. OKAY LET ME ADD TO IT I'M SURE THIS FOR MR MANOJ TO SOME GOOD QUESTION. FOR YOU AT YOUR AGE SO WE IN THE LEGISLATURE PUSHED ET DE FAIRLY HARD TO. BE BETTER PREPARED FOR THE NEXT RECESSION- MYSTERON YOU MENTION THAT YOU KNOW YOU YOU HAVE THERE ARE PRICING NINE HUNDRED STAFF COLLECTIVELY ACROSS STATE DOING. ENVIRONMENT HEALTH THE ENFORCEMENT. YOU KNOW THAT'S CLEARLY NOT ENOUGH. IN IN A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY SO ALSO LIKE YOUR THOUGHTS AS YOU RESPONDED DONE. AS TO HOW TO HOW TO PLAN BETTER FOR THE KIND OF SURGE. IN CAPACITY THAT WILL BE NEEDED- IN THE EVENT. OF A SIMILAR HEALTH EMERGENCE. RIGHT I MUST REFERRED TO THE DOG. IN THE WRONG. BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE ON BEHALF OF THE RATE. AND AS I SAID WE TAKE ON GUIDANCE. THE DOCKS- THAT WE SHOULD. HAVE TO STRENGTHEN OUR- CAPACITY IN LOCAL AND STATE PUBLIC HEALTH. ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WE HAVE. IN OUR MENTAL HEALTH IS THAT A LOT. OF PROGRAMS ON A FEW SUPPORTED. GENERAL JOHN TENNIS NOT A NAGGING SESSION. I THINK IT'S JUST AN OBSERVATION I BELIEVE THE HEALTH OFFICERS HAVE PROPOSALS TO GAIN GOING HAND SAYING OUR CAPACITY TO DO AROUND JUST LIKE WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT AND I DIDN'T MEAN TO BE OVERLY DEFENSIVE. IN MY LAST RESPONSE BECAUSE I DO THINK THAT. WE ARE ABSOLUTELY. SO ASKED HAVE THE NAME BECAUSE- GOOD TO HAVE HIM CURRY COOL DATA. TYPES OF DISEASES THAT ARE GOING TO BE DIFFERENT THAT ARE GOING TO REQUIRE A DIFFERENT RESPONSE IS GOING TO BE AROUND A CHALLENGING BUT I. SEE FOR ADDITIONAL FOR ALL PUBLIC HEALTH IN GENERAL STATE AND LOCAL DEVELOP THE CAPACITY WHICH WE CURRENTLY DOESN'T HAVE. YOU KNOW Y'ALL CORRECT YES MA'AM DON'T HAVE ANY EMPIRICAL DATA TO HOLD UP AND SHOW THE REGULATED COMMUNITY IN SOME CASES AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO RELY ON COMMON MEDICAL SESSIONS AND PROTOCOLS AND IMPENDING ALLERGY IT'S CETERA. FINANCIAL THAT WE DOING THE BEST THAT WE CAN. BUT I THINK DOCTOR WAS MADE NOW TO EXPLAIN WHAT CAPACITY WHEN TRYING TO DEVELOP TO BE ABLE TO HAVE SOME BROADER CAPABILITIES FOR THE NEXT. TIME WHICH HOPEFULLY ONE COME. YEAH THANK YOU- YEAH I AGREE I MEAN I THAT'S- THAT'S A QUESTION ROSS STRUGGLING WITH AT THIS POINT NOW AS WE START TO EMERGE OUT OF THIS I THINK WE'RE ALL. ALL LOOKING AT THE AT THE LESSONS LEARNED IN DIFFERENT SECTORS TODAY'S YOU KNOW TALKING ABOUT RESTAURANTS BUT IT'S REALLY. THIS IS THE SAME CONVERSATION IS HAPPENING ACROSS DIFFERENT SECTORS AND I WOULD SAY THAT YOU KNOW THE QUESTIONS THAT CAME UP AROUND. DATA NE OF THE ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE DON'T HAVE THAT LEVEL OF SPECIFICITY OF. ATTRIBUTION OF TRANSMISSION HAS OCCURRED IN ONE SITTING VERSUS ANOTHER IS THAT IN THE PUBLIC HEALTH WORK FORCE- HAS DESIGNED FOR PRE PANDEMIC TIMES IN MY STAFF. ACCOUNT INTO A FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE FIVE PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES THAT ARE DOING TO REGULUS IS HIV HEPATITIS C. CONTACT INVESTIGATIONS. OVER NINETEEN- AND THE CASELOAD LITERALLY AND INCREASES BY ONE HUNDRED FOLD I MEAN IT'S NOT A LITTLE INCREASE RIGHT TO USE A RESTAURANT AN ALLERGY LIKE IF YOU'RE A RESTAURANT THAT ONLY SERVES TWENTY FIVE PEOPLE. HE GOT TWENTY FIVE C. SEVENTY TWO HUNDRED FIFTY PEOPLE ARE TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE SHOW UP I MEAN IT'S SUCH A IT'S SUCH A- DRAMATIC INCREASE IN THE- DEBT THE AMOUNT OF WORK THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN IN ORDER TO DO. A THOROUGH CONTACT INVESTIGATION FOR EACH CASE SO I THINK ONE OF THE KEY TAKE HOMES IS THAT WE NEED TO HAVE THAT. TRUE PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE NECESSARY TO MEET THE DEMANDS OF THE PANDEMIC WHEN IT OCCURS. AND THAT'S A GOOD THING PART OF THE PART OF THE WORK OF THE FUTURE- AND WE'RE YOU KNOW WE'RE WORKING WITH- WITH LEGISLATORS TO TRY AND ENSURE THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY ABLE TO STAFF TO THE CAPACITY THAT. THAT WE'RE GOING TO NEED- DOWN THE ROAD. TO THE QUESTION OF THE- OF THE- YOU KNOW THE DATA. ENTER OF TRANSMISSION- WE ARE APPLYING PUBLIC HEALTH PRINCIPLES- AS ENVIRONMENTAL DIRECTOR INDICATED WORK WORK FINE WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT HOW THE DISEASE IS TRANSMITTED TO ANY SETTING WHERE THOSE CONDITIONS ARE IN PLACE SO I THINK AS WE STEP BACK WE ALSO NEED TO BE HUMBLE ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO EXPECT NEXT TIME THAT A PUREDATA RIGHT IT'S BEGINNING. THAT THAT SEEMS TO BE BEING ASKED FOR AT THIS POINT IN TERMS OF POLICY WE KNOW THERE'S A RESPIRATORY ILLNESS IT'S TRANSMITTED BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS OF A CERTAIN DISTANCE RUSSIA NOT COVERING THEIR FACES WE WOULD ASSUME THAT. KIND OF DILIGENCE AND GOOD PUBLIC HEALTH PRACTICE ASSUME THAT TO BE TRUE WHETHER IT'S HAPPENING IN A CHURCH THAT'S HAPPENING A RESTAURANT WHERE THERE'S HAPPENING AT SCHOOL BUT THERE'S HAPPENING AT HOME. AND WE SEE THAT ACROSS THE BOARD- AND SO THAT'S THAT- YOU KNOW THE LOGIC AND THE PRINCIPLE THAT I THINK WE NEED TO FIRST FOR LIVE ON AS WE- ARE ABLE TO SOMEWHAT MORE SPECIFIC EVIDENCE- AS PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE. FOR SECTOR BY SECTOR USING GOOD DATA THAT'S ACCUMULATED THROUGH AN ADEQUATE-PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE THAT CAN ACTUALLY ACQUIRE THAT KIND OF DATA REPORTED. THANK YOU DOCTOR MOST. OF THE SHOW WE WILL MOVE ON I'M SURE WE'LL REVISIT SOME OF THE STRANGE. GUY IN THE NEXT PANEL WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO THE NEXT PANEL TO EXPLORE CROSS SECTION OF RESTAURANT INDUSTRY EXPERIENCES. DURING THE PANDEMIC WILL HEAR PERSPECTIVES FROM OPERATORS OF SMALL TO MID SIZED ESTABLISHMENTS AS WELL AS AN INDEPENDENT OWNER. WE ALSO HAVE A RESTAURANT WITH US TODAY DID PARTICIPATE IN THE GREAT PLATES DELIVERED PROGRAM DISCUSSED THEIR EXPERIENCE. WITH THIS COMMUNITY A PROGRAM PROMPTED BY THE PANDEMIC WILL HEAR FIRST FROM JOHN TALENT SHOWS. MR COACHES PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER. OF SPECIALLY RESTAURANTS CORPORATION S. R. C. IS A FAMILY OWNED ENTERPRISES BEEN IN BUSINESS FOR OVER. SIXTY YEARS MR TELL SHOW OVERSEAS OPERATIONS SEVERAL RESTAURANTS INCLUDING. NINE THROUGHOUT THE SOUTHERN. CALIFORNIA REGION WELCOME MISTER TASHA. AFTERNOON HI CHAIRMAN VICE CHAIRMAN AND OTHER SENATORS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME TODAY. REALLY APPRECIATED. YOU KNOW SO FAR THIS IS BEEN NOT REALLY. INTERESTING AND EDUCATIONAL FOR ME. ALWAYS SOMETHING MORE TO LEARN SO THANK YOU. HI I'M A SECOND GENERATION RESTAURATEUR WERE OUR FIRST RESTAURANT OPENED IN NINETEEN FIFTY EIGHT MY DAD. CALLED THE REEF RESTAURANT. IT WAS THERE EVEN BEFORE THE QUEEN MARY OPENED UP. AND OVER TIME. WE EXPANDED TO OTHER RESTAURANTS THROUGHOUT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THE CASTAWAY. BURBANK AND- THE PROBLEM BIRD ALLEY ACTS. WE DEVELOP PORTS OF CALL VILLAGE BACK IN THE DAY. OR CHILL RESTAURANT TO NAME A FEW OF OUR OUR LOCATION SO. AS A FAMILY BUSINESS ALL OF OUR FAMILY MEMBERS GREW UP IN THE BUSINESS. I STARTED AS A- AS A DISHWASHER AND- AND- YOU KNOW IT WORKED OUR WAY UP AND- THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS HAS BEEN PART OF OUR FAMILY. YOU KNOW FROM OVER SIXTY YEARS SO. YOU KNOW THIS IS BEEN ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE WE ARE FACED. AND YOU KNOW BEING A FAMILY. WHEN YOU HAVE TO LAY OFF AS MANY PEOPLE FOR LOW I SHOULD SAY AS MANY PEOPLE AS WE DO IT. NOW IT WAS IT WAS EMOTIONAL TIME AND I THINK FOR ALL THE OTHER OPERATORS ON THIS CALL IS GOING TO SAY. YOU KNOW THOSE WERE TIMES WERE. YEAH NOBODY KNEW IF WE WERE GONNA MAKE IT THROUGH WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN NEXT WE HAD A LOT OF PEOPLE LOOKING TO US AS THE LEADERS IS. TO GIVE PEOPLE ANSWERS. SO LIKE RESTAURATEURS- WE FIGURED IT OUT. AND WE WERE QUICKLY TO PREVENT TO- WHAT WAS NEEDED. TO SURVIVE. A SCHOOL MORE BACK AS WE HAVE EACH OKAY. WERE LITTLE YOU B. ALMOST FIFTY PER OF OUR- BEFORE THE PANDEMIC WAS DRIVEN. SELLS RESTAURANT LIKE A HOTEL BUT WITHOUT THE HOTEL ROOMS. A SO A LARGE PART OF MY BUSINESS TODAY IT STILL IS NOT OPEN AND% OPERATING BECAUSE THE EVENT BUSINESS BEING RESTRICTED. I SWEAR THAT'S KIND OF A LADDER FOR US- BUT WE HAVE RESTAURANTS IN FLORIDA WE HAVE SIX RESTAURANTS IN FLORIDA SO. ONE IN NEW YORK STATE AND- TO AN OHIO SO WE HAD A CHANCE TO. YOU KNOW EXPERIENCES IN MANY OTHER STATES TO SEE HOW THINGS WRE HAPPENING THERE VERSUS HAPPENING YOUR CALIFORNIA. WE'RE THE ONLY COUNTY WE HAVE ORANGE COUNTY SO WE GOT A CHANCE. TO WORK WITH IN DIFFERENT COUNTIES. BUT FOR US IT STARTED OUT WITH US. FOLLOWING 92% OF OUR STAFF. AND YOU KNOW THAT WAS REALLY DIFFICULT AS YOU PROBABLY REMEMBER BACK IN BUT THAT TIME IT WAS REALLY DIFFICULT FOR. FOR EMPLOYEES TO GET UNEMPLOYMENT. YOU KNOW THERE WAS A RUSH FOR THAT. MY FAMILY AND I CREATED A SIGNED AND FOR ABOUT THREE WEEKS WE'RE ACTUALLY FINDING OUR EMPLOYEES EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE FURLOUGHED. ACIDITY STILL COULD HELP PAY FOR ESSENTIALS. BECAUSE IT WAS- IT WAS EMOTIONAL TIME FOR THEM AND VERY DIFFICULT- BECAUSE OUR RESTAURANTS DIDN'T GET ANY NOTICE WE HAD QUITE A BIT OF FOOD. WE HAVE DONE THAT YEAH TEN TWENTY THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS WORTH OF FOOD IN OUR RESTAURANTS AND LOTS OF PAPER TOWELS LOTS OF TOILET PAPER. AND SO WE SWITCHED AND WE ACTUALLY DID CARE PACKAGES FOR OUR TEAM MEMBERS AND THAT WENT ON FOR SIX MONTHS. YOU KNOW YOU AS YOU RECALL IT WAS A CRAZY TIME PEOPLE CAN GET IT BUT INTERESTING ENOUGH THE SUPPLIERS IN THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS AT AN OVERSUPPLY. OF THESE PRODUCTS AND YOU KNOW WE'RE ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE OUR. OUR EMPLOYEES FOR THAT. IT'S A RESTAURANT HAD A HUNDRED EMPLOYEES. IN AFTER CLOSE. TO TWO. TRAIN TO GO. WE DROP DOWN TO THE SEVEN TO TEN EMPLOYEES. FOR REST. BECAUSE THE MY TO DO TO GO DIDN'T REQUIRES PEOPLE BECAUSE WE WEREN'T SERVING YES. SO WE TRY TO TRANSITION THESE TWENTY THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT RESTAURANTS. DID YOU GO AND FOR US IT WASN'T A VERY GOOD TRANSITION WE'RE VERY EXPERIENCE WE OUT. EACH YEAR FULL ICONIC LOCATIONS WITH USE AND- YOU KNOW FOOD IS. PART OF THAT EXPERIENCE BUT THE LOCATION WAS A HUGE PART SO FOR US TO GO ACTUALLY COST US MORE MONEY. AS THE NEXT COUPLE MONTHS OF EXPERIMENTING WITH TO GO WE WERE ACTUALLY. LOSING MORE MONEY THAN WE ARE ACTUALLY GAINING. BY THE CLOSE. YEAH THAT WAS REALLY DIFFICULT BECAUSE A LOT EMPLOYEES WERE HOPING TO SEE THAT THAT WAS KIND OF RAMP. UP AND BE SUCCESSFUL AND FOR US. WE HAVE A- REALLY LARGE OUTDOOR PATIO SPACE WE HAVE A LARGE PARKING AREAS. AND SO ONCE WE WERE ALLOWED TO INVITE GUESTS BACK TO OUR SITES. I WOULD SAY WE WERE THE POSTER CHILD FOR. A SUCCESSFUL STRATEGY FOR A RESTAURANT. YOU KNOW YES THEY CAN BE SPREAD OUT. THEY REALLY ENJOY A SHOWING UP TO THE LOCATIONS AND FEELING SAFE. AND YOU KNOW WE CREATED A LOT OF SPACE AND SO WE FOUND OURSELVES. IN MANY OF OUR RESTAURANTS THAT WERE OPEN DOING AS MUCH BUSINESS WE ARE THIS WE WOULD BE DOING WHAT WE ARE DOING IT FAST. IT'S THAT MUCH DEMAND RIGHT NOW UNFORTUNATELY I ADDS FIVE RESTAURANTS ARE CLOSED IT DIDN'T REALLY HAVE THIS TYPE OF SETTING I KNOW MANY RESTAURATEURS. ON THIS CALL YOU DON'T HAVE THOSE SETTINGS IF YOU COULD EXPAND LIKE WE COULD. MAKE UP THE DIFFERENCE SO WE'RE KIND OF- YOU KNOW YEAH SHE STIR FAMINE IN OUR BUSINESS RIGHT NOW WITH OUR LOCATIONS- MEETINGS THAT WE ARE ABLE TO DO WHILE WE WERE OPERATING. YOU KNOW OU LOOK FOR THE GOOD IS THAT WE WERE SUPPLYING MEALS TO THE ORANGE COUNTY FIRE IN ORANGE COUNTY POLICE LA COUNTY BECAUSE WE HAVE A LARGE KITCHENS YOUKNOW JUST DIDN'T FEEL RIGHT TO NOT DO ANYTHING SO WE REACHED OUT TO SEE WHAT WE COULD DO. AND YOU KNOW THAT WORKS OUT REALLY WELL FOR NOW WE'RE SUPPLYING YOU KNOW COUPLE MEALS A DAY FOR A WHILE AND THE TEAM MEMBERS YOU KNOW WE'RE REALLY EXCITED FEEL LIKE YOU'RE PART OF SOMETHING- WE ALSO DONATED EXTRA MEALS TO SOME HOTELS. HOSPITALS I THE AREA. YEAH YOU KNOW YOU JUST GAVE OUR TEAM MEMBER SOMETHING THAT THEY FELT LIKE THEY WERE CONTRIBUTING WELL YOU KNOW THE EARLY DAYS. EVERYBODY WAS JUST SHUT DOWN. YOU KNOW I THINK ONE OF THE- THAT ALL OF US FACED IS THAT WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME AND MONEY. FIGURE OUT WHAT'S THE NEW PLANE STILL GONNA BE WE SPEND MONEY ON. PROTECTIONS IN DIVIDERS- ALL KINDS OF THINGS TO CREATE AREAS SAFE FOR OUR GAS. AND THEN WE THOUGHT WE WERE DOING WELL WITH THAT AND THEN. YOU KNOW THAT. LIKE ANYTHING ELSE TO FIND OUT MORE WHAT WORKS WHAT DOESN'T WORK AND YOU FIND OUT THAT SOME OF THOSE PROTECTIONS. WERE A WASTE OF MONEY- WE GOT CLOSED DOWN OUTDOORS YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE IT GOT. A SHOT AT THE GUY- YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND. THAT TO DATE ABOUT THAT NOT LIKE TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT. LATER MY ROOM REMARKS STATING IT WAS IT WAS VERY CHALLENGING TO GET TO WORK. YOU KNOW OUTDOOR DINING WASN'T GONNA WORK. FOR US TODAY. WE ARE PLANNING ON. OPENING A THREE OF OUR FIVE RESTAURANTS HERE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. ONCE JUNE FIFTEEN HEADS WHEN WE HAVE LESS RESTRICTIONS ON OFFENSE. WE REALLY TRIED THAT BY JAPAN'S. AND GUESTS ARE STILL LITTLE HAS ATTEMPTED TO GATHER TOGETHER. AND TO YOU KNOW A BIG EVENTS LIKE WE HAVE YOU KNOW TWO HUNDRED THREE HUNDRED GASKET SET IN OUR BALL ROOMS. NOW ARE GOING TO BE A WAYS DOWN THE ROAD WE DON'T ANTICIPATE EVEN THROUGH THE HOLIDAYS. AND THAT THE EVENT BUSINESS IS GOING TO BE. THAT STRONG JUST BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S A HESITATION. AND WE HAVE A LOT OF CORPORATE CLIENTS THAT YOU KNOW CORPORATE CORPORATIONS ARE READY. TO STEP UP AND- AND- AND- SO THERE'S GOING TO BE ON. RAMP UP ON THE EVENT ISN'T ANYBODY IN THE CATERING BUSINESS RENTALS THAT KIND OF STUFF IT'S GONNA BE. IT'S GONNA BE A WHILE. YEAH AND- IT YOU KNOW TODAY WE'RE FACED WITH HUGE SUPPLY ISSUES WE TALK ABOUT LABOR. BUT ON THE SUPPLY SIDE. YEAH BECAUSE THE LABOR CAN'T GET YOU KNOW WITH TRACKING. AND AND PRODUCTION SIDE WE'RE SEEING A SUPPLY ISSUE OUT THERE. IN SOME CASES YOU KNOW IT'S TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING. AND I'M A LITTLE AFRAID THAT YOU KNOW WITH ALL THE MONEY COMING INTO EMPLOYS. SOME PEOPLE WOULD SAY IT'S KEEPING HIM FROM WORKING. IN A LOT OF MONEY IS FINALLY BACK TO THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY. AND IT'S SOMEWHAT ARTIFICIAL IN THAT YOU KNOW IT'S FLOWING TODAY. YEAH PLEASE OUT OF WORK AND YOU HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO DO SO THEY'RE EATING IN RESTAURANTS AND SO THAT'S FANTASTIC. BUT THAT'S KIND OF THE SHORT ROUTE SHORT RUN SOLUTION FOR US YEAH WE STILL THINK WHEN THAT'S DRIES UP IT'S GOING TO BE VERY CHALLENGING. WHAT ONE LAST THING I'D LIKE TO SAY IS THAT. YOU KNOW AS FAR AS THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT'S CONCERN. I THINK IT'S REALLY KIND OF IRONIC ABOUT WHAT WHAT HAPPENED I WOULD SAY GOING IN THE PANDEMIC BEFORE. THAT R. AS RESTAURATEURS OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT. WELL IT WAS ONE THAT ALL INDUSTRIES. TOP OF MINE EVERY DAY WAS CAST SIXTY AN EMPLOYEE SAFETY. AND WE FELT WE HAD A VERY UNIQUE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE HEALTH DEPARTMENTS THAT IF THERE WAS A MESSAGE TO PROTECT YES. OF COURSE THERE'S ALWAYS BAD ACTORS OUT THERE BUT I WOULD SAY. YOU KNOW 99% RESTAURANTS WANTED TO DO THE RIGHT THING. THAT WE SHOULDN'T YOU KNOW WOULD BE THE ONES TO BE CALLED UPON TO DO THE RIGHT. AND UNFORTUNATELY. I'M YOU KNOW AND IN THIS KIND OF TIES BACK TO SOME OF THE STUFF THE PROTECTIONS WHEN YOU HAVE GROCERY STORES BEING REMAIN OPEN AND OTHER PLACES. NOT BEING ASKED TO BE CLOSED I THINK THERE WAS A REALLY AN OPPORTUNITY TO RESTAURANTS. TODAY THIS DAY I THINK THERE'S A PROBLEM WHETHER PERCEIVED MAYBE NOT TO BE A SAFE PLACE TO GO TO BECAUSE- EVERYBODY WAS BACKED AGAINST THE WALL TO SAY WELL WHY ARE YOU CLOSING OR CLOSING ON BECAUSE IT'S NOT SAFE. WHEN WE REALLY. MAYBE DIDN'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION BUT PRECAUTIONARY WISE WE HAD TO DO THAT AND I UNDERSTAND THAT. BUT I THINK THERE IS FOR RESTAURANTS TODAY PART OF OUR CHALLENGE IS OUR MESSAGING BACK TO OUR GAS HOW DO WE BE PERCEIVED AGAIN AS A SAFE PLACE. THAT WE DO HAVE THEIR- BEST INTEREST IN MIND. AND THAT- AND BILL BACK THAT RELATIONSHIP THAT WAS VERY STRONG WITH THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT SO THAT WE CAN WORK TOGETHER. BECAUSE WE REALLY DO RELY ON THEM. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR SHAYS WHO. WILL NOW MOVE ON TO THE NEXT HOUSE TONIGHT. WITH AN EYE ON TIME I'D I'D ASK. THAT EACH OF THE SECOND PANELIST BAM. THE TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE- EXPEDITE YOUR REMARKS THAT WE DON'T RUN OUT OF TIME. AVONEX WILL TURN TO JENNIFER PUSHER- WITH HODGMAN HOSPITALITY GROUP. THE HOSPITALITY HOTEL GIVES A FAMILYOWNED RESTAURANT GROUP OPERATES IS NINETEEN FIFTY ONE. AND AS A IN HOUSE COUNSEL AND IS PUSHING MANAGES THEIR DATED A HUMAN RESOURCES OPERATIONS- AND WE LOOK FOR YOUR PERSPECTIVES. GOOD AFTERNOON. VICE CHAIRMEN SENATORS ASSEMBLY PERSONS AND STAFF THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT OUR EXPERIENCE OUR SYSTEM TAKES AWAY AND WHAT NEED REALLY NEED I'M FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA'S GOVERNMENT RIGHT NOW IN ORDER TO MOVE FORWARD SUCCESSFULLY SELL A LITTLE BAD ABOUT. HOSPITALITY WE ARE FORTY THREE LOCATIONS FORTY ONE OF THEM ARE IN CALIFORNIA WE- ARE EXPERIENCING A BAD ERRORS ON IT AS WELL AS YEAH. BEAR WITH A CALIFORNIA WE'RE WITHIN THREE YEARS- AND A TOTAL OF NINE HEALTH DEPARTMENT BECAUSE WE'RE ALSO IN LONG BEACH I'M PARTICULAR NOTE. ATLASSIAN JEALOUS COUNTY AND ALAMEDA COUNTY AND I'M ECSTATIC LONG BEACH COUNTY WE HAVE THE MOST PARTICULAR EXPERIENCE WITH THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT- NOW ALL I HAVE BUT I'D LIKE TO DO IS JUST. HAVE THREE QUICK TALKING PLAIN AREAS THAT I THINK WILL NEED THE MOST HELP TO BE SUCCESSFUL AS A RESTAURANT GOING FORWARD AND THEN I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THE REASONS WHY. I'M FIRST IT JUST REQUIREMENTS IN RESTAURANTS THERE'S BEEN SO MUCH TALK ABOUT NO MORE MASS. I'M WHICH IS HELPFUL TO SOME GAS FOR US WE HAVEN'T HAD ANY INCREASE IN OCCUPANCY- SINCE WE MOVED INTO THE RED CHAIR BECAUSE ALL OF OUR BILLS ARE STATIONARY AND EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE HUGE TALL PARTITION. ARE WE CAN'T EVEN GET. PERCENT ARE. IN OUR RESTAURANTS BECAUSE THE DISTANCE TEAM- LOCKED INTO THIS COUNTY PARTICULARLY CAN'T MOVE OUR TABLES. WE'RE REALLY NOT ABLE TO SEE MANY PEOPLE SO WHILE THE MASS WELL IT'S EXCITING TO SLAM IT IT'S NOT GOING TO HELP DRIVE BUSINESS- AND ALLOW US TO HIRE BACK WHERE WORKERS- SECONDLY IT'S WITH THE WORKERS WORKERS LEFT CALIFORNIA LAST THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY. I THINK. THE STRUTS BROKE AGAIN I MEAN. WITHIN FORTY EIGHT HOURS I FIRST HAD TO HELP FURLOUGH OVER TWO THOUSAND. BECAUSE WHEN YOU SHUT CAME INTO PLAY NOT ONE. BUT TWO TIMES AND THEY WERE EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY YOU HAVE TO SEND EVERYONE HOME. AT LOOKING BACK AT THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE POSSIBLY WE COULD. FOR THE LAST YOU PAUL IF YEAH ACTIVE DATE WASN'T IMMEDIATELY. I'M AND IT WENT ON FOR SO LONG- IN TERMS OF THE CLOSURE ARE I'M DINING SCENE AND THEN THE CLOSURE AND OUTDOOR DINING. AND THEN FINALLY WHAT THE BRAND STANDS BECAUSE ORIGINALLY I THINK THERE WAS LEGISLATION. WELL RESTAURANT GROUPS WITH LANDLORDS THAT WERE BEING UNREASONABLE AND RENEGOTIATING RENTS AND THEN THAT WAS TAKEN OFF THE TABLE GOING FORWARD YOU KNOW A LOT OF IT WAS JUST RIGHT TO FARM IT AND EVEN THOUGH WE ARE A LARGE RESTAURANT GROUP OUR OVERHEAD IS VERY HIGH. IN TERMS OF ALL OF THAT YOU KNOW GREAT WALLS WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA FOR OUR INCREASED MINIMUM WAGE- BUT IT'S ALSO INCREASED COSTS. AND WE'RE STILL TRYING TO FIND A WAY FORWARD- AND ALSO I THINK WHEN YOU GET BACK TO WORKERS THE IMMIGRATION REFORM REALLY HELP US IN THAT AREA AS WELL. I'M I JUST WANT TO MAKE BAD THREE POINT TO KIND OF DRIVE THOSE THREE SOLUTIONS I'M OFFERING. OUR SUGGESTIONS. THAT MADE SEVENTY AREAS SUCH. FOR US DURING THE PAST. I PERSONALLY HAVE SEEN I'M EIGHTY NINE OUR HEALTH DEPARTMENTS IN CALIFORNIA WE NEEDED MORE OF A CONSISTENT WALL. I'M FINE YEAH I PROVIDED A LOT OF GUIDANCE BUT THEN WHEN WE HAD A HEALTH DEPARTMENT LIKE LAST ANGELES COUNTY THAT MULTIPLE DAYS LATER WITH BRO I'M- ALAS CENTRALIZE MORE RESTRICTIVE APPROACH. AND WE ALREADY STARTED MODELING OURSELVES AFTER THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THEN FRIDAY AT SIX PM LOS ANGELES COUNTY BUT BRING OUT THEIR REGULATIONS RIGHT. YEAH BEIJING ALL ACTIVE IMMEDIATELY FOR ALL OF YOUR SERVERS I MEAN THERE WERE NO FACE SHIELDS WE LITERALLY HAD TO DRIVE TRAFFIC CALIFORNIA TO GET SPACE YELLED BY THE NEXT MORNING- AND AGAIN ALSO THE TACTIC PARTITIONS WE SPENT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS I'M PAST THAT PARTITIONS THAT. WE WERE NEVER ABLE TO USE AND THEN IT'S A NICE. PERCEPTION FOR SAFETY. I BUT LACK OF. A CONSISTENT RULES- AND THEN THE LACK OF EDUCATION BEHIND THOSE WALLS AGAIN WE HAVE MANY RESTAURANTS IN LA COUNTY SO THAT MOST OF MY EXPERIENCE. BUT IT WASN'T NECESSARILY EDUCATION BASE THERE WERE A LOT OF OCCASIONS WHERE WE WERE DOING EVERYTHING THEY COULD TO FOLLOW ALL THE RULES AND WE WOULD BE. FINE NO WARNING A FINE AND IT JUST FELT LIKE WE WERE TRYING TO DO EVERYTHING WE COULD FOR OUR WORKERS AND IT OUT SOMEWHAT AND IF YOU NEED AN APPROACH ONE IN EVERY OTHER ASPECT OF YOUR COMPLIANCE. I'M AND THAT ALSO GOES LAG AND THEY TRAINED ME MESSAGE EVERYTHING WAS EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY. AND THERE WAS WASTED FOOD IF THERE WAS YOU KNOW I WAS TRYING TO COMPLY WITH THE CHILD LEARN AND OTHERWISE AT THE SAME TIME PROVIDING EMPLOYEES WITH SUFFICIENT NOTICE WHEN WE HAD TO CLOSE. TWENTY LOCATIONS- WITHIN A FORTY EIGHT HOUR PERIOD MORE THAN ONCE- AND THEN AGAIN THE NOTE THE NOTE. WELL RANTS KERAMAT OURS FOR LANDLORDS I UNDERSTAND THEY HAVE THEIR OWN LENDERS. BUT AT THE SAME TIME- THAT THAT GOES A LOT OF OUR MONEY THAT WE WEREN'T BRINGING MEN AND I KNOW THERE WAS SOME ASSISTANCE FROM THE GOVERNMENT WHICH IS GREATLY APPRECIATED AND UTILIZED IN BRINGING BACK OUR WORKERS- BUT IT IS STILL AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE. WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE REOPENING- AND I WOULD LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT. HI I MEAN I HAD THE ABILITY TO JUST IMMEDIATELY GO OUTSIDE IN THE FUTURE LIKE SAN DIEGO DID WOULD BE AMAZING ESPECIALLY IN LA COUNTY. BECAUSE I LANDLORDS FORCED US TO RENEGOTIATE OUR LEASE SAYS TO GET THAT EXTRA SPACE TO PAY MORE FOR THAT SPACE IN THE PARKING LOT. AND IT WOULD TAKE WEEKS TO RENEGOTIATE IT AT TIMES. I'M SO WHAT HELPED IF THEY COULD HAVE DONE AND IMMEDIATELY WENT OUT OR DINING WAS OPEN- AND ALSO LIKE IN SOME OF OUR LOCATIONS WE TOOK THE REAL FIVE OR THE WINDOWS LOCKED. AND WE HAD A LOT OF SPECULATION AND THAT IS ONE OF THE LA COUNTY LOCATIONS THAT WE GOT I MEDIATE WE SAT DOWN AT BECAUSE IT WAS OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU WANTED THE OPEN AIR SPACE- BUT IT TURNED OUT- OUR CREATIVE. SOLUTION WHAT THE NEXT STEP. THANK YOU MUCH FOR TIME AND YOUR ENERGY. IT WAS- THEY FELT LIKE. ME WE ALL HAVE LEARNED A LOT FROM THIS PAST YEAR AND I HOPE THAT IN THE FUTURE ARE ARE WE HAVE A BETTER ATHLETES FORWARD ASK YOUR DISCOUNT AND MAKE AND ANY FUTURE ONE. AND SO WE CAN BE MORE SUCCESSFUL ASK FOR OUR EMPLOYEES AND- YOU'RE PROVIDING SERVICE TO THE COMMUNITY THANK YOU THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR MAKING YOURSELF WELL AND FOR YOUR PERSPECTIVE- WILL HAVE QUESTIONS HAVE THE PILLARS-% THIRD PRESENTER WILL BE LOWER IN THE GROUP. WHO WITH HER HUSBAND PAUL ARE THE PROPRIETORS OF ROOF DESTROYED CONTRA COSTA COUNTY- AND SHE MANAGES THE SERVICE THE MARKETING AND EVERYTHING ELSE RELATED TO THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE. IN A SMALL RESTAURANTS WHO WILL COMMISSION A GROUP. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME- SENATOR NEWMAN THANK YOU FOR SETTING UP THIS PANEL AND FOR ALL OF THE SENATORS AND ASSEMBLY PERSON THAT ARE ON THIS THANK YOU. SO A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT ME BECAUSE I THINK- I'M IN A KIND OF A UNIQUE POSITION SO MY HUSBAND AND I OPENED THIS RESTAURANT FIVE YEARS AGO- WHERE THE PARENTS OF THREE. GIRLS AGES THIRTEEN TWELVE AND TEN. BUT IN ADDITION TO OWNING A RESTAURANT IWAS ALSO A PART TIME EMPLOYEE AT A HOTEL IN SAN FRANCISCO IN THEIR BANQUET DEPARTMENT I'D BEEN THERE FOR TWENTY ONE YEARS. AND SHE GETS A HIGH END RESTAURANTS- I PROBABLY HAVE SERVED I SERVE THE GOVERNOR SEVERAL TIMES US SENATORS DIGNITARIES. AND SO I DID THAT JOB I LOVED IT BUT ALSO PROVIDED HEALTH INSURANCE FOR MY FAMILY. IT ALSO PROVIDED A THIRD OF OUR FAMILY'S INCOME- AND MY PERSPECTIVE ON THE WHOLE BIT SITUATION WAS A LOT DIFFERENT THAN MANY OF MY OTHER RESTAURANT. OWNER ASSOCIATES IN THIS AREA BECAUSE I WAS GETTING BRIEFED EVERY TIME I WENT INTO WORK FIRE GENERAL MANAGER OF WHAT SHE WAS HEARING FROM THEIR CORPORATE OFFICE- I WAS WORKING IN SAN FRANCISCO WHEN NANCY PELOSI FAMOUSLY CAME TO CHINA TOWN. I TOLD EVERYONE TO COME VISIT. AND THEN ONE DAY LATER MAYOR BREED SHUT THE CITY. DECLARED A STATE OF EMERGENCY. REALMS AGAINST A SMALL FRENCH BISTRO MY HUSBAND IS AN IMMIGRANT FROM FRANCE HE'S BEEN HERE FOR ABOUT TWENTY YEARS. FRENCH FOOD IS NOT TAKE OUT FOOD. WHERE A HIGHER END RESTAURANT OUR AVERAGE TICKET PRICES AROUND SEVENTY DOLLARS A PERSON. WE'RE OPEN FOR DINNER ONLY FIVE DAYS A WEEK WE'RE CLOSED ON SUNDAYS AND MONDAYS. AND OUR PROFIT MARGIN IS ABOUT FIVE PERCENT. SO FOR EVERY HUNDRED DOLLARS THAT WE BRING IN. FIVE DOLLARS OF PROFIT AND THAT PROFIT DOESN'T INCLUDE THE INITIAL LOAN THAT WE TOOK OUT TO BUY THE RESTAURANTS. SO EVERY DOLLAR THAT WE MAKE AS PROFIT. IS GOING BACK INTO THE RESTAURANT TO PAY OFF OUR LOAN. AND HOPEFULLY CREATE A SAVINGS ACCOUNT FOR US. SO WHEN WE GOT THE NOTICE ON A SUNDAY. THAT NEXT WEEK OUR RESTAURANT WAS GOING TO GET SHOT DOWN. WE HAD A 100% OF IT I HAD TO CREATE A NEW BUSINESS PLAN IN TWENTY FOUR HOURS I HAD TO CREATE A NEW BUSINESS MODEL WE DIDN'T HAVE GORD ASH CONTRACTS. I DIDN'T HAVE A- ONLINE SET UP OR TAKE AWAY WE DIDN'T HAVE AN ONLINE MENU. I HAVE A FRENCH CHEF HUSBAND WHO IS VERY MUCH A LOGICAL IT IS VERY INTENSE VERY FOCUSED MASTER WHAT HE DOES AND HE HAD TO CREATE ITS MENU MODIFY HIS MENU. FOR WHAT COULD BE ENJOYED AT HOME OUT OF A TO GO BOX. WE LET SOME OF OUR STAFF GO- AND WE HAD CONVERSATIONS WE HAVE A SMALL STAFF WE ONLY HAVE EIGHTEEN EMPLOYEES. WE HAD SEVERAL THAT DID NOT WANT TO WORK. THEY WANTED TO STAY HOME THEY VOLUNTEERED TO STAY HOME. AND WE KEPT THE REST OF EVERYONE WORKING. WE WERE VERY BLESSED WHERE IN THE LAFAYETTE COMMUNITY AND- I MAINTAIN AN EMAIL LIST OF OVER FOUR THOUSAND OF OUR GUESTS. AND I'M VERY ACTIVE WITH THEM AND I SENT OUT EMAILS EVERY WEEK. AND WE SENT OUT AN EMAIL AND WE SAID WE'RE MAKING LEMONADE OUT OF LEMONS. AND HERE'S OUR TODO MENU AND THE LAFAYETTE COMMUNITY STEPPED UP. THE CITY OF LAFAYETTE STEPPED UP. THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WAS IMMENSELY HELPFUL. AND THEN WE GET INTO OUR COUNTY. AND EVEN IN OUR STATE. THE GUIDANCE WAS HORRIBLE COMMUNICATION WAS HORRIBLE. A COUPLE OF OUR COUNTY MEMBERS WOULD JOKE ON THEIR PERSONAL SOCIAL MEDIA PAGES ABOUT HAVING TO SHOP ON AMAZON. WHILE THE BUSINESSES AROUND THEM IN THEIR COUNTY WERE SHUTTING DOWN- WE HAD OTHER ONES THAT WOULD ANNOUNCE A PURSE THE FUTURE OPENING. ON THEIR SOCIAL MEDIA PAGES NOT IN AN OFFICIAL CAPACITY. AND THEN WE WOULDN'T GET ANY GUIDANCE FROM THE COUNTY UNTIL TWENTY FOUR HOURS BEFORE OR SAME DAY. SO HOW DO YOU RUN A BUSINESS HOW DO YOU MANAGE EMPLOYEES HOW DO YOU MANAGE GUESTS WHEN YOU DON'T KNOW FROM DAY TO DAY OR WEEK TO WEEK WHAT THAT BUSINESS LOOKS LIKE. AND I UNDERSTAND IT WAS AN EVER CHANGING PICTURE I EMPATHIZE WITH THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT WE HAVE A VERY GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR HEALTH INSPECTOR AND WHAT COUNTY HEALTH AS LITTLE AS WE DEAL WITH THEM WHICH IS ALWAYS A GOOD THING WHEN YOU'RE A RESTAURANT YOU GET YOUR INSPECTIONS AND EVERYONE SMILES AND THINGS GO GOOD AND THAT'S IT AND THAT'S ALL IT SHOULD BE BECAUSE- OUR MAIN PRIORITY IS KEEPING EVERYONE HEALTHY. WHITE HEALTHY AND SAFE. SO WHEN WE WERE OPEN FOR OUTDOOR AND I'M SITTING RIGHT NOW IN OUR PATIO WAS VERY BLESSED WE HAVE A HUGE OUTDOOR PATIO WE HAVE A VERY SMALL RESTAURANT INSIDE- BUT WE WERE ALLOWED TO OPEN FOR OUTDOOR DINING AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN IT SHUT DOWN AND IT'S TAKEN AWAY. AND AT THE COUNTY LEVEL WE ASKED THEM WHY WHY WHY WE PRESENTED WITH- RESEARCH THAT WAS SHOWING OTHER STUDIES IN OTHER COUNTRIES THAT WERE DONE THAT WERE SHOWING THAT IT WASN'T GETTING SPREAD IN OUTDOOR DINING. AND WE WERE JUST TOLD THIS IS WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH IT CAN YOU PROVIDE US DATA YOU'RE SHUTTING OUR BUSINESS DOWN YOU'RE LETTING PEOPLE SHOP AT COSTCO YOU'RE DOING ALL THESE THINGS. AND SO TO REACH BACK TO THAT POINT OF WHERE IS THIS DATA. WE COULDN'T GET THE ATA AND AS BUSINESS OWNERS WE UNDERSTAND THAT EVERYONE STRUGGLING WITH TRYING TO MAKE SENSE OF ALL OF THIS. BUT POLICIES SEEM TO JUST BE MADE ON A WHIM AND THEN WE'RE LOOKING AT POLITICAL OFFICIALS WHO AREN'T FOLLOWING THE POLICIES AND THE GUIDANCE THAT THEY'RE PUTTING INTO PLACE. THAT WE CAN GET SHUT DOWN FOR AND FIND THAT WE'RE GETTING THREATENED TO LOSE OUR BUSINESS TO GET FINED IF AND WHEN THESE THINGS HAPPEN. AND THEN WE'RE SEEING LEADING OFFICIALS NOT FOLLOWING THE SAME GUIDELINES. YOU KNOW AT THE SAME TIME OUR THREE KIDS WERE OUT OF SCHOOL SO WE HAD TO SWITCH TO ONLINE LEARNING. THE BLAST AND THAT MY PARENTS ARE HERE. AND THEY COULD TAKE OVER MY CHILD CARE FOR ME. BUT RIGHT NOW WE'RE TRYING TO COME BACK. AND OUR ISSUE WITH COMING BACK AS EMPLOYEES WE HAVE THREE POSITIONS THAT ARE OPEN. THEY'VE BEEN OPEN FOR A COUPLE MONTHS NOW. AND IN THE LAST TWO WEEKS WE'VE HAD TWO PEOPLE TURNED DOWN OFFERS BECAUSE PART ISN'T RUNNING. AGAIN WE'RE A DINNER ONLY RESTAURANT WE HAVE COOKS THAT WORKED UNTIL TEN OR ELEVEN O'CLOCK AT NIGHT. AND WE HAVE EMPLOYEES THEY'RE NOT LIVING IN LAFAYETTE THEY DON'T LIVE IN A WIND UP THEY DON'T LIVE ALONG THE CREEK THEY LIVE IN OAKLAND AND BERKELEY IN PITTSBURG AND BAY POINT. A LOT OF THEM RELY ON PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION AND THERE'S NO PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION RIGHT NOW. THE OTHER SITUATION THAT WE HAVE. IS IN JANUARY WE. HAD A MINIMUM WAGE HIKE WAIT A MINUTE. AND LET ME TELL YOU MY MINIMUM WAGE EMPLOYEE IS MY HIGHEST HOURLY PAID EMPLOYEES THAT'S MY TIPPED EMPLOYEE. WELL I CAN'T FIND A COOK. BECAUSE ALREADY ON THAT 45% LABOR COST BECAUSE FEES KEEP GOING UP UNEMPLOYMENT RATES GO UP AND WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN TWO YEARS WHEN THE STATE REALIZES THEY DON'T HAVE ANY MORE UNEMPLOYMENT MONEY JUST LIKE THE PREVIOUS TIME WHEN THEY RAN OUT OF UNEMPLOYMENT MONEY THEY'RE GONNA COME ASKING ME FOR MONEY. I WROTE A FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLAR CHECK WHEN WE FIRST OPENED THE RESTAURANT BECAUSE THE STATE BASICALLY FIND SMALL BUSINESSES ARE RUNNING OUT OF UNEMPLOYMENT FINDS. SO I'M LOOKING FORWARD AND I'M LOOKING AHEAD TO THAT. SO THAT MINIMUM WAGE HIKE WHICH COULD HAVE NOT BEEN PUT INTO PLACE. IT HAD ALL OF THE REASONS WHY IT SHOULDN'T BE I KNOW THAT CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION HEAVILY ADVOCATED FOR IT NOT TO YOU. IT DIDN'T GET PUT IN PLACE. SO NOW MY PAYROLL HAS INCREASED BY 3% BECAUSE AGAIN MY HIGHEST PAID HOURLY EMPLOYEES JUST GOT A RAISE BUT THE GOVERNMENT FORCED ME TO GIVE THEM. AND THAT'S LESS LABOR DOLLARS THAT I CAN PAY MY COOKS WHO LEFT THE STATE WHO WENT TO OTHER INDUSTRIES. SO LOOKING FORWARD TO MY HANDS ARE TIED. SO WE'RE TRYING TO FIND CREATIVE WAYS- WE TRY AND OFFER WORK LIFE BALANCE ONLY BEING OPEN FIVE DAYS A WEEK PEOPLE SAY WILL OPEN FOR SUNDAY BRUNCH. I DESERVE A LIFE TOO YOU KNOW WE WOULD GET THESE REGULATIONS ON A FRIDAY THE GOVERNOR WOULD ANNOUNCE HERE'S THIS WONDERFUL PROGRAM TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT. SEED SENIORS WILL HOST RESTAURANTS GET MONEY THESE ARE ALL THESE PROGRAMS HERE'S THE NUMBER TO CALL. SO WHAT I'D CALL THE NUMBER. AND I WAS TOLD WE DON'T HAVE ANY INFORMATION ABOUT IT THE GOVERNMENT DOESN'T WORK ON WEEKENDS CALL BACK NEXT FRIDAY MAYBE WE'LL HAVE SOME INFORMATION FOR YOU. SO PROGRAMS WERE BEING OFFERED WE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF SOME WE WERE GRATEFUL FOR ALL OF THE EFFORT. BUT YOU'RE ANNOUNCING PROGRAMS WITHOUT THEM BEING DEVELOPED. AND IT JUST FELTLIKE EVERY DAY THERE WAS A NEW REGULATION A NEW DECISION AND IT JUST GOT REALLY OVERWHELMING WE BAGS FOR CLARITY FROM OUR COUNTY I STEPPED ON SO MANY SPAM CALLS BAKING AND BAKING MORE THAN TWENTY FOUR HOURS NOTICE PLEASE. AND THAT NEVER HAPPENED. SO I'M HOPEFUL WE DO HAVE A BEAUTIFUL PATIO RIGHT NOW WE'RE VERY BLESSED WE'RE BUSIER THAN EVER WE DID KEEP MOST OF OUR STAFF SO WE'RE NOT TOO SHORT STAFFED- BUT AT THE SAME TIME I'M A LITTLE HESITANT BECAUSE WE DO NEED THOSE STAFF. AND WE DO NEED TO GET THEM WORKING. SO I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME I THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING US TO SPEAK AND- WHAT THAT ALL ALL LANDS AND WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY AND IF IT'S ANY CONSOLATION I'D MUCH RATHER BE ON YOUR PATIO. THE HEARING THIS COMMITMENT TODAY WEARING A MASK IS SO LAST BUT CERTAINLY NOT LEAST. FOR SOME PERSPECTIVE FROM THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY I WILL HEAR FROM GREG TOOL AND- WHO IS THE OWNER OF DYLAN SOUL FOOD KITCHEN- AND I'M ASSUMING MR DOING FROM YOUR YOUR- SOON ALL IT RESTAURANT ALSO HOT FIELD- AND- MR DOING BRINGS UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE TO US TODAY DESCRIBED HIS EXPERIENCE WHICH IS FITTING. IN THE STATE'S PANDEMIC PROMPTED GREAT PLACE TO LIVE. IN PROGRAM FOR SENIORS. WELCOME GOOD AFTERNOON SERVICE AND HONOR TO BE HERE TODAY. THANK YOU ALL FOR INVITING ME. MY NAME IS GREG DILLON AND I AM A SECOND GENERATION. RESTAURANT OWNER MY FAMILY STARTED WITH A LITTLE HAMBURGER STAND. OR MARLIES KING BOULEVARD IN LOS ANGELES. AND TODAY WE CURRENTLY OPERATES THREE. SOUL FOOD SOUTHERN STAR RESTAURANTS. AND KNEW HOW TO BUILD A- NATIONAL CHICKEN RESTAURANT CALLED CHICKEN. I THERE WE JUST TOLD UP ABOUT TWO MONTHS BEFORE PANDEMIC HIT I SHOULD ADD. AND THEN WE AND WE ALSO OPERATE TWO FOOD TRUCKS AND SO- YOU KNOW WHEN. THINGS STARTED TO GET BACK WITH THE PANDEMIC- THE RESTAURANTS WERE HIT PRETTY HARD AND SOFT HE REALLY SHARP DECLINE IN OUR REVENUES. IN THE LOT A BIG PART OF MY BUSINESS IS CATERING. AND NOBODY TALKS ABOUT- THE CATERERS AND CATERING BUSINESSES OUT THERE BUT MY CATERING BUSINESS. WAS WIPED OUT 1100% AND SO- YOU KNOW WE KNEW WE HAD TO KILL IT. BEING IN BUSINESS FOR FIFTY YEARS WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH A LOT. AND SO WE KNOW HOW TO SURVIVE. AND SO- WE STARTED LOOKING FOR OTHER OPPORTUNITIES AND IT SEEMS LIKE ALMOST IMMEDIATELY. AFTER THINGS STARTED SHUTTING DOWN I GOT AN EMAIL FROM THE EIGHTH COUNCIL DISTRICT HERE IN LOS ANGELES SEEKING RESTAURANTS. TO SERVE MEALS TO SENIORS AND EIGHT COUNCIL DISTRICT BECAUSE OF SENIOR MEAL CENTERS SENIOR CENTERS ARE SHUTTING DOWN. AND THEY WANTED TO SENIORS TO CONTINUE GETTING THEIR MEALS. AND SO WE WENT. FROM SERVING SOUL FOOD DINNERS IN THE RESTAURANT ONE DAY. TO DELIVERING SENIOR MEALS DOOR TO DOOR THE NEXT DAY FOR THE EIGHTH COUNCIL DISTRICT. AND IT WAS QUITE A QUITE A CHANGE IN THIS IT WAS KIND OF FUN BECAUSE YOU KNOW I HAD MY OWN ROUTE. AND AS I WOULD GO UP TO DELIVER THE MEALS MYSELF I KNEW EVERYBODY I WAS DELIVERING TO. AND SO- THAT WAS A GOOD WAY TO CONNECT WITH MY WITH MY CUSTOMERS. BUT THOSE FUNDS SOON% RAN OUT AND ANNA AND I HAVE TO MANDATE COUNCIL DISTRICT BECAUSE THEY REPURPOSE FUNDS. FROM ONE LITTLE PROJECT PURPOSE TO THIS MEAL. PROGRAM AND HE DID IT REALLY FAST. THE THOSE PHONES RAN OUT. AND WEEKS WE WERE ABLE TO TRANSITION AND IN LOS ANGELES WE CALL WE CALL IT THE MAYOR'S GREAT PLAINS SENIOR MEAL PROGRAM- WE WERE PICKED UP BY THE MAYOR'S GREAT PLACE THE EMAIL PROGRAM. AND AGAIN THIS WAS A PROGRAM TO PROVIDE MEALS TO SENIORS IN LOS ANGELES. WHO HAVE TO DEAL WITH SEVERE FOOD IN SECURITIES- IN SEOUL IN S. THERE'S A BIG. PROBLEM IN SOUTH LOS ANGELES OUR RESTAURANTS OPERATED IN IN FOOD DESERTS. AND THERE'S TREMENDOUS FOOD. IN BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES. ESPECIALLY FOR SENIOR CITIZENS. AND SO WERE VERY HONORED TO HAVE BEEN SELECTED TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT PROGRAM. BECAUSE I'VE ALWAYS BEEN THE PERSON WHO LIKES TO GIVE BACK TO MY COMMUNITY- BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT AND IT IS SOMETHING THAT I LOVE TO DO- THE WAY THE GREAT PLAINS PROGRAM WAS. DESIGNED IN LOS ANGELES. IT WAS A IT WAS A COLLABORATION BETWEEN. THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES DEPARTMENT OF AGING. LOCAL RESTAURANTS IN THE YELLOW CAB COMPANY. R. OVER TIME WE DEVELOPED A REALLY GOOD WORKING RELATIONSHIP AND RELEASE LAWLESS SYSTEM. DEPARTMENT OF AGING WOULD. THEY DEVELOPED A LIST OF SENIORS. CAN B. IN TURN GAVE THAT LISTS THE YELLOW CAB COMPANY. THEN DESIGNED A ROUTE. OR DIFFERENT ROUTES IN THE ASSIGNED CABS TO THE DIFFERENT RESTAURANTS TO DELIVER THOSE MEALS. AND SO WE HAD YOU KNOW BETWEEN FORTY AND FIFTY RESTAURANTS YOU KNOW EACH RESTAURANT YOU KNOW HAVING SIX OR SEVEN OR EIGHT CATS COMING ON YOU KNOW TO PICK UP MEALS. AND HE WAS REALLY GOOD OUR RELATIONSHIP- IT WAS VERY ORGANIZED. IT WAS VERY. IMPACTFUL BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY IT WAS STILL IS LIFE SUSTAINING IT SUSTAIN MY BUT IT'S SAVED MY BUSINESS- WE WERE ABLE TO. MAINTAIN OUR OUR STAFF WITHOUT HAVING TO LAY PEOPLE OFF- THIS ALSO HELPED US TO KEEP OUR RESTAURANT OPEN- BECAUSE WE OPERATED A FOOD DESERT THERE NOT A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY THEY'RE NOT A LOT OF RESOURCES OF PLACES FOR PEOPLE TO GET MEALS IN SOUTH LOS ANGELES SO A LOT OF OUR CUSTOMERS COME TO DO MS. TWO OR HOT CHICKEN. TO GET THEIR DAILY MEAL I MEAN IT'S- YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT THAT MUCH OF A SPECIAL OCCASION TYPE OF RESTAURANT. BUT WE SERVE COMFORT FOOD YOU KNOW FRIED CHICKEN AND MASHED POTATOES AND STUFF WARMER AND STUFF LIKE THAT. SO PEOPLE COME A LITTLE LITERALLY COME TO US. TO GET THEIRS THE DAILY MEAL SO OUR OUR OUR FOOD MODEL OUR BUSINESS MODEL. IS THAT OF A CAFETERIA STYLE RESTAURANT- THEMSELF CALLING THE MEETING TO MEDIUM THREE. FOURTEEN AT THREE SITES WHATEVER. IN OUR CUSTOMERS TYPICALLY COME IN GET THEIRMEAL WE SERVE LARGE PORTIONS. AND SO THEY TAKE THAT HOME. TO THEIR FAMILIES TO FEED THEIR FAMILIES. AND SO WE WERE ABLE TO SURVIVE. BECAUSE OF OUR BUSINESS MODEL AND BECAUSE OF THE GREAT PLAINS PROGRAM. B. GRADE PLATES PROGRAM WAS VERY POPULAR HERE IN LOS. THERE WASN'T A DAY WHEN I WAS OUT WHEN I WILL BE OUT IN PUBLIC TO SOMEONE DIDN'T STOP ME ASKME HOW THEY COULD GET THEIR POWER CUT HOW WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE. FOR THEM TO GET THEIR MOTHER OR THEIR RELATIVES ON THE MEAL PROGRAM EVERYBODY KNEW ABOUT- IT'S A- IT'S SATAN THE RESTAURANTS ALL THE RESTAURANTS INVOLVED WERE EXTREMELY GRATEFUL. THE TAXI DRIVERS WHO DELIVER THE MEALS WERE EXTREMELY GRATEFUL. THIS IS A VERY VERY POSSIBLE PROGRAM IN IN IN HI YOU KNOW LEGAL- FORTUNATELY DID TO THANK THE MAYOR PERSONALLY FOR. PROGRAM BECAUSE IT SAVES YOU KNOW SO MANY OF OUR BUSINESS. SANDED THE TAXI DRIVERS THE TAXI DRIVERS WERE EXTREMELY APPRECIATIVE OF THE PROGRAM BECAUSE THE CEILINGS THIS GAVE THEM WORK. I'M JUST GIVING THEM MORE. AND SO THE MEAL PROGRAM IS VERY POPULAR. WAS VERY POSITIVE OKAY REVENUE FLOWING INTO OUR POCKETS AND IT LITERALLY SAVED OUR BUSINESS I BELIEVE- YOU KNOW I REALLY LITERALLY SAVED OUR BUSINESS. AS IT RELATES TO FOOD AND SECURITY I WAS STILL A BIG PROBLEM IN SOUTH LOS ANGELES. ESPECIALLY AS IT RELATES TO POOR ESPECIALLY AS IT RELATES TO SENIORS. THE GREAT PLACE PROGRAM HAS ENDED. WELL THE NEED HAS NOT ENDED AND IN FACT JUST THIS MORNING AS I WAS PREPARING FOR TODAY CBS AROUND STORY ABOUT FOOD SECURITY IN LOS ANGELES. SPEAKING ABOUT HOW IT REALLY IMPACTS BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES AND IT TALKED ABOUT HOW THE SENIORS. SENIOR CITIZENS ARE ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE. SO I HAVE NOTHING BUT POSITIVE THINGS TO SAY ABOUT THE GREAT PLACE PROGRAM. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IT WAS WILL ORGANIZE. IT WAS A GREAT PARTNERSHIP EVERYBODY GOT ALONG. THE C. USUALLY LOADED I KNOW THEY LOVE MY FOOD I GOT FEEDBACK. AND YOU KNOW I JUST I'M JUST SORRY WE WERE ALL SORRY TO SEE THE FUNDING RIGHT NOW. GRANAHAN AND WE REALLY WISH NOT ALL ALL PARTIES INVOLVED RESTAURANTS CAN THE CAB DRIVERS IN THE SENIORS WHICH DID IT COULD HAVE BEEN EXTENDED A LITTLE BIT LONGER. BUT I WAS VERY PROUD TO BE A PART OF THE PROGRAM AND BE ABLE TO GIVE BACK TO THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES. HAS SUPPORTED ME OVER THE YEARS. SAW THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR GIVING ME THIS OPPORTUNITY TO EXPRESS MY FEELINGS. AND I GIVE YOU MY PERSPECTIVE AND THANK YOU MISTER DONUT AND THANK YOU TO ALL OF THE PANELISTS- IT'S WITH THIS POINT I'D DIE WE WILL OPEN IT UP TO QUESTIONS. FROM MY COLLEAGUE SENATOR ROB PLEASE.

DURING THIS RATHER DIFFICULT TIME THANK YOU MR THANK YOU THANK YOU CENTER THE CENTER BASED I JUST WANT TO ECHO ON THE COMMENTS OF THE GOOD A COLLEAGUE FROM RIVERSIDE- ESPECIALLY TO THIS GROUP WHO ARE ON THE FRONT LINES WHEN THE PANDEMIC CAT I THINK THE THING THAT STAND STOOD OUT THE MOST TO ME DURING THAT TIME WAS THE OPENING AND THEN THE SHUT DOWN OF THE RESTAURANTS AND I THINK MR TOWNSHIP. TOWN HALL SPOKE OF THAT AS HIS PREACHER DID ALSO AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE THE RUBBER HITS THE ROAD ON I'M NOT BELIEVING THAT ANY OF THIS WAS DONE WITH REAL SCIENCE AND YET OUR STATE WAS REALLY CHAMPIONING THE FACT THAT ALL OF THE REGULATIONS THAT WE'RE GOING OUT WE'RE BASED ON SCIENCE AND THAT THERE WAS A LOT OF TRANSPARENCY WITHOUT SO I THINK WE NEED TO AGAIN FOCUS ON THAT GOING FORWARD- IF WE ARE GOING TO GET THE DATA THAT MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SPOKEN OF AND I THINK THAT'S BEEN ALL ON OUR MINDS ALL OF US. DURING THIS HEARING IT IS ESSENTIAL IF WE'RE GOING TO BUILD TRUST BACK INTO OUR PUBLIC HEALTH DELIVERY SYSTEM IN THE COMMUNICATIONS- FROM- THAT SECTOR ODD TO THE PUBLIC THAT SO WHAT REALLY WAS LACKING WHEN WE WERE SUPPOSED TO WEAR A MASK AND THEN WE DIDN'T HAVE TO WEAR UNDER A I GUESS IT WAS WE DIDN'T HAVE TO WEAR AND THEN WE'RE SUPPOSED TO WEAR AMID EVERYTHING THAT FOLLOWED IN THE ON THE ON ON THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY IN PARTICULAR. OF THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY WAS SHUT DOWN BECAUSE OF SCIENCE AND WE NOW HAVE LEARNED IN THIS HEARING THAT IT REALLY WAS MORE ANECDOTAL OR SPLIT STUFF PROBABLY TOO SIMPLISTIC BUT IT BASICALLY WAS MORE TO DO WITH HOW THE VIRUS WAS ACTING VERSUS HOW WAS ACTUALLY BEING TRANSMITTED ESPECIALLY ON AEROSOL OUTDOORS SO I THINK THIS HAS BEEN GREAT- TO REALLY HONE IN ON SPECIFICS I HAVE TO SEE THE GREAT PLATE SUBPROGRAM WAS. WONDERFUL IN ORANGE COUNTY ALL ESPECIALLY FOR ONE OF THE SENIOR SENIOR MEMBERS IN MY FAMILY WHO IS BENEFIT WHO BENEFITED FROM. IT SO THAT YOU HAVE SOME I'VE BEEN GOING FOR- SENATOR.

FOR THE BUSINESS BUT ALSO HAD A PASSION FOR SERVING OTHERS. AND IT AGAIN THOUGH YOU KNOW THE RESTAURANT. SPACE OCCUPIES REPLACING ALL OF OUR HEARTS AND DEFINES IN MANY WAYS OUR COMMUNITIES.

IN WE MENTALLY ENGAGED- AND EDUCATIONAL OUTREACH TO OUR LICENSEES ARE MAKING SURE THAT THEY WERE AWARE THAT THE RELIEF AVAILABLE TO THEM. WE ALSO HAD- UP TO DATE PAGES ON OUR PUBLIC WEBSITE THAT DESCRIBED THE RELIEF AVAILABLE TO EACH SPECIFIC LICENSE TIED.

AND THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. AND THANK YOU DIRECTOR ROCKS OUR NEXT PRESENTER TODAY IS LAURIE THOMAS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE SAN FRANCISCO BASED GOLDEN GATE RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION. WHICH IS A NONPROFIT TRADE ORGANIZATION FOCUSED ON HELPING PAY OR RESTAURANTS SURVIVE AND THRIVE MISS THOMAS IS ALSO A MEMBER OF SAN FRANCISCO'S ECONOMIC RECOVERY TASK FORCE. WELCOME IS THOMAS. BYE THANK YOU EVERYBODY AND I'D LIKE TO JUST REITERATE. WHAT SO MANY PEOPLE UPSET TODAY- I ALSO- HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE A RESTAURANT OWNER MYSELF AND HAVE TWO RESTAURANTS IN SAN FRANCISCO SO I HAVE THE UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK. NOT ONLY AS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THESE PAST FIFTEEN MONTHS AT THE GOLDEN GATE RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION- BUT ALSO IT'S TWENTY FIVE YEARS PLUS- AS A RESTAURANT OWNER A CCI RESTAURANTS NEIGHBORHOOD RESTAURANTS IN SAN FRANCISCO SO I FEEL THE PAIN. PERSONALLY AS WELL AS FOR THE REST OF ALL OF OUR- COLLEAGUES IN THIS INDUSTRY- AND WHILE WE ARE NOT A CHAPTER OF THE C. R. A. I WANT TO THANK MATT SUTTON AND JOT CONDIE FOR ALL THE WORK THEY DO IS WE TRY TO HELP. ELEVATE THEIR VOICES AND OUR VOICES ARE OUT OF STATE AND- CERTAINLY AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL- IN THE INTEREST OF TIME- THAT WE ALL KNOW WHAT HAS HAPPENED AND I WANT TO REITERATE IT I WANTED TO JUST LEAVE. FIVE THINGS THAT I THINK ARE REALLY CRITICAL NOW. AS YOU MOVE FORWARD AND I HESITATE TO SAY THAT WE'RE IN A POST AT A RECOVERY STATE BECAUSE I AS THE REST OF YOU KNOW WE'RE ALL AT AND SO I DON'T FEEL THAT WERE OR WERE POST PANDEMIC YET BUT WE'RE STILL IN THE MIDST OF IT BUT HOPEFULLY MOVING FORWARD. AND HERE ARE I THINK THE FIVE CRITICAL THINGS THAT WE NEED GOING FORWARD. NUMBER ONE IS. I PERSONALLY- I DO NOT KNOW WHAT'S GOING HAPPEN TO FIFTEEN. AND I AM CONCERNED BUT PERHAPS- IT WON'T BE A FULL RETURN TO NORMALITY AND I'M I'M MAKING A STRONG CALL OUT I WILL REITERATE THIS. WITH OUR HEALTH OFFICER IN SAN FRANCISCO AS WELL AS CONTRACTS AT THE STATE LEVEL- THAT WOULD BE GREAT IF THE STATE COULD ARTICULATE. WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN ON JUNE FIFTEENTH IN REGARDS TO INDOOR DINING. AND WHAT'S GOING TO BE REQUIRED I HAVE A REAL FEAR. THAT IT MAY BE A RETURN TO QUOTE A 100% CAPACITY BUT ONLY IF WE SAY- YOU KNOW COMMIT TO FULL VACCINATED CUSTOMERS. BECOME THE POLICE TO CHECK THE CARDS THAT THAT TYPE OF THING THAT. PERSONALLY FOR MY TWO NEIGHBORHOOD RESTAURANTS ESPECIALLY RUNNING SHORT STAFFED WITH NO POSTS- IS GOING TO BE JUST A NIGHTMARE AND I CAN'T EVEN BEGIN TO IMAGINE WHAT IT'LL BE FOR FOLKS THAT HAVE. OUT OF STATE CUSTOMERS AS MARK THERE. AS MORE OF THEIR CLIENTELE SO I WOULD REQUEST WE HAVE THIRTY DAYS- AND I WOULD REQUEST AT LEAST A WEEK IF NOT TO WHERE YOU STAY LAURIE IF THIS IS THE BAD NEWS HERE'S THE BAD NEWS TELL ALL YOUR MEMBERS. OR IF THIS IS THE GOOD NEWS GREAT WE HAVE TIME TO START HIRING AND- AND MOVING BACK FORWARD SO I JUST WANT TO REITERATE. THE MORE INFORMATION THE SOONER THE POSSIBLE WHETHER IT'S WHAT WE WANT TO HEAR OR NOT WE'RE ALL ADULTS AND WE NEED TO HEAR THAT SO THAT'S MIGHT LIKE. REALLY STRONG REQUEST AND WE'VE DONE A GREAT JOB IN SAN FRANCISCO. THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY TASK FORCE- THAT WE CONVENED IN APRIL WITH EIGHTY DIFFERENT. INDUSTRY FOLKS CITY FOLKS. FAITH LEADERS ACTIVISTS ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT- FOLKS WITH OUR GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS. REALLY LET US BIND TOGETHER AND FORGE REAL WORKING RELATIONSHIPS. BUT LET US COMMUNICATE CLEARLY WHAT WE NEED AND WORK AS PARTNERS AND I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE REALLY PROUD OF IN SAN FRANCISCO GOING FORWARD AND HAS BEN. SUPER POSITIVE FOR MYSELF PERSONALLY AS WELL. THE SECOND THING THAT I REALLY THINK THAT- WE NEED IN. ADDITION TO CLARITY AND JUST REITERATE AND WHAT ERIC AND EVERYONE ELSE HAS BEEN ABLE TO SAY DO HERE. THE KIND. OF THE USE OF THE OUTSIDE SPACES WE CALL IT THE SHARED SPACES PROGRAM IN SAN FRANCISCO- THAT- YOU KNOW FOR SITTING ON SIDEWALKS CONTINUING THE PARK WHAT'S CONTINUING MAYBE SOME OF THE SHARED- STREETS CONTINUING. AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE WORK SENATOR DODD AND SENATOR WINNER OF DONE- WITH- EIGHTY THREE EIGHTY NINE AND EIGHTY THREE FOURTEEN. AND ALLOWING AND PUTTING FORTH WE HELP OUT WHICH PASSES THE THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE DAYS TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE A. B. C. ON. HOW TO EXTEND TO MOVE FORWARD THESE PERMITS SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALL THAT WORK ERIC IN YOUR TEAM. AND SENATOR DODD AT AS WELL. THE THIRD THING THAT I THINK THAT WE REALLY NEED AND I THINK YOU GUYS ARE ALL WHERE THIS AND I'VE BEEN. SITTING ON THE LEADERSHIP COUNCIL OF INDEPENDENT RESTAURANT COALITION AS WELL AS WE DESPERATELY NEED MORE MONEY. IN TERMS OF RELIEF TO THE RESTAURANT ORGANIZATION WHAT MANY OF US ARE CLIMBED OUT OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS OF LOSSES- AND THAT WHICH THE PPP PROGRAMS WERE INSTRUMENTAL IN HELPING. US EVEN BE ALIVE- IF YOU WANT TO BE TO AND I AGAIN I THINK THE STATE FOR ALLOWING US TO DEDUCT RPP ONE EXPENSES- FOR CERTAIN FOLKS A QUALIFIED I KNOW NOT EVERYBODY DID BUT- FOR US. THIS WAS A BIG A BIG HELP ME PERSONALLY IT WAS A BIG HELP. I HAVE SIXTY FIVE EMPLOYEE I HAD SIXTY FIVE EMPLOYEES OF MY TWO RESTAURANTS WERE DOWN TO NOW ABOUT 85% OF THAT- WE HELPED YOU. TO ADD BACK UP BUT THAT'S ANOTHER THING SO MORE RELIEF AND ALSO RELEASED ITS REAL I PERSONALLY. APPRECIATE BEING TOLD TWO MONTHS AGO THAT I QUALIFIED FOR A TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR. CALIFORNIA RELIEF GRANT AND FOR THE LIFE OF ME NOBODY CAN TELL ME HOW I SEE THAT MONEY O HOW I GET THAT MONEY. SUPER FRUSTRATING NOT OKAY- AND I KNOW THAT THAT IS SOMETHING I'M NOT SURE WHAT'S HAPPENING BUT- THE RELIEF NEEDS TO BE REAL AND IT'S- NOT JUST A PR- GROUPS- BUT IT HAS TO BE REAL. SO THAT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO DO WE NEED MORE R. F. FUNDS IF YOU ALL CONNECTED IN WASHINGTON. PLEASE WHATEVER IT TAKES PLEASE WE SAW A SIXTY BILLION DOLLARS I BELIEVE IN THE FIRST WEEK IN TERMS OF APPLICATION NAMED. AN S. TWENTY EIGHT POINT SIX BILLION. ARM IN CRIMES ND EVEN THE MINORITY GROUPS ARE PROBABLY NOT GONNA ALL GET THE APPS THAT WERE REQUESTED. THE NEXT THING AND THIS CAME OUT OF A DISCUSSION WITH OUR FRIENDS AT THE R. C. TODAY I THINK THIS WOULD BE AWESOME. AS IF THERE'S ANY WAY WE CAN ALL LOBBIED TO EXTEND THE EMPLOYEE RETENTION TAX CREDITS. BEYOND THE END OF THIS YEAR BECAUSE THAT REALLY HELPS US. TO PAY OUR WORKERS MORE AND BRING BACK MORE WORKERS AND IT'S BEEN AN INCREDIBLY HELPFUL PROGRAM. I KNOW AGAIN THAT SAID THAT THE STATE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL BUT IF ANYTHING WE CAN DO AND IF THERE'S A SIMILAR PROGRAM AT THE STATE LEVEL WE COULD CREATE THAT WOULD BE AWESOME AS WELL. I LOVED MATH IDEA ABOUT A- A BONUS STIMULUS THAT PEOPLE COME BACK TO WORKI THOUGHT THAT WAS pAWESOME- AND THEN I THINK THE- BEST THING I WANNA SAY. IS REALLY REITERATING ON WORKING TOGETHER AND CLARITY. AND MY WHOLE JOB THE PAST. FIFTEEN MONTHS HAS BEEN TRYING TO HELP EVERYBODY SURVIVE AND TRY TO INTERPRET. OR AS DR. AND I'D LIKE TO TALK. HOW TO OPERATE. ALL OF THE GUIDANCE SO THERE IS A HUNDRED AND- TWENTY PAGE HELP ORDER WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IN REALITY I MEAN AND THAT. THINGS LIKE HEY CAN WE PUT SALT PEPPER SHAKERS BACK OUT THINGS THAT. THINGS THAT DOCTORS DON'T DON'T THINK ABOUT BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT RESTAURANT OPERATORS AND- AND SO WE NEED TO CONTINUE THAT DIALOGUE AND WE NEED TO BE ADULTS ABOUT IT WE NEED TO PUSH BACK AND WE NEED TO SAY THAT'S A GOOD IDEA BUT THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS IN REALITY. OR YOU KNOW. EVEN IF YOU DON'T GET RID OF SIX FOOT DISTANCING- TO LAURA'S POINT THERE'S NO WAY TO GET MORE PEOPLE ARE AS YOU. THINK IT WAS LAURA THEY ARE JENNIFER'S POINT THERE THERE'S NO WAY TO GET MORE PEOPLE IN THE RESTAURANT. SO WORK WITH WORK WITH INDUSTRY LEADERS WORK WITH ALL THE RESTAURANT TOURS- WERE VERY LOGICAL PEOPLE WE WERE HAPPY TO. HELP AND PUSH BACK. AND I JUST WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY R. FOR FIGHTING TO HELP SAVE OUR INDUSTRY IT IS SO CRITICAL ROSES CAFE. IT'S BEEN THERE FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS. AND BEEN THERE FOR FIFTEEN YEARS- AND YOU KNOW IT'S NOT A GIVEN THAT WE'RE GOING TO SURVIVE JUST BECAUSE WE GO BACK TO A 100% CAPACITY I JUST WANT TO REITERATE WHAT LAURA SAID WE'RE ALL DIGGING OUT. FROM SO MUCH- FOR THE PAST FIFTEEN MONTHS WE NONE OF US MADE MONEY- PEOPLE THAT WE'RE SETTING THESE LAWS STILL TOOK SALARIES STILL HAD HEALTH INSURANCE STILL WERE ABLE TO. FEED THEIR FAMILIES AND OUR INDUSTRY WAS NOT. AND SO WE NEED TO TRY TO HELP STILL GETTING MONEY BACK INTO OUR INDUSTRY. AND REALIZE THAT- BUT THAT THIS IS A CRITICAL THING TO STILL FOCUS ON IT WE'RE NOT OUT OF THE WOODS YET YOU ALL AND IF WE CAN GET MORE INFORMATION ABOUT JUNE FIFTEENTH. THAT'LL HELP US FOR THE WEDDINGS RECEPTIONS AND EVEN TO JUST KNOW I'M NOT GOING TO BRING BACK TWO OR THREE MORE PEOPLE. ARE THEY GONNA SAY WILL LOWER YOUR GOOD NAME YOU'RE THE NEW LIKE YOU KNOW I. D. POLICE AND I'M GONNA SAY THAT DOESN'T WORK FOR US- WERE NOT THE WARRIORS WERE NOT JOE LAKE UP WE DON'T HAVE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO DO THAT AND- YOU KNOW WE DON'T RUN. GATES WHERE WE GONNA GO THROUGH AND CHECK EVERYBODY IS JUST NOT GONNA WORK SO. IF WE'RE NOT GOING TO GO TO A FREE RETURN WE JUST REALLY WANT COMMUNICATION WITH AS MUCH LEAD TIME AS POSSIBLE AND- THANK YOU ALL FOR EVERYTHING YOU'RE DOING AND I'M ALWAYS AVAILABLE TO TRY TO HELP IN ANY WAY- THANK YOU. AND I THANK YOU SO IT MISSED ALWAYS SAY AND I DO APPRECIATE. ALL OF YOUR INPUT BUT ESPECIALLY THE LAST ONE WAY WITH REGARD TO THE NEED FOR CLARITY ESPECIALLY AS WE GET. TO JUNE FIFTEENTH SO. ASSEMBLYWOMAN OR WHEN I CHEER AT WHAT IS NOW WE BUY WEEKLY CALL WITH THE GOVERNOR'S STAFF. AND THAT WILL BE THE FIRST QUESTION. ON THIS COMING MONDAY'S CALL THE ASKED FOR THANK YOU SO MUCH AND I WORKED WITH DOCTOR ERAGON SO I'M HAPPY. TO TALK ANYBODY WANTS MORE. THANK YOU DO YOU DO APPRECIATE THAT AND- WE ARE NOW. DOWN TO THE FINAL. THE AFTERNOON- MCCALL WHO'S THE FOUNDER BECAME A MUST. AND ALSO THE HISTORY IS A PREVIOUS. CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION- AND IT IS A SMALL WORLD LIFE I'VE BEEN GOING TO MR CARNEY'S. RESTAURANT HERE FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS. THAT SO IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU AND THANK YOU FOR ALL THE BRIDGES I MEAN OVER THE YEARS. AND THE- PLEASE WELCOME LOOK FOR YOUR PERSPECTIVE. AND YOUR MOOD KEVIN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENTIMENT YEAH YES OKAY- LISTEN I REALLY- APPRECIATE THIS TEAM OF PEOPLE YOU PUT TOGETHER I'M HONORED TO BE A PART OF THIS GROUP OF PEOPLE GREG I'VE I'VE KNOWN GREG FOR A LONG TIME HE SAID INCREDIBLY HARD WORKING PERSON WITH THE HARDEST WORKING PEOPLE MINISTRY JOHN TALISAY INCREDIBLE PEOPLE AND- LAURIE LAURA- AND IT WAS SOMEBODY ELSE EARLIER I GOT SO YEAH IT'S IMPRESSIVE I'VE NEVER MET YOU LADIES BUT IT'S SO IMPRESSIVE- I'M VERY LUCKY I'VE BEEN IN BUSINESS FOR THIRTY SEVEN YEARS. I OPENED POQUITO MAS BUT TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS AND- BY MYSELF AND THEN WOULD GO INTO- NINE RESTAURANTS- AND- YOU KNOW SEVERAL HUNDRED EMPLOYEES BUT I CAN TELL YOU RIGHT NOW THAT- I'M THE GREAT CAME UP WITH A GREAT COMMENT- LOOK RATHER HE HE TALKED ABOUT GRATITUDE BEING GRATEFUL FOR THE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO I FEEL GRATEFUL THAT WE'RE STILL IN BUSINESS I FEEL AND TO ALWAYS COME OUT I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG IT'S GONNA LAST. BUT I AM GRATEFUL THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO DO TO STAY IN BUSINESS AND HELP OTHERS I THINK THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY IS VERY INCLUSIVE NO MATTER WHAT WE DO WE'RE ALL HELPING EACH OTHER I'M GETTING CALLS FROM DIFFERENT RESTAURANT OPERATORS ON A WEEKLY BASIS HELPING THEM TALK THROUGH TALKING OFF THE CLIFF LET HIM KNOW THAT IT'S GOING TO THERE'S SOME HOPE WE'RE GONNA WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT AND MY COMMENTS ARE GOING TO BE VERY SHORT I KNOW THAT WE'RE SHORT ON TIME. BUT YOU KNOW THE THE REAL THING GOING FORWARD IS THAT. A COMMUNITY. IS A CRITICAL. AND I THINK. ONE WHEN YOU HAVE THE FOUR DIFFERENT LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT HAVING DIFFERENT TYPES OF COMMUNICATION. IT CREATES CONFLICT. AND IT CREATES CONFLICT BETWEEN THE CUSTOMERS AND THE EMPLOYEES BECAUSE THEY ALL FEEL LIKE THEY'VE GOT THE RIGHT INFORMATION. AND I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS. WE DON'T WANT TO DO IS WE DON'T WANT OUR FRONTLINE EMPLOYEES THAT HAVE TO BE- REGULATORS IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY'RE GONNA DO THAT FOR PEOPLE WE DON'T WANT OUR FRONTLINE EMPLOYEES WE DO NOT TRADE IT IN. AND ALTHOUGH WE TRAIN HIM SOME PORK NOT TRAINING CONFLICT RESOLUTION AND A LOT OF CONFLICT OUT THERE RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THE COMMUNICATION IS NOT GOOD IT'S NOT CONSISTENT. AND IT'S NOT NECESSARILY RELATIVE TO WHAT WE'RE DOING SO VERY IMPORTANT THAT THAT THE COMMUNICATION COMPONENT OF THIS SORRY FOR THE HANDS- THE COMMUNICATION COMPONENT IS DEALT WITH AND IF WE DO WE ARE CLEAR FOR OUR UP FRONT WE DO GIVE LEAD TIME. WE GET PROCESSING TIMES TO PEOPLE BECAUSE IT JUST SLAM SOMETHING ON PEOPLE IT CREATES PROBLEMS AND YOU SEE A LOT OF CONFLICT OUT THERE RIGHT NOW BECAUSE PEOPLE AREN'T GETTING. ENOUGH TIME TO PROCESS- INDUSTRY WISE. YOU'RE GONNA SEE A LOT OF RESTAURANTS HOBBY START CLOSING BETWEEN THREE AND FIVE CLOSE IN A COUPLE DAYS A WEEK. MAYBE EVEN MORE THAN THAT THEY COULD BECAUSE OF THE SHORTAGE OF. FOOD AND A SHORTAGE OF PEOPLE BYE I THINK THE DEEP LABOR ISSUE IS PROBABLY THE BIGGEST ISSUE FOR A LOT OF RESTAURANTS RIGHT NOW WE'VE BEEN VERY FORTUNATE WE WE'VE HELD ON TO OUR TEAM. I HAD TO CLOSE THE THAT WHEN A PARK RESTAURANT TEMPORARILY BECAUSE THIS NEXT IN ASKARI FARMAN. I WILL OPEN THAT UP AGAIN THIS SUMMER OTHERWISE WE HAVEN'T LOST ANYBODY. THE MOST IMPORTANT PART IS IT THERE'S A LADY NAMED PATTY REVELA SHE'S BEEN MY PARTNER OW- FOR MANY YEARS AND- SHE HAS BEEN OUT RUNNING THE COMPANY. FOR THE LAST FOURTEEN MONTHS. I HAVE BEEN OUT BECAUSE OF MY AGE I COULD LEAVE MY HOUSE. SO WE MET ON MY FRONT PORCH- THREE TO FIVE TIMES A WEEK TWELVE FEET APART AND SHE WOULD GO OUT AND RUN THE COMPANY. I THINK THERE'S SO MANY PATTIES OUT THERE THERE'S SO MANY STORIES ABOUT GREAT. EMPLOYEES WHO AND GREAT IN THIS CASE PARTNER WHO HAVE. REALLY CARRIED THE RESTAURANT STRIP SO MANY AND WE HAVE TO START THINKING ABOUT THOSE. BUT I THINK THAT. THE NUMBER ONE THING IS NOT ONLY DO WE NEED MORE MONEY AND IF THERE'S A SIXTY BILLION DOLLAR REQUEST AND ONLY TWENTY EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS. FIND THE OTHER THIRTY TWO. OKAY THERE'S JUST THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO REASON NOT TO FIND IT. OKAY IT'S OBVIOUS THAT EXIST FIND IT FIND IT WOULDN'T GIVE THAT. THE OTHER THING IS. THIS IS A TWO TO THREE YEAR RECOVERY. A LOT OF US HAVE EVER. WE ARE WE ARE IN THIS BUSINESS WE BELIEVE IN WHAT WE'RE DOING WE LOVE WHAT WE'RE DOING. AND IT'S NOT FOR THE MONEY. YOU KNOW IF IT WAS FOR THE MONEY WE DO SOMETHING ELSE. BUT IF WE DO LIST BECAUSE WE LOVE SERVING WE LOVE SERVING FOOD AND THE ONE THING THAT YOU CANNOT DO. IS TAKEN INTO ST HOSPITALITY- AT AND JUST LET IT GET A RACIST BECAUSE IT IS PANDEMIC MORE IMPORTANTLY. YOU HAVE SO MANY DIFFERENT. GREAT PEOPLE IN THIS INDUSTRY THAT REALLY HAVEN'T BEEN. HEARD YET SO I'M GLAD YOU'RE DOING THIS. WE NEED TO HEAR MORON. AND I CAN YOU FEEL SO. THAT TOP NOT UNDERSTAND IT THIS IS THE THREE TWO TO THREE YEAR RECOVERY PLAN. IS CRITICAL BECAUSE IT IS THAT KIND OF MONEY THAT WE'RE GONNA NEED TO HELP SUPPORT THE SMALL RESTAURANTS. THE PPP WAS FINE BUT IT WASN'T ENOUGH EVEN BOOK THAT WAS NOT ENOUGH AND I SAID TO NOT IMMEDIATELY PUT OUT THAT YES WE'RE GONNA FIND ENOUGH MONEY FOR THIS OTHER PROGRAM WE'RE GOING TO GET WHAT YOU NEED. BECAUSE WE ALL SIT HERE WITH UNCERTAINTY AND UNCERTAINTY IS WHEN WE START MAKING BAD DECISIONS WHEN WE START MAKING OKAY LATE PEOPLE LOTS OF GOING TO CLOSE THIS RESTAURANT I GOTTA CUT SOMETHING OFF. IT'S IS THAT UNCERTAINTY THAT IS CREATING A GREAT MANY PROBLEMS THAT NEED TO BE CLARIFIED. AND EVERYBODY'S POINT OF THIS WHOLE MEETING IS COMMUNICATION. IS THE KEY AND IT NEEDS TO BE GOOD AND IT NEEDS TO BE UP FRONT AND WE NEED TO HAVE PROCESSING TIME SO WE CAN DEAL WITH THINGS WE ARE.
