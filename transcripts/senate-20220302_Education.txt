ALL RIGHT LET'S BEGIN THE HEARING. THE PURPOSE OF TODAY'S HEARING IS TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW ON THE STATE'S EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION AND EXPANDED LEARNING PROGRAMS AND HOW THESE SYSTEMS MEET THE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. THE PROGRAMS WITHIN OUR EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION SYSTEM HAVE VARYING FUNDING SOURCES. REQUIREMENTS FOR STAFF. STAFFING RATIOS HOURS OF OPERATION AND FAMILY FEE STRUCTURES. THE SYSTEM IS OVERSEEN BY TWO ADMINISTERING AGENCIES. THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES AND THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. IN ADDITION OUR EXPANDED LEARNING PROGRAMS HAVE DIFFERENT SOURCES OF FUNDING AND PROGRAMMATIC REQUIREMENTS. THAN THE PROGRAMS WITHIN OUR EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION SYSTEM. BOTH PROGRAM TYPES HAVE RECEIVED A LOT OF ATTENTION DURING THE PANDEMIC. AS WE RECOGNIZE THAT CARE IS ESSENTIAL FOR KEEPING CHILDREN ENGAGED IN LEARNING. AND KEEPING THE ECONOMY RUNNING. CHILDREN LEARN AND ARE CARED FOR IN A VARIETY OF SETTINGS SUCH AS CENTERS HOME BASED CARE. AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SITES. WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND HOW THESE SYSTEMS AND PROGRAMS INTERSECT OR COMPLIMENT OR CONFLICT WITH EACH OTHER. AND HELP FAMILIES COBBLE TOGETHER A FULL DAY OF CARE AND LEARNING FOR THEIR CHILD AND CHILDREN OF DIFFERENT AGES. AS WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN EXPANDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOUNG CHILDREN TO HAVE ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY AND DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE PROGRAMS. WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT THE STATE IS SUPPORTING CHILDREN AND FAMILIES AND THE CARE AND EDUCATION INFRASTRUCTURE THAT SUPPORT THESE PROGRAMS AND STAFF. WE SHOULD DESIGN BOTH SYSTEMS WITH CHILDREN AND FAMILIES A THE CENTER AND WITH POLICIES THAT EMPOWER PARENTS AND STAFF AS EXPERTS TO BEST MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR COMMUNITIES. OR WE BEGIN WITH OUR SPEAKERS I WOULD LIKE TO INVITE THE PUBLIC WANTING TO PURSUE DISSIPATE TO CALL IN NOW. PLEASE DIAL THIS TOLL FREE NUMBER. 844-291-4185 WHEN PROMPTED. PLEASE USE THIS ACCESS CODE. FOUR SIX SIX THREE NINE SIX EIGHT NOW LET'S HEAR FROM OUR FIRST PRESENTER EDGAR CABRAL FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE MR CABRAL WELCOME PLEASE PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS AND GROUP OF ALL THE LIVES OF OUR OFFICE. I WOULD HAVE TO PROVIDE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE- THE- CHILDCARE AND EXPANDED LEARNING PROGRAMS THAT THE STATE HAS FOR SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN. WE DO NOT WE DO HAVE A HANDLE BUT I BELIEVE WAS SHARED WITH YOU AND FOR THOSE WHO ARE WATCHING- THIS ARE HEARING VIRTUALLY IT SHOULD BE AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE L. A. O. DOT CA. GOP YOU TO BE ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE OF THE PAGE I'M IN THE JUST A BRIEF- A HIGH LEVEL I KNOW THAT THERE'S A LOT OF DETAILS A STRIP. OR SOMETHING OF THE KEY ASPECTS AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER. ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE. AND SO THE FIRST PAGE OF OUR OF OUR OUT WE HAVE. A PEOPLE THAT COMPARES. THE MAJOR CHUNK OF PROGRAMS FOR SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN- AND SO WHAT HAPPENS. WHEN A TEAM OF THE FOLKS THAT I TALK ABOUT GRAHAM'S- TALKING ABOUT- PROGRAMS ARE PRIMARILY ADMINISTERED THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF. SOCIAL SERVICES AND THE PRIMARY GOAL IS. TO PROVIDE- CURRENT OPTION FOR TUCKER WHILE THEY'RE WORKING. ON WE HAVE COME TO DIFFERENT CATEGORIES OF THOSE PROGRAMS WE HAVE- CENTER BASED VOUCHER PROGRAMS- WHICH CAN BE- PRIVATE PROVIDERS- AND- COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS- THAT. THAT PROVIDES SERVICES- FAMILIES RECEIVE A VOUCHER IN THE MAKING BUT WOULD CHOOSE. WHICH PROGRAM THEY WANT THEY WANT TO ENROLL IN. A MEMBER STATE HAS DIRECT CONTRACTORS. WHICH ARE ARE PROVIDERS WHO CONTRACT DIRECTLY WITH THE STATE I'M REALLY THROUGH THE GENERAL TUCKER PROGRAM AND THEN FOR STATE PRESCHOOL THROUGH THE STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM- AND- AND- BASER ELIGIBLE CHILDREN- WHO. WHO CAN IDENTIFY DIRECTLY. ON IT AS AS YOU CAN SEE ON ON ON YOUR CHART UNDER A LOT OF SIMILARITIES. PROGRAMS THE- BASED ON CHANGES YEAR THE FIRM RAIDS ARE AS IN THE SAME THING THAT- MARKET RATES FOR EACH COUNTY. I'M THEY HAVE SIMILAR STOCK RATIO- AND THEY ARE BASED ON OUR FAMILY ELIGIBILITY AND HOURS OF CARE- THAT'S THE PRIMARY DIFFERENCE HERE IS THIS RELATED TO WHETHER IT'S- ABOUT YOUR FAMILY'S. CHOICE OVER THE PROGRAM TO GO TO OUR A DIRECT CONTRACT WITH FAMILIES ARE COMING DIRECTLY. FROM THE TEACHER QUALIFICATIONS ARE ALSO SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT AND THAT THE CONTRACT BASED- THE DRUG CONTRACTORS HAVE SOMEONE HIGHER- REQUIREMENTS FOR THE NUMBER OF. COLLEGE CREDITS AND SPECIFICALLY EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT UNITS AS WELL- UP IN THE. TWO TO BE STUCK IN THE PROGRAM. I SPEAKING ABOUT HAVING THESE PRO COMPARED THE OTHER THE SCHOOL BASED PROGRAMS I WILL TALK ABOUT IT'S ONE HUNDRED A COUPLE KEEPING- ONE OF THAT FAMILY ELIGIBILITY IS THE STARTING POINT SO IN ORDER TO BE IN ON THIS PROGRAM- YOU NEED TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THAT THE FARMERS DEMONSTRATE THE BAY- THEY ARE BELOW THE INCOME THRESHOLD WHICH IS 85% OF THE CITY STATE MEDIAN INCOME. WHICH COMES OUT TO SEVENTY EIGHT THOUSAND FOR A FAMILY OF THREE- AND THEN THAT THERE IS A NEED FOR CARE WHILE THE PARENTS ARE WORKING OR IN SCHOOL OR LOOKING FOR JOBS- SO THE PROVIDERS HOURS CAN VERY- THEIR AVAILABILITY BUT THE GOAL IS JUST TO SPECIFICALLY PROVIDE THE AMOUNT OF CARE NECESSARY PERFECT FOR FAMILIES TO WORK TO GO TO SCHOOL TO LOOK FOR WORK- AND THEN EVERYTHING THAT'S THAT'S ONE OF THE KEY DIFFERENCES FROM THIS PROGRAM FROM FROM FROM THE SCHOOL BASED PROGRAMS. THE OTHER KEY IS THAT- NO ALTHOUGH SOME SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS MAY BE ON SCHOOL CAMPUSES IT'S NOT TYPICAL THESE ARE TYPICALLY RUN BY PRIVATE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS- THE AREA THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY YOU KNOW- YOU KNOW ON A SCHOOL CAMPUS ARE NOT DESIGNED. SPECIFICALLY AROUND SCHOOL- SO I'M NOMINAL WATER ON THE ON THE NEXT WE OUR A CHART THAT WALK THROUGH THE MAIN LONG EXPAND LEARNING FOR THAT WORK BETTER SCHOOL BASED- AND THE TWO PROGRAMS ARE ONE OF THE ASUS PROGRAM AFTER SCHOOL EDUCATION FIFTY PROGRAM WHICH IS THE STATE FUNDED PROGRAM AND THEN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY- COMMUNITY LEARNING CENTERS WHICH IS THE FEDERAL FUNDED PROGRAM- THERE ARE A LOT OF SMALL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE PROGRAMS BUT I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE KEY THINGS THAT AGAIN WE DISTINGUISH THEM FROM THE OTHER PROGRAMS. FIRST- THE IS SOME SIMILAR. WITH THE DIRECT. OF EMPLOYMENT THERE. GRANTS AWARDED SPECIFIC SCHOOL SITES- SO THERE IS A AN APPLICATION PROCESS THAT YOU NEED TO APPLY FOR JOBS TO BE ABLE TO RECEIVE THE GRANT FUNDING- AND THEN THE PRIORITY IS PROVIDED TO THOSE SCHOOLS THAT ARE SERVING HIGHER PROPORTIONS OF LOW INCOME STUDENTS. I'M THE ONE KEY DIFFERENCE THOUGH THE PROGRAM ELIGIBILITY IS NOT LIMITED TO LOW INCOME. SO IF THEY THE SCHOOL SITE KEVIN THIS IS CRAP. THEY DON'T HAVE THE ONLY SERVE KIDS WHO WILL MEET IN COMPRESSION BUT- AND THERE THERE IS NO SORT OF INCOME ELIGIBILITY TO BE ABLE TO ENROLL- SCHOOLS MAY USE- INCOME. THE FAMILY'S INCOME TO SAY PRIORITIZE THAT THERE'S NOT ENOUGH SPACE FOR EVERYBODY. OR THEY MIGHT- THEY MIGHT DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT THEY DON'T. THEY ARE NOT PROHIBITED FROM CERTAIN QUESTIONS- SIMILARLY THEY THEY CAN CHOOSE TO- CHARGE FAMILY FEES ARE FOR THOSE FAMILIES WERE NOT LOW INCOME SO UNDER THE ASUS PROGRAM IN THE 20% TO PROGRAM- AT. PROGRAMS CANNOT CHARGE FEES FOR OUR FAMILIES TO QUALIFY FOR FREE AND REDUCED PRICE MEALS. FOR HOMELESS YOUTH OF. FOR OTHER FAMILIES IT IS OPTIONAL AND SO IN SOME CASES THERE MAY BE SOME. FAMILIES ARE PAYING. I'M THIS PROGRAM ARE BUILT PRIMARY AROUND THE SCHOOL DAY AND THIS YEAR- ON A SCHOOL SO IF THIS- TYPICALLY WILL. FROM WHEN SCHOOL ENDS THREE SELECT PM SIX PM AT LEAST SCHOOL COMPONENT OR SOME KIND OF SUMMER COMPONENT BUT THAT'S NOT COMMON. ON THESE ARE TYPICALLY- HELPING TO SORT OF BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN THE SCHOOL AND THE SCHOOL DAY ENDS. AND RAN- PARENTS ARE ARE OUT OF WORK- BUT THERE IS NOT A SPECIFIC- SERVICE THE REPORT THAT THAT THAT THIS PROGRAM. IS IT ADAPTING ON THE NEEDS OF THE WORK MEET THE PARENTS- AND ALTHOUGH THIS FUNDING GO. IT GOES TO SCHOOLS AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND CHARTER SCHOOLS. BY- WE DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC DATE ON THIS BUT IN MY HEART WE TALKED TO- SCHOOL DISTRICTS OPERATE THESE PROGRAMS. BY AND LARGE THESE PROGRAMS- OUR STAFF THROUGH PARTNERSHIPS WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THEMSELVES- ALTHOUGH THE FUNDING GOES DIRECTLY TO SCHOOLS MAYBE SORT OF VISION PLAN IMPORTANT ROLE IN BOTH. THE THE START TALKING PROGRAM THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER AND SCHOOL BASED PROGRAMS. GOOD NOW- MILLER. TURTLE PAGE OF OUR CHART TO TALK ABOUT THE EXPANDED LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES PROGRAM SO THIS IS A NEW PROGRAM THAT WAS CREATED. LAST YEAR IN THE BUDGET- A SCHOOL BASED- PROGRAM OF THE STATE PROVIDED ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS IN PROVENTIA FUNDING IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO TO ESTABLISH THE PROGRAM. AND THERE IS- THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE HAD INTENT THAT. IT THE PROGRAM WILL REACH FIVE BILLION DOLLARS BY TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX- AND THE GOVERNORS BUT THIS YEAR INCLUDES FUNDING TO GET THE PROGRAM UP TO FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS ALMOST ALL THE WAY THROUGH. I BELIEVE. I AM. BUT WE WOULD KNOW IF THERE. IF THIS PROGRAM WERE TO EXPAND AT THE AS INTENDED TO GET UP TO FIVE BILLION DOLLARS THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING IN THIS PROGRAM- WHAT'S GOING BUT HE'LL BE PROGRAMS. WOULD IT WOULD EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT WE PROVIDE FOR ALL THE OTHER PROGRAMS THAT I'VE ALREADY MENTIONED SO IT'S A VERY SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN FUNDING- AND HAS THE POTENTIAL TO SERVE A LOT MORE CHILDREN THAN WE CURRENTLY DO- UNDER OUR CURRENT PROGRAMS- THERE. THERE'S SOME. SIMILAR OF A LOT OF THE ELEMENTS OF BETA PROGRAM ARE SIMILAR TO THE STATE AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM READY- THE STAFFING RATIOS ARE THE SAME NUMBER. TWENTY CHILDREN FOR ONE ADULT- THAT MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS FOR STAFFING IS ALSO THE FAME. AND THE SAME ISSUE OF CHARGING FEES WHETHER THAT IT'S OPTIONAL BUT YOU CANNOT CHARGE FEES TO LOW INCOME FAMILIES ALMOST BEFORE YOU POST. THOSE COMPONENTS ARE STILL THERE- THERE ARE SOME KEY. THAT ARE THAT I WOULD TO HIGHLIGHT- THE BIGGEST THING IS THAT THIS IS NOT A COMPETITIVE GRANT PROGRAMS FUNDING TO PROVIDED TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND CHARTER SCHOOLS. THE FARM THE BETTER- A PERCENTAGE OF THEIR STUDENTS THAT ARE- INDICATOR SIX THAT ARE LOW INCOME OR ENGLISH LEARNERS. HAPPENING IS PROVIDED FOR THEM- IT'S NOT BASED ON THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN THAT THEY'RE SERVING AS A STATE PHARMACY THIS OVERALL FORMULA. AND SO IT IT IS. A BIGGER PART OF FORMING THE BAND DISTRICTS TO CHOOSE HOW TO ALLOCATE WHAT THEYWANT TO FOCUS ON ONE PARTICULAR SCHOOL SPREAD OUT THROUGHOUT THE OLDER AREAS WHERE THERE IS FLEXIBILITY FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO DECIDE- IT- IT'S NOT BASED. THIS FINDING ABOUT IS NOT BE. ON PARTICIPATION. IT'S BASED ON- THE T. THIRTY. CHARACTERS THE COMMITMENT OF THE OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT- THE OTHER KEEPING THAT I WOULD HIGHLIGHT IS THE REQUIREMENT FOR SUMMER SO BUT IN TERMS OF THE SCHOOL DAY THEY'RE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT THERE WERE THIRTY DEFINITELY BUT BY AND LARGE. BUT DURING THE SCHOOL YEAR REQUIREMENTS ARE VERY SIMILAR TO YOU SINCE- SO WE WOULD EXPECT THAT THERE WOULD BE- SIMILAR LEVELS OF COVERAGE DURING THAT AT THREE BUT- THE BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT YOU KNOW PM ASUS IS THAT IT DOES HAVE A SPECIFIC REQUIREMENT. THAT THE PROGRAM BE OPEN. FOR THIRTY DAYS DURING. DURING OUR OR OUT OF SCHOOL WITH LIKELY MISS SUMMER BUT ALSO COULD BE DURING INTERSESSION. BREAK OUT AND THAT THREE DURING THOSE THREE DAYS TO BE MAYBE A BRAND NEW NINE HOURS A DAY ABOUT SOMETHING THAT AN IMPORTANT. REQUIREMENT THAT DOESN'T EXIST RIGHT NOW UNDER THE EXISTING EXPANDED LEARNING PROGRAMS. MMHM SO I THINK THAT'S THAT'S ONE OF THE MAJOR DIFFERENCES HERE- I THINK BOTH OF BRISTOL STOP HERE IN TERMS OF THE SUMMARY TRYING TO WALK THROUGH THE THREE DIFFERENT PIECES I WOULD JUST WHEN I GET A BIG PICTURE YOU'LL YOU'LL HEAR MORE FROM THE SPECIFIC PROGRAM EXPERTS IN THE FIELD AFTER AFTER I FINISH TALKING BUT I THINK THIS SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN FUNDING CREATES OPPORTUNITY TO BETTER SERVE THE NEEDS OF OUR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES AND WE KNOW THAT THIS PART OF THE CONVERSATION TODAY WE HAVE HEARD SOME DISTRICTS CONCERNED ABOUT. DATA INCREASE IN AND BEAT UP THE PROGRAM AND ENSURING THAT THEY CAN- REFINED THE STAFFING TO PROGRAM I HAVE OVER THE COMING YEARS WE DO ALSO KNOW THAT THERE ARE NUMBER OF COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BEEN RUNNING SIMILAR PROGRAMS THAT ARE LOOKING FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO PARTNER WITH THEM SO- HOPEFULLY THE THOUGHT THIS OVER USE OVER JUST KIND OF GETTING ON A LABEL ON HOW THESE WORK ON SALISBURY I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS PEOPLE PROTECT. THANK YOU EDGAR YES THE OVER YOU VERY HELPFUL WE APPRECIATE THAT OUR NEXT WE'LL BE HEARING FROM THE SAMBAR DINO COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION THE YMCA OF SAN DIEGO AND BOTTLES NINOS WELCOME EVERYONE THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE WE'LL GET BEGIN WITH MR DURAN AND PROCEED IN ORDER OF THE WITNESSES LISTED ON THE AGENDA MR MURTADA RAM. PLEASE PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU MADAM. INTAKE FOR ALLOWING TO HAVE THIS PLAQUE. THANK YOU AND YOUR- THAT ROLE OF BREAK OF DIFFERENT PROGRAMS SO MY- IS EXPANDED LEARNING AND I KNOW THAT SENATOR LABOR'S BEEN A CHAMPION FOR US WITH THIS PROGRAM- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT. THIS NEW FUNDING WITH YELLOW HAS ALLOWED IS REALLY TOO. IT'S GIVEN US AN OPPORTUNITY TO INNOVATE WITH ALL STUDENTS WHO HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO PARTICIPATE AS YOU MENTIONED. THAT THAT THE ASUS TWENTY FIRST WAS LIMITED ON THE FUNDING RIGHT FOR STUDENT PER DAY- AND SAW THAT WE HAD A CERTAIN CAPITAL- WE COULD SERVE. THIS NEW FINDING WITH YELLOW PEAS ALLOWING US TO REALLY EXPAND THE SERVICES TO THOSE FOR INSTANCE IN OUR COUNTY. I HAVE TWENTY DISTRICTS THAT HAVE FUNDING TO ASUS TWENTY FIRST THERE'S THIRTY TWO JUST SIX IN OUR COUNTY SO NOW I HAVE AN ADDITIONAL THIRTEEN DISTRICTS THAT HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE SOMETHING INNOVATIVE FOR THE PANDEMIC. KIND OF PUT US IN A TAILSPIN. BUT IT ALSO BROUGHT EXPANDED LEARNING. TO THE FOREFRONT INSTEAD OF BEING AN AFTERTHOUGHT AFTER SCHOOL BECAME- WE HAD AS- A CHOICE CHAIR IN THE ROOM. IT MAY HAVE BEEN A FOLDING CHAIR BUT NOW WITH YELLOW KEY BECAUSE OF ALL THE- IT OF ALL THE- OF WHAT THE CAN DO. A THE DAY WHETHER IT BE MORNING OR EVENING AND IN SUMMER NOW WE ACTUALLY HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE SO THANK YOU. FOR ALLOWING THAT TO HAPPEN AND FOR PROVIDING THOSE MUCH NEEDED RESOURCES TO US. YOU ALSO MENTION AFTER THAT AS FAR AS BREEDING THE TWO PROGRAMS WITH U. PGA ANY L. O. P. IT IS A CHALLENGE INITIALLY BECAUSE IN REALITY WHEN. WE'RE USED TO WITH WORKING WITH ACES IN TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. THE C. K. IT WASN'T IN THE PICTURE SO T. K. IS VERY ADM TO AFTER SCHOOL AS WE KNOW IT- AND EVEN GENDER DOLE WAS PART OF IT. WASN'T A BIG FACTOR DIDN'T PLAY A BIG ROLE IN A LOT OF OUR CURRENT PROGRAMS SO NOW THE T. CASE COMING ON BOARD. IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO- AND YOU'LL HEAR FROM DOCTOR SHONDA BIT. ABOUT HOW WE CAN REALLY BREAK THOSE TWO PROGRAMS TOGETHER SO IT'S GONNA TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF TIME. TO REALLY FIGURE OUT. KIND OF WHAT. IS NEEDED NOT JUST AT THE SCHOOL SITES BUT HOW WE CAN USE THE COMMUNITY TO. MAKE THAT HAPPEN. SO YOU MONEY'S NEW QUESTION RIGHT THE WHOLE THING. BEING IN THIS GAME FOR A BIT WE ALWAYS HEARD WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO. PROVIDE ENOUGH MORE SERVICES AND YOU I'M SURE CENTER LABOR IN MANY ON EDUCATION COMMITTEE HEARD IT. THAT THERE WAS A WAITING LIST OVER AND OVER WE COULDN'T WE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH DOLLARS TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO THOSE STUDENTS AGAIN. THANKS TO THE C. L. O. P. FINDING U. K. THAT WE HOPE TO RAISE IN THE NEAR FUTURE. I'M AN INVITE- DR SMITH WAS SHOT TO COME IN AND SPEAK MORE TO. THE BRADY. WITH U. PGA AND THEN I'LL COME BACK ON. VERY GOOD THANK YOU WELCOME DOCTOR SMITH ROUSSIN PLEASE RECEIPT WHEN YOU'RE READY. THE MORNING ON EVERYONE THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY IS FOR YOU MY NAME IS DOCTOR KRISTIN THIS MY FIRST JOHN AND I AM- HAPPY TO REPRESENT SEVENTY NORTH TOWN. I WOULD HAVE TO COME AND TALK ABOUT UNIVERSAL PRE K. AND SO WHILE WE ARE VERY EXCITED ABOUT- HI NO THAT'S MY- EARLY CHILDHOOD DISTRICTS HAVE LOTS OF QUESTIONS- AND WE'RE SAYING THAT WE ARE IN THE PLAN TO MAKE THEIR- WHERE THEY'RE BEING ASKED TO TAKE. THE PLANT ALONG WITH YELLOW FRANCE AND WHAT WE ARE REALLY ENCOURAGING THEM TO DO IT TO THINK OF THIS AS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR SYSTEMS INTEGRATION- THINK OF THIS AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY START. OUR WHOLE FAMILY WILL NOT CHILD COMES THERE YOU'RE NOT JUST THERE FOR THAT CHILD AS A WHOLE FAMILY THAT CONNECTED TO IT AND WE BELIEVE THAT BY REALLY INTEGRATING NEW SYSTEMS THAT WILL BETTER ALLOW DISTRICTS ARE YOU DO THAT. IN A SCENE WITH EFFORT BUT IT WILL TAKE SOME YOU KNOW WORKING OUTSIDE THE BOXES AND BREAKING SILOS WHICH- EDUCATION HAS BEEN UNKNOWN TO DO IN THE PAST SO WE'RE REALLY ARE ALSO BEING DOING THAT AS YOU SEE HERE TODAY- MY COLLEAGUE JOHN AND I KNOW. I LEARNED HE'S EXPANDED ONE WE HAVE BEEN- BROUGHT TOGETHER UNDER A NEW DIVISION HERE AT A SEMINAR COMES IN THE SCHOOLS TO START REALLY MODELING THAT WORK OUT HOW WE CAN- REALLY- ONLINE SERVICES AND REALLY BRING. US SYSTEMS TOGETHER TO BETTER SERVE CHILDREN AND FAMILIES- THERE'S DEFINITELY FROM THE DISTRICT- CONCERN ABOUT- THE HEIGHTENED ATTENTION ON FOUR YEAR OLD AND REALLY WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN FOR OUR PEOPLE THAT BRING- IT IS A SYSTEM WHICH ARE THE ONES. ARE WE ARE THINKING ABOUT YOU KNOW IT'S NOT HARD TO SELL I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO THINK ABOUT THAT AND ALSO THE WORKFORCE CHALLENGES. THEIR FOURTH. IRAQ WE COMMITTING SUMMER YOU KNOW PARENTS WORKING TOGETHER TO STRATEGIZE INCLUDE USE A- COLLECTIVE IMPACT APPROACH TO SOLVING COMPLEX ISSUES- ANOTHER THING- I SUPPORT THAT WE'RE OFFERING TO OUR DISTRICTS AND WE'RE CREATING R. I. C. K. NETWORK SO THAT WE CAN COME FROM BRAINSTORM TOGETHER AROUND STRATEGIES FOR IMPLEMENTATION- HAVE A LOCAL PLANNING COUNCIL THAT IS. REALLY A COUNTY WIDE STAKEHOLDER OPPORTUNITY FOR EVERYONE IN THE COUNTY TO COME TOGETHER AND LEARN AND SUPPORT EACH OTHER AROUND EARLY LEARNING ISSUES- AND THEN ACTING UNDER UNDER MY EYES DEPARTMENT YOU WILL- DO OFFICE HOURS SO THAT WE CAN REALLY GET MY TEETH CLEANED. OUT FOR THOSE DISTRICTS THAT. ARE HAVING DIFFICULTY- AS JOHN'S THEY DIDN'T HAPPEN THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT ARE FOUND WHICH MEANS THAT THIRTY THREE PLANTS FOUR OAKLAND I NEED TO BE CREATED- OUR GOAL IS TO REALLY HELP AND SUPPORT THEM DISTRICTS IN A WAY WHERE THE PLANS THAT THEY SUBMIT WILL BE COMPREHENSIVE- AND THAT THEY WILL REALLY APPEAL NEEDS AND OF STUDENTS AND FAMILIES- I AM EXCITED- ABOUT. THE CHANGES ALTHOUGH THEY MAY CREATE CHALLENGES IT'S A VERY EXCITING TIME FOR EARLY LEARNED WE LEARNED DURING THE PANDEMIC- I'M BIASED I ALWAYS KNEW THAT THIS WAS VERY IMPORTANT- THOSE EARLY YEARS BUT WE REALLY LEARN HOW THE SYSTEM- SUPPORT THAT KIND OF THING- AND REALLY IT'S REALLY THE HEART. OF WHAT HE SAYS MOVING SOUTH I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT INVESTMENT I WANT TO THANK SENATOR RAY BEFORE CONTINUING YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SUMMER NOT FOUND. AND FOR- JUST REALLY CONTINUE TO SUPPORT IS VERY IMPORTANT OUR TIME AND CHILD IN THE FAMILY LIFE. THANK YOU YOU'RE MOST WELCOME AND THANK YOU FOR JOINING US TODAY MR GRAHAM DID YOU SAY YOU WERE GOING TO PICK UP AGAIN ARE WE GOING TO GO YES OKAY. THANK YOU SENATOR. SO THANK YOU. FOR SHARING THAT- SHE IS. REALLY THE- IN THE EARLY LEARNING- SO COMBINE ISSUE SO. THANKS TO OUR VERY. OF PUTTING THIS NEW DEPARTMENT TOGETHER. WE'RE NOW. TO ON WHAT IS AN STAKE IN WHAT WE'RE- ON CALL. IN ONE OF THE THINGS SHE MAY. WE ARE ASKED HOW DO YOU IS IT EASY TO BREAK THESE TWO PROGRAMS. IT ISN'T IN THE BEGINNING BECAUSE WE'RE COMING FROM TWO DIFFERENT. SETS OF TREES- AND UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC AND I LOVE THAT. CHRISTINA SAID PLAN TO MAKE. BECAUSE OF THAT PEOPLE ARE HARD TO FIND OUT TO STAFF ANDI WILL WE SPEAK TO DISTRICTS AND WE'VE BEEN DOING. A WORKSHOP FOR OUR LARGE DISTRICTS ARE RURAL DISTRICTS OR CHARTER SCHOOLS- AND INDIVIDUALLY MEETING WITH THEM TO SEE AND HEAR THEIR CONCERNS. ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES JOHN. WE DON'T EVEN HAVE TIME TO REALLY PLANNED FOR THIS BECAUSE WE'RE WE'RE PRETTY MUCH IN A SURVIVAL MODE OF HAVING THE PEOPLE THAT COULD WORK WITH THAT- HE'S LEARNING. OR WORKING AFTER SCHOOL THERE SOBBING THEY'RE HAVING TO FILL IN AT CENTRE AND I'M THIS IS ACROSS THE STATE I'M SURE. SO ONE THAT'S BEEN ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES FOR THEM. THE BLAST SCENE IS I TELL THEM IS THAT YOU'VE GIVEN US THE FLEXIBILITY. TO REALLY PLAN AND HAVE TIME TO PLAN SO IT WASN'T JUST SOMETHING THAT. YOU SENT TO US AND SAID OKAY WE NEED A BY SUCH AND SUCH DATE. AND THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF WHAT THIS THIS FUNDING IS ALLOWING US TO DO IS REALLY. PLAN FOR THE FUTURE AND AS YOU SAID TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY AND I KEEP REMINDING. OUR DISTRICTS AS THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO REALLY DO IS MEET WITH OUR PARENTS AND SEE WHAT. WHAT OTHER CONFUSION MAYBE BECAUSE THERE WAS CONFUSION WITH YELLOW G. TWO YELLOW PEAS AND SOME PEOPLE BLENDED THOSE TWO GUYS WAIT A MINUTE THAT'S- IT'S KIND OF SIMILAR BUT IT REALLY IS AS- IN THEN NOW WE HAVE U. P. SO. IT'S REALLY GETTING THE MESSAGE OUT ABOUT. LET YOU BREAK IT DOWN WHAT'S WHY AND WHO WERE SERVING. IN HIS BUT LIKE CHRISTINA SAID. THE SERVING FOUR YEAR OLD IS A CHALLENGE BUT I'LL LEAVE THAT TO HER HER- ARMANEN HEARD KNOWLEDGE TO BE ABLE TO REALLY WORK WITH ME. AND HOW WE LOOK FORWARD TO MOVE FORWARD WITH EXPANDED LEARNING. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DO IS WE DON'T JUST PREACH AND NOT PRACTICE WHAT WE PREACH WE'VE BEEN MODELING CAPS OF NINE HOURS TOO SO DISTRICTS CAN SEE HOW THE DAY LOOKS ESPECIALLY IN THOSE INTERCESSION SUMMER PROGRAMS. IS IT BECAUSE THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN A CONCERN ARE YOU SURE WE HAVE TO RUN A NINE HOUR PROGRAM. SO WE CAN BREAK IT DOWN AND HOLDING CAMPS WITH STUDENTS SO THEY COULD SEE HOW THAT MAY LOOK IN DURING SUMMER SESSION. GOOD IT'S ALWAYS BEEN AS I MENTIONED EARLIER. WHERE PEOPLE SAY WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO DO THE THINGS THAT WE WANTED TO DO. AND YOU KNOW THERE'S THAT OLD SAYING NO MONEY NO MISSION BUT THEY FORGET THE SECOND PART OF THAT SCENE WHICH- THERE'S NO MISSION. NO NEED FOR MONEY SO I REMINDED DISTRICTS IS. THAT REALLY LET'S HAVE A MISSION HAVE YOUR MISSION AND YOUR GOAL OF WHAT YOU PLAN TO DO. BEFORE NOW YOU HAVE THE MONEY SO WE CAN REALLY SERVE THE NEEDS OF OUR COMMUNITY. I LIKE TO CALL IT IT'S TEA TIME. IN TV BECAUSE- IT'S GOING TO TAKE TO NASA. AND WE WILL HAVE TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS DURING THIS TIME. AND OF COURSE YES IT'S GOING TO TAKE TIME TO GET THIS TO GET THIS OFF THE GROUND AND REALLY ENOUGH TO DESERVE TO DESIGN PROGRAMS. THAT WE CAN SERVE THE NEEDS OF OUR STUDENTS AND TO ALSO. SHAKE THE BUSHES TO SEE WHO ELSE WE CAN BRING ON BOARD THAT HAVE BEEN AND MISSING DURING THIS PANDEMIC HERE. I JUST WANT TO CLOSE WITH THIS IF I MAY TWO DAYS. THE READ ACROSS AMERICA AND BLUE I KNOW DOCTOR RESIGNED AND I REDEEM TO SCHOOLS LATER NOW I'M GONNA READ THAT I'M READING TO THE STUDENTS A MAGIC IS IN YOU. BY COLIN HOSTING AND BROOKLYN TELL. THEN IT SIMPLY SAYS IT'S HARD TO LEAVE THE PAST BEHIND. JUST REMEMBER THE MAGIC IS IN YOU. TO CREATE A FUTURE OF BEAUTIFUL MEMORIES AND I THINK THAT FITS WITH THIS HEARING TODAY AND THAT WE NEED TO KIND OF FORGET WHAT WE LEARNED IN THE SENSE OF WHAT WE THOUGHT PROGRAMMING WAS BECAUSE LIKE I SAID AN AFTER SCHOOL TEACHER HE DIDN'T EXIST. SO OW WE REALLY NEED TO START BUILDING ON THE FUTURE IF WE REALLY WANT TO BUILD THIS PIPELINE FROM ZERO TO TWELVE IN ON AND BEYOND. IT WAS LASTING ALL LEAVE ALL UP I SAID THIS BEFORE BUT NOW I REALLY AM GOING TO ADVOCATE FOR THE FUNDING IS TEACHING A SIX SOMEHOW THAT WE CAN FIND FUNDING TO REALLY BUILD PROGRAMS. IN OUR MIDDLE HIGH SCHOOL WHERE IS MUCH NEEDED- AS YOU KNOW WE HAVE ASSETS AS FAR AS THE FUN OF FEDERAL DOLLARS THAT COME IN FROM THE STATE. BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH. B. ONE WORST WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO SAY WE'RE BUILDING THIS PIPELINE. I THINK WE NEED TO ALSO TRY AND INCLUDE THEM. AS FAR AS MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL. YOUR TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR DURAND'S NEXT WE'RE GOING TO GO TO COURTNEY BOTH SKI I AM SO SORRY PARDON I GET THAT RIGHT BUT YOU PLEASE CORRECT ME LOVE YOUR FLAG IN THE BACKGROUND AND PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MY NAME IS COURTNEY MULTI SKI- WITH THE YMCA OF SAN DIEGO COUNTY IT'S AN HONOR TO BE WITH YOU ALL TODAY. I COME HERE AS AN ADVOCATE FOR CHILDREN YOUTH AND THEIR FAMILIES. I CONTRIBUTE TO THIS WORK FOR OUR COLLECTIVE ORGANIZING EFFORTS WITH THE DIEGO. AND WITH THE WIRE AS A DIRECTOR OF ADVOCACY AND STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP. MY DRIVING MOTIVATION COMES FROM BEING A MOTHER OF A CURIOUS SEVEN YEAR OLD NAMED MAX AND A STRONG WILLED FOR YOUR OLD NAME NORA. BOTH OF MY CHILDREN WERE CARED FOR BY FAMILY CHILD CARE PROVIDERS. AS INFANTS AND TODDLERS THEN ATTENDED QUALITY FULL DAY YEAR ROUND PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD. MY PARTNER AND I COULD NOT HAVE CONTINUED WORKING WITHOUT THESE INCREDIBLE EARLY EDUCATORS IN OUR LIVES. THEY WILL FOREVER BE OUR EXTENDED FAMILY. AS A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION THE YMCA OF SAN DIEGO COUNTY IS COMMITTED TO WORKING ALONGSIDE OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS FOCUSED ON CREATING EQUITABLE SYSTEMS THROUGH AN APPROACH THAT EMBRACES THE WHOLE CHILD. WHOLE FAMILY AND WHOLE COMMUNITIES. AT THE HEART OF OUR WORK WE HOLD THESE NEEDS OF PARENTS CAREGIVERS AND CHILDREN IN FULL DAY FULL YEAR LEARNING CARE SO THAT ALL MAY REACH. THEIR FULLEST POTENTIAL WE DO A LOT TO HELP OUR COMMUNITIES CHILDCARE AND EXPANDED LEARNING NEEDS THROUGH A VARIETY OF PROGRAMS. THAT THE ELLIE- OFFICE MENTIONS WAITING LISTS YOU'RE READY GET SET THESE PROGRAMS INCLUDE EIGHTY FOUR EXPANDED LEARNING PROGRAMS THE SCHOOL DISTRICT PARTNERS INCLUDING ASUS AND ASSETS CONTRACTS. WE ARE IN DISCUSSION WITH PARTNERS FOR ELL HE PROGRAMS THE RATES CONTINUE TO BE A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE. FIFTY FIVE LICENSED CHILDCARE CENTERS FOR AGES ZERO TO TWELVE ON SCHOOL CAMPUSES AND CHILD CARE CENTERS. TWENTY FIVE AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS FOCUSED ON CHILD WELLNESS DAY CAMPS FOR AS MANY AS NINE THOUSAND CHILDREN DAILY PRE PANDEMIC AND OVER A DOZEN LOCATIONS DURING SUMMER MONTHS. MULTIPLE PROGRAMS TO CONNECT CHILDREN YOUTH AND FAMILIES TO MENTAL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES. ADDITIONALLY WE ARE SEEING YOUR COUNTY'S RESOURCE AND REFERRAL AGENCY FOR CHILD CARE. AND CHILD CARE ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT PROVIDER THIS PUTS US IN DIRECT CONTACT WITH OVER FOUR THOUSAND CHILDCARE PROVIDERS. AND NEARLY FORTY THOUSAND FAMILIES LAST FISCAL YEAR. THIS COMBINED WORK HAS A TREMENDOUS IMPACT WITHIN A SIGNIFICANT ECOSYSTEM. IN THIS ECOSYSTEM THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF YMCA STAFF PARENTS CARE GIVERS EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION PROFESSIONALS AND SCHOOL DISTRICT PARTNERS. ALL ARE NECESSARY TO ENSURE THE YOUNGEST MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY. AGES ZERO TO TWELVE ARE SURROUNDED BY SETTINGS WHERE THEY CAN THRIVE AND BEGIN ON A PATH TOWARD PROSPERITY. WE WILL HEAR MANY THEMES TODAY ONE IMPORTANTLY IS HE COMPASSION AND DEDICATION OF OUR CHILD CARE AND EXPANDED LEARNING WORK FORCE. ANOTHER SADLY IS THE STATE'S HISTORIC UNDERFUNDING AND FRANKLY UNDERVALUING OF THIS WORK FORCE RIGHT R. A RECENT STUDY WITH THE CENTER OF THE STUDY OF CHILD CARE EMPLOYMENT DESCRIBES THESE EDUCATORS ASK FOR GOTTEN ONES. IN THIS REPORT A CALIFORNIA PROVIDER SHARED. WE'RE CERTAINLY FRONTLINE WORKERS WE ARE THE FORGOTTEN ONES. AS WE ENGAGE WITH YOUNG CHILDREN WE EXPOSE OURSELVES AND OTHERS AND TAKE HEALTH RISKS EVERY DAY WE DESERVE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND BETTER PAY AS AN INDUSTRY. IN SAN DIEGO SEVENTY NINE CHILDCARE CENTRES REMAIN CLOSED NEARLY 10% OF OUR PRE PANDEMIC SUPPLY. A HUNDRED AND FORTY EIGHT FAMILY CHILD CARE PROVIDERS REMAIN CLOSED NEARLY FIVE PERCENT. OF OUR PRE PANDEMIC SUPPLY. AN ADDITIONAL ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO CHILD CARE PROVIDERS REMAIN INACTIVE MEANING SAN DIEGO STANDS TO LOSE AN ADDITIONAL TWO THOUSAND. TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX LICENSED CHILD CARE SLOTS. ALL THIS WHILE PREPENDED MAKE LICENSE LOTS IN SAN DIEGO WERE ONLY AVAILABLE THAN 8% FOR INFANT AND TODDLER SLOTS. THESE ARE SMALL BUSINESSES OWNED BY THE COMMUNITY FOR COMMUNITY MEMBERS WE ALL LOSE WE LOSE ENTREPRENEURS AND EDUCATORS WHO ARE LARGELY WOMEN OF COLOR WE LOSE SAFE PLACES FOR CHILDREN AND RESOURCE HUBS FOR FAMILIES. WE LOSE THE HOPE OF GREATER ECONOMIC PROSPERITY FOR OUR REGION. SIMILARLY OUR EXPANDED LEARNING TEAMS DID NOT SKIP A BEAT DURING THE PANDEMIC. BIDDING TO SUPPORT VIRTUALLY THAN IN PERSON PRIOR TO SCHOOLS BEING OPEN. WITH SUPPORT FROM OUR COUNTY AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS SUMMER PROGRAM SERVES STUDENTS IN PERSON IN TWENTY TWENTY. AND THIS AT A PACE FOR REOPENING PLANS THAT MUNICIPALITIES AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS ADOPTED IN LATER MONTHS. OUR TEAMS TO GREAT RISK FOR THEMSELVES AND FOR THEIR FAMILIES. WHY DID THEY DO IT. WHEN ASKED TO SITE SUPERVISOR SHARE WE KNEW OUR PRINCIPAL PARENTS AND OF COURSE KIDS NEEDED US. OUR STUDENTS WERE AT HOME SOME ON THEIR OWN. THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS WHO DIED OF COVE IT AND WE SAW THE LIGHT LEAVING THEIR EYES. WE'RE CONTINUALLY GRATEFUL FOR THE IMPORTANT WORK HAPPENING WITH PARTNERS AT CVG AND DSS. ADMINISTERING THESE RESOURCES TO THE COMMUNITY IS NO EASY TASK AND COLLABORATION HAS BEEN KEY TO ENSURE. THOSE WITH THE GREATEST NEEDS ARE EFFICIENTLY RECEIVING RESOURCES WITH THIS SOME OF WHAT WE'VE EXPERIENCED INCLUDES. DELAYED CONTRACTS THE WAY FUNDING UNREALISTIC TIMELINES. AND UNCOMPENSATED EXPECTATIONS. USER ADDED BURDENS ON OUR ADMINISTRATIVE EFFORTS WHICH ARE ALREADY INCREDIBLY FATIGUED BY THE DAY TO DAY OPERATIONS OF THE IMPORTANT WORK HAPPENING INCLUDING THE CONTINUED CHALLENGE. OF HIRING. OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS ALSO EXPERIENCE LIMITED RESOURCES DUE TO HISTORIC UNDERFUNDING UNJUST ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS. AND CUMBERSOME SYSTEMS THEY MUST NAVIGATE ALL OF PARENTING AND OFTEN WORKING FULL TIME. AS CALIFORNIA MOVES TO IMPLEMENT TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN ACROSS THE STATE IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT POLICY MAKERS AND OUR DISTRICTS DESIGNED TO KEEP PROGRAMS THEY CONSIDER REFLECT THE DIVERSE NEEDS AND PERSPECTIVES MANY STAKEHOLDERS WHICH MAKE UP THE LARGER ECOSYSTEM OF THE UNIVERSAL PRE KINDERGARTEN SYSTEM WE SEE THE SCOPE OF WORK AS A PROGRAM ADMINISTRATOR. THERE ARE MANY COMPLEXITIES AND IMPLICATIONS TO CONSIDER. IT IS OKAY TO SLOW THIS DOWN AND YOUR CHILDREN FAMILIES AND ALL EDUCATORS JUSTICE IN CALIFORNIA TOGETHER TO CREATE AN IMPORTANT RESOURCE FOR STATE INCLUSIVE FRAMEWORK FOR DESIGNING AND IMPLEMENTING PRE KINDERGARTEN IN CALIFORNIA IS A DECISION MAKING MODEL FOR SCHOOL DISTRICT'S POLICY MAKERS AND COMMUNITY LEADERS TO LOOK TOO AS THEY CREATE SHE K PROGRAMS THAT BENEFIT AND UPLIFT THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY. THROUGH A WHOLE CHILD WHOLE FMILY WILL COMMUNITY APPROACH THIS FRAMEWORK EXPLORES THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF STUDENTS AND FAMILIES EXPANDED LEARNING PROVIDERS CHILDCARE PROVIDERS SCHOOLS AND EDUCATORS AND OFFERS A SET OF RECOMMENDATIONS DESIGNED TO MEET. EACH MEETING. THIS FRAMEWORK IS INCLUDED IN YOUR PACKAGE TODAY. THEMES OF THIS FRAMEWORK INCLUDE CONTINUED AWARENESS RAISING ACROSS OUR SECTORS SHARED DECISION MAKING AUTHENTIC ENGAGEMENT AND PARTNERSHIPS FOR HOLISTIC SUPPORT AND FULL DAY PROGRAMMING. AND IMPORTANTLY A PARENT'S ABILITY TO CHOOSE WHAT IS BEST FOR THEIR FAMILY. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TODAY AND FOR SHARING THE BELIEF THAT WHEN WE CHOOSE TO PURSUE A BETTER TOMORROW TOGETHER. WE CAN CREATE A CALIFORNIA WHERE YOUNGEST LEARNERS AND THEIR FAMILIES REACH RESILIENCE. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISS POLSKI YOUR COMMENTS WERE ABSOLUTELY SPOT ON AND WE APPRECIATE EVERYTHING THAT YOU WERE DOING THANK YOU. NEXT WE'RE GOING TO MOVE MOVE TO MISS ANGELA CAPONE WHEN YOU'RE READY MISS COMPOUND PLEASE PROCEED. I THINK YOU'RE ON MUTE. OKAY STILL HARASSED ALL OF US WELCOME HI IT'S NOT. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIRMAN- AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT CARLOS NINO'S WHOSE EARLY CHILDHOOD PROGRAM- BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY TO SHARE SOME OF THE STRUGGLES ON WE APPRECIATE THE DIRECTION THAT THE STATE IS MOVING AND REALLY SHINING THE LIGHT ON THE IMPORTANCE OF THE EARLY YEARS. CURRENTLY CARLOS NINOS OPERATES SEVEN EARLY CHILDHOOD PROGRAMS IN THE GREATER LOS ANGELES AREA- AND THERE'S SOMETHING THAT'S DECEPTIVE ABOUT SAYING SEVEN. ON IT SOUNDS EASY WE HAVE PROGRAMS THAT SERVE CHILDREN TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY DAYS A YEAR. AND WE SERVE THEM TEN AND A HALF HOURS A DAY WE ARE PROGRAMMED SETS ARE OPEN TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY DAYS TWO YEARS SERVING CHILDREN SEVEN. OR EIGHT OR NINE HOURS A DAY WE HAVE PROGRAMS THAT ARE OFTEN OPEN A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE DAYS A YEAR. ON SERVING CHILDREN SIX HOURS A DAY SO WHAT I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT THE TASK AT HAND IS JUST AS YOU SAID AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS MEETING. TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT FAMILY NEEDS ARE DIFFERENT AND DIVERSE AND IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY WE BELIEVE OF PROGRAMS TO MEET THOSE NEEDS AND MEET THOSE CHILDREN AND FAMILIES WHERE THEY ARE IN THE MOST RESPONSIVE WAY. THAT DOES NOT COME WITHOUT THE CHALLENGE. ON WE OPERATE OUR PROGRAMS BY BLENDING FUNDING WE PROVIDE WE USE HEAD START DOLLARS. PLUS C. S. P. P. DOLLARS TO SERVE OUR PRESCHOOLERS THREE TO FIVE AND WE USE EARLY HEAD START DOLLARS PLUS THE CTR DOLLARS TO SERVE OUR INFANTS AND TODDLERS. ON I WANT TO BE REALLY CLEAR THAT WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BRAID FUNDING. BUT IT DOES NOT COME WITHOUT ITS CHALLENGES OUR FAMILIES AND OUR PROVIDER MUST ENSURE THAT FAMILIES MEET THE CRITERIA OF BOTH FUNDING SOURCES. AND THOSE FUNDING SOURCES ARE NOT ALWAYS CONSISTENT SO WHILE A CHILD FAMILY MAY QUALIFY FOR C. S. P. P. SERVICES THEY DO NOT QUALIFY FOR HEAD START SERVICES POTENTIALLY. AND THAT MEANS THAT IF WE'VE GRADED FUNDING IN A CLASSROOM THAT FAMILY CANNOT PARTICIPATE IN THAT CLASSROOM. SO WE TURN OURSELVES INTO PRETZELS TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE CLASSROOMS THAT HAVE SINGULAR FUNDING SO THAT WE CAN SERVE AS MANY FAMILIES AS POSSIBLE. BASED ON THEIR NEEDS- ALSO JUST TO BE CLEAR ON THE FUNDING WE HAVE RECEIVED INCREASES WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR THE INCREASES IN THOSE FUNDING BUT NEITHER HEAD START FUNDING NOR. C. S. P. P. OR C. C. T. R. FUNDING PROVIDED ALL THE FUNDS THAT WE NEED TO- TO RUN A PROGRAM WE RUN AT A DEFICIT AND WE ARE GRATEFUL TO OUR LISTENING AS HIS DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT. ON AND PHILANTHROPISTS WHO ARE THERE TO SUPPORT US IN THE IMPORTANCE OF WORK THAT WE DO- I WANT TO REALLY- HEARKEN BACK TO. COURTNEY'S WORDS WHERE SHE ACKNOWLEDGE THE ROLE OF EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATORS IN THE LIVES OF FAMILIES I. SHEIK HEARING THOSE WORDS AND I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT IT IS ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS TO HAVE KNOWLEDGE THAT WE JOINED THE FAMILY. IN HELPING PARENTS TO ENSURE THAT THEIR CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES THRIVE IN AN ENVIRONMENT THAT IS DIFFICULT FOR THEM AND THAT IS OUR GOAL. JUST SO THAT YOU REALIZE 49% OF OUR FAMILIES ARE AT THE POVERTY LEVEL OR BELOW. IDENTIFY AS HOMELESS. 57% OF OUR FAMILIES ARE SPANISH SPEAKERS. ON RIGHT NOW EARLY ADD FACES A MAJOR CRISIS AND THAT IS A CRISIS OF TEACHERS QUALIFIED TEACHERS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN PL AND VERY LONG HISTORY. WE HAVE CHILDREN ON THE WAITING LIST NOT BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE OPENINGS FOR CHILDREN BUT BECAUSE WE DO NOT HAVE TEACHERS TO PUT IN CLASSROOMS THIS HAS BECOME A CRISIS EARLY EDUCATION THAT PREPARES PEOPLE TO JOIN A PROFESSION THAT IS THE CENTRAL IMPORTANCE IN NOT ONLY THE LIVES OF CHILDREN AND FAMILIES BUT IN PREPARING CHILDREN FOR LIFE AND FOR EACH SUCCESSIVE EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY- IN TERMS OF THE CHANGING COMPLEXION OF LOS ANGELES MORE AND MORE OF OUR FAMILIES ARE WORKING. SO WE HAVE TURNED ONE OR MORE OF OUR CLASSROOMS INTO FULL DAY CLASSROOMS TO MEET FAMILY NEEDS. BUT THAT MEANS IN A ROOM THAT I COULD HAVE SERVED FIFTEEN CHILDREN IN THE MORNING AND FIFTEEN CHILDREN IN THE AFTERNOON THAT'S SERVING THIRTY FAMILIES I CAN NOW ONLY SERVE FIFTEEN FAMILIES. AND QUITE HONESTLY- IN EARLY AND WE HAVE A SAYING IT'S CALLED THE DEARTH OF EARTH. IN LOS ANGELES THAT IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND FACILITIES TO GROW OUR PROGRAMS TO MEET THE GROWING NEEDS OF FAMILIES- AND WHEN WE FIND FACILITIES THAT RENTS. WE HAVE A FACILITY WHERE THE RENT IS UPWARDS OF A MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR THIS FAR EXCEEDS THE FUNDING. FOR PRESCHOOL PROGRAM. I ELLEN IS APPS COMMITTED TO FINDING SOLUTIONS TO THE STRUGGLES THAT OUR FAMILIES AND OUR CHILDREN ENCOUNTER- AND WE ARE PROUD TO HAVE. AS MANY OPTIONS AS WE HAVE AND WE ARE PLEASED TO PARTNER WITH STATE PROGRAMS TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THOSE OPTIONS- WE JOIN YOU IN KEEPING AN EYE ON THE IMPORTANCE OF THE EARLY YEARS AND THIS WORK WITH CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS CAPONE WE ARE NOW GOING TO MOVE TO CECILIA HERNANDEZ CECILIA BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY NATIONAL THIS DIRECTOR OF EXTENDED LEARNING AND I'M HERE REPRESENTING VITAL SENONES ALSO MEANT TO START OFF WITH GIVING YOU A LITTLE BIT OVERVIEW. I DON'T KNOW YES BACKGROUND WE WERE FOUNDED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY AND PLN HAS BEEN SERVING THE COMMUNITY OF DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELESFOR ABOUT FORTY YEARS NOW. AND WE SERVE AND SUPPORT ABOUT TEN THOUSAND CHILDREN YOUTH AND FAMILIES A YEAR AND THAT IS THROUGH OUR DIFFERENT- PROGRAMS AND DEPARTMENTS THAT WE HAVE SUCH AS EARLY EDUCATION AND CHARTER SCHOOLS AFTER SCHOOL YOUTH WORKSOURCE. MENTAL HEALTH THE WRAPAROUND SERVICES IN AN APPARENT LEADERSHIP ENGAGEMENT SO TO GIVE YOU A QUICK OVERVIEW OF THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE FAMILIES WE SERVE. ABOUT 90% LATINO AND THEIR- YEARLY INCOME IS TECHNICALLY RIGHT AT ABOUT FIFTEEN THOUSAND A YEAR. BUT APPROXIMATELY MORE THAN 50% OF OUR STUDENTS HAVE OUR PARENTS SORRY DO NOT HAVE A COLLEGE DEGREE. SO TODAY YOU HEARD A LITTLE BIT ABOUT OUR EARLY EDUCATION PROGRAM AND NEXT I WILL BE SPEAKING ABOUT OUR AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU ALL- THREE HIGHLIGHTS THAT DIFFERENCE- FROM OTHER PROGRAMS WITHIN THE AFTER SCHOOL FIELD. AND OUR AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMMING OR THREE CHARTER SCHOOLS IS DESIGNED TO SERVE OUR STUDENTS WITH A VERY SAFE AND ENRICHING ENVIRONMENT CONSIDERING WE ARE IN THE SKID ROW AREA OF DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES. AND WE INTEGRATE VARIOUS COMPONENTS ON OUR DAILY- SCHEDULE SUCH AS ACADEMIC. ACTIVITIES IN THE AREAS OF STEM SOCIAL EMOTIONAL LEARNING ARTS AND WE HAVE VARIOUS COLLABORATIVE PARTNERSHIPS THAT WE WORK WITH SO IN ORDER TO MAKE ALL THIS POSSIBLE WE REALLY HAVE TO CONSIDER ALL OF THE FUNDING SOURCES THAT WE WORK WITH. SUCH AS THEIR. TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. R. A. AND R. C. C. T. WHICH IS A GREAT SURELY OUR EARLY AT TWO KEY UP. WHICH MEANS THAT. OUR TO OUR OUR REACH. ARE LIKE. AFTER SCHOOL. TO COMMUNITY CAROL. AND THROUGH THE USE OF DIFFERENT FUNDING SOURCES WERE ABLE TO PROVIDE- PROGRAMMING TO ALMOST OUR CHARTER SCHOOLS. I DON'T WANT TO MENTION A PARTICULAR HIGHLIGHT. IN OUR AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS IS THAT ALL OF OUR STAFF ARE EMPLOYED BY BUT IT WAS THE YOUNG SWITCH LEXUS OPERATE DIFFERENTLY AND NOT AS A CONTRACTOR. I'D REALLY SUPPORTS THE COOPERATION AND INTEGRATION WITH THE SCHOOL DAY SO WE'RE REALLY ABLE TO CONNECT AND HELP OUR CHILDREN. AND FAMILIES IN VARIOUS DIFFERENT LEVELS AS WE ARE ALL ONE AND WE PRIDE IN THE INTEGRATED SERVICES MODEL ALSO BECAUSE WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO LINK OUR FAMILIES TO OTHER SERVICES SUCH AS- YOU KNOW THE NEED OF MENTAL HEALTH OR WANTS HER. STUDENTS ARE A LITTLE BIT OLDER THEY JOINED THE YOUTH WORKS DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT- SO THAT REALLY BRINGS US INTO BEING ABLE TO SUPPORT THE WHOLE FAMILY. ONE OF OUR MAJOR HIGHLIGHTS I WOULD SAY WITHIN OUR DEPARTMENT OF AFTER SCHOOL IS THAT INTERCESSION FOR THE PROGRAMS. AND THAT IS OUR MAN R. SORRY OURS SUMMER. AND OUR SPRING AND FALL PROGRAMS THAT WE OFFER IT. THE GRAND IT'S REALLY GOING TO. US REALLY BECOME TO A DAY. AS I MENTIONED SCHOOLS ARE. YOU KNOW COMMUTER SCHOOLS AND IN THE DOWNTOWN AREA SO MANY OF OUR FAMILIES ACTUALLY FOR TWO OUT OF THREE. LIVE OUTSIDE OF THAT THE COMMUNITY SO THIS REALLY HELPS US AND MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE ABLE TO PROVIDE. MORE DAYS. OF PROGRAMMING FOR OUR STUDENTS. CURRENTLY DURING THE SUMMER AND THE SPRING BREAK. AND THE BALL PROGRAM WE OFFER A PRETTY EXTENSIVE DAY BUT WITH THE SUPPORT I WOULD DEFINITELY LET US INCREASE OUR NUMBERS AS WE STILL HAVE SOME WEIGHTLESS. I WAS SPECIAL HIGHLIGHT OF ALL THOSE PROGRAMS IS THAT WE REALLY FOCUS ON COMMUNITY EXPLORATION. DURING THE INTERSESSION PROGRAMS WHERE WE REALLY WANT TO TAKE THE KIDS OUTSIDE OF THE COMMUNITY HAVE THEM EXPLORE AND LEARN. NEW PLACES THAT HONESTLY IF IT WOULD HAVE BEEN FOR OUR PROGRAMS THEY WOULDN'T PROBABLY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY. TO ATTEND ALL THOSE PLACES. BUT ALONG WITH HIGHLIGHTS AND GOOD THINGS IN OUR PROGRAMS ALSO ROADBLOCKS. AND ONE OF THE BIG ONES IS WEIGHTLESS. YOU KNOW I DOLLARS ONLY SO GO STRAIGHT IN. YOU KNOW WAY SO WE STILL HAVE. QUITE A FEW NUMBER OF STUDENTS ON THE WAITLIST AS YOU KNOW THE GRASS ONLY ALLOW US TO SERVE X. AMOUNT OF STUDENTS. ANOTHER BIRD AND THAT HURTS OUR BUDGET IS THE COST OF FACILITIES AND MAINTENANCE OUR BUDGETS ARE ALREADY SO TIGHT BUT YOU KNOW THESE ARE EXPENSES THAT. YOU KNOW ARE NEEDED FRENCH STATE TODAY PROGRAMMING. AND AS OTHERS HAVE MENTIONED THE WORK FORCE ISSUES AND PAY IS CRITICAL- WE TEND TO BE VERY SHORT STAFFED AND THAT. THIS TIME- AND WE ALSO NEED TO STAY COMPETITIVE WITH SALARIES YOU KNOW S. RECRUITMENT HAS ALSO BEEN A HUGE PROBLEM ACROSS THE FIELD I SEE HERE IN EARLY AND IT IS THE SAME FOR. OUR AFTER SCHOOL PROVIDERS. SO THE OTHER CRUCIAL THING IS THAT ABILITY TO HAVE STAFF- COVERED DIFFERENT. MASSES OR PLACES. BECAUSE OF THE GRANT REQUIREMENTS LIKE I MENTIONED WE HAVE DIFFERENT GRANTS SO THEY HAVE DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS AND STAFFING- AND LASTLY. IN ORDER TO MAKE ALL THIS POSSIBLE WE DEPEND HIGHLY ON OUR EXTERNAL AFFAIRS TEAMS TO HAVE THE CAPACITY TO. FIND ADDITIONAL FUNDING SO THAT WE'RE ABLE TO. HAVE MORE STUDENTS IN OUR PROGRAMS OR DOES INTERCESSION SUMMER DAYS AND- LIKE I MENTIONED BEFORE. ANY OTHER EXTRA FUNDING WOULD DEFINITELY HELP WAS REALLY HAPPY MORE KIDS IN OUR PROGRAM AS IT IS. REALLY SAD AND DIFFICULT TO TURN AWAY STUDENTS BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH FUNDING TO PROVIDE THE PROGRAM FOR EVERYONE- FOR I AND I JUST WANNA SAY. THREE FUNDAMENTAL SUPPORT AND PARTNERSHIP SENATOR DOLE OUT SO THANK YOU FOR THE SUPPORT- THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR TIME. AND THIS IS A GOOD UP I LOVE YES AFTER PROGRAM THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MISS. WE'RE NOW GOING TO MOVE ON OUR FOR OUR NEXT PANEL BUT THANK YOU SO MUCH TO OUR FIRST PANELIST. AND IF I CAN ASK YOU TO STAY ON SO THAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO GO TO YOU FOR QUESTIONS AT THE END. OUR NEXT OUR PANEL INCLUDES CHILD ACTION AND A PARENT WE WELCOME BOTH OF YOU MR GARCIA WE WILL START WITH YOU PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR. AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK A LITTLE BIT FURTHER. ALREADY FROM THE PRESENTERS ABOUT SOME OF THE CHALLENGES WITH THE SYSTEMS OF CARE. THAT ARE AVAILABLE FOR OUR FAMILIES. I MYSELF WORK AT A RESOURCE AND REFERRAL. PROGRAM HERE. IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY AND ONE. FOR BRING DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES OF THE STRUGGLES AND CHALLENGES THEY FACE. AS THEY SEEK AFFORDABLE QUALITY CARE FOR THEMSELVES. AS A RESOURCE AND REFERRAL AGENCY WE ARE OFTEN THE FIRST POINT OF CONTACT FOR FAMILIES LOOKING FOR. THIS PARTICULAR CARE TO SERVE YOUR NEEDS. AS THEY STRUGGLE TO FIND THAT SHARE. WHEN THE FIRST COMPONENTS IS THE HOURS OF CARE THAT THEY NEED. IN THE DAYS OF CARE THAT THING. THIS OFTEN BECOMES A STRUGGLE WITH THE MATCHING THOSE HOURS AND DAYS. THAT A FAMILY MIGHT NEED CARE WITH THE HOURS AND DAYS YOUR ABILITY FOR CHILD CARE PROVIDERS. MORE RECENTLY OF COURSE THESE BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC. PROVIDERS HAVE STRUGGLED WITH THE HOURS OF OPERATION. SOME OF THEM HAVING TO CLOSE TEMPORARILY SOME CLOSING. DOWN LONGER TERM. WAS FAMILIES WORK THROUGH THAT AND FINDING THE RIGHT MATCH FOR THEMSELVES. THERE ARE. ALWAYS CHALLENGES WITH THE- TRANSPORTATION OR- SOME OF THE OTHER FAMILY NEEDS THAT COME UP BECAUSE OF LIMITED. ECONOMIC ACCESS. IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT A- AS A RESOURCE AND REFERRAL. MATERNITY PROGRAM HERE IN SACRAMENTO THAT DO HAVE RESOURCES WILL. RETURN APPEARED PROGRAMS. THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA IN EVERY COUNTY AND THOSE STORIES WITHIN THOSE COUNTIES. ARE GOING TO DEPEND ON. FITS IN THE- COMMUNITY. BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING ALL FAMILIES FACED THIS ISSUE. FINDING HERE. DURING THE HOURS AND DAYS. THERE NEEDS. AND WHO. OFFER THEM SIR. OF I EVEN DAYS THE LATE NEXT. SECOND THAT WE WOULD WE HAVE FAMILIES COME WITH THAT MEANS HIS BOOK THE OF YOUR CHILDREN- WE SEE IN DASH. THE MUCH OF REQUEST THAT COME TO US MORE QUALITY CARE. R. FOR HIM LEARNERS THEREFORE THE EFFECTIVE TODDLER POPULATION WITH LITTLE MORE THAN. 70% OFTEN. CALL FROM LOOKING FOR IN THE LEARNERS AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE CARE THAT'S AVAILABLE WITHIN THE LICENSE KEY SACRAMENTO ONLY ABOUT 25230% OF THE LICENSE SPACES ARE AVAILABLE. HERE THIS MEANS A MAJORITY CARE FOR OUR YOUNGEST LEARNERS IS HAPPENING IN THE FAMILY CHILD CARE HOME PROVIDER COMMUNITY AND THE FAMILY AND YOU WERE. WE SAW BEEN SOME RECENT DATA FROM. TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN TO TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE- OUR CENTER POPULATION THAT MEANS THERE'S NEED FOR INCREASED INFANT CARE IN OUR FAMILY CHILD HERE. AND ANOTHER ISSUE THAT AMNESTY SAYS THEY'RE SEEKING NOT CARE TO MEET THEIR NEEDS HIS LANGUAGE HERE IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY WE HAVE ABOUT SIXTY. 71% OF OUR LICENSE IN OUR PROGRAMS SPEAKING ENGLISH ONLY- THIS CAN BE A CHALLENGE IN A VERY- FAMILIES. WHO MAYBE AREN'T QUITE COMFORTABLE OR PERHAPS MORE PEOPLE WORKING IN THE READING SPEAKING- FAMILY WAS LOOKING FOR SERVICES PROVIDED. THANK YOU. THE CHALLENGE HERE IS THIS THIS IS OFTEN EXTENDS BEYOND INTERPRETATION SERVICES AND- INCLUDES THE. CULTURAL UNDERSTAND. SO WE NEED FAMILIES STRUGGLE WITH THE THANK YOU WHAT THAT MIGHT LOOK LIKE YEAH. THE CARE HOME WHERE THIS COMES WE THE- AND PROVIDERS AND NOW WHO ARE LOOKING FOR HEREWHAT WE SEE MORE. IS THIS NEED FROM PROVIDERS FIND BALANCE. FOR THEMSELVES BOTH THEIR WORK LIFE AND CARING FOR YOUNG CHILDREN- ALSO FAMILIES OF THEIR OWN THAT ARE. SO THAT RIGHT NOW WILL OFFER. AN OFFER THE COMMITMENTS THEY MADE TO FAMILIES TO CARE FOR HIS FAMILY BUT ALSO KEEP THEIR OWN THEM IN MIND. THE OTHER UP. IS THAT WE SEE COME UP FOR PROVIDERS IS WITH THEIR OWN BUSINESS OPERATIONS THESE ARE SMALL BUSINESSES THEY DO HAVE A REVENUE SOURCE THAT REVENUE SOURCES OFTEN- DATE CHILDREN ENROLLED IN YOUR PROGRAM- SO FINDING A WAY. TO CONTINUE BEING AVAILABLE BASED ON A FAMILY NEEDS- THEM IF IT'S A- FAMILY WITH OUR OUR CARE NONTRADITIONAL HOURS HERE WE CAN HEAR EACH YEAR- IN EVEN THOSE FAMILIES THAT ACCESS SOME OF THE MORE TRADITIONAL PROGRAMS MODELS. AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS OR SPENDING LEARNING PROGRAMS THAT WOULD PROVE THAT SOME ARE CALLING ARE WORKING HARD TO OFFER THOSE SAME FAMILIES ALSO HAVE NEEDS THAT EXTEND BEYOND. THAT TRADITIONAL HOURS HERE MANY OF THEM ARE LYING ON OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS OTHER SYSTEMS OR GET THEIR CHILDREN TO BRAHMS PROGRAMS OFTEN THERE BE. SCHOOL OR WORK- BILLS HOURS EXTEND BEYOND TRADITIONAL OUR PROGRAMMER EVEN SOME OF THE TRANSPORTATION. CHALLENGES THAT HEARING FROM THEM. THE CHALLENGES OCCUR THE BOARD FINDING HERE THAT NEEDS THEIR NEEDS WHILE TO BUILD RELATIONS WITH PROVIDER. ALSO NEEDS THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO BALANCE AND MATCH THOSE NEEDS TO OUR FAMILY OF COURSE THE MOST RECENT PANDEMIC CREATES ISSUES NEW AGENTS FOR PROVIDERS AND FAMILIES. WITH SOME OF THE HYBRID MODELS OF WORK WHEN THE REMOTE WORKING POSSIBILITIES WHERE NOW THE CHILDREN WHO WERE ONCE IN HERE. FOR LONGER PERIODS OF TIME PERHAPS TO DROP IN STATUS IS NEEDED FROM FIVE PM TO SCHEDULE TO A TWO DAY A WEEK SCHEDULE SO CERTAINLY A LOT OF CHALLENGES FACING FAMILIES AND A LOT OF CHALLENGES FACING PROVIDERS. THAT THEY STRUGGLE TO KEEP THEIR DOORS OPEN AND THE NEEDS OF. THE SAME FAMILY. WHAT WE KNOW IS- FAMILIES ARE MAKING WORK AND THESE ARE. RESILIENT THE A. ARE DOING THE BEST THEY CAN. EVEN IN THE FACE OF THESE CHALLENGES NO WE ALSO RECOGNIZES THE STILL NEED THE HARD WORK OF. PARTNERS SPEAKERS BEFORE ME AND EVERYONE HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THE BEST. POSSIBLE CARE OPTIONS FOR THEIR YOUNG CHILDREN AND MURDERS OF OUR- MMHM. SO WITH THAT I CONCLUDE MY COMMENTS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE APPRECIATE THAT MR GARCIA NEVER GONNA MOVE TO LILY MARQUEZ ONE OF OUR PARENTS MS MARQUEZ POPE PLEASE PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. GOOD MORNING HELLO MY NAME IS LI MY KIDS I AM A LEADER WITH PARENT VOICES WITH EXPENSIVE COACH AFTER. MOST IMPORTANTLY ON THE CHARACTERISTICS YOU'LL BE JEREMIAH THAT IS IN THE FIRST GRADE AND A FIVE YEAR OLD. THAT MEANS ME A FELLOW WENT TO COMPETE IN THE GARDEN. AND WE LIVE IN SAN FRANCISCO CALIFORNIA EXPERIENCE HAVING A CHILD IN THE OPEN AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS AS WELL AS A CHILD ENROLLED. IN A PRESCHOOL PROGRAM. WHEN MY SON STARTED ELEMENTARY. SCHOOL IN PERSON WITH WITH A COUPLE OF WEEKS HE HAD BEEN- DOING VIRTUAL OFFENDER INTO. KINDERGARTEN YEAR PRETTY MUCH THE FIRST EIGHT MONTHS OF IT- I REALIZED THAT MY SON NEEDED A LOT OF HELP AND ASSISTANCE. I CAN AFFORD CHILDCARE WHEN THEY WERE SMALLER SO I QUIT MY JOB AND I MADE SEVERAL SACRIFICES TO STAY WITH THEM UNTIL THEY WERE ABLE TO GO TO SCHOOL. SO WHEN MY KIDS ARE LOOKING TO BUY. REALIZED THAT HE WAS AT A HUGE DISADVANTAGE BECAUSE HE DIDN'T HAVE ANY EARLY EDUCATION SETTING A BACKGROUND. SO IT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME SCHOOL PROGRAM FOR HIM HE HAS AN I. P. AND I LOOK AT THE TV EVEN WORKING FINE AS HE STRUGGLED WITH THE MOST MONEY. AND THAT WAS A HUGE SETBACK FOR HIM. SO AT THE WORST TIME TO APPLY FOR THE FOR AND PROGRAMS I BEGAN ASKING QUESTIONS AND RESEARCHING PROGRAMS AROUND. OUR NEIGHBORHOOD AND THE SCHOOL. FORTUNATELY I WAS ABLE TO FIND A PROGRAM WITH PRETTY EARLY IN THE PROCESS THE LIKE QUICKLY COMMUNICATED WITH THEM THE MINUTE OUR APPLICATION. AND MY FAMILY MET THE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA SO I WAS ABLE TO GET THE KIDS IN AN AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM AT NO COST PLUS. WITH THE BLESSING. AND I'M BARELY STARTING TO FOCUS ON MYSELF OF MY FAMILY. MAKE THEM GROW AND THEN. THE APPLICATION HOWEVER FOR THEM TO GET THEM IN THOSE PROGRAMS WAS NOT EASY THERE WAS A LOT OF REQUIRED BEFORE BACKING FOR COMMUNICATION WITH THE STAFF- KOBE MADE IT VERY DIFFICULT BECAUSE- THE ACCESSIBILITY AND LIMITED HOURS AND FAT STORAGE SHORTAGES THAT THERE WERE- BUT I MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAD EVERYTHING AT THE END OF IT. THE COMPLETE EVERYTHING IN ONE BECAUSE. IT HAPPENS A LOT THE BILLABLE. ALTHOUGH I VERY TO HAVE HAD ACTED AT THE LOCAL AT MY SON'S ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. IT WAS CLEAR THAT THEY WERE. ARE YOU LIMITED IN WHAT THEY CAN OFFER BECAUSE THE EXHIBITION FUNDING AND STAFF SHORTAGES. THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO HELP MY FRIEND HIS MARK. AS THEY ONLY HAD ENOUGH STAFF MEETING THE BASIC THE PROVISION OF CHILDREN AND NOT OFFERING ONE ON ONE FOR HELP HIM S MUCH I DO- YOU KNOW THAT IT MAKES THINGS A LITTLE HARDER FOR US. OUR DAYS ARE REALLY LONG. NOT ON BOARD FOR FIRST GRADERS ALONG OTHER CHILDREN- WHEN THE WHOLE THEY'RE BASICALLY OVER. AND THEN THE SEVERAL HOURS IN THE AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM IS DIFFICULT I ALSO KNOW THAT MY SON IS A VERY FIFTY BODY. AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM THAT HAS INCORPORATED PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. THE GETTING USED TO HIS BODY WOULD BE GREAT. AND ALSO GOOD FOR HIS HEALTH. IN A PERFECT WORLD AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS WOULD BE FUNDED BALANCE THE PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES WITH HOMEWORK SUPPORT IF YOU GET THE CHANCE TO START THEIR BODIES AND BRAINS. AGAIN I DON'T BLAME THE AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM TEACHER THEY DO A GREAT JOB WITH MY SON. BUT IT'S NOT FAIR TO EXPECT THEM TO BUY THE WHOLE POINT OF IT ALL THAT MUCH. I JUST WISH THAT THEY HAD THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO SUPPORT IT CHILD'S INDIVIDUAL. AS I MENTIONED MY FINEST BEHIND ACADEMICALLY AND HAVE THE NINETY. WHICH IS NEEDED TO GET SERVICES. THE SERVICES NEEDED TO TRANSITION THE JANUARY BUT HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO GET THEM. BECAUSE OF THE STAFF SHORTAGE AND THE LACK OF RESOURCES. I'M CONCERNED THAT I WASN'T WHAT ABOUT THIS RECENTLY- AND IN ALL HONESTY I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT NINETY EIGHT SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE IN WRITING AND IT'S A BINDING AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE FAMILY. OR THE DISTRICT. ACCORDING TO THE SCHOOL. THERE AREN'T ENOUGH RESOURCES OR STAFF TO HELP MY CHILD WITH ME. IT HAS BEEN VERY DISHEARTENING AND DEVASTATING. BUT I'M TRYING MY BEST ADVOCATE MY FRIEND AND I WILL DO THAT ALL ALWAYS. WELL MY TWENTY FIRST GRADE MY DAUGHTER STILL IN PRESCHOOL ALTHOUGH SHE WAS ELIGIBLE I WAS NOT ABLE TO GET A FALL FOR HER AND IF HE YOU NEAR OUR HOME. AND WE WILL OFFER TO BUY ACROSS TOWN THANK. I REALLY THINK PRIORITY SHOULD BE GIVEN HELLO HOTEL DEPARTURE FOR AN OLDER SIBLING OR NOTHING FOUR OR EIGHT. AT THE VERY LEAST THE NEAREST YOU OR NEAR THEIR RESIDENCE. BUT THE FULL PLACEMENT FROM MY UNDERSTANDING OF SOMETHING THAT THE FABRIC FOR. DISTRICT HAS HAD A BIG CHALLENGE WHAT. I COMMUNICATED A WHILE AGO WITH THE PEOPLE NEAR OUR HOME WHICH I HAD BEEN ON A WAIT LIST FOR TWO YEARS. AND LAST YEAR I GOT A CALL THAT THERE WAS A BIG OPEN. BY COMMUNICATED WITH THE TICKET FOR THAT MY DAUGHTER WAS INVOLVED IN THAT WAS AN ISSUE IN ITSELF. ALTHOUGH I WASN'T GOING TO BE PROBLEMATIC THE REALITY WAS THAT I NEEDED THE PEACE OF MIND AND HAVING FOUR KIDS IN DIFFERENT SCHOOLS AND FAR FROM EACH OTHER. IT'S JUST A BIG BURDEN FOR OUR FAMILY. I FEEL FORTUNATE TO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET A FAITH IN THE PEOPLE PROVIDED BOTH FOR ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN OUR HOME. SO IT TOOK SEVERAL EMAIL CALL. MAKE THAT CHANGE BUT I WOULD PREFER THAT I WOULD BE ABLE TO DO IT. WITHOUT THAT IF YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH MORE STRESSFUL ESPECIALLY WITH GAS PRICES. BEING AT ALL TIME HIGH. I WOULD HAVE TO DRIVE OR FIND TRANSPORTATION FOR DIFFERENT PART OF THE CITY AND STRUGGLE WITH THAT. JUST TO CARE FOR MY DAUGHTER. OR SPEND TIME AND ENERGY FIFTEEN PER PROVIDER FOR FIGHTING THE CHANGES THAT MET MY FAMILY. THIS SYSTEM AS IT IS SET UP BASICALLY CALLED GUARANTEE FIGURE OUT A- THEIR OWN. FORTUNATELY MY KIDS ARE CLOSE IN AGE. THAT'S THIS CALL CAN CONTACT THIS TALENTED BUT THEN THERE'S ALSO THE BENEFITS OF THAT TOO. BUT I KNOW IT'S EVEN HARDER FOR PARENTS WITH MORE OF AN AGE GAP BETWEEN THEIR KID. IF MY DAUGHTER WAS TWO FOR EXAMPLE I KNOW I WOULD HAVE A LOT MORE MORE TO WORRY ABOUT. IT'S REALLY A POINT TO HAVE A DEVELOPMENT. FINANCE DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE HEALTHCARE FOR KIDS OF ALL AGES. NEARBY PRESCHOOL ELEMENTARY SCHOOL MIDDLE SCHOOL. HIGH SCHOOL THE PARENTS WOULD HAVE TO TRAVEL FAR. OR WAIT ON WE LISTS TO HELP CARE FOR THEIR CHILDREN. THIS IS WHY IT'S CRITICAL TO RAISE THE REIMBURSEMENT RATE FOR CHILDCARE PROVIDERS AS WE ADD MORE STOCK. HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS HAVE BEEN DEVASTATED WITH THE PANDEMIC AND EVEN BEFORE THAT. THEY WERE SEVERELY UNDER EIGHT. IF WE DON'T RAISE THE REIMBURSEMENT RATE PROVIDERS WILL CONTINUE TO CLOSE AND IT WILL BE EVEN HARDER FOR FAMILIES. FOR FAMILIES LIKE MINE TO FIND HEALTH CARE FOR THEIR YOUNG. WHEN YOU BUY THE HOME. THANKS TO THE WORK FOR THE BOARD OF THE OLDER KIDS. AS I SAID I FEEL FORTUNATE TO HAVE BOTH OF MY KIDS LEARNING- FOR. NEAR ONE ANOTHER. I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT IT TOOK A LOT OF MY TIME AND EFFORT TO MAKE THAT WORK. AND NOW. THAT'S NOT HOW IT SHOULD BE. I ALSO HAVE CONCERNS OF MAKING THAT CHANGE DEPENDING WHICH MY DAUGHTER FROM T. CASE. I'M A TEACHER OKAY GREAT C. K. TO A PREPAY BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT SHE WOULD PROBABLY LEARN MORE MORE STUFF IN. A SETTING BUT- WHEN I PUT. YOU WITH THE COMMUTE AND TRANSPORTATION AFFECT MY FAMILY. BUT OVERALL SYSTEM THE OFFICE WOULD BE FOR. I ALSO KNOW THAT IT'S NOT THE CASE SAM. HOWEVER AND I HOPE THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY MAKE THINGS EASIER FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. FAMILIES TO HELP THEM WITH THEIR NEEDS FOR THE FAMILY BY IN A WORLD WHERE THERE'S- SO MUCH UNCERTAINTY BUT YET I HOLD ON FOR A LOT OF HOPE. THAT THINGS WILL WORK OUT. AND THEN MAKE A LEFT MANY CHILDREN AT A DISADVANTAGE WITH REGARD TO MENTAL SOCIAL HEALTH. AND ECONOMIC ISSUES SUCH AS MARTIN LAW. AND THAT IS WHY IT'S IMPORTANT FOR CHILDREN TO HAVE THE RESOURCES THEY NEED. TO HAVE A HOLISTIC APPROACH IN ORDER FOR THEM TO THRIVE. IN THIS ENVIRONMENT HI. AND IN IT. AT THE CENTRAL. I'M THE CHARACTER HELP THE CAMPUS IS WITH EVERY PENNY THEY ARE OUR FUTURE. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND ALLOWING ME TO SHARE MY STORY. THANK YOU MISS MARQUEZ WE APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AND YOUR STORY AS WELL. MEMBERS WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO OUR LAST PANEL WHICH INCLUDES PARTNERSHIP FOR CHILDREN AND YOUTH AND THE CHILD CARE RESOURCE CENTER WELCOME WE'LL BEGIN WITH MS GUNDERSEN PLEASE PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. THE MORNING MEMBERS I'M JUST GONNA PULL UP AND A POWER POINT TO GIVE ME ONE MOMENT. THANK YOU. GREAT GOOD MORNING MEMBERS MY NAME IS JESSICA GUNDERSEN WITH THE PARTNERSHIP FOR CHILDREN AND YOUTH THE PARTNERSHIP FOR CHILDREN AND YOUTH IS AN ADVOCACY AND CAPACITY BUILDING ORGANIZATION. DEDICATED TO A FUTURE WHERE ALL CHILDREN REACH THEIR FULL POTENTIAL THROUGH EQUITABLE ACCESS. TO LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES AND SUPPORT OF SCHOOLS. WE ALSO COORDINATE THE AFTERSCHOOL CALIFORNIA AFTER SCHOOL ADVOCACY ALLIANCE A COALITION OF EXPANDED LEARNING PROVIDERS AND CHILD ADVOCACY ORGANIZATIONS THAT SERVE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. EVERYDAY RELY ON PUBLICLY FUNDED EXPANDED LEARNING PROGRAMS. I'M AND WHILE MY COLLEAGUE AND I ARE GOING TO DISCUSS SOME OF THE CHALLENGES WHICH MUCH OF WHAT YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD AND THE POLICY OPPORTUNITIES WE REALLY WANT TO START WITH THE BIG OPPORTUNITIES BEFORE US AND REALLY THINK THE LEGISLATURE. ON ALL THE MEMBERS HERE TODAY AND THE ADMINISTRATION FOR FIRST AND FOREMOST HUGE INVESTMENTS THAT MANY OF US HAVE BEEN FIGHTING DECADES FOR TO PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY EARLY LEARNING CARE AND EXPANDED LEARNING PROGRAMS TO ALL FAMILIES. THESE INVESTMENTS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BE A GAME CHANGER TO ENSURE ALL STUDENTS AND FAMILIES THRIVE AND SUCCEED IN CALIFORNIA REGARDLESS OF INCOME GEOGRAPHY AND RACE. WE ALSO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND ADMINISTRATION I WAS RECOGNIZING THAT NON ACADEMIC FACTORS. SUCH AS HEALTH SOCIAL EMOTIONAL LEARNING TRAUMA ACCESS TO ENRICHMENT AND PLAY. ARE AS IMPORTANT AS TRADITIONAL SCHOOLING. TO REALLY MEANING PLEASE CLOSE GAPS AND IMPROVE OUTCOMES FOR ALL KIDS. AND LASTLY WE APPRECIATE THE EFFORT OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS- IN ADMINISTRATION AND IN FUNDING. TO SEEK TO INTEGRATE. AND BLOOD AND BRAVES WIDE VARIETY OF PROGRAMS THAT YOU HEARD- THAT'S SAD YOU KNOW WHOLE CHILD FULL DAY IN FULL YEAR APPROACH IS AN IDEAL AND IT REALLY WILL REQUIRE NEW WAYS OF OPERATING AND SPACE FOR INNOVATION. AND AS WE ALL KNOW STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES ARE KIND OF LIKE GIANT TAKERS AND NEW WAYS OF BUSINESS WILL TAKE TIME. AND REALLY AN ALL HANDS ON DECK APPROACH SO ONE I JUST THINK WE NEED TO KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS IS A TIME OF TRANSITION AND I WANT TO THANK ALL THE PANELISTS THAT CAME BEFORE ME WHO ARE REALLY EXPERTS IN THE SPACE AND I'VE LEARNED SO MUCH FROM AND I HOPE. THAT AS THINGS BEGIN TO OPEN UP MEMBERS AND STAFF THAT ARE LISTENING TODAY MAKE SURE THAT YOU GET OUT THERE AND GO SEE YOUR PROVIDERS IN ALL THESE DIFFERENT EXCITING- FOR THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS THE PARTNERSHIP FOR CHILDREN AND YOUTH. ARM AND THE CHILD CARE RESOURCE CENTER HAVE BEEN CONDUCTING RESEARCH. I'D BEEN BEATING DOZENS OF STATE AND LOCAL EXPERTS- AROUND A REAL LONG OVERDUE COMING TOGETHER BETWEEN OUR SECTORS THAT HAVE SO MUCH IN COMMON- AND THEN WE STARTED THIS WORK BEFORE KOBE OUR PARTNERSHIP WAS REALLY STRENGTHENS- WHEN OUR SECTORS WERE DETERMINED TO BE EXCEPTIONAL WHICH WE ALWAYS KNEW ESPECIALLY CHILDCARE AND BOTH OF OUR WORK FORCES I CANNOT SAY THIS ENOUGH ON THE FRONT LINES. CARING FOR KIDS EVEN WHEN SCHOOLS OPERATED REMOTELY. SO I WANT TO BRING UP THE SLIDE THAT REALLY STARTS WITH. THE POSITIVE WHICH IS OUR SECTORS HAVE MUCH MORE IN COMMON THAN KNOCKS I'M NOT GONNA READ. ALL EVERYTHING LISTED HERE BUT WHAT I WANT FOLKS TO SEE IS THAT BOTH THE EXPANDED LEARNING SECTOR AND THE EARLY LEARNING AND CHILDCARE SECTOR HAVE ASSETS SO WE KNOW THAT THE C. HAS REALLY REALLY STRONG. QUALITY ASSESSMENTS AND TOOLS THEY HAVE A WIDE VARIETY OF MODELS FOR FAMILIES AS WELL AND THEY HAVE A DEEP HISTORY OF REALLY HAVING A FAMILY FOCUS AND THEN YOU LOOK AT THE EXTENDED LEARNING PROGRAMS AND THEY HAVE A VERY STRONG LINK TO THE SCHOOL DAY. AND THERE'S A LOT OF BENEFITS WIN PROGRAMS CAN BE OPERATED WHEN ADAMS SCHOOL SITES AS WELL- AND THOUGH WE HAD WE TEND TO HAVE MORE PART TIME WORKERS AS WELL. AND THEN LET'S FOCUS ON REALLY THE INTERSECTION WHICH IS AGAIN WHILE WE ARE WHY WE ARE TALKING ABOUT APPROACHING FAMILIES MORE HOLISTICALLY- AS WELL AS- HOW MUCH THESE SECTORS HAVE IN COMMON RIGHT I'M REALLY THESE SECTORS ARE FOUNDED ON PRIORITIZING THOSE MOST UNDERSERVED. CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. WE HAVE A VERY DIVERSE AND COMMUNITY GROUNDED WORK FORCE WHICH IS A HUGE ASSET- BOTH OF OUR SECTORS ARE REALLY GROUNDED AND CHILD AND YOUTH DEVELOPMENT- AND WE ALL KNOW. THAT DOSAGE IN QUALITY MATTERS WHICH IS WHY RATES MATTER SO MUCH- WE ALSO HAVE A LOT OF SHARED CHALLENGES WHEN IT COMES TO COMPENSATION SO REALLY FOUNDATIONAL LEVI DO HAVE MORE IN COMMON THAN NOT- THAT BEING SAID YOU KNOW JUST BECAUSE WE HAVE A LOT IN COMMON DOESN'T MEAN IT MAKES IT EASY TO BLEND IN GRAY. WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE WORKING TOWARDS SO. YOU'VE HEARD AN OVERVIEW OF THE PROGRAM- AS WE WORKED OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS. WE STARTED TO TRY TO DEVELOP A MAP BECAUSE- JUST TO ILLUSTRATE WHAT THIS MAZE IS THAT I KNOW THERE'S A LOT COMING OUT MEMBERS AND STAFF BUT- I WANT TO SEE THAT AS YOU LOOK FROM LEFT TO RIGHT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO SEE IS LIKE WHAT IS THE CONTINUE M. FOR YOUNG PEOPLE. AND AS THEY GET OLDER AND IF YOU THIS MAZE IS DIFFICULT FOR US TO SEE IF YOU CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT IT MIGHT BE FOR A FAMILY- OR AN ADMINISTRATOR OF THESE PROGRAMS AND SO SOME OF THE THINGS I WANT TO CALL OUT HERE IS. WHEN YOU LOOK AT AGES I MEAN RATES THERE'S REALLY A WIDE VARIETY OF RATES- THOSE CHILDCARE IS UNDERFUNDED THEY AT LEAST ACCOUNT FOR REGIONAL DIFFERENCES THAT'S SOMETHING YOU HAVEN'T SEEN OR HEARD OF IT AFTER SCHOOL FOR A WHILE- AND SO. ANY ONE OF THESE ADMINISTRATORS MIGHT HAVE TO TAKE ON ALL TEN OF THESE PROGRAMS AND THE EXPECTED EXPECTED TO BLEND IN BRAID- AND AGAIN. RIGHT NOW. WE'RE NOT ALWAYS ALLOWED TO BLEND IN GREATER WORKFORCE FOR EXAMPLE THE QUALIFICATIONS ARE DIFFERENT SO WHY WE HAVE THESE HUGE STAFFING CHALLENGES. SOME OF OUR PROGRAM PROVIDERS ARE UNABLE TO SUBSTITUTION- BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE PROGRAMMER FIVE MINUTES AGAIN THESE REQUIREMENTS ARE IN PLACE FOR A REASON BUT WE MIGHT NEED TO STEP BACK AND RETHINK THINGS IF WE ARE ASKING FOLKS TO BLEND IN GRADE MORE AND MORE. YOU CAN ALSO SEE THAT THIS VARIETY OF PROGRAMS ARE OVERSEEN BY DIFFERENT ADMINISTRATING AGENCIES AND SO WHEN YOU ADD A LOT OF DIFFERENT. ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCIES YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT THE BURDEN THAT CAN HAPPEN ON PROVIDERS WHO AGAIN ARE TRYING TO FOCUS ON THE WHOLE CHILD. THE WHOLE FAMILY APPROACH- AND SO AGAIN WHILE WE THINK BLENDING AND BRAIDING SOUNDS GOOD AND IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO IT'S NOT AS EASY AS WE MAKE IT SEEM SO WE HOPE- AFTER THIS HEARING FOLKS CAN I DID GET A LITTLE BIT MORE TO THIS ROAD MAP AND THINK ABOUT HOW DO WE REMOVE. AND BARRIERS- AND SOME OF THE BLOCKS TO COME IN THINKING MORE HOLISTICALLY SO WITH THAT I'M GONNA PASS IT OFF TO THE CHILD CARE RESOURCE CENTER TO CLOSE THIS OUT WITH SOME HIGH LEVEL POLICY ISSUES AND OPPORTUNITIES. THAT THE COMMITTEE CAN CONSIDER THANK YOU. THANK YOU MS GUNDERSEN BEFORE WE GET TO YOU MESSNER INJURE I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT IS A GREAT CHART AND I LOVE YOUR POINT ABOUT IT'S HARD FOR US TO LOOK AT AND FIGURE IT OUT HOW IN THE WORLD IS APPARENT NAVIGATE THAT SO. FEW THAT BE HELPFUL GOING FORWARD. MS DONNA SKINNER. INJURE PLEASE PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. THE MORNING ALMOST AFTERNOON. I'M GONNA SALINGER AND I AM THE CHIEF STRATEGY OFFICER AT THE CHILD CARE RESOURCE CENTER. THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATOR FOR CONVENING THIS pISSUE WE'VE ALL WORKED ON. FOR THE PAST FEW YEARS AS JESSICA MENTIONED. CCRC IS A NONPROFIT COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION AND OUR MISSION IS TO CULTIVATE CHILD FAMILY AND COMMUNITY WELLBEING. WE ACHIEVE THESE GOALS BY ADMINISTERING A VARIETY OF STATE. FEDERAL AND LOCALLY FUNDED PROGRAMS INCLUDING CHILD CARE RESOURCE AND REFERRAL. ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT CAL WORKS SUBSIDIES HEAD START AND A VARIETY OF FAMILY RESOURCE AND WELL BEING SERVICES INCLUDING HOME VISITING MENTAL HEALTH CONSULTATION AND RESOURCE. I WE PROVIDE SERVICES FOR CHILDREN BIRTH OR- BIRTH THROUGH SCHOOL AGE AND THAT WAS REALLY WHAT BROUGHT US TO THE TABLE WITH P. C. Y. AS WE STARTED TO SEE. SO MANY CHALLENGES EMERGING CONSISTENTLY ACROSS THE FULL CONTINUUM. I'M WE ENTERED THIS UP WITH EYES WIDE OPEN- WE KNEW THIS WAS GOING TO BE A COMPLICATED CONVERSATION. AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE LABELING OF A PLANT THAT MIKE ERA. BECAUSE I DO FEEL LIKE BOTH THE CHILDCARE AND EARLY LEARNING SLASH THE- SECTORS ARE SWIMMING IN PLANNING RIGHT NOW. AND A LOT OF UNKNOWNS AND SO I'M GOING TO START OFF BY LOOKING UP SPECIFIC PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE IDENTIFIED. AND THEN I'M GOING TO MOVE INTO SOME POLICY ISSUES AND OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE ON THE ROAD A HAT. FIRST AND FOREMOST I'M THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT ADMINISTRATIVE BURDENS PLACED ON BOTH- ELEAZAR AND COMMUNITY BASED OPERATORS WHO ARE TRYING TO NAVIGATE THAT GRAPHIC THAT YOU JUST LOOKED AT- AND- CLEARLY WE'RE STRUGGLING TO TRY TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE A SEAMLESS SYSTEM TO PARENTS. BUT IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE WITH THE RULES THAT WERE GIVEN. THEY CREATE SYSTEMS WHICH WERE LIFTED UP BY CARLOS NINOS WHERE YOU HAVE KIDS WHO CAN ONLY BE IN ONE PART OF THIS A PROGRAM BECAUSE THE FUNDING THAT'S RECEIVED THERE WERE SECTIONING KIDS OFF FROM EACH OTHER- MAYBE TOGETHER DURING SCHOOL DURING THE DAY. AND THAT'S OFTEN HAPPENING BASED ON THESOCIO ECONOMICS OF THEIR FAMILY. I'M STUDENT SOME PROVIDERS ARE TREATED AND EQUALLY FOR COMPARABLE TYPES OF SERVICE DEPENDING ON THE DOOR THEY ENTER. WE HAVE MAJOR STAFFING SHORTAGES BOTH FOR RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION THAT UNDERMINED THE ABILITY. TO EXPAND ACCESS AND PROVIDE PROFESSIONAL STABILITY TO OUR WORKFORCE AND CONSISTENCY OF CARE TO OUR KIDS. THE DUKE THERE ARE DUPLICATIONS OF STATE LOCAL ADMINISTRATIVE ROLES IN SUFFICIENT AND DISCONNECTED DATA TRACKING WE'RE NEVER TALKED ABOUT IN THE SAME CONVERSATION. SO WE'RE ALWAYS TRYING TO PIECE IT TOGETHER AFTER THE FACT. WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS BECAUSE OF PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT. OUR PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT REALLY LIMITS WHAT ELEAZAR CAN DO HOW COMMUNITY BASED PROVIDERS CAN BE INVOLVED AND HOW WE CAN SHARE AND LEVERAGE RESOURCES. AND I THINK PARTICULARLY AS WE LOOK AT UNIVERSAL PRESCHOOL AND HOW WE'RE GOING TO MAXIMIZE OUR SYSTEMWE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TACKLE THIS CONVERSATION IT'S A PAINFUL CONVERSATION. I KNOW NO ONE LIKES THE- STATION BUT IT IS DEFINITELY THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THESE SYSTEMS. WE ALSO HAVE CAN IN OVER TIMELINE AND REQUIREMENTS TO IMPLEMENT CHANGES. WE HAVE- CHALLENGES WHERE WE REALLY DO NEED TO OFFER A FULL WORK DAY AND YEAR FOR WORKING PARENTS. AND WE'RE EXCITED THAT THE EARLY LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES PROGRAM IS STARTING TO LOOK AT NINE HOUR DAYS AND STARTING TO LOOK AT NON OPERATIONAL DAYS OF SCHOOL. BUT IT HAS TO BE ALL OF THOSE DAYS IT CAN'T JUST BE THIRTY ADDITIONAL DAYS. I PERSONALLY WHEN MY DAUGHTER WAS IN- ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SUMMER IS THE HARDEST TIME FOR PARENTS WHO HAVE AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CHILD. AND IF THEY DON'T HAVE A CONSISTENT ENROLLMENT AT A CHILD CARE PROGRAM AND THEY'RE TRYING TO GO OUT AND FIND CAMP OPTIONS OR OTHER OPPORTUNITIES IT'S REALLY A CHALLENGE. AND LASTLY IN THE PROBLEM SECTION THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF MONEY THAT'S GONE OUT TO LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES TO BE PART OF THIS PLAN. BUT THERE HAS BEEN NO MONEY GIVEN TO THE EARLY CHILDHOOD SYSTEM TO THE CHILD CARE SECTOR OR TOO EARLY EXPANDED LEARNING TO SIT AT THOSE TABLES. AND I CAN ONLY SPEAK FROM MY OWN ORGANIZATION AND SAYING THAT WE HAVE OVER FORTY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN OUR SERVICE AREA THAT'S A LOT OF TABLES. AND TO BE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY PARTNER AND BE THERE I'M IN A WAY THAT WE WANT TO SHOW UP WE CAN'T DO IT WITHOUT SUPPORT. SO AS EVERYONE HAS LIFTED UP WERE AT AN INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY MOMENTS WHERE THEN FLEXION POINT WHERE PEOPLE REALLY DO UNDERSTAND. THAT FAMILIES NEED THESE SERVICES CHILDREN NEED THESE SERVICES AND WE ALL HAVE TO ROLL OUR SLEEVES UP. AND WORK TOGETHER TO TRY TO MAKE THIS BETTER. SO SOME OF THE AREAS WHERE WE KNOW THERE ARE IMMEDIATE OPPORTUNITIES- ARE. CERTAINLY AROUND REIMBURSEMENT RATES. I'M WE ARE CURRENTLY LOOKING AT REIMBURSEMENT RATES AND A VRIETY OF DIFFERENT TASK FORCES AND WORKING GROUPS. NONE OF THEM ARE LOOKING ACROSS THE WHOLE CONTINUUM. EXPANDED LEARNING IS LEFT OUT. THERE ARE A DOLLARS NEEDED TO EXPAND THE LEARNING BETTER AND ASK OF LOCAL DISTRICTS TO BRING IN A MATCH. AND WHAT YOU END UP AS WITH TREMENDOUS INCONSISTENCIES ON WHAT WE PAY FOR THE BIRTH OF TWELVE CONTINUUM OF CARE. ONE OF THE EXAMPLES THAT I WANTED TO LIVE I HAVE IS FOR THE SAME AGE CHILD SO A SCHOOL AGE CHILD A TWO SECOND GRADER. IF THEY'RE IN AN EXPANDED LEARNING PROGRAM THE REIMBURSEMENT RATE IS ABOUT TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. IF THEY'RE IN THE SAME. PART TIME PROGRAM IN A CHILD CARE SYSTEM THE STATE REIMBURSEMENTS CLOSER TO TEN THOUSAND PER YEAR THAT'S A HUGE GAP IT'S A HUGE GAP AND IT CHANGES WHAT WE'RE ABLE TO OFFER. THE OTHER THING THAT WE ARE REALLY WORKING THROUGH AND WANT TO TALK TO POLICYMAKERS ABOUT. IS HOW DO WE HANDLE THE CONTINUUM OF CARE PARTICULARLY AROUND UNIVERSAL PRESCHOOL AND TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN THE NEEDS OF YOUNG ELEMENTARY STUDENTS AND TK'S STUDENTS ARE NOT. NECESSARILY A GOOD FIT FOR WHAT OUR TRADITIONAL AFTER SCHOOL MODEL HAS BEEN WITH HIGHER STAFFING RATIOS- THEY ARE NOT OLDER ELEMENTARY KIDS THEY'RE NOT SELF DIRECTED THERE NOT AT AN AGE WHERE THEY CAN DO THINGS INDEPENDENTLY. HOW ARE WE GOING TO SET UP AN AGE APPROPRIATE SYSTEM WHERE THOSE CHILDREN RECEIVE THE APPROPRIATE SUPERVISION AND CARE AND ARE IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT AFTER SCHOOL. WE ALSO NEED TO INCLUDE. A NEW VISION FOR BUILDING THE WORK FORCE A LOT OF THIS IS REALLY HINGES ON HOW MUCH WE PAY PEOPLE IF WE DON'T PAY PEOPLE A REASONABLE WAGE. LET ALONE A LIVING WAGE- WE CAN'T RECRUIT PEOPLE INTO THIS INDUSTRY AND WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH. SO I THINK IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE REALLY THINK ABOUT. THE WORKFORCE WERE BRINGING AND HOW WE IDENTIFY PEOPLE WHO HAVE AN INTEREST IN INTENTIONALITY AND SKILLS IN WORKING WITH YOUNG CHILDREN. AND HOW WE INCLUDE THEM IN WHATEVER SYSTEM IT IS WE'RE GOING TO BUILD. WE ARE- LOOKING AT THE MASTER PLANNED FOR EARLY LEARNING AND MANY OF US HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS CONTINUING EFFORT WE'RE DISAPPOINTED THAT EXPANDED LEARNING WAS NOT INCLUDED. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS WE LOOK AT THE WHOLE SYSTEM AND THE WHOLE CONTINUUM OF CARE BECAUSE IF YOU MAKE CHANGES ONLY ONE AGE GROUP. OR IN ONLY ONE PROGRAM THERE ARE RIPPLE EFFECTS THAT ARE FELT OUT. AND TO MAKE CHANGES AND IGNORE THAT- IS SURE IT IT LEAVES US COMING UP SHORT ALL OF THE TIME. WE REALLY ENCOURAGE THAT THERE BE POLICIES CONSIDERED TO REQUIRE INSTEAD OF INCENTIVIZE DATA SHARING TECHNICAL SYSTEMS AND COLLABORATIVE MESSAGING- WE LIVE ACROSS TWO STATE AGENCIES. ALWAYS HAVE MY GUESS IS ALWAYS WELL AND IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE ALL WORK TOGETHER TO TRY TO DO THAT. AND I'M- YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN STUDYING THIS FOR A LONG TIME AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND. IMAGINE IF YOUR FAMILY AND YOU'RE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND AND NAVIGATE. SO IF THE OTHER AREAS FOR POTENTIAL- ASSISTANCE WOULD BE TO CONSIDER MORE ONE TIME FUNDS. AND GOINGDIRECTLY TO CEOS TO HELP THEM BE AT THESE TABLES AND BUILD OUT THESE PROGRAMS. AND LOOK AT PROTECTING FUNDING TO ALLOW IT TO ROLL OVER AND EXTENDABLE IMITATION TIMELINE. I THINK OU HEARD FROM ALL OF OUR SERVICE OPERATORS THERE UNDER THE GUISE. AND THEY NEED MORE TIME AND MORE EXPERTISE. AND WE NEED TO GIVE THEM THE TIME TO DO THAT. AND LASTLY DURING THIS OVERWHELMING AND EXCITING EXPANSION OF T. K. THE STATE. DO SOME WORK TO CREATE HIGH LET'S. WITH THE SUBSET OF ELEAZAR CBO'S AND CO EASE- THAT WOULD INCREASE FLEXIBILITY TO WAIVE CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS SO WE CAN TEST OUT WHAT MIGHT WORK- YOU HAVE ENGAGED OPERATORS YOU HEARD FROM MANY OF THEM HERE TODAY WHO WOULD BE WILLING TO TRY THINGS. WE CAN LOOK AT REMOVAL OF CERTAIN STAFFING REQUIREMENTS TO SEE WHAT DIFFERENCE THAT MIGHT MAKE HOW COULD WE LOOK AT THE- REQUIREMENTS FOR C. C. T. ARE THE CENTER BASED PROGRAMS AND THEIR FACILITY REQUIREMENTS THAT WOULD MAKE IT APPROPRIATE FOR ALL THESE AGES. WE NEED TO ALLOW PROGRAMS TO GROUP BY AGE NOT BY FUNDING STREAMS WE CAN TRY THAT OUT. AND WE NEED TO CREATE INCENTIVES FOR L. E. A. N. C. B. O. PARTNERSHIPS TO MAXIMISE EQUITY AND LIFT UP THE WHOLE CONTINUE I'M OF THE SYSTEM. WE REALLY APPRECIATE ALL THE GOOD THINKING THAT WENT INTO THE STEERING AND THE TREMENDOUS PALACE AND WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH DONNA YOU ALSO ARE SPOT ON YOU TOTALLY GET THESE ISSUES AND- WE REALLY APPRECIATE ALL OF YOUR HELP AS WERE NAVIGATING- HOW WE BEST CAN BE HELPFUL. ALL RIGHT MEMBERS WE ARE MOVING INTO QUESTIONS AND I WOULD LIKE TO INVITE THE PUBLIC WANTING TO PARTICIPATE TO CALL IN NOW. PLEASE DIAL THE TOLL FREE NUMBER. 844-291-4185 WHEN PROMPTED. PLEASE USE THIS ACCESS CODE. FOUR SIX SIX THREE NINE SIX EIGHT WE WILL NOW BRING THE DISCUSSION BACK TO OUR MEMBERS I SEE SENATOR PAM AND THEN SENATOR COOK CORTESE PLEASE PROCEED SENATOR PAM YES. THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH AND AGAIN REALLY APPRECIATE THE- THE PRESENTATIONS WE HEARD TODAY AND I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF- SYSTEMS ISSUES AND ORGANIZATIONAL ISSUES. BUT I DID WANT TO ASK A QUESTION I THINK- HONEST MERRIER TOUCHED A BIT ON THIS IT IS A DEVELOPMENTAL PEDIATRICIAN AND- FATHER. WHEN THINGS IS WE'RE ROLLING OUT OUR EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION PROGRAM IS TO RECOGNIZE THAT- THE FOCUS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION IS A BIT DIFFERENT- FOR TO BE EFFECTIVE COMPARED TO WHAT WE NEED FOCUS LET'S SAY AN OLDER CHILDREN'S SCHOOL AS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL KIDS- THE RESEARCH ON EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION. HAS SHOWN THAT OF COURSE HAS A TREMENDOUS IMPACT ON THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT BUT THAT IMPACT IS ACTUALLY NOT THE FOCUS ON ACADEMICS IT'S A FOCUS ON. ESSENTIALLY SOCIALIZATION. N. FACTORS SOME MORE RECENT RESEARCH SHOWING THAT- PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN MORE FOCUSED ON ACADEMICS EARLY ON ACTUALLY ARE NOT HAVING THE LONG TERM RESULTS THAT WE SAW WITH THE OTHER RESEARCH THAT- THE PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS. SO YES MY QUESTION REALLY IS THAT AND I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF COMPLEXITIES AND I ALSO HEARD FROM THE FOLKS SAYING LIKE WE'RE TRANSPLANTED UP THESE PROGRAMS VERY QUICKLY AND SO FORTH. IS THAT HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT. THE FOCUS OF THESE PROGRAMS ARE DOING T. K. AND- YOU KNOW ALL THESE OTHER THINGS THAT IS ACTUALLY- THAT THE PROGRAMS THEMSELVES ARE PARTICULARLY FOCUSED ON- SOCIALIZATION LET ME JUST GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE IS AGAIN TALKING ABOUT THE MORE RECENT RESEARCH. IT WAS FASCINATING ABOUT IT WAS THAT ONE OF THE THINGS HE POINTED OUT WAS THAT IF THE BATHROOMS ARE TOO FAR AWAY. AND THE TEACHERS HAVE TO GROUP THE KIDS TO GET THEM TO THE BATHROOM AND STUFF WHAT MAKES THEM STAND IN LINE SOMETHING THAT'S NOT A BIG ISSUE IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. THIS OVER REGIMENTATION THAT COULD HAPPEN. JUST BECAUSE OF THE STRUCTURAL WAY THE- THE STRUCTURAL. LAYOUT OF THE FACILITY. ACTUALLY YOU COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT OR TAKE AWAY THE POSITIVE EFFECTOF. EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION. SO I KNOW IT'S ALREADY COMPLICATED ENOUGH AS IT IS NOW I'M TALKING ABOUT WELL HOW DO YOU LAY OUT YOUR FACILITIES HOW DO YOU TRAIN YOUR TEACHERS BUT I DO WANNA BE SURE THAT. WE ARE GETTING THE MOST FROM OUR INVESTMENT IN THAT WE ARE HAVING THE POSITIVE. OUTCOMES THAT WE'VE THAT THE PREVIOUS RESEARCH HAS SHOWN SO- I'M NOT SURE WHO TO DIRECT A QUESTION TO THE HEAD- YEAH I DIDN'T. I GUESS I DIDN'T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO INSURERS WERE YOU KNOW SPENDING ON BASS MEANT THAT WE ARE STRUCTURING THE PROGRAMS IN A WAY. THAT HAS THE BEST BENEFIT FOR THE KIDS THAT WERE ROLLING. THANK YOU SENATOR PENN WE'LL START WITH MRS NARINDER AND IF THERE'S ANYONE ELSE WHO WANTS TO JUMP IN PLEASE RAISE YOUR HAND. PLEASE GO AHEAD ON. I THINK THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATOR PAN FOR A LIFTING UP ONE OF THE THINGS I SPEND A LOT OF NIGHTS A WEEK AND THINKING ABOUT. I WE ARE. ALSO LOOKING VERY CLOSELY AT THE RECENT RESEARCH THAT CAME OUT ABOUT THE IMPACTS THE UNINTENDED IMPACTS OF EARLY ACADEMICS INCLUDING YOUNG CHILDREN IN SETTINGS THAT WORKED JUST FINE FOR THEM. AND I THINK THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS BEEN OF GREAT CONCERN TO ME IS HOW DO WE- CREATE EARLY LEARNING AND EXPANDED WORKING ENVIRONMENTS THAT ARE. DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE. AND DO ALL THE THINGS WE KNOW YOUNG KIDS NEED- YOU KNOW I MADE MY COLLEAGUES WILL LAUGH AT ME BUT FOUR YEAR OLD CHILDREN THEY NEED NAPS THEY NEED SNACKS THEY NEED SOMEBODY TO CARE FOR THEM AND THEY NEED SOMEBODY WHO'S GOING TO YOU KNOW PICK THEM UP IF THEY STUMBLE. AND PROVIDE THEM WITH THE WARMTH AND CARING THAT IS GOING TO HELP THEM GROW AND DEVELOP AS YOU MENTIONED IN THE SOCIAL SKILLS AND I THINK THAT WE HAVE- A LOT OF WORK TO DO TO THINK ABOUT OUR APPROACH TO PRESCHOOL AND MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE NOT GOING DOWN THE ROAD OF PUTTING TOO MANY ACADEMICS IN FRONT OF THESE CHILDREN TOO SOON AND BURNING THEM OUT. AND I ALSO WAS ALARMED BY THE SIMPLE THING OF BATHROOMS LIGHT I HAVE TALKED ABOUT TINY TOILET SO MUCH IN THE PAST TEN YEARS I CAN'T EVEN BEGIN TO TELL YOU HOW MUCH- BUT IT DOES MATTER IT TEACHES CHILDREN SELF REGULATION TEACHES CHILDREN HOW TO MANAGE THEIR OWN BODY. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MOST CONCERNS ME IS. WE'RE MOVING MORE AND MORE YOUNG CHILDREN INTO SETTINGS AND PROGRAMS THAT WERE DESIGNED FOR THAT. AND WE NEED TO HOLD UP INVESTIGATORS AND LIFT UP THE SPACES THAT WERE DESIGNED FOR THEM AND EXPAND THOSE OPPORTUNITIES. AND IT IS CLEARLY PART OF THIS CONTINUE- AND I THINK YOU SO MUCH FOR RAISING THE THING THAT'S BEEN KEEPING ME UP AT NIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS NEAR INJURE AND WE ALSO HAVE MISS CAPONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO COMMENT PLEASE PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY- THANKYOU SO MUCH FOR ASKING THE- THE QUESTION AND DONNA I SO APPRECIATE YOUR ANSWER- I THINK FOR TOO LONG WE'VE ASKED. HOW DO WE PREPARE SCHOOLS OUR CHILDREN TO BE READY FOR SCHOOLS RATHER THAN ASKING THE QUESTION OF HOW DO WE PREPARE SCHOOLS TO BE READY. TO RECEIVE THE CHILDREN WHO ARE JOINING THEM- AS AN EARLY EDUCATOR- I'VE BEEN AT THIS A VERY LONG TIME AND- I'VE READ A LOT OF RESEARCH AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT STICKS WITH ME CONSISTENTLY. IS THE WORK OF A CAUGHT SKI WHO SAYS THERE IS NOTHING THAT WE LEARN OUTSIDE OF THE CONTEXT OF A RELATIONSHIP. AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT. EVEN THE CONCEPT OF MORE CHILDREN LEARN MORE WHEN THE CHILD BESIDE THEM GETS MORE JUICE FIRST SNACK VENDING. ALL OF OUR LEARNING COMES IN THE SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS AND IF CHILDREN AREN'T SUPPORTED TO DEVELOP CLOSE SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS. THAT MAY LOSE THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN WE HAVE OTHERS- JUST LIKE WE FOCUS SO MUCH ENERGY ON WHAT IS THE MATH SKILLS A CHILD NEEDS TO LEARN WHAT IS THE LANGUAGE SKILL IT CHILD NEEDS TO LEARN. LEARNING SOCIAL SKILLS DON'T HAPPEN BY CHANCE LEARNING HOW TO BE PART OF THIS GROUP DOESN'T HAPPEN BY CHANCE. LEARNING HOW TO TAKE TURNS DOESN'T HAPPEN BY CHANCE IT IS DIFFICULT WORK THAT TAKES PLACE IN NURTURING ENVIRONMENTS WHO'S- TASK IS TO ME EMOTIONAL NEEDS OF CHILDREN SO THEY BECOME INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE EMOTIONAL WORLD THAT SURROUNDS THEM. BECAUSE IT IS NOT EMOTIONAL WORLD THAT IS GOING TO PROVIDE THE CONTEXT FOR CURIOSITY AND INVESTIGATION. ON AND I THINK THAT- WE HAVE TO STOP ASKING ON DOES YOUR CHILD KNOW THEIR LETTERS DOES THEY NOT DO THEY KNOW THEIR NUMBERS THEY WILL LEARN THEIR LETTERS AND NUMBERS WHEN IT BECOMES IMPORTANT TO THEM WITH IN A SOCIAL CONTEXT. KIDS WANT TO KNOW THEIR FRIENDS NAMES AND I FOCUSED ON SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT AND CHILD NAMES THEY'RE GOING TO LEARN THAT DONNA'S NAME STARTS WITH D. AND I'M GONNA BE EXCITED ABOUT THAT NOT BECAUSE OF THE LETTER D. BUT BECAUSE DONNA IS MY FRIEND. AND SHE HER NAME IS PART OF WHO SHE IS. THE OTHER THING OUT JUST SAYING CLOSING THIS MY BUTTON I COULD GO ON FOR EVER BUT ONE OF THE THINGS ONE WEEK KNOWLEDGE THE SOCIAL GROWTH THAT OCCURS IN THE EARLY YEARS IS WE BEGIN TO TEACH CHILDREN THAT THEY ARE IMPORTANT. THEY HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY AND THEY ARE WORTH LISTENING TO. AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IF YOU LOSE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SIT FOR CHILDREN TO SEE THEMSELVES AS POTENT. IN THIS WORLD. IN THE EARLY. IT IS X. DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO MAKE IT UP LATER. SO SOCIAL SKILLS ARE THE JOB THE WORK OF EARLY CHILDHOOD AND IT IS A JOYFUL WORK. AS OPPOSED TO IN THE MIDDLE WHERE NESS WHICH NOT SO MUCH. ON SEPT THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE MY OPINION. THANK YOU MS CAPONE A VERY VERY GOOD WORDS SENATOR PAT IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING ELSE YET. I FIRST I JUST WANT TO REALLY THINK. ABOUT IT THE ANSWERS- YET AS A DEVELOPMENTAL PEDIATRICIAN I WOULD SAY IS THAT THE RESEARCH IS CLEAR- THAT. IS THEY BOTH MENTIONED- SELF REGULATION SOCIALIZATION AND THEY'RE THEY'RE CRITICAL. PERIODS OF DEVELOPMENT THAT AND- THAT. KNOW THAT THAT PRESCHOOL AGE IT'S IT REALLY IS OUT SOCIAL SOCIALIZATION AND IN FACT IT HAS A VERY LONG TERM IMPACTS IN TERMS OF ABILITY YOU KNOW TO. WENT WITH KIDS IN HIGH SCHOOL AND BE ABLE TO GRADUATE HIGH SCHOOL AND- THEIR CHANCES OF GETTING A JOB LATER ON AND SO FORTH. AND SO I JUST HOPE THAT IS IN AND REALIZE THAT EVERYONE'S WORKING REALLY HARD AS WE'RE MAKING THESE INVESTMENTS WERE HAVING THE FOCUS WILL BE SURE WOULD DESIGN THE PROGRAMS IN A WAY THAT ADDRESSES THE ACT AND THE NEEDS OF. THE CHILDREN THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR PAN WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO SENATOR CORTESE PLEASE PROCEED FURTHER CORTESE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- GREAT CONVERSATION- IN A TWO I SUPPOSE COULD MAKE COMMENTS AND NUMBER AREAS BUT I WON'T TELL YOU JUST HAVE. A QUESTION- THAT GOES BACK TO ITEM TWO- UNIVERSAL A PRESCHOOL AND- PARTICULARLY IF. YEAH I GUESS THE TIME OF THE HEARING IS SO GOOD- FROM MY STANDPOINT- GIVEN THAT JUST IN THE LAST FEW DAYS. WE'VE BEEN- GETTING A LOT OF INCOMING COMMENTARY FROM- ARE ARE THE TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENTS- DOWN THE SAN JOSE AREA ESPECIALLY IN EAST SAN JOSE WERE- WE HAVE- LOW WEALTH SCHOOL DISTRICTS. AND ONE OF THE GRANT PROGRAMS SPECIFICALLY THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING AROUND TODAY THE UNIVERSAL PRE KINDERGARTEN PLANE IMPLEMENTATIONGRANT YOU KNOW HAS BEEN ALLOCATED- BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT HOW IT'S BEEN ALLOCATED IN THE FORMULA WHICH I THINK HAS BEEN AROUND FOR A LONG TIME- IT REALLY. I THINK BRINGS INTO QUESTION- THE QUESTION HOW CAN WE ENSURE EQUITY ACROSS ALL SCHOOLS IN IN TERMS OF OUR FUNDING ALLOCATIONS IN IT. AS YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK THIS IS- ANY KIND OF TRADITIONAL. DEBATE AROUND- CHARTERS VERSUS TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOLS SO I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT AS A SORT OF A DISCLAIMER FIRST BUT THE FORMULA. AS I READ IT IN I THINK AS IT'S APPLIED UP FOR MUCH OF THE OF THE GRANT PROGRAMS AGAIN THAT HAVE BEEN REFERENCED TODAY OR THAT ARE IN EXISTENCE IN THIS IN THIS SPACE IN THIS AREA. THE ESSENTIALLY- MAKE A CHARTER SCHOOL AND L. E. A. A SINGLE SCHOOL IN L. E. A SEWER DISTRICT LIKE THE OLD ROCK SCHOOL DISTRICT FOR EXAMPLE IN THE SAN JOSE WITH TWELVE THOUSAND. STUDENTS IN- MUCH OF A DISTRICT IN COMMUNITIES OF CONCERN IT HAS THE SAME EVIDENTLY THE SAME. COMPETITIVE OPPORTUNITY IF YOU WILL TO GET A SINGLE GRAD AS A SINGLE SCHOOL WOULD GET- IF- IF THEY'RE IN THE CHARTER SPACE SO I DON'T WANT TO DEBATE THAT TODAY. AND DO THAT I AM JUST WONDERING IF I GUESS WHAT I'M WONDERING IS THERE ARE PEOPLE LOOKING AT THAT- OR THE LOOKING AT THE ACTUAL OUTCOMES THAT WE'RE GETTING WITH THE GRANT DISTRIBUTION FOR FUTURE REFERENCE- SO THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT- YOU KNOW WE ARE GETTING EQUITY ACROSS THE BOARD. THANK YOU MANAGER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR CORTESE ARE WE ARE HERE TO LEARN TODAY AND ALSO TO GET QUESTIONS FROM OUR MEMBERS SO THANK YOU THAT IS HELPFUL. THOROUGH TROUBLED. GOOD MORNING- MADAM CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES I AM- HUGE ADVOCATE OF EARLY EDUCATION AND DIFFERENT MODELS AND SO FORTH. BUT I DID WANT TO COMMENT REALLY QUICK ON SENATOR HANDS- EARLIER REMARKS. I WANT TO INVITE MY COLLEAGUES TO COME AND TO MY DISTRICT AND A VISIT MONTESSORI IN REDLANDS AND IF YOU'RE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE MODEL OF A MONTESSORI EDUCATION IN THE CLASSROOM. I THINK YOU'LL BE FASCINATED TO SEE- THE FACT THAT WE HAVE NAPS PROVIDED THE MONTESSORI CLASSROOM THEY ARE- TOILETS THAT ARE THE SIZE OF YOU KNOW ADEQUATE TO THE CHALLENGE TO THE CHILD. BUT THAT ACTUAL% LEARNING DOES TAKE PLACE UNDERSTANDING THE DEVELOPMENTAL WHAT THEY LEARNED IN SOCIALIZATION BEING A PART OF THAT BUT MY CHILDREN HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO ATTEND AND I'M VERY FAMILIAR WITH IT AND I THINK. SEEING THAT MODEL IN PLACE WOULD ACTUALLY- THE VERY HELPFUL- FOR ALL OF US AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND CONSIDER- PROGRAMS AND RESOURCES TO OUR- EARLY CHILD DEVELOPMENT- AND I WELCOME ALL OF YOU TO COME AND VISIT.
