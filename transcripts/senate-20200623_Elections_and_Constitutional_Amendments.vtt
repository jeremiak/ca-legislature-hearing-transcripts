UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS A

00:32:03.621 --> 00:32:05.423
COMPROMISE WE'RE STILL VERY

00:32:05.490 --> 00:32:07.425
CONCERNED THAT WILL RESULT IN A

00:32:07.492 --> 00:32:10.094
LOT SAID PROPERTY TAX REVENUE

00:32:10.161 --> 00:32:11.829
FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AND I

00:32:11.896 --> 00:32:13.631
THINK THEY APPROACH SAYING

00:32:13.698 --> 00:32:16.534
YOU'RE BEING HOUSING AND CRISIS

00:32:16.601 --> 00:32:19.003
IN CALIFORNIA IS A BIT

00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:21.306
DISINGENUOUS WHERE YOU'RE NOT

00:32:21.372 --> 00:32:23.207
ADDRESSING THE COST OF HOUSING

00:32:23.274 --> 00:32:26.177
YOU'RE TAKING AWAY AND REDUCING

00:32:26.244 --> 00:32:31.983
THE PROPERTY TAX VALUE WE USED.

00:32:32.050 --> 00:32:32.583
TO SUPPORT THOSE COMMUNITIES.

00:32:32.650 --> 00:32:35.119
LIBRARIES PARKS AND SO THE OF

00:32:35.186 --> 00:32:36.854
HOUSING IS STILL OUTRAGEOUS

00:32:36.921 --> 00:32:39.357
YEAH WE'RE REDUCE. THE AMOUNT

00:32:39.424 --> 00:32:41.292
THAT OF FUNDING THAT COMES TO

LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO SUPPORT

00:32:43.628 --> 00:32:48.766
THOSE COMMUNITIES. I THINK ALSO

00:32:48.833 --> 00:32:50.868
YOU KNOW I'M A POLITICAL

00:32:50.935 --> 00:32:51.769
SCIENCE MAJOR NOT A MATH MAJOR

00:32:51.836 --> 00:32:54.105
SO THE FUNDING FORMULA THAT IS

00:32:54.172 --> 00:32:57.108
CREATED AND THEN- AND SEEN-

00:32:57.175 --> 00:32:59.243
CONFUSING I'M NOT REALLY SURE

00:32:59.310 --> 00:33:00.578
THAT IN THAT SHORT AMOUNT OF

00:33:00.645 --> 00:33:02.747
TIME THAT WE UNDERSTAND THAT- I

00:33:02.814 --> 00:33:03.381
THINK WE ARE A LITTLE

00:33:03.448 --> 00:33:06.451
CONCERNED. THAT 75% OF THE

00:33:06.517 --> 00:33:09.053
REVENUE GOES TO FIRES DISTRICT

TRYING TO GET A MEASURE THAT

00:33:22.767 --> 00:33:27.772

00:35:23.521 --> 00:35:26.057
IMPORTANT. WE'VE GOT A

00:35:26.123 --> 00:35:28.292
SIGNIFICANT HOUSING CRISIS

00:35:28.359 --> 00:35:29.627
WHERE WE HAVE FOLKS WHO BOUGHT

00:35:29.694 --> 00:35:31.996
THEIR HOMES PRIOR TO NINETEEN

00:35:32.063 --> 00:35:33.064
SEVENTY EIGHT. AND AS A

00:35:33.130 --> 00:35:35.266
CONSEQUENCE HAVE A VERY LOW TAX

00:35:35.333 --> 00:35:38.002
BASE. MANY OF THOSE HOMEOWNERS

00:35:38.069 --> 00:35:39.170
HAVE PAID OFF THEIR MORTGAGES

00:35:39.237 --> 00:35:41.606
BUT ARE AFRAID TO MOVE BECAUSE

00:35:41.672 --> 00:35:43.341
IF THEY MOVE TO ANOTHER COUNTY

00:35:43.407 --> 00:35:45.543
OR MOVE SOMEPLACE ELSE THAT

00:35:45.610 --> 00:35:47.311
THERE CAN BE IN A SITUATION

00:35:47.378 --> 00:35:48.779
WHERE. RETIRED PRIEST IS THEY

00:35:48.846 --> 00:35:50.014

NINETEEN. SEVENTY FIVE FOR

00:35:53.618 --> 00:35:54.118
EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND

00:35:54.185 --> 00:35:55.419
TODAY IT'S WORTH EIGHT HUNDRED

00:35:55.486 --> 00:35:56.587
THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND EVEN

00:35:56.654 --> 00:35:57.655
THOUGH THEIR CURRENT PROPERTY

00:35:57.722 --> 00:36:00.191
HE HAS IS WORTH MUCH MORE THAN

00:36:00.258 --> 00:36:01.759
WHEN THEY BOUGHT IT. THERE'S A

00:36:01.826 --> 00:36:05.296
DEEP FEAR. THAT THIS ISSUE

00:36:05.363 --> 00:36:07.265
RELATING TO BUYING A NEW HOME

00:36:07.331 --> 00:36:08.699
I'VE TALKED TO MANY SENIORS WHO

00:36:08.766 --> 00:36:10.835
ARE CONCERNED. AND WHAT WE'VE

00:36:10.902 --> 00:36:12.870
DONE IN THIS MEASURE. THE

00:36:12.937 --> 00:36:14.338
AUTHOR I THINK A PRETTY

00:36:14.405 --> 00:36:17.408
ELEGANTLY. IS ALLOW FOR PEOPLE

00:36:17.475 --> 00:36:19.010
AMONG ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES

00:36:19.076 --> 00:36:20.411
TO REALIZE THAT BENEFIT

00:36:20.478 --> 00:36:22.780
SECONDLY. BECAUSE OF THIS

00:36:22.847 --> 00:36:24.115
INTERGENERATIONAL ISSUE THERE'S

00:36:24.181 --> 00:36:25.883
A LOT OF FOLKS WHO ARE OLDER

00:36:25.950 --> 00:36:27.652
FOLKS THAT HAVE AT THE HOMES

00:36:27.718 --> 00:36:30.421
FOR A LONG TIME. AND WE PROVIDE

00:36:30.488 --> 00:36:31.856
OPPORTUNITIES FOR NEW YOUNG

00:36:31.923 --> 00:36:32.924
FAMILIES TO MOVE INTO

00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:34.859
NEIGHBORHOODS. AND SO THE

00:36:34.926 --> 00:36:36.127
ESTIMATE I'VE SEEN AS THIS MAY

00:36:36.193 --> 00:36:38.195
RESULT IN AS MANY AS SEVENTY

00:36:38.262 --> 00:36:40.298
FIVE THOUSAND NEW HOMES. BOTH

00:36:40.364 --> 00:36:41.666

THAT ARE IN THEIR HOMES AND

00:36:46.404 --> 00:36:48.639
WORRIED. DESPERATELY ABOUT

00:36:48.706 --> 00:36:50.575
FACING A LARGER TAX BILL

00:36:50.641 --> 00:36:53.044
