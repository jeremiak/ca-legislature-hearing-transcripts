00:25:24.155 --> 00:25:25.690
BUT FROM THE BEGINNING IT WAS

00:25:25.757 --> 00:25:27.392
MADE CLEAR THAT THERE WERE THOSE

00:25:27.459 --> 00:25:30.028
WHO WOULD EXPLOIT THE GI BILL

00:25:30.095 --> 00:25:32.230

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:43.441
TO BE ENFORCED.

00:25:43.508 --> 00:25:44.709
THIS CONFLICT WAS OCCURRING

00:25:44.776 --> 00:25:46.044
RIGHT AROUND THE SAME TIME THAT

00:25:46.111 --> 00:25:47.646
THE EDUCATION CORPORATION OF

AMERICA SCHOOLS ABRUPTLY SHUT

00:25:49.881 --> 00:25:51.383

00:25:51.449 --> 00:25:53.118
IN CALIFORNIA.

00:25:53.184 --> 00:25:55.654
THAT LEFT APPROXIMATELY FOUR

00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:56.288
HUNDRED VETERAN STUDENTS IN THE

00:25:56.354 --> 00:25:58.023
LURCH.

EVERY MONTH OF THE GI BENEFIT

00:26:00.492 --> 00:26:01.893
FITS AT THAT A VETERAN SINKS

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:03.895
INTO ATTENDING AT DEAD AND

00:26:03.962 --> 00:26:06.464
PROGRAM IS LOST THERE ARE NOW

00:26:06.531 --> 00:26:10.568
WAYS TO THAT VETERANS CONVERT

00:26:10.635 --> 00:26:12.003
COVER THEIR BENEFITS IN SOME

00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:12.437
CASES BUT THEY ARE.

00:26:12.504 --> 00:26:13.471
LIMITED THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT

00:26:13.538 --> 00:26:14.873

SCHOOLS.

00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:24.195
IF THE SCHOOL COST MORE THAN THE

SHARE THOSE COSTS BETWEEN SCHOOL.

00:34:31.269 --> 00:34:33.204

AND MANY OF THESE CHALLENGES ARE

00:34:37.875 --> 00:34:39.744
NOT NEW -- SOME OF THESE TYPES

00:34:39.811 --> 00:34:41.479
OF PROBLEMS OCCURRED WAY BACK

00:34:41.546 --> 00:34:43.314
WITH THE ORIGINAL GI BILL --

THAT BACK IN NINETEEN FORTY FOUR

00:34:45.249 --> 00:34:46.617
AND MANY OF THEM ARE DIRECTLY

00:34:46.684 --> 00:34:47.852
RELATED TO THE FOR PROFIT

00:34:47.919 --> 00:34:51.322
EDUCATION SECTOR AS WAS THE CASE

NINETEEN FORTY FOUR AT THAT TIME.

00:34:53.758 --> 00:34:54.992
THE CREATION THE GI BILL

00:34:55.059 --> 00:34:56.661
DRAMATICALLY EXPANDED THE FOR

PROFIT EDUCATION SECTOR.

00:34:58.529 --> 00:34:59.397
WITHIN THE FIRST FIVE YEARS

00:34:59.464 --> 00:35:00.698
AFTER ITS ENACTMENT.

00:35:00.765 --> 00:35:03.067
THE NUMBER OF FOR PROFIT SCHOOLS

00:35:03.134 --> 00:35:04.001
IN AMERICA TRIPLE AND THAT IS

00:35:04.068 --> 00:35:05.169
WITH THOUSANDS OF FOR PROFIT

00:35:05.236 --> 00:35:06.737
SCHOOLS CLOSING.

00:35:06.804 --> 00:35:08.306
AND THE PROBLEMS WERE WERE OFTEN

00:35:08.372 --> 00:35:08.906
MANY OF THE SAME ONES WE FACE

00:35:08.973 --> 00:35:10.041
HERE TODAY.

00:35:10.107 --> 00:35:11.409
THERE WERE FLY BY NIGHT SCHOOLS

00:35:11.476 --> 00:35:12.543
THEY HAVE PROVIDED SUBSTANDARD

00:35:12.610 --> 00:35:14.178
EDUCATION THEY WERE OVER

00:35:14.245 --> 00:35:15.680
CHARGING VETERANS.

00:35:15.746 --> 00:35:17.915
OFTENTIMES WE JUST SIMPLY

00:35:17.982 --> 00:35:19.584
OUTRIGHT FRAUD.

00:35:19.650 --> 00:35:20.518
CONGRESS REACTED WITH HEARINGS --

00:35:20.585 --> 00:35:21.018
THEY BEGIN IMPOSING NEW

00:35:21.085 --> 00:35:22.687
REQUIREMENTS FOR EXAMPLE THEY

00:35:22.753 --> 00:35:24.188
REQUIRED THAT A SCHOOL COULD

00:35:24.255 --> 00:35:25.590
HAVE NO GREATER THAN A CERTAIN

00:35:25.656 --> 00:35:27.959
PERCENTAGE OF STUDENTS WHO WERE

00:35:28.025 --> 00:35:28.459
VETERANS USING EDUCATION

00:35:28.526 --> 00:35:29.293
BENEFITS.

00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:30.728
WITH THE NIGHT TOWARDS TRYING TO

00:35:30.795 --> 00:35:32.330
ENSURE A CERTAIN INDICIA OF

00:35:32.396 --> 00:35:33.831
CREDIBILITY FOR THOSE

00:35:33.898 --> 00:35:35.233
INSTITUTIONS.

00:35:35.299 --> 00:35:36.367
GRADUALLY BECAME LESS OF A

00:35:36.434 --> 00:35:37.969
PROBLEM OVER TIME IN PART

00:35:38.035 --> 00:35:38.870
BECAUSE OF THE SUCCESSFUL

00:35:38.936 --> 00:35:40.571
REGULATION EFFORTS AND ALSO

00:35:40.638 --> 00:35:41.906
BECAUSE THE BENEFITS BECAME LESS

00:35:41.973 --> 00:35:44.375
GENEROUS QUITE FRANKLY -- AS THE

00:35:44.442 --> 00:35:46.377
BENEFITS BECAME -- LESS

00:35:46.444 --> 00:35:47.979
BENEFICIAL TO THE VETERANS IT

00:35:48.045 --> 00:35:51.315
BECAME LESS OF A A REASON FOR

00:35:51.382 --> 00:35:51.883
THOSE FOR PROFIT SCHOOLS TO

00:35:51.949 --> 00:35:52.917
TARGET THE BETTER.

00:35:52.984 --> 00:35:53.551
TODAY WE SEE THE SAME TYPES OF

00:35:53.618 --> 00:35:54.519
PROBLEMS.

00:35:54.585 --> 00:35:55.887
NOW WHILE EVERY FOR PRIVATE

00:35:55.953 --> 00:35:56.854
SCHOOL IS NOT BAD.

00:35:56.921 --> 00:35:58.923
VIRTUALLY ALL THE PROBLEMS WE

00:35:58.990 --> 00:36:00.992
SEE AT A PLACE LIKE MY CLINIC

00:36:01.058 --> 00:36:01.626
HAPPEN IN THE FOR PROFIT SCHOOL

00:36:01.692 --> 00:36:02.994
SECTOR.

00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:05.029
IN IN IT MATTERS BECAUSE SO MANY

00:36:05.096 --> 00:36:05.830
OF OUR STUDENTS PARENTS ARE

00:36:05.897 --> 00:36:07.498
ATTENDING SCHOOLS AT FOR PROFIT

00:36:07.565 --> 00:36:09.600
SCHOOLS -- MORE THAN 20% OF

00:36:09.667 --> 00:36:10.968
STUDENT VETERANS HAVE ATTENDED A

00:36:11.035 --> 00:36:12.003
FOR PROFIT SCHOOL.

00:36:12.069 --> 00:36:14.338
APPROXIMATELY 9% OF FOR PROFIT

00:36:14.405 --> 00:36:15.706
SCHOOL STUDENTS ARE VETERANS --

00:36:15.773 --> 00:36:17.575
SO I TONE OF MONEY IS GOING

00:36:17.642 --> 00:36:19.911
DIRECTLY TO THE FOR PROFIT

00:36:19.977 --> 00:36:20.845
EDUCATION SECTOR.

00:36:20.912 --> 00:36:22.880
ROUGHLY EIGHT OF THE TOP TEN

00:36:22.947 --> 00:36:24.482
RECIPIENTS OF FOR PROFIT -- CITY

00:36:24.549 --> 00:36:26.584
OF GI BILL BENEFITS ARE FOR

00:36:26.651 --> 00:36:27.585
PROFIT SCHOOLS.

00:36:27.652 --> 00:36:29.353
THE VAST MAJORITY OF INSTANCES

00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:30.655
WE HAVE SEEN IN OUR CLINIC WHICH

00:36:30.721 --> 00:36:32.890
PROVIDES PRO BONO LEGAL SERVICES

00:36:32.957 --> 00:36:34.759
TO OUR VETERANS SERVICE MEMBERS

00:36:34.825 --> 00:36:35.092
THEIR FAMILY.

00:36:35.159 --> 00:36:36.193
HAVE OCCURRED AT THESE FOR

00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:37.929
PROFIT SCHOOLS AS WELL.

00:36:37.995 --> 00:36:39.330
THE TYPES OF ISSUE WE SEE FALL

00:36:39.397 --> 00:36:40.798
BROADLY INTO TWO CATEGORIES.

00:36:40.865 --> 00:36:42.133
THE FIRST HAS TO DO WITH PRE

00:36:42.199 --> 00:36:43.334
ENROLLMENT AND THE SECOND IS

00:36:43.401 --> 00:36:44.802
POST ENROLLMENT IN THE PRE ROMAN

00:36:44.869 --> 00:36:47.238
FACE IT'S PRIMARILY RELATED TO

00:36:47.305 --> 00:36:48.372
PREDATORY RECRUITMENT EFFORTS.

00:36:48.439 --> 00:36:49.206
THAT ONE IS A PRETTY TO

00:36:49.273 --> 00:36:50.641
RECRUITMENT WHAT I MEAN IS WE'VE

00:36:50.708 --> 00:36:53.311
HAD CLIENTS COME TO US AND SAY

00:36:53.377 --> 00:36:54.312
THAT THEY HAVE BEEN LIED TO

00:36:54.378 --> 00:36:55.846
ABOUT ALMOST ANYTHING YOU COULD

00:36:55.913 --> 00:36:57.615
BE LIED TO ABOUT WITH RESPECT TO

00:36:57.682 --> 00:36:59.350
SCHOOLS PROGRAM.

00:36:59.417 --> 00:37:00.017
THAT MEANS VETERANS WHO'VE BEEN

00:37:00.084 --> 00:37:01.919
TOLD -- FALSE JOB PLACEMENT

00:37:01.986 --> 00:37:02.820
RATES.

00:37:02.887 --> 00:37:05.022
FALSE -- SALARY EXPECTATIONS

00:37:05.089 --> 00:37:07.658
AMOUNTS THEY'VE BEEN TOLD THEIR

00:37:07.725 --> 00:37:08.926
SCHOOL IS ACCREDITED ONE IS NOT.

00:37:08.993 --> 00:37:10.828
THEY HAVE BEEN TOLD -- THAT THEY

00:37:10.895 --> 00:37:11.896
COULD COMPLETE THEIR SCHOOL IN A

00:37:11.963 --> 00:37:13.764
CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME WHEN IT

00:37:13.831 --> 00:37:15.600
WAS IMPOSSIBLE WE'VE EVEN HAD

00:37:15.666 --> 00:37:17.034
BETTER INTO BEEN TOLD.

00:37:17.101 --> 00:37:17.702
THAT THE SCHOOL COULD

00:37:17.768 --> 00:37:19.770
ACCOMMODATE THEIR SERIOUS

00:37:19.837 --> 00:37:23.107
SERVICE CONNECTED DISABILITIES

00:37:23.174 --> 00:37:24.976
WHEN THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO DO SO.

00:37:25.042 --> 00:37:25.977
THERE'S ALSO PROBLEMS AFTER ROLE

00:37:26.043 --> 00:37:26.444
THAT.

00:37:26.510 --> 00:37:27.445
WE'VE HAD DEADLINES COME TO US

00:37:27.511 --> 00:37:28.145
WHO SAID THAT THE QUALITY

00:37:28.212 --> 00:37:30.181
EDUCATION IS BEING PROVIDED WAS

00:37:30.247 --> 00:37:32.483
SIGNIFICANTLY LACKING AT THAT.

00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:34.085
INSTRUCTORS THAT WE'RE SUPPOSED

00:37:34.151 --> 00:37:35.620
TO BE TEACHING THEM DID NOT HAVE

00:37:35.686 --> 00:37:37.488
THE REQUISITE CREDENTIALS OR

00:37:37.555 --> 00:37:42.627
KNOWLEDGE IN THE FIELD IN WHICH

00:37:42.693 --> 00:37:44.328
THEY WERE PROVIDING INSTRUCTION.

00:37:44.395 --> 00:37:44.929
AND THAT THE SCHOOLS TO SIMPLY

00:37:44.996 --> 00:37:45.529
DID NOT WOULD NOT MEET THEIR

00:37:45.596 --> 00:37:46.197
EXPECTATIONS OF WHAT THEY NEEDED

00:37:46.263 --> 00:37:48.265
TO BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY

00:37:48.332 --> 00:37:49.367
TRANSITION TO A CIVILIAN CAREER.

00:37:49.433 --> 00:37:50.167
AND WHILE MUCH OF WHAT I

00:37:50.234 --> 00:37:52.103
PROVIDED SO FAR HAS BEEN DATA IN

00:37:52.169 --> 00:37:54.639
IN AND GENERAL CATEGORIES OF

00:37:54.705 --> 00:37:55.706
PROBLEMSI THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

00:37:55.773 --> 00:37:56.807
WE WE DON'T LOSE SIGHT OF THE

00:37:56.874 --> 00:37:58.342
FACT THAT THEIR INDIVIDUAL

00:37:58.409 --> 00:37:58.876
VETERANS WERE REALLY BEING

00:37:58.943 --> 00:38:01.345
HARMED -- ONE OF OUR CLIENTS FOR

00:38:01.412 --> 00:38:02.279
EXAMPLE WAS A MARINE CORPS

00:38:02.346 --> 00:38:04.882
VETERAN WHO WAS SEVERELY INJURED

00:38:04.949 --> 00:38:07.585
AS A RESULT OF AN ENEMY ROCKET

00:38:07.652 --> 00:38:08.219
ATTACK WHILE HE WAS SERVING IN

00:38:08.285 --> 00:38:08.619
IRAQ.

00:38:08.686 --> 00:38:10.287
AMONG HIS MANY INJURIES ONE WAS

00:38:10.354 --> 00:38:12.089
A VERY DEVASTATING AUTOMATIC

00:38:12.156 --> 00:38:13.557
BRAIN INJURY.

00:38:13.624 --> 00:38:15.493
HOWEVER HE STILL WANTED TO AFTER

00:38:15.559 --> 00:38:17.895
LEADING -- SERVICE WITH AN

00:38:17.962 --> 00:38:18.529
HONORABLE DISCHARGE IS HONORABLY

00:38:18.596 --> 00:38:18.963
RETIRED.

00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:21.132
HE WANTED TO PURSUE A HIGHER

00:38:21.198 --> 00:38:23.067
EDUCATION SO THAT HE COULD-- IN

00:38:23.134 --> 00:38:24.969
HIS WORDS CONTINUE TO

00:38:25.036 --> 00:38:26.170
PARTICIPATE IN SOCIETY.

00:38:26.237 --> 00:38:27.905
UNFORTUNATELY HE ENROLLED AT A

00:38:27.972 --> 00:38:29.607
FOR PROFIT SCHOOL -- THE MISLED

00:38:29.674 --> 00:38:31.809
HIM WITH RESPECT TO WHAT TYPES

00:38:31.876 --> 00:38:32.743
OF JOBS HE COULD RECEIVE AT THE

00:38:32.810 --> 00:38:34.178
END -- THEY MISLED HIM WITH

00:38:34.245 --> 00:38:35.179
RESPECT TO HOW LONG SCHOOLS

00:38:35.246 --> 00:38:36.881
PROGRAM WOULD BE AND THEY TOLD

00:38:36.947 --> 00:38:38.649
HIM THAT THE SCHOOL IS

00:38:38.716 --> 00:38:40.051
ACCREDITED WHEN IT WAS NOT.

00:38:40.117 --> 00:38:41.552
ADDING INSULT TO INJURY AFTER HE

00:38:41.619 --> 00:38:42.653
LEFT THE SCHOOL HE CAME TO US

00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:43.788
AND WE DISCOVER THE SCHOOL

00:38:43.854 --> 00:38:45.156
CONTINUE TO RUN HIS GI BILL

00:38:45.222 --> 00:38:47.358
BENEFITS EVEN AFTER HE WAS NO

00:38:47.425 --> 00:38:49.226
LONGER ENROLLED IN THE SCHOOL --

00:38:49.293 --> 00:38:50.461
IT'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE I CAN GIVE

00:38:50.528 --> 00:38:51.862
YOU DOZENS MORE OF INDIVIDUAL

00:38:51.929 --> 00:38:53.764
VETERANS WHO HAVE SERVED THEIR

00:38:53.831 --> 00:38:55.433
COUNTRY HONORABLY.

00:38:55.499 --> 00:38:56.333
RIDE TO DO THE RIGHT THING BY

00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:57.868
PURSUING HIGHER EDUCATION AND

00:38:57.935 --> 00:38:59.704
THEN WE WERE RAN INTO TROUBLE

00:38:59.770 --> 00:39:01.605
WHEN THEY USE THOSE BENEFITS AT

00:39:01.672 --> 00:39:04.041
FOR PROFIT SCHOOLS.

00:39:04.108 --> 00:39:05.476
THE PROBLEM WITH FOR PRIVATE

00:39:05.543 --> 00:39:07.378
SCHOOLS IS NOT ONLY WHAT HAPPENS

00:39:07.445 --> 00:39:08.412
WHILE THE STUDENTS THERE BUT IT

00:39:08.479 --> 00:39:10.481
OFTEN HAPPENS WHEN THE SCHOOL

00:39:10.548 --> 00:39:11.982
ABRUPTLY SHUTS DOWN.

00:39:12.049 --> 00:39:12.950
SO BROUGHT SCHOOL CLOSE TO BEEN

00:39:13.017 --> 00:39:14.151
IN THE NEWS FREQUENTLY WE

00:39:14.218 --> 00:39:15.619
UNFORTUNATELY ARE VERY.

00:39:15.686 --> 00:39:16.954
WELL RECEIVED ARE WELL

00:39:17.021 --> 00:39:18.355
UNDERSTOOD THIS PROBLEM HERE IN

00:39:18.422 --> 00:39:19.623
CALIFORNIA WITH RESPECT TO

00:39:19.690 --> 00:39:20.858
CREATE THE IN BUT THERE'S

00:39:20.925 --> 00:39:22.093
ANOTHER LARGE NATIONAL BRANDS

00:39:22.159 --> 00:39:23.928
THAT HAVE THAT HAVE CLOSED I TT

00:39:23.994 --> 00:39:26.263
EDUCATION CORPORATION OF AMERICA.

00:39:26.330 --> 00:39:27.631
AND ALSO MANY SMALLER SCHOOLS --

00:39:27.698 --> 00:39:29.333
OR REGIONAL SCHOOLS.

00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:31.335
IN RECENT YEARS MORE THAN TWENTY

00:39:31.402 --> 00:39:32.103
TWO THOUSAND VETERANS WERE LEFT

00:39:32.169 --> 00:39:33.604
IN THE LURCH WHEN THEY'RE FOR

00:39:33.671 --> 00:39:34.839
PROFIT SCHOOL CLOSED. ONE OF FOR

00:39:34.905 --> 00:39:36.207
PROFIT SCHOOL CLOTHES IT'S

00:39:36.273 --> 00:39:37.208
PARTICULARLY HARD FOR VETERANS

00:39:37.274 --> 00:39:38.709
BOTH ACADEMICALLY AND NON

00:39:38.776 --> 00:39:40.010
ACADEMICALLY.

00:39:40.077 --> 00:39:41.946
ACADEMICALLY THE CREDIT SIMPLY

00:39:42.012 --> 00:39:43.214
DON'T TRANSFER SO A VETERAN WILL

00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:45.816
SEEK OUT THEIR TRANSCRIPT WHEN

00:39:45.883 --> 00:39:46.617
THE SCHOOL CLOSES NOT ONLY ARE

00:39:46.684 --> 00:39:48.385
THEY SLAP IN THE FACE WHEN THEY

00:39:48.452 --> 00:39:49.887
ATTEMPT TO GO TO SCHOOL ONE DAY

00:39:49.954 --> 00:39:50.955
AND FIND THE DOORS ARE CLOSED

00:39:51.021 --> 00:39:52.289
IT'S SHOCKING IS THAT IS.

00:39:52.356 --> 00:39:56.360
BUT THEN IF THEY CAN EVEN GET

00:39:56.427 --> 00:39:57.762
THEIR TRANSCRIPT THEY DISCOVER

00:39:57.828 --> 00:40:01.499
THAT NO THE GYM AT SCHOOL TAKE

00:40:01.565 --> 00:40:02.933
THEIR CREDITS.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:03.567
FROM A NON ACADEMIC PERSPECTIVE

00:40:03.634 --> 00:40:04.168
VETERANS ARE HIT HARD BECAUSE

00:40:04.235 --> 00:40:05.102
ONE OF THE CRITICAL COMPONENTS

00:40:05.169 --> 00:40:05.736
THE POST NINE ELEVEN GI BILL IS

00:40:05.803 --> 00:40:06.303
A HOUSING ALLOWANCE IN THE

00:40:06.370 --> 00:40:06.771
HOUSING LOANS IS VERY

00:40:06.837 --> 00:40:07.638
SIGNIFICANT.

00:40:07.705 --> 00:40:09.240
AND IT'S PARTICULAR LIES TO THE

00:40:09.306 --> 00:40:10.775
LOCATION WHERE THE STUDENTS

00:40:10.841 --> 00:40:11.742
ATTENDING SCHOOL.

00:40:11.809 --> 00:40:13.677
SO IN THE CONTEXT OF STUDENTS

00:40:13.744 --> 00:40:14.178
ATTENDING SCHOOL IN SAN

00:40:14.245 --> 00:40:16.147
FRANCISCO THEY MIGHT RECEIVE

00:40:16.213 --> 00:40:17.848
MANY MORE THOUSAND DOLLARS THAN

00:40:17.915 --> 00:40:18.916
A STUDENT WHO IS ATTENDING

00:40:18.983 --> 00:40:20.217
SCHOOL FOR EXAMPLE RIVERSIDE.

00:40:20.284 --> 00:40:21.519
AT THE IDEAS TO TRY TO MEET UP

00:40:21.585 --> 00:40:22.620
WITH THE COST OF LIVING SO THAT

00:40:22.686 --> 00:40:23.554
THE STUDENT VETERANS.

00:40:23.621 --> 00:40:25.422
CAN FOCUS ON THEIR EDUCATION AND

00:40:25.489 --> 00:40:27.258
NOT WORRY ABOUT PAYING THEIR

00:40:27.324 --> 00:40:28.559
BILLS AS ATTENDING SCHOOL.

00:40:28.626 --> 00:40:29.660
SO WHEN IS DOING BETTER IN

00:40:29.727 --> 00:40:31.328
SCHOOL CLOSES NOT ONLY DID THEY

00:40:31.395 --> 00:40:32.696
LOSE THEIR OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE

00:40:32.763 --> 00:40:34.064
EDUCATION AT THAT SCHOOL.

00:40:34.131 --> 00:40:35.366
BUT THEY ALSO OFTENTIMES LOSE

00:40:35.432 --> 00:40:36.700
THEIR HOUSING BENEFIT AND THEN

00:40:36.767 --> 00:40:38.369
IN BECAUSE OF THAT THERE WERE

00:40:38.435 --> 00:40:39.470
NOT JUST ABOUT WHERE THERE'S

00:40:39.537 --> 00:40:40.838
LIKE SCHOOLS GOING TO BE BUT HOW

00:40:40.905 --> 00:40:41.872
THEY'RE GONNA CONTINUE THEIR

00:40:41.939 --> 00:40:42.773
PURSUIT OF A CAREER

00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:43.974
OPPORTUNITIES.

00:40:44.041 --> 00:40:45.442
BUT ALSO HOW THEY CAN KEEP HOME.

00:40:45.509 --> 00:40:46.811
HOW DO YOU KEEP A ROOF OVER THE

00:40:46.877 --> 00:40:48.045
HEADS OF THEMSELVES IN THEIR IN

00:40:48.112 --> 00:40:49.580
THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS?

00:40:49.647 --> 00:40:50.281
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO MAKE A

00:40:50.347 --> 00:40:52.116
STUDENT HOLE IN ANY CONTEXT WHEN

00:40:52.183 --> 00:40:53.184
THEY HAVE BEEN HARMED BY A FOR

00:40:53.250 --> 00:40:55.753
PROFIT SCHOOL IT'S PARTICULARLY

00:40:55.820 --> 00:40:57.121
SO IN AN ABRUPT SCHOOL CLOSURE.

00:40:57.188 --> 00:40:58.556
THERE'S NO ONE LEFT TO SEE

00:40:58.622 --> 00:41:00.257
THERE'S NO ONE WHO IF A STUDENT

00:41:00.324 --> 00:41:01.792
AND WERE TO COME TO A PRO BONO

00:41:01.859 --> 00:41:02.560
CLINIC LIKE MINE.

00:41:02.626 --> 00:41:05.429
WELL WE CAN GO TO TRY.

00:41:05.496 --> 00:41:06.864
TO RETURN THOSE BENEFITS TO THAT

00:41:06.931 --> 00:41:08.065
AND EVEN IF WE WERE ABLE TO DO

00:41:08.132 --> 00:41:09.600
SO I CAN'T GIVE THEM BACK THEIR

00:41:09.667 --> 00:41:10.935
TIME YOU KNOW THESE ARE VETERANS

00:41:11.001 --> 00:41:13.504
WHO HAVE ALREADY SPENT YEARS OF

00:41:13.571 --> 00:41:14.138
THEIR LIVES IN SERVICE TO THEIR

00:41:14.205 --> 00:41:14.905
COUNTRY.

00:41:14.972 --> 00:41:16.240
THEY ARE READY TO MOVE ON AT

00:41:16.307 --> 00:41:18.409
THIS POINT AND CAN PURSUE THE

00:41:18.475 --> 00:41:20.945
REST OF THEIR LIFE AND SO AT

00:41:21.011 --> 00:41:21.645
THAT POINT WHEN THE SCHOOL

00:41:21.712 --> 00:41:23.347
CLOSES IN THE CREDITS CAN'T

00:41:23.414 --> 00:41:24.481
TRANSFER ANYWHERE AND THEY'VE

00:41:24.548 --> 00:41:25.816
WASTED THEIR BENEFITS.

00:41:25.883 --> 00:41:27.384
IT PUTS IN AN OFTENTIMES INTO A

00:41:27.451 --> 00:41:28.652
DOWNWARD SPIRAL WHERE THEY'RE

00:41:28.719 --> 00:41:29.687
SIMPLY NOT ANOTHER GOOD

00:41:29.753 --> 00:41:33.891
OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM AND THEY

00:41:33.958 --> 00:41:34.525
END UP TAKING WHATEVER JOB THEY

00:41:34.592 --> 00:41:34.792
CAN GET.

00:41:34.859 --> 00:41:35.426
WE'VE HAD CLIENTS WHO ENDED UP

00:41:35.492 --> 00:41:36.026
GOING BACK TO THE SAME RETAIL

00:41:36.093 --> 00:41:37.761
JOB THAT THEY HAD BEFORE THEY

00:41:37.828 --> 00:41:39.897
HAD INVESTED LITERALLY SEVENTY

00:41:39.964 --> 00:41:41.999
FIVE OR A HUNDRED THOUSAND

00:41:42.066 --> 00:41:43.934
DOLLARS IN SCHOOL THAT CLOSED.

00:41:44.001 --> 00:41:45.803
OBVIOUSLY THERE FOR THE ISSUE

00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:47.104
SHOULD BE IF THERE'S FOCUSING TO

00:41:47.171 --> 00:41:48.772
BE AND WHAT TO DO AFTER THE

00:41:48.839 --> 00:41:50.307
VETERANS BEEN HARM SO MUCH IS

00:41:50.374 --> 00:41:51.575
HOW DO WE STOP THESE PROBLEMS

00:41:51.642 --> 00:41:52.509
FROM HAPPENING IN THE FIRST

00:41:52.576 --> 00:41:52.877
PLACE.

00:41:52.943 --> 00:41:54.345
AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE I WILL

00:41:54.411 --> 00:41:56.080
BE HOPEFULLY INTO THE THE SUBS

00:41:56.146 --> 00:41:56.914

00:42:39.456 --> 00:42:40.624
AFTER PROGRAMS WERE APPROVED.

00:42:40.691 --> 00:42:42.293
CALIFORNIA HOWEVER I'M GLAD

00:42:42.359 --> 00:42:43.694
REPORT HAS A REPUTATION FOR

00:42:43.761 --> 00:42:45.162
VIGOROUSLY DEFENDING THE RIGHTS

00:42:45.229 --> 00:42:46.730
OF OUR STUDENTS.

00:42:46.797 --> 00:42:47.264
THEY ARE SEEN WITHIN THE

00:42:47.331 --> 00:42:48.532
COMMUNITY WITHIN THE VETERANS

00:42:48.599 --> 00:42:50.868
COMMUNITY AS BEING A CHAMPION OF

00:42:50.935 --> 00:42:52.770
PROTECTING STUDENT VETERANS AND

00:42:52.836 --> 00:42:54.204
UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE OF THIS

00:42:54.271 --> 00:42:55.406
REPUTATION THEY HAVE DRAWN THE

00:42:55.472 --> 00:42:57.608
IRE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:42:57.675 --> 00:42:58.342
VETERANS AFFAIRS.

00:42:58.409 --> 00:42:59.810
IT IS CREATED ALL KINDS OF

00:42:59.877 --> 00:43:00.945
ISSUES THAT I'M SURE WILL BE

00:43:01.011 --> 00:43:02.479
EXPLORED IN SUBSEQUENT PANELS --

00:43:02.546 --> 00:43:05.215
WHERE WHERE THE CONCERN BECOMES

00:43:05.282 --> 00:43:07.217
TO WHAT EXTENT CAN SEE SAVE STEP

00:43:07.284 --> 00:43:08.752
IN TO ENSURE THAT STUDENT

00:43:08.819 --> 00:43:09.820
VETERANS HERE IN CALIFORNIA

00:43:09.887 --> 00:43:11.855
PROTECTED AND TO WHAT EXTENT THE

00:43:11.922 --> 00:43:13.057
DEPARTMENT AT ARMS FAIRS WILL

00:43:13.123 --> 00:43:13.757
ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN?

00:43:13.824 --> 00:43:15.459
I BELIEVE THAT THERE IS

00:43:15.526 --> 00:43:17.394
REASONABLE OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUR

00:43:17.461 --> 00:43:19.863
STATE LEGISLATURE TO INSURE THAT

00:43:19.930 --> 00:43:22.433
SEE SAFE IS ABLE TO HAVE THE

00:43:22.499 --> 00:43:24.301
AUTHORITY THEY NEED. TO DO TO

00:43:24.368 --> 00:43:26.303
STEP UP AND PROTECT THE RIGHTS

00:43:26.370 --> 00:43:28.072
OF THOSE WHO HAVE STEPPED UP TO

00:43:28.138 --> 00:43:30.040
PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF THEIR

00:43:30.107 --> 00:43:31.508
FELLOW CITIZENS.

00:43:31.575 --> 00:43:34.578
FINALLY IN CONCLUSION -- I THINK

00:43:34.645 --> 00:43:35.980
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AND THAT

00:43:36.046 --> 00:43:37.281
THEY WERE HAVING THIS HEARING

00:43:37.348 --> 00:43:39.183
TODAY I APPRECIATE YOUR INTEREST

00:43:39.249 --> 00:43:40.584
IN THIS TOPIC.

00:43:40.651 --> 00:43:42.086
I CAN'T EXPRESS TO YOU ENOUGH

00:43:42.152 --> 00:43:44.722
HOW HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO SIT

00:43:44.788 --> 00:43:45.322
WITH THE STUDENT VETERANS WHO

00:43:45.389 --> 00:43:47.191
HAS DONE EVERYTHING WE WOULD

00:43:47.257 --> 00:43:49.593
WANT THEM TO DO -- SERVE THEIR

00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:51.095
COUNTRY HONORABLY ARE ATTEMPTING

00:43:51.161 --> 00:43:52.396
TO MAKE A SUCCESSFUL TRANSITION

00:43:52.463 --> 00:43:54.031
TO CIVILIAN LIFE ONLY TO FIND

00:43:54.098 --> 00:43:56.233
OUT -- THAT THEY WERE DEFRAUDED

00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:57.968
BY SCHOOL THAT TOOK ADVANTAGE OF

00:43:58.035 --> 00:43:58.602
THEM.

00:43:58.669 --> 00:44:00.337
SAW AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A

00:44:00.404 --> 00:44:01.472
QUICK BUCK OFF THE BACKS OF

00:44:01.538 --> 00:44:02.806
VETERANS AT THE EXPENSE OF THE

00:44:02.873 --> 00:44:04.141
AMERICAN TAXPAYER.

00:44:04.208 --> 00:44:05.209
I THANK YOU FOR YOUR FOR YOUR

00:44:05.275 --> 00:44:06.410
TIME YOUR TENSION AND IF THERE'S

00:44:06.477 --> 00:44:08.379
ANY QUESTIONS I CAN ANSWER I'D

00:44:08.445 --> 00:44:11.482
BE HAPPY TO SEND.

00:44:11.548 --> 00:44:13.350
I'D LIKE TO ASK A QUESTION WE WE

00:44:13.417 --> 00:44:15.986
HEARD FROM VETERANS DIRECTLY --

00:44:16.053 --> 00:44:16.487
I THINK IT BUSINESS AND

00:44:16.553 --> 00:44:17.721
PROFESSIONS.

00:44:17.788 --> 00:44:19.690
A COUPLE WEEKS AGO AND WE HEARD.

00:44:19.757 --> 00:44:22.559
PRETTY HORRENDOUS STORIES ABOUT

00:44:22.626 --> 00:44:25.095
HOW VETERANS HAD BEEN -- IN MY

00:44:25.162 --> 00:44:29.366
ESTIMATE ALMOST -- DEFRAUDED --

00:44:29.433 --> 00:44:31.335
IN.

00:44:31.402 --> 00:44:36.006
BY SOME OF THESE -- BAD ACTORS --

00:44:36.073 --> 00:44:37.708
WHAT MORE AND HOW?

00:44:37.775 --> 00:44:39.743
CAN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHAT

00:44:39.810 --> 00:44:44.048
CAN WE DO -- TOOK. TO GUIDE --

00:44:44.114 --> 00:44:46.517
VETERANS TO TO THE MOST

00:44:46.583 --> 00:44:49.953
APPROPRIATE. FOR THE BEST

00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:51.922
DECISIONS THAT THEY CAN MAKE.

00:44:51.989 --> 00:44:53.924
AND GUIDE THEM AWAY FROM SOME OF

00:44:53.991 --> 00:44:55.592
THE THE BAD ACTORS.

00:44:55.659 --> 00:44:56.760
THANK YOU VERY MUCH GERMANY YEAH

00:44:56.827 --> 00:44:57.828
THAT'S A WONDERFUL QUESTION I

00:44:57.895 --> 00:45:00.264
THINK THE I THINK ONE THING THAT

00:45:00.330 --> 00:45:02.199
THAT IS A VERY CONCRETE WAY THE

00:45:02.266 --> 00:45:03.834
STATE LEGISLATURE COULD DO IS

00:45:03.901 --> 00:45:05.102
THERE IS A PACKAGE OF SEVEN

00:45:05.169 --> 00:45:06.537
BILLS PENDING.

00:45:06.603 --> 00:45:08.572
BEFORE THE ASSEMBLY THAT DIRECT

00:45:08.639 --> 00:45:11.442
WE SEEK TO CLOSE A VARIETY OF

00:45:11.508 --> 00:45:12.776
LOOPHOLES THAT HAVE BEEN CAUSING

00:45:12.843 --> 00:45:15.179
TROUBLE -- FOR STUDENTS --

00:45:15.245 --> 00:45:16.447
RELATED TO GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT

00:45:16.513 --> 00:45:19.283
RELATED TO ANTI KICKBACK

00:45:19.349 --> 00:45:21.218
PROVISIONS -- A NUMBER OF OTHER

00:45:21.285 --> 00:45:22.286
KIND A HOST OF OTHER DIFFERENT

00:45:22.352 --> 00:45:23.287
ISSUES.

00:45:23.353 --> 00:45:24.388
AND I THINK THOSE ARE IMPORTANT

00:45:24.455 --> 00:45:26.924
I THINK THOSE ARE WAYS IN WHICH

00:45:26.990 --> 00:45:28.759
THE STATE CAN STEP IN UNDER THE

00:45:28.826 --> 00:45:30.427
PRINCIPLES OF FEDERALISM AND

00:45:30.494 --> 00:45:31.862
ENSURE THAT IF THE DEPARTMENT

00:45:31.929 --> 00:45:33.697
VETERANS AFFAIRS IS NOT GOING TO

00:45:33.764 --> 00:45:35.599
DO ITS ROLE IN PROTECTING

00:45:35.666 --> 00:45:36.633
STUDENT VETERANS.

00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:38.035
THAT CALIFORNIA'S STATE

00:45:38.102 --> 00:45:39.470
APPROVING AGENCY HAS THE

00:45:39.536 --> 00:45:41.572
AUTHORITY TO DO SO -- I THINK

00:45:41.638 --> 00:45:42.739
THAT OUR STATE APPROVING AGENCY

00:45:42.806 --> 00:45:46.310
IS IS WILLING AND ABLE TO

00:45:46.376 --> 00:45:47.478
PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF STUDENT AT

00:45:47.544 --> 00:45:48.378
ARMS THEY'RE I THINK THEY'RE

00:45:48.445 --> 00:45:49.480
UNDER QUITE FRANKLY I THINK THE

00:45:49.546 --> 00:45:50.814
UNDER RESOURCE I THINK THEY

00:45:50.881 --> 00:45:53.083
COULD DO I THINK THEY DO A LOT --

00:45:53.150 --> 00:45:54.351
FOR THE BUDGET THAT THEY HAVE

00:45:54.418 --> 00:45:55.652
AND THEIR FUNDING GENERALLY

00:45:55.719 --> 00:45:57.654
COMES FROM A CONTRACT WITH THE

00:45:57.721 --> 00:45:59.056
DEPARTMENT AT ARMS AFFAIRS BUT

00:45:59.123 --> 00:46:00.491
IF THEY HAD MORE RESOURCES I

00:46:00.557 --> 00:46:02.092
BELIEVE PERSONALLY THAT THEY

00:46:02.159 --> 00:46:03.393
WOULD BE ABLE TO DO MORE ON THE

00:46:03.460 --> 00:46:04.595
AFGHAN VETERANS BY DO THINK --

00:46:04.661 --> 00:46:06.530
RIGHT NOW IT'S WE GET QUITE A

00:46:06.597 --> 00:46:07.698
BANG FOR THE BUCK FOR WHAT THEY

00:46:07.764 --> 00:46:08.999
DO HAVE SO I THINK THOSE ARE TWO

00:46:09.066 --> 00:46:10.367
CONCRETE WAYS WOULD BE EXPAND

00:46:10.434 --> 00:46:11.201
RESOURCE FOR C. SAVE.

00:46:11.268 --> 00:46:13.370
AND THEN ALSO -- ENSURING THAT

00:46:13.437 --> 00:46:16.840
THOSE BILLS PASSED LEGISLATURE.

00:46:16.907 --> 00:46:21.078
THANK YOU.

00:46:21.145 --> 00:46:22.713
I HAVE A COUPLE OF TWENTY TWO

00:46:22.779 --> 00:46:25.015
CAN YOU HEAR ME [inaudible]

00:46:25.082 --> 00:46:27.084
OKAY OF SO WE'VE HAD A LONG

00:46:27.151 --> 00:46:28.819
HISTORY WITH THE GI BILL AND

00:46:28.886 --> 00:46:31.054
YOU'RE SORT OF DESCRIBING UPS

00:46:31.121 --> 00:46:32.789
AND DOWNS WHAT ARE THE OVER THE

00:46:32.856 --> 00:46:35.692
HISTORY OF THE BILL WHAT ARE THE

00:46:35.759 --> 00:46:36.894
REGULATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN.

00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:39.163
EVEN TO BE MOST EFFECTIVE THAT --

00:46:39.229 --> 00:46:42.232
STOPPING THE EXPLOITATION OF

00:46:42.299 --> 00:46:45.669
VETERANS.

00:46:45.736 --> 00:46:48.205
THE ONE THING I SEE LOOKS OR I

00:46:48.272 --> 00:46:48.839
THINK MADE QUITE A DIFFERENCE

00:46:48.906 --> 00:46:50.107
WAS EVEN IN BACK TO THE ORIGINAL

00:46:50.174 --> 00:46:51.275
GI BILL.

00:46:51.341 --> 00:46:53.277
THE THE CONGRESS IMPOSE

00:46:53.343 --> 00:46:55.612
REQUIREMENTS THAT NO MORE THAN A

00:46:55.679 --> 00:46:57.347
CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF THE

00:46:57.414 --> 00:46:58.682
STUDENT POPULATION AT A GIVEN

00:46:58.749 --> 00:47:01.251
SCHOOL BE STUDENT VETERANS -- SO

00:47:01.318 --> 00:47:02.786
SIMILAR I THINK THOSE TYPES OF

00:47:02.853 --> 00:47:04.755
REGULATIONS WORK BECAUSE IT

00:47:04.821 --> 00:47:06.490
REQUIRES THE SCHOOL TO ENSURE

00:47:06.557 --> 00:47:09.826
THAT IT'S ATTRACTING A DIVERSE

00:47:09.893 --> 00:47:11.094
GROUP OF STUDENTS TO THE

00:47:11.161 --> 00:47:12.029
INSTITUTION.

00:47:12.095 --> 00:47:13.163
AND THAT SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO

00:47:13.230 --> 00:47:14.665
ARE ATTENDING ARE ARE PAYING OUT

00:47:14.731 --> 00:47:16.200
OF POCKET SO FOR EXAMPLE --

00:47:16.266 --> 00:47:18.001
REQUIREMENTS THAT NO MORE THAN A

00:47:18.068 --> 00:47:18.802
CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF STUDENTS

00:47:18.869 --> 00:47:21.038
BE VETERANS OR THAT NO MORE THAN

00:47:21.104 --> 00:47:23.540
A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF THE

00:47:23.607 --> 00:47:24.975
INSTITUTIONS REVENUE BEAST

00:47:25.042 --> 00:47:26.510
DIRECTLY FROM THE FEDERAL

00:47:26.577 --> 00:47:27.978
GOVERNMENT SO FOR EXAMPLE.

00:47:28.045 --> 00:47:29.546
RIGHT NOW IS A FOR PROFIT SCHOOL

00:47:29.613 --> 00:47:31.215
COULD NOT DRIVE MORE THAN 90% OF

00:47:31.281 --> 00:47:33.383
ITS REVENUE FROM THE FEDERAL

00:47:33.450 --> 00:47:34.318
GOVERNMENT THEORETICALLY IT

00:47:34.384 --> 00:47:35.686
REALLY THAT'S TITLE FOR MONEY.

00:47:35.752 --> 00:47:36.920
AND THERE'S A HUGE LOOPHOLE AND

00:47:36.987 --> 00:47:38.422
THAT AND THAT LOOPHOLE IS THE GI

00:47:38.488 --> 00:47:41.258
BILL IT DOESN'T COUNT ON THE 90%

00:47:41.325 --> 00:47:42.726
FEDERAL MONEY SIDE OF LEDGER

00:47:42.793 --> 00:47:43.994
ACCOUNTS AS IF SOMEBODY'S PAYING

00:47:44.061 --> 00:47:45.028
OUT OF POCKET.

00:47:45.095 --> 00:47:46.597
AND THE PROBLEM WITH THAT

00:47:46.663 --> 00:47:49.566
SPECIFIC REGULATION LEUPOLD HIS

00:47:49.633 --> 00:47:51.034
THAT.

00:47:51.101 --> 00:47:52.469
IT THEN PUT A HUGE TARGET ON THE

00:47:52.536 --> 00:47:53.570
BACKS OF VETERANS IT MAKES IT SO

00:47:53.637 --> 00:47:54.838
THAT BETTER INS BECOME --

00:47:54.905 --> 00:47:56.173
SOMEONE THAT IF A RECRUITER CAN

00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:57.140
BRING IN ONE VETERAN THEY COULD

00:47:57.207 --> 00:47:59.409
THEN BRING AND NINE OTHER NON

00:47:59.476 --> 00:48:01.144
VETERANS IF THEY WERE CAP UNDER

00:48:01.211 --> 00:48:02.379
THE NINETY TEN RULE.

00:48:02.446 --> 00:48:03.180
AND ONE OF THE PIECE OF

00:48:03.247 --> 00:48:04.982
LEGISLATION THAT THAT IS UP FOR

00:48:05.048 --> 00:48:06.350
CONSIDERATION NOW IS A

00:48:06.416 --> 00:48:08.285
CALIFORNIA SPECIFIC WAY TO CLOSE

00:48:08.352 --> 00:48:10.587
THAT NINETY TEMPLE SO I THINK

00:48:10.654 --> 00:48:11.154
THOSE TYPES REGULATIONS ARE

00:48:11.221 --> 00:48:11.788
IMPORTANT [inaudible]

00:48:11.855 --> 00:48:13.824
AND ALSO.

00:48:13.890 --> 00:48:15.726
YOU HEAD OF MENTIONED EARLIER

00:48:15.792 --> 00:48:18.428
THAT WHEN THE BENEFITS FROM THE

00:48:18.495 --> 00:48:20.664
MOST GENEROUS IS WHEN YOU HAVE

00:48:20.731 --> 00:48:22.432
THE MOST EXPLOITATION.

00:48:22.499 --> 00:48:25.535
AND WHEN THEY CHECK -- BENEFITS

00:48:25.602 --> 00:48:27.437
WERE LESS GENEROUS YOU SAW THAT

00:48:27.504 --> 00:48:28.338
DECREASE WHAT.

00:48:28.405 --> 00:48:29.906
WHAT TYPE OF PERIOD ARE WE IN

00:48:29.973 --> 00:48:32.042
RIGHT NOW?

00:48:32.109 --> 00:48:32.676
THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION I THINK

00:48:32.743 --> 00:48:33.310
RIGHT NOW WE'RE IN A GENEROUS

00:48:33.377 --> 00:48:34.544
CARE AND I THINK THAT'S GREAT I

00:48:34.611 --> 00:48:35.345
THINK I THINK THE PROBLEM IS

00:48:35.412 --> 00:48:37.881
THAT -- WITH THIS GREAT BENEFIT

00:48:37.948 --> 00:48:39.149
YOU HAVE INDIVIDUALS BY

00:48:39.216 --> 00:48:41.218
UNSCRUPULOUS ACTORS WHO SEE THAT

00:48:41.285 --> 00:48:43.420
AS A TARGET AWAY TO DERIVE

00:48:43.487 --> 00:48:45.389
INCOME QUITE FRANKLY.

00:48:45.455 --> 00:48:46.623
SO I THINK WE'RE IN A I THINK

00:48:46.690 --> 00:48:47.924
ANY VETERANS ARE VERY HAPPY WITH

00:48:47.991 --> 00:48:48.759
POSTED ELEVEN YEAH I DO I THINK

00:48:48.825 --> 00:48:49.259
THEY THEY ARE THEY ARE

00:48:49.326 --> 00:48:51.762
APPRECIATIVE OF THE SUPPORT OF

00:48:51.828 --> 00:48:53.530
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND ENSURING

00:48:53.597 --> 00:48:54.131
THAT THEY MAKE THAT SUCCESSFUL

00:48:54.197 --> 00:48:56.066
TRANSITION -- AND I THINK IT'S

00:48:56.133 --> 00:48:58.802
NECESSARY -- BUT BUT I THINK AT

00:48:58.869 --> 00:48:59.636
THE SAME TIME WE MAKE SURE WE

00:48:59.703 --> 00:49:01.571
HOLD THE BAD ACTORS TO ACCOUNT

00:49:01.638 --> 00:49:02.739
SO THAT THOSE BETTER IS ABLE TO

00:49:02.806 --> 00:49:04.241
USE THOSE BENEFITS THE WAY THEY

00:49:04.308 --> 00:49:05.008
WERE INTENDED.

00:49:05.075 --> 00:49:08.545
RIGHT THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER

00:49:08.612 --> 00:49:09.813
FRAZIER.

00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:10.747
THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR

00:49:10.814 --> 00:49:12.249

00:49:12.316 --> 00:49:13.717
YOUR SERVICE.

00:49:13.784 --> 00:49:14.851
SECONDS -- THIS LEGISLATIVE

00:49:14.918 --> 00:49:16.186
SESSION THIRTEEN FOURTEEN I

00:49:16.253 --> 00:49:18.188
INTRODUCED A BILL TO ADDRESS

00:49:18.255 --> 00:49:23.160
THIS EXACT ISSUE -- AB.

00:49:23.226 --> 00:49:23.727
TWENTY NINETY NINE AND WE'RE

00:49:23.794 --> 00:49:25.762
SUPPOSED TO PROTECT THE VETERANS

00:49:25.829 --> 00:49:27.998
FROM PREDATORY PRACTICES -- AND

00:49:28.065 --> 00:49:29.833
ALSO MAKE ACCOUNTABLE THE COOLER

00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:31.735
DEFAULT RATE -- AT A CERTAIN

00:49:31.802 --> 00:49:33.236
PERCENTAGE AS THEY WOULDN'T

00:49:33.303 --> 00:49:37.974
QUALIFY. FOR FOR THE THE GI BILL

00:49:38.041 --> 00:49:39.142
OR ARTICLE THIRTY ONE MONIES.

00:49:39.209 --> 00:49:41.578
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THAT.

00:49:41.645 --> 00:49:42.179
WELL I THINK IT'S VERY POOR

00:49:42.245 --> 00:49:43.580
THESE LEGISLATION -- ACTUALLY

00:49:43.647 --> 00:49:45.048
CAME UP HERE AND INTESTINE FAVOR

00:49:45.115 --> 00:49:46.550
OF EDITION TIME SO THAT'S RIGHT

00:49:46.616 --> 00:49:48.585
SIR -- I THINK IT'S A MORE IT

00:49:48.652 --> 00:49:50.887
SEEMS LIKE WE'RE IN A PERPETUAL --

00:49:50.954 --> 00:49:54.191
FORGET ME NOT FORGET ME YOU KNOW

00:49:54.257 --> 00:49:55.659
KIND OF A WHEEL AND AND I'M NOT.

00:49:55.726 --> 00:49:56.293
ARE WE DOING THINGS ARE JUST ARE

00:49:56.360 --> 00:49:57.928
NOT BEING.

00:49:57.994 --> 00:50:00.497
ADDRESSED IN AND IT ADOPTED OR

00:50:00.564 --> 00:50:01.998
ARE WE GOING TO GO TO A FOUR

00:50:02.065 --> 00:50:03.166
YEAR CYCLE AND SAY.

00:50:03.233 --> 00:50:05.569
THAT -- YEAH IT'S NOT WORKING

00:50:05.635 --> 00:50:05.769
STILL.

00:50:05.836 --> 00:50:08.405
I MEAN.

00:50:08.472 --> 00:50:09.039
WHAT WILL YOU KNOW LEGISLATURE'S

00:50:09.106 --> 00:50:11.675
TRYING TO IT TO JUSTIN AND AND?

00:50:11.742 --> 00:50:13.210
DO THE STUFF AND WHERE ARE

00:50:13.276 --> 00:50:14.978
WHERE'S THE WHERE'S THE MISSING.

00:50:15.045 --> 00:50:16.079
COMPONENT WHEN WE'RE DOING THIS

00:50:16.146 --> 00:50:18.181
LEGISLATION IS SUPPOSED TO

00:50:18.248 --> 00:50:19.783
ADDRESS THIS STUFF.

00:50:19.850 --> 00:50:20.751
IT'S A GREAT QUESTION I THINK.

00:50:20.817 --> 00:50:23.987
I THINK THE PREVIOUS LEGISLATION

00:50:24.054 --> 00:50:24.554
DID MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND I

00:50:24.621 --> 00:50:25.222
THINK TO SOME OF WHAT I THINK IS

00:50:25.288 --> 00:50:26.656
GOING ON HERE IS YOU HAVE --

00:50:26.723 --> 00:50:28.191
CERTAIN ACTORS WITHIN THE FOR

00:50:28.258 --> 00:50:30.093
PROFIT SECTOR WHO SPEND AN

00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:31.595
ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY.

00:50:31.661 --> 00:50:34.097
ON LAWYERS -- WHO ARE ABLE TO

00:50:34.164 --> 00:50:36.066
FIND WAYS AROUND THESE

00:50:36.133 --> 00:50:36.900
REGULATIONS SO WHEN YOU LOOK

00:50:36.967 --> 00:50:38.635
HISTORICALLY WHAT YOU SEE IS?

00:50:38.702 --> 00:50:40.504
IT BECOMES ALMOST CYCLICAL GOING

00:50:40.570 --> 00:50:41.638
WAY BACK TO THE ORIGINAL GI BILL

00:50:41.705 --> 00:50:43.540
WHERE IT DAY THERE WERE ABUSES

00:50:43.607 --> 00:50:45.609
AND AND CONGRESS IN THAT CONTEXT

00:50:45.675 --> 00:50:47.544
STEPPED IN. TO SOLVE SOME OF

00:50:47.611 --> 00:50:48.979
THOSE AND THEN THINGS SETTLE

00:50:49.045 --> 00:50:49.813
DOWN A LITTLE BIT AND THEN THEY

00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:51.481
POP BACK UP IN SO I THINK THAT'S

00:50:51.548 --> 00:50:52.983
PART OF WHAT'S GOING ON HERE IS

00:50:53.049 --> 00:50:54.351
YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE FINDING

00:50:54.418 --> 00:50:55.485
DEVIOUS WAYS AROUND IT.

00:50:55.552 --> 00:50:56.286
ALTHOUGH I DO THINK IT'S MAKING

00:50:56.353 --> 00:50:57.988
A DIFFERENCE -- THE THE OVERALL

00:50:58.054 --> 00:50:59.423
PERCENTAGE OF STUDENTS ENROLLING

00:50:59.489 --> 00:51:01.158
IN SOME OF THE WORST SCHOOLS --

00:51:01.224 --> 00:51:02.726
HAS DECREASED SOME OF THESE

00:51:02.793 --> 00:51:03.260
SCHOOLS HAVE GONE OUT OF

00:51:03.326 --> 00:51:04.461
BUSINESS WHICH WHILE CERTAINLY

00:51:04.528 --> 00:51:06.596
DEVASTATING INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE

00:51:06.663 --> 00:51:07.497
THERE AT THAT TIME -- IN THE

00:51:07.564 --> 00:51:08.498
LONG RUN I THINK IT'S GOOD YOU

00:51:08.565 --> 00:51:09.266
KNOW WE DON'T HAVE STUDENTS

00:51:09.332 --> 00:51:10.500
GOING TO SOME OF THE WORST

00:51:10.567 --> 00:51:12.702
ACTORS FOR EXAMPLE CORINTHIAN OR

00:51:12.769 --> 00:51:14.638
I TT OR EDUCATION CORPORATION OF

00:51:14.704 --> 00:51:15.505
AMERICA SO I DO THINK IT MAKES A

00:51:15.572 --> 00:51:16.473
DIFFERENCE SIR -- I THINK IT'S

00:51:16.540 --> 00:51:18.475
JUST A MATTER OF WE NEED TO

00:51:18.542 --> 00:51:19.976
CONTINUE TO PULL LONG.

00:51:20.043 --> 00:51:20.877
AND THEN ALSO JUST AS A VERY

00:51:20.944 --> 00:51:22.479
BRIEF OUR I THINK PART OF THE

00:51:22.546 --> 00:51:23.079
PROBLEM IS WE SAW SOME VERY

00:51:23.146 --> 00:51:26.283
IMPORTANT PROGRESS LEADING UP TO

00:51:26.349 --> 00:51:26.883
TWENTY SIXTEEN ON THIS ISSUE.

00:51:26.950 --> 00:51:27.851
AND THEN THE DEPARTMENT

00:51:27.918 --> 00:51:29.653
EDUCATION ROLL BACK MANY OF

00:51:29.719 --> 00:51:30.921
THOSE EFFORTS -- HAD TO FEDERAL

00:51:30.987 --> 00:51:33.423
LEVEL AND SO AS A RESULT OF THAT --

00:51:33.490 --> 00:51:37.260
THERE'S BEEN NEW SPACE FOR SOME

00:51:37.327 --> 00:51:40.297
OF THOSE WHO WHO WANT TO TAKE

00:51:40.363 --> 00:51:41.131
ADVANTAGE OF BETTER STOP RATED.

00:51:41.198 --> 00:51:42.065
IN AND DURING THAT PERIOD

00:51:42.132 --> 00:51:43.567
MANAGER YOU KNOW I DID A LOT OF

00:51:43.633 --> 00:51:44.568
EXTENSIVE TRAVELING TO THE FOR

00:51:44.634 --> 00:51:46.236
PROFIT COLLEGES IN USERNAME SOME

00:51:46.303 --> 00:51:48.104
OF THE THE SUSPECT PLAYERS.

00:51:48.171 --> 00:51:50.207
IN THE PREDATORY PRACTICES BUT

00:51:50.273 --> 00:51:52.509
THERE ARE SEVERAL THAT DO HAVE

00:51:52.576 --> 00:51:55.045
THE BEST INTENTION OF OF OF THE

00:51:55.111 --> 00:51:57.614
VETERANS AND HEART I'M ACTUALLY

00:51:57.681 --> 00:52:01.051
OR YOU KNOW MAKING -- STRIDES IN

00:52:01.117 --> 00:52:02.652
SO I DON'T WANT IS COMING OFF IS

00:52:02.719 --> 00:52:04.454
IS THERE WERE ALL ONE SIDED AND

00:52:04.521 --> 00:52:07.524
EVERYBODY'S BAD THERE WERE ONES.

00:52:07.591 --> 00:52:09.359
ONCE THERE WERE INSTITUTIONS

00:52:09.426 --> 00:52:10.961
THAT WERE ACTUALLY GOING ABOVE

00:52:11.027 --> 00:52:12.562
AND BEYOND ALSO I WOULD LIKE

00:52:12.629 --> 00:52:18.635
THAT TO BE RECOGNIZE ALSO

00:52:18.702 --> 00:52:20.103
BECAUSE THEY ARE MAY KING THE

00:52:20.170 --> 00:52:21.505
EFFORT. TO ADVANCE OUR VETERANS

00:52:21.571 --> 00:52:23.807
IN TWOS YOU KNOW SUCCESS.

00:52:23.874 --> 00:52:25.709
SO WE JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE

00:52:25.775 --> 00:52:27.010
THAT WE ARE ACKNOWLEDGING THAT.

00:52:27.077 --> 00:52:29.479
ASSEMBLY MEMBER VOEPEL

00:52:29.546 --> 00:52:29.779
[inaudible]

00:52:29.846 --> 00:52:31.214
PROFESSOR MOST.

00:52:31.281 --> 00:52:31.815
VERY GOOD WORK YOU'RE DOING.

00:52:31.882 --> 00:52:36.219
IS YOU ARE SPOT ON IN.

00:52:36.286 --> 00:52:37.587
NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT I LEFT

00:52:37.654 --> 00:52:39.256
THE MILITARY.

00:52:39.322 --> 00:52:42.225
IT WAS A VERY VERY MURKY AREA.

00:52:42.292 --> 00:52:44.294
BECAUSE YOU'LL BE APPROACHED AS

00:52:44.361 --> 00:52:46.696
A VETERAN -- I HAD A HIGH SCHOOL

00:52:46.763 --> 00:52:49.332
EDUCATION SO YOU WANT TO GET

00:52:49.399 --> 00:52:49.666
SOME COLLEGE.

00:52:49.733 --> 00:52:53.537
BUT NOW MANY VETERANS 80% WERE

00:52:53.603 --> 00:52:55.872
LISTED.

00:52:55.939 --> 00:52:57.941
YOU MIGHT HAVE A WIFE.

00:52:58.008 --> 00:52:59.809
A SPOUSE.

00:52:59.876 --> 00:53:02.178
YOU MIGHT HAVE -- CHILDREN THAT

00:53:02.245 --> 00:53:04.848
YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR NOT EVEN

00:53:04.915 --> 00:53:05.482
BE MARRIED YOU MIGHT BE A SINGLE

00:53:05.549 --> 00:53:06.650
PARENT.

00:53:06.716 --> 00:53:08.618
SO THERE'S A WHOLE GAMUT THERE.

00:53:08.685 --> 00:53:10.820
SO PART OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING

00:53:10.887 --> 00:53:12.355
ABOUT COLLEAGUES.

00:53:12.422 --> 00:53:15.358
IS MANY TIMES VETERANS HAVE

00:53:15.425 --> 00:53:16.793
THEIR BACK AGAINST THE WALL.

00:53:16.860 --> 00:53:18.962
IN ORDER TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR

00:53:19.029 --> 00:53:20.530
OBLIGATIONS.

00:53:20.597 --> 00:53:22.465
THEY'VE GOT TO GO UNDER THE GI

00:53:22.532 --> 00:53:25.101
BILL ANY WHICH WAY THEY CAN.

00:53:25.168 --> 00:53:27.103
AND MANY TIMES ARE NOT.

00:53:27.170 --> 00:53:32.242
PARTICULARLY -- SMART ABOUT IT.

00:53:32.309 --> 00:53:33.343
I WAS OFFERED TO BECOME A

00:53:33.410 --> 00:53:35.979
HELICOPTER PILOT. FOR A

00:53:36.046 --> 00:53:38.582
GAZILLION DOLLARS.

00:53:38.648 --> 00:53:41.151
I WAS OFFERED -- ALL SORTS OF

00:53:41.217 --> 00:53:43.153
DIFFERENT WEIRD.

00:53:43.219 --> 00:53:46.423
COURSES FROM PRIVATE SCHOOLS BUT

00:53:46.489 --> 00:53:47.791
ON THE OTHER SIDE THE COOLING.

00:53:47.857 --> 00:53:49.492
I WAS OFFERED SOME VERY GOOD

00:53:49.559 --> 00:53:51.828
COURSES THEY COUNTED THAT HAD

00:53:51.895 --> 00:53:54.264
CREDIT SO.

00:53:54.331 --> 00:53:56.633
MY ASSOCIATE BEST FRAZIER IS

00:53:56.700 --> 00:53:58.468
SPOT ON THERE TOO SO WHAT I'M

00:53:58.535 --> 00:54:01.538
LOOKING AT IS LEGISLATION THAT

00:54:01.605 --> 00:54:03.907
WE CAN DO.

00:54:03.974 --> 00:54:05.609
NUMBER ONE THE FIRST LINE OF

00:54:05.675 --> 00:54:07.210
DEFENSE IN MY OPINION IS THE

00:54:07.277 --> 00:54:09.145
COUNTY VETERANS OFFICES

00:54:09.212 --> 00:54:11.047
THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA

00:54:11.114 --> 00:54:11.348
[inaudible]

00:54:11.414 --> 00:54:13.583
FUND THEM.

00:54:13.650 --> 00:54:15.752
SUPPORT THEM BECAUSE THE COUNTY

00:54:15.819 --> 00:54:17.787
VETERANS OFFICES WILL BE VALUE

00:54:17.854 --> 00:54:19.823
WAY.

00:54:19.889 --> 00:54:21.024
EACH VETERANS THAT'S WHAT

00:54:21.091 --> 00:54:22.759
THEY'RE THERE FOR IN A VERY GOOD

00:54:22.826 --> 00:54:23.927
AT IT.

00:54:23.994 --> 00:54:27.530
IN MOST CASES -- I WOULD LIKE TO

00:54:27.597 --> 00:54:28.965
SEE LEGISLATION.

00:54:29.032 --> 00:54:32.002
THAT WOULD GIVE EXTER.

00:54:32.068 --> 00:54:34.204
AUTHORITY TO THE COUNTY VETERANS

00:54:34.270 --> 00:54:37.140
OFFICES THAT WOULD BE GOOD.

00:54:37.207 --> 00:54:39.075
ESPECIALLY TO EVALUATE THE

00:54:39.142 --> 00:54:41.044
DIFFERENT COURSES.

00:54:41.111 --> 00:54:43.413
AND THAT WAY WE'RE NOT ONE SIZE

00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:46.082
FITS ALL WE CAN FIT EACH COUNTY

00:54:46.149 --> 00:54:48.885
BECAUSE CERTAIN COUNTIES HAVE A

00:54:48.952 --> 00:54:50.887
PREPONDERANCE OF NAVY MARINE

00:54:50.954 --> 00:54:53.089
VETERANS OTHER COUNTIES HAVE

00:54:53.156 --> 00:54:56.026
AIRFORCE OTHERS ARE ARMY. ONE

00:54:56.092 --> 00:54:58.361
POINT SEVEN MILLION VETERANS IN

00:54:58.428 --> 00:55:00.330
CALIFORNIA ANOTHER THING I'D

00:55:00.397 --> 00:55:03.266
LIKE TO SEE BECAUSE WE ONLY HAVE

00:55:03.333 --> 00:55:05.402
THIRTY SIX MONTHS OF GI BENEFITS.

00:55:05.468 --> 00:55:08.304
IS A TIME LINE. FOR A DEGREE A

00:55:08.371 --> 00:55:11.374
MATRIX BECAUSE RIGHT NOW

00:55:11.441 --> 00:55:12.676
VETERANS THAT I TALKED.

00:55:12.742 --> 00:55:15.111
TO WILL TAKE MORE THAN TWELVE

00:55:15.178 --> 00:55:16.613
CREDITS.

00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:18.081
SO THEY CAN STRETCH OUT THEIR

00:55:18.148 --> 00:55:20.784
BENEFITS BECAUSE ONCE AGAIN THIS

00:55:20.850 --> 00:55:23.520
ISN'T JUST TO GET A DEGREE. FOR

00:55:23.586 --> 00:55:26.423
MANY VETERANS THIS IS SURVIVAL.

00:55:26.489 --> 00:55:28.558
THIS IS THE CHECKED THEY GET

00:55:28.625 --> 00:55:30.960
THIS IS PAYING THE RENT.

00:55:31.027 --> 00:55:32.962
THEY'RE TELLING THEIR SPOUSES

00:55:33.029 --> 00:55:34.798
HEY I SERVE THE GOVERNMENT'S

00:55:34.864 --> 00:55:36.199
GOING TO TAKE CARE OF ME THEN

00:55:36.266 --> 00:55:37.434
THEY GET RIPPED OFF AND

00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:39.636
EXPLOITED IN A PRIVATE SECTOR

00:55:39.703 --> 00:55:40.937
BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT VERY

00:55:41.004 --> 00:55:42.639
SOPHISTICATED I WASN'T.

00:55:42.706 --> 00:55:44.874
IT TOOK ME FORTY YEARS TO GET

00:55:44.941 --> 00:55:46.676

01:15:17.446 --> 01:15:18.680
THAT MAKES US DO I THINK BETTER

01:15:18.747 --> 01:15:20.315
OUTREACH BUT ALSO BETTER

01:15:20.382 --> 01:15:22.017
INVESTIGATION.

01:15:22.084 --> 01:15:23.518
AND THEN IN THE ONES THAT YOU

01:15:23.585 --> 01:15:25.354
WERE ABLE TO CLOSE DO YOU HAVE A

01:15:25.420 --> 01:15:27.522
SENSE OF HOW MANY OF THOSE --

01:15:27.589 --> 01:15:29.157
CASES THAT YOU WERE ABLE TO

01:15:29.224 --> 01:15:32.461
CLOSE -- INVOLVED VETERANS THAT

01:15:32.527 --> 01:15:33.228
UNFORTUNATELY I DON'T HAVE THAT

01:15:33.295 --> 01:15:35.597
NUMBER BUT I CAN GET BACK TO YOU

01:15:35.664 --> 01:15:36.832
OKAY CRUCIATE THAT.

01:15:36.899 --> 01:15:39.501
AND THEN I QUESTIONS -- TO

01:15:39.568 --> 01:15:41.470
SECRETARY JOHNSON WHAT WHAT

01:15:41.536 --> 01:15:42.337
WOULD YOU THINK WOULD BE AN

01:15:42.404 --> 01:15:44.940
IDEAL WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH

01:15:45.007 --> 01:15:46.208
THE BUREAU FOR PRIVATE

01:15:46.275 --> 01:15:48.043
POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION HOW

01:15:48.110 --> 01:15:52.481
WOULD YOU DESCRIBE.

01:15:52.547 --> 01:15:53.682
AN IDEAL.

01:15:53.749 --> 01:15:54.349
RELATIONSHIP WITH.

01:15:54.416 --> 01:15:55.918
CAN I ANSWER THAT SHE CAN JUST

01:15:55.984 --> 01:15:58.053
COME BACK TO THE BUREAU.

01:15:58.120 --> 01:15:59.021
SORRY FROM RECRUITING.

01:15:59.087 --> 01:16:00.289
I I THINK THE BEST APPROACH

01:16:00.355 --> 01:16:02.457
WOULD BE FOR US TO COLLABORATE

01:16:02.524 --> 01:16:02.824
IN.

01:16:02.891 --> 01:16:04.626
INSURING THAT WHATEVER THE

01:16:04.693 --> 01:16:06.762
REQUIREMENTS ARE FOR THE STATE

01:16:06.828 --> 01:16:08.897
ARE BEING MET -- WHAT WE DO IT

01:16:08.964 --> 01:16:10.699
WOULD SEE SAVE IS WE WHAT WE

01:16:10.766 --> 01:16:12.267
WANT GRANT APPROVAL IF THE

01:16:12.334 --> 01:16:13.835
SCHOOL DOESN'T DEMONSTRATE

01:16:13.902 --> 01:16:15.804
COMPLIANCE FIRST?

01:16:15.871 --> 01:16:17.973
THAT'S IT AND SO THAT WILL TAKE

01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:20.676
SOME WORKING WITH -- THE BPP

01:16:20.742 --> 01:16:23.312
BECAUSE WHEN IT COMES TO YOUR

01:16:23.378 --> 01:16:25.414
RANTING AND INSTITUTION APPROVAL

01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:27.616
FOR TITLE THIRTY EIGHT ACCESS TO

01:16:27.683 --> 01:16:29.051
TURN TITLE THIRTY FUNDS.

01:16:29.117 --> 01:16:31.086
THE PREREQUISITE IS THAT THEY

01:16:31.153 --> 01:16:32.921
MUST BE APPROVED BY THE PIER FOR

01:16:32.988 --> 01:16:33.822
TWO YEARS.

01:16:33.889 --> 01:16:36.458
BEFORE THEY CAN EVEN APPLY TO US.

01:16:36.525 --> 01:16:38.894
SO -- BY THE TIME THE SCHOOL

01:16:38.961 --> 01:16:40.295
GETS TO US.

01:16:40.362 --> 01:16:41.830
THE HOPE IS THAT THEY'VE BEEN IN

01:16:41.897 --> 01:16:43.532
OPERATION OFFERING THEIR

01:16:43.598 --> 01:16:46.435
PROGRAMS OF EDUCATION AND DOING

01:16:46.501 --> 01:16:49.504
THAT SUCCESSFULLY -- OUR

01:16:49.571 --> 01:16:50.272
APPROACH IS.

01:16:50.339 --> 01:16:52.007
IS DIFFERENT BECAUSE OF WITH THE

01:16:52.074 --> 01:16:54.042
VA REQUIRES -- BUT WORKING

01:16:54.109 --> 01:16:55.177
TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:16:55.243 --> 01:16:57.112
THAT'S BEING LOOKED AT BEFORE

01:16:57.179 --> 01:16:58.547
THE GRANT OF APPROVAL IS

01:16:58.613 --> 01:17:00.115
ADMINISTERED THIS IS THE BEST

01:17:00.182 --> 01:17:01.283
APPROACH.

01:17:01.350 --> 01:17:02.918
THANK YOU AND WHAT IS YOUR

01:17:02.985 --> 01:17:03.952
WORKING RELATIONSHIP.

01:17:04.019 --> 01:17:06.755
LIKE WITH PUBLIC AND INDEPENDENT

01:17:06.822 --> 01:17:12.194
NON NON PROFIT SCHOOLS.

01:17:12.260 --> 01:17:13.228
WELL WE DON'T REALLY IT.

01:17:13.295 --> 01:17:15.130
BUT WE DON'T REALLY HAVE A

01:17:15.197 --> 01:17:16.465
RELATIONSHIP.

01:17:16.531 --> 01:17:21.069
THAT -- EMPOWERS ONE OVER THE

01:17:21.136 --> 01:17:23.739
OTHER -- WHAT WE DO IS WE DO

01:17:23.805 --> 01:17:26.174
OUTREACH EFFORTS FOR EXAMPLE WE?

01:17:26.241 --> 01:17:29.378
HAVE -- TRAINING SESSIONS THAT

01:17:29.444 --> 01:17:30.779
WE ARE IMPLEMENTING SO THE

01:17:30.846 --> 01:17:32.414
INSTITUTIONS CAN COME ASK

01:17:32.481 --> 01:17:34.116
WHATEVER THE QUESTIONS ARE SO

01:17:34.182 --> 01:17:34.916
THAT WE CAN.

01:17:34.983 --> 01:17:37.119
ESTABLISH COMPLAINTS BEFORE THE

01:17:37.185 --> 01:17:38.687
SUBMIT AN APPLICATION SO AND WE

01:17:38.754 --> 01:17:40.589
DO THAT FOR ANY INSTITUTION

01:17:40.655 --> 01:17:42.257
WHETHER IT'S PUBLIC PRIVATE FOR

01:17:42.324 --> 01:17:44.292
PROFIT NONPROFIT ALL THE

01:17:44.359 --> 01:17:46.395
INSTITUTIONS ARE INVITED. TO TO

01:17:46.461 --> 01:17:47.629
BE INVOLVED IN THAT AND THEN

01:17:47.696 --> 01:17:49.464
DOES THE LACK OF COORDINATING

01:17:49.531 --> 01:17:54.136
ANTIQUE ENTITY MAKE YOUR JOB.

01:17:54.202 --> 01:17:55.103
MORE DIFFICULT TO DO.

01:17:55.170 --> 01:17:56.805
I THINK WHAT MAKES MY JOB THE

01:17:56.872 --> 01:17:58.774
MOST DIFFICULT OR THIS BUT FOR

01:17:58.840 --> 01:17:59.808
THE STAFF IS.

01:17:59.875 --> 01:18:02.244
THE CONTRACT THE CONTRACT THAT

01:18:02.310 --> 01:18:04.713
THAT IS -- BETWEEN THE STATE OF

01:18:04.780 --> 01:18:07.282
CALIFORNIA AND THE D. THE BETTER

01:18:07.349 --> 01:18:07.816
THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS

01:18:07.883 --> 01:18:08.483
AFFAIRS.

01:18:08.550 --> 01:18:10.118
LIMITS OUR ABILITY TO DO

01:18:10.185 --> 01:18:12.220
ANYTHING OTHER THAN WHAT THEY

01:18:12.287 --> 01:18:13.755
CONTRACTORS TO DO.

01:18:13.822 --> 01:18:17.192
WITHOUT -- SPECIFIC STATE LAWS.

01:18:17.259 --> 01:18:19.694
THAT -- SAY WHAT WE CAN AND OVER

01:18:19.761 --> 01:18:21.696
WHAT THE STATE CALIFORNIA WANTS

01:18:21.763 --> 01:18:24.900
US TO DO WE MUST IT HERE TOO

01:18:24.966 --> 01:18:26.468
WHAT THEY REQUIRE US TO DO.

01:18:26.535 --> 01:18:28.070
THAT'S THE BIGGEST HURDLE.

01:18:28.136 --> 01:18:31.006
AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS WHEN --

01:18:31.073 --> 01:18:32.741
THE CALIFORNIA STATE APPROVING

01:18:32.808 --> 01:18:34.976
AGENCY FOR VETERANS EDUCATIONS

01:18:35.043 --> 01:18:38.947
LEARNS THAT THERE IS A TROUBLING

01:18:39.014 --> 01:18:40.549
INFORMATION ABOUT A SCHOOL.

01:18:40.615 --> 01:18:42.217
IS THIS IS THIS INFORMATION

01:18:42.284 --> 01:18:43.685
REPORTED TO ANYONE.

01:18:43.752 --> 01:18:47.622
WHEN YOU MEAN IN ADVANCE TO US

01:18:47.689 --> 01:18:47.923
[inaudible]

01:18:47.989 --> 01:18:48.957
IF YOU [inaudible]

01:18:49.024 --> 01:18:50.992
FIND OUT [inaudible]

01:18:51.059 --> 01:18:52.094
ANYTHING.

01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:53.995
CONCERNING CONCERNING ANY

01:18:54.062 --> 01:18:55.430
DECISION YES OR FOR THE

01:18:55.497 --> 01:18:57.399
INSTITUTION.

01:18:57.466 --> 01:18:58.934
IS THAT INFORMATION SHARE.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.670
IT IS SHARED AND WITH WHOM WITH

01:19:01.736 --> 01:19:04.172
THE BUREAU -- RIGHT AND MY LAST

01:19:04.239 --> 01:19:10.178
QUESTION -- WHAT OUR STUDENTS

01:19:10.245 --> 01:19:12.147
VETERANS AND SERVICE MEMBERS?

01:19:12.214 --> 01:19:14.749
FOR ME AT LEAST AS IT RELATES TO

01:19:14.816 --> 01:19:16.718
CALVET AND SEE SAVE.

01:19:16.785 --> 01:19:18.920
THEIR ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER PUT

01:19:18.987 --> 01:19:21.823
THE LAW ON THE BOOKS AB TWENTY

01:19:21.890 --> 01:19:22.858
NINETY NINE THAT'S WHAT CODIFIED

01:19:22.924 --> 01:19:24.126
AND SEE SAVE IN LAW.

01:19:24.192 --> 01:19:26.761
UNFORTUNATELY WHAT WE FOUND IS

01:19:26.828 --> 01:19:29.231
THAT WHILE WE HAVE THE AUTHORITY.

01:19:29.297 --> 01:19:30.966
TO HAVE SCHOOLS APPLY TO US WHEN

01:19:31.032 --> 01:19:33.368
WE WERE IN LITIGATION WHAT WE

01:19:33.435 --> 01:19:34.636
FOUND IS THAT WE WERE APPLYING

01:19:34.703 --> 01:19:36.271
FEDERAL LAW BECAUSE THERE AREN'T

01:19:36.338 --> 01:19:37.305
ANY STATE LAWS.

01:19:37.372 --> 01:19:40.675
SO WE LACK THE SUPPORT

01:19:40.742 --> 01:19:40.976
[inaudible]

01:19:41.042 --> 01:19:42.944
LEGISLATIVELY MEANING WE HAVE NO

01:19:43.011 --> 01:19:44.980
LAWS TO DEFEND WHAT ACTIONS THAT

01:19:45.046 --> 01:19:46.715
WE TAKE OTHER THAN THE FEDERAL

01:19:46.781 --> 01:19:47.549
LAW.

01:19:47.616 --> 01:19:49.618
SO THEN THAT'S WHEN THE VA GETS

01:19:49.684 --> 01:19:51.253
TO COME IN AND SAY.

01:19:51.319 --> 01:19:52.554
YOU'RE NOT DOING THAT WITH OUR

01:19:52.621 --> 01:19:54.256
MONEY YOU'RE GOING TO DO

01:19:54.322 --> 01:19:55.490
COMPLIANCE OR RACE CHECK THE

01:19:55.557 --> 01:19:57.559
MONEY AUDIT THE STUDENTS.

01:19:57.626 --> 01:20:00.495
WE THEY ARE NOT PAYING FOR THEIR

01:20:00.562 --> 01:20:01.963
THIS IS HOW THEY COMMUNICATED TO

01:20:02.030 --> 01:20:03.431
US IS THAT THEY'RE NOT PAYING

01:20:03.498 --> 01:20:05.300
FOR THAT SERVICE AND SO WE HAVE

01:20:05.367 --> 01:20:06.468
THE LAW.

01:20:06.535 --> 01:20:07.769
BUT WE HAVE NO ENFORCEMENT OF

01:20:07.836 --> 01:20:09.304
THE LAW BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE

01:20:09.371 --> 01:20:11.973
STATE LAW. TO ENFORCE WHAT IT IS.

01:20:12.040 --> 01:20:13.775
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WANTS US

01:20:13.842 --> 01:20:14.142
TO DO.

01:20:14.209 --> 01:20:15.410
SO WERE CAUGHT.

01:20:15.477 --> 01:20:17.779
IN A CATCH TWENTY TWO YES THE

01:20:17.846 --> 01:20:19.447
WORK THAT WE DO WERE DESPERATELY

01:20:19.514 --> 01:20:22.551
TRYING -- TO INSURE THAT WE LOOK

01:20:22.617 --> 01:20:24.186
AT THINGS IN ADVANCE BUT THE

01:20:24.252 --> 01:20:25.754
ENFORCEMENT OF IT NOW HAS BEEN

01:20:25.820 --> 01:20:27.556
TAKEN AWAY FROM US THAT NEW

01:20:27.622 --> 01:20:29.291
POLICY ADVISORY THAT CAME OUT.

01:20:29.357 --> 01:20:30.825
FROM THE A AUGUST THIRTIETH

BASICALLY SAYS -- THEY DON'T

01:20:34.930 --> 01:20:36.698
CARE.

01:20:36.765 --> 01:20:37.299
IF THE SCHOOLS BET GOOD BETTER

01:20:37.365 --> 01:20:38.867
INDIFFERENT WE ARE TO LISTEN TO

01:20:38.934 --> 01:20:40.535
ANY OTHER STATE NOT JUST THE

01:20:40.602 --> 01:20:41.670
BUREAU.

INCLUDING ACCREDITATION THAT

01:20:48.610 --> 01:20:51.246
MEANS THAT IF.

01:20:51.313 --> 01:20:52.948
THAT INTO T. WHATEVER THE ENTITY

01:20:53.014 --> 01:20:54.649
IS DOESN'T TAKE AN ACTION YOU

01:20:54.716 --> 01:20:57.185
CANNOT WHICH MEANS VETERANS ARE

01:20:57.252 --> 01:20:58.019
NOT BEING PROTECTED.

01:20:58.086 --> 01:20:59.421

PIECES OF LEGISLATION AND SOME

01:21:16.071 --> 01:21:17.606
STEPS THAT WE CAN TAKE WHICH

01:21:17.672 --> 01:21:20.609
WOULD STRENGTHEN YOUR ABILITY.

TO HOLD THE SPOT ACTORS

01:21:22.077 --> 01:21:23.945

GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS --

01:21:35.457 --> 01:21:38.093
WHERE WE ESTABLISHED -- WHAT WE

01:21:38.159 --> 01:21:41.096
HOPE WOULD BE SUPPORTED BY --

EVERYONE IN CALIFORNIA.

01:21:42.931 --> 01:21:44.633
TO HELP US IN FORCE WHAT IT IS

01:21:44.699 --> 01:21:46.301
YOU REALLY HAVE SEEN US DO OVER

01:21:46.368 --> 01:21:48.470
THE LAST FIVE YEARS WE WE DIDN'T

01:21:48.536 --> 01:21:50.405
DEVIATE FROM ANYTHING THAT WE

01:21:50.472 --> 01:21:52.040
HAVE DONE BEFORE IT MEANS THAT.

01:21:52.107 --> 01:21:53.108
IT WOULD HOLD SCHOOLS

01:21:53.174 --> 01:21:55.844
ACCOUNTABLE IN ADVANCE IT WOULD

01:21:55.910 --> 01:21:57.412
REQUIRE THAT THE INSTITUTION.

01:21:57.479 --> 01:21:59.781
THE THE FIRST PART OF ASSEMBLY

01:21:59.848 --> 01:22:01.449
MEMBERS OF THE FRESHEST BILL

01:22:01.516 --> 01:22:02.917
SAID THAT THEY MUST APPLY BUT

01:22:02.984 --> 01:22:04.386
THAT'S ALL IT SAID IS THAT THEY

01:22:04.452 --> 01:22:05.787
MUST APPLY TO ASK.

01:22:05.854 --> 01:22:08.189
SO WE WENT UP BEYOND THAT TO SAY

01:22:08.256 --> 01:22:09.324
BUT THESE ARE THE TH THE

01:22:09.391 --> 01:22:10.992
ADDITIONAL THINGS THAT NEED TO

01:22:11.059 --> 01:22:12.927
BE DONE THAT THEY HAVE TO DO

01:22:12.994 --> 01:22:14.629
THINGS THAT THEY HAVE TO REPORT

I APPRECIATE THAT BECAUSE IT

01:25:22.851 --> 01:25:24.886
REALLY JUST DEPENDS ON HOW MUCH

01:25:24.953 --> 01:25:27.188
MORE SUPPORT WE GET WITH THE LAW

01:25:27.255 --> 01:25:28.723

THE TWO MILLION DOLLARS THAT THE

01:25:30.492 --> 01:25:32.460
THE FEDS PAY TO THE STATE COVERS

01:25:32.527 --> 01:25:35.029

01:25:38.166 --> 01:25:39.234
NOTHING.

01:25:39.300 --> 01:25:42.070
LEFT TO DO WHAT WE WOULD WANT

01:25:42.136 --> 01:25:44.072
WHICH WOULD BE TO FOR OVERSIGHT

01:25:44.138 --> 01:25:44.973

01:25:52.580 --> 01:25:53.515
NOTHING.

01:25:53.581 --> 01:25:54.816
THE THE VA EVEN WHEN WE HAVE

01:25:54.883 --> 01:25:55.717
THESE LEVELS I STILL HAVE THE

01:25:55.783 --> 01:25:57.218
CHALLENGE OF DOING THE EXACT

01:25:57.285 --> 01:25:59.087
SAME THING WITH THE STATE LAW

01:25:59.153 --> 01:26:01.656
BEING IN EFFECT -- I'M GOING TO

01:26:01.723 --> 01:26:03.658
BE BALLOTS IN TRYING TO BALANCE

01:26:03.725 --> 01:26:05.760
BETWEEN OKAY HOW MUCH OF MY

01:26:05.827 --> 01:26:08.029
STAFF TIME CAN BE ALLOCATED

01:26:08.096 --> 01:26:09.097
TOWARDS.

01:26:09.163 --> 01:26:10.598
DOING WHAT THE STATE'S

01:26:10.665 --> 01:26:13.768
PRIORITIES ARE -- AND THEN Vì

01:26:13.835 --> 01:26:16.004
ã PAY FOR IT IT'S GOING TO BE

01:26:16.070 --> 01:26:16.905
A CHALLENGE THAT'S WHERE WE'VE

01:26:16.971 --> 01:26:18.606
BEEN THAT'S WHERE WE'VE BEEN

01:26:18.673 --> 01:26:20.041
OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS AND I

01:26:20.108 --> 01:26:21.209
THINK THEY NEED TO COME TO THE

01:26:21.276 --> 01:26:22.477
FOREFRONT BECAUSE WHAT I'M

01:26:22.544 --> 01:26:23.177
SAYING IS.

01:26:23.244 --> 01:26:25.013
YOUR WORKLOAD IS GOING TO

01:26:25.079 --> 01:26:26.881
INCREASE YES WITH THE ADDITIONAL

01:26:26.948 --> 01:26:27.949
RESPONSIBILITY THAT IS CORRECT

01:26:28.016 --> 01:26:30.919
SO IT HAS TO BE IN THE

01:26:30.985 --> 01:26:32.453
LEGISLATION THAT THE TO THE WITH

01:26:32.520 --> 01:26:33.254
THE ADDITIONAL WORKLOAD THAT HAS

01:26:33.321 --> 01:26:34.689
TO BE A FUNDING MECHANISM TO BE

01:26:34.756 --> 01:26:36.391
ABLE.

01:26:36.457 --> 01:26:40.428
TO ADJUST TO THAT THAT WORK LOOK.

01:26:40.495 --> 01:26:41.996

BEING SAID IS YOU KNOW.

01:26:42.764 --> 01:26:43.831
WHEN WE WORK ON THIS EARLIER ON

01:26:43.898 --> 01:26:45.099
WE DID HAVE TO TAKE SOME

01:26:45.166 --> 01:26:47.635
AMENDMENTS DUE TO SOME SOME?

01:26:47.702 --> 01:26:49.103
HIGH LEVEL PRESSURE TWENTY WHICH

01:26:49.170 --> 01:26:50.405

01:26:50.471 --> 01:26:51.372
CERTAIN EXTENT.

01:26:51.439 --> 01:26:52.607
I THINK THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT

01:26:52.674 --> 01:26:55.109

ANOTHER BUREAU BOARD.

01:28:40.114 --> 01:28:42.216

CAN GIVE ME AN ESTIMATE ON I

01:29:14.282 --> 01:29:15.616
MEAN IF YOU HAVE.

01:29:15.683 --> 01:29:17.518
AROUND TWELVE HUNDRED COMPLAINTS

01:29:17.585 --> 01:29:19.353

THE COMPLAINTS ABSOLUTELY I MEAN

01:29:36.904 --> 01:29:38.573
THAT JUST MAKES LOGICAL SENSE

01:29:38.639 --> 01:29:40.274
BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE A BEGINNING

01:29:40.341 --> 01:29:42.310
TO KNOW.

01:29:42.376 --> 01:29:43.578
HOW LONG IS THE AVERAGE COMPLAIN

01:29:45.513 --> 01:29:48.449
IMPROVEMENT IS OR?

01:29:48.516 --> 01:29:50.151
I FOUND IN THE CORPORATE WORLD

01:29:50.218 --> 01:29:51.719
THAT WHEN YOU PUT MORE EYES ON A

01:29:51.786 --> 01:29:54.489
PROBLEM SOMETIMES IT EXTENDS THE

01:29:54.555 --> 01:29:56.157
PROBLEM BECAUSE NOW.

01:29:56.224 --> 01:29:58.292
YOU'RE ANALYZING MORE DATA MORE

01:29:58.359 --> 01:30:00.328
INFORMATION YOU FOUND MORE

01:30:00.394 --> 01:30:02.230
PROBLEMS THAN WHAT YOU THOUGHT

01:30:02.296 --> 01:30:03.164
YOU HAD.

01:30:03.231 --> 01:30:05.867
SO YOU NEVER KNOW YES ABSOLUTELY

01:30:05.933 --> 01:30:09.337
OKAY -- LAST QUESTION

01:30:09.403 --> 01:30:09.637
[inaudible]

01:30:09.704 --> 01:30:11.139
UNACCREDITED SCHOOLS.

01:30:11.205 --> 01:30:13.441
AND I'M NOT HUNTING HERE OKAY

01:30:13.508 --> 01:30:16.077
THIS IS A OF OF BASIC QUESTION

01:30:16.144 --> 01:30:18.146
NUMBER.

01:30:18.212 --> 01:30:18.846
EIGHTY SIX NOT LOOK AT IT

01:30:18.913 --> 01:30:20.448
UNACCREDITED SCHOOLS NOT

01:30:20.515 --> 01:30:23.951
NECESSARILY BAD OR GOOD -- I'M%

01:30:24.018 --> 01:30:25.953
THINKING IN MY HEAD MY LITTLE

01:30:26.020 --> 01:30:26.754
NOODLE.

01:30:26.821 --> 01:30:28.589
THAT UNACCREDITED SCHOOLS COULD

01:30:28.656 --> 01:30:31.025
VERY WELL BE NEW SCHOOLS NEW

01:30:31.092 --> 01:30:33.227
EDUCATION CONCEPTS THAT JUST

01:30:33.294 --> 01:30:35.062
HAVEN'T BEEN ACCEPTED YET OR

01:30:35.129 --> 01:30:37.131
ACCREDITED WAR THEY JUST

01:30:37.198 --> 01:30:39.000
HAPPENED -- MARKED OFF ALL THE

01:30:39.066 --> 01:30:41.836
BOXES IS THAT A GOOD WAY FOR ME

01:30:41.903 --> 01:30:42.970
TO THINK OF THAT WILL IT AN

01:30:43.037 --> 01:30:44.906
ACCREDITED SCHOOL I MEAN IT'S BY

01:30:44.972 --> 01:30:45.473
CHOICE.

01:30:45.540 --> 01:30:47.341
TRANSPORTATION IS BY CHOICE

01:30:47.408 --> 01:30:49.510
WHETHER SCHOOL DECIDES TO DO

01:30:49.577 --> 01:30:52.513
THAT -- SO WHAT HAPPENS IS IS

01:30:52.580 --> 01:30:54.115
THAT WHEN AN INSTITUTION APPLIES

01:30:54.182 --> 01:31:00.087
TO US -- IF THEY HAVE NOT BEEN

01:31:00.154 --> 01:31:00.555

RECOGNIZED AS ON A CREDIT IT.

01:31:03.491 --> 01:31:04.659
THEY MAY NOT HAVE CHOSEN THAT

01:31:04.725 --> 01:31:05.293
BECAUSE FINANCIALLY IT MAY NOT

01:31:05.359 --> 01:31:07.395
MAKE SENSE TO THEM -- TYPICALLY

01:31:07.461 --> 01:31:08.696
YOU WOULD FIND IT THE

01:31:08.763 --> 01:31:10.131
UNACCREDITED INSTITUTIONS ARE

01:31:10.198 --> 01:31:12.300
THOSE WHO SMALLER INSTITUTIONS

01:31:12.366 --> 01:31:13.334

01:32:02.984 --> 01:32:04.318
THINGS THAT WE DO IT WITH MY

01:32:09.523 --> 01:32:11.425
THEY NEED TO IF YOU SAY BROWN

01:32:11.492 --> 01:32:11.993
NUMBER FOR THE SAKE OF THIS

01:32:12.059 --> 01:32:14.328
CONVERSATION THAT FIFTY PEOPLE

01:32:14.395 --> 01:32:16.731

THAT.

01:32:19.467 --> 01:32:20.935
JOB WERE EMPLOYED IN THE FIELD.

01:32:21.002 --> 01:32:22.803
THEN WE VALIDATE THAT WE

01:32:22.870 --> 01:32:24.672
VALIDATE THE INFORMATION WOULD.

01:32:24.739 --> 01:32:26.007
EITHER YOU'RE PRESENTING US WITH

ACTUAL DATA ARE YOU NOT.

01:32:27.675 --> 01:32:29.877
THAT MEANS YOU SEND US FIFTY

01:32:29.944 --> 01:32:31.012

01:32:31.078 --> 01:32:32.413
WE LOOK THROUGH THOSE WE

01:32:32.480 --> 01:32:33.648
RANDOMLY.

01:32:33.714 --> 01:32:36.050

01:32:47.061 --> 01:32:48.596
THE PROGRAM.

01:32:48.663 --> 01:32:49.797
THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS

01:32:49.864 --> 01:32:50.298
THAT THE VA SAYS THAT WE

01:32:50.364 --> 01:32:52.366
SHOULDN'T DO.

01:32:52.433 --> 01:32:54.368
THEY DON'T WANT US GOING INTO

01:32:54.435 --> 01:32:56.971
THAT LEVEL OF DETAIL -- THERE

01:32:57.038 --> 01:32:58.973
ARE EVEN INSTITUTIONS WHERE WE

01:32:59.040 --> 01:33:00.608
SAY -- THEY SUBMIT THEIR

01:33:00.675 --> 01:33:02.843

IF YOU DON'T WE WON'T APPROVE

01:33:13.220 --> 01:33:14.622
YOU.

01:33:14.689 --> 01:33:16.223
Vì ã SAYS THAT'S TOO FAR.

01:33:16.290 --> 01:33:17.625
THEIR CREDIT IT THEY SHOULD BE

01:33:17.692 --> 01:33:19.160
APPROVED BY US.

01:33:19.226 --> 01:33:21.996
SO IT HAS TO LITERALLY.

01:33:22.063 --> 01:33:24.465
TAKEN OUT ALL OF THE PROTECTIONS

01:33:24.532 --> 01:33:25.933
THAT WE THOUGHT WE WERE PUTTING

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.469
IN PLACE TO ENSURE THAT YOU CAN.

01:33:28.536 --> 01:33:30.137
THEY CAN OFFER THE PROGRAM IT

01:33:30.204 --> 01:33:31.872
JUST WON'T BE FOR VETERANS UNTIL

01:33:31.939 --> 01:33:33.107
THEY CAN DEMONSTRATE THAT THEY

01:33:33.174 --> 01:33:34.675
MEET THE STANDARD THEY NEED TO

01:33:34.742 --> 01:33:37.011
COME UP AND BE ABLE TO INSURE

01:33:37.078 --> 01:33:39.714
BECAUSE WHAT'S AT RISK IS NOT

01:33:39.780 --> 01:33:40.648
JUST BENEFIT.

01:33:40.715 --> 01:33:42.450
LIKE -- MISS RUTH WAS SENT ITS

01:33:44.285 --> 01:33:45.586
CERTAIN WINDOW.

01:33:45.653 --> 01:33:48.556
SO IF FOR EIGHTEEN MONTHS THEIR

01:33:48.622 --> 01:33:49.991
CREDITORS SAYS ALL YOU CAN KEEP

01:33:50.057 --> 01:33:51.759

01:34:00.968 --> 01:34:03.104
SO WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO DO IT

01:34:03.170 --> 01:34:04.672
ON THE BEGINNING AT THE

01:34:04.739 --> 01:34:06.140
BEGINNING TO NOT GIVE YOU

DIFFICULT TO TAKE IT ONCE IT'S

01:34:10.945 --> 01:34:12.346
BEEN ISSUED.

01:34:12.413 --> 01:34:14.015
OKAY AND THEN ALSO IS SO IS IT

01:34:14.081 --> 01:34:14.882
CORRECT TO SAY THAT IF THE

THAT WE SERVE.

01:36:29.183 --> 01:36:30.184
I THINK THAT I'M IN A GOOD

01:36:30.251 --> 01:36:31.719
POSITION TO SPEAK.

01:36:31.785 --> 01:36:34.688
ABOUT THE CURRENT NEEDS OF THE

01:36:34.755 --> 01:36:36.123
SERVICE MEMBERS THAT WE TOUCH.

01:36:36.190 --> 01:36:38.659
ON AVERAGE MOST OF MY CLIENTS

01:36:38.726 --> 01:36:41.795

01:36:41.862 --> 01:36:43.063
HUNDRED PLACEMENTS RIGHT NOW.

01:36:43.130 --> 01:36:44.798
SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE

01:36:44.865 --> 01:36:46.901
AND MOST OF MY CLIENTS HAVE USED

01:36:46.967 --> 01:36:49.737
THE GI BILL OR USING THE GI BILL

01:36:49.803 --> 01:36:52.506
IN SOME CAPACITY OR ANOTHER. ONE

01:36:52.573 --> 01:36:53.841
OF THE BIGGEST ADVANTAGES THAT

01:36:53.908 --> 01:36:56.110
WE SEE ABOUT HAVING THE GI BILL

01:36:56.177 --> 01:36:56.377
BENEFITS.

01:36:56.443 --> 01:36:57.478
IS.

01:36:57.545 --> 01:36:59.547
YOUR ABILITY TO HAVE A LITTLE

01:36:59.613 --> 01:37:00.881
BIT OF A CUSHIONING PERIOD

01:37:00.948 --> 01:37:02.383
ALMOST.

01:37:02.449 --> 01:37:04.685
SO THERE'S NOT A LOT OF THERE'S

01:37:04.752 --> 01:37:06.020
NOT AS MUCH PRESSURE I WOULD SAY

01:37:06.086 --> 01:37:07.821
ON AVERAGE FOR SOMEONE TO COME

01:37:07.888 --> 01:37:09.957
OUT OF THE ACTIVE DUTY SAVE BY A

01:37:10.024 --> 01:37:14.061
WAY OF TAPS ARE CAL TAPS. TO GO

01:37:14.128 --> 01:37:16.063
IMMEDIATELY INTO THE FIRST JOB

01:37:16.130 --> 01:37:18.933
THEY FIND BECAUSE THEY NEED THE

01:37:18.999 --> 01:37:20.501
FINANCES SO SO QUICKLY.

01:37:20.568 --> 01:37:22.269
WHAT WE'RE SEEING NOW IS A

01:37:22.336 --> 01:37:24.805
TENDENCY TO HOLD OFF TO PURSUE

01:37:24.872 --> 01:37:27.775
THE EDUCATION OR IN SOME CASES

01:37:27.841 --> 01:37:30.578
PURSUE THE VOCATIONAL TECHNICAL

01:37:30.644 --> 01:37:33.314
SCHOOL THE APPRENTICESHIP --

01:37:33.380 --> 01:37:34.348
WHATEVER IT IS THAT THEY CHOOSE.

01:37:34.415 --> 01:37:36.483
BUT THE THE BEST VALUE THAT I

01:37:36.550 --> 01:37:38.419
SEE OF THE GI BILL IS THE

01:37:38.485 --> 01:37:39.853
ABILITY TO BE FLEXIBLE WITH

01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:41.021
THOSE DECISIONS.

01:37:41.088 --> 01:37:45.159
AND THEN TO TAKE YOUR TIME AND

01:37:45.226 --> 01:37:46.760
REALLY.

01:37:46.827 --> 01:37:47.728
DECIDE WHAT YOU WANT TO DO AND

01:37:47.795 --> 01:37:49.697
ALSO BECAUSE IT IS SUCH A RECORD

01:37:49.763 --> 01:37:51.532
UNEMPLOYMENT ACROSS THE STATE.

01:37:51.599 --> 01:37:52.633
TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE

01:37:52.700 --> 01:37:54.568
OPPORTUNITY TO ALMOST LIKE A

01:37:54.635 --> 01:37:56.003

01:38:05.279 --> 01:38:06.447
JOBS AND PUTTING THEM INTO

01:38:06.513 --> 01:38:07.181
CAREERS.

01:38:07.248 --> 01:38:08.549
PUTTING HIM INTO NEXT LEVEL

01:38:08.616 --> 01:38:10.884
EMPLOYMENT AND WITHOUT HAVING

01:38:10.951 --> 01:38:12.219
THE GI BILL BENEFITS.

01:38:12.286 --> 01:38:15.322
I'M NOT SURE THAT THEY WOULD BE

01:38:15.389 --> 01:38:22.863
AS COMPETITIVE.

01:38:22.930 --> 01:38:24.431

01:39:39.006 --> 01:39:39.807
THAT DATA.

01:39:39.873 --> 01:39:41.408
MANY U. S. VETERAN SEPARATE FROM

THE MILITARY AND ENCOUNTER

01:39:42.776 --> 01:39:44.745

01:39:54.888 --> 01:39:55.656
VETERANS.

01:39:55.723 --> 01:39:56.990
MANY SERVICE MEMBERS SEPARATE

01:39:57.057 --> 01:39:58.625
FROM THE MILITARY ILL EQUIPPED

01:39:58.692 --> 01:40:00.494
TO BEGIN THEIR CIVILIAN LIVES BY

01:40:00.561 --> 01:40:02.529

01:40:08.001 --> 01:40:09.737
THESE ISSUES MAY BE COMPOUNDED

01:40:09.803 --> 01:40:11.372
BY VETERANS NEED TO ADJUST TO

01:40:20.347 --> 01:40:22.516
NOT BE AWARE OF THE IMPACT THAT

01:40:22.583 --> 01:40:26.019
SERVED IN THE MILITARY CAN HAVE.

01:40:26.086 --> 01:40:26.587
I BET THOSE SERVED IN THE

01:40:26.653 --> 01:40:27.588
MILITARY CAN HAVE ON THE ABILITY

01:40:27.654 --> 01:40:28.856
OF VETERANS STUDENTS TO COPE

01:40:28.922 --> 01:40:30.624
WITH AND OVERCOME MANY OF THE

01:40:30.691 --> 01:40:33.093
CHALLENGES THAT I JUST MENTIONED.

01:40:33.160 --> 01:40:34.895
SOME OF THE I IMPORTANT DATA

01:40:34.962 --> 01:40:36.530
THAT I JUST WANTED TO BRIEFLY --

01:40:36.597 --> 01:40:38.298
GO OVER WITH YOU A SNAPSHOT OF

01:40:38.365 --> 01:40:40.134
WHAT OUR VETERANS LOOK LIKE AND

01:40:40.200 --> 01:40:41.869
COMMUNITY COLLEGES IS THE AGE

01:40:41.935 --> 01:40:44.371
RANGE IS ABOUT TWENTY ONE TO

01:40:44.438 --> 01:40:46.640
FORTY GENERALLY STE TWENTY FOUR

01:40:46.707 --> 01:40:47.141
TO TWENTY TO THIRTY FIVE

01:40:47.207 --> 01:40:47.775
NEEDLESS TO SAY BECAUSE THEY'VE

01:40:47.841 --> 01:40:49.243
SERVED BY ANYWHERE FROM ONE TO

01:40:49.309 --> 01:40:50.344
EIGHT YEARS IN THE MILITARY WHEN.

01:40:50.411 --> 01:40:51.311
THEY COME OUT.

01:40:51.378 --> 01:40:53.580
MOSTLY A MALE POPULATION WE HAVE

01:40:53.647 --> 01:40:55.516
A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF FEMALES IN

01:40:55.582 --> 01:40:56.850
THERE BUT GENERALLY IT'S MALES

01:40:56.917 --> 01:40:59.253
MOSTLY MARINES AND ARMY BECAUSE

01:40:59.319 --> 01:41:00.721
THOSE ARE THAT THE LARGEST

01:41:00.788 --> 01:41:02.356
GROUPS THEY'RE OUT THERE YOU

01:41:02.423 --> 01:41:03.290
WON'T SAY THEY SEE THAT SAN

01:41:03.357 --> 01:41:05.993
DIEGO THOUGH YOU'LL SEE A LOT OF

01:41:06.059 --> 01:41:07.494
NAVY OUT THERE -- ACCORDING TO

01:41:07.561 --> 01:41:09.096
OUR DAILY WE LOOK ON HERE THAT

01:41:09.163 --> 01:41:11.698
61% HAVE SERVED IN COMBAT ZONE

01:41:11.765 --> 01:41:14.435
OR DEPLOYED TO FLOAT -- AND 70%

01:41:14.501 --> 01:41:15.936
SUFFERED ILLNESS OR INJURY FROM

01:41:16.003 --> 01:41:17.938
SERVICE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THOSE

01:41:18.005 --> 01:41:19.640
NUMBERS AND YOU THINK ABOUT THE

01:41:19.706 --> 01:41:21.942
ILLNESS OR INJURY MY BACKGROUND

01:41:22.009 --> 01:41:23.677
IS IN NURSING IT ALWAYS HAS BEEN

01:41:23.744 --> 01:41:25.212
I FELL IN LOVE WITH VETERANS

01:41:25.279 --> 01:41:26.980
YEARS AGO AT MY LAST COLLEGES

01:41:27.047 --> 01:41:28.315
REDUCE COLLEGE WHEN A MARINE

01:41:28.382 --> 01:41:29.450
WALKED IN AND ASKED.

01:41:29.516 --> 01:41:30.517
ME IF I WOULD HELP THEM SET UP A

01:41:30.584 --> 01:41:32.052
VETERAN RESOURCE CENTER AND I

01:41:32.119 --> 01:41:33.120
TOLD THEM I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING

01:41:33.187 --> 01:41:34.455
ABOUT VETERANS.

01:41:34.521 --> 01:41:36.156
HI I SET MYSELF OFF AND I DID

01:41:36.223 --> 01:41:37.591
RESEARCH THAT WAS PROBABLY TO

01:41:37.658 --> 01:41:39.726
FEET TALL AND I FIGURED IT OUT

01:41:39.793 --> 01:41:41.361
WHAT THEY REALLY NEEDED WAS

01:41:41.428 --> 01:41:43.263
SUPPORT SERVICES THEY NEEDED

01:41:43.330 --> 01:41:44.998
SOMETHING TO HELP THEM ACCLIMATE

01:41:45.065 --> 01:41:46.967
BACK AND WE NEEDED TO PROVIDE

01:41:47.034 --> 01:41:48.235
THE SERVICES BEFORE THEY CAN

01:41:48.302 --> 01:41:49.870
ACTUALLY BE IN COLLEGE AND

01:41:49.937 --> 01:41:50.103
REALLY.

01:41:50.170 --> 01:41:52.005
DO WELL BECAUSE THEY'RE WASTING

01:41:52.072 --> 01:41:53.707
THEIR BENEFITS THAT'S THE WHOLE

01:41:53.774 --> 01:41:54.908
BOTTOM LINE RIGHT THERE.

01:41:54.975 --> 01:41:56.777
SO SOME OF THE HEALTH CONCERNS

01:41:56.844 --> 01:41:57.744
THAT I LOOKED AT AND THEN I

01:41:57.811 --> 01:41:59.580
FOUND THE VA LOOKS AT A LOT OF

01:41:59.646 --> 01:42:01.782
THEM THE THREE MOST FREQUENT

01:42:01.849 --> 01:42:03.484
VISITED HEALTH CONCERNS ARE

01:42:03.550 --> 01:42:04.918
MUSCULAR SKELETAL.

01:42:04.985 --> 01:42:07.187
MIDDLE DISORDERS AND SIGNS AND

01:42:07.254 --> 01:42:09.623
SYMPTOMS OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN THEY

01:42:09.690 --> 01:42:10.224
DON'T KNOW WHERE IT'S COMING

01:42:10.290 --> 01:42:12.426
FROM THEIR HEARING LOSS IS ONE

01:42:12.493 --> 01:42:14.361
OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS AND I

01:42:14.428 --> 01:42:15.362
WILL TELL YOU RIGHT NOW THAT IF

01:42:15.429 --> 01:42:16.630
YOU'RE A COLLEGE SETTING I DON'T

01:42:16.697 --> 01:42:17.865
CARE WHERE YOU ARE IF YOU HAVE

01:42:17.931 --> 01:42:18.732
HEARING LOSS.

01:42:18.799 --> 01:42:20.400
YOU REALLY HAVE A DEFICIT WHEN

01:42:20.467 --> 01:42:22.436
YOU GO IN THERE -- THE PROBLEM

01:42:22.503 --> 01:42:23.904
THAT I SEE WITH THE VA HEALTH

01:42:23.971 --> 01:42:26.039
CARE SYSTEM IS THERE IS A ONE

01:42:26.106 --> 01:42:27.941
YEAR WAIT TO EVEN GET AN

01:42:28.008 --> 01:42:30.210
APPOINTMENT WITH AN AUDIOLOGIST.

01:42:30.277 --> 01:42:31.845
TO ASSESS THE HEARING NEED IT

01:42:31.912 --> 01:42:33.680
COST TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS

01:42:33.747 --> 01:42:35.215
TO GET THE HEARING DEVICES IN

01:42:35.282 --> 01:42:37.050
YEARS TO BE ABLE TO HEAR THEIR

01:42:37.117 --> 01:42:38.485
AND I HAVE HAD SEVERAL VETERANS

01:42:38.552 --> 01:42:39.653
GOING TO GET THOSE TYPE OF

01:42:39.720 --> 01:42:40.621
DEVICES.

01:42:40.687 --> 01:42:41.989
AND BE ABLE TO DO SO MUCH BETTER

01:42:42.055 --> 01:42:43.790
IN THEIR CLASSROOM BUT GETTING

01:42:43.857 --> 01:42:46.126
IN THERE IN ACCESSING THAT IS

01:42:46.193 --> 01:42:47.294
REALLY DIFFICULT.

01:42:47.361 --> 01:42:48.629
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE MENTAL

01:42:48.695 --> 01:42:49.897
HEALTH ISSUES THAT THEY COME IN

01:42:49.963 --> 01:42:52.065
WITH THE VA ALSO MENTIONS THAT

01:42:52.132 --> 01:42:54.635
THE TOP THREE ARE PTSD SYMPTOMS

01:42:54.701 --> 01:42:56.103
POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER?

01:42:56.169 --> 01:42:58.906
DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS AND ALSO IN

01:42:58.972 --> 01:42:59.540
RODDICK.

01:42:59.606 --> 01:43:01.475
THE COLLEGE DATA COMES OUT AND

01:43:01.542 --> 01:43:03.710
SAYS THAT THEY HAVE THE THE MOST

01:43:03.777 --> 01:43:07.447
IMPORTANT IT -- MENTAL HEALTH

01:43:07.514 --> 01:43:08.815
ISSUES ARE AND ZAIDI

01:43:08.882 --> 01:43:09.116
[inaudible]

01:43:09.182 --> 01:43:10.350
DEPRESSION PTSD SYMPTOMS AND

01:43:10.417 --> 01:43:11.752
LONELINESS.

01:43:11.818 --> 01:43:13.186
THEY ALSO SAY THAT THEY HAVE

01:43:13.253 --> 01:43:15.222
DIFFICULTY SLEEPING DIFFICULTY

01:43:15.289 --> 01:43:17.157
CONCENTRATING AND FEELING

01:43:17.224 --> 01:43:18.592
DISTANCE FROM OTHERS BECAUSE

01:43:18.659 --> 01:43:20.494
THEY DON'T ALWAYS KIND OF FEEL

01:43:20.561 --> 01:43:21.628
LIKE THEY'RE PART OF THE GROUP

01:43:21.695 --> 01:43:22.729
WHEN YOU COME IN WITH THE A

01:43:22.796 --> 01:43:24.598
GROUP OF YOUNGER STUDENTS IN THE

01:43:24.665 --> 01:43:26.133
COLLEGE SETTING THERE.

01:43:26.199 --> 01:43:27.534
THEY HAVE DISTURBING MEMORIES

01:43:27.601 --> 01:43:29.069
THEY HAVE THOUGHTS AND THEY HAVE

01:43:29.136 --> 01:43:30.504
THINGS THAT THEY THINK ABOUT IN

01:43:30.571 --> 01:43:32.139
THEIR MILITARY COMBAT EXPERIENCE

01:43:32.205 --> 01:43:33.807
ESPECIALLY THE MORE OFTEN THAT

01:43:33.874 --> 01:43:35.242
THEY WERE DEPLOYED.

01:43:35.309 --> 01:43:36.743
THEY SEEM TO HAVE A LOT MORE

01:43:36.810 --> 01:43:37.978
ISSUES THAT THEY HAVE TO LOOK AT

01:43:38.045 --> 01:43:40.347
WITH MENTAL HEALTH AND ALSO

01:43:40.414 --> 01:43:42.316
MEDICAL ISSUES THERE.

01:43:42.382 --> 01:43:43.850
MILITARY SEXUAL ASSAULT

01:43:43.917 --> 01:43:45.786
ACCORDING TO USA TODAY -- THE

01:43:45.852 --> 01:43:47.087
OTHER DAY WOULD JUST TO STATED

01:43:47.154 --> 01:43:51.124
THAT WE ARE UP SINCE 20001638%

01:43:51.191 --> 01:43:52.960
FROM TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN A

01:43:53.026 --> 01:43:54.394
MILITARY SEXUAL ASSAULTS THOSE

01:43:54.461 --> 01:43:56.396
ISSUES COME BACK TO US IN THE

01:43:56.463 --> 01:43:58.465
COMMUNITY COLLEGE WE'RE LOOKING

01:43:58.532 --> 01:43:59.533
AT THOSE ISSUES ON HOW DO WE

01:43:59.600 --> 01:44:00.801
CARE FOR THOSE.

01:44:00.867 --> 01:44:02.402
THOSE MILITARY COMING BACK WHAT

01:44:02.469 --> 01:44:03.604
DO WE DO.

01:44:03.670 --> 01:44:05.138
IT'S WELL KNOWN IN OUR COMMUNITY

01:44:05.205 --> 01:44:06.206
COLLEGES THAT FEMALES DON'T

01:44:06.273 --> 01:44:07.507
REALLY COME INTO A LOT OF OUR

01:44:07.574 --> 01:44:09.009
VETERAN RESOURCE CENTERS THEY

01:44:09.076 --> 01:44:10.243
DON'T FEEL LIKE THEY'RE A PART

01:44:10.310 --> 01:44:11.278
OF IT SOMETIMES THEY FEEL

01:44:11.345 --> 01:44:12.245
DISTANCE THEY DON'T LIKE THE

01:44:12.312 --> 01:44:13.747
LANGUAGE THEY DON'T LIKE THAT

01:44:13.814 --> 01:44:15.582
KIND OF A BARRACKS TYPE

01:44:15.649 --> 01:44:18.251
SITUATION -- IT'S VERY DIFFICULT

01:44:18.318 --> 01:44:19.519
TO EVEN REACH THOSE FEMALES IS

01:44:19.586 --> 01:44:20.654
DIFFICULT TO REACH A LOT OF

01:44:20.721 --> 01:44:22.589
MILITARY THAT ARE ON CAMPUS IS

01:44:22.656 --> 01:44:23.624
THERE.

01:44:23.690 --> 01:44:25.892
WHAT CAN WE DO TO IMPROVE THESE

01:44:25.959 --> 01:44:27.427
TYPE OF THINGS WHAT CAN WE LOOK

01:44:27.494 --> 01:44:28.729
AT WHEN WE'RE WE'RE?

01:44:28.795 --> 01:44:30.230
LOOKING AT VETERANS IN COLLEGE

01:44:30.297 --> 01:44:32.566
SYSTEMS THE IDEA IS TO KEEP THEM

01:44:32.633 --> 01:44:33.600
THEIR PERSISTENCE AND THEIR

01:44:33.667 --> 01:44:35.702
COMPLETION RATES CONSISTENT WE

01:44:35.769 --> 01:44:38.105
NEED TO MAKE SURE THEY GRADUATE

01:44:38.171 --> 01:44:39.906
TAKING ON I KNOW -- ASSEMBLY

01:44:39.973 --> 01:44:42.109
MEMBER VOCAL MENTIONED ABOUT THE

01:44:42.175 --> 01:44:44.578
CONTINUING ON WITH TWELVE UNITS

01:44:44.645 --> 01:44:46.213
THEY HAVE TO TAKE TWELVE UNITS

01:44:46.279 --> 01:44:47.814
MINIMUM JUST TO GET THEIR VA

01:44:47.881 --> 01:44:49.783
BENEFITS MOST OF THEM TAKE

01:44:49.850 --> 01:44:51.051
FIFTEEN IN EIGHTEEN UNITS IN A

01:44:51.118 --> 01:44:52.452
LOT OF TIMES ARE WORKING PART

01:44:52.519 --> 01:44:53.654
TIME JOBS.

01:44:53.720 --> 01:44:54.821
THEY'RE TRYING TO DO THINGS

01:44:54.888 --> 01:44:56.523
ORANGE COUNTY GIVES A A BASE PAY

01:44:56.590 --> 01:44:57.924
OF LIKE TWENTY SIX HUNDRED

01:44:57.991 --> 01:44:59.259
DOLLARS A MONTH FOR BOARD

01:44:59.326 --> 01:45:00.861
HOUSING SAN FRANCISCO IS UP TO

01:45:00.927 --> 01:45:03.196
ABOUT FORTY THREE TO FORTY FIVE

01:45:03.263 --> 01:45:03.830
HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH BECAUSE

01:45:03.897 --> 01:45:05.032
OF THE COST OF LIVING.

01:45:05.098 --> 01:45:06.266
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT BY THE

01:45:06.333 --> 01:45:07.768
TIME YOU PAY RENT YOU PAY YOUR

01:45:07.834 --> 01:45:09.636
BASIC COST OF LIVING THAT'S ONLY

01:45:09.703 --> 01:45:11.505
REALLY FOR NINE MONTHS BECAUSE

01:45:11.571 --> 01:45:12.906
WE HAVE TO STOP PAY PERIODS

01:45:12.973 --> 01:45:14.474
DURING THE SUMMER THEY DON'T GET

01:45:14.541 --> 01:45:15.842
PAID OR THEY GET HALF PAY?

01:45:15.909 --> 01:45:17.110
AND THEN DURING THE WINTER WHEN

01:45:17.177 --> 01:45:18.679
THEY HAVE ANY TYPE OF BREAK THEY

01:45:18.745 --> 01:45:20.247
DON'T GET FULL PAY THAT MUCH.

01:45:20.313 --> 01:45:21.748
SO YOU HAVE TO ACCOUNT FOR THAT

01:45:21.815 --> 01:45:23.850
IN THERE TOO WHICH CAUSES STRESS

01:45:23.917 --> 01:45:24.751
TO THEM.

01:45:24.818 --> 01:45:25.352
THEY COME OUT WITH FOOD AND

01:45:25.419 --> 01:45:27.721
SECURITY IS VERY LITTLE SUPPORT

01:45:27.788 --> 01:45:29.322
A LOT OF TIMES MOST OF THEM WENT

01:45:29.389 --> 01:45:31.258
INTO THE MILITARY BECAUSE THEY

01:45:31.324 --> 01:45:33.193
WERE LOOKING FOR EIGHT A FAMILY

01:45:33.260 --> 01:45:35.395
A UNIT THEY FOUND THAT IN THERE.

01:45:35.462 --> 01:45:36.329
NOW THEY COME BACK OUT

01:45:36.396 --> 01:45:37.864
ESPECIALLY FEMALES AND THEY HAVE

01:45:37.931 --> 01:45:39.466
NO ONE TO COME OUT TO AND IT

01:45:39.533 --> 01:45:40.901
REALLY MAKES A STRESSFUL YOU'LL

01:45:40.967 --> 01:45:42.602
FIND THAT ON CALIFORNIA IS THE

01:45:42.669 --> 01:45:43.937
LARGEST STATE WITH THE MOST

01:45:44.004 --> 01:45:45.872
VETERANS BECAUSE EVEN WHEN

01:45:45.939 --> 01:45:47.941
THEY'RE COMING FROM THE MIDWEST

01:45:48.008 --> 01:45:48.909
OR ON THE EAST COAST.

01:45:48.975 --> 01:45:50.243
ON A STAIN CALIFORNIA THEY LIKE

01:45:50.310 --> 01:45:51.578
CALIFORNIA WHAT FOR WHATEVER

01:45:51.645 --> 01:45:53.513
REASON I'M SURE IS THE WEATHER

01:45:53.580 --> 01:45:54.715
IN THAT GIRLS AND WHATEVER ELSE

01:45:54.781 --> 01:45:56.383
BUT BUT THEY DO STAY AND THEY

01:45:56.450 --> 01:45:58.118
ENJOY THAT SO SO THAT'S A GOOD

01:45:58.185 --> 01:45:59.820
PART OF IT -- BUT THEY ARE IN

01:45:59.886 --> 01:46:01.288
OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND WE

01:46:01.354 --> 01:46:02.489
ARE THEIR FIRST AVENUE OF

01:46:02.556 --> 01:46:03.824
EDUCATION BECAUSE WE'RE EASY

01:46:03.890 --> 01:46:05.492
ACCESS SO MAKES IT REALLY NICE

01:46:05.559 --> 01:46:06.193
THERE.

01:46:06.259 --> 01:46:07.627
WHAT WE'VE DONE OVER THE LAST

01:46:07.694 --> 01:46:09.930
COUPLE YEARS AS WE HAD FUNDING

01:46:09.996 --> 01:46:10.897
FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ON GOING

01:46:10.964 --> 01:46:13.200
FUNDING THANK YOU ASSEMBLY WOMAN

01:46:13.266 --> 01:46:14.234
IRWIN FOR TAKING THAT CHARGE ON

01:46:14.301 --> 01:46:14.801
THERE?

01:46:14.868 --> 01:46:16.737
WE WERE ABLE TO GET THAT FUNDING

01:46:16.803 --> 01:46:18.338
GOING ON THERE TO SUPPORT SOME

01:46:18.405 --> 01:46:19.906
OF OUR VETERAN RESOURCE CENTERS

01:46:19.973 --> 01:46:21.108
WE NEED MORE SUPPORT MANY

01:46:21.174 --> 01:46:25.679
DEDICATED STAFF WE NEED ACTED

01:46:25.746 --> 01:46:26.880
COUNSELORS TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:46:26.947 --> 01:46:27.481
WHEN THEY COME IN A PUT THEIR

01:46:27.547 --> 01:46:28.381
ACADEMIC PLANS TO GATHER THOSE

01:46:28.448 --> 01:46:30.016
TWELVE UNITS REALLY COUNT. TO

01:46:30.083 --> 01:46:31.118
WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE

01:46:31.184 --> 01:46:32.652
TAKING FOR THAT MAJOR THE BE A

01:46:32.719 --> 01:46:35.322
REQUIRES THAT YOU TAKE SPECIFIC

01:46:35.388 --> 01:46:37.424
MAJORS AND IN THAT WAS MAJORS

01:46:37.491 --> 01:46:38.525
YOU CAN ONLY TAKE SPECIFIC

01:46:38.592 --> 01:46:39.726
CLASSES SO YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE

01:46:39.793 --> 01:46:40.961
ABLE TO TAKE BASKET WEAVING IN

01:46:41.027 --> 01:46:43.563
CERAMICS AND GET THAT APPROVED.

01:46:43.630 --> 01:46:45.031
THEY ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:46:45.098 --> 01:46:47.434
THE MILITARY CREDITS ARE GIVEN

01:46:47.501 --> 01:46:51.404
WE HAVE SUCH A DIVERSE -- RIGHT

01:46:51.471 --> 01:46:52.205
NOW.

01:46:52.272 --> 01:46:53.974
ACCUMULATION OF MILITARY CREDIT

01:46:54.040 --> 01:46:55.442
SOME COLLEGES WILL GIVE FOUR

01:46:55.509 --> 01:46:56.877
UNITS OTHERS WILL GIVE FORTY

01:46:56.943 --> 01:46:59.112
UNITS I STRONGLY FEEL GIVING

01:46:59.179 --> 01:47:00.781
FORTY UNITS TO A A VETERAN

01:47:00.847 --> 01:47:01.715
THERE'S JUST COMING OUT OF THE

01:47:01.782 --> 01:47:02.916
MILITARY THAT'S TRYING TO GET

01:47:02.983 --> 01:47:04.084
THEIR LIFE TOGETHER IN

01:47:04.151 --> 01:47:05.919
ACCLIMATING AND ALL OF THE

01:47:05.986 --> 01:47:07.320
ISSUES THAT I JUST STATED HERE.

01:47:07.387 --> 01:47:08.889
NOT A WISE IDEA BECAUSE WE'RE

01:47:08.955 --> 01:47:10.056
KIND OF SETTING THEM UP FOR

01:47:10.123 --> 01:47:11.124
FAILURE WE NEED TO HELP THEM

01:47:11.191 --> 01:47:13.894
ACCLIMATING GET THEMSELVES GOING

01:47:13.960 --> 01:47:14.995
THERE.

01:47:15.061 --> 01:47:15.529
TO SO AGAIN FUNDING THOSE

01:47:15.595 --> 01:47:16.830
VETERAN RESOURCE CENTERS WHICH

01:47:16.897 --> 01:47:18.765
ARE THE MAIN SOURCE OF THEIR

01:47:18.832 --> 01:47:21.601
SUPPORT -- IN IN THAT MANDATING

01:47:21.668 --> 01:47:23.370
POLICY PROCEDURES AND GUIDELINES

01:47:23.436 --> 01:47:26.006
SO THAT WE HAVE THOSE SUPPORTS

01:47:26.072 --> 01:47:29.142
ON THE VA HAS BEEN A VERY VERY --

01:47:29.209 --> 01:47:31.211
DEVASTATING TYPE OF PROGRAM TO

01:47:31.278 --> 01:47:32.712
WORK WITH FOR ANYBODY COMING OUT

01:47:32.779 --> 01:47:34.915
ONLY 60% OF OUR VETERANS ARE

01:47:34.981 --> 01:47:35.582
ACTUALLY ENROLLED IN BE A HEALTH

01:47:35.649 --> 01:47:36.449
CARE.

01:47:36.516 --> 01:47:37.751
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THEY NEED

01:47:37.818 --> 01:47:39.052
TO BE ENROLLED IN AUTOMATICALLY

01:47:39.119 --> 01:47:40.387
BEFORE THEIR DISCHARGED OFF A

01:47:40.453 --> 01:47:41.254
BASE.

01:47:41.321 --> 01:47:42.556
I TO CONTINUE THEIR PHYSICAL

01:47:42.622 --> 01:47:44.624
THERAPY TO CONTINUE ANYTHING FOR

01:47:44.691 --> 01:47:46.993
BACK SHOULDERS KNEES INJURIES

01:47:47.060 --> 01:47:49.629
ANYTHING LIKE THAT THAT GOES ON

01:47:49.696 --> 01:47:50.564
ESPECIALLY HEARING.

01:47:50.630 --> 01:47:51.731
THEY DON'T HAVE ANY OF THAT

01:47:51.798 --> 01:47:53.466
ACCESS THERE SO THEY COME ONTO

01:47:53.533 --> 01:47:54.668
OUR CAN'T COLLEGE CAMPUSES

01:47:54.734 --> 01:47:55.735
NEEDLESS TO SAY IT'S A

01:47:55.802 --> 01:47:57.137
POPULATION THAT DOESN'T.

01:47:57.204 --> 01:47:58.839
ASK FOR MUCH THE KIND OF LIVE IN

01:47:58.905 --> 01:48:01.107
SILENCE THE PROBLEM IS THOUGH

01:48:01.174 --> 01:48:02.509
THAT LIVING IN THAT SILENCE IS

01:48:02.576 --> 01:48:03.410
THEY SUFFER WITH THEIR OWN

01:48:03.476 --> 01:48:04.744
INSIDE BONES AND THEY'RE NOT

01:48:04.811 --> 01:48:06.813
ABLE TO COMPLETE CLASSES THEY'RE

01:48:06.880 --> 01:48:08.148
NOT ABLE TO USE THEIR BENEFITS

01:48:08.215 --> 01:48:10.083
LIKE THEY SHOULD AND THEY HUESO

01:48:10.150 --> 01:48:10.717
THIRTY SIX MONTHS.

01:48:10.784 --> 01:48:13.019
AND WE NEED TO GET HIM THERE --

01:48:13.086 --> 01:48:14.454
I STRONGLY FEEL THAT AS I SAID

01:48:14.521 --> 01:48:16.189
SUPPLYING THE SUPPORT SYSTEMS

01:48:16.256 --> 01:48:17.958
AND GIVING THAT TO THE COLLEGES

01:48:18.024 --> 01:48:19.693
WOULD MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN

01:48:19.759 --> 01:48:21.962
THIS BOOKLET YOU'LL FIND THAT WE

01:48:22.028 --> 01:48:23.530
HAD -- FINDINGS AND

01:48:23.597 --> 01:48:25.265
RECOMMENDATIONS AND SOME OF THE

01:48:25.332 --> 01:48:27.567
KEY FINDINGS WAR NUMBER ONE WAS

01:48:27.634 --> 01:48:30.403
ON HAT ON MET MENTAL HEALTH

01:48:30.470 --> 01:48:31.938
NEEDS WE NEED TO HAVE A A

01:48:32.005 --> 01:48:33.874
COMPLETE PARTNERSHIP WITH THE VA

01:48:33.940 --> 01:48:35.141
BRINGING MENTAL HELP FOR

01:48:35.208 --> 01:48:36.676
PROVIDERS TO EVERY COLLEGE

01:48:36.743 --> 01:48:38.178
CAMPUS THAT SHOULD BE MANDATED

01:48:38.245 --> 01:48:40.447
THERE'S NO. TWO WAYS ABOUT IT

01:48:40.513 --> 01:48:42.415
COLLEGE STUDENTS IN GENERAL ONE

01:48:42.482 --> 01:48:43.717
IN THREE HAVE A MENTAL HEALTH

01:48:43.783 --> 01:48:45.085
DISORDER.

01:48:45.151 --> 01:48:47.354
THE POINT IS EVERYBODY NEEDS IT

01:48:47.420 --> 01:48:48.755
BUT WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT COMBAT

01:48:48.822 --> 01:48:50.056
WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT MENTAL

01:48:50.123 --> 01:48:51.291
STRESS WERE LOOKING AT THE

01:48:51.358 --> 01:48:53.159
ATROCITIES THAT OUR MILITARY

01:48:53.226 --> 01:48:54.628
HAVE VIEWED AND VISUALIZED AND

01:48:54.694 --> 01:48:56.563
BEEN A PART OF THEY NEED A LOT

01:48:56.630 --> 01:48:57.764
MORE MENTAL HEALTH.

01:48:57.831 --> 01:48:59.065
NUMBER TWO IS ALSO A LACK OF

01:48:59.132 --> 01:49:00.367
UNDERSTANDING OF VETERANS

01:49:00.433 --> 01:49:01.768
STUDENTS UNIQUE CHALLENGES AMONG

01:49:01.835 --> 01:49:04.170
THE V. R. C. STAFF AND FACULTY

01:49:04.237 --> 01:49:06.439
FACULTY ARE SOMETIMES NOT ALWAYS

01:49:06.506 --> 01:49:07.540
AND WE LOVE OUR FACTLY BUT

01:49:07.607 --> 01:49:08.475
SOMETIMES THEY'RE NOT ALWAYS

01:49:08.541 --> 01:49:10.110
UNDERSTANDING WHEN VETERANS NEED

01:49:10.176 --> 01:49:11.011
APPOINTMENTS ARE THEY HAVE

01:49:11.077 --> 01:49:12.312
APPOINTMENTS MADE THERE.

01:49:12.379 --> 01:49:13.513
YOU CAN CANCEL OF THE A

01:49:13.580 --> 01:49:14.447
APPOINTMENT BECAUSE YOU WON'T

01:49:14.514 --> 01:49:16.283
GET IT AGAIN FOR ANOTHER SIX TO

01:49:16.349 --> 01:49:16.950
NINE MONTHS.

01:49:17.017 --> 01:49:18.618
NEED FOR STUDENT FRIENDLY

01:49:18.685 --> 01:49:20.553
BUSINESS HOURS AND SPACES NEED

01:49:20.620 --> 01:49:21.554
FOR INCREASED CAPACITY TO

01:49:21.621 --> 01:49:23.023
SUPPORT VETERANS STUDENTS

01:49:23.089 --> 01:49:24.457
EDUCATIONAL PLANNING AND

01:49:24.524 --> 01:49:25.492
BENEFITS THAT MEANS MORE

01:49:25.558 --> 01:49:26.893
ACADEMIC COUNSELORS THAT ARE

01:49:26.960 --> 01:49:29.462
TRAINED IN THEIR VA BENEFITS.

01:49:29.529 --> 01:49:30.864
NEED FOR STRONGER PARTNERSHIPS

01:49:30.931 --> 01:49:33.300
BETWEEN THE V. A AND THE R. C.'S

01:49:33.366 --> 01:49:34.868
EVEN AND ROLLING THEM IN THE BE

01:49:34.935 --> 01:49:35.835
A HEALTHCARE.

01:49:35.902 --> 01:49:37.904
LACK OF CONSISTENT AND RELIABLE

01:49:37.971 --> 01:49:40.273
DATA ABOUT VETERANS STUDENTS

01:49:40.340 --> 01:49:42.275

WE'VE EVER PRODUCED ON VETERAN

01:49:44.044 --> 01:49:46.146
STUDENTS SO THOSE ARE THE ISSUES

01:49:46.212 --> 01:49:48.415
WERE LOOKING AT AND THAT'S WHAT

01:49:48.481 --> 01:49:50.183
WE STRONGLY SUGGEST AS A TEAM OF

01:49:50.250 --> 01:49:51.484

THE VIETNAM VETERANS OF AMERICA.

01:50:22.315 --> 01:50:23.917
I SPENT FIVE YEARS IN THE UNITED

AFTER MY DISCHARGE FROM THE ARMY

01:50:34.394 --> 01:50:35.528
I REALIZED THAT AS AN

01:50:35.595 --> 01:50:36.763
INFANTRYMAN.

01:50:36.830 --> 01:50:38.131
I DID NOT HAVE MUCH IN THE WAY

01:50:38.198 --> 01:50:39.866
OF TRANSFERABLE SKILLS FROM THE

01:50:39.933 --> 01:50:41.067

01:50:41.134 --> 01:50:43.403
THAT WOULD HELP ME INTEGRATE

01:50:43.470 --> 01:50:44.771
INTO THE WORK FORCE.

01:50:44.838 --> 01:50:45.538
I FACED SOME OF THE SAME

01:50:45.605 --> 01:50:47.540
CHALLENGES AS MANY OTHER SERVICE

01:50:47.607 --> 01:50:48.608

01:50:50.276 --> 01:50:52.579
WHERE TO WORK WHERE TO LIVE?

RENTING OR PURCHASING A HOME

GETTING KIDS TO DAYCARE AND OR

01:50:55.648 --> 01:50:57.784
SCHOOL.

01:50:57.851 --> 01:50:59.152
I WAS MOST CONCERNED.

01:50:59.219 --> 01:51:01.187
WITH PROVIDING FOR MY FAMILY I

01:51:01.254 --> 01:51:02.422
WAS ABLE TO GET A JOB AS A SHEET

METAL APPRENTICE MAKING MINIMUM

01:51:04.124 --> 01:51:04.924
WAGE.

01:51:04.991 --> 01:51:06.192
BECAUSE THE HIGH COST OF LIVING

01:51:06.259 --> 01:51:07.360
IN CALIFORNIA.

01:51:07.427 --> 01:51:08.862
I OFTEN HAD TO RELY ON FAMILY

01:51:08.928 --> 01:51:10.497
AND FRIENDS TO KEEP A ROOF OVER

01:51:10.563 --> 01:51:12.065
MY HEAD.

01:51:12.132 --> 01:51:12.599
MOVING FROM APARTMENT TO

01:51:12.665 --> 01:51:14.534
APARTMENT WAS A STRUGGLE FOR THE

01:51:14.601 --> 01:51:17.871
FIRST FEW YEARS AFTER MY SERVICE.

01:51:17.937 --> 01:51:19.572
I BECAME USED TO LIVING OUT OF A

01:51:20.540 --> 01:51:22.509
AFTER MY TWO TOURS.

01:51:22.575 --> 01:51:25.045
BUT I COULDN'T BEAR MY FAMILY

01:51:25.111 --> 01:51:26.746
LIVING THAT WAY AS WELL.

01:51:26.813 --> 01:51:27.747
EVENTUALLY I LOOKED INTO

01:51:27.814 --> 01:51:29.616
ATTENDING A FOR PROFIT TRADE

01:51:29.682 --> 01:51:33.119
SCHOOL TO ADVANCE MY CAREER.

01:51:33.186 --> 01:51:34.421
I HAD MY OWN USED TO GI BILL

01:51:34.487 --> 01:51:36.423
BENEFITS AND I KNEW I HAD TO USE

01:51:36.489 --> 01:51:38.224
THEM WITHIN FIFTEEN YEARS OF

01:51:38.291 --> 01:51:39.759
MILITARY DISCHARGE.

01:51:39.826 --> 01:51:40.994
DURING MY SEARCH FOR TRADE

01:51:41.061 --> 01:51:42.629
SCHOOL I FOUND THAT I COULD NOT

01:51:42.695 --> 01:51:44.664
EVEN GET INFORMATION.

01:51:44.731 --> 01:51:46.533
FROM THE SCHOOL WITHOUT GIVING

01:51:46.599 --> 01:51:48.268
THEM MY CONTACT INFORMATION.

01:51:48.334 --> 01:51:49.102
THIS RESULTED.

01:51:49.169 --> 01:51:51.771
IN [inaudible]

01:51:51.838 --> 01:51:53.840
RELENTLESS.

01:51:53.907 --> 01:51:54.908
CALLS.

01:51:54.974 --> 01:51:57.043
OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS.

01:51:57.110 --> 01:51:58.545
EVEN FROM SCHOOLS THAT I

01:51:58.611 --> 01:52:00.280
ATTENDED COMPLETED AND GRADUATED

01:52:00.346 --> 01:52:01.748
FROM.

01:52:01.815 --> 01:52:04.350
I SPENT NINE MONTHS IN ABOUT

01:52:04.417 --> 01:52:04.984
TWENTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS TO

BECOME A SERVICE TECHNICIAN.

01:52:13.493 --> 01:52:14.994
BUT IN POINT OPPORTUNITIES

01:52:15.061 --> 01:52:16.262
WITHIN THAT FIELD.

01:52:16.329 --> 01:52:18.398
WERE ALMOST NONEXISTENT.

01:52:18.465 --> 01:52:20.266
I'VE SINCE SEEN OTHER SIMILAR

01:52:20.333 --> 01:52:22.368
PROGRAMS AND I SEE NOW.

01:52:22.435 --> 01:52:23.937
THAT'S THE ONE I WENT THROUGH

01:52:24.003 --> 01:52:25.839
WAS SUB STANDARD.

01:52:25.905 --> 01:52:27.006
I HAVE A CLOSE FRIEND THAT.

01:52:27.073 --> 01:52:28.608
THAT I SERVED WITH ALL FIVE

01:52:28.675 --> 01:52:29.843
YEARS OF MY SERVICE.

01:52:29.909 --> 01:52:31.177
HE'S CURRENTLY GOING THROUGH A

01:52:31.244 --> 01:52:32.779
SIMILAR PROGRAM HERE IN THIS

01:52:32.846 --> 01:52:33.880
AREA.

01:52:33.947 --> 01:52:35.181
SIMPLY BECAUSE HE NEEDS THE

01:52:35.248 --> 01:52:36.649
ADDITIONAL INCOME FROM THE GI

01:52:36.716 --> 01:52:39.152
BILL AS HE WORKS FULL TIME.

01:52:39.219 --> 01:52:41.287
BUT HE IS NOT SATISFIED WITH THE

01:52:41.354 --> 01:52:44.224
EDUCATION THAT HE IS RECEIVING.

01:52:44.290 --> 01:52:45.892
LATER I ATTENDED YET ANOTHER

01:52:45.959 --> 01:52:49.129
[inaudible] FOR PROFIT.

01:52:49.195 --> 01:52:50.797

LEAD TO A RELIABLE EMPLOYMENT.

01:52:56.302 --> 01:52:58.838
AGAIN OPPORTUNITIES WERE FEW.

01:52:58.905 --> 01:53:00.306
MAKING SURE THAT THE SCHOOLS ARE

01:53:00.373 --> 01:53:02.809
HERE TO STANDARDS IS VITAL.

01:53:02.876 --> 01:53:04.844
IS A VITAL PART OF PROTECTING

01:53:04.911 --> 01:53:07.947
THE GI BILL FOR VETERANS LIKE ME.

01:53:08.014 --> 01:53:09.849
WHY THE GI BILL SUCH IMPORTANT

01:53:09.916 --> 01:53:11.017
BENEFIT?

01:53:11.084 --> 01:53:13.786
FIRST IT ALLOWS VETERANS LIKE ME.

01:53:13.853 --> 01:53:15.421
TO THAT LIST RIGHT AFTER HIGH

01:53:15.488 --> 01:53:17.857
SCHOOL TO COME HOME TO PURSUE A

PROVIDES YOU WITH SOME INCOME

01:53:21.961 --> 01:53:23.563
WHICH HELPS WITH THE

01:53:23.630 --> 01:53:25.131
COMPLICATIONS OF WORKING WHILE

01:53:25.198 --> 01:53:26.366
ATTENDING SCHOOL.

01:53:26.432 --> 01:53:27.634
AS IT TURNS OUT I HAD TO WORK

01:53:27.700 --> 01:53:29.802
FULL TIME IN ADDITION TO

01:53:29.869 --> 01:53:31.104
ATTENDING SCHOOL FULL TIME.

01:53:31.171 --> 01:53:33.106
THE GI BILL.

01:53:33.173 --> 01:53:34.908
CAN CHANGE VETERANS LIFE

01:53:34.974 --> 01:53:37.277
EDUCATION IS EMPOWERMENT.

01:53:37.343 --> 01:53:38.178
WASTE IN THIS BETTER BENEFIT IS

01:53:38.244 --> 01:53:39.612
A TRAGEDY.

01:53:39.679 --> 01:53:40.947
AFTER A MORE PROGRAMS TO

01:53:41.014 --> 01:53:42.682
TRANSITION VETERAN STRAIGHT INTO

01:53:42.749 --> 01:53:44.184
THE WORK FORCE WHAT THE NEW

01:53:44.250 --> 01:53:46.019
FOREVER GI BILL VETERANS WOULD

01:53:46.085 --> 01:53:47.086
BE ABLE TO SAVE THEIR COLLEGE

01:53:47.153 --> 01:53:48.588
BENEFIT OR PASS THEM ON TO THEIR

01:53:48.655 --> 01:53:49.355
CHILDREN.

01:53:49.422 --> 01:53:51.357
THIS WOULD INCREASE THE ECONOMIC

01:53:51.424 --> 01:53:54.093
OUTPUT FOR VETERANS. FOR OUR

01:53:54.160 --> 01:53:54.594

01:53:57.764 --> 01:53:59.065
CALIFORNIA ECONOMY.

01:53:59.132 --> 01:54:00.433
THE ALTERNATIVE IS UNEMPLOYMENT

01:54:00.500 --> 01:54:03.536
AND STUDENT AT IN CONCLUSION OUR

01:54:03.603 --> 01:54:05.138
CLIENTS AND I WOULD LIKE TO

01:54:05.205 --> 01:54:07.173
STRESS THE NEED. TO PROTECT THE

VIABILITY OF THE GI BILL

01:54:08.875 --> 01:54:10.009
BENEFITS.

01:54:10.076 --> 01:54:11.077
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT

COLLEGES ARE NOT TAKING

01:54:13.079 --> 01:54:14.914
ADVANTAGE OF THE VETERANS THAT

01:54:14.981 --> 01:54:16.282
DESERVE THIS BENEFIT.

01:54:16.349 --> 01:54:18.017
MANY ON VETERANS RETURN HOME AND

01:54:18.084 --> 01:54:20.453
ARE CONFUSED ON WHAT COURSE THEY

01:54:20.520 --> 01:54:21.955
SHOULD PERFECT.

01:54:22.021 --> 01:54:23.690
PURSUE.

01:54:23.756 --> 01:54:25.124
IN THEIR POST MILITARY LIFE.

01:54:25.191 --> 01:54:27.227
UNSCRUPULOUS MARKETING TACTICS

01:54:27.293 --> 01:54:29.629
AND SUB STANDARD CURRICULUM.

01:54:29.696 --> 01:54:31.030
CHEATS THE VETERANS ARE THE

01:54:31.097 --> 01:54:32.699
BENEFITS THEY'VE EARNED BY

01:54:32.765 --> 01:54:34.367
VIRTUE OF THEIR SERVICE.

01:54:34.434 --> 01:54:35.868
THE BILL WHOSE CALIFORNIA TO

01:54:35.935 --> 01:54:37.437
ENCOURAGE THE PROPER USE OF THE

01:54:37.503 --> 01:54:38.571
GI BILL BENEFITS.

01:54:38.638 --> 01:54:39.973
THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS

01:54:40.039 --> 01:54:42.041
OF DOLLARS AND FEDERAL MONIES

01:54:42.108 --> 01:54:43.643
COMING TO THE STATE FOR THE

01:54:43.710 --> 01:54:45.144
BENEFIT OF TRAINING OUR VETERANS

01:54:45.211 --> 01:54:47.647
TO FULLY PARTICIPATE IN SOCIETY.

01:54:47.714 --> 01:54:49.515
THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME LEVEL

01:54:49.582 --> 01:54:50.550
OVERSIGHT.

01:54:50.617 --> 01:54:52.218
OVER FOR PROFIT TRADE SCHOOLS

01:54:52.285 --> 01:54:54.153
AND COLLEGES TO ENSURE THAT THEY

01:54:54.220 --> 01:54:56.789
ARE PROVIDING THE ACTUAL.

01:54:56.856 --> 01:54:58.324
PRODUCT THEY THAT THEIR

01:55:14.574 --> 01:55:15.541
SHARING.

01:55:15.608 --> 01:55:17.110
YOUR PERSONAL EXPERIENCES I

01:55:17.176 --> 01:55:19.445
THINK THAT REALLY HITS HOME AS

01:55:19.512 --> 01:55:21.547
TO WHY WE HAVE TO LOOK MORE

01:55:21.614 --> 01:55:24.517
CLOSELY AT THIS PROBLEM DO YOU

01:55:24.584 --> 01:55:27.186
STILL HAVE STUDENT LOANS.

01:55:27.253 --> 01:55:28.888
GOOD FOR YOU AFTER.

01:55:28.955 --> 01:55:30.123
GOING THROUGH ALL THAT.

01:55:30.189 --> 01:55:34.661
OF I GUESS THIS IS OF HER MS

01:55:34.727 --> 01:55:35.295
MONTGOMERY -- IT.

01:55:35.361 --> 01:55:36.162
YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE TALKING A

01:55:36.229 --> 01:55:38.865
LOT ABOUT HOW DO WE SEE WHAT THE

01:55:38.931 --> 01:55:41.534
EFFECTIVENESS IS OF A EDUCATION

01:55:41.601 --> 01:55:44.837
DO YOU THINK IT'S A DIFFICULT TO

01:55:44.904 --> 01:55:47.373
EVALUATE CLAIMS ABOUT A SCHOOL --

01:55:47.440 --> 01:55:51.311
WITH THAT THE SCHOOL PROGRAMS

01:55:51.377 --> 01:55:52.545
LIABILITY IN THE MARKET.

01:55:52.612 --> 01:55:54.247
YES I THINK IT'S VERY DIFFICULT

01:55:54.314 --> 01:55:55.715
WE'VE HAD A LOT OF STUDENTS COME

01:55:55.782 --> 01:55:56.983
TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE ASKED

01:55:57.050 --> 01:55:58.418
AFTER THEY'VE WASTED A LOT OF

01:55:58.484 --> 01:55:59.919
BENEFITS IF NOT ALL OF THEIR

01:55:59.986 --> 01:56:02.388
BENEFITS AT A FOR PROFIT.

01:56:02.455 --> 01:56:03.690
AND I THINK IT'S VERY DIFFICULT

01:56:03.756 --> 01:56:05.892
IT'S ALSO VERY DIFFICULT ON THE

01:56:05.958 --> 01:56:08.561
VETERAN AS HE SO WELL STATED IS

01:56:08.628 --> 01:56:10.663
THAT -- WHEN THEY COME IN THEY

01:56:10.730 --> 01:56:13.132
THEY ALSO FACE ANOTHER KIND OF --

01:56:13.199 --> 01:56:15.868
FEELING OF DISGRUNTLED AND ALSO

01:56:15.935 --> 01:56:17.770
FEELING OF I GOTTA START THIS

01:56:17.837 --> 01:56:19.339
ALL OVER AGAIN IT'S A VERY

01:56:19.405 --> 01:56:20.640
DISHEARTENING TO SEE A VETERAN

01:56:20.707 --> 01:56:22.075
COME IN AFTER THEY'VE TRIED SO

01:56:22.141 --> 01:56:22.875
HARD.

01:56:22.942 --> 01:56:24.877
AND THEY'VE LOST A MAJORITY OF

01:56:24.944 --> 01:56:26.412
THEIR BENEFITS AS OR THEY HAVE

01:56:26.479 --> 01:56:28.748
GONE FINANCIAL AID OR TAKE OUT

01:56:28.815 --> 01:56:29.916
LOANS TO TO COMPLETE THEIR

01:56:29.982 --> 01:56:31.918
EDUCATION AND THEY TRIED TO DO

01:56:31.984 --> 01:56:33.453
THAT AND WE'VE HAD SEVERAL OF

01:56:33.519 --> 01:56:36.522
THEM DO THAT AT MY LAST COLLEGES

01:56:36.589 --> 01:56:37.990
REDUCE AND IT COMING TO IRVINE.

01:56:38.057 --> 01:56:38.624
BUT AND WHAT ABOUT THE STUDENTS

01:56:38.691 --> 01:56:40.827
THAT ARE -- EITHER GRADUATING

01:56:40.893 --> 01:56:42.161
FROM THE AND TWO YEARS OF

01:56:42.228 --> 01:56:43.496
COLLEGE AND THEN GOING ON TO A

01:56:43.563 --> 01:56:47.200
FOUR YEAR PROGRAM YOU FOLLOWING

01:56:47.266 --> 01:56:48.835
ANY OF THEM SEE WHAT THEY'RE AND

01:56:48.901 --> 01:56:49.936
AND HERE'S THE PROBLEM WITH THAT.

01:56:50.002 --> 01:56:52.572
IS THAT BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A

01:56:52.638 --> 01:56:54.674
SET GUIDELINE A STANDARD OF

01:56:54.741 --> 01:56:56.576
PRACTICE SO TO SPEAK IN ALL

01:56:56.642 --> 01:56:58.010
COMMUNITY COLLEGES BE VETERAN

01:56:58.077 --> 01:57:00.012
RESOURCE CENTERS ONLY A FEW OF

01:57:00.079 --> 01:57:01.814
US MAYBE A HANDFUL OUT OF THAT

01:57:01.881 --> 01:57:03.216
HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN ACTUALLY

01:57:03.282 --> 01:57:04.350
ARE ABLE TO FOLLOW THEIR

01:57:04.417 --> 01:57:05.451
STUDENTS FIND OUT WHERE THEY'RE

01:57:05.518 --> 01:57:06.185
GOING TO LOOK.

01:57:06.252 --> 01:57:06.986
AT THEIR COMPLETION THEIR

01:57:07.053 --> 01:57:08.588
PERSISTENCE RATES FIND OUT WHO'S

01:57:08.654 --> 01:57:10.223
DROPPING OUT WHO TO DO THE

01:57:10.289 --> 01:57:11.657
RESEARCH ON WHAT'S GOING ON

01:57:11.724 --> 01:57:13.192
THERE'S NOT A LOT OF INDIVIDUALS

01:57:13.259 --> 01:57:14.060
BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE

01:57:14.127 --> 01:57:15.027
COORDINATORS THEY DON'T HAVE

01:57:15.094 --> 01:57:16.195
STAFF AND THEIR MAYBE THEIR

01:57:16.262 --> 01:57:18.030
ACADEMIC COUNSELORS 25% OF THE

01:57:18.097 --> 01:57:19.098
TIME.

01:57:19.165 --> 01:57:21.534
OUR COLLEGE DOES FOLLOW THAT WE

01:57:21.601 --> 01:57:22.502
HAVE TO ACTUALLY THEY'RE JUST

01:57:22.568 --> 01:57:24.303
INTERVIEWED AT YALE WE HAD ONE

01:57:24.370 --> 01:57:25.638
THAT WENT TO STANFORD LAST YEAR

01:57:25.705 --> 01:57:27.607
WHICH IS HIGHLY HARD TO GET INTO

01:57:27.673 --> 01:57:29.075
WHEN YOU'RE TRANSFERRING IN AND

01:57:29.142 --> 01:57:30.510
FOUR YEAR LIKE THAT. ONE IS

01:57:30.576 --> 01:57:31.611
GOING AGAIN TO STAND FOR THIS

01:57:31.677 --> 01:57:33.179
YEAR THEY GO TO UNIVERSITY

01:57:33.246 --> 01:57:35.515
KENTUCKY WE HAD WE FOLLOW ALL OF

01:57:35.581 --> 01:57:37.049
THEM DOWN THE LINE WE FIND OUT

01:57:37.116 --> 01:57:38.151
WHERE THEY'RE GOING BECAUSE

01:57:38.217 --> 01:57:40.052
NEEDLESS TO SAY OUR ACADEMIC

01:57:40.119 --> 01:57:41.020
COUNSELOR RIGHTS THEIR LETTERS

01:57:41.087 --> 01:57:42.488
OF RECOMMENDATION AND THEN WE

01:57:42.555 --> 01:57:44.424
ARE ABLE TO FIND OUT WE HAVE.

01:57:44.490 --> 01:57:45.792
THIRTY TWO GRADUATING RIGHT

01:57:45.858 --> 01:57:47.260
TODAY WE'RE HAVING A GRADUATION

01:57:47.326 --> 01:57:48.961
PARTY WITH TALK OF MAN AT OUR

01:57:49.028 --> 01:57:53.466
COLLEGE -- AND SO THEY ARE.

01:57:53.533 --> 01:57:54.233
WE HAVE THE LIST OF THOSE NAMES

01:57:54.300 --> 01:57:55.735
AND WE KNOW EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING

01:57:55.802 --> 01:57:57.537
ON WITH THAT OTHER COLLEGES ARE

01:57:57.603 --> 01:57:59.338
NOT ABLE TO DO THAT BUT THAT

01:57:59.405 --> 01:58:01.808
SHOULD BE A STANDARD OF PRACTICE.

01:58:01.874 --> 01:58:03.376
SO -- I'M I'M WE KNOW IRVINE

01:58:03.443 --> 01:58:05.011
VALLEY IS A MODEL IF YOU LOOK AT

01:58:05.077 --> 01:58:06.913
THE OTHER COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND

01:58:06.979 --> 01:58:08.614
CALIFORNIA DO YOU THINK THAT

01:58:08.681 --> 01:58:09.916
THEY ARE OFFERING ENOUGH

01:58:09.982 --> 01:58:12.251
PROGRAMS OR CLASSES TO HELP

01:58:12.318 --> 01:58:15.855
VETERANS SIDE TRANSITION.

01:58:15.922 --> 01:58:16.489
SOME WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING AT I

01:58:16.556 --> 01:58:19.025
THINK THE PROBLEM THERE IS THAT.

01:58:19.091 --> 01:58:20.026
THEY DON'T HAVE THE SUPPORT

01:58:20.092 --> 01:58:22.995
SERVICES NOW SO TRANSITIONING NO.

01:58:23.062 --> 01:58:24.897
BUT THE COURSES HAVE TO BE THEY

01:58:24.964 --> 01:58:26.432
ALMOST NEED A CAREER ASSESSMENT

01:58:26.499 --> 01:58:27.900
BEFORE THEY LEAVE BASE TO FIND

01:58:27.967 --> 01:58:29.769
OUT WHAT THEY WANT TO DO.

01:58:29.836 --> 01:58:31.504
MY CONCERN IS THAT I HAVE.

01:58:31.571 --> 01:58:33.339
AN ELECTRICAL STE -- STUDENT

01:58:33.406 --> 01:58:35.708
COMES IN WITH A VAST AMOUNT OF

01:58:35.775 --> 01:58:37.276
ELECTRICAL EXPERIENCE THAT HE

01:58:37.343 --> 01:58:39.445
WAS TRAINED IN THE MARINE CORPS

01:58:39.512 --> 01:58:40.980
THERE HE COMES OUT NEEDS I HE'S

01:58:41.047 --> 01:58:42.582
WALKING OUT OF THE CENTER WITH

01:58:42.648 --> 01:58:43.616
ME AT MY LAST COLLEGE AND I SAID

01:58:43.683 --> 01:58:44.851
SO HOW ARE YOUR CLASSES DOING HE

01:58:44.917 --> 01:58:45.651
SAYS TO ME.

01:58:45.718 --> 01:58:47.019
WELL I'M FEELING EVERY CLASS I

01:58:47.086 --> 01:58:48.988
SAID WHOA LET'S STOP I SEE WHAT

01:58:49.055 --> 01:58:49.922
YOU MEAN YOU'RE FEELING EVERY

01:58:49.989 --> 01:58:51.224
CLASS HE SAYS YEAH I DON'T WANT

01:58:51.290 --> 01:58:53.626
TO BE HERE I WANT TO BE AN

01:58:53.693 --> 01:58:54.694
ELECTOR XIN NOBODY EVER ASKED ME.

01:58:54.760 --> 01:58:56.095
SO WHAT I WALKED HIM BACK IN AND

01:58:56.162 --> 01:58:57.663
I SAID FIND AN ELECTRICAL

01:58:57.730 --> 01:58:59.332
COLLEGE FOR HIM TO GO TO NOW HE

01:58:59.398 --> 01:59:00.566
ENDED UP TRANSFERRING TO PALOMAR

01:59:00.633 --> 01:59:02.935
BECAUSE THEY HAVE THAT TYPE OF

01:59:03.002 --> 01:59:03.703
PROGRAM THERE.

01:59:03.769 --> 01:59:04.937
SO EVERY COLLEGE IS DIFFERENT

01:59:05.004 --> 01:59:07.206
BECAUSE OF THE TYPE OF PROGRAMS

01:59:07.273 --> 01:59:08.508
THAT THEY OFFER SOME OFFER

01:59:08.574 --> 01:59:10.643
NURSING PROGRAMS WE HAVE SO MANY

01:59:10.710 --> 01:59:12.645
MEDICS AND CORPSMAN COMING OUT --

01:59:12.712 --> 01:59:14.313
WITH MILITARY CREDITS THAT THEY

01:59:14.380 --> 01:59:15.915
SHOULD BE GIVEN FOR WHAT THEY'VE

01:59:15.982 --> 01:59:18.284
LEARNED ALSO IN THE MILITARY TO

01:59:18.351 --> 01:59:19.919
AND THAT'S A WHOLE NOTHER TOPIC

01:59:19.986 --> 01:59:21.354
THERE BUT BUT I THINK THAT IT'S

01:59:21.420 --> 01:59:23.222
IMPORTANT THAT WE CAREER ASSESS

01:59:23.289 --> 01:59:25.024
FIND OUT WHERE THEY'RE GOING IF

01:59:25.091 --> 01:59:26.592
THEY DON'T KNOW THAT WE NEED TO

01:59:26.659 --> 01:59:27.026
HELP THEM FIGURE.

01:59:27.093 --> 01:59:28.261
THAT OUT AND KIND OF WITH SOME

01:59:28.327 --> 01:59:30.329
TYPE OF TESTING OR SOME TYPE OF

01:59:30.396 --> 01:59:32.131
ACADEMIC PROGRAMS THAT THEY CAN

01:59:32.198 --> 01:59:34.534
TAKEN FIGURED OUT WITHIN THE

01:59:34.600 --> 01:59:37.003
FIRST SEMESTER.

01:59:37.069 --> 01:59:38.037
YEAH WE NEED A FEW MORE OF YOU.

01:59:38.104 --> 01:59:39.472
TO YEAH THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL SO

01:59:39.539 --> 01:59:41.140
WHAT DO YOU THINK THE BIGGEST --

01:59:41.207 --> 01:59:43.042
CHALLENGES THAT VETERANS FACE

01:59:43.109 --> 01:59:46.479
ENTERING THE CIVILIAN JOB MARKET.

01:59:46.546 --> 01:59:48.414
AND WHAT ALLEN DO YOU -- PREPARE

01:59:48.481 --> 01:59:50.316
THEM FOR THAT AS THROUGH THE

01:59:50.383 --> 01:59:52.752
PROGRAM THAT -- YOUR COLLEGE

01:59:52.818 --> 01:59:53.653
THEY NEED SOME TYPE OF

01:59:53.719 --> 01:59:54.921
INTERNSHIP.

01:59:54.987 --> 01:59:56.889
I THINK OUR WORKFORCE INVESTMENT

01:59:56.956 --> 01:59:58.758
MONEY SHOULD BE UTILIZED A LOT

01:59:58.824 --> 02:00:01.327
MORE EFFICIENTLY WITH VETERANS I

02:00:01.394 --> 02:00:02.194
BELIEVE THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE A

02:00:02.261 --> 02:00:04.931
LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES TO INTERNET

02:00:04.997 --> 02:00:06.432
DIFFERENT BIG COMPANIES THAT.

02:00:06.499 --> 02:00:07.833
AT EVENTHERE'S IN IRVINE

02:00:07.900 --> 02:00:09.468
THERE'S TACO BELL THERE'S

02:00:09.535 --> 02:00:10.369
EIGHTEEN T. ALL OF THEIR YOU

02:00:10.436 --> 02:00:11.737
KNOW THEIR BIG SATELLITE

02:00:11.804 --> 02:00:12.939
COMPANIES THERE THEY SHOULD BE

02:00:13.005 --> 02:00:14.040
ABLE TO IN TURN IN THERE AND

02:00:14.106 --> 02:00:15.841
FIND OUT WHAT THEY REALLY WANT

02:00:15.908 --> 02:00:17.143
TO DO SEE IF THAT'S WHAT THEY

02:00:17.209 --> 02:00:18.044
WANTED.

02:00:18.110 --> 02:00:19.111
TO FIND OUT GO TO SOME OF THE

02:00:19.178 --> 02:00:20.580
ELECTRICAL UNIONS THE PLUMBING

02:00:20.646 --> 02:00:22.782
PIPE BANNERS AND AND GET SOME

02:00:22.848 --> 02:00:23.783
TYPE OF IF I HAVE OF THAT FROM

COMING OUT THAT HAS BEEN. FOUR

02:00:25.484 --> 02:00:27.019
YEARS EXPERIENCE IN ELECTRICAL

SAY THIS THAT IF FIVE WAS A

02:04:22.354 --> 02:04:25.391
RETURNING -- VETERANS -- LOOKING

02:04:25.457 --> 02:04:29.461
TO USE MY GI BILL I'D WANT TO BE

02:04:29.528 --> 02:04:31.730
IT IRVINE VALLEY.

02:04:31.797 --> 02:04:33.566
AND AND I THINK I WOULD GET MY

02:04:33.632 --> 02:04:36.435
MONEY'S WORTH THEIR SO -- MY

02:04:36.502 --> 02:04:40.806
QUESTION. TO YOU DEMON JR MARIE.

02:04:40.873 --> 02:04:43.442
DO YOU FIND THAT THE AIR FORCE

02:04:43.509 --> 02:04:46.145
THE AIR FORCE -- THEY OFFER A

02:04:46.212 --> 02:04:48.614
COMMUNITY COLLEGE TRANSCRIPT IS

02:04:48.681 --> 02:04:50.549
IS THAT CORRECT YEAH.

02:04:50.616 --> 02:04:53.485
AND IS THAT -- IS THAT HELPFUL --

02:04:53.552 --> 02:04:55.955
AT AT YOUR INSTITUTION -- THAT

02:04:56.021 --> 02:04:58.557
IS RIGHT RIGHT IF THE OTHER

02:04:58.624 --> 02:04:59.458
BRANCHES OF THE MILITARY.

02:04:59.525 --> 02:05:00.993
THEY DON'T OFFER THE SAME THING

02:05:01.060 --> 02:05:01.961
AND IF THEY DID WOULD THAT BE

02:05:02.027 --> 02:05:03.329
HELPFUL I THINK ALL OF THE

02:05:03.395 --> 02:05:04.663
TRANSCRIPTS ARE DIFFICULT TO

02:05:04.730 --> 02:05:05.831
DECIPHER.

02:05:05.898 --> 02:05:07.733
AND WHAT HAPPENS IS MY COLLEGE

02:05:07.800 --> 02:05:09.735
CAN OFFER A THREE UNIT ENGLISH

02:05:09.802 --> 02:05:10.836
COURSE WHICH CAN BE DIFFERENT

02:05:10.903 --> 02:05:12.271
THEN MY SISTER COLLEGE YOU CAN

02:05:12.338 --> 02:05:14.406
ALSO BE DIFFERENT THAN ANY OTHER

02:05:14.473 --> 02:05:15.441
COLLEGE IN THE SYSTEM.

02:05:15.507 --> 02:05:17.176
THERE FOR THE SAME THING HAPPENS

02:05:17.243 --> 02:05:18.344
WHEN YOU GET THOSE JOINT SERVICE

02:05:18.410 --> 02:05:19.511
TRANSCRIPT.

02:05:19.578 --> 02:05:20.980
THEY'RE ALL DIFFERENT SO THEY

02:05:21.046 --> 02:05:22.514
MAY ONLY GIVE TWO UNITS WE

02:05:22.581 --> 02:05:24.516
REQUIRE THREE UNITS TO TRANSFER

02:05:24.583 --> 02:05:25.651
SO THEREFORE THEY HAVE TO TAKE

02:05:25.718 --> 02:05:26.619
THE WHOLE.

02:05:26.685 --> 02:05:28.354
THE WHOLE COURSE OVER AGAIN SO

02:05:28.420 --> 02:05:30.456
SOMETIMES THEY'RE NOT THAT EASY

02:05:30.522 --> 02:05:32.825
TO TRANSFER OVER -- THAT'S WHY I

02:05:32.892 --> 02:05:34.360
STRONGLY FEEL THAT WE SHOULD GO

02:05:34.426 --> 02:05:35.728
TO SOME TYPE OF COMPETENCY

02:05:35.794 --> 02:05:37.730
TESTING WHEN THEY LOOK AT ANY

02:05:37.796 --> 02:05:41.300
TYPE OF A LEARNED ABILITIES THAT

02:05:41.367 --> 02:05:42.134
THEY'VE DONE OR ANY TYPE OF

02:05:42.201 --> 02:05:44.103
COLLEGE CREDIT THAT IS IN ANY

02:05:44.169 --> 02:05:45.704
MILITARY BRANCH I THINK THAT

02:05:45.771 --> 02:05:48.073
THAT'S IT'S IT'S RESPECTING WHAT

02:05:48.140 --> 02:05:48.641
THEY'VE LEARNED.

02:05:48.707 --> 02:05:49.808
IT'S ALSO NOT BASING THEIR

02:05:49.875 --> 02:05:51.911
KNOWLEDGE ON ON WHAT THEY CAN

02:05:51.977 --> 02:05:54.179
ACTUALLY COMPLETE AND DO AS THIS

02:05:54.246 --> 02:05:56.448
GENTLEMAN SAID WHEN YOU LOOK AT

02:05:56.515 --> 02:05:58.384
EVEN NURSING I LEARNED MORE ON

02:05:58.450 --> 02:06:00.986
HANDS THAN I EVER DID IN MY

02:06:01.053 --> 02:06:02.154
NURSING COURSES I LEARNED ALL

02:06:02.221 --> 02:06:04.323
THE BASIC THINGS BUT MY ON HANDS

02:06:04.390 --> 02:06:05.591
TRAINING TAUGHT ME.

02:06:05.658 --> 02:06:07.159
EVERYTHING AND I TAUGHT NURSING

02:06:07.226 --> 02:06:10.029
BUT THERE'S NO REASON FOR ME TO

02:06:10.095 --> 02:06:11.230
PUT.

02:06:11.297 --> 02:06:12.398
A MEDIC OR CORPSMAN IN THAT

02:06:12.464 --> 02:06:13.933
WHOLE FIRST SEMESTER OF NURSING

02:06:13.999 --> 02:06:14.900
SCHOOL WHEN THEY'RE GONNA LEARN

02:06:14.967 --> 02:06:16.335
HOW TO MAKE A BED AND PUT IN A

02:06:16.402 --> 02:06:17.269
CATHETER.

02:06:17.336 --> 02:06:18.904
BECAUSE THEY'VE ALREADY DONE

02:06:18.971 --> 02:06:19.972
FIVE MILLION OTHER THINGS

02:06:20.039 --> 02:06:22.041
TRAIPSING YOU KNOW SO DO PEOPLE

02:06:22.107 --> 02:06:22.641

02:06:22.708 --> 02:06:24.076
LINES AND DONE FIVE MILLION

02:06:24.143 --> 02:06:24.977
OTHER THINGS.

02:06:25.044 --> 02:06:27.012
I THINK THAT WE NEED TO ANALYZE

02:06:27.079 --> 02:06:29.581
WHAT THOSE ARE AND MAYBE GIVE

02:06:29.648 --> 02:06:31.517
THEM CREDIT FOR TAKING THE

02:06:31.583 --> 02:06:33.152
COURSES IF THEY JUST PASS AN

02:06:33.218 --> 02:06:34.553
EXAM OR THEY CAN MEET THE

02:06:34.620 --> 02:06:36.588
REQUIREMENT OF THAT EXAM SO.

02:06:36.655 --> 02:06:37.756

02:06:37.823 --> 02:06:40.459
