CALIFORNIA. ONE CONSEQUENCE IS

00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.593
THE WILDFIRES WHICH ARE MORE

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:48.161

00:03:48.227 --> 00:03:50.129
DESTRUCTIVE.

00:03:50.196 --> 00:03:51.664
IN MANY INSTANCES UTILITIES OF

00:03:51.731 --> 00:03:53.666
FAILED TO MAINTAIN THEIR

00:03:53.733 --> 00:03:55.702

EVEN IF THEY DID NOTHING WRONG.

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:07.947
THESE TWO FACTORS THOUGH HAVE

00:04:08.014 --> 00:04:10.450
BECAUSE THE BOND RATING AGENCIES

00:04:10.516 --> 00:04:13.987

COSTS FOR THE UTILITIES.

00:04:34.741 --> 00:04:36.442
WHEN THEY BORROW AS MAJOR

BUSINESSES DO?

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.245
THOSE INCREASED COSTS WILL

00:04:39.312 --> 00:04:40.947
INCREASE CUSTOMERS COSTS BY

NOT TO OPERATE AT ALL AND GO

00:04:47.987 --> 00:04:49.555

00:13:39.952 --> 00:13:42.054
INSURANCE FUND -- THE INSURANCE

00:13:42.121 --> 00:13:43.889
FUND WOULD BE CAPITALIZE FROM

00:13:43.956 --> 00:13:45.090
TWO MAIN SOURCES IT WOULD BE

00:13:45.157 --> 00:13:47.059
CAPITALIZE FROM TE TEN AND A

00:13:47.126 --> 00:13:48.360
HALF BILLION DOLLARS IN.

00:13:48.427 --> 00:13:50.663
CONTRIBUTIONS FROM UTILITIES

00:13:50.729 --> 00:13:52.431
THAT AS MR MAYES -- RAISED WOULD

00:13:52.498 --> 00:13:53.532
NOT BE RECOVERABLE FROM

00:13:53.599 --> 00:13:55.434
RATEPAYERS IT WOULD ALSO BE

00:13:55.501 --> 00:13:57.136
CAPITALIZED BY AN EXTENSION OF

00:13:57.203 --> 00:13:59.572
EXISTING -- CHARGES THAT ARE --

00:13:59.638 --> 00:14:03.008
THAT REPAIRS ARE PAYING -- SO IT

00:14:03.075 --> 00:14:03.642
WOULD BE AN EXTENSION OF THE D.

00:14:03.709 --> 00:14:05.878
W. OR RATE CHARGE -- FOR UP TO

00:14:05.945 --> 00:14:07.913
TEN YEARS SO THOSE WOULD BE THE

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:09.215
TWO PRIMARY.

00:14:09.281 --> 00:14:10.549
SOURCES OF FUNDING FOR A CLAIM

00:14:10.616 --> 00:14:13.652
SPAIN RESOURCES THAT WOULD BE.

00:14:13.719 --> 00:14:15.421
SUPPLEMENTED -- OR THEY WOULD

00:14:15.487 --> 00:14:17.256
TURN INTO YOU KNOW FROM TWENTY

00:14:17.323 --> 00:14:18.691
ONE BILLION TWO UP TO FORTY

00:14:18.757 --> 00:14:19.892
BILLION DOLLARS OF CLAIM SPAIN

00:14:19.959 --> 00:14:21.126
RESOURCES.

00:14:21.193 --> 00:14:23.095
THAT BECOMES -- POSSIBLE BECAUSE

00:14:23.162 --> 00:14:24.797
IT WILL ALSO BE AN ELEMENT THAT

00:14:24.863 --> 00:14:27.666
WOULD PROVIDE FOR A 40%.

00:14:27.733 --> 00:14:30.269
LIMITATION ON THAT --

00:14:30.336 --> 00:14:33.172
GENERALISES 40% BUT IT COULD BE

00:14:33.239 --> 00:14:34.073
INCREASE OF THE MINISTER DECIDES

00:14:34.139 --> 00:14:35.541
NET IS NECESSARY IN TERMS OF

00:14:35.608 --> 00:14:36.675
REIMBURSEMENTS TO INSURANCE

00:14:36.742 --> 00:14:39.378
COMPANY FOR SO BEFORE

00:14:39.445 --> 00:14:41.080
SUBROGATION CLAIMS -- IN THE FUN

00:14:41.146 --> 00:14:41.914
COULD ALSO PURCHASE REINSURANCE

00:14:41.981 --> 00:14:44.717
SO THAT PROVIDES BASICALLY A

00:14:44.783 --> 00:14:46.518
FORTY FORTY MILLION DOLLARS A

00:14:46.585 --> 00:14:48.687
CLAIM SPAIN RESOURCES.

00:14:48.754 --> 00:14:49.488
ARE WE ARE FOLKS HAVE MODELED I

00:14:49.555 --> 00:14:50.689
DON'T BELIEVE THAT THAT FUND

00:14:50.756 --> 00:14:51.690
WOULD PROVIDE SUFFICIENT CLAIMS

00:14:51.757 --> 00:14:53.058
BEING RESOURCES FOR ABOUT TEN

00:14:53.125 --> 00:14:54.827
YEARS THERE COULD BE ADDITIONAL

00:14:54.893 --> 00:14:57.730
CONTRIBUTIONS. TO THE FONT IN

00:14:57.796 --> 00:14:58.731
THE FORM OF THE DUCK DOUBLES

00:14:58.797 --> 00:15:00.633
PAID BY UTILITIES BASED ON THEIR

00:15:00.699 --> 00:15:03.269
BEHAVIOR SO IF UTILITIES.

00:15:03.335 --> 00:15:05.571
ARE -- ARE THERE'S A UTILITY

00:15:05.638 --> 00:15:08.507
BECAUSE WHILE FIRE AND THE

00:15:08.574 --> 00:15:10.009
UTILITY.

00:15:10.075 --> 00:15:11.710
DID NOT.

00:15:11.777 --> 00:15:13.746
YOU KNOW HAD TO HAD SOME -- SOME

00:15:13.812 --> 00:15:15.180
FAULTS SOME NEGLIGENCE SOME --

00:15:15.247 --> 00:15:16.315
THAT WAS NOT AS GOOD AN ACTOR

00:15:16.382 --> 00:15:16.882
AND THEN THEY WOULD.

00:15:16.949 --> 00:15:18.651
REIMBURSE THE FUND IF THEY DID

00:15:18.717 --> 00:15:20.286
NOT HAVE A VALID CERTIFICATE.

00:15:20.352 --> 00:15:22.288
OR IF THEY WERE WILLFUL ACTIONS

00:15:22.354 --> 00:15:23.222
THAN THEY WOULD HAVE TO

00:15:23.289 --> 00:15:24.957
REIMBURSE THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE

00:15:25.024 --> 00:15:27.126
FIRE SO THOSE WOULD BE

00:15:27.192 --> 00:15:29.028
ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS -- HAVE

00:15:29.094 --> 00:15:31.363
I ANSWERED WHAT YOU WERE LOOKING

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:32.398
FOR ME TO COVER ALL RIGHT.

00:15:32.464 --> 00:15:33.499
SO THANK YOU AND WE'RE HAPPY TO

00:15:34.333 --> 00:15:35.768

THOUSAND FAMILIES AND BUSINESSES

THAT HAVE LOST THEIR HOMES TO I

00:16:37.329 --> 00:16:38.697
OWE YOU CAUSE FIRES.

00:16:38.764 --> 00:16:42.034
IN ABOUT FORTY ONE LAW FIRMS

00:16:42.101 --> 00:16:42.601

VICTIMS -- SO WE ARE SUPPORTING

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:50.943
AB FIFTY FOUR BECAUSE AB FIFTY

00:16:51.009 --> 00:16:52.911
FOUR IS OUR OPPORTUNITY FOR

00:16:52.978 --> 00:16:55.114
THOSE OF US ARE VICTIMS TO PUT

00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:56.448
OUR LIVES BACK IN ORDER.

00:16:56.515 --> 00:16:59.351
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY AB FIFTY

00:16:59.418 --> 00:17:01.286
FIVE TEN FIFTY FOUR IS OUR WHOLE.

00:17:01.353 --> 00:17:02.654
THAT ALL VICTIMS AND

00:17:02.721 --> 00:17:04.923
CALIFORNIANS CAN BE SAFER WE

00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:05.958
BELIEVE WITH THE PROVISIONS ARE

00:17:06.024 --> 00:17:08.160
IN THIS THIS IS GOING TO CREATE

00:17:08.227 --> 00:17:09.228
A SAFER CALIFORNIA.

00:17:09.294 --> 00:17:11.096
WE JUST RECENTLY HAD A MEETING

00:17:11.163 --> 00:17:13.065
WITH VICTIMS WITH THE GOVERNOR.

00:17:13.132 --> 00:17:14.933
AND EACH VICTIM TOLD THEIR STORY

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.735
THE FINANCIAL HARDSHIPS ARE

00:17:16.802 --> 00:17:18.670
GOING THROUGH BUT THERE'S THEY

00:17:18.737 --> 00:17:20.205
ARE HERE TODAY TO MAKE SURE WHAT

00:17:20.272 --> 00:17:22.241
HAPPENED TO US DOESN'T HAPPEN IN

00:17:22.307 --> 00:17:23.275
THE FUTURE.

00:17:23.342 --> 00:17:24.143
I WANTED TO ADDRESS THREE QUICK

00:17:24.209 --> 00:17:26.445
ISSUES I THINK THE UTILITY

00:17:26.512 --> 00:17:27.813
RELIABILITY HAS BEEN WELL

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:31.216
ADDRESSED FIRST OF ALL SAFETY.

00:17:31.283 --> 00:17:33.318
SO YOU'VE ADOPTED AN SB NINE

00:17:33.385 --> 00:17:35.154
ALIGN SUBSTANTIAL SAFETY METHODS.

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:37.122
JUDGE ALSOP HAS IMPLEMENTED

00:17:37.189 --> 00:17:39.358
MAJOR SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS

00:17:39.425 --> 00:17:41.026
THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS CAME FROM

00:17:41.093 --> 00:17:42.528
TWO OF OUR TOURNEY'S A FIFTY

00:17:42.594 --> 00:17:43.929
PAGE DOCUMENT THAT WAS ALSO

00:17:43.996 --> 00:17:45.764
GIVEN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IN

00:17:45.831 --> 00:17:46.665
YOUR STAFF.

00:17:46.732 --> 00:17:48.867
SO THERE HAS BEEN MUCH TO FOCUS

00:17:48.934 --> 00:17:50.068
ON THE UTILITIES TO MAKE SURE

00:17:50.135 --> 00:17:51.804
THEY'RE SAFER AND ACCOUNTABILITY

00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:53.906
IT'S IN THERE WE STRONGLY

00:17:53.972 --> 00:17:56.642
BELIEVE IN READING AB.

00:17:56.708 --> 00:17:57.142
TEN FIFTY FOUR THAT THE

00:17:57.209 --> 00:17:59.745
UTILITIES WILL BE SAFER AND MORE

00:17:59.812 --> 00:18:01.113
IMPORTANTLY WITH ACCOUNTABILITY

00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:02.414
IT'S JUST NOT SOMETHING THAT CAN

00:18:02.481 --> 00:18:03.982
HAPPEN IN THE NEXT TWO YEARS.

00:18:04.049 --> 00:18:05.617
THE CALIBER LEE IS THERE TO MAKE

00:18:05.684 --> 00:18:08.220
SURE SAFETY IS THERE IN THE NEXT

00:18:08.287 --> 00:18:09.621
DECADE OR TWENTY YEARS.

00:18:09.688 --> 00:18:11.290
NEXT I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT RATE

00:18:11.356 --> 00:18:12.124
PAYERS.

00:18:12.191 --> 00:18:14.560
BUT WE HAVE CAREFULLY READ TEN

00:18:14.626 --> 00:18:15.694
FIFTY FOUR WE HAVE DONE OUR

00:18:15.761 --> 00:18:17.496
DETAILED ANALYSIS AND IT'S

00:18:17.563 --> 00:18:18.964
HIGHLY COMPLICATED.

00:18:19.031 --> 00:18:21.834
BUT WE BELIEVE THAT IF YOU PASS

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:22.901
TEN FIFTY FOUR BELOW BEFORE JULY

00:18:22.968 --> 00:18:24.236
TWELFTH.

00:18:24.303 --> 00:18:25.771
IT'LL PROVIDE SUBSTANTIAL

00:18:25.838 --> 00:18:28.507
SAVINGS FOR P. JEANNIE CUSTOMERS.

00:18:28.574 --> 00:18:29.808
MAJOR SAVINGS FOR EDISON

00:18:29.875 --> 00:18:31.043
CUSTOMERS.

00:18:31.109 --> 00:18:33.812
AND IT'S PROBABLY ABOUT FLAT

00:18:33.879 --> 00:18:35.714
DEPENDING ON WHERE BILLS FOR SB

00:18:35.781 --> 00:18:36.849
ANY CUSTOMERS AND THAT'S

00:18:36.915 --> 00:18:38.984
ASSUMING THAT THE D. W. R.

00:18:39.051 --> 00:18:41.487
CAPITALIZATION IS AN INCREASE

00:18:41.553 --> 00:18:42.688
NOT A PASS THROUGH WITH THAT.

00:18:42.754 --> 00:18:44.289
WE BELIEVE THIS IS A SAVINGS FOR

00:18:44.356 --> 00:18:47.659
OUR RATE PAYERS IN THE LONG TERM --

00:18:47.726 --> 00:18:49.528
AND FINALLY FOR VICTIMS.

00:18:49.595 --> 00:18:52.297
THERE IS LANGUAGE IN THERE.

00:18:52.364 --> 00:18:53.499
THAT IN TWO WAYS FOR VICTIMS

00:18:53.565 --> 00:18:56.401
FIRST IT FORCES P. JEANNIE

00:18:56.468 --> 00:18:58.036
QUICKLY TO GET THE TABLE.

00:18:58.103 --> 00:18:59.338
NOW THEY HAVE  FIRE SEASON

00:18:59.404 --> 00:19:00.606
COMING IN THEY NEED TO BE IN

00:19:00.672 --> 00:19:02.608
THIS FUN THEY NEED TO SETTLE

00:19:02.674 --> 00:19:04.810
BANKRUPTCY FOR FOR THE GET THEIR

00:19:04.877 --> 00:19:06.311
JUNE TWENTY TWENTY IS THERE

00:19:06.378 --> 00:19:07.779
WITHIN IT BUT IT PUTS MUCH

00:19:07.846 --> 00:19:09.181
LEVERAGE WITH AND IT.

00:19:09.248 --> 00:19:10.682
WAS ALSO LANGUAGE IN THE BILL

00:19:10.749 --> 00:19:12.818
THE KIDS ARE ABILITY TO TELL HOW

00:19:12.885 --> 00:19:14.853
MUCH TO PROPERLY COMPENSATE

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:16.088
VICTIMS WITH THEN.

00:19:16.154 --> 00:19:17.089
SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT ALL THAT

00:19:17.155 --> 00:19:18.957
TOGETHER WE ARE STRONGLY

00:19:19.024 --> 00:19:20.859

WHAT WE BELIEVE IS A THE BEST

00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:33.238
POSSIBLE.

00:19:33.305 --> 00:19:34.873
POSSIBILITY PROVIDING SAFETY

00:39:48.753 --> 00:39:51.155
ON A BILL.

00:39:51.222 --> 00:39:52.590
THERE IS.

00:39:52.656 --> 00:39:54.558
IMPORTANT THINGS WE DON'T LIKE

00:39:54.625 --> 00:39:55.860
ABOUT THE BILL BUT THE IMPORTANT

00:39:55.926 --> 00:39:57.995
THINGS WE DO LIKE WE DO LIKE THE

00:39:58.062 --> 00:40:00.631
FACT THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME

00:40:00.698 --> 00:40:03.367

POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS OF

00:40:08.906 --> 00:40:11.509
RAPE HERE CONTRIBUTIONS WE THINK

00:40:11.575 --> 00:40:13.844
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT UTILITIES

00:40:13.911 --> 00:40:16.547
ARE ALSO GOING TO BE REQUIRED TO

00:40:16.614 --> 00:40:19.583

00:40:19.650 --> 00:40:20.751
FUNDS.

00:40:20.818 --> 00:40:21.585
WE ALSO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

00:40:21.652 --> 00:40:24.922
THAT THE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

00:40:24.989 --> 00:40:26.657
IS GOING TO BE LINKED TO FIRE

00:40:26.724 --> 00:40:27.792

THIS BILL THAT.

00:40:34.231 --> 00:40:36.967

PACKAGE THAT IS IN FRONT OF US

00:40:43.774 --> 00:40:45.843
THIS BILL DOES NOT TURN OUT THE

00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:48.679
WAY THAT ITS PROMISE THAT IT IF

00:40:48.746 --> 00:40:51.348
IT DOES NOT PROTECT RATEPAYERS

00:40:51.415 --> 00:40:52.616
THE WAY THAT IT'S PROMISED WE

00:40:52.683 --> 00:40:57.054
RESERVE THE RIGHT. TO COME BACK

00:40:57.121 --> 00:41:00.024

MY NAME IS WILLIAM ABRAMS -- I

00:43:01.378 --> 00:43:04.581
AM A WILDFIRE SURVIVOR FROM THE

TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN NORTH BAY

HOPING THAT WOULD BE -- IN THE

00:43:09.153 --> 00:43:11.889
PREVIOUS LINE -- AND I'M NOT --

00:43:11.956 --> 00:43:13.457
THIS CHRISTMAS TREE FOR

00:43:13.524 --> 00:43:15.125
UTILITIES HAS TOO MANY ORNAMENTS

00:43:15.192 --> 00:43:17.394
ON IT I TRIED TO REACH OUT.

00:43:17.461 --> 00:43:19.530
TO MANY FOLKS -- ON ALL SIDES OF

00:43:19.596 --> 00:43:21.765
THIS ISSUE TO TRY TO GET SOME OF

00:43:21.832 --> 00:43:23.634
THOSE ORNAMENTS OFF THE TREE BUT

00:43:23.701 --> 00:43:25.102
THEY'RE STILL ON THERE THERE IS

00:43:25.169 --> 00:43:26.837
LESS OVERSIGHT.

00:43:26.904 --> 00:43:29.940
AND LESS ACCOUNTABILITY IN THIS

00:43:30.007 --> 00:43:30.874
BILL THEN CURRENT STATE.

00:43:30.941 --> 00:43:33.010
THERE IS LESS TRANSPARENCY IN

00:43:33.077 --> 00:43:34.278
THIS CURRENT BILL THEN CURRENT

00:43:34.345 --> 00:43:36.246
STATE.

00:43:36.313 --> 00:43:38.916
THERE IS LOOPHOLES PUT INTO THIS

00:43:38.983 --> 00:43:41.185
BILL THAT THE UTILITIES AND

00:43:41.251 --> 00:43:42.653
THEIR ATTORNEYS WILL DRIVE

00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:44.888
TRUCKS THROUGH.

00:43:44.955 --> 00:43:46.690
I WANT TO BE IN THE OTHER LINE I

00:43:46.757 --> 00:43:48.559
CANNOT SUPPORT THIS BILL AND

00:43:48.625 --> 00:43:50.160
MAKES BREAKS MY HEART.

00:43:50.227 --> 00:43:51.729
THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE.

00:43:51.795 --> 00:43:53.397
WHO ARE AFFECTED BY THE FIRES

00:43:53.464 --> 00:43:56.300
THAT -- THEY NEED THE MONEY.

00:43:56.367 --> 00:43:58.369
AND I UNDERSTAND AND I

00:43:58.435 --> 00:44:00.004
SYMPATHIZE WITH THE FOLKS WHO

00:44:00.070 --> 00:44:01.605
ARE ON THAT SIDE AND I WANT TO

00:44:01.672 --> 00:44:03.474
BE THERE BUT I CANNOT IN GOOD

00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:05.476
CONSCIOUS SUPPORT THE BILL.

00:44:05.542 --> 00:44:07.478
ON THE BACKS OF FUTURE WILDFIRES

00:44:07.544 --> 00:44:09.413
SURVIVORS AND THAT'S WHAT THIS

00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:09.947
DOES.

00:44:10.014 --> 00:44:12.649
THIS LESSONS ACCOUNTABILITY FOR

00:44:12.716 --> 00:44:14.418
THE UTILITIES.

00:44:14.485 --> 00:44:17.855
AND IT HOLDS THEM TO A LOWER

00:44:17.921 --> 00:44:19.423
STANDARD.

00:44:19.490 --> 00:44:20.691
THERE WAS A QUOTE FROM THE

00:44:20.758 --> 00:44:22.526
STRIKE FORCE REPORT HOW THAT WAS

00:44:22.593 --> 00:44:24.328
RELIED UPON FOR THE CREATION OF

00:44:24.395 --> 00:44:25.529
THIS BILL LET ME QUOTE THE

00:44:25.596 --> 00:44:26.864
STRIKE FORCE REPORT.

00:44:26.930 --> 00:44:28.098
THIS SHOULD BE BASED UPON THE

00:44:28.165 --> 00:44:30.968
SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE BASED RISK

00:44:31.035 --> 00:44:33.003
MITIGATION METRICS THAT ARE

00:44:33.070 --> 00:44:35.472
INDEPENDENTLY AND SCIENTIFICALLY

00:44:35.539 --> 00:44:36.974
VERIFIED.

00:44:37.041 --> 00:44:39.076
NOTHING CLOSE TO THAT AND THIS

00:44:39.143 --> 00:44:42.813
BILL THIS IS GENERALITIES OF A

00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:44.715
REASONABLE LIST WITH CAVIAR IT'S

00:44:44.782 --> 00:44:46.550
THERE ARE MADE FOR THE UTILITIES

00:44:46.617 --> 00:44:48.218
TO DRIVE TRUCKS THROUGH THESE

00:44:48.285 --> 00:44:49.420
PROVISIONS.

00:44:49.486 --> 00:44:52.189
THIS IS NO WHERE CLOSE TO WHERE

00:44:52.256 --> 00:44:54.458
IT NEEDS TO BE IT'S ONE THING I

00:44:54.525 --> 00:44:55.492
WAS PERFECTLY FINE WITH IT

00:44:55.559 --> 00:44:57.661
ANYBODY STEP FORWARD THIS AIN'T

00:44:57.728 --> 00:44:59.963
THAT THIS IS STEPS BACK.

00:45:00.030 --> 00:45:01.665
WE CAN'T TAKE STEPS BACK FROM

00:45:01.732 --> 00:45:03.634
THIS THE ONLY THING THAT'S GOING

00:45:03.700 --> 00:45:05.202
TO HELP THE UTILITIES I HOPE TO

00:45:05.269 --> 00:45:08.005
IMPROVE THEIR CREDIT RATING

00:45:08.072 --> 00:45:09.206
WHICH I WOULD LOVE.

00:45:09.273 --> 00:45:10.541
AS THEY GET PERFORMANCE BATES

00:45:10.607 --> 00:45:12.176
METRICS ARE PLAN A STRATEGY THAT

00:45:12.242 --> 00:45:14.478
IS NOT ARTIFICIALLY PROPPED UP

00:45:14.545 --> 00:45:16.113
BUT THERE'S THEM WORKING TO MAKE

00:45:16.180 --> 00:45:17.281
US SAFER.

00:45:17.347 --> 00:45:19.349
THAT IS THE ONLY PATH FORWARD

00:45:19.416 --> 00:45:21.585
SET THE METRIC SET SPECIFIC

00:45:21.652 --> 00:45:23.020
STANDARDS IN DRIVE TO THOSE

00:45:23.087 --> 00:45:25.422
STANDARDS THIS DOES NOT DO THAT

00:45:25.489 --> 00:45:26.824
THERE'S NOTHING IN HERE THAT

00:45:26.890 --> 00:45:28.625
DIRECTS THAT ADDS THREE LAYERS

00:45:28.692 --> 00:45:29.927
OF BUREAUCRACY.

00:45:29.993 --> 00:45:32.296
ON TOP OF THE CPU.

00:45:32.362 --> 00:45:33.997
AND BY THE WAY I SHOULD ALSO SAY

00:45:34.064 --> 00:45:35.766
I AM THE ONLY INDIVIDUAL

00:45:35.833 --> 00:45:37.668
RESIDENT WHO IS A PARTY TO THE

00:45:37.734 --> 00:45:39.369
WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLANS

00:45:39.436 --> 00:45:42.272
BEFORE THE CPUC AND BY ALL MEANS

00:45:42.339 --> 00:45:43.674
THERE ARE ISSUES THERE.

00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:44.942
AND THAT IS NOT A PERFECT

00:45:45.008 --> 00:45:47.511
REGULATORY BODY BY ANY MEANS BUT

00:45:47.578 --> 00:45:49.379
THROWING ADDITIONAL LAYERS OF

00:45:49.446 --> 00:45:50.447
BUREAUCRACY ON TOP OF THAT

00:45:50.514 --> 00:45:52.983
ORGANIZATION AND THEN JUST.

00:45:53.050 --> 00:45:54.885
CALLING THAT A CURE IS NOT A

00:45:54.952 --> 00:45:57.087
SOLUTION WE NEED TO MAKE SURE

00:45:57.154 --> 00:45:58.822
THAT THIS IS MADE FOR THEIR ALSO

00:45:58.889 --> 00:46:01.125
IN THIS LIMITED TO IGNITIONS HOW

00:46:01.191 --> 00:46:02.526
DID THAT GET IN THERE.

00:46:02.593 --> 00:46:05.062
DOROTHY SPREAD THE WILDFIRE AND

00:46:05.129 --> 00:46:06.997
IT CONTINUES ON THAT'S NO LONGER

00:46:07.064 --> 00:46:08.765
THEIR RESPONSIBILITY IT'S ONLY

00:46:08.832 --> 00:46:11.502
IGNITIONS THAT IS RIDICULOUS

00:46:11.568 --> 00:46:13.704
THERE IS A THIS IS A SLOW WALK

00:46:13.770 --> 00:46:15.239
AWAY FROM INVERSE CONDEMNATION

00:46:15.305 --> 00:46:16.607
WHICH AGAIN I SUPPORT.

00:46:16.673 --> 00:46:18.208
IF IT'S DONE WITH THOUGHT THIS

00:46:18.275 --> 00:46:20.611
IS A RUSH IN HASTE TO GET THIS

00:46:20.677 --> 00:46:26.049
DONE BY THE END OF THE WEEK AND

00:46:26.116 --> 00:46:27.784
IT'S TOO IMPORTANT FOR THAT.

00:46:27.851 --> 00:46:28.352
I'M MORE FOR ROLLING UP OUR

00:46:28.418 --> 00:46:28.952
SLEEVES AND I WANT TO SUPPORT

00:46:29.019 --> 00:46:30.287
THIS BUT I WOULD SUGGEST ROLLING

UP OUR SLEEVES.

00:46:31.221 --> 00:46:31.822
SITTING DOWN GETTING ALL

INCLUDING THE ONES THAT ARE FOR

00:46:34.424 --> 00:46:35.659

MUCH A GREAT ROLE AT ROAD

NOT SITTING IN THIS ROOM TODAY.

00:46:52.643 --> 00:46:53.844

00:53:43.453 --> 00:53:44.888
OCCUR THAT'S TRIGGERED BY

00:53:44.955 --> 00:53:46.356
UTILITY EQUIPMENT.

00:53:46.423 --> 00:53:47.824
WE CAN'T DO THAT BUT HERE'S WHAT

00:53:47.891 --> 00:53:49.526
WE DO KNOW.

00:53:49.593 --> 00:53:51.428
IF THE PATTERN THAT WAS

00:53:51.494 --> 00:53:52.963
ESTABLISHED OVER THE LAST TWO

00:53:53.029 --> 00:53:56.099
YEARS WERE TO CONTINUE.

00:53:56.166 --> 00:53:57.901
INTO THE FUTURE IF WE DO HAVE

00:53:57.968 --> 00:54:00.403
LIABILITIES OF THE MAGNITUDE

00:54:00.470 --> 00:54:01.237
THAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE LAST TWO

00:54:01.304 --> 00:54:04.407
YEARS CONTINUING GOING FORWARD.

00:54:04.474 --> 00:54:06.309
THEN WILL QUICKLY GET TO A POINT

00:54:06.376 --> 00:54:08.078
WHERE WE'RE AND OF COURSE THAT'S

00:54:08.144 --> 00:54:10.080
UNSUSTAINABLE FOR RATEPAYERS.

00:54:10.146 --> 00:54:11.615
AND IT'S UNSUSTAINABLE FOR

00:54:11.681 --> 00:54:14.150
SHAREHOLDERS OF THE UTILITIES AS

00:54:14.217 --> 00:54:15.619
WELL AND LET ME TRY [inaudible]

00:54:15.685 --> 00:54:17.621
TO FAIRLY BRIEFLY.

00:54:17.687 --> 00:54:19.189
EXPLAIN WHY SAYING THAT.

00:54:19.255 --> 00:54:20.724
I'VE HANDED OUT SOME SLIDES TO

00:54:20.790 --> 00:54:22.058
YOU TO KEEP THINGS MOVING IF YOU

00:54:22.125 --> 00:54:25.095
MOVE TO THE FOURTH SLIDE IT

00:54:25.161 --> 00:54:27.797
SHOWS US FROM RED IMPROVE OUR

00:54:27.864 --> 00:54:29.199
GRASS.

00:54:29.265 --> 00:54:32.002
THE THE BLUE -- BUYERS AND THIS

00:54:32.068 --> 00:54:34.104
GRAPH SHOW WITH THE A PATTERN OF

00:54:34.170 --> 00:54:37.540
RATE INCREASES -- FOR

00:54:37.607 --> 00:54:38.475
RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS.

00:54:38.541 --> 00:54:40.510
HAVE BEEN OVER THE LAST TEN

00:54:40.577 --> 00:54:41.544
YEARS.

00:54:41.611 --> 00:54:43.179
FOR A FOR P. JEANNIE TO USE THEM

00:54:43.246 --> 00:54:45.081
AS AN EXAMPLE THE THE THE

00:54:45.148 --> 00:54:46.916
CURRENT -- THE CURRENT AVERAGE

00:54:46.983 --> 00:54:49.185
BILL FOR RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS

00:54:49.252 --> 00:54:49.719
ACROSS ONE HUNDRED TWELVE

00:54:49.786 --> 00:54:50.620
DOLLARS.

00:54:50.687 --> 00:54:53.056
THE RED BARS HERE INDICATE.

00:54:53.123 --> 00:54:56.593
WHAT THE TYPE OF INCREASE IT TO

00:54:56.660 --> 00:54:57.661
THE AVERAGE BILL WE TEND TO SEE

00:54:57.727 --> 00:55:00.697
A YEAR IN YEAR OUT BASIS IF WE

00:55:00.764 --> 00:55:02.065
HAVE TO CONTINUE?

00:55:02.132 --> 00:55:04.267
TO HAVE THE UTILITY OF FLOOD

00:55:04.334 --> 00:55:06.803
MINDS. TO IN PAY BACK --

00:55:06.870 --> 00:55:09.072
WILDFIRE ACOSTA OVER A FIFTEEN

00:55:09.139 --> 00:55:10.740
OR TWENTY YEAR PERIOD AS YOU CAN

00:55:10.807 --> 00:55:13.476
SEE THE IN THE READ THE AMOUNT

00:55:13.543 --> 00:55:13.910
THAT WOULD.

00:55:13.977 --> 00:55:16.446
THAT WOULD BE ADDED TO THE BILL

00:55:16.513 --> 00:55:19.315
AS RESULT OF WILDFIRES WOULD BE

00:55:19.382 --> 00:55:20.517
WHICH IS ENTIRELY DWARF WHAT WE

00:55:20.583 --> 00:55:22.085
NORMALLY WOULD EXPECT IN TERMS

00:55:22.152 --> 00:55:23.353
OF RATE INCREASES.

00:55:23.420 --> 00:55:24.287
IF YOU LOOK AT THE FOLLOWING

00:55:24.354 --> 00:55:25.188
GRAPH.

00:55:25.255 --> 00:55:25.822
I'VE DONE SOMETHING WHICH IS A

00:55:25.889 --> 00:55:28.958
LITTLE BIT MORE REALISTIC WHICH

00:55:29.025 --> 00:55:30.694
IS.

00:55:30.760 --> 00:55:32.228
TO PILE THE RED BRED BUYERS ON

00:55:32.295 --> 00:55:32.829
TOP OF THE BLUE BECAUSE WE'RE

00:55:32.896 --> 00:55:33.830
GOING TO CONTINUE TO SEE RATE

00:55:33.897 --> 00:55:36.599
INCREASES. FR THE USUAL REASONS

00:55:36.666 --> 00:55:37.333
THE UTILITIES HAVE TO RATE

00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:39.569
INCREASES IF WE ADD ON TOP OF

00:55:39.636 --> 00:55:40.236
THAT.

00:55:40.303 --> 00:55:43.940
THE THE AMOUNTS THAT COULD OCCUR

00:55:44.007 --> 00:55:45.508
WITH WELFARE LIABILITIES.

00:55:45.575 --> 00:55:46.943
YOU CAN SEE THAT WITHIN A IN

00:55:47.010 --> 00:55:48.144
THIS ILLUSTRATION SIX OR SEVEN

00:55:48.211 --> 00:55:49.713
YEARS YOU'VE ACTUALLY DOUBLE THE

00:55:49.779 --> 00:55:51.881
BILL -- FOR RESIDENTIAL

00:55:51.948 --> 00:55:53.583
CUSTOMERS.

00:55:53.650 --> 00:55:56.619
THE THE PROBLEM WITH WITH THIS.

00:55:56.686 --> 00:55:57.887
THE SCENARIOS IF YOU MOVE TO THE

00:55:57.954 --> 00:55:59.889
NEXT GRAPH IT IS THAT WE'RE

00:55:59.956 --> 00:56:01.191
ALREADY ON A COURSE TO FIRE X.

00:56:01.257 --> 00:56:02.325
FAR EXCEED.

00:56:02.392 --> 00:56:04.494
WHAT LOOKED LIKE THE NORMAL KIND

00:56:04.561 --> 00:56:05.495
OF RATING CURSES WOULD OCCUR

00:56:05.562 --> 00:56:07.130
OKAY I CAN A TRIP TO FOR A

00:56:07.197 --> 00:56:08.932
SECOND ABSOLUTELY -- HERTZBERG

00:56:08.998 --> 00:56:11.401
WANTS TO MAKE SOME -- CLAIRE

00:56:11.468 --> 00:56:12.802
FARMER MY I JUST EAT YOU WE THE

00:56:12.869 --> 00:56:14.170
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HAVE

00:56:14.237 --> 00:56:15.538
THIS THESE DOCUMENTS THAT YOU

00:56:15.605 --> 00:56:17.073
GAVE THAT ARE QUITE INSTRUCTIVE

00:56:17.140 --> 00:56:19.042
YES SHOWING THAT THE RATES OF

00:56:19.109 --> 00:56:20.376
THE BILL'S GOING UP BETWEEN A

00:56:20.443 --> 00:56:21.244
HUNDRED TWELVE DOLLARS TO TWO

00:56:21.311 --> 00:56:22.479
AND TWELVE DOLLARS THE NEXT

00:56:22.545 --> 00:56:24.314
PAGES SHOWING THE SAME NUMBERS.

00:56:24.380 --> 00:56:24.914
CAN YOU JUST EXPLAIN THAT FOR

00:56:24.981 --> 00:56:27.350
THE POPE THE THIRTY TWO MILLION

00:56:27.417 --> 00:56:27.917
PEOPLE ARE WATCHING THISAND

00:56:27.984 --> 00:56:33.490
THIS AUDIENCE TODAY AND FOR THE

00:56:33.556 --> 00:56:33.790
PEOPLE HERE.

00:56:33.857 --> 00:56:36.226
THANK YOU.

00:56:36.292 --> 00:56:37.293
YES IT IT.

00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:38.528
IF THIS IS A CLASS I USUALLY

00:56:38.595 --> 00:56:39.996
DON'T GET TO TALK TO BUT I WAS

00:56:40.063 --> 00:56:40.764
KIND OF HOPING IT WOULD BE THE

00:56:40.830 --> 00:56:41.831
USUAL PROJECTOR WHERE I COULD

00:56:41.898 --> 00:56:42.599
SHOW THIS TO EVERYBODY.

00:56:42.665 --> 00:56:44.634
BUT SO WHAT WHAT THAT WOULD HAVE

00:56:44.701 --> 00:56:45.935
DONE IN THIS VIRUS IS -- TO IS

00:56:46.002 --> 00:56:51.307
TO FIRST IS HAVE BEEN ACROSS THE

00:56:51.374 --> 00:56:52.876
BOARD FOR P. GINNY OVER THE LAST

00:56:52.942 --> 00:56:54.244
SEVERAL YEARS THOSE ARE

00:56:54.310 --> 00:56:55.712
INDICATED.

00:56:55.779 --> 00:56:58.047
IN BLUE AND THE FIRST PARAGRAPH

00:56:58.114 --> 00:57:01.050
AND IN THE WHAT I'VE DONE IN RED

00:57:01.117 --> 00:57:02.819
IS TO SAY OKAY LE IF THE UTILITY

00:57:02.886 --> 00:57:04.888
WERE TO FACE A TEN TO FIFTEEN

00:57:04.954 --> 00:57:06.389
BILLION DOLLAR ADDITIONAL.

00:57:06.456 --> 00:57:08.792
LIABILITY DO A UTILITY TRIGGERED

00:57:08.858 --> 00:57:11.394
FIRE AN ANNUAL BASIS AND IF

00:57:11.461 --> 00:57:13.163
THESE CUTS WERE THE PASS THROUGH

00:57:13.229 --> 00:57:14.531
A TO THE RATE PAYERS THAT YOU

00:57:14.597 --> 00:57:15.732
WOULD SEE.

00:57:15.799 --> 00:57:18.568
APPROXIMATELY OF A A 10%

00:57:18.635 --> 00:57:20.303
INCREASE.

00:57:20.370 --> 00:57:22.772
IN THE RATES OF AN ANNUAL BASIS

00:57:22.839 --> 00:57:24.007
AND COURSE THOSE.

00:57:24.073 --> 00:57:25.542
THOSE CONTINUE TO COMPILE A TOP

00:57:25.608 --> 00:57:27.343
OF EACH OTHER I WOULD HAVE DONE

00:57:27.410 --> 00:57:28.945
THE SECOND SET A PROGRESS IS TO

00:57:29.012 --> 00:57:31.114
pWHEN I SHOWED IN BLUE YOU'D

00:57:31.181 --> 00:57:32.816
EXPECT THAT TO HAPPEN ANYWAY

00:57:32.882 --> 00:57:34.150
YOU'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO HAVE?

00:57:34.217 --> 00:57:37.220
BUSINESS AS USUAL RATE INCREASES.

00:57:37.287 --> 00:57:38.721
BUT ON TOP OF THAT IF YOU HAVE

00:57:38.788 --> 00:57:39.923
THE WILD FIRE LIABILITIES YOU'RE

00:57:39.989 --> 00:57:41.524
GONNA HAVE AN EXTRAORDINARY

00:57:41.591 --> 00:57:42.458
IMPACT.

00:57:42.525 --> 00:57:44.828
AND AN OVERALL RATE SOMETHING TO

00:57:44.894 --> 00:57:46.763
FRANKLY WOULD NEVER STORE COOLEY

00:57:46.830 --> 00:57:52.902
SEEN IN PROPORTIONS LIKE THIS.

00:57:52.969 --> 00:57:53.937
NOW IS THE THE GRAPH TO FOLLOW

00:57:54.003 --> 00:57:54.737
SO WHICH IS SOMETHING IS

00:57:54.804 --> 00:57:56.172
CONTRIBUTED TO ME BY THE PUBLIC

00:57:56.239 --> 00:57:57.207
ADVOCATE'S OFFICE AT THE PC --

00:57:57.273 --> 00:57:58.174
SHOWS THAT WERE ALREADY ON A

00:57:58.241 --> 00:58:00.677
COURSE -- FOR INCREASES JUST

00:58:00.743 --> 00:58:02.378
WITHIN THE NEXT YEAR THAT COULD

00:58:02.445 --> 00:58:04.080
BE AS GREAT AS THE INCREASES ON

00:58:04.147 --> 00:58:06.182
AVERAGE SO WE SAW OVER THE LAST

00:58:06.249 --> 00:58:07.050
TEN YEARS.

00:58:07.116 --> 00:58:08.484
A BECAUSE SAID P. JEANNIE SO OF

00:58:08.551 --> 00:58:10.286
PENDING GENERATE CASE AND A

00:58:10.353 --> 00:58:11.888
REQUEST INCREASE ITS RETURN ON

00:58:11.955 --> 00:58:13.957
EQUITY BECAUSE OF THE ADDITIONAL

00:58:14.023 --> 00:58:16.226
RISK IT'S PERCEIVING DID AWHILE

00:58:16.292 --> 00:58:16.559
FIRES.

00:58:16.626 --> 00:58:19.462
A AND IN THIS SHOWS THAT -- IN

00:58:19.529 --> 00:58:22.165
IN YELLOW IF THE IF THE BOTH

00:58:22.232 --> 00:58:24.000
THOSE REQUESTS ARE GRANTED YOU

00:58:24.067 --> 00:58:25.535
COULD HAVE AN INCREASE.

00:58:25.602 --> 00:58:29.005
OF OF THE TWENTY THE TWENTY FOUR

00:58:29.072 --> 00:58:30.206
UP TO TWENTY FOUR CENTS PER

00:58:30.273 --> 00:58:32.108
KILOWATT HOUR ON AVERAGE FROM

00:58:32.175 --> 00:58:36.646
ABOUT TWENTY CENTS ON AVERAGE.

00:58:36.713 --> 00:58:37.680
JUST IN ONE YEAR [inaudible]

00:58:37.747 --> 00:58:39.816
IF THE IF THE A REQUEST FOR

00:58:39.883 --> 00:58:40.950
INCREASING RETRAIN EQUITIES NOT

00:58:41.017 --> 00:58:41.818
GRANTED THEN THE BLUE LINE --

00:58:41.885 --> 00:58:44.487
WOULD APPLY BUT EITHER WAY.

00:58:44.554 --> 00:58:46.456
THESE RATE INCREASES IN ONE YEAR

00:58:46.522 --> 00:58:46.990
WOULD BE AS GREAT AS THE

00:58:47.056 --> 00:58:48.091
CUMULATIVE.

00:58:48.157 --> 00:58:49.926
AVERAGE RATE INCREASES THAT WE

00:58:49.993 --> 00:58:52.829
pDECADE SO WE'RE ALREADY ON

00:58:52.896 --> 00:58:55.665
COURSE. FOR DRAMATICALLY HIGHER

00:58:55.732 --> 00:58:58.434
UTILITY RATES IF YOU LOOK AT THE

00:58:58.501 --> 00:58:59.936
GRAPH TO FOLLOWS A SUPERIMPOSED

00:59:00.003 --> 00:59:01.638
A LINE ON TOP OF THE BAR GRAPHS

00:59:01.704 --> 00:59:03.172
TO SHOW YOU.

00:59:03.239 --> 00:59:03.973
THE WHAT THE TRENDS WOULD LOOK

00:59:04.040 --> 00:59:04.841
LIKE.

00:59:04.908 --> 00:59:06.743
CONSIDERING THE REQUESTED PGD IS

00:59:06.809 --> 00:59:08.211
MADE FOR RATE INCREASES THIS

00:59:08.278 --> 00:59:11.281
YEAR SO WE'RE WE'RE ON TRACK --

00:59:11.347 --> 00:59:12.615
FOR FOR VERY DRAMATIC READING

00:59:12.682 --> 00:59:14.117
CREASES -- THEY'VE THE MUCH

00:59:14.183 --> 00:59:16.586
WORSE OF COURSE -- IF -- IF WE

00:59:16.653 --> 00:59:18.021
WERE TO GET TO A POINT.

00:59:18.087 --> 00:59:19.555
WHERE WE HAD TO COULD CONTINUE

00:59:19.622 --> 00:59:20.723
TO PASS ON?

00:59:20.790 --> 00:59:22.859
A CONSIDERABLE WILDFIRE

00:59:22.926 --> 00:59:24.694
LIABILITY SO WE CAN PASS IT IN

00:59:24.761 --> 00:59:26.429
THE FOR THE SAKE OF TIME.

00:59:26.496 --> 00:59:28.031
MANY OF THESE OTHER -- GRASS AND

00:59:28.097 --> 00:59:29.365
LET ME JUST GO BACK TOWARD THE

00:59:29.432 --> 00:59:30.500
BACK OF THE PACK.

00:59:30.566 --> 00:59:31.167
NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE

00:59:31.234 --> 00:59:32.902
SECOND PROBLEM THE FIRST PROBLEM

00:59:32.969 --> 00:59:36.639
IS IT P. GENIES RATES ARE GOING

00:59:36.706 --> 00:59:37.440
TO GO UP ANYWAY.

00:59:37.507 --> 00:59:37.974
THE SECOND PROBLEM IS THAT

00:59:38.041 --> 00:59:38.708
UTILITIES ARE NOT GOING TO BE

00:59:38.775 --> 00:59:39.509
ABLE TO CONTINUE TO BORROW MONEY

00:59:39.575 --> 00:59:41.177
YEAR AFTER YEAR TO SPREAD OUT

00:59:41.244 --> 00:59:42.979
THE COST OF WILD.

00:59:43.046 --> 00:59:44.580
I THOUGHT IT SAID THERE AREN'T

00:59:44.647 --> 00:59:45.848
ANY NUMBERS ANTICIPATED JUST.

00:59:45.915 --> 00:59:47.951
SHOWS A PROBLEM NUMBER TWO AND

00:59:48.017 --> 00:59:50.019
WILL IMMEDIATELY MOVE TO THE

00:59:50.086 --> 00:59:52.055
NEXT NEXT SHEET.

00:59:52.121 --> 00:59:55.191
THE THE YES IF YOU MOVE TO THE

00:59:55.258 --> 00:59:57.994
NEXT PAGE AFTER THAT THE THE

00:59:58.061 --> 00:59:59.529
TABLE TO YOU SEE HERE IS PREVENT

00:59:59.595 --> 01:00:02.065
PROVIDED BY THE PC.

01:00:02.131 --> 01:00:03.533
IT SHOWS WHAT THE USUAL.

01:00:03.599 --> 01:00:05.768
RATIO IS BETWEEN AT THE

01:00:05.835 --> 01:00:06.736
UTILITIES.

01:00:06.803 --> 01:00:08.371
DEBT AND IT'S EQUITY THE AMOUNT

01:00:08.438 --> 01:00:09.238
OF MONEY IT GETS FROM

01:00:09.305 --> 01:00:10.807
SHAREHOLDERS FOR SYSTEMATIC

01:00:10.873 --> 01:00:11.040
MONEY.

01:00:11.107 --> 01:00:13.609
THAT IT BORROWS A IN THE THE

01:00:13.676 --> 01:00:15.778
USUAL RULE OF THUMB IS THE ONE

01:00:15.845 --> 01:00:17.647
TO SEE SOMETHING CLOSE TO PARITY

01:00:17.714 --> 01:00:20.450
BETWEEN THE RELIANCE AND THAT.

01:00:20.516 --> 01:00:21.651
AND THE RELIANCE ON EQUITY.

01:00:21.718 --> 01:00:24.087
PRIOR TO THE IF YOU HAD EXACT

01:00:24.153 --> 01:00:26.389
PARITY THEN YOU'D HAVE A RATIO

01:00:26.456 --> 01:00:28.224
OF ONE POINT NO.

01:00:28.291 --> 01:00:29.592
PETER YOU NEED FOR A FOR A IT

01:00:29.659 --> 01:00:30.994
STARTED MOVING TOWARD BANKRUPTCY

01:00:31.060 --> 01:00:32.595
WAS FAIRLY CLOSE TO THAT AHEAD

01:00:32.662 --> 01:00:34.063
OF A RACIAL POINT.

01:00:34.130 --> 01:00:35.298
NINE AND THEN DIALED A DRAMATIC

01:00:35.365 --> 01:00:36.966
AMOUNT OF MONEY TO PREPARE

01:00:37.033 --> 01:00:38.468
ITSELF TO GO INTO BANKRUPTCY.

01:00:38.534 --> 01:00:41.738
IN A RATIO WENT FROM POINT NINE

01:00:41.804 --> 01:00:42.638
UP TO ONE POINT.

01:00:42.705 --> 01:00:43.539
SEVEN THE HEALTHY RANGE YOU

01:00:43.606 --> 01:00:45.274
EXPECT TO SEE A RANGE SOMEWHERE

01:00:45.341 --> 01:00:47.710
IN THE POINT SIX TO ONE POINT OO

01:00:47.777 --> 01:00:48.544
A RANGE.

01:00:48.611 --> 01:00:51.147
AND SO IF THE UTILITIES HAVE TO

01:00:51.214 --> 01:00:53.116
DIRECTLY BORROW MONEY YEAR IN

01:00:53.182 --> 01:00:54.650
AND YEAR OUT IN ORDER TO PAY FOR

01:00:54.717 --> 01:00:56.753
WELFARE LIABILITIES THEN QUICKLY

01:00:56.819 --> 01:00:58.488
GET TO A POINT WHERE THEY WOULD

01:00:58.554 --> 01:01:00.323
APPEAR TO BE AN UNHEALTHY. TOO

01:01:00.390 --> 01:01:02.158
RISKY INVESTMENT AND THAT WOULD

01:01:02.225 --> 01:01:04.327
RAISE AGAIN THE COST OF OF OF

01:01:04.394 --> 01:01:06.662
BORROWING MONEY IT ALSO WOULD

01:01:06.729 --> 01:01:09.132
ATTEND. TO TWO BECAUSE INVESTORS

01:01:09.198 --> 01:01:11.834
AND INSURE STOCK. TO TO SHY AWAY

01:01:11.901 --> 01:01:13.936
FROM THE COMPANY SO -- SO THAT

01:01:14.003 --> 01:01:15.171
THAT'S WHERE WE WOULD BE IF WE

01:01:15.238 --> 01:01:16.639
JUST WOULD ALLOW.

01:01:16.706 --> 01:01:18.041
THE UTILITY SIXTEEN OF OUR MONEY

01:01:18.107 --> 01:01:19.075
A YEAR IN AND YEAR OUT IN THAT

01:01:19.142 --> 01:01:21.377
WAY THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS.

01:01:21.444 --> 01:01:23.479
THAT PEOPLE TALK IN TERMS OF

01:01:23.546 --> 01:01:25.648
SECURITAS SING OF THE MONEY THAT

01:01:25.715 --> 01:01:27.483
UTILITY HAVE TO BORROW A WHERE

01:01:27.550 --> 01:01:28.017
INSTANTLY YOU WOULD HAVE

01:01:28.084 --> 01:01:30.253
ACTUALLY A DEDICATED COMPONENT

01:01:30.319 --> 01:01:31.254
ON UTILITY RATE.

01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:33.122
THAT WOULD COVER THE COST FOR

01:01:33.189 --> 01:01:35.458
PARTICULAR ASSET OF BINDS.

01:01:35.525 --> 01:01:36.793
I AND THAT'S CONSIDERED TO BE

01:01:36.859 --> 01:01:37.994
SOMETHING THAT WOULD HELP

01:01:38.061 --> 01:01:40.296
UTILITY FROM ACTUALLY HAVING TO

01:01:40.363 --> 01:01:42.832
IMPACT ITS DEBT EQUITY RATIO OF

01:01:42.899 --> 01:01:44.901
FORD'S NORMAL BUSINESS HOWEVER

01:01:44.967 --> 01:01:46.335
EVEN THAT CANNOT BE

01:01:46.402 --> 01:01:47.537
INEXHAUSTIBLE.

01:01:47.603 --> 01:01:49.539
YOU CAN'T DO THAT YEAR IN AND

01:01:49.605 --> 01:01:50.073
YEAR OUT I CAN'T TELL YOU

01:01:50.139 --> 01:01:51.007
EXACTLY.

01:01:51.074 --> 01:01:53.376
WHEN YOU REACH THE TIPPING POINT?

01:01:53.443 --> 01:01:54.143
BUT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT

01:01:54.210 --> 01:01:56.712
CANNOT BE SUSTAINED IN TERMS OF

01:01:56.779 --> 01:02:01.851
CONTINUING TO BORROWMONEY SO

01:02:01.918 --> 01:02:02.485
WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS OF ALL

01:02:02.552 --> 01:02:03.419
OF THIS.

01:02:03.486 --> 01:02:04.854
LOOKING AT THE SHEET WITH THE

01:02:04.921 --> 01:02:05.721
NUMBERS ONE THROUGH FVE WHICH

01:02:05.788 --> 01:02:07.323
IS -- FOR A THIRD FROM THE END.

01:02:07.390 --> 01:02:09.092
OF THE PATH.

01:02:09.158 --> 01:02:10.760
THE AND NOW IT IF IF THE RATES

01:02:10.827 --> 01:02:12.228
GO UP IS SIGNIFICANTLY AS WE'RE

01:02:12.295 --> 01:02:13.529
TALKING ABOUT HERE.

01:02:13.596 --> 01:02:15.098
OF COURSE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO DO

01:02:15.164 --> 01:02:16.299
TWO THINGS ARE GOING.

01:02:16.365 --> 01:02:18.301
TO FIND WAYS TO REDUCE THE

01:02:18.367 --> 01:02:18.901
AMOUNT OF POWER THAT THEY'RE

01:02:18.968 --> 01:02:21.604
USING FROM THE UTILITIES.

01:02:21.671 --> 01:02:23.106
NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO AND

01:02:23.172 --> 01:02:24.474
THEY'RE GONNA TRY TO AVOID AND

01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:25.808
CHANGING TO THINGS SUCH AS

01:02:25.875 --> 01:02:27.210
ELECTRIC VEHICLES OR

01:02:27.276 --> 01:02:29.512
ELECTRIFYING A HOME -- THAT.

01:02:29.579 --> 01:02:32.215
WOULD OTHERWISE OCCUR BECAUSE

01:02:32.281 --> 01:02:35.518
THE THE RATIO OF GASOLINE PRICES

01:02:35.585 --> 01:02:37.153
TO ELECTRIC PRICES OR NATURAL%

01:02:37.220 --> 01:02:38.754
GAS ELECTRICITY IS GOING TO

01:02:38.821 --> 01:02:40.089
CONTINUE TO LOOK AND FAVORABLE

01:02:40.156 --> 01:02:41.791
I'M SURE THAT COMMITTEE MEMBERS

01:02:41.858 --> 01:02:43.126

01:02:43.192 --> 01:02:44.260
QUESTIONS FOR YOU SURE.

01:02:44.327 --> 01:02:46.529

THAT.

01:02:48.731 --> 01:02:49.765
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MAY

01:02:49.832 --> 01:02:51.300

US THIS IS A HEARING ON A

01:03:36.479 --> 01:03:38.314

REGARDLESS OF WE PASS OR DID

01:03:42.919 --> 01:03:45.555
THEY MODIFY IF WE PASS THIS BILL.

01:03:45.621 --> 01:03:47.857

IMPACTED ALL BY THE PASSAGE OF

01:03:57.400 --> 01:03:59.335
THIS BILL YES IF YOU LOOK AT

01:03:59.402 --> 01:04:00.870
LOOK AT THE GRAPH THAT.

01:04:00.937 --> 01:04:03.706
THAT -- START ON THE FOURTH PAGE

01:04:03.773 --> 01:04:05.575
THE THE IN READ SHOW THE

01:04:05.641 --> 01:04:07.843
POTENTIAL INCREASES COMING UP

01:04:07.910 --> 01:04:09.312
FROM REPEATED WILD FIRES --

01:04:09.378 --> 01:04:12.949
THOSE.

01:04:13.015 --> 01:04:14.317
WOULD BE.

01:04:14.383 --> 01:04:16.419
THE SAME FOR A FOR RATE PAYERS --

01:04:16.485 --> 01:04:16.786
WHETHER.

01:04:16.852 --> 01:04:17.587
THERE'S A THERE'S A

01:04:17.653 --> 01:04:19.222
SECURITIZATION -- IT'S THE BILL

01:04:19.288 --> 01:04:21.924
WOULD WOULD ALLOW FOR OR WHETHER

01:04:21.991 --> 01:04:22.558
THERE WAS A STRAIGHT EFFORT TO

01:04:22.625 --> 01:04:23.526
BORROW.

01:04:23.593 --> 01:04:26.796
BORROW MORE FUNDS A SO SO THE SO

01:04:26.862 --> 01:04:28.731
TO THIS EXTENT OF THE THE GRASS

01:04:28.798 --> 01:04:30.132
WITH WITH THE SAME.

01:04:30.199 --> 01:04:31.567
WITH OR WITHOUT THE BILL WHEN

01:04:31.634 --> 01:04:33.135
YOU START TO CONSIDER -- THE

01:04:33.202 --> 01:04:36.706
IMPACTS ON THE FINANCIAL STATUS

01:04:36.772 --> 01:04:37.373
OF THE UTILITY.

01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:38.841
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT.

01:04:38.908 --> 01:04:40.343
THE BILL'S SECURITIZATION

01:04:40.409 --> 01:04:42.778
PROVISIONS WOULD PROBABLY BY THE

01:04:42.845 --> 01:04:45.848
UTILITY SOMETIME IN THE BE ABLE.

01:04:45.915 --> 01:04:47.350
TO TO CONTINUE TO BORROW MONEY

01:04:47.416 --> 01:04:47.984
FOR A WHILE BECAUSE THEY WOULD

01:04:48.050 --> 01:04:51.420
HAVE A GUARANTEED WAY TO PAY OFF

01:04:51.487 --> 01:04:53.222
THOSE PARTICULAR.

01:04:53.289 --> 01:04:55.591
METICULOUS -- OF BANDS BUT AGAIN

01:04:55.658 --> 01:04:57.193
IT'S NOT INEXHAUSTIBLE.

01:04:57.260 --> 01:04:59.262
OKAY A CENTER STERN.

01:04:59.328 --> 01:05:00.496
AMOS CHAIR I KNOW WE WANT TO

01:05:00.563 --> 01:05:01.931
MOVE ON TO THE BILL IN CHIEF I I

01:05:01.998 --> 01:05:02.632
JUST WANT TO GET THE SAME

01:05:02.698 --> 01:05:03.933
CLARITY I THINK THAT MY

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:04.967
COLLEAGUE WAS SEEKING

01:05:05.034 --> 01:05:05.268
[inaudible]

01:05:05.334 --> 01:05:06.936
PROFESSOR SO.

01:05:07.003 --> 01:05:10.873
THE THE RED BARS.

01:05:10.940 --> 01:05:12.508
ON TOP OF THE BLUE YES.

01:05:12.575 --> 01:05:15.578
IS WHAT HAPPENS TO UTILITY BILLS.

01:05:15.645 --> 01:05:17.613
IF WE DON'T PASS ANY LEGISLATION

01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:19.148
THIS IS THAT'S BUSINESS AS USUAL

01:05:19.215 --> 01:05:21.050
SCENARIO WITH THOSE SORT OF

01:05:21.117 --> 01:05:22.652
PROJECTED LOSSES RIGHT.

01:05:22.718 --> 01:05:25.354
THAT READ THAT INCREASE THE THE

01:05:25.421 --> 01:05:27.590
IF IF THERE ARE DO NOTHING TODAY

01:05:27.657 --> 01:05:29.058
AND IF WE WANT OF THAT I WILL

01:05:29.125 --> 01:05:31.961
COMBINE INCREASE THAT IF IT IF

01:05:32.028 --> 01:05:33.496
WE WIND UP HAVING.

01:05:33.562 --> 01:05:34.263
WILD FIRES LIKE WE DID THE LAST

01:05:34.330 --> 01:05:35.364
TOUR ASSUMING WE HAVE THE SAME

01:05:35.431 --> 01:05:36.699
KINDS OF WILDFIRES IT HAD FOR

01:05:36.766 --> 01:05:38.067
THE PAST FEW YEARS.

01:05:38.134 --> 01:05:40.236
THE THE BIG JUMP IN UTILITY RATE

01:05:40.303 --> 01:05:42.038
INCREASES ARE FROM WHAT WOULD

01:05:42.104 --> 01:05:44.373
HAPPEN WITHOUT THIS LEGISLATION

01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:44.674
[inaudible]

01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:49.178
NO.

01:05:49.245 --> 01:05:50.713
WHAT WERE?

01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:51.614
YOU THERE OR IF IT'S REASONABLE.

01:05:51.681 --> 01:05:53.282
MY SENSE WAS THAT THIS IS A

01:05:53.349 --> 01:05:56.719
BUSINESS AS USUAL PROJECTION.

01:05:56.786 --> 01:05:58.054
THIS IS A BUSINESS AS USUAL

01:05:58.120 --> 01:06:01.257
PROJECTION YES YES OKAY SO

01:06:01.324 --> 01:06:02.692
REGARDLESS OF THE BILL THIS IS

01:06:02.758 --> 01:06:04.260
GOING TO HAPPEN.

01:06:04.327 --> 01:06:05.461
NOT.

01:06:05.528 --> 01:06:07.029
IF IF WE WILL CONTINUE HAVE WILD

01:06:07.096 --> 01:06:08.497
FIRES IT IS THE RIGHT WE HAVE

01:06:08.564 --> 01:06:10.199
THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS.

01:06:10.266 --> 01:06:11.867
AND IF THOSE COSTS ARE PASSED ON

01:06:11.934 --> 01:06:13.202
THE RATE PAYERS YES.

01:06:13.269 --> 01:06:14.770
BUT THAT BUT THAT STILL DOESN'T

01:06:14.837 --> 01:06:16.305
ANSWER THE QUESTION YOU SO I

01:06:16.372 --> 01:06:17.873
ASKED DID ORIGINALLY AND THEN

HENRY ASKED FOR THE

01:06:18.974 --> 01:06:21.410
CLARIFICATION.

DO THESE GRAPHS.

01:06:22.745 --> 01:06:23.813
ARE THEY MODIFIED AT ALL FROM

01:06:23.879 --> 01:06:25.548
YOUR POINT OF VIEW IF WE PASS

01:06:25.614 --> 01:06:28.150
THIS BILL OR THESE GRAPHS GOING

01:06:28.217 --> 01:06:30.720
TO STAY THE SAME REGARDLESS.

01:06:30.786 --> 01:06:32.722
OF THIS BILL'S PASSAGE.

01:06:34.857 --> 01:06:35.891
ME THAT THE BILL ACTUALLY.

01:06:35.958 --> 01:06:38.427
WOULD TEMPER THIS TO SOME EXTENT

01:06:38.494 --> 01:06:40.062
BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE FUND -- BUT

01:06:40.129 --> 01:06:41.731
IT HAS THE UTILITIES HAVE TO

01:06:41.797 --> 01:06:43.399
REPAY THE FUND THEY HAVE TO GET

01:06:43.466 --> 01:06:44.066
THAT MONEY FROM SOMEWHERE AND SO

01:06:44.133 --> 01:06:44.700
THAT.

01:06:44.767 --> 01:06:45.568
THE QUESTIONS ARE GOING TO BE

01:06:45.634 --> 01:06:48.371
HOW HOW THAT WILL ULTIMATELY.

01:06:48.437 --> 01:06:50.039
CONTRIBUTE TO RATE INCREASES

01:06:50.106 --> 01:06:51.907
SUCH LATER IF WE COULD MAYBE

01:06:51.974 --> 01:06:54.043
WITH WE ALLOW OUR TECHNICAL

01:06:54.110 --> 01:06:56.879
SUPPORT THE TO RESPOND I THINK

01:06:56.946 --> 01:06:58.547
IT WILL BE CLEAR THAT THESE.

01:06:58.614 --> 01:06:59.782
ARE COSTS ARE GOING TO HAVE THE

01:06:59.849 --> 01:07:01.250
KIND OF IMPACT IT'S BEING

01:07:01.317 --> 01:07:02.351
DESCRIBED.

01:07:02.418 --> 01:07:04.186
IF IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY AND

01:07:04.253 --> 01:07:05.855
DOCTOR WISEMAN CORRECT ME IF I'M

01:07:05.921 --> 01:07:07.256
WRONG USUALLY THIS IS TO THE

01:07:07.323 --> 01:07:08.257
MIKE SORRY -- CORRECT ME IF I'M

01:07:08.324 --> 01:07:09.925
WRONG BUT THIS IS ILLUSTRATING

01:07:09.992 --> 01:07:11.560
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF COST

01:07:11.627 --> 01:07:14.397
RECOVERY WERE ALLOWED ON DAY.

01:07:14.463 --> 01:07:15.765
ONE AND IF THE WILDFIRES

01:07:15.831 --> 01:07:17.433
CONTINUE AT THE CURRENT RATE SO

01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:20.636
IT'S ASSUMING COST RECOVERY --

01:07:20.703 --> 01:07:22.338
YOU KNOW SIMILAR TO YOU BUT IT

01:07:22.405 --> 01:07:23.672
IT'S WE CONSUMING MEDIA COST

01:07:23.739 --> 01:07:25.408
RECOVERY THAT'S ASSUMING THAT

01:07:25.474 --> 01:07:26.642
THE RISK IN THE SIZE OF

01:07:26.709 --> 01:07:27.843
WILDFIRES CONTINUE.

01:07:27.910 --> 01:07:29.245
ON THOUGH THE MEASURE THERE

01:07:29.311 --> 01:07:32.415
WOULD BE NO COST RECOVERY ON DAY

01:07:32.481 --> 01:07:34.216
ONE THAT THE FUND WOULD PROVIDE

01:07:34.283 --> 01:07:35.284
UP TO FORTY BILLION DOLLARS OF

01:07:35.351 --> 01:07:37.887
CLAIMS CLAIMS PAYING RESOURCES --

01:07:37.953 --> 01:07:39.488
THOSE RESOURCES OF THE TEN AND A

01:07:39.555 --> 01:07:40.556
HALF BILLION DOLLARS A WILL COME

01:07:40.623 --> 01:07:42.024
WITH UTILITIES COULD NOT BE

01:07:42.091 --> 01:07:44.059
RECOVERED FROM -- REPAIR A FROM

01:07:44.126 --> 01:07:46.829
REPAIRS THE THE ADDITIONAL CAP

01:07:46.896 --> 01:07:48.364
ON THE PAY OUTS WOULD PROVIDE

01:07:48.431 --> 01:07:49.331
ADDITIONAL CLAIMS BEING

01:07:49.398 --> 01:07:50.666
RESOURCES WITHOUT A DIME FROM

01:07:50.733 --> 01:07:51.801
RATEPAYERS.

01:07:51.867 --> 01:07:52.835
THE TEN AND A HALF BILLION

01:07:52.902 --> 01:07:54.170
DOLLARS A COME FROM RAY PERSONS

01:07:54.236 --> 01:07:55.571
FROM CONTINUATION OF CHARGES

01:07:55.638 --> 01:07:57.139
THAT FOLKS ARE CURRENTLY PAYING.

01:07:57.206 --> 01:07:59.041
DURING THAT PERIOD THAT WOULD BE

01:07:59.108 --> 01:08:00.709
THE BENEFIT OF THE FIVE BILLION

01:08:00.776 --> 01:08:03.446
DOLLARS PLUS OF INVESTMENTS IN

01:08:03.512 --> 01:08:05.247
HARDENING THE INFRASTRUCTURE AS

01:08:05.314 --> 01:08:07.817
WELL AS THE TIME FOR THE

01:08:07.883 --> 01:08:08.784
INVESTMENTS OF THE STATE IS

01:08:08.851 --> 01:08:10.986
MAKING RELATIVE TO REDUCING THE

01:08:11.053 --> 01:08:12.288
RISK AND FREQUENCY OF WILDFIRES.

01:08:12.354 --> 01:08:14.089
SO THAT THE NOTION HERE IS

01:08:14.156 --> 01:08:16.425
THERE'S FORTY MILLION DOLLARS OF

01:08:16.492 --> 01:08:18.127
OF CLAIMS PAYING RESOURCES TO

01:08:18.194 --> 01:08:19.862
PROVIDE THE BRIDGE FOR THE

01:08:19.929 --> 01:08:20.996
MITIGATION EFFORTS TO COME INTO

01:08:21.063 --> 01:08:23.098
EFFECT. TO MAKE IT SO THAT THESE

01:08:23.165 --> 01:08:25.234
RATE INCREASES THAT WOULD GO

01:08:25.301 --> 01:08:27.770
INTO EFFECT IF COSTS ARE BEING.

01:08:27.837 --> 01:08:29.271
PASSED ON IN WILDFIRES CONTINUE

01:08:29.338 --> 01:08:36.512
AT THAT RISK WOULD NOT OCCUR SO

01:08:36.579 --> 01:08:37.680
THIS IS THE STATUS QUO SCENARIO.

01:08:37.746 --> 01:08:38.714
UNDER THE MEASURE THAT WOULD BE

01:08:38.781 --> 01:08:39.849
THE FUN PROVIDING CLEAN FRAME

01:08:39.915 --> 01:08:40.149
RESOURCES.

01:08:40.216 --> 01:08:40.783
THERE WOULD BE THE INVESTMENTS

01:08:40.850 --> 01:08:41.417
IN MITIGATION AND ON HARDENING

01:08:41.484 --> 01:08:42.184
AND OTHER ELEMENTS TO REDUCE THE

01:08:42.251 --> 01:08:44.386
RISK -- TO TO ENSURE THAT THERE

01:08:44.453 --> 01:08:45.488
THERE ARE CLAIMS PAYING

01:08:45.554 --> 01:08:46.956
RESOURCES BUT WITHOUT THE

01:08:47.022 --> 01:08:49.992
NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON REPAIRS THAT

01:08:50.059 --> 01:08:52.261
WOULD HAPPEN UNDER CURRENT LAW.

01:08:52.328 --> 01:08:53.395
BUT JUST TO PUT A FINER POINT I

01:08:53.462 --> 01:08:54.964
APPRECIATE THE DETAIL.

01:08:55.030 --> 01:08:56.599
THIS IS A BUSINESS AS USUAL

01:08:56.665 --> 01:08:58.467
SCENARIO BEING PROJECTED.

01:08:58.534 --> 01:08:59.768
THAT WOULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY

01:08:59.835 --> 01:09:01.136
MITIGATED.

01:09:01.203 --> 01:09:03.439
UNDER YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF THIS

01:09:03.506 --> 01:09:04.073
TEN FIFTY FOUR FRAMEWORK FOR THE

01:09:04.139 --> 01:09:05.040
RED.

01:09:05.107 --> 01:09:06.842
GETS CHOPPED DOWN AND THE ONLY

01:09:06.909 --> 01:09:08.544
QUESTION IS HOW MUCH DOES THE

01:09:08.611 --> 01:09:09.712
ACTUALLY GET CHOPPED DOWN IS

01:09:09.778 --> 01:09:11.247
THAT A FAIR.

01:09:11.313 --> 01:09:13.916
SUMMARY YES AND ALSO CAN INTO

01:09:13.983 --> 01:09:15.584
THE MODEL YEAH YOU CAN AND SORRY

01:09:15.651 --> 01:09:17.419
YES THAT THAT IS A FAIR SUMMARY

01:09:17.486 --> 01:09:19.421
AND THEN THE PIECES ALSO THAT

01:09:19.488 --> 01:09:20.689
HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE FOR THE

01:09:20.756 --> 01:09:22.424
MITIGATION TO AFFECTS OF THE RED

01:09:22.491 --> 01:09:23.626
DOES NOT HAPPEN AT ALL.

01:09:23.692 --> 01:09:25.394
RIGHT BECAUSE THE UNDERLYING

01:09:25.461 --> 01:09:26.829
ASSUMPTION OF BUSINESS AS USUAL

01:09:26.896 --> 01:09:29.064
IS BASICALLY A DOOMSDAY SCENARIO

01:09:29.131 --> 01:09:30.766
OF CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES AFTER

01:09:30.833 --> 01:09:32.301
CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES TO

01:09:32.368 --> 01:09:33.769
CATASTROPHIC WHAT FOR THAT'S

01:09:33.836 --> 01:09:34.737
THAT'S THE BASIS OF YOUR

01:09:34.803 --> 01:09:37.640
ASSUMPTION CORRECT PROFESSOR YES

01:09:37.706 --> 01:09:37.840
OKAY.

01:09:37.907 --> 01:09:42.144
THANK YOU -- WE'RE GONNA SENATOR --

01:09:42.211 --> 01:09:43.612
WE HAD -- WITH CENTER HERTZBERG

01:09:43.679 --> 01:09:44.813
AN OF MORE LIKE IT'S FIRST IN

01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:47.249
HERTZBERG [inaudible]

01:09:47.316 --> 01:09:48.651
RUBIO.

01:09:48.717 --> 01:09:51.186
THANK YOU MISTER WELCOME BACK.

01:09:51.253 --> 01:09:53.822
I'M.

01:09:53.889 --> 01:09:55.057
JUST TRYING TO KEEP THE SHOW

01:09:55.124 --> 01:09:57.059
BRIEF -- THAN A REVIEWING THE

01:09:57.126 --> 01:09:58.360
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR P.

01:09:58.427 --> 01:10:00.729
JEANNIE -- THEY'VE ADDED SOME

01:10:00.796 --> 01:10:01.697
THIRTY FOUR BILLION IN

01:10:01.764 --> 01:10:03.132
LIABILITIES TO THEIR BALANCE

01:10:03.198 --> 01:10:04.233
SHEET.

01:10:04.300 --> 01:10:07.970
FOR THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN TWENTY

01:10:08.037 --> 01:10:08.737
EIGHTEEN FIRES IN THEIR VICTIMS

01:10:08.804 --> 01:10:10.172
AND SO TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW

01:10:10.239 --> 01:10:11.707
IS THAT PAID OFF -- THEY

01:10:11.774 --> 01:10:13.842
GENERATE ABOUT. SEVENTEEN

01:10:13.909 --> 01:10:15.978
BILLION A YEAR IN REVENUES AND

01:10:16.045 --> 01:10:18.247
ABOUT TWO BILLION A YEAR AND NET

01:10:18.314 --> 01:10:19.214
INCOME.

01:10:19.281 --> 01:10:20.649
WHICH HALF OF THAT GOES TO

01:10:20.716 --> 01:10:22.051
DIVIDEND SO THEY'RE JUST A

01:10:22.117 --> 01:10:23.619
LITTLE BIT OF PLAYING ROOM HERE --

01:10:23.686 --> 01:10:25.154
WHEN YOU WHEN YOU HAVE A UTILITY

01:10:25.220 --> 01:10:26.622
YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE LIMITED ON

01:10:26.689 --> 01:10:27.790
WHAT YOU CAN CHARGE?

01:10:27.856 --> 01:10:32.027
SO I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT --

01:10:32.094 --> 01:10:33.128
ONE YOU KNOW HOW HEY PAY OFF

01:10:33.195 --> 01:10:34.563
THE VICTIMS WHICH THEY COULD DO

01:10:34.630 --> 01:10:36.165
THROUGH A THIRTY YEAR.

01:10:36.231 --> 01:10:37.633
DAD I'M SURE AND THEN THAT WOULD

01:10:37.700 --> 01:10:39.969
COST THEM OF ABOUT ONE POINT TWO

01:10:40.035 --> 01:10:41.303
ONE POINT THREE BILLION A YEAR.

01:10:41.370 --> 01:10:42.972
GET A GOOD INTEREST RATE. TO PAY

01:10:43.038 --> 01:10:44.106
THEM OFF SO THAT DOESN'T LEAVE

01:10:44.173 --> 01:10:47.009
MUCH ROOM WITH NET INCOME TO

01:10:47.076 --> 01:10:48.844
HAVE CASH FOR OTHER THINGS I'M.

01:10:48.911 --> 01:10:49.411
I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW

01:10:49.478 --> 01:10:52.181
WOULD THEY PARTICIPATE IN THE

01:10:52.247 --> 01:10:53.215
FIVE BILLION DOLLARS OF

01:10:53.282 --> 01:10:55.284
INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS.

01:10:55.351 --> 01:10:56.986
HOW WOULD THEY PARTICIPATE IN?

01:10:57.052 --> 01:10:59.788
MAKING CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE FUND.

01:10:59.855 --> 01:11:01.724
AND THEY HAVE TO BE NEUTRAL WITH

01:11:01.790 --> 01:11:03.425
TACT WITH RATE PAYERS AND THEY

01:11:03.492 --> 01:11:04.860
HAVE TO KEEP THEIR EMPLOYEES SO

01:11:04.927 --> 01:11:05.060
I'M.

01:11:05.127 --> 01:11:06.895
I'M SEEING ALL KINDS OF TOP WALL

01:11:06.962 --> 01:11:08.764
SO MAYBE I COULD ASK YOU THE

01:11:08.831 --> 01:11:11.767
SAME NUMBER HOLDEN HOW HOW IS.

01:11:11.834 --> 01:11:12.768
HOW IS UTILITY GOING?

01:11:12.835 --> 01:11:15.337
TO FULFILL WHAT WE'RE ASKING

01:11:15.404 --> 01:11:17.573
THEM TO DO WITH THIS BILL.

01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:19.041
WELL A RIB REMEMBER THAT P.

01:11:19.108 --> 01:11:20.175
JEANNIE CURRENTLY IS IN

01:11:20.242 --> 01:11:21.510
BANKRUPTCY AND SO THEY HAVE TO

01:11:21.577 --> 01:11:24.113
GO THROUGH A PROCESS OF BEING

01:11:24.179 --> 01:11:25.347
ABLE TO GET.

01:11:25.414 --> 01:11:27.082
A PLAN IN PLACE THAT ALLOWS THEM

01:11:27.149 --> 01:11:28.550
TO MOVE FORWARD AND ULTIMATELY

01:11:28.617 --> 01:11:30.119
BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS

01:11:30.185 --> 01:11:32.087
FUND -- I THINK THAT THE

01:11:32.154 --> 01:11:34.757
EXPECTATION IS THAT.

01:11:34.823 --> 01:11:37.760
AS THE THE GENIE REPRESENTING

01:11:37.826 --> 01:11:38.527
MAYBE.

01:11:38.594 --> 01:11:40.029
IT YET AS A MEMBER HOLDEN I

01:11:40.095 --> 01:11:41.296
THINK -- NANCY -- AT THE

01:11:41.363 --> 01:11:42.264
MITCHELL CAN ANSWER HAT

01:11:42.331 --> 01:11:45.868
QUESTION -- AND MAYBE PROVIDE

01:11:45.934 --> 01:11:52.975
SOME INSIGHT IF THAT'S OKAY.

01:11:53.042 --> 01:11:53.909
SO I AM NANCY MITCHELL FROM A

01:11:53.976 --> 01:11:55.177
MOMENT IN MYERS FOR THE

01:11:55.244 --> 01:11:56.378
ADMINISTRATION.

01:11:56.445 --> 01:11:57.913
I'M WITH REGARD TO YOUR QUESTION --

01:11:57.980 --> 01:12:00.349
CENTER MY LACKEY THE BANKRUPTCY

01:12:00.416 --> 01:12:02.885
PROCESS WILL RESULT IN SOME RE

01:12:02.951 --> 01:12:05.054
CAPITALIZATION OF P. JEANNIE.

01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:07.089
AND THAT WILL BE DONE THROUGH

01:12:07.156 --> 01:12:08.991
THE BANKRUPTCY PROCESS UNDER THE

01:12:09.058 --> 01:12:09.858
AUSPICES OF BANKRUPTCY COURT.

01:12:09.925 --> 01:12:11.427
I WOULD EXPECT THAT THAT MAY

01:12:11.493 --> 01:12:13.028
REQUIRE EITHER A SIGNIFICANT

01:12:13.095 --> 01:12:14.963
INVESTMENT BY THE SHAREHOLDERS

01:12:15.030 --> 01:12:16.498
TO SORT OF BY FUTURE.

01:12:16.565 --> 01:12:18.434
PROFITS OR A RE CAPITALIZATION

01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:19.601
OF THE COMPANY IN WHICH THE

01:12:19.668 --> 01:12:21.370
EXISTING DEBT MAY BE TURNED INTO

01:12:21.437 --> 01:12:23.305
EQUITY IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THE

01:12:23.372 --> 01:12:24.373
ROOM THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:12:24.440 --> 01:12:25.307
FOR THE INVESTMENTS.

01:12:25.374 --> 01:12:26.175
SO I THINK IF THERE A LOT OF

01:12:26.241 --> 01:12:27.543
OPPORTUNITIES IN THE BANKRUPTCY

01:12:27.609 --> 01:12:29.445
CONTEXT TO RECAPITALIZE IN A WAY

01:12:29.511 --> 01:12:31.080
THAT WILL ALLOW THEM TO DO THAT.

01:12:31.146 --> 01:12:33.749
SO WE RE CAPITALIZE WE'RE GONNA

01:12:33.816 --> 01:12:34.950
DILUTED SHARES TO THE CURRENT

01:12:35.017 --> 01:12:36.785
SHAREHOLDERS AND WE'RE GOING TO

01:12:36.852 --> 01:12:38.620
CONVERT BONDS TO EQUITY COULD

01:12:38.687 --> 01:12:39.154
HAVE BEEN.

01:12:39.221 --> 01:12:41.123
THE WE ARE ARE WE ASKING BOND

01:12:41.190 --> 01:12:42.424
HOLDERS TO TAKE A HAIR CUT WELL

01:12:42.491 --> 01:12:43.525
THE BOND HOLDERS OF ALREADY MADE

01:12:43.592 --> 01:12:45.260
A PROPOSAL IN THE BANKRUPTCY

01:12:45.327 --> 01:12:46.929
ACTUALLY THAT WOULD ALLOW THAT

01:12:46.995 --> 01:12:47.496
TO HAPPEN.

01:12:47.563 --> 01:12:48.797
BUT I DON'T THINK YOUR BILL PUTS

01:12:48.864 --> 01:12:50.099
THE FINGER ON THAT PARTICULAR

01:12:50.165 --> 01:12:51.967
SCALE THERE ARE AT LEAST THREE

01:12:52.034 --> 01:12:53.402
WAYS TO EXIT BANKRUPTCY THE

01:12:53.469 --> 01:12:55.237
EXISTING EQUITY CAN PONY UP THE

01:12:55.304 --> 01:12:56.238
CASH.

01:12:56.305 --> 01:12:58.340
THE EXISTING DEBT CAN CONVERT TO

01:12:58.407 --> 01:12:59.908
EQUITY OR THE COMPANY COULD BE

01:12:59.975 --> 01:13:01.443
SOLD TO SOMEONE ELSE WHO WANTED

01:13:01.510 --> 01:13:02.911
TO PAY THE CLAIMS THAT THE

01:13:02.978 --> 01:13:04.279
STATUTE REQUIRES THEM TO PAY.

01:13:04.346 --> 01:13:05.981
IN ANY OF THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES

01:13:06.048 --> 01:13:07.783
THE COMPANY WOULD EXIT UNDER THE

01:13:07.850 --> 01:13:10.786
PARAMETERS THAT THE U. OF PUT IN

01:13:10.853 --> 01:13:11.353
THE STATUTE.

01:13:11.420 --> 01:13:12.321
SO.

01:13:12.387 --> 01:13:13.122
MISS MITCHELL I I SEE THE THE

01:13:13.188 --> 01:13:15.824
EFFICACY OF THE BILL BUT I SEE

01:13:15.891 --> 01:13:16.992
THAT IT TAKES CARE OF TODAY'S

01:13:17.059 --> 01:13:17.659
PROBLEMS AND I'M WONDERING.

01:13:17.726 --> 01:13:19.027
WHAT WE DO?

01:13:19.094 --> 01:13:22.464
WHEN THERE'S AN ENCORE?

01:13:22.531 --> 01:13:24.366
WHAT IT HOW DO WE HOW DO WE

01:13:24.433 --> 01:13:25.134
SQUEEZE BUT OUT OF A TURNIP BUT

01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:25.934
I'M?

01:13:26.001 --> 01:13:28.270
THAT'S WHERE I'M KIND OF

01:13:28.337 --> 01:13:30.372
SEARCHING FOR FOR REMEDY THE

01:13:30.439 --> 01:13:31.974
FROM THE BANKRUPTCY PROCESS THE

01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:33.242
JUDGE WILL HAVE TO DETERMINE

01:13:33.308 --> 01:13:34.543
THAT THE PLAN IS FEASIBLE THE

01:13:34.610 --> 01:13:35.844
FEDERAL JUDGE WILL HAVE TO

01:13:35.911 --> 01:13:36.578
DETERMINE THAT THE PLAN IS

01:13:36.645 --> 01:13:37.212
FEASIBLE.

01:13:37.279 --> 01:13:38.714
WHICH UNDER THE BANKRUPTCY CODE

01:13:38.781 --> 01:13:39.815
REQUIRES THE JUDGE TO MAKE A

01:13:39.882 --> 01:13:41.383
DETERMINATION THAT IT WILL NOT

01:13:41.450 --> 01:13:42.618
BE FOLLOWED BY A SUBSEQUENT

01:13:42.684 --> 01:13:43.619
REORGANIZATION.

01:13:43.685 --> 01:13:44.853
AND SO THEY WILL HAVE TO PUT A

01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:47.689
PLAN IN PLACE THAT PROVIDES ROOM

01:13:47.756 --> 01:13:49.158
FOR A FEASIBLE OPTION OF FOR

01:13:49.224 --> 01:13:50.659
FEASIBLE OPERATIONS GOING

01:13:50.726 --> 01:13:53.028
FORWARD IN ORDER TO EXIT THAT

01:13:53.095 --> 01:13:54.163
THE BANKRUPTCY PROCESS AND

01:13:54.229 --> 01:13:56.231
THAT'S JUST A REQUIREMENT OF

01:13:56.298 --> 01:13:56.965
ELEVEN TWENTY NINE OF THE

01:13:57.032 --> 01:13:58.734
BANKRUPTCY CODE -- THE JUDGE

01:13:58.801 --> 01:14:00.102
WILL HAVE TO MAKE THAT FINDING

01:14:00.169 --> 01:14:01.603
ON A GOING FORWARD BASIS THEY

01:14:01.670 --> 01:14:02.905
WILL HAVE TO LIVE WITHIN THE THE

01:14:02.971 --> 01:14:04.573
PARAMETERS OF THE STATUTE.

01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:07.009
THE THE CHANGES TO THE STATUTE

01:14:07.075 --> 01:14:08.744
ALSO PROVIDE THEM SUPPORT IN

01:14:08.811 --> 01:14:10.078
TERMS OF THE USE OF THE FUND

01:14:10.145 --> 01:14:11.180
DOLLARS.

01:14:11.246 --> 01:14:12.815
TO CUT OFF THE RED LINE IS AS

01:14:12.881 --> 01:14:14.249
YOU GUYS WERE DISCUSSING EARLIER

01:14:14.316 --> 01:14:15.651
AND ASSUMING THAT THE MITIGATION

01:14:15.717 --> 01:14:17.286
EFFORTS TO DO TAKE HOLD.

01:14:17.352 --> 01:14:18.620
THEIR PLAN WILL BE BASED ON A

01:14:18.687 --> 01:14:20.122
HOLISTIC LOOK AT WHAT THEY NEED

01:14:20.189 --> 01:14:21.390
TO RECAPITALIZE GOING FORWARD

01:14:21.456 --> 01:14:24.493
AND THEY WILL HAVE TO MAKE THAT

01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:25.494
CASE TO THE BANKRUPTCY JUDGE.

01:14:25.561 --> 01:14:26.395
A BANKRUPTCY JUDGE WOULD.

01:14:26.461 --> 01:14:28.864
RESPECT A NEW BILL.

01:14:28.931 --> 01:14:31.600
LIKE THIS ONE OR IS THAT I DON'T

01:14:31.667 --> 01:14:32.768
REALLY THINK THE FEDERAL JUDGE

01:14:32.835 --> 01:14:34.403
HAS ANY CHOICE BUT YES I ALSO

01:14:34.469 --> 01:14:36.038
THINK THAT HE WILL IT IS A IT IS

01:14:36.104 --> 01:14:38.273
A REGULATORY CONSTRUCT IT IS PUT

01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:41.210
IN PLACE BY THE STATE -- HE IS.

01:14:41.276 --> 01:14:43.245
TO RESPECT STATE LAW WITH REGARD

01:14:43.312 --> 01:14:44.646
TO REGULATORY ISSUES.

01:14:44.713 --> 01:14:46.148
THANK YOU MSS MITCHELL THANK

01:14:58.293 --> 01:15:01.296
HE COULD FOR A MOMENT.

01:15:01.363 --> 01:15:03.065
I CAN PUT A FINER POINT ON THE

01:15:03.131 --> 01:15:04.500
FINE POINTS A SINISTER INPUT

01:15:04.566 --> 01:15:05.901
ACCORDING TO THIS CHART.

01:15:05.968 --> 01:15:09.271
THAT THE PROFESSOR PROVIDED US

01:15:09.338 --> 01:15:09.872
FOR THE PUBLIC THE DOESN'T SEE

01:15:09.938 --> 01:15:10.572
IT.

01:15:10.639 --> 01:15:12.274
BASICALLY TEN YEARS OUT UNDER

01:15:12.341 --> 01:15:14.509
HIS -- STATUS QUO SCENARIO THAT

01:15:14.576 --> 01:15:16.545
WE DO A DO NOTHING STRATEGY.

01:15:16.612 --> 01:15:18.213
THE BILLS FOR P. JEANNIE I WOULD

01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:20.082
AVERAGE GO FROM AN AVERAGE OF A

01:15:20.148 --> 01:15:21.049
HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO DOLLARS A

01:15:21.116 --> 01:15:22.985
MONTH TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY TWO

01:15:23.051 --> 01:15:25.153
DOLLARS A MONTH -- IT WOULD BE

01:15:25.220 --> 01:15:26.355
THE INCREASE OF A HUNDRED AND

01:15:26.421 --> 01:15:27.856
TEN DOLLARS A MONTH ON AVERAGE

01:15:27.923 --> 01:15:29.524
BILLS BASED UPON THE DO NOTHING

01:15:29.591 --> 01:15:30.993
SCENARIO.

01:15:31.059 --> 01:15:33.695
THE SCENARIOS OUTLINED IN A IN A

01:15:33.762 --> 01:15:35.364
BE.

01:15:35.430 --> 01:15:36.164
TEN FIFTY FOUR AS YOU CORRECTLY

01:15:36.231 --> 01:15:37.532
NOTED I JUST WANNA MAKES MORE

01:15:37.599 --> 01:15:40.602
SPECIFICITY ON IT -- REQUIRES

01:15:40.669 --> 01:15:42.571
BEFORE ANY OF THE INVESTOR OWNED

01:15:42.638 --> 01:15:45.207
UTILITIES HAVE ACCESS TO THIS

01:15:45.274 --> 01:15:46.608
INSURANCE FUNDED THEY HAVE TO

01:15:46.675 --> 01:15:48.543
INVEST FIVE BILLION DOLLARS AND

01:15:48.610 --> 01:15:50.812
SO AS A CONSEQUENCE THERE'S GOOD

01:15:50.879 --> 01:15:52.047
ADDITION TO ANYTHING THAT THE

01:15:52.114 --> 01:15:53.415
STATE ALREADY DOES.

01:15:53.482 --> 01:15:55.384
THIS BILL REQUIRES FIVE BILLION

01:15:55.450 --> 01:15:57.085
DOLLARS IN HARDENING BY THE

01:15:57.152 --> 01:15:59.121
INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES SO THAT

01:15:59.187 --> 01:16:01.290
THE POTENTIAL RISK OF FIRE WHICH

01:16:01.356 --> 01:16:03.625
IS PRESUPPOSED IN THIS CHART.

01:16:03.692 --> 01:16:05.527
GOES IS RUDE IS MEDICAID IS THAT

01:16:05.594 --> 01:16:07.062
CORRECT THAT'S CORRECT AND

01:16:07.129 --> 01:16:09.064
SECONDLY THE OTHER THING THAT IT

01:16:09.131 --> 01:16:11.166
DOES IS BY CREATING THIS THIS

01:16:11.233 --> 01:16:13.468
FONDA -- IT IT IN INSTEAD OF

01:16:13.535 --> 01:16:15.404
HAVING INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES

01:16:15.470 --> 01:16:17.306
UNDER THE CURRENT STRUCTURE OF

01:16:17.372 --> 01:16:19.341
OF INVERSE CONDEMNATION CREATES

01:16:19.408 --> 01:16:20.976
A FUND HALF WHICH IS CONTRIBUTED

01:16:21.043 --> 01:16:23.011
PRESUMABLY BY VIRTUE OF OF THE

01:16:23.078 --> 01:16:24.379
QUESTION THAT WAS JUST ANSWERED

01:16:24.446 --> 01:16:25.747
OF OF SICK.

01:16:25.814 --> 01:16:27.516
OF ADDITIONAL EQUITY PROVIDED BY

01:16:27.582 --> 01:16:29.017
THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES

01:16:29.084 --> 01:16:31.320
HALF BY THIS BY THE SHAREHOLDERS.

01:16:31.386 --> 01:16:33.455
OR OR INVESTORS IN HALF BY RATE

01:16:33.522 --> 01:16:34.556
PAYERS.

01:16:34.623 --> 01:16:36.758
OF AND THAT THEN FURTHER REDUCES

01:16:36.825 --> 01:16:38.927
ANY POTENTIAL RISK OF INCREASE

01:16:38.994 --> 01:16:41.096
BECAUSE OUR ON THAT WILL BE

01:16:41.163 --> 01:16:43.365
TAKEN UP BY BY THE FUND CORRECT

01:16:43.432 --> 01:16:44.666
RIGHT AND FURTHER.

01:16:44.733 --> 01:16:46.168
THE UNDER THE FRONT MODEL THAT

01:16:46.234 --> 01:16:48.737
YOU STRUCTURED IN A BE UP IN.

01:16:48.804 --> 01:16:52.274
THE IN THE MEASURE WAS A FIFTY

01:16:52.341 --> 01:16:52.874
FOUR EIGHT TEN FIFTY FOUR WHAT

01:16:52.941 --> 01:16:54.042
HAPPENS IS THERE'S A HAIR CUT ON

01:16:54.109 --> 01:16:55.510
THE FRONT END SUBROGATION SO

01:16:55.577 --> 01:16:57.012
THAT FURTHER TAKES A SMALLER

01:16:57.079 --> 01:16:58.680
AMOUNT OF MONEY TO BE ABLE TO

01:16:58.747 --> 01:17:00.015
PROVIDE LARGER.

01:17:00.082 --> 01:17:01.550
RISK LIVE PROTECTION FOR RISK

01:17:01.616 --> 01:17:02.884
LIABILITY IN THE FUND IS THAT

01:17:02.951 --> 01:17:04.086
CORRECT ALSO THAT'S GREAT SO YOU

01:17:04.152 --> 01:17:05.320
REDUCE THE SIZE OF THE RISKY

01:17:05.387 --> 01:17:07.823
REDUCE THE SIZE OF OF FIRE RISK.

01:17:07.889 --> 01:17:09.624
YOU'VE CREATED OF A FIREWALL SO

01:17:09.691 --> 01:17:11.960
TO SPEAK TO PROTECT RATE PAYERS

01:17:12.027 --> 01:17:12.894
AND THE LAST THING I WANT TO

01:17:12.961 --> 01:17:14.396
MAKE IN TERMS OF THE MOST RECENT

01:17:14.463 --> 01:17:15.630
AMENDMENTS I BELIEVE THAT

01:17:15.697 --> 01:17:16.698
OCCURRED WITH RESPECT TO THIS

01:17:16.765 --> 01:17:16.965
MEASURE.

01:17:17.032 --> 01:17:19.701
IS THAT YOU HAVE PRIORITIZED

01:17:19.768 --> 01:17:21.436
SHAREHOLDER MONEY SO THAT IN THE

01:17:21.503 --> 01:17:22.337
EVENT THAT THERE IS A HORRIBLE

01:17:22.404 --> 01:17:24.539
FIRE THE FIRST MONEY THAT GOES

01:17:24.606 --> 01:17:26.008
OUT OF THAT INSURANCE FUND IS

01:17:26.074 --> 01:17:27.409
NOT RATE PAYER MONEY BUT A

01:17:27.476 --> 01:17:28.510
SHAREHOLDER MONEY CORRECT.

01:17:28.577 --> 01:17:29.244
THAT'S CORRECT AND THE TWO

01:17:29.311 --> 01:17:30.645
DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS ON

01:17:30.712 --> 01:17:31.980
AVERAGE THAT WILL BE CONTINUED

01:17:32.047 --> 01:17:34.783
FROM TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY

01:17:34.850 --> 01:17:36.952
FIFTY IS ACTUALLY PAID OUT UNTIL.

01:17:37.019 --> 01:17:41.757
AND BONDS ACTUALLY ISSUED UNTIL

01:17:41.823 --> 01:17:42.391
THERE'S ACTUALLY DEMAND FOR THE

01:17:42.457 --> 01:17:43.692
MONEY.

01:17:43.759 --> 01:17:44.393
OF THE BONDS GET ISSUE TO

01:17:44.459 --> 01:17:45.260
CAPITALIZE THE FUND THE THE THE

01:17:45.327 --> 01:17:46.228
FRONT AND IS GENERALLY THE

01:17:46.294 --> 01:17:48.163
EXPECTATION BUT AS YOU MENTIONED

01:17:48.230 --> 01:17:49.531
THE FUNDS WOULD BE ADMINISTERED

01:17:49.598 --> 01:17:51.433
IN A WAY TO HAVE THE RATE PAYERS

01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:51.967
I'M SORRY THE SHAREHOLDER

01:17:52.034 --> 01:17:54.002
DOLLARS -- BE PAYING FOR CLAIMS

01:17:54.069 --> 01:17:55.604
FIRST WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET TO

01:17:55.670 --> 01:17:57.005
IS THE POINT THAT SENATOR STERN

01:17:57.072 --> 01:17:58.607
WAS MAKING JUST ADD A FINER

01:17:58.673 --> 01:18:00.542
POINT TWO IS FINER POINT.

01:18:00.609 --> 01:18:01.877
IS THAT THERE IS A DRAMATIC

01:18:01.943 --> 01:18:03.879
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT THE

01:18:03.945 --> 01:18:05.847
STATUS QUO WOULD BE IN THE EVENT

01:18:05.914 --> 01:18:07.249
WE CONTINUE TO HAVE FIRES AND WE

01:18:07.315 --> 01:18:08.483
CAN DID NOTHING.

01:18:08.550 --> 01:18:09.985
VERSES WHAT WE'RE DOING AS A

01:18:10.052 --> 01:18:11.319
RESULT OF THIS MEASURE

01:18:11.386 --> 01:18:13.121
ABSOLUTELY INCLUDING ALSO THE

01:18:13.188 --> 01:18:14.456
FACT THAT THE MEASURE WOULD

01:18:14.523 --> 01:18:17.426
PROHIBIT -- UTILITIES FROM BEING

01:18:17.492 --> 01:18:19.194
ABLE TO EARN A PROFIT.

01:18:19.261 --> 01:18:21.296
IN THE IN WHEN THE ANCHOR THAT

01:18:21.363 --> 01:18:22.831
FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN COST TO

01:18:22.898 --> 01:18:24.166
PAY FOR HARDENING AND OTHER

01:18:24.232 --> 01:18:25.700
ELEMENTS AND THE VALUE OF THAT

01:18:25.767 --> 01:18:27.202
ALONE IS TWO AND A HALF BILLION

01:18:27.269 --> 01:18:30.172
DOLLARS IN FOR GONE PROFITS.

01:18:30.238 --> 01:18:32.074
WHICH IS A SAVINGS TO REPAIRS

01:18:32.140 --> 01:18:32.374

ELECTRICITY DISTRIBUTION IS

01:21:24.980 --> 01:21:26.047
GOING TO BE SAFER THAN IT IS

WELL.

01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:37.726
WHEN WHEN WE WERE WORKING ON

01:21:37.792 --> 01:21:39.027
LEGISLATION IN THIS AREA OVER

01:21:39.094 --> 01:21:40.195

APPRECIATIVE OF THE VICTIMS THAT

01:21:42.163 --> 01:21:42.964
CAME OUT HERE TODAY AND I THINK

01:21:43.031 --> 01:21:44.532
I DO ACTUALLY THE EVEN THE

01:21:44.599 --> 01:21:45.800
VICTIMS IN OPPOSITION I DO

01:21:45.867 --> 01:21:47.168

01:21:47.235 --> 01:21:48.203
THEY WERE SAYING ABOUT CONCERNED

01:21:48.270 --> 01:21:49.104
ABOUT THE P. YOU SEE.

01:21:49.170 --> 01:21:50.138

PC AND THAT THERE ARE FIRE

01:21:51.806 --> 01:21:53.408
EXPERTS I KNOW ONE OF THE

01:21:53.475 --> 01:21:54.709
OPPOSITION MENTION CAL FIRE AND

01:21:54.776 --> 01:21:56.745
I THINK OUR GOALS WITH THIS BILL

01:21:56.811 --> 01:21:59.214
IS TO MAKE SURE THAT ONE THAT WE

01:21:59.281 --> 01:22:00.815
WERE TIMELY SO THAT WE STARTED.

01:22:00.882 --> 01:22:02.417
TO THIS SORT OF SAFETY

01:22:02.484 --> 01:22:03.485
IMMEDIATELY WHICH IS WHY IT IS

01:22:03.551 --> 01:22:05.053
UNDER THE P. YOU SEE FOR NOW BUT

01:22:05.120 --> 01:22:06.221

THAT WILL BE MOVED OUT BY JULY

01:22:09.457 --> 01:22:10.925
OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO THIS

01:22:10.992 --> 01:22:12.360
WILL NOT MEAN HE'S MAINTAINED

01:22:12.427 --> 01:22:14.029
UNDER THE CPC.

01:22:14.095 --> 01:22:15.530
AND IT WILL BE -- IT WILL BE

01:22:15.597 --> 01:22:17.098
OVERSEEN BY INTERNATIONAL

01:22:17.165 --> 01:22:19.034
EXPERTS ON FIRE SAFETY AND I

01:22:19.100 --> 01:22:20.302
THINK THAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT

01:22:20.368 --> 01:22:21.803
AND IT'S AN IMPORTANT NOTE. FOR

01:22:21.870 --> 01:22:25.373

FROM THE P. UC AND PUT IT INTO A

01:29:10.978 --> 01:29:12.747
STANDALONE OPERATION WHICH

TWENTY THIRTY SIX I JUST WANNA

01:29:27.862 --> 01:29:28.696
MAKE SURE.

01:29:28.763 --> 01:29:30.164
THAT THAT WILL EXPIRE AT THAT

01:29:30.231 --> 01:29:32.867
TIME IN THAT THERE'S NO INTEND

01:29:32.934 --> 01:29:36.838
TO CONTINUE THAT IN ANY FORM.

01:29:36.904 --> 01:29:38.473
SEC COULD YOU JUST SEND I DIDN'T

WILL BE EXTENDED.

01:29:56.124 --> 01:29:57.058
SO THE EXTRA YES THE EXTENSION

01:29:57.125 --> 01:29:58.192
WOULD BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE

01:29:58.259 --> 01:29:59.927

01:31:02.156 --> 01:31:02.857
PURPOSES OF THE FUND

01:31:02.924 --> 01:31:04.525
ADMINISTRATOR IS EXCLUSIVELY FOR

01:31:04.592 --> 01:31:05.626
THE STATE EMPLOYEES.

01:31:05.693 --> 01:31:07.628
IT IS ALL ON RELATED AND DOES

01:31:07.695 --> 01:31:09.063
NOT AFFECT ANYTHING RELATED TO

01:31:09.130 --> 01:31:10.498
THE ISSUANCE OF THE BONDS OR TO

01:31:10.565 --> 01:31:11.732
ANYTHING ELSE THAT WOULD BE BY

01:31:11.799 --> 01:31:12.800
BANKS IT'S JUST.

01:31:12.867 --> 01:31:14.502
THE CURRENT LAW THAT APPLIES TO

01:31:14.569 --> 01:31:16.704
CA JUST BE MAKING IT CLEAR THAT

01:31:16.771 --> 01:31:17.972
PROTECTION FOR STATE EMPLOYEES

01:31:18.039 --> 01:31:20.174
EXTENDS TO THE STATE THE ROLE OF

01:31:20.241 --> 01:31:21.642
STATE EMPLOYEES IN THE CONTEXT

01:31:21.709 --> 01:31:22.710
OF A BEING A MINISTER'S ON THE

FUND WE THANK YOU -- AND THEN.

01:31:25.646 --> 01:31:27.081
THE ONE CHANGE IN THE IN THE

01:31:27.148 --> 01:31:28.916
KIND OF THE LANGUAGE WAS THE THE

01:31:28.983 --> 01:31:32.186
CPUC DEFINING SERIOUS DOUBT AND

01:31:32.253 --> 01:31:33.788
AND I'D MINOR CHANGE THAT'S NOT

01:31:33.855 --> 01:31:35.189
A LEGAL STANDARD.

01:31:35.256 --> 01:31:36.524
AND HOW DOES THAT YOU DO YOU

01:31:36.591 --> 01:31:38.226
HAVE AN TEND OF WHAT IS MEANT BY

01:31:38.292 --> 01:31:39.427
SERIOUS DOUBT AND HOW WOULD THAT

01:31:39.493 --> 01:31:41.362
OF THAT APPLY THE SERIOUS DOUBT

01:31:41.429 --> 01:31:43.264
IS ESSENTIALLY THE THE LANGUAGE

01:31:43.331 --> 01:31:44.432
THAT IS INCLUDING THE FIRST

01:31:44.498 --> 01:31:45.466
DECISIONS AND IN THE FOR A

01:31:45.533 --> 01:31:46.968
STANDARD SO COMES FROM FOR

01:31:47.034 --> 01:31:47.902
DECISIONS.

01:31:47.969 --> 01:31:50.571
APPLYING IT TO STATE LAW IT IS --

01:31:50.638 --> 01:31:52.707
IT IS -- THE LOWER YOU KNOW

01:31:52.773 --> 01:31:54.108
EVIDENTIARY STANDARD THAN SAY

01:31:54.175 --> 01:31:55.810
PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE SO

01:31:55.877 --> 01:31:57.645
IT'S LESS THAN 50% AND IT JUST

01:31:57.712 --> 01:31:59.614
MIRRORS THE FOR A STANDARD TO

01:31:59.680 --> 01:32:00.548
SAY THAT IF THERE IS SERIOUS

01:32:00.615 --> 01:32:01.082
DOUBT.

01:32:01.148 --> 01:32:03.284
THE BURDEN TO PROVE PRUDENT SEE

01:32:03.351 --> 01:32:04.352
WOULD SWITCH BACK TO THE

01:32:04.418 --> 01:32:05.853
UTILITIES OKAY.

01:32:05.920 --> 01:32:07.054
THAT AND THAT'S AS WHAT I WAS

01:32:07.121 --> 01:32:08.589
HOPING IT WOULD BE WHICH I

01:32:08.656 --> 01:32:09.657
DIDN'T KNOW THAT THAT WAS THAT.

01:32:09.724 --> 01:32:16.197
THE DEFINITION AND ANOTHER WOULD

01:32:16.264 --> 01:32:17.231
JUST THE PRUDENT SEE STANDARD.

01:32:17.298 --> 01:32:18.132
IS THAT THE SAME IN THE

01:32:18.199 --> 01:32:19.634
LIQUIDITY FUND -- AS IS IT THE

01:32:19.700 --> 01:32:21.602
SAME STANDARD THROUGH BOTH FUND

01:32:21.669 --> 01:32:23.504
IT IS NOT SO IN THE CONTEXT OF

01:32:23.571 --> 01:32:25.406
THE YOU TO OF THE LIQUIDITY FUND

01:32:25.473 --> 01:32:26.941
IF THE YOUTH IF THE IF.

01:32:27.008 --> 01:32:28.976
THE TWO UTILITIES OPT FOR THE

01:32:29.043 --> 01:32:30.077
LIQUIDITY FUND.

01:32:30.144 --> 01:32:31.779
THE THE THE STANDARD FOR PUTTING

01:32:31.846 --> 01:32:33.047
MANAGER WOULD ACTUALLY RETURNED

01:32:33.114 --> 01:32:35.449
BACK TO THE PRE SB NINE OH ONE

01:32:35.516 --> 01:32:37.451
STANDARD SO IT WOULD BE THE OLD

01:32:37.518 --> 01:32:39.053
STANDARD THAT WAS IN EFFECT WHEN

01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:40.621
THE DENTIST AND DECISION WAS

01:32:40.688 --> 01:32:42.456
ISSUED RELATIVE TO COST RECOVERY.

01:32:42.523 --> 01:32:44.125
THAT'S THE PRETTY SEE STANDARD

01:32:44.191 --> 01:32:44.859
THAT GOES ALONG WITH THE

01:32:44.926 --> 01:32:46.994
LIQUIDITY FUND THE THE STANDARD

01:32:47.061 --> 01:32:48.329
THAT IS BASED ON THE PHONE THE

01:32:48.396 --> 01:32:49.597
FIRST STANDARD BUT INCLUDES

01:32:49.664 --> 01:32:50.831
ADDITIONAL IMPORTANT CONSUMER

01:32:50.898 --> 01:32:52.166
PROTECTION SUCH AS THE ANNUAL

01:32:52.233 --> 01:32:53.434
SAFETY CERTIFICATION.

01:32:53.501 --> 01:32:56.270
THAT IS ONLY AVAILABLE IF WE ARE

01:32:56.337 --> 01:32:57.538
IN THE INSURANCE FUND COSTA

01:32:57.605 --> 01:32:59.340
CONSTRUCT OKAY THAT THAT THAT

01:32:59.407 --> 01:33:01.175
CLARIFIES THAT IDENTIFIED COULD

01:33:01.242 --> 01:33:02.410
MAKE A STATEMENT BECAUSE I IT

01:33:02.476 --> 01:33:03.811
THE END HERE MISTER CHAIR THAT.

01:33:03.878 --> 01:33:05.379
SO I WON'T HAVE TO TAKE MORE

01:33:05.446 --> 01:33:07.214
TIME LATER I YOU KNOW AS I WAS

01:33:07.281 --> 01:33:09.116
LOOKING AT THIS AND AND THE

01:33:09.183 --> 01:33:13.054
ISSUE I THINK ALL OF US FOR THE

01:33:13.120 --> 01:33:13.688
LAST YEAR BEEN TRYING TO COME TO

01:33:13.754 --> 01:33:14.155
SOME.

01:33:14.221 --> 01:33:15.089
IN OUR MIND HOW ARE WE GOING TO

01:33:15.156 --> 01:33:15.756
SOLVE THIS AND WHAT WHAT IS THE

01:33:15.823 --> 01:33:17.158
THE ISSUE THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR

01:33:17.224 --> 01:33:18.726
AND AND ONE IS THE ISSUE OF

01:33:18.793 --> 01:33:19.961
FUTURE LIABILITY.

01:33:20.027 --> 01:33:21.095
WE'RE TEMPTED TO SOLVE THAT

01:33:21.162 --> 01:33:22.296
PROBLEM AND THEN PROBABLY MORE

01:33:22.363 --> 01:33:24.198
IMPORTANTLY TO TO LOOK AT THIS

01:33:24.265 --> 01:33:25.866
THROUGH A REPAIR LANDS TO MAKE

01:33:25.933 --> 01:33:27.702
SURE THAT THE RATE PAYERS ARE

01:33:27.768 --> 01:33:29.870
PROTECTED THROUGHOUT AND THE IN

01:33:29.937 --> 01:33:31.372
THAT'S BEEN TAKEN MY GUIDING

01:33:31.439 --> 01:33:32.907
PHILOSOPHY THROUGHOUT -- HAS

01:33:32.974 --> 01:33:35.176
BEEN YOU KNOW UTILITY MANAGEMENT

01:33:35.242 --> 01:33:36.911
IF THEY MADE POOR DECISIONS ARE

01:33:36.978 --> 01:33:38.312
IF WE SEEN IN THE PAST AND THERE

01:33:38.379 --> 01:33:39.113
INACTION.

01:33:39.180 --> 01:33:40.815
OR THEIR DIVERSION OF OF

01:33:40.881 --> 01:33:42.383
MAINTENANCE OR DIVERSION OF

01:33:42.450 --> 01:33:43.651
FUNDS THAT THEY'VE DONE LED TO A

01:33:43.718 --> 01:33:44.719
FIRE THAN.

01:33:44.785 --> 01:33:46.487
IN THOSE MANAGERS AND

01:33:46.554 --> 01:33:47.221
SHAREHOLDERS I THINK SHOULD BE

01:33:47.288 --> 01:33:49.957
HELD RESPONSIBLE CLEARLY AND

01:33:50.024 --> 01:33:51.058
THEY SHOULD PAY.

01:33:51.125 --> 01:33:51.592
BUT IF THEY DID EVERYTHING

01:33:51.659 --> 01:33:52.493
CORRECTLY THEY DID EVERYTHING

01:33:52.560 --> 01:33:54.295
ACCORDING TO WHATEVER PLAN IS

01:33:54.362 --> 01:33:56.097
DEVELOPED AND MONITORED AND

01:33:56.163 --> 01:33:58.466
AUDITED AND INSPECTED -- AS IT

01:33:58.532 --> 01:34:00.301
GOES FORWARD -- IN THINGS

01:34:00.368 --> 01:34:01.569
HAPPENED.

01:34:01.635 --> 01:34:03.471
THAT CAUSED THAT.

01:34:03.537 --> 01:34:05.773
DESTRUCTION WILD FIRES A DIVING

01:34:05.840 --> 01:34:07.408
BECAUSE WE ALL BENEFIT FROM THE

01:34:07.475 --> 01:34:09.110
UTILITIES BENEFIT FROM THOSE

01:34:09.176 --> 01:34:11.045
WIRES THAT -- THAT ARE TRAVELING

01:34:11.112 --> 01:34:12.947
THROUGH OUR STATE THAN THE THAT

01:34:13.014 --> 01:34:14.982
WE SHOULD COLLECTIVELY SHOULDER

01:34:15.049 --> 01:34:16.751
THOSE COSTS AND AND TO SHARE

01:34:16.817 --> 01:34:18.986
THAT THAT THAT SEEMS FAIR TO ME --

01:34:19.053 --> 01:34:20.321
AND I THINK THIS BILL YOU KNOW

01:34:20.388 --> 01:34:22.056
A. B. TEN OR TEN FIFTY FOUR AND

01:34:22.123 --> 01:34:24.191

AND COMING TOGETHER ON A

01:34:28.062 --> 01:34:29.463
SOLUTION I THINK DOES THAT AND

01:34:29.530 --> 01:34:30.998
IT DOES IT IN A IN A VERY FAIR

01:34:31.065 --> 01:34:34.101
WAY IT -- TO IT BRINGS US TO A

01:34:34.168 --> 01:34:35.636
POINT WHERE THE INSURANCE FUND

01:34:35.703 --> 01:34:37.772
WILL PROTECT THE FUTURES WITH

01:34:37.838 --> 01:34:38.506

RATEPAYERS.

01:34:43.844 --> 01:34:45.146
AND WHEN YOU COMPARE THAT TO THE

01:34:45.212 --> 01:34:47.982
COST TO THE FIFTY FORTY FIFTY

01:34:48.049 --> 01:34:48.549
SIXTY BILLION DOLLARS THAT

01:34:48.616 --> 01:34:49.917

SEVERAL MONTHS.

01:35:46.173 --> 01:35:47.942
I THINK THAT WE CAN ALL COME TO

01:35:48.008 --> 01:35:49.443
TODAY SAYING THAT WE HAD

TO BE TALKING ABOUT THE HEALTH

01:36:16.203 --> 01:36:17.505

FOR FIVE YEARS.

01:36:31.285 --> 01:36:32.253

FROM [inaudible]

01:37:01.015 --> 01:37:02.850
ALL UTILITIES. THIRTY TO FIFTY

01:37:02.917 --> 01:37:05.052
BILLION.

01:37:05.119 --> 01:37:06.387
WITH NO RATE INCREASES THE

01:37:06.453 --> 01:37:08.522
CALIFORNIANS.

01:37:08.589 --> 01:37:10.724
P. GENIES GONNA FORGO ONE POINT

01:37:10.791 --> 01:37:13.160
SIX BILLION IN FIFTY REQUIREMENT

01:37:13.227 --> 01:37:14.461
RATE INCREASES THAT WERE.

01:37:14.528 --> 01:37:16.964
IN THE PIPELINE.

01:37:17.031 --> 01:37:18.666
ON A AND E'S SENATOR HILL JUST

01:37:18.732 --> 01:37:22.002
MENTIONED -- IF THAT INSURANCE

01:37:22.069 --> 01:37:24.538
FUND IS ULTIMATELY UTILIZE.

01:37:24.605 --> 01:37:25.906
SHAREHOLDER FUNDS.

01:37:25.973 --> 01:37:27.841
MUST BE USE FIRST.

01:37:27.908 --> 01:37:30.077
NOT RATE PAYERS.

01:37:30.144 --> 01:37:31.145
AND THAT IS CRITICAL TO THIS

01:37:31.212 --> 01:37:33.147
DEAL.

01:37:33.214 --> 01:37:34.648
THAT SHAREHOLDERS ARE PAYING

01:37:34.715 --> 01:37:36.250
FIRST.

01:37:36.317 --> 01:37:38.252
NOT RATE PAYERS.

01:37:38.319 --> 01:37:40.387
IN THE ONLY WAY THAT A UTILITY

01:37:40.454 --> 01:37:42.256
SUCH AS P. JEANNIE WOULD BE ABLE

01:37:42.323 --> 01:37:43.757
TO ACCESS THE FUNDS WITHIN THE

01:37:43.824 --> 01:37:45.492
INSURANCE FUND.

01:37:45.559 --> 01:37:47.928
IS IF THEY PAY.

01:37:47.995 --> 01:37:50.764
SURVIVORS WHAT THEY'RE DO.

01:37:50.831 --> 01:37:52.132
AND I KNOW THAT THERE MAY BE

01:37:52.199 --> 01:37:55.135
SOME DISAGREEMENT IN THIS ROOM --

01:37:55.202 --> 01:37:56.737
AT THE SAME TIME THOUGH.

01:37:56.804 --> 01:37:57.972
THERE IS BEEN.

01:37:58.038 --> 01:37:59.306
KNOW WHETHER DEAL IN FRONT OF

01:37:59.373 --> 01:38:01.075
THIS LEGISLATURE.

01:38:01.141 --> 01:38:02.810
I WOULD ENSURE FIRE SURVIVORS

01:38:02.876 --> 01:38:05.045
WOULD BE PAID OUT.

01:38:05.112 --> 01:38:07.214
PRIOR TO UTILITY ACCESSING

01:38:07.281 --> 01:38:10.117
ADDITIONAL FUNDS.

01:38:10.184 --> 01:38:11.185
I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THE ISSUE

01:38:11.252 --> 01:38:13.354
OF TRUST.

01:38:13.420 --> 01:38:15.556
AND JUST BEING HONEST ABOUT IT

01:38:15.623 --> 01:38:16.890
THERE IS AN ISSUE OF TRUST WITH

01:38:16.957 --> 01:38:17.858
P. JEANNIE AND ALL TO SPEAK FOR

01:38:17.925 --> 01:38:19.493
MYSELF.

01:38:19.560 --> 01:38:22.429
AND THAT IS WHY -- I APPRECIATE

01:38:22.496 --> 01:38:26.400
THE FOCUS ON EXECUTIVE PAY.

01:38:26.467 --> 01:38:28.202
THIS BILL WHILE IT IS NOT

01:38:28.269 --> 01:38:30.170
PERFECT MAKES SIGNIFICANT

01:38:30.237 --> 01:38:32.473
STRIDES TO HOLD.

01:38:32.539 --> 01:38:33.874
P. JEANNIE TILLY'S ACCOUNTABLE

01:38:33.941 --> 01:38:35.876
AND I TO GO THROUGH THREE POINTS

01:38:35.943 --> 01:38:36.977
NUMBER.

01:38:37.044 --> 01:38:39.013
ONE IN INEXTRICABLE STRICT

01:38:39.079 --> 01:38:40.681
LIMITS ON CASH COMPENSATION.

01:38:40.748 --> 01:38:42.182
WITH PAY LINKED TO PERFORMANCE

01:38:42.249 --> 01:38:45.719
METRICS AND NO GUARANTEE THOSE.

01:38:45.786 --> 01:38:48.055
IT WAS A GREGIS.

01:38:48.122 --> 01:38:49.590
THAT PEOPLE JUST LOST THEIR

01:38:49.657 --> 01:38:51.358
HOMES IN EXECUTIVES.

01:38:51.425 --> 01:38:53.460
THOUSANDS OF EXECUTIVES WERE.

01:38:53.527 --> 01:38:56.163
ABOUT TO SEE THEIR PAY GO UP.

01:38:56.230 --> 01:38:56.764
THIS BILL WILL PUT A LIMIT ON

01:38:56.830 --> 01:39:00.834
THAT. TO A SIGNIFICANT PORTION

01:39:00.901 --> 01:39:02.569
OF COMPENSATION AND BE TIED TO

01:39:02.636 --> 01:39:05.539
LONG TERM PERFORMANCE AND VALUE.

01:39:05.606 --> 01:39:07.374
THREE THERE'D BE INCENTIVES TIED

01:39:07.441 --> 01:39:08.709
TO COMPENSATION TO SAFETY.

01:39:08.776 --> 01:39:10.611
INCLUDING TIME 1100% OF

01:39:10.678 --> 01:39:12.212
INCENTIVE COMPENSATION TO SAFETY

01:39:12.279 --> 01:39:13.981
PERFORMANCE AND DENYING ALL

01:39:14.048 --> 01:39:15.849
INCENTIVE COMPENSATION IF

01:39:15.916 --> 01:39:17.451
UTILITY CAUSES A CATASTROPHIC

01:39:17.518 --> 01:39:18.452
WHILE FIRE.

01:39:18.519 --> 01:39:20.421
WHICH RESULT IN ONE OR MORE

01:39:20.487 --> 01:39:21.522
FATALITIES.

01:39:21.588 --> 01:39:22.790
THE OTHER CHANGE THIS BILL IS

01:39:22.856 --> 01:39:25.359
SEEN OVER THE PAST. TEN DAYS IS

01:39:25.426 --> 01:39:25.926
THE BURDEN OF PROOF STANDARD

01:39:25.993 --> 01:39:27.761
IT'S FLIPPED.

01:39:27.828 --> 01:39:28.996
THE BURDEN OF PROOF STANDARD HAS

01:39:29.063 --> 01:39:30.664
BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY AMENDED FROM

01:39:30.731 --> 01:39:32.733
WHAT WAS FIRST INCLUDED WITHIN

01:39:32.800 --> 01:39:34.468
IT AB.

01:39:34.535 --> 01:39:35.102
TEN FIFTY FOUR IT ENSURES

01:39:35.169 --> 01:39:36.403
UTILITIES HAVE THE ULTIMATE

01:39:36.470 --> 01:39:38.972
BURDEN TO SHOW THAT THEY WERE

01:39:39.039 --> 01:39:40.240
PRUDENT IF.

01:39:40.307 --> 01:39:41.208
JUST OUT TO RAISE ABOUT THEIR

01:39:41.275 --> 01:39:43.677
CONTACT SO WHAT THAT MEANS IS

01:39:43.744 --> 01:39:44.878
THAT.

01:39:44.945 --> 01:39:47.348
IF AN INDIVIDUAL OR ADVOCACY

01:39:47.414 --> 01:39:50.384
GROUPS GO IN FRONT OF THE PC.

01:39:50.451 --> 01:39:51.952
BOTTOM LINE IN THIS AND THEY ARE

01:39:52.019 --> 01:39:53.387
ABLE.

01:39:53.454 --> 01:39:55.422
TO SHOW THE P. YOU SEE.

01:39:55.489 --> 01:39:56.824
THAT THERE IS PROOF THAT THE

01:39:56.890 --> 01:39:59.827
UTILITY COSTS A WILDFIRE OR

01:39:59.893 --> 01:40:01.595
ADVANCE SERIES DOUBTS THREE

01:40:01.662 --> 01:40:03.597
MEMBERS OF THE PC SIDES WITH

01:40:03.664 --> 01:40:04.998
THOSE RATE PAYERS ADVOCATES.

01:40:05.065 --> 01:40:06.300
AND THAT.

01:40:06.367 --> 01:40:07.601
MEANS THAT THERE.

01:40:07.668 --> 01:40:09.670
WOULD BE ENHANCE INVESTIGATION

01:40:09.737 --> 01:40:10.637
AND THAT.

01:40:10.704 --> 01:40:12.373
I UTILITIES WOULD BE HOLD

01:40:12.439 --> 01:40:13.507
ACCOUNTABLE.

01:40:13.574 --> 01:40:14.208
BACK TO TALK ABOUT SAFETY

01:40:14.274 --> 01:40:16.610
CERTIFICATION.

01:40:16.677 --> 01:40:17.544
THE REASON WHY I THINK THE

01:40:17.611 --> 01:40:19.012
STANDALONE DEPARTMENT.

01:40:19.079 --> 01:40:21.882
IS IMPORTANT IS BECAUSE WE NEED

01:40:21.949 --> 01:40:22.616
A DEPARTMENT IT IS SOLELY

01:40:22.683 --> 01:40:25.519
FOCUSED ON THE SAFETY OF OUR

01:40:25.586 --> 01:40:26.954
ELECTRICITY INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:40:27.020 --> 01:40:29.089
THE GENTLEMAN TO MY LEFT SENATOR

01:40:29.156 --> 01:40:31.091
HILL HAS DONE YEOMAN'S WORK ON

01:40:31.158 --> 01:40:33.761
ALL ISSUES ON THE GAS SIDE I

01:40:33.827 --> 01:40:34.628
THINK THIS IS.

01:40:34.695 --> 01:40:37.231
ALSO CRITICAL TO PROTECT

01:40:37.297 --> 01:40:39.533
CALIFORNIANS IN TWO IMPORTANT

01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:39.733
WAYS.

01:40:39.800 --> 01:40:42.136
NUMBER.

01:40:42.202 --> 01:40:42.736
ONE IT'S GOING TO PROVIDE BOTH

01:40:42.803 --> 01:40:45.205
OVERSIGHT. FOR INVESTOR OWNED

01:40:45.272 --> 01:40:47.241
AND PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITIES AND

01:40:47.307 --> 01:40:48.275
IT'S ACTUALLY CAN HAVE A CLEAR

01:40:48.342 --> 01:40:50.377
MISSION A CLEAR MISSION TO FOCUS

01:40:50.444 --> 01:40:51.845
ON SAFETY STANDARDS WHEN IT

01:40:51.912 --> 01:40:53.147
COMES TO LINES.

01:40:53.213 --> 01:40:54.948
THROUGHOUT THE STATE IT WILL

01:40:55.015 --> 01:40:56.717
ALSO BE MORE NIMBLE IN THE

01:40:56.784 --> 01:40:58.352
PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION TO

01:40:58.419 --> 01:41:00.954
BE ABLE TO RESPOND. TO NEW

01:41:01.021 --> 01:41:02.723
CHALLENGES THAT UTILITIES MAY

01:41:02.790 --> 01:41:04.558
FACE WHEN IT COMES TO CUSTOMER

01:41:04.625 --> 01:41:06.293
SAFETY.

01:41:06.360 --> 01:41:08.462
FINALLY MISTER CHAIR ALL ENDED

01:41:08.529 --> 01:41:09.096
HERE AND I COULD TALK ABOUT THE

01:41:09.163 --> 01:41:11.165
FUTURE.

01:41:11.231 --> 01:41:12.232
THERE ARE SOME ISSUES THAT WE'RE

01:41:12.299 --> 01:41:13.467
NOT TALKING ABOUT TODAY THAT

01:41:13.534 --> 01:41:14.334
NEED TO BE DISCUSSED IN THIS

01:41:14.401 --> 01:41:16.537
LEGISLATIVE SESSION.

01:41:16.603 --> 01:41:17.404
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF

01:41:17.471 --> 01:41:18.806
CALIFORNIANS HAVE SENIOR

01:41:18.872 --> 01:41:21.809
INSURANCE NON RENEWED -- IN

01:41:21.875 --> 01:41:24.144
THOUSANDS THOUSANDS THIS OCTOBER

01:41:24.211 --> 01:41:26.313
WILL SEE THEIR RENTAL ASSISTANCE

01:41:26.380 --> 01:41:26.613
[inaudible]

01:41:26.680 --> 01:41:28.982
PRIOR.

01:41:29.049 --> 01:41:30.717
IN THIS LEGISLATURE NEEDS A COME

01:41:30.784 --> 01:41:32.186
BACK TOGETHER WITH AN AGREEMENT.

01:41:32.252 --> 01:41:34.087
WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO FOCUS

01:41:34.154 --> 01:41:35.889
ON THE ISSUE OF INSURANCE AND

01:41:35.956 --> 01:41:36.857
LIKE.

01:41:36.924 --> 01:41:38.525
TO ASK MISS MONSANTO OUT WHAT

01:41:38.592 --> 01:41:39.960
HER THOUGHTS ARE ON THAT IN

01:41:40.027 --> 01:41:40.894
ADDITION.

01:41:40.961 --> 01:41:42.763
I THINK THAT WE ALSO NEED TO

01:41:42.830 --> 01:41:45.299
HAVE A FOCUS ON A INVESTMENTS IN

01:41:45.365 --> 01:41:46.733
COMMUNITIES FOR HOME HARDENING.

01:41:46.800 --> 01:41:49.002
UP FOR GREAT HARDENING IN FIRE

01:41:49.069 --> 01:41:50.137
RESILIENCE AND THAT'S SOMETHING

01:41:50.204 --> 01:41:51.305
THAT SENATOR STERN HAS BEEN.

01:41:51.371 --> 01:41:53.006
VERY FOCUSED ON SENATOR WIENER

01:41:53.073 --> 01:41:55.409
AS WELL -- AND I THINK THAT'S

01:41:55.476 --> 01:41:57.311
GOING TO BE CRITICAL AS WE COME

01:41:57.377 --> 01:42:00.214
BACK AND I HAVE ONE LAST ITEM

01:42:00.280 --> 01:42:01.081

ON ISSUES OF RESILIENCE

01:42:06.854 --> 01:42:08.856
HARDENING IN INSURANCE.

01:42:08.922 --> 01:42:10.224
THOSE CENTER -- YOU WE SEE THIS

01:42:10.290 --> 01:42:12.526
AS PART OF A PACKAGE OF BILLS ON

01:42:12.593 --> 01:42:13.961
IMPORTANT INVESTMENTS INCLUDING

01:42:14.027 --> 01:42:15.362
THE BUDGET IN THE AREA OF

01:42:15.429 --> 01:42:18.232
LITIGATION -- IN THE AREA OF

01:42:18.298 --> 01:42:19.633
ADDRESSING AND REDUCING THE

01:42:19.700 --> 01:42:21.702
FREQUENCY AND THE INTENSITY OF

01:42:21.768 --> 01:42:23.170
WILDFIRES.

01:42:23.237 --> 01:42:26.406
THE ISSUE OF INSURANCE WAS --

01:42:26.473 --> 01:42:28.108
DEFINITELY FOCUS OF THE BOTH THE

STRIKEFORCE REPORT AS WELL AS A

01:42:29.543 --> 01:42:31.512
NINE A ONE REPORT AND WE SEE

01:42:31.578 --> 01:42:33.080
THAT AS AN AREA THERE ARE MANY

01:42:33.146 --> 01:42:34.348
MANY ARE.

01:42:34.414 --> 01:42:35.649
GOOD -- MEASURES WORKING THROUGH

INSURANCE COMMISSIONER AND THE

01:42:40.587 --> 01:42:41.989
BALANCE OF THE SESSION --

01:42:42.055 --> 01:42:43.357
SIMILARLY WE SEE LOTS OF

01:42:43.423 --> 01:42:44.725
OPPORTUNITIES IN THE AREA

01:42:44.791 --> 01:42:46.627
SUPPORTING COMMUNITY RESILIENCY --

01:42:46.693 --> 01:42:48.028
WE SEE OPPORTUNITIES BOTH AS

01:42:48.095 --> 01:42:50.430
PART OF THIS MEASURE AND HOW THE

01:42:50.497 --> 01:42:51.565
FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN THE WALL

01:42:51.632 --> 01:42:53.934
FOR MITIGATION PLAN -- GETS USED

01:42:54.001 --> 01:42:55.636
TO ENSURE THAT THE RESILIENCY

01:42:55.702 --> 01:42:57.304
EFFORT FROM THE UTILITY SIDE OF

THE EQUATION IS FOCUSED ON OUR

01:42:59.306 --> 01:43:00.541
ALMOST WILL DOUBLE COMMUNITIES

01:43:06.813 --> 01:43:07.981
THAT ADDRESS -- THAT DID THE

01:43:08.048 --> 01:43:09.383

READY TO REDUCE THE RISK AND

01:43:14.955 --> 01:43:16.290
FREQUENCY OF WILDFIRES.

01:43:16.356 --> 01:43:18.058
I APPRECIATE IT UNDER WINNER

01:43:18.125 --> 01:43:18.692
WE'RE GONNA GO TO CENTER WINNER

INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES IS

01:46:34.688 --> 01:46:35.789
BROKEN.

01:46:35.856 --> 01:46:38.024
IT IS A BROKEN MODEL THAT IS NOT

01:46:38.091 --> 01:46:39.593

DRAMATIC -- MANIFESTATION OF

01:46:48.502 --> 01:46:50.270
THAT FILURE WE'VE SEEN THE

01:46:50.337 --> 01:46:51.505
FAILURE AND OTHER RISK.

01:46:51.571 --> 01:46:52.806
RESPECTS AS WELL IT'S NOT

01:46:52.873 --> 01:46:55.008

01:46:55.075 --> 01:46:56.610
TOWARDS THE FUTURE AND WHAT THAT

01:46:56.676 --> 01:46:59.646
MEANS FOR OUR POWER SYSTEM.

01:46:59.713 --> 01:47:01.515
AND I THINK IN TERMS OF THE

01:47:01.581 --> 01:47:02.983
MISSED OPPORTUNITY THERE WERE I

01:47:03.049 --> 01:47:04.885

SENATE WHO HAD ASKED -- THAT

01:47:06.987 --> 01:47:08.955
THERE BE -- SOME PROVISIONS IN

01:47:09.022 --> 01:47:10.791
THIS BILL TO SAY WE'RE NOT JUST

01:47:10.857 --> 01:47:13.794
GOING TO TRY -- TO FREEZE A

01:47:13.860 --> 01:47:15.695
BROKEN SYSTEM IN AMBER. TO PATCH

01:47:15.762 --> 01:47:17.497
IT UP WITH TRIAGE OF COURSE WE

01:47:17.564 --> 01:47:19.399
HAVE TO DO TRIAGE -- BUT TO SAY

01:47:19.466 --> 01:47:21.268
WE'RE NOT ONLY GOING TO DO

01:47:21.334 --> 01:47:22.936
TRIAGE FOR BROKEN SYSTEM WE'RE

01:47:23.003 --> 01:47:24.504
ALSO GOING TO PLANT SEEDS FOR

01:47:24.571 --> 01:47:25.472
THE FUTURE.

01:47:25.539 --> 01:47:27.641
OF BURKE FUTURE OF A MORE

01:47:27.707 --> 01:47:29.876
DECENTRALIZED -- OR DISTRIBUTED

01:47:29.943 --> 01:47:32.646
APPROACH TO ENERGY AND SO WE ACT

01:47:32.712 --> 01:47:34.714
GAVE SOME IDEAS ABOUT --

01:47:34.781 --> 01:47:36.750
DIFFERENT DVR DISTRIBUTED ENERGY

01:47:36.817 --> 01:47:38.785
RESOURCE COMPONENTS THAT GO INTO

PLANTING THOSE SEEDS IN SENDING

01:47:43.490 --> 01:47:44.257

01:47:56.736 --> 01:47:58.371
THE BILL -- FROM MY PERSPECTIVE

01:47:58.438 --> 01:48:00.040
IT'S A MISSED OPPORTUNITY NOT TO

01:48:00.106 --> 01:48:02.108

FRANKLY TACKLING. ONE OF THE

01:50:28.888 --> 01:50:31.191
BETTER THE BIGGEST -- ISSUES

01:50:31.257 --> 01:50:32.625
THAT WE HAVE BEFORE US.

01:50:32.692 --> 01:50:34.461
I IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

01:50:34.527 --> 01:50:35.562
TODAY.

01:50:35.628 --> 01:50:37.297
I KNOW PLAN IS PERFECT BUT

01:50:37.364 --> 01:50:38.565
NEITHER IS THE WILDFIRE

01:50:38.631 --> 01:50:39.766
SITUATION WE FACE IS

01:50:39.833 --> 01:50:41.901
CALIFORNIANS.

01:50:41.968 --> 01:50:42.936
CLIMATE CHANGE IS DRIVING MORE

01:50:43.003 --> 01:50:44.504
DESTRUCTIVE FIRES AT EVER AT A

01:50:44.571 --> 01:50:46.373
TIME WITH THE STATE'S LARGEST

01:50:46.439 --> 01:50:49.142
UTILITY PGD HAS SADLY DUCT ITS

01:50:49.209 --> 01:50:52.846
RESPONSIBILITIES UNDER STATE LAW.

01:50:52.912 --> 01:50:53.680
THIS BILL REPRESENTS A

01:50:53.747 --> 01:50:54.581
SIGNIFICANT PART OF THAT

01:50:54.647 --> 01:50:56.416
SOLUTION.

01:50:56.483 --> 01:50:58.218
IT WOULD HELP COMPENSATE PAST

01:50:58.284 --> 01:51:00.720
AND PRESENT VICTIMS.

01:51:00.787 --> 01:51:02.422
I PREVENT FUTURE DISASTERS AND

01:51:02.489 --> 01:51:04.290
PROTECT UTILITY RATE PAYERS FROM

01:51:04.357 --> 01:51:05.959
SUBSTANTIAL AN UNFAIR RATE

01:51:06.026 --> 01:51:08.028
INCREASES.

01:51:08.094 --> 01:51:09.896
CLEARLY IT'S A LIFELINE. FOR

01:51:09.963 --> 01:51:11.831
UTILITY CUSTOMERS MAKE NO

01:51:11.898 --> 01:51:15.035
MISTAKE THIS IS NOT A UTILITY

01:51:15.101 --> 01:51:16.202
BAIL OUT.

01:51:16.269 --> 01:51:20.407
IT'S A RATE PAYER BAILOUT.

01:51:20.473 --> 01:51:21.708
IT REQUIRES P. GENIE IN THE

01:51:21.775 --> 01:51:22.909
STATE'S OTHER TO BE YOU

01:51:22.976 --> 01:51:28.148
UTILITIES TO PONY UP FIVE NEEDED

01:51:28.214 --> 01:51:30.283
SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS.

01:51:30.350 --> 01:51:31.251
UTILITIES WILL BE ALLOWED TO

01:51:31.317 --> 01:51:33.019
MAKE A SET OF PROFIT FROM THESE

01:51:33.086 --> 01:51:34.788
EXPENSES.

01:51:34.854 --> 01:51:36.823
THE PLAN ALSO CREATES A FUND TO

01:51:36.890 --> 01:51:38.858
HELP SHIELD CUSTOMERS FROM COSTS

01:51:38.925 --> 01:51:41.127
OF ANY FUTURE WILD FIRES.

01:51:41.194 --> 01:51:43.496
IN THE THE COST OF CAPITAL THAT

01:51:43.563 --> 01:51:45.432
COME WITH THOSE RISKS.

01:51:45.498 --> 01:51:47.767
IT ALSO MANDATES A STRICT WHEN

01:51:47.834 --> 01:51:49.836
YOUR TIME LIFE FOR P. JEANNIE TO

01:51:49.903 --> 01:51:51.304
EMERGE FROM CHAPTER.

01:51:51.371 --> 01:51:52.705
ELEVEN INSURING THAT SETTLEMENTS

01:51:52.772 --> 01:51:55.675
ARE REACH WITH ALL TWO THOUSAND

01:51:55.742 --> 01:51:56.242
SEVENTEEN AND EIGHTEEN FIRE

01:51:56.309 --> 01:51:57.010
VICTIMS.

01:51:57.077 --> 01:52:00.213
WE MUST HOLD -- THESE COMPANIES --

01:52:00.280 --> 01:52:01.815
THE COMPANY -- ACCOUNTABLE TO

01:52:01.881 --> 01:52:03.116
THAT END THE BILL REQUIRES STATE

01:52:03.183 --> 01:52:06.586
REGULATORS TO STEP UP OVERSIGHT.

01:52:06.653 --> 01:52:07.821
AND ENFORCEMENT OF YOU TO

01:52:07.887 --> 01:52:08.855
COMPANIES LIKE P. JEANNIE

01:52:08.922 --> 01:52:11.558
INCLUDING DOING PHYSICAL AUDIT I

01:52:11.624 --> 01:52:13.626
THINK THAT'S A VERY BIG

01:52:13.693 --> 01:52:14.961
IMPORTANT PART OF THIS.

01:52:15.028 --> 01:52:17.230
DOING NOTHING IS NOT AN OPTION

01:52:17.297 --> 01:52:19.599
IF WE SIT BY UTILITY RATE IDLY

01:52:19.666 --> 01:52:22.302
BY UTILITY RATES WOULD DOUBLE

01:52:22.368 --> 01:52:23.603
UNDER THE STATUS QUO.

01:52:23.670 --> 01:52:25.071
WE TOOK IMPORTANT STEPS LAST

01:52:25.138 --> 01:52:26.406
YEAR INCLUDING STRENGTHENING OUR

01:52:26.473 --> 01:52:28.174
FIRE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE

01:52:28.241 --> 01:52:30.143
CAPABILITIES AND WE BUILT ON

01:52:30.210 --> 01:52:31.511
THAT FOUNDATION IN THIS YEAR'S

01:52:31.578 --> 01:52:33.446
BUDGET WITH SIGNIFICANT NEW

01:52:33.513 --> 01:52:34.914
INVESTMENTS.

01:52:34.981 --> 01:52:35.748
BUT THERE'S STILL MUCH MORE TO

01:52:35.815 --> 01:52:37.650
DO AS PART OF THE SOLUTION I

01:52:37.717 --> 01:52:39.986
HAVE -- INTRODUCED A HALF DOZEN

01:52:40.053 --> 01:52:42.055
WILDFIRES SAFETY BILLS -- THIS

01:52:42.122 --> 01:52:43.623
YEAR IN A NUMBER OF MY

01:52:43.690 --> 01:52:45.525
COLLEAGUES IN BOTH THE SENATE IN

01:52:45.592 --> 01:52:47.360
THE ASSEMBLY HAVE INTRODUCED A

01:52:47.427 --> 01:52:49.295
NUMBER OF BILLS THAT WILL HELP

01:52:49.362 --> 01:52:50.663
IN THIS REGARD.

01:52:50.730 --> 01:52:52.132
AS WE HELP ROUND OUT THE

01:52:52.198 --> 01:52:53.333
SOLUTION FOR THIS YEAR.

01:52:53.399 --> 01:52:55.468
BUT OUR FOCUS MUST REMAIN ON

01:52:55.535 --> 01:52:57.504
COMPENSATING VICTIMS STOPPING

01:52:57.570 --> 01:52:59.439
NEW WILDFIRES IN PREVENTING

01:52:59.506 --> 01:53:03.877
OUTRAGEOUS COST ON REPAIRS.

01:53:03.943 --> 01:53:04.777
THERE'S NO SILVER BULLET FOR

01:53:04.844 --> 01:53:05.845
THIS PROBLEM BUT THE LEGISLATURE

01:53:05.912 --> 01:53:06.212
HAS A CHANCE.

01:53:06.279 --> 01:53:08.214
AT TO MAKE MAJOR STRIDES NOW

01:53:08.281 --> 01:53:09.816
TOWARDS THOSE AIMS.

01:53:09.883 --> 01:53:10.884
IT CAN'T COME SOON ENOUGH AND

01:53:10.950 --> 01:53:13.520
I'D JUST WILL YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY --

01:53:13.586 --> 01:53:15.722
WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS AND

01:53:15.788 --> 01:53:16.956
THINK THAT THIS IS YOU KNOW

01:53:17.023 --> 01:53:18.124
SOMETHING THAT IS JUST SO

01:53:18.191 --> 01:53:20.760
IMPORTANT PARTICULARLY RIGHT NOW.

01:53:20.827 --> 01:53:24.797
OF FOR THOSE MEMBERS THAT HAVE --

01:53:24.864 --> 01:53:27.634
YOU KNOW -- CONSTITUENTS IN THE

01:53:27.700 --> 01:53:29.035
SERVICE TERRITORIES -- SOUTHERN

01:53:29.102 --> 01:53:30.970
CALIFORNIA EDISON SAN DIEGO GAS

01:53:31.037 --> 01:53:33.039
ELECTRIC -- I THINK IT'S VERY

01:53:33.106 --> 01:53:35.308
VERY IMPORTANT -- IN THOSE AREAS

01:53:35.375 --> 01:53:38.244
THAT -- FOR PROTECTION OF YOUR

01:53:38.311 --> 01:53:40.213
CONSTITUENTS THAT THAT WE GET A

01:53:40.280 --> 01:53:43.149
YES VOTE ON THIS AS WELL THANK

01:53:43.216 --> 01:53:46.452
YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN [inaudible]

01:53:46.519 --> 01:53:50.890
MISTER CHAIR -- MY COLLEAGUES

01:53:50.957 --> 01:53:52.058
HAVE EXPRESSED THIS BUT I THINK

01:53:52.125 --> 01:53:53.493
IT'S BEARS REPEATING THAT WE

01:53:53.560 --> 01:53:56.763
HAVE A UTILITY THAT IS FAILED TO

01:53:56.829 --> 01:53:58.431
EMBRACE SAFETY CULTURE.

01:53:58.498 --> 01:54:01.534
AND SEVERELY WE SAW WITH THE SAN

01:54:01.601 --> 01:54:03.036
BRUNO INCIDENT WE SO AND WE FIND

01:54:03.102 --> 01:54:04.571
IT WITH FIRES.

01:54:04.637 --> 01:54:08.541
AND IT IS SOMETHING THAT.

01:54:08.608 --> 01:54:10.710
BY TH WHILE I THINK THIS BILL

01:54:10.777 --> 01:54:13.513
MAKES A SOME VERY IMPORTANT

01:54:13.580 --> 01:54:15.782
STEPS TOWARDS ENSURING THAT WE

01:54:15.848 --> 01:54:17.717
HOLD OUR ARE USED TO THE HIGHEST

01:54:17.784 --> 01:54:19.552
SAFETY STANDARDS.

01:54:19.619 --> 01:54:21.554
IT'S NOT ENOUGH YET I DON'T MEAN

01:54:21.621 --> 01:54:23.456
THAT THAT'S NOT IN OPPOSITION TO

01:54:23.523 --> 01:54:25.158
THE BILL IT'S JUST THAT. TO

01:54:25.225 --> 01:54:26.993
ACHIEVE THE TYPE OF SAFETY THAT

01:54:27.060 --> 01:54:29.829
WE EXPECT IN EVERY CALIFORNIAN

01:54:29.896 --> 01:54:31.831
EXPECTS [inaudible]

01:54:31.898 --> 01:54:34.200
B. -- THIS NEXT BILL THAT NOT

01:54:34.267 --> 01:54:34.801
TODAY THAT WILL BE CONSIDERING

01:54:34.867 --> 01:54:37.003
THAT ESTABLISHES THE SEPARATE

01:54:37.070 --> 01:54:38.371
COMPLETELY SEPARATE DIVISION

01:54:38.438 --> 01:54:39.839
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE SURE

01:54:39.906 --> 01:54:42.075
THAT IT HAS THE EXPERTISE IN THE

01:54:42.141 --> 01:54:43.576
AUTHORITY THAT WILL BE NEEDED.

01:54:43.643 --> 01:54:45.044
TO REALLY ACHIEVE.

01:54:45.111 --> 01:54:49.015
THAT SAFETY CULTURE WHICH WE CAN

01:54:49.082 --> 01:54:49.882
POINT A FINGER.

01:54:49.949 --> 01:54:50.984
AT THE I. R. USE BUT WE NEED TO

01:54:51.050 --> 01:54:52.318
ALSO POINT OUR FINGERS AT

01:54:52.385 --> 01:54:54.887
OURSELVES AND OUR REGULATORY

01:54:54.954 --> 01:54:55.388
COMMISSION.

01:54:55.455 --> 01:54:57.257
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE SEE

01:54:57.323 --> 01:54:59.359
JUST POINT FINGERS IT MEANS THAT

01:54:59.425 --> 01:55:01.894
WE HAVE -- TO IN.

01:55:01.961 --> 01:55:03.062
WE HAVE TO TAKE IT SERIOUSLY

01:55:03.129 --> 01:55:04.897
IMPROVE AND I LOOK FORWARD TO

01:55:04.964 --> 01:55:07.200
THE DISCUSSION ON THAT NEXT ONE

01:55:07.267 --> 01:55:08.501
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO THAT AND

01:55:08.568 --> 01:55:10.169
THERE'S MUCH IN HERE.

01:55:10.236 --> 01:55:12.238
THAT HELPS AND BUT THE THING

01:55:12.305 --> 01:55:14.540
SEEN HERE THAT HELP OUR MORE THE

01:55:14.607 --> 01:55:17.310
ISSUES OF AN IMPROVED SAFETY

01:55:17.377 --> 01:55:18.911
CERTIFICATION.

01:55:18.978 --> 01:55:26.586
AND THE ISSUES AROUND -- PUTTING

01:55:26.653 --> 01:55:27.920
THE BURDEN.

01:55:27.987 --> 01:55:30.923
ON THE SHAREHOLDERS IF THAT

01:55:30.990 --> 01:55:35.028
UTILITY IS NOT BEEN SHOWN.

01:55:35.094 --> 01:55:36.529
TO HAVE YOU IF IT WAS SHOWN TO

01:55:36.596 --> 01:55:39.832
BE NEGLIGIBLE AND ALSO AS OTHER

01:55:39.899 --> 01:55:41.668
COLLEAGUES HAVE POINTED OUT.

01:55:41.734 --> 01:55:44.370
THE PARTS ABOUT THAT CORRECTLY

01:55:44.437 --> 01:55:46.973
LIMIT THE ABILITY BY -- USED TO

01:55:47.040 --> 01:55:49.242
REWARD EXACTS OR TO REWARD THEIR

01:55:49.309 --> 01:55:50.810
SHAREHOLDERS WHEN THEY ARE NICK

01:55:50.877 --> 01:55:53.212
NEGLIGENT SO THOSE THINGS.

01:55:53.279 --> 01:55:55.181
ARE VERY IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF

01:55:55.248 --> 01:55:57.350
THIS BILL AND AMENDMENTS THAT

01:55:57.417 --> 01:55:58.751
WERE TAKEN FROM WHEN WE SAW IT A

01:55:58.818 --> 01:56:00.753
WEEK AGO OUR GREAT IMPROVEMENTS

01:56:00.820 --> 01:56:04.257
IN THAT AREA SO I WANT TO BE

01:56:04.324 --> 01:56:05.925
VERY CLEAR ABOUT THAT -- I THINK

01:56:05.992 --> 01:56:06.759
THAT.

01:56:06.826 --> 01:56:09.362
IN OUR QUEST TO REALLY IMPROVE

01:56:09.429 --> 01:56:10.463
THE SAFETY.

01:56:10.530 --> 01:56:13.166
AND AGAIN THAT WILL -- THERE'S

01:56:13.232 --> 01:56:14.834
NOT A LOT OF DETAIL IN HERE.

01:56:14.901 --> 01:56:16.336
BUT WE NEED TO ALSO LOOK AT

01:56:16.402 --> 01:56:21.474
TECHNOLOGY BECAUSE THE WITH THIS

01:56:21.541 --> 01:56:23.476
WITH THE FACT THAT WE ARE IN A

01:56:23.543 --> 01:56:24.644
CLIMATE.

01:56:24.711 --> 01:56:26.779
CHAOS WORLD NOW THERE'S NO

01:56:26.846 --> 01:56:28.848
BACKING AWAY FROM THAT WE MAY

01:56:28.915 --> 01:56:31.984
AVOID FARD MUCH FURTHER WORST

01:56:32.051 --> 01:56:33.886
CATASTROPHIC CLIMATE CHANGE BUT

01:56:33.953 --> 01:56:36.823
WE ARE IN A CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE.

01:56:36.889 --> 01:56:39.892
AS WE KNOW ALREADY FROM THE DATA

01:56:39.959 --> 01:56:41.494
WHERE WE ARE GOING TO BE HOTTER.

01:56:41.561 --> 01:56:42.929
AND WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE THE

01:56:42.995 --> 01:56:43.930
NIGHT TIME COOLING.

01:56:43.996 --> 01:56:46.065
WE ARE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE

01:56:46.132 --> 01:56:48.701
PATTERNS THAT CREATE WILDFIRES

01:56:48.768 --> 01:56:50.636
IN THERE'S NO WAY WE CAN REMOVE

01:56:50.703 --> 01:56:52.905
THE VEGETATION OR COMPLETELY

01:56:52.972 --> 01:56:56.676
ELIMINATE THE DEVELOPMENT THAT

01:56:56.743 --> 01:56:59.011
IS OCCURRED IN OUR URBAN

01:56:59.078 --> 01:57:00.513
WILDLAND INTERFACE SO WE'RE

01:57:00.580 --> 01:57:01.047
GONNA HAVE FIRES.

01:57:01.114 --> 01:57:02.482
AND MANY OF THEM WILL BE.

01:57:02.548 --> 01:57:04.684
BECAUSE OF SPARKS FROM THIS

01:57:04.751 --> 01:57:06.386
UTILITY EQUIPMENT THE TWO HUGE

01:57:06.452 --> 01:57:07.954
STATE.

01:57:08.020 --> 01:57:10.056
SOME TECHNOLOGIES ARE AVAILABLE

01:57:10.123 --> 01:57:12.525
TO US TO GIVE US THE REAL TIME

01:57:12.592 --> 01:57:14.193
INFORMATION WHEN THOSE SPARKS

01:57:14.260 --> 01:57:16.529
OCCUR AND WE NEED TO USE MORE TO

01:57:16.596 --> 01:57:18.498
THAT BECAUSE WE DO NOT THE STATE

01:57:18.564 --> 01:57:19.999
DOES NOT ADDRESS ENOUGH OF IT

01:57:20.066 --> 01:57:21.100
BUT THAT WE CAN DEAL WITH IN

01:57:21.167 --> 01:57:24.070
THAT NEXT BILL BUT I JUST THINK.

01:57:24.137 --> 01:57:24.704
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO BRING IT

01:57:24.771 --> 01:57:26.939
UP -- BUT I THINK IT'S ALSO

01:57:27.006 --> 01:57:27.607
IMPORTANT FOR MY COLLEAGUES HAVE

01:57:27.673 --> 01:57:29.842
BEEN -- MENTIONED THAT WE HAVE

01:57:29.909 --> 01:57:31.511
TO BE CAREFUL NOT.

01:57:31.577 --> 01:57:34.147
TO MAKE THIS TO ROSY THIS BILL

01:57:34.213 --> 01:57:35.548
WILL AND I'M GLAD WE GOT TO

01:57:35.615 --> 01:57:38.184
CLARIFICATION WILL IMPROVE OVER

01:57:38.251 --> 01:57:41.254
THE GRAPHS THAT WE GOT.

01:57:41.320 --> 01:57:44.390
FROM -- FIRST REISMAN SIMILAR TO

01:57:44.457 --> 01:57:45.224
GAVE US GRAPHS THAT SHOW A

01:57:45.291 --> 01:57:47.160
PRETTY SCARY PROJECTION OF RATE

01:57:47.226 --> 01:57:48.661
INCREASES.

01:57:48.728 --> 01:57:51.731
THIS BILL WILL HELP TO NOT SO

01:57:51.798 --> 01:57:53.099
THAT WE DON'T HIT THAT SCARY

01:57:53.166 --> 01:57:54.700
PROJECTION BUT IT WILL NOT

01:57:54.767 --> 01:57:56.402
ELIMINATE ALL READING CREASES

01:57:56.469 --> 01:57:57.270
BECAUSE IF WE'RE GOING TO

01:57:57.336 --> 01:57:58.805
ACTUALLY IMPROVE SAFETY WE'RE

01:57:58.871 --> 01:57:59.806
GOING TO HAVE TO SPEND SOME

01:57:59.872 --> 01:58:00.773
MONEY.

01:58:00.840 --> 01:58:03.476
AND FOR ACTUALLY GET A HOLD THE

01:58:03.543 --> 01:58:06.212
UTILITIES ACCOUNTABLE MEANING

01:58:06.279 --> 01:58:08.114
YOU THE PROPER SAFETY CULTURE

01:58:08.181 --> 01:58:09.315
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SPEND

01:58:09.382 --> 01:58:10.116
SOME MONEY BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA

01:58:10.183 --> 01:58:11.684
HAVE TO INCREASE OUR OWN

01:58:11.751 --> 01:58:13.853
EXPERTISE AND THAT WILL REQUIRE

01:58:13.920 --> 01:58:15.154
HIRING SOME PEOPLE.

01:58:15.221 --> 01:58:16.856
SO.

01:58:16.923 --> 01:58:17.356
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO RATE

01:58:17.423 --> 01:58:18.424
INCREASES.

01:58:18.491 --> 01:58:20.893
BUT I THINK THIS BY TAKING THIS

01:58:20.960 --> 01:58:27.333
ACTION NOW WE ARE GOING. TO TO

01:58:27.400 --> 01:58:30.069
GIVE US SOME -- ALL OF OUR ONE

01:58:30.136 --> 01:58:32.271
EASTWARD INSURANCE BUT SOME.

01:58:32.338 --> 01:58:33.172
QUESTION FROM THAT HORRIBLE

01:58:33.239 --> 01:58:33.973
PROJECTION THAT ARE ON THOSE

01:58:34.040 --> 01:58:38.711
GRAPHS THAT YOU SHOWED US -- THE%

01:58:38.778 --> 01:58:40.446
OTHER THING I LIKE ABOUT THE

01:58:40.513 --> 01:58:41.848
BILL AS AMENDED IS THAT IT

01:58:41.914 --> 01:58:43.816
COVERS THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN

01:58:43.883 --> 01:58:45.818
FIRE VICTIMS THE ORIGINAL BILL

01:58:45.885 --> 01:58:46.819
DID NOT.

01:58:46.886 --> 01:58:49.956
AND I APPRECIATE THAT SO THERE'S

01:58:50.022 --> 01:58:51.557
MUCH IN HERE THAT I THINK FOR

01:58:51.624 --> 01:58:54.293
IMPROVEMENTS AND THE ONLY THING

01:58:54.360 --> 01:58:55.228
I WOULD SPEAK TO IS.

01:58:55.294 --> 01:58:58.197
A YOU KNOW I'M NOT A FAN OF OUR

01:58:58.264 --> 01:58:59.365
CURRENT UTILITY MODEL.

01:58:59.432 --> 01:59:01.601
I DON'T THINK THAT IT ESPECIALLY

01:59:01.667 --> 01:59:04.003
GIVEN THE TYPE OF CHANGES THAT

01:59:04.070 --> 01:59:05.838
WE HAVE BEEN MAKING TO TRUST OUR

01:59:05.905 --> 01:59:08.374
WHOLE WAY OF OF GENERATING

01:59:08.441 --> 01:59:10.977
ELECTRICITY OF WHO PURCHASES

01:59:11.043 --> 01:59:12.678
PURCHASES IT OF WHO DELIVERS

01:59:12.745 --> 01:59:13.946
ENERGY SERVICES.

01:59:14.013 --> 01:59:15.414
THE FACT THAT WE HAVE EMBRACE

01:59:15.481 --> 01:59:18.518
THE ENERGY SERVICES ARE FAR MORE

01:59:18.584 --> 01:59:20.152
THAN JUST THE DELIVERY OF ENERGY.

01:59:20.219 --> 01:59:23.990
BUT I THINK THAT RIGHT NOW WE WE

01:59:24.056 --> 01:59:26.926
TO THINK ABOUT EXACTLY HOW.

01:59:26.993 --> 01:59:29.428
WHAT IS THE APPROPRIATE RIGHT

01:59:29.495 --> 01:59:31.330
MODEL FOR CALIFORNIA THAT TAKES

01:59:31.397 --> 01:59:32.899
A LOT MORE TIME?

01:59:32.965 --> 01:59:34.767
AND WE'RE IN A SITUATION NOW

01:59:34.834 --> 01:59:36.702
WHERE WE HAVE FIRE YOU STRUCTURE

01:59:36.769 --> 01:59:39.372
AS IT EXISTS SO WE NEED TO ACT

01:59:39.438 --> 01:59:42.041
TO MAKE SURE THAT THE STRUCTURE

01:59:42.108 --> 01:59:43.376
THAT WE HAVE AS EXIST.

01:59:43.442 --> 01:59:46.245
UNTIL WE HAVE DONE THE PROPER

01:59:46.312 --> 01:59:48.648
TIME PROPER WORK TO FIGURE OUT

01:59:48.714 --> 01:59:50.316
WHAT IT WOULD REPLACE IT.

01:59:50.383 --> 01:59:52.118
THAT DOESN'T EXIST NOW WE NEED

01:59:52.184 --> 01:59:55.154
IT TO BE DELIVERING THE SERVICE

01:59:55.221 --> 01:59:56.656
AS BEST AS POSSIBLE WITH THE

01:59:56.722 --> 01:59:58.658
SAFETY CULTURE AND WITH THE

01:59:58.724 --> 02:00:01.494
LEAST -- DAMAGE IN TERMS A RAINY

02:00:01.561 --> 02:00:04.163
CREASES TO OUR REGULAR

02:00:04.230 --> 02:00:06.198
CALIFORNIANS WILL WE SEE REPAIRS

02:00:06.265 --> 02:00:07.366
WE MEAN REGULAR CALIFORNIA.

02:00:07.433 --> 02:00:09.635
SO THAT'S WHY I LIKE THE BILL

02:00:09.702 --> 02:00:10.903
NOW BECAUSE WE'RE IN THIS

02:00:10.970 --> 02:00:13.239
IMMEDIATE CRISIS NOW.

02:00:13.306 --> 02:00:14.907
BUT I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING ON

02:00:14.974 --> 02:00:16.509
SOMETHING IN THE FUTURE THAT MAY

02:00:16.576 --> 02:00:19.579
BE MORE DRAMATIC.

02:00:19.645 --> 02:00:21.681
THANK YOU.

02:00:21.747 --> 02:00:22.815

02:00:29.689 --> 02:00:30.823
CRITICAL. TO TO BE ABLE TO PUT

02:00:30.890 --> 02:00:34.760
SOMETHING FORWARD -- THIS POLICY

02:00:34.827 --> 02:00:36.395
IS GOING TO BE A HUGE SHIFT ON

02:00:36.462 --> 02:00:38.731
OUR OF STATES RULES ON WILDFIRE

02:00:38.798 --> 02:00:40.800
AND UTILITIES BUT I GOTTA BE

02:00:40.866 --> 02:00:42.368

IMPACT ON RATE PAYERS I KNOW

02:00:48.541 --> 02:00:49.575
CENTER SKINNER.

WAS TALKING ABOUT THAT AND I

02:00:50.876 --> 02:00:52.912

02:00:56.248 --> 02:00:58.117
CONCERNS.

THERE'S A TON OF MOVING PARTS

02:01:10.496 --> 02:01:13.599
AND I STILL HAVE TO CONSIDER THE

02:01:13.666 --> 02:01:16.068
IMPACT ON RATE PAYERS AND AND

02:01:16.135 --> 02:01:18.471

COMMENTS BUT I TWO ONE APPLAUD

02:01:35.955 --> 02:01:37.023
THE AUTHORS AND THE MEASURE THAT

02:01:37.089 --> 02:01:37.823
WE HAVE BEFORE US BECAUSE OF THE

02:01:37.890 --> 02:01:40.826
INDIVIDUAL WHO WORK FOR UTILITY

02:01:40.893 --> 02:01:42.094
COMPANY IF YOU WOULD.

02:01:42.161 --> 02:01:42.995
IF I WOULD IT YOU ASKED ME A

02:01:43.062 --> 02:01:45.297
YEAR AGO FIVE YEARS AGO TEN

02:01:45.364 --> 02:01:46.666
YEARS AGO THAT YOU WOULD TAKE.

02:01:46.732 --> 02:01:49.535
HOW THE BILL WITH THE UTILITIES

02:01:49.602 --> 02:01:50.636
TAKING SUCH?

02:01:50.703 --> 02:01:52.138
OWNERSHIP.

02:01:52.204 --> 02:01:54.073
OF LIABILITY AND YOUR

02:01:54.140 --> 02:01:56.175
SHAREHOLDERS -- PEEN LE LEVEL

EXECUTIVES TAKING THESE

02:01:59.178 --> 02:02:00.913
COMPENSATION IT I WOULD SAY IT

02:02:00.980 --> 02:02:01.681
WOULD NEVER HAPPEN.

02:02:01.747 --> 02:02:03.983
BECAUSE THAT WAS NOT THE CULTURE

02:02:04.050 --> 02:02:06.986
OF INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES I

02:02:07.053 --> 02:02:09.221
JEERED UTILITIES IN ASSEMBLY AND

02:02:09.288 --> 02:02:10.389
WE HAD TO SAN BRUNO.

02:02:10.456 --> 02:02:12.925
HEARING AND WE FOUGHT.

02:02:12.992 --> 02:02:14.994
FOR RATE SHAREHOLDERS TO PAY

02:02:15.061 --> 02:02:16.662
THAT LIABILITY WE'RE SUCCESSFUL

02:02:16.729 --> 02:02:18.998
THERE BUT PART OF THAT -- YOU

02:02:19.065 --> 02:02:20.700
VERY RARELY GET SHAREHOLDERS

02:02:20.766 --> 02:02:22.735
EVER TAKE A HIT ON ANY OF THE

02:02:22.802 --> 02:02:25.538
LIABILITIES ACOSTA -- UTILITIES

02:02:25.604 --> 02:02:26.605
MIGHT OF COST I WOULD BE VERY

02:02:26.672 --> 02:02:28.774
CLEAR UTILITIES ARE NOT CAUSING

02:02:28.841 --> 02:02:31.277
ANY MORE FIRES TODAY THAN THEY

02:02:31.343 --> 02:02:32.411
DID TWENTY YEARS AGO.

02:02:32.478 --> 02:02:33.045
THEIR EQUIPMENT IS NOT CAUSING

02:02:33.112 --> 02:02:35.047
ANY MORE WHAT WE HAVE IS A

02:02:35.114 --> 02:02:36.849
CLIMATE CHANGE WE ALL BELIEVE IN

02:02:36.916 --> 02:02:37.817
CLIMATE CHANGE WE HAVE A

02:02:37.883 --> 02:02:38.984
DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT OUT THERE.

02:02:39.051 --> 02:02:41.153
WE HAVE.

02:02:41.220 --> 02:02:42.822
ODD TREES THAT ARE NOT BEING

02:02:42.888 --> 02:02:44.990
MANAGED I MEAN EVEN CONGRESSMAN

02:02:45.057 --> 02:02:46.425
GARAMENDI SAYS WE HAVE DONE A

02:02:46.492 --> 02:02:49.228
POOR JOB AT MANAGING OUR FORCED

02:02:49.295 --> 02:02:51.230
AND THAT'S A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR

02:02:51.297 --> 02:02:53.132
AS WELL.

02:02:53.199 --> 02:02:55.901
SO THAT'S WHY I WAS HASN'T IT AT

02:02:55.968 --> 02:02:58.537
FIRST ON TRYING TO JUST.

02:02:58.604 --> 02:03:00.740
BANG BANG BANG ON THE UTILITY

02:03:00.806 --> 02:03:02.007
AND SAY THEY HAVE A 100%

02:03:02.074 --> 02:03:03.576
LIABILITY ON THIS THING YES THEY

02:03:03.642 --> 02:03:06.112
HAVE SOME RESPONSIBILITY AND I

02:03:06.178 --> 02:03:07.947
THINK THIS MESS -- THIS BILL.

02:03:08.013 --> 02:03:09.815
HOLD HIM TO THAT MAKES HIM PAY

02:03:09.882 --> 02:03:11.817
THEIR FAIR SHARE MY CONCERN IS

02:03:11.884 --> 02:03:15.488
ALSO THOSE -- SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN

02:03:15.554 --> 02:03:16.789
FIRE VICTIMS AND MAKING SURE

02:03:16.856 --> 02:03:19.258
THAT THEY'RE PAID QUICKLY AND DO

02:03:19.325 --> 02:03:20.960
WE HAVE ANY TIME FRAME ON HOW

02:03:21.026 --> 02:03:23.229
SOON THEY WILL BE MADE WHOLE

02:03:23.295 --> 02:03:24.764
BECAUSE THE SEE IT IN THIS.

02:03:24.830 --> 02:03:26.465
BILL AND THEY STILL WAIT TWO OR

02:03:26.532 --> 02:03:28.334
THREE YEARS DOWN THE ROAD WE

02:03:28.400 --> 02:03:30.035
HAVE REALLY NOT HELP THEM IF

02:03:30.102 --> 02:03:30.870
THAT'S THE CASE.

02:03:30.936 --> 02:03:35.541
AND MY OTHER CONCERN EVEN THOUGH

02:03:35.608 --> 02:03:38.010
THIS BILL DOES NOT ADDRESS IT IS.

02:03:38.077 --> 02:03:38.911
MY FEAR OF A HEDGE FUNDS OF

02:03:38.978 --> 02:03:40.713
COMING IN AND CAL CANNIBALIZING

02:03:40.780 --> 02:03:42.348
UTILITIES WHETHER IT'S P. GINNY

02:03:42.414 --> 02:03:44.016
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON THE

02:03:44.083 --> 02:03:46.051
GAS COMPANY -- I I I I WISH WE

02:03:46.118 --> 02:03:48.120
HAD A BETTER STAY IN THE METHOD

02:03:48.187 --> 02:03:49.421
OF HOW WE FIND.

02:03:49.488 --> 02:03:52.124
THIS PAY OUT BECAUSE I AM FAVOR

02:03:52.191 --> 02:03:54.226
OF THE EQUITY CONTRIBUTION BOND

02:03:54.293 --> 02:03:56.762
BUT I UNDERSTAND THIS BILL DOES

02:03:56.829 --> 02:03:57.696
NOT ADDRESS THAT.

02:03:57.763 --> 02:03:59.231
AND THOSE ARE THE CONCERNS I

02:03:59.298 --> 02:04:02.701
HAVE GOING FOR BECAUSE IF IT

02:04:02.768 --> 02:04:03.335
WOULD LOOKED IT UP TO THE HEDGE

02:04:03.402 --> 02:04:04.570
FUNDS.

02:04:04.637 --> 02:04:06.005
I'M FEARFUL WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO

02:04:06.071 --> 02:04:08.374
NOT ONLY.

02:04:08.440 --> 02:04:09.308
PJ BUT ARE INVESTOR OWNED

02:04:09.375 --> 02:04:10.442
UTILITIES AS A WHOLE AND WE

02:04:10.509 --> 02:04:12.211
SHOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT

02:04:12.278 --> 02:04:14.380
BECAUSE SENATOR ARE HERTZBERG

02:04:14.446 --> 02:04:16.282
AND I BOTH LIVE TO THE ENERGY

02:04:16.348 --> 02:04:18.217
CRISIS HE AS THE SPEAKER AND I

02:04:18.284 --> 02:04:19.084
AS AN EMPLOYEE OF EDISON.

02:04:19.151 --> 02:04:21.020
AND THE LAST THING YOU WANT IS

02:04:21.086 --> 02:04:23.222
ANOTHER CRISIS BASED ON FUNDING

02:04:23.289 --> 02:04:24.723
AND RELIABILITY AND THE TWO

02:04:24.790 --> 02:04:26.292
THINGS THAT UTILITIES ARE

02:04:26.358 --> 02:04:28.227
CONCERNED ABOUT DESPITE WHAT YOU

02:04:28.294 --> 02:04:30.029
MIGHT READ IS SAFETY AND

02:04:30.095 --> 02:04:31.096
RELIABILITY.

02:04:31.163 --> 02:04:32.298
THOSE ARE ALWAYS THE TWO TOP

02:04:32.364 --> 02:04:35.067
PILLARS OF ANY UTILITY COMPANY

02:04:35.134 --> 02:04:37.102
SAFETY A RIB RELIABILITY PROFITS

02:04:37.169 --> 02:04:38.971
ALWAYS THIRTY MIGHT NOT COME OUT

02:04:39.038 --> 02:04:40.139
LIKE THAT BUT THEY'VE ALWAYS

02:04:40.206 --> 02:04:42.274
CHAMPION SAFETY AND RELIABILITY

UNIVERSE WHICH OF COURSE

02:06:13.999 --> 02:06:15.467
INCLUDES OUR BUSINESSES THAT ARE

02:06:15.534 --> 02:06:16.368

02:06:18.871 --> 02:06:20.406
FORCING SOME OF THEM TO MAKE AS

EXECUTIVE DECISIONS TO TO MOVE

02:06:22.341 --> 02:06:23.375

HEARD FROM MY ONE OF THE MEMBERS

02:06:26.278 --> 02:06:27.513
AND NOT IN OPPOSITION THAT THEY

02:06:27.579 --> 02:06:29.348
WERE HOPING.

02:06:29.415 --> 02:06:31.083
AFTER THIS -- FEE THAT WAS

02:06:31.150 --> 02:06:33.319
PAYING OFF BONDS WOULD BE GONE

02:06:33.385 --> 02:06:34.453

EXPAND YEAR AFTER YEAR.

02:06:41.160 --> 02:06:43.662

SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY --

02:08:08.013 --> 02:08:10.082

BUT YOU PUT A PROVISION THAT

02:08:56.728 --> 02:08:57.763
REQUIRES AS PART OF THE CLOTHES

02:08:57.830 --> 02:08:59.298
THAT THAT MEANS PART OF THE

02:09:00.732 --> 02:09:02.201
THIS HAS TO BE THAT THEY HAVE TO

02:09:02.267 --> 02:09:04.336
AGREE TO THIS -- INSURANCE FUND

02:09:04.403 --> 02:09:05.838

TO SUPPORT THIS MEASURE.

02:09:11.510 --> 02:09:12.811
BUT WE'VE WORKED WITH ALL THREE

02:09:12.878 --> 02:09:14.179
UTILITIES BOTH IN TERMS OF THE

02:09:14.246 --> 02:09:15.414
CONSTRUCT OF THE UTILITIES AS

02:09:15.481 --> 02:09:17.749
WELL AS THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE

02:09:17.816 --> 02:09:19.384
RELATIVE COST OF THINKING ABOUT

02:09:19.451 --> 02:09:21.086
THE CENTERS POINT PART OF THE

02:09:21.153 --> 02:09:23.155
BECAUSE OF THERE'S A RECOGNITION

02:09:23.222 --> 02:09:24.590
OF WORSE AND GAS ELECTRIC WHICH

02:09:24.656 --> 02:09:25.557
IS WHY THEY WOULD HAVE.

02:09:25.624 --> 02:09:27.025
THE SMALL SHARE CONTRIBUTION TO

02:09:27.092 --> 02:09:28.393
THE FUND SO WE WORK WITH ALL

THREE UTILITIES AND WE

02:09:29.428 --> 02:09:31.096
UNDERSTAND THAT THEY SEE THIS AS

02:09:31.163 --> 02:09:32.965
A SALUTE THERE'S A PATH FORWARD

02:09:33.031 --> 02:09:34.399
YEAH BECAUSE IT THE REALITY IS

02:09:34.466 --> 02:09:34.833
IT IN.

02:09:34.900 --> 02:09:35.901
ALLOCATING THIS RECORD YOUR

02:09:35.968 --> 02:09:38.003
ALLOCATION FORMULA IT'S ABOUT

THE INSURANCE FUND PARTICULARLY

02:10:12.971 --> 02:10:14.306

02:10:46.138 --> 02:10:47.272
OF ENGAGEMENT HERE I AM ONE OF

02:10:47.339 --> 02:10:48.974
THOSE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN FIRE

02:10:49.041 --> 02:10:52.344
VICTIMS -- SO ARE MY BEST

02:10:52.411 --> 02:10:53.946
FRIENDS IN MY HIGH SCHOOL

02:10:54.012 --> 02:10:55.847
ENGLISH TEACHER AND EVERYONE IN

02:10:55.914 --> 02:10:57.182
THE NEIGHBORHOOD I GREW UP IN

02:10:57.249 --> 02:10:58.550
AND WHEN THE GOVERNOR

02:10:58.617 --> 02:10:58.850
[inaudible]

02:10:58.917 --> 02:11:01.220
SHOWED UP.

02:11:01.286 --> 02:11:04.089
WHEN HE FIRST TOOK OFFICE?

02:11:04.156 --> 02:11:06.925
ANY PROMISED THAT HE WAS GONNA.

02:11:06.992 --> 02:11:09.027
ADDRESS THIS CHALLENGE.

02:11:09.094 --> 02:11:10.262
I DIDN'T EXPECT IT.

02:11:10.329 --> 02:11:12.998
WOULD BE HERE TODAY.

02:11:13.065 --> 02:11:14.533
AND THE THE COMPLEXITY OF A WHAT

02:11:14.600 --> 02:11:16.368
IT MEANS TO ACT ON A CHALLENGE

02:11:16.435 --> 02:11:20.105
THIS COMPLEX IS IS OBVIOUS

02:11:20.172 --> 02:11:20.405
[inaudible]

02:11:20.472 --> 02:11:23.275
BUT TWENTY BILLS TONGUE WHEN THE

02:11:23.342 --> 02:11:25.911
PRESIDENT CAME TO TOWN AND DID

02:11:25.978 --> 02:11:27.346
THE RIGHT THING AND THEN PUT

02:11:27.412 --> 02:11:30.349
POLITICS INTO AN EMERGENCY.

02:11:30.415 --> 02:11:31.783
AND THEN PUT THE DILIGENCE IN

02:11:31.850 --> 02:11:33.852
WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE.

02:11:33.919 --> 02:11:35.821
AND THE TEAM HE BROUGHT ON THE

02:11:35.887 --> 02:11:37.155
FIRST CLASS.

02:11:37.222 --> 02:11:38.991
TEAM HE BROUGHT ON TO ACTUALLY

02:11:39.057 --> 02:11:41.793
WORK ON MECHANICS HERE -- IN THE

02:11:41.860 --> 02:11:45.464
COALITION THAT YOU ALL OF BILL.

02:11:45.530 --> 02:11:45.697
I THINK.

02:11:45.764 --> 02:11:50.669
THERE'S REPEATING. TO HAVE A

02:11:50.736 --> 02:11:54.439
COALITION THAT INCLUDES VICTIMS.

02:11:54.506 --> 02:11:55.774
AND RATE PAYER ADVOCATES.

02:11:55.841 --> 02:11:58.543
AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY.

02:11:58.610 --> 02:12:00.145
ELEMENT PROGRESSING UTILITY

02:12:00.212 --> 02:12:02.180
INDUSTRY EVEN I DON'T KNOW HOW

02:12:02.247 --> 02:12:04.883
YOU YOU PULL THIS OFF TO BE

02:12:04.950 --> 02:12:08.153
HONEST MISS BONTA SANTOS -- AND

02:12:08.220 --> 02:12:10.289
NOW THIS GOVERNOR DID IT VOTE --

02:12:10.355 --> 02:12:12.391
HE DELIVERED ON HIS PROMISE.

02:12:12.457 --> 02:12:13.558
NOW.

02:12:13.625 --> 02:12:14.593
IS THERE PROMISE FULLY MET NOT

02:12:14.660 --> 02:12:15.794
YET.

02:12:15.861 --> 02:12:20.198
WE ARE WORK TO DO -- BUT I TRUST

02:12:20.265 --> 02:12:22.000
NOW IN THIS ADMINISTRATION AT

02:12:22.067 --> 02:12:23.502
THEIR WORD IS GOOD AND THEN WHEN

02:12:23.568 --> 02:12:24.936
HE WALKED THROUGH THOSE ASHES

02:12:25.003 --> 02:12:26.138
THAT WAS.

02:12:26.204 --> 02:12:29.908
NOT A PHOTO OP -- SO I THINK THE

02:12:29.975 --> 02:12:30.942
AUTHORS FOR BRINGING THIS

02:12:31.009 --> 02:12:32.311
FORWARD BECAUSE THIS IS VERY

02:12:32.377 --> 02:12:34.246
REAL FOR MANY PEOPLE.

02:12:34.313 --> 02:12:38.850
AND THE NOTION SOMEHOW THAT --

02:12:38.917 --> 02:12:40.652
VICTIMS.

02:12:40.719 --> 02:12:42.020
ARE GOING TO BE BETTER OFF

02:12:42.087 --> 02:12:43.855
WITHOUT US MOVING A MEASURE HERE

02:12:43.922 --> 02:12:45.290
I THINK IS FALSE I KNOW IT'S AN

02:12:45.357 --> 02:12:47.259
ANXIETY PRODUCING EFFORT ACT AND

02:12:47.326 --> 02:12:48.694

02:12:48.760 --> 02:12:50.329
WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN

02:12:50.395 --> 02:12:52.831
FRANCISCO THAT THERE'S SERIOUS.

02:12:52.898 --> 02:12:55.334
CHALLENGES THAT REMAIN AND I'M

02:12:55.400 --> 02:12:57.102
FRUSTRATED AND I KNOW WHETHER

02:12:57.169 --> 02:12:59.838
IT'S A CLASSY INSURANCE MARKETS.

02:12:59.905 --> 02:13:00.972
WHETHER IT'S THE OPPORTUNITY IS

02:13:01.039 --> 02:13:02.407
NOT SEIZED IN THE ENERGY IS

02:13:02.474 --> 02:13:03.709
ATION AND USING D. E. R.

02:13:03.775 --> 02:13:05.243

COMMUNITIES AND ACTUALLY EMPOWER

02:13:06.912 --> 02:13:08.447
PEOPLE TO FEEL SAFE.

02:13:08.513 --> 02:13:10.549
THE STRUCTURAL ISSUES THE MOST

TO RECOGNIZE HERE TODAY THAT THE

02:13:24.062 --> 02:13:27.332
COST OF INACTION IS TOO GREAT.

02:13:27.399 --> 02:13:28.667
AND THERE'S TOO MANY PEOPLE WITH

02:13:28.734 --> 02:13:30.602
THEIR LIVELIHOOD AND THEIR LIVES

02:13:30.669 --> 02:13:32.704

BUT IT'S NOT DONE.

02:13:53.325 --> 02:13:55.660
AND THE CHALLENGES AROUND.

02:13:55.727 --> 02:13:57.662
NOT THE FORESTRY IN THE NORTH

02:13:57.729 --> 02:13:59.998
COAST NO AND AND NOT THE THE

02:14:00.065 --> 02:14:01.867
DEEP BIG TREES WHICH WE ALL KNOW

02:14:03.435 --> 02:14:05.237
ISSUES IS RESOURCES CHAIR WE ARE

02:14:05.303 --> 02:14:06.471

02:14:07.773 --> 02:14:08.874
URBAN INTERFACE.

02:14:08.940 --> 02:14:10.108
THOSE PEOPLE LIVING IN HILLSIDE

02:14:10.175 --> 02:14:12.144
COMMUNITIES WHERE THE RISK IS TO

02:14:12.210 --> 02:14:14.913
REAL WERE INSURANCES CAN'T BEING

02:14:14.980 --> 02:14:17.282
CANCELED OR NON RENEWED -- WE'VE

02:14:17.349 --> 02:14:19.184

02:14:19.251 --> 02:14:20.952
WORK TO DO FOR THE REST OF THIS

02:14:21.019 --> 02:14:21.553
SESSION.

02:14:21.620 --> 02:14:23.188
WE'VE GOT TO FIND OTHER REVENUES

02:14:23.255 --> 02:14:25.690
OTHER STRUCTURES ACTUALLY HARDEN

02:14:25.757 --> 02:14:28.894
NOTCHES HOMES BUT COMMUNITIES --

02:14:28.960 --> 02:14:30.362
AND WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:14:30.429 --> 02:14:31.830
THOSE VICTIMS HAVE SOME HOPE IN

02:14:31.897 --> 02:14:34.433
THE FUTURE WHAT I SEE HERE IS.

02:14:34.499 --> 02:14:36.368
A RATE PAYER BY IN THE PALES IN

02:14:36.435 --> 02:14:38.270
COMPARISON TO A SHAREHOLDER BY

02:14:38.336 --> 02:14:40.372
IN A FRAMEWORK.

02:14:40.439 --> 02:14:43.241
THAT FAVORS VICTIMS.

02:14:43.308 --> 02:14:45.377
ARM AND SOME HOPE.

02:14:45.444 --> 02:14:47.446
MECHANICS ARE HARD.

02:14:47.512 --> 02:14:49.815
IT IS A COMPLEX BILL.

02:14:49.881 --> 02:14:50.682
BUT THAT'S WE GET PAID TO DO

02:14:50.749 --> 02:14:52.417
HERE.

02:14:52.484 --> 02:14:54.820
AND SO I'M JUST.

02:14:54.886 --> 02:14:56.788
I'M HUMBLED BY THE THE GRAVITY

02:14:56.855 --> 02:14:58.723

TALENT. TO SERVE -- TO TO BE

02:18:36.574 --> 02:18:37.909
PART OF THE SOLUTION.

02:18:37.976 --> 02:18:40.178
IN SAN DIEGO THE MESSAGES.

02:18:40.245 --> 02:18:41.746
WE'RE GOING TO DO EVERYTHING WE

02:18:41.813 --> 02:18:43.214

EFFORT AND IN HERE WE WE HAVE A

02:18:47.018 --> 02:18:47.952
PROVISION.

02:18:48.019 --> 02:18:50.355
PUNISHING THERE THE THEM AND ARE

02:18:50.422 --> 02:18:51.990
THE WAY THEY COMPENSATE.

HARDER WHAT WILDFIRES.

02:19:04.169 --> 02:19:05.370
AND AND I DISAGREE WITH THAT

02:19:05.437 --> 02:19:06.304
PART OF THE BILL I THINK IT'S

02:19:06.371 --> 02:19:07.806
GOING TO HAVE UNINTENDED

02:19:07.872 --> 02:19:09.808
CONSEQUENCES GOING DOWN THE LINE.

02:19:09.874 --> 02:19:12.043
ESPECIALLY FOR MY UTILITY.

02:19:12.110 --> 02:19:13.812

02:19:16.181 --> 02:19:17.716
AND AND P. GINNY THAT NEED SO

02:19:17.782 --> 02:19:18.516
IT'S KIND OF CODES BECAUSE THEY

02:19:18.583 --> 02:19:20.318
HAVE THEY HAVE STRUGGLED WITH

02:19:20.385 --> 02:19:22.821
THE HAVING A SAFETY CULTURE.

02:19:22.887 --> 02:19:25.557
OF I DON'T I CAN'T SAY THAT FOR

FOR SAN DIEGO AND I DON'T KNOW

02:19:26.725 --> 02:19:28.593
WHY WERE PUNISHING THEM.

02:19:28.660 --> 02:19:30.762
BUT LARGELY IF YOU READ THIS

02:19:30.829 --> 02:19:31.963
BILL.

02:19:32.030 --> 02:19:33.198
IF YOU LOOK AT THE PROVISIONS OF

02:19:33.264 --> 02:19:34.566
FAT BILL.

02:19:34.632 --> 02:19:35.667
AND IF YOU GO THROUGH THE

02:19:35.734 --> 02:19:37.168
PROVISIONS THIS IS.

02:19:37.235 --> 02:19:42.173
A BILL THAT EMPHASIZES PUTS.

02:19:42.240 --> 02:19:44.409
UP MAKES OF A VALUE STATEMENT

02:19:44.476 --> 02:19:46.311
ABOUT HOW THREATENING WILDFIRES

02:19:46.377 --> 02:19:48.413
ARE AND WHAT WE NEED TO DO THE

02:19:48.480 --> 02:19:49.414
HARD IN THE GRID.

02:19:49.481 --> 02:19:51.883
AND THE THE BILL TALKS ABOUT HOW

02:19:51.950 --> 02:19:53.084
WE'RE GOING TO HARD IN THE GRILL.

02:19:53.151 --> 02:19:54.219
GRID.

02:19:54.285 --> 02:19:56.354
AND AND HOW WE'RE GOING TO HOLD

02:19:56.421 --> 02:19:57.655
THE CHILES OF ACCOUNTABLE FOR

HARD IN THE GRID.

02:19:58.823 --> 02:20:00.258
BUT MANY THE REASONS ARE GREAT

02:20:00.325 --> 02:20:02.327
IS IS IS WEEKEND IS BECAUSE OF

02:20:02.393 --> 02:20:04.562
THE UC HAS NOT AUTHORIZED.

02:20:04.629 --> 02:20:06.131
A LOT OF THOSE INFRASTRUCTURE

02:20:06.197 --> 02:20:07.465
IMPROVEMENTS BECAUSE THEY

02:20:07.532 --> 02:20:09.000
INCREASE RATES.

02:20:09.067 --> 02:20:10.902

TALKING ABOUT IT YOU KNOW OF

02:20:13.972 --> 02:20:16.040
SURE THE STRENGTHENING THE GRANT

02:20:16.107 --> 02:20:17.909
THAT COSTS MONEY AND THEY TALK

02:20:17.976 --> 02:20:20.078
ABOUT A PERFECT WORLD IN A

02:20:20.145 --> 02:20:21.613

02:20:24.816 --> 02:20:26.184
THANK KEEPING RATES LOW I THINK

02:20:26.251 --> 02:20:27.485

ADVOCATES ARE ALWAYS FIGHTING

02:20:35.426 --> 02:20:38.163
FOR KEEP RATES LOW BECAUSE

02:20:38.229 --> 02:20:42.033
HAVING LOW RATES ARE ESSENTIAL.

02:20:42.100 --> 02:20:44.035

FOR POWER HAVE POWER IN THEIR

02:20:49.574 --> 02:20:50.842

02:24:42.373 --> 02:24:43.341
THE ONE BEFORE US.

02:24:43.408 --> 02:24:45.109
BUT THIS WASN'T DONE BY ANY ONE

02:24:45.176 --> 02:24:47.045
OF US IT WAS DONE BY ALL OF US

02:24:47.111 --> 02:24:49.313
WHO WERE WILLING TO ENGAGE.

02:24:49.380 --> 02:24:51.516
I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR I

02:24:59.223 --> 02:25:01.192
HOLDEN AND A SOME OF OUR BURKE

02:25:01.259 --> 02:25:03.027
WE SPENT WAY TOO MUCH TIME

02:25:03.094 --> 02:25:05.563
TOGETHER OVER THIS -- AND ALSO I

02:25:05.630 --> 02:25:07.498
A LOT OF PRAISE NEEDS TO GO OUT

02:25:07.565 --> 02:25:09.233
TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF FOR THE

02:25:09.300 --> 02:25:10.535
WORK THAT THEY HAVE DONE THEY'VE

02:25:10.601 --> 02:25:12.370
LISTENED TO ALL OF US AND THEY

02:25:12.437 --> 02:25:14.872
PRESENTED US WITH A FRAMEWORK.

02:25:14.939 --> 02:25:15.473
FOR THIS LEGISLATURE TO BE ACT

02:25:15.540 --> 02:25:17.842
ON FOR THOSE WHO SPOKE UP BUT

02:25:17.909 --> 02:25:18.776
TODAY AND SAID THAT THEY WERE

02:25:18.843 --> 02:25:20.411
NOT I'M GOING TO BE ABLE TO

02:25:20.478 --> 02:25:21.512
SUPPORT THIS TODAY BECAUSE THERE

02:25:21.579 --> 02:25:23.214
WAS A THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT

02:25:23.281 --> 02:25:24.348
IT THAT WASN'T RIGHT IT WAS A

02:25:24.415 --> 02:25:26.050
MISSED OPPORTUNITY OR MAYBE.

02:25:26.117 --> 02:25:26.651
THERE'S A CALM ON THE WRONG

02:25:26.717 --> 02:25:28.486
PLACE OR PERIOD IN THE WRONG

02:25:28.553 --> 02:25:30.054
PLACE OR OR MAYBE THEY JUST

02:25:30.121 --> 02:25:31.989
DON'T TRUST THE ADMINISTRATION

02:25:32.056 --> 02:25:32.623
EITHER SOMETHING IN HERE BECAUSE

02:25:32.690 --> 02:25:34.659
IT IS -- VOLUMINOUS AND THEY

02:25:34.725 --> 02:25:35.993
THEY'RE SCARED THERE'S SOMETHING

02:25:36.060 --> 02:25:37.128
IN HERE THAT COULD CAUSE THEM

02:25:37.195 --> 02:25:38.930
SOME POLITICAL TROUBLE I WOULD

02:25:38.996 --> 02:25:40.898
ASK YOU A TODAY. TO BE ABLE TO

02:25:40.965 --> 02:25:43.067
SUPPORT BY THIS MEASURE I DO

02:25:43.134 --> 02:25:45.736
BELIEVE THAT -- THAT THIS IF WE

02:25:45.803 --> 02:25:47.839
DON'T FIX THIS PROBLEM IT COULD

02:25:47.905 --> 02:25:49.807
BE AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT TO

02:25:49.874 --> 02:25:50.708
CALIFORNIA.

02:25:50.775 --> 02:25:53.010
TODAY IT IS OUR TURN TO ACT IT

02:25:53.077 --> 02:25:54.479
IS A RESPONSIBLE THING FOR BOTH

02:25:54.545 --> 02:25:56.481
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS TO BE

02:25:56.547 --> 02:25:57.949
ABLE TO STAND UP AND ACT ON

02:25:58.015 --> 02:26:03.287
BEHALF OF THE PEOPLE CALIFORNIA.

02:26:03.354 --> 02:26:06.324
AND SO I URGE AN AYE VOTE.

02:26:06.390 --> 02:26:07.458
I JUST WANT TO THANK THE SENATOR

02:26:07.525 --> 02:26:08.159
IS NOT JUST THE ONES THAT HAVE

02:26:08.226 --> 02:26:09.227
FOCUSED ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE

02:26:09.293 --> 02:26:10.595
BUT AS WELL SOME OF THE OTHERS

02:26:10.661 --> 02:26:12.630
SENATOR CENTER RUBIO FOR SOME OF

02:26:12.697 --> 02:26:14.532
YOUR CONCERNS AND INSURANCE --

02:26:14.599 --> 02:26:15.867
STERN FOR THE TIME YOU SPEND AND

02:26:15.933 --> 02:26:17.235
LOOKING AT ALL THE ISSUES

02:26:17.301 --> 02:26:19.670
SURROUNDING ISSUES -- I ALSO

02:26:19.737 --> 02:26:21.806
WANT TO APOLOGIZE TO THE VICTIMS

02:26:21.873 --> 02:26:24.675
I THINK WE WE FAILED ON ON SOME

02:26:24.742 --> 02:26:26.043
LEVEL THIS TOOK TOO LONG.

02:26:26.110 --> 02:26:27.445
ON THIS AND ALL OF THAT

02:26:27.512 --> 02:26:29.113
PREVENTION AND MITIGATION ISSUES

02:26:29.180 --> 02:26:30.081
THAT WERE GOING INTO IN

02:26:30.148 --> 02:26:31.349
INSURANCE ISSUES THAT WERE TAKEN

02:26:31.415 --> 02:26:33.251
SO LONG TO ADDRESS AND I THINK

02:26:33.317 --> 02:26:34.452
THEY DESERVE AN APOLOGY.

02:26:34.519 --> 02:26:36.187
OF FOURTEEN HUNDRED DAYS OUTSIDE

02:26:36.254 --> 02:26:38.589
OF YOUR HOME IS WAY TOO LONG

02:26:38.656 --> 02:26:40.358
PEOPLE JUST WANT TO GO HOME.

02:26:40.424 --> 02:26:41.225
THEY WANT TO MOVE BACK TO WHERE

02:26:41.292 --> 02:26:43.127
THEY RAISE THEIR FAMILIES WE MET

02:26:43.194 --> 02:26:44.362
KIDS IN PARADISE.

02:26:44.428 --> 02:26:46.364
THAT WERE AFRAID THAT THEY WOULD

02:26:46.430 --> 02:26:47.965
NEVER GO HOME.

02:26:48.032 --> 02:26:48.866
SO FOR THEM I APOLOGIZE TO ALL

02:26:48.933 --> 02:26:50.034
THE VICTIMS THAT ARE HERE TODAY

02:26:50.101 --> 02:26:51.702
AND TO THOSE THAT ARE THAT ARE

02:26:51.769 --> 02:26:54.172
NOT HERE TODAY -- BUT I THINK

02:26:54.238 --> 02:26:56.240
THIS MEASURE DOES SHOW THAT WE

02:26:56.307 --> 02:26:58.276
DO CARE NOT JUST ABOUT REPAIRS

02:26:58.342 --> 02:26:59.510
BUT ABOUT VICTIMS.

02:26:59.577 --> 02:27:01.312
AND THE UTILITY STABILITY IS NOT

02:27:01.379 --> 02:27:04.215
JUST ABOUT A UTILITIES IT'S

02:27:04.282 --> 02:27:07.151
ABOUT CALPERS CAL STIRS.

02:27:07.218 --> 02:27:09.187
OTHER TEACHERS WHO HAVE INVESTED

02:27:09.253 --> 02:27:11.022
IN THESE UTILITIES IT'S EACH ONE

02:27:11.088 --> 02:27:12.757
OF US WHO ACTUALLY HAVE TO

02:27:12.823 --> 02:27:14.125
PROTECT THE INVESTMENT OF SO

02:27:14.192 --> 02:27:15.993
MANY OF THOSE A CALIFORNIANS

02:27:16.060 --> 02:27:17.128
THAT HAVE.

02:27:17.195 --> 02:27:18.496
INVESTED IN UTILITIES AND

02:27:18.563 --> 02:27:19.463
WHETHER THAT IS THERE ARE

02:27:19.530 --> 02:27:20.731
ENVIRONMENTAL MEASURES OR

02:27:20.798 --> 02:27:22.366
WHETHER THAT IS OUR ACTUAL

02:27:22.433 --> 02:27:23.034
PAYCHECKS.

02:27:23.100 --> 02:27:24.702
THAT WE HAVE PUT BEHIND SOME OF

02:27:24.769 --> 02:27:27.505
THESE I UTILITIES WE OWE THEM.

02:27:27.572 --> 02:27:30.341
TO STAND FIRM DISTINTA CATHER.

02:27:30.408 --> 02:27:32.476
AND WITH THAT I I RESPECTFULLY

02:27:32.543 --> 02:27:33.678
ARREST REQUEST AN AYE VOTE AND I

02:27:33.744 --> 02:27:35.213

TIME WITH MY ASSEMBLY MEMBER

02:27:37.782 --> 02:27:38.249
COLLEAGUES AND MY CENTER

02:27:38.316 --> 02:27:39.150
COLLEAGUES ON THIS.

02:27:39.217 --> 02:27:40.651
ON THIS ISSUE AND I THINK YOU

02:27:40.718 --> 02:27:42.420
FOR YOUR BOLDNESS THIS IS NOT

02:27:42.486 --> 02:27:45.189
EASY BUT IT'S GOOD AND I ALSO

02:27:45.256 --> 02:27:45.790
WANT TO THINK THE GOVERNOR'S

02:27:45.856 --> 02:27:46.324
OFFICE.

02:27:46.390 --> 02:27:50.394
ON IT'S BEEN A ROCK STAR AND

02:27:50.461 --> 02:27:51.395
LISTENING TO ALL OF US IS NOT

02:27:51.462 --> 02:27:52.396
ALWAYS EASY THERE'S A LOT OF

02:27:52.463 --> 02:27:54.432
VOICES WE ARE A MIXED BAG OF

02:27:54.498 --> 02:27:57.201
NUTS -- TO SAY IT MILDLY.

02:27:57.268 --> 02:27:58.936
SO TO COME LIKE WE'VE ALL SAID

02:27:59.003 --> 02:28:00.838
TODAY TO HAVE SO MUCH SUPPORT I

02:28:00.905 --> 02:28:02.039
WANT TO THANK YOU FOR LISTENING

02:28:02.106 --> 02:28:03.241

02:28:03.307 --> 02:28:04.942
LISTENING TO THE VICTIMS.

02:28:05.009 --> 02:28:06.344
AND LIKE I SAID I RESPECTFULLY

02:28:06.410 --> 02:28:09.680

YOU AND I'D LIKE TO THINK OF

02:28:13.117 --> 02:28:14.752
THIS COMMITTEE.

02:28:14.819 --> 02:28:16.153
FOR A DIGGING INTO THIS ISSUE

02:28:16.220 --> 02:28:19.223
AND ALLOWING US TO PRESENT THIS

02:28:19.290 --> 02:28:21.092
BILL BEFORE YOU TODAY.

02:28:21.158 --> 02:28:25.429
AS WAS OUTLINED -- THIS IS BEEN

02:28:25.496 --> 02:28:27.131
SORT OF A CONTINUATION.

02:28:27.198 --> 02:28:30.534
OF A PROCESS OF TRYING TO ENGAGE

02:28:30.601 --> 02:28:31.836
IN A VERY DIFFICULT SET OF

02:28:31.902 --> 02:28:33.904
CIRCUMSTANCES WE STARTED LAST

02:28:33.971 --> 02:28:36.073
YEAR WITH UTILITIES.

02:28:36.140 --> 02:28:37.642
SHOWING UP BASICALLY.

02:28:37.708 --> 02:28:39.310
A SAYING HOW THEY FELT UNDER

02:28:39.377 --> 02:28:40.544
SIEGE.

02:28:40.611 --> 02:28:41.979
THE POTENTIAL IMPACT AND THE

02:28:42.046 --> 02:28:44.548
FOCUS WAS ON DOING SOMETHING TO

02:28:44.615 --> 02:28:47.151
REVERSE OR TO MODIFY INVERSE

02:28:47.218 --> 02:28:48.419
CONDEMNATION.

02:28:48.486 --> 02:28:50.187
WE WENT THROUGH A PROCESS TO

02:28:50.254 --> 02:28:51.789
NINE A ONE LED BY.

02:28:51.856 --> 02:28:53.958
A GERMAN DODD AND I THINK WE ALL

02:28:54.025 --> 02:28:56.093
UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE OTHER

02:28:56.160 --> 02:28:58.129
ISSUES THAT SURROUND THIS I

02:28:58.195 --> 02:28:59.697
THINK WE RECOGNIZE LAST YEAR

02:28:59.764 --> 02:29:01.165
THAT WE NEEDED TO MOVE VERY

02:29:01.232 --> 02:29:02.633
AGGRESSIVELY AND WE DID.

02:29:02.700 --> 02:29:04.969
THIS ISSUE HAS.

02:29:05.036 --> 02:29:05.770
BEEN HANDLED AND OR OR DRESSED

02:29:05.836 --> 02:29:07.038
IN A VERY.

02:29:07.104 --> 02:29:09.940
PROACTIVE WAY UNDER.

02:29:10.007 --> 02:29:10.741
THE PREVIOUS GOVERNOR.

02:29:10.808 --> 02:29:13.077
JERRY BROWN.

02:29:13.144 --> 02:29:13.778
BOB.

02:29:13.844 --> 02:29:16.314
BUT NOW AFTER CAMPFIRE AND AND A

02:29:16.380 --> 02:29:18.783
LARGE UTILITY A BANKRUPTCY.

02:29:18.849 --> 02:29:21.452
WE START.

02:29:21.519 --> 02:29:24.155
TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AND WE ALL

02:29:24.221 --> 02:29:25.790
DIDN'T OR HOPING THAT.

02:29:25.856 --> 02:29:27.024
SB NINE NO ONE WOULD CARE IS A

02:29:27.091 --> 02:29:28.926
LITTLE FURTHER.

02:29:28.993 --> 02:29:31.562
BUT HERE WE ARE.

02:29:31.629 --> 02:29:32.863
AND AS IT WAS POINTED OUT

02:29:32.930 --> 02:29:35.266
EARLIER.

02:29:35.333 --> 02:29:37.735
WHEN YOU HAVE A UTILITY GO INTO

02:29:37.802 --> 02:29:39.070
BANKRUPTCY?

02:29:39.136 --> 02:29:40.204
IT'S DRAGON VICTIMS RIGHT ALONG

02:29:40.271 --> 02:29:43.207
WITH IT.

02:29:43.274 --> 02:29:45.209
AND SO WE DO FEEL.

02:29:45.276 --> 02:29:47.211
OUR HEARTS BREAK.

02:29:47.278 --> 02:29:50.014
AND THE BREAKING AGAIN TODAY.

02:29:50.081 --> 02:29:52.583
WHEN VICTIMS ARE REMINDING US OF

02:29:52.650 --> 02:29:54.552
THEIR PERSONAL PAIN?

02:29:54.618 --> 02:29:55.619
AND THE CHALLENGES THAT THEY'RE

02:29:55.686 --> 02:29:59.256
DEALING WITH ON A DAILY BASIS.

02:29:59.323 --> 02:30:01.058
SO THIS IS A A STRUCTURED

02:30:01.125 --> 02:30:03.227
APPROACH.

02:30:03.294 --> 02:30:05.696
THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS STEPPED

02:30:05.763 --> 02:30:09.400
OUT ON IT HAS SHOWN LEADERSHIP.

02:30:09.467 --> 02:30:11.535
ESPECIALLY WHEN NO REAL OPTION

02:30:11.602 --> 02:30:13.337
WAS APPARENT THAT WAS GOING TO

02:30:13.404 --> 02:30:15.272
BE PERFECT THAT WOULD MAKE

02:30:15.339 --> 02:30:17.074
EVERYBODY FEEL GOOD.

02:30:17.141 --> 02:30:18.542
THAT SOMEONE WAS GOING TO WALK

02:30:18.609 --> 02:30:19.777
AWAY FROM THIS PART OF THE

02:30:19.844 --> 02:30:21.112
PROCESS AND FEEL LIKE.

02:30:21.178 --> 02:30:22.580
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY DID HERE SO

02:30:22.646 --> 02:30:24.048
YOU KNOW WHAT IT DIDN'T GO AS

02:30:24.115 --> 02:30:25.616
FAR AS WE NEEDED.

02:30:25.683 --> 02:30:26.884
TO YOU KNOW IT IT'S JUST NOT

02:30:26.951 --> 02:30:30.221
PERFECT ENOUGH [inaudible]

02:30:30.287 --> 02:30:32.123
I WAS.

02:30:32.189 --> 02:30:34.024
DRAGGING MY FEET AT FIRST.

02:30:34.091 --> 02:30:35.493
I WASN'T SURE THAT WE CAN REALLY

02:30:35.559 --> 02:30:37.795
GET THROUGH A PROCESS THAT WOULD

02:30:37.862 --> 02:30:39.296
BE TRANSPARENT.

02:30:39.363 --> 02:30:41.699
AND WOULD BE OPEN AND ENGAGING

02:30:41.766 --> 02:30:43.234
TO THE PUBLIC AND THEN BE ABLE

02:30:43.300 --> 02:30:44.902
TO HAVE SOMETHING.

02:30:44.969 --> 02:30:46.637
KEYED UP.

02:30:46.704 --> 02:30:48.139
NOT THERE YET BUT TEED UP. TO

02:30:48.205 --> 02:30:50.307
GET DONE.

02:30:50.374 --> 02:30:53.144
BY THE TWELFTH OF JULY

02:30:53.210 --> 02:30:53.444
[inaudible]

02:30:53.511 --> 02:30:58.015
BUT WE'RE ON PATH.

02:30:58.082 --> 02:31:00.418
AND I THINK THAT THERE'S YEAH

02:31:00.484 --> 02:31:02.119
BOTTOM LINE IS WE'RE TRYIG TO

02:31:02.186 --> 02:31:04.555
FIX A CALIFORNIA PROBLEM

02:31:04.622 --> 02:31:04.855
[inaudible]

02:31:04.922 --> 02:31:06.357
THESE UTILITIES.

02:31:06.424 --> 02:31:09.293
R. SO ENTER GO.

02:31:09.360 --> 02:31:10.261
TO THE OPERATION OF THE STATE

02:31:10.327 --> 02:31:12.029
AND OTHER BUSINESSES THAT ARE

02:31:12.096 --> 02:31:14.565
IMPACTED AS A RESULT OF IT.
