WELCOME. TO RCT INFORMATIONAL HEARING. WELCOME THE SECOND OF OUR INFORMATIONAL HEARINGS ON THE FUTURE OF CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION. IN CALIFORNIA'S K. TWELVE SCHOOLS. TODAY'S HEARING IS JOIN WE HOSTED BY FOR ASSEMBLY COMMITTEES. EDUCATION COMMITTEE OF WHICH I AM A CHAIR BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE ON EDUCATION FINANCE. CHAIR MCCARTY IS NOT HERE YET IF HE'S COMING BY.

LARGE KITCHEN SYSTEM HAS FOCUSED ON COLLEGE READINESS WERE ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT COLLEGE READINESS OR COLLEGE ENTRANCE. BUT THERE'S ALSO CLEAR NEED TO FOCUS ON CAREER READINESS AND CLEAR EXPLORATION BOTH TO MEET THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS BUT ALSO TO MEET WORKFORCE DEMANDS. THIS TOPIC BENEFIT STUDENTS FOR SURE BUT ALSO THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY WHICH HAS SO MANY JOBS TO GO WANTING. BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE STUDENTS WITH THAT TECHNICAL SKILL SET AND IN FACT FOR ABOUT THE LAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS WE HAVEN'T TRIED TO DEVELOP IT. AT THE K. TWELVE LEVEL BUT I'VE RECENTLY WE AWAKENED AND NOW THIS EFFORT IS TO KEEP THAT THAT THAT. RCT FUNDING ALIVE. SCHOOLS MUST REPAIR ALL STUDENTS FOR A WORLD BEYOND HIGH SCHOOL WHETHER THEY ARE. WHERE THEY CHOOSE TO GO TO A TWO OR FOUR YEAR COLLEGE? OR TRADE SCHOOL IF THEY CHOOSE TO GO DIRECTLY INTO THE WORKFORCE. THE CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION CENTER GRANTS HAVE NOT BEEN A KEY SOURCE OF SUPPORT FOR CT PROGRAMS. A RECENT YEARS BUT THESE FUNDS ARE SET TO EXPIRE THIS YEAR. CG PROGRAMS MUST CONTINUE TO BE A PRIORITY FOR OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM. AND AS A STATE WE NEED TO MAINTAIN AND BUILD ON THE INVESTMENTS HAVE ALREADY BEEN MADE IN THESE PROGRAMS AND IN OUR OUR SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITIES. AND I KNOW THERE MAY BE SOME OTHER A MEMBERS HERE WISH TO COMMENT QUICKLY QUICKLY PLEASE BUT JUST FOR ME OTHERS SAY WHY I'M HERE. AND I'M THAT'S NOT WHY I'M HERE TODAY THAT'S WHY I'M IN THE ASSEMBLY IT'S MY. MY EXPERIENCES TEACHERS WHEN I BRING HERE AND. I SAW MANY KIDS FALL OFF THE PATH OF HIGH SCHOOL SUCCESS BECAUSE THERE JUST WASN'T. SOMETHING OF A HIGH SCHOOL TO ENGAGE THEM. THEY WEREN'T GOING TO A FOUR YEAR UNIVERSITY THEY KNEW THAT THAT WAS NOT IN THEIR PLAN. YET WE DIDN'T ACCOMMODATE BARREL THERE I'M. THEIR GOALS AND I SEE THIS WE NEED TO OFFER MULTIPLE PATHS TO SUCCESS THE STATE FOR ALL OF OUR STUDENTS. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS EFFORT IS ABOUT.

WELCOME EVERYBODY FOR BEING HERE AND JUST REMIND PEOPLE THAT DOES THIS HAS BEEN A SERIES OF HEARINGS ON C. T. E. AND WE WERE A VERY EXCITED TO HOST MANY OF YOU IN OUR DISTRICT AND WHAT A PARK. WHERE WE HAVE A SAW FIRST HAND SOME OF THE? ACTUAL C. T. E. PROGRAMS THAT DOES THAT VICE SCHOOL WAS SHOWCASING THOSE INCLUDING ON AUTOMOTIVE PROGRAM AG PROGRAM CULINARY. AYE EVEN AYE MORE EXCITING ARTISTS THAT SEVERAL OF THOSE PROGRAMS FINAL RIGHT IN TWO OTHER COMMUNITY COLLEGE CYPRESS COMMUNITY COLLEGE WHERE THOSE AUTOMOTIVE STUDENTS THEN MOVE INTO THE CYPRESS COMMUNITY COLLEGE PROGRAM. AND ARE ACTUALLY RECRUITED RIGHT OUT OF THAT PROGRAM. WITH TOYOTA BEING ONE OF THEIR PARTNERS AND ARE DOING EXTREMELY WELL AS FAR AS NOT ONLY A SALARY BUT HAVING THE TRAINING WITH THE TECHNOLOGY. SO WE KNOW AS FAR AS. THE WORK FORCE ONE OF OUR MAIN FUNCTIONS. THAT WE ARE FOCUSING ON IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE DOING WHAT WE ARE DOING IN THE CT  <u><c.green>IS</c></u> IN DIRECT RELATION. UP TO THE JOB MARKET AND WHAT WE KNOW THAT OUR EMPLOYERS ARE ASKING FOR WHETHER IT'S FUTURE IN TECHNOLOGY WHETHER IT'S A WORK FORCE US SET OF SKILLS.

AND MISS BURKE HAS JOINED US TOO DID YOU WANT TO SAY ANYTHING QUICKLY AND ANY OF YOU. DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT OF A GREAT WITH US MOVE OUR FIRST PANEL BECAUSE THAT'S WHO WE'RE REALLY HERE TO HEAR FROM. ALL FIRST BRING UP ARE. NATASHA COLLINS FROM LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. DONNA Y. AT FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. AND AMBER ALEXANDER AND LISA BRZEZINSKI FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AND THERE IS AN ALLEY ó HAND OUT I BELIEVE IT'S IN YOUR PACKET. AND YOU MAY PROCEED WHEN READY THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON NATASHA COLLINS FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE I WE'VE BEEN ASKED TO PROVIDE A BROAD OVERVIEW OF HIGH SCHOOL CAREER TECHNICAL ON IT EDUCATION THAT'S GOING TO BUILD UPON THE OCTOBER SECOND HEARING. THAT YOU ALL PARTICIPATED IN. WE'RE GOING TO BE PROVIDING THAT OVERVIEW THEN WILL BE. PROVIDING AN OVERVIEW OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. AND OTHER CT PROPOSALS AS WELL SOME COMMENTS. AS THE CHAIR MENTIONED YOU'LL BE. MEETINGS WITH A HANDOUT THAT WE PROVIDED BEFOREHAND. ENTITLED OVERVIEW OF CREEK TECHNICAL EDUCATION. WILL START ON THE FIRST PAGE WHICH SHOWS THE FIFTEEN INDUSTRY SECTORS. BUT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION HAS DESIGNATED FOR CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION. HIGH SCHOOL'S REALLY ORGANIZE THEIR CT  <u><c.green>AROUND THESE</c></u> INDUSTRY AREAS WHICH RANGE FROM MANUFACTURING TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN ARTS AND MEDIA. WITHIN EACH INDUSTRY AREA THE CD EDUCATION HAS DEVELOPED MODEL CURRICULUM STANDARDS THAT HIGH SCHOOL PROGRAMS FOLLOW. AYE INS IN ORDER TO QUALIFY AS A HIGH QUALITY CTE PROGRAM. TURNING TO PAGE TWO. WE KNOW THAT IN OFFERING CT AT HIGH SCHOOLS THERE ARE. SEVERAL OBJECTIVES AND HERE ARE THE FOUR PRIMARY OBJECTIVES THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED. FIRST TO PROMOTE STUDENT ENGAGEMENT AND OFTENTIMES TO TEACH ACADEMIC SUBJECTS IN A HANDS ON WAY. SECOND TO TEACH TECHNICAL SKILLS TO STUDENTS. THIRD TO TEACH SOFT SKILLS SUCH AS COMMUNICATION AND TEAM BUILDING. AND FOURTH TO HELP MEET STATE WORK FORCE NEEDS THAT'S ONE OF THE STATE. WORKFORCE PLANS GOALS TO PROVIDE MORE MIDDLE SKILLED WORKERS IN CT AND HIGH SCHOOLS OFTENTIMES HAS AN OBJECTIVE TO DO THAT. MOVING TO PAGE THREE WE PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT THE STATE'S APPROACH TO FUNDING CT  <u><c.green>AT</c></u> HIGH SCHOOLS OVER TIME. PRIOR TO THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA THE STATE SUPPORTED CTE THROUGH VARIOUS CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS THOSE ARE EARMARKED PROGRAMS FOR SPECIFIC PURPOSES IN THIS CASE CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION. THE LARGEST OF THESE AIR MARK PROGRAMS WAS THE SAHARA CP ALSO KNOWN AS THE REGIONAL OCCUPATIONAL CENTERS AND PROGRAMS AT ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. WHEN THE STATE TRANSITION TO THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA AND TWENTY THIRTEEN FOURTEEN. CATEGORICAL PROGRAM FUNDING INCLUDING OUR OCP THAT FUNDING WAS LARGELY ELIMINATED AND ROLLED INTO THE NEW FORMULA. WHICH PROVIDED A NOTABLY HIGHER BASE RATE FOR HIGH SCHOOL PROGRAMS AND RECOGNITION OF THE HIGHER COSTS OF PROGRAMS LIKE CREW TECHNICAL EDUCATION AND. OTHER COLLEGE PREPAREDNESS PROGRAMS. WHILE THE ROC PEEPER GRIMACE ROLL THEN SEVERAL SMALLER CATEGORICAL CTT PROGRAMS FOR NOT THEY STAYED OUTSIDE OF THE LC A FIVE. THE STATE ORIGINALLY INTENDED TO PHASE EN EL CFF FUNDING OVER SEVERAL YEARS PIE AS STATE REVENUES INCREASED. WITH THE ORIGINAL PROJECTION OF MEETING FULL FUNDING AND TWENTY TWENTY. ONE TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THE STATE FUNDED SEVERAL TRANSITIONAL PROGRAMS DURING THIS TIME AS IT MOVED TOWARDS THAT FULL FUNDING. FIRST IN ADDITION TO ROLLING THE RCP FUNDS INTO THE NEW FORMULA. OF THOSE THAT WERE RECEIVING THOSE FUNDS WERE REQUIRED FOR TWO YEARS TO KEEP SPENDING THAT MONEY ON CT PROGRAMS IN THEIR DISTRICTS. AFTER THAT. THE STATE ADOPTED THE UMPS CCP TEETH THE CAREER PATHWAYS TRUST WHICH WAS FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OVER TWO YEARS AND THEN THE CT INCENTIVE GRANT WHICH I'M YOU HEARD ABOUT A BIT EARLIER. WHICH WAS A THREE YEAR NINE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDED FUNDING THROUGH TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN SO THIS CURRENT YEAR. THE SEATING INCENTIVE GRANTS AND DECREASE STATE FUNDING AS IT INCREASED A LOCAL MATCH REQUIREMENT AT THE SAME TIME. MOVING TO PAGE FOR YOU'LL SEE THE STATE'S APPROACH TO ACCOUNTABILITY UNDER THE LC FF FOUR CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION. CURRENTLY SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE REQUIRED TO DISCUSS WITH THEIR COMMUNITIES HOW THEY'LL ENGAGE STUDENTS IN A VARIETY OF AREAS. I INCLUDING A CAREER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION THEY DO THIS THROUGH THEIR LOCAL CONTROL AND ACCOUNTABILITY PANT PLAN WHICH IS A STATE REQUIRED STRATEGIC PLAN DISTRICTS ARE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT. TO INCENTIVIZE SCHOOLS TO SERVE STUDENTS IN THE BEST WAY POSSIBLE. AND ALSO TO SIGNAL TO THE STATE IF SCHOOLS NEED HELP. IMPROVING THE STATE REQUIRES DISTRICTS TO REPORT ON STUDENT OUTCOMES ON A NUMBER OF AREAS INCLUDING COLLEGE AND CAREER READINESS. THIS DATA IS DISPLAYED ON A PUBLIC WEDS WEBSITE KNOWN AS THE SCHOOL DASHBOARD. IF SCHOOLS DO NOT DO WELL ON DASHBOARD INDICATORS THEY WILL NEED TO ASSESS THE ROOT CAUSES OF THEIR PERFORMANCE ISSUES AND ACCESS SUPPORT TO IMPROVE. OUT COME DATA DISPLAYED ON SCHOOL DASHBOARD AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN I WAS THE FIRST YEAR THAT WE SAW THE COLLEGE AND CAREER READINESS INDICATOR. WHAT INDICATED WAS THAT FIFTY PERCENT? OF CALIFORNIA STUDENTS WERE DEEMED. I'M COLLEGE CAREER PREPARED. TWENTY FIVE WERE DEEMED NOT PREPARED AND TWENTY FIVE PERCENT ARE AND TWENTY FIVE PERCENT WERE DEEMED APPROACHING PREPARED. IF YOU LOOK ON PAGE FIVE OF YOUR HANDOUT YOU'LL SEE A FIGURE IN WHICH WE WALK THROUGH THE INDICATOR AND. THE DIFFERENT METRICS THAT ARE INVOLVED IN CALCULATING AT. YOU'LL SEE THE A PREPARED APPROACHING PREPARED ND NOT PREPARED ARE ON THIS GRAPHIC I WOULD NOTE THAT THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION HAS INDICATED THAT THEY INTEND TO ADD A WELL PREPARED. VINDICATOR. THAT WOULD INCLUDE MORE METRICS OF CT E. INCLUDING THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS THAT PARTICIPATED IN WORK BASED LEARNING. AND ACQUIRED CERTIFICATES. ON PAGE SIX. WE PROVIDE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE GOVERNOR'S TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN CT  <u><c.green>PROPOSAL.</c></u> ALTHOUGH THE ADMINISTRATION WILL PROVIDE GREATER DETAIL ON THIS PROPOSAL LEADER IN THIS PANEL. THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES TO ALLOW THE CT INCENTIVE GRANT TO SUNSET IN THE CURRENT YEAR. AND INSTEAD TO PROVIDE THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE WITH TWO HUNDRED AND TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS AN ONGOING FUNDING FOR HIGH SCHOOL CT <u><c.green>. THROUGH</c></u> THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAM. STRONG WORK FORCE IS A PROGRAM THAT FUNDS EIGHT REGIONAL CONSORTIA WHICH DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT PLANS. DESIGNED TO MEET THE REGIONAL WORKFORCE NEEDS. OF THE TWO HUNDRED TWELVE MILLION PROPOSED FOR THE HEIST FOR HIGH SCHOOL TO BECOME A PART OF THIS REGIONAL APPROACH TO CT TWO HUNDRED MILLION WOULD BE FOR DIRECT SERVICE SAYS. FOR CT AT HIGH SCHOOLS. REGION'S WOULD RECEIVE THE FUNDS BASED ON THEIR SHARE OF STATEWIDE ADA I KNOW I'M. INACCURACY IN OUR HAND OUT IT'S NOT JUST HIGH SCHOOL ABA IT'S SEVEN THROUGH TWELVE EIGHTY A. THAT WOULD BE ONE COMPONENT COMPONENT OF DETERMINING HOW MUCH REGION'S RECEIVE. ALSO BE DETERMINED BASED ON THE NUMBER OF JOB OPENINGS AND THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE. IN THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS REGION. FROM THERE AFTER WE DETERMINE THE THE FUNDING AMOUNT OF. FOR EACH OF THE REGIONS. OF THE CONSORTIA WOULD DETERMINE THROUGH A COMPETITIVE BASIS WHICH SCHOOL DISTRICTS WOULD RECEIVE THE MONEY IN ORDER TO OFFER. WORKFORCE ALIGNS CT. SCHOOL DISTRICTS WOULD ALSO BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A ONE TO TWO MATCH FOR THE FUNDING. I WOULD JUST EMPHASIZE THAT DISTRICTS COULD ONLY USE THEIR FUNDING FROM THIS PROGRAM TO OFFER CTE COURSES THAT ARE IN THE INDUSTRY AREAS THAT ARE ALIGNED WITH THEIR STRONG WORK FORCE REGIONAL PLANTS. THE REMAINING TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS WOULD BE FOR SEVENTY TWO PATHWAY COORDINATORS THAT WOULD WORK WITH SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO HELP THEM COURTNEY PROGRAMS WITH THEIR STRONG WORK FORCE PLANS. AS WELL AS PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO THOSE PROGRAMS. WHAT ALSO NOTE THAT THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES TO FULLY FUND THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA TWO YEARS AHEAD OF SCHEDULE? IN THE BUDGET YEAR THIS WOULD EQUATE TO A NINE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS AS A HIGH SCHOOL BAY STREET. WHICH IS ABOUT THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS MORE THAN THE PER PUPIL HIGH SCHOOL BASE ATE WHEN WE BEGAN ALL CFF AND TWENTY. ARE THIRTEEN FOURTEEN. ON PAGE SEVEN WE PROVIDE OUR ASSESSMENT OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. WE RAISE CONCERNS WITH THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO CREATE A CASE THROUGH TWELVE CT CATEGORICAL PROGRAM. DESPITE LC FF BEING FULLY FUNDED AND THE USE OF THE COLLEGE AND CAREER READINESS INDICATOR BEGINNING. I'M TWENTY SEVENTEEN. UNDER LC FF EVERY HIGH SCHOOL IS EXPECTED TO PROVIDE COLLEGE AND CAREER READINESS TO STUDENTS WE HAVE CONCERNS THAT MOVING BACK TO A CATEGORICAL APPROACH COULD BE A SIGNAL THAT CT IS VIEWED IN AT AS AN ADD ON TO THE HIGHEST COURT HIGH SCHOOL EXPERIENCE. RATHER THAN A PART OF IT. IN ADDITION WE HAVE CONCERNS OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL DEFINE CCT  <u><c.green>TOO NARROWLY. HIGH</c></u> SCHOOL CT HAS VARIOUS SCHOOLS IN ADDITION TO MEETING REGIONAL WORKFORCE NEEDS. LASTLY WE HAVE CONCERNS THAT THE PROPOSAL DOES NOT INCLUDE SEVERAL OF THE OTHER CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS THAT STILL EXIST OUTSIDE OF THE LC A FAST. WHEN COMPARED TO THE CT INCENTIVE GRANT WE THINK THE INCENTIVE GRANT APPROACH HAS A FEW ADVANTAGES OVER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. FIRST IT PROVIDES HIGH SCHOOLS WITH MORE FLEXIBILITY TO OFFER SITU  <u><c.green>AN INDUSTRY AREAS NOT</c></u> ONLY THOSE THAT ARE ALIGNED WITH THE REGIONAL WORKFORCE NEEDS. SECOND THE PROGRAM IS OVERSEEN BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WHICH HAS GREATER EXPERTISE IN CT CURRICULUM STANDARDS. AND HIGH SCHOOL CT OVERALL. PAGE EIGHT OF YOUR HANDOUT DESCRIBES AB SEVENTEEN FORTY THREE. WHICH PROPOSES TO EXTEND THE CT INCENTIVE GRANT FOR THREE ADDITIONAL YEARS AN INCREASE FUNDING. SPECIFICALLY IT WOULDN'T IT WOULD PROVIDE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY TO SCHOOLS TO PREFER TO PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY CT  <u><c.green>AND</c></u> REQUIRE A ONE TO ONE MATCH. THE FUNDING WOULD BE INTENDED AS TRANSITIONAL FUNDING TO FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF ALL CFF AND THE FINAL DEVELOPMENT AT THE COLLEGE AND CAREER READINESS INDICATOR. THE BILL ALSO ALSO ESTABLISHES PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS THAT WOULD REQUIRE PROGRAMS TO BE DEEMED SUCCESSFUL BY THE CD RECEIVE FUNDING. AT SEVERAL OTHER REQUIREMENTS SUCH AS PROVIDING OPPORTUNITIES TO STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES AND TO STUDENT CT ORGANIZATIONS. PAGE NINE OUTLINES OUR RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE LEGISLATURE WITH REGARD TO MOVING FORWARD TO CT. WE BELIEVE THERE ARE MANY BENEFITS TO THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA APPROACH. THE FORMULA IS FULLY FUNDED IN THE BUDGET YEAR WE'VE HAD FIVE YEARS OF TRANSITIONAL FUNDING. AND WE HAVE OF ITS COLLEGE AND CAREER READINESS INDICATOR. FOR THIS REASON WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE TAKE THE LCF APPROACH WE BELIEVE THAT IF IF THE LEGISLATURE HAS CONCERNS INSTEAD OF CREATING A CATEGORICAL PROGRAM. IT CAN A ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS IN OTHER WAYS FOR EXAMPLE IF THE CONCERN IS THAT NOT ENOUGH FUNDING IS PROVIDED TO HIGH SCHOOLS OFFER CT THE LEGISLATURE CAN REVISIT THE HIGH SCHOOL FUNDING AMOUNT. IF THE CONCERN IS THAT THERE'S NOT STRONG ENOUGH INCENTIVES THROUGH THE ACCOUNTABILITY. THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE COULD REVISIT ACCOUNTABILITY AND WE HAVE SOME IDEAS TO SHERIFF IF THAT ISN'T INTEREST. OF ON THE COMMITTEES. HOWEVER IF THE LEGISLATURE DOES WISH TO TAKE THE CATEGORICAL APPROACH TO CUT TO CT <u><c.green>. WE</c></u> RECOMMEND TAKING THE CT INCENTIVE GRANT APPROACH WITH SOME MODIFICATIONS THAT BRING IN. SOME OF THE COORDINATION THAT THE GOVERNOR SUGGESTS. SPECIFICALLY. A WE BELIEVE THAT A LINING A PORTION OF THE CT FUNDING TO WORKFORCE NEEDS BUT NOT ALL OF IT COULD HELP WITH ALIGNMENT BETWEEN COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AND K. TWELVE CT PROGRAMS. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT REQUIRING THE CD  <u><c.green>AND THE COMMUNITY</c></u> COLLEGES TO SHARE DATA ACCOUNTABILITY. COULD STRENGTHEN COORDINATION FOR EXAMPLE BY REQUIRING QUE TWELVE AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO LINK DATA SUCH THAT WE COULD SEE ONE A STUDENT LEAVES HIGH SCHOOL IF THEY ENTER CT PROGRAM IF THEY'RE REMEDIATED AND HOW WELL THEY PERFORM AFTER THAT STAGE. TO FURTHER COORDINATE WE RECOMMEND ROLLING IN THE OUTSTANDING CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS THAT ARE STILL OUTSIDE OF THE LC FF IN TO ANY NEW CATEGORICAL PROGRAM TO REDUCE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN AND PROVIDE MORE STREAMLINED APPROACH. SO THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN REVISIT IN FUTURE YEARS TO SEE IF THIS PROGRAM IS MEETING ITS GOALS WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER MAKING THE PROGRAM LIMITED TERM AND SETTING VERY CLEAR DATA. EXPECTATIONS AS WELL AS TARGETS FOR SCHOOLS. IN THAT WAY THE LEGISLATURE COULD COME BACK IN SEVERAL YEARS AND EVALUATE WHETHER IT'S MEETING THE GOALS THAT WERE PUT FORTH. FOR FUNDING THE PROGRAM WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO CONSIDER THE TRADEOFFS OF HOW MUCH FUNDING TO PROVIDE. FUNDING THAT GOES TOWARDS A CATEGORICAL PROGRAM IS FUNDING THAT MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR OTHER PRIORITIES OR FOR THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER SETTING THE AMOUNT AT A RATE THAT SIGNALS. SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT THIS PROGRAM IS SUPPLEMENTAL TO THE LCF AFTER THEIR SPENDING ON CT SOURCE FOR CT. I WITH THAT I'M OF CONCLUDE MY COMMENTS I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. GREAT THANK YOU LET'S HEAR FROM OUR MYSTARA Y. IT FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT EDUCATION WILL FINISH THE PANEL. THAT WILL HAVE QUESTIONS. GOOD AFTERNOON DONNA Y. IT DIRECTOR OF THE CAREER IN COLLEGE TRANSITION DIVISION AT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. YOU CAN SPEAK TO YOU TODAY ABOUT SOME OF THE OUTCOMES THAT WE'RE SEEING UNDER THE SEA TAG INCENTIVE GRANT. AND THEN ALSO THE DIRECTION OF K. THROUGH TWELVE CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION. MUCH OF THE INFORMATION THAT I'M GONNA PRESENT TODAY WAS ACTUALLY PUT TOGETHER BY THE SEVEN SEAT TAKE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CENTERS AND MANY OF THE LEADERS ARE BEHIND ME TODAY. THE LIST OF AWARDEES OF THE CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION INCENTIVE GRANT WERE SEATED WILL BE PUBLISHED DURING THE MARCH STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION MEETING. THE THIRD AND FINAL ROUND OF C. TAKES ON A TOTAL OF THREE HUNDRED NINETY THREE GRANT APPLICATIONS WITH THIRTEEN OF THOSE BEING NEW APPLICANTS. AND THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY BEING GRANT RENEWALS. DURING THE GRANT PERIOD OF TWENTY FIFTEEN TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE REQUEST FOR FUNDS TOTALED JUST UNDER NINE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE MILLION. ENROLLMENT NUMBERS FOR CT PROGRAMS UNDER THE THREE YEARS OF SEE TAKE HAS INCREASED TWELVE PERCENT. CT ENROLLMENT HAS INCREASED OVER TWENTY TWO PERCENT SINCE TWENTY ELEVEN TWELVE. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN FIFTY FIVE PERCENT OF HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WERE ENROLLED IN CT PROGRAMS WITH INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY BENEFACTIONRING. ENGINEERING HOSPITALITY TOURISM AND PUBLIC SERVICES SHOWING THE LARGEST GROWTH DURING SEATED. UNDERSEA TAKE SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CREATE AN EXPANSIVE TV PROGRAMS DRIVEN BY STUDENT INTEREST CURRENT REGIONAL AND STATEWIDE LABOR MARKET DATA. INDUSTRY ADVOCACY AND IN ALIGNMENT WITH PROGRAMS OFFERED AT THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS. K. THROUGH TWELVE CT  <u><c.green>IS</c></u> UNIQUE FROM C. T. PROGRAMS OFFERED IN COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN FOUR KEY WAYS. FIRST THE EMPHASIZE THE INTEGRATION OF GENERAL EDUCATION CONTENT AND CURRICULUM WITH CTE CONTENT AND CURRICULUM. COURSES ARE BASED ON THE CT MODEL CURRICULUM STANDARDS WHICH WERE ADOPTED BY THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION AND TWENTY THIRTEEN. STUDENT LEADERSHIP THROUGH CAREER TECHNICAL STUDENT ORGANIZATIONS ARE INTEGRAL TO STUDENT SEATS TWO CT STUDENT OUTCOMES. AND STUDENTS ARE PROVIDED WITH THE CONTINUUM OF WORK BASED LEARNING EXPERIENCES THROUGH THEIR CT COURSE SEQUENCES. OUR EARLY DATA SHOWS US THAT THE MAJORITY OF SEATED FUNDS WERE USED FOR THESE VERY PURPOSES. SEE TAKE FUNDS WERE USED TO BRING K. THROUGH TWELVE CT PROGRAMS UP TO CURRENT INDUSTRY STANDARDS AND EQUIPMENT WITH CAPITAL OUTLAY DOLLARS BEING USED FOR STATE OF THE ART EQUIPMENT LIKE ULTRASOUND MACHINES. FOR VETERINARIAN ANIMAL HUSBANDRY ATTIC AG ED PROGRAMS. AMBULANCE SIMULATORS FOR EMERGENCY MEDICINE AND HEALTH SCIENCE PROGRAMS. AND LASER CUTTERS FOR MEDI FACTORING PROGRAMS TO NAME JUST A FEW. FOR MOST PROGRAMS THIS WAS THE FIRST SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN INDUSTRY STANDARD EQUIPMENT SINCE THE RECESSION IN CATEGORICAL FLECKS OF A WAIT THROUGH TEN. DISTRICTS ALSO REPORTED THAT SEATED FUNDS WERE SPENT ON CT DEVELOPMENT AS WELL AS WELL AS COLLEGE INCORRECT COUNSELORS. PERHAPS THE MOST EXCITING ACHIEVEMENT OF SEE TAKE IS THAT THE MAJORITY OF DISTRICTS REPORTED TO US THAT CT UNIT IS NOW EMBEDDED IN THEIR EL CAP. AND THEIR DISTRICTS HAVE A RENEWED INTEREST AND COMMITMENT TO CT. THE REPORT THAT THE CALIFORNIA CAREER PATHWAYS TRUST SEE TEGAN AND NOW THE COLLEGE CAREER INDICATOR HAVE BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN THIS CHANGE. WELL GRANT RECIPIENTS PARTICIPATED IN SEATED REPORTED THAT THEIR DISTRICTS WERE COMMITTED TO HIGH QUALITY CT. THEY DID EXPRESS CONCERN ABOUT THEIR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN INDUSTRY STANDARD EQUIPMENT. AND CONTINUING DEDICATED CT PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT WITHOUT SEATED DOLLARS. WE SEE TAKE THE CD ESTABLISH SEVEN COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION AS REGIONAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDERS. THE SEVEN CENTERS WERE CHOSEN FOR THEIR LEADERSHIP AND EXPERTISE IN THE DELIVERY OF K. THROUGH TWELVE CT. THE SEVEN CENTERS PROVIDED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT BASED ON THE UNIQUE REGIONAL AND STATE WHITE NEEDS OF K. THROUGH TWELVE CT. INCLUDING THE MODEL CURRICULUM STANDARDS. INTEGRATION OF GENERAL ED COURSES AND CT CONTENT. PROJECT BASED LEARNING FUND COLLEGE AND CAREER PATHWAY DEVELOPMENT AS DEFINED IN THE STATE PLANS FOR BOTH PERKINS AND ESTA. IN ADDITION TO THE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROVIDED BY THESE COUNTY TEE A CENTERS THE CAREER IN COLLEGE TRANSITION DIVISION AT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. HAS PROVIDED ADDITIONAL SUPPORT BY DEDICATING FOUR DIVISION STAFF AS REGIONAL SUPPORT TO OUR CITY LEADERS IN THE FIELD. WHO HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF PERKINS GRANT MANAGEMENT? THE DIVISION ALSO PROVIDES PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND MENTORING. FOR UP TO UP AND COMING CTE LEADERS THROUGH OUR CT LEADERSHIP INSTITUTE. DIVISION STAFF HAS COLLABORATED WITH OUR CD COLLEAGUES IN THE EDUCATIONAL DIVERT DATA AND MANAGEMENT DIVISION TO PROVIDE STATEWIDE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT ON UPGRADES TO CAL PADS THE CALIFORNIA LONGITUDINAL PEOPLE DATA SYSTEM. WE ARE ALSO WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH STAFF FROM THE ANALYSIS MEASUREMENT AND ACCOUNTABILITY DIVISION. ON THE EXPANSION OF CAREER INDICATORS FOR THE STATEWIDE COLLEGE CAREER INDICATOR. AND MOST FREQUENTLY WE'VE BEEN COLLABORATING WITH CD COLLEAGUES IN FACILITIES AND TRANSPORTATION TO SUPPORT SCHOOL DISTRICTS THROUGH THE NEW CTE FACILITIES PROGRAM APPLICATION. LISTENING TO BEING RESPONSIVE TO AND PRIORITIZING THE NEEDS OF THE WEEK THOSE WE SERVE IS THE NUMBER ONE PRIORITY. A CAREER IN COLLEGE TRANSITION DIVISION AT THE CD. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND BEYOND WERE PRIORITIZING CT MIDDLE SCHOOL EXPANSION THROUGH A PILOT GRANT PROGRAM FOR TEN MIDDLE SCHOOL CTE PROGRAMS. THAT ALIGN TO OUR CALIFORNIA PARTNERSHIP ACADEMIES WERE CURRENTLY WORKING ON A THREE TO FIVE YEAR PLAN FOR EXPANSION OF MIDDLE SCHOOL CT. AND WE EXPECT TO PUBLISH THE ANNOUNCEMENT FOR THOSE GRANTS IN MID MARCH. AN EARLY RESPONSE FROM THE FIELD IS VERY VERY ENCOURAGING. AS OF TWENTY THIRTEEN THERE WERE OVER FOUR HUNDRED CALIFORNIA PARTNERSHIP ACADEMIES IN THE STATE. CPA MODEL HAS OVER THIRTY YEARS OF PROVEN SUCCESS WITH CPA STUDENTS OUTPERFORMING NON CPA STUDENTS. IN GRADUATION RATES YOU SEE A THROUGH G. RATES HIGHER GPA HIGHER INTEREST LEVEL WAGES AND HIGHER COLLEGE GOING RATES. CPA'S FOCUS ON THE INTEGRATION OF GENERAL EDUCATION IN CT CONTENT WITH WITHIN SPECIFIC INDUSTRY SECTORS. AND THEY PROVIDE A SERIES OF WORK BASED LEARNING EXPERIENCES THAT ALLOW STUDENTS TO TRY ON CAREERS THROUGH THEIR INTERACTION WITH INDUSTRY PROFESSIONALS. CPA STUDENTS ARE ALSO SUPPORTED BY A COHORT. OF TEACHERS AND COUNSELORS DEDICATED TO THEIR SUCCESS. PRE APPRENTICESHIP IS ANOTHER HIGH PRIORITY AND UNDER THE DIRECTION OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION TOM TWELVE X. AND. DIVISION STAFF HAS MET WITH LEADING LABOR UNION OFFICIALS IN THE STATE AS WELL AS STATE LEADERS IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY. TO DEVELOP A PLAN FOR THE EXPANSION OF PRE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS TO ADDRESS THE DEMAND FOR SKILLED LABOR IN OUR STATE. CURRENTLY THERE ARE EIGHT PRE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS OPERATING UNDER THE CPA MODEL. AND WE PLAN TO EXPAND THOSE WITH THE SUPPORT OF OUR LABOR AND INDUSTRY PROFESSIONALS. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE PATHWAYS ADVISORY COMMITTEE. WAS CONVENE TWO BIG BEGIN ADDRESSING THE REQUIREMENT FOR A NEW STATE CT  <u><c.green>PLAN PENDING</c></u> THE AUTHORIZATION OF PERKINS. THIS ADVISORY COMMITTEE IS COMPOSED OF MEMBERS OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE DEPARTMENT STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION AND THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE BOARD OF GOVERNORS. IN ADDITION TO THIS ADVISORY COMMITTEE STAFF FROM THE CURRENT COLLEGE TRANSITION DIVISION AT THE CD <u><c.green>. AND STAFF FROM THE</c></u> WORK FORCE IN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OFFICE AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. CONTINUE TO WORK. SORRY. ONE PAGE. IN DEFINING THE ELEMENTS OF HIGH QUALITY COLLEGE AND CAREER PATHWAYS INCLUDING WORK BASED LEARNING CAREER READINESS APTITUDES. EARLY COLLEGE OPORTUNIDADES AND STUDENT SUPPORT. ON A REGIONAL LEVEL SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE CONTINUE THE GOOD WORK THAT STARTED UNDER THE CALIFORNIA CAREER PATH WE STRESSED. THEY CONTINUED TO CREATE BRIDGES ACROSS THE TWO SYSTEMS. TO CREATE DUAL ENROLLMENT AND ARTICULATION AGREEMENTS AND THE ALIGNMENT OF COLLEGE AND CAREER PATHWAYS ACROSS K. THROUGH TWELVE AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE. IN CONCLUSION WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STATEWIDE COLLEGE CAREER INDICATOR THERE IS AN PRESIDENTE DEMAND FOR K. THROUGH TWELVE CT PROGRAMS. WHILE THIS IS EXCITING IT'S ALSO DAUNTING AND OUR CHALLENGE IS TO ENSURE THAT CTT PROGRAMS MEET THE STANDARDS OF HIGH QUALITY CT. AND ENSURE THAT ALL K. THROUGH TWELVE CT PROGRAMS ALLOW OUR STUDENTS TO EXPLORE THEIR CAREER INTERESTS. AND TO PREPARE FOR BOTH ENTRY LEVEL EMPLOYMENT AS WELL AS POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION AND TRAINING. CHOICE SHOULD BE UP TO OUR STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES. OUR JOB IS TO ENSURE THAT STUDENTS LEAVE OUR SCHOOLS PREPARE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE FULL RANGE OF CAREER IN POST SECONDARY OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO THEM. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION AND FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF K. THROUGH TWELVE CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION. THANK YOU MISS WHITE. OF I JUST DO WANNA GO THE PRESIDENT'S ASSEMBLY MEMBER CERVANTES MORE SUCI. BAKER HAS JOINED SPEAKERS JOIN US MR MCCARTY. AND MISTER BERMAN'S JOIN US AS WELL I DON'T THINK I'VE BEEN DOING ANY FROM INFORMATIONAL HEARING IN THIS CAPITAL EVER. WHERE THERE'S BEEN THIS? MANY MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY SO I THINK THAT SHOWS THE INTEREST IN THIS EFFORT SO. I THINK WE'RE IN A GOOD SPOT. WITH THAT WITH THAT WE'RE GONNA HEAR FROM. MISS AMBER ALEXANDER AND LISA BUCZYNSKI FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND I APOLOGIZE IF I DID NOT SAY THAT LAST NAME CORRECTLY YOU CAN CORRECT ME. WHEN YOU ARE UP. THAT AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AMBER ALEXANDER WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. BUILDING OFF THE LA OWES HIGH LEVEL SUMMARY OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL I'M GONNA TAKE MY TIME TO DOUBLE WILL BUT DEEPER INTO SOME OF THE SPECIFIC. ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL TO ESTABLISH A K. TWELVE SPECIFIC COMPONENT WITHIN THE STRONG WORKFORCE PROGRAM. THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL IS BUILT TO ENSURE THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS TO EXPLORE AND SELECT PATHWAYS INTO MIDDLE SCHOOL CAREERS CONTINUE AFTER THE END OF THE CT INCENTIVE GRANT. AS A REMINDER THE CT INCENTIVE GRANT WAS DESIGNED AS A SHORT TERM TRANSITION PROGRAM TO HELP DISTRICTS COVER THE COSTS OF CT WHAT THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA OR ELSE YET THAT WAS BEING FACED AND. THE LC FF BASED GRANT AMOUNT INCLUDES A TWO POINT SIX PERCENT ADJUSTMENT FOR GRADES NINE THROUGH TWELVE. WHICH IS INTENDED TO ACCOUNT FOR THE HIGHER COST OF PROVIDING CTE PROGRAMS AT THE HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL. ASSUMING FULL IMPLEMENTATION AND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THIS SPACECRAFT ADJUSTMENT WILL AMOUNT TO APPROXIMATELY FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION AN ONGOING FUNDING. THAT HAS BEEN BUILT INTO THE LC FF FACE THE CAN BE USED TO SUPPORT ROBUST CT PROGRAMS TO THE EXTENT THAT THOSE PROGRAMS ARE LOCAL PRIORITY. WELL THE ADMINISTRATION STILL CONTENDS THAT FUNDING ALLOCATED THROUGH THE LC FF SHOULD PAY FOR A FULL RANGE OF EDUCATIONAL COSTS INCLUDING CT. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES TWO HUNDRED MILLION ONGOING PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDING. TO PROVIDE AN EXTRA INCENTIVE FOR LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES TO OFFER HIGH QUALITY CD PROGRAMS THAT ARE ALIGNED WITH NEEDED INDUSTRY SKILLS AND REGIONAL WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS OCCURRING THROUGH THE EXISTING STRONG WORKFORCE PROGRAM. UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE THAT THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES WILL ALLOCATE FUNDING TO BE EIGHT EXISTING STRONG REGIONAL STRONG WORKFORCE REGIONAL CONSORTIA. BASED ON A FORMULA THAT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE REGION'S UNEMPLOYMENT RATE PROJECTED JOB OPENINGS AND SEVEN THROUGH TWELVE AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE. EACH REGIONAL CONSORTIA WILL THEN ADMINISTER A COMPETITIVE GRANT PROCESS TO DISTRIBUTE THEIR PORTION OF THE FUNDING TO ELIGIBLE LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES AND THEIR REGION. GRANT DETERMINATIONS WILL BE MADE BY SUBCOMMITTEE FORM BY THE CONSORTIUM MADE OF OF MADE UP OF INDIVIDUALS WITH EXPERTISE INCAPABLE OF EDUCATION AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. THIS SUBCOMMITTEE WILL WORK IN CONSULTATION WITH THE CONSORTIUM TO DECIDE THE SPECIFIC FUNDING AMOUNTS FOR EACH GRANT AWARD. SIMILAR TO THE C. T. INCENTIVE GRANT PROGRAM THE FUNDING ALLOCATED TO EACH CONSORTIUM WILL BE SEPARATED INTO THREE POTS FOR SMALL MEDIUM AND LARGE APPLICANTS. BASED ON THE AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE. IN ORDER TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR FUNDING APPLICANTS MUST BE A MEMBER OF THE CONSORTIUM AND BE PARTICIPATING IN THE REGIONAL WORKFORCE EFFORTS TO ALIGN WORKFORCE EMPLOYMENT AND EDUCATION SERVICES. BE UTILIZING THEIR REGION'S PLAN TO INFORM THEIR EFFORTS TO IMPLEMENT OR EXPAND UPON CTE PROGRAMS. PROVIDE A LOCAL MATCH FOR ANY FUNDING RECEIVED. FROM THE PROGRAM. AND MEET CERTAIN MINIMUM ELIGIBILITY STANDARDS THE MAJORITY OF WHICH WERE LIFTED FROM THE EXISTING CITY INCENTIVE GRANT PROGRAM APARTMENTS. SO WHY HAS THE ADMINISTRATION STRUCTURE THE PROPOSAL THIS WAY RATHER THAN CONTINUING TO PROVIDE FUNDING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO ADMINISTER QUE TWELVE SPECIFIC CD PROGRAM. LIKE YOU WE'VE BEEN LISTENING TO FEEDBACK AND COMMENTS MADE AT THE VARIOUS HEARINGS OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS. AND WE'VE HEARD SEVERAL COMMENTS BEING CONSISTENTLY MADE. FIRST WE HEARD THAT THE APPROACH I'VE PROVIDING ONE TIME OR LIMITED TERM GRANTS TO SUPPORT CITY IT'S NOT SUSTAINABLE. ADMINISTRATOR SAID THAT THEY'VE STRUGGLE TO PLANS ET PROGRAMMES FOR SHORT TERM GRANT OPPORTUNITIES LIKE THAT CT INCENTIVE GRANT AND THE CAREER PATHWAYS TRUST PROGRAM. IN RESPONSE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ESTABLISHES AN ONGOING AND SUSTAINABLE FUNDING STREAM FOR REGIONALLY A LINE TO SEE T. PROGRAMS. SECONDLY WE AGREE WITH THOSE WHO HAVE STAYED AT THAT WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT IS A REGIONAL ISSUE. COMMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE ABOUT INVESTING AS A STATE IN A REGIONAL MODEL TO SUPPORT CT. A MODEL THAT WILL BRING INDUSTRY AND THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY TO THE TABLE TO CONFORM EDUCATION. WE HEARD CONCERNS THAT DESPITE PAST EFFORTS TO INTEGRATE QUE TWELVE CT PROGRAMS WITH INDUSTRY AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE COURSE OFFERINGS. PROGRAMS ARE ALWAYS FEEDING SEAMLESSLY TO GET TOGETHER. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL SEEKS TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE BY UTILIZING A REGIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE THAT RT EXISTS UNDER THE STRONG WORK FIRST PROGRAM. THIS STRUCTURE IS PREDICATED ON THE NOTION THAT CALIFORNIA'S LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES COMMUNITY COLLEGES UNIVERSITIES WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD'S AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND INDUSTRY LEADERS SHOULD COLLABORATE TO INFORM. VETS OFFERINGS OF CTE COURSES AND PROGRAMS IN THEIR REGION. THE STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAM HAS EXPANDED THE AVAILABILITY OF REGIONALLY ALIGNED CT PROGRAMS AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE LEVEL. AND WE BELIEVE THAT THESE BENEFITS WILL ONLY BE FURTHER ENHANCED BY EXTENDING THE PIPELINE OF THIS PROGRAM INTO THE K. TWELVE COMMUNITY. INDUSTRY HAS CONSISTENTLY BEEN BRINGING UP THE NEED TO OFFER RELEVANT CT PROGRAM THAT WILL ACTUALLY PREPARE STUDENTS FOR CAREER POINT GRADUATION. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL IS INTENTIONALLY FOCUSED ON PROVIDING INCENTIVES FOR THOSE LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES. THAT ARE OFFERING C. T. PROGRAMS THAT ARE ALIGNED TO INDUSTRY NEEDS IN OUR REGION. AS A RESULT WE BELIEVE THAT THESE PROGRAMS WILL BETTER PREPARE STUDENTS TO MEET INDUSTRY WORKFORCE NEEDS. FINALLY WE'VE HEARD CALLS FOR THE STATE TO PUT IN PLACE ORIGINAL LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE TO ASSIST TEACHERS IN INDUSTRY PARTNERS IN IMPLEMENTING HIGH QUALITY CTE PROGRAMS. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL DOES THIS BY PROVIDING TWELVE MILLION AND ONGOING PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDING. TO PUT IN PLACE SEVENTY TWO K. TWELVE WORKFORCE PATHWAY COORDINATORS. WHOSE DUTIES WOULD INCLUDE PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT TO LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES IN IMPLEMENTING OR EXPANDING UPON THEIR LINE C. T. PROGRAMS. THIS WOULD ALSO INCLUDE CULTIVATING COLLABORATION BETWEEN LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES AND INDUSTRY TO FURTHER STRENGTHEN INDUSTRY INVOLVEMENT AT THE K. TWELVE LEVEL. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL HAS BEEN CAREFULLY CRAFTED TO PRESERVE KEY ELEMENTS OF THE SI TIENES INFOPRINT PROGRAM. CONTINUING TO FOCUS ON HIGH QUALITY CT PROGRAMS AND RETAINING THE LOCAL MATCH REQUIREMENT. TO ENSURE THAT FUNDING PROVIDED FOR THE PROGRAM IS BEING GRANTED TO ELEAZAR ARE ALSO COMMITTED TO INVESTING THEIR OWN VOCAL RESOURCES INTO THEIR PROGRAMS. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL INCLUDES THE SAME OUTCOME REPORTING METRICS THAT WERE PART OF THE CITY INCENTIVE GRANT PROGRAM. PERVERT DATA WILL BE RECORDED FOR THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES LAUNCH FOR DATA SYSTEM. WHICH HAVE THE CAPABILITIES TO SHOW HOW STUDENTS PROGRESS FOR EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS AND INTO THE WORKFORCE. BY FOCUSING ON INDUSTRY DRIVEN WORKFORCE ALIGNED CTE PROGRAM. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL PUTS IN PLACE A STRONG CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION FRAMEWORK. THAT ENSURES THAT REGIONAL WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PLANNING EFFORTS TRANSCEND ACROSS K. TWELVE AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES ULTIMATELY GUIDING STUDENTS DOWN A PATHWAY THAT CAN ACTUALLY LEAD THEM INTO A LIVABLE WAGE JOB. I HAVE WITH ME LISA RISEN SKI FROM ALSO FROM DEPARTMENT FINANCE AND WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. GREAT THANK YOU THANK YOU TO OUR FIRST PANEL HAVE QUESTIONS NOW FOR OUR FIRST PANEL I HAVE A FEW ALL KIND OF A QUICK SCAN BECAUSE IT DOES OTHER QUESTIONS. AND THERE ARE OTHER PANELS AFTER THIS. OFFER THE LA SHOW IF YOU WILL. YOU YOU HAD YOU MADE THE POINT THAT. HIGH SCHOOL CT OR EVEN MIDDLE SCHOOL HIGH SCHOOL CT HAS GOALS BEYOND WORKFORCE PREPARATION COULD YOU EXPAND ON THAT A BIT. SURE. SO ABA I BELIEVE THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION MENTIONS. THE FACT THAT MANY HIGH SCHOOLS UCT  <u><c.green>AS A WAY TO TEACH</c></u> ACADEMIC SUBJECTS SO WE'VE SEEN MORE AND MORE CTE COURSES QUALIFYING FOR. A MEETING A THREE G. REQUIREMENTS FOR EXAMPLE. CTE COURSES CAN BE USED TO TEACH ACADEMIC CONTENT IN A HANDS ON WAY. I'M. IN ADDITION TO TO THE TECHNICAL SKILLS THAT YOU MENTIONED CT IS OFTEN ARE USED AS A STUDENT ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY AS WELL ON TO KEEP STUDENTS ENGAGED IN HIGH SCHOOL. IN OF PROVIDING THEM OF COURSE WORK IN AN AREA THAT THEY HAVE INTEREST IN PROVIDING THEM WITH. A AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLORE DIFFERENT FROM TYPES OF CAREER. PADS THAT THEY MIGHT TAKE IN THE FUTURE. BUT WE'VE ALSO HEARD THAT CT  <u><c.green>AND AND OUR</c></u> RESEARCH REALLY INDICATES THAT SEAT YOU CAN TEACH STUDENTS SOFT SKILLS. SUCH AS. TEAM WORK. COMMUNICATION. SHOWING SHOWING UP ON TIME. BUILDING RESUMES. THAT PROVIDING SOME OF THOSE SOFT SKILLS THAT WE KNOW THAT EMPLOYERS AND AND. EVEN IF STUDENTS ARE GOING TO FOR UNIVERSITIES. REALLY BENEFITS THEM. GREAT THANK YOU. DUMB AND I AGREED THAT THESE PROGRAMS ENGAGE STUDENTS AGREE THEY HAVE ACADEMIC CROSSOVER. S. KNIGHTED REALLY UNDERSTATEMENT FRACTIONS LED TO OUR CONSTRUCTION AND USE A MEASURING TAPE RIGHT HAD A REALLY LEARN WHAT. THE DIFFERENCE THREE IN FIVE MASON SEVENTY SECOND PLAN THE CLASSROOM. BUT TO PLAN THE REAL WORLD IS MUCH DIFFERENT THAT'S WHAT I THINK CT. OF PROGRAMS DAVID YOU SHE YOU KNOW ME OFF YOUR CONCERN MIND YOU YOU CAN YOU CAN RESPOND TO. MY CONCERN IS THAT WE MIGHT START TRACKING STUDENTS IN SEVENTH GRADE. RIGHT THIS SOME OF THE GERMAN MODEL RIGHT WE STARTED SEVENTH GRADE YOU PICK YOUR LANE. ARE YOU CAN YOU SEE T.. ARE YOU GONNA GO TO UNIVERSITY AND I I I WANT STUDENTS TO PREPARE FOR BOTH FOR SURE. BUT I ALSO WANT THEM TO HAVE OPTIONS FOR BOTH AND NOT TO LOCK THEMSELVES AND FOR THE REST OF LIFE IN SEVENTH GRADE HIS IRA MY WORLD IS A SEVENTH GRADER. WASN'T TOO BROAD RIGHT I'M COULD YOU COMMENT ON THAT. I THINK THAT THE STATE AND THE LEGISLATURE HAVE HAD CONCERNS WITH TRACKING STUDENTS AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS THAT THE STATE HAS MOVED TOWARDS MORE OF. THE MODEL I I THINK WE ARE WE CALL IT MANY TIMES CAREER PATHWAYS ARE LINKED LEARNING MODEL WHERE STUDENTS ARE ABLE TO. WHAT THE GOAL IS REALLY BEEN FOR STUDENTS TO BE COLLEGE AND CAREER READY WHERE THEY WOULD HAVE AN OPTION TO ATTEND A FOUR UNIVERSITY OR? JOIN THE WORKFORCE OR ENROLL IN A TRAINING PROGRAM AFTER HIGH SCHOOL. FOR THAT VERY REASON WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT CERTAIN TYPES OF STUDENTS AREN'T. NUDGED AND INTO CERTAIN. CERTAIN PATHWAYS TRACKING ESSENTIALLY AS HAS BEEN AT BENNETT CONCERN AND I THINK THAT. THE THE STEPS THROUGH THE LC FF AND THE COLLEGE IN CORRECTING A SYNDICATE WAS AN ATTEMPT TO. ADDRESS THAT GREAT THANK YOU NEXT QUESTIONS FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT THE GOVERNOR SEEN THE NEED. FOR MORE CT FUNDING WITH TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ON AN ONGOING BASIS. NOT JUST SAYING A FOR THREE YEARS WERE GONNA DO THIS AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO GIVE UP ON IT SO I THINK THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT. THOUGH ONE MAJOR CHALLENGE I HAVE WITH THIS PROPOSAL YOU PROBABLY KNOWS THE CONSORTIUM. THAT TO ME IS LIKE THE SOVIET BLOCK I DON'T KNOW HOW PEOPLE ARE GONNA GET THEIR MONEY. ON HOW THEY'RE GONNA GET IT FAIRLY. IT'S HANDED OVER TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. WHICH IS VERY POOR PRECEDENT MY MIND THAT WE WOULD GIVE THEM THE AND I DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY. TO DO THIS. Y. WOULDN'T WOULDN'T KEEP THIS IN THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION I'M STILL CURIOUS. AND THERE ARE CHALLENGES THE DEPARTMENT EDUCATIONAL LET'S ADDRESS THOSE LET'S ADDRESS THOSE. BUT AGAIN WE HANDED OVER THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND THEN THEY HAND IT DOWN THE LOCAL CONSORTIUM. MY CONCERN IS ALSO THE LOCAL CONSORTIUM LEVEL IT'S HANDED DOWN OF THE CONSORTIA THINK ON AN EIGHTY A BASIS BUT IT'S NOT HANDED OUT BY THE CONSORTIUM ON AN EIGHTY BASIS IF I'M CORRECT. SO CAN YOU EXPLAIN HOW THAT IS SUPPOSED TO WORK AND HOW IT'S GOING TO BE FAIR THAT. DISTRICTS WON'T GET OUT VOTED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL ETCETERA. I'M. THERE WAS A LOT IN YOUR IN YOUR QUESTION FALL TRYING IF IF I MISSED ANYTHING GO FREE BECAUSE SHE WAS A GUY I GUESS YOU. SO THE APPROACH TO PROVIDE FUNDING TO ADD THAT THECOMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE THERE REALLY ALLOCATING THE FUNDING DOWN TO THE CONSORTIUM BASED ON A CALCULATED FORMULA. SO IT WOULDN'T NECESSARILY MATTER IF THE DEPARTMENT EDUCATION WITH CALCULATING THAT FORMULA OR WHETHER THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE WITH CALCULATING THAT FORMULA. THE FORMULA WILL BE WHAT IT IS AND BASED ON THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE RATE IN THE REGION THE PROJECTED JOB OPENINGS AND SEVEN FOR TWELVE EIGHTY A. UP AT THE CONSORTIUM LEVEL IS REALLY WHERE THE DECISIONS ON HOW WITHOUT FUNDING IT'S GETTING DISPERSED TO THE ALLEY AIDS THAT THAT'S REALLY WHERE IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS DOWN AT THE CONSORTIUM LEVEL. AND CURRENTLY I AM IN IT CONSORTIUM ARE ARE WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH OUR INDUSTRY PARTNERS IN THEIR REGION TO MAKE SURE THAT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE OFFERINGS IN THEIR AREA ARE LYING TO INDUSTRY NEEDS. AND WE ANTICIPATE THAT THAT AT COOPERATION WILL CONTINUE AS THE FUNDING FOR THIS PROGRAM GETS ALLOCATED. REALLY WITH THE INTENTION OF MAKING SURE THAT THE K. TWELVE PROGRAMS THAT ARE BEING FUNDED THROUGH THAT'S HAVE FOR THROUGH THAT'S PROPOSAL. ARE FINE OUR MEETING INDUSTRY NEEDS AND THAT AREA AND ARE DRIVEN BY WORKFORCE DEMAND IN THAT AREA. SO. IT AT THAT SUBCOMMITTEE IS IS ONE OF THE COMPONENTS THAT WE'VE ESTABLISHED TO REALLY TRY AND HELP MITIGATE SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT COMMUNITY COLLEGES WOULD BE MAKING THESE DECISIONS. ON BEHALF OF THE K. TWELVE IN THEIR AREA. THIS SUB COMMITTEE IS MADE UP OF A HAM IT UP OF EXPERTS WITH THE K. TWELVE EXPERTISE AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT IN THEIR IN THEIR AREAS SO. WE ARE WORKING WITH THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE NOW I'M IN IN GETTING SOME CALL SET UP WITH SOME OF THE REGIONAL CONSORTIA TO FIGURE OUT. HOW BEST TO INTEGRATE QUE TWELVE INTO THAT PROCESS WITHOUT DISRUPTING THE CURRENT STRUCTURE? BUT REALLY OUR GOAL IS THAT THESE PROGRAMS WILL BE MADE DOWN AT THE LOCAL LEVEL LEVEL WHERE I'M REGIONAL WORKFORCE DEMANDS ARE MOST KNOWN TO INDUSTRY IN THAT AREA. AND REALLY GETTING THEM TO INFORM THE K. TWELVE OCT OFFERINGS GREAT SO FROM A DISTRICT AND I'VE GOT NINE OTHER DISTRICTS MY CONSORTIA. AND ONE OF THEM VERY LARGE IT MIGHT IT BE THAT I WOULD GET OUT VOTED I WOULDN'T GET ANY THAT MONEY THAT WE DO HAVE THE LANGUAGE AND IN THE TRAILER BILL THAT. IT ESTABLISHES. THEY BASICALLY POP FIGHTERS SO THERE'S SOME SATISFIED WITH EACH WITHIN EACH CONSORTIA ALLOCATION FOR SMALL TO MEDIUM AND LARGER. AND SPECIFICALLY TO ADDRESS THAT CONCERN THAT THE SMOKE WOULD MAYBE BE SQUEEZED OUT BY SOME OF THE LARGE LAW SCHOOL DISTRICT A SMALL SCHOOL A IT'S BASED ON EIGHTY EIGHT SO IF YOUR PLANE OUTSIDE A AS A JPA. IT'S YOU KNOW YOU'RE COMBINED ABA IF YOU'RE PLAYING AS A SINGLE SCHOOL DISTRICT FURNITURE YOUR DISTRICT'S ADA. IT'S HOT IT'S BY EIGHTY OF THE DISTRICT NOT YET SCHOOL SITE NOW. BECAUSE YOU'RE PLAYING OUT THE SCHOOL DISTRICT OR COUNTY OFFICE OR WORK CHARTER SCHOOL ORDERED. JPA OKAY I STILL HAVE REAL I HAVE SIGNIFICANT I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE DESIGNED A SYSTEM BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO GO TO THE PARTNER DUCATION THAT'S WHAT'S IT STRIKES ME AS BECAUSE YOU'RE SAYING WHAT. WE WANT TO GIVE IT TO THE VICTIM NICOLE GE'S. BECAUSE THEY'RE ALIGNED WITH THE WITH THE LOCAL OF I'M JUST A LITTLE CONFUSED ON WHY YOU JUST WOULDN'T KEEP IT. IN THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION CAN ELABORATE ON THE CHURCH SO. I THINK WE GET TO GET AWAY FROM THE MINDSET BUT IT'S ACTUALLY THE THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE MAKING DECISIONS BECAUSE REALLY THEY'RE PASSING THE FUNDING DOWN TO THE REGIONAL CONSORTIUM LEVEL. THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT INVOLVED IN THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS ONCE IT GETS DOWN TO THAT CONSORTIUM LEVEL. IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION IS CAPABLE OF MAKING THAT CALCULATION. IT'S REALLY BASED ON THE FACT THAT THIS IS AN EXISTING STRUCTURE THAT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE HAS IN PLACE. TWO OF THE THREE FACTORS THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE AND BE I AM. THE PROTECTIVE JOB OPENINGS IN THE REGION OUR CALCULATIONS THAT ARE ALREADY IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE FORMULA SO THAT THE DEPARTMENT EDUCATIONAL JUST BE PROVIDING THE EIGHTY A. AND ULTIMATELY OUR GOAL WAS TO GET THE FUNDING DOWN TO THE CONSORTIUM AND THE MOST EFFICIENT MANNER. AND WE FELT LIKE PROVIDING IT DIRECTLY TO THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE WHO ARE A HOUSE THAT STRUCTURE IN PLACE AS MOST EFFICIENT. OKAY AND I JUST AGAIN I THINK WE NEED TO THINK BROADER THAN JUST WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT WE NEED THINK ABOUT HUMAN DEVELOPMENT HERE TOO. AND IT MIGHT BE. THAT A STUDENT IS AN A MIDDLE SCHOOL HIGH SCHOOL AND THEY HAVE A PATHWAY PROGRAM THAT MIGHT NOT BE AT THE LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE MIGHT BE SOMEWHERE ELSE THEY WANT TO GO. AND IT STILL MIGHT BE A FIT FOR THAT LOCAL SCHOOL BUT THEY MIGHT NOT GO TO THEIR VERY LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGES I HOPE YOU THINK ABOUT THAT TOO BUT I DON'T GET TOO FAR INTO THAT. TODAY BECAUSE I KNOW OTHERS HAVE QUESTIONS HERE BUT I'M REAL CONCERNED ABOUT. HOW THIS MONEY GETS DOWN ON THE GROUND IN THE ACCOUNTABILITY THE GROUND I'D VERY SOMETHING LIKE A NAVIGATOR MODEL IN THE GOVERNOR'S TWELVE MILLION AND THERE? THAT THEN. MY HOPE WILL BE THE NAVIGATORS OF THE AROUND THE STATE NOT LOCATED IN SACRAMENTO SO THAT THEY WOULD ACT YOU KNOW WE CUT INTO REGIONS AND THEY WOULD ACT AS THE LOCAL EXPERTS. ON HOW BEST TO CONNECT DISTRICTS TO TO TELL TO LOCAL JOB NEEDS REGIONAL JOB NEEDS. AGAIN NOT RELYING ON ON ON TO PEOPLE SITTING IN AN OFFICE IN SACRAMENTO BUT TAKE THAT TWELVE MILLION SPREAD ACROSS THE STATE REGION'S. AND AND THEY WOULD DO THE SAME THING THAT THIS WHOLE CONSORTIA THING WITH TO SOME A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT. SEEMS A LONG WAY LEAD TO MAKE. OKAY AND I KNOW MR MCCARTY HAD A COUPLE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU FIRST OF ALL IT'S GREAT TO SEE THE AT THE BROAD INTEREST FOR COMMITTEES. ROUGHLY MAYBE TWENTY. FIVE PERCENT OF THE ASSEMBLY I THINK IS PARTICIPATING IN THIS SHOWS HOW BIG OF AN INTEREST THAT WE HAVE IN THIS. AND I KNOW WE'RE GONNA GET IN GREAT DETAIL ON THE BUDGET COMMITTEE SO I WANT. I WANT TO BORE YOU BUT HERE ARE THE DETAILS BUT JUST KIND THE BIG PICTURE. BUT CERTAINLY WE'RE BOUND THE BUBBLE LAST FEW YEARS AS FAR AS FUNDING FOR THIS THROUGHOUT THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA THE ONE TIME MONEY FOUR HUNDRED THE THREE INCH THAN TWO HUNDRED SO. IT'S A RELIEF THAT WE HAVE AN ONGOING AMOUNT NOW GRANTED THAT THE DOLLAR AMOUNT THAT COULD BE DEBATED. I DO HAVE A GREAT CONCERNS WITH THE LA O. PROPOSAL AS FAR AS HAVING THE DISTRICTS WITH THEIR INCREASED ELSE IF THAT MONEY PICK AND CHOOSE THIS BECAUSE THEY HAVE SO MANY OTHER PRIORITIES. THEY HAVE THEIR PENSION COSTS ARE STIRS COST. TEACHER SALARIES YOU KNOW BASICALLY GET GETTING OR FROM THE GREAT RECESSION SELF. I DON'T THINK THIS WILL NECESSARILY BE A PRIORITY WHAT YOU WANTED TO BE LESS WE SAY THIS IS GOING TO BE A PRIORITY WHICH IS WHY I THINK. IT'S IPORTANT EVERITT WE'RE DOING HERE TODAY SO I THINK THAT THERE'S THERE'S TWO QUESTIONS AS FAR IT'S REALLY IT'S HOW MUCH MONEY ARE GOING TO PUT IN THE POT AND THEN HOW WILL IT BE. DOLED OUT ACROSS LEON ACROSS THE TO CALIFORNIA SO THE DOLLAR AMOUNT IT'S A GOOD START AT TWO HUNDRED TWELVE ON GOING. I THINK HIS DESIRE TO GO NORTH OF THERE AND CERTAINLY WILL POP WILL PROBABLY PUSH THAT IN IN OUR. BUDGET PROCESS IN THE ASSEMBLY. AYE I AM I'M IN LINE WITH THAT MISTER O'DONNELL AS FAR AS THE. MEANT IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS I'M NOT QUITE CERTAIN AS FAR AS WHY WE'RE PICKING THIS MODEL VERSUS THE PAST THREE YEARS. BUT ANOTHER ISSUE THAT I WANT TO RAISE WHICH HASN'T BEEN BROUGHT UP YET. IS THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A THOUSAND TYPE HIGH SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT. AND SOME KIDS AND PARENTS THERE THEY CAN VOTE WITH THEIR FEET THEY CAN GO ACROSS THE DISTRICT ACROSS THE TOWN. BUT SOMETIMES MAYBE THAT'S YOUR SCHOOL YOU YOU HAVE NO OTHER CHOICE MAYBE YOUR HONOR. THAT A RURAL AREA MAYBE URBAN AREA AND YOU'RE GONNA GO THAT SCHOOL BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE YOUR PARENTS OR WHOEVER WANT WANT YOU TO FOCUS AND. YOU CAN BE ON A LOT BECAUSE THE CONSORTIA AT MAY NOT HAVE YOUR HIGH SCHOOL PARTICIPATING SO. IN THE OLD MODEL WHERE IS A CATEGORICAL YOU KNOW EVERY STUDENT HAD AN OPPORTUNITY AND TO PARTICIPATE. IN OUR AYE RIGHT DIDN'T BUY METAL SUBCLASS ROWS OF HIGH SCHOOL. AND SO IT'S DIFFERENT NOW WE WANT TO PICK THE THE THE PROGRAM WHICH THINK MAKES THE MOST SENSE BUT HOW CAN WE ENSURE THAT BASED UPON WHAT. MISTER O'DONNELL SAID THEY DID NOT JUST THE ECONOMIC NEEDS FOR THE INDUSTRY BUT THAT. HUMAN NEEDS FOR IT A KID WHO WANTS TO. BE ABLE TO TO TO MAKE A GO OF THIS HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT VARIABLE TO. PARTICIPATE IN THEY WON'T GET LEFT BEHIND. I'VE SURVEYED EXISTING STRONG WORKFORCE REGIONAL CONSORTIA BOTH COVER THE ENTIRE STATE SO EVERY LA A WILL FALL WITHIN ONE CONSORTIA SNOW LA A WILL BE LEFT OUT. THE EXTENT TO WHICH THAT ALLEVIATE USES TO ENGAGE IN THAT CONSORTIUM THAT IS THAT IF ULTIMATELY UP TO THEM. YOU'D NEED AT THIS PROVIDES AN INCENTIVE FOR HOPE WE'RE HOPING TO GET THEM FURTHER INVOLVED WE KNOW CURRENTLY ELOISE ARE INVOLVED IN THESE CONSORTIUM FOR NOT JUST COMMUNITY COLLEGE CONSORTIUM. RIGHT NOW. SOME ELEAZAR ARE ARE PARTICIPATING IN SOME ARE I'M EVEN RECEIVING FUNDING THROUGH THE EXISTING STRONG WORK FIRST PROGRAM UP THROUGH THE POT THAT'S RESERVE FOR REGIONALLY PRIORITIZE PROJECTS. WE ACTUALLY THINK THAT THIS APPROACH WILL LATIN BEAT. FURTHER COOPERATION AT THE LOCAL LEVEL SO IF THERE IS A PROGRAM THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY OFFERED AT YOUR PARTICULAR SCHOOL. WE THINK THAT THESE WILL LEAD TO CONVERSATIONS FOR DISTRICTS AND. OTHER ELEAZER IN THE REGION ARE TALKING AND AREN'T COLLABORATING ON MAKING SURE THAT COURSES ARE OFFERED TO STUDENTS IN THEIR AREA WE THINK IT WILL LEAD TO FURTHER COOPERATION BETWEEN ELOISE AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES FOR THINGS THAT. YOU POSSIBLY FOR AND USE THE FACILITIES TO THE EXTENT THAT IT DISTRICT DOESN'T HAVE FACILITIES AVAILABLE TO OFFER CERTAIN CLASS. SO WE DO THINK. THAT THIS PROPOSAL ACTUALLY EXPAND ACCESS RATHER THAN RESTRICTING. SO I'M NOT QUITE SURE HOW THAT WOULD WORK IF YOU'RE INDIVIDUAL STUDENTS. IN THE INTERIM DO YOU DO YOU HAVE TO TRANSFER TO A DIFFERENT SCHOOL HARD YOU HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL. YOUR AREA GETS TOGETHER AND COMES TO YOU AS. IT WILL BE FOR YEARS AND YOU'RE LEFT OUT. AT GENERATIONS LOST. SO IF YOU'RE AN INDIVIDUAL STUDENT NOW AND AND THERE'S A COURSE THAT YOU'RE INTERESTED IN THAT'S NOT BEING OFFERED. YOU KNOW WE DO HAVE THE THOUGH SO I'LL CAP PROCESS WHERE YOU CAN KIND OF BRING THOSE CONCERNS THROUGH THAT PROCESS AND IF YOU GET ENOUGH SUPPORT LOCALLY MAYBE THAT IS THE CLASS THAT WILL ULTIMATELY BE OFFERED ON YOUR CAMPUS. IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE THAT THAT STUDENT IS AWARE OF OTHER OPPORTUNITIES IN THEIR AREA THAT'S ONE OF THE DUTIES OF THAT. QUE TWELVE FOR FOURTH PATHWAY COORDINATORS THAT WE'RE CREATING IN THE REGION THAT WE THE REASON THAT WE'VE CREATED SEVENTY TWO IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE ACCESSIBLE TO ELEAZAR AND TO INDIVIDUAL SCHOOLS AND TO STUDENTS WITHIN THOSE SCHOOLS. AND MAKING SURE THAT THAT SCHOOLS AND STUDENTS KNOW OF AVAILABLE PROGRAMS IN THEIR REGION AND REALLY MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE FULLY AWARE OF OTHER OPPORTUNITIES OUT. OUR GREATNESS WILL GO TO. MISTER GIPSON. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN. THE CHAIRMAN'S ALREADY ASKED ME TO BE NICE I WOULD IT BE NICE WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT. JOB. LET ME SIMPLY STRONGLY SUGGESTS THAT. I REPRESENT A SIX PORTS DIGICAMS THAT CALIFORNIA. THE PEOPLE I REPRESENT CAN'T WAIT. CAN'T WAIT WE HAVE TO GET IT RIGHT THE FIRST TIME. AND SO I'M VERY CONCERNED AS AN ALLY MY COMMENTS WITH MY COLLEAGUES. AHMED ALREADY ARTICULATED. WE HAVE TO GET IT RIGHT THE FIRST TIME LIKE RIGHT NOW AND PUTTING MONEY INTO. THIS PROGRAM. FOR DISTRICTS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT OR NOT. IS TROUBLING TO ME. I WAS TROUBLING TO ME IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW THIS IS A GREAT PROGRAM AND. AGAIN PEOPLE. CHOOSE NOT TO GO TO HIGH SCHOOL I MEAN NOT GO TO OF A FOUR YEAR COLLEGE OR A JUNIOR COLLEGE. THEY WANT A JOB AFTER I FINISH HIGH SCHOOL AND THEY HAVE TO HAVE TECHNICAL SKILLS IN ORDER TO. SUSTAIN THEMSELVES. AS IN ADULTS. FATHER BOYLE OF HOMEBOY BAKER SAID GIVE A MAN A JOB STOP A BULLET. THAT'S REAL IN MY COMMUNITY WHICH I REPRESENT. I CAN SEE THE DECREASE BY GIVING INDIVIDUAL A JOB TECHNICAL SKILLS THAT THEY CAN GET A JOB. TO THIS THAT CAN SUSTAIN THEMSELVES THROUGH LIFE. AND SO YOU KNOW I THINK THERE'S A GREAT. INTEREST BY MY COLLEAGUES BEING HERE IN THE ROOM BEING FULL. ON TO SHOW THAT WE NEED TO HAVE SOMETHING WHERE IS NOT BEING APPROPRIATE EVERY SO OFTEN. AND WHY NOT HAVE SOMETHING THAT'S. ACROSS THE ENTIRE STATE A CALIFORNIAN EDUCATION. KATE THROUGH TWELVE WHERE CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION YEAR OVER THE TIME WHEN YOU MAY BE TOO YOUNG BUT I REMEMBER THE TIME WHEN I WAS GOING TO SCHOOL. I HAD OFFERED IN JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL THE WITH THE SHOPS. AND THEN IT CARRIED ON TO HIGH SCHOOL. AND A NUMBER OF MY CLASSMATES OPEN UP THEIR OWN AUTUMN ACCOUNT SHOPS. THEY WANTED TO PLUMBING. THEY WENT TO JOBS RIGHT NOW THAT'S PROVIDING A WAY OF LIFE FOR THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES. AND THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT THOSE THAT THINK THAT WE NEED TO TRY TO CONTINUE TO DO RIGHT NOW WITH EMERGING TECHNOLOGY. HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND SO MY QUESTION IS WE TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW FOLLOWING THE MONEY HOW DO WE FOLLOW THE FUNDS. DOES. TO ENSURE EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION INCLUDING DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WOULD YOU DESCRIBE TO US MCCARTY IS QUESTION I HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT. SO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL REALLY DOES TAKE A A REGIONAL APPROACH SO ULTIMATELY THAT COUNT ABILITY IS GOING TO BE COMING FROM THE REGIONAL CONSORTIUM. AND MAKING SURE THAT THAT REGIONAL CONSORTIUM IS GETTING THE OUTCOMES THAT THAT THEY WERE HOPING TO ACHIEVE AND MAKING THE INVESTMENT SIMPLY BASED ON OPPORTUNITY SYSTEM AS YOU DESCRIBED. AS IT IS HERE THAT SYSTEM YOU DESCRIBE. SOME CAN AND SOME WON'T BASED ON YOU KNOW SCHOOL DISTRICT NEEDS AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE. THAT WE CAN'T COMPILE DISTRICTS TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROGRAM JUST LIKE WE DID NOT REQUIRE THEM TO PARTICIPATE IN THE CT INCENTIVE GRANT PROGRAM. WE WE MAKE OPPORTUNITY AVAILABLE AND ULTIMATELY THAT DISTRICT IS THE ONE MAKING THE DECISION ON WHETHER OR NOT TO APPLY. TO TO UNDER OUR PROGRAMMER INTERCITY INCENTIVE GRANT PROGRAMS OF A SCHOOL I'M SORRY IF A SCHOOL DISTRICT SIGH I WANT EVERYBODY TO GO TO COLLEGE AND I'M NOT GOING TO OFFER. THE CT PROGRAM BUT YOU KNOW YOU HAVE KIDS THERE WHO ARE NOT GOING TO GO TO COLLEGE. WHETHER IT'S A COMMUNITY COLLEGE OR A FOUR YEAR COLLEGE SORT HAVES THOSE KIDS. ARE THEY IMPORTANT AS WELL. WE CERTAINLY ARE IN OUR ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM DOES HAVE% THE COLLEGE CAREER INDICATOR IN PLACE AND I THINK REALLY BAD. THAT IS OUR WAY OF COMPELLING DISTRICTS TO YOU KNOW BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR OFFERING THESE TYPES OF COURSES. BUT BUT I CAN'T ULTIMATELY FOR NOT REQUIRING THEM TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY ONE PARTICULAR CT PROGRAM THAT WERE OFFERING WE DO HOPE THAT THEY SEE THE VALUE IN DOING THAT IN DIDN'T. WE EXPECT THAT IN INVESTING THESE PROGRAMS THEY WILL SEEK YOU KNOW INCREASE STUDENT OUTCOMES IN THE AREA PUPIL ACHIEVEMENT AND SCHOOL CLIMATE. BUT BUT AGAIN THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WERE COMPELLING THEM TO DEAL. I'LL STOP THERE. THANK YOU ARE MISTER FRAZIER WHOM SELF COMES FROM THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY AND KNOWS THIS ISSUE WELL. SO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I WANT TO JUST KIND OF. CAPITALIZE ON WHAT YOU WOULD TALK ABOUT FRACTIONS IN IN REAL LIFE. I HAD HUNDREDS OF THE PREMISES COME OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL WHO ARE NOT QUALIFIED. TO EVEN START. WORKING FOR ME BASED ON. OF NOT HAVING THE ABILITY TO GO THROUGH THE THE SEEDIER OCCASIONALLY THAT I HAD. OF I DID HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO THE COLLEGE I WENT INTO AN APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM RIGHT AFTER BECAUSE I KNEW I HAD AN APTITUDE. TO GO AND BE A SOMEWHAT COMPETENT. GOING FORWARD LOT OF KIDS COMMIT HIGH SCHOOL TO GO INTO THE WORKFORCE THEY DON'T HAVE THIS TRAINING. AND THEY'RE EMBARRASSED BECAUSE. THEY DON'T THEY CAN'T BE HELPFUL AND THERE ARE A BURDEN TO THE EMPLOYER AND TO GIVE UP. THEY ABSOLUTELY DO GIVE UP. AND SO THEN THEY KIND OF FLOUNDERED AROUND LOOKING FOR A PLACE. AND I THINK THAT THE CHAIRS IS DEMONSTRATED THAT. WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO GIVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY THIS TO THESE IN YOUNG INDIVIDUALS. AND THEY BECOME. INFATUATED OR. IMPRESSED OF WHAT THEY CAN ACCOMPLISH EARLY IN LIFE AND KNOW THAT THEY CAN BE SUCCESSFUL AT SOMETHING. ARM. WE ALL WE KNOW IT WILL IDENTIFY WITH LIFE SKILLS FOR THE SPECIAL NEEDS POPULATION EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY TWO YEAR OLDS WE GIVE THEM EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN. WE HAVE HELL GRANTS WE HAVE CASH FOR COLLEGE WE HAVE ALL OF THESE THINGS. FOR THE PATHWAY TO COLLEGE. BUT YOU TELL US THAT YOU. AND YOU KNOW MAYBE THREE MORE YEARS IT WE'RE GONNA LOOK AT THIS WHAT WAS FLAT FUNDED PER CD. IT'S IMPERATIVE. THAT WE LOOK AT. HA THIS AS A. OPPORTUNITY FOR YOUNG PEOPLE. ON I AM I WILL TELL YOU THAT. AS AN EMPLOYER. I THINK THAT WHEN THE INDIVIDUALS CAME TO ME AND THEY WERE PREPARED. THAT. I FAILED THEM IN SOME WAY. PAYING TAXES THAT THEY WEREN'T GETTING. THE EDUCATION THAT THEY NEEDED TO BE SUCCESSFUL. AND SO I IMPLORE ALL OF YOU. TO MAKE A CONSCIOUS EFFORT TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE CHILDREN HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY. AND DID JUST LIKE I SAID I CAN'T THANK THE CHAIR FOR BRINGING THIS UP AND AND BEING A. CO AUTHOR WITH HIM ON HIS BILL BECAUSE I IF WE DON'T STEP UP AND WE LET THE DISTRICTS DETERMINE OUTCOMES. THEY'RE GONNA CIRCUMVENT THE PROCESS BECAUSE THEY HAVE A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE. AND I THINK THAT IT NEEDS TO BE A MANDATE. IN THE STATE I THINK YOU SAID YOU CAN'T. MAKE AT DISTRICT OF. COMPLY TO ANY KIND OF CT WE CAN. AND WE SHOULD. AND SO I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE CHAIR GOING FORWARD. PHONE THAT PROCESS BECAUSE. I BECAME AN APPRENTICE BECAUSE OF CT OR VOCATIONAL ED. AND THEN I BECAME A MASTER CARPENTER ANY CONTRACTOR AND NOW I'M A STATE LEGISLATOR. AND I AM GOING TO CONTINUE CHECKING THE CT UNTIL THE DAY THAT I'M NOT A. SO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH ALL OF YOU AND I THINK WE SHOULD START TRACKING PERFORMANCE METRICS ON WHAT IS ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH CD HAND JOB RETENTION BECAUSE OF IT. THANK YOU LANCASTER FRAZIER HER PASSION. NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM ON THIS QUIRK SILVA AND THEN DOCTOR WEBER AFTER. WELL I I APPRECIATE GETTING BOTH PROPOSALS AS AS YOU MIGHT SAY AND I KNOW THAT THERE'S A LOT OF WORK PUT INTO THESE BY A. THE MAJOR CONCERN IS AS WE LOOK AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES ON THE ONE MODEL OF THE OF THE MOVING THE MONEY DOWN TO A CONSORTIUM. AND THEN THE CONSORTIUM A IN MANY CASES MAKING THE RECOMMENDATIONS AND THEN THE FORMULA BEING A EIGHTY A STRONG WORKFORCE PROGRAM. PROJECTED JOBS AND JOB GROWTH I FEEL LIKE. IT NO MATTER WHICH DISTRICT YOU REPRESENT AND AGAIN I REPRESENT ORANGE COUNTY SO MUCH DIFFERENT THAN THE INLAND. EMPIRE THAT WE DON'T WANT HAVE WINNERS AND LOSERS IN THIS WHICH MEANS THAT YOU KNOW IF WE DO. AS MR GIPSON SAYS THEY SAY IT WOULD REALLY FOCUS ON DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND THAT WOULD MEAN IN MANY WAYS MY DISTRICT WOULDN'T HAVE ANY OPPORTUNITY TO GET FUNDING. I ALSO THINK THAT A IF YOU LEAVE IT UP TO INDIVIDUAL US SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO EITHER SEEK OUT THE FUNDING APPLY FOR THE GRANTS. OR OF BE INTERESTED IN THE SOME WILL AND SOME WON'T SO YOU'RE GONNA ALSO HAVE THAT. THAT OPPORTUNITY UP MAY BE TAKEN BECAUSE THE DISTRICT SAYS THIS IS NOT IMPORTANT TO US OR WE DON'T HAVE THE FUNDS FOR IT OR WE CAN'T COMPETE WITH THE GRANT SO THAT AGAIN SOME DISTRICTS HAVE MANY MORE TOOLS. THAN OTHERS WHETHER THEY HAVE A HIRED A GRANT WRITER WHETHER THEY YEAH YEAH AND THESE ARE ALL LITTLE NUANCES BUT WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO FUNDING SOMEBODY HAS MORE AN ADVANTAGE BECAUSE THEY HAVE A FULL TIME GRANT WRITER ON THEIR STAFF. OR IF YOU HAVE PARENTS WHO ARE VERY VERY VOCAL ABOUT WHETHER IT BE THEATER ARTS AWARD DANCE OR. SPORTS AND THEY'RE PUSHING FOR THAT KIND OF. I EMPHASIS ON FUNDING THEY MAY NOT SPEAK UP ABOUT C. T. E. AND AGAIN IF IT SEEMS AS IF THEY'RE NOT INTERESTED IN THEY DON'T MOVE FORWARD WITH. APPLYING AGAIN WE MAY OR MAY HAVE IT MAY NOT BE THE MAJORITY OF STUDENTS BUT IT MAY BE IF YOU HAVE YOU KNOW A THOUSAND STUDENTS MAYBE TWO HUNDRED STUDENTS. THAT DON'T GET SERVE BECAUSE THEY EITHER DON'T KNOW ABOUT PROGRAMS THAT PARENTS AREN'T ADVOCATING FOR THEM THERE COULD BE NO INTEREST BY THE SCHOOL BOARD SO I REALLY WHATEVER MODEL IS CHOSEN I THINK AS A BODY. WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS A GROUP OF STUDENTS OUT THERE THAT THRIVE IN THIS TYPE OF SETTING THERE IS A GROUP OF STUDENTS THAT. LEAVE HIGH SCHOOL AND IMMEDIATELY. WANT TO GO INTO SOME TYPE OF PROFESSION WHETHER IT'S A PRE NURSING WHERE THEY'RE LIKE YOU SAY CONSTRUCTION. AND THE WE HAVE TO HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE FOR THEM THAT IS NOT THE SECONDARY ALTERNATIVE IT'S KIND OF LIKE WELL IF WE HAVE MONEY WILL FUND IT. THIS HAS TO BE PART OF WHAT WE DO BECAUSE NOT EVERYBODY IS GOING TO GO TO A TWO YEAR. OR FOUR YEAR AND BOTTOM LINE IS WE HAVE VERY VERY TALENTED PEOPLE. THAT GO INTO TRADES THAT GO INTO A BUSINESS MODELS AND THEY SUCCEED THERE AND WE HAVE MANY MANY YOUNG STUDENTS TRYING OUT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES SOMETIMES FOR FIVE AND SIX YEARS. KIND OF FLOUNDERING LOOKING FOR WHERE THERE'S MOST DO IN IT AND MANY CASES THAT THEY ACTUALLY WANT TO DO ELECTRICAL WORK WHATEVER THAT IS THAT'S KILLER TRADE BUT THEY'VE KIND OF BEEN. PUSHED INTO A DIFFERENT SETTING SO. IT'S MAKING SURE THAT WE REALLY PUSH THAT WE KEEP THAT THERE'S SOME KIND OF FAIR ADVANTAGE. THAT DOES NOT ELIMINATE A WHOLE GROUP OF. STUDENTS FROM DISTRICT TO DISTRICT. THANK YOU AYE NEXT DOCTOR WEBER. YEAH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I APPRECIATE ALL OF YOUR COMMENTS IN THEM. AND AND ALL MY COLLEAGUES COME IT'S IN SOME WAS LIKE THIS IS THE HOME RELIVING OF FIVE YEARS AGO WHAT LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. THOSE WHO REMEMBER THAT AND. AND SOME OF THE QUESTIONS I THINK WE HAVE A REST IN THE FACT THAT. THAT TOLD CONCEPT OF L. CFF WAS NEVER FULLY COMPLETED BECAUSE IT NEVER HAD A STRONG ACCOUNTABILITY DOCUMENT ATTACHED TO IT. NOW THE THE DASHBOARD IS AN EFFORT TO MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION AND AND PROBABLY CITY MAY HAVE MORE DATA AND MORE INFORMATION IN TERMS OF ACCOUNTABILITY THAT SOME OF THE OTHER. INDICATORS THAT WE HAVE TO DO WITH ACADEMIC SINCE WHAT HAVE BEEN TERMS OF WHAT DOES THAT REALLY MEAN. SO I THINK IT'S IT'S A IT'S THEM YOU KNOW THIS IS. A PROCESS IT SEEMS LIKE WE KEEP GOING THROUGH OVER AND OVER BECAUSE I IMMEDIATELY AFTER WE DID ALL CFF PEOPLE WANTED TO DO CATEGORICAL TO GIVE. AND THAT'S HOW CTE CAME INTO BEING WHERE PEOPLE HATE THE CATEGORICAL AS ALONG AS IT WAS TAKING UP THINGS THEY DIDN'T LIKE BUT THAT PEOPLE IN THE THINK THAT THEY DID LIKE SO. YOU ALSO THEY'RE IN A LIKE A CRISIS OF IDENTITY WITH REGARDS TO LC FF YOU KNOW YOU THE WONDERS OF LCF F.. THEN PEOPLE START SAY BUT WE GO MAKE YOU DO THIS AND SO THAT'S THE ONGOING CHALLENGE WE DON'T SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFY WHAT WE HOPE IS AN OUTCOME FOR ALL STUDENTS WITH REGARDS TO IT AND HOW DO WE MEASURE THAT IN THE VERY SCHOOLS THAT ARE THERE BECAUSE OTHERWISE. YOU'RE GONNA FIND YOURSELF WITH THAT NUMBER OF ISSUES THAT ARE COMING FORWARD REAL SOON. WITH A SPECIAL ED OR SOMETHING OF THAT WE'RE GOING TO FIND OURSELVES ONCE AGAIN FACTOR THAT CATEGORICAL MODEL WHERE WE SAY OKAY. YOU KNOW WE NEED THIS AND SINCE YOU DIDN'T DO IT WILL MAKE YOU DO IT AND SO THAT WE COULD DEVELOP A CATEGORICAL. AT ANOTHER CATEGORICAL AND THEN WILL FIND US ALSO THIRTY CATEGORICAL LIKE WE DID BEFORE ON EVERY ISSUE YOU COULD POSSIBLY IMAGINE AND IN SCHOOLS COMPLAINING WHATEVER WE WANT TO CALL IT IT HAS LIMITATIONS. OF FOR A PERSON'S LIFE NOW WE LOOK AT IT IS HAVING GREAT OPPORTUNITY BUT OFTENTIMES UNLESS IT IS SOMETHING LIKE LINK LEARNING AND IDYLLWILD WE HAVE MOVED TO LINK LEARNING READ THAN CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION. BECAUSE. IN THOSE CASES YOU GET STRONG ACADEMIC FOUNDATION. AND ONE OF THINGS YOU LEARN IN EDUCATION IS THAT THE ONLY REAL SKILLS WE HAVE THAT WILL LAST FOR TIMES READING AND MATH AND COMPUTATION. BECAUSE IF YOU AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE GOOD SKILLS AT THAT LEVEL. IF ANYTHING WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IS GONNA BE SHORT LIVED BECAUSE GOING TO CHANGE TOMORROW WITH TECHNOLOGY THAT'S COME WITH SOMETHING NEW COMING ALONG AS TO HOW YOU MEASURE SOMETHING OF WHAT YOU PUT IN PLACE A HOW YOU DEVELOP SOMETHING. AND SO WOULD NOT EQUIPPING OUR STUDENTS WITH REALLY STRONG. ACADEMIC FOUNDATIONS THAT ARE MEASURED AND SOMETIMES MANIFESTED IN THESE VARIOUS CAREER OPTIONS AND CHOICES. UP IT WILL BE SHORT LIVED IT'S GONNA BE IT'S GONNA BE LIKE OLD TO OF. THE BOOK IT PROGRAM THAT MOST OF YOU TALK ABOUT HOW WONDERFUL IT WAS A CHIU DRILLED HOLES MADE ESTRACE BUT. THEY WE DON'T DO THAT ANYMORE HER IN SO AS A RESULT REGARDLESS SO BOMB. AND WHAT I SAY ESTRACE KIDS GOING ON TIME BUT NOWADAYS BECAUSE SOMEONE HAS ASKED FOR ANYWHERE BUT. BUT SO I'M WONDERING WHY WE HAVEN'T MOVED OUR THINKING TOWARD WILL BUT LINK LEARNING MODEL. NOW THAT LINK LEARNS CONFERENCE THE OTHER DAY IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW YOU DEAL WITH THE CAREER OPTIONS YOU DEAL WITH A SOFT SKILL WHICH ALSO DEAL WITH THE HAS STRONG ACADEMIC FOUNDATION. SO THAT WHEN A STUDENT GRADUATES THEY HAVE THEY HAVE THEIR WE HAVE ALL THESE CAREERS IN THE CREEK PATHWAYS THAT THEY HAVE THIS WHOLE ARRAY OF STUFF THAT'S AVAILABLE TO THEM. AND AND I THINK AS LONG AS WE KEEP THE TERMINOLOGY CAREER TECH EDUCATION WE WE SOMETIMES SHORT CHANGE OUR KNOWLEDGE. SEE THAT LOOK WHAT HAPPENED OKAY. TO WHOM WE SHORT CHANGE OUR KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT WE SHOULD BE MOVING TO IN TERMS OF WHAT WHAT IS OUT THERE BECAUSE. YOU I HAVE A LOT OF KIDS WHO WANT ONE TO AN APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM AND WHO. BUT THEY HAVE SUCH POOR MATH SKILLS. BUT THEY CAN'T QUALIFY FOR A. B. A PROGRAM AND THAT'S SOUNDS UP APTLY HORRIBLE BUT THE STANDARDS ARE HIGH NOW. AND SHOW SO WE'RE NOT IF WE KEEP THE OLD MODEL AND WE KEEP MIDDLE CLASS IN A CLASS RATHER THAN THE INTEGRATION OF CURRICULUM THAT HAPPENS IN A. IN A LINK LEARNING ENVIRONMENT. I THINK WE SHOULD CHANGE OUR KIDS AND I DON'T THINK WOULD DO IN THIS WONDERFUL CAREER PREPARATION STUFF THAT WE THINK WE'RE MOVING INTO. BIKE BY CONFLICT TALKING ABOUT IT IN THIS WAY AS A COURSE IN OF COURSE THERE RATHER THAN A WHOLE WAY OF THINKING THAT EXIST ON SCHOOLS WITH REGARDS TO CURRICULUM AND. AND THE INTEGRATION OF THAT CURRICULUM INTO THE CAREERS IN THE PATHWAYS AND THINGS LIKE THAT BUT ALSO VERY STRONG FOUNDATIONS A WE GOT AWAY FROM BOTH HIT BECAUSE IT WAS A VERY LIMITING. AND OFTEN IT WAS AS OUR CHAIR TALK ABOUT TRACKING CERTAIN KIDS IT A PATHWAY THAT THEY COULDN'T GET OUT OF AND END UP AT THE END OF THE LINE WITH VERY LIMITED SKILLS THEY COULD WORK FOR THAT. PERIOD OF TIME BECAUSE THEY WERE MEETING THE NEEDS WITHIN ONE THAT PROFESSION CHANGE THEIR SHIFT IT. THEY DON'T HAVE THE SKILLS TO SHIFT WITH THE. SO I HOPE THAT OUR THINKING GETS BIGGER THAN WHERE WE ARE THAT IT REALLY STARTS IMPACTING THE FULL CURRICULUM. AND. AND THAT WE REALLY START TALKING ABOUT LINK LEARNING AND AND HOW WE LINK UP THESE THINGS ALL SCHOOLS THAT HAVE DONE LINK LEARNING HAVE AMAZING RESULTS. IN TERMS OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE AND THEIR ACTIONS WHEN THEY LEAVE. A AND AND WHAT THEY CAN DO AND AND AND AND AND THE WORLD IS CHANGING SO RAPIDLY. THAT THOSE TWO SKILLS OF THIS COMPUTATIONAL SKILLS. AND EURO OF LITERACY SKILLS ARE TO THE TWO SKILLS THAT WORK YOU THROUGH LIFE RIGHT NOW. A AND GOT WILL AND AND MOST OF OUR KIDS WILL CHANGE PROFESSIONS A ZILLION TIMES I'M A PROBABLY A DINOSAUR ANYONE ABOUT A PROFESSION FOR FORTY YEARS. UP THEIR PART WILL BE MANY OF THOSE LEFT IN THE WORLD UP BECAUSE OUR FOLKS OF THAT YOUNG PEOPLE GOING TO CHANGE SO OFTEN. AND THEY SHOULD HAVE THE SKILLS TO ADAPT AND CHANGE AND TO RECREATE THEMSELVES A BASED ON THE INTEREST THAT THEY HAVE BEEN BASED ON THE CHANGING MARKETPLACE. SO I'M JUST HOPING THAT AS WE TALK CT <u><c.green>%</c></u> WHATEVER THAT WE REALLY MOVE TO SOMETHING ELSE. AND THAT WE DON'T SEE THIS AS SUCH A LIMITED THING BUT THAT IT IS REALLY INCORPORATED. IN ALL OF THE COURSES AND THE WHOLE K. TWELVE SYSTEM. THAT HELPS YOUNG PEOPLE REALLY DEFINE WHAT THEY WANTED TO IN THEIR LIFE WITHOUT LIMITATIONS. THANK YOU THOMAS BURKE. AND SO I WOULD AGREE WITH DOCTOR WEBER AND THAT MY MOM ALWAYS TOLD ME WHATEVER I WOULD END UP DOING I PROBABLY HAVEN'T HEARD OF TODAY. AND I AM PERSONALLY RIGHT NOW SHE'S WRONG TO THEM EXACTLY WHERE SHE STARTED. YOU KNOW RYAN AND LET THEM ASSEMBLY MEMBER IS EXACTLY SHE WAS WERE AND I WAS BORN SO. THAT MAY NOT APPLY TO ME BUT. I I AGREE WITH DOCTOR WEBER IN THE FACT THAT THAT PROBABLY APPLIES TO MOST YOUNG PEOPLE HOWEVER I WILL SAY I DO THEY HAVE TO. KIND OF GO THE OTHER DIRECTION ON ON THE SHORT LIVED PART OF IT I THINK. I I COME FROM A COMMUNITY THAT WOULD BE HAPPY TO BE HAVE A CERTIFICATION THAT ALTHOUGH MAY NOT BE PERMANENT AND MAY BE. SLIGHTLY SHORT LIVED ENOUGH THAT'S TEN YEARS OR FIFTEEN YEARS WOULD. WOULD BE THANKFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO START A LIFE. AND TO START A CAREER. AND SO WHEN I LOOK AT THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A HUNDRED THOUSAND AND JOBS THAT ARE NOT FILLED WITH CAREERS THAT WOULD BE A CERTIFICATION WOULD WOULD PUT THEM IN AND PUT PUT THE KIDS INTO. CAREER OPPORTUNITIES WHERE THEY CAN BUY A HOME WITH A START AT SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS YEAR AND THOSE ARE IN MY DISTRICT THOSE ARE IT THOSE ARE. TECHNICAL JOBS IF THEY JUST NEED A CERTIFICATION AND I DO SEE THAT WE HAVE BUSINESSES THAT ARE STARTING TO UNDERSTAND THAT AND CERTIFY THEMSELVES. BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S BUSINESSES SOLE RESPONSIBILITY TO FILL THEIR OWN JOBS I THINK THAT WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO THE CHILDREN THAT WE HAD TO KATE TO CREATE THOSE JOBS. OUGHT TO CREATE THOSE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEM. YOU KNOW I LOOK AT MY WORKFORCE INVESTMENT BOARD THEY'VE DONE A FANTASTIC JOB CONNECTING AYE EDUCATION WITH AEROSPACE OR WITH. OR OR WITH MEDICAL INDUSTRY AND ALL THESE OTHER THINGS. I WILL SAY THIS I SAY TO THANKS. ONE I THINK THE STUDY SHOULD OCCUR TECHNICAL EDUCATION HAVE ENCOURAGE STUDENTS TO HAVE A REASON TO GO TO SCHOOL. THEY HAVE IT'S APPLICABLE THEY SEE WHEN THEIR SKILLS AYE IT WE SAY THAT'S IN MY DISTRICT I HAVE EA SPORTS AND WE ALWAYS SAY MATH LEADS TO MADDEN OF MORE MY KIDS KNEW THAT GOING TO MATH CLASS WOULD LEAD THEM TO BE ABLE TO CREATE GAMES LIKE MADDEN. THEY'D SHOW UP. AND SO I DON'T SEE IT AS A LIMITED OPPORTUNITY CREW TECHNICAL EDUCATION I SEE IT AS AN OPPORTUNITY INTO THEM. TO KEEP KIDS ENGAGED TO KEEP YOUNG PEOPLE ENGAGED IN TO WATCH THE MOVE INTO THE NEXT PHASE OF THEIR LIVES. AND WHETHER THAT IS A CAREER OR WHETHER THAT IS THE NEXT LEVEL OF EDUCATION I THINK IT'S VITALLY IMPORTANT TO US THAT THE. THAT ALL OF OUR STUDENTS GET THE RPG DO THAT WHETHER WE ARE IN DISADVANTAGED MEANS OUR COMMUNITIES. IN WHICH THERE ARE JUST JOB OPPORTUNITIES. I'M I DO HAVE ONE QUESTION AND I DO AT TWO QUESTIONS ACTUALLY ONE I AM CONCERNED ABOUT. WHAT? ASSEMBLY MEMBER O'DONNELL MENTIONED ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT IT'S VERY A REGIONAL APPROACH BUT ALSO AND TRYING TO MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND I MIGHT HAVE MISSED HEARD YOU. AND I WANNA MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND THE PROCESS BY WHICH THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS DIVIDING UP THIS MONEY SO ARE YOU SAYING THAT THE MONEY WILL BE DIVIDED EQUALLY OVER EACH CONSORTIUM. OR HOW EXPLAIN TO ME EXACTLY HOW YOU SEE THIS WORKING BECAUSE THE AYE I HEARD GRANT PROGRAM BUT THEN I HEARD YOU SAY THAT WE WERE MOVING AWAY FROM THE GRANT MODEL AND I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND A HUNDRED PERCENT. BEFORE WE MOVE FORWARD THINK YOU. SO THIRTY AND THE FUNDING IS ALLOCATED TO THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE WHO WILL THEN USE THE A FORMULA TO DISTRIBUTE IT DOWN TO THE CONSORTIA SO THE FORMULA IS. BASED ON THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IN THE REGION AND THE PROJECTED JOB OPENINGS IN THE REGION AND THE SEVEN THROUGH TWELVE ABA IN THE REGION. SO EACH EACH REGION'S CONSORTIUM CONSORTIUM ALLOCATION WILL WILL VARY THAT BASED ON THAT FORMULA SAID IT'S NOT A SET. YES. THANK YOU ARE MR MURATSUCHI. THANK YOU. SO I SOME OF. MY COLLEAGUES KNOW THAT I SAT ON THE. BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF AGED BY JP A CURRENT TECHNICAL EDUCATION. THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA REGIONAL OCCUPATIONAL CENTER A LOCATED MY DISTRICT IN TORRANCE AND DOWNED AYE I CAN ATTEST TO WELL A LOT OF WHAT MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT THE. THESE DID THAT THE VALUE OF. NOT NOT ONLY THE CURRENT TECHNICAL EDUCATION BUT THE LINK LEARNING ASPECT OF IT OF OF OF MAKING SURE THAT TO. THAT THERE IS SAID YOU WERE TEACHING SOLID. READING AND AND AND MATH SKILLS AS PART OF THAT TEACHING OF THESE THESE WORK SKILLS. SO I. BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE I HAVE TO CAN A CONCERNS ARE TWO QUESTIONS ONE IS. THE LA OWES. WRITTEN ANALYSES TALK ABOUT SCHOOL DISTRICTS APPLYING FOR. A V.. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED. GRANTS. GRANTS THAT WOULD BE ISSUED THROUGH THE. THE CONSORTIA BUT. WILL GPAS ALSO BE ABLE TO APPLY FOR THESE THESE FUNDS AND SECOND ARE THERE REGULATIONS. THAT EXIST OR THAT WILL THAT DID THAT ARE IN THE TRAILER LANGUAGE OR ANYWHERE ELSE. AS STE THAT THAT DEFINES HOW THESE REGIONAL CONSORTIA ARE GOVERNED. I APOLOGIZE FOR HAVING MY AND MY BACK TO YOU IN MY RESPONSE BUT IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF AN AWKWARD SET UP HERE SO I AM. JP EIGHT ARE ELIGIBLE IT'S THAT'S THE SAME. ELIGIBILITY. PULL AS UNDER CITY INCENTIVE FRANCIS SCHOOL DISTRICTS COUNTY OFFICES CHARTERS I'M ARE APPEASING APA'S ARE ELIGIBLE. JP'S DO HAVE A LOWER MATCH UNDER OUR PROPOSAL SO IT'S A ONE TO ONE. RATHER THAN THE TWO TO ONE FOR THE OTHER I'M AT THAT THE OTHER APPLICANTS. NAY POLITICALLY IF ABOUT YOUR IT YOUR THAT THE SECOND QUESTION ARE ARE ARE THERE ARE REGULATIONS. DATA DESCRIBE HOW THESE REGIONAL CONSORTIA ARE TO BE GOVERNED SO EACH OF BUT I'M EACH OF THEM REGIONAL CONSORTIA I'M HAVE TO DO A REGIONAL PLAN AND AND NOT PLANNED THEY DESCRIBE THEIR GOVERNANCE MODELS ABOUT IS SOMETHING THAT'S DECIDED. LOCALLY BY THE REGION AND BUT IT IS DESCRIBED IN THEIR PLANTS SO TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT. I MEAN IF. IF THE FUNDS ARE GOING TO BE. AS AS YOU INDICATED PASSED THROUGH THE CHANCES OFFICE TO THE CONSORTIA. YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD PREVENT. BUT IF WILL NEVER WANT TO SOUND LIKE DIFFERENT CONSORTIA WILL BE GOVERNED ACCORDING TO THEIR OWN RULES AND SO EACH CONSORTIA WILL LOOK DIFFERENT. HAVE WHAT IS TO PREVENT. YOU KNOW GOOD CONSORTIA FROM FROM HAVING YOU KNOW SOME BIAS EITHER FOR. PROGRAMS THAT ARE ADMINISTERED BY THEIR LOCAL COMMUNICABLE AGE AS OPPOSED TO THE LOCAL. SCHOOL DISTRICTS. DO WHAT WEATHERED I MEAN IT JUST SEEMS LIKE. IF WE'RE GOING TO BE CREATING. A NEW LEVEL OF GOVERNANCE. THROUGH THESE REGIONAL CONSORTIA THEN IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE. SOME UNIFORM RULES THAT WOULD ALLOW OF FOR THOSE GRANTS TO BE A. DISTRIBUTED FAIRLY. AND AND AND NOT. CONTROLLED ARE BIASED TOWARD. YOU KNOW THE THE LOCAL CAN UNICOLOR CHEN THEIR PROGRAMS. I I JUST WOULD LIKE. MORE ASSURANCE THAT THAT THAT THESE GRANTS TO PS A. YOU KNOW. ADMINISTERED FAIRLY AND AND AND THAT. OKAY THERE THAT THERE'D BE SOME BASIC ROLES AS TO HOW THIS IS GOING TO WORK. IN A MISTER MISTER MURATSUCHI IF I MAY OF USE PRE PREFLIGHT RESPONDED THAT THAT'S A VERY COMPLICATED ANSWER I THINK. AND THAT'S WHAT I HAD ON EARLIER I THINK IT'S REALLY WE'RE REALLY OUGHT TO DIVE INTO THAT IN THE IN BUDGET SUB TO FOR SURE BECAUSE I DON'T UNDERSTAND. I THINK EXPLAIN AGAIN AND I UNDERSTAND I UNDERSTAND. A THOMAS BURKE THEY'RE GONNA GIVE THE MONEY TO CONSORTIUM MY CHALLENGES HOUSING CONSORTIUM GOING TO DELIVER SO I DON'T WANNA GET FURTHER IT TOO FAR TOO FAR INTO THAT RIGHT NOW IF YOU COULD JUST GIVE A SHORT ANSWER BECAUSE WE DO HAVE MISTER KILEY. WHO ARE RUNNING SIGNIFICANTLY BEHIND HER AS RIGHT NOW I'LL JUST POINT OUT THAT I'M UNDER THE EXISTING PROGRAM IN STATUTE THERE ARE ARE REQUIREMENTS THAT THE CONSORTIUM COLLABORATE WITH VARIOUS DIFFERENT DO YOU SO? I'M HIGH INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION IN THEIR REGION ELEAZAR. CIVIC LEADERS THAT THERE'S A WHOLE HOST SO IT'S NOT NECESSARILY A COMMUNITY COLLEGE SUFFICIENT WITHIN THE CONSORTIUM IT REALLY AS A BROAD SPECTRUM OF STAKEHOLDERS AT THAT POINT. THANK YOU MISTER KILEY WILL BE OUR OUR LAST QUESTION ON FOR THIS PANEL. I THINK YOU HAVE A QUESTION FOR MS. COLLINS I SUED THE LA AS RECOMMENDATION IS THAT WE TAKE CARE OF THE LCF APPROACH TO AYE. TO. CT AND CAN YOU EXPLAIN A LITTLE MORE WITHOUT DETAIL YOU BASICALLY RECOMMENDING THAT WE JUST. AUGMENT. THAT THE FUNDING TO WHATEVER DEGREE. AND THEN. YOU KNOW I SEE HOW THEY DO BY THE COLLAGEN ENCOURAGING THIS INDICATOR. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE RECOMMEND IS TAKING THE LC FF APPROACH WHICH PROVIDE SIXTEEN PERCENT MORE FUNDING THAN THE MIDDLE SCHOOL BASE RATE. I'M TO ACCOUNT FOR THE HIGHER COSTS OF THINGS LIKE. CREW TECHNICAL EDUCATION AND. COLLEGE PREPAREDNESS THIS IS THE ORIGINAL APPROACH THAT THE STATE DETERMINED AT WHICH TO TAKE FOR CT <u><c.green>.</c></u> BACK IN A TWENTY TWELVE OR TWENTY THIRTEEN FOURTEEN WE ADOPTED THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA THE THOUGHT WOULD BE THAT FOR MANY OF THE CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS GIFTED AND TALENTED. FOR EXAMPLE. CT  <u><c.green>THAT INSTEAD OF HAVING</c></u> DISTINCT EARMARKED FUNDING FOR THOSE PROGRAMS THAT WOULD REQUIRE DISTRICTS TO. PERFORM A LOT OF COMPLEX COMPLIANCE BASED ACTIVITIES THAT CREATED. INEQUITABLE FUNDING ACROSS DISTRICT BASED ON HISTORICAL. VARIABLES THAT BE LCF APPROACH WOULD PROVIDE MORE FUNDING TO STUDENTS BASED ON WHETHER THEY WERE LOW INCOME ENGLISH LEARNERS ARE FOSTER YOU. AND THE THOUGHT WAS INSTEAD OF DECIDING. HERE IN SACRAMENTO WHAT LOCAL PRIORITIES WOULD BE WE WOULD WILL ALLOW THE LOCAL SET ASIDE THROUGH. ON THE AL CAPP PROCESS WHERE STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING PARENTS AND TEACHERS AND OTHERS WOULD COME TO THE TABLE AND DETERMINE HOW THEY WOULD SERVE STUDENTS. TO BE NOT ONLY COLLEGE AND CAREER READY BUT ALSO ENGAGED. AT WE HAVE A WE HAVE EIGHT STATE PRIORITIES THAT WE WE WANTED SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO ADDRESS. SO WHAT OUR RECOMMENDATION IS FOR FOR MANY OF THE. FOR MANY OF THE REASONS THAT THAT US SOME OF THE MEMBERS BROUGHT UP TODAY CONCERNS THAT NOT EVERYBODY IS GOING TO APPLY FOR A GRANT FOR EXAMPLE. WHAT OUR RECOMMENDATION IS IS THROUGH THE LC FF THE EXPECTATION IS THAT EVERYONE PERFORMS COLLEGE AND CAREER READINESS ACTIVITIES? WE HOLD EVERYBODY ACCOUNTABLE NOT JUST THOSE THAT ARE RECEIVING FUNDS FOR IT AS WE DID UNDER THE RCP DAYS BUT THE BUT EVERY HIGH SCHOOL WAS HELD ACCOUNTABLE THROUGH THE. NEW ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM. THE NEW ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM HAS TAKEN AWHILE TO ROLL OUT THERE SOME CONCERNS WITH THE INDICATORS RIGHT WITHOUT A TRANSITION PERIOD BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF ALL CFF THAT PROVIDE THAT EXTRA FUNDING FOR HIGH SCHOOLS. I OR ANYONE ACTUALLY ON THAT WASN'T FULLY FUNDED FOR ANY I'M GREAT SPAN. SO OUR OUR RECOMMENDATION IS CONTEST TO CONTINUE DOWN THAT PATH OF REQUIRING EVERYONE TO PROVIDE CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION AND HOLDING THEM ACCOUNTABLE FOR IT. SO I GUESS I THE ISSUE IS THAT THE WAY THE INDICATORS CURRENTLY WRITTEN IS IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY DO THAT RIGHT THERE IS THAT YOU CAN SATISFY THIS INDICATOR THROUGH A VARIETY OF. MEANS THAT THAT DON'T NECESSARILY INCLUDE ANY VOCATIONAL OFFERING AT ALL IS THAT IS THAT RIGHT. YES WE AGREE THAT IF THE LEGISLATURE HAS CONCERNS WITH THAT THAT IT COULD MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE INDICATOR. STATE BOARD IS PLANNING TO ADD OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS MORE CAREER EDUCATION. METRICS INTO THE INDICATOR INCLUDING WORK BASED LEARNING. AND. CERTIFICATES BUT WE BELIEVE THAT IF THE LEGISLATURE HAS ITS CONCERNS IT CAN IT HAS THE POWER TO. MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO ADDRESS THAT VERY CONCERNED BECAUSE THAT'S CONCERNED WE'VE HEARD AS WELL BUT I WOULD NOTE THAT WHILE THIS IS OUR RECOMMENDATION WE WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS SIGNIFICANT INTEREST IN CREATING. A CATEGORICAL AND EARMARKED PROGRAM AND THAT'S WHY IN OUR ANALYSIS WE PROVIDED. SOME RECOMMENDATIONS FOR HOW YOU MIGHT STRUCTURE THAT WE THINK THAT ACCOUNTABILITY EVEN IF YOU TAKE A CATEGORICAL ROUTE IS REALLY IMPORTANT IMPROVING ACCOUNTABILITY AND IF YOU TAKE THE L. CFF ROUTE. WE HAVE SOME IDEAS FOR IMPROVEMENT AS WELL INCLUDING. LONGER TERM INDICATORS WE RIGHT NOW DON'T KNOW AFTER A STUDENT COMPLETES HIGH SCHOOL. IF SAY GOING TO COMMITTEE COLLEGE INTO A FOUR YEAR INTO AN APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM. SO WE THINK AT THE VERY LEAST THOSE TYPES OF IMPROVEMENTS COULD BE MADE OF NO MATTER WHAT APPROACH YOU DECIDE TO TAKE RIGHT YEAH I GUESS THAT'S WHAT I SEE IS. THE TENSION HERE IS THAT. I MEAN SEPARATE FROM THE QUESTION OF ACCOUNTABILITY WE DON'T REALLY SEEM TO HAVE ANY VISION AS TO WHAT THE APPROPRIATE. YOU KNOW AND GOAL IS OUT WE SEEM TO HAVE SOME AGREEMENT MORE CT WOULD BE GOOD. BY. IT DOES NOT MEAN THAT EVERY STUDENT SHOULD HAVE SOME EXPOSURE TO IT DOES NOT MEAN THAT EVERY STUDENT SHOULD HAVE A. VARIETY OF CAREER OFFERINGS WITHIN THEIR DISTRICT WITHIN THEIR REGION AND DIE THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE ANY CONSENSUS ON THAT AND YET WERE. DEBATING SORT OF WHAT'S THE BEST FUNDING MECHANISM TOWARDS AN. UNDEFINED GOAL. SO I DON'T KNOW IF THAT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE HAS AYE UNANSWERED ABOUT THAT'S TO KIND OF WHAT. WHAT OUR VISION IS HERE BUT THE OTHER POINT ALL HAD IS THAT I THINK THAT YOU KNOW DOCTOR WEBER'S COMMENTS ARE WORTH TAKING REALLY SERIOUSLY AND PART OF THE REASON FOR THAT IS TO BE A DIFFERENT CONVERSATION OF WERE SITTING? IN A STATE THAT HAS THE BEST K. TWELVE EDUCATION IN THE COUNTRY. AND WE DO HAVE MANY MANY OUTSTANDING SCHOOLS IN THE STATE BUT WE ACTUALLY HAVE ABOUT THE WORST PERFORMANCE WHEN IT COMES TO TRADITIONAL ECONOMIC INDICATORS IN CASE THROUGH TWELVE. AND WHEN YOU'RE DISCUSSING CT  <u><c.green>OF</c></u> OCCASIONAL EDUCATION IN THAT CONTEXT THEN IT ALMOST SEEMS LIKE SUMMER READY TO JUMP AT THE IDEA THAT THIS IS SOMEHOW AN ALTERNATIVE AND IT CAN'T I DON'T THINK BE. CONCEIVED OF THAT WAY THAT. THAT THIS THAT THESE OFFERINGS ARE VITAL TO HAVE AND I THINK THAT EVERY GUY STUDENTS SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO VOCATIONAL EDUCATION BUT I IT'S NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR BASIC. OTHER BASIC EDUCATION THAT EVERY CHILD IN CALIFORNIA I SHOULD BE GUARANTEED A WERE FALLING FAR FAR SHORT. ON ON THIS MORE TRADITIONAL METRICS I GUESS JUST DIED ANOTHER THE CHAIR WANTS TO MOVE ON BUT I'M. YOU YOU DID TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE METRICS WE HAVE. FOR HOW CD PROGRAMS ARE DOING I DO YOU TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT THOSE ARE AND THEN WHETHER YOU'VE NOTICED I'VE. WHETHER THERE'S ANY CORRELATION BETWEEN DISTRICTS THAT DO WELL BY TRADITIONAL ACADEMIC HE TWELVE METRICS AND THOSE THAT DO WELL I WOULD CT  <u><c.green>OR THOSE.</c></u> I'M NOT NECESSARILY CORRELATED REAP BRIEFLY PLEASE BECAUSE TEAM AND WE ACTUALLY DON'T HAVE THE LONG TERM DATA ADDS THAT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S HAD HAD MENTIONED. THAT WE'VE HAD REPORTING REQUIREMENTS IN BOTH STATUTES GOVERNING BOTH PROGRAMS AND WE DO NOT HAVE THOSE SPECIFIC OUTCOME MEASURES TO POINT TO. AND THAT'S THE REASON WHY WE'RE STRUCTURING OUR PROPOSAL TO USE THE LAUNCH BOARD BECAUSE THAT THAT HAS SHOWN SUCCESS IN BEING ABLE TO TRACK THROUGH. THE TRACK COMMITTEE COLLEGE STUDENTS BACK THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL AND INTO THE WORK FORCE AND WE BELIEVE THAT BY INCLUDING THIS DATA ON THE LAUNCH PORTABLE UNIT POTENTIALLY EXPAND THE AVAILABILITY OF METRICS TO BUILD OUT THAT INDICATOR. THANK YOU. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE YOUR PARTICIPATION YOUR INFORMATION AND. ELEVEN MEMBERS OUT HERE TODAY SO THANK YOU. THAT TO ME THIS ISSUES ABOUT SKILL DEVELOPMENT AND RICHMOND. AND ULTIMATELY THIS ACADEMIC SUCCESS AND JOB SUCCESS I THINK IT'S PRETTY MUCH A NO BRAINER SO WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY AND WE WERE PUSHING THE SPORT. UNITY IN A CLASSROOM YOU CAN MEMORIZE YOUR YOUR YOUR FRACTIONS BUT IN THE REAL WORLD YOU CAN APPLY THEM I THINK THAT'S WHAT THIS IS REALLY ABOUT SO THANK YOU. WITH THAT WILL BRING UP OUR NEXT PANEL PANEL NUMBER TWO HIGHLIGHTING QUALITY CT PROGRAMS. METRO RED WILL COME UP. ALYSSA LYNCH SUPERINTENDENT GRAND HAYDEN STUDENT. JIM KANNO IS A BOARD MEMBER IF YOU COULD COME FORWARD PLEASE. AND IF YOU COULD PLEASE BE AS EFFICIENT AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE WE ARE IN A SHORT TIME WHEN WE'RE RUNNING LATE. BECAUSE OF THE INTEREST IN THIS TOPIC I MIGHT ADD WHICH IS A VERY GOOD. I DON'T THINK HE'S HERE TO MARK. RAINY IS NOT. GREAT THANK YOU. I JUST GO AHEAD AND INTRODUCE YOURSELF AND YOU MAY PROCEED WHEN READY. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME SALICYLATE INCH TOM THINK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY. I'M GONNA JUST GONNA MOVE INTO THIS AND SAY THANK YOU FOR SAYING IT'S A NO BRAINER I FEEL LIKE IT IS I WAS VERY PLEASED TO HEAR A LOT OF MEMBERS. OF THE PANEL TODAY AND ARE SHOULD SAY ASSEMBLY MEMBERS AND SENATORS I'M BORED WITH FUNDING THIS FOR THE FUTURE TWO HUNDRED MILLION OR BATH. SHORTLY I WILL INTRODUCE MY TWO GUESTS AS WELL SO. I WANNA SAY THAT I'M THE SUPERINTENDENT FOR METROPOLITAN EDUCATION DISTRICT IN SAN JOSE. WE OPERATE ONE OF THE LARGEST CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION CENTERS IN CALIFORNIA. WE SERVE SIX SCHOOL DISTRICTS THIRTY FIVE HIGH SCHOOLS. AND WE ARE AN EXTENSION OF OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS THE PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE ARE JUST TOO COSTLY TO OFFER ON THIRTY FIVE HIGH SCHOOL CAMPUSES. WE MAXIMIZE THE DOLLARS FOR OUR DISTRICTS. SO JOINING ME TO MY RIGHT TODAY IS GRANT HATE AND A FORMER STUDENT FROM CAMPBELL UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT. AND TO MY LEFT IS JIM CANOVA SEVEN CLARA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AND METROID SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER. I'M HERE TODAY BECAUSE I'M PASSIONATE ABOUT HER TECHNICAL EDUCATION. AND IT DESERVES THE FUNDING AND AGAIN I'M GLAD YOU ALREADY AGREE. THIS SHOULDN'T EVEN BE A QUESTION. IF CTU SHOULD BE FUNDED OR NOT. MATH ENGLISH AND SCIENCE NO ONE EVER ASKS IF YOU'RE GONNA FIND MOUTH. OR SCIENCE OR ENGLISH OR SOCIAL STUDIES. CT PROVIDE STUDENTS. THE SKILLS THAT ARE EMPLOYERS ARE BEGGING FOR IN CALIFORNIA. THE TIME WHEN FACEBOOK PROJECTS TO HUNDRED THOUSAND JOBS OPEN. OVER THERE THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. IN CALIFORNIA COMPANIES ARE STRUGGLING TO FIND. WELL SKILLED. EMPLOYEES WE CAN'T AFFORD NOT TO FIND CURRENT TECHNICAL EDUCATION. I AM IN SUPPORT OF THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION BEING ALLOCATED FOR AB SEVENTEEN FORTY THREE OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. I'M SORRY THREE YEARS. AND ALONG WITH THAT COMES THE INCREASED ACCOUNTABILITY AND WE'RE DEFINITELY INTERESTED IN THAT. AND ALIGNING IT WITH THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL DASHBOARD. HOWEVER I'M NOT IN FAVOR OF JUST THREE YEARS OF FUNDING. I'M IN FAVOR OF PERMANENT FUNDING. MY FIRST POINT TODAY IS IF ELSIE FF IS BEING RESTORED TO THE TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT LEVEL. THEN SEE TO YOU SHOULD BE RESTORED TO THE TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT LEVEL. TO THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION THAT WE HAD. IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT. WHEN STUDENTS TAKE A MATH CLASS IN HIGH SCHOOL THERE ARE FOUR DIFFERENT TYPES OF MATH CLASSES THAT WE ALL KNOW ABOUT. ALGEBRA GEOMETRY CALCULUS. TRIGONOMETRY. THERE'S NO DEBATE ALL OF THE CLASSES ARE FUNDED. ONE STUDENTS TAKE A CTU CLASS THERE ARE FOUR TYPES OF CLASSES THERE'S A CD CLASS ON A HIGH SCHOOL CAMPUS. THERE'S A SEA TO YOU CLASS COUPLED WITH CORE ACADEMIC CLASSES WHICH I HIGHLY. HIGHLY EMPHASIZE THEY ARE VERY. VERY SUCCESSFUL. THERE ARE TWO HOUR IN THREE HOUR CLASSES ON CAMPUSES AND CENTERS LIKE OURS IN SAN JOSE. CENTERS ARE OFTEN FORGOTTEN THERE ALWAYS FORGOTTEN AND LEFT OUT. AND THEN THERE ARE THE LINK LEARNING CLASSES. I BELIEVE THAT THOSE ARE VALUABLE AS WELL. LEGISLATORS NEED TO FIND ALL CITY PROGRAMS. WITHOUT BEING COMPETITIVE WITHOUT HAVING TO MATCH DOLLARS ARE SPENT THE LAST FIVE YEARS WRITING GRANTS AND MATCHING DOLLARS AND I REALLY DON'T HAVE. IN IN THE FUTURE TAKING ALONE. MY SECOND POINT. STUDENTS PARTICIPATING SCHOOLS AND REGIONAL SEE TO YOU CENTERS TO PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY RIGOR CITY PROGRAMS. HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER ACHIEVEMENT. IN READING IN MATH AND SCIENCE. THESE STUDENTS HAVE INTEGRATED LEARNING APART APPROACH. THEY'RE LEXILE LEVEL IS HIGHER. THEY READ AT THE COLLEGE LEVEL. WHEN THEY READ AN AUTOMOTIVE MANUAL IT'S COLLEGE IN BUSINESS LEVEL. THE STUDENTS LEARN SCIENCE IN DENTAL. THEY LEARN THE MATH IN CONSTRUCTION THEY LEARN SCIENCE IN VETERINARIAN. THEY LEARNED TO READ BETTER AN AUTOMOTIVE. NINETY THREE PERCENT OF THE CTU STUDENTS GRADUATE. COMPARED TO EIGHTY PERCENT OF NON SAFETY STUDENTS. I'M GONNA ALSO TELL YOU TO PLEASE TAKE A LOOK AT OUR CENTER DATA AND THE DATA FOR THE CALIFORNIA TO ANSWER SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE ASKED EARLIER. CTT PROGRAMS REDUCE THE DROP OUT RATE. THEY INCREASED THE GRADUATION RATE. SEE TO YOU STUDENTS ARE OUR FIREFIGHTERS THEY SAVED NAPA. SEAT TO SEE DO YOU STUDENTS ARE YOUR DENTIST THAT TAKE CARE OF YOUR TEETH. SEE DO YOU STUDENTS ARE YOUR MEDICAL ASSISTANCE THAT TAKE CARE OF YOU. SO YOU DO YOU STUDENTS HAVE BEEN YOUR TEACHERS. SAY TO YOU STUDENTS ARE YOUR VETERINARIAN SET CARE FOR YOUR PETS. THEIR PHARMACIST PREPARING YOUR MEDICATION. AN AUTO MECHANICS THAT TAKE CARE OF YOUR BREAKS THAT CAN TAKE YOUR LIFE. IF. NOT DONE CORRECTLY. WITHOUT SUSTAIN DEDICATED CTE FUNDING CT PROGRAMS AND SUCCESSFUL CENTER BASED PROGRAMS. ARE AT RISK. AS THE LOCAL COST PRESSURES ON THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE INCREASED IN THE PRIORITIES THREATEN THE VIABILITY OF THESE PROGRAMS WHICH IS WHY CD OR I'M SORRY Y. CALIFORNIA IS STRUGGLING TO FIND. TALENT TO FILL THEIR JOBS. IN CLOSING I WAS OCCURRED TECH KIT. IN COLLEGE. AND I'VE BEEN IN PUBLIC EDUCATION FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS AS A TEACHER. MY FIRST YEAR I WAS ASKED WALK TO THE FAX MACHINE. TO FAX MY LETTER OF SUPPORT FOR DEDICATED PERMANENT ONGOING FUNDING FOR. KURT TECHNICAL EDUCATION. I WOULD LIKE THIS TO BE THE LAST TIME THAT WE HAVE TO ADVOCATE FOR PROTECT FUNDING. PLEASE GIVE. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BIG GIFT OF AB SEVENTEEN. FORTY THREE AND MAKE IT A DEDICATED ONGOING FUNDING STREAM FOR OUR STUDENTS AND OUR ECONOMY. CALIFORNIA IS FORTY FIRST AND FUNDING FOR PUPILS WE CAN DO BETTER AND WE MUST. WE CANNOT AFFORD NOT TO DO THIS. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF DONALD FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. HER STUDENTS GO TO COLLEGE BECAUSE OF CREW TECHNICAL EDUCATION. I NEED EVERYBODY TO STOP SAYING IT'S FOR THOSE OTHER KIDS IT'S OR SOMEBODY ELSE'S CHILD I WAS. ONE OF THOSE KIDS. FINALLY. I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE MICHELLE AMERICAN AUDIENCE IN THE FIRST ROW. SHE WAS ONE A MY STUDENTS TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO. IT'S BEEN A LONG JOURNEY. AND I'M GOING TO SAY NUMBER GRANTS NUMBER MATCHING I DON'T HAVE THE STAFF AND I PLAY DON'T HAVE THE WHEREWITHAL TO DO THIS FOR MANY MORE YEARS. UNLESS YOU GIVE US FUNDING AND INCLUDES CENTERS. CENTERS WERE IF THE STUDENTS THAT NEED THE IN DEPTH LOOK AT A CAREER THANK YOU GET TO WORK RIGHT AWAY AND CONTINUE COLLEGE. SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME I'M GONNA TURN IT OVER TO GRANT. OUR TESTIMONY OP. BEFORE WE GO TO GRANT DO WE HAVE ANY MEMBERS THAT WANT TO. SPEAK TO OUR SUPERINTENDENT. I JUST WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE YOUR VERY. SINCERE TESTIMONY I THINK THERE'S MANY IN THE AUDIENCE I MYSELF OF ANNA EDUCATOR FOR THIRTY YEARS AND I THINK THAT YOU STATE. WHAT MANY OF US FEEL THERE'S ALWAYS I THINK? IN EDUCATION THERE'S BEEN SOME HIERARCHY ON AND I KNOW EVEN AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SOMETIMES THOSE THAT ARE TEACHING. AYE IN THE C. T. E. THEY'RE NOT EVEN INCLUDED UP WITH THE REGULAR STAFF PROFESSORS AND SO FORTH ARE CONSIDERED A SOMETIMES OF THE OFFSITE DE THEY DON'T MANY TIMES EVEN HAVE THEM ON IN THE SAME CAMPUS THERE THERE THEY HAVE AN OFFICE SOMEWHERE ELSE SO. AS I STATED I AM VERY AWARE OF THE GRANT. AND WRITING AND HOW INTENSIVE THAT CAN BE AND HOW MANY NEED. OF GRANT WRITING. HOW MUCH TIME IT TAKES REALLY AWAY FROM THE STUDENTS YOU'RE TRYING TO SERVE AND IT REALLY IS A FULL TIME JOB SO THANK YOU? OUT WILL GO AHEAD AND WITH GRANT. GOOD AFTERNOON BLAMES GRADUATED I'M NINETEEN YEARS OLD AND I TOOK TWO CLASSES THAT. S. B. C. T. OUR LOCAL SEATS YOU CAP IS JUNIOR AND SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL. AND LET ME START OFF BY SAYING. AND I'M. WILL BE VERY VERY. STRAIGHT FOR WITH YOU I WOULD NOT BE IN COLLEGE IF I DID NOT HAVE C. T. IN HIGH SCHOOL. THOUGHT INTO WHAT I WANTED TO DO BEFORE I STARTED GOING TO S. B. C. T. I HAD. NO PASSION FOR MATH OR ENGLISH. OR TO SET A DESK I LIKE TO MOVE AROUND WORK WITH PEOPLE. AND. IT REALLY GAVE ME A PLATFORM TO BUILD MYSELF AS A PERSON. I DEFINITELY HAVE THE COURAGE TO BE SITTING IN FRONT IN SITTING IN FRONT OF ALL OF YOU ARE TALKING RIGHT NOW. IF IT WASN'T FOR CT BECAUSE IT TAUGHT ME HOW TO HAVE BETTER COMMUNICATION SKILLS AND HOW TO WORK WITH PEOPLE. AND OF MY COMMUNICATION SKILLS DEFINITELY IMPROVED BECAUSE OF IT. AND MY A. IN MY. JOB AND IN MY LIFE. A CURLY WORKING AS IT. MEDICAL ASSISTANT AN URGENT CARE CLINIC. AND ALSO I'M GOING TO COLLEGE OUT TO BECOME AN EMT. WHICH GIVES ME THE PLATFORM TO GO TO SCHOOL TO BE A PARAMEDIC. I WANNA HAVE THE TENACITY TOWARDS EDUCATION AS COLLEGE STUDENT. IF I. GONNA HAVE A GOAL. AND MY. CAREER LIFE. HE WOULD SAY. MICHAEL IS TO BE A PART OF FIVE FIVE PARAMEDIC AND ALSO I WOULD LIKE TO BE A REGISTERED NURSE. SO WITHOUT. THE ABILITY TO HAVE THE HIGHER LEVEL EDUCATION THAT CT GAVE ME AND MAKE A HIGHER WAGE. OF I WANT TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD TO PAY FOR MY COLLEGE CLASSES. AND I DIDN'T WANNA HAVE PROBABLY WANTED TO GO TO COLLEGE TO BEGIN WITH. UNLESS I HAD A REASON TO AND I FEEL I HAVE A PASSION AND A REASON TO GO TO SCHOOL NOW. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO ME TO TRY TO SPEAK. NOT FOR MYSELF BUT FOR THE STUDENTS OF THE STATE. THOUGH INCOME. LOWER CLASS MIDDLE CLASS HIGH CLASS DOES IT REALLY MATTER WHERE YOU'RE FROM. I'M A FROM A SINGLE PARENT SINGLE INCOME HOUSEHOLD SO. I GUESS I SPEAK FOR MORE OF THE MIDDLE CLASS BUT I THINK IT'S IMPERATIVE TO EVERYBODY'S EDUCATION JOB OPPORTUNITY TO. TRY THINGS BECAUSE IF I DID HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TRY NEW THINGS I WANT TO BE SITTING HERE TALKING TO YOU TODAY. AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH GRANT. CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION THOUGH. YOUR GREAT JOB WHAT WERE THE TWO CLASSES THAT YOU TOOK AT THE CENTER AND HOW DID YOU LEARN ABOUT THE CENTER. I LEARNED ABOUT THE CENTER BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW THAT THERE EVEN WAS I WOULD I GUESS YOU'D SAY LOCATIONAL EDUCATION OUR. TRUE TECHNOLOGY CATION UNTIL I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL. I WAS NOT A STRAIGHT A STUDENT I WAS MORE OF LIKE A. HIGH BE ART LOW BE HIGH SEE STUDENTS SO I WASN'T THAT KID WHO IS GONNA GO STRAIGHT TO A FOUR YEAR. OR GONNA GO STRAIGHT TO TO YOU OUR NEW EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANTED TO MAJOR IN. ICE DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE A DECLARED MAJOR I'M LEANING MORE TOWARDS NURSING BUT I HEARD ABOUT IT THROUGH. WHAT OF MOUTH THROUGHOUT OLDER STUDENTS? I WAS. VERY SOCIAL AROUND THE SCHOOL AND I GOT TO KNOW A LOT OF THE OLDER STUDENTS AND THEY WERE TAKING WELDING THEY WERE TAKING. MACHINE THEY'RE TAKING AN AUTOMOTIVE THEY WERE TAKING HOLE WRENCH CLASSES ACTUALLY NO STUDENT WHO'S CURRENTLY ATTENDING SEAT AS WE SEE T. HE TOOK DIESEL MECHANICS AND NOW HE'S BACK FOR WELDING. MOVED OUT OF STATE CAME BACK YOU WANT CITY WELDING AND OF SOMEONE WHO'S IN A WELDING INDUSTRY BECAUSE HE TOOK WELDING AT AS VCT. I KNOW STUDENT FROM S. B. C. T. WHO IS NOW IN THE ARMY AND HE'S GOING TO JOIN NOT FORCE HIM WHEN HE GETS OUT ANOTHER STUDENT WHO TOOK FIRE SCIENCE AND IS NOW LAW ENFORCEMENT. SO. I STARTED IN THE FIRE SCIENCE COURSE BECAUSE I REALLY. THOUGHT THAT I WANTED TO JOIN THE FIRE DEPARTMENT BECAUSE I'M VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT HELPING AND SERVING PEOPLE. BUT ALSO. REALLY LIKE THE HIGH STANDARDS THAT THEY SET. AND ONCE I WAS DONE WITH THAT I WAS NOT ELIGIBLE TO TAKE EMT BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO BE EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD IN THE STATE CALIFORNIA TO DO THAT. SO I ASKED MY STRUCTURE OF WHAT SHOULD I DO NOW. HE SAID YOU SHOULD GO ACROSS THE HALL IT TAKE MEDICAL ASSISTING AND OTHER EXPANDER KNOWLEDGE IN THE MEDICAL WORLD. AND I CAN SAY THAT. IT STRONGLY HELP ME UNDERSTAND MERGED IN MEDICINE BETTER BY TAKING THAT SECOND COURSE. IT HELPED ME LEARN A LOT AND I KNOW THAT FOR A FACT IT'S GIVE ME AN ADVANTAGE OVER OTHER STUDENTS. BECAUSE. IF YOU LOOK IN MY RESUME HAVE DONE SO MANY THINGS THAT I WOULD HAVE NEVER DONE WITHOUT THIS PROGRAM SO. I TOOK FIRE SITE TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AND I TOOK. OUR MEDICAL SYSTEM TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THOUSAND SIXTEEN. WELL WE'RE VERY PROUD OF YOU AND I KNOW THAT. YOUR SUPERINTENDENT IS AND AND I SAY I THINK YOUR TESTIMONY REALLY. EXPRESSES WHAT. I MANY OF US. FEEL THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE WITH PUBLIC EDUCATION THAT. NOT THAT WE TRACK STUDENTS BUT THAT WE HAVE OF CHOICES FOR STUDENTS SO CONGRATULATIONS YOU'VE DONE A GREAT JOB. ANYBODY ELSE WANT TO SAY ANYTHING TO GRANT. OKAY SO THEY WILL GO THROUGH TO THE NEXT SPEAKER AND I KNOW YOUR TIME IS SHORT SO I'LL BE QUICK BUT. BUT THE PASSION THAT YOU JUST HEARD FROM OUR SUPERINTENDENT AND OUR STUDENTS AND. AND GRANT IS SO IMPRESSIVE. AT NOTICE HOW THEY'RE SPEAKING FROM THE HEART. AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY SIGNIFICANT. WE ARE A JP A. WE HAVE SIX SCHOOL DISTRICTS I'M SANTA CLARA UNIFIED TO THAT'S DISTRICT THAT I REPRESENT ON OUR METRIC CAMPUS. AND AWE I HAD TREMENDOUS PASSION FOR ALL WE TO YOUR I'VE BEEN A SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER FOR MANY YEARS. TIME AND THAT I YOU KNOW IN EDUCATION AND K. THROUGH TWELVE DISTRICT. IT CAN TAKE YEARS TO SEE THE FRUITS HERE LAYERS WHATEVER MIGHT BE A BOND BUILDING NEW SCHOOLS NEW PROGRAMS. AND CT WHICH IS SYMMETRIC CAMPUS WE HAVE STUDENTS MANY STUDENTS JUST LIKE GRANT THAT EVERY ONE OF OUR MEETINGS WHO COME OUT AND SPEAK WITH PASSION. AND WHEN YOU SEE HOW THEY FIND THAT NICHE WHEN USED THEY FIND THAT TRACK. AND I WANTED TO SPEAK TO SOMETHING THAT WAS SAID EARLIER LIKE THERE'S THESE TWO TRACKS COLLEGE AND CAREER NO THERE'S NOT AYE I I HAVE TO SAY THIS NINETEEN SEVENTIES EIGHTIES THINKING. THAT'S NOT TWENTY FIRST CENTURY THINKING WHERE IN THE SILICON VALLEY WE SEE STUDENTS LIKE GRANT WHO CUTS ARE CAMPUS FINE IN H. FIND A PASSION. MAKE A FANTASTIC INCOME AND THEN GO ON THE COLLEGE AND CONTINUE AND FOR THOSE STUDENTS WHO ARE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BE FROM AFFLUENT FAMILY. WERE RESOURCES ON AN ISSUE AND SILICON VALLEY WE HAVE A LOT OF THOSE STUDENTS AT HOME WITH MOM AND DAD WITH SHANINA DEGREES ARE NOT GETTING TRACTION BECAUSE IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE TO LIVE IN SILICON VALLEY. OUR STUDENTS ARE VERY MOTIVATED THEY COME AND THEY FIND THEIR NICHE THEY THEY ARE SUCCESSFUL THEY MAKE SIGNIFICANT INCOMES IN SOME CASES A STAND ACCURATE TRACK. AND SOME CASES AGO ON THE COLLEGE INFO IN GOING TO NEW CHAPTERS IN THEIR LIFE. SOME START THEIR OWN BUSINESSES WE HAVE A FORMER STUDENT WHO IS NOW GETTING RECOGNITION IN THE FILM INDUSTRY HE WHAT THROUGH OUR CAMPUS AND HE STARTED AN INCREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL COMPANY. WE HAVE. GOSH THERE'S JUST SO MANY EXAMPLES WE COULD FILL THIS CHAMBER WAS STUDENTS I FIGURE ONCE YOU KNOW WE HAVE WHO. SHE NOW WORKS AT TASKS LA AND IN FREMONT IN THE SILICON VALLEY AND SHE'S ON THE ASSEMBLY LINE AND SHE'S VERY PROUD OF ALL THE TECHNOLOGY INVOLVED IN INSTALLING THE REAR HATCH ON TESLA SO DANCE. THIS IS A NEW TIME THIS IS A NEW AGE THIS IS A TWENTY FIRST CENTURY WE JUST CELEBRATED OUR CENTENNIAL LAST YEAR. SAN JOSE IS HAS HE T. E. SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTEEN AND I'M TELLING YOU RIGHT NOW FROM THE HEART AS A GOVERNING BOARD MEMBER OF THE K. THROUGH TWELVE DISTRICT AND AS A REPRESENTATIVE ON THIS JPA MATCHER AT BOARD. IF WE DON'T RESTORED DIRECT FUNDING WE WON'T BE AROUND ANOTHER HUNDRED YEARS I PROMISE YOU THAT WE NEED TO AND THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S A MATTER ARE RESTORATION WE LOST A DIRECT FUNDING FOR YEARS AGO. IT NEEDS TO BE RESTORED LAST POINT WE SUE SOMEBODY LIKE GRANT AND HIS SUCCESS IN HIS LIFE. WHATEVER DOLLARS GO INTO THIS I ASSURE YOU MANY MANY MANY TIMES TO THE THOSE DOLLARS COME BACK AND THE IN THE INCOME THAT HE MAKES IN THE TAXES THAT HE PAYS. THE BUSINESSES HE MAY START THE PEOPLE HE MAY HIGHER I DON'T CARE IF SOMEONE MENTIONED EARLIER TODAY I DON'T HE MAY BE GONE NOW BUT HE TALKED ABOUT THIS IS NOT A PARTISAN ISSUE THIS IS NOT A PARTISAN ISSUE. OUR LOYALTY HERE IS THE STUDENTS OF CALIFORNIA R. LOYALTY IS TO OUR STATE AND THE SUCCESS OF OUR PEOPLE AND OUR KIDS. I'M PASSIONATE. EVERYONE HEARS PASSIONATE AND WE NEED TO RESTORE DIRECT AND ONGOING FUNDING NOTHING LESS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA. THANK YOU CHAIR A I'D IS ONE OF FOR SMALL. GRANT THANK YOU SO MUCH I DO YOU ARTICULATE THE IMPORTANCE OF CT IN A WAY. THAT FEW CAN I'M INTO AS A STUDENT HAS ACTUALLY EXPERIENCED AND SO A YEAR PHENOMENAL JOB AND I THINK ALL THREE OF YOU FOR BEING HERE IN PARTICULAR. THAT OUR SUPERINTENDENT I THINK THAT THAT A MOTION. REALLY SPEAKS I BELIEVE TWO OF THE PASSION THAT SO MANY DO YOU HAVE FOR THE STUDENTS. THAT ARE GOING TO OUR CITY PROGRAMS THAT IS ONE OF. AYE AYES WANNA MAKE COMMENTS TO. YOU KNOW BACKING UP BOTH BUT THE SUPERINTENDENT AS WELL AS OUR BOARD MEMBER HERE MISTER CANOVA INDICATED. BECAUSE. I THINK THAT IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN CT IS AS RELEVANT TODAY AS PROBABLY IT'S EVER BEEN. BECAUSE OF THE CHANGING NATURE OF OUR WORK FORCE IN OUR ECONOMY. AND I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S AN EITHER OR BETWEEN CAREER IN COLLEGE I THINK IT'S ACTUALLY THE EXACT SAME THING. OF AND WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT MATH SCIENCE AND READING. THOSE THAT ARE GOING TO SEE T. E. WHILE THEY'RE IN HIGH SCHOOL WHEN THEY. ARE GRADUALLY MY HIGH SCHOOL THE WAY THAT THEY'RE LEARNING THEIR MATH SCIENCE AND READING THAT THEY'RE MORE PREPARED AND THE WORKFORCE THAN THOSE ARE. THAT ARE FOCUS ONLY ON TRYING INTO COLLEGE. AND WE KNOW HOW VALUABLE THAT IS BECAUSE AS WAS INDICATED. IT IS SAN JOSE SOUNDS A MEASURE OF HIS MOST EXPENSIVE PLACE IN THE COUNTRY. WHEN IT COMES TO RATS WHEN IT COMES TO REAL ESTATE. AND IT'S AN INCREDIBLY COMPETITIVE WORK WORLD WORK MARKER ECONOMIC I'M A JOB MARKET. AND SO IT'S I THINK. IT'S REALLY NOT REALISTIC IN NOR IS IT COMPASSIONATE OR SMART FOR US. CCTV IS IN SOME WAY COMPETING WITH ANY KIND OF EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM A PRANK POST COLLEGE BECAUSE THE REALITY IS THAT. PEOPLE NEED TO GO TO WORK. PAIN TO BUILD A FOUR TO LIVE IN CALIFORNIA. AND THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT COLLEGE IS NOT IN THEIR FUTURE AND YOU KNOW IN SOME CASES IT WON'T BE BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE A GREAT JOB STRAIGHT OUT OF. HIGH SCHOOL THAT WILL BECOME THEIR CAREER BUT THEY HAVE AND AND AND I APPRECIATE OF. DECEMBER QUIRK SILVA SINGS CHOICES BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT IT'S ABOUT WE WANT TO GIVE ALL OF US USE THE CHOICES. THAT ATTRACT THEM AND WE HEARD IT FROM A GRANT THAT CT  <u><c.green>IS WHAT LED HIM TO</c></u> HIS PASSION. AND FOR SOMEONE ELSE MAYBE IT WILL BE SOMETHING DOZEN AG FROM COLLEGE TRACK THAT'S. FINE BUT I THINK THAT WE NEED TO STOP THINKING ABOUT. CT AS A SUBSTITUTE BUT TO BASIC EDUCATION. OTHER REALITY IS THAT SEEKS YOU SHOULD NEVER BE CONSIDERED A SUBSIDIARY. TYPE OF EDUCATION IT YOU'RE REALLY A NEEDS TO BE CONSIDERED AS AN EQUAL OTHER TO TO GOING TO COLLEGE. BECAUSE AND MAY END UP ON THAT PATH AND MAY NOT WITH THE KIND OF QUALITY EDUCATE AND I'VE BEEN IN THE METRO ED. BECAUSE WE TALK ABOUT SORT BY CITY I WENT EASE I UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATE WHICH IS PART OF THAT THE JPA. AND NATURAL ED IS A FIVE MINUTE DRIVE MY HOME I'VE BEEN THERE MANY TIMES AND. I WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE YOU KNOW MANY THE MEMBERS ARE HERE NOW WE HAVE THE OBVIOUS HAVE ALLOWED FOR MEETINGS OF COMMITTEES TO GO TO. BUT I WOULD ENCOURAGE THEM IF THEY HAVEN'T VISITED. A A CT ESPECIALLY ARE A RESULT OF CENTER TO COME TO SETTLE THE INCOME TO METRO EDITOR GO TO ONE THAT'S NEAR THEM. IF THEY HAVEN'T BEEN TO ONE THEY DON'T THEY THEY WILL NOT UNDERSTAND THE VALUE OF THE KIND OF TRAINING THAT HAPPENS ON THESE CAMPUSES I'VE SEEN IT ALL FROM THE FIRE NURSES ASSISTANT STEP. TO BUILDING TRADES TYPE WORK AYE TO SOLAR PANEL INSTALLATION AND ON AND ON AND ON AND THEY'RE LEARNING THE BASIC SKILLS. THAT OTHER STUDENTS ARE LEARNING IN A HANDS ON MANNER UNLIKE ANYWHERE ELSE SO. I'M I'M FULLY SUPPORTIVE RCTS I AND I AGREE THAT WE MUST DO WHATEVER WE CAN TO GET TO A PLACE OF PERMANENT FUNDING. AND UP BECAUSE TO HAVE TO KEEP ON FIGHTING I MEAN IT'S SO HARD AS WE ALL KNOW DICK TO KEEP THE ADMINISTRATION RUNNING WHEN YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUR NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET GOING TO BE. OR EVEN YOUR FIVE YEAR OUT. WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO PREPARE IN THIS CASE IN UP FIFTEEN HUNDRED HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS GOING THROUGH SILICON VALLEY ICICI <u><c.green>.</c></u> THAT'S LARGER THAN MOST HIGH SCHOOLS AND IN THE STATE AND SO. BUT MUCH MORE COMPLICATED BECAUSE YOU HAVE FOLKS COMING FROM SO MANY DIFFERENT SCHOOLS SO ANYWAY I'M A BIG FAN OF HIS BLOOD TO SPECIFICALLY A METRO EN THE SLOCUM AYE. CG PROGRAM BUT A CITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND AND I'M VERY HAPPY WITH HAVING THIS CONVERSATION BECAUSE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE. THAT AS WE LOOK AT WHETHER IT'S RETOOLING THE PROCESS IN WHICH MONEY COMES DOWN FOR THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT WERE DOING IT WITH OUR EYES WIDE OPEN AND WE'RE DOING IT. LISTENING TO THOSE ARE ACTUALLY THE PRACTITIONERS THAT ARE SERVING OUR STUDENTS EVERY SINGLE DAY SO THAT WE'RE NOT MAKING THINGS MORE COMPLICATED UNNECESSARILY BUT WERE ACTUALLY GETTING THE MONEY. A AND THE RESOURCES AND THE. TO THOSE GRANT GREAT JOB AYE I WOULD DEFINITELY SAY TO THOSE WHO ARE LISTENING TO GO OUT AND VISIT SOME OF THE C. T. E. PROGRAMS AS I STARTED ARE MY COMMENTS WHEN WE WERE OUT IN BUENA PARK. AND OF COURSE THE STUDENTS AND THE TEACHERS KNEW WERE COMING SO. BUT THEY WERE NOT PROMPTED TO TELL US THE THINGS THAT THEY WOULD JUST QUIETLY TALUS IN SO MANY OF THEM TO. TOLD US THEY WOULD NOT BE COMING TO SCHOOL HAD THEY NOT BEEN AND SOME OF THE PROGRAMS BUT ONE PARTICULAR IS AND AGAIN. WHAT A PARK WHICH SOME PEOPLE WITH AND WHY DO YOU NEED AN AGRICULTURE PROGRAM AND? WARRANT NORTH ORANGE COUNTY BUT. YOU KNOW MANY WAYS ISN'T THAT OUTDATED BUT THEY TO THEY SHOWED US AND TOLD US ABOUT NOT ONLY WHAT THEY'RE GROWING BUT OF COURSE GOING TO THE COUNTY FARM. BUT THAT THEY'RE SELLING LITERALLY RIGHT NOW YOU CAN GO ON TO THEIR WEBSITE AND THEY ARE SELLING ON NOT ONLY EGGS THAT YOU CAN BUY A. EVERYDAY BUT THEY'RE DOING FLORAL ARRANGEMENTS THAT YOU CAN PURCHASE FOR EVENTS ALL OF THESE THINGS. THAT ARE A PART OF OUR ECONOMY AND WHAT BETTER WAY AS WE SAY TO LEARN THAN THEM ACTUALLY BECOMING THESE YOUNG ENTREPRENEURS SO. THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU. WE CAN START WITH FROM THE REST.

FRESNO UNIFIED SERVES MORE THAN SEVENTY FOUR THOUSAND STUDENTS FROM PRESCHOOL THROUGH GRADE TWELVE. IT IS PREPARING CAREER READY GRADUATES THROUGH HIGH QUALITY INSTRUCTION. DISTRICT PROGRAMS AND SERVICES AND RESOURCES. WE SIXTY SIX ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS FIFTEEN MIDDLE SCHOOLS NINE HIGH SCHOOLS FOR ALTERED SCHOOLS THREE SPECIAL EDUCATION SCHOOLS AND CHARTER SCHOOLS. WE ALSO HAVE AN ADULT SCHOOL THE FIRST MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND ADULTS IN OUR COMMUNITY. WITH ACADEMIC AND CAREER PREPARATION PROGRAMS. OR BOARD DEVELOPED AN OVER ARCHING MISSION. AND THE LINE DISTRICT GOALS THAT TO TEASE SICKLY GUIDE OUR WORK THE MISSION IN OUR DISTRICT GOALS CONDUCT EXTREMELY WELL TO THE REAL WORLD. OUR MISSION AS A DISTRICTS IS PREPARING CAREER READY GRADUATES. THE GOAL THAT SUPPORT THE MISSION. ARE THAT ALL STUDENTS WILL EXCEL IN READING WRITING AND MATH. ALL STUDENTS WILL ENGAGE IN ARTISTIC ACTIVITIES AT ATHLETICS. ALL STUDENTS WILL DEMONSTRATE THE CHARACTER AND COMPETENCIES FOR WORKPLACE EXPRESSED. BUT ALL STUDENTS WILL STAY IN SCHOOL ON TARGET TO GRADUATE. THE REALLY IMPORTANT THING TO KNOW. IS THAT IS NOT ENOUGH. WE ARE NOT IMPACTING ENOUGH KIDS. WE KNOW WHAT THE RESEARCH INDICATES THAT WE HAVE SEEN WHAT IT SUGGESTS FIRST HAND IN OUR OWN SCHOOLS. KIDS WHO HAVE EXPOSURE TO APPLIED LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES. KIDS WHO UNDERSTAND THE RELEVANCE OF WHAT THEY ARE LEARNING. THE KIDS TO LEARN ABOUT POTENTIAL CAREER OPTIONS. THOSE ARE THE KIDS WHO BECOME TRULY ENGAGED IN SCHOOL. THEY'RE THE ONES THAT STAY IN SCHOOL AND GRADUATE. AND THEY ARE THE ONES WHO WORK SUCCESSFUL IN THE REAL WORLD. THE LEADERSHIP OF FRESNO UNIFIED OR BOARD IN OUR SUPERINTENDENT UNDERSTAND TO A LARGE DEGREE. THE PROSPERITY OF OUR COMMUNITY REST IN THE ABILITY OF FRESNO UNIFIED THE LARGEST SCHOOL DISTRICT IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. TO GRADUATE STUDENTS WITH A CHARACTER AND COMPETENCY FOR WORKPLACE SUCCESS. OUR BOARD ADOPTED A CAREER READY DEFINITION. THAT ALL STUDENTS WILL HAVE POSSIBLE OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO THEM UPON GRADUATION FROM FRESNO UNIFIED. THIS STUDENT HOUSE A STRONG ACADEMIC FOUNDATION. HAS COMPLETED REQUIRED COURSES. YEAH HOUSE ACQUIRED THE WORKPLACE SKILLS AND COMPETENCIES NECESSARY FOR SUCCESS AFTER HIGH SCHOOL. WE HAVE A GUIDING PRINCIPLE THAT LEAVES OUR WORK. SO HOW DO WE PREPARE COLLEGE AND CAREER READY GRADUATES AND FRESNO UNIFIED FOR THE WIDEST ARRAY OF OPTIONS. WE'VE ADOPTED A DIFFERENT GRADUATE PROFILE FURTHER DETAIL AND THE SKILLS AND COMPETENCIES FOR WORKPLACE SUCCESS. COLLABORATION TEAMWORK COMMUNICATION DIGITAL LITERACY. WE HAVE A COLLEGE AND CAREER CONTINUUM THE DETAILS GRADE LEVEL WORK FOR ALL. STUDENTS. IN THE THIRD GRADE WE BRING BUSINESSES TO EVERY THIRD GRADE CLASSROOM. EVERY CAMPUS TO EXPOSE STUDENTS TO STEM CAREERS. BY DOING HANDS ON ACTIVITIES WITH THEM. DURING OF ACTIVITY STUDENTS ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT JOBS AND TOOLS. AND SPEAKERS INTENTIONALLY TALK ABOUT CAREER COMPETENCIES LIKE TEAMWORK AND COLLABORATION. IN THE FOURTH GRADE STUDENTS LEAVE CAMPUS AND VISIT LOCAL BUSINESSES TO SEE REAL PLACES OF WORK. WE WANT STUDENTS TO BEGIN TO SEE THEMSELVES IN A WORK ENVIRONMENT AND THINK ABOUT WHAT THEY LIKE. HOW SCHOOLS CONDUCT TO WORKPLACE EXPRESS? AND SEE FIRST HAND SOME OF THE SKILLS THEY WILL NEED TO BE SUCCESSFUL AT WORK. IN FIFTH GRADE WE HAVE PARTNERED WITH FRESNO STATE AND DEVELOPED A STEM BASED CURRICULUM A LINE TO THE NEXT GENERATION FIVE STANDARDS. THAT HIGHLIGHTS CREATIVITY AND INNOVATION. SENATE SIX GRADE STUDENTS VISIT ONE OF OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE. SO THAT STUDENTS BETTER UNDERSTAND THEIR OPTIONS AFTER GRADUATION. BUT THE MIDDLE SCHOOL LEVEL WE FOCUS ON CAREER EXPLORATION AND CONNECTING WITH COUNSELING. WE WANT HELP STUDENTS THINK MORE DELIBERATELY ABOUT CAREER OPTIONS AND DEEPEN THEIR KNOWLEDGE ABOUT CAREER CHOICES. ADDITIONALLY WE PROVIDE COLLEGE TOURS THAT INTENTIONALLY CONDUCT THEIR CAREER INTERESTS. WITH COLLEGE MAJORS. IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN FIFTEEN WE LOTS LIKE LEARNING PATHWAYS ACROSS ALL OF OUR COMPREHENSIVE HIGH SCHOOLS. LINK LEARNING AS AN INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGY THAT A COMPASSES FOR CORE PRINCIPLES. COHORT SCHEDULING. RIGOROUS ACADEMIC AND CT COURSEWORK. AND STUDENT SUPPORT SO THAT BOTH TEACHERS AND STUDENTS WITHIN THE PATHWAY. CREATE OPPORTUNITIES TO COLLABORATE WITH IN A RIGOROUS AND RELEVANT CAREER THEMES. PATHWAYS INCORPORATE WORK BASED LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES TEACH TECHNICAL AND TRANSFERABLE SKILLS. AND EMBEDDED INDUSTRY CERTIFICATIONS TO DATE WE HAVE TWENTY FIVE LIKE LEARNING PATHWAYS. THAT ENGAGE STUDENTS IN A WIDE VARIETY OF CAREER THINGS FROM EGO TECHNOLOGY. TO EDUCATION TO ENGINEERING AND CONSTRUCTION. WE JUST BROKE GROUND ON A NEW FACILITY. ESTABLISHING A LARGE TRUCK MAINTENANCE REPAIR TRAINING FACILITY. A FACILITY WE BELIEVE SUPPORTS OUR LOCAL INDUSTRY. AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE WORK WITH OUR INDUSTRY PARTNERS INACTIVITY PREPARE STUDENTS TO FILL HIGH DEMAND. OR NEW AND EMERGING POSITIONS WITHIN OUR LOCAL WORKFORCE. WE CONTINUE TO PARTNER WITH OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN EXPAND TO A NON ROMAN OFFER TO ME TO USE. THIS SCHOOL YEAR WE HAVE OVER FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE STUDENTS EARNING COLLEGE CREDIT WHILE THEY'RE IN HIGH SCHOOL. DUAL ENROLLMENT ALLOW STUDENTS TO EARN COLLEGE CREDITS WERE GOING TO HIGH SCHOOL THEY ARE TAKEN CLASSES ARE TAKEN RIGHT ON THE STUDENTS HIGH SCHOOL CAMPUS. WITH NO OUT OF POCKET EXPENSES. FRESNO UNIFIED BELIEVE THAT LEARNING IS A CONTINUING PROCESS OF ENGAGING OUR STUDENTS. PARENTS AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. TO THIS END WE UTILIZE CAREER INTEREST SOFTWARE IN OUR AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS. AND ARE COMMITTED TO ENRICHMENT OPPORTUNITIES IN THE SOME ALL SUMMER. FOR EXAMPLE OUR SPORTS SCIENCE INSTITUTE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH FRESNO STATE. IS A WEEK LONG CAMP FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS THAT FOCUSES ON KINESIOLOGY AND SPORTS MEDICINE.

OUR WORK IS FOCUSED ON PROVIDING THE WIDEST ARRAY OF OPTIONS FOR ALL STUDENTS. OUR DATA DASHBOARD MONITORS SPECIFIC WORKS SUCH AS THE NUMBER OF CT A THROUGH G. COURSES OFFERED IN THE DISTRICT. EIGHTY FOUR PERCENT OF RCT COURSES ARE A THROUGH G. APPROVED. AS CT OPPORTUNITIES HAVE EXPANDED THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS ON TRACK FOR A THIRD YEAR HE HAS ALSO INCREASED. AND IMPROVE DEEP A THROUGH G. RATES RATES DIRECTLY CORRELATE TO INCREASED COLLEGE APPLICATIONS. WE DILIGENTLY WORK TOGETHER. TO CREATE COLLEGE AND CAREER READY GRADUATES. THE CHALLENGES PRESENTED IN THIS WORK. ARE MANY. THEY INCLUDE FINDING HIGH QUALITY CT TEACHERS. PROFESSIONAL LEARNING TO UPGRADE CURRENT TEACHER SKILLS AND CONTINUING THEIR INDUSTRY RELEVANCE. FACILITIES AND ONGOING COST FOR CT PROGRAMS AND FUNDING. CATEGORICAL FUNDING THAT IS OFTEN RESTRICTIVE TO ONLY MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS. WE HAVE BEEN RECIPIENTS OF VARIOUS FUNDING. FRESNO UNIFIED IS COMMITTED TO DEVELOPING A STRONG CT PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES THE WIDEST ARRAY OF OPTIONS. CT HE IS NOT JUST ABOUT HIGH SCHOOL. WE NEED TO PROVIDE CAREER CAREER AWARENESS AND TECHNICAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS AT EARLIER AGES. WE KNOW THAT ALL STUDENTS NEED EXPOSURE TO THE WORLD OF WORK. WE NEED AGE APPROPRIATE CAREER AWARENESS AND EXPLORATION FOR ALL KIDS. EVEN OUR ELEMENTARY STUDENTS. WE KNOW THAT STUDENTS NEED TO DEMONSTRATE WORKPLACE SKILLS AND COMPETENCIES LIKE PROBLEM SOLVING AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS. AND WE NEED TO DETERMINE THE BEST WAY TO EMBED THAT SKILL DEVELOPMENT WITHIN OUR CURRICULUM. WE NO THERE NEEDS TO BE A COHERENT SYSTEM OF COURAGE OCCASIONAL. ACROSS THE DISTRICT SO THAT ALL STUDENTS AND PARENTS UNDERSTAND ALL THEIR OPTIONS. IT ARE SUPPORTED BY STAFF AS THEY NAVIGATE THE SYSTEM. WE KNOW THAT THE TWO U. COURSES. AND PATHWAYS NEED TO BE ACADEMICALLY RIGOROUS. SO ALL OF OUR STUDENTS HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO GET GOOD JOBS OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL. AND GO TO COLLEGE. TO HAVE THE CHOICE. TO MAKE. AND FINALLY MOST IMPORTANTLY WE KNOW WE CAN'T DO THIS. NOR SHOULD WE DO THIS ON OUR OWN. WE NEED TO REACH OUT TO INDUSTRY. TO LABOR. TWO PARENTS. TO THE FED EX LOST SECTOR TO GOVERNMENT AND OUR HIGHER EDUCATION PARTNERS. WE NEED TO DEVELOP MEANINGFUL PARTNERSHIPS. WHERE WE ALL WORK TOGETHER? TO HELP OUR KIDS. STAY IN SCHOOL. GET JOBS AND BE SUCCESS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF CT PROGRAMS. WELL GOOD AFTERNOON BUT WHAT WHAT THE ONE ONE MOMENT THEN I'M SMIS PRICE THAT ONE QUICK QUESTIONS TO ASK.

HAVE THE FIRST ONE. IS. THAT MOST KIDS ARE NOT ALL KIDS ARE GOING TO PURSUE A FOUR YEAR DEGREE. WE KNOW THAT. SO MANY CAREER CAREER EDUCATION HIGH SCHOOL THAT IS BOTH ENGAGING. AND THAT WILL INSPIRE FURTHER EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT. BUT ALSO TRAINING OF POST HIGH SCHOOL. IT'S NOT EITHER OR COLLEGE OR CAREER A CHOICE IT'S RATHER ABOUT A MAKING OF MAXIMIZING CHOICES FOR ALL STUDENTS. SECOND THE MIDDLE SKILL JOBS MAKE UP THE LARGEST SEGMENT OF CALIFORNIA'S LABOR MARKET ROUGHLY ROUGHLY HALF OF CALIFORNIA'S LABOR MARKET. MIDDLE SKILL IS DEFINED AS REQUIRING. EDUCATION TRAINING BEYOND HIGH SCHOOL. BUT ON A FOUR YEAR COLLEGE DEGREE. BUT ANTHONY CARNAVAL THE FROM GEORGETOWN ESTIMATES THAT NEARLY HALF OF THE FOLKS WHO ARE CURRENTLY IN GOOD JOBS IN CALIFORNIA MEANING A MEDIAN. ANNUAL INCOME OF FIFTY NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR ARE MIDDLE SKILL. THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT PROJECTS THAT NEARLY ONE MILLION JOB OPENINGS OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS ARE MIDDLE SKILL. IN THE POINT THAT I'M TRYING MAKE IS NOT ONLY WILL NOT ALL HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES GO TO COLLEGE IMMEDIATELY GO TO COLLEGE AFTER HIGH SCHOOL. WILL NOT. PURSUE A FOUR YEAR DEGREE NOT ALL JOBS REQUIRE A FOUR YEAR DEGREE BUT ALL GOOD JOBS DO REQUIRE EDUCATION OR TRAINING AFTER HIGH SCHOOL. FINALLY. CAREER EDUCATION IN HIGH SCHOOL. SHOULD LINE UP. VERY DIRECTLY WITH WHAT'S HAPPENING IN IN REGIONAL LABOR MARKETS. WORK FOR SPORTS COMMITTEE COLLEGES AROUND SHE TO WORKING TOGETHER REGIONAL PLANS. THAT IDENTIFY INDUSTRY SECTORS THAT ARE DRIVING REGIONAL EMPLOYMENT IN OCCUPATIONS. IN THOSE SECTORS WITH MOST PROJECTED OPENINGS. THERE ARE LINING CREW DUCATION IN TRAINING WITH COMPANIES IN THOSE SECTORS. OF THEIR COKE DESIGNING CURRICULUM WITH EMPLOYERS. SO HIGH SCHOOL CAREER EDUCATION SHOULD LINE. UP AS WELL SO THAT STUDENTS CAN EXPLORE CAREER PATHWAYS TAKE ADVANTAGE OF WORK BASED LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE POPPING UP ALL OVER THE STATE. AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ACCESSIBLE AFFORDABLE A EDUCATION TRAINING POST HIGH SCHOOL. THIS IS GOOD WORKFORCE POLICY IS GOOD EDUCATION POLICY BUT IT'S ALSO GOOD ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT POLICY. AYE IF FOR SUPPORTING A COMPANIES IN INDUSTRY SECTORS ARE DRIVING REGIONAL PLAMEN ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BY CREATING A GOOD QUALITY. LOVE LABOR POOLS AROUND THE STATE WE'RE GONNA HELP THOSE SECTORS GROVER GONNA HELP. THEM CREATE MORE JOBS IN THIS CAN BE A GREAT BENEFIT FOR THAT THE ENTIRE STATE. I'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT BECAUSE I KNOW THERE'S A GREAT PANEL COMING UP NEXT RICK NICOLE WRITES IN JEREMY SMITH THEY'RE.

SO MY NAME IS GOING TO HAVE YOU SIGN EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT FOR NATIONAL AYE BROWN'S COMPANY. ON THE STATE TREASURER ALSO FOR CALIFORNIA SHE MIDDLE CONTRACTORS ASSOCIATION. I WANNA THANK YOU EACH OF YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO BE HERE TODAY. AND LET ME SET ARE BY SAYING THAT VOCATIONAL EDUCATION HAD EARLY IN PROFOUND IMPACT. ON ME. MY DOES EXCESS MY LIGHT NAM OPPORTUNITIES. THIS IS TRUE FOR ME AND ALL MY PEERS IN CALIFORNIA'S ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRIES. I'M LITERALLY HERE TODAY AS A PRODUCT THE PUBLIC INVESTMENT IN VOCATIONAL EDUCATION IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES AND NINETEEN SEVENTIES. I IT IN SCHOOL I WAS NOT INTERESTED IN TRADITIONAL CLASSES AND DID JUST WHAT WAS NECESSARY TO PASS THEM. I WAS HOWEVER EXCITED TO ATTEND SHOP CLASS AND BUILD SOMETHING AND SEE THE POSITIVE RESULTS. WELL IN HIGH SCHOOL I WAS EXPOSED TO WORK EXPERIENCE OPPORTUNITY. DURING THIS SESSION I WAS REQUIRED TO READ VARIOUS ARTICLES ON CAREER TECHNICAL JOB OPPORTUNITIES AND WRITE A BRIEF REPORT. ONE CAREER OPPORTUNITY H. PAC HAD ME VERY INTRIGUED. THE CREW REQUIRED ELECTRICAL WELDING SHEET METAL AND OTHER SKILLS. IT ALSO PAID EXTREMELY WELL I BELIEVE. IN LOOKING AT A PATH TO ENTER THE TRADE I FOUND I COULD ATTEND LANEY COLLEGE IN OAKLAND CALIFORNIA. LAINEY OFFERED A TWO YEAR CERTIFICATION PROGRAM ORNISH SOCIAL SCIENCE DEGREE. I TOOK THE CERTIFICATION PATH EXECUTIVE BOARD CLASSIFIED SO WANTED TO SKIP IN HIGH SCHOOL. AFTER TWO YEARS AT LANEY. COLLEGE I WAS ABLE SECURE AN APPRENTICESHIP WITH A SHEET METAL WORKERS UNION. IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN I BEGAN MY CAREER AT NATIONAL OR BALLOTS COMPANY. AND ONLY EIGHT SHORT YEARS LATER I BECAME A PARTNER IN THE FIRM. AFTER SPENDING TEN YEARS IN THE FIELD I BEGIN HAVE MORE INVOLVEMENT IN THE BUSINESS SIDE OF THINGS. IT WAS THEN THAT I WENT BACK TO SCHOOL TO TAKE CONTINUING EDUCATION CLASS WORK NECESSARY. TO DEVELOP A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE FINANCIAL SID THE BUSINESS WAS OPERATED. WITH MY VOCATIONAL INTERESTS AND LIFE EXPERIENCE THAT LED ME TO DEVELOP THE DESIRE TO RETURN AN ACTUAL LEARNED IN THE TYPICAL ACADEMIC CLASSROOM SETTING. THIS UNFORTUNATE IN MY OPINION HE'S IMPORTANT VOCATIONAL PATHWAYS TO BOTH LIFE AND POST SECONDARY EDUCATION ARE NO LONGER ENCOURAGED IN THE CALL COLLEGE ONLY PATHWAYS. OF TODAY'S HIGH SCHOOLS. IN FACT SEE TI E. AS IMPORTANT TO TO PAY TWELVE STUDENTS IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AS THE ADVANCED PLACEMENT PLACEMENT CLASSES ARE TO STUDENTS WERE GOING TO TAKE WAS CONSIDERED THE TRADITIONAL. YOU SEE CSU COLLEGE ADMISSION ROUTE AFTER HIGH SCHOOL. IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN I WAS FORTUNATE TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE ON A PANEL THAT WAS INTERVIEWING POTENTIAL CANDIDATES FOR THE UNION SHEET METAL PRISON PROGRAM. IN THE BAY AREA. THERE WERE MULTIPLE CANDIDATES WHO ARE ACTUALLY GRADUATES FROM TRADITIONAL FOUR YEAR COLLEGES. I WAS INTERESTED TO LISTEN TO THEIR REASONS FOR WANTING TO HAVE A CAREER PATH IN THE CONSTRUCTION TRADE AFTER SPENDING NEARLY ALL THEIR LIVES ON ACADEMIC ONLY PATHWAY. THE REASONS THEY CITED RANGE FROM PAY AND BENEFITS TO THE WORK HOURS AND THE QUALITY OF LIFE. OUR FIRM NOW CO HIRED FOR THE YOUNG MAN AND I AM HAPPY TO SAY THERE ARE DOING WELL. ALTHOUGH THEY NOW MUST COMPLETE A FIVE YEAR PARTNERSHIP. PROGRAM AND PAY BACK YOUR UC AND CSU LOANS. HAVE YOU BEEN EXPOSED TO CREEK TECHNICAL EDUCATION K. TWELVE THEY MAY HAVE BEEN YEARS AHEAD AND FREE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN STUDENT LOANS. IT SADDENS ME AND MY PEERS THAT THE CURRENT CULTURE AND OUR STATE DOES NOT PUT THE SAME EMPHASIS AND FUNDING TOWARDS VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AS THEY DO FOR COLLEGE PREP COURSE WORK IN MIDDLE SCHOOLS AND HIGH SCHOOLS. THIS ISN'T EMBLEMATIC OF A DANGEROUS CLASS CASTE SYSTEM THAT PERPETUATES THE FALSE NOTIONS THAT PEOPLE WHO PURSUE ONLY ACADEMIC GOALS. ARE SMARTER THAN. MORE SUCCESSFUL THEN. AND MORE IMPORTANT. THEN THOSE WHO CHOOSE TO WORK WITH THEIR HANDS. IN FACT THIS DAHLE TELLS THE MAJORITY OF OUR CHILDREN THE LESS THEY PURSUE ADMISSIONS TO OUR UC AND CSU SYSTEMS. THAT THEY ARE NOT A PRIORITY. THIS IS WRONG. WOULD LIKE TO THANK CHAIRMAN O'DONNELL AND EVERYONE SERVING ON THESE COMMITTEES FOR TAKING THE ISSUE SERIOUSLY REALIZING THE EQUITY OF CREEK THEM OFFERING STARRCADE TOLL SYSTEM. YOUR COURAGE AND COMMITMENT TO PROVIDING THE NECESSARY FUNDS TO VOCATIONAL PROGRAMS THAT WILL HELP RESTORE COMMITMENT OF PRODUCT EVERY CHILD IN THE K. TWELVE SYSTEM. AND I KNOW I ONLY HAVE THREE MINUTES I'VE EXCEEDED EGGMAN EVERYBODY'S PROBABLY TIRED. BUT I WANT ALSO TELL YOU AS AN EMPLOYER. CURRENTLY TODAY I TURNED DOWN AN OPPORTUNITY TO GO WORK AT THE TEST LOW BATTERY FACTORY BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH EMPLOYEES WITH THE SKILL SETS REQUIRED TO DO THE WORK WE DO. I GOT A CALL TODAY FROM NORTH CAROLINA THEY WANT US TO COME UP AND HELP BUILD A PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY. FACILITY A TWO BILLION DOLLAR FACILITY. I HAD TO TURN HIM DOWN BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH SKILLS EMPLOYEES. THIS. A TRAGEDY. IT'S A MIDDLE CLASS JOB. IT'S SOMETHING THAT. I COULD DO. ANYBODY. AND I MAY HAVE A STUDENT TOWN TODAY BUT I CAN FROM A VERY POOR ENVIRONMENT AND I'VE BEEN A WORK MY WAY FOR BECAUSE OF CONTINUING EDUCATION. HER CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION SOMETHING THAT'S GOT TO BE FUNDED. FUNDED FULLY FUNDED CONSISTENTLY. AND AND FUNDED AT SOMETHING THAT IS IS. ASSIGNED TO THAT. THAT ISSUE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OKAY THANK YOU MISTER DAVIES VERY AUTHENTIC. A VERY AUTHENTIC. AND THINK YOUR YOUR EARS YET. ADDRESS WAS CLAPPING YOU CAN FOR HIM HE DID A GREAT JOB. IN ONE THE MORE AUTHENTIC SPEAKERS TODAY HONESTLY. BECAUSE YOU GET THE REAL LIFE STORY OF WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE DO HAVE CLEAR TECHNOLOGY ASIAN. AND WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE DON'T. AND THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE FACED WITH TODAY. AND YOU KNOW AS MY FATHER IN LAW WAS A SHEET METAL WORKER FOR PROBABLY WHAT THIRTY EIGHT YEARS. SINO Y. LE YOU KNOW. WHAT EQUALITY FEEL THAT IS TO ENTER AND HOW IT PROVIDES FOR FAMILY? YOU KNOW FED MY WIFE. ON HONOR I'D HEARD. YOUNG YEARS SELF THANK YOU. WITH THAT. WILL TURN TO. MARLENE GARCIA FROM COMPTON. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME GOOD AFTERNOON OF MY NAME IS MARLENE GARCIA I'M WITH APPLE EDUCATION I SPEAK TODAY AS A MEMBER COMPANY OF COMP HERE A NONPROFIT TRADE ASSOCIATION. SERVING AS A LEADING VOICE OF THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY IN THE COUNTRY. I'M HERE TODAY BECAUSE AB OUT THOUGH WE REALLY BELIEVE IN. PARTYING TWENTY FIRST CENTURY CT. SKILLS WITH STUDENTS BOB I WANT TO FOCUS MY COMMENTS BRIEFLY ON THE CHANGING NATURE OF THE WORKPLACE THE NEED FOR ALL STUDENTS TO HAVE EXPOSURE TO CODEINE AS ONE OF THOSE BASIC SKILLS. AND THEN ALSO THE NEED FOR US TO FUND TWENTY FIRST CENTURY CITY PROGRAMS. SO AT APPLE WE BELIEVE STRONGLY IN THE INVESTMENT OF CT SKILLS TWENTY FIRST CENTURY SKILLS BECAUSE TECHNOLOGY TOUCHES ALL FACETS OF OUR LIVES. THERE'S AN EXPLOSION OF JOBS REQUIRING COMPUTER SCIENCE ENCODING FOR NUMEROUS. ENTRY LEVEL POSITIONS THAT DON'T EVEN REQUIRE OF ADVANCED DEGREES. IN THE U. ALONE APPLE SUPPORTS TWO MILLION JOBS THROUGH AT FOR THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY IN ALL FIFTY STATES. INCLUDING ONE POINT FIVE MILLION APP ECONOMY JOBS AND FOR HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND JOBS ATTRIBUTABLE TO COMPANIES THAT. APPLE WORKS WITH AS SUPPLIERS. NEW MOST NOTABLY CALIFORNIA OF COURSE HAS THE HIGHEST CONCENTRATION OF AB SUPPLY OF. OF. U. S. BASED SUPPLIER COMPANIES AS WELL AS THE APP ECONOMY CHOPS. ACCORDING TO A RECENT REPORT BY CANTIERE THE CYBER STATES REPORT THERE'S BEEN A HUGE GROWTH IN TECHNOLOGY JOBS WHICH WE ALL KNOW BUT IN CALIFORNIA. THERE HAS BEEN THAT WE'VE ADDED FORTY EIGHT THOUSAND NEW TECHNOLOGY FALL INTO TWO CATEGORIES ONE IS YOUR TRADITIONAL TEXT THEM JOBS IN THERE ABOUT ONE POINT TWO MILLION. JOBS O. AVAILABLE TODAY AND THESE ARE THE JOBS FILLED BY TRADITIONAL TECH COMPANIES LIKE APPLE GOOGLE AS WELL AS START UPS. BUT INTERESTINGLY THERE'S A SECOND CATEGORY OF JOBS AND THESE ARE TECHNOLOGY OCCUPATIONS AND THESE ARE JOBS THAT DON'T NECESSARILY REQUIRE YOU TO BE AN EXPERT. PROGRAMMER BUT RATHER MODEST MIDDLE SKILL JOBS THAT COMPANIES ARE SEARCHING FOR PEOPLE TO FILL THESE KINDS OF JOBS WITHIN RETAIL HOSPITALITY. PRIVATE SECTOR AS WELL AS. GOVERNMENT IN EDUCATION. AND THESE ARE JOBS THAT WE THINK FALL SQUARELY IN THE IN IN IN THE CATEGORY OF QUALITY CAREER TECHNICAL ED JOBS. BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE JOB MARKETS BECOMING INCREASINGLY. AUTOMATED AND THERE'S A LOT OF FEAR ABOUT THIS BUT WE KNOW THAT THESE JOBS A SIX GREATER TODAY FOR EXAMPLE BY THE TIME THEY HIT THEIR THEIR PEAK JOB YEARS IN TWENTY THIRTY. ABOUT HALF OF TODAY'S JAWS WILL BE REPLACED WITH OTHER JOBS. LOT OF TIMES THESE JOBS ARE REFERRED TO AS NEW COLLAR JOBS. SO WE CAN'T PREDICT WHAT THOSE JOBS ARE GOING TO BE IN THE FUTURE BUT WE KNOW THAT THE KINDS OF SKILLS THAT STUDENTS ARE GIVEN NEED TO SUCCEED IN THESE EMERGING NEW JOBS THAT WE DON'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT TODAY. THAT THEIR SKILLS SUCH AS COMPUTATIONAL THINKING WORKING COLLABORATIVELY PROBLEM SOLVING SKILLS AND DIGITAL LITERACY SKILLS. AND WE'VE FOCUSED A LOT ON THE DIGITAL LITERACY SKILLS SO WE BELIEVE ALL STUDENTS SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO CODING. AND WE CONSIDER COATING THE NEW BASIC SKILLS ARE BASIC LITERACY SKILL FOR THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR ALL STUDENTS BE EXPOSED A COATING AT AN EARLY AGE INCLUDING C. STUDENTS. THIS MIGHT TURN ON THE LIGHT BULB AND HELP THEM DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THE TWO CAN GO INTO A HIGH DEMAND STEM FIELD WHICH WERE SORELY LACKING IN. GIRLS AND STUDENTS FROM DISADVANTAGED BACKGROUNDS. BUT EVEN IF THE STUDENT IS NOT A STEM ORIENTED STUDENT THE STONY THAT'S THAT EXPOSURE BECAUSE. TECHNOLOGY IS EMBEDDED IN VIRTUALLY ALL BUSINESSES NOW AND THEY'LL BE PART OF CREATING THESE NEW SYSTEMS AND THEY HAVE TO HAVE THAT BASIC EXPOSURE TO UNDERSTAND. THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY BUSINESS. AND LASTLY ABOUT CODING WE REALLY THINK IT'S IMPORTANT ARMOR STUDENTS WITH THE SKILLS THAT ALLOWED THEM TO CREATE TECHNOLOGY AND NOT JUST CONSUME TECHNOLOGY. SO LASTLY. AS EVERYONE HAS SAID TODAY WE NEED WE BELIEVE THAT WE NEED A CONTINUED INVESTMENT IN SQUALID ECT  <u><c.green>PROGRAMS WE KNOW ABOUT</c></u> THIRTY PERCENT OF THE STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA GO WANT YOUR TRADITIONAL. HIGHER ED. INSTITUTIONS BUT WHAT ABOUT THE REMAINING SEVENTY PERCENT WE BELIEVE IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO EXPOSE THEM TO THESE PALM DIGITAL SKILLS TO CLOSE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE AND PREPARE THEM FOR THOSE EMERGING JOBS. THAT ARE OPEN AND AVAILABLE IN OUR STATE AND OUR COUNTRY. AND. WE KNOW THAT FOR THE STUDENTS THEY CAN GET ONE OF THESE SIR SHORT TERM CERTIFICATE PROGRAMS AND NOT NECESSARILY HAVE TO PAY. THE HIGH COST OF A COLLEGE FOUR YEAR EDUCATION SO WE THINK FACT CAREER TECHNICAL ED PROGRAMS OFFER GREAT PROMISE TO STUDENTS. AND THEY GIVE THEM STUDENTS THE TRAINING THEY NEED THAT'S ESSENTIAL FOR PREPARING THEM FOR THE WORK OF THE FUTURE. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISS GARCIA THANK YOU FOR. IT'S GOOD TO HEAR APPLES VOICE IN THIS CAPITAL HONESTLY BECAUSE I CAN'T DO THIS ALONE I NEED TO HEAR FROM OUR INDUSTRY PARTNERS. AND OTHER ASSEMBLY MEMBERS NEED TO HEAR FROM INDUSTRY PARTNERS IF WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THE CHANGE WE NEED TO MAKE SO THANK YOU. I WOULD THAT. WILL HEAR FROM. JERRY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND ALL THAT OTHER CHAIRS OF THE. OTHER RELEVANT COMMITTEES THAT WERE HERE EARLIER IN HERE DAY WE THINK YOU AND YOUR STAFF FOR THE TIME. TODAY TO DO THE SECOND HEARING A LOT OF WHAT I SAID. IN BUENA PARK I WOULD'VE SAID AGAIN TODAY TIME. BUT THERE WAS TIME BUT I WANNA MAKE IS THE FEW NEW POINTS. WE BELIEVE. AS AT THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER A SAID THAT YOU NEED TO ATTRACT THESE KIDS TO THESE CAREERS THAT DON'T REQUIRE A UNIVERSITY EDUCATION. AND THAT CONSTRUCTION TRADES THAT'S. A. BECAUSE YOU CAN START WORKING RIGHT OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL AN APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM. AND THE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM IS THE COLLEGE IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY THAT'S THE THREE TO FIVE YEAR DEGREE DEPENDING ON THE CRAFT THAT YOU GO THROUGH THAT. WOULD. TAKE THE PLACE OF A TRADITIONAL FOR YOUR COLLEGE EDUCATION AND THE GOOD THING ABOUT A PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM OF THIS EARN WHILE YOU LEARN LEARN. EARLY LEARN YES. YOU ARE EARNING A LIVING WAGE WITH BENEFITS AND A PENSION AND HEALTH CARE. OF VACATION TIME ALL THOSE THINGS WHILE YOU'RE LEARNING THE CRAFT. NOW WE ARE IN OF A CONSTRUCTION BOOM RIGHT NOW IN PART OF THAT IS BECAUSE OF WHAT THIS LEGISLATURE IS DONE. WHETHER IT'S PASSING AFFORDABLE HOUSING LEGISLATION. THERE'S A GREAT NEED THEIR. SP ONE THAT JUST PASSED LAST YEAR AS WELL. TO FILL SOME OF THAT SEVENTY BILLION UNFUNDED LIABILITY AND ROAD MAINTENANCE AND CONSTRUCTION. THE WORK IS THERE TO FOR THE KIDS TO GO TO QUOTE UNQUOTE COLLEGE WHEN THEY'RE NOT PRESSURE PROGRAM ONLY THANK YOU OFFER THAT. SO THERE'S A GREAT CAREER OUT THERE WAITING FOR THESE KIDS I JOIN A PRESSURE PROGRAMS AND YOU'VE ALSO INCENTIVIZE THE USE OF A SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE ON DIFFERENT TYPES OF PROJECTS WHICH MEANS. GRADUATES OF STATE APPROVED THE PARTNERSHIP PROGRAMS. AND EVEN SEND A BY THE INCENTIVIZE THESE A PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENTS WHICH ALSO PUT. ABOUT GRADUATE THE STATE APPROVED THE PRESSURE PROGRAMS TO WORK. SO WE ARE VERY PLEASED THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS SEEN FIT TO EXTEND THE PROGRAM WE. AGREE WITH YOUR BILL MORE ABOUT HOW IT SHOULD BE EXTENDED BOTH IN TERMS OF MONEY AND IN TERMS OF OVERSIGHT. SO ABRASIVE PORT OF OF YOUR EFFORT. I WANTED JUST LEVY WITH TWO DOTS FIRST. IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THERE'S ONLY FOUR FUNDING STREAMS FOR CT IN THE STATE THE ANSWER NOT GRANT. PERKINS. THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THAT WOULD THAT HAVE BEEN IN THE LAST TWO SCHOOL BONDS FOR CT THE ARROGANCE AND GRANT. WE CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE THE C. FUNDING. A THIS PROGRAM IS THE FIRST DAY SO MANY DISTRICTS WANT MORE MONEY THAN THEY'RE GETTING NOW. AND FINALLY I WANT TO SAY THAT. WE PAY FOR THE STATE'S JOINT LABOR MANAGEMENT PRESSURE PROGRAMS. WE NEED THE STATE TO STEP IN AND PAY FOR THE CT  <u><c.green>PROGRAMS IN</c></u> THE HIGH SCHOOLS SO THAT THOSE KIDS CAN. MATRICULATED OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL INTO THE STATE A PUT A PRESSURE PROGRAMS THAT WE PROVIDE WITH. WITH OUR MONEY TO TRAIN THEM FOR THE CONSTRUCTION JOBS OF THE FUTURE THANK. THANK YOU A THIS RICE YOU'VE BEEN VERY PATIENT. THE LAST MERRILEES. THINKING OF HER THE WHOLE. AGAIN TO CALL RISE. I'M THE. LEVER AND POLICY. LABOR AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT POLICY DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION AND I JUST WANT TO START OUT BY SAYING THANK YOU TO YOU CHAIRED ON ALL ALL THE OTHER CHAIRS AND MEMBERS WHO ARE HERE. FROM THE RESPECTIVE COMMITTEES ABOUT YOUR COLLECTIVE LEADERSHIP AND PERSISTENCE TO ENSURING AND PRIORITIZING CRITIC EDUCATION ON IN THIS LEGISLATIVE SESSION. WHEN I WAS BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE. BEFORE AND WHEN ó PARK I SHARE THAT WE HAD EIGHT SHORT MONTHS BEFORE THE C. TAG FUNDING WAS ENDING IN TODAY WERE APPROXIMATELY AT FOUR MONTHS. BEFORE THIS IMPORTANT POLICY DRIVER THAT'S MAINTAINING ALL OF THESE PROGRAMS. EXPIRES. WHILE MANUFACTURERS ARE AND REMAIN ENCOURAGED BY THE ATTENTION AND DEDICATION THAT'S BEING PAID TO MAINTAINING FUNDING FOR THESE CRITICAL PROGRAMS. WE WANT A REALLY REMIND YOU ALL TODAY THAT THE FRAMEWORK FOR DELIVERY IS JUST AS IMPORTANT AS THE FUNDING. WHICH IS WHY CMT A CONTINUES TO SUPPORT A C. T. E. DELIVER DELIVERY MODEL THAT EMBODIES. KEY THESE THREE KEY ELEMENTS THE PERMANENT DEDICATING FUNDING BECAUSE THAT WILL ENSURE THAT YOU HAVE SUSTAINABLE PROGRAMS. ALIGNMENT TO INDUSTRY NEEDS THAT ARE INFORMED BY REGIONAL LABOR MARKET DATA BECAUSE THAT WILL ENSURE THAT WHAT WE'RE TRAINING STUDENTS TO. THEIR ACTUALLY JOBS AVAILABLE AND IN THERE YOU KNOW COMMUNITIES FOR THEM TO COMPETE FOR AND THEN REGIONALLY DELIVERED STATE LEADERSHIP THAT ENCOMPASSES STRONG ACCOUNTABILITY BECAUSE THAT WILL ENSURE THATYOU'RE GETTING YOUR RETURN ON YOUR INVESTMENT. AND ALSO ALL THREE OF THESE WILL ALSO ENSURE THAT THERE ARE HIGH QUALITY PROGRAMS DELIVERED FOR KRETEK EDUCATION WHICH IS I I THINK THAT WE ALL. IS OUR GOAL FOR EVERYONE TO ENSURE THAT STUDENTS CAN ACTUALLY. GET JOBS ON HAVE SOLID ON ECONOMIC FUTURES AND CAREER MOBILITY. A CALIFORNIA STUDENTS CANNOT COMPETE FOR TWENTY FIRST CENTURY JOBS WITH NINETEENTH CENTURY SKILLS AND TRAINING APPROACHES. AND MANUFACTURERS IN CALIFORNIA CANNOT CONTINUE TO INNOVATE WE CAN'T CONTINUE TO EXPAND WITHOUT A HIGH TRAINED WORKFORCE BECAUSE THE INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY AS MY PANEL MAY JUST SAT WILL NOT WAIT. THE INDUSTRIAL WORKFORCE PIPELINE IS DRY. AND THE SILVER TSUNAMI THAT WE ALL HEAR ABOUT WILL SOON OVERTAKE MANUFACTURING BECAUSE THE GENERATION THAT'S RESPONSIBLE FOR BUILDING THE WORLD THAT WE LIVE. CONTINUES TO RETIRE AND ACCELERATED RATE. EVERY TIME THAT WE CANNOT FIND ACCOUNT OF QUALIFIED CANDIDATES TO BACK FILL THOSE OPENINGS CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS LOSE THEIR COMPETITIVE EDGE. AND WITHOUT A PROPERLY TRAINED WORK FORCE WE CANNOT INCREASE PRODUCTION TO MEET INCREASING DEMAND WE CANNOT IMPLEMENT NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO INCREASE EFFICIENCIES AND ACHIEVE PRODUCTION TARGETS. WE CANNOT ENERGIES NEW PRODUCTS DIVERT AND DEVELOP THEM OR INNOVATE. WE CAN EVEN PROVIDE BETTER CUSTOMER SERVICE BECAUSE ALL OF THAT IS NOW WELL CONNECTED WITH THE INTERNET OF THINGS. AND ULTIMATELY WE CANNOT STRENGTH THE STATE'S MIDDLE CLASS ECONOMY. AND I WON'T GO INTO ALL THE STATISTICS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT WHERE TO PARK ABOUT WHAT WE'RE HEARING FROM OUR HR PROFESSIONALS RELATED TO MANUFACTURING AND. LOGISTIC FEELS ABOUT THE CANDIDATES THAT WERE SEEN YOU KNOW THE AND EXPERIENCE WITH HANDS ON TASKS IN THE. MECHANICAL APTITUDE AND AND THE DIFFICULTY THEY'RE HAVING ONCE THEY'RE INTEGRATING INTO THE WILL THE EXISTING WORKFORCE. BUT WHAT I WILL ENDED SAYING THAT AS THE GLOBAL MARKETPLACE DEMANDS GREATER INNOVATION. AND TECHNOLOGY APTITUDE MANUFACTURERS NEED A RELIABLE PIPELINE OF HIGHLY TRAINED INDIVIDUALS TO MEET BOTH OUR CURRENT AND OUR FUTURE JOB NEEDS. SEEM TABLE EXPORT TO CONTINUALLY WORKING WITH YOU TO ADDRESS THIS. OF SKILLS GAP ISSUE THIS CRITICAL SKILLS GAP ISSUE AND TO DIVERT. DEVELOP A SUSTAINABLE DELIVERY SYSTEM SO THINK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU WELL DONE ALL OF YOU. THANK YOU. THAT AS OUR LAST PANEL SO THANK YOU. WILL NOT TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT. YOU MAKE HIM A COME UP. STATE YOUR NAME AFFILIATION AND IF YOU HAVE IN THIS SHARE PLEASE KEEP IT TO ABOUT THIRTY SECONDS IF YOU COULD JUST BECAUSE. BEEN A LONG. DRIVER THIRTY. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS VALERIE THE SITCH I'M WITH THE FRESNO COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS OFFICE I'M THE ADMINISTRATOR FOR CRITIC AT ROP WE ARE STILL FUNCTIONING ROP IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. I'M I AM ONE OF THOSE SEVEN TECHNICAL SYSTEMS PROVIDERS THAT MISS WHITE SPOKE ABOUT EARLIER AND IRONICALLY THE REGION I SERVE WOULD BE THE SAME GEOGRAPHICAL AREA THAT. THE WORK FORCE THE GREATER WORKFORCE AND PEACE DOES I THINK IT'S INTERESTING THERE'S A COUPLE OF THINGS HAVE BEEN SAID TODAY THAT SORT OF PRESUME THAT K. TWELVE CT  <u><c.green>IS NOT AS.</c></u> INTEGRATED WITH OUR BUSINESS PARTNERS AS AS WE SHOULD BE AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ALL OF OUR PROGRAMS ARE ALIGNED WITH OUR REGIONAL WORKFORCE INITIATIVES. IN OUR STATEWIDE LABOR BECAUSE IT'S NOT MY JOB TO KEEP SOMEBODY IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY IT'S MY JOB TO MAKE SURE THEY KNOW WHAT THEIR. SKILLS ARE AND WHERE THEY NEED TO GO TO PURSUE THOSE SKILLS. I ALSO THINK IT'S REALLY CRITICAL THAT OF THE SIX THOUSAND HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS THAT I SERVING FRESNO ROP YOU HEARD FROM MY BIGGEST PARTNER FRESNO. BUT A SERVICE SMALLEST PARTNER WHICH IS LATENT WHICH HAS LESS THAN TWO HUNDRED STUDENTS. THE CAPACITY FOR THOSE SMALL RURAL DISTRICTS TO BE ABLE TO COMPETE AGAINST THEIR LARGER PARTNERS EVEN IN A TIERED SYSTEM IS GOING TO BE. VERY A TOUGH FOR THEM WHAT WE'VE LEARNED THROUGH OUR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WE PROVIDE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT A ONE ON ONE CONSULTATION. ON THE CHURN OF ADMINISTRATORS WHO HAVE NO CT EXPERIENCE THROUGH OUR SCHOOLS IS GREAT. AND THE STATE'S STABILITY THAT WE CAN PROVIDE IS A RADIO THANKS A FRESNO GOT THE MOST TIME TODAY. BUT THANK YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE THIS COMES. MARK EPSTEIN DIRECTOR CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION NETWORK OVER THE PAST THAT DECADE WE'VE BEEN ADVOCATING FOR ON A NUMBER OF CHANGES HOW STRUCTURALLY. DEALING WITH CTA CT  <u><c.green>FOR</c></u> THAT I WILL HIGHLIGHT VERY QUICKLY NUMBER ONE AND PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT IS WE NEED TO HAVE. A SET COLLEGE PREPARE TORY SEQUENCE FOR THE CT PATHWAYS. AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE A THREE G. SEQUENCE THAT HAS THE SAME RESPECT. AND ACCEPTANCE. TO. WE NEED REFORM OF THE ARTICULATION AGREEMENT PROCESS BETWEEN THE HIGH SCHOOLS IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES SPECIFICALLY ALLOWING HIGH SCHOOLS. TO MAKE AN ARTICULATION AGREEMENT WITH ANY COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN THE STATE AND NUMBER TWO IS ELIMINATING THE TWELVE HOUR RESIDENCY REQUIREMENT THAT HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS TO HAVE THOSE. CREDITS. GRANTED. NUMBER THREE AN* SUMMER YOUTH EMPLOYMENT PROGRAM WHICH IS IMPLEMENTED BY LAW HIPS. THAT WE NEED TO HAVE A VERY STRONG CONNECTION BETWEEN THE WORKING WITH THE LOCAL WHERE IT'S A VAT PROGRAM. AND THE SELECTING OF STUDENTS TO BE TIED TO THEIR LOCAL HIGH SCHOOLS CAREER PATHWAY IN ACADEMY PROGRAMS. NUMBER FOUR. IS THAT WITH THE REPEATEDLY OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE IN THE BREAKING DOWN OF OUR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROCESS WE NEED TO ALLOW THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS. TO ALLOW TECHNOLOGY PROFESSIONALS O BE TEACHERS OF RECORD FOR AUGMENTIN INSTRUCTION IN A PARTNERSHIP. WITH ON CREDENTIALED TEACHERS AND LAST WE HEARD A LOT ABOUT THE STATISTICS ON THE BENEFITS A CT. ONE THING THAT WAS NOT MENTIONED AT ALL IS THAT THOSE STUDIES. THAT GIVE DIFFERENTIATE BY GENDER. FIND THAT THE BENEFIT IS SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER FOR MALES AND AS SUCH FOR THE FOLKS OUT HERE. I THINK THERE MAY BE A CASE FOR THE LACK OF SUPPORT TO CT  <u><c.green>COULD BE LABELLED AS</c></u> DISCRIMINATION AGAINST MALE STUDENTS. THANK YOU.
