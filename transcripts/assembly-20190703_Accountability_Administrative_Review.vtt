00:40:12.209 --> 00:40:14.245
WE CAN KEEP ANIMALS INTO SAFE

00:40:14.311 --> 00:40:15.846
PROTECTED AREA.

00:40:15.913 --> 00:40:17.948
THAT'S ALWAYS THE BEST THING SO

00:40:18.015 --> 00:40:19.416
I THINK THIS IS A UNIQUE

00:40:19.483 --> 00:40:21.819
OPPORTUNITY TO PRESERVE A

00:40:21.886 --> 00:40:23.821

IRREPLACEABLE LAND WHICH IS

00:40:38.702 --> 00:40:39.804
REALLY A BENEFIT TO ALL

GOOD MORNING.

00:41:04.395 --> 00:41:05.963
COMMITTEE TERRY MCHALE WITH

00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:07.097
THEIR AND READ AND SO SEATS.

00:41:07.164 --> 00:41:08.532
REPRESENTING A CONSORTIUM OF OUR

00:41:08.599 --> 00:41:10.367
OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLE RECREATION

00:41:10.434 --> 00:41:11.669
THIS.

00:41:11.735 --> 00:41:13.204
WE OPPOSE THIS BILL LAST YEAR.

00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:14.772
AND WE OPPOSE IT THIS YEAR THE

00:41:14.839 --> 00:41:16.173
MAJOR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LAST

00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:17.107
YEAR AND THIS YEAR.

00:41:17.174 --> 00:41:18.576
IS THAT THE PURCHASE PRICE LAST

00:41:18.642 --> 00:41:20.744
YEAR WAS THE WAS THE CEILING IN

00:41:20.811 --> 00:41:22.179
THIS YEAR IT'S THE FLOOR.

00:41:22.246 --> 00:41:24.048
BUT IT'S STILL NOT ENOUGH AND WE

00:41:24.114 --> 00:41:25.482
WOULD SUGGEST IF THIS GOES TO IF

00:41:25.549 --> 00:41:27.251
IT GOES TO APPROPRIATIONS AND

00:41:27.318 --> 00:41:28.586
FURTHER DISCUSSIONS.

00:41:28.652 --> 00:41:31.088
THAT IF THIS LAND IS SOLD IT

00:41:31.155 --> 00:41:32.756
SOLD AT MARKET VALUE.

00:41:32.823 --> 00:41:34.792
THIS PROPERTY WAS SET ASIDE FOR

00:41:34.859 --> 00:41:36.060
A SPECIFIC PURPOSE.

00:41:36.126 --> 00:41:37.461
HE WAS SET ASIDE BY EARMARKED

00:41:37.528 --> 00:41:40.197
FUNDS AND WAS SATISFIED BY

00:41:40.264 --> 00:41:42.266
PEOPLE WHO PAID FOR THROUGH THE

00:41:42.333 --> 00:41:44.134
RECREATIONAL ACTIVITY AND THE

00:41:44.201 --> 00:41:45.803
RED AND GREEN STICKER FEE.

00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:47.738
THAT MONEY IS REAL IT BELONGS TO

00:41:47.805 --> 00:41:49.406
THEM AND BE WRONG TO STEAL THEIR

00:41:49.473 --> 00:41:51.942
LAND AND THEN TAKE THEIR MONEY.

00:41:52.009 --> 00:41:54.745
TO NUMBER.

00:41:54.812 --> 00:41:55.813
TWO WE SPENT A YEAR.

00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:56.814
WORKING ON OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLE

00:41:56.881 --> 00:41:58.582
RECREATION TO MAKE THE OF THE

00:41:58.649 --> 00:42:00.017
PROGRAM PERMANENT.

00:42:00.084 --> 00:42:02.519
THE BILL WAS SB.

00:42:02.586 --> 00:42:03.487
TWO FORTY NINE IT WAS SUGGESTED

00:42:03.554 --> 00:42:07.191
IN EARLIER TESTIMONY THAT HAD SB

00:42:07.258 --> 00:42:08.158
TWO FORTY NINE BEEN IN PLACE.

00:42:08.225 --> 00:42:09.126
THAT TESLA WOULD HAVE BEEN

00:42:09.193 --> 00:42:11.695
PRESERVED AS IT EXISTS RIGHT NOW.

00:42:11.762 --> 00:42:13.831
LET ME BE CLEAR I SAT IN ON

00:42:13.898 --> 00:42:15.566
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE

00:42:15.633 --> 00:42:18.469
MEETINGS ON SB.

00:42:18.535 --> 00:42:18.903
TWO FORTY NINE TESLA

00:42:18.969 --> 00:42:20.371
REPRESENTATIVES CAME TO THE

00:42:20.437 --> 00:42:21.972
BEGINNING OF THE DISCUSSION AND

00:42:22.039 --> 00:42:24.008
THEN LEFT AND REFUSED TO

00:42:24.074 --> 00:42:25.709
PARTICIPATE.

00:42:25.776 --> 00:42:26.844
AND THE REASON THEY REFUSE TO

00:42:26.911 --> 00:42:28.913
PARTICIPATE IS BECAUSE WE WOULD

00:42:28.979 --> 00:42:30.147
NOT.

00:42:30.214 --> 00:42:32.850
WE WOULD NOT DO WHAT THIS BILL

00:42:32.917 --> 00:42:33.884
DOES.

00:42:33.951 --> 00:42:35.586
SO AND I ALSO BELIEVE THAT THEY

00:42:35.653 --> 00:42:36.921
WITHDREW.

00:42:36.987 --> 00:42:38.255
THEIR SUPPORT FOR THE BILL THEY

00:42:38.322 --> 00:42:39.590
DID NOT EVEN SUPPORT THE BILL

00:42:39.657 --> 00:42:41.558
WHEN IT WAS CONCLUDED.

00:42:41.625 --> 00:42:43.394
NUMBER THREE THERE ARE TWO

00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:45.162
HUNDRED AND FIFTY PLUS STATE

00:42:45.229 --> 00:42:46.597
PARKS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

00:42:46.664 --> 00:42:48.165
ALL OF THEM HAVE EXTRAORDINARY

00:42:48.232 --> 00:42:50.334
VALUE -- HD SUPPORTS THE

00:42:50.401 --> 00:42:52.403
CATHEDRAL PARKS WE SUPPORT THE

00:42:52.469 --> 00:42:54.238
PARKS WHERE YOU CAN WALK WE

00:42:54.305 --> 00:42:55.472
SUPPORT THE PARKS.

00:42:55.539 --> 00:42:57.141
YOU KNOW THAT THAT FAMILIES GO

00:42:57.207 --> 00:42:58.609
TO PICNIC OR PEOPLE GOING TO

00:42:58.676 --> 00:43:00.978
HIKE ONLY EIGHT OF THEM. EIGHT

00:43:01.045 --> 00:43:02.980
OF THEM ARE OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLE

00:43:03.047 --> 00:43:04.515
RECREATION AREAS.

00:43:04.581 --> 00:43:06.216
THEY PRODUCE A BILLION DOLLAR

00:43:06.283 --> 00:43:07.351
INDUSTRY FOR THE STATE OF

00:43:07.418 --> 00:43:08.252
CALIFORNIA.

00:43:08.319 --> 00:43:10.621
IT'S A IT'S A PROGRAM THAT.

00:43:10.688 --> 00:43:13.023
THE THE DIRECTOR OF CAL PARKS

00:43:13.090 --> 00:43:16.060
CALLED IN TESTIMONY.

00:43:16.126 --> 00:43:17.561
A NATIONAL MODEL.

00:43:17.628 --> 00:43:19.763
US SO THE IDEA YOU KNOW WHEN I

00:43:19.830 --> 00:43:21.398
BILL SHOW THE PICTURES ALSO THE

00:43:21.465 --> 00:43:22.700
DAMAGED HILLSIDES.

00:43:22.766 --> 00:43:24.501
IN THOSE SAY THIS IS AN EXAMPLE.

00:43:24.568 --> 00:43:26.270
OF THE CORRUPTING INFLUENCE OF

00:43:26.337 --> 00:43:27.805
HV.

00:43:27.871 --> 00:43:28.405
WELL I WOULD SAY THERE'S ONLY

00:43:28.472 --> 00:43:30.774
EIGHT OF AND WHEN I GO TO AN OHP

00:43:30.841 --> 00:43:32.242
PARK AND I SEE THOSE HILLSIDES

00:43:32.309 --> 00:43:34.211
WITH PATHWAYS I SEE A SAFER WAY

00:43:34.278 --> 00:43:35.312
TO RECREATION.

00:43:35.379 --> 00:43:36.814
BUT I ALSO WANT TO EMPHASIZE

00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:39.516
THAT EIGHTH SB TWO FORTY NINE

00:43:39.583 --> 00:43:40.184
WHEN YOU SEE THAT CORRUPTED HILL

00:43:40.250 --> 00:43:42.786
SIDE.

00:43:42.853 --> 00:43:43.954
WE HAVE MADE AN AGREEMENT.

00:43:44.021 --> 00:43:44.922
THAT IT WILL BE RESTORED

00:43:44.989 --> 00:43:45.956
PERIODICALLY TO PRISTINE

00:43:46.023 --> 00:43:47.725
ACTIVITY AND WE MOVED TO A

00:43:47.791 --> 00:43:49.827
DIFFERENT AREA WITHIN THE PARK --

00:43:49.893 --> 00:43:51.528
HV RECREATION AS A NATIONAL

00:43:51.595 --> 00:43:53.063
MODEL BECAUSE THERE ARE MORE

00:43:53.130 --> 00:43:55.232
SCIENTISTS WORKING -- FOR H. B.

00:43:55.299 --> 00:43:56.734
RECREATION THAN ANY OTHER PART

00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:58.202
OF THE PARKS.

00:43:58.268 --> 00:44:00.070
THAT WE SPEND MORE TIME ON

00:44:00.137 --> 00:44:02.339
CULTURAL AND NATURAL RESOURCES

00:44:02.406 --> 00:44:02.873
THAN ANY OTHER PART OF THE

00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:04.141
PARK'S.

00:44:04.208 --> 00:44:07.311
WHEN THE INDIVIDUALS UP HERE SAY

00:44:07.378 --> 00:44:08.412
THAT THEY'RE CONCERNED?

00:44:08.479 --> 00:44:10.047
THAT -- H. B. WILL DESTROY THE

00:44:10.114 --> 00:44:11.815
AREA I WOULD SUGGEST ALSO THAT

00:44:11.882 --> 00:44:13.417
THERE ARE AREAS IN ALMOST EVERY

00:44:13.484 --> 00:44:15.652
OHB PARKING WHICH CULTURAL AND

00:44:15.719 --> 00:44:18.222
NATURAL RESOURCES ARE SET ASIDE

00:44:18.288 --> 00:44:19.490
AND PRESERVED.

00:44:19.556 --> 00:44:22.092
NUMBER FOUR IMAGINE WE'RE NOT

00:44:22.159 --> 00:44:22.860
TALKING ABOUT A WAY TO BE.

00:44:22.926 --> 00:44:25.362
IMAGINE THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT

00:44:25.429 --> 00:44:27.297
OFF HIGHWAY VEHICLE RECREATION.

00:44:27.364 --> 00:44:28.565
THEN I WOULD SUGGEST THAT WE ARE

00:44:28.632 --> 00:44:32.236
ESTABLISHING A VERY DIFFICULT

00:44:32.302 --> 00:44:34.405
BUREAUCRATIC PROCESS. FOR

00:44:34.471 --> 00:44:37.241
DECADES WHEN LOCAL PROPERTY IS

00:44:37.307 --> 00:44:38.542
GOING TO BE USED BY THE STATE

00:44:38.609 --> 00:44:40.778
THERE ARE EXTENSIVE HEARINGS AND

00:44:40.844 --> 00:44:42.246
THE LOCALS ARE INVITED TO BE A

00:44:42.312 --> 00:44:43.847
PART OF IT.

00:44:43.914 --> 00:44:46.717
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED HERE.

00:44:46.784 --> 00:44:49.219
NOW WHAT THIS BILL SAYS IS OKAY

00:44:49.286 --> 00:44:50.454
THERE IS AN AGREEMENT THE MONEY

00:44:50.521 --> 00:44:52.256
IS SET ASIDE FOR ABOUT TO DO IT

00:44:52.322 --> 00:44:53.590
AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO THROW

00:44:53.657 --> 00:44:54.992
THAT PROCESS OUT.

00:44:55.059 --> 00:44:56.193
AND MAKE IT A MULLIGAN.

00:44:56.260 --> 00:44:58.529
AND WE'RE GONNA GO BACK AND REDO

00:44:58.595 --> 00:44:58.962
THE HEARINGS AGAIN.

00:44:59.029 --> 00:45:00.130
WELL.

00:45:00.197 --> 00:45:01.532
IF YOU LIVE IN A BEACH AREA THEN

00:45:01.598 --> 00:45:02.533
YOU WAKE UP AND YOU SAY I DON'T

00:45:02.599 --> 00:45:03.967
WANT MY BEACH BEING TOUCH

00:45:04.034 --> 00:45:05.569
BECAUSE PEOPLE SHOW UP AND RUN

00:45:05.636 --> 00:45:07.171
ON THE BEACH ARE GONNA CREATE.

00:45:07.237 --> 00:45:08.972
DUST PARTICULATES ARE TOO MUCH

00:45:09.039 --> 00:45:10.774
NOISE OR TOO MUCH TRAFFIC WE'RE

00:45:10.841 --> 00:45:12.810
GONNA HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT.

00:45:12.876 --> 00:45:13.610
AND IF YOU GO TO AN AREA WHERE

00:45:13.677 --> 00:45:14.878
IT'S MOUNTAIN BIKING.

00:45:14.945 --> 00:45:16.180
AND PEOPLE ARE UPSET BECAUSE THE

00:45:16.246 --> 00:45:17.714
RIGHTS OF THE MOUNTAIN BIKE

00:45:17.781 --> 00:45:18.348
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DEAL WITH

00:45:18.415 --> 00:45:19.049
THAT.

00:45:19.116 --> 00:45:20.717
AND IF YOU DON'T LIKE HORSES IN

00:45:20.784 --> 00:45:22.086
THESE AREAS AND WHAT WE SET

00:45:22.152 --> 00:45:23.587
ASIDE THE HORSES WE GO BACK AND

00:45:23.654 --> 00:45:25.289
LOCAL SAY MY GOD HORSES DO WITH

00:45:25.355 --> 00:45:26.890
HORSES DO.

00:45:26.957 --> 00:45:27.491
AND WE DON'T WANT THAT BEING

00:45:27.558 --> 00:45:30.060
DONE WHAT THIS WOULD DO WOULD BE

00:45:30.127 --> 00:45:32.129
TO SET UP A PRECEDENT IN WHICH

00:45:32.196 --> 00:45:33.063
ALL.

00:45:33.130 --> 00:45:34.698
OF THE LANDS BEING SET ASIDE BY

00:45:34.765 --> 00:45:37.067
NATURAL RESOURCES BY RESOURCES

00:45:37.134 --> 00:45:38.802
OR BY PARKS WOULD BE OPEN TO THE

00:45:38.869 --> 00:45:40.504
DISCUSSION.

00:45:40.571 --> 00:45:41.805
NUMBER.

00:45:41.872 --> 00:45:43.273
FIVE THIS BILL ONLY SAYS.

00:45:43.340 --> 00:45:45.542
IF IT TURNS OUT THAT THE PROCESS

00:45:45.609 --> 00:45:48.045
OF PROCESSES BEEN TRIED AND TRUE

00:45:48.112 --> 00:45:49.613
AND EFFECTIVE IN WORKABLE WAS

00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:51.381
SOMEHOW FAULTED.

00:45:51.448 --> 00:45:53.183
AND I DON'T BELIEVE IT WAS OR IF

00:45:53.250 --> 00:45:55.119
IT SAYS THAT THOSE INDIVIDUALS

00:45:55.185 --> 00:45:57.454
IN THE LOCALS WHO SIGNED OFF.

00:45:57.521 --> 00:45:59.189
ON TESLA.

00:45:59.256 --> 00:46:00.858
MANY OF THEM WHO MADE AGREEMENTS

00:46:00.924 --> 00:46:03.026
AS TESLA WAS SATISFIED.

00:46:03.093 --> 00:46:04.862
NOW SAY THAT IT'S UNFAIR.

00:46:04.928 --> 00:46:06.663
THEN THE LAND GETS SOLD.

00:46:06.730 --> 00:46:08.132
I WOULD LIKE TO BE ON RECORD AND

00:46:08.198 --> 00:46:09.833
I'D LIKE THE LEGISLATURE TO BE

00:46:09.900 --> 00:46:11.735
ON RECORD TO STATE OF THE COURTS.

00:46:11.802 --> 00:46:13.904
IF PER CHANCE THIS BILL PASSES

00:46:13.971 --> 00:46:16.106
AND SIGNED IN TAKES PLACE.

00:46:16.173 --> 00:46:17.574
AFTER THE HEARING TAKES PLACE

00:46:17.641 --> 00:46:18.909
AND IT TURNS OUT.

00:46:18.976 --> 00:46:21.145
THAT PARKS DID EVERYTHING RIGHT.

00:46:21.211 --> 00:46:23.680
THAT WE STOP THE NONSENSE AND WE

00:46:23.747 --> 00:46:25.449
EXPEDITE MAKING THIS -- HV

00:46:25.516 --> 00:46:27.217
PROPERTY.

00:46:27.284 --> 00:46:29.453
A NUMBER NINE IT'S JUST ON A

00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:31.221
PERSONAL NOTE.

00:46:31.288 --> 00:46:33.657
THIS IS A VERY PASSIONATE ISSUE --

00:46:33.724 --> 00:46:34.992
ERIN RITA SO SEATS WERE LUCKY TO

00:46:35.058 --> 00:46:36.793
REPRESENT A LOT OF EXCELLENT

00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:37.394
CLIENTS.

00:46:37.461 --> 00:46:38.495
THE WAY TO BE IS ALWAYS SORT OF

00:46:38.562 --> 00:46:39.863
THE RED HEADED STEP CHILD OF

00:46:39.930 --> 00:46:40.931
PARKS.

00:46:40.998 --> 00:46:42.633
IT'S DIFFICULT TO COME IN AND IT

00:46:42.699 --> 00:46:43.934
GETS VERY PASSIONATE ON A

00:46:44.001 --> 00:46:44.935
PERSONAL NOTE I WANT TO SAY I

00:46:45.002 --> 00:46:46.403
ALWAYS DISLIKED BEING ON THE

00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:48.805
OPPOSITE SIDE OF SENATOR GLAZER.

00:46:48.872 --> 00:46:50.174
I THINK HE'S AN INCREDIBLY

00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:51.708
CONSCIENTIOUS LEGISLATOR.

00:46:51.775 --> 00:46:52.976
AND I DON'T THINK THERE'S

00:46:53.043 --> 00:46:54.545
ANYBODY WHO WORKS HARDER FOR HIS

00:46:54.611 --> 00:46:55.679
CONSTITUENTS.

00:46:55.746 --> 00:46:56.947
AND I KNOW THE BILL WAS UP LAST

00:46:57.014 --> 00:46:58.415

00:46:58.482 --> 00:47:00.184

00:47:00.250 --> 00:47:01.218
THIS BILL.

00:47:01.285 --> 00:47:03.587
HOWEVER HAVING SAID THAT I THINK

00:47:03.654 --> 00:47:05.789
IT IS WRONG CITED I THINK IT

00:47:05.856 --> 00:47:07.324
GOES IN THE WRONG DIRECTION.

00:47:07.391 --> 00:47:09.560
AND I WOULD ASK THAT YOU

00:47:09.626 --> 00:47:13.463
REJECTED THANK YOU VERY MUCH --

00:47:13.530 --> 00:47:14.932

GRANITE AND I'M REPRESENTING THE

00:47:17.201 --> 00:47:18.635
OFF ROAD VEHICLE LEGISLATIVE

00:47:18.702 --> 00:47:21.405
COALITION -- BUT I HAVE TO

00:47:21.471 --> 00:47:22.539
CONFESS THAT I'M JUST AN AVERAGE

00:47:22.606 --> 00:47:24.374
OFF ROADER I'M NOT A LOBBYIST

00:47:24.441 --> 00:47:25.909
AND I DON'T SPEAK PROFESSIONALLY

00:47:25.976 --> 00:47:27.511
IN FRONT OF HEARINGS.

00:47:27.578 --> 00:47:28.612
BUT WHAT I DO WANT TO SAY IS

00:47:28.679 --> 00:47:30.314
THAT AS AN AVERAGE OFF ROADER

00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:31.515
AVERAGE OPERATORS DESERVE A

00:47:31.582 --> 00:47:33.350
VOICE TO AND THAT'S SOMETHING

00:47:33.417 --> 00:47:34.851
THEY HAVE NOT BEEN GRANTED AT

00:47:34.918 --> 00:47:36.887
ALL IN THIS PROCESS AND IT'S

00:47:36.954 --> 00:47:39.423
VERY VERY FRUSTRATING -- INSTEAD

00:47:39.489 --> 00:47:40.724
WE'VE BEEN PAINTED AS

00:47:40.791 --> 00:47:42.492

00:47:42.559 --> 00:47:43.560
WITH.

00:47:43.627 --> 00:47:46.630
MANY MANY ADJECTIVES THAT NOBODY

00:47:46.697 --> 00:47:47.864
WOULD LIKE TO BEAR.

00:47:47.931 --> 00:47:48.999
SOMETIMES IT'S DIFFICULT TO

00:47:49.066 --> 00:47:51.568
SPEAK TRUTH TO POWER BUT IN THIS

00:47:51.635 --> 00:47:53.370
CASE WE FIND THAT WE HAVE.

00:47:53.437 --> 00:47:54.571
TO THE ILL CONCEIVED TRAVESTY

00:47:54.638 --> 00:47:56.940
THAT IS SB SEVEN SIXTY SEVEN IS

00:47:57.007 --> 00:47:59.843

CONTINUE TO BE POLITE.

00:48:01.278 --> 00:48:02.446
EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS BILL

00:48:02.512 --> 00:48:04.715
CHEATS THE AVERAGE CALIFORNIA AS

00:48:04.781 --> 00:48:05.949
WEALTHY AND POLITICALLY

00:48:06.016 --> 00:48:07.351
CONNECTED INDIVIDUALS USE

00:48:07.417 --> 00:48:09.419
POLITICIANS AND THE POLITICAL

00:48:09.486 --> 00:48:11.421
SYSTEM TO GET THEIR WAY.

00:48:11.488 --> 00:48:12.756
NOW THE BILL HAS BEEN AMENDED TO

00:48:12.823 --> 00:48:14.558
CHEAT OFF ROADERS OUT OF THE

00:48:14.625 --> 00:48:16.393
LAND THEY PAID FOR OUT OF THE

00:48:16.460 --> 00:48:20.364
WHICH WE TRUST FUND.

00:48:20.430 --> 00:48:21.365

00:48:21.431 --> 00:48:22.866

00:48:22.933 --> 00:48:24.101
REIMBURSEMENT.

00:48:24.167 --> 00:48:26.136
AS OFF ROADERS WE GET USED TO

00:48:26.203 --> 00:48:28.305
THE NAME CALLING WE GET USED TO

00:48:28.372 --> 00:48:30.540
THE IDEOLOGY BASED ON HATE FOR

00:48:30.607 --> 00:48:31.808
WHAT WE DO.

00:48:31.875 --> 00:48:33.644
THIS BILL ALSO CHEATS STATE

00:48:33.710 --> 00:48:35.445
PARKS AT OF ALL THE TIME AND ALL

00:48:35.512 --> 00:48:37.514
THE MONEY THEY SPENT OVER THE

00:48:37.581 --> 00:48:39.349
LAST TWENTY YEARS PUTTING INTO

00:48:39.416 --> 00:48:41.551

TESSLER EXPANSION AREA. FOR WHAT

00:48:42.986 --> 00:48:45.422
GOAL.

00:48:45.489 --> 00:48:47.524
WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DO IS

00:48:47.591 --> 00:48:49.026
PRIVATIZE A STATE PARK? TO

00:48:49.092 --> 00:48:51.395
CREATE AN EXCLUSIVE PLAYGROUND

00:48:51.461 --> 00:48:53.330
CLOSE TO ANYONE THAT OTHERS

00:48:53.397 --> 00:48:54.464
WOULD DEEM UNWORTHY.

00:48:54.531 --> 00:48:56.033
IT SETS A DANGEROUS PRECEDENT

00:48:56.099 --> 00:48:57.668
THAT WOULD ALLOW ANY SEMBLANCE

00:48:57.734 --> 00:48:59.369
OF ACCUSATION TO BE USED AS AN

00:48:59.436 --> 00:49:02.105
EXCUSE. TO FORCE THE SALE OF A

00:49:02.172 --> 00:49:03.674

00:49:06.677 --> 00:49:08.278
RESPECTFULLY THIS BILL WOULD

00:49:08.345 --> 00:49:09.513
DEPRIVE THOUSANDS OF

SPENT PER STATE LAW WITH GOOD

00:49:14.718 --> 00:49:15.819
INTENT AND WHAT COULD.

00:49:15.886 --> 00:49:17.621
CAUSE HARM TO THE AREA ITSELF

00:49:17.688 --> 00:49:19.289
COUNTER TO WHAT IS PREVIOUSLY

00:49:19.356 --> 00:49:20.991

ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION.

01:21:26.314 --> 01:21:28.650
SCENE NINE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS

01:21:28.717 --> 01:21:30.285
FROM THE COMMITTEE.

01:21:30.352 --> 01:21:34.522
MS QUIRK SILVA -- MISTER BAILEY

01:21:34.589 --> 01:21:35.757
JUST AYE IN HOUSING AND I

01:21:35.824 --> 01:21:37.692
BELIEVE THIS BILL IS DOUBLE

01:21:37.759 --> 01:21:38.460
REFERRED.

01:21:38.526 --> 01:21:40.929
YES -- BECAUSE MANY OF THESE

01:21:40.996 --> 01:21:42.964
TOPICS CROSS BOTH OF THEM

01:21:43.031 --> 01:21:44.366
ACCOUNTABILITY AND ONE OF THE

01:21:44.432 --> 01:21:45.934
THINGS THAT I PARTICULARLY LIKE

01:21:46.001 --> 01:21:47.469
ABOUT THIS BILL.

01:21:47.535 --> 01:21:50.905
IS I HAVE BEEN ON ACCOUNT AMID

01:21:50.972 --> 01:21:51.673
ACCOUNTABILITY COMMITTEE.

01:21:51.740 --> 01:21:53.141
FOR LEAVE THIS IS MY FOURTH YEAR

01:21:53.208 --> 01:21:54.876
AND SOMETIMES WE HAVE

01:21:54.943 --> 01:21:57.078
OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE DON'T TAKE

01:21:57.145 --> 01:21:59.214
TO KIND OF STREAMLINE AND SO

01:21:59.281 --> 01:22:01.449
FORTH BUT OTHER TIMES -- WERE

01:22:01.516 --> 01:22:03.718
FORCED TO AND I BELIEVE THAT

01:22:03.785 --> 01:22:06.388
THIS BILL ALTHOUGH WE SAY IT'S A

01:22:06.454 --> 01:22:07.689
SIMPLE BILL IT'S REALLY.

01:22:07.756 --> 01:22:10.759
ON A MUCH MORE THAN THAT BECAUSE

01:22:10.825 --> 01:22:12.360
OF ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE

01:22:12.427 --> 01:22:13.895
KNOW IS IT'S NOT JUST EACH

01:22:13.962 --> 01:22:16.464
COMMUNITY OR EACH CITY.

01:22:16.531 --> 01:22:20.368
OR COUNTY THAT IS NOW.

01:22:20.435 --> 01:22:21.836
FORCED TO LOOK AT THIS A VERY

01:22:21.903 --> 01:22:23.938
SERIOUS TOPIC OF A HOMELESS

01:22:24.005 --> 01:22:25.073
CRISIS.

01:22:25.140 --> 01:22:27.442
BUT IT'S ALSO ONCE WE PUT

01:22:27.509 --> 01:22:29.878
FORWARD THE TOOLS WHETHER IT BE

01:22:29.944 --> 01:22:33.114
WITH FUNDING WHETHER IT BE WITH --

01:22:33.181 --> 01:22:34.916
VARIOUS TYPES OF GRANTS -- SO

01:22:34.983 --> 01:22:37.786
FORTH IT'S ALSO GIVING THE TOOLS

01:22:37.852 --> 01:22:40.121
TO THE LOCAL I. ENTITIES TO

01:22:40.188 --> 01:22:42.357
NAVIGATE THEM AND THE MORE WORK

01:22:42.424 --> 01:22:44.259
IT TAKES TO NAVIGATE WHETHER

01:22:44.326 --> 01:22:46.661
IT'S FOR A GRANT WHETHER IT'S

01:22:46.728 --> 01:22:48.897
DEFINED -- LAND THAT IS

01:22:48.963 --> 01:22:51.499
AVAILABLE THAT JUST ADDS TIME

01:22:51.566 --> 01:22:53.034
LET ALONE ALL THE OTHER BARRIERS

01:22:53.101 --> 01:22:55.203
BUT AN EXAMPLE IS AND ONE OF

01:22:55.270 --> 01:22:57.605
PARK THE MY AREA.

01:22:57.672 --> 01:23:01.109
THEY ARE MOVING FORWARD ON A A

01:23:01.176 --> 01:23:02.610
MERGING STATE SHELTER AND

01:23:02.677 --> 01:23:04.212
BECAUSE THERE WAS QUITE A BIT OF

01:23:04.279 --> 01:23:07.248
OUTCRY -- ONE OF THE WAYS THE

01:23:07.315 --> 01:23:09.384
COUNCIL OF MOVE FORWARD WAS

01:23:09.451 --> 01:23:10.452
INSTEAD OF LOOKING AT THE

01:23:10.518 --> 01:23:12.754
ORIGINAL SITE THEY HAD SHOWS AND

01:23:12.821 --> 01:23:16.157
THEY ASK THE CITY MANAGER. TO

01:23:16.224 --> 01:23:19.027
LOOK FOR ANOTHER SPOT.

01:23:19.094 --> 01:23:21.930
THAT THE CITY OWNED AND WITHIN A

01:23:21.996 --> 01:23:24.232
MEETING HE CAME BACK WITH A

01:23:24.299 --> 01:23:25.100
PARCEL THAT.

01:23:25.166 --> 01:23:27.302
REALLY WASN'T ON ANYBODY'S RADAR

01:23:27.369 --> 01:23:29.070
THE PUBLIC WAS MUCH HAPPIER WITH

01:23:29.137 --> 01:23:30.171
THAT.

01:23:30.238 --> 01:23:32.340
AND NOW SUPPORT IT BECAUSE IT

01:23:32.407 --> 01:23:34.209
WAS A PIECE OF LAND THAT REALLY

01:23:34.275 --> 01:23:35.844
WAS ON ANYBODY SO RADAR SO I

01:23:35.910 --> 01:23:39.514
BELIEVE THIS DATABASE WILL ALLOW

01:23:39.581 --> 01:23:41.416
NOT ONLY LIKE YOU SAY DEVELOPERS

01:23:41.483 --> 01:23:43.184
BUT THE PUBLIC.

01:23:43.251 --> 01:23:45.253
COMMUNITIES LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES

01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:47.555
COUNTY AND GOING IN AND KIND OF

01:23:47.622 --> 01:23:53.128
HAVE A MAP FOR NAVIGATION OF

01:23:53.194 --> 01:23:53.728
WAIT WE REALLY DIDN'T EXPECT

01:23:53.795 --> 01:23:54.529
THIS. FOUR YEARS AGO ON

01:23:54.596 --> 01:23:55.830
ACCOUNTABILITY WE WERE ACTUALLY

01:23:55.897 --> 01:23:57.999
DOING THE OPPOSITE OF THIS WE

01:23:58.066 --> 01:24:01.970
WERE OF TRYING TO GET RID OF

01:24:02.036 --> 01:24:04.639
LAND -- THAT WAS NOT USED IN THE

01:24:04.706 --> 01:24:06.808
WAY IT WAS A ORIGINALLY A

01:24:06.875 --> 01:24:08.843
DETERMINED CAMPS UP IN DIFFERENT

01:24:08.910 --> 01:24:11.346
AREAS I KNOW IT WAS A ONE OF A

01:24:11.413 --> 01:24:13.014
YOUTH CAMP IN OUR AREA IN

01:24:13.081 --> 01:24:14.783
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.

01:24:14.849 --> 01:24:15.884
THAT WAS BUT THINGS HAVE CHANGED

01:24:15.950 --> 01:24:18.853
DRAMATICALLY SO I THINK THIS IS

01:24:18.920 --> 01:24:19.621
A VERY.

01:24:19.687 --> 01:24:22.791
BIG BILL NOT A LITTLE BILL SO I

01:24:22.857 --> 01:24:26.895
MOVE THE BILL FORWARD.

01:24:26.961 --> 01:24:27.529
I'M.

01:24:27.595 --> 01:24:28.997
RECENTLY I HAD A MEETING WITH

01:24:29.063 --> 01:24:29.697
LOS ANGELES CONTROLLER RUN

01:24:29.764 --> 01:24:31.699
GIRLFRIEND AND HE HAS UNDERTAKEN

01:24:31.766 --> 01:24:33.001
EXACTLY THIS WHERE THE CITY OF

01:24:33.067 --> 01:24:34.536
LOS ANGELES AND IT'S PROVING TO

01:24:34.602 --> 01:24:36.671
BE A VERY USEFUL TOOL ALREADY SO.

01:24:36.738 --> 01:24:39.007
I'M EXCITED TO SEE THIS EXPANDED

01:24:39.073 --> 01:24:39.607
AND I WILL HAPPILY SECOND THE

01:24:39.674 --> 01:24:44.879

ONE SO FAR PAUL IT TO ADDRESS

01:24:49.884 --> 01:24:51.419
THE HOUSING CRISIS BUT THIS DOES

01:24:51.486 --> 01:24:52.921
SEEM LIKE A REALLY IMPORTANT
