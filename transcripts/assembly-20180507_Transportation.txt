THIS MEETING TO ORDER. TODAY'S INFORMATIONAL HEARING WILL FOCUS ON THE SAFETY BENEFITS SOME CONCERN. AUTOMATED VEHICLES. AUTOMATED VEHICLES HAVE BEEN A DREAM OF ENGINEERS DATING BACK TO THE NINETEEN THIRTIES. GENERAL MOTORS INTRODUCED THE IDEA WITH THEIR FOOD FUTURAMA A DISPLAY AT THE NEW YORK CITY WORLD FAIR. FUTUROLA. DEPICTED A NATIONAL HIGHWAY SYSTEM THAT WOULD AUTOMATICALLY SHUFFLE CORES TO THEIR DESTINATIONS AND SHAPED OUR NATIONAL HIGHWAY SYSTEM. TRUE POTENTIAL FOR AUTOMATED CARS HAS BEEN OUT OF REACH UNTIL VERY RECENTLY. LAST YEAR OVER OVER FORTY THOUSAND PEOPLE DIED IN THE UNITED STATES DUE TO TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS. NEARLY SIX THOUSAND OF THOSE DEATHS WERE CARS STRIKING PEDESTRIANS. FURTHER THE ECONOMIC IMPACT BECAUSE MY TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS IS EQUALLY GRAVE. THE NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION ESTIMATES OF THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIETAL HARM AMOUNTS TO ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE BILLION. IN A SINGLE YEAR. HUMAN THEIR ACCOUNTS FOR OVER NINETY PERCENT OF ALL VEHICLE ACCIDENTS. AUTOMATED VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY HAS THE POTENTIAL TO SAVE THOUSANDS. OF LIVES YEARLY. HOWEVER IT MUST BE SHOWN THAT AUTOMATED VEHICLES ARE SAFER THAN HUMAN DRIVER. DESPITE THE HIGH NUMBERS OF FIGHT FATALITIES HUMAN DRIVERS HAVE SHOWN TO BE ABLE TO DRIVE MILLIONS OF HOURS. ON AVERAGE. BETWEEN FATAL ACCIDENTS. AS THIS TECHNOLOGY IS DEVELOPED IS IMPORTANT THAT AUTUMN THE AUTOMAKERS AND TECH COMPANIES PRIORITIZE. SAFETY OVER PROFITS. THE PUBLIC REMAINS VERY SKEPTICAL OF AUTOMATED VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY. IF YOU RESEARCH A PEW RESEARCH POLL FOUND THAT NEARLY SIXTY PERCENT OF AMERICANS SAY THAT WOULD NOT WANT TO RIDE IN THE DRIVERLESS. VEHICLES. SAFETY WAS THEIR MAIN CONCERN. DRIVERLESS CARS WILL SOON BE HITTING OUR ROADS. IN APRIL DMV BEGAN ACCEPTING APPLICATIONS FOR DRIVERLESS AUTOMATED VEHICLE TESTING. MANY OF THE REGULATIONS THEY HAVE DEVELOPED KEEP SAFETY IN MIND HOWEVER. SEVERAL BILLS HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED THIS SESSION TO EXEMPT PORTIONS OF THE STATE FROM SOME OF THOSE REGULATIONS. DEALING WITH SAFETY. I URGE MEMBERS TO BE CAUTIOUS WHEN INTRODUCING THESE BILLS. EVERY ACCIDENT CAUSED BY AN AUTOMATED VEHICLE ONLY INCREASED PUBLIC SCHOOL SKEPTICISM OF THE PRODUCT. A FAILURE ON THE STATE'S BEHALF TO ADDRESS SAFETY WILL ONLY REDUCE PUBLIC TRUST. WELL CALIFORNIA HAS TAKEN TO SAFETY DRIVEN APPROACH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS ASKED DAYS TO LEAVE SAFETY UP TO THEM. DESPITE THIS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS NOT ISSUED ANY REGULATIONS DEALING WITH SAFETY. TODAY'S HEARING WILL HAVE THREE PANELS. FIRST WE WILL GET. A GOVERNMENT PERSPECTIVE ON SAFETY. WITH REPRESENTS FROM THE DMV CHP. AND THE NATIONAL CONFERENCE OF STATE LEGISLATORS. NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM GROUPS DEDICATED TO THE SAFETY OF THESE VEHICLES. INCLUDING LABOR THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY. I CONSUMER GROUPS. WE WILL ALSO HEAR FROM THE ELECTRONICFRONTIER FOUNDATION ABOUT CYBERSECURITY CONCERNS. FINALLY WE'LL HEAR FROM SOME OF THE OF THE DEVELOPERS OF AUTOMATED OF VEHICLES INCLUDING GENERAL MOTORS UBER AND WAYNE. IT IS MY HOPE THAT FROM THIS HEARING THAT THE PUBLIC CAN GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ARE DOING AND SHOULD BE. DOING TO ENSURE THAT THESE VEHICLES ARE SAFE. I WAS GONNA ASK MISTER FUNG TO MAKE SOME COMMENTS BUT HE'S NOT HERE. STONER. SO I'D LIKE TO INVITE THE FIRST PANEL TO COME FORWARD. Y. YOU MAKE YOUR WAY HERE WILL DO SOME QUICK HOUSEKEEPING. I LIKE TO HAVE. ALL OF YOU AVAILABLE FOR A ROUNDTABLE DISCUSSION FONG A BRIEF PRESENT YOUR PREFERRED PRESENTATIONS. AND STAFF OF YOUR MEMBERS ARE COMING. LET'S TRY TO HOLD OFF THEIR QUESTIONS UNTIL WE GET THROUGH THE PRESENTATIONS. NOT FOR THE PUBLIC THERE WILL BE AMPLE TIME TO HEAR FROM YOU FOLLOWING THE PANEL DISCUSSION. BECAUSE I SUSPECT MANY OF YOU WILL WANT TO SPEAK AND I ASKED. YOU TO MAKE YOUR COMMENTS COMPLETE BUT SUCCINCT. AND TO THE EXTENT YOU CAN HELP US FOCUS ON THE SPECIFIC ITEMS WE WILL BE DISCUSSING TODAY THAT WOULD THAT WOULD BE VERY MUCH APPRECIATED. WITH THAT. LET'S BEGIN. WAS ENTERED ISSUES OPENLY REPRESENT. CHAIRMAN FRAZIER OCT GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY. I AM BEN HARSH WITH THE NATIONAL CONFERENCE OF STATE LEGISLATURES WHERE I SERVED AS A SENIOR POLICY DIRECTOR FOR NATURAL RESOURCES AND INFRASTRUCTURE. IN THIS POSITION I TRACK TRANSPORTATION POLICY AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND ITS POTENTIAL IMPACT ON STATES. AND CSL IS THE BIPARTISAN ORGANIZATION SERVING THE LEGISLATURE'S OF OUR NATION STATES TERRITORIES AND COMMONWEALTHS WE'VE TO OFFICES OUR HEADQUARTERS IN DENVER COLORADO. AND OUR STATE FEDERAL DIVISION IN WASHINGTON DC WHERE I'M LOCATED. AND SEE ESTAS MISSION IS THREEFOLD TO HELP IMPROVE THE QUALITY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF STATE LEGISLATURES TO PROMOTE POLICY INNOVATION AND COMMUNICATION AMONG STATE LEGISLATURES. AND TO ENSURE STATE LEGISLATURES A STRONG COHESIVE VOICE IN THE FEDERAL SYSTEM. AND LIKE TO TAKE A FEW MINUTES TO GIVE YOU AN UPDATE ON THE MOST RECENT DEVELOPMENTS REGARDING AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES UNITED STATES CONGRESS AND THE U. S. DEPARTMENT TRANSPORTATION. A LIMIT MY REMARKS. HE COGNIZANT OF MY ALLOTTED TIME BUT LOOK FORWARD QUESTIONS. THE AUTOMOBILE IS ON THE CUSP OF A TREE TECHNOLOGICAL TRANSFORMATION WITH POTENTIAL TO DELIVER IMMEASURABLE SAFETY BENEFITS REVOLUTIONIZE PERSONAL MOBILITY AND PROVIDE A SIGNIFICANT BOOST ECONOMIC GROWTH. HOWEVER THIS TRANSITION TO A FULLY AUTOMATED AND CONNECTED VEHICLE FLEET WILL TAKE MANY DECADES IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT DURING THIS INTERIM PERIOD A FRAMEWORK BE ESTABLISHED THAT BUILDS OFF THE GREAT SUCCESS OUR COUNTRY HAS HAD. OVER THE LAST HALF CENTURY IN MAKING MOTOR VEHICLE TRANSPORTATION SAFER TO ENSURE THAT WE MAXIMIZE THE BENEFITS. OF THIS TECHNOLOGY. AS MOTOR VEHICLES THAT OPERATES ON PUMP ON AS MOTOR VEHICLES THAT OPERATE ON PUBLIC ROADS ARE SUBJECT TO BOTH STATE FEDERAL AND LOCAL REGULATIONS. AND ZSL UNDERSTANDS THE NEED TO CLEAR. A CLEARLY DEFINED STATE AND FEDERAL AS WELL AS AVOID UNNECESSARY FEDERAL PREEMPTION AND BURDENSOME FEDERAL MANDATES. I'D LIKE TO START WITH A QUICK OVERVIEW OF RECENT ACTIONS BY THE NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION OR NHTSA AS OUR FOR IT. IN SEPTEMBER TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN NHTSA RELEASED A GUIDANCE DOCUMENT ENTITLED AUTOMATED DRIVING SYSTEMS OR EDS TO POINT OUT A VISION FOR SAFETY. AS YOU CAN LIKELY TELL BY ITS NAME. THIS WAS THE AGENCIES SECOND ITERATION OF ITS AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE GUIDANCE THIS WAS THE FIRST WAS RELEASED BY NETS UP UNDER PRESIDENT OBAMA IN SEPTEMBER TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. VERSION TWO POINT OH CAN BEST BE SUMMARIZED IN ONE WORD VOLUNTARY. THROUGHOUT THE DOCUMENT NHTSA HIGHLIGHTS THAT THAT IT INCLUDES NO MANDATES OR REQUIREMENTS THIS IS BEST EXEMPLIFIED BY THE CLOSING PARAGRAPH OF ITS SCOPE AND PURPOSE SECTION WHICH STATES. THIS VOLUNTARY GUIDANCE PROVIDES RECOMMENDATIONS AND SUGGESTIONS FOR THE INDUSTRY'S CONSIDERATION AND DISCUSSION THIS GUIDANCE IS ENTIRELY VOLUNTARY WITH NO COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS OR ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM. THE SOLE PURPOSE OF THIS GUIDANCE IS TO SUPPORT INDUSTRY AS IT DEVELOPS BEST PRACTICES IN THE DESIGN DEVELOPMENT TESTING AND DEPLOYMENT OF AUTOMATED VEHICLE TECHNOLOGIES. THIS THEME IS FURTHER AMPLIFIED BY NHTSA'S INCLUSION OF A VOLUNTARY SAFETY SELF ASSESSMENT OR V. S. S. A. FOR ENTITIES ENGAGED IN AUTOMATED DRIVING SYSTEM TESTING AND DEPLOYMENT. IN IT'S IS VIEW A V. SSA. WOULD DEMONSTRATE TO THE PUBLIC THAT ENTITIES ARE ONE CONSIDERING THE SAFETY ASPECTS OF ATS IS. TO COMMUNICATING AND COLLABORATING WITH THE US DEPARTMENT TRANSPORTATION THREE ENCOURAGING BE SELF ESTABLISHMENT OF INDUSTRY SAFETY NORMS AND FOR BUILDING PUBLIC TRUST ACCEPTANCE AND CONFIDENCE THROUGH TRANSPARENT TESTING AND DEPLOYMENT OF ATS IS. HOWEVER ENTITIES ARE NOT REQUIRED TO SUBMIT A VOLUNTARY SAFETY SELF ASSESSMENT NOR IS pENTITIES TO DO SO WHICH NCSL FEELS MAY MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO ENSURE THAT THESE VEHICLES. ARE AS SAFE AS CURRENT STANDARDS REQUIRE TO DATE ONLY TWO ENTITIES WAY MO AND GENERAL MOTORS HAVE SUBMITTED PSSAS. WELL THAT'S A HAS NOT YET ENACTED ANY RULES OR REQUIREMENTS SPECIFIC TO AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES BE EXISTING FEDERAL SAFETY STANDARDS FOR PASSENGER MOTOR VEHICLES KNOWN AS FEDERAL MOTOR VEHICLE SAFETY STANDARDS STILL APPLY. IT IS THESE FMVSS THAT HAVE HELPED TO DEFINE THE DUAL ROLE THAT FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT PLAY IN INSURING ROADWAY SAFETY. WITH NETS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING SAFETY OF THE VEHICLE ITSELF AND STATES AND LOCALITIES RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THE SAFE OPERATION OF THAT VEHICLE ON PUBLIC ROADWAYS. HOWEVER THE MOTOR VEHICLE SAFETY ACT NINETEEN SIXTY SIX. ESTABLISH THE AUTHORITY OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO SET FEDERAL MOTOR VEHICLE SAFETY STANDARDS AND THE CORRESPONDING PREEMPTION OF STATE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. ONLY LIMITS IS PREEMPTION TO THOSE AREAS COVERED BY EXISTING FEDERAL MOTOR VEHICLE SAFETY STANDARD. THE COMBINATION OF THIS LEGAL DYNAMIC AND THE LACK OF ANY AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES SPECIFIC FEDERAL SAFETY STANDARDS HAS CREATED A SITUATION WHERE STATES OF ACTED TO ENSURE THAT EARLY STATE AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES. BEING TESTED ON THEIR PUBLIC ROADWAYS ARE IN FACT SAFE. UNSURPRISINGLY THE AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY HAS RESPONDED TO THE POTENTIAL FOR VARIANCES IN SAFETY STANDARDS WITH A CALL TO CONGRESS TO ESTABLISH AN INTERIM FRAMEWORK FOR THE DEPLOYMENT OF SELF DRIVING TECHNOLOGY BEFORE IS MATURE ENOUGH TO ENABLE SPECIFIC NEW FEDERAL SAFETY STANDARDS. THE START OF THE HUNDRED FIFTEEN CONGRESS THE HOUSE ENERGY AND COMMERCE BEGAN ITS ATTEMPT TO ESTABLISH AN INTERIM FEDERAL FRAMEWORK WITH THE SAFELY ENSURING LIVES FUTURE DEPLOYMENT AND RESEARCH IN VEHICLE EVOLUTION. OR THE SELF DRIVE ACT. THE COMMITTEE APPROVED THE BILL IN JULY TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN FOLLOWED BY APPROVAL BY THE FULL U. S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES IN SEPTEMBER OF LAST YEAR. THE BILL AIMS TO ESTABLISH THIS INTERIM FRAMEWORK BY FIRST IDENTIFYING THE PRIMARY STATE AND FEDERAL ROLES AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE REGULATION. REQUIRING THE DEVELOPMENT BY DOT OF A SAFETY ASSURANCE CERTIFICATION FOR THOSE ENTITIES OPERATING AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES ON PUBLIC ROADWAYS. FORMULATING A PLAN THAT BEGINS THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING NEW FEDERAL MOTOR VEHICLE SAFETY STANDARDS FOR AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES. PROVIDING DEAR TV AUTHORITY TO ISSUE MOTOR VEHICLE MANUFACTURERS EXEMPTIONS FROM SPECIFIC EXISTING SAFETY STANDARDS AND FIVE REQUIRING THE CREATION OF SEPARATE CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY PLANS BY THOSE ENTITIES SEEKING TO INTRODUCE AND AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE FOR COMMERCIAL SALE. NCSL AND MANY OTHER NATIONAL ASSOCIATIONS EPRESENTING STATE OFFICIALS INCLUDING THE NATIONAL GOVERNORS ASSOCIATION THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF MOTOR VEHICLE ADMINISTRATORS. THE GOVERNORS HIGHWAY SAFETY ASSOCIATION AND THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF STATE HIGHWAY AND TRANSPORTATION OFFICIALS PUBLICLY OPPOSE THIS BILL. THE OPPOSITION IS BASED ON UNCLEAR DELINEATION OF STATE AND FEDERAL ROLES AND REGULATING AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES AND OUR BELIEF THAT THE SAFETY ASSURANCE CERTIFICATION REQUIRED PRIOR TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF FEDERAL SAFETY STANDARDS WOULD NOT IN FACT PROVIDE THE NECESSARY SAFETY ASSURANCES. SOME WHAT SIMULTANEOUSLY OVER THE COURSE OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE SENATE COMMERCE SCIENCE AND TRANSPORTATION DIVISION DEVELOPED THE AMERICAN VISION FOR SAFER TRANSPORTATION THROUGH ADVANCEMENT OF REVOLUTIONARY TECHNOLOGIES OR A. B. START ACT. WELL THE GOALS OF THE BILL ARE SIMILAR TO THAT OF SELF DRIVE ACT. AB START INCLUDE SLIGHT DIFFERENCES FIRST TO IDENTIFY THE PRIMARY STATE AND FEDERAL ROLES AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE REGULATION BUT LIMITS THE AREAS UNDER FEDERAL CONTROL. REQUIRED THE SUBMISSION OF THE SAFETY EVALUATION REPORT FOR THOSE ENTITIES OPERATING AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES ON PUBLIC ROADWAYS. DEVELOP AN UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE CURRENT FEDERAL MOTOR VEHICLE SAFETY STANDARDS PERTAIN TO HUMAN OPERATORS AND ESTABLISH A TIME. FOR NHTSA TO BEGIN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING NEW FEDERAL SAFETY STANDARDS FOR AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES. PROVIDE DOT WITH NEW AND EXPANDED AUTHORITY TO ISSUE MOTOR VEHICLE MANUFACTURER EXEMPTIONS FROM SPECIFIC EXISTING SAFETY STANDARDS. AND TO CREATE A HIGHLY AUTOMATED VEHICLES ADVISORY COMMITTEE WITH RESPONSIBILITY TO PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS TO U. S. DEITY SECRETARY. FOLLOWING STEPS FOLLOWING NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE COMMITTEE NCSL ALONG WITH MANY OF THE SAME STATE ORGANIZATIONS REFERENCE EARLIER. FELT THAT THE AB START AX APPROACH APPROPRIATELY CONTINUES THE EXISTING LIMITED FEDERAL PREEMPTION OF MOTOR VEHICLES BY RESTRICTING THE AREAS OF FEDERAL PREEMPTION TO THE SUBJECT MATTERS SPECIFICALLY CONTAINED IN A SAFETY EVALUATION REPORT. THERE FOR THEREBY PRESERVING THE HISTORICAL FEDERAL PARTNERSHIP WITH STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. THE AB START ACT. PASSED THE COMMITTEE IN OCTOBER ALTHOUGH THE FULL SENATE HAS YET TO TAKE IT ON THE FLOOR. WHILE THE REASONS FOR THIS ARE EVER CHANGING I WOULD BE REMISS IF I DID NOT NOTE THAT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT BOTH UNITED STATES SENATORS REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA ALONG WITH A FEW ADDITIONAL MEMBERS. ARE CURRENTLY WITHHOLDING THEIR SUPPORT OF THIS BILL PENDING ADDITIONAL CHANGES. TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE THESE CONCERNS INCLUDE BUT MAY NOT BE LIMITED TO. ESTABLISHING A SUNSET PERIOD FOR THE BILL IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THE PREEMPTION AND SAFETY FRAMEWORK ESTABLISHED IS AN INTERIM FRAMEWORK. PACIFIC LEE STATING THAT THE PREEMPTION CLAUSE DO NOT INTERFERE WITH STATE AND LOCAL TRAFFIC LOS. FURTHER REFINING THE NEW EXEMPTS THE EXEMPTION PROCESS. ESTABLISHING A SCHEDULE FOR THE FORMAL DEVELOPMENT OF CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY SAFEGUARDS. AND EXPANDING THE APPLICABILITY OF THEIR SAFETY EVALUATION REPORT TO ALL AUTOMATED VEHICLES NOT JUST HIGHLY AUTOMATED VEHICLES. IT REMAINS UNCLEAR IF THE SENATE'S BILL SPONSORS AND THOSE MEMBERS WITH THE ABOVE CONCERNS WILL BE ABLE TO RECONCILE. AND ADVANCE THE BILL TO THE FLOOR. FURTHERMORE SHOULD THE SENATE BE ABLE TO PASS THE AB START ACT IT WOULD THEN HAVE TO BE RECONCILED WITH THE HOUSE BILL. HOWEVER I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT ANY BILL WILL LIKELY HAVE MUCH MORE IN COMMON WITH THE SENATE A. B. START ACT. AGAIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY AND I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS. I THINK YOU WILL DO LITTLE ROUND ROBIN AFTER EVERYBODY'S. JEAN MICHEL. GOOD AFTERNOON I CHAIRMAN FRAZIER AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THIS COMMITTEE I'M JUNE CHIMO THE DIRECTOR THAT PART MOTOR VEHICLES WITH ME TODAY. IS BERNARD STORY ON WHO'S IN CHARGE OF THE THOMAS VEHICLE PROGRAM FOR THE DEPARTMENT. WE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BRIEF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS ON THE DEPARTMENT'S EFFORTS REGARDED THOMAS VEHICLES. THE DEPARTMENT OF VEHICLES BEGAN WORKING ON A TOSS VEHICLES. IN TWENTY THIRTEEN AFTER THE PATCHES OF SENATE BILL TWELVE NINETY EIGHT THAT LEGISLATION REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT ABOUT REGULATIONS ALLOW YOU TOSS VEHICLES. TO BE TESTED IN OPERATE ON CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC ROADS. COMPANIES WERE DEVELOPED THIS TECHNOLOGY AND NEED TO TEST THEIR VEHICLES ON PUBLIC ROADWAYS GIVEN THE DEPARTMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY OF ENSURING SAFETY OF THE VOTING PUBLIC. WE HAD TO STRIKE A BALANCE BETWEEN ENCOURAGING INNOVATION AND ADDRESSING PUBLIC SAFETY CONCERNS. THE DEPARTMENT OF AYE THE TASK INTO DISTINCT PARTS THE FIRST PIECE WAS THE MANUFACTURES ESTING REGULATIONS WHICH DEPARTMENT COMPLETED IN SEPTEMBER TWENTY FOURTEEN. IN DEVELOPING THE REGULATIONS WE WORK OF THEIR PART AGENCIES NAMELY THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL CALTRANS THE OFFICE OF TRAFFIC SAFETY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH WE DEPART INSURANCE. THE CALIFORNIA STATE TRANSPORTATION AGENCY AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SPECIFICALLY THE NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION NHTSA. THOSE REGULATIONS CREATED A FRAMEWORK FOR THE SAFE TESTING A TIMES VEHICLES ON PUBLIC ROADS WITH THE TEST DRIVER BEHIND THE WHEEL. THIS IS DONE THROUGH SEVERAL REQUIREMENTS THAT COMPANIES NEED TO MEET INCLUDING HAVING TESTED THE VEHICLE IN CONTROLLED CONDITIONS PRIVATE TESTING ON PUBLIC ROADS. HAVING YOU TRAIN SAFETY DRIVER IN THE VEHICLE. REPORT YEARLY MILES DRIVEN ON PUBLIC ROADS AND THE NUMBER OF TIMES AND REASONS FOR WHICH A TOSS DRIVE TO TECHNOLOGY WAS DISENGAGED. REPORT ALL CRASHES WITHIN TEN DAYS OF THEIR CURRENTS AND IF ANNOUNCER SPOTS ABILITY REQUIREMENT OF FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. THERE ARE CURRENTLY FIFTY TWO COMPANIES APPROVED A TESTER TAAS VEHICLES IN CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC ROADS THESE COMPANIES INCLUDE TRADITIONAL AUTOMAKERS EDGES GM FORD NISSAN AND BMW. NEW AUTOMAKERS SUCH AS TEST LENDS UC'S AUTOMOTIVE SUPPLIER COMPANIES SUCH AS BOSTON CONTINENTAL. TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES JUST WAY MARK WELCOME NVIDIA. MULTINATIONAL CONGLOMERATES SUCH AS SAMPSON AND SMALL START UP COMPANIES IN SILICON VALLEY. COMPANIES OF ALL SIZES AND DISCIPLINES ARE IT'S IN DEVELOPMENT TIMES VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY. AND THEY'RE DOING THAT HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THE NEXT STEP AND BE DMV'S PROCESS WILL DEVELOP REGULATIONS FOR TESTING AND DEPLOYMENT COMPLETE DRIVERLESS VEHICLES. THIS MEANS VEHICLES THAT DO NOT NEED A HUMAN IN THE VEHICLE TO BE READY TO TAKE OVER CONTROL. AS WITH THE RESULT AS A REGULATIONS THE DEPARTMENT EMPLOYEES REGULATIONS WITH SAFETY AND MINE. AS PART OF THIS FOCUS ON SAFETY THE REGULATIONS RECOGNIZE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR SETTING AND ENFORCING COMPLIANCE WITH SAFETY STANDARDS FOR MOTOR VEHICLES. THE REGULATIONS REQUIRE MANUFACTURERS TO CERTIFY THEIR VEHICLES MEET FEDERAL MOTOR VEHICLE SAFETY STANDARDS A PROVIDE EVIDENCE OF AN APPROVED EXEMPTION FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SUCH AS NOT HAVING A STEEL WHEEL OR BRAKE PEDAL. IN ADDITION IN THEIR APPLICATION FOR A DRIVERLESS TESTING PERMIT MANUFACTURES MUST CERTIFY THAT THOMASVILLE HAS BEEN TESTED UNDER CONTROLLED CONDITIONS THAT'S TO SIMULATE. THE ENVIRONMENT WHERE THE TIMES BILL WILL BE DEPLOYED IN OPERATE SAFELY. THAT THOMAS VEHICLE POSSESSES A TWO WAY COMMUNICATION LINK WITH THE REMOTE OPERATOR. THAT THERE IS A PROCESS TO DISPLAY A COMMUNICATE VEHICLE OWNER OR OPERATOR INFORMATION TO LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER. THAT REMOTE OPERATORS HAVE COMPLETED SUFFICIENT TRAINING TO SAFELY EXECUTE DUTIES AND PROPER POSSESS A PROPER CLASS OF LICENSE WITH A VEHICLE BEING OPERATED. AND THAT THE PASSENGERS THAT ARE NOT EMPLOYEES OR CONTRACTORS THE MANUFACTURES WILL BE NOTIFIED OF WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION IF ANY. MAY BE COLLECTED AND HOW THE NEWS. MANY FACTORS MUST ALSO PROVIDE THE DEPARTMENT WITH EVIDENCE OF FIVE MEN DOLLARS INSURANCE A COPY OF THE WRITTEN NOTIFICATION TO LOCAL AUTHORITIES. DESCRIBING THE TESTING PROGRAM AND A COPY OF LAW ENFORCEMENT INTERACTION INTERACTION PLAN. BEYOND THIS AN APPLICATION FOR A PERMIT TO DEPLOY REQUIRES THAT THE TIMES TO BE DESIGNED TO BE CAPABLE OPERATE. IN A TOSS LOW IN IN AREAS OUTSIDE DISCLOSE OPERATING ENVIRONMENT. TAUZIAT TECHNOLOGY DESIGNED TO DETECT AND RESPOND TO ROADWAY SITUATIONS AND COMPLIES WITH ALL PROVISIONS OF THE CALIFORNIA VEHICLE CODE. WHEN NECESSARY UPDATES TO THOMAS TECHNOLOGY I MAY AT LEAST ANDREA BY THE FACT TO DATE OF ANY CHANGES. IN THE CALIFORNIA VEHICLE CODE AND LOCAL REGULATION. THE TIMES VEHICLE LET'S MEET CURRENT INDUSTRY STANDARDS TO HELP DEFEND AGAINST DETECT AND RESPOND TO CYBER ATTACKS. UNAUTHORIZED INTRUSIONS ARE FALSE FEEL CONCURRENT CONTROL COMMANDS. ANY IDENTIFIED STATE REALLY A DEFECT OF TOM'S TECHNOLOGY THAT CREATES AN UNREASONABLE RISK TO SAFETY WILL BE SIMILAR TO THE DEPARTMENT. AND THE MANUFACTURE OF LESS PROVIDED DESCRIPTION HOW THE VEHICLE DESIGNED TO REACT WHEN IT'S OUTSIDE IT'S OPERATING ENVIRONMENT. RECOUNTED THE CONDITIONS IN WHICH IT IS UNABLE TO OPERATE RELIABLY IN A THOMAS MODE. A CONSUMER AND USE IT EDUCATION PLAN A DESCRIPTION OF HOW TIMES VEHICLES SAFELY COME TO A COMPLETE STOP WHEN THERE IS AN A THOMAS TECHNOLOGY FAILURE. THESE REGULATIONS BECAME EFFECTIVE ON APRIL FIRST TWENTY EIGHTEEN. COMPANIES NOW HAVE THE ABILITY TEST EMPLOYED OF FULLY THOMAS VEHICLES ON CALPERS POLLUTE ROAD RACE AFTER RECEIVING A PERMIT FROM THE DEPARTMENT. CALIFORNIA'S AT THE STEREOTYPICAL YOU'D ADVANCEMENT PRETTY ALL THE AUTOMAKERS HAVE A PRESENCE IN SILICON VALLEY. WITH THE STATE'S OFFER TELL ECONOMIC STRENGTH THOMAS VEHICLES ARE BEING DEVELOPED HERE AND WILL BE DEPLOYED HERE. DOES VEHICLES HOLD THE PROMISE OF THE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM THAT IS SAFE AND PROVIDES MOBILE MOBILITY CALIFORNIANS. ALSO HAS THESE VEHICLES MAKE THEIR WAY INTO OUR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM WE NEED TO BE PREPARED FOR WORLD WHERE TRADITIONAL VEHICLES. AND TOSS VEHICLE SHARE THE ROAD. BUT BEFORE THIS BECOMES A REALITY THE PUBLIC MUST BE ACCEPTING THE PUBLIC OPINION FOR SUCH A MIXTURE OF ENTHUSIASM AND SKEPTICISM REGARDING THESE VEHICLES. DRIVERS NEED TO BE EDUCATE ABOUT THE CAPABILITIES AND LIMITATIONS OF A TOSS VEHICLES. COMPANIES NEED TO DEVELOP VEHICLES THAT DELIVER ON THE PROMISE THIS TECHNOLOGY BRINGS AND GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO ENABLE THE TECHNOLOGY FLORES WHILE ALSO ADDRESSING PUBLIC SAFETY CONCERNS. ALL THIS NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AS MOVE FORWARD WHERE TRADITIONAL VEHICLES AND AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES MUST COEXIST. WHILE DAVID'S REGULATION PROVIDE A PATH FOR THE TESTING DEPLOYMENT BATONS VEHICLES WE RECOGNIZE THAT THOMAS VEHICLES ALSO SPUR. A BRIAR POLICY DISCUSSION ON TOPICS OUTSIDE THE DEPARTMENT SAFETY FOCUS THESE QUESTIONS AND MANY MORE WILL BE NEED TO BE DISCUSSED BY OTHER PUBLIC AGENCIES INDUSTRY ACADEMIA. INTERESTED PARTIES AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS AT THE THOMASVILLE TECHNOLOGY CONTINUES TO ADVANCE. COLLECTIVELY WE CAN FOSTER THIS A TECHNOLOGIST CONTINUES TO DEVELOP IN CALIFORNIA IN A SAFE AND RESPONSIBLE MANNER. IS TRULY EXCITING FOR THE DEPARTMENT INVOLVED IN BECAUSE YOU COULD GET VEHICLES AS WILK TRANSFER SOCIETY. WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THE INTERESTS AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THINK YOU WOULDN'T OF FINNISH AUTHOR WOODMAN ORDER YOU. PREPARED OF. ARTISTS BERNARD SORIANO FROM THE DMV ACTING JEAN SAID IT ALSO WILL MOVE ON TO THE CHP. OKAY. SYSTEM CHIEF. THANK YOU FOR YIELDING A TIME TO CGPA APPRECIATE THAT A. GOOD AFTERNOON. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS RICH HAS BEEN ON THE. CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL'S LEGISLATIVE LACE ON A FIRST ONE APOLOGIZE I COMMISSIONER STANLEY WAS NOT ABLE TO MAKE IT TODAY YOU WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE BEEN HERE WITH A. MEMORIAL THIS MORNING IS YOUR WHERE OF UNEASE WAS SPENDING TIME WITH THE. WITH THE FAMILIES OF THE VICTIMS. BUT WITH WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOU INCLUDING US TO BE INCLUDING US IN THIS HEARING TODAY LAW ENFORCEMENT'S NOT HAD A SEAT AT THE TABLE HAVING PRIOR HEARINGS WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE CHANCE TO GIVE YOU CAN A LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSPECTIVE. AND HOPEFULLY I CAN DO THAT AS DIRECTOR SHE MOTOR MENTIONED. WE'VE BEEN WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THE DMV SINCE. TWENTY THIRTEEN TO PROVIDE INPUT ON TRAFFIC SAFETY ISSUES WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO AS NEW ISSUES ARISE. SAFETY IS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING FOR THE OUR PATROL TRAFFIC SAFETY ON THE ROADWAYS AND THAT'S THE LENS THROUGH WHICH WE LOOK AT EVERYTHING. AND SOME ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES THOUGH THE LAW ENFORCEMENT FACES NOT ONLY CHP BUT CERTAINLY OUR LOCAL ALLIED AGENCY PARTNERS. WHO WILL PROBABLY BE EXPERIENCING AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES MORE THAN CHP OFFICERS FRANKLY ARE OR THE UNCERTAINTY OF THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY? HOW IT'S BEING USED? IT'S SO RAPID AND IT'S RAPIDLY DEVELOPING AND IT'S IT'S FOR A LOT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS OUT THERE ON THE ROAD THEY DON'T KNOW A WHOLE LOT ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON TODAY. ANOTHER BIG CHALLENGE IS A STATUTORY CHALLENGES PHIL TALK ABOUT EACH OF THESE IN TURN FIRST FALL WITH WITH RESPECT TO THE UNCERTAINTY. WHAT IS HAPPENING NOW WE AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN WHAT IT WHAT ARE THEY ALLOWED TO DO? WHAT ARE THEY REQUIRED TO DO ON THE ROADWAYS WHAT DOES LAW ENFORCEMENT DO IF THEY IN IRAQ ONE OF THESE AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES AS A RESULT OF THE CALL OF A COLLISION? OR MAYBE AN ENFORCEMENT CAPACITY HOW THEY HANDLE THAT. CERTAINLY THE HIGHWAY PATROL BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN WORKING SO CLOSELY WITH THE DMV WE HAVE A GOOD SENSE OF THE NEW REGULATORY STRUCTURE BUT ARE A LOT OF RALLIED AGENCY PARTNERS DON'T. IT'S WHITE HEARINGS LIKE THIS I THINK ARE SO CRUCIAL FOR THE LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY CERTAINLY HERE. IN COORDINATION WITH THE AND WE WE HAVE HAD SEVERAL DISCUSSIONS WITH OUR ALLIED AGENCY PARTNERS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE EIGHTIES. WHAT IS COMING AND OTHER SCHOOLS RESPOND TO THEM? SOME GOOD ELEMENTS OF THE DMV ROUTE REGULATIONS THAT WILL CERTAINLY HELP LAW ENFORCEMENT AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT PARTNERS OUR INFORMATION THAT AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE MANUFACTURERS WHO HAVE A PERMIT. AFTER PROVIDE TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS INCLUDING LAW ENFORCEMENT ABOUT WHERE VEHICLES ARE BEING TESTED IN OTHER WORDS WHAT WHAT. WHAT ROADWAYS ARE BEING TESTED ON WHAT TYPES OF VEHICLES? WHEN THEY WILL BE USED THE NUMBER OF VEHICLES THAT WILL BE TESTED THAT INFORMATION IS IS CRUCIAL FOR FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO HAVE. ANOTHER BIG THING FOR LAW FOR SOME PROBLEM MOST SIGNIFICANT ASPECT OF THE DMV REGULATIONS FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT IS THE. REQUIREMENT OF A LAW ENFORCEMENT OR ACTION PLAN THAT MANUFACTURES MUST THIS MUST SUBMIT. THE REGULATIONS REQUIRE. THIS INFORMATION TO BE SAID TO A LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. INCLUDING CHP ALLIED AGENCIES FAR DEPARTMENTS AND EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES. BEFORE TESTING BEGINS IN IN ANY AREA MATTER FACT I WORKED FOR RIGHT NOW WE ARE REVIEWING A LAW ENFORCEMENT PROPOSED LAW PERSON INTERACTION PLAN THAT WE'VE RECEIVED. THE. INTERACTION PLANS SHALL INCLUDE INFORMATION ABOUT HOW TO IN IRAQ DURING ENFORCEMENT EMERGENCY SITUATION AND SOME OF THE COMPONENTS OF THE PLANS INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO THE FOLLOWING. HOW TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE REMOTE OPERATOR OF A VEHICLE OF AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES WHERE IN THE VEHICLE TO OBTAIN THE REGISTRATION AND INSURANCE SAY FOR INSTANCE? LAW ENFORCEMENT MAKES AN ENFORCEMENT STOP ON AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE OR IN AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES INVOLVED IN THE IN A COLLISION. CRUCIAL BATTLE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER BILL TO GET THIS REGISTERED OWNER INFORMATION INSURANCE INFORMATION FROM THE VEHICLE. HOW TO IDENTIFY IF THE VEHICLES IN AUTONOMOUS MODE MODE AND HOW TO SAFELY DISENGAGED THE AUTONOMOUS MODE YOU CAN IMAGINE A CONCERN FOR LAW PERSON ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD IS OKAY? IF I STOP THIS AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE OF THIS VEHICLES BEEN INVOLVED IN A COLLISION WHAT ASSURANCE DO I HAVE THAT IT'S GONNA REMAIN STOPPED AND THAT KIND OF INFORMATION IS INCLUDED IN THE LAW ENFORCEMENT INTERACTION PLAN THAT MANUFACTURERS HAVE TO SUBMIT. ARE ALSO OUT OF THE TECH CAN ENSURE THAT THE AUTONOMOUS MODE IS DEACTIVATED. THIS ANOTHER VERY. IMPORTANT PRACTICAL PIECE OF INFORMATION FOR AN OFFICER TO HAVE BECAUSE YOU CAN IMAGINE THE LEVEL THREE AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE WHERE SOMEONE IS BEHIND THE WHEEL WE NEED TO FIND OUT IF THE PERSON WAS ACTUALLY DRIVING THE VEHICLE IN CONTROLLED VEHICLE OR FOR WAS IN AUTONOMOUS MODE. SO I THINK THOUGH THAT INFORMATION IS IS OBVIOUSLY VERY IMPORTANT FOR FOR TRAFFIC SAFETY BUT ALSO IMPORTANT TO HELP LAW ENFORCEMENT UNDERSTAND WHAT THESE VEHICLES CAN DO AND WHAT THE. OFFICERS WILL DO WHEN THEY INTERACT WITH. THESE LAW ENFORCEMENT ACTION PLANS SHALL BE REVIEWED AND UPDATED AS CHANGES ARE NEEDED. WITHIN TEN DAYS OF APPROVAL THE TESTING APPLICATION THEY'LL BE POSTED ON THE SEAT PIECE WEBSITE THE TO BE NEED TO BE POSTED AS WELL ON THE MANUFACTURER'S WEBSITE SO THERE TILL THE VERY ACCESSIBLE. NOW THE OTHER BIG CHALLENGE WE HAD THAT I REFERENCED IS A STATUTORY CHALLENGE WE HAVE. CALIFORNIA'S YOU CODE WAS NOT WRITTEN WITH AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES IN MIND I THINK HE'LL KNOW THAT AND. WE'VE SPENT A LOT OF TIME OVER THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS IN CONSULTATION WITH. DEPARTMENT VEHICLES AND THE ADMINISTRATION LOOKING AT THE VEHICLE CODE AND HOW TO APPLY HOW WE APPLY THE CURRENT STATUTORY SCHEME TO AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES AND WE THINK WE HAVE A GOOD PLAN WE THINK WE HAVE. VERY GOOD APPLICATION WE CAN ENSURE TRAFFIC SAFETY BY GETTING VEHICLES OFF THE ROAD BY ISSUING ENFORCEMENT APPROPRIATE FORSMAN DOCUMENTATION TO. MANUFACTURERS ARE OPERATORS OF AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES IF NECESSARY. THE LEGISLATURE ALSO PASSED IN THE GOVERNOR SIGNED SOME SPECIFIC NEW. LEGISLATION RELATING TO AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES. VIEW CODE SECTION THIRTY EIGHT SEVEN FIFTY. BE TOO REQUIRES. OF LEVEL THREE AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE IF SOMEONE IS NOT IN THE DRIVER SEAT AND NOT MONITORING AND NOT CABLE OF TAKING CONTROL THAT'S A NEW INFRACTION. IF WE ENCOUNTER THAT ALSO IN THAT SAME SECTION IT REALLY. PROHIBITS A MANUFACTURER FROM TESTING WITHOUT PROPER INSURANCE AND LICENSE THERE'S ANOTHER SECTION WHICH PROHIBITS THE OPERATION OF AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES ON THE ROADWAYS WITHOUT AN APPROVED DMB APPLICATIONS OF. THE LEGISLATURE HAS ALREADY ACTED THE MINISTRATIONS ALREADY. APPROVED SOME LEGISLATION THAT IS VERY HELPFUL IN THIS AREA. SOMETHING ELSE WERE DRAWING UPON WITH THIS WILL STATUTORY ISSUE IS IS EXPERIENCES AND OTHER STATES YOU'VE SEEN SOME VERY HIGH PROFILE INCIDENTS OFFICE INVOLVING AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES. VEHICLES WITH DRIVER ASSIST TECHNOLOGY AS WELL AND AW ENFORCEMENT CLEAN THE HIGHWAY PATROL WE'VE WORKED OUR WAY THROUGH SOME OF THESE IN MANY CASES. ITS DRIVER ASSIST TECHNOLOGY AND THE DRIVER IS STILL FIRMLY IN CONTROL AND RESPONSIBLE FOR EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS IN THAT VEHICLE SO SO ENFORCEMENT ACTION WE TAKE ISRAEL IS RELATIVELY CLEAR IN THOSE SITUATIONS. SOMETHING ELSE THE CHP IS DOING IS IS WE HAVE A REPRESENTATIVE ON WORKING GROUP'S FOR NHTSA AND. THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION ASSOCIATION OF MOTOR VEHICLE ADMINISTRATORS. OUR EXPERIENCES THAT WE'RE SEEING OUT ON THE ROAD AND OUR INVOLVEMENT IN THESE WORKING GROUPS WILL HELP INFORM. I THINK THE INVOLVEMENT WE HAVE WITH D. M. V. AND THE DISCUSSIONS WE ARE HAVING WITH THE MINISTRATION AND YOU'LL BE ON ON. POSSIBLY LOOKING AREAS WHERE THE VEHICLE CODE NEEDS TO BE MORE FOCUSED TO ADDRESS AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE ISSUES. I'M AS A NUMBER OF AB IS ON THE ROAD TO MULTIPLY IN THE USES EXPAND WE WILL CONTINUE TO DRAW ON THIS EXPERIENCE IN OUR INVOLVEMENT TO AUTO INSURER TRAFFIC SAFETY ON THE ROADWAYS. AND WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY. THANK YOU WILL MOVE ON TO JD THEM WILL HAVE A ROUND OF QUESTIONS. GOOD AFTERNOON CHORE FRAZIER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS JUDY RUSSELL CHO AND I'M THE STATE AND FEDERAL LEGISLATIVE ANALYST WITH THE SAN FRANCISCO MUNICIPAL TRANSPORTATION AGENCY. OR A SEVENTY EIGHT. I'M I'M PLEASED TO BE HERE THIS AFTERNOON TO SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES AND PUBLIC SAFETY AND ISSUE THAT IS OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE TO SAN FRANCISCO. CITIES LIKE SAN FRANCISCO ALREADY HAVE COMPANIES TESTING IF HE'S ON OUR STREETS. WHILE WAITING FOR THE BUS THE SATURDAY AFTERNOON I WATCHED NAVY CIRCLE MY BLOCK THREE TIMES. AND THEN YOU KNOW MANEUVER ITS WAY AROUND AND IF WE REALLY MADE ME REALIZE YOU KNOW THIS IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW AND IT'S ON THE GROUNDS. PROPOSED FEDERAL LEGISLATION COULD ALLOW THE EACH MANUFACTURER DEPLOY UP TO EIGHTY THOUSAND AV'S AND OVER THE COURSE OF THREE YEARS. MANY OF WHICH WE EXPECT IN URBAN AREAS LIKE SAN FRANCISCO. TODAY PUBLIC ATTENTION CONCERNING AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES IS FOCUSED ON THE VEHICLE ITSELF. MORE THOUGHT MUST BE GIVEN TO THE ENVIRONMENT OF THESE VEHICLES WILL OPERATE AND AND THE PEOPLE THAT ARE AROUND THEM. WITH AV IS WE FEEL LIKE WE HAVE A ONCE IN A LIFETIME OPPORTUNITY TO RETHINK OUR STREETS. TO ADDRESS CRITICAL ISSUES LIKE TRAFFIC SAFETY CONGESTION MOBILITY AND EQUITY. AS A MANAGER OF ALL GROUND TRANSPORTATION IN SAN FRANCISCO THAT'S OF MTA IS CHARGED WITH OVERSEEING A SAFE EFFECTIVE AND SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM. WE SUPPORT INNOVATION AND BELIEVES AND THE LONG TERM AUTOMATION CAN REALLY HELP REDUCE A LOT OF THE DANGEROUS DRIVING BEHAVIORS THAT WE SEE ON THE STREETS. AB IS COMMITTED TO HELP US ACHIEVE SEVERAL HORSES CITIES GUIDING TRANSPORTATION POLICY IS INCLUDING VISION ZERO OUR EFFORTS AND ALL TRAFFIC FATALITIES ON CITY STREETS. AS WELL AS OUR TRANSIT FIRST POLICY WHICH PRIORITIZES MASS TRANSIT WALKING AND BIKING OVER SINGLE OCCUPANCY VEHICLE TRIPS. WE SEE THE POTENTIAL FOR AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES BUT ONLY IF REGULATED CORRECTLY. A PROACTIVE STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT ROLE IN SAFEGUARDING THE PUBLIC INTEREST IS CRUCIAL. WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF AB IS ON OUR STREETS. OPPOSES A VARIETY OF ISSUES FOR A CITY MUST BUT A CITY MUST CONSIDER BUT TODAY WILL FOCUS ON SAFETY. THE TRAGIC FATALITY IN ARIZONA HAS BROUGHT THIS ISSUE TO THE FRONT OF ALL OF OUR MINDS. AND THE REALITY THAT A THESE ARE NOT A SILVER BULLET TO SAFETY WITHOUT FURTHER TESTING AND THOUGHTFUL REGULATION HAS BECOME APPARENT. WITH A POTENTIALLY SWIFT PACE OF INTRODUCTION OF EIGHTIES ON OUR CITY STREETS WE BELIEVE THE MANUFACTURERS NEED TO WORK CLOSELY WITH CITIES TO ENSURE THAT THE FIRST AB IS DEPLOYED WILL SAFELY INTERACT WITH OTHER ROAD USERS. INCLUDED IN PUBLIC TRANSIT VEHICLES AND PEOPLE WALKING AND BIKING ON OUR STREETS. DURING THE PERIOD WHERE AUTONOMOUS AND NON AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES SHARE THE STREET. AB IS MUST BE ESPECIALLY SENSITIVE TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD CONTACTS AND SHOULD WORK WITH CITIES TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE AREAS FOR TESTING AND DEPLOYMENT. TODAY ANSWER NAY LINGERS AROUND THREE CRITICAL REGULATORY ISSUES RELATED TO SAFETY THAT OFFER THEIR DISCUSS. THE FIRST IS MAINTAINING CONTROL OF OUR LOCAL STREETS. THE SECOND IS DEVELOPING EFFECTIVE LAW ENFORCEMENT INTERACTION PLANS AND THE THIRD IS ACCESS TO DATA ABOUT HOW ATHEISTS WILL OPERATE ON CITY STREETS. IT'S CRITICAL THE CITY'S MAINTAIN LOCAL CONTROL OF OUR STREETS EVEN A THREE RELY ON THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO SET AB DESIGN OPERATION AND PERFORMANCE STANDARDS. WITH THE CURRENT FEDERAL LEGISLATION DISCUSSED HERE TODAY ON CITIES AND STATES COULD BE PREEMPTED BY FEDERAL RULES AND COULD LOSE THE ABILITY TO ENFORCE THE BASIC RULES OF THE ROAD. THIS COULD CREATE A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH TO A. B. TECHNOLOGY ACROSS THE COUNTRY OF THAT LACK SENSITIVITY TO LOCAL CONTACTS. TO GIVE THE LOCAL EXAMPLE IN SAN FRANCISCO IT IS AGAINST THE LAW TO DRIVE THROUGH A CROSSWALK ONCE PEDESTRIAN HAS ENTERED. RECENTLY A CRUISE VEHICLE OPERATING IN AUTONOMOUS MODE WITH THE TEST DRIVER WAS TICKETED FOR DRIVING THROUGH A CROSSWALK AFTER A PEDESTRIAN HAD ALREADY ENTERED. LUCKILY THE AV DID NOT HIT THE PERSON CROSSING THE STREET. HOWEVER THE FACT REMAINS THAT IN AB WAS NOT PROGRAMMED TO. TO FOLLOW OUR LOCAL TRAFFIC LAWS AND TO ENSURE THAT SAM CISCO REMAINS A SAFE CITY FOR ALL ROAD USERS INCLUDING THOSE LOCKED LAWFULLY WALKING ACROSS THE STREET. WE REALLY NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT INCIDENTS LIKE THIS DO NOT CONTINUE AND THAT IF YOU FOLLOW THE RULES OF THE ROAD. SECOND WE NEED TO ENSURE CLEAR COMMUNICATION BETWEEN AB MANUFACTURES AND FIRST RESPONDERS. IT'S ABSOLUTE ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT AND FIRST RESPONDERS AND KNOW HOW TO INTERACT WITH AB IS IN THE EVENT OF A TRAFFIC INCIDENT OR COLLISION. FOR EXAMPLE ONE AB RECOGNIZE WHEN A POLICE OFFICER IS PULLING IT OVER. HOW WILL THE FIRST RESPOND OR KNOW WHO TO CALL IN THERE'S A COLLISION WHO WILL PICK UP THE PHONE ON THE OTHER AND AND WHERE WILL THEY BE LOCATED? WILL THEY HAVE A REAL TIME CONTROL OVER THE AB. THESE ARE JUST SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT CURRENTLY REMAIN UNANSWERED. WERE ENCOURAGED TO THE DMV REGULATIONS FOR DRIVERLESS AB PERMITS. REQUIRE THE MANUFACTURERS TO SUBMIT THESE PLAN. THE REGULATIONS ARE GOOD START BUT WE BUT WE BELIEVE THAT THEY CAN BE FURTHER STRENGTHENED. IT'S INCREASINGLY CLEAR THE EFFECTIVE AND MEANINGFUL PLANS MUST BE JOINTLY DEVELOPED DEVELOPED BY THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR. IN MARCH SENSES BECAUSE MAYOR MARK FARRELL CONVENED A ROUND TABLE TO SPECIFICALLY DISCUSS AB IS A PUBLIC SAFETY. PARTICIPANTS INCLUDED MANUFACTURERS SUCH AS CREWS WHO WERE LEFT WHEN MOSES UC'S AND PHANTOM AUTO. AND SAN FRANCISCO FIRST RESPONDERS INCLUDING THE POLICE DEPARTMENT FIRE DEPARTMENT SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT NCHC. THIS IS THE OPPORTUNITY TO ENSURE THAT CITIES CONCERNS WERE HEARD BY COMPANIES BEFORE THEY DEPLOYED DEPLOYED AB IS ON THE STREETS. AND ADDITIONALLY HOLD ON EDUCATE THE CITY'S PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICERS ON THE CURRENT STATE OF THE TECHNOLOGY AND DISCUSS THE COMPANY'S APPROACH TO PUBLIC SAFETY TO FURTHER CUT TO INITIATE THIS DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR. AS A RESULT OF THIS WORK WE DEVELOP SEVERAL SPECIFIC POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS THAT CAN IMPROVE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT INTERACTION. INCLUDING IMPROVING THE NOTIFICATION PROCESS BETWEEN MANUFACTURERS AND LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. CLEAR PROTOCOL FOR COMMUNICATION WITH THE REMOTE OPERATOR. OF AN AV WHO'S AVAILABLE AT ALL TIMES. SPLIT THE DIRECTIONS ON INTERACTING WITH A VIEWS IN THE EVENT OF A COLLISION INCLUDING SAFETY HAZARDS AND REAL TIME NOTIFICATION TO CITIES ONE ANYTHING COVERED IN THE LAW ENFORCEMENT INTERACTION PLANNED CHANGES. AND I'M HAPPY TO TO FURTHER DISCUSS ANY THESE RECOMMENDATIONS LATER. IN ADDITION A STRENGTHENING OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT ACTION PLANS WE'VE IDENTIFIED SEVERAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR FUTURE INFORMATION SHARING BETWEEN THE COMPANIES AND THE CITY. US SUCH TOPICS INCLUDE TRAFFIC AND PARKING VIOLATION PROTOCOL STOLEN VEHICLE PROTOCOL UNMARKED CAR INTERACTIONS TRANSIT PROTOCOLS DATA RECORDER AND OTHER POST COLLISION POLICIES. AND THIS IS JUST A PREVIEW OF THE LONG LIST OF TOPICS. UP THE SERVICES GO POLICE DEPARTMENT WILL CONVENE THEIR FIRST WORKING GROUP OF MANUFACTURERS AND FIRST RESPONDERS TO BEGIN TACKLING THESE TOPICS IN THE NEXT COUPLE WEEKS. LASTLY ONE CLOSE BY DISCUSSING THE IMPORTANCE OF DATA TO ENSURE AND ENHANCE PUBLIC SAFETY. CITIES NEED DATA TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS. CURRENTLY THE ONLY PROVISION FOR DATA SHARING IN THE NEW DMV REGULATIONS IS AN ANNUAL REPORT SUMMARIZING DISENGAGEMENT SUBMITTED TO THE DMV. THIS REPORT LIVES IN TIME UNLOCKS KEY INFORMATION CITIES NEED TO BE RESPONSIVE. USEFUL DATA FROM AVIANS INCLUDES ANONYMIZE DETAILS ABOUT VEHICLE MOVEMENT. ROADWAY ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS WHEN CRASHES OCCUR AND EVEY DISENGAGEMENT WERE HUMAN DRIVERS MUST TAKE OVER THAT THOMAS DRIVING SYSTEM. AMONG OTHERS A THIRD PARTY ENTITIES SUCH AS THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR CITY TRANSPORTATION OFFICIALS ARE NOT SO HAVE DEVELOPED DATA SHARING PLATFORMS IN CONSULTATION WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR THAT CAN WORK FOR BOTH AB MANUFACTURES AND PUBLIC DECISION MAKERS. AND WE STRONGLY ENCOURAGE THE STATE TO SUPPORT THESE DATA SHOWING EFFORTS. BUT TO FOCUS ON PUBLIC SAFETY. SO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON THIS THIS AFTERNOON AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY FOR THE QUESTION. THANK YOU FOR THAT ANY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HAVE QUESTIONS OF THE PANEL. ASIA OPPORTUNITY. THIS I HAVE A COUPLE WRITTEN DOWN ON MR WITH THE DMV AND AND WORK OUR WAY. THROUGH. JEAN BERNARD. HOW DOES THE DMV USE THE DISENGAGEMENT REPORTS? SO THAT WE NEED TO DISENGAGE REPORTS TO TO MONITOR HALL THEIR TECHNOLOGY IS PROGRESSING AND ALSO WHEN A COMPANY DOES APPLY FOR A PERMIT WE USE THAT AS AN ADDITIONAL TOOL TO EVALUATE. A HOW THE PROGRESS THE COMPANIES MAKING ON THE TECHNOLOGY SO WE USE IT AS INFORMATION PURPOSES TO FURTHER GET INFORMATION. OUT FROM THE COMPANIES. THANK YOU FOR THAT. SO WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF PROHIBITING MANUFACTURERS FROM CHARGING PASSENGERS ONE THE TESTING PHASE. WELL FOR THAT THAT THAT WAS PRESS TO SEGMENT AT TESTING FROM DEPLOYMENT. IF THE COMPANY IS CHART ALLOWED TO CHARGE A FEE DURING TESTING A COMEY COULD CONTINUE CONTINUOUSLY TASSELS THERE OUT EVERITT THE PLANES WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT COMPANIES. TESTED AND THEN MOVED ON TO DEPLOYMENT. IS TO KANSEN CHU. PITCHER I JUST THOUGHT OH HOW THE QUESTION FOUR. AND JD. AND DR THE SENIOR ANALYST SO YOU'RE. NOT WHEN WE HOW CLOSE ARE AUTONOMOUS VERY COOL ON THE ROAD. BIKE LARGE. QUANTITY DO YOU SEE THAT IT WILL INCREASE OR DECREASE THE LOCAL TRAFFIC. I WOULD IMAGINE THE INTRODUCTION OF ANY NEW VEHICLES ON THE STREETS WOULD INCREASE TRAFFIC. AND CONGESTION. I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY FOR CITIES YOU KNOW AND. IF WE DO HAVE MORE DATA ABOUT. THE MOVEMENT OF THESE VEHICLES ON THE STREET TO. I'M DESIGN ACCORDINGLY BUT I THINK AT THE BEGINNING. WE WOULD EXPECT FULL TRAFFIC WHO MARK AND CHRIS WILSON POINT WE KIND OF. MORAL FIFTH THOMAS SMITH VEHICLE ON THE ROAD. IF NOTHING ELSE CHANGES THEN I'D SAY YES MAHOOD THANK YOU. THANK YOU THE BACK TO RUN THE DMV. SO WHEN DOES THE DMV ANTICIPATE THEY WILL THEY WILL BEGIN ISSUING REGULATIONS FOR TESTING AND DEPLOYMENT VEHICLES OVER TEN THOUSAND POUNDS. SO AT THIS TIME WE HAVE NOT BEEN FIFTH BEGUN WORKING ON THIS WE WOULD RECOGNIZE THAT THE SAFETY AND REGULATORY CONDITIONS ABOUT SORT OF WITH THIS SO. AT THIS TIME WE HAVE NOT BEGUN THAT. LAST QUESTION TO THE DMV IS. IS THE DMV CONCERNED ABOUT THE LACK OF APPLICATIONS TO TEST DRIVE WAS CARS ON PUBLIC ROADS. I KNOW THIS SHOWS THAT THE COMPANIES ARE BEING VERY DELIVER TIP IN. LOOKING AT THAT AT TIMES VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY IN TERMS OF SOME MEAN AN APPLICATION. NO AT THIS TIME WE'RE NOT CONCERNED OKAY THANK YOU. SO PROCEEDS BEING RICH. IS A CSP GIVING ENOUGH INFORMATION FOR THE MANUFACTURERS IN THEIR LAW ENFORCEMENT INTERACTION PLANTS. BUT WE WE HAVE THE FIRST PLAN THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY REVIEWING AND. WHEN THE PROCESS OF THAT IT'S NOT IT'S AN AND IT'S NOT ONLY THE INFORMATION JUST HAVING A DISCUSSION WITH THE ASSISTANT CHIEF IS REVIEWING THE PLAN ITSELF. IT'S MAKING SURE THE INFORMATION IS IN A. USABLE READILY ACCESSIBLE FORMAT THAT'S KINDA HALF THE BATTLE AND AND PULL IT ALL TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE IT'S GONNA BE EASY TO UNDERSTAND FOR THE OFFICER ON THE SIDE THE ROAD. IF WE NEED ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WILL CERTAINLY ASK THE MANUFACTURE FOR THAT INFORMATION BUT RIGHT NOW WHAT I'M BEING TOLD IS THAT WE HAVE THE INFORMATION WE NEED ON THE ON THIS FOR. PERFECT. SO WHAT IF ANYTHING DOES THE CHP DO IF THEY LEARN A COMPANY WILL BE TESTING AN AUTOMATED VEHICLE IN AN AREA WITHIN THEIR JURISDICTION. WELL THE FIRST THING WE WOULD DO IT IS IS MAKE SURE THAT THEY MANUFACTURE HAS PROVIDED THE APPROPRIATE INFORMATION THAT REQUIRED THE REGULATIONS BOTH THE INFORMATION THAT GOES ALL THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT. GOVERNMENTS ABOUT THAT THERE WHO WHERE WEB WHEN WHAT WHY. AND THEN ALSO OF COURSE MAKING SURE ALL THE INFORMATION FOR THE LAW ENFORCEMENT. INTERACTION PLAN IS THERE. AND THEN WE WOULD WITH SOME THAT WE'VE ALREADY DONE ACTUALLY JT MADE REFERENCE TO IT TO SIT DOWN WITH OUR LOCAL ALLIED AGENCY PARTNERS. AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS TO TALK ABOUT OKAY. ARE WE PREPARING FOR THIS IS MAKE SURE WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE LIST TO MAKE SURE WE ALL HAVE THE SAME ENFORCEMENT POSTURE AND CERTAINLY STAY IN TOUCH WITH EACH OTHER AND SHARE EXPERIENCES A BILL DRAWN THOSE EXPERIENCES SO WE. ARE DOING THINGS THE RIGHT WAY AND AND RELYING ON EACH OTHER. SO HERE'S ONE OF THEM MIGHT BE OF INTEREST. HOW WITH THE CHP RESPONDED SAYING AUTOMATED VEHICLE IN THE AREA WHERE THEY HAVE NOT SPECIFIED? BUT THEY'VE. WOULD BE TESTING. THAT YOU KNOW ACTION THERE'S ACTUALLY AT ONE OF THE SECTIONS I REFERENCED. COULD POTENTIALLY ADDRESS THAT VERY THING I MEAN IT'S AN INFRACTION TO BE TESTING AVR PUBLIC ROADWAYS WITHOUT AN APPROVED APPLICATION. IF FOR INSTANCE THERE'S A SITUATION WHERE A APPROVED A LICENSEE OR SOMEONE HAS APPROVED PERMIT AND THEY'RE JUST OPERATING MAYBE A LITTLE BIT OUTSIDE THE GEOGRAPHICAL BOUNDARY WHERE THEY. WERE THAT THEY HAVE IDENTIFIED WE WOULD CERTAINLY REFER THAT INFORMATION TO THE DMV TO TAKE THE APPROPRIATE REGULATORY ACTION AGAINST THAT. MANUFACTURE. SO ONE WAS QUESTION FOR THE CHP. SO YOU TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE OF. I THINK THE LEGISLATURE IS DONDE TO IMPROVE THE. ROLL OUT DOES HE'S PRE NEED ANY ADDITIONAL AUTHORIZATION TO REMOVE. AUTOMATED VEHICLES THAT THERE HAVE NOT BEEN PERMITTED TO TESTING CALIFORNIA. WE'RE IN THE PROCESS RIGHT NOW OF EVALUATING WHERE IN THE VEHICLE CODE. ADJUSTMENTS MAY NEED TO BE MADE TOO TO MAKE IT EXPLICIT THAT BOTH THE ENFORCEMENT ACTION AND AND OTHER. AUTHORIZATIONS APPLY IN THE AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE CONTEXT. FOR RIGHT NOW WE IT IN IN SOME PLACES IS PUTTING A SQUARE PEG IN A ROUND HOLE. BUT WE DO WE THINK WE DO HAVE AN APPROACH TO TAKE TO GET AN UNSAFE AB OFF THE ROAD SIR. THANK YOU MEN WERE GONNA GO WITH YOU. WORKING CALIFORNIA DUE TO BETTER ADVOCATE ITS POSITION ON AUTOMATED VEHICLES IN WASHINGTON DC. I WOULD SAY THAT. AT LEAST YOUR. TWO SENATORS ARE DOING A FANTASTIC JOB OF. ENSURING THAT IF THE SENATE DOES MOVE FORWARD. WITH THE BILL THAT. THE CONCERNS THAT I'VE HEARD. EXPRESSED HERE TODAY ARE TAKING INTO ACCOUNT. WITH A WITH ANY FEDERAL BILL THAT OUT DOES. GET NAKED AND SIGNED INTO LAW BY THE PRESIDENT. SWIMMER BEEN A WHAT IS IT AND A SEAL DOING TO PROTECT STATES RIGHTS ON AUTOMATED. VEHICLE TESTING ALSO SHIRT SO. I I THINK THAT QUESTION BOILS DOWN TO. REALLY. AS STATES HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO CURRENTLY ON. ISSUE. AND AN OPERATOR'S LICENSE TO A HUMAN TO OPERATE A MOTOR VEHICLE HOW DOES THAT AUTHORITY EXTEND TO WHEN THAT. OPERATOR IS A A SOFTWARE ARM AND I THINK WE HAVE BEEN. ADVOCATING AND LOBBYING ON STATES BEHALF TO ENSURE THAT STATES RETAIN THAT AUTHORITY GOING FORWARD. AS AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES ARE INTRODUCED. FOR COMMERCIAL SALE. JD WE HAD OF HIS COUPLE QUESTIONS. A WHAT IF ANY PREPARATIONS DOES SAN FRANCISCO MAKE ONE IS MADE AWARE OF TESTING BEING CONDUCTED ON HIS PUBLIC STREETS. YEAH THIS POINT WE HAVEN'T BEEN DOING ANYTHING THAT. AND PARTICULARLY GIVEN THAT WE WOULD OTHERWISE WE STOLE ON YOU KNOW AS I MENTION BEFORE THE EXAMPLE WHERE CHRIS WAS TICKETED THAT WAS JUST OUR OFFICERS OUT DOING WHAT THEY USUALLY DO MAKING SURE THAT ANY VEHICLE ON THE ROAD IS FOLLOWING. FOLLOWING LOCAL TRAFFIC LAWS. YEAH. SO NO PUBLIC GIVE INFORMATION AND. DRIVERS VEHICLES AND MESSAGING BOARDS ANYTHING THAT I'M WE HAD NOT BY ISSUE THE PUBLIC. WE HAVE NOT YET DISCUSSED UP BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD THAT WE SHOULD. OKAY THANK YOU. MEN ARE YOU GETTING ADEQUATE INFORMATION FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT INTERACTION REPORTS. THAT WE TALKED ABOUT. YEAH YOU KNOW THIS THAT THE MERS ROUNDTABLE IT DISCUSSED. BEFORE WITH OUR FIRST RESPONDERS AND THE MANUFACTURERS I'M A LOT OF THE CONVERSATION HAS NATURALLY BEEN AROUND THESE LAW ENFORCEMENT INTERACTION PLANS. WE THINK THAT THERE'S JUST SO MANY UNANSWERED QUESTIONS THAT WE THINK THAT IT'S A REALLY GOOD FRAMEWORK THAT WE HAVE NOW THAT THERE IS THERE IS MORE THAT WE COULD. REQUIRE A MORE EXPLICITLY LIKE FOR EXAMPLE. WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE YEAH I'D LIKE A MONTHS NOTICE WHEN BEFORE OF THE AND AB IS GOING TO BE TESTING OR DEPLOYING ON THEIR STREETS RATHER THAN GETTING A NOTICE WHEN IT'S ALREADY HAPPENING. A LOT OF THIS IS HAPPENING AT THE STATE LEVEL YOU KNOW LIKE THE CHP WILL BE NOTIFIED. BUT IT'S IT'S UNCLEAR EXACTLY WHO WITH THE LOCAL LEVEL WILL BE NOTIFIED AND ONE. AND SO WE WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SURE THAT. YOU KNOW THE MAYOR'S OFFICE AND OUR POLICE CHIEF KNOW IN ADVANCE WHEN DID VEHICLES WILL BE. TESTING ON OUR STREETS AND THAT SO WE CAN. PREPARE ACCORDINGLY. CYNICISM. I COULD PLAN THE NEEDS TO HAPPEN. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE OF THE PANEL. MR WAS FROM. I APOLOGIZE THAT I JUST WHAT CAME IN SO MAYBE THIS WAS OR EVEN ANSWER BUT CAN IT WHAT OTHER STATES HAVE. WHAT OTHER STATES DOING IN THERE ARE GOOD THINGS AND WHERE THE STATE'S TWO IN THERE? AS A GOOD. IF ANYONE COULD ANSWER THAT. BEEN HOT FOR THE NATIONAL CONFERENCE OF STATE LEGISLATURES. SO ON OUR WEBSITE. YOU WILL SEE THAT WE HAVE STATED THAT TWENTY TWO STATES I HAVE ACTED PIECE OF LEGISLATION TEN GOVERNORS HAVE SIGNED EXECUTIVE ORDERS THAT RELATE TO AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES. BUT I WOULD COUCH THAT WITH. DID THAT COVERS A WIDE RANGE OF POTENTIAL LEGISLATION FROM ANYTHING FROM OFF FUNDING. A CONNECTED VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY PILOT PROGRAM TO SOMETHING AS SPECIFIC AS THE AYE REGULATIONS ISSUED BY THE CALIFORNIA DMV. SO REALLY YOU HAVE I WOULD SAY WHAT IS MAYBE A BIT MORE THAN A HANDFUL OF STATES INCLUDING CALIFORNIA NEVADA COLORADO. FLORIDA MICHIGAN AND OFF TOM I HAD THAT HAVE REALLY. GONE MAYBE TO THE NEXT STEP IN TERMS OF. EITHER PASSING LEGISLATION OR HAVING THEIR DOT YOUR D. AND B. ISSUE OP MORE SPECIFIC RULES OF THE ROAD IF YOU WILL. THERE ARE IN CERTAIN STATES. WHERE WE HAVE? WHERE GOVERNOR HAS ISSUED EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT PROMPTS THE DOT OR THE DMB DEPENDING UPON THE STATE AYE THERE IT'S IT'S A BIT UNCLEAR BECAUSE THERE'S MUCH MORE LEEWAY GIVE INTO THAT EXECUTIVE AGENCY WHEREAS IN? THE STATE'S I MENTIONED EARLIER I YOU HAVE MORE SPECIFIC LEGISLATION THAT PUTS OUT. CIVIC REQUIREMENTS ON THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH OFF FOR HOW ANY RULES OF THE ROAD I SHOULD BE WRITTEN AND WHAT THEY SHOULD TAKE INTO ACCOUNT. JUST SO TWO QUICK FOLLOW UP TO US IN TERMS OF BEST PRACTICE ARE THERE SOME STATES THAT HAVE. ITEM GOOD DONE IT THAT WE SHOULD TAKE INTO ACCOUNT. AND TO THE PRINCIPLES WE SHOULD WE SHOULD THAT FACTOR IN TO OUR DECISIONS. SO I THINK ARE THE BIGGEST QUESTION THAT WAS ANSWERED. VERY RECENTLY BY A CALIFORNIA WAS WHETHER OR NOT TESTING SHOULD TAKE PLACE WITH A. PERSON IN THE DRIVER SEAT OR WITHOUT ALMOND PRIOR TO THAT WAS KIND OF A QUESTION WHERE YOU HAD SOME STATES ARE THAT WERE ALLOWING TESTING TO GO FORWARD WITHOUT AND SOME STATES. THAT WERE NOT ALLOWING IT TO GO FORWARD AND WE'VE SEEN A MOVEMENT TOWARDS MANY STATES INCLUDING NOW CALIFORNIA ARE MOVING TOWARDS ALLOWING TESTING. WITH THE APPROPRIATE AUTHORIZATION FROM THE DEAR TO YOUR DMB TO ALLOW TESTING TO GO FORWARD WITHOUT AN OPERATOR IN THAT SEAT BUT STILL REQUIRING. AYE SOME TYPE OF LINK BETWEEN EITHER A PERSON IN THE VEHICLE OR SOMEONE OUTSIDE OF THE VEHICLE THAT IS ABLE TO BRING THAT VEHICLE I TO A STOP. OR REMOVE IT FROM THE ROADWAY I SHOULD BE AUTOMATED DRIVING SYSTEM ARE NOT BE ABLE TO OPERATE IN THAT THE CONDITION THAT IT'S BUT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU THEN WHAT I'M HEARING TO TODAY'S A POSSIBILITY. JEAN IN AMBER ARE THEN MAYBE WE WORK WITH OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ON ON ON. A ROLL OUT ANNOUNCEMENT OF FOR THE PUBLIC ALSO JUST BECAUSE. I THINK THAT IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT THEY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO KNOW THIS INTO. TECHNOLOGY AND THEY NEED TO BE WARY ALSO JUST JUST BECAUSE WE'RE NOT USED TO IT. AND SO I THINK THAT WE CAN LOOK AT THAT. THAT ALSO RICH I THINK YOU AND I'VE TALKED EARLIER ON ABOUT THE THE. TALKING TO THE MANUFACTURES ABOUT A MASTER SHOT OFF. WHEN I USED TO RACE WE HAD A MASTER SHUT OFF IN THE BACK OF THE CAR. WHO'S JUST TO PUSH OFF IT DISABLED IT COMPLETELY. I THINK THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AND HIMSELF SAFETY OF NOT ONLY THE PUBLIC SAFETY BUT ALSO THE THE PUBLIC IN ITSELF. WITH THAT I WANT TO THANK EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU FOR COMING UP THIS AFTERNOON. REFORMATION WAS MOST HELPFUL THANK YOU. RECALL THE SECOND PANEL UP. WE HAVE JUDGE JEREMY MERTZ VICE PRESIDENT WESTERN REGION AMERICAN INSURANCE ASSOCIATION. ROSEMARY XIN SIOBHAN. PRESIDENT CONSUMERS. FOR AUTO RIB RELIABILITY AND SAFETY. SAYS SHOWN SENIOR STAFF TECHNOLOGISTS ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION AND VERY BROAD WITH THE TEAMSTERS. BUT HEAD THEN START WITH GERMANY AND A WORKER WITH. PLEASE PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS SHARE MEMORIES ABOUT THE AMERICAN INSURANCE ASSOCIATION. AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY AT THIS INFORMATIONAL HEARING ON ATV SAFETY. I'M RARELY ON A PANEL. FOR CONSUMERS. SO IT'S A IT'S A. IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE TODAY AND AND AND I THINK THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY ESPECIALLY WHEN WE TALK ABOUT OUR INDIVIDUAL POLICYHOLDERS AS A. B. TECHNOLOGY. EVOLVES AND THERE'S A A DEPLOYMENT. WE WE HAVE A AN IMPORTANT VOICE. A I A. IT IS THAT WE REPRESENT THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY. TNC PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURERS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY WE READ ABOUT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS. INDIRECT PREMIUM. AND WE ARE AN ACTIVE ADVOCATE. AT BOTH THE STATE AND FEDERAL LEVEL. FOR ATV SAFETY. PARTICULARLY AS IT PERTAINS TO OPERATIONAL SAFETY WE'RE SUPPORTIVE OF THIS TECHNOLOGY. AND WE THINK THAT I MEET NEEDS TO BE TESTED AND PROVEN TO PROVIDE AND ENHANCE SAFETY FOR DRIVERS PASSENGERS AND PEDESTRIANS. WE THINK THAT ON THIS IS THE PARAMOUNT PUBLIC POLICY ISSUE. IN DEVELOPING THIS TECHNOLOGY AND WE HAVE A NUMBER OF SUGGESTIONS TO FURTHER ON THIS GOAL FIRST OF ALL I THINK. ON THE CORNERSTONE OF AIDS E. V. PUBLIC POLICY IS THE NEED FOR AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES TO MEET ALL FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL SAFETY MOTOR VEHICLE REQUIREMENTS. THIS INCLUDES AMONGST MANY OTHER THINGS PASSENGER RESTRAINTS CRASH WORTHINESS DRIVER RELIABILITY. AND FOLLOWING THE RULES OF THE ROAD. ANYTHING LAST IN THE RELIABILITY AND SAFETY OF AB IS WILL BE IN DOUBT AND THE WE BELIEVE AND I THINK IT'S BEEN THE POINT'S BEEN MADE THE PUBLIC ACCEPTANCE. WILL SUFFER. SECONDLY. WE STRONGLY ADVOCATE FOR ROBUST EFFORTS. TO HARDEN ATVS AGAINST CYBER ATTACKS AND HACKING. WITH TELEMATICS DEDICATED SHORT RANGE VEHICLE TO VEHICLE AND VEHICLE TO INFRASTRUCTURE COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS. AND THERE ARE MYRIAD OF AVENUES OF BAD ACTORS TO ATTACK INDIVIDUAL VEHICLES AN ENTIRE SYSTEM. A MASS SYNCRETIZED SYNCHRONIZED. CYBER ATTACK ON ATVS AND COULD HAVE CATASTROPHIC CONSEQUENCES I I DON'T THINK WE'VE SEEN ON IN VEHICLES BEFORE. PUBLIC POLICY IN THIS ARENA MUST SEEK TO VIGOROUSLY GUARD AGAINST THIS. THIRD AND PROBABLY MOST IMPORTANT THE INSURERS. IS KNOWLEDGE AND THE DATA THAT. CAN BE USED TO DERIVE THIS KNOWLEDGE. IN ORDER TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS SAFE TECHNOLOGY AND WHAT IS NOT SAFE TECHNOLOGY IN THIS APPLIES WHETHER IT'S INSURES TRYING TO. CREATE THE MOST ACCURATE RATES FOR PRODUCTS CONSUMERS DECIDING WHICH ATVS TO USER BY. AB DEVELOP DEVELOPERS ATTEMPTING TO IMPROVE PERFORMANCE. OR PUBLIC POLICY DECISION MAKERS LAWMAKERS CREATING VEHICLE SAFETY LAWS I'M FUNDAMENTALLY WE CANNOT MANAGE A BUT WE DO NOT MEASURE IN DATA AND KNOWLEDGE DRIVEN FROM IT ARE THE ELEMENTAL ASPECTS TO IMPROVED AB SAFETY AND AGAIN. PUBLIC ACCEPTANCE I'M FIRST ENSURE SPECIFICALLY. ACCESS TO THE BROADEST RANGE OF OPERATIONAL DATA WILL HELP US DO OUR JOBS AND IDENTIFYING PRICING IN MITIGATING RISK. THIS INCLUDES KNOWING WHEN SYSTEMS DISENGAGE WARN DRIVERS HAVE LAPSES IDENTIFY LAPSES I'M OR FAIL A TO IDENTIFY HAZARDS. INSURERS WILL CERTAINLY GET THIS DATA. AS CLAIMS ARISE BUT IF WE'RE GOOD TO GET OUT FRONT OF THIS WE NEED AND AND BE ABLE OFFER PRODUCTS. THAT A PROPERLY PRICED PRODUCTS WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO GET THIS DATA ON THE FRONT END. IT HELPS US TO BOND CREE CAPITAL FORMATION ON AND TO CREATE AGAIN POLICY PRODUCTS FOR. INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS ESPECIALLY ONCE THERE'S A ROLL OUT. ON THE DEPLOYMENT OF AB TECHNOLOGY AND FINALLY I THINK. THE INSURANCE MARKETPLACE CAN SPEAK UNTO THE SAFETY OF DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES BY AVOIDING CROSS SUBSIDIES THAT HARM BETTER SAFER TECHNOLOGIES. WHILE BENEFITING READER WEAKER AND LESS SAFE TECHNOLOGIES. I THINK IT'S BEEN DISCUSSED ALREADY BUT THE DISENGAGEMENT REPORTS WE THINK ARE. IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF THIS. DATA ACQUISITION AND THESE REPORTS HELP US UNDERSTAND HOW THE RISK OF SYSTEM SHUT DOWNS OR HANDOFFS. AND I THINK IN PARTICULAR ON THE USABILITY OF THESE REPORTS ON THAT THEY PROVIDE INFORMATION ON THERE REALLY INSTRUCTS NOT ONLY THAT IT JUST ENGAGED BUT WHY DISENGAGED. AND ALLOWS UNINSURED UNDERSTAND WHICH TECHNOLOGIES ON WORK BETTER AND ARE SAFER. AND THEN FINALLY I KNOW THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION AROUND THIS. AT BOTH THE DMB REGULATORY PROCESS. AND ON CAUGHT OTHER STAKEHOLDER CONVERSATIONS IN HEARINGS BUT WE DO BELIEVE. THAT. LEVEL THREE. I AM. IT. LEVEL THREE DRIVING A SYSTEMS NEED TO HAVE A DRIVER IN THE VEHICLE. WE THIS IS A. CONDITIONAL AUTOMATION THAT IS DESIGNED WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT THE HUMAN DRIVER A MAY HAVE TO INTERVENE. JEWISH SINCE WE THINK AS INSURERS. WITH THAT WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH A NUMBER OF STAKEHOLDERS IS THIS DISCUSSION CONTINUES. WORKING WITH THIS COMMITTEE THE DMV. AND I AM AVAILABLE FOR ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU ROSEMARY. KEVIN FRASER AND. CONVENE BETTER SAKE YOU SO MUCH FOR THE INVITATION TO TESTIFYING THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT THE CHAIR AND OTHER MEMBERS HAVE BEEN DOING. TO IMPROVE SAFETY AND CALIFORNIA THROUGH VARIOUS. PROVEN. MEANS SUCH AS GRADUATED LICENSING AND ADDRESSING DISTRACTED DRIVING AND IMPAIRED DRIVING THAT HAS HAVE REALLY OF A POSITIVE IMPACT IN OUR STATE. AND. WE'RE PLEASED TO BE HERE TESTIFYING WITH OUR FRIENDS IN THE TEAMSTERS AND WE SHARE THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT. THE IMPACT THE NEGATIVE IMPACT ON. JOBS AND DRIVERS WHO RELY ON TO DO THE DRIVING UNDER DEVELOPED A LOT OF EXPERTISE AND WE HAVE A REGULATORY REGIME IN PLACE. SO THAT THEY ARE SUBJECT TO A LOT OF REGULATION AND HAVE TO GET SPECIAL LICENSES AND SO ON DEPENDING ON WHAT THEIR DRIVING. AND WE'VE WORK IN COALITIONS WITH. ENTITIES IN NEW IN. WASHINGTON DC. INTERPOSING EFFORTS THAT ARE ONGOING THAT WOULD ALLOW TEENAGERS TO TRY. TRUCKS. HONOR FOR HIGHWAYS BIG RIGS. CARS WORKS ON THE STATE AND FEDERAL LEVEL ON A WHOLE HOST OF AUTO SAFETY ISSUES. AND WERE PART OF A COALITION OF SAFETY MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS AND BICYCLE LUIS ORGANIZATIONS AND ORGANIZATIONS OF. ARE. ACTIVE IN THE PUBLIC HEALTH SPHERE THEIR OPPOSING THE AV START ACT THAT IS IN DC WERE VERY GRATEFUL FOR SENATOR FEINSTEIN AND SENATOR HARRIS IS ROLE. IN TAPPING THE BRAKES ON THAT LEGISLATION IT'S FUNDAMENTALLY FLAWED FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS ONE OF THEM BEING THAT WOULD PREEMPT STATE LAW. AND IT WOULD CREATE A REGULATORY VACUUM WHERE THERE ARE NO NEW FEDERAL MOTOR VEHICLE SAFETY STANDARDS IN PLACE THERE IS SPECIFIC TO THE NEW TECHNOLOGY. WHILE OPENING THE FLOODGATES FOR THE VEHICLES NOT ONLY TO BE. DEVELOPED AND TESTED BUT ACTUALLY TO BE SOLD CONSUMERS. AND I THINK THAT BOOK THE. CRASHES THAT ARE OCCURRING RIGHT NOW OR UNFORTUNATELY VERY TRAGIC EVIDENCE THAT WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL. ARM AND NOT. LEAPT INTO THIS SPACE PREMATURELY. AND I WOULD QUOTE FROM OF TESTIMONY BY THE PRESIDENT OF ADVOCATES FOR HIGHWAY AND AUTO SAFETY WHOSE BOARD OF DIRECTORS INCLUDES LEAVING HEALTH AND SAFETY ADVOCATES AND REPRESENTATIVES. OF THE NATION'S LEADING AUTO INSURANCE COMPANIES. THAT THE PROCESS CREATED IN THE AB START ACT WOULD ALLOW UNTESTED AND UNPROVEN. AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES TO BE SOLD TO THE PUBLIC WITHOUT APPROPRIATE INDEPENDENT OR GOVERNMENTAL INSIGHT TO PROVIDE NECESSARY PROTECTIONS. BOTH TO THOSE IN THE A VIEWS AND THOSE SHARING THE ROADS WITH THEM. THE AV START ACT TAKES A WRONG TURN BY ALLOWING FOR THE SALE OF POTENTIALLY MILLIONS OF ECONOMISTS VEHICLES TO THE PUBLIC. WITHOUT MINIMUM SAFETY STANDARDS WITHOUT NECESSARY CONSUMER INFORMATION SO THAT THE PUBLIC UNDERSTANDS OUR CAPABILITIES AND LIMITATIONS. AND WITHOUT CYBERSECURITY STANDARDS TO PROTECT AGAINST HACKERS. ACCORDING TO PATRICK LYNN WHO IS DIRECTOR OF THE ETHICS IN EMERGING SCIENCE IS GROUP A CALIFORNIA POLYTECHNIC UNIVERSITY SELF DRIVING CARS MAY ENABLE NEW CRIMES WE CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE. TODAY SO WE FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT IT'S PREMATURE TO ALLOW THE VEHICLES TO BE SOLD TO THE PUBLIC BEFORE THESE PROTECTIONS ARE IN PLACE. THEY REALLY SHOULD HAPPEN AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. THE NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION SHOULD PROMULGATE THE RULES SO THAT THESE VEHICLES ARE RESISTANT TO HACKING. AND WE ALSO ADVOCATE THAT THE VEHICLES SHOULD HAVE TO PASS A DRIVER'S TEST. IF YOU ARE I ARE GETTING A DRIVER'S LICENSE WE NEED TO DEMONSTRATE THAT WE CAN OPERATE SAFELY ON THE ROAD VARIOUS CONDITIONS. THESE VEHICLES SHOULD HAVE TO DO THE SAME. RIGHT NOW A LOT OF THE VEHICLES THAT ARE OUT THERE CAN'T REALLY SEE TO GO SAFELY IN CONDITIONS SUCH AS YOU KNOW OR FOG OR HEAVY RAINS OR DENSE SMOKE. WORK IF THEY GO OVER A STEEP HILL WHAT THEY SEE IS SCOTT. SO. THEIR REAL LIMITATIONS TO WHERE THEY CAN BE DRIVEN SAFELY. AND THE PUBLIC IS VERY CONFUSED IN FACT THEIR NEWS REPORTS AND SAY THAT ELAINE CHAO WHO IS A SECRETARY TRANSPORTATION IS SAID SHE HERSELF IS VERY CONFUSED. BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT TERMINOLOGY THERE ARE SEMI AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES THAT ARE BEING SOLD TO THE PUBLIC WHERE THEIR. UNCERTAIN WHAT THEY CAN EXPECT THE VEHICLE TO DO TO KEEP THEM SAFE AND WHAT ROLE THEY NEED TO APPLY. THERE'S A LOT OF DATA AVAILABLE THAT SHOWS THAT WHEN PEOPLE. M. GOOGLE COULD I BELIEVE CAN CONFIRM THIS GOOGLE IN WAY MO THAT WHEN PEOPLE ARE IN SEMI AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES THEY TEND TO BE LULLED INTO A FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY. AND THROWN ZONE OUT. AND WE'RE QUESTIONING THE WISDOM OF ALLOWING THOSE VEHICLES TO BE SOLD TO THE PUBLIC. BECAUSE OF THE. THEY THE FACT THAT. THE VEHICLES. CAN'T BE RELIED ON TO OPERATE SAFELY. AT ALL TIMES AND IT'S CONFUSING FOR PEOPLE THEY KNOW WHEN THEY NEED TO TAKE THE WHEEL. AND IT'S ALSO UNREALISTIC TO EXPECT SOMEONE WHO HASN'T BEEN PAYING ATTENTION. TO BE ABLE TO PAY ATTENTION AND SAFELY NAVIGATE IN AN EMERGENCY SITUATION FOR INSTANCE IF THE VEHICLE THIS ENGAGES WHEN IT APPROACH IS A CONSTRUCTION ZONE. AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE DISENGAGEMENT REPORTS AND WE APPLAUD THE DMV FOR REQUIRING THOSE AND ALSO REQUIRING INFORMATION ABOUT WHEN THE VEHICLES DISENGAGED. A LOT OF TIMES WHEN THEY DISENGAGE IT IS. IN CONSTRUCTION ZONES. WHEN. YOU KNOW OUR OUR STATE WORKERS OR OTHER WORKERS MAY BE. IN HARM'S WAY. AND I WOULD. JUST VERY BRIEFLY LIKE TO MENTION THAT. A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE HEARD. FROM TESLA THAT. PUTTING AUTOPILOT IN THEIR VEHICLES REDUCE CRASHES WHERE THEY ARE AIRBAGS DEPLOYED BY FORTY. SENT AND THAT HAS BEEN QUESTION FOR A LONG TIME NOW THERE'S NEW REASON TO BE SKEPTICAL ABOUT THAT FIGURE AS ENCOURAGING IS IT IS. WHEN ADVOCATES FOR HIGHWAY AND AUTO SAFETY EXAMINED THE FIGURE WHAT THEY REPORTED IN THEIR LETTER TO THE CHAIR OF THE NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD WHICH IS A SISTER AGENCY WITH THE NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION. UNDER THE US DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION. THEY REPORTED THAT THE NHTSA REPORT MAKES A STATEMENT THEY CRASH RATES FOR TESLA VEHICLES DROPPED AFTER THE INSTALLATION OF AUTO PILOT. THIS IS AN UNPROVEN AND UNSUPPORTED CONCLUSION BECAUSE IN THE SAME SECTION OF THE REPORT THE AGENCY ADMITS THAT THE SAFETY IMPROVEMENT. IS NOT RELATED TO ACTUAL AUTOPILOT USE. THE FACT IS THAT THIS COMPARISON IN NO WAY PROVES THAT AUTOPILOT REDUCES CRASHES. DOCTOR NEEDY KALRA WHOSE CO DIRECTOR SENIOR INFORMATION SCIENTISTS OF THE RAND CENTER FOR A JUST DECISION MAKING UNCERTAINTY. ALSO NOTICED THIS MISLEADING ANALYSIS IN HER TESTIMONY OFFERED LAST FEBRUARY. OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN BEFORE THE HOUSE ENERGY AND COMMERCE COMMITTEE THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON DIGITAL COMMERCE AND CONSUMER PROTECTION. DOCTOR KALRA STATED THAT THE NHTSA FOUND THE TESLA VEHICLES EQUIPPED WITH AUTO PILOT WERE INVOLVED IN FORTY PERCENT FEER CRASHES IN WHICH AIRBAGS DEPLOYED. THAN PRE AUTOPILOT TESLA VEHICLES HOWEVER THE INTEREST BEST OCCASION REPORTS NEITHER IS A STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS DIFFERENCE NORTHERN NUMBER OF MILES DRIVE DRIVEN BY EACH GROUP OF VEHICLES. FROM WHICH STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE CAN BE COMPUTED. IF THEREFORE NOT POSSIBLE THE DETERMINING CONCLUDE FROM THIS EVIDENCE WHETHER TESLA VEHICLES WITH AUTO PILOT. ARE INDEED SAVORED THEN GOES WITHOUT. AND RECENTLY MAY FOURTH OF THIS YEAR NHTSA. INFORMANT REUTERS AND OTHER PUBLICATIONS THAT RECOVERING AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES. THAT NEW IT'S A SAFETY DEFECT INVESTIGATION ON MODEL YEAR TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN TO TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN TESLA MODEL S. AND MODEL X.. DID NOT ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS OF THE TECHNOLOGY. MR PERFORM THIS CURSORY COMPARISON OF THE RATES BEFORE AND AFTER INSTALLATION OF THE VEHICLE THE DETERMINE WHETHER MODELS EQUIPPED WITH ARTISTS DEAR WERE ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER CRASH RATES. WHICH WOULD HAVE INDICATED THAT FURTHER INVESTIGATION WAS NECESSARY. AND ACTUALLY IF YOU LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF THIS TESLA HAD INCLUDED. AUTOMATIC EMERGENCY BRAKING WITH VEHICLES THAT ALSO HAD THE. AUTOPILOT SO. THERE ARE THOSE AND WHO ARE MORE EXPERT THAN I WHO THINK THAT THAT MAY HAVE BEEN A ONE OF THE LEADING FACTORS. IN. THEIR ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF AUTO PILOT. AND WITH THAT I WOULD CONCLUDE AND I WOULD WELCOME YOUR QUESTIONS THANK YOU SEVERAL MILLION MOVE OVER TO YOU KNOW. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN FRAZIER AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY. I'M SET SHOWN FROM THE ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION. WE'RE A NOT FOR PROFIT TECHNOLOGY POLICY ORGANIZATION BASED IN SAN FRANCISCO. ABOUT NINETY STAFF MEMBERS INCLUDING ATTORNEYS AND TECHNOLOGY RESEARCHERS AND OTHERS. AND TENS OF THOUSANDS OF MEMBERS AROUND THE WORLD. WE WORK ON CIVIL LIBERTIES AND PRIVACY AND THE TECHNOLOGY ENVIRONMENT AND TRY TO SAFEGUARD TECHNOLOGY USERS RIGHTS. I AM A TECHNOLOGIST AND I TRY TO HELP MY LEGAL COLLEAGUES UNDERSTAND DETAILS OF TECHNOLOGY. I'VE BEEN ASKED TO TALK ABOUT. INFORMATION SECURITY CYBERSECURITY ON AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES SO I HAVE A FEW THOUGHTS TO OFFER. FIRST MODERN CARS ARE ALREADY EXTREMELY HIGHLY COMPUTERIZED. EVEN THOSE CARS THAT DON'T INCORPORATE ANY KIND OF AUTONOMOUS OR SELF DRIVING CAPABILITY. THE TREND HAS BEEN TOWARD DRIVE BY WIRE SYSTEMS. LIKE FLY BY WIRE IN AIRPLANES WE'RE TURNING THE WHEEL OR STEPPING ON THE GAS OR BRICK PEDALS. MAY NO LONGER PHYSICALLY ACTIVATE THE CARS MECHANICAL CYST. THE COMPUTER IS TOLD THAT THE DRIVER PERFORMED A PARTICULAR ACTION. AND THE COMPUTER DECIDES AGAIN IN SELF DRIVING OR NON SELF DRIVING VEHICLES. WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES OF THAT ACTION SHOULD? THIS MEANS THAT IN SOME CARS COMPUTER SOFTWARE FOR EXAMPLE DECIDES ON THE CONNECTION OR LACK OF CONNECTION. BETWEEN STEPPING ON THE BRAKE PEDAL AND MECHANICALLY ENGAGING THE BREAK. THAT MAKES THE RELIABILITY OF THAT SOFTWARE ESSENTIAL TO THE CARS SAFE OPERATION. BECAUSE MALICIOUS OR DEFECTIVE SOFTWARE. DEPLOYED TO A CAR COULD MAKE IT MALFUNCTIONING TRAFFIC DISABLE SENSORS. OR EVEN INVERT SAFETY LOGIC SO THAT AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE ATTEMPTS TO CLOSE CRASHES INSTEAD OF AVOIDING THEM. THE MOST DISTURBING SCENARIO THAT I'VE ENCOUNTERED IN RELATION TO DELIBERATE ATTACKS ON AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES. HAS TO DO WITH SKILL. HA AND I THINK MISTER MERCS ALLUDED TO THIS EARLIER AN ATTACKER WHO WANTS TO CAUSE MAYHEM AND FEAR TO TRY TO CAUSE A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF VEHICLES TO MALFUNCTION IN THE SAME WAY AT THE SAME TIME. SUCH AS INTENTIONALLY CRASHING INTO PEDESTRIANS. OF COURSE THERE'S NO REASON TO ASSUME. LET THIS KIND OF ATTACK IS STRAIGHTFORWARD OR EASY TO PULL OFF. IT WOULD REQUIRE SUBVERTING THE WIDE RANGE OF SECURITY CONTROLS WITHOUT BEING DETECTED. BUT IF IT COULD BE DONE FOR VARIOUS REASONS THE CONSEQUENCES COULD BE. MORE WIDESPREAD AND MORE FRIGHTENING. THEN OTHER KINDS OF TECHNOLOGICAL SABOTAGE DIRECTED AND ON A TON OF THE. THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL DEMONSTRATIONS ALREADY THAT SOFTWARE BASED ATTACKS AGAINST CAR SAFETY COULD BE PRACTICAL. THE MOST FAMOUS IS PROBABLY A TWENTY FIFTEEN DEMONSTRATION. BY TWO RESEARCHERS WHO SHOWED THAT THEY COULD REMOTELY TAKEOVER SOME OF THE COMPUTER SYSTEMS IN A JEEP CHEROKEE. WHILE THE VEHICLE WAS BEING DRIVEN IN A WAY THAT COULD HAVE CAUSED THE CRASH. IT'S WORTH REITERATING THAT THE VEHICLE IN THAT CASE WAS NOT USING ANY SORT OF DRIVERLESS OR AUTONOMOUS TECHNOLOGY. A HUMAN WAS BEHIND THE WHEEL OPERATING THE VEHICLE. EVEN SO IT GOES TO SHOW THE COMPUTERS ARE ALREADY SO INTEGRAL TO THE CAR'S OPERATION. DOT THE PRESENCE OF RELIABLE SOFTWARE COULD LEAD DIRECTLY TO A SAFETY HAZARD. AS A RESULT JUST AS WITH OTHER KINDS OF COMPUTING DEVICES BUT MAYBE WITH HIGHER STAKES. SOFTWARE UPDATES AND FIXES NEED TO BE PERFORMED REGULARLY AND THE INTEGRITY OF THE SOFTWARE UPDATES NEEDS TO BE PROTECTED. UNFORTUNATELY THE PROSPECT OF MAKING THE SOFTWARE IN THE VEHICLES NON UPDATABLE. IN ORDER TO AVOID MALICIOUS UPDATES. WOULD BE IN EVEN WORSE SOLUTION BECAUSE IT WOULD MEAN THAT EFFECTS COULD BE FIXED. WHEN THEY'RE DISCOVERED. ARE AGAIN THIS RISK IS NOT ENTIRELY SPECIFIC TO SELF DRIVING CARS INCREASINGLY MANY OF THE SAME KINDS OF RISKS ALREADY EXISTING CURRENT MODELS. WHERE SAFETY FUNCTIONS ARE MANAGED BY SOFTWARE THAT NEEDS TO BE UPDATED OVER TIME AND IS BEING UPDATED OVER TIME? MANY OF HIS INCREASES IN RISKS OUR ESSENTIALLY INCREMENTAL INCREASES IN RISKS THAT MAY ALREADY EXIST. SELF DRIVING VEHICLES MAY CONTAIN ADDITIONAL SENSORS AND ADDITIONAL LOGICAL FUNCTIONALITY. LEADING TO ADDITIONAL COMPLEXITY WHICH DOES PROVIDE MORE OPPORTUNITIES ARE AVENUES FOR EXPORTABLE VULNERABILITIES RELATIVE TO HIGHLY COMPUTERIZED VEHICLES THAT ARE LESS AUTONOMOUS. ALSO AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES MAYBE MORE RELIANT ON ACCURATE MAP DATA. AND OTHER KINDS OF LIVE DATA SERVICES PROVIDED BY MANUFACTURERS AND THEIR SUPPLIERS. AND THAT COULD BE ANOTHER SOURCE OF DISRUPTION. IF THESE SERVICES ARE INTERFERED WITH OR DISABLED IN SOME WAY. WE CAN ENVISION SOME KINDS OF RISKS THAT ARE MORE SPECIFIC TO SELF DRIVING CARS. SUCH AS SO CALLED ADVERSARIAL EXAMPLES IN COMPUTER VISION. WHICH ARE IMAGES THAT ARE SPECIFICALLY CRAFTED TO BE SYSTEMATICALLY MISINTERPRETED. BY PARTICULAR KIND OF COMPUTER VISION SYSTEM. IN GENERAL WE MIGHT THINK OF COMPUTER SOFTWARE AS MORE COLORFUL AND READILY MANIPULATED. THAN HUMAN BEINGS. BUT OF COURSE PEOPLE ARE ALSO EXTREMELY IN PERFECT AND PRONE TO BIAS ERROR IN THIS BEHAVIOR. AND VULNERABLE TO THINGS LIKE OPTICAL ILLUSIONS. AND JUST BECOMING DISORIENTED. IT SEEMS FAIR TO SAY THAT HUMANS AND MACHINES CAN BE MANIPULATED OR LEAD TO MISBEHAVE IN DIFFERENT WAYS FROM ONE ANOTHER. AS MANY OBSERVERS HAVE NOTED COMPUTERS DON'T HAVE TO BE AFFECTED BY FATIGUE OR EMOTION. OR INTOXICANTS THEY DON'T DRIVE DRUNK THEY DON'T GET ANGRY THEY DON'T FALL ASLEEP. THEY USUALLY CAN'T BE DISTRACTED. AND THEIR SENSORS MAY BE ABLE TO FUNCTION IN CONDITIONS WHERE HUMAN SENSES WOULD BE STARTED. AND VICE VERSA. ON THE BRIGHT SIDE MANUFACTURES EXPERTS AND OTHER RESEARCHERS NOT AFFILIATED WITH THE MANUFACTURERS ARE ALSO PRODUCTIVELY EXPLORING THE TOPIC OF AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES CYBERSECURITY. FOR EXAMPLE ACADEMIC RESEARCHERS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON AND THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN. HAVE FOUND IMPORTANT PROBLEMS AND RISKS AS HAVE INDEPENDENT GROUPS. THIS RESEARCH HELPS US TO UNDERSTAND MORE ABOUT WHAT'S POSSIBLE AND WHAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED. BUT SECURITY RESEARCHERS WHO COME TO OUR ORGANIZATION FOR LEGAL ADVICE. OFTEN WORRY THAT THEIR WORK MAY EXPOSE THEM TO LIABILITY OR LITIGATION. FOR INSTANCE FROM MANUFACTURERS WHO MIGHT FEAR EMBARRASSMENT WHEN PROBLEMS ARE REVEALED. SO PROTECTING RESEARCHERS AND MAKING SURE THAT THEY CAN DO THEIR JOB IS OF TREMENDOUS THERE MANY GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY ENTITIES WORKING IN THE FIELD OF VEHICULAR CYBERSECURITY. INCLUDING NHTSA AND IT IS AN INDUSTRY GROUP CALLED THE AUTO ISAC. NEXT THE SAE AND OTHERS. IT'S REALLY WORTH EMPHASIZING THAT THE EXISTENCE OF GUIDANCE AND STANDARDS IN THIS AREA IS NOT A SILVER BULLET. BECAUSE A SINGLE SOFTWARE BUGS CAN BE ENOUGH TO CREATE A MAJOR SAFETY AND SECURITY RISK. MANY OF THE STANDARDS RELATED TO VEHICULAR SECURITY ARE ADDRESSING ISSUES THAT A RELATIVELY HIGH LEVEL. AND NOT A LOW LEVEL OF TECHNICAL DETAILS WERE SOME OF THE BUGS MAY EXIST ON THE VULNERABILITIES MAKE THIS. INFORMATION SECURITY HAS BEEN AN ENORMOUS CHALLENGE ELSEWHERE IN IT. THERE HAS BEEN LOTS OF HACKS LOTS OF OLDER GOODIES AND OTHER KINDS OF COMPUTING SYSTEMS. THAT WE HAVEN'T DEALT WITH VERY WELL THAT THE COMPUTING INDUSTRIES HAVE NOT DEALT WITH VERY WELL. AND OVERALL THIS IS A RELATIVELY NEW PREOCCUPATION FOR THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY. SO THE INDIVIDUAL MANUFACTURERS BEYOND SIMPLY FOLLOWING A CHECKLIST OR FORMULA. ARE GOING TO NEED TO GET A LOT OF SPECIFIC IN HOUSE TECHNICAL EXPERTISE. IN INFORMATION SECURITY. MODERN CARS ALSO HAVE EVER GREATER PRIVACY RISKS BECAUSE OF THE INFORMATION THEY COLLECT AND COMMUNICATE. ABOUT THEIR OCCUPANTS WHEREABOUTS AND ENVIRONMENTS. WELL IF THE AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE DESIGNS THAT WE'VE HEARD ABOUT. INTENDED ENORMOUS NUMBER OF SENSORS THAT CAN DETECT MORE ABOUT THESE THINGS AND ALL OF THEM TEND TO PHONE HOME TO THEIR MANUFACTURES FOR A RANGE OF REASONS. INCLUDING HELPING THE MANUFACTURE TO DEBUG THE SOFTWARE. AND TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW IT PERFORMS IN PARTICULAR REAL WORLD SITUATIONS. IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE THAT MANUFACTURERS WOULD WANT THAT INFORMATION FOR ALL OF THESE REASONS. BUT IT MEANS THAT THE MANUFACTURERS WILL COME INTO POSSESSION OF A LOT OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION ABOUT PEOPLE. WHERE PEOPLE GO WHOM THEY WERE WITH WHAT HE DID? AND WE HAVE A LOT OF CONCERNS ABOUT THEIR HANDLING AND RETENTION OF THAT DATA. THERE ALSO RISKS TO PRIVACY POSSIBLE WHEN VEHICLES ANNOUNCER BROADCAST THEIR OWN LOCATIONS. IF YOU EVER SEEN SERVICES LIKE FLIGHTAWARE FOR TRACKING AIRPLANES. THEY'RE USING THE AIRPLANE EQUIVALENT CALLED THE DSP. TO LITERALLY TRACK INDIVIDUAL AIRPLANES ALL OVER THE COUNTRY FROM MOMENT TO MOMENT. WE WOULDN'T BE THRILLED TO SEE A CAR VERSION. OF THE FLIGHT AWARE SERVICE TO LET YOU LOOK UP THE WHEREABOUTS OF SOMEONE'S PARTICULAR CAR. YEP TECHNOLOGIES LIKE THAT COULD BE A PRIVACY INFRINGING CONSEQUENCE OF SOME DESIGNS FOR LIKE WIRELESS LOCATION BROADCAST. FOR THAT REASON WE COMMENTED LAST YEAR ON THE NHTSA VEHICLE TO VEHICLE OR FEET OF THE PROPOSAL. A PROPOSED REGULATORY MANDATE FOR VEHICLE TO VEHICLE COMMUNICATIONS. pFUTURE SAFETY APPLICATIONS FOR AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES. WE ARGUED THAT THE PROPOSAL WAS AN OBSOLETE AND PRIVACY INVASIVE TECHNOLOGY. THAT COULD POTENTIALLY ALLOW ANYONE TO MONITOR A VEHICLE BY RECEIVING ITS RADIO SIGNALS. BECAUSE INDIVIDUAL CARS WOULD EFFECTIVELY BROADCAST THERE ON THE PETITIONS. THE COMPARATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF IDENTITIES PER CAR. THIS REGULATION HASN'T BEEN ADOPTED SO FAR BUT SEVERAL AUTOMAKERS ARE VOLUNTARILY IMPLEMENTING TELEMETRY AND VEHICLE TO VEHICLE COMMUNICATIONS. AND WE REALLY NEED TO THINK ABOUT THE PRIVACY IMPLICATIONS OF THOSE DATA FLOWS. FOR SAFETY REASONS WE ALSO NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW CAR NEWS THAT A CLAIM TO POSITION REPORT IS REALLY FROM ANOTHER CAR. AND NOT FROM SOMEONE PRETENDING TO BE A CAR AND SAYING HEY I'M IN YOUR WAY. IF MEMBERS ARE SAFER INTERESTED IN THIS TOPIC THERE'S A HUGE AMOUNT OF READING YOU CAN DO AND. PEOPLE WITH INTEREST THOUGHTS IN THIS AREA. INCLUDING SOME OF THE FEDERAL REGULATORS THE GAO RESEARCHERS OF WHO PUT OUT A REPORT TWO YEARS AGO ON VEHICULAR CYBERSECURITY. AND THE SECURITY ENGINEERS AT THE INDIVIDUAL AUTOMAKERS AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE IN THE FUTURE. GETTING SOME ENGINEERS IN HERE AS WELL AS. LAWYERS AND LOBBYISTS BECAUSE THE ENGINEERS WILL HAVE A LOT OF INTERESTING HANDS ON EXPERIENCE. A BOARD MEMBER OF OUR OWN ORGANIZATION BRAD TEMPLETON HAS DONE A LOT OF CONSULTING IN THIS AREA AND HAS A VERY INTERESTING AND THOROUGH WEBSITE. ON THE TOPIC AND OF COURSE SECURITY RESEARCHERS OUTSIDE OF INDUSTRY LIKE ACADEMIC RESEARCHERS IN THE UNIVERSITIES HAVE A LOT OF HANDS ON EXPERIENCE ON THE SECURITY TOPIC. IF WE CAN BE OF ANY HELP IN FINDING SPECIALISTS IN THIS AREA YOU'D BE. THRILLED TO AND. THANKS AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE I'LL ALSO BE HAPPY TO ADDRESS ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IT'S ABOUT A REAL PAPER. I THOUGHT MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS SET THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE HIGH I KNOW ORGANIZED LABOR DISCUSSION LIKE THIS IS SORT OF LIKE HAVING YOUR CRAZY HAND IN THE ROOM OR SOMETHING. BECAUSE THE THOUGHT IS THAT ALL WE CARE ABOUT IS OUR JOBS COM AT ANTIQUATED CONCEPT TOO MANY OF THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM FRANKLY. THEY DON'T CARE WHAT WE DO. BUT WE ALSO KNOW SOMETHING ELSE. OUR MEMBERS DRIVE THESE VEHICLES EVERYDAY DAY IN AND DAY OUT THEY KNOW MORE ABOUT THE PERFORMANCE OF MOTOR VEHICLES THAN ANYBODY THERE S.. THEY KNOW THINGS THAT THE MANUFACTURERS DATE DON'T KNOW THEY KNOW A LOT. AND THEY KNOW A LOT ABOUT SAFETY IN THEIR VERY CONCERNED WITH MAJOR ISSUES. WITH THE TESTING AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES WERE NOT HOSTILE TO CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY THEY HAPPEN ALL THE TIME THAT WOULDN'T BE A TEAMSTERS UNION IF HORSES DIDN'T BECOME TRY. SO THAT'S NOT THE ISSUE BUT THERE IS AN ISSUE ABOUT SAFETY. AND THERE IS A SENSE THAT WE HAVE. THAT THE PACE OF CHANGE IS SO BASS. THAT POLICYMAKERS ARE JUST NOT. ABLE TO RESPOND. BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. AND SO. THEY'RE NOT IN LEGISLATURE'S AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. ARE SORT OF. ABANDONING THE FIELD IN A CERTAIN WAY AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY. LET'S TALK ABOUT FIRST EMPLOYEE AND SAFETY TESTING STANDARDS. WHAT IS OUR SUCCESSFUL TEST OF AN AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES? WHAT IS THE STANDARD WHEN DO THEY MEET THE STANDARD? I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY WHO'S TALKING ABOUT WHAT THEY DO THEY GET TO KILL SOMEONE IS IT SUCCESSFUL. SOMEONE DIES EVERY MILLION MILES TWO MILLION MILES. EVER ARE THEY ALLOWED EVER TO DO THAT I WOULD POSIT. THERE WERE GONNA GO TO FULLY AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES THEY SHOULD NEVER KILL PEOPLE. ON. WHAT ARE THEIR STANDARDS THAT WERE ACTUALLY DOING THE TESTING ANOTHER WORDS ARE WE TESTING THESE VEHICLES UNDER THE REAL CONDITIONS OF OWNERSHIP? THAT IS TO SAY ARE WE GONNA LET THE CAR THE TIRES GO BALD ARE PEOPLE GONNA FORGET TO MAINTAIN THEM. OR A WHAT IS THE REALITY OF THE TESTING OR IS A MANUFACTURER BASICALLY FREE TO TEST THE PRISTINE VEHICLE IN PRISTINE. CONDITIONS IN WHICH. THE OIL IS CHANGED AS OFTEN EXPOSED TO BE CHANGED BUT NOT AS OFTEN AS IT MIGHT BE CHANGED IN THE REAL WORLD. ARE WE WERE REALLY PUSHING THESE VEHICLES ANOTHER WORDS WHEN THEY'RE TESTING RIGHT NOW FOR EXAMPLE WHEN THEY'RE DRIVING THESE VEHICLES AROUND SAN FRANCISCO IS SOMEBODY PAID TO TRY TO HACK INTO ON EVERY SINGLE DAY AND SEE IF THEY CAN. BREAK THEIR CYBERSECURITY. WHAT WHAT WHAT? OBJECTS ARE YOU THROWING IN FRONT OF THEM TO MAKE SURE THEY DON'T RUN OVER THEM ANOTHER WORDS. SAFETY IS USUALLY A MARGIN OF SAFETY BEYOND OF THEIR NORMAL WE DON'T HAVE ANY MEASUREMENT FOR ANY OF THAT AND YOU KURT THE DMV PROPERLY SAY. WHAT WORLD WILL JUST? YOU KNOW APPROVE THESE THINGS FOR TESTING IN CALIFORNIA OR DEPLOYMENT IN CALIFORNIA WHEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DECIDES. BOMB IT'S OKAY EXCEPT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS IN FIGURING THIS OUT AT ALL. NOW. HE THE LEGISLATURE MEAN FOR EXAMPLE YOU GUYS SAID OR DUBBED. DMV SAID WELL WE'RE NOT READY TO TEST COMMERCIAL VEHICLES THE LEGISLATURE IS ALREADY PASSED TWO BILLS. TO ALLOW THE TESTING OF BUSES. ON HIGHWAYS IN CALIFORNIA THAT HAVE NO STEERING WHEEL. ON THAT HAVE NO BREAK. AND ARE GOING TO HAVE PEOPLE ON THEM THEY'RE GONNA DOT THERE SUPPOSED TO BE THIS FIRST MILE LAST MILE THING THAT GOES TWELVE MILES AN HOUR. THE ENTITY THAT IS IN CHARGE OF THE TESTING IS A TRANSIT AGENCY. PEOPLE WITH BASICALLY NO EXPERTISE ON HOW YOU TEST VEHICLES FOR SAFETY THAT'S NOT WHAT THEY DO THEY BUY VEHICLES ARE ALREADY APPROVED FOR TESTING. AND BEING CONDUCTED BY THE MANUFACTURER WITH THEM WITH THAT WITH ECONOMIC INTEREST IN THE OUTCOME OF THE TESTING ALL ALONG WITH THE TRANSIT AGENCY WHO DOES A PRESS RELEASE SAYING WE'RE GOING TO BE THE CENTER OF THE FUTURE. OF AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES THAT'S NOT WHO SHOULD BE TESTING THESE THINGS SKEPTICS SHOULD BE TESTING THE SEX NOT PEOPLE WHO HAVE ANNOUNCED THEIR THAT THEY'RE IN LOVE WITH THE WHOLE THING. AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE AT THE CENTER UP SOME FUTURE WORLD OF GOVERNMENT ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN ADVANCE OF THE TESTING. SO THAT'S ALL HOLE PUT NUMBER OF THE ISSUES THAT THAT HAVEN'T BEEN DEALT WITH THAT I THINK THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO GET INTO. I THINK YOU FOLKS NEED TO REALLY WAY INTO THIS. SECONDLY. AND I ALLUDED TO THIS. WORST WHAT'S THE REAL TRANSPARENCY HERE WHAT IS STOP PUBLIC GET TEN NO. ABOUT THESE WOULD DO WE GET TO KNOW EVERY COMPETE COMPUTER FAILURE. DO WE GET TO KNOW. HOW OFTEN THERE'S? UP POTENTIAL NEAR MESS I MEAN I WHO KNOW WHO I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE REALLY KNOW I KNOW THAT THEY RELEASE WHEN THERE'S AN ACCIDENT. WHEN THERE'S AN INCIDENT BUT HEY WE'VE ALL DRIVEN CARS THERE'S A WHOLE LOT MORE MAYBE ALMOST SORDID INCIDENTS. THAT HAPPENED WITH VEHICLES AND AS LONG AS PEOPLE ARE GONNA BE DRIVING VEHICLES AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE SHARING THE ROAD WITH FULLY AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES THERE'S GOING TO BE A COLLISION. OF TALENTS AND LESS THAN COUNTS JUST AS THE GENTLEMAN TO MY LEFT INDICATED. CARS AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES MAY BE BETTER AT SOME THINGS AND PEOPLE MAY BE BETTER AT OTHER THINGS. AND THAT MADE NOT BE SOMETHING THAT THE A COMPUTER WELL ALL WILL BE ABLE TO OVERCOME. AND AND SO THAT'S AN ISSUE WHAT DO WE KNOW. AND WHEN ARE WE GOING TO KNOW IT AND LASTLY AND THIS IS A CLASSIC AREA OF LEGISLATIVE. ACTIVITY. WHAT IS REALLY GOING ON HERE IN THE LIABILITY INSURANCE MARKET RELATED TO THIS? WHAT DO ARE WE ALL SUPPOSED TO BUY? AUTO INSURANCE. ON AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE. IN WHICH WE DON'T OPERATE IT. WHEN THE RISK OF THE INSURANCE IS SUPPOSED TO BE ENSURING US AGAINST OUR NEGLIGENCE. IS THAT FAIR. OR SHOULD ALL THIS BE. A WARRANTY OF THE MANUFACTURER SHOULD IF BIG CANDLES OF FULLY AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE WHY AREN'T THEY A HUNDRED PERCENT LIABLE. STRICTLY LIABLE IN TORT FOR ANY ACCIDENT THAT OCCURS IT'S NOT MONEY DRIVING ERROR. AYE SHOULD BE PAYING INSURANCE FOR SOMETHING THAT'S ATTRIBUTABLE TO ME. NOT TO A FAILURE OF THE MANUFACTURE. NONE AND SO THAT IS AN AREA THAT THE LEGISLATURE REALLY OUGHT TO BE LOOKING AT. BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOME OF THESE COMPANIES. SAYING THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE. DEPLOYING THESE VEHICLES AS SOON AS THEY CAN. AND THAT COULD BE. WHAT WITHIN A YEAR TO YEAR TOP WHEN ARE THEY ACTUALLY GOING TO BE DOING IT? AND WHAT DOES IT MEAN WHEN WE HAVEN'T EVEN LOOKED AT THESE ISSUES. SO. HOME YOU KNOW THERE'S THAT OLD STATEMENT. YOU KNOW FOOLS RUSH IN WHERE ANGELS DARE TO TREAD AND I THINK IF YOU LISTEN TO WHAT. IT'S BEEN SAID TODAY BY EVERYBODY ON THIS PANEL AND EVERYBODY ON THE PANEL BEFORE. YOU KNOW A A A A A TRUER STATEMENT WAS NEVER MADE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER BRODER TOLD USE GOOD. GLAZER JONES CAN GET RID. MISTER BERMAN HAD A COUPLE QUESTIONS OF THE PANEL WELL THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH IN AND I APOLOGIZE AFTER THE BRIEF BECAUSE I HAVE TO GO FOR A PREP CALL FOR. THOMAS VEHICLE PENAL I'M SERVING ON THE MORROW. BUT I THINK IT'S SOME VERY GOOD QUESTIONS IN ISSUES WERE RAISED. AND I WISH I'M GONNA TRY TO MAKE IT BACK. TO HEAR FROM THE. FROM THE THIRD PANEL HOPEFULLY THEY ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS I MEAN THERE ARE LEGITIMATE CONCERNS. ABOUT AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES AND I THINK. THERE ARE THRESHOLD QUESTIONS ONE IS ARE THEY GONNA BE GOOD FOR SOCIETY OR ARE THEY GONNA BE THAT NEXT STEP OF THE APOCALYPSE. ON AND WHAT YOU GET PAST THAT IF YOU CAN GET PAST THAT THEN THERE ARE SERIOUS QUESTIONS AS TO HOW YOU DEPLOY IT HOW YOU TO PLAY IT SAFELY. I GIVE MY FIRST HEAD X. TALKING TO THOMAS VEHICLES FOR YEARS AGO. AND AND. TALKED TO A LOT OF PEOPLE IT IN PREP FOR FOR PUTTING TOGETHER THE TALK WHO HAVE A LOT OF CONCERNS ABOUT CYBERSECURITY I MEAN ABOUT HACKING. ABOUT PRIVACY ABOUT WE NEED TO COME UP IN AND CREATE A REGULATORY AND INSURANCE FRAMEWORK AND HOW THAT'S GONNA. AGO WHEN ALL I WAS HAPPY TO HEAR MY FRIEND MR BROAD. AS YOU KNOW EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE LEGISLATURE IN THAT BECAUSE LAST YEAR WHEN I HAD A BILL ON TRYING TO CREATE A TESTING PROGRAM FOR A THOMAS FREIGHT. ó IT WAS OPPOSED VEHEMENTLY BY MY FRIEND MISTER BROAD. AS WELL AS BY THE TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY SO I FOUND MYSELF IN THIS AWESOME SITUATION WHERE EVERYONE HATED MY. BUT BUT I DO THINK IT'S A ROLE THAT WE NEED TO PLAY I THINK WE NEED PARTNERS FROM ALL SIDES TO PARTICIPATE CONSTRUCTIVELY IN THAT CONVERSATION. AND AND YOU KNOW A COUPLE OF FOLKS TALK ABOUT SAFETY AND AND A. IT BROUGHT UP THE QUESTION. YEAH I'M VERY YOU MENTIONED YOU KNOW WHAT'S OF THE SAFETY STANDARD BE AND IF IT TOO IF YOU'RE FULLY AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES SHOULD THERE BE NO DEATHS. ALRIGHT WELL CURRENTLY WE HAVE THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND DEATHS BY AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENT EVERY YEAR IN IN THE UNITED STATES SO THAT'S THE STATE THAT'S. KIND OF. THE. THE BASELINE IF YOU WILL AND AND SO THIRTY FOR THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND WE'VE ACCEPTED THAT IS THAT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY FOR THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND PEOPLE TO DIE EVERY YEAR BECAUSE PEOPLE MAKE MISTAKES AND CRASH INTO EACH OTHER. AND. SO IS IS A LIFE THAT'S TAKING IN BECAUSE OVER HUMAN ACCIDENT WORTH LAST THEN A LIFE THAT WOULD BE TAKEN BY THE THEN ACCIDENT FROM TECHNOLOGY. BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHEN YOU SAY THAT THAT IF ONE ACCIDENT YEAH I MEAN OF ONE PERSON DIES FROM A THOMAS VEHICLES THAT'S TOO MUCH OR WHAT'S THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND. BECAUSE THAT WAY TOO MUCH I APPRECIATE THAT AND SO YOU KNOW HOW CAN WE. ARE ON AYE AND AND THEN I I AM. TOTALLY AGREE WE NEED TO BE COGNIZANT. OF THE IMPACT IT'S GOING TO HAVE ON JOBS WE NEED TO AND AND THE TEAMSTERS AND I ACTUALLY WORK TOGETHER A WITH A TECHNOLOGY COMPANY IN MY DISTRICT. ON ON. PLATOONING TECHNOLOGY IN TRUCKS AND I THOUGHT WE HAD A GREAT CONVERSATION AND WAS REALLY GLAD YEAH THERE WERE ABLE TO DO THAT TO DEPLOY TECHNOLOGY BUT NOT IMPACT JOBS. AND SO THERE NEED TO BE THOSE CONVERSATIONS ALSO BUT. YOU KNOW LET'S LET'S KEEP THINGS IN PERSPECTIVE. AND AND FOR ME. YOU KNOW IT YOU THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND PEOPLE DYING EVERY YEAR IS WAY TOO MUCH. A AND I DO THINK THAT WE NEED TO DEPLOY TECHNOLOGY VERY CAREFULLY. AYE AYE SAID THIS FOUR YEARS AGO THAT. THE TECHNOLOGY IS GOING TO BE READY WAY BEFORE WHAT WAY EARLIER THAN WE ARE. AND I THINK THAT'S THAT'S DEFINITELY THE CASE. BUT LET'S LET'S KIND OF YOU KNOW TRY TO KEEP THE BIG PICTURE IN MIND WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOME THESE ISSUES SO I APOLOGIZE AFTER RUNNING TO TRY TO MAKE IT BACK OF THIS VEHICLE CALL. OF THE THANK YOU AND REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO A LOT MORE CONVERSATIONS. HE'S MOVING FORWARD. THANK YOU MISTER BURN. A MISTER I KANSEN CHU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. IT WAS SO VERY LIVELY DISCUSSION AND YOU KNOW THAT THEIR TECHNOLOGIES THIS EVOLVING EVERY DAY. AND WELL WE CAN'T ANTICIPATE. THAT DOES SOME DAY YOU ALL THE TRUCKS ON THE ROAD WILL BE A YOU KNOW A LOT OF SELF DRIVING AUTONOMOUS. AND MY CONCERN WAS TOO GOOD TEN THOUSAND THOUSANDS HOPE A. LITTLE TOO SLOW TRUCK DRIVERS AND AND GO WILL SO I WOULD LIKE TO. MAYBE. MISS HER BROW CAN TOUCH LITTLE BIT ALCOHOL. SURE WE HOW CAN WE AS THE STATE LEGISLATURE TO. TWO OF THE TO CONSIDER HELPING THOSE WHO ARE CURRENT. WORK FORCE SOONER DROPPED THE TRUCK DRIVERS TO TRANSITION INTO OTHER PROFESSIONS. WELL IT'S PROBABLY. BEYOND THE SCOPE OF THIS HEARING BUT AND BECAUSE IT'S A BIG TOPIC AND THAT THAT THE ESTIMATES ARE THAT. IN THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS DEPENDING ON THE ROLL OUT OF THIS TECHNOLOGY THAT SOMEWHERE AROUND TEN MILLION PEOPLE WILL LOSE THEIR JOBS. JOHN THAT'S A LOT OF PEOPLE. AND THEN IN IN MANY OTHER INDUSTRIES SO THE QUESTION IS WHETHER DO YOU TRAIN THEM FOR ANOTHER INDUSTRY. YOU GIVE THEM SORT OF JOB TRAINING THAT'S SORT OF THE TRADITIONAL. THING STRATEGY. UPON IT MAY NOT BE A STRATEGY THAT WORKS. IF WERE FACING A FUTURE IN WHICH THERE ARE. THERE'S NO JOBS TO GO TO IN OTHER WORDS IF YOU KEEP. IF THE PACE OF AUTOMATION YOU KNOW FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY TO NOW IS LIKE THIS WE MAY HAVE A PACE OF AUTOMATION THAT GOES LIKE THIS. AND WE MAY BE FACING SOMETHING FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT IN OUR SOCIETY WHICH FUTURE LEGISLATURE'S BUT MAYBE THAT NOT. FOR THAT NOT THAT FAR IN THE FUTURE WILL BE FACING WHICH IS. THE IDEA THAT THERE WILL BE. MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE DETACHED PERMANENTLY FROM THE LABOR MARKET. AND THE LOOPHOLE CONCEPT OF THE LABOR THEORY OF VALUE WILL BE UNDER CHALLENGE SO I'D LIKE TO SAY IT'S EASY TO SAY TRAIN PEOPLE FOR ANOTHER JOB. BUT THERE MAY NOT BE ANOTHER JOB. BECAUSE THAT GOES AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES ARE NOT THE ONLY PLACE WHERE AUTOMATION IS OCCURRING IT'S OCCURRING. EVERYWHERE ACROSS THE ECONOMY VERY BROADLY FROM. YOU KNOW FARMWORKERS TO RESTAURANTS TO HOTELS TO AIRPORT MEETS EVERYWHERE AND WOULD BE NAIVE TO THINK THAT. THAT YOU KNOW TEACHING IT IT'S WE NOT NAIVE TO THINK THAT THAT GENERAL TREND WILL NOT. MUCH CHANGE IN WE MAY HAVE TO THINK MUCH IN A MUCH BIGGER WAY AND WAY MORE CREATIVELY THAN JUST DRAW JOB TRAINING I I CAN'T TELL YOU AS I SIT HERE TODAY AND I I MEAN THAT'S VERY SINCERELY. I CAN'T TELL YOU AS I SIT HERE TODAY WHAT THE ANSWER IS TO THAT PROBLEM. MIDDLE ONE TRADITIONAL ANSWER FRANKLY WAS THAT'S HOW THEY WENT FROM THE SIXTY HOUR WORK WEEK TO THE FORTY HOUR WORK WEEK DURING ANOTHER PERIOD OF INTENSE AUTOMATION AND WHICH THEY SPREAD THE WORK AROUND. THAT WAS PART OF IT TO MAKE PEOPLE WORK LAST TO HAVE A BETTER LIFE AND TO SHORTEN THE WORK WEEK AND IN GERMANY NOW THERE ARE ON THIS THE. BIG INDUSTRIAL MANUFACTURING EMPLOYERS AND THEIR UNIONS BECAUSE THEY DO SECTOR BARGAINING. JUST AGREED TO I BELIEVE IT'S THE TWENTY EIGHT HOUR WORK WEEK. AS A FULL AS A FULL TIME JOB. BECAUSE OF THE ADVANCE OF TECHNOLOGY FOR THIS PURPOSE AND WHILE THAT MIGHT SOUND. WAY OUT THERE. IT MAYBE IT ISN'T MAYBE WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS SPREAD WORK TO THE ENTIRE POPULATION AS THE NUMBER LITERALLY THE NUMBER OF JOBS TO BE PERFORMED BY HUMAN. SO I I WISH I HAD A PAT ANSWER FOR YOU. BUT I DON'T. FONG. UP I. I APPRECIATE THE PANEL I THINK YOU. PROVIDED SOME VERY LARGE. CONCEPTUAL CONCEPTS THAT WE HAVE TO DIGEST IN AND. REPREHENSIBLE AND I GUESS WE CAN MAKE A DRILL DOWN WITH AT LEAST WITH THE INSURANCE HAVE FOLKS. WHAT CRITERIA ARE YOU GUYS YOU UTILIZING OR HAVE DEVELOPED TO AND? IN TERMS OF ENSURING AUTOMATED. VEHICLES ON THE ROADS IF YOU HAVE THAT. I MEAN I THINK THAT THAT THAT IS PART OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF UNDERSTANDING THE TECHNOLOGY ITSELF WE CERTAINLY ARE IT IT'S IT MIGHT ASSOCIATION REPRESENTS ARE BOTH COMMERCIAL INSURERS AND PERSONAL INSURANCE I THINK ONCE WE SEE PUBLIC DEPLOYMENT. OF THESE IN OUR ARE THERE ACTUALLY SOLD ON TO INDIVIDUALS THAT WILL SEE THAT INVOLVING THINK WE SEE THAT COMING AND AND WE DON'T KNOW RIGHT NOW IS THE ANSWER. WERE WERE. OBSERVING. THE TEST JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE TO FIGURE OUT. WHAT THE PRODUCT LOOKS LIKE IT THINK MISTER BROAD? BROUGHT UP BUT THE STINK WHITE WE COULD DEEP DIVE I THINK IN JUST THE LIABILITY ISSUES. AND HOW THAT WORKS OUT WITH ON SADDAM ITS VEHICLES A. AND MAY PROBLEMS OUTSIDE THE SCOPE HEARING TODAY. WE'RE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND. THE TECHNOLOGY ITSELF AND THE NOW THAT'S GOING TO INTEGRATE WITH OUR CURRENT TOWARD. LIABILITY SYSTEM THAT WE USE. IN THE IN THE BOTH PERSONAL CO COMMERCIAL AROUND SO I YOU KNOW THAT THE CRITERIA TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. OF I DON'T KNOW WE'RE LOOKING AT I THINK LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE INTERESTED ON STAKEHOLDERS. AS TO THE THE POTENTIAL FOR THIS TECHNOLOGY WHICH TO BE CLEAR WERE BULLISH ON AND AND WE THINK THAT IT'S SOMETHING. THAT. KING CAN CREATE MORE STICK IT EVENTUALLY CAN BECOME AND SAFER AND MORE EFFICIENT ALWAYS TRAVEL. IN IN ENTERS OF THE JUST WILL QUICKLY INTO THIS THE STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS OF WHO'S INVOLVED IN INTERNET THE STATE. I MEAN THAT YOU'RE MORE MORE GENERALLY SPEAKING SO I THINK EVERYBODY'S WE HEAR FROM CONSUMER ADVOCATES INSURERS MANUFACTURERS TECHNOLOGY GROUPS EXCEPT. OKAY THANK YOU BYE AYE I THINK BROADLY OUT OF SAY THAT WE WE ARE GOING TO SOME TYPE OF YOU KNOW INDEX REVOLUTION THERE'S GOING TO BE. TECHNOLOGY ADVANCEMENTS PROBABLY THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN I I DO GOODNESS BROUGHT THAT. IN THEN IN THE NEXT TEN YEARS OF THE JUSTICE. INNOVATIVE IN THE PAST FIFTY. I THINK WE DO HAVE TO. FIND A WAY TO PRIORITIZE SAFETY AS VISIT IN SPECIFICS WITH WITH AUTOMATED. VEHICLES AS WELL AS JOBS INNOVATION AND KILL OUR STATE HAS A LONG HISTORY OF IT INNOVATION THAT WE. THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO BE LATER ON AND SO I'M NOT SURE IF WE WILL AS A LEGISLATURE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T STIFLE INNOVATION BUT ALSO MAINTAIN. SET TYPE OF. ABILITY TO ENSURE THAT. INDIVIDUALS HAVE THE ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY TO TO TO UP TO LIVE LOOK AT THE STATE SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MISTER PHONE CONSUMER GOODS SETH. SO DO YOU THINK THE UTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY IS DOING ENOUGH. I TO PROTECT ITS VEHICLES FROM HACKING AT THIS POINT. SO IT DIFFICULT TO SAY PARTLY BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY UNKNOWN UNKNOWNS IN. INFORMATION SECURITY. AND THERE ARE SO MANY ENTIRE CLASSES OF VULNERABILITIES THAT ARE STILL BEING DISCOVERED. I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT THEY'RE WORKING PRETTY HARD ON IT. I THINK. SINCE. THE FIELD IS SO NEW THERE'S JUST A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY OUT THERE. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE COLLABORATION WITH INDEPENDENT RESEARCHERS ON WITH ACADEMIC RESEARCHERS WHO ARE OFTEN PEOPLE WHOM WE REPRESENT AND GIVE LEGAL ADVICE TO. WHO ARE ALSO WORKING IN THIS AREA AND WHO ARE OFTEN THE ONES WHO DISCOVER? SOME OF THE NEW THINGS THAT PEOPLE NEED TO BE WORRYING ABOUT. I DEFINITELY DON'T WANT TO SUGGEST THAT THE MANUFACTURERS ARE JUST SORT OF. FALLING ASLEEP AND. COMPLETELY IGNORING THE ISSUE IN FACT THEY'RE WORKING ON IT QUITE HARD. THERE'S JUST SORT OF THE UNKNOWN UNKNOWNS PHENOMENON OF. IS THAT ENOUGH. WHAT IS NECESSARY? SO IS THERE A. POSSIBILITY CREATED A COMPUTER SYSTEM THOSE. CRASH PROOF. SO I THOUGHT IT'S INTERESTING TO COMPARE WITH THE EXPERIENCE OF. AVIATION. WHICH HAS HAD AUTONOMOUS. SOFTWARE CONTROLLED NAVIGATION FOR A LONG TIME NOW. AND A LOT OF THE TIME WHEN YOU'RE ON A COMMERCIAL. AIRLINE. THE PILOT IS NOT IN FACT DIRECTLY INTERACTIVELY CONTROLLING. THE MOVEMENT OF THE AIRPLANE BECAUSE THE AUTO PILOTS ARE VERY EFFECTIVE. AND THEY'RE USED A LOT OF THE TIME. NOW. THE. IF YOU ISSUE INDUSTRY IS VERY VERY HIGHLY REGULATED. AND THEY'VE SPENT ENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF MONEY ON SOFTWARE QUALITY ASSURANCE. THAT'S REALLY THE ENVY OF THE REST OF THE IT WORLD. AND. I THINK THERE IS A QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER THAT KIND OF LEVEL OF INVESTMENT. IN QUALITY ASSURANCE IS. NECESSARY IN ORDER TO REACH THAT LEVEL OF ASSURANCE BECAUSE THEY. THEY'VE REACHED A VERY ADMIRABLE SAFETY RECORD INCLUDING FOR AUTONOMOUS PHASES OF FLIGHT. AND THEY'VE REACHED THAT BY SPENDING A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY AND A GREAT DEAL OF ENGINEERING EFFORT ON THAT AND SO I THINK THERE'S A QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER THAT LEVEL OF ASSURANCE. IS GOING TO REQUIRE PUTTING INCOMPARABLE RESOURCES IN THE AUTOMOTIVE FIELD AS WELL. HA AND I THINK IT MAY TURN OUT THAT IT DOES WHICH MAY BE A BIT UNCOMFORTABLE. TO PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF WHO WERE USED TO JUST SORT OF SITTING DOWN AND KNOCKING OUT A COMPUTER PROGRAM. NOT TO SUGGEST THAT THAT'S WHAT THE SELF DRIVING SOFTWARE IS LIKE. BUT. THE AVIATION PEOPLE I MEAN YOU CAN TALK TO SOME OF THEM. THEY WRITE FORMAL SPECIFICATIONS AND THEY HAVE SO MANY FORMAL PROCESSES AND SO MANY TOOLS. TO REALLY GET THE BUGS OUT OF THEIR SOFTWARE. AT GREAT EXPENSE HAND IT MAY TURN OUT TO BE THAT FOR. THAT LEVEL OF RELIABILITY THAT WE EFFECTIVELY NEED TO GO THERE WITH THAT KIND OF METHODOLOGY. THANK YOU. SO ROSEMARY. YOU'VE BEEN SITTING IMPATIENTLY THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY ADDITIONAL STEPS CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THE SAFE TESTING. AUTOMATED. AUTOMATED OF VEHICLES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THE QUESTION CHAIRMAN FRAZIER. WE HAVE RECOMMENDED SEVERAL THINGS THAT WE AS A STATE CAN DO. TO IMPROVE SAFETY AND NUMBER ONE WOULD BE. TO REQUIRE A RIGOROUSLY PROVEN TRACK RECORD OF SAFE OPERATION WITHOUT DISENGAGEMENT IN ALL KINDS OF TRAFFIC CONDITIONS IN VARIOUS WEATHER CONDITIONS. INCLUDING FOG RAIN HEAVY SMOKE AND SNOW BECAUSE. EVEN THOUGH IT'S ALMOST ALWAYS GORGEOUS AND SUNNY IN CALIFORNIA. WE DO HAVE DIFFERENT WEATHER PATTERNS AND AND WITH CLIMATE CHANGE ESPECIALLY WHERE YOU SEE MORE OF THAT. BEFORE THE VEHICLES ARE SOLD TO THE PUBLIC. AND. REQUIRING THE AV'S PASS A DRIVER'S TEST SHOWING THAT THEY CAN SEE. OBJECTS IN THE ROAD BEFORE THEM. INCLUDING STATIONARY OBJECTS OR OBJECTS THAT ARE MOVING AND APPARENTLY THERE ARE SOME VEHICLES THAT ARE BETTER AT THAT THAN OTHERS. THEY'RE CURRENTLY BEING SOLD AND PROHIBIT. SALES OF LEVEL THREE AND FOUR VEHICLES. AND I KNOW THERE'S SOME MANUFACTURERS WHO DIFFER IN THEIR OPINION OF WHETHER THAT'S A GOOD IDEA. BUT SOME MANUFACTURERS I THINK WOULD AGREE WITH US THAT. NOT SAFE TO RELY ON HUMAN DRIVERS NOT TO BECOME DISTRACTED AND. TO RELY ON THEM TO BE ABLE TO TAKE THE WHEEL A MOMENT'S NOTICE AND KNOW WHAT TO DO. EMERGENCY SITUATION. AND ESPECIALLY AS THE VEHICLES BECOME MORE COMMON YOU'RE DRIVING IS A SKILL TAKES A LOT OF EXPERIENCE TO BECOME A REALLY GOOD DRIVER. SO WE ARE CONCERNED TOO ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN. PEOPLE LOSE THAT SKILL AND HAVING DEVELOPED IT ARE THEY GOING TO BE ABLE TO TAKE OVER CONTROL. I'M MANDATE FULL PUBLIC DISCLOSURE AND REPORTING OF CRASHES INVOLVING AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES. NOT ALLOWING MANUFACTURERS OF THEIR VEHICLES TO HIDE BEHIND LIKE FORCED ARBITRATION WHICH IS A CLOSED FORM. IN SECRET. AND ESTABLISH REASONABLE STANDARDS FOR FINANCIAL STABILITY AND INSURANCE THE THRESHOLD IN. SENATOR PADILLA'S PHIL WAS FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. I'M. NOT SURE BUT I HAVE THE IMPRESSION THAT THAT WAS. WHAT WAS IN MY JUST FOR THE TESTING PHASE? SO FOR GOING TO ALLOW THE VEHICLES TO BE SOLD IN LARGE VOLUMES WE WANT TO HAVE ENTITIES THAT ARE FAR MORE SOLVENT THAN THAT. IN ONE LIFETIME EXPENSE FOR HEAD INJURED TEENAGER COST MORE THAN FIVE THOUSAND FIVE MILLION DOLLARS SO WE DON'T WANT TO BE IN A SITUATION WHERE. MORE. FLY BY NIGHT. ENTITIES ARE ENTERING INTO THIS SPACE AND OFFERING PRODUCTS AND THEN WHEN THERE'S A PROBLEM NOT BE ABLE TO STAND BEHIND THEM. AND ALSO PROHIBIT MISLEADING TERMINOLOGY IN FALSE ADVERTISING REGARDING AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES IT'S WE BELIEVE IT'S MISLEADING SOMETIMES IF. PEOPLE. ARE HYPED BY THE TERMINOLOGY AND THEY DON'T HAVE REASONABLE EXPECTATIONS. AND ALSO TO PROVIDE EDUCATION MULTIPLE LANGUAGES. NO LOT OF TIMES THE OWNERS MANUALS ARE ONLY IN ENGLISH. IF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO UNDERSTAND. HOW? WHAT IS EXPECTED OF THEM WHAT THEY CAN EXPECT TO THE VEHICLE IN ORDER FOR TO OPERATE SAFELY YOU HAVE TO THINK WE? HAVE A VERY DIVERSE POPULATION OUR STATE AND WE WANT ALL OF THEM TO BE SAFE. THANK YOU THANK YOU. SO VERY. LOT OF GOOD POINTS. MULTIPLICITY OPEN APPRECIATE THE. THE THOUGHTFULNESS ABOUT WHAT IS THE BAR. SAFETY IN. I THINK MISTER BERMAN HAD A. A GREAT. STATEMENT ABOUT YOU KNOW THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND. AND WE KNOW THE POTENTIAL OF. SAVING LIVES CAN BE HUGE. SO DO THE TEAMSTERS HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT LEVELS OF AUTOMATED TECHNOLOGY. THAT WOULD REQUIRE DRIVER TO TAKE OVER THE WHEEL UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS. WE DON'T. WITH NO BASICALLY WE DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT ALTHOUGH. NONE. I CAN TELL YOU FROM THE EXPERIENCE OF OUR MEMBERS WHO OPERATE LOCOMOTIVES. WHERE YOU GO LONG STRETCHES OF TIME? IN WHICH. THE TRAIN IS KIND OF RUNNING ITSELF AND THEN SOMETHING VERY JARRING CAN HAPPEN. LIKE A KID CAN RIDE UP ON A BIKE TOWARDS OF WRITTEN A CROSSING WAS SOMETHING SUDDENLY CAN HAPPEN. AND THEY DO REPORT THAT IN THOSE SITUATIONS IT'S A GOOD THING THERE'S A SECOND PERSON IN THAT LOCOMOTIVE WITH AND THERE'S TWO IN A FREIGHT LOCOMOTIVE BECAUSE. IT KEEPS YOU AWAKE AND ALERT AND WHEN YOU'RE WITH OTHER PEOPLE'S ANOTHER PERSON SO YOU CAN STAY AT THOSE CONTROLS. SO THERE ARE ISSUES. WHEN THERE'S IN ACTIVITY FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME THAT PEOPLE'S MINDS BEGIN TO WANDER SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO TRAIN DRIVERS HOW TO OPERATE. IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES. ON I JUST WANNA MAKE SOMETHING VERY CLEAR THAT THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT. FULLY AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES SOME POINT COULD SAVE LIVES THE POINT I WAS MAKING IS NOT. THAT THERE CAN NEVER BE A DEATH BUT WHAT IS THE STANDARD IT'S THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND PEOPLE ARE KILLED. ARE THEY WORKING IF THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE GET KILLED. EVERY YEAR PROBABLY NOT ARE THEY WORKING IF TWENTY PEOPLE GET KILLED EVERY YEAR PROBABLY I MEAN ANOTHER WORDS I'M JUST SAYING YOU HAVE TO HAVE A STANDARD OF WHAT. MEETS THE LEVEL OF SAFETY THAT. SAFETY EXPERTS THINK IS REASONABLE. TO REQUIRE NOT. THAT. THERE'S PERFECTION ALTHOUGH IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IF THEY'RE FULLY AUTONOMOUS THAT THE HOPE WOULD BE. THAT. IT THERE WOULD BE. VERY VERY FEW INJURIES AND DEATHS ON THE HIGHWAY WHICH WOULD BE AN ENORMOUS BENEFIT TO SOCIETY SOMEDAY IN THE FUTURE. THAT'S MY ONLY POINT ABOUT THAT. YEAH I KNOW THAT. THEY'D THROUGH CALTRANS ANOTHER DEPARTMENTS TREND TRANSPORTATION. IT'S CALLED DEATH BY MILE COMEY DESPERATE MILE WAS IN A CERTAIN. AREA BEFORE THEY RESPOND HARM TO MAKE SAFETY CONCERNS IN ON ROADWAYS SO AGAIN THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE. THE PEOPLE HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER TO YOU KNOW ESTABLISH. AGAIN. POINT WELL TAKEN. AND THE I THINK THAT. AS YOU HAD MENTIONED. THAT FOR EVERY. PROPONENT OF A OF A. OF A PART OF. AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES THERE SHOULD BE A CRITIC. TO BE ABLE TO CRITICIZE IT. TO THE NTH DEGREE SO THAT WE MAKE SURE THAT EVERYTHING IS BEEN RUN THROUGH ITS PACES. IT YOU KNOW BUMPY ROADS. THEY COULD ACTUALLY BE PART OF A. SOMETHING COMING LOOSE. OF OR WHATEVER SO I MEAN AGAIN THERE'S THERE'S TESTING IN AND THEN THERE'S TESTING. AND SO LOOKING FORWARD TO OF THIS CONTINUAL PRACTICE JUST AS WE HAD MENTIONED. THAT YOU WORKING WITH THE PUBLIC IF THERE'S A ROLL OUT OF OF THE TIMES VEHICLES IN THEIR CITIES THAT THEY'RE PUT ON NOTICE. THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE THERE. SO HOW WOULD THAT I WANT TO THANK THE PANEL FOR BEING HERE TODAY YOU CALL UP THE THIRD PANEL. VARYING GAUGE THANK YOU. WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND CALL UP JUST EARLY. HEAD OF POLICY FOR ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES WITH UBER. RUN MEDFORD DIRECTOR OF SAFETY FOR A MO. AND PAUL HILL BERS BALL CHIEF COUNSEL IN PUBLIC POLICY DIRECTOR TRANSPORTATION AS A SERVICE GENERAL MOTORS. JUSTIN WE'RE GONNA GO HEAD START WITH YOU. WHEN YOU'RE READY PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU. CHAIRMAN FRAZIER AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN TODAY'S HEARING. INTERFERE THOUGHTFUL APPROACH TO THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. MY NAME IS JUSTIN EHRLICH AND THE HEAD OF POLICY FOR. THE THAT THOMAS VEHICLE PROGRAM AT UBER BASIN SAM CISCO. AND I PREVIOUSLY SERVED AS A SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL COMMA HARRIS ADVISING A TECHNOLOGY PRIVACY AND SECURITY POLICY. HG ARE THOMAS UNIT IS A GROUP WITH THAT WITHIN OVER THAT WAS STARTED THREE YEARS AGO TO FOCUS ON VEHICLE AUTOMATION AND HAS GROWN OVER FIFTEEN HUNDRED EMPLOYEES. WITH OFFICES IN PITTSBURGH SAME CISCO PHOENIX IN TORONTO. I WE ARE DEVELOPING TO PRODUCTS SELF DRIVING CARS AS WELL AS SELF DRIVING COMMERCIAL VEHICLES. AT THE SAME TIME HOOVER'S CORE RIDE SHARING BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA HAS GROWN TO OVER SIX MILLION UNIQUE RIDERS AND MANY MORE ARE EXPERIENCING RIDE SHARING FOR THE FIRST TIME EVERY DAY. OUR MISSION IS TO IMPROVE URBAN MOBILITY AND MAKE CITIES MORE LIVABLE AND IMPROVE SAFETY AND EFFICIENCY OF THE ENTIRE TRANSPORTATION ECOSYSTEM. AND IN ADDITION TO IS A SELF DRIVING CARS ARE ALSO DEVELOPING SELF DRIVING TECHNOLOGY FOR COMMERCIAL MOTOR VEHICLES TO GENERATE SIMILAR SAFETY AND ECONOMIC BENEFITS IN THE FREIGHT INDUSTRY. AN INDUSTRY THAT IS PARTICULAR IMPORTANT IN CALIFORNIA. ON THE PASSENGER SIDE WE BELIEVE THAT. SELF DRIVING PASSENGER VEHICLES ARE VERY WELL SUITED FOR RIDE SHARE. OUR OUR VISION IS TO WORK TOWARDS OUR RIGHTS BUSINESS AND OUR SELF DRIVING WORK. TO UNIFY TOWARDS A SHARED ELECTRIC AUTONOMOUS FUTURE USE OF VEHICLES. SHARE USE WILL UNLOCK ALL OF. THE BENEFITS PROMISED BY LARGE SCALE DEPLOYMENTS OF BABIES IN URBAN AREAS NOT JUST IMPROVE SAFETY OUTCOMES BUT ALSO. WITH THE RIGHT POLICIES REDUCE CONGESTION EMISSIONS REDUCED PARKING DEMAND UTILIZATION OF TRANSIT ETCETERA. ARE IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN ALONE THIRTY FIVE MILLION UNIQUE WRITERS TOOK A SHARED TRIP AND REPORT. UBER IS UNIQUELY POSITIONED WITH A COMBINATION NETWORK HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE TO HELP LEAD INNOVATION AND SELF DRIVING AND WE HAVE A STRONG ENGINEERING GROUP INTERNALLY AS WELL AS WORKING WITH WORLD CLASS MANUFACTURING PARTNERS LIKE VOLVO AND DAIMLER. WE HAVE A CORE BUSINESS THAT POSSESSES THE PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE THAT COMES FROM RUNNING RIDE SHARING AND DELIVERY SERVICES MORE THAN SIX HUNDRED CITIES AND THE EXPERIENCE INTELLIGENCE THAT COMES FROM DOING BILLIONS OF TRIPS ON THE ROAD. IN MORE THAN SIXTY COUNTRIES. AND WE HAVE RECENTLY COMPLETED OVER FOUR BILLION TRIPS IN THE WORLD IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN ALONE. THAT EXPERIENCE THE OF CONNECTING WITH AND PICKING UP DROPPING OFF PASSENGERS. MAY SEEM ON THE MORE RUDIMENTARY SIDE BUT WE BELIEVE IT IS ACTUALLY QUITE PIVOTAL. A TO FUTURE DEPLOYMENT OF AV'S AND COMPLEX URBAN AREAS. I BELIEVE THE INNOVATION THE SPACE CAN ALSO BE GOOD FOR WORKING PEOPLE NOT JUST IN PROVIDING MORE RELIABLE AFFORDABLE TRANSPORTATION. BUT ALSO. FIND JOB OPPORTUNITIES AND TO TRANSFORM EXISTING INDUSTRIES LIKE FREIGHT AND LONG HAUL TRUCKING AND SHORT HAUL TRUCKING. FOR TRUCKING IN PARTICULAR IT IS ESSENTIAL TO THE US ECONOMY AND ACCORDING TO THE AMERICAN TRUCKING ASSOCIATION NEARLY SEVENTY PERCENT OF ALL THE FREIGHT TONNAGE MOVED IN THE U. S. IS BY TRUCKS. SEVEN POINT FOUR MILLION PEOPLE ARE EMPLOYED IN JOBS THEIR RELATED TRUCKINGIN TWENTY FIFTEEN. IT IS THE PREDOMINANT MODE OF FREIGHT TRANSPORTATION CALIFORNIA MOVING EVERYTHING FROM MANUFACTURED GOODS TO RESOURCE EXTRACTION LIKE LOGS AND SAND TO FOOD AND FARM TO MARKET PRODUCTS. IN FACT OVER SEVENTY EIGHT PERCENT OF ALL COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA PLANNED EXCLUSIVELY ON THEIR TRUCKS TO MOVE THEIR GOODS. CONSIDERING THE SCALE THE INDUSTRY AND ITS ROLE IN OUR STATE WE BELIEVE THAT IMPROVING SAFETY AND EFFICIENCY OF THE TRACKING SYSTEM SHOULD BE PRIORITIZED AND WILL GENERATE IMMENSE. BENEFITS IN CALIFORNIA AND BEYOND. AND TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL AS I MENTIONED WE ARE WORKING ON SELF DRIVING TRUCKS AS WELL AS UBER FREIGHT. WE MISSION SEE AN INDUSTRY. EARLIER THIS YEAR WE PUBLISHED OUR VISION FOR THE FUTURE OF TRUCKING. AND ENCOURAGE YOU TO ALL READ IT IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IT IS ON OUR BLOG. I IT IS WORTH MENTIONING THAT TODAY UBER FREIGHT A PHONE BASED BROKERAGE IS ADDRESSING SOME OF THE MOST PRESSING PAIN POINTS FOR TRUCK DRIVERS SUCH AS TRACING TRANSPARENCY. RELIABLE LOAD BOOKINGS AND FAST PAY. FREIGHT SERVES MANY SMALL BUSINESSES THAT ARE THE CORE OF THE TRUCKING INDUSTRY. FOR EXAMPLE CALIFORNIA'S HOME MORE THAN THIRTY THOUSAND TRUCKING COMPANIES MOST OF WHICH WERE LOCALLY OWNED SMALL BUSINESSES. AND SOME OF THESE ARE HOOVER'S PARTNERS ALREADY AND ARE BETTING FITTING FROM OUR INVEST IN THE INDUSTRY. LASTLY I'D LIKE TO VOICE THE. CONCERNED ABOUT THE IMPACTS OF TRUCKING AUTOMATION ON JOB OPPORTUNITIES. WE CERTAINLY DO NOT TAKE THIS CONCERN LIGHTLY. AND ACTUALLY WANTED TO UNDERSTAND THOSE IMPACTS AND SO WE TOOK IT UPON HERSELF TO CONDUCT AN IN DEPTH ECONOMIC ANALYSIS. WORKING WITH SOME ECONOMISTS TO HELP UNDERSTAND. ABOUT WHAT THE IMPACT WOULD BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT ARE CONSIDERATIONS OF OUR BUSINESS MODEL AND OUR DEPLOYMENT CURVES. ARE ANNOUNCES RECOGNIZE THAT THE SELF DRIVING TRUCKS WILL CERTAINLY CHANGE THE INDUSTRY. ARE AND IT WILL LEAD TO A SHIFT FROM LONG HAUL JOBS TO A LOCAL JOBS. BUT THAT IT ALSO MIGHT LEAD TO A GENERATION OF GROWTH IN THE SHORT HAUL JOB INDUSTRY. AND THE LOCAL TRUCKING SECTOR. WE PUBLISH ALL THOSE RESULTS AS WELL AS OPEN SOURCE THE MODEL ON OUR WEBSITE AND AGAIN ENCOURAGE ANYONE WHO'S INTERESTED TO TAKE A LOOK. FINALLY TURNING TO REGULATORY. WE APPLAUD THE DMV'S WORK LEADING A COLLABORATIVE PROCESS OVER MANY YEARS WITH MANY STAKEHOLDERS TO PRODUCE FINAL LIGHT VEHICLE REGULATIONS THAT PAVE A PATH THE FULL DEPLOYMENT OF DRIVERLESS PASSENGER CARS. THE DMV REGULATIONS THAT WENT INTO EFFECT ON APRIL FIRST REPRESENT A VERY THOUGHTFUL APPROACH TO TESTING AND DEPLOYMENT AUTONOMOUS CARS. AND ALONG WITH OTHERS IN THE INDUSTRY. WE WERE A HAPPY TO PARTICIPATE AND SUBMITTED COMMENTS RECOMMENDING CHANGES SOME MADE INTO THE FINAL REGULATIONS BUT OTHERS DO IT. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO ENGAGE THE DMV TO IMPLEMENT THE NEW ROSS. ANY CHANGES TO THOSE RECOMMEND. REGULATIONS WE. RECOMMEND BE CONSIDERED CAREFULLY AND AND USING ALL THE EVIDENCE. WITH LIGHT VEHICLE RULES FINALIZE WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE DMV AND CHP TURNING TO DEVELOPMENT OF RULES FOR HEAVY TRUCKS AND WE PLAN TO ACTIVELY PARTICIPATE IN THAT PROCESS. THE CPUC RECENTLY RELEASED A PROPOSED DECISION TO CREATE A PILOT PROGRAM ALLOWING LIMITED USE OF SELF DRIVING CARS TO CARRY PASSENGERS FROM THE PUBLIC WITHOUT COMPENSATION. AT THIS DECISION WOULD ALLOW COMPANIES THAT BOTH THE DMV PERMIT AND THE CPUC LIVERY PERMIT TO CARRY PASSENGERS. BUT WOULD IMPOSE ARRESTS AT AN ARRAY OF ADDITIONAL HURDLES DELAYS IN MANDATES AND WOULD NOT ACCOMMODATE DMV AB DEPLOYMENT PERMITS. WE BELIEVE THE PROPOSED DECISION. MIGHT IMPOSE REDUNDANT REQUIREMENTS AND ACTUALLY LIMIT THE ABILITIES. INDUSTRY'S ABILITY TO THE LEFT. DEVELOPED THE BEST CUSTOMER SOLUTIONS AND OTHERWISE UNDERCUT EXISTING STATE RULES TO AUTHORIZE ENCOURAGED DEPLOYMENT OF SELF DRIVING VEHICLES. SO WE AND OTHERS IN THE INDUSTRY HAVE URGED THE COMMISSION TO RESPECT THE DIEM THESE JURISDICTION OVER A BUREAU TESTING AND HARMONIZE ITS PROPOSAL WITH THE IN THE RULES. WITHOUT DRIVING PASSENGER SERVICE IN ITS INFANCY WE URGED THE COMMISSION PROVIDE SIMPLE GUIDANCE ON OPERATING DMB PERMITTED AV'S UNDER THE COMMISSION. EXISTING RULES. IN MARCH. A AND UBER TEST VEHICLE WAS INVOLVED IN A TRAGIC ACCIDENT INTENT BAY IN ARIZONA IN WHICH A PEDESTRIAN ELAINE HERTZBERG WAS FATALLY INJURED. OUT WE WERE SHOCKED AND SADDENED AT THESE. EVENTS. OUR OUR CEO HAS SAID IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE TEN BAY ANTS ACCIDENT WE ARE DOING A TOP TO BOTTOM REVIEW. OF OUR PROGRAM. THAT REVIEW IS ONGOING. BUT WE BELIEVE SELF DRIVING VEHICLES MAKE OUR ROADS SAFER AND WILL SAVE LIVES AND WE ARE COMMITTED TO MAKING THEM A SAFE AS POSSIBLE. WE WILL DEVELOP TEST AND DEPLOY THIS TECHNOLOGY WILL CONTINUE TO REVIEW AND IMPROVE IT TO ENSURE RIGOROUS SAFETY INSURANCES ARE IN PLACE. AS WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE FUTURE WE ARE EXCITED ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITY TO ANDREW'S MORE CALIFORNIANS TO SELF DRIVING TECHNOLOGY. THESE VEHICLES OFFER THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVE SAFETY AND EFFICIENCY OF THE PASSENGERS AND GOODS TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM. AND WE TRULY BELIEVE WILL IMPROVE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR MANY PEOPLE. WHO HAS COMMITTED TO CALIFORNIA OUR HOME IN THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH STATE LAWMAKERS REGULATORS ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS AND CITIES TO SAFELY IN A GREAT SELF DRIVING VEHICLES IN THE TRANSPORTATION SO? THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY IT PART IN TODAY'S HEARING I LOOK FOR TO ANSWERING ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH RON ARE GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN FRAZIER. I'M MY NAME'S RON MEDFORD AND I'M THE DIRECTOR SAFETY FOR WINDOW FORMALLY THE GOOGLE SELF DRIVING CAR PROJECT. AND WE'RE PROBABLY BASED HERE IN CALIFORNIA BUT THEIR HEADQUARTERS IN MOUNTAIN VIEW. MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL OFFICES IN SAN FRANCISCO IN A NINETY ONE ACRE TESTING FACILITY AT THE FORMER CASTLE AIRFORCE BASE THAT MERCED COUNTY. THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME HERE TODAY TO WRITE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF WHERE FULLY SELF DRIVING TECHNOLOGY STANDS CURRENTLY. WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY REMINDING EVERYONE OF THE POTENTIAL THAT FULLY SELF DRIVING CARS HAVE ON REDUCING THE GROWING NUMBER OF FATALITIES. THEIR CAR ON OUR NATION'S ROADS. AND TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THE LATEST YEAR OF COMPLETE DATA SHOWS THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY ONE PEOPLE. DIED IN TRAFFIC CRASHES. THIS IS MORE THAN A FIVE POINT SIX PERCENT INCREASE OVER TWENTY FIFTEEN. HERE IN CALIFORNIA TWENTY SIXTEEN SAW SEVEN PERCENT INCREASE IN TRAFFIC DEATHS COMPARED TO TWENTY FIFTEEN. RESULTED NEARLY THIRTY SEVEN HUNDRED DEATHS THAT YEAR. ONLY THE STATE OF TEXAS HAD MORE TRAFFIC DESTINED CALIFORNIA. CLEARLY THE NUMBERS ARE GOING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION. THIS IS IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY TODAY'S MANUFACTURING THE SAFEST CARS EVER BUILT IN TERMS OF TECHNOLOGY AVAILABLE. TO HELP DRIVERS PREVENT CRASHES AS WELL AS A DOCUMENT CRASH PROTECTION BUILT INTO EVERY CAR TODAY. BUT EVEN WITH THE MOST ADVANCED SAFETY MEASURES TODAY THE NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION ESTIMATES AT NINE FOUR PERCENT. OF ALL VEHICLE CRASHES ARE DUE TO HUMAN ERROR. THESE ERRORS RELATE TO DISTRACTION DROWSY DRIVING. DRIVING WHILE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF ALCOHOL AND DRUGS MISJUDGING GAPS AT INTERSECTIONS EXCESSIVE SPEEDS LIST GOES ON AND ON AND ON. FULLY SELF DRIVING CARS HAVE THE LIFESAVING POTENTIAL TO ELIMINATE MUCH OF THE HUMAN THEIR THAT LED TO THE SIX POINT THREE MILLION POLICE REPORTED CRASHES LAST YEAR IN THE UNITED STATES. WE BEGIN DEVELOPING AND TESTING AUTONOMOUS CARS ON PUBLIC ROADS RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA APPROXIMATE NINE YEARS AGO. AND WE HAVE BEEN DRIVEN AND WE'VE DRIVEN MORE THAN FIVE MILLION TARA SMILE SINCE WE STARTED. WE'RE PLEASED THAT CALIFORNIA DMV HAS COMPLETED ITS TESTING AN OPERATING REGULATIONS. NOW THERE'S REGULATORY FRAMEWORK HERE IN CALIFORNIA THAT ALLOWS FOR DRIVERLESS TESTING AND DEPLOYMENT. OF FULLY SELF DRIVING CARS. AS WE RECENTLY ANNOUNCED WAY MO HAS APPLIED TO THE DMV TO CONDUCT DRIVERLESS TESTING IN CALIFORNIA AND OUR APPLICATIONS CURRENTLY PENDING. WE'VE ALSO SUBMITTED TO THE PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSION A PROPOSAL FOR PAID DEPLOYMENT PILOT PROGRAMS THAT ALIGN WITH THE DMV'S DEPLOYMENT REGULATIONS. AS YOU MAY BE AWARE WAY WILL HAS ANNOUNCED THAT WE INTEND TO PROVIDE DRIVERLESS TASKER TRANSPORTATION THE SERVICE TO THE PUBLIC IN THE METRO PHOENIX AREA AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN. HERE IN CALIFORNIA THE PUBLIC UTILITIES AND HAS RECENTLY BEGUN ITS EFFORTS TO REVIVE BOTH AN INTERIM AND A LONG TERM REGULATORY FRAMEWORK TO INTEGRATE AB IS OUR SELF DRIVING VEHICLES. AS A ANOTHER PART FOR THE COMMERCIAL TRANSPORTATION NETWORK. WHEN I WAS PARTICIPATING THIS PROCESS BUT THE P. YOU SEE AS WE ARE EAGER TO LAUNCH HERE IN OUR HOME STATE OF CALIFORNIA. LAST OCTOBER WE ENTERED A NEW PHASE OF TESTING IN PHOENIX. WITHIN THIS NEW PHASE WE ARE RELYING ON OUR SAFEST AND MOST ADVANCED FULLY SELF DRIVING CARS TODAY BUILT ON THAT CHRYSLER PACIFICA HYBRID PLATFORM. WHERE TESTING JUST DRIVING AUTONOMOUS? AND AUTONOMOUS MODE WITHOUT A TEST DRIVER. BEHIND THE WHEEL. THESE TRAVELED THROUGH THE. THESE VEHICLES TRAVEL WITHIN A DEFINED GEOGRAPHIC AREA IN THE PHOENIX REGION WHERE THEY HAVE BEEN TESTED EXTENSIVELY. THESE VEHICLES WILL OPERATE ALONGSIDE OUR TESTING FLEE THE. WITH DRIVERS AND WILL CONTINUE. IN IN THE PHOENIX AREA FOR. SOME FORCE OF SIEBEL TIME. FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS WAY THOSE EARLY RIDER PROGRAM ALSO HAVE THE CHANCE TO ACCESS. FULLY SELF DRIVING CARS THESE RIDERS WILL THEN. FOR THE FIRST TIME HAVE THE ACCESS TO. DRIVE OUR CARS ARE NOT DRIVEN BY HUMANS. EVENTUALLY THIS AREA WILL GROW OVER TIME COVER OTHER LOCATIONS AS WELL. ARE FULLY SELF DRIVING SYSTEM IS DESIGNED TO SAFELY OPERATE WITHOUT HUMAN DRIVER AND WE HAVE SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED KEY FEATURES FOR THIS LEVEL AUTONOMY. OUTSIDE EL SELF DRIVING MINIVANS REQUEST WAS SWEETER SENSORS CAMERAS RADARS AND LASERS. THAT HAVE BEEN BUILT ENTIRELY IN HOUSE AND SPECIFICALLY FOR FULLY AUTONOMOUS DRIVING. WITH THESE SENSORS ARE CARS CAN SEE SIGNIFICANT FARTHER AND MORE ACTUALLY THAN A HUMAN CAN. FOR EXAMPLE OUR SENSORS ARE SO POWERFUL THAT THEY CAN SEE UP TO THREE HUNDRED METERS AWAY. THE LIKE OF NEARLY THIRTY. THREE FOOTBALL FIELDS. OF SELF DRIVE A MINI VANS RUN HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF HEALTH CHECKS EVERY SECOND AND ARE EQUIPPED WITH UNIQUE LEVEL FOR SAFETY FEATURES. SUCH AS BACKUP STEERING. BRAKING POWER AND COMPUTING. IF ANY ISSUE IS DETECTED ON THE ROAD THESE REDUNDANT SYSTEMS. CAN HELP OUR VEHICLE GET TO A DESTINATION SAFELY ARE BRING THE VEHICLE TO A SAFE STOP IF REQUIRED. AS A CALIFORNIA COMPANY WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT EXPANDING OPERATIONS HERE AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUED IN CLOSE COLLABORATION WITH STATE REGULATORS LIKE THE DMV IN THE P. YOU SEE. TO BRING THE PROMISE OF A TAKE AB TECHNOLOGY SAFELY. SAFETY AND SAFETY AND MOBILITY CALIFORNIA. ON BEHALF OF WHEN I WANT TO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN OF AND THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY. I JUST WANT TO MENTION THE AND THAT I THINK WE HANDED OUT. FIRST EVER. PUBLICATIONS THAT WE DID TO TRY TO EDUCATE PEOPLE ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGY HOW IT WORKS. AND THE SAFETY STEPS THAT WE TAKE TO TRY TO ENSURE THAT IT'S AS WE DEVELOP AND DEPLOY THE TECHNOLOGY THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU RUN MOVED FULL. CHAIRMAN FRAZIER AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M PAUL HAMMERS BOSS CHIEF COUNSEL AND POLICY DIRECTOR FOR TRANSPORTATION IS A SERVICE FOR GENERAL MOTORS. THANKS FOR INVITING ME HERE TODAY TO DISCUSS SELF DRIVING VEHICLES AND GM AND CREWS AUTOMATION'S PROGRAM FOR DEVELOPING MANUFACTURING TESTING AND DEPLOYING THEM. GM IS DRIVEN BY OUR GOAL FOR A FUTURE WITH ZERO CRASHES ZERO EMISSIONS AND ZERO CONGESTION. DEVELOPING AND DEPLOYING SELF DRIVING VEHICLES DESIGNED TO SERVE ALL THREE ELEMENTS OF THAT VISION. SAFETY IS OUR TOP PRIORITY. IT'S ALSO THE DRIVING MOTIVATION BEHIND SELF DRIVING VEHICLES EFFORTS. NEARLY FORTY THOUSAND PEOPLE ARE KILLED EACH YEAR IN THE UNITED STATES ROADS. THAT SHOULD BE SHOCKING. TO PUT IT IN CONTEXT IS THE EQUIVALENT OF A SEVEN FORTY SEVEN AIRPLANE CRASHING AND KILLING EVERYONE ON BOARD. EVERY WEEK. HERE IN CALIFORNIA MOTOR VEHICLE FATALITIES TOTAL THREE THREE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED EIGHTY IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. NHTSA ESTIMATES THAT NINETY FOUR PERCENT OF VEHICLE CRASHES ARE THE RESULT OF HUMAN ERROR OR BEHAVIOR. THIS MEANS THAT IF WE CAN REDUCE HUMAN ERROR WE CAN REDUCE THE NUMBER OF VEHICLE CRASHES AND FATALITIES. THIS IS THE GREAT PROMISE OF SELF DRIVE VEHICLES BY ELIMINATING THE HUMAN DRIVER ENHANCE HUMAN ERROR. WE CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE PUBLIC SAFETY OF OUR ROADS. SELF DRIVING VEHICLES WON'T GET DISTRACTED. THEY WON'T DRIVE DRUNK. AND THEY WON'T SPEED OR ENGAGE IN OTHER RISKY BEHAVIORS. THE SAME TIME. WINTER STAND THAT IN ORDER TO GAIN THE PUBLIC'S TRUST IN OUR TECHNOLOGY WE MUST SHOW THAT WE CAN SAFELY AND RELIABLY. DELIVER THEM TO THEIR DESIRED DESTINATIONS THAT'S Y. WE PUBLISHED OUR TWENTY EIGHTEEN SELF DRIVING SAFETY REPORT IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR. THIS REPORT DESCRIBES IN LAYMAN TERMS. HOW WE CONSTRUCTED DRIVE SELF DRIVING VEHICLE FROM THE GROUND UP? SAFETY IS OUR FOREMOST CONSIDERATION. THE REPORT DESCRIBES GM'S COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE SAFETY LEVERAGING MORE THAN A CENTURY OF EXPERIENCE AND SAFELY DESIGNING MANUFACTURING AND DEPLOYING VEHICLES. THE REPORT ALSO ADDRESSES ITS IS VOLUNTARY SAFETY SELF ASSESSMENT PROCESS OUTLINED IN ITS GUIDANCE VISION FOR SAFETY EIGHTY S. TO POINT OUT. SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSES EACH OF THE TWELVE SAFETY ELEMENTS THAT THE AGENCY ADVISE COMPANIES TO CONSIDER. WHEN DEVELOPING AUTOMATED TECHNOLOGIES. I THINK. AS AS WAY MODE DID WE. DISTRIBUTED A COPY OF THE GM REPORT I THINK. WE IN. GM AND WAY MORE THE ONLY TWO OF UP PUT THAT OUT SO FAR. THE REPORT. GM IS ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT IT'S PART OF OUR VISION FOR THE FUTURE WE BELIEVE THAT ALL SELF DRIVING VEHICLES SHOULD BE ELECTRIC VEHICLES. IN FACT. GM PLANS TO INTRODUCE TWENTY NEW ELECTRIC VEHICLES BY TWENTY TWENTY THREE. SELF DRIVING VEHICLES ARE A GOOD WAY TO DEPLOY ELECTRIFICATION AT SCALE. OUR SELF DRIVING VEHICLES TODAY ARE BUILT ON THE BOLT EVEY PLATFORM OUR AWARD WINNING ELECTRIC VEHICLE THAT CAN TRAVEL TWO HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT MILES ON A SINGLE CHARGE. THE BOLT HAS NO TAILPIPE EMISSIONS WHICH ADVANCES OUR GOAL OF ZERO EMISSIONS. WE BELIEVE THAT ELECTRIC VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY SHOULD BE THE FOUNDATION FOR SELF DRIVING VEHICLES AND CAR SHARING. AND A STARTING POINT TOWARD THE WORLD ZERO CRASHES ZERO EMISSIONS IN ZERO CONGESTION THAT WE SEEK. SPEAKING OF CONGESTION. IT'S AN INCREASING CONCERN ESPECIALLY IN THE URBAN CENTERS. GM BELIEVES ITSELF DRIVING AND ELECTRIC PROPULSION TECHNOLOGY CAN ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO ADDRESSING THE PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH CONGESTION. OUR PLAN IS TO DEPLOY OUR SELF DRIVING VEHICLES IN FLEETS THAT ARE OWNED BY GM NOT TO SELL THEM TO INDIVIDUALS. THAT WAY WE CAN ASSURE. THAT THEY ARE PROPERLY MAINTAINED AND UPDATED. IN ADDITION BY WORKING WITH THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH WE WILL OPERATE WE CAN FIND WAYS TO PROVIDE MOBILITY SOLUTIONS TO A GREATER NUMBER OF PEOPLE. AND AT THE SAME TIME REDUCE CONGESTION. SERVICES THE GM SWEETS MAY PROVIDE INCLUDE RIDE SHARING IT FIRST MILE LAST MILE SUPPLEMENTS TO PUBLIC TRANSIT. GM HAS DESIGNED AND BUILT SELF DRIVING VEHICLE FROM THE GROUND UP WITH SAFETY IS OUR TOP PRIORITY. OUR VEHICLES CURRENTLY IN ITS THIRD GENERATION IS THE ONLY SELF DRIVING VEHICLE THAT IS BEING MASS PRODUCED IN AN AUTOMOBILE PRODUCTION FACILITIES. THESE VEHICLES ARE CURRENTLY BEING MADE AT OUR ASSEMBLY PLANT IN LAKE ORIA IN MICHIGAN. WE CAN ACHIEVE OUR SAFETY COMMITMENT BY INTEGRATING SAFETY INTO THE SYSTEM TO THE VEHICLE AND BY CONFIGURING MULTIPLE LEVELS OF REDUNDANCY INTO EACH CRITICAL SAFETY SYSTEM. THIS PROCESS IS EXPLAINED AGAIN IN OUR SAFETY REPORT. MORE DETAILS. TODAY. EACH VEHICLE IN EACH VEHICLE WHERE TESTING WE HAVE TWO AUTOMATED VEHICLE TRAINERS ARE WHAT WE CALL AB TEASE ONE PERSON WHO SITS IN THE DRIVER SEAT TO CONSTANTLY MONITOR THE ROAD IN VEHICLE NAVIGATION. AND ANOTHER TO MAKE THEM AND RECORD OBSERVATIONS ABOUT THE VEHICLE'S PERFORMANCE. WE TRAIN OUR AB TEAS AND SAFE OPERATION OF VEHICLES IN REQUIRE BACKGROUND CHECKS AB TEAS ARE REQUIRED TO TAKE TRAINING IN THE CLASSROOM AND I CLOSE COURSES BEFORE THEY CAN OPERATE A CAR IN PUBLIC ROADS. WE'VE ESTABLISHED REQUIREMENTS LIMITING THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT AND AB T. CAN BE ON THE ROAD. THEY ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO UNDERGO CONTINUING TRAINING AFTER THEY HAVE BEGUN TO TEST OUR VEHICLES ON PUBLIC ROADS. WE MADE A CONSCIOUS DECISION TO TEST IN THE MOST CHALLENGING COMPLICATED ENVIRONMENT AVAILABLE DOWNTOWN SAN FRANCISCO. FROM PEDESTRIANS AND CYCLISTS A TROLLEY CARS AND FOOD TRUCKS EVEN. JAY WALKING OR COONS. HER HILLY SAN FRANCISCO ENVIRONMENT EXPOSES OUR VEHICLES TO ENDLESS CHALLENGES AND ENABLING THEM TO LEARN AND IMPROVE AT A RAPID PACE. TESTING ITS ABSENCE GO HAS SIGNIFICANTLY ACCELERATED OUR PROGRESS TO THE POINT THAT LATE LAST YEAR WE ANNOUNCED THAT WE EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO DEPLOY FULLY SELF DRIVING VEHICLES IN TWENTY NINETEEN. WHILE WE BELIEVE THIS GOAL IS ACHIEVABLE. OUR PROGRESS WILL ALWAYS BE GATED BY SAFETY. AS WE HAVE DONE SINCE OUR AB PROGRAM'S INCEPTION WILL NOT TAKE ANY STEPS. UNTIL WE ARE HIGHLY CONFIDENT THAT WE CAN DO IT SAFELY. PROTECTING THE SAFETY OF OUR CUSTOMERS AND THOSE SHARING THE ROADS OF THEIR VEHICLES IS OUR HIGHEST CONCERN AND PRIORITY. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR PROVIDING GM THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE OUR THOUGHTS AND I'D BE HAPPY TO ADDRESS ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU THIS REVIEW HAVE A QUESTIONS OF THE LECTURES SURE AND I APOLOGIZE FOR MISSING. NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF WHAT YOU HAD TO SAY. BUT JUST WANT TO GIVE YOU AN OPPORTUNITY ANY I THINK SOME LEGITIMATE CONCERNS WERE RAISED BY SOME OF THE PREVIOUS PANELS ARE NOT FORGIVE ME IF YOU'VE ALREADY ADDRESS THEM BUT. ME HOW ARE YOU. APPROACHING THINGS LIKE YOU KNOW PRIVACY CONCERNS OR THE HACK ABILITY. AT SOME OF THE OTHER CONCERNS THAT WOULD BE A BALD TIRES WHATEVER THAT WHATEVER THE COMMENT YOU KNOW WHATEVER THE. IT TURNS ARE HOW ARE YOU ADDRESSING THESE AS YOU AS YOU TESTS. YOUR TECHNOLOGY. OUR I CAN GO FIRST. ONE THING I WILL SAY IS THAT ON THE MAINTENANCE OR SAFETY OF THE OF THE VEHICLES THEMSELVES I MEAN WE WE'VE SAID THAT. RIGHT NOW ARE OUR BUSINESS PLAN IS FOR. PROVIDING TRANSPORTATION SERVICES APARTMENT CAPTURED FLEET SO WE. OWN AND MAINTAIN THOSE VEHICLES OURSELVES AND SO PROVIDING SERVICE AND ENSURING THAT THEY'RE SAFE. FROM THE NEEDED MAINTENANCE IS SOMETHING THAT WILL AND FOR THE FIRST FOR A STABLE FUTURE BE DOING OURSELVES. I THINK THAT. ON THE CYBER ON THE CYBER SIDE WE CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND AS WAS MENTIONED IT'S AND IT'S A CONSTANT ONGOING PROCESS YOU DON'T SOLVE IT IN A DAY YOU WORK ON IT EVERYDAY AND SO. THIS IS A PROCESS THAT WE. TAKES VERY SERIOUSLY AND WE YOU KNOW USE A LOTS OF. HELP AND AND GOOGLE AS PART OF THAT HELP BUT MORE THAN THAT. UNDERSTANDING THE VERBAL ABILITIES IN ADDRESSING THEM WERE PART OF THE OUT OF ICE ACT. IN AND. AND THERE'S A PROCESS BY SHARING INFORMATION THAT. ON A SUICIDE REISSUE SO THAT'S PART OF WHAT WE DO. I JUST ADD ON TO THAT WHAT I WE HAVE A A SIMILAR POTION ETHOS. I THINK OUT WITH REGARDS TO. A CYBER THAT THIS IS ACTION ISSUE THAT THE AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY MORE GENERALLY HAS TO GRAPPLE WITH THAT AND EXPENSE TO CONNECTED CARS AS WELL AND SO. I THINK ADAM. WHAT OUR APPROACH TO AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES IS IT IT NEED NOT BE SORT OF CONNECTED INTO THIS THE ITS SYSTEM? AND SO. ROUTE REDUCING THE THE THREAT FACTORS I AS PART OF OUR THING UP BUILDING AT AND THEN ON PRIVACY. I THINK WE HAVE EXPERIENCE THINKING ABOUT. CONSUMER PRIVACY ISSUES GIVEN THAT WE HAVE BEEN RUNNING A FLEET OF. HAVING THESE RIGHTS ARE PASSENGERS FOR MANY YEARS. SO WE THINK FIRST AND FOREMOST THEIR PRIVACY AND WE WE HAVE A PRIVACY. DESIGN TEAM WHO IS THINKING ABOUT HOW TO MAXIMIZE ALL OF THIS IN IN THE AV WORLD AND WILL BE HAVING MORE SENSORS ON THE. VEHICLE. I WANTED TO ADDRESS ONE THING IT DID THERE ARE SEVERAL OF THE WITNESSES SEEM TO. PROCEED FROM THE PREMISE THAT. AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES MUST BE PERFECT OR NEAR PERFECT. AND WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THESE VEHICLES OF THE STANDARD SHOULD BE. DO THESE VEHICLE SAVE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF LIVES. BECAUSE WE WE ARE LOSING THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND WATER SIXTY ONE LIVES. TWO YEARS AGO WAS MOST RECENT STATS. AND THE QUESTION SHOULDN'T BE OUR IS IT BECAUSE IT. STOPPING YOUR IN EVERY SINGLE SITUATION ARE ARE THEY NOT CRASHING OR IN EVERY SINGLE SITUATION DO THEY PREVENT. A CRASH FOR ONE THING IT WILL BE THIRTY YEARS BEFORE. AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES ARE THE ENTIRE CAR PARKED ON THE ROAD. I FOR A LONG TIME THEY WILL BE SHARING THE ROAD WITH. HUMAN DRIVERS AND MAYBE LONGER THAN THIRTY YEARS. BUT AT LEAST THIRTY YEARS SO SO I THINK THAT THAT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S SORT OF A. IN MY VIEW AND GM'S VIEW OF MISTAKEN FRAMING OF THE ISSUE. IT SHOULDN'T BE HOW CLOSE TO PERFECTION ARE WE IT SHOULD BE. ARE ARE WE SAVING A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF HUMAN LIVES ANOTHER THING ON ON CYBER. THAT WHEN THE PEOPLE TIME OUTSIDE WHAT WE DID AT OUR SUBSIDIARY CREWS AUTOMATION IS WE WENT OUT AND HIRED THE TO DEEP PACKERS. AND WE HAVE THEM DOT DOINGS ARE RED TEAM EVALUATION OF OUR. OUR TECHNOLOGY. ON AN ONGOING BASIS. IT IT'S IT'S CERTAINLY HE'S SABERS IS A BIG CHALLENGE AND I THINK MOST COMPANIES MOST AUTO COMPANIES AND MY FELLOW PANELISTS OF THEIR COMPANIES ARE VERY AWARE OF IT AND WORKING HARD ON IT BUT IT'S IT'S IT'S SOMETHING YOU HAVE TO BE. FOREVER VIGILANT ON. SO IT AND AND THEN I THINK THAT THE LAST THING I WANTED TO MENTION. WAS. THE INSURANCE IN THIS IS THIS IS A WHOLE KIND OF. SERIES OF CONSOLATION ISSUES BUT. INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE IN GENERAL ARE OUR ECONOMIC ACT LIKE ANYBODY ELSE AND THAT THEY SHOULDN'T BE ENTITLED TO PRIVATE INFORMATION ANY MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE IS MEAN THAT'S NOT HOW THEY DO IT NOW AND IF THEY WANT TO ENGAGE IN THAT. INSURANCE TRANSACTION WITH WITH AN AUTO COMPANY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. THEY CAN ASK THE COMPANY IF THEY CAN HAVE DATA AND THE COMPANY CAN CHOOSE TO PROVIDE IT OR NOT. BUT BUT I DON'T THINK THAT THERE SHOULD BE ANY SORT OF. PRESUMPTION THAT THEY'RE ENTITLED TO. ADDITIONAL DATA. MERELY BECAUSE OF THEIR INSURERS. THANKS. YEAH I APPRECIATE THE THE ANSWERS IT YEAH YOU KNOW JUST COME. MACRO COMMENTS I'VE IT WE'VE GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO. MAY I I THINK I SAID I CAN RIVERS ON THE COLLEGES HAD HER. BEFORE I LEFT HERE YOU KNOW THAT THAT THE TECHNOLOGY IS GOING TO BE READY BEFORE SOCIETY IS. I FOR ONE AM A BIG BELIEVER IN THE BENEFITS OF ECONOMIST TECHNOLOGY WHETHER IT'S THE SAFETY COMPONENT WHETHER IT'S HOW WE TOTALLY. CHANGE. ARE BUILT LANDSCAPE OF OF CITIES AND AND HOW MOBILITY AND HOW WE GET AROUND ALISON YOU CAN YOU CAN. THAT LEAST SO I POSITED FOUR YEARS AGO IN THIS TEXT TALK TURNED. PARKING GARAGES AND. INTO AN APARTMENT BUILDINGS ARE PARKS OR OTHER THINGS THAT HAVE A MASSIVE IMPACT BUT IT'S COMPLICATED. AND THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFICULT CONVERSATIONS THAT WE'RE GONNA NEED TO HAVE WITH EVERYBODY WHO SPOKEN TODAY. AND AND YEAH I'M THAT'S OUR JOB TO BRING EVERYBODY TOGETHER AND AND HASH OUT THOSE HARD CONVERSATIONS. AND HOPEFULLY PUT FORTH A REGULATORY FRAMEWORK THAT. BOTH PROMOTES. TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION AND BUT IS ALSO SAFE. AND THAT'S YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S THE DIFFICULT BALANCE THAT WILL HAVE MOVING FORWARD BUT APPRECIATE ALL AND EVERYONE ELSE'S COME TO SPEAK TODAY. ON LOOKING FOR MORE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT IT. THANK YOU MISTER BERMAN SO. THIS IS KIND OF A GENERAL FOR ALL OF YOU QUESTION FOR ALL OF YOU. SO WHAT IF ANY. INFRASTRUCTURE CHANGES DO WE. AS CAN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WOULD YOU SUGGEST THAT WE MAKE IN ORDER TO ACCOMMODATE. OF AUTOMATED VEHICLES ON THE ROAD. A WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE DIFFERENCES OF. URBAN RURAL. AND. ESERVER SUGGESTED. MODIFICATIONS THAT WE COULD BE MAKING TO CALTRANS TO. MAKE THIS INTEGRATION BETTER. I WAS LAST NIGHT OF THE FIRST TIMES OF THE FIRST THIS TIME. I THINK THAT FOR THE MOST PART A LOT OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE CHANGES THAT CITIES THINK ABOUT. ARE FOR VEHICLE TO VEHICLE. YOU KNOW IT OR VEHICLE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT KIND OF RADIO WAVE COMMUNICATION. FOR OUR VEHICLE WE WE DON'T USE THAT KIND OF COMMUNICATION SO WE WOULDN'T NEED THAT. WHAT WE ARE INTERESTED IN IS MORE? ELECTRICAL. INFRASTRUCTURE. AND THAT'S THAT INVOLVES A LOT OF DIFFERENT PLAYERS AND A LOT OF DIFFERENT INTERESTS AND SO FORTH AND SO IT'S. IT'S SOMETHING THAT IT'S VALUABLE IN AND WORTH WHILE TO START THINKING ABOUT TALKING ABOUT SOONER RATHER THAN LATER BECAUSE I THINK THAT THAT. AND TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU WANT ELECTRIC VEHICLES ON A CALIFORNIA IS IS HAS. A POLICY OF ENCOURAGING ELECTRIC VEHICLES. YOU'VE GOT HAVE CHARGES FOR THEM TO. FOR THEM TO BE A VIABLE METHOD OF OF MOST PEOPLE GETTING AROUND SO THAT THAT'S WHAT I WOULD SUGGEST. THE OTHERS. I TO OTHERS THAT HAD. SORT OF. INFRASTRUCTURE POLICY MORE BROADLY I THINK IN IT'S CRITICAL TO INTEGRATE. INTO PUBLIC TRANSIT AS WELL AS TO GENERAL. RIDESHARE TO START TO MAKE THE SHIFT AWAY FROM PARKING SPOTS ENABLE MORE A PICK UP AND DROP OFF LOCATIONS. AND THAT SORT OF CAN. YEAH I GO TO THE VISION A YOU DISCUSS THINGS I THINK THAT WILL TAKE A LOT OF WORK. AND WILL UNLOCK A LOT OF VALUE. A AND I THINK THE OTHER IS. AS DISCUSSED EARLIER IN PANELS THERE IS A RISK OF AS THE AV'S BECOME READILY MORE ACCESSIBLE WHICH IS GREAT TO INCREASE MOBILITY ACCESS THERE WILL BE. A HIGHER DEMAND AND SO THERE MAY RUN THE RISK OF CONGESTION SO UNLOCKING THE ABILITY TO. USE. POLICIES SUCH AS CONGESTION PRICING OR ENCOURAGE HIGH OCCUPANCY VEHICLE LANES ARE OTHER WAYS TO ENCOURAGE AT THESE AV'S P. SHARED. A AND POOLS I THINK WOULD BE CRITICAL FOR THEIR SUCCESSFUL DEPLOYMENT. WELL I I WOULD I WOULD JUST ADD THAT THE THE PARKING ISSUE WHERE THE THE PICK UP POINT ISSUE AND DROP OFF POINT ISSUE FOR. FOR PASSENGERS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT ONE AND I THINK YOU KNOW WE'VE WE'VE BEEN WORKING I'M SURE YOU'VE DONE A LOT OF US BUT WORKING WITH. IT'S THE CITIES AND LIKE IN THE SMALL AREAS AND. PHOENIX WERE ATTESTING TO AND THAT THE CITY SEEM TO BE VERY INTERESTED IN HELPING US FIND LOCATIONS ANYWHERE WHICH WE CAN. DO A SAFETY DROP OFF AND PICK UPS WITHOUT INTERFERING WITH TRAFFIC SOME MORE EMPHASIS ON ON THAT IS AN IMPORTANT ASPECT AYE I THINK FIXING POTHOLES THIS IS GOOD FOR OUR CUSTOMER SITE MOVIE. BIG GRAVE WE CAN JUST FIX MORE THE BOTTLES I THINK. HAS BEEN HAS BE ONE ON YOUR ON YOUR SERVICE. IT AT YOUR SERVICE. NOW. COMING NEAR YOU. NO THANK YOU FOR THAT AND AND ONE OF THE THINGS THEY AND WHEN YOU MENTION THE INFRASTRUCTURE. GOING FORWARD SO ARE WE LIMITING. TRAVEL OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS CONCENTRATION. ON. THIS VERY CONCENTRIC ISSUE AND SO DO I HAVE TO BUY A SEPARATE CAR. TO GO OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA WANT TO GO TO TEXAS OR IF I WANNA GO TO WYOMING BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT MOVING IN THIS DIRECTION. AND SO SAY I I COMMIT TO. THE. THE. THIS TECHNOLOGY. AND ALSO I GO TO THE BORDER AND I DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY FOR INFASTRUCTURE. UP BECAUSE IT THERE'D NOT CONCENTRATING ON LIKE WE SHOULD. I THINK THAT. ONE OF THINGS THAT RAISES IS QUESTION OF OF. UNIFORM FEDERAL POLICY VERSES A. STATE BY STATE POLICY AND. SOME OF THE FOLKS HERE WERE WERE ENCOURAGING YOU TO SOME OF THE EARLIER PANELS WE'RE ENCOURAGING YOU TO. AND ACT. LAWS GOVERNING THE PHYSICAL CAR. ARE AS A STATE AND A STATE BY STATE BASIS. IF WE DO THAT I THINK WILL END UP WITH THE SCENARIO THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE NEVADA MAY HAVE A DIFFERENT ONE MAY HAVE A DIFFERENT ONE FROM OREGON AND AND. YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA THIRD AND SO FORTH. SO THAT'S ONE OF THE FEATURES OF THAT. THE LEGISLATION THE FEDERAL LEGISLATION IS THAT IT KEEPS IN PLACE THE CURRENT ALLOCATION OF RESPONSIBILITIES BETWEEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THE STATE GOVERNMENTS. AND IT IT THE THINGS THAT NEED TO BE UNIFORM. ARE THIS RESPONSIBILITY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THAT THE LOCAL. MORE LOCAL AND STATE CONCERNS OUR RESPONSIBILITY OF THE STATE'S SO SO THAT'S I I THINK IMPORTANT. POLICY CONSIDERATIONS. AND WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT JUST WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT. YOU OVER FREIGHT. OH WE LOOK AT RIGHT NOW OF THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THAT ARE ARE. CONSISTENTLY IMPACTED BY THE DIESEL DISOWNS IN AND WE LOOK FOR A AN ABILITY TO GO TO ELECTRIFICATION ON FREIGHT. ON VEHICLES. UNLESSWE REDUCE THIS CONGESTION OUTSIDE OF OUR PORTS LET'S WE MAKE A CONCENTRATED EFFORT. HAVE THINGS IT CAN BE THE BEST TECHNOLOGY BUT SITTING NOT MAKING ANY KIND OF. MONEY OR TURNS OR. IS JUST SITTING IS CONGESTION IN YOU'D MENTION ABOUT TO FROM MODES OF TRYING TO REDUCE. WE ALSO HAVE THE POSSIBILITY OF CONTRAFLOW AND GETTING CAPACITY OF IN DIRECTIONAL TRAFFIC. A BIT. I WANTED WE TALK ABOUT INFRASTRUCTURE NEED. WE TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW THE ABILITY TO REDUCE CONGESTION OUT OF OUR PORTS. TO BE ABLE TO TO INCENTIVIZE AN ECONOMY NUMBER ONE BECAUSE AGAIN IT'S A THIRD OF OUR ECONOMY. IN CALIFORNIA WE JUST MOVED UP TO THE. NUMBER FIVE IN THE WORLD. BUT I THINK WHAT WHEN YOU GUYS TALK ABOUT YOUR ABILITY TO. BE PART OF THIS PROCESS I THINK IT'S A TWO WAY STREET WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT WANTING TO BE PART IN THE FREIGHT INDUSTRY. AND. IN THE TIMES WORLD. WE HAVE TO BECAUSE THE INTEGRATION WITH. NANA THOMAS AND THOMAS WE'RE GONNA HAVE. THE CONUNDRUM IF WE DON'T CONTINUE TO WORK THROUGH THE REDUCTION OF CONGESTION AND IMPROVE THAT ECONOMY BECAUSE OUR FREIGHT IS GOING TO INCREASE DRAMATICALLY. IN THE NEXT THREE TO FIVE YEARS WE DON'T WANT TO GIVE THAT INDUSTRY ANY REASON TO GO ELSEWHERE. SO I THINK THAT. NOT ONLY IS THE STATE HAVE TO BE A PART OF IT THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCE BOARD HAS BEEN PART OF THE PRIVATE INDUSTRY ALSO HAS TO BE PART OF THAT. THREE LEGGED STOOL. CREATE AND SUPPORTER ECONOMY. NOT ONLY TO ADVANCE IN TECHNOLOGY BUT ALSO REDUCTION OF GHGS PARTICULATES. BUT IN THE ADVANCEMENT OF ECONOMY PEOPLE MAKING. A LIVING. AND SO I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING YOU AND YOUR INDUSTRY BEING PART OF THAT. THE PROCESS GOING FORWARD. I THINK IT HAS COMMENTS AND I VERY MUCH AGREE I THINK THE A THREE LEGGED STOOL APPROACHES CRITICAL. WE WOULD BE EAGER TO CONTINUE IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND THEN LOOKING AT BACK TO INFRASTRUCTURE GHG. AYE IF WE THINK ABOUT SORT OF WHAT THE AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE I WILL MEAN FOR THE TRUCKING INDUSTRY IT WILL ALLOW LONG HAUL TRUCKING. WITH AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES BUT THEN. THAT WILL. WHAT WE'RE CALLING CREATE A LOT OF TRANSFER HUBS WHICH WILL BE A LOT OF SHORT STOPS AND THAT WILL BE DRIVEN BY HUMAN DRIVERS BUT ONE ADVANTAGE OF THAT? IS THAT FOR SHORTER HAUL TRUCKING THERE'S ABILITY TO RELY MORE ON THE ELECTRIC DRIVE TRAIN RATHER THAN. INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE FOR SHORTER DISTANCES I THINK I CAN HELP WITH SOME OF THE GHC AND THAT IS ALSO BEEN LINKED BACK TO THE IMPORTANCE OF BUILDING THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF THESE TRANSFER HUBS JUST OUT OF SIGHT. MAJOR CITIES THAT WAS WOULD HELP WITH THIS FLOW. APPRECIATE IT SO I THINK THE OUTCOME REALLY IS THE LOOKING HOW THE ELECTRIFICATION GOING TOWARDS. AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES ARE HYBRIDS OR WHATEVER THE THE COMPONENT IS THAT WE AS A LEGISLATURE. NEED TO BE CONSCIOUS OF THE THE IMPACT OF NOT BEING A PART OF THE. THE BIG PICTURE OF MAKING SURE THAT THE PLUGINS ARE READILY ACCESSIBLE TO TOOK AT AND. FOR THE MOBILITY OF THIS THIS TECHNOLOGY YOU LOOK AT DIFFERENT CASE SCENARIOS WHERE. WHEN YOU DO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE THE PICK UP AND PICK UP AREAS. THE FAST CHARGING THAT WOULD BE IMPERATIVE. HARD TO HAVE THAT THERE SO. YOU KNOW YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO. WITH YOUR POLITICAL WILL IN YOUR AND YOUR EXPERTISE. WHERE WE HAVE THE LEGISLATURE? CAN INTRODUCE ON WORK WITH OUR AGENCIES IT AND MAKE IT A PRIORITY. ANOTHER WAS AB EIGHT WAS CLOSE TO ACCOMPLISH THIS. BUT IT HAS BEEN SO I WOULD SAY. A LEARNING PROCESS. OKAY I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO HAVE PRIVATE INDUSTRY DRIVE THIS NO PUN INTENDED BUS. AND GET THIS THING GOING AND GET GRAY BUREAUCRACY OUT OF THE WAY. AND LET THE PRIVATE IS THREE TAKE IT OVER GET IT DONE SO THAT WE CAN PROMOTE AND GO OUT AND DO THIS GOOD STUFF. THAT WE WANT TO DO FOR THE ENVIRONMENT INFO. AND AND SAVE SAVING LIVES. SO I CAN THINK US ENOUGH AND AGAIN. WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE OR COMMITTEE CONSULTANTS HOW WE CAN BETTER LEGISLATE. TO ADVOCATE. ON THE OTHER PROCESS THAT NEWS IS SO. THAT'D THROUGH THE PROPONENTS AND OPPONENTS. I THINK USES SOCIAL WE WERE FOR ON THIS I CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH FOR BEING HERE TODAY. THANK YOU. SO WITH THAT WE'RE GONNA ENTERTAIN PUBLIC COMMENTS SO ANY BUT MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THAT WOULD LIKE TO COME FORWARD TO THE MIKE. PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME. WHO YOU REPRESENTING OF GIVE YOU A COUPLE THREE MINUTES TO US? STATE YOUR CASE. WHILE ALL THIS. MISTER CHAIR. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE PILOT CHEAT ON BEHALF OF TESLA. IN LIEU THE LATE HOUR.

WELL THOUGHT OUT A DISCUSSION. IT'S CLEAR THAT A MASSIVE DISRUPTION TO THE WAY PEOPLE GET AROUND IS COMING. AUTOMATED DRIVING IF DONE CORRECTLY WILL VASTLY IMPROVE PUBLIC SAFETY. AND SAVE LIVES. HOWEVER SAFETY. NOT PROFIT SHOULD BE THE FOCUS. THESE VEHICLES SHOULD NOT JUST DISPLACE HUMAN DRIVERS THEY MUST OPERATE BETTER THAN THEM. AND WITH THAT I WILL. ADJOURN THIS. SUBCOMMITTEE.
