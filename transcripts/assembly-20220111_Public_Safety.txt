DO YOU HAVE ANYONE ONLINE OR ON THE PHONE. YES TO CHAIR WILL YOU MAY BURKE THIS IS FOR IN SUPPORT OF A AB TWO TWO EIGHT RODRIGUEZ THEY WE WERE NOT READY FOR TESTING. THURMOND WHO WOULD NAME ORGANIZATION AND THEIR STANCE. BLAZON GERMAN IF YOU WISH TO SPUR US SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL IS PRESS ONE THEN ZERO. DO CHAIR NO ONE IS SIGNALED THAT THEY WISH TO SPEAK OKAY IS THERE ANYONE IN THE IN THE BUILDING IN THE AUDIENCE THAT WOULD LIKE TO. SPEAK IN SUPPORT.

SEEING NONE IN THE ROOM- WILL AGAIN DO THE SAME WITH THE OPPOSITION GIVEN THEM MISTER EIGHTY EIGHTY AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK. IN OPPOSITION OF AB TWO TWO EIGHT RODRIGUEZ. NO ONE WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO. MISTER CHAIR KNOWN AS SIGNALED THAT THEY WISH TO SPEAK THERE'S NO ONE ON THE LINE. BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE AND I BELIEVE MR LACKEY HAS A STATEMENT OR QUESTION YEAH ORANGE MORE QUESTION IS ARE. A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ANYWHERE AVAILABLE MAYBE IN THE ROOM I JUST I SEE THERE'S NO ONE ONLINE. THAT'S UNFORTUNATE. OKAY THE REASON WHY I ASK THAT IS OUR OUR STAFF AND MYSELF HAVE QUESTIONS ON HOW THIS WOULD IMPACT THE OPERATIONS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE BUT APPARENTLY WE CAN'T GET AN ANSWER TO THAT BUT THAT'S IMPORTANT- I'M- I'M CERTAIN. AND BECAUSE I KNOW- BURKE WILL WEEK CERVETERI JOURNAL OF BONTA DEAD IF THE DEPARTMENT HAD ANY PROBLEM FOR QUANTITY WOULD HAVE NOTIFIED THIS COMMITTEE BUT NOTIFIED THE AUTHOR. AND SOME OF US HAVE A PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP WITH YOU TO AND YOU KNOW SO I'M PRETTY SURE WE HAVE GOTTEN SOME HIT. BUT WHAT IF THERE WAS A PROBLEM SO I WOULD WE'VE BEEN ASKING THIS QUESTION FROM THE VERY BEGINNING WE- WHAT. WHAT'S THE CURRENT PROBLEM WHERE. IS WHAT WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT. WHAT THEY'RE DOING NOW IF ANYTHING ALL YOU JUST WANT TO KNOW. PROCESS YES BY. HELLO MISTER CLARK. I'M WILLING TO BET THAT. I'M GOING TO BE VOTING FOR YOUR BAIL- I'M WILLING TO BET THEY DON'T HAVE THE CAPABILITY AT THIS TIME TO DO IT BECAUSE YOU'RE SO FAR BEHIND. WHAT OTHER ISSUES SUCH AS GETTING PEOPLE WHO HAVE GUNS THAT ARE ILLEGAL. AND GETTING TO THEM AND PRESENT AND- PUTTING THOSE GUNS IN THEIR POSSESSION. SO IF I WERE YOU MR AUTHOR- I WOULD WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT- TO SEE HOW YOU VIEW YOUR BILL CAN BE MODIFIED OR PERHAPS THERE'S A BUDGET ASK YOU-COULD HAVE. THOUGHT BECAUSE THIS IS JYJ THERE ARE MORE GUN STORES THAN MCDONALD'S- SO THIS IS A HUGE COMMITMENT OF TIME AND MONEY. AND OF- I THINK YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF WORK AHEAD OF US WE'RE ONLY GOING TO VOTE ON THE POLICY TODAY. BUT THE IMPACT ON THAT DEPARTMENT WILL BE GREAT. NOT A GOOD POINT I WOULD ALSO JUST LET YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO MEMBERS OF SUPP FIVE CITY LAUNCHED COMMITTEE. THAT COULD BE EXTREMELY HELPFUL AND- MAKING SURE THAT THIS IS BUDGETED APPROPRIATELY WE HAVEN'T HAD OUR FIRST MEETING YET BUT- YOU COULD START LOBBYIST RIGHT NOW AND THEN. AND HOPEFULLY YOU GET TO VOTED IN TICKET TO REQUIRE THREE SO- I BELIEVE THAT'S IMPORTANT IS A POLICY COMMITTEE- BUT- AS MR LACKEY MR CORKER'S POINTED OUT WHAT WE NEED TO BE VERY SENSITIVE TO RESOURCES MONEY AND THE ABILITY TO GET THE START. APPLICATION BASICALLY. WHAT THANK VERY MUCH I OBVIOUSLY THIS IS THE FIRST HEARING OF THIS BILL AND I'M SURE WITHIN TIME THINGS WILL PROBABLY BE MODIFIED TO CHANGE IT TO MAKE IT MORE FEASIBLE. AND WORK WITH A PARTNER JUSTICE TO SEE HOW WE CAN GET OTHER SUPPORT. AND REALLY JUST ADDRESSED THIS ISSUE RIGHT HOW WE GET THOSE FOLKS LICENSE AT LEAST. EVERY THREE YEARS OF NOT WE CAN WORK ON SOMETHING ELSE BUT THE FACT THAT THERE IS NOTHING IN STATUTE THAT SAYS. THEY ARE TO BE EXPECTED IS A PROBLEM SO WE NEED TO SEE HOW WE COULD NOT CORRECT THAT ISSUE MOVING FORWARD. OKAY SO WITHOUT RESPECT US ROAD THANK YOU SHARES RECOMMENDED NINE I DID DECIDE TO WE NEED TO DO- NOT CERTAIN JUST BECAUSE EVERY. WEEK I DON'T THINK WE HAVE THE LUXURY OF. THE EXCUSE THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY. AS THE- HAS POINTED OUT YESTERDAY. SO WITH THAT CALL THE ROLL. AB T. TWO EIGHT THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER HI JONES SAWYER HI LACKEY LACKEY HI BONTA. BONTA HI BRIAN BRIAN I WORK I WORK HI SANTIAGO.
