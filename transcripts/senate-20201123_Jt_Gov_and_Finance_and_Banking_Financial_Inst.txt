AS WELL BEEN HONORED TO WORK WITH YOU AND THE COMMITTEE- YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN ACCESSIBLE. AND WE WE'VE HAD FUN TOGETHER SO THANK YOU SO MUCH I'VE BEEN ON THIS COMMITTEE FOR SIX YEARS AND- IT'S BEEN ONE OF MY FAVORITE SO THANK YOU- MISTER CHAIR WHEN I WAS YOUNG. AB AND MARRIED TO A BEFORE KIDS WE NVESTED IN A NEW BANK. AND IT WAS A PRETTY CONSERVING INVESTMENT OUT OF THE SMALL LITTLE PORTFOLIO WE WERE BUILDING AT THE TIME- BUT IT WAS A FINE VENTURE- ONLY TO WATCH AFTER A COUPLE YEARS THAT- YOU KNOW A COUPLE OF THE LOANS THAT THEY MADE ACTUALLY FAILED AND THEY WERE SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH. THAT THE BANK AT THE CLOSE AND WE HAD GOOD OLD FDIC AND ALL KINDS OF FUN STUFF WAY BACK IN. THAT TIME IN HISTORY WHERE BANKS FOR FAILING. SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT A PUBLIC BANK- I CERTAINLY HAVE. A PERSONAL SCARS- OF A OF AN INVESTMENT IN IN IN SUCH AN ENDEAVOR KNOWING THAT THEY ARE NOT. MASSIVE PROFIT MAKING VENTURES AND COULD HAVE A LOT OF DOWNSIDE. AS YOU MENTIONED I WAS THE TREASURER TAX COLLECTOR FOR THE COUNTY OF ORANGE. AND ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS I DID WAS TRY TO FORM A BANK BECAUSE- AT THE BANKS IN THE AREA THE LARGE BANKS DID NOT WANT WELFARE RECIPIENTS- IN THEIR LOBBIES. THEY JUST WANT TO CASH THE CHEQUES. THEY DIDN'T WNT THE DIRTY DIAPERS AND ALL THAT THAT ALL THE THINGS IGOT TO HEAR ABOUT WHY THEY SHOULD NOT. BE DOING OUR- A CHECK CASHING SO YOU HAVE FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE SHOW UP ON A MONDAY- WE HAD ONE BRANCH THAT WAS IN THE STORE A GROCERY STORE AND IF IT BLOCK CUSTOMERS FROM GOING INTO THE STORE SO THEY SET UP A VAN IN THE PARKING LOT. CASH WELFARE CHECKS AND CHARGE THE COUNTY OF ORANGE A PRETTY STEEP SOME. FOR THAT PRIVILEGE EVEN THOUGH IT WAS. NOT OUR FAULT THAT THE BRANCH WAS INSIDE A GROCERY STORE. SO WE HAD FUN WITH THE STATE BANKING INSTITUTION THE FDIC- WE WORK PUT TOGETHER A BUSINESS PLAN WORK WITH OUR LOCAL- BANKS- AND WE FORMED A ROOF WE WERE IT WAS SO CLOSE TO ACTUALLY DOING SOMETHING JUST BECAUSE WE WANTED TO HELP THOSE WHEN. THEY WERE DEALING WITH THE SOCIAL SERVICES AGENCY. BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY MISTER CHAIR. OF WE WERE GOING TO SAVE ABOUT A MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR IN FEES AND COSTS BY CONVERTING AND I AND SETTING UP OWN BANK BUT- WE FOUND OUT THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT REIMBURSES 80% OF. COSTS FOR SOCIAL SERVICES SO WE'RE ONLY GOING TO MAKE A PROFIT OF TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND. DOLLARS A YEAR AND THAT WOULD BE AFTER ALL THE AUDITS ALL THE STAFF AND ALL THE WORK. AND SO IT JUST DIDN'T SEEM TO PENCIL OUT. SATISFACTORILY AND SO I'M I'M I WANT TO KEEP AN OPEN MIND- ON TODAY'S DISCUSSION BUT I HAVE A REAL. CONCERN WHEN THE PUBLIC SECTOR. GETS INTO THE BUSINESS THAT IS. NORMALLY CONDUCTED BY THE PRIVATE SECTOR. AND I GET NERVOUS WHEN THERE'S A CHANCE THAT THERE COULD BE LOSSES IN THERE FOR THE TAXPAYERS WOULD HAVE TO SUBSIDIZE YOUR BAILOUT OR- WHATEVER CAN HAPPEN SO. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THE DISCUSSION BUT I I'VE SORT OF HAD PERSONAL EXPERIENCES. THAT HAVE. YOU KNOW MADE AN IMPRESSION ON ON ON MY THINKING.

AND WE WERE GOING TO BE- OPEN TO WORK WITH HER AND- TREASURE MARK TO ENSURE THAT WE DO A STATE PUBLIC BANK OTHERS RESPONSIBLE AND DOES THE PUBLIC BENEFITS INCLUDE THAT WE INTENDED TO DO.

CLOSE LOOK GOVERNMENTS TO FACE. OFF BLOWN FINANCIAL CRISIS IS AND WE HAVEN'T SEEN. OUR BIG BANKS STEP UP TO THE PUBLIC GOOD BUT THEY HAVE STEPPED UP. A TO LEARN. TO ENSURE THE PROFIT. OUR ARE STILL BEING MADE AND I THINK THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH THAT I THINK WE NEED TO CHANGE THAT WE DO OF THE BANKING SYSTEM SO THAT. WE HAVE A STATE PUBLIC BANK THAT TAKES A LOOK AT THE PUBLIC GOOD. WILL THEY BE PROFIT DRIVEN THE- COULD MAKE A PROFIT YES. UP BUT AT THE CORE GROUP THAT HAS TO BE A PUBLIC INTEREST AND WE'VE SEEN THIS- AND I DON'T THINK WE CAN TURN A BLIND GUY- ON ON ON THE NEAT. TO HAVE A TO REENTER. A FINANCIAL SYSTEM THE PUTS THE PUBLIC GOOD. BEFORE AND WE NEED BROKE. AND I THINK RESPOND SEE THAT AND RE IMAGINATION OF WHAT ECONOMIC SYSTEM COULD LOOK LIKE. ACROSS THE COUNTRY. IS IT A IS IT A BIG CHALLENGE TO DO THIS YES IS IT WORTH DOING ABSOLUTELY. A 100% WE HAVE TO DO THIS AND SOME MIGHT SAY WELL WHY SHOULD WE HAVE A PUBLIC BANK AND I'M GOING TO BORROW THE WORDS MY COLLEAGUE MR CHU BUT THESE ARE THE EXACT SAME ARGUMENTS. THAT WERE USED. ONE ONE NINE WHEN INDUSTRIES TRIED TO PREVENT A PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM. AND THESE ARE THE SAME ARGUMENTS THAT WERE USED. A ONE WE NEED TO GET A PUBLIC HEALTH CARE SYSTEM- AND IT'S THE SAME ARGUMENTS THAT WE USED. ONE PRESENT OBAMA TRIED TO. TRIED. YOUR REFORM OUR HEALTH CARE. AND IT'S THE SAME ARGUMENT WERE GONNA YOU YOU THAT THAT ARE. YOU TO SUPPRESS. ABOUT FOR. AND SO WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK TRANSFORMING AND WE- THE WAY WE BANKING. I THINK IT'S IMPAIR. THAT WE START HEARING HELLO. SO THE OF THE NAY THAT THANKS. BOB COULD DO IT. GOOD AND WE SEEN THAT ARE WITH YOU WILL PAVE THE- TO AND OUR CAN- INSPECTOR- WITH LOCAL. BANKS THAT HAVE DONE GREAT GOOD TEMP WORKING. AND OUR- INTEREST BEFORE. BEFORE THE PROP AND WE LOOK. TO PARTNERING WITH. A CREDIT UNION AND JIMMY BANKS ARE TO CONTINUE THEIR HARD WORK. SOME OF THIS ARE. WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE BANK IN ORDER TO- AND YOU AT IT PUBLIC GOOD PARTNERS. WITH SOME BANKS A COMMUNITY AND YOU AT IS.

UP FOR FOOD- WOULDN'T BE NICE TO HAVE A BIG SYSTEM THAT SAYS. HEY THAT THAT IS THAT IS IN. AND WE SHOULD THE BEST. IN THOSE AREAS LUCKLESS THOSE CAN AND AT THE WE SEE. EVEN IN THERE A AND IN THE- NORTH WITH PUBLIC BANG ARTICLE THAT THAT WE SAW LESS OF AN- RATE. BECAUSE THEY WAS ABLE TO LEVERAGE. SOME OF THE RELAY. WITH ITS LOGO BANKS.

WHEN ASSEMBLY VIRTUE HAVE BEEN CANDIDLY WONDERFUL TO WORK WITH- TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE ROBUST DISCUSSION- THEY ARE WILLING TO BE ABLE TO COMPROMISE AND THEY'RE COMMITTED TO THIS ISSUE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER THANK YOU NOW WE'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO. TURN THE FLOOR OVER TO SOME NUMBER CHU GOOD MORNING MR CHU THE FLOOR IS YOURS THEN WILL GO. TO THIS POWER MISTER HERBERT AT WE AGAIN WILL NEED TO BE ABLE TO ADJOURN THIS. SPECIFIC PANEL AT NINE FIFTY SIX DUE O THE TIGHT TIME LINE THAT WE HAVE WITH HEALTH% COMMITTEE IN THE CUPBOARD PROTOCOLS WILL TURN IT OVER TO US AND NUMBER TWO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR GOOD MORNING SENATORS AND LET ME START WITH THE RECORD MISTER SANTIAGO AND I CLEARLY DID NOT SHARE MEMOS ABOUT OUR COMMON SARTORIAL A TIRED THIS MORNING. BUT WE HAVE A STRONG SHARED PERSPECTIVE ON THE FUTURE OF THE STATE'S WELL WHEN IT COMES TO BANK. I AS MR SANTIAGO ALLUDED TO LAST YEAR OUR LEGISLATURE PASSED AND OUR GOVERNOR SIGNED AB EIGHT FIFTY SEVEN. TO ALLOW LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO APPLY FOR LOCAL PUBLIC BANKING CHARTERS WHICH DID MAKE CALIFORNIA THE FIRST STATE IN A HUNDRED YEARS. TO ALLOW THE AUTHORIZATION OF PUBLIC BANKS. IT WAS A MONUMENTAL FIRST STEP AND I ALSO IN ADDITION TO BANKING AMAZING ADVOCATES AND A PUBLIC BANKING COALITION. AS WELL AS SENATORS WHO ARE ON THIS CALL WHO WERE EARLY SUPPORTERS OF THAT MEASURE. I REALLY DO WANT TO THANK THE DEEP PARTNERSHIP AND WORK THAT WE DID WITH THE CHAIRS OF THE RELEVANT SENATE COMMITTEES- CENTER MCGUIRE CENTER BRADFORD CENTER PORTANTINO AND CERTAINLY MANY OTHERS. THIS LAST YEAR'S CONVERSATION WAS ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF LOCAL PUBLIC BANKS. TODAY'S CONVERSATION IS ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF THE VISION OF A STATE. A STATE OTHER BANK THAT KEEP THE PEOPLE BY NASH POWER. IN OUR STATE TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE JUMP STARTING OUR STATE'S ECONOMIC RECOVERY. TO CATALYZE THE DEVELOPMENT OF. LOCAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN OUR COMMUNITIES PROVIDING INFRASTRUCTURE CAPITAL AND SUPPORT. WE DON'T KNOW THAT'S FAR RECOVERY EFFORTS HAVE BEEN DRIVEN BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT CHOSE TO USE AS INTERMEDIARIES. THE WORLD'S LARGEST COMMERCIAL BANKS. THESE RECOVERY EFFORTS THAT HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY INADEQUATE. I WOULD SUGGEST THAT WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ESTABLISH THIS YEAR SOMETHING THAT BILLS ARE WORKING HISTORY OUR EXISTING AYE BANK. AYE AND I WOULD SUGGEST THAT WITHOUT A STATE PUBLIC BANK OU STATE WILL CONTINUE TO BE DEPENDENT ON OUTSIDE FOR PROFIT ACTORS. AND WILL BE CHALLENGING INSURING THE LONG TERM. AND ACCOUNTABLE AND SUSTAINABLE RECOVERY. THE VISION OF PUBLIC BANKING IS TO PROVIDE INVESTMENT IN FINANCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE TO PROMOTE THE PUBLIC GOOD. PUBLIC GOODS- THAT INVOLVED DEVELOPING STANDARDS TO PREVENT DISCRIMINATION IN OUR FINANCIAL SERVICES MARKET. ENSURING THAT WORKERS AND BUSINESSES BENEFIT FROM THE VALUE OF THEIR WORK. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE STATE PUBLIC BANK I WOULD GO BEYOND ECONOMIC RECOVERY THIS IS AN INVESTMENT TO CREATE A LEGACY OF LONG TERM FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY FOR OUR STATE. CREATION OF A BANK WOULD BE THE FIRST STEP TO CREATE A SHARED INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE DEGREE BETWEEN LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AND OUR STUDENTS. AS MR SANTIAGO ROUTED TO THE BANK OF NORTH DAKOTA HAS BEEN A CLEAR EXAMPLE IN THIS AREA. THEIR BANK HAS CONSISTENTLY DELIVERED DOUBLE DIGIT RETURNS IN EQUITY TO THEIR STATE EVEN DURING THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT FINANCIAL CRISIS. THIS YEAR THE BANK OF NORTH DAKOTA FACILITATED NORTH DAKOTA HAVING THE LARGEST P. P. P. LOAN FUNDING FOR WORKFORCE IN THE COUNTRY. HELPING TO GET THOSE LOANS TO THE BUSINESSES THAT NEED THEM THE MOST THROUGH COMMUNITY LENDERS. WE ALSO KNOW THAT STATE PUBLIC BANKS WOULD BRING REVENUES AND PROFITS TO RURAL AND URBAN COMMUNITIES LIKE THAT REPRESENT BIBLE BANKING MARKETS THAT ARE OFTEN IGNORED BY WALL STREET. NOW I KNOW WE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME THIS PAST YEAR TO GET THE DETAILS RIGHT AND THAT I WOULD SUGGEST IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT WE COULD BE ENGAGING RIGHT. I REALLY APPRECIATE. THE FACT THAT I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF SHARED VISION ON HOW WE DO THIS BUT AS WE KNOW THE DEVIL'S IN THE DETAIL AND THAT'S ENGAGEMENT THEY WERE HOPING TO HAVE TODAY. CHAIRMAN REQUIRE TALKED ABOUT THE CHALLENGE OF DOING THIS DURING THIS PANDEMIC IN RECESSION WHICH I GREATLY APPRECIATE. WHAT I SUGGEST THOUGH IS THAT WE ALSO FOCUS ON THE CHALLENGES OF NOT MOVING ON THIS DURING THIS TIME. AS WE ARE HOPING AND PRAYING FOR A SPEEDY AND FAIR RECOVERY. I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT OUR COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN CRYING OUT FOR HELP. FROM THE LARGEST BANKS IN AMERICA AND UNFORTUNATELY THAT HELP HAS NOT YET COME. ONE FINAL OBSERVATION ON OUR WEB VICE CHAIR MORLOCK APPRECIATE YOUR PARTICIPATION WAS HEARING THAT. AND I KNOW WE ALWAYS HAD HEALTHY DEBATES ON THESE ISSUES AND ALWAYS HELP. TO ENSURE THAT WHATEVER WE DO- WE ARE MOVING FORWARD THE BEST POLICIES AND HE REFERRED TO THE PRIVATE BANK THAT. I WOULD NOTE THAT THE BILL THAT WE MOVED LAST YEAR PUT IN SO MANY REQUIREMENTS FOR LOCAL PUBLIC BANKING FROM OUR FRIENDS NOW SEES PUBLIC SCRUTINY. THE APPROVAL REQUIRES FOR ANY PRIVATE SECTOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS INCLUDING FDIC DEPOSIT INSURANCE COLLATERAL REQUIREMENTS EXAGGERATE. THAT IT'S POSSIBLE THAT IT WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO MEET THESE REQUIREMENTS. AND I DO APPRECIATE THE PERSPECTIVE THAT THERE ARE PLENTY OF THINGS THAT THE PRIVATE SECTOR CAN DO BETTER THAN THE PUBLIC SECTOR. BUT IN THIS FIELD OF BANKING THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE SERVING THE PUBLIC. YOU LOOK AT THE MORTGAGE FORECLOSURE CRISIS THE STUDENT LENDING CRISIS THE PREDATORY CONSUMER LOAN CRISIS THE FAILURE OF BANKING SERVICES FOR MILLIONS OF SMALL BUSINESSES DURING THIS RECESSION. THE LACK OF INVESTMENT IN INFRASTRUCTURE. AND THE FACT THAT WE HAVE THE LARGEST BANKS IN THE WORLD IN OUR COUNTRY SERVING CALIFORNIA ALLEGEDLY THAT HAVE BEEN MAKING UP. FAKE BANK ACCOUNTS THAT HAVE BEEN INVESTING IN THE GUN INDUSTRY THE FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRY BAD LABOR PRACTICES THAT ARE DENYING OUR CONSTITUENTS AT THIS MOMENT- UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS FROM ET. WE NEED TO LOOK AT REAL ALTERNATIVES SO WITH THAT AGAIN I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE FOR THE ENGAGEMENT IN THIS CONVERSATION NOW MORE THAN EVER IS THE TIME TO HAVE THIS DISCUSSION. ON HOW WE BUILD A CHIU EQUITABLE. ACCOUNTING THANK YOU MISTER. SEPTEMBER THANK YOU MUCH IN A WE ARE APPRECIATIVE OF YOUR PARTNERSHIP SIR THANK YOU- TODAY HE AND ONGOING. THAT YOU'VE BEEN WONDERFUL TO WORK WITH AND IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU SIR THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR PARTICIPATING. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF COMMITTEES WE NOW WOULD LIKE TO BE A TO MOVE ON TO HEAR FROM MR POWER HE'S FROM THE OPEN SOCIETY FOUNDATIONS THAT BUT HE'S A PUBLIC.

MAJORITY THAT WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY AT TEN TWELVE MINUTES LEFT IN THIS PANEL THAT SENATE OVER HIS POWER AND WE WANT TO SAY THANK YOU SIR FOR PARTICIPATING THE FLOOR IS YOURS AND GOOD MORNING. SHARES THANK YOU TO EVERYONE PRESENT HERE TODAY INCLUDING THE CENTERS IN THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS- AND BACKGROUND. YEAH AND THE LEADERSHIP IN GOVERNMENT FELLOW WITH.

REALLY COMMEND ALL OF YOU FOR HAVING THE CONVERSATION ABOUT. BUILDING THE FINANCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO ADVANCE THE PUBLIC GOOD- AND TO FILL IN THE GAPS THAT ARE REALLY CREATED BY. EX EXTREMELY THAT'S WHAT THIS AT THIS PROPOSAL REALLY DOES- WHEN I SERVED IN THE CITY COUNCIL I SAW THE LIMITS OF LEGISLATION IN THE LIMITS OF MARKET BASED TOOLS TO SOLVE PROBLEMS I GOT A CHANCE TO LEAD EFFORTS TO RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE AND GUARANTEED PAID SICK LEAVE. WORK WITH TOOLS SUCH AS LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS AND ENTERPRISE ZONES IN TAX INCREMENT FINANCING YOU KNOW THESE TOOLS THAT WERE CREATED TO REALLY RESPOND TO THE IMPACTS OF THE EXTERNALITIES CREATED BY PRIVATE BANKS WHAT I FOUND IS NEITHER OF THESE TOOLS NECESSARILY BOTH LEGISLATION AND A MARKET BASED TOOLS NECESSARILY HELP. ALL OF YOU MEET THE MOMENT IN THAT WAY SORT OF ADDRESS. THE PROBLEMS OF THE SCALE OF THE ISSUES- TRULY WHAT. BANKS RE HAVE THE POWER TO DO. IS THEY CREATE MONEY. 97% OF ALL THE MONEY THAT GETS CREATED IN THE U. S. ECONOMY IS CREATED BY BANKS. AND THAT IS A LICENSE THAT IS PROVIDED BY THE STATE. AND NORMALLY WE WOULD ASK SOMETHING IN EXCHANGE FOR THAT LICENSE A PUBLIC GARDEN YOU KNOW THERE IS. INVESTMENT ACT ANOTHER MARKET BASED TOOLS BUT AGAIN TO GIVE YOU PERSPECTVE. LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS ARE ONE FORM OF- TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING THEY CREATE ABOUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITS OF HOUSING NATIONALLY EVERY YEAR. AND THERE'S A NATIONAL SHORTAGE OF SEVEN MILLION UNITS RIGHT IT WOULD TAKE SEVENTY YEARS. TO USE THIS TOOL TO BUILD. AND WE NEED TO ASK. SO WHAT PUBLIC BANKS REALLY DEALING WITH THIS PROPOSAL THAT IS PERFORMED- SPONSORS IT IS A IS A MIDDLE GROUND IT'S IN BETWEEN UNFETTERED MARKETS. AND IT'S IN BETWEEN STATE CONTROL IT ALLOWS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE BILL THE FINANCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE. SYSTEM CAPACITY TO LED TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SO THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO ACCESS THAT THE MUNICIPAL LIQUIDITY FACILITY WHICH CHARGES PENALTY RATES TO PROVIDE DEPOSITS TO CDFI IS AND- COMMUNITY BANKS SO THAT THEY CAN LEND TO SMALL BUSINESSES. AND ALSO FLIPS THE NARRATIVE IN THE CONVERSATION RUN WHO ACTUALLY MAKES MONEY FROM LENDING TO GOVERNMENT AND FROM LENDING TO SMALL BUSINESS. WE CAN'T GO BACK TO THE PRE KALRA CONNIE. THAT KIND OF ME WASN'T WORKING FOR WORKING PEOPLE. BUT IN ORDER FOR US TO FINANCE THE TYPE OF. INFRASTRUCTURE THE KIND OF HOUSING THE KIND OF THINGS. C. TO REALLY TRANSFORMER COMMUNITIES WE REALLY NEED A FINANCING PARTNER THAT ALIGNS WITH ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AGENDA THAT IS A FOUR BUT STATE. AND SO- THINGS THAT I THINK WE SHOULD BE ALL THINKING ABOUT AS YOU HAVE IN THE BANK AN INFRASTRUCTURE BANK THAT HAS BEEN IN EXISTENCE FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS. WHAT YOU'RE ABLE TO DO HERE IS EXPAND ITS CAPACITY. AND EXPAND ITS ROLE AND EXPAND ITS MANDATE SO THAT STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WHO ARE. PRESSED FOR. YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF DEALING WITH A- STRUCTURAL DEFICIT AND DEFICITS COULD CONNECTED TO. DIMINISHING REVENUES THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO ACCESS THE DOLLARS AT A LOWER RATE OF FROM AN INFRASTRUCTURE BANK. GOING TO THE MARKETS AND PAYING A HIGHER INTEREST RATE SO THE QUESTION WE HAVE TO ANSWER IS DOES IT MAKE SENSE. A HIGHER INTEREST RATE SCOTT IN STATE LEVEL WAR SHOULD THE STATE PROVIDE THOSE DOLLARS AT A LOWER RATE STILL MAKE A RETURN STILL HAVE THE FULL FAITH AND CREDIT BACKING FOR THOSE LOANS AND MAKE SURE THAT OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS DON'T HAVE TO CUT SERVICES OR CUT STAFF CAN WE LEARN TO SEE THE ADVISING COMMUNITY BANKS TO LEND IN COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED. BY INSTITUTIONAL RACISM BY DISINVESTMENT BY OTHER ISSUES THAT WE'VE SEEN THEIR HISTORICAL IN NATURE. AND THEN ALSO DOES THIS- STATE BANK ALSO CREATE THE CAPACITY TO DRIVE TRANSFORMATION IN THE LONG TERM. THIS IS A REALLY FANTASTIC THE PROPOSAL- AND I JUST WANT TO AND CLOSE BY SAYING. THE LICENSE TO CREATE MONEY THAT IS WHAT THE PUBLIC PROVIDES PRIVATE SECTOR BANKS THERE IS NO REASON WHY THE PUBLIC SECTOR COULD ALSO OBTAIN A LICENSE TO CREATE MONEY TO FILL IN THE GAPS THAT ARE CREATED BY PRIVATE SECTOR BANKS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR COMMENTS IF YOUR TESTIMONY TODAY WERE HONORED THAT YOU'RE WITH US THANK YOU VERY VERY GRATEFUL LAYS IN GERMAN WE NOW WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO ROUND OUT OUR FINAL SPEAKER IN OUR FIRST PANEL THAT'S MARK HERBERT VICE PRESIDENT IN CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESS MAJORITY. HERBERT WE'RE GONNA PROVIDE AT FIVE MINUTES WILL GO A LITTLE OVER OUR TIME BUT FIVE MINUTES SIR THE FLOOR IS YOURS AND I'LL GIVE YOU A ONE MINUTE PROBLEM TO GET CLOSE TO THAT FIVE MINUTE MARK MISTER HERBERT. GOOD MORNING. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU AND MEMBERS OF THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE APPRECIATE THE A JOINT HEARING APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY JOIN YOU- I WILL I WILL TRY TO BE BRIEF BECAUSE I AND I IMAGINE THERE ARE QUESTIONS AS WELL AS- WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE- RESPECT EVERYONE'S TIME. MY NAME IS MARK HERBERT I AM VICE PRESIDENT CALIFORNIA FOR SMALL BUSINESS MAJORITY WE ARE NATIONAL SMALL BUSINESS EDUCATION AND ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION- AND WE JUST FUNDAMENTALLY BELIEVE THAT ENTREPRENEURS AND SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS ARE CENTRAL BUILDING BLOCKS. TO HEALTHY SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY AND ECONOMY. AS WE ALL KNOW HERE BECAUSE IT HAS AN ABSOLUTELY DEVASTATING FOR CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESSES. AND WE'VE SEEN CLOSURE RATES ESPECIALLY. IN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR SOME PARTS OF THIRTY TO FORTY PERCENT. AND WE KNOW THAT THAT'S SIMPLY NOT SUSTAINABLE AND IF WE'RE LOOKING TO ACTUALLY RECOVER AND BUILD AN INCLUSIVE ECONOMY AT COMING OUT OF THIS PANDEMIC- WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CAPITAL NEEDS OF THOSE SMALL BUSINESSES. ARE DRESSED AS WE KNOW THE FED STEPPED IN TO PUMP BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN THE SMALL BUSINESS COMMUNITY- BUT IT WOULD AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHIU REFERENCE IT WAS VASTLY UNEVEN. MEANT MOSTLY IT WAS MEDIUM TO LARGER BUSINESSES THEY GOT THE MAJORITY OF THOSE BECAUSE IT WAS BUILT ON TOP OF THE EXISTING STRUCTURE. OF HOW SMALL BUSINESSES ACCESS IS CAPITAL- AND IT'S- PRIMARILY THROUGH BANKING RELATIONSHIPS WITH MANY OF THE VERY SMALL BUSINESSES. SIMPLY DIDN'T HAVE AND WE KNOW FROM SOME OF OUR SURVEYS THAT EVEN NOW AS WE LOOK FORWARD IN THE COMING MONTHS. I ROUGHLY 40% OF ENTREPRENEURS OF COLOR I'M AREN'T QUITE SURE THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE IT. INTO TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND BEYOND- AND THAT THE KEY PIECE HERE IS THAT FUNDAMENTALLY HOW ARE CAPITAL MARKETS ARE BUILT FOR THE VERY SMALL BUSINESSES. IT DOESN'T WORK IT'S NOT BUILT FOR THAT. AND SO WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW DO WE BUILD BETTER MARKET PLACE THAT ACTUALLY MEETS THE NEEDS OF THE VERY SMALL BUSINESSES. AND THAT WE SEEK TO SERVE THAT ARE CRITICAL TO THE LIVELIHOOD AND TO A CRITICAL ATTITUDE THE VITALITY OF OUR NEIGHBORHOODS- AND FINALLY WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE. DE. RISKING CAPITAL IT CAN BE A EXPENSIVE A MAKE ONE. TO REAL SMALL BUT- AND YOU CAN BE REST AND WE NEED TO DELIVER. AND MAKE SURE THAT- THERE ARE SOME SORT OF BACKSTOPS INSULTS OR SUBSIDY AVAILABLE FOR THOSE. VERY SMALL BUSINESSES WE ARE YOU KNOW AS THAT COMMUNITY LENDERS. DO THIS DAY IN AND DAY OUT OFTENTIMES NONPROFIT LENDERS LIKE CDFI IS ARE RAISING MONEY TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT CAPITAL. IS GETTING TO THOSE VERY SMALL BUSINESSES SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE GIVING THE TOOLS FOR SEE IF I COMMUNITY BANK FRIENDS. THAT THEY CAN MAKE THESE LOANS TO THE VERY SMALL BUSINESSES AND OUR COMMUNITY I'M THRILLED TO SEE THAT SOME OF OUR GOOD FRIENDS FROM THE CDFI COMMUNITY. WILL BE SPEAKING A LITTLE LATER TODAY I THINK OF THEIR ROLE. IN MAKING SURE THAT THE VERY SMALL BUSINESSES HERE IN CALIFORNIA HAVE ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL THAT THEY NEED TO SURVIVE. I'M IS GONNA BE AT ESSENTIAL. WHERE WERE PLEASES. THAT THE STATE ALREADY STEPPED UP. TO PROVIDE A NUMBER OF- FINANCIAL INVESTMENTS THROUGH THE AYE BANK AYE WE APPRECIATE MR WILLING HIS TEAM AND ALL THE WORK THAT THEY'VE DONE- TO ATTACH. TO ADDRESS AND THE CHAO'S THE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS ARE FACING- BUT SOME ESTIMATES PUT THE SMALL BUSINESS CAPITAL NEEDS IN THE TENS. OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. NOT AND WHILE WE HAVE SEEN- TENS OF MILLIONS INVESTED AND WE HOPE TO LEVERAGE THAT'S HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS IN SMALL BUSINESS LENDING CAPITAL. AND THE SCALE IN THE NEED OF THE PROBLEMS JUST. THINKING IS SIGNIFICANT AS WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE THINKING ABOUT SCALABLE SOLUTIONS- WE APPRECIATE THE CREATIVITY THAT THE CALIFORNIA REBUILDING FUND. AND AS CREATED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH I THANK IN PHILANTHROPY AND PRIVATE INVESTORS. A NEW PROGRAM JUST CAME ONLINE ON FRIDAY. THAT WILL GET ADDITIONAL DOLLARS. TO SEE IF IS TO THESE COMMUNITY LENDERS TO GET. SMALL DOLLAR LOANS TO THE BUSINESS OWNERS ON THE FRONT LINES OF THIS PANDEMIC. ALLEN SO WE APPRECIATE THAT CREATIVITY WHY THINK ABOUT WAYS. THAT THAT COULD BE SCALED WE THINK THAT THE PROMISE OF A PUBLIC BANK HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO THINK ABOUT. HOW DO WE GET MORE TOOLS AND MORE RESOURCES AND MORE CAPITAL- TO THE SMALLEST BUSINESSES. AND BUT FUNDAMENTALLY WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT NOT JUST THIS MOMENT. AND MEETING THE SIGNIFICANT NEED TO SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS AND OUR STATE FACES. HOW DO WE BUILD A MORE EQUITABLE ECONOMY IN THE FUTURE. ONE MIN EVEN BEFORE BECAUSE OF IT. EVEN BEFORE COVER THE CHALLENGES THAT SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS FACE FOR SIGNIFICANT- AND- CODE SIMPLY EXACERBATED THAT. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE MORE TOOLS BETTER INFRASTRUCTURE TO REALLY MEET THE NEEDS OF THE SMALLEST BUSINESSES. HERE IN THE STATES SO. WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT. HAVE BEEN CREATED IN THE PILOTS AND BEEN CREATED WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT THIS CONVERSATION WHAT IT MEANS FOR CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESSES. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO THIS THIS TO. CONTINUE DISCUSSION.

THAT WE NEED TO SEE RECEIVE THESE DOLLARS AS I MENTIONED BEFORE THE- EXISTING SMALL BUSINESS LENDING MARKETPLACE. ISN'T REALLY FUNCTIONING WELL FOR THE SMALLEST BUSINESSES THAT WE CARE ABOUT. IS THE MORE THAT WE CAN SCALE THE INFRASTRUCTURE NECESSARY. FOR CDFI IS TO MAKE THOSE LOANS. TO WORK WITH THE LENDERS WHO ARE ALREADY DOING THAT WORK.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH GERMAN MCGUIRE MEMBERS- GOOD MORE AND THANK YOU FOR THE EVENT TO BEFORE YOU. ENTER BY PER AS CALPERS CONTROLLERS RELATED TO THE SUBJECT OF THE STATE BANK OF FIRST I'D LIKE TO START OUT BY JUST- ACKNOWLEDGING THE MEMBERS OF THE FIRST PANEL AND TO JUST SAY THAT I SHARE VERY MUCH THE CONCERNS THAT WE NEED TO. BUILD A MORE JUST AND EQUITABLE ECONOMY AND JOBS THIS IS ONE WHERE UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES PARTICULARLY OUR LOW INCOME BLACK AND LATINO COMMUNITIES HAVE ACCESS TO CAPITAL AND ARE BETTER SUPPORTED DURING AND AFTER CERTAINLY- EVENTS LIKE THIS PANDEMIC. YOU KNOW I'VE AWARE OF SEARCHES ARE STILL OFFICER THAT OUR ECONOMY IS NOT WORKING FOR EVERYONE- SPECIFICALLY FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR AND LOW WAGE WORKERS- WE CERTAINLY MUST DO MORE TO REMOVE THE CURRENT BARRIERS- THAT ARE BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES AND BUSINESSES FACE AND- ACCESSING. BUDGET CAPITAL AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT- HOWEVER OF THE STATE BANK IS SIMPLY NOT THE SMARTEST MOST DIRECT WAY TO SERVE PEOPLE WHO NEED IMMEDIATE SUPPORT- I. BUT IT'S A COMPLEX ENDEAVOR AND I AM GOING TO GO INTO SOMEBODY A TECHNICAL DETAILS IN A MOMENT. BUT CHAO ITS BOTTOM LINE UP FRONT WITH THE REST OF THE STATE CALIFORNIA'S ABILITY TO MEET OUR EXISTING AND FUTURE FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS. AND AS I WILL OPERATE- SHORTLY- WE DON'T NEED TO REINVENT THE WHEEL GIVEN THAT THERE IS ALREADY AN EXISTING NETWORK OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE. TO ACCOMPLISH THESE GOALS AND I'M VERY HAPPY TO SEE THAT THE AGENDA TODAY IS COMPREHENSIVE- I AM. DELIGHTED THAT WE ARE. MENTIONING CD ADVICE AND ALSO HAVE THE ABILITY TO HEAR FROM ABOUT THE STRUGGLES FROM THE L. I. BANKS LATER ON TODAY. YOU KNOW MY PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY AS SUCH IT'S JUST OFFICERS TO PROTECT THE STATE'S FISCAL HEALTH. AND MY OFFICE ANALYZES OF THE STATE'S CASH FLOW NEEDS ON A DAILY BASIS AND WE WORK WITH THE TREASURER'S OFFICE TO ENSURE THAT THERE ARE SUFFICIENT FUNDS AVAILABLE TO MAKEPAYMENTS. AS THEY ARE DUE. PURSUANT TO THE ANNUAL BUDGET ACT. BECAUSE THE PANDEMIC THAT WAS. JUST SOME OF OUR ECONOMIC SECTORS AND BUSINESSES IN OUR STATE- CAUSING SOARING UNEMPLOYMENT. VOLATILE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND UNCERTAIN TAX REVENUE- I AND MY TEAM ARE MORE COMMITTED THAN EVER TO MONITORING THE SITUATION. AND YOU CURRENTLY MANAGE OUR FINANCIAL POSITION OVER PARTICULARLY AS THE NEXT TWO TO THREE YEARS. IN ORDER TO ENSURE WE CAN PAY THE STATE'S BILLS. STYLISH CAPITALIZE AND MAINTAIN A STATE BANK. BY FORCING DEPOSITS OF THE STATE'S FULL MONEY INVESTMENT ACCOUNT THE PMI A- REMAINS A DANGEROUS GAME A PUTS CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS AT ENORMOUS RISK. THE PMI A SHOULD REMAIN INVESTED IN SECURE COLLATERAL SUCH AS US TREASURY DEBT AND SAFE INSTRUMENTS WITH SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY AND YIELD TO PROVIDE THE STATE AND THE THOUSANDS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS INVESTED IN THE PMI A- THE MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY TO WITHDRAW FUNDS AS STATED. REQUIRING THE TREASURE TO THE BEST BEYOND MADE FUNDS IN SHORT TERM DEBT ISSUED BY THE CALIFORNIA INFRASTRUCTURE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT BANK I BANKS. A WHICH WOULD SERVE AS COLLATERAL I WILL BE BACK BY THE STATE IS ACTUALLY VERY CIRCULAR PROPOSITION AS IT MEANS WE WOULD BE REPLACES THE CARE COLLATERAL SUCH AS US. TREASURY DEBT WHICH THE PM I AM CURRENTLY IN THE US WITH A NEW UNTESTED JUST ADDED EXTRA MEANT FOR WHICH THERE IS NO CURRENT MARKET AND NO WAY TO ENSURE ANTI LATE LIQUIDITY. MEANING THAT WE NEED. AT THIS MONEY WE COULDN'T GET IT IN TIME. MOREOVER THIS OKAY. TAXPAYERS WOULD BE AT RISK FOR THESE NEW UNTESTED INVESTMENTS. IN FACT IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS RAISED FROM A COMMITTEES BACKGROUND BRIEF. PUBLIC BANK ADVOCATES STATES THAT IF THE BANK RECEIVED A FEDERAL GUARANTEE FOR ITS ASSETS IT MAY BE ABLE TO ATTRACT INVESTMENT FROM THE SURPLUS MONEY INVESTMENT FUND ORTHE PMI. OF THIS IS A MUCH MORE PRUDENT COURSE OF ACTION ABOUT ESTABLISHING A NEW BANK BASED ON THE PREMISE THAT THE STATE WILL INVEST ITS FUNDS AND AN UNTESTED FINANCIAL- BANG DEMONSTRATE THAT IT OFFERS COMPETITIVE RATES A COMPARABLE SECURITY BEFORE DEPOSITING. STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT FUNDS. SH UP MY OFFICE AND I HAVE BEEN A TO A MAN THE STATE'S CASH FLOW FOR THE LAST SIX YEARS WITHOUT EXTERNAL BORROWING. AND WE ARE NOW CLOSELY MONITORING THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. ALTHOUGH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST RECENTLY REPORTED STATE REVENUES ARE TWENTY SIX BILLION DOLLARS HIGHER THAN ORIGINALLY FORECAST FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO FISCAL YEAR. WE CANNOT LOSE SIGHT OF THE SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL CHALLENGES AHEAD FOR THE STATE. THIS IS A ONE TIME SURPLUS OF BIDS FACT MULTI BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET SHORTFALLS THROUGH FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE. THAT WOULD LIKELY REQUIRE THE STATE TO SELL REVENUE ANTICIPATION NOTES. AT A PURCHASE TO PAY THE STATE'S BILLS. AND I WOULD JUST CAUTION YOU FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE FOLLOWING US A TIME- THE LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT RECESSION- WHICH PUTS THE STATE IN A PRECARIOUS FINANCIAL POSITION. RESULTING IN THE ISSUANCES OF SEVERAL INCHES SUFFICIENT NOTES OUT REVENUE JUST PATIENT LAWRENCE. I'LL USE A CREDIT RATING DOWNGRADE TO TROUBLE DAYS. DURING THAT PERIOD THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE COUNTED EVERY PENNY OF THE DAILY BASIS IN ORDER TO PAY OUR BILLS. USING THE PMI A FUNDS OTHERWISE INTENDED TO BE INVESTED IN SHORT TERM LIQUID INSTRUMENTS IN ORDER TO MAKE HIGHER. TO MAKES LONGER LONG AS A MISALIGNED OF PURPOSES AND COULD LEAD TO EVEN HIGHER BORROWING COSTS FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IF THE SIZE OF THE REVENUE INTEREST PATIENT OUT HAD TO BE INCREASED DUE TO ILLIQUID INVESTMENTS. AND I. JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY SOMETHING BECAUSE I KNOW WE'VE BEEN TALKING A LOT ABOUT THE BANK OF NORTH DAKOTA. AND JOBS FROM ONE LAST POINT ASIDE FROM SKILLS. ADDING TO THIS POINT- YEAH I THINK WHAT WE EACH OTHER. WITH THOSE OF THE FOUNDING PRINCIPLES UPON WHICH THE BANK OF NORTH DAKOTA I WAS ESTABLISH AD. WHICH STIPULATED THAT THE BANK OF NORTH DAKOTA ASSIST IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF LOCAL BANKS NOT OFFER A COMPETITIVE ALTERNATIVE. AND SO I'M LIKE WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED IN THE OF LEGISLATION BEFORE US OF THE BANK OF NORTH DAKOTA DOES NOT PROVIDE BANKING SERVICES TO INDIVIDUALS OR BUSINESSES- INSTEAD A LOCAL BANK MUST APPLY TO ACCESS ONE OF THEIR LENDING PROGRAMS ON BEHALF OF THE CUSTOMER. BECAUSE IT RECOGNIZES LOCAL BANKS UNDERSTAND THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE. BETTER THAN A STATE ENTITY BECAUSE- AND BEYOND THE- RED OF THE FOR FROM THE- AIDS AS A STATE BANK COULD BE SUBJECT TO CHALLENGE FOR VIOLATING VARIOUS PROVISIONS OF THE STATE CONSTITUTION. ALSO THAT PROVIDES THE PLEDGE OF CALIFORNIA'S FULL FACE AND CREDIT TO DEPOSITORS IN THE STATE BANK. ARGUABLY VIOLATES PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE SIXTEEN RELATED TO PUBLIC FINANCE RESTRICTIONS. WELL I DO WANT TO SAY UP AND TOOK BOTH OF MR CHIU AND- WELL AUTHORED THE SUCCESSFUL AB EIGHT FIFTY SEVEN AND- WE ARE REALLY ANXIOUS TO SEE HOW OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WILL BE PURSUING A ITS OWN- PUBLIC BANK AND ALSO TO- SANTIAGO. YOU KNOW I THINK OF ALL THE DISCUSSIONS THAT HAVE BEEN CITIZENS FILED I'LL CERTAINLY AB THREE TIMES HAS BEEN INTRODUCED IN ARE DELIBERATED UPON I REALLY-FOCUSED ON- JUST OUT HOW TO KEEP THE STATE OUT OF REST- SIR THAT'S BEEN YOU KNOW KIND OF MY FOCUS BUT THERE IS A BETTER ALTERNATIVE HERE- OF. THE BANKING SYSTEM THAT'S BEING PROPOSED AT. THIS BILL I WOULD ARGUE ALREADY EXISTS. OTHER THAN STARTED NEW. HIGH STATES ENTITY. ALSO CAL INSTEAD JOINED THE DOWN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE FINANCIAL COMMITMENTS SUPPORT AND ATTENTION DIRECTED AT THE EXISTING NETWORK OF. HE DEVELOPMENT FINANCIAL AND MINORITY DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS TO WHICH I WILL COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO SCDF EYES FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS HEARING- AND THE START INSTITUTIONS THAT ALREADY EXISTS THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE ARE AIMING CHAU SERVES. CDFI OUR PRIVATE SECTOR ORGANIZATIONS THAT ATTRACT CAPITAL FROM PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SOURCES WE HAVE OVER EIGHTY ONE CD ADVISIG CALIFORNIA EACH WITH DEEP REACH INTO UNDERSERVED MINORITY COMMUNITIES. HELPING TO DEVELOP THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS SUPPORT THEIR BUSINESSES AND DRIVE ECONOMIC GROWTH AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. THESE LOCALLY BASED ORGANIZATIONS ARE WELL SUITED TO MAKE THE BEST DECISIONS ABOUT HOW TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE. OFFERING MULTIPLE OTHER PUBLIC POSITIVE BENEFITS TO THESE COMMUNITIES THAT REACH FAR BEYOND THE FINANCIAL BOTTOM LINE. CITY OF US FOR ORIGINALLY ESTABLISHED TO SPECIFICALLY PROVIDE FINANCIAL SERVICES TO UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES THAT'S STATE OF TROUBLED BANKS FOR NOT ASSISTING IN ANY SUBSTANTIAL WAY. THE FEDERAL COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT BANKING AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ACT OF NINETEEN NINETY FOUR CREATED A CDFI FUND ADMINISTERED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY. AND THE PURPOSE OF THIS WAS TO PROMOTE ECONOMIC REVITALIZATION AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT BY INVESTING IN. AND ASSISTING CSI'S THROUGH EQUITY INVESTMENTS CAPITAL GRANTS LOANS AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SUPPORT ORGANIZATIONAL CAPACITY BUILDING. CDFI SUPPLY FROM LIMITS ON THROUGH A COMPETITIVE PROCESS THAT REQUIRES THE CDFI IN MOST CASES TO PROVIDE AT LEAST A ONE TO ONE BATCH OF NON FEDERAL FUNDS TO RECEIVE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. THE FUND ALSO REWARDS BANKS AND THRIFTS FROM MAKING INVESTMENTS THE CDFI IS A DISTRESSED COMMUNITIES THROUGH ITS BANKING ENTERPRISE AWARD PROGRAM. AT THE NEW MARKETS TAX CREDITS PROGRAM INITIATED IN TWO THOUSAND TO ENCOURAGES PRIVATE SECTOR INVESTMENT BY OFFERING TAX CREDITS FOR QUALIFIED COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENTS. CITY HAVE ALWAYS USED THE MONEY AWARDED THROUGH THE CDFI FUND PROGRAMS TO LEVERAGE PRIVATE SECTOR RESOURCES INTO DISTRESSED COMMUNITIES AND TO SUPPORT AN ARRAY OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES INCLUDING HOUSING FOR LOW INCOME PEOPLE. BUSINESSES OWNED BY WELCOME PEOPLE BASIC FINANCIAL SERVICES COMMERCIAL FACILITIES THAT PROMOTE JOB CREATION OR RETENTION AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. AND CDFI SUPPLY THE TOOLS INCLUDING PROVIDING FINANCIAL SERVICES LOANS AND INVESTMENTS. OFFERING TRAINING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SERVICES TO ENABLE ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED INDIVIDUALS TO BECOME SELF SUFFICIENT STAKEHOLDERS AND THEIR FUTURE. AND I WANT TO JUST ADDRESSED IN PART CENTER DRAWS US QUESTION WHICH I THINK WAS EXACTLY HOW THE QUESTION ON POINT AND THAT IS HOW DO WE ENSURE. THAT WHAT WE ARE ENDEAVORING TO UNDERTAKE REALLY REACHES OUT HAS THE IMPACT INTENDED FOR THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE ARE TARGETING- AND WHAT I WILL SAY IS IT SIGNIFIES CULTIVATES SPECIALIZED KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH THEY DO BUSINESS- THEY FORGE DEEPER RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEIR CUSTOMERS AND COMMUNITY LEADERS. THIS TRANSLATES INTO A WILLINGNESS AND COMMITMENT TO SPENDING TIME ON INDIVIDUALIZED SERVICE A SPECIALIZED PROGRAM SO OFTEN ARE TOO TIME CONSUMING OR COSTLY FOR MAINSTREAM. FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. RE BILL DOES. COMMITTEE AND MAKE A LOANS TO PAY WITH LOW OR CREDIT. REQUIRES MORE THAN SIMPLY PROVIDING ACCESS TO CONVENTIONAL LOANS. REQUIRES FLEXIBILITY CHAD DAPT LENDING GUIDELINES TO THE NEEDS OF BORROWERS. SHOULD STEP I'M CONVINCED AND CONVENTIONAL COLLATERAL FOR LOANS. AND TO PROVIDE EDUCATION TRAINING AND ASSISTANCE TO POTENTIAL BORROWERS. MAINSTREAM FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS INVEST OUR OWN CAPITAL DIRECTLY INTO CITY ADVISED RECEIVING COMMITTEE OF REINVESTMENT ACT CREDIT A POTENTIAL CASH AWARDS UNDER THE SEAT IF I FUNDS BANK AT A PRICE AWARD PROGRAM. CDFI WAS CREATED FUTURE MARKER FROM MAINSTREAM FINANCIAL INSTITUTION PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. THANK YOU DEBATE BUSINESSES AND PEOPLE HELPING THEM TO GROW AND PROSPER. ONCE OUR CUSTOMERS HAVE ACHIEVED SOME SUCCESS ESTABLISH A GOOD CREDIT HISTORY AND REACHED A SUBSTANTIAL SIZE. THEY CAN THEN PROCEED TO ACCESSING CAPITAL AND LARGER AMOUNTS OF CAPITAL AVAILABLE FROM MORE MAINSTREAM LENDING INSTITUTIONS. THE DEVICE ARE TRAILBLAZERS IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS AND BRING PEOPL INTO THE ECONOMIC MAINSTREAM AS CONTRIBUTORS TO THE ECONOMY. NOW THE NUMBER OF CD ADVISE CONTINUES TO INCREASE NATIONWIDE THERE ARE NOW OVER NINE HUNDRED FIFTY CITY ADVISED ARE CERTIFIED BY THE CDFI FUND. THE OPERATE IN EVERY STATE ND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA SERVING BOTH RURAL AND URBAN COMMUNITIES. AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT LOAN FUNDS OF LAND TO BUILD BUSINESSES AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND COMMUNITY FACILITIES. YEAH I KNOW WHAT ARE SOME OF THE PROPONENTS OF THE PUBLIC BANKING ARGUE THAT AMONG OTHER THINGS A PUBLIC BANK COULD SUPPORT CD ADVISE WITH FUNDING FROM THE POOL MONEY INVESTMENT ACCOUNT AND THE IDEX. I ADDED WHAT I WOULD SAY TO THAT IS WE DON'T NEED TO ESTABLISH A STATE ACTIVITIES THE STATED GOALS. OF THE LEGISLATURE COULD SIMPLY INCREASE FUNDING FOR THESE PROGRAMS DIRECTLY THROUGH A ONE TIME DEPOSIT FROM THIS YEAR'S INCREASE REVENUES IDENTIFIED BY THE L. A. L. ARE USED BOND PROCEEDS TO GENERATE ADDITIONAL WORKING CAPITAL. IN FACT I BANKS HAS ALREADY INITIATED THE NEW PUBLIC PRIVATE EFFORTS TO SUPPORT CDFI IS MAKING MORE LOANS TO SMALL BUSINESSES AND I KNOW THE STRUGGLE WILL BE COVERING ABOUT IN A MOMENT. ADD DOES SHOULD THIS PROGRAM- PROVE SUCCESSFUL IN MEETING ITS GOALS THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS THE OPTION. OF INCREASING FUNDING FOR THAT PROGRAM. WE SHOULD ALSO INTEREST AND NOW BANK TO AND THE NEXT THEIR FINAL SUPPORT FOR CDS. THAT ALREADY IT'S JUST YOUR IN CALIFORNIA- AND ARE HERE TO SERVE UNDER OUR UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES TO PROVIDE SPECIALIZED FINANCIAL SERVICES. TO INDIVIDUALS AND BUSINESSES WATCH ADDITIONAL ACCESS. TO CREDIT AND CAPITAL. THERE IS A NATIONAL EFFORT UNDERWAY I DO APOLOGIZE FOR THE NATION'S TOP BANKS COMMITTING A PERCENTAGE OF THEIR PROFITS TO SEE DEFIES AS WELL AS TECHNOLOGICAL AND MENTORING SUPPORT. AND I WOULD URGE ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES ON THE SUBCOMMITTEE TO FOCUS ON AND GET FAMILIAR WITH THE SEPARATE AND ENGAGE WITH THAT REALLY HAVE CALIFORNIA STEP IN. OUT OF THIS- CALIFORNIA'S NOT TRADITIONALLY BEEN A BIG PLAYER WITH RESPECT TO- NATIONAL EFFORTS LIKE THIS RELATED TO CITY APPLIES AND I THINK IT'S A THIS IS AN EFFORT THAT IS ALL WELL WORTH THAT. GAUGING OURSELVES. AND THAT THIS SO GET THE MOST. SUSTAINABLE TARGETED. DEVELOPMENT SUPPORT TO THOSE COMMUNITIES THE SAFEST MOST PRUDENT AND IMPACTFUL MANNER. AB OUT FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THIS I'M HAPPY TO PROVIDE A LINK TO THE COMMITTEE. OF THAT IS THERE IS A SIGN NEWS FDIC REPORT CALLED INVESTING IN THE FUTURE OF MISSION DRIVEN BANKS. AND OTHER IS ABUNDANT INFORMATION IN THERE ABOUT THAT. SO LET ME JUST CONCLUDE BY- JUST TALK ABOUT WHAT CALIFORNIA CAN DO TO GROW CITY FIIS AND THEIR CAPACITY. AND I THINK THERE ARE MANY CHALLENGES CERTAINLY LISTED ADVICE IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE FRANKLY THEY'VE BEEN THE COLLECTED. IN TERMS OF HOW WE LIFT THEM UP TO DO THE WORK THAT THEY I HAVE BEEN CHARGED TO DO. END UP PROVIDING BROAD REACH INTO UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. FIRST ACCESS THE CAPACITY OF CALIFORNIA BASED CD ADVISED TO MANAGE CAPITAL- MEET OPERATIONAL BENCHMARKS AND THEN USES METRICS TO IDENTIFY SUFFICIENT CAPITAL MOUNTS THE. TO SCALE UP NEAR MONDAY. SECONDLY CAN CALL THE LORD BANKS DEPLOY AND CAP. I CAN BET. THE ORDER OF TWO. OF PROFITS OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS TO THE BEST A CITY ADVISED. AND ADDRESS EQUITY ISSUES. A LARGE BANKS COULD ALSO PROVIDE FINANCIAL SUPPORT THROUGH ASSET MANAGEMENT FUNDS ANOTHER WAY TO SUPPORT CAPITAL INVESTMENT. ADVICE THIRD WE WANT TO RESOLVE THE TECHNOLOGICAL AND MODERNIZATION CHALLENGES OF CD UP EYES AND THEIR OVER RELIANCE ON PAPER PROCESSING. WHICH OBVIOUSLY IMPEDES THE ABILITY OF THOSE INSTITUTIONS TO QUICKLY PROCESS TRANSACTIONS. FOURTH WE'RE HERE IN CALIFORNIA THE TECH CAPITAL OF THE WORLD I WOULD ALSO BE CALLED COUNT CALIFORNIA'S TECH COMPANIES TO COLLABORATE WITH CITY ADVISED TO DETERMINE THEIR SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY UPGRADE NEEDS AND CALL UPON LARGE BANKS TO HELP FUNDTHESE UPGRADES ARE REQUISITE STAFF TRAINING. IF WE CAN SUPPORT CITY ADVISED- YOU STILL THERE STAFF CAPACITY AND TALENT BY CALLING UPON LEADING FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO. DONATE AND SUPPORT INTERNSHIP AND FELLOWSHIP SERVICES THAT SUPPORT RISING STARS TO CREATE SYSTEMS TO SUCCEED LONG TERM.

THE CONTROLLER IS MAKING SURE THAT WE CAN PAY ALL OF OUR BILLS- I KNOW SHE TALKED EXTENSIVELY ABOUT THE PMI A ACCOUNTS. AND THE BANK OF NORTH DAKOTA I WON'T COVER THAT- BUT WE ALSO AYE SHE TALKED ABOUT EXPANDING THE ROLE OF THE CDFI WHICH WE ARE VERY VERY SUPPORT. ABOUT HERE IN THE TREASURER'S OFFICE- ON JUST A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ME IN MY BACK. I AM THE OLDER CHILD IMMIGRANT PARENTS. ARE I AM A SEAT. AT TAX ACCOUNTANT- TRAINED- STARTED MY PROFESSIONAL CAREER WITH MY THE BIG ACCOUNTING. BACKED AND- MY OWN PRACTICE THE AGE OF TWENTY EIGHT AND BECAME PRESIDENT OF THE ASIAN BUSINESS ASSOCIATION. AND THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME I EVER GOT INVOLVED IN POLITICS- AND STARTED TO REALIZE THAT ALTHOUGH SMALL BUSINESSES ARE THE BACKBONE OF. THE ECONOMY AND MANY OF OUR OUR RELATIVES AND FOR FATHERS AND MOTHERS CAME TO THIS COUNTRY. ARE STARTING A SMALL BUSINESS BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE. NECESSARILY THE EDUCATION OR THE SKILLS- DIFFERENT TYPE OF- JOBS. ARE THAT LOVES ARE THE BACKBONE OF THE ECONOMY BUT IT'S SO HARD. TO RUN AND OPERATE AND BE SUCCESSFUL AS A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER AND SO THAT'S WHERE MY PASSION FOR PUBLIC SERVICE STARTED REALLY- MAKING SURE THAT. I'M A VOICE FOR SMALL BUSINESS AND TRYING TO. DO AS MUCH OUTREACH AND AWARENESS AND EDUCATION. TO HELP SMALL BUSINESSES BUT ALSO TO HELP KEEP THEM OUT OF TROUBLE. NOW AS YOUR STATE TREASURER- I OVERSEE THREE MAIN DIVISIONS THE FIRST IS OUR CASH MANAGEMENT SO ALL OF THE REVENUES TAXI BY. OUR PENALTY INTEREST COMES INTO OUR BANK TOTALING ABOUT TWO POINT SIX TRILLION DOLLARS A YEAR- I'M PLEASE STAND. WHATEVER THE CONTROLLER NEEDS ARE TO PAY OUR- BILLS AND THEN THE REST I INVEST OUR THROUGH OUR INVESTMENTS DIVISION SO WE HAVE ABOUT A HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS IN SHORT TERM. OUR PORTFOLIO FUNDS. AND ONLY 30% REALLY ISN'T THERE- 18% 80% OF THAT AND THE CONTROLLER TALKED ABOUT HOW WE NEED THAT MONEY- RAINY DAY OR EMERGENCY. OUR THIRTY- THE PORT. IS FOR LOCAL GOT. ARE WE MANAGE- THE IDLE CASH FOR ABOUT TWO TWO WILL BECOME ENTITIES. ARE AND SO THEY ENTRUST THEIR MONEY WITH US IN THE LOCAL AREA INVESTMENT BOND AND WE CANNOT TOUCH THAT MONEY THAT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT WE CAN- APPROPRIATE AFTER THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- I ALSO- SHARE THE- PUBLIC FINANCE. OUR DIVISION WHICH ISSUES ALL OF THE STATE BONDS THE GENERAL OBLIGATION BONDS REVENUE BONDS AS WELL AS THE AGENT OF SALE BORN B. HI. UC'S MSTS USE AMONG OTHERS. ARE AND OUR BOND PORTFOLIO IS ABOUT NINETY BILLION DOLLARS RIGHT NOW AND THE GOOD NEWS EVEN DURING THE PANDEMIC IN APRIL WITH THE FIRST STATE TO GO BACK INTO. THE MARKET TO SELL OUR BONDS WE WERE A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS BUT- THE MARKET- BUT STRONG AND INVESTORS HAVE A LOT OF CONFIDENCE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND SINCE THEN WE'VE ISSUED ABOUT TEN DIFFERENT. BONDS THAT HAVE BEEN HIGHLY. SOUGHT OUT BY INVESTORS SO THAT'S THE GOOD NEWS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I ALSO CHAIR FIFTEEN DIFFERENT BOARDS AUTHORITIES AND COMMISSIONS- AND MANY OF THEM ARE FUNDING AND FINANCING HOSPITALS SCHOOLS. PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION AFFORDABLE HOUSING GREEN ENERGY ADVANCED MANUFACTURING. AND THE LIGHT AND I JUST WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SOME OF THE PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR THE MEMBERS THAT ARE LISTENING- ON THIS CALL. ARE IN TERMS OF TRYING TO MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. OUR FIRST UNDER MY- JURISDICTION IS OUR CAL CAP FOR SMALL BUSINESS- WE PROVIDE A LOAN LOSS GUARANTEED TO CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. ARE SO THAT THEY WILL BE ENCOURAGED TO LOANS TO THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE MAYBE. YOU KNOW WHAT- THE CREDIT ISN'T THAT GOOD OR THEY'RE HAVING- PROBLEMS ACCESSING THE MARKET SO THINK OF THE CAL CAP OR SMALL BUSINESS AB THE LENDER OF LAST RESORT. THEN I ALSO SIT ON THE AYE BANKING THINK SCOTT WE MAY TALK ABOUT THIS BUT THE GOVERNOR EARLIER APRIL TWENTY TWENTY PUT FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. IN CHIU THE I THANK A SMALL BUSINESS PROGRAM. WHICH IN THE LONG GETS. PRO AND THAT IS ALL VERY POP AND OVERS SUBSCRIBED AND AGAIN HEALTH THOSE UNDER COMMUNITIES HARD TO ACCESS. OF BOTH- WHO ARE JUST HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME. ACCESSING THE PPP OR EVEN THE E. IDL LOAN SO THOSE TWO PROGRAMS ARE AVAILABLE. FOR A SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS. THEN SOMEONE DID MENTION- LAST WEEK LAST FRIDAY THE GOVERNOR. OPEN UP A NEW PROGRAM THE CALIFORNIA BE BUILDING FUNDS AND THIS IS ALSO TO HELP SMALL BUSINESSES WILL EMPLOY LESS THAN FIFTY EMPLOYEES. ARE WITH REVENUES OF LESS THAN TWO POINT FIVE MILLION THE LOWER PAYMENT TIME IS THREE TO FIVE YEARS WITH A FOUR POINT 25% FIXED RATE OF. INTEREST IN IT ARE AN APPLICANT I DOES QUALIFIED THEY WILL BE MATCHED UP WITH THE CBF FIVE TO HELP THEM THROUGH THE PROCESS OF THE LOAN PROCESS. AS WELL AS MANAGING THEM UP THROUGH- BE PAYMENT A LONG TERM SO THAT IS A NEW PROGRAM WE THANK THE GOVERNOR. FOR PUTTING MORE MONEY INTO THAT. AND WE ARE ALSO UNDERSTOOD THAT THE CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY LACKS ANY STATE SUPPORTED PROGRAM TO INCENTIVIZE BANKS AND CREDIT UNIONS TO OPEN UP BANKS. UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES HOWEVER. MY INVESTMENTS DIVISION HAS A TIME DEPOSIT PROGRAM WHERE WE PUT MONEY INTO LOCAL HEADQUARTERED CALIFORNIA BANKS. ARE WE PUT ANYWHERE FROM TWENTY FIVE MILLION TO TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS WITH THE BANK SO THAT THEY CAN LOAN IT OUT. TO THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITIES- WE EXPANDED OUR THE POOL TO INCLUDE MORE BAGS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY THE CENTRAL COAST. ON THE NORTH STATE AS WELL AS THE SOUTHERN STATES- AND ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE IS A DISASTER EVENT LIKE A FIRE. MY FOLKS ARE CALLING TO MAKE SURE. THAT THE BANK THE LOCAL BANKS WHETHER THEY NEED A LITTLE BIT OF ASSISTANCE ARE WE CAN INFUSE MONEY AND THEY CAN LEARN HOW TO GET. OF THE COMMUNITY ARE BACK ON TRACK ARE CURRENTLY. THE AMOUNT THAT IS DEPOSITED IN LOCAL AGAIN LOCAL HEADQUARTERED COMMUNITY BANKS IS ABOUT. FOUR POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS. THIS AND ONE OF THE THAT WE NEED WITH THE WAS SENATOR BRADFORD BUILT IN TWENTY NINETEEN SB SIX SEVEN FORTY SEVEN. THIS WOULD HAVE CREATED BANKING DEVELOPMENT DISTRICTS SUPERVISED BY THE DPO OR THE NEW DECAF PI SIMILAR TO WHAT NEW YORK HAS ARE SINCE NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN AND IT WOULD ENCOURAGE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF BANKS. OF BANK BRANCHES OFF THAT WOULD SERVE DEMONSTRATED NEEDS- TEN MILLION DOLLARS WOULD GO TO EACH OF THESE- BRANCH BANKS THAT OPENS. AND WE THINK THAT THAT IS A GOOD IDEA GOOD BUILT SINCE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS UNDERSTAND THE NEEDS OF THEIR COMMUNITIES THE BEST. AND SO I JUST WANT TO- YOU KNOW CONCLUDE BY SAYING THAT- AB THREE TEN- IN THAT LETTER I SUBMITTED TO THE COMMITTEE I AM NOT AGAINST EXPLORE RIGHT. THE BY BILITY UPSTATE BANK BUT WANT TO BORROW APPROPRIATE STUDY AND HOW WE CAN DO THIS WITHOUT PUTTING CALIFORNIA'S BUDGET AND CREDIT RATING AT BEST. WE WERE NEUTRAL ON AB EIGHT FIFTY SEVEN I MEAN. BUT WE THOUGHT THAT THAT WAS A GOOD IDEA- BECAUSE DID NOT WORK. A IN THE FINDINGS SOURCES IN WAS GOING TO BE SOUTH. AND WERE. ANDERSON LOOKING TO ONE LA R. SAN FRANCISCO AS WELL AS THE EAST BAY CITIES THAT ARE GOING TO TAKE THE LEAD BUT CREATING THESE MUNICIPAL BACK SO I AM AVAILABLE. THANK YOU CAN ANSWER ANY OTHER TECHNICAL QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU TREASURE MALL BEFORE WE MOVE TO THE NEXT FOUND ARE GOING TO OPEN IT UP FOR QUESTIONS FROM ANY OF MY COLLEAGUES HERE. IN THE CHAMBER REMOTELY- WHICH ANYONE HAVE QUESTIONS FOR EITHER A CONTROLLER OR TREASURER. MISTER CHAIRMAN- JIM NIELSEN ABOUT MIKE I'VE BEEN HERE FOR A COMMENT GO RIGHT AHEAD SOONER. MISTER CHAIRMAN THAT I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THIS MOST RECENT TESTIMONY. FROM OUR STATE ELECTED OFFICIALS RESPONSIBLE OF THIS VERY. GENERALLY I WILL NOTE THAT THIS IS A LOT HAS A LONG HISTORY. THE LAST TIME THAT THIS GAINS TRACTION THAT CALIFORNIA WAS THE LATE SEVENTIES. I STATE BANK. IT WAS LOOKED AT AT THE TIME IS YOUR CURIOSITY. BUT THEN NOT IS A GOOD IDEA. AND IT DID NOT ADVANCE. I. I AM REMINDED THAT WE ARE TRYING HERE TO REINVENT THE WHEEL. AND IS THAT NECESSARY I THINK NOT EDT IT WAS MENTIONED. EARLIE IN THIS TESTIMONY TODAY IF THERE'S ANY AGENCY OF GOVERNMENT THAT DOES NOT WORK. IT CDD NOW THERE ARE MANY WHO DO NOT WORK TO THOSE WHO PUT THEIR CONFIDENCE IN ALL OF THE ANSWERS BEING A STATE ENTITY IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE A STATE BANK. THAT IS FRAUGHT WITH GREAT DANGER. EDIT SUBJECTS THE ADMINISTRATIVE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH IF YOU WILL. TO A ROLL OF LEGISLATION KNOW WHAT I MEAN BY THAT. A BIG PART OF THIS. EARLIER AFTER THE STATE BANK WAS TOUTING SOCIALLY CONSCIOUS INVESTING. THAT IS RISKY BUSINESS TO SAY THE LEAST. ANYONE WILL ATTEST TO THAT. IF WE'RE GOING TO DO POLICY THEN LET'S DO IT THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS WHICH IS MUCH MORE DELIBERATE PROCESS IN SETTING UP AN AGENCY OF GOVERNMENT WHO GUIDED ADMINISTRATIVELY. MERELY BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE REGULATIONS EARLY SUBJECT TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES ACT BUT THAT SHE GET FROM JACK'S THE CITIZENS TO GREAT. GREAT POLICY AND ECONOMIC RISK. CALIFORNIA IS A NO GOOD POSITION TO BE PROBLEMS MANY THANKS. WE ARE TOUTED TO BE FOR EXAMPLE THE HIGH TECH CAPITAL OF THE WORLD. AND ALMOST NONE OF THESE MULTI BILLION DOLLAR HI TECH PROJECTS. IT BRACED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAVE COME IN ON TIME. NOR ON BUDGET. IT'S BEEN A HUGE EMBARRASSED. AND ALL THE STATE HAS DONE IS TREATED AGENCIES SUPPOSEDLY TO. STRAIGHTENED THE MESS OUT IT'S BEEN AROUND I THINK SIX YEARS SEVEN MAYBE EVEN EIGHT YEARS. AND ALL IT'S MOSTLY ACCOMPLISHED IS TO CHANGE ITS NAME. TWO OR THREE TIMES. IF CALIFORNIA CANNOT GET CHECKED RIGHTS. THAT'S A PRETTY SAD STATE. THANK YOU MY POINT IS IT BE WARY TO PUT A LOT OF TRUST. IN OUR FUTURE AND BANKING IN A QUOTE STATE BANK. AND EVEN MENTION NORTH DAKOTA. AS RELATIVE TO AN ARGUMENT OR SOMETHING LIKE THIS IN CALIFORNIA IS LUDICROUS. THERE IS NO COMPARISON. AND I WOULD ARGUE THAT NORTH DAKOTA IS DEFICIENT SYSTEM IN THE SOUTH BUT THAT SAID IT IS MINUSCULE COMPARED TO THE COMPLEXITIES IN THE MAGNITUDE OF WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE CALIFORNIA. SO WHEN WE GET EXCITED ABOUT THE GENERAL WE'RE GONNA. SO WE CAN STILL HARM. PARDON WE'RE JUST GONNA SHOULD YOU EVER QUESTION SO WE CAN STAY ON TIME WE'RE JUST TRYING TO STAY ON NO NO I'M SORRY MR CHAIRMAN NO I DO NOT I WAS MAKING AN OBSERVATION BUT I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE AN APPROPRIATE TIME FOR THAT OBSERVATION THANK YOU FOR YOUR INDULGENCE I MAY HAVE SOME COMMENTS I WILL COME BACK TO YOU FOR SURE I SEE I HAVE SENATOR CAFIERO WOULD QUESTION AND THEN I WILL GO TO SENATOR RUSSELL CENTER PROBABLY ARE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR I ATE I DON'T HAVE A QUESTION I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I AM. THIS IS REALLY BEEN A GREAT HEARING AND HAVE. HAVING SUCH TALENT. AND AND EXPERTISE. IN ALL OF THE WITNESS THIS IS- IS REALLY INCREDIBLE AND I AND I SAY THAT BECAUSE- I- I THINK THERE ARE REALLY GOOD ALTRUISTIC REASONS FOR HAVING A STATE BANK. BUT I ALSO FEEL JUST AS STRONGLY THAT IT'S ALWAYS FRAUGHT WITH DANGER WHEN THE STATE OR GOVERNMENT WALKS INTO THE PRIVATE SECTOR. ARENA AND SAYS WE THINK WE CAN DO A BETTER JOB OF IT THAN YOU- OR WE HAVE A DIFFERENT GOAL IN MIND BY DOING IT OUR WAY AND- I. I WAS INVOLVED IN THE BEGINNING OF A BANK. AND I'VE SEEN THE STRUGGLES. AND MAKING DECISIONS AND CHOICES- THANKFULLY THE BANK STILL EXISTS BUT- WE SET IT UP TO BE AN ALTRUISTIC BANK AND IN THE END I THINK. IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO GET THERE- FOR SOME REAL PRACTICAL FINANCIAL REASONS AND SO IF A PRIVATE INDUSTRY BANK HAS A HARD TIME OF IT- THEN WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT WHAT. WHAT THE SOLUTION IS I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU REALLY- I'M INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT INFORMATION AND- AND- THIS IS NOT GOING TO GO AWAY I THINK THEY'LL CONTINUE TO BE A DISCUSSION BUT THERE ARE SOME LESSONS LEARNED. I THINK THAT- THAT THAT WE'LL SEE IN- IN THE MUNICIPAL BANKING. ARENA SO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THAT'S ALL I HAVE. THANK SENATOR. UNEXCEPTIONAL DORADO. THANK YOU- MISTER- NOT A QUESTION BUT JUST MAYBE IN SOME OTHER WAY WE COULD ADDRESS THIS I UNDERSTAND THAT- THE CURRENT LEGISLATIVE VERSION DOES NOT INCLUDE THE PMI. M. I. A. FUNDS- SO AT SOME POINT WE SHOULD CLARIFY THAT BUT- IT IS BOTH A AND R. IS STEAMED AND I. THE DOOR OUR CONTROLLER AND I TREASURE YOU ALL YOUR HISTORY IS SPEAKS FOR ITSELF YOU STAND FOR OUR COMMUNITY I GUESS MY BASIC QUESTION IS- IF THAT THE STATE BANK DOESN'T WORK I'D LIKE TO HEAR MORE ABOUT AGAIN DOESN'T HAVE TO BE NOW BUT IN THE FUTURE MORE ABOUT WINE. OR HOW TO MAKE SURE IT CAN WORK WHAT SHOULD WE DO TO MAKE IT WORK FOR US BECAUSE FRANKLY TO SAY THAT THE CURRENT SYSTEM. EVEN THE FINANCING THAT GOES FROM BANKS TO THE CDFI. THAT'S NOT WORKING- I GUESS SOMEONE FROM A PANELIST MENTIONED SOMETHING THAT IT WOULD TAKE US SEVENTY YEARS AT THIS RATE AT THIS PACE- TO GET THE- FINANCIAL TOOLS THAT ARE NEEDED IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND OUR POOR COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. SO I DON'T GET. I'M SORRY FOR THE POINT OF VIEW THAT IS NOT WORKING WE'RE NOT GETTING THE FUNDING- THAT WE SHOULD IN OUR COMMUNITIES PERIOD UNLESS WE HAVE SOME REAL TEETH INTO IT. IT IS IT'S GOING TO GO ON AND ON LIKE THIS FOREVER THIS IS BEEN GOING ON SINCE YOU KNOW I WAS A HIGH SCHOOL OR COLLEGE ACTIVIST I MEAN THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN OUT THERE FOR YOU. YOU KNOW DECADES AND DECADES WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO COME UP WITH EIGHT COUNTY SYSTEM TO THE WAY THE CURRENT BANKING SYSTEM- ADDRESSES OUR NEEDS IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND IT'S OUR PUBLIC FUNDING. SO THE PRIVATE SECTOR TAKES ADVANTAGE OF OUR FUNDS BUT DOESN'T RECIPROCATE IN THE WAY THAT IT SHOULD WITH OUR COMMUNITY SO. IT'S A BROAD QUESTION. BUT I DON'T GET THAT WE THAT OUR CURRENT SYSTEM. WAS WORKING AT ALL IT'S FAR FROM WORKING AND OF THE BANKS ALWAYS SEEM TO BE IN THE PLACE OF BEING PART OF THE CULPRIT AND THE PROBLEM AS TO WHY OUR COMMUNITIES DON'T GET WHAT THEY NEED. ESPECIALLY SMALL BUSINESSES. GREAT THANK YOU. MY BROTHER WEAPON I'M SORRY NOT RESPOND CENTRE BRADFORD. YEAH TRIDUUM. THANK YOU- SO YES TO SENATOR D'AMATO- YOU KNOW COME FROM- A MINORITY- COMMUNITY WE KNOW THAT IF- FOLKS ARE NOT- DELIBERATES. ABOUT NEEDING CERTAIN GOAL WELL THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN AND THAT'S WHY THE CALIFORNIA REINVESTMENT ACT UP PASSED TO ENCOURAGE MORE INVESTMENT IN CERTAIN UNDER SERVED COMMUNITIES I KNOW THAT WHEN WE PUT MORE MONEY INTO CERTAIN PROGRAMS THEY REALLY DO WORK AND I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROGRAMS I THANK GOD SENATORS. I MEAN WHICH YOU MENTIONED AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUT GOVERNOR NEWSOM LAST FISCAL YEAR ALLOCATED FIVE HUNDRED MILLION IN LOW INCOME STATE TAX CREDITS ANY ALLOCATED ANOTHER FIVE HUNDRED MILLION THIS YEAR AND BECAUSE OF THAT WE ARE OVERSUBSCRIBED IN OUR BONDS BECAUSE THOSE 4% TAX CREDITS HAVE TO BE MATCHED WITH OUR BONDS AND WE HAVE A LIMIT OF FOUR POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN HOW MUCH BOND CAPACITY WE HAVE BUT. BECAUSE OF THAT EXTRA BOOST. WE NOW ARE GOING TO. BE ALL AFFORDABLE HOUSING COME TO MARK. QUICKER THAN IN PAST SO WE APPRECIATE THE FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN THE BANK FOR SMALL BUSINESS. THE ADDITIONAL TWENTY FIVE MILLION BUT WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION RIGHT THAT'S WHAT IS GOING TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING YOU CAN SEE THAT MONEY DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN MOVING THE NEEDLE. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN AB SIDE YES SO. RESPOND TO CONTROL YOUR AUTHORITY THANK YOU- SENATOR ALSO THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTIONS AND IT IS- YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT YOU KNOW OVER TIME WE HAVE NOT SEEN MUCH IMPROVEMENT BUT I THINK THAT SUB BECAUSE OF REALLY- NOT ASSISTING- FRANKLY STRATEGY OR INVESTMENT IN TERMS OF HOW WE STRENGTHEN AND COULD YOU DESCRIBE THE CITY OF EYES. AND I'M ACTUALLY VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE- RECOVERY FUND BECAUSE OF THIS IS ONE WHERE- YOU KNOW OVER TIME I COULD SEE THAT I BANKS- THE FUND THAT'S JUST BEEN LAUNCHED BUT I BANKS BEING CLOSER TO WHAT THE BANK OF NORTH DAKOTA- ACTUALLY IS DOING IN TERMS OF PETITIONS AND SO YOU KNOW WHAT. I THINK REALLY THAT THE- YOUR INITIAL QUESTION. RESONATED WITH AND OUT OF SOME. OF THESE OUR COMMUNITY THAT. WHERE OF ONE SIZE FITS ALL DOZEN WORK- THESE ARE COMMUNITIES HAVE SPECIAL NEEDS THIS ARE COMMUNITIES THAT NEED- INDIVIDUAL ATTENTION. AND IT IS- RELATE I THINK IMPORTANT TO HAVE INSTITUTIONS THAT UNDERSTAND AND ARE ABLE TO HELP AFFECTED REACHED. INTO THESE COMMUNITIES THAT. AND OBVIOUSLY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CDS LIES BUT FRANKLY FOR NOT GOING AFTER THAT CAPITAL ONE THESE LARGE BANKS ARE LIKE. THEIR TRIPLE OVER THERE. TRYING TO- GET PROFITS TO WORK FOR THESE COMMUNITIES A CALIFORNIA'S TO STEP UP AND GET OUR SHARE. AND I ONCE WE DO WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO- REALLY ELEVATE THE CAPACITY OF THE CDFI SEMI TECHNOLOGICALLY. SOME OF THEM WERE VERY- HELPFUL IN TERMS OF BEING THE CONDUIT FOR PDP ASSISTANCE- DURING THE- PANDEMIC- WITH THAT PROGRAM WAS IN PLACE ON BECAUSE THEY DID NOT HAVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH TRADITIONAL. BANKING INSTITUTIONS BUT MANY WERE NOT HELPFUL BECAUSE- THEY DON'T HAVE THE ECONOMIC STILL IN TERMS OF DOING THE LOAN PROCESS. AND SO THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE TO ELEVATE IS JUST THE CAPACITY. OF BEING SURE THAT WE'RE DIRECTING I MEAN THE BIG BANKS OF MONEY TO GET FOR THIS I SAY TAKE. A START REALLY USING IT TO THE STRENGTHEN THE INSTITUTIONS WE KNOW ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS AT LEAST THE COMMUNITIES OF THE FLEXIBLE. ABOUT HOW WE'RE GETTING THAT ASSSTANCE OUT THERE. THANK YOU. ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS FROM. C. NINE WE'RE GOING MOVE ON CHIU THE NEXT. WHILE I'M IN SEE IF- CAN G. AN TREASURY ARE YOU SHOULD GOING TO STAY ON AFTER ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS THAT COME UP.

THIS PROGRAM WAS LAUNCHED WITH AN INITIAL FUNDING REQUEST FROM THE STATE'S GENERAL FUND BUT WAS APPROVED WITHOUT FINDING BECAUSE OF KOBE NINETEEN IS IMPACT ON THE STATE'S BUDGET. I BANK HOWEVER IS SEEKING TO CAPITALISE CALLOUS FUND IN NEW AND CREATIVE WAYS BECAUSE OF THE URGENT NEED. THE CREATIVE SOLUTIONS THEME HAS BEEN PERVASIVE FOR US OVER THIS ENTIRE YEAR AS WE ALSO FACE THE CHALLENGE OF PROVIDING FOR THE SUPPORT FOR SMALL BUSINESSES.

JUST LUNCH ON FRIDAY THIS PROGRAM WILL RELY ON A NEW PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP COLLABORATIVE TO ADDRESS THE CAPITAL ADVISORY NEEDS OF CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESSES AS THEY REOPEN AND RECOVER FROM PANDEMIC.

FOR THE FIRST THREE YEARS OF OPERATION THE DEPARTMENT CONDUCTS A YEARLY ASSESSMENT. AFTER THAT WE MOVED INTO AN EXAM CYCLE BASED ON ASSET SIZE OF THE INSTITUTION. THANK THAT ARE LESS THAN THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN TOTAL ASSETS ARE EXAMINED EVERY EIGHTEEN MONTHS AND THOSE WITH MORE THAN THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN ASSETS ARE EXAMINED EVERY TWELVE MONTHS. THOSE WITH MORE THAN TEN BILLION DOLLARS IN ASSETS ARE EXAMINED ANNUALLY. AND WITH SEVERAL TARGETED REVIEWS THAT ARE PERFORMED THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. IF A BANK AT ANY TIME BECOMES TROUBLED AND WE DEFAULT BACK TO A MORE AGGRESSIVE ANNUAL EXAMINATION CYCLE THAT INCLUDES IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF COURSE IN PERSON VISITS EVERY SIX MONTHS UNTIL OPERATIONS RETURN THREE SATISFACTORY LEVEL. BUT TROUBLED BANK IS ONE THAT EXISTS TO SOME DEGREE OF SUPERVISORY CONCERN IN AREAS THAT ARE RELATED TO CAPITAL ASSET MANAGEMENT PRACTICES EARNINGS BUT QUALITY. AND SENSITIVITY TO MARKET RISK. THE MAY HAVE SEVERAL VIOLATIONS OF LAW AND ARE NOT ADEQUATELY COMPLIED WITH THE LAW. A BANK BECOME SATISFACTORY WHAT WE ARE SURE THAT THE BANK IS FUNDAMENTALLY SOUND AND CAN WITHSTAND BUSINESS FLUCTUATIONS. AND THE INSTITUTION ALIGNS COMES IN SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW. I MEAN I'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT THE DEPARTMENT TYPICALLY DOES WITH ANY ISSUES THAT ARISE THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF THE EXAMINATION PROCESS. IF THE DEPARTMENT FINDS THAT A BANK LICENSEE IS ACTING INAPPROPRIATELY. WE QUICKLY IDENTIFY HOW BEST TO RESPOND WE HAVE SEVERAL DIFFERENT OPTIONS AND TOOLS AT OUR DISPOSAL. ONE OPTION IS TO CONDUCT AN INFORMAL ENFORCEMENT ACTION THROUGH A MEMORANDUM FROM THE OF UNDERSTANDING BUT OUTLINES FORMAL RECOMMENDATIONS THE DEPARTMENT IS ASKING THE BANK TO TAKE IN ORDER TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE. WELL THESE ARE NOT PUBLICLY NOR THE LEGALLY BINDING THEY DO ENSURE THAT A BANK EXPLICITLY UNDERSTANDS THE STEPS IT NEEDS TO TAKE IN ORDER TO. BECOME A IN ORDER TO COME INTO GOOD STANDING WITH THE DEPARTMENT. ALTERNATIVELY THE BANK THE DEPARTMENT CAN ALWAYS TAKE FORMAL ACTION. AGAINST AN INSTITUTION IF THE SEVERITY OF ISSUES THAT THE INSTITUTION OF RISE TO THAT LEVEL SUCH FORMAL ACTION CAN INCLUDE ANY OF THE FOLLOWING. PLACING THE BANK UNDER A FORMAL ORDER EITHER INDEPENDENTLY OR ALONGSIDE THE FDIC. ORDERING THE BANK TO CEASE AND DESIST FROM VIOLATING THE LAW OR ACTING IN AN UNSAFE OR UNSOUND MANNER. THESE ACTIONS MAY CAUSE INSOLVENCY- SIGNIFICANT DISSIPATION OF ASSETS OR EARNINGS. WEAKENED CONDITIONS OR PREJUDICE CONSUMER INTERESTS. WE MAY ALSO SEND AN ORDER RELATING TO AN ACTOR BOOKS OR RECORDS. ALTERNATIVELY WE CAN ORDER THE SUSPENSION OR REMOVAL OF A PERSON OR A OR PROHIBITS PERSONS PARTICIPATION AND THE BANK'S OPERATIONS. IN EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES THE DEPARTMENT CAN EVEN TAKE POSSESSION OF THE BANK. ALL OF THOSE VARIETY OF TOOLS OKAY SURE THAT THE DEPARTMENT CAN ENFORCE CALIFORNIA LAW AND PROTECT CONSUMERS. LASTLY THE COMMITTEE TODAY AFTER TO DISCUSS ANY APPLICATIONS THAT WE'VE RECEIVED FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WISHING TO CREATE A LOCAL PUBLIC BANK PURSUANT TO BE A FIFTY SEVEN. AS AS OF TODAY WE HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY APPLICATIONS I SHOULD ALSO NOTE HOWEVER THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS NOT YET COMPLETED REGULATIONS RELATING TO LOCAL PUBLIC BANK APPLICATIONS UNDER AB EIGHT FIFTY SEVEN. WELL WE CAN'T ACCEPT APPLICATIONS WE CANNOT ACT UPON AN APPLICATION UNTIL THE APPLICATION IS FULLY COMPLETE. THE REGULATIONS THAT WERE WORKING ON WOULD HELP CLARIFY WHAT THE DEPARTMENT IS GOING TO NEED- WHO IS GOING TO BE LOOKING FOR AND OUT FOR A COMPLETE APPLICATION. THE NOTICE OF PROPOSED RULEMAKING SHOULD BE AVAILABLE ON FRIDAY DECEMBER FOURTH. FROM THAT POINT ON WE WILL HAVE FORTY FIVE DAYS OF PUBLIC COMMENTS AND WE EXPECT THE RULES TO BE FINALIZED- WITHIN THE YEAR. ONCE THOSE REGULATIONS ARE FINALIZED WE MAY SEE APPLICANTS BEGIN TO FILE WITH THE DEPARTMENT- AND I SHOULD CLARIFY MORE SPECIFICALLY I DID NOTICE IN THE BRIEFING MATERIAL- IN ONE OF THE- ONE OF THE Q. AND A.'S- THERE IS A- THERE IS A RESPONSE TO ONE OF THE QUESTIONS INDICATING THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAD. INDICATED THAT WE WOULD NOT ACCEPT APPLICATIONS UNTIL THE REGULATIONS WERE COMPLETE AGAIN I HOPE TO HAVE I HOPE THAT I'VE CLARIFIED THAT POINT- WE CERTAINLY WILL REVIEW APPLICATIONS WE CERTAINLY WOULD REVIEW APPLICATIONS AND WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO DO SO. BEFORE ANY REGULATIONS ARE COMPLETE- HOWEVER ANY SUCH APPLICATION WOULD ITSELF NEED TO BE COMPLETE- AND WE THINK IT IS LIKELY PRUDENT FOR ANY PROPOSED ORGANIZER'S TO WAIT UNTIL- THE REGULATION PROCESS IS COMPLETE. IN ORDER TO- IN ORDER TO BEGIN FILING SUCH AN APPLICATION. WITH THAT I WANT TO THANK- THANK YOU ALL FOR THE TIME AND I AND MY STAFF STAND READY TO.

CITIFIED ENABLE COMMUNITIES TO ACCESS CAPITAL THAT CREATES JOBS BUILDS AFFORDABLE HOUSING SUPPORT SMALL BUSINESSES CULTIVATE HEALTHY FOOD AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY. C. DEFIES ON PORTEN PART OF THE COUNTRY'S FINANCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE WORKING IN COMMUNITIES THAT ARE UNDER SERVED BY TRADITIONAL LENDERS. THE CALIFORNIA COALITION FOR COMMUNITY INVESTMENT IS A COALITION OF FORTY C. DEFIES WHICH PROVIDE INVESTING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ACROSS CALIFORNIA. OUR COALITION INCLUDES AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND SMALL BUSINESS LENDERS CREDIT UNIONS MICROLENS- IS HOUSING TRUST FUNDS AND OTHER MISSION DRIVEN FINANCIAL SUPPORT PROVIDERS.

AND WE HAVE BUILT OR PRESERVED OVER A HUNDRED AND NINETEEN THOUSAND AFFORDABLE HOMES. WE CONNECT THOSE HOMES TO COMMUNITY ASSETS THAT EXPAND RESIDENT OPPORTUNITY WITH OUR FINANCING HELPING TO CREATE OVER SIXTEEN THOUSAND EDUCATIONAL SEATS AND FACILITATING ROUGHLY SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND HEALTH CARE VISITS.

BUT CDCSMALL BUSINESS FINANCE WAS ABLE TO OFFER A SMALL BUSINESS LOAN AND ONGOING TRAINING AND ASSISTANCE TO HELP HIM BUILD HIS BUSINESS. OUR CITY IF I COALITION IS WATCHING CLOSELY THE DISCUSSION REGARDING THE POTENTIAL FORMATION OF A PUBLIC BANK IN CALIFORNIA. CDFI IS WORK TO BRING CAPITAL TO LOW INCOME AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES FROM THE PUBLIC GET BANK COULD BE LEVERAGED BY CEDIA FIGHTS. THESE FINANCIAL RESOURCES COULD INCLUDE CREATING A SECONDARY MARKET FOR CDFI ORIGINATED LOANS RESULTING IN GREATER LIQUIDITY. AND DIRECTLY INVESTING INCENTIVIZE TO STRENGTHEN OUR BALANCE SHEET. BOTH OF THESE ACTIVITIES WOULD ALLOW CDFI IS TO HAVE EVEN GREATER IMPACT IN THE COMMUNITIES WHERE WE WORK ONE MINUTE THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY AND PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT THE CDFI SECTOR. THIS FROM US THANK YOU SO MUCH GREAT JOB DO APPRECIATE YOUR WORDS TODAY AND THANK YOU SO MUCH. FOR BEING WITH US ON THIS THANKSGIVING WEEK IS FROM US IS GONNA BE HANGING OUT AND TO IF WE HAVE QUESTIONS. FROM SENATORS HERE IN JUST A FEW MOMENTS WILL BE ABLE TO ASK- HERE AT BUT FIRST WE'D LIKE TO BE RETURNED TO ROBERT WILSON. MISTER WILSON IS THE VICE PRESIDENT STATE GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS FOR THE CALIFORNIA CREDIT UNION LEAGUE HE'S GOING TO BE TESTIFYING FOR FIVE MINUTES O THIS ISSUE. MISTER WALKER MISTER WILSON WE WELCOME YOU TO COMMITTEE THE FLOOR IS YOURS OR- GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING CHAIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND SENATORS ARE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY. TO SPEAK WITH YOU ALL TODAY- AS CHAIR JUST THAT I'M VICE PRESIDENT STATE GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS AT THE CALIFORNIA CREDIT UNION LEAGUE. THE CALIFORNIA CREDIT UNION LEAGUE REPRESENTS NEARLY THREE HUNDRED CREDIT UNIONS. AND THEY'RE OVER TWELVE MILLION MEMBERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. I WANT TO TOUCH ON TWO MAIN POINTS DURING MY TESTIMONY TODAY. THE FIRST IS A TIME DEPOSIT PROGRAM. HOW FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE INVOLVED AND THE SECOND IS THE WORK IS BEEN DONE THUS FAR PUBLIC BANKING IN THE STATE. THE PILOT THE TIME DEPOSIT. WAS CREATED IN NINETEEN FORTY FIVE AND ALLOWS THE STATE TREASURER TO PLACE DEPOSITS WITH ELIGIBLE CALIFORNIA FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. ELIGIBLE INSTITUTIONS INCLUDE FEDERALLY INSURED COMMERCIAL BANKS SAVINGS BANKS AND CREDIT UNIONS OR AUTHORIZED TO ACCEPT DEPOSITS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE GOAL THE TIME DEPOSIT PROGRAM IS TO STIMULATE LOCAL ECONOMIES BY SUPPORTING LOCAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT SERVE THE INTERESTS OF THEIR COMMUNITIES. AS OF AUGUST THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY NEARLY PARTICIPATING IN THE PROGRAM WERE UNDER TEN BILLION DOLLARS IN ASSETS MEANING SMALL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. THIS PROGRAM BENEFITS THE SMALLER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS BY PROVIDING THEM WITH ANOTHER SORTS OF DEPOSITS THAT THEY MAY NEED TO SERVE THEIR COMMUNITIES. AND THE PROGRAM GENTLY OFFERS BETTER RATES AND AVAILABLE FROM OTHER SOURCES. THE TIME DEPOSIT PROGRAM BENEFITS THE COMMUNITIES BY STIMULATING GROWTH IN SMALL BUSINESSES AND HELPING COMMUNITIES THRIVE BY INCREASING THE NUMBER OF MORTGAGE LOANS AUTO LOANS AND OTHER LANDING IN THE COMMUNITY. THE PROPOSAL TO CHANGE THE STATE I MAKE A DEPOSIT A PUBLIC DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION WE'RE TAKING THESE IMPORTANT POSITIVE WAY FROM THE SMALL LOCAL FINANCIALS ACCUSED WITHIN FIVE YEARS. AND THAT'S THE WAY FOR SOME OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT THEY SERVE. THE GOAL OF PUBLIC BANKS TO SERVE THE COMMUNITIES WHICH WHAT CREDIT UNIONS AND COMMUNITY BANKS AND SEE IF AYE AYES ARE CURRENTLY DOING WITH THESE DEPOSITS. I WANT TO SHIFT GEARS AND BRIEFLY DISCUSS THE WORK THAT HAS BEEN DONE THUS FAR PUBLIC BANKING. AS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT A LITTLE BIT ALREADY LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE PASSED EIGHTY EIGHT FIFTY SEVEN WHICH ALLOWS CITIES AND REGIONS TO CREATE THEIR OWN PUBLIC BANKS AFTER SUBMITTING A PLAN. DEPARTMENT FINANCIAL PROTECTION INNOVATION. THIS IS A MONUMENTAL PIECE OF LEGISLATION ONE THAT PRETTY MUCH EVERYONE IN THIS VIRTUAL ROOM BARS WORKED VERY DILIGENTLY ON. ALL FOR A GREAT LEAGUE WAS NO DIFFERENT WE WERE ABLE TO MOVE TO A NEUTRAL POSITION AFTER A FEW ROUNDS AMENDMENT ON EIGHTY EIGHT FIFTY SEVEN. WE APPRECIATE. WHEN THE I. BANK PROPOSAL POPPED UP LAST YEAR MY MEMBER CREDIT USE HAVE ONE BIG QUESTION WHY NOW. EVEN IF WE ARE NOT IN A COVERT SHORTENED SESSION MY MEMBER PARTIES WERE STILL LEFT WONDERING WHY DO WE NOT SEE HOW AB FIFTY SEVEN PANS OUT. NOT EVEN A YEAR POST ENACTMENT DATE WE'RE GOING BACK TO THE WELL IN PUBLIC BANKING. ARE WE CLING LOCAL PUBLIC BANKS A SUCCESS ALREADY. OR WAS IT REALIZED WITHOUT THE STATE PUBLIC BANK THE LOCAL MODELS NOT POSSIBLE. WITH AB EIGHT FIFTY SEVEN THERE IS POTENTIAL FOR A PARTNERSHIP. BETWEEN LOCAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. AND THE LOCAL BANKS. AND WE STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD WAIT AND SEE HOW THAT PLAYS OUT BEFORE EXPAND THE SCOPE PUBLIC BANKING CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU. THIS WILSON THANK YOU SO MUCH WE APPRECIATE YOU BEING WITH US HERE TODAY THAT MISTER WILSON WILL ALSO BE HANGING OUT IF WE HAVE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM. THE SENATORS IN JUST A FEW MOMENTS WE'VE TO ADDITIONAL PANELISTS WHO WILL BE PARTICIPATING IN THIS FINAL PANEL LET'S GO TO JASON LANE HIS LINE IS VICE PRESIDENT DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT RELATIONS. THE CALIFORNIA BANKERS ASSOCIATION MISTER LANE WE WELCOME YOU TO COMMITTEE YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES AND I'LL GIVE YOU ONE MINUTE PROMPT SELLING THE FLOOR'S YOURS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. SHE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ON THIS MATTER WE AGREE WITH THE PRIOR COMMENTS THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS ALREADY ADDRESSED THE ISSUE OF PUBLIC BANKING. LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES ASKED FOR THE ABILITY TO CREATE PUBLIC BANKS AND THE LEGISLATURE GRANTED THEM THAT AUTHORITY THIS VERY LAST LEGISLATIVE SESSION. WELL THE PROPONENTS OF PUBLIC BANKS OF DISCUSSES VIRTUES WE STILL DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE PERCEIVED- BENEFITS OUTWEIGH THE RISKS PARTICULARLY WHEN WE CONSIDER THE GENERAL FUND IS THE RESCUE. TO HELP ILLUSTRATE THIS VIEW I'D LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT TO SPEAK ABOUT THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT THAT BANKS FIND THEMSELVES IN RIGHT NOW AND- I APOLOGIZE IN ADVANCE FOR USING BANK TERMINOLOGY. WELL THERE ARE PLENTY OF BANKS OFFERING SERVICES TO CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES THERE'S A GREAT DEAL OF CONSOLIDATION WITHIN THE INDUSTRY RIGHT NOW. INTEREST RATES ARE AT HISTORIC LOWS AND THEY LIKELY WILL BE FOR QUITE SOME TIME THIS IS RESULTED IN AN INDUSTRY WIDE DECREASE IN NET INTEREST INCOME WHICH IS AN INDICATOR OF THE BANKS PROFITABILITY. ONE OF BANKS NET INTEREST INCOME DECREASES WHILE THE BANK IS TRYING TO MAINTAIN ADEQUATE CAPITAL RATIOS ONE OF THE ONLY LOVERS OF BANK AND PULL AN EFFORT NOT TO LOSE MONEY IS AN EXPENSE REDUCTION. SO BANKS EFFICIENCY RATIO BECOMES VERY IMPORTANT. THIS RATIO IS A MEASURE OF A BANK'S OPERATING EXPENSE SO IT'S A VERY CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT FOR THE INDUSTRY RIGHT NOW AND THE STATE BANK IS GOING TO HAVE ALL THE SAME CHALLENGES. ONE OF THE QUESTIONS BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE IS CAN A STATE BANK BE EFFICIENT ENOUGH TO NOT LOSE MONEY IN THIS ENVIRONMENT WHICH CAN ABSOLUTELY HAPPEN. A PUBLIC BANKS OVERHEAD IN COST OF FUNDS OR GOING TO BE THE SAME AS A PRIVATE ENTITY AND IF THAT PUBLIC BANK IS. NOW GOING TO MAKE LOW INTEREST LOANS AS IT IS PROPOSED TO DO THAT IS GOING TO HAVE EVEN MORE OF A COMPRESSED NET INTEREST MARGIN AND HAVE TO BE EVEN MORE EFFICIENT. LAYER ON TOP OF THAT THE FACT THAT THE PROPONENTS ARE ADVOCATING FOR THIS PUBLIC BANK TO ENGAGE IN SOME FAIRLY RISKY LENDING ACTIVITY. SO NOW THE BANK IS GOING TO HAVE TO SET ASIDE EVEN MORE MONEY FOR LOSS RESERVES. AND PROVISION FOR IT ACCORDING TO REGULATION AND THAT'S GOING TO EAT INTO ITS CAPITAL. WE DON'T SEE HOW A PUBLIC BANK OPERATING IN THIS MANNER OUT LIKE BRED BY THE PROPONENTS AND CERTAINLY AS DESCRIBED. IN AB THREE TEN CAN SURVIVE IN THIS ENVIRONMENT CERTAINLY A PRIVATE ENTITY COULD NOT. AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHY YOU'RE SEEING SO MUCH CONSOLIDATION IN THE INDUSTRY RIGHT NOW BECAUSE IT'S A VERY CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT YOU DON'T SEE A LOT OF NEW BANKS. STARTING UP FOR THIS PARTICULAR REASON. NO WE ARE CERTAIN ENCOURAGE TO HEAR THAT PUBLIC BANK PROPONENTS ACCEPT THE IDEA THAT A PUBLIC BANK NEEDS TO BE REGULATED THOUGH THERE SEEMS TO BE SOME DISPUTE. AS TO WHETHER OR NOT DEPOSITS WOULD BE INSURED AS EIGHTY THREE TEN DID NOT REQUIRE THAT. WE BELIEVE THAT THAT REGULATION IS VITAL. VITALLY IMPORTANT TO THE SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS OF THE BANKING SYSTEM BUT WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT A PUBLIC BANK. MUST BE REGULATED IN THE SAME MANNER AS A PRIVATE INSTITUTION. S. TO DEPOSIT INSURANCE SINCE THESE ARE IN ESSENCE TAXPAYER DOLLARS REALLY GENERAL FUND REVENUE THEN THEY SHOULD ABSOLUTELY BE INSURED. BUT WHAT YOU'RE BEING ASKED TO DO AS A LEGISLATURE IS NOT JUST CONSIDER THE FORMATION OF AN INJURY THAT TAKES DEPOSITS AND MAKES LOANS. WHICH ARE ALSO BEING ASKED TO CONSIDER THE ENTIRE INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT THAT ENTITY. FOR EXAMPLE ONE OF THE AREAS THAT THE BANKING INDUSTRY HAS EXCELLED IN HIS CYBERSECURITY. BANKS OFTEN KNOW WHEN FRAUD HAS OCCURRED ON AN ACCOUNT BEFORE THE CUSTOMER DOES. THE IS VERY COMPLEX ALGORITHMS AND FRAUD FILTERS TO DETECT FRAUD. YOU JUST DON'T SEE A LOT OF DATA BREACHES OCCURRING IN THE BANKING INDUSTRY. BUT THERE'S A COST TO PROTECTING CUSTOMERS. THE LARGEST BANKS ARE SPENDING NORTH OF THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR AND IT INFRASTRUCTURE AND CYBERSECURITY. SO LEGITIMATE QUESTION BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE NOW IS DOES THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAVE THE IT SYSTEMS TO SUPPORT A BANKING NETWORK. AGAIN THIS IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF THE NUMEROUS. CHALLENGES OF PUBLIC BANK WILL HAVE. THEN THE NOTION THAT A PUBLIC BANK CAN BETTER SERVE ITS COMMUNITIES THAN PRIVATE ENTITIES. BUT STATE BANK WOULD HAVE NO BRICK AND MORTAR PRESENCE IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE PROPONENTS FOR PUBLIC BANKING CONTEND THAT THEY WILL PARTNER WITH LOCAL COMMUNITY BANKS AND CREDIT UNIONS. BUT IN ORDER FOR A PUBLIC BANK TO EXIST IT WOULD NEED TO TAKE DEPOSITS FROM STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. AND THESE DEPOSITS ARE CURRENTLY USED BY COMMUNITY BANKS PRIMARILY AS A SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY WHICH IS THEN GOING BACK INTO THE COMMUNITIES. THROUGH LENDING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. THAT WOULD NOT BE A PARTNERSHIP IN THAT SENSE AND IN FACT IT WOULD BE DEVASTATING TO SOME COMMUNITY BANKS. THEY WON'T BE AROUND FOR THAT PARTNERSHIP TO COME TO FRUITION. AND THIS IS A POINT THAT I CAN'T EMPHASIZE ENOUGH WHAT IS BEING PROPOSED IT'S JUST TAKE AWAY. VITAL LIQUIDITY FROM COMMUNITY BANKS THAT CURRENTLY HAVE A BRICK AND MORTAR PRESENCE IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. AND TRANSFERRING IT TO A STATE ENTITY THAT HAS NO BRICK AND MORTAR PRESENCE IN THE COMMUNITY. THAT WE LOST TO THE STATE BANKING CHARTER SYSTEM. BUT IT'S ALSO OING TO BE A MAJOR LOST YOUR COMMUNITIES ONE MINUTE. I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK TODAY AND I'M AVAILABLE FOR ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER LEHMAN LANE WE SPENT BEARD. THE DAYS. MY GOODNESS SIR GOOD TO YOU. IT'S BEEN AWHILE THANK YOU SO MUCH WE'RE REALLY GRATEFUL UP FOR YOU PARTICIPATING TODAY SIR. THANK YOU. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN COMMITTEE WERE NOW GOING TO BE MOVING ON TO THE TEAM THAT BURNING. SHE IS THE TREASURE- IN. NEVADA COUNTY PLUS SHE'S THE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COUNTY TREASURERS AND COLLECTORS. TREASURER AND TAX COLLECTOR'S THANK YOU SO MUCH BETTER PRESIDENT WE'RE GRATEFUL THAT YOU'RE WITH THIS MISS VERNON. GOOD MORNING THE FLOOR IS YOURS YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES AND I'LL GIVE YOU ONE MINUTE PROBLEMS GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. WELL GOOD MORNING ON A BILL SENATOR MCGUIRE AND SENATOR BRADFORD- I AM DELIVERED IN ABOUT A COUNTY TREASURER TAX COLLECTOR AND CURRENT CHARACTER PRESIDENT. I AM HERE TODAY THOUGH TO REPRESENT THE VIEWS OF THE CHARACTERISTICS AS THE ASIAN AND I DO THANK YOU FOR HEARING OR TESTIMONY TODAY ON THE SUBJECT OF PUBLIC BEING FUNDING. OUR FIRST I WANT TO BE CLEAR TO THE GROUP THAT THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COUNTY TREASURERS AND TAX COLLECTORS IS NOT AGAINST THE IDEA OF A PUBLIC BANK. AND WE DIDN'T FULLY UNDERSTAND MOTIVATION OF THE PUBLIC BANKING ADVOCATES. OF THEIR ACCOUNT IS RIGHT NOW WORKING WITH PUBLIC BANK ADVOCATES TO COMPLETE THE STUDY IS NEEDED TO SEE IF A PUBLIC HEARING THANK IS A VIABLE IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. WE ALL SERVE THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH WE LIVE AND WE CAN'T ENVISION THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS THAT A WELL ESTABLISHED PUBLIC BANK CAN PROVIDE TO OUR COMMUNITIES. WHERE WE DO DIFFER THOSE STEMS FROM HOW PUBLIC BANK IS FUNDED AND THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE BIRTH OF A PUBLIC BANK. WE HAVE AN EXAMPLE OF HOPING THAT-WORKS WE ALL HEARD ABOUT THE BANK OF NORTH DAKOTA. AND THE SUCCESSFUL BANK OF NORTH DAKOTA WAS ESTABLISHED IN NINETEEN NINETEEN AND TOOK OVER THIRTY YEARS TO BECOME SUSTAINABLE. AND IT DOES NOT SERVE THE SAME POPULATION OF CUSTOMERS OF THE PROPONENTS IN CALIFORNIA ARE SEEKING TO SERVE. AND LOCAL AGENCIES CAN VOLUNTARILY DEPOSIT FUNDS INTO THE BANK. CURRENT RESEARCH SHOWS THAT A PUBLIC BANKING CALIFORNIA ONCE FORMED COULD TAKE ABOUT TEN YEARS OR MORE TO BECOME SUFFICIENTLY SOLVENT ENOUGH FOR LOCAL AGENCY DEPOSIT. AND THIS PROCESS OF BECOMING FULLY REGULATED COULD TAKE YEARS AND BE EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE. THIS LONG AND EXPENSIVE PROCESS IS WHAT OTHER PUBLIC BASE THE FAILED AND THAT'S WHY WE ARE HESITANT TO COMMIT LOCAL AGENCY TAXPAYER DOLLARS. THROUGHOUT THE DISCUSSIONS ON EIGHTY EIGHT FIFTY SEVEN AND THEN AGAIN WITH EIGHTY THREE TEN WE'VE HEARD PUBLIC BEING PROPONENTS PROPOSE THE USE OF COUNTY DEPOSITS TO FUND THESE BANKS. AND TIME AND TIME AGAIN AND TOLD THEM THAT WE JUST COULD NOT SUPPORT THIS. EACH OF US TAKES AN OATH OF OFFICE TO SERVE AND PROTECT. TREASURES FROM AROUND THE STATE ALSO TAKE AN OATH TO UPHOLD THE PRUDENT INVESTOR STANDARD. WHICH STATES THAT WE MUST INVEST FUNDS OF THAT FIRST AND FOREMOST. THE SAFETY OF PRINCIPLES OF HEALTH. SECONDLY THAT WE NEED A LIQUIDITY NEEDS OF OUR COMMUNITIES SPECIFICALLY OUR LOCAL SCHOOLS ARE FIRE DISTRICT'S PUBLIC SAFETY DEPARTMENTS COUNTY HOSPITALS SUCH AS- THEY ALL MUST HAVE THE NECESSARY FUNDING AT THEIR FINGERTIPS WHEN NEEDED. TO PUT A FINER POINT TO IT THINK ABOUT THE COST COUNTIES IN SCHOOL THE PER DURING THIS PANDEMIC ALONE. THERE HAVE BEEN UNEXPECTED AND EXTRAORDINARY COSTS FOR PP HELLO WORKING SOCIAL DISTANCING MEASURES EVERYTHING THAT DISTANCE LEARNING REQUIRES. ALL THIS REQUIRED MONEY AND WHILE WE BELIEVE THERE'S GOING TO BE REIMBURSEMENT AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. IT IS RESPONSIBILITY OF COUNTY TREASURERS TO ENSURE THAT THIS LIQUIDITY AND ACCESS TO CASH IS AVAILABLE IMMEDIATELY IF NEEDED. AN ENTITY OR INVESTMENT THAT WOULD LOCK UP COUNTY OR SCHOOL CASH FOR A DECADE OR MORE IS NOT A PRUDENT WAY TO MANAGE THOSE DOLLARS. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT FUNDS HELD IN COUNTY TREASURER POOLS ARE NOT ACCESS FROM. THERE I DON'T FUNDS THAT WILL BE CALLED UPON AT SOME POINT IN TIME TO PAY FOR SALARIES CAPITAL PROJECTS AND EQUIPMENT NEEDS TO SERVE OUR COMMUNITY. THESE BONDS ARE PART OF THE PUBLICLY ADOPTED BUDGET DEVELOPED AND APPROVED BY OUR COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS SCHOOL BOARDS CITY COUNCILS AND GOVERNING BOARDS OF SPECIAL DISTRICTS. IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATE STATUTE COUNTY TREASURER'S CANNOT INVEST IN SECURITIES WITH MATURITY DATES GREATER THAN FIVE YEARS DUE TO THE SHORT TURNAROUND THESE FUNDS. HI LIQUIDITY NEEDS REQUIRE COUNTY TREASURER'S TO HAVE TIGHTENED ACCURATE COUNCIL PROJECTIONS TO ENSURE THAT CASH IS SUFFICIENT FOR ALL EXPENDITURES- JESUS COUNTIES AND CITIES AROUND STATE DEPOSIT MONIES INTO THE STATE LOCAL AGENCY INVESTMENT FUND. A% HIGHLY. PUBLIC ENTITIES AS I UNDERSTAND THE PROPOSAL OF THE LEGISLATION IS CONSIDERING TODAY INCLUDES THE USE OF COUNTY AND CITY DOLLARS THAT ARE ON THE POCKET WITH PMA AND LYFT. THE USE OF THESE FUNDS TO PROVIDE THE CAPITAL NEEDS OF A PUBLIC BANK WILL TIE UP OUR LOCAL AGENCY FUNDS. LONGER THAN THE FIVE YEAR STATUTORY LIMIT. IT WOULD EXPOSE CAMPER FULL LIVES TO LARGER RISKS AND POTENTIAL LOSS OF PRINCIPAL. IT WOULD RENDER THESE FUNDS ON AVAILABLE PER MEDIA WITHDRAWAL BY A LOCAL AGENCY LESS THREATENING LOCAL AGENCIES BUDGETS AND OUR SERVICES TO OUR COMMUNITIES. RIGHT NOW WE'VE SEEN INCREASED PROPERTY TAX DELINQUENCIES AND WE WILL UNDOUBTEDLY SEE MORE AS WE PASSED THE DECEMBER TENTH DEADLINE. AND YET WE'RE IN A TIME WHERE CONSTITUENTS NEED MORE SERVICES SO MANY MORE SPEAKING MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH. AND PUBLIC ASSISTANCE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN YOUR LIFE. ONE MINUTE TREASURES. THANK YOU TURN AROUND THE STATE ARE SHIPPING THEIR PRIVILEGE TO INCREASE BUT TWENTY LIQUIDITY PREPARING FOR THE CASH FLOWS CHARGES THAT WE WILL NEED AND DEFINITELY SUFFERED THROUGH FORM YOU KNOW GETTING TO THIS PANDEMIC AND WILDFIRES. WE CANNOT AFFORD TO TIE UP OUR FUNDS. FOR LONG. TERM INVESTMENTS IN A PUBLIC BANK. IF THESE FUNDS WERE TO BE GRANTED FOR THIS USE THE LIKELY OUTCOME WILL BE THAT COUNTIES AND LOCAL AGENCIES WILL REMOVE THEIR DEPOSITS FROM LATE AND PMI. EIGHT FUNDS. IF THIS SHOULD OCCUR THE MONEY THAT A PUBLIC BANK IS NEEDED TO SUCCEED WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE AND THE EFFORTS WILL FAIL. IT IS IMPORTANT FOR PROPONENTS TO LOOK FOR FUNDING ELSEWHERE AND AFTER HEARING TESTIMONIES BY CONTROLLER D. AND TREVOR MOCK. THERE ARE SOME VIABLE ALTERNATIVES OUT THERE. WE KNOW PUBLIC BANKS PROVIDE WHERE THE SERVICES THE FINANCING CAPITAL PUBLICATIONS THE FUND IS NOT PRUDENT. ACT ACT IS NOT SUPPORTED IN THE CONCLUSION OF THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF MY MEMBERSHIP. WOULD SIMPLY MOVE THEIR MONEY OUT OF LIFE YOU MIGHT BE SHOULD BE SPENT TO BE SECURED FOR PUBLIC BANK. WE REQUIRE CAPITAL WE DO NOT PROVIDE CAPITAL. FOR THESE REASONS CHARACTER RESPECTFULLY OPPOSES THE USE OF FUNDS FROM LATE AND PMI WHICH IS COMPRISED OF STATE LOCAL GOVERNMENT DOLLARS TO PROVIDE THE FUNDING FOR CAPITAL BANK. IF I COULD JUST TAKING ONE MOMENT BEFORE I CONCLUDE TODAY I DID WANT TO THANK SENATOR MORLOCK FOR HIS WORK ON THIS COMMITTEE. A MUCH OF WHAT THE COUNTY TREASURERS AND TAX COLLECTORS DO IT'S HARD EVEN SOMETIMES TEDIOUS WORK AND COLLECTING TAXES DOESN'T ALWAYS MAKE US THE MOST POPULAR ELECTED OFFICIAL IN COUNTY GOVERNMENT. BUT THE WORK IS REALLY IMPORTANT IN WHAT WE DO IS IN THE SERVICE OF EVERY CALIFORNIANS. COUNTIES ARE IMPLEMENTING ARM OF SO MANY STATE PROGRAMS AND HAVE ANY FORMER COUNTY TREASURER SERVE IN THE SENATE ESPECIALLY ON YOUR COMMITTEE SENATOR MCGUIRE. WAS A STROKE OF LUCK FOR COUNTY TREASURE'S. KNOWING THAT A MEMBER OF YOUR COMMITTEE INTIMATELY UNDERSTOOD THE WORK WE DO AND HOW LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS WOULD WORK OR NOT WHEN IT CAME TIME TO IMPLEMENT THOSE PROPOSAL. THANK YOU SENATOR WIRE FOR INVITING US TO PARTICIPATE TODAY. THANK YOU SENATOR MORE LOCK FOR YOUR SERVICE THANK YOU FOR ALL OF YOUR TIME TO. THANK YOU SO MUCH MADAM PRESIDENT THAT'S TINA VERNON SHE IS PRESENT THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COUNTY TREASURERS AND TAX COLLECTORS- WITH THAT A VERY SPECIAL.

SO WE'RE NOW GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO CHAIR BRADFORD CHAIR BRADFORD HAS A QUESTION COMMENT THAT FOR THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE. I BELIEVE THAT CONTROLLER YOU MAY HAVE HAD TO ADJOURN HERSELF FOR ANOTHER MEETING BUT IF THAT'S THE CASE WE'RE GOING TO ASK BOTH THE LEAN IN INJURY TO PLEASE TURN ON THEIR CAMERAS. THAT TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE THERE WILL BE DANCE BY MISTER CHAIR CHAIR BRADFORD THE FLOOR'S YOURS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND I DID HAVE A QUESTION I APOLOGIZE REVIVAL ALLOWED TO CONTROLLER TO. LEAVE AND IT WAS REALLY ON- THE CDF. CITY OF VICE AND SHE GAVE A GREAT- PRESENTATION GIRL- THOROUGH INFORMATION IN REGARDS TO. THEM BEING A VIABLE ALTERNATIVE I GUESS MY QUESTION WOULD BE.

NEEDING ALTERNATIVE- ENTITY IN- A- OR FOR. INSTITUTIONS TO SERVE THESE CAN. SO WHY.

OUR THEY'RE SUPPORTED BY DID SOURCES INCLUDING MAINSTREAM THANKS OF THE WHAT I WOULD IS THE BANKS TO BE A SOURCE OF CAPITAL FOR CITY ADVISED BUT I THINK WE OUGHT NOT- JUST THEIR WAY FROM THE UNIQUE ATTRIBUTES OF CITY ADVISE US WAS SUCH AS PROVIDED BY ALL. OF NOTING RAMOS BUT THE- ENTERPRISE SON YOU KNOW IT'S REALLY WHAT'S MISSING IS THE EXPERTISE OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT WERE TRYING TO TARGET- IN THE TRADITIONAL BANKS ARE I MEAN I'VE ALSO GIVEN EXAMPLE- AT THE STOP OF SANTA OF THE STRUGGLING WITH BANKERS. BENCH I SEE THIS HAPPEN TO TIME TO TIME.

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN COMMITTEE WITH HEARD FROM THE VICE CHAIR WE'VE HEARD FROM THE CHAIR WE NOW WOULD LIKE TO BE A TO GO TO THOSE WHO ARE PARTICIPATING REMOTELY SAY GOOD MORNING ONCE AGAIN TO EACH OF THE SENATORS WOULD LIKELY TO SEE IF THEY'RE ANY SENATORS FOR THIS PANEL HAVE ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS OR CONCERNS IT THEY'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO ADVANCE. WILL GIVE YOU FOR A FEW MOMENTS TO BE ABLE TO RAISE YOUR HAND TO SEE IF THERE'S ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO BE A COMMENT- YOU YOU MAY HAVE HEARD ON THIS FINAL PANEL. IT'S GONNA BE FINAL CALL FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FOR PARTICIPATING SENATORS FINAL CALL FOR. PARTICIPATING SENATORS FROM EACH COMMITTEE. CENTER DRAWS OR DID YOU WANNA I CHIME IN ON THIS. YES ALL RIGHT IS YOUR MAN SENATOR. THANK YOU- I REALLY APPRECIATE ALL THE- PANELISTS- AND YOUR YOUR POINTS OF VIEW- HI IN THE NOTES OF THE COMMITTEE BACKGROUND THERE WAS- SORT OF THIS CHART OF THE MODELS ONE TWO AND THREE AND HOW MUCH MONEY AND- OVER HOW MANY YEARS IT WOULD TAKE TO BREAK EVEN- I WANT TO LOOK INTO THAT A LITTLE BIT MORE BUT- I WAS. HOPING THERE'D BE MORE OF THAT KIND O A BREAKDOWN OF WHAT IT WOULD TAKE A WHAT WOULD BE THERE'S A LOT THERE IS A LOT OF COMMENTS ABOUT THE RISK- THAT THE STATE WOULD BE TAKING AND OBVIOUSLY WE WANT TO LOOK AT THAT. BUT THAT WOULD SEEM SOMETHING MUCH MORE THAT WE SHOULD DIG IN. A LITTLE BIT MORE WHAT DO THOSE MEAN WHAT DO THOSE MODELS MAIN. AND IN ORDER FOR US TO. YOU KNOW CONSIDERED- IF THERE'S A RISK AND HOW MUCH OF A RISK BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THERE'S NOT MUCH OF A- F A COMPETITION HERE WITH- WITH THE BANKS AS FAR AS INVESTING IN OUR COMMUNITIES INVESTING IN THE ISSUES. THAT OUR COMMUNITIES ARE SUFFERING FROM BEING AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS AN EXTRAORDINARY CRISIS. HOMELESSNESS EXTRAORDINARY CRISIS AND YET WE CAN'T USE. SOMEHOW USE OUR FUNDS TO ASSIST IN SOLVING THAT CRISIS AT LEAST NOT ON THE LEVEL I SHOULD SAY NOT USING AT ALL AT LEAST NOT ON THE LEVEL THAT WE COULD BE AND THAT WE SHOULD BE I HAVEN'T HEARD ENOUGH ABOUT WHAT THOSE RISKS ARE OTHER THAN. A GENERAL WE'RE AT RISK OR AT RISK IT'S KIND OF LIKE SPOOKINESS AWAY FROM THE IDEA RATHER THAN DIGGING IN WHAT THE ISSUE AND LET'S SOLVE THAT ISSUE LET'S ADDRESS THAT ISSUE. WHAT WE CAN DO IT WE CAN'T DO IT IS TOO MANY OF THESE CAN'T DO. SO THAT'S JUST MISTER CHAIR MIGHT MY GENERAL- YOU KNOW- OUR RESPONSE. TO DISSENT BUT I DO APPRECIATE EVERYONE AND YOUR POINT OF VIEW THAT YOU CONTRIBUTED HERE AND. AND LASTLY AND MAYBE- ASSEMBLY MEMBER GALA COULD ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF THE- PM P. M. I. A.'S- BECAUSE THAT KEEPS COMING UP AND I THOUGHT THAT WASN'T INCLUDED IN THIS LEGISLATION SO MAYBE IN YOUR FINAL REMARKS COULD INCLUDE A REFERENCE TO THAT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU SO MUCH CENTER SENATOR ALSO WE ALWAYS APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS AND THANK YOU FOR PARTICIPATING NOT GONNA LOOK TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER SANTIAGO IF WE TAKE AT THE CENTER OFTEN MEET THEIR- ASSEMBLY MEMBER DO YOU WANT TO MAKE A COMMENT TO RESPOND TO WHAT AT CENTER DRAWS- JUST ASK YOU OR DO YOU WANT TO WAIT. FOR CLOSING COMMENTS IT'S UP TO YOU SIR. IN THE INTEREST OF COMMITTEES TIME I COULD WAIT TILL CLOSING COMMENTS. OKAY ESCRITOR INET WE LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING THAT RESPONSE FROM ASSEMBLYMEMBER SANTIAGO TO SENATOR RUSSELL HERE. IN HIS CLOSING COMMENTS I DON'T NEED TO KEEP LOOKING TO MY LEFT I JUST WANNA I'M LOOKING AT THE SCREEN HERE I DON'T MEAN TO. THAT LOOK STRAIGHT AHEAD BUT I WANTED TO SEE IF THERE IS ANYONE ELSE ANYONE ELSE ANY SENATORS. WHO WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO ASK QUESTIONS. COMMENT HAVE A COMMON. CONCERN ALL RIGHT LET'S GO TO CENTER CABALLERO. GOOD MORNING CENTER CABALLERO. THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MA'AM MISTER CHAIR I APPRECIATE IT- LET ME JUST SAY THAT THAT- THAT REALLY APPRECIATE ALL OF THAT OF THE TESTIMONY- IN IT YET- WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE IT. THAT- THAT THERE IS THERE IS THAT THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO- TO CREATE. RESOURCES THAT WILL HELP- AND MAKE THE MAJOR INVESTMENTS THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IN A COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND- AND FINANCIALLY STRUGGLING COMMUNITIES AND- IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT THIS PANDEMIC HAS MAGNIFIED THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THOSE AT THAT HAPPENED THOSE THAT HAVE NOT AND- pSUFFERING THE HIGHEST INFECTION RATES ARE THOSE THAT HAVE NOT AND FOR A WHOLE VARIETY OF REASONS- BUT- KNOW. WHAT I HEARD HERE TODAY IS I GUESS THIS IS JUST A SUMMARY IS THAT WE'VE WE'VE SET UP SOME. SOME OPPORTUNITIES FOR SOME MUNICIPAL BANKS. AND IT IT'S AN EXPERIMENT REALLY TO SEE WHETHER ANY ANY OF THESE- ENTITIES ACTUALLY. BECOME REALITY WHETHER THERE'S AN INTEREST IN INVESTING IN- THE INFRASTRUCTURE NECESSARY TO BE ABLE TO PUT ONE OF THESE TOGETHER AND- AND LET'S BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT IT IT'S CITY INTENDING INCREDIBLY HUGE INVESTMENT. OF TIME AND RESOURCES IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO. CREATE AN ENTITY THAT HAS THE OP THAT THAT HAS THAT THAT THE WHERE WITH ALL TO BE ABLE TO DO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE THINK ARE IMPORTANT FOR OUR COMMUNITY WHETHER IT'S- FINANCIAL LITERACY WHETHER IT'S LOW INTEREST LOANS WHETHER IT'S SMALL BUSINESS LOANS- IT. IT'S AN INVESTMENT AND IT'S GOING TO COST AND- WHAT I THINK I HEARD TODAY IT LEAST FROM FROM THE PARTNER WELL AND THEN IF WE DO THIS IT'S GONNA BE A PARTNERSHIP WITH A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT- ENTITIES WHETHER THEY BE BANKS OR CREDIT UNIONS AND THEN CITIES AND COUNTIES. AND- AND SO THAT'S THE FRAMEWORK THAT WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THIS WORK IN AND THEN- AND THEN THE FINANCIAL PART OF BEING A CITY COUNCIL MEMBER HAVING BEEN A CITY COUNCIL MEMBER FOR FIFTEEN YEARS- IS IT YOU WANT TO PUT YOUR MONEY IN A PLACE. WHERE YOU KNOW YOU CAN YOU HAVE THE LIQUIDITY YOU KNOW YOU HAVE THAT THE RESOURCES AT YOUR FINGERTIPS WHEN IT COMES TIME TO MAKE. THE PAYMENTS THAT ARE REQUIRED OF YOU AND THAT YOU KNOW- IT CAN BE IT. PHYSICALLY VERY SOUND EASY YOU'LL HAVE THAT RESPONSIBILITY. AND YOU HAVE TO ASCERTAIN THAT IN SO WHEN I HEARD IN TERMS OF THE STAKEHOLDERS IS THAT THERE ARE SOME REAL CONCERNS WITH THAT THE STATE INCLUDING OUR OWN- TREASURER AND CONTROLLER. IT IS WADING INTO THIS AREA WHEN THERE MAY BE SOME OTHER ALTERNATIVES. THAT MAKE MORE- SENSE AND THEN DON'T. PUT US AT AT SUCH A RISK ARE REALLY A- THAT BECAUSE I I'M LOOK FOR SOMEONE I DON'T WANT. I'M A LIKE CENTER DERIVES RIGHT I DON'T WANT TO JUST YOU'RE RIGHT YOU CAN'T DO YOU CAN'T DO IT YOU CAN'T DO IT AT THAT HAVE TO BE SOME ALTERNATIVES- AND I DO APPRECIATE. WHAT CONTROLLER HE HAD TO SAY WHICH IS THAT. MAYBE IT'S TIME FOR ALL OF OUR CAUCUSES TO GET TOGETHER AND TO SAY WE WANT TO ANY INVESTMENT WHETHER IT'S CRA OR CDFI INVESTMENT. TO BE. RESPONSIVE TO OUR NEEDS IN OUR COMMUNITY TO BE VERY SPECIFIC ABOUT WHAT OUR EXPECTATIONS ARE. AND AND GO ANY IMMUNITY TO REALLY PROCESO ANYWAY THAT'S I'M I REALLY APPRECIATE THIS HEARING BECAUSE I THINK IT'S HELPED TO CRYSTALLIZE IN MY- IN MY HEAD SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT- THAT ARE ARE WE DID WE NEED TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION IF WE'RE GOING TO TAKE. THIS STEP TO MAKE A MAJOR INVESTMENT LIKE THIS SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU SO MUCH SIS CENTER CABALLERO GRATEFUL FOR THOSE COMMENTS.

SURE THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND IN INDIA TIME BE AS BRIEF AS- ENTRY DOWN MY THIRTY. CLOSE OUR- A COUPLE OF MINUTES HERE WE GO THANK YOU VERY MUCH BUT BUT I WANT TO SET THE STAGE AND THANK A HOAX. WHO ARE ON HERE BOTH PARTICIPANTS ALL OF OUR PANELISTS. FOR AND THE IN A HOUSING THOUGHTS ON THE ISSUE THESTATE PUBLIC BANK BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS WORKS. YOU KNOW WE STARTED OFF WITH DOING THIS WILL BANKS ARE THOSE A LOT OF QUESTIONS AND ULTIMATELY WE GOT- WE GOT FIRST IN THE NATION TO ALLOW LOCALIST. TO SETTLE DOUBLET BANK I WANNA MOST REST OF LAWS WAS ABLE. TO OCCUR BECAUSE WE HAD ROBUST. CONVERSATION TO THE LEGISLATURE- AND- I WANT TO START OFF BY SAYING THAT. WHAT WE'RE DEBATING BEFORE US IS THE CREATION OF THE STATE PUBLIC BANK- WE DID HAVE LEGISLATION. LAST SESSION AND I WANT TO ECHO THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS WORKS WERE WE- BUT WE DECIDED TO CONTINUE IT- BUT LET ME ALSO MAKE SOMETHING CLEAR THAT IAN D. PROPOSALS THAT WE'RE MOVING FORWARD- WE DON'T TALK ABOUT USING A P. I AM A- FUNDS. SO I'M JUST CORRECT THAT AND I THINK WE'VE BEEN. PRETTY CLEAR IF THERE WAS ANY DOUBT WHEN YOU SAY THAT. THERE SHOULD BE SOME OF THE TABLE GOES. ARGUMENT SUPPORT OF THE SITE. AND THAT'S PARTLY BECAUSE THE LEGISLATIVE. WHERE AND WE HEARD- THE- YOU CAN ABOUT USING THE FUNDS ARE NOT NOT HAVING SAY THAT- WE WILL INTO ACCOUNT. OF THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE ON DURING THIS HEARING AND IT'S AN CORPS INPUT INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT HE DID ALSO HERE- ABOUT THE RIGOROUS PROCESS IN THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK THAT WAS CREATED. IN EIGHTY EIGHT FIVE SEVEN EIGHT WHICH MADE IT A VERY SERIOUS CLLS PROPOSAL NOTHING DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING FOR STATE PUBLIC BANK THIS ISN'T. AN IDEA OUT OF THIN AIR THIS IS A SERIOUS POLICY PROPOSAL- THAT WILL HAVE A FREE MARKET REGULATORY FRAMEWORK THAT WILL HELP TO PREVENT A RISK NO DIFFERENT THAN AND THEN ANY OTHER. BANKING ENTITY ARE AVAILABLE AND LET'S JUST FACE IT NEEDED THE D. CURRENT BANKING SYSTEM IS BROKEN. WE SEEN GREAT WORK FROM. CREDIT UNIONS WE SEEM WORKS- TO ME BANK- BUT WE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT IN A GREATER SCALE ALSO WE SEE. WE SEE THE ABILITY OF THE STATE PUBLIC BANK. DURING UP WITH YOUR WITH A CD- ADVISE AT A LOCAL LEVEL ARE WE SEEING. THE POSSIBILITY ARE YOU CAN EVEN ENVISION A SCENARIO WHERE. AIRBAGS ALWAYS IN THE FUTURE HOUSE- AND LEVERAGE WITH COMMUNITY BANKS AND CREDIT UNIONS TO DO MORE LOCAL LENDING TO SMALL BUSINESSES AND I THINK IT'S YOUR IT IF WE WERE TO TALK TO SMALL BUSINESS. THERE'S A LOT OF LACK AND A LOT OF WANT IN TERMS OF NEEDS- THAT WEREN'T AVAILABLE TO HIM TO BIG BANKS. I MEAN THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE- AND AT THE END OF THE DAY I THINK THERE ARE BETTER USES. OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS ARE BETTER USES OF OUR STATE- DOLLARS. WHEN IT COMES TO HELPING SMALL BUSINESSES WHEN IT COMES TO HELPING- SMALL FARMERS WHEN IT COMES TO HELPING TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING. OR JUST HELPING US OUT OF THIS PANDEMIC OR OR EVEN DURING A NON PANDEMIC TONS I THINK THERE'S NEEDS TO BE A REIMAGINING. OF HOW WE DOING ANY BANKING SYSTEM SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING THAT CONVERSATION. AS WE CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD I KNOW THAT WAS A COUPLE OF THE TREASURES WERE CLOSE BUT BUT CERTAINLY THERE WAS TREASURES LIKE THE ONES IN MY OWN BACKYARD OTHER AREAS OF CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE VERY SUPPORTIVE. OF A PUBLIC BANKS- AND IT MAKES ABSOLUTE SENSE TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS IT. MAKES SENSE IT ABSOLUTELY MAKES SENSE. EIGHT A BANKING SYSTEM. THAT THAT PUTS PEOPLE'S. IN OUR COMMUNITY NEEDS ARE SMALL BUSINESS NEEDS ARE GOOD CULTURAL NEEDS. BEFORE THE NEEDS OF PROFITS AND STAKEHOLDERS. AND I THINK THAT WE HAVE A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE THAT HERE. CALIFORNIA AND WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS INCREMENTAL CHANGE TO CREATE THAT THAT PUBLIC STATE BANK. AND WE HAVE A GOOD RAMEWORK FOR IT. D. I. BANK IS DONE GOOD WORK I THINK YOU COULD DO BETTER WORK IF IT WERE TO BE CALIFORNIA'S. A STATE PUBLIC BANKS. ARE AND I AND I WOULD CHALLENGE- FOLKS WHO MAY BE. A LITTLE BIT CAUTIOUS ABOUT CREATING THE STATE PUBLIC BANK. THAT THAT I'M APPRECIATIVE OF THE REASONS WHY WE CAN'T DO IT BUT WE IMAGINE THAT WE COULD DO IT. AND TELL US WHAT IT IS. I HAVE IN THE PAST TO GETTING THERE. BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S GREAT POTENTIAL AND HAVING. A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- SOLE AND PRIMARY GOAL. BESIDES BEING FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBLE BESIDES MAKING SURE THAT PENCILS OUT BESIDES ALL THOSE THINGS THAT WE WOULD EXPECT FROM ANY BANK- AND GOOD REGULATORY FRAMEWORK TO ENSURE. THAT THAT ANY THE CONCERNS. ARE BLOOD EITHER RISK OR OTHERWISE THAT WE HAVE THE BANKING SYSTEM. THAT PRIORITIZES THE WELLBEING OF CALIFORNIANS IN IN CALIFORNIA'S OUR ECONOMIC SYSTEM AND I THINK THERE'S A REAL POSSIBILITY HERE. YOU KNOW WILL TAKE. ALL COMMENTS ALL CONCERNS WHAT WILL TREAT HIM BALLOT- BUT AGAIN I WANT TO SAY TO MR- TO THE CHAIRS BUT MISTER BRADFORD. MISTER MCGUIRE AND THE TREASURER AND THE CONTROLLER AND- ALL THE ADVOCATES FOR AND AGAINST. OTHER PARTICIPATED IN THOSE IN BETWEEN. OUR THAT WE WANT TO CREATE A SERIES POLICY PROPOSAL- THAT ADDRESSES A LOT OF THE A LOT OF WHAT'S LACKING IN CALIFORNIA'S. A BANKING SYSTEM AND WILL TAKE EVERY COMMENT SERIOUS WE'RE GOING TO WORK TOWARDS IT. UP I THINK IT'S TIME IS COME WELL WE'VE NOW SEEN. OUR PROPOSALS AT THE NATIONAL. LEVEL- FROM I PRESENTS A NEW YOUR IN OTHERWISE I- ARE LOOKING TOWARDS CHIU ASSIST OR SINGLE. ON ACROSS THE- AT THINK IT'S A NUMBER THAT. LEADS WITH THE SOLID. OTHER HEALTH SYSTEM THIS A STATE. BANK THAT CAN WORK- SO THE WORK OF COMMUNITY BANKS YOU- INCREASE AND HELPS CREATE A SUPPORT THE WORK. OF FUTURE A MUNICIPAL PUBLIC BANKS SO WITH THAT IN MIND I WANT TO THANK. ALL THE SENATORS WHO PARTICIPATED IN SOME PRESIDENTE- AND A LOT OF WAYS. OTHER SENATE COMMITTEES WILL COME TOGETHER TO HOLD A HEARING ON AN ISSUE NOT A BILL I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT THAT SO. WE HEARD EVERYBODY VERY LOUD AND CLEAR ABOUT P. M. EIGHTY OF- BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE TODAY SO I JUST WANNA SAY THAT AGAIN AN EMPHASIS- INDUSTRY JOURNALISM ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS MISTER CHAIRS IF YOU HAVE ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS ANY- I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR. YOUR ROBUST PARTICIPATION AND- INCLUDE YOU AND ALL OTHERS WHO HAVE BEEN ON THIS- CALLED- MR CHU HOW WHITE NOT GIVEN ENOUGH THANKS TO- AND ALSO THE CONTROL IN THE TREASURE OF ALL. MISTER BRADFORD OF ALL PARTNERS. IN CREATING A FRAMEWORK FOR A CALIFORNIA STATE PUBLIC BANK- THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND HI I APPRECIATE YOUR HARD WORK THINK. SIMILAR THANK YOU FOR YOUR PARTNERSHIP ENDED THIS IS CRITICAL WE MADE A COMMITMENT TO THE SIMILAR MEMBERS SOMEONE OVER SANTIAGO SIMILAR TO- EARLY IN THE FALL THAT WE WOULD. FOLLOW UP ON THIS HEARING IT WAS CRITICAL TO THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS TO. THE COALITION IS SUPPORTING THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE IS WELL I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER SANTIAGO INNOCENT MEMBER TO HAVE BEEN NOTHING. BUT GENTLEMAN OF THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS COLLABORATIVE AS WELL WE GREATLY APPRECIATE THEIR PARTNERSHIP. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF COMMITTEE WE'RE GONNA TURN OVER THE VICE CHAIR FOR CLOSING COMMENTS THEN WE'RE GONNA FINISH IT UP WITH YOUR BRADFORD. MISTER VICE CHAIR PLEASE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST WANTED. TO MAKE A COUPLE OF CARS- OBSERVATIONS ONE WAS WHAT- COMMENT I WROTE. DOWN LISTENING TO THE PUBLIC. PROPERTY SHOULD NOT BE THE MAIN. YET THAT'S THEM THE FREEMEN UNDERPINNING. A RISK TAKER DO SO FOR PROP. AND PAY AND TAX ACCORDINGLY. AND I'M CONCERNED- AS A LEAD. THAT THE STATE HAS A STYLE DRAFT THAT THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT HAVE TO. TO DO EVERYTHING THAT WOULD ADDRESS A PERCEIVED NEED AND SO WE SHOULD PROCEED WITH CAUTION. IF IT BANKS ARE VILLAINS WHICH HAS BEEN STATED A FEW TIMES THEN REGULATORS WHICH ARE GOVERNMENT ARM. MAY BE A PART OF THE PROBLEM MAYBE THAT NEEDS TO BE RE EVALUATED. SO MY- FAREWELL RECOMMENDATION WOULD BE THAT. THE STATE CAPITOL SHOULD STICK TO THE CORE BUSINESS OF GOVERNMENT. WITH THAT MISTER JR. CALIFORNIA HAS A GLORIOUS HISTORY OF BANKING. A HARRIS NEWMARK OF. STORE OWNER IN LOS ANGELES- WE HAD THE ONLY SAFE IN TOWN YOU IMPACT THE TREASURE TAX COLLECTOR FOR L. A. COUNTY USED IS SAFE- AND HIS NEPHEW CASPER CONE WOULD BE THE SECURITY SYSTEM- HE SLEPT ON THE FIRST FLOOR OF THE STORE AND WATCH DISABLED I. HUNG BUT HE WOULD FOUNDER BANK HIMSELF WE KNOW IT TODAY IS UNION BANK N. I'D SAY IT'S W. HELLMAN- A WONDERFUL LOS ANGELES IMMIGRANT IS WELL FOUNDED FARMERS AND MERCHANTS BANK THE FIRST ORIGINAL AND THEN HE WENT OFF TO GO TO SAN FRANCISCO TO BE THE PRESIDENT OF WELLS FARGO AT THAT TIME IN THE EIGHTIES LATE EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS OF WE HAVE A GLORIOUS HISTORY AND AS A CALIFORNIA HISTORY BUFF I JUST WANT TO.

THANK YOU CHAIRMAN WATER AND I APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORT IN PUTTING THE SHARING TOGETHER- DURING HEARING OF GOVERNANCE. AND FINANCE AND- BANKING AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS I THINK IF THERE'S ONE TAKEAWAY. WILL LEAVE WITH TODAY'S. THAT THERE IS A NEED. THAT IS CLEARLY BEEN ARTICULATED THAT THERE IS A NEED THE ONLY ISSUE IS. WHAT METHOD AND HOW DO WE GO ABOUT. FILLING THAT NEED OR SERVING THAT NEED. BUT THE NEW CLEARLY EXIST. AND I TO HAVE CONCERNED JAZZ TO THE ROLE THAT THE STATE CONTINUES TO PLAY AND AREAS THAT. SHOULD BE HANDLED BY OUR- YOU KNOW PRIVATE ENTITIES BUT MANY OF OUR PRIVATE ENTITIES ARE FAILING US AND THEN THAT'S WHY THE GOVERNMENT HOUSE TO FILL THE LARGER THE GAP AND STEP IN WHEN OUR PRIVATE INDUSTRIES DON'T DO THEIR PART- HI. HOPE THAT OUR BANKS ARE LISTENING- AND I IN HERE THAT THERE IS A LARGE POPULATION THAT IS NOT BEING SERVED THERE EITHER UNBANKED OR UNDERBANKED AND WE HAVE THESE DISCUSSIONS AGAIN BECAUSE THERE IS A POPULATION OUT THERE THAT NEED TO RESOURCES THAT THEY CAN ACCESS TO. TRADITIONAL CHANNELS AND- WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY T SERVE THAT POPULATION- REGARDLESS OF WHO THEY ARE AND NOW THERE IS A NEED AND I DID A BILL A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO- TRYING TO CREATE A BANKING DISTRICTS AS TERMS OF THE WHAT THEY WERE DOING IN NEW YORK. BECAUSE AGAIN WE SAW THE RIFTING THREE MILLION CALIFORNIANS THAT HAVE NO BANK ACCOUNT AND- AGAIN SO. WELL IT'S TO A PUBLIC BANKING SYSTEM. WHETHER IT'S THROUGH THE AYE BANK WHETHER IT'S FROM CEDIA ALFIE'S- I THINK THE STATE DOES HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY HERE. AND I THINK WE'VE- HEARD THE MARCHING ORDERS FROM MANY INDIVIDUALS AND WE WANT TO THANK ALL THE PANELISTS FOR THEIR GREAT INFORMATION OUR TREASURE OUR CONTROLLER WHO. RAISED A LOT OF CONCERNS BUT ALSO PROVIDED A LOT OF GOOD SUGGESTIONS AS TO HOW WE ADDRESS THIS ISSUE- BUT I THINK WE KNOW THAT THERE'S STILL MUCH WORK TO BE DONE IN THIS AREA I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE SENATOR MORE LOT FOR.
