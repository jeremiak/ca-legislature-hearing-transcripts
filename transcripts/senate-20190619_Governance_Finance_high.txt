SIX THIRTY TWO AGAIN MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS -- THIS IS AB SIX THIRTY TWO ALLOWS LAKECOUNTY TO CONSOLIDATE THE ELECTED OFFICES OF AUDITOR CONTROLLER AND THE TREASURER TAX COLLECTOR. MANY OF YOU KNOW LIKE IT IS A RURAL COUNTY AND MY DISTRICT THAT HAS BEEN DID IT HAS BEEN DEVASTATED IN RECENT FIRES AND FACING. EDIBLE FINANCIAL CHALLENGES. ASA PART OF THE FISCAL CRISIS MANAGEMENT PLAN LAKE COUNTY PROPOSE COMBINING THE COUNTY AUDITOR CONTROLLER. AND THE COUNTY TAX A TREASURE TAX COLLECTORS OFFICES. FIVE OTHER COUNTIES HAVE TO HAVE THIS AUTHORITY COMBINE THESE TWO ELECTED OFFICES CAN LEAD TO GREATER EFFICIENCY AND COLLABORATION WALK CUTTING DOWN THE COUNTY COSTS. SB SIX THIRTY TO SIMPLY GIVES LAKE COUNTY ANOTHER TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX TO HELP THEM GET BACK ON THEIR FEET. I ASK FOR YOUR IBM BY VOTE AND WITH ME TODAY IS MATT MATTHEW WROTE ROTHSTEIN ON BEHALF OF LAKE COUNTY. THANK YOU SO MUCH MEDICINE WOMAN PLEASE SIR GOOD TO SEE. OUR FIRST ONE IS A SENATOR MCGUIRE AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER AGUILAR CURRY -- YOUR SUPPORT OF LAKE COUNTY AND SOME OF OUR DARKEST HOURS AS WE FACE WILD FIRE AND FLOOD. AND YOUR ONGOING WORK ON BEHALF OF LEE COUNTY RESIDENTS AND OTHER CONNECTED INDIVIDUALS IS TRULY EXTRAORDINARY. I WILL JUST TAKE A MOMENT TO KNOWLEDGE AT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT WORK YOU'RE THE ONES I'VE BEEN WORK IN YOUR TAILS OFF CANDIDLY SO VERY GRATEFUL. AND AS THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M DEEPLY GRATEFUL FOR YOUR TIME THIS MORNING ON BEHALF OF LAKE COUNTY THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. AS YOUR COMMITTEE IS AWARE OF LAKE COUNTY'S GOVERNMENT IS FACING NUMEROUS AND COMPETING FINANCIAL CHALLENGES AND ON DECEMBER FOR TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN OR BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. ADOPTED A FISCAL CRISIS MANAGEMENT PLAN. YOU'RE PROBABLY ALSO WHERE THAT LAKE COUNTY HAS NO IMMEDIATE PLANS TO CONSOLIDATE OUR FINANCIAL OFFICES WITH RECENT ELECTIONS HAVING ESTABLISHED BOTH OFFICES LEADERSHIP FOR THE NEXT FOUR YEARS. HOWEVER SEEKING THE FLEXIBILITY TO CONSOLIDATE OFFICES IS CONSISTENT WITH MULTIPLE PRIORITIES AND FISCAL CRISIS MANAGEMENT PLAN. AND THAT'S WHY I'M HERE BEFORE YOUR COMMITTEE TODAY. IN LAKE COUNTY WE'RE IN A TIME OF CONSIDERABLE TRANSITION AND EXPLORING MANY PATHWAYS TO MAKE OUR ORGANIZATION MORE FLEXIBLE TO MEET EMERGING OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES. AND IN PREPARING FOR THE FUTURE WE HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE. AND PLAN IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FACT THAT MAINTAINING APPROPRIATE STAFFING IN OUR PHYSICAL FUNCTIONS HAS BEEN AN AREA OF LONG TERM AN INTENSIFYING CONCERN. MULTIPLE RECENT RECRUITMENT FOR HIGH LEVEL FISCAL STAFF HAVE BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL. AND OTHER POSITIONS HAVE BEEN UNDER FILLED WHICH OF INCREASE THE TRAINING NEEDS OF ALREADY OVERBURDENED DEPARTMENTS -- ONE OF THE REALITIES WE FACE IS THAT HAVE A COLLEGE DEGREE IN ANY SUBJECT. THE POOL WITH A SIGNIFICANT FISCAL BACKGROUND IS CONSIDERABLY SMALLER. AS AN ATTRACTING HIGH PERFORMERS FROM OTHER GEOGRAPHIC AREAS HAS LIKEWISE BEEN DIFFICULT. AJUDAR RELATIVE ISOLATION AND LAGGING EMPLOYEE SALARIES AND BENEFITS. ELECTED OFFICIALS FURTHER NEED TO MAKE THE CHOICE TO LIVE IN LAKE COUNTY AND WE'VE BEEN UNABLE TO CONSISTENTLY ATTRACT DEPUTY LEVEL STAFF. THEY CAN ESTABLISH ROOTS AND GROWING TO OUR NEXT GENERATION OF ELECTED OFFICERS. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN LAKE COUNTY'S AUDITOR CONTROLLER ASSESSOR RECORDER AND TREASURER TAX COLLECTOR. ALL RAN UNOPPOSED. IN FACT PER OUR REGISTRAR OF VOTERS OFFICE THERE HASN'T BEEN A CONTESTED ELECTION FOR ONE OF THESE POSITIONS IN THREE DECADES. SO AS YOU CAN APPRECIATE CREATING THE FLEXIBILITY TO CONSOLIDATE OUR FINANCIAL OFFICES AT A FUTURE DATE JUST MAKES SENSE FOR LAKE COUNTY. SO -- WERE ALSO I WANNA BEEN ASSURE YOU THAT WE'RE AWARE THAT -- ADDRESSING CHECKS AND BALANCES SHOULD BE MOVED TO CONSOLIDATE THESE OFFICES IS VERY IMPORTANT. AND WERE OPEN TO EXPLORING MODELS THAT OTHER COUNTIES ARE PURSUED AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL SUPPORT OF MECHANISM SUCH AS STRONG TREASURY OVERSIGHT AND AUDIT COMMITTEES AND WORKING GROUPS. AND ALSO LIAISON POSITIONS WITH STAFF WORKING OUTSIDE OF ANY OF THOSE OFFICES DIRECT CHAIN OF COMMAND AND ABLE TO READILY RAISE ISSUES THAT COME TO THERE WERE IN THIS WITHOUT FEAR OF DISCIPLINARY ACTION -- WE RECENTLY DEVELOPED A TAX ADMINISTRATOR POSITION THAT DOES JUST THAT AND HAS ENHANCE THE WORKING RELATIONSHIP OF OUR OF BOTH ADMINISTRATION AND THE TREASURE TAX COLLECTOR'S OFFICE. TODAY I ASK THAT YOU SUPPORT AB. SIX THIRTY TWO AS YOU CAN UNDOUBTEDLY APPRECIATE. THIS IS ABOUT MORE THAN JUST FINANCES.% THE FLEXIBILITY THE A. B. SIX THIRTY TWO OFFERS IS RIGHT FOR LAKE COUNTY. NOW AND IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TIME THANK YOU SO MUCH AND TO KEEP YOUR COMMENTS ARE VERY GRATEFUL FOR EVEN HERE TODAY SIR PLEASE GIVE OUR BEST A SUCH AS SOON AS WELL AS SPECIAL BOARD. WE LIKE WE ARE OPEN IT UP TO THOSE WHO MAY BE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL IF YOU COULD PLEASE ADVANCE AT THIS TIME. LOOKING FOR THOSE WHO MAY BE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL.

MAGNA BASS THE WITNESSES AT ACADEMY. HAVE YOU DISCUSSED MERGING WITH THE NEIGHBORING COUNTY OR COUNTIES. MERGING WITH A NEIGHBORING COUNTY. A NO WE HAVE NOT THIS TIME. ARM JUST ONE S. R.. IN MY PREVIOUS LIFE I WAS A COUNTY TREASURER TAX COLLECTOR AND I'VE. I'VE HAD DIFFICULTY WITH MERGING THE OFFICES -- BUT I I TAKE IT WHEN IT'S DONE IT SHOULD BE DONE THROUGH A BALLOT SO IF YOU SEE ME VOTING NO. IT'S JUST BECAUSE I'VE GOT. THESE OLD IDEAS STILL STUCK IN MY HEAD AND THAT'S THE COURSE I THINK THIS IS THE MOST APPROPRIATE [inaudible] AND SO. LOOKING PAST ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES I'M JUST. FOCUSED ON THAT ON THAT -- PRINCIPLE. THANK YOU MISTER THANK YOU SO MUCH AS A VICE CHAIR I HAVE SOME QUICK CLOSING COMMENTS. BUT I WOULD LIKE TO GO TO SEE IF WE HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS.

MADAM SOME NUMBER WOULD LIKE TO SEE IF YOU LIKE TO BE A CLOSE AND WILL ASK FOR A MOTION TO APPRECIATE ALL YOUR WORK ON THIS ISSUE -- QUITE FRANKLY I I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENT -- SENATOR BECAUSE YEAH WHEN TO BE GREAT TO CONSOLIDATE.

TRYING TO FIND PEOPLE THAT WANT TO LIVE IN A RURAL DISTRICT. THE PERSON MAY ONE OVER THE FAMILY MAY NOT WANT TO STAY VERY LONG SO THAT WE WE SHUFFLE THROUGH QUITE A FEW PEOPLE IN IN OUR REAL COMMUNITIES -- AND IT'S FRUSTRATING -- IT'S NOT.

THE JOBS ARE NOT THERE WERE TRYING TO BRING BACK ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WE'RE TRYING TO DO ALL THESE THINGS FOR THE COUNTY.

DIRECTLY TO THAT HOME WHERE THAT CUSTOMERS A LIGHT OUTLETS APPLIANCES AND OTHER LOADS. IS SET TO EXPIRE IN JANUARY OF NEXT YEAR. AB TWELVE AWAY WOULD EXTEND THAT EXEMPTION TO JANUARY. TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN WHEN-CALIFORNIANS GENERATE CLEAN ENERGY SAFELY ON THEIR OWN ROOF FOR ON THEIR ON PREMISES THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO USE THAT ENERGY. THAT CLEAN ENERGY WITHOUT OBSTRUCTION INTERFERENCE OR TAX FROM THE GOVERNMENT. THE STATE AS YOU KNOW HAS AMBITIOUS GOALS TO TACKLE CLIMATE CHANGE AND WE SHOULD BE INCENTIVIZE IN ALL CALIFORNIANS TO USE RENEWABLE ENERGY. NOT PUTTING UP COSTS BEAR YEARS BY TAXING THEM.

IF YOU WANT TO JOIN US HERE OF THE DICE. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THE FLOOR IS YOURS ON AB TROUBLING THANK YOU GOOD MORNING CARA ROSS ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF PASADENA. OUR OPPOSITION TO THIS REALLY HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH RENEWABLE ENERGY THIS IS ABOUT THE EXTENSION ON THE UT WE OPPOSED IT WHEN IT WAS FIRST ESTABLISHED IN. TWENTY THIRTEEN WE CONTINUE TO OPPOSE THE DECISION BY THE LEGISLATURE TO OVER RIDE OUT OF A LOCAL AGENCY WHERE OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT. IN PASADENA THE VOTERS APPROVED THIS TAX THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE RELY ON IT SO WE BELIEVE THAT IT'S HARD TO SHOULD BE AT OUR DISCRETION WHETHER OR NOT. AND HOW THIS TAX IMPOSED AND FOR THAT REASON WE WOULD OPPOSE THE EXTENSION OF THE BILL OR THE EXTENT OF THE TAX AND THERE BY THE BILL ITSELF. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU FOR YOUR AT WORDS TODAY WE NOW WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO SEE IF THERE'S ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION OF THE BILL. IF YOU COULD PLEASE COME TO THIS MICROPHONE THIS TIME LOOKING FOR THOSE FOR OPPOSE. LAST CALL. WE'D LIKE TO BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE FOR CONVERSATION MISTER VICE CHAIR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. TO MAINTAIN DO WE KNOW WHAT DOLLAR AMOUNT OF LOST REVENUES WERE TALKING ABOUT THAT'S A QUESTION. I DO NOT BECAUSE SEVERAL. THE CITY OF PASADENA KNOW WHAT. TO WHAT DOLLAR AMOUNT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. IF YOU DON'T MIND JOINT IS BACK UP THE DICE PLEASE. AND IF YOU DON'T MIND JUST REDUCING YOURSELF AS WELL THE QUESTION IS. THE DOLLAR AMOUNT LAS. WE DON'T KNOW THE DOLLAR AMOUNT ON MY JUST REDUCE HIM SORRY I'M SORRY CARE ROSS AGAIN ON BEHALF THE CITY OF PASSING IT WE DON'T HAVE AN EXACT DOLLAR FIGURE I DON'T BELIEVE THIS IS COULD CURRENTLY COLLECTED. SO IT'S SOMETHING WHERE WE'RE LOOKING AT IT LONG TERM -- I DO KNOW FROM THE CITY OF PASADENA STANDPOINT WE COLLECT I BELIEVE IT'S ABOUT TWENTY FOUR DOLLARS PER -- PER PER HOME UP HEALTH HOLD ON IN FOR OUR TOTAL YOU UT SO THIS WOULD BE ONE SMALL FRACTION. AND IT'S A THIS JUST APPLIES TO THOSE THAT ARE. HAVING A SOLAR PANELS FOR FOR SOMEONE ELSE NOT NECESSARILY JUST FOR YOURSELF RESERVE FOR EVERYBODY WAS SOLD [inaudible] IT. VISIT WHERE YOU'RE JUST TALKING ABOUT THE ELECTRONS THAT GO FROM THE FROM YOUR PANELS DIRECTLY INTO YOUR OUTLETS IF I'M SO IF YOU HAVE SOLAR PANELS ON YOUR ROOF YOU WILL STILL. BE PAYING A TAX ON THE ELECTRICITY YOU TAKE FROM THE GRANT. OKAY DOES THAT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION YOU KNOW THE SIZE I I I THOUGHT THAT IT WAS -- A UNIQUE -- THAT IT WOULD THAT IT WAS FOR PROJECTS TO A MORE DIFFERENT THAN JUST SOLAR PANELS. SO I APOLOGIZE FOR MISTER STATE I THOUGHT THE RELATIVE AMOUNT WOULD BE RATHER DE MINIMUS. BUT I APPRECIATE THE LOCAL CONTROL ISSUE [inaudible] SO I'M. TRYING TO YOU KNOW IF IT'S A DIMINISH MISS AMOUNT THAT I DON'T KNOW WHY WERE HAGGLING BUT IN A LITTLE BIT BUT I GUESS I GUESS I'D LOVE TO SEE A QUANTIFIED. IN A IN NOT AT ALL GOING TO BE ABLE TO NAIL DOWN A SPECIFIC BUT BASED OFF OF COMMITTEE ANALYSIS WE BELIEVE IT'S A USED THE TERM NEGLIGIBLE ACROSS THE STATE IN REGARDS. TO LOSSES FOR MUNICIPALITIES -- BUT CAN'T NAIL THAT DOWN BUT IT IS [inaudible] VERY SMALL. IN AND I WOULD JUST ADD THAT WE THINK THIS IS A VERY SMALL. INCENTIVE TO WORK AGAIN ENCOURAGE CLEAN ENERGY WE HAVE -- GOALS THAT WE'VE ALREADY PUT INTO LAW TO TRY TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE. GAS EMISSIONS WE THINK THIS IS A OF GET UP ON THE L. AWAITED DO IT -- WITHOUT HAVING A VERY SIGNIFICANT FISCAL IMPACT. I WOULD JUST ADD OUR OPPOSITION IS LESS ABOUTTHE RENEWABLE ENERGY WORK STRONGLY SUPPORTIVE OF RENEWABLE ENERGY WE ARE A% CITY THAT THROUGH OUR MUNICIPAL WATER AND POWER AGENCY WE ARE WELL ON OUR WAY PAST 40% FOR CLEAN ENERGY WERE. CONSTANTLY GO IN THAT DIRECTION THIS IS ABOUT THE LONGER TERM PICTURE ON A UT ON A TAX THAT WAS LOCALLY SUPPORTED LOCALLY PASSED AND SO THE STTE COMING IN EVEN ON A DE MINIMUS. EXEMPTION WE BELIEVE IT'S REALLY NOT THE ROLE OF THE STATE TO TELL US WHAT TO DO ON A LOCALLY ENACTED TAX ABOUT THE DOCTOR BROUGHT FOR US. AND JUST JUST THE PLAYED OUT A LITTLE BIT. I DO YOU HAVE A COST OF LIVING. ADJUSTMENT FOR YOUR YOU TT I WOULD IMAGINE BUT I CAN'T I DON'T KNOW FOR SURE. YOU YOU T. UT. IS THAT YOU COULD. IN A MAKE UP THE DIFFERENCE WITH A TEMP RIGHT JAIL SMALL.

WE'RE DOING A DOUBLE HEADER HERE -- ITEM NUMBER SEVENTEEN A. B. TWELVE FORTY EIGHT MR GARCIA THE FLOOR IS YOURS THE BILL TWELVE FORTY A WILL PROVIDE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TOOL TO INCENTIVIZE OF REDEVELOPMENT AND REHABILITATION. FACILITIES IN THEIR COMMUNITIES BY ATTRACTING INVESTMENT FROM SMALL AND MID SIZE MANUFACTURERS. THE BILL WILL ALLOW. FOR GOVERNMENT -- GOVERN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO USE THE CAPITAL INVESTMENT INCENTIVE PROGRAM -- HERE WITH ME IS A JOE COOK WITH THE COMPANY MANUFACTURES AND TECHNOLOGY STATION TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU SO MUCH AS SUMMER YOU'RE GONNA TAKE THOSE AMENDMENTS AS WELL YES WE ACCEPT THOSE AMENDMENTS THANK YOU VERY GRATEFUL SEEM TA IS IN THE HOUSE WE WALKED ME SIR YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES. THANK YOU I THINK THE CHAIR AND AND THE COMMITTEE AS WELL AS A MEMBER GARCIA MANY MISTER I'LL COOK I REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION. BUT WE ARE THE PROUD SPONSORS OF A. B. TWELVE FORTY EIGHT HERE TODAY ALSO ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF LOCAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPERS -- WHO COULD NOT MAKE IT HERE TODAY BECAUSE THEY'RE SCHEDULING CONFLICT WHO'S ALSO IN SUPPORT -- WE SO AB TWELVE FORTY EIGHT HAS ENJOYED A BIPARTISAN UNANIMOUS SUPPORT AS IT IS MOVED TO THE ASSEMBLY. WE ARE HOPING TO HAVE THE SAME AS IT MOVES THROUGH THE SENATE THE PROGRAM THAT. WE ARE LOOKING TO CREATE HERE IS A PARALLEL PROGRAM WITH IN THE CIP -- WHICH WAS EXTENDED LAST SESSION. TO ALLOW FOR THIS PROGRAM -- TO ABOUT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS OFFER INCENTIVE PAYMENTS FOR MANUFACTURERS THAT ARE INVESTING FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OR MORE -- IN LOCAL COMMUNITIES WE THINK THAT THIS IT PROVIDES AN EXCELLENT MODEL THAT PROVIDES A WIN WIN WIN FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FOR THEIR COMMUNITY AND FOR MANUFACTURERS. FOR MANUFACTURERS WE SEE WE RECEIVE -- AN INCENTIVE PAYMENT IN THE BASEMENT ON THE THAT'S VALUE BASED ON THE PROPERTY TAX THAT WE BRING TO THE COMMUNITY. FOR THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT THEY'RE ALLOWED. TO COMPETE IN ATTRACT MANUFACTURING INVESTMENT THAT THEY WOULD NOT RECEIVE OTHERWISE FOR THE LOCAL. COMMUNITY -- THE CIP REQUIRES A COMMUNITY SERVICE PAYMENT THAT REPAIR IS PAID TO CREATE A DIRECT BENEFIT -- AN AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM MORE -- WE SEEM SEVERAL EXAMPLES LIKE A PARK THAT THE COMMUNITY WOULD BENEFIT FROM -- DIRECTLY. ALSO. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS NECESSARY -- BECAUSE THE CITY ITSELF -- IS TARGETED TOWARDS MAKE IT INVESTMENT OF A HOW A GEAR TOWARDS A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OR MORE. THIS JUST ISN'T MATCHING WHERE THE MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES TODAY WE SEE THE MOST INVESTMENT THE MOST JOB CREATION THE MOST BENEFIT IS FOR MANUFACTURING ABOUT SOME BETWEEN FIVE TO FIFTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN FACT. THAT INVESTMENT IS -- ABOUT PREACH ABOUT FOUR TIMES THE ONE OF JOBS CREATED -- FROM BEST OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OR MORE -- MANUFACTURING HAS BEEN THE ENGINE OF EQUITY -- HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS THE ENGINE OF EQUITY FOR MAJOR CITIES FROM SAN FRANCISCO -- TO FAIRFIELD -- TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER EDUARDO AND ONE OF OUR SEIZE DISTRICT IN -- BRAWLEY -- AND SO WE THINK THAT. THE ALLOWING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO HAVE THIS TOOL INCORPORATE THIS IN THEIR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PLANS WILL ALLOW THEM -- TO FURTHER SEE THE BENEFITS OF THIS -- ECONOMIC PROGRAM. THANK YOU SO MUCH AS A COOK THANK YOU FOR BEING HRE. THAT VISITORS ANYONE ELSE'S FOR THE BILL PIC PLEASE COME FOR THIS TIME. LOOKING FOR SUPPORT PERSON LASSEN ORGANIZATION. PERRANCE THE NUMBER NOW TO TURN OVER OPPOSITION. NOT ALL AT ONCE PLEASE. WE'RE GONNA BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR CONVERSATION SO BY SHEER. RIGHT. IN DOING. A REVIEW OF THE BILL I I SEE THAT. WE DON'T WE DON'T HAVE ONE MANUFACTURER YET THAT'S TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THIS. OPPORTUNITY TO IS THAT CORRECT. WE HAVE HAD MANUFACTURERS THAT HAVE STARTED -- IN ENTER INTO AGREEMENTS WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS -- BUT IT HASN'T THEY HAVEN'T COMPLETED THAT YET IT DUE TO DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES A LOT OF THESE ARE OUR DEFENSE CONTRACTORS IN THE BIDDING PROCESS THEN THE BLUES IN THE CONTRACT -- AND WE HINK THAT'S PART OF WHY THIS PROGRAM WOULD BE BENEFICIAL -- WE DON'T SEE A LOT OF MANUFACTURING INVESTMENT AT THE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR MORE LEVEL NATIONWIDE IT'S ONLY ABOUT 4% OF INVESTMENTS IN CALIFORNIA -- SO THE FIVE TO FIFTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR RANGE IS ABOUT A THIRD OF OF INVESTMENT SO. THAT'S PART OF WHY OF EVERYTHING AS IT. IS IS THAT -- WE DON'T HAVE ANY STUDIES FROM THE ALLEY OVER GOBIZ OR ANYONE THAT SAYS WHY THIS IS WHAT WE'VE DONE IN THIS IS. THE RESULT -- AND SO WE WE HAVE SEEN A THIS YEAR I WE HAD A BILL TO TO DEAL WITH -- CITIES THAT WE'RE GIVING MASSIVE SALES TAX REBATES. TO RETAIL WAREHOUSES WHICH BOY WE STOPPED THAT PRACTICE THOSE CITIES ARE GOING TO BE LEFT HIGH AND DRY -- IT'S GONNA BE REAL AWKWARD BUT I'M I'M SO SO LOOKING AT THAT IS AS THE YOU KNOW THE POTENTIAL FOR ABUSE OF A STEP -- THE FIRST WAS NOW YOU'RE GONNA HAVE MAYBE TWO CITIES COMPETING AGAINST EACH OTHER. YOU KNOW WHO'S GONNA OFFER THE BASTROP THEY ARE FOR THE SAME. AND THE OTHER WAS WHAT DO YOU DO FOR THOSE. THAT DID INVEST. AND HAVE BUILT THEIR MANUFACTURING BUSINESS A CITY AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN A COMPETITOR COMES AND GETS ALL THESE BENEFITS. AND THEN PUTS THEM AT A DISADVANTAGE. WHICH THEY DON'T THEY DON'T HAVE SO WE DO FOR PRE EXISTING. MEMBERS OF YOUR ORGANIZATION SO -- TO IN TERMS OF THE ISSUE WITH DATA IS THAT WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A CHICKEN AND EGG PROBLEM IN THAT. WE DON'T HAVE GOOD DATA BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T HAD A GOOD PROGRAM THAT WOULD SORT OF GEARED TOWARDS WERE IN THE INVESTMENT IS A WE DO ADD MORE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR THE SMALLER INVESTMENT IN THIS PROGRAM AND SO -- LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WILL HAVE TO REPORT OUT -- THE ECONOMIC ACTIVITY THAT'S GENERATED BY THESE INVESTMENTS AS WELL AS THE DIRECT BENEFIT TO THE COMMUNITY SO. HOPEFULLY WHAT WE WILL GET IS MORE INFORMATION THAT WILL HELP US IN THE FUTURE IF WE CHOOSE TO EXPAND THIS PROGRAM. THEN IS ELIMINATE THE CALIFORNIA DO WE HAVE ANY PROGRAMS OF THIS NATURE IN OTHER STATES WHERE WE CAN SAY ALL THIS IS WHAT IT. THIS IS HOW BENEFITTED IN AND WE CAN HAVE SOME HARD DATA YES ALSO THERE ARE SEVERAL STATES THAT HAVE -- EITHER PROGRAMS THAT ARE LIKE A SIP OR JUST IS FLAT OUT IN INDUSTRIALIZATION REVITALIZATION INCENTIVE PROGRAMS -- AND NBC THAT IN -- OF THOUGHT MY HEAD I CAN THINK OF KENTUCKY INDIANA VIRGINIA GEORGIA -- AND I BELIEVE BY THAT TO MY OFFICE DEFINITELY OFF TODAY I I DON'T WANT TO CREATE A PROBLEM. THE THE RULE OF UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES SOLELY OFF OF DO SOME MORE RESEARCH. IN AND SEE IF I I'M SATISFIED WHEN IT GETS TO THE FLOOR ALTHOUGH I DON'T THINK I'LL MAKE A DIFFERENCE. BUT I'M JUST I JUST WANNA BE CAREFUL. NO THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIR I NEED TO GO THROUGH -- MR GARCIA WOULD AFFECT ME TO DO IS WHEN YOU DO COMMUNICATE IF YOU COULD JUST MAKE SURE THAT -- YOU COPY A GOVERNMENT FINANCE ON THAT TO ALSO PROVIDED TO THE REST OF THE COMMITTEES WE ALWAYS USE -- JUST A STANDARD FOR COMMITTEE JUST MAKING SURE THAT EVERYONE SEES EVERYTHING COMING IN. WOULD LIKE ME TO SEE IF IN REALLY APPRECIATE AT MISTER VICE CHAIRS -- QUESTIONS ON THIS END AGREE FOR FREE BRING IN A FOR THANK YOU TO SEE IF PLEASE CENTER ABOUT -- IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE TAKING AMENDMENTS THE WILL. PRECLUDE US FROM ALLEN IMPACT. ON SCHOOL DISTRICTS. COULD YOU EXPLAIN -- PERHAPS MAYBE WE CAN GET. AN EXPLANATION ABOUT HOW THIS BILL WOULD IMPACTS SCHOOLS -- AND IS IT -- THE ARE THERE DIFFERENT THERE'S DIFFERENT TYPES OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS BASIC A SCHOOL DISTRICTS. OF OTHER OTHER KINDS OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS DOES IT IMPACT THOSE KINDS OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS DIFFERENTLY [inaudible] AND IN TERMS OF THINGS LIKE DEBT SERVICE OTHER KINDS OF THINGS. SO CAN YOU EXPLAIN HOW IT IMPACTS THE SCHOOLS. THERE WAS AN AMENDMENT I DON'T KNOW IF THE MEMBER COVERED DISH -- SO IT SHOULDN'T IMPACT SCHOOL FUNDING AT ALL -- THE WAY THAT IT WORKS IS THAT WE HAVE THE THE VALUE OF THE INCENTIVE PAYMENT IS BASED ON THE PROPERTY TAX REVENUE -- THAT THE MANUFACTURER PAYS TO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT VAN TAKES PERMITS GENERAL POT OF MONEY THAT IT HAS -- AND INCREASE THE INCENTIVE PAYMENT BASED ON THAT SO. I GUESS IT'S IT COMES OUT OF ITS GENERAL FUNDING AND ENDED WITH AN AT THE ROOT THE ITEM SIX IN -- PAGE FIVE OF A STAFF REPORTS ABOUT SCHOOLS. HAVING TO PAY ANYTHING FOR THAT -- YES -- L. IS A 100% CORRECT THAT THE THE AMENDMENT -- MEANS THAT SCHOOLS CANNOT PROVIDE FUNDING FROM THERE GENERAL FUND TO MANUFACTURES -- FUND FOR THE GENERAL FUND -- IN -- OTHER SPECIAL DISTRICTS CAN'T BUT SCHOOL DISTRICTS WOULD BE PRECLUDED -- UNDER THIS BILL. SO IF SCHOOLS A PROPERTY TAX. ARRANGEMENT WITH THE COUNTY. THAT IS NOT COUNTED. LIKE SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE ARRANGEMENTS WITH COUNTIES AND CITIES ON XTO -- PROPERTY TAXES SO THAT'S NOT INCLUDED OKAY. I DON'T BELIEVE SO OUR TO FIGURE OT OF A DOZEN AND I THINK THE AMENDMENT ADDRESSES YOUR QUESTION AND DOOR CONCERN WELL. I'M LOOKING TO THE AIR IN THE CONSULTANT GUY ABSOLUTE SIDE TALKING MISSIONS PIECE IN AGAIN. CORRECT -- NO IMPACT AS WELL. IN WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO IS THAT MISTER PETERSON'S GOING TO FOLLOW UP. WITH THE DETAILS IN THE MOMENT THAT WILL GO TO COMMITTEES BUT UNDER THE AMENDMENT. TO THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS I SHOULD SAY AS WELL AS THE AUTHORS OFFICE -- SCHOOL DISTRICTS -- WILL NOT BE IMPACTED AND OR COMMUNITY COLLEGE JUST. PRIOR TO THIS AMENDMENT LIKE SCHOOL DISTRICTS LIKE. LIKE IN ANY EDUCATIONAL. ASSESSMENT -- WERE. COMMUNITY CALL LETTERS OR THERE'S OTHER KINDS OF INSTITUTIONS OF FUND SCHOOLS. THROUGH THE PROPERTY TAX SO PRIOR TO THAT WE DO NOT. HAVE THAT CLEAR. THAT WAS KIND OF WONDERING WHY THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION. HAD NO POSITION ON THIS BILL. TO BE DETERMINED ON THAT ONE AND THEY HAVE NO PRISONERS. THEY DIDN'T OKAY I'M I'M JUST ASKING THE QUESTION [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH CENTRE BELL VERY GRATEFUL. WOULD LIKE TO IT MR BY CHER THANK THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I ARE PUTTING ON MY CPA PRO BUSINESS HAD AND I BRING ON MY COUNTY SUPERVISOR. HAD SO FOR MY COUNTY SUPERVISOR AT 9092% OF OUR COUNTY REVENUES ARE NOW PROPERTY TAXES SO. IN TRYING TO SEE IF I WOULD WANT TO ADOPT THIS POLICY -- I I WOULD ENCOURAGE MANUFACTURED COMMENDED TAPPED INTO TOWN BUT I WOULD THEN LOSE REVENUES AND HOW WOULD I MAKE IT OUT BECAUSE IF I HAVE MORE EMPLOYEE MORE PEOPLE EMPLOYED WHICH IS GOOD. BUT THEN I HAVE TO HOUSE THEM WHICH IS WHICH I DON'T HAVE NOW. AND THE GUY GENERATE SALES TAX WHICH I DON'T GET AS AS AS A COUNTY. IT'S ALSO HOW HOT HEADS FOR THE UNINCORPORATED AREAS HOW DID HOW DOES THIS. WORK HOW DO I HELP YOU. HELP THIS WORK. BACK AT IF IF I MAY REPRESENTING THE UP COUNTY. YOUR NOR YOU I APOLOGIZE REPRESENT THE COMING WITH THE HIGHEST UNEMPLOYMENT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AT 60% OF PRO COUNTY THAT IS -- THESE ARE THE TYPES OF PROGRAMS THAT THEY'RE LOOKING AT TO TRY TO STIMULATE ECONOMIC INVESTMENT INTO THE REGION. AND SO WHAT YOU KNOW YOU LOOK AT THE COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS OF CREATING. COUPLE HUNDRED JOBS -- PEOPLE THAT WILL THEN ADD BY HOME AND ULTIMATELY HAVE SOME DISPOSABLE. INCOME TO SPEND THEIR LOCALLY -- THOSE ARE THE DECISIONS THAT ARE MADE BY THE LOCAL JURISDICTION AT TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT -- PROVIDING THIS TYPE OF INCENTIVE IS WORTHWHILE IN THE CASE OF A COUNTY LIKE A PRO COUNTY THERE CERTAINLY LOOKING AT THIS AS A TOOL -- GIVEN THAT REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES ARE GONE ENTERPRISE ZONES -- WERE DONE AWAY WITH -- THAT THIS MAY BE A WAY TO HELP WILD INVEST IN THE REGION AND TURN AROUND THOSE -- ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES THAT HAVE PLAGUED THIS COUNTY HISTORICALLY AGAIN -- AS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA CELEBRATES THE LOWEST UNEMPLOYMENT RATES IN QUITE SOME TIME OF THE QUEUE WE HAVE A REGION THAT -- IS PLAYED WITH FOUR TIMES THE AMOUNT SO ULTIMATELY IT'S A LOCAL GOVERNMENT. A DECISION RIGHT TO MAKE THESE AND INVESTMENTS ARE THESE AGREEMENTS AND THAT DIED. THE HOPE THAT HELPS KIND OF UNDERSTAND WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES ARE SPECIFICALLY AND UNIQUELY TO THE DISTRICT THAT I REPRESENT. DOMINANT GARCIA IS VERY PERSUASIVE THANK YOU. GIVE. THANK YOU SO MUCH WOULD LIKE TO BE TO SEE IF WE HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS WE ALSO WELCOME THE MOTION ON THIS BILL. WE HAVE A MOTION BY SEN HER TITLE ON A. B. TWELVE FORTY EIGHT THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS THE MANAGER PREPARATIONS LAST CALL FOR QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. WOULD LIKE BETTER TURN OVER THE SUMMER FOR THE BETTER THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION ON THE MATTER AND RESPECT AS RIVAL THANK YOU SO MUCH AS A MEMBER -- OUR FOLLOW UP FROM THIS ITEM IS THAT THAT WILL WORK WITH THE SOME MEMBERS OFFICE TO BE ABLE TO GET THOSE QUESTIONS BY THE VICE CHAIR. WASABI CENTER AROUND THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE TAKEN CLARIFYING -- SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES TRICKS WITH -- SOME ANALYSIS BY MISTER PETERSON THE CONSULTANT ON THE BILL IS LANCASTER IF YOU CAN PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. WIRE BY WIRE I'M MORE LOCK. BELL. WELL I HERTZBERG RICARDO RICARDO AYE NIELSEN. THE FOOD AYE WIENER AYE WIENER AYE. FIVE TWO ZERO LAYS IN GENERAL MARIN KEEP THAT WERE STILL.

THERE'S A GENERAL COMMITTEE WE HAVE THREE AUTHORS ARE GRATEFUL THAT THEY'RE HERE WE'RE GONNA START WITH ITEM TWENTY SOME NEVER CHAIN NUMBER AND GO TO ITEM NUMBER FIVE ASSEMBLY WOMAN FRIEDMAN NEVER GONNA GO TO ITEM NUMBER. SIX SOME MEMBER Q.. SO -- WE WELCOME AS A MEMBER CHEN AB. FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN I CAN SHARE A SIMILAR YOU HAVE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT AS WELL ON THIS BILL SO IT'S GOOD NEWS THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU MISTER APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AND MEMBERS. I WANNA START OF AFFECTING THE COMMITTEE THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR DILIGENT WORK ON THIS I REALLY PRESSURE EXPERTISE EXCEPT ALL THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. OTHER OUTLINED IN THE ANALYSIS AB FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN IS A DISTRICT BILL THAT WE HOPE TO SEE BRAVE REFERRED ITS TAX DOLLARS BACK TO THEIR PARAMEDIC PROGRAM. THERE ARE MANY LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS A PAST VOTER APPROVED LOCAL TAXES TO FUND PARAMEDIC PROGRAMS ARE RUN THROUGH THEIR FIRE DEPARTMENTS IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT THE VOTERS AND BRAVE PRINTED PARAMEDIC TAX TO FUND PARAMEDIC SERVICES. IN THE CITY THE INTENT OF THE TAX WAS THE FINANCE LOCAL PARAMEDIC PROGRAM. WENT REDEVELOPMENT WAS CREATED IN THE PORTION OF THE PARAMEDIC TAPS WAS CAPTURED BY THE REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY AND IS A VERSION REMAINS IN EFFECT TODAY. AB FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN RESTORE FUND THE PARAMEDIC PROGRAM WHICH IS ITS FIRST INTENDED PURPOSE. THE OUTSTANDING REDEVELOPMENT OBLIGATIONS WOULD PAY FOR FROM OTHER TAX REVENUE RESOURCES FROM THE CITY OF BREA. THEREFORE THE PAYMENT TASCAM ALLOCATED FOR THE PURPOSE INTENDED BY THE VOTERS. FOR A PARAMEDIC PROGRAM. THERE HAVE ISSUE BILLS OF THE LEGISLATURE HAS ADOPTED IN THE PAST THAT DEAL WITH SIMILAR VOTER APPROVED TAXES AND THIS BILL WILL ADD PERMITTED PROGRAMS TO THAT LIST. HERE WITH ME TO TESTIFY IS COUNCIL MEMBER CECILIA HOSTAGE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS IS ALSO A FIRE CHIEF THE ZEBRA AND ADAM LOANS SHARES OF PRECISION MANTRA BILL GRAY ARTEM. THANK YOU SO MUCH SOME APPRECIATE YOUR WORK ON THIS FOR AND TURN OVER THE COUNCILMAN COUNCILMAN WE WELCOME YOU TO COMMITTEE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HANGING WITH US WE APOLOGIZE ABOUT THE DELAY. NO PROBLEM YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT TWO MINUTES MA'AM AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BLIND SHADE I'D LIKE TO START BY GIVING YOU A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND ON THE CITY OF BREA. I'M IT WE'RE ONE OF THE SMALLEST CITIES AND ONE OF THE OLDEST CITIES IN NORTH ORANGE COUNTY WE'RE ON NESTLED IN THE HILLS SCIENCE BORDERED BY AND INCORPORATED LA COUNTY AND SAN BENITO COUNTY. WHEN THIS UP TAX WAS PASSED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT WE WERE CITY OF SEVENTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE WE HAVE SINCE GROWN TO OVER FORTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE? WITH A DAYTIME POPULATION THAT EXCEEDS A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND SO OUR NEEDS ON ON UP PARAMEDIC HAVE CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY SINCE THIS TAX WAS PASSED -- WE I LOST MY TRAIN OF THOUGHT THERE I'M SORRY I APOLOGIZE ABOUT 81% OF OUR FIRE CALLS RIGHT NOW ARE PARAMEDIC. SO BY RESTORING THE FULL AMOUNT OF THIS TAX INCREMENTS FOR WHAT THE VOTERS INTENDED IT TO BE WE WILL NOT HAVE TO BACK FILL THE PROGRAM WITH APPROXIMATELY ONE POINT FOUR MILLION. OF OUR GENERAL FUND WHICH WOULD ALLOW US TO DO A LOT OF OTHER THINGS WITHOUT MONEY. SO IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS WE ARE HERE TO ANSWER THEM. CONSUMER THANK YOU SO MUCH WE'RE GONNA HOLD QUESTIONS COMMENTS FOR ONE MOMENT WE'RE GOING TO ALLOW FOLKS TO BE ABLE -- TO PROVIDE ANY ADDITIONAL SUPPORT COMES THAT WORKS FOR YOU AND AGAIN WE WILL COMMUNICATE ANY THANK YOU -- IN APPRECIATE ALL THE HARD WORK BY THIS IN MEN AS WELL WE NOW WOULD LIKE TO GET A WELCOME ANYONE ELSE WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. IF YOU COULD PLEASE COME FOR THIS TIME. WE LOOK AT THOSE WHO ARE IN SUPPORT. LAST CALL NOW I WOULD LIKE TO GET A LOOK FOR THOSE WHO MAY BE IN OPPOSITION. GLASCOFF OPPOSITION. WOULD LIKE TO BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS WILL START WITH A VICE CHAIR AND GO TO SENATE ABOUT. ONE QUICK QUESTION IS ROMAN CHEN HI HOW DID. HOW DID THIS GET INTERTWINED WITH ART WITH REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY AT? BECAUSE AS A FORMER TAX COLLECTOR JUST WOULDN'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED IN THE REDEVELOPMENT AREAS ALL OF THE TAX INCREMENTS. IS DEDICATED TO PAYING OFF WITH JUST THE TAXI INDEBTEDNESS RIGHT TO THE PARAMEDICS RIGHT. IT'S IT'S NO IT'S ALL IT'S ALL THE PROPERTY TAX INCLUDING THE PARAMEDIC TAX IN THE REDEVELOPMENT AREAS IS BEING USED TO PAY OFF THE BOND DEBT FOR THE REDEVELOPMENT AREAS WE DON'T NEED THE PARAMEDIC TAX PORTION OF IT. TO PAY OFF THAT DEBT WE HAVE SUFFICIENT FUNDS TO PAY IT OFF WITHOUT THE PARAMEDIC TAX IN THAT AREA. JUST A CASUALTY OF THE IT ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY AND SOMETHING NEAR AND DEAR TO YOUR HEART IS THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE SOME OF THOSE SAVINGS FROM THE GENERAL FUND TO GO TOWARDS PAYING DOWN OUR UNFUNDED PENSION LIABILITY. TO REALLY PULL. WELL I WILL TELL YOU A BRAILLE WAS THE FIRST ORANGE COUNTY CITY TO SET UP A PARS ACCOUNT FOR UNFUNDED LIABILITY WITH SIX MILLION THAT HAS GROWN IN THREE YEARS TO SEVEN POINT FOUR AND WE JUST ADDED ANOTHER SEVEN HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND TO IT. MOST OF ORANGE COUNTY HAS FOLLOWED SUIT SO YOU OF BRIGHT CATNIP FOR AYE MR MORLOCK SO HEY THERE WE GO. IT'S GOOD STUFF. THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIR. WHERE TO TURN OVER TO CENTER ABOUT? JUST HAD A SUMMER COURSE IN THE LAST -- ONE MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THIS BILL -- BY. ADOPTING THE BILL WILL. IMPACT SCHOOL FUNDING BY DEFERRING. PROPERTY TAXES THAT OTHERWISE. GO FROM THE SUCCESSOR AGENCY TO WRECKED PROPERTY TAX THE WOULD GO TO SCHOOLS. IS THAT CORRECT. AB. CHAIRED BY MAY I ANSWER THE QUESTION SO LET US INTRODUCE YOURSELF ARSON LASSEN ORGAN OF JAIL GUARD A CITY MANAGER FOR CITY OF BREA. WHAT WAS NOT IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS IS THE CITY BRAY HAS TAKEN SIGNIFICANT STEPS OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS TO LOWER OUR ENFORCEABLE OBLIGATIONS? IN OTHER WORDS GIVE BACK TO THE TAXING ENTITIES. JUST TWO YEARS AGO WE LOWERED OUR DEBT SERVICE ABOUT TWO POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS TO THE BENEFIT OF THE TAXING ENTITIES WITHIN THE NEXT TWENTY FOUR MONTHS THE ENFORCEABLE OBLIGATIONS WILL DROP ANOTHER TWO POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS I KNOW I KNOW YOU'RE YOU'RE DOING THAT. SURE BECAUSE YOU'RE REQUIRED TO BY STATE LAW CORRECT. THAT'S CORRECT INTEREST YOUR YOUR YOU'RE REQUIRED TO DO THAT BECAUSE OF YOUR CREATION OF SUCCESSES AGENCY AND OTHERS A PLAN. FOR THE SUCCESS OR AGENCY RIGHT TO REDUCE. THE PROPERTY TAX SO WHAT I'M SAYING IS [inaudible] BY. THE FRIEND OUT AND THEN EITHER STANDARDS. FIVE OTHER CITIES IS THAT ALL WE KNOW THERE MIGHT BE MORE. THERE MIGHT BE MORE CITIES IT LOOKS LIKE FREMONT SAN ANSELMO. REDLANDS IN GARDEN GROVE. IN WHAT IS YOUR LIMON IN THIS JUST TO THE CITY BREA. YEAH YEAH THE CENTER WHICH IS WHAT IF WE DO THIS FOR THEM IT. IT MAY APPLY TO OTHER WE MAY SEE OTHERS COMING FOR TARA FOR FOR THE SAME REASON SO WHICH KIND OF SET THE PRESS. SO SO IT WILL HAVE AN IMPACT ON SCHOOLS. I WAS QUITE HEAVY HAVE YOU COMMITTED WITH THE SCHOOLS ON THIS ISSUE. OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT RAIL INTO SCHOLARSHIP UNDERSTANDS WHAT WE'RE DOING. THERE SUPPORTIVE OF IT ABOUT CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION OF THE TAKEN IF NOT TAKEN A POSITION HAVEN'T OKAY THEY JUST. THEY'RE LETTING THE PROPERTY TAX BE DIVERTED. OKAY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU WE BELIEVE IT'S GOING TO BE.

ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS COMMENTS OR CONVERSATION -- FROM THE COMMITTEE ON THIS ISSUE ON AB FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN ITEM. TWENTY ALL RIGHT WE DO HAVE A MOTION ON THE FLOOR THIS MOTION IS DO PASS AS AMENDED TO PREPARATIONS A MEMBER WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE PLEASE. RESPECT RESTAURANT ON OVER THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS AND WE WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO THINK OF THE COUNCILMEN CITY MANAGER FOR BEING HERE AS WELL IT'S GOOD TO HAVE YOU IN COMMITTEE TODAY. AGAIN DO PASSES AMENDED TO PREPARATIONS AS LANCASTER CAN PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. HI WHERE I'M MORE LOCK LOCK AYE BELL. I HEARD THERE RICARDO. HELLO I NIELSEN. AYE WIENER HI. CURRENTLY YOU IS A SIX YEAR VOTE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT THINK SO MUCH THAT YOU REMEMBER VERY MUCH THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU ALL. ALRIGHT LADIES ARE NOW MOVING ON TO ITEM NUMBER FIVE THIS IS AB FIVE EIGHTY SEVEN THIS IS ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN. WERE THEN GOING TO GO TO ITEM NUMBER SIX AB SIX HUNDRED SOME EVER TIãU. THEY WERE GOING TO GO TO ITEM NUMBER ELEVEN EIGHTY NINE THIRTY ONE SOME NUMBER WARNER FOR BACK. WE'RE GONNA TURN IT OVER TO MISS FRIEDMAN ON ITEM NUMBER FIVE ITEM NUMBER FIVE ENJOYS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT MA'AM THE FLOOR IS YOURS SIMILAR WORK WE WELCOME YOU TO COMMITTEE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF FIRST OF ALL I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR AND YOUR STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US ON THIS BILL -- THAT WE WILL TAKE THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AS OUTLINED ON PAGE FOUR OF THE ANALYSIS. THIS IS A VERY GOOD AT YOU BILL THAT HAS HAD BIPARTISAN SUPPORT AND HAS NO OPPOSITION AND WHAT IT DOES IS IT BUILDS ON A VERY SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM AT HABITAT FOR HUMANITY DEVELOPED AND THEY ARE THE ONES WHO BROUGHT THE IDEA FOR THE BILL TO US -- IN SANTA CRUZ WHERE THEY WERE ABLE TO BUILD THE WAY THEY NORMALLY DO BUILD A HOUSE AND THEN THEY BUILT IN EIGHTY YOU BEHIND THAT HOUSE AND WHAT THEY'RE ALLOWED TO DO IN SANTA CRUZ IS A DIFF SUBDIVIDE THOSE LOTS EVEN THOUGH NORMALLY YOU CAN'T SUBDIVIDE A SINGLE FAMILY. LOT WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT ALLOWS LOCALITIES IF THEY SO CHOOSE TO PARTNER WITH NONPROFIT DEVELOPERS LIKE HABITAT FOR HUMANITY AND SET UP A PROCESS BY WHICH THEY COULD SELL THE FRONT HOUSE. AN EITHER SELL THE EIGHTY YOU TO ANOTHER LOW INCOME FAMILIES OR IF THEY CHOOSE TO RETAIN IT THEMSELVES AND RENTED OUT AS A LOW INCOME RENTAL THIS IS AN OPT IN FOR COMMUNITIES. THE COMMUNITIES WHEN IT COMES TO HABITAT ANOTHER LOW INCOME DEVELOPERS ARE THE PARTNERS WITH THESE DEVELOPERS SO YOU'RE DOING THIS WITH THE CONSENT OF THE LOCALITY BUT IN MANY LOCALITIES SUCH AS LOS ANGELES THERE WAS NO WAY THERE IS NO MECHANISM TO DO THIS. SO WE WORKED ALSO WITH THE TOP WITH -- JEFF PRANG THE ASSESSOR TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY COULD DEAL WITH ALL OF THE TAX IMPLICATIONS FOR THE WE COULD CLEAR THE WAY TO ALLOW MORE OF THESE INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS. WITH ME TODAY TO SPEAK IS SO SAD ABOUT IT OUT FOR OUR FROM HABITAT FOR ME FOR HUMANITY.

MANY OF THE RESIDENTS THAT WE WORK WITH OUR LIVING IN DISADVANTAGED UNINCORPORATED COMMUNITIES A LACK ACCESS TO SAFE DRINKING WATER AND ADEQUATE WASTE WATER SYSTEMS. AS WELL AS OTHER BASIC SERVICES AND INFRASTRUCTURE DESPITE THE FACT THAT MANY OF THEM ARE IN VERY CLOSE PROXIMITY TO OR SURROUNDED BY CITIES THAT PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES. HISTORICAL AND PERSISTENT NEGLECTED UNDER INVESTMENT IN LOW INCOME UNINCORPORATED COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA UNDERMINES THE STATE'S EQUITY CLIMATE RESILIENCE AND PUBLIC HEALTH PRIORITIES. EACH PLANNING AND LAND USE DECISION AS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO MOVE FORWARD IN ACHIEVING SAFE ADEQUATE AND EQUITABLE SERVICES FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. SB SIX HUNDRED BY ENSURING THAT LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES ARE ABLE TO SHARE IN THE BENEFITS OF AN ADJACENT ANNEXATION. IS ONE SIMPLE STEP THAT WE CAN TAKE TOWARDS THESE GOALS.

WELCOME WHAT HAVE YOU COME JOIN US HERE AT THE FRONT. THE SWISS REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA LEFT COVERED BODY. IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE THE FORESHORES ON A. B.. SIX HUNDRED YOU KNOW MANY INTRODUCING YOURSELF AS WELL. WHOA -- THE CHAIR OF THE LAW -- AND WE LOST A WHEEL. NOT THE FIRST TIME THE WHEELS OF FALLEN OFF FOR CAL AFTER -- SO IT'S OKAY WE'RE GONNA NEED TO WHAT WE SWAP OUT THAT WE DO SAID THE WHEELS FELL OFF [inaudible] BE CAREFUL. WE'RE GONNA SWAP OUT THE CHAIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE'RE GONNA TURN THAT OVER TO THE PIT CREW HERE IN A SECOND OUR SERVICE -- CERTAIN MODELS. IS IT UNDER PRESSURE. THANK YOU SERGEANTS AND DO APOLOGIZE ABOUT THAT. THANK YOU SO MUCH THE FLOOR IS YOURS AND ONCE AGAIN ALL RIGHT. A GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN IRES SENATORS I AM PAMELA MILLER REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF LOCAL AGENCY FORMATION COMMISSION. I WANNA THANK ASSEMBLYMEMBERS CHIU FOR ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE CAL ASCO AND ALL OF OUR MEMBER LEFT BECAUSE ACTUALLY SHARE THE CONCERNS OF DISPARITY OF LOCAL PUBLIC SERVICES. ESPECIALLY FOR RESIDENTS AND PROPERTIES LOCATED WITHIN DISADVANTAGED UNINCORPORATED COMMUNITIES -- DOCKS. WE SHARE THE NOTION THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS DESERVE ADEQUATE. AND SAFE DRINKING WATER AND WASTEWATER FACILITIES THAT'S NEVER BEEN A QUESTION. I ALSO WANT TO THINK OF THE MEMBER AND HIS STAFF. OF FOR HAVING ONGOING CONVERSATIONS WITH US ABOUT OUR CONCERNS HOWEVER WE STILL REMAIN OPPOSED -- AGAIN WE WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR NOT OPPOSED TO THE IDEA. OF ENSURING SAFE INADEQUATE DRINKING WATER HOWEVER THERE ARE SOME SUBSTANTIAL POLICY CONCERNS WITH SB SIX HUNDRED AS THE BILL IS. THE LEGISLATURE GAVE LAUGH BECAUSE CERTAIN STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS TO FILL INCLUDING ENSURING ORDERLY GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. THIS IS DONE IN A VARIETY OF WAYS INCLUDING THE AUTHORITY TO ADOPT SPEARS OF INFLUENCE FOR LOCAL AGENCIES. AND PREVENT EXHORTATIONS TO ENSURE ORDERLY GROWTH WHEN A LAUGH CO APPROVED A SERVICE EXTENSION OUTSIDE THE JURISDICTIONAL BOUNDARY BUT WITHIN THE SPHERE THEY DO SO IN ANTICIPATION OF THE LATER CHANGE OF ORGANIZATION IN THIS CASE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AN ANNEXATION. CHANGES IN AB SIX HUNDRED AD THE EXCLUSION OF AN ANNEXATION INTO A QUALIFIED SPECIAL DISTRICT. THE LONG STANDING POLICIES OF ANNEXATION ARE NOT ONLY GOOD PLANNING POLICIES IN MANY CASES THEY ARE COMMONSENSE APPROACH TO MANAGING LIMITED RESOURCES. BUT LET'S LOOK AT THIS ALSO FROM A SOCIAL JUSTICE PERSPECTIVE RATHER THAN PLANNING PERSPECTIVE. THESE ANNEXATION POLICIES ACTUALLY PROTECT THE PEOPLE RECEIVING THE SERVICES WITHOUT ANNEXING THE TERRITORY BEING SERVE THESE RESIDENTS DO NOT HAVE A SAY IN WHO REPRESENTS SOME ON THE GOVERNING BOARD OF THE AGENCY PROVIDING THE SERVICE. NOR DO THEY HAVE A SAY IN ANY POTENTIAL RATE CHANGES THAT MAY BEBE BE PUT BEFORE THE VOTERS TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION. OR WITHOUT A VOICE ONLY SERVES TO FURTHER DISENFRANCHISE THESE ALREADY DISENFRANCHISED COMMUNITIES. FURTHER IS THE BILL ANALYSIS POINTS OUT THE LANGUAGE DOES NOT ACTUALLY REQUIRE THE EXTENSION OF SERVICE IT MERELY STATES THAT THEIR SHALL BE NO ANNEXATION. IF THE DOT PREFERS TO ADDRESS THE SERVICE DEFICIENCIES STERN EXTENSION OF SERVICE. THERE'S OF CONFLICTS AND EXISTING STATUTE FIFTY SIX THREE SEVEN FIVE AID TO NEW SECTION SEE. I'M A ALLOWS FOR CURRENT STATUE US FOR COMMISSION POLICIES TO GUIDE THE COMMISSION IN DETERMINING THE SIZE OF THE AREA TO BE ANNEXED. WHICH ALLOWS LAUGH BECAUSE TO CONSIDER LOCAL CIRCUMSTANCES AND CONDITIONS AND WE'VE REQUESTED THAT -- THAT PROVISIONAL SO BE ADDED IN TO SEE. OUR I WANT TO CLOSE BY SAYING THAT WHILE WE APPRECIATE THE A MEMBER AND THE SPONSORS APPROACH. TO AND TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM THIS IS NOT A COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION TO A VERY LARGE PROBLEM WHICH IS THE DRINKING WATER ISSUE. AND THE PROPOSED POLICIES ACTUALLY CREATE SOME UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THE BILL GOES FAR BEYOND THE SIMPLE STATEMENT OF PREVENTING SMALL INDIVIDUAL ANNEXATIONS THAT INCLUDE DUCKS THIS BILL DOES WAY MORE THAN THAT -- WE'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS IN GOOD FAITH MADE NUMEROUS SUGGESTIONS FOR AMENDMENTS AND UNFORTUNATELY WE STILL REMAIN OPPOSED AND WE MUST ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE TODAY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR WORDS WERE HEAVY HANG WITH US RIGHT THERE -- IN CASE WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS YOU'D LIKE% TO ADD A WELCOME. TO MAYBE IN OPPOSITION IF YOU COULD PLEASE COME FORWARD LOOKING FOR THOSE WHO ARE IN OPPOSITION AT THIS TIME. HEARING SEE NINE LAYS DOWN WE'RE GONNA BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE WE'RE GONNA START WITH VICE CHAIR IN WHAT MANY OTHER CONVERSATIONS MEISTER. RESEARCHER I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF SERVING ON LAUGH GO FOR EIGHT YEARS -- IN ORANGE COUNTY -- AND I JUST MADE IT ONE OF MY INITIATIVES. TO INCORPORATES -- ISLANDS INTO A CITY -- EVERY YEAR I TRY TO DO ONE OR TWO IN HIS IT WAS HARD WORK -- AND IN THE END SOME A LOT OF SUCCESSES ADDED WHEN REAL DISTURBING FAILURE I'VE. BUT I HAD -- AN APARTMENT COMPLEX THAT WAS ON THE BORDER. OF A CITY AND I WEEKLY WE WORK TO GET IT INTO ONE CITY AT THE AT THE AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY SAID ALL WE DON'T WANT TO BE IN THAT CITY WE WANT TO BE IN. THE CITY NEXT DOOR I MEAN JUST ALL KINDS OF I MEAN THIS IS A HARD WORK IT'S EMOTIONAL IT'S IT'S CRAZY -- BUT WE DID. AND I I'M SITTING HERE LOOKING AT THIS PARTICULAR BILL SIMMONS CHIU AND I'M I'M WONDERING IF. IT AS HARD EVERY IT WAS AS HARD AS THIS IS -- WE WILL VICIOUS WILL THIS BILL EVEN MAKE IT HARDER. AND AND THAT'S MY FEAR AFTER -- GET THE YOUR YOUR THAT YOU'LL NEVER REACH THE GOALS IF YOU MAKE MAKE IT SO UNTENABLE. AND SO I I I THINK MISS MISS MILLER HAS SOME REALLY GOOD ARGUMENTS COULD YOU HELP ME OUT. WELL ADDING. THIS THIS BILL TAP ON THE HE NON MAKING LEFT CO WORKERS AT ANY EASIER. L. AND M. WHEN I WAS ON THE SOUTH THE CITY COUNCIL WHAT YOU HAVE TO EXPERIENCE. WORKING WITH -- WITH A LAUGH COAL SO DEAN CAN OF THIS BILL IS NOT REALLY MAKING THE WORK OF AN EASIER BUT I IN RECENTLY RESPECT AND APPRECIATE DURING INPUT. AND DEFINITELY BE HAPPY TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH PHILOSOPHICAL. AND SEE WE CAN -- MAKE THEIR LIFE A LITTLE BIT EASIER. TO HARD FOR LAUGHS SO THAT THE THE ISSUE WAS GETTING A CITY TO STEP UP. CITIES WOULD SAY NO. AND AND SO I GET WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO THAT. THEY'RE GONNA SAY NO EVEN LOUDER. BUT WE WE DON'T NEED THOSE ISLANDS AND I CAN I CAN GIVE YOU A LITANY OF THE REASONS WHY. YOURS IS IS NOT -- OF JERMAINE PERHAPS TO ORANGE COUNTY BUT I CAN GIVE YOU A LIST OF OTHER. THINGS THAT THAT THAT WERE WERE THE SEEDS WOULD SAY THERE'S THERE'S NO WAY. AND AND SO. IF YOU IF YOU DON'T ALLOW. AT LEAST SELECTIVE DANIEL YOU'RE YOU'RE NOT GET THEIR ALL GONNA STAY ISLANDS I DON'T KNOW FOREVER. THE I. R.. WITH A POSSIBILITY MAYBE MAYBE JUST FROM MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE ARE YOU BRING BACK ALL KINDS OF FUN MEMORIES. IT IS THE CITIES AND I I TO SIT DOWN WITH THE CITY MANAGER'S AND TRY TO EXPLAIN WHY. THIS TO BE IMPORTANT TO TO TAKE THEM ALL IN THE END AND I TELL YOU THAT IT WORKING WITH CITY COUNCILS GETTING TOGETHER. FOR BREAKFAST THIS OKAY OW DO WE YOU KNOW DO AN EXCHANGE YOU TAKE THAT PARCEL YOU TAKE THAT AREA. I MEAN THERE IS [inaudible] SO I FOR THAT REASON BECAUSE I SEE THIS IS IS NOT -- PROVIDING MORE INCENTIVES I SEE THIS IS A DISINCENTIVE IN SO AYE BOBBY PROBABLY LAYOFF OPPOSED. THANK YOU MISTER MISTER ASHER. THAT WAY TO SEE IF WE HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR CONVERSATIONS PLEASE CENTER TILE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. OF SO I REALLY WANTED THANK YOU APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORTS IN TRYING TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE IN THE IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. AS AS YOU KNOW I'M FROM A SMALL CITY SINGER. THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND I'M VERY WELL AWARE OF THE ISSUES AND WHAT BRINGS. US HERE BUT I I THINK THAT THIS BILL REALLY. KIND OF IT CREATES CHALLENGES THAT -- FOR THE COMMUNITIES. AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THE THE UNINCORPORATED COMMUNITIES AND WE'RE TRYING TO CONNECT THEM TO SERVICES WE ALL WANT THAT IN THE IN THE VALLEY AND DOES IT DON'T HAPPEN -- BUT I THINK THAT IT'S WE'RE NOT THINKING ALSO THAT THIS THE CITY'S AT THE TRYING TO CONNECT TO ARE ALSO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES -- SO WHEN IT COMES TO COST IT'S IT'S NOT THAT. US CITIES OR COMMUNITIES DON'T WANT TO ANACS -- UNINCORPORATED COMMUNITIES AS IT THEY JUST CAN'T AFFORD IT -- AND I DON'T SEE ANYTHING IN THIS BILL THAT ADDRESSES THE COST -- I THINK THAT THERE MAY BE SOME LEGAL CHALLENGES ARE POTENTIALLY POSED IN THIS. WHEN IT COMES TO THIS BILL AND -- YOU KNOW FOR THE FOR THOSE REASONS SIDE I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY. I BELIEVE THE COST ISSUE WAS THE ADDRESS IN THE PREVIOUS BILL FROM LAST YEAR. THAT THE DID THE DID THE STATE IS PAYING FOR THE CONNECTION. OF OF OF THE WATER TO THE DISPROVED DISADVANTAGE CONCOMITANT SO THIS BILL DOES NOT IMPOSE ANY ADDITIONAL COST TO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT SOLD. FOR EXAMPLE IF THERE'S AN UNINCORPORATED COMMUNITY. THAT WANTS TO BE A NEXT TO ANOTHER CITY [inaudible] RIGHT. WHO WHO WHAT UP THERE'S A COST TO ANNEXATION? RIGHT THE CONNECTION YES DEFINITELY SO WHO WHO WOULD PAY FOR THAT COST OF ANY BUSINESS DISS STATE WILL PAY. FOR OVER MY PROOF OF A BILL FROM LAST YEAR I CAN REMEMBER IN THE BILL NUMBER. SO SENATOR IF IT WORKS YOU CAN HAVE BEEN JORDAN ALSO -- CHIME IN ON THIS ONE PLEASE THANK YOU -- I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT THIS BILL DOES NOT [inaudible] ADD. ANY MORE. TO THE RESPONSIBILITIES THEN. IS IN CURRENT LAW IT'S BASICALLY CLOSING. THE LOOPHOLE AROUND THEM AMOUNT OF AREA [inaudible] THAT'S PROPOSE FOR ANNEXATION ALREADY EXISTING LAW ALREADY. STATES THAT IF IF A CITY IS ATTEMPTING TO ANNEX IN AREAS NEAR AN ADJACENT DUCK A DISADVANTAGE ON THE CORPORATE COMMUNITY. THAT IS TEN ACRES OR GREATER THAT THEY ALREADY HAVE TO KIND OF GO THROUGH THIS EXACT SAME PROCESS -- SO WE'RE NOT CHANGING ANYTHING ABOUT THE PROCESS WE'RE NOT PROPOSING ADDITIONAL COSTS WERE ESSENTIALLY. JUST TRYING TO CLARIFY THE INTENT OF PRIOR LEGISLATION SB -- TWO FORTY FOUR AND IT'S REALLY KIND OF AS A PRETTY SIMPLE -- FIX TO SOMETHING WE SEE IS A A PROBLEM IN CURRENT LAW THANK YOU. MR AND WE'RE GOING TO TURN OVER MISS MILLER I THINK THAT THE IMPORTANT. PIECE ON THIS IS WELL AS IT IT'S THE TRIGGER ONLY HAPPENS WHEN IT ANNEXATION IS ALREADY MOVING FORWARD BUT A MISNOMER SO AM. THE COUPLE THINGS IN TERMS OF THE THE FINANCING OF EXTENDING THE SERVICES THAT IS ALSO A CONCERN OF OURS THAT IS NOT ADDRESSED HERE. AND THE I BELIEVE IF I UNDERSTOOD THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER CORRECTLY HE WAS REFERRING TO THE BILL THAT WAS PASSED LAST YEAR THAT PAYS -- FOR SHOULD BE APPROVED BY THE WATER BOARD -- THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO EXTEND THE SERVICES BUT WHAT I'M HEARING SENATOR HER TADO ASK ABOUT IS THE ACTUAL ANNEXATION PROCESS WHICH HAS TO BE PAID FOR LOCALLY THE STATE DOES NOT PAY FOR ANNEXATION. AND I'M. OF THE WAY WE'RE INTERPRETING THIS BILL IT DOES FAR MORE THAN LIMIT THE SIZE OF A TERRITORY TO BE ANNEXED. NO I APPRECIATE THAT -- SOME EVER ANYTHING YOU WANT TO ADD ON THE WAY TO GO TO CENTER BELL. ANY ANY OTHER ITEMS YOU WOULD LIKE TO ADD ON TO THAT BEFORE WE GO TO SENATOR BILL. OVER I'M I'M DEFINITELY I KNOW THERE'S STILL SOME. WRINKLES I HAVE TO WORK -- WAS. TO THE LEFT WILL ALL BE HAPPY TO CONTINUE -- WORKING WITH SOME. THANK YOU SO MUCH A MEMBER CENTERVILLE -- I'M I'M SYMPATHETIC TO THE FISCAL ISSUES HOWEVER. A LOT OF THE COUNTY POCKETS. IN OUR COMMUNITY BECAUSE KANSEN CHU REPRESENTS SAN JOSE NEEDS SALAS A COUNCILMAN AND SO I WAS. HISTORICALLY THE COUNTY POCKETS A AS A WAY OF EXCLUDING RACIAL GROUPS. FROM LIVING IN THE CITY OF SAN JOSE BY PUSHING CARRY WORKERS HISPANICS. AND OTHER PEOPLE INTO THE COUNTY POCKETS. AND ALLOWING THOSE SMALL HOMES TO BE BUILT IN THOSE AREAS -- THE CANNERIES AND SOUND WAS A CREATED CANNERY TOWNS OUTSIDE THE CITY LIMITS. OF SAN JOSE AND AS A RESULT -- WE HAVE A NUMBER OF NEIGHBORHOODS THAT WERE NOT ANNEX IN FACT A NUMBER NEIGHBORHOODS THAT EVENTUALLY WE'RE TOTALLY SURROUNDED. BY THE THE THE THE CITY. LIMITS AS THE CITY GREW -- AND IT WASN'T UNTIL THE SEVENTIES EIGHTIES AND NINETIES. THAT THE CITY STARTED TO ANNEX. THESE AREAS IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATE LAW THAT REQUIRED. ANNEXATION OF THE INFILL. THE THE THE AREAS THAT WERE COMPLETELY SURROUNDED BY A CITY. WHERE YOU HAD A COUNTY IRELAND INSIDE? THE CITY SO A LOT OF THOSE AREAS. JUST JUST FOR FOR MY PURPOSES. LOOKING OUT AT HISTORICALLY ALSO I THINK WHAT I'M SAYING APPLIES. TO I I WAS A NUMEROUS CITIES -- WHERE -- HOUSING TRACTS WERE BUILT OUTSIDE THE CITY LIMITS. BASED ON RACIAL [inaudible] RACIAL PREJUDICE. OKAY IT'S BASICALLY RACIAL PREJUDICE CARRY WORKERS TENDED TO BE -- OF RACIAL MINORITIES AND HISPANICS. PORTUGUESE ITALIANS OF WERE IN A LOT OF THESE NEIGHBORHOODS OF STILL EXIST AND ALLOW THE FAMILY STILL EXISTS IN THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS. HOWEVER. WE HAD A COMMUNITY LEADER THAT CAME BY AND SAID. WELL OUR STREETS ARE ALL. ON PAY WE DON'T HAVE PROPER SUE THE AGE -- WE NEED. TO CHANGE THIS NEIGHBORHOOD. WHICH WAS CALLED SOUTH SUPPORTERS. AND THIS LEADER CAME IN AND SAID WE NEED TO ANNEX CAESAR IS TO THE CITY AND MAKE A PART OF THE CITY ANDPAVE THE STREETS. PUT THE CURBS AND GUTTERS IN -- SEWERAGE SCHOOLS ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS THAT HAPPEN TO BE SAYS ARE TRAVIS. SO WE CAME INTO SAN JOSE AND HE HE LED TO COMMUNITY SERVICE AGENCY. AND AN IN THE IMPROVEMENT OF THESE FORMER. COUNTY AREAS IN THE EAST PART OF SAN JOSE SO. SO FOR ME FOR MAY THIS IS MORE. KIND OF A SOCIAL JUSTICE ISSUE I DON'T KNOW THE AUTHOR WOULD REFLECT ON THAT I'M I'M GIVING YOU SERVE HISTORICAL. KIND OF CONTEXT TO THE BILL I BELIEVE RIDE RIGHT AND THE CONTEXT IS THAT [inaudible] COUNTY PARKER'S. THAT WERE NOT ALLOWED TO ANNEX TO THE CITY WERE USED AS EXCLUSIONARY AREAS BASED ON RACIAL DISCRIMINATION. SO SO I TAKE A CHECK. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. SOME FORM OF REMEDY WITH THIS BILL CORRECT RIGHT AM I RIGHT THIS IS A REMEDY TO PASS. INJUSTICES THAT HAPPENED. MY SO I TAKE MY CONTACTS OF THE BILL IS. I KNOW THE CITY'S FISCAL ISSUES A REALITY WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT. EVERY AREAS DIFFERENT. BUT QUITE FRANKLY -- I THINK THE SOCIAL JUSTICE ISSUE PREDOMINANCE MY DECISION. OF AND I THINK WE SHOULD DEAL WITH THE FISCAL ISSUES. BUT THE FISCAL ISSUES WERE NOT CAUSED BY THE PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN THESE AREAS. THEY WERE CAUSED BY OTHER PEOPLE THAT EXCLUDE THESE PEOPLE FROM JOINING THEIR CITIES THANK YOU SO THAT'S GOT IT THAT'S SORT OF MY STATEMENT AND IT'S SAN JOSE WE BEEN VIGOROUSLY TRYING TO ANNEX THESE AREAS. OF SO I HOPE WE CONTINUE TO DO SO. AND WE'RE NOT DONE YET. BUT I THINK WE I THINK THIS BILL IS MORE OF AYE AYE PERCEIVE IT MORE OF A SOCIAL JUSTICE BILL. AS ACT AND I WANT DOCTOR TO MAYBE COMMENT ON THAT THANK YOU THANK YOU BEFORE THE AUTHOR COMMENTS I JUST WANNA DO A QUICK TIME CHECK. SO THERE IS GOING TO BE A CAUCUS THAT -- MOST OF US ARE GONNA HAVE TO GO. TO AT NEW. OUT WE HAVE MISSED BURNER HORVATH IS WELL AS MR MULLIN HERE THAT WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO BE ABLE TO TACKLE A AND ACCOMPLISH THEIR THREE BILLS. I JUST WANT TO DO A QUICK CHECK IN ON THIS ISSUE AND TURN OVER THE VICE CHAIR. RICHARD THIS CENTER BELT -- WILL JUST MAYBE A COUNTERPOINT IS IS IN THE ATTEMPT TO TRY. TO NXT'S ISLANDS Là THESE ISLANDS DID NOT WANT TO BE AN EX. BECAUSE THEY LIKE WHAT THEY HAD. IN IN ONCE THEY KNEW THEY WERE GONNA GO INTO THE CITY. THE RULES ARE GOING TO CHANGE WHETHER IT WAS EVEN HAVING CHICKENS ON THEIR PROPERTY AND ALL KINDS OF ISSUES -- SO I JUST WANNA SAY THAT. EVEN THOUGH YOU TRIED TO ANNEX SOME OF THESE COMMUNITIES ACTUALLY. PUSH BACK AND FILE THE NECESSARY SIGNATURES TO OPPOSE -- SO. THERE IS A REAL INTERESTING DEAL AND AND WHY I BRING IT UP IS. IS I DON'T WANT TO MAKE THAT PROCESS MORE DIFFICULT FOR THOSE THAT ARE TAKING THE POLITICAL RISK. MY CITY MANAGER FOR ONE OF MY CITIES THAT WORK TO GET THIS APARTMENT IN PLACE WORK REALLY HARD TO GET HERS HER CITY COUNCIL TO APPROVE THE DEAL. AND THEN WATCH LAUGH GO TURN AROUND AND PUT IT INTO THE OTHER CITY. SHE LOST HER JOB. BECAUSE THE COUNSELORS ARE UPSET THAT THE TO TOUCH A POLITICAL RISK BECAUSE THEY WERE BEING CRITICIZED BY THE RESIDENTS AND SO. THIS IS A LABORIOUS DIFFICULT PROCESS ANNEXES ART ANNEXATIONS ARE NOT EASY SO. I I I WHAT I WANT TO TRY TO FIND A WAY TO INCENTIVIZE ANNEXATIONS -- NOT MAKE THE MORE DIFFICULT IT IS FOR LIKE THE CENTER COTTO'S. LEAST REFERENCE ARE YOU KNOW WHAT WHERE DO WE GET SOME MORE CASH MORE MONEY TO HELP. IN THE SITUATIONS ARE.

BY THEM NOT BEING ANNEXED THEN -- THEY DON'T GET A SAY IN WHO REPRESENTS THEM THEY DON'T GET TO VOTE. IF THERE'S THE OF A RATE INCREASE THEY DON'T GET TO VOTE ON THAT BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT PART OF THE OF THE DISTRICT BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT BEEN AN IN.

BUT WE DO WELCOME THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN TO COMMITTEE -- I ALSO A TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THIS IN A WOMANWE HAD THE ABILITY TO BEABLE TO SIT DOWN AND AND WORK OUT SOME. JUST MINOR ISSUES -- IN APPRECIATE HER WILLINGNESS TO BE A TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE. OF THE FLOOR IS YOURS ON A REALLY GOOD BILL THAT'S PROMOTING A VITAL BECAUSE I'D BE A. B.. NINE THIRTY ONE FOR SOURCE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS FIRST OF ALL I'D LIKE TO THINK OF THE CHAIR AS WELL AS THE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK N THIS BUT ONE HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE IN THE MEN'S. AS YOU KNOW WOMEN HAVE FACED A STORK DISCRIMINATION AND POLITICAL SPACES IN AB NINE THIRTY ONE IS NARROWLY TAILORED TO ADDRESS THIS HISTORIC INEQUALITY. AB NINE THIRTY ONE INCREASES THE REPRESENTATION OF WOMEN ON PUBLIC LOCAL APPOINTED BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS AND CITIES OVER. FOLLOWING. BY. TWENTY THIRTY ALL ARE NUMBERED LOCAL POINTED WHAT A LOCAL POINTED AND NON SALARY BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS HAVE AT LEAST ONE LESS. THAN THE MAJORITY MEMBERS BE SELF IDENTIFIED WOMEN ALL EVEN NUMBER LOOK LOCAL POINT ABOARD THE NON SALARY BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS HAVE AT LEAST 50%. AS PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED IN THIS COMMITTEE EIGHTY NINE THIRTY ONE ALSO PROVIDES OF THE TOTAL NUMBER OF APPOINTED BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS WITH IN ANY JURISDICTION. SHALL BE NO LESS THAN 50%. AT EIGHTY NINE THIRTY ONE WE HAVE A SUN SUN RISE OF TWENTY THIRTY IS ANEW WORD I LEARNED TODAY SO I LOVE THAT WE ARE ALL OF OFTEN TALK ABOUT SOME SENSE NOW WE HAVE A SUNRISE. A TWENTY THIRTEEN THAT GIVES CITIES OVER FIFTY THOUSAND A DECADE TO RECRUIT AND ENCOURAGE MORE QUALIFIED WOMEN -- TO APPLY FOR LOCAL BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS I'M VERY I ENCOURAGE I THINK YOU KNOW WITH LETTING WOMEN KNOW THAT THEIR SEATS AT THE TABLE ONE KOREJE MORE PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY TAKE THOSE SEATS AND I WAS ASKED FIVE TIMES TO DRUM THE PLANNING COMMISSION S. FIVE TIMES TO RUN. AND YOU KNOW IF YOU ANYBODY KNOWS MAN PRETTY TYPE A AND YOU WOULDN'T NORMALLY EXPECT THAT I THINK THAT'S A SYMPTOM. OF HOW WOMEN FEEL EXCLUDED FROM POLITICAL SPACES SO AB NINE THIRTY ONE IS REALLY ENCOURAGING WOMEN TO BE INVOLVED IN THE DECISIONS THAT EALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE FOR OUR DAILY LIVES RIGHT. OUR LOCAL BOARDS AND COMMITTEES AND SAID HE'S THE DECIDER ROSES SUTTER BUILT ENVIRONMENT THEY TALK ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO WITH PLASTIC BAGS AND HOW WE PROTECT THE OCEAN AND WHAT WE DO ABOUT STORM WATER. THESE ARE ALL REALLY VITAL -- DISCUSSIONS AND ISSUES THAT WOMEN SHOULD BE AT THE TABLE AT AND IT'S ONE OF THE THINGS WE KNOW THAT QUALIFIES WOMEN FOR HIGHER OFFICE SO. YOU KNOW IN WOMEN IN CALIFORNIA WOMEN MAKE UP 52% OF THE POPULATION AND IN CITIES A FIFTY THOUSAND OR MORE IT'S OFTEN EVEN MORE THAN THAT. SO WHILE WE'RE GONNA MAKE CONSIDERABLE ADVANCES IN THE WORK FORCE IN RECENT YEARS WE STILL FACE THESE INEQUALITIES THAT OFTEN PREVENT US FROM REACHING OUR FULL POTENTIAL I'M ONE OF THOSE THINGS IS WHAT WE WOULD DO WE DO IN OUR PUBLIC SPACES. WHAT WOULD YOU KNOW IN CALIFORNIA WE ARE GREAT AT HAVING AT THE STATE LEVEL A GOOD GENDER EQUALITY NUMBER -- FOR MANY OF OUR STATE BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS BUT WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING THAT TALKS ABOUT THAT FOR LOCAL BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS AND WE KNOW THAT'S THE PATH TO HIGHER OFFICE SO -- YOU KNOW AND I JUST WANT TO MAKE THIS PERSONAL SO WHEN I WAS ASKED TO BE ON THE PLANNING COMMISSION WAS ALL MALE PLANNING COMMISSION. I WAS THE ONLY WOMAN I GOT ELECTED TO HIGHER OFFICE WE REPLACED THAT WITH ANOTHER WOMAN THAT WOMAN GOT ELECTED HIGHER OFFICES NON ALL MALE PLANNING COMMISSION AGAIN. AND ONE OF OUR ASSEMBLY COLLEAGUES WANTED TO YOU KNOW GET APPOINTED TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION AND AND AVERY MAYOR SAID. YOU WILL NEVER GET A PLANE TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION THAT'S A STEP FOR HIGHER OFFICE AND THEY DON'T APPOINT WOMEN TO THOSE. THESE ARE REAL THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW AS IT IS A REAL PROBLEM WE NEED ADDRESSED TO REPEAT TO REDO THIS SO. I RESPECTFULLY ASK EITHER AND HAVE TWO WITNESSES HERE THAT THEY WILL ALSO ON TIME AND ON THEIR SUPPORT OF THE BILL THANK YOU THE HOUSTON EVER DO APPRECIATE ALL YOUR WORK ON THIS IMPORTANT BILL WHO WOULD LIKE ME TO GO FIRST IN WHOEVER WOULD. FIRST LAST ORGANIZATION YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES. I'M MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS LAND TRITON TODAY REPRESENTING AND FIND HER I AM A MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF THIS ORGANIZATION WHICH IS DEDICATED TO WOMEN'S EQUALITY AND BRING IN MORE WOMEN TO ELECTED OFFICE. AND I I THINK THERE IS REALLY NO BETTER SALES PITCH FOR THIS BILL THEN THE WOMAN SITTING NEXT TO ME WHO STARTED ON A LOCAL COMMISSION. WE KNOW THAT LOCAL BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS MORE THAN EVER REALLY THAT CON CONNECTION BETWEEN THE COMMUNITY. AND THE ELECTED OFFICIALS AND WAIT THEY BRING IDEAS AND CREATIVITY TO ISSUES THAT ARE SO CRITICAL AND CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW.

THANK YOU AGAIN FOR FOR WORKING WITH US -- HERE TO PRESENT EIGHTY NINE FORTY FIVE IT'S A MEASURE BROUGHT TO ME BUT BY SOME OUR OUR LOCAL BANKS WILL HEAR FROM IN A SECOND. WHICH ALLOW LOCAL AGENCIES OF GOVERNMENT TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF THEIR SURPLUS FUNDS THAT THEY MAY INVESTED SECURE FINANCIAL INVESTMENTS CALLED. RECIPROCAL DEPOSITS AND AGAIN THE KEY WORD HERE IS MAY I'LL START BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES -- SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS AND THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS MEASURE -- YOU KNOW THIS MEASURE AGAIN DOESN'T REQUIRE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO DO THIS PROVIDES THEM WITH AN OPTION. FRANKLY MOST STATES ACROSS THE NATION ARE YOU DOING THIS A CURRENT LAW PLACES MANY RESTRICTION THE TYPE INVESTMENTS THAT SURPLUS FUNDS. FROM LOCAL AGENCIES MAY BE INVESTED IN. YOUR COLLEAGUE HERE A LITTLE BIT MISTER MOORE LOCLE KNOW THIS FROM THIS TIME AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE. INVESTMENTS ARE SOUND. THESE RESTRICTIONS INCLUDE. PROVISIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT INVESTMENTS HAVE HIGH LIQUIDITY AND DON'T POSE A HIGHER RISK TO THE LOCAL AGENCY. THIS BILL DOESN'T CHANGE ANY OF THOSE RESTRICTIONS IT SIMPLY INCREASES BY 20% THE AMOUNT. OF AN AGENCY SURPLUS THAT MAY BE INVESTED FROM 20% 250% A CALIFORNIA IS THE ONLY STATE IN THE NATION WHICH HAS SUCH A CAP. OF THIS MEASURE WE WILL PLACE AT SUNSET ON HERE TO MAKE SURE WITH A BETTER. UNDERSTANDING GOING FOR THAT MAKE TO MAKE SURE IT'S IT SOUNDS AYE WINNERS IN THIS NEED FOR CAUTION WHEN IT COMES TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT FINANCES. BUT THERE ARE REASONABLE -- SAFEGUARDS IN PLACE THE LIFTING HIS CAP WON'T PLACE UNNECESSARY DO RISK ON OUR LOCAL FUNDS -- WE ME TODAY. OUR STEVEN FLEMING THE PRESIDENCY OVER FOR CITY BANK AND JAMES BACK WITH PRESIDENT CO A FIVE STAR BANK. I WILL ASK THEM TO TESTIFY ON BEHALF OF THE BILL THANK YOU.

WERE COMMUNITY BANK IT'S LOCATED IN THE CAPITAL REGION WE DO BUSINESS PRIMARILY AND THE SACRAMENTO VALLEY BUT WE ALSO GET OVER THE CINEMA COUNTY AND AND TRY TO HELP BUSINESSES OVER THERE. THIS BILL AB -- NINE FORTY FIVE SKEWS ME AND ALSO WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLYMAN MCCARTY FOR HIS FOR HIS LEADERSHIP. THIS BILL AB NINE FORTY FIVE IS REALLY ABOUT BUILDING CAPACITY -- CAPACITY FOR COMMUNITY BANKS TO SERVE THEIR CONSTITUENCY TO SERVE THEIR COMMUNITIES. THERE'S THREE WAYS OF COLLATERALIZED PUBLIC FUNDS A YOU CAN DO A THREE YEAR INVESTMENT SECURITIES PORTFOLIO YOU CAN DO IT WITH THE LETTER OF CREDIT FROM THE FHL BEING SAN FRANCISCO OR YOU CAN PLACE THOSE DEPOSITS THE COLLATERAL THOSE DEPOSITS IN RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIPS. OUR FOCUS IT FIVE STAR AND ALL OTHER COMMUNITY BANKS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IS REALLY TO PROVIDE THE BEST SERVICE WE POSSIBLY CAN FOR OUR COMMUNITIES -- PUBLIC FUNDS IS AN IMPORTANT SOURCE OF DEPOSITS FOR COMMUNITY BANKS IN CALIFORNIA IN THIS BILL WILL GIVE US ANOTHER ARROW IN THE QUIVER TO INCREASE OUR CAPACITY. BY RAISING THE LIMIT. OF LIQUID FUNDS FOR ANY MINUTES POWER YEAR OR SPECIAL DISTRICT OR COUNTY FOR THAT MATTER. FROM 3250%. STEPHEN A NIGHT OF ABOUT A YEAR AGO CREATED PROGRAM CALLED THE RISE PROGRAM. THE RISE PROGRAM SIMPLY PUT. ENABLES LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES DISTRICTS AND COUNTIES ANYBODY A SOURCE OF PUBLIC FUNDS. TO PLACE DEPOSITS WITH US WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT WE WOULD TURN AROUND AND LAND AT LEAST 50%. OF THOSE DEPOSITS OF THOSE FUNDS BACK INTO OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES IN THOSE JURISDICTIONS. A JURISDICTIONS AWARE WE RECEIVE THESE DEPOSITS. TODAY -- THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN QUITE SUCCESSFUL. WE'VE RAISED ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION IN DEPOSITS AND IT MADE PRETTY CLOSE TO A HUNDRED MILLION IN LOANS SO THIS IS AN EXAMPLE. OF WHAT CAN BE DONE WITH PUBLIC FUNDS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WITH COMMUNITY BANKS WE'RE ASKING YOU TO INCREASE OUR CAPACITY TO DO THAT BY APPROVING THIS THANK YOU. I THINK THANK YOU. FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK -- MY NAME'S STEVE FLEMING ON PRESIDENT CEO OF OF RIVER CITY BANK -- WHICH LIKE FIVE STAR BANK IS BASED IN SACRAMENTO AND CONSIDERED A COMMUNITY BANK. PUBLIC SENT SECTOR ENTITIES ARE IMPORTANT TO US IN A GROWING SECTOR -- SEGMENT OF OUR CUSTOMER BASE -- BACK -- IT LAST YEAR THE CITY OF DAVIS I DECIDED -- TO GO OUT TO PUT ITS BANKING BUSINESS OUT TO BID THEY WERE WITH ONE OF THE LARGE NATIONAL BANKS ON THE MATTER -- YOU WOULD HAVE SEEN IN THE NEWS QUITE A BIT AND THANKFULLY FOR US THEY MADE THE DECISION TO TO BACK LOCAL TO KEEP THEIR DEPOSITS LOCAL KNOWING THAT THE MONEY WOULD BE LENT OUT -- LOCALLY SO WE'RE PROUD OF THAT MAYBE MORE IMPORTANTLY DIVERSITY BANK AS THE LEADING BANK. FOR THE COMMITTEE CHOICE AGGREGATION I INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA WHICH YOU'LL ALL BE AWARE OF WAS CREATED THE LEGISLATION APPROVED -- HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE BAKE FIFTEEN OF THE TWENTY CCA ENTITIES -- WHOSE WHOSE MISSION IS TO PROMOTE A CLEANER CLIMATE AN OFFER -- CHOICE MORE CHOICES FOR CONSUMERS INCLUDING BETTER BETTER PRICING. EIGHTY NINE FORTY FIVE IS IMPORTANT FOR RIVER CITY BANK IN OUR CLIENTS FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS NUMBER ONE ALLOW US TO OFFER HIGHER RATES OF INTEREST TO OUR PUBLIC SECTOR CLIENTS ON THEIR DEPOSITS. AS GOOD FOR THE TAXPAYERS TO DEPOSITS CAN BE MAINTAINED IN MONEY MARKET OR CD'S ALLOWING FOR FULL LIQUIDITY IF THAT'S WHAT THE A PUBLIC ENTITY DESIRES. TOTALLY SAFE NO NO MONEY IS EVER BEEN LOST NO PRINCIPLES EVER BEEN LOST ON ON A A PLACE A PLACE WITH SERVICE DEPOSIT. AND EIGHTY MOST IMPORTANTLY IS JAMES ALLUDED TO CURRENTLY WE AFTER COLLATERALIZED THESE DEPOSITS AT A HUNDRED AND 10% -- WITH SECURITIES WHICH MEANS WE CAN'T WIN THE MONEY OUT. AND WE'RE ALL ABOUT. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT -- GROWING DO THAT BY LENDING MONEY -- LOCALLY -- THIS THIS BILL WILL HELP US DO THAT -- SO WITH THAT -- I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND AN SUPPORT OF THE BILL I DON'T THINK SO MUCH WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR FLEXIBILITY ON ADDITIONAL MEMBERS SCHOOL. FOR HANGING WITH US FOR THE AFTERNOON AS WELL SO WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL E'D LIKE TO GET OPEN UP FOR ANYONE ELSE WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. YOU ALL CAN COME FORWARD FIRST LAST NAME AN ORGANIZATION ROBERT WILSON CALIFORNIA CREDIT UNION LEAGUE AND SUPPORT THANKS WASN'T. OUR GREAT GLAD STAY IN CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY BANKING NETWORK IN SUPPORT MARKET HAS BEEN IN AND OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE ALL DAY SHE'S LIVING THE DREAM. AND A MYSTERY WHAT. STORM STRUCTURE IS PLEASE MISTER CHAIRMAN SENATORS COMMINGLED WITH CALIFORNIA BANKERS ASSOCIATION WE ARE THE SPONSOR OF THE MEASURE WE APPRECIATE. THE WORK OF THE COMMITTEE STAFF AND HELPINGTO ADVANCES MEASURE THANK YOU THINK THE SCHOOL ANYONE ELSE WOULD LIKE THIS BEGIN SPORTS ME LAST CALL FOR SUPPORT. CURRENCY NUMBER NOW WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME ANYONE IN OPPOSITION TO PLEASE COME FORWARD. GENERAL WE'RE GONNA HAVE YOU MAKE ROOM. FOR INDIVIDUALS CAN BE SPEAKING IN OPPOSITION UP MR GOLD IS GONNA BE DOING THAT THE WELCOME IS LAYING WHO'S BEEN HERE ON A VARIETY OF ISSUES MISSING WELCOME TO COMMITTEE. AND THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN VERSE CAROLING ON OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COUNTY TREASURER'S AND TAX COLLECTORS AT THE OUTSIDE OWNERS SAY THERE'S BEEN. CONVERSATION THAT'S BEEN ONGOING WITH THE AUTHOR AND HIS STAFF IN THE SPONSORS TO TRY TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING. THAT WORKS FOR THE TREASURE TAX COLLECTORS ASSOCIATION THEIR OPPOSITION -- COMES FROM THE FACT THAT -- WHEN THEY MAKE THEIR INVESTMENTS ON BEHALF OF THEIR POOL PARTICIPANTS ARE OBLIGATED TO OF TO MAKE SURE THAT DIVERSITY IS IS PART OF WHAT THEY'RE DOING? TO HEDGE AGAINST ANY POTENTIAL FLUCTUATIONS IN ANY ONE PARTICULAR -- INVESTMENT THAT THEY HAVE WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS I GUESS YOU INSURANCE IF IT'S CUT UP INTO THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR SEGMENTS. ANOTHER CONCERN WE HAVE IS JUST MAKING SURE THAT IF USING MORE THAN ONE PLACEMENT AGENT. THIS PLACEMENT AGENCY NO. IF THERE'S ALREADY MONEY. INVEST IN ONE OF THOSE BANKS SO THAT A SECOND INVESTMENT FROM THE DIFFERENT EMPLACEMENT A DIFFERENT PLACEMENT AGENT DOESN'T BUT THE SAME TWENTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS. ANOTHER TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS THE SAME BANKS WERE WORKING ON THAT WITH AUTHORS OFFICE. THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT CONCERN PRICE BECAUSE ARM MULTIPLE PLAYERS IN THIS MARKET. AND THIRDLY IF YOU LOOK AT THE STATE TREASURER'S INVESTMENT GUIDELINES THAT THEY PUBLISH EVERY YEAR -- THROUGH SIAC IT ACTUALLY DOES TAL LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DIVERSIFY THEIR POOL IN SO CONCENTRATING AND 50% IN ONE THING AAIN -- IS REALLY KIND OF INCONSISTENT WITH THE OTHER ON A STATE BODIES THAT OVERSEE HOW LOCAL GOVERNMENTS INVEST. AND AND FURTHER -- THERE'S NOT A LOCAL GOVERNMENT HERE SAYING THAT THEY'RE UP AGAINST THE 30% IN FACT ONLY DID THE SURVEY OF THE COUNTY TREASURER'S. THE HIGHEST AMOUNT THAT ANYBODY'S INTO THESE FOUR IS ONE POINT 5%. THE NOR NEAR THIRTY LET ALONE A DEMAND FOR FIFTY I UNDERSTAND HEARING FROM THE SPONSORS THAT THEY'RE REALLY GOING TO BE GOING MORE AFTER CITY MONEY. ANDSPECIAL DISTRICTS MONEY BECAUSE THE COUNTIES ARE NOT REALLY USING THIS YET -- I THINK ONE COUNTY TREASURER DID SEND A LETTER OF SUPPORT HIS LAST TREASURER OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE REPORT INDICATED HIS 0% OF HIS TREASURY IN THESE ACTUAL INSTRUMENTS SO. ON WE WOULD PREFER TO SEE IT HELD AT 30%. FOR US AND WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TALKING WITH AUTHORS OFFICE BUT THOSE ARE THE REASONS THAT WE COME HERE ON THE SECTION OF CODE THAT'S BEING PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED. AND SENATOR MORE LIKE CERTAINLY HAS DEEP FAMILIARITY WITH AND WE TAKE IT VERY SERIOUSLY AND THEY THEY JUST LIKE TO FOLLOW THE LAW AND THE UNDERSTAND WHAT THE INTENT IS TO DIVERSIFICATION. FOR THOSE REASONS WERE POSING WITH AMENDED THAT WILL ABSOLUTELY CONTINUE TALKING WITH AUTHORS OFFICES. THANK THANK YOU SO MUCH AGAIN. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HANGING WITH US TODAY BECAUSE IT'S BEEN A BUSY ONE A GOOD HAVE YOU HANG WITH US HERE I SEE THERE'S ANY FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS WOULD LIKE TO SEE IF THERE'S ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF THE BILL IF YOU COULD. PLEASE ADVANCE THIS TIME. LAST CALL BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE TO SEE IF ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS OR CONVERSATIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MISTER VICE CHAIR CRAFTING. AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR GOOD TO BE BACK NAY -- THE TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO THIS MONTH BY I LOST TO ROBERT CITRON. RUNNING FOR TREASURER TAX COLLECTOR FOR THE COUNTY OF ORANGE IT'S GONE BY RATHER QUICKLY BUT I I ENJOYED TWELVE YEARS -- AS TREASURER TAX COLLECTOR -- BEING APPOINTED AFTER HE RESIGNED. AND I WAS IN THE OFFICE FOR JUST A COUPLE OF WEEKS AND AND I GOT A CALL. FROM. THE TREASURER TAX COLLECTOR OF NEVADA COUNTY [inaudible] CHRIS DAVIS [inaudible] MY REMEMBER. AND IT IT TURNED OUT THAT. THE NEVADA COUNTY GRAND JURY HAD JUST RELEASED A REPORT THAT CRITICIZED HER. BECAUSE SHE PUT HER MONEY. IN COMMUNITY BANKS. AND DIVIDE MY GOODNESS YOU KNOW IN IN THE REPORT CAME OUT ABOUT THE SENATE JUST MET MY TO COME OUT JUST BEFORE THE JUNE. JUST. BEFORE THE COUNTY GOT CRAZY. BUT HERE'S YOU KNOW ROBERT CITRON EARNING. REALLY HIGHER INTEREST RATES AND HERE'S CHRIS DAVIS JUST IN BANK ACCOUNTS AND SO SHE WAS CRITICIZED -- HARSHLY BY THE GRAND JURY. AND SO SHE SHE CALLED ME BECAUSE THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS HAD. ESTABLISH AN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE AND ONE OF THE GENTLEMAN ON THE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE. WROTE A LETTER TO THE EDITOR AND I GOT PRINTED THE REGISTER THAT YOU KNOW HOW TERRIBLE IT WAS THAT. THIS TREASURER HAD JUST PUT MONEY IN BANKS. SO SHE WANTED TO KNOW HOW CLOSE I WAS TO THIS GUY [inaudible] AND A AND SHE SAID YOU KNOW -- I TOLD HER I DON'T KNOW THIS GUY I I I I I I DON'T KNOW CONTROL ROOM. WELL SHE SAID. YOU CAN TELL HIM TO KISS MY BLANK. AND YOU CAN TELL MY OF A PRETTY BIG BLANK AND ARE JUST REALLY WAS REALLY REALLY UPSET THAT HOW CAN I BE YOU KNOW CRITICIZED BECAUSE MY MONEY WAS SAFE YOUR MONEY IS GONE -- SO IT JUST SORT OF FUNNY SO HERE I'VE. BEEN INVOLVED IN SECTION FIVE THREE SIX A ONE AND INDEED I THINK GOVERNMENTS LÏNG POINTED OUT. THAT IS A FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES AND UNITED MY OWN INDEPENDENT RESEARCH YOU KNOW ONLY ONE CARRIES UP TO ONE AND A HALF PERCENT. SO WE'RE NOT EVEN PUSHING A THRESHOLD SO. ARE WE WERE A DISCUSS CAPITALIZATION RATES -- SO I JUST I JUST HAD SOME IDEAS MISTER CHAIR BECAUSE FOR ME THAT THERE'S THERE ISN'T A NEED TO GO FROM. ABOVE -- THIRTY I'VE I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN SO MANY DISCUSSIONS ON THE LIMITATIONS OF CERTAIN INVESTMENT CATEGORIES DONE LOTS OF BILLS IN MY TWENTY YEARS. BUT I'M JUST WONDERING IF A CINNAMON. MCCARTY IF WE COULD JUST LIMIT THIS TO SPECIAL DISTRICTS WHY DO WE BOTHER THE CITIES AND COUNTIES. AND IT HAVE A SPECIAL. JUST A SPECIAL CODE SECTION FOR SPECIAL DISTRICT OR MAYBE WE HAVE A TO A SPECIFIC. PORTFOLIO SIZES BECAUSE IF YOU. IF YOU HAVE ONLY A MILLION DOLLARS THEN GOING. TO FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND THAT MAKES SENSE. IN THE MID THEN THAT WOULD MAKE THAT THAT WOULD WORK. THEN YOU'D BE NEEDING A 50% OR THE THIRD OPTION WAS WHY DO WE EVEN HAVE LIMITS AT ALL. AND JUST [inaudible] GO. YOU KNOW LIKE THE REAL TO A SEVEN DID YOU DO WHATEVER YOU WANT. AND YOU'VE GOT OVERSIGHT AND BE CAREFUL. NUMBER YEAH WELL FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU. AND AND BY THE WAY MY INTRO I I DID MENTION YOU CELLS WAITING FOR YOU TO SELL OUT BECAUSE I KNEW IF ANYBODY OF OUR HUNDRED TWENTY WHAT'S THE WAY ON THIS TOPIC. YOU'RE THE ONE AND I'VE TALKED TO YOU AT LENGTH ABOUT -- INVESTMENTS TO COUNTIES IN YOUR BACKGROUND SO LOOK FOR TWO TWO YEAR -- INPUT O THAT STAND -- THAT SUGGESTION IS ONE THAT WE ARE -- CONSIDERING THE THE ASSOCIATION -- SUBMITTED TO US I GUESS THERE'S A HYBRID THERE BETWEEN WHAT WE HAVE NOW WHEN YOU'RE SUGGESTING SO THERE'S COUNTY POOLS. A SPECIAL DISTRICTS AND CITIES THE THESE TWO GENTLEMAN OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY BANKS ARE ARE EXCITED MEN TALKING WITH THE CITY SACRAMENTO ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITIES TO DO INVESTMENTS HERE AND WITH. IT AND THIS IS A BIG DEAL BECAUSE OF SMALL BUSINESSES AND OTHERS HAVE BIG PROBLEMS ACCESS TO CAPITAL THIS HELPS OUR LOCAL ECONOMY THRIVE AS WELL SO. ON TO TO TO THROUGHOUT THE OPPORTUNITY FOR CITIES I THINK YOU KNOW WOULD BE A CONCERN BUT WE WE WE ARE. IN -- WILLING TO DISCUSS. THE PROPOSAL TO TO LIMITED TO TO CERTAIN A JURISDICTIONS POTENTIALLY. EXEMPT -- EXCLUDE COUNTIES. BECAUSE IF IF WE'RE GOING 250% THEY MUST HAVE SOME AWFULLY TINY PORTFOLIOS BECAUSE OUR MOST TREASURED TAX WORKERS ARE ELECTED. SO THEY CAN HELP A LOCAL BANKS THAT'S A NO BRAINER RIGHT AND THAT'S JUST A NO BRAIN IT SHOULD IT SHOULD BE PUT IN TWO FIFTY AND AS MANY BANKS AS THEY CAN'T WRITE. AND AND THEN I CAN COME CLOSE. MISTER CHAIR IF I COULD GO THROUGH YOU AND AND I KNOW -- THE OPPOSITION AND NOW I'M CENTER MORE LACK TALKED ABOUT THE JURISDICTIONS EARNING THE APPROACHING CLOSE 230% SPANDEX ALLOW -- OF ART SUPPORTERS TO TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE HERE ABSOLUTELY WE'RE GONNA LOOK FOR A QUICK RESPONSE F THAT WORKS TO GERMAN OR MR GOLD IF YOU LIKE TO BE A RETIREMENT AS WELL. YEAH -- YOU KNOW MY RE INTRODUCE YOURSELF TO SEIZE THE FLAMING RIVER CITY BANK -- WE DO HAVE CLIENTS I MENTION THE FUTURE SEGREGATION ENTITIES THAT WE BANK WE DO HAVE CLIENTS WE HAVE FULL COMMERCIAL RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEM JUST LIKE WE DO WITH. FOR PROFIT ENTITIES THEY HAVE THEIR THEIR LINES OF CREDIT WITH US THEIR LOANS WITH US I WHICH WE HELP TO GET THEM GOING -- AND THEY KEEP ALL OF THEIR DEPOSITS WITH US THEY DON'T TAG KEEP TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS THEY THEY HAVE A FULL COMMERCIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH US. IN. IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME THAT TRYING PARCEL THAT OUT TO TO OTHER BANKS OPTICALLY BIG BANKS THAT ARE BASED IN THE AREA THAT ARE GOING TO TAKE THE MONEY BACK TO NEW YORK FOR CHARLOTTE OR WHEREVER ELSE IT IS. SO -- I THINK -- THERE ARE SOME SOME ENTITIES LIKE THE BIG COUNTY POOLS WITH RICHARD YOU'RE THINKING OF I BELIEVE WHERE I GET EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. BUT THAT DOESN'T APPLY TO ALL OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR ENTITIES. RIGHT NOW IT'S WHY WE SHOULD MAYBE. TAYLOR THE BILL. YOUR YOUR TO YOUR MARKET TARGET. I'M ALL FOR THAT. WHY MAKE EVERYBODY ELSE NERVOUS BECAUSE? MISTER CHAIR PLEASE BE SO WE RECEIVED A PROPOSAL MONDAY EVENING THAT I THINK TRIES TO BIFURCATE THE BILL IN THAT FASHION WERE VERY OPEN TO TRYING TO FIND COMPROMISE AND WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING THIS ISSUE.

IN ADDITION TO THAT I HAVE ABOUT FORTY YEARS WORKING ON PUBLIC POLICY SERVICES AND PROGRAMS WITH OLDER ADULTS AND YOUNGER ADULTS WITH DISABILITIES. SO ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA'S THREE POINT THREE MILLION MEMBERS A. R. P. MEMBERS. I'M HERE TODAY TO URGE YOU TO VOTE YES ON ASSEMBLY BILL ELEVEN EIGHTEEN THE H. FRIENDLY CALIFORNIA ACT OF NINETEEN TWENTY NINETEEN AS WAS SAID ON THE AGING.

TO STAY IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT THEY'VE LIVED IN THAT THEY HAVE PROVIDED -- GROWS TO AN OPPORTUNITIES AND A COMMUNITIES THAT THEY LOVE BUT IN SOME CASES PEOPLE NEED THE OPPORTUNITIES AND THE OPTIONS TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT. IN ORDER TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN CALIFORNIA NEEDS A STRATEGIC PLAN TO ADDRESS THIS GROWING DEMOCRATIC GRAPHIC SHIP. A PLAN THAT WILL PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES TO BUILD NEW LIVABLE INFRASTRUCTURES THAT MEET THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE OF ALL AGES FRANKLY. ELEVEN EIGHTEEN INSURERS AT THE STATE LEADERSHIP MOVES TOWARDS CREATING COMMUNITIES THAT ARE LIVABLE FOR ALL. AN ACTION THAT A. R. P. STRONGLY BELIEVE IT NEEDS LEGISLATIVE BY AN IS THERE ARE REPORT AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS IN FRONT OF US. THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE THE AS WAS SAID THE OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH TO INCLUDE ELEMENTS OF THE LITTLE BILL LIVABILITY AS OUTLINED IN THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION INTO THE GENERAL. PLANNING GUIDELINES TO ENCOURAGE STRONGER CONSIDERATION FOR OLDER ADULTS I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT THE DOCUMENT NOW YOU'D FIND THAT OLDER ADULTS ARE. BARELY MENTIONED IN THAT DOCUMENT AND YET IT'S A DOCUMENT COMMUNITIES USE ON A REGULAR BASIS. THESE ELEMENTS AS WE REFER TO THEM AS THE EIGHT TO A MAN TO LIVE ABILITY INCLUDE THAT. THE THINGS THAT YOU WOULD THINK OF RIGHT OFF THE TOP OF YOUR HEAD OUTDOOR SPACES IN BUILDINGS TRANSPORTATION HOUSING SOCIAL PARTICIPATION. CIVICS UNEMPLOYED APPOINTMENT COMMUNICATION INFORMATION JUST TO NAME A FEW. AB ELEVEN EIGHTEEN ALIGNS WITH GOVERNOR NEWSOME'S EXECUTIVE ORDER TO CREATE A MASTER PLAN FOR AGING.

CURRENCY NO OPPOSITION WOULD LIKE TO BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE WE HAVE A MOTION. BY CENTER TACO THIS IS A DO PASS APPROPRIATIONS WOULD LIKE ME TO SEE IF WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS OR CONVERSATIONS MISTER VICE CHAIR -- I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE. GOING TO DEAL WITH THE AGING POPULATION I CERTAINLY RESEMBLE. GRAPHIC THEY WERE ALL HEADING THAT WAY. IMPORTANT TO ALL OF OUR BUT LACKS RETIRED YOU BILL FOR CONGRESSMAN BRAD SHERMAN. AND WE WORK TOGETHER AND THE CINNAMON TO BOB NAY WAS GONNA CARRY THE BILL. AND THEN HE DISAPPEARED SO I THOUGHT WELL I'LL JUST CARRY IT MYSELF IT. RELATED TO CPA'S. AND AND THEN I GOT HAMMERED BECAUSE I WAS TOLD IT WAS SELF SERVING. AND SO I HAD TO WITHDRAW THE BILL I YOU KNOW I WOULD HAVE. BEEN IN FRONT BENEFITTED FROM THE BILL THAT I'M NEW HERE. RIGHT SO I I DIDN'T QUITE. GET IT -- IT WAS JUST LIKE OKAY LET'S JUST DO THIS SO I'M. MIKE MY QUESTION ONE OF MY QUESTIONS MISTER CHAIRS -- I HAVEN'T SEEN A BILL WHERE SOMEONE. IS THE SPONSOR WHO WILL THEN BE THE PROVIDER OF THE SERVICES. AND I'M LIKE YOURSELF COME FROM IS SUPERB IS ORIEL. BACKGROUND SO USUALLY YOU'RE YOU'RE USED TO LOOKING AT CONTRACTS RELATING DEPARTMENTS THE COULD CONTRACTS AND SO. I I WAS CONFUSED WHEN I SAW THE ITEM SO I SO IF YOU COULD JUST KINDA. HELP ME OUT HERE -- ON ON HOW THIS WORKS WILL WHETHER THE POLICIES OF THE STATE. AND YOURS IS FOR FREE OR IS IT. A GRAND TOUR YOU KNOW HOW DO WE WE GOT IT OUT OF A PROBE CELL. WHICH YOU KNOW IT'S NOT. THIS BILL IS NOT THE SAME AS PROGRAMS AND SERVICES IT'S REALLY ABOUT POLICY. AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE DOCUMENT THAT WE'RE REFERRING. TO AND YOU READ THROUGH IT IT'S A GREAT DOCUMENT I MEAN IT REALLY IT IS WHAT OUR COMMUNITIES USE -- FOR GUIDANCE IN OUR LOCAL IN OUR HOMES -- BUT THERE'S NOT MUCH IN THAT DOCUMENT THAT RELATES TO OLDER ADULTS AND I KNOW YOU COULD SAY WELL IF IT BENEFITS. YOU KNOW THE THE DOCUMENT TRIES TO BENEFIT EVERYBODY BUT THE TRUTH SO THE TRUTH IS THAT OLDER ADULTS HAVE -- ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND WANTED TO REMAIN. BE COMPENSATED FOR THERE'S NO THERE'S NOT REALLY ANY DOLLARS INVOLVED IN THIS EXCEPT FOR IT BECAUSE IT'S REALLY PLACING LANGUAGE INTO THE PLAN ITSELF. AND THEN LOCAL COMMUNITIES HAVE THAT AS GUIDANCE AS THEY MOVE FORWARD. HELLO [inaudible] WE'RE ASKING -- P. R.. HALF OF THE STATE TO JOIN A. A. R. P.'S NETWORK OF AGE FRIENDLY STATES AND COMMUNITIES RIGHT. IT WAS SAD. I CLUB. OR IS THAT WELL I GUESS YOU COULD THINK OF IS A SPECIAL CLUB -- AS I SAID THERE'S ONLY FOUR STATES INVOLVED RIGHT BUT IS CALIFORNIA THERE'S THIRTY SIX COMMUNITIES -- INCLUDING CITIES AND TOWNS AND COUNTIES SO -- IN MANY OF THOSE COMMUNITIES HAVE NOT PUT DOLLARS IN TO THIS EFFORT A LOT OF THE SEPARATIST WORK THROUGH BY VOLUNTEERS OF CENTER MAKE LIKE MYSELF. THAT ARE MORE LIKE -- SKINNER BROUGH QUICK. SENATE RESEARCH. I JUST WANT TO CLEAR THIS ISN'T ABOUT SERVICES PROGRAMS FINAL COMEY DARE PETE'S. THE SOCIALLY IN PLEASE PUSH BACK ON ME ALIGNING THE GOVERNOR THIRTY TAKING ACTION TO BE ABLE -- TO RIGHT TO MOVE ON THIS WITH THAT TO HIS PLAN AND NOW WE'RE ALIGNING REST OF THE STATE WILL AND THE WAY I SEE IT. IF YOU WOULD -- CENTERED MORE LIKE AS I SEE IT IS IT JUST A STRATEGIC PLAN TO THE COUNTIES THE CITY'S DEVELOP STRATEGIC PLANS I MEAN SCHOOL DISTRICTS DO THE SAME THING ON WHAT WE SEE THE VISION OF YOU KNOW MOVING FORWARD IS ALL IT REALLY IT'S JOINING NETWORK SO THAT. THAT EVERYBODY IN CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY CAN HAVE THE SAME -- STRATEGIC PLANNING -- IT DOESN'T IT'S NOT MONEY BASED I THE WAY I SEE IT AS YOU CONNECT TO THEIR NETWORK INSTEAD OF REINVENTING THE WHEEL YOU'RE JUST SAYING OKAY WELL HOW CAN WE BEST SERVE THAT. THE AIR PEOPLE OBVIOUSLY SHARON ON SIDEWALKS FOR EXAMPLE AND THEN JUST BEING ABLE TO GO TO ONE PLACE AND SAY HEY THIS IS WHAT EVERYBODY ELSE IS DOING AND SO THAT WERE OUT THAT ALL OF THE COMMUNITIES ARE CONSISTENT WITH EACH OTHER. AND WE DON'T HAVE ONE COMMUNITY THAT YOU KOW THE SITE WIDE I'M JUST USING YOU KNOW EXAMPLE THE SIDEWALK IS THIS WAY BY BACK COMMUNITIES THAT WAY IF WE HAVE A STRATEGIC PLAN. AND WE HAVE ONE YOU KNOW CENTRAL PLACE TO LOOK AT IT THEN I KNOW THAT CONSISTENTLY ALL OF THE THE LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO TO SAY HEY THIS IS WHAT THE REQUIREMENTS ARE AND THIS IS HOW WE CAN HELP THE OF THE THE BABY. WILL POPULATION HAVE THAT OF ME WITH YOUR VISION -- WE'VE GOT THE GOVERNOR THAT SIRI YES. ANNOUNCED AN INITIATIVE WE WE WE'VE ALREADY SEEN A COUPLE BILLS IN THE SENATE YES I'M IN YOUR WAY. HOW DOES THIS ALL DOVETAIL TOGETHER ON WHAT'S THE VISION? SO I WOULD SAY THAT HAVING RUN A OF SITTING COUNTY DEPARTMENT FOR ELEVEN YEARS AND HAVE RUN A LOT OF PROGRAMS OR WORK IN PUBLIC POLICY. IN MANY WAYS THIS IS YOU COULD SEE THIS AS THE UMBRELLA FOR THE REST OF THE WORK. BECAUSE COMMUNITIES CAN CHOOSE WHAT IT IS THEY WANT TO WORK ON SOME CITIES HAVE DECIDED WELL THERE'S A DOMAIN SO I'M GOING TO WORK ON TO SOME CITIES HAVE DECIDED WELL I'M GONNA WORK ON A LATE MAYBE I'LL ADD ONE BECAUSE I I DON'T WANT TO JUST DO HEALTH. I WANT TO DO ALZHEIMER'S SPECIFICALLY SO IT'S REALLY ABOUT WHAT LOCAL COMMUNITIES WANT TO DO THIS ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE THAT GOES INTO THAT DOCUMENT. THAT PROVIDES SOME -- INFORMATION TO THEM ABOUT WHAT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE AND THEN BY JOINING THE NETWORK YOU DO GET ACCESS IT WAS WAS SAID EARLIER. TO OUR PLANNING DOCUMENTS ARE RESEARCH ALL THE THINGS THAT WE CAN PROVIDE TO YOU THAT WE'VE ALREADY DEVELOPED FROM ACROSS THE COUNTRY NOT JUST FROM COMMUNITIES AND IN CALIFORNIA BUT THIS IS AN INITIATIVE OF COURSE THAT'S ACROSS THE COUNTRY SO. THAT'S WHY THERE'S NOT DOLLARS INVOLVED IN IT. IT'S MORE OF A MASTER PLAN FOR THE COMMUNITIES LAST QUESTION AND I'M NOT SEE THE OFFICE. OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH AS A SUPPORTER OF THE BILL. AND SO THAT WAS ALSO A CONCERN THAT THEY WERE JUST SORT OF IMPOSING SOMETHING. ARE THEY IN SUPPORT OF THE TYPICALLY AS LEGISLATION WAS FORD DEPARTMENTS ARE GOING TO ENGAGE THIS EARLY. SO -- HEY IT'S ME IT'S A MORE COMMON THAN NOT THAT DEPARTMENTS WON'T TAKE A POSITION ON THE BILL SO ALL AND THEN I THINK. YEAH NO NO ABSOLUTELY. NO NO NO NO DON'T DON'T ON THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE. LIKE TO GET IT THE NIGHT BEFORE RIGHT NO I TRUST ME I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND ABSOLUTELY -- FOR TWELVE YEARS YEAH YOU KNOW RIGHT RIGHT WHAT'S GOING ON WELL AND I THINK -- YOU KNOW YOU ASK QUESTION ABOUT -- THE GOVERNOR'S ORDER AND SO THAT THE GOVERNOR IS SPECIFICALLY IS ASKING STAKEHOLDERS TO DEVELOP A MASTER PLAN AND I THINK I SEE IT AS A TOOL FOR DEVELOPING THAT PLAN SO THAT IT'S CONSISTENT WITH. WITH YOU KNOW REALLY WITH THE A. R. P. -- THEY'VE ALREADY DONE THE RESEARCH FOR THEM AND SO IT'S JUST BUT MY MY OPINION JUST CONNECTING THEM TO THESE ARE THE RESOURCES WHEN YOU'RE CONVENING THE STAKEHOLDERS YOU CAN LOOK AT THE THE THIS PLAN ALREADY TO SAY OKAY THIS IS WHAT THEY RECOMMEND CAN WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THAT. SO I ALSO LOOK AT IT AS A TOOL AND OF COURSE THE YOU KNOW THE DEPARTMENT WOULD ENGAGE I THINK IF THEY NED THEY NEEDED EXTRA -- OUT PERSON ALRP EXTRA MONEY FOR THIS BUT BECAUSE IT'S NOT. THERE'S NO MONEY INVOLVED THE DEPARTMENT WARNING GATES THIS EARLY. MY OPINION -- THEY WOULD IF THERE WAS A COST OR ADDITIONAL WORK FOR THEM SO TO ME THAT'S A GOOD THING THAT THEY'RE NOT ASKED TO DO MORE IF ANYTHING THIS WILL HELP THEM WITH AND CREATING THAT MASTER PLAN. BY PROVIDING THE TOOLS THAT ARE ALREADY AVAILABLE. WHEN I GO TO CENTER TITLED WAS FRAZIER OF GOOD ON THAT? THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FREHLEY JIMMY I I'M I'M SO I KNOW I LOVE THE YOUR GOOD LUCK THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE. WE OFTEN DO MORE RESEARCH. ABSOLUTE ABSOLUTE MACINNES ROGER SIR TARA -- ANYTHING THANK YOU.

CURRENTLY ENJOYS A FOUR ZERO VOTE WE'RE GONNA KEEP THAT ROLE OPEN AND ALLOW MEMBERS AT ON THANK YOU SO MUCH. WE HAVE THE LAST ITEM -- FOR MISS RUBIO THEY WERE GONNA GO STRAIGHT TO MISS BURKE THIS IS ITEM NUMBER TWENTY ONE AB. FIFTEEN NINETY THE TAX LEVY. IT'S RUBIO FORESHORES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ON THE OUT THE FOR THIS ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT BILL FIFTEEN NINETY HERE TODAY. I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE SUGGESTED COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS LISTED IN COMMENTS FIVE OF THE ANALYSIS WHICH WOULD REMOVE THAT DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY REQUIREMENT. FOR THE BILL AS WELL AS THE TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS LISTED IN COMMON SEVEN OF THE ANALYSIS -- AB FIFTY NINETY AS PROPOSED -- TO BE AMENDED WOULD CREATE A FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR TAX CREDIT FOR LOW OR MODERATE INCOME FIRST TIME HOME BUYERS IN CALIFORNIA. WITH THE WORSENING HOUSING CRISIS OPPORTUNITIES FOR FIRST TIME HOME BUYERS ARE LIMITED DUE TO INCREASING COSTS ESPECIALLY FOR INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES OF LOW OR MODERATE INCOME. THIS INCREASING COSTS INCLUDES UNFORESEEN EXPENSES THAT CAN OCCUR VERY SOON AFTER PURCHASE SUCH AS AN ANTICIPATED REPAIRS. NISSAN FORCING EXPENSES CAN ALSO LEAVE FIRST TIME LOW AND MODERATE INCOME HOME BUYERS. ARE EXASPERATED AS THEY STRUGGLE TO MAINTAIN HOME OWNERSHIP WITH THE SKYROCKETING RENTAL AND HOUSING COSTS ACROSS THE STATE A. B. FIFTEEN NINETY CREATES A FINANCIAL INCENTIVE. FOR FOR LOW TO MODERATE INCOME INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES LOOKING TO PURSUE THE PATHWAY TO HOME OWNERSHIP. THIS BILL PROMOTED FINANCIAL PROSPERITY AND PROVIDES NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR CALIFORNIA TO INVEST IN THE FUTURE BY BECOMING FIRST TIME HOME BUYERS -- IN IF I MAY JUST CONTINUE THE MY FRUSTRATION. WITH A LOT OF THE RENTAL OR A LOT OF THE WHOLE. HOUSING CONVERSATIONS HAVE BEEN CENTERED AROUND -- PUTTING PEOPLE IN APARTMENTS -- AND THAT'S HOW I FEEL AND I THINK -- WE CAN DO MORE FOR OUR FOLKS BY PROVIDING THE OPPORTUNITY TO BOBBY HOME OWNERS -- THE THE NUMBER Y. AT ONE WAY OF CREATING WEALTH IS HOME OWNERSHIP AND IF WE CAN PROVIDE THIS INCENTIVE FOR LOW TO MODERATE INCOME FOLKS. I THINK WE ARE NOT ONLY PROVIDING A STABLE HOME BUT ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD WEALTH -- THOSE OF YOU THAT AT THAT HAVE A PROPERTIES YOU KNOW EVENTUALLY THOSE PROPERTIES ARE GOING TO BE WILL TO YOUR CHILDREN AND I THINK THAT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO TO RE WE INVEST. IN THOSE COMMUNITIES FOR HOMEOWNERSHIP AGAIN MY FRUSTRATION HAS BEEN THAT WE TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW WITH. MODERN WHAT IS IT UP THE WHOLE HOUSING COSTS BUT WE WANT TO PUT PEOPLE IN APARTMENTS I THINK THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR LOW TO MODERATE INCOME FOLKS TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO OWN THEIR OWN HOMES SO -- WITH THAT -- WITH ME TODAY. I LOST MY MY TRAIN THOUGHT IS OCCURRING TRACY ON BEHALF OF OUR SPONSORS -- BUT THE CALIFORNIA REALTORS THANK YOU SO MUCH.

A HOME -- BECAUSE OF YOU KNOW ALL OF THE FINANCIAL. BURDENS AND NEVER YOU KNOW DON'T EVEN TALK ABOUT THAT A HOUSING -- COSTS IN LA AND SO. I AM NERVOUS ABOUT IT TOO BUT I THINK THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO REALLY GIVE FOLKS A REAL LIVE OF REAL OPPORTUNITY TO OWN A HOME AND BUILD THAT WALL THAT WE ALL.

SO -- IN TODAY SHE'S GONNA BE BRINGING FORWARD AB EIGHT NINETY ONE I ALSO WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY THANK YOU SO MUCH TO SOON FOR WORKING WITH US ON THIS BILL THE FLOOR IS YOURS THANK YOU. THANK YOU SINCE HER AND AS SENATORS I WANTED BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE SUGGESTED COMMITTEE MA'AM IT'S IN COMMENTS FOUR AND FIVE OF THE ANALYSIS. AND ALWAYS AS ALWAYS THINK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS MEASURE AB EIGHT NINETY ONE REQUIRE CITIES AND TOWNS WITH POPULATIONS GREATER THAN THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND TO ESTABLISH. A PARKING PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES THE PARKING LOCATIONS FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS LIVING IN THEIR VEHICLES. THE AMENDMENTS TAKEN TODAY CLARIFY THAT A COUNTY WITH A POPULATION OF ONE MILLION OR LESS SHALL BE DEEMED COMPLIANT WITH THE BILL IF THE CITY LOCATED IN THAT COUNTY HAS VOLUNTARILY ADOPTED AS A PARKING PROGRAM. THAT MEETS THE REQUIREMENTS. AB EIGHT NINETY ONE PROVIDES LOCAL PROGRAMS WITH THE FLEXIBILITY TO ESTABLISH RULES AND REGULATIONS THAT FIT LOCAL NEEDS AS WELL AS AN APPLICATION PROCESS THAT CAN INCLUDE A BACKGROUND CHECK FOR PARTICIPANTS. PROGRAMS COULD BE CREATED UNDER THIS BILL WOULD ALSO BE ENCOURAGED TO COORDINATE WITH LOCAL NONPROFITS AS WELL AS CITY AND COUNTY AGENCIES TO PROVIDE RESOURCES AND ACCESS TO SOCIAL SERVICES -- THAT LEAD TO LONG TERM HOUSING. AB EIGHT NINETY ONE SHOULD BE SEEN AS A COMPLEMENTARY TO CALIFORNIA'S ONGOING EFFORTS TO ADDRESS OUR HOUSING CRISIS AND IS NOT INTENDED TO SUPPLEMENT. PLANNING OR FACILITATING LONG TERM SOLUTIONS TO PREVENT AND END HOMELESSNESS THE GOAL OF THIS BILL IS TO ENSURE THAT THOSE THAT ARE LIVING IN THEIR VEHICLES HAVE A SAFE PLACE TO STAY OVERNIGHT WELL THE WORK TO TRICK TRANSITION TO A MORE PERMANENT HOUSING. WITH ME TODAY WHO HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY PATIENT -- PROFESSOR GARY PAINTER THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU SO MUCH MANAGER SPRINTER WE WALK ME THREE OF TWO MINUTES THANKS SO MUCH FOR YOUR THANK YOU -- AS YOU MENTIONED I'M A PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA'S PRICE WILL PUBLIC POLICY AND I'M ALSO THE DIRECTOR OF THE HOMELESSNESS POLICY RESEARCH INSTITUTE WHICH WAS RECENTLY. LAUNCHED ONE YEAR AGO I I OFTEN CALL EACH PEER I JUST IT FOR SHORT BECAUSE THAT'S A MOUTHFUL -- IT COMPRISES THIRTY OUR RESEARCHERS FROM A VARIETY OF ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS THINK TANKS AND RESEARCH ORGANIZATIONS WERE WORKING COLLECTIVELY TO IN HOMELESSNESS IN LA COUNTY. I'M HERE TODAY TO STATE MY SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHT NINETY ONE WHICH REQUIRES JURISDICTIONS TO DEVELOP. A PARKING PROGRAMS IF IT MEETS THE REQUIREMENTS OUTLINED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER BURKE. RECENTLY H. BRI PUBLISHED AN ANALYSIS OF SAY PARKING PROGRAMS ACROSS THE WEST COAST OF UNITED STATES ALL OF WHICH HAVE COLLECTIVELY HOUSE OVER. THOUSANDS OF PARTICIPANTS INTO HOUSING THIS ANALYSIS FOUND ALSO BASED ON DATA FROM THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN DEMOGRAPHIC SURVEY. IN THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES THAT 35% OF THOSE WHO ARE HOMELESS ACTUALLY RELY ON THEIR CAR AS THEIR PRIMARY MODE OF SHELTER -- ACCORDINGLY SAY PROBE SAY PARKING PROGRAMS ARE AN IMPORTANT POLICY INVESTMENT FOR HOMELESS NEIGHBORS THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN DATA ALSO NOTED THAT THE MAJORITY OF LA COUNTY RESIDENTS WHO LIVE IN THEIR CARS -- I HAD BEEN FORCED TO DO SO BECAUSE OF A LOSS OF A JOB AND THE MAJORITY OF THESE RESIDENTS WHO ARE LIVING IN THEIR CARS ARE ACTIVELY SEEKING WORK OR ACTUALLY ARE CURRENTLY. FULL TIME OR PART TIME EMPLOYED THESE PROGRAMS PROVIDE VEHICLE DWELLERS A SAFE AND LEGAL PLACE TO PARK AND SLEEP IN THEIR VEHICLES OVERNIGHT. AND THESE PROGRAMS ALSO PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR OUR EACH TO BRING SERVICES RANGING FROM HYGIENE TO HELP THE JOB PLACEMENT TO HOUSING TO VULNERABLE FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUALS. IN SOME ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHT NINETY ONE WOULD PROVIDE A SECURE AND HUMANE SPACE FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES LIVING IN THEIR VEHICLES THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE JURISDICTIONS TO ESTABLISH AND PLAN FOR SICK PARKING PROGRAM'S. CLOSE THEM OVERNIGHT AND I RESPECTFULLY URGE EACH ONE OF YOU TO VOTE I ON A. B..

I'M DAVE THEY PROVEN TO HAVE ENOUGH ADVOCACY THAT I THINK WHAT WE SHOULD THINK HARD ABOUT IS THIS FEELING THAT A SINCE WE'RE IN A CRISIS MODE YOU KNOW THE I I KIND OF YOU THIS AS A CRISIS INTERVENTION AND AND UNFORTUNATELY TO DATE MANY PLACES HAVEN'T DONE. PROPER EMERGENCY PLANNING FOR HOMELESSNESS AND NOW AS WE SAW WITH THE NUMBERS GOING OUT -- IN A WAY I THINK IT'S TIME. TO IMPLEMENT SOMETHING LIKE THIS TO ADDRESS THE FACT THAT AGAIN IN LA COUNTY FOR INSTANCE 35% OF PEOPLE WHO ARE HOMELESS LIVE IN THEIR CARS RIGHT YOU MENTION THAT. HAVE YOU DONE ANY ANALYSIS ON SB TWO ZONES. ON SB TWO ZONES SB TWO ZONES pAVAIL TO WHICH REQUIRES THAT -- CITIES HAVE OF ZONING AREA WHERE THEY ARE ABLE TO PUT A HOMELESS SHELTER YEAR ROUND. THESE TWO HUNDRED BEDS. AND I WAS HOPING THAT MAYBE YOU'VE DONE SOME RESEARCH. ON THAT BECAUSE THAT WOULD LEAD TO A FEW OTHER QUESTIONS WHAT. WE TWO HUNDRED BEDS IN LOS ANGELES WOULD NOT ACCOMMODATE OUR 35%. BY ANY STRETCH NO I I HAVE A LET'S SAY A FEDERALLY I'VE GOT I MEAN WE'VE CERTAINLY -- LOOKED AT AT DIFFERENT LEVELS OF RIGOR -- ALL OF VARIETY OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF PROGRAMS TO ADDRESS THE CRISIS. AND WHAT YOU KNOW THE EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT THAT ALL ARE NEEDED GIVEN THE SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM RIGHT NOW -- BUT WITH AN EYE TOWARD THINKING ABOUT PERMANENT SOLUTION BUT JUST FOR BY WAY OF BACKGROUND ARE. COUNTY SUPERVISOR I SERVED AS CHAIR OF THE COMMISSION AND ALMOST AS FOR ABOUT EIGHT YEARS -- AND SO I'VE KIND OF BEEN. MARINATED IN THE SUBJECT THAT'S WHY. YOU KNOW WE WE TRY TO DO. BUT THE WALL SEVEN THE SENATE DID A SOMEONE TO THE SENATE BILL TWO I CAN'T MEMBER WHO THE AUTHOR WAS BUT IT WOULD REQUIRE. PUTTING A HOMELESS SHELTER IN YOUR CITY AND YOU HAD TO ZONE FORT I'M FINDING -- A REAL DISAPPOINTING -- RESPONSE TO THAT. I I YOU KNOW I CAN CERTAINLY AIMING THE CITIES IN MY COUNTY THAT DON'T HAVE. OR IT WILL OR IT DON'T HAVE AN SB TWO ZONE OR IF THEY DO THEY DON'T USE IT IT IS STILL. YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE OKAY WE'VE WE WE CHECK THAT OFF AND AND IT'S NOT BEING BEING DONE. SO. THE REASON I BRING THAT UP IS AN OKAY NOW WE FOLLOW IT THROUGH NOW TO A PARKING AREA. SO NOW. WHEN? FIGURE OUT HOW DO YOU INITIATE THIS AND AND HOW DO YOU. IMPLEMENTED AND THEN AND FOLLOW THROUGH ON IT BECAUSE I THINK SB. TWO IS LACKING THE FOLLOW THROUGH. IS ARE TRYING TO HELP ON THIS IF THAT MAKES SENSE BUT I'M TRYING I DO GET IT TOOK ME A MINUTE BUT I GOT IT NOW SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS SB TWO THEY DIDN'T FOLLOW THROUGH. ON THE MANDATE THAT SAID THAT THAT THAT SO AREAS NEED TO BE ZONE FOR THE TWO HUNDRED BED EACH CITY I KNOW ONESELF FOLLOW THROUGH WITH THAT AND YOU'RE JUST ASKING DOES THIS BILL REQUIRE HAVE WHAT OF THE DAY IT'S PROBABLY MOST OF OUR RESPONSIBILITIES UTILITY UTILIZE THAT TO ALL. RIGHT SO IF I HAVE CITIES THAT ARE NOT UTILIZING THAT TOOL I MEAN AT THIS POINT EVEN OUR GOVERNOR IS SUING CITIES THAT ARE THAT ARE NOT PRFORMING TO THEIR STANDARDS WHICH HURTS RIGHT BUT IT TAKES MORE. IT JUST TAKES ONE SORRY YOU BROUGHT IT UP. I READ IT SO I MEAN THERE ARE TEETH RIGHT THERE ARE YOU THERE ARE THERE ARE TEETH -- WE WOULD HOPE THAT. WE WOULD NEED TO USE THEM AND I KNOW IN MY DISTRICT THIS WAS A BILL THAT THAT ACTUALLY MY CONSTITUENTS AND SOME OF MY CITIES ACTUALLY ASKED TO HAVE PUT IN PLACE -- BECAUSE THEY WANT TO PARTICIPATE AND I THINK THAT FOR US LIKE THE PROFESSOR SAID ESPECIALLY LOS ANGELES WERE WERE IN IN CRISIS MODE. AND WE HAVE TO UTILIZE EVERY TOOL IN OUR TOOL SHED AND NOW THAT I KNOW ABOUT SB TO TRUST ME I WILL CHECK WITH MY CITIES AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE PARTICIPATING IN THE WAY THAT THEY SHOULD BE. ON THOSE -- YOU KNOW IT'S ON YOUR CITIES AND GOOD WORDS RANDY IS ON THE SAID OVERLY A MILE AND A HALF SQUARE. AND WHERE WE PUT IT I SO I HAVE I FIGURED OUT YEAH YOU WERE CITY AND THEN YOU CAN HELP PAY FOR THEIR RIGHT. SHOULDER AND TRY IT YEAH -- SO WHY WOULD WE NEED LEGISLATION TO DO THIS WHY THIS WE'VE GOT CITIES THAT ARE DOING IT VOLUNTARILY. WHY WOULD WE HAVE TO MANDATE? AT I THINK LIKE I THINK I MEAN I AM EVERYTHING WE JUST SAID AND WE'RE IN A CRISIS MODE AND UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO DO -- TRUST ME THE LAST THING I WANT TO DO RIGHT NOW IS BRING YOU A BILL WHERE PEOPLE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO TO A PARKING LOT TO TO BE SAFE AND TO HAVE A PLACE TO SLEEP. IT'S THE LAST BILL OF ALL THE THINGS WE DO HERE THAT I WANT TO I NEED TO DO. BUT PEOPLE NEED A SAFE PLACE TO STAY AND RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING IN THEIR CARS ESPECIALLY IN THE SOME OF THE CITIES THAT I REPRESENT. AND IF THE CITIES AND ALL CITIES ARE DOING IT LIKE YOU JUST SAID THE EVEN THE ONES THAT ARE MANDATE AREN'T DOING I IF I CAN PUT THESE ARE THE TEETH. IF I CAN PUT TEETH INTO THE IDEA THAT WE NEED TO CREATE A SPACE THAT NOT ONLY GIVES PEOPLE A SAFE PLACE TO PARK SO THAT THEY CAN SLEEP AT NIGHT. BUT ON TOP OF THAT CONNECTS THEM WITH SOCIAL SERVICES THEN I'VE DONE MY JOB A LITTLE PIECE OF MY JOB TO DEAL WITH A CREW CRISIS SITUATION THAT WE ARE AND SO THAT WOULD BE MY ANSWER THE MANAGER AT OR THAT WORKS HERE MATH BUT I THINK THAT YOU'VE. ALSO. BEEN TRYING TO BE FLEXIBLE RIGHT -- ABSOLUTELY HE'S -- ABSOLUTELY IN YOUR ALSO FOCUSING ON WHERE WE HAVE THE MOST ACUTE CHALLENGE YES LARGEST COUNTIES. IN THE CITY CALIFORNIA WORKING ON A LOCAL FLEXIBILITY WHICH YOU KNOW EVERYONE APPRECIATES. AND THE FACT THAT WE ACTUALLY NEED TO GET THIS THING DONE YES THANK YOU AND YES I AGREE WITH THE CHAIR. WHICH REALLY THAT NO THAT'S TRUE I TOTALLY AGREE WE ARE AT A CRISIS POINT AND WE NEED TO BE ABLE AND I THINK IT'S NOT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH RIGHT. SO WE'RE GONNA NEED -- THAT'S WHY WE'RE INVEST IN THE TWO BILLION IN. FRONT OF COMMERCE HOUSING WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY NEEDED AS WE ARE GONNA SEEN TEN BILLION OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS AND HOMELESS AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING MOVING FORWARD AND WE NEED PROGRAMS JUST LIKE THIS IS A SMALL PIECE THIS IS A PIECE BY THINK MUCH MORE THAN THAT. I MEAN IT'S BUT IT'S IT'S A CRITICAL PIECE THAT WE NEED TO MOVE FORWARD WITH. PLEASE VICE CHAIR AND THEN I KNOW CENTER ABOUT I JUST THINK IT'S IT'S SUCH CRITICAL DISCUSSION -- BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY WERE WERE IMPOSING ON LOCALITIES WHICH YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN HAVING THAT BATTLE ALL YEAR IS ALWAYS AYE ALL EVERY YEAR YEAH -- BUT I'M JUST WONDERING IF SB TWO ZONES WOULD BE A GOOD PLACE TO PARK CARS. TO GET THE CITY'S GOING AS I WONDER THERE'S A MERGER HEAR ME COULD BE BUT I THINK ANY EXAMPLE LIKE IN CINEMA COUNTY SO WE THAT THAT THE BEST AREA THAT WE FOUND IS THAT A FAIR GROUNDS SO WE HAVE -- COLD WEATHER PARKING. FOR FIVE AND A HALF MONTHS OUT OF THE YEAR WE CONTRACT WITH CATHOLIC CHARITIES -- WARM SHOWERS ONE HOT MEAL A DAY AND RESTROOMS IN A SAFE PLACE TO BE ABLE TO PARK -- IN SO THAT DID. AND I DON'T EVER WANT TO ASSUME OR PUT WORDS IN THE GERMS MATH I THINK WITH THIS BILLS PROVIDING IS AN OPPORTUNITY ONE SAYING THE LOCALITIES Y'ALL GONNA MOVE YOU GOT TO MOVE ON THIS. AND WHERE YOU PUT THAT. ULTIMATELY IT'S GOING TO BE YOUR DECISION EARLY AND I THINK THAT'S THE PIECE WOW YES THERE WOULD BE -- SOME STICK TO THIS IT IS ALSO PROVIDE AN INCREDIBLE FLEXIBILITY SO THAT LOCALS THE ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH THE LOCALS HATE. ON IS NONEXISTENT IN THIS IT IT PROVIDES FLEXIBLY WHERE THEY THINK ARE THE BEST PLACE TO BE ABLE TO HOUSE SERVICES LIKE THAT WOULD BE. YES AT ANY. THE CHAIR KNOWS ME VERY WELL. I'M NOT SEEING A LONG LIST OF OPPOSITION. SITTING HERE JUST TRYING TO YEAH. I UNDERSTAND [inaudible] GO. EXCELLENT SO WE'RE GONNA THINK RICHARD THANK YOU THANK YOU NO I IS RIGHT HERE WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND I THINK YOU. I'M TRYING TO GET MY MY INTAKE PROFESSOR FOR CAM K&lt;c.cyan&gt;.&lt;/c&gt; WHAT ARE THE LEAST? HAVE YOU TALK. NO IT'S IT'S TRUE IN AT THANK YOU VERY MUCH AS VESTER TO THE SUPPORT IN BEHALF CONVERSATION AND BRING TO LIGHT SO -- IN LOVE THE VICE CHAIR AND SO GRATEFUL. THAT HE IS -- IS HE IS HERE SO MY GOODNESS THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'RE GONNA GO. TO CENTER BELL AND THEN IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THIS PRESENTATION I DO BELIEVE THAT -- CENTER HER TITLE HAS SOMETHING TO BE ABLE TO GIVE OUT HERE TODAY -- AS WELL CENTER WINNER SO -- WE'RE INTRODUCING ABOUT LOT OF MY TIME IN MY COMMITTEE THE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE. AND IT'S INVOLVING -- ANOTHER BUILDING UP FROM THE ASSEMBLY. THAT DEALS WITH -- PARKING. IN THE CITY FOR HOMELESS. AND THAT'S TRUE BILL IT'S RELATED -- TO TRYING -- TO ACCOMMODATE -- HOMELESS PEOPLE PARKING IN THE CITY AND GIVING THEM A LITTLE MORE TIME. TO PARK HAVE [inaudible] HAVE -- AND THEN WE HAVE THE LEGAL CITIES WE HAVE LOS ANGELES. ALL THE OTHER CITIES -- OPPOSING THE BILL. THEY DON'T WANT TO HAVE RESTRICTIONS. ON THEIR ABILITY TO BOOT. IF TECH AIDS. WILL PEOPLE ON SO FORD HAS HAS THIS BILL -- LOOKED AT THAT BILL AND HAVE YOU LOOKED AT THAT BILL AS A COMPLEMENTARY -- TO WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO. IN HONESTLY THAT'S WHAT CITIES ARE DOING RIGHT I KNOW AND I I'M AWARE OF THE BILL BUT NO WE HAVEN'T LOOKED AT IT AT WE HAVEN'T LOOKED AT IT IS COMPLEMENTARY OR OR OR ANYTHING WE I MEAN. FOR US. I THINK THAT YOU KNOW I KNOW CITIES HAVE AN ISSUE A LONG LIST OF ISSUES WITH THAT AND AND OUR OUR OUR OUR LIKE THE CHAIR MENTIONED I THINK OUR HOPE WAS TO CREATE SOME FLEXIBILITY SO THAT THERE WASN'T THAT SAME OPPOSITION AND I THINK YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THAT. SAME OPPOSITION OR HAVE FROM THEM OR SIGNED A DEAL WITH THE POLICE ENFORCEMENT POWERS THAT WERE JUST GO IN AND IN EARLY WE WERE THINKING MAYBE -- AWAY RATHER THAN GIVE A TICKET -- GE IMPOUNDED CAR. THEY CAN GIVE A INFORMATION ABOUT A CITY PARKING AREA THAT WAS ONE OF THE SUGGESTIONS. RIGHT WE'RE ALSO STILL GIVING A LOT OF TICKETS AND RAIN OPPOSING A LOT OF FINANCIAL. BURDEN ON SOMEBODY'S ALREADY HOMELESS. GIVE THEM -- HELP THEM FIND A LOCATION WHERE THEY CAN'T WORK. BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THERE'S ALWAYS PEOPLE THAT ARE. GETTING YOU KNOW THEY'RE OUT THERE GETTING A LOT OF TICKETS. AND I HEARD IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY THERE WAS SOMEBODY GAVE ME A NUMBER A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND TICKETS A YEAR. ON THIS KIND OF THING NAY [inaudible] SO SO. YES I KNOW IT DEALS WITH -- A POVERTY TAX IS KIND OF LIKE A PROPERTY TAX OF YOUR WRITING WHILST ACTS YEAH RIGHT -- THAT THEY PAY IN EFFECT YOU KNOW. SO. WHAT KIND OF MAGNITUDE YOU THINK YOU NEED TO HAVE WITH THOSE? PARKING PROGRAM HOW BIG SHOULD I MANY. PLACES THAT YOU ESTIMATE ARE NEEDED TERMS OF A DEMAND THAT WE HAVE. I MEAN. LOOK AT DOWN. I MEAN I CAN ONLY SPEAK TO LA COUNTY AND I KNOW THAT BOTH THE COUNTY OF LOOK AT SOME OTHER UNINCORPORATED AREAS THE CITY OF AUSTIN'S WOULDN'T SOME OF THEIR AREAS AND AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE CURRENTLY LIVING IN THEIR CARS AND LA COUNTY IS. AROUND. TWENTY THOUSAND AND SO THAT'S NOT TWENTY THOUSAND CARS BUT IT'S TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE SO PEOPLE HAVE IDENTIFIED SUFFICIENT SITES. TO FILL THAT PARTICULAR DEMAND BUT THEN YOU HAVE TO DECIDE HOW TO IMPLEMENT ITS AND AND WHAT'S NICE ABOUT THIS BILL FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. IS THAT IT PROVIDES KIND OF THE IMPETUS TO DO A EMERGENCY PLAN FOR HOMELESSNESS AS IT RELATES TO PARKING. AND IT DOESN'T SAY YOU HAVE TO DO IT THIS WAY OR THAT WAY BUT YOU CAN DO IT WITH IN THAT THE SORT OF RESOURCES YOU HAVE BUT AGAIN 200-00 PEOPLE IN LA COUNTY. AND THEN YOU CAN THINK ABOUT THAT RATIO IN OTHER PLACES AS WE'VE SEEN THE HOMELESS NUMBERS GO UP IT IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S A PART OF THE SOLUTION THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE IN THE SHORT RUN HERE [inaudible] OKAY -- SO I THINK I THINK THE BILL'S COULD BE. MADE COMPLIMENTARY AROUND AYE THAT'S SORT OF WHAT I'M THINKING. AS I REVIEW THE BILL FOR NEXT WEEK'S HEARING ON THE BILL SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE WHAT WE'RE DOING AND ARE COMMITTEE. SO I I I LOVE TO HAVE YOUR TALK TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT -- TO SEE IF THE YOU HAVE SOME GREAT IDEAS ON HOW TO DO THAT. THANK YOU SO MUCH RIGHT AWAY I HAVE ANOTHER THING I WANT TO TELL YOU. I HAVE -- WHEN I TEN YEARS AGO I HAD THIS SEVENTY YEAR OLD? THAT WAS A FOSTER -- INTERJ HE WAS -- FOSTER KID THAT WAS INTERNING IN MY OFFICE. HE'S HE WAS SEVENTEEN THEY WENT THROUGH A LOT OF BAD THINGS WHEN HE WAS A KID. NOW IN THE PRICE SCHOOL GUINNESS PHD [inaudible] ALSO. I JUST WANT TO LET EVERYBODY KNOW THAT SO THERE'S DO GREAT THINGS THERE. THANK YOU SO MUCH CENTER VERY GRATEFUL. I WOULD LIKE TO RETURN OR THE MAJORITY LEADER AND I JUST WANNA DO A QUICK NOTE. MAJORITY LEADER SUPPOSED TO BE ON A PLANE IN JUST A BIT AND WE'RE DOING WELL THAT ONE SO AT THE LEADER. OF THE MAKE IT VERY FAST YOU KNOW I HAVE A BILL ON THE STREET -- COURSE IDEA BUT BUT ON YOU KNOW I GOTTA TELL YOU SOMETHING. WE GOT A CHANGE OF THE GAME. THIS BILL REQUIRES BY JANUARY FIRST. TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TWO IT. SHOULD BE DONE LAST WEEK OKAY IT'S IT'S JUST ENOUGH ARE GONNA VOTE FOR THIS THING. BUT I WANT TO CHANGE THE DATE I WANT TO MAKE IT TWO THOUSAND DODGE YOU KNOW WHATEVER IT IS THE DE DID MAKE ENERGY BILL WHATEVER WE GOT TO DO. WE GOT JUST EXTRAORDINARY CHALLENGE AND WE IN GOVERNMENT ARE JUST WORKING TOO SLOW ON THIS STUFF. AND IT'S JUST NOT RIGHT AND AND GIVEN PEOPLE AND I I DON'T CARE IF PEOPLE UNCOMFORTABLE EVERYBODY ELSE IS UNCOMFORTABLE THE PROBLEM IS HORRIBLE IT'S HAVE AN EFFECT ON EVERYBODY. SO THIS YOU KNOW THIS NOTION OF PUTTING THIS IN EFFECT BY JANUARY FIRST TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TWO TO ME. YOU KNOW ALL VOTE FOR TODAY BUT I MIGHT STAND UP ON THE FLOOR AND MAKE A RUCKUS ABOUT IT BECAUSE THEY SHOULD BE. JANUARY FIRST TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY OR MAKE AN URGENCY BILL AND GET THE STUFF ROLAND BUT WE WE ALL OF US THROUGHOUT THE CITY CALIFORNIA HAVE TO TAKE IT UNBELIEVABLE HAVE A SENSE OF URGENCY ABOUT THIS. AND I I THINK WE HAD A CHANGE OF THE GAME AND I THINK TOO MANY PEOPLE. WHO ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE MECHANICS OF STUFF ARE ARE ARE CONTROLLING THE TED TO DO THEY SAY THE TAIL IS WAGGING THE DOG OR WHATEVER? WE GOT A CHANGE OF THE GAME BECAUSE ARE THE PEOPLE ALL AROUND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA EVERY CORNER BALL FIFTY COUNTIES RIPS AT WITH THAT A MOVE THE BILL. THANK YOU IN MOTION FOR IN TURN OVER CENTER WINNER -- GREAT THANK YOU -- SUPPORT THE BILL I DON'T I DON'T MY ONLY CRITIQUE OF IT IS I WISH IT UP BY THE CITY'S INCOMES UNDER THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND I KNOW THAT. THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS IS A COMPROMISE PROCESS. ARE BY NATURE AND FRANKLY -- HOMELESS PEOPLE NEED A SAFE PLACE TO SLEEP AND THE SMALLEST CITIES DECIDED TO IN THE BIGGEST CITIES BUT I UNDERSTAND THE DYNAMIC IN THIS BUILDING. THAT SMALL CITIES SOMEONE'S GOT EXEMPTED -- SO. I THINK IT'S IN TERMS OF THE SB TWO IS ON THE PHONE A COMMENT TOTALLY BROKEN YES THE TWO ZONES AND CITIES PUT IT OUT. YOU KNOW FAR AWAY DISCONNECTED FROM EVERYTHING WE'RE TRYING TO TIGHTEN THAT UP THIS YEAR SO HOPEFULLY WE'LL HAVE A BETTER SB TO SITUATION. SO THAT WE HAVE MORE SHELTER IN MORE PARTS OF THE STATE. BUT I ALSO JUST LOOKING BIG PICTURE I KNOW -- I SOME MEMORY THAT YOU FULLY AGREE WITH ME ON THAT -- THAT -- I TOO I SHARE WITH CENTER HERTZBERG ON DESIRE TO HAVE MORE OF A SENSE OF URGENCY -- IN THIS BILL IN THIS BUILDING. AND THAT URGENCY SHOULD EXTEND -- TO THE NEED FOR A DRAMATIC INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF ACTUAL HOUSING. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BECAUSE BECAUSE YEAH. BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE THE THAT'S LOOKING BIG PICTURE HERE. YES YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE YOU KNOW ARE ALREADY LIVING IN THEIR CARS WE JUST WANT TO SAY PLACE FROM THE BUT JUST STEPPING BACK. AND LOOKING BIG PICTURE. THE MORAL FAILURE THAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING IN THIS STATE BECAUSE WE ARE FORCING PEOPLE TO LIVE IN THEIR CARS. WHAT KIND OF SOCIETY? FORCES PEOPLE TO LIVE IN THEIR CARS. I AND WE HAVE DONE SO NOT BECAUSE SOMETHING HAPPENED TO US WE'VE DONE THIS TO OURSELVES. BY MAKING IT HARDER AND HARDER AND HARDER. TO HAVE ENOUGH HOUSING. BY GENERATING THIS THREE AND A HALF MILLION HOME DEFICIT. BECAUSE WE BANNED APARTMENT BUILDINGS WITH BAND AFFORDABLE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND A LARGE MAJORITY OF THE STATE WE HAVE SAID IT'S GOING TO TAKE YEARS AND YEARS TO GET ANY KIND OF HOUSING. APPROVED. AND WE ARE GOING TO CREATE THE SHORTAGE AND THAT'S WHAT CALIFORNIA HAS EFFECTIVELY DONE OVER YEAR OVER THE YEARS. AND YOU KNOW SOME OF THE CITY THAT WE TALKED ABOUT TODAY. ALSO ARE IN THE HABIT OF OPPOSING ANY EFFORT TO SET STATE STANDARDS TO SAY YOU NEED TO BUILD ENOUGH HOUSING. SO YES LET'S DO THIS LET'S HAVE THE PEOPLE LIVING IN CARS. IBM SEE FOR AN ENVIRONMENT. BOAT WE WE HAVE TO KEEP. IT FRONT AND CENTER THAT THIS IS THIS REPRESENTS A FAILURE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND WE HAVE TO AGGRESSIVELY BUILD ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF HOUSING EVERYWHERE IN THE STATE -- BECAUSE THAT'S DOT SO HUMANE THING TO DO IT'S THE COMPASSION AND PROGRESSIVE THING TO DO -- AND JUST LAST HAS NEVER LOSE SIGHT OF THAT. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND WE ARE STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHEN YOU SEE SOME SMALL CITIES WERE EXEMPTED I THINK ALL CITIES WERE IN BUT ANYWAY WE CAN TALK MORE ABOUT THAT'S GOOD TAX -- NO NO NO YEAH. OKAY I WAS LOOKING IN ANY AND ROLL MY EYES I SEE THERE YOU GO. THIS BILL AND THERE IS YEAH. YEAH YEAH YEAH. ALL RIGHT THIS GO TO THE VICE CHAIR. OBSERVATION -- BECAUSE WE ALL GO OUT AND SPEAK IN. HAD ONE RATHER SUBSTANTIAL INDIVIDUAL THAT I'VE GOT AN IDEA ON HOMELESSNESS AND AND AND HIS IDEA WAS THAT THERE A LOT OF US PARKING STRUCTURES BUT THAT MILLION ORANGE COUNTY BUT IN. CERTAIN LITTLE POCKETS. HE SAID THEY GOT THEY GOT. FLOORS THAT ARE NOT BEING USED FOR PARKING SPACE AND MAYBE WE OUGHT. TO USE SOME OF THOSE EVEN FOR THE YOU KNOW PUTTING IN UNITS THERE ARE SOME SOME PARTITION. THAT MIGHT BE A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR SAY A CITY LIKE SAN FRANCISCO THAT. DOESN'T HAVE A LOT OF BILLABLE SPACE BUT MAYBE HAS A LOT OF PARKING STRUCTURE WILL. OR HUNTINGTON BEACH. BUT IT'S INTERESTING THE IDEA IS A COMMON SO THANK YOU THE PERSON.
