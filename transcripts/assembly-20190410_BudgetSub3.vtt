THING THAT'S HANGING OUT THERE

00:36:08.833 --> 00:36:12.236
FOR ME -- AND I DON'T THINK

00:36:12.303 --> 00:36:14.438
THEY'RE GONNA NEED ME SO THAT'LL

00:36:14.505 --> 00:36:16.841
BE OKAY -- WE DO NOT HAVE A

ONLY PRESENTATION ON ACTIVE

00:36:30.454 --> 00:36:32.623
TRANSPORTATION I THINK WE OUGHTA --

00:36:32.690 --> 00:36:44.902
BEGIN WITH THAT.

00:36:44.969 --> 00:36:46.737
AND I THINK -- WE'RE PLANNING ON

00:36:46.804 --> 00:36:47.939

PRESENTATION IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN

00:36:51.842 --> 00:36:53.778
WHY DON'T WE GO AHEAD.

00:36:53.844 --> 00:36:54.812

00:36:57.949 --> 00:36:59.717
I'M AS THOUGH WE I'M GOING TO

00:36:59.784 --> 00:37:01.385
JUST MAKE A BRIEF FOR VERBAL

00:37:01.452 --> 00:37:03.154
PRESENTATION TO YOU OUR OFFICE

00:37:03.221 --> 00:37:05.456
I'M RELEASED A REVIEW OF THE

00:37:05.523 --> 00:37:06.991
STATE'S ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION

00:37:07.058 --> 00:37:08.793
PROGRAM A REPORT -- AT THE

00:37:08.859 --> 00:37:11.896
BEGINNING OF MARCH -- AS PART OF

00:37:11.963 --> 00:37:14.398
THE CURRENT YEAR BUDGET PACKAGE

00:37:14.465 --> 00:37:15.700
THE SUPPLEMENT ALL.

00:37:15.766 --> 00:37:17.368
LANGUAGE REPORT DIRECTED OUR

00:37:17.435 --> 00:37:19.503
OFFICE TO REVIEW THE ACTIVE

00:37:19.570 --> 00:37:21.405
TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM -- AND

00:37:21.472 --> 00:37:23.541
PRESENT SOME FINDINGS TO THE

00:37:23.608 --> 00:37:25.209
LEGISLATURE ON THE TYPES OF

00:37:25.276 --> 00:37:26.911
PROJECTS THAT ARE BEING FUNDED.

00:37:26.978 --> 00:37:28.079
THE BENEFITS FROM THOSE PROJECTS

00:37:28.145 --> 00:37:29.146
AS WELL AS TO MAKE

00:37:29.213 --> 00:37:31.749
RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPROVE THE

00:37:31.816 --> 00:37:33.017
EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROGRAM.

00:37:33.084 --> 00:37:34.418
I'M JUST A A LITTLE BIT OF

00:37:34.485 --> 00:37:35.720
BACKGROUND AND THE PROGRAM WAS

00:37:35.786 --> 00:37:38.723
CREATED IN THE THIRTEEN FOURTEEN

00:37:38.789 --> 00:37:40.358
BUDGET AND PACKAGE HAND

00:37:40.424 --> 00:37:41.859
CONSOLIDATED SEVERAL SMALLER

00:37:41.926 --> 00:37:44.195
ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS --

00:37:44.261 --> 00:37:46.330
INTO ONE A LARGER PROGRAM THAT

00:37:46.397 --> 00:37:47.498
HAD ABOUT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY

00:37:47.565 --> 00:37:51.002
MILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDING AT

00:37:51.068 --> 00:37:52.236
THAT TIME -- FOR AND THE REASON

00:37:52.303 --> 00:37:53.004
AT THAT THE PROGRAM WAS CREATED

00:37:53.070 --> 00:37:54.405
IN CONSOLIDATING THE SMALLER

00:37:54.472 --> 00:37:56.173
ACCOUNTS -- WAS REALLY TO

00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:58.309
PROVIDE GREATER FOCUS ON ACTIVE

00:37:58.376 --> 00:37:59.477
TRANSPORTATION AS A MODE OF

00:37:59.543 --> 00:38:01.345
TRANSPORTATION AS WELL AS TO

00:38:01.412 --> 00:38:03.948
PROVIDE -- AT MORE OF A A STATE

00:38:04.015 --> 00:38:05.916
ROLE IN SETTING PRIORITIES FOR

00:38:05.983 --> 00:38:07.418
ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION WITHIN THE

00:38:07.485 --> 00:38:08.252
STATE.

00:38:08.319 --> 00:38:10.054
SO IT HAD BEEN ABOUT FIVE YEARS

00:38:10.121 --> 00:38:10.621
SINCE THE CREATION OF THE

00:38:10.688 --> 00:38:11.989
PROGRAM AND SO THAT WAS SORT OF

00:38:12.056 --> 00:38:14.191
IMPETUS -- FOR INCLUDING IN THE

00:38:14.258 --> 00:38:15.593
CURRENT YEAR BUDGET PACKAGE THE

00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:17.094
REQUEST OUR OFFICE -- OR THE

00:38:17.161 --> 00:38:19.730
DIRECTION TO OUR OFFICE TO TO

00:38:19.797 --> 00:38:20.965
REVIEW THE PROGRAM.

00:38:21.032 --> 00:38:23.434
SO WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT IN THE

00:38:23.501 --> 00:38:24.502
FIVE YEARS SINCE THE PROGRAM HAS

00:38:24.568 --> 00:38:27.805
BEEN IN PLACE THERE HAVE BEEN --

00:38:27.872 --> 00:38:29.306
SEVEN HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX

00:38:29.373 --> 00:38:30.574
DIFFERENT PROJECTS THAT HAVE

00:38:30.641 --> 00:38:32.610
RECEIVED SOME FUNDING FROM THE

00:38:32.677 --> 00:38:34.078
ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM

00:38:34.145 --> 00:38:35.413
AND THIS IS BEEN THROUGH VARIOUS --

00:38:35.479 --> 00:38:37.815
FUNDING CYCLES WHERE THE

00:38:37.882 --> 00:38:39.583
TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION WILL

00:38:39.650 --> 00:38:41.285
PUT OUT A CALL FOR PROJECTS --

00:38:41.352 --> 00:38:42.820
AND AND FUND PROJECTS IN A

00:38:42.887 --> 00:38:45.189
CERTAIN DOLLAR AMOUNT BASED ON

00:38:45.256 --> 00:38:45.723
THE FUNDING THAT THEY HAVE

00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:46.524
AVAILABLE.

00:38:46.590 --> 00:38:49.427
AND 75% OF THOSE PROJECTS ARE

00:38:49.493 --> 00:38:51.095
FOR INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS

00:38:51.162 --> 00:38:52.163
THESE TEND TO BE SMALLER

00:38:52.229 --> 00:38:53.898
INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS SO I'M

00:38:53.964 --> 00:38:55.433
PUTTING IN A BY CLEAN.

00:38:55.499 --> 00:38:58.636
OR A BICYCLE PATH AND BUILDING

00:38:58.703 --> 00:39:00.771
SIDEWALKS OR INSTALLING

00:39:00.838 --> 00:39:03.074
CROSSWALKS ARE OTHER PEDESTRIAN

00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:05.509
SAFETY TYPES OF FEATURES -- BUT

00:39:05.576 --> 00:39:06.177
BUT STILL INFRASTRUCTURE

00:39:06.243 --> 00:39:08.112
PROJECTS THAT THE REMAINING

00:39:08.179 --> 00:39:10.648
PROJECTS TEND TO BE FOR PLANNING

00:39:10.715 --> 00:39:13.050
AND AND AND THINGS LIKE THAT.

00:39:13.117 --> 00:39:14.919
SO WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT AND SO

00:39:14.985 --> 00:39:16.087
THERE'S THERE'S THREE DIFFERENT

00:39:16.153 --> 00:39:17.288
COMPONENTS TO THE PROGRAM AND

00:39:17.354 --> 00:39:19.356
THERE'S A STATE COMPONENT WHICH

00:39:19.423 --> 00:39:21.092
GETS 50% OF THE FUNDING.

00:39:21.158 --> 00:39:22.326
THERE IS THAT METROPOLITAN

00:39:22.393 --> 00:39:24.028
PLANNING ORGANIZATION OR MPO

00:39:24.095 --> 00:39:25.463
COMPONENT THAT RECEIVES 40% OF

00:39:25.529 --> 00:39:27.498
THE FUNDING AND THERE'S 10% OF

00:39:27.565 --> 00:39:28.899
THE FUNDING GOES TO THE SMALL

00:39:28.966 --> 00:39:30.634
URBAN AND RURAL REGIONS OF THE

00:39:30.701 --> 00:39:31.435
STATE.

00:39:31.502 --> 00:39:32.970
AND SO WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT

00:39:33.037 --> 00:39:34.038
EACH OF THOSE THREE PROGRAM

00:39:34.105 --> 00:39:35.439
COMPONENTS TEND TO BE FUNDING

00:39:35.506 --> 00:39:37.308
THE SAME TYPES OF PROJECTS --

00:39:37.374 --> 00:39:38.743
VERY SIMILAR TYPES OF PROJECTS

00:39:38.809 --> 00:39:41.145
VERY SIMILAR -- DOLLARS SIZE OF

00:39:41.212 --> 00:39:43.047
THE PROJECTS.

00:39:43.114 --> 00:39:44.715
I WE ALSO FOUND THAT THE WHILE

00:39:44.782 --> 00:39:45.816
THE PROJECTS ARE.

00:39:45.883 --> 00:39:48.152
GENERALLY VERY SMALL AND PUTTING

00:39:48.219 --> 00:39:49.787
IN A SIDEWALK OR INSTALLING AT A

00:39:49.854 --> 00:39:51.155
BIKE LANE IS NOT TYPICALLY A A

00:39:51.222 --> 00:39:52.556
HUGE DOLLAR COST COMPARED TO

00:39:52.623 --> 00:39:54.225
OTHER TYPES OF TRANSPORTATION

00:39:54.291 --> 00:39:55.760
INFRASTRUCTURE -- BUT THESE

00:39:55.826 --> 00:39:57.495
PROJECT DO APPEAR TO BE GETTING

00:39:57.561 --> 00:39:59.997
BIGGER OVER TIME -- ONE OF THE

00:40:00.064 --> 00:40:01.532
IDEAS WHEN ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION

00:40:01.599 --> 00:40:03.934
PROGRAM WAS CREATED IS THAT --

00:40:04.001 --> 00:40:05.236
PULLING THE FUNDS TOGETHER WOULD

00:40:05.302 --> 00:40:07.505
ALLOW POTENTIALLY ALLOW FOR MORE

00:40:07.571 --> 00:40:09.406
LARGER MORE TRANSFORMATIVE TYPES

00:40:09.473 --> 00:40:10.808
OF ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION

00:40:10.875 --> 00:40:13.377
PROJECTS THAT WOULD REALLY --

00:40:13.444 --> 00:40:15.346
CREATE ENOUGH OF A OF THE

00:40:15.412 --> 00:40:17.214
INFRASTRUCTURE IN AN AREA TO

00:40:17.281 --> 00:40:19.016
ALLOW FOR A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT

00:40:19.083 --> 00:40:19.784
OF MODE SHIFT TO HAVE MORE

00:40:19.850 --> 00:40:22.253
PEOPLE WALKING AND BIKING AND SO

00:40:22.319 --> 00:40:23.053
AS YOU SEE SOME OF THESE

00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:24.388
PROJECTS GETTING LARGER AND

00:40:24.455 --> 00:40:25.556
LARGER OVER TIME.

00:40:25.623 --> 00:40:26.891
IT COULD BE REPRESENTATIVE OF

00:40:26.957 --> 00:40:28.993
PROJECTS TRENDING TOWARDS BEING

00:40:29.059 --> 00:40:30.594
THE ISN'T LARGER MORE

00:40:30.661 --> 00:40:31.896
TRANSFORMATIVE PROJECTS.

00:40:31.962 --> 00:40:33.764
AND WE'RE SEEING THAT ACROSS THE

00:40:33.831 --> 00:40:34.265
THREE DIFFERENT PROGRAM

00:40:34.331 --> 00:40:36.100
COMPONENTS SO NOT ONLY THE

00:40:36.167 --> 00:40:38.269
STATEWIDE COMPONENT BUT ALSO THE

00:40:38.335 --> 00:40:42.006
MPO AND THE SMALL URBAN AND

00:40:42.072 --> 00:40:42.807
RURAL COMPONENT.

00:40:42.873 --> 00:40:43.841
I'M ANOTHER THING THAT WE WERE

00:40:43.908 --> 00:40:44.775
ASKED TO LOOK AT IS WHAT

00:40:44.842 --> 00:40:46.177
BENEFITS THESE PROJECTS ARE

00:40:46.243 --> 00:40:47.845
ACHIEVING IN THE PROGRAM OVERALL

00:40:47.912 --> 00:40:49.113
IS ACHIEVING.

00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:50.781
SO OBVIOUSLY A PRIMARY GOAL OF

00:40:50.848 --> 00:40:51.749
THE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION

00:40:51.816 --> 00:40:53.417
PROGRAM IS TO INCREASE WALKING

00:40:53.484 --> 00:40:56.153
AND BIKING I'M UNFORTUNATELY THE

00:40:56.220 --> 00:40:58.556
DATA IS NOT BEING COLLECTED ON

00:40:58.622 --> 00:41:00.558
THESE OUTCOMES -- FOR THESE

00:41:00.624 --> 00:41:02.159
PROJECTS IN SUCH A WAY THAT IT'S

00:41:02.226 --> 00:41:03.861
USABLE THERE SOME DATA BEING

00:41:03.928 --> 00:41:05.563
COLLECTED BY THE WAY IT'S BEING

00:41:05.629 --> 00:41:07.031
COLLECTED AND THE TIMING OF HOW

00:41:07.097 --> 00:41:08.732
THE DATA IS BEING COLLECTED.

00:41:08.799 --> 00:41:10.568
REALLY WE FOUND MAKING IT YOU

00:41:10.634 --> 00:41:13.103
CAN'T REALLY PULL ANY MEANINGFUL

00:41:13.170 --> 00:41:14.438
AN OUTCOME.

00:41:14.505 --> 00:41:15.706
MEASURES ARE INSIGHTS FROM THAT

00:41:15.773 --> 00:41:17.374
DATA AND SO IT'S REALLY UNCLEAR

00:41:17.441 --> 00:41:19.176
AT THIS POINT WHETHER OR WALKING

00:41:19.243 --> 00:41:22.213
AND BICYCLING IS ACTUALLY BEING

00:41:22.279 --> 00:41:23.547
INCREASED BY THE PROGRAM.

00:41:23.614 --> 00:41:25.282
ANOTHER OUTCOME THAT WE FOUND --

00:41:25.349 --> 00:41:27.318
AND WERE ASKED TO LOOK AT IS ON

00:41:27.384 --> 00:41:28.485
THE ON THE IMPACT ON

00:41:28.552 --> 00:41:29.787
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES.

00:41:29.854 --> 00:41:31.121
SO WE DID FIND THAT MOST

00:41:31.188 --> 00:41:32.189
PROJECTS ARE BENEFITING A

00:41:32.256 --> 00:41:33.724
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY IN SOME

00:41:33.791 --> 00:41:35.492
WAY -- THAT COULD BE THE PROJECT

00:41:35.559 --> 00:41:36.660
IS WITHIN A DISADVANTAGED

00:41:36.727 --> 00:41:38.195
COMMUNITY OR IT COULD BE OUTSIDE

00:41:38.262 --> 00:41:39.897
OF A DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY BUT

00:41:39.964 --> 00:41:42.099
HAS SOME -- LINKAGE OR BENEFIT

00:41:42.166 --> 00:41:44.168
TO THAT COMMUNITY BY MAYBE

00:41:44.235 --> 00:41:44.702
PROVIDING A CONNECTION OR

00:41:44.768 --> 00:41:47.771
SOMETHING -- AND SO 88% OF THE

00:41:47.838 --> 00:41:49.306
PROJECTS HAD SOME SORT OF

00:41:49.373 --> 00:41:50.875
BENEFIT TO A DISADVANTAGED

00:41:50.941 --> 00:41:53.110
COMMUNITY -- WE ALSO KNOW THAT

00:41:53.177 --> 00:41:55.079
IN ADDITION TO THE PROJECT CAN

00:41:55.145 --> 00:41:56.780
BE OUTSIDE OF A DISADVANTAGED

00:41:56.847 --> 00:41:57.681
COMMUNITY BENEFIT.

00:41:57.748 --> 00:41:59.450
THE AND THE WAY THAT

00:41:59.516 --> 00:42:01.385
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY HAS BEEN

00:42:01.452 --> 00:42:03.854
DEFINED HAS CHANGED SOMEWHAT

00:42:03.921 --> 00:42:05.389
THROUGHOUT SINCE THE BEGINNING

00:42:05.456 --> 00:42:07.157
OF THE PROGRAM WITHOUT EACH SORT

00:42:07.224 --> 00:42:08.459
OF INTEGRATION OUT OF THE

00:42:08.525 --> 00:42:09.960
TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION'S.

00:42:10.027 --> 00:42:11.996
DEVELOPMENT OF GUIDELINES ON AND

00:42:12.062 --> 00:42:13.397
IN SOME CASES HAS HAS BEEN

00:42:13.464 --> 00:42:15.366
BROUGHT AND AND SO HAVING A

00:42:15.432 --> 00:42:16.800
SOMEWHAT BROAD MEASURE OF

00:42:16.867 --> 00:42:18.402
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY -- COULD

00:42:18.469 --> 00:42:19.837
ALSO BE ONE OF THE REASONS THAT

00:42:19.904 --> 00:42:21.238
WE'RE SEEING SUCH AS A VERY

00:42:21.305 --> 00:42:22.873
SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF THE

00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:23.574
PROJECTS.

00:42:23.641 --> 00:42:24.742
I'M HAVING A BENEFIT TO THE

00:42:24.808 --> 00:42:26.143
DISCIPLINE COMMITTEE BUT DOES

00:42:26.210 --> 00:42:30.214
APPEAR TO BE MEETING THAT GOAL

00:42:30.281 --> 00:42:30.781
FOR THE PROGRAM THAT STATURE

00:42:30.848 --> 00:42:32.182
TRICKLE.

00:42:32.249 --> 00:42:32.750
THAT THE STATUTE PROVIDES A

00:42:32.816 --> 00:42:35.319
MINIMUM OF 25% SO IT'S IT'S WELL

00:42:35.386 --> 00:42:36.887
IN EXCESS OF THAT.

00:42:36.954 --> 00:42:38.889
AS WE WERE ASKED TO LOOK

00:42:38.956 --> 00:42:40.224
SPECIFICALLY WHETHER THERE'S

00:42:40.291 --> 00:42:41.825
MAJOR BENEFITS TO THE STATE

00:42:41.892 --> 00:42:45.863
pCAN BE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION

00:42:45.930 --> 00:42:47.464
PROJECTS ON THAT BENEFIT THE

00:42:47.531 --> 00:42:48.766
STATE HIGHWAY SYSTEM WHERE YOU

00:42:48.832 --> 00:42:50.167
HAVE A STATE HIGHWAY THAT.

00:42:50.234 --> 00:42:51.435
ESSENTIALLY TURNS INTO MAIN

00:42:51.502 --> 00:42:54.138
STREET OF A OF A CITY WHEN IT'S

00:42:54.204 --> 00:42:55.873
RUNNING THROUGH IT AS A TOWN.

00:42:55.940 --> 00:42:57.808
AND WE WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY DATA

00:42:57.875 --> 00:42:59.176
AVAILABLE AT THE TIME WE

00:42:59.243 --> 00:43:01.245
PREPARED THIS REPORT TO TO

00:43:01.312 --> 00:43:01.845
FIGURE OUT HOW MANY OF THOSE

00:43:01.912 --> 00:43:04.048
PROJECTS -- BUT THEY WOULD JUST

00:43:04.114 --> 00:43:05.416
BE COMPETING FOR THE PROGRAM THE

00:43:05.482 --> 00:43:07.184
SAME AS THE OTHER PROJECTS OF

00:43:07.251 --> 00:43:08.585
THERE'S NO SPECIFIC CARVE OUT.

00:43:08.652 --> 00:43:11.155
TO BENEFIT OR NOT BENEFIT THE

00:43:11.221 --> 00:43:12.089
STATE HIGHWAY SYSTEM.

00:43:12.156 --> 00:43:13.490
I'M AND THEN WE FOUND THAT SOME

00:43:13.557 --> 00:43:14.658
OF THE OTHER GOALS AND BENEFITS

00:43:14.725 --> 00:43:16.627
I'M A SIMILAR TO THE WALKING AND

00:43:16.694 --> 00:43:17.962
BIKING ARE ARE DIFFICULT TO

00:43:18.028 --> 00:43:18.662
EVALUATE.

00:43:18.729 --> 00:43:20.998
AND DATA ON SAFETY IMPROVE

00:43:21.065 --> 00:43:22.466
OUTCOMES IS NOT AVAILABLE.

00:43:22.533 --> 00:43:23.534
ON THE SOME OF THE OTHER

00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:25.536
BENEFITS SUCH AS GHG REDUCTION

00:43:25.602 --> 00:43:27.538
OR PUBLIC HEALTH OUTCOMES ARE

00:43:27.604 --> 00:43:29.573
GENERALLY GOING TO BE DRIVEN OFF

00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:31.175
AS THE DATA AVAILABLE ON

00:43:31.241 --> 00:43:32.776
INCREASED WALKING AND BIKING --

00:43:32.843 --> 00:43:34.912
SINCE THE GHG REDUCTIONS WOULD

00:43:34.979 --> 00:43:36.981
COME FROM A MODE SHIFT OF PEOPLE

00:43:37.047 --> 00:43:38.182
WHO CHOOSE TO NO LONGER DRIVE

00:43:38.248 --> 00:43:39.416
AND INSTEAD TAKE AN ACTIVE

00:43:39.483 --> 00:43:40.684
TRANSPORTATION ABOUT.

00:43:40.751 --> 00:43:42.486
SO WITHOUT THAT DATA IT'S REALLY

00:43:42.553 --> 00:43:43.954
HARD TO TELL SOME OF THESE OTHER --

00:43:44.021 --> 00:43:45.689
SORT OF TERTIARY -- BENEFITS

00:43:45.756 --> 00:43:48.692
THAT THE PROGRAM IS INTENDED TO

00:43:48.759 --> 00:43:50.094
ACHIEVE.

00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:51.428
AB WE ARE ALSO ASKEDTO LOOK AT

00:43:51.495 --> 00:43:54.164
IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES AND

00:43:54.231 --> 00:43:55.666
PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION.

00:43:55.733 --> 00:43:57.201
SO WE FOUND THAT AND THE

00:43:57.267 --> 00:44:00.070
APPLICATION SCORING PROCESS AND

00:44:00.137 --> 00:44:02.206
THAT THE CDC HAS SAT AT I'M

00:44:02.272 --> 00:44:04.608
INTERESTED MAYBE BE SOMEWHAT

00:44:04.675 --> 00:44:07.077
DUPLICATIVE IT'S AND I'M.

00:44:07.144 --> 00:44:08.445
A QUICK REQUIRE SORT OF A A

00:44:08.512 --> 00:44:09.446
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF

00:44:09.513 --> 00:44:11.615
ADMINISTRATIVE EFFORT AND SO FOR

00:44:11.682 --> 00:44:12.750
ALL OF THE EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE

00:44:12.816 --> 00:44:14.218
THESE AND THREE SEPARATE POTS OF

00:44:14.284 --> 00:44:15.552
MONEY FOR THE PROGRAM WITH THE

00:44:15.619 --> 00:44:17.321
MPO AND THE SMALL URBAN AND

00:44:17.388 --> 00:44:18.689
RURAL POT.

00:44:18.756 --> 00:44:19.423
AS WELL AS THE STATEWIDE

00:44:19.490 --> 00:44:21.825
COMPONENT -- IT ANY PROJECT

00:44:21.892 --> 00:44:22.993
WANTING TO COMPETE FOR ANY OF

00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:24.461
THOSE THREE POTS HAS TO FIRST

00:44:24.528 --> 00:44:25.963
COMPETE IN THE STATE WIDE

00:44:26.030 --> 00:44:26.897
PROGRAM.

00:44:26.964 --> 00:44:28.332
WHICH MEANS FILLING OUT AN

00:44:28.399 --> 00:44:29.867
APPLICATION AND APPLYING TO THE

00:44:29.933 --> 00:44:31.568
CTC AND GOING THROUGH THAT

00:44:31.635 --> 00:44:33.670
PROCESS AND THEN PROJECTS THAT

00:44:33.737 --> 00:44:35.039
DON'T RECEIVE FUNDING THROUGH

00:44:35.105 --> 00:44:37.041
THAT PROCESS -- WHAT WOULD BE

00:44:37.107 --> 00:44:39.443
ELIGIBLE TO COMPETE IN THE MPO

00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:41.412
AND COMPONENT OF THE PROGRAM IF

00:44:41.478 --> 00:44:42.679
THEY'RE LOCATED WITHIN THAT

00:44:42.746 --> 00:44:45.049
REGION -- AND SO THAT THE

00:44:45.115 --> 00:44:48.218
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS AND IS IS

00:44:48.285 --> 00:44:51.155
IS PRETTY SIGNIFICANT CTC SCORES

00:44:51.221 --> 00:44:52.423
THESE PROJECTS THAT WITH OUR AND

00:44:52.489 --> 00:44:54.458
STAFF THEY ALSO USE VOLUNTEERS

00:44:54.525 --> 00:44:56.060
TO SCORE THE PROJECTS.

00:44:56.126 --> 00:44:57.861
AND THERE COULD BE SOME

00:44:57.928 --> 00:44:59.596
INCONSISTENCIES THERE THE

00:44:59.663 --> 00:45:00.998
PROCESS DOES SEEM A LITTLE BIT

00:45:01.065 --> 00:45:02.533
DUPLICATIVE AND SO JUST KEEPING

00:45:02.599 --> 00:45:03.901
THAT IN BACK OF MIND AS YOU

00:45:03.967 --> 00:45:05.569
THINK ABOUT CHANGES YOU MIGHT

00:45:05.636 --> 00:45:07.004
WANT TO MAKE TO THE PROGRAM.

00:45:07.071 --> 00:45:08.672
THAT HOW IS THAT GOING TO AFFECT

00:45:08.739 --> 00:45:13.210
THE THE C. D. C.'S OVERALL

00:45:13.277 --> 00:45:13.844
ADMINISTRATION OF THE PROGRAM.

00:45:13.911 --> 00:45:14.611
SO IN TERMS OF THE

00:45:14.678 --> 00:45:15.646
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE MADE AND

00:45:15.712 --> 00:45:16.647
THAT SORT OF THE FIRST AND MOST

00:45:16.713 --> 00:45:18.382
OBVIOUS ONE IS REQUIRE BETTER

00:45:18.449 --> 00:45:20.651
DATA COLLECTION -- WE ARE ASKED

00:45:20.717 --> 00:45:21.285
TO LOOK AT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF

00:45:21.351 --> 00:45:23.187
THIS PROGRAM THE SHORT ANSWER IS

00:45:23.253 --> 00:45:24.588
WE DON'T REALLY KNOW BECAUSE

00:45:24.655 --> 00:45:26.790
THERE ISN'T DATA TO SHOW THE KEY.

00:45:26.857 --> 00:45:28.625
METRIC OF IS THIS INCREASING

00:45:28.692 --> 00:45:30.160
WALKING OR BIKING THERE IS SOME

00:45:30.227 --> 00:45:32.196
DATA BEING COLLECTED THE QUALITY

00:45:32.262 --> 00:45:33.530
OF THE DATA FOR A VARIETY OF

00:45:33.597 --> 00:45:35.365
REASONS WE THOUGHT WAS SO POOR

00:45:35.432 --> 00:45:36.900
THAT IT REALLY WASN'T USABLE IN

00:45:36.967 --> 00:45:37.835
SOME CASES IT GAVE

00:45:37.901 --> 00:45:39.103
COUNTERINTUITIVE RESULTS AND IT

00:45:39.169 --> 00:45:40.337
JUST DIDN'T REALLY MAKE SENSE

00:45:40.404 --> 00:45:40.771
AND SO WE REALLY.

00:45:40.838 --> 00:45:41.905
THOUGHT THAT WAS.

00:45:41.972 --> 00:45:43.207
THE QUALITY OF THE DATA I'M

00:45:43.273 --> 00:45:45.008
CALTRANS NOTED IN AND ONE OF

00:45:45.075 --> 00:45:46.510
THEIR UPDATE REPORTS SIMILAR

00:45:46.577 --> 00:45:47.845
CONCERNS ABOUT THE QUALITY OF

00:45:47.911 --> 00:45:48.912
THE DATA.

00:45:48.979 --> 00:45:50.314
SO THAT WOULD BE THE FIRST

00:45:50.380 --> 00:45:51.782
RECOMMENDATION IS JUST YOU KNOW

00:45:51.849 --> 00:45:52.883
INSURE THAT THE PROGRAM IS

00:45:52.950 --> 00:45:55.419
COLLECTING GOOD DATA SO YOU CAN

00:45:55.486 --> 00:45:56.987
EVALUATE THE OUTCOMES.

00:45:57.054 --> 00:45:59.323
I'M A COLLECTING IN A ROBUST

00:45:59.389 --> 00:46:01.024
DATA ON PEDESTRIAN AND

00:46:01.091 --> 00:46:02.960
BICYCLISTS COUNTS.

00:46:03.026 --> 00:46:04.595
CAN BE EXPENSIVE AND IF YOU'RE

00:46:04.661 --> 00:46:05.195
TALKING ABOUT A REALLY SMALL

00:46:05.262 --> 00:46:07.264
PROJECT IT MIGHT NOT MAKE SENSE

00:46:07.331 --> 00:46:08.799
IN ALL OF THOSE CASES AND SO

00:46:08.866 --> 00:46:09.933
YOU'RE GONNA WANT TO THINK ABOUT

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:10.734
WHAT PROJECTS.

00:46:10.801 --> 00:46:12.369
DOES THAT MAKE THE MOST SENSE TO

00:46:12.436 --> 00:46:14.705
COLLECT THIS DATA ON AND HAVE.

00:46:14.771 --> 00:46:16.073
A MEANINGFUL BICYCLE AND

00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:18.041
PEDESTRIAN COUNTS AND WHICH

00:46:18.108 --> 00:46:20.377
PROJECTS DO YOU JUST YOU KNOW

00:46:20.444 --> 00:46:21.211
SAY.

00:46:21.278 --> 00:46:22.880
WERE FIXING THE SMALL AREA OF

00:46:22.946 --> 00:46:24.114
SIDEWALK AND THAT'S A GOOD THING

00:46:24.181 --> 00:46:26.817
TO DO BUT MAYBE IT'S NOT WORTH

00:46:26.884 --> 00:46:27.451
GOING THROUGH THE WHOLE PROCESS

00:46:27.518 --> 00:46:29.753
OF AS I'M DOING THESE YOU KNOW

00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:34.258
MORE AND MORE LENGTHY AND COUNTS.

00:46:34.324 --> 00:46:35.125
SO IT THE SECOND RECOMMENDATION

00:46:35.192 --> 00:46:37.394
THAT WE HAVE IS REALLY TO JUST

00:46:37.461 --> 00:46:38.962
CONSIDER WHAT IS THE ROLE OF THE

00:46:39.029 --> 00:46:39.930
STATEWIDE COMPONENT OF THE

00:46:39.997 --> 00:46:41.698
PROGRAM SO IN THE ACTIVE

00:46:41.765 --> 00:46:43.133
TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM WAS.

00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:45.702
CREATED AGAIN THAT THE IDEA WAS

00:46:45.769 --> 00:46:47.771
TO GIVE THE STATE'S SAM ROLE IN

00:46:47.838 --> 00:46:49.239
SETTING PRIORITIES.

00:46:49.306 --> 00:46:51.708
I'M AND BRING GREATER FOCUS TO

00:46:51.775 --> 00:46:53.210
THE PROGRAM AND SO.

00:46:53.277 --> 00:46:54.178
WHEN WE LOOK AT THE STATE RIGHT

00:46:54.244 --> 00:46:55.579
COMPONENT OF THE PROGRAM AND

00:46:55.646 --> 00:46:57.414
COMPARE IT TO THE REGIONAL

00:46:57.481 --> 00:46:59.716
COMPONENTS THE MPO -- AND THE

00:46:59.783 --> 00:47:01.118
SMALL URBAN AND RURAL WE'RE

00:47:01.185 --> 00:47:02.186
FINDING THE SAME TYPES OF

00:47:02.252 --> 00:47:03.754
PROJECTS ACROSS ALL THREE OF

00:47:03.820 --> 00:47:04.888
THESE COMPONENTS.

00:47:04.955 --> 00:47:06.623
AND SO IT REALLY SEEMS THAT EACH

00:47:06.690 --> 00:47:07.791
OF THE DIFFERENT COMPONENTS ARE

00:47:07.858 --> 00:47:10.194
ESSENTIALLY TRYING TO MEET THE

00:47:10.260 --> 00:47:11.628
SAME GOALS.

00:47:11.695 --> 00:47:13.830
I'M AND WE'RE NOT SEEING A REAL

00:47:13.897 --> 00:47:15.666
SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN TERMS

00:47:15.732 --> 00:47:18.068
OF WHY THE STATE AS HAVING A

00:47:18.135 --> 00:47:19.870
ROLE IN SELECTING CERTAIN

00:47:19.937 --> 00:47:22.472
PROJECTS WHEN WE OVER ALL SEEM

00:47:22.539 --> 00:47:23.607
TO BE FINDING THE SAME TYPES OF

00:47:23.674 --> 00:47:25.209
PROJECTS THAT WOULD BE FUNDED IF.

00:47:25.275 --> 00:47:27.110
WE WERE ALLOWING -- REGIONS TO

00:47:27.177 --> 00:47:28.111
JUST CHOOSE THE PROJECTS

00:47:28.178 --> 00:47:29.346
THEMSELVES.

00:47:29.413 --> 00:47:30.814
AND SO YOU MAY WANT TO CONSIDER

00:47:30.881 --> 00:47:31.748
YOU KNOW THEY'RE THERE CAN

00:47:31.815 --> 00:47:33.050
DEFINITELY BE BENEFITS OF HAVING

00:47:33.116 --> 00:47:34.918
A STATEWIDE ROLE AND STATE

00:47:34.985 --> 00:47:36.019
PRODUCT SELECTION AND

00:47:36.086 --> 00:47:37.354
PRIORITIZATION.

00:47:37.421 --> 00:47:38.922
THERE CAN BE THESE LARGER

00:47:38.989 --> 00:47:40.490
TRANSFORMATIVE PROJECTS THAT WE

00:47:40.557 --> 00:47:42.059
TALKED ABOUT THAT.

00:47:42.125 --> 00:47:43.360
AND YOU KNOW ARE REALLY GOING TO

00:47:43.427 --> 00:47:44.394
BE THE THINGS THAT ARE GOING TO

00:47:44.461 --> 00:47:47.297
LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT MODE SHIFT.

00:47:47.364 --> 00:47:48.832
AND BUT I SPANIEL SMALL

00:47:48.899 --> 00:47:50.601
COMMUNITY IT MIGHT NOT BE ABLE

00:47:50.667 --> 00:47:52.569
TO AFFORD THAT PROJECT ON THEIR

00:47:52.636 --> 00:47:55.172
OWN AND SO HAVING A YOU KNOW A

00:47:55.239 --> 00:47:56.607
POT OF FUNDING THROUGH THE STATE

00:47:56.673 --> 00:47:58.508
RIGHT COMPONENT. TO REALLY PUT

00:47:58.575 --> 00:48:00.744
PUT A LOT MORE MONEY THAN ANYONE

00:48:00.811 --> 00:48:03.213
CITY OR JURISDICTION COULD MAYBE

00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:04.648
PUT INTO A PROJECT COULD BE A

00:48:04.715 --> 00:48:06.250
REAL BENEFIT AND THAT WAY TO

00:48:06.316 --> 00:48:07.484
MAKE A LOT OF SENSE IN TERMS OF

00:48:07.551 --> 00:48:08.719
ALL WHY IS THE STATE INVOLVED IN

00:48:08.785 --> 00:48:09.653
ADMINISTERING THIS PROGRAM

00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:10.954
BECAUSE WE'RE DOING THINGS.

00:48:11.021 --> 00:48:12.356
THAT THE CITIES AND COUNTIES

00:48:12.422 --> 00:48:15.092
WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO DO OTHERWISE --

00:48:15.158 --> 00:48:16.393
AND SO THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS

00:48:16.460 --> 00:48:17.160
TO CONSIDER YOUCOULD HAVE A

00:48:17.227 --> 00:48:18.295
DIFFERENT ROLE FOR THE STATE

00:48:18.362 --> 00:48:19.529
RIGHT COMPONENT OF THE PROGRAM

00:48:19.596 --> 00:48:20.998
BUT WHEN WE LOOKED AT IT GIVEN

00:48:21.064 --> 00:48:22.499
THE RATIONALE ON THE REASONS WHY

00:48:22.566 --> 00:48:23.900
THE PROGRAM WAS CREATED.

00:48:23.967 --> 00:48:25.335
FOCUSING THAT PIECE ON THESE

00:48:25.402 --> 00:48:26.870
LARGER MORE TRANSFORMATIVE

00:48:26.937 --> 00:48:33.243
PROJECTS SEEM TO MAKE A LOT MORE

00:48:33.310 --> 00:48:34.678
SENSE TO US.

00:48:34.745 --> 00:48:35.412
SO THEN IF IF YOU'RE THINKING

00:48:35.479 --> 00:48:36.179
ABOUT POSSIBLY CHANGING WHAT

00:48:36.246 --> 00:48:37.214
THAT FOCUS OF THE STATEWIDE

00:48:37.281 --> 00:48:37.814
COMPONENT OF THE PROGRAM GOES

00:48:37.881 --> 00:48:38.615
TILL.

00:48:38.682 --> 00:48:40.450
THEN IT ALSO YOU'RE GONNA WANT

00:48:40.517 --> 00:48:41.885
TO THINK ABOUT HOW HOW ARE YOU

00:48:41.952 --> 00:48:44.021
CHANGING POTENTIALLY THE

00:48:44.087 --> 00:48:44.588
REGIONAL COMPONENTS OF THE

00:48:44.655 --> 00:48:46.523
PROGRAM -- IF THE STATE'S

00:48:46.590 --> 00:48:47.491
FOCUSING ON THESE LARGER

00:48:47.557 --> 00:48:48.925
PROJECTS SHOULD THE REGION'S

00:48:48.992 --> 00:48:51.328
HAVE MORE FLEXIBILITY TO FOCUS

00:48:51.395 --> 00:48:53.163
ON EITHER SMALLER PROJECTS OR

00:48:53.230 --> 00:48:54.865
JUST OTHER PROJECTS THAT FROM

00:48:54.931 --> 00:48:56.767
THEIR REGIONAL PERSPECTIVE ARE

00:48:56.833 --> 00:48:58.368
THE HIGHEST PRIORITY PROJECTS.

00:48:58.435 --> 00:48:59.202
AND SO THAT'S THE LAST

00:48:59.269 --> 00:49:00.337
RECOMMENDATION IS THAT WE JUST

00:49:00.404 --> 00:49:01.438
THINK YOU SHOULD CONSIDER GIVING

00:49:01.505 --> 00:49:03.073
MORE FLEXIBILITY TO THE M. P.

00:49:03.140 --> 00:49:03.907
O.'S.

00:49:03.974 --> 00:49:05.509
ON AS YOU THINK ABOUT MAKING

00:49:05.575 --> 00:49:07.110
THESE POTENTIALLY STRUCTURAL

00:49:07.177 --> 00:49:08.779
CHANGES OF HOW THE ACTIVE

00:49:08.845 --> 00:49:10.847
TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM FUNDING

00:49:10.914 --> 00:49:12.049
GOES OUT AND WHAT GOALS TO

00:49:12.115 --> 00:49:13.183
DIFFERENT POTS OF MONEY ARE

00:49:13.250 --> 00:49:14.484
TRYING TO ACHIEVE.

00:49:14.551 --> 00:49:15.786
YOU'RE GONNA NATURALLY WANT TO

00:49:15.852 --> 00:49:17.654
ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES OF

00:49:17.721 --> 00:49:19.556
HOW THE PROGRAM IS ADMINISTERED --

00:49:19.623 --> 00:49:20.090
IF YOU HAVE THE DIFFERENT

00:49:20.157 --> 00:49:21.725
COMPONENTS OF THE PROGRAM TRYING

00:49:21.792 --> 00:49:23.293
TO MEET DIFFERENT GOALS WE'RE

00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:24.461
TRYING TO GIVE MORE FLEXIBILITY

00:49:24.528 --> 00:49:26.296
TO THE MPO THIS PROBABLY DOESN'T

00:49:26.363 --> 00:49:27.464
MAKE SENSE TO HAVE ALL OF THE

00:49:27.531 --> 00:49:29.833
APPLICATIONS FLOWING THROUGH CTC.

00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:31.301
AND HAVING THEM COMPETE FOR A

00:49:31.368 --> 00:49:33.070
PROGRAM THAT REALLY THOSE

00:49:33.136 --> 00:49:34.471
PROJECTS MAYBE OUR TICKET.

00:49:34.538 --> 00:49:35.105
FOR FOR AND SO WE THINK YOU'RE

00:49:35.172 --> 00:49:36.039
GONNA WANT TO THINK ABOUT

00:49:36.106 --> 00:49:37.874
REGARDLESS OF WHAT YOU DO MAYBE

00:49:37.941 --> 00:49:39.509
GIVING SOME MORE FLEXIBILITY TO

00:49:39.576 --> 00:49:41.912
THE PO'S -- THAT COULD BE DONE

00:49:41.978 --> 00:49:43.980
BY AND JUST GIVING THEM MORE

00:49:44.047 --> 00:49:45.649
FLEXIBILITY TO CHOOSE PROJECTS

00:49:45.716 --> 00:49:46.750
AND NOT RESTRICTING THEM TO THE

00:49:46.817 --> 00:49:48.218
LIST OF PROJECTS THAT FIRST

00:49:48.285 --> 00:49:49.920
COMPETE AND DON'T RECEIVE

00:49:49.986 --> 00:49:51.655
FUNDING TO THE STATE PROGRAM.

00:49:51.722 --> 00:49:53.457
I'M OR COULD BE DONE BY A GIVING

00:49:53.523 --> 00:49:54.691
ALMOST MORE OF LIKE A BLOCK

00:49:54.758 --> 00:49:56.460
GRANT TO THE M. PO'S AND LETTING

00:49:56.526 --> 00:49:57.761
THEM JUST CHOOSE THE PROJECTS

00:49:57.828 --> 00:49:59.596
THAT ARE THE HIGHEST PRIORITY

00:49:59.663 --> 00:50:00.464
FOR THE REGION.

00:50:00.530 --> 00:50:01.498
AND THEN PUTTING SOME REPORTING

00:50:01.565 --> 00:50:04.668
REQUIREMENTS -- ON THOSE REGIONS

00:50:04.735 --> 00:50:05.736
TO TO LET THE STATE NOW WHAT WAS

00:50:05.802 --> 00:50:07.404
DONE WITH THE FUNDS AND WHAT THE

00:50:07.471 --> 00:50:09.339
OUTCOMES WERE -- SO THOSE ARE

00:50:09.406 --> 00:50:10.407
THOSE ARE THE RECOMMENDATIONS

00:50:10.474 --> 00:50:11.975
AND A SUMMARY OF A REPORT AND I

00:50:12.042 --> 00:50:15.679
AM HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS

00:50:15.746 --> 00:50:16.747
THAT YOU HAVE.

00:50:16.813 --> 00:50:17.647
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:50:17.714 --> 00:50:18.715
THERE'S NO QUESTIONS RIGHT NOW

00:50:18.782 --> 00:50:20.917
WHEN WE MOVE ON TO THE MR FONG

00:50:20.984 --> 00:50:22.786
SORRY.

00:50:22.853 --> 00:50:25.288
A JUST A CURIOSITY IN TERMS OF

00:50:25.355 --> 00:50:27.657
THE DATA COLLECTION -- HOW IS IT

00:50:27.724 --> 00:50:28.592
DONE NOW?

00:50:28.658 --> 00:50:30.327
HOW IS IT A COLLECTED WHAT

00:50:30.394 --> 00:50:32.295
QUESTIONS THEY ASK I'M JUST?

00:50:32.362 --> 00:50:34.998
SO CURRENTLY AND THAT THERE ARE.

00:50:35.065 --> 00:50:37.134
AT IN SOME CASES THERE'S AND

00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:38.802
PEDESTRIAN BICYCLIST COUNTS

00:50:38.869 --> 00:50:40.237
HAPPENING BEFORE THE PROJECT

00:50:40.303 --> 00:50:41.638
JUST AT SOME POINT BEFORE THE

00:50:41.705 --> 00:50:42.873
PROJECT IS DONE.

00:50:42.939 --> 00:50:44.474
AND THEN WITHIN SIX MONTHS OF

00:50:44.541 --> 00:50:45.675
COMPLETION OF THE PROJECT OF

00:50:45.742 --> 00:50:49.279
THERE IS THAT -- PROJECT

00:50:49.346 --> 00:50:51.314
AND SO -- SOME OF THE ISSUE SOME

00:50:51.381 --> 00:50:52.416
PROJECTS JUST DIDN'T DO THE

00:50:52.482 --> 00:50:53.884
BICYCLE AND PEDESTRIAN COUNT

00:50:53.950 --> 00:50:55.919
MANY OF THEM DEAD THE PROBLEM IS

00:50:55.986 --> 00:50:57.387
THAT AND THERE WAS INCONSISTENT

00:50:57.454 --> 00:50:58.755
METHODOLOGIES.

00:50:58.822 --> 00:51:01.391
SO AND WE WERE GIVEN ONE AND

00:51:01.458 --> 00:51:03.860
SAMPLE PROJECT TO LOOK AT AND IN

00:51:03.927 --> 00:51:06.029
THAT CASE THE BICYCLE AND

00:51:06.096 --> 00:51:07.364
PEDESTRIAN COUNT THAT IT

00:51:07.431 --> 00:51:08.398
HAPPENED.

00:51:08.465 --> 00:51:10.367
BEFORE THE PROJECT AND THIS WAS

00:51:10.434 --> 00:51:12.803
A PROJECT AND TO INCREASE ACTIVE

00:51:12.869 --> 00:51:15.338
TRANSPORTATION AROUND A

00:51:15.405 --> 00:51:16.039
PARTICULAR SCHOOL.

00:51:16.106 --> 00:51:18.508
AND SO THAT PROJECT -- THAT THE

00:51:18.575 --> 00:51:20.710
COUNTS BEFOREHAND DID A SURVEY

00:51:20.777 --> 00:51:22.679
OF THE PARENTS AND IT WAS LIKE

00:51:22.746 --> 00:51:24.414
IT LATE SUMMER SO PROBABLY

00:51:24.481 --> 00:51:26.049
AROUND THE VERY START OF THE

00:51:26.116 --> 00:51:26.850
SCHOOL YEAR.

00:51:26.917 --> 00:51:28.518
AND WHEN THE WEATHER WAS

00:51:28.585 --> 00:51:29.953
PROBABLY GOOD AND THE

00:51:30.020 --> 00:51:31.455
METHODOLOGY WAS TO SURVEY THE

00:51:31.521 --> 00:51:32.856
PARENTS AND SAY HEY WALKIE

00:51:32.923 --> 00:51:34.157
HAVING YOUR KIDS WALK TO SCHOOL

00:51:34.224 --> 00:51:34.958
IS A GREAT THING HOW YOU KNOW

00:51:35.025 --> 00:51:35.725
HOW MANY.

00:51:35.792 --> 00:51:37.661
HOW HOW OFTEN YOUR KIDS WALK IN

00:51:37.727 --> 00:51:39.362
SO THERE CAN BE SOME IMPLICIT

00:51:39.429 --> 00:51:40.764
BIAS THAN IN THE THE THE

00:51:40.831 --> 00:51:42.365
METHODOLOGY USED?

00:51:42.432 --> 00:51:43.667
AS WELL AS THE WEATHER AND THE

00:51:43.733 --> 00:51:45.235
TIMING YOU KNOW THE START OF

00:51:45.302 --> 00:51:46.169
SCHOOL MAYBE MORE KIDS ARE

00:51:46.236 --> 00:51:46.703
WALKING.

00:51:46.770 --> 00:51:48.705
THE FOLLOW UP WITHIN SIX MONTHS

00:51:48.772 --> 00:51:50.674
LATER IN THE MIDDLE OF WINTER --

00:51:50.740 --> 00:51:52.909
WHERE YOU KNOW MAYBE THE WEATHER

00:51:52.976 --> 00:51:54.377
WAS GOOD BUT MAYBE NOT -- IT'S

00:51:54.444 --> 00:51:55.512
REALLY UNCLEAR AND THE

00:51:55.579 --> 00:51:56.847
METHODOLOGY WAS DIFFERENT IN

00:51:56.913 --> 00:51:58.381
THAT CASE THERE WAS --

00:51:58.448 --> 00:51:59.883
STATIONARY CAMERAS THAT WERE IN

00:51:59.950 --> 00:52:01.952
THE AREA AND THOSE WERE USED TO

00:52:02.018 --> 00:52:03.487
DO MANUAL COUNTS OF THE NUMBER

00:52:03.553 --> 00:52:05.622
OF CHILDREN THAT WERE WALKING ON

00:52:05.689 --> 00:52:06.456
THE CAMPUS.

00:52:06.523 --> 00:52:08.692
AND SORT OF AND SURPRISINGLY IT

00:52:08.758 --> 00:52:10.627
SHOWS THAT THE PROJECT RESULTED

00:52:10.694 --> 00:52:12.996
IN LESS AFTER FOR INTERPRETATION

00:52:13.063 --> 00:52:14.197
BUT THOSE RESULTS ARE REALLY

00:52:14.264 --> 00:52:15.832
MEANINGFUL BECAUSE THERE IS SO

00:52:15.899 --> 00:52:17.067
MUCH INCONSISTENCY IN THE

00:52:17.133 --> 00:52:18.735
METHODOLOGY THAT.

00:52:18.802 --> 00:52:19.336
DOESN'T.

00:52:19.402 --> 00:52:20.770
SO THERE SHOULD BE A UNIFORM AT

00:52:20.837 --> 00:52:22.339
THE DOLLAR TREE AND AND

00:52:22.405 --> 00:52:23.707
EVALUATING ALL THESE PROJECTS

00:52:23.773 --> 00:52:25.542
EXACTLY AND ALLOWING ENOUGH TIME

00:52:25.609 --> 00:52:26.376
LIKE RIGHT NOW WITH HAVING THAT

00:52:26.443 --> 00:52:28.845
THE COMPLETION REPORTS DO WITHIN

00:52:28.912 --> 00:52:30.947
SIX MONTHS -- THAT MIGHT NOT BE

00:52:31.014 --> 00:52:32.082
ENOUGH TIME FOR USERS TO

00:52:32.148 --> 00:52:34.150
ACTUALLY MAKE A CHANGE TO DECIDE --

00:52:34.217 --> 00:52:35.585
HE THERE'S THIS REALLY NICE BIKE

00:52:35.652 --> 00:52:37.787
PATH I'M GOING TO USE IT -- AND

00:52:37.854 --> 00:52:39.055
YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO BE

00:52:39.122 --> 00:52:40.657
LOOKING AT MAYBE THE SAME TIME

00:52:40.724 --> 00:52:43.126
OF YEAR -- SINCE YOU KNOW ACTIVE

00:52:43.193 --> 00:52:44.594
TRANSPORTATION IS GONNA BE

00:52:44.661 --> 00:52:46.429
PRETTY SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY

00:52:46.496 --> 00:52:46.763
THE WEATHER.

00:52:46.830 --> 00:52:51.801
THE OTHER BEST PRACTICES THAT

00:52:51.868 --> 00:52:53.670
EXIST.

00:52:53.737 --> 00:52:54.905

TO BEGIN IMPLEMENTING AND

00:53:50.093 --> 00:53:50.560
THEY'RE IN THE PROCESS OF

00:53:50.627 --> 00:53:51.461
IMPLEMENTING.

00:53:51.528 --> 00:53:54.064
UNIFORM COUNTER METHODOLOGY --

00:53:54.130 --> 00:53:54.998
TOOL.

00:53:55.065 --> 00:53:57.467

00:54:06.910 --> 00:54:07.611
DATA.

00:54:07.677 --> 00:54:08.645
BUT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:54:08.712 --> 00:54:09.713
THAT THE DATA COLLECTION

00:54:09.779 --> 00:54:10.847
METHODOLOGIES ACCOUNT FOR

00:54:10.914 --> 00:54:12.382
SEASONAL VARIATIONS AND OTHER

00:54:12.449 --> 00:54:13.583
FACTORS.

00:54:13.650 --> 00:54:16.086
THIS IS A HUGE ISSUE THAT WE WE

00:54:16.152 --> 00:54:17.320
ARE VERY THANKFUL FOR THE LA US

00:54:17.387 --> 00:54:19.522

BEEN ON OUR YOU KNOW VERY

00:54:21.291 --> 00:54:22.559
CONCERNING TO THE COMMISSION

00:54:22.626 --> 00:54:27.464
THAT WE ARE ADDRESSING.

00:54:27.530 --> 00:54:28.632

THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- AND WE

00:54:30.467 --> 00:54:32.936
HAVE A QUESTION FROM.

00:54:33.003 --> 00:54:34.571
MS RIVER SEND THEM AS GARCIA.

00:54:34.638 --> 00:54:37.374
MY QUESTION WAS IF ANY OF THESE

00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:38.642
EIGHTY P. -- PROJECTS TARGET

00:54:38.708 --> 00:54:40.610
AREAS NEAR SCHOOLS I KNOW YOU

00:54:40.677 --> 00:54:42.445
JUST MENTION AN EXAMPLE BUT IS

00:54:42.512 --> 00:54:44.514
THAT SOMETHING THAT WE ENCOURAGE

00:54:44.581 --> 00:54:46.016
OR THE WE TRACK IF.

00:54:46.082 --> 00:54:47.283
IF THESE PROJECTS ARE NEAR

00:54:47.350 --> 00:54:48.551
SCHOOLS.

00:54:48.618 --> 00:54:50.153
I'M YES SO.

00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:52.122
AND AND IN MY BRIEF DESCRIPTION

00:54:52.188 --> 00:54:54.090
OF THE SETTING UP OF THE PROGRAM

00:54:54.157 --> 00:54:55.025
AND IT'S ACTUALLY QUITE

00:54:55.091 --> 00:54:57.394
COMPLICATED SO WHEN THERE WERE

00:54:57.460 --> 00:54:59.529
DIFFERENT AND SMALLER PROGRAMS

00:54:59.596 --> 00:55:00.864
INITIALLY ONE OF THOSE WAS A

00:55:00.930 --> 00:55:02.298
SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOL PROGRAM

00:55:02.365 --> 00:55:03.633
AND SO THAT WAS COMBINED.

00:55:03.700 --> 00:55:04.834
AND THEIR CERTAIN THE MONEY'S

00:55:04.901 --> 00:55:07.637
THERE THAT AND YOU.

00:55:07.704 --> 00:55:09.039
HAVE TO BE USED FOR THAT SO IT'S

00:55:09.105 --> 00:55:10.206
AND THE YOU KNOW THERE'S THERE'S

00:55:10.273 --> 00:55:12.008
FLEXIBILITY AND DISCRETION FOR

00:55:12.075 --> 00:55:13.309
THE COMMISSION TO BE ABLE TO

00:55:13.376 --> 00:55:14.310
PICK THE PROJECTS THAT ARE THE

00:55:14.377 --> 00:55:16.279
HIGHEST PRIORITY BUT WITHIN THAT

00:55:16.346 --> 00:55:17.213
THERE'S ALSO SOME SORT OF

00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:17.681
SMALLER.

00:55:17.747 --> 00:55:18.581
SUB.

00:55:18.648 --> 00:55:20.383
POTS OF MONEY OR SUB PROGRAMS

00:55:20.450 --> 00:55:22.285
AND SO YES THAT IS DEFINITELY A

00:55:22.352 --> 00:55:24.621
FOCUS OF THE PROGRAM IN AND OUT

00:55:24.688 --> 00:55:26.156
OF MISPRINTS AND HAS MORE.

00:55:26.222 --> 00:55:27.490
TO YEAH I WOULD WANT TO ASSURE

00:55:27.557 --> 00:55:28.892
YOU SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOLS IS A

00:55:28.958 --> 00:55:30.960
KEY A HIGH PRIORITY FOR THE

00:55:31.027 --> 00:55:31.761
PROGRAM.

00:55:31.828 --> 00:55:35.598
LAURIE HAS SOME STATISTICAL

00:55:35.665 --> 00:55:36.733
INFORMATION ON THAT.

00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:38.334
YES BECAUSE THE THE INITIAL

00:55:38.401 --> 00:55:39.736
LEGISLATION AND CREATED THE

00:55:39.803 --> 00:55:41.938
PROGRAM IT ACTUALLY MENTIONS

00:55:42.005 --> 00:55:44.507
SPECIFICALLY THAT -- TO

00:55:44.574 --> 00:55:46.309
ENCOURAGE STUDENTS TO WALK AND

00:55:46.376 --> 00:55:48.244
BIKE SO AND OUR EVALUATION

00:55:48.311 --> 00:55:49.779
PROCESS WE ACTUALLY GIVE

00:55:49.846 --> 00:55:51.514
ADDITIONAL POINTS FOR PROJECTS

00:55:51.581 --> 00:55:54.484
THAT BENEFIT STUDENTS.

00:55:54.551 --> 00:55:57.253
AND I WOULD SAY AT LEAST ABOUT

00:55:57.320 --> 00:55:59.956
25% OF OUR PROJECTS AND EVERY

00:56:00.023 --> 00:56:02.425
CYCLE OUR SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOL

00:56:02.492 --> 00:56:07.097
PROJECTS.

00:56:07.163 --> 00:56:08.198
THIS GARCIA.

00:56:08.264 --> 00:56:09.165
YEAH.

00:56:09.232 --> 00:56:11.367
WHAT HAPPENS IF AN ORGANIZATION

00:56:11.434 --> 00:56:13.970
pTHE DATA AND SHARING IT WITH

00:56:14.037 --> 00:56:14.871
EVEN IF IT WAS AND THE BEST

00:56:14.938 --> 00:56:16.439
PRACTICES BUT SOMEONE NOT EVEN

00:56:16.506 --> 00:56:18.208
COLLECTING THE DATA WHAT HAPPENS?

00:56:18.274 --> 00:56:20.643
THEN. TO TO THE ORGANIZATION IS

00:56:20.710 --> 00:56:22.345
THERE ANY SORT OF CONSEQUENCE

00:56:22.412 --> 00:56:23.947
ACCOUNTABILITY.

00:56:24.013 --> 00:56:25.882
I'M I I WILL I WILL LET THAT

00:56:25.949 --> 00:56:27.617
TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION ANSWER

00:56:27.684 --> 00:56:29.052
THAT ONE JUST SINCE THEY'RE MORE

00:56:29.119 --> 00:56:30.720
INVOLVED WITH SETTING WHAT DATE

00:56:30.787 --> 00:56:31.855
IT BUT I THINK.

00:56:31.921 --> 00:56:33.456
PART OF THE ISSUE IS JUST THE

00:56:33.523 --> 00:56:35.125
WAY THAT THAT.

00:56:35.191 --> 00:56:36.860
THAT THEY'RE REQUIRED TO REPORT

00:56:36.926 --> 00:56:38.194
IT WITHIN THE SIX MONTH TIME

00:56:38.261 --> 00:56:40.697
PERIOD REALLY DOESN'T ALLOW FOR

00:56:40.764 --> 00:56:42.332
SOME OF THESE BEST PRACTICES.

00:56:42.398 --> 00:56:43.533
AND SO.

00:56:43.600 --> 00:56:45.001
THERE EAT YOU YOU COULD HAVE A

00:56:45.068 --> 00:56:46.970
PROJECT SPONSOR THAT IS TRYING

00:56:47.036 --> 00:56:48.004
TO DO EVERYTHING RIGHT AND MEET

00:56:48.071 --> 00:56:49.272
ALL THE REQUIREMENTS AND THE

00:56:49.339 --> 00:56:50.974
STILL AND THAT PROVIDING DATA

00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:52.842
THAT'S KINDA USELESS.

00:56:52.909 --> 00:56:54.611
AND LET'S NOT USE I MEAN I GET

00:56:54.677 --> 00:56:56.112
THE USELESS DATA PURPOSE SO THEY

00:56:56.179 --> 00:56:57.814
TRY TO I'M NOT TRYING TO TING ON

00:56:57.881 --> 00:56:58.915
THAT BUT THEN YOU HAVE FOLKS

00:56:58.982 --> 00:57:00.517
THAT DIDN'T PROVIDE ANY DATA I'M

00:57:00.583 --> 00:57:01.618
ASKING ABOUT THOSE PEOPLE THAT

00:57:01.684 --> 00:57:02.986
HE DIDN'T EVEN TRY.

00:57:03.052 --> 00:57:05.054
SURE YEAH SO A IT SOMEWHERE IT

00:57:05.121 --> 00:57:06.089
DIFFICULT ONCE YOU'VE ALREADY

00:57:06.156 --> 00:57:07.624
FUNDED THE PROJECT BUT I WILL

00:57:07.690 --> 00:57:09.125
LET AND THE TRANSPORTATION

00:57:09.192 --> 00:57:13.696
COMMISSION SPEAK TO THE SPECIFIC

00:57:13.763 --> 00:57:14.330
REQUIREMENTS AND CONSEQUENCES ON

00:57:14.397 --> 00:57:16.466
THAT.

00:57:16.533 --> 00:57:18.034
AS OF JUNE YEAH I'VE I WAS JUST

00:57:18.101 --> 00:57:19.202
GONNA SAY THAT -- THERE IS NOT A

00:57:19.269 --> 00:57:20.703
STANDARDIZED WAY TO COLLECT DATA

00:57:20.770 --> 00:57:22.906
ANYWHERE SO TO A CERTAIN EXTENT

00:57:22.972 --> 00:57:24.240
THAT CALIFORNIA'S ACTIVE

00:57:24.307 --> 00:57:26.910
TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM IS STATE

00:57:26.976 --> 00:57:28.244
OF THE ART IS NOT ANOTHER.

00:57:28.311 --> 00:57:29.779
PROGRAM.

00:57:29.846 --> 00:57:31.447
LIKE THIS IN THE COUNTRY SO.

00:57:31.514 --> 00:57:33.249
THERE ARE NOT STANDARDIZED WAYS

00:57:33.316 --> 00:57:34.717
TO COLLECT DATA SO AND SUSAN HAD

00:57:34.784 --> 00:57:36.219
MENTIONED WE ARE WORKING THROUGH

00:57:36.286 --> 00:57:38.388
THE H. D. ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION

00:57:38.454 --> 00:57:39.823
RESOURCE CENTER.

00:57:39.889 --> 00:57:41.324
AND OUR TECHNICAL ADVISORY

00:57:41.391 --> 00:57:43.159
COMMITTEE TO COME UP WITH THE

00:57:43.226 --> 00:57:44.594
STANDARDIZED WAYS.

00:57:44.661 --> 00:57:48.097
AND SO.

00:57:48.164 --> 00:57:49.165
IT ANOTHER ISSUE WITH THE DATA

00:57:49.232 --> 00:57:50.800
IS SOME OF THESE FACILITIES ARE

00:57:50.867 --> 00:57:52.268
BRAND NEW FACILITIES SO THEY'RE

00:57:52.335 --> 00:57:53.870
NOT THERE YET SO THERE'S NO WAY

00:57:53.937 --> 00:57:55.638
TO COLLECT DATA ON SOMETHING

00:57:55.705 --> 00:57:57.841
THAT IS HASN'T BEEN BUILT YET.

00:57:57.907 --> 00:57:59.375
SO THE WAY THAT THE APPLICANT

00:57:59.442 --> 00:58:02.612
HAS TO TRY TO COME UP WITH DATA

00:58:02.679 --> 00:58:05.114
IS FIND A MAYBE LIKE A PARALLEL

00:58:05.181 --> 00:58:09.619
ROUTE THAT THEY CAN USE AS AS A

00:58:09.686 --> 00:58:13.323
PROXY FOR WHAT THE WHAT THE

00:58:13.389 --> 00:58:15.625
FACILITY WILL WILL DO AFTER IT'S

00:58:15.692 --> 00:58:16.559
BUILT.

00:58:16.626 --> 00:58:18.761
SO I WOULD SAY AT THIS POINT

00:58:18.828 --> 00:58:21.531
THERE ARE NO CONSEQUENCES.

00:58:21.598 --> 00:58:23.867
FOR A APPLICANT THAT DOES NOT

00:58:23.933 --> 00:58:27.136
PROVIDE DATA BUT WE WE WILL WE

00:58:27.203 --> 00:58:29.205
HAVE A REPORTING PROCESS AND

00:58:29.272 --> 00:58:30.440
WE'RE WORKING ON GETTING.

00:58:30.506 --> 00:58:32.041
ALL OF THE REPORTS IN ON TIME

00:58:32.108 --> 00:58:33.509
AND ACCURATE.

00:58:33.576 --> 00:58:34.777
AND IF I COULD FOLLOW UP

00:58:34.844 --> 00:58:36.479
ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND THE

00:58:36.546 --> 00:58:37.647
COMMISSION HAS STRONG

00:58:37.714 --> 00:58:39.249
ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY

00:58:39.315 --> 00:58:40.984
GUIDELINES IN PLACE.

00:58:41.050 --> 00:58:42.785
WITHIN THIS PROGRAM AND JUST AS

00:58:42.852 --> 00:58:44.020
AN OVERALL ACCOUNTABILITY

00:58:44.087 --> 00:58:45.088
GUIDELINES THE COMMISSION HAS

00:58:45.154 --> 00:58:46.389
ADOPTED.

00:58:46.456 --> 00:58:48.524
IT CALLS FOR AUDITS OF THESE

00:58:48.591 --> 00:58:50.627
AGENCIES IT CALLS FOR A REGULAR

00:58:50.693 --> 00:58:52.528
REPORTING AND WHEN THE REGULAR

00:58:52.595 --> 00:58:54.330
REPORTING IS NOT OCCURRING WE

00:58:54.397 --> 00:58:57.433
FOLLOW UP ON THAT -- WHERE THERE

00:58:57.500 --> 00:58:59.936
IS NON COMPLIANCE?

00:59:00.003 --> 00:59:01.771
OVERALL WITH THE EXPENDITURES OF

00:59:01.838 --> 00:59:03.506
THESE FUNDS YES A EIGHT

00:59:03.573 --> 00:59:06.142
ORGANIZATION RECEIVES THE FUNDS.

00:59:06.209 --> 00:59:09.512
AND DOES NOT -- COMPLY YOU KNOW

00:59:09.579 --> 00:59:10.813

00:59:10.880 --> 00:59:12.348
OF THE PROJECT BILL TO DIFFERENT

00:59:12.415 --> 00:59:13.950
PROJECT YOU KNOW THERE'S IF

THERE'S A REPAYMENT MECHANISM IN

00:59:15.652 --> 00:59:17.020
PLACE IN THE STATE TO REAP

00:59:17.086 --> 00:59:18.588
RETURN THOSE FUNDS.

00:59:18.655 --> 00:59:20.056
IN THE CASE OF THE PERFORMANCE

00:59:20.123 --> 00:59:22.158
BENEFITS BECAUSE THIS IS A NEW

00:59:22.225 --> 00:59:23.459
PROGRAM.

00:59:23.526 --> 00:59:25.495
WE NEED TO WORK WITH ALL OF OUR

STAKEHOLDERS THROUGHOUT THE

00:59:26.129 --> 00:59:29.532
STATE TO MAKE SURE THAT -- WE

00:59:29.599 --> 00:59:30.867

TIMELINESS OF REPORTING.

00:59:44.147 --> 00:59:46.249
IS AN ISSUE AND WE EXPECT OUR

00:59:46.316 --> 00:59:48.484

ONE OF THESE PROJECTS THAT THIS.

01:00:06.636 --> 01:00:08.304
GOT IMPLEMENTED IN THE CITY I

01:00:08.371 --> 01:00:12.508
LIVE IN -- AND THE RESULT OF IT

01:00:12.575 --> 01:00:14.010
HAS BEEN TROUBLING TO SCENE BUT

01:00:14.077 --> 01:00:15.712
THEY DID IT'S UNDER THIS YEAR'S

01:00:15.778 --> 01:00:17.647
CORRIDOR AND WE DO HAVE SCHOOLS

01:00:17.714 --> 01:00:19.749
THERE -- BOTH ELEMENTARY MIDDLE

01:00:19.816 --> 01:00:20.783
SCHOOLS ON THAT THIS YEAR'S

THE SPEED LIMIT TO FORTY MILES

01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:25.188
PER HOUR ON THAT FOR THEIR

01:00:25.254 --> 01:00:26.289
CONSTRUCTS ARE MOVING THROUGH

01:00:26.356 --> 01:00:27.357
THEIR BRAVERY.

01:00:27.423 --> 01:00:28.992
AND SO THEY PUT UP A COUPLE OF

01:00:29.058 --> 01:00:30.393
SIGNS TELLING US TO SHARE THE

01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:31.894
ROAD WITH THE CYCLIST.

01:00:31.961 --> 01:00:34.464

01:00:34.530 --> 01:00:35.798
BICYCLE LIKE THIS IS NOW SHERRY

01:00:35.865 --> 01:00:38.034
LANE BUT THERE'S NOTHING ELSE

01:00:38.101 --> 01:00:39.602
THAT WAS ADDED ON TO THE PROJECT.

01:00:39.669 --> 01:00:41.471
THERE'S NO THERE'S NO DIVISION

01:00:41.537 --> 01:00:42.405

01:21:12.367 --> 01:21:13.535

01:21:13.602 --> 01:21:15.270
SEE IT AS A MODEL PROGRAM IN

ARE AS DEBT SERVICE -- FOR

01:30:16.310 --> 01:30:17.578

01:30:17.645 --> 01:30:18.379
AMOUNT THEY WERE COLLECTING

01:30:18.446 --> 01:30:19.580
ANNUALLY WAIT FEES THE

01:30:19.647 --> 01:30:20.882
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE TWO

01:30:20.948 --> 01:30:22.583
AMOUNTS WILL REMAIN IN THE WHO

01:30:22.650 --> 01:30:23.951

01:30:29.957 --> 01:30:31.726
SO THE RIGHT NOW THE THERE THERE

01:30:31.793 --> 01:30:33.494
IS A ALL OF THE WEIGHT FEES HAVE

01:30:33.561 --> 01:30:34.662

THERE IS WAIT FEES.

01:30:37.331 --> 01:30:38.599
BUT EVENTUALLY AS AS WE PAY OFF

01:30:40.735 --> 01:30:41.636
SOMEWHERE IN THERE AND IN THE

01:30:41.702 --> 01:30:46.607
VICINITY OF TWENTY THIRTY SIX

01:30:46.674 --> 01:30:47.175
TWENTY THIRTY SEVEN THAT THE

01:30:47.241 --> 01:30:48.309
TOTAL THAT SERVICE WILL BE LESS

01:30:48.376 --> 01:30:49.277
THAN THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF WEIGHT

01:30:49.343 --> 01:30:50.044
FEES WE'VE COME TO COLLECT AND

01:30:50.111 --> 01:30:51.746
AT THAT POINT.

01:30:51.813 --> 01:30:52.346
THOSE WAIT FEES WILL THEN SEE

01:30:52.413 --> 01:30:55.116

THE WEEK FEEL LOANS THAT ARE IN

01:31:08.863 --> 01:31:10.965
AS PART OF THIS ITEM -- COMES

01:31:11.032 --> 01:31:13.868
FROM WE WHEN THE STATE WAS IN

01:31:13.935 --> 01:31:15.469
THE FISCAL CRISIS AND NEEDING

01:31:15.536 --> 01:31:17.038
GENERAL FUND BUDGET SOLUTIONS

01:31:17.104 --> 01:31:18.773
THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF THE WEIGHT

01:31:18.840 --> 01:31:20.608
FEES THAT ONE BILLION ASH COMING

01:31:20.675 --> 01:31:22.944
IN EACH YEAR WAS USED TO HELP

01:31:23.010 --> 01:31:24.245
THE GENERAL FUND.

01:31:24.312 --> 01:31:25.947
AND IT WAS DONE SO BY PRIMARILY

01:31:26.013 --> 01:31:27.215
PAYING THAT THAT SERVICE ON

01:31:27.281 --> 01:31:28.850
TRANSPORTATION MONTHS BUT AT THE

01:31:28.916 --> 01:31:30.718
TIME IT WAS STARTED.

01:31:30.785 --> 01:31:32.753
THE THE DEBT SERVICE I'M PRAYING

01:31:32.820 --> 01:31:34.789
PRIMARILY ON I PROPOSITION ONE

01:31:34.856 --> 01:31:36.090
BEAT WITH THE LAST THAN THE

01:31:36.157 --> 01:31:36.724
TOTAL AMOUNT OF WEIGHT FEES AND

01:31:36.791 --> 01:31:39.493
SO THE BALANCE IN ORDER TO FULLY

01:31:39.560 --> 01:31:40.728
BENEFIT FROM THE WEIGHT FEES WAS

01:31:40.795 --> 01:31:42.463
LOAN TO THE GENERAL FUND.

01:31:42.530 --> 01:31:44.165
SO THOSE ARE THE LOAN SO AND

01:31:44.232 --> 01:31:44.732
THEN.

01:31:44.799 --> 01:31:46.968
AS THE AMOUNT OF DEBT SERVICE

01:31:47.034 --> 01:31:49.670
NOW HAS GROWN AND EXCEEDS THE

01:31:49.737 --> 01:31:50.838
TOTAL AMOUNT OF THE WEEK FEES

01:31:50.905 --> 01:31:53.374
THOSE LOANS ARE REPAID TO

01:31:53.441 --> 01:31:55.276
TRANSPORTATION TO PAY OFF THE

01:31:55.343 --> 01:31:56.143
DEBT SERVICE AMOUNTS THAT ARE

01:31:56.210 --> 01:31:56.844
HIGHER.

01:31:56.911 --> 01:31:58.379
SO THAT BONDS ARE STILL BEING

01:31:58.446 --> 01:32:00.848
REPAID ACCORDING TO THE SAME

01:32:00.915 --> 01:32:02.383
FEEL LIKE THERE'S PLANNED THERE

01:32:02.450 --> 01:32:09.123
SHOULD BE A FLOW CHART HERE.

01:32:09.190 --> 01:32:10.725
SO SELFISH.

01:32:10.791 --> 01:32:11.525
SO WALK ME THROUGH THIS ONE MORE

01:32:11.592 --> 01:32:12.460
TIME SO THERE WAS SO IF YOU HAD

01:32:12.526 --> 01:32:13.628
SAY A BILLION DOLLARS IN A WEEK

01:32:13.694 --> 01:32:14.795
FEES COMING IN IN YEAR ONE AND

01:32:14.862 --> 01:32:15.730
THAT THAT SERVICE THAT NEEDED TO

01:32:15.796 --> 01:32:17.098
BE PAID IN THAT YOU'RE IN

01:32:17.164 --> 01:32:19.433
TRANSPORTATION BONDS WAS. SIX

01:32:19.500 --> 01:32:21.002
HUNDRED MILLION THE FOUR HUNDRED

01:32:21.068 --> 01:32:23.237
MILLION DIFFERENCE WAS A LOAN TO

01:32:23.304 --> 01:32:25.273
THE GENERAL FUND AND NOT HAPPEN

01:32:25.339 --> 01:32:26.674
FOR SEVERAL YEARS AS THE TOTAL

01:32:26.741 --> 01:32:28.609
DEBT SERVICE ON TRANSPORTATION

01:32:28.676 --> 01:32:30.311
BONDS WITH INCREASING A LOT OF

01:32:30.378 --> 01:32:31.379
THE STATE SERVICES COMING FROM

01:32:31.445 --> 01:32:32.647
THE TWO THOUSAND SIX PROP WHEN

01:32:32.713 --> 01:32:34.782
BE BOND AND SO IT'S STILL.

01:32:34.849 --> 01:32:35.283
INCREASING.

01:32:35.349 --> 01:32:37.351
SO EACH YEAR THAT DIFFERENCE

01:32:37.418 --> 01:32:38.419
WOULD HAVE BEEN ALONE TO THE

01:32:38.486 --> 01:32:39.921
GENERAL FUND NOW THAT DEBT

01:32:39.987 --> 01:32:41.422
SERVICE COSTS ARE MUCH HIGHER

01:32:41.489 --> 01:32:42.723
THAN THE WEIGHT FEES.

01:32:42.790 --> 01:32:44.325
AND SO THOSE FUNDS THAT WERE

01:32:44.392 --> 01:32:45.927
LOAN TO THE GENERAL FUND COME

01:32:45.993 --> 01:32:47.194
BACK TO THE TRANSPORTATION DEBT

01:32:47.261 --> 01:32:49.263
SERVICE ACCOUNT TO PAY FOR THOSE

01:32:49.330 --> 01:32:51.032
HIGHER DEBT SERVICE COSTS.

01:32:51.098 --> 01:32:52.633
SO THE LOAN WAS NOT AT SERVICE

01:32:52.700 --> 01:32:53.701
HIGHER.

01:32:53.768 --> 01:32:55.169
IT GROWS OVER TIME AS THE BONDS

01:32:55.236 --> 01:32:57.505
ARE SOLD SO -- PROPOSITION ONE

01:32:57.571 --> 01:32:59.106
BE WAS A ROUGHLY TWENTY BILLION

01:32:59.173 --> 01:33:01.342
DOLLAR BOND AND SO THE STATE

01:33:01.409 --> 01:33:03.044
STARTED SELLING THOSE BONDS AND

01:33:03.110 --> 01:33:04.779
PROBABLY ABOUT.

01:33:04.845 --> 01:33:05.413
TWO THOUSAND SEVEN BUT STILL YOU

01:33:05.479 --> 01:33:06.647
KNOW DON'T SELL THEM ALL AT ONCE

01:33:06.714 --> 01:33:07.448
SOME OF THEM OVER YEARS AS

01:33:07.515 --> 01:33:09.583
PROJECTS ARE ARE COMING ON LINE.

01:33:09.650 --> 01:33:10.885
AND SO THOSE COSTS WOULD GROW

01:33:10.952 --> 01:33:12.486
OVER TIME UNTIL THEY REACH THEIR

01:33:12.553 --> 01:33:13.821
PEAK AND THEN EVENTUALLY TRAIL

01:33:13.888 --> 01:33:15.556
OFF SO THEY STARTED WHEN THE

01:33:15.623 --> 01:33:18.192
BOND COSTS ARE STILL RISING --

01:33:18.259 --> 01:33:18.793
AND THAT'S WHERE THAT LITTLE

01:33:18.859 --> 01:33:21.329
LOAN PEACE COMES FROM AND SO THE

01:33:21.395 --> 01:33:21.963
PIECE.

01:33:22.029 --> 01:33:23.764
ON YOUR AGENDA TODAY THE EIGHT

01:33:23.831 --> 01:33:24.532

01:33:24.598 --> 01:33:26.600
MILLION IT'S JUST THAT THE

01:33:26.667 --> 01:33:27.601
REMAINING AMOUNT THAT HAVE BEEN

01:33:27.668 --> 01:33:28.903

WE'LL GO BACK TO THE

TRANSPORTATION THAT SERVICE FINE.

01:33:31.472 --> 01:33:33.174
AND WILL BE AVAILABLE THIS YEAR

01:33:33.240 --> 01:33:35.242
NEXT YEAR THE FUTURE YEARS TO

PAY OFF THOSE INCREASED DEBT

01:33:39.180 --> 01:33:39.914
SERVICE COSTS.

01:33:39.981 --> 01:33:42.249
SO WE'RE SO WE'RE PAYING OFF.

01:33:42.316 --> 01:33:43.217

PERIOD OF TIME I'M JUST TRYING

01:48:46.620 --> 01:48:48.555
TO GET A AN IDEA WHETHER.

01:48:48.622 --> 01:48:50.457
SINCE I'VE BEEN AT FINANCE

WHEN IT'S GOTTEN AS LOW AS A

01:49:01.935 --> 01:49:02.435
HUNDRED MILLION?

01:49:02.502 --> 01:49:03.203
BELOW THAT WE WOULD FOR NOT TO

01:49:03.270 --> 01:49:06.539
GO AGAIN FOR CASH REASONS -- I

01:49:06.606 --> 01:49:08.642
KNOW THE GENOCIDE IDEALLY WE SET

01:49:08.708 --> 01:49:09.409
HUNDRED IDEALLY WE DON'T WANNA

01:49:09.476 --> 01:49:10.644
GO BELOW THAT FOR CASH REASONS

01:49:10.710 --> 01:49:12.078
BUT OF OF MORE PRUDENT RESERVE

01:49:12.145 --> 01:49:14.080
WOULD BE ON THE TWO HUNDRED

01:49:14.147 --> 01:49:16.149
MILLION DOLLAR -- TWO HUNDRED TO

01:49:16.216 --> 01:49:16.750
THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR

ETCETERA.

01:49:23.023 --> 01:49:24.724
OKAY SO THAT WOULD BE THE THE

01:49:24.791 --> 01:49:27.260
GOLD TO A YOU THINK WE WANT TO

01:49:27.327 --> 01:49:30.597
ACHIEVE -- AND WHAT WE HAVE

01:49:30.664 --> 01:49:31.998
BEFORE US IS THAT KIND OF

01:49:32.065 --> 01:49:36.069
PATCHWORK OF OF FIXES THAT ARE

01:49:36.136 --> 01:49:38.004
RELATIVELY SHORT TERM IN NATURE

01:49:38.071 --> 01:49:40.573
I THINK THE FOR UP TO FIVE YEARS.

01:49:40.640 --> 01:49:42.342

I'M USUAL.

01:49:51.818 --> 01:49:54.354
INCREASES IN EXPENDITURES AND SO

01:49:54.421 --> 01:49:56.957
YES THIS IS TO BE ABLE TO OFFSET.

01:49:57.023 --> 01:49:57.791
OFFSET THOSE IN THE SHORT TERM

01:49:57.857 --> 01:49:59.292
THAT MAKES SENSE BUT WHAT --

01:49:59.359 --> 01:50:01.394
OTHER THAN A REAL ID BEING

01:50:01.461 --> 01:50:03.163

TO ADDRESS THIS ON A PERMANENT

01:50:12.072 --> 01:50:16.343
PERMANENT OR LONG TERM BASIS.

01:50:16.409 --> 01:50:17.010
WELL AS YOU CAN SEE NOTHING IN A

01:50:17.077 --> 01:50:17.644

THEN WE DO START TO GO BACK UP

01:50:19.412 --> 01:50:21.014

INDEXED FOR INFLATION SO -- THEY

01:50:24.985 --> 01:50:27.554
WOULD.

01:50:27.620 --> 01:50:29.089
WHAT WE GO DOWN BUT THEN WE THAT

01:50:29.155 --> 01:50:29.756
REVENUES KICK UP ENOUGH? TO HELP

01:50:29.823 --> 01:50:31.057
BRING IT BACK UP OBVIOUSLY THIS

01:50:31.124 --> 01:50:32.459
IS A FUND THAT WE ALL MONITOR

01:50:32.525 --> 01:50:33.760
VERY CLOSELY.

01:50:33.827 --> 01:50:34.961
I'M A WE WOULD CONTINUE TO

01:50:35.028 --> 01:50:36.329
MONITOR REVENUES AND

01:50:36.396 --> 01:50:37.564
EXPENDITURES TO SEE IN THE

01:50:37.630 --> 01:50:39.299
FUTURE YOU KNOW.

01:50:39.366 --> 01:50:40.967
THREE FOUR YEARS OUT -- IF

ADDITIONAL ACTIONS ARE NEEDED

01:50:42.402 --> 01:50:42.635
[inaudible]

01:50:42.702 --> 01:50:46.940

THE ADMINISTRATION'S I MEAN

01:50:50.543 --> 01:50:52.712
BASED ON ON WHAT WE HAVE BEST

01:50:52.779 --> 01:50:54.280
ESTIMATES RIGHT NOW WHAT THE

01:50:54.347 --> 01:50:55.882

KEEP THE FUND SOLVENT.

01:50:57.450 --> 01:51:00.787
IT'S BEEN SUGGESTED THE THAT IT

01:51:00.854 --> 01:51:02.589
WOULD BE APPROPRIATE -- BY

01:51:02.655 --> 01:51:05.191

OFFICERS A YEAR UP TO SIX

01:51:26.312 --> 01:51:26.980
HUNDRED WHICH WOULD HAVE

01:51:27.047 --> 01:51:29.015
RESULTED IN A HUNDRED AND TWENTY

01:51:29.082 --> 01:51:32.218
NINE MILLION ONGOING -- WHICH

01:51:32.285 --> 01:51:34.487
ARE GIVEN THE CURRENT.

01:51:34.554 --> 01:51:35.321
EXPENDITURES THE FINE COULD NOT

THE FUTURE.

01:51:53.239 --> 01:51:54.874
WE WOULD HAVE TO BALANCE THE

01:51:54.941 --> 01:51:56.976
EXPENDITURES OUT OF THE NBA

01:51:57.043 --> 01:51:58.511
ALTERNATIVE FUNDS SOURCES

01:51:58.578 --> 01:52:00.847
REVENUE CHANGES IT WOULD BE A

01:52:00.914 --> 01:52:04.717
QUITE A BROAD -- BRIDE DISPLAY

01:52:04.784 --> 01:52:05.752
OF ITEMS THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO

01:52:05.819 --> 01:52:07.854
CONSIDER IN ORDER IF IF WE ARE

01:52:07.921 --> 01:52:10.190

CONSIDERATION OF THAT QUESTION --

01:52:17.831 --> 01:52:19.566
BETWEEN NOW AND THE NEXT TIME

01:52:19.632 --> 01:52:23.203
THAT -- THE COMMITTEE OF

01:52:23.269 --> 01:52:24.571
ADDRESSES THIS ISSUE TO DO ONE

01:52:24.637 --> 01:52:26.039
AT SOMETHING SURE ANTHONY SYMBOL

01:52:26.106 --> 01:52:27.373
FROM THE LESSEE BALANCE OFFICE

01:52:27.440 --> 01:52:29.375
JUST WANNA MAKE A FEW COMMENTS.

01:52:29.442 --> 01:52:31.111
THE FIRST IS IN TERMS OF THAT.

01:52:31.177 --> 01:52:32.045
MAGNITUDE OF THE NEEDFOR

01:52:32.112 --> 01:52:33.813
DIFFERENT ACTIONS TO ADDRESS

01:52:33.880 --> 01:52:35.148
SORT OF THE CONDITION OF NVA

01:52:35.215 --> 01:52:36.416
REALLY STARTS WITH THE LEDGES

01:52:36.483 --> 01:52:38.084
PARTIES FOR EXPENDITURES DO YOU

01:52:38.151 --> 01:52:39.352
PROVIDE THE SAME LEVEL OF

01:52:39.419 --> 01:52:41.521
EXPENDITURE MAYBE AS A GOVERNOR

01:52:41.588 --> 01:52:41.855
YOU MAY WANT.

01:52:41.921 --> 01:52:43.056
TO PROVIDE A HIGHER.

01:52:43.123 --> 01:52:44.357
LEVEL DEPENDING OTHER YOUR OTHER

01:52:44.424 --> 01:52:45.492
PARTIES ARE YOU MAY WANT TO

01:52:45.558 --> 01:52:47.026
PROVIDE A LESS LEVEL LOOK MUCH

01:52:47.093 --> 01:52:47.594
OF THAT.

01:52:47.660 --> 01:52:49.329
COVERS WAS FUNDING INCREASE FROM

01:52:49.395 --> 01:52:50.730
EXPENSES FROM THE NBA DEALS WITH

01:52:50.797 --> 01:52:52.732
SORT OF THE DMV DMV RELATED

01:52:52.799 --> 01:52:54.167
ISSUES REGARDING THE WAIT TIME

01:52:54.234 --> 01:52:55.635
NEVER PLACED REAL ID YOU MAY

01:52:55.702 --> 01:52:56.503
DECIDE YOU DON'T WANT TO FULLY

01:52:56.569 --> 01:52:57.470
FUND THOSE THERE.

01:52:57.537 --> 01:52:58.738
THEN THEN THE ACTIONS NEEDED TO

01:52:58.805 --> 01:53:05.712
KEEP THE FUND SOLVENT ARE ARE

01:53:05.778 --> 01:53:06.779
THE SECOND THING I THOUGHT WAS

01:53:06.846 --> 01:53:07.447
REALLY IN THE CONTEXT OF SORT OF

01:53:07.514 --> 01:53:08.114

01:53:08.181 --> 01:53:08.615
SOME ONGOING CHALLENGES

01:53:08.681 --> 01:53:10.083
PERIODICALLY FOR LAST FOR MANY

01:53:10.150 --> 01:53:10.750
YEARS SO YOU KINDA WANT TO THINK

01:53:10.817 --> 01:53:11.784
SORT OF THE RIGHT OF THE

01:53:11.851 --> 01:53:13.353
GOVERNOR POSES SO THE LONG TERM

01:53:13.419 --> 01:53:14.988
IMPACT OF SOME THESE PROPOSALS.

01:53:15.054 --> 01:53:15.855
THE FIRST ONE I TALK ABOUT IS

01:53:15.922 --> 01:53:17.524

GENERAL FUND.

01:53:20.293 --> 01:53:21.661

01:53:21.728 --> 01:53:22.662
MILLION DOLLARS THAT WE USUALLY

01:53:22.729 --> 01:53:24.564

INITIATIVE AND THAT IS IN. TWO

01:53:27.500 --> 01:53:28.067

FUND AS WE HAVE THIS YEAR AND

01:55:50.877 --> 01:55:52.145
THE DIRECTION THAT THE

ADMINISTRATION RECEIVE FROM THE

01:55:53.246 --> 01:55:55.481

01:55:56.382 --> 01:55:56.816
MILLION.

01:55:56.883 --> 01:55:58.718
AND SO ACTIONS WERE TAKEN I

01:55:58.785 --> 01:55:59.786
WOULD BELIEVE WE WOULD BE IN A

01:55:59.852 --> 01:56:02.488
SIMILAR SITUATION HERE THAT --

01:56:02.555 --> 01:56:03.923
IN IN OUR CURRENT CONDITION WE

01:56:03.990 --> 01:56:05.725
GO TO ONE FIFTY FIVE IF THE

01:56:05.792 --> 01:56:06.559
LEGISLATURE SAYS WE ARE

01:56:06.626 --> 01:56:07.660

01:56:18.838 --> 01:56:21.240
COMFORTABLE LEVEL IS

01:56:21.307 --> 01:56:21.541
[inaudible]

01:56:21.607 --> 01:56:24.143
THIS VOTE.

01:56:24.210 --> 01:56:25.545
I'D JUST A PIGGY BACK ON THAT

01:56:25.611 --> 01:56:27.046
CERTAINLY A I THINK I SHARE THE

01:56:27.113 --> 01:56:28.948
CONCERN OF A MISTER MULLIN

01:56:29.015 --> 01:56:30.383
MISTER BLUE ABOUT TRYING TO BUT

01:56:30.450 --> 01:56:31.751
BEING CONCERNED ABOUT.

01:56:31.818 --> 01:56:32.919
DOING SOME BANDAID SAVINGS NOW

01:56:32.985 --> 01:56:34.587
AND THEN BALLOONING THE COSTS IN

01:56:34.654 --> 01:56:35.521
THE FUTURE.

01:56:35.588 --> 01:56:38.725
ON THE ON THE SPECIFIC -- SHIFT

01:56:38.791 --> 01:56:41.294
AWAY FROM A PAY AS YOU GO TO A

01:56:41.361 --> 01:56:45.465
MORE LEASE BOND -- OPTION WOULD

01:56:45.531 --> 01:56:46.566
THAT WITH THE LA -- AGREE THAT

01:56:46.632 --> 01:56:48.134
THAT CONCERNS REMAINS TO THAT

01:56:48.201 --> 01:56:50.370
WERE INSTEAD OF PAYING AS YOU GO

01:56:50.436 --> 01:56:53.606
THE THE FIXING THINGS THAT IF WE

01:56:53.673 --> 01:56:54.807
GO TO A BOND.

01:56:54.874 --> 01:56:57.710
MECHANISM THAT WE PAY INTEREST

01:56:57.777 --> 01:56:58.811
AND WE BLOOM THE COSTS IN THE

01:56:58.878 --> 01:56:59.345
FUTURE.

01:56:59.412 --> 01:57:01.948
YES BECAUSE I MEAN TRADITIONALLY

01:57:02.014 --> 01:57:03.282
BOTH FOR DMV'S EACH PAY WE FIND

01:57:03.349 --> 01:57:04.884
THE FACILITIES ON A PAY AS YOU

01:57:04.951 --> 01:57:06.953
GO BASIS -- DOING BONTA

01:57:07.019 --> 01:57:07.787
FINANCING ISN'T.

01:57:07.854 --> 01:57:09.155
UNCOMMON IN WHATWE DO A LOT OF

01:57:09.222 --> 01:57:10.790
INFRASTRUCTURE BUILDINGS BUT

01:57:10.857 --> 01:57:11.958
YOU'RE RIGHT IT DOES SORT OF

01:57:12.024 --> 01:57:14.327
PUSH THE PAYMENTS OUT AND DOES

01:57:14.394 --> 01:57:16.062
INCREASE COST ON THOSE INTERESTS

01:57:16.129 --> 01:57:16.729
THE OTHER THING ABOUT OF CITIES

01:57:16.796 --> 01:57:17.764
I KNOW IT IS.

01:57:17.830 --> 01:57:18.965
ROSS OF THE L&lt;c.cyan&gt;G IN PUSHING&lt;/c&gt;

01:57:19.031 --> 01:57:21.234
BACK A LOT OF PROJECTS THAT RIDE

01:57:21.300 --> 01:57:22.101
IN FINDING THAT THE NEW DELAY

01:57:22.168 --> 01:57:23.936
GINGER ADMINISTRATION HAD AGREED

01:57:24.003 --> 01:57:25.605
TO PLAN AND OUR PERSON THOSE

01:57:25.671 --> 01:57:26.906
BACK THOSE ARE ALSO GOING TO BE

01:57:26.973 --> 01:57:28.574
COSTS IN THE OUT YEARS AS WELL.

01:57:28.641 --> 01:57:29.575
SO YOU'RE RIGHT FINANCING ON

01:57:29.642 --> 01:57:32.378
FINANCE BASES DOES INCREASE THE

01:57:32.445 --> 01:57:37.884
INTEREST SAID THEN IT AT THAT

01:57:37.950 --> 01:57:38.651
POINT -- WE RISKING.

01:57:38.718 --> 01:57:39.919
TRYING TO KEEP IT SOLVENT NOW

01:57:39.986 --> 01:57:40.520
AND THEN MAKING IT INSOLVENT

01:57:40.586 --> 01:57:42.155
LATER.

01:57:42.221 --> 01:57:42.989
LOUISE PUSH WHICH IS PUSHING

01:57:43.055 --> 01:57:43.956
THAT WORK WHAT IS PUSHING IT OUT

01:57:44.023 --> 01:57:46.125
RIGHT WITH OUR PROBLEMS ARE

01:57:46.192 --> 01:57:47.860
REALLY FIX THEY WERE JUST.

01:57:47.927 --> 01:57:48.728
WHICH WE WHAT WE'VE SORT OF BEEN

01:57:48.795 --> 01:57:49.996
DOING OVER THE LAST SEVERAL

01:57:50.062 --> 01:57:51.030
YEARS.

01:57:51.097 --> 01:57:53.666
SO ARE THERE BUT THE FROM THE LA

01:57:53.733 --> 01:57:54.233
A PERSPECTIVE THAT ARE THERE

01:57:54.300 --> 01:57:58.504
MORE -- STRUCTURAL CHANGES THAT

01:57:58.571 --> 01:58:00.940
SHOULD BE MADE TO TO TO TO THE

01:58:01.007 --> 01:58:02.108
NBA THAT.

01:58:02.175 --> 01:58:03.109
THAT MAKES IT MORE SOLVENT AND

01:58:03.176 --> 01:58:04.544
ARE THERE ARE THINGS THAT NOT

01:58:04.610 --> 01:58:06.579
BEING CONSIDERED HERE -- THE

01:58:06.646 --> 01:58:07.680
MORE LUXURY WE WE THOUGHT ABOUT

01:58:07.747 --> 01:58:09.849
HAVING EXPLORED MUCH IN DETAIL

01:58:09.916 --> 01:58:10.783
BESIDES THE STUFF THAT'S BEEN

01:58:10.850 --> 01:58:12.318
FOR NOW ABOUT SORT OF INCREASING

01:58:12.385 --> 01:58:13.252
REVENUES SO FORTH IS.

01:58:13.319 --> 01:58:14.587
TAKEN THE CLOSER LOOK AT SOME OF

01:58:14.654 --> 01:58:16.155
THE OTHER EXPENDITURES FROM THE

01:58:16.222 --> 01:58:17.590
NBA IN ADDITION THE AMBIANCE IS

01:58:17.657 --> 01:58:19.225
P. WE GIVE MONEY TO AIR

01:58:19.292 --> 01:58:19.959
RESOURCES BOARD.

01:58:20.026 --> 01:58:21.794
FORD TO MITIGATE ENVIRONMENTAL

01:58:21.861 --> 01:58:23.563
EFFECTS FROM VEHICLE EMISSIONS

01:58:23.629 --> 01:58:24.464
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THERE COULD

01:58:24.530 --> 01:58:25.832
BE SOME OTHER FUN SOURCES THAT

01:58:25.898 --> 01:58:26.933
THEY ARE BE HAS THAT THOSE COULD

01:58:26.999 --> 01:58:28.201
BE FUNDED FOR I KNOW THEY HAVE

01:58:28.267 --> 01:58:29.969
SOME SPECIAL FUNDS AT THAT ALSO

01:58:30.036 --> 01:58:30.536
HAVE SOME.

01:58:30.603 --> 01:58:31.938
ISSUESAS WELL BUT THERE COULD

01:58:32.004 --> 01:58:33.339
BE SOME THAT.

01:58:33.406 --> 01:58:34.974
ME MAYBE TO FIND AN ALTERNATE

01:58:35.041 --> 01:58:35.641
FUNDING SOURCE THAT WOULD FREE

01:58:35.708 --> 01:58:37.210
UP MOTOR VEHICLE OUT FUNDS THAT

01:58:37.276 --> 01:58:41.948
COULD FIND OTHER EXPENDITURES SO

01:58:42.014 --> 01:58:42.548
THAT'S SOMETHING WE COULD LOOK

01:58:42.615 --> 01:58:44.317
INTO MORE.

01:58:44.383 --> 01:58:45.551
FORTY OKAY THIS DOES BY A

02:00:38.631 --> 02:00:41.133
MORE BUT THE FLIP SIDE IS IF

02:00:41.200 --> 02:00:44.370
THESE PROJECTS ARE STALLED FOR A

02:00:44.437 --> 02:00:46.038
NUMBER OF YEARS.

02:00:46.105 --> 02:00:47.340
THE PROJECT STILL NEED TO BE

02:00:47.406 --> 02:00:49.842
COMPLETED AND SO THERE'S GOING

02:00:49.909 --> 02:00:51.110
TO BE TO INCREASE THE COST OF

02:00:51.177 --> 02:00:52.678
CONSTRUCTION IN THE OUT YEARS

02:00:52.745 --> 02:00:54.113
VERSUS BEING ABLE TO START THE

02:00:54.180 --> 02:00:57.416
PROJECTS NOW -- A LOT OF TIMES

02:00:57.483 --> 02:00:59.218
THERE'S A DISCUSSION THAT IT'S

02:00:59.285 --> 02:01:00.553
JUST LOOK AT THE STREET CASH

02:01:00.620 --> 02:01:03.255
BASIS BUT A DOLLAR -- THAT

02:01:03.322 --> 02:01:05.658
DOLLARS FIFTEEN OR TWENTY OR

02:01:05.725 --> 02:01:06.492
TWENTY FIVE YEARS FROM NOW IS

02:01:06.559 --> 02:01:08.594
NOT WORTH AS MUCH AS A A DOLLAR

02:01:08.661 --> 02:01:10.162
TODAY.

02:01:10.229 --> 02:01:11.430
OKAY SO YOU AND I I THINK IN THE

02:01:11.497 --> 02:01:13.032
BROADER POINT IS IT'S NOT JUST

02:01:13.099 --> 02:01:15.601
THE THE THE LEAST BONDS IT'S

02:01:15.668 --> 02:01:17.570
IT'S COMBINED WITH THE MADE WE

02:01:17.637 --> 02:01:18.337
CAN LOOK AT THINGS THROUGH A

02:01:18.404 --> 02:01:19.639
STRAW SO.

02:01:19.705 --> 02:01:20.706
THAT IN ADDITION TO WHAT MR

02:01:20.773 --> 02:01:22.908
MULLIN BROUGHT UP ABOUT THE THE

02:01:22.975 --> 02:01:24.143
THE THE PENSION PAYMENTS

02:01:24.210 --> 02:01:25.845
EVERYTHING ELSE SO.

02:01:25.911 --> 02:01:28.347
HOLISTICALLY ME YOU MAY BE.

02:01:28.414 --> 02:01:29.582
YOU KNOW YOU MADE SAVE A LITTLE

02:01:29.649 --> 02:01:32.585
IN IN IN THE MIDDLE BUT THEN.

02:01:32.652 --> 02:01:33.452
YOU KNOW TEN YEARS NOW WE NOW

02:01:33.519 --> 02:01:34.820
WE'VE GOT INTEREST PAYMENTS THAT

02:01:34.887 --> 02:01:36.288
WE GONNA DO ON THESE BONDS AND

02:01:36.355 --> 02:01:36.989
THEN WE'VE GOT.

02:01:37.056 --> 02:01:38.624
ADDITIONAL DEBT SERVICE ON ON

02:01:38.691 --> 02:01:40.126
PENSIONS AND THEN WE REAP WE'RE

02:01:40.192 --> 02:01:42.628
GONNA RELITIGATE WHAT WE DID THE

02:01:42.695 --> 02:01:43.863
WHATEVER THE PREVIOUS ISSUE ON

02:01:43.929 --> 02:01:45.231
THE TRUCK WAIT FEES WHERE YOU'RE

02:01:45.297 --> 02:01:45.931
JUST GONNA BE MOVING MONEY

02:01:45.998 --> 02:01:46.599
AROUND.

02:01:46.666 --> 02:01:47.933
AND THE WHERE IT WENT AND WE

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:49.602
HAVEN'T MADE THE FUND ANYMORE

02:01:49.669 --> 02:01:51.937
SOLVENTS SO I THINK THAT'S I

02:01:52.004 --> 02:01:53.706
MEAN SO THAT'S I GUESS THE MY

02:01:53.773 --> 02:01:55.808
GENERAL CONCERNED THAT I'M

02:01:55.875 --> 02:01:56.742
TRYING TO GET YOU.

02:01:56.809 --> 02:01:58.044
TO I'M TRYING TO TEASE OUT FROM

02:01:58.110 --> 02:02:01.113
YOU IS THAT ARE THOSE IS THERE A

02:02:01.180 --> 02:02:03.082
TEN YEAR PLAN INSTEAD OF MORE A

02:02:03.149 --> 02:02:04.817
FIVE YEAR PLAN OR OR MAYBE WE'RE

02:02:04.884 --> 02:02:10.556
JUST LOOKING AT THINGS FROM A

02:02:10.623 --> 02:02:13.292
FIVE YEAR LEVEL.

02:02:13.359 --> 02:02:15.561
I I'VE I WILL NOTE -- AGAIN

02:02:15.628 --> 02:02:17.129
WHILE WE'RE DELAYING THE PENSION

02:02:17.196 --> 02:02:18.731
PAYMENTS.

02:02:18.798 --> 02:02:21.200
WE DO SEE THAT RESERVE BEGAN TO

02:02:21.267 --> 02:02:24.336
GROW EVEN THOUGH IN TWENTY THREE

02:02:24.403 --> 02:02:25.071
TWENTY FOUR WERE MAKING A

02:02:25.137 --> 02:02:26.372
HUNDRED FORTY MILLION DOLLAR

02:02:26.439 --> 02:02:26.605
PAYMENT.

02:02:26.672 --> 02:02:27.707
SO.

02:02:27.773 --> 02:02:30.242
YOU KNOW IT.

02:02:30.309 --> 02:02:30.576
THERE'S ALSO.

02:02:30.643 --> 02:02:32.712
AM.

02:02:32.778 --> 02:02:34.280
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WHAT REVENUES

02:02:34.346 --> 02:02:38.818
MIGHT BE THEY MAY BE MUCH HIGHER --

02:02:38.884 --> 02:02:40.619
I'LL ALSO NOTE THAT -- THE

02:02:40.686 --> 02:02:42.555
ADMINISTRATION HAS.

02:02:42.621 --> 02:02:46.325
PROPOSED -- OF THIS YEAR A THREE

02:02:46.392 --> 02:02:48.194
BILLION DOLLARS -- GENERAL FUND

02:02:48.260 --> 02:02:50.229
PENSION PAYMENT -- TO CALPERS

02:02:50.296 --> 02:02:53.165
AND THAT PAYMENT -- SAVES THE

02:02:53.232 --> 02:02:54.900
NVA AN ESTIMATED SIXTY SEVEN

02:02:54.967 --> 02:02:57.236
MILLION OVER OVER THE NEXT TEN

02:02:57.303 --> 02:03:00.873
YEARS -- SO THE THOSE --

02:03:00.940 --> 02:03:02.441
PAYMENTS THAT ARE NOT COMING OUT

02:03:02.508 --> 02:03:04.343
OF THE NBA.

02:03:04.410 --> 02:03:05.311
I WOULD JUST ADD ON WE WE DO

02:03:05.377 --> 02:03:06.912
BELIEVE THAT THAT EVEN THOUGH WE

02:03:06.979 --> 02:03:09.014
ARE ADDRESSING A SHORT TERM AND

02:03:09.081 --> 02:03:10.049
PUSHING SOME OF THESE OUT TO

02:03:10.116 --> 02:03:10.983
LONG TERM THE IN THE LONG TERM

02:03:11.050 --> 02:03:12.618
IT CAN'T IT CAN'T HANDLE IT BUT

02:03:12.685 --> 02:03:15.821
OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE TO MONITOR --

02:03:15.888 --> 02:03:17.423
CLOSELY AND SEE WHAT AS YOU

02:03:17.490 --> 02:03:18.591
NOTED YOUNG EMPLOYEE

02:03:18.657 --> 02:03:20.392
COMPENSATION COSTS ARE YOU THINK

02:03:20.459 --> 02:03:22.027
THINGS THINGS DO CHANGE BUT

02:03:22.094 --> 02:03:24.964
AGAIN EVEN IN THAT LAST YEAR THE

02:03:25.030 --> 02:03:26.899
FUND CONDITION WHERE WE ADDED.

02:03:26.966 --> 02:03:29.702
XIN BACK IN -- THE FUND BOUNCE A

02:03:29.769 --> 02:03:30.569
STOCKBROKER RIGHT AND I CAN AND

02:03:30.636 --> 02:03:31.771
I APPRECIATE THAT I I'M JUST

02:03:31.837 --> 02:03:32.538
TRYING TO KIND OF GLEE MORE

02:03:32.605 --> 02:03:34.106
INFORMATION AND AND I APPRECIATE

02:03:34.173 --> 02:03:35.708
THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FOR

02:03:35.775 --> 02:03:36.509
THREE BILLION DOLLAR DOWN

02:03:36.575 --> 02:03:37.009
PAYMENT.

02:03:37.076 --> 02:03:38.744
ATTHAT THAT MAKES SENSE TO ME

02:03:38.811 --> 02:03:40.813
IT IT BUT THERE WERE WE'RE NOT

02:03:40.880 --> 02:03:42.748
MAKING ANOTHER PAYMENT AND SO

02:03:42.815 --> 02:03:43.716
WERE THE WERE LOW IN THE COST

02:03:43.783 --> 02:03:45.251
AND ONE AND AND THEY WERE

02:03:45.317 --> 02:03:46.152
INCREASING THE COST AND THE

02:03:46.218 --> 02:03:47.219
OTHER BECAUSE WE'VE W'VE

02:03:47.286 --> 02:03:48.487
STOPPED MAKING A PAYMENT ON

02:03:48.554 --> 02:03:49.889
SOMETHING ELSE.

02:03:49.955 --> 02:03:52.491
SO I THINK FROM FOR JUST AND AS

02:03:52.558 --> 02:03:53.726
IT MYSELF AND I DON'T KNOW I WAS

02:03:53.793 --> 02:03:54.794
THE FOR THE FULL COMMITTEE IS

02:03:54.860 --> 02:03:55.895
THAT A MAYBE WE HAD A MORE

02:03:55.961 --> 02:03:58.697
LONGER TERM -- PLAN -- IN

02:03:58.764 --> 02:04:04.270
ADDITION TO EVERYTHING ELSE -- I

02:04:04.336 --> 02:04:04.870
THINK THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL SO

02:04:04.937 --> 02:04:07.072
THANK YOU.

02:04:07.139 --> 02:04:08.841
MS REST FALL BY MISTER PATTERSON.

02:04:08.908 --> 02:04:09.742
THANK YOU I THINK IT'S CLEAR

02:04:09.809 --> 02:04:10.876
FROM THIS DISCUSSION THAT THERE

02:04:10.943 --> 02:04:11.977
ARE STRUCTURAL DEFICITS HERE.

02:04:12.044 --> 02:04:12.745
THAT WE'RE STILL PLEASE THERE

02:04:12.812 --> 02:04:15.514
ARE SOME SERIOUS PROBLEMS -- I

02:04:15.581 --> 02:04:16.749
APPRECIATED FROM THE ALEJO'S

02:04:16.816 --> 02:04:19.251
COMMENTS ON PAGE.

02:04:19.318 --> 02:04:20.586
THIRTY TWO OF TALKING ABOUT THE

02:04:20.653 --> 02:04:21.821
TO EVALUATIONS THAT ARE BEING

02:04:21.887 --> 02:04:23.155
THAT BEING UNDERTAKEN OUT OF

02:04:23.222 --> 02:04:24.323
PARTNER FINANCING GOVERNMENT

02:04:24.390 --> 02:04:25.758
OPERATIONS.

02:04:25.825 --> 02:04:27.426
AGENCY.

02:04:27.493 --> 02:04:29.528
BUT ALSO TO CONSIDER DIRECTING

02:04:29.595 --> 02:04:31.130
THE DEPARTMENT AGENCY TO SUBMIT

02:04:31.197 --> 02:04:32.665
A REPORT.

02:04:32.731 --> 02:04:34.800
AT SPRING BUDGET A POTENTIALLY

02:04:34.867 --> 02:04:36.202
FISSION SEES.

02:04:36.268 --> 02:04:37.570
IS THE DEPARTMENT PREPARED TO DO

02:04:37.636 --> 02:04:46.045
THAT [inaudible]

02:04:46.111 --> 02:04:49.949
YEAH THAT'S I WILL SPEK TO THAT

02:04:50.015 --> 02:04:51.050
FROM A THE KATHY WHITE ACTING

02:04:51.116 --> 02:04:54.320
DIRECTOR OF DMV SO WITH REGARDS.

02:04:54.386 --> 02:04:55.721
TO PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS BUSINESS

02:04:55.788 --> 02:04:58.524
RE ENGINEERING COST SAVINGS THAT

02:04:58.591 --> 02:05:00.125
IS SOMETHING THAT DMV HAS

02:05:00.192 --> 02:05:01.927
EMBRACED BUT I ALSO TELL YOU

02:05:01.994 --> 02:05:03.963
THERE'S A LOT MORE OPPORTUNITY.

02:05:04.029 --> 02:05:05.764
TO LOOK AT GAINING EFFICIENCIES

02:05:05.831 --> 02:05:07.466
AND HOW WE RUN OUR OPERATIONS.

02:05:07.533 --> 02:05:09.768
I WILL ALSO TELL YOU -- BASED ON

02:05:09.835 --> 02:05:12.538
MY SHORT TENURE AT DMV --

02:05:12.605 --> 02:05:13.973
THERE'S A LOT THAT WE DO THIS

02:05:14.039 --> 02:05:15.774
VERY MANUALLY ORIENTED THAT IF

02:05:15.841 --> 02:05:17.176
WE ACTUALLY LEVERAGE BETTER

02:05:17.243 --> 02:05:18.277
TECHNOLOGY.

02:05:18.344 --> 02:05:19.678
AND LOOKED AT WAYS TO AUTOMATE

02:05:19.745 --> 02:05:21.447
WHICH ACTUALLY GAIN A LOT OF

02:05:21.513 --> 02:05:23.015
EFFICIENCIES THERE SO DMV IS

02:05:23.082 --> 02:05:24.884
RIGHT -- AND WE CERTAINLY

02:05:24.950 --> 02:05:27.686
LOOKING AT THOSE OPPORTUNITIES --

02:05:27.753 --> 02:05:29.688
ACTION ACTIVITY THINGS THAT WE

02:05:29.755 --> 02:05:30.789
CAN MEASURE FROM A KEY

02:05:30.856 --> 02:05:32.758
PERFORMANCE INDICATOR -- WHAT'S

02:05:32.825 --> 02:05:33.993
THE RETURN ON INVESTMENT BACK TO

02:05:34.059 --> 02:05:35.461
OUR CUSTOMERS WHEN WE ACTUALLY

02:05:35.527 --> 02:05:37.162
GAIN THOSE EFFICIENCIES CAN WE

02:05:37.229 --> 02:05:38.898
PROCESS THINGS MORE QUICKLY THAN

02:05:38.964 --> 02:05:40.032
WE CURRENTLY DO.

02:05:40.099 --> 02:05:41.267
WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT MOVING

02:05:41.333 --> 02:05:42.868
IN THAT DIRECTION BUT I WILL

02:05:42.935 --> 02:05:44.336
TELL YOU THERE HAS TO BE AN UP

02:05:44.403 --> 02:05:46.739
FRONT INVESTMENT. TO ACHIEVE

02:05:46.805 --> 02:05:48.807
THAT STATE TO THEN ALSO GAIN THE

02:05:48.874 --> 02:05:50.409
EFFICIENCIES SO I THINK.

02:05:50.476 --> 02:05:51.410
GOING BACK TO WHAT THE LA ALWAYS

02:05:51.477 --> 02:05:52.478
TALKED ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:05:52.544 --> 02:05:54.847
FINANCE I THINK THERE'S SOME

02:05:54.914 --> 02:05:56.448
IMMEDIATE SHORT TERM NEEDS.

02:05:56.515 --> 02:05:58.250
BUT I KNOW FROM A DMV STANDPOINT

02:05:58.317 --> 02:05:59.418
THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IN THE

02:05:59.485 --> 02:06:01.353
AGENCY WE ARE COMMITTED TO ALSO

02:06:01.420 --> 02:06:03.455
LOOKING AT HOW THE DMV CAN

02:06:03.522 --> 02:06:04.690
BETTER SERVE OUR CUSTOMERS IN A

02:06:04.757 --> 02:06:06.025
MORE EFFICIENT.

02:06:06.091 --> 02:06:07.493
AND EFFECTIVE WAY AND AND MORE

02:06:07.559 --> 02:06:10.095
COST EFFECTIVE WAY AND WE WILL

02:06:10.162 --> 02:06:11.797
CONTINUE TO DO THAT I AM FOR

02:06:11.864 --> 02:06:13.132
THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW.

02:06:13.198 --> 02:06:14.934
I ESTABLISHED THE CALIFORNIA

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:16.702
LEAN ACADEMY HERE IN THE STATE

02:06:16.769 --> 02:06:18.103
OF CALIFORNIA HI.

02:06:18.170 --> 02:06:20.072
I BELIEVE IN PROCESS PREVENT ITS

02:06:20.139 --> 02:06:22.308
EVERY FIBER OF HOW I GO INTO AN

02:06:22.374 --> 02:06:24.143
ORGANIZATION OPERATE.

02:06:24.209 --> 02:06:25.277
AND IF I AM ALLOWED TO DO THAT

02:06:25.344 --> 02:06:27.680
DMV WE WILL BRING THAT TO DMV.

02:06:27.746 --> 02:06:29.448
BUT IT WILL TAKE TIME WITH EVERY

02:06:29.515 --> 02:06:30.983
PRODUCT LINE I NEED TO GO IN

02:06:31.050 --> 02:06:31.917
THERE AND SEE WHERE THE

02:06:31.984 --> 02:06:33.819
EFFICIENCIES ARE THAT WE CAN

02:06:33.886 --> 02:06:38.057
GAIN FOR ALL OF THOSE PRODUCT

02:06:38.123 --> 02:06:39.591
LINES.

02:06:39.658 --> 02:06:41.126
YOU SAY IF YOU'RE ALLOWED.

02:06:41.193 --> 02:06:42.328
TO IS THERE AN ISSUE ABOUT THAT

02:06:42.394 --> 02:06:43.295
WELL I'M CURRENTLY IN AN ACTING

02:06:43.362 --> 02:06:45.097
ROLE IN THE EXECUTIVE OFFICE AND

02:06:45.164 --> 02:06:46.899
SO THAT THAT'S ALWAYS DEPENDENT

02:06:46.966 --> 02:06:48.767
ON WHERE THE GOVERNOR WANTS TO

02:06:48.834 --> 02:06:50.469
GO AS WELL AND THE LEGISLATURE

02:06:50.536 --> 02:06:50.703
TO MAKE.

02:06:50.769 --> 02:06:52.771
CORRECT.

02:06:52.838 --> 02:06:54.373
I THINK THAT THE KNOWING THE DMV

02:06:54.440 --> 02:06:56.075
HAS BEEN IN THE NEWS FOR SO LONG

02:06:56.141 --> 02:06:57.609
I THINK THAT.

02:06:57.676 --> 02:07:00.279
I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT WE DON'T

02:07:00.346 --> 02:07:01.981
HAVE SOMETHING ALREADY.

02:07:02.047 --> 02:07:03.916
IN PLACE.

02:07:03.983 --> 02:07:05.150
IT'S JUST AS MR FUNG'S TALKED

02:07:05.217 --> 02:07:07.853
ABOUT NOT JUST A FIVE YEAR PLAN

02:07:07.920 --> 02:07:09.088
BUT A TEN YEAR PLAN.

02:07:09.154 --> 02:07:10.990
THIS HAS TO BE PART OF A

02:07:11.056 --> 02:07:13.826
DEPARTMENT WITH SUCH STRUCTURAL

02:07:13.892 --> 02:07:15.894
DEFICITS.

02:07:15.961 --> 02:07:16.495
IF WE CONTINUE THE WHERE WE'RE

02:07:16.562 --> 02:07:18.364
GOING.

02:07:18.430 --> 02:07:19.565
WITHOUT THE ADJUSTMENTS THAT

02:07:19.631 --> 02:07:21.133
HAVE BEEN TALKED ABOUT.

02:07:21.200 --> 02:07:22.835
WE CAN'T CONTINUE PERIOD.

02:07:22.901 --> 02:07:25.571
SO -- IT.

02:07:25.637 --> 02:07:27.139
I GUESS IT'S SORT OF SURPRISES

02:07:27.206 --> 02:07:28.807
ME THAT WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE HERE

02:07:28.874 --> 02:07:30.509
AND WE'RE THE NUMBERS ARE

02:07:30.576 --> 02:07:35.080
LOOKING THE WAY THEY'RE LOOKING --

02:07:35.147 --> 02:07:37.216
SO THAT TEN YEAR PLAN.

02:07:37.282 --> 02:07:38.851
RATHER THAN A FIVE YEAR PLAN IS

02:07:38.917 --> 02:07:40.919
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT.

02:07:40.986 --> 02:07:43.155
AND I HOPE THAT SUCH A REPORT AS

02:07:43.222 --> 02:07:45.557
WELL AS RECOMMENDED BY THE LA --

02:07:45.624 --> 02:07:47.092
IS SOMETHING THAT WILL BE LOOKED

02:07:47.159 --> 02:07:50.596
AT WILL BE PREPARED SO THAT WE

02:07:50.662 --> 02:07:51.230
CAN.

02:07:51.296 --> 02:07:53.565
AB -- SO WHEN WE EVALUATE WE

02:07:53.632 --> 02:07:55.100
HAVE SOMETHING TO BASE IT ON AND

02:07:55.167 --> 02:07:56.935
I THINK THAT THOSE OF YOU ON THE

02:07:57.002 --> 02:07:58.837
INSIDE WOULD BETTER KNOW WHERE

02:07:58.904 --> 02:08:01.573
THE EFFICIENCIES.

02:08:01.640 --> 02:08:03.575
AND INEFFICIENCIES ARE AND WHAT

02:08:03.642 --> 02:08:05.344
NEEDS TO BE CHANGED.

02:08:05.411 --> 02:08:07.079
SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE

02:08:07.146 --> 02:08:10.382
DEFICITS THAT WE DO HAVE.

02:08:10.449 --> 02:08:10.816
THANK YOU.

02:08:10.883 --> 02:08:13.152
MISTER PATTERSON [inaudible]

02:08:13.218 --> 02:08:16.422
YES -- AGAIN.

02:08:16.488 --> 02:08:18.724
I WANT TO FOCUS ON APPROPRIATE

02:08:18.791 --> 02:08:20.125
USE OF FUNDS.

02:08:20.192 --> 02:08:21.593
AND THE STRUCTURAL [inaudible]

02:08:21.660 --> 02:08:24.296
DEFICIT.

02:08:24.363 --> 02:08:26.265
IT REALLY CONCERNS ME THAT WE

02:08:26.331 --> 02:08:29.134
HAVE A FUND THAT.

02:08:29.201 --> 02:08:31.503
I SUPPOSE ORIGINALLY STARTED TO

02:08:31.570 --> 02:08:33.705
FIND DMV.

02:08:33.772 --> 02:08:36.475
AND C. H. P. AND YET WE HAVE.

02:08:36.542 --> 02:08:39.278
LOADED UP ON THIS BOND A LOT OF

02:08:39.344 --> 02:08:40.746
EXPENDITURES.

02:08:40.813 --> 02:08:42.347
MY QUESTION IS WHAT WITH THIS

02:08:42.414 --> 02:08:44.516
FUN LOOK LIKE IF WE ZEROED OUT

02:08:44.583 --> 02:08:46.118
ALL OF THE OTHER.

02:08:46.185 --> 02:08:48.487
USES OF THOSE PLANS EXCEPT FOR

02:08:48.554 --> 02:08:50.656
THE PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY OF

02:08:50.722 --> 02:09:01.100
THE C. H. P. IN THE DMV.

02:09:01.166 --> 02:09:01.700
AS NOTED IN A GENDER -- JUST

02:09:01.767 --> 02:09:02.868
CURRENTLY THAT'S ABOUT FOUR

02:09:02.935 --> 02:09:04.336
HUNDRED AND SEVEN MILLION

02:09:04.403 --> 02:09:05.671
DOLLARS A YEAR WOULD WOULD

02:09:05.737 --> 02:09:08.674
ELIMINATE THE SUPPORT FOR A R.

02:09:08.740 --> 02:09:11.243
B. AND I BELIEVE IT'S SIX

02:09:11.310 --> 02:09:11.810
THIRTEEN TO SIXTEEN OTHER.

02:09:11.877 --> 02:09:13.512
DEPARTMENTS THAT RECEIVE SOME

02:09:13.579 --> 02:09:14.847
AMOUNT OF FUNDING FROM THE MOTOR

02:09:14.913 --> 02:09:16.949
VEHICLE.

02:09:17.015 --> 02:09:17.583
WE GET WHAT DOES THAT DO WHAT

02:09:17.649 --> 02:09:18.684
DOES THAT DO TO OTHERS WHAT YOU

02:09:18.750 --> 02:09:19.718
TALK ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION

02:09:19.785 --> 02:09:21.320
DOLLAR RESERVES THAT DO THAT.

02:09:21.386 --> 02:09:22.254
EASILY.

02:09:22.321 --> 02:09:23.755
WHAT WHAT WOULD IF IF YOU'RE

02:09:23.822 --> 02:09:24.256
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS

02:09:24.323 --> 02:09:26.258
ADDITIONAL ME THAT'S USABLE

02:09:26.325 --> 02:09:29.328
MONEY FOR THE C. H. P. N. DMV?

02:09:29.394 --> 02:09:30.496
I WAS A DEMONSTRATION IS NOT

02:09:30.562 --> 02:09:32.030
PROPOSING TO ELIMINATE AND BE

02:09:32.097 --> 02:09:33.665
FUNDING FROM THE AIR RESOURCES

02:09:33.732 --> 02:09:34.266
BOARD OR OTHER DEPARTMENTS BUT

02:09:34.333 --> 02:09:35.367
IF.

02:09:35.434 --> 02:09:37.236
IF YOU WERE TO DO DO YOU FIND

02:09:37.302 --> 02:09:38.203
ALL OF THOSE OTHER DEPARTMENTS

02:09:38.270 --> 02:09:40.172
FROM THE NBA THE BALANCE IN THE

02:09:40.239 --> 02:09:41.540
MOTOR VEHICLE COUNT WOULD GO UP

02:09:41.607 --> 02:09:44.510
BY FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS

02:09:44.576 --> 02:09:45.244
A YEAR.

02:09:45.310 --> 02:09:47.679
THE UNWILLINGNESS TO DO THAT.

02:09:47.746 --> 02:09:48.947
LEADS TO THE INEVITABLE

02:09:49.014 --> 02:09:50.816
STRUCTURAL IMBALANCE THAT WE

02:09:50.883 --> 02:09:53.719
HAVE IN MY JUDGMENT.

02:09:53.785 --> 02:09:55.187
AND I'LL TELL YOU WHERE I FEAR

02:09:55.254 --> 02:09:57.322
THIS INEVITABLY LEADS

02:09:57.389 --> 02:09:57.623
[inaudible]

02:09:57.689 --> 02:10:00.092
MORE FEES.

02:10:00.159 --> 02:10:01.593
ON REGISTRATION.

02:10:01.660 --> 02:10:03.529
HIGHER FEES TO PEOPLE WHO USE

02:10:03.595 --> 02:10:05.797
THE DMV.

02:10:05.864 --> 02:10:08.133
AND SO THE THE DOUBLE THE LAST.

02:10:08.200 --> 02:10:09.902
FOR THE FIRST RESORT FOR THE

02:10:09.968 --> 02:10:12.337
STRUCTURAL IMBALANCE FIXES.

02:10:12.404 --> 02:10:12.971
ALWAYS GOES BACK TO THE PEOPLE

02:10:13.038 --> 02:10:15.841
OF CALIFORNIA.

02:10:15.908 --> 02:10:18.343
AND I JUST WANNA KNOW YOUR

02:10:18.410 --> 02:10:21.113
OPINION OF WHETHER OR NOT THERE

02:10:21.180 --> 02:10:24.149
IS DOWN THE ROAD AND INTENTION.

02:10:24.216 --> 02:10:25.117
TO CLOSE THIS STRUCTURAL

02:10:25.184 --> 02:10:27.886
IMBALANCE.

02:10:27.953 --> 02:10:29.721
BY FEE INCREASES.

02:10:29.788 --> 02:10:35.827
FROM THE PEOPLE WHO USE THE DMV.

02:10:35.894 --> 02:10:37.129
THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL

02:10:37.196 --> 02:10:39.998
SPECIFICALLY DOES NOT INCREASE.

02:10:40.065 --> 02:10:42.834
FEES AND GETS US THROUGH -- THAT

02:10:42.901 --> 02:10:44.469
THE THE FIVE YEAR PERIOD SO THAT

02:10:44.536 --> 02:10:46.672
IS OUR PROPOSAL IS NOT TO

02:10:46.738 --> 02:10:47.272
INCREASE FEES AND A FIVE YEAR

02:10:47.339 --> 02:10:49.041
PERIOD.

02:10:49.107 --> 02:10:50.108
OKAY BUT THAT STILLDOES NOT

02:10:50.175 --> 02:10:51.410
ADDRESS THE FACT THAT YOU COULD

02:10:51.476 --> 02:10:53.145
BE FUNDING MUCH MORE DMV

02:10:53.212 --> 02:10:54.947
ACTIVITY MUCH MORE C. H. P.

02:10:55.013 --> 02:10:56.215
ACTIVITY IF YOU'RE ZEROED OUT

02:10:56.281 --> 02:10:57.583
EVERYTHING ELSE IS COMING OUT OF

02:10:57.649 --> 02:10:59.484
THIS BOUNCE.

02:10:59.551 --> 02:11:01.486
AND THAT'S NOT BEING PROPOSED.

02:11:01.553 --> 02:11:05.691
AGAIN. TO ME THIS FEELS LIKE.

02:11:05.757 --> 02:11:09.461
BUDGET TRICKERY IT FEELS LIKE --

02:11:09.528 --> 02:11:10.696
SHELL GAME.

02:11:10.762 --> 02:11:12.698
ARE WE HAVE A FUND THAT WAS

02:11:12.764 --> 02:11:14.533
ESTABLISHED BY THE FEET PAIRS OF

02:11:14.600 --> 02:11:17.102
CALIFORNIA TO THE DMV. TO DO A

02:11:17.169 --> 02:11:18.837
VERY APPROPRIATE THINGS.

02:11:18.904 --> 02:11:20.839
THE DMV CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY

02:11:20.906 --> 02:11:21.640
PATROL.

02:11:21.707 --> 02:11:24.876
OVER TIME WE ADD UP AND ADD UP

02:11:24.943 --> 02:11:27.112
MORE AND MORE DRAW DOWN. FOR

02:11:27.179 --> 02:11:28.447
PURPOSES THAT ARE UTTERLY

02:11:28.513 --> 02:11:30.983
UNRELATED TO THE FEES THAT THE

02:11:31.049 --> 02:11:34.453
PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA OR PAY.

02:11:34.519 --> 02:11:37.189
I JUST THINK IT ADDS INEVITABLY

02:11:37.256 --> 02:11:39.491
IF WE DON'T MAKE SUBSTANTIAL --

02:11:39.558 --> 02:11:40.759
CUTS AND WHAT ALL THIS

02:11:40.826 --> 02:11:42.661
DISCRETIONARY STUFF.

02:11:42.728 --> 02:11:45.063
WE'RE GONNA END UP I THINK WITH

02:11:45.130 --> 02:11:46.665
THE INCREASES IN FRONT OF US.

02:11:46.732 --> 02:11:47.799
WHETHER WE LIKE IT OR NOT I

02:11:47.866 --> 02:11:49.368
WORRY ABOUT THAT BECAUSE IT'S

02:11:49.434 --> 02:11:50.636
TOO EASY TO GO TO THE FEE PAIRS

02:11:50.702 --> 02:11:52.504
OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO

02:11:52.571 --> 02:11:55.574
FIX STUFF LIKE THIS [inaudible]

02:11:55.641 --> 02:11:57.509
MS RIVER [inaudible]

02:11:57.576 --> 02:11:59.311
I'M.

02:11:59.378 --> 02:12:00.879
I ALSO WANT TO COMMENT ON

02:12:00.946 --> 02:12:02.614
POTENTIAL FEE INCREASES I KNOW

BY INCREASING -- VEHICLE

02:12:10.922 --> 02:12:13.692
REGISTRATION AND OTHER FEES --

02:12:13.759 --> 02:12:15.060
YOU KNOW I HAVE CONCERNS WITH

02:12:15.127 --> 02:12:17.029
HOW THAT IMPACTS LOW INCOME

02:12:17.095 --> 02:12:19.097
COMMUNITIES -- ESPECIALLY AFTER

02:12:19.164 --> 02:12:21.733
WE JUST RAISED FEES THROUGH SB

02:12:21.800 --> 02:12:23.835
ONE ON REGISTRATION FEES -- SO I

02:12:23.902 --> 02:12:25.604

ASSOCIATION HIGH WITH COMMON.

02:19:03.234 --> 02:19:05.236
OF I'VE BEEN REPRESENTING THEM

02:19:05.303 --> 02:19:06.471
FOR FORTY ONE YEARS SO I'M VERY

02:19:06.538 --> 02:19:07.906
FAMILIAR WITH THE NBA COUNT.

02:19:07.972 --> 02:19:09.107
OVER ALL THOSE YEARS AND A

02:19:09.174 --> 02:19:09.741
MILLION AND I THINK WE'VE BEEN

02:19:09.808 --> 02:19:11.309
FIGHTING A STRUCTURAL DEFICIT

02:19:11.376 --> 02:19:13.311
LITERALLY FOR ALMOST ALL THAT

02:19:13.378 --> 02:19:16.281
TIME -- IS IT'S UNFORTUNATE BUT

02:19:16.347 --> 02:19:17.282
IT'S A WAY WHERE IT'S BEEN.

02:19:17.348 --> 02:19:19.117
AND THE LEGISLATURE HAD TO STEP

02:19:19.184 --> 02:19:21.352
IN PERIODICALLY AND ADJUST THE

02:19:21.419 --> 02:19:24.155
FEES BECAUSE IT WAS A FLAT

02:19:24.222 --> 02:19:25.924
DOLLAR AMOUNT IN THE STATUTE.

02:19:25.990 --> 02:19:27.325
SIR EVERY NOW AND THEN YOU HAD

02:19:27.392 --> 02:19:29.160
TO RAISE IT BY FIVE DOLLARS OR

02:19:29.227 --> 02:19:31.096
TEN DOLLARS -- SO FINDING JUST A

02:19:31.162 --> 02:19:33.331
FEW YEARS AGO YOU INDEX TO TO

02:19:33.398 --> 02:19:35.567
THE COLA BUT THAT'S RELATIVELY

02:19:35.633 --> 02:19:38.002
LOW INFLATION IS LIKE TWO TWO

02:19:38.069 --> 02:19:38.837
AND A HALF PERCENT.

02:19:38.903 --> 02:19:40.638
A AND THAT DOESN'T KEEP UP THE

02:19:40.705 --> 02:19:42.607
COST OF FUEL.

02:19:42.674 --> 02:19:43.608
I MEAN GET YOU WE KNOW HOW

02:19:43.675 --> 02:19:46.144
VOLATILE THAT IS AND IS HEADED

02:19:46.211 --> 02:19:48.179
TO FOUR DOLLARS A GALLON.

02:19:48.246 --> 02:19:49.514
FOR US I KNOW THE DEPARTMENT

02:19:49.581 --> 02:19:49.714
MAIS.

02:19:49.781 --> 02:19:51.883
LESS THAN THAT THE COST OF

02:19:51.950 --> 02:19:53.251
SALARIES ACOSTA RENT AND

02:19:53.318 --> 02:19:55.386
MORTGAGES AND PAYMENTS ON

02:19:55.453 --> 02:19:56.688
EVERYTHING THEY THEY OPERATE.

02:19:56.755 --> 02:19:58.656
WILL WILL NECESSITATE YOU TO

02:19:58.723 --> 02:19:59.991
HAVE TO DO ANOTHER.

02:20:00.058 --> 02:20:02.727
SOME DOLLAR INCREASE IN THE AND

02:20:02.794 --> 02:20:03.361
THE THE QUESTION IS WHEN ARE YOU

02:20:03.428 --> 02:20:04.863
GOING TO DO IT -- BUT YOU'LL BE

02:20:04.929 --> 02:20:06.131

TRYING TO PATCH IT UP WITH.

02:20:11.870 --> 02:20:13.872
YOU KNOW.

02:20:13.938 --> 02:20:15.140
STOPPING THE LEAGUE FROM THE DMV

02:20:15.206 --> 02:20:15.673
MONEY THAT'S REYES OUT OF

02:20:15.740 --> 02:20:17.108
SELLING INFORMATION TO INSURANCE

02:20:17.175 --> 02:20:17.976
COMPANIES THAT SORT OF THING --

02:20:18.042 --> 02:20:20.445
THAT MONEY SHOULD STAY IN THE

02:20:20.512 --> 02:20:21.746
NBA IN MY OPINION.

02:20:21.813 --> 02:20:24.349
BUT IT'S BEEN TAKEN FOR DECADES

02:20:24.415 --> 02:20:25.850
NOT JUST RECENTLY THAT'S BEEN

02:20:25.917 --> 02:20:27.986
GOING ON FOR AS LONG AS I CAN

02:20:28.052 --> 02:20:30.588
RECALL -- SO I'M HERE TO SAY

02:20:30.655 --> 02:20:33.758
THAT THE CHP IS LEAN IS ANY

02:20:33.825 --> 02:20:36.294
DEPARTMENT YOU'LL REVIEW.

02:20:36.361 --> 02:20:37.962
I CHALLENGE ANY OTHER DEPARTMENT

02:20:38.029 --> 02:20:39.931
TO SHOW WHERE THEY HAVE FEWER

02:20:39.998 --> 02:20:41.833
EMPLOYEES AND THEY HAD TEN YEARS

02:20:41.900 --> 02:20:42.867
AGO.

02:20:42.934 --> 02:20:45.470

02:20:47.672 --> 02:20:48.573
AGO.

02:20:48.640 --> 02:20:50.308
THE POPULATION HAS INCREASED THE

WHICH DOJ WILL BE PROVIDING

02:31:45.262 --> 02:31:46.530
